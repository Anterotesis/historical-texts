I take little Notice of the numerous declamatory Parts of my Oppo&s;er's Performance. It concerns not the ingenuous Reader, who can be mo&s;t keen or mo&s;t petulent, but on which Side of the Que&s;tion the Truth lies, and by which Doctrine his Mind is mo&s;t likely to be be&s;t and mo&s;t profitably informed.

<HEAD>THE ORIGINAL AND PRESENT STATE OF MAN, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>1.</HI> Man was originally created in Purity, and in a State of due Order and Rectitude. <HI>2.</HI> He was in&s;pired with a Sen&s;e of his Duty; and <HI>3</HI> and <HI>4,</HI> impowered to perform it. <HI>5.</HI> Being tempted, he lap&s;ed from his proper Guard, the pre&s;erving Power of God, into Sin. <HI>6.</HI> He fell from the Image of the Hea|venly, into the Image of the Earthly. How unlawful Self ro&s;e in him. <HI>7.</HI> That he really &s;uffered Death in Spirit, in the Day of his Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. What the Life and Death of the Soul are.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. IN the Beginning God created all Things good. Inherently and immutably good him&s;elf, every Production of his mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily be &s;o, according to the &s;everal Kinds wherein he created them. As Man was wholly made by him, he mu&s;t have been made wholly good; his Nature clear of all Impurity, and free from all Defect and Di&s;order. His Facul|ties
<PB N="2" REF="021391_0006_0FB3690E2346E628">were not imperfect, but limited to their proper Sphere, and every Part of his Compo|&s;ition con&s;tituted in its due Rectitude; the Body placed in Sub&s;ervience to his rational Spirit, or Soul, as to the more noble and excellent, and therefore the &s;uperior Part, made for Immortality, and in Subjection only to the Guidance of its Creator.</P>
<P N="2">2. The human Faculties, or Powers of Capacity, mu&s;t then be clear, unprejudiced, and fit to receive Impre&s;&s;ions, yet void of any but tho&s;e of immediate Sen&s;e. Man, merely as Man, could not originally bring any real Knowledge into the World with him. That mu&s;t either be immediately communicated to him by his Maker, or afterwards acquired by him&s;elf, through Ob&s;ervation and Experience. The latter required Time to effect; and as it was requi&s;ite to his Situation, that he &s;hould be immediately endued with &s;uch an Under|&s;tanding of him&s;elf, and his Creator, as related to his pre&s;ent Duty, and affected his Felicity, he certainly was, by Divine Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s, timely furni&s;hed with it.</P>
<P N="3">3. Man mu&s;t not only <HI>then</HI> be &s;upplied with a due Degree of Light and Under&s;tanding, but he mu&s;t al&s;o be impowered to act up to it, el&s;e his Knowledge would have been afforded him in vain. Yet, though he certainly was thus impowered, the Sequel manife&s;ted he was placed in a State of Probation, otherwi&s;e, he could never have been guilty of the lea&s;t Failure; for his Maker being e&s;&s;entially and unchangeably good, mu&s;t have fixed him in a State of immutable Virtue and Goodne&s;s, had be determined to fix him at all.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="3" REF="021391_0007_0FB3690F23A66760">
4. As the omni&s;cient Creator mo&s;t certainly fore&s;aw what a &s;ubtle Adver&s;ary Man would have to encounter, he as &s;urely furni&s;hed him with Means &s;ufficient to di&s;cover his Snares, and re&s;i&s;t his A&s;&s;aults. If Satan was &s;uffered to u&s;e his Subtlety and Influence to deceive him, doubtle&s;s he was not only warned, but al&s;o endued with a Sufficiency of Divine Light and Influence to with&s;tand his Attempts, as he kept duly upon his Watch.</P>
<P>Nothing but the Divine Nature can enable any intelligent Creature to re&s;i&s;t Temptation, and act up to the Divine Will. If therefore any created Being is required to keep up there|unto, it mu&s;t be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Divine Power &s;o to do. God created Man for a Purpo&s;e of his own Glory. To glorify God, and to partake of his Glory, Man mu&s;t walk in Obedience to his Will. Man could neither infallibly know his Will, nor con&s;tantly perform it, merely by the Strength of his own Faculties; he mu&s;t therefore, nece&s;&s;arily have been a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Spirit of God, to enable him to perform his Will, and &s;o to obey him as to glorify him, and enjoy a ble&s;&s;ed Inheritance in him; other|wi&s;e, the End of Man's Creation could not be an&s;wered. Hence it is concluded, the fir&s;t Man <HI>Adam</HI> was made a <HI>living Soul</HI> by the In&s;pi|ration of the &s;econd <HI>Adam</HI> Chri&s;t, who is a <HI>quickening Spirit;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. xv. 45, 46.</NOTE> for <Q>that was not fir&s;t which is &s;piritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is &s;piritual.</Q> That is, <HI>Adam</HI> was fir&s;t created a natural Man, and then rendered a &s;piritual One by the quickening Power of the Spirit of Chri&s;t, which is the
<PB N="4" REF="021391_0008_0FB3691160D2D8E8">true Life, and proper Element for immortal Spirits to live and move in.</P>
<P>Thus the Parents of Mankind, in their origi|nal uncorrupted State, being fit Temples for the Holy Gho&s;t to dwell in, were, as well as the Sanctified in Chri&s;t afterwards, <HI>Partakers of the Divine Nature,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Pet. i. 4.</NOTE> by the internal quick|ening of Divine Life. The Author of the Book of <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> ob&s;erves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wi&s;d. vii.</NOTE> that <HI>Wi&s;dom in all Ages,</HI> and certainly in the fir&s;t and pure&s;t, <HI>entereth Holy Souls:</HI> Which Wi&s;dom he de&s;cribes to be <HI>the Breath of the Power of God, a pure Influence flowing from the Glory of the Almighty, the Brightne&s;s of the everla&s;ting Light, the un&s;potted Mirrour of the Power of God, and the Image of his Goodne&s;s.</HI> This clearly denotes the Spirit of the eternal Son of God him&s;elf, and evidently concurs with tho&s;e Parts of the New Te&s;tament which declare him to be,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. i. 24.</NOTE> <HI>the Power of God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. i. 15.</NOTE> and <HI>the Wi&s;dom of God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">John i. 49.</NOTE> <HI>the true Light, and Life of Men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. iv. 4.</NOTE> the Brightne&s;s of the Father's Glory, and the Image of the invi&s;ible God.</HI></P>
<P>It was undoubtedly in the Light of this <HI>pure Influence</HI> that <HI>Adam</HI> had &s;uch an intuitive Di&s;cerning of the Creation, as enabled him to give Names to them according to their &s;everal Natures.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. ii. 19.</NOTE> For we read, <Q>The Lord God formed every Bea&s;t of the Field, and every Fowl of the Air, and brought them unto <HI>Adam,</HI> to &s;ee what he would call them; and what&s;oever <HI>Adam</HI> called every living Creature that was the Name thereof.</Q></P>
<P>Under this cele&s;tial Enduement, the &s;cared Impre&s;&s;ion of the Divine Image con&s;picuou&s;ly appeared in the fir&s;t of Mankind.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. i. 27.</NOTE> <Q>In the Image of God created he them.</Q></P>
<P N="5"><PB N="5" REF="021391_0009_0FB3691335DAC228">
5. Had Man kept in faithful Obedience to his Heavenly Guide, and rejected the Efforts of the Tempter, he might undoubtedly, in due Time, have been advanced to a Degree of E&s;tabli&s;hment beyond all Po&s;&s;ibility of falling; but not continuing &s;trictly upon his Watch, and, contrary to the Warning before given him, turning his Attention towards the Temptation, when alluringly pre&s;ented, he &s;lipped from his proper Guard; leaving hold of that Spirit wherein his Life and Strength lay, he fell from it, and all its Advantages, out of the Liberty of the Sons of God, into the Bondage of Corruption: A &s;ure Introduction to Mi&s;ery. For as Holine&s;s and Happine&s;s are in&s;eparably united, &s;o Sin and Mi&s;ery are indivi&s;ibly con|nected.</P>
<P>To &s;uppo&s;e, that the Almighty Author of all Good, originally &s;ubjected Man under a moral Nece&s;&s;ity to tran&s;gre&s;s upon the Appear|ance of Temptation, is an Imagination too injurious to the Divine Character to be admit|ted. Our fir&s;t Parents were unque&s;tionably enabled by their Maker to abide in due Watch|fulne&s;s, which would have entitled them to Pre&s;ervation; their Defection from which, was certainly not of him, but of them&s;elves. Had their Lap&s;e been thro' his Will, or intentional Di&s;po&s;ition of Circum&s;tances, &s;o that it mu&s;t inevitably follow, he could not con&s;i&s;tently have &s;entenced them to Puni&s;hment for it; becau&s;e in &s;o doing, they performed his Will, which could not be a Sin again&s;t him.</P>
<P>A dangerous Fondne&s;s to become knowing in Things hurtful, and no Way nece&s;&s;ary, &s;eems to have an early Entrance into the human
<PB N="6" REF="021391_0010_0FB36914F04AA7D8">Mind.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. iii. 5.</NOTE> <Q>In the Day ye eat, your Eyes &s;hall be opened, and ye &s;hall be as Gods, know|ing Good and Evil.</Q> By the Sugge&s;tion of this flattering Falthood, <HI>Eve</HI> was deceived. Knowing nothing but Good, &s;he might have remained happy; but experiencing Evil, &s;he became otherwi&s;e. This Knowledge is as oppo&s;ite to that of the Divine Wi&s;dom, as Darkne&s;s is to Light. It is certain the Om|ni&s;cient knows both Good and Evil, but he knows the fir&s;t by immutable Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and perfect Enjoyment, and the la&s;t he beholds with Abhorrence, in eternal Oppo&s;ition to, and infinite Di&s;tance from the Purity of his Nature. With &s;inful Man the Ca&s;e is rever&s;e, Evil having immediate Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him, and Good being out of his Reach, without divine Mercy, he mu&s;t be completely wretched. This is the nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence of that boa&s;ted Know|ledge of the World, which Men acquire by ta&s;ting the pernicious and poi&s;onous Sweets of Temptation.</P>
<P N="6">6. The Con&s;equences of this primary Lap&s;e were immediately affecting to the actual Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ors, and remotely to all their Po&s;terity. 1. They lo&s;t the bright Impre&s;&s;ion of the Divine Image, and the Felicity attending it. Forfeiting the immediate indwelling and pure Influence of GOD's Holy Spirit, they lo&s;t that Divine Similitude, wherein they had enjoyed internal Light, Life, Love, Goodne&s;s, Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Holine&s;s, and Happine&s;s. That omnipre&s;ent Spirit of Power, Truth and Virtue, which in their original State had been their Comforter, di&s;united from them through Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, now became their Accu&s;er and
<PB N="7" REF="021391_0011_0FB36915E1816868">Convictor. 2. Lap&s;ing from under due and con&s;tant Subjection to the Mind and Spirit of his Creator, the Wid of Man &s;eparated from the Will of God, and became <HI>Self-will.</HI> Self|love in Man was originally and properly placed in Sub&s;ervience to the Love of his Maker, who being in all Re&s;pects ju&s;tly Supreme, had, whil&s;t Man &s;tood in cheerful Obedience, the Supremacy in his Affection; but by his undu|tiful Self-gratification, and letting in the Sugge&s;tion of the Tempter, his chief Love turned from his Maker to him&s;elf. Thus probably inordinate Self-love and Self-will originated in Man, and they always &s;tand in a Will &s;eparate from the Will of God, and a Spirit contrary to his Holy Spirit. This mental Separation opened an ea&s;y Road of Acce&s;s for the Evil Spirit to influence the human Mind towards exterior Objects, and rendered them the Subjects of Temptation. By giving way to carnal Inclinations, Man became carnally|minded, and "to be carnally-minded <HI>is Death."</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. viii. 6.</NOTE></P>
<P N="7">7. When the Sovereign Legi&s;lator fir&s;t added a po&s;itive Law to <HI>Adam,</HI> he pre-denounced <HI>immediate Death</HI> upon him, in Ca&s;e of his Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. ii. 17.</NOTE> <Q>In the Day that thou eate&s;t thereof, thou &s;halt &s;urely die.</Q> This &s;eems to imply a much deeper and more important Meaning than what relates to the Body; a Meaning more immediately affecting to the rational Soul; the Privation of a Life which before Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion it happily enjoyed, and which, by Di&s;obedience, it mu&s;t certainly lo&s;e.

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. IT appears from holy Writ, that previous to our own actual Offences, we are all naturally affected by the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of our Primo-genitors. <Q>By one Man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. v. 12.</NOTE> Sin entered into the World, and Death by Sin, &s;o Death pa&s;&s;ed upon all Men, for that all have &s;inned</Q> This is not to be under&s;tood of the Death of the Body only; for all come into the World in the Image of the earthly, or, void of the quickening and &s;en&s;ible Influence of Divine Life. But this Di&s;advantage, through the Supreme Goodne&s;s, is amply provided for, and there appears no Nece&s;&s;ity to conclude, that we all come into the World ju&s;tly obnoxious to Divine Vengeance, for an Offence committed by our Primo-genitors, before we came into the World. With what Propriety can an Infant in|capable of committing any Crime, be treated as an Offender? The Scripture po&s;itively a&s;&s;ures us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezek. xviii.</NOTE> <HI>God's Ways are equal</HI>&mdash;that <HI>the Sould that &s;in|eth</HI> IT <HI>&s;hall die,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. v. 15 to 20.</NOTE> and <HI>not the Son for the Fault of the Father</HI>&mdash;that <HI>whatever</HI> Adam's <HI>Po&s;terity
<PB N="10" REF="021391_0014_0FB3691FD7240E98">lo&s;t through him, that and more they gain in Chri&s;t;</HI> and undoubtedly, his Mercy and Good|ne&s;s, and the Extent of his Propitiation, are as applicable to Infants, who have not per&s;onally offended, as to Adults who have.</P>
<P N="2">2. The immortal rea&s;onable Soul of Man, in every Individual, appears to be the immediate Production of its Creator; for the Prophet <HI>Zechariah,</HI> &s;peaking of the great Acts of God in Creation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zech. xii. 1.</NOTE> a&s;&s;erts, that <Q>he formeth the Spirit of Man within him.</Q> And in <HI>Eccle&s;.</HI> xii. 7. we read upon the Death of the Body, <Q>Then &s;hall the Du&s;t return to the Earth as it was, and the Spirit &s;hall return unto God who gave it.</Q> The Soul therefore, receiving its Exi&s;tence immediately from the Perfection of unchangeable Purity, can have no original Impurity or Intemperature in its Nature; but being immediately and intimately connected with a &s;en&s;itive Body, and of it&s;elf, unable con&s;tantly to with&s;tand the Eagerne&s;s of the animal Pa&s;&s;ions after Gratifications of a carnal Nature, is liable to be &s;o influenced by them, as to partake with them in their &s;en&s;ual Indul|gencies. In this State the De&s;cendants of <HI>Adam</HI> come into the World, unendued with that divine Life which <HI>Adam</HI> fell from. And who can &s;ay, this might not be admitted in Mercy to all the future Generations of Man|kind? I&s;t. That each &s;ucceding Individual might be prevented from incurring the Guilt of repeating the Sin of our prime Ance&s;tors, and falling from the &s;ame Degree of Innocence, Purity and Divine Enjoyment. 2d. That, by feeling the Infirmity of our own Nature, and the Want of Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance, we might
<PB N="11" REF="021391_0015_0FB3692176A960B0">become the more &s;en&s;ible of our Danger, and nece&s;&s;ary Dependence on our Creator, and thence be continually excited to &s;eek after, and cleave to him, in Watchfulne&s;s, Circum&s;pec|tion and Prayer, in order to obtain a State of Re&s;toration. 3d. That having in Part attained &s;uch a State, our Prudence might be u&s;eful towards our Pre&s;ervation and Growth therein; &s;ince we &s;hould certainly be more a&s;&s;idiou&s;ly concerned, to &s;ecure to our&s;elves a good Con|dition, obtained through Pains and Difficulty, than one we might have been originally placed in without any Care or Trouble to our&s;elves.</P>
<P N="3">3.

4. In the pre&s;ent State of our Nature, the &s;en&s;itive Powers take the Lead of the rational in the fir&s;t Stage of Life, as the Soul brings only a Capacity, without any real Knowledge, or Potency, into the World with it. It acquires its Knowledge by Degrees, enlarging al&s;o in Capacity to receive it gradually. Every one knows, it is not capable at five or ten Years of Age, to comprehend the &s;ame Ideas in the &s;ame Extent, as in riper and more advanced Years. It fir&s;t becomes impre&s;&s;ed with the Images of external Things, pre&s;ented through the corpo|real Organs, and afterwards with tho&s;e mental Ideas inculcated by its primary In&s;tructors, whether true or &s;al&s;e.

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. WHATEVER we may have derived from our Parents, we certainly accumulate to our&s;elves additional Corruption. <Q>All Fle&s;h hath corrupted his Way upon the Earth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. vi. 12</NOTE></Q> Every adult Per&s;on, in his common natural State, mu&s;t, upon &s;erious Introver&s;ion, find in him&s;elf a Pronene&s;s to the Gratifica|tion of <HI>Self,</HI> and the <HI>&s;en&s;ual Part,</HI> an eager Inclination at Times to forbidden Plea&s;ure, an Aver&s;ion to Piety and Holy Walking, a Con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of Guilt, and a fearful Apprehen&s;ion of the Approach of Death. Men generally confe&s;s they have erred and &s;trayed, like lo&s;t Sheep, from the &s;alutary Paths of Virtue and Duty, and that, &s;uch is their Frailty, it is an ea&s;y Thing for them to fall in with Tempta|tion; but hard, if not impo&s;&s;ible, effectually
<PB N="15" REF="021391_0019_0FB36932D705C4B0">to re&s;i&s;t it. Nay, even the high Rewards pro|mi&s;ed to Virtue and a good Life, and the &s;ore Puni&s;hments annexed to Vice and Folly, are altogether in&s;ufficient to retain them in the Practice of the former, or to enable them to conquer the Force of their Inclination to the latter. This demon&s;trates the Corruption of their Nature; and,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. xii. 34.</NOTE> as <Q>out of the Abudance of the Heart, the Mouth &s;peaketh;</Q> &s;o from what lodges or pre&s;ides within, the exterior Practice ari&s;es. The Corruption in the Heart corrupts the Actions, Manners, and Language. Hence all the Irregularities in Conduct, all the prophane and untrue Speeches, all the common complimental Fal&s;hoods, to gratify the Pride and Folly of vain Minds.</P>
<P>As the Origin of Evil in Man, came by transferring his Attention and De&s;ire from his Creator to the Creature, dividing his Will from the Will of God, and his Spirit from the Spirit of God; &s;o the Continuation of Evil in Man is by the Continuance of this Separation, and mu&s;t abide &s;o long as that remains. In this Situa|tion, commonly called <HI>the State of Nature,</HI> we are both unfit for, and unable to enter the Hea|venly Kingdom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. v. 5.</NOTE> which admits of <HI>nothing &s;inful</HI> or <HI>unclean.</HI> It is therefore ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite that Man &s;hould be made Holy, in order to be happy. Holine&s;s cannot unite with Unholi|ne&s;s; nor can Ability ari&s;e from Infirmity. If Pollution can clean&s;e it&s;elf, if Evil can produce Good, if Death can bring forth Life; Man thus corrupted, debilitated and deadened, may di&s;engage, reform, quicken, and re&s;tore him|&s;elf. But it is not in the Power of Man, as &s;uch, to extricate him&s;elf from the Bonds of
<PB N="16" REF="021391_0020_0FB36934A226DBE0">Sin and Death. Yet, as Impurity is the Bar, it mu&s;t be removed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">I&s;a. lix. 2.</NOTE> As <HI>Sin &s;eparates Man from his Maker,</HI> Man mu&s;t be &s;eparated from Sin, or he cannot be reconciled, and united to him. Without Re&s;toration to a State of Holi|ne&s;s, he cannot enjoy the Felicity pertaining to that State;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. xii. 14.</NOTE> for, <Q>without Holine&s;s no Man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord.</Q></P>
<P>How then &s;hall corrupt Man become Holy? How &s;hall he, in a State of utter Incapacity, enter into and maintain a Warfare again&s;t his many and mighty Adver&s;aries, which be&s;et him within and without? What Ability has he to fight his Enemy who is already enchained by him? A Power too &s;trong for Man has got Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; it mu&s;t be a &s;uperior Power to di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;s him, to re&s;cue and re&s;tore Man; and who is &s;ufficient for the&s;e Things? None but his <HI>Omnipotent Creator</HI> was able to unbind and extricate him. But <HI>his Will Adam</HI> had &s;epa|rated from, <HI>his Law</HI> he had tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, <HI>his Command</HI> he had di&s;obeyed, and again&s;t <HI>him alone</HI> he had committed this high Offence. Yet, behold the a&s;toni&s;hing Compa&s;&s;ion and Kind|ne&s;s of infinite Goodne&s;s! An all-&s;ufficient Means was &s;traightway provided, for the Re|demption both of the actual Offenders and all their Progeny. The eternal Word, the Son, the Lamb of God Almighty, gave in&s;tant Demon&s;tration of the Greatne&s;s of Divine Love and Mercy, in then concurring with the Father, to yield him&s;elf up in due Time to take <HI>the Nature of Man upon him,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid ii. 16.</NOTE> and, by re&s;igning it to Suffering and Death, to make it a Propi|tiation for the whole Species; and al&s;o, in immediately,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. xii. 7.</NOTE> and all along, affording <HI>a Mani|fe&s;tation
<PB N="17" REF="021391_0021_0FB369362466B5D8">of his Holy Spirit to every Man to profit withal,</HI> in order to their pre&s;ent Deli|verance from the Power of Sin, and their everla&s;ting Salvation from the certain Effect of abiding therein to the la&s;t, namely, the &s;econd Death.</P>
<P>That Man &s;hould, of him&s;elf, empower him|&s;elf to live in the con&s;tant Practice of cro&s;&s;ing his natural Inclinations and Propen&s;ities, is a wild Pre&s;umption; but that a Spirit infinitely good, and more powerful than all his Enemies, &s;hould &s;o influence, incline, and enable him, is highly rea&s;onable to believe, becau&s;e ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary. By the Help of God's Spirit, Man may, like the Apo&s;tle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. ix. 27.</NOTE> be a&s;&s;i&s;ted to <HI>keep his Body under,</HI> and <HI>bring it into Subjection,</HI> before the Strength of its Pa&s;&s;ions and Affec|tions le&s;&s;en by Decay of Nature; which the rational Faculty can never effectually accom|pli&s;h, even under that Decay, without &s;uperior A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P N="3">3. Neither the Po&s;&s;ibility, nor Probability, of Man's Purification and Sanctification by the Holy Spirit, can rea&s;onably be doubted; for, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> as phy&s;ical Evil, or bodily Pain, has no <HI>&s;ub&s;tantial</HI> Exi&s;tence of its own, but is purely <HI>incidental</HI> to corporeal Nature; &s;o <HI>moral Evil</HI> is to the Soul, a Di&s;order which it has impro|perly lap&s;ed into. It is no Part of God's Creation, nor has any real Exi&s;tence by it&s;elf; but is the fallen, defective, di&s;tempered Con|dition of Beings, once created without Intem|perature, or Defect. Evil therefore, though it be in Man, is no con&s;tituent Part of Man, but an Imperfection adventitious to his Nature, which by an all-powerful Principle, he may
<PB N="18" REF="021391_0022_0FB36938C16B6B28">be recovered from, and his Nature re&s;tored to a State of Fitne&s;s for Union with his Maker. <HI>Secondly,</HI> uncreated Omnipotence is certainly more able to clean&s;e, than the creaturely, cor|rupt, and fallen Powers of Darkne&s;s are to defile; and Infinite Goodne&s;s mu&s;t be as willing and ready to effect the fir&s;t, as limited Envy the la&s;t. Did not the Sovereign Lord intend Man &s;hould be made Holy, he would not require it; nor would he require it without affording him the A&s;&s;i&s;tance requi&s;ite to accompli&s;h it, for he enjoins no Impo&s;&s;ibilities. That he doth require it, the &s;acred Writings &s;ufficiently wit|ne&s;s. "God,"<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 The&s;. iv. 7.</NOTE> &s;aith an apo&s;tolic Writer, <Q>hath not called us unto Uncleanne&s;s, <HI>but unto Holine&s;s.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. v. 25, &amp;c.</NOTE></Q> And, <Q>Chri&s;t al&s;o loved the Church, and gave him&s;elf for it, that he might &s;anctify and clean&s;e it, with the wa&s;h|ing of Water by the Word,</Q> (or the puri|fying Efficacy of the Holy Word, or Spirit, which clean&s;eth the Soul, as Water doth the Body) <Q>that he might pre&s;ent it to him&s;elf <HI>a glorious Church,</HI> not having Spot or Wrinkle, or any &s;uch Thing, but that <HI>it &s;hould be Holy and without blemi&s;h.</HI></Q> In another Place, he gives this Exhortation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 The&s;. v. 22.24.</NOTE> <Q>Ab&s;tain from all Appearance of Evil"&mdash;then proceeds&mdash; "And the very God of Peace <HI>&s;anctify you wholly,</HI> and I pray God, that your whole Spirit, and Soul, and Body, be <HI>pre&s;erved blamele&s;s</HI> unto the coming of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</Q> And to encourage them to &s;eek it and hope for it, he immediately a&s;&s;ures them, <Q>Faithful is he that calleth you, who al&s;o <HI>will do it.</HI></Q></P>

Contrary to this, the apo&s;tolic Doctrine is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. ii. 24.</NOTE> <Q>His own Self bore our Sins in his own Body on the Tree, that we being <HI>dead to Sin,</HI> &s;hould <HI>live unto Righteou&s;ne&s;s."</HI>&mdash;He <HI>died for all,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. v. 15.</NOTE> that they which live &s;hould <HI>not henceforth live unto them&s;elves,</HI> but unto him who died for them." &mdash;How &s;hall we that <HI>are dead to Sin live any longer therein?</HI>&mdash;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. vi. 2.12.21.22.</NOTE>"Let not Sin therefore reign in your mortal Body, that ye &s;hould obey it in the Lu&s;ts thereof."&mdash;"What Fruit had ye then in tho&s;e Things whereof ye are now a&s;hamed?

<P>It is true, the Apo&s;tle &s;aith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. x. 14.</NOTE> <Q>By one Offer|ing he hath perfected for ever them that are &s;anctified.</Q> But this doth not imply, that his Sacrifice perfected tho&s;e who never came to be &s;anctified.

5. It is always requi&s;ite that the Means be adequate to the End, the Cau&s;e &s;ufficient to the Effect; therefore, as all Men throughout all Nations, and every Generation, originally &s;tand in equal Relation to their Creator, have been, and mu&s;t naturally be, in ab&s;olute Need of his Help, in order to Purification and Sal|vation, the Means afforded for this Purpo&s;e mu&s;t be <HI>univer&s;al</HI> to reach all.

<P><HI>1.</HI> The Progeny of <HI>Adam</HI> not condemnable for his Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, but their own. <HI>2.</HI> The vital Part of Religion is internal, and may be experienced by People under every religious Denomination, and in every Part of the World &mdash;<HI>Pagans</HI> not nece&s;&s;arily excluded from all Share in Chri&s;t, and Chri&s;tianity; which, <HI>3,</HI> con&s;i&s;ts not e&s;&s;entially in Exteriors, or an imagery of Religion, but in being endued with a new Nature. <HI>4</HI> and <HI>5,</HI> This is certainly and &s;en&s;ibly to be known, through the Operation of Divine Grace. <HI>6.</HI> Chri&s;t waits to be gracious at the Door of every Man's Heart, cau&s;eth the Dead to hear his Voice, quickens the Ob&s;ervant, and renders them Partakers of his Heavenly Com|munion.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. HOWEVER publick a Per&s;on <HI>Adam</HI> may be accounted, and however his Po&s;terity might, without a Redeemer, have been by any thought chargeable with his Sin (though I am unable to conceive how any Man &s;hould de&s;erve Condemnation for what he could not help) yet our Saviour having paid the Price of our Redemption,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. ii. 9.</NOTE> <HI>by ta&s;ting Death for every Man,</HI> there cannot be any Thing chargeable to <HI>Adam</HI>'s De&s;cendants merely on Account of <HI>his
<PB N="25" REF="021391_0029_0FB3694AB3074B20">Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion,</HI> exclu&s;ive of <HI>their own. Original Sin</HI> therefore, in that Sen&s;e which implies <HI>Guilt in them for his Offence,</HI> I apprehend, has no Foundation in Truth. Nor, was it really &s;o, could any ceremonious Performance of Men, or even all the Water of <HI>Jordan</HI> wa&s;h it away. All exterior Forms, however mi&s;takenly exal|ted, or celebrated among&s;t Mankind, are but outward and vi&s;ible Signs, and altogether inef|fectual towards any real Change or Reformation of the Subject. And re&s;pecting little Children who are taken away before they have per&s;onally offended, they cannot in Equity be chargeable, but may with ju&s;t Con&s;idence be re&s;igned, as perfectly &s;afe in the Arms of their Saviour, who declared,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. xix. 14.</NOTE> "Of &s;uch is the Kingdom of Hea|ven;" and al&s;o told his Followers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid xviii. 3</NOTE> <Q><HI>except ye be converted,</HI> and become as little Children, ye &s;hall not enter into the Kingdom of Hea|ven.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. The vital Part of Man's Religion and Duty &s;tands, principally, in a right Attention to, and a faithful Obedience of the Manife&s;ta|tion of the Spirit of Chri&s;t in the Heart and Con&s;cience. He who pays due and con&s;tant Regard to this, is in his Mea&s;ure a Follower of Chri&s;t, and has, in &s;ome Degree, the Reality of Chri&s;tianity in him, live under what Mode of Profe&s;&s;ion, or in what Part of the World &s;oever he may. For who is a Servant of Chri&s;t but he that willingly obeys him? Is he who willingly acts according to his <HI>verbal Precepts,</HI> a Follower of Chri&s;t; and is not he who, without the Knowledge <HI>of the&s;e,</HI> with equal Willingne&s;s follows <HI>the Leadings of his Spirit,</HI> al&s;o his Servant? Of this Spirit the truly
<PB N="26" REF="021391_0030_0FB3694BE76DDF40">Virtuous and Religious among&s;t the Gentiles were,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. ii. 14, 15.</NOTE> in Degree, Partakers; "For," &s;aith Holy Writ, <Q>when the Gentiles which have not the Law, do by Nature the Things contained in the Law, the&s;e, having not the Law, are a Law unto them&s;elves; which &s;hew the Work of the Law written in their Hearts, their Con&s;cience al&s;o bearing Witne&s;s, and their Thoughts the mean While accu&s;ing or el&s;e excu&s;ing one another.</Q></P>
<P>The Words <HI>by Nature</HI> here, I apprehend, are not to be under&s;tood as if the Apo&s;tle intended the Gentiles became virtuous by any Goodne&s;s in <HI>their fallen Nature,</HI> which mu&s;t be the &s;ame as all other Mens. The Context &s;hews, he was here di&s;tingui&s;hing between tho&s;e who enjoyed the Mini&s;tration of the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Law, and tho&s;e who had it not; and he u&s;eth the Expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>by Nature,</HI> in the &s;ame Sen&s;e as if he had &s;aid, <HI>without an Education under the Law,</HI> and proceeds to &s;hew, that though they had it not, yet they practi&s;ed the Sub&s;tance intended by the Law. This &s;hewed not, that their own Hearts were their Law, but as the Apo&s;tle explains it, that <HI>the Work of the Law was written in their Hearts,</HI> and that they had a Part in the New Covenant, in Reference to which it is &s;aid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jer. xxxi. 33.</NOTE> <Q>I will put my Law in their inward Parts, and write it in their Hearts.</Q> Though they were without the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> they were not without Law to God. For, by receiving and retaining the Divine Impre&s;&s;ions in their Con&s;ciences, they were under the Law to Chri&s;t, or &s;ubject to the Manife&s;tation of his Spirit in their Hearts, and in Proportion to their Obedience, Partakers
<PB N="27" REF="021391_0031_0FB3694F0C4EECB8">of <HI>the Nature of the Divine Principle</HI> within them. By the internal Operation of <HI>this Nature</HI> it was that they became reformed in Heart, and rectified in Life and Practice, &s;o far as they were &s;o; or as the Text has it, enabled <Q>to do the Things contained in the Law.</Q> Originally di&s;ordered, and actually depraved, <HI>their own Nature</HI> as Men could never have led and em|powered them to this; for, &s;ince the primary Lap&s;e, <HI>it is prone to Evil,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. vii. 18.</NOTE> and true Reformation and Religion ari&s;e not from <HI>that di&s;ordered and corrupt Ground.</HI> They come not by Nature, but by Grace. They are the Fruit of that good Seed u<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">er&s;ally &s;own in every Heart, by the great and good Hu&s;bandman for that End. Were it not for the Notices and Powers com|municated by this internal Principle, Man mu&s;t have continued to proceed in the Increa&s;e of Corruption, Irreligion and Mi&s;ery; as appears too evidently by the Conduct of &s;uch as di&s;re|gard it. Not by following <HI>their own Nature</HI> therefore, but by Obedience to the inward Law of <HI>the Divine Nature</HI> written in the Heart, the con&s;cientiou&s;ly Virtuous among&s;t the Gentiles, as well as others, were enabled to perform the Things, or <HI>ju&s;t Morals</HI> contained in the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Law, and thereby to evidence in their Mea&s;ures, the effectual Operation and Authority of the Divine Lawgiver within them.</P>
<P>The Gentiles therefore partaking of the Law written in the Heart, cannot properly be &s;aid to be excluded from all Share in the New Covenant, or Di&s;pen&s;ation of the Go&s;pel. The Go&s;pel, taken in its full Extent, is the Reve|lation of the Love and Mercy, and the Offer and Operation of the Grace of God, through
<PB N="28" REF="021391_0032_0FB3695239405388">Chri&s;t, to fallen Man in his natural and cor|ruptible State, in order to his Re&s;toration and Salvation. It is not wholly contracted into the <HI>more Tidings;</HI> but, including the&s;e, goes deeper, and <HI>e&s;&s;entially</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in the Thing declared by them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid i. 16.</NOTE> <HI>the Power of God admini&s;|tered to the Salvation of the Soul.</HI> By this the outward Coming of Chri&s;t is rendered truly and fully effectual to each Individual. Tho&s;e who believe in, and obey him in his inward and &s;piritual Manife&s;tations, by which the Go&s;pel is preached in every rational Creature under Heaven, may come to be Partakers of his Life, and be &s;aved by him from the &s;econd Death of eternal Mi&s;ery, though providentially incapacitated to know the exterior Hi&s;tory of his Incarnation, &amp;c.</P>
<P>That virtuous and devout Gentiles were approved of God, appears in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Cor|nelius,</HI> for we find that before his Reception of hi&s;torical and verbal Chri&s;tianity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts x. 2, 3, 4.</NOTE> his &s;incere Devotion, and Reverence towards his Creator, and charitable Acts to the Needy, <Q>came up for a Memorial before God,</Q> who al&s;o now taught <HI>Peter,</HI> Ver&s;e 15, the Gentiles he had thus clean&s;ed were no more to be e&s;teemed <HI>common</HI> or <HI>unclean</HI> than the believing <HI>Jews,</HI> and gave him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ibid 34, 35.</NOTE> <HI>of a Truth,</HI> to perceive, <Q>that <HI>God is no Re&s;pecter of Per&s;ons:</HI> but in every Nation, he that &s;eareth him, and worketh Righteou&s;ne&s;s, is accepted with him.</Q></P>
<P>Hence it appears, tho&s;e who con&s;cientiou&s;ly obey the &s;piritual Manife&s;tations of Chri&s;t in them, are internally, though not by outward Profe&s;&s;ion, his Di&s;ciples and Followers, and truly believe in him &s;o far as he is revealed to
<PB N="29" REF="021391_0033_0FB36955234E77A8">them; for Obedience is the certain Proof of a right Faith. And I make no Que&s;tion, but tho&s;e in any Part of the Globe, who, from invincible Ob&s;tacles, have not the Opportunity of hi&s;torical Chri&s;tianity, in their Obedience to the &s;piritual Appearance of Chri&s;t in their Hearts, are accepted, and partake of the Bene|fits of his Death. Why &s;hould they not be as capable of receiving Advantage by the Sacri|fice of Chri&s;t, as Di&s;advantage by the Fall of <HI>Adam,</HI> whil&s;t they are equally Strangers to the Hi&s;tory of both? But certainly, tho&s;e to whom the &s;acred Writings are providentially com|municated, are under double Obligation, &s;ince they are favoured with that additional in&s;tru|mental Advantage; and it will tend to their greater Condemnation, if they believe not unto Obedience. For, however high the Profe&s;&s;ion of &s;uch may be, they are but imperfect, &s;uper|ficial, ineffectual Believers, who hold with the external Part, and experience not the internal: Chri&s;tians <HI>in Name,</HI> but <HI>not in Deed</HI> and <HI>in Truth.</HI> It is e&s;&s;ential to us who have the Scrip|tures, to believe both in the outward Coming, and inward Mini&s;tration of our Saviour, re&s;ign|ing to him, and tru&s;ting in him, with that Faith of the Operation of God, which works by Love to the Purification of the Heart, and is the &s;aving Faith of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Complete Chri&s;tianity has both an In&s;ide and an Out&s;ide; a Profe&s;&s;ion or bodily Appearance, and a Life and Virtue, which is as a Soul to that Body. Tho&s;e who are in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of both, are complete Chri&s;tians. Tho&s;e who have the inward Part without the outward, though incomplete in that Re&s;pect, will, in
<PB N="30" REF="021391_0034_0FB36957228C1DC0">the Sight of perfect Equity, certainly be pre|ferred to &s;uch as have the latter without the former; and it would be well for all who have the Hi&s;tory, and profe&s;s the Chri&s;tian Religion, yet walk contrary to its Requirings, could they change Conditions at la&s;t with &s;uch con&s;cien|tious Gentiles. Let tho&s;e who are &s;o deeply affected with Ab&s;urdity, as to believe or ima|gine, that Infinite Wi&s;dom, Goodne&s;s and Equity, has confined Salvation to &s;uch of his Creatures as happen, without any Choice of their own, to inhabit particular Spots of the Globe, are formalized after a peculiar Manner, or entertain one particular Set of Articles and Opinions, let &s;uch duly con&s;ider the following Texts.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. viii. 10, 11, 12.</NOTE> <Q>Verily I &s;ay unto you, I have not found &s;o great Faith, no not in <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> and I &s;ay unto you, That many &s;hall come from the Ea&s;t and We&s;t, and &s;hall &s;it down with <HI>Abraham,</HI> and <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> in the Kingdom of Heaven; but the Children of the Kingdom" (by Education merely) "&s;hall be ca&s;t out into utter Darkne&s;s; there &s;hall be weeping and gna&s;hing of Teeth."<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. vii. 9, 10.</NOTE> "After this I beheld, and lo, a great Multitude, which no Man could number, <HI>of all Nations, and Kindreds, and People, and Tongues,</HI> &s;tood before the Throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white Robes, and Palms in their Hands; and cried with a loud Voice, &s;aying, Salvation to our God, who &s;itteth upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb!</Q></P>
<P N="3">3. Real Chri&s;tianity con&s;i&s;ts not in the Pro|fe&s;&s;ion of any framed Articles of Belief, nor in the Practice of Signs and Ceremonies, however di&s;played with exterior Pomp, or whatever

<P N="4">4. The New Birth is not brought forth in Particulars imperceptibly. The New Man is renewed <HI>in Knowledge;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. iii. 10.</NOTE> in a certain and &s;en&s;ible Experience.

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. MANKIND are not left to Satan, nor to their own Lu&s;ts, nor to live without God in the World. A Way is ca&s;t up. A Means is provided. Be&s;ides the natu|ral, and traditional Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of mere moral Good and Evil in every Brea&s;t, God hath a Divine Witne&s;s in the Heart of each Individual, which will truly manife&s;t Right and Wrong in the Con&s;ciences of tho&s;e who faithfully attend thereunto, afford Light and Power to &s;et them free from the Mi&s;ts of Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and Preju|dice, and become to them a &s;afe Conductor, and an able Supporter in the Paths of Religion and Virtue.</P>
<P>What In&s;tructor can we have equal to this mo&s;t intimate Witne&s;s? A Monitor &s;o near, &s;o con&s;tant, &s;o faithful, &s;o infallible! This is the
<PB N="36" REF="021391_0040_0FB3696562EDBA08">great Go&s;pel-privilege of every Man: The Advantage of having it preached Day by Day in his own Heart, without Money, and with|out Price, yet with Certainty. Is it rea&s;onable to conclude, this nice, true, and awful Di&s;|cerner, &s;hould be le&s;s than Divine? Can any Per&s;on, upon &s;erious Con&s;ideration, imagine it to be the Nature of the fallen Man him&s;elf? Is there the lea&s;t Probability that any Thing &s;o corrupted and clouded, &s;hould &s;o clearly and in&s;tantly di&s;tingui&s;h, and would the Heart of Man, which is declared by In&s;piration to be <HI>deceitful above all Things,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jer. xvii. 9.</NOTE> and de&s;perately wicked,</HI> &s;o faithfully reprove it&s;elf? Would that which delights in its own Indulgence, and is impatient of Re&s;traint, act in daily Control to its own Inclinations? Is it the Property of Evil to do Good? Here is a ju&s;t Criterion. That which is natural, leads according to Na|ture; that which is &s;piritual according to the Spirit. The&s;e are di&s;tingui&s;hed in Scripture by the Terms <HI>Fle&s;h</HI> and <HI>Spirit,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. vii. 23.</NOTE> and are truly &s;aid to war again&s;t each other in Man.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. v. 17.</NOTE> As Sin wars again&s;t the Spirit to de&s;troy the Soul, the Spirit wars again&s;t Sin to &s;ave the Soul.</P>
<P>Let me query with you, who, in&s;tead of embracing in Humility, Love, and Thankful|ne&s;s, this upright Principle <HI>as Divine,</HI> are exerting your Abilities to depreciate and revile it. Whil&s;t you confe&s;s it di&s;tingui&s;hes Right from Wrong in your own Brea&s;ts, by its Appro|bation of the fir&s;t, and rebuke of the la&s;t; can you thus acknowledge it to be infallibly Good, and at the &s;ame Time attribute it to your&s;elves? "I know,"<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. vii. 18.</NOTE> &s;aith <HI>Paul,</HI> <Q>that in me, that is in my Fle&s;h,"(or belonging to my Nature)

Is there <HI>any</HI> good Thing in yours, yet was there <HI>none</HI> in his? He confe&s;&s;ed he had none as Man. I pre|&s;ume you have no more than he had. Whence then this quick and righteous Di&s;criminator appearing in your Con&s;ciences? You will not &s;ay, it is of Satan; it mu&s;t therefore either be of Man, or of God.

Pride was the Cau&s;e of the Degeneracy of Angels, and its natural Con&s;equence is the De&s;truction of Peace and Felicity to all that entertain it. By being &s;omething in our own Conceit, attributing any Good to our&s;elves, or a&s;piring above our Place and due Order, we center in Pride and Arro|gance. Created Beings may be guilty of this; but it is impo&s;&s;ible to that all-perfect Exi&s;tence, who is Infinite, Omnipotent, and Immutable.</P>
<P>This vi&s;ible World demon&s;trates, it was made by an Omnipotent Power, and is pre&s;erved by the &s;ame Power. Without Power it could not be made, and as <HI>Tho. Sherlock</HI> ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, <Q>That which owes its very Being to Power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;cour&s;e on Provi|dence.</NOTE> mu&s;t depend upon the Power that made it, for it can have no Principle of Self-&s;ub|&s;i&s;tence independent on its Cau&s;e.</Q> What doth not nece&s;&s;arily exi&s;t, mu&s;t both be origi|nally created, and continually upheld by the
<PB N="41" REF="021391_0045_0FB369721F6A7718">Power, that made it. It had no Being before its Creation. It cannot retain its Being again&s;t the Will of its Creator. Its Exi&s;tence and Sup|port &s;tand equally in the Power of its Maker, without whom it was nothing, could never have exi&s;ted, nor can continue in Exi&s;tence. It was made by his Power, is pre&s;erved by his Power, and upon the Withdrawment of his Power would di&s;&s;olve and evani&s;h into its origi|nal Nothing. There is no Medium between Self-exi&s;tence and Dependence on its Cau&s;e; therefore a Ce&s;&s;ation from it of the Power that made it, is Annihilation to it. Thus, as all created Things were made, and &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t &s;oley by the Energy of the Creator's Will and Power, he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, whil&s;t they exi&s;t, be omni-pre&s;ent with them, in them, and thro' them; therefore cannot be ignorant of any Thing relating to them, nor unconcerned about them, or any Part of them.</P>
<P>The continual Interpo&s;ition and Superin|tendence of the Spirit of God, was always requi&s;ite to Man, both to pre&s;erve him whil&s;t in Innocence, and to recover him from under his fallen E&s;tate, by governing the Effects of natural Cau&s;es; and to counteract the Wiles, and oppo&s;e the Influences of the evil Spirit. Therefore the great Mediator for, and Redeemer of Men, was from the Beginning, not only incarnately and corporeally given for a Propi|tiation for the Sins of the whole World, to be te&s;tified, or verified, in due Time; but he was al&s;o as univer&s;ally given, in a &s;piritual Manner, to be <HI>a Witne&s;s, a Leader,</HI> and <HI>Commander.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">I&s;a. lv. 4.</NOTE> 1.

<P>In the Pa&s;&s;ages above cited from <HI>Rom.</HI> vii. and viii. the experienced Apo&s;tle evidently includes a Repre&s;entation of three very different Conditions, in their Cour&s;e of Progre&s;&s;ion, and State of Di&s;parity from each other. Fir&s;t, a natural blind unconvicted State; which is that of Darkne&s;s and Death, an&s;wering to the origi|nal Chaos before Light was brought forth. Second, a State of Illumination and Di&s;co|very, of Conviction and internal Warfare, in order to a complete Conver&s;ion; which partakes of a Mixture, and &s;hews Light and Darkne&s;s in the Act of Separation, like that in <HI>Gen.</HI> i. 3, 4, 5. Third, a State of Redemption from the Power of Sin, through Purification, and a Tran&s;lation into the &s;piritual Kingdom of Chri&s;t; which is the State of the perfect Chri&s;|tian, and completes the new Creation, wherein every Thing takes its due Place, and moves in its proper Order. I now refer it to the intel|ligent Reader, whether it is not an Ab&s;urdity to imagine, that the&s;e three diver&s;e, and in &s;ome Re&s;pects contrary States &s;hould all &s;ub&s;i&s;t together, at the &s;ame Time, in the &s;ame Subject.</P>
<P>By this Repre&s;entation, which contains a brief and comprehen&s;ive Delineation of the Work of the New-birth, the Apo&s;tle &s;hews to &s;uch as are young in the Faith, what different States they have to pa&s;s through in that prepa|ratory Travel, and al&s;o reminds the Regenerate
<PB N="49" REF="021391_0053_0FB3698670408A00">of what they have witne&s;&s;ed, in the Lines of his own Experience. He de&s;cribes the various Steps, and principal Leadings of the Holy Spirit, till by its effectual Operation, the Soul is rendered a new Creature, and introduced into the Kingdom of God; which being inward and &s;piritual, is entered by an inward and &s;piritual Way. Hence it is clear, a Man may acquire all the Learning, and receive all the Degrees that Schools and Colleges can be&s;tow, with all the Authority Men can afford him, and may be &s;trict in the Practice of all the Forms and Exteriors of Religion; and yet remain <HI>the natural Man</HI> &s;till. The&s;e can bring him no nearer to true Regeneration, than he was the Moment of his Birth; for the New|birth is the Work of the Holy Spirit only. Nothing but the Spirit of Holine&s;s can make a Man Holy; for nothing can communicate what it hath not. Nothing can &s;et Men free from the Power of Sin, and its Wages, Death, but the Law, or Power, of the Spirit of Life in Chri&s;t Je&s;us individually admini&s;tered.

But the fir&s;t may more than unprofitably bu&s;y their Practi|&s;ers, if they are &s;o dangerou&s;ly deceived, as to place Confidence either in their own Perform|ances, or tho&s;e of their Leaders. The Religion of the true Chri&s;tian con&s;i&s;teth not in Form, but Sub&s;tance, and ari&s;eth not from the Activity of human Rea&s;on, Imagination, or Opinion, but from an Heart-felt Sen&s;ation of Divine Love in the Light of Life.

<P>This <HI>Life of God</HI> in Chri&s;t, is the very Soul of Chri&s;tianity; without which the be&s;t Forms and highe&s;t Profe&s;&s;ions are but as Members of a dead Body, unavailable and unacceptable. <Q>He that hath the Son <HI>hath Life,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 John v. 12.</NOTE> and he that hath not the Son of God <HI>hath not Life."</HI> Becau&s;e I live,"<NOTE PLACE="marg">John xiv. 19, 20.</NOTE> &s;aith he, "ye &s;hall live al&s;o. <HI>At that Day, ye &s;hall know,</HI> that I am in my Father, and <HI>you in me,</HI> and <HI>I in you.</HI></Q> It is becau&s;e he lives in, and communicates of his Life to his &s;piritual Followers, that they live al&s;o.

<P N="3">3. We are all by Nature Strangers to this Divine Life, and we cannot, by any Means, obtain it for our&s;elves. It is not of Man's Acquirement, but God's Communication; and as far out of the Reach of the mo&s;t Learned, as of the mo&s;t Illiterate. It is hid from the Wi&s;e and Prudent (in their own Eyes) and re|vealed to tho&s;e who are as Babes (to the World's Wi&s;dom.) It is not the high Learned, but the Humble that God teaches, and the Meek that he guides in the Paths of Truth and Judgment. Every one's Eye therefore ought to be humbly to God alone, and not to be fixed upon the Wi&s;e, the Scribe, the Di&s;puter of this World; for <HI>God hath,</HI> by the powerful Simplicity and Purity of his Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. i. 20.</NOTE> <HI>made fooli&s;h the Wi&s;dom of this World.</HI> Yet &s;o fond is the World of <HI>its own Wi&s;dom,</HI> that it has in great Mea&s;ure detruded the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, and true &s;piritual Religion, and erected and &s;upported <HI>this Idol</HI> in its Room.

<P N="4">4. From a due Con&s;ideration of the deba&s;ed and corrupt State of Mankind, &s;ince the Fall, and of the great and good End of their Creation, it mu&s;t evidently appear, that Regeneration hath ever been the <HI>one Thing needful;</HI> a Work e&s;&s;en|tial for all to experience. And as the Birth of the Spirit cannot be brought forth by any Thing but the Spirit, &s;o it mu&s;t al&s;o be pre|&s;erved in its Growth and Accompli&s;hment by the Spirit. Hence the abiding, or indwelling of the Spirit, remains to be of ab&s;olute Nece&s;|&s;ity to the Regenerate, that as their Souls are quickened into the Divine Life by it, they may continue to live, move, and have their Being as Chri&s;tians therein, and be &s;u&s;tained in a &s;piritual Union, and ble&s;&s;ed Communion with their Maker.</P>
<P N="5">5. The E&s;&s;entiality of true Religion hath ever been the &s;ame, primarily con&s;i&s;ting in the Life of God being rai&s;ed up, and the Love of God &s;hed abroad in the Heart, operating therein to its Renovation, and to every virtuous and benevolent End. Whatever of Externals or Ceremonials have, at &s;undry Times, been &s;uper-added by Divine Direction or Command, were not intended to alter, or un&s;ettle Men from due and con&s;tant Attention to <HI>vital &s;piritual Religion;</HI> but when they were become greatly degenerated from it, and darkened concerning it, the mer|ciful Creator was plea&s;ed, by Means &s;uited to their e&s;tranged and carnal Condition, to point it out to them, and lead them by Signs and Symbols towards it. Thus the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Law
<PB N="61" REF="021391_0065_0FB369A750A1B0C0">was not meant to be the Whole of Religion to the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. iii. 24.</NOTE> or to &s;upercede the internal Reli|gion of Grace; but only to be as <HI>a Schoolma&s;ter to bring them to Chri&s;t</HI> in Spirit, in whom all is included and fulfilled, and who&s;e Pre&s;ence was then with the Faithful among&s;t them, who had &s;piritual Communion with him; for, according to Scripture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. x. 3, 4.</NOTE> <Q>They did all eat the &s;ame &s;piritual Meat, and did all drink the &s;ame &s;piritual Drink; for they drank of that &s;piritual Rock that followed them; and <HI>that Rock was Chri&s;t.</HI></Q></P>
<P>It is a vain Thing to imagine, that Reli|gion ever wholly con&s;i&s;ted in Mode or Form; or that the All-perfect Lord at any Time di&s;|pen&s;ed with the Sub&s;tance for the Sake of the Shadow; or ever made any Alteration therein, by Diver&s;ity of In&s;titutions, from arbitrary Will and Plea&s;ure, merely to exerci&s;e his Sove|reignty, as though Power was a darling Attri|bute, and more regarded by him than Wi&s;dom, Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and Goodne&s;s; or as though his Attributes could be divided in him. No; he is God, and changeth not. His Law is <HI>his own Spirit of eternal Rectitude,</HI> and his Retri|bution according to every Man's State and Works. The different Modifications that have appeared among&s;t Men in Point of Religion, have been occa&s;ioned by the different Altera|tions in the Conditions of Mankind. The All-wi&s;e God hath directed &s;ome for a Time, in Conde&s;cen&s;ion, for the good End above|mentioned; and divers Combinations of Men have invented and enjoined Abundance more, according to their own carnal Mi&s;apprehen&s;ions

It derives its Origin from Heaven, and leads to Heaven. It carries the Soul out of all Formalities and fal&s;e Re&s;ts, up to the Supreme Good him&s;elf. It breaks down all our own Self-will, and brings into perfect Re&s;ignation to the Divine Will. In this humble contrited Frame, and no other, can we &s;incerely and truly &s;ay, <HI>Thy Kingdom come!

<P N="6">6. The Pride of Man is naturally aver&s;e to this aba&s;ed and broken Situation. It knows not how to &s;ubmit to be, or to think it&s;elf, <HI>nothing;</HI> though it is wor&s;e than nothing. It would fain erect and plume it&s;elf upon &s;ome Impor|tance, &s;ome E&s;timation, or De&s;erving of its own; yet all its Pretences to <HI>Merit</HI> are fal&s;e and vain. Man being nothing as &s;uch, but what God has made him, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing nothing but
<PB N="63" REF="021391_0067_0FB369AA84F06398">what he affords him, is wholly God's, and not his own, and is therefore in Duty bound to walk in Obedience to him, every Moment of his Life, which is given him for that End. And &s;eeing Man has fallen &s;hort of his Duty, and hath &s;inned again&s;t his Sovereign by Di&s;o|bedience, it is neither in his Power, by any Thing he can perform, to merit Heaven, nor to purcha&s;e Remi&s;&s;ion for him&s;elf.

To the Willing and Obedient, to him who is faithful unto Death, to him that over|cometh, through Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance, are the Promi&s;es of eternal Life.

<P N="7">7. The Laws and Requi&s;itions of God to Man, are in Scripture often &s;tiled <HI>Covenants.</HI> Not meaning that Man has per&s;onally bound him&s;elf, on his Part to perform the Conditions, but that he is really in Duty as deeply obliged, and as firmly bound to do the Will of his Creator, as if he had voluntarily bound him&s;elf in the &s;tronge&s;t Obligations po&s;&s;ible.

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. RELIGION here, and Salvation hereafter, are as much the Concern and Duty of the Illiterate and Ignorant, as of the Wi&s;e and Learned. And as tho&s;e are by much the greater Number, religious Duty mu&s;t undoubtedly con&s;i&s;t in &s;omething equally attainable and practicable by all; for God is no Re&s;pecter of Per&s;ons. It cannot lie e&s;&s;en|tially in literal Knowledge, nor in any peculiar Mode of Education; for the&s;e are the Lot of few, in Compari&s;on of the whole of Mankind. Happine&s;s being the End of Man's Creation, and the univer&s;al indi&s;pen&s;able Concern of every Man, the effective Means of Regeneration and Salvation mu&s;t be attainable by every Man.
<PB N="66" REF="021391_0070_0FB369B440938D70">Nothing but the Omnipre&s;ent, and All-effec|tive Spirit of God can be this Means; for nothing el&s;e is univer&s;al, nor any Way adequate to the Work. The Spirit of God therefore, being nece&s;&s;ary to every Man, is afforded to every Man, by him who with-holds nothing nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>This Holy operative Spirit, <HI>Solomon,</HI> under its Influence, with great Propriety, &s;tiles <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> and repre&s;ents it, in familiar Language, as calling upon Mankind, <HI>to turn at its Reproofs,</HI> with a Promi&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. i.</NOTE> to <HI>pour out its Spirit unto them.</HI> He al&s;o impleads tho&s;e as <HI>Fools</HI> who reject or &s;light its Reproofs, or Convictions in their Con&s;ciences;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ver&s;e 20, 21.</NOTE> by which he &s;hews, <HI>it accompa|nies them even in the Streets and Places of Concour&s;e.</HI> Recounting the great Works of this Spirit of Wi&s;dom, he el&s;ewhere te&s;tifies, <Q>She pre&s;erved the fir&s;t formed Father of the World,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wi&s;d. x. 1.</NOTE> that was created alone, and brought him out of his Fall.</Q> She was not only his <HI>Pre&s;erver</HI> before his Fall, but his Requickener and Re&s;torer out of that Death, he through Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion fell into; and &s;eeing the whole rational Progeny of <HI>Adam</HI> are naturally under the like Nece&s;&s;ity of being born of the Spirit, its Admini&s;tration is offered to all, in due Degrees, and every Individual in all Ages, who have experienced the New-birth, by which right Reformation is wrought, have known it to be effected by the Operation of the Spirit. This the wi&s;e Author above-cited witne&s;&s;eth, in his Acknowledgment to Almighty Good|ne&s;s, when he &s;aith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wi&s;d. ix. 17, 18.</NOTE> <Q>Thy Council who hath known, except thou give <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> and <HI>&s;end thy Holy Spirit from above?</HI> For <HI>&s;o</HI> the

<P N="2">Evident Tokens of internal Religion, and the <HI>immediate Manife&s;tations</HI> of the Spirit for that End, appear throughout both the Old Te&s;|tament and the New. Before the Flood, the old World was favoured with the Manife&s;tation of the Holy Spirit, as it is implied <HI>Gen.</HI> vi. 3. My Spirit &s;hall not always &s;trive with," or rather <HI>in,</HI> "Man." For &s;o <HI>Hebreans</HI> &s;ay it ought to be rendered. And indeed, where could the Spirit &s;o properly &s;trive as in the Soul of Man, where the Seat of Corruption is, and to which the Sugge&s;tions of Evil are applied? And to what End &s;hould it &s;trive with them, but to bring them to Repentance and Refor|mation, and to become, through their Obe|dience, the Kingdom, or ruling Power of God in them.</P>
<P>Renovation of Heart by the Holy Spirit, and its genuine Fruits of Repentance towards God, Faith in him, and Obedience to him, was the principal and e&s;&s;ential Part of Religion al&s;o among the <HI>I&s;raelites. Deut.</HI> xxx. 10. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> repre&s;ents the Conditions on the Perfor|mance of which they &s;hould be entitled to the Promi&s;es. <Q>If thou &s;halt hearken unto the Voice of the Lord thy God, to keep his Commandments and his Statutes, which are written in this Book of the Law, and if thou turn unto the Lord thy God, with all thine Heart, and with all thy Soul.</Q> The&s;e are the Terms; fir&s;t, that they &s;hould keep the Law; this was the external and legal Part
<PB N="68" REF="021391_0072_0FB369B720BB2E50">of their Duty. Second, that <HI>they &s;hould turn their whole Hearts and Souls to God;</HI> this was the internal and evangelical Part. He leaves them not here in a State of Uncertainty, but proceeds to &s;hew them to what their inward Attention &s;hould be turned.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ver&s;e 11, &amp;c.</NOTE> "For," &s;aith he, <Q>this Commandment which I command thee this Day,</Q> (or this which I command thee to turn thine Heart unto) <Q>is <HI>not hidden from thee,</HI> neither is it far off. It is not in Heaven that thou &s;hould&s;t &s;ay, who &s;hall go up for us to Heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it and do it? Neither is it beyond the Sea, that thou &s;hould&s;t &s;ay, who &s;hall go over the Sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it and do it? But the <HI>Word is very nigh unto thee,</HI> in thy Mouth, and in thy Heart, that thou may&s;t do it.</Q> The Apo&s;tle a&s;&s;umes and explains this Pa&s;&s;age, <HI>Rom.</HI> x. 6, 7, 8. <Q>The Righteou&s;ne&s;s <HI>which is of Faith,</HI> &s;peaketh on this wi&s;e, Say not in thine Heart, who &s;hall a&s;cend into Heaven?</Q> (that is to bring <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> down from above.) <Q>Or, who &s;hall de&s;cend into the Deep?</Q> (that is to bring up <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> again from the Dead) <Q>But what &s;aith it? The <HI>Word</HI> is nigh thee, even in thy Mouth, and in thy Heart. <HI>That is the Word of Faith which we preach.</HI></Q></P>
<P>By this Explanation of the Apo&s;tle, it appears, 1&s;t, That be&s;ides the Law, <HI>Mo&s;es then</HI> preached to <HI>I&s;rael the &s;ame Words of Faith,</HI> which him&s;elf, and his evangelical Brethren did. 2d, That <HI>this Word is Chri&s;t</HI> in Spirit, calling for Attention and Obedience in the Heart, or Con&s;cience, of Man, in order to effect his Re&s;toration and Salvation. 3d, This
<PB N="69" REF="021391_0073_0FB369BD84C9DC50">is not a local, or temporary, but anward Vi&s;itation of the Saviour of Mankind, by his Spirit in the Heart.</P>
<P>The Word of Faith is the Word of Truth, the Word of the everla&s;ting Go&s;pel; and not a Compo&s;ition of Letters. The Term <HI>Word,</HI> like many other Words, is u&s;ed in various Sen&s;es; as a Speech or Saying, an Engagement, a Report, a Command, an Exhortation, an In&s;truction, &amp;c. becau&s;e the&s;e are compo&s;ed of Words. And as Men u&s;e to convey <HI>their Sen&s;e</HI> to one another by Words, &s;o God conveys <HI>his</HI> to Men by Chri&s;t, who is peculiarly and empha|tically &s;tiled in Scripture, the <HI>Word of God;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">John i. and Rev. xix. 13.</NOTE> and as the Way Men receive Words from the Mouths of one another is by <HI>hearing,</HI> &s;o the Manner by which the Soul receives internal In&s;truction, Reproof, &amp;c. from the Holy Spirit, is metaphorically called <HI>Hearing.</HI> Thus Faith, which is <HI>the Gift of God,</HI> is &s;aid to come by <HI>hearing,</HI> and <HI>hearing</HI> by <HI>the Word of God.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. x. 17</NOTE> That is, I apprehend, the <HI>internal Sen&s;e</HI> it&s;elf is opened in the Soul, as well as <HI>Subjects</HI> com|municated, by the Spirit of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence we &s;ee, the <HI>Divine Legation</HI> to the <HI>Jews,</HI> con&s;i&s;ted not in the outward written Law only. Nor were they kept in Ignorance of inward &s;piritual Religion, or of a future State of Rewards and Puni&s;hments. For, if &s;o, to what Purpo&s;e did <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> pre&s;s the Con&s;idera|tion of their latter End upon them, with &s;o much Fervency? <Q>O that they were wi&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deut. xxxii. 29.</NOTE> that they under&s;tood this, that they would con&s;ider their <HI>latter End.</HI></Q> What material Con&s;ideration &s;hould their latter End, or Time of Death, be of, to &s;uch as know no better
<PB N="70" REF="021391_0074_0FB369C054070788">but that it would be the Period of their Exi&s;|tence? Or why &s;hould he <HI>command</HI> their Attention to the <HI>living Word of Faith, Chri&s;t</HI> in the Heart, as well as to the written Code? He was an eminently in&s;pired Prophet, and well knew that Salvation is <HI>by Chri&s;t alone;</HI> and that his inward &s;piritual Law, is as preferable to the exterior one, as the Sub&s;tance is to the Shadow. Obedience to the outward temporal Law, had outward and temporal Promi&s;es; but Obedience to the inward &s;piritual Law, hath Promi&s;es of an internal and eternal Nature. By the Works of the fir&s;t, no Man could be ju&s;tified; but by the Operation of the la&s;t, Sanctification is wrought, and Salvation expe|rienced. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was a Type of Chri&s;t, and the temporal Law, with its temporal Rewards, a Type of the Law of the Spirit of Life in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and its eternal Recompence.</P>
<P N="4">4. But it may be queried; if the &s;piritual Law was always afforded, what Occa&s;ion was there for the Addition of temporal Statutes? An&s;w. The <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> by living under Servi|tude to a mo&s;t &s;uper&s;titious and idolatrous People, were become prone to Super&s;tition and Idolatry them&s;elves.<NOTE PLACE="marg">P&s;al. evi. 35, 36.</NOTE> "They were mingled among the Heathen," &s;aith the P&s;almi&s;t, <Q>and learned their Works; and they &s;erved their Idols, which were a Snare unto them.</Q> Out of this Idolatry they were to be brought, and by their Obedience to the only true God, were to become an Example to the Nations round them, to influence their Return likewi&s;e. Tho' all had the Word nigh in the Heart, yet having lo&s;t the right Sen&s;e of what it is, the Law was
<PB N="71" REF="021391_0075_0FB369C1A1F40828">added <HI>becau&s;e of their Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion</HI> and Cor|ruption till the coming of Chri&s;t in the Fle&s;h.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. iii. 19.</NOTE></P>
<P>Seeing their habitual Attachment to the Forms and Super&s;titions of <HI>Pagani&s;m,</HI> was too &s;trong to admit of their being willingly and clearly brought out of them at once, Divine Wi&s;dom conde&s;cended to meet them in the State they were in, and to proceed gradually with them, by allowing them &s;ome Forms and Ceremonies like to tho&s;e they had been inured to; but more regular and &s;ignificant. The Supreme Lord of the Univer&s;e fir&s;t ob&s;erves to them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exod. xx.</NOTE> <Q>I am the Lord thy God which have brought thee out of the Land of <HI>Egypt,</HI> out of the Hou&s;e of Bondage;</Q> and then commands, <Q>Thou &s;halt have no other Gods before me.</Q> Thus he draws their Atten|tion off from the Idols of the Heathen, and places it wholly upon him&s;elf, as the &s;ole Object of their Adoration and Obedience. And to give one In&s;tance for all, as the Heathens, who&s;e Manners they had imbibed, were accu&s;|tomed to &s;wear by their fal&s;e Gods, he did not &s;ee fit to prohibit all &s;olemn Oaths at once, but confined them to &s;wear by him&s;elf alone, exclu&s;ive of the <HI>Pagan</HI> Idols; not requiring the perfect Practice of the Chri&s;tian Precept, <HI>Swear not at all, neither by Heaven, nor by the Earth, nor by any other Oath,</HI> of them, whil&s;t not in a Chri&s;tian State, nor under its clear Di&s;pen&s;ation; but only entering them into the Path appointed for them towards it, and to prepare the Way for its E&s;tabli&s;hment. Thus he made the Law a temporary Expedient, to bring them gradually towards the Practice of that perfect Religion, he intended in due Sea&s;on
<PB N="72" REF="021391_0076_0FB369C3272D2108">to introduce, and to &s;et up in its Purity, for all Men to come into, and to walk in.</P>

<P>I do not apprehend, that the My&s;tery of Godline&s;s, and its internal Life and Virtue, was ever intended by Divine Wi&s;dom to be concealed from Mankind; but was always held forth, though &s;ometimes ob&s;curely under typi|cal Forms, on Account of the Numbers of degenerate Minds, who were too much prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed and darkened, to behold the Splendor of the Go&s;pel in its clear Manife&s;tation.

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. AFTER the Wonders of Creation and Providence were di&s;played, in pro|ducing and e&s;tabli&s;hing the &s;tupendous Sy&s;tem of external Nature, its great Author was plea&s;ed, at di&s;tant Periods, to &s;hew forth the vi&s;ible Effects of his miraculous Power among&s;t the Sons of Men; but when the Time came wherein he &s;aw fit to recal the degenerate World from the Corruptions it was immer&s;ed in, by a public A&s;&s;umption and Manife&s;tation of his own ju&s;t Dominion among&s;t a People <HI>cho&s;en</HI> for that Purpo&s;e, he rai&s;ed up the Chil|dren of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> as an Exemplar to the re&s;t of Mankind. He brought them out of their <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Bondage by an high Hand, and through many admirable Strokes of his Power; and upon his In&s;titution of the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Law, which being the Introduction of a new Form of <HI>Theocracy,</HI> unknown to the World, it was requi&s;ite it &s;hould be attended by &s;uch extraor|dinary Marks of Divine Authority, as might
<PB N="81" REF="021391_0083_0FB369D5E5855CA8">be &s;ufficient to authenticate and inforce it, as coming from him&s;elf. He therefore, on that great Occa&s;ion, appeared to the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> in a Manner an&s;werable to his Almighty Sove|reignty; and al&s;o to the Nature and Solemnity of that Law; which being a Mini&s;tration of Condemnation, was u&s;hered in by the mo&s;t dreadful and a&s;toni&s;hing Tokens of Terror; with Thundrings and Lightnings, Blackne&s;s, Darkne&s;s, and Tempe&s;t, the Mountain flaming with Fire, the alarming Sound of the Trumpet, waxing louder and louder, and the Voice of Words &s;o terrible, that not only the People, but the whole Mountain quaked exceedingly. This being an obvious, and mo&s;t &s;olemn Act of the &s;upreme Legi&s;lator of the Univer&s;e, no le&s;s Authority than his own, could either aboli&s;h, or alter it, and when the Period arrived, wherein he &s;aw fit to &s;et a&s;ide, and &s;uper&s;ede this Law of outward and carnal Ordinances, by bringing forward into full View, and <HI>&s;ole Obligation,</HI> the Sub&s;tance pointed to by it, his &s;piritual and more excellent Covenant; it was nece&s;&s;ary that it &s;hould appear to be done, by clear Demon&s;trations of the &s;ame &s;overeign Autho|rity, in as public a Manner, and at the mo&s;t proper Sea&s;on for it. Accordingly the gracious Di&s;pen&s;ation of the Go&s;pel was introduced by Evidences of Divine Authority equally extra|ordinary, and equally &s;uited to its placid and falutary Nature.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the numerous Predictions of the Prophets concerning the Me&s;&s;iah, the Advent of his Forerunner the <HI>Bapti&s;t,</HI> and the miracu|lous Conception of our Saviour by the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, witne&s;s the many wonderful Works
<PB N="82" REF="021391_0084_0FB369D75DF49058">he performed, the unaccountable Darkne&s;s, and the rending of the Veil of the Temple throughout from Top to Bottom, upon his giving up the Gho&s;t, denoting the Separation, Conclu&s;ion, and pa&s;&s;ing away of all Sign and Ceremony, and the Di&s;clo&s;ure of the Sub&s;tance in Spirit and Truth; his a&s;toni&s;hing Re&s;ur|rection, and that of the Bodies of buried Saints which aro&s;e and went into the City; and his vi&s;ible A&s;cen&s;ion, attended with the glorious Mini&s;tration of Angels. After all this, at the Time of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Fea&s;t of <HI>Pen|teco&s;t,</HI> annually ob&s;erved in Memorial of the giving forth of the Law on Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> the Apo&s;tles and Di&s;ciples, Male and Female, being a&s;&s;embled together, according to the Lord's Command, the Holy Spirit gave a two-fold Demon&s;tration of its Advent, as the admi|ni&s;trative Power of the Chri&s;tian Di&s;pen&s;ation, then to commence without any Mixture of a legal or &s;hadowy Nature; fir&s;t, by the Appear|ance of cloven Tongues, as of Fire, which &s;ate upon <HI>each</HI> of them. Second, by filling their Hearts with the Holy Gho&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts ii.</NOTE> to &s;uch a Degree, that they began to &s;peak with other Tongues, or in other Languages be&s;ides their own, as the Spirit gave them Utterance. Indued with Heavenly Wi&s;dom and Power, and infla|med with Divine Love and Fervour, they were now qualified to put in Practice the Commi&s;|&s;ion before given, in a verbal Manner, by the great Lord and Lawgiver. To <HI>divers</HI> of them were likewi&s;e added, the miraculous Powers of healing all Manner of Di&s;ea&s;es; the Dumb were made to &s;peak, the Deaf to hear, the Lame to walk, the Blind to &s;ee; Demoniacs
<PB N="83" REF="021391_0085_0FB369E02DABB620">were di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and the Dead were rai&s;ed and re&s;tored to Life.</P>
<P>But the&s;e extraordinary Powers were neither conferred upon all, nor confined to the Apo&s;|tles only; yet <HI>a Mea&s;ure of the &s;ame Spirit</HI> was communicated to <HI>every one of them, Women as well as Men;</HI> otherwi&s;e <HI>Peter</HI>'s Application of the Prophecy of <HI>Joel</HI> had not been true. They were <HI>all</HI> filled with the Holy Gho&s;t, but diffe|rently gifted, and qualified by it, for different Services, according to the Will and Wi&s;dom of the great Di&s;pen&s;er.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. xii. 8, &amp;c.</NOTE> <Q>To one is given <HI>by the Spirit</HI> the Word of Wi&s;dom; to another the Word of Knowledge by the &s;ame Spirit; to another Faith by the &s;ame Spirit; to ano|ther the Gift of Healing by the &s;ame Spirit; to another the working of Miracles; to ano|ther Prophecy; to another di&s;cerning of Spirits; to another divers Kinds of Tongues; to another the Interpretation of Tongues. But <HI>all the&s;e</HI> worketh that <HI>one and the &s;elf &s;ame Spirit, dividing to every Man &s;everally as he will.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Hence it appears, that what are commonly called Miracles, are not nece&s;&s;ary or e&s;&s;ential to Divine In&s;piration, but only <HI>adjunctive Ope|rations</HI> of the Spirit thereto, which have been occa&s;ionally &s;uper-added, and therefore may either totally cea&s;e, when the Occa&s;ions for which they were added are over, or continue to be u&s;ed as it &s;hall appear requi&s;ite to Divine Wi&s;dom. When therefore the Go&s;pel was &s;o far &s;pread and e&s;tabli&s;hed, in the Parts then intended, that the End for which tho&s;e extraor|dinary Powers were afforded was an&s;wered they were gradually withdrawn from the Church;
<PB N="84" REF="021391_0086_0FB369E1E02DA7D8">which was left, in the general, upon its proper and permanent Bottom, the <HI>immediate In&s;pi|ration of the Holy Spirit.</HI> No Nece&s;&s;ity there|fore can be pleaded for the con&s;tant Continuance of miraculous Powers, or &s;uch a Spirit of Pro|phecy, as &s;ignifies a peculiar Gift of foretelling future Events; but only of tho&s;e <HI>&s;upernatural Influences,</HI> which are requi&s;ite to enlighten, quicken, regenerate, &s;anctify, bring forth the Fruits of the Spirit in Man, enable him to fill up his Duty, and finally prepare him for a Coele&s;tial Man&s;ion. <HI>The&s;e</HI> are indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to be continued. They are of moral Con&s;ideration, and immediately influential to the Preparation and Salvation of every Man, which Miracle and Prediction are not.</P>
<P N="3">3. Notwith&s;tanding manife&s;t Appearances of extraordinary Power were added, both to the Introduction of the Law, and that of the Go&s;pel, they are not to be con&s;idered <HI>as Parts</HI> of either, but <HI>as Sanctions</HI> requi&s;ite to their In&s;ti|tution; &s;o I believe, &s;ome divine Exertions of a miraculous Nature have been evidenced, at Times, under both Admini&s;trations, as well as before them; either for the Convincement of doubtful Per&s;ons, or to give additional Weight and Authority to the Mini&s;try of &s;ome in&s;pired Servants of God, among&s;t tho&s;e pre&s;ent with them, or to encourage and confirm them in their Service. Though I doubt not but this hath &s;ometimes been the Ca&s;e &s;ince the fir&s;t Century, and may remain to be &s;o to the End of Time, for neither the Power nor Good|ne&s;s of the Almighty is &s;hortened; yet I am al&s;o of Opinion, that miraculous Appearances have been le&s;s publick, and more &s;paringly
<PB N="85" REF="021391_0087_0FB369E397CEA678">afforded &s;ince the fir&s;t Century than before it; which may be in Part owing to the Declen&s;ion of the profe&s;&s;ing Churches. I al&s;o believe, according to the prophetic Declarations of the. Apo&s;tles, that under the declined and darkened State of both Teachers and Hearers, many &s;trange Signs, and lying Wonders have been, and &s;till may be &s;uffered to be impo&s;ed upon the Credulity of a di&s;obedient People, by fal&s;e Pre|tenders, for the Support of a corrupt Intere&s;t, and the Aggrandi&s;ement of the Conductors. Undoubtedly, tho&s;e my&s;terious Delu&s;ions have been abundantly more numerous for many Centuries pa&s;t, than the Exertions of Divine Power in an extraordinary Way.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Continuation of exterior Miracles is not e&s;&s;ential to the Mini&s;tration of the Go&s;pel; for was it &s;o, Chri&s;tianity could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t without them. Yet, though they are not of ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity thereunto, they may be occa|&s;ionally u&s;ed, or not, as the Sovereign Wi&s;dom &s;ees meet. But that they are &s;till con&s;tantly, or periodically continued in any particular Church, as a peculiar Mark of its being the only true Church of Chri&s;t, above all others, I find no Warrant to believe. Preten&s;ions of this Kind, naturally put thinking Minds upon looking for a &s;uperior Excellency in the Doc|trines, and Practices of &s;uch a Church; and when they find it abound in Super&s;tition and Pomp, coercive Impo&s;ition, proud Hierarchy, Craft, Lucre, and Idolatry, even bordering upon Polithei&s;m; for what el&s;e is the Adora|tion of Saints, and Sinners under that Title, by attributing a Kind of Omnipre&s;ence, and Influence in the Court of Heaven to them?
<PB N="86" REF="021391_0088_0FB369E563936FE8">When they find the&s;e, and other mon&s;trous Ab&s;urdities in the e&s;tabli&s;hed Doctrines of &s;uch a Church, in&s;tead of the Simplicity, Purity, Humility, Love and Life of the Go&s;pel; what can they conclude of tho&s;e Preten&s;ions, but that they are the deceitful Juggles of Impo&s;ture, and the Legends of Folly? The very Ends mo&s;t of them are calculated to an&s;wer, &s;ufficiently evidence their Fal&s;hood, and &s;hew, whatever they are, that they are not Divine.</P>
<P>It doth not appear, that in the primitive Age of Chri&s;tianity, tho&s;e who were &s;ometimes attended with miraculous Powers, were always &s;o accompanied in their Mini&s;try; nor that all in&s;pired Mini&s;ters were ever enabled to work Miracles in the Sight of the People. Seeing therefore it is evident, that the&s;e extraordinary Powers are not e&s;&s;ential to an in&s;pired Mini|&s;try, they are not the nece&s;&s;ary Proofs of it; nor the Want of them an Argument, that a Mini&s;ter is not in&s;pired. But though the&s;e are not e&s;&s;ential to Chri&s;tianity, <HI>immediate In&s;pi|ration is con&s;titutionally &s;o.</HI> The <HI>Excellency</HI> of the Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation is, that it is not a Mixture of Sign and Sub&s;tance, as that of the <HI>Jews</HI> was, nor a temporary, but <HI>a &s;tanding Mini&s;tration of the Spirit.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Seeing no further Change of Di&s;pen&s;ati|ons is ever to be made, nor any other Doctrine to be preached, but that of our Saviour and his Apo&s;tles, which upon its Commencement, received a miraculous Confirmation, &s;ufficient for its la&s;ting E&s;tabli&s;hment, People are not now to expect, or call for Miracles from tho&s;e who preach the Chri&s;tian Doctrine; but to turn to, and attend upon that Divine Principle
<PB N="87" REF="021391_0089_0FB369E967555218">pointed out in the Scriptures, as manife&s;ted in the Brea&s;t of each Individual, the Mini&s;tra|tion of Chri&s;t in Spirit. This will give the &s;incere and humble Receiver more clear and particular Demon&s;tration than outward Signs and Tokens could do; for the Powers whence the&s;e proceed, may be di&s;puted, but the inter|nal Evidence of the Light of Chri&s;t, the Life of Men, as rightly waited for, and adhered to, leaves no Doubt in the Mind concerning its Divine Nature and Authority. Hence <HI>Robert Barclay</HI> a&s;&s;erts, in the Words of the primitive Prote&s;tants, there is no Need now of outward Miracles to avouch the Doctrines of the Go&s;|pel; yet acknowledges, that &s;ome did appear upon its Revival in the la&s;t Century. But to return.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> iii. &s;hews that the Mini|&s;tration of the Go&s;pel far excels that of the Law, and that its Excellency &s;tands in its <HI>Spirituality.</HI> Having &s;poken of the Law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. iii. 8, 9, 10, 11.</NOTE> Ver&s;e 7, he &s;ubjoins, <Q>How &s;hall not the <HI>Mini&s;tra|tion of the Spirit</HI> be rather glorious?

<P>The Vitality and Glory of Chri&s;tianity lies in the clear Admini&s;tration of the Holy Spirit, without any Veil of legal or ritual Adumbra|tions.

Neither the Acquirements of the College, nor the Formalities of human Authority, can furni&s;h that Humility which fitteth for God's Teach|ing. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Arts and Languages, weak People are puffed up with a Conceit of Supe|riority, which leads from Self-denial and the daily Cro&s;s, into Pride and Self-&s;ufficiency; and in&s;tead of waiting for, and depending upon the Wi&s;dom and Power of God, into a Confi|dence in the Wi&s;dom of this World, and a devotional Satisfaction in the Rote of external Forms and Ordinances.

<P>Who&s;oever deny that the Holy Spirit, and its internal Operations, are now to be &s;en&s;ibly experienced, only demon&s;trate their own In&s;en|&s;ibility thereof.

The &s;ame Work, in due Mea&s;ure, is ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to every one, and the like Sen&s;e of it proportionably clear and certain to all who experience Regeneration. No Man can obtain Felicity out of God's Kingdom, nor can any enter the Kingdom without being born of the Spirit, neither is the Work of the New-birth wrought in&s;en&s;ibly in any. Whatever <HI>Medium incognitum,</HI> or <HI>unknown Means</HI> Men imagine, in&s;en&s;ible Operation is not Regeneration. It is a mere Deception.

This largely &s;hewn in Variety of Matter to the End of this Chapter.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. HAVING endeavoured plainly to &s;hew what the leading Principles of the People called <HI>Quakers</HI> are, and that they are the genuine Doctrines of true Chri&s;tianity, I &s;hall now proceed to take more particular Notice of
<PB N="95" REF="021391_0097_0FB369F9F07C1818">divers material Parts of my Opponent's Treati&s;e.</P>
<P>His in&s;i&s;ting that the <HI>Quakers</HI> Doctrine cen|ters in the reprobationary Scheme, and that <HI>Barclay</HI> was <HI>as much</HI> a Prede&s;tinarian as <HI>John Calvin,</HI> is merely his own Mi&s;take. He grounds it not upon their Doctrine, but what he improperly imagines to be &s;o. Page 14, he &s;ays, <Q><HI>Barclay</HI> and his Friend <HI>&s;peak of no Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance which enables Per&s;ons to be pa&s;&s;ive,</HI> that the Light within may operate and &s;ave.</Q> Whereas, in my Ob&s;ervations, P. 82, I quote <HI>Barclay,</HI> &s;aying, <Q>As Man is <HI>wholly unable</HI> of him&s;elf to work with the Grace, neither <HI>can he move one Step</HI> out of the natural Condition, <HI>until the Grace of God lay hold upon him,</HI> &s;o, it is po&s;&s;ible to him to be pa&s;&s;ive, and not re&s;i&s;t it, as it is po&s;&s;i|ble for him to re&s;i&s;t it.</Q> That is, <HI>by the Power of Divine Grace laying hold of, or in|fluencing the Spirit of Man, it fir&s;t becomes po&s;&s;ible for him to be pa&s;&s;ive, and not re&s;i&s;t its Operation;</HI> which is the <HI>fir&s;t Step</HI> Man takes in the Way of Salvation. "Without me,"<NOTE PLACE="marg">John xv. 5.</NOTE> &s;aith our Saviour, "ye can do nothing." I therefore added, <Q>Man cannot &s;et <HI>one &s;ingle Step</HI> towards his Salvation, without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Grace of God, as the <HI>fir&s;t moving,</HI> and <HI>continually enabling Cau&s;e,</HI> both of the <HI>Will</HI> and the <HI>Deed.</HI></Q> So that though <HI>Pa&s;&s;ivene&s;s</HI> is the Beginning of the Work, he is <HI>previou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed to it</HI> by Virtue of the Holy Spirit. This manife&s;ts the Untruth of <HI>S. N</HI>'s A&s;&s;ertion, P. 212, and the Nullity of all his Rea&s;onings from it, that <Q>the Apolo|gi&s;t <HI>will not &s;uffer</HI> the Honour of the fir&s;t
<PB N="96" REF="021391_0098_0FB36A00235B9AF0">Step of the Soul towards Salvation to be a&s;cribed to the Light or Grace within.</Q> On the contrary we attribute the Whole of Man's Salvation to it, fir&s;t and la&s;t, without at all placing Man's De&s;truction to the Account of his Maker; which <HI>John Calvin</HI> directly doth.</P>
<P>What our Doctrine teacheth is, 1. That Man has no Ability to &s;ave him&s;elf, is not naturally in a State of equal Freedom to Good or Evil at his Plea&s;ure, nor is in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that Faith which is nece&s;&s;ary to his Salvation. 2. That the Redeemer affords a Manife&s;tation of his Spirit to the Soul of every Man, by which, at Sea&s;ons, he checks his corrupt Incli|nations, &s;tops them in their Career, and puts it in his Power to reflect upon his pre&s;ent Con|dition, and <HI>become pa&s;&s;ive</HI> to the Operation of this inward Principle. If he re&s;i&s;t it not, but &s;tant in Submi&s;&s;ion, it takes further Hold of him, gives him &s;o <HI>to believe in it,</HI> as to &s;uffer it in &s;ome Degree to unite with, abide in, and operate upon him. In this Situation, he feels Strength and Comfort &s;pring up from it, which increa&s;eth his <HI>Faith and Tru&s;t</HI> therein, and gradually enables and engages him to <HI>become active;</HI> that is, to join heartily in Concurrence with its Operations, and to proceed from Faith to Faith, and from one Degree of Grace to another, till he attain to know the New-birth of the Spirit, and to participate in Degree of the glorious Light, Life, and Nature of the Heavenly Kingdom.</P>
<P N="2">2. God hath made Man a rea&s;onable Crea|ture, and therefore requires a willing Obedi|ence of him, in order to the high Reward of
<PB N="97" REF="021391_0099_0FB36A015E28CF58">eternal Felicity; and if he repeatedly vi&s;its all with the Reaches of his Grace, and continues Time after Time to convict, per&s;uade, and wooe, as the Scriptures declare, that he may prevail upon him to come to Repentance; doth he not go as far as rea&s;onable Creatures can claim, without violating the rational Liberty he affords? Let Man but yield Obedience to his Convictions, and &s;ee if he can charge his Creator with Partiality, or hard Mea&s;ure. It is the unprofitable and unprofiting Servant that doth this.</P>
<P>Education and Tradition do certainly pre|po&s;&s;e&s;s, and give a Bias to the Mind again&s;t every Doctrine different to tho&s;e it hath been taught; but the Divine Light, at Times, darts in upon the Soul unawares, as quick as Light|ning, penetrates through all its Darkne&s;s and every fal&s;e Colour, di&s;turbs it in its polluted Re&s;ts, and carnal Gratifications, &s;hews its Bondage under them, and in&s;pires the &s;ecret Wi&s;h and heaving Sigh to be delivered, attended with &s;ome Degree of Re&s;olution again&s;t them. This being the opening of Divine Light upon the Mind, is called <HI>the Day of God's Vi&s;itation,</HI> the <HI>Time of Grace unto Man;</HI> wherein <HI>Life and Death</HI> are di&s;tingui&s;hed in him, and Liberty is not only given him to chu&s;e Life, which he could not do before, but al&s;o a &s;uitable Mea&s;ure of Ability to love and cleave to the <HI>Grace,</HI> he is vi&s;ited with, and thereby to come to Repentance, and be &s;aved.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tit. ii. 11.</NOTE> For this <HI>Grace</HI> is the Spirit of the Saviour, and <HI>brings the Power of Salvation in it.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e merciful Vi&s;itations of Divine Grace are often repeated, by Night as well as by Day.
<PB N="98" REF="021391_0100_0FB36A02F7790CC0">"God" &s;aith <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>Elihu,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Job xxxiii. 14, &amp;c</NOTE> <Q>&s;peaketh once, yea twice, yet Man perceiveth it not, in a Dream, in a Vi&s;ion of the Night, when deep Sleep falleth upon Man, in Slumbrings upon the Bed. Then he openeth the Ears of Men, and &s;ealeth their In&s;truction; that he may <HI>withdraw Man from his Purpo&s;e, and hide Pride from Man.</HI></Q> He then proceeds to &s;hew, how he operates upon the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Soul, in the Work of Repentance and Morti|fication, and what &s;hall be its I&s;&s;ue.

<P>The great FATHER OF MERCIES, is plea&s;ed to continue his gracious Vi&s;itations from on high to back&s;liding Men, till they are become &s;o determined in Wickedne&s;s, and &s;o habitually united to its Servitude, that like the Servants in <HI>Exodus</HI> xxi. 5, 6. they <HI>will not</HI> be freed from it.

<P><PB N="99" REF="021391_0101_0FB36A045D9AE350">
When Per&s;ons are thus judicially hardened, and given up to their own Hearts Lu&s;ts, and beloved Delu&s;ions, and le&s;t in a State of In&s;en|&s;ibility of the Divine Principle, they may blindly mi&s;take it for Peace and Security. To &s;uch, Con&s;cience becomes, for the pre&s;ent, ob&s;cured, and as a Book &s;hut up, wherein they cannot read; but in the Day of the righteous Retribution of the great Judge of Quick and Dead, this hidden Volume will again be unfolded, by him who openeth, and none can &s;hut, and a ju&s;t Di&s;tribution made to every one according to what is written therein (for it will prove either a Book of Life or of Death to every Man) to them who, by patient Conti|nuance in well-doing, have &s;ought the Glory of God, their own Salvation, and the Good of others, Immortality and eternal Life; but to tho&s;e who have continued in Di&s;obedience and Rebellion again&s;t God, Tribulation and Angui&s;h both inexpre&s;&s;ible and interminable.</P>
<P N="3">3. Can any rea&s;onable Creature think it po&s;&s;ible, that the &s;ame Spirit and Power of Goodne&s;s which conde&s;cended to take our low Nature upon him, &s;uffer in, and &s;acrifice that Nature whil&s;t connected with it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 John ii. 2.</NOTE> <HI>a Propitia|tion for the Sins of the whole World,</HI> could ever intentionally con&s;ign the Majority, or any Part of the &s;ame World, to unavoidable or uncon|ditional Mi&s;ery? It appears from his Attributes of Truth, Equity, Wi&s;dom, Mercy, and Good|ne&s;s, impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould either actually oblige any of his Creatures to &s;in, that they might be mi&s;erable; or, when he has created them, to de&s;ert them to Sin and Mi&s;ery, by entirely with-holding from them that which is
<PB N="100" REF="021391_0102_0FB36A0873EEBD20">nece&s;&s;ary to their Help and Pre&s;ervation. We therefore rationally conclude, that he doth not only &s;et Good and Evil before Man in their ju&s;t Di&s;tinctions, but at the &s;ame Time, enables him to <HI>chu&s;e</HI> which he will follow; and further, that he &s;tirs up and a&s;&s;i&s;ts Man to <HI>de&s;ire</HI> after true Felicity, and as he abides in this De&s;ire, he <HI>empowers</HI> him to &s;trive, pre&s;s, and wre&s;tle effectually for Deliverance and Pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>The primary Motions of Volition in the Mind being very nice and delicate, are not ea&s;y, if po&s;&s;ible, for Men to form a preci&s;e Idea of, without the Light of God's Spirit; whence &s;ome have taken Occa&s;ion to charge the diffe|rent Di&s;po&s;itions of Men towards the Vi&s;ita|tions of Divine Grace, to God's Account, by which they render him <HI>the primary Author of Evil,</HI> who by the &s;pecial Peculiarity of his E&s;&s;ence, is too unchangeably perfect in all his Attributes, ever to warp from perfect Recti|tude.

How then could the&s;e be produced by an Act of his Will, or be the genuine Fruit of his Power, either mediately or immediately?

<P>From Purity, Goodne&s;s, and Virtue, no Impurity, Vice, or Evil could naturally ari&s;e. But that Text hath been objected,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke xvii. 1.</NOTE> <Q>It is im|po&s;&s;ible

<P N="4">4.

It is contrary to his Nature, therefore again&s;t his Will, and what he could not &s;uffer to originate without offering Means to prevent it, and &s;hewing his Di&s;plea&s;ure with it; nor can he con&s;i&s;tently be conceived to extend per&s;onal Approbation or Aver&s;ion to any, exclu&s;ive of the State of the Parties re&s;pecting Good and Evil.</P>
<P>That &s;ome obey, and others refu&s;e Obedience to the Manife&s;tations of Divine Grace, is cer|tainly true; and we believe, the Cau&s;e of this Difference is not of God, but entirely owing to the Man. Let him that doubts it, enquire in his own Con&s;cience. The faithful witne&s;s there, by its Condemnations for Evil, will plainly &s;hew him, that the Fault is his own. What Man is there upon Earth without the&s;e compunctive Strokes? Who has not, al&s;o, felt at Times, Inclinations and Di&s;po&s;itions excited in him towards Virtue and a good Life; and who knows not, that when he followed them, he found Peace in his Obedience; and when he turned from this &s;alutary Pur&s;uit to one of a contrary Nature, he incurred Trouble and Condemnation? Can a rea&s;onable Creature need further Proofs, that both tho&s;e convicting Reprehen&s;ions and Comforts, are the internal immediate Adjudications of a ju&s;t, good, pow|erful,
<PB N="103" REF="021391_0105_0FB36A0CD867D550">omni-pre&s;ent, all-intelligent Principle? And <HI>what is this but God;</HI> and <HI>for what End doth he thus attend every Soul and Con&s;cience, but that all may come to Repentance, and experience Salvation?</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. The fir&s;t moving, true, and proper Cau&s;e of Man's Salvation, is the <HI>Goodne&s;s and Love of God</HI> to him. The <HI>e&s;&s;ential Means</HI> by which he effects it, is the Operation of his own Holy Spirit on the Soul of Man, often immediately, and &s;ometimes in&s;trumentally, by making u&s;e of exterior and incidental Things, and working by them as <HI>&s;econdary</HI> Means; &s;uch as Preach|ing, reading the Scriptures, and other good Books, pious Conver&s;ation, Wor&s;hip, Mercies, Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, &amp;c. After this Manner it plea&s;eth Divine Wi&s;dom to exerci&s;e the Body in the Service of the Soul, whereby both are bettered divers Ways. It is God by his Holy Spirit, who worketh all Good in Man, both as to the <HI>Will</HI> and the <HI>Deed.</HI> It is by Grace we are &s;aved, through Faith; or in the Way of Faith. That Faith which worketh by the Love of God to the Purifying of the Heart, and the Production of good Works.

Yet it is not by the Works that we are &s;aved, as <HI>the Cau&s;e</HI> of Salvation to us, but <HI>by Grace,</HI> through the Root of them, the Faith, by which we believe in God, open to, and receive him, cleave to him, tru&s;t in him, and &s;o lay hold of eternal Life. This Faith is not our Faculty, but the Gift of God to us.

<P>If Man be allowed no Choice, he can incur no Guilt. He mu&s;t at &s;ome Time be at Liberty, or he can never do ami&s;s.

All that can be allowed is, that by forming rea&s;onable Crea|tures, and con&s;tituting them in a State of rati|onal Freedom, he afforded them the Oppor|tunity of making their Duty their Choice; but never willed them to abu&s;e it, by lap&s;ing from the Grace he favoured them with for their Pre&s;ervation, dividing their Wills from his Will, and counteracting his &s;alutary Laws; to whom they owed their Being, and on whom they mu&s;t ab&s;olutely depend for all the Good they ever could enjoy. And notwith&s;tanding he fore&s;aw they might be prevailed on to make a wrong U&s;e of their Liberty, he certainly intended to favour them with Means amply &s;ufficient for their Recovery and Re&s;toration. Though he forbore forcibly to hinder them from falling into Iniquity, he did all that could be done to prevent it in rational Creatures. He forewarned them again&s;t it, &s;hewed them the dreadful Con&s;equence of it, and unque&s;ti|onably armed them with Power, by his Spirit, to with&s;tand all Temptation to it, had they kept under it.

10. We are told, <HI>The Will is always deter|mined by the &s;tronge&s;t Motive.</HI> Has the Will no Liberty then, at any Time? Is it always &s;o forcibly determined, in all its Motions, by Circum&s;tances and Motives &s;ucce&s;&s;ively ari&s;ing upon it, from the original Con&s;titution of Things, that every Man is nece&s;&s;arily obliged to think, &s;peak, and act ju&s;t as he doth? <HI>No,</HI> it is an&s;wered, <HI>In temporal Matters the Mind has a Liberty of Choice.</HI> Why not in Spirituals as well as Temporals?

The Man is equally in Bondage either Way. To tell him, that his Will is free, becau&s;e he doth as he plea&s;es when he acts agreeable to tho&s;e Motives, and the Di&s;po&s;itions they nece&s;&s;arily excite, or enlarge, whil&s;t at the &s;ame Time, they are unvoidable by him, and &s;o irre&s;i&s;tibly influential to his corrupt Inclinations, that they are rendered eagerly concurrent with them; to argue in this Ca&s;e, that becau&s;e the Party pur&s;ues the Gra|tification of his pre&s;ent De&s;ires, he acts upon a Principle of Freedom, is to a&s;&s;ert an evident Fal&s;hood.

The Nature of Liberty &s;uppo&s;es no ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity, but &s;uch a Freedom as may admit of Choice, without a pre-determining Power obliging one Way only. 'Tis true, the Powers of Men, as well as tho&s;e of all other Creatures, are nece&s;&s;arily limitted to their proper Sphere. No Creature can exceed the Bounds of its proper Element, yet it can act with Freedom therein, as a Bird in the Air, or a Fi&s;h in the Water; &s;o Man, though unable to &s;tretch beyond the Compa&s;s of Humanity, is enabled to act at Liberty within it; and I conceive, a wi&s;e and good Being, though Omnipotent, would not put any Re&s;traint or Force upon him there, but for his Good.

<P>It is to be under&s;tood, that he who is &s;up|po&s;ed to act in this contrary Manner, towards his Creatures in the &s;ame State and Nature, doth it <HI>from one and the &s;ame Nature in him|&s;elf;</HI> or that he is differently determined towards them, from two different Natures of contrary Di&s;po&s;itions in him&s;elf?

But no Difficulty attends the Suppo&s;ition, that <HI>the &s;ame Nature</HI> &s;hould operate <HI>to different Effects</HI> upon Subjects in different Conditions.

Detachments of various Texts and Por|tions of Scripture, though indirect to the Subject, and alluding to different Con&s;idera|tions, have been pre&s;&s;ed, and martialled under divers Colours, to fix a cruel Partiality on our common Creator and Benefactor.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Edwards, P. 358, &amp;c.</NOTE> We are told, that he <HI>ordered</HI> the Ob&s;tinacy of <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> the Sin and Folly of <HI>Sihon,</HI> and the Kings of <HI>Canaan,</HI> the treacherous Rebellion of <HI>Zede|kiah</HI> again&s;t the King of <HI>Babylon,</HI> the Rapine and Ravages of <HI>Nebuchadnezzar,</HI> &amp;c. But properly con&s;idered, this was ordering Puni&s;h|ment for Sin, not Sin for Puni&s;hment. He hardeneth none till they have hardened them|&s;elves pa&s;t all Probability of Repentance, and then he leaves them to the Mi&s;-rule of their own beloved Lu&s;ts and Vices; and what are treated as unrighteous Ravages, though really &s;uch in the Committers of them, are, re&s;pect|ing the Almighty, the righteous Execution of his Ju&s;tice again&s;t tho&s;e who have filled up
<PB N="119" REF="021391_0121_0FB36A3408CAAFC8">their Mea&s;ure of Iniquity and abu&s;ed his gra|cious Goodne&s;s and long Forbearance towards them, till he &s;ees fit no longer to continue it to them. Thus he puni&s;heth the <HI>&s;ettled Wick|edne&s;s</HI> of &s;ome, by the Wickedne&s;s of their Enemies, which he permits to be turned upon them; and afterwards proceeds in like Manner with their Cha&s;ti&s;ers, when they al&s;o have filled up their Mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>I &s;hall omit at pre&s;ent to proceed further with the Scriptures alledged again&s;t the univer|&s;al Exten&s;ion of Divine Goodne&s;s to the Souls of Men, and acknowledge my Inability to conceive, what <HI>wi&s;e, holy, and mo&s;t excellent Ends and Purpo&s;es</HI> could be an&s;wered, by the <HI>Almighty's di&s;po&s;ing the State of Events in &s;uch a Manner, that Sin will mo&s;t certainly and infal|libly follow,</HI> and eternal Mi&s;ery to innumerable Multitudes of his Creatures in Con&s;equence; and al&s;o <HI>what Glory</HI> can accrue to a Being infi|nite in Wi&s;dom, Power and Goodne&s;s, from his <HI>continually</HI> creating immortal and rea&s;onable Creatures, with no better Intention towards them but that mo&s;t barbarous one of irredeem|able Infelicity. I am al&s;o at a Lo&s;s to di&s;|cover, what Comfort can ari&s;e to an humane, virtuous and charitable Mind from &s;uch a cruel Con&s;ideration. Tho&s;e Hearts mu&s;t be very unfeeling for others, and their Conceit in their own Favour very &s;trong, who, fancying to them&s;elves a per&s;onal Election, can pride and con&s;ole them&s;elves in their own imagined Secu|rity, and the inequitable De&s;truction of the major Part of their Species. Mi&s;led Men, like the unprofitable Servant, may imagine &s;uch unju&s;t Severity in the unchangeable Per|fection
<PB N="120" REF="021391_0122_0FB36A35760BEC18">of Equity, but tho&s;e who have the Love of God &s;hed abroad in their Hearts, by the Holy Gho&s;t, find it to flow freely towards all Mankind without Exception, and to engage them to wi&s;h the Salvation of all. This is a &s;tronger Proof to them of the Univer&s;ality of God's good Will to Men, than all the &s;ophi&s;ti|cal Rea&s;onings of tho&s;e who remain in&s;en&s;ible of it, to the contrary.</P>
<P N="18">18. Before I leave this Subject, let me ob&s;erve, that my Opponent, P. 198, after his u&s;ual Manner of <HI>making Meanings</HI> for me, will have it, that according to &s;ome of my Expre&s;&s;ions; <Q>Mankind are by Nature, in &s;uch a State, that if God does not afford them &s;ufficient Means of Salvation, <HI>he is unju&s;t;</HI> &s;urely then, there <HI>can be no Grace</HI> in his giving them the&s;e, for, what&s;oever he is <HI>bound</HI> in Ju&s;tice and Equity to be&s;tow, cannot be Grace. This is an Ob&s;ervation which carries <HI>its own Evidence</HI> with it.</Q></P>
<P>Every Ob&s;ervation carries <HI>its own Evidence</HI> with it, but it may not be a true Evidence. What I a&s;&s;ert is, that as it would be an Act of Inju&s;tice and Cruelty, to create rational and &s;en&s;ible Souls, with no better Purpo&s;e towards them, than to render them inexpre&s;&s;ibly and eternally mi&s;erable, by continually &s;upporting them in Being, and as continually with-hold|ing that from them without which they never can be relieved; <HI>&s;o it is impo&s;&s;ible</HI> for God, who is mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially and immutably Ju&s;tice and Goodne&s;s it&s;elf, to act otherwi&s;e by his Crea|tures than according to Ju&s;tice and Goodne&s;s; and therefore, that he cerrainly doth not with|hold, but affords his Creatures the Means
<PB N="121" REF="021391_0123_0FB36A3711DFA348">nece&s;&s;ary to their Felicity. I believe his Mer|cies are over all, and to all, with a <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>gracious</HI> Intent towards them; and that the univer&s;al Redeemer purcha&s;ed Gifts for tho&s;e who prove rebellious, as well as others, and that all are vi&s;ited with a Manife&s;tation of his Spirit, that they may profit by it; and though they do lap&s;e from the vi&s;iting Power, and often lo&s;e the di&s;po&s;ing A&s;&s;i&s;tances afforded them, he &s;till follows them, Time after Time, in long Forbearance, and often revi&s;its them, of his freely-abounding Grace and Mercy, that they may be prevailed upon to come to Repentance and be &s;aved. Hence, according to common Phra&s;eology, we &s;tile his univer&s;al primary A&s;&s;i&s;tance an Act of Equity, and his nume|rous Repetitions thereof Acts of Goodne&s;s; yet neither is the Fir&s;t without Grace and Mercy, nor are the Latter void of Equity. As to that of God's being <HI>bound</HI> in Ju&s;tice and Equity, I do not &s;ee the Propriety of that Language. I apprehend, he is not <HI>bound</HI> by any thing, but that he always acts in the <HI>perfect Freedom of his own Nature;</HI> which is that of <HI>Equity, Truth and Goodne&s;s.</HI> For, &s;trictly &s;peaking, I think it le&s;s proper to &s;ay, that he <HI>has</HI> what we mean by the&s;e Terms, than that he <HI>is</HI> what we intend by them; and as his E&s;&s;ence can never admit of the lea&s;t Imperfection, it is impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould ever be, or act otherwi&s;e. It is therefore by a &s;trained and unju&s;t Inuendo, that <HI>S. N.</HI> would infer from my Words, that irreverent upbraid|ing Kind of Expre&s;&s;ion, <Q>If God does not afford them &s;ufficient Means of Salvation, <HI>he is unju&s;t.</HI></Q> Should I follow his Manner
<PB N="122" REF="021391_0124_0FB36A3A40E1D868">of Rea&s;oning, I might as properly infer, that he holds Grace and Ju&s;tice are incompatible with each other, and cannot po&s;&s;ibly concur in the &s;ame Act; which, I think, he will hardly affirm. Doth not he, as well as I, a&s;&s;ert that God's Acts are according to Ju&s;tice? Will he allow me to &s;ay, that he therefore denies there is either Grace or Mercy in them? Should I put &s;uch an Abu&s;e upon his Expre&s;&s;ions, he would unque&s;tionably be&s;tow the Severity of his Ju&s;tice upon me; which I acknowledge he has often done with great Freedom, with|out any ju&s;t Merit on my Part.</P>

The Argu|ments they ground upon this imaginary Foun|dation, are &s;ufficient to impeach their Ba&s;is; for they carry an evident Face of Fal&s;hood.

<P N="1">1.

I'll own my&s;elf obliged to him, if he will &s;hew me where the Scripture either &s;ays, or fairly implies, that the Spirit is not to be received without their In&s;tru|mentality.

<P>Chri&s;t is with his true Followers, and will be to the End of the World. To &s;ay, he is always with them in the Scriptures, appears to me, too great a Strain of Language for Truth to accompany.

We have fre|quently experienced, and <HI>always</HI> allowed, that the Spirit of Truth often u&s;eth, and openeth Truth by the Scriptures, as an in&s;trumental Means; and we al&s;o a&s;&s;ert, that the &s;ame Spirit often hath opened Truths, given a Sen&s;e of their Conditions, and admini&s;tered Help, to &s;incere and attentive Minds, without the In&s;trumentality of the Scriptures. This is the

What is there left to determine the Matter? Will Churches or Councils do it? They jangle from Year to Year, or from Age to Age, and leave the Difference as wide as they found it. The <HI>true Sen&s;e</HI> &s;till remains only with the Divine Author of the di&s;puted Texts, and he alone is able to communicate it.

<PB N="140" REF="021391_0142_0FB36A60353A4438">undeniable Director. 2. They are not the <HI>primary Director;</HI> becau&s;e the Illumination of the Holy Spirit that gave them forth, is requi|&s;ite to open the true Sen&s;e of tho&s;e numerous Parts of them, about which the Apprehen&s;ions of Men &s;o much differ. The Spirit al&s;o from which the Scriptures came, is <HI>original,</HI> and therefore <HI>primary</HI> to them; and as the Spirit only can open its own true Sen&s;e included in them, they are <HI>&s;econdary</HI> to the Spirit, as an In&s;trument in its Hand. 3. They are not <HI>the univer&s;al Director;</HI> becau&s;e it is not probable that One in Ten, if one in Twenty, of Man|kind, have ever had the Opportunity of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them. Seeing therefore this is the Ca&s;e, they cannot properly be pronounced, the <HI>complete, adequate, univer&s;al Rule of Mankind.</HI></P>
<P>Hence we e&s;teem them the <HI>&s;econdary</HI> Rule or Guide of Chri&s;tians, which being Divinely communicated for the U&s;e of all to whom they may come; and al&s;o being intrin&s;ically &s;uperior in Excellence to all other Writings, we prefer them above all others, and as thank|fully accept, and as comfortably u&s;e them, as any People upon Earth; verily believing, with the Holy Apo&s;tle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. xv. 4</NOTE> that they <Q>were written for our Learning, that we, through Pati|ence, and Comfort of the Sciptures might have Hope.</Q></P>
<P>This is not to depreciate the Scriptures, but to hold them in their proper Place, and due Superiority to the Works of Men, and Subor|dination to their Supreme Communicator, and only &s;ure Expounder. For the Holy Spirit is requi&s;ite to the right U&s;e of them, as the Agent to the In&s;trument; and what is an
<PB N="141" REF="021391_0143_0FB36A616D8AE3C8">In&s;trument without a Hand to guide and enforce it? And which is &s;uperior, the Agent or the In&s;trument? The Holy Spirit is the <HI>original Wi&s;dom</HI> whence the Scriptures came, and the &s;ole Power that can open, and give right Effects to them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">John xv. 13.</NOTE> <HI>The Spirit of Truth is given to guide into all Truth;</HI> is the only Thing that can do it, and con&s;equently <HI>the Supreme Guide</HI> afforded to Mankind.

<P>The &s;ame Scripture-Truths appear as diffe|rently to each Per&s;on, as their Under&s;tandings differ one from another. Human Intellects therefore mu&s;t be rectified, to enable them to &s;ee tho&s;e Truths in the &s;ame Sen&s;e. The Rectifier is the Spirit of Truth, which alone can unite them in the true Sen&s;e.</P>
<P>We &s;tick not to &s;tyle the Scriptures collec|tively, <HI>a Divine,</HI> or <HI>Chri&s;tian Rule;</HI> but we object to call them, <HI>The Rule of Faith and Practice,</HI> le&s;t that &s;hould be under&s;tood to imply we are to look for nothing further to be our Guide or Leader. The Scriptures them|&s;elves abundantly te&s;tify, there is &s;omething &s;uperior to them, which all ought to look for, and attend unto; that is, the Holy Spirit of the Supreme Legi&s;lator of Men, and Prime Author of the &s;acred Writings; in and by who&s;e Light and Power they are made in&s;tru|mentally u&s;eful, and adequate to the Purpo&s;es intended by them. Like a good Sun-dial, they are true and perfect in their Kind, that is, as Writings; but, re&s;pecting the Parts differently
<PB N="142" REF="021391_0144_0FB36A68B21676C8">under&s;tood, they may ju&s;tly bear the &s;ame Motto with the Dial, * <HI>Non &s;ine Lumine.</HI> For as the Dial without the Ca&s;t of the Sun-beams, has not its proper U&s;e, to tell the Time of the Day; neither doth the ambiguous Text an&s;wer its true End, infallibly to communicate the Mind of the Holy Spirit to different Under|&s;tandings, except the luminous Beams of the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s di&s;cover it to the attentive Mind.</P>
<P N="9">9. Our Oppo&s;ers call the Scriptures <HI>the primary Rule.</HI> We allow it is <HI>the prmiary written Rule,</HI> and in all Di&s;putes betwixt them and us, we abide by its Deci&s;ion, accord|ing to our under&s;tanding of the Sen&s;e of it, which they profe&s;s to do likewi&s;e by theirs. In all public Differences therefore we refer intentionally to the &s;ame Rule with them. But we have both plain Scripture and Expe|rience to &s;upport our Belief, that re&s;pecting the particular Duty of Individuals, every one hath in his own Brea&s;t, a nearer and more cer|tain Rule or Guide of Con&s;cience than the Scriptures; <HI>the Manife&s;tation of the Spirit given to every Man to profit withal,</HI> which duly ob&s;erved, gives a right Interpretation of Scrip|ture, &s;o far as is nece&s;&s;ary for them, and al&s;o the true&s;t Sen&s;e of each particular Per&s;on's Duty to him. When a Per&s;on feels the faith|ful Witne&s;s of God in his Con&s;cience, con|demning him for what is wrong, and approving him for what is right, does he not find it to &s;peak more clearly, particularly, and convict|ingly to his Ca&s;e and State, than he can read it in the Scriptures? Can he then conclude,
<PB N="143" REF="021391_0145_0FB36A6A7543AE60">that this truly-di&s;tingui&s;hing and mo&s;t &s;trik|ing Witne&s;s, is le&s;s than that <HI>Spirit of Truth,</HI> or <HI>Comforter,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">John xvi. 8.</NOTE> which <HI>convinceth the World of Sin, of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and of Judgment?</HI></P>
<P>Speaking of Per&s;ons unenlightened, I ob|&s;erved that <Q>every Man's Sen&s;e of Scripture, is his Scripture, and when he propo&s;es his Opponent &s;hall be determined by Scripture, he means according to his own Apprehen&s;ion of the Sen&s;e of it.</Q> This <HI>S.

<P>When Chri&s;t, after his Re&s;urrection,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke xxiv. 45.</NOTE> <HI>opened the Under&s;tandings of his Di&s;ciples that they might under&s;tand the Scriptures,</HI> was not the Divine Illumination in their Under&s;tandings, a more clear, certain and &s;uperior Evidence of the Sen&s;e of them, than all their Reading and Study could have afforded them, without &s;uch

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. PAGE 7. To introduce a weak Argu|ment, <HI>S. N.</HI> queries, <Q>Is the real Nature of the Spirit to be known either by mere Feelings, or metaphy&s;ical Specula|tions?</Q> An&s;w. The Divine Nature which the Faithful, in Mea&s;ure, have been made Par|takers of, they have known by a Divine Sen&s;a|tion of its <HI>Influence,</HI> communicated only by it&s;elf; as nothing but the Sun it&s;elf can reveal and impart its own Light and Warmth.</P>
<P>Ibid. <Q>They mu&s;t tell us what the&s;e Feel|ings are like?</Q> An&s;w. They are not like any Thing the natural Man is acquainted with. <Q>The natural Man receiveth not the Things of the Spirit of God, for they are <HI>Fooli&s;hne&s;s unto him;</HI> neither can he know them, becau&s;e they are &s;piritually di&s;cerned.</Q></P>
<P>Ibid. <Q>It is not conceived, however, that they can find out his <HI>E&s;&s;ence.</HI></Q> An&s;w. They do not pre&s;ume to find out his <HI>E&s;&s;ence.</HI> They are content with, and thankful for, the Di&s;|pen&s;ations he is plea&s;ed to make of his <HI>Influence;</HI> which this Author, P. 8. injudiciou&s;ly jum|bles together with Views, Sentiments, Effects, Production, Creature, &amp;c. Whereas the <HI>Influ|ence</HI>
<PB N="146" REF="021391_0148_0FB36A7383CC9860">&s;hed by the <HI>E&s;&s;ence</HI> is not of its Creation, but an Emanation of its own Nature, Power and Quality, which produceth tho&s;e Effects in the Creature, as the Potential Influence of the Sun, is of the Nature and Quality of the Sun, producing its &s;alutary Effects in external Nature, and &s;en&s;ibly operating upon &s;en&s;itive Creatures, &s;o as to enable them to &s;ee by its Light, and to feel the comforting Warmth of its Pre&s;ence, as well as truly to di&s;cover its Productions in and around them.</P>
<P>Having indi&s;criminately confounded Things that differ, <HI>S. N.</HI> proceeds thus to &s;yllogize upon it.</P>
<Q><P>That which is not known, felt or di&s;|cerned in its real Nature, cannot be a Rule of Action to any One, &s;uperior to its own Influence, Effects or Productions.</P>
<P>The Holy Spirit is not known, felt or di&s;cerned in his real Nature, by any <HI>Quaker</HI> or others, but <HI>only his Influence,</HI> Effects, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Therefore he cannot be in his own real Nature a Rule of Action to them, &s;uperior to his own Productions, Effects and Influ|ence.</P></Q>
<P>This demon&s;trates how void of Truth and Probability Logic may be in a &s;ophi&s;tical Hand. For, How &s;hould any Thing be a Rule &s;uperior to its Influence, when its Influ|ence is that by which it rules? And with what Propriety is its Influence, and the Effects and Productions of that Influence placed under the &s;ame Predicament? This Argument evidently in&s;inuates, 1. That the Influence of the Holy Spirit is no more of its real Nature, than the Works and Effects produced by it; which is
<PB N="147" REF="021391_0149_0FB36A74E98424B0">the &s;ame Thing as to &s;ay, The Influence of the Sun in the Firmament, that is, <HI>his Beams,</HI> which irradiate his di&s;tingui&s;hing Light, and &s;hed his animating Warmth, are no more of his real Nature, than the Wax he &s;oftens, or the Clay he hardens. 2. That the rational Soul feels and di&s;cerns the Influence of the Spirit, without any real Sen&s;e of the Nature of the Spirit. This appears to me ju&s;t as true, as that we &s;ee by the Light of the Sun, with|out any Perception of that Light, and are corporeally animated by its Warmth, without ever feeling it. 3. That if the e&s;&s;ential Ful|ne&s;s of the Divine Being do not come into immediate Contact with the Soul of Man, he cannot have any &s;en&s;ible Perception of God's Nature by his Divine Influence; which is like a&s;&s;erting, that the powerful Influence of the Sun cannot be &s;en&s;ibly perceived by a Man, unle&s;s the Body of the Sun immediately touch his Body.</P>
<P N="2">2. Having noted in my Ob&s;ervation, P. 14, 15, from <HI>John</HI> v. 39, that the Phari&s;ees re&s;ted upon the Scriptures, and would not apply to Chri&s;t, my Opponent an&s;wers, P. 11. <Q>Our Saviour, however, &s;eems to give a different Account of the Matter; for he frequently tells them, <HI>Mat.</HI> xv. 6. <HI>Mark</HI> vii. 13. that they made the Word of God of none Effect, through their Traditions; how then could they be &s;aid to re&s;t upon it?</Q> An&s;w. The Rea&s;on our Saviour gives, why they &s;hould, or did &s;earch the Scriptures, is, For, in them "ye think ye have eternal Life." If <HI>they thought</HI> to have eternal Life in the Scriptures, they certainly, in that Sen&s;e, <HI>re&s;ted upon them</HI>
<PB N="148" REF="021391_0150_0FB36A7662954968">for it, and not upon Chri&s;t, the only Saviour, to whom they would not come that they might have it. As to their making the Word, or Command of God, of none Effect through their Traditions, that was &s;poken at a different Time, and appears not to relate to the Object of their Dependence for eternal Life, therefore cannot either with Propriety or Prudence, be urged in Contradiction to what he here a&s;&s;erted. The Text, I apprehend, may be thus under|&s;tood. <HI>Search,</HI> or rather, <HI>ye &s;earch the Scrip|tures, for in them ye think ye have eternal Life.</HI> You think &s;o, but are mi&s;taken, for they are not the Life, but come from the Life, <HI>and they are they which te&s;tify of me,</HI> who am the Life; yet ye &s;tick in them as your Life, <HI>and ye will not come to me,</HI> the Life, <HI>that ye might have Life;</HI> therefore, notwith&s;tanding your Depen|dence upon the Scriptures, ye remain in a State of Death, re&s;ting upon the Letter only, with|out the Knowledge of the Spirit.</P>
<P N="3">3. P. 12. <HI>S. N.</HI> &s;ays, <Q>It de&s;erves to be particularly noted, that our Lord never once blames them for not attending to the <HI>Light within.</HI></Q> I think, it merits more particullar Notice, that if he doth not blame them <HI>in Terminis,</HI>* for not attending to it, he does more, by &s;hewing them the Condemnation that accrues to tho&s;e who neglect it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">John iii. 19-21.</NOTE> <Q>This is <HI>the Condemnation,</HI> that Light is come into the World, and <HI>Men loved Darkne&s;s rather than Light;</HI> becau&s;e their Deeds <HI>were Evil.</HI> For <HI>every One,</HI> that doth Evil <HI>hateth the Light, neither cometh to the Light,</HI> le&s;t his Deeds &s;hould be reproved.

<P>The <HI>Light</HI> of God <HI>&s;hining in the Heart,</HI> is certainly <HI>a Light within,</HI> and this Light comes in the Face, or Appearance, of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which Appearance therefore, <HI>mu&s;t be within,</HI> and ought in Duty to be attended to.</P>
<P N="4">4. Ibid.

<P>If to perfect the Man of God, and to change the corrupt Sinner into a Man of God, be the &s;ame Thing; or, if the Man of God, and the &s;inful Man; the Regenerate, and the Unre|generate; the Prophet. and the Profligate; be One and the &s;ame, the Apo&s;tle &s;aith it; but if they are not &s;o, <HI>he a&s;&s;erts no &s;uch Thing.</HI>

<P>The Law &s;aith, Do, or avoid this, and live. The Go&s;pel not only forbids the outward Act, but al&s;o re&s;trains the inward De&s;ire and Motion towards it. The Law &s;aith, Thou &s;halt not kill; nor commit Adultery; nor for&s;wear thy|&s;elf, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Go&s;pel commands, Give not Place to Anger; thou &s;halt not lu&s;t; &s;wear not at all, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In this Manner, the Go&s;pel de&s;troys not the moral Law, but fulfils it, by taking away the Ground of &s;inful Acts, and laying the Axe of the Spirit to the Root of Corruption.</P>
<P>Can the Con&s;iderate imagine, that the ever|la&s;ting Source of Wi&s;dom and Might, can be at a Lo&s;s how to expel Satan's Kingdom in Man whil&s;t upon Earth?

Is it not more to his Glory to deliver from the Power of Evil, and to &s;ave both from Sin here, and Mi&s;ery hereafter, than to &s;ave only from Wretchedne&s;s in Futurity? Is a Part greater than the Whole? Or, is an incomplete Deliverance preferable, or more glorious than that which is perfect?</P>
<P>When Doctrines oppo&s;ite to Purification of Heart, and Holine&s;s of Life, are indu&s;triou&s;ly propagated, it &s;tands every One in hand to be

<P N="5">5. The Ability in the Scriptures, as before cited, to enlarge the Man of God in &s;aving Wi&s;dom, the Apo&s;tle &s;aith, is <HI>through Faith which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. S.

<P>What true Go&s;pel-Faith is, let us a little con&s;ider. As the Entrance of the Divine Word quickeneth the Soul, &s;o it fir&s;t commu|nicates a Degree of Faith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. xii. 9, and Col. ii. 12.</NOTE> through which it operates; for true Faith is <HI>the Gift of God,</HI> and the Holy Spirit is <HI>the Spirit of Faith;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. iv. 13.</NOTE> which is not a bare Belief of Truths concern|ing Chri&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Tim. iii. 17.</NOTE> but a Faith <HI>in him.</HI> The Faith <HI>in Chri&s;t</HI> is not compri&s;ed in giving Credit to Narrations and Doctrines, and a Mode of Prac|tice framed by the Wi&s;dom of Men upon it; for that centers &s;hort of the e&s;&s;ential Sub&s;tance of Faith. Go&s;pel-Faith in Man believes the Truth of all that is revealed by the Spirit, both in the Heart, and in the Sacred Writings; becau&s;e it feels it, &s;avours it, and is one with it. It not only <HI>a&s;&s;ents to</HI> the &s;criptural Accounts of the Incarnation and whole Proce&s;s of Chri&s;t in <HI>Judea;</HI> but it al&s;o <HI>receives</HI> his internal Appearance, <HI>con&s;ents to</HI> his Operation, and <HI>concurs</HI> with it.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="021391_0157_0FB36A8C1F8A14D8">
That Faith which &s;tands wholly upon Hear|&s;ay, Tradition, Reading, or Imagination, is but a di&s;tant Kind of ineffectual Credence, which permits the Soul to remain in the Bondage of Corruption. The Wicked may go this Length towards Go&s;pel-Faith; but the true Faith lays hold of, and cleaves to the Spirit of Truth, in its inward Manife&s;tations, wherein it &s;tands, and whereby it grows, till the Heart is purified, the World overcome, and Salvation obtained.</P>
<P>This Faith is as a Flame of pure Love in the Heart to God. It pre&s;&s;eth towards him, panteth after him, re&s;igns to him, confides and lives in him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. iii. 9.</NOTE> The <HI>My&s;tery of it is held in a pure Con&s;cience,</HI> and in the effective Power of the Everla&s;ting Go&s;pel; whence <HI>the Chri&s;tian Di&s;pen&s;ation</HI> in Holy Writ, is often di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from the exterior Di&s;pen&s;ation of the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Law, and the prior Admini&s;tration of Angels in vi&s;ible Appearances, by the Appel|lation of FAITH.</P>
<P>Though the Term Faith is occa&s;ionally u&s;ed by the Pen-men of Scripture in divers, yet not contrary, but con&s;i&s;tent Sen&s;es, this &s;eems to be the <HI>One</HI> &s;tanding Faith mentioned, <HI>Eph.</HI> iv. 5. which <HI>is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> as it is the Fruit of his Grace and good Spirit in the Heart.

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. S. N. &s;ays, P. 14. <Q>No more than what <HI>we a&s;&s;ert of the Ability of Scripture</HI> have the Apologi&s;t or his Defenders &s;aid of the Light within.</Q> It may be &s;o; but where is the Proof of this, that him&s;elf and his Coad|jutors a&s;&s;ert concerning the <HI>&s;aving Ability</HI> of the Scriptures? Why thus it follows. <Q><HI>We al&s;o &s;ay,</HI> the Scriptures will make us wi&s;e unto Salvation, if we attend to the Sen&s;e of them, believe it, and <HI>&s;o</HI> become influenced by it, therefore <HI>they are able to &s;ave.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I have already &s;hewn, that <HI>he mi&s;takes the Sen&s;e</HI> of the Text above-mentioned, which is
<PB N="157" REF="021391_0159_0FB36A90AE31E1C8">not the only One by many, how then &s;hould he <HI>attend to, believe,</HI> and be <HI>influenced</HI> by the Sen&s;e who has it not? And, how &s;hould he be &s;aved by the Sen&s;e of that he does not under|&s;tand? I hope his Salvation will be better founded than his Argument; for this hath no firmer Ba&s;is than bare A&s;&s;ertion. <Q><HI>We &s;ay,</HI> the Scriptures, &amp;c.</Q> <HI>therefore</HI> they are able to &s;ave. But I have &s;aid enough before to this Point.</P>
<P N="2">2. P. 15. He reminds me, that the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> plead, <Q>The Scriptures are not the &s;upreme Guide; for they do not an&s;wer the End, that is, the reconciling of Differences; for tho&s;e who pretend mo&s;t to con&s;ult the Scrip|tures, do mo&s;t of all di&s;agree in Matters of Faith, and in their Interpretation of the Scripture.</Q></P>
<P>No Prote&s;tant of a &s;ound Under&s;tanding can deny the Truth of this; for more religious Differences have ari&s;en, and &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;t, about the Sen&s;e of Scripture, than any Thing el&s;e. There is therefore Need of an infallible Inter|preter; which is <HI>the Spirit of Truth,</HI> whence they came, and who is mea&s;urably given <HI>to guide into all Truth.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">John xvi. 13.</NOTE> The Error of the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> &s;tands not in a&s;&s;erting the undeniable Diver&s;ities among&s;t Men, concerning the Sen&s;e of Scrip|ture, but in &s;etting up a vi&s;ible carnal Head, in&s;tead of the invi&s;ible &s;piritual Head of the Church; a Succe&s;&s;ion of fallible Men, under the Pretence of their being infallibly impowered, officially and finally to determine Doctrines for, and direct the Con&s;ciences of all others; and the&s;e who approach the neare&s;t to this Part of <HI>Popery,</HI> are &s;uch as pretend their own private,

<P N="3">3. P. 18. <HI>S. N.</HI> expre&s;&s;es an Imagination, that <HI>Barclay</HI> meant by <HI>Right Rea&s;on,</HI> <Q>not the Faculty of the Under&s;tanding it&s;elf, but that Rea&s;oning or Argument which is con|formable to <HI>the true Relation of Things.</HI></Q> I mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e him to intend here, <HI>the true Relation of &s;piritual Things;</HI> for tho&s;e are what we have here to do with. But what will this avail him? By what Means will he a&s;&s;ure us, that his Under&s;tanding is adequate to <HI>this Relation,</HI> and to what is, or is not conformable to it? Spiritual Things are the Things of God, and &s;aith Holy Writ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. ii. 11.</NOTE> <Q>The Things of God knoweth no Man, but the Spirit of God;</Q> therefore the Apo&s;tle declares,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ver&s;e 12.</NOTE> <Q>We have received, not the Spirit of the World, but the Spirit which is of God; that <HI>we might know</HI> the Things that are freely given to us of God.</Q><Q><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ver&s;e 14.</NOTE>&mdash;But the natural Man <HI>receiveth not</HI> the Things of the Spirit of God, for <HI>they are Fooli&s;hne&s;s unto him; neither can he know them,</HI> becau&s;e they are &s;piritually di&s;cerned.</Q> Hence it is clear, that he who hath not the Knowledge of &s;piritual Things, by the Mani|fe&s;tation of the Spirit of God, hath not the true Knowledge of them, imagine what he will of his other Acquirements; and he mu&s;t find him&s;elf at la&s;t upon the &s;andy Foundation of vain Opinion.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle follows this by a&s;&s;erting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ver&s;e 15.</NOTE> <Q>The &s;piritual Man judgeth all Things.</Q> That is, the Man who is rendered &s;piritual, by the renewing Induence of the Holy Spirit, has,
<PB N="159" REF="021391_0161_0FB36A96CEDBD928">through the Shining of Divine Light upon his Mind, a clear Di&s;cerning of all tho&s;e &s;piritual Matters it concerns him to know; which it is impo&s;&s;ible for the natural Man rightly to com|prehend.</P>
<P N="4">4. P. 21. <Q>The Apologi&s;t has Recour&s;e to the Scriptures, to prove to us the Nece&s;&s;ity of immediate In&s;piration for all Per&s;ons, but when he will convince us of the Truth and Certainty of the Scriptures, he turns back again to his peculiar Notion of the Revela|tion of the Spirit in every Man.</Q> Strange Logic indeed!</P>
<P>What Conclu&s;ion is more natural, than to determine what a Tree is by its Fruit; or what the Fruit is by the Tree? Men do not gather Grapes off Thorns, nor Figs off Thi&s;|tles; but when they &s;ee a Fig-tree, they know its Fruit mu&s;t be Figs; and when they &s;ee a Grape, they know it to be the Fruit of the Vine. In this Manner the Holy Spirit and the Scriptures, where both are known, bear mutual Te&s;timony to each other, by a Demon|&s;tration above all Logic, and out of the Reach of Sophi&s;try. What <HI>Barclay,</HI> therefore, urges in this Ca&s;e, is the reciprocal Te&s;timony of the Spirit with the Scriptures, as the cleare&s;t and be&s;t Convincement of both to the Mind of Man, and this not &s;o much by Way of Argument to the Head, as Appeal to the Con&s;cience.</P>
<P N="5">5. P. 22. Our Opponent falls upon <HI>George Fox,</HI> whom he repre&s;ents in no very candid Manner. He takes upon him to contradict tho&s;e concerning him, who for many Years were per&s;onally acquainted with him, and his
<PB N="160" REF="021391_0162_0FB36A98241A10C0">Conduct, and who, both from the Opportu|nities they had, and the Abilities they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, were much better Judges both of the Man, and the Reality of the Facts, than he can po&s;&s;ibly be. What he calls his <HI>fair and ju&s;t Examination,</HI> is a mere Train of Invective and Abu&s;e, relating to Matters tran&s;acted long before he was born into the World; and which his notorious Prejudice renders him unfit to determine upon. Having pur&s;ued <HI>George Fox</HI> with great Warmth, through eight or nine Pages, and &s;ufficiently heated his Spirits, he fa&s;tens upon his &s;ingular Concern at <HI>Litchjield,</HI> in 1651. Upon which I &s;hall drop the fol|lowing Ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>It has plea&s;ed the Divine Being at Times, to require Things of his devoted Servants, which mu&s;t appear <HI>very fooli&s;h</HI> to the Wi&s;dom of the World;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. i. 27.</NOTE> but <Q>he hath cho&s;en <HI>the fooli&s;h Things</HI> of the World to confound the Wi&s;e.</Q> Might not &s;uch an Act as this &s;imply related by <HI>George Fox,</HI> be required of him, in Part, to try, or to give him an Opportunity of exer|ci&s;ing, his Faith and Obedience, and al&s;o to alarm a People too &s;ecure in fal&s;e Re&s;ts, and carnal Indulgences? He repre&s;ents the Appre|hen&s;ion he had of it, was to <HI>revive the Memo|rial of their Predece&s;&s;ors, and their deep Sufferings for the Cau&s;e of Chri&s;t;</HI> which, in Divine Wi&s;dom, might be proper to a Generation immer&s;ed in a State of Degeneracy, and For|getfulne&s;s of God, and to &s;hew them the Woe that would attend a Continuance in a degenerate Life and Practice. With the &s;ame View, Woes have been pronounced by divers of God's in&s;pired Me&s;&s;engers, as we read in Scripture,
<PB N="161" REF="021391_0163_0FB36A999EFDAF70">and what mighty Hurt or Scandal accrued from this, that it mu&s;t be interpreted in the wor&s;t Sen&s;e po&s;&s;ible to be put upon it? What but Ignorance, or an invidious and malevolent Di&s;po&s;ition, would &s;ee nothing el&s;e in the Ca&s;e, but <HI>arrant Villainy, rank Enthu&s;ia&s;m, gro&s;s and melancholy Fanatici&s;m, loquacious Lunacy, and diabolical Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion?</HI></P>
<P>If <HI>G. Fox</HI> had from a Divine Impul&s;e, found it his Concern <HI>to go naked</HI> for three Years together, as the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> did;<NOTE PLACE="marg">I&s;ai. xx.</NOTE> or <HI>to lay Siege to a Tile,</HI> in a cumbent Po&s;ture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezek. iv.</NOTE> and bake his Bread with Dung, for the Space of fifteen Months, as <HI>Ezekiel</HI> did; it would as &s;urely have drawn down the Re&s;entment of <HI>S.

<P>With Re&s;pect to miraculous Te&s;timonials; when I con&s;ider the many gro&s;s Impo&s;itions of that Kind, under Names delivered down to us with great Veneration, and &s;ainted in the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church, I do not admire that thinking Per&s;ons, not &s;ufficiently experienced in the Divine Life, &s;hould be inclined to di&s;believe any modern Narratives of &s;upernatural Tokens. But this Difference is evidently ob&s;ervable, between the &s;ew related by <HI>George Fox,</HI> and his Friends, and the many by <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Writers. The&s;e indu&s;triou&s;ly propagated their miraculous Legends for a Name; for the Support of un|&s;criptural Super&s;tition, and &s;eparate Intere&s;ts, mona&s;tic In&s;titutions, the Adoration of Relicks, and of the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, the Invocation of Saints, real or nominal, Prayers for the De|parted, Image-wor&s;hip, their deified Sacra|ment, the formal Sign of the Cro&s;s, con&s;ecrated
<PB N="162" REF="021391_0164_0FB36A9F37305B60">Oil, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> But <HI>G. Fox</HI> never once pretended to a Power of working Miracles to the People where he came, to open a Door among&s;t them for the Reception of him&s;elf, or the Prin|ciples he &s;pread; nor was it nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould, &s;ince they had been already miracu|lou&s;ly atte&s;ted, in the fir&s;t planting of Chri&s;ti|anity. For, the Fundamentals he preached were, Chri&s;t once in the Fle&s;h, and always in Spirit, as the Light and Life of Men, the Mediator, the Propitiation, the Interce&s;&s;or, the potential and actual Redeemer, offered for all, and to all, and the e&s;pecial Saviour of all that believe in him &s;o as to obey him; with the Nece&s;&s;ity of Regeneration in Man, and the Practice of every Moral and Chri&s;tian Virtue.</P>
<P>Is it nothing extraordinary, that a Per&s;on &s;o ob&s;cure and illiterate, &s;o little conver&s;ant among&s;t Men, &s;o uneducated in Arts, Lan|guages and Sciences, &s;o unver&s;ed in the various Modes of Divinity, by Turns in Fa&s;hion, unin&s;tructed, unprovided, unprotected by Men, &s;hould &s;ingly and alone, launch into the trou|bled Sea of a tempe&s;tuous fluctuating World, and in direct Oppo&s;ition to all the Pride, Policy and Power of a learned and lucrative Prie&s;t|hood, and a prejudiced People with a bigotted Magi&s;tracy at their Head; that &s;uch an One, by the &s;imple Doctrine of the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, &s;hould be made in&s;trumental to the turning of Thou&s;ands, not from Form to Form, but from Darkne&s;s to Light; from the Power of Satan, to the Power of God; from a Death in Sin, to the Life of Righteou&s;ne&s;s; from habitual Vice, to a Cour&s;e of Virtue; in&s;o|much that &s;ome judicious Magi&s;trates declared,

In this great and good Work, <HI>G. Fox,</HI> with the People he had been in&s;trumental to rai&s;e, &s;tood with unabated Courage and Con&s;tancy, and were enabled, with undaunted Fortitude, to bear up again&s;t near forty Years cruel Per&s;e|cution, with &s;mall Intervals, both from royal and republican Parties, as each a&s;cended the Scale of national Power.

<P>Notwith&s;tanding the inviduous Mi&s;repre|&s;entations made concerning him, no Marks of In&s;incerity, Artifice or Impo&s;ture appeared in his Conduct, nor of Intere&s;t or Ambition in his Views.

Yet, as he was an u&s;eful, eminent, and honourable Member of our religious Body, we are not unconcerned in his Veracity, and therefore require better Proofs again&s;t it than the Surmi&s;es, Pre&s;umptions, and Di&s;gui&s;es of Prejudice. What he relates of the Facts, he a&s;&s;erts upon his own Knowledge of them, and divers are witne&s;&s;ed to by others as well as him&s;elf. Can <HI>S.

Lucre, Preferment, the Avoidance of Di&s;ad|vantage, Di&s;tre&s;s, or Abu&s;e, have operated upon the Hopes and Fears of many; but never appeared to have &s;haken, or weighed with him. Such was the Strength of his Faith, and the internal Support which attended him. He was no Sect-ma&s;ter. He &s;ought neither exter|nal Benefits, nor the Honour that is from below. He traded not in Religion. He truckled not to the corrupt Humours or Di&s;|po&s;itions of any. He called the People out of that Apo&s;tacy from the Holy Spirit of God they were too generally &s;unk into, and out of tho&s;e carnal Ordinances which could not truly profit them, nor contribute to Renovation of

Neither did him&s;elf, nor tho&s;e who became connected with him, divide from others for Separation-&s;ake, but to join together in fol|lowing <HI>the One Everla&s;ting Shepherd</HI> of the true Sheep. To <HI>him</HI> they gathered, and in the Life and Love of the Go&s;pel, became united to him in Spirit, as <HI>their only Head,</HI> and one to another as Brethren.

<P>It is too probable from the Sacred Writings to be denied, that the Almighty, both before the In&s;titution of the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Law, and during its Continuance, all along, at Sea&s;ons, occa|&s;ionally manife&s;ted apparent Tokens of his &s;upernatural Power, through tho&s;e he parti|cularly concerned to hold up the Mirror of true Religion in its genuine Purity, and to revive and re&s;tore it when lo&s;t, or to a great Degree ob&s;cured among&s;t its Profe&s;&s;ors; and why &s;hould it appear an Ab&s;urdity to &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;ince the primitive Age of Chri&s;tianity, he &s;hould &s;ee fit &s;ometimes on like Occa&s;ions, to add Sanctions of like Nature?

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. S. N. in his Letter, Page 9, indirectly in&s;inuated, that the <HI>Quakers read more, and form their Sentiments more</HI> from the Apology than the New Te&s;tament. Knowing this to be untrue, I denied it of the Generality of that People, and queried with him, <Q>If he intended it of particular Per&s;ons, who are they?</Q> In An&s;wer to this Que&s;tion, P. 47, he now a&s;&s;umes the Charge of <HI>Nathan</HI> upon <HI>David,</HI> and roundly a&s;&s;erts to me, <Q>thou art the Man.</Q> But how I &s;hould be the Man he meant when he penned that Sugge&s;tion, is my&s;terious to me, &s;eeing <HI>then</HI> he certainly was
<PB N="168" REF="021391_0170_0FB36AADBB861D08">perfectly unacquainted with me. But it &s;eems, for Want of another, I mu&s;t be the Man, becau&s;e <HI>he can't help thinking,</HI> P. 46, that I a&s;&s;ert or in&s;inuate, 1. <Q>What <HI>the Apo&s;tles</HI> have &s;poken and written is not the Go&s;pel." 2. That <HI>the real Meaning</HI> of their Writings is <HI>only a dry Theory.</HI>" 3. That the Go&s;pel in Fact is <HI>an inexplicable Sub&s;tane</HI> within all Men, whether they know any Thing of the Character and Redemption of Chri&s;t, as repre&s;ented in the New Te&s;tament, or not." 4. That <HI>the Whole</HI> of our Salvation <HI>depends &s;olely</HI> upon an inward Power and Virtue, without <HI>the Influence of the in&s;pired Senti|ments</HI> of the Book of God.</Q></P>
<P>If I may be allowed to &s;peak my own Sen&s;e, what I have a&s;&s;erted, and do believe, re&s;pecting the&s;e Points, is, 1. That the evan|gelic and apo&s;tolic Writings are <HI>de&s;criptive and declarative</HI> of the Go&s;pel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. i. 16.</NOTE> which <HI>therein</HI> is defined to be <HI>the Power of God unto Salva|tion;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. i. 24.</NOTE> that <HI>Chri&s;t is the Power of God,</HI> who &s;piritually and internally admini&s;ters Light and Life to the Souls of Men, which <HI>&s;piritual and powerful Admini&s;tration,</HI> is the <HI>e&s;&s;ential Go&s;pel;</HI> and that, both tho&s;e Parts of Scripture, which bear Te&s;timony to the Incarnation and outward Proce&s;s of Chri&s;t, and tho&s;e that witne&s;s to his inward Mini&s;tration in Spirit, whether narrative or doctrinal, being the be&s;t and mo&s;t eminent <HI>written Te&s;tifications</HI> of the Go&s;pel, are therefore, by a Metonymy, u&s;ually called by its Name.</P>
<P N="2">2. In my Ob&s;ervations, from P. 36 to 43, I fully made appear, that <HI>the real Meaning</HI> of the apo&s;tolic Writings is <HI>not a dry Theory,</HI> but
<PB N="169" REF="021391_0171_0FB36AB021C14028">a &s;trong Recommendation of the living and &s;en&s;ible Operation of the Power of God.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Reader may &s;ee in my An&s;wers to the fir&s;t of the&s;e Articles, and other Parts of this Treati&s;e, that <HI>I do not hold the Go&s;pel to be in Fact an inexplicable Sub&s;tance,</HI> &amp;c. But that it is not to be truly and certainly known without Divine Illumination; for,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. ii. 11.</NOTE> <Q>The Things of God knoweth no Man, but the Spirit of God.</Q> We read,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Tim. i. 10.</NOTE> that <Q>Life and Immortality are brought to Light by the Go&s;pel.</Q> But what is this Life and Im|mortality? Did not Mankind believe in a future State, before the Incarnation of Chri&s;t? Yes, certainly: Both Jews and Gentiles believed and held the Truth of it. What Life and Immortality then is that which is <HI>peculiar to the Go&s;pel,</HI> and which it is <HI>its particular Pro|perty to unvail?</HI> It con&s;i&s;ts not wholly in the Relation of the external Procedure and Doctrines of our Lord, but mainly in that &s;piritual Gift he procured for us through his Sufferings, which is <HI>the Life and Power</HI> that the immortal Spirit of God manife&s;ts in the believing and obedient Soul, that Spirit which quickens tho&s;e who have been dead in Tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es and Sins,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ephe&s;. iv. 18.</NOTE> and <HI>therein alienated from the Life of God.</HI> The very, E&s;&s;ence of the Go&s;pel, is the i&s;&s;uing forth of this Spirit of Life to the Hearts of Men.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. iv. 23.</NOTE> <Q>Keep thy Heart with all Diligence,</Q> &s;aith the wi&s;e Man, <Q>for out of it are <HI>the I&s;&s;ues of Life.</HI></Q> This teacheth that <HI>the&s;e living I&s;&s;ues</HI> ari&s;e <HI>in</HI> the Heart of Man, but not <HI>from</HI> the Heart it&s;elf. Was it &s;o, the Heart or Soul would be its own Quickener and Saviour, and Chri&s;t would be excluded as
<PB N="170" REF="021391_0172_0FB36AB1E8C3EDA8">&s;uch;<NOTE PLACE="marg">John xiv. 6.</NOTE> but <HI>he</HI> alone <HI>is the Way, the Truth, and the Life,</HI> therefore the I&s;&s;uings of Life to the Heart are from the Spirit, and in and through it by his Spirit. The Divine Influence of it is the Life of the Soul, that which renders it living, and void of this, it cannot be in a Go&s;pel Sen&s;e, <HI>a living Soul.</HI> It may endure to Eternity; but mere Duration is not this Divine Life. To exi&s;t without this Life, is to be &s;cripturally dead; it is therefore requi&s;ite for the Soul to wait for, feel after, and find this immortal Life, and al&s;o to keep to it <HI>with all Diligence,</HI> that it may experience the daily <HI>I&s;&s;ues</HI> thereof to its Comfort and Pre&s;ervation, and to be as <Q>a Well of Water &s;pringing up into everla&s;ting Life.</Q><NOTE PLACE="marg">John iv. 14.</NOTE></P>
<P N="4">4. The Pretence that I a&s;&s;ert, the Salvation of tho&s;e who have the Privilege of peru&s;ing the Scriptures, depends <HI>&s;olely</HI> upon an inward Power and Virtue, without tho&s;e as a Means, is no A&s;&s;ertion of mine; for my Words plainly indicate the contrary. I &s;ay, P. 14, <Q>We <HI>do not pretend,</HI> that the internal Motion of the Spirit <HI>is the only Means</HI> of Reformation and Religion, to tho&s;e who are likewi&s;e favoured with the Scriptures; but highly prize, thankfully accept, and u&s;e them as the <HI>be&s;t &s;econdary Means extant.</HI></Q> I al&s;o under|&s;tand the propitiatory Sacrifice of our Saviour, by which he opens the Door of Reconciliation for us, to be the initiatory Part of Man's Sal|vation, and the internal Work of Regeneration by his Spirit, to be its actual Completion; for thereby an Entrance is admini&s;tered into the Heavenly Kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="021391_0173_0FB36AB59987B4A0">
La&s;tly, no Man can have <HI>the Influence of the in&s;pired Sentiments</HI> of the Book of God, with|out <HI>receiving tho&s;e in&s;pired Sentiments,</HI> which I have &s;ufficiently &s;hewn, no Man hath who reads without the in&s;piring Power.

<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The <HI>Quakers</HI> neither read the Scriptures, nor any Thing el&s;e, during the Time of their Wor&s;hip, or as a Part of it, but after that is over, they u&s;ually once in the Year, take the Opportunity, before the Congregation &s;eparate, to read tho&s;e &s;hort Informations and Advices which are tran&s;mitted from the Yearly-meeting in <HI>London.</HI> The&s;e Advices always con&s;i&s;t of Scripture-quotations, and Doctrines agreeable to Scripture, according to the be&s;t of their Knowledge; but the reading of them is no more a Part of their Wor&s;hip, than the reading Te&s;timonies of Denial again&s;t immoral Mem|bers,
<PB N="172" REF="021391_0174_0FB36AB740EF1708">or the Sub&s;tance of Brie&s;s recommended by the Crown, at &s;uch Opportunities.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. They give &s;uch Preference to the Scrip|tures above all other Writings, that they &s;trictly pre&s;s the frequent reading of them, and call for An&s;wers at every Quarterly-meeting throughout the Society, and at the general Yearly-meeting in <HI>London</HI> from every parti|cular Quarterly-meeting, whether the Holy Scriptures are con&s;tantly read in their Families, or not; which they neither do, nor ever did, re&s;pecting any of their own Writings, or any others.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The Society doth occa&s;ionally pre&s;ent, or recommend &s;uch of their Books as they think proper to give Information concerning their Principles, to obviate the Prejudices conceived, and indu&s;triou&s;ly propagated again&s;t them; which they apprehend, they have as much Right to do, as their Adver&s;aries have to mi&s;|repre&s;ent and calumniate them; and indeed, the Abu&s;es of tho&s;e are &s;ufficient to oblige them to this Practice.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. They do recommend Silence and Still|ne&s;s in their religious A&s;&s;emblies; and as our Manner of Wor&s;hip is mi&s;under&s;tood by many, and often treated with Ridicule, I &s;hall take this Opportunity to offer &s;ome Explanation of it.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>We look upon Divine Wor&s;hip to be the mo&s;t &s;olemn Act the Mind of Man is capable of being engaged in; and in Con&s;ideration of the high and inconceivable Maje&s;ty of Almighty God, think it our Duty to approach him with the greate&s;t Reverence. Every thinking Per|&s;on, who is in any Degree &s;en&s;ible of the Love
<PB N="173" REF="021391_0175_0FB36AB925714420">and Fear of God, mu&s;t e&s;teem it an awful Thing, to pre&s;ent him&s;elf to the e&s;pecial Notice of the Infinite Omnipre&s;ent Eternal Being. Under a Sen&s;e of this, the wife Man advi&s;eth, <Q>Keep thy Foot when thou goe&s;t to the Hou&s;e of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecle&s;. v. 1.</NOTE></Q> (or enters upon Wor&s;hip) <Q>and be more ready to hear, than to give the Sacrifice of Fools; for they con&s;ider not that they do Evil. <HI>Be not ra&s;h with thy Mouth,</HI> and <HI>let not thine Heart be ha&s;ty to utter any Thing before God;</HI> for God is in Heaven, and thou upon Earth, therefore let thy Words be few.</Q> He well knew, as he expre&s;&s;es it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. xvi. 1.</NOTE> that both <Q><HI>The Preparation of the Heart,</HI> and <HI>the An&s;wer of the Tongue</HI> is from the Lord.</Q> This accords with what our Saviour &s;aith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">John xv. 5.</NOTE> <Q>Without me ye can do nothing.</Q> We, therefore, cannot perform Divine Wor&s;hip acceptably but by his A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. This mu&s;t be received in Spirit; for, &s;aith the Apo&s;tle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. viii. 26.</NOTE> <Q>The Spirit al&s;o helpeth our Infirmities; for <HI>we know not what we &s;hould pray for as we ought.</HI></Q> This being as certainly our Ca&s;e, as it was that of the Apo&s;|tles and primitive Believers, it is incumbent on us to wait for that Spirit which is requi&s;ite to help our Infirmities, in order to pray as we ought. No Forms of Devotion of Mens Invention can &s;upply the Place of the Spirit. The &s;ame Apo&s;tle further &s;aith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. ii. 18.</NOTE> <Q>Through him we both <HI>have an Acce&s;s, by one Spirit</HI> unto the Father.</Q> Seeing therefore, that both our <HI>Help</HI> and <HI>Acce&s;s</HI> is through the Spirit of Chri&s;t, the Renewal of which is at his Plea&s;ure, and not ours, we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily wait for it. This Waiting mu&s;t be in <HI>Still|ne&s;s
<PB N="174" REF="021391_0176_0FB36ABAC946B5C8">of Mind</HI> from the common Cour&s;e of our own Thoughts, from all wandering Imagina|tions, and al&s;o in <HI>Silence</HI> from the Expre&s;&s;ion of Words; for the Utterance of Words is not <HI>waiting,</HI> but acting.</P>
<P>Words are requi&s;ite to convey the Sen&s;e of one Per&s;on to another, but not to that Omni&s;ci|ent Being, who is an univer&s;al Spirit, and every where Almighty, who therefore &s;tands not in Need, either of the U&s;e of corporeal Organs, In&s;truments, or the Sound of Words, to com|municate with the Spirit of Man.</P>
<P>If, in order to wor&s;hip, the Mind do not &s;ettle into Stillne&s;s, the Pa&s;&s;ions will be at work, and may agitate it into enthu&s;ia&s;tic Heats, and vague Imaginations. But in true Stillne&s;s, and Singlene&s;s of Soul towards God, they are &s;ilenced and &s;ubjected. The &s;till &s;mall Voice of the In&s;pirer of all Good then comes to be heard, and the Mind being clo&s;ely engaged in Attention thereunto, and an&s;wering it in Faith and humble Submi&s;&s;ion, feels Divine Life and Love &s;pring up, and receives Ability therein, truly to wor&s;hip the great Author of its Exi&s;tence, and Heavenly Supplier of its Wants, with a Devotion no Forms can reach.</P>
<P>This Wor&s;hip is not entered upon by totally laying a&s;ide our Faculties, and falling into a &s;en&s;ele&s;s Stupor, as &s;uperficial Ob&s;ervers have imagined, but by a real Introver&s;ion of Mind, and an Attention fixed &s;ingly upon the alone Object of all Adoration, in patient, yet fer|vent De&s;ire after him. Thus, according to the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> the experienced P&s;almi&s;t advi&s;es, <Q><HI>Be &s;ilent to the Lord,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P&s;. xxxvii. 7.</NOTE> and wait patiently for him;" and re&s;pecting his own Practice, he

It is good for a Man that he bear the Yoke in his Youth. He &s;itteth alone, and <HI>keepeth Silence,</HI> becau&s;e he hath borne it upon him.</Q></P>
<P>Silent Waiting was in Practice among the Prophets, and tho&s;e that attended them, as appears in the Prophecy of <HI>Ezekiel.</HI> We find the Spirit of the Prophet was engaged in Divine Vi&s;ion, whil&s;t the Elders of <HI>Judah</HI> &s;ate before him, as it is de&s;cribed from the 1&s;t Ver&s;e of the viiith Chapter, to the 4th of the xith Chapter. During the Time of which Vi&s;ion, it cannot be con&s;i&s;tently &s;uppo&s;ed, that he was either &s;peaking to them, or they to him, or to each other. This was not a &s;ingular

<P>In this &s;olemn Practice, we have often been enabled thankfully to acknowledge, the Verity of that gracious Declaration of our Lord, <Q>Where Two or Three are gathered together in my Name,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. xviii. 20.</NOTE> there am I in the Mid&s;t of them;" the Fulfilling of that Promi&s;e.

<P>As &s;ilent Waiting appears to us, in the fir&s;t Place, requi&s;ite to the Wor&s;hip of God in Spirit and Truth, it is always our Practice, for we believe he ought to have the Direction of our Hearts therein; and if he plea&s;e to influence any One under due Preparation, vocally to appear, either by Way of Addre&s;s to him&s;elf in Prayer, or to us in Preaching, we never preclude &s;uch Appearances, but &s;ilently a&s;&s;i&s;t according to our Mea&s;ures. If it prove that none are &s;o concerned to &s;peak, we &s;it the Time through in Silence, wherein true mental Wor&s;hip is often experienced; but never appoint any Meeting with Intent, that it &s;hall be held throughout in Silence, as &s;ome have mi&s;takenly imagined; for we believe, that all ought to be led and guided by the good

<P>This appears intended to deceive the unwary Reader into a Notion, that in the preceding Remark. I have drawn a Reflection injurious to the Character of the Apo&s;tles, and to

<P N="6">6. Page 69 and 70, <HI>S.

<P><HI>Barclay</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hes Revelation into <HI>objec|tive</HI> and <HI>&s;ubjective,</HI> and &s;ometimes he &s;peaks of the one, and &s;ometimes of the other. In order to &s;hew the Propriety of this Di&s;tinction, let me ob&s;erve, that the Soul of Man hath not only a Faculty of Cogitation, by which it ordinarily thinks, unites, divides, compares, or forms Ideas, but al&s;o a <HI>latent Power</HI> of internal Sen&s;ation, or of perceiving Spiritual Objects by an inward and &s;piritual Sen&s;e, when pre|&s;ented through a proper Medium; which, till the Beams of Divine Light &s;hine upon it, it mu&s;t be as totally unacquainted with, as the Child in its Mother's Womb is with its Facul|ties of Sight and Hearing. For, though in that Situation, it may be completely formed,
<PB N="182" REF="021391_0184_0FB36AD2A4C1CA40">and po&s;&s;e&s;s every Organ proper to corporeal Sen&s;ation, yet it is not empowered <HI>to exerci&s;e them,</HI> or really <HI>to know</HI> it hath them, till it be brought forth into the Medium nece&s;&s;ary to the U&s;e of them, compo&s;ed of the Light and Air of this World. Then it fir&s;t finds the peculiar Sen&s;e, and Exerci&s;e of tho&s;e natural Powers which, before its Birth, it could not have the lea&s;t Under&s;tanding or proper U&s;e of. In like Manner, the natural Man mu&s;t be delivered out of his natural Darkne&s;s, into the luminous and quickening Influence of that Divine Word, or Spirit, which is mo&s;t em|phatically &s;tiled <HI>the true Light and Life of Men.</HI> Thus born of the Spirit, into this proper Medium of Divine Knowledge, the Soul is made acquainted with that &s;piritual Sen&s;e it could neither di&s;cover, nor believe pertained to it, whil&s;t in its natural State. This is no <HI>new natural Faculty</HI> added, but its own mental Power newly opened, and brought into its due Place and U&s;e.</P>
<P>Words are inadequate to the Expre&s;&s;ion of this internal Sen&s;e felt in the Soul under Divine Influence. It cannot be ideally conveyed to the Under&s;tanding of the Unexperienced; for it is not <HI>an Image,</HI> but <HI>a Sen&s;ation,</HI> impo&s;&s;ible to be conceived but by its own Impre&s;&s;ion. So true is that of the Apo&s;tle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. ii. 9, 10.</NOTE> <Q>Eye hath not &s;een, nor Ear heard, neither have entered into the Heart of Man, the Things which God hath prepared for them that love him; but God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit.</Q> It was upon this Con&s;ideration that I &s;aid, Divine Light is the Subject of inward Sen&s;ation, <Q>and is not to be commu|nicated
<PB N="183" REF="021391_0185_0FB36AD41E331FF8">from one to another by Rea&s;oning, or verbal De&s;cription.</Q> For, &s;hould any Per&s;on give the mo&s;t clear and lively De&s;crip|tion po&s;&s;ible of the Light of the Sun, to a Man blind from his Birth, it would only be communicating an <HI>ideal Notion</HI> of the Light, but not <HI>the Light it&s;elf.</HI> It might be called a &s;ubjective Revelation concerning the Light to him, but not an objective one of the Light it&s;elf. This no Man can have but by his own immediate Sen&s;ation.</P>
<P>Divine Revelation is a Di&s;clo&s;ure of &s;ome|thing to the rational Mind by the Holy Gho&s;t, not in the Mind's own Power to di&s;cover. This the Holy Spirit doth, either by unvailing of it&s;elf by its Influence in &s;ome Degree to the Soul, and giving it an internal Sen&s;e of its Pre&s;ence; or by favouring it with the Vi&s;ion of other Objects, real or repre&s;entative, through the Communication of Divine Light and Power; or by giving the Soul a clear Sen&s;e of its own State and Condition. All this being <HI>a Di&s;covery of Objects,</HI> is called <HI>objective Revelation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Subjective Revelation</HI> is a Di&s;clo&s;ure of <HI>Sub|jects,</HI> or Things relative, through the In&s;pi|ration of the Holy Spirit; by which the Mind is opened into the Knowledge of the Divine Will concerning Per&s;ons or Things, led into the true Sen&s;e of Scriptures, or into a deeper Under&s;tanding of Doctrines than it could ever reach without Divine Illumination. Of this Kind was the original Revelation of the Scrip|tures to tho&s;e who penned them.</P>
<P>All this, both objective and &s;ubjective, is truly internal immediate Revelation. What
<PB N="184" REF="021391_0186_0FB36ADA98058940">is now modi&s;hly treated as the only Revelation &s;till exi&s;ting, and to exi&s;t, is rather the Fruit of Revelation than the Thing it&s;elf, a &s;crip|tural Record of Things revealed; for they certainly were &s;o to tho&s;e to whom they were immediately di&s;clo&s;ed; but the different Sen&s;es put upon the many di&s;puted Parts of them, for many Generations pa&s;t, demon&s;trate tho&s;e Parts are not truly a Revelation to tho&s;e who mi&s;take them; nor can they ever become &s;uch to them, till they know the Holy Author to be their Interpreter.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. i. 20, 21.</NOTE> For, <Q>No Prophecy of Scripture is of any <HI>private Interpretation.</HI> For the Prophecy came not in old Time," or rather, at any Time, "by the Will of Man, but Holy Men of God &s;pake as they were moved by the Holy Gho&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>P. 75 and 76, <HI>S. N.</HI> argues, that the imme|diate internal Revelation of the Holy Gho&s;t <HI>is not</HI> in all <HI>&s;ufficient to &s;ave,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>Barclay</HI> allows, that &s;ome who have once had it, may be, and have been damned; to which I an&s;wer, if all were &s;aved, it would be a certain Proof that God is able to &s;ave all, but are we there|fore warranted to deny or di&s;pute <HI>the Ability</HI> of Almighty Power to &s;ave all, becau&s;e all are not &s;aved? A flowing Spring is certainly <HI>&s;ufficient</HI> to quench my Thir&s;t, if I drink <HI>&s;ufficiently</HI> of it; but if I refu&s;e, the <HI>In&s;uffici|ency</HI> is not in the Spring, but entirely owing to my Refu&s;al. But <HI>Balaam</HI> is adduced as an In&s;tance <HI>quite in Point;</HI> becau&s;e he had internal Revelation, yet taught <HI>Balak</HI> to &s;educe the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> to &s;in. That he &s;ometimes had inter|nal Revelation, is true, and whil&s;t he adhered thereunto, it pre&s;erved him from teaching
<PB N="185" REF="021391_0187_0FB36ADC659B9040">Seduction. It was when he departed from it, or &s;uffered him&s;elf to be &s;o far overcome with <HI>a Love to the Wages of Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Pet. ii. 15, and Jude 11.</NOTE> that the Holy Spirit departed from him, as an Illumi|minator and Pre&s;erver, that he joined <HI>Balak</HI> in his evil Purpo&s;es.

<P>The In&s;tances I adduced from the <HI>Pagans,</HI> were to &s;hew, that it was evident from &s;ome of their own Expre&s;&s;ions, they had an internal Sen&s;e of that <HI>Grace of God</HI> which the Apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>brings Salvation,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tit.ii. 11.</NOTE> <HI>and hath appeared to all Men.</HI> The Citations I made, appear to me Proofs of it.

The Divine Principle it&s;elf is our Bond of Union, and the Holy Scriptures are our Articles. Chri&s;t once in the Fle&s;h, and always in Spi|rit, are Fundamentals with us.

<P>As to Differences in Opinion among&s;t us; whil&s;t Profe&s;&s;ors of the &s;ame Faith differ in Years and Experience, in Capacity and Oppor|tunity, in Education and A&s;&s;ociates, in Faith|fulne&s;s or Unfaithfulne&s;s to their Principles, there mu&s;t be different Opinions and Practices.

If he think &s;o unfavourably of this Doctrine, what does he teach others to think of his favourite Doctrine of <HI>Preterition,</HI> which allows of <HI>no Condition,</HI> or <HI>Time of Vi&s;itation-at all,</HI> nor even <HI>one &s;ingle Chance</HI> for Salvation, to the Majority of Mankind?</P>
<P>That there is &s;uch a Time and Opportunity as <HI>Barclay</HI> inculcates, and that it may be lo&s;t to Apo&s;tatizers pa&s;t Redemption, is evident from that awful Pa&s;&s;age, <HI>Heb.</HI> vi. 4, 5, 6. <Q>It is impo&s;&s;ible for tho&s;e <HI>who were once enligh|tened,</HI> and have <HI>ta&s;ted</HI> of the Heavenly Gift, and were made <HI>Partakers</HI> of the Holy Gho&s;t, and have <HI>ta&s;ted</HI> of the <HI>good Word</HI> of God, and <HI>the Powers</HI> of the World to come; if <HI>they &s;hall fall away, to renew them again unto Repentance;</HI> &s;eeing they crucify to them|&s;elves the Son of God afre&s;h, and put him to an open Shame.</Q></P>
<P>This Pa&s;&s;age evinces, 1&s;t. that Per&s;ons may become &s;en&s;ible Partakers of the Holy Gho&s;t, and ta&s;te of that Divine Power which is the eternal Life of the Ble&s;&s;ed in the World to come. 2d. That they may apo&s;tatize from this Condition to &s;uch a Degree, that Repentance, and con&s;equently Salvation, &s;hall become impo&s;&s;ible to them. 3d. That they bring this upon them&s;elves, becau&s;e they cru|cify to them&s;elves the Son of God afre&s;h, and put him to an open Shame; they reject and rebel

This is further illu&s;trated by a Simile in the two &s;ucceeding Ver&s;es.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. vi. 7 and 8.</NOTE> <Q>For the Earth which drinketh in the Rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth Herbs meet for them by whom it is dre&s;&s;ed, receiveth Ble&s;&s;ing from God.

By <HI>the Earth which beareth Thorns and Briars,</HI> is pointed out the Soul that &s;o repeatedly continues to re&s;i&s;t, and back|&s;lide from the Divine Vi&s;itor, as to bring forth, and abide in, wicked Works, which occa&s;ions him to reject and for&s;ake it; the Con&s;equence whereof mu&s;t be its final Condemnation and De&s;truction.</P>
<P>This Portion of Scripture thus demon&s;trates, both the Certainty of a Day of Divine Vi&s;ita|tion to the Souls of Men, and the Po&s;&s;ibility of its being di&s;continued, whil&s;t they remain in the Body.</P>

The <HI>Quakers</HI> deny no Part of Divine Revelation; therefore are in no Re&s;pects to be &s;tiled Dei&s;ts. They believe both in the In&s;piration of the Scriptures, and that of the Holy Spirit.

Such a One has no Right to reproach tho&s;e with the Name of Dei&s;ts, who believe the Penmen of Scripture

To pretend, that the in&s;pired Records mu&s;t be needle&s;s to, and therefore &s;et a&s;ide by, tho&s;e who believe the Continuance of internal In&s;piration, is fal&s;ly inferred; for, the Scriptures of the Old Te&s;ta|ment were u&s;eful to, and u&s;ed by the in&s;pired Apo&s;tles; and tho&s;e who have at Times expe|rienced the Renewals of In&s;piration, know that the Scriptures are often thereby brought to their Remembrance, more clearly opened, and rendered more u&s;eful and comfortable to them, than it is po&s;&s;ible for them to be with|out it.

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. WHAT <HI>S. N.</HI> pretends to cite, Page 144, from <HI>G. Fox</HI>'s great My&s;tery, is not there. It is nothing better than a Per|ver&s;ion of Expre&s;&s;ions of a different Meaning, made formerly by <HI>Thomas Hicks,</HI> from whom he has taken it at &s;econd Hand, and who was one of the many unju&s;t and violent Adver&s;aries of the <HI>Quakers</HI> in the la&s;t Century; confuted by <HI>George Whitehead,</HI> in the &s;econd Part of the <HI>Chri&s;tian Quaker,</HI> and by <HI>William Penn,</HI> in his <HI>Rea&s;on again&s;t Railing,</HI> and his <HI>Counterfeit Chri&s;tian detected.</HI></P>
<P>What <HI>G. Fox</HI> &s;aith in his great My&s;tery, P. 68, is, <Q>Chri&s;t is in you except ye be Reprobates," &s;aith the Apo&s;tle; and again, God breathed into Man <HI>the Breath of Life,</HI> and he became a living Soul; for <HI>that</HI> which came out from God, was the Cau&s;e that Man became alive, a living Soul, and is not <HI>this</HI> of God?&mdash;Is not <HI>that</HI> of God <HI>which came out from God?</HI></Q> This he did not intend of the Soul it&s;elf, but of <HI>the inbreathing of Divine Life</HI> in the Soul. Of <HI>this Life</HI> it is that he &s;aith, <Q>It brings the Soul that is faith|ful to it, up into God, from whence it came, whereby they come to be one Soul;</Q> mean|ing in <HI>Unity,</HI> not <HI>Identity.</HI> What he means, P. 29 and 91, by the Soul's being <HI>infinite,</HI> is only <HI>immortal,</HI> or <HI>of infinite Duration,</HI> not
<PB N="210" REF="021391_0212_0FB36B2235749DB8"><HI>Expan&s;ion.</HI> The&s;e Terms he &s;ometimes u&s;ed one for another, as is common among&s;t unlet|tered Per&s;ons. It is evident from his own Words, P. 91, that he did not mean the Soul was a Part of the Divine E&s;&s;ence; for he there &s;peaks of its being in a State of Death whil&s;t in Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, which is not po&s;&s;ible to the Divine E&s;&s;ence, and afterwards adds, <Q>Every Man that cometh into the World, having a Light from Chri&s;t Je&s;us (the Way out of the Fall, the &s;econd <HI>Adam</HI>) receiving the Light, they receive Redemption and Sanc|tification, whereby their Spirits, Bodies, and Souls are &s;anctified.</Q> Here he plainly di&s;tingui&s;hes between the Soul, and that which it receives of the Divine Nature which &s;anc|tifies it.</P>
<P><HI>G. Fox</HI>'s Treati&s;e was printed in 1659, and contains cur&s;ory An&s;wers to above an Hundred different Oppo&s;ers, who in a Manner mobbed him from the Pre&s;s at that contentious Period; and as he had full Employment for his Time otherwi&s;e, and had not the Benefit of that Literature which is now common, infamous Advantages then were, and have often &s;ince been taken by de&s;igning Antagoni&s;ts, of the Inaccuracy of his Expre&s;&s;ions. But I &s;hould think it beneath any Per&s;on of a liberal Edu|cation, and Character, to copy from tho&s;e Ill-intenders, or to follow them in &s;uch a di&s;inge|nuous Line. Neither the Wittici&s;m of <HI>S. N.</HI>'s <HI>&s;en&s;ible Writer,</HI> nor his own Reflection upon it, has any Foundation in our Doctrine.</P>

<P>Great Part of what follows, and indeed a large Portion of his Volume, is made up of Repetitions from his Letter, with additional Suppo&s;itions, which are untruly fathered upon

<P N="11">11. P. 180. Our Examiner <HI>pre&s;umes entirely to refute every Thing</HI> Barclay<HI>'s Defender has advanced upon</HI> Luke xvii. 20, 21. The Pa&s;|&s;age is, <Q>The Kingdom of God cometh not with Ob&s;ervation, neither &s;hall they &s;ay, lo here, or lo there; for behold the Kingdom of God <HI>is within you.</HI></Q> To &s;uit his Pur|po&s;e, <HI>S.

<P>To accompli&s;h my entire Refutation, he takes the Word entos, out of the original Greek, the proper Signification of which is <HI>within,</HI> as it &s;tands in our Tran&s;lation. It is al&s;o rendered in <HI>Latin intus</HI> by <HI>Beza,</HI> and <HI>intra</HI> by <HI>Ca&s;talio,</HI> both which &s;ignify <HI>within.</HI> In&s;tead of this my Opponent &s;ub&s;titutes en, which is u&s;ually rendered <HI>in</HI> or <HI>among.</HI> By the like Practice the Scripture may be made
<PB N="227" REF="021391_0229_0FB36B4FDF0EB6D0">to teach any Doctrine what&s;oever. But to common Under&s;tandings, the taking away an original Word from the Text, and putting another in its Place different in Signification, is a direct <HI>Fal&s;ification</HI> of Scripture; which is the more notorious, as there does not appear to be any various Reading in the <HI>Greek</HI> Text to afford a Pretence for it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>See the <HI>Greek</HI> Te&s;tament, printed at <HI>Oxford,</HI> 1765; to which are added various Readings, collated from above one Hundred Manu&s;cripts, and from the ancient Ver&s;ions.</P>
<P>See al&s;o <HI>Mill</HI>'s <HI>Greek</HI> Te&s;tament.</P></NOTE> The Cau&s;e of Truth &s;tands in Need of no &s;uch Artifices; nor can that Sy&s;tem be according to Truth, which is obliged to Fal&s;hood for its Support.</P>
<P>When a Writer, who profe&s;&s;es &s;o high an E&s;teem for the Holy Scriptures, takes &s;uch unwarrantable Freedoms with them, as openly to fal&s;ify them to &s;erve his Purpo&s;e; his Efforts, in&s;tead of accompli&s;hing the Refutation of others, mu&s;t terminate in Self-confu&s;ion. For this, I refer to P. 239, where he vents him|&s;elf in the&s;e opprobrious Terms, <Q>To adopt a religious Scheme which is contrary to them,</Q> (the Scriptures) <Q>though we may borrow the Phara&s;eology and Terms of Scripture to expre&s;s it, mu&s;t be <HI>impious daring In&s;olence, and attrocious Rebellion</HI> again&s;t the Divine Government.

<P>Page 184. He teaches, that the Apo&s;tolic Expre&s;&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. i. 27.</NOTE> <HI>Chri&s;t in you the Hope of Glory,</HI> only intends, <Q>that Chri&s;t &s;hould be freely pro|claimed among the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> to give them the Hope of eternal Glory.</Q> Which is very much like a&s;&s;erting, that the Proclamation concerning Chri&s;t without them, is Chri&s;t in them, or at lea&s;t, all that is meant by it. But pre&s;ently after, he acknowledges the Truth in Part, where he &s;ays,&mdash; <Q>Chri&s;t no doubt, <HI>dwelt and reigned in their Hearts, by his Spirit,</HI> through its purifying Influence.</Q> He after|wards expre&s;&s;es an Apprehen&s;ion that <HI>I cannot think</HI> Paul <HI>meant, Chri&s;t &s;o dwelt in the Hearts of all Mankind univer&s;ally.</HI> Certainly I can|not; but at the &s;ame Time I mu&s;t think, he appeared by his Spirit in the Minds of all, either as a Comforter, a Purifier, or a Con|victor and Reprover, in order that they might believe in, and obey him under this Appear|ance, through which they would find him to become the Hope of Glory in them.</P>
<P>In Matters of &s;uch high Concern as relate to our eternal State, it is incumbent upon all, to be more cautious than confident about <HI>the Exclu&s;ion of their Fellow-creatures from the Grace and Salvatian of God;</HI> le&s;t by a&s;&s;erting the Non-exi&s;tence of that Experience in others, them&s;elves have not yet known, they become of tho&s;e to whom our Saviour declares,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. xxiii. 13.</NOTE> <Q>Ye &s;hut up the Kingdom of Heaven again&s;t

<P>What follows is chiefly a Repetition of what our Opponent publi&s;hed before in his Letter, the Tenour of which is already obviated in divers Parts of this Work, and therefore I &s;hall now take my Leave of him, pa&s;&s;ing by Abundance of his Illiberalities, and &s;incerely wi&s;hing, that him&s;elf, and all Men, may come really <HI>to know</HI> the only true God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">John xvii. 3.</NOTE> whom he hath &s;ent, that they may experience Life eternal.</P>
