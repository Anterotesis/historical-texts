<P><HI>Never was any Di&s;pen&s;ation in all its Circum|&s;tances to be Compared to that, It was a wonder how their frail Natures could Endure the Maje&s;ty and Terror of the Lord, that they were not quite oppre&s;&s;ed by the over-bearing Glory.</HI></P>

<P>By Terrible things in Righteou&s;ne&s;s, wilt thou An&s;wer us, O God of our Salvation,&mdash;</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN this P&s;alm, David begins by &s;aying, that <HI>Prai&s;e waited for God in Zion</HI> and <HI>unto him the Vow &s;hall be performed.</HI> What if we &s;hould conjecture Now, that this may po&s;&s;ibly have reference to that period of time, when David finding a little re&s;pite from his Wars and having Conquered <HI>Jebus</HI> (which was afterward, called <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI>) and particularly taken the Strong-hold of <HI>Zion,</HI> which was called the
<PB N="2" REF="003861_0010_10020668D7DECB48"><HI>City of David,</HI> And having fitted up a place for the reception of it, was preparing to bring the Ark of God in thither; To be &s;ure, this is what he had <HI>Vowed,</HI> and at length happily Accompli&s;hed and he el&s;e|where Appeals to the Lord to be graciou&s;ly remembred for his Zeal in that matter, as we find in P&s;al. 132. beg. <HI>Lord, Remember David and all his afflictions, how he &s;ware unto the Lord and vowed to the mighty God of Jacob, Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my hou&s;e, nor go up into my bed, I will not give &s;leep to mine eyes, or &s;lumber to mine eye lids until I find out a place for the Lord, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob, Lo, we heard of it in Ephrata, we &s;ound it in the fields of the wood: We will go into his Tabernacles, we will wor&s;hip at his foot|&s;tool, Ari&s;e, O Lord, into thy re&s;t, thou&s;and the Ark of thy &s;trength.</HI></P>
<P>Prai&s;e <HI>waited</HI> or was <HI>Silent</HI> for God, (as the Hebrew word &s;ignifies) now in Zion, The Servants of God &s;tood ready, as &s;oon as the Ark &s;hould be brought in, and the Wor|&s;hip of God be &s;et up there, to Celebrate his prai&s;e and there he &s;hould be prai&s;ed from Generation to Generation.</P>
<P>And not only God's peculiar people the Jews but Pro&s;elites and people out of all Na|tions, brought by the Fame of the God of
<PB N="3" REF="003861_0011_100265D9C275DA30">I&s;rael, &s;hould come to Zion with their prayers and prai&s;es, as we learn from, ver. 2. <HI>O thou that heare&s;t prayer, unto thee &s;hall all fle&s;h come.</HI></P>
<P>As to their Pre&s;ent &s;tate indeed, he Ac|knowledgeth it to be bad Enough, Iniquities prevailing and abounding among them (In his Predece&s;&s;or's reign, too little care had been taken about the Exerci&s;e and E&s;tab|li&s;hment of religion, Neither had he that ju&s;t authority in his own Court as yet, which were to be wi&s;hed, while the Sons of Zer|viah were frequently too hard for him) But then he Exerci&s;eth faith, that God would graciou&s;ly pardon their Iniquities and heal their back&s;lidings. Ver. 3. <HI>Iniquiries prevail against me: as for our tran&s;gri&s;&s;ions thou &s;halt purge them away.</HI></P>
<P>And now he refre&s;heth him&s;elf with the Con&s;ideration of the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of their condition, who &s;hall he admitted to approach into the pre&s;ence of God in the way of his appointment (a thing too little under&s;tood and Valued by vulgar and carnal minds) ver. 4. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is the man whom thou chu&s;e&s;t and cau&s;e&s;t to approach unto thee that he may dwell in thy courts; we &s;hall be &s;atisfied with the goodne&s;s of thy hou&s;e and of thy holy temple.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="003861_0012_1002066CB0A71400">
Why may it not be thought that David hath particular reference to him&s;elf here? E&s;pecially when we compare the words with a Sam. 6.21. &mdash; <HI>It was before the Lord which cho&s;e me before thy Father.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Now come in the words of the Text, which &s;eem a little to cloud and Darken this glorious pro&s;pect, wherein he &s;aith, <HI>By terrible things in righteou&s;ne&s;s, wilt thou an&s;wer us.</HI></P>
<P>If the foregoing Expo&s;ition &s;hould hold and may be allowed, whither the&s;e words may not refer to the breach that was made upon <HI>&V;zzah,</HI> in the Day when the Ark was bringing up to the City of David, An ac|count whereof we have at large, in 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 6. I &s;ubmit to better Judgments. Certainly, it was an awful and terrible thing, And it was done <HI>in Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> too, however &s;evere it might &s;eem; David was much affected with it, And it put a &s;top to the bringing home of the Ark for &s;ome years afterwards.</P>
<P>Some Interpreters Expound the&s;e words of the terrible Judgments which God is wont to Inflict upon the Enemies of his Church and People; They pray to him in their di&s;tre&s;s, when they are &s;et upon and u&s;ed hardly by their Enemies and the Lord
<PB N="5" REF="003861_0013_100265DD46999728">hears in heaven his dwelling place and Exe|cutes Judgments oftentimes in a terrible manner upon the&s;e their Enemies in An&s;wer to their prayers, So he did at the red Sea, upon Pharaoh and his ho&s;t, So he did in the Days of Jeho&s;haphat, upon the Children of Moab and the Children of Ammon, And often at other times.</P>
<P>Other Interpreters, tell us, that this may be under&s;tood, <Q>Of the rebukes which God in his providence gives &s;omtimes to his own People, He often an&s;wers them by terrible things for the Awakening and Quickning of them, But always in righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, He neither doth them any wrong, nor means them any hurt; for Even then he is the God of their Salva|tion, By wonderful things, Things which are very Surprizing, Things that &s;trike an Aw upon us wilt thou an&s;wer us; The holy freedom that we are admitted unto in God's Courts, and the Nearne&s;s of our approach unto him, mu&s;t not at all abate our reverence and godly fear of him, <HI>For he is terrible in his holy places,</HI> P&s;al. 68.34, 35.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Henry</HI> in loc.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>The term <HI>An&s;wer us</HI> here u&s;ed, doth not always &s;tand for <HI>a reply</HI> to &s;omthing before

Luke 14.355. Yea, when God &s;uits his providential di&s;pen&s;ations to &s;omthing be|fore done by a per&s;on or people, he is &s;aid to An&s;wer them P&s;al. 99.8. <HI>Thou an&s;wered&s;t them, O Lord our God; thou mo&s;t a God that forgave&s;t them though thou woke&s;t vengeance of their inventions.</HI> Perhaps in the Text this term <HI>An&s;wer</HI> may be taken as Equivalent to the Terms <HI>Shew</HI> or <HI>Manife&s;t, By terrible things in righteou&s;ne&s;s, wilt thou manife&s;t thy &s;elf to us, O God of our Salvation.</HI> When God puts on glory and arrayeth him&s;elf with Maje&s;ty and comes near to his people in any of his great and mighty works, &s;triking an aw and dread into their hearts and cau&s;ing them to feel &s;omthing of the weight of his hand, then he may be &s;aid <HI>by terrible things in righteou&s;ne&s;s to an&s;wer them.</HI></P>
