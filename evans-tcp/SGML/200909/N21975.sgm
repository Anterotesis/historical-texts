<HEAD>THE MELANCHOLY END OF UNGRATEFUL CHILDREN.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>YOU &s;tubborn-hearted children hear,</L>
<L>That &s;light your aged parents dear,</L>
<L>Draw near a while, with patience wait,</L>
<L>While I this tragedy relate.</L>
<L>No further off than Burkentown,</L>
<L>There liv'd a man of high renown,</L>
<L>Who had a &s;on and daughter bright,</L>
<L>To give him&s;elf and wife delight.</L>
<L>The maid was formed beauteous fair,</L>
<L>And female pride engag'd her care,</L>
<L>Neglecting thought of God on high,</L>
<L>She follow'd wordly vanity.</L>
<L>The&s;e people did much pains afford,</L>
<L>To make their children love the Lord;</L>
<L>But where God doth not grace be&s;tow,</L>
<L>What can poor feeble mortals do.</L>
<L>At length a certain wealthy man,</L>
<L>To court the lady fair began;</L>
<L>Her parents lik'd the offer well,</L>
<L>As few in riches did excel.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="028961_0003_0FDDBD14ACF7E2F8">
When he had gain'd the maiden's love,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tate did an objection prove;</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">he had not wealth enough to wed,</L>
<L>With one &s;o rich as him, he &s;aid.</L>
<L>Her parents gave her all their &s;tore,</L>
<L>Save what their &s;on had got before,</L>
<L>That &s;he might marry hand&s;omely,</L>
<L>As her rich lover did agree.</L>
<L>They married were in &s;plendor great,</L>
<L>And &s;ettled in a lofty &s;tate;</L>
<L>The &s;on and daughter thus did &s;hare</L>
<L>That wealth, which was their father's care,</L>
<L>Excepting forty pounds a-year,</L>
<L>Which the old people thought with care</L>
<L>Would &s;erve them both to live upon,</L>
<L>Their &s;on and daughter being gone.</L>
<L>This aged couple, as we hear,</L>
<L>Did afterwards &s;pend many a year</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> pious ways, and godly deeds,</L>
<L>Which from the Chri&s;tian's heart proceeds.</L>
<L>But oftentimes the Lord on high,</L>
<L>The faith and zeal of &s;aints to try,</L>
<L>Sends trials and afflictive frowns,</L>
<L>And all their flatt'ring hope confounds.</L>
<L>Thus this old couple felt the rod,</L>
<L>Of an all-wi&s;e omni&s;cient God;</L>
<L>A dreadful fire in dead of night,</L>
<L>Burnt their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in their fight.</L>
<L>Thus &s;tripp'd of all their needed &s;tore,</L>
<L>They now became exceeding poor;</L>
<L>Naked, as ri&s;ing from their bed,</L>
<L>Without their needed clothes they fled.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="028961_0004_0FDD5F291D10CFA8">
They on their daughter then did wait,</L>
<L>Told her of their unhappy fate,</L>
<L>Saying, dear child what mu&s;t we do,</L>
<L>Unle&s;s we are &s;ecur'd by you.</L>
<L>She with a frown to them did &s;ay,</L>
<L>What would you have me do, I pray;</L>
<L>I have got children of my own,</L>
<L>I think I mu&s;t fir&s;t look at home.</L>
<L>Wringing their hands, her mother cries</L>
<L>Our nakedne&s;s I hope you'll hide:</L>
<L>My aged limbs with cold do quake,</L>
<L>Child pity us for heaven's &s;ake.</L>
<L>She &s;ays, you may &s;tay here to-night,</L>
<L>And in the morning when 'tis light,</L>
<L>Your nakedne&s;s for once I'll hide,</L>
<L>Then for your&s;elves you mu&s;t provide.</L>
<L>And in the morning &s;traight &s;he goes,</L>
<L>And looks &s;ome of the ca&s;t-off cloaths,</L>
<L>Saying, eat your breakfa&s;t, and be gone,</L>
<L>And &s;ee that you no more here come.</L>
<L>They at their table mu&s;t not eat,</L>
<L>But with the &s;ervants &s;et at meat;</L>
<L>Still they with patient Job did &s;ay,</L>
<L>The Lord that gave did take away;</L>
<L>And therefore we will patient be:</L>
<L>Next to our &s;on we'll go, and &s;ee</L>
<L>If he'll receive us in di&s;tre&s;s,</L>
<L>Oppre&s;s'd by age, and comfortle&s;s.</L>
<L>They &s;traightway waited on their &s;on,</L>
<L>Who liv'd a mile or two from town,</L>
<L>Saying, dear child &s;ome pity &s;hew,</L>
<L>To tho&s;e who oft have cheri&s;h'd you.</L>

You've heard of our unhappy fate,</L>
<L>How we have been di&s;tre&s;t of late,</L>
<L>They wrung their trembling hands and &s;aid,</L>
<L>Let us not want in age for bread.</L>
<L>The &s;on he coldly did reply,</L>
<L>I know not what to &s;ay, not I,</L>
<L>You can't expect me to maintain</L>
<L>You both cannot long here remain.</L>
<L>They for a fortnight tarried there,</L>
<L>At length the &s;on began to &s;wear,</L>
<L>Saying, you mu&s;t no longer &s;tay,</L>
<L>Therefore, I tell you, pack away.</L>
<L>The father &s;aid unto his wife,</L>
<L>O that the Lord would take our life,</L>
<L>O cruel children, mo&s;t &s;evere,</L>
<L>Tigers and bears much kinder are.</L>
<L>They hand in hand did wander &s;trait,</L>
<L>Once more unto their daughter's gate,</L>
<L>The &s;ervant &s;tanding at the door,</L>
<L>Her charity they did implore.</L>
<L>The &s;ervant did not know their face,</L>
<L>But to her mi&s;tre&s;s told the ea&s;e,</L>
<L>How a poor aged couple here,</L>
<L>Did a&s;k her for a draught of beer.</L>
<L>Go draw them &s;ome the mi&s;tre&s;s &s;aid,</L>
<L>And get them each a piece of bread,</L>
<L>But as &s;he look'd the window through,</L>
<L>She with a frown, &s;aid is it you,</L>
<L>Here, &s;top your hand then &s;he did &s;ay,</L>
<L>I &s;hall be plagued thus every day,</L>
<L>Go tell them I will give them none,</L>
<L>And from the gate bid them begone.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="028961_0006_0FDDBD1C282C2248">
The &s;ervant &s;aid there's nothing here,</L>
<L>And from the gate you mu&s;t repair,</L>
<L>They &s;aid go back you dam&s;el dear,</L>
<L>Tell them it is their parents here.</L>
<L>The &s;ervant told her what they &s;aid,</L>
<L>She in a pa&s;&s;ion &s;truck her maid,</L>
<L>Saying, go do as you were bid,</L>
<L>And keep di&s;graceful &s;tories hid.</L>
<L>The &s;ervant put them from the door,</L>
<L>They wrung their hands and wept full &s;ore,</L>
<L>Into a barn they then did hie,</L>
<L>In bitter grief, prepar'd to die.</L>
<L>But look not on the &s;tory here</L>
<L>As a tale fictious, not &s;incere,</L>
<L>For in this land it does appear,</L>
<L>There &s;ome &s;uch gracele&s;s children are.</L>
<L>The next morn the old pair were found,</L>

<L>News to the daughter &s;traitway came,</L>
<L>She laughed when &s;he heard the &s;ame.</L>
<L>Their age, and extreme poverty,</L>
<L>It was too trouble&s;ome to me,</L>
<L>No more of them I now &s;hall hear,</L>
<L>I from their trouble am &s;et clear.</L>
<L>But &s;oon the heavy hand of God,</L>
<L>Extended his avenging rod,</L>
<L>One day the &s;on a hunting rode,</L>
<L>And &s;oon his hor&s;e the rider thow'd.</L>
<L>He broke his neck and in&s;tantly</L>
<L>Extended on the ground did die,</L>
<L>His &s;i&s;ter heard it, and the fright</L>
<L>Brought a hot fever on that night.</L>

Her &s;en&s;es quickly fled away,</L>

<L>Her body &s;hould in earth be laid,</L>
