<P>UNIVERSAL empire is the prerogative of a writer. His concerns are with all mankind, and though he cannot command their obedience, he can a&s;&s;ign them their duty. The Republic of Letters is more ancient than monarchy, and of far higher character in the world than the va&s;&s;al court of Britain; he that re|bels again&s;t rea&s;on is a real rebel, but he that in defence of rea&s;on, rebels again&s;t tyranny, has a better title to "DE|FENDER OF THE FAITH" than George the Third.</P>
<P>AS a military man your Lord&s;hip may hold out the &s;word of war, and call it the "ULTIMA RATIO RE|GUM:" <HI>The la&s;t Rea&s;on of Kings;</HI> we in return can &s;how you the &s;word of ju&s;tice, and call it, <Q>The be&s;t Scourge of Tyrants.</Q> The fir&s;t of the&s;e two may threaten, or even frighten, for a while, and ca&s;t a &s;ickly languor over an in&s;ulted people, but rea&s;on will &s;oon recover the de|bauch, and re&s;tore them again to tranquil fortitude. Your Lord&s;hip, I find, has now commenced author and pub|li&s;hed a proclamation; I too have publi&s;hed a cri&s;is; as they &s;tand, they are the antipodes of each other; both can|not ri&s;e at once, and one of them mu&s;t de&s;cend: And &s;o quick is the revolution of things, that your Lord&s;hip's performance, I &s;ee, has already fallen many degrees from its fir&s;t place, and is now ju&s;t vi&s;ible on the edge of the political horizon.</P>
<P>IT is &s;urpri&s;ing to what pitch of infatuation blind folly and ob&s;tinacy will carry mankind, and your Lord&s;hip's drow&s;y proclamation is a proof that it does not even quit them in their &s;leep. Perhaps you thought America too was taking a nap, and therefore, cho&s;e, like &s;atan to Eve, to whi&s;per the delu&s;ion &s;oftly, le&s;t you &s;hould awaken her.
<PB N="11" REF="015493_0003_0F998654A01AC3E8">
This Continent, Sir, is too exten&s;ive to &s;leep all at once, and too watchful, even in its &s;lumbers, not to &s;tartle at the unhallowed foot of an invader. You may i&s;&s;ue your proclamations, and welcome, for we have learned to <HI>"re|verence our&s;elves"</HI> and &s;corn the in&s;ulting ruffian that em|ploys you. America for your decea&s;ed brother's &s;ake would gladly have &s;hown you re&s;pect, and it is a new aggravation to her feelings that <HI>Howe</HI> &s;hould be forgetful, and rai&s;e his &s;word again&s;t tho&s;e, who at their own charge rai&s;ed a mo|nument to his brother. But your ma&s;ter has commanded, and you have not enough of nature left to refu&s;e. Surely! there mu&s;t be &s;omething &s;trangely degenerating in the love of monarchy, that can &s;o completely wear a man down to an ingrate, and make him proud to lick the du&s;t that kings have trod upon. A few more years, &s;hould you &s;urvive them, will be&s;tow on you the title of an old man, and in &s;ome hour of future reflection you may probably find the fitne&s;s of Wool&s;ey's de&s;pairing penitence, <Q>Had I &s;erved my God as faithfully as I have &s;erved my king, he would not thus have for&s;aken me in my old age.</Q></P>
<P>THE character you appear to us in is truly ridiculous. Your friends, the Tories, announced your coming with high de&s;criptions of your unlimited powers; but your pro|clamation has given them the lie, by &s;hewing you to be a Commi&s;&s;ioner without authority. Had your powers been ever &s;o great, they were nothing to us, farther than we plea&s;ed; becau&s;e we had the &s;ame right which other na|tions had, to do what we thought was be&s;t. "THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA," will &s;ound as pompou&s;ly in the world or in hi&s;tory as <HI>"The Kingdom of Great-Britain;"</HI> The character of <HI>General Wa&s;hington</HI> will fill a page with as much lu&s;tre as that of <HI>Lord Howe;</HI> and the <HI>Congre&s;s</HI> have as much right to command the <HI>King and Parliament</HI> of London, to de&s;i&s;t from legi&s;lation, as <HI>they</HI> or <HI>you</HI> have to command the Congre&s;s. Only &s;uppo&s;e how laughable &s;uch an edict would appear from us, and then, in that merry mood, do but turn the tables upon your&s;elf, and you will &s;ee how your proclamation is received here. Having thus placed you in a proper po&s;ition in which you may have a full view of folly and learn to de&s;pi&s;e it, I hold up to you, for that purpo&s;e, the following quotation from your own lunarian proclamation "And We (Lord Howe and General Howe) "do command, (and in his Ma|je&s;ty's

name for&s;ooth) <Q>all &s;uch per&s;ons as are a&s;&s;embled to|gether under the name of general or provincial Con|gre&s;&s;es, Committees, Conventions, or other A&s;&s;ocia|tions, by whatever name or names known or di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, to de&s;i&s;t and cea&s;e from all &s;uch trea&s;onable actings and doings.</Q></P>
<P>YOU introduce your proclamation by referring to your declarations of the 14th of July and 19th of September. In the la&s;t of the&s;e, you &s;unk your&s;elf below the character of a private gentleman. That I may not &s;eem to accu&s;e you unju&s;tly I &s;hall &s;tate the circum&s;tance: By a verbal invita|tion of yours communicated to Congre&s;s by General Sul|livan, then a pri&s;oner on his parole, you &s;ignified your de&s;ire of conferring with &s;ome members of that body as private gentlemen. It was beneath the dignity of the Ame|rican Congre&s;s to pay any regard to a me&s;&s;age that at be&s;t was but a genteel affront, and had too much of the mini&s;terial complexion of tampering with private per|&s;ons; and which might probably have been the ca&s;e, had the gentlemen who were deputed on that bu&s;ine&s;s, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that ea&s;y kind of virtue which an Engli&s;h courtier is &s;o truly di&s;tingui&s;hed by. Your reque&s;t however was com|plied with, for hone&s;t men are naturally more tender of their civil than their political fame. The interview ended as every &s;en&s;ible man thought it would; for your Lord&s;hip knows, as well as the writer of the Cri&s;is, that it is im|po&s;&s;ible for the king of England to promi&s;e the repeal, or even the revi&s;al, of any acts of parliament; wherefore, on your part, you had nothing to &s;ay, more than to reque&s;t, in the room of demanding, the entire &s;urrender of the Conti|nent; and then, if that was complied with, to promi&s;e that the inhabitants &s;hould e&s;cape with their lives. This was the up&s;hot of the conference. You informed the conferees that you were two months in &s;oliciting the&s;e powers. We a&s;k, what powers? for as Commi&s;&s;ioner you have none. If you mean the power of pardoning, it is an oblique proof that your ma&s;ter was determined to &s;acrifice all before him; and that you were two months in di&s;&s;uading him from his purpo&s;e. Another evidence of his &s;avage ob&s;tinacy! From your own account of the matter we may ju&s;tly draw the&s;e two conclu&s;ions; fir&s;t, that you &s;erve a mon&s;ter; and &s;e|condly, that never was a commi&s;&s;ioner &s;ent on a more fooli&s;h errand than your&s;elf. This plain language may per|haps

&s;ound uncoothly to an ear viciated by courtly refine|ments; but words were made for u&s;e, and the fault lies in de&s;erving them, or the abu&s;e in applying them unfairly.</P>
<P>SOON after your return to New-York you publi&s;hed a very illiberal and unmanly hand bill again&s;t the Congre&s;s; for it was certainly &s;tepping out of the line of common ci|vility, fir&s;t to &s;creen your national pride by &s;oliciting an interview with them as private gentlemen, and in the con|clu&s;ion to endeavour to deceive the multitude by making an hand bill attack on the whole body of the Congre&s;s; you got them together under one name, and abu&s;ed them under another. But the king you &s;erve and the cau&s;e you &s;up|port afford you &s;o few in&s;tances of acting the gentleman, that out of pity to your &s;ituation the Congre&s;s pardoned the in&s;ult by taking no notice of it.</P>
<P>YOU &s;ay in that hand bill, <Q>that they, the Congre&s;s, di&s;avowed every purpo&s;e for reconciliation not con&s;onant with their extravagant and inadmi&s;&s;ible claim of Inde|pendence.</Q> Why, God ble&s;s me! what have you to do with our Independence? we a&s;k no leave of yours to &s;et it up; we a&s;k no money of yours to &s;upport it; we can do better without your fleets and armies than with them; you may &s;oon have enough to do to protect your&s;elves without being burthened with us. We are very willing to be at peace with you, to buy of you and &s;ell to you, and, like young beginners in the world, to work for our own living; therefore, why do you put your&s;elves out of ca&s;h, when we know you cannot &s;pare it, and we do not de&s;ire you to run into debt? I am willing, Sir, you &s;hould &s;ee your fol|ly in every view I can place it, and for that rea&s;on de&s;cend &s;ometimes to tell you in je&s;t what I wi&s;h you to &s;ee in ear|ne&s;t. But to be more &s;erious with you, why do you &s;ay "their" Independence? To &s;et you right, Sir, we tell you, that the Independency is <HI>ours</HI> not <HI>theirs.</HI> The Con|gre&s;s were authori&s;ed by every State on the Continent to publi&s;h it to all the world, and in &s;o doing are not to be con&s;idered as the inventors, but only as the heralds that proclaimed it, or the office from which the &s;en&s;e of the peo|ple received a legal form; and it was as much as any or all their heads were worth, to have treated with you on the &s;ubject of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion under any name whatever. But we know the men in whom we have tru&s;ted; can England &s;ay the &s;ame of her parliament?</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="015493_0006_0F99865882FCA218">I come now more particularly to your proclamation of the 30th of November la&s;t. Had you gained an entire con|que&s;t over all the armies of America, and then put forth a proclamation, offering (what you call) mercy, your conduct would have had &s;ome &s;pecious &s;how of humanity; but to creep by &s;urpri&s;e into a province, and there endeavour to terrify and &s;educe the inhabitants from their ju&s;t al|legiance to the re&s;t by promi&s;es, which you neither meant nor were able to fulfil, is both cruel and unmanly: Cruel in its effects; becau&s;e, unle&s;s you can keep all the ground you have marched over, how are you, in the words of your proclamation, to &s;ecure to your pro&s;elytes "the en|joyment of their property?" What are to become either of your new adopted &s;ubjects, or your old friends the To|ries, in Burlington, Bordentown, Trenton, Mountholly, and many other places, where you proudly lorded it for a few days, and then fled with the precipitation of a pur&s;ued thief? What, I &s;ay, are to become of tho&s;e wretches? What are to become of tho&s;e who went over to you from this city and State? What more can you &s;ay to them than <HI>"Shift for your&s;elves?"</HI> Or what more can they hope for than to wander like vagabonds over the face of the earth? You may now tell them to take their leave of America and all that once was theirs. Recommend them, for con&s;olation, to your ma&s;ter's court; there perhaps they may make a &s;hift to live on the &s;craps of &s;ome dangling para&s;ite, and choo&s;e companions among thou&s;ands like them&s;elves. A traitor is the foule&s;t fiend on earth!</P>
<P>IN a political &s;en&s;e we ought to thank you for thus be|queathing e&s;tates to the Continent; we &s;hall &s;oon, at this rate, be able to carry on a war without expence, and grow rich by the ill policy of Lord Howe and the generous de|fection of the Tories. Had you &s;et your foot into this city you would have be&s;towed e&s;tates upon us which we never thought of, by bringing forth traitors we were unwilling to &s;u&s;pect. But the&s;e men, you'll &s;ay, <HI>"are his maje&s;ty's mo&s;t faithful &s;ubjects;"</HI> let that honour then be all their fortune, and let his maje&s;ty take them to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I am now thoroughly di&s;gu&s;ted with them; they live in un|grateful ca&s;e and bend their whole minds to mi&s;chief. It &s;eems as if GOD had given them over to a &s;pirit of infidelity, and that they are open to conviction in no other line but that of puni&s;hment. It is time to have done with tarring, feathering,
<PB N="15" REF="015493_0007_0F99865934881308">
carting, and taking &s;ecurities for their future good behaviour; every &s;en&s;ible man mu&s;t feel a con&s;cious &s;hame at &s;eeing a poor fellow hawked for a &s;how about the &s;treets, when it is known that he is only the tool of &s;ome principal villain, bia&s;ed into his offence by the force of fal&s;e rea&s;oning, or bribed thereto through &s;ad nece&s;&s;ity. We di&s;honour our|&s;elves by attacking &s;uch trifling characters, while greater ones are &s;uffered to e&s;cape; 'tis our duty to find <HI>them</HI> out, and their proper puni&s;hment would be to exile them from the Continent for ever. The circle of them is not &s;o great as &s;ome imagine; the influence of a few have tainted many who are not naturally corrupt. A continual circulation of lies among tho&s;e who are not much in the way of hearing them contradicted, will in time pa&s;s for truth; and the crime lies not in the believer but the inventor. I am not for declaring war again&s;t every man that appears not &s;o warm as my&s;elf: Difference of con&s;titution, temper, habit of &s;peaking and many other things will go a great way in fixing the outward character of a man, yet &s;imple hone&s;ty may remain at bottom. Some men have naturally a military turn, and can brave hard&s;hips and the ri&s;k of life with a chearful face; others have not, no &s;lavery appears to them &s;o great as the fatigue of arms, and no terror &s;o powerful as that of per&s;onal danger: What can we &s;ay? We cannot alter nature, neither ought we to puni&s;h the &s;on becau&s;e the father begot him in a cowardly mood. However, I believe mo&s;t men have more courage than they know of, and that a little at fir&s;t is enough to begin with. I knew the time when I thought that the whi&s;tling of a cannon ball would have frightened me almo&s;t to death; but I have &s;ince tried it, and find I can &s;tand it with as little di&s;compo&s;ure, and (I believe) with a much ea&s;ier con&s;cience than your Lord|&s;hip. The &s;ame dread would return to me again were I in your &s;ituation, for my &s;olemn belief of your cau&s;e is, that it is helli&s;h and damnable, and under that conviction every thinking man's heart <HI>mu&s;t</HI> fail him.</P>
<P>FROM a concern that a good cau&s;e &s;hould be di&s;honoured by the lea&s;t di&s;union among us, I &s;aid in my former paper, No. 1. <Q>That &s;hould the enemy now be expelled, I wi&s;h, with all the &s;incerity of a Chri&s;tian, that the names of Whig and Tory might never more be mentioned;</Q> but there is a knot of men among us of &s;uch a venomous ca&s;t that they will not admit even one's good wi&s;hes to act in

their favour. In&s;tead of rejoicing that Heaven had, as it were, providentially pre&s;erved this city from plunder and de&s;truction, by delivering &s;o great a part of the enemy into our hands with &s;o little effu&s;ion of blood, they &s;tubbornly affected to di&s;believe it till within an hour, nay half an hour, of the pri&s;oners arriving: And the Quakers put forth a te&s;timony, dated the 20th of December, &s;igned <HI>"John Pem|berton,"</HI> declaring their attachment to the Briti&s;h govern|ment.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have ever been careful of charging offences upon whole &s;ocieties of men, but as the paper referred to is put forth by an unknown &s;et of men, who claim to them&s;elves the right of re|pre&s;enting the whole; and while the whole &s;ociety of Quakers admit its validity by a &s;ilent acknowledgment, it is impo&s;&s;ible that any di&s;tinction can be made by the public; and the more &s;o becau&s;e the New-York paper, of the 30th of December, printed by permi&s;&s;ion of our enemies, &s;ays that <Q>the Quakers begin to &s;peak openly of their attachment to the Briti&s;h con&s;titution.</Q> We are certain that we have many friends among them, and wi&s;h to know them.</NOTE> The&s;e men are continually harping on the great &s;in of <HI>our</HI> bearing arms, but the king of Britain may lay wa&s;te the world in blood and famine, and they, poor fallen &s;ouls, have nothing to &s;ay.</P>
<P>IN &s;ome future paper I intend to di&s;tingui&s;h between the different kind of per&s;ons who have been denominated <HI>Tories;</HI> for this I am clear in, that all are not &s;o who have been called &s;o, nor all men Whigs who were once thought &s;o; and as I mean not to conceal the name of any true friend when there &s;hall be occa&s;ion to mention him, neither will I that of an enemy who ought to be known, let his rank, &s;tation or religion be what it may. Much pains have been taken by &s;ome to &s;et your Lord&s;hip's private character in an amiable light, but as it has chiefly been done by men who know nothing about you, and who are no ways remarkable for their attachment to us, we have no ju&s;t authority for be|lieving it. George the Third was impo&s;ed upon us by the &s;ame arts, but TIME, at length, has done him ju&s;tice, and the &s;ame fate may probably attend your Lord&s;hip. Your avowed purpo&s;e here, is to kill, conquer, plunder, pardon and en&s;lave; and the ravages of your army through the Jer&s;ies have been marked with as much barbari&s;m as if you had openly profe&s;&s;ed your&s;elf the prince of ruffians; not even the appearance of humanity has been pre&s;erved either on the march or the retreat of your troops; no general or|der,

that I could ever learn, has ever been i&s;&s;ued to prevent or even forbid your troops from robbery wherever they came, and the only in&s;tance of ju&s;tice, if it can be called &s;uch, which has di&s;tingui&s;hed you for impartiality, is, that you treated and plundered all alike; what could not be carried away have been de&s;troyed, and mohogony furniture have been deliberately laid on the fire for fuel, rather than the men &s;hould be fatigued with cutting wood.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">As &s;ome people may doubt the truth of &s;uch wanton de|&s;truction, I think it nece&s;&s;ary to inform, that one of the people called Quakers, who lives at Trenton, gave me this information at the hou&s;e of Mr. Michael Hutchin&s;on (one of the &s;ame pro|fe&s;&s;ion) who lives near to Trenton ferry, on the Penn&s;ylvania &s;ide; Mr. Hutchin&s;on being pre&s;ent.</NOTE> There was a time when the Whigs confided much in your &s;uppo&s;ed can|dour, and the Tories re&s;ted them&s;elves on your favour; the experiments have now been made, and failed; and every town, nay every cottage, in the Jer&s;ies, where your arms have been, is a te&s;timony again&s;t you. How you may re&s;t under this &s;acrifice of character I know not, but this I know, that you &s;leep and ri&s;e with the daily cur&s;es of thou&s;ands upon you; perhaps the mi&s;ery which the Tories have &s;uf|fered by your proffered mercy may give them &s;ome claim to their country's pity, and be in the end the be&s;t favour you could &s;how them.</P>
<P>IN a folio general order book belonging to Colonel Rohl's battalion, taken at Trenton, and now in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Council of Safety for this State, the following barbarous order is frequently repeated, <Q>His Excellency the <HI>COM|MANDER IN CHIEF</HI> orders, that all inhabitants which &s;hall be found with arms, not having an officer with them, &s;hall be immediately taken and hung up.</Q> How many you may thus have privately &s;acrificed we know not, and the account can only be &s;ettled in another world. Your treatment of pri|&s;oners, in order to di&s;tre&s;s them to enli&s;t into your infernal &s;ervice, is not to be equalled by any in&s;tance in Europe. Yet this is the humane Lord Howe and his brother, whom the Tories and their three quarter kindred the Quakers, or &s;ome of them at lea&s;t, have been holding up for patterns of ju&s;tice and mercy!</P>
<P>A bad cau&s;e will ever be &s;upported by bad means and bad men, and whoever will be at the pains of examining &s;trictly into things, will find that one and the &s;ame &s;pirit

of oppre&s;&s;ion and impiety, more or le&s;s, governs through your whole party in both countries: Not many days ago I accidently fell in company with a per&s;on of this city, noted for e&s;pou&s;ing your cau&s;e, and on my remarking to him, "that it appeared clear to me, by the late providential turn of affairs, that GOD Almighty was vi&s;ibly on our &s;ide," he replied, "We care nothing for that, you may have HIM, and welcome; if we have but enough of the devil on our &s;ide we &s;hall do." However carele&s;sly this might be &s;poken matters not, 'tis &s;till the in&s;en&s;ible principle that directs all your conduct, and will at la&s;t mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly deceive and ruin you.</P>
<P>IF ever a nation was mad and fooli&s;h, blind to its own intere&s;t and bent on its own de&s;truction, it is Britain. There are &s;uch things as national &s;ins, and though the puni&s;hment of individuals may be re&s;erved to <HI>another</HI> world, national pu|ni&s;hment can only be inflicted in <HI>this</HI> world. Britain, as a nation, is in my inmo&s;t belief the greate&s;t and mo&s;t un|grateful offender again&s;t GOD on the face of the whole earth: Ble&s;s'd with all the commerce &s;he could wi&s;h for, and furni&s;hed by a va&s;t exten&s;ion of dominion with the means of civilizing both the ea&s;tern and we&s;tern world, &s;he has made no other u&s;e of both than proudly to idolize her own "Thunder," and rip up the bowels of whole countries for what &s;he could get;&mdash;like Alexander &s;he has made war her &s;port, and inflicted mi&s;ery for prodagality &s;ake. The blood of India is not yet repaid, nor the wretchedne&s;s of Africa yet requitted. Of late &s;he has enlarged her li&s;t of national cruelties by her butcherly de&s;truction of the Ca|ribbs of St. Vincents, and in returning an an&s;wer by the &s;word to the meek prayer for <HI>"Peace, Liberty and Safety."</HI> The&s;e are &s;erious things; and whatever a fooli&s;h tyrant, a debauched court, a trafficing legi&s;lature or a blinded people may think, the national account with Heaven mu&s;t &s;ome day or other be &s;ettled: All countries have &s;ooner or later been called to their reckoning; the proude&s;t empires have &s;unk when the balance was &s;truck; and Britain, like an in|dividual penitent, mu&s;t undergo her day of &s;orrow, and the &s;ooner it happens to her the better. As I wi&s;h it over, I wi&s;h it to come, but withal wi&s;h that it may be as light as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>PERHAPS your Lord&s;hip has no ta&s;te for &s;erious things; by your connexions in England I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e not:
<PB N="19" REF="015493_0011_0F99865C3AD81A28">
Therefore I &s;hall drop this part of the &s;ubject, and take it up in a line in which you will better under&s;tand me.</P>
<P>BY what means, may I a&s;k, do you expect to conquer America? If you could not effect it in the &s;ummer when our army was le&s;s than yours, nor in the winter when we had none, how are you to do it? In point of general&s;hip you have been outwitted, and in point of fortitude outdone; your advantages turn out to your lo&s;s, and &s;how us that it is in our power to ruin you by gifts: Like a game of drafts we can move out of <HI>one</HI> &s;quare to let you come in, in order that we may afterwards take two or three for one; and as we can always keep a double corner for our&s;elves, we can always prevent a total defeat. You cannot be &s;o in&s;en&s;ible as not to &s;ee that we have two to one the advantage of you, becau&s;e we conquer by a drawn game, and you lo&s;e by it. Burgoyne might have taught your Lord&s;hip this knowledge; he has been long a &s;tudent in the doctrine of chances.</P>
<P>I have no other idea of conquering countries than by &s;ubduing the armies which defend them: Have you done this, or can you do this? If you have not, it would be civil in you to let your proclamations alone for the pre&s;ent; other|wi&s;e, you will ruin more Tories by your grace and favour than you will Whigs by your arms.</P>
<P>WERE you to obtain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this city, you would not know what to do with it more than to plunder it. To hold it, in the manner you hold New-York, would be an additional dead weight upon your hands; and if a general conque&s;t is your object, you had better be without the city than with it. When you have defeated all our armies, the cities will fall into your hands of them&s;elves; but to creep into them in the manner you got into Princetown, Tren|ton, &amp;c. is like robbing an orchard in the night before the fruit be ripe, and running away in the morning. Your ex|periment in the Jer&s;ies is &s;ufficient to teach you that you have &s;omething more to do than barely to get into other people's hou&s;es; and your new converts, to whom you pro|mi&s;ed all manner of protection, and &s;educed into new guilt by pardoning them from their former virtues, mu&s;t begin to have a very contemptible opinion both of your power and your policy. Your authority in the Jer&s;ies is now reduced to the &s;mall circle which your army occupies, and your pro|clamation is no where el&s;e &s;een unle&s;s it be to be laughed at. The mighty &s;ubduers of the Continent are retreated in|to
<PB N="20" REF="015493_0012_0F99865CE38F9B70">
a nut&s;hell, and the proud forgivers of our &s;ins are fled from tho&s;e they came to pardon; and all this at a time when they were di&s;patching ve&s;&s;el after ve&s;&s;el to England with the great news of every day. In &s;hort, you have managed your Jer&s;ey expedition &s;o very dexterou&s;ly that the dead only are conquerors, becau&s;e none will di&s;pute the ground with them.</P>
<P>IN all the wars you have formerly been concerned in, you had only armies to contend with; in this ca&s;e you have both an army and a country to combat with. In former wars, the countries followed the fate of their capitals; Ca|nada fell with Quebec, and Minorca with Port Mahon or St. Philips; by &s;ubduing tho&s;e, the conquerors opened a way into, and became ma&s;ters of the country: here it is otherwi&s;e; if you get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a city here, you are obliged to &s;hut your&s;elves up in it, and can make no other u&s;e of it, than to &s;pend your country's money in. This is all the advantage you have drawn from New-York; and you would draw le&s;s from Philadelphia, becau&s;e it requires more force to keep it, and is much farther from the &s;ea. A pret|ty figure you and the Tories would cut in this city, with a river full of ice, and a town full of fire; for the immediate con&s;equence of your getting here would be, that you would be cannonaded out again and the Tories be obliged to make good the damage; and this, &s;ooner or later, will be the fate of New-York.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h to &s;ee the city &s;aved, not &s;o much from military as from natural motives. 'Tis the hiding-place of women and children, and Lord Howe's proper bu&s;ine&s;s is with our armies. When I put all the circum&s;tances together which ought to be taken, I laugh at your notion of conquering America. Becau&s;e you lived in a little country where an army might run over the whole in a few days, and where a &s;ingle company of &s;oldiers might put a multitude to the route, you expected to find it the &s;ame here. It is plain that you brought over with you all the narrow notions you were bred up with, and imagined that a proclamation in the king's name was to do great things; but Engli&s;hmen always travel for knowledge, and your Lord&s;hip, I hope, will re|turn, if you return at all, much wi&s;er than you came.</P>
<P>WE may be &s;urpri&s;ed by events we did not expect, and in that interval of recollection you may gain &s;ome tempora|ry advantage: Such was the ca&s;e a few weeks ago, but we &s;oon ripen again into rea&s;on, collect our &s;trength, and while
<PB N="21" REF="015493_0013_0F99865DA949EE58">
you are preparing for a triumph we came upon you with a defeat. Such it has been, and &s;uch it would be were you to try it an hundred times over. Were you to garri&s;on the places you might march over, in order to &s;ecure their &s;ub|jection, (for remember you can do it by no other means) your army would be like a &s;tream of water running to nothing. By the time you reached from New-York to Virginia you would be reduced to a &s;tring of drops not capable of hang|ing together; while we, by retreating from State to State, like a river turning back upon it&s;elf, would acquire &s;trength in the &s;ame proportion as you lo&s;t it, and in the end be ca|pable of overwhelming you. The country in the mean time would &s;uffer, but 'tis a day of &s;uffering, and we ought to expect it. What we contend for is worthy the affliction we may go through. If we get but bread to eat, and any kind of rayment to put on, we ought, not only to be contented, but thankful. More than <HI>that</HI> we ought not to look for, and le&s;s than <HI>that</HI> Heaven has not yet &s;uffered us to want. He that would &s;ell his Birthright for a little <HI>&s;alt,</HI> is as worthle&s;s as he who &s;old it for <HI>porridge</HI> without &s;alt. And he that would part with it for a gay coat, or a <HI>plain</HI> coat, ought for ever to be a &s;lave in buff. What are &s;alt, &s;u|gar and finery to the ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ings of "Liberty and Safety?" Or what are the inconveniencies of a few months to the tributary bondage of ages? The meane&s;t pea&s;ant in America, ble&s;s'd with the&s;e &s;entiments, is a happy man com|pared with a New-York Tory; he can eat his mor&s;el with|out repining, and when he has done, can &s;weeten it with a re|pa&s;t of whole&s;ome air; he can take his child by the hand and ble&s;s it, without feeling the con&s;cious &s;hame of neglecting a parent's duty.</P>
<P>IN publi&s;hing the&s;e remarks I have &s;everal objects in view: On your part they are, to expo&s;e the folly of your pretended authority as a Commi&s;&s;ioner; the wickedne&s;s of your cau&s;e in general; and the impo&s;&s;ibility of your conquer|ing us at any rate. On the part of the public my meaning is, to &s;how them their true and &s;olid intere&s;t; to encourage them to their own good, to remove the fears and fal&s;ities which bad men had &s;pread and weak men had encouraged; and to ex|cite in all men a love for union, and a chearfulne&s;s for duty.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;ubmit one more ca&s;e to you re&s;pecting your con|que&s;t of this country, and then proceed to new ob&s;ervations:</P>
<P>SUPPOSE our armies in every part of the Continent were

immediately to di&s;per&s;e, every man to his home, or where el&s;e he might be &s;afe, and engage to re-a&s;&s;emble again on a certain future day; it is clear that you would then have no army to contend with, yet you would be as much at a lo&s;s in that ca&s;e as you are now; you would be afraid to &s;end your troops in parties over the Continent, either to di&s;arm, or prevent us from a&s;&s;embling, le&s;t they &s;hould not return; and while you kept them together, having no army of ours to di&s;pute with, you could not call it a conque&s;t; you might furni&s;h out a pompous page in the London Gazette or the New-York paper, but when we returned at the appointed time, you would have the &s;ame work to do you had at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>IT has been the folly of Britain to &s;uppo&s;e her&s;elf more powerful than &s;he really is, and by that means have arro|gated to her&s;elf a rank in the world &s;he is not entitled to; for more than this century pa&s;t &s;he has not been able to carry on a war without foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance. In Marlborough's campaigns, and from that day to this, the number of Ger|man troops and officers a&s;&s;i&s;ting her have been about equal with her own; ten thou&s;and He&s;&s;ians were &s;ent to England la&s;t war to protect her from a French inva&s;ion; and &s;he would have cut but a poor figure in her Canadian and We&s;t-Indian expeditions, had not America been lavi&s;h both of her money and men to help her along. The only in&s;tance in which &s;he was engaged &s;ingly, that I can recollect, was again&s;t the rebellion in Scotland in forty-five and forty-&s;ix, and in that, out of three battles, &s;he was twice beaten, till by thus reducing their numbers (as we &s;hall yours) and taking a &s;upply &s;hip that was coming to Scotland with cloaths, arms and money (as we have often done) &s;he was at la&s;t enabled to defeat them. England was never famous by land; her officers have generally been &s;u&s;pected of cowardice, have more of the air of a dancing-ma&s;ter than a &s;oldier, and by the &s;ample we have taken pri&s;oners we be|gin to give the preference to our&s;elves. Her &s;trength of late has laid in her extravagance; but as her finances and her credit are now low, her &s;inews in that line begin to fail fa&s;t. As a nation &s;he is the poore&s;t in Europe; for were the whole kingdom, and all that is in it, to be put up to &s;ale like the e&s;tate of a bankrupt, it would not fetch as much as &s;he owes: Yet this thoughtle&s;s wretch mu&s;t go to war, and with the avowed de&s;ign too of making us bea&s;ts of burthen, to &s;upport her in riot and debauchery, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t her
<PB N="23" REF="015493_0015_0F99865F20B039A0">
afterwards in di&s;tre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e nations who are now our be&s;t friends. This ingratitude may &s;uit a Tory, or the unchri&s;tian peevi&s;hne&s;s of a fallen Quaker, but none el&s;e.</P>
<P>'TIS the unhappy temper of the Engli&s;h to be plea&s;ed with any war, right or wrong, be it but &s;ucce&s;sful; but they &s;oon grow di&s;contented with ill fortune, and it is an even chance that they are as clamorous for peace next &s;ummer, as the king and his mi|ni&s;ters were for war la&s;t winter. In this natural view of things, your Lord&s;hip &s;tands in a very ugly critical &s;ituation: Your whole character is &s;taked upon your laurels; if they wither, you wither with them; if they flouri&s;h, you cannot live long to look at them; and at any rate, the black account hereafter is not far off. What lately appeared to us misfortunes, were only ble&s;&s;ings in di&s;gui&s;e; and the &s;eeming advantages on your &s;ide have turned out to our profit. Even our lo&s;s of this city, as far as we can &s;ee, might be a principal gain to us: The more &s;urface you &s;pread over, the thinner you will be, and the ea&s;ier wiped away; and our con&s;olation under that apparent di&s;a&s;ter would be, that the e&s;tates of the Tories would become &s;ecurities for the repairs. In &s;hort, there is no old ground we can fail upon, but &s;ome new foundation ri&s;es again to &s;upport us. <Q>We have put, <HI>Sir,</HI> our hands to the plough, and cur&s;ed be he that looketh back.</Q></P>
<P>YOUR king, in his &s;peech to parliament la&s;t &s;pring, declared to them, <Q>That he had no doubt but the great force they had en|abled him to &s;end to America, would effectually reduce the rebelli|ous Colonies.</Q> It has not, neither can it; but it has done ju&s;t enough to lay the foundation of its own next year's ruin. You are &s;en&s;ible that you left England in a divided di&s;tracted &s;tate of politics, and, by the command you had here, you became a prin|cipal prop in the court party; their fortunes re&s;t on yours; by a &s;ingle expre&s;s you can fix their value with the public, and the degree to which their &s;pirits &s;hall ri&s;e or fall; they are in your hands as &s;tock, and you have the &s;ecret of the ally with you. Thus &s;ituated and connected, you become the unintentional me|chanical in&s;trument of your own and their overthrow. The king and his mini&s;ters put conque&s;t out of doubt, and the credit of both depended on the proof. To &s;upport them in the interim, it was nece&s;&s;ary you &s;hould make the mo&s;t of every thing; and we can tell by Hugh Gaine's New-York paper what the complexion of the London Gazette is. With &s;uch a li&s;t of victories the na|tion cannot expect you will a&s;k new &s;upplies; and to confe&s;s your want of them, would give the lie to your triumphs, and im|peach the king and his mini&s;ters of trea&s;onable deception. If you make the nece&s;&s;ary demand at home, your party &s;inks; if you make it not, you &s;ink your&s;elf; to a&s;k it now is too late, and to a&s;k it before was too &s;oon, and unle&s;s it arrive quickly will be of no u&s;e. In &s;hort, the part you have to act, cannot be acted; and I am fully per&s;uaded that all you have to tru&s;t to, is to do
<PB N="24" REF="015493_0016_0F99865FE4A64F18" MS="y">
the be&s;t you can with what force you have got, or little more. Though we have greatly excelled you in point of general&s;hip and bravery of men, yet, as a people, we have not entered into the full &s;oul of enterprize; for I, who know England and the di&s;po|&s;ition of the people well; am confident that it is ea&s;ier for us to effect a revolution there, than you a conque&s;t here: A few thou|&s;and men landed in England with the declared de&s;ign of de|po&s;ing the pre&s;ent king, bringing his mini&s;ters to trial, and &s;et|ting up the duke of Glouce&s;ter in his &s;tead, would a&s;&s;uredly carry their point, while you were groveling here ignorant of the mat|ter. As I &s;end all my papers to England, this, like COMMON SENSE, will find its way there; and though it may put one party on their guard, it will inform the other and the nation in gene|ral of our de&s;ign to help them.</P>
<P>THUS far, Sir, I have endeavoured to give you a picture of pre&s;ent affairs: You may draw from it what conclu&s;ions you plea&s;e. I wi&s;h as well to the true pro&s;perity of England as you can, but I con&s;ider <HI>Independence as America's natural Right and Intere&s;t,</HI> and never could &s;ee any real di&s;&s;ervice it would be to Britain. If an Engli&s;h merchant receives an order and is paid for it, it &s;ignifies nothing to him who governs the country&mdash;This is my creed of politics. If I have any where expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf overwarmly, 'tis from a fixt immovable hatred I have, and ever had, to cruel men and cruel mea&s;ures. I have likewi&s;e an aver|&s;ion to monarchy, as being too deba&s;ing to the dignity of man; but I never troubled others with my notions till very lately, nor ever publi&s;hed a &s;yllable in England in my life. What I write is pure nature, and my pen and my &s;oul have ever gone together. My writings I have always given away, re&s;erving only the ex|pence of printing and paper, and &s;ometimes not even that. I never courted either fame or intere&s;t, and my manner of life, to tho&s;e who know it, will ju&s;tify what I &s;ay. My &s;tudy is to be u&s;eful, and if your Lord&s;hip love mankind as well I do, you would, &s;eeing you cannot conquer us, ca&s;t about and lend your hand towards accompli&s;hing a peace. Our Independence, with GOD's ble&s;&s;ing, we will maintain again&s;t all the world; but as we wi&s;h to avoid evil our&s;elves, we wi&s;h not to inflict it on others. I am never over-inqui&s;itive into the &s;ecrets of the Cabinet, but I have &s;ome notion, that if you neglect the pre&s;ent opportunity, that it will not be in our power to make a &s;eperate peace with you afterwards; for whatever treaties or alliances we form, we &s;hall mo&s;t faithfully abide by; wherefore you may be deceived if you think you can make it with us at any time. A la&s;ting inde|pendent peace is my wi&s;h, end and aim; and to accompli&s;h that <HI>"I pray God the"</HI> Americans <Q>may never be defeated, and I tru&s;t while they have good officers, and are well commanded,</Q> and willing to be commanded, "<HI>that they</HI> NEVER WILL."</P>
