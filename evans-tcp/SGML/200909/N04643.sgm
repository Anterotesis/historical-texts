<P>And <HI>John</HI> bare Record, &s;aying, I &s;aw the Spirit de&s;cending from Heaven, <HI>like a Dove,</HI> and it abode upon him.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE Go&s;pel is CHRIST'S Go&s;pel, and &s;hould be preached with CHRIST'S Spirit. It was &s;o by his fir&s;t Mini&s;ters of it. The &s;ame Spirit which de&s;cend|ed on him came al&s;o upon the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> when they were all with one Accord in one Place, on the Day of <HI>Penteco&s;t.</HI> The like gracious Vouch&s;afement (tho' not in the extraordinary Manner and Effects thereof) is to be de&s;ired by us, the Lord's Mini&s;ters, who are met together in this Place, on the Day of our an|nual, brotherly <HI>Convention.</HI> And to prepare our Mind for it, a Di&s;cour&s;e on this Text may be &s;ea&s;onable and u&s;eful.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="005779_0005_10270CE5A24E64F8">This Record, which <HI>John the Bapti&s;t,</HI> Chri&s;t's Fore-runner, bare concerning him, refers to his &s;olemn Inauguration into his mediatorial Office, at his Bapti&s;m. <HI>Heaven was</HI> then <HI>open|ed, and the Holy Gho&s;t de&s;cended from</HI> thence, and lighted upon him. The vi&s;ible Appearance, in which the Spirit came, abode &s;ome Time upon him; the Spirit it&s;elf remain'd with him, was con&s;tantly re&s;ident in him. This was not indeed the fir&s;t of the Spirit's Coming upon our Saviour; but it was the fir&s;t which <HI>John</HI> &s;aw, and to which he gave Te&s;timony. The Spirit of God formed Chri&s;t's humane Nature, with all it's congenite Principles of Grace and Holine&s;s, free from the lea&s;t Stain or moral Imperfection. And from his Birth the Spirit was with him, making him gradually, as Man, to in|crea&s;e in Wi&s;dom, as he did in Stature. But when he was entring upon his public Mini&s;try, the Spirit came upon him in a greater Abundance of Gifts, and Graces, and Influences, thoroughly furni&s;hing of him to his Work. Then was he eminently anointed with the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t and with Power,</HI> ena|bling him to the Di&s;charge of his Office. And particularly as a <HI>Prophet;</HI> which he began with a Sermon on that Pa&s;&s;age in I&s;ai. 61.1. <HI>The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, becau&s;e the Lord hath anointed me to preach good Tidings,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>This Day,</HI> &s;aid he, (when he and read the Text) <HI>is this Scripture fulfilled in your Ears</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Luke 4.18.</NOTE>. In him dwelt the Fulne&s;s of the Godhead bodily; and he was not, con&s;ider'd in his divine Nature, of him&s;elf in&s;ufficient for his Undertaking; there was no Defect of Power in him as a divine Per&s;on, the mighty God, to be &s;upply'd by the Spirit's de&s;cending, and abiding upon him. The humane Nature of Chri&s;t was &s;trengthened with a di|vine Power to his Work; and all the A&s;&s;i&s;tance it had, was by Virtue of it's Union with, and derived from, his divine Na|ture. But &s;till the Holy Spirit is that Per&s;on in the Godhead, by which the Energy of the divine Nature, in its Operations on, and by, Chri&s;t's humane Nature was mo&s;t immediately exerted. In the Power of the Spirit did he preach, and con|firm his Doctrine, and fini&s;h the Work, which his Father gave him to do on the Earth.</P>
<P><HI>John</HI> &s;aw the Spirit de&s;cending from Heaven, <HI>like a D<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI></P>
<P>So &s;ay the <HI>Evangeli&s;ts,</HI> in the Account which they give of it. <HI>Luke</HI> tells us, <HI>the Holy Gho&s;t de&s;cended in a bodily Shape, like a Dove, upon him.</HI> Whether the Expre&s;&s;ion imports,
<PB N="7" REF="005779_0006_10270CE8FB6C43D8">
that the corporeal Form which the Spirit a&s;&s;um'd and appear'd in, was the very Shape of a <HI>Dove,</HI> or only that the Manner of the Spirit's de&s;cending, was like a <HI>Dove</HI>'s coming down, with its Wings &s;pread abroad, and &s;o hovering over and light|ing upon a Thing; may not be ea&s;y for us to determine, and it is not nece&s;&s;ary for us to know. Yet, in which of the&s;e Sen&s;es &s;oever we under&s;tand it, it &s;heweth that there was &s;omething in the Spirit's vi&s;ible De&s;cent upon Chri&s;t, re&s;em|bling a <HI>Dove,</HI> which made the Eye-Witne&s;s and in&s;pired Writers make &s;o particular mention of a Dove in their Re|cords of it. And 'tis not unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e a My&s;tery in the Spirit's de&s;cending in a <HI>Dove-like Shape,</HI> or in a <HI>Dove-like Manner:</HI> E&s;pecially &s;ince a <HI>Dove</HI> was reckon'd an Em|blem of the Holy Gho&s;t by the ancient Jews. That it was &s;o ordered by God, that there &s;hould (as the Bapti&s;t and E|vangeli&s;ts te&s;tify) be &s;ome Re&s;emblance of a Dove in the Spi|rit's de&s;cending and re&s;ting on Chri&s;t, to &s;ignify <HI>what Spirit he was of,</HI> and &s;hould exerci&s;e, in the Di&s;charge of his Office, to which he was in that Manner de&s;igned and prepared; <HI>viz.</HI> a Dove-like Spirit. Such was the Spirit that de&s;cended and abode upon him, and &s;uch was his humane Spirit, having the Characters of the divine Spirit impre&s;s'd upon it, when he was <HI>&s;ealed with the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> at his Bapti&s;m; and &s;o was &s;olemnly inve&s;ted into his Office, and perfectly accompli&s;hed for the Performance of it.</P>
<P>The Ob&s;ervation, proper to be the Subject of the pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e, from the Text, is this, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That a Dove-like Spirit is a requi&s;ite and eminent Qualifica|tion of a Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>It being the Spirit of the Lord, by whom the great Salva|tion at the fir&s;t began to be &s;poken; it &s;hould, in a good Mea&s;ure, be found in every One, that after him, and in his Name, preacheth the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. As will further ap|pear by con&s;idering the Properties of a Dove-like Spirit.</P>
<P N="1">1. A Dove-like, is a <HI>pure</HI> Spirit. The Dove was of the Number of clean Birds, in the ceremonial Di&s;tinction of 'em, and the only one that was u&s;ed in Sacrifice to God. <HI>My Dove, my Undefiled,</HI> &s;ays the &s;piritual Bridegoom to his Spou&s;e, <HI>Cant.</HI> 5.2. A Dove is therefore a fit and &s;criptural Emblem of Purity, which was perfect in the holy and undefiled Je&s;us,
<PB N="8" REF="005779_0007_10270CEBB2810420">
upon whom the Spirit de&s;cended like a Dove, qualifying him for, and actuating him in, his holy Mini&s;tration. A Dove like pure Spirit, is called in Scripture, <HI>a pure Mind, a pure Heart, a pure Con&s;cience.</HI> If any Di&s;tinction be conceived be|tween the&s;e, yet each of 'em comprehends the other, and a pure Spirit all. It is (as renewed in fallen Man) a Spirit clean&s;ed from the Defilements of Sin, con&s;ecrated, and made holy to God, thro' Sanctification of his Spirit, and in which there is no Guile prevailing: A good and hone&s;t Heart, en|dowed with Simplicity and godly Sincerity. Such ought the Spirit of a Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter, conformable to his divine Ma&s;ter's, to be.</P>
<P>His <HI>Relation</HI> to God &s;uppo&s;es and requires it: Being a&s;&s;um'd into a near and con&s;tant Attendance upon him, who is of purer Eyes than to behold Evil. This is that the Lord &s;pake with Re&s;pect to the Prie&s;t's e&s;pecially, his Mini&s;ters under the Law, (and the Rea&s;on of it is the &s;ame, and &s;tronger, in Re|gard to tho&s;e under the Go&s;pel) <HI>I will be &s;anctified in them that come nigh me</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Levit. 10.3.</NOTE>; will be approached and &s;erved as a holy God. There is no Man, no Mini&s;ter, that hath a ju&s;t and lively Apprehen&s;ion of the infinite Purity of that God, with whom he hath to do, and before whom the <HI>Seraphim</HI> cover their Faces, and their Feet, crying one to another, <HI>Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Ho&s;ts,</HI> but will be ready to &s;ay as the <HI>Prophet</HI> did, upon the vi&s;ional Repre&s;entation thereof to him, <HI>Wo is me, for I am undone, becau&s;e I am a Man of unclean Lips</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. 6.</NOTE>, and 'till his Iniquity is taken away and Sin purged, as <HI>I&s;aiah</HI>'s was, wou'd dare to an&s;wer, as he did, when one was called for to go on a divine Emba&s;&s;y, <HI>Here am I, &s;end me.</HI> An&s;werable to the relative Holine&s;s of a Mini&s;ter, in his &s;pecial Dedication to the Lord, there ought to be real Holine&s;s of Heart and Life, in a &s;incere and intire Devotedne&s;s unto him.</P>
<P>As he repre&s;ents God by Office, he &s;hould be like him in Di&s;po&s;ition: And being peculiarly God's Servant, be di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd by his Sanctity. Otherwi&s;e he di&s;parageth the Ho|line&s;s of that Maje&s;ty, in who&s;e Pre&s;ence he &s;tands, and in whole Name he mini&s;ters. If he &s;erve God with any Con|de&s;cence, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">o divine Acceptation, he mu&s;t do it with a pure Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>A pure Spirit &s;uits with the <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>End</HI> of his Office. It is a Go&s;pel pure in its Doctrines and Ordinances, that is
<PB N="9" REF="005779_0008_10270CEFF2C2EB38">
committed to his Tru&s;t and Admini&s;tration. It is pure and undefiled Religion, which he is ordain'd to propagate and ad|vance. His Spirit therefore mu&s;t be pure, that it may agree with his Work. <HI>Be ye clean, that bear the Ve&s;&s;els of the Lord</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. 52.11.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But &s;uch a Spirit, not only <HI>corre&s;ponds</HI> with the Sacredne&s;s of this Work, but <HI>qualifies</HI> for the Performance of it. The Work indeed may po&s;&s;ibly be done by a Man who&s;e Heart is not right with God in it. And one of this Character may be an In&s;trument, in the Hand of God's free Spirit, of &s;ancti|fying and &s;aving others. Yet, much every Way is the Ad|vantage of a pure Spirit, toward the di&s;charging this Office well, and to good Effect. 2 Tim. 2.21. <HI>If a Man purge him&s;elf from the&s;e</HI> (gno&s;tick Pollutions, Lu&s;ts of the Fle&s;h, and of the Mind) <HI>he &s;hall be a Ve&s;&s;el unto Honour, &s;anctified and made meet for the Ma&s;ter's U&s;e, and prepared unto every good Work.</HI> He mu&s;t be &s;anctified, that he may be duly fitted for this Service of Chri&s;t; and prepar'd, in Re&s;pect of Ability and Inclination, to every Part of his Duty therein.&mdash;<HI>Be apt to teach:</HI> Furni&s;h'd with Knowledge, and <HI>&s;hewing in Doctrine Uncorruptne&s;s, Gravity, Sincerity, &s;ound Speech that cannot be condemned.</HI> A pure Spirit &s;earches impartially after Truth, and is be&s;t capable of di&s;covering it: Being free from tho&s;e cor|rupt Affections, &amp; vicious Habits, ill Prejudices &amp; ba&s;e De&s;igns, which cloud and darken the Under&s;tanding, bribe and pervert the Judgment. What Clearne&s;s is to the Eye of the Body, That Purity is to the Eye of the Mind. A pure Heart receives the Love of the Truth: And the My&s;tery of Faith is held in a pure Con&s;cience. Purity does not intitle any Man to Infalli|bility, yet it does to the Promi&s;e of &s;ure Guidance into all nece&s;|&s;ary Truth. John 7.17. <HI>If any Man will do his Will, he &s;hall know of the Doctrine.</HI> Such a Man is liable to err from the Truth, but &s;hall not fundamentally and finally. He is mo&s;t &s;ecure from all damnable Here&s;ies, and mo&s;t likely to recover out of any con&s;iderable Mi&s;takes he may fall into. Faith and a good Con&s;cience are fa&s;te&s;t held together: They who have put away the latter, <HI>concerning Faith have made Shipwreck</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. 1.19.</NOTE>. "A good Con&s;cience, and a true Faith, like <HI>Hypocrates</HI>'s Twins, live and die together." The Teachers of fal&s;e Doc|trine, in the apo&s;tolic Age, are characteris'd as Men of <HI>corrupt Minds, Ungodly, Sen&s;uali&s;ts, filthy Dreamers, Brute-bea&s;ts.</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="005779_0009_10270CF1AB438BD8">
Such were the <HI>Gno&s;tics, Nicolaitans,</HI> and other impure Here|tics, with who&s;e mon&s;trous Opinions the chri&s;tian Church was early infe&s;ted. And in the <HI>Papal Apo&s;tacy,</HI> abominable Doc|trines have evidently their Ri&s;e from the vile Lu&s;ts of the <HI>Man of Sin.</HI> And the Mi&s;&s;ionaries of <HI>Rome,</HI> that &s;pread them, are of the Number of <HI>unclean Spirits,</HI> which <HI>John</HI> &s;aw, <HI>like Frogs, come out of the Mouth of the Dragon, and out of the Mouth of the Bea&s;t, and out of the Mouth of the fal&s;e Prophet</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. 16.13.</NOTE>.

<P>A pure Spirit is cautelous again&s;t the Abu&s;e of the <HI>Doctrines of Grace;</HI> under&s;tanding and explaining them as Doctrines according to Godline&s;s, and de&s;igned to promote univer&s;al Holine&s;s. &mdash; <HI>Election of Grace,</HI> thro' Sanctification of the Spi|rit unto Obedience: To the Means, as well as to the End.&mdash; <HI>Redemption</HI> from the Cur&s;e of the Law, as a &s;pecial Engage|ment to keep the Commandments of God.&mdash;<HI>Effectual Voca|tion</HI> to be unto Holine&s;s, and the Operations of the divine Spi|rit therein, as not excluding humane Endeavours after Grace, or &s;uperceding all u&s;e of our enfeebled Faculties in the Work of it.&mdash;<HI>Ju&s;tifying Faith</HI> as receiving whole Chri&s;t, not dividing his Offices, nor &s;ub&s;tituting his Obedience in the Place of ours. &mdash;<HI>Per&s;everance</HI> in Grace, to be accompli&s;hed in a way of conti|nual Circum&s;pection, and dutiful Diligence, working out our own Salvation with Fear and Trembling.</P>
<P>Not that when Hurt is done to the Cau&s;e of true Holine&s;s, by zealous Advocates for Grace, it is always to be imputed to the Pravity of their Minds, and doth argue them Patrons of Licentiou&s;ne&s;s; yet a pure Spirit will make a Mini&s;ter careful in e&s;tabli&s;hing peculiar Doctrines of the Go&s;pel, not to undermine, or impair practical Chri&s;tianity; never to &s;peak di&s;paragingly of Things divinely excellent; and will hardly

So far indeed as a Man is po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of the former, he is of the latter al&s;o; yet &s;omething further is required to his having the latter than the former. His Spirit may he predominated pure, and yet not inculpably harmle&s;s. Its Purity is inoffen&s;ive, yet may be accompanied with &s;omething that is noxious. There may be true Sanctity, and godly Sincerity, where there is not a competent Mea&s;ure of Prudence, to keep from offending. It is not enough, that the Spirit be free from damning Pollution, and reigning Hypocri&s;y, but al&s;o from whatever is acciden|tally, tho' it be not in its own Nature, hurtful. Con&s;cience &s;hould be void of Offence toward God, and toward Man. Purity might &s;uffice to its being &s;o toward God, if it were under no Obligation to be &s;o likewi&s;e toward Men; who are apt to be offended at more than what is in it &s;elf Evil, which, were it not for their Sakes, God would not be. A pure Spirit thinks on what&s;oever Things are true, hone&s;t, ju&s;t, pure; a harmle&s;s Spirit further, on what&s;oever Things are <HI>lovely,</HI> amiable in the Sight of Men, and <HI>of good Report</HI> among them. This Ingredient therefore of a Dove-like Spirit, fur|ther qualifies a Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter; who, in the Di&s;charge of his Office, need be more inoffen&s;ive, than Purity (alone and imperfect) renders him. He ought to &s;hun the <HI>Appearance of

Indeed, accidentally and eventually, thro' the Perver&s;ene&s;s of Men, Chri&s;t, who denounced Wo to that Man by whom Offence cometh, was a Stone of Stumbling and Rock of Offence. Yet he never gave any ju&s;t Occa&s;ion of the lea&s;t&mdash;for the Prevention thereof, we find him complying with received Cu&s;toms, and paying of Tribute, not due from him. It may be impo&s;&s;ible, but that Offences will come, upon a Mini&s;ter's Fidelity in his Office: What is required of him is, to &s;ee to it, that they do not ari&s;e thro' his Default.&mdash;That he guard his Words and Actions with &s;uch Care, guide his Affairs with &s;uch Di&s;cretion, as that he may yield no Occa&s;ion, yea, may cut off all Occa&s;ion, of Di&s;gu&s;t or Scandal&mdash;of any Man's falling into Sin, becoming di&s;affected to Religion, or di&s;cou|raged in the Practice of his Duty&mdash;<HI>Giving no Offence in any Thing, that the Mini&s;try be not blamed,</HI> and Souls hurt and de|&s;troyed.</P>
