<P>Ble&s;&s;ed are the <HI>Peacemakers,</HI> for they &s;hall be called the children of <HI>GOD.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_IT is an evidence of the degeneracy o human nature, that per&s;ons of narrow minds and divi&s;ive practices, are ap|plauded by any; but in the judgment of our Lord, the <HI>Peacemakers</HI> are ble&s;&s;ed, for they &s;hall be called the children of GOD.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e words are two parts, fir&s;t, a <HI>duty</HI> enjoin'd, <HI>peacemaking,</HI> and &s;econd, <HI>arguments</HI> to inforce it annexed. viz. the <HI>ble&s;&s;ing</HI> of CHRIST, and <HI>being called</HI> the <HI>children</HI> of GOD. The&s;e parts of the text, I purpo&s;e to explain and improve.</P>
<P N="1">I. THE <HI>peace</HI> here intended is that between man and man, as appears from the 23. and 24. ver&s;es of this chapter, where the phra&s;e is explained in the fol|lowing manner, <HI>therefore if thou bring thy gift to the al|tar, and there remebre&s;t that thy brother hath ought a|gain&s;t thee, leave there thy gift, fir&s;t be reconcil'd to thy
<PB N="4" REF="010181_0003_0F7D43388595A060">brother, and then come and offer thy gift;</HI> the expre&s;&s;ion being indefinite, doubtle&s;s extends to all the connections of mankind, in families, church and &s;tate; <HI>peacemakers</HI> therefore are &s;uch who are them&s;elves quiet and peacea|ble, who &s;incerely love peace and earne&s;tly endeavour in obedience to GOD, and regard to man to promote it, wherever their influence reaches, thro' the general &s;eries of their behaviour, by the u&s;e of all lawful means.</P>
<P>SUCH as duly con&s;ider the value of peace to &s;ociety, mu&s;t needs have a high e&s;teem of it, which naturally tends to excite proportional de&s;ire and labour; but with|out divine influence, we neither have an affecting view of things, or an ability to act with right principles and de&s;igns: a few peaceable moods and kind offices cannot con&s;titute a Peacemaker, for this includes the govern|ing temper of the &s;oul and general cour&s;e of the con|duct, the&s;e and nothing tran&s;ient, evidence the &s;tate of the mind, and determine the character.</P>
<P>THE extent of this duty is univer&s;al, <HI>if it be po&s;&s;ible,</HI> &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, <HI>as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men;</HI> not only with &s;uch as are of our profe&s;|&s;ion and &s;entiments, but with all others that retain the human &s;pecies, and if, thro' their default, our labours for peace prove abortive, neverthele&s;s we &s;hall not mi&s;s a gracious reward, which is not connected with the &s;ucce&s;s (that is out of our power) but with our di&s;po|&s;ition and endeavour.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah. lxix. 4.5.</NOTE> Yet when the&s;e are crown'd with &s;ucce&s;s, it is a tree of life!<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prov. xiii. 12.</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT tho' we are earne&s;tly to pro&s;ecute peace, yet not &s;o far as to barter truth and holine&s;s to obtain it, no! <HI>we mu&s;t buy the truth and not &s;ell it,</HI> we mu&s;t <HI>follow peace with all men,</HI> and <HI>holine&s;s;</HI> that is &s;o far as is con&s;i&s;tent
<PB N="5" REF="010181_0004_0F7D433942DD90F8">with holine&s;s, and no farther; we &s;hould rather die then deny the lea&s;t truth, but there is a wide diffe|rence between our love to it and our impo&s;ing of it as a term of communion upon others; the former is our duty, and the latter our &s;in.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiv. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd it is no ea&s;y matter to procure or pre&s;erve peace among mankind, for by our fatal apo|&s;tacy we have lo&s;t that pure light, &s;upream love to GOD, and &s;incere regard to man, which we enjoy'd in our primitive &s;tate; and in place thereof are under the governing power of darkne&s;s, enmity again&s;t GOD and man, and immoderate &s;elf love: &s;o that we neither know our duty in a right manner, or are willing to do it, but have a &s;trong pronene&s;s to the contrary: nothing le&s;s than &s;upernatural light and almighty power can &s;ub|due the&s;e evils in us, and qualify us to perform accep|tably the duty enjoyn'd in our text. Yea even after a change is wrought what infants are many in grace, <HI>they are carnal and walk as men, while there is envying, &s;trife, and divi&s;ions among them, while one &s;aith he is of Paul and another he is of Apollos; who is Paul and who is Apollos?</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. iii. 3.4.5.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE <HI>means</HI> tending to <HI>peace</HI> are either negative or po&s;itive, of the fir&s;t kind are the&s;e following, viz. ra&s;h|judging, un&s;criptural terms of communion, and uncha|ritable divi&s;ions; and</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. WE &s;hould with great care avoid <HI>ra&s;hjudging,</HI> which, on in&s;ufficient grounds, condemns the &s;tates and actions of others: this practice is as &s;inful in it&s;elf as unfriendly to the peace of &s;ociety, and therefore is &s;trictly prohibited and &s;everely cen&s;ur'd by God him&s;elf, as an inva&s;ion of his province, a de&s;pi&s;ing of our brother,
<PB N="6" REF="010181_0005_0F7D433986983B80">and an anticipation of the general judgment; <HI>who art thou that judge&s;t another man's &s;ervant? why do&s;t thou &s;et at nought thy brother? for we &s;hall all &s;tand before the judgment &s;eat of</HI> CHRIST; <HI>he that judgeth his brother, judgeth the law;</HI> i. e. accu&s;eth it of imperfection by condemning per&s;ons not for violating its precepts but his own additions; <HI>judge not</HI> &s;ays our LORD <HI>le&s;t ye be judged;</HI> i. e. le&s;t ye provoke others to recriminate and load you with invective; he may certainly expect to be judged without mercy who hath &s;hewed no mercy; the mo&s;t un&s;ullied innocence, the mo&s;t eminent and gene|rous goodne&s;s, are not &s;ecure from the cen&s;ure of this malignant impiety, which pre&s;umes to a&s;cribe a &s;eries of of good actions, without the lea&s;t &s;hadow of rea&s;on, to a bad cau&s;e and de&s;ign; thus the invidious <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> a&s;|cribed the miraculous works of our LORD to the power of the Devil, and repre&s;ented the Saviour of &s;inners not|with&s;tanding all his beneficent actions, as a rebel again&s;t the &s;tate.</P>
<P N="2">2d. IN order to procure and pre&s;erve peace, the <HI>offi|cers</HI> of <HI>churches</HI> &s;hould beware of <HI>adding</HI> on any pretext what&s;oever, <HI>new terms of communion</HI> of their own devi|&s;ing, to tho&s;e which the head of the church has fixed; for hereby his authority will be confronted and the church torn into innumerable parts, we have but <HI>one Lawgiver who is able to &s;ave and to de&s;troy.</HI> It is the bu|&s;ine&s;s and duty of church officers, to explain and obey the laws he has given, but they &s;hould not &s;tep into the legi&s;lator's chair. Now that the <HI>terms</HI> of <HI>&s;tated communion</HI> appointed by our LORD, are <HI>e&s;&s;entials</HI> in doctrine wor|&s;hip, and di&s;cipline, together with a regular life, is evi|dent, as I conceive, from the following places of &s;crip|ture, duly con&s;idered and compared, i. e. the 14 chapter of the Epi&s;tle of <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Romans</HI> throughout, is full to this purpo&s;e; here we are enjoyn'd to <HI>receive the weak,
<PB N="7" REF="010181_0006_0F7D433A368317E8">but not to doubtful di&s;putations,</HI> and to <HI>avoid judging and di&s;pi&s;ing them.</HI> Now by the <HI>weak,</HI> it is plain from the &s;e|ries of the context, that the Apo&s;tle means &s;uch per&s;ons who tho' &s;ound in the main points of faith, and &s;erious, hold &s;ome circum&s;tantial or le&s;&s;er errors, viz. that under the go&s;pel all are obliged to ab&s;tain from meats for|bidden by the Jewi&s;h law, and to keep their ceremonial Sabbaths: the&s;e the &s;trong or more orthodox part of the church, are neverthele&s;s obliged to receive to commu|nion; this precept is inforced by divers arguments, &s;uch as that they were &s;incere, and <HI>accepted of</HI> GOD, and that the <HI>&s;ub&s;tance</HI> of <HI>religion</HI> did not con&s;i&s;t in the&s;e things, but in <HI>peace, righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>joy in the Holy Gho&s;t; he that in the&s;e things &s;erveth</HI> CHRIST, &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, <HI>is acceptable to</HI> GOD, <HI>and approved of men: let us therefore follow after the things that make for peace, and things whereby we may edify one another; for meats de&s;troy not the work of</HI> GOD; i. e. do not break the peace of the church, and mar thy brother's edification, by uncharitable con|tentions and divi&s;ions about &s;mall and circum&s;tantial matters; <HI>if you have faith,</HI> about the&s;e things, <HI>have it to your&s;elves,</HI> dont impo&s;e your &s;entiments upon others, <HI>let every man be fully per&s;uaded in his own mind.</HI> Rom. xv. 1.7. <HI>we then that are &s;trong, ought to bear the infir|mities of the weak, and not plea&s;e our&s;elves; wherefore receive one another as</HI> CHRIST <HI>al&s;o received us to the glory of</HI> GOD. <Q>By the <HI>infirmities</HI> of the <HI>weak,</HI> we are to un|der&s;tand their ignorance, frowardne&s;s, and cen&s;oriou&s;|ne&s;s, he &s;peaks not of here&s;ies and manife&s;t enormities but of &s;uch errors in doctrine and life, which proceed from ignorance and common infirmity; with the&s;e we &s;hould bear, as we do with &s;ick per&s;ons in their way-wardne&s;s; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid.

Is that <HI>zeal</HI> according to knowledge, which is equal in degree for them all? or can any church make that truth a term of commu|nion, which CHRIST has not made, without claiming a power &s;uperior to his, viz of rejecting tho&s;e whom he commands us to receive? the ab&s;urdity and impie|ty

In this manner PERSECUTION di&s;graces the religion of JESUS, and tends to de&s;troy it entirely. As love is the incentive to love, &s;o is ha|tred to its contrary; both which actions &s;peak with the loude&s;t voice, and give the &s;tronge&s;t evidence; <HI>the wi&s;dom that is from above is fir&s;t pure, then peaceable, gentle, and ea&s;y to be entreated; full of mercy.</HI> (James iii. 17.) <HI>but if ye have bitter envying, and &s;trife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not again&s;t the truth; this wi&s;|dom de&s;cendeth not from above, but is earthly, &s;en&s;ual, de|vili&s;h;</HI> (James iii. 14.15.) certainly, <HI>the wrath of man, worketh not the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God.</HI> (James i. 20.21.) Seeing we mu&s;t an&s;wer to Jehovah for our conduct, and others cannot &s;creen us from his re&s;entment, is it not rational that we &s;hould <HI>examine</HI> and <HI>judge</HI> for our|&s;elves, and <HI>call no man father on the earth,</HI> in this re|&s;pect? and do not the &s;acred Scriptures enjoin the&s;e things upon us?

Now can it be with rea&s;on imagin|ed, that almighty GOD commands us to do thus, and yet in the mean time gives authority to any to puni&s;h or kill us for doing it, and for complying with our own judgment in matters purely religious, after the be&s;t enquiry we can make, or judgment we can form re|&s;pecting the meaning of his word? no &s;urely! for if this be the ca&s;e, JEHOVAH commands contradictions, and

The principles of candor, of ju&s;|tice, and a &s;incere regard to the churches of the Pro|te&s;tants, induce me to make this farther apology, for their entertaining per&s;ecuting principle in the begin|ing of the reformation, viz. that their attention was otherways diverted by a multiplicity of important la|bours, and that &s;cience did but then begin to dawn; and farther that the&s;e pious men had a mi&s;taken notion of the Jewi&s;h con&s;titution, (which was a Theocra&s;y that no other nation ever had) and imagined without foun|dation, that it gave the magi&s;tracy authority to puni&s;h erroneous per&s;ons; propagate religion by the civil &s;word; this is a melancholy blemi&s;h on the reformation from Popery, which brought great guilt, incon&s;i&s;tency, and ab&s;urdity upon the Prote&s;tant body; Romans ii. 1. <HI>Wherefore thou art inexcu&s;able O man, whoever thou art that judge&s;t, for wherein thou judge&s;t another thou con|demne&s;t thy&s;elf, for thou that judge&s;t do&s;t the &s;ame things.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;peak this of my Prote&s;tant fathers and brethren, with much &s;orrow of heart, and with many tears. It is in vain for any particular party of the Prote&s;tants to de|ny the charge; the confe&s;&s;ions of faith of all the nation|al churches, which put a &s;word in the magi&s;trate's hand to puni&s;h error, and compel a uniformity in religion by temporal pains and penalties, together with their act|ing upon this plan, as appears by divers awful facts, prove the charge. <HI>O that my head were waters and my eyes

<P>THE truth is, the fir&s;t reformers did many things well; they made a noble &s;tand again&s;t many important awful errors of the church of Rome, &s;uch as idolatry, dependence on works in the articles of ju&s;tification, and again&s;t divers &s;uper&s;titious and ridiculous ceremonies either of their own invention, or which they borrowed from their Pagan neighbours, whom they as meanly as incon&s;i&s;tently aped herein, though under the &s;peci|ous umbrage of chri&s;tian names.</P>
<P>THE reformers de&s;erve commendation, for the great &s;ervice they have done to religion, by their bold and gallant oppo&s;ition to the afore&s;aid abominations, and others of the like kind, though enforced by all the artillery of the church, in conjunction with the more formidable &s;word of the &s;tate; and for their carrying on the reformation &s;o far as they did; and we have great rea&s;on to ble&s;s GOD while we live for the good they have done, and for their de&s;ires that the reforma|tion might be carried on &s;till farther. They did not &s;et up them&s;elves as an ab&s;olute &s;tandard. If any of their po&s;terity have made this wicked u&s;e of them and their labour, they are to blame for this, and not the fir&s;t reformers.</P>
<P>BUT it is notwith&s;tanding matter of fact, that the&s;e worthy men have failed in &s;ome things of great im|portance, e&s;pecially in the&s;e, viz. that they did not oppo&s;e per&s;ecution root and branch wherever, whenever, or by whom&s;oever it is inflicted, whether Papi&s;t or Prote&s;tant, Jew, Turk, or Pagan; whether by the church or &s;tate, or by both in conjunction; and likewi&s;e that they divided among them&s;elves, and made their churches &s;eperate parties by inclo&s;ures of

<P>ARE Peacemakers ble&s;&s;ed, and &s;hall they be called the children of God? then by the law of contraries, we may learn, that &s;uch are in a dangerous &s;ituation who promote contention and divi&s;ion, who, in&s;tead of heal|ing breaches, widen them, and make new rents in the church of God, in&s;tead of covering the &s;in of their brethren, needle&s;sly expo&s;e and aggravate them, and perhaps add groundle&s;s charges to them, which have a tendency to mar their u&s;efulne&s;s and promote recrimination and confu&s;ion; what contracted and di&s;|tracted views of things mu&s;t &s;uch per&s;ons have, who prefer &s;mall things to great, minute points in &s;enti|ment to brotherly love, and to the peace and union of Chri&s;t's kingdom! who pretend to promote the good of the church, by that which directly tends to her en|tire ruin; I mean unnece&s;&s;ary divi&s;ions; if we bite and devour one another, we may expect to be con&s;umed one of another. Church purity in re&s;pect of doc|trine and the power of piety are no doubt de&s;irable and amiable, and ought to be promoted and pre&s;erved, but how? not by methods of our devi&s;ing, but by the u&s;e of &s;uch only as divine wi&s;dom has pre&s;cribed; a long tract of time has fully proved, that human contrivances in matters of religion, however well intended, have not an&s;wered their de&s;ign. Let us therefore &s;tand fa&s;t in the liberty wherewith Chri&s;t has made us free. When the zealous, but narrow minded, and over forward di&s;|ciples wanted to pluck up the tares, our Saviour forbid them, lea&s;t they &s;hould do injury to the wheat, and ordered that both &s;hould be &s;uffered to grow together till the harve&s;t, (Matthew xiii. 28. 30.)
