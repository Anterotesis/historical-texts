<HEAD>A DISCOURSE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent hour, to the con&s;ideration of which I am called by the honorable Tru&s;|tees of the Dudleian Lecture, was once e&s;teemed highly im|portant; but for many years its importance has been gradually le&s;&s;ening, partly through the candor and catholici&s;m which mark this enlightened age, and partly on account of the thorough di&s;qui&s;itions of the &s;ubject by the able&s;t hands. Every thing has already been &s;aid, that can be &s;aid directly in point. However, &s;ome im|perfect recapitulation of what has been learnedly and judiciou&s;ly ob&s;erved by the worthy gentlemen who have gone before me, together with &s;ome im|proving reflections, will be attempted at this time; attempted by <HI>one,</HI> who&s;e enfeebled age might have been alleged as &s;ufficient to excu&s;e him from any attempt of the kind.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="033857_0003_0FF9611871E2A140">
I have &s;elected as my &s;criptural guide, what you will read in Paul's Epi&s;tle to the</P>
<Q><BIBL><HI>PHILIPPIANS, i. 15&mdash;18.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Some indeed preach Chri&s;t of envy and &s;trife; and &s;ome al&s;o of good will: the one preach Chri&s;t of contention, not &s;incerely, hoping to add affliction to my bonds: but the other of love, knowing that I am &s;et for the defence of the go&s;pel. What then? notwith&s;tanding, ev|ery way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Chri&s;t is preached; and I therein do rejoice, and will rejoice.</P></Q>
<P>THE pa&s;&s;age is not greatly ob&s;cure: it needs no labored elucidation; but plainly imports, that St. Paul had fixed his main object: this object he ever held as principal, and to this every other mu&s;t give way. It was the publi&s;hing the pure go&s;pel of <HI>Je&s;us:</HI> it was to make known the riches of God's grace to a ruined world, through the power and grace of the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah. The apo&s;tle, in the pa&s;&s;age before us, would by no means give counte|nance to the vile principles and views of &s;ome who had undertaken to preach Chri&s;t&mdash;not of good will&mdash;not &s;incerely, but of pretence, and a malign intention to hurt his character, and in|crea&s;e the weight of his bonds; but not with&s;tand|ing this, as the go&s;pel was preached, was &s;pread|ing among the Gentiles, <HI>this</HI> was matter of great joy to our apo&s;tle. Some preached Chri&s;t of en|vy;
<PB N="5" REF="033857_0004_0FF9611F44DBBE70">that is, grudging Paul the honor paid him by tho&s;e who became Chri&s;tians by his mini&s;|try. Some preached Chri&s;t, that is, they preached the true doctrines of Chri&s;tianity, in &s;trife and contention, rai&s;ing di&s;putes again&s;t Paul, endeav|oring to le&s;&s;en his character as an apo&s;tle, and ob|&s;truct his benevolent labors in the mini&s;try. But, ble&s;&s;ed be God, there were others, who preached Chri&s;t of good will, or (as the Greek word &s;igni|fies) with good plea&s;ure, taking great delight in the truth and importance of the go&s;pel: the&s;e were indeed fellow-helpers unto the truth, and fellow-laborers with Paul in the &s;ame important work. Thus &s;tood the ca&s;e, when our apo&s;tle put the que&s;tion. What then? though there is &s;uch a mixture in the character of the pre&s;ent preachers of the &s;ame go&s;pel, &s;hall this prevent my joy and gratitude at the &s;preading of the go&s;pel? &s;hall this depreciate either the nature or importance of the truth it&s;elf? No, by no means: Chri&s;t is preach|ed: this is the main point in view, and therein I do rejoice, and will rejoice.</P>
<P>To methodi&s;e my thoughts on this occa&s;ion, I &s;hall con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">I. What is implied in preaching Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">II. To whom the preaching of Chri&s;t is com|mitted.</P>
<P N="3">III. The manner of their induction into office, and their equality therein.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Some of the unhappy effects of the jarring &s;entiments of profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians on this &s;ubject.
<PB N="6" REF="033857_0005_0FF96126892504C8">I &s;hall then</P>
<P N="5">V. Name &s;ome con&s;iderations which have a tendency to conciliate the hearts of Chri&s;tians, and regulate their conduct in regard to the &s;ub|ject before us.</P>
<P N="1">I. I am to con&s;ider what is implied in preach|ing Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>In general, to preach Chri&s;t, is to hold to public view, and comprehen&s;ively illu&s;trate, the te&s;ti|mony which God has given, both in the Old and New Te&s;tament, concerning <HI>him.</HI> It is to declare, not in words which man's wi&s;dom teaches, but which the Holy Gho&s;t teaches, the per&s;onal glories and amiable perfections of Chri&s;t, as the only be|gotten of the Father; the brightne&s;s of the Fa|ther's glory, and the expre&s;s image of his per&s;on; the chief among ten thou&s;and, and altogether lovely; fairer than the children of men, and infi|nitely higher than the princes of the earth, or an|gels in heaven: for divine perfections are a&s;cribed unto <HI>him;</HI> and in <HI>him</HI> dwelleth all the fulne&s;s of the <HI>Godhead</HI> bodily.</P>
<P>Again. To preach Chri&s;t is to publi&s;h, and as much as in us lies, to explain the nature of his me|diatorial offices, as they are repre&s;ented unto us in the word of God&mdash;to declare what he has done, and &s;uffered&mdash;what he is &s;till doing for us, as the one only Mediator between God and man. It is to exhibit <HI>him</HI> in <HI>our nature,</HI> the Mediator of the go&s;pel covenant, executing the offices of Prophet, Prie&s;t, and King.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="033857_0006_0FF9612D27CCB880">
He is the great Prophet &s;ent of God, whom God promi&s;ed to rai&s;e up like unto Mo&s;es, whom his peo|ple &s;hall hear. He has declared unto us the things which he has &s;een with the Father, revealing all things nece&s;&s;ary for our &s;alvation; &s;o that he who runs may read and under&s;tand the e&s;&s;entials of his religion.</P>
<P>Again. To preach Chri&s;t is to exhibit the &s;crip|ture account of his prie&s;tly character. It is to de|clare to the world his atoning &s;acrifice&mdash;that he has once &s;uffered for our &s;ins, the ju&s;t for the un|ju&s;t, that <HI>he</HI> might bring us unto God&mdash;that <HI>he</HI> is the great High-Prie&s;t of our profe&s;&s;ion, who has made reconciliation by the blood of the cro&s;s; and by one offering, has perfected forever them that are &s;ancti&s;ied. In this character of High-Prie&s;t, <HI>he</HI> is pa&s;&s;ed into the heavens, exalted to the right hand of the Maje&s;ty on high; and is able to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t, all that come to God by <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>Again. To preach Chri&s;t is to repre&s;ent <HI>him</HI> in the character of an Almighty Prince, who rules the nations in righteou&s;ne&s;s, and judgeth the people with equity; who&s;e kingdom is an everla&s;ting kingdom, and of who&s;e dominion there &s;hall be no end. God hath &s;et <HI>him</HI> upon his holy hill of Zion, given all power in heaven and earth into his me|diatorial hands. He has given <HI>him</HI> a name above every name, and to <HI>him</HI> every knee &s;hall bow, and every tongue confe&s;s, to the glory of God the Father, or Deity. He is the glorious King of his church: he claims the mo&s;t cheerful confidence in his royal care and grace, and ready obedience to all the laws
<PB N="8" REF="033857_0007_0FF96138D1009D88">of his kingdom. In a word, he enlightens, and in|tercedes for his church&mdash;he rules and defends it, and will keep it by his mighty power, through faith unto eternal &s;alvation.</P>
<P>Now to preach Chri&s;t is to publi&s;h and declare, to te&s;tify and di&s;play, according to the &s;criptures, the&s;e glories of his name, uncorrupted by the wi&s;|dom of this world&mdash;and repre&s;ent <HI>him</HI> under all the&s;e amiable and infinitely important characters.</P>
<P>But moreover, as Chri&s;t has &s;et before us his own example, that we &s;hould follow his &s;teps, and that the &s;ame mind &s;hould be in us which was al&s;o in <HI>him,</HI> to preach Chri&s;t therefore, is to relate the me|moirs of his holy life, and to con&s;ider his amiable and perfect moral character as delineated in the go&s;pel. He was holy, harmle&s;s, undefiled, and &s;ep|arate from &s;inners; <HI>he</HI> did no iniquity, neither was guile found in his mouth: in his per&s;on, in his examples and doctrines, he has &s;hewed the Fa|ther unto us, and taught us what is the good, the perfect and acceptable will of God. He was, in a mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed manner, an example for us in his fervent prayers, his regard to God's holy law, his contempt of the world, and benevolence to man|kind. His doctrine dropt as the dew, and di&s;tilled refre&s;hing as the &s;mall drops of the rain, while he was making known the way of life through faith in him, and repentance for the remi&s;&s;ion of all &s;ins; while he explained the former part of revelation, and e&s;|tabli&s;hed a new di&s;pen&s;ation, which &s;hall continue to the end of the world. He fairly and fully pro|pounded the terms of our reconciliation, and ex|hibited,
<PB N="9" REF="033857_0008_0FF9613BF78EA800">in a new and con&s;training light, the mo&s;t powerful motives to moral obedience. Now the preachers of Chri&s;t will endeavor, with a mo&s;t careful hand, to imitate their Divine Ma&s;ter, in the doctrines they teach, and the motives with which they inculcate the morality of the go&s;pel. In this &s;en&s;e, they will learn to call no man Ma&s;ter on earth, nor ever teach for doctrines the traditions of men: one is their Ma&s;ter in heaven, even Chri&s;t. They will avoid every attempt to &s;ave men's &s;ouls, on the one hand, by dry, empty ha|rangues, and metaphy&s;ical niceties; and, on the other, by warm effu&s;ions, and unfounded imag|inations of mi&s;guided zeal: they will not perplex their in&s;tructions by attempts to pry into tho&s;e &s;ecret things which belong only to God. But, in fine, they will teach and inculcate with the great|e&s;t diligence and care; they will pre&s;s home to men's con&s;ciences, in the plaine&s;t and warme&s;t lan|guage, the things which are mo&s;t plainly taught in the go&s;pel, mo&s;t in&s;i&s;ted upon by Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles, and repre&s;ented as of the highe&s;t impor|tance to the &s;ouls of men.</P>
<P>But I cannot di&s;mi&s;s this head without ob&s;erv|ing, that the gracious promi&s;e of the <HI>aiding Spirit,</HI> and the &s;ure hope of the re&s;urrection to eternal life, are important parts of that ble&s;&s;ed go&s;pel, which the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t have committed unto them, and nece&s;&s;arily implied in preaching Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The beloved Savior &s;ays, in his comforting fare|wel addre&s;s to his di&s;ciples, "I will pray the Fath|er, and he will &s;end the <HI>Comforter,</HI> the Holy
<PB N="10" REF="033857_0009_0FF96146E8046668">Gho&s;t, unto you; <HI>he</HI> &s;hall teach you all things." It is true, indeed, that the miraculous teachings of the Holy Gho&s;t, and that power by which the apo&s;tles wrought miracles, are not now to be ex|pected: however, the&s;e ought to be adduced, in the cla&s;s of miracles, as proof of the go&s;pel it&s;elf: but there is a gracious promi&s;e of his divine influ|ence, which is always to abide with Chri&s;tians. His enlightening, his &s;anctifying, his comforting influence will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">rawn, to the end of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> holy tem|ple in the Lord, through, or by the Spirit. In fine, my brethren, there is no doctrine in the New Te&s;tament more abundantly taught, than the importance of divine influence; or, the graces of the Holy Spirit in the all-glorious work of our redemption. It is true, the particu|lar modus, or preci&s;e manner of <HI>his</HI> influence on rational free agents, cannot be fully comprehend|ed. But the &s;ubject is well expre&s;&s;ed in that well|known exhortation of the apo&s;tle, "Work out your own &s;alvation with fear and trembling; for it is <HI>God</HI> who <HI>worketh</HI> in you both to <HI>will</HI> and to <HI>do</HI> of his own good plea&s;ure."</P>
<P>Again. The re&s;urrection, and the expre&s;s prom|i&s;e of eternal life to all true Chri&s;tians, are mark|ed with di&s;tingui&s;hed importance in the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. Life and immortality are brought to light by the go&s;pel. Chri&s;t is the re&s;urrection and the life. <HI>His</HI> doctrines, and e&s;pecially his <HI>re&s;|urrection</HI> from the dead, have thrown more than tenfold light on this &s;ubject above any the philo&s;|ophers could boa&s;t, or even the Jewi&s;h church were
<PB N="11" REF="033857_0010_0FF961C751BE28F8">favored with. The promi&s;e is ab&s;olute: "Who&s;o|ever believeth on me, though he were <HI>dead,</HI> yet &s;hall he live; I will rai&s;e him up at the la&s;t day:" "Becau&s;e I live, ye &s;hall live al&s;o." On the who&s;e all judgment is committed unto the Son; and the important day is marked in the divine irrevocable decree, when all who are in their graves &s;hall come forth; they who have done <HI>well,</HI> to the re&s;urrec|tion of life; and they who remain impenitent, to the re&s;urrection of &s;hame and contempt.</P>
<P>Thus, my re&s;pected friends, I have given a few important hints in regard to what is implied in preaching Chri&s;t. His character is drawn from God's own te&s;timony, and the &s;cripture account given directly in point. His per&s;onal glories, and mediatorial offices, his doctrines, his examples, his promi&s;es, and e&s;pecially, that of the Holy Gho&s;t, his own re&s;urrection, and his power to rai&s;e the dead, the judgment to come, and the important i&s;&s;ue of <HI>that</HI> all-intere&s;ting day, are <HI>all</HI> e&s;&s;ential parts of that go&s;pel which was preached by Paul and others, in the publication of which he greatly rejoiced.</P>
<P>I have dwelt the longer, my friends, on this head, that we might be appri&s;ed of the <HI>grounds</HI> and <HI>rea|&s;ons</HI> of the Apo&s;tle's rejoicing. Shall we not &s;ay with a believing heart, and adoring tongue, What tidings are the&s;e to a guilty, peri&s;hing world? Ti|dings publi&s;hed by the go&s;pel of Je&s;us! the prom|i&s;e of pardon, peace, and eternal life; for Chri&s;t of God is made to every one who repents of his &s;ins and believes this go&s;pel, wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctification, eternal life. Glory to God in the
<PB N="12" REF="033857_0011_0FF96154251A0048">highe&s;t, for there is on earth peace, and good will towards men. But we are now</P>
<P N="2">II. To con&s;ider to whom the preaching of this go&s;pel is committed.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ult the &s;acred oracles (and they &s;hall be my only guide) methinks we &s;hall not be at a lo&s;s for an an&s;wer. This go&s;pel was imperfectly and preparatively committed to the twelve di&s;ci|ples whom Chri&s;t &s;ent out to preach in all the cities and &s;uburbs of Jeru&s;alem, as you will &s;ee. Then to the &s;eventy, &s;ent on a like errand, and by the &s;ame authority. After this, and before the a&s;|cen&s;ion of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, this go&s;pel was largely and fully committed to the eleven di&s;ciples, in the mo&s;t gracious words, "And Je&s;us came and &s;pake unto them, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth: Go ye, therefore, and teach all na|tions, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t; teaching them to ob&s;erve all things what&s;oever I have com|manded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxviii. 18&mdash;20.</NOTE> On the day of Pen|teco&s;t, they were endued with the miraculous gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t, and this go&s;pel was preached by the apo&s;tles and by &s;uch as were by them ap|pointed to the great body of the Jewi&s;h nation, and afterwards by Paul and Barnabas to the Gen|tile nations; for the Holy Gho&s;t had &s;aid, "Separate me Paul and Barnabas to the work to which I have appointed them." Immediately after this, the preaching of this go&s;pel was <HI>committed</HI> to men, who are promi&s;cuou&s;ly &s;tyled, for more than two centu|ries,
<PB N="13" REF="033857_0012_0FF8D66F60092FE8"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">, <HI>Bi&s;hops, Pa&s;tors, Elders and Teachers.</HI> But this leads me</P>
<P N="3">III. To con&s;ider the manner of their induction, and their <HI>equality</HI> in office.</P>
<P>Here I &s;hall briefly ob&s;erve a few things, I hope &s;atisfactory to an unprejudiced, impartial inquirer. They were inaugurated or in&s;tated in this office by the authority of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; empowering tho&s;e who were already in office, by his &s;pecial di|rection, to commit to others the things which they had received in &s;olemn charge from him.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t account we have of a go&s;pel-ordination is recorded Acts xiii. 1&mdash;3. "There were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers: as they mini&s;tered to the Lord, and fa&s;t|ed, the Holy Gho&s;t &s;aid, Separate me Barnabas and Paul to the work whereunto I have called them: and when they had fa&s;ted, and laid hands on them, they &s;ent them away;" that is, to preach to the Gentiles, to &s;ettle churches, and organize them ac|cording to go&s;pel order. Here let us note, Barna|bas and Paul were called of God. Ought not all candidates for the mini&s;try to be inwardly called and moved by the Holy Gho&s;t, as well as called by the &s;uffrage of a church and people, to under|take this great work? All the parts mentioned in the New Te&s;tament as con&s;tituting the ordination &s;ervice were performed&mdash;impo&s;ition of hands&mdash; fa&s;ting&mdash;and prayer. And let us carefully remark, the <HI>ordainers</HI> were the <HI>prophets</HI> and <HI>teachers</HI> of the <HI>church</HI> of Antioch: the&s;e teachers were without doubt the ordinary pa&s;tors: they could not be bi&s;hops in the pre&s;ent Epi&s;copalian &s;en&s;e: for there
<PB N="14" REF="033857_0013_0FF96162076AD1A8">was a plurality of them in this <HI>one</HI> church; how|ever in the &s;en&s;e of the two fir&s;t centuries, the&s;e prophets and teachers were called Bi&s;hops, Pre&s;|byters, and Elders.</P>
<P>But I pa&s;s to note their <HI>equality</HI> in office: for if all are equal, then the que&s;tion is at an end; be|cau&s;e all then have the &s;ame power of ordination.</P>
<P>Let it be remarked, that the apo&s;tles, con&s;idered as the fir&s;t preachers under this new di&s;pen&s;ation, received their authority from Chri&s;t; they were equally &s;ent to preach the &s;ame go&s;pel, and to gather and &s;ettle on the &s;ame model, churches among the Jews and Gentiles in all parts of the world, to appoint them officers, both for in&s;truc|tion and government: the&s;e were to be perpetu|ated in the churches, for their edification in faith and holine&s;s till the &s;econd coming of Chri&s;t. Now the apo&s;tles, in virtue of this power, received im|mediately from Chri&s;t, con&s;tituted no more than <HI>one</HI> order of &s;tanding officers in the church (ex|cepting the order of deacons, with whom we have nothing to do in the point before us.) In proof of this, let us ob&s;erve&mdash;neither Chri&s;t nor any of his apo&s;tles have given any in&s;tructions de&s;criptive of any per&s;ons &s;it for the work of the mini&s;try, adapted to any inequality or difference in the pa&s;|toral office. Had there been any difference like that which is now pretended, different qualifica|tions would have been required, in order to di&s;|charge the different tru&s;ts ari&s;ing from &s;uch dif|ferent offices; but the holy &s;criptures no where intimate that &s;uch different tru&s;ts are nece&s;&s;ary; very far from this, my brethren, they have point|ed out the qualifications of <HI>one order</HI> only, under
<PB N="15" REF="033857_0014_0FF961EC4CB069C0">the common name of Pre&s;byters, Bi&s;hops, Pa&s;tors, and Elders, as you will &s;ee at large in the Epi&s;tles to Timothy and Titus.</P>
<P>It is farther to be ob&s;erved, that the &s;criptures no where &s;o much as hint that any difference is to be made, in the manner of ordaining or charging mini&s;ters, as though there were any di&s;tinction in their office. They are not in a &s;ingle in&s;tance in|&s;tructed to exerci&s;e their ordaining or charging power adapted to di&s;tinct orders, as though they were to place &s;ome in a higher, and &s;ome in a low|er rank. There is not a word that intimates any thing like this. Nay, my friends, the &s;criptures pre&s;ent to view a directory for the ordination of one order only. Will you turn to and well con|&s;ider St. Paul's in&s;tructions re&s;pecting the &s;ettle|ment of the churches in <HI>Crete?</HI> Titus was left by Paul in this i&s;land, on purpo&s;e to &s;et in order the things that were wanting; that is, to ordain fixed pa&s;tors in the &s;everal churches there. Were the&s;e pa&s;tors differently de&s;cribed? Were &s;ome endow|ed with extraordinary gifts and exalted power above their brethren? Not a word of this: they were exactly of the &s;ame rank. Titus could com|mit nothing different to them; for he had re|ceived nothing different from Paul.</P>
<P>To our point al&s;o is the in&s;cription of Paul to the Philippians, i. 1. "To all the &s;aints which are at Philippi, with the <HI>bi&s;hops</HI> and deacons." No go&s;pel pa&s;tors but of one order are here mentioned; the&s;e are called <HI>bi&s;hops.</HI> But ob&s;erve, the&s;e could not be &s;uch bi&s;hops as are now contended for by the Church of England; for there was a plurality in the &s;ame church; which, as the venerable Dr.
<PB N="16" REF="033857_0015_0FF96172CD901F48">Chauncy well ob&s;erves, is a flat contradiction to that e&s;&s;ential article in the Epi&s;copal &s;cheme, <HI>"One church one bi&s;hop."</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall mention one in&s;tance more, which I think full in point: you will read it, 1 Peter, i. 1. The apo&s;tle directs this epi&s;tle to the Chri&s;tians &s;cat|tered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, A&s;ia, and Bithynia. Had this apo&s;tle known any di&s;|tinction of order, he would no doubt have noticed it: &s;urely he would not have overlooked the higher and more honorable order. But in&s;tead of this, he mentions only &s;uch pa&s;tors as were of equal rank; and expre&s;sly urges <HI>them</HI> to the faith|ful di&s;charge of their duty, as officers in the church. "The elders that are among you, I exhort, feed the flock of God." Likewi&s;e the direction given by James, v. 14. "Is any &s;ick among you? let him call for the <HI>elders (elders</HI> plural) of the church, and let them pray over them," &amp;c. In a word, they have all received their authority from the &s;ame hand, they are called to the &s;ame work, and they are charged in the &s;ame language; and they are expre&s;sly charged to call no man Ma&s;ter on earth, for one is their Ma&s;ter in heaven. But I cannot omit a pa&s;&s;age which I think of great weight in this di&s;pute. It is from our Lord's own mouth, Luke xxii. 24, &amp;c. There was al&s;o a &s;trife among them, which of them &s;hould be counted greate&s;t. Ob&s;erve the&s;e were the twelve di&s;ciples. The di&s;pute was, which of them &s;hould be greate&s;t in that kingdom of the Me&s;&s;iah, which they thought ju&s;t at hand. Chri&s;t grants he was about to &s;et up a kingdom, and that they &s;hould be offi|cers in his kingdom; but corrects their mi&s;take
<PB N="17" REF="033857_0016_0FF96203CACE6F08">about a preference and &s;uperiority one above an|other. He &s;ays, "The kings of the Gentiles exer|ci&s;e lord&s;hip over them; and they that exerci&s;e authority upon them are called their benefactors;" that is, are flattered with high titles;&mdash;"but ye &s;hall not be &s;o: but he that is greate&s;t among you," is fond of being exalted above his brethren,&mdash; let him check his ambitious views, and learn to conform more to the meek and humble &s;pirit of my go&s;pel;&mdash;"let him be as the younger, (or as it might be rendered) let him be as the lea&s;t; and he that is chief (that is, would be thought chief), let him be as one that doth &s;erve."</P>
<P>Thus, my brethren, all who enter upon the go&s;|pel mini&s;try &s;hould preach Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Lord, and them&s;elves equal <HI>&s;ervants</HI> of men's &s;ouls for Chri&s;t's &s;ake.</P>
<P>The&s;e imperfect hints mu&s;t &s;uffice, that I may have a few minutes ju&s;t to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="4">IV. A few of the unhappy effects of the jarring &s;entiments of profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>If I mi&s;take not, this dividing &s;pirit began to work as early as the apo&s;tolic age. I am of Paul, I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, was the language in the mouth of the church at Corinth. The reproof from Paul's own mouth is very in&s;tructive: "Who is Paul, and who is Apollos, but mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, and fellow-workers in the kingdom of Chri&s;t? Was Paul crucified for you?" &amp;c.</P>
<P>This &s;ame &s;pirit mo&s;t certainly laid the founda|tion of the great Papal apo&s;tacy and hierarchy. They originated by &s;mall beginnings. Fir&s;t a claim was laid in for metropolitan dignity; next,
<PB N="18" REF="033857_0017_0FF96185A7465240">dioce&s;an importance; and &s;o, &s;tep by &s;tep, till the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;ted &s;ucce&s;&s;or of St. Peter claimed infallibility and &s;upremacy over all pa&s;tors and churches through the whole world; and even kings and potentates counted it an honor to have their au|thority &s;anctioned by him.</P>
<P>To this unhappy di&s;pute, in its principles and progre&s;s, are to be a&s;cribed tho&s;e rivers of Chri&s;tian blood, &s;hed by the hands of mo&s;t cruel per&s;ecu|tors. This clothed the three witne&s;&s;es in &s;ackcloth, and drove them into the wilderne&s;s. At length the Prote&s;tant reformation took place. Was the di&s;pute then at an end? Alas, no; the &s;ame &s;pirit of party zeal for rank in a national church greatly ob&s;tructed the reformation, and marred much of its glory. Nor did it cea&s;e its baneful influence, till the rage for uniformity drove more than two thou&s;and faithful pa&s;tors from their pul|pits and beloved flocks. Yes, my friends, this bani&s;hed our re&s;pected ance&s;tors from their native country, and many of them from fair habitations and opulent circum&s;tances. They &s;ought, they found an <HI>a&s;ylum</HI> in the&s;e inho&s;pitable wilds. Thus a part of Chri&s;t's church has been in mo&s;t humil|iating and afflicted circum&s;tances, ari&s;ing from the unhappy mi&s;takes and bigotry of tho&s;e, who nev|erthele&s;s call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians. But, like the &s;acred bu&s;h, his church, though burning, has not been con&s;umed.</P>
<P>In this happy land our fathers planted the tree of Chri&s;tian liberty, and though it has not always been cultured by their hand as it ought, yet, un|der the divine cultivation, and by the wonderful
<PB N="19" REF="033857_0018_0FF96219A4861900">providence of God, it has at length &s;ent forth its boughs unto the rivers, and its branches unto the &s;eas.</P>
<P>But per&s;ecution and blood&s;hed &s;tand not alone as the &s;ad effects of the di&s;pute in hand; there are things pernicious in them&s;elves, and fatal in their con&s;equences, which ought to be ranked with them. What unchri&s;tian altercations have taken place among Chri&s;tians profe&s;&s;ing for &s;ub&s;tance the &s;ame faith and hope! what alienation of affec|tion! what divi&s;ions, &s;eparating very brethren! what terms of reproach! Bitter words, like drawn &s;words, again&s;t &s;ome who&s;e labors have been crown|ed with remarkable &s;ucce&s;s! They have felt the empha&s;is of the apo&s;tle's words, "cruel mockings."</P>
<P>Again. This has deprived the Chri&s;tian church of the mini&s;terial labors of many hopeful youth, who were devoting them&s;elves, and were de&s;igned to &s;erve in the go&s;pel as pa&s;tors and teachers. The fact is notorious. Many have gone into &s;ecular branches of life&mdash;have turned their attention to oth|er pur&s;uits, abandoning their fir&s;t pious choice of the mini&s;try, merely becau&s;e they could not &s;ub&s;cribe to the terms of their admi&s;&s;ion into the mini&s;try.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add&mdash;The&s;e unhappy divi&s;ions, and their con&s;equent effects, have furni&s;hed dei&s;ts, and all the enemies of Chri&s;tianity, with their mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful weapons.</P>
<P>Behold, &s;ay they triumphantly, behold how boa&s;ted Chri&s;tianity is torn in pieces by her own &s;ons! She is like a hou&s;e, a kingdom divided again&s;t it&s;elf, which cannot &s;tand. Tho&s;e very Chri&s;tians are not agreed who &s;hall be the publi&s;h|ers of this good news from <HI>heaven.</HI> See how they bite, defame, and devour one another! It is
<PB N="20" REF="033857_0019_0FF96193B08B8D20">thus we would have it! How unju&s;t and unfair their rea&s;oning is, has been often demon&s;trated by the advocates for Chri&s;tianity; and we tru&s;t, we hope, we pray, that their triumphing will be &s;hort.</P>
<P>We are very happy, on this occa&s;ion, to have in our power to &s;ay, that many of the &s;ad con&s;e|quences of this di&s;pute which we have been enu|merating, are <HI>rapidly</HI> on the decline: &s;ome have totally cea&s;ed. A &s;pirit of catholici&s;m and candor has now taken the ground long occupied by ig|norance and bigotry. A &s;pirit of univer&s;al <HI>tole|ration</HI> is approved and cheri&s;hed. We cordially embrace our re&s;pected Epi&s;copalian brethren, and e&s;teem many of them highly for their work's &s;ake, though differing in &s;entiments on the &s;ubject be|fore us; and there are a re&s;pectable number who tender <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;ame Chri&s;tian embrace. Would to Heaven it was univer&s;al.</P>
<P>Permit me now in the clo&s;e of this too lengthy di&s;cour&s;e,</P>
<P N="5">V. To hint a few things tending to conciliate the hearts of Chri&s;tians, and regulate their con|duct in regard to the &s;ubject before us.</P>
<P>Are we not all agreed in the e&s;&s;ential articles of Chri&s;tianity? Do we not all profe&s;s for &s;ub&s;tance, one faith, one bapti&s;m, one Lord, one Mediator, one God and Father of us all? Are we not all placed under one glorious Head, and hold in hope the <HI>&s;ame heaven?</HI> May not Chri&s;t be preached with|out <HI>at all</HI> intermeddling with the di&s;pute before us? Let us then love as brethren; let us carefully wave, both in preaching and in our private walks, whatever has a tendency to alienate our affection,
<PB N="21" REF="033857_0020_0FF9623414F54BA0">le&s;&s;en our candor, or continue any di&s;putes; di&s;|putes which have already been much too long in the church.</P>
<P>Let us never forget, that <HI>infallibility</HI> belongs not to human kind. "Humanum e&s;t errare." Here we all &s;ee darkly through a gla&s;s. Po&s;itive nice|ties, and dogmatical boa&s;ts, are not the marks of wi&s;dom, but of a young or weak mind. As our opponents may be mi&s;taken, are we &s;ure there are no mi&s;takes with us? Let us then make large al|lowances for the prejudice of education, the cu&s;|toms and manners of different &s;ocieties, and the imperfect manner in which all view the different &s;ides of the que&s;tion in di&s;pute. Let us meet one another as far as is con&s;i&s;tent with a good con|&s;cience. Let us bear one another's burdens, and &s;o fulfil the law of Chri&s;t. To endeavor to out|preach our opponents, and, if po&s;&s;ible, go beyond them in living what we preach, is not pride, but laudable Chri&s;tian emulation; and happy will it be for us, if, in&s;tead of appealing to them for our authority to preach, we are able to addre&s;s our people in the language of the apo&s;tle, "Ye are our epi&s;tle, written in our hearts, known and read of all men: for as much as ye are manife&s;tly declared to be the epi&s;tle of Chri&s;t, mini&s;tered by us; writ|ten not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of &s;tone, but in fle&s;hly tables of the heart."</P>
<P>Let us avail our&s;elves of the &s;pirit which breathes in our <HI>happy con&s;titution.</HI> It removes far from view much of the &s;pirit of the times of which we have been &s;peaking; it frowns on bigotry and tyranny of every kind; it cheri&s;hes rational liberty, virtue,
<PB N="22" REF="033857_0021_0FF961A3304AE270">and all the &s;ocial affections. Let us then hold it dearer to us than thou&s;ands of &s;ilver and gold. As it is the price of very much of our fathers' blood and trea&s;ure, O! may it be guarded as the apple of our eye, from every foe, dome&s;tic or foreign, and be tran&s;mitted unimpaired to our children, and theirs, to the late&s;t generation.</P>
<P>The &s;ure word of prophecy, and benevolent Chri&s;tianity, lead us to look a little forward, to times more happy than any the world has yet ex|perienced; when di&s;cords and contentions of ev|ery kind &s;hall utterly cea&s;e; when we &s;hall all "&s;ee eye to eye;" when there &s;hall be no more occa&s;ion for any one to &s;ay, "Know the Lord, for all &s;hall know him." Can we fail to join in this ardent petition&mdash;Lord, ha&s;ten on the&s;e mo&s;t glori|ous times; accompli&s;h the&s;e divine prophecies; fulfil that good word on which thou ha&s;t cau&s;ed thy &s;ervants to hope: even &s;o, Lord Je&s;us, come quickly.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be permitted to addre&s;s one word to the dear Youth, members of this re&s;pected Univer&s;ity; e&s;pecially to &s;uch as are de&s;igned to be employed in preaching Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>Need I, my dear young friends, remind you of the preciou&s;ne&s;s of time, and the talents now in your hands? The&s;e you will carefully improve; once neglected, they are irretrievably lo&s;t! and you will mourn at the la&s;t, &s;aying, "How have I hated in&s;truction, and my heart de&s;pi&s;ed reproof!" It is pre&s;umed you will endeavor to increa&s;e your <HI>fund</HI> of knowledge day by day, that you may <HI>all</HI> be pre|pared to act your part well in the callings in which you may be placed in manly age.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="033857_0022_0FF9624B21D09DC0">
But to you, e&s;pecially, who are intentionally can|didates for the go&s;pel mini&s;try, permit me to &s;ay, Study to be, in a &s;en&s;e, independent of all books but the Holy Bible, while you carefully read &s;uch helps as are in your way: tru&s;t to none but the Book of God&mdash;with that in your hand, prayerfully peru&s;ed, &s;y&s;temi&s;e for your&s;elves&mdash;to the law and to the te&s;timony&mdash;and let a&mdash;<HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord</HI>&mdash; decide all.</P>
<P>You will not forget, that while there are differ|ences in &s;entiment concerning the manner in which you are to be inducted into the go&s;pel mini&s;try, there is no di&s;pute at all upon this great point, viz. That all power is derived from Chri&s;t, and is by him delegated to per&s;ons of a particular char|acter, and is to be employed by <HI>them</HI> for the edifi|cation of the church. Beware, then, of "run|ning before you are &s;ent," and of pu&s;hing your|&s;elve immediately forward into the de&s;k. Let mode&s;ty and candor be traits in your early life, and they will not for&s;ake you when you are old: mode&s;ty and candor blo&s;&s;oming in youth, will grow with your growth, and bring forth ripe fruit in age.</P>
<Q><L>Age teaches candor, and expands the &s;oul,</L>
<L>Rejects the bigot, to embrace the whole;</L>
<L>Where virtue &s;hines, and ruling pa&s;&s;ions reign,</L>
<L>To guard from &s;in, and heav'nly hope obtain:</L>
<L>It frowns on all who dare pre&s;ume to bound</L>
<L>God's ways to man by their own narrow round.</L></Q>
<P>Inducted, you will fix your main attention on the chief object of your inini&s;try&mdash;you will preach not your&s;elves, but Chri&s;t Je&s;us, your Lord&mdash;&s;tudy to make your&s;elves approved in the &s;ight of God
<PB N="24" REF="033857_0023_0FF8D669D6CE2A50">and man&mdash;pray always&mdash;pray fervently, e&s;pecially for the &s;acred aids of the Divine Spirit, and the Lord &s;end you good &s;ucce&s;s, and give you un|der&s;tanding in all things; then, in&s;tead of the fa|thers, will be the children, and long, long after we, the fathers, &s;hall be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from our labors and &s;leep in the du&s;t, you will clo&s;e life well, and hear from our common Lord that ble&s;&s;ed euge pronounced on you, Well done, good and faithful &s;ervants, enter into the joy of your Lord.</P>
<P>And now, <HI>adieu&mdash;Dear Alma Mater, adieu.</HI> May <HI>you</HI> long remain an ornament to our <HI>ri&s;ing empire</HI>&mdash;our <HI>happy Republic</HI>&mdash;may you nurture and &s;end forth many &s;ons, trained in the paths of vir|tue, and the mo&s;t important branches of literature, pillars to the &s;tate, and able mini&s;ters of the New Te&s;tament. Thus may you be to the end of time a nur&s;ing mother both to the church and &s;tate.</P>
<P>My affectionate wi&s;h, and fervent prayer, will ever be&mdash;that the Benefactors, Governors, and In&s;tructors of this mo&s;t re&s;pectable Univer&s;ity may have the riche&s;t of Heaven's ble&s;&s;ings re&s;ting in all their bo&s;oms; and at la&s;t, meet a glorious remun|eration of all their charities, labors, and cares in the world of everla&s;ting felicity&mdash;to which happy world may God conduct us all, through the grace that is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord.&mdash;AMEN.</P>
