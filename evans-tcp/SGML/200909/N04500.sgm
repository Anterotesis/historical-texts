<P>_THE Title &s;hews that this is a P&s;alm of <HI>David,</HI> who was one of the greate&s;t Saints, and the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed General of the Age; he &s;pead his Conque&s;t far and wide, he was an early and renowned Hero, and as he grew in Experience, and a more exten&s;ive Command, he became more
<PB N="2" REF="005584_0006_10269258E63952F8">remarkable and Illu&s;trious. His Kingdom at fir&s;t was mainland Territory, without any Sea-Port or Navigation, but by his Conque&s;ts he extended his Dominions from Sea to Sea, even to the River that is from the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> to the Red-Sea, and to the River the great River <HI>Euphrates;</HI> &s;o that what was &s;aid of the City of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> on another Occa&s;ion, <HI>Dan.</HI> 11.45. by way of Allu&s;ion, may be applied to <HI>David, And he &s;hall plant the Tabernacles of his Palace between the Seas in the glorious holy Mountain.</HI></P>
<P>We have an Account of <HI>David</HI>'s Conque&s;ts and Victory's, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 8. <HI>v.</HI> 1, 2, 3. <HI>And after this it came to pa&s;s that David &s;mote the Phili&s;tines, and &s;ubdued them, and took Metheg-ammah out of the Hand of the Phili&s;tines. Metheg-ammah,</HI> that is the Bridle of <HI>Ammah,</HI> or according to our modern Way of &s;peaking, a Key of the Country, as <HI>Pelu&s;ium</HI> was to <HI>Egypt,</HI> and as <HI>Loui&s;hourg</HI> is to <HI>Canada.</HI> V. 2. <HI>And he &s;mote Moah, and mea&s;ured them with a Line, ca&s;ting them down to the Ground: Even with two Lines mea&s;ured he to put to Death, and with one full Line to keep alive.</HI> Ver. 3. <HI>David al&s;o &s;mote Hadadezer the Son of Rehob, King of Zobah, as he went ot recover his Border at the River Euphrates.</HI> Ver. 5. <HI>When the Syrians of Da|ma&s;cus came to &s;uccour Hadadezer King of Zobah, David &s;tew the Syrians Two and twenty Thou&s;and

<PB N="4" REF="005584_0008_1026925E37043698">a very extraordinary Repre&s;entation, &s;ome have endeavoured to &s;olve the Difficulty by &s;aying that it is probable that we do not know exactly what a Talent is; but this Solution doth not &s;eem &s;ufficient to remove the Diffi|culty; for in the fir&s;t Place the amount or greatne&s;s of the Sum ari&s;ing from the known Quantity of what a Talent makes, is the Dif|ficulty: We would remove this Difficulty by &s;aying, that we may be mi&s;taken about a Talent, or that we don't know what a Talent is. What &s;eems to be a rational and probable An&s;wer to this Objection is, that whereas we find in the account of the&s;e matters, that there is a careful Di&s;tinction maintained in the Scrip|tures between Gold and fine Gold; by Gold we are to under&s;tand Gold in the Oar, and fine Gold is Gold when purified or refined; it is probable that when the Ships were &s;ent to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, they might dig the Oar, &s;tow it in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">, and re&s;ine it there, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> the &s;horte&s;t and mo&s;t natural Way we can think of: The be&s;t Oars both of Gold and Silver, yield but one &s;ixth Part of refined Silver or Gold; when it is con&s;idered in this Light, this reducing it to one &s;ixth Part brings it down to &s;uch a Sum as one may rationally &s;uppo&s;e that a Prince who had made many Conque&s;ts, and carried on a great Trade, might provide and lay up for a De&s;ign in
<PB N="5" REF="005584_0009_1026926011B0A7F0">which his Heart was much engaged: But to return from this Digre&s;&s;ion: <HI>Solomon, David</HI>'s Succe&s;&s;or, increa&s;ed and enlarged the Trade &s;till more, he &s;ent great Fleets, and made va&s;t Returns, 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 10.22. <HI>In his Days Silver was nothing accounted of, for the King had at Sea a Navy of Tar&s;hi&s;h with the Navy of Hiram, once in three Years came the Navy of Tar&s;hi&s;h, bringing Gold, Silver, Ivory, and Apes and Peacocks: So King Solomon exceeded all the Kings of the Earth for Riches and for Wi&s;dom:</HI> And Ver. 27. <HI>And the King made Silver to be in Jeru&s;alem as Stones, and Cedars made he to be as the Sycomore Trees, that are in the Vale, for abundance.

It may be laid down as a Rule, that ordinarily no Kingdom, State or Province will ever ad|vance to any con&s;iderable Degree of temporal Greatne&s;s, Polity, Power and Influence, with|out Trade and Navigation: It was this, together with the Situation natural and artificial

<P>PROP. 1. That GOD hath &s;hewed us his mar|velous Kindne&s;s, in conducting and &s;ucceeding our late Expedition in the &s;trong City.</P>
<P>PROP. 2. That for &s;uch marvellous Kindne&s;s, we ought to be very thankful, and ble&s;s the LORD.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. <HI>GOD hath &s;hewed us his marvellous Kind|ne&s;s in what concerneth the late Expedition, by di&s;po&s;ing the Minds of the Country to ingage in that Affair with &s;uch Ardor and Zeal.</HI> When the Expedition was projected and &s;et on foot, the chief of our Colonies, and His Excellency Governour <HI>Shirley,</HI> who under GOD, was the Spring of that Motion, when he &s;ent his Pro|po&s;als, with a general Plan of the Operation to the other Governments, publick Bodies and private Per&s;ons appeared mightily di&s;po&s;ed to engage in the important Affair; thus it may be &s;aid as with Re&s;pect to King <HI>David,</HI> in a great
<PB N="10" REF="005584_0014_1026926B559C8C08">Affair he had to tran&s;act, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Sam.</HI> 19.14. <HI>And he bowed the Heart of all the Men of Judah, even as the Heart of one Man.</HI> High and Low, Rich and Poor concurred in the &s;ame Senti|ment; if any were otherways di&s;po&s;ed, yet they were borne down with the &s;trong Torrent of a general Inclination.</P>
<P>If the upper Orders of Men had not concur|red, the Expedition mu&s;t have failed; if the lower Ranks of Men had not been &s;trongly en|gaged, the grand De&s;ign mu&s;t have come to nothing: So that we &s;ee that the Head cannot &s;ay to the Foot, I have no need of you: All Orders and Degrees of Men were &s;o united that there was no Schi&s;m in the Body.</P>
<P>Such was the united Inclination of People in <HI>New-England,</HI> that notwith&s;tanding the great Charge of &s;uch an Undertaking, and their own Poverty, yet as the Apo&s;tle &s;aith, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 8.2. <HI>Their deep Poverty abounded unto the Riches of their Liberality: For to their Power (I bear Record) and beyond their Power, they were willing of them&s;elves.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Another In&s;tance of GOD'S marvellous Kindne&s;s in what concerns the late Expedition, was, <HI>That what was Concerted and Projected here, was Acceptable and well Approved by the gover|ning Powers in</HI> GREAT. BRITAIN: We found favour in the &s;ight of the King and His Nobles.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="005584_0015_1026926F1B2E9A58">The Packquet-Boat had a &s;afe Pa&s;&s;age, altho' it was in the depth of Winter; the Me&s;&s;enger had a favourable An&s;wer from the Board, and (as we have h&egrave;ard) was di&s;patch'd in Twelve Hours; Ships were ordered to a&s;&s;i&s;t in that Expedition. But what is an In&s;tance of marvellous Kindne&s;s was this, That before that time, Commodore <HI>Warren</HI> (who&s;e coming was agreeable to the Wi&s;hes and united De&s;ires of the whole Country) had received Orders to come with his Squa|dron of Ships here to this Country; had this Order been &s;ent after the Me&s;&s;enger &s;ent from hence did Arrive, it mu&s;t in the common cour&s;e of Things, have been too late; had the Enemy's Store-Ships entred and &s;upply'd the City, this would have rendred the Reduction of the Place difficult, if not impracticable: The Ship <HI>Vigilant</HI> was large, in all probability it would have proved that her Sides were too thick, and her Metal too heavy for our &s;mall Shipping. That the <HI>Commodore</HI> &s;hould be Ordered hither before our de&s;igned Epedi|tion was known to them who gave that Order, is a wonderful Providence; it is GOD'S Wi&s;|dom and not Man's that did direct: <HI>This is the LORD'S Doings, and it is Marvellous in our Eyes,</HI> P&s;al. 118.23.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="12" REF="005584_0016_102692719FD6E8D0">
3. Another In&s;tance of GOD'S marvellous Kindne&s;s, was, <HI>That the Affair was managed and carried on with &s;uch Secre&s;y, that it was not known to the Enemy, nor &s;o much as &s;u&s;|pected.</HI> Very much of the Affair was concer|ted, agitated, and carried on in the Winter Sea&s;on, in a dead Time of the Year, when there is but little Communication either by Sea or Land: Yet after all, we and our Ene|mies being upon the &s;ame Continent, it is of GOD'S Kindne&s;s, nay, it is an In&s;tance of his <HI>Marvellous</HI> Kindne&s;s that this important De&s;ign was hid from them; it was hid from them even a long time after the Expedition was over, &s;o that after the &s;trong Place was Sur|rendred, they came boldly there as to their own Home; were En&s;nared and Taken with|out having opportunity to &s;trike one Stroke: Their ca&s;e was not unlike to that of the <HI>Syrians,</HI> of whom the Prophet &s;aid, <HI>Smite them with blindne&s;s,</HI> 2 King. 6.18. &mdash; <HI>And He &s;mote them with blindne&s;s, &mdash; And he &s;aid follow me; but he led them to Samaria, and they &s;aw and be|held they were in the mid&s;t of Samaria.</HI> That an Affair of this nature, known to &s;o many, about which there mu&s;t be many imployed, and &s;o much done in Preparation for the Ex|pedition, it is marvellous that the Enemy did by no means come to the Knowlege of it; when it was commonly &s;aid among our &s;elves,
<PB N="13" REF="005584_0017_10269273681951E0">That the Enemy knew it 'ere this time: One &s;aith to another, The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> can never keep a Secret! Well, I believe that before this time, that the <HI>French</HI> at <HI>Canada</HI> and <HI>Cape-Breton</HI> know all the Affair as well as we. But GOD hath dealt with us not only better than we de&s;erve, but even better than our fears: there|fore we may &s;ay, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be the LORD, who hath &s;hewed us his marvellous Kindne&s;s in a &s;trong City.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Another In&s;tance of marvellous Kind|ne&s;s in what concerns the late Expedition, was, <HI>The fitne&s;s of the Weather for &s;uch an Under|taking.</HI> It was fine Weather for a long time beyond what was u&s;ual at that time of the Year, nay, beyond what was ever known. In ordering the Sea&s;on, human Skill fails, and Strength can do nothing: It is GOD who commands the Winds and the Seas and they obey him. Had not GOD had the Winds in his Fi&s;t, and bound up the Waters as in a Garment, how difficult, how dangerous the Navigation? Had GOD <HI>&s;ent,</HI> nay, had he not prevented the u&s;ual Storms of the Sea&s;on and the Roughne&s;s of the Sea, a great Fleet of Tran&s;ports mu&s;t have been greatly Expo&s;ed: Had not GOD appeared for them, that mu&s;t have been their ca&s;e, which we find painted in &s;uch lively Colours, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 107.25. <HI>For he
<PB N="14" REF="005584_0018_10269276C69D0228">commandeth and rai&s;eth the &s;tormy Wind, which lifteth up the Waves thereof; they mount up to Heaven, they go down again to the Dephts; their &s;oul is melted becau&s;e of Trouble? they reel to and fro and &s;tagger like a drunked Man, and are at their wits end.</HI> Our Forces were not only favoured with good Weather in their Pa&s;&s;age, but al&s;o when they lay Incamped, which was a marvellous Kindne&s;s; e&s;pecially con&s;idering the early Sea&s;on, the coldne&s;s of the Climate and the length of the Siege: And what is very remarkable, immediately upon the Surrendry of the Place, the Heavens gathered to blackne&s;s, Rain and Cold: Stormy Weather and Goggs was in abundance, and continued long &s;uch, as would have rendred the Encampment much more incommodious and difficult. The&s;e were &s;uch In&s;tances of marvellous Kindne&s;&s;es, as our Enemies could not but take Notice of; &s;o that we may &s;ay, <HI>Their rock is not as our Rock, even our Enemies them&s;elves being judges, Deut. 32.31.</HI></P>

Another In&s;tance of GOD'S marvellous Kindne&s;s in what concerns the late Expedition, was, <HI>That mo&s;t of the Land Army who under|took this great Enterprize, had not practical Knowlege in the Arts of War.</HI> Incamping, Intrenching, erecting Batteries, Bombarding and Cannonading, was what they had not been
<PB N="15" REF="005584_0019_102692791744E0F0">acquainted with; yet being u&s;ed to turn their Hands to many &s;orts of Work, they &s;oon un|der&s;tood what was to be done: If they had not &s;o much &s;kill as regular Forces, yet they had one prime Qualification, they engaged with Re&s;olution and good Will; they were able-bodied Men, able to endure Labour and Fatigue; they perform'd their duty as Sol|diers, and did that work which would have imployed many hundred Pioners: They were near to a Country that could &s;upply them with a &s;ufficiency of good, &s;trong and whol&s;om Food, by which they were kept in heart and high &s;pirit. That this is of great importance, we have the Opinion of the be&s;t of Judges of his time, Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> who was wont to receive &s;upplies of Soldiers from <HI>England,</HI> of whom he &s;aid, he found it be&s;t to bring them to Engage the Enemy before the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Beef was di&s;&s;olved in their Bellies; finding by Ex|perience that when they fed on cold and weak Diet, they lo&s;t much of their Vivacity and Courage. All the&s;e advantages are from Him who is the Author of all good: It was He that in&s;tructed an undi&s;ciplin'd Army, &s;o that they might &s;ay with the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 144.1 <HI>Thou ha&s;t tought my hands to War and my fingers to Fight.</HI></P>
<P N="6"><PB N="16" REF="005584_0020_1026914D30080D10">
6. Another In&s;tance of GOD'S marvellous Kindne&s;s in the late Expedition, was, <HI>The Har|mony, Unanimity and good Agreement between the Sea and Land Forces.</HI> Different Powers make different Claims: There are points not fully &s;etled in the olde&s;t and be&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed Con&s;titutions as to the extent of Prerogative and Liverty; the extent of Maritine of Ad|miralty Powers and that of Civil: But in this Undertaking again&s;t the Enemy, there was an happy Concord, no Jealou&s;ie or Emulation; the Sea and Lond Forces were ready to afford each other mutual Help and A&s;&s;i&s;tance: How happy and how u&s;eful is &s;uch Agreement? Like that of <HI>Joab</HI> and <HI>Abi&s;hal,</HI> when <HI>Joab</HI> found him&s;elf be&s;et before and behind; he made a double Front, then he makes a &s;hort military Oration, enough to warm the hearts and invigorate the minds of every one, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 10.11. <HI>And be &s;aid, if the Syrians be too &s;trong for me, then thou &s;halt help me; if the Children of Ammon be too hard for thee, then I will come and help thee: Be of good Courage, and let us play the Men for our People, and for the City of our GOD, and let the LORD do what &s;eemeth him good.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Another In&s;tance of GOD'S marvellous Kindne&s;s, is, <HI>The protection and &s;alvation of GOD in pre&s;erving our Forces from the Shot
<PB N="17" REF="005584_0021_1026938EAC878940">of the Enemy.</HI> All the Oppo&s;ition they made at the Landing of our Men was ineffectual and in&s;ignificant: Notwith&s;tanding all the advan|tage of Ground, the lo&s;s they &s;u&s;tained was greater than the damage they did. GOD in his great Mercy &s;o ordered it, that when they expected our Men to Land in one place, they Landed at another place, only becau&s;e it ap|peared a better place; which quite di&s;concerted the Mea&s;ures and defeaned the De&s;ign of the Enemy. At the time of the Siege, when the Shooters &s;hot from the Wall, it is wonderful that they did no more Execution: How &s;hall we &s;peak of it but in the Language of the P&s;al|mi&s;t? <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 5.11, 12. <HI>Let all tho&s;e that put their trust in thee rejoice; let them ever &s;hout for joy, becau&s;e thou defende&s;t them: With favour thou wilt compa&s;s them as with a &s;hield.</HI> P&s;al. 140.7 <HI>O God the LORD, the &s;trength of my &s;alvation; thou hast covered my head in the day of hattel.</HI></P>
<P N="8">Another In&s;tance of marvellous Kind|ne&s;s of GOD in this important Affair, was, <HI>The Health that he afforded to our Army and Pleet.</HI> It is no uncommon thing for Fleets and Ar|mies, e&s;pecially if they ly long Incamped, to &s;uffer more <HI>from the Pe&s;tilence that walketh in darkne&s;s, and the de&s;truction that wa&s;teth at noon-day,</HI> than from the Sword of the Enemy. This we &s;orrowfully experienc'd at <HI>Wood
<PB N="18" REF="005584_0022_102693904240A130">Creek</HI> &s;ome Years pa&s;t. What is marvellous Kindne&s;s indeed, is this, that by the Sword of the Enemy, by the Sea, and by Sickne&s;s and all Accidents, we did not loo&s;e more Lives, than out of &s;uch Number, of which the Fleet and Army did con&s;i&s;t, in &s;uch a &s;pace of Time we have lo&s;t at home when it hath not been ac|counted a very &s;ickly Time; &s;ometimes out of &s;uch a Number and in &s;uch a &s;pace of Times, it is probable that we have lo&s;t many more: So that we may &s;ay, <HI>GOD hath &s;hewed his marvellous Kindne&s;s in a &s;trong City.</HI></P>
<P>Had the Soldiers gone upon that Expedition with never &s;o much Re&s;olution and good Will, yet if they had been Sick had lo&s;t their Strength, they could not have &s;u&s;tained the Burthen and performed Labour n&egrave;ce&s;&s;ary to be done; but having Health, Strength and good Will, they went through all with Chearful|ne&s;s: For as <HI>Nehemiah</HI> &s;aid of their great Works at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> &s;uch as were the Wonder and Envy of tho&s;e round about them; he gives this Rea&s;on for the uncommon progre&s;s they made, Neh. 4.6. <HI>So built we the Wall; and all the Wall was joined together unto the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work.</HI></P>
<P>The time would fail to mention all the particular wonders of Providence, either with re&s;pect to the Expedition in general, or what occurr'd to Parties or particular Per&s;ons.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="005584_0023_1026914FA585D1D8">The <HI>French</HI> De&s;erting and Evacuating the Grand Battery, a place of great Strength, whatever induced them to it, whether a &s;car|city of Men, or a Panick that &s;ei&s;ed them; whatever was the Cau&s;e, happy were the Ef|fects, and great the was the Joy on our part.</P>
<P>The happy &s;ucce&s;s of our Crui&s;ers and Ships of War, in preventing the Enemy in the City from receiving Supplies of Food, Naval or Warlike Stores, was another marvellous Kindne&s;s conferred on us.</P>
<P>The Bombs broke &s;o near to our Men as to cover them with dirt, yet did them little harm.</P>
<P>The whole Affairs is &s;o replete with Wonders, accompanied with &s;uch a train of Providences in what was antecedent or preparatory, in the time of Action, and what hath happed &s;ince to our Advantage and to the prejudice of the E|nemy: That were not the Facts a well known Truth, the whole would appear more with the air of a Romance, than a true Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P N="9">9. Another In&s;tance of marvellous Kind|ne&s;s, was, <HI>That the full Strength of the Place was unknown to us.</HI> When the great Undertaking was &s;et on foot, it was &s;uppo&s;ed that the Place was Weak and but &s;lenderly Fortified on the Land-&s;ide; &s;o that it was thought that it might be Reduced by a Land Army: The Wall was repre&s;ented on that part as low and unfini&s;hed,
<PB N="20" REF="005584_0024_10269393C0BEF6B8">which was an Encouragement to ingage in the important Affair; and may &s;erve as a ju&s;t Vin|dication of the Project from any charge of Ra&s;h|ne&s;s: But when our Men &s;aw the full Strength of the Place, the heighth of the Walls, the depth of the Ditch, its &s;olid Foundations and great Thickne&s;s; its Furniture to Offend, and the ample Provi&s;ion made to Defend the Place, the Art and Skill with which every part was contrived and done, they were filled with won|der, like the Queen of <HI>Sheba,</HI> 1 <HI>King.</HI> 10.4. And when the Queen had &s;een all <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Wi&s;dom and the Hou&s;e he had built, there was no more &s;pirit in her; for &s;he &s;aid, <HI>Behold, the half was not told me.</HI></P>
<P>As GOD &s;ometimes confounds the Wi&s;dom of the wi&s;e; here in this Affair, GOD in his marvellous Kindne&s;s, hath turn'd our Igno|rance and Unacquaintedne&s;s with the true &s;tate of the Place to our advantage.</P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Another In&s;tance of marvellous Kindne&s;s is this, <HI>That GOD hath graciou&s;ly heard our Prayers, which have been ince&s;&s;antly put up, and done all the&s;e great Things for us, notwith&s;tanding our many repeated Provocations and Offences.</HI> When we con&s;ider our Un|thankfulne&s;s for Mercies received, our Un|fruitfulne&s;s under go&s;pel Means and Advan|tages, our Deadne&s;s and Formality, Prophane|ne&s;s,
<PB N="21" REF="005584_0025_10269396C7595CE8">Inju&s;tice, Intemperance; when Iniquity doth &s;o much abound and the Love of many waxeth cold, GOD'S Kindne&s;s is to be con&s;i|dered as &s;o much the more Marvellous.</P>
<P>At that time when GOD was working Won|ders for <HI>David,</HI> &s;ubjecting to him the &s;trong City of <HI>Rabbah, David</HI> had Offended greatly in the matter of <HI>Urich the Hittite;</HI> &s;o that when he was brought to a due &s;ight and &s;en&s;e of that great Sin; the goodne&s;s of GOD in doing &s;uch great things for him, might rai&s;e in him &s;o much the more exalted Thoughts of GOD'S marvellous Kindne&s;s in what related to the Reduction of that &s;trong City.</P>
<P>PROP. 2. <HI>That for &s;uch marvellous Kindne&s;s we ought to ble&s;s the LORD.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. We &s;hould ble&s;s the LORD in Humility. We &s;hould rejoice with trembling: For he that hath lift us up may ca&s;t us down, and turn his hand again&s;t us all the day long.

<P>We &s;hall conclude this <HI>U&s;e</HI> of Exhortation to Thank&s;giving and Prai&s;e, with only Three
<PB N="25" REF="005584_0029_102693A042D89F58"><HI>Motives,</HI> which we find all laid together, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 147.1 <HI>Prai&s;e ye the LORD, for it is good to &s;ing prai&s;es unto our GOD: for it plea&s;ant, and prai&s;e it comely. Good, Plea&s;ant</HI> and <HI>Comely.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It is Good:</HI> There is a real Goodne&s;s in it. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 92.1. <HI>It is a good thing to give thanks unto the LORD, and to &s;ing prai&s;es unto thy Name, O mo&s;t high.</HI></P>
<P>The ways of GOD'S Providence in the Expe|dition have been &s;uch and &s;o remarkable, that the Ignorant and Prophane, Carele&s;s and Irre|ligious, are obliged to own that this is the &s;ingers of GOD; and &s;hall not the Righteous ble&s;s his holy Name? If it be &s;o good to give Thanks, will good Men be ungrateful? Nay, that is a Contradiction; <HI>Unthankful and Evil</HI> go toge|ther. Shall all Nature &s;peak forth the high Prai&s;es of GOD, and &s;hall we be &s;ilent? Let our Mouths be filled with the high Prai&s;es of GOD; <HI>for it is a good thing to give Thanks unto the LORD.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Con&s;ider by way of Motive, <HI>That it is Plea&s;ant.</HI> Grief compre&s;&s;eth the heart, and therefore is an unea&s;ie thing: But Joy dilates and expands the Soul; is therefore attended with plea&s;ing Sen&s;ations. A Soul &s;en|&s;ible of his own Sin and Unworthine&s;s, and yet enjoying the Overflowings of divine Goodne&s;s, and hath his Mind proportionably drawn out in Thankfulne&s;s, enjoys Happine&s;s and hath a
<PB N="26" REF="005584_0030_102693A1D006B8E0">true ta&s;te of Plea&s;ure. Mu&s;t it not be plea|&s;ant, &s;ince &s;inging Prai&s;es to GOD in the happy Imployment and Entertainment of Angels and the &s;pirits of ju&s;t Men made perfect, and will be &s;o to all Eternity. If therefore it were not plea&s;ant, Heaven would be no Heaven, but a place of Confinement and Unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">3. To excite to Thankfulne&s;s by way of Motive, con&s;ider, <HI>That Prai&s;e is Comely.</HI> What is beauty or comeline&s;s, but a ju&s;t pro|portion and due di&s;po&s;ition of Parts? where there is no Symmetry or ju&s;t proportion of Features, there is what we call <HI>Homeline&s;s:</HI> If &s;o, then Ingratitude is not only uncomely, but even mon&s;trous. An ungrateful, unthankful Per&s;on, makes a frightful Figure; is abhorr'd by GOD and Man. Since GOD has done &s;o much for us in the great Deliverances he has wrought, we can do no le&s;s in decency and duty, than offer up to Him a tribute of Prai&s;e due to him. Let us all join together and ble&s;s his holy Name: <HI>Both young Men and Maidens, old Men and Children, let them Prai&s;e the Name of the LORD; for his Name alone is Excellent, his Glory is above the Earth and Heaven, and Prai&s;e is Comely.</HI> The mo&s;t unexceptionable Evidence of true Gratitude, and that we are Thankful for his marvellous Kindne&s;s, is, <HI>That we yield to Him &s;incere, chearful and univer&s;al Obedience.</HI></P>
