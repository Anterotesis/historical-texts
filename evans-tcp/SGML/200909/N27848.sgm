<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE following</HI> very important <HI>and</HI> intere&s;ting trial, <HI>and the law arguments on the different motions made to the court, has been long kept from the public eye; but no longer than inevitably necessary&mdash;It would have been imprudent, (if not unlawful) to have published a first trial, when a second was pending. The reporter has curtailed the second trial as much as possible&mdash;not repeat|ing, but referring to the testimony given on the first trial; but he has given at length all</HI> new <HI>evidence that occurred. The testimony is accurately reported&mdash;he believes the ar|guments and opinions to be so, and, to make it so, wherever opportunity offered, he has submitted it to the inspection of the gentlemen themselves: when he could not, he trusts</HI> unimportant inaccuracies, if any, <HI>will be pardoned.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is probable, several of the names are wrong spelled, but, without more trouble than necessity demanded, it could not well be otherwise.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A CHARGE</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>Delivered to the GRAND JURY of the UNITED STATES, for the District of Pennsylvania, in the Circuit court of the United States for said dis|trict, held in the city of Philadelphia, April 11th,</HI> 1799, <HI>by JAMES IREDELL, one of the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the UNITED STATES.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN OF THE GRAND JURY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE important duties you are now called upon to fulfil, naturally in|crea&s;e with the increa&s;ing difficulties of our country. But however great tho&s;e difficulties may be, I am per&s;uaded you will meet them with a firm and intrepid &s;tep, re&s;olved, &s;o far as you are concerned, that no di&s;honour or calamity (if any &s;hould await us) &s;hall be a&s;cribable to a weak or im|partial admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>If ever any people had rea&s;on to be thankful for a long and happy enjoy|ment of peace, liberty and &s;afety, the people of the&s;e &s;tates &s;urely have. While every other country almo&s;t has been convul&s;ed with foreign or dome&s;tic war, and &s;ome of the fine&s;t countries on the globe have been the &s;cene of every &s;pecies of vice and di&s;order, where no life was &s;afe, no property was &s;ecure, no innocence had protection, and nothing but the ba&s;e&s;t crimes gave any chance for momentary pre&s;ervation; no citizen of the United States could truly &s;ay that in his own country any oppre&s;&s;ion had been permitted with impunity, or that he had any grievance to complain of, but that he was required to obey tho&s;e laws which his own repre&s;entatives had made, and under a government which the people them&s;elves had cho&s;en. But in the mid&s;t of this envied &s;ituation, we have heard the government as gro&s;sly abu&s;ed as if it had been guilty of the vile&s;t tyranny, as if common &s;en&s;e or common virtue had fled from our country, and tho&s;e pure principles of re|publicani&s;m, which have &s;o &s;trongly characterized its councils, could only be found in the happy &s;oil of France, where the &s;acred fire is pre&s;erved by five Directors on ordinary occa&s;ions, and three on extraordinary ones&mdash;who, with the aid of a republican army, &s;ecure its purity from violation by the Legi&s;lative repre&s;entatives of the people.&mdash;The external conduct of that government is upon a par with its internal.&mdash;Liberty, like the religion of Mahomet, is propagated by the &s;word. Nations are not only compelled to be free, but to be free on the French model, and placed under French guardian&s;hip. French ar&s;enals are the repo&s;itory of their arms, French trea&s;uries of their money, the city of Paris of their curio&s;ities; and they are honoured with the con&s;tant &s;upport of French enterprizes in any other part of the world. Such is the progre&s;s of a power which began by de|clarations that it abhorred all conque&s;ts for it&s;elf, and &s;ought no other fe|licity but to emancipate the world from tyrants, and leave each nation free to cha&s;e a government of its own. Tho&s;e who take no warning by &s;uch an awful example, may have deeply to lament the con&s;equences of neglecting it.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation in which we now &s;tand with that country is peculiarly c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itical. Con&s;cious of giving no real cau&s;e of offence, but irritated with injuries, and full of re&s;entment for in&s;ults; de&s;irous of peace, if it can be pre&s;erved with honour and &s;afety, but di&s;daining a &s;ecurity equally fallaci|ous and ignominious at the expence of either; &s;till holding the rejected

Olive Branch in one hand, but a &s;word in the other&mdash;we now remain in a &s;ort of middle path between peace and war, where one fal&s;e &s;tep may lead to the mo&s;t ruinous con&s;equences, and nothing can be &s;afely relied on but uncea&s;ing vigilance, and per&s;evering firmne&s;s in what we think right, leaving the event to Heaven, which &s;eldom &s;uffers the de&s;truction of nations, without &s;ome capital fault of their own.</P>
<P>Among other mea&s;ures of defence and precaution which the exigency of the cri&s;is, and the magnitude of the danger, &s;ugge&s;ted to tho&s;e to whom the people have entru&s;ted all authority in &s;uch ca&s;es, were certain acts of the legi&s;lature of the United States, not only highly important in them&s;elves but de&s;erving of the mo&s;t particular attention, on account of the great di&s;content which has been excited again&s;t them, and e&s;pecially as &s;ome of the &s;tate legi&s;latures have publicly pronounced them to be in violation of the con&s;titution of the United States. I deem it my duty, therefore, on this occa&s;ion to &s;tate to you the nature of tho&s;e laws which have been gro&s;sly mi&s;repre&s;ented, and to deliver my deliberate opinion as a Judge, in regard to the objections ari&s;ing from the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The acts to which I refer you will readily &s;uppo&s;e to be what are com|monly called the Alien and Sedition acts. I &s;hall &s;peak of each &s;eparate|ly, &s;o far as no common circum&s;tances belonging to them may make a joint di&s;cu&s;&s;ion proper.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Alien Laws,</HI> there being two.</P>
<P>To the&s;e laws, in particular, it has been objected.</P>
<P N="1">1. That an Alien ought not to be removed on &s;u&s;picion, but on proof of &s;ome crime.</P>
<P N="2">2. That an Alien coming into the country, on the faith of an act &s;ti|pulating that in a certain time, and on certain conditions, he may become a citizen, to remove him in an arbitrary manner before that time, would be a breach of public faith.</P>
<P N="3">3. That it is incon&s;i&s;tent with the following clau&s;e in the con&s;titution, (Art. I. &s;ect. 9.)</P>
<P>"The migration or importation of &s;uch per&s;ons as any of the &s;tates now exi&s;ting &s;hall think proper to admit, &s;hall not be prohibited by the Congre&s;s prior to the year one thou&s;and eight hundred and eight? but a tax or duty may be impo&s;ed on &s;uch importation, not exceeding ten dol|lars for each per&s;on." With regard to the fir&s;t objection, viz. "That an alien ought not to be removed on &s;u&s;picion, but on proof of &s;ome crime." It is believed that it never was &s;ugge&s;ted in any other country, that <HI>aliens</HI> had a right to go into a foreign country, and &s;tay at their will and plea|&s;ure without any leave from the government. The law of nations, un|doubtely is, that when an alien goes into a foreign country, he goes under either an expre&s;s or implied &s;afe conduct. In mo&s;t countries in Europe, I believe, an expre&s;s pa&s;&s;port is nece&s;&s;ary for &s;trangers. Where greater liberality is ob&s;erved, yet it is always under&s;tood that the government may order away any alien who&s;e &s;tay is deemed incompatible with the &s;afety of the country. Nothing is more common than to order away, on the eve of a war, all aliens or &s;ubjects of the nation with whom the war is to take place. Why is that done, but that it is deemed un&s;afe to re|tain in the country, men whole prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions are naturally &s;o &s;trong in favour of the enemy, that it may be apprehended they will either join in arms, or do mi&s;chief by intrigue, in his favour? How many &s;uch in&s;tances
<PB N="3" REF="037104_0007_100D7DDEAB405788">
took place it the beginning of the war with Great Britain, no body then objecting to the authority of the mea&s;ure, and the expediency of it being alone in contemplation! In ca&s;es like this, it is ridiculous to talk of a crime, becau&s;e perhaps the only crime, that a man can then be charged with, is his being born in another country, and having a &s;trong attachment to it. He is not puni&s;hed for a crime that he has committed, but depriv|ed of the power of committing one hereafter to which even a &s;en&s;e of pa|trioti&s;m may tempt a warm and mi&s;guided mind. Nobody who has ever heard of Major And<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es any liberality of mind, but mu&s;t be|lieve that he did what he thought right at the time, though in ray opini|on it was a conduct in no manner ju&s;tifiable. Yet how fatal might his &s;ucce&s;s have proved! If men, therefore, of good characters, and held in uni|ver&s;al e&s;timation for integrity, can be tempted when a great object is in view, to violate the &s;trict duties of morality, what may be expected from others who have neither character nor virtue, but &s;tand ready to yield to temptations of any kind? The opportunities during a war of making u&s;e of men of &s;uch a de&s;cription are &s;o numerous and &s;o dangerous, that no prudent nation would ever tru&s;t to the po&s;&s;ible good behaviour of many of them. Indeed mo&s;t of tho&s;e who oppo&s;e this law &s;eem to admit that as to <HI>alien enemies</HI> the interpo&s;ition may be proper but they contend it is improper before a war actually takes place to exerci&s;e &s;uch an authority, and that as to <HI>neutral aliens</HI> it is totally inadmi&s;&s;ible. To be &s;ure the two latter in&s;tances are not quite to plain, the objection I am con&s;idering be|longs equally to them all; for if an alien cannot be removed but on con|viction of a crime, then an alien enemy ought not to be removed but on conviction of trea&s;on, or &s;ome other crime &s;hewing the nece&s;&s;ity of it. If, however, we are not blind to what is evident to all the re&s;t of the world, equal danger may be apprehended from the citizens of a ho&s;tile power, be|fore war is actually declared as after, perhaps more, becau&s;e le&s;s &s;u&s;picion is entertained; and &s;ome citizens of a neutral power are equally dangerous with the others. What has given France po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Netherlands, Geneva, Switzerland and almo&s;t all Italy, and enables her to domineer over &s;o many other countries, lately powerful and completely independent, but that her arts have preceded her arms, the &s;mooth words of amity, peace, an univer&s;al love, by &s;educing weak minds, have led to an unbound|ed confidence, which has ended in their de&s;truction, and they have now to deplore the infatuation which led them to court a fraternal embrace from a bo&s;om in which a dagger was concealed.</P>
<P>In how many countries, alien friends as to us, dependent upon them, are there warm parti&s;ans not nominally French citizens but compleatly illumina|ted with French principles, electrified with French enthu&s;ia&s;m, and ready for any &s;ort of revolutionary mi&s;chief! Are we to be guarded again&s;t the former and expo&s;ed to the latter? No, gentlemen, If with &s;uch examples before their eyes, congre&s;s had either confined their precaution to a war in form, or to citi|zens of France only, lo&s;ing all &s;en&s;e of danger to their country in a regard to no|minal di&s;tinctions, they would probably ju&s;tly have de&s;erved the charge of neglecting their country's &s;afety in one of its mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential points, and hereafter the very men who are now clamorous again&s;t them for exerci&s;ing a judicious fore&s;ight, might too late have had rea&s;on to charge them, (as many former infatuated governments in Europe may now fairly be charged by their mi&s;erable deluded fellow citizens) as the authors of their country's
<PB N="4" REF="037104_0008_100D7DE257EAF878">
ruin. But tho&s;e who object to this law &s;eem to pay little regard to con|&s;iderations of this kind, and to entertain no other fear but that the Pre&s;i|dent may exerci&s;e this authority for the mere purpo&s;e of abu&s;ing it. There is no end to arguments or &s;u&s;picions of this kind. If this power is proper it mu&s;t be exerci&s;ed by &s;omebody. If from the nature of it is could be exerci&s;ed by &s;o numerous a body as Congre&s;s, yet as Congre&s;s are not con&s;tantly &s;itting, it ought not to be exerci&s;ed by them alone. If they are not to exerci&s;e it, who &s;o &s;it as the Pre&s;ident? What intere&s;t can he have in abu&s;ing &s;uch an authority? But on this occa&s;ion, as on others of the like kind, gentlemen think it &s;ufficient to &s;hew, not that a power is likely to be abu&s;ed (which is all that can be prudently guarded again&s;t), but that it po&s;&s;ibly may, and therefore to guard again&s;t the po&s;&s;ibility of an abu&s;e of power, the power is not at all to be exerci&s;ed.</P>
<P>The argument would be ju&s;t as good again&s;t his acknowledged powers, as any others, that the legi&s;lature may occa&s;ionally confide to him. Sup|po&s;e he &s;hould refu&s;e to nominate to any office? or to command the army or navy? or &s;hould a&s;&s;ign frivolous rea&s;ons again&s;t every law, &s;o that no law could be pa&s;&s;ed but with the concurrence of two thirds of both hou&s;es! Suppo&s;e Congre&s;s &s;hould rai&s;e an army without nece&s;&s;ity, lay taxes where there was no occa&s;ion for money, declare war from mere caprice, lay wanton and oppre&s;&s;ive re&s;traints on commerce, or in a time of imminent danger trifle with the &s;afety of their country, to gain a momentary breath of populari|ty at the hazard of their country's ruin! All this they may do. Does a|ny man of candour, who does not believe every thing they do wrong, ap|prehend that any of the&s;e things will be done? They have the power to do them becau&s;e the authority to pa&s;s very important and nece&s;&s;ary acts of legi&s;lation on all tho&s;e &s;ubjects, and in regard to which di&s;cretion mu&s;t be le&s;t, unavoidably implies that as it may be exerci&s;ed in a right manner, it may, if no principle prevent it, be exerci&s;ed in a wrong one. If the &s;tate legi&s;latures &s;hould combine to choo&s;e no more &s;enators, they may aboli&s;h the con&s;titution without the danger of committing rea&s;on. If to prevent a Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives being in exi&s;tence, they &s;hould keep no law in being for a &s;imilar branch of their own, deeming the abolition of the government of the United States cheaply purcha&s;ed by &s;uch a &s;acrifice, they may do this. They have the &s;ame power over the election of a Pre&s;ident and vice Pre&s;ident. What is the &s;ecurity again&s;t abu&s;e in any of the&s;e ca&s;es? None, but the precautions taken to procure a proper choice, which, if well exerci&s;ed, will at lea&s;t &s;ecure the public again&s;t a wanton abu&s;e of power, though nothing can &s;ecure them ab&s;olutely again&s;t the common frailty of men, or the po&s;&s;ibility of bad men, if accidentally inverted with power, carrying it into a dangerous extreme. We mu&s;t tru&s;t &s;ome per&s;ons, and as well as we can &s;ubmit to any collateral evil which may ari&s;e from a provi&s;ion for a great and indi&s;pen&s;able good that can only be obtained through the medium of human imperfection. At the &s;ame time it may be ob&s;erved, that in the ca&s;e of the Pre&s;ident or any executive or judicial officer wantonly abu&s;ing his tru&s;t, he is liable to impeachment, and there are frequent opportunities of changing the members of the legi&s;lature, if their conduct is not acceptable to their con&s;tituents.</P>
<P>The clau&s;e in the con&s;titution, declaring that the trial of all crimes, ex|cept by impeachment, &s;hall be by jury, can never in rea&s;on be extended to amount to a permi&s;&s;ion of perpetual re&s;idence of all &s;orts of foreigners,
<PB N="5" REF="037104_0009_100D7DE3DDF15050">
unle&s;s convicted of &s;ome crime, but is evidently calculated for the &s;ecurity of any citizen, a party to the in&s;trument or even of a foreigner if re&s;ident in the country, who when charged with the commi&s;&s;ion of a crime again&s;t the municipal laws for which he if liable to puni&s;hment, can be tried for it in no other manner.</P>
<P>The &s;econd objection it, "That an alien coming into the country, on the faith of an act &s;tipulating that in a certain time and on certain con|ditions he nay become a citizen, to remove him in an arbitrary manner before that time would be a breach of public faith."</P>
<P>With regard to this, it may be ob&s;erved, that undoubtedly the faith of government ought under all circum&s;tances, and in all po&s;&s;ible &s;ituations, to be pre&s;erved &s;acred. If therefore, in virtue of this law, all aliens from any part of the world had a right to come here, &s;tay the probationary time, and become citizens, the act in que&s;tion could not be ju&s;tified, unle&s;s it could be &s;hewn that a real (not a pretended) over-ruling public nece&s;&s;ity to which all inchoate acts of legi&s;lation mu&s;t forever be &s;ubject, occa&s;ion|ed a partial repeal of it. But there are certain conditions, without which no alien can ever be admitted, if he &s;tay ever &s;o long; and one is, that during a limited time (two years in the ca&s;e of aliens then re&s;ident; five in the ca&s;e of aliens arriving after) he has behaved at a man of a good moral character, attached to the principles of the con&s;titution of the United States, and well di&s;po&s;ed to the good order and happine&s;s of the &s;ame. If his conduct be different, he is no object of the naturalization law at all, and con&s;equently no implied compact was made with him. If his conduct be conformable to that de&s;cription, he is no object of the alien law to which the objection is applied, becau&s;e he is not a per&s;on whom the Pre&s;ident is empowered to remove, for &s;uch a per&s;on could not be deemed dangerous to the peace and &s;afety of the United States, nor could there be rea&s;onable grounds to &s;u&s;pect &s;uch a man of being concerned in any trea&s;onable or &s;ecret machinations again&s;t the government, in which ca&s;es alone the removal of any alien friend is authori&s;ed. Be&s;ides any alien coming to this country mu&s;t, or ought to know, that this being an Independent nation, it has all the rights concerning the removal of aliens which belong by the law of nations to any other; that while he remains in the country in the character of an alien, he can claim no other privi|lege than &s;uch as an alien is entitled to; and con&s;equently, whatever ri&s;que he may incur in that capacity, is incurred voluntarily, with the hope that in due time by his unexceptionable conduct, he may become a citizen of the United States. At there is no end to the inge|nuity of man, it has bees &s;ugge&s;ted that &s;uch a per&s;on, if not a citizen, is a denizen, and therefore cannot be removed as an alien. A denizen in tho&s;e laws from which we derive our own, means a per&s;on who has receiv|ed letters of denization from the king, and under the royal government &s;uch a power might undoubtedly have been exerci&s;ed. This power of de|nization is a kind of partial naturalization, giving &s;ome, but not all the privileges of a natural born &s;ubject. He may take lands by purcha&s;e or devi&s;e, but cannot inherit.</P>
<P>The i&s;&s;ue of a denizen born <HI>before</HI> denization cannot inherit; but if born <HI>after</HI> may, the ance&s;tor having been able to communicate to him in|heritable blood. But this power of the crown was thought &s;o formidable that it is expre&s;sly provided by act of parliament, that no denizen can be
<PB N="6" REF="037104_0010_100D7DE56863DFD0">
a member of the Privy Council, or of either Hou&s;e of Parliament, or have any office of tru&s;t civil or military, or be capable of any grant of lands from the crown. Upon the di&s;&s;olution of the royal government, the whole authority of naturalization, either whole or partial, belonged to the &s;everal &s;tates, and this power the people of the &s;tates have &s;ince devolved on the Congre&s;s of the United States. Denization therefore (in the &s;en&s;e here u&s;ed) is a term unknown in our law, &s;ince the right was not derived from any general legi&s;lative authority, but from a &s;pecial prerogative of the crown, to which parliamentary re&s;trictions afterwards were applied. So much &s;o, that if an act of Parliament had pa&s;&s;ed, giving certain rights to an alien with re&s;triction; exactly &s;imilar to tho&s;e of a denizen. I imagine he would not have been called a denizen; becau&s;e the royal authority was not the &s;ource from which his rights were derived. As to acts of natu|ralization them&s;elves, they are liable in England, by an expre&s;s law to certain limitations, one of which is, that the per&s;on naturalized is incapa|ble of being a member of the privy council, or either hou&s;e of parliament, or of holding offices or grants from the crown. Yet I never heard, nor do I believe that &s;uch a per&s;on was ever called a denizen; for which, as there is no foundation in precedent, or in the con&s;titution of the United States, I pre&s;ume it is a di&s;tinction without &s;olidity. Fixed principles of law cannot be grounded on the airy imagination of man.</P>
<P>The third objection is, "That it is incon&s;i&s;tent with the following clau&s;e in the con&s;titution, viz.</P>
<P>"The migration or importation of &s;uch per&s;ons as any of the &s;tates now exi&s;ting &s;hall think proper to admit, &s;hall not be prohibited by the con|gre&s;s prior to the year one thou&s;and eight hundred and eight, but a tax or duty may be impo&s;ed on &s;aid importation not exceeding ten dollars for etch per&s;on."</P>
<P>I am not &s;atisfied, as to this objection, that it is &s;ufficient to over-rule it, to &s;ay the words do not expre&s;s the real meaning, either of tho&s;e who formed the con&s;titution, or tho&s;e who e&s;tabli&s;hed it, although I do verily believe in my own mind, that the article was intended only for &s;laves, and the clau&s;e was expre&s;&s;ed in its pre&s;ent manner to accommodate different gentlemen, &s;ome of whom could not bare the name <HI>slaves,</HI> and others had objections to it. But though this probably is the real truth, yet, if in attempting to compromi&s;e, they have unguardedly u&s;ed expre&s;&s;ions that go beyond their meaning, and there is nothing but private hi&s;tory to elu|cidate it, I &s;hall deem it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to confine my&s;elf to the written in&s;trument. Other rea&s;ons may make the point doubtful, but at pre&s;ent I am inclined to think it mu&s;t be admitted; that congre&s;s prior to the year 1808, cannot prohibit the migration of free per&s;ons to a particu|lar &s;tate, exi&s;ting at the time of the con&s;titution, which &s;uch &s;tate &s;hall, by law, agree to receive. The &s;tates then exi&s;ting, therefore, till 1808 may (we will &s;ay) admit the migration of per&s;ons to their own &s;tates, without any prohibitory act of congre&s;s.&mdash;This they may do upon prin|ciples of general policy, and in con&s;i&s;tence with all their other duties. The &s;tates are expre&s;sly prohibited from entering into an engagement or contract with another &s;tate, or engaging in war, unle&s;s actually invaded, or in &s;uch imminent danger, as will not admit of delay. The avenues to foreign connection being thus carefully clo&s;ed, it will &s;carcely be con|tended, that in ca&s;e of war, a &s;tate could, either directly or indirectly,
<PB N="7" REF="037104_0011_100D7DE731917400">
permit the migration of enemies. If they did, the United States could certainly without any impeachment of the general right of allowing mi|gration, in virtue of their authority to repel inva&s;ion, prevent the arrival of &s;uch. And as &s;uch inva&s;ion may be attempted without a formal war, and Congre&s;s have an expre&s;s right to protect again&s;t inva&s;ion, as well as to repel it, I pre&s;ume Congre&s;s would al&s;o have authority to prevent the arrival of any enemies, coming in the di&s;gui&s;e of friends, to invade their country. But, admitting the right to permit migration in its full force, the per&s;ons migrating on their authority mu&s;t be &s;ubject to the laws of the country, which con&s;i&s;t not only of tho&s;e of the particular &s;tate, but of the United States. While aliens, therefore, they mu&s;t remain in the cha|racter of aliens; and, of cour&s;e, upon the principles I have mentioned, be &s;ubject to a power of removal, in certain ca&s;es recognized in the law of nations; nor can they cea&s;e to be in this &s;ituation, until they become citizens of the United States; in which ca&s;e they mu&s;t obey the laws of the union as well as of the particular &s;tate they re&s;ide in. But, gentle|men argue as if becau&s;e the &s;tates had a right to permit migration the migrants were under a &s;ort of &s;pecial protection of the &s;tate admitting it, left the United States, merely to di&s;appoint the purpo&s;e of migration, &s;hould exerci&s;e an arbitrary authority of removal without any cau&s;e at all. It would be ju&s;t as con&s;i&s;tent to &s;ay, that if &s;uch migrant was charged with a murder on the high &s;eas, or in any fort or ar&s;enal of the United States, he &s;hould not be tried for it in a court of the United States, left the court and juries, out of ill will to the &s;tate; &s;hould combine to procure his conviction and puni&s;hment, in all events, to defeat the &s;tate law. The two powers may undoubtedly be made compatible, if the legi&s;latures of the particular &s;tates, and the government of the United States do their duty; without which pre&s;umption, not an authority given by the con&s;titution can exi&s;t. They &s;urely are more compatible than the collateral powers of taxation, which, under each government, go to an unlimited extent, but the very nature of which forbids any other limitation than a &s;en&s;e of mo|ral right and ju&s;tice. If we &s;cepticize in the manner of &s;ome gentlemen on this &s;ubject, &s;uppo&s;e each legi&s;lature &s;hould tax to the amount of 19<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the pound; each has the power; but is &s;uch an exerci&s;e of it more apprehended than we apprehend an earthquake to &s;wallow us all up at this very moment? All &s;y&s;tems of government, &s;uppo&s;e they are to be admi|ni&s;tered by men of common &s;en&s;e and common hone&s;ty. In our Country, as all ultimately depends on the voice of the people, they have it in their power, and it is to be pre&s;umed they generally will chu&s;e men of this de&s;|cription: but if they will not, the ca&s;e to be &s;ure is without remedy. If they chu&s;e fools, they will have fooli&s;h laws. If they chu&s;e knaves they will have knavi&s;h ones. But this can never be the ca&s;e until they are generally fools or knaves them&s;elves, which, thank God, is not likely ever to become the character of the American people.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid what I thought material as to the alien laws, upon the particular objections to them, I now proceed to di&s;cu&s;s the objections which have been made to what is called the &s;edition act, one of which equally applies to the alien laws as well as to this. But I think it proper previou&s;ly to read the law it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The objections (&s;o far as I have heard them) to this act are as follow:</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="8" REF="037104_0012_100D7DE90E3786C0">
1. (And this applies to the alien law al&s;o) That there is no &s;pecific power given to pa&s;s an act of this de&s;cription, though in the particular &s;pecific powers given there is authority conveyed as to other offences &s;pe|cially named.</P>
<P N="2">2. That this law is not warranted by a clau&s;e in the con&s;titution, con|veying legi&s;lative authority, which after de&s;ignating particular objects, adds:</P>
<P>"And to make all laws which &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary and proper for carry|ing into execution the foregoing powers, and all other power ve&s;ted by this con&s;titution in the government of the United States, or in any de|partment or officer thereof."&mdash;Becau&s;e it is not nece&s;&s;ary and proper to pa&s;s any &s;uch law in order to carry into execution any of tho&s;e powers.</P>
<P N="3">3. That admitting the former po&s;itions are not maintainable, yet the exerci&s;e of this authority is compatible with the following amendment to the con&s;titution, viz.</P>
<P>"Congre&s;s &s;hall make no law re&s;pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ting an e&s;tabli&s;hment of religion, or prohibiting the full exerci&s;e thereof; or abridging the freedom of &s;peech, or of the pre&s;s, or the right of the people peaceably to a&s;&s;emble, and to petition the government for a redre&s;s of grievances."</P>
<P>With regard to the fir&s;t objection, I readily acknowledge, that &s;oon after the con&s;titution was propo&s;ed, and when I had taken a much more &s;uperficial view of it than I was &s;en&s;ible of at the time, I did think Congre&s;s could not provide for the puni&s;hment of any crimes but &s;uch as are &s;pecifically de&s;ignated in the particular powers enumerated. I deli|vered that opinion in the convention at North-Carolina, in the year 1788, with a perfect conviction, at the time, that it was well founded. But I have &s;ince been convinced it was an erroneous opinion, and my rea&s;ons for changing it I &s;hall &s;tate to you as clearly is I am able.</P>
<P>It is in vain to make any law unle&s;s &s;ome &s;anction be annexed to it, to prevent or puni&s;h its violation. A law without it might be equivalent to a good moral &s;ermon, but bad members of &s;ociety would be as little in|fluenced by one as the other. It is, therefore, nece&s;&s;ary and proper, for in&s;tance, under the con&s;titution of the United States, to &s;ecure the effect of all laws which impo&s;e a duty on &s;ome particular per&s;ons, by providing &s;ome penalty or puni&s;hment if they di&s;obey. The authority to provide &s;uch is conveyed by the following general words in the con&s;titution, at the end of the objects of legi&s;lation particularly &s;pecified: "To make all laws which &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers ve&s;ted by this con&s;titution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof." A penalty alone would not in every ca&s;e be &s;ufficient, for the offender might be rich and di&s;regard it, or poor, though a wilful offender, and unable to pay it. A fine, therefore, will not always an&s;wer the purpo&s;e, but impri&s;onment mu&s;t be in many ca&s;es added, though a wi&s;e and humane legi&s;lature will always di&s;pen&s;e with this, where the importance of the ca&s;e does not require it. But if it does, from the very nature of the pu|ni&s;hment, it becomes a <HI>criminal,</HI> and not a <HI>civil</HI> offence; the grand jury mu&s;t indict, before the offender can be convicted.</P>
<P>This general po&s;ition may be illu&s;trated by a variety of in&s;tances under the penal code of the United States, which have, I believe, never been objected to as uncon&s;titutional, though there have never been wanting
<PB N="9" REF="037104_0013_100D7DEC9B3AB018">
penetrating and di&s;cerning members who were ready enough to take ex|ceptions where they found any plau&s;ible ground for them. I &s;hall enume|rate a few.</P>
<P>In the act entitled, an act for the puni&s;hment of certain crimes again&s;t the United States (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ol.1 Swift's edition, p. 100) among other crimes &s;pecified, are the following.</P>
<P>Murder or larceny in a fort belonging to the United States. Mi&s;pri&s;i|on of felony committed in any place und<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;ole and exclu&s;ive juri&s;dic|tion of the United States. Stealing or fal&s;ifying a record of any court of the United States. Perjury in any court of the United States. Bribing a judge of the United States. Ob&s;tructing the execution of any kind of proce&s;s i&s;&s;uing from a court of the United States.</P>
<P>In the collection act, 1 vol. p. 237, it is provided, that in all ca&s;es where an oath is by that act required from a ma&s;ter or other per&s;on having command of a &s;hip or ve&s;&s;el, or from an owner o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a&s;&s;ignee of goods, wares, and merchandize, his or her factor or agent, if the per&s;on &s;o &s;wearing &s;hall &s;wear fal&s;ely, &s;uch per&s;on &s;hall, on indictment and conviction there|of, be puni&s;hed by fine or impri&s;onment, or both, in the di&s;cretion of the court, before whom &s;uch conviction &s;hall be had, &s;o as the fine &s;hall not exceed one thou&s;and dollars, and the term of impri&s;onment &s;hall not ex|ceed twelve months.</P>
<P>In the act laying duties on di&s;tilled &s;pirits, (vol. i. p. 324) in the 39th &s;ection it is provided as follows:</P>
<P>"If any &s;upervi&s;or, or other officer of in&s;pection, in any criminal pro|&s;ecution again&s;t them, &s;hall be convicted of oppre&s;&s;ion or extortion in the execution of his office, he &s;hall be fined not exceeding five hundred dollars, or i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ri&s;oned not exceeding &s;ix months, or both, at the di&s;cretion of the court; and &s;hall al&s;o forfeit his office."</P>
<P>The&s;e in&s;tances de&s;erve great con&s;ideration; becau&s;e I believe no can|did man will deny that the&s;e provi&s;ions were con&s;titutional exerci&s;es of authority, within the &s;cope of the general authority conveyed, though not &s;pecially named as objects which it &s;hould be competent for Congre&s;s to provide for. And they certainly derive weight from the con&s;ideration, that the principle of them (which I believe was the ca&s;e) was never ob|jected to, thou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the expediency of &s;ome of the provi&s;ions may have been.</P>
<P>In further illu&s;tration of this &s;ubject, I &s;hall &s;tate a ca&s;e which was determined in this court&mdash;The United States again&s;t Worrell, publi&s;hed in M.. Dallas's reports, p. 384. Where there was an indictment again&s;t the defendant for attempting to bribe Mr. Coxe, the Commi&s;&s;ioner of the Revenue. The defendant was found guilty, and afterwards a motion was made in arre&s;ting judgment, a&s;&s;igning, together with &s;ome technical ob|jections, this general one, that the Court had no cognizance of the offence, becau&s;e no act of Congre&s;s had pa&s;&s;ed creating the offence and pre&s;crib|ing the puni&s;hment, but it was &s;olely on the foot of the common law. The very able and ingenious gentleman who is the reporter of that ca&s;e, and was the defendant's Council in it, in the cour&s;e of his argument, makes the following ob&s;ervations, part of which are remarkably &s;triking and pertinent to my pre&s;ent &s;ubject: <Q>In relation to crimes and puni&s;h|ments, the objects of the delegated power of the United States are enu|merated and fixed. Congre&s;s may provide for the puni&s;hment of coun|terfeiting the &s;ecurities and current coin of the United States; and,
<PB N="10" REF="037104_0014_100D7DEF2061FA60">
may define and puni&s;h piracies and felonies committed on the high &s;eas, and offences again&s;t the law of nations. Art. i. 8. And &s;o, likewi&s;e, <HI>Congress may make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for car|rying into execution, the powers of the General Government.</HI> But here is no reference to a common law authority: Every power is matter of definite and po&s;itive grant; and the very powers that are granted cannot take effect until they are exerci&s;ed through the medium of a law. Congre&s;s had undoubtedly a power to make a law, which &s;hould render it criminal to offer a bribe to the commi&s;&s;ioner of the Revenue; but not having made the law, the crime is not recognized by the Federal code, Con&s;titutional or Legi&s;lative; and con&s;equently, it is not a &s;ub|ject on which the Judicial authority of the Union can operate.</Q> So far the ob&s;ervations of the defendant's Coun&s;el Judge Cha&s;e, who on that occa&s;ion differed from Judge Peters, as to the common law juri&s;diction of the Court, held, that under the 8th &s;ection of the fir&s;t article, which I am now con&s;idering, although bribery is not among the crimes and of|fences &s;pecially mentioned, it is certainly included in that general provi|&s;ion; and Congre&s;s might have pa&s;&s;ed a law on the &s;ubject which would have given the Court cognizance of the offence. Judge Peters was of opinion, that the defendant was puni&s;hable at common law; but that it was competent for Congre&s;s to pa&s;s a Legi&s;lative act on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I conclude, therefore, that the fir&s;t objection is not maintainable.</P>
<P>With regard to the &s;econd objection, which is, that this law is not war|ranted by that clau&s;e in the con&s;titution authori&s;ing Congre&s;s to pa&s;s all laws which &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary and proper, for carrying into execution, the powers &s;pecially enumerated, and all other powers ve&s;ted, by the con&s;titu|tion, in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof: becau&s;e, it is not nece&s;&s;ary and proper to pa&s;s any &s;uch law, in order to carry into execution any of tho&s;e powers&mdash;it is to be ob|&s;erved, that, from the very nature of the power, it is, and mu&s;t be, di&s;cre|tionary.&mdash;What is nece&s;&s;ary and proper, in regard to any particular &s;ub|ject, cannot, before an occa&s;ion ari&s;es, be logically defined; but mu&s;t de|pend upon various exten&s;ive views of a ca&s;e, which no human fore&s;ight can reach. What is nece&s;&s;ary and proper in a time of confu&s;ion and ge|neral di&s;order, would not, perhaps, be nece&s;&s;ary and proper in a time of tranquillity and order. The&s;e are con&s;derations of policy, not que&s;tions of law, and upon which the legi&s;lature is bound to decide according to its real opinion of the nece&s;&s;ity and propriety of any act particularly in con|templation. It is, however, alledged, that the nece&s;&s;ity and propriety of pa&s;&s;ing collateral laws for the &s;upport of others, is confined to ca&s;es where the powers are delegated, and does not extend to ca&s;es which have a reference to general danger only. The words are general, <Q>for carry|ing into execution the &s;pecial powers previou&s;ly enumerated, and all other powers ve&s;ted by the con&s;titution in the government of the Uni|ted States, or any department or officer thereof.</Q> If, therefore, there be any thing nece&s;&s;ary and proper for carrying into execution any or all of tho&s;e powers, I pre&s;ume, that may be con&s;titutionally enacted. Two ob|jects are aimed at by every rational government, more e&s;pecially by free ones; 1. That the people may under&s;tand the laws, and voluntarily obey them. 2. That if this be not done by any individual, he &s;hall be com|pelled to obey them, or puni&s;hed for di&s;obedience. The fir&s;t object is,

undoubtedly the mo&s;t momentous; for, as the legitimate object of every government is the happine&s;s of the people committed to its care, nothing can tend more to promote this than that, by a voluntary obedience to the laws of the country, they &s;hould render puni&s;hments unnece&s;&s;ary.

In con&s;equence of &s;uch mi&s;repre&s;entations, a ci|vil war had nearly de&s;olated our country, and a certain expence of near two millions of dollars was actually incurred, which might be deemed the price of libels, and among other cau&s;es made nece&s;&s;ary a judicious and mo|derate land tax, which no man de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, to be con&s;titutional, but is now made the pretext of au<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">thor in&s;urrection.

A pen, in the hands of an able and virtu|ous man, may enlighten a whole nation, and, by ob&s;ervations of real wi&s;|dom, grounded on pure morality, may lead it to the path of honour and happine&s;s.&mdash;The &s;ome pen in the hands of a man equally able, but with vices as great as the other's virtues, may, by arts of &s;ophi&s;try ea&s;ily at|tainable, and inflaming the pa&s;&s;ions of weak minds, delude many into opinions the mo&s;t dangerous, and conduct them to actions the mo&s;t crimi|nal. Men who are at a di&s;tance from the &s;ource of information mu&s;t rely almo&s;t altogether on the accounts they receive from others. If their ac|counts are founded in truth, their heads or hearts mu&s;t be to blame, if they think or act wrongly. But, if their account<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> are fal&s;e, the be&s;t head and the be&s;t heart cannot be proof again&s;t their influence; nor is it po&s;|&s;ible to calculate the combined effect of innumerable artifices, either by direct fal&s;ehood, or invidious in&s;inuations, told day by day, upon minds both able and virtuous. Such being unque&s;tionably the ca&s;e, can it be to|lerated in any civilized &s;ociety that any &s;hould be permitted with impunity to tell fal&s;ehoods to the people, with an expre&s;s intention to deceive them, and lead them into di&s;content, if not into in&s;urrection, which is &s;o apt to follow? It is believed no government in the world ever was without &s;uch a power. It is, unque&s;tionably po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by all the &s;tate governments, and probably has been exerci&s;ed in all of them: Sure I am, it has in &s;ome. If nece&s;&s;ary and proper for them, why not equally &s;o, at lea&s;t, for the go|vernment of the United States, naturally an object of more jealou&s;y and alarm, becau&s;e it has greater concerns to provide for?

the &s;ame principle, as being the fir&s;t &s;tep to the mi&s;chief intended to be prevented; and if &s;uch fal&s;ehoods, with regard to one particular law, are dangerous, and therefore ought not to be permitted without puni&s;hment&mdash;Why &s;hould &s;uch which are intended to de&s;troy confidence in government altogether, and, thus, induce di&s;obedience to every act of it?

<P>I have only to add, under this head, that in order to obviate any proba|ble ill u&s;e of this large and di&s;cretionary power, the con&s;titution and cer|tain amendments to it, have prohibited in expre&s;s words the exerci&s;e of &s;ome particular authorities which otherwi&s;e might be &s;uppo&s;ed to be com|prehended within them.

<P N="4">4. That objection is, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">at the act is in violation of this amendment of the con&s;titution. (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d vol. Swift's Edition, p, 455. Article 3d.)</P>
<P><Q>Congre&s;s &s;hall make no law re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing an e&s;tabli&s;hment of religion, or prohibiting the free exerci&s;e thereof; or abridging the freedom of &s;peech, or of the pre&s;s, or the right of the people peaceably to a&s;&s;emble, and to petition the government for a redre&s;s of grievances.</Q></P>
<P>The que&s;tion then is,</P>
<P>Whether this law has abridged the freedom of the pre&s;s?</P>
<P>Here is a remarkable difference in expre&s;&s;ions as to the different ob|jects in the &s;ame clau&s;e. They are to make no law <HI>respecting</HI> an e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of religion, or prohibiting the free exerci&s;e thereof: or <HI>abridg|ing</HI> the freedom of &s;peech, or of the pre&s;s. When as to one object they entirely prohibit any act whatever, and as to another object only limit the exerci&s;e of the power, they mu&s;t in rea&s;on be &s;uppo&s;ed to mean diffe|rent things. I pre&s;ume, therefore, that Congre&s;s may make a law <HI>re|specting</HI> the pre&s;s, provided the law be &s;uch as not to <HI>abridge its freedom.</HI> What might be deemed the freedom of the pre&s;s, if it had been a new &s;ubject, and never before in di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, might indeed admit of &s;ome con|trover&s;y.&mdash;But &s;o far as precedent habit, laws and practices are concerned, there can &s;carcely be a more definite meaning than that which all the&s;e have affixed to the term in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>We derive our principles of law originally from England. There the pre&s;s, I believe, is as free as in any country of the world, and &s;o it has been for near a century. The definition of it is, in my opinion, no where more happily or ju&s;tly expre&s;&s;ed than by the great Author of the Com|mentaries on the Laws of England, which book de&s;erves more particular regard on this occa&s;ion, becau&s;e for near 30 years it has been the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al of almo&s;t every &s;tudent of law in the United States, and its uncommon excellence has al&s;o introduced it into the libraries, and often to the favour|ite reading of private gentlemen; &s;o that his views of the &s;ubject could &s;carcely be unknown to tho&s;e who framed the Amendments to the con&s;ti|tution, and if they were not, unle&s;s his explanation had been &s;atisfactory, I pre&s;ume the Amendment would have been more particularly worded, to guard again&s;t any po&s;&s;ible mi&s;take. His explanation is as follows:</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="037104_0017_100D7DF571D969E0">
<Q>The Liberty of the Pre&s;s is indeed e&s;&s;ential to the nature of a free &s;tate. And this con&s;i&s;ts in laying no <HI>previous</HI> re&s;traints upon publicati|ons, and not in freedom from cen&s;ure for criminal matter when publi&s;h|ed. Every freeman has an undoubted right to lay what &s;entiments <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e plea&s;es before the public; to forbid this, is to de&s;troy the freedom of the pre&s;s: but it he publi&s;hes what is improper, mi&s;chievous, or illegal he mu&s;t take the con&s;equence of his own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. To &s;ubject the pre&s;s to the re&s;trictive power of a Licen&s;er, as was formerly done, both before and &s;ince the revolution, is to &s;ubject all freedom of &s;entiment to the prejudices of one man, and make him the arbitrary and infallible judge of all controver&s;ial points in learning, religion, and government. But to puni&s;h (as the law does at pre&s;ent) any dangerous or offen&s;ive writ|ings, which, when publi&s;hed, &s;hall on a fair and impartial trial be ad|judged of a pernicious tendency, is nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation of peace and good order, of government and religion, the only &s;olid foun|dations of civil liberty. Thus the will of individuals is &s;till left free; the abu&s;e only of that free will is the object of legal puni&s;hment. Nei|ther is any re&s;traint hereby laid upon freedom of thought or enquiry: liberty of private &s;entiment is &s;till left; the di&s;&s;eminating or making public, of bad &s;entiments, de&s;tructive of the ends of &s;ociety, is the crime which &s;ociety corrects. A man (&s;ays a fine writer on this &s;ubject) may be allowed to keep poi&s;ons in his clo&s;et, but not publicly to vend them as cordials. And to this we may add, that the only plau&s;ible argument heretofore u&s;ed for the re&s;training the ju&s;t freedom of the pre&s;s, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to prevent the daily abu&s;e of it, will entirely lo&s;e its force when it is &s;hewn (by a rea&s;onable exerci&s;e of the laws) that the pre&s;s cannot be abu&s;ed to any bad purpo&s;e, without incurring a &s;uitable puni&s;hment: whereas it never can be u&s;ed to any good one, when under the controul of an In&s;pector. So true will it be found, that to cen&s;ure the licentiou&s;ne&s;s, is to maintain the liberty of the pre&s;s.</Q> 4 Black. Com. 151.</P>
<P>It is believed, that iv every &s;tate in the union the common law princi|ples concerning libels apply; and in &s;ome of the &s;tates words &s;imilar to the words of the amendment are u&s;ed in the con&s;titution it&s;elf, or a contem|porary bill of rights of equal authority, without ever being &s;uppo&s;ed to exclude any law being pa&s;&s;ed on the &s;ubject. So that there is the &s;trong|e&s;t proof that can be of a univer&s;al concurrence in America on this point that the freedom of the pre&s;s does not require that libellers &s;hall be pro|tected from puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>But in &s;ome re&s;pects the act of congre&s;s is much more re&s;trictive than the principles of the common law, or than perhaps the principles of any &s;tate in the union. For under the law of the United States the truth of the matter may be given in evidence, which at common law in criminal pro&s;ecutions was held not to be admi&s;&s;ible; and the puni&s;hment of fine and impri&s;onment, which at common law was di&s;cretionary, is limited in point of &s;everity, though not of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nity. It is to be ob&s;erved too, that by the expre&s;s words of the act both malice and fal&s;hood mu&s;t combine in the publication, with the &s;editions intent particularly de&s;cribed. So that if the writing be fal&s;e, yet not malicious, or malicious and not fal&s;e, no conviction can take place. This therefore fully provides for any pub|lication ari&s;ing from inadvertency, mi&s;take, fal&s;e confidence, or any thing
<PB N="14" REF="037104_0018_100D7DF7D7D83F80">
&s;hort of a wilful and atrocious fal&s;hood. And none &s;urely will contend that the publication of &s;uch a fal&s;hood is among the indefea&s;ible rights of men, for that would be to make the freedom of liars greater than that of men of truth and integrity.</P>
<P>I have now &s;aid all I thought material on the&s;e important &s;ubjects. There is another upon which it is painful to &s;peak, but the notoriety as well as the official certainty of the fact, and the importance of the dan|ger make it indi&s;pen&s;able. Such ince&s;&s;ant calumnies have been poured again&s;t the government for &s;uppo&s;ed breaches of the con&s;titution, that an in&s;urrection has lately began for a cau&s;e where no breach of the con&s;titu|tion is or can be pretended. The grievance is the land tax act, an act which the public exigencies rendered unavoidable, and is framed with par|ticular anxiety to avoid its falling oppre&s;&s;ively on the poor, and in effect the greate&s;t part of it mu&s;t fall on rich people only. Yet arms have been taken to oppo&s;e its execution: officers have been in&s;ul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed: the authority of the law re&s;i&s;ted: and the government of the United States treated with the utmo&s;t defiance and contempt. Not being thoroughly informed of all particulars, I cannot now &s;ay within what cla&s;s of offences the&s;e crimes are comprehended. But as &s;ome of the offenders are committed for trea&s;on, and many certainly have been guilty of combinations to re&s;i&s;t the law of the United States, I think it proper to point your attention particularly to tho&s;e &s;ubjects. The provi&s;ions in regard to the former, &s;o far as they may at pre&s;ent be deemed material or in&s;tructive, are as follow:</P>
<P><HI>(Here the passages referred to were read.)</HI></P>
<P>The only &s;pecies of trea&s;on likely to come before you is that of levy|ing war again&s;t the United States. There have been various opinions, and different determinations on the import of tho&s;e words. But I think I am warranted in &s;aying, that if in the ca&s;e of the in&s;urgents who may come under your con&s;ideration the intention was to prevent by &s;o force of arms the execution of any a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, of the Congre&s;s of the United States al|together (as for in&s;tance the land tax act, the object of their oppo&s;ition) any forcible oppo&s;ition calculated to carry that intention into effect was a levying of war again&s;t the United States, and of cour&s;e an act of trea&s;on. But if the intention was, merely to defeat its operation in a particular in|&s;tance, or through the agency of a particular officer, from &s;ome private or per&s;onal motive, though a higher offence may have been committed, it did not amount to the crime of trea&s;on. The particular motive mu&s;t however be the &s;ole ingredient in the ca&s;e, for if combined with a general view to ob&s;truct the execution of the act, the offence mu&s;t be deemed trea&s;on.</P>
<P>With regard to the number of witne&s;&s;es in trea&s;on, I am of opinion that two are nece&s;&s;ary on the indictment as well as upon the trial in court.</P>
<P>The provi&s;ion in the con&s;titution, that the two witne&s;s mu&s;t be to the &s;ame overt-act, (or actual deed con&s;tituting the trea&s;onable offence) was in con&s;equence of a con&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> which had prevailed in England, that though two witne&s;&s;es were required to prove an act of trea&s;on, yet if one witne&s;s proved one act, and another witne&s;s another act of the &s;ame &s;pecies of trea&s;on, (as for in&s;tance that of levying war) it was &s;ufficient; a deci&s;ion which has always appeared to me contrary to the true intention of the law which made two witne&s;&s;es nece&s;&s;ary&mdash;this provi&s;ion being, as I con|ceived, intended to guard again&s;t fictitious charges of trea&s;on, which an un|principled
<PB N="15" REF="037104_0019_100D7DF986C6FC40">
government might be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to &s;upport and encourage, even at the expence of perjury, a thing much more difficult to be effected by two witne&s;&s;es than one.</P>
<P>An act of Congre&s;s which I have already read to you (that commonly called the &s;edition act) has &s;pecially provided in the manner you have heard, again&s;t combinations to defeat the execution of the laws. The combinations puni&s;hable under this act mu&s;t be di&s;tingui&s;hed from &s;uch as in them&s;elves amount to trea&s;on, which is unalterably fixed by the con|&s;titution it&s;elf. Any combinations, therefore, which be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e the pa&s;&s;ing of this act, would have amounted to trea&s;on, &s;till con&s;titute the &s;ame crime. To give the act in que&s;tion a different con&s;truction, would do away alto|gether the crime of trea&s;on as committed by levying war, becau&s;e no war can be levied without a combination for &s;ome of the purpo&s;es &s;tated in the act, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily con&s;titute a part though not the whole of the offence.</P>
<P>Long, gentlemen, as I have detained you, for which the great importance of the occa&s;ion, I tru&s;t, is a ju&s;t apology, it will be u&s;eful to recollect, that ever &s;ince the fir&s;t formation of the pre&s;ent government, every act which any extraordinary difficulty has occa&s;ioned, has been uniformly oppo&s;ed before its adoption, and every art practi&s;ed to make the people di&s;content|ed after it: without any allowance for the nece&s;&s;ity which dictated them &s;ome &s;eem to have taken it for granted that credit could be obtained without ju&s;tice, money without taxes, and the honour and &s;afety of the United States only pre&s;erved by a di&s;graceful foreign dependence. But, notwith&s;tanding all the efforts made to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">llify and undermine the govern|ment, it has uniformily ro&s;e in the e&s;teem and confidence of the people. Time has di&s;proved arrogant predictions; a true knowledge of the princi|ples and conduct of the government has rectified many gro&s;s mi&s;repre&s;en|tations; credit has ri&s;en from its a&s;hes; the country has been &s;ound full of re&s;ources, which have been drawn without oppre&s;&s;ion, and faithfully ap|plied to the purpo&s;es to which they were appropriated; ju&s;tice is imparti|ally admini&s;tered; and the only crime which is fairly imputable is, that the minority have not been &s;uffered to govern the majority, to which they had as little preten&s;ion upon the ground of &s;uperiority of talents, patrioti&s;m, or general probity, as upon the principles of republicani&s;m, the perpetual theme of their declamation. If you &s;uffer this government to be de&s;troy|ed, what chance have you for any other? A &s;cene of the mo&s;t dreadful confu&s;ion mu&s;t en&s;ue. Anarchy will ride triumphant, and all lovers of or|der, decency, truth and ju&s;tice be trampled under foot. May that God who&s;e peculiar providence &s;eems often to have interpo&s;ed to &s;ave the&s;e United States from de&s;truction, pre&s;erve us from this wor&s;t of all evils! And may the inhabitants of this happy country de&s;erve his care and pro|tection by a conduct be&s;t calculated to obtain them.</P>

<HEAD>MR. SITGREAVES opened the trial as follows:</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY the indictment which has been ju&s;t read to you, you perceive that John Fries, the pri&s;oner at the bar, has put him&s;elf on trial before you, on an accu&s;ation of having committed the greate&s;t offence which can be perpetrated in this, or any other country, and it will devolve on you to determine, according to the evidence which will be produced to you, on the important que&s;tion of life or death. It is the duty of the&s;e that pro|&s;ecute, to open to you, as clear as they are able, tho&s;e principles of law which apply to the offender, and then to &s;tate to you the te&s;timony with which the accu&s;ation is &s;upported. This duty has devolved upon me, and I hope, while I regard my duty as accu&s;er, I &s;hall do it in &s;uch a way as &s;hall do no inju&s;tice to the pri&s;oner. However, if I &s;hould be incorrect, there are &s;ufficient opportunities for me to be corrected by the vigilance which the council engaged on behalf of the pri&s;oner will u&s;e, and the or|der which the court will ob&s;erve. The&s;e are &s;ufficient to correct any mis-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tements, but I will u&s;e my utmo&s;t endeavours to be guilty of none.</P>
<P>The pri&s;oner is indicted of the crime of trea&s;on. Trea&s;on is defined in the con&s;titution of the United States, Section 3. Art. 3. in the words following:</P>
<P>"Trea&s;on again&s;t the United States, &s;hall con&s;i&s;t only in levying war again&s;t them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and com|fort."</P>
<P>This crime appears to be limited to two de&s;criptions: the one, levying war again&s;t the United States, and the other adhering to its enemies. With re&s;pect to the latter branch of the de&s;cription, there will be no oc|ca&s;ion
<PB N="19" REF="037104_0023_100D7E040D94E9D8">
for any explanation, or to call your attention in the lea&s;t to it, be|cau&s;e it is not charged upon the pri&s;oner; he if charged with having committed trea&s;on in levying war.</P>
<P>This expre&s;&s;ion, phra&s;eology, or de&s;cription as adopted by our con&s;titu|tion, is burrowed from a &s;tatute of Great Britain, pa&s;&s;ed in the reign of Edward III. which has, ever &s;ince it pa&s;&s;ed, commanded the veneration and re&s;pect of that nation, almo&s;t equal with their great charter: it is con&s;idered as a great &s;ecurity to their liberties. Indeed the uniform and unanimous con&s;ent given to this &s;tatute, through a great lap&s;e of time, by the mo&s;t able writers on law; its never having undergone the lea&s;t al|teration amid&s;t the mo&s;t &s;evere &s;crutinies, and its adoption into the con&s;ti|tution of the United States, without the lea&s;t amendment, are &s;ufficient encomiums to prove its worth. I &s;hall &s;tate to you, as far as is nece&s;&s;ary to the pre&s;ent application of that &s;tatute, the mo&s;t able and judicious ex|po&s;itions, but without recurring to a variety of authorities which might be quoted.</P>
<P>The crime of trea&s;on, as it has been laid down by tho&s;e writers, gene|rally allowed to be the mo&s;t able on law, who&s;e accuracy is unque&s;tionable, is the highe&s;t crime that can po&s;&s;ibly be committed again&s;t the good go|vernment of a nation, and a con&s;iderable inroad into the liberties of a &s;ubject. In di&s;cu&s;&s;ing this crime I &s;hall only recur to the notes which I have taken, and my own knowledge of the law; if that &s;tatement &s;hould he inaccurate, there are &s;ufficient opportunities for amendment in the cour&s;e of this trial, Trea&s;on con&s;i&s;ts in levying war again&s;t the govern|ment of the United States: it may confidently he &s;aid not only to con|&s;i&s;t in joining or aiding the ho&s;tile intentions of a foreign enemy; nor is it confined to rebellion in the broad &s;en&s;e in which that word is generally under&s;tood; or in the utter &s;ubver&s;ion of the government and its funda|mental in&s;titutions: but it al&s;o con&s;i&s;ts in the rai&s;ing a military force from among the people for the purpo&s;e of attaining any object with a de&s;ign of oppo&s;ing the lawful authority of the government by dint of arms, in &s;ome matter of public concern in which the in&s;urgents have no particular intere&s;t di&s;tinct from the re&s;t of the community. This is the be&s;t de&s;|cription of the crime trea&s;on, as it relates to the matter before you, which I am able to give. A tumultuou&s;ly rai&s;ing the people with force, for the purpo&s;e of &s;ubverting, or oppo&s;ing the lawful authority of the government in which tho&s;e in&s;urgents have no particular intere&s;t di&s;tinct from the people at large.</P>
<P>Agreeable to the divi&s;ion made in the definition of trea&s;on by Lord Hale, it mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t both in levying war, and in levying war again&s;t the government of the United States. Reflecting levying of war, it is to be under&s;tood, agreeable to the mo&s;t approved authorities, that there mu&s;t be an actual military array, I mention this becau&s;e I think it proper to be particular in &s;o e&s;&s;ential and important an enquiry, and becau&s;e I think we &s;hall prove to you that this was actually done by the pri&s;oner. Ano|ther thing I wi&s;h you to bear in mind is, that war may be &s;ufficiently levied again&s;t the United States, although no violence be u&s;ed, and al|though no battle be fought. It is not nece&s;&s;ary that actual violence &s;hould take place, to prove the actual waging of war. If the arrange|ments are made, and the numbers of armed men actually appear, &s;o as to procure the object which they have in view by Intimidation, as well as by actual force , that will con&s;titute the offence.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="037104_0024_100D7E0671EE6CC8">
It mu&s;t be war waged again&s;t the United States. This is an impor|tant di&s;tinction. A large a&s;&s;emblage of people may come together; in whatever numbers; however they may be armed or arrayed, or whatever degree of violence they may commit, yet that alone would not con&s;titute trea&s;on: the trea&s;on mu&s;t be known; it mu&s;t be for a public and not a private revenge; it mu&s;t be avowedly levying war again&s;t the United States; if people a&s;&s;emble in this ho&s;tile manner only to gratify revenge, or any other purpo&s;e independent of war again&s;t the United States, it will only amount to a riot; but if it is an object in which the per&s;on has no particular intere&s;t, this con&s;titutes the offence of trea&s;on. There are a variety of in&s;tances which might be produced in order to illu&s;trate this definition of the law, but it is not nece&s;&s;ary to turn to them. Suffice it to &s;ay that it is the intention or end for which an in&s;urrection is rai&s;ed, which con&s;titutes the crime. This of cour&s;e you will have in mind when the te&s;timony is gone into. I will ju&s;t ob&s;erve, as applicable to this ca&s;e, that one in&s;tance which is defined, of the crime of trea&s;on is, to defeat the operation of the laws of the government; any in&s;urrection, I will be bold to &s;ay, to defeat the execution of the public laws, amounts to trea&s;on; Having given you this explanation of trea&s;on, &s;o far as I &s;uppo&s;e is con|nected with the pre&s;ent awful occa&s;ion, I &s;hall now proceed to &s;tate the amount of evidence we mean to produce, in order to prove that the un|happy pri&s;oner was guilty of that high crime.</P>
<P>It will appear, gentlemen, from the te&s;timony which will be pre&s;ented to you, that during the latter months of the year 1798 di&s;cords prevailed to an enormous extent throughout a large portion of the counties of Bucks, Northampton, and Montgomery, and that con&s;iderable difficulties attended the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors for the direct tax in the execution of the duties of their a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment. It is not in the nature of this enquiry to explain for what purpo&s;e, or by what means the oppo&s;ition was made: it is not ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;ay whether the complaints urged were well or ill founded, be|cau&s;e it is a &s;ettled point that any in&s;urrection for removing public griev|ances, whether the complaints be real or pretended, amounts to trea&s;on, becau&s;e it is not the mode pointed out by law for obtaining redre&s;s. It will then be &s;ufficient to &s;how you that di&s;contents did exi&s;t, and that in various town&s;hips of tho&s;e counties; that in &s;everal town&s;hips, a&s;&s;ociations of the people were actually formed, in order to prevent the per&s;ons charged with the execution of tho&s;e laws of the United States from performing their duty upon them, and more particularly to prevent the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors from mea&s;uring their hou&s;es: this oppo&s;ition was made at many public town|&s;hip meetings called for the purpo&s;e, in many in&s;tances re&s;olutions were entered into, and reduced to writing, &s;olemnly forewarning the officers who&s;e duty it was to execute the laws, and the&s;e, many times accompa|nied with threats if they &s;hould perform that duty. Not only &s;o, but di&s;contents prevailed to &s;uch an height, that even the friends of the go|vernment in that part were compleatly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, by menaces again&s;t any who &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e officers in their duty: repeated declarations were made, both at public, as well as at private meetings, that if any per&s;on &s;hould be arre&s;ted by the civil authority, &s;uch arre&s;t would be followed by the ri&s;ing of the people, in oppo&s;ition to that authority, for the purpo&s;e of re&s;cuing &s;uch arre&s;ted pri&s;oners: it will appear to you farther, gentlemen, in the cour&s;e of evidence, that during tho&s;e di&s;|contents, indefatigable pains were taken by tho&s;e who were charged with
<PB N="21" REF="037104_0025_100D7E099F5AEAA0">
the execution of the laws, to calm the fears, and to remove the mi&s;appre|hen&s;ions of the infatuated people; for this purpo&s;e they road and explained the law to them, and informed them that they were mi&s;led into the idea that the law was not in force, for that it actually was; at the &s;ame time warning them of the con&s;equences which would flow from oppo&s;ition, and this was accompanied with promi&s;es that even their mo&s;t capricious wi&s;hes would be gratified on their obedience. The favour was in many in&s;tan|ces granted, that where any oppo&s;ition was made to any certain per&s;on executing the office of a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, in &s;ome town&s;hips propo&s;als were made for the people to choo&s;e for them&s;elves, but notwith&s;tanding this accom|modating offer, the oppo&s;ition continued.</P>
<P>After having &s;howed to you the general extent of this combination and dangerous con&s;piracy, which exi&s;ted in all the latitude I have opened to your view, we &s;hall next give in evidence full proof, that the con&s;equen|ces were, actual oppo&s;ition and re&s;i&s;tance: in &s;ome parts violence was actually u&s;ed, and the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors were taken and impri&s;oned by armed par|ties, and in other mobs a&s;&s;embled to compel them, either to deliver up their papers, or to re&s;ign their commi&s;&s;ions; that in &s;ome in&s;tances they were threatened with bodily harm, &s;o that in tho&s;e parts, the obnoxious law did remain unexecuted in con&s;equence of this alarm. Seeing the &s;tate of in&s;urrection and rebellion had ari&s;en to &s;uch a height, it became nece&s;&s;ary, in order to &s;upport the dignity, and indeed the very exi&s;tence of the government, that &s;ome means &s;hould be adopted to compel the execu|tion of tho&s;e laws, and warrants were in con&s;equence i&s;&s;ued again&s;t cer|tain per&s;ons who had &s;o oppo&s;ed the laws: The&s;e proce&s;&s;es being put into the hands of the mar&s;hal of the di&s;trict, were &s;erved upon &s;ome of them: in &s;ome in&s;tances during the execution of that duty the mar&s;hal met with in&s;ult, and almo&s;t with violence: having however, got nearly the whole of the warrants &s;erved, he appointed head quarters for the&s;e pri|&s;oners to rendezvous at Bethelem, where &s;ome of them were to enter bail for their appearance in the city, and others were to come to the city in cu&s;tody, for trial. It will appear to you, that on the day thus appointed for the pri&s;oners to meet, and when a number of them had actually a&s;|&s;embled agreeable to appointment, that a number,&mdash;parties in arms, both hor&s;e and foot, more than an hundred men, accoutred with all their mili|tary apparatus, commanded in &s;ome in&s;tances by their proper officers, marched to Bethlehem, collected before the hou&s;e in which were the mar&s;hal and pri&s;oners, whom they demanded to be delivered up to them, and in con&s;equence of refu&s;al, they proceeded to act very little &s;hort of actual ho&s;tility, &s;o that the mar&s;hal deemed it prudent to accede to their de|mands, and the pri&s;oners were I berated.</P>
<P>This, gentlemen, is the general hi&s;tory of the in&s;urrection, I &s;hall now &s;tate to you the part which the unfortunate pri&s;oner at the bar took in tho&s;e ho&s;tile tran&s;actions. It will appear that the pri&s;oner is an inhabi|tant of the town&s;hip of lower Milford in the county of Bucks, that &s;ome|time in February la&s;t a public meeting was held at the hou&s;e of one John Kline in that town&s;hip, to con&s;ider in relation to this hou&s;e tax, what was to be done: that at that meeting certain re&s;olutions were entered into, and a paper &s;igned; (we have endeavoured to trace this paper, &s;o as to produce it to the court and jury, but have failed) this paper was &s;ign|ed by fifty two per&s;ons and committed to the hands of one of their num|ber:
<PB N="22" REF="037104_0026_100D7E0B6F058D48">
John Fries was pre&s;ent at this meeting, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in drawing up the paper, at which time his expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t this law were extremely violent, and he threatened to &s;hoot one of the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, Mr. Foulke, through the legs if he did proceed to a&s;&s;e&s;s the hou&s;es. Again, the pri|&s;oner, at a vendue, threatened another of the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, Mr. S. Clarke, that if he attempted to go on with the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments he &s;hould be commit|ted to an old &s;table, and there fed on rotten corn: we &s;hall further prove that upon its being intimated by force of them to Mr. Chapman, princi|pal a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, that if they might choo&s;e their own a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors things would go on quietly, he directed that they &s;hould do &s;o, but &s;till they continued in oppo&s;ition to the law, and would not choo&s;e an officer at all. A general meeting was called to read and explain the law to the people, and thus remove any wrong impre&s;&s;ions and mi&s;-apprehen&s;ions: the principal a&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or was at that meeting, but the rudene&s;s, oppo&s;ition and violence, u&s;ed by the people, prevented him from doing &s;o, which was an evident proof that they did not want to hear the law, and that they under&s;tood enough of it to oppo&s;e it: thus the benevolent intentions of that meeting was fru&s;trated. We &s;hall farther &s;how you that the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of lower Milford was intimidated &s;o as to decline making the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments, and that the prin|cipal a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or together with three other a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, were obliged to go into that town&s;hip to execute the law; that they proceeded in the execution of their duty during a part of the day of the 5th of March la&s;t, without any impediment; that at eleven o'clock in the morning Mr. Chapman met, at the hou&s;e of Jacob Fries in lower Milford, with the pri&s;oner, when he, the pri&s;oner, declared his determination not to &s;ubmit, but to oppo&s;e the law, and that by the next morning he could rai&s;e 700 men in oppo&s;ition to it: that upon Mr. Chapman telling him, that many hou&s;es were a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, the pri&s;oner flew into a violent pa&s;&s;ion, ab&s;olutely declaring that it &s;hould &s;oon be in this country as it was in France. We &s;hall farther &s;hew you, that at another time during the &s;ame day the pri&s;oner met with two of the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors Mr. Rodrick and Mr. Foulke, whom he warned not to proceed in the execution of their duty, accompanied with threats that if they did, they would be hurt, and left them in a great rage. Farther, he proceeded to collect parties, with whom he went in &s;earch of tho&s;e men, and attacked them in executing their duty, one of them e&s;|caped, but the other he took, but not having got Mr. Roderick, who ap|peared to be a particular object of re&s;entment, he let Mr. Foulke go, telling him he would have them again the next day. He told Mr. Clarke that if he had met with Rodrick he would not have let him go &s;o ea&s;y, and declared to him &s;olemnly and repeatedly, that it was his deter|mination to oppo&s;e the laws. We &s;hall farther &s;how you that, after ha|ving di&s;charged Foulke, he proceeded to Collect a large party in the town|&s;hip, in order to take the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors is the next day. Accordingly on the day following a numerous party, to wit, about 50 or 60, the greate&s;t part of whom were in arms, collected together and pur&s;ued the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, and not finding them in that town&s;hip, pur&s;ued them into another, in order, net on|ly to cha&s;e them out of the town&s;hip, but generally to prevent them exe|cuting their duty. This party collected, not only many of them in arms, but in military array, with drum and fife, and commanded by this Captain Fries and one Kuyder: Fries him&s;elf was armed with a large hor&s;e pi&s;|tol. Thus equipped, they went to Quaker town, in order to accompli&s;h
<PB N="23" REF="037104_0027_100D7E0D3259D0F8">
their purpo&s;e, where they found the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, two of whom they took, but Rodrick tied. Fries ordered his men to fire at the man who fled, and the piece was &s;napped, but did not go off. Fries did then compel Foulke to deliver up to them his papers, but not finding in them what they ex|pected, they were returned, but at the &s;ame time exacting a promi&s;e that he, the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, &s;hould not proceed in the valuation of the hou&s;es in lower Milford. Fries was in many in&s;tances extremely violent again&s;t this law, and preremptory in his determination not to &s;ubmit to it, as will appear by the evidence.</P>
<P>When they left Quaker town they met with a travelling man who ex|pre&s;&s;ed &s;ome good will towards the government, and for that expre&s;&s;ion, they mal-treated him very much, and expre&s;&s;ed their general di&s;like to all who &s;upported the &s;ame principles. During the time they were at Quaker town, intimation was received that the mar&s;hal had taken a number of per&s;ons pri&s;oners in con&s;equence of oppo&s;ing the execution of this law, whereupon a determination was formed among&s;t the&s;e people to go and effect their re&s;cue, and the people of Milford were generally invited to a&s;&s;i&s;t in this bu&s;ine&s;s. When they were going, the parted halted at the hou&s;e of John Fries, and then a paper was &s;igned, by which they bound them|&s;elves volunteers to go upon the execution of this de&s;ign, this paper was written by the pri&s;oner at the bar, and &s;igned by him and the re&s;t: there|in they engaged to go and re&s;cue the pri&s;oners who had been arre&s;ted by the mar&s;hal. On the morning of the next day 20 or more of them met at the hou&s;e of Conrad Marks, in arms, to go on with their de&s;ign. John Fries was armed with a &s;word, and had a feather in his hat. On the road, as they went forward they were met by young Marks, who told them that they might as well turn about, for that the Northampton people were &s;trong enough to do the bu&s;ine&s;s without tho&s;e from Bucks county: &s;ome were &s;o inclined to do, but at the in&s;tance of Fries and &s;ome others, they did go forward, and actually proceeded to Bethlehem. Before the arrival of the&s;e troops, a party, going on the &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s, had &s;topped at the bridge, a &s;mall di&s;tance from Bethlehem, when they had been met by a deputation from the mar&s;hal, whom be had prevailed on to go and meet them, in order to advi&s;e them to return home: they agreed to halt there, and &s;end three of their number to declare to the mar&s;hal what was their demand: it was during this period that Fries and his party came up, but it appears that when they came, Fries took the party actually over the bridge and that he arranged the toll with the man, and ordered them to proceed. With re&s;pect to proof of the pro|ceedings at Bethlehem, it cannot be mi&s;taken: he was there the leading man, and he appears to enjoy the command. With the con&s;ent of his people he demanded the pri&s;oners of the mar&s;hal, and when that officer told him that he could not &s;urrender them, except they were taken from him by force, and produced his warrant for taking them, the pri&s;oner then harrangued his party out of the hou&s;e, and explained to them the nece&s;&s;ity of u&s;ing force; and that you &s;hould not mi&s;take his de&s;ign, we will prove to you that he declared, "that was the third day which he had been out on this expedition, that he had had a &s;kirmi&s;h the day before, and if the pri&s;on|ers were not relea&s;ed he &s;hould have another that day. NOW you ob&s;erve," re&s;umed he, "that force is nece&s;&s;ary, but you mu&s;t obey my orders, we will not go without taking the pri&s;oners; but take my orders, you mu&s;t
<PB N="24" REF="037104_0028_100D7E108180EB10">
not fire fir&s;t: mu&s;t be fir&s;t fired upon, and when I am gone, then you mu&s;t do as well as you can, as I expect to be the fir&s;t man that falls." He farther declared to the mar&s;hal; that they " would fire till a cloud of &s;moak prevented them &s;eeing one another; and executing the office of commander of the troops which at that time over awed the mar&s;hal and his attendants, harrangued the troops to obey his orders, which they accor|dingly did, and the mar&s;hal was really intimidated to liberate the pri&s;on|ers; and then the object was accompli&s;hed, and the party di&s;per&s;ed, amid&s;t the huzzas of the in&s;urgents. After this affair at Bethlehem, it will be given you in evidence that the pri&s;oner frequently avowed his oppo&s;ition to the laws, and ju&s;tified that outrage; and when a meeting was after|wards held at lower Milford to choo&s;e a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, the pri&s;oner refu&s;ed his a&s;&s;ent to the accommodating object of the meeting, and appeared as violent as ever.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ome of the points we mean to prove before you. I &s;hall
therefore at pre&s;ent proceed to introduce our te&s;timony.</P>

<P>I arrived there on the evening of the 6th&mdash;we had heard that there was a party of men would collect, for the purpo&s;e of re&s;cuing the pri&s;oners who were there in cu&s;tody of the mar&s;hal, in con&s;equence of that I went to a&s;&s;i&s;t the, mar&s;hal, and, if po&s;&s;ible, prevail on the people to de&s;i&s;t.&mdash;The witne&s;s &s;aid he was one of the judges of the court of common plea&s;e for the county of Northampton&mdash;About ten o'clock on the morning of the 7th two men with arms arrived at the tavern where we were, the name of one was Keifer, and the other Paulus: they were called into the hou&s;e, and enquired of by the mar&s;hal as to their intention in coming armed, they appeared to be diffident about an an&s;wer; after fir&s;t &s;aying they came upon a &s;hooting frolic, Keifer &s;aid they were come in order to &s;ee what was be&s;t to be done for the country: after that came in &s;everal others three of them were David Shaef, Jacob Kline, and Philip Te&s;ch, armed and on hor&s;e back, two of them in uni|form, with &s;words and pi&s;tols: the two fir&s;t men were placed with the mar&s;hal in a &s;eparate room, in order to await the i&s;&s;ue; at this time a con&s;iderable number of people had a&s;&s;embled. Henry Shankwyler was in company with the three men: the mar&s;hal fir&s;t went and &s;poke to the&s;e men as to their intention, I al&s;o walked out for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, reque&s;t|ing them to withdraw, and not appear in arms in order to ob&s;truct the proce&s;s of the United States laws: Shaeff and Kline an&s;wered that they were freemen, and might go where they plea&s;ed with their arms: I told them that they ran great ri&s;k by appearing in arms for &s;uch a purpo&s;e as I feared they were come.</P>

<P>We reque&s;ted them to deliver up their arms, but they refu&s;ed.

After this I returned into the lower back room of the hou&s;e, by this time there were a number more collected round the hou&s;e, but mo&s;tly armed. I don't recollect whether it was before the&s;e

three men arrived or not, that the mar&s;hal had &s;ent off four men of his po&s;&s;e, in order to meet the men with arms who were coming forward, and after we were up &s;tairs there were three men arrived as a deputation from the armed body, making enquiry as to the intention of the mar&s;hal in taking the&s;e pri&s;oners: with the&s;e 3 men the 4 deputed by the mar&s;hal had returned from the armed body that was the other &s;ide of the bridge, in order to learn the mar&s;hal's object. The mar&s;hal a&s;&s;ured them of the legality of the proce&s;s, and rea&s;oned with them as to the con&s;equences of oppo&s;ition, or threats to him, or preventing him from executing his duty, but I believe he liberated the two men that were fir&s;t put in confine|ment, and returned them their guns again. During the time that the&s;e two men were in confinement we examined their guns, and found that they were both loaded. I was pretty much in the lower part of the hou&s;e backward, and there was much of the proceedings of the&s;e people I did not &s;ee, in the front of the hou&s;e, but I endeavoured to conver&s;e with as many as I knew, informing them of the badne&s;s of their conduct, and the con&s;equence of it, but it appeared to be to no effect, as I knew. About one o'clock I think I fir&s;t &s;aw what was called the main body of this armed force, marching up the &s;treet: there was a party of hor&s;e preceded the foot came riding up two a brea&s;t, I am not certain whether they had their &s;words drawn, but I believe they had, and then followed the foot, march|ing up in Indian (&s;ingle) file, when they came up the foot marched twice round the tavern, and placed them&s;elves in front of the hou&s;e, where they &s;tood &s;ome time drawn up in &s;ingle rank, I believe they were rifle-men they continued there till the re&s;cue was effected. During this time I frequently heard that the pri&s;oners were demanded by them, and they, in|&s;i&s;ted on their relea&s;e.</P>

<P>No, I did not, but I heard in the hou&s;e that it had been made; I al&s;o heard that they intended to force their pa&s;&s;age up &s;tairs.

The people appeared very noi&s;y in the lower part of the hou&s;e, all this time, I frequently heard the cry of " deliver up the pri&s;oners," and it appeared to come from the party at the foot of the &s;tairs. During the affair, I am not certain whether it was previous to this or not, I looked out and &s;aw &s;ix or eight men at the foot of the &s;tairs and the pri&s;oner on the &s;tairs conver&s;ing with the mar&s;hal: while I was &s;tanding there, there was an old man, whom I under&s;tood afterwards to be John Kline, came running in from the front door, and called for captain Fries in German, telling him there was his &s;word; (offering it) I think he called three different times, on which I ob&s;erved the pri&s;oner wave his hand and tell him to wait, it was not quite time yet; &s;hortly after the pri&s;oners were given up.

<P>I was &s;ummoned to attend the mar&s;hal on the &s;eventh of March at Bethlehem, as one of his po&s;&s;e.

We went on about a mile from Bethlehem, and cro&s;&s;ed the Lehi, and there we met a party of hor&s;emen fir&s;t: they were armed. I did not know any of them, but under&s;tood they were from Northampton county, near about Millar's town. When we came up to them, we a&s;ked
<PB N="29" REF="037104_0033_100D7E1C11FA7290">
them for their commanding officer. They made an&s;wer that they had no officers; they were all commanders. We then told them what our errand was&mdash;to try to prevail upon them not to go on any farther, but they did not &s;eem to mind it much. We were with them but a very little time, before there was a company of rifle men came up, they were armed as well as the others. We told them our errand, but they did not &s;eem to mind us. We then returned, and came on with them to the bridge of the Lehi, where we halted. There we talked with them a great while, but &s;till they wanted to go on. We told them we came from the mar&s;hal, and a&s;ked them what they wanted by going into Bethlehem with their arms. They &s;aid the mar&s;hal had two of their men that had come to Bethlehem under arms, and had put them under guard, and they wanted them, and they would have them two men &s;et at liberty, and one of the name of Shankwyler. As I found that they were determined to go, I a&s;ked if they would not allow that if any one had done wrong, they ought to &s;uffer for it: They agreed that they ought, but they &s;hould not be taken to Philadelphia, but have been tried in Northampton county. When we found that they were determined to go on, we agreed that they had better &s;end two or three men over to the mar&s;hal, and not to go bodily. Which they agreed to, and appointed three men to go, and they &s;ent them over.</P>

We then all went over together to the tavern at Bethlehem, where the mar&s;hal was. They &s;poke to him, told him what their bu&s;ine&s;s was, and he gave the two men up to them. When they were given up, we went back, with them, in order to go to where we had left the remainder of the men. Going down through Bethlehem, we met a party of hor&s;emen, and we &s;topped them: they were armed; part of them were light hor&s;e|men; and part were other hor&s;emen: they all had &s;words or &s;ome arms or other. The light hor&s;e had their &s;words drawn. We told them that they had better go back, and not go up into the town, but they &s;eemed very anxious to go up. One of them made an&s;wer &s;omething like this: "This is the third day that I was out, I had a fight ye&s;terday, and I mean to have another to-day if they do not let the pri&s;oners clear.</P>

<SP>
<P>I did not take notice where they went to after they were relea&s;ed; they went on up town.&mdash;When I &s;aw the riflemen coming forward, I &s;topped till they came up, and then &s;poke to them: they &s;eemed that they would go on, but they promi&s;ed that they would do nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>Did you let them know that the two per&s;ons whom they had demanded were liberated?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>Yes, I did, and the three men who went with us told them al&s;o.&mdash;The hor&s;emen did not wait one moment, but hurried on: they all then march|ed up town, and formed right in front of the tavern: I returned with them. After they were formed there, I was among them, and talked with them a great deal, but could not do any thing with them:; If there was ten or twelve that agreed to be moderate the others would all in&s;i&s;t upon it, that they would have the pri&s;oners, all of them. We <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> there for nearly or quite two hours. This man, whom they called captain Fries, came out and mentioned to his men that he would now have the pri&s;oners, if any of them would go into the hou&s;e with him: he had been in backward and forward &s;everal times. He &s;aid he &s;hould go foremo&s;t. He told them that he would a&s;k the favour of them, that they were, none of them to fire fir&s;t, if they went in. He mentioned to them likewi&s;e, that there were &s;ome armed men on the &s;tairs belonging to the mar&s;hal. I did not expect he would go in: I was talking to &s;ome men there, when I looked round and &s;aw &s;ome of the men at the door: he &s;aid he would go forema&s;t: he &s;ignified, talking in German, that he &s;hould get a blow or a &s;troke: the neare&s;t tran&s;lation was, " I &s;hall get it."&mdash;I looking round, &s;aw the men going in at the door, and I followed them in: they were armed men. I did not &s;ee the pri&s;oner after he had mentioned them words. I got in, between the men and the &s;tairs at the foot of the &s;tairs: they halted there, I got in there, in order to keep them back from going up &s;tairs; I was there but a few minutes, when I &s;aw the pri&s;oners coming down &s;tairs.</P>

<P>Relate to the court what occurred on the 7th of March at Bethlehem.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WITNESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>On the 7th of March in the morning early, ju&s;t as I got up, the deputy mar&s;hal handed me a &s;ummons, at which I was a little fluttered till I read it over. The &s;ummons was, that I &s;hould be at Beth|lehem at 10 o'clock, to aid and a&s;&s;i&s;t the mar&s;hal in executing the laws of the United States. He al&s;o &s;ent me &s;ome blank &s;ummons, de&s;iring me to &s;ummon as many more as I plea&s;ed. I put Chri&s;tian Winters, and John Mohollan's names down; we could not find any more good per&s;ons for that bu&s;ine&s;s. About 10 o'clock I arrived at Bethlehem. I was there but a very &s;hort time, when &s;omebody came in, and &s;aid he had met 20 men at one place, 10 at another, &amp;c. walking towards a tavern, on the road, about 3 or 4 miles from Bethlehem; I cannot recollect its name. The mar&s;hal, Mr. Irely, Mr. Henry, Mr. Balliott and others agreed that they thought it would be be&s;t to &s;end three or four men to meet them, and to &s;top them on the road: it was then to be decided who &s;hould go. I mentioned that I thought John Mohollan and William Barnett could do more with them, than any body el&s;e. They were agreed upon as was Chri&s;tian Roth (or Rote) and another, but I&s;aac Hat&s;el went in his place. This was, conformable to agreement, two federali&s;ts and two anti-fede|rali&s;ts. They went and met them, I remained at the hou&s;e. They were
<PB N="32" REF="037104_0036_100D7E2396D34AD0">
not gone very long, indeed I think it was ju&s;t as they were getting upon their hor&s;es, there was two men, arrayed, and with arms; one had a rifle, and the other a &s;mooth bore piece. When they were come into the yard, the mar&s;hal went down into the yard to them, and talked to them; what he talked to them, I did not hear. However he took their arms away from them, and carried them up &s;tairs, and put them by them&s;elves. Directly after that, there was five or &s;ix hor&s;emen came, I was informed that there was one man of them named Shankwyler. The mar&s;hal and judge Henry went down to meet them, they a&s;ked them what they come there for: they &s;aid, they only came there to be Shankwyler's bail: and judge Henry then a&s;ked them what they did with their arms? They &s;aid they did not mean any harm with them. They then got off their hor&s;es, and went into a room with the judge and the mar&s;hal: what they &s;aid there, I do not know, for I did not hear them. Pre&s;ently after there came up a troop of hor&s;e, and behind them there was two companies of riflemen. They marched up right into the yard and formed before the door of the tavern.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>How many riflemen do you &s;uppo&s;e there was?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>About 50.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>Had the light hor&s;e their &s;words drawn?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>How many do you &s;uppo&s;e there were in the whole?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>On a rough calculation I &s;uppo&s;e 130 or 140 armed men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>How many was there of the mar&s;hal's po&s;&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>About 16 or 17.</P>
<P>After they had formed a line in the yard, about 15 or 20 minutes Captain Jarret arrived, when they gave three huzzas. He then went in|to the hou&s;e and talked with the Mar&s;hal: the Mar&s;hal reque&s;ted him to get the men to withdraw. He profe&s;&s;ed he would. He had arrived from Philadelphia, whither he had been to give bail. After this, Jarrett &s;taid at the tavern about two hours. The men kept regular order, and never &s;eparated. The Mar&s;hal appointed four of us, me and three others to keep the guard of the &s;tairs, armed with pi&s;tols, two at the bottom, and two at the head. I &s;erved my time, and the &s;econd time I was ordered on guard by Capt. Henry Snyder, I &s;taid on the platform at the turn of the &s;tairs, when Fries, the pri&s;oner, came up to me, and wanted to go up &s;tairs. I told him that he could not be permitted to go up &s;tairs with|out the Mar&s;hal's leave. I then a&s;ked him what he wanted? He an&s;wer|ed that he wanted to &s;ee the Mar&s;hal. I told him that I expected he could &s;ee him, and told &s;ome men at the head of the &s;tairs to call the Mar&s;hal out of the room. He came out, and I then told him the&s;e two gentlemen wanted to talk to him. He &s;aid I &s;hould let them pa&s;s. As Fries was the fir&s;t man, I let him pa&s;s on between me and the other guard. The other man wanted to go up, but I told him that one at a time was enough, and that when the other had done, he would be permitted to talk to him too. Fries then went up and told the Mar&s;hal what he came for: he replied that he was come for the relea&s;e of the pri&s;oners. I &s;tood clo&s;e by them when they were talking. The Mar&s;hal made an&s;wer that he could not give them up to him; he then told the Mar&s;hal that he would
<PB N="33" REF="037104_0037_100D7E2517E89B00">
have them. Well then, &s;aid the Mar&s;hal, you mu&s;t get them as well as you can; for he &s;aid it was out of his power to deliver them up; he dared not to do it. Fries then told the Mar&s;hal that he had a &s;kirmi&s;h ye&s;ter|day, and he expected to have another one to day; he then &s;aid to the Mar&s;hal, "As for you Mar&s;hal, I will vouch that none of my men will hurt you, but as for the other company I will not vouch for.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>Do you know what he meant by the other company?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>No.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>Where was Mr. Balliott and Mr. Irely at this time?</P>

<P>They were in the room where they commonly were, up &s;tairs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>What an&s;wer did the Mar&s;hal make to that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>I do not know.</P>
<P>With that both of them marched off. I remained on guard. A little while after this, I &s;aw the men coming in at the door, and they got into the entry, with arms. I did not know one of tho&s;e who came in except Fries: he returned with tho&s;e armed men. He had a &s;word in his band, but I think it was in its &s;cabbard. When they got into the entry, they were pre&s;&s;ed upon by the po&s;&s;e, who &s;oon got them clean out of the door. I then got off guard. The language of the men was, that they would have the pri&s;oners. I could not hear many of their expre&s;|&s;ions, becau&s;e I was chiefly up &s;tairs, but I heard them &s;ay they would not leave the ground till they had the pri&s;oners. The mar&s;hal at this time had gone back into the room. Before the pri&s;oners were relea&s;ed I was relieved. When they made the &s;econd attempt, I was up &s;tairs, looking out of the window. I believe Chri&s;tian Winters took my po&s;t. The&s;e pri&s;oners were at this time up &s;tairs in a room by them&s;elves.</P>

<P>I was &s;ummoned on the 7th of March to go up to Bethlehem, and I went accordingly: when I came there, which was about 11 or 12 o'clock&mdash;about the middle of the day, the fir&s;t man that I &s;ay come there armed was one Keifer: another, I think his name was Paul, came with him to the tavern: the mar&s;hal went out, and brought them into the hou&s;e, and took them up &s;tairs: I was on guard at that time, and with another, I was &s;et to &s;tand guard by them. As we were in the room together, I a&s;ked them one thing or another, and among&s;t the re&s;t, what they came there for. Keifer told me that he heard they had to meet there to-day, and that they had to decide about the laws; or to &s;ee how it was made out about the laws; I then a&s;ked him what made him carry a gun with him; why, he told me, ever &s;ince he had been a little boy, he was fond of &s;hooting, and therefore, whenever he went out on a frolic, he liked to take his gun along, for he liked to hear it crack once in a while. I told him that he really put him&s;elf in a great deal of trouble, he told me that he meant no harm by it; that he thought he could carry his gun when he plea&s;ed. After I was relieved from my po&s;t, I went to the back door, and &s;aw &s;everal people who &s;aid that they would not wi&s;h to be taken to Phi|ladelphia, they would be tried in their own county: they were not in arms. I then went up &s;tairs where the pri&s;oners were; I went into the front room where Mr. Eyerly, Mr. Henry and more were; I was then put to the top of the &s;tairs, and got orders that I &s;hould not let any body up or down without their orders. I had a pi&s;tol with me. Nothing happened while I &s;taid there, but after I was relieved, I &s;aw Mr. Fries &s;tanding on the platform of the &s;tairs, talking to the mar&s;hal. I could not then hear all that pa&s;&s;ed, but what I heard him &s;ay was " I have been out, either two or three days on this bu&s;ine&s;s, and I had a &s;kirmi&s;h ye&s;terday, and I expect I will have another to-day." He &s;aid that if the mar&s;hal did not give up the pri&s;oners he would have one to-day. This was &s;omething like his words, though I &s;tood at a little di&s;tance. I heard the mar&s;hal &s;ay he could not give them up. This was his meaning, but there were &s;o many words I could not make out.</P>

I a&s;k|ed what they were after; I could not make out who it was, but &s;ome|body &s;aid, we will obey our captain's orders. I then went back, and went to the platform of the &s;tairs, one of the guard a&s;ked what was the matter? I told him there was danger coming on. He then handed me his pi&s;tol, and another man handed me another pi&s;tol, and I &s;taid on the platform in the front. At this time there was judge Mohollan, and I

<P>On the 7th of March, I was &s;ummoned to go to Bethlehem, but did not know what it was for. About 11 o'clock I got to Bethlehem, when I came, Mr. Eyerly came to me, and told me &s;ome men were coming there to re&s;cue the pri&s;oners, I thought it not po&s;&s;ible, but he told me it was certain. When we had been there about three hours, there came two men on hor&s;eback, and had their arms, whereupon Mr. Mar&s;hal, my&s;elf and Mr. Philip Sheltz went down and a&s;ked them what they were about. They told us they were informed that there were a number of men met there to-day, &s;o they &s;aid they came there to &s;ee how they came on: they did not &s;ay what they heard they were to meet for. We took them and put them into the hou&s;e under guard, and took their arms from them. I then thought there was &s;omething in what Mr. Eyerly had mentioned to me. I then made an ob&s;ervation to Mr. Eyerly if he did not think it proper that one or two men &s;hould go and prevent the&s;e people coming. Mr. Eyerly told the mar&s;hal of it, and he thought it would be proper, there &s;hould be &s;ome men go. I agreed that if no one el&s;e would go, I would go by my&s;elf. I do not know who &s;poke to the others; but I, judge Mohollan, major Barnett, and&mdash;, went out. We met them within a mile of Bethlehem. I did not know a &s;ingle man of them, but judge Mohollan and major Barnett &s;poke to them fir&s;t, but I did not under&s;tand what they &s;aid. I went farther back, to the rear: I &s;aid to
<PB N="36" REF="037104_0040_100D7E2B1CC29838">
them what in the world are you about men; you will bring your&s;elves in|to great trouble. One of them mentioned, we don't know you: I men|tioned if you know me or not, you will thank me for it. I &s;aid, if you do not do as I advi&s;e you, you will be &s;orry for twenty years after this; &s;o there was one of them that levelled his gun at me: &s;aid I, little man, con&s;ider what you are about; don't be too much in a hurry: then &s;ome of his comrades pu&s;hed him back. Then that man hallowed out, march on, don't mind this people: I do not know his name. They then marched on to the bridge, and there we &s;topped them again. They then agreed among&s;t them&s;elves that they would &s;end three men with us to the mar&s;hal, to &s;ee if they could get the two pri&s;oners we took at fir&s;t, liberated, and gave their honour that none of them &s;hould come over the bridge with arms. We then went with the&s;e three men to the tavern, at Bethlehem. They then went to the mar&s;hal and agreed with him, and the two pri|&s;oners were di&s;charged, but he &s;at down their names. I do not recollect their names. When the&s;e two men were di&s;charged, we went to go back with them again, but when we came to the lower end of Bethlehem, there was that company and another coming on, and there was no &s;top|ping them again.</P>

<P>No, not till they came near to the tavern, then they drew their &s;words, a great number of them. Before we &s;tarted from the bridge, we a&s;ked them again what they were about? they told us that they were inform|ed that they had taken a number of pri&s;oners, and that they would take them to Philadelphia, and put them in gaol there, and no bail would be taken for them: we a&s;ked them what pri&s;oners it was they meant? they mentioned one name only that I recollect, which was one Shankwyler. They mentioned that they would not &s;uffer Shankwyler to be put to gaol in Philadelphia: they mentioned that they would give bail ten double for him, or that they might put him in gaol in our own county, and try him in our own county. I &s;aw one Schwartz come up into the room where the mar&s;hal was.</P>

<SPEAKER>WITNESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some time between the 20th and 26th of February the warrants I now hold in my hand were given to me by the attorney of the di&s;trict, with orders for me to go to Northampton county to execute them. I &s;at out on the 26th and after &s;erving &s;ome &s;ubpoeneas on the road, in order to get &s;ome evidence about &s;ome matters that were wanted to be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, I got to Nazareth en the fir&s;t of March, next morning, Mr. Eyerman and my&s;elf went into Lehi town&s;hip to &s;erve &s;ome warrants upon &s;ome per&s;ons who had given their oppo&s;ition to the hou&s;e tax law. I think we got twelve of them that day, the others were not to be found. I think there were five of them, however they came in afterwards. We then returned to Bethlehem, and there met with Col. Balliott. We went then to Macungy town&s;hip, and there we met with no difficulty till we went to the hou&s;e of George Syder; I had a &s;ubpoene on him: he and his wife in&s;ulted us very much; his wife began abu&s;ing us fir&s;t, and he came out with a club, and would by no means be pur&s;uaded to receive it I &s;uppo&s;e not under&s;tanding it: I gave it to a Mr. Schwartz, a neigh|bour, who undertook to deliver it to him. We then proceeded to Mil|lar's town, a few miles farther: on the way we &s;topped at the hou&s;e of the Rev. Mr. Bu&s;kirk, where we left our hor&s;es, and walked into the town, to the hou&s;e of George Shaeffer, to &s;erve a warrant on him; but were informed that he was not in town. We returned to the tavern, about the centre of the town, and there we &s;aw a con&s;iderable number of people a&s;&s;embled. Mr. Eyerly and my&s;elf walked over to Shankwyler. As we walked out, many people ran after us, and many ran pa&s;t us, and getting into the hou&s;e, filled the long room. There appeared to be about fifty men. Near the hou&s;e in which Shankwyler lived, we concluded it was bad policy to a&s;k for him, for by that means it was not likely we &s;hould find him. And therefore as colonel Balliott knew him, I got him to point him out to me; but upon ob&s;erving me, he withdrew into the croud, I followed him, and laid hold on him, and told him he was my pri&s;oner in the name of the United States. I told him I was the mar&s;hal of the United States for the Penn&s;ylvania di&s;trict. He retreated towards his barn. He afterwards called out that he would not hurt the mar&s;hal, but Eyerly and Balliott were damned ra&s;cals: after this the people called out to each other <HI>Schlaget, Schlaget:</HI> (&s;trike, &s;trike) This &s;eemed to be the general voice of the people. There was one of the Shaeffer's &s;eemed to be a prominent character; it was David.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="037104_0042_100D7E951DE2ECB8">
I told them the con&s;equence of their attempting to &s;trike: I had a pair of pi&s;tols, and finding the danger we were in, I pulled open the buttons of my great coat, that I might, if nece&s;&s;ary, get a ready gripe at them: whether they &s;aw them or not, I cannot &s;ay, but when they found that I was determined not to &s;uffer the&s;e people to be abu&s;ed, they were then a little quiet: they, however, pulled the cockade out of Mr. Bullion's hat, and I believe would have done more violence to him, had they dared. I called on Shankwryler to go with me to Bethlehem, and thence to Phila|delphia, but he &s;wore he would not: I told him the con&s;equence of re&s;i&s;t|ing the authority of the United States, that it would be ruin to him; he declared and &s;wore he would re&s;i&s;t he would not &s;ubmit, be the con&s;e|quence what it might. I told him it would ruin his intere&s;t and family; he &s;aid he would do it, if it was to the de&s;truction of his property, and children. However, he finally agreed to meet me at Bethlehem, but never promi&s;ed to &s;ubmit, or &s;urrender him&s;elf at pri&s;oner. He &s;poke a good deal about the &s;tamp act, and the hou&s;e tax; that &s;eemed to be the bone of contention, and he &s;aid he had fought again&s;t it, and would not &s;ubmit to it now; I told him he appeared to be too young to have fought on either &s;ide during the war: he then &s;aid, his father had, he then added that there were none in favour of tho&s;e laws but tories, and officers of government. I told him that, as to tory, that could not apply to me, that I had had a &s;hare in the revolution, and that I was as fond of liberty as any of them. We came away, and as we came out, Mr. Ey|erly and Mr. Balliott came out of the door, they huzzaed for liberty: I told them that I &s;hould join them in that, if they would huzza for liberty of the right kind; but this was licentious liberty. We then went with a con&s;table to arre&s;t Adam Stepham, Herman Hartman, and Daniel Everly. When I returned, I was informed that the re&s;cue of the pri&s;oners at Beth|lehem was intended. This was on the &s;ixth of March. I could &s;carcely conceive it po&s;&s;ible; I thought it was &s;omebody for their own diver&s;ion had rai&s;ed it merely to alarm us, until we got to Bethlehem, where we got that night. There we were informed that the report was &s;erious, and that it would be attempted by a body of armed men. On which I con&s;ulted with judge Henry, Mr. Balliott, Mr. Eyerly, Mr. Hor&s;efield, and general Brown. I had taken a bond of the Lehi people, with &s;ureties for their appearance. I &s;ent Mr. Weed over the mountain to arre&s;t Ire|man, the mini&s;ter, and John Fox, which he did. Seeing this matter very &s;erious and important, I reque&s;ted general Brown to remain at Bethlehem, as he had very great influence in that county: he &s;aid he was &s;o near home, that he &s;hould go home, as he had been &s;o long from his family. I then a&s;ked him to return in the morning, but he &s;eemed to think there was no nece&s;&s;ity for it, and did not. I then con&s;ulted what &s;teps it would be nece&s;&s;ary to take; I had &s;een an attorney, and told him I was ordered to call a <HI>posse commitatus</HI> in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, and al&s;o that I was ordered that they &s;hould not be an armed force; I then &s;poke to judge Henry, expecting that he could call out armed men, but he told me he could not, for he had received &s;imilar in&s;tructions. We then concluded to call about 20 men. He called this po&s;&s;e from the neighbourhood of Bethlehem and Ea&s;ton, about 18 of them came in. About 10 or 11 o'clock two men riding into the yard, di&s;mounted, and placed them&s;elves oppo&s;ite the door, by the &s;ide of each other; one of them had a long &s;mooth bore gun, and
<PB N="39" REF="037104_0043_100D7E96ACF73B00">
the other a rifle. Some people in the hou&s;e went out to &s;peak to them, and a&s;ked them what brought them there: they &s;eemed to be at a lo&s;s for an an&s;wer; I think one of them &s;aid they came out on a &s;hooting fro|lic: I then a&s;ked them what they meant to &s;hoot: they did not know, nor could they explain the object of their coming. I a&s;ked them what they meant to do: one of them &s;aid they meant to do what was be&s;t for the country. I then &s;uppo&s;ed that they would all come in by &s;traggling parties, and therefore thought it was the be&s;t way of making the bu&s;ine&s;s ea&s;y, was to lead them into the hou&s;e, which I did, and put their arms into the garrett. Shortly after, three hor&s;emen, armed, and, I think, in uniform came into the yard with Shankwyler: I went and &s;poke to them, and &s;ome went with me. I a&s;ked Shankwyler if he was come to deliver him&s;elf up; he an&s;wered no. I a&s;ked him what he came for, if he did not come to &s;urrender him&s;elf, he an&s;wered that he came to &s;ee his part|ner: on farther enquiry I found he meant his accu&s;er. By this time the people were collecting very fa&s;t, and &s;ame per&s;ons mentioned that there was an armed force down by the bridge. On con&s;ulting with the gen|tlemen who were with me, it was agreed that a few men &s;hould be &s;ent to &s;peak to them, and warn them of the danger they were in if they per|&s;i&s;ted in the mea&s;ure which we &s;uppo&s;ed they intended. It was accord|ingly agreed that four gentlemen &s;hould go, which they did, and in a little time returned with three of their force, as a deputation from them to &s;peak to me. I a&s;ked them what was meant by this armed force, and and what they intended by it: they an&s;wered me that they wanted to pre|vent my taking the pri&s;oners to Philadelphia. I told them that could not be, nor mu&s;t be; nor mu&s;t it be attempted, they had much better go back, and tell the people to go to their re&s;pective homes. I think they a&s;ked me, particularly for the two men who had fir&s;t been made pri&s;oners; I for|get whether I gave them up then, or &s;ome &s;hort time after; however, they were given up, and their guns were given up to them: they were both loaded, and one of them was putting a new flint into his gun, in the yard, before I went out to &s;peak to them. The &s;ame gentlemen who went down to &s;peak to them at the bridge, went down to them again, and, a &s;hort time afterward, we ob&s;erved that they were coming up in force, up the &s;treet, Mr. Muhollan riding with the foremo&s;t of them, and &s;peaking to them: the hor&s;emen, &s;uch as had &s;words, had them drawn: the infan|try marched with trailed arms. The pri&s;oner at the bar was at the head of the infantry, with his &s;word drawn: the hor&s;e marched into the yard, and formed in front of the hou&s;e, the infantry marched round the hou&s;e, and the captain, with the leading file, came in at the upper gate. I had a great deal of conver&s;ation with different per&s;ons among them, who &s;eem|ed to take a lead. They were all &s;trangers to me, I told them the con&s;e|quences of their attempting to re&s;cue the pri&s;oners; I told them they might re&s;t a&s;&s;ured that things of this kind would be &s;everely puni&s;hed by the government; that it would be con&s;idered an high offence, and that every in&s;ult offered to me, would be an in&s;ult to the United States. I had a good deal of conver&s;ation with the pri&s;oner at the bar, without knowing that he was captain Fries, till he made him&s;elf known to me. I remon&s;trated &s;trongly again&s;t the mea&s;ures, and told them the con&s;equence, but they &s;eemed regardle&s;s of it, and &s;eemed determined that I &s;hould give them up.</P>

<P>Did he give any rea&s;on for wi&s;hing to re&s;cue tho&s;e pri&s;on|ers?</P>

<SP>
<P>His rea&s;on was, that he was oppo&s;ed to tho&s;e laws: the Alien law, the &s;tamp act, and the hou&s;e tax law, and &s;aid they were uncon&s;titutional. He al&s;o &s;poke of bringing people charged with crimes to Philadelphia to be tried as an oppre&s;&s;ive thing: they had no objection, he &s;aid, to be tried in their own courts, and by their own people. We parted, and met in the croud two or three times, for the hou&s;e was much crouded: he &s;till demanded of me the pri&s;oners, I told him I could not give them up: I told him I was commanded to bring them to Philadelphia: he in&s;i&s;ted upon having them, and I that he &s;hould not. He then went and talked to his people, and came to me again. He told me that if I did not give them up, he would not an&s;wer for the con&s;equences: he told me that he would not hurt me: he was the olde&s;t captain in the rank, but he would not an&s;wer for them that were with me: that he took command of the whole by rank. By this time captain Jarrett came in, and by this time there was much noi&s;e and huzzaing. I was told that this noi&s;e was on ac|count of the arrival of captain Jarrett: I wi&s;hed him pointed out to me in confidence, that, as he had come to &s;ubmit to the laws, he would be able to per&s;uade others to do the &s;ame. He was to me; he had a pair of pi&s;tols in his hand. He &s;hewed me that he had entered into re|cognizance for his appearance. I then begged him to u&s;e his influence in per&s;uading the people to di&s;per&s;e, and go to their re&s;pective homes, and told him what would be the con&s;equence if they did not. His an&s;wer was, that he had no influence; that he could do nothing. After this, I con&s;ulted with judge Henry and others, what was be&s;t to be done; it &s;eemed to be their opinion that I had better &s;ubmit, and give up the pri|&s;oners: I told them I would not do it, I would immediately march the pri&s;oners to Philadelphia, and if the armed mob thought proper to take them from me, they might, it would then be their act, and not mine: I went to them, and told them to prepare for march immediately, for that we would &s;et off to Philadelphia. The Lehi pri&s;oners &s;aid they would not do &s;o, they would not expo&s;e them&s;elves to &s;o much danger, but if I would &s;uffer them to go to their homes, they would meet me in Philadelphia on the Monday or Tue&s;day following. I met Mr. Fries about the foot of the &s;tairs, and he &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in his demand of the pri&s;oners, that I mu&s;t give them up.</P>

<P>When I was at Bethlehem, which I expect was the 7th of March, the fir&s;t I &s;aw was that the company was ordered in rank, and when that was done, this Fries was in the entry of the hou&s;e, where he was &s;peaking loud. I enquired who that was, they &s;aid it was captain Fries; He &s;aid them who was the greate&s;t tories in the la&s;t war, them was the head leaders now; then I went out of the hou&s;e, and he went up to the mar&s;hal, and when he came out again; he went up to his company, and told them " Well brothers, I went up to the mar&s;hal, and a&s;ked him about the pri|&s;oners, and told him I would have the pri&s;oners, but the mar&s;hal told me he dare not give them up willingly; I tell you, brothers, we have to pa&s;s four or five centries, but I beg you not to fire fir&s;t on them, till they fir&s;t fire upon us: I &s;hall be the forema&s;t man; I &s;hall go on before you, and I expect I &s;hall get the fir&s;t blow." Then he turned him&s;elf round. Mr. Mulhollan, and others begged him that he would not go on in this matter, they would rather go and &s;peak to the mar&s;hal that he &s;hould deliver up the pri&s;oners willingly, if they would ab&s;olutely have them.</P>

I did not wait till the pri&s;oners were re|lea&s;ed, for when I heard this, I thought there was going to be warm work, &s;o I got upon my hor&s;e, and rode off to Ea&s;ton as fa&s;t as I could.</P>

<SPEAKER>WITNESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I live in Bethlehem; am a ju&s;tice of the peace there, and was there on the 7th of March.&mdash;Shortly before the la&s;t general election, the &s;pirit of di&s;content and oppo&s;ition was &s;en&s;ibly felt in the county of Northampton; there were different meetings called in different parts of the county, among others, I was informed there was one at which the militia officers were particularly to attend, which I under&s;tood was intended to prepare a ticket for the election. At that meeting, &s;undry re&s;olutions were pa&s;&s;ed, which appeared in public prints, among others, one was that petitions &s;hould be formed to obtain a repeal of the alien
<PB N="42" REF="037104_0046_100D7EA021A893C0">
and &s;edition laws, and the land tax act. I was informed that the cap|tains of the militia companies were to be &s;erved with a copy of each of the&s;e petitions: I was likewi&s;e informed that this was done, and a five penny bit each paid freely for a copy, though the Germans love their money &s;o well. I think the people were told that the petitions merely contained a reque&s;t for the repeal of the hou&s;e and land tax law. I have &s;een none of them. On the election day, the people pretty generally collected and, at lea&s;t in the di&s;trict where I had a right to vote, the &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition again&s;t the mea&s;ures of government were &s;o univer&s;al, that a friend of government, by &s;aying one word in favour of it, was ready to be abu&s;ed and I under&s;tood it was &s;o in every election di&s;trict in the county, and the county in general gloried that they had gained the day. Nothing mate|rial occurred, to my knowledge, from that time till the mar&s;hal arrived there.</P>

I having &s;ome per&s;onal acquaintance with that gentleman, waited on him, when he told me he was &s;ent to the county on bu&s;ine&s;s for the United States, and de&s;ired me to inform him where &s;everal certain per&s;ons re&s;ided, again&s;t whom he had precepts from the di&s;trict judge. I acquainted him with the cour&s;es and di&s;tances. He then went to Nazareth, and returned again about the fifth, telling me he had &s;ummoned a number of per&s;ons in Lehi town&s;hip, and that they were to be at Bethlehem on the 7th. On the 6th in the evening, I was in|formed he had returned from Millar's town, and on the 7th in the morn|ing I went up to town, when he told me that he expected there would be &s;ome di&s;turbance that day, and al&s;o told me that he had i&s;&s;ued &s;ummons's for <HI>the posse commitatus.</HI> Between 10 and 11 o'clock the po&s;&s;e came, I think they were about 14 in number. A con&s;iderable number of people from the neighbourhoood of Bethlehem, had collected, unarmed. Mr. Dixon arrived from Emaus about 11 o'clock, and informed the mar&s;hal that on his way he met with a number of people collected at a tavern called Reiter's, in arms, both hor&s;emen and footmen, about 6 miles from Bethlehem, and that he met a number on the road, partly armed, partly unarmed. About half pa&s;t eleven, two men arrived at Bethlehem armed, from that quarter: they were di&s;armed and &s;ent up &s;tairs into a room; about the &s;ame time a number of per&s;ons arrived from Lehi town&s;hip, who were al&s;o &s;ent up &s;tairs by the mar&s;hal in a room by them&s;elves: they were about eleven in number. I was pre&s;ent when Mr. Eyerly &s;poke to the&s;e pri&s;oners, telling them that an armed force was formed with intention to re&s;cue them; the pri&s;oners an&s;wered that they by no means wi&s;hed it: that they would &s;ubmit to go with the mar&s;hal rather than be re&s;cued. In about an hour, I was looking out of the window up &s;tairs, and &s;aw riding into the yard a number of hor&s;emen, be&s;ides &s;ome footmen; 1 &s;aid to the mar&s;hal, I thought it was be&s;t for us now to go down and
<PB N="43" REF="037104_0047_100D7EA1A5706D48">
&s;ee the&s;e people. I went down and a&s;ked one of them what was his name, he an&s;wered Daniel Shaeffer. He had a &s;word at his &s;ide, and two pi&s;tols: next to him, on hor&s;eback, was Henry Shankwyler, next to him was another hor&s;eman accoutred in the &s;ame manner; his name was Phi|lip Dae&s;ch; there were al&s;o John Dillinger and Jacob Kline, not in uni|form but with &s;words in the &s;cabbard. I a&s;ked them what they wanted: we are all civil people and have no arms, was my ob&s;ervation to them. Dillinger who &s;eemed to &s;peak for them, &s;aid that ye&s;terday the mar&s;hal had taken Shankwyler and &s;ome other of their neighbours pri&s;oners, that they were come to &s;ee Shankwyler's partner (accu&s;er.) The mar&s;hal told them that the United States was the accu&s;er of Mr. Shankwyler. Dillin|ger &s;aid he thought it was not right that he &s;hould be taken to Philadel|phia. The mar&s;hal &s;aid that the judge had ordered it &s;o. I told him that I thought they were unacquainted with the government of the Uni|ted States, and 1 thought they were in a very critical and dangerous &s;itu|ation; that the United States in le&s;s than 20 days could mu&s;ter 10,000 men, which power I thought they could not with &s;tand, and that it was be&s;t for them to &s;urrender the pri&s;oners to the mar&s;hal, and go home. They &s;aid that Shankwyler and the others were their neighbours, and that they would wait and &s;ee what &s;hould become of them. They did not mention the others names. I a&s;ked whether any more armed men would be there; Jacob Kline an&s;wered, 50 more. With that we went into the hou&s;e. After dinner the people collected very fa&s;t, and Dillinger began again to &s;peak in behalf of Shankwyler. The mar&s;hal told him it could not be otherwi&s;e, go he mu&s;t: Shankwyler an&s;wered that he had a family to take care of, and that he would not go. With this, the mar|&s;hal and my&s;elf walked up &s;tairs, and there &s;aw a great number of armed people round the hou&s;e, 1 think 120 or 130, and about 250 unarmed. I &s;ugge&s;ted to the mar&s;hal that my &s;u&s;picions were very gloomy; that I doubted whether he would &s;ucceed in taking off the pri&s;oners, for I had quietly heard among the people that were in the hou&s;e, and out of doors, that nothing &s;hould &s;atisfy them but the delivery of the pri&s;oners in front of the hou&s;e was drawn up a number of men armed. I went up &s;tairs and there I perceived &s;everal times, guns pointed up to the window of the &s;econd &s;tory at which I began to feel very di&s;agreeable. Mr. Ey|erly, Mr. Balliott, Mr. Henry, and the others were occa&s;ionly at the windows, though I do not recollect Eyerly being at the window, but the others were: I walked down &s;tairs, and there &s;aw men armed clo&s;e before the door, pre&s;&s;ing in: I pre&s;&s;ed through them, and heard two men &s;ay if Henry, and that damned Eyerly, and that damned pot gutted Balliott were there, they would tear them to pieces; this man did not attempt to come into the hou&s;e. I thought this was bad news, and I walked back again, and proceeded my way up &s;tairs, and de&s;ired Mr. Levering (the tavern keeper to clo&s;e the bar) thinking there was madne&s;s enough with|out &s;timulating it, which was immediately done. I de&s;ired the mar&s;hal not to protract the delivery of the pri&s;oners to the law. Mr. Mohollan and &s;everal others there pu&s;hed them back, but ju&s;t then I heard &s;ome of the officers &s;ay, "boys, in the ranks, in the ranks."</P>

<P>NO, they &s;taid in the yard.&mdash;I looked out of the window again up &s;tairs, and there I &s;aw a &s;econd pre&s;&s;ure, to come in at the door &s;ome of the men who were in the ranks thumped their guns upon the ground, and jumped, pronouncing &s;ome unintelligible &s;hrieks, &s;avage like &s;hrieks. I begged the mar&s;hal, for God's &s;ake to deliver up tho&s;e men up &s;tairs, for the re&s;cue was perfect in my opinion: the clo&s;ing of the men would be only butchering, and I had no doubt the government of the United States would not let its dignity be trampled upon in this way. The mar&s;hal &s;till continued to he&s;&s;itate. By this time a number of per|&s;ons had got into the hou&s;e, adorned with large three coloured French cockades. The po&s;&s;e &s;taid up &s;tairs at this time: I then worked my way down &s;tairs again, in order to be ready for a jump. By this time I un|der&s;tood that the pri&s;oners were delivered. After the pri&s;oners were gone about ten minutes, there was not a &s;ingle armed man in, or about the hou&s;e: &s;ome of the neighbours who had collected were &s;till there, &s;ome of whom were approving, and others di&s;approving of the conduct of the in&s;urgents, but in my opinion, the majority were approving.</P>

<SP>
<P>No, not to my knowledge, if I had I &s;hould not have known him, for I never heard of him before. Having met with tho&s;e hor&s;e men before we came back to the bridge, we returned with them, and all made an halt in the yard. I &s;poke all I could to di&s;&s;uade them from the purpo&s;e about which they came, but all to no purpo&s;e. I had no an&s;wer that I could under&s;tand, for they generally &s;poke in German or broken Engli&s;h, which I could not under&s;tand. I always under&s;tood, generally, that they wanted the pri&s;oners, and that they wi&s;hed to give in &s;ecurity, and let them be tried in the county: that if they had done any thing that was wrong, it was right they &s;hould &s;uffer, but that it was not right to take them to Philadelphia. I heard major Barnett &s;ay this who interpreted what they &s;aid in German. After being a con&s;iderable time engaged with people as actively as I could, but it appeared to be but to little purpo&s;e, I then went up &s;tairs with a view to take &s;omething; as I was returning the &s;tairs were &s;o crouded I could not ea&s;ily get down. Coming down I &s;aw a per|&s;on whom I under&s;tood to be captain Fries, and the mar&s;hal &s;tanding talk|ing to him. I believe it was the pri&s;oner at the bar. I heard them talk a few words: the mar&s;hal &s;aid that they were not doing right, and they mu&s;t &s;uffer: but I cannot recollect any thing particularly that was &s;aid, but I ob&s;erved that he often made a demand of the pri&s;oners, but that he &s;hould not be hurt; that he would be an&s;werable for him&s;elf and the company, that none of his men &s;hould hurt him that day, but that he would not be an&s;werable for any others that did not belong to his com|pany. I think he repeated this twice. I was there but a few minutes. I made &s;ome ob&s;ervations to the men advi&s;ing them to con&s;ider what they were about, for I con&s;idered it dangerous, and very wrong to proceed in this way. At this time there was a noi&s;e in the entry: I was afraid &s;omething had happened, &s;o I went down, but I do not recollect &s;eeing Fries, the whole day afterwards. There was a great deal &s;aid, but none of them &s;poke to me in Engli&s;h.</P>

<P>AS to what happened on the &s;eventh of March, I am not able to &s;ay much. I was out with the mar&s;hal the day before, when he &s;erved the proce&s;s. As we heard that the re&s;cue was intended. It was agreed by the mar&s;hal to &s;end expre&s;s to Ea&s;ton, in order to obtain the po&s;&s;e to aid him in the execution of his duty: they accordingly arrived between 10 and 11 o'clock, to the number of 15 or 16. Mr. Dixon of Emaus told us that he had &s;een about 20 armed men at Reiter's tavern, and &s;ome at another tavern, be&s;ides &s;ome on the road, and that he under&s;tood from them that they were coming to re&s;cue the pri&s;oners. It was then agreed to take the&s;e pri&s;oners, who had &s;urrendered, up &s;tairs. There were a number of people now collected now from the neighbourhood, and then it was agreed to &s;end the deputation to meet the armed men. About that time I went down &s;tairs into the back room, and there I &s;aw tho&s;e two men who&s;e arms had been taken from them; I did not &s;ee them come in.
<PB N="46" REF="037104_0050_100D7EA6D7B41D80">
I then went up &s;tairs again, this was the la&s;t time I went down &s;tairs, till after the pri&s;oners were relea&s;ed. I then &s;aw tho&s;e three men come with Shankwyler. I did not hear what pa&s;&s;ed, but &s;aw Mr. Hor&s;efield and judge Henry go to them. Sometime afterwards, I &s;aw an armed force coming in, a great many on hor&s;eback, and many footmen with mu&s;kets on their &s;houlders: the hor&s;emen had their &s;words drawn. The greate&s;t part of tho&s;e on hor&s;eback came from Bucks county. Afterwards, the mar&s;hal came up &s;tairs and &s;aid that they were determined to have the pri&s;oners, and he believed that Mr. Balliott and my&s;elf would be in danger of our lives if we went out of the hou&s;e, and then de&s;ired me to undertake to guard the &s;tairs, and told me to give orders that if any body would come up with force, they &s;hould &s;hoot them. I placed the guard on the &s;tairs, at fir&s;t there was but two. Some of the po&s;&s;e were at this time below talking to the people. After &s;ome time the guard told me that they got &s;o violent, and threatened to come up &s;tairs with violence, and reque&s;ted of me that I might double the guard, which I did. As I was in the room. I looked out of the window and &s;aw a company of rifle men, all with three coloured cockades, marching Indian file round the hou&s;e: I counted them, there were 42 in that company: another per&s;on be&s;ides my&s;elf was counting them, but I do not recollect who it was, though I rather think it was Mr. Balliott: they marched twice round the hou&s;e. Another time when I was walking about the room a per&s;on who was along with me, I do not recollect who, told me that they were pointing their guns up to the window, and that he was &s;ure it was dangerous for me to &s;how my&s;elf at the window.</P>

<SPEAKER>WITNESS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, as much as po&s;&s;ible. There was nothing particular that I &s;aw, except at one time when I was in the room, I heard a terrible huzza: this was in the afternoon. On this I went to the window to &s;ee what produced this noi&s;e, and I &s;aw that captain Jarrett had arrived: the had ju&s;t di&s;mounted his hor&s;e, and had his pi&s;tols, in his hand, and was walking up toward the &s;tairs. I did not remain long at the window, but ju&s;t looked out, and &s;aw him come in, and &s;hortly after he came up into the room where I was; he had not his pi&s;tols with him then: I had that moment received a letter from Mr. Rawle, attorney of the di&s;trict, that Mr. Jarrett had &s;urrendered him&s;elf and given bail, and that he declared he was a &s;trong friend to government. I then &s;aid to him, if you are a friend to government, as you profe&s;s to be, you ought to go down and tell
<PB N="47" REF="037104_0051_100D7EA9AB90D500">
your people to de&s;i&s;t: to which he made no reply at all. He walked about in the room for &s;ome time, and then wept down &s;tairs. I did not &s;ee any thing more till the pri&s;oners were relea&s;ed. The only time I &s;aw Mr. Fries, the pri&s;oner, was a few minutes before the pri&s;oners were delivered up. I walked our of the room and &s;aw Mr. Fries upon the head of the &s;tairs, &s;peaking with the mar&s;hal: &s;hortly after, the pri&s;oners were reque&s;t|ed to go down, but the mini&s;ter &s;taying a little while up in the room, there was a call made for him particularly, and therefore I went and re|que&s;ted him to go down. Shortly after, the armed men went off. I look|ed out of the window and &s;aw Mr. Jarrett parading his light hor&s;e in rank before the door. He then gave orders to march, and they went off.</P>

<P>After I had received my commi&s;&s;ion, which was &s;ometime in Augu&s;t 1798, I had received a letter from the &s;ecretary of the trea&s;ury, reque&s;ting me to take &s;ome pains to find out &s;uitable characters to &s;erve at a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. I did, in con&s;equence of that, write &s;ome letters to &s;ome of my friends, in the counties of Northampton, Luzerne and Wayne, which con&s;tituted my divi&s;ion: in Wayne and Luzerne, I found no difficulties whatever, but received a number of applications &s;ufficient, and accompanied with recom|mendations. In Northampton county I was not &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful; I had but two recommendations from that county; it was therefore nece&s;&s;ary for me, from the be&s;t information which I could obtain, to endeavour to find men of &s;uitable characters in each town&s;hip; and likewi&s;e to get a num|ber of blank commi&s;&s;ions, in ca&s;e &s;ome of tho&s;e appointed &s;hould refu&s;e to accept of the office. I received information at Reading, at the time the board of commi&s;&s;ioners met, from the commi&s;&s;ioner in Bucks, that he had received information from a gentlemen in Philadelphia (Mr. Chapman) that he had travelled through a great part of Northampton county, and that in every tavern where he &s;topped, this tax law was the general topic of conver&s;ation, and that great pains was taken to find out who the per|&s;ons were that were friends of the government &s;o much as to be a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, in order to per&s;uade them not to accept of the appointment. Although I could not believe it was the ca&s;e at that time, yet I found it was the ca&s;e afterwards.</P>

I &s;ent them their commi&s;&s;ions, and with them notices to meet me at a time and place appointed in order to receive from me their in&s;tructions.</P>

<P>I appointed a meeting of the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the third di&s;trict at Nazareth, on the 3d Thur&s;day in November, two of them did not attend, and &s;ome of the others who did attend begged to be excu&s;ed from &s;erving. I a&s;ked their rea&s;on, and told them I could not very well excu&s;e them, they told me that the people in their different town&s;hips were very much oppo&s;ed to the law; that they thought it was dangerous for them to accept of it. I found that they, as well as the people, had a wrong idea about the law; and I was &s;o happy that day as to prevail upon all tho&s;e that wi&s;hed to be excu&s;ed accepting the appointment, upon explaining the law to them, to accept it. The next day I met the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the &s;econd di&s;trict at Al|lentown, where all attended but one. I had the &s;ame difficulty there as at the other place, and it was not without much difficulty that tho&s;e who did appear, that they did accept of the appointment. I then left the blank commi&s;&s;ions with Mr. Balliot, and reque&s;ted him to appoint &s;ome per&s;ons in the room of Mr. Home, who had refu&s;ed. The Monday fol|lowing met the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the other di&s;trict at Che&s;nut Hill town&s;hip. Previous to that I had &s;een Mr. Kearne, who was the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, appointed at Ea&s;ton; when I mentioned to him that he was appointed an a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, he told me that it would not &s;uit him to accept of it. I reque&s;ted of him that he might name &s;ome &s;uitable per&s;on, and qualified for it, and I would be willing to accept him. He mentioned Jacob Snyder, and told me he would notice Mr. Snyder to meet me with the re&s;t. When I came there two of the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors did not appear, and one from Hamilton did not appear willing to accept of it, but after a great deal of explaining and per&s;uading, it was prevailed upon. Ju&s;t as we were going, Synder came, he told me that be had received his notice, and that he was not willing to accept it; that the people were very much oppo&s;ed to the law, and he did not very well under&s;tand it him&s;elf, but he thought he would endeavour to get &s;ome information, and that when he came there, the information he received was &s;uch, that he was determined to go after me, and accept of the ap|pointment, if he were to ride 50 miles in order to accept of it, for that he had been wrong informed about the law. I then went up to Wayne county where I had no difficulty, except that one a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or told me that he was per&s;uaded with difficulty to accept of the appointment. As I was going to Luzerne county, the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or from Hamilton town&s;hip, (Nicholas Michael) came after me, and told me that he had been obliged to fly from his hou&s;e in the night to &s;ave his life, and begged of me to accept of his re&s;ignation; I told him I could not accept of it, but that I would &s;ee per|fect ju&s;tice done. At any reque&s;t he went with mo to Ea&s;ton, where we went to &s;ee for Mr. Sitgreaves, attorney of the di&s;trict, but not finding him at home, we went to Judge Trail, in order to take his depo&s;ition. He begged that I would grant the favour for him to con&s;ider of it till the next morning; I did, and next morning he came to me and begged me " Mr. Eyerly, for God's &s;ake put me to jail, &s;o that I may be &s;ecure of my life, for if I inform again&s;t the&s;e people, I and my family &s;hall be ruined. I told him that I would do no &s;uch thing, for that I had too much friend&s;hip for him; that I would give a few lines to the con&s;table to reque&s;t him to call a town&s;hip meeting, and I would meet him in the town|&s;hip. I reque&s;ted Mr. Henry to go there with me: I had rea&s;on to be|lieve that this oppo&s;ition aro&s;e from mi&s;repre&s;entation, which I &s;uppo&s;ed was given to the people by a few gentlemen, who had travelled through

the county a few days &s;ince. When we came to Hamilton town&s;hip, there were about 60 or 70 per&s;ons a&s;&s;embled, three or four of them in uniforms, their arms was behind the door at the hou&s;e of Mr. Hellers. I then told them that I was come as their friend, and without any de&s;ign of taking the lea&s;t advantage of their conduct in oppo&s;ing the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors: that I had come to read the law to them, and explain it. I did &s;o, and pointed out the impo&s;itions practi&s;ed on them. Mr. Henry a&s;&s;i&s;ted me as much as he could, but all to very little purpo&s;e. The a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or after this again begged me, for God's &s;ake, to accept of his re&s;ignation. AS there was a number of them that complained again&s;t the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. I propo&s;ed to them that though I had no authority to it, yet if I thought it would be a favour to grant them that indulgence to elect their own a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or them&s;elves, I would grant him the appointment. They told me they would do no &s;uch thing, for &s;aid they " if we do this, we at once acknowledge that we will &s;ubmit to the laws, and that is what we wont do. I then enquired for a &s;uitable man, and John Hu&s;ton was mentioned, who was likewi&s;e elected a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or under the county rates. I called him into a room, and reque&s;ted him to accept the appointment, he told me it was im|po&s;&s;ible at the pre&s;ent time, but he &s;hould, whenever things appeared more favourable, &s;o that he could go through, be willing to do it.</P>

<P>The la&s;t week in December, or the fir&s;t of January I re|ceived a letter from Mr. Heckavelter, the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of upper Milford: by which, he informed me that he was &s;topped, by a regular deputation from the town&s;hip meeting, con&s;i&s;ting of 3 men. I &s;ent a line to Mr. Heck|avelter, and wi&s;hed him to give notice to Mr. Schymer, Mr. Moretz, and &s;ome of the leading men in the town&s;hip, that I would meet them at &s;uch a time, and explain the bu&s;ine&s;s to them. When I came, in con&s;e|quence, within 4 miles of the place, I was reque&s;ted by a friend, not to go, for that the people, were &s;o violent, that if I did go I &s;hould certainly be killed: I replied to them that I would go, I was not afraid of any of them. I took Mr. Henry along with me; when we came there, I found about 60 or 70 per&s;ons collected at the hou&s;e of John Schymer. I &s;uppo&s;e a|bout 20 of them had French cockades in their hats, red, blue and white. Mr. Schymer then took me into his own room; there were about eight or ten in the room. Mr. Schymer a&s;ked me if I had &s;een the petitions, he gave one of them to me, and reque&s;ted that I would read it, which I did in the pre&s;ence of another per&s;on; there were but two in the company that under&s;tood Engli&s;h. While I was reading, the&s;e two men began to &s;hake their heads, they &s;aid it was not &s;uch a petition as they had been told. I then a&s;ked them whether the general oppo&s;ition was not on account of the &s;tamp tax, and the hou&s;e tax; they &s;aid yes. I then told them there was not a word in this petition again&s;t the &s;tamp act; they &s;eemed to be al|together &s;atisfied, and &s;aid that they had been made to believe it was. I then went into the next room, where the people collected: &s;ome of them appeared to be extremely violent and very abu&s;ive. I told them I had not came there to be abu&s;ed by any body; that I had come there as a friend, to inform them of the law which it was important &s;hould be under&s;tood. There was a report among them that it was no law; I read the law to them, and explained it in the German language, and told them it was their
<PB N="50" REF="037104_0054_100D7EB1B314DFB0">
duty to &s;ubmit to it. One of them of the name of George Shaeffer jumped up before me, and &s;aid, Mr. Eyerly, it is no law; I told them that if they did not believe me, they might enquire of Squire Schymer whether it was or not. Mr. Schymer told them it was a law; upon which Shaef|fer replied, " admitting it is a law, we will not &s;ubmit to it". He then farther &s;aid, here I am, take me to gaol, but you &s;hall &s;ee how far you will bring me. Upon which a great many of them jumped up and &s;aid, yes by God, if they &s;hall only attempt to take any one to jail, we would &s;oon have him out again. Some of them made u&s;e of very abu&s;ive language again&s;t the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, calling him a tory ra&s;cal and the like; and as the a&s;&s;|e&s;&s;or had reque&s;ted me to accept of his re&s;ignation becau&s;e it was not in his power to go through with it, I propo&s;ed to them, that if they had any objections again&s;t the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, that they &s;hould elect one, and I would give him his appointment; to which &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible and mo&s;t mode|rate replied, no, if it mu&s;t be done Mr. Heckavelter &s;hall do it, and &s;ome of the others &s;aid, we will do no &s;uch things if we do, we at once acknow|ledge that we &s;ubmit to the law, and that is what we will not. I then went over to the tavern clo&s;e by, with Mr. Schymer, when Mr. Hecka|velter came to me, and told me that he was in danger; that there was three of the Shaeffers were going to give him a licking: I reque&s;ted him to &s;tand by me, and I would &s;ee him &s;afe. We then went off.</P>

<P>It was not executed there, nor at upper Milford till about two or three weeks ago at farthe&s;t. I then agreed to go to Millars town, where one of the Shaeffer's lived.

<P>&mdash;In Penn town&s;hip the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or did not meet us, he refu&s;ed to accept the appointment, well aware of the difficulties that would occur, and a general rule was admitted to meet tho&s;e difficulties. I received information from Mr. Balliott that he had found a man in that town&s;hip who was willing to execute the office. At my reque&s;t, he &s;ent him a commi&s;&s;ion, but the man was obliged, before he took the oaths, to return it again, declaring it was impo&s;&s;ible to do it. This was &s;ometime in Ja|nuary. Sometime afterwards he wrote to me of another man who would accept. I reque&s;ted him to &s;ign his commi&s;&s;ion. I received information while the mar&s;hal, Mr. Balliott and my&s;elf were about the county, that as &s;oon as the people, in the town&s;hip knew that he had received his com|mi&s;&s;ion they rai&s;ed a mob.</P>

<P>Yes.&mdash;He called us ra&s;cals, highway robbers and the like: the mar&s;hal told him he only had a &s;ubpoena to appear at Philadelphia to give te&s;timony; to which he an&s;wered, in German, he would be damned if he would go. The mar&s;hal finding he could do nothing with him, re|que&s;ted Daniel Schwartz &s;en. to read and explain it to him, and we left it with him to &s;erve. We then went to Millars town to &s;erve a warrant on George Schaeffer, but we were told he was gone to Philadelphia: we went to Seward's tavern. The mar&s;hal and my&s;elf then went to Shank|wyler's where there was at lea&s;t 50 a&s;&s;embled in the room. Not knowing Shankwyler, Mr. Balliott pointed him out, and the mar&s;hal took him: while the mar&s;hal was talking with Shankwyler, the croud inclo&s;ed upon us, and abu&s;ed us very much, and in a very menacing manner, accompa|nied with an almo&s;t univer&s;al cry of &s;trike, &s;trike, &s;trike, &s;o that for &s;ome time we did nor know what would be the con&s;equence. The mar&s;hal this time was per&s;uading Shankwyler to &s;ubmit, telling him the con&s;e|quence of oppo&s;ition: he at fir&s;t declared he would not, but at length he &s;aid he would do as Jarret did. Some of the people then &s;aid, that if Shank|wyler was to be taken out of his hou&s;e, they would fight as long as they had of drop of blood in their bodies. The mar&s;hal then turned round to the croud, when they were &s;o violent, and told them that Mr. Balliott and my&s;elf were under his protection. I forgot to mention that while the mar&s;hal was talking to Shankwyler in the bar, one of the per&s;ons pre|&s;ent tore the cockade from Mr. Balliott's hat, while he was turning round to &s;peak to the mar&s;hal: Mr. Balliott did not for the pre&s;ent know but it was a blow &s;ome one had given him. They then made back a little. Having found it impo&s;&s;ible to do any thing farther, Shankwyler promi&s;ed to meet the mar&s;hal at Bethlehem. We then went out of the room, but before we came out of the hou&s;e there was a terrible huzza in the room. I then &s;ent for a con&s;table at the reque&s;t of the mar&s;hal, to go with him and &s;how him the per&s;ons and places of tho&s;e again&s;t whom he had pro|ce&s;s. I remained while he &s;erved the proce&s;s' at Mr. Irexler's, and it was there we fir&s;t received information that an attempt would be made the next day to re&s;cue the pri&s;oners. We arrived at Bethlehem that evening the 6th of March, and then the occurrences happened of which I have given te&s;timony as far as I know.</P>

They had no officer with them. Stahlnaker was one of the lieutenants, but did not meddle with the com|pany, nor was he in regimentals, nor in arms. They waited about two hours for Fogle, the fir&s;t lieutenant, but he did not come. Captain Jar|rett was down at Philadelphia. When I found there was no one to take the command, I determined to go no farther: then there began a quarrel among them, &s;ome of them were willing to go, and &s;ome of them were not. Stahlnaker and my&s;elf then propo&s;ed to go to Bethlehem, and we would bring them advice what was doing there, if they would wait an hour, and then they would know what was be&s;t to do. I then took off my regimentals, and put others on, belonging to my brother-in-law, the tavern-keeper. Some were willing to do this, &s;ome were not. They then went after me, and told me that I mu&s;t put on my regimentals, and take my trumpet. I refu&s;ed this, and told them, I would not go a &s;tep farther unle&s;s there was &s;ome officer who would' take the command and an&s;wer for it.

They then reque&s;ted me to go over as one of the deputies with two others: one of them was Yie&s;ly, a rifle man. I agreed to go, provided they would re|main there till we returned.

&s;aid that Shankwyler never owned a pair of pi&s;tols, nor did they believe any were ever there except a traveller brought them there.

Staeler an&s;wered, yes, and that he was to be the fol|lowing day at Bethlehem, and a&s;ked me whether I would go to Bethlehem likewi&s;e, and told me that more people were going up to &s;ee, I &s;aid I &s;hould al&s;o like to go and &s;ee, provided the people would &s;ave them&s;elves from getting into trouble.

Whereupon, he (Staeler) de&s;ired me to tell young Marks that the light hor&s;e were going to Bethlehem, and that he &s;hould go likewi&s;e if he plea&s;ed.

</SP>
<SP>
<P>There was when we were at Quaker town.&mdash;We all &s;tood in a rank, and fired off, and hallowed huzza. One party went to Enoch Roberts's tavern, and the other to David Zeller's, and &s;oon after we were there, the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors came along. They were e&s;quire Foulke, John Rodrick, and Cephas Childs. I was at Zeller's when they came along, and they all began to run out of the tavern. When I came out they had Foulke by his hor&s;e's bridle, and him by one leg, and they told him to get off. It was captain Kouder that had hold of him; then John Fries came up and told him to get off. Jacob Hoover came up, I think before Fries, and tol Kouder to go away and not abu&s;e the man, and he took hold of the bridle and &s;poke to him. Fries told Foulke to get off, he wanted to &s;peak to him. Then George Mumbower came up, and &s;tood at the back of the others, giving one of them a knock with the butt of his gun, and told them to pull him of; Jacob and John Hoover told them they &s;hould not abu&s;e the man, for he would get off without. With that the e&s;quire rode up with them to the &s;hed, and got off. They then went into the tavern together. Then John Fries told him that he had forewarned them ye&s;|terday not to a&s;&s;e&s;s the hou&s;es, and yet they had come to day again; he then told him that he &s;hould &s;how his writings, what he had done in the town&s;hip. Which he did, and John Fries read them, and gave them to him back again. I then went into another room, and when I came out again, Childs, the other a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, was &s;itting on the table, with five or &s;ix about him. When I came up to him, I told him that they &s;hould not abu&s;e him, for I u&s;ed to know him: at this time they were abu&s;ing him?</P>

Then we went down to Jacob Fries's, and there captain Kouder told me that I &s;hould be at Marks' the next day, to go along with them to Millar's town. It was now dark, and I had not &s;een John Fries come then. He told the &s;ame to the re&s;t of the company. I then went home and went to bed. After I was home about a quarter of an hour, John Gettman and John Fries's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> came to our hou&s;e, but I was in bed.

<P>What was the &s;ub&s;tance of the conver&s;ation before you went from the tavern?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>Why, that they were going to Millar's town: I did not know that they were going to Bethlehem.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>Did you hear any conver&s;ation about the intention of the march?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>Yes. That we were going to Millar's town, for &s;hould there be pri|&s;oners there, Marks &s;aid that he wanted us to &s;how our&s;elves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>What were you to &s;how your&s;elves for?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<P>Were you to a&s;&s;i&s;t to bring the pri&s;oners down to Philadelphia?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>I do not know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>What was the intention of the Northampton people?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>Why, they had a mind to take the pri&s;oners again: I under&s;tood that the night before at Fries's and along the road before we got there. About three or four miles from old Marks', we met young Marks; he &s;aid it was not worth while to go to Millar's town, that the pri&s;oners were up at Bethlehem, and that they had all gone there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>Who had gone there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>The Northampton people&mdash;the light hor&s;e. Some was then for going back again: &s;ome, as they had come &s;o far, was for going up to Bethle|hem, to &s;ee what was going on there, &s;o we went on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>Who told you to go on?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>Old Marks and John Fries &s;aid that as they were come &s;o far on the road, they would go up and &s;ee what was doing there. Then we went on about a mile, and &s;topped at Ritters where they fed their hor&s;es: there was a liberty pole there. Then we went on to Bethlehem. When we came to the bridge, there the people had &s;topped, there was &s;ome riflemen and &s;ome light hor&s;e. Some a&s;ked the rea&s;on why they &s;topped there: they &s;aid they could not get over, the bridge was &s;hut: then John Fries rode un, and a&s;ked whether they required toll or not; they &s;aid, yes. Then he told them to count his men, and told us to follow him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>Did he &s;peak generally?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>Yes.&mdash;The words he u&s;ed was, now boys, follow me. I do not know whether he counted all or only his own men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>Did you hear any thing at that time of tho&s;e men whom you found there having &s;ent three men to Bethlehem?</P>

<P>I heard of their having taken two or three men under guard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>Who paid the toll?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>I do not know, we did not, we were all mixed together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>Did you not hear of three men being &s;ent forward?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>No, I did not.&mdash;I heard of their having taken &s;ome pri&s;oners.</P>

<SP>
<P>About twenty miles.</P>

<SP>
<P>When we got over the bridge, there were two men met us, and &s;aid we &s;hould not hurt them; Fries told them that he &s;hould hurt nobody without they hurt him fir&s;t. Then Judge Mohollan came and &s;poke with him afterwards, but I do not know what either he, or Fries &s;aid. When we got up to the tavern at Bethlehem, the whole of Staeler's rifle-company were there. They marched round the hou&s;e twice; we did not &s;tand in ranks, we were &s;eparate. They wanted one to go up and talk with the mar&s;hal, and they from Bucks and Northampton &s;aid John Fries was more fit to go up than e'er a man that was there. Then John Fries and one Hoover went up &s;tairs. After a while Hoover came down, Fries &s;taid up when he came down, he kept da&s;hing and &s;wearing, and &s;aid force &s;hould do: give him nine or ten of the be&s;t riflemen in the company, and he would &s;torm the hou&s;e; a great many of them told him he &s;hould not do it, he &s;aid he would, Jacob Hoover, George Mitchel and Mr. Mohollan endeavoured to keep him off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>Did this Hoover belong to Staeler's company?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>I think he did.&mdash;Then Fries, when he came down &s;tairs, he fetched &s;ome writing down with him, that he got from the mar&s;hal, which he read to the company. He &s;aid the mar&s;hal dared not give up the pri&s;on|ers, and therefore that they would take them by force of arms. At this time the Bucks county people were &s;eparate from the others.</P>

Then Fries went up &s;tairs again, and &s;aid he would go and talk to them once more. When he came down again, he &s;aid that the mar&s;hal dared not give them up, without they took them by force of arms. They then told him that he &s;hould go and do &s;omething pretty &s;oon, for it was getting late. Some of them &s;aid it was better to let Fries have the whole command of all the men. Then it was concluded to go into the hou&s;e, and he &s;poke five or &s;ix times.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>Was it agreed that Fries &s;hould have the whole under his command? I do not know. I only heard what that one man &s;aid, and he thought him the fitte&s;t per&s;on.</P>

There was &s;omething in the news paper of an amendment, which made them doubt whether it was in force. They formed an in&s;trument of writing, but I cannot recollect the particulars of it. It was drawn up by John Fries; I a&s;&s;i&s;ted him. We pa&s;&s;ed home after that.

<P> I am not &s;ure: perhaps it was my&s;elf. John Hoover, and &s;everal, had talked about it, and we thought we would call a meeting. Was Fries pre&s;ent when you agreed to call this meeting? No.&mdash;This was on Friday: on the Monday following James Chapman came to my hou&s;e, and told me I &s;hould tell Jacob Hoover that he &s;hould give notice over the creek (I live nearly at the end of the town&s;hip) that if they would choo&s;e an a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of their own, they &s;hould be welcome; and any man that was capable of the bu&s;ine&s;s would be admited into the office. There was one Valentine Hoover came to my hou&s;e that &s;ame day, he lives over the other &s;ide, and I told him what Mr. Chapman had

told me, likewi&s;e, I informed Jacob Hoover that day my&s;elf. Who op|po&s;ed it I dont know, but it was reported that it was not adopted. Squire Foulke &s;ent me word to adverti&s;e a meeting. I&s;rael Roberts and Samuel Clark called on me and told me. They informed me that Mr. Foulke was of opinion that the people were ignorant of the law, and he would read it for them, and explain it to them: this was the purpo&s;e of the meeting. So we adverti&s;ed the meeting to be held at my hou&s;e.</P>

<P>What time was this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>Sometime in February toward the latter end. It was on a Saturday, and there were a great many of the inhabitants at the meeting, &s;quire Foulke and Mr. Chapman attended it. The people behaved very di&s;or|derly; but I cannot recollect any of the conver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed. Jacob Kline came in and a&s;ked me what the meeting was intended for. I told him that I under&s;tood by &s;quire Foulke, that the Germans were very igno|rant of the law, and that he called them together, to read, and explain it to them; I de&s;ired him to try to pacify the people, and I believe he did his endeavour, but it proved in vain: at lea&s;t they did not read the law. I did not under&s;tand. that any body offered to read it, he thought it was in vain, there was &s;uch a clamour.</P>

<SP>
<P>Did they &s;ay any thing to you?</P>

Hear|ing of &s;uch an uproar, I thought I had bu&s;ine&s;s at Millars town. &s;o I con|cluded to go and hear what was going on: they talked they were going to meet the Northampions who were going for the relief of the Pri&s;oners.</P>

Fries went in, I &s;aw him &s;tart to go in, but I did not hear who ordered him, or who de&s;ired him. A &s;hort time after, in the cour&s;e of five or ten minutes, Henry Hoover came out to us, and &s;aid he was &s;ergeant of their company, and he was cho&s;en to demand the pri&s;oners. He &s;aid he went up &s;tairs, and &s;omebody gave him a pu&s;h, and had like to have tumbled him down &s;tairs, and he came out in a great pa&s;&s;ion.

little threatenings. The a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of lower Milford was taken &s;ick &s;oon after he got his in&s;tructions, and &s;o did not proceed. His name was Sa|muel Clark: I called upon him afterwards, to know whether he was able to proceed or not: he thought he &s;hould be able in a few days: I had occa&s;ion to go to Newtown, and was &s;everal days from home, but found there was nothing done re&s;pecting it; I found the people had had a meet|ing, and there appeared to be great oppo&s;ition to the rates being taken. The day after I returned from Newtown, Clark called upon me, and told me he thought it was not &s;afe to go about, from the di&s;po&s;ition of the people at that time. I told him that I would meet him the next day at George Mitchel's tavern in Milford, and meet the people to know what their complaints were. I met Clark at a hou&s;e ju&s;t by, and he told me he would be in at Mitchell in a few minutes. I examined Mitchel, to know what was their complaints: Mitchel &s;ignified that the people were di&s;&s;a|tisfied that the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or was appointed without their having a choice: for they wi&s;hed to choo&s;e for them&s;elves. I told Mitchel if they would choo&s;e, a man of character, I would u&s;e my influence with the commi&s;&s;ioner to have him appointed, and I de&s;ired him to give notice of it to Jacob Hoo|ver.

<P>I do not recollect that it was.&mdash;I met him at a meeting of the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors which was held at the hou&s;e of John Rodruck. On my return home I was told, I think by '&s;quire Foulke, that the town&s;hip was adverti&s;ed to meet at Mitchel's. He &s;aid if I would attend there he would meet me. I got there between one and two clock, Ju&s;t as I got to the hou&s;e, be|fore I went in, I &s;aw ten or twelve people coming from towards Hoover's mill, about half of them were armed, and the others with &s;ticks. I went into the hou&s;e, and twenty or thirty were there. I &s;at talking with &s;ome of my acquaintance that were well di&s;po&s;ed to the law. Conrad Marks talked a great deal in German, how oppre&s;&s;ive it was, and much in op|po&s;ition to it, &s;eeming to be much enraged. His &s;on, and tho&s;e who came with him &s;eemed to be very noi&s;y and rude; they talked all in German, which as I did not know &s;ufficiently, I paid but little attention to them. They were making a great noi&s;e; huzzaing for liberty, and democracy, damning the tories, and the like. I let them go on, as I &s;aw no di&s;po&s;ition in the people to do any thing toward forwarding the bu&s;i|ne&s;s.

<P> Fries was not there, was he?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>No.&mdash;They &s;eemed to think that the collectors were all &s;uch fellows; the in&s;inuation was that they cheated the public, and made them pay, but never paid into the trea&s;ury.&mdash;After getting through the croud to the bar, I &s;uppo&s;e I was fifteen minutes in conver&s;ation with Mitchel: he &s;aid per|haps they were wrong, but the people were very much exa&s;perated. No|thing very material happened, and I a&s;ked Mr. Foulke if it was not time to be going. So I got into the Sleigh and went off; &s;oon after they &s;et up a dreadful huzza and &s;hout. I &s;topped at Jacob Fries's tavern, and waited for Mr. Foulke, who &s;oon came: Clark, the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or was likewi&s;e there. After talking a little more on the &s;ubject, Clark &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in not having any thing to do with it, for he thought it was not &s;afe for him. We thought it was be&s;t to give the other a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors notice, as their a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments were nearly fini&s;hed, to meet us at a certain day to take the rates in that town&s;hip. I then wrote to the other a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, re|que&s;ting them to meet at Quaker town, on the 4th of March, Rodrick, Childs and Foulke met me there: we waited till evening, but no others came; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o we agreed to meet at my hou&s;e next morning at 9 o'clock. We met, and I went with them to Milford, to Samuel Clark's, but he was not at home. It was thought be&s;t for me to go to &s;ee for Clark, as he was engaged in a moving. I went to Jacob Fries's tavern to wait for him; they went to Mitchel's to take the rates, Clark &s;oon came: he told me he could not undertake to take the rates, for that he might as well pay his fine if it co&s;t him all he had, for they were &s;o oppo&s;ed to it at any rate, that he could not think him&s;elf &s;afe, for at lea&s;t he &s;hould receive &s;ome private injury. Finding he would not do it I &s;aid no more. John Fries was coming up ju&s;t then: he told me he was very glad to &s;ee me: he told me that he under&s;tood I had been in&s;ulted in their town&s;hip at one of their meetings: he was very &s;orry for it: he mentioned 'Squire Foulke as well a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> my&s;elf: had he been there, he &s;aid, it &s;hould not have been done: I turned it off by this: that there was not a per&s;on among them that &s;poke a word to me. I told him I thought they were very wrong in oppo&s;ing the law as they did: he &s;ignified that he thought they were not, and that the rates &s;hould not be taken by the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. I told him that the rates certainly would be taken, and that the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors were then in the town&s;hip taking the rates. I repeated it to him, and he an&s;wered "my God!" if I was only to &s;end that man (pointing to one &s;tanding by) to my hou&s;e to let them know they were taking the rates, there would be 500 or 700 men under arms here to-morrow morning by &s;un ri&s;e. He told me he would not &s;ubmit to the law. I told him I thought the people had more &s;en&s;e than to ri&s;e in arms to oppo&s;e the law in that manner: if they did, go|vernment mu&s;t certainly take notice of it, and &s;end an armed force to en|force the laws. His an&s;wer was that "if they do, we will &s;oon try who is &s;tronge&s;t." I told him they certainly would find them&s;elves mi&s;taken re&s;pecting their force, he &s;ignified he thought not: he mentioned to me the troop of hor&s;e in Montgomery county, and the people at upper and lower Milford, and &s;omething about infantry, who were ready to join. He &s;aid he was very &s;orry for the occa&s;ion, for if they were to ri&s;e, God

knew where it would end: the con&s;equences would be dreadful; I told him they would be obliged to comply: he then &s;aid huzza, it <HI>shall</HI> be as it is in France, or <HI>will</HI> be as it is in France, or &s;omething to that effect. He then left me and went off.</P>

We then ordered our dinners there, and I believe it was Childs undertook to take the rates of Jacob Fries's hou&s;e. We had not gone out of the room after dinner, till John Fries came in, he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to 'Squire Foulke, telling him he was very &s;orry to &s;ee him there; he was a man that he had a great regard for, but that be was oppo&s;ed to the law him&s;elf. "I now wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> you, &s;aid he" not to go to another hou&s;e to take the rates, if you do, you will be hurt." He did not Wait for any reply, but turned him&s;elf about, and went off out of the room; I do not recollect any thing farther was &s;aid to him. He &s;eemed much irritated.

<P>All were at home, I think, except one, and there we left a notice. When we came to Jacob Fries's we met the principal a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. After din|ner, while we were &s;itting at the fire, John Fries came into the room: we had a room by our&s;elves. He &s;aid he heard we were come to take the rates of the town&s;hip; we told him yes. He &s;aid he would warn us not to proceed, el&s;e we &s;hould be hurt. He &s;aid he was &s;orry for '&s;quire Foulke, and I believe Mr. Chapman he mentioned, for he always re&s;pected them very much. He &s;aid he was oppo&s;ed to the law, and he would not &s;ubmit to it. He then left the room. He &s;eemed to be a little in a pa&s;&s;ion. We got on our hor&s;es, and proceeded at taking the rates: I and Foulke went together, and Childs by him&s;elf to &s;ome who we thought were quiet people. We proceeded on till about &s;un&s;et, when we were going to the hou&s;e of one Singma&s;ter, and as we turned down a lane, out from the road, we heard &s;omebody hallow to us: we &s;topped, and few it was John Fries and five men more. We &s;topped, and they came walking towards us. John Fries was in the front. Fries &s;aid that he had warned us not to proceed, and we would not hear, and now they were come to take us pri&s;oners. I believe I a&s;ked by what authority: with that he made a grapple at the bridle of my hor&s;e; I wheeled ray creature round, and he ju&s;t catched hold of my great coat, but he could not hold. I rode off then: after I had got a|bout two rod, I turned my creature round again; and he was a little way from the re&s;t. I told him I was &s;urpri&s;ed at his conduct, that he had be|haved &s;o.

<SP>
<P>At the meeting at Roderick's when we were qualified, we had our in&s;tructions given us by the commi&s;&s;ioner: he informed us that there were &s;ix a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors to twelve town&s;hips, which we were all equally concerned in a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, and it would be proper for us to point out which town&s;hips we would &s;everally take. I think this meeting was about the latter end of December. I made &s;ome objections, becau&s;e I could not talk the German language: they &s;aid that could make no difference, becau&s;e we were at liberty to call the others to a&s;&s;i&s;t us. To that I a&s;&s;ented, and we all agreed as to our di&s;tricts: Milford and Richland were a&s;&s;igned to Clark. I took Hill-town and New-Britain. I agreed reciprocally with Clark to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, and he me, as he could talk German, and in Hill-town there were many Germans. This was agreed in the pre&s;ence of the whole, and likewi&s;e Rodrick I made the &s;ame agreement with. I believe that this kind of arrangement was generally made by the whole, to a&s;&s;i&s;t each other. Accordingly Clark and my&s;elf fixed upon a day when I &s;hould come and a&s;&s;i&s;t him for two days, and another time was appointed for him to a&s;&s;i&s;t me. I had made &s;ome beginning in my own di&s;trict before that day came. Before we &s;eparated, the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or pitched upon an early day to make our return of what we had done, in order to examine whether we had proceeded right or not. I went up to Clark's agreeable to appoint|ment, and found he was not able to go on: I therefore attended to my own di&s;trict.</P>

<P>He was &s;ick and unable.&mdash;We met to make our returns at Rodrick's Everhard Foulke, I think, met with us, I know nothing of his appoint|ment. This was on the 5th day of the Bucks court (6th of February.) Not having gone through our bu&s;ine&s;s, we were to meet on the 16th
<PB N="74" REF="037104_0078_100D80ACC7F37DF0">
again. Foulke, I under&s;tood at the former meeting, had been appointed. When we met, enquiry being made what we had done: Foulke told James Chapman that he dared not go into the town&s;hip, for he under&s;tood that &s;ome threats were thrown out again&s;t him, and he rather wi&s;hed that the people would appoint &s;ome other per&s;on, them&s;elves, to do it. The commi&s;&s;ioner did not &s;eem to agree with it, but at la&s;t con&s;ented that if &s;uch could be done, he &s;hould not materially object: finally, he con&s;ented &s;o far as to intimate to James Chapman, that if they &s;hould make &s;uch an offer, and appoint one, he would recommend him, if not, he &s;aid we mu&s;t go and a&s;&s;i&s;t in that town&s;hip. There were &s;ome propo&s;als made who of us &s;hould go, excu&s;es were made, and then the commi&s;&s;ioner informed us that we were all enjoined as much to a&s;&s;e&s;s that town&s;hip as our own. Upon which he told the principal a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or that if it did not go on, he was to write to us, and we were to attend to the call. I received a letter about the fir&s;t of March, or the la&s;t of February from the principal a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, that he had been to Milford, and it did not &s;eem likely the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments could go on, and I was ordered to meet the re&s;t in Quaker town on the 4th of March. Accordingly, Foulke the principal a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or and my&s;elf met there. We had word from two others that they were not able to come. We concluded to call upon Clark to go with us, and divide the town&s;hip &s;o as to compleat it in a &s;hort time. The next morning we met to begin the bu&s;ine&s;s, we went to Clark's but he was not at home. It was agreed then that we &s;hould go on with the rates, and James Chapman was to go to Jacob Fries's to wait for Clark. The fir&s;t hou&s;e we went into was Daniel Wiedner's, I went in fir&s;t, and told him I was come to take down the rates, under the revenue act of the United States: he appeared to be very angry; I rea&s;oned with him, telling him, if he wi&s;hed to read the law he might: I told him the con&s;equences of oppo&s;ition, but he might have ten days to con&s;ider of it, and give in his account if he cho&s;e to take that time. He &s;eeing me thus &s;aid, "take it now &s;ince it mu&s;t be done," he gave me his account accordingly, and appeared contented. He &s;aid farther, "we have concluded not to take it, as we expect the act will be repealed." He meant they had concluded not to take till they knew what Congre&s;s would do with the law. I made reply to him that I be|lieved that was already done, for I had &s;een a report of a committee of Congre&s;s, that it was inexpedient to repeal it, and it was not done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COURT.</SPEAKER>
<P> Did he offer to read the law?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>No. He made &s;ome remarks, but I told him it was very wrong. I cannot tell what he &s;aid in particular. One thing I think was, that the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors were to have very extravagent wages. "It does not matter," he &s;aid, "you may as well give in my return." I did not get on my hor&s;e till I got up to Mitchell's where the other two a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors were. Wide|ner went out a little before me, and he was there when I came, walking about, &s;eemingly very angry; I again rea&s;oned with him. Another ob|jection he made was, that the hou&s;es of high value was to pay nothing, while &s;maller ones, and of &s;mall value was to pay high. I forgot to &s;ay that after the rates of Wiedner's land was taken he returned and &s;aid he had forgot, there was another piece of land: he then &s;at down with an heavy &s;igh and &s;aid. "They will play the devil with me; what &s;hall we do." I a&s;ked him what he meant, he made no an&s;wer. I told him I hop|ed every one would be as well convinced as he was. I took &s;everal hou&s;es
<PB N="75" REF="037104_0079_100D80AE56C1D9F8">
in my way, and went to Jacob Fries's. As I was going in at the door, I met John Fries, who &s;hook hand with me, told me he was glad to &s;ee we, and a&s;ked me to take a drink. He came in again after we had done dinner and &s;aid "I forbid you going to any other hou&s;es in the town&s;hip: he then mentioned that Foulke and Chapman, or Rodrick were men he much e&s;teemed. He &s;aid if we did go to any other hou&s;es, we &s;hould be, or would be, hurt. We then proceeded to a&s;&s;e&s;s. Where Engli&s;h people lived there appeared no objection, except at one place. The people there &s;aid, that if they did give in the account, there were &s;ome ordinary people in the neighbourhood, and they would be &s;et on by them to do them an injury. That afternoon I went to David Roberts's: his wife &s;eemed very anxious, and wi&s;hed her hu&s;band had been there, for &s;he &s;aid I &s;hould not go home alive. I went afterwards when he was at home, and he &s;aid he had no objection, only for his neighbours. After &s;ome conver&s;ation he &s;aid the people there had agreed not to let the rates be taken yet: he &s;aid they had already cho&s;en an a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or in their own town&s;hip: I told him I wandered they did not let him go on: he &s;ignified that he was a per&s;on of an obnoxious character, and therefore they did not wi&s;h to ac|cept of him. In our return home, I called at 'Squire Griffith's: as I got oft my hor&s;e, his wife told me that they were come there to take us, and that there were 40 or 50 men there, and &s;he did not know what they were about. A little girl ju&s;t after came in and &s;aid that they had hold of 'Squire Foulke's hor&s;e by the bridle, going to take him: I went to the window, and &s;aw them all round him. I did purpo&s;e to go out, but at their per&s;ua&s;ion I &s;taid. The little girl came in again, and &s;aid they had taken Mr. Foulke into Enoch Roberts's tavern. After a &s;hort time Fries came over into the hou&s;e where I was &s;itting: he took me by the band, and I ro&s;e up; he &s;aid, Mr. Childs, you mu&s;t go with me to my men, as we walked along he &s;aid "I told you ye&s;terday that you &s;hould not go to another hou&s;e, and if you did you would be hurt, and we are now come to take you pri&s;oner, if we find that you will go on with the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments." My an&s;wer was, we are obliged to fulfil our office, and we cannot do otherwi&s;e, unle&s;s we are prevented. I was endeavouring to inform him of the manner in which I had obtained the warrant, in hopes that I &s;hould prevail upon him to go on with the bu&s;ine&s;s, as Roberts had propo&s;ed, but he would not hear me. When we went into the hou&s;e. he addre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf to his men and me: "here are my men"&mdash;"here is one of them."</P>

<P>He appeared to be angry, but he did not appear to &s;how any revenge to me, or to talk angry.&mdash;I do not recollect that I knew any one in the hou&s;e, except the tavern keeper. Some of them &s;oon began to u&s;e rough language. A per&s;on then came behind me, and caught me by the collar over the &s;houlder, and &s;aid, "damn you Rodrick, we have got you now, "damn you, you &s;hall go to the liberty pole and dance round it;" the hou&s;e was then crouded as full as it could croud, and they pu&s;hed me up &s;o clo&s;e, that I could not turn round &s;ometimes for a con&s;iderable time: the per&s;on who caught me, &s;eemed to wi&s;h to keep behind me, but he &s;till kept hold of me: during this time I had &s;everal thumps, which &s;eemed, more with the knee than the fi&s;t. After &s;ome time he got to &s;ee my face: he damned me that I was not Rodrick, but that I was the other damned

&s;on of a bitch that he &s;aw &s;itting at Rock hill, he had mi&s;taken me. A &s;hort time after this, a per&s;on came up to me and &s;aid "keep a good heart, and you will not be hurt." I turned, or endeavoured to turn to them and &s;aid, "I am not Rodrick, nor did I ever a&s;&s;e&s;s in Rock hill:" he &s;aid "you are a damned liar." With that there were &s;till more of them came up, and pre&s;&s;ed about me more, and more took hold of me. There was a good deal of talk, &s;ome in German, and &s;ome in Engli&s;h. I then told them that my name was Cephas Childs; that I was not a man known in the county, but I had no doubt many of them, though they did not know my face, knew my name: by that there was &s;ome who knew me there as Coroner of the county; that man then &s;aid "if he is Childs, he is no better than the other." He a&s;ked me where I a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed: I told him: a number of them a&s;ked how they liked it where I had been. I told them &s;ome of them had appeared di&s;&s;atisfied in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, but as I believed, every man almo&s;t in the town&s;hips where I a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed were &s;atisfied, they again &s;aid I was a damned liar, for the people had told them that they would join them in the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of it, and my own neighbours would fight again&s;t me. I told them I thought I knew better than they; that if I was well informed they would not do &s;o. then they began again at me. Then they a&s;ked me if I had taken the oath of allegiance to the United States of America: I told them I had: they a&s;ked me when: I told them I could not recollect the time, but I knew it was as &s;oon as the law required it of me: they a&s;ked me if I was a friend to the government of the United States; I told them I was: they then began to damn the government, and the governor, and &s;hoved me about, many of them taking their Maker's name in vain: there then was a per&s;on who &s;poke very good Engli&s;h: they damned the hou&s;e tax and the &s;tamp act, and called me a &s;tampler repeatedly: they damned the alien law and &s;edition law, and finally all the laws: the government and all the laws the pre&s;ent Congre&s;s had made. They damned the Con&s;titution al&s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>What Con&s;titution?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>They did not mention what Con&s;titution, whether of this &s;tate or of the United States. They damned the Congre&s;s, and damned the pre&s;i|dent and all the friends to government, becau&s;e they were all tories, for that none were friends to the pre&s;ent government except tories. They a&s;ked me if I had been out in the la&s;t war: fir&s;t I told them the law did not require me to go, and then I &s;aid I was under the tuition of my parents: they &s;aid they had fought for liberty, and would fight for it again. They &s;aid they would not have the government, nor the Pre&s;ident, and they would not live under &s;uch a damned government: "we will have Wa&s;hington;" others &s;aid "No, we will have Jeffer&s;on, he is a better man than Adams: huzza for Jeffer&s;on."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>Who &s;aid &s;o?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>All of them.&mdash;They then in&s;i&s;ted on my taking an oath of allegiance to them, alledging that if I did &s;o, I &s;hould not be hurt. They in&s;i&s;ted on it &s;everal times, till at length I had no way to wave it, and then I a&s;k|ed them what their government was. One an&s;wered Wa&s;hington: I &s;aid I had taken an oath of allegiance to Wa&s;hington's government al|ready. They then &s;aid Jeffer&s;on; we will have none of the damned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">amplers, nor the hou&s;e tax. So they went on. They &s;aid they embo|died

And then they mentioned the number of men that had joined them, or &s;ent them word that they would join them. They mentioned, &s;ome an hundred, &s;ome more, &s;ome le&s;s, that they had there would do it, be&s;ides, they had all Northampton county to a man would join them, ex|cept &s;ome tories as they called them. Between Quaker town and Dela|ware river, I recollect they &s;aid they could rai&s;e 10,000 men if they &s;hould be wanted to oppo&s;e the &s;edition and alien laws. I cannot be certain, but I think he &s;aid (as he &s;poke in German) and fifty other damned laws. However I am not certain as to the number. They likewi&s;e &s;aid that General Wa&s;hington had &s;ent them account that he had 20, 000 men all ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in this undertaking to oppo&s;e the laws. I begged them not to believe it, for it could not be, and &s;omebody was endeavour|ing greatly to impo&s;e upon them: I thought I knew the &s;ituation of things better, and as for General Wa&s;hington, I was &s;ure he never would undertake &s;uch conduct as that.</P>

<P>Not that I know of.&mdash;They &s;aid Gen. Wa&s;hington had certainly wrote to them &s;o and &s;o. One of them &s;aid he would be damned if it was not &s;o, for he had &s;een the letter from Wa&s;hington; or &s;omething to that effect. During this time they were con&s;tantly pu&s;hing me; one would come to my back and get his knee up: they would endeavour to pu&s;h me on the &s;tove, one or two had hold of my hips and endeavoured to throw me down, others &s;eemed ready to lick me, and particularly after this conver|&s;ation about Wa&s;hington. About that time Captain Fries came toward me and &s;eemed very much &s;urpri&s;ed: He &s;aid, Mr. Child, I under&s;tand &s;ome of my men have abu&s;ed and in&s;ulted you. He really did appear to be very &s;erious; he &s;aid he would not allow me to be abu&s;ed; he appear|ed to be really di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for the u&s;age I had received, and if I would tell him who it was, he &s;aid he would make him behave him&s;elf. He then told me to come into the room. He &s;aid he re&s;pected me, and did not wi&s;h me to be abu&s;ed. I told him I thought it hard that he &s;hould leave me among&s;t a parcel of intoxicated people. I do not particularly recollect what I &s;aid, but he told me he hoped I would not impute that conduct to him: I told him I was not much injured, and therefore hoped he would not think about it. He &s;aid his men were civil men, and &s;eemed to wonder &s;uch a thing had happened. I think he then gave me &s;ome|thing to drink. He took me into a room, the farthe&s;t &s;ide of which

&s;eemed to be empty. When I got in there, he demanded my papers while I had been an a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. While he was with me no per&s;on in&s;ulted me, indeed &s;ome of them, when he came forward into the room where I was pu&s;hed off, out of the way. I then told him all that I had done, and rea&s;oned with him, but notwith&s;tanding that, he in&s;i&s;ted on my papers; I then told him I had no papers about me relative to the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment.</P>

<P> Who were in the room at the time the reque&s;t was made for the papers?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>I do not recollect any body particularly, but there were a great many crowded into the room after me.&mdash;He in&s;i&s;ted that I had the papers, I told him I had not got the papers, he &s;aid I had, and he would have them. I told him I had no papers about me, but what related to my onice of Coroner. I was going to deliver up to him my county tax papers, but he &s;aid I had other papers, I &s;aid I had not. He then looked on tho&s;e I had given him, and &s;aw Hilltown at the top, then he &s;aid Hoho! my boys, we have got what we wanted, and then turned about and went away. He left the pocket book, taking the papers with him. There was a con&s;i|derable huzza made, and they mo&s;t of them followed him out of the room. They were gone but a few minutes till they ru&s;hed in again as hard as they could ru&s;h, without Fries, and &s;ome got hold of me. They brought Daniel Weidner along with them: &s;ome had pi&s;tols, guns, clubs, Sec. and &s;ome &s;words. They &s;eemed very angry, and were pu&s;hing upon me while &s;ome endeavoured to put them off. Wiedner came up to me, and in&s;i&s;ted on the return of the rate I took of him ye&s;terday, he &s;aid he would have it. I de&s;ired him ju&s;t to acknowledge to the truth, Did not he give it me freely ye&s;terday: this while a per&s;on had hold of me, &s;ome of them &s;tepped up and &s;aid it was fair.

<P> Who was he?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>He was called Marks, the elder. I believe him to be the &s;ame man I have &s;een here.&mdash;While I was in this conver&s;ation, William Thomas came forward and &s;aid he knew me, and that they &s;hould not abu&s;e me. That gave me an opportunity of talking farther, and then I rea&s;oned with them of the bad tendency of &s;uch conduct, and told them that I re|ally thought if I had the law with me, I &s;hould per&s;uade them to allow of it. One of them who had abu&s;ed me before, came to me and acknow|ledged he had abu&s;ed me, and was &s;orry for it, and wi&s;hed me to forgive him. I think his name was Smith, but I am not &s;ure. After pa&s;&s;ing &s;ome time in conver&s;ation, Fries came back again with the tran&s;cript, and delivered it me, and told me as near as I can recollect in the&s;e words; I mu&s;t go home, and mu&s;t never come back again to a&s;&s;e&s;s, or I &s;hould be &s;hot, and in&s;i&s;ted on my promi&s;ing I would not do it. My reply was, that from the pains I had taken, I had left the town&s;hip with a view of not re|turning to it, unle&s;s compelled by authority, and from their pre&s;ent treat|ment, if they ever catched me going back without that authority, I would
<PB N="79" REF="037104_0083_100D80B6B08639D8">
give them leave to &s;hoot me. He then told me, Foulke and you may in|form the government what has been done as &s;oon as you plea&s;e, we can rai&s;e 1000 men in one day, and we will not &s;ubmit to it.</P>

<P>They &s;aid there were a number of laws they were oppo&s;ed to, and one of tho&s;e laws was now putting in execution, and they appeared to think if that was &s;topped, the others would be. This was how I under&s;tood it. The words were that they were determined to oppo&s;e the laws, and not let them be put into execution; there were &s;o many laws coming on it was time to &s;top them, and if they were known to oppo&s;e them, they ex|pected the others would not be brought forwards.</P>

<P>Will your honour plea&s;e to give the Jury an account of the circum&s;tances of your i&s;&s;uing warrants in Northampton county, and of circum&s;tances within your knowledge previous to the examination of John Fries on the 6th of April.</P>

<SPEAKER>WITNESS.</SPEAKER>
<P> The fir&s;t time I heard officially of this unea&s;ine&s;s in the counties of Bucks, Northampton and Montgomery, was &s;ometime in Fe|bruary, I cannot preci&s;ely recollect what time. I had heard of it before as a piece of news, but this was the fir&s;t time I heard it officially: it was by depo&s;itions being &s;ent to me by the attorney of the di&s;trict (Mr. Sit|greaves) relative to a number of per&s;ons. After that I examined &s;ome witne&s;&s;es relative to it, and upon the whole I concluded to i&s;&s;ue my war|rants again&s;t the parties charged. Being much engaged in the di&s;trict court, the attorney of the di&s;trict drew up the form of the warrants for my &s;ignature and approbation. We had concluded, by way of ca&s;e to the people, that the&s;e warrants &s;hould be drawn up in a form of order for the defendant to appear before &s;ome ju&s;tice of the peace, or judge of the coun|ty in order to give bail for their appearance at the circuit court of the United States. Neither of us then knew of tho&s;e in&s;urgents, as it turned out afterwards to have got to &s;uch a head. But I doubted my&s;elf of the propriety of the form and &s;ub&s;tance of the warrants, becau&s;e I thought that the ju&s;tice, or judge before whom bail was taken, ought to be ac|quainted with the whole ca&s;e, and ought to have the proof of the fact before him, on which the proof of the warrant was found. I had &s;ome doubt too, whether it was legally right for per&s;ons taken by my warrants to go before an inferior magi&s;trate. For though a ju&s;tice of the peace of any &s;tate has a right by the laws of the United States to take cognizance in the fir&s;t in&s;tance of crimes again&s;t the United States, and bind over the offenders to the proper court, yet I did not think that, as &s;uch ju&s;tice had not had the original cognizance of the matter, there would be a propriety in my ordering him to take &s;econdary notice of it. While I was he&s;itating on this point, I received informati|on of the length to which, at that time, this oppo&s;ition to the law had ar|rived. I doubted very much, and this thought was afterwards clearly confirmed to me, whether the magi&s;trates of tho&s;e counties, and particu|larly Northampton, would choo&s;e to take cognizance of &s;uch offences, or would cho&s;e to do any bu&s;ine&s;s concerning them. There were two of
<PB N="80" REF="037104_0084_100D80BA51D50488">
the magi&s;trates, one of them a ju&s;tice of the peace, the other a &s;tate judge, who had done them&s;elves much honour in per&s;evering &s;o far as they did in endeavouring to bring tho&s;e criminals to ju&s;tice. But finally it turned out that they were obliged to abandon even every endeavour towards ex|ecuting this bu&s;ine&s;s. So that the law, and the public authority, &s;o far failed as it re&s;pected that county, that the judicial authority of the Unit|ed States became entirely pro&s;trate. I found that tome of the very per|&s;ons who were charged before me were magi&s;trates, and I wi&s;h I could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that they were the only magi&s;trates who were engaged in this bu&s;ine&s;s. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> were the rea&s;ons that induced me to alter the form of my warrants. I found that too many magi&s;trates were concerned in flattering the pre|judices of the people, and engaging in &s;editions practices, and encouraging the people in their mi&s;takes for me to tru&s;t them, and I finally found that there were but two magi&s;trates that could be depended upon, and they told me that they were in&s;ulted in the performance of their duty for the United States: of this I had good evidence. And farther: it arrived to &s;uch a pitch that I could not get one of the&s;e gentlemen even to i&s;&s;ue a &s;ubpoena to examine witne&s;&s;es, and &s;ave them the great trouble and ex|pence of coming before me. This was the opinion of tho&s;e two gentle|men; one of them wrote me, and the other informed me, that they were afraid to perform &s;uch an act. They could not only not get per&s;ons to &s;erve the proce&s;s, but they could not get the witne&s;&s;es to appear before them. This I do not bring as a charge again&s;t any particular per&s;on, but as a rea&s;on why the warrants were thus i&s;&s;ued. Another rea&s;on was that tho&s;e people had taken up the fallacious notion that they would not appear before me, and therefore I thought it be&s;t, though this &s;hould not have been my leading motive, to convince them that every per&s;on in this di&s;|trict ought to obey a warrant i&s;&s;ued by me, and appear at &s;uch time and place as I directed; the whole di&s;trict being to be con&s;idered the &s;ame as a county in re&s;pect to a &s;tate.</P>

<P>The mar&s;hal wrote to me official &s;tatements at &s;undry times of the diffi|culties he met with, and at one time informed me that the pri&s;oners had been re&s;cued, by force of arms, from his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The account he gave me it is unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;tate, being much &s;imilar to what has been given in evidence: He took &s;ome engagement from tho&s;e pri&s;oners, particularly tho&s;e of Lehi town&s;hip, that they would appear before me, which, the pri|&s;oners them&s;elves told me, was chearfully given. I under&s;tood from them, and other channels, that they &s;everal times attempted to come down before me and deliver them&s;elves up, but they were prevented by per&s;ons who interrupted them, and would not let them come.</P>

<P>At the time I received the notice from the fir&s;t commi&s;&s;ioner that was appointed in the commi&s;&s;ion, the commi&s;&s;ioners were to meet at Reading on the 22d of October. After a board were met, every commi&s;&s;ioner was de&s;ired to make a plan of his divi&s;ion, and to divide it into &s;uch a &s;uitable number of a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment di&s;tricts, as to have the law executed in a rea&s;onable time: at the &s;ame time each commi&s;&s;ioner was reque&s;ted to make out li&s;ts of per&s;ons qualified for the office of a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors in each divi&s;ion. As &s;oon as this was done, as the law gives a power to the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury to reduce the number of a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors if too large, the clerk made cut a li&s;t, and &s;ent it to the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury; a li&s;t was al&s;o en|tered in the Commi&s;&s;ioners book. Some few alterations were made in &s;ome di&s;tricts afterwards, but at the time the board was &s;itting. After this was done, the form of the warrant was agreed upon by the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners, and ordered to be printed. They were then filled up, and every warrant &s;igned by all the Commi&s;&s;ioners. A rule was then adopt|ed to call all the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors together in each di&s;trict, and the Commi&s;&s;ioners was to meet and qualify them and give them in&s;tructions.</P>

<P> Yes, in many in&s;tances, &s;ome very &s;trong, it was even at|tempted to rai&s;e troops to oppo&s;e the army if they went up. There were one or two in&s;tances of te&s;timony given to me that troops were endea|voured to be rai&s;ed, and nothing, I believe, but the rapidity of the pro|gre&s;s of the troops prevented its execution. I did believe that unle&s;s the army had gone through the whole country, there would have been the mo&s;t atrocious in&s;tances of violence.</P>

<P>Did not &s;ome of the witne&s;&s;es give their te&s;timony under great reluct|ance, owing to fear?</P>

<P>Yes, I had, in &s;ome in&s;tances, to &s;tate the protection of the United States, and their determination to lay hold of per&s;ons who &s;hould threaten, in order to &s;timulate them: &s;ome &s;aid, after they had given their te&s;ti|mony, that they were afraid to go home. I can really &s;ay, that, in ge|neral, they were the mo&s;t unwilling witne&s;&s;es I had ever examined. I got evidence that &s;ome of them were forming a&s;&s;ociations for actually oppo&s;ing the troops. One man was even afraid becau&s;e I was in his hou&s;e, a&s;king for &s;ome refre&s;hment, as, he &s;aid, he &s;hould be &s;u&s;pect+ed for harbouring me; however, after I had expre&s;&s;ed my own &s;ecurity, he &s;eemed &s;atisfied.</P>

<P>Mr. Dallas gave notice that, though they wi&s;hed to give as little trou|ble on the part of the defendant as po&s;&s;ible, yet he &s;hould produce two or three witne&s;&s;es in order to &s;hew that this indi&s;po&s;ition, which was mani|fe&s;ted to permit the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment, was owing to the uncertainty tho&s;e people were in, of the real exi&s;tence of the law, and that the pri&s;oner him&s;elf had declared that it was no law, and that they had no idea of oppo&s;ing Con|gre&s;s by force of arms, but that they wi&s;hed for time, in order to a&s;cer|tain its real exi&s;tence, and if the law was actually in force, that they wi&s;h|ed, agreeable to their former cu&s;tom, to appoint a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors from their own re&s;pective town&s;hips: al&s;o we mean to &s;how that Fries was perfectly ac|quie&s;cent after the proclamation, and that Mitchel was entirely mi&s;taken as to the expre&s;&s;ions &s;aid to be u&s;ed by Fries at the meeting at Conrad Marks's. However, as we wi&s;h to have time previou&s;ly to examine the witne&s;&s;es we mean to bring, we &s;hall not be able to produce them at this &s;tage of the trial.</P>

<P>Mr. RAWLE, then opened the con&s;titutional definition of trea&s;on, as con&s;i&s;ting of only two parts: "levying war again&s;t the United States, and aiding the enemies of the United States." As it is only the fir&s;t of the&s;e &s;pecies of trea&s;on the pri&s;oner is charged with, it is only nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;|certain
<PB N="86" REF="037104_0090_100D80C8E4AC0BD8">
what is meant by levying war again&s;t the United States. Mr. Sitgreaves has &s;tated that, levying war again&s;t the United States con&s;i&s;ted, not only in a broad &s;en&s;e of rebellion openly manife&s;ted, with an avowed intention of &s;ubverting the government and con&s;titution of the country, but al&s;o with force of arms, or by numbers &s;ufficient for that purpo&s;e, to cau&s;e an impre&s;&s;ion of terror: the&s;e, either one, or all together, u&s;ed to prevent the execution of the laws, or of any particular law of the United States from motives, not of a &s;pecial but of a general nature&mdash;is trea&s;on. This po&s;ition I believe is perfectly correct, and has already received the &s;anction of a court of the United States, re&s;pecting the in&s;urrection in the we&s;tern parts of Penn&s;ylvania. See a Dallas 348. Mitchel's ca&s;e&mdash;This doctrine is laid down in terms &s;hort and conci&s;e and is &s;uch as is founded on the particular authority of all the writers on Engli&s;h law.</P>
<P>Page 355. Bradford&mdash;attorney. The de&s;ign of the meeting was avow|edly to oppo&s;e the execution of the exci&s;e law; to overawe the govern|ment; to involve others in the guilt of the in&s;urrection; to prevent the puni&s;hment of the delinquents, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Patter&s;on (Ju&s;tice)&mdash;The fir&s;t que&s;tion to be con&s;idered is, what was the general object of the in&s;urrection? If its object was to &s;uppre&s;s the ex|ci&s;e offices, and to prevent the execution of an act of Congre&s;s, by force and intimidation, the offence, in legal e&s;timation, is high trea&s;on; it is an u&s;urpation of the authority of the government; it is high trea&s;on by levy|ing war. Taking the te&s;timony in a rational and connected point of view, this was the object. It was of a general nature, and of a national concern.</P>
<P>Let us attend, for a moment, to the evidence. With what view was the attack made on General Neville's hou&s;e? Was it to gratify a &s;pirit of revenge again&s;t him as a private citizen, as an individual? No:&mdash;as a private citizen he had been highly e&s;teemed and beloved; it was only by becoming a public officer, that he became obnoxious, and it was on ac|count of his holding the exci&s;e office alone, that his hou&s;e had been a&s;&s;ail|ed, and his per&s;on endangered.&mdash;They were arrayed in a military manner; they affected the military forms of negociation by a flag; they pretended no per&s;onal ho&s;tility on General Neville; but they in&s;i&s;ted on the &s;urren|der of his commi&s;&s;ion. Can there be a doubt, then, that the object of the in&s;urrection was of a general and public nature.</P>
<P>Page 340. Patter&s;on (Ju&s;tice) in the charge again&s;t Rigol.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the intention, there is not, unhappily, the &s;lighte&s;t po&s;|&s;ibility of doubt: To &s;uppre&s;s the office of exci&s;e, in the fourth Survey of this &s;tate; and particularly, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, to compel the re&s;igna|tion of <HI>Wells</HI> the exci&s;e officer, &s;o as to render null and void, in effect, an act of <HI>Congress,</HI> con&s;tituted the apparent, the avowed object of the in&s;ur|rection. Combining the&s;e facts and this de&s;ign, the crime is <HI>high treason.</HI></P>
<P>This you will perceive, gentlemen of the Jury, is not preventing the execution of <HI>all</HI> the laws, or <HI>all</HI> the authority of the government, but of "<HI>an</HI> act of Congre&s;s." It is an u&s;urpation of the authority of the go|vernment, and thus it is levying war, and is <HI>high treason.</HI> Taking it in this point of view, this was the very object of the in&s;urgents at Northampton, and was of a public, of a general, and not of a private or &s;pecial nature. In the ca&s;e I referred to, the pri&s;oner acted different from the pri&s;oner at the Bar; he acted in a &s;ubordinate &s;tation; he does not appear to be a fir&s;t character in that trea&s;onable enterprize.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="037104_0091_100D80CA69F856C8">
Gentlemen, the law thus laid down by the court upon that occa&s;ion was derived from the Engli&s;h authorities to which I &s;hall now refer you. 4. Black&s;tone, p. 81. defines that branch of trea&s;on of which we are now treating&mdash;"Levying war again&s;t the King (&s;ub&s;titute here the U. States for King) is, pulling down all enclo&s;ures, meeting hou&s;es, pri&s;ons or brothels"&mdash;Although bawdy hou&s;es are illegal, yet by any individuals not authori&s;ed, taking the authority which alone is ve&s;ted in the government, it is an u&s;urpation of the authority, and the act being of a general, and not of a &s;pecial nature, is <HI>treason.</HI> Lord Chief Ju&s;tice Hale, who&s;e name will ever be endeared by the piety, the humanity, and the found legal learning which characteri&s;ed him, has a chapter upon this &s;ubject of le|vying war again&s;t the King. 1. Hales pleas page 105. He &s;ays to march with colours flying, drums beating, &amp;c. if on a matter of a pub|lic or general nature, is high trea&s;on, but if on a private quarrel or for a private purpo&s;e, it is not trea&s;on. Trea&s;on in levying war, by this defi|nition, con&s;i&s;ts of two &s;orts. Fir&s;t, marching expre&s;sly, or directly again&s;t the King's forces: &s;econdly, interpretatively, or ob&s;tructively; doing a thing of a general nature. Page 133. If to pull down a particular inclo&s;ure, it is only a riot, but if to pull down all inclo&s;ures, it is levy|ing war again&s;t the King, becau&s;e it is generally again&s;t the King's laws.</P>
<P>Fo&s;ter, p. 211. In&s;urrections in order to throw down <HI>all</HI> inclo&s;ures, to alter the <HI>established law</HI> or change religion, to inhance the price of <HI>all</HI> labour or to open <HI>all</HI> pri&s;ons&mdash;all ri&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ngs in order to effect the&s;e inno|vations of a <HI>public and general concern by an armed force, are,</HI> in con&s;truc|tion of law, <HI>high treason,</HI> within the clau&s;e of levying war. In&s;urrections, likewi&s;e, for the reformation of <HI>real</HI> or <HI>imaginary</HI> evils <HI>of a public nature, and in which the insurgents have no special interest,</HI>&mdash;ri&s;ings to effect the&s;e ends by force and numbers, are, by con&s;truction of law, within the clau&s;e of levying war.</P>
<P>1. Hawkins, Chap. xvii. Sect. xxiii. p. 37. is much to the &s;ame effect. Dougla&s;s, 570. in the ca&s;e of Lord G. Gordon. The ca&s;e there on the part of the pro&s;ecution was an attempt to force the repeal of an act of Parliament, and this was called high trea&s;on, although the defendant was not convicted. Keyling p. 70. on the ca&s;e of Me&s;&s;enger, Appletree and others, and 75, ibid.</P>
<P>It will probably be &s;aid by the defendant's Council that this &s;hould be &s;imply con&s;idered as a re&s;cuing pri&s;oners from the cu&s;tody of the Mar&s;hal, and that is not trea&s;on, and that a number of crimes of a le&s;s degree mu&s;t be committed in order to make it trea&s;on, as Ar&s;on, Burglary, and Murder. But I would ob&s;erve, that when the&s;e crimes are committed, one or more of them, they are not component parts of trea&s;on, but they lo&s;e their qualities and their name in the ab&s;orbing crime&mdash;<HI>treason.</HI> So when general Nevil's hou&s;e was burnt, it was &s;aid only to amount to Ar&s;on: to that it was an&s;wered by Judge Patter&s;on, were it not for the trea&s;onable purpo&s;e with which this was done, it would be &s;o, but the guilt ro&s;e to trea&s;on in the intention. Admitting it is a crime, and wor|thy of a puni&s;hment, the que&s;tion is, whether, or not, it mu&s;t be con&s;i|dered as one of the means made u&s;e of to obtain the end in view. 1. Hale 133. If a man break open pri&s;on, except where a per&s;on is convict|ed for trea&s;on, it was ruled to be only a great riot: if &s;everal were re&s;|cued thereby, it was a riot and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, except tho&s;e per&s;ons re&s;cued were
<PB N="88" REF="037104_0092_100D80CC47217080">
convicted for trea&s;on, and where it was without any particular view to the per&s;ons them&s;elves, and where the pri&s;oners were unknown, then the re&s;cue becomes a part of the trea&s;onable act, and that, with other facts con&s;titutes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e per&s;on guilty of trea&s;on. In 4 Black&s;tone you will find an an&s;wer to what Mr. Dallas &s;aid this morning ought to be in favour of the pri&s;oner: to wit, an ignorance of the exi&s;tence of the law.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e every man who would profe&s;s him&s;elf ignorant of the exi&s;tence of a law was exculpated from the ob&s;ervance of it, or from the con&s;e|quences of breaking it, to what would that doctrine lead! It would be for the intere&s;t of every man who wi&s;hed to oppo&s;e a law, to keep him&s;elf under the &s;helter of this want of knowledge, in order that he might &s;in with impunity&mdash;without knowing it. This is a mi&s;taken fact, and an er|ror in point of law. I make the&s;e ob&s;ervations, not becau&s;e I &s;uppo&s;e that the defence will be &s;eriou&s;ly &s;et up, or that, did it exi&s;t, you would be in the lea&s;t guided by it, but under the impre&s;&s;ion that when you come to examine all the facts, you will di&s;cover that it was not &s;o.</P>
<P>Unle&s;s the&s;e points which I have laid down are controverted, I &s;hall not trouble you with more points of law, and &s;hall leave the ob&s;ervations I am farther to make, to a later period of the ca&s;e.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please your Honors: GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT has become &s;o uncommon in the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania to be employ|ed in a cau&s;e, upon the i&s;&s;ue of which the life of a fellow creature depends that, I am confident, the court and jury, as well as the council on both &s;ides, are prepared to give a &s;olemn, candid and patient attention to the pre&s;ent inve&s;tigation. It is, gentlemen, a que&s;tion of <HI>Life</HI> or <HI>Death;</HI> and if what we have heard is true, that the pri&s;oner is a hu&s;band, and a father, it is a que&s;tion who&s;e importance extends beyond his own life, to the ex|i&s;tence and well-being of a mi&s;erable family. If I &s;hould manife&s;t there|fore, an extraordinary &s;olicitude to &s;ecure the attention of the jury, as long as the occa&s;ion &s;hall require, the&s;e con&s;iderations would, I think, fur|ni&s;h a &s;ufficient excu&s;e: yet, permit me to add to my ju&s;tification ano|ther remark. It is not only the life of John Fries, and the well-being of his family, that are at &s;take on this trial, but, we all know, that the im|pre&s;&s;ions made on your minds, and communicated to the public by your verdict, may reach the lives and families of many more unhappy men now under indictments for a &s;imilar crime. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that I feel agitated by the pro&s;pect: for, if it appears &s;o awful, &s;o intere&s;ting, as it evidently does, to the court and audience, how mu&s;t it affect us who are the council for the pri&s;oner, charged with the developement of every principle and of every fact, that can tend to an acquital? As it relates to the Council for the pro&s;ecution, the difficulties are comparatively &s;mall. They have had an opportunity amply to explore all the facts; to calcu|late the effects to be produced, and to point their te&s;timony preci&s;ely to the object of the charge. We, who are council for the pri&s;oner, are ig|norant
<PB N="89" REF="037104_0093_100D80CFAC478A70">
of the man and of his connections. Till you were impannelled, we knew nothing of the evidence to &s;upport the pro&s;ecution; and could; therefore, be little prepared to encounter and repel it, Be&s;ides, in all our enquiries for the means of defence, as well as in our examination of the witne&s;&s;es, we have been embarra&s;&s;ed by the foreign language in which the parties have &s;poken. That &s;ome of you, however, as well as the op|po&s;ite council under&s;tand the German, has been a &s;ource of con&s;olation to us; for, it is your province to decide on the facts.</P>
<P>But the&s;e are not the only ob&s;tacles which we have to encounter. I am &s;ure I &s;hall not be mi&s;under&s;tood when I &s;ay, that the pro&s;ecution appears to be &s;trongly marked with the authority and influence of government.</P>
<P>It is, I grant, incumbent upon the government to exerci&s;e its powers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or the puni&s;hment of crimes; but it is e&s;&s;ential to a fair di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of every accu&s;ation, that the acts of the government &s;hould not be e&s;timated as proofs of the pri&s;oner's guilt. Thus, though you find by the proclama|tion of the Pre&s;ident (which, doubtle&s;s, he thought, with a wife and up|right intention, was required by the extraordinary circum&s;tances of the times) that the di&s;turbances in Northampton were deemed overt acts of trea&s;on by his advi&s;ers; and though this denunciation was followed by the march of a con&s;iderable army for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of &s;ubduing and apprehending the traitors; you will recollect, that you are to decide whether trea&s;on has been committed, from the evidence of the witne&s;&s;es, and not from the opinions of the government. Again: great inconveni|encies have been experienced by many meritorious citizens, who relin|qui&s;hed the pur&s;uits of bu&s;ine&s;s, and the plea&s;ures of dome&s;tic life, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the in&s;urgents; but you will not allow the irri|tation and re&s;entment proceeding from this &s;ource, to transfer from your judgments to your pa&s;&s;ions, the determination of the cau&s;e. Far be it from me to contend that outrages have not been committed, which are di&s;reputable to the &s;tate or &s;ociety at large, and to the character of Penn|&s;ylvania in particular; or to endeavour to &s;helter from the puni&s;hment of the law, the in&s;tigators and perpetrators of &s;uch offences. Every citizen is intere&s;ted, and is bound to a&s;&s;i&s;t in detecting, pro&s;ecuting, and puni&s;h|ing the offenders; but every citizen, let it be remembered, is &s;till more intere&s;ted, that even the greate&s;t criminals &s;hould only be puni&s;hed in the manner and to the degree which the law pre&s;cribes. However we may differ on &s;peculative points of politics abroad, however we may be di&s;po&s;ed to approve, or to di&s;approve, the mea&s;ures of admini&s;tration, and however we may controvert or a&s;&s;i&s;t, the con&s;titutionality, or the expedi|ency, of particular laws, all party &s;pirit, all per&s;onal animo&s;ity, mu&s;t be abandoned when we are called upon to act as mini&s;ters of ju&s;tice; or we &s;hall, in the indulgence of a moment's vengeance, overthrow tho&s;e barriers which are our own &s;ecurity, and the pledge of &s;afety to po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Whatever you may have thought, whatever you may have &s;aid, what|ever you may have heard, in other &s;cenes, mu&s;t now be obliterated from your minds. The character of private citizens, with all the privileges of private opinion and feeling, is here exchanged for the character of pub|lic functionaries, with all the re&s;traints of law and ju&s;tice. Your opini|ons as private men, will only be regarded according to their intrin&s;ic me|rit; but your verdict as a jury will be forever obligatory, bearing all the authority of a precedent.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="037104_0094_100D7DD012E26D48">
Though, then, a proclamation has i&s;&s;ued, an army has marched, and po|pular re&s;entment has been excited, we claim an unbia&s;&s;ed attention; and circum&s;cribing your view of the &s;ubject to the evidence, we confidently ex|pect a fortunate re&s;ult. What has happened in England upon a &s;imilar occa&s;ion, we think will happen here. The Briti&s;h Privy Council an|nounced a traitorous con&s;piracy to the Briti&s;h Parliament. The Briti&s;h Parliament declared that the party recognized and confirmed the charge of high trea&s;on and thus the whole weight of public authority in that coun|try, legi&s;lative and executive, in&s;tituted a pro&s;ecution, which was, after|wards, conducted with the greate&s;t zeal and talents&mdash;with &s;uch zeal and talents as the pre&s;ent pro&s;ecution has di&s;played. What was the event? A jury (that ine&s;timable palladium) without fear, and without favour, ex|amined and pronounced that no trea&s;on had been committed. I allude to the recent ca&s;es of Horne Tooke and Hardy.</P>
<P>I &s;hall, I pre&s;ume, be excu&s;ed, if I intimate to you &s;ome other di&s;ad|vantages under which the pri&s;oner's ca&s;e labours; for, it is not merely nece&s;&s;ary to produce evidence, to explain, extenuate, or refute the charge; we mu&s;t guard your minds again&s;t any previous bias, any latent pre-de|termination to convict. The accu&s;ed gentleman, and his companions, you will recollect, are not upon their trial among per&s;ons, with whom they have been accu&s;tomed to live. This is a di&s;advantage, which every candid man will acknowledge. They are to be tried, likewi&s;e, by a jury, &s;elect|ed and returned by the mar&s;hal, the very officer who has been per&s;onally in&s;ulted, and who&s;e appointment depends on the will and plea&s;ure of the executive magi&s;trate&mdash;that magi&s;trate by whom the offenders have already been de&s;cribed as traitors. I mean not to ca&s;t the lea&s;t reflection upon the laws of Congre&s;s, nor upon the officers of the government; but to make a general remark on the defective &s;tate of our judicial in&s;titutions. The conduct of the mar&s;hal has, indeed, been highly exemplary through|out the tran&s;action; and when with &s;uch powers he returned &s;uch a jury as I have the honor to addre&s;s, he manife&s;ts an impartiality and independ|ence of character, that entitles him to the re&s;pect and plaudits of his country. Nor is it here that the pri&s;oner's di&s;advantages terminate: but I hope, I believe, that never 'till this day was the Pre&s;s employed in a ba&s;e and &s;anguinary attempt to intimidate the jury and council from a faithful execution of their duty in a capital ca&s;e! Since, however, the jury have been &s;ummoned; nay, &s;ince the court have been &s;itting upon this very trial, there have been the gro&s;&s;e&s;t, the mo&s;t in&s;idious practices in a public new&s;paper, to warp your &s;entiments, and to deprive the unfortu|nate pri&s;oner of the benefit of the be&s;t talents, which the bar of Penn&s;yl|vania can afford. On the other hand, a gentleman, who&s;e abilities we all re&s;pect, and who&s;e long re&s;idence in the offending counties mu&s;t great|ly facilitate the progre&s;s of the pro&s;ecution, is a&s;&s;ociated, without cen&s;ure, and certainly without being an&s;werable, in the duties of the attorney of the di&s;trict. While our ignorance of characters, and circum&s;tances per|plexes the defence; his accurate information and experience enable him to probe every witne&s;s to the quick, and forcibly to combine and inter|weave all the incidents of the tran&s;action. But his motives are pure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for, if he does arraign; if he does convict; if he does puni&s;h; it is be|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">au&s;e his patrioti&s;m and public &s;pirit enable him to &s;oar far beyond the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> affections of a neighbourhood.</P>

Gentlemen, in this &s;ituation we appear before you as advocates for the pri&s;oner. I declare that as far as my mind is capable of being im|pre&s;&s;ed by a &s;en&s;e of duty, I feel a terror le&s;t any thing &s;hould be left undone, or un&s;aid, which is e&s;&s;ential to the cau&s;e: and, therefore, compli|cated as the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be, accept, I pray you, my &s;enti|ments under the following heads.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, I will endeavour to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch points of law, as &s;eem to me to be applicable to the facts which have been given in evidence.</P>
<P>Secondly, I will con&s;ider the general &s;tate of the di&s;contents, and how far the re&s;cue at Bethlehem was connected with the previous di&s;turbances.</P>
<P>Thirdly, I will take a review of the conduct of the pri&s;oner in particu|lar.</P>
<P N="1">I. With re&s;pect to the crime of trea&s;on, I hold the con&s;titutional act in my hand by which it is defined. The gentleman who opened this pro|&s;ecution, has very ju&s;tly &s;aid, that the words of the definition were bor|rowed from a &s;tatute very much admired in the Engli&s;h code; but I do not think that he has very ju&s;tly added, that, becau&s;e the United States have borrowed the language of the &s;tatute, they have, al&s;o, adopted all the inferences and expo&s;itions of the Briti&s;h courts. It appears, indeed, that Lord Hale (I. Vol. p. 132) thought, that even the Engli&s;h courts had carried their deci&s;ions on the &s;tatute too far, and emphatically warns the judges from proceeding further in the dangerous doctrine of "con&s;truc|tive trea&s;ons." Speaking of pa&s;t ca&s;es, he &s;ays <Q>tho&s;e re&s;olutions being made and &s;ettled, we mu&s;t acquie&s;ce in them, but, in my opinion, if new ca&s;es happen for the future, that have not an expre&s;s re&s;olution in point, nor are expre&s;sly within the words of 23 Ed. 3. though they may &s;eem to have a parity of rea&s;on, it is the &s;afe&s;t way, and mo&s;t agreeable to the wi&s;dom of the great act of 23 Ed. 3. fir&s;t to con&s;ult the parliament and have their declaration, and to be very wary in multiplying con&s;tructive and interpretative trea&s;on, for we know not where it will end.</Q> It &s;hould be premi&s;ed, that in that celebrated &s;tatute of 25 Ed. 3. on which is founded our definition of trea&s;on, there was a provi&s;ion made, that if the overt act charged, or the crime &s;uppo&s;ed to be committed, did not come, &s;pecifically, within the words of the &s;tatute, the judges &s;hould not pronounce it high trea&s;on, but mu&s;t refer it to the parliament. Hale, the great and good, applauds the provi&s;ion; and when he &s;ays, that the courts have gone far enough, does not the &s;trength of his expre&s;&s;ion imply, that they had gone too far?&mdash;"Be very wary in multiplying con&s;tructive trea|&s;ons, for we know not where it will end." Now, it is &s;aid, that becau&s;e we have brought the words "levying war" from the Engli&s;h &s;tatute, we, therefore, adopt all the interpretations of the Engli&s;h courts; but I deny the propo&s;ition, becau&s;e I think it is dangerous as well to the policy of our con&s;titution as to rights of individuals. In the &s;ame &s;tatute of the 25 Ed. 3. there is another crime, called compa&s;&s;ing the king's death; and levying war has been con&s;trued to be an overt act of that &s;pecies of trea|&s;on. Hence the gentleman will find that there is &s;ome confu&s;ion in the Engli&s;h books on the doctrine of levying war, con&s;idering it &s;ometimes as a &s;ub&s;tantive and independent of trea&s;on, and at other times con&s;idering it merely as evidence of a traitorous de&s;ign again&s;t the life of the monarch. It is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive, indeed, any thing more ab&s;urd than con&s;truc|tive trea&s;on, as it has been applied to compa&s;&s;ing the death of the king.
<PB N="92" REF="037104_0096_100D80D7F0B6D728">
Any man who &s;hould u&s;e a &s;ingle expre&s;&s;ion, a loo&s;e word, among friends, or enemies, that could be tortured, by the mo&s;t circuitous proce&s;s, into any thing like a wi&s;h for the king's death, was termed a traitor. In Black|&s;tone's Commentaries, it is mentioned, that an innkeeper, ludicrou&s;ly de|clared that his &s;on was heir to the crown; meaning that he was heir to the tavern, which had the &s;ign of a crown; yet, the expre&s;&s;ion was con&s;trued into trea&s;on, and the man &s;uffered as a traitor. In another in&s;tance, the king killed a deer belonging to one of his poor &s;ubjects, who upon the fir&s;t impul&s;e of his re&s;entment, wi&s;hed the deer, horns and all, in the king's belly; and the man was al&s;o hanged as a traitor. So far will con&s;tructi|on go, and, in &s;uch a manner may a man's life be endangered! If con&s;truc|tive trea&s;ons are admitted in this country, no man will be &s;afe: It may de&s;troy my life; it may de&s;troy your's.</P>
<P>In England this &s;pecies of trea&s;on is con&s;idered in two lights; levying war again&s;t the per&s;on of the monarch, and levying war again&s;t his autho|rity. I wi&s;h you to know preci&s;ely upon what footing this di&s;tinction prevails in England, becau&s;e I &s;hall a&s;k you pre&s;ently, what &s;pecies of trea&s;on ought to be con&s;idered as adopted by the principles, as well as the terms of our con&s;titution. Levying war again&s;t the per&s;on of the mo|narch con&s;i&s;ts in any attempt to dethrone him; either with a view to change the government, or merely to &s;upplant the per&s;on who admini&s;ters it. The act is unequivocal, and meets the common &s;en&s;e of every man. But levying war again&s;t his authority, is &s;o indefinite, that any thing and every thing may be made trea&s;on; the intemperance of a mob, as well as the ho&s;tility of an army. Independent of all technical rea&s;oning, then, let me a&s;k you, upon the &s;ugge&s;tions of common &s;en&s;e, whether you per|ceive more in the recent occurrences than a great riot; a lawle&s;s di&s;turb|ance of the public peace, a daring re&s;cue? Was there in the mind of any man, till the denunciation contained in the proclamation of the Pre&s;ident, and the march of the army, an idea that trea&s;on had been committed? Till then, the guilt in ob&s;tructing the <HI>execution</HI> of the laws was not deno|minated trea&s;on, nor was the puni&s;hment expected, death!</P>
<P>In order, however, to examine this point of law more minutely, and to apply it to the facts, let me ob&s;erve that from the Engli&s;h books (who&s;e authority, however, is not implicitly admitted) two general propo&s;itions are to be collected:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, The <HI>intention</HI> mu&s;t be to levy war.</P>
<P>Secon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> War mu&s;t be <HI>actually</HI> levyed <HI>against the government.</HI></P>
<P>When I &s;ay, emphatically, that the <HI>intention</HI> mu&s;t be to levy war, I mean that the intention, free of all con&s;tructive matter, mu&s;t be to com|mit that de&s;cription of crime, which the gentleman concerned for the pro|&s;ecution calls "levying war." Without that preci&s;e intention, however criminal the intention may be in other re&s;pects, the offender cannot be guilty of trea&s;on. A man, or a mob, may intend to commit a crime; a man may be armed, or a mob may be arrayed, for the purpo&s;e; and the utmo&s;t force may be u&s;ed to accompli&s;h it; but it is no trea&s;on, unle&s;s the intention was trea&s;onably to levy war: though it may be ar&s;on; or it may be riot, &amp;c. If the avowed object is to &s;ubvert the government; to drive Congre&s;s from its legi&s;lative function; to &s;eize the Pre&s;ident, &amp;c. and in&s;tead of the e&s;tabli&s;hed order of things to introduce anarchy, or mo|narchy, the act would be plainly and unequivocally within the meaning of levying war.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="037104_0097_100D80DA43A08720">
It is true, that the Engli&s;h books go further; and con&s;ider an attempt by force to ob&s;truct the execution of <HI>all laws,</HI> or to compel <HI>the repeal</HI> of a particular law, as a con&s;tructive trea&s;on within the de&s;cription of le|vying war. But the ob&s;truction of <HI>all laws</HI> is, in fact, an attempt to &s;ubvert the government, and to compel the repeal of a law, is a very dif|ferent thing from a temporary interference with its <HI>execution.</HI> Conceding therefore, as far as the Engli&s;h authorities go, and as far &s;urely, as the in|tere&s;ts of our government can require, there is no precedent of a con&s;truc|tive trea&s;on to warrant a conviction in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e; the oppo&s;ition was not directed again&s;t all laws; nor was there any force employed to com|pel a repeal of the obnoxious Act. In <HI>Foster</HI> 211, as read by Mr. Rawle, you will find the reference is particularly made to the ca&s;e of forcing the repeal of a law, or laws, &amp;c. and not a word about oppo&s;ition to <HI>the execution</HI> of a particular law. What, then were the origin and cha|racter of the late ri&s;ing of the people? Was it not an oppo&s;ition given to certain officers merely from a doubt of the exi&s;tence of the law; or till the people had a&s;certained whether other counties conformed to the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ments, or till the inhabitants of town&s;hips were indulged in appointing their own a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors? Let me a&s;k you, whether the&s;e characteri&s;tics are within the &s;cope of the law of levying war? Remember what Hale &s;ays, "Do not let a parity of rea&s;oning allure you; be very wary that you do not add to the catalogue of con&s;tructive trea&s;ons. Judge Black&s;tone too, has been quoted by Mr. Rawle (Vol. 4. p. 81) where he &s;peaks of trea&s;on as an "attempt to <HI>reform</HI> religion, or the laws;" but I intreat your attention to the di&s;tinction which the pa&s;&s;age it&s;elf is calculated to e&s;tabli&s;h. Eve|ry one knows that the term <HI>reform</HI> the laws, means <HI>repeal</HI> the laws. The current of Legi&s;lative power is uniform. Tho&s;e who made, can alone an|null a law, and if a reformation is produced, it mu&s;t be by applying to the legi&s;lature. If the application is made with force, or menaces, the Engli&s;h writers declare, and we may &s;afely allow that it would be an act of levy|ing war. But where is the analogy between that ca&s;e, and the ca&s;e of re&s;i&s;ting a &s;ubordinate officer, while executing his part of a particular law?</P>
<P>Now gentlemen, I challenge the pro&s;ecuting council to &s;ay, in what part of the evidence it has appeared, that the&s;e in&s;urgents went further than to declare that the law did not plea&s;e them; that though they did not mean to compel Congre&s;s to repeal it, they had &s;ome doubts, and wi&s;hed to a&s;certain whether it exi&s;ted or not; to know whether the country in general had &s;ubmitted to it; to know whether General Wa&s;hington was not di&s;&s;atisfied with it, and to &s;ee whether they could not get the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or appointed by them&s;elves. Under the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions many irregularities oc|curred, but I a&s;k the adver&s;e council to point out if they have di&s;covered through the whole cour&s;e of the bu&s;ine&s;s, any in&s;urrection exi&s;ting, any traitorous de&s;ign, till the meeting at Bethlehem; or whether till that moment the people of Northampton could be &s;aid to have been guilty of any crime?</P>
<P>We are told that the ca&s;e of the we&s;tern in&s;urgents in 1794, is in point; and that the deci&s;ions upon the trials that then took place, are precedents on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion; but, with great deference, I declare that it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible to bring ca&s;es more di&s;&s;imilar into view, where violence has been committed in both. At this &s;tage of the argument however, I
<PB N="94" REF="037104_0098_100D80DBC8E173E8">
&s;hall only remark, that whatever may have been the language of the judge, who then pre&s;ided, I am &s;ure the attorney of the di&s;trict will be good enough to recollect, and candid enough to &s;tate, that the oppo&s;ition, though in its origin, excited again&s;t the exci&s;e law, was conducted with the avow|ed purpo&s;e of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing all the excite offices, and compelling Congre&s;s to repeal the act, See 2 Dallas Rep. 346.</P>
<P>Let us for a moment, gentlemen, trace the motives of the people, by looking at their conduct not at large, but in the lawle&s;s &s;cene at Bethle|hem. What did they do? why they re&s;cued the mar&s;hal's pri&s;oners; but the moment they had effected the re&s;cue, did they not di&s;per&s;e? Their whole object then was con&s;ummated; for, I mu&s;t pre&s;ume that they contempla|ted nothing farther, as I &s;ee them attempt nothing more; and yet the time was very favourable to accompli&s;h a more exten&s;ive de&s;ign, if it had ever been meditated. Men intending to compel, by every ho&s;tile means, the repeal of a law, when they had in their hands the obnoxious agents of that law (Mr. Balliott, Mr. Eyerly, the mar&s;hal and others) would hardly have let the moment pa&s;s without &s;ome effort to triumph in their advan|tage. It was, indeed rumoured to be their intention to di&s;patch Mr. Ey|erly; but where does it appear? Was he not compleatly in their power? Was he not con&s;tantly in their view, though he incorrectly &s;ays that he was con&s;tantly out of their view? No: I repeat that the rioters having accompli&s;hed the re&s;cue, di&s;per&s;ed; and will you, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, in a ca&s;e of life and death, determine that they came to commit trea&s;on? rejecting the plain fact, and adopting a con&s;tructive inference? But if they proceeded no farther than I have &s;tated, let us again look to the law of England, to define their crime, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from trea&s;on? and you will not cea&s;e to bear in mind that <HI>you</HI> mu&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h the di&s;tinction. Hales pleas vol. 1 p. 133&mdash;4. Bacon's abridgment vol. 6. p. 513&mdash;4&mdash;5.</P>
<P>Fo&s;ter Sect. 2. 210 "ri&s;ings to maintain a <HI>private</HI> claim of right, or to de&s;troy <HI>particular</HI> inclo&s;ures, or to break pri&s;ons, in order to relea&s;e <HI>par|ticular</HI> per&s;ons have not been holden to amount to levying war within the &s;tatute.</P>
<P>Upon this principle a ri&s;ing of the weavers in London, to de&s;troy all en|gine-looms, machines, &amp;c. did not amount to levying of war&mdash;for the judg|es con&s;idered it merely as a matter of private quarrel between men of the &s;ame trade, about a particular engine, which tho&s;e concerned in the riot thought detrimental to them."</P>
<P>Now, if we &s;hould be fortunate enough in the cour&s;e of this bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;how that, however criminal the&s;e people may be, yet, that taking it alto|gether, their intention was only to acquire information, to &s;ee what really was the &s;tate of the country, and to procure town&s;hip officers of their own appointment: if &s;o, though they achieved the re&s;cue, we have done with the indictment for trea&s;on; the verdict mu&s;t conform to the evidence, and the judgment to the verdict. That the offence is an aggravated mi&s;de|meanour, I will not deny; but it ought to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from Trea&s;on; and, I think, I &s;hall &s;oon evince that it never was within the view of our legi&s;lature to con&s;ider it as the trea&s;on contemplated by the con&s;titution. Give me leave, then, to a&s;k (and I beg, gentlemen, as this is a matter of con&s;truction, that you, who are to fix the intention, will give candid at|tention) whether the facts prove more than the breaking open a particular pri&s;on, in order to re&s;cue particular pri&s;oners? Was not the matter of a
<PB N="95" REF="037104_0099_100D80DF01091360">
partial, local nature, to make a particular, and not a general re&s;cue, for which a particular pri&s;on (if it may be &s;o de&s;cribed) was violated? And as to the previous oppo&s;ition what was it more than a partial ob&s;truction of particular officers, to prevent in a particular town&s;hip, <HI>the execution</HI> of a particular law. At Kline's the people &s;aid to the ex-a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, "we will not let you come into our town&s;hip 'till we know whether it is a law or not; and if we mu&s;t be a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, it &s;hall be by a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of our own town&s;hip." A gentleman in behalf of the pro&s;ecution has told us, that we are to re|ceive as authority all the adjudications given to the them "levying war" in England: But if I can produce an authority higher than the Engli&s;h parliaments, or the Engli&s;h courts to prove that the pre&s;ent ca&s;e ought not to be included in the de&s;cription of trea&s;on, I pre&s;ume he will not reject it becau&s;e it is American: I mean the authority of our own legi&s;lature. Before, however, I turn to the act of Congre&s;s, I will attract your atten|tion, gentlemen, by one propo&s;ition. If the legi&s;lature has explicitly cla&s;&s;ed an offence under a particular head in the penal code, it is incon|&s;i&s;tent and ab&s;urd to &s;earch for it, and puni&s;h it under another head. For in&s;tance, if the legi&s;lature has declared that re&s;cuing pri&s;oners, not under &s;entence of death, &s;hould be puni&s;hable only with fine and impri&s;onment, it would be incon&s;i&s;tent, by arguing, in a circle, that a re&s;cue with force and numbers, is a combination for the purpo&s;e of preventing the execution of a law, and that &s;uch a combination is trea&s;on, by levying war. 1 Hales pleas 151. Keyling 75. Fo&s;ter p. 200. Sect. 7.</P>
<P>If the offence to which I refer had been trea&s;on, it would not have con&s;i&s;ted with the wi&s;dom of the legi&s;lature to make it a mi&s;demeanour: and on this ground it is, that I now a&s;k you to reflect, which &s;pecies of levying war, the direct or the con&s;tructive, was within the view of the framers of our con&s;titution? Did they not intend to exclude every de|&s;cription of con&s;tructive trea&s;on? But to proceed; if I can demon&s;trate, that every thing which has occurred of a criminal nature, from the com|mencement of the bu&s;ine&s;s, to its con&s;ummation, and regarding every pre|vious di&s;content as tending to the particular re&s;cue at Bethlehem (which is the utmo&s;t the oppo&s;ite council will pretend) has been con&s;idered by the legi&s;lature of the United States, (who&s;e acts I repeat, are entitled to more re&s;pect than all the Briti&s;h authorities, parliamentary or judicial) as high mi&s;demeanours, and not as trea&s;on; then I am entitled to in&s;i&s;t, that the con|&s;titutional provi&s;ion does not embrace the ca&s;e; or if it does embrace the ca&s;e that Congre&s;s, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the power to declare the puni&s;hment of trea|&s;on, has limited the puni&s;hment of one &s;pecies of the offence at lea&s;t, to fine and impri&s;onment. Li&s;ten to the act, "If any per&s;on or per&s;ons &s;hall knowingly and wilfully ob&s;truct, re&s;i&s;t or oppo&s;e any officer of the United States in &s;erving, or attempting to &s;erve or execute any me&s;ne, proce&s;s, or warrant, or any rule or order of any of the courts of the United States, or any other legal or judicial writ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> proce&s;s what&s;oever, or &s;hall a&s;&s;ault, beat or wound any officer, or other per&s;on duly authorized in &s;erving or executing any writ, rule, order, proce&s;s or warrant afore&s;aid, every per&s;on &s;o knowingly and wilfully offending in the premi&s;es, &s;hall, on conviction thereof, be impri&s;oned not exceeding twelve months, and fined not exceed|ing three hundred dollars," Shall it be contended then, that ob&s;tructing the mar&s;hal, who was employed in &s;erving proce&s;s, con&s;titutes the crime of trea&s;on!

And yet &s;uch ab&s;urdity is imputed to the national le|gi&s;lature, &s;ince in the 23d &s;ection of the &s;ame law, it is enacted, that "if any per&s;on, or per&s;ons &s;hall by force &s;et at liberty, or re&s;cue any per&s;on, who &s;hall be found guilty of trea&s;on, murder, or any other capital crime, or re&s;cue any per&s;on convicted of any of the &s;aid crimes, going to execu|tion, or during execution, every per&s;on &s;o offending, and being convicted thereof, &s;hall &s;uffer death: and if any per&s;on &s;hall, by force, &s;et at liberty, or re&s;cue any per&s;on who before conviction &s;hall &s;tand committed for any of the capital offences afore&s;aid; or if any per&s;on or per&s;ons &s;hall by force &s;et at liberty, or re&s;cue any per&s;on committed for, or convicted of any other offence again&s;t the United States, every per&s;on &s;o offending &s;hall, on con|viction, be fined, not exceeding 500 dollars, and impri&s;oned not exceeding one year," Thus, if a malefactor was actually under the gallows when re&s;cued, the re&s;cue would have been but a capital offence; and the &s;ame con&s;equence is now attempted, where the per&s;ons re&s;cued had been admitted to their parole, and were in cu&s;tody of the officer, merely upon me&s;ne pro|ce&s;s. It was a matter of honour that made them re&s;ign them&s;elves to his cu&s;tody, and it was, in effect, a matter of form that he kept them in cu&s;|tody: for, we find, that as he took their parole to meet him at Bethle|hem, &s;o at the moment of the re&s;cue, he took their parole to meet him in Philadelphia, which they have all punctually done.</P>
<P>Here then you find, gentlemen, that we have two of the prominent fea|tures of this ca&s;e reduced to the form of po&s;itive law: to wit, the ob|&s;truction of the mar&s;hal in the &s;ervice of his proce&s;s, and the re&s;cue of pri&s;oners from his cu&s;tody. But there is another circum&s;tance to which I would wi&s;h, likewi&s;e, to lead your attention. You find there was an in|di&s;po&s;ition to allow a particular cla&s;s of officers to make the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments; and the people urged, that if it was to be done, it &s;hould be done by their own a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. In this important point, therefore, the particular officers, and not the law, form the object of re&s;entment and oppo&s;ition. On this di&s;tinction, I have the re&s;pected authority of Mr. Bradford, the late attor|ney general of the United States, for a&s;&s;erting that the offence was riot, not trea&s;on. In his argument in the United States <HI>v.</HI> Mitchel (2 Dallas Rep. 354.) he &s;tates that <Q>an oppo&s;ition was lately made to the appointment of a particular judge, in Mifflin county, and he was forcibly driven from the bench. But the offence was pro&s;ecuted merely as a riot, upon this principle of de&s;crimination, that the de&s;ign was not to prevent the go|vernor from appointing any judge, but only to di&s;place an unpopular individual.</Q> So even if the unpopular a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, in&s;tead of being fore|warned not to enter the town&s;hip, had been forcibly expelled from it, the offence would not have been trea&s;on, but not.</P>
<P>I am arrived, however, to the la&s;t and conclu&s;ive evidence of the &s;en&s;e of Congre&s;s upon this &s;ubject: from which it will be proved that the &s;ame cautious, and in re&s;pect to puni&s;hment, the &s;ame benevolent, legi&s;lature, had con&s;idered all that the ingenuity of any gentleman can &s;ugge&s;t as
<PB N="97" REF="037104_0101_100D80F4F1A90728">
criminal in the lawle&s;s career of the rioters, and defining the offence to be a mi&s;demeanor, excludes the idea of its being a trea&s;on. Let us turn to the act commonly called the &s;edition act. Congre&s;s have there declared, that fine and impri&s;onment &s;hould be the only puni&s;hments for the offence which appears on the evidence to have been committed by the pri&s;oner. I a&s;k you, gentlemen, to reflect one moment upon the te&s;timony that you have heard upon this trial, while I analy&s;e the fir&s;t &s;ection of the law. Has John Fries been guilty of a combination and con&s;piracy to ob&s;truct the execution of the laws? In this act, his puni&s;hment is pre&s;cribed. Im|pri&s;onment and fine. Did he intimidate a public officer? Here is the puni&s;hment. Is there in the whole tran&s;action any councilling, or advi&s;|ing, or any efforts towards producing an in&s;urrection, it is puni&s;hable by this law. The law contains the&s;e de&s;criptions of offence: Fir&s;t, combina|tion with intent to oppo&s;e any mea&s;ures of government, or to impede the operation of the laws of the United States. This offence, notwith&s;tanding its generality, is only puni&s;hable with fine and impri&s;onment. Secondly, an intimidation of per&s;ons, who are applied to for the purpo&s;e of execut|ing a law, &s;o as to prevent their accepting the office, or having accepted it, to deter them from di&s;charging the duties annexed to it. This is the offence that will be urged upon you: all the di&s;turbances of Northampton county; all the tittle tattle and alarms of commi&s;&s;ioners and a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, will be arrayed again&s;t the unfortunate pri&s;oner to affect his life: and the ag|gregate will be &s;welled into the &s;ize, and depicted in all the malignity of trea&s;on, though the law &s;ays it is nothing more than a mi&s;demeanour. "Yes," you will hear it exclaimed, "Fries is the leader; he is the very life of the mob: it was he who advi&s;ed, he who addre&s;&s;ed, he who alarm|ed, he who intimidated, he who re&s;cued!" Did he &s;o? Then this law will puni&s;h him for a high mi&s;demeanour; but I can di&s;cover no law to puni&s;h him for trea&s;on. I am &s;en&s;ible that if I err in my opinion, tho&s;e who pro|&s;ecute will be able to di&s;criminate, between the ca&s;e proved by the evi|dence, and the ca&s;e defined in the &s;edition law. I have not the ingenuity to perceive it; and I hope you will only give that weight to the re&s;pec|tive arguments which they re&s;pectively merit. Nay, I am per&s;uaded, that the humanity of the pro&s;ecuting council, will induce them to ab&s;tain from any har&s;h expo&s;ition of the principle, as well as from any &s;trained applica|tion of the evidence, involved in the controver&s;y. The law provides for combinations formed for all the&s;e purpo&s;es, whether they have been carri|ed into effect or not, the &s;imple puni&s;hments of fine and impri&s;onment. Simple do I call it! re&s;pecting this man, do we not know how exemplary it may be rendered. Suppo&s;e the judge was to impo&s;e a fine of 5000 dollars, can 5000 dollars come from the pur&s;e of John Fries? And if it cannot come from his pur&s;e, then the power of remi&s;&s;ion is in the chief magi&s;trate alone; and unle&s;s he thinks that the public will &s;u&s;tain no in|jury from the convict's liberation, his &s;entence of five years may be pro|tracted to an impri&s;onment for life, and the total deprivation of the means by which his family can be re&s;cued from wretchedne&s;s and ruin. It is not therefore, a &s;imple puni&s;hment. But, permit me to repeat, that every de&s;cription that can be given of the di&s;turbances in the northern counties, is to be found in the law I have referred to; and if the legi&s;lature, which mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to be as wife, as guarded, and as well-informed, as courts, or juries, in regulating the intere&s;ts of the community, has thought proper
<PB N="98" REF="037104_0102_100D84FCB8371148">
thus to de&s;cribe the crime, and pre&s;cribe the puni&s;hment, &s;hall we pre|&s;ume to be more wi&s;e, and a&s;&s;ume a power to be more penal? If the le|gi&s;lature was contented to cla&s;s the&s;e actions with mi&s;demeanours, &s;hall the de&s;ignation be expunged by this court, or arbitrarily transferred to the catalogue of con&s;tructive trea&s;ons? Shall a jury &s;itting here;&mdash;&s;hall a judge &s;itting there;&mdash;declare that though the offence is unequivocally pointed out by law, yet in their ideas of di&s;tributive ju&s;tice, the penalty ought to be enhanced, and the man ought to be hanged! In every autho|ritative book, in regard to criminal ca&s;es, the mo&s;t liberal interpretations are given to laws which mitigate puni&s;hments. Then let us &s;uppo&s;e that the legi&s;lature when the &s;edition law was pa&s;&s;ed, contemplated the crime of trea&s;on without a view to the di&s;tinction of direct and con&s;tructive trea&s;on. The crime is defined by the con&s;titution, but the puni&s;hment is not; and, therefore, an early act of Congre&s;s, agreeably to the power ve&s;t|ed in that body, affixed the puni&s;hment of death: but, it will not be de|nied, that Congre&s;s might at that time have inflicted only the puni&s;hment of fine and impri&s;onment, as is the ca&s;e in the penal code of Penn&s;ylvania. If, therefore, Congre&s;s has the power to modify the puni&s;hment and if we di&s;cover in the Sedition act a full de&s;cription of trea&s;on, whether direct or con&s;tructive, ought we not to con&s;ider it, upon the liberal principle of expounding penal &s;tatutes, as an intended mitigation of the puni&s;hment, and a virtual repeal of the pre-exi&s;ting &s;anctions? If there is any incon|&s;i&s;tency in the two laws, &s;o that they cannot &s;tand together, the former mu&s;t be pre&s;umed to be annulled by the latter, and the greater puni&s;hment is &s;uper&s;eded by the le&s;s, becau&s;e enacted &s;ub&s;equent to it. The word <HI>in|timidate,</HI> u&s;ed in the Sedition act, is of exten&s;ive meaning; it is not a mere feeling which would ari&s;e from &s;aying you will &s;uffer among your fellow citizens; it is a feeling which operates upon the mind from an ap|prehen&s;ion of per&s;onal danger, and may be the effect of every &s;pecies of force or menace. 1 Hale's pleas 3 and 6 Bacon 513. The&s;e authorities &s;how what arraying in arms is, with a view to commit a crime; but prove that if the intention is not trea&s;onable, it is not trea&s;on, however violent the act might be, and whatever may be the military array of the actors; and the intimidation to which the law applies, embraces every de&s;cription of force that can po&s;&s;ibly be contemplated, in order to accompli&s;h the me|ditated purpo&s;e;&mdash;the ob&s;truction of proce&s;s,&mdash;the re&s;cue of pri&s;oners, the &s;urrender of office;&mdash;or the re&s;i&s;tance of a law. Fo&s;ter 219 Sect. 10. "Attacking the king's forces in oppo&s;ition to his authority upon a march, or at quarters, is levying war again&s;t the king. But if upon a &s;udden quarrel, from &s;ome affront given or taken, the neighbourhood ri&s;e and drive the forces out of their quarters, that would be a great mi&s;demeanour, and if death &s;hould en&s;ue, it may be felony in the a&s;&s;ailants, but it will not be trea&s;on, becau&s;e there was no intention again&s;t the King's per&s;on or go|vernment."</P>
<P>1 Hale's pleas 146. "If any of the King's troops be killed, it is felo|ny." An open re&s;i&s;tance to the ju&s;tices of Oyer and Terminer in the county of Surry was felony. Here a &s;udden attack upon the King's troops on their march, though this mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a direct attack upon the government, yet, if any quarrel ari&s;e between them and the people, it is no trea&s;on. So, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, all the object of the&s;e people was to obtain a little time to procure information. To that we attribute their
<PB N="99" REF="037104_0103_100D84FF1B829E28">
conduct toward Rodrick Childs and other officers: it aro&s;e from the im|pul&s;e of the moment, and though directed again&s;t public officers, ought not to be denominated levying war again&s;t the government. The whole purpo&s;e and extent of every violent word or ge&s;ture, terminated in the intimidation of tho&s;e officers. Do we hear a variety of men whi&s;pering to Eyerly he was in danger of his life? Look at the fact: he goes the rounds with the mar&s;hal, to &s;erve the proce&s;s again&s;t the very men, who are alleged to have pronounced the threat, yet no danger attends him: he appears repeatedly at the windows at Bethlehem amid&s;t the tumult, yet no outrage is offered: the active leaders of the mob level guns at him, yet not a trigger is drawn! It was in &s;hort, a mere &s;y&s;tem of <HI>inti|midation,</HI> without a de&s;ign to u&s;e force, much le&s;s to commit trea&s;on. Nay, I will pledge my&s;elf in &s;aying that there was great art u&s;ed on the part of the pri&s;oner to accommodate the matter with the officers in every &s;tage of the tran&s;action, and to prevent per&s;onal injury or any kind of vi|olence. The ca&s;e of the judges of Oyer and Terminer, referred to in Hale, is &s;urely as &s;trong as the pre&s;ent. Tho&s;e judges were as much au|thori&s;ed then, as the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors are now; and the non-reception, or acknow|ledgment of both, as public functionaries was the offence.</P>
<P>The acts committed during this &s;cene of tumult, ought to be puni&s;hed, and I hope will be puni&s;hed; but as acts of riot and &s;edition, not as acts of trea&s;on.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible that it is po&s;&s;ible to draw di&s;tinctions, to refine upon the meaning, and pervert the language of the act: but on principles of hu|manity, I am confident the gentlemen oppo&s;ed to us will ab&s;tain from a mere exerci&s;e of ingenuity and eloquence, while we, who contend in favor of life, have a claim to every indulgence; a right to the benefit of every &s;hade of di&s;crimination.</P>
<P>It has been laid down by the oppo&s;ite council, that there mu&s;t be gene|rality of object, in order to con&s;titute the crime of trea&s;on. If an in&s;ur|rection takes place, by which it is de&s;igned to oppo&s;e all the laws, it needs no rea&s;oning to convince any man that a &s;ubver&s;ion of the government is intended, and that this is trea&s;on: But this I contend, is the only &s;pecies of trea&s;on which ought to be recognized under a republican form of govern|ment, and to which alone the language of our con&s;titution can be fairly applied. I am ju&s;tified in the po&s;ition, becau&s;e the legi&s;lature has a&s;&s;erted it. If the con&s;titutional language may be &s;atisfied in that manner, the diver&s;ity introduced by the legi&s;lature ought at lea&s;t to be judicially re&s;|pected; &s;o that when the legi&s;lature having provided the puni&s;hment of death for levying war, provides a different puni&s;hment for offences, which according to the Engli&s;h books would be con&s;trued into that very &s;pecies of trea&s;on, we are bound to &s;ay that the Engli&s;h con&s;tructions are falla|cious and that taking advantage of Lord Hale's advice, the framers of our con&s;titution have not only rejected the pa&s;t deci&s;ion (by which they were never bound as the Engli&s;h judges are) but have guarded again&s;t the accumulation of interpretative trea&s;on. When, therefore, I &s;ay that to oppo&s;e all laws, and to re&s;i&s;t all the authority of the government, is a palpable levying of war, which requires no technical aid to define or ex|plain, I go as far as the terms of the con&s;titution nece&s;&s;arily demand; and I think we are not authori&s;ed to go farther. I think I am right, al|&s;o, when I &s;ay, that the legi&s;lature has di&s;tingui&s;hed the offence committed by the pri&s;oner, from trea&s;on, and provided a different puni&s;hment for it.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="037104_0104_100D8500BA12ED98">
Recurring to the we&s;tern trials, let me repeat that the direct, the avow|ed object of the in&s;urrection of 1794, was to &s;uppre&s;s all exci&s;e offices, and to compel a repeal of the exci&s;e law; but can it be pretended that on that occa&s;ion, or on any occa&s;ion, a verbal menace to an officer, the re&s;cue of a pri&s;oner, or a temporary re&s;i&s;tance to the execution of a law, ari&s;ing from a doubt of its exi&s;tence, was declared to be trea&s;on? Where &s;hall we &s;top gentlemen, if &s;uch con&s;tructive trea&s;ons are allowed? It is im|po&s;&s;ible for human genius, or human &s;tudy to provide a barrier again&s;t the con&s;equences. The framers of our con&s;titution, the legi&s;lature of the union, one would imagine had taken every practicable precaution again&s;t the admi&s;&s;ion of con&s;tructive trea&s;ons; but if we are to adopt the expo|&s;itions, and the principles of expo&s;ition, of the Engli&s;h courts, the wi&s;dom of our own country has been exerci&s;ed in vain. If a forcible oppo&s;ition to the partial execution of a &s;ingle law, by a particular &s;et of officers, is trea&s;on as the gentlemen allege, with a parity of rea&s;on, it may be pro|nounced, that a non-compliance with any lawful requi&s;ition of an author|i&s;ed officer, con&s;titutes the &s;ame crime. Open that door, and the mi&s;chief will be carried much farther, will become more dangerous to civil liberty, and per&s;onal &s;afety, than any thing which, the metaphy&s;ical di&s;qui&s;itions on the crime of compa&s;&s;ing the King's death, have generated in En|gland. If any act that will interfere with carrying the laws and mea&s;ures of government into effect, is trea&s;on, what a privileged order our public officers in&s;tantaneou&s;ly become, what an enviable &s;ecurity they attain! Upon the whole di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this point of law, then, I conclude, that on the legitimate definition of levying war as applied to our form of govern|ment; and on the authority of the American legi&s;lature, no trea&s;on has been committed. There was no force employed again&s;t the government; no general object to overthrow the con&s;titution and laws; no direct at|tempt, by arms or intimidation, to compel Congre&s;s to repeal the obnoxi|ous act: but the whole was a great and unju&s;tifiable riot&mdash;&s;editious in its origin; daring in its progre&s;s; and iniquitous in its effects.</P>
<P>I proceed to the con&s;ideration of another point of law, and enquire that &s;uppo&s;ing this ca&s;e to be trea&s;on, how is it to be proved? The fir&s;t clear rule is, that the overt act mu&s;t be proved in the county in which it is &s;aid to have been committed, as on the pre&s;ent indictment in the county of Northampton. 4 Hawkins ch. 46. &s;ect. 184, 5, 6. p. 454. It was mentioned by Mr. Sitgreaves, that the &s;pecific overt act, with which Fries is charged, was re&s;cuing the pri&s;oners at Bethlehem; but this does not ap|pear on the face of the indictment. If, however, that act was trea&s;on, then not only the act, but the traitorous intention, mu&s;t be proved in the proper county, as the intention and the act, are both e&s;&s;ential to the crime. Now, for a moment, overlook the general narrative of di&s;contents and di&s;turbances, di&s;mi&s;s from your minds all the previous, and all the &s;ub&s;equent tran&s;actions, and confining your ideas preci&s;ely to the affair at Bethlehem, pronounce whether there appeared at that time and place any thing more than a de&s;ign to re&s;cue the pri&s;oners? It is, I a&s;&s;ert, my right to call for full proof of guilt, where the indictment &s;tates that the guilt was incurred. At Bethlehem, then, from the commencement to the clo&s;e of the tumult, who can trace an act of levying war again&s;t the United States? The truth is, that before John Fries came on the borders of Northampton county, the military array, of which you will hear a great
<PB N="101" REF="037104_0105_100D85048EB71AE8">
deal by and by, had taken place; and the people had got to the bridge of Bethlehem. But there is no evidence that any of the active men in op|po&s;ing the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, were pre&s;ent at the bridge, at the time the re&s;cue was contemplated; and from the fir&s;t convening at Schwartz's 'till the mo|ment of their taking the pri&s;oners, what were the views of the party, as declared to Me&s;&s;rs. Henry, Balliott, and Eyerly? Why, that they came there &s;imply to re&s;cue the pri&s;oners. The &s;incerity of the declaration is corroborated by the powerful con&s;ideration, that if there was a de&s;ign to annihilate the laws, or to per&s;ecute and injure the officers, the opportunity as I before ob&s;erved, could never be more favourable to en&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s. Such facts &s;peak &s;tronger than the &s;tronge&s;t language: And is it not con|clu&s;ive, that a re&s;cue only was in view, when we hear, that in le&s;s than ten minutes after the &s;urrender of the pri&s;oners, the whole multitude di&s;|per&s;ed, leaving the commi&s;&s;ioners, a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, ju&s;tices and mar&s;hal uninjured and unannoyed upon the &s;pot? There is one incident, however, which, perhaps you may notice: one of the two per&s;ons who were detained at Bethlehem in the morning, on being a&s;ked how he came there, &s;aid that he under&s;tood there was to be a meeting about tho&s;e laws, and that he came to &s;ee what would be done about them; but with this &s;ingle excep|tion, it is ob&s;ervable that not a word was &s;aid at Bethlehem re&s;pecting the exi&s;tence, execution, ob&s;truction or repeal of any unpopular act; not a word e&s;caped but in relation to the re&s;cue of the pri&s;oners. In that re&s;cue, the pro&s;ecuting council &s;ay they di&s;cover the generality of object, which even the Engli&s;h doctrine calls for in the definition of trea&s;on by a con&s;tructive levying war; and in&s;i&s;t that the particularity of object, which would extenuate and reduce the crime, is not to be found. Is it &s;o contended, becau&s;e the demand of &s;urrender, was not founded on a tie of con&s;anguinity? becau&s;e an uncle, a brother, a father, a &s;on, were not impri&s;oned? This, &s;urely, is not a legal idea of particularity. But all the law regards is to be found in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. The party a&s;&s;embled with a view to relea&s;e a particular &s;et of pri&s;oners, and not pri&s;oners generally. Shankweiler was one who was there; three or four came with him to &s;ee that he &s;hould not be u&s;ed ill, and to offer bail for him. What was their language at the bridge? "They have taken our <HI>neighbours;</HI> but if they have done wrong, they ought to be tried in their own county." That they &s;hould be tran&s;ported to Philadelphia was the great objection&mdash;was the motive to the re&s;cue: that they have been tran&s;ported to Philadelphia, is a great inconvenience, is the principal difficulty in the defence.</P>
<P>Thus, then, in point of proof the pro&s;ecution is defective: it is not merely an act of violence, but a traitorous intention that mu&s;t be &s;hown at the place where the violence was committed. No &s;uch intention has appeared in evidence; while on the contrary we have pointed you to the parts of the evidence which prove that the people did every thing that they intended to do, and the moment they obtained their object, di&s;per&s;ed. With this view of the &s;ubject, why does the government pro&s;ecute for a capital offence? If this pri&s;oner is acquitted on the pre&s;ent indictment, there is no probability of his e&s;caping with impunity: though his life may be &s;pared; there is no doubt but the attorney of the di&s;trict, will pre&s;ent a bill again&s;t him under the act to which I have &s;o repeatedly referred.</P>
<P>On the principle of the law that I have &s;tated, 'till the overt act is compleatly proved in Northampton, the intention as well as the deed, I
<PB N="102" REF="037104_0106_100D8507B1B9ACE0">
take it you cannot go to another county for evidence, by proving there an independant and &s;ub&s;tantive act of trea&s;on. It is immaterial to Fries, as it re&s;pects this charge, what he did in the county of Bucks. He met at Kline's: and though I will deny the impropriety of his conduct at that meeting, no lawyer will a&s;&s;ert that it amounted to trea&s;on. He did not meet at Mitchel's; but wherever he did attend, we cannot perceive any thing in his conduct, but a vague di&s;like of the land tax, and a &s;teady re|gard for the &s;afety of the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. It is immaterial what he did, and what he &s;aid, in the county of Bucks: the offence mu&s;t be proved in all its parts in the county of Northampton.</P>
<P>And here, gentlemen, I am naturally led to guard you again&s;t another in&s;trument in the &s;y&s;tem of &s;tate pro&s;ecutions, called accumulative trea&s;on, as dangerous and as unju&s;t an in&s;trument as con&s;tructive trea&s;on, of which I have already &s;poken. Accumulative trea&s;on, is, the artful combination of a number of circum&s;tances, which in their original, unconnected &s;itua|tion were unimportant, but being thus combined become gigantic, and frightful to the eye. Mere indi&s;cretions committed at different times, in different places, and under various impul&s;es, collected into a ma&s;s, and ex|hibited at a moment, may be made to a&s;&s;ume the complexion of the mo&s;t odious crimes. None of the acts committed out of Northampton ought to be brought into the account again&s;t the pri&s;oner, till, at lea&s;t, the act of trea&s;on has been proved, legally proved, to have been committed there. For tho&s;e extraneous acts, if they do not amount to &s;ub&s;tantive acts of trea&s;on, indictable where they were committed, he may be rendered re&s;|pon&s;ible under the &s;edition law, or under the general law again&s;t rioters. If his actions in another county ought not to be taken into view, the rea&s;on is &s;tronger for excluding his words. Words &s;poken may be an high mi&s;demeanour, but can never amount to trea&s;on. 4 Black Com. 259. and yet it is attempted to prove the pre&s;ent charge by the aid of loo&s;e, equi|vocal, and ambiguous conver&s;ations. With re&s;pect to &s;uch evidence, ari&s;ing under circum&s;tances that are not clearly &s;tated, communicated with|out regard to the order and connection of facts, and depending on the memory of per&s;ons agitated by terror, or by re&s;entment, can it be nece&s;|&s;ary to caution an upright and enlightened jury? Take them, if you will, the language of the law declares that they cannot con&s;titute trea&s;on; but the language of humanity in&s;tructs you totally to di&s;regard them.</P>
<P>Let me advert to another circum&s;tance with re&s;pect to the evidence. It is not nece&s;&s;ary laboriou&s;ly to di&s;tingui&s;h what is hear&s;ay evidence and what is not: and I admit that the te&s;timony, which applies to a de&s;crip|tion of the general &s;tate of the country, is not to be di&s;regarded, becau&s;e it is of the nature of hear&s;ay. Upon the detail, however, of &s;pecific facts, the rule is &s;trict and beneficial. Whatever was heard from a &s;econd per|&s;on, when that per&s;on might him&s;elf have been brought as a witne&s;s; or whatever has pa&s;&s;ed in relation to the pri&s;oner, at a time when he was ab|&s;ent; the law will not allow to be the foundation of a verdict upon the pre&s;ent trial. Included in this de&s;cription is every piece of information, all the tittle tattle, that pa&s;&s;ed between the &s;ubordinate and principal a&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ors or commi&s;&s;ioners. Again: the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors told the commi&s;&s;ioners that the law could not be executed; but this is matter of opinion, which mu&s;t be founded on facts; and you mu&s;t take the facts, not the opinion, as your guide. Nor can a corre&s;pondence official or unofficial, between pub|lic
<PB N="103" REF="037104_0107_100D850943CE6938">
officers, be e&s;timated as evidence on the trial of a third per&s;on. If it can be e&s;timated as evidence, then it will be always in the power of the officers of government, to fabricate and produce evidence that will inevi|tably convict an obnoxious individual. God forbid that ever this &s;hould be the ca&s;e here; but the temptations to an abu&s;e of power are not want|ing. Without meaning a reflection upon Mr. Eyerly, it cannot be over|looked, that he, who was the commi&s;&s;ioner for executing the unpopular law, had been recently an un&s;ucce&s;sful candidate for Congre&s;s; and if a ba&s;e motive could actuate him, do we not perceive his opportunity, to avenge the defeat upon the active opponents of his election? Official re|ports are nece&s;&s;ary to maintain the connection between officers of different grades;&mdash;the facts &s;tated in them are binding upon the reporters, and the reports are them&s;elves &s;ufficient evidence to be acted upon by the officers to whom they are made: but was it ever tolerated, was it ever conceived, that an official &s;tatement of facts &s;hould be conclu&s;ive in any ca&s;e, even in a ca&s;e of property, affecting the rights of a private citizen, in a court of ju&s;tice. The facts depend upon books and vouchers, con&s;tituting an of|ficial record, and the books and vouchers, or authenticated copies, or ex|emplifications, can alone be admitted as legal evidence upon a trial at law.</P>
<P>There remains another point of law, to be introduced to the notice of the court and jury. I take it for granted, that no man can be &s;aid to oppo&s;e a law, unle&s;s the law exi&s;ts; no man can oppo&s;e a mea&s;ure of government, unle&s;s his acquie&s;cence is lawfully required. The judges will not view my po&s;ition in the mi&s;taken light which Mr. Attor|ney did, that the commi&s;&s;ion of every officer from the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or to the Pre&s;ident mu&s;t be produced, before any act in execution of the land tax law could be performed: No, Sir; I contend not for &s;o extravagant a, doctrine: but I a&s;&s;ert, that every man who re&s;i&s;ts a public officer de facto, and in con&s;equence of the re&s;i&s;tance is indicted, has a legal, &s;ettled right to demand upon his trial, proof of the authority of the officer. In the fir&s;t in&s;tance, the party who re&s;i&s;ts, does it at his peril;&mdash;but if the per&s;on claiming to act as an officer, had no warrant, or commi&s;&s;ion, the re&s;i&s;tance was ju&s;tifiable, and the defendant mu&s;t be acquitted. Let us apply this principle. The law being enacted by congre&s;s, it is an inconte&s;table, though &s;ometimes har&s;h rule, that ignorance, &s;hall be no excu&s;e for di&s;obeying it: but &s;uppo&s;e that a man, calling him&s;elf an a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or &s;hould come into my hou&s;e, and in&s;i&s;t on going from room to room to take the rates, without &s;hewing me his warrant; and that in con&s;equence of his refu&s;al I &s;hould turn him out, and he &s;hould pro&s;ecute me;&mdash;what is the re&s;ult? If he was <HI>de jure</HI> an officer, I am liable to the penalty of the act; but if he was not, then I am not only innocent, but entitled to an action of tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t him for his intru&s;ion.</P>
<P>We have, with this view of the ca&s;e, repeatedly called for proof of the appointments of the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, in conformity to the act of Congre&s;s. Such ap|pointments could only be legally made by a majority of the board of com|mi&s;&s;ioners for the divi&s;ion, at a regular meeting. Now, as the evidence proves, that one of the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors was not &s;o appointed; and that bundles of blank warrants were left in the hands of each commi&s;&s;ioner, to be filled up with any names he plea&s;ed; which ta&s;k in one in&s;tance a commi&s;&s;ioner a&s;&s;igned to an a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; &s;ufficient is &s;hewn to ju&s;tify our exacting on a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pital trial, the be&s;t evidence of regular appointments, that the ca&s;e will
<PB N="104" REF="037104_0108_100D850ACF195F28">
admit: the b&eacute;&s;t, the only evidence, is the record of the commi&s;&s;ioners, which the law directs to be kept by the clerk of the board. There can indeed, be no room to ju&s;tify the transfer of the di&s;cretion and authority ve&s;ted in the commi&s;&s;ioners by Congre&s;s: it is not like the common ca&s;e of blank certificates, to authenticate, mini&s;terially, the &s;ignature of a magi&s;|trate, notary, &amp;c. which, I as a public officer have often filled up on be|half of the Governor: but it is the ca&s;e of a di&s;cretion, ari&s;ing from the judgment, information, and integrity of the party, who is confidentially appointed to exerci&s;e it;&mdash;&s;uch a di&s;cretion as is ve&s;ted in the Governor to appoint Judges, of which he could not have transferred to me, in the &s;hape of blank commi&s;&s;ions, without, I believe, expo&s;ing both of us to the jeopardy of impeachment.</P>
<P N="2">2. Having thus delivered my &s;entiments upon the points of law, that ari&s;e on the evidence, I &s;hall now enter upon the con&s;ideration of the &s;e|cond propo&s;ition,&mdash;<Q>the general &s;tate of the di&s;contents in the northern counties; and how far the re&s;cue at Bethlehem was connected with the previous di&s;turbances.</Q></P>
<P>And here I find, gentlemen, that the &s;ource, from which proceeds much if not all, of our political good, di&s;charges, likewi&s;e, much, if not all of our political evil: I mean the bu&s;ine&s;s of elections. You will recollect the te&s;timony of Mr. Hor&s;efield.</P>
<P>That gentleman, when he wi&s;hed to give you a de&s;cription of the ori|gin of all the mi&s;chief that we deprecate, pointed his finger emphatically, at the election of 1798. Now, I pray that I may not be mi&s;under&s;tood in the progre&s;s I &s;hall make through the &s;cene which is thus di&s;clo&s;ed; let it not be &s;uppo&s;ed, that I am depraved enough to ju&s;tify the mi&s;conduct that has been exhibited; becau&s;e I am firm enough to contend, that it did not proceed from motives directed to Trea&s;on, nor lead to con&s;equences that amount to Trea&s;on. At the eve of our election, it is natural for the citizens of a free country, to canva&s;s what has been done by the public agents; to applaud the good, and reprobate the bad: and in doing this they exerci&s;e a right; nay, they perform a duty. No intelligible and candid man will &s;ay that the con&s;titution of a repre&s;entative republic can be pre&s;erved in a vigorous and healthy &s;tate, unle&s;s the people, from whom it denies its vital principle, are vigilant and virtuous in the exerci&s;e of the elective franchi&s;e. For this purpo&s;e they retain the right of opinion; and though they may u&s;e it upon mi&s;taken, or erroneous grounds, if they u&s;e it fairly and peaceably, there is no power to controul or ob&s;truct them.</P>
<P>I a&s;k, then, what were the o&s;ten&s;ible cau&s;es of di&s;content? They will be delineated by the oppo&s;ite council as &s;pectres of the mo&s;t vi&s;ionary, yet mo&s;t horrible a&s;pect; but notwith&s;tanding any &s;incere abhorrence of the manner in which the di&s;content has been manife&s;ted, I cannot admit that the cau&s;es did not afford a legal ground for exerci&s;ing the right of opini|on. For in&s;tance, the alien and Sedition laws. They are a novelty in this country, and their novelty might alone attract the popular attention and di&s;plea&s;ure. But were the inhabitants of the northern counties of Penn&s;ylvania the only di&s;&s;atisfied citizens? Peru&s;e the debates, examine the files of Congre&s;s, and you will find the mo&s;t pointed declarations of the public opinion, the mo&s;t unequivocal marks of di&s;&s;atisfaction, through|out the United States. Exerci&s;ing the right of opinion, the people di&s;|approved the laws, and the law makers. Exerci&s;ing the right of Elec|tion

they endeavoured to promote the &s;ucce&s;s of tho&s;e candidates, who would regularly procure a repeal of the laws. Again: the &s;tamp act was &s;trongly objected to, and produced the nick name of "Stamplers," which was applied generally to the friends of government. Now, in my opinion, there cannot be a more convenient mode of taxation than an impo&s;ition on &s;tamps; but that was not the opinion of the people of Northampton and Bucks. They had imbibed a prejudice again&s;t a &s;tamp act in the year 1775, and not con&s;idering properly the ground of American oppo&s;iti|on to the tyranny of taxation without repre&s;entation, they confounded the name with the principle of the law. I repeat that I do not agree with them, but I contend that they had a right to &s;peak freely on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Again. The hou&s;e tax was objected to; not from the real, but from the imaginary burdens which it impo&s;ed; for if it had been intended to devi&s;e a tax for the relief of the poor, at the co&s;t of the rich, for the be|nefit of the country at the expence of the city, there could not, I think, be a more ingenious plan than the pre&s;ent law exhibits. The oppo&s;ition mu&s;t evidently, therefore, have ari&s;en from mi&s;conception, or mi&s;informa|tion. But if their opinion of the law was &s;incere, however erroneous, it is entitled to indulgence. The fallibility of the human under&s;tanding, and the frailty of our pa&s;&s;ions, mu&s;t be re&s;pected in every wi&s;e and bene|volent &s;y&s;tem of politics, or law. A man who hone&s;tly acts under a fal&s;e impre&s;&s;ion of facts, may be pitied as a weak man, but he ought not to be puni&s;hed as a wicked one. Then, the rioters were under an evident delu&s;ion, as to the principle of the land tax, the purity of the government, and the compen&s;ation of public officers. They had not the ordinary ac|ce&s;s to information, &s;ince our laws are publi&s;hed in Engli&s;h, and mo&s;t of them only under&s;tood German: and this being a que&s;tion of property, they acted upon the fir&s;t blind impul&s;e of their avarice, proving the truth of Mr. Hor&s;efield's ob&s;ervation, "that the Germans are fond of their money, and do not like to part with it." But &s;till there is a criterion which in applying a rule of law ought always to be regarded:&mdash;I mean the moral character, and mental attainments, of the men who are ar|raigned. If a di&s;content exi&s;ts, we cannot fairly expect the &s;ame mode of expre&s;&s;ing it, from illiterate, uncultivated men, the &s;cattered inhabi|tants of a remote di&s;trict, that we may rea&s;onably exact from men of edu|cation and manners, formed by the luxury and refinements of a metropo|lis: The&s;e will take care, if they do expre&s;s their di&s;contents, to avoid per&s;onal indignity, and legal embarra&s;&s;ments; while tho&s;e, without &s;kill to a&s;certain the limits of the law, as without delicacy to re&s;pect the invi|olability of the per&s;on, rarely act without being riotous, or complain with|out being abu&s;ive. Plain men, then, have but plain ways to manife&s;t what they feel; and they ought not to be tried and condemned by a more perfect, and generally, a more artificial &s;tandard. A di&s;turbance &s;imilar to the one under con&s;ideration is not uncommon in England; but the go|vernment, in&s;tead of entering pro&s;ecutions again&s;t the di&s;contented, for trea&s;on, has &s;ometimes thought it proper to acquie&s;ce in the wi&s;hes of the people. We all remember the popular influence in depriving Lord North of the reins of government. The attempt of a mini&s;ter (Mr. Pitt) to involve that nation in a war with Ru&s;&s;ia, was a very unpopular mea|&s;ure; murmurs and complaints reverberated through the kingdom, and, finally, he was obliged to abandon his project The &s;hop tax was
<PB N="106" REF="037104_0110_100D8511DE9B0988">
&s;anctioned by all the branches of the Parliament; but it generated cla|mours &s;o loud and &s;o acrimonious, riots &s;o numerous and &s;o outrageous, re&s;i&s;tance to lawful authority &s;o daring and &s;o injurious, that the govern|ment it&s;elf might ju&s;tly be &s;aid to be a&s;&s;ailed; and the act of parliament to be repealed by force and intimidation; yet, not a &s;ingle indictment for high trea&s;on was projected. Hence it is that I think ri&s;ings of the peo|ple, like the pre&s;ent &s;hould be viewed with the determination to puni&s;h, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> account of delinquency, but, al&s;o, with the di&s;po&s;ition to mitigate on account of prejudice, or ignorance. In a country where party &s;pirit beats high, there &s;hould be peculiar caution on the &s;ubject: For, even in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, has not the joy te&s;tified by the triumphant majority at the late election, been cla&s;&s;ed with the &s;ymptoms of popular di&s;content and ho&s;tility to the government? Nor will it be denied that there actually did ari&s;e in the minds of the people a &s;erious doubt, whether the law was in exi&s;tence or not; and although, I repeat, that ignorance is not a legal ex|cu&s;e, yet you mu&s;t take into view the &s;tate of information, before you can a&s;certain the degree of guilt. Under this ignorance, in this &s;tate of doubt, can the refu&s;al to permit the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors to enter a particular town|&s;hip, be con&s;trued into a fixed and deliberate intention of levying war a|gain&s;t the government? Though the law had been enacted, we find that the &s;ubject of the law had been brought anew before Congre&s;s, and peti|tions were &s;ent in abundance praying for a repeal. The&s;e di&s;contented people might have &s;uppo&s;ed that a repeal was effected, or intended; though we, who were at the &s;eat of government, knew the object of the revi&s;ion was merely to amend, and not to re&s;cind the law. At the meeting at Kline's (acting, probably, under the mi&s;take that I have &s;ugge&s;ted) there was an expre&s;s declaration, that the people did not think the law was in force at that time: And here let me remark, that the pri&s;oner, who is called the great parent of the di&s;contents, was not pre&s;ent at Kline's, which appears to have been the fir&s;t &s;tep in the oppo&s;ition to the land tax. Such was the &s;tate of information at that period. Mr. Hor&s;efield has &s;aid that there were general di&s;contents prevailing throughout the country: but his allegation is too vague, too comprehen&s;ive, to be under&s;tood or acted upon. The citizens of a free government have a right, if they ap|prehend that a violation of their con&s;titution is intended, or if they think that any encroachment is made on the bulwarks of liberty, or property, to expre&s;s their opinion; but is it practicable &s;o to expre&s;s that opinion as not to encounter from their political opponents the charge of di&s;content and &s;edition? How, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, was the popular di&s;content expre&s;&s;ed? At fir&s;t petitions to the government were propo&s;ed, framed and &s;ub&s;cribed. This was the re&s;ult of Kline's meeting; and in this, I pre|&s;ume, no ho&s;tility, no levying war, can be di&s;covered. At every &s;ub&s;e|quent meeting, whether convened by the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, or by the people them|&s;elves, the reliance on legi&s;lative redre&s;s was never abandoned; though, it is true there was great intemperance of manner and of language. The a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors were &s;ometimes interrupted in their journies, and &s;ometimes jo&s;t|led in the croud; and the unmeaning epithets of <HI>Stamplers</HI> and <HI>Tories,</HI> were rudely applied to the friends of government. But however cen&s;ura|ble, where is the trea&s;on in &s;uch proceedings? A rioter and a traitor are not &s;ynonimous characters; and let us &s;ay what we plea&s;e about nick-names and &s;lander, the &s;ociety that patiently &s;ubmits to the &s;currility of the Phi|ladelphia

new&s;papers, will never be di&s;gu&s;ted or enraged at the indecorum or vulgarity of the northern in&s;urgents. But the in&s;urgents went further; they <HI>intimidated</HI> the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors: and is that trea&s;on? No; it is the very gi&s;t of the offence for which the &s;edition act explicitly provides. Is it not the very phra&s;e of that aft, that if any per&s;ons &s;hall combine to intimidate an officer from the performance of his duty, he &s;hall be deemed guilty of a high mi&s;demeanour, and be puni&s;hed with fine and impri&s;onment? Now let us go &s;tep by &s;tep through the evidence, and I defy the mo&s;t inqui&s;iti|onal ingenuity to di&s;cover any thing beyond the de&s;ign, and the effect, of a &s;y&s;tem of intimidation. Is there any actual force re&s;orted to? No! I find the bridle of one a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or &s;eized, and his leg laid hold of; but the man is not pulled of his hor&s;e, nor is he the lea&s;t injured in his per&s;on. I find that a witne&s;s thinks that he heard the word " fire" given, and that he &s;aw two men from a neighbouring porch, pre&s;ent their rifles at another a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or: well, did the riflemen fire? No. They had guns; their guns were probably, loaded; and if any thing more than intimidation was me|ditated, how &s;hall we account for their not firing? But we hear a great deal of the per&s;onal jeopardy of the commi&s;&s;ioners and a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors; and yet who of them &s;u&s;tained an injury? Mr. Chapman, Mr. Foulke, and Mr. Childs are, generally &s;peaking, treated as men of merit and con&s;ideration; and, in particular wherever the pri&s;oner met them, they were re&s;pected and protected; as at Jacob Fries's and Robert's taverns. To repel the plea for favour founded on &s;uch correct department towards the officers, we &s;hall be told, that the pri&s;oner was an artful man, that he was the leader; and it will be &s;trongly urged again&s;t him, that he called on the officers to &s;ur|render the public papers. Of his conduct as a leader, I &s;hall &s;peak here|after; and of his demand of the papers, it is &s;urely &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that in oppo&s;ition to the &s;en&s;e of the rioters, and at the ri&s;que of his life, he returned the papers, privately, in the &s;ame &s;tate in which he had receiv|ed them.</P>
<P>Having &s;poken of the A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, I would wi&s;h, likewi&s;e, to review the evidence with re&s;pect to Mr. Eyrely, the commi&s;&s;ioner, and Col. Nichols, the mar&s;hal.</P>
<P>[Here Mr. Dallas entered into an inve&s;tigation of the evidence, to &s;hew, that although the people acted violently at the &s;everal meetings which Mr. Eyerly had called to explain the law to them: that although Mr. Eyerly accompanied the mar&s;hal in his whole progre&s;s for &s;erving proce&s;s, and that although he was con&s;picuou&s;ly pre&s;ent at Bethlehem, no per&s;onal violence was ever offered to him, or to the mar&s;hal; and all the ill-treatment they encountered, amounted to no more than an attempt to intimidate them, but which they both declared was without effect. Mr. Dallas then continued as follows.]</P>
<P>And are we to be to told, Sir, that the&s;e acts without force, without any apparent object but to intimidate the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of a particular di&s;trict; that di&s;trict acts of incon&s;iderate riot and folly &s;hall, when connected and com|bined, con&s;titute a deliberate trea&s;on, by levying war again&s;t the United States If no trea&s;on was actually perpetrated, if none was intended, when the tran&s;|actions occurred I in&s;i&s;t, that nothing previous to them, nothing <HI>ex post facto,</HI> can make the pri&s;oner a traitor; the intention <HI>at the time</HI> mu&s;t have been trea&s;onable; or the act can never be puni&s;hed as trea&s;on.</P>
<P>Let us now, however, proceed to enquire into the circum&s;tances of the
<PB N="108" REF="037104_0112_100D8516695B6318">
re&s;cue at Bethlehem, and its connection with the previous di&s;turbances. I think the evidence is &s;trong in &s;upport of the a&s;&s;ertion, that the &s;ole, in|dependent, con&s;ummate object of the a&s;&s;embling of the people at that place, was to re&s;cue the&s;e pri&s;oners. Is there any &s;atisfactory proof of a combination between the people of Northampton and of Bucks? I know that an expre&s;&s;ion is &s;aid to have e&s;caped the Pri&s;oner, that, in this gene|ral di&s;content with re&s;pect to the land tax, certain per&s;ons of a part of Northampton would join the inhabitants of Lower Milford: but let the foundation of his opinions be te&s;ted by the facts, and it evidently a|ro&s;e, not from negociation, con&s;piracy and compact, (as the pro&s;ecution &s;uppo&s;es) but from a general knowledge, which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in common with thou&s;ands, that the land tax was unpopular throughout the adjacent country. It is enough, however, for the defence, that no combination, or corre&s;pondence, is proved; &s;ince the rule declares, that in legal con|templation, what does not appear, and what does not exi&s;t, are the &s;ame. You do not find the people of Bucks attending any meetings but in their own county; nor entering into the county of Northampton at all previ|ou&s;ly to their appearance at Bethlehem.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, it might &s;urely be expected, that a concerted in&s;urrection for trea&s;onable purpo&s;es, prevailing throughout the three counties of Bucks Northampton and Montgomery, and cemented by common intere&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions, would have been in&s;pired and conducted by one common council: but is there the &s;lighted proof of &s;uch a co-operation? I am aware of the communication made by Captain Staeler to the &s;on of Conrad Marks; but the communication it&s;elf was merely accidental; and amounts to no|thing more than the reque&s;t of one individual of Northampton to an individual of Bucks. I am aware, likewi&s;e, that a me&s;&s;age was received at Quaker town (as one of the witne&s;&s;es &s;ays) mentioning the arre&s;t of the Northampton pri&s;oners, and inviting the people of Bucks to a&s;&s;i&s;t in re&s;cu|ing them. Who brought this me&s;&s;age, and to whom it was delivered, I don't recollect; but it &s;eems, that a compliance was re&s;olved on; and a paper expre&s;&s;ing the re&s;olution, was prepared and &s;igned by Fries, with a number of other per&s;ons. But was the object of the invitation, or of the re&s;olution to comply with it, trea&s;on, or re&s;cue;&mdash;to commit a riot, or to levy war again&s;t the United States? I repeat, that the &s;ole, indepen|dant, and exclu&s;ive purpo&s;e was to re&s;cue a particular &s;et of Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>Now, if in the previous part of this tran&s;action, nothing has &s;truck your minds as traitorous in the acts, or the intention of the people, I beg you to follow me, gentlemen, with &s;trict attention to a con&s;ideration of the object that was actually effected, and the means of effecting it. The object was to obtain a re&s;cue; a re&s;cue was effected, but it was effected with circum&s;tances of military array: will this alter the original charac|ter of the riot? No, &s;ir:&mdash;If the people did not repair to Bethlehem with a traitorous intention, their arms and military equipments will not convert them into traitors. As on the one hand, I grant, that the circum|&s;tance of military array is not nece&s;&s;ary to an act of trea&s;on, if the, intenti|on is traitorous, &s;o I in&s;i&s;t, on the other hand, that the circum&s;tance of military array will not con&s;titute trea&s;on, without &s;uch intention.</P>
<P>[Here Mr. Dallas entered into an inve&s;tigation of the evidence in re|lation to the a&s;&s;embling of the people, their march to Bethlehem, an their conduct there. In the cour&s;e of the detail he endeavoured to e&s;tab|li&s;h,
<PB N="109" REF="037104_0113_100D851817DD2D38">
that the &s;ole object of the rioters was to re&s;cue the pri&s;oner; that no injury was offered, or intended again&s;t the mar&s;hal, the commi&s;&s;ioners, the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, or the po&s;&s;e comitatis; and that although the pri&s;oner was forced into a con&s;picuous &s;tation among the rioters, his conduct had been marked with civility towards the public officers, and a &s;olicitude to avoid the effu&s;ion of blood. On the la&s;t of the&s;e points, Mr. Dallas concluded as follows:</P>
<P>And here permit me to remark, that if the conduct of John Fries was &s;uch as to ju&s;tify his being &s;elected as a &s;ubject for capital puni&s;hment, I cannot &s;ee the policy or ju&s;tice of the &s;election; nor forbear from depre|cating the con&s;equences of the precedent. A good man may &s;ometimes affect to join a mob, with a view to acquire and to exerci&s;e an influence in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing it: or an intelligent and temperate man may, for a while, be a&s;&s;ociated for an illicit purpo&s;e, with a furious and ignorant rabble, who ill naturally look up to him as a leader: but in either ca&s;e, the power and the di&s;po&s;ition to avert, or to limit outrage, will be dangerous to the prominent individual who di&s;plays them; and his only &s;afety is in mingling with the crowd, whatever may be the direction or the deva&s;tation of the &s;torm!</P>
<P>Gentlemen of the jury, I have now gone through two of the general propo&s;itions, into which I divided the con&s;ideration of the defence; and, in the cour&s;e of my ob&s;ervations, I have anticipated much that related to the third propor&s;ition&mdash;the particular conduct of the pri&s;oner. I &s;hould here, therefore, break off, as I feel that my &s;trength, and I fear that your patience are exhau&s;ted: but that the proclamation of the Pre&s;ident de|mands a moment's further attention. By the laws of the United States it is provided, that, under certain circum&s;tances, the Pre&s;ident may call out the militia to &s;uppre&s;s an in&s;urrection, having previou&s;ly publi&s;hed a pro|clamation, requiring the in&s;urgents to di&s;per&s;e. This proclamation is ob|viou&s;ly in the nature of an admonition; and if the admonition produces the effect, I a&s;k, whether in the pre&s;ent, as in every other ca&s;e, it ought not to produce impunity? Then I argue, on general principles, that if the rioters did peaceably retire to their homes upon this authoritative warn|ing, they ought to be &s;heltered from puni&s;hment for any offence previou&s;ly committed. Nor is the argument without a &s;anction from the po&s;itive authorities of the law. 1 Hale 138: And the court will recollect, that the principle is incorporated into the &s;tatute, which is u&s;ually called in England, the riot act. There mu&s;t &s;urely, be &s;ome object in requiring the Pre&s;ident to i&s;&s;ue his proclamation; and the one which I &s;ugge&s;t is equally benevolent and politic. On the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion it produced an immediate and deci&s;ive obedience to the laws. Be&s;ides when we recollect, that the Pre&s;ident has the power to pardon offences, to di&s;continue pro&s;e|cutions, and to grant a general amne&s;ty, as in the ca&s;e of the we&s;tern in&s;ur|rection; why may we not con&s;ider the proclamation as emanating from that attribute of mercy, &s;ince no &s;pecific formula is pre&s;cribed, by which its exerci&s;e &s;hall be expre&s;&s;ed, or announced?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Judge Iredell interrupted Mr. Dallas, observing that he thought it ir|regular to make any use of the proclamation as a pardon, without pleading it. Mr. Dallas said, that he only meant to infer from the facts of the warning and the dispersion, that the insurgents never meditated treason.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="037104_0114_100D851C14637B80">
Mr. Dallas then proceeded to point out the differences in the nature, progre&s;s and turpitude of the Northampton in&s;urrection, and of the we&s;tern in&s;urrection: 2 Dallas'a reports 349, and analy&s;ing again the ca&s;e of lord George Gordon, he contended that upon that authority alone, the pri&s;oner ought to be acquitted. In the ca&s;e of lord Gordon, the direct, the avow|ed object, was to obtain the repeal of a law; and as petitions and remon|&s;trances were unavailing, a body of 40,000 men were convened and mar|&s;halled to &s;urround, intimidate, and coerce the Parliament. Riot, ar&s;on, murder, and every &s;pecies of the mo&s;t daring outrage and deva&s;tation, en|&s;ued; and yet, the only pro&s;ecution for high trea&s;on was in&s;tituted again&s;t the leader of the a&s;&s;ociation; and that pro&s;ecution terminated in an ac|quittal. View, then, the riots of lord George Gordon in their origin; e&s;timate their guilt by the avowed object; aggravate the &s;cene with the cotemporaneous in&s;ults and violence offered to the per&s;ons of peers and commoners; and clo&s;e the retro&s;pect with the horrors which the Briti&s;h metropolis endured for more than eight days; and then &s;ay, (exclaimed Mr. Dallas) what was the guilt of John Fries compared with the guilt of lord George Gordon;&mdash;what is there in the Engli&s;h doctrine of trea&s;on that has ju&s;tified an acquittal of the latter;&mdash;what is there in the Ameri|can doctrine of trea&s;on, that will ju&s;tify a conviction of the former?</P>
<P>Gentlemen: I can proceed no longer. The life of the pri&s;oner is left, with great confidence, in your hands. There are attempts to make him re&s;pon&s;ible under the notion of a general con&s;piracy, for all the actions and all the words of meetings, which he never attended, and of per|&s;ons whom he never &s;aw. But this is too, too har&s;h, in a ca&s;e of blood; It is incon&s;i&s;tent with the humanity, the tenderne&s;s of life, which are cha|racteri&s;tics of the American people, and e&s;pecially of the people of Penn|&s;ylvania. Nor is it called for by the policy, or practice, of tho&s;e who admini&s;ter our government. I believe that to the chief magi&s;trate, to every public officer, to every candid citizen, it will be matter of a gratifi|cation, if after &s;o fair, &s;o full a &s;crutiny, you &s;hould be of opinion, that trea&s;on has not been committed. Such an event will by no means en&s;ure impunity to the delinquent; for, though he has not committed trea&s;on, though the puni&s;hment of death is not to be inflicted; the violation of the laws may be amply avenged upon an indictment of a different nature. The only que&s;tion, however, now to be decided is, whether the offence proved, is like the offence charged, trea&s;on again&s;t the United States. The affirmation mu&s;t be inconte&s;tably e&s;tabli&s;hed, as to the fact and the inten|tion, by the te&s;timony of two witne&s;&s;es to the &s;ame overt act: but remem|ber, I pray you, what the venerable lord Mansfield &s;tated to the jury on lord Gordon's trial,&mdash;remember, that it is enough for us, in defence of the pri&s;oner, to rai&s;e a doubt; for, if you doubt (it is the principle of law, as well as of humanity) you mu&s;t acquit.</P>

<P> Sometime after la&s;t February court, John Fries came to my hou&s;e; I had heard, on my way coming to Newtown, that there was to be a meeting at Kline's. I a&s;ked him whether there was many people there, and what they had done. He told me there was, and they had agreed not to allow the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments to be made in the town&s;hip as yet; he &s;aid the rea&s;on was, becau&s;e they did not know whether there was a law pa&s;&s;ed on it or not; I told him I really believed there was, for though I had not &s;een it my&s;elf, I had heard of it. He likewi&s;e told me that Mitchel had undertaken to draw up an in&s;trument of writing, but he could not go through with it, and that he called upon him to a&s;&s;i&s;t him to do it, which he did.&mdash;On the 6th of March, I had occa&s;ion to go to the town|&s;hip meeting on account of a pauper which was likely to become charge|able, calling at Jacob Fries's, I had been there but a &s;hort time, before a parcel of men came there, &s;ome with arms, and &s;ome without. They called for liquor, freely. They then proceeded to make enquiry whether any body knew whether the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors were going about the town&s;hip or not: I do not know whether they got any information or no, but they agreed to go up to Quaker town; after they were gone a little while, Jacob Fries and I concluded that we would ride up after them: we went to the hou&s;e of Enoch Roberts. We went into a room, but nothing oc|curred there, and I then a&s;ked Jacob Fries if he would ride down to Da|niel Penro&s;e's: after we had been there &s;ome &s;hort time, one of the fami|ly told us that our hor&s;es were getting loo&s;e, &s;o we went out, and there we &s;aw Mr. Rodrick, who halted; he appeared to be much frightened; &s;o I a&s;ked him what was the matter, he told me they had catched Foulke and Childs, and that he was afraid they would kill them, and in&s;i&s;ted on my going back to try to prevent them being hurt: I told him I would not, except he would too; he &s;aid he would if I would engage they &s;hould not hurt him; I told him I would not do that, for I did not know what they had again&s;t him. However, at his de&s;ire I went to town, and when I got there, I think I was told they had Foulke in the &s;table; &s;o I rode up, and called him by name, and I think he an&s;wered me. At my de&s;ire, he came into the hou&s;e: while we were walking along, I told him it was a pity he &s;hould a&s;&s;e&s;s the town&s;hip till they were more reconciled: I told him I thought the be&s;t way to quiet the people, was to &s;hew them the &s;mall a&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ments he had made, and promi&s;e not to go about again till they were &s;atisfied. He &s;aid he was willing to do that. We then walked into the room, and &s;oon after we were there, Conrad Marks walked towards us with a kind of &s;word in his hand, though I believe &s;heathed, and &s;aid to Foulke " What, I hear you are going about this bu&s;ine&s;s again; did not I tell you not to do this bu&s;ine&s;s, but I cannot tell you in Engli&s;h like as I could in Dutch; but it is for the &s;ake of tho&s;e few dollars that you go about this bu&s;ine&s;s." Foulke an&s;wered him that he did not do it for the &s;ake of the money. Marks an&s;wered, " did I not tell you that it you could not do without, come to my hou&s;e and I would keep you four or five days; but if you had to do this for half a crown a day, the devil would not &s;end you about the town&s;hip. I then told Marks what I had advi&s;ed Foulke: he &s;aid if he would do that, he would u&s;e him like a gentleman. Then the affair of Captain Seaborne<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Thomas's testimony.</HI></NOTE> took place, which &s;eem|ed
<PB N="112" REF="037104_0116_100D85200394D308">
to draw the attention from Mr. Foulke. I &s;aw John Fries looking over &s;ome papers, but I did not know what they were, I went away.&mdash;</P>
<P>A day or two after the affair at Bethlehem, John Fries came to me and told me the circum&s;tances, much the &s;ame as was related by the mar|&s;hal to the be&s;t of my knowledge: he then &s;aid he did not know what to do with the&s;e Germans, for that they had got it grafted in them that general Wa&s;hington was oppo&s;ed to this law, and that, &s;o poor a man as he was, he would not grudge half the expence of a man to go and get his opinion on purpo&s;e to &s;atisfy the Germans. The next knowledge I got about it, was from two gentlemen who came from Philadelphia in order to carry the proclamation about, and they gave me &s;ome proclamations, de&s;iring me to do all I could to get &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the laws. I &s;poke to many of them, and there was a meeting called at Marks's on the Monday following. There were 150 people or more there from the three counties. It was agreed by &s;everal people that it would be be&s;t to have men cho&s;en to form a committee, from the three counties, to con&s;ult what to do for the be&s;t. This was agreed to, and four men were cho&s;en from each coun|ty. I was one of four cho&s;en from Bucks, with George Kline, David Ro|berts, and Conrad Marks. Dr. Baker, '&s;quire Davis, and I think '&s;quire Jarrett were &s;ome. We unanimou&s;ly agreed to recommend to the people, as near as I can recollect, to de&s;i&s;t from oppo&s;ing any public officer in the execution of his office, and enjoined upon the citizens to u&s;e their influ|ence, to prevent any oppo&s;ition, and to give due &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the laws of the United States, dated 18th of March.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>Was there any oppo&s;ition at all when this was reported?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P>I did not hear any body but did con&s;ent to what was done by the committee. The people of lower Milford thought it would be nece&s;&s;ary to have the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments taken. David Roberts &s;aid that he believed Mr. Chapman would agree for them to appoint an a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or in their own town|&s;hip. It was then agreed that we &s;hould ride to him to know; which we did next day: he &s;aid he had once made the offer, but it was now out of his power. He then &s;aid Mr. Clark had been fir&s;t appointed, and that he had not yet given up his commi&s;&s;ion, and he did not know how another could be appointed now; that if Mr. Clark would go about it, it would an&s;wer the end. On returning home, I called at Frederick Henny's, and de&s;ired him to draw out &s;ome German adverti&s;ements, and &s;end them over towards Marks's, to de&s;ire the people to meet, and con&s;ent to let Clark go about. I believe he did it. At the time of appointment, the people met at Mitchel's, perhaps there were about 40 there. John Fries, and Fre|deric Henny were there. The people in general agreed to let Clark go about, I believe Fries and Henny did not vote. I went to Fries and a&s;k|ed the rea&s;on: he &s;aid he had no objection to the people voting for him, and he wi&s;hed it was done; but as he was fir&s;t oppo&s;ed to Clark going about the town&s;hip, he thought it would not be right in him to vote. I believe Henny &s;aid about the &s;ame.&mdash;I &s;aw Fries again a few days before he was taken: he told me he had heard a report which troubled him more than any thing in his life: I a&s;ked him what it was: he &s;aid that a report was in circulation that he was collecting up men to a&s;&s;i&s;t the French: he &s;aid, "da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the French, if they were now to come to invade this country, &s;o old a man as I am, I would venture my life again&s;t them; but I want no|thing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o do with them.</P>

<P> After the proclamation arrived in our neighbourhood, there was a &s;tatement in the next weeks' new&s;paper, &s;tating the conduct of John Fries, which I procured, and took to John Fries. After looking over the paper, he &s;eemed pretty &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, but &s;aid nothing: he appeared, I thought much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in his mind. I told him that I wanted to have &s;ome conver&s;ation with him, relative to it. I then a&s;ked him whether he had rightly con&s;idered this matter? whether he had not run him&s;elf into danger incon&s;iderately, and told him the con&s;equences as I thought might attend it. He &s;aid he never had con&s;idered it &s;o much as he had within a few days before. He &s;aid he had not &s;lept half an hour for three or four nights, and that he would give all he was worth in the world if the matter was all &s;ettled, and he clear of it: he likewi&s;e faid, if the government would &s;end for him, he would go with him, even if a little child was &s;ent.</P>

They came into the hou&s;e, and appeared to be very much oppo&s;ed to the law, and in a very bad humour. I propo&s;ed to read the law to them; they a&s;ked me how I came to adverti&s;e the meeting: I told him I did it with the con&s;ent of a few others: he a&s;ked me what bu&s;ine&s;s I had to do it: I told him we did it to explain the law. He looked me in the face and &s;aid, " We don't want any of your damned laws, we have laws of our own," and &s;hook the muzzle of his mu&s;quet in my face, &s;aying, " This is our law, and we will let you know it."&mdash;There were four or five who wi&s;hed to hear it, but others forbid it, and &s;aid it &s;hould not be read, and it was not done.</P>

<SPEAKER>WITNESS.</SPEAKER>
<P> AS I was coming from the hou&s;e of James Chapman with the other a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors (John Rodrick and Cephas Childs) when I came nearly oppo&s;ite Enoch Roberts's, I &s;aw the pri&s;oner at the Bar, and a number of others with their arms, (though I don't know that he had any, but the others had.) Some of them held them nearly as high as my hor&s;e's &s;ide, on a level, with their arms hanging down. I &s;poke to them as I pa&s;&s;ed and rode on till I got nearly to the other tavern, David Zellers's. When I got there, a number run out and cried "&s;top." Some of them addre&s;&s;|ing me by name, de&s;ired me to &s;top; which I did in a plea&s;ant manner. Before any of them got to me, I think John Fries came over from Ro|berts's; when he was about a rod from me, he called me by my name, and told me he had told me ye&s;terday that he would take me to day, and he was now come to do it, or it &s;hould now be done, I don't know which he &s;aid. Captain Kuyder then ran up, and &s;eized my hor&s;e by the bridle, and a number of others came round me; the pri&s;oner did not come him|&s;elf. Some of the people there (Jacob and John Huber) came and took Kuyder off, and be then &s;eized me by the foot, and endeavoured to di&s;|mount me, but he failed. He then again took hold of the bridle, but Habers relea&s;ed me again. Fries came up and &s;aid, "Foulke, you &s;hall be taken, if you will get off, there &s;hall no man hurt you." He took hold of the bridle, and ordered Kuyder to hold it; I rode up to the &s;table, got off, and went into the hou&s;e. When in the room, which was very thick of people, the pri&s;oner came and demanded my a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment papers. I told him that I did not like to give them up; he told me not to he&s;i|tate, but to do it. In that &s;ituation I gave them to him, and told him
<PB N="116" REF="037104_0120_100D852999CBD9F0">
I was in hopes he would not take them away without giving them to me again when he had looked at them.&mdash;I then went into another room with &s;ome of them, who exclaimed much again&s;t the law. Huber &s;aid they were not willing to &s;ubmit to it yet. Fries then gave me the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment papers again unhurt, and told me that he had u&s;ed me better than I de|&s;erved, and that if I had a mind I might return him to court, which I had before threatened. He then went with me to the bar, and took me to my hor&s;e through the mob, and held the bridle while I got on, and I rode off.</P>

<HEAD>MR. EWING, After the evidence on the part of the pri&s;oner was clo&s;ed, ro&s;e and ad|dre&s;&s;ed the jury as follows:</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please your honors: AND YOU, GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU are now gentlemen in the di&s;charge of the mo&s;t important duty, which po&s;&s;ibly has, or ever can fall to your lot as members of &s;ociety.&mdash;This is a cau&s;e of the greate&s;t magnitude, of the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion.&mdash;Its impor|tance is derived not only from a con&s;ideration that the life of the pri&s;oner is now at &s;take, but al&s;o from the precedent that your verdict will e&s;tabli&s;h in &s;imilar ca&s;es in future. From this view of it, it claims the highe&s;t and mo&s;t &s;erious attention that can be be&s;towed upon it.</P>
<P>When I addre&s;s you on this occa&s;ion, I feel diffident, le&s;t my ideas &s;hould not be cloathed with that per&s;picuity, or clearne&s;s, that I could wi&s;h; or my &s;entiments delivered with that ea&s;e or Elegance that might en&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s. I &s;hall rely upon your goodne&s;s to forgive any innacuracy of &s;tyle or &s;entiment that your penetration may di&s;cover in my addre&s;s to you.</P>
<P>When I addre&s;s you on this occa&s;ion it is with an anxiety of mind, which I never before experienced, when I reflect upon the po&s;&s;ible i&s;&s;ue of this cau&s;e with re&s;pect to the unfortunate pri&s;oner at the bar.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the public mind, now rou&s;ed to re&s;entment; the place where this &s;ubject is made matter of enquiry; together with the preju|dices that may exi&s;t again&s;t the defendant, all con&s;pire to form &s;trong ob|&s;tacles to the defence which I &s;hall attempt on this occa&s;ion. But when I con&s;ider your characters gentlemen, I am fully per&s;uaded, that you will &s;uffer no circum&s;tances of this kind to bias your impartial judgments, to de&s;troy that inflexible integrity which chracterizes you; or prevent this defendant from receiving from your hands (which is all he a&s;ks) a fair, a candid and impartial trial; that you will hear his cau&s;e under every pre|&s;umption of his innocence, until the contrary is proved by the mo&s;t uncon|trovertible evidence&mdash;That it is e&s;&s;ential to the very exi&s;tence of every government; that it is e&s;&s;ential to the pre&s;ervation of life, liberty and property, that offences &s;hould be puni&s;hed, and that the crime of trea&s;on, the highe&s;t that a member of &s;ociety can commit, is what I will admit, but I contend that it is equally e&s;&s;ential to the exi&s;tence of a government, and to our &s;ecurity as members of it, that every man indicted, &s;hould have a fair trial; to have the offence defined with certainty, and proved in &s;uch a manner, as to leave no po&s;&s;ibility of doubt on the minds of the jury.</P>
<P>That this man has been guilty of a flagrant violation of the law, an offence for which he de&s;erves to &s;uffer, and which the good of &s;ociety re|quires &s;hould be puni&s;hed, is what I readily admit; but I do contend, and I a&s;&s;ert with confidence, becau&s;e I think the law will bear me out, that no act the pri&s;oner has committed can be con&s;trued trea&s;on, by the mo&s;t rigid, or &s;trained con&s;truction of law.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="037104_0122_100D852D8A9C7610">
Gentlemen permit me to ob&s;erve, that in proportion to the nature and magnitude of an offence, &s;o ought the evidence to be.&mdash;As the accu&s;ation again&s;t this man is of the deepe&s;t dye, as it is the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible offence again&s;t the laws and government that he could commit; &s;o &s;hould the proof of it come from the pure&s;t &s;ources, and be of that nature as to e&s;ta|bli&s;h the crime beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of a doubt.</P>
<P>He is indicted for the crime of trea&s;on:&mdash;happy for us that we are not now left to the con&s;truction of judges;&mdash;to the opinions of men of any kind, or we might be led a&s;tray in a variety of in&s;tances, and at times in|troduce accumulative trea&s;on. The people of this country, knowing the magnitude of this object, and the propriety of good &s;ecurity again&s;t &s;uch con&s;tructions ingrafted into the con&s;titution, the definition of the crime, and tran&s;mitted to us unimpaired. Congre&s;s recognized the con&s;titutional definition, by ingrafting al&s;o the very words of the con&s;titution into the act for the puni&s;hment of crimes: they have there pre&s;cribed the puni&s;h|ment; they have &s;aid that the perpetrators of this crime &s;hall &s;uffer death. We are now to con&s;ider how far the defendant is guilty of trea&s;on, as laid in the indictment. I had meant to have gone more largely and fully into this &s;ubject from the authorities of law writers of eminence; but my learned colleague has &s;o ably, in &s;o ma&s;terly a manner handled this cau&s;e, that le&s;s remains for me to do. I &s;hall endeavour to &s;how you what is to be under&s;tood by levying war again&s;t the government of the United States, and think I can re&s;t on that ground with &s;afety, to prove to your &s;atisfaction, that the pri&s;oner has not been guilty of the crime of trea&s;on.</P>
<P>The defence re&s;ts upon three grounds.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. That he has not been guilty of the crime charged in the indictment.</P>
<P>Secondly. If he has been guilty of any crime at all, the act of Congre&s;s has &s;ufficiently defined it, and pre&s;cribed the puni&s;hment not to be capital.</P>
<P>Thirdly. I contend that the proclamation of the Pre&s;ident &s;hould operate as a pardon to take off the guilt of actions done previou&s;ly there|unto, if not continued in.</P>
<P>Judge Iredell here interrupted Mr. Ewing, re&s;pecting the pardon; and &s;aid that a plea mu&s;t be put in, if that was in&s;i&s;ted on, but the pri&s;oner mu&s;t plead guilty to plead pardon. The proclamation was read by Mr. Ewing, in which he ob&s;erved, there was no pardon promi&s;ed.</P>
<P>Mr. Dallas &s;aid he had begun &s;peaking on this point before, but was interrupted from explaining his idea: he thought there was much differ|ence between an a&s;&s;emblage before and after an admonition to di&s;per&s;e: it doubtle&s;s would have been trea&s;on had they continued in arms, but their future actions put a con&s;truction upon their pa&s;t actions, and proved that they were guilty of riot, and not trea&s;on.</P>
<P>Mr. Ewing continued.&mdash;This oppo&s;ition aro&s;e from ignorance; they did not know, that the law was in force; and the fir&s;t time they knew that, was by the proclamation, when they actually did di&s;per&s;e, and &s;ub|mit to the law.</P>
<P>The pri&s;oner at the bar is not guilty of the trea&s;on laid in the indict|ment, for Fir&s;t, there mu&s;t be a traitorous intention, and Secondly, that in|tention mu&s;t be carried into effect. In order to prove that, we mu&s;t trace his conduct through Bucks county, and then proceed to Bethlehem, where the act of trea&s;on is &s;aid to have been committed. In order to di&s;cover what is meant by levying war, we are obliged to re&s;ort to the authority,
<PB N="119" REF="037104_0123_100D852F1672B058">
or deci&s;ion of Engli&s;h courts on the &s;tatute of Edward the III. but though every thing that has been done there, is not to be con&s;idered as a pro|per precedent for us here, yet there are &s;ome rules and con&s;tructions in England that will apply to particular ca&s;es here.&mdash;Wherever a &s;et of men take up arms to oppo&s;e them&s;elves, to the government generally: to &s;ub|vert the laws, or to reform them; in that ca&s;e they are &s;aid to levy war again&s;t the government. The great criterion to di&s;tingui&s;h what amounts to this crime is the <HI>quo animo,</HI> or the intention with which the act was done. The object mu&s;t be of a general nature, and not an a&s;&s;embly to do a particular act, this would not be trea&s;on. I &s;hall now &s;how by the con|duct of the pri&s;oner that his views were not of a general nature, and that it was by no means marked with that degree of malignity which the coun|cil for the pro&s;ecution have repre&s;ented. You will con&s;ider that the re&s;i|dence of the pri&s;oner was remote from the &s;eat of government; and from that &s;ource of correct information, which as a member of &s;ociety he ought to have received, whereby to regulate his conduct. The people with whom he conver&s;ed were unacquainted with your language, warmly, and perhaps &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly attached to old e&s;tabli&s;hed laws and cu&s;toms of the place where they re&s;ided. Having been accu&s;tomed to be taxed and a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by men of their own choice; men who&s;e conduct they had a right to &s;crutinize, and whom they had u&s;ed to bring to account: You need not be &s;urprized that the&s;e people would at lea&s;t he&s;itate at admitting in|novations into their cu&s;toms: the ideas which &s;truck them naturally were, "From what &s;ource can this law ari&s;e, that &s;hould &s;end a &s;tranger into our town&s;hips to make a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments; a right which exclu&s;ively, as we think, belongs to us?" They did not feel &s;uch prejudice again&s;t this law, con&s;ider|ed as to its effects but from the manner of its breaking upon their view: The introduction of this new principle alarmed them, but they a&s;&s;embled not to oppo&s;e the law, but to gain time for information of the real exi&s;tence of it. Under this delu&s;ion they laboured, becau&s;e they had not the advan|tage we have, of enjoying information, and the illiterate &s;tate they were in operated as a great &s;ource of their oppo&s;ition. This ignorance and de|lu&s;ion was peculiarly manife&s;ted throughout all their conduct. Their fir&s;t meeting was held to con&s;ider whether it was a law or not; not being &s;a|tisfied about it, and di&s;appointed in their information, they met again, in order to tell the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors not to come about their town&s;hip to make the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments, until their doubts were removed: the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors went on how|ever, and all this while the people were enveloped in darkne&s;s. They warn the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors; they tell them "we don't want to repeal this law by violence"&mdash;No, if they had, arre&s;ting the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors would not have done it, they mu&s;t have gone to an higher &s;ource; and if they had gone there with a determination to repeal or oppo&s;e it, the act might have received the &s;tamp of trea&s;on. I deny that they arre&s;ted any of the officers of the go|vernment in the execution of their duty: we have repeatedly a&s;ked upon what authority the&s;e men acted; we have a&s;ked, and have not obtained &s;atisfaction, and we therefore pre&s;ume the authority does not exi&s;t; and where there is no law, there is no tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. But &s;uppo&s;e they had produced their authority, to what would their oppo&s;ition have amounted? To a riot, and no farther. What cour&s;e did Fries take in this &s;cene? Humanity and tenderne&s;s, wherever his interpo&s;ition was nece&s;&s;ary, and be was pre&s;ent, characterized him. So far from &s;ubverting the govern|ment:
<PB N="120" REF="037104_0124_100D853342806568">
&s;o far from preventing the execution of its laws; &s;o far from in|juring, or puni&s;hing the&s;e a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors while entirely in his power: he pre|vented the very people who were with him from doing tho&s;e acts, and he him&s;elf was indu&s;trious to relea&s;e them, and lead them into a place of &s;afe|ty. If conduct like this is to be con&s;trued into the crime of trea&s;on; what act, I a&s;k, will not by and by: if this is trea&s;on, it is unhappy for us, for thou&s;ands in the United States have been guilty of the &s;ame thing. Becau&s;e a law exi&s;ts, mu&s;t we acquie&s;ce implicitly&mdash;have we not a right as freemen, to think&mdash;have we not a right to object to it? It is impo&s;&s;ible that we &s;hould be all of one mind, with re&s;pect to the beneficial con&s;equences of a law&mdash;&s;ome difference of opinion will nece&s;&s;arily exi&s;t. The oppo&s;ition was manife&s;ted in different places, but it was all to the &s;ame law; but the oppo&s;ition did, in no in&s;tance amount to a traitorous intention, nor was it ever manife&s;ted in their conduct from the beginning to the end. I a&s;k you, if Fries ever took any active part in it, &s;o as to di&s;tingui&s;h him as their leader? It has been declared that he oppo&s;ed the law, and likewi&s;e that he took men to Bethlehem to re&s;cue the pri&s;oners, but we do not find there was any command given. There was a differ|ence of opinion on their way, whether they &s;hould go to Bethlehem or not: If he had commanded the&s;e men, and had intended to levy war again&s;t the government, &s;ome of them would not have returned; but he would have led them on to the object without con&s;ultation. Trace him towards Bethlehem: there were &s;everal who could not pa&s;s the bridge, becau&s;e toll was demanded: when he came up he &s;aid "count my men." No doubt he meant only the men of his own company, becau&s;e we do not hear that he paid for more than his own. It does not appear that he had any commu|nication whatever, informing him that &s;uch a party were to meet there that day, much le&s;s can it be imagined there were any trea&s;onable com|munication. He went up with his men, but we find while another com|pany formed before the hou&s;e, his men &s;tood aloof; they did not form there in the ranks, nor did they come there for that purpo&s;e. The con&s;i|deration that &s;ome of their country people were taken pri&s;oners, and they thought it was uncon&s;titutional and oppre&s;&s;ive for them to be taken to Phi|ladelphia to be impri&s;oned and tried, induced them to in&s;i&s;t upon the re&s;|cue. What did they &s;ay?&mdash;"We will bail them: if they are guilty, they ought to &s;uffer." Bail is refu&s;ed: the mar&s;hal could not have granted that reque&s;t, but they did not know that. When they found this their propo&s;al was rejected, they determine they will have the men. Then John Fries appeared&mdash;a man who had u&s;ed the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors re&s;pectfully: a man who&s;e character was that of humanity&mdash;he was cho&s;en to go in to the mar&s;hal to demand the pri&s;oners. One &s;aid he &s;hould be commander of them; but it does not appear that he did take the command at all; but we hear of two others who commanded on that day. Fries went in and con|ver&s;ed on the relea&s;e of the pri&s;oners with the mar&s;hal, who with great firmne&s;s &s;aid, that they mu&s;t be taken from him. He went out again, and the men being pretty warm, he checked them: went a &s;econd and third time: all his aim was to prevent the &s;hedding of blood; he pledged him&s;elf to the mar&s;hal that no harm &s;hould come to him from him or <HI>his</HI> company.</P>
<P>If the object of the&s;e people had been of a general nature, men &s;o ob|noxious in the county as Balliott, Henry and Eyerly would not have e&s;|caped

their vengeance, or re&s;entment, when they were &s;o much within their power: had their conduct been &s;tamped with trea&s;on, they would not have been &s;atisfied with re&s;cuing the pri&s;oners: the officers would have &s;uffered, but not one we find was hurt. One &s;trong trait, worthy your ob&s;ervation is, that their view in going to Bethlehem was not to prevent the operati|on of the law, but &s;imply to re&s;cue the pri&s;oners; and in this, their con|duct cannot amount to more than a riot and re&s;cue: an offence defined as well as its puni&s;hment, in an act of Congre&s;s. As the overt act mu&s;t be laid in the county where the offence was committed, and if it is true that trea&s;on was not committed at Bethlehem, where &s;hall we look for it? the gentlemen will not attempt to prove, I pre&s;ume, that the beginning of the trea&s;onable act was in Bucks county, and its completion at Beth|lehem. But Bucks has nothing to do with the pre&s;ent indictment at all, and ought not be brought into view.</P>
<P>Mr. Ewing then referred to Fo&s;ter 210, and 1 Hale 143 and Lord George Gordon's ca&s;e, each of which, he &s;aid, far exceeded the ca&s;e of the pri&s;oner at the bar. But, he ob&s;erved, as the time and patience of the jury, to which he felt him&s;elf &s;o much indebted, and which had been &s;o &s;everely tried already in this lengthy trial; and as the defence had been &s;o ably handled by Mr. Dallas, and what remained would be, he had no doubt, well conducted by the ju&s;tly acknowledged great talents of another learned advocate, he &s;hould forbear enlarging. The verdict you give, gentlemen, &s;aid he, will not only be of va&s;t moment to the pri&s;oner, but will al&s;o e&s;tabli&s;h a precedent for future &s;imilar ca&s;es, and it will be to your immortal honour if you pre&s;erve and decide with impartiality and firmne&s;s; while on the contrary, it will be a &s;ource of &s;hame and di&s;grace if you do otherwi&s;e, through the influence of prejudice or the operation of external circum&s;tances. I can &s;afely tru&s;t the life of my client in your hands, under a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that tho&s;e feelings of humanity, and a ju&s;t e&s;timation of the evidence, will outweigh all other con&s;iderations, and thus will your righteous verdict gain you the gratitude of you country, the ap|probation of your own con&s;ciences, and the warme&s;t thanks of the defend|ant.</P>

<HEAD>MR. SITGREAVES.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>With submission to your Honours. GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I ACKNOWLEDGE the propriety of an ob&s;ervation which dropped from one of the council for the pri&s;oner in the cour&s;e of his addre&s;s to you: that is, that tho&s;e who are concerned for the pro&s;ecution in criminal ca&s;es &s;hould not endeavour, by their eloquence or ingenuity to divert the attention of the jury from the truth, or to &s;tretch that truth &s;o as to give them more unfavourable impre&s;&s;ions on the facts than they will bear. This I mu&s;t acknowledge would have been unnece&s;&s;ary advice to me, be|cau&s;e the views I &s;hall be able to take of this &s;ubject will be but feeble and imperfect. In the cour&s;e of my limited and &s;hort experience, I have
<PB N="122" REF="037104_0126_100D853747EF18F0">
been but little conver&s;ant with criminal courts, and have paid but little attention to the criminal code, and never have been engaged in a ca&s;e &s;o important as the pre&s;ent, my public duties having, for &s;ome years pa&s;t drawn me from the bar. It may not be wondered, then, if I have not been able to bring into this court talents equal to meet tho&s;e called to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the pri&s;oner. I mu&s;t therefore &s;ay I &s;hall not be able to do ju&s;tice to the ca&s;e. I confe&s;s I feel a de&s;ire that tho&s;e per&s;ons who have been guilty of this &s;econd outrage and di&s;grace brought on the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, may feel the puni&s;hment the law inflicts. I hope you and every one who hears me will join in this &s;entiment, for on it hangs much of our peace and &s;ecurity. I have no objection to going &s;till farther&mdash;my lot is ca&s;t in that part of Penn&s;ylvania where this unfortunate circum|&s;tance occurred: I feel particularly for the good order, peace, and pro&s;|perity of that part of the &s;tate, but I have unhappily &s;een it in &s;uch a &s;ituation that all the harmony of &s;ociety was de&s;troyed, and if I were not to feel a &s;trong de&s;ire that peace, harmony, and good order &s;hould be re|&s;tored, I &s;hould be de&s;titute of humanity; for we all know that crimes can only be prevented by inflicting &s;uitable puni&s;hments on the delinquents. I wi&s;h, gentlemen, that the law &s;hould be executed again&s;t tho&s;e who were criminal, but when I &s;ay &s;o, let me not &s;ay that I wi&s;h the pri&s;oner at the bar to be executed: No, my earne&s;t wi&s;h is, that the general good of &s;ociety may be procured: this man mu&s;t be tried by the evidence that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> brought again&s;t him, and upon that alone he mu&s;t &s;tand for his guilt or innocence.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid thus much, I begin now to premi&s;e one or two things which I think &s;hould be altogether &s;et a&s;ide, but which has been much in&s;i&s;ted upon. You have been told that the pri&s;oner appears here on the charge of trea&s;on, under all the di&s;advantages of denunciation by the Pre|&s;ident of the United States in his proclamation. Any of the a&s;&s;ertions of that proclamation are not to have weight on your minds, nor will it ope|rate again&s;t the pri&s;oner: he is to be tried by the evidence only, and you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> not to regard any thing you have heard out of doors before this trial commenced: nothing &s;hould operate to doom the pri&s;oner to an harder <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">te than the law, &s;upported by fair te&s;timony provides. It is al&s;o as true that nothing contained in that proclamation &s;hould operate to the benefit of the pri&s;oner: if it &s;hould not convict him, no more &s;hould it acquit him. The analogy which has been drawn does not exi&s;t between this proclamation and the riot act of England, as you have been told, but even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> did, the inference would not be ju&s;t. You were told that all who di&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e on the reading of that act, are pardoned for crimes previou&s;ly com|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ted: it is not &s;o. But more of that pre&s;ently. The proclamation of the Pre&s;ident was i&s;&s;ued for one purpo&s;e, and the riot act, in England, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ad for another. The Pre&s;ident has no authority to call forth a military power but under certain circum&s;tances: wherever a combination &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> which are too &s;trong for the civil power to quell, then the military <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> be called in to aid the civil, but with a humanity intending to pre|&s;ent the effu&s;ion of human blood, and to call out military force as &s;eldom as po&s;&s;ible, the law has provided that a proclamation &s;hall be previou&s;ly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, that the offenders may di&s;per&s;e peaceably to their homes: but there is not a a &s;yllable about pardon in it. The Pre&s;ident has the power to par|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, it is true, but he has not done it by that proclamation.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="037104_0127_100D853A745E0D38">
The riot act, which pa&s;&s;ed in the reign of George I. was enacted in order to prevent tumultuous a&s;&s;emblies: if people refu&s;ed to depart wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|in one hour after it was read, they were guilty of felony, for which they were to &s;uffer death, although the offence before was only a mi&s;demean|our, yet the refu&s;al to depart makes it felony, but it cannot be pretended that any &s;uch departure excu&s;ed them from the riot, but on the contrary, pro&s;ecution and conviction frequently takes place for that crime, although they &s;hould di&s;per&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and therefore it does not affect the merits of the ca&s;e. The proclamation is as a blank paper before us, and therefore we mu&s;t examine this ca&s;e upon its own independant merits.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, in &s;umming up this ca&s;e on the part of the United States, the method mo&s;t natural to adopt is,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. To con&s;ider the law as relating to this &s;ubject.</P>

<P>Fir&s;t, with re&s;pect to the law on trea&s;on. I &s;hould have expected it was well under&s;tood that there would have been no difference among&s;t us, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ever we might differ on its application to the pri&s;oner, yet unfortunate there is, and we mu&s;t endeavour to meet tho&s;e objections. The &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ment which was made to you at the opening by my&s;elf, and a &s;tatement by the attorney of the di&s;trict, I believe to be correct: I am confir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in that opinion, and have no doubt it will be given to you by the co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the charge as correct. We are not at this day to di&s;tract our&s;elves with theory: The law of Edward 3 of England, called by &s;ome "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;acred &s;tatute," and by others the parliament who enacted it, is call<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> "The Ble&s;&s;ed parliament," that law and our con&s;titution have adopted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ame words. The judges in England, as eminent for their patrioti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> eminent for their tenderne&s;s, and as eminent for their ability as any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> were in this country, have &s;olemnly &s;ettled this particular in a va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> of in&s;tances and unfortunately, young as this country is, there has been the nece&s;&s;ity for a court of the United States for this di&s;trict to &s;ettle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> principle likewi&s;e. The adjudications under this &s;tatute were made by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> all well known for their love of liberty. We have no need to conjure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a different expo&s;ition, or different form of con&s;truction, than what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> already been admitted in both countries: indeed it is what cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;haken at this day. It is, <HI>that all insurrections by a multitude of people with intention to usurp by violence or intimidation the lawful authority, of the government in matters of a general and public concern, in which the insurgents have no interests distinct from the rest of the community <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> TREASON.</HI> From the be&s;t con&s;ideration I have been able to give the &s;ubject, I have formed this definition, which I believe compri&s;es <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> whole that can be &s;aid about it, and I believe no more: I think this a&s;&s;ertion will appear to be ju&s;tified by the be&s;t authorities. If this de&s;cription is ju&s;t, the offence is clearly &s;ettled and amounts to "levying war again&s;t the United States." In the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential parts, I think the rule has been &s;ettled by the council for the pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>The <HI>Intention,</HI> which con&s;titutes the gi&s;t of the offence, is proved to have been to &s;ome general object; if the intention was to gratify <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="124" REF="037104_0128_100D853C3861D680">
private concern or intere&s;t, even if there be all the apparatus of war, as guns, fifes, drums, &amp;c. whatever violence &s;hould be committed under it, it cannot amount to trea&s;on, becau&s;e the intention is not to a public matter, whatever other crime it may amount to, and whatever enor|mities may be committed. This may be the ca&s;e, in order to gratify &s;ome particular pa&s;&s;ion, or &s;ome particular intere&s;t. It is the intention, which di&s;tingui&s;hes trea&s;on from other crimes: Riot, is generally much like it, but not being of a public nature, is only a mi&s;demeanour: Trea&s;on on the contrary, is the greate&s;t crime known to the laws of any country. Lord Mansfield at the trial of lord George Gordon, expre&s;&s;es the &s;ame opinion. If this is a true po&s;ition, it is certainly an irre&s;i&s;table inference, that in&s;urrection for the purpo&s;e of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing and preventing the execu|tion of a public law, is to prevent or obtain a public object, and of cour&s;e mu&s;t be high trea&s;on within the rule of our con&s;titution. Yes, this has been repeatedly denied, by the gentleman, to be high trea&s;on; nay, he even went on &s;o far as to &s;ay that in England, no &s;uch thing had taken place; he &s;ays it mu&s;t be a combination to oppo&s;e alt the laws; or at lea&s;t, to force the repeal of a law. Gentlemen, I think I have &s;tated enough, to convince you that this is erroneous: If trea&s;on is the unlawful pur&s;uit of an object of a public nature, then the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing of a public law is trea&s;on. But I would not have you re&s;t on my definition if I can|not bring you full proof in favour of it. See 1 Hawkins Chap. 17, Sect. 25. 1 Hale, 133. And this po&s;ition is confirmed &s;till further, by a pre|cedent of our own. 2 Dallas, 346, &amp;c. I con&s;ider this &s;ettles the que&s;tion beyond all doubt, and it ought to re&s;t &s;o forever, the deci&s;ion was &s;o &s;eri|ous and &s;olemn in both countries. I &s;hall a&s;&s;ume this as an acknowledged point throughout the whole of my enquiry. I &s;hould have added the opinion of Mr. Er&s;kine in lord George Gordon's trial. Speaking on the trea&s;on &s;tatute, he &s;ays, None of them have &s;aid more than this, that war may be levied, not only by de&s;troying the con&s;titution, or the government it&s;elf, but by a&s;&s;uming the appearance of war, to endeavour to &s;uppre&s;s a law which it has enacted.</P>
<P>It is certain that Briti&s;h ca&s;es go much farther, and if it was nece&s;&s;ary and the ca&s;e required it, it could be ju&s;tified by deci&s;ions in England upon points infinitely le&s;s &s;trong, than tho&s;e I have quoted: points which were &s;ettled at a very early period, which neither the parliaments nor the courts have ever interpo&s;ed to change. Ca&s;es of public grievances, whether real or pretended, whether they grow out of law, or out of practice, as pull|ing down all enclo&s;ures, &amp;c. which are the inva&s;ions of private right, from its univer&s;ality&mdash;is high trea&s;on. Again, u&s;urping the powers of the go|vernment by pulling down all bawdy hou&s;es, is High trea&s;on. The ca&s;e referred to by Mr. Bradford in Mifflin county was, that a particular judge was driven from the bench: they did not oppo&s;e the &s;itting of the court, but they had a re&s;entment again&s;t the individual, and therefore the pro&s;ecution was for riot. This will a&s;&s;i&s;t us in our farther enquiries upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. This crime is &s;aid not to be trea&s;on but a re&s;cue and bare ob|&s;truction of proce&s;s, and within the &s;edition law, or within a clau&s;e of the penal code, and therefore not trea&s;on. But whatever nature an offence may be, of it&s;elf, if it is accompanied with this particular act of trea&s;on, the act becomes trea&s;on: I willingly admit that a re&s;cue of pri&s;oners may be without trea&s;on: a per&s;on may be willing to ri&s;k the law rather than
<PB N="125" REF="037104_0129_100D853EA0557740">
his friend &s;hould &s;uffer, and may therefore re&s;cue him; this would be but mi&s;demanour: If ten men in arms go to an officer and re&s;cue his pri|&s;oner, if it be done in a private manner, it is no more than a mi&s;demean|our; but if the&s;e &s;ame ten men in arms go from motives of a public nature, then it becomes trea&s;on. The intention therefore, makes the crime to differ.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid farther that the legi&s;lature of the United States have pa&s;&s;ed a &s;olemn opinion upon it, and that they have called it no more than a combination of certain facts; a re&s;cue, &amp;c. again&s;t which it has provided, and therefore it cannot now be called trea&s;on.&mdash;I think this received a good an&s;wer by judge Wil&s;on, 2 Dallas 351, and the objection was &s;o|lemnly over-ruled by the court. The &s;edition act was not made at that time to be &s;ure, but if it had, there can be no doubt but it would receive the &s;ame an&s;wer, and meet the &s;ame fate by this judge if read in objec|tion. But the fir&s;t &s;ection of the &s;edition act de&s;cribes a different &s;ort of combination, and is not levying of war. There mu&s;t be of nece&s;&s;ity a con&s;piracy in levying war, but there may not be in an unlawful combina|tion.</P>
<P>JUDGE PETERS.&mdash;Whatever the crime would have been without a trea&s;onable intention, with a trea&s;onable intention would con&s;titute the overt act.</P>
<P>MR. SITGREAVES.&mdash;The ca&s;es in the books are &s;trongly demon&s;trative of this particular. 212 Fo&s;ter. Ben&s;tead's ca&s;e. "Certain unpopular mea|&s;ures having pa&s;&s;ed in the council, the odium was thrown on the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury. A paper was pa&s;ted up in London, exhorting the appren|tices to ri&s;e and &s;ack the archbi&s;hop's hou&s;e at Lambeth, and accordingly &s;ome thou&s;ands went with a declaration that they would tear the arch|bi&s;hop in pieces."</P>
<P>It was not attacking the individual, but the officer that became high trea&s;on. The &s;ame with re&s;pect to the attack on general Neville's hou&s;e during the we&s;tern in&s;urrection; the attack on him was, becau&s;e he was an officer, and therefore being upon the office and not the man, it was upon the government, and high trea&s;on.</P>
<P>Such is the general opinion of trea&s;on; the great enquiry will now be what was the intention with which the offence at Bethlehem was perpe|trated? It is allowed to be a re&s;cue; it is conceded al&s;o that there was an ob&s;truction of proce&s;s: If it was &s;o it was part of the general &s;y&s;tem which being of this public nature, obtains the magnitude and operation of trea&s;on. Before I go into the examination of this, I will make an ob&s;er|vation on what has been &s;aid: that the overt act mu&s;t be proved in the county where it is laid. I heard this po&s;ition, but I did not di&s;cover my application of it, and therefore I am at a lo&s;s to know how to treat it. There exi&s;ts in England, and in the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, a form in the direction to the grand jury, which de&s;erves notice; they are &s;worn to en|quire for <HI>the body of the county.</HI> This cau&s;es con&s;iderable difficulty par|ticularly where &s;omething done out of the county is required as an in|gredient in the charge, and if the beginning of a crime was in one county, and its completion in another, the difficulty would be greater; but even tho&s;e difficulties are remedied. The idea of his honour judge Peters the other day, appears to be &s;ound. That a di&s;trict is the &s;ame as it re&s;pects the United States, as a county is to a &s;tate, and therefore, the grand jury
<PB N="126" REF="037104_0130_100D854198CA2160">
are drawn, not from the body of the county, but from the body of the di&s;trict, and the whole extent of the di&s;trict is equally connected with the <HI>venue</HI> if it be laid there. As to the evidence, therefore, I con&s;ider the crime may be laid in one county, and proved in another. 2 Hawkins, chap. 46, Sect. 182. I con&s;ider whatever rule applies in England or in our &s;tate governments relative to counties, is the &s;ame re&s;pecting di&s;tricts under the general government of the United States; likewi&s;e, if the overt act be proved in the county where it is laid, you may go out of the coun|ty for evidence to &s;how the intention with which it was committed. This, I think, cannot be denied. In Fo&s;ter 9, we &s;ee that an overt act not laid, may be brought as evidence to &s;upport one that is laid, in order to &s;hew the intention.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to hear&s;ay evidence, the rule of law is, that the circum|&s;tance of the oral te&s;timony is regarded, as it may tend to e&s;tabli&s;h other evidence, though of it&s;elf it be no proof. There are a variety of in&s;tan|ces in which it is nece&s;&s;ary to be admitted, though there is a rule again&s;t it in others. In all ca&s;es where proof is to be made by evidence of gene|ral reputation it is u&s;eful: &s;o upon this occa&s;ion, it is competent to us to prove the general &s;tate of the country; if proper to &s;hew the general &s;tate of a country where in&s;urrection prevails, it is as proper in order to &s;hew the general combination, the de&s;ign and intention, becau&s;e it may be the only effectual way of coming at that knowledge. For in&s;tance: this in|formation which was received by the commi&s;&s;ioner in the di&s;charge of his official duty is proper evidence to &s;hew why the law was not carried into effect, and con&s;equently the criminal &s;pirit of the country. Popham's re|ports 152.</P>
<P>Mr. Sitgreaves then went into the ca&s;e of lord George Gordon, which had not been repre&s;ented to the jury by Mr. Dallas to his &s;atisfaction. He related the circum&s;tances of that riot at length. He &s;aid the acquittal of that gentleman was not a certain proof of his innocence: doubts might have ari&s;en on the minds of the jury as to the &s;ufficiency, or charac|ter of the evidence, or there may have been a contradiction of te&s;timony, by which all the credit of it would be taken away. Be&s;ides, it did not appear to him that the act of High trea&s;on was committed; the multitude who accompanied Lord George to the Parliament hou&s;e did not go to compel a repeal of the law, or to overawe the Parliament, but from a re|port that the numerous &s;ignatures were not rightly obtained, they went to &s;tamp truth on the in&s;trument, and convince Parliament of the re&s;pectabi|lity of the &s;igners. Be&s;ides the main point of evidence of what a per&s;on heard Lord Gordon &s;ay in the Lobby, was received doubtfully by the ju|ry. Many things went to make the te&s;timony not &s;o unambiguous as it ought to be on a trial for life or death, and on that account perhaps the learned judge charged them, if a doubt hung upon their minds, to acquit the pri&s;oner. Upon the whole no inference can be drawn from that ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, another extraordinary po&s;ition was taken by both the council in defence of the pri&s;oner. It was &s;aid that it could be no offence to re&s;cue pri&s;oners who were taken up for acts committed again&s;t men who acted without authority, nor to oppo&s;e men who had not authority to a&s;&s;e&s;s under this law. It was attempted to be &s;hown you that &s;ome of the a&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors had not received their warrants agreeable to the act of Congre&s;s,
<PB N="127" REF="037104_0131_100D8544049BBBB8">
and thence all the outrages were tolerated! I do not &s;uppo&s;e that the gentlemen engaged for the pri&s;oner means to go beyond the ca&s;e in which they are engaged, but I mu&s;t &s;ay that their zeal on this occa&s;ion has introduced a dangerous principle&mdash;if the apo&s;tle of any in&s;urrection had come reeking from the gore of Europe, and had preached up to you this doctrine, he could not have done it more compleatly than tho&s;e gen|tlemen; agreeable to this the whole country may rai&s;e them&s;elves into array again&s;t to the who <HI>de facto</HI> exerci&s;e the authority of the government and the laws, ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> if called to account the court mu&s;t be informed, if the ingenuity of the council can find a fault in the appointment of the per&s;ons engaged in the execution of the laws, that they have not tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the laws and upon that account! Is not this at once&s;apping the foundation of &s;o|ciety, and by a kind of encouragement of in&s;urrection, &s;triking hard at the root of all government? This is an oppo&s;ition in my opinion upon a dangerous and de&s;tructive ground. I am not di&s;po&s;ed at this time to en|ter into any argument whether it is nece&s;&s;ary to prove the appointment of the officers, but admitting it is true, that upon the indictment of per|&s;ons for ob&s;truction of proce&s;s or ob&s;truction of a public officer in his duty, is no offence without he prove his due appointment, yet it does not follow that facts given in evidence to prove an outrage, &s;hould require all that &s;trictne&s;s of examination. You will ob&s;erve that the pri&s;oner does not &s;tand charged with any thing but the re&s;cue at Bethlehem, he is not now charged with the offences he committed in Bucks, or any where el&s;e, much le&s;s with any thing where he was not pre&s;ent. The&s;e previous tran&s;actions are given you to &s;how the intention with which the la&s;t out|rage was committed: it is only to &s;hew the tendency of the de&s;ign. The&s;e gentlemen exerci&s;ed the offices, and it does not appear that there was the lea&s;t doubt expre&s;&s;ed in tho&s;e counties of their authority, neither by the pri&s;oner nor any per&s;on whatever who a&s;&s;ociated with him, at any time or on any occa&s;ion: their oppo&s;ition was not founded on any &s;uch pretext, but it grew merely out of the law, and therefore it mu&s;t appear that the outrage was an unequivocal fact, conducted with the intention, &s;o far as we can collect, to defeat the law. On the&s;e grounds there is no nece&s;&s;ity for proof of due appointment. But what are the objections, or what proof do they require. There is no preten&s;ions to a doubt re&s;pecting the legal appointment of any officer, but the two a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors at Penn in Northampton, and Milford in Bucks: Mr. Eyrely him&s;elf tells you that all the re&s;t were appointed by the board of Commi&s;&s;ioners, and that at Penn, the a&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or refu&s;ed, and Mr. Balliot had the blank to fill up. Re&s;pecting the other Mr. Foulke &s;upplied the place of Clark who held his appointment, and Mr. Foulke was appointed to a&s;&s;i&s;t him. How then, gentlemen, from tho&s;e two ca&s;es, could a general inference be warranted that <HI>the</HI> appoint|ments were irregular, and upon that ground the&s;e outrages be ju&s;tified?</P>
<P>We have heard much about the danger of following Engli&s;h prece|dents, and about the words <HI>high Treason.</HI> There is a &s;pecies of trea&s;on in England which cannot exi&s;t here; that is, con&s;piring again&s;t the life of the king, and &s;peaking of mere words which have frequently been con|&s;trued into that crime. It has been a que&s;tion of great doubt whether words can be called trea&s;on, but in that country or this, it is nece&s;&s;ary to prove the intention with which a crime was committed, and therefore mere words, though it is true cannot convict, yet if a man has done a
<PB N="128" REF="037104_0132_100D8546779026D0">
lawle&s;s act, we may exemplify the de&s;ign by words, even of the pri&s;oner him&s;elf. With re&s;pect to an action done publicly and notoriou&s;ly, that is a matter capable of po&s;itive and ab&s;olute evidence, plain to the &s;en&s;es; tho&s;e who &s;ee it can tell of it, but there can be no way of diving into the heart: if the party him&s;elf, from that rece&s;s, &s;hould develope his de&s;igns, the&s;e declarations made, either by him&s;elf or others who heard him, can prove the intention of his actions, and for that purpo&s;e is good evidence.</P>
<P>Gentlemen I have now &s;aid all which I think nece&s;&s;ary with re&s;pect to the law on trea&s;on. I am confident I have not done ju&s;tice to it; but what I have omitted will be amply &s;upplied by the attorney of the di&s;|trict, and their honours upon the bench.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to inve&s;tigate the facts as they have appeared in evidence, and apply the law to tho&s;e facts, in order to &s;how you what &s;hare of guilt the pri&s;oner tran&s;acted. In doing which I &s;hall only &s;elect the mo&s;t prominent features of the te&s;timony which may go to prove my po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t with re&s;pect to levying war. I think it will require but few words to &s;how that there has been an in&s;urrection in the three counties; that at Bethlehem there was a multitude of people in arms, amounting to the full &s;en&s;e of the words of "levying was with arms:" the in&s;urgents had all the apparatus and accoutrements of a regular military force, and they went there in military array. This is proved by fifteen witne&s;&s;es (not by two merely). It is farther certain that this multitude of people perpe|trated atrocious and lawle&s;s offences, and in contempt of all legal autho|rity, after &s;olemn, reiterated and repeated warning; that the mar&s;hal, conformable to that humanity which characterized him, &s;ent a deputati|on to them, requiring them to go home, and to abandon their purpo&s;e; that he &s;elected per&s;ons who were mo&s;t likely, from their political opinions to procure the object, but nothing would do for them &s;hort of what they &s;et out upon, and the mi&s;&s;ion failed.</P>
<P>We will next con&s;ider for what purpo&s;e this outrage was committed: It was &s;aid to be &s;imply for the purpo&s;e of relea&s;ing the pri&s;oners: this was the ab&s;tract and naked de&s;ign. If &s;uch is the fact, the pri&s;oner mu&s;t be acquitted, but if he had an object beyond that: if it &s;hould appear that this was one link in the chain of oppo&s;ition to the laws, then it a|mounts higher; it amounts to trea&s;on. It is my purpo&s;e to &s;how you that their de&s;igns were higher than a mere re&s;cue, and that it did not flow from any particular regard to the pri&s;oners in cu&s;tody, but it was a public oppo&s;ition, and one means u&s;ed with a view to prevent the execu|tion of a law of the United States. Gentlemen, the mere recital of one or two facts will be &s;ufficient to bring this home to the mind of any man who is not determined to &s;hut his eyes again&s;t plain te&s;timony.</P>
<P>It is in full and compleat proof before you, that in the counties of Northampton and Bucks, the oppo&s;ition was almo&s;t general, and that in the town&s;hip of Milford; all along the river Lehi, and both &s;ides of the mountain; there was an union in oppo&s;ition to the law, uniformly conduct|ed with &s;y&s;tem, menace, and threats; that the per&s;ons who thought pro|per to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the execution of that law, were previou&s;ly intimidated not to accept of it, and after they had accepted, they were prevented from executing it, and in many places, until the march of the army, the law did actually remain unexecuted. I &s;hall not &s;tate to you the particulars
<PB N="129" REF="037104_0133_100D854836D50C60">
of this evidence, but remark that the &s;y&s;tem was general, and that it was accompanied with threats and menace, and that the friends of the law, and tho&s;e who were peaceably inclined, were prevented, under the influence of this terror, from &s;peaking their minds on the occa&s;ion; and even the magi&s;trates of the country were &s;o impre&s;&s;ed, or &s;o intimidated, as not to perform the duties of their office: That the law was complete|ly pro&s;trate, and per&s;ons who would have given te&s;timony again&s;t them for the&s;e proceedings were afraid to do it. In the cour&s;e of this pro|ceeding, it was repeatedly declared, that if any per&s;on &s;hould be arre&s;ted for oppo&s;ition to the law, that they &s;hould be &s;upported. This &s;y&s;tem of menace was general; it was not an oppo&s;ition grounded particularly upon the obnoxious characters of per&s;ons who were employed in the ex|ecution of the law, but upon the law it&s;elf: There was an offer of a particular commi&s;&s;ioner to u&s;e his influence, that they might choo&s;e their own officer, but that would not &s;ati&s;fy their object&mdash;no, they &s;aid if they accepted that offer it would be approving the law, and that they would not do. Mr. Eyerly the commi&s;&s;ioner, had been for many years the repre&s;entative of this di&s;trict in the Legi&s;lature: Mr. Balliott had been in the Legi&s;lature, in the Council, and in the &s;tate convention, which proves they were men of confidence in their di&s;trict, and that the par|ticular di&s;like now exemplified was not to them as men, but as officers under the law. One of the council for the pri&s;oner went minutely into all their views, and the veins through which they acted, and endea|voured to palliate, or excu&s;e the conduct of the&s;e in&s;urgents; while, at the &s;ame time he appears to know what were the views of government in pro&s;ecuting the delinquents; but there is no nece&s;&s;ity to an&s;wer that, becau&s;e the pri&s;oner is not on his trial for ob&s;truction of proce&s;s. I mo&s;t &s;olemnly di&s;avow that political party &s;pirit enters at all into this pro&s;ecution, and beg the jury will di&s;mi&s;s all party &s;pirit and prejudice from their minds: However we may differ on points of law, we mu&s;t agree with them that the people had a right to examine and explain the law, and expre&s;s their di&s;like to this or any other law. Their oppo&s;ition to this law might have been right, or wrong; it does not alter the ca&s;e and God forbid that any motive of the kind &s;hould influence us to re|venge; The&s;e are natural rights under a free government, which every citizen has a right to exerci&s;e. We are not now enquiring into the nature, or grades of any, or all tho&s;e particular offences; whether this particular outrage is a riot, or that a mi&s;demeanour, or whether it a|mounts to trea&s;on, we are &s;imply &s;hewing to you, from the evidence collected, the weight and force of tho&s;e facts; to wit, that there was oppo&s;ition to this law, and that univer&s;ally, and that the&s;e people did their utmo&s;t, to endeavour to &s;top the execution of the law; and that the&s;e acts were in &s;trict union with the la&s;t act at Bethlehem, of the in|tention of which, the previous acts collectively are plain proof, for cer|tain it is, that an act illegal in its nature, may receive colour and com|plexion from one that is &s;trictly legal. Suppo&s;e a man had reduced his thoughts on this &s;ubject to writing, without any intention of communi|cating it to any per&s;on; &s;uppo&s;e in that writing his intentions are fully declared with which &s;uch writing was drawn; then this act, though in|nocent in it&s;elf, would be competent evidence to &s;hew the intention with
<PB N="130" REF="037104_0134_100D854B85E24D48">
which a &s;ub&s;equent outrage was perpetrated, and it would be in full proof to &s;how that a violent oppo&s;ition to the laws in that country par|ticularly to the and for the valuation of hou&s;es, and that it was not from a per&s;onal or private motive, but generally an aver&s;ion to the law it&s;elf, &s;o that a long time after the period fixed for its execution, the law actually remained unfulfilled. In &s;everal parts the people returned to a &s;en&s;e of their duty and &s;ubmitted to the laws, and happy would it have been for the government as well as them&s;elves if they had all done it; for then this inve&s;tigation would have been prevented: but in &s;ome parts, the mar&s;hal, and tho&s;e who were with him, who were not volun|teers as has been in&s;inuated, out acted in conformity to their duty as public officers.&mdash;The&s;e were in&s;ulted, arre&s;ted and ob&s;tructed as officers; The mar&s;hal was abu&s;ed by numbers of people at Millar's town, and he was not able, though he touched Shankweiler, to execute proce&s;s on him. Gentlemen, all I a&s;k of you, is to connect the circum&s;tances in your minds; the general cour&s;e of events which gave ri&s;e to what after|wards was con&s;ummated at Bethlehem. The pri&s;oners who were re&s;|cued were de&s;irous of accompanying the mar&s;hal to Philadelphia; they would rather not be liberated;&mdash;they were taken from various parts of the country, unknown to each other, and more &s;o to the per&s;ons who re&s;cued them: there was no private attachment, regard, or re&s;entment; What therefore could be the motive of the in&s;urgents? Could it be in|tere&s;t? No, it would be bad policy to &s;pend dollars to oppo&s;e a tax law rather than cents to &s;upport it. Was it a private di&s;tinct intere&s;t they had, which did not concern the community? If not, agreeable to Judge Fo&s;ter, it was trea&s;on. I have &s;aid that the&s;e pri&s;oners were not known to the in&s;urgents; I would make the exception of Shankweiler; but you will ob&s;erve that he never did &s;urrender him&s;elf to the cu&s;tody of the mar&s;hal, and though &s;ome &s;aid they were come to &s;ee him as a neighbour, others to &s;ee his partner, (accu&s;er) &amp;c. yet he was not <HI>de facto</HI> in cu&s;tody: It could not be to re&s;cue him that this large armed body met, becau&s;e he could have been &s;afe by keeping at home. But one &s;olemn fact re&s;pecting the others demands a &s;olemn inference: The Lehi pri&s;oners had cordially &s;ubmitted to the law, and thus de&s;ired to recommend them&s;elves to the mercy of the government by penitence, and actually at la&s;t gave the mar&s;hal their individual a&s;&s;urances to meet him at Philadelphia: I a&s;k then by way of inference what becomes of all the private object, or the neighbourhood e&s;teem nece&s;&s;ary to vindi|cate the&s;e in&s;urgents? It was not for the pri&s;oners' &s;akes, but through oppo&s;ition to the law that they did this act, for it is plain that the per|&s;ons in cu&s;tody of the mar&s;hal were afraid as much to tru&s;t them&s;elves in the hands of the mob, as Mr. Eyerly or Mr. Balliott were. They doubtle&s;s had a trea&s;onable, a rebellious determination to oppo&s;e the go|vernment; the previous declaration of the party was, that "if any per&s;ons were there in confinement who were oppo&s;ed to the law they &s;hould be re&s;cued," was a plain indication of their oppo&s;ition to the law, and that this re&s;cue was a part of the general oppo&s;ition. Mr. Sitgreaves then went into a review of the evidence re&s;pecting the meetings at Upper Milford, and at Schymer's, where, he &s;aid, oppo&s;ition to the law marked the conduct of the people, but at Lower Milford, the pri&s;oner at the
<PB N="131" REF="037104_0135_100D854EA744B048">
bar by his own confe&s;&s;ion, eminently di&s;played his intention; three wit|ne&s;&s;es corroborated the fact; "This was the third day he had been out on this bu&s;ine&s;s; he had a &s;kirmi&s;h ye&s;terday, and would have another to day (7th of March) if the pri&s;oners had not been given up." This clearly proves that the bu&s;ine&s;s at Milford was clo&s;ely connected with that at Bethlehem; thus being all parts of one whole, the former acts are full and compleat evidence of the latter. In Lower Milford they re&s;olve that the law &s;hould not be executed yet, becau&s;e they did not know it was a law: In reply to this we may &s;ay, it is inconceivable to &s;uppo&s;e that any people &s;hould be &s;o &s;tupid as to doubt the exi&s;|tence of a law, when the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors were actually going about the country in conformity to it; this is incredible notwith&s;tanding the charity we are forced to have for the&s;e people's ignorance. They farther re&s;olved, that their town&s;hip &s;hould be the la&s;t to &s;ubmit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The council reminded Mr. Sitgreaves that this was sworn to by but one witness.</HI></NOTE> to it, if it was a law. Is not this as much as to &s;ay, If others a&s;&s;i&s;t us in rebellion we will go on, but if all &s;ubmit, then we will al&s;o. No thanks to them. The a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors found it &s;o, for they were cha&s;ed, in&s;ulted, and finally obliged, to abandon the town&s;hip, and yet, in that town&s;hip the utmo&s;t po&s;&s;ible means were u&s;ed to convince them of their errors. At Mitchel's it was propo&s;ed to read the law, but in vain; they "did not want any damned laws." An offer was made to them to choo&s;e their own a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, which was likewi&s;e treated with di&s;dain: They &s;et the mo&s;t &s;olemn warning of con&s;equences at defiance, and defied even the government it&s;elf; &s;ome|times vainly fluttering them&s;elves, that they had all the people coming to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, they &s;et at nought the judicial authority, becau&s;e; they &s;uppo&s;ed they had arms and numbers &s;ufficient to &s;upport their oppo&s;ition. At Quakers town they re&s;olved to go to the re&s;cue, and there we find them all declaring oppo&s;ition to the law, and defiance to the government: They were engaged in the&s;e acts when they received? information from Northampton county that the pri&s;oners were in cu&s;tody, and then they &s;igned a re&s;olve to go to re&s;cue them.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, when the&s;e facts are taken into view, &s;o immediately preceding, and &s;o directly pointing to what took place at Bethlehem, can you he&s;itate, as hone&s;t men de&s;iring to do ju&s;tice, and &s;peak impartially between the pri&s;oner at the bar and his country, that he went there, not merely to re&s;cue pri&s;oners, but to execute a part of the general op|po&s;ition to that law of the United States? If he has done &s;o, he is guilty of Trea&s;on. Let us now attend to the evidence which grows out of the avowal of the parties them&s;elves at Bethlehem at the time of the outrage. The&s;e are previous indications, which certainly point as tru|ly to the intention, as the needle points to the pole.</P>
<P>Two per&s;ons appeared in arms ju&s;t at the arrival of the po&s;&s;e: the Mar&s;hal thought proper to take and di&s;arm them: upon being que&s;|tioned, they an&s;wered they came there in order to &s;ee what was be&s;t to be done for the country. They did not come to a&s;&s;i&s;t Shankweiler; they did not profe&s;s to have any friend&s;hip for the pri&s;oners, but to &s;ee whether the intere&s;t of the country was to be promoted by trea&s;on and rebellion. Can there be a &s;tronger proof than this that the object was of
<PB N="132" REF="037104_0136_100D855047E623F8">
a public, and not of a private nature. Keifer &s;aid he heard "it was to be made out about them laws." This is po&s;itive proof that it was to be &s;ettled that day, whether the laws or the people were to be triumphant; if they could overawe the mar&s;hal, probably they thought they were to be trium|phant. It is true this was not the declaration of the pri&s;oner at the bar, but of another per&s;on: upon this you will ob&s;erve, that where a great num|ber embark with one general object and de&s;ign, the acts and declarations of each are chargeable to all, and are proof again&s;t each and all. 6 Term. ca&s;e of the king again&s;t Stone. Though a man does not act or &s;ay one word, yet abetting the object, it leaves him equally re&s;pon&s;ible for the whole with tho&s;e who actually &s;peak or do. That this de&s;ign was of a public na|ture I farther prove, becau&s;e it was not this, that, or the other pri&s;oner they demanded but "the pri&s;oners," without knowing who were in the cu&s;tody of the mar&s;hal: they would not go from the ground until they had the whole of them. After the mar&s;hal had liberated them, &s;uppo&s;|ing one was left, the demand was made for him, and the mar&s;hal was forced to give them proof that he was gone. Indeed the conference of Mr. Fries with the mar&s;hal is &s;ufficient to &s;how the object, and &s;urely the application of his own conduct to his own ca&s;e will not be di&s;puted. Jamie&s;on tells you that Fries' own &s;tory was corre&s;pondent with that de|livered by the mar&s;hal: referring to the mar&s;hal's te&s;timony it appears that Fries, in conver&s;ation with him, when he delivered up the pri&s;oners, expre&s;sly avowed that it was not out of any friend&s;hip or attachment, but that his motive, was oppo&s;ition to the laws; that the laws were un|con&s;titutional, and that he would not &s;ubmit to them, and for this rea&s;on he had come to take the pri&s;oners, and he would per&s;evere until he had them. The mar&s;hal told him "you will be hanged." He treated that with contempt, and told him it was not in the power of the Govern|ment, for if they were to &s;end a military force, they would join in oppo|&s;ition to the law with them, Now this is a declaration of Mr. Fries, their leader; their &s;poke&s;man; their repre&s;entative, and &s;hall we not give credit to it? From this declaration, and the concurrent te&s;timony, I think there cannot be di&s;covered a crevis at which a doubt is to enter. Mr. Fries, when he came into the entry, talking loud, and with an im|portance becoming his dignity, gave his general opinion upon politics, &s;aying that tho&s;e who were now at the head of affairs, were all tories during the war, and in this way found fault with the laws. I do not find fault with the word "tories." I believe it bears analogy with the ridiculous word "Stamplers," and only can tend to &s;how the general di&s;approbation expre&s;&s;ed again&s;t the government, but when a variety of things concur, of whatever little importance they may be in them&s;elves, they are increa&s;ed by their accumulative weight, and thus become wor|thy of notice.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, it is farther given in evidence that, during the time they were at Bethlehem, there were repeated threats of violence thrown out again&s;t Mr. Eyerly, Mr. Balliott and Mr. Henry, on which account the the mar&s;hal de&s;ired them not to &s;hew them&s;elves to the people: the&s;e gentlemen who had been the confidential and favorite friends and &s;er|vants of the people are now in a dangerous &s;ituation, the objects of re|&s;entment, which re&s;entment, we have good rea&s;on to conclude was oc|ca&s;ioned by their offices under the government.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="037104_0137_100D8553080C8048">
Mr. Sitgreaves then an&s;wered &s;ome of the remarks of Mr. Dallas on the conduct of Mr. Eyerly, and explained away the incon&s;i&s;tancy of his te&s;timony. He &s;aid it was clear that John Fries, the pri&s;oner was an active and influential character through this dark &s;cene, in which he was recognized by all who were there, even by per&s;ons who had not known him before: he was not merely an aider and abettor of Trea&s;on, though that would have made him guilty of it, but a leading man; a conductor of the violence committed.</P>
<P>You will remember that when the mar&s;hal &s;ent forward a deputation to tho&s;e at the bridge, they were prevailed upon to halt, and attend to their propo&s;itions: when they agreed and promi&s;ed upon their honours not to pa&s;s the bridge until the return of their own deputation from the mar|&s;hal; though the hor&s;e did go over, yet the foot remained until the pri|&s;oner at the bar came up with his men. He in&s;tantly appeared the pro|minent, the active leader of the expedition; he &s;ettled the toll with the keeper, and they all went over. When Samuel Toon upbraided Cap|tain Staeler at Bethlehem with breaking his word and pa&s;&s;ing the bridge, his an&s;wer was we came over with Captain Fries and the Bucks county people. When the main body was coming up, he marched at the head of the footmen: when Mr. Mulhollen met them, the an&s;wer was receiv|ed from Fries. It was he who was appointed by them to go to the mar&s;hal. Here let me make a remark upon what has been dwelt upon as a circum&s;tance much in his favour; that is, that Fries always did his utmo&s;t toward the prevention of violence. Let not the merit of any man's actions be withheld: I agree in that with the council that he has avoided the effu&s;ion of human blood, and appeared to endeavour to pre|vent every &s;everity, &s;o far as was compatible with the accompli&s;hment of his purpo&s;e: Nay, I will &s;ay that Mr. Fries has &s;hewn an Urbanity and Humanity towards the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors in Bucks county which has done him credit and honour. But let us not forget that every fact which di&s;plays his humanity, at the &s;ame time e&s;tabli&s;hes his influences, and more&mdash;his authority over tho&s;e who were with him. When he came into the room where they were abu&s;ing Mr. Childs, he &s;ays "point out the man who committed this outrage and he &s;hall be puni&s;hed" when he was gone, they began upon Mr. Childs again. At Bethlehem, when he told the people not to go on yet, we find them obey him, and if he had carried it farther, they &s;till would have obeyed him. Thus you &s;ee, gentlemen in&s;tead of this rendering him a&s;&s;i&s;tance, it confirms his controul over them and makes him principal in the tran&s;action. Again, amid&s;t all his Ur|banity did he not execute the whole of his purpo&s;e? Did he not &s;ay "Foulke, you &s;hall be taken" notwith&s;tanding the re&s;pect he had before profe&s;&s;ed? Did he not, when he &s;aid to Mr. Childs he was very &s;orry, for what had happened, demand and obtain his papers? Did he not &s;ay to the mar&s;hal, my men &s;hall not hurt you, but I will have the pri&s;on|ers? As much as to &s;ay all this &s;hall be done as ea&s;y as po&s;&s;ible, but it &s;hall be done. While we admit his humanity on the one hand, we &s;till find it coupled with his purpo&s;e, his determination to obtain his object. Twelve witne&s;&s;es prove that the pri&s;oner was active at Bethlehem &s;o far then it is in full proof by &s;ix times the number the Con&s;titution calls for.

he came there from a great di&s;tance; he was indu&s;trious, and made a great Sacrifice of his own private intere&s;t to go there; he came out of his own county to accompli&s;h the general purpo&s;e for which they had a&s;&s;embled: he went there with all the in&s;ignia of military rank. I have ob&s;erved that he was emphatically the great &s;poke&s;man between the Mar&s;hal and the people, and therefore he alone was admitted up &s;tairs; he came out to explain to his men the &s;ucce&s;s of his emba&s;&s;y: that the mar&s;hal had &s;aid he could not comply: that he had arre&s;ted the&s;e people at the command of the judge, and at la&s;t, when the mar&s;hal told him he could not deliver them without force, he calls upon them to the on&s;et; he tells them he would be their leader; begs of them not to fire fir&s;t; tells them they mu&s;t go through an armed party on the &s;tairs, and if he &s;hould drop, they mu&s;t fire again, and do as well as they could for them&s;elves. In con&s;equence of his invitation, they went into the hou&s;e: and at that critical moment the mar&s;hal delivered up the pri&s;on|er to them, to prevent violence.</P>
<P>I need only refer you to the te&s;timony brought by the pri&s;oner to prove that he was con&s;tantly active in the grand bu&s;ine&s;s of oppo&s;ition through the whole cour&s;e. He wrote the paper at Kline's and at Fries' to in|vite them to go to Bethlehem; he warned the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors not to go on with their bu&s;ine&s;s, not even to another hou&s;e. He declared he had a great regard for them, but it was again&s;t the law he &s;hewed this hatred; to which he &s;aid he never would &s;ubmit. He defied the government, telling how many men he had ready. In conver&s;ation with Chapman, he told him the number he could rai&s;e; Chapman told him it was impo&s;&s;ible; that they could not cope with the number govern|ment would &s;end "we'll try then who is &s;tronge&s;t" he replied: He went away in a great pa&s;&s;ion when told that the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments going on, then, &s;aid he, it &s;hall &s;oon be as it is in France."He &s;eems to have anticipated all the horrors of a civil war; for when told of the con&s;e|quences, he &s;aid, if they once began, he knew not where it would end. He appeared to argue the point with as much zeal as though he thought he could prevail upon the government to de&s;i&s;t from enforcing the tax. "You &s;hall not go to another hou&s;e," he &s;aid: but finding they did go he attacked them at Singma&s;ter's, with a determination to take Rodrick pri&s;oner, but not taking him, he let Foulke go whom he had taken, and promi&s;ed to take them the next day, he took two of them the next day, but let them go on a promi&s;e to de&s;i&s;t from a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing; at the &s;ame time declaring his determination not to &s;ubmit to this law, but that it &s;hould be repealed. The party then re&s;olved to go to Bethlehem, but they did not &s;eparate, till he had procured from them their &s;ignatures to an engage|ment to go and accompli&s;h their purpo&s;e. When on the march to Bethle|hem, and met by young Marks, he was one who prevented their returning, and they actually did proceed, and got to Bethlehem, where this &s;cene concluded.</P>
<P>Here then gentlemen the evidence clo&s;es. We find this man is not of a yielding texture; he &s;till continued in his oppo&s;ition even at the time there was a recommendation to &s;ubmit to the laws: at a meeting Marks's it was determined to recommend &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the officers, and all the laws of the United States, and to <HI>desist from opposition to the laws.</HI> This is proof that there had been oppo&s;ition to the Laws in the three

counties. When the&s;e things were done Mitchell a&s;ked Fries if he ever did intend to oppo&s;e the laws. "Yes I did," was his an&s;wer.</P>
<P>In the te&s;timony of Mr. Roberts we have proved the general &s;tate of oppo&s;ition, as well as the guilt of the pri&s;oner: this witne&s;s was called by the pri&s;oner's council. To be &s;ure he proved the pri&s;oner's penitence and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. If he had not been guilty he could not have been penitent. He &s;aid he had not &s;lept for &s;everal nights: an acknowledgment &s;o much the more pertinent to prove that he had been doing what he knew was wrong.</P>
<P>Gentlemen of the Jury.&mdash;I have endeavoured to &s;how you this &s;ub|ject in all the points of view I am able, &s;o as to give you a right under|&s;tanding of the facts; and permit me to declare to you that I have not wilfully perverted either the law or the facts to the be&s;t of my know|ledge; yet it is po&s;&s;ible I may have done it, if &s;o you will be undeceived in tho&s;e particulars by the court.&mdash;Gentlemen, you have a &s;olemn duty to perform: we have all had a di&s;agreeable and tedious undertaking I pray you to do it in &s;uch a way as may do ju&s;tice to the pri&s;oner and the bar, and at the &s;ame time con&s;ider how much the happine&s;s, the peace, and tranquility of your country, depends upon a fair, impartial and con&s;cienti|ous verdict, which there is no doubt but you will deliver.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>With submission to your Honors. GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is now become my duty to addre&s;s you on behalf of the pri&s;oner at the bar, who is arraigned before you on the important i&s;&s;ue of Life or Death: I do it with the more confidence, becau&s;e I have not been able to learn from the council for the pro&s;ecution, a &s;ingle in&s;tance of Engli&s;h law that comes up to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, in good times or in bad times, &s;o as to denominate it Trea&s;on, except in a determination during the bloody reign of Henry VIII, and that is mentioned among the evils of the time: I have not been able to find it under any exi&s;ting circum&s;tances whatever, and yet any per&s;on who is the lea&s;t acquainted with Engli&s;h hi&s;tory or law, mu&s;t know that the exci&s;e law and the &s;hop tax, as well as &s;ome others, have led to riot and in&s;urrections, and a variety of trials have been held upon them. It may be right to make the experiment upon the pre&s;ent ca&s;e; but, unle&s;s this pro&s;ecution is warranted, e&s;tabli&s;hed in good times, and upon &s;olid grounds, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, but truth compels me to declare, that it is a burning torch in the hand of a madman; it is a flaming &s;word in the hand of a tyrant, and has done immen&s;e injury in England. I know there is no intention in the attorney in this ca&s;e, to do any thing that is wrong; yet I wi&s;h more reflection had been u&s;ed, before the pro&s;ecution had gone on. Thus it was in England re&s;pecting Hardy, Took, The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wel, and
<PB N="136" REF="037104_0140_100D855A92276A48">
others; tho&s;e who mo&s;t under&s;tood the whole of the charges were not &s;ati&s;fied to call their crime a mi&s;demeanour, though there was no direct point in ancient or modern law, warranting any other indictment, yet the experiment was tried, but an Engli&s;h <HI>jury</HI> appreciated it in its pro|per light, and they re&s;olved to do nothing which their ance&s;tors had not done, not even in the application of con&s;tructive trea&s;on; and therefore after a mature di&s;cu&s;&s;ion they returned a verdict of <HI>Not Guilty.</HI> When, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, the cau&s;es and proceedings are duly con&s;idered, I am &s;atisfied you will feel it a duty you owe to the pri&s;oner now be|fore you, and to your country, to pronounce a like verdict. It is not becau&s;e a circum&s;tance any way &s;imilar to this has once taken place, and been argued upon the &s;ame grounds, that therefore it is right it &s;hould take place upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion; adopting a principle of this kind has often made courts in arbitrary times, take gigantic &s;trides, over the &s;ta|tute of Edward III, &s;o that a man could not know how to look, act, &s;peak, or even think, without difficulty and danger. I have &s;aid that I am not able except during the mandatory reign of Henry VIII, to find the trace of a &s;ingle in&s;tance where re&s;cue, under any circum&s;tances what|ever, 'as been found to amount to trea&s;on, and if &s;ucceeding ages did not con&s;ider them&s;elves bound by that practice, I tru&s;t you will not &s;it here to e&s;tabli&s;h a law, but to give it &s;uch a con&s;truction as ju&s;tice de|mands of you. I have undertaken this cau&s;e the more readily, becau&s;e I do not undertake to ju&s;tify, to palliate, nor to excu&s;e; but I cen&s;ure the tran&s;actions which have given ri&s;e to this trial as much as the coun|cil for the pro&s;ecution does: I am &s;en&s;ible as they are, that tho&s;e peo|ple violated the law without cau&s;e; and I came not here to &s;et up a mock excu&s;e for them: No, it is my opinion that they merit exemplary puni&s;hment, but that puni&s;hment mu&s;t be conformable to <HI>law,</HI> or, when once the law is overturned, the con&s;equences will be incalculable; of|fences higher than the pre&s;ent may be committed with impunity by &s;ome, while tho&s;e of le&s;s grade will be &s;everely puni&s;hed in others. It is not for me to &s;ay that the pri&s;oner is entirely innocent: To me, to the court, and to you it is totally immaterial whether he has acted wi&s;ely or fooli&s;hly; guilty or innocently, if not guilty of the offence upon which he now &s;tands upon his deliverance. I may be a&s;ked here how I came to defend a man, who I admitted had violated the law, and in &s;ome degree &s;at the government at defiance. My rea&s;ons are the&s;e: It is the priviledge of every man to have a fair trial, and not to be con|demned without being heard, e&s;pecially in affairs of an highly criminal nature; few men are capable of defending them&s;elves before a court, and in a capital ca&s;e, from the perturbation of their minds, &s;till le&s;s &s;o than in any other: And woe betide that country, where a man &s;o charged &s;hould not be entitled to every a&s;&s;i&s;tance that he can procure. By the &s;tatute of William III, which is the fir&s;t that ever allowed coun|cil at all, the court were obliged to a&s;&s;ign council, who were obliged to render all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance in their power; the &s;ame is allowed by our act of Congre&s;s, (p. 112. Sect. 29.) for without that, he may be con&s;idered as condemned unheard, and the public mind would be left un&s;atisfied as to the innocence or guilt of the accu&s;ed. Tho&s;e who have entertain|ed the &s;urpri&s;e I have hinted at, at my being thus engaged, have doubt|le&s;s
<PB N="137" REF="037104_0141_100D855D221F5230">
acted from the bed of motives, but, not &s;atisfied with this, and wi&s;h|ing to &s;pill the blood of a man before he is proved guilty, &s;ome ca|lumniating &s;coundrel has, in a public print, had the hardihood, during the pre&s;ent trial, to impute to the unhappy pri&s;oner's council, the ba&s;e influence of gold, when all concerned know very well that the pri&s;oner has not a farthing to give, and not a farthing, nor even a promi&s;e of any, was ever given to tho&s;e who have undertaken his defence. I will &s;ay no more re&s;pecting this vile attempt, but that the law &s;ays no pub|lication &s;hall take place which may tend to influence a court or jury, while a trial is pending, and therefore it is an high contempt thrown upon the court, and upon you, and the probability is that either the author or the publi&s;her will be brought to an&s;wer for his conduct.</P>
<P>There is one thing, gentlemen, I would wi&s;h to caution you again&s;t: there are many citizens who &s;uppo&s;e that the troops will never turn out again unle&s;s a conviction takes place on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, and that an in&s;urrection will &s;oon appear again: but this is paying a poor compli|ment to our volunteer troops, to &s;uppo&s;e they would not be &s;atisfied without &s;hedding blood: Gentlemen, let no arguments or con&s;iderations have weight with you but what are &s;upported by law, and then decide, regardle&s;s of the con&s;equences. Another matter I would caution you again&s;t, is one with which I found very con&s;iderable difficulty to cope, but at length I diverted my&s;elf of it, and I pray you to do the &s;ame: I mean all kind of prejudice as to the party tried and trying. Our Con|&s;titution, and our laws, are wi&s;ely calculated to pre&s;erve the happine&s;s and intere&s;t of our&s;elves and po&s;terity: our Government is compo&s;ed of tried patriotic characters, and our political bark, with &s;uch men at the helm, need not tear a &s;torm; but notwith&s;tanding this, it is villified and abu&s;ed: The&s;e are grounds for prejudice to work upon, and it is diffi|cult, I can &s;ay by experience, to avoid its influence; but when we come to the &s;acred temple of Ju&s;tice, even if to decide between A and B, on a matter of trifling property, we are &s;worn to an impartial and unpre|judiced deci&s;ion; and how much more is it demanded of us in a ca&s;e of life and death? It is nece&s;&s;ary to enter that temple diverted of opinion or bias, otherwi&s;e there is not a fair &s;cope for our rea&s;onable faculties to act, nor can our con&s;ciences be acquitted of guilt. I will take the liberty of reminding you that your oath is "that you will well and tru|ly try, according to evidence;" this obliges you to expel every thing from your minds which you might have heard out of doors re&s;pecting the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of the in&s;urrection, excepting &s;uch only as is proved by the evidence. Your pre&s;ent &s;ituation, gentlemen, impo&s;es upon you a duty which is highly important; important as it concerns your coun|try, the pri&s;oner, and likewi&s;e your&s;elves: it concerns him, becau&s;e his life or death is, in &s;ome mea&s;ure placed in your hands; it is upon your verdict it depends whether he &s;hall continue with indu&s;try to &s;pend the remainder of his life with his family and friends, or whether he mu&s;t leave them all, and be &s;u&s;pended between heaven and earth to a gazing multitude. Your deci&s;ion is of importance to your country, becau&s;e we are now treading upon the dangerous, and, I had almo&s;t &s;aid, unbeaten ground of con&s;tructive trea&s;on, and becau&s;e it may and will operate as a precedent to future proceedings. Nor is it le&s;s important to your&s;elves
<PB N="138" REF="037104_0142_100D856198D1C668">
becau&s;e, if owing to hone&s;t intention, and mi&s;taken views you &s;hould go farther than a reflecting moment would dictate, in &s;ome circum&s;tance of a public nature which might <HI>possibly</HI> occur, the work would be irretrievably done, the reflection would come too late, and pardon would be out of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>I will now proceed to con&s;ider the particular offence imputed in the indictment to John Fries&punc; the pri&s;oner at the bar, by which he mu&s;t be convicted, if at all. [Mr. Lewis, here read the indictment.] To this indictment he has pleaded not guilty, and you are &s;worn to decide upon the i&s;&s;ue. The que&s;tion is not whether he has, or has not been guilty of a riot, or re&s;cue: he may have been guilty of an high mi&s;demeanor, of this or the other de&s;cription, but the que&s;tion is, has he ordered, pre|pared, and levied war again&s;t the United States? That is the language of our con&s;titution, and the act of congre&s;s formed thereupon. In order to in&s;ure the conviction of this man at all events, it has been &s;tated to you, and that with no &s;mall degree of confidence, that, as the framers of our con&s;titution have adopted the words of the Engli&s;h &s;tatute, the courts are bound to admit the expo&s;itions which have taken place upon it, from time to time in the Engli&s;h courts: though we have laws of our own, yet in order to know the true meaning of our con&s;titution we are to go back into the remote&s;t and mo&s;t dark ages of Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, to under&s;tand its meaning! The Engli&s;h &s;tatute, or the opinions of the courts of ju&s;tice are equally become part of the code in that country it is true, and it was as po&s;&s;ible for the framers of our con&s;titution to have extended the one as the other to this country, had they cho&s;en &s;o to do, but their not doing it, is a pre&s;umptive proof that it was not acceptable. To me it appears &s;trange that while the Engli&s;h &s;tatute is not in force here, the Engli&s;h con&s;truction of that &s;tatute &s;hould! that is a po&s;ition I never mean to &s;ub&s;cribe, but controvert it from the beginning to the end, of this ca&s;e. As we have enacted laws of our own, and have not ex|tended the laws of England to this country, we mu&s;t put our own con|&s;truction upon them, and not the determination of an Engli&s;h court. Neither the Engli&s;h laws, nor the opinions of Engli&s;h judges are to be regarded any farther than is con&s;i&s;tent with our good, to appreciate which the &s;ituation of the times when tho&s;e opinions were given, and whether the judges were dependant or independant are important con|&s;iderations. I do not mean to find fault with Engli&s;h deci&s;ions in gene|ral: I believe that with regard to property, &s;ince the judges have been rendered independant of the crown, it is as wi&s;ely admini&s;tered as the laws of any part of the globe are: but they were not always in a &s;itua|tion to give impartial opinions, when they held their &s;tation at the will of an arbitrary monarch, who could ha&s;ten or delay cau&s;es at his plea|&s;ure, to which the judges were the mo&s;t ob&s;equious tools. Such has been the deci&s;ions of &s;ome periods re&s;pecting trea&s;on. But it is not true that the very words of the Engli&s;h &s;tatute are adopted in our con|&s;titution; they very materially differ: the &s;tatute of Edward III, does not provide that confe&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be made in open court if received at all: it does not &s;pecify that two witne&s;&s;es &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;ta|bli&s;h the fact, but it was left to the court upon principles of common law<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> nor does it &s;ay a &s;ingle word about an <HI>overt act.</HI> Since, then, the
<PB N="139" REF="037104_0143_100D8563FA023840">
two &s;tatutes are &s;o di&s;&s;imilar in important points, it would be very wrong to admit of the &s;ame con&s;truction in both. So careful was our govern|ment of the lives of our citizens, viewing the injuries other countries had &s;u&s;tained by indefinite laws, they provided that the crime &s;hould be put in the indictment, and &s;upported by the te&s;timony of two witne&s;&s;es. In England there might be one witne&s;s to one overt act, and another to another.</P>
<P>But I &s;tall now proceed to &s;how what does, or what does not amount to levying war: in doing this, we are not to go back to corrupt times, under corrupt judges, nor do I think the ob&s;ervations of tho&s;e judges are in the lea&s;t obligatory upon our courts, but how far they will be re|&s;pected, in another que&s;tion; we may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured they will be regarded no farther than rea&s;on will &s;ugge&s;t. This I con&s;ider of importance, not only at pre&s;ent, but to po&s;terity. Mo&s;t of our laws, it mu&s;t be remember|ed, are from England, and were brought with our ance&s;tors as their birth-right: this was the ca&s;e wherever Briti&s;h &s;ubjects emigrated, but as &s;oon as we became independant &s;tates, we enacted laws of our own, although in a great degree copied from Briti&s;h &s;tates, but they became new under our con&s;titution.</P>
<P>I think gentlemen, I &s;hall be able to &s;hew you, upon the opinions of men &s;ound in law knowledge in England, that the definition of trea&s;on in our con&s;titution will not bear the con&s;truction that has been put up|on theirs at an early period. We have an expre&s;s and di&s;tinct meaning of this crime in our own acts of Congre&s;s. An act pa&s;&s;ed 1790 (Vol. 1, page 100). Sect 1 &s;hows what trea&s;on is, and particulari&s;es wherein it &s;hall con&s;i&s;t. Sect. 5 defines the puni&s;hment which &s;hould be inflict|ed on a re&s;cue of per&s;ons committed to cu&s;tody, or in the hands of the officer. But there was another act pa&s;&s;ed defining the preci&s;e circum|&s;tances attending this ca&s;e, this was pa&s;&s;ed after the declaration of the judges on the ca&s;e of the we&s;tern in&s;urrection, and from its being enact|ed &s;ub&s;equent to all others upon this &s;pecies of crime, appears to me to be binding upon our courts: I mean the Sedition act. It appears to reach the pre&s;ent ca&s;e in the fulle&s;t extent; the language of that act is, whoever &s;hall combine or con&s;pire, &amp;c. &s;hall be guilty of a high mi&s;demea|nor: this act does not &s;pecify the number: a town&s;hip, a county, or twelve counties equally is within the law. Combining to <HI>prevent</HI> the execu|tion of the law: this reaches the action, whatever may be the number or force u&s;ed: it is a <HI>misdemeanor</HI> and &s;hall be puni&s;hed with <HI>fine</HI> and <HI>im|prisonment,</HI> not death. Whether the object &s;hall or &s;hall not be effected, the law &s;ays the puni&s;hment &s;hall be the &s;ame. Here then is a &s;olemn declaration made by the legi&s;lature it&s;elf, the &s;ame body that enacted the puni&s;hment of death to what they termed trea&s;on by a prior law, and &s;urely that authority had the greate&s;t right to put a con&s;truction on, or make an alteration in their on law. If there is a legal definition of the crime committed by the pri&s;oner at the bar, this act contains it: every ca&s;e is here provided for by the puni&s;hment of fine and impri&s;on|ment, and had a pro&s;ecution taken place under this act, a conviction would have been certain, and the puni&s;hment would have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gorous, and exemplary.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="037104_0144_100D7E304DD6E478">
Under this head of Engli&s;h con&s;truction, I would a&s;k how it can ap|ply to us, when we con&s;ider that before the act of William III, no per|&s;on charged with high trea&s;on was allowed council to plead for him, unle&s;s he &s;tated &s;ome objection in point of law which made an argument nece&s;&s;ary, and even then he could not do it without fir&s;t admitting the truth of the fact charged again&s;t him, and yet all the deci&s;ions of Engli&s;h courts alluded to were formed before that period! Further. Not only was the accu&s;ed not allowed council, but if he had hundreds of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable witne&s;&s;es to prove the fal&s;ity of the allegations, he never had a right to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing them forward untill the reign of William III. The&s;e deci&s;ions, gentlemen, of the Engli&s;h courts, which are called up as pre|cedents for us to regard, were formed under the&s;e arbitrary circum&s;tances: No council allowed even though the pri&s;oner was deaf and dumb, nor witne&s;&s;es, if he could even prove he was hundreds of miles di&s;tant at the time. Further, to &s;how what dependance can be placed on the &s;ayings of the&s;e men, you will ob&s;erve that untill the time of William III. all the judges held their commi&s;&s;ions during royal plea&s;ure only, and even untill the fir&s;t of George III, the judges were never compleatly indepen|dant, and of cour&s;e were obliged to &s;tudy the royal plea&s;ure; their opi|nions being extorted before the trial commenced. The con&s;equence of all this is plain, that no impartial opinion could be given. It was com|mon before trial fir&s;t to clo&s;et the&s;e dependant judges and bring them to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, if their opinions ran counter. Bacon, the greate&s;t, wi&s;e&s;t, but meane&s;t of mankind, thus &s;tooped to become the tool of his ma&s;ter. Tho&s;e who could not thus be brought over were de&s;pi&s;ed, and more ob|&s;equious per&s;ons placed in their room, and it was not 'till they could have a deci&s;ion thus formed that per&s;ons were brought on their trial for high trea&s;on. And yet we are referred to the&s;e per&s;ons to tell us what is the meaning of our own &s;tatute on trea&s;on! Thus it was that many of the be&s;t citizens of England fell a &s;acrifice, and for no other purpo&s;e, many of them, than becau&s;e they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed exalted virtue. During the exi&s;tence of this &s;tate of things, the judges would &s;et &s;ilent on their bench during a trial for life, and hear the crown officers, in&s;tead of acts and expre&s;&s;ions of humanity to the unhappy pri&s;oner, abu&s;e him with the mo&s;t opprobrious and in&s;ulting language. Influenced by this mean|ne&s;s, Sir Edward Coke, while attorney general, de&s;cended to abu&s;e the great and good Sir Walter Raleigh, with the vile epithets of <HI>Traitor, Viper</HI> and <HI>Spider of hell,</HI> &amp;c. turning away from him with the greate&s;t &s;corn: and this was the manner in which trials were commonly manag|ed. See Fo&s;ter, 234.</P>
<P>It was well known that the &s;tatute of Edward III, made no provi&s;ion whatever re&s;pecting the charging of an overt act in the indictment, nor does it &s;ay any thing about proof, but a &s;tatute enacted in the reign of Edward VI, made two witne&s;&s;es nece&s;&s;ary in ca&s;es of high trea&s;on, but Fo&s;ter &s;ays no great regard was paid to this better &s;tatute 'till near a century after, and the rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned was that it was not for the &s;afe|ty of the crown, or to the common well known rules of legal evidence. It was common to admit one witne&s;s of his own knowledge, and ano|ther by hear&s;ay, if it was even from the mouth of that one, and at the third or fourth hand, and frequently the depo&s;itions were taken out of

court to be read, rather than bring them into open court. This mu&s;t appear an uncommon repre&s;entation of the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, but it is a fair picture of the times under which the deci&s;ions took place which are brought again&s;t us. At the period in which the &s;even bi&s;hops were tried, lord Cambden declares that ju&s;tice Powel was the only hone&s;t man that &s;at on the bench. Ble&s;&s;ed ju&s;tice! I know that &s;ince the judges have become independant men in England, there has been as much independance in their conduct as in any country; but then, as Hale tells us, the&s;e deci&s;ions had already taken place, and therefore they mu&s;t Seabode by; but he takes care to caution future judges how they introduc|ed new ca&s;es by putting new con&s;tructions. The que&s;tion now is, whe|ther this court and jury are prepared to be bound by judges thus princi|pled and thus circum&s;tanced, to form a deci&s;ion upon <HI>our own law.</HI> I contend that the&s;e deci&s;ions are by no means binding upon us, we have the &s;edition law, which comprehends the whole ca&s;e. In 1 Hale 132, and 1 Black&s;tone 69, it appears to be lamented that the independant judges of later days have no power to alter the rules of law e&s;tabli&s;hed in the dark ages of Engli&s;h juri&s;prudence, otherwi&s;e, we have rea&s;on to believe, they would not be in exi&s;tence at this day. Lord Kenyon, when council for lord George Gordon, declared, that he did not think the parliament of Edward III, ever had any de&s;ign that con&s;tructive trea|&s;on &s;hould exi&s;t at all, or any wi&s;h to leave room for it to be introduced. We are certainly, therefore, unentrammelled by every foreign rule, otherwi&s;e the que&s;tion would be, what rules we &s;hould adopt, and what not. It is a rule in law that &s;tatutes affecting life, &s;hould never extend beyond the letter of the law, &s;o as to leave the po&s;&s;ibility of a doubt. If that is a rule re&s;pecting penal &s;tatutes in general, abundant more &s;o is it nece&s;&s;ary re&s;pecting the high crime of trea&s;on. Above all things, if bad times &s;hould even happen in this country, and bad times may come here as well as they have in all other countries, it will be of va&s;t import|ance that the law &s;hould be known preci&s;ely: it will be of con&s;equence to a citizen to know on what law he is to be tried, if he becomes the devoted object of any one's re&s;entment, or commits a crime: it is of con&s;equence that the flood gates of u&s;urpation and tyranny &s;hould never be left open, and the liberties of our citizens be thrown away <HI>ad libitum</HI> on the uncertain ground of con&s;truction. 1 Black&s;tone 88. Fo&s;ter 58. we read that it ought to be "clearer than life it&s;elf."</P>
<P>We now come to examine the true, full, ju&s;t, and rea&s;onable meaning of our own trea&s;on &s;tatute; for I do not admit that con&s;tructive trea&s;on ought to exi&s;t at all. A line is drawn, and if we ever cro&s;s it, where are we to &s;top? Trea&s;on again&s;t the United States, we find, con&s;i&s;ts in "levying war again&s;t them, &amp;c." The que&s;tion is, what is levying war? Levying war may fairly extend to the three following things:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. Where a body of men take up arms, and array them&s;elves in a mar&s;hal manner again&s;t the government, with a view to put an end to its exi&s;tence. This is its plain natural meaning, but cannot be &s;aid to have been tran&s;acted by the pri&s;oner at the bar, and therefore requires no farther definition.</P>
<P>Secondly. It is expre&s;sly levying war, if a part of the union, throw off all allegiance and authority of the United States, totally di&s;regarding
<PB N="142" REF="037104_0146_100D856A62552B58">
its laws and in&s;titutions, and act as a divided people as though they did not belong to them.</P>
<P>Thirdly. Where laws have been enacted by the union, pur&s;uant to the Con&s;titution of the United States, and a number of people, being di&s;|&s;atisfied, &s;hould, of their own authority, by numbers, or force of arms, take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the legi&s;lative or executive authority, and by this force of arms or numbers &s;hould undertake to compel either of the departments of government to act as they dictate, thus robbing the government of its legitimate power, by a&s;&s;uming it them&s;elves.</P>
<P>No doubt the good of po&s;terity was intended in the con&s;titutional de|finition of trea&s;on, and we are to touch it with a trembling hand indeed, le&s;t it moulder, and grow into, God knows what. Now, as this is an act which was deliberately formed, if we go upon the dangerous ground of con&s;truction, that cannot be done &s;o deliberate: No, I &s;ay it was to be handed down pure to po&s;terity, and we ought not even to depart from a letter of it. If liberty of con&s;truction is to take place in any degree, by &s;o much it tends to render the con&s;titution vague and uncertain, and we know not where it will end. If the con&s;titution only intended the three definitions of levying war which I have laid down, it is clear that a man cannot over&s;tep tho&s;e con&s;titutional limits without intending to do it. Go beyond this, and you leave jurors and judges to make the con&s;titution any thing and nothing: a mere no&s;e of wax, to be moulded into any form at their will, and they may be excu&s;ed, becau&s;e left to exerci&s;e their own judgment upon it, but lord Hale has charged you not to do this, even though encouraged by a parity of rea&s;oning: agreea|ble to his apprehen&s;ions, it is deducible that if ever we have a bad pre|&s;ident, pre&s;idential encroachment may wre&s;t the con&s;titution to every thing that may &s;erve any particular purpo&s;e. But God forbid either &s;hould ever happen.</P>
<P>Stating the&s;e as expre&s;sly levying of war, (and I know of no other) I call upon the pro&s;ecutors to produce a &s;ingle in&s;tance, except in the incon&s;i&s;tent reign of Henry VIII, wherein the re&s;cue of one or more pri&s;oners, by one or more people, has ever been &s;aid to amount to trea|&s;on. I may go farther, and a&s;k tho&s;e gentlemen whether a refu&s;al to obey the law, and re&s;i&s;t the officers who came to execute it has ever been called trea&s;on but by them&s;elves? We find that <HI>universality,</HI> a de|&s;ign to pull down <HI>all</HI> pri&s;ons, &amp;c. is requi&s;ite to make the offence trea|&s;on: it is only a general oppo&s;ition to the government. But why are we to look for univer&s;ality if we are to take a ca&s;e like this, and call it trea&s;on? If an officer of the government, (agreeable to this doctrine) goes to execute proce&s;s, and that proce&s;s is re&s;i&s;ted by one individual, does he not deny the authority of the government? Yes, as much &s;o as though 50 or 100 were engaged in it: the whole intent the <HI>mal amens</HI> being exerci&s;ed to re&s;i&s;t it, it becomes trea&s;on. The offence now char|ged con&s;titutes nothing more nor le&s;s than oppo&s;ition to legal authority. The pulling down of a &s;ingle meeting hou&s;e, a &s;ingle brothel, or a &s;ingle pri&s;on, was not allowed to be a denial of the authority of the government in antient u&s;age, but when it was done with a general intent, it became trea&s;on. Now we contend that except the univer&s;ality and generality of de&s;ign in the act charged can be pointed out, it does not amount to
<PB N="143" REF="037104_0147_100D856CC1E80D68">
trea&s;on. When I &s;aid I know of no ca&s;e whatever when re&s;i&s;ting the exe|cution of law amounted to trea&s;on, I &s;hould have mentioned the excep|tion of re&s;i&s;ting the <HI>militia</HI> law: this mu&s;t be con&s;idered in a light of re&s;i&s;ting the army, becau&s;e it is part of the general army that this law provides, and oppo&s;ing the army in any way would be trea&s;on, but re|&s;i&s;ting or oppo&s;ing any other laws is only a mi&s;demeanor, except an at|tempt be made to &s;ubvert all laws. Gentlemen, I repeat the exhorta|tion; beware of con&s;tructive trea&s;on; it is a dangerous thing to admit into our tribunals; it is like the &s;cythe of death, levelling alike the great and &s;mall, the guilty and innocent: whoever reads its hi&s;tory will &s;ee war, famine and pe&s;tilence; a dangerous di&s;ea&s;e without a medicine to cure it: beware how you e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;y&s;tem in which your progeny, as well as your&s;elves, are materially intere&s;ted. If it were po&s;&s;ible for po&s;|terity to glance an eye on the proceedings of this day, no doubt but they would wonder, and await the important event with anxiety: It is put|ting your liberties into the hands of tyrants, if tyrants &s;hould ever torment this country, to prevent which you are now called upon to e&s;tabli&s;h a rule for preventing inju&s;tice, &s;hould inju&s;tice ever appear. Monte&s;quie &s;ays 4 Black&s;tone 75</P>
<P>The rea&s;on of this is plain; it is the point made u&s;e of by a govern|ment when it becomes corrupt, and &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed, by taking advan|tage of its power, to injure the people. Where con&s;tructive trea&s;on is not allowed, there can be no ground for apprehen&s;ion from that dange|rous weapon. But we are told that by adopting the words of the &s;ta|tute of Edward III, (which is not the ca&s;e) we have admitted all the authorities of the courts of Great Britain. This I deny, we read the con&s;equences of &s;uch a proceeding throughout the Engli&s;h books: See Keeling 7. Hale 134. 4 Black&s;tone 75, 79, 80. When once this dan|gerous principle was introduced, the courts &s;oon ran to enormous ex|tremes: and &s;hould you pronounce the pri&s;oner guilty to morrow, it would be the e&s;tabli&s;hed law of the United States, &s;o far as a jury could do it. But there is one thing worthy of your notice: the parliament of Edward III, from the experience they had, defined trea&s;on in as clear terms as they could, they did not know but new ca&s;es might ari&s;e, in which ca&s;e they provided what no hone&s;t judge could object to; they provided that if new ca&s;es &s;hould ari&s;e, the judges &s;hould not call it trea&s;on untill the the parliament had determined it to be &s;o; &s;o extremely were they afraid of con&s;tructive trea&s;on that they would not tru&s;t a judge, even if there was a &s;imilarity to former ca&s;es, nothing was to be left to con&s;truction, or be called trea&s;on by the courts but direct levying of war. But the parliaments were &s;o much under the crown that it could have been more &s;afely tru&s;ted to the courts. However we are not bound either by the &s;tatutes of Edward III, or William III, becau&s;e, as I &s;tated before, they are not in force here, much le&s;s the deci&s;ion of the judges or the parlia|ments under them: We mu&s;t put a con&s;truction upon our own &s;tatute, alone confining it to the expre&s;s word of levying war. This is an im|portant que&s;tion, and you are required to deliberate fairly and fully, un|influenced in any manner whatever, but by your con&s;ciences.</P>
<P>Judge Hale 1 p 131 makes di&s;tinction between expre&s;s and con&s;tructive trea&s;on: you will there &s;ee that the time when con&s;tructive trea&s;on began

and flouri&s;hed, was in tho&s;e dark, gloomy, trouble&s;ome and bloody days, when England was drenched with the blood of her be&s;t citizens; when the &s;oil was enriched with their gore, and yet to authorities pa&s;&s;ed at &s;uch times are we referred by the council for the pro&s;ecution, and upon tho&s;e authorities are we to place our Con&s;titutional definition of trea|&s;on. Enhancing &s;ervants wages was one of the ca&s;es tho&s;e gentlemen relied on, and we admit that it was denominated trea&s;on to ri&s;e for that purpo&s;e. Suppo&s;ing that con&s;truction was not pronounced by the king or by his judges, but by the mo&s;t upright deci&s;ion, how might it operate on this ca&s;e? Why, we admit that wherever a body of men in arms go and &s;urround the legi&s;lative or executive authority, to compel the repeal of a law, it would be levying war: the wages of &s;ervants in tho&s;e days was fixed by act of Parliament, and it could not be enhanced legally, but by an act to do it, and therefore any armed mob, going for the purpo&s;e of obtaining this object, is a trea&s;onable a&s;&s;embly, becau&s;e the object is to compel parliament to alter the law. Another definition re|ferred to, is the pulling down inclo&s;ures, pri&s;ons, &amp;c. generally. In referrence to that I would a&s;k if the one now before the court is not a new ca&s;e? If it is not I am at a lo&s;s to find a new ca&s;e. It has even been held that any number of men a&s;&s;embled to re&s;cue any number of per&s;ons, provided they did not go with a view of pro&s;trating all pri&s;on|ers, and relea&s;ing pri&s;oners generally, is only a great riot. It is a new ca&s;e in England, and it is &s;o here, and therefore ought to be cautiou&s;ly handled. 6 Hume 402. in the ca&s;e of Lord Stafford.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed more particularly to &s;tate my rea&s;ons for alledg|ing that the crimes with which the pri&s;oner is charged are fully com|prehended, and puni&s;hment provided for them in the Sedition law. This I &s;hall con&s;ider fir&s;t, as it relates to the re&s;cue independantly. Secondly I &s;hall make &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the law, independant of the re&s;cue, and thirdly, both together.</P>
<P>It is admitted, that the mere re&s;cue of the per&s;ons from the cu&s;tody of the mar&s;hal at Bethlehem, would not amount to trea&s;on, and it would not be nece&s;&s;ary for me to &s;ay a word about that were, it not for the following rea&s;ons. Speaking of pulling down meeting hou&s;es, brothels, pri&s;ons, &amp;c. the crime is defined: 4 Black&s;tone 129, "offences again&s;t public ju&s;tice, is ob&s;tructing the execution of lawful proce&s;s." This, there can be no doubt, is an offence at common law, and per&s;ons found guilty of a re&s;cue of a per&s;on convicted of a crime, is adjudged guilty of the &s;ame crime, and would be puni&s;hable accordingly, had it not been for our act of Congre&s;s, (the Sedition act) but that act reduces a re&s;cue, generally, to mi&s;demeanor. Bat agreeable to law, per&s;ons re&s;cuing others not committed for trea&s;on, does not amount to trea&s;on. A ca&s;e in 4 Black&s;tone 86. the party him&s;elf was guilty of felony at common law by making e&s;cape, but I believe it to be an entire new doctrine to make the offence of the acce&s;&s;ories or a&s;&s;i&s;tants higher than tho&s;e who are re&s;cued: Re&s;cue of per&s;ons for felony has been always felony, trea|&s;on, trea&s;on, &amp;c. I think therefore it is clear to prove that every exer|tion has been u&s;ed to attempt to make trea&s;on of this crime, by the gentlemen, but it is as clear that they have &s;earched and tried in vain.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="037104_0149_100D85728638AE90">
But it is farther &s;aid, that this bu&s;ine&s;s a&s;&s;umed a generality, and that the object was to defeat a law of the United States, for which purpo&s;e a number combined and con&s;pired together, and more effec|tually to accompli&s;h this they re&s;cued the pri&s;oners, and therefore com|mitted trea&s;on. Were I to admit this I might call upon the gentle|man to &s;upport his conclu&s;ions by authority, to &s;how that preventing the execution of proce&s;s, or relea&s;ing pri&s;oners before they were carri|ed to jail, is trea&s;on. I repeat that the only ca&s;e mentioned is in the di&s;graceful days of Henry VIII. which I think is inadmi&s;&s;ible. But I deny the fact: I deny that there was any combination or con&s;pira|cy between the people of lower Milford in Northampton county and tho&s;e of Bucks county at all upon the bu&s;ine&s;s. Fir&s;t, the people of both counties were alike aver&s;e to this law, and for &s;imilar rea&s;ons. I believe there are many unprincipled men who wi&s;h to injure their country, and go about preaching up &s;edition to the people, which com|municated in different directions, catch fire in the &s;ame manner, and perhaps at nearly one period; hence it is that their prejudices and oppo&s;ition may appear from the &s;ame cau&s;e, without parties holding the lea&s;t corre&s;pondence. I a&s;k you whether there is a tittle of evi|dence to prove that ever the pri&s;oner went into Northampton county till this circum&s;tance occurred? was there any communication by writing, or any other way? no, not at all. Upon what foundation can a conjecture ari&s;e then, that there was a combination? You are not to try by conjecture, or wild &s;uppo&s;ition: No, you are &s;worn to "well and truly try according to evidence." Does it appear, I a&s;k you to recollect, gentlemen of the jury, that he was in&s;tigated to this conduct by any intercour&s;e in any way held with Northampton coun|ty? No, it does not; but there is a &s;trong pre&s;umption that the di&s;|contents took root and grew to that &s;tate without any combination at all. But whether or not trea&s;on was committed in Milford town&s;hip, is not for you at pre&s;ent to &s;ay; the overt act is laid at Bethlehem, and there it mu&s;t be proved, that he levyed war upon the United States with a number, or by force &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> with them he combined and con&s;pired, &amp;c. If he did this at all, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> did it on the 7th of March, for it does not appear that he ever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> there before in his life; now if there was a con&s;piracy, it mu&s;t appear that he acted previou&s;ly and in concert with others, and the act would have been alike chargeable to all; but this does not appear. It is true Fries was heard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ay <Q>we will oppo&s;e you, and all the people of Northampton will join us,</Q> but this could ea&s;ily ari&s;e from his ha|ving heard that the people of Northampton were di&s;&s;atified with the law, but it doe&s; not fellow that, becau&s;e there were di&s;contents in Northampton county, he &s;hould be re&s;pon&s;ible for their actions, parti|cularly &s;ince it all, at lea&s;t, depends upon conjecture. Keeling 19 has a ca&s;e to an&s;wer this, where rebellion exi&s;ted in two parts at one time, but it was determined that this might happen without corre&s;|pondence, &s;ince no &s;uch evidence appeared, and therefore no notice was taken of it. Then, gentlemen, if I were for a moment to admit that John Fries had committed trea&s;on in Bucks county, which I deny, it would be immaterial upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, becau&s;e upon every
<PB N="146" REF="037104_0150_100D7E32549CB008">
indictment for trea&s;on, the overt act mu&s;t be proved in the county. But it is &s;aid that doctrine does not apply, each &s;tate being to the whole United States, as a county to the &s;tate, becau&s;e the grand jury have the di&s;trict at large to inquire for; and therefore it is immaterial whether laid in one county or the other. If this be &s;ound law, dread|ful indeed mu&s;t be the &s;ituation of the people of the United States, if the government &s;hould ever fall into different hands from the&s;e in which it is now happily placed, becau&s;e an attorney may, at any time, keep a per&s;on, arraigned for a capital offence, in ignorance, till he comes to the place of trial, and of cour&s;e not be prepared to repel it at a ve|ry di&s;tant place from where the act is laid. But this, I will be bold to &s;ay, cannot be law. My rea&s;ons for thinking &s;o are, Fir&s;t, the law of Congre&s;s called the judiciary act, &s;ect. 29, vol. 1. page 67, &s;ays, that in ca&s;es puni&s;hable with death, the trial &s;hall be had in the county where the offence was committed:" here I would remark that the law takes notice, not of a State or a di&s;trict, but of a county, and therefore the analogy drawn by Mr. Sitgreaves, that a di&s;trict to the United States, is the &s;ame as a county to a &s;tate, is not in point. The trial is to be had in the county unle&s;s the judges &s;hall determine that it cannot be had there without great inconvenience, (See Fo&s;ter 194) but let the of|fence be where it may, twelve jurors mu&s;t be &s;ummoned from the county, &s;ee 237 of the &s;ame book: if we examine the&s;e authorities they will appear different from what they were repre&s;ented. 2 Haw|kins C 46, &s;ect. 34, is an authority to prove that upon a plea of not guilty to a &s;pecific charge as to place, &amp;c. in an indictment, if the lea&s;t variance appears from that place, it is &s;ufficient to acquit the party, and is fatal to the pro&s;ecution. It is not nece&s;&s;ary for me again to &s;ay that you are totally to exclude from your views whatever the pri&s;oner did in Bucks county, &s;ince the charge is laid in Northampton, and &s;ince an acquittal from that charge will not prevent a pro&s;ecution in Bucks county. If it appears that no trea&s;on was committed by him on the 7th of March at Bethlehem, you mu&s;t pronounce him not guilty.</P>
<P>Mr. Lewis then reviewed the te&s;timony of Dellinger on the cir|cum&s;tances which led to the expedition to Bethlehem, which he con|tended had nothing to do with it, &s;ave the <HI>quo animo.</HI> It appeared that they heard Shankwieler was to be there, but it is not pretended that going there upon that account would be trea&s;on, and particular|ly as Shankwieler was not in cu&s;tody, and it does not appear that the pri&s;oner knew of any others being there at that time. Then the ob|ject particularly was to &s;ee Shankwieler. When they came to the bridge, it appeared to them that two men were detained at Bethele|hem, and it &s;eems they went forward to re&s;cue them. In this they were ju&s;tifiable; for if the law was violated, it was by Major Nicholls, in making an arre&s;t which the law did not authorize him him to do. They were illegally detained, and it was lawful for any body to go and re&s;cue them. 2 Lord Raymond, 1301. I am not di&s;po&s;ed to blame the mar&s;hal; but I cannot ju&s;tify him in point of law: his &s;itu|ation, no doubt, rendered it a prudent mea&s;ure; but it was detain|ing men by fal&s;e impri&s;onment, and was enough to alarm all the peo|ple of the &s;tate. I mention the circum&s;tance only to prove that there can be no re&s;cue, unle&s;s the per&s;ons liberated are legally confined.
<PB N="147" REF="037104_0151_100D7E34BB1F19F0">
In&s;tead of Fries being guilty for that action, a very worthy man (the mar&s;hal) was guilty of a&s;&s;ault and battery in the act of detention. If this is fact, how does the affair &s;tand afterwards re&s;pecting univer&s;ali|ty and de&s;ign? I have ju&s;tified Fries and the others in leaving the bridge to go up to Bethlehem, and the laws of their country will ju&s;|tify them, becau&s;e it does not appear that they knew the&s;e people were di&s;charged. When they got to Bethlehem, it appeared there were a number of per&s;ons under arre&s;t; for, it does not at all appear in evidence that they ever heard before that Fox, Ireman, or the Lehi pri&s;oners, were there: The gentlemen on the other &s;ide only pre&s;ume it; but you, gentlemen, mu&s;t not go upon pre&s;umption. <Q>You mu&s;t well and truly try, and true deliverance make, according to evi|dence.</Q> It does not appear they knew of it; they came from a great di&s;tance, and from quite another part of the country than where the Bucks county people came from; Fox and Ireman had been ju&s;t brought in, and none of them knew they were there: however, when they were got there, <HI>upon a lawful occasion,</HI> hearing of a number of per&s;ons being confined there, and that they were to be taken to Phila|delphia for what they con&s;idered to be no crime, they generally waxed warm, but Fries was cool, he endeavoured to pacify them: he had brought his &s;word with him, but when he was appointed an emba&s;&s;ador of peace to treat with the mar&s;hal, he left it behind him.</P>
<P>The who&s;e of the tran&s;action mu&s;t be viewed as a &s;udden affray, like numerous ca&s;es mentioned in Hale, Fo&s;ter, &amp;c. where great and &s;udden riots aro&s;e. Where is the proof, I a&s;k, of combination, of a&s;|&s;ociation or of corre&s;pondence? None at all: they came there to a man without the lea&s;t trea&s;onable views, for it was merely by chance they came there at all. There was much rage among the people upon the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions, the knowledge of the pri&s;oners in cu&s;tody made, and had it not been for the cool conduct of the pri&s;oner at the bar, blood and ma&s;&s;acre would have been the immediate con&s;equences, for no doubt liquor was operating pretty much in their brains. An alterca|tion took place: they in&s;i&s;ted on the pri&s;oners, and in the pro&s;ecution of his delegation, from the preremptory demands of the people, he made u&s;e of language which I admit was unju&s;tifiable, and violating the law, for which he ought to be puni&s;hed, but not with <HI>death.</HI> 1 Hale 153. But further: the per&s;ons were not in pri&s;on, they were only in cu&s;tody of the mar&s;hal: the&s;e are materially di&s;tinct; the relea&s;ing of per|&s;ons taken to pri&s;on, is only a mi&s;demeanor while relea&s;ing them af|ter they are in pri&s;on, which is in &s;ome mea&s;ure the &s;anctuary of the law, is felony: 4 Black&s;tone 130. The breaking open of pri&s;ons ge|nerally is trea&s;on, but in no ca&s;e is the relea&s;ing pri&s;oners before they are taken there. Keeling 75.63. Lord Gordon's trial, Demarree's ca&s;e 4 &s;late trials 844 and 900. It would not have been trea&s;on, therefore, if a number of per&s;ons had actually con&s;pired to re&s;cue the&s;e pri&s;oners from the mar&s;hal, nor even if they had been confined in a gaol, in&s;tead of a room, becau&s;e it was not a general de&s;ign to break open all pri&s;ons, but one only: but on the contrary they were not in pri&s;on they were only in cu&s;tody of the officer who &s;erved the proce&s;s; how then, in the name of rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e will it be made to

amount to trea&s;on when it would not, if they had been in gaol. But &s;ays the gentlemen, we will not call it re&s;cuing of pri&s;oners, but a ge|neral ob&s;truction of the execution of the law, and the means here u&s;ed was to &s;upport that general object. The re&s;cue is of it&s;elf a &s;pecific offence, and of it&s;elf admitted by Mr. Sitgreaves to be only a mi&s;de|meanor. If it is &s;o, how is it po&s;&s;ible to convert a mi&s;demeanor into a trea&s;on, and thus to take away the life of a man when impri&s;onment only is his de&s;ert! But what ground is there alledged for this po&s;ition? It is &s;aid that the arming and arraying a number of men was with this intent. I deny the fact, and it has by no means been proved. The ca&s;es referred to in England are trea&s;on to a demon&s;tration. Enhan&s;ing &s;ervant wages could not be done by force but by &s;urround|ing the parliament hou&s;e, and this was ju&s;tly denominated waging war again&s;t the king. Any ri&s;ing to alter religion mu&s;t be effected the &s;ame way: Religion is e&s;tabli&s;hed by law in England, and tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> law mu&s;t be altered by the parliament, therefore it could not be forcibly al|tered but by levying war. 4 Black&s;tone 81.

Not only open rebellion, but re&s;i&s;ting the laws as enacted is trea&s;on. The laws are a proof of the authority of the commonwealth, and re&s;i&s;ting tho&s;e laws is making the parties inde|pendant of the commonwealth, and therefore a defiance of the authori|ty of the &s;tate. Lord Mansfield in the charge on the &s;ame trial &s;ays, among other enumerations, that combinations, &amp;c. to arre&s;t the execu|tion of <HI>militia laws</HI> is trea&s;on. This &s;trongly merits ob&s;ervation. Why does the learned and experienced Lord Mansfield particularly &s;pe|cify militia laws and no other? Why does he not &s;ay to arre&s;t the exe|cution of any law? Why the militia law? For the be&s;t of all rea&s;ons, the &s;ame rea&s;on as the taking or attacking a fort or a cattle belong|ing to the king, becau&s;e that is the place where he keeps his military forces, and becau&s;e the military is the &s;trength of the kingdom, and this is re&s;i&s;ting the military authority. Therefore it mu&s;t be allowed that a re&s;i&s;tance of militia laws are upon a very different footing than any others, and in time of danger re&s;i&s;ting this law would prevent the militia being drawn into the field when there is occa&s;ion for them.</P>
<P>Now, gentlemen, the&s;e things all con&s;idered plainly &s;how that what is now attempted is a <HI>novel experiment,</HI> like modern philo&s;ophy, an entire new thing, &s;aving the &s;olitary in&s;tance in the reign of Henry VIII, and it is clear that the re&s;i&s;tance of no law is trea&s;on, but the militia law. I agree al&s;o with the doctrine Lord Mansfield lays down that any attempt to oppo&s;e the laws by <HI>intimidation</HI> and <HI>violence</HI> is levying war, and trea&s;on.</P>
<P>It is unnece&s;&s;ary for me to turn to the books to prove that confe&s;|&s;ion of the party, or words &s;poken by him, taken perhaps in the time of fear, are not to be regarded by you. This was &s;o plainly improper, that the law of William III, making two witne&s;&s;es nece&s;&s;ary, or con|fe&s;&s;ion in open court, was enacted: I need only turn to our own laws (judiciary act.) There mu&s;t be one of two kinds of proof: the party in open court mu&s;t confe&s;s, for confe&s;&s;ion out of court cannot avail even if made before 10,000 witne&s;&s;es: or el&s;e two witne&s;&s;es mu&s;t prove
<PB N="149" REF="037104_0153_100D7E38F88FACE0">
the &s;ame overt act, and he mu&s;t be convicted upon that indictment, if any. If you are to go to all parts of the country for heated words, heard by any body, in any circum&s;tances, I mu&s;t con&s;ider it as a very &s;candalous abu&s;e of the &s;tatute of Edward III. I think it impo&s;&s;ible to he&s;itate at what was the meaning of Congre&s;s when they made this act, and therefore &s;hall barely recur to the evidence.</P>
<P>Here is a proof, that the pri&s;oner came up to Bethlehem, where he acted in a certain manner; but the gentlemen concerned for the pro|&s;ecution, think that does not &s;ufficiently indicate his de&s;ign, and there|fore they travel to Jacob Fries's, to Kline's, and a number of other places: now &s;uppo&s;e you convict him, I intreat you to inquire from what evidence you do convict him? Is it from the overt act commit|ted at Bethlehem, or from that and other circum&s;tances together? If this is the broad ground upon which you go, do you convict him upon the evidence of two witne&s;&s;es, to the &s;ame overt act, tran&s;acted at the &s;ame place? No, you do it upon the evidence of two, and a number of other evidence be&s;ides, on a variety of circum&s;tances. Let me &s;up|po&s;e for a moment, that two witne&s;&s;es had come forward, and given an account of his conduct at Bethlehem, but that evidence was not &s;ufficient to an&s;wer the indictment: you hear of &s;uch and &s;uch con|duct at Quaker town, at Kline's, &amp;c. &amp;c. I a&s;k, would he have been convicted upon the evidence of tho&s;e two independent of any other? No, he would not. This is by no means agreeable to the &s;tatutes of William III, or Edward VI, and in my view totally inad|mi&s;&s;ible. What is the con&s;equence of &s;uch a verdict? Why, a man charged with murder, a&s;&s;ault or what not, may know who the wit|ne&s;&s;es again&s;t him are, while one charged with trea&s;on, the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible crime, may not know, if you can travel from town to town, and from county to county for the evidence; if you can bring cor|re&s;pondence, &amp;c. from every part, of which the pri&s;oner knew nothing until brought before the court. No man would be &s;afe in the ad|mi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch things, but you mu&s;t form your opinion alone from the evidence of two witne&s;&s;es relating to the act committed at Bethlehem agreeable to the indictment. The &s;tatutes, and our act of Congre&s;s mean and intend to prevent this kind of rambling over the whole &s;tate for evidence, or indeed upon the doctrine of the gentleman, not|with&s;tanding the act &s;ays otherwi&s;e, they can with equal propriety go throughout the United States to collect evidence to &s;upport the pro|&s;ecution, which was never &s;een nor heard of before.</P>
<P>I now contend, gentlemen, that the ca&s;e of the pri&s;oner at the bar does not come within the &s;tatute of trea&s;on; and I al&s;o contend that it does come within one of two other acts, for the judiciary act 22 and 23 &s;ections, page 109, vol. 1. &s;peaking of re&s;i&s;tance of proce&s;s and re&s;cue, compleatly extends to the pri&s;oner. No, &s;ay the gentlemen, it is not a mere re&s;cue, but a re&s;cue for certain intentions and de&s;igns. Have the Congre&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed any particular de&s;ign, or have they not in this law? No they have not: then permit me to &s;ay where Congre&s;s have not di&s;tingui&s;hed it, nor the books, it is not for judges nor juries to di&s;tingui&s;h: it belonged to Congre&s;s to make or except &s;uch ca&s;es as they thought proper, they have not thought proper; and you have no right whatever to do it.</P>

But le&s;t my objection &s;hould appear of weight to except it from the judiciary act, there is a very good law, but which has been &s;hamefully villified and abu&s;ed, called the &s;edition bill, providing fine and impri&s;onment for any high mi&s;demeanor, under which, us I ob|&s;erved before, the very actions of the pri&s;oner are defined. This act has pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the trials of the we&s;tern in&s;urgents in 1794, &s;o that the opinions of the judges re&s;pecting trea&s;on at that time, is mo&s;t clearly and fairly &s;uperceded by this act, which has pointed out, whatever has heretofore cau&s;ed doubts about the meaning of trea&s;on in the &s;tatute, and thus put an end to any judicial con&s;truction. That act provides, that if any per&s;ons &s;hould combine or con&s;pire together, to impede the operation of any law of the United States, or to intimidate any per|&s;ons holding places or offices under the United States&mdash;This la&s;t, is one of the many little things collected together, in order, that when brought into a ma&s;s, they may amount to trea&s;on&mdash;It goes on, that if they &s;hould advi&s;e, attempt, or procure any in&s;urrection, riot, or unlawful a&s;&s;embly or combination, he or they &s;hall be deemed guilty of an <HI>high misdemeanor.</HI> The very crimes which are here enumerated are charged upon John Fries, the pri&s;oner at the bar: <HI>whether it is carried into effect or not.</HI> Now, if any act or de&s;cription can be more ju&s;t than this, I &s;hould wonder; it an&s;wers preci&s;ely every part of the crime charged, and every concomitant circum&s;tance. Now the que&s;|tion is, whether or not, as the con&s;titution did not define the puni&s;h|ment of trea&s;on, and as a mi&s;demeanor is de&s;cribed here, to be what &s;ome have thought u&s;ed to be levying war, and as the puni&s;hment is le&s;s, than what the other law re&s;pecting trea&s;on enacts; whether this &s;hould not operate as a repeal of the former law, &s;o far as related to the&s;e points. As to the ca&s;es of Vigal and Mitchel, we&s;tern in&s;ur|gents, I &s;hould doubt whether it would affect them at all, even if the law had then exi&s;ted, becau&s;e the circum&s;tances very much differed from the in&s;urrection in Northampton county. Wells and Nevil were in&s;pectors, and their offices were &s;trictly belonging to the United States, and were depo&s;its of the United States, and equally under the protection of the law, with ca&s;tles or citadels: in addition to this, the officers of government were driven from their own homes, and upon pain of death, they dared not approach their homes. Their offices were burnt by the in&s;urgents, and there was no law that touched their ca&s;e but the con&s;titutional act defining trea&s;on; on which account, they were tried and convicted under it. I would introduce the&s;e ideas, to &s;how you, that the deci&s;ions then formed by the court, are inapplicable at this time, &s;ince the Sedition act is &s;ince pa&s;&s;ed, and agreeable to the&s;e circum&s;tances, which materially differ from tho&s;e of 1794.</P>
<P>It is now time to clo&s;e. Gentlemen, the ta&s;k which you have to perform is very &s;erious, and very important; but I will not in&s;ult your under|&s;tandings, by &s;aying more than my indi&s;pen&s;ible duty claims from me, in behalf of the pri&s;oner. You will, I have no doubt, con&s;ider the ca&s;e calmly, wi&s;ely, and deliberately. You know the law, under the direction of the court: and I have no doubt, you will decide accord|ing to the impul&s;e of your con&s;ciences. I will only add, that the pri&s;oner received, and has held his life from the authority of Him, who is all-wi&s;e great and good, and by Him only, can it be de&s;troyed, except he has

violated tho&s;e equitable laws made by his country for the pre&s;ervation of peace and order in &s;ociety: he is therefore entitled to an equitable verdict: if he has done the acts named in the indictment, I have no doubt, you will pronounce him guilty: if he has forfeited his life, go he mu&s;t, and if he is to go, it is not in the power of men to prevent it. I &s;hall therefore re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that you will give a con&s;cientious verdict, upon which you are bound to an&s;wer.</P>

<P>AFTER his exordium, in which he expre&s;&s;ed the importance of his &s;ituation as public accu&s;er&mdash;he hoped that while his duty peremptorily impo&s;ed upon him, the nece&s;&s;ity of doing ju&s;tice to the United States, he &s;hould not be dive&s;ted of candour towards the unfortunate pri&s;oner at the bar, to whom he hoped full ju&s;tice would be done. He propo&s;ed in the fir&s;t place to collect the detail of tran&s;actions, the clear and unequivocal train they had been te&s;tified by the &s;everal witne&s;&s;es, not only called to &s;upport the pro&s;ecution, but unhappily for the pri&s;oner, corroborated by the witne&s;&s;es called by him&s;elf. In the &s;econd place he &s;hould apply the&s;e facts to the laws and Con&s;titution of the United States: from both of which he thought it would evident|ly appear to the jury that the pri&s;oner was guilty of trea&s;on in levy|ing war again&s;t the United States.</P>
<P>The pri&s;oner &s;tood indicated for oppo&s;ing in a warlike manner, two laws of the United States, the one entitled "an act providing for the valuation of lands and dwelling hou&s;es," &amp;c. pa&s;&s;ed July 9, 1798, and the other entitled an act for levying a direct tax within the United States, pa&s;&s;ed July 14, 1798. agreeable to the&s;e acts certain commi&s;|&s;ions and a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors were to be appointed to carry the provi&s;ions thereof into execution. It appeared in evidence that Mr. Eyerly, one of the witne&s;&s;es produced, had received a commi&s;&s;ion conformable thereto in a part of Penn&s;ylvania, which he received in Augu&s;t, 1798, together with a reque&s;t from the &s;ecretary of the trea&s;ury, that he would find &s;uitable characters to &s;erve as a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors to act in the divi&s;ion a&s;&s;igned to him. In the execution of this reque&s;t Mr. Eyerly found very great difficulties, although there was a perfect acquie&s;cence in all other parts of the union. Many whom he nominated declined on account of the unpopularity of tho&s;e laws, although Mr. Eyerly very indu&s;triou&s;ly, and in a prai&s;e worthy manner endeavored to remove tho&s;e objec|tions.</P>
<P>In order to &s;how the general difficulties there was in the execu|tion of the&s;e officers' duty. Mr. Attorney recited the te&s;timony of Mr. Eyerly (page 47) and its confirmation by Mr. Chapman, Mr. Henry and others. He al&s;o went into an examination of the te&s;ti|mony demon&s;trative of the difficulties the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors found in the execu|tion of their duty and the in&s;ult they frequently meet with, when en|gaged in their pacific efforts to explain the law to the mi&s;led rabble<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

But &s;orry was he to &s;ay, that the&s;e commendable efforts were out|weighed by the influence of certain leaders, among whom he found &s;everal captains of militia, and Fries with the re&s;t: he throughout the whole &s;cene appeared the mo&s;t prominent, and in&s;tead of attend|ing to the good advices given him by his be&s;t friends, flew in a rage and renewed his oppo&s;ition. A part of the effects of their ho&s;tility was accompli&s;hed in preventing Mr. Clark from fulfilling the office which he had undertaken, and the general reluctance there was in others, and indeed finally the abandonment of the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments; for it appeared that, not only tho&s;e who were unwilling to give their rates, refu&s;ed, but tho&s;e who were willing, were intimidated from do|ing it. To &s;uch a pitch was intimidation and di&s;&s;affection arrived, that he was &s;orry to &s;ay, the very <HI>Magistrates</HI> of the peace had &s;o far ne|glected their duty as to join the oppo&s;ition, and nearly all of them, from one or other of the&s;e motives, refu&s;ed to i&s;&s;ue proce&s;s for the apprehen&s;ion of delinquents, or examine per&s;ons who oppo&s;ed the laws: and tho&s;e who did attend to their duty, found the greate&s;t dif|ficulties to procure the attendance of evidences, who were prevented by the impul&s;e of fear from coming forward. Many attempts were made to pacify the&s;e deluded people, who were under the mo&s;t baneful advice, and the attempts accordingly mi&s;carried, even though propo|&s;itions were made in &s;ome town&s;hips to indulge them with the choice of their own a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>Their town meetings were &s;ometimes attended by military bodies, in all the parade of war, with arms, mu&s;ic, and colours flying, who con&s;tantly employed the mo&s;t violent and indecent menace towards the officers of the United States, which made even their per&s;onal &s;afety doubtful. In this &s;tate of things, the mar&s;hal of the di&s;trict was di&s;|patched to &s;erve proce&s;s on a number of the violaters of the public peace, and having &s;erved &s;everal warrants in Lehi town&s;hip, he went to Lower Milford, and thence to Millar's town, where the gentlemen who were with him, a&s;&s;i&s;ting in the duty, met with repeated in&s;ults and even per&s;onal abu&s;e. The a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors were &s;till unable to proceed in mea&s;uring the hou&s;es, and finally obliged to abandon the bu&s;ine&s;s altogether; &s;ome of them having been compelled to re&s;ign on account of the oppo&s;ition they met with, and the threats which were thrown out, &s;o that they were in actual danger of their lives if they had pro|ceeded. While the&s;e officers were going the tour of their duty, in defiance of oppo&s;ition, the principal leader, and indeed principal mover of the in&s;urrection, John Fries, makes a di&s;tingui&s;hed figure upon the &s;tage: he was not yet appri&s;ed that they had proceeded to a&s;&s;e&s;s the hou&s;es in his town&s;hip, as &s;oon as he learnt that they had, deaf to the arguments and rea&s;oning of Mr. James Chapman, he flies into a rage, and exclaims, pointing to a man near him, <Q>If I were to &s;end that man to my hou&s;e to inform them that the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments were going forward, I &s;hould have 700 men here by day light to-morrow, and not only that, but we have men in Montgomery, and all Northamp|ton county to join us.</Q> This, gentlemen, certainly evinces a gene|ral oppo&s;ition to the law, as clearly as words can do it. When told that the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments were going on, it operated on him like an electric

&s;hock, and he &s;ullenly retired having fir&s;t adverted, with threats, to the melancholly &s;cenes which has tran&s;pired in France. He after|wards meets the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors at Jacob Fries's, to &s;ome of whom he expre&s;&s;es much re&s;pect, but certainly not very much like a friend or a neigh|bor, if we con&s;ider the anger which he di&s;played. No; it was not friendly admonition, it was the mark of enmity in di&s;gui&s;e, and the &s;pecial declaration of war: this will be evinced in ob&s;erving the affair near the hou&s;e of Singma&s;ter: (p. 71.) Fries, with &s;ome attendants, met three of the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, one of whom (Mr. Rodrick) they endea|vored to &s;eize. Fries was at the head of the band, but mi&s;&s;ing his mark, and taking Foulke he let him go, with a threat that they &s;hould all be taken the next day: on the next day, when the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors were to meet at Mr. Chapman's, Fries, and his party, met at Jacob Fries's, whence they march in military pomp to Quaker town to exe|cute their threat. They ride up to the tavern, and there, after di&s;|charging their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ieces, give an huzza to the much profaned name of <HI>Liberty.</HI> When the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors came into the town, &s;wolled with large drafts of guilt and whi&s;key, the latter of which it appears that Fries kept clear of, but of the former he had a large portion. Seeing Mr. Rodrick ride through the town, they ordered him to &s;top, which he refu&s;ing, the cry of <HI>fire</HI> was given. Mr. Rodrick did not know who it was gave the word, but they levelled at him. However, gentle|men, on the other &s;ide &s;ay, <HI>they did not fire.</HI> This is the kind of defence which is held up to you: if they had fired, perhaps it would have been &s;aid, they did not hit; if they had hit, that they did not kill, and if they had killed, then it would have been only homicide! Mr. Foulke next came, he was &s;topped by a number, and among them Fries appears. So far as relates to the pri&s;oner at the bar, it appears to have been his &s;tudied object to ab&s;tain from actual violence and outrage at all times; but his plans are regularly accompli&s;hed, not|with&s;tanding his &s;eeming moderation; and from his attention towards Mr. Foulke, and &s;ome others, it was clearly proved that the <HI>officer,</HI> and not the <HI>man,</HI> was obnoxious. Fries had told Mr. Foulke the preceding evening that he would come to his hou&s;e, and bring &s;e|ven hundred men with him, rather than that the law &s;hould be exe|cuted.</P>
<P>The oppo&s;ition to the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, the general tran&s;actions of the 6th of March, and the re&s;olution they entered into to go and liberate the pri&s;oners the next day, Mr. Rawle &s;aid he con&s;idered as the beginning of the trea&s;on. On this day, (March 6th) the pri&s;oner at the bar, the cool, deliberate leader and advi&s;er of this a&s;&s;embly, who&s;e minds and mea&s;ures were tho&s;e of their leader, in which he exhibited his power, particularly on the arrival of Mr Foulke, commanding him to get off his hor&s;e, and come into the hou&s;e, when he demanded his papers; but, on that gentleman making &s;ome demur, he broke out, ordering him not to he&s;itate, on which they are delivered up, and then it, was he made u&s;e of the declaration, that they would not &s;ubmit to the law, till <HI>the other states</HI> had &s;ubmitted. <Q>The law &s;hall be re|pealed; we will not &s;ubmit,</Q> he &s;aid: this we have from a re&s;pect|able witne&s;s. When the papers were returned, it was with a &s;trict

injunction not to proceed in the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments, accompanied with a bra|vado: "You may return me if you think proper." Having done this, there was another a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or who was to be al&s;o brought, and mal|treated (Mr. Childs.) Fries goes to a neighboring hou&s;e, and ac|co&s;ts him in a friendly manner, telling him he mu&s;t go and <HI>see</HI> his men. When arrived, he leaves him among&s;t his men. It is un|nece&s;&s;ary here to recapitulate the orgies of that tran&s;action, in which the venerable name of Wa&s;hington was u&s;ed by their profane lips: they even extend their madne&s;s &s;o far as to call upon Mr. Childs to &s;wear allegiance to them. Suffice it to &s;ay, that the whole period of his &s;tay was filled with hu&s;tling and abu&s;e; but being a robu&s;t man he was not hurt. When Fries returned they were quiet, and he ex|pre&s;&s;ed concern at the treatment, and inquired for the man who did it, but &s;oon he makes a demand of the papers, which being given, he went out exulting at the acqui&s;ition; mean while Mr. Childs was again ill u&s;ed, and which again cea&s;ed on the return of Fries, who being di&s;|appointed in their contents returns the papers. Mr. Childs, in this &s;ituation, does what any man would do, promi&s;es not to go into the town&s;hip again to a&s;&s;e&s;s, and the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments were perfectly &s;topped in Lower Millford. If this had been a mere local matter; if no pro|mi&s;e of a&s;&s;i&s;tance had been received, if no preconcerted, but unexe|cuted plan had not been de&s;igned, their labors might have re&s;ted here, having accompli&s;hed their profe&s;&s;ed purpo&s;e of effectually pre|venting the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments going forward among&s;t them; but their views were more ho&s;tile to the government, under which they were protect|ed, and which was that moment extending its wings to &s;hield them from a&s;&s;ault, in common with their fellow-citizens. Their triumph was incomplete; "nothing was done, while aught remained to do" was their language; for, upon returning to the hou&s;e of Jacob Fries, a me&s;&s;age was &s;ent by Dillinger, at a late hour, to give more general notice that next morning they were to go to Bethlehem in order to re&s;cue the pri&s;oners. Shankweiler and others were named as the pri|&s;oners whom they were to re&s;cue. This, gentlemen, is an important proof of the &s;y&s;tem with which this re&s;cue was conducted, in which it is clear the people of Northampton and Bucks were connected: tho&s;e people of Bucks were informed that certain per&s;ons of North|ampton had been arre&s;ted by a Judges' warrant, and were to be taken down to Philadelphia; but, they rea&s;oned to them&s;elves, <Q>If this is permitted, our plan will fall through; our intimidation of the a&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors will be at an end; they will proceed in their bu&s;ine&s;s, and we &s;hall not be able to carry our plan of defeating the law; we our&s;elves &s;hall be taken next. No; Shankweiler, and all the others, mu&s;t be liberated.</Q> The me&s;&s;age is communicated; and with a view of holding to this &s;teady purpo&s;e, all who were pre&s;ent, the pri|&s;oner at the bar drew up a writing, binding tho&s;e who &s;ub&s;cribed it to meet at Millar's town the next morning: What are the particulars of that in&s;trument we are ignorant, it not having been produced to us; but, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, upon his own declaration, that he never &s;igned it: in this he appears to de&s;ert his comrades, and leave them in a predicament into which he had led them; for, having gone &s;o far,
<PB N="155" REF="037104_0159_100D7E46F5B4DB08">
they would not think of abandoning their plants. The next morning they met by appointment; their proceeding would then have been &s;top|ped by intelligence given them by young Marks, but on con&s;ultation, the pri&s;oner at the bar &s;ays, "No, we will proceed as we come &s;o far." They proceeded until they came to the bridge.</P>
<P>During this period the Mar&s;hal, who had been di&s;patched up to &s;erve warrants from the judge of the di&s;trict, arrived, and after a variety of in&s;tances of oppo&s;ition, as related by him&s;elf (p. 37) by Mr. Henry (p. 24) and by Mr. Eyerly (p. 45.) He was going forward in the execution of his duty as well as he was able, but being informed of the de&s;ign which was formed to re&s;cue the pri&s;oners who had promi&s;ed to meet him at Bethlehem, by virtue of the powers deputed to a She|riff, he procures a <HI>Posse Commitatus</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, on which account, ow|ing to the generally di&s;&s;atisfied &s;tate of the neighborhood, he was for|ced to &s;end &s;o far as Ea&s;ton for &s;ome of tho&s;e aids. The next day the Mar&s;hal was ready to receive his pri&s;oners: two men armed then made their appearance.</P>
<P>Mr. Rawle here retorted pretty &s;trongly on Mr. Lewis's reference to 2 Lord Raymond 1301. adverting to the <HI>false imprisonment</HI> (as that gentleman called it) of Keifer and Paulus at Bethlehem, previous to the commencement of the general outrage, in which he recited the evidence re&s;pecting the arrival of tho&s;e two men, and ju&s;tified the Mar|&s;hal for his prudent precaution to prevent the &s;hedding of blood, be|cau&s;e, from his information, he appeared to be in a delicate and dan|gerous &s;ituation. I would rather, Mr. Rawle exclaimed, &s;pend my life in voluntary exile on the bleak &s;hores of Botany Bay, than live at large in a country where a Mar&s;hal in the execution of &s;uch an in|valuable duty, &s;hould be held up as an object of guilt: this is at once de&s;troying all that we hold dear&mdash;our judicial &s;y&s;tem, on which depends our &s;ecurity. The act was laudable, becau&s;e it was an act of per&s;onal &s;afety and general prudence.</P>
<P>Mr. Rawle then proceeded to examine the evidence until the arrival of Fries at Bethlehem, contending that neither the arre&s;t of tho&s;e two men, nor that of Shankweiler particularly, who had never &s;urrendered him&s;elf pri&s;oner at all, was the cau&s;e of the a&s;&s;embling Fries and the party at Miller's town, their march from Milford, or their arrival at the bridge near Bethlehem: it was not till after their arrival at the bridge that the party were informed of the detention of the&s;e two men, when they &s;ent to demand them. They were liberated, but in order to beg this <HI>armed force</HI> to come no farther, the Mar&s;hal di&s;patches four of his <HI>posse</HI> to rea&s;on with them. But the object was not yet attain|ed, for while the&s;e two men were delivering up, the Mar&s;hal perceives the pri&s;oner at the head of his party, with a &s;word drawn, marching up with all the appurtenances of war, although the others had enga|ged to await an an&s;wer at the bridge. They appeared to be in&s;tigated to pa&s;s the bridge by the arrival and example of Fries, and from that moment affairs a&s;&s;umed the awful &s;pectacle which the Mar&s;hal had been Previou&s;ly led to apprehend, and this John Fries who had obtained the rank of a Captain in the Militia, which he ought to have u&s;ed &s;olely to defend his country, pro&s;titutes his command to the ba&s;e and dan|gerous
<PB N="156" REF="037104_0160_100D7E49647D3F60">
purpo&s;e of rebellion again&s;t the government. All the evidence agree that the only leader; the only di&s;tingui&s;hed character; the on|ly amba&s;&s;ador, negociator, and advi&s;er that appeared throughout the whole tran&s;action was the pri&s;oner at the bar: It is he that goes fir&s;t to demand the pri&s;oners: a recital of his conduct may be &s;een in Tho|mas's and Mitchel's te&s;timony, corroborated by others. He declares, <Q>Gentlemen, if you are willing <HI>we will</HI> take them, I will go fore|mo&s;t; none of you fire till they fire on us fir&s;t; till I give the word; if I drop, then take your own command.</Q> To give him all the cre|dit due to his humanity it is ob&s;ervable that he wi&s;hed to obtain his ob|ject by intimidation, but if it was not attainable by threats, force mu&s;t be re&s;orted to. No doubt there mu&s;t have been a moment when he at|tended to per&s;onal &s;afety; as commander, and foremo&s;t man in a nar|row pa&s;&s;age, he mu&s;t have fallen fir&s;t, he had a very fair chance of re|ceiving a blow or a bullet, and therefore that precaution for his men not to fire became indi&s;pen&s;ible. The object of the&s;e in&s;urgents was not to commit murder, the pri&s;oner is not charged with it, but to pre|vent the execution of the law, and this was to be obtained better without a lo&s;s of life than with it, but the expre&s;&s;ions of Wm. Barnet, reciting tho&s;e of the pri&s;oner, were "Stick, Stab, and do as good as you can, as I expect fir&s;t to get it."</P>
<P>Gentlemen, Trea&s;on may &s;ometimes, and indeed often does call in|to its aid the commi&s;&s;ion of acts horrid and atrocious, but &s;uch atro|cities are not nece&s;&s;arily component parts of Trea&s;on. Actual homi|cide, de&s;truction, or &s;eizure of property may, and often does occur: if the Mar&s;hal on that unhappy occa&s;ion had &s;tood out five minutes long|er, I leave it to your&s;elves, or to any di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate per&s;on to judge whether <HI>lives</HI>&mdash;more than the life of the pri&s;oner would not have been lo&s;t, and &s;till the crime would have been but <HI>Treason;</HI> But that it did not arrive to &s;uch an horrid &s;cene we are indebted to the judicious con|duct of the Mar&s;hal, who acted <HI>above all praise:</HI> influenced by the advice of two of the neighboring magi&s;trates, who&s;e powers were in|&s;ulted and &s;u&s;pended, and who mu&s;t, with him&s;elf, have fallen a &s;acri|fice in the execution of their duty, he determines to make the &s;urren|der: <Q>the re&s;cue, &s;aid Mr. Horsfield, I con&s;idered was perfect, other|wi&s;e the de&s;truction of human lives was certain: you are a &s;tiff Of|ficer. (to the Mar&s;hal) When I &s;ee tho&s;e guns levelled at the win|dow: when I hear tho&s;e &s;avage &s;hricks, I now think you will be ju&s;|tifiable in giving up the pri&s;oners.</Q> The Mar&s;hal, after much he&s;i|tation, acted very laudably in giving them up without farther oppo&s;i|tion. I grant that Mr. Eyerly and Mr. Balliot retired unhurt, but ob&s;erve, gentlemen, they were not the object; the liberation of the pri&s;oners, and thus preventing the Mar&s;hal executing proce&s;s, was their only aim, and when they obtained that, they de&s;i&s;ted from farther vi|olence.</P>
<P>I might with propriety apply to this Trea&s;on words which were u&s;ed for a different purpo&s;e by Pope,</P>
<P>"All are but parts of one &s;tupendous whole:"</P>
<P>A general plan of oppo&s;ition to the law was contemplated, and the relea&s;e of the pri&s;oners was but one of the parts, if not of <Q>one &s;tupen|dous
<PB N="157" REF="037104_0161_100D7E4B6AEB4E00">
whole,</Q> it was of one <HI>great system.</HI> Having obtained their ob|ject, they retired from their &s;ucce&s;sful expedition, the trumpeter &s;ound|ing the triumphal bla&s;t before the conquerors, in defiance of the legal authority of the United States, and thus departed, we hear no more of them.</P>
<P>The&s;e are facts;&mdash;not founded on the te&s;timony of a &s;ingle witne&s;s, which is &s;ufficient to convict a man in common ca&s;es; nor are they confined to the te&s;timony of two witne&s;&s;es, which is all the con&s;titution requires; but they are corroborated by numerous witne&s;&s;es, produced in order to remove every doubt from your minds as to the material facts of the crime. There is no ca&s;e in our books more clear than the pre&s;ent, the evidence is &s;o uniform, that even the ingenuity and talents of the pri&s;oner's coun&s;el have not been able to conte&s;t one fact that has been related; indeed the whole is &s;o fair, that the mo&s;t incredulous mu&s;t be &s;atisfied of the accuracy of the charge, independant of the confe&s;&s;ion of the pri&s;oner, which confirms the whole: it proves to a demon&s;tration that his main object was nothing le&s;s than to prevent the execution of the laws which all men are bound to obey.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the coun&s;el for the pri&s;oner have endeavored to di|mini&s;h the force of that voluntary confe&s;&s;ion by telling you that no man can be convicted upon his own confe&s;&s;ion out of Court, nor with|out the te&s;timony of two witne&s;&s;es: the &s;ame arguments have been u&s;ed to nullify the expre&s;&s;ions which we have produced proof that the pri|&s;oner frequently made u&s;e of, from which we evidently di&s;cover his inten|tion. I allow that no man &s;hould be convicted for trea&s;on unle&s;s upon the te&s;timony of two witne&s;&s;es, or confe&s;&s;ion in open Court; but when all the facts nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ub&s;tantiate the crime proved by two witne&s;&s;es, the declarations of the pri&s;oner, as well as his confe&s;&s;ion may be produced as good evidence as to his intention, and this is not nece&s;&s;ary to be proved by two witne&s;&s;es; this tends to &s;how the de&s;igns of his heart, which can only be known to his Creator and him&s;elf. The&s;e declara|tions &s;hould be known to the Court, in order to di&s;cover the intention with which the crime was perpetrated. In the ca&s;e of Lord Gordon, the words &s;aid to have been u&s;ed by him in the lobby of the hou&s;e was not rejected by the jury becau&s;e it required two witne&s;&s;es, but on account of the improbability of a declaration having been publicly u&s;ed which no more than one individual could be produced to prove. We have proved by two witne&s;&s;es that the overt act was committed by the pri&s;oner, and have produced much corroborative te&s;timony, in which we have not been confined to two, having heard it from twelve re&s;pectable witne&s;&s;es. If we have &s;ucceeded to prove the intention, it is &s;ufficient for the law, and if you believe the te&s;timony, it indubita|bly &s;ub&s;tantiates the fact.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr. Rawle, in the examination of the testimony, went more at length than we have thought it necessary to follow him, because no refer|ence can be made to it.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to con&s;ider what is the law ari&s;ing upon the&s;e facts, in going into the examination of which, I &s;hall put out of the
<PB N="158" REF="037104_0162_100D7E51846123B8">
que&s;tion two objections, one of them only has been produced, the other having barely been alluded to, rather than held up.</P>
<P>A proclamation was i&s;&s;ued by the Pre&s;ident, on which Fries did then go to his home, whereupon it has been argued that no in&s;tance can be produced to prove a pro&s;ecution being commenced for acts committed prior to the reading of the riot act in England, if the mob thereupon di&s;per&s;ed, becau&s;e they had complied with the proclamati|on. It is right in part: if the people do not di&s;per&s;e, the remaining mob are guilty of felony: but I a&s;k the gentlemen has the defence been at all &s;et up on the ground of compliance with the proclamation? In the riot at Drury Lane theatre by the footmen; and that which was held up in which the earl of E&s;&s;ex and others were engaged, ma|ny of the rioters did di&s;per&s;e in con&s;equence of the riot act being read, and yet were afterward puni&s;hed for the enormities they committed while they were there. Alike trivial is the objection re&s;pecting the undue appointment of a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. It is &s;ufficient that &s;uch a per&s;on acts as commi&s;&s;ioner or a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, if he u&s;urps that power the law has provi|ded a remedy by other means than the dangerous one of an in&s;urrecti|on to know merely whether&punc; A. B. or C. are regularly appointed to office. There are legal modes of application to a&s;certain the fact; there is the whole board of commi&s;&s;ioners, or even an higher power may be applied to, to a&s;certain the authority, and no virtuous hone&s;t citizen would think of oppo&s;ition on that account. We do not think it nece&s;&s;ary to trouble the court, &s;ince it was fully in the power of the pri&s;oner's council to have brought the commi&s;&s;ioners under this act before them, but not having availed them&s;elves of it, nor pre&s;&s;ed it home to your notice, gentlemen, why was &s;uch a &s;care-crow in&s;inu|ated, but to mi&s;lead you? there can be no doubt of the legality of tho&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners, if there was, it would not alleviate the crime of rebellion. But that was never u&s;ed, neither by the pri&s;oner him&s;elf, nor any of the in&s;urgents, as a ground for the rebellion; it was not even a colouring for it, nor does it appear that the in&s;urgents ever doubted in the &s;malle&s;t degree, the legality of the appointments, their declarations were repeatedly "no a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors &s;hall act in the town&s;hip, nor &s;hall any a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments be made." No doubt was ever made of the pow|ers u&s;ed by the officers, and therefore the oppo&s;ition to the law is alone to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P>Having di&s;po&s;ed of tho&s;e two points, I wi&s;h now to impre&s;s upon your minds a mo&s;t &s;olemn conviction, to wit, That the law under which the pri&s;oner at the bar &s;tands indicted, without being in the lea&s;t doubtful, ambiguous, ob&s;cure, or perplexing, is well defined in, and compo&s;es a part of the Con&s;titution of the United States, art. 3. &s;ect. 3. It is certainly momentous that you &s;hould be fully &s;atisfied of the true meaning of that part under which the pre&s;ent crime is placed, to wit, "levying war again&s;t the United States." I would premi&s;e that the indictment is worded preci&s;ely in the u&s;ual form, and that the only que&s;tion now is, what is that levying war with which the pri|&s;oner is charged?</P>
<P>To a&s;certain what is levying war, it is nece&s;&s;ary for us only to con&s;ider what is the nature of civil and political &s;ociety in the United
<PB N="159" REF="037104_0163_100D7E5307F6FC78">
States. The government is the organ which the people collectively have thought it their duty and intere&s;t to e&s;tabli&s;h for their mutual &s;afety&mdash;their will, publicly expre&s;&s;ed in the laws, is the legitimate will of the majority of the people: all our laws are the acts of this majo|rity, and it is a radical principle, which will not be controverted, that the will of the majority is always binding upon the minority, and &s;hould be acquie&s;ced in quietly by them, whether the admini&s;tration of that government be in the hands of one per&s;on, or of many; tho&s;e, therefore, who do not choo&s;e to continue in that &s;ociety, ought to withdraw quietly from it, rather than di&s;turb the quiet of the whole. Allegiance is a quiet &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and acquie&s;cence to the &s;upreme power&mdash;In monarchical governments it is placed in the king; but the citizens of America know of no allegiance but to the laws, for they alone are the binding principle by which &s;ociety at large is kept in dome&s;tic peace and &s;ecurity. If, therefore, deviating from this allegi|ance to the laws, mea&s;ures are taken to di&s;turb the public peace by a re&s;i&s;tance of the laws, accompanied by force of arms, or by the inti|midation of numbers &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e, and it be applicable on|ly to a grievance of a public or general, and not of a particular or private intere&s;t, &s;uch re&s;i&s;tance then becomes the crime of <HI>treason,</HI> and particularly &s;o if the views are to bring about the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion or repeal of <HI>any</HI> of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ws; for there is no particular kind of law liable to exception; it is trea&s;on, becau&s;e it is an attempt to overturn the fun|damental principles of &s;ociety, by endeavoring to impo&s;e into the &s;y&s;tem the will of a minority, which has no right to be there; it is creating a new agency, a new &s;pecies of legi&s;lature, and eventually di&s;&s;olving the powers legally ordained. This definition may apply as well to any <HI>one</HI> law as to <HI>all</HI> the laws, for each is equally &s;tamped with public approbation, and to none particularly is &s;anctity attached, all proceeding from one power, tho&s;e who undertake to re&s;i&s;t <HI>any</HI> one, may with equal propriety re&s;i&s;t the whole, and trea&s;on appears to me to be the inevitable inference, otherwi&s;e it would be impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain the limits at which this dangerous licentious conduct mu&s;t &s;top, we &s;hould be at once thrown back into a &s;tate of natural &s;ociety; which God prevent. I a&s;k the gentlemen who argued for this di&s;tinction, to point out to me which law may be re&s;i&s;ted with impunity! If one may be, the evil principle will go on to another and another, and where will it &s;top!</P>
<P>I have no occa&s;ion again to recur to the authorities we have produ|ced which the gentlemen pa&s;s over as the acts of bad times, cor|rupt judges, a profligate court, &amp;c. The coun&s;el with all their learning and indu&s;try &s;eem to be &s;atisfied with this general di&s;charge of our au|thorities, but whatever might have been the ba&s;ene&s;s of the attorney generals of tho&s;e times, the meanne&s;s of the judges, the profligacy of the court, or the merits of the pri&s;oner, we &s;tand upon broad e&s;tabli&s;hed, and general ground, which is not pretended to be obligatory upon us merely becau&s;e it has heretofore been decided, nor is it obligatory in England upon that account, although you have been &s;o told, but we go upon it, becau&s;e it is <HI>right.</HI> That Sir Walter Raleigh was gro&s;s|ly abu&s;ed by Sir Edward Coke as notorious; it was the bad practices of

tho&s;e times, but this reference more regards the proceedings on trials, than the deci&s;ions: the deci&s;ions uniformly were, that u&s;urpation of <HI>public</HI> authority in a certain manner, amounted to Trea&s;on. What! &s;hall a man be permitted to attack the government by piecemeal? to take out a plank here and a plank there, till our political &s;hip &s;inks, and &s;uch conduct not be called a trea&s;onable divi&s;ion of the govern|ment! With re&s;pect to the <HI>authorities</HI> wherein it was &s;tated to be nece&s;&s;ary that the de&s;ign &s;hould be to pull down meeting hou&s;es, brothels &amp;c. <HI>generally</HI> in order to con&s;titute high trea&s;on, it mu&s;t be ob&s;ervable that it was the a&s;&s;umption of the <HI>legal powers</HI> which con&s;titu|ted the crime; to pull down meeting hou&s;es as &s;uch, was interfer|ing with the toleration granted by government, and therefore trea&s;on|able. With re&s;pect to Bawdy hou&s;es, government, and not individu|als, have a right to correct them, and if individuals pretended to cor|rect the evil, they were attainted of high trea&s;on.</P>
<P>We are told that no ca&s;e is to be found in which a mere re&s;cue is called trea&s;on. Hale 133, in my opinion is an authority in point. Bethlehem was the pri&s;on of the United States under the mar&s;hal, there the mar&s;hal held &s;everal per&s;ons in cu&s;tody, and levying war, or attempting by force or intimidation to deliver tho&s;e pri&s;oners out of his cu&s;tody is certainly trea&s;on.

But there was no &s;uch thing. A &s;trong and important part of the combination was actually carried into effect, and it was not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to prove the re&s;cue in order to prove the trea&s;on: it has been evidently &s;hown to you in the tran&s;|actions at Quaker town, &s;o that the re&s;cue was only a part, and the termination of the general plan &s;o far as it proceeded.</P>
<P>I have no need to take up more authorities to prove that this is trea|&s;on: it was &s;o before the birth of our con&s;titution: this principle was coeval with the reign of Edward III, in 1340. I take it to be a true and incontrovertible principle, that when we &s;ind an act, on which previous deci&s;ions have been made, tho&s;e deci&s;ions have been acted
<PB N="161" REF="037104_0165_100D7E56B40DF168">
upon, and we &s;hould think proper to pa&s;s that act by engrafting it in|to, and making it a part of our con&s;titution, tho&s;e deci&s;ions are of cour&s;e adopted as our direction, whereby we are to under&s;tand the ap|plications of that act. I would barely ob&s;erve that while tho&s;e gentle men are telling us that we are not to have recour&s;e to tho&s;e volumes of laws, (which we ought all to be acquainted with, as volumes of &s;cience, explanatory of the code by which we are bound) they them|&s;elves re&s;ort to the &s;ame &s;pecies of authority, to endeavor to prove that trea&s;on under the act of Edward III, is not trea&s;on in America. We have heard much about con&s;tructive and interpretative trea&s;on, and con&s;tructive levying of war. Agreeable to the form of government in England, the king is recognized as king in two capacities, one in his natural, as king, and one in his political, as &s;overeign: now, when that part of trea&s;on called compa&s;&s;ing the king's death is mentioned, it refers to his natural capacity, but when of levying war again&s;t the king, it refers to his political capacity, and it was therefore nece&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y to &s;how the di&s;tinction between different &s;pecies of trea&s;on: this latt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> is termed con&s;tructive trea&s;on; but from the variety of its modes of introduction, cannot be &s;o well defined; but its exi&s;tence is nece&s;&s;ary in order to &s;upport &s;ociety and pre&s;erve it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> this is what is termed levying of war; it may con&s;i&s;t in oppo&s;ition <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the king's forces, or by threats or force attempting to compel the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to remove his mini&s;ters, or alter e&s;tabli&s;hed laws.

Gentle|men, the law is e&s;tabli&s;hed, but the argument's vani&s;h like vapour be|fore the morning &s;un; what, then, in England is called con&s;tructive levying of war, in this country mu&s;t be called direct levying of war. The framers of our con&s;titution were as learned, and as wi&s;e as any gentlemen now at the bar; they certainly &s;aw that this was the only kind of direct of levying of war that could exi&s;t in this country, and therefore if they had not intended that what was called con&s;tructive in England &s;hould con&s;titute what they called "levying of war again&s;t the United States," they would not have introduced the crime at all: this is an ab&s;urdity they never would have been guilty of.</P>
<P>The learned gentleman admits that re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t one particular law may be termed con&s;tructive trea&s;on, and may be the crime of trea&s;on here: he &s;ays that re&s;i&s;tance to the militia law would be a re|&s;traint upon the principle dependance of the government, and therefore trea&s;on; gentlemen try our arguments by this te&s;t, and &s;ee whether re|&s;i&s;tance on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion is not equally &s;o. I a&s;k you what is to be|come of the militia, the &s;tanding army, the eventual army, or the civil power it&s;elf, if you are unable to rai&s;e revenue? Who will fight, who will tran&s;|act your civil concerns if they are not paid? If by oppo&s;ing revenue laws the government it&s;elf as well as the army is fundamentally undermined, is it not at lea&s;t as much trea&s;on as though the militia law alone were more openly (but not more effectually) attacked? Nothing is &s;o much enti|tled to re&s;pect and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion as laws which are the direct means of keeping &s;ociety together. At the pre&s;ent time, when the feudal &s;y&s;|tem is no more, but from nece&s;&s;ity &s;ub&s;i&s;tance mu&s;t be obtained from

employment and labor, the defence and pre&s;ervation of the country mu&s;t come from the revenue, and to de&s;troy that is to give a mortal wound to the government it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mr. Rawle then went into a review of &s;ome of the circum&s;tances, alluded to by the oppo&s;ite coun&s;el, which characterize the in&s;urrection, and the trials thereupon in 1795, which he in&s;i&s;ted, though tho&s;e gentlemen would not allow it, were very &s;imilar in circum&s;tances to the unhappy affair now before the court, in which he drew the follow|ing parity between the ca&s;es:</P>
<P>In 1794, the di&s;turbance was to prevent the execution of one law&mdash;the exci&s;e law:</P>
<P>In 1799, the hou&s;e and land-tax laws.</P>
<P>In 1794, four counties were engaged in oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>In 1799, but 3: Northampton, Bucks, and Montgomery.</P>
<P>In 1794, the exci&s;e officers were attacked and prevented executing their duty.</P>
<P>In 1799, the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors were the &s;ame.</P>
<P>In 1794, the in&s;urgents collected into an army, in battle array, di&s;|playing their en&s;igns of triumph, with numbers &s;ufficient to procure their object; &s;ay, 6000 men in Braddock's field.</P>
<P>The object of 1799, was to do it in a &s;imilar manner, and they actually did, by their military appearance and boa&s;ts of much larger increa&s;e, impre&s;s a general opinion of their power, <HI>sufficient</HI> to ac|accompli&s;h their purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>In 1794, the in&s;urgents made public declarations that the exci&s;e law &s;hould never be executed.</P>
<P>In 1799, were not declarations of the &s;ame nature made by the&s;e in&s;urgents; for that other counties, and even other &s;tates would &s;up|port them, and it &s;hould never be done?</P>
<P>The object of 1794, was to obtain a repeal of a law&mdash;the exci&s;e law.</P>
<P>In 1799, it was the &s;ame, &s;o far as related to them&mdash;the hou&s;e and direct tax.</P>
<P>In 1794, the exci&s;e officers were compelled to promi&s;e, that they would not execute the law in that part of the country.</P>
<P>In 1799, the &s;ame promi&s;e is exacted, and obtained re&s;pecting Low|er Milford and other parts. There was &s;ome difference, it is true, as the gentleman &s;tated, &s;ome of the officers at that time being bani&s;hed from their hou&s;es, on pain of death. It was farther argued, that there was this &s;triking di&s;tinction; that General Nevil's hou&s;e might be con&s;idered as a ca&s;tle of the United States, becau&s;e it was an office of exci&s;e; but the analogy &s;till holds good; it was General Nevil's dwelling-hou&s;e, however, that was attacked; the attack was made on|ly becau&s;e he was an officer employed in the &s;uperintendance of a tax they di&s;liked: Mr. Levering's tavern at Bethlehem was made the pri|&s;on of the United States, and there was an executive officer of the United States, it was as much &s;o as any other pri&s;on in the Union: this was the ca&s;tle, the fortre&s;s of the United States, to protect which the mar&s;hal had a&s;&s;embled his <HI>posse commitatus,</HI> provided with weapons
<PB N="163" REF="037104_0167_100D7E5B9171AAF0">
of defence. I con&s;ider this, therefore, a more violent breach of the law than the attack upon General Nevil's hou&s;e; &s;o far as it went&mdash;admitting that no guns were fired, nor lives lo&s;t, nor was any hou&s;e burnt, otherwi&s;e &s;o far as it went the ca&s;e was rather &s;tronger than the former. Happy is it for the pri&s;oners that the &s;cene of riot was not farther from the &s;eat of government: if it had been more remote from the power of government, we cannot calculate upon the con&s;equences, or increa&s;e of revolt and exce&s;s which would have been evinced. I will not pretend to anticipate them, for I wi&s;h not to inflame my own mind by the &s;ad calculation, nor the minds of the jury; I only wi&s;h the facts to appear in their native colours.</P>
<P>Why then can we entertain a doubt, viewing all the&s;e circum|&s;tances, that the pri&s;oner is guilty of trea&s;on? There can be none. We are told that the legi&s;lature have parted a law, entitled the Sedition Act, which &s;hows the offence of the pri&s;oner; and that the opinion of the legi&s;lature was to bring under this law the con&s;titutional definition of trea&s;on, making it a mi&s;demeanor! To me, of all the weak argu|ments which have been brought in behalf of the pri&s;oner, this is the weake&s;t. This law, which has been cried up from one end of the continent to the other by &s;ome per&s;ons as uncon&s;titutional, is now to be brought into court to explain away what the con&s;titution po&s;itively defines to be trea&s;on. If this ever had been the intention of the legi&s;lature, there certainly would have been &s;omething like trea&s;on, &s;omething like levying of war introduced into that bill, but we find no &s;uch thing; the words do not at all occur in it, and that it is not intended, I think is clear. Sedition and trea&s;on are two di&s;tinct crimes, and two di&s;tinct puni&s;hments are enacted to meet them. The de&s;cription of crime in the &s;edition act, is tho&s;e who combine with intent to impede the operation of the law, and tho&s;e who intend to rai&s;e an in&s;urrection&mdash;the&s;e are to be con&s;idered as guilty of an high mi&s;demeanor. Now, tho&s;e who <HI>conspire</HI> to commit trea&s;on are not con&s;idered guilty of trea&s;on; the trea&s;on mu&s;t have been carried into effect. It cannot be trea&s;on for a man to coun&s;el, advi&s;e, or attempt to procure in&s;urrection with intent to impede the operation of any law of the United States; but this is declared to be a mi&s;demeanor, whe|ther executed or not. Be&s;ides, the word <HI>"treasonable,"</HI> is not in&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed in the &s;edition law: thus, if a man be indicted for taking the pro|perty of another, unle&s;s the word <HI>feloniously</HI> is introduced, he is not liable to the charge. So in this ca&s;e, the act mu&s;t be traitorou&s;ly done, or it is not trea&s;on. To &s;how the ab&s;urdity of this doctrine, we need only for a minute &s;uppo&s;e, that in the commi&s;&s;ion of any of the crimes &s;pecified in the &s;edition act, lives &s;hould be lo&s;t, hou&s;es burnt, &amp;c. The laws of the United States have previou&s;ly declared, that &s;uch offenders &s;hould be puni&s;hed with death, and &s;urely it ought to be carried into execution&mdash;not be mitigated by a future law to t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e mere penalty of 5000 dollars, and five years impri&s;onment. If this was the intention of the legi&s;lature, might it not, at lea&s;t, be expected that they would have declared &s;o in the act; but they have manife&s;ted no &s;uch intention, in that, nor in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, with re&s;pect to which, had they done it, they would have overleaped their con&s;titution|al
<PB N="164" REF="037104_0168_100D7E5E994786F0">
powers; for the con&s;titution is an ark, into which the legi&s;lature it&s;elf dare not place its feet; if they were to do it, the judiciary have the power, and it is their duty to bring them back again, and &s;ay, "You have gone too far:" They can as much re&s;train an uncon&s;ti|tutional act, as Congre&s;s can make a con&s;titutional act. This con&s;ti|tution gave Congre&s;s the power to declare the puni&s;hment that &s;hould be inflicted on what it had defined to be trea&s;on. Congre&s;s had no|thing to do with the crime, and if they have declared it, as the gen|tleman &s;uppo&s;es, they have done it without authority, and it can be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> no avail whatever. But no, they have rather, in the act alluded to, declared what &s;hould not be con&s;idered trea&s;on, or removed doubts upon that head. This being the ca&s;e, the &s;ame opinion which operated on the judges in 1795, is &s;till in force; becau&s;e no legi&s;lative act has intervened to change it. Certain it is, that Congre&s;s did not intend to enact an uncon&s;titutional puni&s;hment for trea&s;on; but if they had intended it, they have not a right to do it, nor have they done it.</P>
<P>Now, gentlemen, whether the&s;e things are as we have repre&s;ented, or not, are for you to judge, and decide upon your information, if you are &s;atisfied that the pri&s;oner at the bar was engaged in the affair at Bethlehem, and that affair was connected with other previous ar|rangements, you mu&s;t convict him, otherwi&s;e you mu&s;t not. We con&s;ider, and think the evidence mu&s;t prove to you, that all are parts of the &s;ame whole, were began long before the 7th of March; and that they partly exi&s;ted in Northampton and partly in Bucks counties. It mu&s;t be upon a full conviction in your minds that the trea&s;on was committed by him in Northampton county, that you can convict the pri&s;oner: and if you have not that full conviction, I firmly hope you will acquit him; if you have, you are bound to pronounce him guilty.</P>

<HEAD>CHARGE OF JUDGE IREDELL.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM per&s;uaded that every per&s;on, who has attended to the pre&s;ent very awful and important ca&s;e upon which you are now called to decide, mu&s;t be impre&s;&s;ed with a ju&s;t re&s;pect for the patience and attention you have &s;hown, through the long period which unfortunately has been taken up; but this, though much per&s;onal inconvenience mu&s;t have been experienced, not only by you, but by all concerned, is unavoid|able; none of us can repent that, in a ca&s;e of &s;uch moment as the pre&s;ent, the time which is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for a complete inve&s;ti|gation, has been employed.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, it is with great &s;atisfaction to me, on the pre&s;ent occa|&s;ion, that my ideas on the points of law directing our conclu&s;ions, upon which it is the duty of the court to give opinion, ab&s;olutely

coincides with that of the re&s;pectable judge, with whom I have the honor to &s;it. Before I &s;tate to you any ob&s;ervation, with regard to the facts which have appeared from the evidence, I &s;hall previou&s;ly deliver my opinion upon &s;ome points of law, &s;o far as they are un|connected with the evidences; tho&s;e which are, I &s;hall &s;peak to in their proper place.</P>
<P>This, gentlemen of the jury, is an indictment again&s;t the pri&s;oner at the bar, for levying war again&s;t the United States; the fir&s;t in|quiry therefore is, what is meant by the&s;e words of our con&s;titution. <Q>Trea&s;on again&s;t the United States, &s;hall con&s;i&s;t only in levying war again&s;t them,</Q> &amp;c. The&s;e words are repeated verbatim, I believe, in an act of Congre&s;s, called the Judiciary Act, defining the puni&s;h|ment of the crime of trea&s;on, pur&s;uant to con&s;titutional authority. This crime being defined in the con&s;titution of our country, becomes the &s;upreme law, and can only be altered by the means therein point|ed out, and not by any act of the legi&s;lature; and, therefore, the re|petition of the words of the con&s;titution in the judiciary act is quite unnece&s;&s;ary, as the only power left to Congre&s;s over this crime was, to de&s;cribe the puni&s;hment: the &s;ame act, in another part, makes pro|vi&s;ion for the method of trial. Agreeable to their power, Congre&s;s have de&s;cribed the puni&s;hment, and thereby declared the crime to be capital. It is clear therefore, that, as the con&s;titution has defined the crime, the Congre&s;s, drawing its &s;ole authority from that con&s;titution, cannot change it in any manner, particularly as it is &s;o declared; yet the coun&s;el for the pri&s;oner &s;ay, that the legi&s;lature have given it a legi&s;lative interpretation, and that their interpretation is binding on this court. They &s;ay that Congre&s;s did not mean to include the offence charged upon the pri&s;oner at the bar, under the definition of levying war; becau&s;e the &s;edition aft de&s;cribes a &s;imilar offence, and becau&s;e a re&s;cue is provided for in another act, the puni&s;hment extend|ing no farther than fine and impri&s;onment. Several an&s;wers may be given to remove the&s;e objections:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, If Congre&s;s had intended to interpret the&s;e words of the con|&s;titution, by any &s;ub&s;equent act, they had no kind of authority &s;o to do. The whole judicial power of the government is ve&s;ted in the judges of the United States, in the manner the con&s;titution de&s;cribes; to them alone it belongs to explain the law and con&s;titution; and Congre&s;s have no more right nor authority over the judicial expo&s;itions of tho&s;e acts, than this court has to make a law to bind them. If this was not an article of the con&s;titution, but a mere act of Congre&s;s, they could not interpret the meaning of that act while it was in force, but they may alter, amend, or introduce explanatory &s;ections to it. In this we differ from the practice of England, from whence we re|ceived our juri&s;prudential &s;y&s;tem in general; for they having no con|&s;titution to bind them, the parliament have an unlimited power to pa&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> any act of whatever nature they plea&s;e; and they, con&s;equently, can|not infringe upon the con&s;titution. The very trea&s;on &s;tatute of Ed|ward, III. it&s;elf, contains a provi&s;ion giving parliament an authority to enact laws thereupon, in the&s;e words: <Q>Becau&s;e other like ca&s;es of trea&s;on may happen in time to come, which cannot be thought
<PB N="166" REF="037104_0170_100D7E622FB78F98">
or declared at pre&s;ent: it is thought, that if any &s;uch does happen, <HI>the judges should not try them without first going to the king and par|liament, where it ought to be judged treason, or otherwise felony.</HI></Q> On this point Sir Matthew Hale was very careful, le&s;t con&s;tructive trea&s;on &s;hould be introduced.</P>
<P>This, gentlemen, you will ob&s;erve, only relates to any ca&s;e not &s;pecified in that act. But, on the occa&s;ion now before you, it is not attempted, by any con&s;truction or interpretation, that any thing &s;hould be denominated trea&s;on, that is not preci&s;ely and plainly within the con&s;titution. No trea&s;on can be committed except war has actually been levyed again&s;t the United States.</P>
<P>But farther, nothing is more clear to me than that Congre&s;s did not intend in any manner whatever, to innovate on the con&s;titutional definition of trea&s;on, becau&s;e they have repeated the words, I think, verbatim in their own act, with regard to the re&s;cue and ob&s;truction of proce&s;s which is mentioned in the act alluded to: it will not be pretended, by any man, that every re&s;cue, or every ob&s;truction of an officer in &s;erving proce&s;s, or even both together, amounts to high trea&s;on, or el&s;e to no crime at all: No; the crimes are differently &s;pe|cified, and re&s;cue or ob&s;truction of proce&s;s may be committed without that high charge. This, I think, was &s;ufficiently explained by the coun&s;el for the United States. Suppo&s;e 1000 men ri&s;e in arms, avowedly to de&s;troy the government, and in the execution of their de|&s;ign commit murder, burn hou&s;es, purloin property, &amp;c. does it make the de&s;ign le&s;s evident, becau&s;e they committed other atrocious crimes in order to obtain their main views? No; it was to de&s;troy the government, and that crime would be charged upon them, being the higher crime, which the concomitant ones only tended to aggravate, as they were committed, not for the purpo&s;e of committing murder, but to intimidate the government, and accelerate their object. With regard to what is &s;tated in the &s;edition act&mdash;<HI>combinations and conspi|racies to raise an insurrection,</HI>&mdash;the&s;e, gentlemen, may be committed without the parties being guilty of trea&s;on: men may combine and con&s;pire for a private purpo&s;e; po&s;&s;ibly to injure an individual, mere|ly to gratify &s;ome private motive: if &s;o, they come within that act, and that only. It is only when they carry their projects farther; when they aim at the de&s;truction of the government, that the nature of the offence attains the a&s;pect of, and e&s;&s;entially becomes <HI>treason;</HI> and therefore it is nece&s;&s;ary to prove the <HI>intention,</HI> otherwi&s;e there can be no trea&s;on. There can be no levying war without a number of per&s;ons unite, and that number cannot levy war without &s;ome previous intention; and therefore under this law, there being no previous in|tention defined, but merely an unlawful combination, the act termed <HI>treason</HI> in the con&s;titution, it is plain it is not intended, nor is it of the nature of trea&s;on.</P>
<P>With regard to the authority from which the opinion of this court is founded, and of which you have heard much already, I &s;hall trou|ble you with a very few ob&s;ervations. When this con&s;titution was made, it was in the power of tho&s;e who formed it either to define trea&s;on or not, or, if they thought proper to do &s;o, to do it in what
<PB N="167" REF="037104_0171_100D7E65420597E8">
manner they cho&s;e, in which they might have followed the example of the country whence their ance&s;tors came, to which they were ac|cu&s;tomed, and in which they were mo&s;t experienced in their own &s;e|veral &s;tates, where the crime of levying war was denominated trea|&s;on. I believe this has been generally followed through the &s;tates; in &s;ome I know it has. This term of levying war is an English ex|pre&s;&s;ion, borrowed from the &s;tatute of Edward III; but notwith&s;tand|ing this, the principal provi&s;ions re&s;pecting trea&s;on are taken from an act of the Briti&s;h parliament in the reign of William III, which is principally calculated to guard the independence of the court again&s;t the power of the crown, and the pri&s;oner again&s;t his pro&s;ecutors. Now, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, as the&s;e able and learned framers of our con&s;ti|tution borrowed the act, in terms, from the Briti&s;h &s;tatute alone, an authority with which they were familiar, that they certainly at lea&s;t meant that the Engli&s;h authorities and definition of tho&s;e terms &s;hould be much re&s;pected. Tho&s;e gentlemen knew as well as any coun&s;el at the bar, the danger of con&s;tructive trea&s;ons: they knew how to guard them&s;elves again&s;t the bad times of Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, and were equally acquainted with the better, and more modern deci&s;ions. Would it not have been natural for men &s;o able, &s;o wi&s;e, &s;o cautious of their liberties, had they entertained a doubt of their in&s;ufficiency, to have introduced &s;ome new guards, &s;ome new interpretations, and not to have left us in later times in the dark, expo&s;ed to &s;o much danger as the gentlemen of the bar apprehend? Gentlemen who know any thing of that country, know that arbitrary times have ex|i&s;ted, and al&s;o that a number of deci&s;ions have taken place &s;ince that period. I do not believe that any judge &s;ince the revolution in En|land have ever con&s;idered that he was bound to follow every arbitrary example of the Engli&s;h courts, or the crown laws which had taken place in dark ages. Can any man &s;uppo&s;e that, if a man was to be pro&s;ecuted for either of the crimes referred to by one gentleman (Mr. Lewis) &s;o ab&s;urd a pro&s;ecution would be for a moment indulged by the judges of this age. No, they would highly re&s;ent &s;uch an in|&s;ult offered to an enlightened court. Such in&s;tances have ever been reprobated as much by the courts, as by the gentleman who quoted them.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to this doctrine of precedent, I will take the liberty of &s;ubmitting to you a ca&s;e of a civil nature; &s;uppo&s;e it a ca&s;e of great moment; &s;uppo&s;e in this court, or any other from which an appeal could not be had, a &s;olemn deci&s;ion had been had re&s;pecting a title to a piece of land; upon this adjudication a gentleman wi&s;hes to purcha&s;e this land, taking this title to a lawyer he is confirmed in the opinion that the title is good, and that he is &s;afe <HI>because of the decision of the court.</HI> On the faith of this deci&s;ion alone the man lays his money out, and therefore it mu&s;t be important how precedents are formed. If precedent is &s;o important in a civil ca&s;e, how much more &s;o mu&s;t it be in one like the pre&s;ent. If a ca&s;e is new altogether, and no precedent can be found, it ought to be much in favor of the pri&s;oner, but if a &s;olemn declaration has once been made that &s;uch and &s;uch facts con&s;tituted a certain crime, that declaration ought to
<PB N="168" REF="037104_0172_100D7E66C91C6D90">
be abode by, and for this plain rea&s;on: every man ought lo have an opportunity to know the laws of his country (if he will take pains to inform him&s;elf) le&s;t he &s;hould involve him&s;elf in guilt ignorantly. The propriety and nece&s;&s;ity of this mu&s;t be manife&s;t, and if &s;o, it is as ne|ce&s;&s;ary that the proceedings of our courts &s;hould be uniform, otherwi&s;e their can be no dependance upon their judgment. If, therefore, a point has been &s;ettled in a certain way, it is enough to direct any court to &s;ettle a future ca&s;e of a &s;imilar kind in the &s;ame way, be|cau&s;e nothing can be more unfortunate than when courts of ju&s;tice deviate in deci&s;ions on the &s;ame evidence.</P>
<P>This leads me, gentlemen, to point out to you a con&s;ideration of great magnitude: this is not the fir&s;t time, as I have been informed, that the&s;e que&s;tions have been di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in the court. During the trials of the per&s;ons concerned in the we&s;tern in&s;urrection, they were di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and I have no doubt with great ability on both &s;ides. Judges Patter&s;on and Peters were then on the bench, and after all the di&s;|play of &s;plendid talents u&s;ed in argument on both &s;ides, and all the authorities produced that men were capable of, from the be&s;t judg|ment that could be formed, the court, without he&s;itation, declared it&s;elf in favor of the pro&s;ecution. As I do not differ from that de|ci&s;ion, my opinion is, that the &s;ame declaration ought to be made on the points of law at this time. Vide Dallas's reports 355.</P>
<P>It is, however, objected, that after this &s;olemn deci&s;ion had taken place, the Legi&s;lature, by the &s;edition act, &s;ettled the matter dif|ferently, and that we are bound by that act. This has been an&s;wered, &s;o as to remove it beyond all doubt, and conce&s;&s;ions were made at the bar &s;ufficient to remove the &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of this objection out of the way. It was acknowledged that if it had been an oppo&s;ition to the militia act, then the crime would have been trea&s;on; or if it had been done to compel the repeal of an act, it would have been trea&s;on. For my part, I cannot perceive what kind of &s;anctity there is in the militia act more than any other, that &s;hould make any oppo&s;ition to that act <HI>particularly</HI> &s;erious: all the acts of congre&s;s flow from the &s;ame authority, and all tend to the &s;ame end, to wit, the happine&s;s and &s;ecurity of the community: individuals may differ in their views of the magnitude of them; &s;ome may think the militia law, &s;ome the revenue law, &s;ome another, but the Legi&s;lature have thought all the&s;e laws equally nece&s;&s;ary, and they having thought &s;o, it is our duty to obey them all alike. But, if the oppo&s;ition to the militia law, by force of arms, is to have this extraordinary &s;anctity, becau&s;e it &s;trikes immediately at the exi&s;tence of the government, then I &s;hould be glad to know what can be &s;aid about a revenue law? Go|vernment cannot exi&s;t a day without revenue to &s;upport it! Farther: oppo&s;ition by force to one law, is of the &s;ame nature as oppo&s;ition to all the laws; the offence is levying war again&s;t the government; op|po&s;ing, by force of arms, an act of congre&s;s, with a view of defeat|ing its efficacy, and thus defying the, authority of the government, is equally the &s;ame in principle, if done in one in&s;tance, as it could be in many. In monarchical governments it will &s;ometimes happen that a rebellion breaks out in an endeavor to de&s;troy one monarch, and &s;et
<PB N="169" REF="037104_0173_100D7E6A8BEEB7D0">
another on the throne: in &s;uch a ca&s;e the trea&s;on plainly and unequi|vocally di&s;plays it&s;elf, and there can be no doubt about it; but this cannot occur in a republican form of government: men are &s;eldom found who will be guilty of &s;uch open trea&s;on, as to come forward, in the face of day, and declare their de&s;ign to de&s;troy the <HI>constitution</HI> or <HI>all</HI> the laws. No, if men of &s;en&s;e go to promote in&s;urrection, whether they mean to de&s;troy the government or not, they mu&s;t be wicked; they go about their de&s;ign by more in&s;idious means, art will be u&s;ed, and pains taken to promote a di&s;like to a certain law, this evil prejudice is encouraged until it becomes general among the peo|ple, and they become as ripe for in&s;urrection as in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. Nor would the evil cea&s;e with the de&s;truction of one law: they may declare they mean to &s;top at that one act, but having de&s;troyed it, and finding their power above that of the government, is it not to be apprehended that they would de&s;troy another, and another, and &s;o on to any number they di&s;approve of: if they would not be particular in one ca&s;e, they would not in another. During the we&s;tern in&s;ur|rection the ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;e law was unpopular: in this ca&s;e it is the hou&s;e tax act, and if this is permitted, it will be impo&s;&s;ible to know where we can re&s;t &s;ecure, nor how &s;oon the government it&s;elf will fall a prey. This rea&s;on may account for the introduction into the Engli&s;h &s;tatute book, and our con&s;titution, with the determination of the courts in both countries, of the principle that an attempt by force and violence to impede the operation of a &s;ingle act &s;hall be trea&s;on, and under the de&s;cription of levying war, as much as what &s;hall at fir&s;t appear more dangerous, &s;ince the effect may be the &s;ame.</P>
<P>There is another preliminary point, meriting a few ob&s;ervations, that is with re&s;pect to the proclamation of the Pre&s;ident. It was contended that, becau&s;e that proclamation required the people to di&s;|per&s;e, and commit no more crimes, it amounted to a pardon of all they did before. It is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve here, that had this ob|jection been &s;eriou&s;ly made, a plea of pardon upon the ground of that proclamation mu&s;t have been preferred, or it could not have been admitted. But the plea was not made, nor if it had, would it have been effectual, becau&s;e, if this did amount to a pardon, it did &s;o only on certain conditions; the attorney of the United States and the party are both allowed to &s;how whether or not the pri&s;oner has complied with the conditions of the pardon. It is po&s;&s;ible al&s;o that the pardon has not been offered in &s;uch a manner as the con&s;titution permits, in which ca&s;e the attorney mu&s;t be permitted to put in a demurrer. Of the force of the&s;e objections the court are to decide, and of cour&s;e the plea mu&s;t be referred to them.</P>
<P>Again, this pardon might have been pleaded in due &s;ea&s;on. Of this the coun&s;el for the pri&s;oner were informed, and had time to con|&s;ider, but they did not choo&s;e to avail them&s;elves of it. But if it had been propo&s;ed, nothing is more clear to me than its in&s;ufficiency; for in my view, the proclamation contained no pardon at all. The cir|cum&s;tances which gave ri&s;e to, and the nature of the proclamation, ran thus: Certain information was received by the government of a
<PB N="170" REF="037104_0174_100D7E6DDC9B5958">
di&s;turbance having broken out in that part of the country, which, baffled the power of civil authority, but as it is nece&s;&s;ary to prevent any in&s;urrection with as little trouble as po&s;&s;ible, after inferior means have failed, the law provides that the Pre&s;ident &s;hall make proclama|tion, inviting and commanding &s;uch di&s;turbers of the public peace to di&s;per&s;e in quietne&s;s to their homes by a certain time: this mu&s;t be done before the military can be ordered out again&s;t them. This is in order to prevent more people joining the &s;tandard of rebellion after|wards, and to admoni&s;h others not to commit farther crimes, but there is not a word in the proclamation implying an offer of pardon for any thing committed before.</P>
<P>The riot act of England was cited in &s;upport of this doctrine, but there is no &s;imilarity in the two ca&s;es: that act &s;ays, a magi&s;trate &s;hall go to the mob, and endeavor to prevail upon them to di&s;per&s;e, if he cannot do it, he reads the act, and if they &s;till continue combined, they are guilty of felony, but then this felony is a crime created merely by that act, but even that act does not intimate that they &s;hould be pardoned for crimes committed before the magi&s;trate came, even if they do di&s;per&s;e. In&s;tances to the contrary might be cited.</P>
<P>Having now, gentlemen of the jury, &s;tated my opinion in the be&s;t manner in my power on the law, independant of the facts, or the particular application of that law to the pri&s;oner at the bar, I &s;hall, agreeable to my duty, &s;tate to you in the be&s;t manner I am capable of, the nature of the i&s;&s;ue which you are now called upon to deter|mine. It is an i&s;&s;ue of an a&s;pect the mo&s;t awful and important that any juror can ever be called upon to determine. It is your duty to dive&s;t your&s;elves of all manner of prejudice and partiality one way or the other. Di&s;mi&s;s from your minds as much as you can all which you might have heard or thought on this ca&s;e before you came into this court, and confine your opinions merely to the evidence which has been pro|duced. No extraneous circum&s;tances whatever ought to have the lea&s;t weight with you in giving your verdict: you ought not, and I hope you will not take into your con&s;ideration at all whether the &s;afety of the United States requires that the pri&s;oner &s;hould &s;uffer, on the one hand, or whether on the other, it may be more agreeable to your feelings that he &s;hould be acquitted. It is &s;olely your duty to &s;ay whether he is guilty of the crime charged to him or not. No man can con|ceive that the intere&s;t of any government can po&s;&s;ibly make it requi|&s;ite to &s;acrifice any innocent man, and I can re&s;t perfectly &s;atisfied, which I have no doubt you al&s;o are, that this government will not, and God forbid any con&s;iderations whatever &s;hould ever influence &s;uch an action.</P>
<P>I do not think it nece&s;&s;ary to go into a minute detail of all the evidence which have been produced, it would be only mi&s;pending time. The general &s;cenes which pa&s;&s;ed at Bethlehem mu&s;t be fully in your mind; the&s;e &s;cenes are &s;upported upon the evidence of twelve witne&s;&s;es, but I think it my particular duty to bring to your recol|lection tho&s;e parts of that tran&s;action in which the pri&s;oner at the bar was concerned, leaving the re&s;t as much as po&s;&s;ible out of view. On
<PB N="171" REF="037104_0175_100D7E6F61091F70">
this occa&s;ion I mu&s;t reque&s;t the gentlemen of the bar, if in my in|&s;tance I &s;hould err in &s;tating the evidence, that they will correct me; but I &s;hall endeavor to be accurate.</P>
<P>The judge here &s;tated the prominent features of the evidence given by Me&s;&s;rs. Henry, John Burnett, William Barnet, Winters, Col. Nichols, Schlaugh, Hor&s;efield, Eyerly, Toon and Mitchel, &s;o far at related to the conduct of the pri&s;oner at Bethlehem, which, he &s;aid, he thought proper to &s;tate fir&s;t, becau&s;e the offence charged in the in|dictment was &s;aid to be committed at Bethlehem. Gentlemen, he continued, if you are not well &s;atisfied, that the overt act of <HI>treason</HI> was committed at Bethlehem, and that that overt act is &s;upported by the evidence of two witne&s;&s;es at lea&s;t, you will not find the pri&s;oner guilty.</P>
<P>Now, gentlemen, is the proper time for me to &s;tate one or two points concerning the law of evidence, of which you have heard much from the bar. As I ob&s;erved, there mu&s;t be <HI>two at least</HI> to prove that the act of trea&s;on was committed at Bethlehem. It is the opi|nion of the coun&s;el for the pri&s;oner that you mu&s;t be convinced, not only of the fact by two witne&s;&s;es,&mdash;not only that he was concerned in a certain act, but that you mu&s;t have the evidence of two wit|ne&s;&s;es, at lea&s;t, by evidence drawn from the &s;ame place, that it was done with a trea&s;onable intention, before you can pay any attention to any other evidence whatever. The fact is, that when the overt act is proved by two witne&s;&s;es, it is proper to go into evidence to &s;how the cour&s;e of the pri&s;oner's conduct at other places, and the purpo&s;e for which he went to that place where the trea&s;on is laid, and if he went with a <HI>treasonable design,</HI> then the act of trea&s;on is conclu&s;ive. In this I am &s;upported by a very re&s;pectable authority on crown law: Fo&s;ter in the ca&s;e of Deacon, from which it appears that it is enough, to prove that a rebellious a&s;&s;embly of armed men were there, and that the pri&s;oner joined them. In order to prove to you fully the de&s;ign with which the pri&s;oner went to Bethlehem and joined in this great outrage, I &s;hall &s;elect &s;ome of the evidence re&s;pecting tho&s;e previous tran&s;actions; it is not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tate the whole.</P>
<P>The judge here read the evidence of James Chapman, John Rod|rick, Cephas Childs, and William Thomas re&s;pecting the conduct of Jacob Fries, on the 5th of March, and re&s;pecting the meeting with Foulke and Rodrick near Singma&s;ter's; and al&s;o the tran&s;actions of the 6th, at Quaker town which evidence he &s;aid &s;o confirmed each other, that no doubt could be entertained.</P>
<P>We now come to the confe&s;&s;ion of the pri&s;oner, voluntarily made on his examination before judge Peters. Here is a point of law re|lied on by the pri&s;oner's coun&s;el&mdash;that no man &s;hould be convicted of trea&s;on but on the evidence of two witne&s;&s;es, <HI>or upon confession in open court.</HI> This is the provi&s;ion in England as well as here, and the meaning is, that no confe&s;&s;ion of the pri&s;oner, independant of two wit|ne&s;&s;es, or without the facts have been e&s;tabli&s;hed by two witne&s;&s;es, &s;hould be &s;ufficient to convict him: but if two witne&s;&s;es have proved a fact, the confe&s;&s;ion of the party may be received by way of confir|mation of what has before been &s;worn to. In former days in Eng|land
<PB N="172" REF="037104_0176_100D7E70E86A7B38">
it was allowed that confe&s;&s;ion out of court and the proof of the witne&s;&s;es &s;hould be &s;ufficient to warrant a conviction; but happily our con&s;titution would not admit it, if an hundred would &s;wear to it, that danger is wi&s;ely avoided. In&s;tances enough are in the recollection of the court, of a civil and criminal nature where confe&s;&s;ions have been received, but the jury are to judge from other evidence how far that is to be regarded.</P>
<P>Evidence may &s;ometimes be given which may be doubtful, and wants corroboration; you will judge whether that is or is not the ca&s;e at pre&s;ent. But if the confe&s;&s;ion of the pri&s;oner &s;hould go to confirm the evidence, if &s;worn to by two witne&s;&s;es at lea&s;t, it may be received, but unle&s;s it does go to corroborate other te&s;timony, I do not think it admi&s;&s;ible. You will con&s;ider whether any part of this confe&s;&s;ion has not before been proved by two witne&s;&s;es: if it has, it goes to corrobo|rate what they &s;ay, if it has not, you are to di&s;regard it. I think there ought to be great caution in receiving, as evidence, a confe&s;&s;ion which any man makes him&s;elf, becau&s;e it po&s;&s;ibly might be obtained from him by artifice or intimidation, with re&s;pect to this confe&s;&s;ion, you have the te&s;timony of my honorable colleague, judge Peters, that he gave the pri&s;oner deliberate warning, that he was not bound to con|vict him&s;elf, and that no intimidation was u&s;ed. Whatever objec|tions, then, there may be as to confe&s;&s;ion in general, it does not ap|ply in this ca&s;e, becau&s;e it was voluntarily given.</P>
<P>The pri&s;oner on his part introduced &s;ome witne&s;&s;es, thinking they would be favorable to him: one of them appeared to be &s;o in his te&s;ti|mony, which I &s;hall endeavor to relate, the other three did not an|&s;wer his expectation [The judge related the evidence of John Jamie|&s;on.]</P>
<P>With regard to the point of law &s;tated re&s;pecting the &s;ufficiency of the warrants, the evidence to this fact &s;hows the general di&s;po&s;ition of that part of the country to re&s;i&s;t the execution of the law, and pre|vent it by force or intimidation; our means of &s;howing that, is their conduct towards the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. Tho&s;e who were appointed to that office, &s;o far as they had it in their power, &s;howed a depo&s;ition to act as &s;uch. It is contended that their warrant ought to have been produ|ced. With re&s;pect to the blank commi&s;&s;ion which there was a &s;u&s;|picion was unlawfully filled up, there ought to have been the books produced, but it was not material. This indictment it will be ob&s;er|ved, is not for any re&s;i&s;tance to the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, or ob&s;truction of them in the di&s;charge of their duty. I &s;uppo&s;e it is not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;how that the&s;e officers were <HI>de facto</HI> engaged in the execution of the law; that they were con&s;idered as a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, and no &s;u&s;picion ever was entertain|ed but that they were properly authorized to be a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. This doubt if there was any, could be removed by reference to a very re&s;pectable authority. It was &s;ufficient if the warrants, given under the &s;eal of the commi&s;&s;ioner, were produced to the court.</P>
<P>The honorable judge entered pretty largely into the examination of the objection re&s;pecting Mr. Foulke's appointment in the place of Mr. Clarke, which he contended was not material, &s;ince the warrant was filled and he acted under it.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="037104_0177_100D7E7287375210">
With re&s;pect to another point of objection &s;tated at the bar, that the mar&s;hal in detaining the two men at Bethlehem was liable to an action, he &s;aid that under the circum&s;tances of that period he could not, becau&s;e, under certain circum&s;tances, he was warranted to call out the <HI>posse commitatus</HI> i. e. the power of the county, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, if he was likely to be overpowered: it could not be pre&s;umed that the circum&s;tance did not empower and warrant him to call them out, and therefore we may conclude that danger was really to be apprehended, and tho&s;e apprehen&s;ions mu&s;t be heightened by the arrival of tho&s;e two men in arms. In the opinion of judge Henry, who was pre&s;ent, the danger was &s;uch as to ju&s;tify the act of detention of tho&s;e two men. Was it with a view of depriving the&s;e men of their liberty? No, but &s;uppo&s;ing them to become with intent to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the re&s;cue which they acknowledged they had heard was contemplated.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, in looking to the law on this point, I do not think it is encroaching at all upon the liberty of any man to take him in cu&s;tody: an officer in &s;uch an action mu&s;t be at his peril, and could only be ju&s;tified on the exigency of the circum&s;tance: if he did it unnece&s;&s;ari|ly, a jury would teach him to take care how he &s;ported with the li|berties of his fellow citizens; but &s;uppo&s;ing, from good evidence that he was in danger of a&s;&s;ault, if he waited the United force of the a&s;|&s;ailants, &s;hall it be contended as unrea&s;onable, that the mar&s;hal &s;hould take mea&s;ures of &s;elf-defence while it was in his power, and detain what he might rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e a part of them? He &s;urely acted the part of a prudent man, and was ju&s;tifiable in the act.</P>
<P>Before I di&s;mi&s;s this general &s;ubject, I think it an indi&s;pen&s;ible duty which I owe, to declare that, excepting the &s;ingle in&s;tance, wherein I do perceive &s;ome impropriety of conduct, in the filling up the blank, commi&s;&s;ion, what has been di&s;clo&s;ed in the cour&s;e of this examination of the conduct of the commi&s;&s;ioners or a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, has reflected on tho&s;e officers the greate&s;t honor: at the &s;ame time they acted with indu&s;try, fidelity, and firmne&s;s, in the di&s;charge of that duty they did all in their power to make it ea&s;y to the people, accommodating them&s;elves to endeavor to give full &s;atisfaction, undeceiving the deluded, and re|moving the errors which the people had fallen into. If the people &s;till continued in ignorance and oppo&s;ition, tho&s;e gentlemen acquitted them&s;elves of blame, and their conduct merited high prai&s;e.</P>
<P>As to the plea of ignorance, the law &s;ays ignorance &s;hall excu&s;e no man, other wi&s;e, how could it be po&s;&s;ible to prove whether a per&s;on knew the law or not: if ignorance could excu&s;e a man of crimes, no crime would be brought to ju&s;tice, or there mu&s;t be, what is not to be expected, &s;ome &s;elf evident proof of the guilt. A compleat knowledge of the laws cannot be expected to find every corner of our country; but thus much we may &s;ay, to remove tho&s;e kinds of excu&s;e; if a man does not know when a law is pa&s;&s;ed, he knows how to obtain that information, and the law it&s;elf; for if he cannot come to Phila|delphia, or &s;ome other town where they may be purcha&s;ed him&s;elf, he has opportunity of &s;ending from time to time. But in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e any doubt could have been removed by application to the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, who were ever ready and willing to &s;how the law, and therefore no plea of ignorance can po&s;&s;ibly be &s;et up.</P>

Having &s;poken in commendation of the conduct of the commi&s;&s;i|oners and a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, perhaps it is al&s;o my duty to &s;ay that the conduct of the mar&s;hal has been equally exemplary: he did every thing in his power, by fair and honorable means, to avoid going to extremity, and as long as he had a hope of retaining his pri&s;oners, he di&s;played a degree of courage which few men would do; he even offered to ex|po&s;e his life to this armed mob, by proceeding with the pri&s;oners to Philadelphia, which he would have done but for the advice of three or four gentlemen with him, who thought it madne&s;s to proceed. He accordingly de&s;i&s;ted, and in the event delivered up the pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>This trial has la&s;ted &s;o many days, that we mu&s;t be all very much fatigued; and I declare, gentlemen, I have &s;carce had power to examine the various points with minute attention, much le&s;s to pre|pare &s;o proper a &s;tatement of them as I intended to have done; the fa|tigue I have felt many nights at going out of this court has prevented me doing it: under the&s;e circum&s;tances I have no doubt of your ex|cu&s;e, which I &s;hall the more readily meet, &s;ince your fatigue mu&s;t al&s;o be very great.</P>
<P>Gentlemen of the Jury. The occa&s;ion is undoubtedly the mo&s;t awful and important that ever could ari&s;e in any country whatever: the great que&s;tion for you to decide is, whether the pri&s;oner has been guilty of levying war again&s;t the United States at Bethle|hem, in the county of Northampton, as charged in the indictment, or not&mdash;in order to di&s;cover the nature of his conduct, you mu&s;t ex|amine into the motive with which he went to Bethlehem: it is nece&s;|&s;ary for you to examine the whole of his previous actions relating thereto: if it &s;hould appear to you that the pri&s;oner formed a &s;cheme, either on the way or at Bethlehem, by any kind of force to obtain this object, then, in my opinion, you ought to declare him guilty of the charge laid in the indictment. On the contrary, if you think he had no public and evil motive in view, he is not guilty of the crime.</P>
<P>Before I di&s;mi&s;s you, gentlemen, I would remind you of one con&s;idera|tion which mu&s;t impre&s;s your minds: a great and important end of bring|ing per&s;ons guilty of public crimes to ju&s;tice is to pre&s;erve inviolate the laws of our country: men who commit crimes ought to be puni&s;hed, otherwi&s;e no &s;afety nor &s;ecurity can be had. On the other hand, it is of con&s;equence, that no man's life &s;hall be taken away unju&s;tly; if a man is not guilty of a crime, he ought not to be puni&s;hed for it; and it cannot be for the intere&s;t of the country to put a man to death for what he has not committed: therefore you are not to regard the con&s;equences, but determine merely by the facts in a manner for which you will be an&s;werable at a future day, as well as my&s;elf, for all the conduct of our lives, as well as for the verdict you now give.</P>
<P>Mr. LEWIS &s;tated a que&s;tion to the court, whether the overt act laid in the indictment in a certain county, mu&s;t not be proved to the &s;a|tisfaction of the jury, both as to fact and intention in the &s;ame coun|ty, or whether the overt act did not include both fact and intention. To which judge Iredell replied, that he con&s;idered Fo&s;ter's crown law as &s;ettling that point&mdash;when two witne&s;&s;es are produced, which proves the overt act laid in the indictment, there might be then evidence
<PB N="175" REF="037104_0179_100D7E79296219D8">
drawn from other countries re&s;pecting the intention: this is the opi|nion of judge Fo&s;ter, and it is my opinion. But there is another thing: it goes to a point which is inadmi&s;&s;ible; it is not for the court to &s;ay whether there was a trea&s;onable intention or act as charged in the indictment; that is for the jury to determine; we have only to &s;tate the laws, we therefore &s;hould have no right to give our opinion upon it. Again, if no evidence could regularly be admitted out of the county until both the fact and intention were e&s;tabli&s;hed where the crime is laid, the con&s;equence would be, that there ought to be &s;ome way of taking the opinion of the jury, whether they believed that the crime was committed at Bethlehem, before the court could pro|ceed to extraneous te&s;timony! This cannot be done, a jury mu&s;t give verdict upon all the evidence collectively; if the evidence is admitted, then the jury is bound to re&s;pect the weight of it: the competency of that evidence is for the court to decide, but the jury mu&s;t e&s;timate its weight.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion for you to decide at this time, gentlemen of the jury, is, whether upon the te&s;timony of two witne&s;&s;es there is ground to believe the act was committed, and whether, from the pri&s;oner's con|duct at Bethlehem or el&s;ewhere, it is proved to be with a trea&s;onable intention.</P>
<P>JUDGE PETERS&mdash;I think the overt act and the intention con&s;titute the trea&s;on; for without the intention the trea&s;on is not compleat. If a man goes for a private purpo&s;e, to gratify a private revenge, and not with a public or general view, it differs materially. The inten|tion may po&s;&s;ibly be gathered at the place where the act was com|mitted, or it may not; if not, evidence is admi&s;&s;ible to prove it el&s;e|where.</P>
<P>The jury then withdrew, and the court adjourned for about three hours, when they returned with the verdict GUILTY.</P>
<P>Judge Iredell then di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the jury, with the thanks of the court for their patience and attention during the very fatiguing trial.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>This trial occupied the unremitted attention of the court and jury from April</HI> 30 <HI>until May</HI> 9, <HI>inclusive,</HI> (9 <HI>days) during which time the jury never separated.</HI></NOTE></P>

<HEAD>THURSDAY, <HI>April</HI> 24.</HEAD>
<P>Before the jurors were &s;worn in, they were individually a&s;ked (upon oath) the&s;e que&s;tions: "Are you any way related to the pri&s;oner?"
<PB N="178" REF="037104_0181_100D7E7C33B88250">
They all an&s;wered, "No." <Q>Have you ever formed or delivered an opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the pri&s;oner, or that he ought to be puni&s;hed?</Q> The an&s;wer generally was, <Q>Not to my know|ledge.</Q> Some of the jurors &s;aid, they had given their &s;entiments generally, di&s;approbatory of the tran&s;action, but not as to the pri&s;oner particularly.

<P>One of the jurors (Mr. Taggert) after he was &s;worn, expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the court to be very unea&s;y under his oath: he then meant that he never had made up his mind that the pri&s;oner &s;hould be hung, but very often had &s;poken his opinion, that he was very culpable; he did not, when he took the oath, conceive it &s;o &s;trict, and therefore wi&s;hed, if po&s;&s;ible, to be excu&s;ed.&mdash;The court informed the juror, it was impo&s;&s;ible to excu&s;e him, now he was &s;worn.</P>

<P><HI>Counsel for the Prosecution,</HI> MR. RAWLE, MR. INGERSOL.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="proceedings">
<HEAD>MR. RAWLE</HEAD>
<P>Then opened the charge exhibited in the indictment&mdash;He ob&s;erved, that the jury mu&s;t be aware of the very unplea&s;ant duty he had to perform: he felt an extreme difficulty of &s;ituation&mdash;called forth by his duty to exhibit a charge again&s;t the pri&s;oner at the bar of the highe&s;t magnitude, who now &s;tood to an&s;wer, unattended by any legal advice; he felt impre&s;&s;ed with the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ticking more than u&s;ually clo&s;e to the line of his duty, which he &s;hould endeavor to di&s;|charge as faithfully as po&s;&s;ible. And he tru&s;ted that, while the jury felt their relation to their unfortunate fellow-citizen at the bar, they would, at the &s;ame time, make all &s;uitable allowance for any errors which might appear on his (Mr. Rawle's) part, though it was &s;incere|ly his de&s;ire to avoid any, either in laying down the facts or the law, which he &s;hould do under the direction of the court; and, he hoped, that the jury would carefully &s;ift and examine the law and te&s;timony which his duty called upon him to advance, in order to &s;ub&s;tantiate the charge.</P>
<P>MR. RAWLE then proceeded to open the charge&mdash;he &s;aid, he &s;hould be able to prove, that John Fries, the pri&s;oner at the bar, did oppo&s;e the execution of two laws of the United States; to effectuate which
<PB N="179" REF="037104_0182_100D7E843396AA40">
he was provided with men, who, as well as him&s;elf, were armed, with guns, &s;words, and other warlike weapons, which, by their numbers and military appearance, were &s;ufficient to accompli&s;h their purpo&s;e, which was, not only to intimidate the officers of the government appointed to execute the above laws them&s;elves; but to relea&s;e from the cu&s;tody of the mar&s;hal of Penn&s;ylvania a number of per&s;ons who were held in pri&s;on by the &s;aid mar&s;hal, and to prevent him executing proce&s;s upon others. All this was done, as &s;tated in the indictment by a combina|tion and con&s;piracy to oppo&s;e tho&s;e laws, by a large body of armed men, of whom the pri&s;oner at the bar was the chief, and commander.</P>
<P>MR. RAWLE then proceeded, under the direction of the court, to &s;tate the law.&mdash;The trea&s;on whereof the pri&s;oner was charged was, "Levying war again&s;t the United States." U. S. Con&s;t. Art. 3. Sect. 3.</P>
<P>What he a&s;ked, was levying war again&s;t the United States?</P>
<P>He conceived him&s;elf authorized, upon good authority to &s;ay, levy|ing war did not only con&s;i&s;t in open, manife&s;t, and avowed rebellion again&s;t the government, with a de&s;ign of overthrowing the con&s;titution: but it may con&s;i&s;t in a&s;&s;embling together, in numbers and by actual force, or by terror oppo&s;ing any particular law or laws. Again, there can be no di&s;tinction as to the kind or nature of the law, or the par|ticular object for which the law was pa&s;&s;ed, &s;ince all are alike the acts of the legi&s;lature, who are &s;ent by the people at large to expre&s;s their will. Force need not be u&s;ed to manife&s;t this &s;pirit of rebellion, nor is it nece&s;&s;ary that the attempts &s;hould have been &s;ucce&s;sful, to con|&s;titute the crime. The endeavor, by intimidation to do the act, whe|ther it be accompli&s;hed or not, amounts to <HI>treason,</HI> provided the object of tho&s;e concerned in the tran&s;action is of a general nature, and not applied to a &s;pecial or private purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>In order to effect the object of tho&s;e embarked in crimes of this high nature, it is well known that various means are nece&s;&s;arily employed; various acts may be perpetrated to accompli&s;h the main end: they may proceed, by the execution of &s;ome enormous crimes, as burglary, ar&s;on, robbery, or murder, either, or all of them; but even if one or all of the&s;e crimes were committed, except the purpo&s;e &s;hould be of a general nature, they may form di&s;tinct and heinous offences; but the perpetra|tors may not be guilty of trea&s;on. If a particular friend of the party had been in the cu&s;tody of the mar&s;hal; if even a number &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e &s;hould &s;tep forward and re&s;cue &s;uch a per&s;on, if it was not with a view to re&s;cue pri&s;oners <HI>generally,</HI> it would amount to no more than a re&s;cue; but, if <HI>general,</HI> it is trea&s;on. It is the views of the party that fixes the crime, and therefore only the de&s;ign is nece&s;&s;a|ry to be known.</P>
<P>To prove that this doctrine was well e&s;tabli&s;hed in the United States, Mr. Rawle turned to 2 Dallas, 346 and 355, &s;tating the opinions of the court in the ca&s;es of Vigal and Mitchel, charged with, and con|victed for trea&s;on. The attack on Gen. Nevill's hou&s;e was of this general nature, becau&s;e he was an <HI>officer</HI> appointed to execute the obnoxious law; and being to the <HI>officer</HI> and not to the <HI>man</HI> that they objected, it was thought to be trea&s;on, and that deci&s;ion was well grounded.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="037104_0183_100D7E81B762E0F8">
He ob&s;erved, that the clau&s;e in our con&s;titution was founded on a &s;tatute which was pa&s;&s;ed in England, to prevent the ever increa&s;ing and ever varying number of trea&s;ons, upon the general and undefined oppo&s;ition to royal prerogative: the &s;ituation of things was &s;uch, previous to that period, as to call forth from the &s;tateman, from the philo&s;opher, and from the divine, even in tho&s;e dark ages, the mo&s;t ve|hement complaints: in attendance to the&s;e rea&s;onable and ju&s;t mur|murs, the &s;tatute was pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Mr. Rawle was then producing an authority, when Judge Cha&s;e &s;aid, the court would admit, as a general rule, of quotations which referred to what con&s;tituted actual or con&s;tructive levying war again&s;t the king of Great Britain, in his regal capacity; or, in other words, of levying war again&s;t his government, but not again&s;t his per&s;on, be|cau&s;e it was of the &s;ame nature as levying war again&s;t the United States would be applied here: &s;o was that part called adhering to the king's enemies:&mdash;they may, any of them, be read to the jury, and the deci|&s;ions thereupon,&mdash;not as authorities whereby we are bound, but as the opinions and deci&s;ions of men of great legal learning and ability. But even then, the court would attend carefully to the time of the deci&s;ions, and in no ca&s;e mu&s;t it be binding upon our juries.</P>
<P>Mr. Rawle quoted Hawkins, B. 1. chap. 17. &s;ect. 23. as an autho|rity of authenticity to prove, that not only tho&s;e who rebelled again&s;t the king, by taking up arms with the avowed de&s;ign of dethroning him; but tho&s;e who with&s;tood his lawful authority, and who endea|vored to oppo&s;e his government; who with&s;tood the king's forces, or attacked any of hiss fortre&s;&s;es&mdash;tho&s;e, in fine, who&s;e avowed object was of a public and general and not of a private and per&s;onal nature, were guilty of high trea&s;on. He al&s;o read Sir John Friend's ca&s;e from Holt, 681. and Damarree and Pincha&s;es' ca&s;e, 8 State Trials, 289.</P>
<P>JUDGE CHACE begged the attorney to read only tho&s;e parts of the ca&s;es which referred to what could be trea&s;on in the United States, and nothing which related to compa&s;&s;ing the king's death.&mdash;It would be found, he ob&s;erved, by an attention to the la&s;t ca&s;e, that becau&s;e the intention, was a ri&s;ing to demoli&s;h ALL meeting-hou&s;es, generally, it was con&s;idered to be an in&s;urrection again&s;t the toleration act, by numbers and open force, &s;etting the law at defiance. This would be found to be the opinion in Fo&s;ter 213.</P>
<P>Mr. RAWLE &s;aid, thus he conceived it&mdash;even if the matter made a grievance of was illegal, the demolition of it in this way was, ne|verthele&s;s, high trea&s;on, becau&s;e of the people &s;o a&s;&s;embled taking the law into their own hands; thus in Fo&s;ter it would be &s;een that demoli&s;hing <HI>all</HI> baudy-hou&s;es, as &s;uch was high trea&s;on, as much as demoli&s;hing <HI>all</HI> meeting-hou&s;es, being equally an u&s;urped authority. He al&s;o read Douglas 570, Lord George Gordon's ca&s;e, when it was Lord Mansfield's opinion that any attempt, by violence, to <HI>force</HI> the repeal of a law, or to prevent its execution, is levying war, and trea&s;on.</P>
<P>He con&s;idered, from tho&s;e few authorities, that he was ju&s;tifiable in &s;aying that a ri&s;ing, with intent by force to prevent the execution
<PB N="181" REF="037104_0184_100D7E7F45DA7D48">
of a law as well as laws in general, preventing the mar&s;hal executing his warrants, and preventing the other officers charged with the ex|ecution of the laws in que&s;tion, amounted to levying war, agreeable to the con&s;titution of the United States.</P>
<P>Mr. RAWLE then proceeded to &s;tate the mo&s;t prominent facts which could be produced in the cour&s;e of the evidence, in which it would fully appear, he pre&s;umed, that John Fries, the pri&s;oner, was the mo&s;t active in his oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e laws and to every attempt to car|ry them into effect; that he in every in&s;tance &s;howed his aver&s;ion of, and oppo&s;ition to the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, and determination by threats and me|naces to prevent them doing their duty, and that whenever any force was u&s;ed, or terrific appearances held up, he was the commander and gave the orders to his men who, at times in great numbers joined him; and that finally by threats and intimidation, equally the &s;ame in the eyes of the law as force, he, the pri&s;oner, did attain his object<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to wit, the relea&s;e of a number of pri&s;oners who were confined for op|po&s;ing the execution of the law, and were actually in cu&s;tody of the mar&s;hal in a hou&s;e at Bethlehem, which by rea&s;on of his having pri|&s;oners there, and his having an armed <HI>posse</HI> to protect his lawful au|thority, was to all intents a fortre&s;s of the United States&mdash;and further that he did, compleatly for a time, prevent the execution of the laws intended, in tho&s;e parts, and thus did bid defiance to all lawful autho|rity.</P>

<P>See his former te&s;timony page 24, and page 82.</P>
<P>Mr. Henry related the fir&s;t information he received of this oppo&s;iti|on to the laws in que&s;tion, and their unwillingne&s;s to &s;uffer the a&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ments. That on application by Mr. Eyerly (the commi&s;&s;ioner) he i&s;&s;ued a number of &s;ubpoeneas to bring before him &s;undry per&s;ons to examine the&s;e facts, which he found ineffectual from the intimidations of a number of people who were met where the examinations were to be held. The witne&s;s, under&s;tanding that the mar&s;hal was to meet a number of per&s;ons upon whom he had executed proce&s;s, thought it proper to go to Bethlehem on that day, in order to prevent any extre|mities that might be attempted. He related the arrival of Keefer and Paulus and others, and afterwards of about 70 or 80 foot, generally armed with guns, having &s;hot pouches and powder horns, and al&s;o of about 50 light hor&s;emen with &s;words and pi&s;tols, that of the&s;e men

That the captain of the riflemen &s;eemed determined to relea&s;e the pri&s;oners, and indeed that was their common cry. The witne&s;s a&s;ked them if they would not allow that if the pri&s;oners had done wrong, they &s;hould &s;uffer for it: they an&s;wered they had no objections to that, but they &s;hould not be dragged to Philadelphia, they &s;hould be tried at Ea&s;ton, their own county town.

At a meeting held (per|haps at Mitchel's, p. 65 and 68.) an attempt was made to read the law, but they would not &s;uffer it: one man &s;aid, he knew the law; another &s;aid, they wanted to hear none of our damned laws, nor would hear it, and, &s;tamping his mu&s;ket on the floor, &s;aid, <Q>This is our law; we have made a law of our own, and we are determined to &s;upport it.</Q>&mdash;On the 5th of March I met John Fries, when he appeared to be very ill humoured: I a&s;ked him what was the matter? he &s;aid, the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors had been about, and they &s;hould not do it. He a&s;ked me, if they had taken the dimen&s;ions of my hou&s;e? I &s;aid they had. He a&s;ked me, if I had told any body of it? I &s;aid not. He &s;eemed very much oppo&s;ed to the law, and &s;aid, his town&s;hip &s;hould not be a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed till other parts were gone through.</P>

<HEAD>MR. RAWLE</HEAD>
<P>Said he felt him&s;elf &s;o very peculiarly &s;ituated in this ca&s;e, that he would wi&s;h the opinion of the Court. The unfortunate pri&s;oner at the bar appeared to an&s;wer to a charge, the greate&s;t that could be brought again&s;t him, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of coun&s;el, or any friend to advi&s;e with.&mdash;To me, &s;aid Mr. R. the evidence again&s;t the pri|&s;oner is extremely &s;trong. It will be recollected, that in opening the evidence, I informed the jury what points I &s;hould prove: I opened my ideas of con&s;tructive law, and produced a <HI>few</HI> authorities in &s;up|port of my opinions. I believe it will be found, that in no <HI>material</HI> point have I failed to &s;ub&s;tantiate what I fir&s;t gave notice that I could prove. I therefore conceive the charges are fully confirmed.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="037104_0195_100D80EA60C0C018">
But although, if this trial was conducted in the u&s;ual way, and coun&s;el were ready to advocate the cau&s;e of the pri&s;oner, it would now be proper on my part to &s;um up the evidence as produced to the jury, and apply it to the law, in order to &s;ee whether the crime was fixed or not&mdash;under the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, I feel very great re|luctance to fulfill, what would in other circum&s;tances be my bounden duty, le&s;t it &s;hould appear to be going farther than the <HI>rigid</HI> requi&s;iti|on of my office compels me to.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>JUDGE CHASE.</SPEAKER>
<P>&mdash;It is not unfrequent for a pri&s;oner to appear in a court of ju&s;tice without coun&s;el, but it is uncommon for a pri&s;oner not to accept of legal a&s;&s;i&s;tance. It is the peculiar lenity of our laws that makes it the duty of a court to a&s;&s;ign coun&s;el to the per&s;on ac|cu&s;ed. With re&s;pect to your &s;ituation, &s;ir, it is a matter entirely di&s;|cretionary with you whether you will &s;tate the evidence and apply it to the law or not. There is great ju&s;tice due to a pri&s;oner arraigned on a charge &s;o important as the pre&s;ent: there is great ju&s;tice al&s;o due to the government. On the one hand an innocent per&s;on &s;hall not be made to &s;uffer for want of legal a&s;&s;i&s;tance; on the other a guilty per&s;on &s;hall not e&s;cape through an undue indulgence, or the failure of the accu&s;er in a duty his office may require of him. If you do not plea&s;e to proceed, I &s;hall con&s;ider it my duty to apply the law to the facts, the pri&s;oner may therefore offer what he plea&s;es to the jury.</P>

<P> Mr. Attorney, while you are ju&s;tifiable in con|&s;idering the &s;ituation of the pri&s;oner, that he might not &s;uffer by any partial impre&s;&s;ions you may make on the jury, there is another con&s;i|deration de&s;erving attention&mdash;there is ju&s;tice due to the United States. Though I &s;ee no difficulty in re&s;ting it here, yet, po&s;&s;ibly per&s;ons who may have come into court &s;ince the trial commenced may expect &s;omething of a narrative of the tran&s;actions, and &s;uch a narrative may be of great help to the jury. I wi&s;h it to be done for the due execu|tion of public ju&s;tice, and, God knows, I do it not with a de&s;ire to injure the pri&s;oner, for I wi&s;h not the conviction of any man. It is a painful ta&s;k, but we mu&s;t do our duty. Still I think you are at li|berty to fulfil your own plea&s;ure.</P>
</SP>
<P>MR. RAWLE would, then, under a &s;olemn impre&s;&s;ion that it was his duty, take up &s;ome part of the time of the court and jury in rela|tion to the pri&s;oner at the bar, a ta&s;k rendered far more painful on his part, from the circum&s;tance of the pri&s;oner's appearing there (unex|pectedly) without coun&s;el to plead his cau&s;e. In as few words as po&s;|&s;ible he would endeavor to collect the mo&s;t prominent features of the te&s;timony which had been produced, and to apply it to the law.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="037104_0196_100D80ED35E09A40">
As he &s;tated before, Mr. Rawle &s;aid, levying war in the United States again&s;t the United States, was a crime defined by the con&s;tituti|on; in relation to the republican form of government exi&s;ting among us it could only con&s;i&s;t in an oppo&s;ition to the will of the &s;ociety, of which we all are members, declared and e&s;tabli&s;hed by a majority; in &s;hort, an oppo&s;ition to the acts of Congre&s;s, in whole or in part, &s;o as to prevent their execution, either by collecting numbers, by a di&s;|play of force, or by exhibiting that degree of intimidation which &s;hould operate, in either way, upon tho&s;e charged with the execution of the law, either throughout the United States or in any part thereof, to procure a repeal, or a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the law by rendering it impractica|ble to carry &s;uch law or laws into effect in the place &s;o oppo&s;ing, or in any other part. This offence he con&s;idered to be &s;trictly <HI>treason</HI> again&s;t the United States.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion then is, how far the ca&s;e of the pri&s;oner and his con|duct merits this definition? In order to be informed of that it was nece&s;&s;ary to call to recollection the evidence, &s;o collected, as to di&s;play the train and progre&s;s which marked its foot&s;teps from its fir&s;t dawning, till its arrival at the fatal deed denominated trea&s;on.</P>
<P>It will fir&s;t be ob&s;erved by the te&s;timony of &s;everal re&s;pectable wit|ne&s;&s;es (Me&s;&s;rs. Heckavelter, Ramich, Schymer, Ormond, and Wil|liam&s;on) that attempts were made and executed, by a combination, in which, unfortunately for him, the pri&s;oner at the bar was very ac|tive, to prevent the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors from doing the duty required of them when they accepted their office, and that this combination exi&s;ted both in Northampton and Bucks counties, and to &s;uch a degree that it was impo&s;&s;ible to carry the law into effect. In lower Milford more parti|cularly we have the evidence of four re&s;pectable gentlemen (Mr. Chap|man, a principal a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, and Mr. Rodrick, Mr. Foulke, and Mr. Childs, three a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors) who were employed in the execution of tho&s;e laws. The&s;e gentlemen &s;ay that they met with &s;uch oppo&s;ition at an early period of the in&s;urrection, as deterred Samuel Clark from under|taking the bu&s;ine&s;s at all, although he had taken upon him the office. From this difficulty, Me&s;&s;rs. Foulke, Rodrick and Childs determined that they would proceed to a&s;&s;e&s;s lower Milford town&s;hip together, which they attempted, and did not de&s;i&s;t until compelled by the extreme oppo&s;ition which their re&s;pective te&s;timony relates to have happened on the 5th and 6th of March, in their progre&s;s to, and at Quaker's town, which ill u&s;age is all corroborated by other witne&s;&s;es. This &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition to the laws, as exhibited generally, is al&s;o related by Mr. Henry and Col. Nichols, the mar&s;hal, wherein it appears that proce&s;s could not be &s;erved, and that witne&s;&s;es could not be &s;ubpoenead, being deterred from the threats made to them by this exten&s;ive com|bination; and that in the &s;erving of proce&s;s per&s;onal abu&s;e was given, as well as to the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors who attempted to execute the law. In &s;hort the law was <HI>prostrate</HI> at the feet of a powerful combination.</P>
<P>Mr. RAWLE here called to view the occurrences in Bucks county, as depo&s;ed by Me&s;&s;rs. Foulke, Rodrick, Chapman, Thomas, Mitchel, and Wiedner, exhibiting a di&s;po&s;ition to in&s;urrection by a great num|ber of per&s;ons, and who engaged in its acts; he referred to the meeting
<PB N="194" REF="037104_0197_100D80F084721B78">
at Jacob Fries's, where John Fries, the pri&s;oner at the bar, expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf as determining to oppo&s;e and continue ho&s;tile to the laws. The circum&s;tance afterwards near Singma&s;ter's, where Mr. Rodrick made his e&s;cape, and where, as well as at other times, the pri&s;oner forbade tho&s;e officers to proceed, under threats of per&s;onal danger. It ap|peared Mr. Rodrick had given offence, not by his conduct, but be|cau&s;e he came from a di&s;tance of ten or twelve miles into that town|&s;hip to pro&s;ecute his duty. However the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors met the next day, but were &s;topt at Quaker town, where they were extremely abu&s;ed.&mdash;To be &s;ure, while the pri&s;oner at the bar was in the room, and when|ever he was pre&s;ent, their abu&s;e was &s;u&s;pended, when he ab&s;ented him&s;elf, it was renewed. The papers were taken from Mr. Childs, and al&s;o from Mr. Foulke, but returned, becau&s;e they were not the identi|cal papers. Here it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved in ju&s;tice to the pri&s;oner that one more of his few good actions appeared, which Mr. Rawle wi&s;hed in his heart had been more numerous.&mdash;Fries a&s;&s;i&s;ted Mr. Foulke to get out of the hou&s;e the back way, and advi&s;ed him to keep out of the way of the men.</P>
<P>On the evening of that day they went up to Miller's town: here Mr. Rawle called to mind the me&s;&s;age delivered by John Dillinger for convening the meeting the next day; this me&s;&s;age was the fruits of a con&s;ultation held at the hou&s;e of Jacob Fries, after they left Quaker town, when they determined to proceed to Millar's town the next morning. The next morning they met and went on as far as Ritters, where it appeared they were &s;topped for a &s;hort period by young Marks, who had been &s;ent forward, with information that the pri&s;oners were gone on to Bethlehem: a doubt being &s;tarted whether they would not be too late, it was debated, and at la&s;t determined to go forward: of this latter opinion was the pri&s;oner at the bar. It was in evidence that none of tho&s;e people knew the pri&s;oners whom they were going to relea&s;e: this Mitchell and others &s;wore.</P>
<P>Here Mr. Rawle thought commenced the overt act in the indict|ment; hitherto only the general oppo&s;ition to the law, and the inten|tion with which the after conduct was perpetrated, appeared.&mdash;They proceeded to Bethlehem, and here the officer of militia, the man who derived his power from the people, the pri&s;oner, <HI>Captain John Fries,</HI> who&s;e duty, it was to &s;upport the law and con&s;titution of the United States, made a mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed figure. At Bethlehem it appeared that the pri&s;oner was to &s;tep forward to effect the &s;urrender of the pri|&s;oners, and of cour&s;e to lay pro&s;trate the legal arm of the United States. The&s;e pri&s;oners were in the lawful cu&s;tody of the mar&s;hal, he had lawful proce&s;s again&s;t them from the di&s;trict judge; they were in the hou&s;e appointed for their &s;afe keeping until they &s;hould be remo|ved; he kept guard over them, and in order to execute his office he had provided, by virtue of the powers given to the &s;heriff in the &s;eve|ral counties agreeable to law, an armed force called a <HI>posse committatus,</HI> or the power of the county. This force (about 16 or 17) he &s;uppo|&s;ed &s;ufficiently great to prevent the pri&s;oners in his charge being libe|rated, it appeared, however in the &s;equel that they were not &s;ufficient for that purpo&s;e.&mdash;The pri&s;oner with an armed force arrived at Beth|lehem,
<PB N="195" REF="037104_0198_100D80F251256398">
and proceeded on his mi&s;&s;ion to the mar&s;hal: he had a &s;word when he marched his men into the town; but it appeared that he left it when he entered on his other bu&s;ine&s;s, to wit, demanding the &s;urrender of the pri&s;oners; the mar&s;hal an&s;wered, that he could not deliver them up. John Fries then returned to his men; and from the te&s;timony of Mitchel, Barnet, and Schlaugh, (this was an import|ant part of his conduct) he &s;aid, <Q>They mu&s;t be taken by force; the mar&s;hal &s;ays he cannot deliver them up; if you are willing, we will take them by force: I will go foremo&s;t; if I drop, then take your own command.</Q> Words were followed by actions; they went into the hou&s;e, and the pri&s;oners were given up.</P>
<P>This, Mr. Rawle thought, was an unque&s;tionable, full and complete proof of the commi&s;&s;ion of the <HI>overt act,</HI> and that overt act is <HI>high treason,</HI> as laid in the third and fourth counts of the indictment, to wit, that they did, <HI>by force prevent the marshal from executing law|ful process, to him directed; and, secondly, that they did deliver, and take from him certain persons, whom he had in lawful custody;</HI> and, further, this was done by <HI>force and arms,</HI> of men arrayed in a warlike manner, and by a number exceeding one hundred per&s;ons. This the indictment ju&s;tly calls levying war, and trea&s;on.</P>
<P>To him Mr. Rawle &s;aid, there was no doubt but the act of levy|ing war was completed in the county of Bucks, independently of all tho&s;e actions at Bethlehem; for there the pri&s;oner and others were armed, and arrayed with all the appearances of war: with drums and fifes, and at times firing their pieces; and this to oppo&s;e the laws and prevent their execution, and there, by this force, they executed one, and the main part of their plan; they there did &s;et the law at de|fiance: that was part of their grand object, and was done with a ge|neral, and not with a particular view, an e&s;&s;ential ingredient in trea&s;on. Whether the&s;e actions were to be con&s;idered as a &s;eparate act of trea&s;on, or whether they were to evince the intentions of the party, it certainly mu&s;t be con&s;idered as te&s;timony, and &s;uch as mu&s;t have an important weight towards the verdict.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, &s;aid Mr. Attorney, you will con&s;ider how far the indi|vidual witne&s;&s;es are de&s;erving your credit; if you con&s;ider them worthy of being believed, and if the facts related apply to the law which I &s;ubmitted to your con&s;ideration, and which, from the &s;ilence of the court, I think you mu&s;t con&s;ider as accurate, if not I &s;hall &s;tand corrected by the court,&mdash;there can be but little doubt upon your minds, that the pri&s;oner is guilty: if it be not &s;o, in your opi|nion, you mu&s;t find him otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>I have endeavoured to do my duty with integrity. I have advanced nothing but what appears to me to be clearly &s;ub&s;tantiated; but with you, gentlemen, and with the court, I leave the truth of the opinion.</P>

<P>By the &s;ame &s;ection it is further declared, <Q>That no per&s;on &s;hall be <HI>convicted</HI> of trea&s;on, unle&s;s on the te&s;timony of <HI>two</HI> witne&s;&s;es to the <HI>same overt act;</HI> or on confe&s;&s;ion in open court;</Q> and that <Q>the Congre&s;s &s;hall have power to <HI>declare</HI> the <HI>punishment</HI> of trea&s;on.</Q></P>
<P>Too much prai&s;e cannot be given to this <HI>constitutional definition</HI> of trea&s;on, and the requiring &s;uch full proof for conviction; and declar|ing, that no attainder of trea&s;on &s;hall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture, except during the life of the per&s;on attainted.</P>
<P>This <HI>constitutional</HI> definition of <HI>treason</HI> is a que&s;tion of <HI>law.</HI> Every propo&s;ition in any &s;tatute (whether more or le&s;s di&s;tinct, whether ea&s;y or difficult to comprehend) is always a que&s;tion of <HI>law.</HI> What is the true meaning and true import of any &s;tatute, and whither the ca&s;e &s;tated comes within it, is a que&s;tion of <HI>law,</HI> and not of <HI>fact.</HI>&mdash;The que&s;tion is an indictment for <HI>levying war</HI> again&s;t (or adhering to the enemies of) the United States, is&mdash;<Q>Whether the <HI>facts</HI> &s;tated do, or do not amount to <HI>levying war,</HI></Q>&mdash;within the contemplation and con&s;truction of the con&s;titution?</P>
<P>It is the duty of the court in this ca&s;e, and in all <HI>criminal</HI> ca&s;es, to &s;tate to the jury their opinion of the <HI>law</HI> ari&s;ing on the facts; but the jury are to decide on the <HI>present,</HI> and in <HI>all criminal</HI> ca&s;es, <HI>both the law and the facts,</HI> on their con&s;ideration of the <HI>whole</HI> ca&s;e.</P>
<P>It is the opinion of the court, that any in&s;urrection, or ri&s;ing of any body of people, within the United States, to attain or effect, by <HI>force, or violence,</HI> any object of a <HI>great public nature,</HI> or of <HI>public and general (or national) concern,</HI> is a <HI>levying of war</HI> again&s;t the United States, within the contemplation and con&s;truction of <HI>the constitution.</HI></P>
<P>On this <HI>general position</HI> the court are of opinion, that any <HI>such</HI> in|&s;urrection, or ri&s;ing to re&s;i&s;t, or to prevent, <HI>by force or violence,</HI> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> execution of <HI>any</HI> &s;tatute of the United States, for levying or collecting taxes, duties, impo&s;ts, or exci&s;es; or for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the Union, or for any other object of a general nature or national concern, under any pretence, as that the &s;tatute was unju&s;t, burthen&s;ome, oppre&s;&s;ive, or uncon&s;titutional, is a levying war again&s;t the United States, within the contemplation and con&s;truction of <HI>the constitution.</HI>&mdash;The rea&s;on for this opinion is, that an in&s;urrec|tion
<PB N="197" REF="037104_0200_100D7EE1DE4027E8">
to re&s;i&s;t or prevent, <HI>by force,</HI> the execution of any &s;tatute of the United States, <HI>has</HI> a <HI>direct</HI> tendency to di&s;&s;olve all the bonds of &s;ociety, to de&s;troy all order, and all laws; and al&s;o, all &s;ecurity for the lives, liberties, and property of the citizens of the United States.</P>
<P>The court are of opinion, that military weapons (as guns and &s;words, mentioned in the indictment) are not nece&s;&s;ary to make <HI>such insurrection or rising</HI> amount to <HI>levying war;</HI> becau&s;e numbers may &s;upply the want of <HI>military weapons;</HI> and <HI>other instruments</HI> may effect the intended mi&s;chief: The <HI>legal guilt of levying war</HI> may be incurred without the u&s;e of military weapons, or military array.</P>
<P>The court are of opinion, that the a&s;&s;embling bodies of men, armed and arrayed in a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">warlike manner, for purpo&s;es <HI>only of a</HI> PRIVATE <HI>nature,</HI> is NOT TREASON; although the judges, or other peace officers &s;hould be in&s;ulted, or re&s;i&s;ted; or even great outrages committed to the per&s;ons, or property of our citizens.</P>
<P>The true criterion to determine whether <HI>acts committed</HI> are <HI>treason,</HI> or a <HI>less</HI> offence, (as a riot) is the <HI>quo animo</HI> or the intention with which the people did a&s;&s;emble. When the intention is <HI>universal,</HI> or <HI>general</HI> as to effect &s;ome object of a <HI>general public nature,</HI> it will be <HI>treason;</HI> and cannot be con&s;idered, con&s;trued, or reduced to a riot. The commi&s;&s;ion of any number of <HI>felonies, riots,</HI> or other mi&s;demean|ors cannot alter <HI>their nature,</HI> &s;o as to make them <HI>amount to treason;</HI> and, on the other hand, if the <HI>intention and acts combined amount to treason,</HI> they cannot <HI>be sunk down to a felony, or riot.</HI> The <HI>intention</HI> with which any acts (as felonies, the de&s;truction of property, or the like) are done, will &s;how to what <HI>class of crimes,</HI> the ca&s;e belongs.</P>
<P>The court are of opinion, that if a body of people con&s;pire and meditate an in&s;urrection to <HI>resist or oppose the execution of any statute of the United States by force,</HI> that they are <HI>only guilty of a high mis|demeanor;</HI> but if they proceed to carry <HI>such intention into execution,</HI> BY FORCE,&mdash;that they are guilty of the <HI>treason of levying war;</HI> and the quantum of the force employed neither <HI>lessens, nor increases</HI> the crime; whether by one hundred, or one thou&s;and per&s;ons, is wholly immaterial.</P>
<P>The court are of opinion, that a <HI>combination, or conspiracy to levy war</HI> again&s;t the United States is <HI>not treason,</HI> unle&s;s combined with an attempt to carry &s;uch combination, or con&s;piracy, into execution; &s;ome actual force, or violence, mu&s;t be u&s;ed, in pur&s;uance of <HI>such de|sign to levy war;</HI> but that it is altogether immaterial, whether the force u&s;ed is &s;ufficient to effectuate the object; <HI>any force connected with the intention,</HI> will con&s;titute the crime of <HI>levying war.</HI></P>
<P>This opinion of the court is founded on the <HI>same principles,</HI> and is, in <HI>substance,</HI> the <HI>same,</HI> as the opinion of the circuit court, for this di&s;trict, on the trials (in April 1795) of Vigol and Mitchell, who were both found guilty by the jury, and afterwards pardoned by the <HI>late</HI> Pre&s;ident.</P>
<P>At the circuit court for the di&s;trict (April term 1799) on the trial of the pri&s;oner at the bar, Judge Iredell <HI>delivered</HI> the &s;ame opinion, and Fries was convicted by the jury.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="037104_0201_100D7EE59856D9A8">
To &s;upport the pre&s;ent indictment again&s;t the pri&s;oner at the bar, <HI>two</HI> facts mu&s;t be proved to your &s;atisfaction:</P>
<P N="1"><HI>First.</HI> That &s;ome time <HI>before</HI> the finding of the indictment, there was an in&s;urrection (or ri&s;ing) of a body of people in the <HI>county of Northampton,</HI> in this State, <HI>with intent</HI> to oppo&s;e and prevent, by means of <HI>intimidation and violence,</HI> the execution of a law of the United States, intituled "An Act to provide for the valuation of lands and dwelling-hou&s;es, the enumeration of &s;laves within the United States;" OR, of another law of the United States, intituled "An Act to lay and collect a direct tax within the United States:" and that <HI>some acts of violence</HI> were committed by <HI>some</HI> of the people &s;o a&s;&s;embled, <HI>with intent</HI> to oppo&s;e and prevent, by means of intimi|dation, and violence, the execution of both, or of <HI>one</HI> of the &s;aid laws of congre&s;s.</P>
<P>In the con&s;ideration of this <HI>fact,</HI> you are to con&s;ider and determine with what <HI>intent</HI> the people a&s;&s;embled at Bethlehem, whether to effect, by force, a <HI>public</HI> or a <HI>private</HI> mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The intent with which the people a&s;&s;embled at Bethlehem, in Northampton, is a <HI>necessary</HI> ingredient t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the <HI>fact of assembling,</HI> and to be proved like any other fact, by the <HI>declarations</HI> of tho&s;e who a&s;&s;embled; or by <HI>acts</HI> done by them. When the que&s;tion is, "What is a man's intent?"&mdash;It may be proved by a number of <HI>connected cir|cumstances;</HI> or by a <HI>single fact.</HI></P>
<P>If from a careful examination of the evidence, you &s;hall be <HI>con|vinced,</HI> that the <HI>real</HI> object and intent of the people a&s;&s;embled at Bethlehem was of a <HI>public nature,</HI> (which it certainly was, if they a&s;&s;embled with intent to prevent the execution of <HI>both</HI> of the above-mentioned laws of congre&s;s, or either of them) it mu&s;t then be proved to your &s;atisfaction, that the pri&s;oner at the bar, incited, encouraged, promoted, <HI>or assisted</HI> in the in&s;urrection, or ri&s;ing of the people, at Bethlehem, and the terror they carried with them, <HI>with intent</HI> to op|po&s;e and prevent, by means of intimidation <HI>and violence,</HI> the execution of both the above-mentioned laws of congre&s;s, or either of them; and that <HI>some force</HI> was u&s;ed by <HI>some</HI> of the people a&s;&s;embled at Bethlehem.</P>
<P>In the con&s;ideration of this fact, the court think proper to a&s;&s;i&s;t your inquiry by giving you their opinion.</P>
<P>In trea&s;on, all the <HI>participes criminis</HI> are principals; there are no acce&s;&s;aries to this crime. Every act, which in the ca&s;e of <HI>felony,</HI> would render a man an acce&s;&s;ary, will, in the ca&s;e of <HI>treason,</HI> make him a <HI>principal.</HI> To render any per&s;on an <HI>accomplice and principal</HI> in <HI>felony,</HI> he mu&s;t be aiding and abetting <HI>at the fact;</HI> or ready to afford a&s;&s;i&s;tance, if <HI>necessary.</HI> If a per&s;on be pre&s;ent at a <HI>felony,</HI> aid|ing and a a&s;&s;i&s;ting, he is a principal. It is always <HI>material</HI> to con&s;ider whether the per&s;ons charged are of the <HI>same party;</HI> upon the <HI>same</HI> pur&s;uit; and under the expectation of <HI>mutual defence</HI> and <HI>support.</HI>&mdash;All per&s;ons <HI>present,</HI> aiding, a&s;&s;i&s;ting, or abetting any <HI>treasonable act,</HI> are <HI>principals.</HI> All per&s;ons, who are pre&s;ent and countenancing, and are ready to afford a&s;&s;i&s;tance, if nece&s;&s;ary, to tho&s;e who actually
<PB N="199" REF="037104_0202_100D7EE928F0CA08">
commit any <HI>treasonable act,</HI> are al&s;o <HI>principals.</HI> If a number of per|&s;ons a&s;&s;emble and &s;et out upon a <HI>common design,</HI> as to re&s;i&s;t and pre|vent, by force, the execution of any law, and &s;ome of them commit acts of force and violence, <HI>with intent</HI> to oppo&s;e the execution of any law, and others are pre&s;ent to aid and a&s;&s;i&s;t, if nece&s;&s;ary, they are all <HI>principals.</HI> If any man <HI>joins and acts</HI> with an a&s;&s;embly of people, his intent is always to be con&s;idered and adjudged to be the &s;ame as theirs; and the law, in this ca&s;e, judgeth of the <HI>intent</HI> by the FACT. If a number of per&s;ons combine or con&s;pire to effect a certain pur|po&s;e, as to oppo&s;e, by force, the execution of a law, any act of vio|lence done by any one of them, in pur&s;uance of &s;uch combination, and with intent to effect <HI>such</HI> object, is, in con&s;ideration of law, the act of all who are pre&s;ent when &s;uch act of violence is committed. If per|&s;ons collect together to act <HI>for one and the same common end,</HI> any act done by any one of them, with intent to effectuate &s;uch common end, is <HI>a fact</HI> that may be given in evidence again&s;t all of them; the <HI>act of each</HI> is evidence again&s;t ALL concerned.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not detain you at this late hour to recapitulate the facts;&mdash;you have taken notes, and they have been &s;tated with accuracy, and great candor, by Mr. Attorney.</P>
<P>I will only remark, that all the evidence relative to tran&s;actions be|fore the a&s;&s;embling of the armed force at Bethlehem, are only to &s;a|tisfy you of the <HI>intent</HI> with which the body of the people a&s;&s;embled there. If either of the three overt acts (or open deeds) &s;tated in the <HI>indictment,</HI> are proved to your &s;atisfaction, the court are of opinion, that it is &s;ufficient to maintain the indictment; for the court are of opinion that every overt act is trea&s;onable.</P>
<P>As to accomplices&mdash;they are legal witne&s;&s;es, and entitled to credit, unle&s;s de&s;troyed by te&s;timony in court.</P>
<P>If, upon con&s;ideration of the <HI>whole</HI> matter (law as well as fact) you are <HI>not</HI> fully &s;atisfied, <HI>without any doubt,</HI> that the pri&s;oner is guilty of the <HI>treason</HI> charged in the indictment, you will find him <HI>not guilty;</HI> but if, upon con&s;ideration of the <HI>whole</HI> matter, (law as well as <HI>fact</HI>) you are convinced that the pri&s;oner is guilty of the trea&s;on charged in the indictment, you will find him guilty.</P>
<P>The jury retired, for the &s;pace of two hours, and brought in their verdict, GUILTY.</P>
<P>After the verdict was given, Judge Cha&s;e, with great feeling and &s;en&s;ibility, addre&s;&s;ed the pri&s;oner, ob&s;erving that as he had no coun&s;el on the trial, if he, or any per&s;on for him, could point out any flaw in the indictment, or legal ground for arre&s;t of judgment, ample time would be allowed for that purpo&s;e.</P>

<P>The Court this morning called before them Charles De&s;hler, a ju|ror on the above trial of John Fries, who, on the fir&s;t evening of the &s;aid trial, on the adjournment of the court, &s;eparated from the jury and retired to his lodgings. Mr. Hopkin&s;on, in behalf of Mr. De&s;h|ler, produced his own affidavit, and that of two others, which proved,

that on the &s;aid evening, Charles De&s;hler was inadvertently &s;eparated from his brethren by the crowd, in going out of the jury box; that he did not know to what place the jury had adjourned; that he then proceeded to his lodgings, where he cautiou&s;ly avoided all conver&s;ation re&s;pecting the trial depending.&mdash;The court, &s;atisfied by this repre&s;ent|ation, of the innocence of Mr. De&s;hler, ordered that he be di&s;charged, and that the before-mentioned affidavit be entered on the record of the court.</P>

<HEAD>JUDGMENT. <HI>Judge Chase's Address.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The pri&s;oner being &s;et at the bar, Judge Cha&s;e, after ob&s;erving to Hainey and Gettman that what he had to &s;ay to Fries would apply generally to them, the judge proceeded&mdash;</P>
<P>JOHN FRIES&mdash;You have been already informed, that you &s;tood convicted of the <HI>treason,</HI> charged upon you by the indictment on which you have been arraigned, of <HI>levying war</HI> again&s;t the United States.&mdash;You have had a LEGAL, FAIR and IMPARTIAL trial, with every indulgence that the law would permit. Of the whole pannel, you PEREMPTORILY challenged thirty-four, and, with truth I may &s;ay, that the jury who tried you, were of your <HI>own selection and choice.</HI> Not one of them <HI>before</HI> had ever formed and delivered any opinion re&s;pecting your guilt or innocence. The verdict of the jury again&s;t you was founded on the te&s;timony of many creditable and unexception|able witne&s;&s;es. It was apparent from the conduct of the jury, when they delivered their verdict, that if <HI>innocent</HI> they would have acquitted you with plea&s;ure; and that they pronounced their verdict again&s;t you with great concern and reluctance, from a &s;en&s;e of duty to their coun|try, and a <HI>full conviction</HI> of your guilt.</P>
<P>The crime of which you have been &s;ound guilty is <HI>treason;</HI> a crime con&s;idered, in the mo&s;t civilized and the mo&s;t free countries in the world, as the <HI>greatest</HI> that any man can commit. It is a crime of &s;o deep a dye, and attended with &s;uch a train of fatal con&s;equences, that it can receive no aggravation; yet the duty of my &s;tation requires, that I &s;hould explain to you the <HI>nature of the crime</HI> of which you are convicted; to &s;how the <HI>necessity of that justice,</HI> which is this day to be admini&s;tered; and to awaken your mind to proper reflections and a due &s;en&s;e of your own condition, which I imagine you mu&s;t have reflected upon during your long confinement.</P>
<P>You are a <HI>native</HI> of this country&mdash;You live under a con&s;titution (or form of government) framed by the people them&s;elves; and under laws made by <HI>your</HI> repre&s;entatives, faithfully executed by independent and impartial judges. Your government &s;ecures to every member of the community <HI>equal liberty</HI> and <HI>equal rights;</HI> by which equality of <HI>liberty</HI> and <HI>rights</HI> I mean, that every per&s;on, without any regard to

<P>If experience &s;hould prove, that the <HI>constitution</HI> is defective, <HI>it</HI> pro|vides a mode to <HI>change or amend</HI> it, without any danger to public or|der, or any injury to <HI>social</HI> rights.</P>
<P>If Congre&s;s, from inattention, error in judgment, or want of in|formation, &s;hould pa&s;s any law in violation of the con&s;titution; or burthen&s;ome, or oppre&s;&s;ive to the people, a peaceable, &s;afe and <HI>ample</HI> remedy is provided by the <HI>constitution.</HI> The people them&s;elves have e&s;tabli&s;hed the <HI>mode</HI> by which <HI>such grievances</HI> are to be redre&s;&s;ed; and no <HI>other mode</HI> can be adopted, without a violation of the con&s;titution and of the laws.&mdash;If Congre&s;s &s;hould pa&s;s a law contrary to the <HI>con|stitution,</HI> &s;uch law would be <HI>void,</HI> and the courts of the United States po&s;&s;e&s;s complete authority, and are the only tribunal to decide, whe|ther any law is contrary to the <HI>constitution.</HI>&mdash;If Congre&s;s &s;hould pa&s;s <HI>burthensome</HI> or <HI>oppressive</HI> laws, the remedy is with their con&s;tituents, from whom they derive their exi&s;tence and authority. If any law is made, repugnant to the voice of a <HI>majority</HI> of their con&s;tituents, it is in their power to make choice of per&s;ons to repeal it; but until it is repealed, it is the duty of every citizen to &s;ubmit to it, and to give up his <HI>private</HI> &s;entiments to the <HI>public will.</HI> If a law burthen&s;ome, or even oppre&s;&s;ive in its <HI>nature</HI> or <HI>execution</HI> is to be oppo&s;ed by <HI>force,</HI> and obedience cannot be compelled, there mu&s;t &s;oon be an end to all government in this country.&mdash;It cannot be credited by <HI>dispassionate</HI> men, of any information, that Congre&s;s will <HI>intentionally</HI> make laws in violation of the con&s;titution, contrary to their &s;acred tru&s;t, and &s;o|lemn obligation to &s;upport it.

From the&s;e con&s;iderations, every one may &s;ee, that Con|gre&s;s can have <HI>no interest in oppressing their fellow-citizens.</HI></P>
<P>It is almo&s;t incredible, that a people living under the be&s;t and mild|e&s;t government in the whole world, &s;hould not only be di&s;&s;atisfied and di&s;contented, but &s;hould break out into open re&s;i&s;tance and oppo&s;ition to its laws.</P>
<P>The in&s;urrection in 1794, in the four we&s;tern counties of this &s;tate (particularly in Wa&s;hington) to oppo&s;e the execution of the laws of the United States, which laid duties on &s;tills, and &s;pirits di&s;tilled, within the United States, is &s;till fre&s;h in memory: it originated from prejudices and mi&s;repre&s;entations indu&s;triou&s;ly di&s;&s;eminated and dif|fu&s;ed again&s;t tho&s;e laws. Either per&s;ons di&s;affected to our govern|ment, or wi&s;hing to aggrandi&s;e them&s;elves, deceived and mi&s;led the ignorant and uninformed cla&s;s of the people. The oppo&s;ition com|menced in meetings of the people, with threats again&s;t the officers, which rip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ned into acts of outrage again&s;t <HI>them,</HI> and were extended
<PB N="202" REF="037104_0205_100D7EEED26CB490">
to <HI>private</HI> citizens. Committees were formed to &s;y&s;tamatize and in|flame the &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition. Violence &s;ucceeded to violence, and the collector of Fayette county was compelled to &s;urrender his com|mi&s;&s;ion and official books; the dwelling hou&s;e of the in&s;pector (in the vicinity of Pitt&s;burgh) was attacked and burnt; and the mar&s;hal was &s;eized, and obtained his liberty on a promi&s;e to &s;erve no other proce&s;s on the <HI>west side of the Alleghany mountain.</HI> To compel &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to the laws, the government were obliged to march an army again&s;t the in&s;urgents, and the expen&s;e was above one million one hun|dred thou&s;and dollars. Of the whole number of in&s;urgents (many hundreds) only a <HI>few</HI> were brought to trial; and of them only <HI>two</HI> were &s;entenced to die (Vigol and Mitchell) and they were pardoned by the late Pre&s;ident. Although the in&s;urgents made no re&s;i&s;tance to the army &s;ent again&s;t them; yet not a few of our troops lo&s;t their lives, in con&s;equence of their great fatigue, and expo&s;ure to the &s;everity of the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>This great and remarkable clemency of the government had no ef|fect upon <HI>you</HI> and the deluded people in your neighborhood. The ri&s;e, progre&s;s, and termination of the <HI>late</HI> in&s;urrection, bear a &s;trong and &s;triking analogy to the former: and it may be remembered, that it has co&s;t the United States 80,000 dollars. It cannot e&s;cape ob&s;erva|tion, that the ignorant, and uninformed are taught to complain of taxes, which are nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of government, and yet they permit them&s;elves to be &s;educed into in&s;urrections which have &s;o enor|mou&s;ly increa&s;ed the public burthens, of which their contribution can &s;carcely be calculated.</P>
<P>When citizens combine and a&s;&s;emble with intent to prevent by threats, intimidation, and violence, the execution of the laws, and they actually carry &s;uch traitorous de&s;igns into execution, they reduce the government to the alternative of pro&s;trating the laws before the in&s;urgents, or of taking nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures to compel &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. No government can he&s;itate. The expence, and all the con&s;equences therefore, are not imputable to the government, but to the in&s;urgents.&mdash;The mildne&s;s and lenity of our government are as &s;triking on the <HI>late</HI> as on the <HI>former</HI> in&s;urrection; Of nearly 130 per&s;ons who might have been put on their trial for <HI>treason,</HI> only five have been pro&s;ecuted and tried for that crime.</P>
<P>In the late in&s;urrection, you, John Fries, bore a con&s;picuous and leading part. If you had reflected, you would have &s;een, that your attempt was as weak, as it was <HI>wicked.</HI> It was the height of folly in you to &s;uppo&s;e that the great body of our citizens, ble&s;t in the enjoy|ment of a free republican government of their own choice, and of all rights civil and religious,&mdash;&s;ecure in their per&s;ons and property, and con&s;cious that the laws are the only &s;ecurity for their pre&s;ervation from violence, would not ri&s;e up as one man to oppo&s;e and cru&s;h &s;o ill-founded, &s;o unprovoked an attempt to di&s;turb the public peace and tranquillity. If you could &s;ee in a proper light your own <HI>folly</HI> and <HI>wickedness,</HI> you ought now to ble&s;s God, that your in&s;urrection was &s;o happily and &s;peedily quelled by the vigilance and energy of our govern|ment, aided by the patrioti&s;m and activity of your fellow-citizens, who
<PB N="203" REF="037104_0206_100E7F1DA18D1C80">
left their homes and bu&s;ine&s;s and embodied them&s;elves in the &s;upport of its laws.</P>
<P>The annual, nece&s;&s;ary expenditures for the &s;upport of any exten&s;ive go|vernment, like ours mu&s;t be great; and the &s;um required, can only be obtained by <HI>taxes,</HI> or loans.&mdash;In all countries the levying taxes is un|popular, and a &s;ubject of complaint. It appears to me, that there was not the lea&s;t pretence of complaint again&s;t, much le&s;s of oppo&s;ition and violence to, the law for levying taxes on dwelling-hou&s;es; and it becomes you to reflect that the time you cho&s;e to ri&s;e up in arms to oppo&s;e the laws of your country, was when it &s;tood in a very critical &s;ituation with regard to France, and on the eve of a rupture with that country.</P>
<P>I cannot omit to remind you of another matter, worthy of your con&s;ideration.&mdash;If the mar&s;hal or any of the po&s;&s;ee, or any of the four friends of government, who were with him, had been killed by you, or any of your deluded followers, the crime of <HI>murder</HI> would have been added to the crime of <HI>treason.</HI></P>
<P>In your &s;erious hours of reflection, you ought to con&s;ider the con&s;e|quences that would have flowed from the in&s;urrection, which you in|cited, encouraged, and promoted, in the character of a captain of mili|tia, who&s;e incumbent duty it is to &s;tand ready (whenever required) to a&s;&s;i&s;t and defend the government and its laws, if it had not been im|mediately quelled. Violence, oppre&s;&s;ion and rapine; de&s;truction, wa&s;te, and murder, always attend the progre&s;s of in&s;urrection and rebellion; the arm of the father would have been rai&s;ed again&s;t the &s;on; that of the &s;on again&s;t the father; a brother's hand would have been &s;tained with brother's blood; the &s;acred bands of friend&s;hip would have been broken, and all the ties of natural affection would have been di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>The end of all <HI>punishment</HI> is <HI>example;</HI> and the enormity of your crime requires that a &s;evere example &s;hould be made to deter others from the commi&s;&s;ion of <HI>like</HI> crimes in future. You have forfeited your life to ju&s;tice&mdash;let me therefore earne&s;tly recommend to you, mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider your &s;ituation&mdash;to take a review of your pa&s;t life, and to employ the very little time you are to continue in this world, in endeavors to make your peace with that God, who&s;e MERCY is equal to his JUSTICE. I expect that you are a Chri&s;tian; and as <HI>such</HI> I addre&s;s you. Be a&s;&s;ured my guilty and unhappy fellow-citizen, that without &s;erious repentance of <HI>all</HI> your &s;ins, you cannot expect happine&s;s in the world to come; and to your repentance you mu&s;t add <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>hope</HI> in the merits and mediation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The&s;e are the <HI>only terms</HI> on which pardon and forgivene&s;s are promi&s;ed to tho&s;e, who profe&s;s the <HI>Christian</HI> religion. Let me therefore again entreat you to apply every moment you have left, in contrition, &s;orrow, and repen|tance. Your <HI>day</HI> of <HI>life</HI> is almo&s;t &s;pent, and the <HI>night</HI> of <HI>death</HI> fa&s;t approaches. Look up to the Father of Mercies, and God of Comfort. You have a great and an immen&s;e work to perform, and but little time in which you mu&s;t fini&s;h it. There is no repentance in the grave; for after death comes judgment; and as you die, &s;o you mu&s;t be judged. <HI>By repentance and faith,</HI> you are the object of God's <HI>mercy;</HI> but if you will <HI>not</HI> repent, and have faith and dependance upon the merits
<PB N="204" REF="037104_0207_100D7EF44997A870">
of the death of Chri&s;t, but die a hardened and impenitent &s;inner, you will be the object of God's <HI>justice</HI> and vengeance. If you will &s;incere|ly <HI>repent and believe,</HI> God hath pronounced his forgivene&s;s; and there is no crime too great for his mercy and pardon.</P>
<P>Although you mu&s;t be &s;trictly confined for the very &s;hort remainder of your life, yet the mild government and laws which you have en|deavored to de&s;troy, permit you (if you plea&s;e) to conver&s;e and com|mune with mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel; to who&s;e pious care and con&s;olation in fervent prayers and devotion, I mo&s;t cordially recommend you.</P>
<P>What remains for me is a very painful, but a very nece&s;&s;ary part of my duty. It is to pronounce that judgment, which the law has appointed for crimes of this magnitude. The judgment of the law is, and this Court doth award "that you be hanged, by the neck, <HI>until dead:</HI>" And I pray GOD ALMIGHTY to be merciful to your &s;oul!</P>

<HEAD>The following Charge, by Judge Peters, was delivered to the Jury before the Charge of Judge Iredell, in the first Trial, and ought to precede it in Page <HI>164,</HI> but was unavoidably omitted in its proper place.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS this ca&s;e is important, both in its principles and con&s;equences, I think it my duty to give my opinion, formed with as much deliberation as the intervals of this lengthy trial would permit, on the mo&s;t prominent points of law which have been made in this cau&s;e. I have conden&s;ed my &s;entiments into as &s;hort a compa&s;s as po&s;&s;ible. I &s;hall leave remarks on the evidence, and more enlarged ob&s;ervations on the law, to the pre&s;iding judge, who will deliver to you the charge of the court. At his reque&s;t I &s;tate my individual opinion, though I do not always deem it nece&s;&s;ary, when there is an unanimity of &s;enti|ment in the court.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is <HI>treason</HI> "in levying war again&s;t the United States" for per|&s;ons <HI>who have none but a common interest with their fellow-citizens,</HI> to oppo&s;e or prevent, by force, numbers or intimidation, a <HI>public</HI> and <HI>general</HI> law of the United States, <HI>with intent</HI> to prevent its operation, or compel its repeal. Force is nece&s;&s;ary, to complete the crime; but the quantum of force is immaterial. This point was determined by this court on a former occa&s;ion, which was, though not in all cir|cum&s;tances, yet in principle and object, very analogous to the &s;ubject of our pre&s;ent inquiries. I hold my&s;elf bound by that deci&s;ion, which on due con&s;ideration, I think legal and &s;ound. I do not conceive it to be over&s;hadowed, or rendered null, by any legi&s;lative con&s;truction contained in any &s;ub&s;equent act of congre&s;s. The law, though e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by legi&s;lative acts, or &s;ettled by judicial deci&s;ions, may be al|tered by congre&s;s, <HI>by express words,</HI> in laws con&s;i&s;tent with the con|&s;titution.
<PB N="205" REF="037104_0208_100D7EF5D7023E58">
But a mere legi&s;lative con&s;truction, drawn from any act by intendment, ought not to repeal po&s;itive laws, or annul judicial deci&s;ions. The <HI>judiciary</HI> have the duty a&s;&s;igned to them of inter|preting <HI>declaring</HI> and <HI>explaining,</HI>&mdash;the <HI>Legislature</HI> that of <HI>making, altering,</HI> or <HI>repealing</HI> laws. But the deci&s;ion of a que&s;tion on the con&s;titutionality of a law is ve&s;ted in the judiciary department. I con&s;ider the deci&s;ions in the ca&s;es of Vigol and Mitchell, in full force, and founded on true principles of law. The authorities from Briti&s;h precedents and adjudications are u&s;ed as guides in our deci&s;ions. I will not enter into a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion whether we are bound to follow them; becau&s;e they are precedents,&mdash;or becau&s;e we think them rea&s;onable and ju&s;t.</P>
<P>If numbers and force can render one law ineffectual, which is tan|tamount to its repeal, the whole &s;y&s;tem of laws may be de&s;troyed in detail. All laws will at la&s;t yield to the violence of the &s;editious and di&s;contented. Although but one law be immediately a&s;&s;ailed, yet the trea&s;onable de&s;ign is completed, and the generality of intent de&s;ig|nated, by <HI>a part</HI> a&s;&s;uming the government of <HI>the whole.</HI> And thus, by trampling on the legal powers of the con&s;tituted authorities, the rights of all are invaded by the force and violence of a few. In this ca&s;e, too, there is a direct outrage on the judiciary act, with intent to defeat, by force and intimidation, the execution of a revenue law, enacted under clear and expre&s;s con&s;titutional authority. A deadly blow is aimed at the government, when its fi&s;cal arrangements are for|cibly de&s;troyed, di&s;tracted and impeded; for on its revenues its very exi&s;tence depends.</P>
<P N="2">2. Though puni&s;hments are de&s;ignated, by particular laws, for cer|tain <HI>inferior</HI> crimes, which, if pro&s;ecuted as &s;ub&s;tantive offences, and the &s;ole object of the pro&s;ecution, are exclu&s;ively liable to the penal|ties directed by tho&s;e laws, yet, when committed with trea&s;onable ingredients, the&s;e crimes become only circum&s;tances or overt acts. The intent is the gi&s;t of the inquiry in a charge of trea&s;on; and is the great and leading object in trials for this crime.</P>
<P>The de&s;cription of crimes, contained in the act, commonly called the <HI>Sedition Act,</HI> lo&s;e their character, and become but component parts of the greater crime, or evidences of trea&s;on, when the trea|&s;onable intent and overt act are proved. So it is with <HI>rescue of pri|soners;</HI> which, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, was not an independent offence, but an <HI>overt act of the treason.</HI> The&s;e were crimes&mdash;mi&s;demeanors&mdash;at common law; and might have been puni&s;hed by fine and im|pri&s;onment when &s;ub&s;tantive independent offences. But, when com|mitted with trea&s;onable intent, are merged in the trea&s;on, of which &s;edition, con&s;piracy and combination are always the harbingers. I do not think that the acts relating either to <HI>sedition</HI> or <HI>rescue</HI> have al|tered the principle, though they have defined and bounded the puni&s;h|ments. The law, as to trea&s;on, is the &s;ame now, as if tho&s;e offences were &s;till puni&s;hable at common law. The <HI>Sedition Act</HI> cannot con|&s;titutionally alter the de&s;cription o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the crime of <HI>treason,</HI> to which the combination and con&s;piracy to perpetrate this offence, with force and numbers, are e&s;&s;ential attributes. Numbers mu&s;t <HI>combine</HI> and <HI>conspire</HI>
<PB N="206" REF="037104_0209_100D7EF773051C88">
to levy war. But if the&s;e indi&s;pen&s;ible qualities of the crime are, by the Legi&s;lature, declared only <HI>misdemeanors,</HI> and &s;eparated from the trea&s;onable act, the Legi&s;lature nullify the de&s;cription of <HI>treason</HI> con|tained in the con&s;titution; and &s;o indirectly alter and de&s;troy, or make inefficient, this part of that in&s;trument. The congre&s;s neither po&s;&s;e&s;s, nor did they intend to exerci&s;e, any &s;uch power. They could not (nor did they &s;o intend) place the crime declared in the con&s;titution to be <HI>treason,</HI> among the inferior cla&s;s of offences, by de&s;cribing &s;ome of its e&s;&s;ential qualities in the Sedition Act, and pre&s;cribing puni&s;h|ments, when they &s;olely con&s;titute &s;ub&s;tantive and independent offen|ces. Congre&s;s can only (as they have done) pre&s;cribe the puni&s;hment for <HI>treason,</HI> regulate the trial, and direct the mode in which that pu|ni&s;hment is to be executed.</P>
<P N="3">3. However indi&s;putably requi&s;ite it may be to prove, by two wit|ne&s;&s;es, the overt act for which the pri&s;oner at the bar &s;tands indicted, yet evidence may be given of other circum&s;tances, or even of other overt acts, connected with that on which the indictment is grounded, and occurring or committed in any other part of the di&s;trict, than the place mentioned. Although the pri&s;oner be not on his trial, nor is he now puni&s;hable, for any other than the overt act laid, other overt acts and other circum&s;tances, parts of the general de&s;ign, may never|thele&s;s be proved, to &s;hew the <HI>quo animo&mdash;the intent</HI>&mdash;with which the act laid was committed. Indeed the trea&s;on would be complete, by the con&s;piracy, in any part of the di&s;trict, to commit the trea|&s;onable act at Bethlehem, if any had, in con&s;equence of the con&s;pira|cy, marched or committed any overt act for the purpo&s;e, though the actual re&s;cue had not taken place. So we thought in the ca&s;es of the we&s;tern in&s;urgents, that the trea&s;on, concocted at Couche's fort, would have been complete, if any had only marched to commit the crime; though the de&s;ign had not arrived to the di&s;graceful cata&s;trophe it finally attained. Indi&s;putable authorities might be produced to &s;up|port this po&s;ition.</P>
<P N="4">4. The confe&s;&s;ion of the pri&s;oner may be given in evidence as cor|roboratory proof of the <HI>intent,</HI> or <HI>quo animo.</HI> But, although proved by two witne&s;&s;es, being made <HI>out of court,</HI> it is not of it&s;elf &s;ufficient to convict. Two witne&s;&s;es are nece&s;&s;ary to prove the overt act. But the intent may be proved by one witne&s;s, collected from circum&s;tances, or even by a &s;ingle fact.</P>
<P N="5">5. The doctrine of <HI>constructive treason</HI> has produced much real mi&s;|chief in another country; and it has been, for an age, the &s;ubject of di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, among lawyers, other public &s;peakers and political writers. The greater part of the objections to it are totally irrelevant here.&mdash;The &s;ubject of them is unknown, and may it ever remain &s;o, in this country. I mean the compa&s;&s;ing the death of the king. It will be found that the Briti&s;h judges, &s;ince the days of political darkne&s;s and bigotry have pa&s;&s;ed away, are to be found among the mo&s;t able and decided oppo&s;ers of the abu&s;es of this doctrine. They do not follow deci&s;ions and precedents rooted in bad times, becau&s;e they find them in their law books. On the contrary, on a fair inve&s;tigation it will be proved, that tho&s;e contrary to ju&s;tice, rea&s;on and law are reject|ed
<PB N="207" REF="037104_0210_100D7EF945E840B8">
It is not fair and &s;ound rea&s;oning to argue again&s;t the nece&s;&s;ary and indi&s;pen&s;able <HI>use</HI> of con&s;truction, from the <HI>abuses</HI> it has produced. What is there among the be&s;t of <HI>human</HI> (and I wi&s;h I could not add <HI>divine</HI>) &s;y&s;tems which has not been perverted and abu&s;ed? That there mu&s;t be &s;ome defined &s;en&s;e and interpretative expo&s;ition made of the terms <HI>"levying war,"</HI> and when, and in what circum&s;tances, it is le|vied <HI>"against the United States,"</HI> cannot be denied. The able coun|&s;el, in this ca&s;e, who has &s;aid the mo&s;t on this &s;ubject, and travelled the farthe&s;t into the gloomy, dark and tyrannical periods of the Briti&s;h hi&s;tory and juri&s;prudence, for melancholy and di&s;gu&s;ting proofs of atro|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ious abu&s;es, and even crimes, committed under color of law, has, unavoidably, him&s;elf furni&s;hed al&s;o proofs of the nece&s;&s;ity we are under of &s;ome con&s;tructive or interpretative expo&s;itions. He, at fir&s;t, confined the&s;e expo&s;itions to <HI>three</HI> ca&s;es. Now if there is a nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>one,</HI> it &s;hews that without &s;upplementary interpretation, the law would be a mere dead letter. Aware of the dangerous lengths to which the abu&s;es of con&s;truction have been carried, courts and juries &s;hould be cautious in their deci&s;ions; but not &s;o much alarmed about <HI>abuses,</HI> as to refrain from the proper and nece&s;&s;ary <HI>use</HI> of interpretation. I do not then he&s;itate to &s;ay, that the po&s;ition we have found e&s;tabli&s;hed, to wit, that oppo&s;ition, by force and numbers, or intimidation with intent to de|feat, delay or prevent the execution of a general law of the United States, or to procure, or with a hope of procuring, by force and num|bers, or intimidation, its repeal or new execution, is trea&s;on by levy|ing war again&s;t the United States. And it does not appear to me to be what is commonly called <HI>constructive,</HI> but <HI>open and direct</HI> trea&s;on, in levying war again&s;t the United States, within the plain and evident meaning and intent of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P N="6">6. As to the objections, founded on want of proof of regular ap|pointments under, and of the proper execution of the law called the hou&s;e tax law, I do not &s;ee that they apply. If the pro&s;ecution was definitely for oppo&s;ing one or more officer or officers of this tax law, the proof might be more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">igidly required. But as all the nece&s;&s;ary u&s;e made of the&s;e collateral and &s;ubordinate circum&s;tances, relative to the tax law officers, is for the purpo&s;e of &s;howing the <HI>quo animo</HI> or <HI>intent</HI> with which the trea&s;on alledged was committed, I con&s;ider them as not relevant in this cau&s;e. It is even enough in criminal pro&s;ecu|tions, more directly aimed at the &s;pecific offence of oppo&s;ing au offi|cer, that he was an officer <HI>de facto.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. As to the di&s;arming and confining the two Videlles, or advance, of the armed in&s;urgents, by the mar&s;hal at Bethlehem, I think him legally as well as prudentially ju&s;tified in his conduct. Even a con&s;ta|ble has a right to re&s;train and confine, under &s;trong circum&s;tances of &s;u&s;picion, per&s;ons who&s;e conduct or appearance evidence an intention to commit illegal and violent acts. Much more &s;o was the mar&s;hal (having notice of an intended re&s;cue of his pri&s;oners) ju&s;tifiable in &s;eizing and di&s;arming two of the armed body, again&s;t whom exi&s;ting circum|&s;tances rai&s;ed &s;trong and evident &s;u&s;picion. But I think this has been made more important than it really is. Becau&s;e the relea&s;e of the&s;e men was not the object of, or even know to the pri&s;oner at the bar
<PB N="208" REF="037104_0211_100D7EFF34A5F378">
and his party, when they commenced their trea&s;onable march, for the relea&s;e of the pri&s;oners in the mar&s;hal's cu&s;tody, at Bethlehem.</P>
<P N="8">8. The Pre&s;ident's proclamation &s;hould have been <HI>pleaded</HI> as a par|don, if it was intended to be relied on as &s;uch. This not having been done, it is not legally before us. But &s;ince it has been mentioned, I think it nece&s;&s;ary to declare it as my opinion, that it does not ope|rate as a pardon to precedent offences. It is directed by law as a &s;tep, preparatory to applying an armed force, again&s;t tho&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed to have committed crimes and embodied for unlawful purpo&s;es. It is a hu|mane warning, calculated to prevent the effu&s;ion of blood? Its allega|tions of facts, or its injunctions, have no operation in the trial of the pri&s;oner at the bar.</P>
<P>Whether the pri&s;oner is or is not guilty of the trea&s;on laid in the indictment, in the manner and form therein &s;et forth, it is your pro|vince to determine. It is the duty of the court to declare the law; though both facts and law, which I fear are too plain to admit a rea|&s;onable doubt, are &s;ubjects for your con&s;ideration. We mu&s;t all obey our public duty, whatever may be our private feelings. Mercy is not depo&s;ited in our hands. It is entirely within the con&s;titutional autho|rity of another department.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="proceedings">
<P>The following opinion of Judge Peters on the motion for a new trial was put into our hands after the &s;heet was printed were it &s;hould have come in, which is page 45 of the appendix.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH I am not perfectly &s;atisfied with the te&s;timony, which is contradicted by the juror on his oath; I will allow it to be taken for granted; and meet the que&s;tion on principle. I am in &s;entiment again&s;t granting the motion for a new trial. Becau&s;e&mdash;1. The juror &s;aid no more than all friends to the laws and the govern|ment were warranted in thinking and &s;aying, as the facts appeared then to the public. Fries being generally alledged to be the mo&s;t prominent character, it was on this account, and <HI>not with special or particular malice,</HI> that Rhoad's declaration was made.</P>
<P N="2">2. If a juror was rejected on account of &s;uch declarations, trials, where the community at large are intimately affected by crimes of &s;uch general importance and public notoriety, mu&s;t be had, in all pro|bability, by tho&s;e who only openly or &s;ecretly approved of the con|duct of criminals. This would be unju&s;t and improper, as it affects the government in its public pro&s;ecutions. Little &s;ucce&s;s could be expected from proceedings again&s;t the mo&s;t atrocious offenders, if great multitudes were implicated in their delu&s;ions, or guilt.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is natural for all good citizens when atrocious crimes, of a public nature, are known to have been committed, to expre&s;s their abhorrence and di&s;approbation, both of the offences and the perpetra|tors. It is their duty &s;o to expre&s;s them&s;elves. This is not like the
<PB N="209" REF="037104_0212_100D800800C6F1B0">
ca&s;e of murder, or any offence again&s;t as individual; or where &s;eve|ral are charged and none remarkably prominent. In this latter ca&s;e &s;electing <HI>one</HI> out of the ma&s;s might evince <HI>particular malice.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. I have no doubt that declarations of an oppo&s;ite complexion could be proved; and yet the jurors were unanimous in their verdict. The defendant has had a fair, and I think an impartial trial.</P>
<P>But as a divi&s;ion in the court, might le&s;&s;en the weight of the judg|ment if finally pronounced, and the great end of the law in puni&s;h|ments being <HI>example,</HI> I, with &s;ome reluctance, yield to the opinion of judge Iredell. Although ju&s;tice may be <HI>delayed,</HI> yet it will not <HI>fail,</HI> ei|ther as it re&s;pects the United States, or the pri&s;oner.</P>

<P>The cau&s;e was opened by the attorney of the di&s;trict, (Mr. Rawle) who &s;tated the nature of the offence of which the pri&s;oner &s;tood in|dicted, and adduced a number of witne&s;&s;es on the part of the pro&s;ecu|tion. Several witne&s;&s;es were al&s;o produced on the part of the pri&s;oner. Mr. Ro&s;s and Mr. Hopkin&s;on, who were the coun&s;el a&s;&s;igned by the court for the pri&s;oner, very ably and ingeniou&s;ly defended his cau&s;e, at &s;ome length; and were fully an&s;wered by Mr. Inger&s;ol on the part of the pro&s;ecution. Judge Cha&s;e, in an elegant, learned and feeling charge, addre&s;&s;ed the jury, informing them of the law, and reciting the facts as they appeared in evidence. The jury retired about twenty minutes pa&s;t 11 o'clock at night. Judge Cha&s;e informed the jury, pre|vious to their retiring, that the court would wait till twelve o'clock, to &s;ee if they could agree on their verdict; and that they mu&s;t return to court and inform whether they could agree or not. At that hour the jury returned and informed the court, that they could not agree. The judges ordered that the jury be kept together in &s;ome conve|nient

place till Monday morning at ten o'clock, to which time the court adjourned.</P>
<P>On Monday morning the jury returned a verdict, NOT GUILTY.</P>
<P>An indictment was afterwards filed again&s;t the defendant for con|&s;piracy, ob&s;truction of proce&s;s, re&s;cue and unlawful combination, on which he &s;ubmitted to the di&s;cretion of the court.</P>
<P>Without any farther examination, the court being fully appri&s;ed of his conduct, Judge Cha&s;e pa&s;&s;ed the following &s;entence:</P>
<P>That he be impri&s;oned two years, and fined 800 dollars, at the ex|piration of which, to give &s;ecurity for his good behavior, him&s;elf in 2000 dollars, and two &s;ureties in 1000 dollars each, and to &s;tand com|mitted till the &s;entence is complied with.</P>
<P>Before the &s;entence, Mr. Ro&s;s addre&s;&s;ed a few words to the court in his behalf: he ob&s;erved, that though his client had offended again&s;t the laws of his country, yet he had been deceived into his oppo&s;ition: it had been &s;aid, from what he thought undoubted authority, that no &s;uch law was in exi&s;tence. As this was the ca&s;e, and as his circum|&s;tances were low, he hoped the court would con&s;ider his &s;ituation.</P>
<P>JUDGE CHASE &s;aid, he was a mo&s;t <HI>atrocious</HI> offender; he had not the lea&s;t doubt but he was guilty of trea&s;on in a high degree, and that the verdict ought &s;o to have been found, and <HI>be</HI> have been made an example of. There mu&s;t have been &s;ome mi&s;take as to evidence, or the jury could not have returned a verdict of NOT GUILTY.</P>

<P>THE jury being impannelled, Mr. M'Kean appeared as coun&s;el for the pri&s;oners generally, and Mr. Dallas more particularly for George Shaeffer.</P>
<P>COLONEL NICHOLS</P>
<P>The mar&s;hal was the fir&s;t evidence called. He related the cir|cum&s;tances which occurred at Millar's town as it re&s;pected the re&s;cue of Shankweiler, (&s;ee page 37.) and the ab&s;ence of Shaeffer, who hear|ing that a bill of indictment was found again&s;t, him came to the city to deliver him&s;elf up.</P>
<P>SAMUEL TOON</P>
<P>Was next called. His depo&s;ition related to the conduct of the two Schwartz's and Stahler, differing very little from his former re|lation &s;ee (page 53 and 55) He was advi&s;ed by old Schwartz to go to Bethlehem and take his trumpet, but was unwilling, however, at length he complied.</P>

<P>Related the &s;ame facts in &s;ub&s;tance as before, (page 56.) He &s;aw Chri&s;tian Ruth going to Bethlehem, and while he was pre&s;ent heard &s;ome per&s;on &s;ay they would take the pri&s;oners from the mar&s;hal.</P>

<P>Was next &s;worn. He related the affairs generally as before re&s;pect|ing the conduct of Stahler page 26. and Shiffert page 82. al&s;o of old Schwartz, who appeared to pride him&s;elf in having two fine boys at Bethlehem.</P>
<P>JOHN FOGLE</P>
<P>A lieutenant in Jarrett's troop related &s;ome of the circum&s;tances previous to the march to Bethlehem&mdash;his evidence had nothing &s;triking in it, as he did not go him&s;elf, except that Shiffert at Millars town advi&s;ed him to go to Bethlehem; and that if they would not take bail for Shankweiler, they would not let them go to Philadelphia.</P>
<P>JOHN MORETZ</P>
<P>Depo&s;ed that he &s;aw Stahler with others who &s;aid that they would go to Bethlehem to &s;ee what they were going to do with the pri&s;on|ers&mdash;they did not &s;ay they would relea&s;e the pri&s;oners&mdash;he did not know them any way active in breeding di&s;contents. At a meet|ing to read the law, (page 49) one, he believed George Shaeffer &s;aid it was no law, and if it was, they would not &s;ubmit to it. He talked very loud, and appeared much di&s;&s;atisfied.</P>
<P>JACOB EYERLY</P>
<P>Went through his former evidence of the meeting at Schymer's page 49. and related the general &s;tate of di&s;contents through that part, and the pro&s;trate &s;tate of the laws: many he &s;aid objected to &s;uffer the execution of the hou&s;e law, becau&s;e it was not &s;igned by Mr. Jeffer&s;on as Vice Pre&s;ident (he being ab&s;ent at its pa&s;&s;ing)&mdash;Old Schwartz told the witne&s;s that two of his &s;ons were there at Bethle|hem, and that he had per&s;uaded Toon to go, promi&s;ing him a dollar, and lending him an hor&s;e, advi&s;ing him to take his trumpet that they might make a good appearance: that Daniel Schwartz, jun. tore off Mr. Balliott's cockade at Miller's town, and that they were both very abu&s;ive.</P>

CHRISTIAN HICKAVELTER</P>
<P>Depo&s;ed, That he was an a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or in Upper Milford; he related the great difficulties attending the execution of his duty. Did not know any thing more of the defendants than what was related by Mr. Eyerly of George Shaeffer, page 49. He &s;poke of the elder Schwartz as a very quiet good neighbor,</P>
<P>JUDGE PETERS</P>
<P>Then was &s;worn, to prove an examination of Schwartz, &s;en. taken before him, which acknowledged that he had per&s;uaded Toon to go to Bethlehem, and that he was there him&s;elf, but that he did nothing, nor &s;aid any thing about the re&s;cue; but that he went merely out of curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>JACOB SERNHER</P>
<P>Depo&s;ed, That he was told by George Shaeffer to tell Judge Henry to inform the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors not to come into Millar's town to a&s;&s;e&s;s the hou&s;es; for that there was a man in town who was provided with a &s;word and pi&s;tols, and that he would not &s;uffer the hou&s;es to be a&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed. He did not mention to the witne&s;s who the man was.</P>
<P>DANIEL REISCH</P>
<P>Depo&s;ed, That George Shaeffer had told him that he would not &s;uffer his hou&s;e to be mea&s;ured, and he was a damned &s;tampler if he &s;uffered them to mea&s;ure his: That if the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or came into their town, he &s;hould not come out again with his life: that they had bound them&s;elves together to oppo&s;e the execution of the law; and if he, the defendant, was to be put to pri&s;on, there would be fifty men unite to take him out.</P>
<P>JOHN SCHYMER, <ABBR>ESQ</ABBR></P>
<P>Related the circum&s;tance of the meeting at his hou&s;e, as depo&s;ed by Mr. Eyerly, and that Shaeffer was very violent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The evidence applied to the defendants individually, is given more particularly in the charge of Judge Iredell.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The evidence being gone through, Mr. M'Kean ro&s;e in the defence, in the cour&s;e of which he went through a variety of authorities to prove, that no con&s;piracy was formed, becau&s;e no compact whatever was entered into by the parties to &s;upport each other, each individual acting and &s;peaking, &s;o far as they went, &s;eparately. Here he read, 1 Hawk, 346. chap. 72, and the Sedition Act. &s;ect. 1. As to the re&s;cue he &s;aid, it did not appear that the defendant were engaged, for
<PB N="215" REF="037104_0218_100D801D1CB332D0">
a re&s;cue could not be accompli&s;hed without force, but no force what|ever had been proved upon them, 4 Black&s;tone, 131, and 345; 2 Hawk. c. 21. &s;ect. 1&mdash;3; Pierre Williams, 484; 6 Comments, 230, and 2 Hawk, c. 19, &s;ect. 5, were the authorities he read. As to the oppo&s;ition to the law, it appeared that they had doubts, which, in their uncultivated &s;tate, and extreme want of knowledge, were well ground|ed, that the law was in exi&s;tence. He then concluded with a review of the part which the defendants were &s;everally &s;aid to have taken in the tran&s;action.</P>
<P>JUDGE PETERS</P>
<P>Read the legal definition of force in 2 Hawkins, page 37.</P>
<P>MR. DALLAS went into a lengthy defence of George Shaeffer, after which Mr. Rawle, attorney for the di&s;trict, went into a definition of the different counts in the indictment of con&s;piracy, unlawful com|bination, re&s;cue, and ob&s;truction of proce&s;s, applying the evidence &s;o as to bring the charges home on the &s;everal defendants: that they all had been guilty of con&s;piracy he thought incontrovertible; becau&s;e when a con&s;piracy was formed, all who were ever pre&s;ent, as well as tho&s;e more actively engaged in it were guilty, though &s;ome might be &s;uperiors and &s;ome &s;ubordinate. All the defendants were a&s;&s;embled, and therefore partook of the crime. Five of them were &s;een at Beth|lehem: Andrew Shiffert &s;aw Ruth going to Bethlehem, and Toon &s;aw him at Bethlehem in company with the di&s;turbers of the public peace. Old Schwartz was at Bethlehem, and was engaged in coun&s;elling and advi&s;ing an unlawful a&s;&s;embling there, which was calculated to defeat the act. Young Schwartz was at Bethlehem, and al&s;o was engaged in the in&s;ult upon Mr. Balliott to tear off his cockade. George Shaeffer was at Bethlehem; but, though not in arms, though not guilty of the re&s;cue, was frequently engaged in oppo&s;ition to the law, in con&s;piracy again&s;t it, and in ob&s;truction of proce&s;s, on which account he may be ranked among the mo&s;t guilty. On the whole, he con&s;idered that each of them partook of the crimes charged in the indictment.</P>
<P>JUDGE IREDELL, in his charge to the jury, ob&s;erved, that there were three counts in the indictment: Fir&s;t. Con&s;piracy to prevent the execution of the law: to rai&s;e a con&s;piracy, &s;everal mu&s;t be en|gaged, but it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved that <HI>every one</HI> engaged, or joined there|with, was guilty of the con&s;piracy. It was not nece&s;&s;ary, under this indictment, as under that lately before the court for trea&s;on, that two witne&s;&s;es &s;hould &s;ub&s;tantiate any one fact, one would do; nor was it nece&s;&s;ary that any writing or agreement &s;hould be drawn between the parties to create it a con&s;piracy: a meeting was held, the object of which was but too well authenticated by previous conduct.</P>
<P>The &s;econd count concerned the re&s;cue of the pri&s;oners. It had been &s;tated that actual force mu&s;t be u&s;ed to make it a re&s;cue: the learned judge &s;aid, that if the object was obtained by intimidation, and the pri&s;oners were &s;urrendered, it did not differ from force in the
<PB N="216" REF="037104_0219_100D801F1703D0B0">
lea&s;t, in a legal view: for if an highway-man was to put a pi&s;tol to the brea&s;t of another, and demand his money, as had been &s;tated by Judge Peters, in the ca&s;e, 2 Hawk 37, and the money was delivered, it was a robbery, though the pi&s;tol had not been fired. The que&s;tion was, were not the threatenings held out to the mar&s;hal the immediate cau&s;e of his &s;urrendering the pri&s;oners, in order to prevent lives being lo&s;t? With regard to the arre&s;t, no doubt could be entertained that the Lehi pri&s;oners, as well as Ireman and Fox, were compleatly in the mar&s;hal's cu&s;tody. There are only two kinds of e&s;cape, one is voluntary, and the other is negligent: the former is where the officer is agreeable to the e&s;cape, the latter, as in the ca&s;e before the jury, is, the officer not having power to keep them, &s;uffers them to go at large.</P>
<P>The third count re&s;pects ob&s;truction of proce&s;s. The judge &s;aid he did not think it right to convict either of the defendants of the whole three counts, becau&s;e the re&s;cue nece&s;&s;arily implied ob&s;tructions of proce&s;s, no man could be guilty of a re&s;cue without ob&s;truction of proce&s;s, and therefore the counts re&s;olved them&s;elves into two; if it was the opinion of the jury that either of them were guilty of the whole, the verdict need only be given on the two fir&s;t, to wit: con|&s;piracy and ob&s;truction of proce&s;s. As to the con&s;piracy, it cannot be po&s;&s;ibly doubted but there was one.</P>
<P>The judge then took up the individual conduct of the &s;everal de|fendants, after the following order:&mdash;<HI>First.</HI></P>
<P>DANIEL SCHWARTZ, SEN.</P>
<P>By the evidence of the mar&s;hal and of William Barnet, he was &s;een at Bethlehem, but he behaved civily, and was come there to know what they were doing. Chri&s;tian Ruth &s;aw him there. Judge Henry depo&s;es, that he appeared to pride him&s;elf in his two fine boys who were there. Mr. Eyerly did not know that he was active there, but he appeared quite jovial: he &s;aid he had two &s;ons there; that he re|que&s;ted Toon to go there, and advi&s;ed him to take his trumpet to look well. It was given in evidence, when told of his &s;on pulling Mr. Balliott's cockade from his hat, that if he had &s;een his &s;on do it, he would have whipped him, and he appeared to be &s;orry &s;o much in&s;ult was given to the mar&s;hal at Millar's town. Mr. Schymer &s;ays he was at the meeting at his hou&s;e, but cannot &s;ay he mi&s;behaved.</P>
<P>DANIEL SCHWARTZ, JUN.</P>
<P>The mar&s;hal thinks he &s;aw him at Millar's town, where he &s;eemed to be a pretty active and bu&s;y young man. Toon &s;aw him at Beth|lehem, but without uniform, and cannot &s;ay he mi&s;behaved, or inter|fered. Mr. Eyerly &s;aw him at Millar's town behaving very abu|&s;ive, and threatening to beat them, and he thinks it was him who tore the cockade from Mr. Balliott's hat.</P>

<P>GEORGE SHAEFFER</P>
<P>Was &s;een at Bethlehem by Shiffert, but without arms or uniform. William Barnet &s;aw him there; he &s;aid he was come there only to &s;ee &s;ome of his neighbors going to Philadelphia; he &s;aid if the mar&s;hal wanted to take him, he would give him&s;elf up: he did not appear to be one of the rioters. Judge Henry &s;aw him at Bethlehem; he did not appear to be violent, or u&s;e any offen&s;ive language; he &s;aw him much out of doors with the company, but not active. John Moretz &s;aw him at the meeting at Schymer's, where he talked very loud, as though he wi&s;hed to prevent Mr. Eyerly reading the law; and on &s;ome of them doubting whether it was a law or not, be &s;aid, even if it was, they would not &s;ubmit to it. Mr. Eyerly and Mr. Schy|mer depo&s;ed the &s;ame, and that, he added "here I am, take me to gaol, but you &s;hall &s;ee how far you will bring me;" on which a number adds, "Yes, let them but take one to gaol, we will &s;oon have him out again." Mr. Heckawelter &s;ays, that he told him he had abu&s;ed his father &s;omething about a liberty pole, and that be was come to give him a licking for it, for which he followed him. Mr. Sterner &s;ays, he told him to tell Judge Henry about the man with &s;word and pi&s;tol, who would oppo&s;e the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. Mr. Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ch depo&s;ed, that the defendant &s;aid he was a damned &s;tampler, if he &s;uffered his hou&s;e to be mea&s;ured; he would not: that if the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or came into his town|&s;hip, he would not come out again alive; and if they were to take him to pri&s;on, there would be fifty men to take him out again. Mr. Schymer &s;aid, that the defendant was very much again&s;t choo&s;ing a&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors, and was pretty violent; that he abu&s;ed Mr. Heckawelter about the liberty pole.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="037104_0221_100D80230DE2DAF8">
The judge &s;aid, he &s;hould forbear &s;peaking particularly as to the nature of the combination or con&s;piracy; but, if it was not prede|termined, after meeting together there, the very act of meeting be|came a con&s;piracy; if the defendants came there after it began, not having a previous knowledge of it, it was their duty to have with|drawn them&s;elves; but if they did engage them&s;elves voluntarily and knowingly, though they knew nothing of it before, it was deemed in law equally as much a combination as though they had predeter|mined it.</P>
<P>The jury withdrew, and next morning returned with the following verdict:</P>
<P>CHRISTIAN RUTH, HENRY STAHLER, and HENRY SHIFFERT, GUILTY, as to the re&s;cue.</P>

<P>"THOUGH the crimes of which you have been convicted, in &s;ome "re&s;pects, are different in their nature, yet they all have refer|ence to one common object, that of defeating, by force of arms, the execution of an act of the Congre&s;s of the United States.&mdash;You and your confederates &s;ucceeded &s;o far, as totally to prevent, in one mode or other, the execution of that act, in a very important part of this &s;tate. The act thus daringly oppo&s;ed, which was for the collection of tax on lands and hou&s;es, was framed with particular anxiety for the relief of the poorer part of the community, and the burthen of it mu&s;t fall principally on the rich. The ignorance of it which was affected, was without the lea&s;t color of excu&s;e, becau&s;e information was offered, which was repeatedly rejected, and in &s;ome in&s;tances with tumult and di&s;dain. Neither could you fairly alledge any ground for di&s;content, on account either of the character or conduct of the officers concerned, becau&s;e the former appears to have been perfectly unexceptionable, and the latter in general meritorious in the highe&s;t degree, as they united with that firmne&s;s which their duty required, every endeavor con&s;i&s;tent with it, to give all the information in their power, and to execute the law in the manner mo&s;t convenient for the people. By your ill conduct, however, and that of your a&s;&s;ociates, a con&s;iderable part of the three counties was inflamed into a &s;tate of in&s;urrection; the

law in que&s;tion lo&s;t all its efficacy: officers were in&s;ulted&mdash;and at length that daring and infamous outrage was perpetrated at Bethlehem where a body of the militia it&s;elf marched in military array, and by force re&s;cued a number of pri&s;oners from the cu&s;tody of the mar&s;hal, who&s;e conduct on that occa&s;ion for courage, di&s;cretion, and propriety in every re&s;pect, is above all prai&s;e. In con&s;equence of &s;uch defiances of the con&s;titution and laws of your country, and the numbers and &s;trength by which they were &s;upported, it became the indi&s;pen&s;ible duty of the government to exert the powers with which it was inve&s;ted to &s;uppre&s;s this combination, and bring the principal perpetrators of it to a trial for the offences they had committed. The civil magi&s;trates having lo&s;t all their authority, (notwith&s;tanding &s;ome of them exerted them&s;elves in an extraordinary manner, which de&s;erves the la&s;ting e&s;|teem and gratitude of their country) a melancholy nece&s;&s;ity aro&s;e for employing a military force, which chiefly con&s;i&s;ted in volunteer corps, who had nobly embodied them&s;elves to defend the con&s;titution, and laws of the United States, whenever any occa&s;ion &s;hould ari&s;e, though undoubtedly hoping that their &s;ervices would be required, rather again&s;t the foreign enemies of their country, than any within the bo&s;om of it. The &s;ervices of the&s;e gentlemen have been attended with great benefit to their country, and great honor to them&s;elves; but there is too much rea&s;on to fear they mu&s;t have &s;u&s;tained much per&s;onal in|convenience, for which, as well as for other private injuries, and a great additional expence and inconvenience to the public, the authors of tho&s;e outrages are alone accountable. You have each of you un|dergone a fair and impartial trial, and have been convicted of one or more offences charged again&s;t you, for which it is now the duty of the court to pronounce the &s;entence of the law upon you. The di&s;|cretion which the law has confided to us, we have endeavored to exe|cute to the be&s;t of our judgment, con&s;idering on the one hand the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of making proper examples to deter others from the commi&s;&s;ion of the like offences, which it &s;eems to have been &s;uppo&s;ed would always pa&s;s with impunity, and on the other hand paying a due regard to the various circum&s;tances which appear to have di&s;criminated the conduct of each of you.</P>

<HEAD>An ab&s;tract of the trial of JACOB EYERMAN, on an indictment for breaking pri&s;on, con&s;piracy to oppo&s;e the law for laying a direct tax, and a tax on hou&s;es, and for coun&s;elling and advi&s;ing an un|lawful combination and con&s;piracy&mdash;</HEAD>
<P>Before the honorable BUSHROD WASHINGTON and RICHARD PE|TERS, e&s;quires, in the circuit court of the United States, held at Norri&s;town, in the county of Montgomery, and &s;tate of Penn&s;ylva|nia.</P>
<P>WEDNESDAY, <HI>October</HI> 16, 1799.</P>
<P>The pri&s;oner being arraigned, pleaded <HI>Not Guilty.</HI></P>
<P>After the jury were &s;worn, Mr. <HI>Rawle,</HI> attorney for the di&s;trict, opened the pro&s;ecution by &s;tating to the jury the &s;um of the indict|ment to be divided into three &s;eparate and di&s;tinct charges, proceeding from the &s;ame tran&s;action, and partaking of the &s;ame guilt:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, he &s;aid he &s;hould prove that there was or warrant i&s;&s;ued by the judge of the di&s;trict to take the per&s;on of the pri&s;oner into the cu&s;tody of the mar&s;hal, which was effected, but that he did break pri&s;on and go at large, until by another warrant he was afterwards taken in the &s;tate of New-York.</P>
<P>Secondly, He &s;hould prove that the pri&s;oner was engaged in a con|&s;piracy, to oppo&s;e the operation of two laws of the United States, by intimidating the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors while in the di&s;charge of their official duty.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That the pri&s;oner did coun&s;el and advi&s;e an unlawful com|bination
and con&s;piracy to prevent tho&s;e laws being carried into effect.</P>
<P>It was only three years and a half &s;ince he came into this country,&mdash;and though he had a&s;&s;umed the re&s;pectable character of a mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel; though in that capacity he was bound to preach up &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the laws of the country, yet, in that &s;hort time, he had
<PB N="221" REF="037104_0224_100D802B1CF65A38">
recommended, both by his advice and example, in oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e laws by which the whole community were bound.</P>
<P>Mr. Rawle then related &s;ome circum&s;tances that ocourred at Beth|lehem, to which place the defendant was brought pri&s;oner, and in the cu&s;tody of the mar&s;hal, but availing him&s;elf of the opportunity there given to the pri&s;oners to e&s;cape, in&s;tead of again delivering him&s;elf up, he immediately fled, left the country, and &s;eque&s;trated him&s;elf in a remote part of the &s;tate of New-York, where he was di&s;covered, and again taken into cu&s;tody. This, he &s;aid, was puni&s;hable at com|mon law, independent of the &s;edition law lately pa&s;&s;ed, which only went to explain the common law, and in many ca&s;es to <HI>ameliorate its rigor.</HI></P>
<P>Col. NICHOLS the Mar&s;hal,</P>
<P>Depo&s;ed, that he received a warrant, by virtue of which the pri|&s;oner was arre&s;ted, and brought into his cu&s;tody at Bethlehem, and that he was re&s;cued, together with the other pri&s;oners, by an armed force on the 7th of March la&s;t. The witne&s;s then related the tran&s;|actions attending his journey to, and at Millar's town, and at Bethle|hem previous to the re&s;cue.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See the first trial of Fries.</HI></NOTE> After the pri&s;oners were re&s;cued, John Fries expre&s;&s;ed a great &s;olicitude for the &s;afety of Eyerman by return|ing, not having &s;een him among the others, and a&s;king me where was the <HI>minister?</HI> I told him that he was out of the hou&s;e; he &s;aid he was not, however he went out again, and there &s;eeing him, ap|peared perfectly &s;atisfied. After this man was liberated, captain Jar|ret &s;aid he could now march off his men. Upon the whole it &s;eemed that Eyerman's deliverance was a particular object with tho&s;e people. He promi&s;ed when in the room that if he was re&s;cued he would meet me the day following at Philadelphia to deliver him&s;elf up, but he did not, and I never knew what become of him till he was brought back by the deputy mar&s;hal of New-York.</P>
<P>JACOB EYERLY,</P>
<P>Commi&s;&s;ioner for the di&s;trict, related the appointment of the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ors in the different town&s;hips, and depo&s;ed, That the pri&s;oner, at a meeting held in Hamilton town&s;hip, told the people that Congre&s;s had no right to pa&s;s &s;uch a law, and if the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors were to come to his hou&s;e he would tell them &s;o, and not let them proceed to take his rates.</P>
<P>Mr. Eyerly and Judge HENRY both, informed the court of the ge|neral di&s;tracted &s;tate of that part of the country, notwith&s;tanding their endeavors to quiet the minds of the people by explanation and advice &s;o that the magi&s;tracy could not execute their duty with &s;afety; nor could the evidences called again&s;t tho&s;e who had oppo&s;ed the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, be prevailed upon, without great difficulty, to give their te&s;timony, through a dread of the rage of the people.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="037104_0225_100D802EA2009318">
JOHN SERFASS, <ABBR>ESQ</ABBR></P>
<P>Depo&s;ed, That he re&s;ided in Che&s;nut hill town&s;hip, Northampton county: that he was appointed an a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or under the law for laying a direct tax: &s;o &s;oon as the people heard that he was appointed, they were much uproared again&s;t it. The people were to a&s;&s;emble to con&s;ider the law, and I re&s;olved to go to tell the people they were doing wrong: accordingly I went, and there were 40 or 50 people a&s;&s;embled; but they were not in a military dre&s;s. This was &s;ometime in December. After I was there a &s;hort time, Jacob Eyerman, the pri&s;oner, came in, he began to rip out in a violent manner again&s;t this taxation, &s;aying, that Congre&s;s had made laws which were unju&s;t, and the people need not take up with them, if they did all kinds of laws would follow, but if they would not put up with this, they need not with tho&s;e that would come after, becau&s;e it was a free country; but in ca&s;e the peo|ple admitted of tho&s;e laws, they certainly would be put under great burdens. He &s;aid he knew perfectly well what laws were made, and that the Pre&s;ident nor Congre&s;s had no right to make them. The people in general thought that the <HI>minister</HI> was right, but I told them that he was leading them wrong. I a&s;ked them whether they had heard or &s;een the laws? They &s;aid no. I then told them the words, as near as I could recollect, but I found very little heed taken of it. Mr. Eyerman &s;aid, that the people &s;hould not let the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors take down their taxation, and that they might abu&s;e them ever &s;o much, there was no law could hurt them for doing it.</P>
<P>I &s;hortly afterwards gave notice to the people to meet at the &s;ame hou&s;e, in order to explain the law to them. Accordingly they met, and I explained the law to them, and when I left them, they appeared very peaceable.</P>
<P>The &s;econd day of Chri&s;tmas this man preached at a private hou&s;e; as &s;oon as &s;ermon was done, he went to the hou&s;e of Conrad Crazy, but he no &s;ooner came in, than he began to run out again&s;t the taxation very much. There were about fifteen or &s;ixteen people pre&s;ent. He repeated then that he knew the laws very well, and that Congre&s;s and the government only made &s;uch laws to rob the people, and that they were nothing but a parcel of damned rogues, and <HI>spitz bube,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Highwaymen or thieves.</HI></NOTE> but that they (the people) had no right to &s;ubmit to it. I told him that I had told him before to quit doing that, that it was not his duty; that his duty was to preach his &s;ermon, and to quiet the people, or decide be|tween them: if he went on that way I &s;hould bring him to &s;uch da|mage as he would not like. With that he did quit.</P>
<P>ATTORNEY. Did he, at that, or any other time, advi&s;e you not to be an a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or?</P>
<P>WITNESS. Yes. He told me often that it was better for me not to take up with that commi&s;&s;ion, perhaps it might injure me, for I might meet with &s;ome evil.</P>
<P>Were the people of your town&s;hip much oppo&s;ed to the law?</P>
<P>Yes, they were &s;o violent that I knew but one man that was the &s;ame &s;ide as my&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="037104_0226_100D8032172EC4C8">
Did you think that &s;uch proceedings would have taken place, or, if they had, that it would have ari&s;en to &s;uch an height, if it had not been for the par&s;on.</P>
<P>I am fully convinced it would not. I knew of no other per&s;on there who went about to advi&s;e the people to oppo&s;ition. He &s;aid he had a book of the laws, and either that there was no &s;uch law in it, or el&s;e that the con&s;titution forbade &s;uch laws.</P>
<P>COURT. Did Eyerman appear to be a &s;imple &s;ort of a man, ea&s;ily to be led a&s;tray, or deluded?</P>
<P>WITNESS. NO, he was not thought &s;o, he was always thought a very good preacher.</P>
<P>PRISONER to the WITNESS. Did I not tell you at Crazy's hou&s;e that I did not think any the wor&s;e of you for being an a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, be|cau&s;e you were &s;worn to &s;upport the government, and had a right to &s;peak for it?</P>
<P>WITNESS. At that hou&s;e, when I &s;poke again&s;t his conduct, he &s;aid "aye, Mr. Serfas is right, he is &s;worn to &s;upport the govern|ment."</P>
<P>PRISONER. Did I not pray for the government, Pre&s;ident and Vice-Pre&s;ident?</P>
<P>WITNESS. Yes, you did when in the pulpit, but when you were out you prayed the other way.</P>
<P>JOHN SNEIDER,</P>
<P>Depo&s;ed that he lived in Hamilton town&s;hip, and knew the pri&s;oner, who told the deponent that a body &s;hould lay out again&s;t that hou&s;e tax. As much as he under&s;tood, the pri&s;oner meant, to take arms again&s;t it.&mdash;He &s;aid that if we let that go forward, it would go on as in the old country, but that he (the pri&s;oner) would rather lay his black coat on a nail, and fight the whole week, and preach for them Sundays, than it &s;hould be &s;o.</P>
<P>ATTORNEY. How long has this man been at Hamilton?</P>
<P>WITNESS. About eighteen months.</P>
<P>The town&s;hip was always peaceable I &s;uppo&s;e before he came among&s;t you?</P>
<P>Yes, and I believe if he had not come, nothing would have happen|ed of the kind.</P>
<P>SIMON HALLER,</P>
<P>Depo&s;ed that he re&s;ided in Hamilton town&s;hip, and knew the pri|&s;oner, who was very well liked as a preacher until lately. That the pri&s;oner appeared to be in oppo&s;ition to the hou&s;e tax law, but who was the leader of it he knew not. That the pri&s;oner came to the de|ponent's hou&s;e, where conver&s;ation began about the hou&s;e tax, where|upon he &s;aid he did not care whether they put up with it or not, for he had no hou&s;e to tax. A per&s;on pre&s;ent an&s;wered but you have a great quantity of books to tax. The pri&s;oner an&s;wered that "if any body would offer to tax his books he would take a French, a Latin,</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="037104_0227_100D8033A98B6BF8">
an Hebrew, and a Greek book down to them, and if they could not read them, he would &s;lap them about their ears till they would fall to pieces." The deponent &s;aw the pri&s;oner at Hartman's when he talked much again&s;t the tax, but could not recollect what. The occa&s;ion of the people coning together then, was, that there was preaching that day. The pri&s;oner continued preacher to that congregation till he was taken up.</P>
<P>JUDGE PETERS,</P>
<P>Depo&s;ed that he i&s;&s;ued a warrant to apprehend the pri&s;oner, but he never &s;aw him until brought from New-York. He al&s;o repre&s;ented the general &s;tate of the country to be &s;uch that, knowing the county magi&s;trates could not execute their duty, he was obliged to i&s;&s;ue his warrants as judge of the di&s;trict.</P>
<P>The evidence here clo&s;ed, but the pri&s;oner, his pecuniary circum|&s;tances not enabling him to employ any coun&s;el, refu&s;ed to make any defence, but ju&s;t ob&s;erved that if he had been guilty of any thing, it was contrary to his knowledge, and he hoped, if the jury &s;hould find him guilty, that they, and the court would take his ca&s;e into con&s;ide|ration, and puni&s;h him as &s;light as po&s;&s;ible, and he would endeavor in the future cour&s;e of his life to do better.</P>
<P>Ma. RAWLE in a &s;hort addre&s;s to the jury quoted 2 Hawkins page 243. to &s;how that the pri&s;oner was in lawful cu&s;tody, and page 245. what was the force which in law made breach of pri&s;on. page 249 &s;tated that whoever broke from lawful confinement was guilty of mi&s;|pri&s;on, which was puni&s;hable by fine and impri&s;onment.</P>
<P>The act commonly called the &s;edition act, he &s;aid, &s;poke of the &s;e|cond and third counts in the indictment. (Con&s;piracy, and coun&s;elling a con&s;piracy.) Re&s;pecting the crime of con&s;piracy he quoted 2 Haw|kins page 119. which refers to Black&s;tone page 392.</P>
<P>He ju&s;t referred the jury to the te&s;timony, to prove what part the the pri&s;oner had taken in either, or all the crimes alledged.</P>
<P>JUDGE WASHINGTON delivered a charge to the following effect:</P>
<Q><TEXT LANG="eng">
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="speech">
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT cannot be nece&s;&s;ary that the court &s;hould detain you long in the charge on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. The crimes with which the pri&s;oner before you is charged are, fir&s;t, a combination with others, for the purpo&s;e of oppo&s;ing the government: &s;econdly, advi&s;ing and exciting others to this oppo&s;ition; and thirdly, in re&s;cuing him&s;elf from the hands of the mar&s;hal, in who&s;e lawful cu&s;tody he was.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ition to government &s;eldom breaks out into overt acts, unle&s;s &s;ome previous combinations have been made by per&s;ons who think them&s;elves &s;trong enough to do it with effect; and this &s;eldom happens, until &s;ome per&s;on or per&s;ons, more knowing, and more wicked than the general ma&s;s of &s;ociety, endeavors to advi&s;e and mi&s;lead the ignorant and unwary, or le&s;s de&s;igning. Thus to form a powerful combination, there mu&s;t be a regular chain for that preci&s;e purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="037104_0228_100D8035437F5AF0">
The offence or offences with which the pri&s;oner is charged is infe|rior to overt acts, and the puni&s;hment is le&s;s. The only que&s;tion for you to determine is whether, upon evidence, the pri&s;oner has been guil|ty of all or either, of the offences laid to his charge. It would be tedious and, I think, unnece&s;&s;ary for me to go through the te&s;timony, becau&s;e it mu&s;t be fre&s;h in your minds. Re&s;pecting a combination to oppo&s;e an act of Congre&s;s, the general circum&s;tances for your inquiry are &s;uch as will &s;atisfy you of the exi&s;tance of &s;uch a combination. This, I think, is proved by the frequent meetings of the people in the different town&s;hips of the counties of Northampton, Bucks, and Mont|gomery, the declarations of the people when convened, and the threats &s;o frequently thrown out by them again&s;t the government, and the of|ficers of government. Attempts were frequently made, not only by the pri&s;oner, but by others to di&s;unite the people, and to deter the public officers from executing the duty repo&s;ed in them, and which they were &s;worn to perform, by pointing out to them the dangers to which they were expo&s;ed, would they carry tho&s;e laws into execution. Unle&s;s you di&s;credit the te&s;timony which has been laid before you, and that there is no cau&s;e for doing, it appears to the court that the proof is as clear again&s;t him as any thing can po&s;&s;ibly be.</P>
<P>That he was the prime cau&s;e and advi&s;er of this oppo&s;ition appears to be proved by many witne&s;&s;es, the re&s;pectability of whom has not been pretended to be doubted.</P>
<P>Re&s;pecting the re&s;cue, the attorney of the di&s;trict has preci&s;ely laid down the law to you. It does not follow, becau&s;e a man e&s;capes from pri&s;on, or from the cu&s;tody of an officer, (which is the &s;ame in law) that therefore he is an offender within the law for which he was commit|ted: nor does it follow that he did not break pri&s;on, becau&s;e the act of force was executed by others who were in combination with him, and he in con&s;equence thereof made his e&s;cape. He con&s;ented, and &s;howed that con&s;ent, by his e&s;cape, for whether the force was u&s;ed by him&s;elf or others, is immaterial.</P>
<P>From all the te&s;timony, it appears that the pri&s;oner, in his previous conduct, took pains to &s;tir up the di&s;contents, and that the armed force came to Bethlehem to re&s;cue him, by their earne&s;tne&s;s to &s;et this man, particularly, at liberty. Farther, his &s;ub&s;equent conduct proves his offence, for if he had not been liberated by his own con&s;ent, he would have done as the others did, who left the cu&s;tody of the mar|&s;hal at the &s;ame time: he would have given him&s;elf up afterwards; but on the contrary, he fled from his country, and &s;ecreted him&s;elf, until taken by a new warrant in another di&s;trict.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, it is your bu&s;ine&s;s to bring the&s;e facts into one view, and decide whether the pri&s;oner is guilty of one, two, or all of the counts in the indictment: as you think, &s;o you are bound to find.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX. No. I. TRIAL OF JOHN FRIES FOR TREASON. <HI>Motion of Mr. Lewis for removing the Trial.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>APRIL 30.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MR. LEWIS <HI>preferred the following motion to the Court in writing.</HI></P>
<P>AND now the pri&s;oner, JOHN FRIES, being placed at the bar of this Court, at the city of Philadelphia, being the place ap|pointed by law for holding the &s;tated &s;e&s;&s;ions thereof, and it being de|manded of him if he is ready for his Trial for the Trea&s;on in the In|dictment mentioned, he moves, <HI>ore tinus,</HI> that his trial for the &s;ame offence may not be proceeded on here, and that the &s;ame may be had in the county in which the &s;ame acts of trea&s;on in the &s;aid indictment mentioned are laid, and where the offence therein mentioned is alleged to have been committed.</P>
<P>He &s;tated this motion to be founded on an act of Congre&s;s entitled the judiciary act, pa&s;&s;ed 24th September, 1789. Sect. 29, "That in ca&s;es puni&s;hable with death, the trial &s;hall be had in the county where the offence was committed, or where that cannot be done without great inconvenience, twelve petit jurors at lea&s;t &s;hall be &s;ummoned from thence." He &s;tated the advantages re&s;ulting from this &s;ection to the accu&s;ed to be, that a man might be tried by his peers, where he is known, and where there can be no difficulties to procure witne&s;&s;es in his behalf. This ine&s;timable right, he &s;aid, was one of the grounds of complaint to the United States, which promoted their &s;eparation from the mother country, and this was one cau&s;e of her taking up arms. This advantage, Congre&s;s had held in ju&s;t e&s;timation, and upon this, no innovation was to be admitted, on which account the mo&s;t pointed and po&s;itive terms were u&s;ed, and the divi&s;ions of vicinage reduced to coun|ties. But neverthele&s;s, he ob&s;erved, this rule had an exception, which was where "manife&s;t inconvenience" occurred, twelve jurymen were to be &s;ummoned from that county, and therefore before the court could con&s;ider them&s;elves authorized to proceed to the trial in that place, their honors mu&s;t be well &s;atisfied that trial could not take place in the county of Northampton without "manife&s;t inconvenience." The&s;e words did not refer to the inconvenience the judges might feel in tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|velling,
<PB N="2" REF="037104_0231_100D803C44BCFF58">
or the time &s;pent, but an inconvenience ari&s;ing from &s;ome cau&s;e which Congre&s;s did not fore&s;ee at the time of the pa&s;&s;ing of the act. The trouble and inconvenience to the judges could be no greater than to the pri&s;oners, whom the government had brought to this city.</P>
<P>Mr. Lewis &s;aid he was aware of an objection which would be rai&s;ed to the force of the &s;ection above quoted, founded on a &s;ub&s;equent law pa&s;&s;ed March 2d, 1793. &s;ect. 3. which directs that a judge of the &s;u|preme court, with a di&s;trict judge, "may direct &s;pecial &s;e&s;&s;ions of the circuit courts to be holden for the trial of criminal cau&s;e, at any con|venient place within the di&s;trict, nearer to the place where offences may be &s;aid to be committed, than the place or places appointed by by law for the ordinary &s;e&s;&s;ions." The places appointed by law for the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania are, York town and Philadelphia. This he pre|&s;umed mu&s;t refer to cau&s;es of a civil nature, or to criminal acts of a le&s;s grade than what is peremptorily required in the act fir&s;t quoted from, to govern "ca&s;es puni&s;hable with death." The &s;ame act &s;ays, that trials in capital ca&s;es &s;hould be el&s;ewhere, and not at the &s;tated places, unle&s;s manife&s;t inconvenience attend it. And what, he a&s;ked, was the great inconvenience in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e? Was there any ob|jection of a nature to render it improper or impo&s;&s;ible to try the pri|&s;oner in that county? It was true that a con&s;iderable number of per|&s;ons in that county had been mi&s;guided, but was it to be inferred thence that all were? Or that a fair trial could not be had there? No doubt an able and impartial jury might be obtained in that place, and there|fore an impartial trial could be had. In bad times, with corrupt judg|es, if ever &s;uch a time, and &s;uch judges &s;hould unhappily be in this country, the &s;ection of 1789 would form a protection to the citizen a|gain&s;t any innovation of his privilege, and prevent them dragging him from his family and friends to a di&s;tant part, where he might be un|known, to be tried.</P>
<P>Surely it could not be urged that the &s;afety of the United States, or the protection of the court, made it nece&s;&s;ary to try this cau&s;e in Phi|ladelphia. The pri&s;oners might have been confined in the gaols of that county; the troops of the United States were even now remaining there, to protect the law.</P>
<P>The vicinity of that &s;pot to the witne&s;&s;es who beheld the tran&s;actions was an additional argument for the plea. Some to be &s;ure had come to the city, others perhaps might come forward, &s;ickne&s;s or age might ope|rate to prevent &s;ome coming. It was al&s;o inconvenient to the pri&s;on|er in preventing his neighbours or relatives affording him that comfort which they might wi&s;h. But all this, he &s;aid, was immaterial, the law was definite, and nothing could &s;upercede its mandate. Here was a li&s;t of ninety-eight witne&s;&s;es, furni&s;hed the pri&s;oner by Mr. Attorney, who were to appear again&s;t him, and hence the nece&s;&s;ity of time and opportunity being allowed the pri&s;oner to examine that numerous train of evidence, and to prepare to controvert them.</P>
<P>Mr. Lewis then referred to a &s;imilar motion which he made before the court, re&s;pecting a per&s;on tried for high trea&s;on in the We&s;tern In|&s;urrection, in 1795, for which he referred to Dallas's reports, page 18, vol. 3. The motion was then rejected, but upon different grounds
<PB N="3" REF="037104_0232_100D803DCBAABD78">
than could po&s;&s;ibly be now urged. Judge Wil&s;on &s;tated it as the opi|nion of the court, the plea being made at a previous court, that the circuit court, at which the pri&s;oner was to be tried was &s;o near, that there was not time to &s;end to the witne&s;&s;es and bail, on account of the great di&s;tance of the county, from the city, as they were &s;ubpoened to attend at the next &s;e&s;&s;ion. The rea&s;on was, that the Supreme court could not order a &s;pecial &s;e&s;&s;ion to over-rule the &s;tated &s;e&s;&s;ion, aad therefore the inconvenience was <HI>great</HI> and <HI>manifest;</HI> but no &s;uch ex|cu&s;e could hold good in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e: the mandatory language of the former clau&s;e mu&s;t be obeyed.</P>
<P>Further, he ob&s;erved, that a man might be charged with the crime of trea&s;on, and committed for that crime, or bound over, if the ca&s;e would allow it, yet it was impo&s;&s;ible to know that he would be indicted for trea&s;on by a grand jury, and no court held previous to the indict|ment, could &s;ay whether it was a ca&s;e puni&s;hable with death, or a mi&s;|demeanor, and therefore the time to move the plea was the pre&s;ent time, after the indictment was returned, and when the defendant was arraigned for trial, and till then the motion would be inapplicable. He ob&s;erved that he con&s;idered this motion of con&s;iderable importance to the pri&s;oner, and not to him only, but to every citizen of the United States: this was the &s;ecurity of his rights, and tho&s;e of every man in the court, and therefore he hoped the ju&s;tice of the court would grant the plea.</P>
<P>MR. SITGREAVES &s;aid he had not been able to di&s;tingui&s;h whether this motion had been preferred to the court as a matter of unqualified right, or whether it was merely an application, as a matter of favour in this particular in&s;tance, but he would attempt an an&s;wer to both. With re&s;pect to the 29th &s;ect. of the judiciary act, if the fir&s;t part of the paragraph was to &s;tand alone, without a qualification, it would be a po&s;itive direction, and would not bear an objection, yet there would be a difficulty ari&s;e how it could be executed: But it was not &s;o. At the time that law was pa&s;&s;ed, there were &s;tated places, as well as &s;tated times for holding the federal courts, there was no provi&s;ion whatever for hold|ing them el&s;ewhere than the appointed place, although the judges had &s;pecial powers to alter the time of holding them: whether that rea&s;on, or &s;ome other, excited the legi&s;lature to put the di&s;cretion as to place in the judges al&s;o, he could not tell, but although the fir&s;t direction is po&s;itive, an alternative is immediately introduced: twelve Jurors &s;um|moned from the county where the crime was committed may &s;uffice, at the di&s;cretion of the court, and this &s;econd branch of the rule is to a|void what the court may judge a great inconvenience, again&s;t which no general rule of common law can provide.</P>
<P>In order to prevent any mi&s;-interpretation, and remove the embarra&s;&s;|ments, which a wrong u&s;e of the law of 1789 might produce, the pro|vi&s;ion of March 1793 &s;till defines that di&s;cretion, without making any material alteration: that &s;ays "the court might be held at any con|venient place within the di&s;trict, nearer to the place where the crime was committed than the place for holding the &s;tated &s;e&s;&s;ion." Certain it is that this provi&s;ion does not require it to be held in the &s;ame county; indeed it is extremely que&s;tionable, whether the court have au|thority
<PB N="4" REF="037104_0233_100D80401F1FBE30">
to remove it there; they may nearer the place, but the word "nearer" excludes the place it&s;elf; if the place was intended, the phra|&s;eology would be more accurately in&s;erted. He would now remark that no place nearer the &s;cene of in&s;urrection than this city could have been &s;elected, and here the di&s;cretion of the court had fixed it. The law mu&s;t have been made for one of two rea&s;ons: either for the facility of public ju&s;tice, or to favour the pri&s;oner. Re&s;pecting the fir&s;t, the crime was committed, not in one county only, but in three adjoining counties, and therefore agreeable to the arguments of the gentleman, the trial mu&s;t be held in three counties, by three juries, and the wit|ne&s;&s;es be harra&s;&s;ed to appear three times; but even if the court &s;hould determine upon one of tho&s;e counties for the trial, which was to be &s;elected?</P>
<P>MR. LEWIS que&s;tioned the propriety of this argument, &s;ince it ap|peared all the ca&s;es of trea&s;on except one (in Bucks) happened in North|ampton county, and no inconvenience could accrue from holding the trials at one place.</P>
<P>MR. RAWLE &s;aid that he &s;hould produce evidence to prove the crime of trea&s;on committed in the three counties.</P>
<P>MR. SITGREAVES proceeded to &s;tate that as the act of 1793 as well at 1798 left a di&s;cretion for the court to determine according to ex|i&s;ting circum&s;tances, and not according to any known definite princi|ples of law, it would be impolitic, if not illegal to hold the court in the county, this city being, agreeable to one argument next to one of the counties, and on the other view, the &s;tated place for holding the courts, the arguments mu&s;t fall, and the motion be rejected. Philadelphia, he &s;aid was as near to the place where the crime was committed as the court hou&s;e of that county, and here it was probable the purpo&s;es of public ju&s;tice could be mo&s;t compleatly an&s;wered.</P>
<P>If then the argument was not &s;upported on public convenience, it mu&s;t be the convenience of the pri&s;oner which the gentleman aimed at, but he had failed to &s;how any &s;uch thing, and therefore had precluded any an&s;wer. He had argued for the comfort of the pri&s;oner; having his neighbors about him, &amp;c. but it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved that the re&s;idence of the pri&s;oner was in Bucks, whereas the crime was committed in Northampton, and there he mu&s;t have been tried, if the deci&s;ion &s;hould turn in favor of his arguments. Now, Philadelphia was as much an adjoining county to Bucks, as Northampton, and therefore as much his vicinage, and each place of holding the courts at about equal points of di&s;tance from his re&s;idence. Even if it was held in Northampton coun|ty, it would neither facilitate the trial, nor be of advantage to the per&s;on.</P>
<P>Another que&s;tion he would &s;ugge&s;t was, whether this application was made &s;oon enough. It was nearly, or quite a week, &s;ince the in|dictment was given to the pri&s;oner, and it was a much longer time &s;ince he was committed: if it was proper that any application &s;hould be made to the court, either as a matter of right or of favour, it ought to have been made in due time, &s;o as not to delay or defeat the que&s;|tion of public ju&s;tice. It would be unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay that the que&s;|tion was fully determined in the year 1795, and if it was a matter of
<PB N="5" REF="037104_0234_100D8041A3DD8C90">
law, and as &s;uch mandatory, every ca&s;e which was the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> decided on, was a ca&s;e of mis-trial, and the whole court and council mu&s;t have been guilty of a great dereliction. But he believed it was a&s;ked of the court at that time, not as a matter of right, but of favour, and it ap|peared by the report quoted, that if the favour could have been grant|ed, it would, but the deci&s;ion was again&s;t the po&s;&s;ibility of it, and cer|tainly &s;tronger rea&s;on would have weighed for it then than now, on which account there is now at lea&s;t, equal grounds for refu&s;ing it.</P>
<P>MR. RAWLE ob&s;erved, that while he profe&s;&s;ed as much humanity as any gentleman in court, yet as council for the pro&s;ecution he felt as much de&s;ire for the ju&s;t execution of public ju&s;tice. He could &s;carcely per&s;uade him&s;elf that the gentleman who moved the court could be &s;e|rious at this late period of the bu&s;ine&s;s,&mdash;after &s;even days had elap&s;ed &s;ince the indictment was found, after all the inconveniencies of a pre|paration for trial had been incurred this new, this additional inconve|nience of &s;ummoning the witne&s;&s;es and jurors to another place, could not be either to the advantage of the pri&s;oner, or agreeable to a ju&s;t con&s;truction of the law adverted to. The law of March 1793 does not apply to a ca&s;e which the offence fir&s;t charged would make capital &s;o as to effect life. The que&s;tion &s;eriou&s;ly was, Mr. Rawle &s;aid, whether granting the motion would not deprive the country of pro&s;e|cuting the trial at all, or even after had full proof of the guilt of the pri&s;oner it would not prevent the court of the power of pa&s;&s;ing &s;en|tence. The act read by Mr. Sitgreaves gave the Judge the power to hold courts throughout his whole di&s;trict, 226, Vol. 2, Laws U. S. but the act of 1789, which fixed the place, only gave the court power as to times of holding &s;pecial &s;e&s;&s;ions 51, Vol. 1. The 29th &s;ection of that act was ab&s;olutely very ambiguou&s;ly worded, becau&s;e the fifth &s;ec|tion of the &s;ame act had put it out of the power of the court to re|move as to place. Whatever, then, was the intention of the Legi&s;la|ture, the courts had not power to effect a change, and when an act failed in explaining the intention, the intention could not be carried into execution, to remedy the inconvenience of the court, being bound in all ca&s;es as to place the clau&s;e of 1793 p. 226 pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Mr. Rawle contended that a &s;pecial court was more than an adjourn|ed circuit court: it was a &s;ub&s;tantive court of it&s;elf, held for &s;pecial purpo&s;es, and could not i&s;&s;ue <HI>certiorari</HI> for any other court; if there|fore, a &s;pecial court was to be held for this trial, it mu&s;t begin <HI>de noca:</HI> a new grand jury, and a new petit jury mu&s;t be called; the witne&s;&s;es mu&s;t be &s;ummoned anew, which would be a bad precedent, be&s;ides a great delay. The impropriety was evident: after a bill had been found the pri&s;oner had &s;een a li&s;t of the Jury and witne&s;&s;es; after having had time to calculate its chances, at the &s;eventh day of the proceeding, he came forward to remove the trial! If the pri&s;oner had not had time to enquire into the character of the jurors or witne&s;&s;es, &s;ome other rea|&s;on would have been given, but as nothing of that kind had been at|tempted, and as the inconveniences of delay and removal were &s;o mani|fe&s;t, he tru&s;ted the court would not accede to the motion.</P>
<P>MR. DALLAS declared that it was not the de&s;ign of the council for the pri&s;oner to try experiments by the pre&s;ent motion; they con|ceived
<PB N="6" REF="037104_0235_100D8044E9A0CCA0">
that he had a <HI>right</HI> to be tried, in the county where the crime was charged: the act of Congre&s;s was mandatory unle&s;s "manife&s;t in|conveniences" &s;hould appear. He conceived that di&s;tance could not be an inconvenience, becau&s;e the act contemplated the po&s;&s;ibility of crimes being committed in Allegany as well as in Che&s;ter county. Nor could time; the importance of a capital trial was not to be &s;o played with; Congre&s;s de&s;igned that an impartial trial &s;hould be had in all ca&s;es, without regard to &s;uch trivial objections. He was &s;ure the honourable court would not con&s;ider their per&s;onal inconveniences as meant, and therefore &s;hould not mention it. Mr. Dallas wi&s;hed it to be ob&s;erved that the crimes were recently committed, and public ju&s;tice had not been long &s;u&s;pended, and even if the pre&s;ent motion was acceded to, the hand of public ju&s;tice might &s;hortly give the blow, by appointing an early &s;pecial &s;e&s;&s;ion. It was not certain before the court &s;at, that a bill would be found for high trea&s;on, merely becau&s;e the parties were bound over for high trea&s;on; and therefore the pri&s;oner might not be able to meet that charge: again, the time &s;ince the bill was found and the party informed, and &s;erved with the enormous li&s;t of 98 witne&s;&s;es, has been very &s;hort; it was Wedne&s;day la&s;t, &s;even days only, two of which mu&s;t be left out, Thur&s;day having been the fa&s;t day, and Sunday inter|vening. Many of the&s;e witne&s;&s;es and jurors he had never &s;een nor heard of, and it was nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould have time to enquire who they were; there had been no catches on the part of the pri&s;oners. It would be an ea&s;y thing for the court at this time, &s;ince all the parties were upon the &s;pot, to bind them over to appear again. In the ca&s;e read by Mr. Lewis, judge Wil&s;on expre&s;sly declared that there was a de&s;ire in the court to comply, but the difficulties were in&s;urmountable. With re&s;pect to the other ca&s;es, the mandatory language of Congre&s;s impo|&s;ed a nece&s;&s;ity on the officers of ju&s;tice, where it was po&s;&s;ible. The cla&s;hing of courts, he pre&s;umed, could not be held up for excu&s;e at this time: he did not know how much time the pre&s;ent circuit might con|&s;ume, but as the &s;upreme court would not meet untill Augu&s;t, no doubt there could be a period for the bu&s;ine&s;s of a &s;pecial court &s;pared during the rece&s;s; but if the period &s;hould be filled up, in the Augu&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion arrangements might be made to hold one. With re&s;pect to the hold|ing of di&s;trict courts, Mr. Dallas ob&s;erved, that the law, Vol. 1, p. 49, 50. allowed a di&s;cretion as to the place of holding them; page 51, gives di&s;|cretion, as to the circuit court, to the judges of &s;upreme court with re&s;pect to time: the&s;e provi&s;ions re&s;pected all ca&s;es alike, within the juri&s;diction of tho&s;e courts, but the &s;ub&s;equent act referred to, made an exception with regard to ca&s;es of a nature highly criminal, or capital: certainly then, if ever the Congre&s;s meant there &s;hould be a trial at all in the proper county, one like the pre&s;ent mu&s;t come under that inten|tion. The language of the two acts, page 67, Vol. 1, and 226, Vol. 2, Mr. Dallas ob&s;erved was different. He fir&s;t declared, that ca&s;es puni&s;h|able with death &s;hould be tried in the county, &amp;c. The &s;econd, that &s;pecial circuit courts may be holden nearer the place where the offences may be &s;aid to be committed than the place of the ordinary &s;e&s;&s;ions; but one thing was worthy of notice: the fir&s;t relates only to offences <HI>punishable with death,</HI> while the other is worded at <HI>crimes</HI> only; of
<PB N="7" REF="037104_0236_100D804798F7D0B0">
whatever nature. Ca&s;es of in&s;urrection and rebellion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t have been in the view of the Legi&s;lature, and in them it would be very probable part of more than one county would combine, and they could have ex|cepted &s;uch ca&s;es if it had been meant &s;o to do. It was farther &s;aid that part of the crimes were committed in two counties, and therefore the pri&s;oner had deprived him&s;elf of the common law vicinage. This was not clear: the vicinage where the offence was committed would at any rate have it in their power to declare what they had &s;een of the conduct of the pri&s;oner. As to the &s;tage at which the application was made, no lo&s;s of time had been made, and if it was, it would be extreme|ly &s;evere, if in the power of the court to order it otherwi&s;e, that the pri&s;oner in &s;o important a ca&s;e &s;hould be injured thereby. On the whole, he tru&s;ted, without manife&s;t inconveniency &s;hould appear, that the court would grant the motion.</P>
<P>MR. LEWIS &s;aid it was &s;trange, mi&s;chievous and unfounded doctrine that this application had not been made in time: three clear days from the notice of the indictment being allowed by law to the pri&s;oner, he was not bound to an&s;wer the indictment until ye&s;terday: the trial did not then proceed, and he appeared this day, but in his &s;incere opinion, from mature reflection, two three nor four days &s;hould have weight with the court, becau&s;e the act of Congre&s;s was binding upon them, whatever the learned gentlemen had advanced to the contrary: he had a right to demand it, and if their honors, the judges, proceeded to hold the trial in any but the right place, they, and not the pri&s;oner, would offend. Mr. Attorney had &s;uppo&s;ed if this was granted, all which had been done would be null and viod, grant this for a moment, did Mr. Attorney or John Fries direct the proceedings of the grand jury, &amp;c. certainly the attorney. In this Mr. Lewis believed he had done &s;trictly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ight, here was the proper place for the i&s;&s;ue to be joined; but Northampton is the proper place for the trial of that i&s;&s;ue. It was objected becau&s;e it was &s;aid the crime was committed in three counties; but &s;uppo&s;e it were in three or thirty counties, the overt act in the bill is laid in one county only, and there only does the law &s;upport the claim for trial. The two laws referred to are unnece&s;&s;ary in capital ca&s;es, if they do extend to them at all, becau&s;e the fir&s;t law makes ample provi&s;ion not only as to time, p. 51, but as to place, p. 67. and is not &s;uperceded by the other. With reference, to the law, of 1793, page 227, which &s;ays, that criminal cau&s;es may be tried nearer to the place where the offences were &s;aid to be committed, the argument was taken up by Mr. Sitgreaves to mean <HI>nearer to the county;</HI> hence he &s;ays that Philadelphia county is the adjoining one of the in&s;urgent counties. In the Indictment Bethlehem is mentioned as the <HI>place;</HI> now the law di|rects a &s;pecial &s;e&s;&s;ion to be held nearer to Bethlehem than is Philadel|phia, that act does not &s;ay whether it &s;hall be held in or out of the coun|ty, but near the place. The gentleman appeared to have thought he was in another place, and not at the bar, in his view of the di&s;cretionary power of the court, which would leave it to be regulated according to the ebbs and flows of the pa&s;&s;ions of the judges, or the temper of the times; but he &s;hould recollect this di&s;cretion was of a legal, and not of a political nature, which the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e called for. All that
<PB N="8" REF="037104_0237_100D804A18CC82C0">
mu&s;t be con&s;idered to operate on the que&s;tion is, whether ju&s;tice can|not be done between the United States and the pri&s;oner, if the trial is held in the county of Northampton; if it can, we ri&s;e to claim this as the <HI>right</HI> of John Fries, and nearly allied to the intere&s;ts of every citi|zen.</P>
<P>JUDGE IREDELL &s;aid it was held by judge Hale, that an indictment was part of the trial; if &s;o, he fould be glad to be told what they were to do with the pre&s;ent indictment, if the trial was to be removed? if &s;o, the pri&s;oner mu&s;t be indicted as well as tried in the county. Fo&s;ter 235, and 236. Another que&s;tion would be, could the court order the di&s;mi&s;&s;al of the indictment?</P>
<P>JUDGE PETERS could not &s;ee how part of the proceedings of this court could be transferred to a &s;pecial court, and therefore how it could be removed to the county, and while a doubt remained, it would never do to renovate a criminal ca&s;e of &s;o much importance, he could not &s;ee the force of the rea&s;oning in favour of the removal. He thought that however humanity ought to lean towards a pri&s;oner, &s;till the proceed|ings of the court ought to en&s;ure ju&s;tice to the United States, and to the pro&s;ecution, and therefore that public ju&s;tice ought to be as well guarded as the pri&s;oner's convenience: a fair and impartial trial ought to be had, which he was certain could not be held in the county of Northampton, and if he were now applied to in his official capacity to take the nece&s;&s;ary &s;teps for that event he would refu&s;e.</P>
<P>MR. RAWLE &s;aid there were opportunities enough for a motion like this to be made before a bill was found, after the parties were bound over. The accu&s;ed ought to be preparing for trial from his fir&s;t com|mitment, to remove all the inconveniences which delay until after the proceedings were going on would occa&s;ion: it appeared to him to a|mount to a <HI>technical trap,</HI> laid to involve difficulties. It was well known that the pri&s;oner could not wait till it was too late to obtain many privileges to which he was entitled by an earlier attention to his intere&s;ts, of which the pre&s;ent was one. With re&s;pect to the difficul|ties his honor, Judge Iredell, had mentioned on the indictment, they were too &s;erious and important to be di&s;pen&s;ed with.</P>
<P>JUDGE IREDELL delivered his opinion to effect as follows:&mdash;With regard to the latene&s;s of the application, as it does not relate to the merits of the defence, I think the arguments in favour of the motion preponderate, and that no advantage &s;hould be taken from the pri&s;oner without full ground. It is evident that, in this ca&s;e a number of circum|&s;tances might be mentioned which would render a trial inconvenient in the county of Northampton. I am inclined to think with the council for the pri&s;oner, that the court have the power to order a &s;pecial court to be held there if they &s;hould think proper, and therefore I &s;hould not &s;cruple to admit it, if all concurrent circum&s;tances admitted its prudence. The que&s;tion then i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, whether according to the legal di&s;cretionary pow|er of the court, this court think it their duty to admit the force of the motion. When the&s;e offences were fir&s;t known to have been com|mitted, and when the gentleman with whom I have the honour to &s;it was in that country, it was po&s;&s;ible for a court to have been ordered there for trials, but it appeared to tho&s;e with whom the power re&s;t|ed,
<PB N="9" REF="037104_0238_100D804C719511C8">
to be improper. And why?&mdash;The pre&s;ident in his proclamation had publicly declared that the lawful authority of that county could not be carried into execution without the aid of a military force. Would it not therefore have been improper for us to order a &s;pecial court to be held at that place? If a &s;pecial court could not have been held there, the only thing to be done was to bind the parties over to this court.</P>
<P>There are two very important difficulties in the way of this motion, I &s;ay important, becau&s;e they are &s;uch as no gentleman of the law can be perfectly clear upon them. Fir&s;t whether, if we order a &s;pecial court, we can order, by any proce&s;s known to the law, this indictment to be transferred to that court. This is a doubt &s;tated by judge Wil&s;on, of the &s;upreme court at the time of a former motion alluded to; and I am inclined to think this was a great rea&s;on which guided the deci&s;ion, otherwi&s;e a doubt would not have been intimated. If this cannot be done, what would be the con&s;equences of the removal of the ca&s;e? If this indictment were to be taken there, with a doubt in point of law on it, a motion might be made after trial, for a new trial, that not being regular, part having been held in another place. Whether this would be moved or not I cannot &s;ay, but I know at be&s;t it is doubtful. The court therefore ought to proceed in the cleare&s;t manner not to run the ri&s;k of defeating the pro&s;ecution of a cau&s;e &s;o important. It is the great de&s;ire of this court to do the mo&s;t impartial ju&s;tice between the public and the pri&s;oner, and not from private humanity on the one hand, or re&s;entment on the other, to lean either way. As to the common law principles of vicinage, there are advantages and the&s;e are di&s;advantages attending it. The advantages are, that the parties are known by, and know their jurors and witne&s;&s;es, that their characters may be viewed, and the mo&s;t impartial ju&s;tice done. But if nearly one whole county has been in a &s;tate of in&s;urrection, can it be &s;aid that a fair trial can be had there? We may at lea&s;t pre&s;ume it could not, becau&s;e the pre|&s;ident of the United States ordered a military force there, to enforce the execution of the laws. It was by this military force that the pri|&s;oners are now convened in this city, and I have rea&s;on to believe from the opinion and knowledge of the judge with whom I now act, that it would be exceeding improper to hold the trials there. It was hinted that troops are &s;till there, and they could promote the execution of ju&s;tice; but what &s;ort of ju&s;tice is that of the &s;word? If they would operate at all it would be by intimidation, and this would be to the prejudice of the pri&s;oner, and in no re&s;pect in his favour. This con|&s;ideration alone in my opinion would make it "manife&s;tly inconvenient." for a trial to be held there. With re&s;pect to the principles of common law, the gentlemen well know that the <HI>venire</HI> may be changed, that is, that parts of the jury may be &s;ummoned from other counties. I do not know whether there is a power in the courts to change the <HI>venire</HI> in England in a criminal ca&s;e, but I know that in &s;ome difficult ca&s;es, where partiality was to be apprehended an act of parliament has been pa&s;&s;ed to remove the trial: this was done re&s;pecting the rebellion in Scotland, for the manife&s;t rea&s;on of partiality. This proves that we ought not to look to one &s;ide only, but to both, and then form our determination.
<PB N="10" REF="037104_0239_100D804E23E9CD48">
Upon the whole I am clearly of opinion that if the motion could be granted without running the ri&s;k of the&s;e uncertainties, but certain in|conveniences, it would not be expedient to grant the motion, and there|fore the trial mu&s;t go forward.</P>

<P>MR. DALLAS &s;aid it became his duty as advocate for the pri&s;oner, to lay before their honours the grounds on which they had moved for a new trial in the ca&s;e of their unfortunate client, in which he was &s;en|&s;ible &s;ome little violence mu&s;t be offered to <HI>his</HI> feelings in who&s;e be|half it was made, and particularly if judgment &s;hould at la&s;t be pro|nounced upon him; but whatever the event, it became their duty to pre|fer it, and he was certain that upon examination into the facts, they mu&s;t be ju&s;tified in producing them, as the event mu&s;t alter the deci&s;ion which had taken place. He was &s;atisfied that the court, without di|rect reference to authorities, would be inclined to li&s;ten to any thing that could be offered upon good grounds in favour of life, or the chance
<PB N="12" REF="037104_0241_100D8054E30CEA68">
of life. With this confidence, he relied on the favourable attention which would be paid by the court, and that the intervention of any trifling error in the proceeding, may not expo&s;e the defendant to the danger of a favourable deci&s;ion.</P>
<P>In making the motion, Mr. Lewis had laid before the court &s;ome affidavits in order to prove tint one of the Jurors, after he had been &s;ummoned to attend the trial did declare that the man &s;hould be con|victed: in addition to that circum&s;tance, the following rea&s;ons &s;hould have been a&s;&s;igned in favour of the motion:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That the mar&s;hal has, without any order or direction from the court or judges for that purpo&s;e, returned a greater number of jurors than he was by law authorized to do:</P>
<P>Secondly, That he returned them from &s;uch parts of the di&s;trict as he thought proper, and without the direction of the court or judges:</P>
<P>Thirdly, That the trial ought to have been held in the county where the offence was committed, except manife&s;t inconveniency &s;hould ap|pear, and it does rot appear from any part of the record of the court that any inconveniency did prevent it, for whatever were the acts of the court they ought to have been placed on the record, which not being done, is good ground for a motion.</P>
<P>JUDGE IREDELL, did not think that the Court were bound to a&s;&s;ign a rea&s;on for their judgment on the record of their proceedings, be&s;ides it was an high contempt at this time to call for the renewal of an ar|gument whereon a &s;olemn deci&s;ive opinion was delivered: he a&s;ked what part of the law required it: if it was at that time omitted, it was in the power of the court to order it now; or if they did not or|der the rea&s;ons to be in&s;erted, the mere deci&s;ion on the face of the re|cord was enough to make it authoritative.</P>
<P>MR. DALLAS &s;aid there was no intention of offering a contempt to the court, and if there honors would attend they would be convinced there was not.&mdash;The judiciary act 29th &s;ection p. 67, vol. 1, Contem|plates two things, fir&s;t, trial &s;hall be had in the proper county without great inconvenience &s;hould appear, but if it &s;hould &s;o appear to the court, then, &s;econdly, twelve petit jurors at lea&s;t &s;hall be &s;ummoned from the county. From this it appears that before the &s;econd branch of this clau&s;e can be executed, there mu&s;t be a determination upon the fir&s;t; it mu&s;t be evident that there are too great inconveniencies to ad|mit of the trial being held there, and then the &s;econd mu&s;t take place; and further that it mu&s;t be the act of the court to direct that twelve jurors &s;hall be &s;ummoned from the county. The court have great latitude in this di&s;cretion; they have power to take the whole &s;ixty from the county they plea&s;e, but not le&s;s than twelve; if therefore this di&s;cretion is given, and given to the court, it is not in the power of any mini&s;terial officer to exerci&s;e it without the direction of the court: they are to be returned as the "court &s;hall direct." "The&s;e words more particularly relate to another branch of the &s;ection, to wit: from what part of the di&s;trict from time to time the re&s;t &s;hall be called. The <HI>venire</HI> in this ca&s;e was made returnable on the 11th of April, this precept directs that the mar&s;hal &s;hall return a li&s;t of &s;ixty petit jurors, and twenty four grand jurors, who appear to be all returned from the
<PB N="13" REF="037104_0242_100D80566A9C3018">
county of Philadelphia. Your honors will ob&s;erve that the mar&s;hal has authority to &s;ummon not more than 60, nor le&s;s than 48. In this return he has &s;ummoned 60 from Philadelphia county, whereas twelve at lea&s;t ought to have been &s;ummoned from Northampton. The autho|rity of this <HI>venire</HI> then is at an end, for it cannot be pretended upon any authority or precedent, in a civil or criminal ca&s;e that a mar&s;hal or Sheriff has ever attempted to exerci&s;e &s;uch a power without a pre|cept in form, commanding him: and the award appearing upon the record. This <HI>venire</HI> is completely &s;atisfied, and all the authority given has been exerci&s;ed in the return of 60, and if he has returned more he mu&s;t &s;how authority for it. With re&s;pect to the we&s;tern in&s;urrection, Judges Patter&s;on and Peters did not adopt the &s;tate regulations with regard to the number of jurors, but any deviation from that mu&s;t be on the &s;ole authority of the court. 2 Dallas 341, 2. Mr. Patter&s;on was of opinion that the common law proceedings of the court of King's bench ought to guide their proceedings upon a que&s;tion of this nature, &s;ince the act of Congre&s;s &s;ays nothing about number, but refers to &s;tate pro|ceedings, which is guided by that common law. To &s;how the pro|ceedings of Kings bench, and to prove that the court alone had the direction of the <HI>venire</HI> Mr. Dallas quoted the following authorities: 4 Black&s;tone 344, 3 Black&s;tone 352 Cooks Littleton 155, or Keyling 16 2 Hales pleas 263.&mdash;be&s;ides he &s;aid the &s;ame &s;ection gave direction as to the manner of i&s;&s;uing writs of <HI>venire facias</HI> when returned by the <HI>court</HI> p. 68, <HI>to issue from the office of the Clerks of the COURT.</HI> It is there|fore incumbent on tho&s;e who vindicate the legality of the mar&s;hal's proceedings, to &s;how that he acted with authority, viz. from the clerk's office directed by the court. To &s;how what authority he had to &s;um|mon 89 jurors, when not more than 60 was u&s;ual; to &s;how his authority for &s;ummoning <HI>seventeen</HI> from Northampton and <HI>twelve</HI> from Bucks. If you take it as one return it is a return of 89 jurors upon a precept which directs no more than 60, if you take the &s;urplus number over 60 as a &s;eparate return, there is no authority at all for making it.</P>
<P>Mr. Dallas &s;aid he did not mean to controvert, for he re&s;pected the opinions of the Court, but re&s;pecting holding the trial in the county, he would refer to the 8th amendment to the con&s;titution, p. 456, vol. 3. in the&s;e words, "In all criminal ca&s;es the accu&s;ed &s;hall be entitled to a &s;peedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the &s;tate and di&s;|trict wherein the crime &s;hall have been committed, which di&s;trict &s;hall have been previou&s;ly a&s;certained by law." Then referring to the ju|diciary act, and finding it there declared that the offender &s;hould be tried in the proper county, the que&s;tion then is, whether this is not e&s;|tabli&s;hing a di&s;trict as it re&s;pects capital crimes, except "manife&s;t in|convenience" prevent. If &s;o, the place where the court is now &s;itting is to be con&s;idered a foreign county, now where by <HI>certiorari</HI> an indict|ment is removed in the king's bench, and where the jurors are to come from a foreign county, then time mu&s;t be allowed for the precept to i&s;&s;ue, which mu&s;t be in the rule of the record, 2 Hawk. c. 27, &s;ec. 1. This court is &s;itting in the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, and the juri&s;diction of the court is co-exten&s;ive with it, and &s;o is King's bench with the whole nation of England: the proce&s;s of this court may be &s;ent into
<PB N="14" REF="037104_0243_100D80582516F6F0">
any county in the &s;tate, &s;o may that of King's bench to any county in England, 4 Hawk. c. 41, p. 376&mdash;2 Hales pleas 260&mdash;4 Hawk. b. 2, c. 27, p. 171. Douglas 590. In the pre&s;ent precept there does not appear to be a return of 89 jurors authori&s;ed, but that 89 have been returned: the &s;upplementary return was made by the mar&s;hal without any act of the court, and with any <HI>venire</HI> being duly i&s;&s;ued, or any a|ward to &s;ummon this jury to try the pri&s;oner. <HI>Seven</HI> of the per&s;ons who were on the li&s;t impannelled to try John Fries, and who have gi|ven vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dict, are not at all on the li&s;t &s;ummoned for the trial: how came tho&s;e &s;even per&s;ons then on this trial, re&s;pecting whom no <HI>venire</HI> was i&s;&s;ued? They were not called to attend by any proce&s;s of the Court! This was not the ca&s;e in the we&s;tern in&s;urrection, for then, though a greater number was &s;ummoned, it was upon the &s;olemn deci|&s;ion of the Court, and by their order that the venire was i&s;&s;ued. [he read the venire then i&s;&s;ued] In that proceeding every thing is re|gular: the mar&s;hal receives expre&s;s orders to &s;ummon 12 jurors from Allegany, &amp;c. but where are &s;imilar directions in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e? 4 Black&s;tone 369&mdash;4 Hawk. c. 31, &s;ect. 4. p. 240. ibid c. 27, &s;ect. 104, p. 175, are authorities to explain what is mi&s;-trial, and are a ju&s;|tification of the pre&s;ent application for a new trial. Hence it appears that a mi&s;-return of jurors is &s;uch an error, if they actually pa&s;s, as to make a mi&s;-trial, and the verdict is of cour&s;e void. In this ca&s;e 60 is returned upon a &s;chedule with the names annexed, and on another &s;chedule a return by the mar&s;hal of 17 from Northampton county, and 12 from Bucks, to which the mar&s;hal &s;igns his name, but no proce&s;s was i&s;&s;ued for the&s;e &s;upplementary 29 names, and it is clear from the in&s;trument that 60 compleated the return, only five of whom were on the trial of the pri&s;oner, and the other &s;even had no right to try him, being drawn from a li&s;t which no proceeding had authorized. Where there has been no proce&s;s, no trial can proceed. Law of Errors, p. 65. We &s;ee what is the effect of a per&s;on intruding him&s;elf into the jury, who has not been lawfully &s;ummoned, 4 Hawk. c. 25, p. 16&mdash;the verdict is void, ibid. p. 17. This will be granted. Mr. Dallas here recapitulated the objections he had &s;tated, and added that merely the appearance of the jurors, nor their having been &s;worn, or having given verdict were objections &s;ufficient to overturn the motion.</P>
<P>He next made a few ob&s;ervations on the conduct of the juror, which he &s;aid was not merely an expre&s;&s;ion of opinion, but a previous determination, and an expre&s;&s;ion of fear if the pri&s;oner &s;hould be ac|quitted, &s;o that it was impo&s;&s;ible to he&s;itate that, if this was true, the juror did not give verdict upon evidence, but was influenced by a previ|ous bias, and prejudiced determination: his going into the box with this partial mind, deprived the pri&s;oner of that chance which the law deter|mines he &s;hall have. It is nece&s;&s;ary that every jury &s;hould enter this box free from malice; but it was not &s;o: this juror laboured under particular impre&s;&s;ions, unfavourable to John Fries, becau&s;e he concei|ved he had been the leader of, and brought on this di&s;turbance, and therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to be hung: this will be proved to have been more than once the language of the juror, and that he indulged him&s;elf in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> expre&s;&s;ions. After running from place to place, influenced by a
<PB N="15" REF="037104_0244_100D8059B4F63E28">
vindictive &s;pirit of prejudice, to expre&s;s his de&s;ires, can it be contend|ed that he was capable of deciding on the guilt or innocence of the pri&s;oner, by the weight of the te&s;timony only? There cannot be found a &s;tronger ca&s;e in the books. It is not nece&s;&s;ary or right to go into the te&s;timony, or any of the circum&s;tances of the crime of the pri&s;oner, to &s;ee whether the verdict was right or wrong; but it is nece&s;&s;ary to view the determination of this juror, who wi&s;hed them all hanged, and particularized Fries, Fir&s;t, his words were, "we will hang them all: then he &s;aid, "I my&s;elf &s;hall be in danger, unle&s;s we do hang them all." This is not merely an opinion generally expre&s;&s;ed, but the lan|guage of de&s;ign to convict at all events. If eleven out of twelve ju|rors had been of opinion that an acquittal &s;hould take place, and this individual &s;uppo&s;ing he was in danger had declared this opinion, and pointed out his view of the probable con&s;equences, would not the voice of the eleven be changed to guard again&s;t this danger? 4 Hawkins, c. 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, &s;ec. 28. p. 399, &s;upports the doctrine generally, that if a juror <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> declared his opinion before hand, that the party is guilty, or will be hanged, or the like, it is good cau&s;e of challenge: but if from his knowledge of the ca&s;e, and not from <HI>ill-will</HI> to the party, he has only declared his opinion, it is no cau&s;e of challenge. But even re&s;ent|ment has not the influence upon a man's conduct which &s;elf-pre&s;erva|tion has: ill-will is not the only ground of challenge; intere&s;t is as much &s;o: if a man had laid a wager another would be hung, this is not ill-will, but would viciate the juror. Therefore we mu&s;t conclude that <HI>"ill-will"</HI> in the above authority, is put merely as an in&s;tance. Whether the&s;e words were &s;poken in warmth or not, is immaterial; for it would be no alleviation; it is impo&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould have been expre&s;&s;ed without ill-will; and therefore the man is not impar|tially qualified to pa&s;s upon the life or death of the pri&s;oner. Salkeld 645 and 11 Modern 118. Upon the general ground of what could be with propriety called mi&s;conduct in the per&s;on &s;ummoned to di&s;charge the duty of a juror with impartiality, he ob&s;erved there could be no doubt upon the propriety of their a&s;king a new trial, nor upon the ju&s;|tice of one being granted.</P>
<P>MR. LEWIS mentioned 5 Bacon, 251&mdash;2 (old edition) and 4 Black|&s;tone 354&mdash;5, in order to &s;how, that in criminal ca&s;es there &s;hould be no new trial, unle&s;s it &s;hould appear that the former trial had been at|tended with fraud, &amp;c. and that a new trial in tho&s;e ca&s;es might be granted after conviction, it Modern, 119. 5 Bacon, 243, and 3 ibid, 258 (old edition.)

The direction re|&s;pecting the <HI>venire,</HI> he &s;aid, was entru&s;ted to the law and not to the mar&s;hal, and by that direction was exerci&s;ed by the judges in 1795, and if that was neglected, it was not legally executed.

direction of the law in re&s;pect to the <HI>venire,</HI> it was good cau&s;e for a new trial.</P>
<P>MR. SITGREAVES &s;aid he did not think it nece&s;&s;ary to controvert the po&s;ition which had been advanced by the gentlemen on the other &s;ide: that the court have full power to order a new trial after con|viction in certain criminal ca&s;es, as well as civil under certain circum|&s;tances; but notwith&s;tanding the authority of the court to grant new trials was a&s;certained in &s;ome of the books, yet it would appear that this power had never been exerci&s;ed in any capital ca&s;e; no &s;uch ca&s;e had been referred to, and he believed could not be found; he imagined the rea&s;on why it could not, was, although courts had the full power, yet the peculiar &s;olemnity of a trial for a capital offence, and the great caution which was u&s;ed to guard the &s;ecurity of the pri&s;oner again&s;t improper bias, or wrong proceeding that may re&s;pect his guilt or inno|cence, with &s;ufficient mounds to prevent intru&s;ion, and therefore con|viction in &s;uch a ca&s;e had not yet been &s;et a&s;ide. With re&s;pect to the qualification of a juror, objections as to the array or to the poll ought to be received by a court with uniform caution, after trial and verdict is pa&s;&s;ed, becau&s;e there is &s;o full and ample opportunities given to the pri&s;oner to deliberately enquire and make a good choice: the whole pannel which are &s;ummoned, mu&s;t be given to the pri&s;oner; a certain time mu&s;t be allowed before he can be called upon to an&s;wer the charge, &s;ufficient for him to enquire the character, intere&s;t, affec|tion, or partiality of the men: having this time and opportunity, &s;o carefully &s;ecured to him by po&s;itive in&s;titutions of law, it is not to be wondered that objections afterwards &s;hould be cautiou&s;ly received by the courts. After having the&s;e opportunities for examination, the law gives power to the pri&s;oner to challenge 35 jurors arbitrarily, or without a&s;&s;igning a rea&s;on, and after that as many more as he can a&s;&s;ign ju&s;t cau&s;e of objection to, and they will al&s;o be &s;et a&s;ide if his objection is well founded. To depart from this general view, and make the particular application, which is by no means irrelevant in a que&s;tion of this nature, it is ob&s;ervable that the pri&s;oner has actually had more than common power to &s;elect a jury to his mind: of this whole li&s;t 33 did not appear, and of the number that remained the pri&s;oner chal|lenged 35, &s;o that he had 68 entirely in his power as much as though all had been pre&s;ent, and he had challenged 68. With re&s;pect to Mr. Rhoad the juror, there is &s;omething worthy of remark: When Mr. Rhoad came to be called, and there was &s;ome difficulty &s;ugge&s;ted as to his knowledge of the English language, although the court and pro&s;ecuting council &s;aw the force of the objection, he was retained at the in&s;tance of the council for the pri&s;oner, becau&s;e they had exhau&s;ted all their challenges, and they did not know that the next would be &s;o agreeable.</P>
<P>MR. SITGREAVES next &s;tated to the court what he thought to be the unque&s;tionable principles of law on the point in que&s;tion.&mdash;If a mo|tion for a new trial is received in a court for a criminal cau&s;e, it is under the &s;ame rule and circum&s;tances as for a civil cau&s;e, and in both depends on the <HI>discretion</HI> of the court, and that di&s;cretion ought to be governed, not by any preci&s;e &s;et of rules now known in law, but in any
<PB N="17" REF="037104_0246_100D8060DD15B978">
way that will be&s;t perpetuate ju&s;tice, except there &s;hould appear a mandatory, imperative rule. If the law &s;ays that upon conviction of a certain crime, a certain puni&s;hment &s;hall en&s;ue: this is peremptory, and the court have no power to depart from ordering that puni&s;hment. Wherever a di&s;cretion it left, it is meant that the court may u&s;e that di&s;cretion, according as the nature of the ca&s;e may require, and this is left in the con&s;cience and mind of the court alone, agreeable to cir|cum&s;tances which grow out of the ju&s;tice applying to the particular ca&s;e. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e therefore, the court are not to be governed by any &s;et of preci&s;e rules, but by an opinion of what will be&s;t per|petuate <HI>public justice.</HI> To be &s;ure it is a rule, that a new trial &s;hall be granted where a verdict is given again&s;t evidence, but even then it has been frequently refu&s;ed, where they &s;ee the ca&s;e it plain. In civil cau&s;es it has been refu&s;ed, when not to the intere&s;t of ju&s;tice to grant it. 2 Burrows, 936.</P>
<P>JUDGE IREDELL &s;aid he had not di&s;covered any <HI>dictu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> which di&s;tingui&s;hed civil from criminal cau&s;es, &s;o that equal ju&s;tice ought not to be admini&s;tered; but if either, &s;urely a criminal ca&s;e called mo&s;t &s;trongly for ju&s;tice: it would never do to apply ca&s;ts &s;o far, as to &s;ay, that if one man upon a jury was di&s;covered not to be fully impartial, a new trial &s;hould not be granted, when a man's life was at &s;take.</P>
<P>JUDGE PETERS &s;aid he always under&s;tood, that the power of granting a new trial, was in the di&s;cretion of the court; and that its opinion ought not to be turned by any vagaries, which &s;hould be pre|&s;ented, but be governed by a reference to legal di&s;cretion; but at the &s;ame time, he could not &s;ay that the court ought to throw entirely out of their view, all the evidence which had been given in the trial, and every thing that had been done. If in the &s;cale of ju&s;tice, there &s;hould appear to be any error, and the ca&s;e is any way doubtful, then the court will take advantage of a tri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le, in order to grant a new trial, but where the court has been fully convinced that the verdict is right, then the evidence ought to have &s;ome weight, as well at the law.</P>
<P>MR. DALLAS ob&s;erved, that the motion was not in any regard to evidence, if &s;o, the weight of evidence mu&s;t be con&s;idered; but it was alone on the point of law, totally independent of evidence.</P>
<P>MR. SITGREAVES contended, that where a trial was nece&s;&s;ary for the purpo&s;es of ju&s;tice, it re&s;ted between the judge and his con&s;cience, and he was not to be governed by any preci&s;e &s;tate of facts here or there: if, as is unque&s;tionably the ca&s;e on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, a trial has been held, which for the patience of inve&s;tigation given to it by the court and jury, has &s;carcely had its equal in this, or my other country; where the pri&s;oner has had every indulgence, and every ca|pacity of talents, which this &s;tate can afford, to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">i&s;t him in his de|fence; if after all this, a conviction has been the re&s;ult of this minute and laborious examination, it will at lea&s;t be allowed, that the objec|tion which &s;hould have the ultimate effect of &s;etting a&s;ide a deci&s;ion and inve&s;tigation &s;o &s;olemnly and deliberately taken, &s;hould be ground|ed upon no &s;light matter, but that the rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> compleatly
<PB N="18" REF="037104_0247_100D8062D15E6558">
authenticated, &s;o as not to leave a doubt, or the lea&s;t ambiguity. If the facts related in the affidavits, had been known to the pri&s;oner, and mentioned when the juror came for his array, undoubtedly, the legal inve&s;tigation would haw taken place, and a &s;olemn deci&s;ion pa&s;&s;ed thereon, which if true, would have been to di&s;qualify the juror. Mr. S. explained the different modes of challenge, and proceeded to que&s;tion the relation of the affidavits&mdash;that the&s;e were words, &s;aid to be &s;poken a con&s;iderable time before the trial, "&s;ome days:" the trial had been nine days before the court, and it was probable, this declaration mu&s;t have been made fifteen days at lea&s;t, that this impor|tant and often repeated conver&s;ation &s;hould re&s;t all this time in the minds of the witne&s;&s;es, without a di&s;clo&s;ure, was very extraordinary, particularly &s;o, when it was con&s;idered that they attended the court every day, and at la&s;t the affidavits re&s;ted on the memory of the wit|ne&s;&s;es, which mu&s;t be very liable to mi&s;-apprehen&s;ion and error. This is good rea&s;on for the objection, that the application is too late, and ought, in a matter of &s;o much importance, to have been mentioned &s;ooner, if in the knowledge of &s;o many people, at &s;uch repeated con|ver&s;ations as the gentlemen conceived.</P>
<P>Mr. Sitgreaves was proceeding here to read a written declaration of Mr. Rhoad (the juror) as to the circum&s;tances of the conver&s;ation, which as it was not &s;worn to, was objected by the pri&s;oner's coun&s;el; the juror was at length &s;worn, and the depo&s;ition was read to the court. Mr. Sitgreaves &s;aid he read this, to &s;how how ea&s;y it was to mi&s;apprehend not only the meaning of words, but the words them|&s;elves. Another thing to be ob&s;erved was, two of the witne&s;&s;es them|&s;elves at that moment, were pri&s;oners out upon bail, under indictment for mi&s;demeanor, and therefore the affidavit of &s;o re&s;pectable a citizen as the juror, denying the fact, left a &s;erious doubt as to the truth of the others' depo&s;itions, but more as to the probability of mi&s;take in the relation. Mr. S. then went into a compari&s;on of the affidavits, which he contended were very di&s;&s;imilar, and had much the appear|ance of wrong &s;tatement. Whatever may be the difference of opi|nions, as to the di&s;cretion of the court, when they are fully &s;atisfied that the crime is well a&s;certained, both as to law and evidence, yet it would not be doubted as the unque&s;tionable right of the court, to in&s;titute the mo&s;t &s;evere &s;crutiny in a matter which endangers the whole of the former proceedings; the former proceeding which mu&s;t be valid, unle&s;s the mo&s;t unequivocal te&s;timony &s;hall intervene to change it.</P>
<P>Mr. Sitgreaves &s;aid the conver&s;ation was of a general nature, and not to the pri&s;oner in particular, agreeable to the affidavits generally; it &s;poke of the general effects of the in&s;urrection in that country: in|deed it was not to be expected in a matter of &s;uch public concern as that unhappy affair, but every man would expre&s;s his opinion, and particularly tho&s;e who re&s;ided on the &s;pot; therefore it could not evince any prejudice, and con&s;equently not be lawful challenge to the juror. He referred to 3 Bacon new edition Letter E &s;ection 12. One affi|davit only particularized Fries; and yet it appeared from Mr. Rhoad's depo&s;ition to relate to one conver&s;ation only, therefore it was evi|dent
<PB N="19" REF="037104_0248_100D806461C01360">
that the relations differed, and were of cour&s;e of a &s;u&s;picious nature. If a man draws a deduction from what he has heard, or from his own knowledge of an event, and not from "ill will," it is no proof of prejudice or partiality, he is &s;till "indifferent" and open to impre&s;|&s;ion: there mu&s;t be an expre&s;&s;ion of malice, of determination, to a particular ca&s;e, and in a particular way.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t cau&s;e of challenge may be, if one of the grand jury is impan|nelled on the petit jury, becau&s;e he may be &s;aid to have already "pa&s;|&s;ed upon the ca&s;e in i&s;&s;ue" 2 Hawk. 29. C 43. Where an action is dependant between a juror and defendant, it is then challenge to the favor, Viner 21 title <HI>juries</HI> h. d. Cook Littleton 157 d. Nothing that is merely an expre&s;&s;ion of opinion is cau&s;e of challenge: nothing but what flows from a malicious heart again&s;t the pri&s;oner in particular; all the ca&s;es &s;how the di&s;tinction, and there is not a &s;ingle ca&s;e in which the declaration of a juror has been made cau&s;e of challenge but to the favor, in which ca&s;e triers are appointed by the court to examine whether this predi&s;po&s;ition does or does not appear. The pre&s;ent ca&s;e therefore is not cau&s;e of particular challenge, but of challenge to the favor, which was not made in time. Mr. Sitgreaves then referred the court to &s;ome authorities 2 Rolls abridgment 657&mdash;21 Viner title trial 266 and 272&mdash;1 Salkel 153 and one which occurred in this &s;tate when one Ann Clifton, was convicted for murder, and one of the jur|rors had made declaration before he was &s;worn re&s;pecting the guilt of the pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>JUDGE PETERS &s;aid that he had given the mar&s;hal directions to &s;ummon jurors from Bucks and Northampton: he was not certain whether it was given in writing or verbally, but left it &s;hould not have been in writing he now gave it to the prothonotary of the court. At the fir&s;t appearance of it, he did not know whether it amounted to trea&s;on, and therefore he thought particular directions not nece&s;&s;ary, but afterwards, finding it more &s;erious, he gave the directions which had guided the mar&s;hal.</P>
<P>MR. RAWLE thought it ea&s;y to prove that the mar&s;hal was fully authorized to &s;ummon from what part of the &s;tate he plea&s;ed, unle&s;s the court interfered by a &s;pecial direction, and then he was bound to obey the mandate. The mar&s;hal no doubt under&s;tood that he was to &s;ummon from the &s;tate at large, conformable to the directions of the law. With re&s;pect to the we&s;tern in&s;urrection, the fiat of the court was obtained, but it was not &s;o in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. Mr. Rawle, he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e appealed to the prothonotary to know whether any in&s;tance of a &s;pecial direction of the court re&s;pecting <HI>venire</HI> had occurred &s;ince that period in any capital ca&s;e. Mr. Caldwell an&s;wered there <HI>had not.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. RAWLE went on to mention the progre&s;s which had been made, and the time and opportunities of which the pri&s;oner might have availed him&s;elf, but the&s;e he had neglected, and at this period, he came forward by his coun&s;el to challenge the array! Challenge, he ob&s;erved, was of two kinds, the poll and the array; if challenge was made to the poll, and the trial went on, challenge to the array could not be made, becau&s;e exception was before made, but he thought it was clear the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> was pa&s;&s;ed at which he might hive availed him&s;elf of the chal|lenge
<PB N="20" REF="037104_0249_100D806628063B28">
to the array. It was contended that the mar&s;hal had not made a proper return to the <HI>venire,</HI> but authority had not been produced to prove the point, yet authority could be found to prove that after the poll bad pa&s;&s;ed, even before the trial, the array could not be challenged, becau&s;e that was pa&s;&s;ed too, but to what a much greater length had the pre&s;ent objection been delayed? After having taken the chance of the verdict, and finding it unfavorable, then to &s;ay it was irregular, and for a rea&s;on which might have appeared &s;ooner, he quoted 12 Mod. 567 and 584. 2 Lord Raymond 84, refering to the time when excep|tion may be made.</P>
<P>Farther, after all the chances which a pri&s;oner could have, and com|plaints made of irregularity as to the venire, the objection was far|ther extended to a man who was &s;ummoned from the very county where the crime was tran&s;acted! Upon this man the pri&s;oner was willing to put him&s;elf for trial, rather than one he did not know. See Danver's abridge. 354, 5 and 7. With re&s;pect to the number returned. Mr. Rawle referred to Crookjames 467. 2 trials per page 599. 21 &s;tate trials, 707. There might be more than 60 returned; in regard to the we&s;tern in&s;urrection he &s;aid there were 108 &s;ummoned. The words of the v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ire directing the mar&s;hal are, that he <HI>cause to come to the court,</HI> &s;o many a certain day; it is therefore proper that a certain num|ber &s;hould attend, and to en&s;ure the number nece&s;&s;ary to meet the challenge, the mar&s;hal u&s;ually &s;ummons a greater number than are mentioned, but if a greater number do attend, then the &s;uper-numera|ry are &s;tricken off. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e the number in the venire was exceeded by 29, and yet 38 le&s;s attended at any one time than were &s;ummoned, the pri&s;oner had been tried by one of the&s;e 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;even of whom were from his own neighborhood, and men in whom he thought he could place his life with &s;afety. In order to confine the number within &s;ome bounds &s;o as not to exceed rea&s;on in ca&s;e a mar&s;hal or &s;heriff could be found to make that improper u&s;e of his power, and take the citizens from their bu&s;ine&s;s or their homes unnece&s;&s;arily, an officer &s;o offending can be pro&s;ecuted for mi&s;demeanor, but this was not the ca&s;e. Where there is more than a &s;ufficient number &s;um|moned for the purpo&s;e of trying a civil cau&s;e, which in Penn&s;ylvania is confined to 48, and more than that number &s;hould attend, and one of them &s;worn on the trial is taken from tho&s;e over the 48 that at|tend, then no doubt it would be mi&s;trial, becau&s;e the &s;ummons was unlawful; &s;o in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, if one of the jurors had been of the 48 over the number 60, had more than 60 attended it would have been a mi&s;trial, becau&s;e the venire ordered the mar&s;hal to cau&s;e but 60 to appear, (but that objection even would have been in&s;ufficient at this &s;tage of the trial) and more he had no right to bring.</P>
<P>As to the propriety of &s;ummoning 12 from Bucks and 17 from Northampton, there appears to be no wanton exerci&s;e of power in the mar&s;hal, becau&s;e he acted under the authority of the judge of this court. The gentlemen could not &s;how an authority which made it nece&s;&s;ary for the mar&s;hal to have a certificate to empower him to do this, and if it was nece&s;&s;ary, the certificate of the judge appearing upon the record would make it valid. But even if had not receiv|ed
<PB N="21" REF="037104_0250_100D806A1F3A6E38">
the authority of the judge, the act of Congre&s;s would have been a &s;ufficient warrant for his conduct. P. 67 vol. 1. twelve at lea&s;t are to be &s;ummoned from that county, and 17 are &s;ummoned. The act of &s;um|moning is properly the bu&s;ine&s;s of the mar&s;hal, if he has official notice, <HI>in any shape,</HI> that &s;uch a trial for a capital offence is coming forward, which would entitle the pri&s;oner to be tried by twelve jurors from the proper county if he makes the provi&s;ion which the law requires, he has ab&s;olutely and completely acquitted his office, as well technically as formally. The return which has been produced embraces the whole number of 89, &s;ixty of whom are of the county of Philadelphia, and if there is any technical alteration in the form nece&s;&s;ary to give it legal preci&s;ion and effect, it is now in time to alter it, but there is none ne|ce&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Mr. RAWLE &s;aid he con&s;idered this proceeding as having received the full &s;anction of the court, in the certificate given by the judge. Fir&s;t becau&s;e no oppo&s;ition had been made to it, and &s;econdly becau&s;e (the whole number not having appeared) it was not excepted to at that time. The li&s;t out of which the &s;even jurors from the country were taken, he called a &s;upplementary li&s;t, which completed the for|mer li&s;t, and though not annexed to that pannel was connected with it, filled up and made a part of it, on which an award was entered. The ca&s;es referred to had re&s;pect to a foreign country, but in a di&s;|trict, one county was not foreign to another, and therefore Bucks, Northampton and Philadelphia, &s;tood in one exact &s;ituation. 2 Hawk C. 41. B. 2. Dyer 118.</P>
<P>Mr. RAWLE concluded by &s;aying that he looked upon all the pro|ceedings in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e as perfectly regular and compleat, to which no exception could ju&s;tly be taken by the pri&s;oner, and he hoped the effort would mi&s;carry, &s;ince every means had been u&s;ed in the defence during the long and patient inve&s;tigation which had taken place, and after a vredict had been &s;o &s;olemnly pronounced by men whom the pri|&s;oner had &s;uch a fair means of chu&s;ing to an&s;wer his be&s;t purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The attorney general, and council agreed, and the court ordered that the deponents &s;hould give te&s;timony, and be cro&s;s examined in court, on each &s;ide. Al&s;o that the witne&s;&s;es &s;hould be examined &s;eparately, and kept out of the court, &s;o as not to hear the evidence given by each other.</P>

<P>JACOB ARNOT junior had been acquainted with Mr. Rhoad &s;ome years, and believed him to be a man of unblemi&s;hed character, as good as any in that country.</P>
<P>MR. SITGREAVES &s;aid he would not have troubled the court again, upon this que&s;tion, had circum&s;tances re&s;ted as they were before the evidence, but upon inve&s;tigation palpable differences would be di&s;cover|ed between the affidavits and the verbal relations, not only of the de|ponents with them&s;elves, but which other. He then analized and compared the affidavits of Mayer, Heberly and Hartman, which he only recommended to the examination of the court, and he thought the difference mu&s;t appear &s;o e&s;&s;ential as to give a &s;erious doubt of the accuracy or truth of either, while the character of Mr. Rhoad was unimpeachable.</P>
<P>MR. LEWIS &s;aid if any trifling difference appeared in the affida|vits from the relation, it was ea&s;ily accounted for in the manner the affidavits were taken: tho&s;e of Heberly and Hartman, were taken in his office, and interpreted by a German, from whom he had very great difficulty to collect the meaning in Engli&s;h. Only one of the&s;e affi|davits were taken by him&s;elf, the other by Mr. Ewing, a young gen|tleman, &s;tudent in his office [Mr. Ewing corroborated the fact: "that he could not under&s;tand what the interpreter &s;aid."]</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="037104_0259_100D807EDF065648">
MR. LEWIS then mentioned the grounds upon which the rule to &s;how cau&s;e had been granted; whether either, or all of the&s;e grounds had weight in them, he would not undertake to a&s;&s;ert; but certain it was, that it was the duty of the pri&s;oner's coun&s;el to lay them before the court, and wait the event, which if favourable, would cau&s;e a new trial: if not, they &s;hould be &s;atisfied with having di&s;charged their duty; in either ca&s;e, they &s;hould cheerfully &s;ubmit to the opinion of the court; and he was &s;orry to &s;ee that the la&s;t que&s;tion, to wit, That the trial ought to have been held in the proper county, had given any di&s;compo&s;ure the court: he then explained the rea&s;on, to &s;how the court that it was not agitated out of any di&s;re&s;pect to their former deci&s;ion, which was that "manife&s;t inconvenience" did prevent the trial being held there, but this did not appear on the record. In cri|minal pro&s;ecutions, and e&s;pecially capital ca&s;es, it was u&s;ual for the pri&s;oner's coun&s;el to avail them&s;elves of every &s;lip and inaccuracy, and therefore he was excu&s;eable in the pre&s;ent. He quoted 4 Bur|rows, 252.</P>
<P>It was common for the court to err, and in &s;uch a ca&s;e, he con&s;i|dered him&s;elf in duty bound to point it out to them, and he was &s;atisfied if that error was of con&s;equence enough, the court would grant a rule thereupon, and thus retract from their former opinion, which they were fully authori&s;ed to do. He referred to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Black&s;tone 391&mdash;1 Burrows, 393.</P>
<P>MR. LEWIS then went on to point out the propriety of granting a new trial in criminal as well as in civil ca&s;es, although the pro&s;ecu|ting coun&s;el, had enforced the want of precedent, as a rea&s;on again&s;t it; indeed he &s;aid it was evidently of more con&s;equence, and there|fore he &s;uppo&s;ed it had been the more &s;trongly oppo&s;ed: a man's life and his fame was of more value than a part of his property, and he had no doubt that, whatever might have been the verdict, the court would go as far in granting it. It was admitted that the court had the power, if it had the power, there was no doubt but the honorable judges would exerci&s;e it according to their conviction.</P>
<P>Mr. LEWIS &s;aid the council for the pri&s;oner did not come forward to prove that the verdict was given again&s;t evidence, but to in&s;i&s;t that the pri&s;oner had been tried by eleven jurors only, for the other &s;tood indifferent as he &s;tood un&s;worn, they went further&mdash;they went to prove that there was an e&s;&s;ential error in the pannel, and thus the pri&s;oner was bereft of tho&s;e benefits, to which the law entitled him. If we prove this, &s;aid he, we do not addre&s;s our&s;elves to the di&s;cretion of your honors; it is not a matter of will, it is a matter of ju&s;tice, to which we are entitled. As it re&s;pects the evidence, you are not at all to con&s;ider its weight: the evidence may be clear, and yet the verdict may be wrong given, becau&s;e of the incompetency of the ju|rors. The gentlemen have &s;aid the period for application is pa&s;t&mdash;it is too late,&mdash;but with all their talents and indu&s;trious re&s;earches, tho&s;e learned gentlemen have not been able to produce a &s;ingle au|thority to &s;upport the doctrine that it is too late; after conviction, or even after condemnation, the court have authority to order a new trial; no time is &s;pecified to limit the di&s;cretion, if the rea&s;ons are
<PB N="31" REF="037104_0260_100D8080797A2450">
good. If the law has not di&s;tingui&s;hed the period, tho&s;e gentlemen are certainly unwarranted in &s;aying it is too late. 2 Strange, 968, is a ca&s;e where an argument was held on a plea for new trial, but not a &s;ingle argument is u&s;ed, that a new trial could not be held on capital ca&s;es: that &s;eems to be taken for granted.</P>
<P>It was argued again&s;t a new trial, in capital ca&s;es, that the court proceeded more deliberately, and more cautiou&s;ly, and becau&s;e the pri&s;oner was allowed a challenge of his jury. The argument amounts to this: becau&s;e the law requires more caution, and gives the pri&s;oner more advantages where his life is at &s;take, for that rea&s;on, he &s;hould have le&s;s advantage and le&s;s indulgence, or in other words, becau&s;e the benignity of the law allowed more benefits in the awful event of life or death; therefore in another point, e&s;&s;ential to the pri&s;oner, he &s;hould be bereft of an advantage, enjoyed by one indicted for an a&s;|&s;ault, or in a common civil cau&s;e. It may be argued, that the bene|volence of the executive, may extend mercy to the pri&s;oner, becau&s;e of any irregularity in evidence or proceeding, but this will not &s;atisfy the law; it is an hazard at be&s;t, while the law gives him the certain advantage of a new trial. The power and right of granting a new trial in &s;ome ca&s;es, is admitted; now if any of the witne&s;&s;es or jurors could be proved to have perjured them&s;elves, the evidence being fir&s;t given, and the verdict pronounced; this, it will be allowed, would have weight to grant a now trial; but the ca&s;e before the court, goes as far, if not farther; and if there &s;hould appear an extreme error in &s;ummoning, the jury, or that one of the jurors had di&s;qualified him|&s;elf from wearing the characteri&s;tics of an unbia&s;&s;ed man, then it mu&s;t equally appear, that there has been an infringement of a legal right, &s;ufficient to lay the foundation of a &s;econd hearing.</P>
<P>Another doctrine that was in&s;i&s;ted on was, that it was di&s;cretionary in the court; that where they were &s;atisfied with a verdict, although again&s;t evidence, no new trial ought to be granted: there may be in|&s;tances of a civil nature, in which that doctrine will be allowable, but they differ materially from the one now before the court, and therefore will not apply: that application may go to the favor of the court, where they &s;ee the evidence &s;trong, but no favor can be exer|ci&s;ed, nor is any a&s;ked in this ca&s;e; we only appeal to the ju&s;tice of the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>It was &s;aid by one of the gentlemen, that this juror's declaring his &s;entiments, was only cau&s;e of challenge to the favor, for which triers ought to have been appointed, and the qualification or di&s;qualification of the juror been determined by them, but for which it was now too late. Mr. Lewis denied the po&s;ition. He had already proved, both on his own declaration, and by the evidence, that it did not come to their knowledge, until after the verdict was given, and therefore they came forward as &s;oon as they were obliged: this was allowed a &s;uf|ficient excu&s;e in Salkeld 645, and 11 Modern 119, and therefore the objection was unimportant. The witne&s;&s;es could not inform John Fries, for he was in gaol; he could not know it, until ye&s;terday morn|ing when the motion was made in court, for the witne&s;&s;es had no knowledge of each other, &s;o as to be able to communicate it. 3 Bacon
<PB N="32" REF="037104_0261_100D808263275FD8">
258&mdash;9, &s;ays, that <Q>it is particular cau&s;e of challenge, if a juror has declared his opinion touching the matter.</Q> In cau&s;es of particular challenge, the court is to inquire into the truth of the fact, and no triers are to be called, and if they find the cau&s;e a true one, they are not to judge, nor to be left to di&s;cretion, but, <HI>they must try the issue again.</HI> This is the doctrine of ancient law and u&s;age, 266 Bacon. Then all the argument about triers is out of the que&s;tion, the que&s;tion is, whether the juror &s;tood indifferent, or whether he was under the influence of bias, and a prejudiced mind: the law compels the i&s;&s;ue to &s;teer clear of friends or enemies: no partiality whatever is to pre|dominate; but can any man in the world, &s;ay that Rhoad's mind was free from prejudice, when he took opportunities to make &s;uch declara|tions?</P>
<P>MR. LEWIS then went into an examination of the evidence and depo&s;itions. Now &s;uppo&s;e the court to believe the fact nearly as &s;tated by the evidence, Mr. L. a&s;ked, whether it was po&s;&s;ible, con&s;i&s;tent with law or ju&s;tice, to believe that a ju&s;t verdict was given, or that any man ought to &s;uffer under &s;uch a verdict? Suppo&s;e the whole twelve to have made &s;imilar declarations, it would require no argument to convince the unbia&s;&s;ed that the con&s;equence mu&s;t be fatal.</P>
<P>It has been attempted to be proved, that even &s;uch a declaration was no ground of challenge, if it was not made from malice; but what is the meaning of an independent man? It means a man who &s;tands on the high ground of ju&s;tice and impartiality, and is not warped by prejudice, nor warmed by re&s;entment&mdash;quite free from intere&s;t in the i&s;&s;ue: al&s;o a man who&s;e judgment has not been made up in favor of either the one party or the other, for if it has, though he may be an hone&s;t and well meaning man, it is not likely that his mind would be freely given <HI>according to evidence.</HI> Without he is free from the&s;e entanglements upon his mind, he will&mdash;he mu&s;t err. Now, it appears by the evidence of even Mr. Rhoad him&s;elf, that he was warm, and might have forgotten the expre&s;&s;ions, and nothing can be &s;hown, but that Mayer, the witne&s;s, who has lived in thas country, is a man of good character; however, he mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;o, until he can be proved otherwi&s;e. Mr. Lewis remarked, that the witne&s;&s;es &s;poke of different conver&s;ations: Mayer of one, when Rhoad came fir&s;t to town; the others of two afterwards, in the room where they were &s;itting, and in the bed-room. He contended that no material, although a verbal difference did exi&s;t; but the te&s;timony of Rhoads differed materially from them all; his verbal te&s;timony and depo&s;ition was al&s;o different, as might be &s;een. But Mr. Lewis &s;aid, he doubted whether the te&s;timony of Rhoad in this matter, was legal evidence or not, becau&s;e it was a matter in which he was materially concerned, how|ever they had not much objected, as there was a con&s;iderable diffe|rence in evidence going to a court, and to a jury; he had no doubt, their honors would make the nece&s;&s;ary allowance.</P>
<P>Although Rhoad was not &s;worn at the time he u&s;ed the&s;e ex|pre&s;&s;ions, he was &s;ummoned on this trial, and it was on high mi&s;de|meanor, whether it was indictable or not, he would not &s;ay, but it was a very imprudent di&s;po&s;ition: to encourage or even &s;uffer. In
<PB N="33" REF="037104_0262_100D808739DC4D38">
Salkeld, 153, Cook's ca&s;e, chief ju&s;tice Holt holds, that if a man ought not to be compelled to prove that he is a party, neither &s;hould he be allowed to prove that he is not a party, by his own evidence: this ap|plies to Rhoad giving evidence, in which his character is concerned. 4 &s;tate trials 747&mdash;8 the ca&s;e appears more fully: &s;uch a conduct is here declared to be &s;candalous, and a mi&s;demeanor, and the man <HI>ought not to be on any jury.</HI> By four witne&s;&s;es, neither incon&s;i&s;tent with them|&s;elves, nor with each other, Mr. Lewis &s;aid this fact was clearly proved, and he thought incontrovertibly &s;o: of the re&s;pectability of tho&s;e witne&s;&s;es, he knew nothing; but nothing di&s;re&s;pectful had been proved, and con&s;equently not their incompetency.</P>
<P>JUDGE PETERS &s;aid that he did not know about their &s;wearing fal&s;ely, nor could he &s;ay any thing about Mayer, but of the others he well knew that one was extremely &s;tupid, and the others deeply pre|judiced, on which account, their evidence &s;hould be carefully &s;crutini|zed, and carefully received.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ity of great precaution and care, Mr. Lewis was willing to admit; but this &s;tupidity was a good apology for their not revealing the fact, until it was drawn from them: their ignorance indeed, was deducible from the whole of their conduct, and the oppo&s;ition they made to the government, but it did not &s;trike at their credibility: uninformed, and mi&s;informed as they were, their verity might be good. They were under indictments, and therefore perhaps afraid to &s;peak; be&s;ides, coming from different parts of the country, they knew not John Fries: but let their offence or &s;ituation be what it may, they may be hone&s;t men, and men of truth and integrity, and therefore they mu&s;t &s;tand upon as good a footing as witne&s;&s;es could &s;tand.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t take it for granted then, &s;aid Mr. Lewis, that the juror made the&s;e declarations, and if &s;o, according to the law of England, and of the United States, he is di&s;qualified from the office, otherwi&s;e, that mo&s;t invaluable right, <HI>trial by jury,</HI> would be eminently impaired.</P>
<P>MR. LEWIS then examined &s;ome authorities which had been quo|ted by the pro&s;ecuting coun&s;el, &s;ome of which were irrelevant, and &s;ome he thought not at all applicable. With re&s;pect to the ca&s;e of Ann Clifton, as quoted from the Penn&s;ylvania practices, the juror de|clared that <Q>he did not know how any body could do otherwi&s;e than bring her in guilty, but he did not &s;peak as a <HI>juryman.</HI></Q> The court were of opinion, it was not &s;ufficient to grant a new trial. The ob|jection of the court was not becau&s;e it was a <HI>capital case,</HI> but they gave as a rea&s;on, that the&s;e words were not &s;ufficient to vitiate a ju|ror: his mind as a juror, he declared was &s;till open to conviction.</P>
<P>It was &s;tated, that the application ought not to be li&s;tened to, be|cau&s;e the pri&s;oner had the challenge of <HI>sixty eight</HI> in effect, out of the whole pannel: how this was meant to be applied, he could not di&s;|cover, but one fact was plain, that the &s;maller number there were &s;ummoned above 35, the better choice there was for the pri&s;oner, and therefore the whole number cannot be made to exceed 60, agreeable to common law. Mr. Lewis then ob&s;erved, that one remark of Mr. Rawle, that Mr. Rhoad was the la&s;t they could challenge, but they would rather have him, than tru&s;t to the next, was a plain implication
<PB N="34" REF="037104_0263_100D8088C3EE5CE8">
that they were ignorant of the fact, in&s;tead of militating again&s;t the motion. In order to remove every &s;u&s;picion of inaccuracy from the former te&s;timony, he &s;aid, he had happily been able to procure one, who&s;e re&s;pectability could not be que&s;tioned, and which he &s;hould now introduce to the court.</P>

<P>MR. LEWIS re&s;umed his argument in favor of the evidence, which he &s;aid, had not Mr. Yohe came forward, the others being &s;u&s;pected, would have been a que&s;tion, whether the negative te&s;timony of Mr. Rhoad, in which he was a party, or the po&s;itive te&s;timony of four others, who were not concerned, had the mo&s;t weight; but now,
<PB N="35" REF="037104_0264_100D808A4A0B8880">
taking it for granted, that Rhoad is mi&s;taken, it can be only accounted for in two ways: fir&s;t, that his memory failed him; or &s;econdly, that he was extremely prejudiced: imputing nothing corrupt to him, &s;till we cannot allow him to be le&s;s &s;o than any one of the five witne&s;&s;es we have brought to controvert his a&s;&s;ertions: allowing him not to be free from prejudice, he cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to be capable of judging for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>MR. LEWIS then mentioned another objection founded on the act which &s;ays, <Q>in ca&s;es puni&s;hable with death, the trial &s;hall be held in the county,</Q> &amp;c. To remove this, one of two things mu&s;t take place: the court in whom is the di&s;cretion, mu&s;t, from facts within their own knowledge, or facts laid properly before them, order it el&s;ewhere; otherwi&s;e &s;econdly, it mu&s;t take place in the city of Philadelphia, as a matter of cour&s;e, as the law has, without a contrary nece&s;&s;ity, fixed on the county, no entry need be made: but if that nece&s;&s;ity did exi&s;t, it ought to be entered. How the order was taken, and by what application the court was removed, he would not &s;ay, all he contended for, was, that it mu&s;t appear the court did &s;o adjudge it, and for good rea&s;ons. The court could not be changed, but under certain circum|&s;tances; the&s;e occurring mu&s;t appear on the record of the court. A motion was agitated on this point, and decided again&s;t, but all that appears upon record, is that the motion was refu&s;ed: whether amend|ment can or cannot be made after trial, he would not contend, but he had doubts. He quoted Hawk. C. 22, 129. Lord Raimond 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">1.</P>
<P>Farther. The court did not direct from what part of the &s;tate the jury were to come, but left it to the mar&s;hal, or el&s;e the mar&s;hal ex|erci&s;ed it without authority or power. To him the judiciary act &s;ect. 29 appeared too plain to be mi&s;taken, or to be open to con&s;truction: by this it appeared that part of judicial proceedings was left&mdash;not to the mar&s;hal, but to the judge of the court, and on him it was enjoined as a duty, which, if left to the mar&s;hal, would give ju&s;t cau&s;e of excepti|on in the power of the pri&s;oner: This was the practice of the mar|&s;hal; a practice entirely new, and could have no manner of weight, becau&s;e the contrary was the po&s;itive law of the land, and if &s;o, nothing could contravene it; it was &s;o except that power was transferred to the mar&s;hal from the court, for if this could be left, be did not &s;ee why a great part of the duty of a judge could not be left for the mar|&s;hal to exerci&s;e as well! The mar&s;hal could upon the &s;ame principle, a&s;&s;ume the bench and try cau&s;es, becau&s;e the law in that part of his duty does not a&s;&s;ign it more to the judge than in the other. Certain duties were a&s;&s;igned to the judge, to the clerk, and to the mar&s;hal, to which each was re&s;pectively bound. The fir&s;t &s;tate trials were in 1795, and there both the judges gave the order in court, how the jury &s;hould be &s;ummoned, directing that at lea&s;t 48 &s;hould be &s;um|moned to attend for the trial of certain per&s;ons, and at lea&s;t 12 from the proper counties&mdash;48 were to come from the &s;tate at large. The <HI>venire facias</HI> mu&s;t be &s;igned by the judge and &s;ent to the mar&s;hal as his direction, otherwi&s;e a &s;eparate order of direction &s;o &s;igned, though not on the <HI>venire</HI> may an&s;wer the purpo&s;e. Re&s;pecting the twelve from the county, Mr. Lewis &s;aid he concurred in &s;entiment, that it
<PB N="36" REF="037104_0265_100D808C46C36A30">
was not nece&s;&s;ary the direction &s;hould be given, becau&s;e the law re|quired it as indi&s;pen&s;ible, on which account he &s;uppo&s;ed it was that judge Peters ju&s;t reminded the mar&s;hal that capital acts had been committed in certain counties. In an&s;wer to this it was &s;aid that the whole directions were given by the judge, but he contended that the whole mu&s;t be in conformity, and mu&s;t come from the court, and the mar&s;hal could not take it up of his own accord. It was &s;aid that there had been but one in&s;tance of this &s;pecial order; true, but there had no more than one in&s;tance occurred to occa&s;ion it. If Congre&s;s had not thought it a power nece&s;&s;ary to be exerci&s;ed by a judge, it would not have been a law, and though exerci&s;ed but once, or although not at all it was equally &s;o, for the law may &s;leep, but it cannot die, nor will it be called up, but when occa&s;ion demands.</P>
<P>Farther. The mar&s;hal, without any direction from the court, or a judge thereof, has returned a greater number of jurors than he was legally authorized to do. By the act of Congre&s;s, a &s;ingle judge is empowered to hold court in certain ca&s;es, but if that judge was to give an order out of the time of holding court, it would be con&s;idered as an act of the judge and not of the court, and therefore not an of|ficial nor legal order. The <HI>venire</HI> in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance is not &s;igned by the judge, but by the clerk, wherein a return of &s;ixty is authori|zed, but not a word about the county, therefore the &s;ixty are &s;ummon|ed from the &s;tate: thus the venire goes to the mar&s;hal, whom the judge &s;ees, and informs him that the ca&s;e is capital, on which account, in addition to the &s;ixty returned in the venire, he makes a due and regular return of twelve from one county, and &s;eventeen from another, &s;igned with his own name: no doubt this was in con&s;equence of the intimation received from the judge. He had before gone as far as his authority led him, and now he annexes twenty-nine in a &s;eparate paper under the &s;ame order, which gave no &s;uch directions, but only that not le&s;s than forty-eight nor more than &s;ixty &s;hould be &s;ummon|ed. The pannel is compleated, but whether the intimation or order of the judge was given before or after, we know not: to give the in|timation was right, but a wrong u&s;e was made of it, for tho&s;e from the county ought to have been included in that pannel, which he might have included, by fir&s;t &s;triking out the &s;ame number, any time before it came into court, and there his power would have end|ed, and every thing would have been right except his having had no order from the judge; but twenty-nine more are annexed, which not being done under the venire was improper, and if it had been, it would have been equally &s;o, becau&s;e not authoritatively given. The court have power to direct &s;uch a return as they think proper, under the di|rection of the law, but if this is the act of a clerk, judge or mar&s;hal, it is irregular. Part of the number of &s;ixty, and not beyond it, &s;hould come from the county, except the expre&s;s order, of, and &s;igned by the court, &s;hould otherwi&s;e direct. But in this ca&s;e even the twelve is exceeded, and &s;eventeen more annexed: under that venire he might have returned the whole from the county, but he could return no part above &s;ixty. Here is a certificate produced by his honor Judge Peters, &s;ignifying that he had told the mar&s;hal it was a capital ca&s;e, and
<PB N="37" REF="037104_0266_100D808F653E6898">
twelve mu&s;t be &s;ummoned from the county of Northampton: this is to be filed as an excu&s;e for the &s;urplus, for there cannot be an addi|tional venire! In the trials of 1795, there were 108 jurors &s;ummon|ed, 72 from the &s;tate at large and 36 from three counties named, but that was by different pannells, and the &s;ame could have been done now in the like way, and with the like authority, but this &s;urplus is not to be annexed to the &s;ingle pannel. This certificate of the judge cannot amount to any thing whatever, and his honor could not have meant to give it as any thing like legal authority, all the official acts of a judge mu&s;t be in writing, &s;ome way or other in order that he may be made re&s;pon&s;ible, otherwi&s;e it mu&s;t; depend upon his memory, and too much upon his will. But this never can be meant as a legal act.</P>
<P>In 1795 an act of A&s;&s;embly of Penn&s;ylvania, limited the greate&s;t number of the jurors to be &s;ummoned from the &s;tate at large to &s;ixty, and not le&s;s than forty-eight. The court determined that they could not be governed by act of alterably but by common law. See 2 Dallas, but &s;till the matter was left to the judges, and not the mar&s;hal: the judges exerci&s;ed di&s;cretion according to circum&s;tances, but the act of Congre&s;s requiring twelve from the county remains binding, and is pre&s;erved as an invaluable privilege to which every man is entitled; he can be tried by men of his own neighborhood, and &s;urely if this is &s;uch a privilege in common law, and e&s;teemed in England as well as America, he has a much greater chance of getting his neighbors from the &s;maller number than from the greater; and if this number is farther exceeded by twenty-nine, the chance is &s;till le&s;s. The mar&s;hal may be a man of virtue&mdash;&s;uch is the pre&s;ent mar&s;hal; but a man of a different character might &s;ucceed him, and he is to hold his place during will and plea&s;ure. Now if it is con&s;idered as a privilege that a man &s;hould have as many of his neighbors as he can to try him, and the increa&s;e of number dimini&s;hes that privilege, and, increa&s;ed to a certain extent, almo&s;t annihilates it, and if it is con&s;idered that the mar&s;hal has this authority, (which I deny) how little chance has the pri&s;oner, and how much power has the mar&s;hal over him! For this rea&s;on the law in|tru&s;ts the court with this power, and will not, nor has ever intru&s;ted it to the mar&s;hal. (He here quoted 3 Bacon 245, and Keyling 16.) The ca&s;es referred to by Mr. Rawle; Mr. Lewis &s;aid was done by &s;e|parate pannels, as in 1795&mdash;2 Hale, 263&mdash;4 Black. 344&mdash;11 Mod. 1&mdash;and 5 Bacon, 244.</P>
<P>When the&s;e directions are not complied with, the proceedings are null and void, for the &s;heriff not following the order of the court are good rea&s;on for a new trial, and therefore we conclude that the pre&s;ent jurors, &s;even of them actually &s;erving, not being &s;ummoned by the order of the court, but by an a&s;&s;umed power of the mar&s;hal, both as to place and number, makes a mis-trial. 21 Viner, 172, has a ca&s;e &s;imilar to the pre&s;ent: one per&s;on on the jury was illegally admitted, accordingly the court &s;et a&s;ide the verdict: on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion there are &s;even illegally admitted. There was a ca&s;e when two in|dictments were brought in, and two pannels &s;ummoned, but it hap|pened that the one &s;ummoned to try A, tried, B, and vice ver&s;a:&mdash;they were tried and both convicted; but on the plea, new trials were
<PB N="38" REF="037104_0267_100D8092CBDA1E60">
ordered becau&s;e they were not the men &s;ummoned for the purpo&s;e&mdash;2 Hawk. C. 27, &s;ect. 108, 9, 10. See law of errors 65. The authori|ties referred to &s;how how it may be amended&mdash;the court are bound to render all which has been done null and void. In Aurundell's ca&s;e, 6 Cook, the error was as to the jury proce&s;s for murder: the court &s;et a&s;ide the verdict, &s;eeing that while there was error in the jury proce&s;s, his life had not even been put in danger: every thing el&s;e was regular&mdash;the jury was returned from the pari&s;h where the of|fence was laid; (the very pari&s;h, and not the city was named,) the trial went on, and no challenge was made in the array, but for the above rea&s;on all was &s;et a&s;ide, and a <HI>venire facias de novo</HI> granted.&mdash;Thus it may be &s;een challenge to the array after challenge to the poll is not too late, if good cau&s;e be a&s;&s;igned&mdash;2 Lord Raymond, 884.</P>
<P>The gentleman on the other &s;ide has oppo&s;ed a &s;pecious argument as to number, to wit, that the words of the venire are, you &s;hall cau&s;e to come before the court &s;uch a number, and therefore, although a much greater number were &s;ummoned, and no more than the legal number appear in court, there is no cau&s;e of complaint, but this is the common form of a venire. But in what manner is the officer to <HI>com|pel</HI> the pannel to appear before the court? By &s;ummoning them, o|therwi&s;e they are fined. In a legal view as it re&s;pects the venire, they did all appear before the court. Hale, Black&s;tone, nor any of the authorities &s;ay how many &s;hall come, but how many &s;hall be &s;um|moned.</P>
<P>Mr. LEWIS here concluded a very laborious inve&s;tigation of the points of law referring to the motion, and &s;ubmitted them to the con|&s;ideration of the court, tru&s;ting that if his client was at la&s;t to fall a victim, it would be to the &s;word of ju&s;tice, and not to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of public opinion, &s;eeing that the important proceedings on his ca&s;e would operate as a precedent to be tran&s;mitted down to po&s;terity. He would leave the event with full &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, impre&s;&s;ed with a firm reliance on the impartial and ju&s;t deci&s;ion of the court.</P>
<P>Mr. DALLAS ob&s;erved that the jurors were not alone &s;ummoned from Northampton county, but five on the jury were from Bucks county.</P>
<P>Mr. RAWLE an&s;wered that there was a bill of indictment for trea&s;on committed in Bucks county, and therefore the mar&s;hal had &s;ummoned them to be ready. They could as well be on the pre&s;ent jury as tho&s;e from Philadelphia, &s;ince there were twelve &s;ummoned from the proper county, and the law not departed from in that re&s;pect.</P>
<P>The court, ob&s;erving that the depo&s;ition of Mr. Rhoad, and the evidence given by Mr. Yohe contradicted each other, &s;ugge&s;ted the propriety of confronting the witne&s;&s;es in open court, in order to di&s;tin|gui&s;h where the error was, accordingly</P>

<HEAD>In the Evening the Court again meet.</HEAD>
<P>JUDGE PETERS ob&s;erved that the opinion of lord chief ju&s;tice Trevy, in 4 State Trials was much to the point, but that que&s;tion was not determined by the court. In a que&s;tion of &s;o much national importance as the pre&s;ent, Judge Peters thought it his duty to give au opinion.&mdash;A man who lives in the county where in&s;urrection has happened, his impre&s;&s;ions of injury from the repetitions of &s;uch &s;cenes will be &s;tronger than might be expected in other men, and therefore all that Rhoad &s;aid about it being un&s;afe for the friends of govern|ment to live there, is accounted for, and no way improper for him to &s;peak. I think Rhoad an hone&s;t man, and do not think he had any malice again&s;t Fries more than any of the re&s;t, but I think he mu&s;t have forgotten. As to what appeared to &s;trike Mr. Lewis with &s;uch force, does not appear to me important. I think the proceedings might have been more regular, but yet I think they were regular enough to &s;tamp the event with a &s;ufficient &s;anction. The proceedings were much the &s;ame as the court of Oyer and Terminor, when the &s;heriff &s;ummons a number more than is wanted, in order to have them ready, and when twelve are wanted, they are taken out of that num|ber. This venire i&s;&s;ued by the &s;ame cour&s;e as all others do, perhaps not knowing the offences would be capital, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> it appearing otherwi&s;e afterwards, agreeable to act of Congre&s;s &s;ome were &s;ummoned from the proper counties. The venire &s;ays the number is not to exceed 60, yet the&s;e words do not de&s;ignate more than tho&s;e in the practice of Eng|land which directs 12, but 24 is generally returned. To be &s;ure the court might have given the order, but I do not &s;ee how this could be done without the defendant lying in gaol, or a &s;pecial court being hold|en. There is &s;ome weight to be &s;ure in the arguments on that point, but they are not &s;o important as they were held up to be. The mar|&s;hal having ready a certain number, when the i&s;&s;ue was joined, then, and not before, was the number who did appear, made to appear in court. The pannel was returned, and furni&s;hed to Fries, on which, the trial was &s;uffered to proceed, and on that account I think it ap|pears it was approved of by the court, which is a &s;ufficient de&s;ignation.</P>
<P>JUDGE IREDELL&mdash;The que&s;tion which the court have now to de|cide is certainly as important an one as ever was before a court. With regard to any intere&s;t, the government could be &s;uppo&s;ed to have in the event, or the feelings of private humanity or compa&s;&s;ion as men, for the very unhappy &s;ituation of the pri&s;oner&mdash;the&s;e mu&s;t both be &s;acrificed to that impartial ju&s;tice which our duty preremptorily com|mands us to exerci&s;e according to the be&s;t of our capacities. Sure I am that it is always my di&s;po&s;ition &s;o to be influenced, as I am con|vinced it is al&s;o of the judge with whom I have the honor to &s;it on the bench.</P>
<P>It is admitted, I believe on both &s;ides, that it is in the power of the court in criminal ca&s;es to grant a new trial in favor of the pri&s;on|er, though they cannot to his perjudice, and it mu&s;t be readily ad|mitted that it mu&s;t be the mo&s;t obvious con&s;iderations, which could po&s;&s;ible under it the duty of the court, le&s;t they <HI>too readily</HI> grant a
<PB N="42" REF="037104_0271_100D8574E1A20FC8">
new trial: for if the power is placed in a court, it is proof that it mu&s;t, or might be &s;ometime exerci&s;ed, and if ever proper occa&s;ion ari&s;e for the exerci&s;e of it, it mu&s;t depend on &s;ome particular, &s;trikingly ap|plicable circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>With regard to the particular circum&s;tance now brought forward, that one of the jurymen made certain declarations unfavorable to the ju&s;tice, a pri&s;oner has a right to expect, I mu&s;t confe&s;s that until the evidence ye&s;terday given by Mr. Yohe, I was not &s;atisfied that he had &s;aid any &s;uch thing as could give the court full ground to believe him improperly bia&s;&s;ed, &s;o as to admit ju&s;t cau&s;e for a new trial; but that te&s;timony corroborating the te&s;timony of tho&s;e before given on which, independantly, we could place but little dependance, &s;trikes me with great force, otherwi&s;e I &s;hould have entertained &s;ome doubt owing to their different relations of apparently the &s;ame event. This caution was invigorated by the very excellent character which the juror had borne. From this I have every rea&s;on to believe that he has not willfully done any thing wrong, nor &s;worn to any thing which he does not believe to be true. From the relation, it was difficult to arrange the particular parts of the conver&s;ation &s;o as to make it accord at any interval of time, on which account I was extremely de&s;irous that Mr. Rhoad and Mr. Yohe &s;hould be confronted, and que&s;tions put to re|mind each other of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> facts, &s;o as both might accord; but it does appear that Mr. Rhoad's memory is extremely defective in &s;ome ma|terial points, and therefore, without any impeachment we may pre|&s;ume it was a gro&s;s mi&s;take. It is the clear opinion of the court in 4 State Trials, that if a juryman, not out of particular malice again&s;t the individual, but from any <HI>other</HI> cau&s;e appears to have formed a pre|determined opinion, he was not fit to be a juryman, and it was there|fore good cau&s;e of challenge. In that ca&s;e the expre&s;&s;ions u&s;ed were much &s;imilar to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e: that opinion appears to be grounded upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that were a man, from any ill motives, <HI>or other|wise,</HI> forms an opinion &s;trongly on his mind, an improper bias is ex|tremely difficult to get clear of, and will influence an hone&s;t man un|warily to give a wrong verdict, and to the&s;e circum&s;tances every man is liable. It is impo&s;&s;ible for me to re&s;i&s;t the impre&s;&s;ion, from the number of depo&s;itions produced, that Mr. Rhoad mu&s;t, at different times, have u&s;ed expre&s;&s;ions &s;imilar to tho&s;e related by Mr. Yohe, but I can readily conceive that &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions were u&s;ed with an inno|cent intention, and without meaning to prejudice him&s;elf from after|wards &s;erving as an hone&s;t juryman, yet I cannot be certain, but it might originate from a predi&s;po&s;ed opinion of the guilt of the man, and therefore it mu&s;t render him le&s;s able to di&s;criminate facts, but if no &s;uch idea of guilt did exi&s;t, according to the authority &s;tated, it would be good cau&s;e of challenge, if known, but if not known until after verdict is given, it would then be &s;ufficient time, for what is good cau&s;e of challenge previous to trial, is good ground for a motion after verdict. It is very much to be regretted that the witne&s;&s;es who heard the&s;e declarations did none of them communicate it to the coun&s;el or the pri&s;oner before the jury were &s;worn, becau&s;e he might have been &s;et a&s;ide, and much unnece&s;&s;ary public expence and di&s;&s;tre&s;s to the un|fortunate

<P>It being admitted that the court may grant a new trial in criminal ca&s;es upon &s;ufficient cau&s;e to &s;how, and it following that they ought to do it if &s;hown, I farther think that if there is cau&s;e of challenge before, there is equal cau&s;e, if it is proved that the juror was bia&s;&s;ed, to order it, after verdict is pronounced, whatever delay or inconve|nience may re&s;ult therefrom; that can be no rea&s;on to withhold a pri|viledge to which a pri&s;oner is entitled: from the&s;e views, I think it my duty to vote for a new trial in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, as the fact ap|pears too clear to be controverted. In this event, there will be &s;till an opportunity for the pri&s;oner to be freed, and ju&s;tice be done between him&s;elf and his country.</P>
<P>With regard to the point of law, if my mind had not been clear on the evidence re&s;pecting the juror, I &s;hould have been decidedly again&s;t a new trial, and accordingly &s;hould have taken the trouble more fully to have delivered my &s;entiments; it being &s;o, I &s;hall now make but a few general remarks. As to the point, that the record &s;hould evince the proceedings of the court, otherwise they are invalid, with rea&s;ons why trial could not be held in the county, I think there is no nece&s;&s;ity of the rea&s;ons appearing on the record of court. If the que&s;tion had &s;tood &s;imply upon this ground, it would have been immaterial; but it did not: application was made to the court, after &s;everal indictments were found, alledging that the trials ought to be held in the county, whereupon the court declared opinion, that "great inconvenience" prevented a compliance with the motion: but farther, it appeared to be gone out of the power of the court, becau&s;e the indictment had been found in this court, which mu&s;t be con&s;idered a part of the trial; and the law means the whole proceeding &s;hall be in one place, &s;o that the indictment mu&s;t have been found in that county, otherwi&s;e the trial by jury could not be held there. The&s;e were the rea&s;ons which operated to influence the court to refu&s;e the application. In this dilemma, it was impo&s;&s;ible for the court to &s;ay the trial &s;hould not proceed here; and had it been removed, a new indictment could not have been found; if it had, the trial could not proceed upon two indictments. The only times for con&s;idering this que&s;tion, I believe, was, when this man was charged with the offence, before he was committed, or even after the court &s;at, and before the indictment was brought into court. If it had been the opinion of the judge who committed him, that trial could be held there, then it could have been referred to the &s;upreme court, who, if they had been of the &s;ame opinion, would have ordered a &s;pecial court. But from the &s;tate of that county, no one can believe that trial could have been held there in any way conducive to ju&s;tice, or &s;o as to make the proceedings of the court &s;uch as they ought to be, becau&s;e the Pre&s;ident has declared, by proclamation, that the law could not be executed without military a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which I never wi&s;h to &s;ee guard a court of ju&s;tice as matter of choice, though unavoidable ne|ce&s;&s;ity may &s;ometimes make it prudent.</P>
<P>With regard to the &s;ummoning the jury, it is to be ob&s;erved that the practice now u&s;ed, was an e&s;tabli&s;hed u&s;age of this court for
<PB N="44" REF="037104_0273_100D85780C0364C8">
many years pa&s;t, which is a &s;anction &s;ufficient, if no po&s;itive law nul|lifies it. The venire, i&s;&s;ued in this form, in my opinion, did i&s;&s;ue with the &s;anction of the court, and had the &s;ame effect, as though the expre&s;s order of the court had been annexed. It appears that it was not known, at the time the venire i&s;&s;ued, that any ca&s;es were puni&s;h|able with death, and of cour&s;e not nece&s;&s;ary to include a &s;pecial pro|vi&s;ion for twelve to come from the county. Mr. Lewis made a con|ce&s;&s;ion, which, if right, did away the whole of this objection: he &s;aid, that upon the mar&s;hal's receiving information (whether it came from the judge or not) that a ca&s;e puni&s;hable with death had occurred, he had a right, without any order from the court, written or verbal, to &s;ummon a greater number of men than in other ca&s;es: the words of the law are, not that he &s;hould &s;ummon twelve, but twelve at lea&s;t; but be ob&s;erved that this &s;hould not exceed, but be included in the number &s;ixty. I do not know what authority he had to limit the number to &s;ixty, in this or any other ca&s;e. The law intends that a pri&s;oner &s;hall have a chance of men from his own neighborhood; cer|tainly then the greater the number which comes from it, his chance is proportionably increa&s;ed, therefore it can never prejudice the pri&s;oner. I think that if the mar&s;hal &s;hould extend the di&s;cretion given him to an unnece&s;&s;ary number, it would operate to the vexation of the per|&s;ons &s;ummoned, and they alone would have cau&s;e to complain. For|merly, by law, a &s;heriff was directed to &s;ummon twelve, but by u&s;age, he actually did &s;ummon twenty-four, yet all above the twelve appeared to acquie&s;ce, and it could not be of di&s;advantage: &s;o in the grand-jury for twenty-four, forty-eight was &s;ummoned: the power was a&s;|&s;umed and not complained of. I pre&s;ume that if the mar&s;hal had authority to return that number, without a venire or precept, he was not limited as to number; and that when they came here, they formed the jury attending court. I am farther of opinion, that when the pannel was pre&s;ented to the pri&s;oner, that pannel obtained the full &s;anction of the court, as much as though they had given the order.</P>
<P>So far as to &s;ub&s;tance. With re&s;pect to form, the words are, after joining the i&s;&s;ue, "let the jury come." That is a direction given by the court to the mar&s;hal to &s;ummon the jury, but as it would be in|convenient for him to &s;ummon the jury after this order, which is for him to do it without delay, tho&s;e jurors already &s;ummoned appear in court, &s;o that if it was entered upon record it would appear that after the pri&s;oner was arraigned, and i&s;&s;ue joined, the mar&s;hal had directed the&s;e men to come, and they had come. It appears to me that whe|ther the mar&s;hal &s;ummoned the jurors of his own accord, or whether they were &s;ummoned under the expre&s;s order of the court after i&s;&s;ue was joined, in &s;ub&s;tance and in form the law is &s;o far complied with as to do perfect ju&s;tice. Though I am not certain that my opinion on the&s;e points of law are right, not having had much time to exa|mine, yet I am &s;trongly of that opinion at pre&s;ent; however I have thought le&s;s and &s;aid le&s;s upon them than if the main object of the mo|tion re&s;ted on it.</P>
<P>Sen&s;ible of the importance of the que&s;tion, and that if life is once lo&s;t it can never be recovered; having a&s;ide the que&s;tion which in|volves
<PB N="45" REF="037104_0274_100D857B8764FD78">
doubt, and re&s;ting on the facts which have appeared before the court, I deem it my duty to &s;ay that A NEW TRIAL OUGHT TO BE GRANTED.</P>
<P>JUDGE PETERS. Upon the points of law urged, I &s;hould have thought proper to have given my opinion, although they would have materially differed from that of a gentleman who&s;e law knowledge I much re&s;pect; yet I think it at this time unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay any thing farther than that I agree in the opinions of the gentleman with whom I &s;it.</P>
<P>As to the other point, to wit the conduct of this juror, I confe&s;s that my mind is not compleatly made up: I think that all which can be &s;aid on that is, that no juryman ought to go into that box with prejudice upon his mind. In a ca&s;e which the public at large mu&s;t feel materially intere&s;ted, it is impo&s;&s;ible to keep the mind from being affected; all the citizens will have their feelings; the que&s;tion then in, whether this one individual had or had not particular malice again&s;t the pri&s;oner? If not the evidence would weigh lightly on my mind: upon this point I confe&s;s my&s;elf to have doubts.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>very striking expressions</HI> the juror &s;wears he cannot recollect u&s;ing, although the others &s;wear that he did u&s;e them. I am &s;till doubtful, from the light opinions I entertain of all the witne&s;&s;es ex|cept one, whom I do not know, but if any impre&s;&s;ions are made upon my mind favorable to the motion, his evidence has made them, other|wi&s;e I could not he&s;itate what opinion to form.</P>
<P>I know the event of a refu&s;al; I know that a divi&s;ion of the court will be the con&s;equence, and the man mu&s;t be left to the mercy of the executive. Individual puni&s;hment is nothing to public example; on the other hand the con&s;equences of a new trial would be to delay the exerci&s;e of ju&s;tice. I am &s;atisfied that the pri&s;oner has had a fair and impartial trial, with all the advantages he could de&s;ire; but as I think <HI>public example</HI> is the only object which the law contemplates, and as that public example will have a far more forcible effect when <HI>every excuse</HI> is removed, and the public fully &s;atisfied with the pro|ceedings of this court, which may not be the ca&s;e if a divi&s;ion of the court takes place, I rather yield my opinion to the nece&s;&s;ity, than a conviction of the ju&s;tice of a new trial. On the&s;e accounts I &s;ubmit to &s;ay that THERE SHALL BE A NEW TRIAL.</P>

<P>MR. DALLAS conte&s;ted the juri&s;diction of the court upon the general po&s;ition that an indictment found in the city and county of Philadel|phia, could not be tried at a court holden at Norri&s;town. The con&s;titution and laws of the United States, he ob&s;erved, were founded upon this princi|ple: that the criminal &s;hould always be tried as near the place where the crime was committed as circum&s;tances would admit; which was to be in the county, unle&s;s manife&s;t inconvenience &s;hould operate to prevent it. The circuit court could appoint &s;pecial courts for the trial of criminal ca&s;es, but not for civil ca&s;es. Laws of United States p. 226 vol. 2.</P>
<P>But the di&s;trict judge ordered the court to be holden at this place, agreeable to the powers he was ve&s;ted with by the quarantine and health law, pa&s;&s;ed February 25th 1799. Sect. 5th and 7th reads thus: Sect. 5th It &s;hall be lawful for the judge of any di&s;trict court of the United States, within who&s;e di&s;trict any contagious or epidemical di&s;|ea&s;e &s;hall at any time prevail, &s;o as in his opinion, to endanger the life, or lives of any per&s;on or per&s;ons confined in the pri&s;on of &s;uch di&s;trict, in pur&s;uance of any law of the United States, to direct the mar&s;hal to cau&s;e the per&s;on or per&s;ons confined as afore&s;aid, to be removed to the next adjacent pri&s;on, where &s;uch di&s;ea&s;e does not pre|vail, there to be confined until he, &s;he, or they, may be &s;afely removed back to the place of their fir&s;t confinement, which remove &s;hall be at the expence of the United States.</P>
<P><HI>Sect.</HI> 7. That whenever, in the opinion of the chief ju&s;tice, or in ca&s;e of his death, or inability, of the &s;enior a&s;&s;ociate ju&s;tice of the &s;upreme court of the United States, a contagious &s;ickne&s;s &s;hall render it hazardous to hold the next &s;tated &s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;aid court at the
<PB N="47" REF="037104_0276_100D857F65F5C9E8">
&s;eat of government, it &s;hall be lawful for the chief or a&s;&s;ociate ju&s;tice, to i&s;&s;ue his order to the mar&s;hal of the di&s;trict within which the &s;u|preme court is by law to be holden, directing him to adjourn the &s;aid &s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;aid court to &s;uch other place within the &s;ame, or any adjoining di&s;trict as he may deem convenient; and the &s;aid mar&s;hal &s;hall thereupon adjourn the &s;aid court, by making publication thereof in one or more public papers printed at the place, by law ap|pointed for holding the &s;ame, from the time he &s;hall receive &s;uch or|der, until the time by law pre&s;cribed for commencing the &s;aid &s;e&s;&s;ion. And the di&s;trict judges &s;hall, re&s;pectively, under the &s;ame circum|&s;tances, have the &s;ame power, by the &s;ame means, to direct adjourn|ments of the di&s;trict and circuit courts within the &s;everal di&s;tricts to &s;ome convenient place within the &s;ame re&s;pectively.</P>
<P>Neither time nor place could be changed in civil ca&s;es, but both time and place might be changed in criminal ca&s;es.</P>
<P>MR. DALLAS then proceeded to apply the&s;e laws to the pre&s;ent mo|tion: &s;uppo&s;ing that the place of trial ought to have been at or near where the crime was committed, yet it was determined at the March term that it &s;hould not be held nearer than at Philadelphia, although Norris town was nearer than Philadelphia. It was then laid down as an e&s;tabli&s;hed principle by both the judges, that the indictment was part of the trial, and where the trial was commenced, there it mu&s;t be concluded; and therefore a motion to remove the pri&s;oners for trial to the county where the offences were committed, were over|ruled.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, he would ob&s;erve, that the trial ought to have been held in the county: the judiciary act, vol. I. p. 67, provided that the trial &s;hould be in the county where the crime was committed. Sub&s;equent to that, an amendment to the con&s;titution (8th) was pa&s;&s;ed, providing, "That in all criminal pro&s;ecutions, the accu&s;ed &s;hall enjoy the right to a &s;peedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and <HI>district</HI> wherein the crime &s;hall have been committed." From this Mr. Dallas conceived it clear, that what was called <HI>district</HI> in the con&s;titution was &s;ynonimous <HI>county</HI> in the law, and recognized that expre&s;&s;ion, and therefore he thought they ought to be tried in one of tho&s;e counties, and at no other place.</P>
<P>But in criminal ca&s;es, there was a di&s;cretionary power in the court, or in the di&s;trict judge, to remove the court in ca&s;e of contagious &s;ickne&s;s, as well as a power to remove the pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>The 5th &s;ection only provides for the removal for &s;afe keeping of the pri&s;oners to the next adjacent pri&s;on, until they can with &s;afety return. The court could be taken any where; but the pri&s;oners could not be taken any where: it mu&s;t be only to the "next adjacent pri&s;on, where &s;uch di&s;ea&s;e does not prevail." Norris town, he contended, was not the next adjacent pri&s;on: it was to be the next pri&s;on, to an adjacent pri&s;on, and to one where the &s;ickne&s;s does not prevail, if it was in the power of the court to di&s;pen&s;e with one of the&s;e rea&s;ons, it was with all. Norris town was 17 miles from Philadelphia, Che&s;ter was but 15, the difference to be &s;ure was but &s;mall, but if the <HI>words</HI> of the law were not binding in every part, the &s;ame di&s;cretionary power might have removed the court 100 miles.
<PB N="48" REF="037104_0277_100D8582AE0DAC40">
The pri&s;oners were therefore not to be tried, but to be kept till they could be removed back with &s;afety.</P>
<P>JUDGE PETERS &s;aid, he contemplated Che&s;ter, but he had heard that there were &s;ome ca&s;es of the fever there, and he knew it had before been much afflicted with it; he therefore did not con&s;ider him&s;elf &s;o clo&s;ely bound as to be forced to go there.</P>
<P>Mr. DALLAS &s;aid, vague report was not to be attended to, or he be|lieved it would be a rea&s;on again&s;t going almo&s;t to every place: a court was held at Che&s;ter on the 9th in&s;t. He believed Che&s;ter an|&s;wered the perfect de&s;cription of the law. But, he &s;aid, the pri&s;oners were removed, not merely for &s;afe-keeping, but for trial; however, he conceived the former deci&s;ion, "that the trial was begun where the indictment was found," mu&s;t prevent the trials being held any where but in Philadelphia, becau&s;e the indictments were found there. Though a habeus corpus was powerful in its operation, yet it was certainly not meant to be in direct oppo&s;ition, and to &s;upercede an act of congre&s;s. Nor was the per&s;onal inconvenience of the court to be con&s;idered; the act of congre&s;s was peremptory, and could not be di&s;&s;ented to from any cau&s;e, without it was by a repealing clau&s;e.</P>
<P>He hoped the court would give an opportunity to his colleague (Mr. Lewis) who was now ab&s;ent, to give his ideas on the &s;ubject. He was &s;ent for, and expected &s;hortly.</P>
<P>MR. RAWLE contended, that there was no divi&s;ion contemplated but that by which the United States were divided into 13 di&s;tricts; he thought it impo&s;&s;ible to conceive that <HI>"district"</HI> meant a county, and therefore the reference to the 8th amendment of the con&s;titution, he thought, no &s;upport to the argument.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the power of the court to try the cau&s;es, Mr. R. thought it clear, that as both in civil and criminal ca&s;es, the courts could be removed, both with re&s;pect to time and place, under certain circum&s;tances, &s;o could the bu&s;ine&s;s of the court al&s;o; this was a matter of cour&s;e, and therefore the power of habeus corpus, to bring all the pri&s;oners up, was in the court. If it were not &s;o, in vain would be the provi&s;ion (at times of &s;ickne&s;s) of the con&s;titution, which directed <HI>a speedy trial,</HI> becau&s;e inevitable delay mu&s;t take place, or the lives of the court and jury, as well as of the pri&s;oners, be in great hazard. He conceived, that the 5th &s;ection, which provided for the removal of the pri&s;oners, was &s;carcely conformable to that part of the con&s;titution which provided for a "&s;peedy" trial, becau&s;e, if the con|&s;truction was, as &s;uppo&s;ed, by the other coun&s;el, it infringed on the pri&s;oner's right: they had no power to keep a man in long confine|ment, until his guilt was a&s;certained; and no prevalence, of di&s;order could authori&s;e them to it.</P>
<P>The gentleman &s;aid, that they were to be taken away for &s;afe-keeping, until they could be returned in &s;afety to the pri&s;on from whence they were taken. Now, &s;uppo&s;e, for in&s;tance, tho&s;e to be removed, who had been &s;entenced for eight months impri&s;onment, and that time expired, whil&s;t they were at &s;ome other pri&s;on, on account of the prevailing &s;ickne&s;s, could it be &s;uppo&s;ed that the law contem|plated that they &s;hould be kept till they could with &s;afety be returned? He pre&s;umed not.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="037104_0278_100D858535071E78">
Would they not thereby have &s;uffered fal&s;e impri&s;onment by being confined longer than the judgment of the court ordered? Mo&s;t cer|tainly they would.</P>
<P>As to the next convenient pri&s;on, Mr. Rawle thought the wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> were not very per&s;picuous, not &s;ufficiently, he thought, at to mea&s;ure geometrical di&s;tances to a nicety. He took it to be one of tho&s;e ca&s;es which would bear a rea&s;onable and circum&s;tantial con&s;truction, and which was left in the judgment of the judge, whether it was conve|nient and &s;afe to be rigorou&s;ly executed, or not: there might be an alarm of di&s;order &s;ufficient to warrant the judge to &s;ay, that it was not &s;afe to lodge the pri&s;oner in one place, and, as another was about the &s;ame di&s;tance, where no &s;uch alarm exi&s;ted, he thought him&s;elf ju&s;|tifiable in ordering their removal to the latter: for though there was provi&s;ion to remove them once, there was no provi&s;ion to remove them away again, even in ca&s;e of alarm, except it was back to the &s;ame pri&s;on they fir&s;t were in. Upon the whole, as to removal, he thought the judge had executed his duty and his clemency. If it had not been right, the pri&s;oners &s;hould have complained at the time of their removal, but they were all perfectly &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the effect the removal would have to the juri&s;dic|tion of the Court, he thought the arguments at the la&s;t court re&s;pect|ing trial in the &s;ame county, would not apply. He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to the argument of Judge Wil&s;on in the ca&s;e of Hamilton, Dallas Reports, 2 vol. p. 760. The Court had power in every county in the &s;tate, becau&s;e the whole &s;tate con&s;tituted but one di&s;trict, in which the law directs them to be tried.</P>
<P>He did not &s;uppo&s;e the matter of convenience was any que&s;tion at all: nor did he believe the Judges would be in the lea&s;t guided by it.</P>
<P>As to the bu&s;ine&s;s began in Philadelphia, in as much as the indict|ment was there brought in, it was &s;tated, that the trial mu&s;t be con|tinued there. This might be al&s;o the means of delay, which the con&s;titution provided again&s;t; but he believed the argument could be an&s;wered in another way. The court was held in Philadelphia, and this bu&s;ine&s;s was continued, and therefore wherever the court &s;at, therefore its bu&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t follow it. What would be the effect el&s;e, of an indictment being found in Norris-town, and the cau&s;e being continued over? Mu&s;t the court remove back here at another &s;e&s;&s;ion, to try the cau&s;e here? This would bring the court into a continual &s;tate of vibration, and ju&s;tice be much delayed. He thought the court was competent to take up what remained of former &s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>MR. DALLAS hoped the court would con&s;ider the great inconveni|ence of the trials, e&s;pecially on the trea&s;on ca&s;es, now going on: the deranged &s;tate of the country, owing to the di&s;order which had driven numbers of citizens from their homes, would make it ruinous to the pri&s;oners; it would prevent the pri&s;oners the opportunity of inquir|ing the characters of the jurors, and al&s;o of procuring witne&s;&s;es. It would doubtle&s;s endanger his life.</P>
<P>Agreeable to Mr. Rawle's argument, Mr. Dallas contended, that the 5th and 7th &s;ections of the Quarrantine Law were at war with each other, and not only &s;o, but with the general policy of the laws and
<PB N="50" REF="037104_0279_100D85878FAE4070">
con&s;titution. But the&s;e two &s;ections, in his opinion, were di&s;tinct in their nature and object, and no repealing clau&s;e had ever been pa&s;&s;ed, and therefore each part mu&s;t be carried into effect. The 8th &s;ection provided for the removal of the pri&s;oners, but there was not a word about trial in it. By the 7th &s;ection it would appear, that the di&s;trict judge might take the court to Pitt&s;burg if he plea&s;ed; he was not re|&s;trained at all; but there was no &s;uch power given to him re&s;pecting pri&s;oners; he could not take them farther than the neare&s;t pri&s;on of &s;afety. How could the&s;e two &s;ections be reconciled? Why were not the two &s;ections formed upon one principle, if they were &s;o connected as the gentlemen &s;uppo&s;ed? Of what avail would it be to take a court to a place where there was no power of taking the pri&s;oners, who mu&s;t be tried, before that court? But &s;o it might be, if the rea&s;oning which had been given was right. Had not the 5th &s;ection been introduced by the legi&s;lature, then, indeed the whole juri&s;diction would have been removed with it.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the indictments that might be found in Norris town, the court having been held agreeable to the 7th &s;ection of that law, the que&s;tion of preci&s;e di&s;tance being &s;et a&s;ide, undoubtedly they would go to wherever the court would remove. Ina&s;much as ju&s;tice could not be done to the pri&s;oners, and ina&s;much as the former deci|&s;ion prevented the trial being held any where but at the place in which it was begun, he hoped the trials would not be proceeded on.</P>
<P>MR. LEWIS arrived in court, and apologi&s;ed for not being able to attend earlier: he had not &s;ufficiently weighed the motion, he &s;aid, to be able to add any thing to the ground ably argued by his col|league, and therefore wi&s;hed to leave it to the deci&s;ion of the court.</P>
<P>JUDGE WASHINTON &s;aid, nothing was more clear than that the fifth and &s;eventh &s;ections of the Quarrantine Law were, for different purpo&s;es: the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th only relates to the removal of pri&s;oners, that they might not fall a prey to any contagious di&s;ea&s;e that might occur where&s;oever they may be confined; and this removal was not for the &s;ake of trial, but for &s;afe keeping. It was doubtful, previous to the pa&s;&s;ing of this act, whether the mar&s;hals had power to remove them, whatever might be the cau&s;e, or however dangerous to them to re|main in pri&s;on; but again&s;t this doubt and danger, Congre&s;s provided. The 7th &s;ection applies altogether to the removal of the court for the purpo&s;e of trial of cau&s;es, both criminal and civil. But all the acts that have been mentioned may be reconciled together, and all with the con&s;ti|tution. The count, without any re&s;triction as to the place of its &s;e&s;&s;ion, if a contagious di&s;ea&s;e &s;hall occur, are to be convened for the purpo&s;e of trying cau&s;es at the &s;tated &s;e&s;&s;ion; and, it is to be remembered, that this is not a new, nor a &s;pecial court, but an adjourned &s;tated court, merely removed from one &s;pot to another, to be holden there: of cour&s;e, all the trialas pending, and before the court at any former term, are to come on at the <HI>place</HI> &s;o changed; for the court is the &s;ame: the arguments of Mr. Attorney were &s;ound, and need not be repeated.</P>
<P>On the&s;e grounds, the court thought that the trials ought to go on, and therefore the motion was over-ruled.</P>
