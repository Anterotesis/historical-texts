<P>WHOEVER is no entire Stranger in our <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> knows what Animo&s;ities, Di&s;putes and Contentions have ari&s;en, and are &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in the &s;ame; &s;o that it is almo&s;t become a <HI>Me&s;ech.</HI> May the Love of Truth, con&s;train me to a&s;cribe them unto their real Cau&s;e! that they who have rai&s;ed, may an&s;wer for them. Our intended College is the Bone of Contention, all will grant: But how it comes to be &s;uch, and who were the In&s;truments of changing and perverting, what was by our A&s;&s;embly intended for a Ble&s;&s;ing, into a Cur&s;e, about that all do not agree: The Ca&s;e to me, notwith&s;tanding, is as plain, as any Thing in Nature can be; and will be evident, I believe to all, who open their Eyes to the Light of Truth. Were my Neighbour, with whom heretofore I lived in good Harmony, to come to my Hou&s;e, and in a peremptory and in&s;olent Manner, to demand of me &s;omething I e&s;teemed the mo&s;t valuable of all my Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, &s;eizing the &s;ame in the&s;e Words, <Q>Friend, this I mu&s;t have, whether thou wilt let me or not;</Q> And I were to return his Compliment; <Q>What meane&s;t thou, in&s;olent Man? be gone;</Q> And &s;o &s;aying, &s;natch it out of his Hands: And this kind and mannerly Neighbour of mine, thereon to go and alarm the Neighbourhood, complaining of my falling out and breaking with him: Would not the Ca&s;e be plain, my Neighbour behaved like an odd &s;ort of a Man? Or, that I may &s;et off the Ca&s;e yet in a clearer Light: There

once lived two Si&s;ters near by one another, the Name of the one was <HI>Polite&s;&s;a,</HI> and the Name of the other <HI>Prudentia. Polite&s;&s;a,</HI> one Day came to <HI>Prudentia,</HI> and in a gay Air, acco&s;ted her thus; Ah! Lard ble&s;s me, Si&s;ter <HI>Prudentia,</HI> I dont know, what thou intende&s;t to do with thy Children, poor Creatures! I am affraid thou wilt make them all as aukward Prudes as thy &s;elf; they never will be gay, if they &s;tay with thee; let them come to me, I will put them, in the fir&s;t Place, to the dancing School; and next, I &s;hall take Care to learn them all my gay and grand Airs; and that they may the better take them, to be &s;ure, let them never come within thy Hou&s;e, for they would be infected with thy low and mean Demurene&s;s. Nay, I intend to make them &s;uch fine Ladies, that they &s;hall for ever be a&s;hamed to own thee for a Mother: But thou &s;ee&s;t Si&s;ter, how much thou art obliged to me for my Propo&s;al, that I expect thee to pay for the Education of my Children, as well as for thine: Don't look &s;o grave, for do it thou &s;halt; I have already agreed with the dncing Ma&s;ter, to take all of them. Si&s;ter! Si&s;ter! replied <HI>Prudentia,</HI> is it not enough that thou &s;poile&s;t thy own Children; woulde&s;t thou al&s;o do it to mine? No, Si&s;ter, no; that &s;hall never be. Now <HI>Polite&s;&s;a</HI> began to grumble, and &s;cold, upbraiding <HI>Prudentia,</HI> with an un&s;i&s;terly Behaviour: Whereon <HI>Prudentia</HI> withdrew into another Room, and <HI>Polite&s;&s;a</HI> went off in a mighty Bu&s;tle, complaining grievou&s;ly to all &s;he met, how ill <HI>Prudentia</HI> had u&s;ed her; although, at the &s;ame Time, <HI>Prudentia</HI> had the greate&s;t Rea&s;on to complain, I think. Were I not afraid of muliplying too many Similitudes and Compari&s;ons, to illu&s;trate one and the &s;ame Thing, which was &s;elf-evident before, I &s;hould here bring in the Di&s;putes at pre&s;ent &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between us and our Neighbours the <HI>French.</HI> It was in Time of profound Peace, that they began to build Forts on the Lands along the <HI>Ohio;</HI> we thereon are all in Arms, threatning them War: What if the <HI>French</HI> &s;hould call us bad Neighbours, Promoters of War, Strife and Contention; will not, mu&s;t not every rational Per&s;on, a&s;cribe the Cau&s;e of tho&s;e Commotions to them, on Account of their unju&s;t Encroachments on our Borders, and their Endeavours to take from us what is our Property?</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="007456_0004_102DAEAA48B0BB40">Now, if any Man in his right Sen&s;es, who will not be duped, con&s;iders what hath happened among us, will he then any longer be at a Lo&s;s to a&s;cribe our Strifes, Quarrels and Contentions, to their real Cau&s;es? Was there not a Sum of Money rai&s;ed by our A&s;&s;embly, in order to erect a College or Seminary of Learning for the Education of Youth? And did not a certain Party petition for, and obtain a Charter, in which the Pre&s;ident is appointed for ever to be a Member in Communion with the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and for Morning and Evening Wor&s;hip, to be u&s;ed the Liturgy of the Common Prayer Book, or a Collection taken out of the &s;ame, and by far the Majority of Tru&s;tees &s;trenuous Propugnators for the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as by Act of Parliament e&s;tabli&s;hed in South Britain, but not here? And will not our Youth, by this Con&s;titution, be under the &s;ole Government of that Party (as yet not numerous in this Province) and thereby be imbued with their Principles, &s;o that High Church be brought in a likely way to triumph over us? Were a Heathen Emperor, the Subjects of who&s;e Empire were half Heathens and half Chri&s;tians, re&s;olved to make the whole, or by far the major Part embrace Heatheni&s;m, I think he could not fall upon a better Scheme to accompli&s;h his De&s;ign, than to entru&s;t the Education of Youth to Heathens. Should a popi&s;h King, who&s;e Subjects were partly Papi&s;ts, partly Prote&s;tants, take a Re&s;olution to make Popery prevail, what better could he do, than appoint popi&s;h Pre&s;idents and Tutors in the Seminaries of Learning? And is there a Country or Province, in which there are &s;everal Denominations of Prote&s;tants, who&s;e religious Liberties hang in <HI>Equilibrio,</HI> no one by Law e&s;tabli&s;hed above the re&s;t; and were a certain Party a mind to &s;addle and ride the re&s;t; what could they contrive better, or what Stratagem invent more adapted to promote their domineering Sway, than by gra&s;ping to them&s;elves the A&s;cendency, or Superheminence in the College or Seminary of Learning, erected for the General Education of Youth? Will not the Youth be tinctured with the Principles of tho&s;e who teach them? And will this not &s;oon model Church and State?</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="007456_0005_102DAEAC8049BB00">When the&s;e Things are duly con&s;idered (which &s;urely are very obvious to every thinking Per&s;on) I hope they who belong to the Reformed Church, as con&s;tituted by the Synod of <HI>Dordrecht,</HI> will no longer &s;uffer them&s;elves to be &s;o much impo&s;ed upon, as they have been for &s;ome Time of late: For my Part, I am not more amazed, though I am much &s;o, at the a&s;toni&s;hing Impo&s;ition of the incroaching Party, that would monopolize our intended College, than I am at our own Infatuation, Stupidity and Lethargy, in doing &s;o little as hath been hitherto done, in order to a&s;&s;ert and &s;ecure the ine&s;timable Ble&s;&s;ing of Ble&s;&s;ings, by Treaties &s;ecured unto us, and now in Danger of being &s;natched from us all at one fatal Gra&s;p; I mean the Enjoyment of Liberty of Con&s;cience in public Wor&s;hip, and in Church Di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>How in the Name of Wonder, comes it then to pa&s;s, that a pretended Friend of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Church, &s;hould write, as I find he hath done, in the Supplement to the <HI>New-York Mercury</HI> in N^o 140, &s;ub&s;cribed, J. V. D. This Letter writer may &s;tile him&s;elf as much a Well-wi&s;her to his Country, and our <HI>Dutch</HI> E&s;tabli&s;hment, as he plea&s;es; I fear that in his Friend&s;hip there lies a lurking <HI>Serpent,</HI> and if the Ma&s;k was thrown off, he would only be an In&s;trument of that incroaching Party, endeavouring by Inchantment and Artifice, to lull us a&s;leep, while they de&s;poil us of our Churches.</P>
<P>He exclaims, in the fir&s;t Place, bitterly again&s;t the <HI>Independent Reflector</HI> and the <HI>Watch-Tower,</HI> as Pe&s;ts of the Peace of Society; and then &s;ignifies his Surpri&s;e at many of his pretended Brethren of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Church, who countenance tho&s;e Writings, charging them with di&s;turbing the Peace and Tranquility of this Colony; a Charge &s;o ju&s;t, as that wherewith in the Fable, a ravenous Wolf doth accu&s;e an innocent Sheep, that &s;tands below him in the Stream, of having troubled the Waters; which, I think, may be more fully collected from the Similitudes and Compari&s;ons I have drawn above.</P>
<P>With Regard to the <HI>Independent Reflector,</HI> and <HI>Watch-Tower,</HI> (though I am not of his Sect as to Principles in Religion) I believe the Lord in his wi&s;e and gracious Providence, hath
<PB N="7" REF="007456_0006_102DAEAF2F765C30">
been plea&s;ed to u&s;e him as a Means to bafle and fru&s;trate an incroaching Party, in their unju&s;t Demands: Had the <HI>Independent Reflector</HI> and <HI>Watch-Tower,</HI> pro&s;tituted his Pen, in encouraging the unrea&s;onable Pretences of tho&s;e, who now declare him the Bane and Pe&s;t of Society, he had been by them extolled to the very Skies; he had been proclaimed a Wonder, a Prodigy of the World! the happie&s;t Phenomenon of the Age! no lucrative Job, no gratifying Boon in the Province, had been too great for him: But now, while he pleads and vindicates the Cau&s;e of per&s;ecuted Liberty and Rights, they &s;eem to envy him the vital Air he breathes in: May the Lord reward him for it! and I hope, there will yet come a Time, when his Country &s;hall &s;ee, how much they are obliged to him.</P>
<P>In the next Place, our pretended Friend and Well-wi&s;her (I fear &s;uch a one as <HI>Sanballet</HI> the <HI>Horonite, Tobiah</HI> the <HI>Ammonite&s;h</HI> Servant, and <HI>Ga&s;hem</HI> the <HI>Arabian,</HI> were to <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI>) throws a gloomy Glance on our <HI>Dutch</HI> Prie&s;ts educated in <HI>America.</HI> And why mu&s;t they be the Butt of his Indignation? The Ca&s;e is clear; it is becau&s;e, as they under&s;tand a little of the Engli&s;h Language, and &s;ee what Ruin was meditated their Churches, they endeavour to avoid the fatal Stroke, by forming them&s;elves into a Reformed Cla&s;&s;is, according to the Canons of the Synod held at <HI>Dordrecht,</HI> in the Years of our Lord, 1618 and 1619, that they may be capable of acting in a joint Body; which is likely to be of better Con&s;equence, than what is done by &s;ingle <HI>Kerkenraet.</HI> The Nece&s;&s;ity of this, for our Pre&s;ervation, I could ea&s;ily evince by many valid Rea&s;ons; but our Friend, the Letter-Writer, &s;pares me that Labour at pre&s;ent, by his Endeavours to prejudice our Church again&s;t it, being either &s;o ignorant, or &s;o malicious, as to &s;ugge&s;t, that when we &s;et up a Cla&s;&s;is of our own here, we have done with <HI>Holland:</HI> As he &s;tiles the <HI>Cla&s;&s;is of Holland,</HI> it &s;eems as if he knew not that there are many Cla&s;&s;is in <HI>Holland,</HI> and two Synods of the Reformed Church, either of which, no doubt, will be willing to form, con&s;titute and acknowledge us a Cla&s;&s;is: But he &s;eems to be under a terrible Apprehen&s;ion, when this is effected, the <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> College will be
<PB N="8" REF="007456_0007_102DAEB0F15DFC38">
encouraged, and ours at the &s;ame Time neglected: I hope we will wi&s;h the <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> College well, becau&s;e their Aim at gra&s;ping after all our Churches, hath not hitherto been &s;o glaring, as that of the High Church College in this Province; and I believe the religious Principles inculcated in the former, agree better with Holy Scripture, and with the Confe&s;&s;ion of our Church, nay, even with the doctrinal Part of the Articles of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> than I expect will be taught in the latter: Moreover, they who erected it, have not as yet endeavoured to impo&s;e the Charge of keeping it upon us: But if our Friend had not been ha&s;ty, and had waited but a little while longer, he would perhaps have been informed, that we don't chu&s;e to have too near a Connexion with either; but intend, plea&s;e God, an Academy of our own, for the free Education of our Youth (for which their Parents, their Godfathers and Godmothers, even in their Bapti&s;m, did promi&s;e and vow before God and his Saints, they &s;hould be in&s;tructed in the Doctrine of our Reformed Church) And although this our Re&s;olution be but ju&s;t and equitable in it&s;elf, and no more than what is manife&s;tly our indi&s;pen&s;ible Duty, we may notwith&s;tanding, in a great Mea&s;ure, thank our kind Si&s;ter Churches for it, who by the whole of their late Conduct towards us, even by their Dreams and Prophecies, have &s;hewn us the Nece&s;&s;ity thereof, unle&s;s we re&s;olve ignominiou&s;ly, to &s;urrender and give up our Churches to them, and thus in order to aggrandize our Si&s;ters, &s;uffer Annihilation our&s;elves, and perhaps be the Means of putting our Si&s;ters in a fair Way to ruin one another, and to work out the De&s;truction of this whole Land.</P>
<P>As to our fictious Friend's Invention, of a Prote&s;terian Synod; I leave the Gentlemen he has in View, to an&s;wer for them&s;elves; they are of Age, and every Way a Match for him. What a Happine&s;s, that a Man ble&s;t with &s;o lively an Invention, is &s;o &s;incere a Friend to us, in this our oppre&s;&s;ed State, in which &s;harp-ey'd Eagles hover over and about us on every Side! Who knows what admirable Schemes, what un-thought of Projects, he may invent, and bring about for our Good! I wonder &s;o great a

Friend, and &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing a Genius, advi&s;es us &s;till to &s;tick to our old, negligent, ob&s;olete, exploded Plan; by which our Church in <HI>New-York,</HI> is got &s;o much on the declining Hand, that the Grandeur of the High Church con&s;i&s;ts in Pro&s;elytes, gained from her Si&s;ter <HI>Low Dutch Church.</HI> It is po&s;&s;ible this our Friend may be one of tho&s;e, who plume them&s;elves on having prejudiced our Church in <HI>New-York,</HI> again&s;t calling a Reformed Mini&s;ter to preach in Engli&s;h, becau&s;e we were in Danger of one of the Prote&s;terian Sect. But what of that? It left us ju&s;t where we were, all in the Dumps! and &s;till the Nece&s;&s;ity appears, that a Mini&s;ter of our own Order, &s;hould preach in Engli&s;h in our Churches, to prevent the falling off from us, &s;uch as do not under&s;tand <HI>Dutch</HI> (which if not prevented, mu&s;t inevitably, in a little while, prove our Ruin) and why doth our Friend not &s;hew us the Way, how we may do this &s;afely? I pretend not to &s;uch Inventions as he; and yet I can ea&s;ily do it. Our Junior Mini&s;ter is a known Orator, and as he has the Latin, may &s;oon learn Engli&s;h &s;ufficient to begin with to preach; he will, when once begun, improve very fa&s;t, or may not young <HI>Dordracen&s;is,</HI> be called thereunto? Why don't our <HI>Kerkenraet</HI> de&s;ire him to do it? We have already our Catechi&s;m and Liturgy tran&s;lated in Engli&s;h among&s;t us; and as I am informed, may have from <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> even the P&s;alms of <HI>David</HI> tran&s;lated in that Language, adapted to the Metre and Mu&s;ic of <HI>Petrus Dathenus,</HI> which we u&s;e. This Scheme, I fear, will be propo&s;ed and approved of, la&s;t of all by our Friend and his Party; they will &s;ooner advi&s;e a Church of <HI>England</HI> Mini&s;ter, to go on as he doth, to preach <HI>Low Dutch</HI> in the <HI>Mohawk</HI>'s Country, pre&s;&s;ing on after the laborious Steps of his Predece&s;&s;or, who did the &s;ame in the City of <HI>Albany.</HI></P>
<P>In regard to the true Specimen among our People, of one of our <HI>Dutch</HI> Mini&s;ters, late of <HI>Long-I&s;land,</HI> but now of <HI>Bergen,</HI> in the <HI>Jer&s;eys,</HI> I mu&s;t remark, that <HI>Jehu</HI>'s Words to <HI>Joram,</HI> are very applicable; <HI>What Peace &s;o long as the Whoredoms of thy Mother</HI> Jezebel, <HI>and her Witchcrafts are &s;o many?</HI> As al&s;o are the Words of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord to his Di&s;ciples; <HI>Think not that I came to &s;end Peace on Earth: I came not to &s;end Peace, but a Sword.

The <HI>Diabolians,</HI> in their Turn, attacked him fiercely, and called into their Aid and Succour, &s;ome of his carnal Brethren, who plotted his Ruin, and were in a likely Way to effect it, had not the Eyes of the Cla&s;&s;is of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> been opened, by a fair and candid Repre&s;entation of the Ca&s;e. And this true Specimen &s;hews us the Nece&s;&s;ity of our being formed into a Cla&s;&s;is here, that the Enemies of experimental Religion, may not have it in their Power, by their fal&s;e and malicious Glo&s;&s;es and Mi&s;repre&s;entations, before the Cla&s;&s;is of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> to hurt the Promoters of real Piety and Godline&s;s.&mdash;Whence came tho&s;e Quarrels of a different Nature on <HI>Long-I&s;land,</HI> in former Times?

Oh! this mock E&s;tabli&s;hment is a Darling of theirs to enchant and delude the Ignorant and Unweary!

Were I to give my Opinion, how we ought at pre&s;ent to conduct our&s;elves, it &s;hould be this Maxim; whatever any incroaching Party advi&s;es us to do, let us &s;ay Nothing, but not do it: Whatever they advi&s;e us not to do, let us &s;ay Nothing, but do it: If we take the Contrary of their Advice, I dare &s;ay, in the Main, we will do well by it. I know they will &s;et up a hedious Cry, a Huen-Cry, when they perceive this; but we mu&s;t not mind that neither. As it is now a Time in which we exert our&s;elves, to oppo&s;e, re&s;i&s;t, and repell our unju&s;tly incroaching Neighbours, the <HI>French</HI> and their Indians, let us con&s;ider, our God requires of us al&s;o, to make a Stand for our mo&s;t holy Religion, the Truth, as it is in <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> the Lord our Righteou&s;ne&s;s: And for the Peace of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> for <HI>Sion</HI>'s Pro&s;|perity, and for the Safety of our Land, we ought to watch and pray, to labour and &s;uffer, and remain &s;teadfa&s;t in the Faith once delivered unto the Saints. And this is the Exhortation of your true Friend.</P>
