<HEAD>I. <HI>INTRODUCTION:</HI> Containing a true State of the Matters judged upon by the late <HI>Con|&s;ociation,</HI> from their Ri&s;e until laid before that venerable Body.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the time of my fir&s;t &s;ettling with the people in <HI>We&s;t-Stafford,</HI> (which was October 31, 1764) until the year 1778, I lived as happily with them as any Mini&s;ter upon the Continent with his people, perhaps: I loved the people, and to &s;erve their be&s;t intere&s;t in public and private, in &s;ickne&s;s and health, was my delightful employ; while I received, in return, many te&s;timonies of their cordial and &s;incere regard to me, and for the truth's &s;ake which I preached unto them; which, in many in&s;tances, appeared to have a good effect upon them: On which ac|count I had rea&s;on to rejoice that I had not
<PB N="6" REF="016775_0005_0F9E23E7E7A70FE0">
run in vain, nor laboured in vain among them.</P>
<P>In 1778 my &s;alary, which according to agreement was &s;ixty pounds lawful money annually, by the depreciation of Continental money, was become almo&s;t nothing; &s;o that I found my&s;elf obliged to a&s;k for &s;ome al|lowance to be made me. In March 1778, a meeting of the &s;ociety was called to &s;ee if they would afford me any help. At this time tho&s;e who were betru&s;ted with the prudenti|als of the &s;ociety were chiefly &s;trangers, new|ly come to re&s;ide in the place, and by ren|dering them&s;elves popular had got into places of tru&s;t: An error this in the people which I would caution all other &s;ocieties again&s;t. The Committee oppo&s;ed any thing's being done for me in a pari&s;h way; that which they chiefly urged, was that it would op|pre&s;s the poor, &amp;c.&mdash;The &s;ociety, which had been u&s;ed to peace before, &s;eemed much &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee a fire kindled; and to put out the &s;ame, a number of the principal in|habitants propo&s;ed to me, at the time of the meeting, to accept of a &s;ub&s;cription for that year, to which I con&s;ented in ca&s;e it were adequate; to bring this about they de&s;ired an adjournment of the meeting, which was granted. At the adjourned meeting I &s;ignified my acceptance of what was &s;ub&s;cribed, and &s;o the difficulty &s;eemed to &s;ub&s;ide for the pre|&s;ent.
<PB N="7" REF="016775_0006_0F9E23E8950FB558">
Neverthele&s;s I could often hear of the Committee's telling one and another, that it was unrea&s;onable to allow me any more than the nominal &s;um, and whatever they did more was over and above their contract with me; that they were under no obligation to do it, and the like. Towards the clo&s;e of this year, the Committee, without being de|&s;ired by me, came to my hou&s;e and told me, they under&s;tood that I was unea&s;y with my &s;a|lary and wanted &s;ome help from the people; and as there would be bu&s;ine&s;s enough on the annual meeting without that, they thought it be&s;t, if I was willing, to have a meeting called on purpo&s;e to &s;ettle the matter relative to my &s;alary. I told them I was willing if they tho't be&s;t, and had mentioned it to one of them &s;ome time before, that I had thoughts of de&s;iring an interview with the Committee; they then a&s;ked me, what my reque&s;t was? I told them that they knew the whole affair as well as I, a bare &s;upport was all I a&s;ked for; I was willing to bear an equal part of the burdens of the pre&s;ent day, and would give up one quarter of my &s;alary, if the pari&s;h would make the re&s;t good, giving me forty-five pounds as good as it u&s;ed to be. One of them, upon this, a&s;ked me how I would have the warn|ing drawn? I told him that it was not my bu&s;ine&s;s to make warnings, they knowing the affair, were quite able to do that. Another
<PB N="8" REF="016775_0007_0F9E23E960CB10B8">
&s;poke and &s;aid, we mu&s;t warn the &s;ociety to come together, to &s;ee what addition they would make to the &s;alary. I told them I thought it not proper to talk of addition to the &s;alary, when I offered to give up one quarter of it. They told me that &s;ixty pounds was &s;ixty pounds, and if the &s;ociety paid that, they fulfilled their agreement with me, and if they allowed me any more it would be by way of addition. I a&s;ked them, if they thought &s;ixty pounds Continental money was equivalent to the &s;ociety's agreement with me? They told me they thought it was: and two of them &s;aid they &s;hould never hold up their hands for my having any more, and added that they believed that the greater part of the pari&s;h was of their minds: The other &s;aid, it did not belong to them to determine the matter, the pari&s;h might do as they &s;aw fit. I told them that if the &s;ociety was of their minds, I &s;hould be glad to know it, that I might know what to do, and accord|ingly de&s;ired a meeting; they therefore warn|ed a meeting to &s;ee what the &s;ociety would <HI>add</HI> to my &s;alary. I wrote to the &s;ociety, which was read in the meeting, &s;hewing them that I did not want an addition, but was willing to give up a quarter part, as I had told the Committee: The event was that the &s;ociety refu&s;ed to act upon the warning. The annual meeting &s;oon came; the &s;ociety dropped the&s;e
<PB N="9" REF="016775_0008_0F9E23EA18CB32D0">
men, and put in a new Committee; at which they appeared extremely offended both with me and the people: And now they began to fault my preaching, and to form a party in the pari&s;h. No &s;tone was left unturned to di&s;affect all they could influence towards my preaching; and whatever I &s;aid in pub|lic was perverted and condemned as heretical and damnable. One of them left the com|munion. A few days after, being at my hou&s;e, I a&s;ked him the rea&s;on of his conduct in withdrawing from communion? He told me it was owing to his being offended with me and the church: I a&s;ked what we had done to offend him? He told me that I preached doctrines he thought were fal&s;e, and the Church received them. I told him he was wrong in leaving the communion until he had given me and the church notice of his unea&s;ine&s;s and endeavoured to &s;et us right, if wrong; and would never be ju&s;tified in do|ing as he had, and read to him &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in Cambridge Platform, which he profe&s;&s;ed to like, and which condemned &s;uch practice. He then told me he had done nothing with|out advice from a neighbouring <HI>Clergyman,</HI> who told him he could not be blamed for leaving the communion when he plea&s;ed. I di&s;cour&s;ed with him two &s;everal times, and laboured to convince him of his error; but all was in vain, he &s;upported him&s;elf upon
<PB N="10" REF="016775_0009_0F9E23EAD3328530">
the advice of this <HI>Clergyman,</HI> but refu&s;ed to tell me his name, though I have &s;ince di&s;|covered who the <HI>Clergyman</HI> is; he lives in a neighbouring town, and was a <HI>member of the late Con&s;ociation.</HI> This delinquent member, neverthele&s;s, has had the <HI>audacity</HI> to deny that I ever faulted him for withdrawing from communion. In June la&s;t the <HI>A&s;&s;ociation</HI> &s;et at my hou&s;e, a few days before which <HI>Solomon Bixby</HI> brought a paper to me containing ten <HI>articles</HI> of <HI>charge</HI> again&s;t my doctrines, which he &s;aid he intended to lay before the <HI>A&s;&s;ociation,</HI> de&s;iring me to read the &s;ame, and &s;ay whether I owned them or not; I read them, and ob&s;erved to him that they were generally fal&s;e as they lay in the charge, and not one of them expre&s;&s;ed as I had expre&s;&s;|ed my&s;elf upon tho&s;e matters: He then de|&s;ired me to draw a complaint my&s;elf, that I would be willing to own, as he depended upon me for proof; I told him, I was will|ing to do it, but had not time then. The A&s;&s;ociation met, and he appeared and pre&s;ent|ed his complaint as he had &s;hown it me be|fore, without any &s;igners but him&s;elf, though in behalf of others: Upon the <HI>A&s;&s;ociation</HI>'s in&s;i&s;ting that the others referred to &s;hould &s;ub&s;cribe &s;aid complaint with him, he pro|cured three others, viz. <HI>Samuel Fuller, Ze|phaniah Alden,</HI> and <HI>Benjamin Ellis.</HI> The <HI>A&s;&s;ociation</HI> a&s;ked me whether I owned the
<PB N="11" REF="016775_0010_0F9E23EE16400B80">
charge? I told them that in general it was wrong, but that there were &s;ome things &s;o near the truth, that I thought it would be di&s;honourable to deny them. I was then de&s;ired to point out what I owned; I did &s;o, which were four of the articles. The <HI>A&s;&s;ocia|tion</HI> then went into the con&s;ideration of what &s;hould be done; I told them that I &s;uppo&s;|ed they had no cognizance of the ca&s;e&mdash;one of the members told me I was mi&s;taken, and added, "I had a <HI>hint</HI> of this, and therefore put the Platform in my pocket," and taking it out read a pa&s;&s;age about here&s;y, &amp;c.&mdash;I told him I had not the &s;ame notions of he|re&s;y that he had: Another replied, <HI>"why all error is here&s;y:"</HI> I then concluded to leave them to proceed as they plea&s;ed without making any oppo&s;ition at that time. They &s;oon re&s;olved upon a committee to meet on future time to confer on matters, and pro|po&s;ed the &s;ame to me; I told them that as I had been publicly accu&s;ed, I cho&s;e to de|fend my&s;elf in public, &s;hould therefore choo&s;e that the <HI>Con&s;ociation</HI> be convoked if they judged the matter cognizable by them; but that was declined: I then told them that I would not conver&s;e with the committee, but if they de&s;ired it, would &s;end them, in writ|ing, a defence of what I owned of &s;aid charge. Accordingly the Committee was ap|pointed to meet at the Rev. Mr. <HI>Perry</HI>'s, Sep|tember

The <HI>A&s;&s;ociation</HI> ad|vi&s;ing a convocation of the <HI>Con&s;ociation,</HI> let|ters were accordingly i&s;&s;ued out for that pur|po&s;e, and their &s;e&s;&s;ion appointed to be the fir&s;t Tue&s;day in November, at the hou&s;e of <HI>Ebenezer Gay</HI> at <HI>Stafford.</HI> A few days before the &s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;aid <HI>Con&s;ociation,</HI> I re|ceived an open paper informing me of the <HI>approach</HI> of that <HI>venerable</HI> body to hear and pa&s;s judgment on my creed, and <HI>requiring</HI> me to appear before them, &s;igned "<HI>Theodore Hin&s;dale, Charles Backus,</HI> members of <HI>Con|&s;ociation.</HI>" On the day appointed about one half the Con&s;ociation met at the time and place.</P>

<P>AS &s;oon as the Con&s;ociation was opened I de&s;ired, and with great difficulty at length obtained, leave to read them a paper, in which I denied their juri&s;diction and right to judge on articles of faith, or make a creed for me; reminded them that the divine di&s;|plea&s;ure had been always te&s;tified again&s;t

&s;candalous immorality; nor did I ever imagine that you was warranted by the con|&s;titution of Connecticut churches to deny Chri&s;tian fellow&s;hip on any other accounts. Your Platform, if I can under&s;tand it, gives you no &s;uch right, but forbids any &s;uch thing. Confe&s;&s;ion of faith, chap. xxi. &s;ect. 2. Preface p. 6. This right of private judg|ment and deci&s;ion, both you and your Plat|form acknowledge. Now Chri&s;t hath ne|ver given individuals, nor churches, any right or privilege, the con&s;cientious u&s;e of which will unavoidably &s;ubject them to the inconveniences and hard&s;hips attending a denial of Chri&s;tian fellow&s;hip and commu|nion: For then it would follow, that a man, by his fidelity to Chri&s;t, would, by Chri&s;t's rules, be debarred the communion of Chri&s;tians! Indeed we &s;hall never act right, nor according to the mind of Chri&s;t in the&s;e matters, until we determine not to withdraw communion from any individual, or Church, except they either believe or act contrary to expre&s;s &s;cripture, <HI>i. e.</HI> are heretical or im|moral.

The la&s;t clau&s;e of their an&s;wer is, 'We only claim, as pa&s;tors and churches, the &s;ame rights with re&s;pect to you.' What do the&s;e words 'with re&s;pect to you,' refer to?

A &s;ole right in one man does not, as I know of, have any re&s;pect to a &s;ole right in any other man. But there is nothing about communion of fellow&s;hip in the que&s;tion.

For this rea&s;on, among others, the paper is now made public. What is in the text only was read to Con&s;ociation; the notes and quotations in them have been added &s;ince, as a confirmation of the &s;entiment; or at lea&s;t to &s;hew that, if the author errs in &s;entiment, he does not err <HI>alone,</HI> but in com|pany, and in very re&s;pectable company too.</P>

<P>Will <HI>Americans,</HI> true and genuine &s;ons of the fair Godde&s;s Liberty; who have been for &s;everal years, and &s;till are, &s;truggling with all the horrors of war, facing the blazing cannon, encountering namele&s;s perils, diffi|culties, dangers and deaths, to e&s;tabli&s;h her on the throne of the&s;e United States, and confirm her &s;alutiferous, balmy regency in this land: Will the&s;e, I a&s;k, &s;ub&s;cribe creeds, articles of faith, and confe&s;&s;ionals, drawn up and impo&s;ed on them by the clergy and ec|cle&s;ia&s;tick councils and &s;ynods! Will they, who neither fled nor &s;ubmitted at the roar of cannon, and the &s;ound of martial arms in the day of battle, be terrified and awed into &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion by the banele&s;s and innoxious thunder of the vatican! Gentlemen, I cer|tainly do not mean to &s;peak diminutively of the clergy, or of eccle&s;ia&s;tical conventions: But I affim, that no clergyman, or number of clergymen, or eccle&s;ia&s;tick council, of whatever denomination, have right to make religious creeds, canons, or articles of faith, and impo&s;e them on any man, or church, on earth, requiring &s;ub&s;cription to them.</P>
<P>As an evidence, yea, a demon&s;tration of the negative of this que&s;tion, let it be ob&s;erv|ed, that the bu&s;ine&s;s of creed-making never did any good in the church, never promot|ed

the truth, or &s;uppre&s;&s;ed <HI>here&s;y;</HI> but al|ways, without exception, had the contrary effect.</P>
<P>Some of the peculiar tenets of <HI>Arius</HI> were e&s;teemed by the Emperor <HI>Con&s;tantine the Great,</HI> and &s;ome part of the Chri&s;tian church, perhaps, heretical and dangerous. Upon this <HI>letters mi&s;&s;ive</HI> were i&s;&s;ued out by the <HI>mode|rator</HI> of the fir&s;t general eccle&s;ia&s;tick council, <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> to the bi&s;hops of the &s;everal provinces of the empire, to meet at <HI>Nice</HI> in <HI>Bythinia,</HI> A.

Accordingly great numbers of the bi&s;hops convened together at time and place, with great <HI>punctuality, gravi|ty</HI> and <HI>&s;olemnity!</HI> The ful&s;om encomiums given this augu&s;t and venerable a&s;&s;embly of bi&s;hops, pre&s;byters, deacons, &amp;c. by &s;ome partial hi&s;torians of the court-party of that day, I &s;hall never undertake to repeat: But only to enquire what good this convention did, and whether they &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the <HI>Arian here&s;y,</HI> and prevented the ri&s;ing of others, or not? And I know not that I can do this better than by reciting the words of Pre&s;ident <HI>Dicki&s;on</HI> concerning this council, as I find him quoted. "The &s;ynod of <HI>Nice</HI> did in|deed impo&s;e &s;ub&s;criptions; but what was the con&s;equence, but horrible &s;chi&s;ms, convul&s;i|ons and confu&s;ions, until the church was crumbled into parts and parties, each uncha|ritably anathematizing one another?

The <HI>Arians</HI> were not only &s;trengthened in their <HI>here&s;y,</HI> and increa&s;ed in their num|bers by their per&s;ecution; but there was quickly added to them the black catalogue of <HI>Eu&s;tathians, Macedonians, Anomoioi, Euno|mians, Photinians, Luciferians, Anthropomor|phites, Apollonirians, Dimeritae, Ma&s;&s;iliani, Antidicomorianitae, Collyridiani, Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">angi&s;|monitae, P&s;athirians, Eutychians, Seleuciani, Patriciani,</HI> with a long and almo&s;t endle&s;s <HI>et caetera.</HI> All which <HI>here&s;ies</HI> ro&s;e out of the bottomle&s;s pit, in about &s;eventy years &s;pace, in the &s;ame church.

This was the mark &s;et by providence upon the fir&s;t &s;ub|&s;cription of this kind, that was ever impo&s;ed in the world; and this the defence and pro|pagation that followed from it. The churches of <HI>New-England</HI> have all continued from their fir&s;t foundation non-&s;ub&s;cribers; and yet retain their fir&s;t faith and love. From all this I think, it naturally follows, that &s;ub|&s;cription is not nece&s;&s;ary for the being, or well-being of the church; unle&s;s hatred, variance, emulation, wrath, &s;trife, &s;editions and here|&s;ies

<P>The council of <HI>Nice,</HI> the fir&s;t oecumenical or general council, condemned the religious tenets and &s;entiments of <HI>Arius,</HI> A. D. 325. Prodigious trou|bles immediately aro&s;e. Some held with the council, others with <HI>Arius.</HI> A. D. 330, <HI>Arius</HI> was recalled from bani&s;hment by <HI>Con&s;tantine the Great;</HI> and the &s;evere laws again&s;t him were repealed. <HI>Athana&s;ius,</HI> one of the mo&s;t violent again&s;t <HI>Arius,</HI> in the <HI>Nicene</HI> council, was, in his turn, bani&s;h|ed into <HI>Gaul,</HI> A. D. 335, by the council of <HI>Tyre.</HI> Then the Arian party flouri&s;hed again. The people of Alexandria refu&s;ed to admit Arius to communion. Con&s;tantine commands Alexander the bi&s;hop of <HI>Con&s;tantino|ple</HI> to admit him to the communion. After the death of Con&s;tantine the Great, Con&s;tantius held with the Arians: Con&s;tantine and Con&s;tans Em|perors of the We&s;t, with the council of <HI>Nice.</HI> Hence aro&s;e endle&s;s animo|&s;ities and &s;editions, treacherous plots, and open acts of inju&s;tice and violence between the two contending parties, the Arians and Nicenians. Council was a&s;&s;embled after council, council again&s;t council, and their jarring and contradictory decrees &s;pread perplexity and confu&s;ion throughout the whole Chri&s;tian world. Con&s;tans was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, A. D. 350. A great part of the we&s;tern empire, particularly <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> fell &s;oon into the hands of his brother Con&s;tantius. This change was extremely unfavourable to the ad|herents to the decrees of the council of <HI>Nice.</HI> This Emperor's attachment to the Arians induced him to involve their adver&s;aries in countle&s;s troubles and mi&s;eries. He compelled great numbers to embrace Ariani&s;m; among others <HI>Liberius</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI> Pontiff, A. D. 357. The <HI>Nicene</HI> party meditat|ed repri&s;als, and waited only a fit opportunity, &amp;c. to avenge them&s;elves. In|deed the hi&s;tory of the church, during the reign of Con&s;tantius, pre&s;ents the reader with a perpetual &s;cene of tumult and violence, and the deplorable &s;pec|tacle of a war carried on between brothers, without religion, ju&s;tice or hu|manity, on account of their differing &s;entiments in religion! The death of Con&s;tantius, A. D. 362, changed con&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">derably the face of religious affairs, and dimini&s;hed greatly the &s;trength and influence of the Arian party. <HI>Julian</HI> be&s;towed his favours and protection on neither &s;ide.&mdash;<HI>Jovian,</HI> his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, favoured the <HI>Nicene</HI> doctrine&mdash;and immediately the whole we&s;t, with a con&s;iderable part of the ea&s;tern empire, changed &s;ides, conformed to the de|crees of the council of <HI>Nice,</HI> and abjured the Arian &s;y&s;tem. A good evi|dence that this religious controver&s;y was e&s;pou&s;ed and carried on from views of religion and con&s;cience!</P>
<P>The &s;cene however &s;oon changed again, when <HI>Valentinian</HI> and his brother <HI>Valens</HI> were rai&s;ed to the empire, A. D. 364. <HI>Valentinian</HI> adhered to the decrees of the <HI>Nicene</HI> council; and hence the whole Arian &s;ect, a few churches only excepted, were de&s;troyed and extirpated in the we&s;t. <HI>Valens,</HI> on the other hand, favoured the Arians; and his zeal for their cau&s;e expo&s;ed their adver&s;aries the <HI>Nicenians,</HI> in the ea&s;tern provinces, to many &s;evere trials and &s;ufferings. The&s;e troubles however ended with the death of this Em|peror, who fell in a battle again&s;t the <HI>Goths,</HI> A. D. 378. He was &s;ucceed|ed by <HI>Gratian,</HI> a friend to the <HI>Nicenians,</HI> and a re&s;torer of their tranquility. <HI>Theodo&s;ius the Great,</HI> however, who &s;ucceeded him, rai&s;ed his terrible vio|lence again&s;t the Arians; and rendered the decrees of the council of <HI>Nice</HI> triumphant over all oppo&s;ition; &s;o that the barbarous nations, the <HI>Burgun|dians, Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandals</HI> were the only profe&s;&s;ors of Ariani&s;m in public, be|cau&s;e not conquered. In this long and &s;hocking conte&s;t between the <HI>Niceni|ans</HI> and Arians, it will be difficult to determine which party mo&s;t exceeded the bounds of probity, charity and moderation. The members of the Arian &s;ect were wretchedly torn into factions, which regarded each other with the bittere&s;t aver&s;ion. The ancient writers make mention of the&s;e under the names of Semi-Arians, Eu&s;ebians, Aetians, Eunomians, Acacians, P&s;athyrians and others.&mdash;The Arian controver&s;y produced new &s;ects, occa&s;i|oned by the indi&s;creet lengths to which the contending parties pu&s;hed their re&s;pective opinions. Many who oppo&s;ed Ariani&s;m ran headlong into &s;y&s;tem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of doctrine as bad or wor&s;e. Others who defended them went further than their chief, and thus fell into errors much more extravagant than tho&s;e he embraced. Hence aro&s;e the Apollinarians, Marcellians, the Photinians, who&s;e leader, Photinus of <HI>Sirmicum,</HI> was cha&s;ti&s;ed not only by the Niceni|ans, in the councils of Antioch <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dr. Lardner &s;ays this council at</HI> Antioch <HI>was held by the</HI> Eu&s;ebians, <HI>or</HI> Arians, <HI>not by the</HI> Orthodox, <HI>or</HI> Nicenians, <HI>as Dr. M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;heim affirms.</HI> Cre|dibility, &amp;c. vol. ix. p. 13.</NOTE> and Milar, in the years 345 and 347, and that at Sirmicum, without date; but by the Arians al&s;o, in an a&s;&s;embly of theirs at Sirmicum, 351. Then Macedonius, bi&s;hop of Con&s;tantinople, aro&s;e, who was &s;ent into exile by the influence of the Eunomians, by the council of Con&s;tantinople, A. D. 381, which is commonly called the &s;econd general or oecumenical council. A great number of other &s;ects aro&s;e in about 70 or 80 years after the fir&s;t Nicene council, though of le&s;s note than tho&s;e mentioned above; all owing their ri&s;e to the corrupt and abominable prac|tice of &s;ub&s;cription, &s;et on foot by that council.</P>
<P>Early in the 5th cent. A. D. 404, the council, overcome by the in por|tunity of St. Augu&s;tin, bi&s;hop of Hipps, were prevailed with to &s;end a depu|tation of their body from Carthage to the Emperor Honorius, reque&s;ting that the laws might be put in force again&s;t the Donati&s;ts, a &s;ect &s;till very numerous. The Emperor was not &s;o forward for per&s;ecuting men on ac|count of their religious tenets as the&s;e <HI>holy fathers;</HI> and therefore only or|dered a fire to be impo&s;ed on tho&s;e of that &s;ect, that would not return in|to the bo&s;om of the church. But it &s;eems his humanity and lenient temper were put to too &s;evere a te&s;t by a &s;econd deputation &s;ent from tho&s;e <HI>follow|ers and imitators of the mesk and lowly Je&s;us,</HI> a&s;&s;embled at Carthage, A. D. 407, importuning him, that the laws made in 405, entitled <HI>acts of unifor|mity</HI> might be put in force and more &s;trictly executed again&s;t the Donati&s;ts. Though this faction of the Donati&s;ts was much broken by the&s;e reiterated &s;hocks; yet it mightily revived again, after the death of Stiticho, who was put to death by the order of Honorius. The gentlene&s;s and humanity of Honorius got the better of his prejudices again, and in 409, he publi&s;hed a law in favour of <HI>liberty</HI> of <HI>con&s;cience,</HI> and prohibited all compul&s;ion in mat|ters of religion. But this law was not of long continuance. What could be the rea&s;on of its di&s;continuance? It was certainly founded upon the &s;ound|e&s;t principles of rea&s;on, policy and religion, and calculated to promote the univer&s;al good both of church and &s;tate. The an&s;wer is obvious, and the rea&s;on of its abolition mo&s;t apparent. It &s;uited not the haughty, a&s;&s;uming, arrogant &s;pirits of the <HI>clergy</HI> of that day, tho&s;e gho&s;tly fathers of the church, who, failing in point of argument, <HI>wanted the civil &s;word to refute their adver&s;aries with!</HI> The earne&s;t and repeated &s;olicitations of near three hun|dred bi&s;hops, met together at Carthage, in 410, prevailed with Honorius the Emperor to repeal and abrogate that good and &s;alutary law! The Tri|bune Marcellin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s was &s;ent by Honorius into Africa, to put an end to this controver&s;y: And here he met 286 Catholic bi&s;hops, and 279 of the Dona|ti&s;ts in council; and held a conference with them of three days, and finally gave &s;entence in favour of the Catholics. The Donati&s;ts appealed to the Emperor, but to no purpo&s;e. This &s;hock almo&s;t ruined the &s;ect for a time. The Donati&s;ts however recovered their former liberty and tranquility, by means of men of more refined &s;entiments of honour, genero&s;ity, humani|ty and religion than the catholic bi&s;hops of that day; viz, the Vandals, a barbarous and &s;avage nation of the north, who, under Gen&s;eric invaded and took the province of Africa from the Romans. But &s;o &s;oon as the Arians had found a &s;ecure retreat among the barbarous Goths, Suevi, Heruli, Van|dals and Burgundians, and had obtained a little power, they per&s;ecuted the Nicenians to as great a decree of &s;everity and inhumanity, as they had been per&s;ecuted by them. Gen&s;eric, and Hunerie his &s;on, the kings of tho&s;e bar|barous nations, pulled down the churches of tho&s;e who held the divinity of Chri&s;t, &s;ent their bi&s;hops into exile, maimed and tortured multitudes that were firm in adherence to their creed. And ju&s;tified their proceedings by the ex|amples which were &s;et them by the Chri&s;tian emperors and bi&s;hops!&mdash;Pre|&s;ently after this aro&s;e the &s;ect of the Ne&s;torians, formed by Ne&s;torius, a Sy|rian, bi&s;hop of Con&s;tantinople, and a di&s;ciple of the celebrated Theodore of Mop&s;ue&s;tia. The council of Nice had not decreed any thing concerning the manner or effect of the union of two natures in the &s;aviour. Hence the bi&s;hops and doctors had, for about 100 years, expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves as they plea&s;ed, concerning the&s;e things. In 428, Ana&s;ta&s;ius declaimed vehement|ly again&s;t giving <HI>Mary</HI> the title, <HI>mother of God,</HI> and &s;aid &s;he ought to be called <HI>mother of Chri&s;t.</HI> Ne&s;torius warmly e&s;pou&s;ed the &s;entiment, and hence the &s;ect&mdash;Cyril, of the &s;ee of Alexandria, took fire, con&s;ulted with Cele&s;tine bi&s;hop of Rome, a&s;&s;embled a council at Alexandria, A. D. 430, and hurled no le&s;s than 12 anethemas at the head of Ne&s;torius. <HI>Here is a controver&s;y now between two bi&s;hops, of the fir&s;t dignity, about a matter too, not of greater importance than the</HI> tithing of mint, ani&s;e and cumin; <HI>yet it was carried on without rea&s;on, moderation, ju&s;tice, religion, or even the lea&s;t &s;hadow of humanity; becau&s;e they would not tolerate each other in different &s;entiments!</HI> After Cyril and Ne&s;torius had reciprocally excommunicated each other, and exa&s;perated each other's &s;pirits to the utmo&s;t, a council was call|ed by Theodo&s;ius the younger, A. D. 431, to be held at Ephe&s;us, <HI>which was the third oecumenical council.</HI> In this council Cyril pre&s;ided, though a party concerned, and an avowed enemy of Ne&s;torius!! Ne&s;torius objected again&s;t the proceedings of the council, as irregular and unju&s;t; but, his remon&s;trances being without effect, he refu&s;ed to comply with the &s;ummons that called him before the council. Cyril, the moderator, pu&s;hed on matters with a lawle&s;s violence, and Ne&s;torius was judged without being heard; and, in the ab&s;ence of a great number of bi&s;hops who belonged to the council, he was compared to the traitor Judas, charged with bla&s;phemy again&s;t the divine Maje&s;ty, de|prived of his epi&s;copal dignity, and &s;ent into exile, where he fini&s;hed his days. The tran&s;actions of this council, &s;ays the hi&s;torian, will appear to the candid and equitable reader in the mo&s;t unfavourable light, as full of low ar|tifice, contrary to all the rules of ju&s;tice, and even de&s;titute of the lea&s;t air of common decency. <HI>May God grant that none of our po&s;terity may ever have occa&s;ion to read the &s;imilar tran&s;actions of an eccle&s;ia&s;tick council in America&punc;</HI> This Ephe&s;ian council, as might be well expected, in&s;tead of healing divi|&s;ions, did but inflame them more and more, and almo&s;t de&s;troyed all hope of re&s;toring concord and tranquillity in the church. John of Antioch, and the other ea&s;tern bi&s;hops, for who&s;e arrival Cyril had refu&s;ed to wait, met at Ephe&s;us, and pronounced again&s;t him and Memnon the bi&s;hop of that ci|ty, who was his creature, as &s;evere a &s;entence at they had thundered again&s;t Ne&s;torius. Hence aro&s;e a new and ob&s;tinate di&s;&s;ention between Cyril and the Orientals, with John the bi&s;hop of Antioch at their head. Notwith|&s;tanding all that was done again&s;t them, the Ne&s;torians, aided mightily by Bar&s;umas, created bi&s;hop of Ni&s;ibi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, A. D. 435, &s;pread their tenets, in this and the following century, through Egypt, Syria, Arabia, India, Tartary and China. A violent aver&s;ion to the Ne&s;torian tenets led many into the op|po&s;ite extreme. This was the ca&s;e with the famous Eutychus, the foun|der of the Eutychians. Who about A. D. 448, was ordered to renounce his error, by the council a&s;&s;embled by Flavianus at Con&s;tantinople. He ob&s;ti|nately refu&s;ed to comply with the decrees of the council, and appealed to a general council. In con&s;equence of which, the Emperor Theodo&s;ius a&s;|&s;embled an <HI>oecumenical council</HI> at Ephe&s;us, A. D. 449, at the head of which he placed Dio&s;corus bi&s;hop of Alexandria, &s;ucce&s;&s;or to Cyril, and a very faithful imitator of his pride, arrogance and fury, and a declared enemy to the bi&s;hop of Con&s;tantinople. Accordingly matters were conducted in this, as they had been in the former Ephe&s;ian council, when Cyril pre&s;ided.

For upon the death of Theode&s;ius, Marcian his &s;ucce&s;&s;or complied with the demand of a general council, made by <HI>Leo the Great</HI> bi&s;hop of Rome. The council was a&s;&s;embled at Chalcedon, A. D. 451. The fourth oecumenical council. Dio|&s;corus was condemned, depo&s;ed, and bani&s;hed into Paphlagoni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, the acts of the council of Ephe&s;us were annulled, the epi&s;tle of Leo, received as a rule of faith; Eutychus, who had been already &s;ent into bani&s;hment and deprived of his &s;acerdotal dignity by the emperor, was now condemned, though ab|&s;ent! The remedies however applied by this council, to heal the wounds of a torn and divided church, proved really wor&s;e than the di&s;ea&s;e. Troubles infinite immediately aro&s;e. To put an end to them, the Emperor Z<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">no, by the advice of Acacius, bi&s;hop of Con&s;tantinople, publi&s;hed, A. D. 482, the famous Henotican, or decree of union, de&s;igned to reconcile the contending parties. This decree repeated and confirmed all that had been enacted in the councils of Nice, Con&s;tantinople, Ephe&s;us, and Chalcedon, again&s;t the Arians, Ne&s;torians, and Eutychians. There were bitter complaints again&s;t the Henoticon, as injurious to the honour and authority of the mo&s;t holy council of Chalcedon. Hence aro&s;e new conte&s;ts and new divi&s;ions, not le&s;s deplorable than tho&s;e which the decree of the union was de&s;igned to &s;up|pre&s;s. It produced new and endle&s;s conte&s;ts both among the Eutychians and the parti&s;ans of the council of Chalcedon. The doctrines of Pelagius were condemned in a council at Carthage, A. D. 412. This controver&s;y was refered by Coele&s;tius and Pelagius to the deci&s;ion of Zo&s;imus the Roman Pontiff, who was rai&s;ed to that &s;ee, A. D. 417. He decided in favour of the monks, and declared them &s;ound in the &s;aith. The African bi&s;hops, with Augu&s;tin at their head, per&s;i&s;ted in their &s;entence. Zo&s;imus yielded to the per&s;everance of the Africans, changed his mind, and condemned, with the utmo&s;t &s;everity, Pelagius and Coele&s;tius, whom he had honoured with his approbation, and covered with his protection! The unhappy di&s;putes about the opinions of Pelagius, occa&s;ioned, as u&s;ually happens, other controver&s;ies equally prejudicial to the peace of the church and the intere&s;ts of true Chri&s;tianity.&mdash;The &s;ects of the Manichean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, Semi Pelagians, Donati&s;te, Arians, Ne&s;torians, Eutychians, Mono<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hy&s;ites, and the&s;e principal &s;ects crumbled into various factions and divi&s;ions, remained in the 6th century.</P>
<P>A fifth oecumenical council was convoked at Con&s;tantinople, by the Em|peror Ju&s;tinian, A. D. 553. In this council the emperor gained his point, and had both the doctrines of Origen and the three chapters condemned. This council, in&s;tead of healing matters by their decrees, made them much wor&s;e, and gave ri&s;e to &s;uch divi&s;ions in the church, as could only be healed by length of time. Many &s;eparated them&s;elves from the communion of the Pope, on this occa&s;ion, and carried their di&s;&s;entions to a tedious and de|&s;tructive length.</P>
<P>The ancient &s;ects remained and were &s;till in the church in the &s;eventh century, and in&s;tead of being &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by the great number of councils of the three proceeding centuries, they were really increa&s;ed and prodigiou&s;ly multiplied thereby.</P>
<P>Though the Greek church was already torn a&s;under by the mo&s;t lamen|table divi&s;ions, yet its calamities were far from being at an end. A new &s;ect aro&s;e, 630, under the reign of Heraclius, which &s;hortly excited &s;uch violent commotions, as engaged the ea&s;tern and we&s;tern churches to unite their forces in order to its extinction. Heraclius having conver&s;ed with one Paul, a man of great credit and influence among the Armenian Monophy&s;ites, and with Athana&s;ius the bi&s;hop of that &s;ect; i&s;&s;ued an edict, A. D. 630, in fa|vour of the doctrine of <HI>one will,</HI> and <HI>one operation</HI> in Chri&s;t. Cyrus, who had been promoted by the emperor to the &s;ee of Alexandria, a&s;&s;embled a council, and got the doctrines of Monotheliti&s;m, introduced by the em|peror's edict, confirmed. This new modification of the doctrine of the coun|cil of Chalcedon, had the de&s;ired effect upon the Monothelites, and induced great numbers of them to return into the bo&s;om of the church. Notwith|&s;tanding this promi&s;ing appearance, there pre&s;ently &s;ucceeded the mo&s;t dread|ful tumults. Sophronius a monk of Pale&s;tine, who was pre&s;ent at the council at Alexandria a&s;&s;embled by Cyrus, in 633, had violently oppo&s;ed the decree of that council confirming the doctrine <HI>of one will.</HI> His oppo&s;ition, though treated by the council with contempt, became formidable the follow|ing year. When rai&s;ed to the patriarchal &s;ee of Jeru&s;alem, he &s;ummoned a council in which the Monothelites were condemned as <HI>hereticks,</HI> who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|vived the Eutychian errors. Sergius the patriarch of Con&s;tantinople inform|ed Honorius, and determined that Pontiff in favour of Monotheliti&s;m. Hence aro&s;e tho&s;e ob&s;tinate conte&s;ts which rent the church into two &s;ects, and the &s;tate into two factions. To put an end to the&s;e factions and com|motions, Heraclius i&s;&s;ued out, in 639, the famous edict compo&s;ed by Sergius, called the <HI>ecthe&s;is,</HI> or expo&s;ition of the faith; in which all controver&s;ies upon the que&s;tion, <HI>whether there was one or two operations in Chri&s;t,</HI> were &s;trict|ly prohibited. A number of the ea&s;tern bi&s;hops a&s;&s;ented to this edict. In the we&s;t the ca&s;e was quite different. John, the 4th Roman Pontiff of that name, a&s;&s;embled a council at Rome in 639, in which the <HI>ecthe&s;is</HI> was rejected, and the Monothelites condemned. Nor was this all; for in the progre&s;s of this conte&s;t, a new edict named <HI>the type,</HI> or <HI>formulary,</HI> was pub|li&s;hed in the year 648, by the emperor Con&s;tans, by the advice of Paul of Con&s;tantinople; by which the <HI>ecthe&s;is</HI> was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. But this did not give content. Martin, bi&s;hop of Rome, in a council a&s;&s;embled at Rome, A. D. 649, con&s;i&s;ting of 105 bi&s;hops, condemned both the <HI>ecthe&s;is</HI> and the <HI>type;</HI> and thundered out the mo&s;t dreadful anathemas <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gain&s;t the Monothe|lites and their patrons, who were &s;olemnly con&s;igned to the devil and his angels! The emperor Con&s;tans highly incen&s;ed at the&s;e haughty proceedings of Martin, who treated the imperial laws with &s;uch contempt, ordered him to be &s;eized and carried into the i&s;land of Naxo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, where he was kept pri&s;oner a whole year. And, for &s;everal years, this unhappy controver&s;y &s;eemes to be extingui&s;hed; but it was a lurking flame, which &s;pread &s;ecretly, and gave the more con&s;iderate rea&s;on to dread new combu&s;tions, both in church and &s;tate. To prevent the&s;e Con&s;tantine Pogonatus, the &s;on of Con&s;tans, pur|&s;uant to the advice of Agatho the Roman Pontiff, &s;ummoned the 6th ge|neral or oecumenical council, A. D. 680, in which be permitted the Mono|thelites and pope Honorius him&s;elf to be &s;olemnly condemned in the pre|&s;ence of the Roman legates, who repre&s;ented Agatho in that a&s;&s;embly, and confirmed the &s;entence pronounced by the council by the &s;anction of penal laws, enacted again&s;t &s;uch as pretended to oppo&s;e it. The Monothelites however continued in the church down to the 12th century. As the two la&s;t councils had decreed nothing concerning eccle&s;ia&s;tick di&s;cipline, nor religious ceremonies; to &s;upply this defect, a new a&s;&s;embly of bi&s;hops was held pur|&s;ue it to the order of J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tinian II, in a &s;pacious hall of the imperial palace, called <HI>Trullus,</HI> i. e. <HI>cupula,</HI> from the form of the building. This council met, A. D. 692, and was called <HI>Quini&s;extum,</HI> being con&s;idered by the Greeks as a &s;upplement to the 5th and 6th general or oecumenical councils.</P>
<P>Thus we have looked through the hi&s;tory of the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th centuries, and the &s;even oecumenical councils; all of which, except the la&s;t, were convened to <HI>judge</HI> of articles of faith, make creeds, form confe&s;&s;ionals, determine the &s;en&s;e of &s;cripture, require &s;ub&s;criptions, and terminate religious controver&s;ies. The con&s;equences of all the&s;e <HI>general councils,</HI> and of every other council which met for the &s;ame purpo&s;es, for 400 years, were con|&s;tantly and invariably the &s;ame, viz the multiplication of errors, the intro|duction of tumults, &s;trifes, divi&s;ions, wrath, emulations, &s;chi&s;ms, convul&s;ions, factions, and a long and namele&s;s train of the mo&s;t de&s;tructive evils and ca|lamities to the Chri&s;tian church. Not a &s;ingle heretick was ever reclaimed, not an error &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, nor one good con&s;equence ever produced, by any one, or by all the&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;tick councils during 400 years. And if we &s;hould trace down the hi&s;tory of the church to the pre&s;ent century, we &s;hall find the &s;ame con&s;equences always and invariably following all eccle&s;ia&s;tick councils, which have ever been holden, to <HI>judge</HI> of articles of faith, make creeds, or com|pare religious tenets with creeds already made, impo&s;e &s;ub&s;criptions, condemn errors, excommunicate or reclaim hereticks, &amp;c. And, as human nature is the &s;ame in all ages, we have the greate&s;t rea&s;on to expect the &s;ame con|&s;equences will follow all councils that &s;hall ever, through divine &s;ufference, be convened for the&s;e purpo&s;es, &s;o long as time &s;hall endure. For it is con|trary to rea&s;on, to the will of Heaven, to all the principles of human liberty and that right which the Deity him&s;elf hath granted to all mankind, to &s;earch, examine and judge for them&s;elves in all matters of religion, that an eccle&s;ia&s;tick council &s;hould ever meet for &s;uch purpo&s;es as above. Indeed it is &s;urpri&s;ing and greatly a&s;toni&s;hing, that any eccle&s;ia&s;tick council &s;hould be guilty of &s;uch bold and daring pre&s;umption as to meet for the purpo&s;es of judging upon articles of faith, making creeds, impo&s;ing &s;ub&s;criptions, con|demning whom they &s;hall be plea&s;ed to call erroneous, <HI>withdrawing com|munion,</HI> &amp;c. after more than 1400 years &s;ad and awful experience of the odi|ous, abominable, de&s;tructive and God-provoking con&s;equences of &s;uch prac|tices! It is impo&s;&s;ible God &s;hould ever manife&s;t his di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t any thing, if he hath not con&s;tantly done it again&s;t &s;uch conduct.</P>
<P>Though I am perfectly &s;atisfied of the truth and ju&s;tne&s;s of the&s;e ob&s;erva|tions, both as concerning the rights of eccle&s;ia&s;tick councils in matters of faith, and the con&s;equences of their pre&s;uming to judge in the&s;e matters, yet I am willing it &s;hould be known that I am not alone in my judgment of the&s;e things. The &s;entiments of an ancient father Greg. Nazian. as I find him quoted by the Di&s;&s;enting Gentleman, p. 141, 142, are, <HI>Sic &s;entio, &s;i verum &s;cribendum e&s;t,</HI> &amp;c. My opinion it this, if I may be allowed to &s;peak the truth; that all <HI>conventions</HI> of bi&s;hops are to be avoided: For I never &s;aw any good come of any <HI>&s;ynod;</HI> nor that it did not much more mi&s;chief, than it hindered. For truth, in &s;uch a&s;&s;emblies, is generally borne down by a &s;pirit of &s;trife and vain glory. The Di&s;&s;enting Gentlemen him&s;elf ob|&s;ervee, p. 258, 259. "Eccle&s;ia&s;tical <HI>&s;ynods,</HI> from the famous <HI>council</HI> of <HI>Nice,</HI> down to the non-famous <HI>convocation</HI> of L&mdash;n, anno 1717, &s;ad experience hath &s;hewn to have been little el&s;e than the pe&s;ts and troublers of mankind; mints where pernicious errors have received the &s;tamp of authori|ty, and been &s;ent out to corrupt the church, and to &s;et the world in flames; and that, for the mo&s;t part, they have been conventions of intere&s;ted, ambitious, factious and angry men, who under a fair pretence of <HI>zeal for the Lord of bo&s;ts,</HI> have been driving furiou&s;ly and foully on in pur&s;uit of worldly views; and with an affectation of being thought <HI>contending earne&s;tly for the faith,</HI> have been only contending, like the di&s;ciples, who &s;hould be <HI>greate&s;t among them&s;elves.</HI>" And, not to &s;well this note to too great a length, whoever will be at the pains of reading the following authors, will certainly find them &s;peak|ing the &s;ame &s;entiments, viz.

<P>The learned and judicious critick, Mr. Poole, gives the &s;ame meaning to the words <HI>here&s;y</HI> and <HI>heretick,</HI> as is above given. Says he, <HI>"E&s;t ergo hic hereticus, is qui per opini|onem,

<P N="2">II. Let us enquire what is the duty of Chri&s;tians concerning an heretick? And when an <HI>heretick</HI> appears in the church, all Chri&s;tians, who &s;ub&s;cribe the Bible as their <HI>only</HI> rule of faith, are bound to avoid him, to turn away from him, and to refu&s;e and for|bid all free and familiar conver&s;ation and in|tercour&s;e with him. They may and ought to treat him very much in the &s;ame manner they would treat an excommunicate. St. <HI>Paul</HI> does not &s;ay excommunicate, but reject him, <HI>paraitou, pa&s;s by him, neglect him;</HI> for this good rea&s;on, that he hath excommuni|cated him&s;elf, by &s;ubverting the foundation of church communion and fellow&s;hip.</P>
<P>And this treatment of the <HI>heretick</HI> is agre|able to the &s;entiment of the learned critick before quoted.

<P>Now we have a fair and ready reply to the que&s;tions before put. 1. Mu&s;t we not
<PB N="47" REF="016775_0046_0F9E241C53DE0388">
endeavour to exterminate here&s;y? Reject, re|fu&s;e it? 2. Can we with a good con&s;cience permit men to profe&s;s or preach here&s;y? In a church that adopts the Bible as her <HI>only</HI> rule of faith, if a man either profe&s;s or preach that &s;he ought to adopt &s;omething el&s;e; for in&s;tance, &s;everal notions and tenets he has formed, in addition to the Bible, as her rule of faith; the church mu&s;t admoni&s;h him a fir&s;t and &s;econd time; if he &s;till per&s;i&s;t in profe&s;&s;ing or preaching his here&s;y, the church mu&s;t refu&s;e, reject and avoid him. 3.

<P>In proof of which I have already ob&s;erv|ed, that no eccle&s;ia&s;tick council of any deno|mination, that hath ever been in the Chri&s;tian church, hath ever done any good, hath ever promoted truth, or &s;uppre&s;&s;ed error; but al|ways the contrary; when ever they have un|dertaken to judge of doctrines for others, or

<P>The truth of this propo&s;ition is al&s;o a na|tural and nece&s;&s;ary inference from the three propo&s;itions ju&s;t premi&s;ed.</P>
<P>The New Te&s;tament every where &s;up|po&s;es all men, both preachers and hearers, <HI>&s;ole</HI> judges, for them&s;elves, with regard to the truth and fal&s;hood of doctrines of religi|on, and their agreement and repugnancy to the unerring &s;tandard.</P>
<P>Now, to an&s;wer the que&s;tion put, Whe|ther there is not &s;uch a thing as fal&s;hood, or fal&s;e doctrine, &s;hort of <HI>here&s;y,</HI> which is not to be endured in our churches?</P>
<P>I doubt not the po&s;&s;ibility of a man's preaching fal&s;e doctrines; doctrines not con|tained either explicitly or implicitly in the Bible; yea, it may be granted po&s;&s;ible, per|haps, that a man may preach things contrary to what is thus contained in the Bible: Not contrary to what is <HI>expre&s;&s;ly</HI> contained in the the Bible, but contrary to what may be there|in implied. Now, if a man preach nothing contrary to any <HI>expre&s;s</HI> propo&s;ition of the Bible, though he may often deliver things repugnant to what is implied therein; yet, &s;o long as his church, the people of his charge, are ea&s;y under his mini&s;try, and do not di&s;cern the repugnancy of his doctrines to the Bible; no man, or body of men, no eccle&s;ia&s;tick council, of whatever name, have

any divine right to di&s;turb this wor&s;hipping a&s;&s;embly of Chri&s;tians, by any of their no|tions, opinions or decrees what&s;oever; for the rea&s;ons above given, viz. that the preach|er hath a <HI>&s;ole</HI> right of judging, for him&s;elf, with regard to the truth or fal&s;hood of his doctrines, and their agreement or di&s;agree|ment with the unerring &s;tandard: And that his hearers have al&s;o a <HI>&s;ole</HI> right of judging, for them&s;elves, with regard to the truth or fal&s;hood of the doctrines they hear, and their agreement or di&s;agreement with the unerring &s;tandard.</P>

They would be &s;en&s;ible there was room for hone&s;t minde to be mi&s;led, from what they had read and ob&s;erved them&s;elves; they would know that there is more to be &s;aid on the other &s;ide, than the generality at all dream of; they would be careful how they di&s;couraged learning, by di&s;couraging the enquiries of learned men.

It is always <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed,</HI> that the doctrine of the church you are of, is right; that it is the doctrine of &s;cripture and an|tiquity. And this, every body thinks, he under&s;tands. So that little learning or reading is nece&s;&s;ary, to make any clergyman a judge over the learnede&s;t man alive." Dr <HI>Hare</HI>'s letter to a young clergyman, p. 30, 31. Is it to be pre&s;umed that our modern Con&s;ociations are always compo&s;ed of men <HI>thus qualified to judge!</HI> By the <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tick con&s;titution</HI> of Connecticut, not only laymen, but any men, whom the churches &s;hall choo&s;e, may attend their pa&s;tors, and &s;it in judgment on matters of the greate&s;t con&s;equence; which require the greate&s;t abilities, both natural and acquired; the &s;ounde&s;t judg|ment; the greate&s;t candor and moderation, together with the warme&s;t at|tachment to religion and the real intere&s;ts of manknd! Is it a breach of charity to &s;uppo&s;e, that if Dr. <HI>Hare</HI>'s qualifications were to be required in each member of our Con&s;ociations, before they &s;hould be admitted to judge, that five tenths of their number would be generally excluded? I pre&s;ume that if the&s;e qualifications were to be read at the opening of the &s;e&s;&s;ions, and tho&s;e only were to &s;tay behind as judges, who were thus qualified, the number of judges would be extremely &s;mall. Yet, according to pre&s;ent mea|&s;ures, all who come are admitted to judge, without exception! Mu&s;t we be borne in hand that this is a divine con&s;titution! did it de&s;cend from Heaven, and proceed from a God of infinite wi&s;dom and unbounded goodne&s;s! has it met with the approbation of that immortal lover of man, <HI>Je&s;us</HI> our dear and ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Redeemer,</HI> who, to plant religion in our dark benighted world, clothed him&s;elf in humanity, lived, preached, &s;uffered, bled and died among&s;t men!

If I mu&s;t &s;ubmit to <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tick authority,</HI> and my <HI>religious creed</HI> mu&s;t be <HI>dictated</HI> by men, I will certainly, following the example of the renowned <HI>Chillingworth,</HI> go to <HI>Rome,</HI> where dwell tho&s;e who have a much fairer claim <HI>to infallibility,</HI> than any in our church.

And <HI>Adam</HI> begat a &s;on in his own likene&s;s after his image, not after the image of God, in which we read man was fir&s;t made, <HI>Gen.</HI> i. 27, <HI>"God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him;"</HI> but in his own fallen likene&s;s. <HI>P&s;alm</HI> li. 5, <HI>"Behold I was &s;hapen in iniquity, and in &s;in did my mo|ther conceive me."

<P>ART. V. That our good works are the matter of our ju&s;tification at the Redeemer's bar. Owned and defended. Voted un&s;crip|tural and dangerous. This article, Mr. <HI>Fo&s;|ter</HI> profe&s;&s;es openly to defend, but to us it

appears directly oppo&s;ite to, and &s;ubver&s;ive of the go&s;pel method of &s;alvation. No doctrine is more plainly and frequently taught, as a foundation principle in the holy &s;cripture, than that the believer's ju&s;tification before God, is wholly on account of Chri&s;t's righte|ou&s;ne&s;s. <HI>Rom.</HI> iii. 28. A man is ju&s;tified by faith without the deeds of the law,&mdash;and 20 <HI>"By the deeds of the law there &s;hall no fle&s;h be ju&s;tified in his &s;ight." Titus</HI> iii. 7. <HI>"That being ju&s;tified by his grace we &s;hould be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life." Rom.</HI> v. 19. <HI>"So by the obedience of one &s;hall many be made righteous."</HI> Can any thing be more evident from the&s;e and &s;imilar texts than that the matter of our ju&s;tification before God, is not our own per&s;onal defective obedi|ence, but the all-perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t imputed to us, and received by faith alone. This righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t is the &s;ole and exclu&s;ive ground of our pardon and accep|tance with God, and ju&s;tification at the Re|deemer's bar, <HI>Rom.</HI> x. 4. <HI>"For Chri&s;t is the end of the law for righteou&s;ne&s;s to every one that believeth."</HI>&mdash;Saints in glory are de&s;cribed as having their robes made white in the blood of the lamb. <HI>Rev.</HI> vii. 14.

<P>ART. VII. That the doctrine of particu|lar and per&s;onal election is not known in the word of God. Proved according to charge.

John</HI> vi. 37. <HI>All that the father giveth me &s;hall come to me, and him that cometh to me I will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out.</HI> If Chri&s;t died for all, as much for one as another, then if all do not actually participate of the benefits of his death, and at la&s;t arrive to Heaven, his pur|po&s;e and intention mu&s;t be fru&s;trated.</P>

<P>As the reader has the report before him, I think it needle&s;s to repeat the articles in the following &s;trictures.</P>
<P>ART. I. &amp;c.&mdash;Voted dangerous and con|trary to go&s;pel, according to charge, and di&s;|approved for the following rea&s;on: 'The word of God, &s;ay they, is full and expre&s;s in a&s;&s;erting that men are born into the world with corrupt and depraved natures.'&mdash;Very confidently &s;aid, but where are the&s;e <HI>full</HI> and <HI>expre&s;s</HI> &s;criptures to be found in the word of God? Why, <HI>Gen.</HI> vi. 5, is one; &s;peaking of the wickedne&s;s of man, it is &s;aid, <HI>the imagi|nation of the thoughts of his heart are only evil
<PB N="72" REF="016775_0071_0F9E243A31E963B8">
continually.</HI>&mdash;But what would they infer from the&s;e words? Was the wickedne&s;s of the antediluvian world referred to in <HI>Gen.</HI> vi. 5, their natural corruption and depravity? If it was then this natural corruption is not univer&s;al, &s;ince <HI>Noah</HI> mu&s;t be excepted who was a ju&s;t man, perfect in his generations and walked with God, &s;ee the 9th ver&s;e: Or was this wickedne&s;s an evidence of their natural cor|ruption? If &s;o, then by parity of rea&s;on <HI>Adam</HI> him&s;elf was naturally, or as he came into exi&s;tence, corrupt, for he eat the forbidden fruit; and the angels, at lea&s;t many of them, were created vicious beings, for they revolted from the <HI>Almighty:</HI> Or, does the evidence of the natural corruption of the human race depend upon the univer&s;ality of the corruption and depravity of mankind referred to? Then certainly <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> were naturally de|praved; for, when they only were exi&s;tent, mankind were &s;urely univer&s;ally depraved and that without any exception; whereas there was one man righteous in the age referred to. Hence it is very apparent that the corruption of mankind in the age referred to, was nei|ther <HI>natural</HI> corruption <HI>it&s;elf,</HI> nor an <HI>evidence</HI> of it. It is the unhappine&s;s of &s;ome Gen|tlemen, that they a&s;cribe to human nature &s;imply as exi&s;ting, what belongs to it only as men have corrupted it by a long cour&s;e of continued impiety: Thus they make all men
<PB N="73" REF="016775_0072_0F9E243ADD21CB50">
children of wrath by nature, from the Apo&s;tle's words to the <HI>Ephe&s;ians,</HI> ii. 2, 3. which evidently relate to their former &s;tate of Heatheni&s;m, when they lived in gro&s;s idolatry and under the government of the prince of darkne&s;s, as the context plainly &s;hows. Is it a ju&s;t and conclu&s;ive method of rea&s;oning, to argue from the &s;tate of human nature, when corrupted by actual &s;ins and rebel|lions, to its &s;tate and condition as it comes into exi&s;tence? Becau&s;e human nature is capable of being viciated, and is in fact viciated, by per&s;onal wickedne&s;s, therefore it is vicious as it proceeds from the fini&s;hing hands of its maker? Becau&s;e the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of a moral wicked agent are evil, therefore the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of one who is not a moral agent, <HI>viz.</HI> an infant, are evil? Becau&s;e the &s;criptures inform of a man, or number of men, who by a con|tinued cour&s;e of wickedne&s;s, had contracted fixed habits of villainy to that degree that all their thoughts and imaginations were evil, &s;hall we take this to be a <HI>full</HI> and <HI>expre&s;s</HI> &s;cripture a&s;&s;ertion that men are born into the world vicious and depraved? If a man in a long cour&s;e of open impiety, is finally left of God to commit murder, and dies on a gibbet, is this an indubitable evidence that he was born into the world a wicked wretch, with a murderous di&s;po&s;ition? It &s;eems &s;o, or <HI>Gen.</HI>

vi. 5. would never have been cited in proof of the &s;tate of mankind by nature, or as they came into the world. If &s;uch rea&s;oning is not to be allowed, then the text cited is not to the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The next &s;cripture cited by the committee as <HI>expre&s;&s;ly</HI> a&s;&s;erting that man is born into the world with a corrupt and vicious nature, is <HI>Job</HI> xiv. 4, <HI>'Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.'</HI> Let the reader only turn his attention to the preceeding ver&s;es of the chapter, and he will find that the cleanne&s;s and uncleanne&s;s referred to in the words as they &s;tand connected with the context, have no reference at all to moral evil, but only and &s;imply to the &s;hortne&s;s, vanity and afflictions of the pre&s;ent life&mdash; that we are liable to many evils in the pre|&s;ent &s;tate; our days are few and trouble|&s;ome, we are cut down like a flower, and flee as a &s;hadow. As parents are frail and mor|tal, &s;o they propagate a frail and mortal na|ture, for nothing can be more perfect than its original: This is <HI>Job</HI>'s rea&s;oning, and the evident de&s;ign of the words: How then is native corruption and viciou&s;ne&s;s expre&s;sly a&s;|&s;erted in the&s;e words, when they have no manner of relation to any &s;uch thing.</P>
<P>The next <HI>full</HI> and <HI>expre&s;s</HI> &s;cripture for na|tural depravity u&s;ed by the <HI>Committee,</HI> is <HI>John</HI> iii. 6. <HI>'That which is born of the Fle&s;h
<PB N="75" REF="016775_0074_0F9E243C93093AE0">
is Fle&s;h.'</HI> i. e. that which is born in the &s;en&s;e <HI>you Nicodemus</HI> &s;peak of, is but a mere man con&s;tituted of body and &s;oul, or the mere con|&s;titution and powers of a man in their natural &s;tate, and &s;o not fit for the vi&s;ion of God be|cau&s;e not holy; therefore our &s;aviour informs him that a different birth was nece&s;&s;ary in order to qualify for the kingdom of God, viz. a &s;piritual one: But not a word is there here about original depravity, or that we are born vicious.</P>
<P>Another <HI>expre&s;s</HI> &s;cripture is <HI>Eph.</HI> ii. 3. which we have mentioned already to have reference to a &s;tate of heatheni&s;m, and needs nothing further &s;aid upon it.</P>
<P>The committee proceed&mdash;"That man de|rives a corrupt nature from <HI>Adam</HI> is abun|dantly plain from <HI>Gen.</HI> v. 3. And <HI>Adam</HI> be|gat a &s;on in his own likene&s;s, after his image; not after the image of God, in which we read man was fir&s;t made, <HI>Gen.</HI> i. 27, <HI>'God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him,'</HI> but in his cor|rupted fallen likene&s;s." Powerful rea&s;oning! <HI>Adam</HI> begat a &s;on in his likene&s;s, and what would they infer from this? So the in|feriour orders of creatures, according to a di|vine e&s;tabli&s;hment, beget their young in their likene&s;s: Is this an evidence of natural viciou&s;ne&s;s? No more, I fancy, is intended by the words, than that <HI>Adam,</HI> as a worker,
<PB N="76" REF="016775_0075_0F9E243EAF4B50A8">
together with God, begat an human rea&s;ona|ble creature, and therefore in his likene&s;s; <HI>i. e.</HI> he begat a man like him&s;elf, having the &s;ame nature that God had given him. That it has no reference to the qualities and pro|pen&s;ities of <HI>Adam</HI>'s mind, or his &s;on's, is evi|dent, unle&s;s minds are propagated as bodies are, by natural generation, and <HI>Adam</HI> was the father of <HI>Seth</HI>'s &s;pirit, as he was of his fle&s;h: And if this be the ca&s;e, I &s;ee not why one moral quality may not be propagated as well as another; holine&s;s as well as &s;in, vir|tue as well as vice; for viciou&s;ne&s;s is no more of the e&s;&s;ence of the mind than virtue. If then minds are propagated in the &s;ame man|ner as bodies are the qualities of the&s;e minds are in like manner propagated, for they are not to be &s;eparated in any given in&s;tance; by con&s;equence an holy mind will propagate an holy mind, and <HI>vice ver&s;a:</HI> In the &s;ame manner that a vicious moral quality may be propogated, in the &s;ame manner a virtuous moral quality may be propogated. If this rea&s;oning be not good, let the fallacy be &s;hewn. But the truth is, moral viciou&s;ne&s;s has its &s;eat in the mind, and the Almighty is the direct and immediate author of the hu|man mind, and therefore &s;tiled in the &s;crip|tures the father of our &s;pirits, <HI>Heb.</HI> xii. 9.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That God is the direct and immediate author of the human mind is a propo&s;ition I &s;hall at pre&s;ent take for granted; when the truth of it is called in que&s;tion and di&s;puted, I &s;tand ready to prove it.</NOTE>
<PB N="77" REF="016775_0076_0F9E243FC90B9CE0">
and &s;aid to form the &s;pirit of man within him, <HI>Zech.</HI> xii. 1. Hence if <HI>Adam</HI>'s &s;on had any vicious qualities in his mind connate with the exi&s;tence of it, God placed them there, from whom his mind immediately derived, which makes the pure and holy God the au|thor and prime &s;ource of all the wickedne&s;s that ever exi&s;ted among the human race: But, <HI>'are not my ways equal?'</HI> &s;aith the Al|mighty. May <HI>he</HI> defend us from &s;uch a <HI>bla&s;phemous imputation!</HI>&mdash;I would here ju&s;t ob&s;erve that the word <HI>own,</HI> which the Com|mittee appear to place the &s;tre&s;s of their rea|&s;oning from <HI>Gen.</HI> v. 3, upon, is not in the original, but &s;upplied by the tran&s;lators, and the text ought to be read thus&mdash;<HI>'And A|dam begat in his likene&s;s, in his image:'</HI> To make it therefore an emphatical word is quite unju&s;tifiable.</P>
<P>From what has already been ob&s;erved, is not this con&s;equence unavoidable, <HI>viz.</HI> that mankind are not corrupt and vicious as they come into the world? It is capable, I think of demon&s;tration that whatever viciou&s;ne&s;s there is in the human mind, as it comes in|to exi&s;tence, mu&s;t proceed from God equally with the mind it&s;elf. Does it not appear vain then for any man to rea&s;on from tho&s;e words <HI>Gen.</HI> v. 3, to prove derived viciou&s;ne&s;s, when agreeable to &s;uch rea&s;oning this viciou&s;|ne&s;s mu&s;t derive immediately from the
<PB N="78" REF="016775_0077_0F9E244062E5A3B8">
deity? Further, are the&s;e Gentlemen of the Committee ab&s;olutely certain that <HI>Adam,</HI> when he begat <HI>Seth,</HI> was not a convert, a truly religious and holy man? He was now 130 years old, and had lived nearly as long under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation; if he ever em|braced the go&s;pel and became a virtuous man, as has been always believed in the church, it is in the highe&s;t degree probable he was now a virtuous and godly man. And if moral pravity may be propagated by natural gene|ration, as the Committee &s;uppo&s;e, why not moral virtue al&s;o? And if moral virtue may be thus propagated, why is it not quite as likely <HI>Seth</HI> was born virtuous as vicious? I think it lies upon the Committee to make it evident that virtue cannot be propagated as well as depravity; or that <HI>Adam,</HI> when he begat <HI>Seth,</HI> was not a virtuous man. Until then I mu&s;t look upon the argument from this text, in favour of the natural viciou&s;ne&s;s of mankind, as ab&s;olutely inconclu&s;ive and prodigiou&s;ly uncharitable.</P>
<P>If the Gentlemen I oppo&s;e will avow the opinion, that minds are capable of divi&s;ion and multiplication, and therefore, like the ani|mal part, are propagated by natural generati|on, they might give a better account of their derived viciou&s;ne&s;s; although in this ca&s;e to impute guilt to the po&s;terity of <HI>Adam,</HI> and pu|ni&s;h them on account of this derived viciou&s;|ne&s;s

would be unju&s;t and unequal, &s;ince it was by virtue of no act or choice of theirs&mdash; to which they had never given their a&s;&s;ent or con&s;ent.</P>
<P>The next &s;cripture they have &s;een fit to produce as <HI>expre&s;s</HI> proof of our being born vicious, is <HI>P&s;alm</HI> li. 5. <HI>'I was &s;hapen in ini|quity, and in &s;in did my mother conceive me.'</HI> The words, agreeable to the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> ought to be rendered&mdash;<HI>'I was born in iniquity, and in &s;in did my mother nur&s;e, or nouri&s;h me,'</HI> which words have no reference, I conceive, to his &s;imple formation in his mother's womb, but import no more than that he was a great &s;inner, early went a&s;tray, and had contracted &s;trong habits of vice. <HI>Job</HI> &s;peaks of guiding the widow from his mother's womb, <HI>Job</HI> xxxi. 18. The wicked are &s;aid to go a&s;tray from the womb, as &s;oon as born, &s;peaking lies, <HI>P&s;alm</HI> lviii. 3, and the hou&s;e of <HI>Jacob</HI> is called a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or from the womb, <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> xlviii. 8. The&s;e &s;criptures are of like import with the words of the P&s;almi&s;t under con&s;i|deration, and intend no more than that they did the&s;e things very early, as &s;oon as capable; not that <HI>Job</HI> guided the widow, the wicked went a&s;tray, and the Jews tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed as &s;oon as born, even in an infant &s;tate, for this was utterly impo&s;&s;ible.

That mortality came into the world, and pa&s;&s;ed upon all men, by <HI>Adam</HI>'s <HI>one</HI> &s;in, is proved from the text: But that mankind derive a corrupt na|ture from <HI>Adam</HI> is not <HI>expre&s;&s;ed</HI> in the text mo&s;t certainly; nor can it be inferred from any expre&s;&s;ion in the text, with the lea&s;t &s;ha|dow of probability, except the la&s;t clau&s;e: And that the Apo&s;tle doth not mean to be literally under&s;tood in this clau&s;e, is undenia|bly evident, unle&s;s he contradicts him&s;elf, which we may not &s;uppo&s;e. He evidently means <HI>&s;uffering</HI> by the word <HI>&s;in, &s;uffered</HI> by <HI>&s;inned,</HI> as is very u&s;ual in the &s;acred writings. Further that St. <HI>Paul</HI> does not mean to af|firm that all mankind &s;inned in <HI>Adam,</HI> is e|vident from this, that he affirms all are liable to death, on account of <HI>Adam</HI>'s &s;in, which

Therefore the ble&s;&s;ing of ju&s;tification was intended for the Gentiles, and be&s;towed on them, as well as on the Jews, and upon the &s;ame ground. The oppo&s;ition therefore the Apo&s;tle makes between faith and work, in the 5th and 6th ver&s;es, is not an oppo&s;ition between faith and work in obedience to the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, as the Committee would feign have it; but between faith and work in obedience to the Jewi&s;h law, to which the Jews were &s;urprizingly attached, and in obe|dience to which they looked for righteou&s;|ne&s;s and life.

If there be an <HI>inability</HI> to holine&s;s, and a <HI>pre|vailing propen&s;ity</HI> to &s;in in the <HI>very nature</HI> of man as <HI>exi&s;ting,</HI> &s;o that he <HI>cannot</HI> will, nor <HI>act</HI> otherwi&s;e, until a <HI>phy&s;ical</HI> exertion of di|vine power upon his mind; I think this <HI>in|ability,</HI> and this <HI>propen&s;ity,</HI> and the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> re&s;ulting herefrom, is, to all <HI>intents</HI> and <HI>pur|po&s;es, natural,</HI> as it &s;prings from his <HI>nature</HI>

Second, Whether an avowal of the affirma|tive does not involve in it this propo&s;ition, viz.

<P>The Committee di&s;claim the notion of God's requiring natural impo&s;&s;ibilities as they are plea&s;ed to call them, yet &s;eem to &s;uppo&s;e that God requires impo&s;&s;ibilities in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, or other, for they go on to &s;ay&mdash;"But at the &s;ame time, mu&s;t believe that man's inability to holine&s;s is &s;uch as fully to ju&s;tify tho&s;e words of our &s;aviour, <HI>John</HI> vi. 44, <HI>'No man can come unto me, except the father which hath &s;ent me draw him.'</HI> And of the Apo&s;tle, <HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 7, <HI>'The carnal mind is not &s;ub|ject to the law of God, neither indeed can be."</HI> But are <HI>impo&s;&s;ibilities</HI> required of us in ei|ther of the&s;e &s;criptures?

and then proceed; "This Con&s;ociation doubt not the &s;ufficiency of the merits of the &s;aviour for the whole world; but it will not hence follow that Chri&s;t died for all intention|ally alike, or that one as much as another is given to Chri&s;t." To &s;ay that the merits of Chri&s;t are &s;ufficient for the redemption and &s;alvation of the whole world, yet that it was the divine purpo&s;e that but a remnant &s;hould be redeemed and &s;aved; and therefore the benefits of our Lord's &s;alutary pa&s;&s;ion, in the divine coun&s;el and de&s;ign, and in the applica|tion of them, are re&s;trained to this remnant, appears to me incon&s;i&s;tent with the diffu&s;ive goodne&s;s and beneficence of the father and friend of men, and not coincident with the character God has &s;een fit to a&s;&s;ume in rela|tion to the human race; as a God who tak|eth no plea&s;ure in the death of him who dieth; who would have all men be &s;aved, &amp;c. and is in effect to &s;ay, that Chri&s;t died no more for the non-elect, or tho&s;e who, even|tually, are not &s;aved, than for the devils them|&s;elves who are re&s;erved in chains, &amp;c.

Chri&s;t's intention to die for all is one thing; his intention to &s;ave all is another thing; what I maintain is, that Chri&s;t, of &s;et purpo&s;e and de&s;ign gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all, and ta&s;ted death for every man, and therefore that his redempti|on is equally extended with the race of man; and this his intention to die for all was ab&s;o|lute; but his intention to &s;ave all, or any, is not ab&s;olute, but conditional; univer&s;al &s;alva|tion, and univer&s;al redemption are very dif|ferent things, the former I deny, the latter I maintain.

Are not the &s;criptures of the Old and New Te&s;tament the only &s;tandard of religious truth? Has not every free and ac|countable creature full and undi&s;turbed right to &s;earch the &s;criptures, judge and be|lieve for him&s;elf?

Is not the very claim of &s;uch authority equally and the &s;ame thing with a claim to infallibility? Has God given to any man, or body of men, authority in matters of faith, to whom he has not given infallibility? Then he has given to a man, or body of men, authority to lead men into error, a right to &s;educe and deceive: But let

it be granted, at pre&s;ent and for argument &s;ake, that there is, and will always continue to be, a body of men upon earth, to whom Chri&s;t has given authority to decide in mat|ters of religious faith, and to who&s;e deci&s;i|ons Chri&s;tians are &s;ubject, and ought to &s;ubmit; I a&s;k, Where &s;hall we find this bo|dy of men?

Is it an eccle&s;ia&s;tical council, or a par|ticular church? Is it any, or all of the&s;e? If all have this authority, then, by virtue of authority derived from Chri&s;t, Chri&s;tianity may be made one thing in one country, and another thing in another country; in <HI>England</HI> it will be Epi&s;copal; in <HI>Scotland</HI> a Pre&s;byterian; in <HI>France</HI> a Popi&s;h; and in <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Con|necticut</HI> it will wear a Calvini&s;tick form: But is Chri&s;t divided?

But I forbear&mdash;It never will be pretended that a <HI>Connecticut</HI> Con&s;ociation is of divine in&s;titution, or is con&s;tituted and ve&s;ted with authority, in matters of faith, by a charter from Heaven: It is intirely a &s;y|nodical in&s;titution, and <HI>Saybrook</HI> Platform is its charter: Whatever authority therefore is claimed and exerci&s;ed by this body of men, by virtue of their in&s;titution and charter, is an authority not known in the New Te&s;ta|ment, and by con&s;equence is a bold u&s;urpa|tion of Chri&s;t's prerogative, and a &s;tepping in|to his throne who is the only lawgiver and king in the church; and every exerci&s;e of &s;uch authority is in fact &s;piritual tyranny, and to be di&s;claimed by all who would &s;tand fa&s;t in the liberty wherewith Je&s;us Chri&s;t has made them free.

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY COUNTRYMEN AND FRIENDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE liberty we plead for, and have a right to expect, is not licentiou&s;ne&s;s, nor a liberty to laugh at and abu&s;e a divine reve|lation; but the principle of equal, impartial liberty to all peaceable members of the civil &s;tate, both preachers and hearers, to &s;earch and examine the &s;acred &s;criptures, and to believe, profe&s;s and preach tho&s;e tenets and doctrines, which appear to them to be agreeable to the &s;criptures, and to reject, with entire and per|fect impunity, any, or all tho&s;e tenets and doc|trines, by whom&s;oever they are received or taught, as do not appear to them to be agrea|ble to the &s;criptures.</P>
<P>This notion of liberty was the very princi|ple upon which the glorious Prote&s;tant refor|mation from <HI>Popery</HI> began, proceeded and
<PB N="136" REF="016775_0135_0F9E2E66D3A5BD48">
was finally effected. This is the very princi|ple of religious liberty, for which the Prote&s;t|ant non-conformi&s;ts, our illu&s;trious ance&s;tors in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> contended unto blood, before and during the reigns of the Stuart family: For the enjoyment of this liberty they left their native country, cro&s;&s;ed the Atlantic, and came into <HI>America:</HI> And this is the great and good principle upon which all <HI>New-England</HI> churches were fir&s;t &s;ettled, and upon which they flouri&s;hed for a great number of years. But alas! whither are we their children going! Surely with long and di&s;mal &s;trides we are returning again to <HI>Rome!</HI> For only take away liberty of free enquiry, and free profe&s;&s;ion, in matters of religion and the wor&s;hip of the deity, and <HI>Prote&s;tanti&s;m</HI> is in&s;tantly given up and de|&s;troyed, and <HI>popery</HI> inevitably introduced. And no longer than we hold the principle above, can we po&s;&s;ibly defend the Prote&s;tant cau&s;e, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> our&s;elves in leaving the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> communion. And will you, my country|men, freely and without a &s;truggle, give up that which is your very ba&s;is as Prote&s;t|ants, your birth-right privilege as rea&s;onable, accountable creatures, your divine ornament and glory as Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ors! Will you become bound to believe as this or the other confe&s;&s;ion of faith directs, as this or the other eccle&s;ia&s;tick council &s;hall decree, as this or
<PB N="137" REF="016775_0136_0F9E2E670EDF30A0">
the other mini&s;ter teaches you, though in direct contradiction to the clear dictates of your con&s;ciences, regulated by the word of God! Will you re&s;ign your faith, your con|&s;ciences, and your religion into the hands of any man, or body of men, and delegate them to think, rea&s;on, judge and believe for you? Will you al&s;o appear before the tribu|nal of Chri&s;t, the king of Zion, and your eternal judge, by your delegates too? And will they warrant your &s;afe appearance there? If not, &s;urely it is un&s;afe for you to betru&s;t them now with your faith, your religion, and your con&s;ciences! I fancy I behold a mix|ture of horror, indignation and contempt in your very countenances, upon reading the&s;e queries; to think that a bare motion &s;hould be made for you to re&s;ign every thing &s;acred and important to you on earth, and every thing dear and felicitating in a ble&s;&s;ed im|mortality!

And perhaps you are almo&s;t offended with me for &s;ugge&s;ting &s;uch thoughts to you. But reflect one minute on what you have read above. An eccle&s;ia&s;tick council, gravely met, upon the invitation, not of a pa&s;tor or church, but of three or four di&s;affected individuals, to <HI>judge of articles of faith and doctrines of

Herein you plainly &s;ee, and with your own eyes, the &s;acred liberty of con&s;cience violated, the divine right of private judgment denied, prote&s;tanti&s;m overthrown, infallibility implicitly claimed, a wide door opened for the introduction of popery, and the prerogative of Chri&s;t, the only lawgiver in Zion, boldly a&s;&s;umed! Look again and again upon the doings of that council; con|&s;ider and weigh them well. Open your eyes, rou&s;e up your attention, get your&s;elves quite awake; and do not &s;uffer your&s;elves to be lulled to &s;leep by that vain and fallacious cry, <HI>the church is in danger,</HI> from fal&s;e and corrupt doctrines entering into her.

<P>NOVEMBER 2d, P.

The accu&s;ed pa&s;tor repeatedly a|ro&s;e and reque&s;ted liberty to read a paper he had in his hand, and obtained it finally with great difficulty, being told by &s;everal mem|bers of Con&s;ociation that <HI>Mr. Bli&s;s</HI> was Ad|vocate for the aggrieved, and <HI>mu&s;t</HI> not be <HI>in|terrupted,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Bli&s;s</HI> him&s;elf &s;pake and &s;aid, "We did not come here, Mr. <HI>Fo&s;ter,</HI> to hear you read papers, we came to judge."

<SALUTE>To the Gentlemen members of the church who have &s;igned the within paper, and others whom it may concern,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS may certify that the Rev. Mr. Bli&s;s has not undertaken the office of advo|cate for the complainants again&s;t the Rev. <HI>I&s;aac Fo&s;ter,</HI> nor can with truth be con&s;ider|ed &s;o by any; true it is the complainants de|&s;ired of the council that Mr. Bli&s;s might a&s;&s;i&s;t them in that character; the council gave liberty that he might, and &s;ome of the members of council thence mi&s;takenly con|cluded that he had undertaken; hence aro&s;e your mi&s;take: But the truth is, he did en|tirely decline the office, and accordingly has not been con&s;idered by the council in that character.</P>

<P>This may be affirmed without he&s;itation, that the Rev. Mr. Bli&s;s acted the part of an advocate in public during the whole time of the re&s;idence of Con&s;ociation in <HI>We&s;t-Staf|ford,</HI> and a mo&s;t cen&s;orious, unchri&s;tian, and even inhuman part too; and what the peo|ple complained of, or at lea&s;t one thing they complained of, was, that Mr. Bli&s;s &s;hould act
<PB N="149" REF="016775_0148_0F9E2E77F52F2490">
&s;uch a part, and appear in &s;uch a character in public, and yet deny, or at lea&s;t refu&s;e to own his advocacy for the complainants. If he was advocate they thought the public &s;hould have known it; if he was not, it appeared to them very a&s;toni&s;hing, that a judge &s;hould be &s;uffered to act &s;uch a part, publickly to pre|judge the cau&s;e, and that in the mo&s;t offen|&s;ive, virulent terms. The reply to their complaint informed them, that although it was de&s;ired by the complainants that Mr. Bli&s;s might a&s;&s;i&s;t them in the character of advocate, and that he had liberty &s;o to do from the council; yet he declined the office, and accordingly was not con&s;idered in that character by Con&s;ociation. But how does all this con&s;i&s;t with the public and private voice of <HI>many members</HI> of <HI>their own body, the olde&s;t &s;cribe in particular,</HI> unitedly de|claring that this Mr. Bli&s;s was <HI>advocate for the aggrieved,</HI> that <HI>he was voted advocate by Con&s;ociation,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. all which can be &s;ub|&s;tantially proved whenever there is need of it? Further, if Mr. Bli&s;s declined the office, why did he then publickly execute the of|fice? Why was he &s;uffered to do &s;o by Con|&s;ociation? And why was this given as a rea|&s;on, by &s;everal aged members of the coun|cil, in particular by the olde&s;t &s;cribe, why Mr. Bli&s;s mu&s;t not be interrupted, viz. be|cau&s;e he was advocate for the aggrieved?
<PB N="150" REF="016775_0149_0F9E2E78558E3040">
Mr. Bli&s;s was either advocate, or judge, or both, or neither, if he was advocate, and we rather think he was, from the foregoing te&s;timonies, and that this was what the old|e&s;t &s;cribe was proceeding to acquaint the a&s;|&s;embly with, when broke in upon by Mr. Bli&s;s as related before; if this was the ca&s;e, why all the&s;e contradictions? If he was judge, his public behaviour was in&s;ufferable upon any principles whatever. If he was both, it is a new thing under the &s;un, to make an attorney and judge of the &s;ame per|&s;on, and upon the &s;ame ca&s;e. If the Con&s;o|ciation con&s;idered Mr. Bli&s;s in no character, we are perfectly willing he &s;hould &s;tand for a cypher: But perhaps all the&s;e &s;eeming con|tradictions may be perfectly reconciled by this one con&s;ideration, viz. that he was ap|pointed <HI>advocate for the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> as he declared him&s;elf to be in public; but if he did really act in this character, we think he ought to have executed the office, at lea&s;t, with &s;ome degree of <HI>decency</HI> and <HI>de|corum.</HI></P>
<P>Furthermore, on November 4th, when Con&s;ociation were in the meeting hou&s;e, they promi&s;ed the a&s;&s;embly that they &s;hould have timely notice when their re&s;ult would be publi&s;hed. Nov. 5th a lecture preparato|ry to the holy communion was preached 3 o'clock, P. M. After lecture &s;everal per&s;ons

repaired to the place where Con&s;ociation &s;at, to enquire whether they were like to come to the meeting-hou&s;e that day, and were told by &s;ome of the members of Con&s;ociation that they could not publi&s;h their re&s;ult that night, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or they had not accompli&s;hed their bu&s;ine&s;s; upon which the people went home: Soon after which it was re&s;olved by Con&s;ociation, or at lea&s;t by &s;ome of them, to repair to the meeting-hou&s;e that evening, and read their re&s;ult; and being told that the people were gone home, &s;ome of them replied, that is nothing to us, they might have &s;taid if they would, we mu&s;t not de|lay our bu&s;ine&s;s for the people&mdash;according|ly about &s;un-down they came to the meet|ing-hou&s;e, read their re&s;ult, and then repair|ed to their quarters.</P>
<P>All the above circum&s;tances attending the proceedings of Con&s;ociation at <HI>We&s;t-Stafford</HI> appeared in public, and when occa&s;ion &s;hall require, may be &s;ub&s;tantially authenticated by great numbers of eye and ear wit|ne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> SINCE the late Con&s;ociation at <HI>We&s;t-Stafford</HI> undertook to ju&s;tify their pro|ceedure by quotations from Saybrook agree|ment, it is meet &s;ome <HI>&s;pecial</HI> remarks &s;hould be made upon the&s;e quotations. Among the articles for the admini&s;tration of Church
<PB N="152" REF="016775_0151_0F9E2E79D0BABED0">
di&s;cipline, Art. 3, is the fir&s;t cited by Con|&s;ociation in the following words, "That all ca&s;es of &s;candal that &s;hall fall out within the circuit of any of the afore&s;aid Con&s;ociations, &s;hall be brought to a council of the elders and al&s;o me&s;&s;engers of the churches within &s;aid circuit." It will doubtle&s;s be ob&s;erved by the reader that the Con&s;ociation was conven|ed for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of <HI>judging upon doc|trines &s;aid to be fal&s;e and dangerous,</HI> &amp;c. and that they cited this article to prove they had a right to convene for this purpo&s;e. But perhaps Con&s;ociation meant to found their right upon the &s;criptures referred to in the article. The fir&s;t &s;cripture cited under the article, is 3. John ix 10. <HI>"I wrote unto the Church: But Diotrephes, who loveth to have pre-eminence among them, receiveth us not. Therefore if I come.

And becau&s;e St. <HI>Paul</HI> moved that the chri&s;tians at <HI>Galatia</HI> &s;hould bear one another's burdens, therefore it was an act of kindne&s;s in the Con&s;ociation to make creeds and confe&s;&s;ions for the pa&s;tor and church at <HI>We&s;t Stafford,</HI> and &s;o to ea&s;e them of the burden of making them for them&s;elves!

The next &s;cripture is <HI>Acts</HI> xv. 23. <HI>"And wrote letters by them after this manner, the apo&s;tles, elders and brethren, &s;end greeting unto the brethren which are of the gentiles in Antioch, and Syria, and Cilicia."</HI> Becau&s;e the apo&s;tles, elders and brethren, at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> &s;ent let|ters to the gentile churches in <HI>Antioch, Syria,</HI> and <HI>Celicia;</HI> telling them that they would do well to ab&s;tain from meats offered to idols, from blood, from things &s;trangled, and from fornication, therefore the North Con&s;ociation in the county of <HI>Hartford</HI> had a right to con|demn and excommunicate the pa&s;tor of the church at <HI>We&s;t-Stafford,</HI> if he would not ab|&s;tain from preaching &s;uch doctrines as they judged di&s;agreeable to the go&s;pel.

Hence every one &s;ees that if the Con&s;ociation meant to found their right upon the &s;criptures cited under this article, that right was indi&s;putably proved; for I know no better right than that founded on the bi|ble!!&mdash;The other article cited by Con&s;ocia|tion is the 5th, in the&s;e words, "That when any ca&s;e is orderly brought before any coun|cil of the churches, it &s;hall there be heard and determined, which &s;hall be a final i&s;&s;ue, and all parties therein concerned, &s;hall &s;it down, and be determined thereby." The reader will bear in mind, that the ca&s;e brought before the venerable Con&s;ociation at <HI>We&s;t-Stafford</HI> was denied to be orderly before that body; and that they cite this article to prove that &s;aid ca&s;e was cognizable, and finally to be determined by them.

dangerous doctrines are a ca&s;e that may be orderly brought before a Con&s;ociation, there|fore, as in the other article, they doubtle&s;s meant that the &s;criptures here cited proved this.

<P>I BEG leave to make the following repre|&s;entation, viz When I was ordained in the mini&s;try at <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> I objected again&s;t adopting Saybrook Platform as a model of church-di&s;cipline. But never did I dream of &s;uch an interpretation of that book, as &s;hould warrant any <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tick council</HI> in judging upon articles of <HI>faith,</HI> for any preacher, pro|fe&s;&s;or, or church of chri&s;tians on earth, until the affair of Mr. Sage at We&s;t-Sim&s;bury. And I doubt not it will be ea&s;ily recollected by a number of gentlemen of the Con&s;ocia|tion who were <HI>then</HI> pre&s;ent, that I then made very great oppo&s;ition to any deci&s;ion of Con|&s;ociation in Mr. Sage's disfavour, on account of his <HI>doctrines</HI> or <HI>articles</HI> of <HI>faith;</HI> not be|cau&s;e I was of his opinion in every article, but becau&s;e I con&s;idered Con&s;ociation as hav|ing no authority to judge upon <HI>articles</HI> of <HI>faith,</HI>

to his di&s;advantage, or the di&s;advantage of any man, or body of men, on earth, either from Platform or the word of God. Gen|tlemen, I am con&s;cientiuo&s;ly of the &s;ame mind &s;till. And from the recent experience I have had of what I imagine to be a mi&s;|interpretation of Saybrook Platform, I take this opportunity to &s;ignify my ab&s;olute re|nunciation of that book, as the <HI>rule</HI> of my <HI>faith</HI> or <HI>manners,</HI> &s;o far as it can po&s;&s;ibly be interpreted to &s;ignify a right in any man, or body of men on earth, to judge upon <HI>articles</HI> of <HI>Faith,</HI> not <HI>heretical,</HI> to the lea&s;t di&s;advan|tage of any preacher, profe&s;&s;or, or church of Chri&s;t on earth.

<P>To withdraw chri&s;tian communion and fellow&s;hip from any chri&s;tian preacher or profe&s;&s;or, or from any church of Chri&s;t, on account of differing opinions or &s;entiments in religion, is to &s;ubject that preacher, profe&s;&s;or, or church of Chri&s;t, from whom chri&s;tian communion and fellow&s;hip is withdrawn, to many and great di&s;advantages; it is to de|prive them of all tho&s;e advantages, whatever they may be, which re&s;ult from chri&s;tian communion and fellow&s;hip. Therefore the undeniable and unavoidable inference from the whole argument is this, That it is not
<PB N="164" REF="016775_0163_0F9E2E891BEE5848">
agreeable to the mind of Chri&s;t, that any man, or body of men on earth, or any eccle|&s;ia&s;tick council, of whatever name or <HI>boa&s;ted authority,</HI> &s;hould withdraw chri&s;tian com|munion and fellow&s;hip from any chri&s;tian preacher, profe&s;&s;or or church, on account of differing opinions and &s;entiments in religion.</P>
<P>Again, as the Bible is the chri&s;tian's <HI>only rule of faith,</HI> and as all chri&s;tians have the <HI>&s;acred right</HI> above &s;poken of; no individual chri&s;tian, whether preacher or hearer, has a right to impo&s;e &s;ub&s;cription to any propo&s;ition of religion, not <HI>expre&s;&s;ly</HI> contained in the Bi|ble, on any other individual chri&s;tian, whe|ther preacher or hearer: For as far as any &s;uch right of impo&s;ition takes place, &s;o far the right of private judgment is de&s;troyed. A right in <HI>A</HI> to <HI>judge</HI> for him&s;elf, and to re|ceive or reject any propo&s;ition in religion, not <HI>expre&s;&s;ed</HI> in the Bible, according to the re&s;ult of his own judgment; and a right in B to im|po&s;e &s;ub&s;cription to any propo&s;ition, or any number of propo&s;itions in religion, not ex|pre&s;&s;ly contained in the Bible, on A, cannot po&s;&s;ibly con&s;i&s;t together. A's right is clear|ly and undeniably proved above, and indeed is indi&s;putable among all true prote&s;tants; B, therefore, undoubtedly has no &s;uch right of impo&s;ition. But if B has no right of impo&s;i|tion on A, then he has no right to deprive A of any privilege or advantage what&s;oever,
<PB N="165" REF="016775_0164_0F9E2E8A77DBBA78">
becau&s;e he differs from him, though ever &s;o much, in his belief of any propo&s;itions not expre&s;&s;ed in the Bible. If B therefore with|draws communion from A, becau&s;e A's creed is not the &s;ame with B's, he does what is ab&s;olutely wrong and injurious; he a&s;&s;umes to him&s;elf a right to judge for A, and in &s;o doing denies A's right to judge for him&s;elf, contrary to what is generally acknowledged, and hath been demon&s;trated above. But if B has no &s;uch right of impo&s;ition and depri|vation, &amp;c. as above, then B, C, D, E, F and G, when met together in council, have no right of impo&s;ition on A, or to deprive him of any the lea&s;t privilege or advantage what|&s;oever, becau&s;e he differs from them in re|ligious &s;entiments, and will not renounce his own and &s;ub&s;cribe their creed, or any human creed that can be named, that is not compo&s;ed in the expre&s;s words of holy &s;crip|tures, For the whole right of B, C, D, &amp;c. when met in council, is certainly made up of the <HI>&s;um total</HI> of their individual rights. B has no more right in council, than he had in his &s;ingle capacity; in which &s;ingle capacity he hath ju&s;t been proved to have none at all. But B has as much right as C, or D, or any other member of the council; which is none at all.

<P>Again, let us view this withdrawing com|munion in a point of light a little different from the foregoing. B in&s;i&s;ts upon with|drawing communion from A, becau&s;e A preaches or profe&s;&s;es fal&s;e and dangerous doctrines. A declares what he preaches or profe&s;&s;es, to be the &s;incere dictates of his judgment, regulated by rea&s;on and the Bible. B declares the &s;ame as to his doc|trines and articles of faith. Both A and B have collected their tenets from the &s;ame &s;ources, rea&s;on and the Bible; and in the ex|erci&s;e of the &s;ame <HI>right</HI> of private judgment. A is perfectly willing B &s;hould enjoy all the liberty <HI>he</HI> does; and is not di&s;po&s;ed to give him the lea&s;t di&s;turbance or mole&s;tation
<PB N="167" REF="016775_0166_0F9E2E8BCD7EBA28">
imaginable; but really de&s;irous he &s;hould en|joy all the privileges of chri&s;tian &s;ociety. A is willing to &s;ub&s;cribe the bible as his <HI>only rule of faith;</HI> nor does he preach or hold any one propo&s;ition contrary or repugnant to any <HI>ex|pre&s;s</HI> propo&s;ition of the bible. The whole difference between A and B lies in their dif|ferent interpretations of the holy &s;criptures. But after all their mutual pains and labour to accommodate differences of &s;entiment, they are each of the &s;ame opinion as before. A &s;till retains however his tolerant di&s;po&s;ition to|wards B, and is as willing now as ever that he &s;hould enjoy his own opinions in un|di&s;turbed quiet. <HI>B</HI> is di&s;&s;atisfied and will not exerci&s;e charity and toleration with re&s;pect to <HI>A,</HI> but in&s;i&s;ts upon withdrawing communion from him, and depriving him of the privi|leges of chri&s;tian &s;ociety and fellow&s;hip.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion now is, whether <HI>B</HI> does not treat <HI>A</HI> injuriou&s;ly and deny him the right of private judgment? I am inclined to take the affirmative of this que&s;tion, which may be clearly demon&s;trated thus; <HI>B</HI> can have no right to withdraw chri&s;tian communion and fellow&s;hip from <HI>A,</HI> but on &s;uppo&s;ition of <HI>A</HI>'s having acted wrongs and contrary to the clear dictates or Chri&s;t's religion; and if <HI>B</HI> has no right to withdraw communion from <HI>A,</HI> then in doing it he hath treated him injuriou&s;ly, and denied him the right of private judg|ment.
<PB N="168" REF="016775_0167_0F9E2E8C8F945F70">
The&s;e things will be conceeded by everyone. Now <HI>A</HI>'s wrong and antichri&s;tian conduct hath been this, that he hath careful|ly and impartially &s;earched the holy &s;crip|tures, and con&s;equently embraced certain te|nets and &s;entiments in religion, d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ffering in|deed from tho&s;e of <HI>B,</HI> but &s;uch as he con&s;ci|entiou&s;ly believes to be con&s;i&s;tent with the Bible.

So that <HI>B</HI> cannot withdraw communion from A, on account of A's religious &s;entiments, as being ever &s;o different from his own, with|out treating him injuriou&s;ly, and denying him the right of private judgment.</P>
<P>Here <HI>B</HI> may perhaps &s;ay, I do not mean to deny A's right of private judgment: I only claim the &s;ame right to judge for my|&s;elf, which I willingly allow A to enjoy; <HI>i. e.</HI> a right to judge whether I may, or may

<P>I know this is <HI>B</HI>'s only &s;ubterfuge: But it is a mean, &s;orry &s;hift, make the be&s;t of it!</P>
<P>The fallacy of this ob&s;ervation of <HI>B,</HI> is pal|pable. It is apparently fallacious, from what hath been &s;aid above. I intreat <HI>B</HI> to advert to this one con&s;ideration, viz If he has no right to withdraw communion from <HI>A,</HI> on account of any differing &s;entiments in reli|gious matters, he certainly has no right to judge he has. For no man has a right to judge wrong, Be&s;ides, <HI>B</HI> takes the thing to be proved for granted, <HI>i. e.</HI> that he may with|draw communion from <HI>A</HI> on account of differing &s;entiments in religion. That he may not, I have endeavoured to demon&s;trate above. But further yet, we may ea&s;ily per|ceive the ab&s;urdity of any &s;uch right in <HI>B,</HI> if we only con&s;ider that <HI>B</HI> has no right to with|draw communion from <HI>A,</HI> that <HI>A</HI> hath not to withdraw communion from <HI>B,</HI> on account of differing &s;entiments in religion: For un|doubtedly <HI>B</HI> differs as much from <HI>A,</HI> as <HI>A</HI> doth from <HI>B,</HI> in his religious creed. So that <HI>A</HI> and <HI>B</HI> have equal right to excommu|nicate, on account of difference of &s;entiment.</P>
<P>But what &s;hocking ab&s;urdity is here! and what notorious impeachment of the wi&s;dom

"For when they have determined the holy &s;criptures to be the only foundation of faith, they neverthele&s;s lay down certain propo&s;iti|ons as fundamental, which are not in the &s;criptures; and becau&s;e others will not ac|knowledge tho&s;e additional opinions of theirs, nor build upon them as if they were nece&s;&s;a|ry and fundamental, they therefore make a &s;eparation in the church, either by withdraw|ing them&s;elves from the others, or expelling the others from them. Nor does it &s;ignify any thing for them to &s;ay that their confe&s;|&s;ions and &s;ymbols are agreeable to &s;cripture, and to the analogy of faith. For if they be conceived in the expre&s;s words of &s;cripture, there can be no que&s;tion about them; be|cau&s;e tho&s;e are acknowledged by all chri&s;ti|ans to be of divine in&s;piration, and therefore fundamental.

I know there are &s;ome propo&s;itions &s;o evidently agreeable to &s;cripture, that no body can deny them to be drawn from thence; but about tho&s;e there|fore there can be no difference. This only I &s;ay, that however clearly we may think this or the other doctrine to be deduced from &s;cripture, we ought not therefore to impo&s;e it upon others, as a nece&s;&s;ary article of faith, becau&s;e we believe it to be agreeable to the rule of faith; unle&s;s we would be content al&s;o that other doctrines &s;hould be impo&s;ed upon us in like manner; and that we &s;hould be compelled to receive all the different and contradictory opinions of <HI>Lutherans, Calvin|i&s;ts, Remon&s;trants, Anabapti&s;ts,</HI> other &s;ects, which the contrivers of &s;ymboles, &s;y&s;tems and confe&s;&s;ions are accu&s;tomed to deliver to their followers as genuine and nece&s;&s;ary de|ductions from the holy &s;cripture.</P>

<P>I frankly confe&s;s I &s;ee not why the re|quiring &s;ub&s;cription to any <HI>articles of faith,</HI> framed by men, and not conceived in the words of &s;cripture, as a nece&s;&s;ary prerequi&s;ite of chri&s;tian or mini&s;terial communion and fellow&s;hip, is not an high, implicit impeach|ment both of the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of God. The holy gho&s;t hath certainly ex|plained the articles of chri&s;tian faith, &s;o far as he thought nece&s;&s;ary for all the purpo&s;es of chri&s;tian &s;ociety in this world, and eternal happine&s;s in the world to come. Both the goodne&s;s and wi&s;dom of God would prompt him to do this: Yea, he hath expre&s;&s;ly told us he hath done it, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> iii. 16, 17. Now for men to frame certain tenets and propo&s;iti|ons in religion, according to their own fancy, not conceiving them in any expre&s;&s;ions of holy &s;criptures, and impo&s;e them on others, <HI>as articles of faith,</HI> and require &s;ub&s;cription to them, as nece&s;&s;ary to chri&s;tian communion and fellow&s;hip in this world, or happine&s;s in the next; is certainly to do and require more, in order to chri&s;tian communion in this world, and happine&s;s in the next, than the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of God have ever
<PB N="179" REF="016775_0178_0F9E2E97CAAFA050">
moved him to do and require for the&s;e pur|po&s;es. Either what is done in this bu&s;ine&s;s of creed-making and &s;ub&s;cription by men, is not at all nece&s;&s;ary for chri&s;tian communion here, or happine&s;s hereafter; or el&s;e the wi&s;|dom and goodne&s;s of God have not done all that is nece&s;&s;ary for the&s;e purpo&s;es in the &s;acred &s;criptures. If what men have done, and yet continue to do in this bu&s;ine&s;s of creeds and &s;ub&s;criptions, be unnece&s;&s;ary for the purpo&s;es mentioned above; then, why are creeds compo&s;ed, and &s;ub&s;cription to them required? If this bu&s;ine&s;s of creed-making and &s;ub&s;cription be nece&s;&s;ary; why hath not the wi&s;dom of God di&s;cerned this nece&s;&s;ity? And why hath not his goodne&s;s excited him to provide &s;ome effectual remedy again&s;t the wretched con&s;equences of leaving this bu&s;ine&s;s of creed-making to men? For I make no doubt God hath a &s;ufficient capacity to frame a creed that would be le&s;s exceptionable and more generally &s;ub&s;cribed by chri&s;tians, and with far greater &s;atisfaction, than any creed that hath ever been compo&s;ed by men's hands. And I imagine &s;uch a divine creed, written with the finger of God, though it &s;hould be <HI>impo&s;ed,</HI> and &s;ub&s;cription to it re|quired, would not occa&s;ion &s;uch general un|ea&s;ine&s;s among chri&s;tians, nor be attended with &s;o much complaint and cry of <HI>religious tyranny,</HI> nor be followed with &s;uch dete&s;ta|ble

and pernicious con&s;equences, as have al|ways taken place upon the impo&s;ition of all human creeds without exception.</P>
<P>God him&s;elf te&s;tified, in an awful manner, his high di&s;plea&s;ure at the impo&s;ition of the fir&s;t human creed; that made and impo&s;ed by the <HI>Nicene council,</HI> A. D. 325. And it cannot be &s;hewn from eccle&s;ia&s;tick hi&s;tory that one good con&s;equence ever follow|ed the impo&s;ition of a creed made by men, and not conceived in the expre&s;&s;ions of holy &s;criptures.</P>
<P>But though it be thus demon&s;trably con|trary to rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e, contrary to the &s;criptures, and an high bla&s;phemous impeachment of the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of God, that men &s;hould make and impo&s;e creeds, confe&s;&s;ions of faith, catechi&s;ms, &amp;c. yet creed-mongers will have &s;omething to plead in favour of this bu&s;ine&s;s of creed-making: And I expect nothing more, than that, in con&s;equence of my attempts to &s;et at naught this craft, I &s;hall hear a mighty cry, &s;imilar, it may be, to that St. <HI>Paul</HI> heard at <HI>Athens,</HI> occa&s;ioned by his &s;etting at naught the craft of the &s;ilver&s;miths, who made &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ines for <HI>Diana.</HI> I fancy the bu&s;ine&s;s of creed making is not quite &s;o gainful, e&s;peci|ally in prote&s;tant countries, as was the craft of making &s;hrines for <HI>Diana;</HI> yet as it is &s;o &s;weet and gratifying to men of haughty,

<P>But what will the &s;ticklers for human creeds and confe&s;&s;ions &s;ay?

<P>A little attention to eccle&s;ia&s;tick hi&s;tory

the latter. Why then &s;uch a mighty cry about <HI>orthodoxy</HI> in religion? We never hear of an <HI>orthodox</HI> face, an <HI>orthodox</HI> manner of &s;peaking or writing among&s;t mankind. "It is great pity," &s;ays the author of Remarks upon Pre&s;ident Clap's Hi&s;tory, &amp;c.

<P>As <HI>Saybrook</HI> Platform gives a right to any eccle&s;ia&s;tick council to decide and finally de|termine any cau&s;e what&s;oever, I di&s;&s;ent from it for this rea&s;on, viz. that, as there is no in&s;titution, precept or example of any eccle|&s;ia&s;tick council in the New Te&s;tament; &s;o the whole authority of &s;uch a council mu&s;t be derived from its con&s;tituents, <HI>the parties con|cerned;</HI> and therefore &s;uch a council can have no authority but what is given them to decide any cau&s;e what&s;oever.</P>

How is this? Did the&s;e good men mean to impo&s;e their confe&s;&s;ion of faith upon the people of Connecticut, and ab|&s;olutely to require their &s;ub&s;cription?

<P N="1">I. "That you be immoveably and un|changeably agreed in the only &s;ufficient and invariable rule of religion, which is the holy &s;cripture, the fixed canon, incapable of addition or diminution."</P>
<P N="2">II. "That you be determined by this rule in the whole of religion. That your faith be right and divine, the word of God

<P N="3">III. "That you be well grounded in the firm truths of religion.

<P>Again, in their Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith it&s;elf, Art. X.

<P>The&s;e things being undeniable, how any man, or body of men, &s;hould pre&s;ume to judge for others, as to <HI>articles of faith</HI> and <HI>doc|trines of religion,</HI> and to cen&s;ure and condemn their fellow chri&s;tians, on account of their differing <HI>&s;entiments</HI> and <HI>opinions,</HI> as to the <HI>interpretation</HI> of <HI>holy &s;criptures;</HI> and even <HI>withdraw communion</HI> and <HI>fellow&s;hip</HI> from tho&s;e who differ from them, and deny them many of the advantages of chri&s;tian &s;ociety; or even any advantages what&s;oever; and pre|tend at the &s;ame time a warrant for this conduct from <HI>Saybrook Platform,</HI> and, what is more &s;hocking yet, from the <HI>New Te&s;ta|ment;</HI> mu&s;t be re&s;olved either into their &s;hameful mi&s;interpretation of the Platform and New Te&s;tament both; or their bold and daring pre&s;umption, pride, arrogance, and itch for dominion over others con&s;ciences.</P>

The bible, I &s;ay, the bible only, is the religion of prote&s;tants, what&s;oever el&s;e they believe be&s;ides it: And the plain, irrefragable, and indubitable con&s;equences of it, well may they hold as matters of opinion, but as matters of &s;aith and religion, neither can they with coherence to their own grounds believe it them&s;elves, nor require the belief of it of others, with|out mo&s;t high and &s;chi&s;matical pre&s;umption.

Tradi|tive interpretations of &s;cripture are pretended; but there are few or none to be found. No tradition but only of &s;cripture can derive it|&s;elf from the fountain, but may be plainly proved to be brought in, in &s;uch an age after Chri&s;t, or that in &s;uch an age it was not.
