<P>To the Performance of which he found him&s;elf mea&s;urably prepared and qualified; for his own Experience of the Love of God, and of the Opera|tions of his holy Spirit, in gradually purging out the Corruptions of his own Heart, did excite and aug|ment in him a Chri&s;tian Love to h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">w Crea|tures, attended with an Ardency of Zeal, and an ince&s;&s;ant De&s;ire, for their Conver&s;ion.</P>

<P>Nor doth God &s;end any unclean Me&s;&s;engers on his Errand:</P>
<P>It being the con&s;tant Method of his divine Wi&s;|dom, under this Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation, through the purging of his holy Spirit, to clean&s;e and purify the In&s;ide of every Ve&s;&s;el, which he permits to be made U&s;e of in the Service of his Sanctuary. Where|fore,</P>
<P>Every un&s;anctified Pretender to preach the Go&s;|pel of Chri&s;t, de&s;erves to have his Mouth &s;lept with that unan&s;werable Query of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour to the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> of old; <HI>O Generation of Vipers, low can ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> being evil, &s;peak good Thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> for c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the Abundance of the Heart the Mouth &s;peaketh.</HI> Mat. xii. 34.</P>

A Practice of this Nature abounds with the gro&s;|&s;e&s;t of Ab&s;urdities, and &s;tands emphatically explod|ed, even in the Time of the <HI>Mo&s;aicddeck</HI> Law, by the Royal P&s;almi&s;t, in the&s;e Words: <HI>Unto the Wicked God faith, What ha&s;t thou to do to declare my Statutes, or that thou &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">culde&s;t take my Covenant in thy Mouth?</HI> P&s;alm l. 16.</P>
<P>But alas! <HI>Self-Intere&s;t</HI> prompts Men to turn a deaf Ear even to the mo&s;t divine Expo&s;tulations, and unholy Per&s;ons will, in de&s;pight of the mo&s;t expre&s;s Prohibitions, continue to intrude them&s;elves beyond their Bounds; and will be &s;till bu&s;ying and employ|ing them&s;elves about external Circum&s;tances and Ceremonies, while the L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, Spirit and Sub&s;tance of true Religion is placed above their Reach, and un|attainable by them, until it &s;hall plea&s;e God, in the exceeding Riches of his Grace, to clean&s;e their Heart from all Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s; of which Conver|&s;ion we heartily wi&s;h for a nearer Pro&s;pect than we can di&s;cern at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>We now return to the Author of the en&s;uing Narrative, who was another Sort of Preacher; a free Giver o what him&s;elf had freely received, a liberal and open-hearted Communicator of his re|ligious Experiences unto all other Men, without Re&s;pect of Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>He directed all the Sheep of Chri&s;t to follow the Voice of Chri&s;t him&s;elf, the good Shepherd, who&s;e Omnipre&s;ence readers his Voice audible to every
<PB N="vi" REF="008308_0005_102E87346DA93198">
one of his Sheep, however &s;eparate or di&s;per&s;ed throughout the World.</P>
<P>His Conver&s;ation was free, generous and affable; neither did he &s;hun the Society of tho&s;e whom he was &s;ent to convert; his Mi&s;&s;ion being &s;omewhat corre&s;pondent to that of his Lord and Ma&s;ter, who declared concerning him&s;elf: <HI>I am not come to call the Righteous, but Sinners to Repentance.</HI> Mat. ix 13.</P>
<P>He was of a grave Deportment, and of a tall, comely and manly A&s;pect: His publick Preaching was attended with &s;uch a divine Authority and ma|je&s;tick Innocence, as commanded the Attention of his Hearers; and his Voice being clear, &s;trong and di&s;tinct, was capable of conveying his profitable Ex|hortations to the Ears and Under&s;tandings of a very numerous Auditory; of which a remarkable In|&s;tance appears in his Preaching at <HI>Jedburgh</HI> in <HI>Scot|land,</HI> mentioned in Page 46, 47, of his Account.</P>
<P>His literal Accompli&s;hments were but &s;mall, ex|tending little farther than to enable him to read the Scriptures in his Mother Tongue; yet by con&s;tant U&s;e and Application, he became thoroughly ver&s;ed therein, and enabled by the Force of their Te&s;ti|mony, to confront and confute the Gain-&s;ayers of his Doctrine, which was in all Points &s;trictly agree|able to, and con&s;onant therewith.</P>
<P>In the religious Society to which he was joined, he conducted him&s;elf as a Man of Peace and Pru|dence,
<PB N="vii" REF="008308_0006_102E873718EC4B78">
chu&s;ing to walk in the plain and middle Path, without declining to any Extream; &s;o that he neither idolized Forms, nor contemned <HI>good Order.</HI></P>
<P>His E&s;timation and Repute among his Friends and Neighbours, may appear by the Te&s;timony of the Monthly and Quarterly-meetings of <HI>Bridport</HI> in <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire,</HI> to which he belonged, given forth &s;ince his Decea&s;e, wherein they &s;ay, that <Q>It plea&s;|ed the Lord to endue him with a large Gift in the Mini&s;try, in which he was a faithful La|bourer, and gave him&s;elf up for that Service; that he had a Gift of Utterance &s;uperior to many, &s;ound in Judgment and Doctrine, and very convincing to the Under&s;tandings of tho&s;e that heard him.</Q></P>
<P>This Te&s;timony concerning him is true, and a Man of his Penetration and Capacity could not but di&s;cern his own Improvement in the Gift he had received: Wherefore he &s;tood upon his Guard, le&s;t through Self-love and Conceit, he &s;hould de|part from that Humility, which is the Ornament of every Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter, as in Page 38 he has par|ticularly ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>Which <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Virtue was generally his Conco|mitant, during the Cour&s;e of his Pilgrimage; and is remarkable in the Compo&s;ure of this Account, in keeping it clear from, and un&s;ullied with any the lea&s;t Tincture or Symptom of Self-Applau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="008308_0007_102E8739C34EE4B0">
As in Preaching, his Declarations proceeded from his Heart, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o in Writing his Relations of his Ser|vices, and his Exhortations, &s;prang from the &s;ame Fountain.</P>
<P>Wherefore we recommend to thy &s;erious Con|&s;ideration what he has written, as comprehended in that excellent De&s;cription of a good Men, given by CHRIST him&s;elf, <HI>Luke</HI> vi. 45. <HI>A good Man, out of the good Trea&s;ure of his Heart, bringeth forth that which is good.</HI></P>

<P>AN ACCOUNT OF THE LIFE and TRAVELS OF <HI>SAMUEL BOWNAS.</HI></P>
<P>I Was born in <HI>We&s;tmoreland,</HI> within the Compa&s;s of great <HI>Strickland</HI> Monthly-meeting, about the Year 1676, and was entered in that Regi&s;ter; and my Father dying before I was one Month old, I never knew him, but I have been informed, that he was very hone&s;t and zealous for Truth in his Time, having been a con&s;iderable Sufferer for the Cau&s;e of Religion, both in Lo&s;s of Goods and Liber|ty, the Meeting being kept in his Hou&s;e in &s;ome of the hotte&s;t Time of Per&s;ecution in King <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>Second's</HI> Reign. Being la&s;t &s;o young, and my Mother having but a &s;canty Sub&s;i&s;tance of about 4<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> 10<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> a Year, with a Dwelling for her&s;elf and two Children, I was about Thirteen put to learn the Trade of a <HI>Black&s;mith,</HI> with an Uncle who u&s;ed me unkind|ly; I was afterwards put an Apprentice to a very

hone&s;t Friend belonging to <HI>Brigflatts</HI> Meeting, near <HI>Sedberg,</HI> in <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> his Name was <HI>Samuel Parat;</HI> but all this Time I had no Ta&s;te of Religion, but devoted my&s;elf to Plea&s;ure, as much as my Circum|&s;tances would permit, tho' my Mother had kept me very &s;trict while I was under her Care, and would frequently in Winter Evenings take Opportunities to tell me &s;undry Pa&s;&s;ages of my dear Father's Suffer|ings, admoni&s;hing me &s;till &s;o to live, that I might be worthy to bear the Name of &s;o good a Man's Son, and not bring a Reproach on my&s;elf and Parents; al&s;o frequently putting me in mind, that if &s;he &s;hould be taken away, I &s;hould greatly mi&s;s her, both for Advice and other Ways to a&s;&s;i&s;t me; and advi&s;ed me to fear the Lord now in my Youth, that I might be favoured with his Ble&s;&s;ing; which frequently brought me into great Tenderne&s;s, being afraid that &s;he would die before I was capable to live in the World; and &s;he took me frequently to Meetings with her, where &s;he often had &s;ome Words in Te&s;ti|mony: Per&s;ecution being &s;till very hot, and Friends lock'd out of our Meeting-hou&s;e at <HI>Strickland,</HI> we met at the Door, and I remember at two &s;everal Times when I was a Child, and came to Meeting with my Mother, the Informers came, the fir&s;t Time the Meeting had been over about half an Hour, the &s;econd Time not quite &s;o much, &s;o that we e&s;caped their Hands both Times; but &s;undry Friends were in Pri&s;on at <HI>Appleby</HI> for attending that Meeting, whom my dear Mother went to vi&s;it, taking me a|long with her, and we had a Meeting with the Pri|&s;oners, &s;everal Friends from other Places being like|wi&s;e
<PB N="3" REF="008308_0010_102E8741C80FDF90">
there by Appointment. What I ob&s;erved was, though very young, how tender and broken they were; and I was very inqui&s;itive of my Mother, why they cried &s;o much, (which we called Greeting) and thee greet too, (&s;aid I) why did thee? She told me that I could not under&s;tand the Rea&s;on of it then, but when I grew up more to Man's E&s;tate I might.</P>
<P>Now to return to my Apprentice&s;hip; I had a ve|ry kind loving Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s, and I had Meat enough, and Work enough, but had little Con&s;ider|ation about Religion, nor any Ta&s;te thereof. On <HI>Fir&s;t-days</HI> I frequented Meetings, and the greater Part of my Time I &s;lept, but took no Account of I reaching, nor received any other Benefit than be|ing there kept out of bad Company, which indeed is a very great Service to Youth. I took much Li|berty in Di&s;cour&s;e, and was taken Notice of as a witty, &s;en&s;ible young Man: But often on my Bed I ruminated on my Way of Life with Reluctance, yet frequently fell into the &s;ame Way again: I never was given to Swearing, nor any very gro&s;s Vice, but what I gave way to the mo&s;t, was Je&s;ting, and Turns of Wit to provoke Mirth, which gave me often (af|ter it was over) a heavy Heart; and thus I went on for near three Years; but one <HI>Fir&s;t-day,</HI> being at Meeting, a young Woman, named <HI>Anne Wil&s;on,</HI> was there and preached; &s;he was very zealous, and fix|ing my Eye upon her, &s;he with a great Zeal pointed her Finger at me, uttering the&s;e Words with mach Power, <Q>A traditional <HI>Quaker,</HI> thou come&s;t to Meet|ing as thou went from it (the la&s;t Time) and g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|e&s;t from it as thou came to it, but art no better
<PB N="4" REF="008308_0011_102E87446DAC4A90">
for thy coming, what wilt thou do in the End?</Q> This was &s;o pat to my then Condition, that, like <HI>Saul,</HI> I was &s;mitten to the Ground, as it might be &s;aid, but turning my Thoughts inward, in &s;ecret I cried, <HI>Lord, what &s;hall I do to help it?</HI> And a Voice as it were &s;poke in my Heart &s;aying, <HI>Look unto me and I will help thee!</HI> and I found much Comfort, that made me &s;hed abundance of Tears. Then I remembered what my Mother told me &s;ome Years before, that when I grew up more to Man's E&s;tate, I &s;hould know the Rea&s;on of that Tenderne&s;s and weeping, and &s;o I now did to Purpo&s;e. I went home with a heavy Heart, and could neither eat nor &s;leep as I u&s;ed to do, but my Work never &s;ucceeded bet|ter in my Hands than it did at this Time, nor my Mind never le&s;s in it; but my Conduct, as well as Countenance, was much altered, &s;o that &s;everal in the Family were doubtful that I &s;hould fall into a kind of melancholy Di&s;traction; but I longed for the Meeting-day, and thought it a very long Week. When the Time of Meeting came, my Mind was &s;oon fixed and &s;taid upon God, and I found an un|common Enjoyment that gave me great Satisfaction, my Under&s;tanding being opened, and all the Facul|ties of my Mind &s;o quick, that I &s;eemed another Man; a divine and &s;piritual Sweetne&s;s abiding with me Night and Day, for &s;ome Time, and I began to &s;ee and under&s;tand the Scriptures, and the Na|ture of preaching the Doctrine of the Go&s;pel in the Power and Spirit, plainly &s;eeing a Difference be|tween a Preacher of the Letter and of the Spirit, which till then I was wholly ignorant of, and un|acquainted
<PB N="5" REF="008308_0012_102E8748432B9D70">
with, not having before that, the lea&s;t Degree that I could perceive of divine Under&s;tand|ing; but then upon looking back, and con&s;idering what I had heard &s;uch and &s;uch Friends preach, which at that Time I did not under&s;tand, but now I under&s;tood it clearly, which was a plain Demon|&s;tration to me, that all divine Knowledge is from divine Light, which we can't comprehend, until we are a&s;&s;i&s;ted &s;o to do by a Vi&s;itation from Heaven.</P>
<P>And now the Scriptures, and Mini&s;try from the Openings of the Spirit, &s;eemed &s;o clear and plain to my Under&s;tanding, that I wondered that any Body remained unconvinced, &s;uppo&s;ing them to &s;ee the Truths of the Go&s;pel in the &s;ame Light that I did; and that Saying of the Apo&s;tle, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 John v. 20</NOTE> wherein he a&s;&s;erts his Knowledge of the Son of God being come, from <HI>their receiving an Under&s;tanding from him,</HI> was clear|ly di&s;covered to me, &s;o that now I plainly &s;aw a Di&s;|tinction between the Children of Light, and of this World; the &s;piritual, and the natural Man; and that the natural Man could not receive the Things of the Spirit of God, being Fooli&s;hne&s;s to him; he can't know them, becau&s;e they are known <HI>only by the Spir|it,</HI> as the Apo&s;tle a&s;&s;erts; <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Corinthians ii 14.</NOTE> and I found my&s;elf much improved in divine Wi&s;dom and &s;aving Knowledge. As I was going to Meeting walking alone, it came very livingly into my Mind, that if I was but faith|ful and obedient to the heavenly Vi&s;ion, I &s;hould &s;oon be qualified to teach others, and more e&s;pecial|ly, as I &s;aw by Experience wherein my &s;hortne&s;s had
<PB N="6" REF="008308_0013_102E874B32473740">
been, in being contented and ea&s;y with a Form of Truth and Religion, which I had only by Educa|tion, being brought up in Plainne&s;s of both Habit and Speech; but all this, though very good in its Place, did not make me a <HI>true Chri&s;tian;</HI> I was but a <HI>traditional Quaker,</HI> and that by Education only, and not from the Scriptures, becau&s;e they were a Book &s;ealed to me. And I now &s;aw plainly that Education, though never &s;o carefully admini&s;tred, would not do the Work: although a pious Educa|tion ought by no Means to be neglected, but all Parents and Guardians ought to be &s;tirred up to their Duty in that Re&s;pect; yet we mu&s;t con&s;ider, that it is not in the Power of Parents, or the mo&s;t pious Tutors to confer Grace, which is the Gift of God alone; nor can any come into the true Fold but by <HI>this Door,</HI> as &s;aid our Saviour <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">John x. 1, 2, 3.</NOTE> concerning him&s;elf. Thus it plainly appeared to me, there was no other Way but this, <HI>viz.</HI> by the <HI>Spirit of Chri&s;t alone,</HI> to attain to true Faith, which works by Love, and give Victory over our Infirmities and evil Deeds, working &s;uch a Change in us, that we can in Truth from Experience &s;ay, <HI>we are born from above,</HI><NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">John iii. 3, 4, 5.</NOTE> and by Virtue of that Birth only, is the <HI>true Knowledge</HI> of the Kingdom, and the Things of God <HI>attained,</HI> and by no other Way or Means although never &s;o well contriv'd by human Art: And being experi|mentally &s;en&s;ible of this Change wrought in my Mind, it look'd the more likely that I might in Time be qualified to &s;peak to others of my own Experi|ence
<PB N="7" REF="008308_0014_102E874CB7600680">
of the Operation of the Spirit, in my Mind, not thinking the Time &s;o near at Hand, as it appeared when I came to the Meeting; for I had not &s;at long therein, but a great Weight fell upon me, with &s;ome Words to &s;peak; but I con&s;ider'd, (being wil|ling to be my own Carver) it was too &s;oon to un|dertake &s;uch a Ta&s;k, being hut an In&s;tant in Religion; not remembring the &s;mall Time between <HI>Paul</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Con|ver&s;ion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts ix. 20.</NOTE> and his preaching the Go&s;pel: And my for|mer Conduct with my Companions, (many of whom were in the Meeting at the &s;ame Time) &s;tood much in my Way, for my Reformation was but three Weeks old that very Day, &s;o that I rea&s;on'd thus, <HI>that &s;o &s;udden a Change would hardly be borne:</HI> I could n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> for that Time, for the&s;e Rea&s;ons give up, and the Burden was then taken from me: But after that Meeting it came upon me again with double Weight, and affected me &s;o very greatly that I was much a|lone, and my Countenance &s;o altered with Weep|ing, that my Ma&s;ter took Occa&s;ion to enquire into the Matter, <HI>how it was with me?</HI> And I gave him as plain Account as I was capable of, which he was much affected with indeed, and broke into Tears: What I feared was, that I had by Di&s;obedience &s;o much offended, that I &s;hould be ca&s;t off for ever: But with &s;undry Exhortations from Scripture and o|therwi&s;e, he endeavoured to pacify me, not doubting but that I &s;hould have the like Offer made me, put|ting me in Mind of <HI>Gideon's</HI> Fleece,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Judges vi.</NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> When next Meeting-day came, I went in great Weakne&s;s
<PB N="8" REF="008308_0015_102E874F623D9830">
and Fear, and could rather have gone el&s;ewhere, than to Meeting that Day; however, &s;ome Time after I was in the Meeting, I felt the &s;ame Concern as at the Meeting before, and I &s;at under the Weight of it till the Meeting was a mo&s;t over, and then hardly knew how I got upon my Feet, but did, and broke out with a loud Voice in the&s;e Words, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>Fear not them which kill the Body, but are not able to kill the Soul; but rather fear him which is able to de&s;troy both Body and Soul in Hell. I &s;ay, fear you him who will terribly &s;hake the Earth, that all which is moveable may be &s;haken and removed out of the Way, that that which is immoveable may &s;tand.</Q> This was all I had to &s;ay at that Time. But oh! what Joy and Sweetne&s;s I felt afterward I can't expre&s;s, and the Plea&s;ure of my Mind appeared in my Countenance, &s;o that my Ma&s;ter took Notice, and &s;poke of it &s;o feelingly, that plainly demon&s;trat|ed he was a Partaker with me of the &s;ame Rejoi|cing in him&s;elf, as at the Birth of an only Son: This was about the Year 1696, on that called <HI>Chri&s;tmas-day,</HI> it falling that Year upon the Fir&s;t-day of the Week.</P>
<P>Thus having (as it may be &s;aid,) broke the Ice, the next Time was not quite &s;o hard, but I &s;aid very little, and &s;eldom appeared for a Year or two, having about three Years of my Apprentice&s;hip to &s;erve, which I did with Fidelity and Truth. The la&s;t Year of my Time, I found &s;ome con&s;iderable word|ing in my Mind to vi&s;it <HI>Scotland,</HI> being very rarely without &s;ome Degree of divine Virtue on my Mind, either by Night or Day; therefore I thought, if it was &s;o with me then, it would be much more &s;o
<PB N="9" REF="008308_0016_102E875334337AC8">
when I had nothing to mind but divine Things; but I found it otherwi&s;e, of which in its Place. I may not omit, that &s;ometime above two Years after I fir&s;t &s;poke in Meetings, I open'd the New-Te&s;tament at that Pa&s;&s;age &s;poken of by our Saviour, <HI>Mat.</HI> x. 28. to the &s;ame Effect with what was fir&s;t open'd on my Mind, as mention'd above, which then I knew no|thing of, as being the Sayings of Chri&s;t to warn them again&s;t the Fear of Men; altho' no doubt I had read it, but had taken &s;o little Notice of what I read, it was to me as if it had been never writ.

I was very poor and low at mo&s;t Meetings in that Journey, by rea&s;on but few of the People could well under&s;tand what I &s;aid in &s;undry Places: But <HI>Philip</HI> &s;tood up after I had done, and in part interpreted what I had &s;aid, but I did not &s;eem to be quite ea&s;y in my Mind.</P>

And from <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> Friends an&s;wered, that <HI>With upon Arms they could receive him, believing him to be a &s;in|cere young Man, who intended very well; and they were glad he took their Admonition rights, and had owned it had been of Service to him.</HI> Thus ended this Affair, and <HI>I&s;aac</HI> &s;aid, <HI>he could not think hard of his Brethren in doing what they did, though he could</HI>

<P>When I heard of it, I look it &s;o much to heart, that it was almo&s;t too much for me, and a Concern came upon me to go to <HI>London</HI> with the like Me&s;&s;age, but with this Caution; fir&s;t, to advi&s;e with &s;ome faithful Brethren before I delivered it: And I wrote to <HI>I&s;aac</HI> to let him know it, which gave him great Ea&s;e.

<P>After this I had divers very acceptable Opportuni|ties in <HI>London,</HI> during the Time of the Yearly-meet|ing, and afterwards vi&s;ited Friends towards <HI>Leeds</HI> in <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> and in my Way thither had very agree|able Service in both the Counties of <HI>Leice&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Nottingham,</HI> and at &s;undry other Places.</P>
<P>From <HI>Leeds</HI> I went to the Yearly-meeting at <HI>York,</HI> which was very large, and many public Friends; but I was hid, as it were, and made very little Ap|pearance at that Meeting.</P>
<P>From thence I travelled homewards, vi&s;iting Friends as I went, and was gladly received by them. And I found my Mini&s;try very acceptable; as it in|crea&s;ed upon me, I was very humble and low in Mind, knowing therein my Strength con&s;i&s;ted, and Safety from Temptation.</P>
<P>I was new in a Strait, what Cour&s;e to take to get a little Money; my Linen and Woolen both wanting to be repaired, I met with a young Man newly &s;et up in his Trade, with whom I propo&s;ed to work, and he was ready to comply with my Offer, &s;uppo&s;ing it would be a Means to improve him: So we agreed, and I begun with him, and found it an|&s;wered much better than Harve&s;t-work, &s;o that I &s;tored my&s;elf with a little Ca&s;h &s;oon, and worked hard all that Summer, and in the Fall of the Year prepared my&s;elf for a Journey with my good old Friend <HI>Jo&s;eph Baines.</HI></P>

<P>I Had for my Companion in this Journey, a young Man who had a fine Gift, his Name was <HI>I&s;aac Thomp&s;on:</HI> We vi&s;ited &s;undry Meetings in our Way to <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> finding our Under&s;tandings much en|larged in the Openings of divine Truths, and our Service grew upon us, and we went on with Bold|ne&s;s and chearful Minds, meeting in our Way with our dear and worthy Friend <HI>James Dicken&s;on.</HI> who was intending a Vi&s;it into <HI>Ireland:</HI> And in our Jour|ney from the Border to <HI>Dumfries,</HI> we had very pro|fitable Conver&s;ation of good Service to us both, be|cau&s;e we, by rea&s;on of Youth, and want of Expe|rience, were often very weak, and doubting whe|ther we were right or not in the Work; &s;o that this our dear Friend, by his tender and fatherly Care over us, and Advice to us, was of great En|couragement, in letting us know how weak and poor he often found him&s;elf; which &s;o much an|&s;wered my Condition, that it was as Marrow to my Bones.

When he was clear, we retired back to our Inn, and divers followed us, who were very rude and wicked, but were not permitted to hurt us. We had &s;weet Comfort and Refre&s;hment one in another at our Quarters. Next Morning we took Leave, and parted, he went for <HI>Port-patrick,</HI> and we vi&s;ited the Meet|ings, though very &s;mall, until we came to <HI>Hamilton,</HI> where we were finely refre&s;hed with a &s;mall Hand|fulof living Friends; and &s;o to <HI>Glo&s;gow,</HI> where the People were rude, but &s;omething better than in Times pa&s;t, not being &s;o uncivil to us in the Streets; thence to <HI>Kinneel, Lithgew,</HI> and &s;o over the Water on our Journey Northward, taking <HI>Borough&s;towne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Ury</HI> in our Way to <HI>Aberdeen</HI> Quarterly-meet|ing, where we found Friend; in a &s;weet Frame of Spirit, being in dear Unity one with another.

<P>By this Time the Day was much &s;pent, and con|cluding to &s;tay that Night, we ordered &s;ome Refre&s;h|ment to be got for us, for I found my&s;elf in want of it: It was &s;oon got ready, and we invited our Ho&s;t to &s;hare with us, who willingly did, the &s;hewing his good liking to what had been &s;aid; adding, he never &s;aw the People &s;o &s;truck, and give &s;o good Attention; nor ever did he &s;ee &s;o large a Multitude that heard all &s;o intelligibly down to the very Foot of the Hill, which was, as he &s;uppo&s;ed, not much le&s;s than Two Hundred Yards in length, and I took, by Computation, the Street to be upwards of Thirty Yards wide, and all that Space much crowd|ed.

he had a very large Room, into which we went, and they &s;oon came to us, and quickly fell into Conver&s;ation (for they are very full of Talk about Religion, and very tenacious in their Opinions upon it.) The fir&s;t Article of Di&s;pute was, about <HI>the Rule of Faith and Practice;</HI> and this was argued (<HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con</HI>) between them and our Guide <HI>Samuel Robin&s;on,</HI> near Half an Hour, who was a very &s;en|&s;ible religious young Man, and had a good Share of Learning al&s;o; but I found they made nothing of it. Our Opponents would endeavour, in their Way, to make out the <HI>Scriptures</HI> to be the only Rule of Faith, and that the <HI>Spirit</HI> we profe&s;&s;ed to be guided by, mu&s;t be <HI>&s;ubordinate</HI> to the Text. I hitherto had &s;aid nothing, but now de&s;iring a few Words by way of Que&s;tion, the an&s;wering of which might bring this Di&s;pute to a Point; <HI>I thought not,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>that I &s;hould take the Argument from my Friend</HI> Robin&s;on, <HI>whom I take to be more capable to &s;upport it than I am.</HI> All were very willing to hear me; then I began to &s;tate the Difference between us, thus: <HI>We all agree,</HI> &s;aid I, <HI>that the</HI> Scriptures <HI>is a Rule of Faith and Practice: Do we not?</HI> this was granted. <HI>The Difference lies here then, if I take it right, we &s;ay it's</HI> a Rule; <HI>you &s;ay, it's the</HI> only Rule; <HI>this is the Point in Di&s;pute, is it not?</HI> this was likewi&s;e granted me.

<P>I &s;taid there two Weeks at lea&s;t, and taking my Leave, &s;undry Friends brought me on my Way to <HI>Bath, Bradford,</HI> &amp;c. They returned, and I went on for <HI>London,</HI> and quartering at an Inn at <HI>Hunger|ford,</HI> (not being ea&s;y to take any more Meetings till I came to <HI>London</HI>) I fell in Company with a couple of Trade&s;men, who, when we &s;at down to Supper, complimented each other about which &s;hould <HI>crave a Ble&s;&s;ing,</HI> at la&s;t they pulled off their Hats, and one of them did it in &s;ome &s;ort; but my &s;itting with my Hat on was &s;uch an Offence, that they began to reprove me very &s;harply: I &s;aid but very little for &s;ome Time, until they had &s;pent their Reproach upon me, and then I &s;poke to this Effect, <Q>That the Appearance they made, ju&s;t before Sup|per was brought to the Table, was &s;o very void of Grace in their Hearts, that I could not think it my Place to pull oft my Hat to their formal Prayer: And be&s;ides, as &s;oon as the Words were out of their Mouths and over, it appeared to me that they were the &s;ame, and I &s;aw by their Con|duct that they did not under&s;tand the Nature of
<PB N="63" REF="008308_0070_102E87E319854F58">
<HI>true Prayer,</HI> which is to be performed both with the Spirit and Under&s;tanding; and if you had not wanted both, you could not pa&s;s &s;uch &s;illy Com|pliments on each other about it.</Q> I was now very quiet, and they &s;aid no more to me. But as &s;oon as Supper was over, and the Reckoning paid, they left me with free Con&s;ent, for our Company was un&s;uitable.</P>
<P>Next Day I went towards <HI>London</HI> by <HI>Newbury,</HI> where I &s;topt at a Funeral, and &s;o to <HI>Reading,</HI> and by <HI>Maidenhead</HI> to the City, but found the Embargo not yet taken off. It being now pretty near the Middle of the <HI>Fir&s;t Month,</HI> I vi&s;ited &s;ome Parts of <HI>Hertford&s;hire,</HI> having my dear Friend <HI>John Tomp|kins</HI> part of the Time, and <HI>Samuel Cri&s;p,</HI> who was a &s;weet Companion, having received the Knowledge of the Truth the right Way.</P>
<P>About a Week or two in the <HI>Second Month,</HI> Orders were given for the Merchants to get ready, and a Convoy was to go with them: But for all this, it was the latter End of the <HI>Third Month</HI> before we got off; &s;o I had an Opportunity to vi&s;it the greate&s;t Part of <HI>Kent.</HI> And after we &s;ailed from the <HI>Downs,</HI> we were put into <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> Harbour by contrary Winds, and lay there two or three Weeks, which was very tire&s;ome. But all this Time I never con|&s;idered any Danger of being taken by the <HI>French;</HI> it did not &s;o much as enter into my Mind, until I came into <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> where hearing that <HI>Thomas Story, Richard Groves,</HI> and others, were taken &s;ome Time before, and carried into <HI>Martinico,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> I&s;land, I thought of it more clo&s;ely.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dearly beloved Brethen and Si&s;ters,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN that Love which in Time pa&s;t we have enjoyed together, do I heartily &s;alute you, having in mind &s;ome few Things to impart, as Coun&s;el and Caution to us all, including my&s;elf therein.</P>
<P>We who apprehend our&s;elves called into this public Station of Preaching, ought clo&s;ely to wait on our Guide, to put us forth in the Work. And <HI>dear Friends,</HI> I &s;ee great Need for us to carefully mind our Openings, and go on as we are led by the Spirit; for if we over-run our Guide and Openings, we &s;hall be confu&s;ed, not knowing where, or how to conclude: But if we begin and go on with the Spirit, we &s;hall conclude &s;o, that all who are truly &s;piritual will &s;en&s;ibly feel that we are right: Thus will our Mini&s;try edify them that hear it.</P>
<P>And <HI>dear Friends,</HI> let us be &s;ingly and in Sin|cerity devoted to the Will of God, whether to preach or be &s;ilent; for if we are not &s;en&s;ible of

&s;uch a Re&s;ignation, it is doubtful, that we may &s;et our&s;elves at work, when we &s;hould be quiet, and &s;o bring an Unea&s;ine&s;s upon our Friends, and a Burthen upon our&s;elves: And this Conduct will &s;hut up Friends Hearts again&s;t our Service and Mini&s;try. And <HI>my dear Friends,</HI> every Time you appear in the Mini&s;try, when it is over, examine your&s;elves narrowly, whether you have kept in your Places, and to your Guide; and con&s;ider, whether you have not u&s;ed &s;uperfluous Words, that render the Matter di&s;agreeable, or &s;uch Tones or Ge&s;tures as mi&s;become the Work we are about, always remembring, that the <HI>true Mini&s;ters preach not</HI> them&s;elves, <HI>but Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord.</HI> Let us bear this in mind, that neither Arts, Parts, Strength of Memory, nor former Experiences will, with|out the Sanctification of the Spirit, do any Thing for us to depend upon. Let us therefore, I en|treat you, keep to the living Fountain, the Spring of eternal Life, opened by our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t in our Hearts.</P>
<P>I al&s;o de&s;ire, that you would not neglect your Day's Work, in vi&s;iting the dark Corners of the Counties about you; but be mindful of your Ser|vice therein, as the Lord &s;hall make Way for it.</P>
<P>The Things above written have been on my Mind to communicate to you, <HI>my dear Friends,</HI> with De&s;ires that the God and Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t may be with your Spirits, <HI>Amen.</HI> Hoping al&s;o, that I &s;hall not be forgotten by you, in your neare&s;t Approaches to the Throne of Grace, in your Supplications to the God of the

rail and abu&s;e the <HI>Quakers;</HI> but he, being in the Commi&s;&s;ion of the Peace, mu&s;t (as <HI>Keith</HI> was re|commended by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI>) &s;hew &s;ome Re&s;pect; withal adding, that <HI>John Faulkner</HI> &s;hould bring me to his Hou&s;e to dine the next Day: which <HI>John Faulkner</HI> would have excu&s;ed, urging, that as they had a Value for me, &s;undry Friends would be for bringing me on my Way farther; adding, we &s;hould incommode his Hou&s;e. He urged it the more, &s;aying, <HI>we &s;hould all be welcome.</HI> Accordingly &s;eve|ral went with me there, and he was very kind, giv|ing us an Account of <HI>George Keith</HI>'s railing again&s;t us the Day before, and how di&s;agreeable it was to the A&s;&s;embly. <HI>Keith</HI> left a broad Sheet printed, where|in he pretended to prove the <HI>Quakers</HI> no <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> out of their own Books; I had an An&s;wer thereto in print, which Friends were glad of, and I left with them &s;everal to &s;pread where he had left his.</P>
<P>After we had dined, we took our Leave, and a Friend, my Guide, went with me, and brought me to a People called <HI>Labadei&s;ts,</HI> where we were civilly entertained in their Way. When Supper came in, it was placed upon a long Table in a large Room, where, when all Things were ready, came in, at a Call, about twenty Men or upwards, but no Women: We all &s;at down, they placing me and my Compa|nion near the Head of the Table, and having pau&s;ed a &s;hort Space, one pulled off his Hat, but not the re&s;t till a &s;hort Space after, and then one after another they pulled all their Hats off, and in that uncovered Po&s;ture &s;at &s;ilent (uttering no Words that we could hear) near Half a Quarter of an Hour; and as they
<PB N="70" REF="008308_0077_102E87F61D9424C0">
did not uncover at once, &s;o neither did they cover them&s;elves again at once; but as they put on their Hats fell to eating, not regarding tho&s;e who were &s;till uncovered, &s;o that it might be about two Mi|nutes Time or more, between the fir&s;t and la&s;t put|ting on of their Hats. I afterwards queried with my Companion concerning <HI>the Rea&s;on of their Conduct,</HI> and he gave this for An&s;wer, That they held it un|lawful to pray till they felt &s;ome inward Motion for the &s;ame; and that &s;ecret Prayer was more accepta|ble than to utter Words; and that it was mo&s;t pro|per for every one to pray, as moved thereto by the Spirit in their own Minds.</P>
<P>I likewi&s;e queried, <HI>if they had no Women among&s;t them?</HI> He told me they had, but the Women eat by them&s;elves, and the Men by them&s;elves, having all Things in common, re&s;pecting their hou&s;hold Affairs, &s;o that none could claim any more Right than ano|ther to any Part of their Stock, whether in Trade or Ha&s;bandry; and if any had a mind to join with them, whether Rich or Poor, they mu&s;t put what they had in the common Stock, and if they after|wards had a Mind to leave the Society, they mu&s;t likewi&s;e leave what they brought, and go out empty handed.</P>
<P>They frequently expounded the Scriptures among them&s;elves, and being a very large Family, in all upwards of a Hundred Men, Women and Children, carried on &s;omething of the Manufactory of Linen, and had a very large Plantation of Corn, Tobacco, Flax, and Hemp, together with Cattle of &s;everal Kinds. [But at my la&s;t going there, the&s;e People
<PB N="71" REF="008308_0078_102E87F8D4DEC218">
were all &s;cattered and gone, and Nothing of them remaining of a religious Community in that Shape.]</P>
<P>I left this Place and travelled through the Country to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and was there &s;eized with a <HI>Fever</HI> and <HI>Ague,</HI> which held me about thirteen Weeks, and I &s;taid there till the yearly Meeting came on, which was very large, but my Di&s;order of the <HI>Ague</HI> would not admit my being at one Meeting; <HI>George Keith</HI> with his Companions came, but the Di&s;turbance they gave was a con&s;iderable Advantage to Friends, and the Meeting ended to great Satisfaction.</P>
<P>Being recovered and pretty &s;trong, I left <HI>Penn&s;yl|vania,</HI> and travelled through the <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ys</HI> Ea&s;t and We&s;t, and having given Expectation to a Friend, one <HI>James Miller</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who had a Si&s;ter mar|ried to one of the <HI>Barclay</HI>'s Family, that it I came near where the dwelt, I would vi&s;it her at his Reque&s;t. She was a very zealous hone&s;t Friend, but her Hu&s;|band joined <HI>Keith,</HI> and left Friends; and on enquir|ing about her, where &s;he dwelt? I was told, it would be very little out of my Way. Then a young Man offered to be my Guide, to pay her a Vi&s;it; and when we came to the Hou&s;e, there were &s;undry Prie&s;ts, with others, met to &s;prinkle an Infant, the &s;aid <HI>Bar|clay</HI>'s Grandchild: The Ceremony was over before we got there, we coming from <HI>Shrew&s;bury</HI> Yearly-meeting, where <HI>Keith</HI> al&s;o had been, but gave us no Di&s;turbance, nor did he come to our Meeting at all, but held a Meeting a &s;mall Di&s;tance from us for two Days, and then went off. Our Meeting held three Days, and was thought to be larger by much, in Expectation that <HI>George Keith</HI> would be there. It

ended well, and it was &s;aid, &s;ome were convinced at that Meeting</P>
<P>But to return to my Friend <HI>Barclay;</HI> &s;he was in an Apartment by her&s;elf, and gave me a &s;hort Ac|count of what they were or had been doing; &s;aying <HI>they have &s;prinkled the Bab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> my Grand-child, and the Ceremony is over, but they have not yet been to Dinner;</HI> to which &s;he added, <HI>my Hu&s;band will be earne&s;t for thy Company; if thou ha&s;t Freedom to go, I &s;hall leave thee at Liberty, but if thou refu&s;e&s;t to go, they will be ready to report, that thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> not face them;</HI> adding, <HI>I would be plea&s;ed with your Company</HI> (meaning me and my Companion) <HI>to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne with me, but it will be be&s;t, I think, for you to dine with them, and I hope,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>the Lord will give you Wi&s;dom to conduct your&s;elves, that they may have no ju&s;t Cau&s;e to reproach the Principle on your Account.</HI> She had no &s;ooner ended, than (as &s;he had &s;ugge&s;ted) her Hu&s;band came, and after &s;ome Compliments, and Enquiry about his Brother-in-law <HI>James Miller,</HI> and Relations at <HI>Ury,</HI> we were called to Dinner, and by no Means would he excu&s;e me: We went in, and the Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Fea&s;t, the Mother of the Babe then &s;prinkled, would have me &s;it at her Right-hand, and &s;et <HI>George Keith</HI> at her Left.

refu&s;ed, and put it to <HI>George Keith,</HI> but he refu&s;ed it likewi&s;e: When &s;he had done helping us and her|&s;elf, &s;he began to catechi&s;e me in the following manner.</P>
<P>After enquiring about her Relations at <HI>Ury</HI> in <HI>Scot|land,</HI> and her Uncle <HI>Miller,</HI> &s;he then de&s;ired to know my Bu&s;ine&s;s in <HI>Scotland,</HI> pretending to &s;uppo&s;e me a Merchant that dealt in Linen to &s;ell in <HI>England;</HI> but I &s;aw her De&s;ign was to lead me to &s;ome unwary An|&s;wer, for <HI>Keith</HI> and the re&s;t to find Matter of Objec|tion to. This put me upon my Guard, to make Reply cautiou&s;ly, I freely owned I had no Concern in buying or &s;elling of any &s;ort of Goods. <HI>Pray then,</HI> Sir, <HI>what was your Call there;</HI> I replied, that I thought it my place &s;ometimes to advi&s;e my Friends and o|thers, to endeavour &s;o to live, that Death, when it comes, might not be a Terror to them; and doubt not but thou wilt count this a good Work, and need|ful to be done. She readily allowed, <HI>that it was ve|ry needful,</HI> and the more &s;o, <HI>for that the Age was now very wicked.</HI> Then &s;he proceeded to query the Rea|&s;on of my coming into tho&s;e Parts, pretending to &s;uppo&s;e it was on account of Trade, as being a Su|percargoe, with &s;undry trifling and impertinent Que&s;|tions, as <HI>when I was in &s;uch and &s;uch Places?</HI> To all which I gave her An&s;wers to the &s;ame Effect as be|fore, that my de&s;igned Bu&s;ine&s;s was the &s;ame in this Country as in <HI>Scotland.</HI> Then &s;he proceeded to more trifling Que&s;tions, as <HI>when I landed? and where?</HI> and <HI>which Way I was going?</HI> All the Company at Table gave ear to our Dialogue, which appeared to me very weak in &s;uch a learned Company as they
<PB N="74" REF="008308_0081_102E87FFABABF268">
thought them&s;elves to be, and none &s;o much as put in a Word between us. Dinner being ended, I de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed, for that Time called me away, and my Friends would wait for me at the Ferry, which we had to pa&s;s that Evening. Thus <HI>Keith</HI> and I met and parted.</P>
<P>Then taking Leave, I went to &s;ee my worthy Friend in her own Aparment, with whom we had a &s;hort, but very agreeable Opportunity: We took our Leave and went to <HI>Woodbridge,</HI> where the next Day we had a Meeting, <HI>George Keith</HI> preached at <HI>Amboy</HI> the &s;ame Day, which Places are not far apart; we often interfered one with the other, but he no more gave me any Challenge to di&s;pute, but took another Method to put a Stop to my Travelling, as will appear afterwards. We came to <HI>Long-I&s;land,</HI> and a Meeting was appointed for me at a &s;mall Vil|lage called <HI>Hamp&s;tead.</HI> where <HI>George Keith</HI> al&s;o was, either by Accident or De&s;ign, and had at the &s;ame appointed to preach within our hearing, and between the two Appointments, there was a very large Ga|thering; and I being young and &s;trong, my Voice was plainly heard by the People who were with <HI>Keith,</HI> &s;o that they all left his Meeting and came to ours, (for we had Room enough for both Meetings, it be|ing a very large Barn) except he that exerci&s;ed as Clerk, and one <HI>William Bradford,</HI> who had been a <HI>Printer</HI> for Friends at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> but de&s;erting the Society, Friends took the Bu&s;ine&s;s from him. But &s;ome Time after, <HI>Keith</HI> and the &s;aid <HI>Bradford</HI> agreed, that <HI>Bradford</HI> &s;hould come and try if no Advantage might be taken at my Doctrine; accordingly he came,

<P>Thus all Things were ready to be put in Execu|tion, and &s;undry &s;ub&s;tantial People, not Friends, would have had me gone off, but that I could not do; therefore on the <HI>29th</HI> of the &s;ame Month, as I was at <HI>Flu&s;hing</HI> in <HI>Long-I&s;land,</HI> it being the Half-yearly Meeting, which was very large, <HI>Keith</HI> being expected there: When the Meeting was fully &s;et, the High-Sheriff came with a very large Company with him, who were all armed; &s;ome had Guns, others Pitchforks, others Swords, Clubs, Halberts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as if they &s;hould meet with great Oppo&s;ition in taking a poor &s;illy harmle&s;s Sheep out of the Flock.
<PB N="81" REF="008308_0088_102E8812D2EFEA68">
The Sheriff &s;tepping up into the Gallery, took me by the Hand, and told me, <HI>I was his Pri&s;oner.</HI> By what Authority? &s;aid I: He pulled out his Warrant, and &s;hew'd it me: I told him that Warrant was to take up <HI>Samuel Bowne,</HI> and my Name was not <HI>Samu|el Bowne,</HI> but that Friend's Name is &s;o; pointing at the Friend by me: We know him, &s;aid he, that's not the Man, but you are the Man: Pray then; <HI>What's your Name?</HI> That, &s;aid I, is a Que&s;tion that requires Con&s;ideration, whether proper to an&s;wer or not, for no Man is bound to an&s;wer to his own Pre|judice; the Law forces none to accu&s;e him&s;elf. Thus we <HI>pro'd</HI> and <HI>con'd</HI> a little Time; and I got up from my Seat, and <HI>John Rodman, Samuel Bowne,</HI> and &s;undry other Friends, and walked out of the Meeting, it not being proper to di&s;cour&s;e there at that Time; and they on conver&s;ing with the Sheriff, who in his Nature was a very moderate Man, hav|ing known Friends in <HI>England,</HI> ea&s;ily prevailed on him to &s;tay the Meeting, with all his Retinue; and afterwards they would con&s;ider what was be&s;t to be done. They willingly laid down their Arms on the out&s;ide of the Door, and came in, which encrea&s;ed the Throng very much: The Meeting was &s;ilent a con&s;iderable Time, and the Sheriff's Company que|ried of one another privately, &s;o as I heard it, <HI>Why I did not preach?</HI> others concluding that I &s;hould preach no more, being now a Pri&s;oner; that's e|nough to &s;ilence him, &s;aid they: But finding the Word like as a Fire, I could no longer contain, but &s;tanding up, I had a very agreeable Service, both to my&s;elf and Friends, with the re&s;t of the Company;
<PB N="82" REF="008308_0089_102E8816AFD90DD0">
the Sheriff him&s;elf, and his Company al&s;o, &s;poke well of it: It was the fir&s;t Day of the Meeting, and the &s;eventh of the Week. After Meeting was end|ed, &s;undry Friends went to <HI>Samuel Downe</HI>'s, to con|&s;ult with the Sheriff, and he being very moderate, and in a very good Humour, &s;poke very mild and courteou&s;ly, blaming <HI>Keith</HI> and <HI>Bradford,</HI> and gave Liberty that I &s;hould &s;tay with my Friends until <HI>Fifth-day</HI> following, there being two Days of the Meeting yet to come, and a Funeral of a noted Friend to be the Day after it ended: The Meeting encrea|&s;ed, and the la&s;t was both large&s;t and mo&s;t open; it was &s;uppo&s;ed there might be near 2000 People the la&s;t Day, but <HI>Keith</HI> did not come there.</P>
<P>Now the Time for my Appearance before the Ju|&s;tices being come, &s;undry, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tantial Friends went with me, and a great Crowd o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> other People came to hear; but for want of the Conveniency of a large Hall, which they might have had, but by the Cold|ne&s;s of the Sea&s;on, as was pretended the Ju&s;tices would not go there, &s;o they were deprived of the Opportunity for want of Room to hear my Exami|nation.</P>
<P>There were four Ju&s;tices, <HI>viz. Jo&s;eph Smith, Ed|ward Burrows, John Smith</HI> and <HI>Jonathan Whitehead.</HI> This la&s;t was a very moderate Man, and endeavour|ed much to have &s;et me at Liberty; but they had a Prie&s;t with them, who endeavoured to put the wor&s;t Con&s;truction on every Thing I &s;aid: Be&s;ides, they had &s;hut a Man up behind in a Clo&s;et, to take in Short-hand the Examination, that they might pe|ru&s;e the &s;ame to their own Advantage: But the Man

was &s;o very drunk, that he lo&s;t his Papers going Home, and a Friend providentially found them, to their great Di&s;appointment and Shame: Great En|quiry was made about them among the People in vain. Having done what they thought fit in exam|ining me, they turned me and my Friends out of the Room, to con&s;ult what was to be further done; and alter a little Time, we were all called in, I to receive my Doom, and my Friends to hear it; and the Clerk, as Mouth of the Court, &s;aid, <HI>The&s;e ho|nourable Ju&s;tices have agreed, that you mu&s;t enter into a Two Thou&s;and Pound Bail, Your&s;elf in &pound; 1000. and two of your Friends in &pound; 500. each, or el&s;e be committed to the common Goal.</HI> I an&s;wered, I could enter into no Bond on that Account. Here one of the Ju&s;tices queried, <HI>if the Sum was too large?</HI> I an&s;wered, that was Nothing to the Matter, if as &s;mall a Sum as <HI>Three-halfpence</HI> would do, I &s;hould not do it, it be|ing a Matter of &s;uch a Nature that I could by no Means comply with. Then the la&s;t Ju&s;tice offered to be bound for me, in what Sum they required. But not only I, but all my Friends, did oppo&s;e it with all our Might, giving them, as well as him, the Rea&s;on for it.</P>
<P>It growing late the Court broke up, and this Ju|&s;tice begged that he might have me to his Hou&s;e, and he would &s;ee me forth coming on the Morrow; which they readily granted him, and then they ad|journed till Ten o'Clock next Day, giving their Clerk Orders to provide my <HI>Mittimus</HI> by that Time.</P>

<P><HI>Clement</HI> replied, he might if he plea&s;ed, but when it was done, it &s;hould be expo&s;ed with as much Ex|pedition as the Ca&s;e would admit in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall;</HI> for, <HI>adds he,</HI> Juries, neither Grand nor Petty, are to be menaced with Threats of Stocks or Fines, but they are to Act freely, according to the be&s;t of their Judgments on the Evidence before them.</P>
<P>Now the Judge finding he had not Children to deal with, altered his Manner of Addre&s;s, and be|gan to flatter, and reque&s;ted that they would take back both Bills, and re&s;ume their Con&s;iderations upon them.

However, that Court was adjourn'd for &s;ix Weeks; and finding my&s;elf more clo&s;ely confined than be|fore, and not knowing when or how it would end, I began to be very thoughtful what Method to take, not to be chargeable to my Friends: And as I was full of Thought on my Pillow about the Matter, it came into my Mind to try if I could learn to make Shoes; and applying my&s;elf to a <HI>Scotch</HI> Churchman in the Neighbourhood, one <HI>Charles Williams,</HI> a good natured Man, I made a Propo&s;al to buy a Pair of Shoes of him, cut out for me to make up, and to give him the &s;ame Price as if made, withal de&s;iring him to let me have Materials and Tools to go on with the Work, reque&s;ting that he would be &s;o kind as to &s;hew me how to begin and proceed in it: I acquainted him with my Rea&s;on for &s;o doing. He replied, it is very hone&s;t and honourable in you: But, added he, if one of our Mini&s;ters was in the like State, they would think it too mean for them to take up &s;uch a diminutive Practice; though it were for Bread: And your Friends perhaps will not like it. However, he readily fell in with me, that if I could get my Bread with my own Hands, it was mo&s;t agreeable with <HI>Paul</HI>'s Practice; and according|ly next Morning he brought me Leather cut out, with Materials and Tools to Work with, and with his Direction I clo&s;ed one of the Upper-leathers be|fore he left me, and he put it on the La&s;t for me, and by Night I fini&s;hed that Shoe; which when he came to &s;ee, he admired it was &s;o well done, &s;hew|ing me how to mend the Faults in the next, which I fini&s;hed the next Day: He then &s;uppo&s;ed I had done

&s;omething at the Trade before, but was mi&s;taken: And when I would have paid him, he refu&s;ed it, and told me, he would not take any Money of me; &s;o I propo&s;ed, that if he would give the Leather, I would give my Work; and &s;o by Con&s;ent we gave the Shoes to a poor hone&s;t Man that did go on Er|rands for us both. I had then more Work of him, and he was &s;o plea&s;ed with it, that he would allow me half Pay for making it up, and was &s;o forward to advance my Wages in a few Weeks, that unle&s;s I would take full Pay, he chearfully told me, I mu&s;t look out for another Ma&s;ter: I as plea&s;antly replied, I did not de&s;ire to change: Well then, replied he, I &s;ell the Shoes you make, for as much as any of the like Sizes made in my Shop.</P>
<P>I made &s;uch Improvement in this Bu&s;ine&s;s that I could in a little Time earn fifteen Shillings per Week, being three Shillings their Money for making a Pair of large Man's Shoes, which was my chief Work. Now their Shilling was about Nine-pence Sterling. This new Trade was of very great Service to me, by both diverting Body and Mind; and finding I now could &s;upply my own Wants with my own Hands, it gave me great Ea&s;e indeed: But &s;ome Friends were unea&s;y that I &s;hould do it, as &s;uppo&s;ing it would be to their Di&s;honour; but others again were glad, and thought it a great Honour to the Cau&s;e of the Go&s;pel; and they rejoyced with thankful Hearts that I &s;ucceeded &s;o well.</P>
<P>Going on thus &s;ome Weeks, my kind Ma&s;ter came one Morning, and did not bring &s;o much Work as before. I a&s;ked him the Rea&s;on? adding plea&s;antly,

But I told him I had rather Work Jour|ney-work for him than do to &s;o: For I knew not how to get Leather and other Materials, and when I had it, I was a Stranger to the cutting it out.

<P>I went on thus for &s;everal Months, and he came to me every Day once or twice, and was a very chear|ful, plea&s;ant temper'd Man, but too much addicted to take delight in &s;ome of his Neighbours Company, who too often were di&s;gui&s;ed with &s;trong Liquor, and he would often &s;ay, if you were to continue here, I &s;hould overcome it, and I verily believe &s;hould be a &s;ober <HI>Quaker.</HI> I told him he mu&s;t leave the Com|pany he too much frequented; which he not Ob&s;erv|ing, I heard afterwards they proved very hurtful to him.

<P>This <HI>Indian,</HI> with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e his Attendants, came to vi&s;it me, and &s;taid &s;ome Time, enquiring, the Cau&s;e

It is beyond all Doubt or Que&s;tion with me, that God <HI>wills all Men to be &s;aved;</HI> and to com|pleat his Will, and Offers of Salvation to all, he has ordained the Means to <HI>procure</HI> the End by his own Son, who ta&s;ted Death <HI>for every Man,</HI> whereby <HI>all</HI> have it put into their Power, as free Agents, to make Choice for them&s;elves by applying to the Means ordained by God thro' his Son our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for the <HI>obtaining</HI> that which he has <HI>willed for them, viz.</HI> Salvation! Now, if this is true, as the Scriptures a&s;&s;ert, and our own Experience confims it to our|&s;elves, then it follows, that <HI>all</HI> who are diligent, through the <HI>Obedience</HI> of Faith, endeavouring to make their Calling and Election &s;ure, by apply|ing to the Means ordained of God, (<HI>viz.</HI> that Grace and Truth that is come by Je&s;us Chri&s;t) for the ob|taining that which he has <HI>willed for them,</HI> as I have &s;aid, we may &s;afely conclude <HI>all</HI> in this State, to be the Elect of God in Chri&s;t.

being filled with divine Sweetne&s;s and heavenly Joy, that I was pre&s;erved, and did not force my&s;elf to of|fer.

<P>Our next Meeting was to be in the Center of the Meetings which we had before, in a con&s;iderable large Hou&s;e, but not big enough for the Company by far, and the Country was all alarmed, &s;o that it was a very large Meeting indeed; and it being War Time with the <HI>Indians,</HI> the People brought &s;uch Weapons as they had to Meeting, &s;o that when we came to the Meeting hou&s;e, I was &s;urprized to &s;ee &s;o many Fire-Arms, and other In&s;truments of War, &s;tanding again&s;t the Meeting-hou&s;e Wall.

be thus &s;hut up, I came to this Conclu&s;ion and Re|&s;ignation, that <HI>I was but a Servant, and could of my|&s;elf do Nothing;</HI> &s;ecretly praying that the Lord would give me Patience not to be unea&s;y, if he had No|thing for me to do, and if he had, there I was rea|dy and willing to do it: And thus I &s;ettled down, diligently waiting for divine Direction. And in a little Time a Word came with Life, (and I &s;tood up with it) to the Effect following: <Q>The Lord's Time is the be&s;t Time, and let us not grow unea&s;y to wait for it; for when he opens none can &s;hut, and when he &s;huts none can open.</Q> Enlarging on this Subject a little more; and we had a very glorious Meeting, in which I was largely opened in &s;undry Branches of the Doctrine of Chri&s;t; and I had not &s;een very often greater Tenderne&s;s than was at that Time among&s;t the People; for the War with the <HI>Indians</HI> had humbled them to &s;uch a degree, that Truth had a very great Reach upon them indeed, and the Meeting ended well.</P>
<P>Immediately I found an uncommon and weighty Concern to reque&s;t the Mini&s;ters to come together which they very readily complied with, and they were an hand&s;ome Number, but not all thoroughly baptized into the Work.

<P>The Governor &s;ent for me, and we had a Time to confer about our Principles, and after a little Time he &s;eemed much plea&s;ed with what I had to &s;ay: And having fini&s;hed my Service I returned to <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> and found &s;ome were contriving to

Then the Place to hold the Meeting was got ready, being a large Place like a Barn, where the Friend and his Men built Boats for the Shipping, that being his Calling, and we &s;at down, being a few Friends, and in a little Time many People came, among&s;t whom, as it was &s;aid, came &s;ix Preachers: And in &s;ome convenient Time a young Woman &s;tood up who had a pretty Gift, but the People behaved very rudely, &s;o that it put the poor Girl out of Countenance, and &s;he &s;at down.

<HI>hear you.</HI> I replied, that as for <HI>Womens Preaching,</HI> its allowed a di&s;putable Point from <HI>Paul</HI>'s Words, yet neverthele&s;s if any of you are (after this Meet|ing is over) willing to hear what I have to &s;ay in Favour of it, I &s;hall be willing to give you the be&s;t Account I can why I think it is <HI>lawful:</HI> And if a|ny of you can &s;hew better Rea&s;ons again&s;t it, I &s;hall as willingly hear them. And as for the young Man, I grant you may, as he is a Neighbour, have had a much better Knowledge of his former Conduct in Life, than I can pretend to; but allowing that he may have, in Time pa&s;t, been loo&s;e, that argues not again&s;t giving him a Hearing: For how know you, but that as <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ul</HI> did, he might condemn his pa&s;t Life, and give you an Example, by his pre&s;ent Conduct, to <HI>reform;</HI> for which Rea&s;ons, you ought to have heard with Patience what he had to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay to you. The &s;ame Gentleman replied, <HI>I &s;aid very right, they ought to have heard him: But I pray you &s;peak what you have to &s;ay freely, and I charge all pre&s;ent to make no Di&s;turbance or Interruption, if they do, in the</HI> Queen's Name <HI>I will commit them.</HI> By which Words I found he was in the Commi&s;&s;ion of the Peace: And then I began, <Q>That Religi|on without Righteou&s;ne&s;s was u&s;ele&s;s, and could not profit tho&s;e who profe&s;t it.</Q> And going on, I came in the Cour&s;e of my Service to recite the great Improvement true Religion made on the Minds of tho&s;e who lived in it, in giving them Power over their Lu&s;ts and Pa&s;&s;ions, repeating that of <HI>James</HI> i. 26. <HI>If any Man among you &s;eem to be religious, and bridleth not his Tongue, but deceiveth his own Heart, this Man's</HI>

<HI>Religion is vain.</HI> One out of the Throng &s;aid, <HI>Sir, you impo&s;e upon us, there's no &s;uch Text.</HI> I made a full Stop, and turned to it; and there were many Bibles then appeared.

And indeed Truth was eminently preached that Day, and there was a con|&s;iderable

Tenderne&s;s among&s;t the People, and the Meeting ended well.</P>
<P>When I came out, the Gentleman came to me and I acknowledged his Kindne&s;s towards us; and it &s;uddenly came before me to Speak with a loud Voice in the Street, and to de&s;ire, that if any one was at a Lo&s;s, and did not under&s;tand any Part of what I had &s;aid, or thought I had &s;poken any Thing not agreeing to Scripture, I would then de&s;ire them to let me know it, and not mi&s;repre&s;ent any Thing I had &s;aid when I was gone, the Gentleman made An&s;wer on Behalf of the People thus; <HI>None can have any Objection, for I never heard the Word better preach|ed in my Time.</HI> And then I told them I was ready to let them know my Rea&s;ons, why I thought Wo|men, properly and duly qualified, might preach <HI>lawfully,</HI> on Condition I might have their Rea&s;ons to the contrary.

<P>Now being clear of the&s;e Parts I returned, vi&s;iting the Meetings of Friends, and &s;undry other Places, as in particular <HI>Cape-Ann,</HI> where I met with great Oppo&s;ition; the Ca&s;e was thus.</P>
<P>At <HI>Cape-Ann</HI> &s;undry Friends were de&s;irous of a Meeting, and more &s;o, becau&s;e that &s;everal young Men, who were Friends, re&s;ided there while they built a Ship. Accordingly I went, and &s;everal Friends went with me, and we got there early on a <HI>Seventh-day,</HI> and gave Notice of a Meeting, which was to good Satisfaction, and it being a new Thing, it was very large; the People de&s;ired another, which was granted: And between Meetings, &s;ome gave their Preacher Notice, who had but a &s;mall Congregation that Day, advi&s;ing him to look after his Flock, it being his Duty. Accordingly he came before the Meeting ended, with &s;everal of his Elders, and was very noi&s;y. Fir&s;t, he would prove <HI>Water Bapti&s;m,</HI> from the Text, to be an <HI>Or|dinance</HI> of Chri&s;t. I replied; what <HI>Form</HI> of Water Bapti&s;m would he prove &s;o? To which he an&s;wered eva&s;ively, not being willing to be tied to one more than another. But after &s;ome farther <HI>Pro</HI>'s and <HI>Con</HI>'s he was by his own People pre&s;t to vindicate his own Practice, which was <HI>Sprinkling.</HI> Then he &s;aid, that was plainly proved by our Saviour's Words, <HI>Suffer little Children to come unto me,</HI> &amp;c. I &s;hewed him

his mi&s;take; that without Perverting that Text, it could not be applied to <HI>&s;prinkling</HI> of Infants in any wi&s;e: But our Saviour's Words in that Place refered to the State of <HI>Innocency</HI> that &s;uch &s;hould experience, to be like little Children in their Minds, as free from all Manner of Vice and Wickedne&s;s, before they were &s;it and prepared for the Kingdom of Heaven, which <HI>&s;prinkling</HI> with <HI>elementary Water</HI> could not do for them. Opening more at large the State of the <HI>New-Birth</HI> and <HI>Regeneration;</HI> in doing which, he would often break in upon me, but his own People cried <HI>Shame,</HI> for the Interruption he gave, adding, when I had done, he &s;hould be heard. But he was &s;o much out about the Proof of <HI>&s;prinkling</HI> In|fants by our Saviour's Words, that I found he was very weary of the Di&s;pute, and willing to drop it, and would go on upon <HI>Perfection.</HI> I urged him to clear up <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> fir&s;t, as we were upon it; but he would break off from it, urging, that both he and his Peo|ple were &s;atisfied about it; I then a&s;ked him, <HI>why he did begin upon it?</HI> To &s;hew us our Errors, <HI>he replied.</HI> So finding nothing was like to come of it, but Tu|mult and Noi&s;e, we pre&s;&s;ed it no farther.

<HI>wrong,</HI> and not to heap up Charges of Errors, with|out &s;hewing of any thing of Proof that they were &s;o, which could by no means be a Way to convince and inform tho&s;e in Error. At which pertinent Rebuke he left us, &s;ome, though very few, going with him. I then de&s;ired the People to &s;it down, and be &s;till; which they readily complied with; and after a &s;hort Pau&s;e, it was with me briefly to &s;peak to each Point, explaining, as well as I could, in &s;o &s;hort a Time, the Doctrine of outward Bapti&s;m to be but a Figure of the <HI>Inward,</HI> as outward Circumci&s;ion was of the <HI>Inward,</HI> viz. <HI>of the Heart:</HI> And likewi&s;e &s;etting forth the <HI>new Birth</HI> and <HI>Regeneration</HI> in as clear a Light as Time would permit; with <HI>Perfection</HI> and <HI>Election,</HI> and <HI>Reprobation;</HI> all which, though but very briefly touched upon, took up a con&s;iderable Time, &s;o that the Night was above half &s;pent con&s;iderably.

Some few of them &s;tay'd a &s;hort Time after, de&s;iring that they might have more &s;uch Meetings, and we parted in much Love and Sweetne&s;s; in particular, that Elder who reprehended the Mini&s;ter, as he called him, &s;aid, <HI>Religion could never pro&s;per, &s;o long at it was made a Trade of to get Bread by;</HI> and he &s;eemed con|vinced, that both the Doctrine and practice of their People were <HI>incon&s;i&s;tent</HI> with primitive Religion and our Saviour's Doctrine.

<P>Having vi&s;ited the Meetings in our own County, and delivered up my Certificate, giving an Account of my Travels, at next Monthly-Meeting I acquaint|ed Friends with my intended Marriage, having a few Lines from under my intended Wife's Hand, as like|wi&s;e from her Parents, &s;hewing all their Con&s;ent.

<P>By this Time the Spring was advanced, and my Worthy Friend <HI>James Wil&s;on</HI> offered his Company to go to my Marriage; accordingly we &s;et forward, and took in our Way the Yearly-meeting at <HI>Middlewich,</HI>

which was very large, and &s;undry weighty Friends were there, I had great Sati&s;faction and Comfort in being there.

and it was a very large Meeting, &s;undry Public Friends be&s;ides <HI>Thomas Camm</HI> being there.

<P>As &s;oon as the Meeting was over, dear <HI>James</HI> and I had a heavy Parting; but as I was going to my Wife, that helped to chear my Heart a little.

And now I &s;taid with my dear Wife, and went very little abroad for more than twelve Months, having very great Comfort and Satisfaction in my married State, my Wife being a true Sympathizer with me in all the Exerci&s;es which I often was under, of one

<P>Then finding a Concern to vi&s;it <HI>Ireland,</HI> I ac|quainted her therewith, and &s;he gave me up &s;o free|ly and cheerfully, that it was a Cordial to me; &s;ay|ing, that &s;he expected I would often leave her, and that &s;he had re&s;olved in her&s;elf before Marriage, &s;he would never hinder my Mini&s;try if &s;he could po&s;&s;ibly avoid it, and &s;he hoped that the Lord would &s;trength|en her, and make that ea&s;y to her.</P>
<P>So accordingly about the <HI>Fifth-Month</HI> 1708, I ap|plied to the Monthly-meeting for a Certificate, which I had, and then took Shipping at <HI>Minehead,</HI> and landed at <HI>Cork,</HI> where I &s;taid two or three Meetings to good Satisfaction: Then I went to <HI>Charlevill</HI> and <HI>Limerick,</HI> vi&s;iting the Meetings along that Side of the Nation to <HI>Colrain,</HI> and I found very hard Work in many Places, and in &s;ome Meetings was quite &s;hut up; but I found, where the People who did not pro|fe&s;s with us came in plentifully, it was not &s;o, but there was an open Door; and that worthy Friend, and heavenly minded, meek, and divine Preacher,
<PB N="137" REF="008308_0144_102E88A946DA3620">
<HI>Gilbert Thomp&s;on,</HI> was there at the &s;ame Time; and when we conver&s;ed about it, I found he was, much as I was, &s;hut up, and found it very hard Work in &s;ome Places to get forward; and as he was in Expe|rience and Age much my Superior, I reque&s;ted what he thought might be the Rea&s;on, <HI>why it &s;eemed more dead among&s;t Friends in this Nation now, than in &s;ome other Places?</HI> He gave this as a Rea&s;on, <HI>That the Pro|fe&s;&s;ors of Truth in that Nation were very &s;trict and exact in &s;ome Things, and placed much in</HI> outward Ap|pearance, <HI>but too much neglected the</HI> Reformation <HI>and</HI> Change <HI>of the</HI> Mind, <HI>and having the</HI> In&s;ide <HI>thoroughly clean&s;ed from</HI> Pride <HI>and</HI> Iniquity; <HI>for thou knowe&s;t,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>the Leaven of the</HI> Phari&s;ees <HI>was always hurt|ful to the Life of Religion in all Shapes.</HI> Yet never|thele&s;s we found a brave living People in that Nation, and great Encouragement there was to vi&s;it fre&s;h Places.</P>
<P>I came from <HI>Colrain</HI> to <HI>Lurgan, Mount Allen,</HI> and &s;undry &s;mall Meetings thereabout, <HI>Hil&s;borough, Li&s;burn, Ruffer-I&s;land,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Drogheda,</HI> Friends having a Meeting-hou&s;e in that Town, but few came to Meeting, there being no Friends in the Town, except two Men. From thence I went for <HI>Dublin,</HI> then vi&s;ited the Meetings towards <HI>Wicklow, Water|ford</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Cork,</HI> and had a large Meeting at <HI>Kin&s;ale,</HI> it being the fir&s;t Meeting in the Meeting-hou&s;e that Friends had built there. Friends in that Kingdom are highly to be commended, in not &s;par|ing Charge for accommodating Meetings, either by building or hiring Places for that Service.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="008308_0145_102E88AAC8F92650">
By this Time the Half-yearly-meeting at <HI>Dublin</HI> came on, but Nothing very remarkable happened there. I took my Leave of Friends, and when clear I left the City, and my dear Friend <HI>Jo&s;eph Gill</HI> ac|companied me about three Weeks. He did not then appear as a Mini&s;ter in Meetings, but was un|der great Exerci&s;e, and I was &s;atisfied he was under a very con&s;iderable Influence of divine Goodne&s;s, which would be manife&s;ted by his coming forth in the Mini&s;try in due Time, which accordingly came to pa&s;s; for in a few Weeks after his Return, he appeared very acceptably in the Mini&s;try, and be|came a very &s;erviceable Man in the Work.</P>
<P>After we parted I went on for <HI>Cork,</HI> in order to take &s;hipping Home, which I did, but the Wind not favouring us for almo&s;t three Weeks, gave me &s;ome Unea&s;ine&s;s, becau&s;e I wrote to my Wife, that I intended coming &s;ooner; and I heard afterwards &s;ome of our Neighbours had reported, that I with the Ship was taken into <HI>France;</HI> but my poor Wife bore up bravely under it. When the Wind &s;prung up fair, the Ma&s;ter &s;et &s;ail, but we were ju&s;t but got clear of the River before it veered again&s;t us; &s;o the Ma&s;ter purpo&s;ed that we might fetch <HI>Waterford,</HI> and thought it would be better to do &s;o than to go back to <HI>Cork;</HI> accordingly we all agreed, and got there by the Clo&s;e of the Evening, being <HI>Seventh-day;</HI> I &s;taid the <HI>Fir&s;t-day</HI> Meeting, which was ve|ry much to Satisfaction, and I was opened in the Excellency of the Go&s;pel. On <HI>Second-day</HI> we &s;et &s;ail again, and got into <HI>Minehead</HI> in about forty eight Hours, and I po&s;ted Home by <HI>Bridgwater,</HI> and met
<PB N="139" REF="008308_0146_102E88AD7051A4E8">
with a hearty and kind Welcome from all our Fami|ly, more e&s;pecially my dear Wife, having &s;pent in <HI>Ireland</HI> &s;omewhat more than eighteen Weeks. It &s;oon got abroad that I was come Home, and many Friends from &s;everal Neighbouring Meetings came to Vi&s;it me and we had great Comfort in one another.</P>
<P>Now I had nothing to do but Vi&s;it the Meetings around me, which were pretty numerous: But one Thing came upon me pretty much, and that was, <HI>to put my&s;elf into &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s to get Bread.</HI> Some propo&s;ed one Way, &s;ome another. <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Bri|&s;tol</HI> were both propo&s;ed, but I could not &s;ee my way to either of them; and what I &s;hould do in the Coun|try, being ignorant of Farming, I &s;aw not yet. At la&s;t it was propo&s;ed that I might with a little Charge make a Conveniency to make a little Malt, in which, when an Apprentice, I had &s;ome Experience, being then u&s;ed to it. I accordingly did, but my Stock was very &s;mall, but &s;ome kind Friends lent me &s;ome Money, and I found it an&s;wer better than I expect|ed, &s;o that I was encouraged to proceed; and in a|bout three Years Time, I found it an&s;wered very well, &s;o that I went on with Plea&s;ure, and to took great Care, and was very diligent in my Bu&s;ine&s;s and in attending all Meetings that I could reach in a Morning's Ride, as I found a Concern &s;o to do; and the Comfort and Happine&s;s I enjoyed was great, for I could entertain my Friends with a Lodging, and other Nece&s;&s;aries in a plain Way, which was ve|ry agreeable to us both; and mo&s;t Friends that came, took a Bed with me one or two Nights, as be&s;t &s;uited their Conveniency in their Journey.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="008308_0147_102E88B3F52DA1D8">
But in a little Time a Storm aro&s;e: The Par&s;on of the Pari&s;h having had Nothing from our Family for thirteen Years and upwards, of his &s;mall Tithes, and other Church-dues, (as he &s;tiled them) got a Summons for me to meet him before the Ju&s;tice; but before the Time came I writ him a few Lines, to know his Demand, and he writ me a long Letter in an&s;wer thereto. And I replied to his An&s;wer. All which are hereunto annexed. The Time came, and &s;ome other Friends were convened by other Prie&s;ts from other Pari&s;hes at the &s;ame Time. When I was called, there were two Ju&s;tices, one <HI>Edward Phillips</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of <HI>Montacute,</HI> and&mdash;<HI>Harben</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of <HI>Newton: Phillips</HI> was very rough and boi&s;terous in Words, and <HI>Harben</HI> altogether as mild, u&s;ing &s;undry Arguments to per&s;wade me to pay it my&s;elf, or &s;uffer &s;ome other Per&s;on to pay it, being very earne&s;t that I &s;hould &s;uffer him to pay it for me, and he would not de&s;ire to have it altogether; &s;uppo&s;ing that I might not &s;o well &s;pare what the Par&s;on demanded at once. I told him, I was very much obliged to him for his kind Offer, believing his Intention was to &s;erve me in it, but I could by no means accept it, without Injury to my own Mind, it being a Matter that concerned my Con&s;cience, which I was de&s;irous to keep void of Offence towards God. He took me into another Room, and was very earne&s;t to have it made up; urging, <HI>that it was &s;o much in Arrears, that it was beyond their Power to end it, and it mu&s;t be put into the</HI> Exchequer, <HI>and that would be very charge|able, which,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>mu&s;t fall upon you at la&s;t.</HI> I told him, that I could do Nothing to make it up:
<PB N="141" REF="008308_0148_102E88B579347478">
And having conferred &s;ome Time, we went in a|gain, and he &s;poke to the Effect following, <HI>that he was very &s;orry he could not &s;erve us, as we were both his Neighbours and Friends</HI> (meaning the Par&s;on and me and told the Par&s;on, <HI>it would be unea&s;y to us both; and would have us end it between our&s;elves.</HI> I &s;aid, if it were a Matter of ju&s;t Debt that I was &s;atisfied was any Neighbour's Due, I &s;hould &s;oon end it with my Neighbour <HI>Ray,</HI> and be as willing to pay, as he was to receive it; but as it was not of that Nature, I could by no means do it. So I was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and in a little Time &s;erved with an <HI>Exchequer Proce&s;s,</HI> and in a few Months after, in the next Term, I was taken up in my Way for <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> where I was going about my Bu&s;ine&s;s, and put into Goal. But when the Par&s;on had got me there, he was very unea&s;y indeed, &s;o that he could not take his Re&s;t, and told his Attorney. <HI>If he lo&s;t all his Claim, he could by no means keep me there, for he had no Re&s;t or Quietne&s;s of Mind Night nor Day.</HI> So accordingly the Attorney came to the Keeper in le&s;s than ten Days Time, in the Par&s;on's Name de&s;iring him to let me go Home to look after my Bu&s;ine&s;s: Which I accordingly did, and in a few Days went my Journey to <HI>Bri&s;tol;</HI> and when I had done my Bu&s;ine&s;s there, took a little Turn into <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> and &s;pent about two Weeks in vi&s;iting &s;undry Meetings, and &s;o returned Home.</P>
<P>Then I advi&s;ed my Friends at the Meeting for Sufferings in <HI>London,</HI> how it &s;tood; who advi&s;ed me, that the Par&s;on could not proceed farther, as he had taken me up and put me into Goal: So I heard no more of it all that Winter: But in the Spring a di&s;|tant

Relation of our Family came to my Wife when I was from Home, and de&s;ired her to lend him ten Pounds, for he was going to a Fair, being a con&s;ider|able Grazier. She had no Thoughts about the Par|&s;on's Demands, that being a much bigger Sum, and he being a <HI>Di&s;&s;enter,</HI> and having done me the like Favour, &s;he lent it him, and he gave her his Note ac|cordingly. My Wife, when I came Home, told me what &s;he had done, and I &s;aid, it was very well, mi&s;|tru&s;ting Nothing of any Trick in the Matter; but as he came in my Ab&s;ence to borrow it, &s;o in like Manner he came in pretence to pay it, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to my Wife to this Effect; <HI>Dear Cou&s;in, if you can help me to that Note, I had be&s;t pay it; you know I borrowed it of you, and &s;hall pay it to you.</HI> So &s;he very inno|cently fetch'd his Note, and he tore it immediately; and putting his Hand into his Pocket, takes out and throws her down the Par&s;on's Receipt for the ten Pounds, in full of all Demands for Tithes to that Time. My poor Wife was under a very great Sur|prize, urging, <HI>it would be a very great Unea&s;ine&s;s to me.</HI> Your Hu&s;band, &s;aid he, is, we allow, a Man of Sen&s;e, but in this he is a &s;tubborn Fool; and I would have paid it out of my own Pocket rather than he &s;hould have ruined you and him&s;elf, which this <HI>Exchequer</HI> Suit would &s;oon have done if it had gone on; for his original Demand is fourteen Pounds and upwards, and he hath been at forty or fifty Shillings Charge already, and you mu&s;t have paid that and ten Times more if it had gone on, which now I have cleared for ten Pounds; I think you are exceeding well off. <HI>Ay, but,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>we look at inward Peace

more than all that, and I &s;hall be blamed for being privy to the Contrivance, and beget a Jealou&s;y in my Hu&s;band about other Affairs.</HI> Oh! my dear Cou&s;in trouble not your&s;elf about that, &s;aid he, for I can clear you, that you are as innocent of it as a new-born Babe: And I know I could not have brought it about with your Hu&s;band, for he would have &s;tarted &s;o many Que&s;tions, that I could not po&s;&s;ibly have brought it about any other Way, than by ploughing with his Heifer. When my Wife told me of it, which was not pre&s;ently, it troubled me, to have my Te&s;timony thus evaded by this undermining Trick, which was in the Man that did it, de&s;igned for our Good no doubt, and the Note that he gave for the Money being de&s;troyed, I had nothing to &s;hew under his Hand for the Money, and what to do in it I was at a lo&s;s: But I thought it be&s;t to convene the Elders, and let them know how it &s;tood, and to be advi&s;ed how I might clear my Te&s;timony, and my dear Wife and Self, from having any Hand in this de|ceitful Trick; which I accordingly did, and they were &s;atisfied we were clear of the Contrivance, but did not know what to do to &s;atisfy others about it; one Friend was for <HI>&s;uing him</HI> that had thus trick'd me for the ten Pounds: But others thought &s;uch an Act would do more Hurt than Good, and thought it by no means advi&s;eable to act any farther, than to go to my Kin&s;man and let him know, that what he had done in the Ca&s;e, tho' by him intended for a Kind|ne&s;s, yet it had the contrary Effect on our Minds, &s;o that altho' he intended to &s;erve us, it proved a Di&s;|&s;ervice, and to reque&s;t, that for the future he would

In due Time my Wife and I took an Opportunity, and di&s;cour&s;ed the Matter over with him; and he to excu&s;e it &s;aid, he little thought we would take it &s;o much ami&s;s as we had, having, as he thought, no Rea&s;on for it, and won|dered that our Friends &s;hould be &s;o &s;tubborn as to contend again&s;t Law; and he could not bear to think we &s;hould be &s;erved as Mr. <HI>Banton</HI> and Mr. <HI>Tilly</HI> were; and indeed, if it were again to do, I &s;hould do the &s;ame, <HI>&s;aid he.</HI> Robert Banton <HI>and</HI> William Tilly <HI>were two very great Sufferers by</HI> Exchequer Proce&s;s, <HI>both very hone&s;t &s;incere Friends.</HI> Thus was this Af|fair ended.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been above thirteen Years in the Pa|ri&s;h, and have not given your Family any Di|&s;turbance, though the Arrears which are due to me are con&s;iderable; &s;o that you have no Rea&s;on to complain of hard U&s;age from me, but rather to thank me for my Kindne&s;s, in bearing this Inju|&s;tice &s;o long.</P>
<P>You don't think, when you go to Law with one another, or with &s;ome of tho&s;e who differ from you, that you &s;poil their Goods, when you put them to Charges, that you may force them to do you Ju&s;tice. And why, pray you, &s;hould it be thought a Spoiling of your Goods, when we do no|thing more than you do your&s;elves, when you think you are wronged; that is, endeavour to re|cover
<PB N="146" REF="008308_0153_102E88C5858EAF08">
our own? For I demand nothing of you but what I know to be mine before I receive it.</P>
<P>You might as well make an Entry upon our <HI>Glebelands,</HI> or upon any Thing el&s;e we po&s;&s;e&s;s, as to &s;eize upon the Tithes, to which you have no more Title than to the other, unle&s;s you have bought them, as I am &s;ure you have not.</P>
<P>For every Body who under&s;tands the&s;e Things, will tell you, that when &s;uch Lands as are Tithe-free, are &s;old or lett, they are for that Rea&s;on valued at an higher Price, and the Lord or Seller makes the Tenant or Purcha&s;er pay for the Tithe, as well as for the re&s;t of the E&s;tate: And that on the other hand, there is a proportionable Abate|ment made to the Purcha&s;ers and Tenants of &s;uch Lands as are liable to the Payment of Tithes. And there is very good Rea&s;on for it, becau&s;e in that Ca&s;e, the Tithes being no Part of the Land|lord's Property, he cannot make them over to a|nother, or demand a Price for that which he has not &s;old; and tho&s;e who Rent or Purcha&s;e his E&s;tate, can claim no Title by Virtue of any Con|veyance or Grant of his, but only to what he had a Right to di&s;po&s;e of him&s;elf: So that if you will needs, in this matter pretend Con&s;cience, you ought not to occupy any Land but what is Tithe free.</P>
<P>But if you think that this would be very grie|vous and inconvenient, you ought, when you oc|cupy Tithe-land, to permit us quietly to enjoy our Tithes, which are a Part of our <HI>Free-hold,</HI> and to which we have the &s;ame Title as we have to our <HI>Glebe,</HI> wherein you claim no Propriety, as indeed
<PB N="147" REF="008308_0154_102E88C82D0E8008">
you have no manner of Title to the Tithe. If you have, be plea&s;ed to &s;hew it, and let us know from whom you had it. And if you have none, as I know you have not, don't go to pretend Con|&s;cience for invading your Neighbour's Property.</P>
<P>For my Part, I do not &s;ee any Rea&s;on, why you &s;hould not actively comply with the Law for Payment of Tithes, as well as with that for Tax|es, as your Friends have done over all the King|dom ever &s;ince the Revolution; and &s;ome of them have been Collectors, though the Title of the Act of Parliament did plainly &s;hew that the Tax was for carrying on a War again&s;t <HI>France</HI> with Vigour: And yet your Friends, even tho&s;e who have been of greate&s;t Reputation among you, and the Champions of your Cau&s;e, have de|clared as much again&s;t the Lawfulne&s;s of all War, as they have done again&s;t the Payment of Tithes; and &s;ometimes have carried the matter &s;o high, as to refu&s;e the Payment of Money demanded of them for that Purpo&s;e as <HI>Robert Barclay</HI> in his <HI>Apology</HI> tells us, <HI>they &s;uffered, becau&s;e they would not Pay for Drums and Colours, and other Military Fur|niture.</HI> And this they did in the Time of Peace, when the Militia met only to make a Raree-&s;how, and had at the Place of Rendezvous no other Enemies to &s;kirmi&s;h with but Butterflies. Ne|verthele&s;s, &s;ince the War again&s;t <HI>France</HI> began, your Friends have given the &s;ame active Obedi|ence to the Laws for Payment of Taxes, as their fellow Subjects have done; and I hope, you for the future, will do for the Payment of Tithes, which,
<PB N="148" REF="008308_0155_102E88C9EE2337E0">
according to your avowed Principles, is as law|ful as the Payment of Taxes for carrying on a War with Vigour.</P>
<P>It is a vain Thing to pretend Con&s;cience to ex|cu&s;e Oppre&s;&s;ion or Covetou&s;ne&s;s, for it mu&s;t be one or either of the&s;e, which makes any Man take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what is not his own, but his Neigh|bour's.</P>
<P>If we lived by the Alms-ba&s;ket, and could claim nothing but what we might expect from the Benevolence of tho&s;e from whom we make any Demand of this Nature, we could not blame you &s;o much: But the Ca&s;e is otherwi&s;e: for we de&s;ire none of your Benevolence, and we know the Tithe is no Part of your E&s;tate, and that you can claim no Right to it, either by Donation or Purcha&s;e. Therefore don't go to call that your own which is not; and being you di&s;claim all Violence again&s;t, or Oppre&s;&s;ion of Men upon the Account of their Con&s;cience, we may rea&s;onably expect &s;o much Tenderne&s;s from you, that you would not oppre&s;s us, becau&s;e we differ from you, and that you would not, under a Pretence of Con&s;cience, &s;eize upon our E&s;tates, and then make an Outcry again&s;t us, when we de&s;ire the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the civil Magi&s;trate, for recovering any Part of our Properties or Free|holds, as often as you unju&s;tly invade them. Sure|ly we might look for more Equity from you, be|ing we are Members of that Church which in other Re&s;pects permits you the free Exerci&s;e of your Religion, and has confirmed the &s;ame
<PB N="149" REF="008308_0156_102E88CB714AD1F8">
by the late Act of Indulgence, agreed upon by the Bi&s;hops, Lords, and Commons of our Communion.

<P>You &s;ay, <HI>You take it hard to be &s;o treated by a Man of my Preten&s;ions, and if it was from &s;ome of the &s;ame Cloth, you would think it was like them|&s;elves.</HI> But why &s;hould it be thought incon&s;i&s;t|ent with my Preten&s;ions, to demand what I know to be my own?

<P>SINCE thou ha&s;t advanced &s;ome Arguments for for thy taking Tithes, I have &s;omewhat to of|fer in An&s;wer thereunto, for my <HI>Refu&s;al.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><HI>1&s;t.</HI> Thou art plea&s;ed to write, <HI>I ought to thank thee for forbearing with this Inju&s;tice &s;o long;</HI> but I take the Refu&s;al of paying Tithes to be no In|ju&s;tice. <HI>Therefore,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2dly.</HI> Thou &s;ays, <HI>when I go to Law with another,</HI> (or &s;ome that differ from me) <HI>I do not think that Spoiling of their Goods;</HI> which I do not take to be a parallel Ca&s;e with this: For, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> if I go to Law
<PB N="151" REF="008308_0158_102E88D322066B30">
with any Man, it &s;hall be for &s;ome <HI>ju&s;t Debt</HI> ow|ing to me, for which he, whom I &s;o go to Law with, &s;hall have received &s;ome valuable Con&s;ider|ation; but from thee I have received none for the Tithe of my Increa&s;e; therefore it's not a parallel Ca&s;e.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3dly.</HI> He with whom I go to Law &s;hall have no <HI>ju&s;t Plea of Con&s;cience,</HI> becau&s;e if I can have no plain Demon&s;tration that he had of me a <HI>valuable Con&s;ideration</HI> for which I make my Demands on him, I will not go to Law at all; therefore it's not a parallel Ca&s;e.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>4thly.</HI> If on &s;uch a Foundation I go to Law, and force my adver&s;e Party to Ju&s;tice by Law, I conclude with thee, <HI>it is not &s;poiling of Goods.</HI> But to go to Law, and by it take away Peoples Goods, without &s;uch a <HI>valuable Con&s;ideration</HI> as above, is <HI>Spoiling of Goods,</HI> in my Opinion, <HI>with a Witne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Thou writes me, <HI>I may as well &s;eize of the</HI> Glebe-lands, <HI>or upon any Thing el&s;e we po&s;&s;e&s;s, as upon the</HI> Tithes. Under Favour, I am of another Mind; becau&s;e I have no Title to &s;hew for thy <HI>Glebe-lands</HI> or any Thing el&s;e thou enjoys: But for my Land, the whole I take to be mine, without any Re&s;erve or exception what&s;oever, as the Writings that give me my Title to it, do &s;ufficiently &s;et forth and declare; and I have given for it a <HI>valuable Con&s;ideration,</HI> which thou never did for the <HI>tenth Part</HI> thereof: Therefore, I am &s;ure I have more Right to it than thou can&s;t pretend to, in Ju&s;tice, Equity and Rea&s;on; becau&s;e I have bought, without Re&s;erve, the <HI>Whole,</HI> and
<PB N="152" REF="008308_0159_102E88D4A7E34DC0">
manured the &s;ame at my own Co&s;t and Charge; but thou ha&s;t bought no Part thereof, nor been at any Charge about improving it, that I know of.</P>
<P>Thou further writes, <HI>that every Body that under|&s;tands the&s;e Things, will tell me, when &s;uch Lands as are Tithe-free are &s;old, for that Rea&s;on they are valued higher.</HI> What Argument is that for the <HI>Lawfulne&s;s</HI> of Tithes according to the Go&s;pel? I conceive none at all.</P>
<P>The next is, that <HI>if I occupy Tithe-lands, I ought quietly to permit you to enjoy the Tithes:</HI> That's the Matter in Di&s;pute, which &s;hall in it's Place be &s;poken to.</P>
<P>Now I am come to thy Argument about <HI>Taxes,</HI> wherein thou endeavours to make us incon&s;i&s;tent with our&s;elves, in <HI>actively</HI> complying with the Law <HI>for Taxes,</HI> but refu&s;ing <HI>a Compliance</HI> with the Law <HI>for Tithes</HI> endeavouring thereby to lay Tithes and Taxes upon <HI>one Foundation:</HI> In this al&s;o I dif|fer from thee; for I under&s;tand Taxes to be paid as a <HI>civil Debt, Tribute</HI> or <HI>Cu&s;tom</HI> to <HI>Cae&s;ar:</HI> But Tithes are paid as a religious Act to God, and holy Church, as in its Place &s;hall be farther &s;hewn.</P>
<P>Indeed our Saviour &s;aid, <HI>Render unto</HI> Cae&s;ar <HI>the Things that are</HI> Cae&s;ars; <HI>and unto God, the Things that are God's</HI> Mark xii. 17. Now if we mu&s;t render to <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> the Things that are <HI>Cae&s;ars,</HI> and unto God the Things that are God's, then it re|mains to be proved, that <HI>Tithes</HI> are <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s Due, before they be demanded as <HI>his Right.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="008308_0160_102E88D629F97008">
But here's the grand Objection of <HI>Incon&s;i&s;tency;</HI> that becau&s;e we have &s;uffered for refu&s;ing to pay towards the Militia for <HI>Drums, Colours,</HI> &amp;c. and yet <HI>actively</HI> comply with the Law of Taxes, which is to carry on a War with Vigour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in|&s;i&s;ting on <HI>R. Barclay</HI>'s Words to &s;trengthen the Objection; we are &s;till of the &s;ame Mind with <HI>R. Barclay</HI> that <HI>Wars and Fighting are incon&s;i&s;tent with the Go&s;pel Principles; and when it's brought &s;o near to us, that by Law we are obliged to act both in Per&s;on and E&s;tate, we in this Ca&s;e abu&s;e rather</HI> pa&s;&s;ively <HI>to &s;uffer, than</HI> actively <HI>to comply, for</HI> Con|&s;cience-&s;ake. And this is &s;till our Ca&s;e, and a Suffering we lie under (with re&s;pect to the Mili|tia) in many Places, being careful to walk by the Rule of Chri&s;t's Doctrine; and yet do not hereby think our&s;elves incon&s;i&s;tent in actively complying with the Law of Taxes, in rendering to <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> the Things that are <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s, and he may do therewith what plea&s;eth him, we may not direct him; therefore, to u&s;e thy own familiar Simile, I take this Argument of Taxes to have no more Weight in it, in relation to Tithes, it being no parallel Ca&s;e, than the <HI>Enemies that the Militia met with in their Rendezvous, at their Raree-&s;how.</HI></P>
<P>Thou write&s;t, that <HI>it's a vain Thing to pretend Con&s;cience to excu&s;e Oppre&s;&s;ion or Covetou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> I am entirely of thy Mind; &s;o that where any Man pretends to refu&s;e the Payment of Tithes out of <HI>Covetou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> believing at the &s;ame Time in his Con&s;cience they are <HI>ju&s;tly due;</HI> tis pity, I &s;ay, if that be his only Excu&s;e, but that he &s;hould

<P>Thy next Paragraph is already an&s;wered.</P>
<P>I acknowledge thee a Member of that Church, or Society, who have granted us the <HI>Indulgence</HI> we now enjoy in the exerci&s;e of our Religion; for which I with the re&s;t of my Brethren, ought to be truly thankful to God and the Government. But I mu&s;t tell thee, &s;ome of thy Brethren, not of the meane&s;t rank in your Church, have, like battering Rams, endeavoured to break that

<P>Thou &s;eems angry, and to re&s;ent it, that I &s;hould take it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll or hard, to be <HI>&s;o treated by a Man of thy Preten&s;ions;</HI> but the Rea&s;on why I &s;o writ, is this, becau&s;e I have more than once heard, that my Neighbour <HI>Ray</HI> has &s;aid in our Hou&s;e, that <HI>it was a Matter of</HI> Con&s;cience <HI>to him, to</HI> force <HI>a Maintenance from &s;uch as for the Sake of</HI> Con&s;cience <HI>could not pay him</HI> u&s;ing that Text, <HI>Who&s;e Ox have I taken, or whom have I defrauded?</HI> Which I have &s;ometimes &s;poke of to others, and it gained great Credit and good Thoughts con|cerning my Neighbour <HI>Ray;</HI> and for that Rea&s;on, and no other, I took &s;uch Treatment hard.

<P>Now I &s;hall give thee my Rea&s;ons, why I can't <HI>actively</HI> comply with the Law for <HI>paying Tithes</HI> and an&s;wer thy la&s;t Paragraph in the Conclu&s;ion of this.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>1&s;t.</HI> I was in my Youth very thoughtful touch|ing the Nature and De&s;ign of <HI>Religion,</HI> and con|&s;cious to my&s;elf, that an <HI>implicit Faith,</HI> with a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Obedience,</HI> might not be &s;ufficient to bring me to the End intended by it. <HI>2dly,</HI> Ob&s;erving many under great Sufferings for refu&s;ing to pay Tithes, and their Plea for it was <HI>Con&s;cience;</HI> but

many more I found did pay, and thought they did right, at lea&s;t made no &s;cruple of Con&s;cience in doing it; this Contradiction in Practice made me willing to look into it my&s;elf; that <HI>3dly,</HI> what I did herein might not be for <HI>Imitation</HI>'s Sake on either Side, but that I might act on a Principle of <HI>Faith,</HI> as knowing, <HI>what is not of Faith is Sin.</HI> And <HI>4thly</HI> and la&s;tly, the&s;e Rea&s;ons put me on examining and trying for my&s;elf.</P>
<P>This premi&s;ed, I now a&s;&s;ure thee, that it is not out of <HI>Stubborne&s;s, Ill-humour</HI> or <HI>Covetou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> but purely on a Principle of <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> for the&s;e Rea|&s;ons following, that I can neither <HI>pay</HI> or <HI>receive Tithes.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><HI>1&s;t.</HI> The Dedication of them is gro&s;ly <HI>&s;uper&s;ti|tious</HI> (and I think prote&s;ted again&s;t by mo&s;t, unle&s;s &s;uch as love to &s;uck the &s;weet of other Mens Labour) being dedicated and given by King <HI>Ethel-wolf</HI> (about 855) to <HI>God and St.</HI> Mary <HI>for the Re|demption of his own Soul, with the Souls of his An|ce&s;tors;</HI> in the Con&s;ideration whereof, the Cler|gy were to &s;ing &s;uch Number of Ma&s;&s;es for the King and his Nobles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P N="3"><HI>3dly,</HI> And again, Tithes are required to be paid as a <HI>religious Act,</HI> viz. <HI>to God and holy Church;</HI> and as above, I am per&s;waded, that God requires no &s;uch Thing, therefore I can't pay them with a &s;afe Con&s;cience, being a <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> again&s;t that which I call <HI>Popery,</HI> not in Word and Tongue only, but in Deed and Truth al&s;o.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> Tithes are not required by the Go&s;pel, that I can under&s;tand; if thou can&s;t make it out, plea&s;e to do it, for 'tis clear to me, that Chri&s;t came to fini&s;h and put an End to that Law which re|quired Tithes, as well as to the Prie&s;thood &s;up|ported by them; therefore to continue in the Practice of Tithing, is in effect, <HI>denying that Chri&s;t is come in the Fle&s;h to put an End to them,</HI> accord|ing

<HEAD><HI>An</HI> ACCOUNT <HI>of my vi&s;iting</HI> Devon&s;hire <HI>and</HI> Corn|wall.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 21&s;t of the <HI>Eighth-Month</HI> 1715, I &s;et out from Home, and vi&s;ited <HI>Taunton, Welling|ton, Milverton, Spiceland, Cullumpton,</HI> and <HI>Top&s;ham,</HI> where the Quarterly Meeting for <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> was held at that Time: I was at three Meetings there to good Satisfaction. From thence to <HI>Sticklepath,</HI> and <HI>Launce&s;ton,</HI> where I had a very large and good Meeting. From thence to <HI>Port-I&s;aac</HI> and <HI>Fal|mouth,</HI> vi&s;iting Friends to <HI>Penrin:</HI> The Quarterly-meeting was held at <HI>Falmouth,</HI> and I had very a|greeable Service. From thence to <HI>Penrin, Mar|ket-Jew</HI> and <HI>Penzance,</HI> &s;o back to <HI>Falmouth.</HI> From thence to <HI>Au&s;tel, Tregony, Love</HI> and <HI>Li&s;kard, Ger|mans, Plymouth, King&s;bridge</HI> and <HI>To<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne&s;s;</HI> had Meet|ings at all the&s;e Places, &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me of which were very large and well; and at <HI>Exeter</HI> likewi&s;e: From that to <HI>Chard,</HI> and &s;o Home. In this &s;mall Journey I had about thirty-eight Meetings, and travell'd about three Hundred and fifty Miles.</P>
<P>In about a Year or two after this, my Wife was taken with a lingering Di&s;order, for the recovering her out of which, I applied my&s;elf to &s;everal Doc|tors, but all in vain, for &s;he continued wa&s;ting more than two Years and eight Months, growing weaker apace a few Weeks before &s;he died, which was in the <HI>Eighth-Month</HI> 1719. She died in a &s;weet Frame, often &s;aying, that <HI>Nothing troubled her, but that &s;he was &s;o ea&s;ily deceived about the Par&s;on's Tithe, which</HI>
<PB N="161" REF="008308_0168_102E88EC22CEDF98">
<HI>being done in Ignorance, not de&s;ignedly, &s;he was the more ea&s;y about it.</HI></P>
<P>After which, I was at a &s;trait what Cour&s;e to take for &s;ome Time, being in Con&s;iderable Bu&s;ine&s;s, which I kept on that Winter, and in the Spring put it off to my Servant, and left what little E&s;tate I had to him, putting off all Bu&s;ine&s;s, and went the next Summer into my own Country, the North, to vi&s;it my Friends. I went to the Yearly Meetings at <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> and <HI>London,</HI> in cour&s;e as they came, and tra|velled from <HI>London</HI> through <HI>Hert&s;on &s;hire Leice&s;ter|&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Nottingham&s;hire</HI> to <HI>Leeds,</HI> vi&s;iting the Meet|ings of Friends as I pa&s;&s;ed along: I was at &s;undry very large open Meetings in my Way to the Yearly-meeting at <HI>York,</HI> which was very large, and a great Number of Mini&s;ters of both Sexes. I had no Time till the la&s;t Meeting, and the Time of that was far &s;pent before I began, but then I took my Time pret|ty thoroughly, being opened very largely in the di|&s;tingui&s;hing between <HI>true</HI> and <HI>fal&s;e Religion,</HI> &s;etting them as it were Side by Side, that they might judge for them&s;elves of both the Wor&s;hip and the Mini&s;try, with their different Effects upon the Minds of Men and Women in regulating our Pa&s;&s;ions, and reform|ing our Minds; and opened pretty fully the Danger that Mini&s;ters were in, to preach from the <HI>Letter</HI> in|&s;tead of the <HI>Spirit;</HI> and that our former Openings and Experiences alone were not to be depended up|on, but our &s;afe&s;t and be&s;t Support in that Work, was the immediate Ability of the Spirit, opening our Under&s;tandings in Matter &s;uitable to every State, that our Words might be &s;itly &s;poken, then they would

carry their own Evidence, and be &s;erviceable to the Hearers: I was very large and particular on the&s;e Heads; and there being &s;undry Clergymen, and Teachers of other Societies, I did not hear of any Objection made to the Doctrine they heard: But &s;ome of our Friends thought, what I had to &s;ay about the Mini&s;try would have been better deliver'd in the Meeting of Mini&s;ters; but that could not have an|&s;wered to well, as to the Teachers of other Societies, who might want In&s;truction in the&s;e Things, per|haps more than our own People did. This was a ve|ry high Day, and I found in my&s;elf afterwards great Satisfaction and Peace.</P>
<P>I now vi&s;ited Friends towards <HI>Kendal,</HI> and through Part of <HI>Cumberland</HI> and <HI>Northumberland,</HI> into <HI>Scot|land,</HI> having for my Companion a young Man from <HI>Sedburg,</HI> his Name was <HI>John Blamore.</HI> I found Friends in that Nation very much decrea&s;ed in Number, above one Half, and &s;undry Meetings quite dropt, unle&s;s when a Friend came to vi&s;it them.</P>
<P>I &s;pent about &s;ix Weeks in that Nation, but No|thing extraordinary happened: I returned into <HI>Cum|berland,</HI> vi&s;iting mo&s;t of the Meetings in that Coun|ty. Our Friends had at <HI>Cockermouth</HI> appointed a Meeting to be the Day after the Fair, at the Time call'd <HI>Michaelmas,</HI> and it being in the mo&s;t hot Time of the Oppo&s;ition the <HI>Pear&s;ons</HI> gave to Friends; <HI>Job</HI> and his Brother being at that Fair on their Bu|&s;ine&s;s, they gave out, that they would be at the Meeting the next Day, which gave an Alarm to both Town and Country People, &s;o that it was a

<P>From <HI>Cockermouth</HI> I vi&s;ited the re&s;t of the Meet|ings in that Part of the County, and &s;o into <HI>We&s;tmor|land</HI> again, vi&s;iting all the Meetings in that Coun|ty, and through the Dales to <HI>Richmond,</HI> and <HI>York</HI> Quarterly-meeting the Winter Quarter, which was very large, con&s;idering the Sea&s;on of the Year. I had &s;undry &s;atisfactory Times among&s;t Friends, both in Meetings of Bu&s;ine&s;s and among&s;t the Mini&s;ters, in very freely opening, and &s;hewing my dear Bre|thren and Si&s;ters, in the Openings of divine Life, the Experience and Knowledge that I had attained to in the Work of the Go&s;pel, finding my Spirit much enlarged in the &s;etting forth thereof. But the la&s;t Meeting I was at in <HI>York,</HI> was on the fir&s;t

day in the Evening by Candle light, and the Crowd in the Hou&s;e was &s;o very great, that the Candles would hardly burn, &s;ome died quite out with the Breath of the People; the exce&s;&s;ive Croud made it very trouble&s;ome for want of Room, and not to edifying as if the Company had been le&s;s.</P>
<P>From thence I went to <HI>Bridlington Gu&s;twick, North<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">,</HI> vi&s;iting Meetings till I came to <HI>Brad|ford</HI> and <HI>Leeds:</HI> I had &s;ome very large open Meet|ings in that Part, as at <HI>Brighou&s;e, Highflats Shef|field,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<P>I now made a kind of a &s;hort Vi&s;it in my Way to <HI>London,</HI> which I vi&s;ited the thoroughly, &s;taid in the City four Weeks, and had very good Satisfaction: Returning through Part of <HI>Berk&s;hire,</HI> I had at <HI>Read|ing</HI> two very large Meetings, and &s;o into <HI>Dor&s;et|&s;hire,</HI> having no Meetings after <HI>Reading,</HI> till I came there, and &s;o to the Quarterly-meeting in <HI>Somer&s;et|&s;hire,</HI> which being the Spring Quarter, was held at <HI>Gla&s;tonbury,</HI> very large it was indeed. Then back to <HI>Somerton</HI> Monthly-meeting, vi&s;iting Meetings to and fro, being at &s;undry Funerals, both before and after the Yearly-meeting at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> which was this Year very large. From that Meeting I went to|wards <HI>London,</HI> vi&s;iting Meetings in my Way thither, and after Yearly-meeting was over I returned by

After which I came to <HI>Brid|port,</HI> quartering at <HI>Caleb Hills,</HI> who married my Niece; and this Summer, before the Yearly-meet|ing at <HI>London,</HI> I had made my Addre&s;&s;es to the Wi|dow <HI>Nichols,</HI> leaving the Matter to her Con&s;iderati|on, and now I renewed the Suit.

<P>I returned home in the Spring, and then pro|ceed in my Addre&s;&s;es to the Widow, and we were married in the <HI>Second-Month,</HI> 1722, and we went to <HI>London</HI> Yearly-meeting together, which was to very great Comfort.</P>
<P>I returned directly Home with my Wife, and being in a Coach, had no Opportunity of vi&s;iting Meeting either going or coming. Being got &s;afe Home, I applied my&s;elf to a&s;&s;i&s;t my Wife in her Bu|&s;ine&s;s as well as I could, attending General, Monthly and other Meetings on publick Occa&s;ions for three Years: Then I had a Concern to vi&s;it <HI>America</HI> once more, which my poor Wife could not at fir&s;t with Ea&s;e con&s;ent to, although I had laid it before her when I fir&s;t made my Addre&s;&s;es to her, yet when it came to be put in Practice was not ea&s;ily got over. But afterwards &s;he gave me freely up to go with my

However, that it might not look like &s;tealing away, I wrote to &s;ome of my cho&s;en Friends at <HI>London,</HI> in the North, <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and el&s;ewhere throughout this Nation, and to &s;ome few in <HI>Ireland,</HI> being willing to advi&s;e them where to meet me with Letters in that Country.

<P>I Left my own Home the 22d Day of the <HI>Tenth-Month</HI> 1726, being accompanied by my dear Wife, a Kin&s;man, and a Son-in-Law, to <HI>Pool,</HI> be|ing to take Shipping there with my Son-in-Law <HI>Jo&s;iah Nickle&s;on,</HI> but the Ship was not quite ready; and when it was ready, the Wind being again&s;t us, were obliged to &s;tay there about five Weeks, &s;o I had &s;undry &s;atisfactory Opportunities both a|mong&s;t Friends and others.</P>

with a fair Wind and plea&s;ant Weather, which car|ried us a con&s;iderable Di&s;tance off the Land; but it held but three Days, and then we had very con|trary hard Winds after that, which made me ve|ry &s;ick, and other ways out of Order, &s;o that I al|mo&s;t de&s;paired of my Life for a few Days, but had great Comfort and Peace of Mind, being &s;atisfied I was in my Place, and in the Way of my Duty. I recovered as the Weather grew better, and the Sea quieter, but we had a very long and tedious Pa&s;|&s;age, being eleven Weeks and two Days upon the Sea, from Land to Land; and on the 14th of the <HI>Second-Month</HI> 1727, we landed at <HI>Hampton</HI> other|wi&s;e <HI>Kickatan</HI> in <HI>Virginia,</HI> and that Evening I got a Pa&s;&s;age in a <HI>Pool</HI> Ship up to <HI>Sleepy-bole,</HI> and that Night about the 11th Hour I got to <HI>Robert Jordan</HI>'s, being very glad, tho' very weary, that I was got to &s;o good a Place, where I had &s;o hearty a Welcome, and had &s;o great an Income of Peace and Comfort. This being on the Seventh-day of the Week, the next Morning I went to a Funeral about twenty Miles, which was a long Journey on my fir&s;t Arri|val, and con&s;idering the Inhabitants are but thin, there was a great Concour&s;e of People on the Occa|&s;ion, and I had a pretty open Time, con&s;idering I had not quite recovered my Weakne&s;s; be&s;ides, the Motion of the Sea was very much in my Head, &s;o that I had a great Dizzine&s;s and Swimming, that made me to reel like a Drunkard, as is common in the like Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>That Night I went with my Friend <HI>Robert Jordan</HI> to an Inn, near to the Place where his Son <HI>Robert</HI>

was a Pri&s;oner, who was a pretty Youth, and had a very &s;erviceable Mini&s;try. The Father and I &s;taid with the Pri&s;oner all the next Day, and in the Even|ing went to lodge at the Pri&s;oner's Hou&s;e, his poor Wife being alone; and although her Hu&s;band was confined, &s;he was chearful. We had a Meeting in the Pri&s;on to good Satisfaction, many People came to it, and were very orderly.</P>
<P>I then had a Meeting at the We&s;tern Branch of <HI>Nan&s;emund</HI> River, and was at a Funeral of a young Man who was very much lamented.</P>
<P>I went that Night towards <HI>Chuckatuc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> where I had a fine comfortable Opportunity, and on the Road, I had &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e with an antient Friend, concerning the Health of the Country, we &s;uppo&s;ing People did not live &s;o long in <HI>Virginia</HI> as in <HI>Europe.</HI> This Friend told me, the fir&s;t Man-child that was born in the Province of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Parents lived eighty Years, and that many &s;ince had lived con&s;iderably longer; &s;o that it's not the Climate, but the Intem|perance of the People, that &s;hortens their Days, for Experience made it appear, that temperate People lived much the &s;ame Time as they do in <HI>Europe.</HI> But this Fir&s;t-born of the Province was very remark|able, for it was &s;aid that he was di&s;affected to the then government, and had uttered &s;ome trea&s;onable Expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t it, and for that Cau&s;e was tried, and &s;ound guilty, being condemned to die for that Crime: But when it was made appear, that he was the fir&s;t Male-child born in the Province of the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Nation, it was re&s;olved, that he &s;hould be par|doned.

End, to run out Nature's Race, which was eighty Years.</P>
<P>I went after this Meeting to vi&s;it the Pri&s;oner, and next day was at a Funeral, the People being very humble, by rea&s;on of a great mortality, &s;o that preaching the Go&s;pel had a very great Reach upon them, and &s;everal were convinced: Next Day I went to <HI>Levy-neck,</HI> had a Meeting, and went next Day to <HI>Surrey</HI> Meeting-hou&s;e to a Funeral, having been at four in about two Weeks. After this I took a Turn round again to <HI>Levy-neck,</HI> otherwi&s;e <HI>Pagan Creek,</HI> and had a Meeting. Thence to <HI>Ra&s;kers-neck,</HI> had a Meeting, and &s;o round till the Quarterly-meeting was at hand; and then came on to the Pri&s;oner's Hou&s;e, <HI>viz. Robert Jordan's,</HI> to lodge. Next Day at the Meeting I met a Friend of <HI>London,</HI> his Name was <HI>Jo&s;hua Fielding,</HI> who had vi&s;ited the I&s;land, and <HI>South-Carolina,</HI> and had travell'd by Land to <HI>North-Carolina,</HI> about five Hundred Miles, in about three Weeks, mo&s;tly alone, which was a difficult and hazardous Attempt: Some thought it too great an Undertaking, and &s;eemed to blame him for it, but he got &s;afe through, tho' he had no Provi&s;ion but what he carried with him, and met with but a|bout four or five Hou&s;es or Plantations in all that five Hundred Miles Travel, which obliged him to lodge in the Woods frequently; but having a &s;mall Pocket Compa&s;s, that was his Guide, when the Sun and Stars were hid from him. But I have &s;ince heard, that &s;ome others have travelled over this &s;ame Ground, (Plantations and Settlements being now placed at proper Di&s;tances) with le&s;s Hard&s;hip, <HI>viz.</HI>

they having a Road mark'd out by the Government, and now they may accompli&s;h this Journey without &s;o frequently lying in the Woods, as when this Friend came from thence. I was at the Quarterly-meeting which held the <HI>Seventh</HI> and <HI>Fir&s;t-day,</HI> and it being very hot Weather, made it a little tedious to bear, there being a great Croud of People, but the Meetings ended well, and were of good Service.</P>
<P>Thence I went to <HI>Levy-neck,</HI> and vi&s;ited all the Meetings up to <HI>Curl</HI>'s on the Bank of <HI>James</HI>'s <HI>River,</HI> had an open good Meeting there, though &s;mall. Thence to <HI>Gerrard Elli&s;on</HI>'s and had a large and o|pen Meeting. Thence to <HI>Rappahannock</HI> Ferry, tra|velling &s;ixty Miles that Day: I lodged at a poor Widow's Hou&s;e, no Friend by Profe&s;&s;ion, but &s;he was exceeding kind. I had &s;omething to &s;ay in Pray|er before Meat, with which &s;he was greatly affected, and broken into Tears very much, with &s;ome others of the Family. When we left her in the Morn|ing, &s;he would not be prevailed upon to take any Thing for our Quarters, but de&s;ired that &s;he might be favoured with &s;uch Gue&s;ts often. I gave her Children &s;omething, and we left her in much Love and Tenderne&s;s. Thence I travelled towards <HI>Ma|ryland,</HI> about &s;eventy Miles, and had but one Meet|ing in the Way, where lived one <HI>William Duff,</HI> who was at that Time a very tender and &s;erviceable Man. The Yearly-meeting in <HI>Maryland</HI> came now on, which held four Days, <HI>viz.</HI> Three for Wor&s;hip, and one for Bu&s;ine&s;s. Many People re&s;ort to it, and tran&s;act a deal of Trade one with another, &s;o that it is a kind of Market or Change, where the Cap|tains

of Ships and the Planters meet and &s;ettle their Affairs; and this draws abundance of People of the be&s;t Rank to it. It being in that called the <HI>Whit&s;un|week.</HI></P>
<P>After this Meeting I vi&s;ited the Province on that Side of the Bay, fully from <HI>Potuxant,</HI> and &s;ome Places where Meetings had not been, mi&s;&s;ing no Place till I came up to the Head of the Bay; but Nothing uncommon happened at tho&s;e Meetings, which were about eight in all. Then I ferried over the great River <HI>Su&s;quehannah</HI> to <HI>Nottingham,</HI> in <HI>Penn&s;yl|vania:</HI> Some Friends came from thence into <HI>Mary|land</HI> to meet me, and conduct me over that large Ferry, which was attended with pretty much Dan|ger, it being a wide and very rough Sea, and I &s;eem|ed in more Danger than I was upon the Ocean in the greate&s;t Storm we met with, but through Mer|cy we all got &s;afe over, altho' with hard Labour and great Care and Difficulty; and the fir&s;t Meeting that I had in that Province was in <HI>Nottingham,</HI> and I had two in that Town&s;hip. Then I vi&s;ited the Meetings as they came in cour&s;e, as <HI>New-garden, London-grave, Kinnet, Concord, Che&s;ter, Spring-field,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Philadelphia.</HI> A great Number of Friends came out of <HI>Philadelphia</HI> to meet me, which gave me great Unea&s;ine&s;s, fearing I &s;hould never be en|abled to an&s;wer the high Expectations that were rai&s;ed by &s;uch a Conduct; and it were better to for|bear &s;uch Doings, for it is rather a Hurt than a Help. Now I &s;hall give my Opinion of tho&s;e Meet|ings which were &s;o very large, &s;everal of them a|mounting to fifteen Hundred, and &s;ome more, and
<PB N="172" REF="008308_0179_102E8909F4F20808">
mo&s;tly another Generation; but very few of the El|ders, that twenty Years before were &s;erviceable, zealous Men, were now living; and many of the ri&s;ing Youth did come up in the Form more than in the Power and Life, that their Predece&s;&s;ors were in; neverthele&s;s, there was a fine living People among&s;t them, and they were in a thriving good Way, &s;un|dry young Mini&s;ters being very hopeful, both Men and Women.</P>
<P>I was at three Meetings in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> exceed|ing large, more like Yearly-meetings than common <HI>Fir&s;t-day's</HI> Meetings; after which I &s;taid but two Nights, being in ha&s;te to reach a Yearly or Quarter|ly-meeting, near 300 Miles further North, at <HI>New-port</HI> on <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> &s;o I travelled from thence to <HI>Burlington, Cro&s;&s;wicks, Stony-brook,</HI> and <HI>Woodbridge,</HI> and had Meetings at all the&s;e Places. Then to <HI>Long-I&s;land.</HI> I was at a Yearly-meeting, as they call'd it, at <HI>New-town</HI> on the fir&s;t Day of the Week; it was very large of both Friends and other People. There I found &s;undry of my former Friends, as <HI>John Rodman, Hugh Copperthwaite, Samuel Bowne,</HI> and &s;undry others, that had been of great Comfort and Support to me in my Impri&s;onment on that I&s;land, and we were truly glad to &s;ee and enjoy each other in the Truth of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Thence I took my Journey through <HI>Connecticut,</HI> near two Hundred Miles, to <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> and I went round from <HI>Newport,</HI> vi&s;iting the Meetings, as at <HI>Seconnet, Cock&s;et, Dartmouth,</HI> and back to the I&s;land, and &s;o to the Quarterly-meeting at <HI>Newport,</HI> which was very large and continued three Days.
<PB N="173" REF="008308_0180_102E890B9D6FE768">
I was largely drawn forth to the Elders and Mini&s;ters, there being pretty many of them, and had very good Satisfaction in all their Meetings. Thence back to a Monthly-meeting at <HI>Dartmouth,</HI> which was very large; but a Narrowne&s;s of Spirit did &s;ome Hurt among&s;t them, and produced &s;ome Unea&s;ine&s;s, which I endeavoured to remove, which was chiefly occa&s;i|oned by a young Man's being, as &s;ome thought, too much in the Fa&s;hion, although plain, compared with &s;ome others; yet &s;ome thought this Rea&s;on &s;ufficient to refu&s;e his Propo&s;al of Marriage among them, although well recommended from the Month|ly-meeting where he was a Member; upon which I &s;hewed them, that as he was &s;o well recommended by Certificate, they could not reject his Propo&s;al ac|cording to our Di&s;cipline. The Meeting, after we had &s;ome farther Conference about it, let the young People proceed, and Matters grew ea&s;y, and that Cloud of Difference di&s;per&s;ed and vani&s;hed, which was like to hurt both Monthly-meetings.</P>
<P>From thence I went about five Miles to one <HI>Jo|&s;eph Ru&s;&s;ell</HI>'s, in order to take &s;hipping for the I&s;land of <HI>Nantucket.</HI> We met with &s;ome Difficulty in the Pa&s;&s;age, and were obliged to put into the I&s;land cal|led <HI>Martha</HI>'s <HI>Vineyard,</HI> but had no Meeting in it. After landing on <HI>Nantucket</HI> on the &s;ixth Day of the Week, Notice being given, the next Day we had a very large Meeting in the Forenoon, and on <HI>Fir&s;t-day</HI> it was much greater, e&s;pecially in the After|noon, the Inhabitants generally inclining to Friends, there was great Love and Unity among&s;t them. I de&s;ired a &s;elect Meeting of the Elders, to whom I

had &s;omething in particular relating to <HI>Di&s;cipline</HI> and the <HI>Mini&s;try,</HI> which was of good Service, and well accepted. I &s;taid two Meetings more, and vi&s;ited &s;undry Families on the I&s;land, and then took &s;hip|ping back again, was two Nights on board, and be|ing in an open Boat, and the Weather very hot, it was tedious; &s;everal of the I&s;land came with us, and we landed at <HI>John R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ll</HI>'s; and from thence (having <HI>Nathaniel Starbu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k</HI> with me) to a &s;mall Meeting called <HI>Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Suckena&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t.</HI> Here a Man gave &s;ome Unea&s;ine&s;s, by rai&s;ing Objections about the <HI>Light,</HI> as not being <HI>univer&s;al,</HI> rendering the Doctrine, as he would expound it, again&s;t <HI>Rea|&s;on,</HI> urging, that the natural Con&s;equence mu&s;t hold forth <HI>as many Chri&s;ts as People,</HI> that were enlighten|ed by him. To which I an&s;wered, by alluding to the natural Sun, which enlightens the Earth, and every Dwelling, &s;o that we frequently &s;ay, when the Rays of Light from the Sun come into the Room, <HI>the Sun &s;hines into is;</HI> but the Sun is not therefore divided, but 'tis the &s;ame Sun that enlightens the Hou&s;e here, that does the &s;ame to another el&s;ewhere: <HI>Even &s;o is the Light of Chri&s;t:</HI> He is the true Light that enlighten's <HI>every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> coming into the World.

Place meant, and how it ought to be under&s;tood, plainly &s;hewing, that by the <HI>Kingdom of Heaven</HI> was meant the <HI>divine Seed</HI> in the Heart, otherwi&s;e called the <HI>Grace of God,</HI> which, as every one makes the Rule of their Actions, in both a moral and religious Conduct, it teaches us our Duty to God and one a|nother, by which we are brought under the Gover|nment of Chri&s;t, and thereby made Partakers of that Peace within, which may be ju&s;tly term'd the <HI>King|dom of Heaven within.</HI> So the Objections thus made by this forward Man, though weak and impertinent, gave Opportunity to explain the Doctrine of the Go&s;pel more clearly, &s;o that altho' &s;uch Objectors &s;eldom intend any Good, yet Good often comes out of their Objections.</P>
<P>From thence I travelled to <HI>Sandwich, Yarmouth, Scituate,</HI> and then to a Meeting where <HI>Michael Wan|ton</HI> lived, and &s;o for <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> vi&s;iting the Meetings to <HI>Lynn, Marblehead</HI> and <HI>Salem;</HI> but nothing hap|pened at any of the&s;e Meetings worthy of Note. I came to <HI>Newbury,</HI> the Town which I mention'd in my fir&s;t Journey, but there were very few Friends here now, not above nine or ten in all. The Peo|ple had Notice, but the Room was very &s;mall, and the Prie&s;t came, and did all he could to hinder the People from coming in, and made a very great Noi&s;e concerning the Danger of our Principles and Doc|trines.

of the <HI>Body.</HI> I bid him hold, and fir&s;t prove that we <HI>denied</HI> the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> and &s;o the re&s;t in order, as they came in cour&s;e: For I a&s;&s;erted, that <HI>we own|ed the Scripture;</HI> and he &s;aid, <HI>we did not:</HI> And I demanded Proof of him, otherwi&s;e he mu&s;t be con|cluded a fal&s;e Accu&s;er.

I told him his Meeting-hou&s;e was more proper for &s;uch a Conference than his Clo&s;et, and there I would meet him when he plea&s;ed; for I told him, that I had heard that he treated the Doc|trines held by us, in his Pulpit, very unhand&s;omely, where he knew none d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d to oppo&s;e him, and if he would clear the&s;e Things up, I &s;hould be plea&s;|ed with an Opportunity to hear him do it in as pub|lic a Way as he had de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">amed us, either to make Proof of his Charges, or retract them; but he would not permit any &s;uch Things: He had charged Friends with <HI>denying the Scriptures, Chri&s;t,</HI> the <HI>Re&s;urrection of the Body,</HI> and that we pretended to <HI>Revelation now,</HI> although, as he &s;aid, it was cea&s;ed &s;ome Generati|ons &s;ince But he being a hot, weak Man, ju&s;t &s;et

<P>From thence I went to <HI>Aim&s;bury, Hampton,</HI> &amp;c. it was <HI>Hampton</HI> Monthly-meeting, which held but one Day. I was concerned to &s;tir up Friends to keep a faithful Record of all their Sufferings, to be made U&s;e of as Occa&s;ion might require, the Prie&s;ts Hear|ers making Spoil of Friends Goods to &s;upport their own fal&s;e Mini&s;try, with which &s;ome People were &s;o unea&s;y and oppre&s;s'd, that Complaints in almo&s;t every Town&s;hip appeared again&s;t them.</P>
<P>From thence I came to <HI>Dover,</HI> it was their Month|ly-meeting likewi&s;e: They were very raw, and man|aged their Affairs but indifferently, chiefly occa&s;ion|ed for want of &s;ome better Hands to write and keep their Books in Order. I was likewi&s;e concerned here to put them upon recording their Sufferings, and in a Way how to do it; for they were Sufferers not only on Account of the hireling Preachers, to maintain them in their Pride and Idlene&s;s, but al&s;o on the Account of bearing Arms, which was like|wi&s;e pretty heavy upon them in &s;ome Towns; but then in others their Neighbours were moderate, and made not much ado about them: But &s;ome did com|pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to pay off their Quota about bearing of Arms, who would not pay a Doit to the Par&s;on, they &s;ee|ing
<PB N="178" REF="008308_0185_102E89194AA1C570">
very clearly, that they were wrong, and preach|ed them&s;elves, and for them&s;elves. We had a fine agreeable Time in Conference, and there appeared both great Sincerity and Innocency among&s;t them; I was at their <HI>Fir&s;t-day</HI> Meeting, which was very large, and to great Satisfaction. After Meeting, finding that &s;ome Mi&s;under&s;tanding was among&s;t them about the Building of a Meeting-hou&s;e, we got them together, (my dear Friend <HI>Nathaniel Star|buck</HI> from <HI>Nantucket</HI> being &s;till with me) and we endeavoured and per&s;uaded them to Peace and Love, in which we were &s;ucce&s;sful: We appointed a Meeting to be held there, which was attended by all, or the greate&s;t Part of Friends of that Monthly-meeting, and a fine comfortable Opportunity we had, and they &s;eemed all very ea&s;y and reconciled one to another.</P>
<P>Thence I went to <HI>Strawberry-bank,</HI> otherwi&s;e called <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> but it proved an un&s;uitable Time, becau&s;e all the Country was come together, the Mi|litary Part e&s;pecially, with all their Arms and Ac|coutrements of War, to proclaim King GEORGE the <HI>Second,</HI> (News being come three Weeks before, that his Father died on his Way to <HI>Hanover</HI>) and al|&s;o on Account of the Peace that was concluded with the <HI>Indians:</HI> However, notwith&s;tanding the va&s;t Crowd and Hurry, we had a very quiet, though but &s;mall Meeting; and Notice being whi&s;pered, that there was to be a Marriage at <HI>Dover</HI> on a Day appointed, many in Curio&s;ity came to it, and the People &s;eemed much plea&s;ed with our Way of Mar|rying, few of them having been at any before. All
<PB N="179" REF="008308_0186_102E891D5C160870">
ended quiet, without any Di&s;pute. Then we had another Meeting at the new Meeting-hou&s;e, after which I found a Concern to de&s;ire an Opportunity with the Mini&s;ters and Elders, which was very rea|dily granted; and I was much concerned to reque&s;t and advi&s;e both the Mini&s;ters and Elders, to endea|vour to keep in the Unity of the Spirit among&s;t them|&s;elves, that they might be good Examples to the Flock, over which they were to watch, and to be ready and willing to admini&s;ter good Coun&s;el, which the Apo&s;tle calls <HI>feeding of the Flock;</HI> and this he recommends to the Elders as their Bu&s;ine&s;s: And that the Mini&s;ters look well to their Gifts, carefully avoiding either to abridge or enlarge in their Mini|&s;try beyond the true Opening of Life in them&s;elves, labouring with Diligence and Humility to evince the Truth of their Words by their own Conduct, that no Blemi&s;h or Spot might appear among&s;t them, nor any ju&s;t Ground to reproach them with teach|ing others what they did not practi&s;e them&s;elves, being careful in Conduct, that their Words and Ac|tions might be agreeable; this would give Autho|rity to their Mini&s;try, and attract Honour and Re|&s;pect from their Hearers.</P>
<P>From thence I went to vi&s;it the Widow <HI>Han&s;on,</HI> who had been taken into Captivity by the <HI>Indians,</HI> an Account of which I took from her own Mouth, being in Sub&s;tance as followeth: <Q>Eleven naked <HI>Indians</HI> came with Violence upon the Family, and killed two of the Children ju&s;t as they entred the Hou&s;e; two little Boys more being at Play behind the Hou&s;e, when they heard the Noi&s;e, came
<PB N="180" REF="008308_0187_102E892009E99518">
running in great Surprize, the younger of whom could not be prevailed with to moderate his Grief, whereupon one of the <HI>Indians</HI> with a <HI>Tomhawk</HI> (a little Hatchet) &s;truck him on the Head and kil|led the poor Child, to rid them&s;elves of the Noi&s;e, and to prevent their being di&s;covered, and to &s;trike the greater Terror upon tho&s;e in the Hou&s;e. Then they rifled the Hou&s;e of what they thought pro|per to carry away. They took the poor Woman, who had lain in but two Weeks, along with them by Force and Violence, with her little Infant, and two Daughters, one Son, and a Servant Maid; it being in the Afternoon, the <HI>Indians</HI> were in a great Hurry to force them away as far as they could that Night, for fear of being pur&s;ued, and the Pri&s;oners retaken. Thus they travelled for twenty Days, pa&s;&s;ing through many Lakes and Rivers; notwith&s;tanding which they took no Cold, but their Health was pre&s;erved.</Q> The incredible and &s;evere Trials the poor Woman and her Children went through, during their Captivity, I cannot here di&s;|cribe to the full, in all which they were remarkably favour'd by Providence, induring hard Labour, though they were drove to very great Straits for want of Provi&s;ions, being nece&s;&s;iated to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">at old Bear and Beaver-&s;kin Match-coats, fir&s;t &s;ingeing the Hair off. After my Return to <HI>Europe,</HI> I &s;aw at <HI>Dublin</HI> a Re|lation of this extraordinary Affair in a printed Nar|rative, which was brought over by a Friend from <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>Now being ea&s;y to leave the&s;e Parts for the pre&s;ent, I returned towards <HI>Hampton,</HI> but in the Way had a
<PB N="181" REF="008308_0188_102E78BA9C05C848">
comfortable Meeting at a Town called <HI>Stratham,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Hamton, A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m&s;bury, Haverill</HI> and <HI>Newbury,</HI> the Place where the Prie&s;t before had given &s;o much Di&s;turbance; but although he had Notice of the Meet|ing, he came not, and but a very few of his People; it was but a &s;mall Meeting, yet peaceable.</P>
<P>Then I returned to <HI>Lynn,</HI> where was a Yearly-meeting, which was very large, and I had good Service in it. Then to <HI>Salem,</HI> it being their Yearly-meeting for Wor&s;hip, and Quarterly-meeting for Di&s;cipline, which was exceeding large; they had a Meeting of Mini&s;ters and Elders, in which I was much enlarged in Advice to both: Then came on the Quarterly-meeting, in which for want of better Writers and Method, they were &s;omewhat deficient in their Bu&s;ine&s;s, whereby it became tedious to them&s;elves; I endeavoured to put them in a better Method, which they took very kindly and well: And after this was ended, a Parting-meeting of Wor|&s;hip came on, which was very large, and was at|tended by abundance of <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> and other Peo|ple: I was very much drawn forth into various Branches of Doctrine, and the Meeting ended well; no Cavil or Di&s;pute ari&s;ing, which they are but too liable to. I was informed, that what I had deliver|ed was taken down in Writing, but I never &s;aw it tho' a Friend afterwards had a Sight of it, and the Writer &s;aid, he did it with a View to have it printed by Sub&s;cription, and get &s;omething by it.</P>
<P>Not finding my&s;elf clear, I returned back with Friends to <HI>Haverill,</HI> and next Day had a comfortable little Meeting: Thence to <HI>Hampton</HI> and <HI>Dover,</HI> it was Yearly-meeting there: They having in almo&s;t
<PB N="182" REF="008308_0189_102E89236D9B27D8">
every Place once a Year a General-meeting, which they call a Yearly-meeting, and by this popular Ti|tle abundance more People come together, in Ex|pectation of &s;omething extraordinary there to be met with; it held two Days, and was to very good Content. Next Day, I had a Meeting on <HI>Kittery|&s;ide,</HI> in an old Meeting-hou&s;e that the <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> had erected, but not being in &s;o convenient a Place for them, they had le&s;t it. Many, both Friends and others came, and before it was quite gathered, the Prie&s;t with a large Company came in, and immedi|ately began to pray, continuing a long Time: But as &s;oon as he had done, I &s;poke to the People with, &s;ome Authority, which &s;eem'd to daunt the Prie&s;t, who it was thought intended to have taken up all the Time him&s;elf, and to have put us by; if he had &s;ucceeded, they would have gloried and triumph'd much, but therein they were di&s;appointed. In the Cour&s;e of my Mini&s;try, I in&s;i&s;ted on the Danger of <HI>neglecting</HI> the Work of our Salvation, &s;peaking cau|tiou&s;ly, that &s;uch an <HI>Omi&s;&s;ion</HI> might be irreparable. The Prie&s;t replying, &s;aid, that &s;hould be expre&s;s'd, <HI>will be irreparable.</HI> I de&s;ired him not to di&s;turb us, for we did not him; and repeating my Words over again, with this Addition, I dare not &s;peak <HI>conclu&s;ively</HI> of the Mercy of God, who is able by Chri&s;t to &s;ave us at the <HI>Hour of Death.</HI> After this he was &s;ilent, only writing when he thought he had any Room to cavil, but he was &s;oon weary, for I was very &s;trong both in Power and Doctrine, and great Tenderne&s;s was a|mong the People, which was &s;trange to him, and Scripture came very apt to confirm my Doctrine;
<PB N="183" REF="008308_0190_102E892882BE6098">
the Prie&s;t growing weary would &s;tay no longer, but walked off, inviting the People to go with him, but very few went. We had a very good &s;ervice|able Opportunity, the Meeting ended very quiet and well.</P>
<P>Next Day I went to <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> having been there before at an improper Time, but now we had an ex|cellent Meeting; then I was at the new Meeting-hou&s;e, about which they had had &s;ome Unea&s;ine&s;s; we had a Meeting to very good Satisfaction, and Friends appeared well reconciled. Then I went once more to vi&s;it the Widow <HI>Han&s;on</HI> at <HI>Knox march,</HI> that had, as before, been taken Captive. From thence to <HI>Stratham,</HI> having had a Meeting there two or three Weeks before, and the People were then very much affected: But the Prie&s;t hearing of it, was very unea&s;y, and went among&s;t his Hearers, beg|ging and praying them not to conver&s;e with the <HI>Quakers,</HI> if they could avoid it, &s;o that we had but few that came, among&s;t whom was a Man in Drink, that did cavil, and would pretend to a Di&s;putation, but he was &s;o much in Liquor that he rambled in his Di&s;cour&s;e, and know not what he &s;aid; he went away in a Rage, cur&s;ing as he went along. Thence I came to <HI>Hampton,</HI> and <HI>Aim&s;bury,</HI> and had Meet|ings at both Places. Thence to <HI>Newbury</HI> and had a Meeting, to which the Prie&s;t was again invited, but he did not come near us. Next Day I was at their Monthly-meeting, which was but dull. Next Day I was up in the Woods, at a new Place, where there were many People, and we had a good Meet|ing. Next Day I was at a Marriage, which was

Next Day I went to <HI>Lynn,</HI> had &s;undry Meetings at fre&s;h Places about <HI>Lynn, Marblehead, Salem,</HI> and in &s;everal lit|tle Villages towards <HI>Bo&s;ton:</HI> Taking my leave of Friends in that Part of the Country, I came to <HI>Bo&s;|ton,</HI> and had two Meetings there. Then I went to <HI>Mendam, Providence</HI> and <HI>Swan&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y,</HI> alias <HI>Wickapin|&s;ett,</HI> and had Meetings; and then to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">uate</HI> Year|ly-meeting, which held two Days, but nothing hap|pen'd uncommon, &s;ave that the Parting-meeting at <HI>Pembrook</HI> was very large, very open and to good Satisfaction: I had a &s;mall Meeting at <HI>Hanover</HI> and <HI>Free-town,</HI> and &s;o back to <HI>Wickapin&s;ett</HI> again, and then for <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> Quarterly-meeting: The fir&s;t Day I had &s;omething to &s;ay to the Mini&s;ters and El|ders about the <HI>Di&s;cipline of the Church,</HI> warning them to look diligently to the Flock; and &s;etting them know, that the Apo&s;tacy was partly occa&s;ioned thro' the Mini&s;ters and Elders neglecting their Duty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Next Day was the Meeting of Mini&s;ters and Elders,
<PB N="185" REF="008308_0192_102E892CE759DA40">
and I was very much drawn forth to both. Then I had a Meeting at <HI>Providence</HI> middle Meeting-hou&s;e, which was &s;mall, but pretty well. then by <HI>Mendam</HI> I went to <HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> and had a &s;weet good Time with a few &s;eeking People, and in the Evening I had a long Conference with a young Wo|man about the <HI>Sabbath,</HI> the <HI>Sacraments,</HI> (&s;o call'd) and &s;ome other Points; in all which &s;he &s;eemed very tender, and in a good Frame. I told her, I would not treat her as a Di&s;putant, in an adver&s;e Temper, but as a Si&s;ter and Friend in the &s;ame Faith in Degree: But &s;he complained much of the Bondage of her Education, and lamented her Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>From thence I went to <HI>Oxford,</HI> where was no Meeting &s;ettled, nor any Friend in that Place; the Prie&s;ts did all that in them lay to hinder the People from coming to hear Friends, when any came a|mong&s;t them, if they knew it; however, we had a good Opportunity. Thence to the Meeting in that great Hou&s;e, not far from <HI>Seth Aldrich</HI>'s, which was a fine full and comfortable Meeting. Then to the Upper Meeting-hou&s;e, and &s;o to <HI>Mo&s;hantatuck,</HI> and to <HI>Warwick,</HI> and had Meetings in tho&s;e Places. I was de&s;ired to &s;tay to attend a Di&s;pute. One <HI>Hugh Adams,</HI> a Prie&s;t, had challenged Friends, he having undertaken to prove <HI>Infant-&s;prinkling</HI> from Scripture, to be an Ordinance of Chri&s;t. But in the Proof he came off very lamely, <HI>Samuel Aldrich,</HI> an excellent and ingenious Di&s;putant, was by ap|pointment to manage the Argument on Friends Side, and none el&s;e: But &s;uch Arguments the Prie&s;t
<PB N="185" REF="008308_0193_102E892E69633700">
brought for their <HI>Sprinkling</HI> as were entirely new to the Audience; one was, the <HI>Spray</HI> of the Red Sea, when the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> went through it, by the &s;trength of the Wind <HI>&s;prinkling</HI> the Children, <HI>viz.</HI> Infants, as well as old People; and as the A|po&s;tle &s;aid, <HI>They were all baptized in the Cloud, and in the Sea.</HI> This was full Proof of me Point for <HI>In|fant-&s;prinkling,</HI> he &s;aid. But <HI>Samuel</HI> made an ex|cellent &s;hort Di&s;cour&s;e on the Text, very much to the Purpo&s;e, and he had &s;o much the A&s;cendant in the Argument on every Branch, that the Prie&s;t lo&s;t Ground, and &s;everal of his Brethren being there were much a&s;hamed of him.</P>
<P>Then I returned back to <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Coak&s;et</HI> Yearly-meeting, which was very large; and then to <HI>Dartmouth</HI> Yearly-meeting, which was like|wi&s;e very large, and that Evening was a Meeting of Mini&s;ters, wherein I had much to &s;ay on &s;undry Heads proper to them: And next Day being the Yearly-meeting, it was very large, as before, there being a great Re&s;ort of People many Miles round. It held three Days, and ended to the Satisfaction of mo&s;t. This Evening, as I was going to Bed, about ten at Night, there was an exceeding great Earth|quake, that made a Noi&s;e like the driving of Carts or Waggons on an uneven Cau&s;eway; it continued about two Minutes, to the great Surprize of the People. It was felt about fifteen hundred Miles, as was after computed, and as was thought by Calcu|lation, was not quite three Hours in going that Space.</P>
<P>From thence I went into the I&s;land; and took my la&s;t Farewell of my Friends in that Part of

the Country, having made a thorough Vi&s;it a|mong&s;t them. The Weather by this Time grew very cold, it being the Beginning of the <HI>Ninth Month;</HI> however, I proceeded to <HI>Connecticut, James-town, Kings-town,</HI> and to <HI>Greenwich</HI> Month|ly-meeting. From thence <HI>Seth Aldrich, John Ca&s;ey, John Earle,</HI> and <HI>Peleg Spencer,</HI> accompanied me, and we travelled into the <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> Country; and fir&s;t, at a Town called <HI>Pre&s;ton,</HI> we had a &s;mall Meeting, and hearing of a Funeral about three Miles off, we went thither; the People (who, as we apprehended were <HI>Bapti&s;ts</HI>) &s;eemed much &s;urprized, and our not joining a young Man who prayed among&s;t them, made them look more &s;hyly on us; the poor Man &s;eemed in Con|fu&s;ion: But when he had done, we had a fine Opportunity to good Satisfaction. Then we took our Journey towards <HI>New-London,</HI> and on the Way had a &s;mall Opportunity among&s;t &s;ome <HI>Pre&s;byterians;</HI> &s;uch of them who were bigotted that Way, were hard to &s;peak to about the <HI>in|ward Work,</HI> they could not receive it. Thence to <HI>New-London</HI> on <HI>Groton</HI> Side, to one <HI>James Smith</HI>'s who was one of <HI>Rogers</HI>'s Kind of <HI>Bapti&s;ts,</HI> but his Wife was convinced, and they were under great Per&s;ecution by the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> both in Body and Goods. I had a Meeting at <HI>John Rogers</HI>'s on <HI>New-London</HI> Side, and he objected again&s;t the <HI>Univer|&s;ality</HI> of the Light that &s;aves, and about Bapti&s;m; he had much to &s;ay for the Continuance of Water-Bapti&s;m, but at the &s;ame Time would allow, that there was <HI>no real &s;piritual Benefit</HI> in it at all; and
<PB N="187" REF="008308_0195_102E8936271D7168">
he a&s;&s;erted, that that Light which condemns for Evil, was but the Tree of Knowledge and <HI>not &s;av|ing;</HI> but Chri&s;t's Light which &s;aves, was <HI>another Thing;</HI> endeavouring hereby to divide between the Light that <HI>condemns,</HI> and that which <HI>&s;aves,</HI> making them two different Principles from each other. I took the Bible, and turning to the fir&s;t of <HI>John</HI> the Evangeli&s;t, &s;hewed him, that the Light there &s;poken of, as the Divinity of Chri&s;t the Saviour of the World, was the &s;ame Prin|ciple that <HI>condemned</HI> the Di&s;obedient, and <HI>ju&s;tified</HI> the Righteous; the Principle was not divided in it&s;elf, nor was it two Principles, but one and the &s;ame in all: And though the Operation of this one Light differed, that Difference, it was plain, was not in the Light it&s;elf, but in the different Object on which it did operate; as for Example, the &s;ame Heat of the Sun that <HI>&s;oftens</HI> Wax, will <HI>harden</HI> Clay; but this argues not two different Qualities in the Heat of the Sun, though the Effect of its Heat is different on Wax and Clay: By which (although this, or but few Allegories will hold throughout) the People &s;aw, that his <HI>Notion</HI> of two different Lights, one <HI>&s;aving,</HI> the other <HI>con|demning,</HI> had no Foundation in the Text. Then as to <HI>Bapti&s;m,</HI> he divided the In&s;titution into three Parts; <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> from <HI>John; &s;econdly,</HI> from the Apo&s;tles <HI>practi&s;ing</HI> it; and <HI>thirdly,</HI> from <HI>Mat.</HI> xxviii. 19. But I told him, as he had already allowed that there was no real &s;piritual Advantage in outward Water-Bapti&s;m, his imaginary Divi&s;ion of the In&s;ti|tution fell of cour&s;e; for 'twas again&s;t Rea&s;on to &s;up|po&s;e
<PB N="188" REF="008308_0196_102E8937AC9237A0">
any Thing <HI>ordained</HI> or <HI>in&s;tituted</HI> by Chri&s;t, to be u&s;ed in his Church by Believers, could be of no <HI>real Service;</HI> but thou allowe&s;t that Bapti&s;m with Water is of no <HI>real Service</HI> therefore it's <HI>no In&s;titu|tion</HI> of Chri&s;t: But to conclude this Head, we may comparatively with the Apo&s;tle &s;ay, That it's not the <HI>outward</HI> Part of <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> or <HI>Bapti&s;m,</HI> will do any good to Believers, but in reality he is a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> that is one <HI>inwardly:</HI> And Bapti&s;m is that of the <HI>Heart,</HI> and not that of the <HI>Letter,</HI> that is really <HI>&s;er|viceable</HI> and <HI>&s;aving.</HI> Thus we ended this Confer|ence; but he was full of Words, and confu&s;ed in his Notions.</P>
<P>I had then another Meeting at <HI>Groton,</HI> though but &s;mall; after that we had an Evening-meeting at one <HI>John Wood</HI>'s, which was the be&s;t we had among&s;t that People, where &s;ome Objections were made again&s;t <HI>publick Prayer</HI> but their Objections were &s;oon removed. And afterwards at <HI>Colche&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Hebron</HI> we had &s;ome good Meetings among&s;t the People, tho' it was very difficult to get a Place to meet in at the former: But a Man of Re&s;olution offered a Place, and there being a Town-meeting that Day, we had a large Compa|ny, who were very &s;ober, no Cavilling or Di&s;putes in the lea&s;t. Then we came to <HI>Sea-brook</HI> and <HI>Kil|ling&s;worth,</HI> and had Meetings among&s;t a People who had &s;eparated them&s;elves from the <HI>Pre&s;byteri|ans,</HI> and inclined to the <HI>Bapti&s;ts,</HI> and were gett|ing into a lifele&s;s Form of &s;inging, and expound|ing in their own Way and carnal Manner, which was likely to be a Snare to their Hurt: We ap|pointed

another Meeting among&s;t them, which was but &s;mall, all my Friends &s;ave <HI>John Ca&s;ey</HI> and <HI>John Earle</HI> having left me.

I was glad and comforted to be among&s;t our Friends again, having been &s;o long from them, they being much more agreeable to me than other People.

and Elders, (for there were there the greate&s;t Part of the Mini&s;ters in the Province, and &s;everal from <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> Side) it was the bigge&s;t Meet|ing of Mini&s;ters I ever was at in tho&s;e Parts, the Time of the Year con&s;ider'd, and I was very much enlarged in Coun&s;el and Advice to them, being never &s;o opened on &s;undry Heads before; and in the Meeting of Bu&s;ine&s;s I was drawn forth to &s;hew the Qualifications of a right and true Elder, and the Excellency of right Govern|ment in the Church, which mu&s;t fir&s;t be known in our own Minds; for &s;uch who have not the Government of their own Spirits, are not fit to undertake the Government of others.

<P>Then I came into <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> to <HI>Wright's-Town,</HI> was at their Meeting of Mini&s;ters, and had a very agreeable Time with them, wherein was &s;hewn the Danger of Murmuring at the &s;eeming Weakne&s;s of our Gifts to a Degree of Dejection, and Neglect to exerci&s;e our&s;elves in them, &s;hewing that every Gift of the Mini&s;try was of great Service, though but &s;mall in compari&s;on of others, and had a great Beauty in it, and that we ought by no means to flight and neglect it, but to think well, and be thankful that the Father of Spirits hath given us a Gift, though but &s;mall. And on the other hand,
<PB N="196" REF="008308_0203_102F6C0029D3B7C8">
to exhort &s;uch as had a more elegant Mini&s;try, not to overvalue them&s;elves upon their Gifts, but in Hu|mility and with thankful Hearts render the Ho|nour and Prai&s;e where due, not looking with an Eye of Contempt on their &s;uppo&s;ed inferior Bre|thren and Si&s;ters, but in Love preferring each other to them&s;elves, more e&s;pecially con&s;idering, that mean and plain Diet, handled by Per&s;ons who have clean Hands, and clean Garments, though but mean to look at, yet the Cleanne&s;s of their Hands and Gar|ments, as al&s;o the Diet, though plain, put in decent Order renders what they have to offer very agreea|ble and acceptable to the Hungry, and for others we need not be &s;o careful.

&s;hew the Difference between the true and fal&s;e Church, &s;etting them Side by Side, that they might judge for them&s;elves.

<P>Now our Men, who were all pre&s;erved from any other Damage, &s;aving the taking of Cold, which we all felt the Effect of to a great Degree, went about putting the Rigging to rights again, which took up a full Week before we could make Sail, the Wind blowing &s;trong and variable; and when they had got Things in a good Condition the Wind was again&s;t us for &s;everal Days, which made us thoughtful to take Care of what Water and Provi&s;ion we had, that we might not be &s;urprized with Want, when we had no Power to arm again&s;t it.

<P>From <HI>Ro&s;combe</HI> I came to <HI>Long-Sutton,</HI> and had a &s;mall Meeting; thence to <HI>Sherborne</HI> Meeting, the &s;malle&s;t I ever was at, or had in that Place, and to but little Satisfaction; the Smallne&s;s of the Number was much owing to the want of Notice to the Town's People; from thence to a Funeral at <HI>Yeovill,</HI> of an antient Woman of ninety-five and upwards; a large Company of Neighbours attended the Corps, and we had a good Time, the People being very &s;erious, and &s;eemed edified with what was &s;poken; from thence I came Home, it being the 16th of the <HI>Twelfth-Month</HI> 1747.</P>
<P>I &s;taid at Home, and vi&s;ited the neighbouring Meet|ings until the 2d of the <HI>Third-Month</HI> 1748, and then went towards <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Yearly-meeting, but had no Meeting till I came there, except the Monthly-meet|ing for the North Divi&s;ion of the County of <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> and though it was very &s;mall, the Affairs thereof were conducted with Prudence and Judgment; thence to <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Yearly-meeting, which was to ge|neral Satisfaction.</P>
<P>From <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> I went to <HI>Bath,</HI> and had a &s;mall Meeting, and &s;o to <HI>Pickwick;</HI> I had a &s;mall Meet|ing

<P>From <HI>Ip&s;wich</HI> I went to <HI>Woodbridge,</HI> it being the Quarterly-meeting for the County of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> and there being &s;ome Unea&s;ine&s;s among&s;t them, Friends were concerned to advi&s;e them to a Reconciliation, le&s;t by continuing in their Unea&s;ine&s;s, they &s;hould be wounded by a Breach of Union and Affection. The Meeting, by Adjournment, held all Day, and Friends &s;eemed in a tolerable Sweetne&s;s and Conde&s;cention one to another, though a party contentious Spirit had too much got in among them. Next Morning was a Meeting of Mini&s;ters, to good Satisfaction; and then the Yearly-meetings of Wor&s;hip followed, which were exceeding large, and the Parting-meet|ing the Day following; they were all very much to Satisfaction: In the Parting-meeting I was much enlarged on the <HI>progre&s;&s;ive Advancement</HI> in a living and &s;aving Faith, which is the very Life of true Re|ligion; and we had a &s;mall Meeting the Day fol|lowing, being their Weekly-meeting. Then I went to <HI>Brandon, Edmund Peckover</HI> being with me, and he had very good Service, and the Meeting ended well; then I went back to <HI>Woodbridge,</HI> and &s;taid o|ver <HI>Fir&s;t-day,</HI> but there were very few be&s;ides Friends, though it was expected the la&s;t Meeting would have been large, but for want of Notice it was not.

<P>From <HI>Norwich</HI> I went to <HI>Lamas</HI> General-meeting, which was very large, too much for the Hou&s;e to contain, but the People were very quiet; thence back to <HI>Norwich,</HI> &s;taid there the Week-day and <HI>Fir&s;t-day</HI> Meetings following, where I had ten Meetings, though in two of them I had Nothing to &s;ay, and the Meetings were mo&s;tly very large and to good Purpo&s;e, being full enough for my natural Strength to go thro' with; but thankful and glad I was, find|ing inward Strength and A&s;&s;i&s;tance every Day to help me through &s;o well, to my own Comfort and his Prai&s;e, who is God ble&s;&s;ed for ever; and he has gi|ven me Faith to believe, that &s;o long as he engages my Mind in the Work of the Mini&s;try, he will give a fre&s;h Supply of Strength, both inward and outward, adequate to his Requirings.

<P>_IT has been repeatedly revived in my Mind, to leave the following Account concerning my dear Father WILLIAM RICHARDSON, having al&s;o &s;een &s;omething of his own in Manu&s;cript, concerning his <HI>Convincement,</HI> with Remarks on &s;ome other Things; but I being young when he died, did not their much heed it, and when I would gladly have &s;een it for my own Satisfaction, I could not, nor as yet can meet with it; therefore,</P>
<P>Ina&s;much as my Father was early convinced of the Truth, a Sufferer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or it, and bore a public Te&s;timony to it, I found it my Duty, as near as I could remem|ber the Contents thereof, to leave this &s;hort Account concerning him, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

He was born at <HI>North-Cave,</HI> in the Ea&s;t Part of <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> in the Year 1624, of hone&s;t Parents, and of good Repute, and was educated in the <HI>Ep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">pal</HI> Way being &s;oberly inclined from his Childhood and upward, a Lover and Seeker after Purity and Virtue: And I have heard him &s;ay, gave his Mind much to Retirement, reading the holy Scriptures, breathing and &s;eeking after the Lord, e&s;pecially in the Fields, being by Calling a <HI>Shepherd;</HI> and it plea&s;ed the Lord to open his Under&s;tanding &s;o clearly, that he &s;aw and longed for a more excellent Di&s;pen&s;ation to come; and al&s;o &s;aw that the Prie&s;ts were wrong, and gene|rally proud and covetous, &s;o that he was weary with following them, and much weaned from them and all Company, except two or three Men who did meet with him, and &s;poke one unto are her concerning their inward Conditions, and what they had experi|enced of the Lord's Dealings with them. This was before they had heard of the Name <HI>Quaker,</HI> os it was in a &s;hort Time after given to the People which the Lord rai&s;ed up to give Te&s;timony of the notable and antient, yet newly revived and ble&s;&s;ed Di&s;pen&s;ation of Chri&s;t's Coming, and Manife&s;tation by the holy Spirit, inwardly in the Hearts and Minds of the Children of Men, in order to enlighten, quicken, &s;anctify, and &s;ave them from Darkne&s;s, Death, Ig|norance and Sin, that they might be made capable of obeying, wor&s;hiping and glorifying the great God and Sanctifier of them.</P>
<P>And as my Father was thus waiting and looking for a more general breaking &s;oath of this glorious, powerful and Go&s;pel-day, which had in a good de|gree

But having left the dar&s;t Watchmen, of whom they u&s;ed to enquire, they now met with their Beloved at home, in their own Bo&s;oms; renowned be the great Name of the Lord, now and for ever.</P>
<P>Thus the hearing and receiving the ever ble&s;&s;ed Truth, was as the Seed, or Word of the Kingdom, &s;own in the <HI>gold Ground,</HI> or hone&s;t Hearts of Men, which took Root downward and &s;prang upward, and brought forth Fruit in &s;ome <HI>thirty,</HI> in &s;ome <HI>&s;ixty,</HI> and in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> an <HI>hundred Fold,</HI> to the Prai&s;e of the great and good Hu&s;bandman.</P>
<P>My &s;aid Father was early rai&s;ed up to bear a pub|lic Te&s;timony, which was living and acceptable to Friends, but was &s;o much attended with Weakne&s;s of Body for many Years, that he went little abroad in the Work of the Mini&s;try. He &s;uffered patiently the Spoiling of his Goods, and Impri&s;onment of his weakly Body, in the great and more general Impri|&s;onment; he not only believed in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, but &s;uffered for him; he was a good Neighbour, a lov|ing Hu&s;band, and a tender Father over all that was good, but &s;evere to all that which was wrong, and was for Judgment, without Re&s;pect of Per&s;ons, and

&s;pared it not even to his own Children; and e&s;peci|ally he was much concerned for me, <HI>for,</HI> as he &s;aid, <HI>I was the wilde&s;t of them;</HI> and as he lived well, and believed in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, I doubt not but he has fi|ni&s;hed his Cour&s;e in the Love and Favour of God, is entered into Man&s;ion of Glory, and is at Re&s;t with all the Faithful who <HI>loved not their Lives unto Death,</HI> but rather hated them in Compari&s;on of that endeared and unfeigned Love the bore to God the Father, and to Je&s;us Chri&s;t his dear and well-beloved Son; who died for them, and al&s;o for the whole World.</P>
<P>He departed this Life in 1679, aged about fifty-five Years, and was decently b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed in Friends bu|rying Place in <HI>Hatham,</HI> near <HI>Cave,</HI> where he was born.</P>

<P>I was young when my Father died, not above thirteen Years of Age, yet the Lord was at work by his Light, Grace and holy Spirit in my Heart, but I knew not then what it was which inwardly di&s;|quieted my Mind, when any Thing which was evil did prevail over the Good in me, which it oftentimes did, for want of taking heed to that of God in my

<P>I come now to the Particulars which &s;tood in my Way of an&s;wering the Lord's Commands &s;o fully as &s;ometimes I &s;hould have done; <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> a <HI>violent Hu|mour</HI> fell into one of my Legs &s;oon after I was bound Apprentice, which I with others thought was much occa&s;ioned by hard U&s;age, Heats and Colds, and many Surfeits, even from my Infancy; which Lame|ne&s;s held me about two Years, and I &s;uffered much by the &s;aid Leg, and it much di&s;couraged and dis|abled me.

<P>I was likewi&s;e in the&s;e Days under the Di&s;pen&s;a|tions of Openings and Vi&s;ions, and thought my&s;elf as it were upon <HI>Mount-Pi&s;gah,</HI> and &s;aw into the holy

<P>But although at times I had clear Sights into many heavenly Things, and al&s;o had at times comfortable Enjoyments of the living Pre&s;ence of God, yet I wanted to be more e&s;tabli&s;hed in the unchangeable Truth, which I had at times &s;ome comfortable feel|ing of; and in crying to the Lord, I found he in|clined unto me, and, as <HI>David</HI> &s;aid, <HI>he heard my Cries, and pluckt my Feet out of the Mire and Clay and &s;et them upon a Rock,</HI> that was higher than I, and in part <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed my Goings, and put a new Song into my Mouth, even high Prai&s;es unto the Lord for all his</HI>

After <HI>William</HI> had heard my Account, he fixed his

Eyes on me and &s;aid, <HI>Thou mu&s;t go back again to</HI> Co|ventry. I appeared unwilling, for two Rea&s;ons; <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> becau&s;e I thought I had cleared my&s;elf of that People. <HI>Secondly,</HI> I thought it not &s;afe to run my|&s;elf into Danger of Suffering, unle&s;s I was &s;atisfied the Lord required it of me. But <HI>William</HI> was po|&s;itive, and &s;aid <HI>I mu&s;t go, for there was a Service for me to do there.</HI> Upon a deliberate Con&s;ideration of the Matter, and a &s;eeking to the Lord to know his Will in it, I found my Way clear to go, and I had &s;ome Service and good Satisfaction, and left Friends nearer to one another than when I fir&s;t met with them; for there had been a Mi&s;under&s;tanding among&s;t &s;ome Friends in that City: So I came from thence to <HI>Tamworth,</HI> where there was a Difference, e&s;pecially betwixt two Friends; both of them had been &s;uch as had made &s;ome con&s;iderable Figure a|mong Friends: I felt it upon me to go to, the Man, to warn him of the Spirit of Prejudice and Envy, for it he gave Way to it, it would eat out his Love to Friends and Truth, and he would decline Meet|ings and come to nought, and turn his Back on the Truth; which came to be fulfilled, as I afterwards heard; for he became a loo&s;e Man, and li&s;ted him|&s;elf to be a Soldier. I was zealous for the Name of the Lord, and had a great Concern upon my Mind for the Promulgation of the Truth, and where I met with loo&s;e Profe&s;&s;ors of the Truth, it was a great Exerci&s;e to me.</P>
<P>When I returned home from this, and indeed from all my Journeys, I took Care what I well could, &s;o far as my weak Body was capable, to fall into
<PB N="34" REF="008308_0288_102F6D8BC5BE5A28">
Bu&s;ine&s;s, and not to loiter away my Time, neithe abroad nor at home. My weak Con&s;titution would not well bear the <HI>Weaving-trade,</HI> therefore I left it much again&s;t my Will; but I wrought upon Clock and Watch-work, and many other Things, which &s;upplied my Nece&s;&s;ities, the Lord allowing me as much Time at home as put me in a Condition rea|&s;onably fit for Travel, and then I was inclin'd to go to vi&s;it Friends. Many Things I omit, becau&s;e I am not willing to &s;well my Account too much.

<P>After the Lord had opened my Heart, and I came in part to under&s;tand the holy Scriptures, and to have a Feeling of that holy Spirit in which the holy Penmen wrote them, and a Sympathy with the Spi|rits and Excerci&s;es of the Righteous therein men|tioned, I took great Delight in reading them, and having a good Memory, could thereby the better deal with Prie&s;ts and with Profe&s;&s;ors. I had many Di&s;putes and Rea&s;onings with Prie&s;ts and Profe&s;&s;ors, of &s;everal Denominations, both in <HI>York&s;hire</HI> and o|ther Parts in my Travels, &s;o that through the&s;e Di&s;|putes, and much Reading, my Mind was rather too much in the <HI>Letter,</HI> and not altogether &s;o much in <HI>Spirit,</HI> and in <HI>Power,</HI> as it &s;hould have been; for which I met with a gentle Caution from the Lord, which was thus: I heard a Voice (from the Lord) as plain as if one had &s;poke to my outward Ear, <HI>The Fowls of the Air lodge in the Branches.</HI> This being repeated to me, I be&s;ought the Lord to &s;hew me what
<PB N="35" REF="008308_0289_102F6D8F95B524E8">
was the Meaning of that Voice which I heard; and the Lord, the mighty God, &s;hewed me in his con|de&s;cending Love, that the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> even all of them which were written as the holy Men were moved of the holy Gho&s;t, &s;prung from the <HI>living Root;</HI> yet tho&s;e who re&s;ted only in the <HI>Letter,</HI> and came not to be acquainted with, and live in, and mini&s;ter from the &s;ame <HI>holy Spirit,</HI> are outward; dead, dry, airy and fooli&s;h. This gentle Check was of great Service to me; not &s;o as to make me decline reading the Scriptures, but that I &s;hould not have over much Dependency on them; and to caution me again&s;t the Neglect of waiting for the Help of the holy Spirit, the Root and pure Spring of the right and living Mini&s;try which reaches the Heart, and carries the true Evidence with it to the Believers, that <HI>it is of God;</HI> which that of the Letter cannot do of it&s;elf. I tenderly de&s;ire that all concerned in this great Work of the Mini&s;try, may not be Mi|ni&s;ters of the Letter <HI>only,</HI> but of the Spirit al&s;o, and may &s;peak in the Demon&s;tration of the Spirit and of Power.

<P>My writing thus, from this gentle Check, con|cerning the <HI>Fowls</HI> and the <HI>Branches,</HI> &amp;c. is not with the lea&s;t Intention either to le&s;&s;en the holy Scriptures, or di&s;courage any from reading them; for I would have all true Chri&s;tians encouraged to be more con|ver&s;ant in them; yet with this Advice, <HI>kind Reader,</HI> from thy Well-wi&s;her and true Friend, to breath to, and truly &s;eek after the Lord for a Mea&s;ure of his holy and ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, the only Key and be&s;t Expo|&s;itor to open and truly expound them to thee, as by the &s;ame holy Spirit thy Mind and Under&s;tanding comes to be fitted and enlightened; and indeed the whole Ve&s;&s;el mu&s;t be brought into a Preparation to hold the heavenly Trea&s;ure, and not to mix the pure with the corrupt and impure: For without this en|lightning, preparing, opening, and &s;anctifying Gift of God's holy Grace and Spirit, Man can neither know the heavenly Power of God, nor yet the holy Scriptures aright, as he ought to know them; and for this Rea&s;on it hath &s;eemed good to God to hide the&s;e Things from the Learned, Wife and Prudent

of this World, that they &s;hould not pry into, nor find out the My&s;teries contained therein, unle&s;s they are &s;anctified, and called of God thereto; and <HI>as no Man knows the Things of a Man, &s;ave the Spirit of a Man that is in him;</HI> likewi&s;e <HI>the Things of God</HI> are not perceivable by Man, without the Help of the holy Spirit of God in Man.</P>
<P>Thus the Lord opened to me the true Meaning of the Parable of the <HI>Mu&s;tard-&s;eed,</HI> in this the Time of my Infancy as to the Mini&s;try, with which he &s;ent me forth into the World, that my Faith might &s;tand in the Lord alone, the Author and Fini&s;her, as well as Giver of the true and &s;aving Faith, even <HI>that Faith which works by Love,</HI> and <HI>gives Victory over the World;</HI> it was by and through the Power, Virtue and Efficacy of true Faith, <HI>which is the Gift of God,</HI> that the Elders in former Ages obtained, and now do obtain a good Report; it was in and through this Gift, that worthy <HI>Abel</HI> with his Offering was ac|cepted of God, although he was envied of his earth|ly and evil minded Brother <HI>Cain,</HI> and al&s;o by him &s;lain.

One Thing is worthy here to be in&s;erted, which had a &s;trange and a&s;toni&s;hing Effect upon my Mind, which was thus:</P>
<P>As I was walking in a plain Field in the fore Part of the Day, not far from the Sea, betwixt <HI>Brid|lington</HI> and <HI>Broynton,</HI> my Soul was in a deep Concern, and at that Time exerci&s;ed in Meditation on the Things of God, and al&s;o in fervent Prayers to him for Pre&s;ervation from every hurtful Thing; and a heavenly Frame my Mind was then brought into, for then I neither &s;aw Cloud over my Mind, nor yet any in the Firmament, for it appeared to me <HI>a Morn|ing without Clouds;</HI> tho' I had pa&s;&s;ed under many Clouds.

<P>NOW the Time came on for my going into <HI>America,</HI> having had a &s;ight of it about ten Years before; I al&s;o acquainted my Wife therewith about a Year before &s;he died, and I found it was like|ly to be a very near trial to her; &s;he was a virtuous, good Woman, but was taken away, and left me three &s;mall Children, the elde&s;t not above four Years old, the younge&s;t not much above one Month old, and I having but little of this World, rea&s;oned much about going, thinking my Circum&s;tances at pre&s;ent might excu&s;e me; my Intentions were good, in that I might not leave Things any way to the Di&s;|honour of the Truth: My innocent young Child was taken away when about a Year old; and &s;oon after, where ever I went, while I was awake, it &s;ounded in my Ears &s;everal Days and Nights, <HI>Now is the Time, New is the Time.</HI> My other two Chil|dren, Providence &s;o ordered it, that they were

placed to mine and Friends Satisfaction: I went through many Provings that no Man knew of, but I believe, when I am gathered to my Place, I &s;hall leave many Brethren behind me yet in mutability, that will read my Lines in their own Experience. I would not have any to mi&s;under&s;tand me, for as to my outward Circum&s;tances, I left no Debt, neither was I in a way of going backward in the World; for ever after I received the Knowledge of the Truth, I could not &s;ee what Pretence I could have to Re|ligion, if any &s;hould lo&s;e by me: I have often &s;aid, and been hearty in my Intentions, that <HI>rather than Truth &s;hould &s;uffer on that Score, I would live upon Bread and Water, and wear very mean Cloaths, and work very hard if I were able, and upon any mean, if but lawful Calling.</HI> It hath been Matter of Wonder to me, how any that appear to carry any Preten|&s;ions to Religion, dare run &s;uch great Ventures, &s;ome|time beyond their own Bottoms or Abilities; which to me hath always appeared an unwarrantable Ri&s;que; and, as I apprehend, Pride and O&s;tentation is much the Occa&s;ion of it, which are much again&s;t Truth, and Men are no better for their greatne&s;s, for the more plain, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> more humble we are, the more we re&s;emble humble Je&s;us, and his Religion, which he laboured to inculcate.

<P>Now I mu&s;t leave my little Children, and my very near Friends, and my native Country, and all for Chri&s;t and the Go&s;pel's &s;ake, without any &s;ini&s;ter End or View; and then I appealed to the Lord, in

the &s;implicity of my Heart, that <HI>he knew I was wil|ling to be at his Di&s;po&s;al,</HI> and <HI>what he had favoured me with, I could leave to him;</HI> yet whether what I had was &s;ufficient to defray mine and my two little ones nece&s;&s;ary Charges, was &s;omewhat in my way; and to &s;atisfy me in this Doubt, the Lord's Voice &s;ounded exceeding clear to that Sen&s;ation I was then endued with, &s;aying, <HI>Go and be faithful, and I will ble&s;s thee every way.</HI> Oh my Heart &s;eemed to me to melt, and my Spirit to di&s;&s;olve within me, and I &s;aid, <HI>Good is the Word of the Lord, thou ha&s;t not failed me in any of my great Straits and Trials to this Day; I have great Cau&s;e to tru&s;t in thee: Renowned be thy mo&s;t excellent Name, new and for ever.</HI></P>
<P>I parted with my Friends with much brokenne&s;s of Heart, and &s;et forwards on my Journey towards <HI>London,</HI> in order to take &s;hipping there, the 11th of the <HI>Eighth Month</HI> 1700; and when I, with my Companions <HI>Thomas Thomp&s;on, Jo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">h Langdale,</HI> and <HI>John E&s;taugh,</HI> with &s;ome other Friends, went on board a Ship in the River <HI>Thames,</HI> we had not been long there, and having con&s;idered our freedom about going in the Ship, it opened clearly in my Mind, in the Light, <HI>that I mu&s;t not go in that Ve&s;&s;el;</HI> and I &s;aid to the Friends, <HI>I could not go in her, for I &s;aw nothing but Death and Darkne&s;s there.</HI> The Ac|count of what afterwards happened to the Ship I had from two particular Friends, in two &s;everal Let|ters from <HI>London</HI> into <HI>America,</HI> wherein they expre&s;s'd a Thankfulne&s;s for our Deliverance, and magnified that Hand which wrought it, and pre&s;erved us from going in that Ship, which was lo&s;t near the I&s;lands

<P>Peradventure I may mention &s;ome Things that may appear to be of but little Moment, but I have &s;een the Divine Providence attend terrene Affairs, al|though they may appear of little con&s;equence to &s;ome; &s;uch as do not duly con&s;ider the&s;e Things, may make a wrong Application, and as the Cour&s;e of my Travels hath afforded variety of Trials and Tran&s;actions, which are in &s;ome Things very par|ticular, from whence ari&s;eth variety of Accounts, &s;o there hath been a Willingne&s;s in my Mind to favour &s;ome who have been de&s;irous of having me to leave a Journal of my Life, which I have com|plied with, as far as I can &s;ee my way clear in the Truth.</P>
<P>Then we went on board of another Ship called the ARUNDEL, <HI>Splenden Rand</HI> Ma&s;ter, in which we embarked the 17th of the <HI>Ninth Month</HI> 1700, and after many Storms, and much Sea-&s;ickne&s;s, not without &s;ome Conflicts of Spirit, more than I am free to expre&s;s, and a long Pa&s;&s;age, being near, &s;ix|teen Weeks upon the Sea, we arrived in the River <HI>Patuxent</HI> in <HI>Maryland,</HI> as near as I remember, the 5th or 6th of the <HI>Fir&s;t Month</HI> 1701, and my Heart was glad, and filled with Acknowledgments and Prai&s;es to the Lord, for bringing us &s;afe over the mighty Waters.</P>
<P>Now we left the Ship and Ma&s;ter, who was but a churli&s;h, ill-natur'd Man. I was very weak and low when I landed, both in Body and Mind, but the Lord helped me, and made my Journey and

After the fir&s;t or &s;econd Meeting we were at, <HI>John E&s;laugh</HI> being now my Companion, as we came near a great Hou&s;e in <HI>Maryland,</HI> I e&s;pied a little white Hor&s;e, the Sight of which put me in mind of a Dream I had on board the Ship before I land|ed, in which I thought <HI>I had got a little white Hor&s;e which carried me well, and many Miles;</HI> I &s;aid to the Friends with me, <HI>let us call here at this Hou&s;e,</HI> which we did, and upon Enquiry about a Hor&s;e, the Man &s;aid, <HI>he had none but a little white young Galloway,</HI> as he called it, which he was <HI>willing to &s;ell,</HI> and withal told us, <HI>it carried him one Day forty Miles,</HI> and a&s;ked 8<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> Sterling for it, and I had him 5<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> Ster|ling; the Man's Wife coming up the Pa&s;&s;age, heard what I had offered, and &s;he &s;aid to her Hu&s;band, <HI>it is enough;</HI> &s;o I had him, and a good Hor&s;e he proved, and carried me, by a moderate Computation, 4000 Miles.

<HI>Sarah Clement,</HI> who were virtuous Women, and lived near the Kingdom, and were of good Service in their Travels, and grew in Truth, which while with them I was &s;en&s;ible of: We travelled under great Care and Circum&s;pection, both for our own good, and avoiding Offence, as became our Places, and holy Profe&s;&s;ion, that in all Things we might adorn the Go&s;pel of the Kingdom, a Di&s;pen&s;ation of which was committed to us to preach unto others.

<P>I had great Openings in &s;everal Places in <HI>New-England,</HI> and it appeared clear to me, and &s;ome|times I &s;poke openly of it, that the Lord would ga|ther a great People to the &s;aving Knowledge of the Truth in his Time, notwith&s;tanding what many of our Friends had &s;uffered for the Name of the Lord, and Te&s;timony which they held in their Parts, from the Predece&s;&s;ors of the pre&s;ent Inhabitants: The View of the State of the&s;e Things, e&s;pecially the great Sufferings of many of our faithful Friends, put me in Mind of that &s;aying, that <HI>The Blood of the Martyrs is the Seed of the Church;</HI> and in this Ca&s;e, I believe it will be fulfilled in its Sea&s;on.</P>
<P>One Pa&s;&s;age happened, which I think not fit to pa&s;s over in &s;ilence: There came into one Meeting, ea&s;tward in <HI>New-England,</HI> a Man, who was Bro|ther to a <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> Prie&s;t, to oppo&s;e Friends, (who, as Friends &s;aid, had been often very trouble|&s;ome

in that Meeting) in the Beginning of the Meeting he de&s;ired to have Liberty <HI>to a&s;k &s;ome Que&s;|tions.</HI> I being a Stranger, and not having &s;o much as heard of the Man, nor any making Reply to him, I felt Liberty in the Truth to return the following An&s;wer in behalf of the Meeting, <HI>That I did appre|hend it was the De&s;ire of Friends, ina&s;much as the Meet|ing was appointed for the Wor&s;hip of God, and not for a&s;king of Que&s;tions, or controver&s;ies, that the chief Part &s;hould fir&s;t be an&s;wered; and I al&s;o thought the Meeting would be willing, in the Conclu&s;ion, to give him Liberty to a&s;k the Que&s;tions, if his Intent therein was for</HI> In|formation <HI>or</HI> Satisfaction, <HI>and not for</HI> Contention. Friends were &s;ilent, and the Man &s;ubmitted to what was propos'd, and a good Meeting we had, the Lord's heavenly Power and living Pre&s;ence being with us, and the Sub&s;tance was felt among us, and exalted over all the Shadows and Types; and Chri&s;t the true Bread and living Water, Light and Life of the World, was exalted that Day; and the mighty God and Fa|ther, with his beloved Son, through the Help of the holy Spirit, was glorified, who is worthy for ever.

<P>In this fir&s;t Vi&s;it while in <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> I met with &s;omething worthy of thy Notice, if thou art &s;uch a Reader as I wi&s;h thou may&s;t, which was thus: Being in <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> &s;everal Friends came to me in &s;ome of the Intervals of the Yearly-Meeting, (for it held &s;everal Days, both for Wor&s;hip and Di&s;|cipline) to enquire whether it was u&s;ual to let the Young, and &s;uch as had but appear'd little in Te&s;ti|mony in our Parts of the World, come into Meet|ings of publick Friends?

<P>This Meeting was one not to be forgotten, becau&s;e of the eminent Vi&s;itation from the Lord that was upon us in it; I have not often &s;een the like; I que&s;tion if there were any dry Cheeks for &s;ometime in it; and the Manner of the working of the heavenly Power was remarkable, in order to the &s;anctifying and preparing Ve&s;&s;els for the Lord's U&s;e; and he broke us down by his Judg|ments from following flattering Fle&s;h, and the plea&s;ing Vanities of the World, and the &s;ubtle Baits of Satan, by the Tenders of his Love, and engaged us to follow the heavenly and inward Calls, Knocks, and Reproofs of his holy Spirit, and to obey the Dictates of the &s;ame.

<P>We al&s;o had a very large Meeting on this I&s;land in an Orchard, where I had good Service for the Lord; and I remember I was much concern'd a|bout the two Mini&s;trations, <HI>viz, John</HI>'s Bapti&s;m with <HI>Water,</HI> and CHRIST'S with the <HI>holy Gho&s;t,</HI> it being clear from <HI>John</HI>'s Words, that he &s;aw to the End of his own Di&s;pen&s;ation when he declared, <HI>he mu&s;t de|crea&s;e, but</HI> CHRIST <HI>mu&s;t increa&s;e;</HI> which is generally under&s;tood to re&s;pect their differing Di&s;pen&s;ations; for the fir&s;t Bapti&s;m was to baptize <HI>unto Repentance,</HI> the other to <HI>the purging of the Floor,</HI> and <HI>burning up of that which was combu&s;tible,</HI> viz. the Chaff and Stubble, which the Lord's Bapti&s;m burneth up in|wardly, and which no elementary Thing can do; for if all the Eatings, Wa&s;hings, Ob&s;ervations and Cere|monies under the Law, although to <HI>I&s;rael</HI> command|ed and enjoined by the Lord, could not make the Comers thereunto <HI>perfect,</HI> how &s;hould the&s;e or any of them now, when not commanded, as they ne|ver were to us, <HI>perfect</HI> the <HI>Gentile</HI> World?

with, and &s;hewed the Beginning, U&s;e and End of the watery Di&s;pen&s;ation, and the U&s;e and Continu|ance of CHRIST'S &s;piritual Bapti&s;m to the End of the World.

<P>The Ma&s;ter was willing, at our Reque&s;t, to land three of us, <HI>(i.e.)</HI> me, my Companion, and <HI>Su&s;annah Freeborn,</HI> a publick Friend, who had a Concern upon her Mind for &s;ome Time, (as &s;he &s;ignified to Friends in <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> where &s;he lived) to vi&s;it the few Friends in <HI>Nantucket,</HI> and Friends thought this a proper Sea&s;on to pay that Vi&s;it.

<P>We then enquired for <HI>Nathaniel Starbuck,</HI> who we under&s;tood was in &s;ome degree convinced of the Truth, and having Directions to his Hou&s;e, we went thither, and I told him, <HI>We made bold to come to his Hou&s;e and if he was free to receive us, we would &s;tay a little with him, but if not, we would go el&s;ewhere; for we heard he was a &s;eeking religious Man, and &s;uch chiefly we were come to vi&s;it:</HI> He &s;aid, <HI>we were very welcome.</HI> And by this Time came in his Mother <HI>Mary Starbuck,</HI> who the I&s;landers e&s;teemed as a Judge a|mong them, for little of Moment was done there without her, as I under&s;tood.</P>

Meeting was mo&s;tly gathered. I was under a very great Load in my Spirit, but the Occa&s;ion of it was hid from me, but I &s;aw it my place to go to Meet|ing, the Order of which was &s;uch, in all the Parts thereof. I had not &s;een the like before; the large and bright rubbed Room was &s;et with &s;uitable Seats or Chairs, the Gla&s;s Windows token out of the Frames, and many Chairs placed without very con|veniently, &s;o that I did not &s;ee any thing wanting, according to the Place, but &s;omething to &s;tand on, for I was not free to &s;et my Feet upon the &s;ine Cane Chair, le&s;t I &s;hould break it.</P>
<P>I am the more particular in this exact and exem|plary Order than in &s;ome other Things, for the Seats both within and without Doors were &s;o placed, that the Faces of the People were towards the Seats where the publick Friends &s;at, and when &s;o &s;et, they did not look or gaze in our Faces, as &s;ome I think are too apt to do, which in my Thoughts be&s;peaks an unconcerned Mind: The Meeting being thus gathered and &s;et down in this orderly and ample Manner, (although there were but very few bearing our Name in it) it was not long before the mighty Power of the Lord began to work, and in it my Com|panion e&s;pecially did appear in Te&s;timony in the fore Part thereof; and while he was &s;peaking, a Prie&s;t (not him before touched or, but another) flung out &s;ome Reflections upon him, and the People for his Sake, which I did not &s;ee the lea&s;t Occa&s;ion for; af|ter which he went away, (but more of this in the Sequel.)</P>
<P>I &s;at a con&s;iderable Time in the Meeting before

I could &s;ee my Way clear to &s;ay any thing, until the Lord's heavenly Power rai&s;ed me, and &s;et me upon my Feet as if one had lifted me up, and what I had fir&s;t in commi&s;&s;ion to &s;peak, was in the Words of Chri&s;t to <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> viz. <HI>Except a Man be born a|gain, he cannot &s;ee the Kingdom of God;</HI> with the&s;e Words, <HI>Nay, the natural and unregenerate Man can|not &s;o much as &s;ee the heavenly and &s;piritual Kingdom of Chri&s;t, which &s;tands not only in Power, but al&s;o in Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Joy and Peace in the holy Spirit; and to be born again, was not to be done unperceivable, no more then the natural Birth could be brought forth with|out Trouble; and to pretend to be in Chri&s;t and not to be new Creatures, is prepo&s;terous; and to pretend to be new Creatures, and yet not able to render any Account how it was performed, was unrea&s;onable; for it could not be,</HI> as I urged before, <HI>without our Knowledge; for to be born again, &s;ignified to be quickened and rai&s;ed into a &s;piritual and new Life, by which the Body of the Sins of the Fle&s;h is mortified, and we come to live a &s;elf-denying Life: Tho&s;e who are crucified with Chri&s;t, they are crucified to their Sins, that as he died for Sin, we might die to Sin: In this State we live not after the Fle&s;h although we live</HI> as the Apo&s;tle &s;aid) in the Fle&s;h; but the Life which the&s;e (live, is through Faith in the Son of God; And to have all this, and much more wrought in us, and we know nothing <HI>of it, it unac|countable.</HI></P>
<P>As I was thus opened, and delivering the&s;e Things, with much more than I can remember, the great Woman I felt, for mo&s;t of an Hour together, fought and &s;trove again&s;t the Te&s;timony, &s;ometimes look|ing

<P>This worthy Man, and Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, notwith&s;tanding his great Endowments and excellent Qualifications, yet thought it his place to &s;toop to and give way to the Truth, and let the holy Te&s;ti|mony go through whom it might plea&s;e the Lord to impower and employ in his Work, although it might be through contemptible In&s;truments.

<P>The Country was much alarmed; for, as Friends &s;aid, <HI>George Keith</HI> had given Notice two Weeks be|fore-hand, that he intended to be at this Monthly-meeting,
<PB N="97" REF="008308_0351_102E8A6021F0D3D8">
and the People were in great Expectation to hear the <HI>Quakers</HI> run down, for <HI>George Keith</HI> had boa&s;ted much of what he would prove again&s;t Friends. So after &s;ome Pau&s;e, Retirment and fer|vent Seeking to the Lord for Direction and Coun&s;el in this important Affair, I went to the Rails, and leaned my Arms on them near <HI>George Keith's</HI> Hor&s;e's Head, as he &s;at on his Back, and many People were with him; but the few Friends who were come &s;tood with me in the Yard. My fervent Prayers were to the Lord, that it he gave me any thing to &s;peak to <HI>George,</HI> it might go forth in that Power and Wi&s;dom which was able to wound that wicked Spi|rit in which he appear'd, and boa&s;ted over Friends after the following Manner, crying, <HI>Is here a Man that is a Scholar? Is here a Man that under&s;tands the Languages among&s;t you? If &s;o I will di&s;pute with him.</HI> I told him, <HI>It was probable that the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Tongue was mo&s;t under&s;tood and u&s;ed among&s;t that People, and therefore I thought it was the be&s;t to keep to it.</HI> He went on and &s;aid, <HI>that he was come in the Queen's Name to gather the</HI> Quakers <HI>from</HI> Quakeri&s;m, <HI>to the Mother Church, the good old Church of</HI> England, and that <HI>he intended to exhibit in our Meeting on the Mor|row the&s;e Charges following again&s;t us, which,</HI> he &s;aid, <HI>he could prove we were guilty of, out of our Friends Books,</HI> viz. Errors, Here&s;ies, damnable Doctrines <HI>and</HI> Bla&s;phemies: <HI>Look</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>to an&s;wer for your|&s;elves&punc; for if you do not, the Auditory will conclude, that what I exhibit again&s;t you is true.</HI></P>
<P>I was rou&s;ed up in my Spirit in a holy Zeal a|gain&s;t his wicked In&s;ults and great Threatnings,

and &s;aid to him, <HI>That it was the Fruit of Malice and Envy,</HI> and <HI>that he was to us but as an</HI> heathen Man <HI>and</HI> Publican; (but more of this anon.) Then he began to ca&s;t what Slurs and Odiums he could upon Friends, with &s;uch bitter Invectives as his Ma|lice could invent. I &s;tood with an attentive Ear and a watchful Mind; for as I &s;tood leaning upon the Rails, with no &s;mall Concern upon my Mind, I felt the Lord's Power ari&s;e, and by it my Strength was renewed in the inner Man, and Faith, Wi&s;dom and Courage with it, &s;o that the Fear of Man, with all his Parts and Learning, was taken from me; and in this State <HI>George Keith</HI> appeared to me but as a <HI>little Child,</HI> or as <HI>nothing:</HI> Renowned be the mo&s;t excellent Name of the Lord, now and for ever. But this great Champion (<HI>Goliah</HI> like, at lea&s;t in his Mind) I &s;uppo&s;ed fear'd not any there; he overlook|ed us all, and in the Pride of his Heart di&s;dained us; but the Lord of Heaven and Earth looked down up|on us in a very acceptable Time, and helped us for his Name's &s;ake, and covered our Heads in the Day of Battle: Glorified be his great Name for ever.</P>
<P>I have &s;ometimes thought to omit &s;ome Part of this Account concerning <HI>George Keith,</HI> but I remem|ber it opened very clearly in my Mind then, and I &s;aid to him, <HI>That the Hand of the Lord was again&s;t him, and that he would pour forth Contempt upon him, for his Di&s;obedience and Wickedne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to his Reflections; he &s;aid, <HI>the</HI> Qua|kers <HI>pretend to be again&s;t all Ceremonies, but he could prove that they u&s;ed many Ceremonies, as</HI> taking one another by the Hand, <HI>and</HI> Men &s;aluting one another,

<HI>and</HI> Women doing &s;o to one another, <HI>and,</HI> he &s;aid, <HI>that Women did</HI> &s;alute Men; <HI>yea, they had done it to him;</HI> as it was generally under&s;tood by tho&s;e who heard him, which I thought not worthy my Notice, (but more of this anon.) He went on and &s;aid, <HI>the</HI> Quakers <HI>pretended, to be again&s;t all Per&s;ecution but they were not clear, for the</HI> Quakers <HI>in</HI> Penn&s;ylvania <HI>and the</HI> Jer&s;eys <HI>had per&s;ecuted him, and would have hang'd him, but that there was &s;ome Alteration in the Government.</HI></P>
<P>Then came out one of my Arrows which cut and wounded him deep: I &s;aid, George, <HI>that is not true.</HI> Upon that the Prie&s;t drew near and appeared very bri&s;k, and &s;aid, <HI>I had as good as charged Mr.</HI> Keith (as he called him) <HI>with a Lye.</HI> I replied, <HI>Give me Time, and I will prove that which</HI> George <HI>&s;aid, was</HI> not true, <HI>and then thou and he may &s;ake your Advan|tage to re&s;cue him from that Epithet of a Lyar if you can.</HI> The Prie&s;t &s;aid, <HI>I knew not Mr.</HI> Keith: I replied, <HI>If he knew him as well as I did, he would be a&s;ham'd to be there as an Abettor of him.</HI> The Prie&s;t got away, and troubled me no more in all the Engagements that <HI>George</HI> and I had afterwards (altho' the &s;aid Prie&s;t was with him.) Then I demanded of <HI>George, What Way our Freinds proceeded again&s;t him, and what Mea&s;ures they took, as he would in&s;inuate, to bring him to the Gallows?</HI> But I perceived Fear be|gan to &s;urprize the <HI>Hyprocrite,</HI> and he thinking by my Boldne&s;s I was an Inhabitant in tho&s;e Parts, and knew his Abu&s;e to Friends in the&s;e Provinces, and their peaceable Behaviour towards him, was wil|ling to let the Matter drop, and demanded <HI>my Name,</HI>

which was told him. I then a&s;ked, <HI>How he could have a Face to urge &s;uch a notorious Untruth in the View of that People who were much Stranger's to, and ignorant of the Troubles and Differences, chiefly created by him, among Friends in tho&s;e Parts?</HI></P>
<P>This Meeting (as before mentioned) being ge|nerally newly convinced of the Truth, therefore I urged to have him come to the Particulars of Friends Proceedings again&s;t him, that even for very Shame, among tho&s;e Strangers he would &s;et forth as far as he could in Truth, the Steps Friends had taken in per&s;ecuting him, as he pretended; but he would not meddle in the lea&s;t with it.

and they told me what it was, but not Writing it down, it went from me) and accordingly &s;he came to the Meeting, where the Lord's mighty Power broke in upon us, to the tendring of many Hearts, to Friends mutual Satisfaction, and it proved a good Day to the afore&s;aid young Woman; her Heart was as if it had melted within her, and &s;he &s;hed many Tears, and I am Satisfied went from the Meeting in Fear and in great Joy; in <HI>Fear,</HI> how to walk as not to offend Chri&s;t the <HI>Elect,</HI> which before &s;he could talk of, but now &s;he had met with, and he had opened her State to her: And <HI>Joy,</HI> that &s;he had met with the Me&s;&s;iah, the <HI>Elect of the Father,</HI> his choice and beloved Son; &s;o that &s;he could now &s;ay, <HI>Where are the Wi&s;e? Where is the Scribe? Where is the Di&s;puter of this World?</HI> All her bri&s;k talkative Qualities were &s;wallowed up in the feeling of the internal, enlightning Pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>When &s;he returned to her Ma&s;ter's (before men|tioned) he a&s;ked her, <HI>If &s;he had got Satisfaction?</HI> meaning, Had &s;he had any Di&s;cour&s;e with me and was &s;atisfied? She replied, <HI>She &s;atisfied.</HI> Some Time after I met with her in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> plain and Truth-like, but knew not who &s;he was at the fir&s;t. The Manner of the Working of the Truth is to humble the Creature, and bring it into Con|trition. Tenderne&s;s, and Fear, with true Self-denial.</P>
<P>I come now to mention &s;omething that happened in my going over <HI>James's River,</HI> towards a Yearly-meeting in <HI>Virginia:</HI> Alighting at an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> by the River-&s;ide, where we refre&s;hed our&s;elves there was a poor little Child cried &s;o exceedingly, that I was
<PB N="139" REF="008308_0393_102E8AD159C7E638">
unea&s;y to hear it, and a&s;ked the Mother, what was the matter? She &s;aid, it had cried mo&s;t of the Time &s;ince it was born, and they were almo&s;t off their Feet with it, or to that effect. I told her, I believ|ed I could give the Child &s;omething which would do good, and &s;he readily agreed to it, and I gave it a little of &s;omething then, and order'd her to give it twice more in four or five Days time: But when I returned, the Child was better, and oh! how glad the poor Woman was to &s;ee me, and &s;poke more in my Commendations than was to my Satisfaction, and was kind to Friends afterward for my Sake.</P>
<P>Now we came to ferry over the River, being, as I remember, five Hor&s;es and nine People; there was <HI>Jane Plea&s;ant</HI> a publick Friend, and her Man|&s;ervant who rid before her upon a great Hor&s;e, and high in Fle&s;h, and about the Mid&s;t of the River, it being two Miles over, he ro&s;e upon his hind Feet, and &s;lung him&s;elf upon the Edge or Gunnel of the Boat, half into the River; the Fall of the Hor&s;e, and the Motion of the other Hor&s;es thereupon, cau&s;|ed the Boat to make &s;uch Sallies that it took in Water, and was very likely to &s;ink: But before he could have Time to ri&s;e again, or to make any more Springs, I took &s;everal young Men by the Shoul|ders, and flung them upon his Neck to keep him down, and told them as fa&s;t as I could, why I did &s;o. Now I had to deal with the Ferry-man, who was about to &s;trip for &s;wimming, and &s;aid <HI>we &s;hould all he drowned; but for his Part he could &s;wim;</HI> and was about to leap into the River, <HI>for,</HI> he &s;aid, <HI>the Boat would either break or &s;ink.</HI> I told him. <HI>It will
<PB N="140" REF="008308_0394_102E8B939A40DB10">
&s;oon enough for him to &s;wim, when he &s;aw the Boat either break or &s;ink, and it he would not row, then I would;</HI> With much Intreaty he took the Oar again and rowed us to the Shore. But in our imminent Danger I looked over my tender Friends, (for &s;o they appeared to me) and thought in my Heart what a Pity it would be, it all the&s;e were drowned! yet the Thought of my own drowning never en|ter'd my Mind, until I was got over the River, which was a Mercy to me, and a great Means to keep out Di&s;order and Confu&s;ion, which commonly attend &s;udden Surprises and Frights, or el&s;e they make People dead-hearted and almo&s;t &s;en&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>As I had now an Occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, as well as in &s;ome imminent Dangers I had &s;een before, where I happened to be, I find it an excellent Thing to be as much as we can, always ready, and by being frequently thinking upon Death, it is not &s;o &s;urpriz|ing when it does come: This is a great Point of true Wi&s;dom, <HI>to number our Days &s;o, as to remember our latter End.</HI> The want of thus contemplating and truly thinking on what Preparation we are in to look Death in the Face, and to appear before the great Judge of both Quick and Dead, was the Cau&s;e of the Complaint, <HI>Oh! that my People were wi&s;e that they under&s;tood this, that they would con&s;ider their lat|ter End.</HI> The great Remi&s;ne&s;s of &s;uch Con&s;idera|tions among People, be&s;peaks Folly and great In&s;en|&s;ibility, and that the Heart is hardened through an Habit of &s;inning; oh! that I might prevail with the Children of Men to awake. Ari&s;e, you that &s;leep in Sin, and are at ea&s;e therein, that you may come

to hear inwardly the Call of the Son of God, that your Souls may not only live here to &s;erve God, but al&s;o may live eternally in Bli&s;s with him is the De|&s;ire of my Soul for the whole Bulk of Mankind; for my Life has often appear'd not dear to me, in Com|pari&s;on of the &s;aving of the Souls of the Children of Men.</P>
<P>I have often thought of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> how far he went for &s;aving of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and how far <HI>Paul</HI> went for the &s;aving of his Kinsfolk after the Fle&s;h; it was a great Demon&s;tration, that the&s;e great and good Men had great Faith and Intere&s;t in the Lord, and al&s;o a very great Love to his People; and &s;uch who&s;e Eyes are truly opened, cannot but &s;ee it is the Love of God, and Love to the Souls of Men, that con&s;trains us thus to take our Lives as in our Hands, and labour under many weary Steps, and many Perils by Sea and by Land, and in the Wilderne&s;s, Cold, and &s;ometimes in Tumults and Noi&s;es, &s;ometimes in Watchings and Fa&s;tings, that we have been &s;ome|times Spectacles to Men; but the Lord hath given us Faith and Patience to bear and overcome all, as we have &s;ingly &s;tood in his heavenly Coun&s;el, and been truly devoted to his Will in all Things.</P>
<P>It may not be ami&s;s to mention a particular thing which happened to me before I left <HI>Long-I&s;land,</HI> viz. Knowing that my Landlady, <HI>Samuel Bowne's</HI> Wife, had a very &s;ore Brea&s;t, by which &s;he had much Trouble, and had no le&s;s than five Tents in it, and &s;he being a &s;en&s;ible and a &s;erviceable Woman, &s;ome|thing came with a Concern upon my Mind to ad|mini&s;ter unto her Brea&s;t, with a Belief <HI>it would heal
<PB N="142" REF="008308_0396_102E78D6D708BA80">
her:</HI> I rea&s;on'd about it until I had got one Foot into the Stirrup for mounting my Hor&s;e, but I grew unea&s;y for being dilatory in doing that which came into my Mind; &s;o I went in again and &s;aid, <HI>Mary, I am come back to advi&s;e thee what thou &s;hould&s;t do, by which, I believe</HI> thou wilt be healed, <HI>although I can|not &s;tay to &s;ee it done. I believe,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>and intend to follow thy Advice;</HI> but a&s;ked, <HI>what would become of all tho&s;e Tents?</HI> I told her, <HI>the Poultice would draw them all out, and give her Ea&s;e;</HI> and accordingly I heard it did, for &s;he &s;lept twelve Hours immediately after the Time of the Application, and when &s;he awoke the Tents were all drawn out, and &s;he had little further Trouble with it: So it is good to mind Truth and the Workings of it in all Things. I met with the great Doctor (as he was e&s;teemed) who had it under hand, and he &s;aid <HI>I was a bold Fellow:</HI> I &s;aid, <HI>it proved well.</HI> He An&s;wered, <HI>it was well for me it did.</HI></P>
<P>Something more which I have before omitted oc|curs to my Memory: When I was in that Part of <HI>Virginia</HI> towards <HI>North-Carolina,</HI> to vi&s;it Friends, a very great Mi&s;t aro&s;e, and we went wrong, until the Guides were &s;o far lo&s;t, that they confe&s;t, they knew not Ea&s;t from We&s;t nor on which Hand we had left the Road, although it was in the fore Part of the Day, but neither Wind or Sun to be felt or &s;een; then I told them, <HI>I would try what I could do, if they did but know what Quarter we &s;hould go to:</HI> They &s;aid, <HI>we &s;hould go towards the South;</HI> then I brought out my little Compa&s;s which I had made before I left <HI>England,</HI> and took it in my Hand and

&s;teer'd by it, till we all came into the Road; for that inward Sen&s;e I had, did per&s;uade me, that we were to the We&s;tward of the Road, &s;o leaning a little to the Ea&s;tward of the South Point, we came right as before, and when &s;o, the Guides much re|joiced, and &s;aid, <HI>I was fitter to be Guide in a Wil|derne&s;s Country than they.</HI> My Compa&s;s was not &s;o big as a <HI>Tailor's</HI> Thimble, which had often been of U&s;e to me, and others with me.</P>
<P>Now the Time came on for my leaving all my near and dear Friends in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e Parts, and I embark'd for the I&s;lands the Sixth of the <HI>Ninth Month</HI> 1702, with my Companion <HI>James Bates,</HI> on board of a Sloop, <HI>Samuel Salter</HI> Ma&s;ter, for <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and we put into <HI>Bermudas</HI> in our way: Soon after we land|ed, being on the 21&s;t of the &s;ame Month, we were &s;ent for by Governor <HI>Bennett</HI> to come before him, and being near his Door, a Man came and clapt me on the Shoulder, as we were walking on our way, and &s;aid roughly to us, <HI>You mu&s;t go before the Gover|nor,</HI> and &s;eem'd to ha&s;ten us: I replied meekly, <HI>I am willing to go as fa&s;t as I can, but I have been very Sea-&s;ick, and can go but weakly:</HI> The man fell from his Roughne&s;s, and bid us take Time, and carried him&s;elf very civily to us, and put us by a Man who was keeping Centry at the Governor's Door with his Mu&s;ket on his Arm, and when we were come into a large Room the Man left us, and we &s;taying a while, I began to rea&s;on in my&s;elf, <HI>What if the Governor &s;hould be a rigid Man and be &s;evere to us, and either confine or puni&s;h us?</HI> But I &s;aid in my Heart, <HI>Lord, thou that knowe&s;t all Things, knowe&s;t

that I have not only offered up my Liberty, but Life al&s;o, for thy Name and Go&s;pel's &s;ake;</HI> and immedi|ately the Fear and Rea&s;onings about human Power was taken away from me.</P>
<P>I being not well, and weary with walking from the Ship, &s;at down to re&s;t my&s;elf unbidden, when there came a friendly well carriaged young Woman, who I &s;uppo&s;ed to be a Servant, and &s;poke kindly to us; I de&s;ired her to do as much for us as to give us &s;omething that was &s;mall to drink, for we were very thir&s;ty and had been much out of Health, and were not well recovered &s;ince we came from the Sea, having had rough Weather: She brought us Wine and Water, and a Thing to mix them in; &s;o tak|ing mo&s;t of a Gla&s;s of Water, and a very little Wine poured into it, I drank and was very well refre&s;hed. By this Time &s;he Governor called us into an upper Room, and as I came near to the Top of the Stairs, going but faintly, for Rea&s;ons before given, the Go|vernor put forth his Hand and reached to take hold of mine, and like a tender Father drew me up, and led me along towards a great Window, and &s;tood and looked on me and &s;aid, <HI>He believed he knew what I was, and my Bu&s;ine&s;s too,</HI> I reply'd, <HI>it might be &s;o,</HI> and a&s;ked, <HI>if he was the Governor of that Place?</HI> He &s;aid <HI>he was,</HI> and bowed his Head.

I endeavoured to per&s;uade him to let us go without troubling him&s;elf any further, for I was &s;en&s;ible of his good Will and Love to us, and having his Countenance, was more than we expected, and as much as we de&s;ir'd.

<P>Now as the Judge was &s;omewhat troubled with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, I found his u&s;ual Bed-time drew near, and I made an Offer to go away l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ft I &s;hould di&s;|commode him, yet he appeared unwilling to part with us, but con&s;idering his own Ailments and our early Ri&s;ing in the Morning, he at length con&s;ented: But before we parted, his Wife a&s;ked leave of him to go with us on the Morrow to the Meeting, to

which he readily a&s;&s;ented, if he was not wor&s;e of his Di&s;temper, and then ordered how we &s;hould ride, and which Negro &s;hould go, not only to help his Wife but us al&s;o, and take our Hor&s;es when there was Occa&s;ion, and do any thing he could for us; and indeed &s;o he did, and appeared to me to run on his Feet without much Trouble, being a lively young Man.</P>
<P>I omitted before, that the Judge a&s;ked, <HI>If we had &s;een the Governor,</HI> and <HI>if he was kind to us?</HI> I told him he was very friendly to us, and &s;aid, <HI>If we met with any Trouble in his Liberty that he could help us in, only let him know and he would right us.</HI> The Judge &s;aid, <HI>It was very well, and he was glad of it.</HI> I per|ceived the Judge was rather a Moderator of the Governor, he being an ancient wi&s;e Man, and had lived long as a Judge upon the I&s;land, and under|&s;tood (it is like) more fully the State of Things there than the Governor could be capable of, he being but a young Man, altho' he appeared to be a wi&s;e Man, and, as <HI>William Penn</HI> &s;aid, came of an ancient and honourable Family in <HI>England.</HI> which he knew very well, who&s;e Name was <HI>Bennett.</HI> Af|terwards I told <HI>William Penn</HI> how it had fared with us on that I&s;land, and e&s;pecially the Kindne&s;s of the two chief Men in Power there, and <HI>William Penn</HI> wept, and &s;aid, <HI>He had not heard any Account of this Nature, that he had been &s;o much affected with, as he remembred the&s;e many Years.</HI></P>
<P>Now we left the Judge until the Morning, and got &s;ome &s;mall Refre&s;hment, it being late, and I had been faint for &s;everal Hours for want of eating,

but the Lord's heavenly Power bore me up over all, &s;o that at Times I felt no want of any thing; Oh! Renowned over all be the Name of the mighty God, now and for ever. We went to Bed, and when Morning came, I with my Companion were &s;tirring early, having eight Miles to the Meeting, and it being in the latter End of the Ninth Month, we were willing to be in &s;uch Time, that we might give &s;ome Notice to the People. I was walking in our Lodging Room early, and the Judge's Wife came to the Door and a&s;ked, <HI>if &s;he might &s;peak with us?</HI> I &s;aid <HI>&s;he might;</HI> then &s;he came in and &s;aid, <HI>She had a Me&s;&s;age from her Hu&s;band to us;</HI> I queried, <HI>what it was?</HI> She &s;aid, <HI>He de&s;ired we would come and pray for him before we went away.</HI> I de&s;ired &s;he would favour us &s;o much as to lay before her Hu&s;|band &s;omething which I had to &s;ay, and &s;he pro|mi&s;ed &s;he would: <HI>Well then, tell the Judge, that if he will &s;uffer us to come into his Room, and &s;it down and wait upon the Lord, as our Manner is in &s;uch a Ca&s;e as this, if it plea&s;e the Lord to move us by his holy Spirit to pray we may; but if not, let not the Judge take it ami&s;s, for we are willing to be at the Lord's di&s;po&s;ing in all Things.</HI> She went, and I believe, as &s;he &s;aid, laid the Matter before him as I had de|liver'd it to her; for &s;he was a Woman of a good Under&s;tanding, and came back again to us in a very little Time: I a&s;ked, <HI>what the Judge &s;aid?</HI> She re|plied, he &s;aid, <HI>Let the Men take their own Way, and whether they pray for me or not, I believe they are Men of God:</HI> So after &s;ome little re&s;pite, we being brought to the Judge's Bed-&s;ide, &s;at down and

waited upon the Lord, who was plea&s;ed in his Love and by his mighty Power to break in upon us, and al&s;o opened my Mouth in his Gift of Grace and of Supplication, in which Gift, ardent and fervent. Cries went up to the Lord of Heaven and Earth, that he would &s;end Health and Salvation to the Judge, and al&s;o to all his Family, and to all People far and near, that all every where might repent, and come to the Knowledge of he Truth and be &s;aved. The Judge wept aloud, and a mighty Vi&s;i|tation it was to his Family, and e&s;pecially to him|&s;elf and his tender Wife. We left the Judge in a fine Frame of Spirit, and no doubt near the King|dom, having his Ble&s;&s;ing and earne&s;t Reque&s;t, that when we could reach his Hou&s;e we would not fail to come to it, for we were very welcome; and I found and felt it &s;o, and it was mo&s;tly our Lodg|ings: His Wife and Foot-page went with us to all the Meetings, except one, while we were on the I&s;land, which was about two Weeks, in which Time we had many good Opportunities among a &s;ober be|haved and well carriaged People, among&s;t whom we met with, no Oppo&s;ition, but had large quiet Meetings.</P>
<P>When we were clear, as we thought, of the I&s;|land, we went to take our &s;olid Leaves of the Go|vernor, acknowledging his Civility and Genero&s;ity to us Strangers, and I told him and the Judge. <HI>That they would not leant their Reward for what they had done to us, and &s;uch who &s;hould take their Lives as in their Hands, and come in the Love of God to vi&s;it the&s;e remote Parts of the World, which we dur&s;t

<P>Being invited to a Friend's Hou&s;e to dine one Day, when we were &s;at down at the Table, the Woman of the Hou&s;e de&s;ired <HI>that one of us would &s;ay Grace;</HI> from which I took an Occa&s;ion to &s;hew her, and &s;everal more in the Company, who appear'd not much more grown in the Truth than &s;he, <HI>that &s;ince we had been a People, we had both believed</HI> (and ac|cordingly practis'd) <HI>that</HI> true Prayer <HI>was not perform|ed without the</HI> Help of the holy Spirit of God, <HI>and no Man could pray</HI> aright <HI>and</HI> acceptably <HI>without it; nor was it in Man's Power to have it</HI> when he plea&s;|ed; <HI>therefore it is Man's Place to wait upon the Lord for the</HI> pouring forth of this Gift <HI>upon him, and al&s;o to know whether it</HI> be required of him to pray, <HI>&s;o as to be heard by Man, or only to pray</HI> &s;ecretly, <HI>&s;o as to be heard of God, as did</HI> Hannah, <HI>and many more have done; which, as they do aright, no doubt but as Chri&s;t &s;aid to his Di&s;ciples,</HI> their Father will hear them in &s;ecret, and reward them openly; or to this Effect: With which they all appeared &s;atisfied.</P>

<HI>with me, I was too great a Scholar for them.</HI> I &s;aid, there was little of Scholar&s;hip in it; I offered, I thought, nothing but plain Scripture and &s;ound Rea|&s;on; and I told them, I had now as good as an&s;wer|ed their Que&s;tion, and had given &s;everal Rea&s;ons to back my An&s;wer, and as they appeared wi&s;e, well read Men, and as far as I had gathered, had been principled again&s;t <HI>univer&s;al Salvation,</HI> and <HI>univer&s;al Grace,</HI> for them now to drop the Matter &s;o &s;lender|ly, before me who appear'd but like a Child to them, was very &s;urprizing: But they replied, <HI>they would not meddle with me.</HI></P>
<P>I then commended them for their good Temper, and the Civility they &s;hewed to me, for they were civil to me beyond what I could expect; and they invited me to the Burial of one of their decea&s;ed Friends, but I could not go, for I was in ha&s;te to get to <HI>Lincoln,</HI> having &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s there that ha|&s;tened me.

Furthermore I &s;aid, as I am a Stranger, and an excommunicated Per&s;on, and not of thy Children, the Apo&s;tles, if they wanted or were in any Straits for Nece&s;&s;aries, did not apply to Strangers for Help, but to &s;uch of their Children as they had been in&s;trumental in the Hand of God to plant the true Faith, and &s;ow the Seed of the King|dom in: Now the&s;e who were thus convinced, and by the Work of God's Power converted, the&s;e were &s;uch who knew Spiritual Things &s;own in them, who I believed were very free to di&s;tribute (where true Need was) of their temporal Things, e&s;pecially to &s;uch who had been in&s;trumental in the Lord's Hand to their coming to the &s;aving Knowledge of Je&s;us

<P>I may add one Ob&s;ervation or two not mentioned in our Debate, which were, that <HI>If the Maintenance of the Prie&s;ts was to be wholly withdrawn, or left to thy Freedom and Genero&s;ity of the People, many of them would want and come to Poverty, and he forced to la|bour with their Hands, which would di&s;tract or at lea&s;t impede their Studies.</HI> I an&s;wer'd, that with &s;uch Mini&s;ters as they were, <HI>this might be the Ca&s;e:</HI> But if all Would come truly and rightly to wait on the great Teacher, the Anointing in them&s;elves, it would greatly tend to the Advantage of <HI>Chri&s;tendom;</HI> for the Almighty, who by his good Spirit is alone able to rai&s;e up and quality Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters, as he knows the Wants of his People, and their Faith and Tru&s;t in him, would no doubt rai&s;e up from among them faithful Mini&s;ters; &s;uch, who being humble, meek and low in Heart, like him of whom they had learned, would be content to live in Modera|tion

on a little, and to labour in their re&s;pective Callings, like the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> that great Mini&s;ter of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> working with their Hands that their Mini&s;try might not be chargeable, &s;uch as <HI>Fi&s;her|men, Collectors of Cu&s;toms,</HI> &amp;c. who&s;e Mini&s;try being not their own, but received immediately from the great Shepherd of the Sheep, would not require much Time and Study to pen down, but coming from the Spirit of Truth immediately moving upon the Mini&s;ter's Heart, would be more effectual to reach the Witne&s;s of Truth in the Hearts of their Hearers than all the laboured Di&s;cour&s;es of the mo&s;t &s;ubtil Prie&s;t, though the Produce of much Pains and Study.

<P>We parted very friendly, and Friends were glad of the Opportunity, he having the Character of being a great Scholar and a wi&s;e Man; but from all that pa&s;&s;ed, they believed he gained no Advan|tage: However he behaved well; and before we parted, I told him, I thought the greate&s;t Rea&s;on why &s;ome think us refined was this, That formerly People were to prejudiced, that whatever was printed or &s;aid again&s;t us, our Principles, Practice and Doc|trine, was generally received and believed, though never &s;o much di&s;gu&s;ted or covered with &s;uch Dre&s;&s;es as might render us mo&s;t odious, and were by many taken for the Standard of our Belief and Practice; but of late the Light hath mere appeared, and many are grown better di&s;po&s;ed towards us, and likewi&s;e Men, not willing to be impo&s;ed upon any longer, have &s;earched for them&s;elves into the State of the Controver&s;y between us and our oppo&s;ers; and our Writings upon peru&s;al, appearing &s;o clear and dif|ferent from what the Books of tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed us charged upon us, cau&s;ed many who read them with a good De&s;ign, and were willing to be &s;et right, to &s;ay <HI>we were reformed, and not the People that we had been.</HI> The Prie&s;t &s;aid, <HI>he thought there might be much owing to that:</HI> I told him it was undeniable, that

there mu&s;t be a great Difference between our Prin|ciples, Doctrines and Conver&s;ations, truly &s;tated and &s;et forth in their proper Light, and when they were mi&s;repre&s;ented, &s;ometimes with all the Art and im|placable Malice that Men were capable of: And this has been the Way our Adver&s;aries have treated us, almo&s;t in every Thing we have believed, &s;aid of writ, although it was very agreeable to the holy Scriptures of the Old and New Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>We returned back to <HI>Salem, Lynn</HI> and <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and vi&s;ited Friends in our Way, and at <HI>Rhode-I&s;land, Long-I&s;land</HI> and <HI>New-York;</HI> and we had many good Meetings and &s;ome large in the <HI>Jer&s;eys,</HI> where I had &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e with a Ju&s;tice of the Peace about <HI>Water-Bapti&s;m,</HI> but he did not hold it long before he gave up; and I had another at <HI>Allens-Town</HI> with a <HI>Pre&s;byterian,</HI> which held for &s;ome Hours, about <HI>Water-Bapti&s;m,</HI> and concerning <HI>Election</HI> and <HI>Repro|bation,</HI> and he al&s;o &s;oon give up as to the fir&s;t; but when he began about <HI>Election</HI> and <HI>Reprobation,</HI> I &s;aid, I thought it was the mo&s;t pernicious Doctrine that ever was broach'd in the World, it did &s;o oppo&s;e the very Nature of God, and his De&s;ign of creating of Man, which, with all his other Works, he pro|nounced good and ble&s;&s;ed; and that Man, as the Crown and Glory of all his Works which he had created, &s;hould be de&s;igned for the mo&s;t mi&s;erable End, was unaccountable; I urged many Scriptures again&s;t that Doctrine, as al&s;o the Confu&s;ion their were in about it, as that of their <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> Con|fe&s;&s;ion of Faith, wherein they &s;ay, <HI>That the Decree is &s;o certain and definite, that one cannot be added to</HI>

I hope none will think that a Service to Mankind, to &s;trengthen or confirm that Decree if it were in their Power to do it, which I am &s;atisfied it is not; becau&s;e no &s;uch Decree was made or is in being; the oppo&s;ite appearing by plain Scripture (which he owned when I urged it) <HI>to wit,</HI> that the <HI>Fall</HI> of <HI>Adam</HI> did affect all; and upon the Parity of Rea&s;on, the <HI>Coming</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> did reach as far; becau&s;e, <HI>as in</HI> Adam <HI>all die, &s;o in Chri&s;t &s;hall all be made alive;</HI> he ta&s;ted Death <HI>for every Man,</HI> was a <HI>Propitiation for the Sins of all;</HI> and where then wilt thou find a People that is not included?

<P>From thence we went to <HI>Pen&s;ylvania,</HI> and had many good Meetings in that Part, and being clear and willing to return, I took leave of Friends in a

<P>A remarkable DELIVERANCE which happened to me, being omitted in its proper Place, I think &s;it to in&s;ert here, which was as follows.</P>
<P>In the Year 1718 and the <HI>Twelfth Month,</HI> when <HI>John Dodg&s;on</HI> was vi&s;iting Friends in our Parts, he lodged with me, and I went with him and his Bro|ther-in-Law <HI>Peter Buck,</HI> to be their Guide to <HI>Whithy,</HI> and &s;taid their Fir&s;t-day's Meeting; and Second-day's Preparative Meeting; and on the Third-day I went on with Friends towards <HI>Scarborough,</HI> to have the better Road home, there having fallen a great deal of Snow while we were at <HI>Whithy,</HI> &s;o that it was looked upon impracticable for me to return the &s;ame Way home that I came, it being a moori&s;h, bad Way: But in our Way back, within a Mile or little more from <HI>Scarborough,</HI> we came to a Brook, which by rea&s;on of the exce&s;&s;ive Rain and Snow
<PB N="218" REF="008308_0472_102E8B9FB98207D8">
was higher than ever I had &s;een it, &s;o that we came to ride thro' it, <HI>Henry Levin,</HI> our Guide, fir&s;t adven|tured in, being mounted upon a very &s;trong large Hor&s;e, and got over with &s;ome Difficulty, and I fol|lowed him; but when I came about the middle of the fording Place, it took my Mare off her Feet, and &s;omething being in the was, it turned her upon her Broad&s;ide, &s;o that I was di&s;mounted and carried away by the Rapidity of the Stream; but there being a Foot-bridge a little below, about Knee deep under Water, and no Rail either to be a Guide, or to lay a Hand on, and the Water being reduced to a nar|row Compa&s;s, hurried me violently along, and drove me with my Brea&s;t again&s;t the Bridge with &s;uch Force, that it very near knocked the Breath out of me; but before I touch'd the Bridge I happened to hold up my Hand, and <HI>John Dodg&s;on</HI> &s;eeing the Danger I was in, jumped off his Hor&s;e, and ran at a venture (&s;eeing the Water ripple) to hit the Bridge, and ju&s;t caught hold of my Fingers, and held my Head above Water, until <HI>Henry Levins,</HI> who was got over, came to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>But by the Strength of the Water in my Boot-tops, they being large, and by a Nail in the Tim|ber under the Bridge) catching hold of my great Coat, which held me fa&s;t, it was impo&s;&s;ible for one Man to free me, and not without &s;ome Difficulty for them both to get me out, the Nail holding &s;o fa&s;t that it tore out a great Piece of my Coat, Lining and all; but upon <HI>Henry's</HI> di&s;mounting, his Hor&s;e ran away to <HI>Scarborough,</HI> (and mine &s;wam back to the Company) and when they had got me out, <HI>Henry</HI> an on Foot to get his Hor&s;e, and found him at the
<PB N="219" REF="008308_0473_102E8BA19AA8FF38">
Stable Door where he u&s;ed to &s;tand, and in the mean Time <HI>John Dodg&s;on</HI> kept me in Motion by dragging me along, having very little or &s;ometimes no Hopes of my Recovery. When the Hor&s;e returned, they got me back to <HI>Scarborough,</HI> but I was not &s;en&s;ible how, and they had me to <HI>Dorothy Jaques's</HI> Hou&s;e, and when there, they could perceive my Lips move, but could not hear what I &s;aid, until one laid an Ear clo&s;e to my Mouth, and &s;o under&s;tood that I &s;aid, <HI>If they gave me any Thing that was &s;trong, it would carry me off;</HI> which made them very cautious: How|ever, they &s;tript me and changed my Shirt, and put me into a warm'd Bad, and applied warm Flannel to my Feet for three Hours together, which I knew nothing of, being then altogether Sen&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>I&s;aac Skelton,</HI> who had been a Companion of mine in the Service of the Truth, through &s;everal Coun|ties, hearing of this Accident, came immediately and got into Bed to me and kept me clo&s;e in his Bo&s;om, which many thought was a great Means to pre&s;erve my Life. <HI>John Dodg&s;on,</HI> though he in|tended for the Monthly-meetings expre&s;&s;ed &s;o great a Concern for me, that he &s;aid, <HI>He would either &s;ee me in a Way of Recovery, or die, before be le&s;t me;</HI> yet it plea&s;ed the Lord, of his infinite Mercy &s;o wonderfully to rai&s;e me up again, as to enable me to be at the Meeting next Day, and al&s;o to bear &s;ome Te&s;timony, which was very acceptable and com|fortable to Friends, as it was al&s;o to &s;ee me there beyond their Expectation; but yet I was much troubled with Pain, the fle&s;hy Part of my Shoulder

being rent by the violent hauling me out of the Water.</P>
<P>In Gratitude, my Soul can do no le&s;s than prai&s;e and magnify the Lord for this great Deliverance, and all his other Mercies, who alone is worthy. And I cannot but take Notice of Friends Kindne&s;s and Goodwill to me, in doing what&s;oever they could for me, but more e&s;pecially my worthy Friend <HI>John Dodg&s;on,</HI> who hazarded his Life to &s;ave mine.</P>
