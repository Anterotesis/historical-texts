When my Fear of Death left me, my Praying Frame al&s;o left me. I &s;eldome thought of getting an Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, but minded the World more than Real Re|ligion.

<Q><P>When I was between Twelve &amp; Thirteen years old, the Grace of God laid hold on me. It found me trifling, but it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uickly made me Stripes.

<P>By the Direction of my dear Ma&s;ter. Some of greater Maturity than I retired to Pray together, to help forward One anothers Salvation. Poor I was happily to the way but bu&s;y at my Sports.

Soon after, I overheard two or three Cen&s;uring me for my Indecent Athei&s;tic Carriage, and my Heart in|&s;tantly Smote me O &s;ee, how the Stratag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ms of Satan &s;ometimes thro' Grace become the means of Salvation! He de&s;igned it for Evil; but the Grace of God over-ruled it to my Everla&s;ting Welfare: Thus the Good Work began, and my Repentings were kindled together. My Heart burned within me! One of my Companions was &s;o faithful to me, as to Reprove me Seriou&s;ly, and Speak to me affectionately about another World: And the Spirit of God Set in with the kind Ad|monitions; Every Expre&s;&s;ion came with Power: Forthwith I re&s;olved to &s;et on the Great Work of Salvation. O &s;ee, my Soul, what God can do? <HI>Out of the Mouthes of Babes &amp; Sucklings He ordaineth Strength, to &s;till the Enemy and the Avenger.</HI></P>
<P>That which helped on the Good Work, was the Good Company I had. It plea&s;ed God at this very time, to work upon the Con&s;ciences of al|mo&s;t all our Cla&s;s; who had all a very great Concern upon us, for our own, and One anothers Souls, our Precious &amp; Immortal Souls. We had each others Examples &amp; Prayers to help on One another to Heaven &amp; Glory. O how Sweet was it, to talk with my Companions, of an Everla&s;ting State! How much was I affected with their Di&s;|cour&s;es! Thus we walked together as Brethren, Edifying One another, and drawing One another nearer &amp; nearer to God in a way of Duty Good Examples are good Guides to Heaven!</P></Q>
<P>I hope, there will be &s;ome Good Effect of the Pa&s;&s;age which I have thus tran&s;cribed, as well as of the whole Di&s;cour&s;e which it now belongs unto.</P>
