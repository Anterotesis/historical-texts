<SALUTE>Me&s;&s;rs. Gouverneur and Kemble, Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I had the honor on the 29th of la&s;t month to reque&s;t of your I&s;aac Gouverneur, on be|half of your hou&s;e as my agents, that the Hamburgh ve&s;&s;el the White Fox, Capt. Van Berend Edward Haber&s;trok, might not de|part till the in&s;urance to be made, pur&s;uant to the contract with Me&s;&s;rs. Gomez, Lopez, and Rivera, was entirely completed as we had agreed, nor before the requi&s;ite di&s;po&s;itions were made to &s;ecure the application of the proceeds of the cargo of cotton and indigo &s;old them on my account to the payment of what was due to me, having elected as I had a right to do, to receive the amount at one of the ports of di&s;charge. Towards this end, I reque&s;ted that my account with you might be prepared, in order to be adju&s;ted, and that I might be enabled by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the notes, or &s;ome competent authorization, and an authenticated copy of the contract of &s;ale, to receive the &s;um which was coming to me out of the proceeds of the cargo, and inform|ed him that it was my intention, thus pro|vided and enabled to go in per&s;on to Europe, to attend the progre&s;s of the affair and receive the payment to which I was entitled, that I had accordingly engaged a fa&s;t &s;ailing ve&s;&s;el to carry me, and that the nece&s;&s;ary arrange|ments being made, I &s;hould depart the third or fourth in&s;tant, to give my per&s;onal atten|tion to the cour&s;e of an affair of primary im|portance to me, and thereby perhaps prevent any di&s;a&s;trous con&s;equences which might otherwi&s;e ari&s;e. The&s;e de&s;ires, intentions and
<PB N="32" REF="034220_0032_0FFECAFCC39B33D8">
expectations were afterwards reiterated by me, but not being met as I could hope, I, on the 30th of May, wrote the letter of which a copy is herewith tran&s;mitted, and to which I received no an&s;wer. To my &s;urpri&s;e, I learnt the next day that the ve&s;&s;el had &s;ailed, and I am this moment ignorant that any ade|quate means have been attempted, to &s;e|cure the application of the proceeds of the cargo, according to the wi&s;h which I com|municated, and the right re&s;erved me by the contract, and I remain unfurni&s;hed with any documents or means by which I might take the mea&s;ures that might appear to me advi&s;able. Even the precaution which I urged of addre&s;&s;ing the hou&s;e of Le Con|teulx and Co. of Rouen, an authentica|ted copy of the contract of &s;ale, to the end that they might take care of my intere&s;t, was at that time refu&s;ed, and as far as I know has been omitted. To increa&s;e the inconveni|ence of my &s;ituation, I am left with the em|barra&s;&s;ment of having on my hands the ve&s;|&s;el I had hired to convey me to Europe, and may be expo&s;ed to lo&s;s from that &s;ource. In this &s;ituation I am &s;orry to be obliged to think that your hou&s;e has failed in ob&s;erving to|wards me a conduct corre&s;ponding with my rights and intere&s;t, and I conclude that it has made it&s;elf re&s;pon&s;ible for whatever lo&s;&s;es may en&s;ue. De&s;irous of obviating, however, as far as may &s;till be po&s;&s;ible, eventual misfortunes to any party, I offer my&s;elf to co-operate with you in concerting, without lo&s;s of time, &s;uch mea&s;ures as may &s;till be practicable to give ef|fect to the operation according to the true in|tent, and the rights of each party. To this end

we may avail our&s;elves of &s;uch legal or other advice, as the nature of the ca&s;e may render it u&s;eful.

<SALUTE>Louis LeGuen, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>We enclo&s;e you herewith, an account &s;ales of the goods that were placed in our hands, which render &pound;54,196 11 10 for their net proceeds. We al&s;o hand you a &s;tatement of our account current, and when we are in the receipt of all the money re&s;ulting from the &s;ales of the&s;e goods and the drawback of the duties, there will be coming to you a balance of &pound;47,544 15 6. We further &s;tate, there will be coming to us &pound;6256 2 6, to cover the pre&s;ent advances, &amp;c. be&s;ides which we are re&s;pon&s;ible for the charter of the &s;hip White Fox, in &pound;3733 6 8, on your account.
<PB N="34" REF="034220_0034_0FFECB016D7FE748">
Under the&s;e circum&s;tances we have grounded an objection to give you an authorization to receive the money in France for the &s;ales of the goods, until we are fir&s;t reimbur&s;ed and made &s;ecure. We have no objection to co|operate with you for the ultimate &s;ecurity of the property upon fair principles of ju&s;tice and equity. And if you have &s;eparated your &s;elf from us with a view to entangle or make us in any re&s;pect liable for the &s;ale to Me&s;&s;rs. Gomez, Lopez and Rivera, we tru&s;t you will find a di&s;appointment; &s;uch an idea is too ri|diculous to admit of a moment's &s;erious con|&s;ideration. In ju&s;tice to tho&s;e gentlemen, who have become the purcha&s;ers of the goods, we think proper to ob&s;erve, that they are men of property and fair characters, and that we are di&s;po&s;ed to treat them with a degree of delicacy throughout this unfortunate tran&s;ac|tion, which will evidently end in a con&s;idera|ble lo&s;s, and prove a gro&s;s deception by their not having a competent knowledge in the article of cotton, it would therefore be with reluctance that we &s;hould undertake any thing that might operate to their prejudice or inju|ry. Still we are not unwilling to devote our|&s;elves to your intere&s;t, nor do we &s;ee any rea|&s;on for all the difficulties and anxieties your imagination is apparently troubled with, with|out &s;u&s;taining any real cau&s;e of alarm.</P>

<SALUTE>Me&s;&s;rs. Gouverneur and Kemble, Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I received ye&s;terday your letter of the 6th in&s;t. with the accounts mentioned in it, which to my &s;urpri&s;e takes no direct notice of my let|ter to you of the &s;ame date. I pa&s;s by the &s;ingular in&s;inuation which it contains, and confine my|&s;elf to the real bu&s;ine&s;s in que&s;tion between us. I ob&s;erve with regret, that (though you have dropped one of the items which originally com|po&s;ed your claim, the premiums of in&s;urance) you per&s;i&s;t in the idea of retaining exclu&s;ively in your command and di&s;po&s;ition, the whole of my property on the ground of a lien upon it, ari&s;ing from your agency, which according to your own &s;tatement amounts to little more then one fifth of its value, and adhere to your objection, to give me an authorization to re|ceive any part of it. It was ever my inten|tion, and as I conceived imported in my ori|ginal propo&s;itions, to provide for your payment
<PB N="40" REF="034220_0040_0FFECBBD1871CC18">
and &s;ecurity to the extent of your ju&s;t claims, as the condition of the authorization, I de|manded of you to receive what was rightfully coming to me. This was equally the inten|tion of the co-operation propo&s;ed by my let|ter of the &s;ixth, and I continue di&s;po&s;ed to en|ter into that co operation upon this principle. It is true there are &s;everal items in your account about which we differ in opinion; yet <HI>I was</HI> and am ready to make &s;uitable re|&s;ervations and arrangements towards a right adju&s;tment of them, but I cannot imagine that this ought to have prevented, or ought now to impede precautions and mea&s;ures tending to &s;ecure a due application of the proceeds of the cargo, and to put me in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the funds to which I am <HI>indi&s;puta|bly</HI> entitled, and according to the election which was re&s;erved for my benefit in the terms of the contract. On this ground of putting me in a &s;ituation to po&s;&s;e&s;s without delay, that to which I am indi&s;putably enti|tled, and of leaving your ju&s;t and legal claims upon the property, and otherwi&s;e, unimpair|ed, I am &s;till willing to co-operate. But as I conceive there were pretentions and omi&s;&s;ions in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, which render you re&s;|pon&s;ible for con&s;equences, as it may now be too late to repair the deficiency, as every mo|ment's delay increa&s;es the ri&s;ks, I &s;till make the offer of co-operation, on condition of hold|ing you in the &s;ame &s;tate of re&s;pon&s;ibility in which you were prior to that offer. At the &s;ame time it will be explicitly under&s;tood, that in acceding to the co-operation on this condition, you do not incur any new or ad|ditional re&s;pon&s;ibility. With this explana|tion,
<PB N="41" REF="034220_0041_0FFEC1CE47F579C0">
I urge an immediate and po&s;itive an&s;wer whether you will concur in an arrangement on this ba&s;e. Moments are precious. That which might be u&s;eful now, may quickly be|come u&s;ele&s;s by procra&s;tination. The nature of the co-operation will be an after con&s;ider|ation.

<SALUTE>Louis LeGuen, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Your favour of ye&s;terday is received. It is not our wi&s;h to throw any embarra&s;&s;ments in your way, but the magnitude of our claims, and our engagements in your behalf, render it proper that we proceed with caution. To &s;top the &s;hip until the in&s;urance was comple|ted, was not in our power. Me&s;&s;rs. Gomez, Lopez and Rivera &s;tipulated to make in&s;u|rance, but this might be done, as well after, as before the ve&s;&s;el &s;ailed; and if neglected al|together, it would amount to a breach of con|tract only, for which the ve&s;&s;el could not be de|tained. With re&s;pect to the premium for in|&s;urance paid by us, although we omitted it in our la&s;t account, we do not a&s;&s;ent to the force of your objection to the payment of it. The in&s;urance being effected for your bene|fit and &s;ecurity, it is more rea&s;onable that you &s;hould run the hazard of recovering back the premium than we, who act only as agents.
<PB N="42" REF="034220_0042_0FFEC1D04DE4C340">
To remove however every impediment to a &s;ettlement, and manife&s;t a &s;pirit of accommo|dation, this charge has been for the pre&s;ent dropped. We cannot forbear remarking, that notwith&s;tanding your &s;olicitude to obtain the authorization in que&s;tion, you con&s;tant|ly uphold a claim upon us for certain con&s;e|quences, without pouring out in what man|ner we may have rendered our&s;elves re&s;pon&s;i|ble. Although we are not con&s;cious of any act which can give you this claim, and are therefore ea&s;y on this head, yet you cannot but perceive the impropriety of our admit|ting, that we have incurred this re&s;pon&s;ibili|ty, which we &s;hould do, were we to come to a &s;ettlement upon the terms propo&s;ed by you. As to our lien on the notes, and other docu|ments relating to this tran&s;action, we never had any doubt of our right to withhold them, and al&s;o to refu&s;e you any authority to act, until the whole of our demand was &s;atisfied, and we &s;atisfactorily &s;ecured again&s;t contin|gent claims. Indeed as the contract is in our name, and we are bound under a penalty of 20,000 dollars to endor&s;e on the notes, which are al&s;o in our favor, the payments as they are made, we might in&s;i&s;t (were we di&s;|po&s;ed as you in&s;inuate to create difficulties) upon all the the monies pa&s;&s;ing through our hands, or tho&s;e of an agent cho&s;en by us, and for that purpo&s;e keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every pa|per until the tran&s;action was finally clo&s;ed. But we are &s;incerely anxious to put an end to a controver&s;y, which did not originate with us; for this purpo&s;e we beg leave to refer you to our letter of the 6th in&s;tant, in which we were &s;o explicit as to the terms upon
<PB N="43" REF="034220_0043_0FFECB0C6859B640">
which we were willing to give you the au|thority you de&s;ire, and to co-operate with you, that nothing remains to be added. To give you, however, a further proof of our wi&s;h for a &s;peedy and amicable arrangement, we are willing, if the&s;e terms are not agreea|ble to you, to &s;ubmit the whole matter to ar|bitration.</P>

<P>I cannot ea&s;ily expre&s;s my chagrin at your reply of the 12th to my letter of the 12th in|&s;tant. I had hoped that my propo&s;itions would have appeared to you entirely rea&s;onable, or at lea&s;t that you would have made me &s;uch others in return of a &s;pecific nature, as you did your&s;elves approve. But in&s;tead of this, you merely refer me to your former propo&s;i|tions, of which I know not of any except a reference to arbitration&mdash;I am obliged to con|clude &s;till more firmly than heretofore, that it is your determination at all events to re|tain my whole property in your di&s;po&s;ition, till the final winding up of the &s;peculation by Me&s;&s;rs.

Thus depriving me of the election which was referred by the terms of the contract, to receive the money coming to me in Europe, and di&s;appointing all the mea&s;ures I had taken and projected on that ba&s;is. I prote&s;t once more again&s;t this mode of proceeding, and all the con&s;equences of it, and I demand for the la&s;t time, that you forthwith furni&s;h me with an authenticated

Gomez, Lopez and Rivera, after fir&s;t deducting and re&s;erving at your di&s;po&s;al, &s;uch &s;um as &s;hall be completely &s;ufficient to cover you for the general balance of your account, and for all that you have made your|&s;elves accountable for on my account, al&s;o for the commi&s;&s;ions you claim as well on the receipt as on the &s;ale, and even for damages in ca&s;e of prote&s;t of the bill of exchange to be drawn for the freight or charter money, and for in&s;urance of the money which you claim to cover you for your advances and re&s;pon&s;ibilities to the United States. This neverthele&s;s is not to be under&s;tood as a final admi&s;&s;ion of any claims on your part, which may not be according to law, and the u&s;age of trade; but as a preliminary arrangement for your eventual &s;ecurity. I further declare, that any other &s;ecurity you now rightfully po&s;&s;e&s;s is to remain unimpaired by your com|pliance with this demand. As I am not le&s;s anxious than you can be, to terminate this di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, I hope for your immediate an&s;wer, agreeing or refu&s;ing to comply with this my demand.</P>

We wanted Mr. Baretto to leave us the certificate, to &s;ee if it could be made to an|&s;wer that purpo&s;e, as it was irregular; but he objected to it before he had &s;een Mr. Cherri|ot. Since then we have heard nothing further

Di|rections were given Mr. Gomez for that pur|po&s;e re&s;pecting the goods under his care, but the &s;ugar que&s;tion he never had any thing to do with. That unfortunate adventure of Mr. Gomez, as we were well aware of, is like to turn to a ruinous account.

We herewith inclo&s;e it to you, together with copies of a letter from Mr. Gomez to us, and one to Go|mez, Lopez and Rivera, for your government, to adopt &s;uch &s;teps as you may think proper, to the end of pre&s;erving your property.</P>

<P>I herewith enclo&s;e the certificate of the landing of the cargo here, to enable you to recover the drawback, according to your de|&s;ire. Markets being in a mo&s;t mi&s;erable &s;itu|ation in France, induced me to bring the cot|ton and indigo here, which proves as bad, as it will not yield the amount of invoice and expences attending it, by at lea&s;t &s;ixty per cent. of which I have by this opportunity in|formed my hou&s;e, who will confer with you on the occa&s;ion.

<P>With your favor of the 4th in&s;t. I receiv|ed the certificate which Mr. Gomez has &s;ent you of the landing at Hamburgh of the cot|ton and indigo per &s;hip White Fox, which not being drawn conformably to the in&s;truc|tions you had given him, has been rejected by the collector of the cu&s;toms. Not being my|&s;elf well acquainted with the forms pre&s;crib|ed, and not knowing the in&s;tructions you may have given Mr. Gomez, I cannot judge in what point it is deficient, but I think there is yet time enough to have it corrected; and I return it with this letter, &s;o that you make of it what u&s;e you think fit. The &s;ame let|ter covered al&s;o copy of a letter from Mr. Go|mez to your hou&s;e, dated at Hamburgh the 12th of Augu&s;t; with another copy of a letter which the &s;ame gentleman wrote the &s;ame day to his hou&s;e of Gomez, Lopez and Ri|vera. I am &s;orry to &s;ee that affair turn out &s;o unfavorably, and the lo&s;s which tho&s;e gen|tlemen are likely to &s;uffer from it. It is one of tho&s;e accidents to which every &s;peculation of that kind is expo&s;ed; and I am yet in hopes that the re&s;ult will not be &s;o unfavora|ble as Mr. Gomez, &s;eems to apprehend, by the &s;tart of the price of cotton in the London

market, and a little patience. However the bu&s;ine&s;s may turn out. I &s;hould hope that you have taken every precaution to in&s;ure to your&s;elves the whole amount of the obliga|tions of Me&s;&s;rs. Gomez, Lopez and Rivera, and &s;hould be very &s;orry if you were to &s;uffer on account of the i&s;&s;ue of that operation. For my part I can do no more than to refer you to what I propo&s;ed in my preceding let|ters, and repeat again to you, that I am yet di&s;po&s;ed to co-operate with you, and ready to take the mea&s;ures which might appear mo&s;t advi&s;able for the pre&s;ervation of that property: provided always. that that co-op|eration &s;hall not in the lea&s;t impair my claim to your re&s;pon&s;ibility; re&s;erving to my&s;elf at the &s;ame time all my rights to it, as if &s;uch a co-operation had not taken place.</P>

<P>I have received your two letters of the 7th and 8th in&s;tant, the la&s;t inclo&s;ing one from Me&s;s. Gomez, Lopez and Rivera of the 7th. You are perfectly appri&s;ed of the ground on which I conceive my&s;elf to &s;tand.

With this &s;aving, which I make once for all, as to what I now add, or may hereafter &s;ay upon the &s;ubject, I reply, to your fir&s;t letter, that I think it would be for the intere&s;t of all concerned, that the proceeds of the cargo in Hamburgh &s;hould be paid in|to the hands of, and depo&s;ited with &s;ome per|&s;on or hou&s;e, of unque&s;tionable re&s;pon&s;ibility.

To your &s;econd letter, that were I in con&s;ideration of the probably unfortunate i&s;&s;ue of the adventure (rendered &s;o however, as I conceive, from ill management) di&s;po&s;ed to make a voluntary &s;acrifice, the propo&s;ition of Me&s;&s;.

<P>We wi&s;hed for your &s;ake to pur&s;ue &s;uch joint mea&s;ures, with re&s;pect to the property fold Me&s;&s;. Gomez, Lopez and Rivera, as the intere&s;t of all parties naturally pointed out, and under this impre&s;&s;ion addre&s;&s;ed you on the 7th and 8th in&s;tant. Your an&s;wer &s;ati&s;|fies us that you have no other object in view, than to induce us to take &s;ome &s;teps that may place us in a &s;ituation of re&s;pon&s;ibility, which we do not think proper to incur. As to our having already rendered our&s;elves an&s;werable for the amount of the &s;ales, we do not believe you &s;eriou&s;ly entertain the idea your&s;elf, and therefore think it unnece&s;&s;ary to wa&s;te much time in expo&s;ing the futility of &s;uch a pre|ten&s;ion. The only definite terms upon which you ever demanded the authorization, which is made the pretext of a mi&s;under&s;tanding be|tween us, and which are contained in your letter of the 12th June, are &s;uch as we con|ceived our&s;elves warranted in rejecting at that time, and have had no rea&s;on to change our opinion. The rea&s;ons which influenced us have already been detailed, and are too ob|vious to require repetition. To di&s;cu&s;s this point further will neither be plea&s;ant nor u&s;e|ful.

in any &s;hape you may choo&s;e to bring it for|ward, in full confidence of having di&s;charged our tru&s;t with integrity, and every proper at|tention to your intere&s;t, and a perfect reliance on tho&s;e tribunals which mu&s;t ultimately de|cide between us. Under a conviction, how|ever, that it is your wi&s;h that we may a&s;&s;ume a di&s;cretion which may eventually render us liable, we think proper to inform you that we &s;hall not empower any hou&s;e in Europe to re|ceive any payment on the notes we hold, with|out an expre&s;s authority from you in wri|ting for that purpo&s;e. Unle&s;s we receive ex|plicit directions from you on this head, we &s;hall think it our duty to wait until the mo|ney is remitted to this country, or until we receive advice that it is placed in Europe, &s;o as to be commanded by us without any ri&s;que.

We have only to add, that although a further corre&s;pondence will probably be productive of no &s;alutary con|&s;equences, yet we &s;hall ever continue ready, until the final &s;ettlement of this bu&s;ine&s;s, to li&s;ten to &s;uch in&s;tructions as you may have a right to give, and we can con&s;i&s;tently with our own &s;afety and intere&s;t pur&s;ue.</P>

<P>Gouverneur and Kemble's compliments to Mr. LeGuen, and acquaint him, that they are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the information re&s;pecting the operations of Mr. Gomez in England, which makes it nece&s;&s;ary the power &s;hould go forward to Me&s;&s;rs.

<HEAD>IN THE COURT OF ERRORS. ISAAC GOUVERNEUR &amp; PETER KEMBLE, Pltffs. v. LOUIS LEGUEN, Defendant.</HEAD>
<P>THE following was, by con&s;ent of parties, to be deemed a part of the record, e|qually as if it had been a formal bill of ex|ceptions, viz. <Q>On the trial of this cau&s;e, the coun&s;el for the defendants in&s;i&s;ted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bill of ex|ception.</NOTE> that the plaintiff had not &s;u&s;tained any &s;pecial dam|age; and, to &s;hew that, they offered evi|dence, and produced a witne&s;s to prove, that the cargo of the &s;hip White-Fox went to Havre de Grace; that finding the mar|ket bad they proceeded to Hamburgh, where the market being al&s;o bad, the car|go was carried to London, which was the be&s;t market in Europe, and there &s;old for a higher price than could have been had in either of the other ports; which evidence was over-ruled by the court.</Q></P>
<P>Rea&s;ons of their judgment in the court be|low, a&s;&s;igned by Mr. Ju&s;tice Lan&s;ing (in the intermediate time appointed Chief Ju&s;|tice) and Mr. Ju&s;tice Ben&s;on&mdash;</P>

<P N="1">1&s;t. For not electing, pur&s;uant to his in&s;truc|tions, to receive the proceeds of certain parcels of cotton and indigo in Europe: And</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="77" REF="034220_0077_0FFECB50C46CF710">
2dly. For not giving to the defendant autho|rity to receive at the port of di&s;charge, &s;o much of the proceeds of the &s;ales of &s;uch cotton and indigo as remained, after deduct|ing a &s;um &s;ufficient to cover the plaintiffs for the general balance of their account, and other claims and re&s;pon&s;ibilities, in con|&s;equence of their agency.</P>
<P>This action, in its con&s;equences affecting private intere&s;ts, of uncommon magnitude, has been &s;trenuou&s;ly contended between the parties, in every &s;tage of its progre&s;s which would admit of urging their adver&s;e and totally irreconcilable preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>In the ardor of controver&s;y they have however conceded the&s;e points, which with|out their conce&s;&s;ion would not admit of a doubt&mdash;That in ordinary ca&s;es a factor is bound to comply with the in&s;tructions of his principal, in the di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;ubject entru&s;ted to his care&mdash;That the factor has a lien on it, for all his advances, commi&s;&s;ions and re&s;pon&s;ibilities; and that he is not com|pellable to part with the &s;ubject or its pro|duction, <HI>if not converted into ca&s;h,</HI> until tho&s;e demands are completely &s;atisfied; for, if the &s;ubject is converted into ca&s;h, the rea&s;on for pledging the whole for the &s;ecurity of the factor cea&s;es; as by retaining the &s;um he is entitled to, or re&s;pon&s;ible for, he can incur no farther ri&s;k of failing in an ultimate &s;ati&s;|faction.</P>
<P>No doubt could ari&s;e re&s;pecting the appli|cation of the&s;e principles to this ca&s;e, while
<PB N="78" REF="034220_0078_0FFECB52D6DC4798">
the &s;ubject remained to be di&s;po&s;ed of in the cu&s;tomary mode of &s;ale, at the place it ap|pears both parties originally contemplated a di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>But the parties having by a contract, to which they all a&s;&s;ented, made an arrange|ment to convey the &s;ubject to Europe, their &s;ituation was by that means varied as to the local exerci&s;e of their re&s;pective rights&mdash; which, I take it, by that contract they reci|procally agreed to modify, &s;o as to carry it into effect in all its parts, pre&s;erving their mutual relations and rights, as principals and factors.</P>
<P>The que&s;tions which aro&s;e on the contract were:</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Whether the plaintiffs were bound to elect to receive the proceeds of the &s;ub|ject of factorage in Europe?</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Whether the defendant had a right to exact payment of the &s;urplus from the plaintiffs in Europe, after &s;atisfying the whole amount of their commi&s;&s;ions, ad|vances and re&s;pon&s;ibilities? and</P>
<P N="3">3dly. If the plaintiffs were bound to make &s;uch election and were &s;ubject to make &s;uch payment, what ought to be the mea&s;ure of damages?</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t point&mdash;the &s;ubject of factor|age was evidently entru&s;ted to the plaintiffs for the benefit of the defendant&mdash;his intere&s;t
<PB N="79" REF="034220_0079_0FFECB5465C25608">
was the primary object to be attended to in the conduct of his factors, and every in&s;truc|tion given by him, not incompatible with their rights, it was their duty to conform to and carry into effect&mdash;the election re&s;erved to the plaintiffs by the contract with Gomez, Lopez and Rivera, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be con|&s;idered, as for his benefit and emolument, as in&s;eparably incident to the tru&s;t confided to them&mdash;for every di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;ubject, pur&s;uant to the in&s;tructions of their principal, could only be for his advantage exclu&s;ively; unle&s;s po&s;itive contract detracted from, or made a different modification of his intere&s;ts. From the mo&s;t attentive examination of the contract given in evidence at the trial, I could di&s;cover no traits in it, to &s;atisfy my mind that it was the intent of the parties that this obvious principle &s;hould be departed from&mdash;the re&s;ervation of the rights of election to re|ceive the proceeds of the cotton and indigo, either at New-York or in Europe, and the premium to be received by the plaintiffs, if they &s;hould elect to receive in Europe, were, in my opinion, clearly intended and ought to enure &s;olely for the benefit of the defendant &mdash;if &s;o, the plaintiffs could not, after con|&s;enting to export the &s;ubject, avoid a compli|ance with the in&s;truction of their principal <HI>as to the exerci&s;e of the right of election,</HI> without violating their duty.</P>
<P>As to the &s;econd point it appeared to me that tho' the plaintiffs were not compellable to part with the &s;ubject confided to them as factors, <HI>to be di&s;po&s;ed of at New-York,</HI> &s;o as to permit its exportation, without being &s;atisfied
<PB N="80" REF="034220_0080_0FFECB55F41223A0">
for the whole amount of their commi&s;&s;ions, advances and re&s;pon&s;ibilities; yet, that by a&s;&s;enting to the exportation, they virtually &s;tipulated to exerci&s;e the rights they had ac|quired, as factors, at the port of di&s;charge in Europe; by that means relinqui&s;hing the lo|cality of their agency and con&s;enting to leave it at large and thus attaching their rights and duties to the &s;ubject, to be exerted and exer|ci&s;ed at whatever place it might be tran&s;mit|ted to, in pur&s;uance of the contract, to which they were parties, and thus placing them|&s;elves in the &s;ame &s;ituation, and pre&s;erving the &s;ame relations at the port of di&s;charge, as they were placed in, and as &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them at New-York, previous to the arrange|ment contemplated by the contract.</P>
<P>If this is a legal and con&s;i&s;tent expo&s;ition of the contract, it would re&s;ult, that tho' the plaintiffs might retain the controul of the property of their principal, <HI>either per&s;onally or by &s;ub&s;titution of others, whom they &s;uppo&s;ed tru&s;t worthy, and for who&s;e conduct they were content to be re&s;pon&s;ible,</HI> until it was converted into money; yet the in&s;tant it was &s;o con|verted in their hands, or tho&s;e of their agent, it was their duty, after retaining the amount of their commi&s;&s;ions, advances and re&s;pon&s;i|bilities, to pay the &s;urplus to the defendant, at &s;uch port of di&s;charge, if he &s;hould require it, and that as their agency was indi&s;pen&s;ible to enable the defendant to avail him&s;elf of his rights, under the contract in que&s;tion, by becoming parties to it, they expre&s;&s;ed their readine&s;s to do, and &s;ubmitted to the obligation of doing every thing in their power, and which
<PB N="81" REF="034220_0081_0FFECB5890DD8140">
could be rea&s;onably expected from them as factors, to facilitate the arrangement they had acceded to, &s;o as to produce con&s;equences mo&s;t advantageous to their principal, not im|pairing their own rights.</P>
<P>In this ca&s;e the contract was made with, and in the names of the plaintiffs; the de|fendant mu&s;t rely upon their agency, or on authority received from them, to enable him to exert any power in controverting the de&s;|tination, or obtaining any part of the proceeds of the &s;ubject; if they refu&s;ed their aid to ef|fect both or either of the&s;e objects, they were unattainable by the defendant. I hold that he had a right to exact from the plaintiffs this aid, &s;o far as to enable him to receive the &s;ur|plus of the proceeds of the &s;ubject, after &s;atisfying the demands of the plaintiffs at the port of di&s;charge&mdash;that their refu&s;al to autho|ri&s;e him to receive &s;uch &s;urplus, <HI>was a viola|tion of their tru&s;t, which amounted to full evi|dence of an intent to convert the whole to their own u&s;e, regardle&s;s of the intere&s;ts or in&s;tructions of their principal;</HI> and that for &s;uch violation they became liable as in ca&s;es where the fac|tor had contrary to the in&s;tructions of his prin|cipal credited, or credited for a longer period than that limited by &s;uch in&s;tructions&mdash;In both the&s;e ca&s;es it has been held, that the giving &s;uch credit is evidence of a di&s;po&s;ition by the factor on his own account, and <HI>that he is an&s;werable for the amount to his principal, whatever may be the re&s;ult of &s;uch &s;ales.</HI></P>
<P>In giving this opinion, I lay out of the ca&s;e, as totally inapplicable to its real merits, the
<PB N="82" REF="034220_0082_0FFECB5A17EC2D10">
various propo&s;itions reciprocally made and re|jected by the parties&mdash;as propo&s;itions made by one party which the other was not oblig|ed to accede to, they could not influence a deci&s;ion on the que&s;tions which aro&s;e in the cau&s;e&mdash;The demand made by the defendant in his letters of the 15th of June, is &s;uch an one, as I think, the defendant had a right to exact a compliance with, and that the refu&s;al on the part of the plaintiffs to comply with it, was in effect a dereliction of the relation in which they had placed them&s;elves as factors to the defendant, of which he might avail him&s;elf, to hold them accountable for the whole &s;ubject, by &s;ub&s;titution, in&s;tead of Go|mez, Lopez and Rivera.</P>
<P>As to the third point&mdash;</P>
<P>All the facts re&s;pecting this tran&s;action in Europe, were of a nature incapable of being developed in the cour&s;e of legal inve&s;tigation <HI>here,</HI> till &s;everal months after the ve&s;&s;el &s;ailed from New-York&mdash;The defendant's right of action, however, accrued upon the refu&s;al of the plaintiffs to comply with his demand. If we depart from the &s;ubject, and do not con|&s;ider its value as &s;ettled by the contract to which the plaintiffs were parties, I know of none, to which a re&s;ort could be had for the mea&s;ure of damages; and I have, when this cau&s;e was fir&s;t pre&s;ented for my judicial de|termination, &s;ought it with a con&s;iderable de|gree of &s;olicitude, ari&s;ing from the important con&s;equences of that opinion, as affecting the plaintiffs. I could not, however, &s;atisfy my|&s;elf that any other mea&s;ure could be re&s;orted to
<PB N="83" REF="034220_0083_0FFECB5BDBE3E480">
on this occa&s;ion; and if the withdrawing the &s;ubject from the controul of the principal&mdash;if a&s;&s;uming an ab&s;olute and uncontroled di&s;po|&s;ition of it, amounted to a conver&s;ion of the property of the principal by the factors to their own u&s;e, the amount of the &s;ales to Go|mez, Lopez and Rivera, deducting the amount of the plaintiffs' demand, appears to me, to pre&s;ent not only a rea&s;onable, but the only rule of damages in this ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the rea&s;ons which induced the opinion I have given in this cau&s;e. I refrain from &s;aying any thing re&s;pecting the &s;tate of the pleadings as the opinion of the Supreme Court was not particularly required relative to them.

Is the &s;tip|ulation in the fourth article of the contract, re&s;erving an option to the vendors to receive the whole, or any part of the con&s;ideration money for the goods, in Europe, in prefer|ence to leaving it to be receivable in this country, to be adjudged to have been intend|ed for the intere&s;t or benefit of the defend|ant, the <HI>principal,</HI> in&s;tead of being for the in|tere&s;t or benefit of the plaintiffs, the factors or <HI>&s;ub&s;titutes;</HI> or in other words, is the inter|e&s;t or benefit of the defendant, &s;o to be <HI>&s;ep|arated</HI> from, or <HI>paramount</HI> to, any intere&s;t or benefit of the plaintiffs, as to be deem|ed the <HI>end</HI> to have been intended to be an|&s;wered by that &s;tipulation? If &s;o, then&mdash; 2dly. Was what the defendant demanded from the plaintiffs, in his letter to them of the 15th June, 1795, a fit and rea&s;onable <HI>mean</HI> to that end?</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t of the&s;e que&s;tions, it would appear to me that a mere &s;tatement of it precludes the nece&s;&s;ity of proof, or de|mon&s;tration of the truth of the affirmative; if the &s;tipulation &s;pecified in the que&s;tion, is for the intere&s;t or benefit of the plaintiff, I do not &s;ee a rea&s;on for not &s;uppo&s;ing every
<PB N="86" REF="034220_0086_0FFECB61F496A198">
other &s;tipulation in the contract equally &s;o&mdash; I cannot even imagine a rule or te&s;t by which the &s;tipulations intended for the intere&s;t or benefit of the party <HI>principal</HI> are to be di&s;|criminated from tho&s;e which were intended for the intere&s;t or benefit of the party <HI>factors;</HI> &s;o that the rea&s;oning, as I view it, to prove that the &s;tipulation under con&s;ideration was for the intere&s;t or benefit of the plaintiffs, mu&s;t terminate in a conclu&s;ion that the whole contract was intended for their intere&s;t and benefit. The &s;ale of the goods, the per&s;ons to whom, and the terms on which they were &s;old, were by the <HI>"expre&s;s direction"</HI> of the defendant; the plaintiffs accept and &s;ubmit to the direction; they are mere in&s;truments to effect what he had determined was for his <HI>own,</HI> not what was for <HI>their,</HI> intere&s;t and ben|efit&mdash;The &s;ale was of the un&s;old re&s;idue of the cargo of the &s;hip Cleopatra, received by the plaintiffs to be &s;old on account of the defend|ant; had the plaintiffs a <HI>different</HI> or a <HI>greater</HI> intere&s;t or benefit in the <HI>la&s;t</HI> &s;ale than they had in the <HI>preceding</HI> &s;ales? In their accounts, their <HI>commi&s;&s;ions</HI> are the only intere&s;t or ben|efit they claim. On a calculation of <HI>who&s;e</HI> profit or advantage was it to be, to elect hav|ing the con&s;ideration money for the goods made payable in Europe, in&s;tead of leaving it to be payable in this country? Was it to be on a calculation of profit or advantage to the plaintiffs? To who&s;e <HI>u&s;e</HI> was the <HI>premium,</HI> or in effect <HI>additional price,</HI> of five per cent. on the goods to be, in the event of the option to receive the money in Europe; to the <HI>u&s;e</HI> of the plaintiffs or to the <HI>u&s;e</HI> of the defendant? Mo&s;t certainly to the u&s;e of the latter; and
<PB N="87" REF="034220_0087_0FFECB6387640F30">
that con&s;ideration alone appears to me to fur|ni&s;h an argument deci&s;ive on the point; and I will only add, that the truth of the propo&s;i|tion, that the &s;ale in que&s;tion, and every term and condition of it, is to be con&s;idered as in|tended for the intere&s;t or benefit of the de|fendant, <HI>primary</HI> to, and <HI>exclu&s;ive</HI> of, any in|tere&s;t or benefit to the plaintiffs, except their commi&s;&s;ions, is &s;o evident to my mind, that it is not without difficulty I can per&s;uade my|&s;elf that I have rightly under&s;tood the plain|tiffs' coun&s;el, when I &s;uppo&s;e they meant to contend for any thing different from or con|trary to it.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the &s;econd que&s;tion al&s;o, I think the truth is not le&s;s obvious, and that it ought almo&s;t to &s;uffice merely to &s;tate, that to &s;uppo&s;e the right to elect to have the money receivable in Europe, &s;hould be re&s;erved for the intere&s;t or benefit of the defendant, and con&s;equently that the plaintiffs were bound in virtue of their tru&s;t, to exert this <HI>right</HI> for him, whenever he &s;hould require them, and that they &s;hould at the &s;ame time have a <HI>right</HI> to refu&s;e to enable him to receive the balance there, but to withhold it from him, until, after having been received there by them or their agent, it &s;hould be remitted to this country, is to &s;uppo&s;e two <HI>rights</HI> in one and the <HI>&s;ame</HI> &s;ubject, claimed by oppo&s;ite par|ties again&s;t each other, and which can never be made to <HI>con&s;i&s;t together.</HI> Where was the inconvenience or grievance of which the plaintiffs could complain, if they were to be held to pay the defendant his balance in Eu|rope? The bu&s;ine&s;s of receiving the money
<PB N="88" REF="034220_0088_0FFECB660A001EA0">
from the vendees of the goods, of making out and &s;ettling the account with the defendant, and paying him the balance, could have been done by an agent; not &s;o conveniently to the plaintiffs, it may be admitted, as if done in this country; but was the inconvenience of doing the&s;e acts by <HI>another</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>them|&s;elves,</HI> or <HI>abroad</HI> at a &s;ea-port in Europe in|&s;tead of at <HI>home,</HI> &s;uch as the law mu&s;t intend the hazard of it not to have been within the tru&s;t or agency?

The objections to the demand of the defendant for an authorization to receive his balance in Europe, as declared by the plaintiffs them&s;elves in their letter, in an&s;wer to the demand, are, <Q>that they were not o|bliged to receive payment in France, e&s;|pecially at a time when &s;o many difficulties attended getting money from that coun|try, and that if they were to accede to the terms held out by the defendant, they would be obliged to wait the event of an application for the money to the vendees of the goods, before they could have re|cour&s;e to the defendant for the payment of the balance of their account.</Q> I have already expre&s;&s;ed the rea&s;ons of my opinion, that the defendant had a right to demand from the plaintiffs to declare an option to re|ceive the money in Europe; and it is only
<PB N="89" REF="034220_0089_0FFECB689D23ABC8">
requi&s;ite in addition to &s;tate, that this right of the defendant could never depend on a greater or le&s;s degree of difficulty, if any, to the plaintiffs in getting their portion of the money, their commi&s;&s;ions and di&s;bur&s;ements, from that country; and further, that if the plaintiffs had at any time brought a &s;uit a|gain&s;t the defendant, or as they have expre&s;&s;|ed it, <Q>had recour&s;e to him, or applied to him in a <HI>Judicial</HI> way,</Q> for the payment of their demand, it is not po&s;&s;ible he could have avail|ed him&s;elf of the authorization from them, to receive his balance in Europe, to any po&s;&s;ible purpo&s;e of defence whatever. Let the <HI>fact that the plaintiffs had furni&s;hed him with the authorization, and on the terms as contained in his letter,</HI> be put in the form of a <HI>plea,</HI> and it will in&s;tantly be di&s;covered to be &s;carcely better than a nullity.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the rea&s;ons for my judgment, that the defendant, as plaintiff in the court below, had maintained his i&s;&s;ue on the fir&s;t count of the declaration.</P>
<P>The remaining que&s;tion is, as to the rule by which the jury have a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the damages, and which from the record appears to have been "the amount agreed on by the contract as the price of the cotton and indigo," Dama|ges, whether the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment of them is by the court as their <HI>immediate</HI> act, or by a reference to a jury, are to be according to <HI>definite</HI> rules; but where there can be no definite rule in the ca&s;e, as for in&s;tance, where <HI>exemplary</HI> or <HI>implied</HI> damages would be warranted, &s;till the
<PB N="90" REF="034220_0090_0FFECB6A4EC53060">
a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment is not to be <HI>wholly</HI> without rule, it is to be according to <HI>legal</HI> di&s;cretion or arbi|trament. The ca&s;e of a returned prote&s;ted bill of exchange, is a ca&s;e of a <HI>definite</HI> rule; the damages are to be twenty per cent. on the a|mount of the bill, with intere&s;t from notice of the prote&s;t, and the co&s;ts of the prote&s;t, with|out any enquiry, and con&s;equently without any addition or diminution, in con&s;ideration that the plaintiff hath or hath not &s;u&s;tained more or le&s;s, or any &s;pecial or indeed any <HI>ac|tual</HI> damage whatever&mdash;Suits in trover and in tre&s;pa&s;s for carrying away goods, are al&s;o &s;o far u&s;ually ca&s;es of definite rule, as that the damages are to be at lea&s;t the value of the goods at the time of the conver&s;ion or tre&s;|pa&s;s, or in other words, at the time <HI>when the right of action accrued,</HI> without regard to any &s;ub&s;equent deterioation, however ca&s;ual&mdash;I &s;tate <HI>at lea&s;t</HI> the value of the goods, for the damages may be made <HI>to exceed</HI> that amount where the withholding or taking the goods was <HI>aggravatedly</HI> injurious&mdash;The ca&s;e now before the court is within the rea&s;on, and therefore within the rule, in the ca&s;es of tro|ver and tre&s;pa&s;s. I have already mentioned &s;uch of the rights of the factor as can have any relation to the que&s;tions between the pre|&s;ent parties, I now briefly &s;tate his duty <HI>gen|erally</HI> to be, that he is to follow the orders of his principal, and for a breach of the orders he is to an&s;wer in damages to his principal; if the breach is <HI>merely</HI> PARTIAL, and as to certain parcels or particulars only, he &s;hall not be held to an&s;wer further than as to &s;uch parcels or particulars; but if the breach is &s;uch as to involve the <HI>whole</HI> of the property
<PB N="91" REF="034220_0091_0FFECB6BED0C5558">
intru&s;ted to him, he &s;hall then be held to an|&s;wer for the value of the <HI>whole</HI> of the proper|ty, and as &s;uch value was, <HI>at the time the breach of orders took place;</HI> and if the proper|ty con&s;i&s;ted in credits, to an&s;wer <HI>to the amount of the credits&mdash;</HI> The principal may from that moment abandon to him the <HI>whole</HI> of the property. Whenever the principal, in order to a &s;uit again&s;t the factor for not delivering up the property when ordered or required, tenders a &s;um for commi&s;&s;ions and other de|mands, the principal tenders and the factor refu&s;es at their peril re&s;pectively; for if it &s;hould appear that the &s;um tendered was &s;uf|ficient, the principal will recover the value of the property at the time of the tender; and the rule is the &s;ame, whenever the factor refu|&s;es to do an act which the principal was en|titled to demand, and which affects the <HI>whole</HI> of the property of the principal. If &s;uch are the duties of the factor, and if &s;uch is the mea&s;ure of the damages or retribution to the principal for his injury, where the&s;e duties have been violated or departed from, the con|clu&s;ion, that the damages were duly a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in the pre&s;ent &s;uit, is obvious.</P>
<P>I clo&s;e with remarking, that the controver|&s;y between the parties may be &s;atisfactorily re&s;olved in this as its cau&s;e, that the plain|tiffs have accepted an agency, and bound them&s;elves to execute it in a <HI>foreign</HI> country, if their principal &s;hould at any time elect it to be mo&s;t for his benefit, without previou&s;ly calculating and providing for their own pro|fit and &s;ecurity, if it &s;hould then come in competition with his; and that afterwards

<P>Ca&s;es delivered into court by the parties re&s;|pectively, omitting the recapitulation of the facts found by the &s;pecial verdict.</P>
<P>Ca&s;e on the part of the plaintiffs.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;e on the part of the plaintiffs in error.</NOTE> The Su|preme Court having given judgment for the defendant, who was plaintiff below on this verdict (three judges to two) the plaintiffs (the defendants below) have pro&s;ecuted a writ of error, returnable into this honorable court, and a&s;&s;ign the following rea&s;ons, why the &s;aid judgment &s;hould be rever&s;ed&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">I. Becau&s;e no good cau&s;e of action is &s;ta|ted in the defendant's declaration, the prin|cipal averment of which is directly contrary to a written contract under &s;eal, and mo&s;t pro|bably contrary to the &s;en&s;e and meaning of the parties to the &s;uit. The averment allud|ed to is, that the right to receive payment in Europe, <HI>out of the proceeds,</HI> was intended for the &s;pecial benefit of Mr. LeGuen. It is an e&s;tabli&s;hed rule of law, that no averment &s;hall be admitted, to contradict a deed under &s;eal.</P>
<P N="2">II. Becau&s;e, the jury have <HI>not</HI> found that this right was for the &s;pecial benefit of the
<PB N="93" REF="034220_0093_0FFECB7042344CF0">
defendant. The court, therefore, cannot pre|&s;ume this was the ca&s;e, e&s;pecially as it is op|po&s;ed to another part of the verdict, which &s;tates, that the contract, as it appears on re|cord, was made by the intervention and ex|pre&s;s con&s;ent and direction of Mr. LeGuen; and being an averment e&s;&s;ential to the de|fendant's recovery, it ought to have been proved as any other fact, and might have been proved as &s;uch, if it had really been the ca&s;e by producing an agreement in writing for that purpo&s;e from the plaintiffs.</P>
<P N="3">III. Becau&s;e, it is repugnant to every rule of con&s;truction, to admit any interpretation of a written contract, directly oppo&s;ed to the <HI>latter of it.</HI> To receive the money in Europe might have been a principal inducement to the plaintiffs' lending their names to this tran&s;|action. Whether it was &s;o or not, it is &s;uffi|cient to &s;ay, that by the terms of the con|tract, <HI>they</HI> are to have the election, and <HI>they</HI> are to appoint an agent to receive the money.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Becau&s;e, no good con&s;ideration is &s;ta|ted for the promi&s;e alledged to be made by the plaintiff, in the fir&s;t count of the declara|tion. It is &s;aid it was their <Q><HI>duty</HI> to pur&s;ue the direction and reque&s;t of the defendant, touching the exerci&s;e of this right,</Q> and that in con&s;ideration of this duty, they agreed &s;o to do. The con&s;ideration here &s;tated, is &s;ub&s;equent to the &s;ale, and precludes every idea of an antecedent agreement on the part of the plaintiffs, to pur&s;ue &s;uch direction and reque&s;t; &s;uch agreement is not even pretend|ed to exi&s;t. To determine it was their duty
<PB N="94" REF="034220_0094_0FFECB7202DCE518">
&s;o to do, the court mu&s;t fir&s;t get rid of a contract, which &s;o far from impo&s;ing it as a duty on them, left <HI>it at their option</HI> to make the elec|tion or not as they plea&s;ed, and left to them <HI>alone,</HI> and not to Mr. LeGuen, the choice of an agent. The words of the contract are, they may at <HI>their option</HI> receive, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="5">V. Becau&s;e, the declaration is altogether uncertain and contradictory. In one part it avers, that the right re&s;erved to receive <HI>the proceeds</HI> in Europe, was for the advantage of Mr. LeGuen, &s;ubject only to the <HI>lien</HI> and <HI>right</HI> of the plaintiffs, to <HI>have and receive</HI> the gen|eral balance of their account, and to be &s;e|cured for &s;uch other claims and demands as they might and <HI>&s;hould</HI> be entitled to and have, by rea&s;on of their agency for the &s;aid defend|ant. Thus admitting, without any <HI>qualifica|tion,</HI> and in its fulle&s;t latitude, the lien for which the plaintiffs contend. But by another averment it is &s;tated, that the plaintiffs were bound to give him an authority to receive the&s;e proceeds, after certain re&s;ervations and deductions, that is, as he explains it, after leaving in the hands of Gomez, Lopez and Rivera, a &s;um &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy them for their general balance and the claims afore|&s;aid. Which two averments are. directly re|pugnant to each other, the one admitting, and the other de&s;troying every idea of a lien.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The declaration is uncertain in ano|ther re&s;pect, and therefore al&s;o had. The de|fendant avers, that he reque&s;ted the plaintiffs to elect to receive the proceeds of the proper|ty, <HI>or</HI> &s;o much as would be due to him, after
<PB N="95" REF="034220_0095_0FFECB74113D3D10">
certain re&s;ervations and deductions. But it does not appear what was the amount of tho&s;e re&s;ervations and deductions; on the contrary, it re&s;ults from the verdict that the&s;e very &s;ums were matters in di&s;pute between the parties. It became, therefore, impo&s;&s;ible to give the authority in the way it was demanded.</P>
<P N="7">VII. The declaration is defective in ano|ther re&s;pect; the action being brought for a refu&s;al to give the defendant a power to re|ceive the price of the cotton and indigo in Europe, after certain re&s;ervations, it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to aver, as the very gift of the action, that the property was &s;old in Europe. This averment is neither found in the declaration, nor is the want of it &s;upplied by any part of the verdict; and unle&s;s &s;uch &s;ale took place, the power became nugatory, and no damage could en&s;ue from a refu&s;al to give it.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. The declaration is al&s;o had, becau&s;e all the inferences and deductions made by the defendant, in the fir&s;t count, are contrary to the known and e&s;tabli&s;hed laws which govern relations between principals and factors.</P>
<P N="9">IX. But if the defendant's con&s;truction of the contract be ju&s;t; if the right to receive the proceeds in Europe was re&s;erved for his &s;pecial benefit, it does not at all weaken the plaintiffs' defence; becau&s;e, as factors, they had a valid lien, or a right to hold all the notes and &s;ecurities of the defendant in their hands, and al&s;o to keep at their control and di&s;po&s;al the price of the goods, until actually
<PB N="96" REF="034220_0096_0FFECB76AB5DE208">
received by them or their agent, not only as a &s;ecurity for the general balance due to them, but for all their incidental charges and advan|ces, and al&s;o for their indemnification again&s;t all engagements and re&s;pon&s;ibilities which they had come under on the defendant's ac|count. They had al&s;o, in virtue of this lien, a right to refu&s;e the defendant po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any of the papers, and every facility towards obtaining his money, until it was actually re|ceived by them or their agent in Europe, or until they were paid, their advances, and &s;a|tisfactorily indemnified again&s;t every claim, however contingent or remote.</P>
<P>The doctrine of the court below was, that they had a right to in&s;i&s;t on actual payment, not only, for their balance, but for every e|ventual engagement what&s;oever.</P>

<P N="10">X. Becau&s;e the plaintiffs' lien, if any they had, which is admitted by the declaration, extended to the whole &s;ubject; not to a por|tion or re&s;idue of if, as it is pretended; and therefore they were not bound to li&s;ten to a|ny propo&s;al, however plau&s;ible, which in the &s;malle&s;t degree impaired their &s;ecurity. A lien is defined to be, <Q>That <HI>hold or tie</HI> which a man has upon goods, or other things in his cu&s;tody, or on <HI>the price of goods in the hands of buyers,</HI> and by which he has a right to retain them until he is <HI>paid</HI> what is <HI>due</HI> to him, and al&s;o the <HI>&s;ums for which he may have become &s;urety for his principal.</HI></Q> This is the only true and natural definition of a lien; a lien in the <HI>qualified</HI> and <HI>re&s;trictive</HI> &s;en&s;e of the defendant was never heard of un|til this day. If a <HI>&s;ingle authority,</HI> out of <HI>any hook whatever,</HI> can be produced in &s;upport of this novel and unheard of doctrine, the plain|tiffs will abandon this ground of their defence as de&s;parate and untenable.</P>
<P>The Judge who delivered the opinion of the Supreme Court in this cau&s;e, admitted that a factor may <HI>retain</HI> for his di&s;bur&s;ements and re&s;pon&s;ibilities entered into on account
<PB N="98" REF="034220_0098_0FFECB7A37111F48">
of his principal; and the defendant admits that by his propo&s;al of the 15th June, it was implied that the plaintiffs &s;hould be paid and indemnified, as a <HI>condition</HI> on which <HI>only</HI> he was to receive the authorization required.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o contrary to the under&s;tanding of Mr. LeGuen, as expre&s;&s;ed in his letters.</P>
<P N="11">XI. If the plaintiffs had this lien, they &s;ay they were not bound to accede to any one of the offers of the defendant. The&s;e offers will be examined at large in the argument on their part, and it will be &s;hewn that every one of them went to the total de&s;truction of their lien as factors.</P>
<P N="12">XII. But if the plaintiffs' lien was only of the partial kind admitted in <HI>one part</HI> of the defendant's declaration, they contend that all his offers were inadmi&s;&s;ible, as any one, if ac|ceded to, would have put it in the defend|ant's power to have defeated <HI>the operation of it altogether,</HI> even within the limits he admit|ted it to exi&s;t. This will be al&s;o clearly &s;hewn in the cour&s;e of the argument.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. The plaintiffs maintain there is no|thing in this tran&s;action which differs it from the common ca&s;es of principals and factors. If any clau&s;es were in&s;erted in this contract of &s;ale for the benefit of the principal, is not this the ca&s;e in every &s;ale by a factor? Have not all &s;uch &s;ales in view, as a primary object, the principal's benefit? But was it ever before heard that the particular terms of the &s;ale, or the mode or place of payment, controled the
<PB N="99" REF="034220_0099_0FFECB7BC2E45F28">
lien of the factor who negociated it? Suppo&s;e Mr. LeGuen had wi&s;hed to receive his mo|ney in Lapland or Peru, would it not be ab|&s;urd to &s;ay that Me&s;&s;rs. Gouverneur and Kem|ble would <HI>al&s;o</HI> be bound to follow the pur|cha&s;ers to tho&s;e countries? Would it not on the contrary be a &s;trong rea&s;on for their in|&s;i&s;ting on payment here, before they gave their principal any authority to receive what was coming to him abroad. The truth is, the terms of a contract between a factor and pur|cha&s;er have nothing to do with the rights of the former as again&s;t the principal&mdash;Innume|rable and various as &s;uch contracts mu&s;t have been in this country and in Europe, &s;uch a propo&s;ition was never heard of before. Here again the plaintiffs require <HI>but one &s;olitary</HI> le|gal authority in &s;upport of this doctrine, and they will give up the controver&s;y. A lien is a right &s;o attached to and inherent in a fac|tor, as to be paramount to every claim of his principal&mdash;It is a right conferred on him by law, not depending on the will of the princi|pal&mdash;No agreement is nece&s;&s;ary to give it ef|ficacy&mdash;no mode in which the principal may chu&s;e to vend his goods&mdash;no way in which he may fix the payment&mdash;no country to which the purcha&s;ers may be going&mdash;no nation of which the principal may be a citizen&mdash;no in|convenience to which he may be expo&s;ed&mdash;no terms for his benefit which may be en|grafted into the contract of &s;ale, can alter, dimini&s;h or de&s;troy tho&s;e rights to which his factor becomes entitled, according to the u|&s;age of trade, the moment he &s;teps forward in that capacity to a&s;&s;i&s;t in or lend his name to the &s;ale. Doubts and perplexities, ince&s;|&s;ant
<PB N="100" REF="034220_0100_0FFECB7D4ADF18A8">
and endle&s;s, as the nature of contracts, would re&s;ult from a contrary doctrine, in the place of that &s;imple and uniform rule which now prevails. At pre&s;ent, every merchant knows he has a lien or hold on the goods of his employer, for the balance of his account and his collateral undertakings. It matters not whether he is directed to takenotes payable at Havre-de-Grace or at the bank of New-York; his lien in either ca&s;e is preci&s;ely the &s;ame: In the former ca&s;e, indeed, the lien of an American factor &s;hould be more highly favored and pro|tected, becau&s;e his ri&s;que, where payment is to be made abroad, is con&s;iderably enhanced.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. But if the plaintiffs were bound to receive payment in Europe and to pur&s;ue the purcha&s;ers thither&mdash;they contend that their lien extended to the whole price of the goods in that country, and that they were not bound to give a power to the defendant to receive any part of the&s;e proceeds until they were actually received by an agent of their appointing, in who&s;e hands they might make the re&s;ervations and deductions which the defendant allows they were entitled unto.</P>
<P N="15">XV. If the plaintiffs had no lien whatev|er, they were not bound to give the defen|dant the authority he demanded without an <HI>indemnity</HI> which has never been offered.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Becau&s;e the contract being in the name of Gouverneur and Kemble and containing a heavy penalty, no &s;uit could be brought upon it, but in their name; if then they had given Mr. LeGuen the authority he a&s;k|ed,
<PB N="101" REF="034220_0101_0FFECB7FD86452E0">
and <HI>when</HI> he a&s;ked it, and he had abu|&s;ed it, they might have expo&s;ed them&s;elves to the penalty of the contract, or at lea&s;t to an action of covenant for damages. That he might have abu&s;ed it, appears from what is &s;tated to be the cu&s;tom of Normandy.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. They were not bound to give the authority <HI>until a &s;ale,</HI> becau&s;e the property being warranted American, and Mr. LeGuen being a French citizen, &s;uch authority in ca&s;e of di&s;covery would have expo&s;ed the cargo to capture and condemnation, and thus have vitiated the policies which in ca&s;e of lo&s;s were the plaintiffs only &s;ecurity. If by &s;uch an act the plaintiffs had expo&s;ed the car|go, the purcha&s;ers al&s;o would have had a claim on them for damages.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. The defendant ought not to recover; becau&s;e, if the plaintiffs have been guilty of a neglect or breach of duty, the defendant &s;u&s;tained no injury, and therefore is not en|titled to any damages. The jury refer it to the court to &s;ay whether the plaintiffs have made them&s;elves liable to pay the amount a|greed on by the contract, as the price of the property. This &s;ufficiently &s;hews, whatever arguments may be urged to the contrary, what rule the jury ob&s;erved in a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing dam|ages, and precludes every idea of any &s;pe|cial injury.&mdash;From the whole verdict it man|ife&s;tly appears none was proved or &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>Every action on the ca&s;e <HI>ex contractu,</HI> is brought to recover "pecuniary &s;atisfaction <HI>for the damage &s;u&s;tained."</HI> It does not follow
<PB N="102" REF="034220_0102_0FFECB81E36FF5E0">
that an injury is the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of every mi&s;conduct in a factor&mdash;ca&s;es can and will be put in the cour&s;e of the argu|ment to illu&s;trate this po&s;ition, and even to &s;hew that a principal may &s;ometimes be <HI>bene|fited</HI> by a palpable breach of orders in the factor; in which ca&s;e it would be ab&s;urd to, &s;ay the latter &s;hould make him any compen|&s;ation. That in an action on the ca&s;e, ground|ed on contract, the plaintiff is entitled to a compen&s;ation commen&s;urate only with the <HI>damage actually</HI> &s;u&s;tained, is one of tho&s;e &s;elf evident legal axioms which almo&s;t pre|cludes the po&s;&s;ibility of demon&s;tration; ca&s;es however, numerous and in point will be pro|duced.</P>

Profe&s;&s;or Woodde&s;on al&s;o, in his view of the law, declares that &s;uch actions are for the breach of a promi&s;e, <Q>to recover <HI>pecuniary &s;atisfaction</HI> for <HI>the damage thereby &s;u&s;tain|ed.</HI></Q> If the court can bring them&s;elves to believe contrary to the whole tenor of the verdict, that the defendant has &s;u&s;tained da|mage by our negligence or default in not giving him a power to receive the proceeds of certain property in Europe, which certain|ly if they ever exi&s;ted &s;ell far &s;hort of the a|mount of the notes&mdash;if, we &s;ay, the court can po&s;&s;ibly bring them&s;elves to believe that the plaintiffs are liable and that the defendant has actually &s;uffered damage to the amount of the notes, then and then only can they affirm this judgment&mdash;their undertaking be|ing, as &s;tated on record and as implied by law, not to pay a certain &s;pecific &s;um, but the <HI>damages</HI> which may have accrued to their employer by their default, with which da|mages the amount of the notes has no con|nection.</P>
<P>Even in actions on the ca&s;e for a deceit, although ever &s;o gro&s;s a fraud be practi&s;ed, it is nece&s;&s;ary that &s;ome <HI>injury</HI> be &s;u&s;tained, or no action will lie; the rule in this ca&s;e being, and it has been &s;ettled for centuries pa&s;t in England, that "fraud, without <HI>damage, gives no cau&s;e of action."</HI> In &s;uch ca&s;es, &s;ays Wood|de&s;on, <Q>it is nece&s;&s;ary to remember that the ground of complaint be, that there be <HI>ac|tual detriment injuriou&s;ly &s;u&s;tained.</HI></Q> If this be the ca&s;e, in actions where fraud has been practi&s;ed, how much more &s;trongly does the rule apply in actions on the ca&s;e where mi&s;|conduct

or negligence only and no fraud is alledged; where difference of opinion on a point of duty, but no wilful deception, has occa&s;ioned a controver&s;y between the parties.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. Becau&s;e the rule of damage con|tended for in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e is directly op|po&s;ed to the defendant's declaration. The action is brought for the plaintiffs' refu&s;al to give an authority to the defendant to receive <HI>"the proceeds"</HI> of certain property in Europe after certain deductions. He then avers, and which averment was <HI>material,</HI> that after &s;uch deduction there would remain due to him a large &s;um of money. But why make the averment, if the plaintiffs became re|&s;pon&s;ible to pay <HI>the whole amount of the notes,</HI> the moment they refu&s;ed this authority, whether the property was ever &s;old in Eu|rope or not? For the deci&s;ion of the &s;upreme court warrants the &s;trange principle that the plaintiffs would have been liable for this e|normous &s;um, even if the property had been &s;unk or captured, the moment it left the wharf, in which ca&s;e it is evident the de|fendant would have been injured by cro&s;&s;ing the ocean in que&s;t of a property which as to him no longer exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>On a clo&s;e examination of the &s;pecial ver|dict, and the evidence &s;tated in it, nothing appeared to enable the court to judge wheth|er the property was &s;unk at &s;ea, burnt in port, or &s;old at the be&s;t market in Europe; they refu&s;ed to admit evidence to enlighten them on this point; as appears hereafter. If the ve&s;&s;el had &s;unk the day after &s;he left
<PB N="106" REF="034220_0106_0FFECB898EF329E8">
New-York, which may have been the ca&s;e for aught that appears to the contrary, Mr. LeGuen's &s;ecurity was in his policy of in&s;ur|ance, which it was agreed &s;hould be made for that expre&s;s purpo&s;e; but the deci&s;ion of the court inverts this rule: their language is, that whether the property was &s;unk, burnt, or &s;old at a high price, in all events LeGuen is to be paid the whole amount by Governeur and Kemble, and they are to look to the purcha&s;ers and underwriters for their reim|bur&s;ement.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. Becau&s;e, this being an action on the ca&s;e, for a mi&s;conduct in the plaintiffs as factors, would be no bar to a new &s;uit again&s;t them for <HI>money had and received,</HI> when the price of this property is recovered, if ever that be the ca&s;e, from the purcha&s;ers. The defendant's council have taken care there|fore to let it appear by the verdict, that no evidence was given in the pre&s;ent action on the count for <HI>money had and received;</HI> thus after paying fifty thou&s;and pounds to a man who has not been injured by their act a &s;in|gle cent, they may hereafter be compelled, in an action which is now pending again&s;t them by Mr. LeGuen in the &s;upreme court, to refund to him the &s;um which may be ac|tually received by them from the purcha&s;ers. The &s;um recovered in this action mu&s;t be as a compen&s;ation for the &s;pecial damage &s;u&s;|tained by the agent's default, which cannot deprive the principal of his right to receive the real amount of &s;ales of his property, or the whole &s;um, if they are able to pay, on the notes of the purcha&s;ers; nay, nothing
<PB N="107" REF="034220_0107_0FFECB8B2E36C7B0">
can prevent his compelling the agents to &s;ur|render him tho&s;e notes for pro&s;ecution either before or after the termination of this &s;uit.</P>
<P>Such &s;trange incon&s;i&s;tencies will ever be the con&s;equence of a departure from plain and known rules.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. To place in a more &s;triking view the illegality of the judgment, as it re&s;pects the damages, let us again recur to the nature of the action. It is brought for an injury the defendant is pre&s;umed to have received by the refu&s;al to grant him a certain authority. Hence if he had been injured at all, he ought to have recovered &s;omething <HI>as damages,</HI> o|ver and above and independent of the price of the property&mdash;becau&s;e the price he was always entitled to, when it came into the hands of the plaintiffs, whether they had been guilty of a mi&s;conduct or not; &s;o that if this judgment is to conclude the parties, and Gomez, Lopez and Rivera, were &s;olvent, the plaintiffs pay no damages at all for their mi&s;conduct, and the defendant is compelled by their act to receive his money in this coun|try, without even the five per cent. premi|um, or any other equivalent for the di&s;ad|vantage which is impo&s;ed upon him by the plaintiffs. This &s;hews both that the judg|ment is not conclusive between the parties, and that factors, by &s;ub&s;tituting them&s;elves as payma&s;ters, can always compel the principal to receive his money where they re&s;ide, with|out any compen&s;ation for their mi&s;conduct, although it be expre&s;sly agreed that he &s;hall receive it el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P N="20"><PB N="108" REF="034220_0108_0FFECB8D38F09D48">
XX. The only ca&s;es in which a factor can be liable for the whole price of the goods, are, where he has &s;old contrary to his in&s;truc|tions, or where he has received the whole property, or it has been lo&s;t by his default, &s;uch as relea&s;ing the debt to the purcha&s;ers, or neglecting to pro&s;ecute for it when due; but even here, he would be permitted to go into circum&s;tances, to induce the jury to give other and le&s;s damages; at any rate the fac|tor would be liable for the real value of the goods only, not for any nominal or ideal va|lue at which they might have &s;old on credit, or by deception. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, it is not pretended that any part of the property or its price has been lo&s;t by our default, but only that the defendant has been injured by not receiving the proceeds of it, after certain re&s;ervations, in Europe. Suppo&s;e the&s;e pro|ceeds, after the re&s;ervations mentioned, had only amounted to one hundred dollars, and it will be &s;hewn pre&s;ently that they did not amount even to that &s;um, will this honorable court &s;ay, that it is po&s;&s;ible any man by re|fu&s;ing to give another a power to receive one hundred dollars in Europe could injure the latter to the amount of fifty thou&s;and pounds, or &s;ub&s;titute him&s;elf to the per&s;on who was to pay that &s;um? This would be &s;aying in other words, that forty pounds in Europe, are worth fifty thou&s;and in this country. This would be turning a &s;pecial action on the ca&s;e, into a penal one; it would be inflicting a fine by way of puni&s;hment on the defend|ant, in&s;tead of compen&s;ating the plaintiff for the <HI>real injury</HI> which he might have receiv|ed. The truth is, it matters not in what
<PB N="109" REF="034220_0109_0FFECB8F4C271D50">
country money is to be paid, the party fail|ing, wherever he be &s;ued, mu&s;t pay the &s;um only with intere&s;t. Bills of exchange alone form an exception.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. It was &s;aid on the trial, that the de|fault of the plaintiffs extended to the whole &s;ubject, and that therefore there could be no other criterion of damages than the value of the whole property. This is not ju&s;t as an argument: in point of fact it is untrue, and directly again&s;t the record. It is not correct rea&s;oning, becau&s;e a default may often take place as to the whole &s;ubject, and yet the factor not be liable for the whole &s;um. If an in&s;urance broker is directed to make in&s;u|rance on property for one hundred thou&s;and dollars, and neglects &s;o to do, he is certainly re&s;pon&s;ible, but for what? If the ve&s;&s;el arriv|ed &s;afe, he would be liable for nothing; if lo&s;t he would be liable only for the <HI>actual value</HI> of the property. Other ca&s;es will be men|tioned in the argument.</P>
<P>But it is untrue in point of fact, that the default here extended to the whole &s;ubject. The plaintiffs are &s;ued for not giving the de|fendant an authority to receive in Europe the <HI>proceeds</HI> of the cargo, after keeping at their di&s;po&s;al a &s;um &s;ufficient to pay and guarantee them again&s;t certain claims. To the&s;e <HI>proceeds</HI> then, after the re&s;ervation, and no farther, did the default extend.</P>
<P>Admitting however for a moment, that the agents in this ca&s;e became liable for the whole amount of the <HI>&s;ubject.</HI> By the &s;ub|ject
<PB N="110" REF="034220_0110_0FFECB915AECBEF8">
mu&s;t be meant that preci&s;e object, to which the authorization related. What was that? The authority demanded was "to re|ceive whatever &s;um &s;hall remain of the pro|ceeds of the goods &s;old," after deducting certain &s;ums. The plaintiffs refu&s;e this au|thority. What then is the <HI>&s;ubject?</HI> Certain|ly the <HI>proceeds</HI> in Europe, and not the a|mount of the notes. Neverthele&s;s the court did not require the defendant, and refu&s;ed to permit the plaintiffs to prove what the a|mount of tho&s;e proceeds were. To &s;hew that this argument is correct, let us &s;uppo&s;e that the authorization had been given; the de|fendant admits that in &s;uch ca&s;e he could only have been entitled to receive by it in Europe the balance of <HI>the proceeds,</HI> after de|ducting certain &s;ums. Withholding the au|thorization, was therefore in effect only with|holding that balance, what ever it was.&mdash; Hence it is clear, that to receive the <HI>balance of the proceeds</HI> in Europe, was the <HI>&s;ubject</HI> of the demand, and of the refu&s;al. This was the <HI>&s;ubject</HI> of the controver&s;y, and the &s;ubject for which the plaintiffs were liable, if for any thing. What the amount was, does not ap|pear. It will be remembered, the plaintiffs offered, but were not permitted to &s;hew it; a tolerable e&s;timate however may be formed.</P>
<P>Gomez, when at Hamburgh, expected to lo&s;e <HI>&s;ixty</HI> per cent. All agree the markets were bad, and the &s;peculation ruinous.

15th June, 1795, were &pound;28718 17 3. Thus then the proceeds, if any there were, fell &s;hort of what the defendant was willing to leave at our di&s;po&s;al, the &s;um of &pound;10131 17 3. Where then were the monies which the defendant was to have received? How is the plaintiffs' default as to the whole &s;ub|ject made out, when it applied, if at all, to an object which had no exi&s;tence.</P>
<P N="22">XXII. It was al&s;o contended on the trial, that the price of the property being fixed and a&s;certained, every other mea&s;ure of da|mage was <HI>uncertain,</HI> and liable to difficulty. But are not damages <HI>uncertain</HI> in their ve|ry nature? Why are a jury &s;ummoned, but to render them <HI>certain?</HI> Is not this the ca&s;e in actions of covenant, trover, detinue, &s;lan|der, a&s;&s;ault and battery, and in every &s;pecial action on the ca&s;e? If in all the&s;e, damages are uncertain, why &s;hould a <HI>certain mea&s;ure,</HI> never before heard of, be applied to this ca&s;e? Even if the factors had &s;old of <HI>their own head,</HI> the price of the property would not form a <HI>certain</HI> mea&s;ure of damage. It might not be worth as much as it &s;old for, and other cir|cum&s;tances of mitigation would be li&s;tened to. How comes it, that the defendant's coun&s;el have not &s;tated in his declaration, that by rea&s;on of their default, the plaintiffs <Q>became liable and a&s;&s;umed to pay to the defendant the amount of the notes</Q>? The truth is, &s;uch an extravagant idea never oc|curred to them. With all their talents, they did not dare to hazard a declaration in &s;uch form; and yet &s;uch a declaration would have been good, or this judgment mu&s;t be bad.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="034220_0112_0FFECB95802143A0">
Notwith&s;tanding all this pretended uncer|tainty, which is always more or le&s;s the ca&s;e, never did an ea&s;ier or more familiar mea&s;ure for a&s;certaining damages pre&s;ent it&s;elf than in this ca&s;e. The plaintiffs refu&s;e to give the defendant an order to receive the <HI>pro|ceeds</HI> of certain property in Europe. Where then lays the difficulty of a&s;certaining their amount? They either exi&s;t or do not; if they do not, there could be no injury; if they did, their amount might ea&s;ily be known; the plaintiffs offered to a&s;certain it. This &s;um, with intere&s;t, after large deductions, &s;hould have been the utmo&s;t extent of the recovery.</P>
<P N="23">XXIII. From the rea&s;oning in the la&s;t ar|ticle, it al&s;o appears, that the &s;upreme court did wrong in rejecting the te&s;timony offered by the plaintiffs, to &s;hew there was no <HI>&s;pecial</HI> damage. In actions on the ca&s;e, every cir|cum&s;tance which can a&s;&s;i&s;t the jury in form|ing an e&s;timate of the extent and nature of the injury, ought to be admitted. The ac|tion is with propriety termed <HI>a &s;pecial action on the ca&s;e;</HI> that is, the plaintiff is to recover according to all the circum&s;tances of his ca&s;e. If the wrong he complains of has been at|tended with any injury, he recovers accord|ingly; if not he recovers nothing, or only nominal damages. Thus in actions <HI>on the ca&s;e,</HI> for e&s;capes again&s;t &s;heriffs, and for mi&s;|conduct in attornies, they are not bound, the &s;heriffs, to pay the whole &s;um due to the plaintiff in the original &s;uit, nor the attorney, the whole &s;um due to his client. This will be exemplified by &s;everal very &s;trong ca&s;es. The court on &s;uch occations, after the default
<PB N="113" REF="034220_0113_0FFECB9789435680">
is e&s;tabli&s;hed, permit the defendant to prove every circum&s;tance which may tend to &s;hew either that the party has not been injured at all, or to an incon&s;iderable degree. Yet all this was denied to the plaintiffs here: They are able, if permitted, and would have prov|ed, if their evidence had not been over-rul|ed, mo&s;t conclu&s;ively, that their refu&s;al to give the power in que&s;tion, had not only worked no injury to Mr. LeGuen but had proved beneficial to him.</P>
<P N="24">XXIV. Becau&s;e by rejecting the te&s;timo|ny, which is made the ground of the bill of exception, the court precluded the plaintiffs as factors, from every defence, which even the purcha&s;ers them&s;elves might have avail|ed them&s;elves of. A man is not always held to pay the price agreed upon: Thus the pur|cha&s;ers may, and no doubt will, in the action brought again&s;t them on their notes, endea|vor to prove, in avoidance of the contract al|together, that they were gro&s;sly deceived and impo&s;ed upon in the purcha&s;e of this cotton and indigo; that they were warranted of qualities very different from the truth. If they make out this proof, nothing is clearer than that they will be relieved again&s;t the payment of the&s;e notes; or that they will have to pay only the real value of the pro|perty. How iniquitous then may be the re|&s;ult? Gomez, Lopez and Rivera may have a verdict again&s;t the factors, on the ground of fraud or deception, and yet the latter may be compelled to pay the whole a|mount. If in both ca&s;es there be &s;pecial
<PB N="114" REF="034220_0114_0FFECB990E9EFF08">
verdicts, it is to be hoped they will be pub|li&s;hed together; they will reflect &s;ingular <HI>credit</HI> on the judicial annals of this country. If any fraud was practi&s;ed, as is contended by the purcha&s;ers, it was by the defendant him&s;elf, who negociated the &s;ale; yet as the notes are in the names of the agents, the re|lief will be again&s;t them: Thus may inno|cent factors be puni&s;hed for the fraud of their principal.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e of a hor&s;e which was &s;old for a barley corn, a nail doubling every nail, is well known; the animal at that rate came to 500 quarters of barley; the jury howev|er gave only eight pounds, which was his real value. Yet if the &s;ale had been made by the intervention of a factor, and he com|mits a &s;ingle mi&s;take or default, he mu&s;t pay the contract price, however exorbitant or uncon&s;cionable that may be. Thus if Mr. LeGuen had &s;old a &s;ingle hor&s;e, for as much as he was to have had for the cotton and in|digo, no one can doubt the purcha&s;er would have been relieved again&s;t &s;uch a hard bar|gain. Yet if the proceeds of the hor&s;e was to be paid in Europe, and his agent &s;hould refu&s;e him an order to receive the&s;e proceeds, which in all probability would not exceed one hundred guineas, nothing could exempt him, if this judgment be affirmed, from pay|ing to his principal the la&s;t farthing of the contract price. For aught that appears, the purcha&s;e of the cotton and indigo was almo&s;t as hard a bargain. To lo&s;e &pound;30,000, as may fairly be inferred from the verdict, the purcha&s;ers did, was no trifle.</P>
<P N="25"><PB N="115" REF="034220_0115_0FFECB9A926D1E08">
XXV. There is no evidence, nor is the fact found, that <Q>after certain deductions and re&s;ervations, there would remain due to the defendant, for the re&s;idue of the amount of the &s;aid notes a large &s;um of money,</Q> which is another material aver|ment in his declaration, and ought to have been proved. It is true, it is &s;tated there would be due a re&s;idue on the <HI>amount</HI> of the notes; but this, like &s;everal other allegations in the declaration, is inaccurate. The pur|cha&s;ers being only bound, as appears from the declaration and contract, to pay the notes as far as the proceeds extended, the defen|dant could not demand, nor they give a pow|er to receive any monies beyond the amount of the&s;e proceeds. It &s;hould therefore have been &s;tated, that <Q>there would remain due to the defendant in Europe, for the re&s;idue of the proceeds of the &s;aid cotton and in|digo, a large &s;um, &amp;c.</Q> of this we &s;ay there was no proof.</P>
<P N="26">XXVI. The con&s;ideration &s;tated in every declaration ought to be &s;ome certain act; matter or thing by which the defendant may be benefited, or the plaintiff incur &s;ome trou|ble or inconvenience, that is, either a dam|age to the plaintiff, or an advantage to the defendant. The declaration ought al&s;o to aver, that the plaintiff has on his part, ful|filled the terms on which the promi&s;e was made, or that he has offered to fulfil them, and &s;hewn that readine&s;s and willingne&s;s to do it which the law requires. To apply this law; the con&s;ideration &s;tated in the pre&s;ent declaration, is, that Gouverneur and Kem|ble
<PB N="116" REF="034220_0116_0FFECB9D25AB1100">
were to be allowed <Q>a commi&s;&s;ion of two and an half per cent. upon the amount of the &s;ales, and &s;uch other commi&s;&s;ion as the cour&s;e of their agency and the u&s;age of trade might entitle them to.</Q> But in no part of the declaration is it averred, that this commi&s;&s;ion was paid or tendered unto them, although it is evident from the decla|ration it&s;elf, that this payment was con&s;ider|ed by the defendant, as a condition prece|dent to his receiving the authority in que&s;|tion; nor is there any proof to &s;upply the want of this e&s;&s;ential averment.</P>
<P N="27">XXVII. Another very material and e&s;|&s;ential part of the defendant's declaration is not only without proof, but the te&s;timony and finding of the jury completely and en|tirely di&s;prove it. The declaration &s;tates, that the defendant reque&s;ted us <Q>to elect to receive the amount of the notes, or, at our option, &s;o much as would be due to him, after deducting and re&s;erving <HI>thereout</HI> cer|tain &s;ums at Havre, or at any other port in Europe, where the &s;hip &s;hould di&s;charge, <HI>out of the proceeds</HI> of the property; and af|ter <HI>&s;uch</HI> deduction and re&s;ervation <HI>made,</HI> to give to him power and authority to receive from the purcha&s;ers, the re&s;idue of the &s;aid notes out of the proceeds.</Q> It might be inferred from this, that no authority to re|ceive the re&s;idue was required until after this election was made, and Gomez, Lopez and Rivera had actually paid to us, or to our a|gent, the monies which were to be thus de|ducted and re&s;erved. The corre&s;pondence between the parties, all the propo&s;als of Mr.
<PB N="117" REF="034220_0117_0FFECB9FC2E34200">
LeGuen, the finding of the jury, and the &s;ev|eral times of making his demands of the au|thority in que&s;tion, evidently &s;hew, that the re&s;ervation to be made was not out of the proceeds when actually paid to our agent, but that this &s;um, which by the bye was nev|er a&s;certained between the parties, was to be left in the hands of the purcha&s;ers, &s;ubject to our order.</P>
<P>Mr. LeGuen's fir&s;t reque&s;t is to <Q>have an authorization to receive in France, the a|mount of the engagements of the purcha|&s;ers,</Q> without any re&s;ervation whatever to the plaintiffs. He next demands an au|thenticated copy of the contract, with an authority to receive, after payment of the freight, <HI>one hundred thou&s;and dollars.</HI> It would have been fortunate for all parties, if the property had produced only half of this &s;um. He la&s;tly demands an <HI>authenticated copy</HI> of the contract, with a complete authorization to receive whatever &s;um <HI>&s;hall remain of the proceeds of the goods</HI> (not of the <HI>amount of the notes,</HI> as artfully &s;tated in the declaration, and from which the proofs &s;o e&s;&s;entially va|ry) &s;old to Gomez, Lopez and Rivera, after deducting and re&s;erving at our di&s;po&s;al cer|tain &s;ums for our indemnification; nor is there any proof in the whole verdict, that he ever reque&s;ted us to make the election which he &s;tated in his declaration; although it a|bundantly appears, that the election to re|ceive the proceeds in Europe was made by us, and, for any thing that is found to the contrary, with effect.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="034220_0118_0FFECBA148186728">
Again&mdash;The time of making the reque&s;t explains the ideas of Mr. LeGuen. The la&s;t demand was only <HI>fifteen</HI> days after the de|parture of the White Fox. How could we make the election in &s;o &s;hort a time, before it was po&s;&s;ible it could be known where the property would be &s;old? Were we to &s;end to every port of Europe? It is plain then, that in&s;tead of our making an election pur&s;uant to the right re&s;erved to us, the defendant want|ed an authority and the contract, to pur&s;ue the purcha&s;ers and get the whole of the pro|perty from them. This appears farther, from the pains he has taken to e&s;tabli&s;h on record the cu&s;toms of Normandy. It is difficult to &s;ee any connection between the&s;e cu&s;toms and a power to receive the proceeds. It was the property he was in pur&s;uit of, and not a bal|ance of the proceeds. There is a material variance too between his declaration and his letter of the 15th June. In the former he &s;ays, he a&s;ked for an authority to receive <HI>im|mediately</HI> from Gomez, Lopez and Rivera; but in his letter he artfully demands a power to receive at the <HI>port of di&s;charge,</HI> without &s;ay|ing from whom; this variance we deem e&s;&s;en|tial and fatal. The court below were incon&s;i&s;t|ent in the admi&s;&s;ion of te&s;timony. The defend|ant was permitted to prove the cu&s;toms of Normandy, with a view no doubt of inducing the jury to believe he had been injured by not receiving the authority demanded, and yet we were not permitted to &s;hew any thing in mitigation. If the rule be ju&s;t, that we <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> the very in&s;tant the default if any took place, put our&s;elves into the &s;hoes of the purcha&s;ers, without the po&s;&s;ibility of protect|ing
<PB N="119" REF="034220_0119_0FFECBA2D6899F70">
our&s;elves again&s;t &s;uch an enormous pen|alty, and that the price of the article was the <HI>only</HI> rule of damage, the court &s;hould have excluded this te&s;timony altogether.</P>
<P>The court rejected the te&s;timony offered on our part, that no damage had been &s;u&s;|tained, on the ground, that the law in this ca&s;e having fixed the amount of the dama|ges to a <HI>preci&s;e definite &s;um,</HI> it could be nei|ther more nor le&s;s; it was therefore improp|er to receive evidence to &s;hew that a le&s;s, or any <HI>particular damage</HI> was &s;u&s;tained. They admitted this evidence on the part of the plaintiff, to &s;hew that he had &s;u&s;tained par|ticular damage, and refu&s;ed it to the defend|ants. The court have therefore certainly been in an error in admitting one, or refu&s;ing the other.</P>
<P>It is true the cu&s;tom of Normandy makes con&s;iderably in our favor, as it di&s;covers the defendant's true object, and the injury he contemplated doing to us, by taking the whole property under the pretence of a lien, into his own hands. We have a right how|ever to complain of its admi&s;&s;ion, as being directly contrary to the rule which the court inforced with re&s;pect to us. If circum&s;tan|ces of aggravation were admitted on the one &s;ide, &s;urely matters in mitigation ought to have been received on the other.</P>
<P N="28">XXVIII. That the rule of damage was er|roneous may be further illu&s;trated from ac|tions which are brought on contracts con|taining penalties. If it be an action of debt
<PB N="120" REF="034220_0120_0FFECBA4E4482988">
for the penalty, it might be &s;aid the party has a&s;certained the &s;um he is to pay for the breach of his contract, and that every other rule is <HI>uncertain.</HI> Yet every one knows that the <HI>actual damage</HI> &s;u&s;tained is all the plain|tiff can eventually recover, and that this mu&s;t be a&s;certained by a jury. Let us ad|mit as &s;trong a ca&s;e as can be put for the de|fendant&mdash;Suppo&s;e Gouverneur and Kemble immediately after making the &s;ale to Gomez, Lopez and Rivera, had covenanted under the penalty of fifty thou&s;and pounds to give him, in the cour&s;e of a week, authority to receive the proceeds in Europe, and that they had no demand whatever again&s;t him. They however refu&s;e, without a&s;&s;igning any rea&s;on whatever, to give &s;uch authority. In an ac|tion of debt for the penalty, or in an action of covenant, the penalty would be di&s;regard|ed and the rule of damage would be the <HI>in|jury actually</HI> &s;u&s;tained&mdash;that is the amount of the proceeds with intere&s;t. Shall they then be in a wor&s;e &s;ituation becau&s;e they did not comply with an implied promi&s;e, and refu&s;|ed to give an authority in a ca&s;e where, to &s;ay the lea&s;t, it was doubtful whether the de|fendant was entitled to receive one, and where they a&s;&s;igned at lea&s;t a plau&s;ible rea|&s;on for their refu&s;al, and could certainly not have complied, without very eminent hazard to them&s;elves?</P>
<P N="29">XXIX. The finding of the jury, as it re&s;|pects the damages, is illegal, and therefore the judgment ought to be rever&s;ed. In&s;tead of a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them as cu&s;tomary, they refer it to the court whether the contract price &s;hall
<PB N="121" REF="034220_0121_0FFECBA6F1DE1D00">
be the rule. If the court be of <HI>that</HI> opinion, then they find &s;uch a &s;um. While attaints were in force, &s;uch a verdict would not have been permitted, as the party mu&s;t have been deprived of his remedy again&s;t them for ex|ce&s;&s;ive damages&mdash;for no attaint would lie on a verdict, where the quantum of damage, as well as the law, were referred to the court. It is a dangerous innovation on e&s;tabli&s;hed precedents&mdash;a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing damages is emphatical|ly the duty of jurors. Referring it in this way to the court, if not a violation of tru&s;t, is de&s;troying tho&s;e barriers between the pro|vinces of courts and juries, in the pre&s;erva|tion of which, &s;eparate and di&s;tinct, con&s;i&s;ts the great excellence of this mode of trial.&mdash; This is at once &s;urrendering their prerogatives in which the party has an intere&s;t not to be defeated by pu&s;illanimity, or a mi&s;taken de|ference for the opinion of others. They are to enquire what injury the party has &s;u&s;tain|ed, not to leave the <HI>quantum</HI> to be determin|ed by the court. If jurors are thus permit|ted to evade adju&s;ting the very object for which they are convened, their attendance may as well be di&s;pen&s;ed with altogether, as an u&s;ele&s;s expence, and que&s;tions of <HI>damages</HI> as well as of law be at once &s;ubmitted to the court. If this honorable court &s;hall think the defendant entitled to recover, but that the jury have neglected, from a diffidence in their own judgment, to exerci&s;e that di&s;cre|tion re&s;pecting the damages, with which they are peculiarly intru&s;ted, they may, and no doubt will, order a <HI>venire facias de novo</HI> in or|der to admit further light, and to have the
<PB N="122" REF="034220_0122_0FFECBA901101458">
que&s;tion of damage definitively &s;ettled by the proper tribunal. It is much however in fa|vor of the plaintiffs that the jury have ex|pre&s;&s;ed no opinion <HI>again&s;t</HI> them either as to their liability, or to its extent. It would have been impo&s;&s;ible to induce a jury of mer|chants to &s;ub&s;cribe to &s;o dangerous a doctrine. It is a matter of public notoriety, and ought to be mentioned, that the fir&s;t jury who were &s;elected, from the mo&s;t re&s;pectable merchants in the community, determined, that Me&s;&s;rs. Gouverneur and Kemble had incurred no <HI>re&s;pon&s;ibility whatever.</HI></P>
<P>La&s;tly. The judgment ought to be re|ver&s;ed, becau&s;e it is an attempt to puni&s;h the plaintiffs for the in&s;olvency of the purcha|&s;ers, without a particle of proof that they have in any degree contributed to &s;uch in|&s;olvency. Although their failure is not &s;ta|ted on the record, it may fairly be inferred from the defendant's conduct. Why look to the plaintiffs for the <HI>contract price</HI> of the cotton and indigo, and that in &s;o <HI>que&s;tionable</HI> a form of action, if the purcha&s;ers were <HI>able</HI> and <HI>liable</HI> to pay? An action on their notes would be more certain and expeditious. The buyers mu&s;t then be either unable to pay, or have good rea&s;ons for re&s;i&s;ting payment. If their bankruptcy cannot be attributed to the plaintiffs, why &s;hould they become their &s;ub|&s;titutes? If the buyers have a defence, we ought in no event to be an&s;werable for any part. The defendant's motive to this &s;uit al&s;o appears from the time of its being bro't. If he really intended to recover <HI>damages</HI> for the <HI>actual injury</HI> &s;u&s;tained by our default,
<PB N="123" REF="034220_0123_0FFECBAA9871D000">
why not immediately abandon to us the whole property, and commence the action without delay? In&s;tead of this he waits more than a year to di&s;cover how the &s;peculation would terminate. If the i&s;&s;ue had been pro&s;|perous, and the buyers had &s;tood their ground, no recour&s;e would have been had to us; and yet our liability and its extent were preci&s;e|ly the &s;ame, whether the purcha&s;ers were a|ble to pay or not. It was a liability for the <HI>"di&s;a&s;trous con&s;equences,"</HI> as the defendant him&s;elf well expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>occa&s;ioned</HI> by our default, not a liability to pay the <HI>amount</HI> of the notes. This prepo&s;terous notion never occurred to him. Let him point out a <HI>&s;ingle di&s;a&s;trous con&s;equence</HI> occa&s;ioned by us, and we will compen&s;ate him an hundred &s;old.</P>
<P>After all that will or can be &s;aid on the &s;ubject, into what narrow limits may its real merits be compri&s;ed? It is a di&s;pute between a principal and his factors&mdash;The former com|plains of not being furni&s;hed with a power to receive the <HI>proceeds of certain property in Europe,</HI> or in other words certain monies.&mdash; The factors &s;ay: <Q>We have a lien on <HI>all</HI> your papers and on the price of your goods for our advances and re&s;pon&s;ibilities. This lien the law gave us the moment the &s;ale was made&mdash;as they are very con&s;iderable we only a&s;k you to <HI>&s;ecure</HI> us in this coun|try, and you &s;hall have every thing you want.</Q> This lien is not a chimera of the factors own brain. The principal him&s;elf admits it, but in&s;i&s;ts, that as the property was to be paid for in Europe, <HI>as far as the proceeds extended,</HI> the factors were bound to
<PB N="124" REF="034220_0124_0FFECBADBAF32FC0">
take payment there al&s;o, and to look to a por|tion of the&s;e proceeds, in the hands of the purcha&s;ers, for their indemnification. In &s;up|port of this perfectly novel idea of a <HI>qualified</HI> lien, the court are apprized that not a &s;ingle authority from any book will be produced. The principal's coun&s;el will rely upon nice and &s;ubtle di&s;tinctions, which &s;plendid talents will readily &s;ugge&s;t, and upon a train of rea|&s;oning &s;o refined as to require faculties, e|qual to their own, to be able fully to com|prehend. The factors, in oppo&s;ition to &s;uch a <HI>limited</HI> lien, a&s;&s;ert, <Q>That it is of no im|portance to them, upon what terms the principal &s;old his property, or where it was to be paid for. That the rights of factors are <HI>clearly</HI> defined by law&mdash;that they nev|er before heard, that &s;ome factors had one kind of lien&mdash;and others, a different one, or that the liens of factors vary according to the contract between them and the pur|cha&s;ers&mdash;but granting, &s;ay they, that our lien was thus re&s;tricted, and that we were bound to go to Europe for payment, we in|&s;i&s;t we had a right to keep the whole pro|perty under our controul, until actual &s;atis|faction in that country, and not to look on|ly to a remnant of it, which might be wa&s;t|ed by the purcha&s;ers, or wre&s;ted from them by the principal him&s;elf&mdash;If neither hap|pened, and the buyers by misfortunes, be|come in&s;olvent, our &s;ecurity will be much impaired, as in &s;uch ca&s;e our dividend on their e&s;tate would not pay our demand.</Q></P>
<P>On the que&s;tion of damages, the contro|ver&s;y is, if po&s;&s;ible, yet more &s;imple. The
<PB N="125" REF="034220_0125_0FFECBAF43CAB400">
principal brings his action for <HI>damages,</HI> or a <HI>compen&s;ation</HI> for an <HI>actual injury,</HI> which he alledges he has <HI>&s;u&s;tained</HI> by <HI>a breach of duty</HI> in his factors. The factors &s;ay, <Q>if we have been guilty of a breach of duty, it has been attended with no <HI>lo&s;s</HI> or <HI>damage what|ever</HI> to our employer, and that therefore he is not entitled to any <HI>recompence or e|quivalent whatever.</HI></Q> The principal, know|ing that he had &s;u&s;tained no lo&s;s, and of cour&s;e that he could not prove any, abandons the attempt (for his coun&s;el certainly had in view the nece&s;&s;ity of proving &s;pecial dam|age, when they drew the declaration) and in&s;i&s;ts upon our paying the whole &s;um which the purcha&s;ers had contracted to give. The factors, to this extravagant preten&s;ion, op|po&s;e this plain an&s;wer. <Q>If, &s;ay they, we er|red in not giving you an authority to re|ceive the&s;e proceeds, &s;urely <HI>their</HI> amount with intere&s;t, can be all which you are en|titled to from us. It matters not where your money was to be paid; if we were engaged by bond to pay you a certain &s;um on the royal exchange of London, and we fail, you can only, if you &s;ue us in Amer|ica, make us pay the &s;ame amount with intere&s;t here. Why then did you not &s;hew the amount of the&s;e proceeds? this would have been ea&s;y. One of the purcha&s;ers, and the very per&s;on who &s;old the proper|ty in Europe, was attending the trial. Nay, why did you not permit us to &s;hew their amount? What po&s;&s;ible rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned for your &s;olicitude to keep out of view the&s;e proceeds, other than that they were &s;o <HI>incon&s;iderable,</HI> that you wi&s;h|ed

the court and jury to be kept in igno|rance of them? For aught that appears on record, the property never was &s;old in Europe; if &s;o, how are you injured? Why &s;hould we take the place of the buyers? Did we guarantee their re&s;pon&s;ibility? Did you not &s;ell the property to them your&s;elves? If they have failed, who occa|&s;ioned their bankruptcy? Was it not bro't upon them by the extravagant price they were to give for the&s;e articles? If they have been ruined by no agency on our part, why are we to make good their en|gagements?

Is not the adver&s;e doctrine pregnant with ruin to every agent, and mi&s;chievous in the extreme?</P>
<P>To conclude. The court perceive they are to determine on a ca&s;e of no common magni|tude. They mu&s;t by this time be &s;atisfied, that it is not without rea&s;on the plaintiffs con&s;ider them&s;elves aggrieved, by the judg|ment from which they have appealed. In this honorable court they have no doubt the cau&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> be examined <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> every po&s;&s;ible <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, and determine <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> principles of law and ju&s;tice. The law ought to be very <HI>clear indeed</HI>
<PB N="127" REF="034220_0127_0FFECBB266417500">
with the defendant, to induce an affirmance of this judgment. If it be a ca&s;e which admits of a <HI>&s;ingle doubt,</HI> the judgment &s;hould be re|ver&s;ed, becau&s;e the defendant will &s;uffer no injury by it, ina&s;much as he will remain in <HI>&s;tatu quo,</HI> without any of his remedies again&s;t the purcha&s;ers being impaired. From them he will receive what he ought to have; whereas an injury, exten&s;ive and irreparable, will be done to the plaintiffs, in ca&s;e of af|firmance. They will have to pay an immen&s;e &s;um which has never come to their hands, and for which they have a remedy again&s;t <HI>no one.</HI> But if the law be clearly again&s;t them, they mu&s;t &s;ubmit. They appeal, however, with great confidence, to every profe&s;&s;ional gentleman pre&s;ent, whether they have ad|vanced any thing not warranted by the laws of their country. They appeal, with equal boldne&s;s, to every member who may have been engaged in commercial pur&s;uits, whe|ther their conduct has not been &s;trictly mer|cantile and con&s;onant to the known and e|&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;toms of trade. They appeal to every man of candor, probity and feeling, whether, if they have erred, they de&s;erve to have this heavy fine inflicted on them? They cannot yet believe they are to be con&s;igned to poverty and ruin; that an ample patrimo|ny, the produce of many years of hone&s;t in|du&s;try, is to pa&s;s from them to the defendant, to compen&s;ate him for an <HI>ideal injury;</HI> that they are to be puni&s;hed to the extent of an immen&s;e fortune, to make good a lo&s;s which the defendant has never &s;u&s;tained. They cannot per&s;uade them&s;elves that any mem|ber will think &s;uch a &s;entence legal or con|&s;cientious.
<PB N="128" REF="034220_0128_0FFECBB416B6B280">
In fine, they look with tru&s;t and confidence to the virtue and under&s;tanding of this high tribunal, for a deci&s;ion in their favor, and for that redre&s;s to which they humbly think them&s;elves entitled by the laws of their country, and the real and &s;ub&s;tantial merits of their ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Ca&s;e on the part of the defendant.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;e on the part of the de|fendant in er|ror.</NOTE> The coun&s;el for Louis LeGuen will urge and main|tain&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. That every contract made by a factor for the &s;ale of goods is for the benefit of his principal, and forms a contract between the principal and the purcha&s;er; and that every contract made by a factor for <HI>his own benefit,</HI> with the property of the principal, is a vio|lation of his duty, and a fraud again&s;t the principal.</P>
<P N="2">2. That every factor is bound generally to obey the orders of his principal, and particu|larly to u&s;e his endeavors to carry into effect any contract by him made for the benefit of his principal.</P>
<P N="3">3. That, therefore, if a contract &s;hould &s;tip|ulate an advantage, to depend on an election to be made, that election being it&s;elf a privi|lege or benefit, is to be exerci&s;ed for the prin|cipal, and is &s;ubject to his controul and direc|tion.</P>
<P N="4">4. That in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, the right of election to receive the purcha&s;e money in Eu|rope,
<PB N="129" REF="034220_0129_0FFECBB7F28C9CE0">
was a right which G. and K. ought to have exerci&s;ed for the benefit of their prin|cipal, according to his direction and reque&s;t, e&s;pecially as he was thereby to <HI>receive a pre|mium or advance of price of five per cent. e|qual to</HI> 6,12032/100 <HI>dollars.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. That this po&s;ition and inference are the more obvious in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e&mdash;Becau&s;e, the factors could neither have &s;tipulated nor exerci&s;ed &s;uch a right without the con&s;ent of their principal&mdash;Becau&s;e, the contract was made by the <HI>intervention and expre&s;s direction</HI> of LeGuen&mdash;Becau&s;e, <HI>it was his avowed ob|ject to tran&s;fer his property to France,</HI> of which country he was a native and citizen&mdash;Becau&s;e, at Havre-de-Grace, to which port the &s;hip was bound, he would have had a lien on the pro|perty, which would have enabled him to have taken precautions important to his &s;ecurity; and, becau&s;e it is ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e that all the&s;e advantages could be defeated, at the mere plea&s;ure of the factors, and in defiance of the direction of the principal.</P>
<P N="6">6. That the acknowledged lien, which a a factor has on the property entru&s;ted to him, for his advances and re&s;pon&s;ibilities, can form no objection to the demand of LeGuen in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e&mdash;Becau&s;e,</P>
<P>That lien, like every other right, is liable to be modified or aboli&s;hed, by the agreement of the parties, either expre&s;s or implied&mdash;</P>
<P>That it is not in its nature local, but de|pends wholly on the place of payment&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="034220_0130_0FFECBB977995A48">
That G. and K. by becoming parties to a contract for the benefit of LeGuen, contain|ing a right of election to receive in foreign parts the monies to ari&s;e from the proceeds, virtually agreed to give effect to this right, and to exerci&s;e his lien at the place of pay|ment&mdash;</P>
<P>That if payment had been po&s;itively &s;ti|pulated at Havre or Hamburgh, no doubt could have ari&s;en but that, after re&s;erving enough to cover their advances and re&s;pon|&s;ibilities, they would have been obliged to pay the overplus <HI>there</HI> to LeGuen; and in &s;uch ca&s;e, to have contended that they would have had a right <HI>to bring back the whole a|mount of the &s;ales to New-York at his expence and ri&s;k,</HI> to cover them&s;elves for a &s;um which might not amount to one <HI>thou&s;andth</HI> part of it, would be an ab&s;urdity too glaring to be endured&mdash;that a right of election to receive in a foreign port, brings the matter to the &s;ame i&s;&s;ue&mdash;when that election was made, the Foreign port became the place of payment, and <HI>there</HI> only could the lien of the factors be exerci&s;ed.</P>
<P>That it is an invariable maxim in law, that he who agrees to an <HI>end</HI> agrees to the MEANS. G. and K. might have refu&s;ed to enter into the contract on &s;uch terms, but having a&s;&s;ented, having executed the contract, they were bound not to impede the perform|ance of it.</P>
<P>That G. and K. could have given the au|thority required of them by LeGuen, in &s;o
<PB N="131" REF="034220_0131_0FFECBBB06045C08">
&s;pecial a form and with &s;uch co-operation of an agent named by them&s;elves, as would have &s;ecured to them the full benefit of their <HI>lien,</HI></P>
<P>And la&s;tly, it will be demon&s;trated that <HI>upon the con&s;truction contended for by G. and K. they and their agents may keep the whole property in their hands forever.</HI></P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the mea&s;ure and amount of damages, for the re&s;pondent, it will be con|tended,</P>
<P N="1">1. That the rules of law pre&s;cribe the mea|&s;ure of damages in all ca&s;es in which they are not merely contingent&mdash;Thus in promi&s;&s;ory notes and other liquidated demands, the le|gal intere&s;t&mdash;on foreign bills 20 per cent&mdash; on inland bills 5 per cent; without any enquiry into the &s;pecial damage which the party may have actually &s;u&s;tained. Thus in actions of trover, however &s;light the damage, the party is compelled to pay the whole value of the &s;ub|ject of which he hath made an improper u&s;e. Thus, finally, in every ca&s;e of a factor or tru&s;tee, the damages are invariably the whole value of the property which may have been affected by his neglect or mi&s;conduct; as in a ca&s;e of acknowledged authority, if a factor be in|&s;tructed to &s;ell at a credit of thirty days, and he &s;ell at a credit of thirty-one, <HI>he is in&s;tant|ly liable for the value of the whole,</HI> although the purcha&s;er prove in&s;olvent within the thir|ty days; becau&s;e a violation of his duty re|lating <HI>to the whole.</HI> If he had &s;old <HI>a part</HI> on|ly, he would in like manner have been lia|ble for <HI>that part.</HI> So if a tru&s;tee be directed
<PB N="132" REF="034220_0132_0FFEC1C89CAA7870">
to put out money on real property, and lend it on per&s;onal &s;ecurity, however competent, be is in&s;tantly an&s;werable per&s;onally for the whole. No enquiry is made or would be al|lowed as to the actual or probable damage &s;u&s;tained; the factor and the tru&s;tee are deemed to have taken the re&s;pon&s;ibility up|on them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the application of this obvious principle is peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary in the pre|&s;ent ca&s;e, becau&s;e of the impo&s;&s;ibility of a&s;|certaining or calculating the events which may have affected the views and intere&s;t of the parties; that if LeGuen &s;hould prove on the one part that he could have made half a million of dollars by the receipt of his money in Havre, and by his pre&s;ence in aiding the &s;ales, could have al&s;o en&s;ured a profit to Go|mez and Co. and G. and K. on the other part &s;hould prove, that they had rea&s;on to believe that a better market could be had at Hamburgh&mdash;a court ought to pronounce, as has been done by the &s;upreme court, that all &s;uch <HI>proof</HI> would be irrelevant, and could tend only to introduce confu&s;ion and uncer|tainty; the only object of enquiry being, have G. and K. neglected or di&s;obeyed the orders of their principal? If &s;o, does their neglect or mi&s;conduct relate to the whole or a part only of the property; if to the whole, they are liable for the whole&mdash;if to a part, for that part only. No other evidence was admi&s;&s;ible to extingui&s;h or mitigate the dam|ages, but that the price in the &s;ale was fraud|ulent&mdash;that the property had been lo&s;t be|fore the default&mdash;that the principal had re|lea&s;ed
<PB N="133" REF="034220_0133_0FFECBBF2CEA1F88">
the whole or part, or had been wholly or partially compen&s;ated; <HI>neither of which points was in any &s;ort attempted to be proved.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. That a default, which gives a right of action, nece&s;&s;arily carries with it the rule of compen&s;ation or damages, as an incident, and which cannot therefore in any degree depend on future events and contingencies.</P>
<P N="4">4. That as the default in the pre&s;ent in|&s;tance related to the whole property, and de|feated the e&s;&s;ential part of the &s;ale, G. and K. thereby &s;ub&s;tituted them&s;elves to the pur|cha&s;ers, and took upon them&s;elves the ri&s;k of future contingencies: That the amount for which the property &s;old is the proper and on|ly &s;tandard of value and of damages; and that on any other principle there could be <HI>no rule</HI> of damage in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e; the e|vents which took place &s;ub&s;equently to the default offering only a field for vague and unlimited conjecture.</P>
<P N="5">5. That in the ca&s;es mentioned under the fir&s;t head, and in many others, the law fixes the rule of damages, which will regulate and control the verdict of a jury&mdash;That when the parties agree the value, this value is the rule&mdash;That where an agent, by his a&s;&s;ump|tion or default puts him&s;elf in the place of another, with whom he has &s;ettled the value, the value &s;o &s;ettled &s;hall govern as again&s;t him.</P>
<P N="6">6. That con&s;equently the amount for which the goods were &s;old to Gomez, Lopez and Ri|vera,
<PB N="134" REF="034220_0134_0FFECBC0CE33D570">
together with five per cent. for receiv|ing in Europe, is the <HI>principal &s;um</HI> for which G. and K. became liable, for their default.</P>
<P>The foregoing general propo&s;itions will be illu&s;trated by arguments and analogies, which it is hoped will fully evince their &s;oundne&s;s, and the propriety of the judgment of the &s;u|preme court.</P>
<P>The objections in point of form, with which G. and K. may attempt to embarra&s;s the cau&s;e, would not be worthy of notice in this &s;tate of the bu&s;ine&s;s, even if they could, be anticipa|ted. They will, without difficulty, be di&s;po|&s;ed of in the cou&s;e of the argument.</P>
