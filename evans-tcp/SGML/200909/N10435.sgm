<P>Now we be&s;eech you brethren by the coming of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and by our gathering together unto him, that ye be not &s;oon &s;haken in mind, or be trou|bled, neither by &s;pirit, nor by word, nor by letter, as from us, as that the day of Chri&s;t is at hand.</P>
<P>Let no man deceive you by any means; for that day &s;hall not come except there come a falling away fir&s;t, and that man of &s;in be revealed, the &s;on of perdi|tion: Who oppo&s;eth, and exalteth him&s;elf above all that is called God, or that is wor&s;hipped; &s;o that He as God, &s;itteth in the temple of God, &s;hewing him&s;elf that He is God.</P>
<P>And then &s;hall that wicked be revealed, whom the Lord &s;hall con&s;ume with the &s;pirit of his mouth, and &s;hall de&s;troy with the brightne&s;s of his coming. Even him, who&s;e coming is after the working of Satan, with all power, and &s;igns, and lying wonders, and with all deceiveablene&s;s of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s in them that pe|ri&s;h, becau&s;e they received not the love of the truth that they might be &s;aved.</P></Q>

<P>THE Romi&s;h &s;uper&s;tition, con&s;idered in its &s;tructure, and the progre&s;s it has made in the world, is at once a &s;ur|pri&s;ing monument of human &s;agacity and weakne&s;s.</P>

ADVANCING by &s;low degrees to that fatal maturity it acquired before the refor|mation, it was nurtured by the ob&s;ervation and experience of ages, and the abilities of a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of as deep politicians as perhaps the world ever produced. It di&s;|covers a thorough acquaintance with the frailty of the human mind: Its pomp and pageantry &s;trike the &s;en&s;es: It manages with uncommon art and addre&s;s, every ob|ject that can touch the pa&s;&s;ions; and while it flatters the corrupt inclinations of the heart, it is at the &s;ame time covered with a glare of devotion and au&s;terity, and &s;upported with a &s;ophi&s;try, extremly adapt|ed to dazzle and mi&s;lead the under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>LONG before <HI>Luther</HI> appeared, it had extended it&s;elf over the whole face of the Chri&s;tian world: It had grown venerable by age: It had acquired a&s;toni&s;hing &s;trength by its long prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the minds of men: It had broken and nearly extingui&s;hed, what it had mo&s;t to dread, a liberal &s;pirit of enquiry: To conceal its own oppo&s;ition to the model upon which it profe&s;&s;ed to form it&s;elf, it had art|fully withdrawn the &s;acred &s;criptures from common view: It had clo&s;ely interwoven it&s;elf with the con&s;titution of &s;tates and kingdoms; and under a pretence of aid|ing,
<PB N="7" REF="013228_0005_0F90430FC3C95470">had &s;trangely gained an a&s;cendancy over the civil power, for which it &s;oon plead|ed a divine authority. While therefore we may ju&s;tly wonder that &s;o much of it re|mains in this enlightened age, we are at the &s;ame time obliged to acknowledge and adore a particular interpo&s;ition of divine providence, in the re&s;cue of &s;o many coun|tries, from a &s;pecies of fal&s;e religion, re|markable for the deep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion it takes of the minds of tho&s;e who have once been devoted to it.</P>
<P>POPERY, like other oppre&s;&s;ive powers, grew too confident of its own &s;trength, and pre&s;umed too much upon the igno|rance and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive temper of tho&s;e whom it had &s;ubjected. Having long practi&s;ed, with amazing &s;ucce&s;s, upon the credulity and weakne&s;s of mankind, it at length pu&s;hed the experiment too far. Contrary to that &s;pirit of di&s;&s;imulation and &s;ubtilty by which it had been generally guided, it neglected to varni&s;h its avarice, and venal di&s;pen&s;ations for licentiou&s;ne&s;s, with the colour of prudence and &s;obriety. The &s;ale of indulgences at the beginning of the &s;ix|teenth century, was conducted in a manner that &s;hocked the gro&s;&s;e&s;t under&s;tanding, and offended the con&s;ciences even of tho&s;e who had implicitly re&s;igned them to the
<PB N="8" REF="013228_0006_0F90431078D11EC8">direction of the church, and had never en|tertained very rigid &s;entiments of morality.</P>
<P>THIS rou&s;ed the great &s;pirit of <HI>Luther,</HI> and prepared the minds of men to li&s;ten to his di&s;cour&s;es, and adopt his free and noble &s;entiments, as they gradually open|ed and enlarged them&s;elves.</P>
<P>HAPPILY for the cau&s;e of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s, the tenth <HI>Leo,</HI> though care|le&s;s of the reputation of the church for &s;anctity and morals, was a friend and pat|ron of the liberal arts. Protected and &s;o&s;tered by him, they were eagerly &s;eiz|ed by the reformers, and employed by them with happy advantage in effecting one of the mo&s;t important and glorious revo|lutions the Chri&s;tian church ever &s;aw. The human mind, awakened from its lethar|gy, and engaged in the pur&s;uit of religious truth, felt an unu&s;ual plea&s;ure in the free exertion of its own faculties, and pu&s;hed its enquiries from one &s;ubject to another with &s;urpri&s;ing avidity and &s;ucce&s;s. The &s;criptures being laid open, and the expla|nation of them greatly aided by the revi|val of the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> learning, it &s;oon appeared how contrary the di&s;tin|gui&s;hing doctrines of <HI>Popery</HI> were, to tho&s;e delivered by Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles; and
<PB N="9" REF="013228_0007_0F90431161ADF2C0">how exactly the church of <HI>Rome,</HI> that had &s;o long been revered as <HI>the pillar and ground of truth,</HI> re&s;embled that apo&s;tate and idolatrous, that &s;ubtil and fraudful, that tyrannical and per&s;ecuting power, predict|ed in our text, and in other pa&s;&s;ages of the new-te&s;tament.</P>
<P>WITH this re&s;emblance, the reformers and their followers were greatly &s;truck, and finding the event &s;o plainly corre&s;|ponding to the prophecy, not only their faith was hereby confirmed in the &s;acred writings, as a revelation from him <HI>who alone declareth the end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done;</HI> but their confidence in the truth and goodne&s;s of their cau&s;e was &s;trengthened, and their hone&s;t zeal and ambition enlivened, to &s;eparate them&s;elves from a religious community that had &s;o gro&s;sly departed from the doctrine and pre|cepts of <HI>Je&s;us;</HI> to oppo&s;e its corruptions with the <HI>armor of light;</HI> and to be ho|noured as in&s;truments in the hand of divine providence, of delivering mankind from a &s;y&s;tem of fal&s;e religion, which the pro|phetic &s;pirit it&s;elf had de&s;cribed and exe|crated as a <HI>child of perdition.</HI></P>
<P>UPON this ground they boldly with&s;tood the exorbitant and impious demands of
<PB N="10" REF="013228_0008_0F9043142A0F1AE8">the chair of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> which had long been regarded as the centre of unity, and infallible in its dictates: Upon this ground they &s;upported them&s;elves again&s;t the charge of &s;ci&s;m, a charge which in that day carried a dreadful &s;ound to the ears of men, and which the papal power had em|ployed every artifice, every &s;pecies of per&s;ecution and cruelty, to render for|midable.</P>
<P>THE argument was indeed popular, and had great effect: The &s;ound of <HI>antichri&s;t,</HI> and the <HI>Man of Sin,</HI> mu&s;t have heightened an abhorrence of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Rome.</HI> But the reformers did not invent it; they found it prepared for them by the &s;pirit of truth; and they urged it with a manly boldne&s;s and energy, for which they will long be honoured in the church of God. That it was not the extravagance of en|thu&s;ia&s;m, not the artifice of a party heat|ed by controver&s;y, and exa&s;perated by in|juries, to &s;upport its own cau&s;e, but the re&s;ult of a &s;ober, though free enquiry into the &s;acred writings, has been confirmed by the judgment of the mo&s;t learned and temperate expo&s;itors from that day to the pre&s;ent; and mu&s;t be evident to every one who impartially con&s;iders what the&s;e writ|ings have delivered to us upon this point,
<PB N="11" REF="013228_0009_0F904314550C8CC0">and e&s;pecially the pa&s;&s;age of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> which I have now read. A &s;ubject that very properly comes under our pre&s;ent con&s;ide|ration, as it has been particularly pointed out by the honourable founder of this Lec|ture; who, in an in&s;titution that will tran&s;|mit his name to po&s;terity as a warm and generous friend to prote&s;tant piety, and the rights of con&s;cience, has expre&s;&s;ed his will, that the bu&s;ine&s;s of the third di&s;cour&s;e up|on this occa&s;ion &s;hould be <Q>for the detect|ing and expo&s;ing the idolatry of the Romi&s;h church; their tyranny, u&s;urpa|tion, fatal errors, abominable &s;uper&s;ti|tions, and other crying wickedne&s;&s;es in their high places; and finally, to prove that the church of <HI>Rome</HI> is that my&s;tical <HI>Babylon,</HI> that MAN OF SIN, that apo&s;|&s;tate church, &s;poken of in the <HI>New-Te&s;tament.</HI></Q></P>
<P>No one will a&s;&s;ert that prophe&s;y, or a prediction of things to come, which depend upon what are to us contingencies, is im|po&s;&s;ible. To man indeed, futurity is veil|ed, or at be&s;t, the object of uncertain con|jecture; but to the eye of God <HI>all things are naked and open.</HI> He may then, in what manner, and to what degree he plea&s;|es, foretell future events. Nor is there in rea&s;on, any pre&s;umption again&s;t his doing
<PB N="12" REF="013228_0010_0F904315A4F0A270">this, upon &s;pecial occa&s;ions, and for &s;ome important purpo&s;e. And when he does it, in a manner plainly beyond all human fore|&s;ight, and in a great compa&s;s and variety of connected in&s;tances, &s;uch a &s;cheme of prophecy, accompli&s;hed, authenticates it|&s;elf, and carries, in the very face of it, the mo&s;t genuine and convincing mark of its divine original and authority.</P>
<P>BE it allowed, that a bold conjecture may be fortunate, and the event &s;ometimes &s;urpri&s;ingly an&s;wer what was foretold at random, or upon the principles of human probability, or &s;ome pretended occult art. Let the prediction of <HI>Vettius Valens,</HI> the augur,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>From the twelve vultures that appeared to <HI>Romulus, Valens</HI> foretold that the &s;overeignty of <HI>Rome</HI> would la&s;t twelve hundred years.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Hurd</HI> cites another prediction, re&s;pecting what he calls <HI>a &s;till more important &s;ubject,</HI> in which every American is particularly intere&s;ted. "A Poet, &s;ays he, in the idea of pagani&s;m, was a Prophet too. And <HI>Seneca</HI> hath left us in proof of the in&s;piration to which, in his double capacity, he might pretend, the following Oracle,</P>
<LG>
<L>&mdash;Venient annis</L>
<L>Secula &s;eris, quibus Occanus</L>
<L>Vincula Rerum laxet, et ingens</L>
<L>Pateat Tellus, Typhi&s;que novos</L>
<L>Detegat Orbes; nec &s;it Terris</L>
<L>Ultima Thule.</L>
</LG>
<P><Q>This prediction was made in the reign of <HI>Nero;</HI> and for more than fourteen hundred years, might only pa&s;s for one of tho&s;e &s;allies of imagination, in which poetry &s;o much delights. But when at length, in the clo&s;e of the fifteenth century, the di&s;coveries of <HI>Columbus</HI> had realized this vi&s;ion; when that enterprizing navigator had forced the barriers of the va&s;t atlantic ocean; had <HI>loo&s;ened</HI> what the Poet calls <HI>the chain of things;</HI> and in the&s;e later ages, as was expre&s;sly &s;ignified, had &s;et at liberty an immen&s;e continent, &s;hut up before in &s;ur|rounding &s;eas from the commerce and acquaintance of our world: When this event I &s;ay, &s;o important and &s;o unexpected came to pa&s;s, it might almo&s;t &s;urpri&s;e one into a belief, that the prediction was &s;omething more than a poetical fancy; and that heaven had indeed re|vealed to one favoured <HI>Spaniard,</HI> what it had decreed, in due time, to accompli&s;h by another.</Q></P>
<P>The Dr. adds, <Q>The&s;e two in&s;tances of ca&s;ual conjec|ture, converted by time and accident into prophe&s;ies, I take for granted, are as remarkable as any other that can be alledged.</Q> <HI>Hurd's</HI> Sermons at the Lecture of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> p. 101.</P>
<P>The la&s;t is quoted by Dr. <HI>Samuel Mather,</HI> in his <HI>attempt to &s;hew that America mu&s;t be known to the Ancients.</HI> His re|mark upon it is, <Q>We need not be &s;o unrea&s;onably cre|dulous as to believe, that when <HI>Seneca</HI> wrote in this manner, he was in&s;pired with the &s;pirit of prophe&s;y; no; for nothing of this &s;ort appears. It is much more likely that either from &s;ome faint apprehen&s;ion of the &s;tructure of the terraqueous globe, or from &s;ome tradi|tional accounts of the greatne&s;s of the earth, and of <HI>another world</HI> be&s;ides their old one; he might write after this <HI>&s;eemingly prophetic</HI> manner.</Q></P></NOTE>, re&s;pecting the duration of the
<PB N="13" REF="013228_0011_0F904315CADF0520"><HI>Roman</HI> empire, be cited as an example. Should we grant that this was as remark|able in its accompli&s;hment as it is &s;aid to have been, and that more of the like kind might be produced; yet, what &s;ober man can &s;uppo&s;e, that a few &s;uch unconnected in&s;tances, re&s;pecting &s;eparate and unrelated events, in di&s;tant ages, can vie with or di|mini&s;h the credit and authoirty of the &s;crip|ture
<PB N="14" REF="013228_0012_0F9043167986EDC0">&s;y&s;tem of prophecy? A &s;y&s;tem va&s;tly exten&s;ive, and con&s;i&s;ting of a great variety of parts, all clo&s;ely combined in tendency and de&s;ign; &s;urpri&s;ingly various, and yet minutely particular in the events it fore|tells, which do all gravitate, &s;o to &s;peak, to one common centre: A prophetic &s;y&s;|tem, that has been gradually accompli&s;h|ing from the infancy of the world; that is ful&s;illing more and more every day, and increa&s;ing the evidence of its own divine original, and will do &s;o, till <HI>the my&s;tery of God &s;hall be fini&s;hed.</HI></P>
<P>IT has been in&s;inuated, not only with|out proof, but in direct oppo&s;ition to the te&s;timony of all hi&s;tory, that &s;ome &s;crip|ture predictions were framed after the events had happened, and are only hi&s;to|ries, antedated and tran&s;muted by pious fraud into the &s;hape of prophecies. But this cannot be pretended in the in&s;tance we are now con&s;idering. For as the ancient pre|dictions re&s;pecting Je&s;us Chri&s;t were in the hands of the <HI>Jews,</HI> his greate&s;t enemies, who pre&s;erved with religious care and ve|neration, what has long &s;ince become the monument of their own blindne&s;s, and ob|&s;tinate infidelity; &s;o the prophecies of the new-te&s;tament, concerning the apo&s;tacy of the church of <HI>Rome,</HI> have been for many
<PB N="15" REF="013228_0013_0F904317DA7456C0">ages in the cu&s;tody of that church (a very &s;trict cu&s;tody indeed) and with all their policy, &s;o infatuated have they been, as that with the&s;e predictions in their hands, the divine authority of which they zeal|ou&s;ly maintain, they have yet been gradu|ally fulfilling them, and proving their own eccle&s;ia&s;tical polity, to be that very <HI>my&s;|tery of iniquity</HI> there de&s;cribed, and de|voted to de&s;truction.</P>
<P>LET it be further ob&s;erved, that though we e&s;teem the argument from prophecy, to be &s;olid and convincing, and a good ad|ditional one, again&s;t the church of <HI>Rome;</HI> yet it is only one, among many; and not &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the Prote&s;tant cau&s;e, as that upon &s;uppo&s;ition it &s;hould fail, and be giv|en up, that cau&s;e mu&s;t fall with it. The main arguments again&s;t the corruptions of Popery, ari&s;e from their own intrin&s;ic ab&s;ur|dity, and direct oppo&s;ition to the fir&s;t noti|ces of the human mind in a religious enqui|ry; from the unprophetic and didactic part of holy writ; from the plain doctrines and precepts of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and from the genius and &s;pirit with which the whole go&s;pel is animated and di&s;tingui&s;hed. Not only doth &s;cripture condemn, but rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e reclaim, again&s;t the di&s;tingui&s;hing tenets and practices of the
<PB N="16" REF="013228_0014_0F904317FB292C10">church of <HI>Rome;</HI> and again&s;t that arrogant and lordly, that intolerant and cruel, that delu&s;ive and worldly &s;pirit, that guides her deci&s;ions, directs her conduct, and breathes through the whole pompous exterior of her religious offices and rites. So that we have enough to &s;atisfy us, without recur|ring to prophecy, that Popery is in the true and proper &s;en&s;e, <HI>antichri&s;tian.</HI></P>
<P>YET, when we behold with wonder this &s;y&s;tem of fal&s;hood and iniquity, and that divine providence &s;hould permit it to lift its head &s;o high, and to obtain &s;o wide and la&s;ting an e&s;tabli&s;hment, in the vi&s;ible kingdom of God; does it not relieve our minds, and &s;upport our con&s;tancy to the truth, to con&s;ider, that all this was not unfore&s;een by the true head of the church; that it was permitted by him for wi&s;e and holy purpo&s;es; that it was foretold, and the church early warned of it by the &s;pirit of truth; and that the &s;ame &s;pirit hath a&s;|&s;ured us, this grand delu&s;ion &s;hall in due time pa&s;s away, and like the "ba&s;ele&s;s fabric of a vi&s;ion, leave not a wreck be|hind."</P>
<P>I AM aware indeed, that in the cata|logue of learned authors, who con&s;ider the

A particular account of the ground of this di&s;&s;ent, on the one &s;ide, and what has been offered on the other, by the much larger number of equally great and unbia&s;&s;ed men, cannot be expected in a &s;ingle di&s;|cour&s;e<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See, Mede, Poole, Whithy, Ben&s;on, Bi&s;hop, Newton, Hurd, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>GROTIUS, &s;uppo&s;es this prophecy to refer to the time preceding the de&s;truc|tion of the temple at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and that the <HI>Man of Sin,</HI> was the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperor <HI>Caligula:</HI> And not being able to make out the re&s;emblance, between this Emper|or and the &s;ub&s;equent part of the de&s;crip|tion, he is obliged to introduce <HI>Simon Ma|gus,</HI> as that wicked one who was to come <HI>with &s;igns and lying wonders.</HI> But <HI>Gro|tius,</HI> who&s;e parts and learning are every where confe&s;&s;ed, carried his candor to an exce&s;s. He was deeply engaged in a plan, which almo&s;t every one but him&s;elf con&s;i|dered as vain and impracticable, for ac|commodating the difference between the Prote&s;tant and Popi&s;h communion: His
<PB N="18" REF="013228_0016_0F904319838513C8">hopes, however, upon this point, were for a good rea&s;on, flattered by &s;ome of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable per&s;onages on the papal &s;ide. This might give a bia&s;s even to the mind of &s;o great a man; and knowing that nothing was more offen&s;ive to the Pope and his adherents, than the applica|tion of the propheices concerning <HI>Antichri&s;t,</HI> and the <HI>Man of Sin</HI> to the papal chair, he might be led to employ his abilities to find out another meaning. However this may be, it &s;hews the &s;oundne&s;s of the common interpretation of this pa&s;&s;age, that even &s;uch abilities could oppo&s;e it with no greater advantage. For it is con|fe&s;&s;ed on all hands, that <HI>Grotius</HI> never fell &s;o much below him&s;elf as upon this ar|gument. The Romani&s;ts them&s;elves have tacitly acknowledged this, of whom it has been ob&s;erved, that while they have been fond of his name in this di&s;pute, they have never boa&s;ted of the &s;trength or &s;uc|ce&s;s of his arguments. In the opinion of the be&s;t chronologi&s;ts, the accompli&s;h|ment he contends for, was prior to the prophecy; for <HI>Caligula</HI> died before St. <HI>Paul</HI> wrote this epi&s;tle.</P>
<P>DR. <HI>Hammond,</HI> &s;uppo&s;es <HI>Simon Magus</HI> and the <HI>Gno&s;tics</HI> to be here de&s;cribed. Among the learned refuters of this &s;up|po&s;ition,

<PB N="20" REF="013228_0018_0F8FB4EB4CDE3468">grand oppo&s;er of Chri&s;t and his religion. But Antichri&s;t, &s;ay they, is a &s;ingle per&s;on, not a combination or &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of per&s;ons; his continuance upon earth will be very &s;hort: Adopting upon this occa&s;ion the prophetic period, <HI>a time, and times, and half a time,</HI> and taking it lite|rally, they limit the duration of Antichri&s;t to three years and an half. He will be revealed, they affirm, &s;ome time before the coming of our Lord at the la&s;t day; when the church will &s;eed the &s;ad effects of his &s;ubtilty and power; but, in their opinion, he has never yet made his appear|ance in the world.</P>
<P>This de&s;erves particular attention. It is an important confe&s;&s;ion from an adver|&s;ary; not from a &s;ingle writer upon this &s;ubject, but the be&s;t popi&s;h Doctors. <HI>Cal|met</HI> him&s;elf, in his di&s;&s;ertation upon Anti|chri&s;t, authori&s;es us to a&s;&s;ert this. They own then, that <HI>Antichri&s;t</HI> and the <HI>Man of Sin,</HI> are one and the &s;ame; they own that nothing has yet appeared in the world to fulfil the prophecies concerning this ini|quitous power. Is not this to confe&s;s, that all the expo&s;itors we have now mentioned, and others who have endeavoured to prove, that <HI>Simon Magus,</HI> the <HI>Gno&s;ticks,</HI> the re|volting <HI>Jews,</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, or

Strange indeed, that &s;o remarkable a power as the my&s;tery of of iniquity is repre&s;ented to be in the &s;acred writings, and which the Apo&s;tle expre&s;sly tells us began to work in his own day, &s;hould not in the cour&s;e of &s;eventeen hundred years, have grown to &s;uch a &s;ize as to be vi&s;ible &s;omewhere!

<P>How then, you may perhaps &s;ay, &s;hall we di&s;tingui&s;h truth from error upon &s;uch a &s;ubject, and amid&s;t &s;o many various and contradictory opinions of tho&s;e who have employed much time, and no &s;mall abili|ties, in the&s;e re&s;earches? But let us not be di&s;couraged: Difficulties excite atten|tion, and call forth the exertion of the human mind; and attention to &s;o noble a &s;ubject as the &s;acred writings will ever be well repaid. There is a portion of ob|&s;curity intermingled with the light of &s;cripture prophecies, before their accom|pli&s;hment, and even after this is con&s;ide|rably
<PB N="22" REF="013228_0020_0F90431BB4742190">advanced. We our&s;elves are able to a&s;&s;ign &s;ome good rea&s;ons for this; and there may be more, with which we are not acquainted. Even the doctrinal part of &s;cripture is not, in all its branches, &s;o plain, but that wi&s;e and good men have differed in their explanations of it; and can we wonder that this &s;hould take place with re&s;pect to the prophetic! If we do not drop our attention to the former up|pon this account, why &s;hould we to the latter. Are not the deci&s;ions of mere rea&s;on, in different per&s;ons, various and often oppo&s;ite upon the &s;ame &s;ubject? Mu&s;t we therefore turn &s;ceptics? Time matures our ob&s;ervations and rea&s;oning upon common &s;ubjects, and give us an in|crea&s;e of <HI>natural</HI> knowledge: Time re|wards our <HI>religious</HI> enquiries with a know|ledge more important: Time illuminates what was dark, and explains what was my&s;terious in the prophecies of holy writ. The &s;ucce&s;&s;ive labours of the learned and inqui&s;itive, upon this, as upon all other &s;ubjects, however they may differ in their proce&s;s and conclu&s;ions, have jointly con|tributed to enlarge the human under&s;tand|ing.</P>
<P>DR. <HI>Whitby,</HI> whom I have not yet mentioned, &s;o far agrees with <HI>Le'Clerc,</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="013228_0021_0F90431BEA46B160">as to &s;uppo&s;e this apo&s;tacy, or <HI>falling away,</HI> to intend the rebellion of the <HI>Jews</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Roman</HI> government; but then he includes in it al&s;o, the apo&s;tacy of ma|ny Jewi&s;h converts, from the chri&s;tian faith; and the <HI>Man of Sin,</HI> according to his explanation, is the body of the Jewi&s;h nation, <HI>the man of di&s;obedience, who will not &s;ubmit to law and government.</HI> He allows, however, this and other characters here given, to refer in part to the papal apo&s;tacy and u&s;urpation.

<P>THIS leads me to ob&s;erve, that there is doubtle&s;s, a double &s;en&s;e in many &s;crip|ture prophecies. By this double &s;en&s;e, I do not mean a &s;tudied and deceitful un|certainty in the expre&s;&s;ion, on purpo&s;e to &s;ecure the credit of the prediction, on which &s;ide &s;o ever the event may fall.</P>
<P>OF this kind was the an&s;wer of the ora|cle at <HI>Delphos</HI> to <HI>Crae&s;us:</HI> To <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> it was the &s;ame: So compleat was the am|biguity, that one would he&s;itate in deter|mining
<PB N="24" REF="013228_0022_0F8FB4ECB93CCD30">which was the mo&s;t natural con|&s;truction of the words, whether the <HI>Ro|mans</HI> &s;hould vanqui&s;h him, or he &s;hould vanqui&s;h the <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>SUCH was the ba&s;e duplicity of the an|cient Pagan oracles, which &s;ome, even of their own writers have not failed to com|plain of, and expo&s;e. But not an in&s;tance of this kind is to be found in the prophe|cies of &s;cripture. They do not indeed &s;peak of &s;ingle and unrelated events; they are a regular &s;y&s;tem, who&s;e parts relate to one another, and to one grand object; and when they predict an event, they of|ten do it in language that plainly ri&s;es above it, and looks further, and is after|wards found to be more fully accompli&s;h|ed in a &s;ub&s;equent one, &s;imilar indeed to the fir&s;t, but perhaps much more impor|tant. This is what I intend by a double &s;en&s;e: More events than one may corre&s;|pond to, and be intended by, the &s;ame pre|diction; events that have &s;ome general re|&s;emblance to each other, and refer to one grand de&s;ign, though they may differ in &s;ome circum&s;tances, and happen in di&s;tant ages.</P>
<P>THIS is undoubtedly true of the pro|phecies of holy writ; and &s;o far is it from
<PB N="25" REF="013228_0023_0F90431CB26A95F0">dimini&s;hing, that it rather increa&s;es their lu&s;tre and authority. They appear more plainly from this circum&s;tance to be a plan of prophecy not to be counterfeited; and to proceed from that divine fore&s;ight, to which all events in all ages, are at once open. This was the opinion of Lord <HI>Bacon.</HI> "In &s;orting the prophecies of &s;cripture with their events, we mu&s;t allow for that latitude which is agreeable and familiar to divine prophecies, being of the nature of their author, with whom <HI>a thou|&s;and years are but as one day:</HI> And there|fore they are not fulfilled punctually at once, but have &s;pringing and germinant accompli&s;hment throughout many ages, though the height or fullne&s;s of them may refer to &s;ome one age." Thus &s;peaks, that great man.</P>
<P>THERE is a general analogy that runs through the whole providence and moral government of <HI>God.</HI> One thing is often by its very nature the figure and type of another. The di&s;pen&s;ation of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was a ruder draught of that which the go&s;pel has e&s;tabli&s;hed; and the &s;tate of the Jewi&s;h, preluded in many circum&s;tances that of the Chri&s;tian church. And though the ancient prophecies might be partly fulfilled in that age, yet we cannot doubt that they
<PB N="26" REF="013228_0024_0F90431D3A2FA528">looked further, and have been more fully accompli&s;hed under the go&s;pel. In like manner, there is an analogy between the fir&s;t and &s;ucceeding ages of the chri&s;tian church; and though the predictions of our Saviour and his apo&s;tles might have a fir&s;t re&s;pect to events, in their own day, or not very di&s;tant from it, yet we have the be&s;t rea&s;on to conclude, that in many parts of them, they regarded di&s;tant ages, and will not have their full and ab&s;olute completion till <HI>the time of the re&s;titution of all things.</HI></P>
<P>UPON this principle, may we not in &s;ome mea&s;ure, reconcile the opinions of the learn|ed Prote&s;tant authors before mentioned, and even &s;ome of the Romi&s;h, with the truth of &s;cripture prophecy, and at the &s;ame time maintain the conclu&s;ion of by far the greater part of our own writers, that the papal Antichri&s;t is ultimately in|tended by the <HI>Man of Sin,</HI> and that no other power fully an&s;wers to all the cha|racters in this prophetic de&s;cription.</P>
<P>THE Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> expre&s;sly tells us, that there are <HI>many Antichri&s;ts.</HI> The&s;e are of different forms and &s;izes, and may appear in different ages, though all agree|ing in their oppo&s;ition to Je&s;us Chri&s;t and
<PB N="27" REF="013228_0025_0F8FB4EE19BA0F40">his kingdom. A number of them then may be &s;o con&s;iderable, as to be the &s;ub|ject of &s;cripture prophecy, and pointed out before hand by the &s;pirit of truth in this and other predictions, for the warn|ing and &s;upport of the faithful in different periods, though there may be one princi|pal Antichri&s;t, chiefly and ultimately intend|ed by the&s;e predictions, in which they do all evidently center and unite.</P>
<P>WE may grant then, that the <HI>Man of Sin,</HI> he that oppo&s;eth him&s;elf, and was in due time to be con&s;umed and de&s;troyed, does not exclu&s;ively intend the papal pow|er, but al&s;o other enemies to chri&s;tianity,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>"There is, &s;ays a late learned and judicious writer, a complex kind of prophecy, <HI>viz.</HI> when future per&s;ons and things in their natural characters and actions, are made emblems of per&s;ons and things more remote than them&s;elves, and are predicted with this very view, that they may re|pre&s;ent them. In this certainly there is nothing incon|gruous. Known unto God are all the actions of men from the beginning. Every event that comes to pa&s;s is the ef|fect of his providence. From the characters and actions therefore of per&s;ons, who he knew would come upon the &s;tage, he might ea&s;ily choo&s;e tho&s;e which in their nature and circum&s;tances, were be&s;t adapted to be emblematical repre&s;entations of the future per&s;ons and events to be in|troduced in more di&s;tant periods: And having fixed upon &s;uch as he &s;aw to be proper for that end, it was every way agreeable to his wi&s;dom to foretel them, in order that he might rai&s;e and keep up among mankind, an expectation of the more di&s;tant greater events. Indeed this method of prophecy is &s;o far from being ab&s;urd, that nothing can be conceived better adapted to di&s;play the perfections of God. For it gives us the grande&s;t, mo&s;t magnificent, and mo&s;t affecting idea of the power and fore-knowledge of God, and of the extent of his providence, whereby the world is governed."</P>

<P>THE Jewi&s;h nation as a body were ad|ver&s;aries to Chri&s;t, and per&s;ecutors of his followers: Tho&s;e of them that apo&s;tati&s;ed from the chri&s;tian faith were perhaps as fierce in this oppo&s;ition as any: Their San|hedrim and High Prie&s;t, who &s;at <HI>in the temple of God,</HI> were the leaders in this per|&s;ecution: They were for exalting them|&s;elves above the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, called

But the power and polity of this nation were &s;oon after, according to &s;cripture predictions, &s;ignally broken, by the coming of the Lord Je&s;us, to execute his judgments upon them.</P>
<P>SIMON MAGUS was a <HI>Man of Sin;</HI> he came with <HI>&s;igns and lying wonders;</HI> but with other &s;educers, and oppo&s;ers of the go&s;pel, who accompanied, or &s;oon follow|ed him, he has long &s;ince pa&s;&s;ed away.</P>
<P>THE Pagan Emperors employed their power to de&s;troy the religion of Je&s;us in its infancy, and &s;everely oppre&s;&s;ed and per|&s;ecuted his followers: But the go&s;pel, as had been foretold, prevailed; and at length the Empire, with <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> at its head, a&s;&s;umed the profe&s;&s;ion of chri&s;tianity. This was one remarkable coming of the &s;on of man, though clouded by the internal cor|ruptions of the church.</P>
<P>MAHOMET, was a <HI>Man of Sin,</HI> a fal&s;e prophet; who came with <HI>deceiveablene&s;s of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and induced many <HI>to believe a lie;</HI> a great and &s;ucce&s;sful oppo|&s;er of the go&s;pel by the &s;word. His &s;eat the Turki&s;h Empire, has for a long time,

<P>HOW far we may allow this prophetic de&s;cription of St. <HI>Paul</HI> to refer to the&s;e per&s;ons, and events, I leave, after what has been &s;aid, to the deci&s;ion of others: My principal de&s;ign being to &s;hew, that none of them do fully an&s;wer and ab&s;olve this prophecy; while in the Papal Anti|chri&s;t, all the characters &s;urpri&s;ingly center and unite.</P>
<P>THESE characters are, apo&s;tacy; a <HI>Man of Sin</HI> who <HI>&s;itteth in the temple of God;</HI> or in the church; who at the &s;ame time <HI>oppo&s;eth him&s;elf</HI> to Chri&s;t and his kingdom; who <HI>exalteth him&s;elf above all that is call|ed God,</HI> all civil rulers; who <HI>&s;heweth him|&s;elf that he is God,</HI> impiou&s;ly a&s;&s;uming the power and authoriry of the Almighty: who&s;e coming is <HI>after the working of Satan;</HI> with cruelty, &s;ubtilty, and unrighteous deceivings; <HI>with lying wonders</HI> and fal&s;e miracles.

<P><PB N="31" REF="013228_0029_0F8FB4EE2DA97FB8">
SOME of the&s;e characters do not agree to the body of the Jewi&s;h nation. They did not apo&s;tatize from chri&s;tianity, for they never a&s;&s;umed that profe&s;&s;ion: Tho&s;e who fell away from the go&s;pel, had no leader, and were ab&s;orbed in the much greater part of the nation, to which they returned. <HI>Simon</HI> the &s;on of <HI>Gioras</HI> was never exalted above the Emperor, but be|came his captive. Neither he, nor the High Prie&s;t, nor the Sanhedrim, much le&s;s the body of the nation, ever &s;at in the temple, and received homage <HI>as God;</HI> for the <HI>Jews</HI> in that age, with all their impieties and vices, had the greate&s;t ab|horrence of idolatry, and could not endure any approaches to it. The&s;e important circum&s;tances evidence, that the Jewi&s;h nation does not afford a compleat fulfil|ment of this prophecy.</P>
<P>NEITHER do <HI>Simon Magus,</HI> and the <HI>Gno&s;tics,</HI> as Dr. <HI>Whithy</HI> has largely and fully proved.

They did not pretend to the pow|er of working miracles; nor was their chair or &s;eat <HI>in the temple of God.</HI></P>
<P>MAHOMET was no apo&s;tate; for he ne|ver profe&s;&s;ed either the religion of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> or of <HI>Je&s;us.</HI> He never &s;at <HI>in the temple of God;</HI> for though he changed many

<P>As to the recrimination of the Papal writers again&s;t the Prote&s;tants upon this point; in order to &s;hew the ju&s;tice of it, they mu&s;t fir&s;t prove that the reformed churches have a <HI>Man of Sin</HI> at their head, to who&s;e &s;upremacy they pay an unlimited &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; that he &s;itteth in &s;ome capital temple <HI>as God;</HI> and that his cau&s;e has been promoted by pretended miracles: And finally, to prove the reformation an apo&s;tacy, they mu&s;t overthrow all the arguments brought by the reformed again&s;t the di&s;tingui&s;hing dogmas and rites of their own church; and evidence, that the&s;e are &s;upported by the authority of the new-te&s;tament.

HAVING thus &s;hewn, that none of the&s;e per&s;ons and events do fully an&s;wer to this prophecy; though in &s;everal of them there is &s;ome general and &s;trong re&s;em|blance of it; if now we can prove that all its characters are to be found in the Papal power, it mu&s;t &s;atisfy us, that this power was ultimately, and principally in|tended by it.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place, let it be ob&s;erved, that the Apo&s;tle's de&s;ign in the begining of this epi&s;tle, is to &s;hew, that <HI>the day of Chri&s;t,</HI> by which he plainly means, as has been abundantly proved by expo&s;itors, the final judgment, <HI>was not at hand,</HI> and &s;hould <HI>not come, except there come a fal|ling away fir&s;t; and that Man of Sin be re|vealed.</HI> By which he &s;trongly intimates, that the apo&s;tacy he principally meant &s;hould be extended to a di&s;tant time, and far beyond the de&s;truction of <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI></P>
<P>THIS apo&s;tacy is evidently a religious one; not a falling away from government, but from the purity of faith and wor&s;hip: It was to be effected by <HI>&s;trong delu&s;ions,</HI> and the <HI>deceiveablene&s;s of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> through which tho&s;e who <HI>had not the love of the truth,</HI> &s;hould be induced to <HI>believe a lie that they might be damned; having

<P>THE principal character in it; the lead|er, to whom the prophecy chiefly refers, is the <HI>Man of Sin:</HI> A &s;trong expre&s;&s;ion, indicating not only one who is very wicked him&s;elf, but eminently induces others to act wickedly.

It gives us a general cha|racter of that order of men, and of tho&s;e who have had the principal &s;hare in their eccle&s;ia&s;tical admini&s;tration; the chief pro|moters and defenders of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> apo&s;tacy.</P>
<P>THAT this application, &s;evere as it may &s;eem to be, is not unju&s;t, all hi&s;tory atte&s;ts. No man can read <HI>Platina</HI>'s lives of the Popes, and <HI>Bowers</HI>'s larger and more mo|dern hi&s;tory, without being &s;hocked at the impieties, the perfidy, and unbounded de|baucheries of tho&s;e who have &s;at in St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s chair; and without acknowledg|ing, that the&s;e, if any upon earth, were <HI>Men of Sin.</HI> Nor can we take even a cur&s;ory view of the Papal &s;y&s;tem of reli|gion; its direct oppo&s;ition to the honour
<PB N="36" REF="013228_0034_0F904324B9CB1310">of God and the one mediator; its gro&s;s &s;uper&s;tition and idolatries; its tendency to deba&s;e and en&s;lave the human mind; the indulgence it grants to vice in every form; and the pleas it allows for crimes, at which the untutored brea&s;t immediate|ly revolts; without acknowledging, that the contrivers of &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem, with the go&s;pel in their hands, mu&s;t have had an heart, to an uncommon degree in&s;en&s;ible and depraved.</P>
<P>ANOTHER character is, <HI>he oppo&s;eth:</HI> He is an adver&s;ary to Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his Kingdom. This directly an&s;wers to the name <HI>Antichri&s;t,</HI> and indicates the head of the Romi&s;h church to be the principal <HI>An|tichri&s;t,</HI> &s;poken of by St. <HI>John;</HI> which may &s;ignify, both one who places him&s;elf in the room of Chri&s;t, and acts in oppo&s;ition to him. The Pope calls him&s;elf the vicar of Chri&s;t; the only vi&s;ible head of the church; and bla&s;phemou&s;ly arrogates to him&s;elf the infallibility and &s;upremacy of our a&s;cended Lord. Under the pretence of &s;erving him, he &s;teps into his place; and there corrupts the &s;implicity, defiles the purity, and oppo&s;es the true power and &s;pirit of his religion. This <HI>Son of perdition,</HI> the very phra&s;e by which our Lord de&s;cribes <HI>Judas,</HI> betrays his ma&s;ter
<PB N="37" REF="013228_0035_0F9043261C330A38">with a ki&s;s, and &s;ells him for &s;ilver; de|ba&s;ing his doctrine and wor&s;hip for the <HI>gain of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>HE oppo&s;es with fiercene&s;s, as well as &s;ubtilty and deceit. <HI>He maketh war with Saints,</HI> and proves him&s;elf to be that cruel and oppre&s;&s;ive power, predicted by <HI>Daniel,</HI> and afterwards in the revelations of St. <HI>John,</HI> which <HI>hath horns like a Lamb,</HI> but at the &s;ame time, <HI>&s;peaketh like a Dragon.</HI></P>
<P>How mild his appearance, how gentle his language, upon &s;ome occa&s;ions! But how dreadful his power! How relentle&s;s his cruelty! Speak, ye holy &s;ouls, for you can tell! Ye martyrs, and confe&s;&s;ors! Who, becau&s;e you would not violate your con&s;ciences by &s;ubmitting to his unrigh|teous impo&s;itions, and renouncing the <HI>truth as it is in Je&s;us,</HI> have lo&s;t your e&s;tates; been torn from your tendere&s;t connections; have langui&s;hed in dungeons, have groan|ed upon the wreck, and expired in flames. Speak, ye who &s;uffered in <HI>England</HI> in the <HI>Marian days!</HI> Speak, ye thou&s;ands, ye many thou&s;ands, that fell at once in the ma&s;&s;acres of <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Ireland!</HI> Speak, ye <HI>Walden&s;es,</HI> and <HI>Albigen&s;es,</HI> who fell in &s;till greater numbers, and more varied forms of torture! Your blood indeed is
<PB N="38" REF="013228_0036_0F904326423283E8">vocal, <HI>it crieth from the ground:</HI> Though art and fal&s;hood have been employed, to di&s;gui&s;e the facts, and to &s;tifle the voice; it pierces through all, and rings in the ears of men, the unparalleled cru|elty of that my&s;tical woman, that <HI>mother of abominations,</HI> the church of <HI>Rome; drunken with the blood of the Saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>IN vain does &s;he attempt to conceal, or palliate this part of her odious character: The &s;tain is indelible. To her we may apply the words of the prophet; <HI>though thou wa&s;h thee with nitre, and take thee much &s;oap, yet is thine iniquity marked before me, &s;aith the Lord God</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jerm. ii. 22.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT can be demon&s;trated from hi&s;tory that &s;he has &s;hed ten times more chri&s;|tian blood, by her holy wars, her cru|zades, her a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations, and numberle&s;s per&s;ecutions, than all the pagan Emper|ors united. The inhumanity of her court of inqui&s;ition is not to be equalled, among the mo&s;t barbarous nations, nor by any other court, ever erected by the greate&s;t tyrant.</P>
<P>WHAT an idea does it give us of the dete&s;table cruelty of the &s;ons of <HI>Rome,</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="013228_0037_0F8FB4EFAB6E8F90">to be told, that an <HI>American</HI> &s;avage, ready to expire under the hands of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> a&s;ked a prie&s;t, who offered to prepare him for Heaven, whether the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would dwell there: Being a&s;|&s;ured they would; then, &s;aid he, "let me go to another place." It was the lan|guage of nature: He knew he could not be happy with &s;uch a&s;&s;ociates. Much the &s;ame idea of chri&s;tianity was given to the pagan <HI>Saxons.

THE next character of the <HI>Man of Sin,</HI> is, <HI>he exalteth him&s;elf above all that is called God, or that is wor&s;hipped.</HI> Who does not immediately confe&s;s the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Rome</HI> in this de&s;cription? He exalteth him&s;elf, not only above all pa&s;tors, all eccle&s;ia&s;tical officers and dignitaries, but above all civil rulers, who are called Gods; above all Kings and Emperors. The Em|peror <HI>Frederick</HI> the fir&s;t, held the &s;tyrup of his hor&s;e, and was chid for holding it on the wrong &s;ide.

<P>This has not only been done by &s;ome who have filled the pontifical chair, but is
<PB N="41" REF="013228_0039_0F904329CBF57278">agreeable to one of the profe&s;&s;ed principles of the Romi&s;h church. It is to be &s;een in their <HI>decrees,</HI> of at lea&s;t equal venera|tion and authority among them, with the Bible it&s;elf; <Q>That all Kings and Em|perors ought to be &s;ubject to the Pope; that he is placed by the Lord over na|tions and kingdoms; not &s;ome only, but <HI>all:</HI> That what&s;oever the <HI>Roman</HI> church ordaineth, mu&s;t be ob&s;erved by <HI>all,</HI> without control, and everla&s;ting|ly; and that it is of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity to &s;alvation, that every human crea|ture &s;hould be &s;ubject to the holy fa|ther. Accordingly, <HI>Clement</HI> the fifth declared, that by his undoubted &s;upe|riority to the Emperor, and by the fulne&s;s of power Chri&s;t had given him in the per&s;on of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> he did an|nul all his proceedings.</Q></P>
<P>THE Apo&s;tle adds, <HI>So that he as God, &s;itteth in the temple of God, &s;hewing him|&s;elf that he is God.</HI> The temple of God, &s;ignifies, in prophetic language, the church of God; and as the <HI>Man of Sin</HI> was to appear after the abrogation of the Jewi&s;h law, it is plainly intimated here, that he was to be found in the chri&s;tian church; that by means of his rank and influence in this church, he was to ri&s;e to his exorbi|tant
<PB N="42" REF="013228_0040_0F90432B248CE730">power; and that it would be held and admini&s;tred in an eccle&s;ia&s;tical form. He is then a profe&s;&s;ed chri&s;tian: The au|thority he claims is &s;piritual; and in the church he receives the homage of a God.</P>
<P>WHAT can give us a more exact idea of the &s;overeign Pontiff at <HI>Rome?</HI> When he is elected, he is &s;eated on the high al|tar of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s church, the very place of the idolized ho&s;t, which the Papi&s;ts &s;ay, is Chri&s;t him&s;elf: The people pro&s;trate them&s;elves before him, and implore his favour and ble&s;&s;ing. They addre&s;s him, "Our Lord God the Pope." He extends his &s;inger, and makes a motion with his hand, and their &s;ins are all forgiven. Is not this like the feigned <HI>Jupiter,</HI> on old <HI>Olympus?</HI> Is not this to <HI>&s;it in the tem|ple as God?</HI></P>
<P>AFTERWARDS he &s;overeignly controls every thing in religion. He exalts him|&s;elf above God him&s;elf; he makes void the law of God by vain traditions, and im|pious e&s;tabli&s;hments of his own. He holds back from the people the &s;criptures of God, and places in their room his own decrees. He forgives &s;ins upon terms di|rectly oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e upon which God hath declared them to be forgiven; and allows vice to be ju&s;tified by a ca&s;ui&s;try,

<P>THE coming of the <HI>Man of Sin</HI> is &s;aid by the Apo&s;tle to be <HI>after the working of Satan.</HI> This I know is generally taken to refer to the <HI>&s;igns and lying wonders,</HI> men|tioned immediately after. But does it not appear natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that <HI>this coming after the working of Satan,</HI> may intend, more generally, after the <HI>model</HI> of Satan, <HI>the God of this world,</HI> in his own kingdom; or among the pagans, where he had &s;o great an influence; and that it contains a &s;trong intimation that the cor|rupt religion introduced and e&s;tabli&s;hed by the <HI>Man of Sin,</HI> &s;hould bear a &s;trong re&s;emblance to that which was formerly found in the kingdom of darkne&s;s? That this is true, no one who takes a fair and impartial view of both, can doubt. So that however really chri&s;tian <HI>Rome</HI> once was, it has for many ages &s;o far returned to an imitation of its former pagan ido|latries and &s;uper&s;titions, that chri&s;tianity &s;eems to be almo&s;t covered and buried under them.</P>
<P>IN place of the wor&s;hip of the one God and Father of all, their prayers and vows are chiefly directed to the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and other &s;aints. The canonizaton of

<P>THE cu&s;tom of leaving legacies to their gods, which grew to &s;uch exce&s;s, as to require being bounded by the <HI>Roman</HI> law, as we learn from <HI>Ulpian,</HI> has in no &s;mall degree been followed by the church of <HI>Rome.</HI> In imitation of the pagan fe&s;tivals, the Popi&s;h calendar has marked at lea&s;t an equal number of chri&s;tian holidays. The writers of their legends, and lives of the Saints, have evidently borrowed the &s;ub|&s;tance of many marvellous tales from <HI>Ovid,</HI> and other pagan authors, leaving out at the &s;ame time, the beauty and ele|gance of the cla&s;&s;ic originals<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vid.</HI> Jortin, and Middleton's Letter from <HI>Rome.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Go into the churches of modern <HI>Rome,</HI> and according to the account of the mo&s;t judicious and faithful travellers, you will &s;ee almo&s;t every thing, <HI>after the working of Satan,</HI> and the model of pagani&s;m. You will &s;ee many altars, called chri&s;tian, &s;moaking at once in the &s;ame church, with incen&s;e; though the primitive pro|fe&s;&s;ors of the go&s;pel, would endure any thing, rather than offer incen&s;e before an idol. You will there &s;ee, as in ancient <HI>Rome,</HI> innumerable tapers and candles, burning before the &s;hrines and images of
<PB N="45" REF="013228_0043_0F90432DC7F575D8">their Saints: You will &s;ee offerings and votive gifts of various kinds, hanging round their altars as in a pagan temple; and innumerable devotees, bowing and pro&s;trating them&s;elves before images of wood and &s;tone; and &s;ome of the&s;e the very images that were adored by pagans, having undergone no other change than the ceremony of bapti&s;m Go into their roads, and you will meet with many &s;uch images, like tho&s;e of the guardians of the high-ways among the Heathen, and tra|vellers in various forms paying their de|votions to them. Enter their cities, you will find the &s;ame kind of idols, and re|ceiving the &s;ame homage, at the corners of the &s;treets, in the baths, in the mar|kets, and in almo&s;t every place of public re&s;ort. All this, which is certainly ac|cording to the model, formerly produced <HI>by the working of Satan,</HI> in the darkne&s;s of heatheni&s;m, you will now find in the patrimony of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> and in the very city where his pretended &s;ucce&s;&s;or &s;its en|throned.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Man of Sin,</HI> comes, &s;ays the Apo&s;|tle, <HI>with all power, and &s;igns, and lying wonders: And with all deceiveablene&s;s of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> This part of the de|&s;cription, as exactly corre&s;ponds to the papal Antichri&s;t, as any we have con&s;ider|ed.

<P>IT would be endle&s;s to reckon up all the <HI>unrighteous deceivings</HI> practi&s;ed by the papal Antichri&s;t; and to trace the art and &s;ubtilty employed to cover the fal&s;hood and deformity of his religious &s;y&s;tem.

Though the idolatry and &s;uper&s;ti|tion he authorizes are gro&s;s in many in|&s;tances as the pagan; and though the people are known to addre&s;s the image, and to believe that the Saint &s;ome how dwells in it; yet the plea is, that the

<P>WHILE the <HI>Man of Sin</HI> ro&s;e, the go&s;|pel was ob&s;cured, and gradually withdrawn
<PB N="52" REF="013228_0050_0F904335035E07B0">from the view of men; <HI>the truth was held,</HI> or impri&s;oned, in <HI>unrighteou&s;ne&s;s:</HI> But when this was &s;et at liberty, and the &s;acred volumes opened, the papal &s;y&s;tem felt the &s;hock, and was evidently bla&s;ted, though not de&s;troyed, as by the fire of Heaven; bla&s;ted by the &s;troke of that go&s;pel, which our Saviour compares to <HI>the lightning which cometh out of the Ea&s;t, and &s;hineth even to the We&s;t.</HI> So fire pro|ceedeth out of the mouth of the two wit|ne&s;&s;es in the Revelations, and <HI>devoureth their enemies.</HI> The &s;implicity of the go&s;|pel, carries with it a wonderful light and energy: It is great, and will finally prevail. Like a flame, it goes through <HI>the briars and thorns</HI> that oppo&s;e it, and <HI>burns them together.</HI> In its progre&s;s, it puni&s;hes and torments the ob&s;tinately erroneous and wicked: They <HI>gnaw their tongues for pain,</HI> at the detection of tho&s;e errors they will not renounce, and at the pungent reproof of tho&s;e vices which they cannot for&s;ake. They have often other puni&s;hments from the judicial di&s;pen&s;ations of Heaven, even in this life; which are a prelude of what &s;hall be awarded them, in proportion to their guilt, at the bar of the Son of Man.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd coming of Chri&s;t extends in &s;ome &s;en&s;e from his a&s;cen&s;ion to the
<PB N="53" REF="013228_0051_0F9043353A6B6DD8">final judgment. In this period Antichri&s;t will be con&s;umed. We have &s;een already this part of the prediction in a con&s;iderable degree fulfilled. He has &s;urpri&s;ingly wa&s;ted away. He no longer appears what he once was; the di&s;po&s;er of crowns, the arbiter of kingdoms, and the dread of the world. His &s;trength is abated, and the reverence that was once paid him by Prin|ces greatly dimini&s;hed. He now palliates and &s;eems half a&s;hamed of what he once openly profe&s;&s;ed, and boa&s;ted in. This is owing to the increa&s;ing light &s;pringing from the reformation.</P>
<P>NOR ought we to overlook a late event, that de&s;erves particular attention. One of his religious orders, I mean the <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> remarkable for a mixture of &s;ubtilty and enthu&s;ia&s;m, which rendered them &s;ingular|ly active and &s;ucce&s;sful in his cau&s;e, has not long &s;ince been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by Princes, that once were mo&s;t zealou&s;ly devoted to him, and particularly friendly to this ve|ry order. Even the Pope him&s;elf, accord|ing to &s;ome recent accounts, has at length been compelled, &s;orely again&s;t his will, to imitate their example, and to concur with them in this &s;ignal, but very humiliating act of reformation. The&s;e things, among others, plainly &s;how, how far this <HI>Lucifer,</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="013228_0052_0F90433604CA8448">&s;on of the morning, this pretended <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">n|tain of light, and di&s;pen&s;er of infallible knowledge, hath declined from his zenith, and may be one means of accelerating his de&s;cent. However this may be, we are a&s;&s;ured, that at furthe&s;t, he will be totally and ab&s;olutely de&s;troyed by the brightne&s;s of our Lord's &s;econd coming.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, whoever compares the predictions of <HI>Daniel</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> with that of <HI>Paul</HI> in our text, will find in them a &s;urprizing agreement; and that all the&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;ervants of God, &s;pake of the &s;ame iniquitous and oppre&s;&s;ive power that was to ri&s;e in his kingdom, in latter ages, and oppo&s;e him&s;elf to it: A power that <HI>&s;peaketh great things, even great things again&s;t the mo&s;t High, and is full of the names of bla&s;phemy:</HI> A power that <HI>pre|vaileth again&s;t, and weareth out the Saints; that changeth times and laws,</HI> and a&s;&s;umeth an authority, <HI>over all kin|dreds, and tongues, and nations:</HI> A pow|er that <HI>ca&s;teth down the ho&s;t of Heaven,</HI> all civil rulers, <HI>and magnifieth him&s;elf again&s;t the Prince of the ho&s;t;</HI> to whom notwith&s;tanding, <HI>the Kings of the earth do give their &s;trength:</HI> A power that <HI>deceiv|eth, by fal&s;e miracles, done in the &s;ight of the bea&s;t, them that dwell upon the earth;</HI>
<PB N="55" REF="013228_0053_0F904336C3618E08">and upon whom <HI>the judgment &s;hould final|ly &s;it, to take away his dominion, and to con&s;ume and de&s;troy it to the end.</HI></P>
<P>"THE predictions of the three &s;ervants of God above-named, concerning the cor|ruptions of chri&s;tianity in the Romi&s;h church, and concerning the political &s;tate of the world from fir&s;t to la&s;t, but e&s;pe|cially as the revolutions of empire had a relation to our religion, the&s;e, I &s;ay, when united, form a prophetic picture, which in re&s;pect of the grandeur and importance of the events delineated therein, the variety and &s;ingularity of the particulars whereof the&s;e events con&s;i&s;t, the clearne&s;s and pre|ci&s;ion with which they are delineated, the exactne&s;s of their accompli&s;hment, and the length of time taken up in the accompli&s;h|ment, is one of the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing ob|jects which it is po&s;&s;ible for the human mind to contemplate. And therefore the due examination of this picture, cannot fail to &s;trike all wi&s;e men with the highe&s;t conceptions of the pre&s;cience and power of God, and with the deepe&s;t veneration for the chri&s;tian religion, in the records of which this a&s;toni&s;hing picture is found. For common &s;en&s;e dictates, that the Ruler of the univer&s;e never would give the know|ledge of future events to impo&s;tors; e&s;|pecially
<PB N="56" REF="013228_0054_0F9043377B8E8560">as upon the credit of that know|ledge, they have required mankind to be|lieve the hi&s;tory of Je&s;us. Wherefore, the corruptions of chri&s;tianity, in&s;tead of be|ing any objection again&s;t the divinity of our religion, by having been &s;o particular|ly predicted, are in reality the foundation of one of the &s;tronge&s;t arguments in its favour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Macknight</HI>'s Truth of Go&s;pel Hi&s;tory. Page 602.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>TIME will not allow me to enlarge on the reflections which naturally ari&s;e from our &s;ubject.</P>
<P>WHAT a ble&s;&s;ing to mankind was the reformation? What a yoke of bondage did it break? Even the papal power, where it &s;till prevails, has been tempered by it. It was at once favourable to civil liberty, and to the rights of con&s;cience. Religion and learning revived together. The Bible, the fountain of divine knowledge being unco|vered, the thir&s;ty came and <HI>drank of the water of life freely.</HI> At the &s;ame time the be&s;t human models of writing, and the noble&s;t &s;entiments on civility and go|vernment, were read with avidity in the ancient cla&s;&s;ics. The church emerged from darkne&s;s; human &s;ociety was poli&s;hed; the arts cultivated, and commerce enlarged.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="013228_0055_0F90433890001D78">
THE happy fruits of the reformation have been tran&s;planted to <HI>America;</HI> and what a change have they made already in the face of this continent? Here may they all flouri&s;h to the &s;econd coming of the Son of Man! And may this literary <HI>Society,</HI> according to the generous de&s;ign of its founders, be eminently conducive to &s;o happy a purpo&s;e! We have a Romi&s;h Bi&s;hop, and a Popi&s;h colony, not far from us; where, I am well informed, in&s;tead of the advancement of prote&s;tant truth, &s;ince its &s;ubjection to the Briti&s;h govern|ment, numbers have been perverted from our own profe&s;&s;ion. And if popery, de|ceitfully a&s;&s;uming a milder form, &s;eems to be le&s;s dreaded and abhored than it once was; let us be upon our guard, and re|membering it is popery &s;till, be prepared to oppo&s;e it in every form. At be&s;t it is the extreme&s;t de&s;poti&s;m. It decides all things at once, and by mere authority, and allows no examination of its own mandates and decrees. It is a direct, an everla&s;ting enemy to freedom of enquiry, and con&s;equently to knowledge, and good literature. There are indeed many learn|ed catholics; but the learning among them is, in one way or another, greatly owing to the reformation: For when po|pery reigned without oppo&s;ition, igno|rance
<PB N="58" REF="013228_0056_0F90433B268C83D8">every where prevailed. And even at this day, the body of the people in the Romi&s;h, are not near &s;o enlightened as in the prote&s;tant communion.</P>
<P>POPERY is incompatible with the &s;afety of a free government. It &s;ets up a fo|reign head, &s;uperior to all civil rulers; a &s;piritual power that reaches to every thing upon earth, and can brook no control. Trampling upon the rights of con&s;cience, and a&s;&s;uming an authority to di&s;&s;olve eve|ry &s;acred obligation, what pledge can it po&s;&s;ibly leave us for the &s;ecurity of civil freedom?</P>
<P>COMPARE the pre&s;ent &s;tate of <HI>Italy</HI> with what it once was. Where are the poets, the orators, the philo&s;ophers, the &s;tate&s;men and heroes, that once guided, defended, and adorned that di&s;tingui&s;hed country? Where are the numbers it &s;up|ported, and the &s;pirit and vigour of its inhabitants? Nature is the &s;ame; it is tyranny, and mo&s;t of all the papal tyran|ny, that hath made the change. We have indeed, may a Popi&s;h bigot &s;ay, we have happily no more the fierce contentions of ancient <HI>Rome:</HI> All things are now &s;ettled by an indi&s;putable authority; and we are at peace. But have there been no bloody
<PB N="59" REF="013228_0057_0F90433B4BF99CE0">conte&s;ts in papal <HI>Rome?</HI> And what kind of tranquility does it ever enjoy? Is it the ea&s;e and happine&s;s of a vigorous well go|verned &s;tate? Far from it: It is the &s;i|lence of death; it is the peace of a church yard.</P>
<P>LET us therefore, <HI>&s;tand fa&s;t in the li|berty wherewith Chri&s;t has made us free,</HI> and allow no un&s;criptural impo&s;ition, no trace of the papal bondage, to be found among us! May a liberal inquiry, a free and temperate di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, di&s;&s;ipate error of every kind, and by advancing truth, &s;ecure the true order and felicity both of church and &s;tate! May the honor of the in&s;pired writings, as the only infallible rule of faith and practice, and the right of private judgment, the ba&s;is of the re|formation, ever be &s;acredly pre&s;erved among us! And may &s;erious piety, and chri&s;tian morals, the end of all, adorn our profe&s;&s;ion as prote&s;tants, and ever keep pace with our improvements in &s;pecula|tive knowledge!</P>
