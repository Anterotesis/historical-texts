<OPENER><DATELINE>Crichoff, in White Ru&s;&s;ia, <DATE>Jan. 1787,</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AMONG the various &s;pecies or mo|difications of liberty, of which on different occa&s;ions we have heard &s;o much in England, I do not recollect ever &s;eeing any thing yet offer|ed in behalf of the <HI>liberty of making one's own terms in money bargains.</HI> From &s;o general and univer&s;al a neglect, it is an old notion of mine, as you well know, that this meek and una&s;&s;um|ing
<PB N="6" REF="030057_0005_0FE41AE62984EFD0">&s;pecies of liberty has been &s;uffering much inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>A fancy has taken me, ju&s;t now, to trouble you with my rea&s;ons: which, if you think them capable of an&s;wering any good purpo&s;e, you may forward to the pre&s;s; or, in the other ca&s;e, what will give you le&s;s trouble, to the &s;ire.</P>
<P>In a word, the propo&s;ition I have been accu&s;|tomed to lay down to my&s;elf on this &s;ubject, is the following one, viz. that <HI>no man of ripe years and of &s;ound mind, acting freely, and with his eyes open, ought to be hindered, with a view to his advantage, from making &s;uch bargain, in the way of obtaining money, as he thinks fit; nor,</HI> (what is a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence) <HI>any body hin|dered from &s;upplying him, upon any terms he thinks proper to accede to.</HI></P>
<P>This propo&s;ition, were it to be received, would level, you &s;ee, at one &s;troke, all the bar|riers which law, either &s;tatute or common, have in their united wi&s;dom &s;et up, either again&s;t the
<PB N="7" REF="030057_0006_0FE41AEA41A0F248">crying &s;in of U&s;ury, or again&s;t the hard-named and little-heard-of practice of Champerty; to which we mu&s;t al&s;o add a portion of the multi|farious, and as little-heard-of offence, of Main|tenance.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion, were it any individual anta|goni&s;t I had to deal with, my part would be a &s;mooth and ea&s;y one. <Q>You, who fetter con|tracts, you who lay re&s;traints on the liberty of man, it is for you</Q> (I &s;hould &s;ay) <Q>to a&s;&s;ign a rea&s;on for your doing &s;o.</Q> That contracts in general ought to be ob&s;erved, is a rule, the propriety of which, no man was ever yet found wrongheaded enough to deny; if this ca&s;e is one of the exceptions (for &s;ome doubtle&s;s there are) which the &s;afety and wel|fare of every &s;ociety require &s;hould be taken out of that general rule, in this ca&s;e, as in all tho&s;e others, it lies upon him, who alleges the nece&s;|&s;ity of the exception, to produce a rea&s;on for it.</P>
<P>This, I &s;ay would be a &s;hort and very ea&s;y method with an individual: but as the world
<PB N="8" REF="030057_0007_0FE41AEBE74FE378">has no mouth of its own to plead by, no certain attorney by which it can <Q>come and defend this force and injury,</Q> I mu&s;t even find argu|ments for it at a venture, and ran&s;ack my own imagination for &s;uch phantoms as I can find to fight with.</P>
<P>In favour of the re&s;traints oppo&s;ed to the &s;pecies of liberty I contend for, I can imagine but five arguments.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II. <HI>Rea&s;ons for Re&s;traints.&mdash;Prevention of U&s;ury.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I WILL begin with the <HI>prevention</HI> of <HI>u&s;ury:</HI> becau&s;e in the &s;ound of the word <HI>u&s;ury</HI> lies, I take it, the main &s;trength of the argu|ment: or, to &s;peak &s;trictly, of what is of more importance than all argument, of the hold which the opinion I am combating has obtained on the imaginations and pa&s;&s;ions of mankind.</P>
<P>'U&s;ury is a bad thing, and as &s;uch ought to be prevented: u&s;urers are a bad &s;ort of men, a very bad &s;ort of men, and as &s;uch ought to be puni&s;hed and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.' The&s;e are among the &s;tring of propo&s;itions which every man finds handed down to him from his progenitors: which mo&s;t men are di&s;po&s;ed to accede to with|out examination, and indeed not unnaturally nor even unrea&s;onably di&s;po&s;ed; for it is impo&s;&s;ible
<PB N="10" REF="030057_0009_0FE41AEFE0F7F8D0">the bulk of mankind &s;hould find lei&s;ure, had they the ability, to examine into the grounds of an hundredth part of the rules and maxims, which they find them&s;elves obliged to act upon. Very good apology this for John Trot: but a little more inqui&s;itivene&s;s may be required of legi&s;lators.</P>
<P>You, my friend, by whom the true force of words is &s;o well under&s;tood, have, I am &s;ure, gone before me in perceiving, that to &s;ay u&s;ury is a thing to be prevented, is neither more or le&s;s than begging the matter in que&s;tion. I know of but two definitions that can po&s;&s;ibly be given of u&s;ury; one is, the taking of a greater intere&s;t than the law allows: this may be &s;tiled the <HI>political</HI> or <HI>legal</HI> definition. The other is the taking of a greater intere&s;t than it is u&s;ual for men to give and take; this may be &s;tiled the <HI>moral</HI> one: and this, where the law has not interfered, is plainly enough the only one. It is plain, that in order for u&s;ury to be prohibited by law, a po&s;itive de&s;cription mu&s;t have been found for it by law, fixing, or rather &s;uper&s;eding, the
<PB N="11" REF="030057_0010_0FE41AF3AF937568">moral one. To &s;ay, then, that u&s;ury is a thing that ought to be prevented, is &s;aying neither more nor le&s;s, than that the utmo&s;t rate of intere&s;t which &s;hall be taken ought to be fixed; and that fixation enforced by penalties, or &s;uch other means, if any, as may an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of preventing the breach of it. A law puni&s;hing u&s;ury &s;uppo&s;es, therefore, a law fixing the allow|ed legal rate of intere&s;t; and the propriety of the penal law mu&s;t depend upon the propriety of the &s;imply-prohibitive, or, if you plea&s;e, de|claratory one.</P>
<P>One thing then is plain; that, antecedently to cu&s;tom growing from convention, there can be no &s;uch thing as u&s;ury: for what rate of intere&s;t is there that can naturally be more pro|per than another? what natural fixed price can there be for the u&s;e of money more than for the u&s;e of any other thing? Were it not then for cu&s;tom, u&s;ury, con&s;idered in a moral view, would not &s;o much as admit of a defini|tion: &s;o far from having exi&s;tence, it would not &s;o much as be conceivable: nor therefore could
<PB N="12" REF="030057_0011_0FE41ACC5953DB30">the law, in the definition it took upon it&s;elf to give of &s;uch offence, have &s;o much as a guide to &s;teer by. Cu&s;tom therefore is the &s;ole ba&s;is, which, either the morali&s;t in his rules and precepts, or the legi&s;lator in his injunctions, can have to build upon. But what ba&s;is can be more weak or unwarrantable, as a ground for coercive mea&s;ures, than cu&s;tom re&s;ulting from free choice? My neighbours, being at liberty, have happened to concur among them&s;elves in dealing at a cer|tain rate of intere&s;t. I, who have money to lend, and Titius, who wants to borrow it of me, would be glad, the one of us to accept, the other to give, an intere&s;t &s;omewhat higher than theirs: why is the liberty they exerci&s;e to be made a pretence for depriving me and Titius of ours?</P>
<P>Nor has blind cu&s;tom, thus made the &s;ole and arbitrary guide, any thing of &s;teadine&s;s or uniformity in its deci&s;ions: it has varied, from age to age, in the &s;ame country: it varies from country to country, in the &s;ame age: and the legal rate has varied along with it: and indeed,
<PB N="13" REF="030057_0012_0FE41AF5947E7D90">with regard to times pa&s;t, it is from the legal rate, more readily than from any other &s;ource, that we collect the cu&s;tomary. Among the Romans, till the time of Ju&s;tinian, we find it as high as twelve per cent.: in England, &s;o late as the time of Henry VIII. we find it at ten per cent. Succeeding &s;tatutes reduced it to eight, then to &s;ix, and la&s;tly to five, where it &s;tands at pre&s;ent. Even at pre&s;ent in Ireland it is at &s;ix per cent.; and in the We&s;t-Indies at eight per cent.; and in Hindo&s;tan, where there is no rate limited by law, the lowe&s;t cu&s;tomary rate is ten or twelve. At Con&s;tantinople, in certain ca&s;es, as I have been well informed, thirty per cent. is a common rate. Now, of all the&s;e widely different rates, what one is there that is intrin&s;i|cally more proper than another? What is it that evidences this propriety in each in&s;tance? what but the mutual convenience of the parties, as manife&s;ted by their con&s;ent? It is convenience, then, that has produced whatever there has been of cu&s;tom in the matter: What can there then be in cu&s;tom, to make it a better guide than the convenience which gave it birth? and what is
<PB N="14" REF="030057_0013_0FE41AF790EA0460">there in convenience, that &s;hould make it a wor&s;e guide in one ca&s;e than in another? It would be convenience to me to give &s;ix per cent. for money: I wi&s;h to do &s;o. "No," (&s;ays the law) "you &s;han't."&mdash;Why &s;o? "Becau&s;e it is not conve|nient to your neighbour to give above five for it." Can any thing be more ab&s;urd than &s;uch a rea&s;on?</P>
<P>Much has not been done, I think, by legi&s;|lators as yet, in the way of fixing the price of other commodities: and, in what little has been done, the probity of the intention has, I believe, in general, been rather more unque&s;|tionable than the rectitude of the principle, or the felicity of the re&s;ult. Putting money out at intere&s;t, is exchanging pre&s;ent money for future: but why a policy, which, as applied to exchanges in general, would be generally deem|ed ab&s;urd and mi&s;chievous, &s;hould be deemed nece&s;&s;ary in the in&s;tance of this particular kind of exchange, mankind are as yet to learn. For him who takes as much as he can get for the u&s;e of any other &s;ort of thing, an hou&s;e for in&s;tance,
<PB N="15" REF="030057_0014_0FE41AF98F31EC50">there is no particular appellation, nor any mark of di&s;repute: nobody is a&s;hamed of doing &s;o, nor is it u&s;ual &s;o much as to profe&s;s to do other|wi&s;e. Why a man, who takes as much as he can get, be it &s;ix, or &s;even, or eight, or ten per cent. for the u&s;e of a &s;um of money, &s;hould be called u&s;urer, &s;hould be loaded with an op|probrious name, any more than if he had bought a hou&s;e with it, and made a proportionable pro|fit by the hou&s;e, is more than I can &s;ee.</P>
<P>Another thing I would al&s;o wi&s;h to learn, is, why the legi&s;lator &s;hould be more anxious to limit the rate of intere&s;t one way, than the other? why he &s;hould &s;et his face again&s;t the owners of that &s;pecies of property more than of any other? why he &s;hould make it his bu&s;ine&s;s to prevent their getting <HI>more</HI> than a certain price for the u&s;e of it, rather than to prevent their getting <HI>le&s;s?</HI> why, in &s;hort, he &s;hould not take means for making it penal to offer le&s;s, for ex|ample, than five per cent. as well as to accept more? Let any one that can, find an an&s;wer to the&s;e que&s;tions; it is more than I can do: I
<PB N="16" REF="030057_0015_0FE41AFCB7513970">except always the di&s;tant and imperceptible ad|vantage, of &s;inking the price of goods of all kinds; and in that remote way, multiplying the future enjoyment of individuals. But this was a con&s;ideration by far too di&s;tant and refined, to have been the original ground for confining the limitation to this &s;ide.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III. <HI>Rea&s;ons for Re&s;traint&mdash;Prevention of Prodigality.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HAVING done with &s;ounds, I come gladly to propo&s;itions; which, as far as they are true in point of fact, may de&s;erve the name of rea&s;ons. And fir&s;t, as to the efficacy of &s;uch re&s;trictive laws with regard to the <HI>prevention of prodigality.</HI></P>
<P>That prodigality is a bad thing, and that the prevention of it is a proper object for the legi&s;|lator to propo&s;e to him&s;elf, &s;o long as he con|fines him&s;elf to, what I look upon as, proper mea&s;ures, I have no objection to allow, at lea&s;t for the purpo&s;e of argument; though, were this the principal que&s;tion, I &s;hould look upon it as incumbent on me to place in a fair light the rea&s;ons there may be for doubting, how far,
<PB N="18" REF="030057_0017_0FE41B007387E8E8">with regard to a per&s;on arrived at the age of di&s;cretion, third per&s;ons may be competent judges, which of two pains may be of greater force and value to him, the pre&s;ent pain of re&s;training his pre&s;ent de&s;ires, or the future contingent pain he may be expo&s;ed to &s;uffer from the want to which the expence of gratifying the&s;e de&s;ires may hereafter have reduced him. To prevent our doing mi&s;chief to one another, it is but too nece&s;&s;ary to put bridles into all our mouths: it is nece&s;&s;ary to the tranquillity and very being of &s;ociety: but that the tacking of leading-&s;trings upon the backs of grown per&s;ons, in order to prevent their doing them&s;elves mi&s;chief, is not nece&s;&s;ary either to the being or tranquillity of &s;ociety, however conducive to its well-being, I think cannot be di&s;puted. Such paternal, or, if you plea&s;e, maternal care, may be a good work, but it certainly is but a work of &s;upere|rogation.</P>
<P>For my own part, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that &s;o long as &s;uch methods only are employed as to me appear proper ones; and &s;uch there are, I
<PB N="19" REF="030057_0018_0FE41B8AD833A9D8">&s;hould not feel my&s;elf di&s;inclined to &s;ee &s;ome mea&s;ures taken for the re&s;training of prodigality: but this I cannot look upon as being of the number. My rea&s;ons I will now endeavour to lay before you.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, I take it, that it is neither natural nor u&s;ual for prodigals, as &s;uch, to be|take them&s;elves to this method, I mean, that of giving a rate of intere&s;t above the ordinary one, to &s;upply their wants.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, no man, I hope you will allow, prodigal or not prodigal, ever thinks of borrowing money to &s;pend, &s;o long as he has ready money of his own, or effects which he can turn into ready money without lo&s;s. And this deduction &s;trikes off what, I &s;uppo&s;e, you will look upon as the greate&s;t proportion of the per&s;ons &s;ubject, at any given time, to the impu|tation of prodigality.</P>
<P>In the next place, no man, in &s;uch a coun|try as Great Britain at lea&s;t, has occa&s;ion, nor
<PB N="20" REF="030057_0019_0FE41B026DB4BAB8">is at all likely, to take up money at an extraor|dinary rate of intere&s;t, who has &s;ecurity to give, equal to that upon which money is commonly to be had at the highe&s;t ordinary rate. While &s;o many adverti&s;e, as are to be &s;een every day adverti&s;ing, money to be lent at five per cent. what &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s a man, who has any thing to offer that can be called a &s;ecurity, to give, for example, &s;ix per cent. is more than I can conceive.</P>
<P>Yon may &s;ay, perhaps, that a man who wi&s;hes to lend his money out upon &s;ecurity, wi&s;hes to have his intere&s;t punctually, and that without the expence, and hazard, and trouble, and odium of going to law; and that, on this account, it is better to have a &s;ober man to deal with, than a prodigal. So far I allow you; but were you to add, that on this account it would be nece&s;&s;ery for a prodigal to offer more than another man, there I &s;hould di&s;agree with you. In the fir&s;t place, it is not &s;o ea&s;y a thing, nor, I take it, a common thing, for the lender upon
<PB N="21" REF="030057_0020_0FE41AC8429072C8">&s;ecurity to be able to judge, or even to form any attempt to judge, whether the conduct of one who offers to borrow his money is, or is not of &s;uch a ca&s;t, as to bring him under this de&s;crip|tion. The que&s;tion, prodigal or not prodigal, depends upon two pieces of information; neither of which, in general, is very ea&s;y to come at: on the one hand, the amount of his means and rea&s;onable expectations; on the other hand, the amount of his expenditure. The goodne&s;s or badne&s;s of the &s;ecurity is a que&s;tion of a very dif|ferent nature: upon this head, every man has a known and ready means of obtaining that &s;ort of information, which is the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory the nature of things affords, by going to his lawyer. It is, accordingly, I take it, on their lawyers' opinion, that lenders in general found their determination in the&s;e ca&s;es, and not upon any calculations they may have formed, con|cerning the receipt and expenditure of the bor|rower. But even &s;uppo&s;ing a man's di&s;po&s;ition to prodigality to be ever &s;o well known, I take it there are always enough to be found, to whom
<PB N="22" REF="030057_0021_0FE41ACEA1CBEAA0">&s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition would be rather an induce|ment than an objection, &s;o long as they were &s;a|tisfied with the &s;ecurity. Every body knows the advantage to be made in ca&s;e of mortgage, by foreclo&s;ing or forcing a &s;ale: and that this advantage is not uncommonly looked out for, will, I believe, hardly be doubted by any one, who has had any occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve the cour&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s in the court of Chancery.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, &s;o long as a prodigal has any thing to pledge, or to di&s;po&s;e of, whether in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or even in rever&s;ion, whether of a certain or even of a contingent nature, I &s;ee not, how he can receive the &s;malle&s;t benefit, from any laws that are, or can be made to fix the rate of in|tere&s;t. For, &s;uppo&s;e the law to be efficacious as far as it goes, and that the prodigal can find none of tho&s;e mon&s;ters called u&s;urers to deal with him, does he lie quiet? No &s;uch thing: he goes on and gets the money he wants, by felling his intere&s;t in&s;tead of borrowing. He goes on, I &s;ay: for if he has prudence enough to &s;top him any where, he is not that &s;ort of man,
<PB N="23" REF="030057_0022_0FE41B07ED539788">whom it can be worth while for the law to attempt &s;topping by &s;uch means. It is plain enough then, I conclude, that to a prodigal thus circum&s;tanced, the law cannot be of any &s;er|vice; on the contrary, it may, and in many ca&s;es mu&s;t, be of di&s;&s;ervice to him, by de|nying him the option of a re&s;ource which, how di&s;advantageous &s;oever, could not well have proved more &s;o, but would naturally have proved le&s;s &s;o, than tho&s;e which it leaves &s;till open to him. But of this hereafter.</P>
<P>I now come to the only remaining cla&s;s of prodigals, viz. tho&s;e who have nothing that can be called a &s;ecurity to offer. The&s;e, certainly, are not more likely to get money upon an ex|traordinary rate of intere&s;t, than an ordi|nary one. Per&s;ons who either feel, or find rea|&s;ons for pretending to feel, a friend&s;hip for the borrower, cannot take of him more than the ordinary rate of intere&s;t: per&s;ons, who have no &s;uch motives for lending him, will not lend him at all. If they know him for what he is, that will prevent them of cour&s;e: and even
<PB N="24" REF="030057_0023_0FE41B0995C253E8">though they &s;hould know nothing of him by any other circum&s;tance, the very circum&s;tance of his not being able to find a friend to tru&s;t him at the highe&s;t ordinary rate, will be &s;ufficient rea&s;on to a &s;tranger for looking upon him as a man, who, in the judgment of his friends, is not likely to pay.</P>
<P>The way that prodigals run into debt, after they have &s;pent their &s;ub&s;tance, is, I take it, by borrowing of their friends and acquaintance, at ordinary intere&s;t, or more commonly at no in|tere&s;t, &s;mall &s;ums, &s;uch as each man may be content to lo&s;e, or be a&s;hamed to a&s;k real &s;ecu|rity for; and as prodigals have generally an ex|ten&s;ive acquaintance (exten&s;ive acquaintance being at once the cau&s;e and effect of prodigality) the &s;um total of the money a man may thus find means to &s;quander, may be con&s;iderable, though each &s;um borrowed may, relatively to the circum&s;tances of the lender, have been in|con&s;iderable. This I believe to be the race which prodigals, who have &s;pent their all, run at pre|&s;ent, under the actual &s;y&s;tem of re&s;training
<PB N="25" REF="030057_0024_0FE41B0B92862C18">laws: and this, and no other, I take it, would be the race they would run, were tho&s;e laws out of the way.</P>
<P>Another con&s;ideration there is, I think, which will complete your conviction, if it was not complete before, of the inefficacy of the&s;e laws, as to the putting any &s;ort of re&s;traint upon prodigality. This is, that there is another &s;et of people from whom prodigals get what they want, and always will get it, &s;o long as credit la&s;ts, in &s;pite of all laws again&s;t high intere&s;t; and, &s;hould they find it nece&s;&s;ary, at an ex|pence more than equal to any exce&s;s of in|tere&s;t they might otherwi&s;e have to give.&mdash; I mean the trade&s;men who deal in the goods they want. Every body knows it is much ea&s;ier to get goods than money. People tru&s;t goods upon much &s;lenderer &s;ecurity than they do money: it is very natural they &s;hould do &s;o: ordinary profit upon the whole capi|tal employed in a man's trade, even after the expence of warehou&s;e rent, journeymen's wages, and other &s;uch general charges, are ta|ken
<PB N="26" REF="030057_0025_0FE41B0F1B3145F0">in to the account, and &s;et again&s;t it, is at lea&s;t equal to double intere&s;t; &s;ay ten per cent. Or|dinary profit upon any particular parcel of goods mu&s;t therefore be a great deal more, &s;ay at lea&s;t triple intere&s;t, fifteen per cent.: in the way of trading, then, a man can afford to be at lea&s;t three times as adventurous, as he can, in the way of lending, and with equal prudence. So long, then, as a man is looked upon as one who will pay, he can much ea&s;ier get the goods be wants, than he could the money to buy them with, though he were content to give for it twice, or even thrice the ordinary rate of intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing any body, for the &s;ake of extraor|dinary gain, to be willing to run the ri&s;k of &s;up|plying him, although he did not look upon his per&s;onal &s;ecurity to be equal to that of another man, and for the &s;ake of the extraordinary profit to run the extraordinary ri&s;k; in the trader, in &s;hort in every &s;ort of trader whom he was accu&s;|tomed to deal with in his &s;olvent days, he &s;ees a per&s;on who may accept of any rate of profit, without the &s;malle&s;t danger from any laws that
<PB N="27" REF="030057_0026_0FE41B10C881F2B0">are, or can be made again&s;t u&s;ury. How idle, then, to think of &s;topping a man from making &s;ix, or &s;even, or eight per cent. intere&s;t, when, if he choo&s;es to run a ri&s;k proportionable, he may in this way make thirty or forty per cent. or any rate you plea&s;e! And as to the prodigal, if he cannot get what he wants upon the&s;e terms, what chance is there of his getting it upon any terms, &s;uppo&s;ing the laws again&s;t u&s;ury to be away? This then is another way, in which, in&s;tead of &s;erving, it injures him, by narrowing his option, and driving him from a market which might have proved le&s;s di&s;advantageous, to a more di&s;advantageous one.</P>
<P>As far as prodigality, then, is concerned, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I cannot &s;ee the u&s;e of &s;topping the cur|rent of expenditure in this way at the fo&s;&s;et, when there are &s;o many unpreventable ways of letting it run out at the bung-hole.</P>
<P>Whether any harm is done to &s;ociety, upon the whole, by letting &s;o much money drop at once out of the pockets of the prodigal, who
<PB N="28" REF="030057_0027_0FE41B12C286F518">would have gone on wa&s;ting it, into the till of the frugal trade&s;man, who will lay it up, is not worth the enquiry for the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e: what is plain is, that, &s;o far as the &s;aving the prodigal from paying at an extraordinary rate for what he gets to &s;pend, is the object of the law, that object is not at all promoted, by fix|ing the rate of intere&s;t upon money borrowed. On the contrary, if the law has any effect, it runs counter to that object: &s;ince, were he to borrow, it would only be, in as far as he could borrow at a rate inferior to that at which other|wi&s;e he would be obliged to buy. Preventing his borrowing at an extra rate, may have the effect of increa&s;ing his di&s;tre&s;s, but cannot have the effect of le&s;&s;ening it: allowing his borrow|ing at &s;uch a rate, might have the effect of le&s;&s;ening his di&s;tre&s;s, but could not have the effect of increa&s;ing it.</P>
<P>To put a &s;top to prodigality, if indeed it be worth while, I know but of one effectual cour&s;e that can be taken, in addition to the incomplete and in&s;ufficient cour&s;es at pre&s;ent practicable,
<PB N="29" REF="030057_0028_0FE41B14C58E9798">and that is, to put the convicted prodigal under an <HI>interdict,</HI> as was practi&s;ed formerly among the Romans, and is &s;till practi&s;ed among the French, and other nations who have taken the Roman law for the ground work of their own. But to di&s;cu&s;s the expediency, or &s;ketch out the details, of &s;uch an in&s;titution, belongs not to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e.</P>

<P>BESIDES prodigals, there are three other cla&s;&s;es of per&s;ons, and but three, for who&s;e &s;ecurity I can conceive the&s;e re&s;trictive laws to have been de&s;igned&mdash;I mean the indigent, the ra&s;hly enterprizing, and the &s;imple: tho&s;e who&s;e pecuniary nece&s;&s;ities may di&s;po&s;e them to give an intere&s;t above the ordinary rate, rather than not have it, and tho&s;e who, from ra&s;hne&s;s, may be di&s;po&s;ed to venture upon giving &s;uch a rate, or from carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, combined with ignorance, may be di&s;po&s;ed to acquie&s;ce in it.</P>
<P>In &s;peaking of the&s;e three different cla&s;&s;es of per&s;ons, I mu&s;t beg leave to con&s;ider one of them at a time: and accordingly, in &s;peaking of the indigent, I mu&s;t con&s;ider indigence, in the fir&s;t
<PB N="32" REF="030057_0030_0FE41B1964CEBEA8">place as untinctured with &s;implicity. On this occa&s;ion, I may &s;uppo&s;e, and ought to &s;uppo&s;e, no particular defect in a man's judgment, or his temper, that &s;hould mi&s;lead him, more than the ordinary run of men. He knows what is his intere&s;t as well as they do, and is as well di&s;po&s;ed and able to pur&s;ue it as they are.</P>
<P>I have already intimated, what I think is undeniable, that there are no one or two or other limited number of rates of intere&s;t, that can be equally &s;uited to the unlimited number of &s;ituations, in re&s;pect of the degree of <HI>exigency,</HI> in which a man is liable to find him&s;elf: in&s;omuch, that to the &s;ituation of a man, who, by the u&s;e of money can make, for example, eleven per cent. &s;ix per cent. is as well adapted, as five per cent. is to the &s;itu|ation of him who can make but ten; to that of him who can make twelve per cent. &s;even, and &s;o on. So, in the ca&s;e of his wanting it to &s;ave him&s;elf from a lo&s;s, (which is what is mo&s;t likely to be in view under the name of <HI>exigency</HI>)
<PB N="33" REF="030057_0031_0FE41B1B63E72980">if that lo&s;s would amount to eleven per cent. &s;ix per cent. is as well adapted to his &s;ituation, as five per cent. would be to the &s;ituation of him, who had but a lo&s;s amounting to ten per cent. to &s;ave him&s;elf from by the like means. And in any ca&s;e, though, in proportion to the amount of the lo&s;s, the rate of intere&s;t were even &s;o great, as the clear &s;aving &s;hould not amount to more than one per cent. or any fraction per cent.; yet &s;o long as it amounted to any thing, he would be ju&s;t &s;o much the better for borrowing, even on &s;uch comparatively di&s;advantageous terms. If, in&s;tead of gain, we put any other kind of benefit or advantage&mdash;if, in&s;tead of lo&s;s, we put any other kind of mi&s;chief or inconvenience, of equal value, the re&s;ult will be the &s;ame.</P>
<P>A man is in one of the&s;e &s;ituations, &s;uppo&s;e, in which it would be for his advantage to bor|row. But his circum&s;tances are &s;uch, that it would not be worth any body's while to lend him, at the highe&s;t rate which it is propo&s;ed the law &s;hould allow; in &s;hort, he cannot get it at
<PB N="34" REF="030057_0032_0FE41B1D0F59FA38">that rate. If he thought he <HI>could</HI> get it at that rate, mo&s;t &s;urely he would not give a higher; he may be tru&s;ted for that: for by the &s;uppo&s;i|tion, he has nothing defective in his under&s;tand|ing. But the fact is, he cannot get it at that lower rate. At a higher rate, however, he could get it: and at that rate, though higher, it would be worth his while to get it: &s;o he judges, who has nothing to hinder him from judging right; who has every motive and every means for forming a right judgment; who has every motive and every means for inform|ing him&s;elf of the circum&s;tances, upon which rectitude of judgment, in the ca&s;e in que&s;tion, depends.

<HEAD>LETTER V. <HI>Rea&s;ons for Re&s;traint.&mdash;Protection of Simplicity.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I COME, la&s;tly, to the ca&s;e of the &s;imple. Here, in the fir&s;t place, I think I am by this time entitled to ob&s;erve, that no &s;implicity, &s;hort of ab&s;olute idioti&s;m, can cau&s;e the individual to make a more groundle&s;s judgment, than the legi&s;lator, who, in the circum&s;tances above &s;ta|ted, &s;hould pretend to confine him to any given rate of intere&s;t, would have made for him.</P>
<P>Another con&s;ideration, equally conclu&s;ive, is, that were the legi&s;lator's judgment ever &s;o much &s;uperior to the individual's, how weak &s;oever that may be, the exertion of it on this occa&s;ion can never be any otherwi&s;e than u&s;ele&s;s, &s;o long as there are &s;o many &s;imilar occa&s;ions, as there ever mu&s;t be, where the &s;implicity of the indi|vidual is equally liable to make him a &s;ufferer,

<P>Buying goods with money, or upon credit, is the bu&s;ine&s;s of every day: borrowing money is the bu&s;ine&s;s, only, of &s;ome particular exigency, which, in compari&s;on, can occur but &s;eldom. Regulating the prices of goods in general would be an endle&s;s ta&s;k; and no legi&s;lator has ever been weak enough to think of attempting it. And &s;uppo&s;ing he were to regulate the prices, what would that &s;ignify for the protection of &s;implicity, unle&s;s he were to regulate al&s;o the quantum of what each man &s;hould buy? Such quantum is, indeed, regulated, or rather means are taken to prevent buying altogether; but in what ca&s;es? in tho&s;e only where the weakne&s;s is adjudged to have arrived at &s;uch a pitch, as to render a man utterly unqualified for the management of his affairs: in &s;hort, when it has arrived at the length of idiocy.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="030057_0037_0FE41B29603D8270">
But in what degree &s;oever a man's weakne&s;s may expo&s;e him to impo&s;ition, he &s;tands much more expo&s;ed to it, in the way of buying goods, than in the way of borrowing money. To be informed, beforehand, of the ordinary prices of all &s;orts of things, a man may have occa&s;ion to buy, may be a ta&s;k of con&s;iderable variety and extent. To be informed of the ordinary rate of intere&s;t, is to be informed of one &s;ingle fact, too intere&s;ting not to have attracted attention, and too &s;imple to have e&s;caped the memory. A few per cent. enhancement upon the price of goods, is a matter that may ea&s;ily enough pa&s;s unheed|ed; but a &s;ingle per cent. beyond the ordinary intere&s;t of money, is a &s;tride more con&s;picuous and &s;tartling, than many per cent. upon the price of any kind of goods.</P>
<P>Even in regard to &s;ubjects, which, by their importance, would, if any, ju&s;tify a regulation of their price, &s;uch as, for in&s;tance, land, I que&s;tion whether there ever was an in&s;tance where, without &s;ome &s;uch ground as, on the one &s;ide fraud, or &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of facts nece&s;&s;ary to

Were I to take a fancy to give a hundred years purcha&s;e in&s;tead of thirty, for a piece of land, rather than not have it, I do not think there is any court in England, or indeed any where el&s;e, that would interpo&s;e to hinder me, much le&s;s to puni&s;h the &s;eller with the lo&s;s of three times the purcha&s;e|money, as in the ca&s;e of u&s;ury. Yet when I had got my piece of land, and paid my money, repentance, were the law ever &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t me, might be unavailing: for the &s;eller might have &s;pent the money, or gone off with it. But, in the ca&s;e of borrowing money, it is the borrower always, who, according to the indefi|nite, or &s;hort term for which money is lent, is on the &s;afe &s;ide: any imprudence he may have committed with regard to the rate of intere&s;t, may be corrected at any time: if I find I have given too high an intere&s;t to one man, I have no more to do than to borrow of another at a lower rate, and pay off the fir&s;t: If I cannot

<HEAD>LETTER VI. <HI>Mi&s;chiefs of the anti-u&s;urious Laws.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the preceding letters, I have examined all the modes I can think of, in which the re|&s;traints, impo&s;ed by the laws again&s;t u&s;ury, can have been fancied to be of &s;ervice.</P>
<P>I hope it appears by this time, that there are no ways in which tho&s;e laws can do any good. But there are &s;everal, in which they cannot but do mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t, I &s;hall mention, is that of preclud|ing &s;o many people, altogether, from the getting the money they &s;tand in need of, to an&s;wer their re&s;pective exigencies. Think what a di&s;|tre&s;s it would produce, were the liberty of bor|rowing denied to every body; denied to tho&s;e who have &s;uch &s;ecurity to offer, as renders the
<PB N="44" REF="030057_0041_0FE41B32D1D258F0">rate of intere&s;t, they have to offer, a &s;ufficient inducement, for a man who has money, to tru&s;t them with it. Ju&s;t that &s;ame &s;ort of di&s;tre&s;s is produced, by denying that liberty to &s;o many people, who&s;e &s;ecurity, though, if they were permitted to add &s;omething to that rate, it would be &s;ufficient, is rendered in&s;ufficient by their be|ing denied that liberty. Why the misfortune, of not being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that arbitrarily exacted degree of &s;ecurity, &s;hould be made a ground for &s;ubjecting a man to a hard&s;hip, which is not impo&s;ed on tho&s;e who are free from that mis|fortune, is more than I can &s;ee. To di&s;crimi|nate the former cla&s;s from the latter, I can &s;ee but this one circum&s;tance, viz. that their nece&s;|&s;ity is greater. This it is by the very &s;uppo&s;ition: for were it not, they could not be, what they are &s;uppo&s;ed to be, willing to give more to be re|lieved from it. In this point of view, then, the &s;ole tendency of the law is, to heap di&s;tre&s;s upon di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>A &s;econd mi&s;chief is that of rendering the terms &s;o much the wor&s;e, to a multitude of tho&s;e,
<PB N="45" REF="030057_0042_0FE41AD04C079700">who&s;e circum&s;tances exempt them from being precluded altogether from getting the money they have occa&s;ion for. In this ca&s;e, the mi&s;|chief, though nece&s;&s;arily le&s;s inten&s;e than in the other, is much more palpable and con&s;picuous. Tho&s;e who cannot borrow, may get what they want, &s;o long as they have any thing to &s;ell. But while out of loving kindne&s;s, or what&s;oever other motive, the law precludes a man from <HI>borrowing,</HI> upon terms which it deems too di&s;|advantageous, it does not preclude him from <HI>&s;elling,</HI> upon any terms, however di&s;advantage|ous. Every body knows, that forced &s;ales are attended with lo&s;s: and to this lo&s;s, what would be deemed a mo&s;t extravagant intere&s;t bears in general no proportion. When a man's movea|bles are taken in execution, they are, I believe, pretty well &s;old, if, after all expences paid, the produce amounts to two thirds of what it would co&s;t to replace them. In this way the provi|dence and loving-kindne&s;s of the law co&s;ts him thirty-three per cent. and no more, &s;uppo&s;ing, what is&s;eldom the ca&s;e, that no more of the effects are taken than what is barely nece&s;&s;ary to make up
<PB N="46" REF="030057_0043_0FE41AD25091D628">the money due. If, in her negligence and weak|ne&s;s, &s;he were to &s;uffer him to offer eleven per cent. per ann. for forbearance, it would be three years before he paid what he is charged with, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, by her wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>Such being the kindne&s;s done by the law to the owner of moveables, let us &s;ee how it fares with him who has an intere&s;t in immoveables. Be|fore the late war, thirty years' purcha&s;e for land might be reckoned, I think it is pretty well agreed, a medium price. During the di&s;tre&s;s produced by the war, lands which it was nece&s;|&s;ary &s;hould be &s;old, were &s;old at twenty, eigh|teen, nay, I believe, in &s;ome in&s;tances, even &s;o low as fifteen years' purcha&s;e. If I do not mi&s;|recollect, I remember in&s;tances of lands put up to public auction, for which no body bid &s;o high as fifteen. In many in&s;tances, villas, which had been bought before the war, or at the be|ginning of it, and, in the interval, had been improved, rather than impaired, &s;old for le&s;s than half, or even the quarter, of what they had been bought for. I dare not here for my part pretend to be exact: but
<PB N="47" REF="030057_0044_0FE41AD764A55900">on this pa&s;&s;age, were it worth their notice, Mr. Skinner, or Mr. Chri&s;tie, could furni&s;h very in&s;tructive notes. Twenty years' purcha&s;e, in|&s;tead of thirty, I may be allowed to take, at lea&s;t for illu&s;tration. An e&s;tate then of 100<ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year, clear of taxes, was devi&s;ed to a man, charg|ed, &s;uppo&s;e, with 1500<ABBR>l.</ABBR> with intere&s;t till the money &s;hould be paid. Five per cent. intere&s;t, the utmo&s;t which could be accepted from the owner, did not an&s;wer the incumbrancer's pur|po&s;e: he cho&s;e to have the money. But &s;ix per cent. perhaps, would have an&s;wered his purpo&s;e; if not, mo&s;t certainly it would have an&s;wered the purpo&s;e of &s;omebody el&s;e: for multitudes there all along were, who&s;e purpo&s;es were an|&s;wered by five per cent. The war la&s;ted, I think, &s;even years: the depreciation of the va|lue of land did not take place immediately: but as, on the other hand, neither did it immedi|ately recover its former price upon the peace, if indeed it has even yet recovered it, we may put &s;even years for the time, during which it would be more advantageous to pay this extraor|dinary rate of intere&s;t than &s;ell the land, and during which, accordingly, this extraordi|nary

<P>What I have &s;aid hitherto, is confined to the ca&s;e of tho&s;e who have pre&s;ent value to give, for the money they &s;tand in need of. If they have no &s;uch value, then, if they &s;ucceed in purcha|&s;ing a&s;&s;i&s;tance upon any terms, it mu&s;t be a breach of the law; their lenders expo&s;ing them&s;elves to its vengeance: for I &s;peak not here of the acci|dental ca&s;e, of its being &s;o con&s;tructed as to be liable to eva&s;ion. But, even in this ca&s;e, the mi&s;chievous influence of the law &s;till pur&s;ues them; aggravating the very mi&s;chief it pre|tends to remedy. Though it be inefficacious in the way in which the legi&s;lator wi&s;hes to &s;ee it efficacious, it is efficacious in the way oppo&s;ite to that in which he would wi&s;h to &s;ee it &s;o. The effect of it is, to rai&s;e the rate of intere&s;t, higher than it would be otherwi&s;e, and that in two ways.
<PB N="50" REF="030057_0047_0FE41B38291EC778">In the fir&s;t place, a man mu&s;t, in common pru|dence, as Dr. Smith ob&s;erves, make a point of being indemnified, not only for what&s;oever ex|traordinary ri&s;k it is that he runs independently of the law, but for the very ri&s;k occa&s;ioned by the law: he mu&s;t be <HI>in&s;ured,</HI> as it were, again&s;t the law. This cau&s;e would operate, were there even as many per&s;ons ready to lend upon the illegal rate, as upon the legal. But this is not the ca&s;e: a great number of per&s;ons are, of cour&s;e, driven out of this competition, by the danger of the bu&s;ine&s;s; and another great number, by the di&s;repute which, under cover of the&s;e prohibitory laws or otherwi&s;e, has fa&s;tened it&s;elf upon the name of u&s;urer. So many per&s;ons, therefore, being driven out of the trade, it happens in this branch, as it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily in every other, that tho&s;e who remain have the le&s;s to withhold them from advancing their terms; and without confederating, (for it mu&s;t be allowed that con|federacy in &s;uch a ca&s;e is plainly impo&s;&s;ible) each one will find it ea&s;ier to pu&s;h his advantage up to any given degree of exorbitancy, than he would,

<P>As to the ca&s;e, where the law is &s;o worded as to be liable to be evaded, in this ca&s;e it is partly inefficacious and nugatory, and partly mi&s;chie|vous. It is nugatory, as to all &s;uch, who&s;e con|fidence of its being &s;o is perfect: it is mi&s;chievous, as before, in regard to all &s;uch who fail of po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing that perfect confidence. If the borrower can find nobody at all who has confidence enough to take advantage of the flaw, he &s;tands precluded from all a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as before: and, though he &s;hould, yet the lender's terms mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily run the higher, in proportion to what his confidence wants of being perfect. It is not likely that it &s;hould be perfect: it is &s;till le&s;s likely that he &s;hould acknowledge it &s;o to be: it is not likely, at lea&s;t as matters &s;tand in England, that the wor&s;t-penned law made for this purpo&s;e &s;hould be altogether de&s;titute of effect: and while it has any, that effect, we &s;ee, mu&s;t be in one way or other mi&s;chievous.</P>

I have already hinted at the di&s;repute, the ignominy, the reproach, which prejudice, the cau&s;e and the effect of the&s;e re&s;trictive laws, has heaped upon that perfectly innocent and even meri|torious cla&s;s of men, who, not more for their own advantage than to the relief of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of their neighbour, may have ventured to break through the&s;e re&s;traints. It is certainly not a matter of indifference, that a cla&s;s of per&s;ons, who, in every point of view in which their con|duct can be placed, whether in relation to their own intere&s;t, or in relation to that of the per|&s;ons whom they have to deal with, as well on the &s;core of prudence, as on that of beneficence, (and of what u&s;e is even benevolence, but in as far as it is productive of beneficence?) de&s;erve prai&s;e rather than cen&s;ure, &s;hould be cla&s;&s;ed with the abandoned and profligate, and loaded with a degree of infamy, which is due to tho&s;e only who&s;e conduct is in its tendency the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to their own.</P>
<P>"This &s;uffering," it may be &s;aid, "having already been taken account of, is not to be

True: but is it &s;ure that the com|pen&s;ation, &s;uch as it is, will always, in the event, have proved a &s;ufficient one? Is there no room here for mi&s;calculation? May there not be un|expected, unlooked-for incidents, &s;ufficient to turn into bitterne&s;s the utmo&s;t &s;atisfaction which the difference of pecuniary emolument could afford? For who can &s;ee to the end of that inexhau&s;tible train of con&s;equences that are liable to en&s;ue from the lo&s;s of reputation? Who can fathom the aby&s;s of infamy? At any rate, this article of mi&s;chief, if not an addition in its quan|tity to the others above noticed, is at lea&s;t di&s;|tinct from them in its nature, and as &s;uch ought not to be overlooked.</P>
<P>Nor is the event of the execution of the law by any means an unexampled one: &s;everal &s;uch, at different times, have fallen within my notice.

<P>The la&s;t article I have to mention in the account of mi&s;chief, is, the corruptive influence, exerci&s;ed by the&s;e laws, on the morals of the people; by the pains they take, and cannot but take, to give birth to treachery and ingratitude. To purcha&s;e a po&s;&s;ibility of being enforced, the law neither has found, nor, what is very mate|rial, mu&s;t it ever hope to find, in this ca&s;e, any other expedient, than that of hiring a man to break his engagement, and to cru&s;h the hand that has been reached out to help him. In the ca&s;e of informers in general, there has been no troth plighted, nor benefit received. In the ca&s;e of real criminals invited by rewards to inform again&s;t accomplices, it is by &s;uch <HI>breach</HI> of faith that &s;ociety is held together, as in other ca&s;es by the <HI>ob&s;ervance</HI> of it.

<HEAD>LETTER VII. <HI>Inefficacy of anti-u&s;urious Laws.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I quit altogether the con&s;idera|tion of the ca&s;e in which a law, made for the purpo&s;e of limiting the rate of intere&s;t, may be inefficacious with regard to that end, I cannot forbear taking &s;ome further notice of a pa&s;&s;age already alluded to, of Dr. Smith's: becau&s;e, to my apprehen&s;ion, that pa&s;&s;age &s;eems to throw upon the &s;ubject a degree of ob&s;curity, which I could wi&s;h to &s;ee cleared up, in a future edition of that valuable work.</P>
<P>"No law," (&s;ays he, b. ii. ch. 10. vol. ii. p. 45. edit. 8vo. 1784,) <Q>can reduce the common rate of intere&s;t below the lowe&s;t ordinary market rate, at the time when that law was made. Notwith&s;tanding the edict of 1766, by which the French king attempted to re|duce
<PB N="58" REF="030057_0054_0FE41B44CC69E6F8">the rate of intere&s;t from five to four per cent. money continued to be lent in France at five per cent. the law being evaded in &s;everal different ways.</Q></P>
<P>As to the general po&s;ition, if &s;o it be, &s;o much, according to me, the better: but I mu&s;t cenfe&s;s I do not &s;ee why this &s;hould be the ca&s;e. It is for the purpo&s;e of proving the truth of this general po&s;ition, that the fact of the inefficacy of this attempt &s;eems to be adduced: for no other proof is adduced but this. But, taking the fact for granted, I do not &s;ee how it can be &s;ufficient to &s;upport the inference. The law, we are told at the &s;ame time, was evaded: but we are not told how it came to be open to eva&s;ion. It might be owing to a particular defect in the penning of that particular law; or, what comes to the &s;ame thing, in the provi&s;ions made for carrying it into execution. In either ca&s;e, it affords no &s;upport to the general po&s;ition: nor can that po&s;ition be a ju&s;t one, unle&s;s it were &s;o in the ca&s;e where every provi&s;ion had been made, that could be made, for giving efficacy to the law.
<PB N="59" REF="030057_0055_0FE41B46BABE96E8">For the po&s;ition to be true, the ca&s;e mu&s;t be, that the law would &s;till be broken, even after every means of what can properly be called <HI>eva&s;ion</HI> had been removed. True or untrue, the po&s;ition is certainly not &s;elf-evident enough to be received without proof: yet nothing is adduced in proof of it, but the fact above no|ticed, which, we &s;ee, amounts to no &s;uch thing. What is more, I &s;hould not expect to find it capable of proof. I do not &s;ee what it is, that &s;hould render the law incapable of "reducing the common rate of intere&s;t below the lowe&s;t ordinary market rate," but &s;uch a &s;tate of things, &s;uch a combination of circum&s;tances, as &s;hould afford ob&s;tacles equally powerful, or nearly &s;o, to the efficacy of the law again&s;t all higher rates. For de&s;troying the efficacy of the law altogether, I know nothing that could &s;erve, but a re&s;olu|tion on the part of all per&s;ons any way privy not to inform: but by &s;uch a re&s;olution any higher rate is ju&s;t as effectually protected as any lower one. Suppo&s;e it, &s;trictly &s;peaking, univer&s;al, and the law mu&s;t, in all in&s;tances, be equally inefficacious; all rates of intere&s;t are equally
<PB N="60" REF="030057_0056_0FE41B48BA3513C8">free; and the &s;tate of men's dealings in this way ju&s;t what it would be, were there no law at all upon the &s;ubject. But in this ca&s;e, the po&s;ition, in as far as it limits the inefficacy of the law to tho&s;e rates which are below the "lowe&s;t ordi|nary market rate," is not true. For my part, I cannot conceive how any &s;uch univer&s;al re&s;o|lution could have been maintained, or could ever be maintained, without an open concert, and as open a rebellion again&s;t government; nothing of which &s;ort appears to have taken place: and, as to any particular confederacies, they are as capable of protecting any higher rates again&s;t the prohibition, as any lower ones.</P>
<P>Thus much indeed mu&s;t be admitted, that the low rate in que&s;tion, viz. that which was the lowe&s;t ordinary market rate immediately before the making of the law, is likely to come in for the protection of the public again&s;t the law, more frequently than any other rate. That mu&s;t be the ca&s;e on two accounts: fir&s;t, becau&s;e, by be|ing of the number of the ordinary rates, it was, by the &s;uppo&s;ition, more frequent than any ex|traordinary
<PB N="61" REF="030057_0057_0FE41B4A66E3EEC0">ones: &s;econdly, becau&s;e the di&s;|repute annexed to the idea of u&s;ury, a force which might have more or le&s;s efficacy in ex|cluding, from the protection above &s;poken of, &s;uch extraordinary rates, cannot well be &s;up|po&s;ed to apply it&s;elf, or at lea&s;t not in equal degree, to this low and ordinary rate. A lender has certainly le&s;s to &s;top him from taking a rate, which may be taken without di&s;repute, than from taking one, which a man could not take without &s;ubjecting him&s;elf to that inconvenience: nor is it likely, that men's imaginations and &s;entiments &s;hould te&s;tify &s;o &s;udden an ob&s;equi|ou&s;ne&s;s to the law, as to &s;tamp di&s;repute to-day, upon a rate of intere&s;t, to which no &s;uch accom|paniment had &s;tood annexed the day before.</P>
<P>Were I to be a&s;ked how I imagined the ca&s;e &s;tood in the particular in&s;tance referred to by Dr. Smith; judging from his account of it, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by general probabilities, I &s;hould an&s;wer thus:&mdash;The law, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, was not &s;o penned as to be altogether proof again&s;t eva&s;ion. In many in&s;tances, of which it is impo&s;&s;ible any
<PB N="62" REF="030057_0058_0FE41B4E1C2D8040">account &s;hould have been taken, it was indeed conformed to: in &s;ome of tho&s;e in&s;tances, people who would have lent otherwi&s;e, ab&s;tained from lending altogether; in others of tho&s;e in&s;tances, people lent their money at the reduced legal rate. In other in&s;tances again, the law was broken: the lenders tru&s;ting, partly to expedi|dients recurred to for evading it, partly to the good faith and honour of tho&s;e whom they had to deal with: in this cla&s;s of in&s;tances it was natural for the two rea&s;ons above &s;ugge&s;ted, that tho&s;e where the old legal rate was adhered to, &s;hould have been the mo&s;t numerous. From the circum&s;tance not only of their num|ber, but of their more direct repugnancy to the particular recent law in que&s;tion, they would na|turally be the mo&s;t taken notice of. And this, probably, was the foundation in point of fact for the Doctor's general po&s;ition above men|tioned, that "no law <HI>can</HI> reduce the common rate of intere&s;t below the lowe&s;t ordinary mar|ket rate, at the time when that law was made."</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="030057_0059_0FE41ADB0D7F7D78">
In England, as far as I can tru&s;t my judg|ment and imperfect general recollection of the purport of the laws relative to this matter, I &s;hould not &s;uppo&s;e that the above po&s;i|tion would prove true. That there is no &s;uch thing as any palpable and univer&s;ally notorious, as well as univer&s;ally practicable receipt for that purpo&s;e, is manife&s;t from the examples, which, as I have already mentioned, every now and then occur, of convictions upon the&s;e &s;ta|tutes. Two &s;uch receipts, indeed, I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to touch upon pre&s;ently: but they are either not obvious enough in their nature, or too trouble&s;ome or not exten&s;ive enough in their application, to have de&s;poiled the law altogether of its terrors or of its preventive efficacy.</P>
<P>In the country in which I am writing, the whole &s;y&s;tem of laws on this &s;ubject is perfectly, and very happily, inefficacious. The rate fixed by law is five per cent.: many people lend money; and nobody at that rate: the lowe&s;t ordinary rate, upon the very be&s;t real &s;ecurity, is eight per cent.: nine, and even ten, upon &s;uch &s;ecu|rity,
<PB N="64" REF="030057_0060_0FE41B4FC9608340" MS="y">are common. Six or &s;even may have place, now and then, between relations or other par|ticular friends: becau&s;e, now and then, a man may choo&s;e to make a pre&s;ent of one or two per cent. to a per&s;on whom he means to favour. The contract is renewed from year to year: for a thou&s;and roubles, the borrower in his written contract, obliges him&s;elf to pay at the end of the year one thou&s;and and fifty. Before wit|ne&s;&s;es, he receives his thou&s;and roubles: and, without witne&s;&s;es, he immediately pays back his thirty roubles, or his forty roubles, or whatever the &s;um may be, that is nece&s;&s;ary to bring the real rate of intere&s;t to the rate verbally agreed on.</P>
<P>This contrivance, I take it, would not do in England: but why it would not, is a que&s;tion which it would be in vain for me to pretend, at this di&s;tance from all authorities, to di&s;cu&s;s.</P>

<P>HAVING proved, as I hope, by this time, the utter impropriety of the law's limiting the rate of intere&s;t, in every ca&s;e that can be con|ceived, it may be rather a matter of curio&s;ity, than any thing el&s;e, to enquire, how far the law, on this head, is con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf, and with any principles upon which it can have built.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Drawing and re-drawing</HI> is a practice, which it will be &s;ufficient here to hint at. It is perfectly well known to all merchants, and may be &s;o to all who are not merchants, by con&s;ulting Dr. Smith. In this way he was &s;hewn how money may be, and has been, taken up, at &s;o high a rate, as thirteen or fourteen per cent. a rate nearly three times as high as the utmo&s;t which the law profe&s;&s;es to allow. The extra
<PB N="99" REF="030057_0062_0FE41B537B5C8C68">intere&s;t is in this ca&s;e ma&s;ked under the names of <HI>commi&s;&s;ion,</HI> and price of <HI>exchange.</HI> The commi&s;|&s;ion is but &s;mall upon each loan, not more, I think, than one half per cent.: cu&s;tom having &s;tretched &s;o far, but no farther, it might be thought dangerous, perhaps, to venture upon any higher allowance under that name. The charge, being repeated a number of times in the cour&s;e of the year, makes up in frequency what it wants in weight. The tran&s;action is by this &s;hift rendered more trouble&s;ome, indeed, but not le&s;s practicable, to &s;uch parties as are agreed about it. But if u&s;ury is good for merchants, I do not very well &s;ee what &s;hould make it bad for every body el&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. At this di&s;tance from all the fountains of legal knowledge, I will not pretend to &s;ay, whe|ther the practice of <HI>&s;elling accepted bills</HI> at an under value, would hold good again&s;t all attacks. It &s;trikes my recollection as a pretty common one, and I think it could not be brought under any of the penal &s;tatutes again&s;t u&s;ury. The adequatene&s;s of the con&s;ideration might, for
<PB N="67" REF="030057_0063_0FE41B565FA32AB8">aught I know, be attacked with &s;ucce&s;s, in a court of equity; or, perhaps, if there were &s;uffi|cient evidence (which the agreement of the parties might ea&s;ily prevent) by an action at common law, for money had and received. If the practice be really proof again&s;t all attacks, it &s;eems to afford an effectual, and pretty com|modious method of evading the re&s;trictive laws. The only re&s;traint is, that it requires the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of a third per&s;on, a friend of the borrow|er's; as, for in&s;tance: B, the real borrower, wants 100<ABBR>l.</ABBR> and finds U, a u&s;urer, who is wil|ling to lend it to him, at ten per cent. B. has F, a friend, who has not the money him&s;elf to lend him, but is willing to &s;tand &s;ecurity for him, to that amount. B. therefore, draws upon F, and F. accepts a bill of 100<ABBR>l.</ABBR> at five per cent. intere&s;t, payable at the end of a twelve-month from the date. F. draws a like bill upon B.: each &s;ells his bill to U. for fifty pounds; and it is endor&s;ed to U. accordingly. The 50<ABBR>l.</ABBR> that F. receives, he delivers over without any con&s;ideration to B. This tran&s;action, if it be a valid one, and if a man can find &s;uch a friend,
<PB N="68" REF="030057_0064_0FE41B58692543A0">is evidently much le&s;s trouble&s;ome than the practice of drawing and re-drawing. And this, if it be practicable at all, may be practi&s;ed by per&s;ons of any de&s;cription, concerned or not in trade. Should the effect of this page be to &s;ug|ge&s;t an expedient, and that a &s;afe and commo|dious one, for evading the laws again&s;t u&s;ury, to &s;ome, to whom &s;uch an expedient might not otherwi&s;e have occurred, it will not lie very heavy upon my con&s;cience. The prayers of u&s;urers, whatever efficacy they may have in lightening the burden, I hope I may lay &s;ome claim to. And I think you will not now won|der at my &s;aying, that in the efficacy of &s;uch prayers I have not a whit le&s;s confidence, than in that of the prayers of any other cla&s;s of men.</P>
<P>One apology I &s;hall have to plead at any rate, that in pointing out the&s;e &s;laws, to the indivi|dual who may be di&s;po&s;ed to creep out at them, I point them out at the &s;ame time to the legi&s;|lator, in who&s;e power it is to &s;top them up, if in his opinion they require it.

<P>The&s;e, it may be &s;aid, &s;hould they even be &s;ecure and effectual eva&s;ions, are &s;till but eva|&s;ions, and, if chargeable upon the law at all, are chargeable not as incon&s;i&s;tencies but as over|&s;ights. Be it &s;o. Setting the&s;e a&s;ide, then, as expedients practi&s;ed or practicable, only behind its back, I will beg leave to remind you of two others, practi&s;ed from time to time, under its pro|tection and before its face.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t I &s;hall mention is <HI>pawn-broking.</HI> In this ca&s;e there is the le&s;s pretence for more than ordinary intere&s;t, ina&s;much as the &s;ecurity is, in this ca&s;e, not only equal to, but better than, what it can be in any other: to wit, the pre|&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a moveable thing, of ea&s;y &s;ale, on which the creditor has the power, and cer|tainly does not want the inclination, to &s;et &s;uch price as is mo&s;t for his advantage. If there be a ca&s;e in which the allowing of &s;uch extraordi|nary intere&s;t is attended with more danger than
<PB N="70" REF="030057_0066_0FE41B5C0F608218">another, it mu&s;t be this; which is &s;o particularly adapted to the &s;ituation of the lowe&s;t poor, that is, of tho&s;e who, on the &s;core of indigence or &s;implicity, or both, are mo&s;t open to impo&s;ition. This trade, however, the law, by regulating, avowedly protects. What the rate of intere&s;t is, which it allows to be taken in this way, I can|not take upon me to remember: but I am much deceived, if it amounts to le&s;s than twelve per cent. in the year, and I believe it amounts to a good deal more. Whether it were twelve per cent. or twelve hundred, I believe would make in practice but little difference. What <HI>commi&s;&s;ion</HI> is in the bu&s;ine&s;s of drawing and re-drawing, <HI>ware-hou&s;e room</HI> is, in that of pawnbrok|ing. Whatever limits then are &s;et to the profits of this trade, are &s;et, perhaps, not by the vi|gilancy of the law, but, as in the ca&s;e of other trades, by the competition among&s;t the traders. Of the other regulations contained in the acts relative to this &s;ubject I recollect no rea&s;on to doubt the u&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="030057_0067_0FE41B601C589F50">
The other in&s;tance is that of <HI>bottomry</HI> and <HI>re&s;pondentia:</HI> for the two tran&s;actions, being &s;o nearly related, may be &s;poken of together. Bot|tomry is the u&s;ury of pawnbroking: re&s;pon|dentia is u&s;ury at large, but combined in a man|ner with in&s;urance, and employed in the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of a trade carried on by &s;ea. If any &s;pe|cies of u&s;ury is to be condemned, I &s;ee not on what grounds this particular &s;pecies can be &s;creen|ed from the condemnation. "O but" (&s;ays Sir William Black&s;tone, or any body el&s;e who takes upon him&s;elf the ta&s;k of finding a rea&s;on for the law) "this is a maritime country, and the trade, which it carries on by &s;ea, is the great bulwark of its defence." It is not nece&s;&s;ary I &s;hould here enquire, whether that branch, which, as Dr. Smith has &s;hewn, is, in every view, but the mere one of defence, le&s;s beneficial to a na|tion, than two others out of the four branches which comprehend all trade, has any claim to be preferred to them in this or any other way. I admit, that the liberty which this branch of trade enjoys, is no more than what it is perfectly right it &s;hould enjoy. What I want to know is,
<PB N="72" REF="030057_0068_0FE41B61C8543F78">what there is in the cla&s;s of men, embarked in this trade, that &s;hould render beneficial to them, a liberty, which would be ruinous to every body el&s;e. Is it that &s;ea adventures have le&s;s hazard in them than land adventures? or that the &s;ea teaches tho&s;e, who have to deal with it, a de|gree of foreca&s;t and reflection which has been denied to landmen?</P>
<P>It were ea&s;y enough to give farther and far|ther exten&s;ion to this charge of incon&s;i&s;tency, by bringing under it the liberty given to in&s;u|rance in all its branches, to the purcha&s;e and &s;ale of annuities, and of <HI>po&s;t-obits,</HI> in a word, to all ca&s;es where a man is permitted to take upon him&s;elf an unlimited degree of ri&s;k, receiving, for &s;o doing, an unlimited compen&s;ation. In|deed I know not where the want of in&s;tances would &s;top me: for in what part of the maga|zine of events, about which human tran&s;actions are conver&s;ant, is certainty to be found?

<HEAD>LETTER IX. <HI>Black&s;tone con&s;idered.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I HOPE you are, by this time, at lea&s;t, pretty much of my opinion, that there is ju&s;t the &s;ame &s;ort of harm, and no other, in making the be&s;t terms one can for one's &s;elf in a money loan, as there is in any other &s;ort of bargain. If you are not, Black&s;tone, however, is, who&s;e opinion I hope you will allow to be worth &s;omething. In &s;peaking of the rate of intere&s;t, (b. ii. ch. 13.) he &s;tarts a parallel between a bargain for the loan of money, and a bargain about a hor&s;e, and pronounces, without he&s;ita|tion, that the harm of making too good a bar|gain, is ju&s;t as great in the one ca&s;e, as in the other. As money-lending, and not hor&s;e-deal|ing, was, what you lawyers call, the <HI>principal ca&s;e,</HI> he drops the hor&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s, as &s;oon as it has an&s;wered the purpo&s;e of illu&s;tration, which
<PB N="76" REF="030057_0071_0FE41B698BD0CF90">it was brought to &s;erve. But as, in my con|ception, as well the rea&s;oning by which he &s;up|ports the deci&s;ion, as that by which any body el&s;e could have &s;upported it, is ju&s;t as applica|ble to the one &s;ort of bargain as to the other, I will carry on the parallel a little farther, and give the &s;ame extent to the rea&s;oning, as to the po&s;ition which it is made u&s;e of to &s;upport. This exten&s;ion will not be without its u&s;e: for if the po&s;ition, when thus extended, &s;hould be &s;ound ju&s;t, a practical inference will ari&s;e; which is, that the benefits of the&s;e re&s;traints ought to be extended from the money-trade to the hor&s;e|trade. That my own opinion is not favourable to &s;uch re&s;traints in either ca&s;e, has been &s;uffici|ently declared; but if more re&s;pectable opinions than mine are &s;till to prevail, they will not be le&s;s re&s;pectable for being con&s;i&s;tent.</P>
<P>The &s;ort of bargain which the learned com|mentator has happened to pitch upon for the illu&s;tration, is, indeed, in the ca&s;e illu&s;trating, as in the ca&s;e illu&s;trated, a loan: but as, to my apprchen&s;ion, loan or &s;ale makes, in point of
<PB N="77" REF="030057_0072_0FE41B6B32757B00">rea&s;oning, no &s;ort of difference; and as the uti|lity of the conclu&s;ion will, in the latter ca&s;e, be more exten&s;ive, I &s;hall adapt the rea&s;oning to the more important bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;elling hor&s;es, in&s;tead of the le&s;s important one of lending them.</P>
<P>A circum&s;tance that would render the exten|&s;ion of the&s;e re&s;traints to the hor&s;e trade more &s;mooth and ea&s;y, is, that in the one track, as well as in the other, the public has already got the length of calling names. <HI>Jockey-&s;hip,</HI> a term of reproach not le&s;s frequently applied to the arts of tho&s;e who &s;ell hor&s;es than to the arts of tho&s;e who ride them, &s;ounds, I take it, to the ear of many a worthy gentleman, nearly as had as <HI>u&s;ury:</HI> and it is well known to all tho&s;e who put their tru&s;t in proverbs, and not le&s;s to tho&s;e who put their tru&s;t in party, that when we have got a dog to hang who is trouble&s;ome and keeps us at bay, whoever can contrive to fa&s;ten a bad name to his tail, has gained more than half the battle. I now pro|ceed with my application. The words in <HI>Italics</HI>
<PB N="78" REF="030057_0073_0FE41B6D316A19C8">are my own: all the re&s;t are Sir William Black&s;tone's: and I re&s;tore, (in parenthe&s;es) the words I was obliged to di&s;card, in order to make room for mine.</P>
<P>"To demand an exorbitant price is equally contrary to con&s;cience, for the loan of a hor&s;e, or for the loan of a &s;um of money: but a rea|&s;onable equivalent for the temporary inconveni|ence, which the owner may feel by the want of it, and for the hazard of his lo&s;ing it entirely, is not more immoral in one ca&s;e, than in the other. * * * *</P>
<P><HI>"As to &s;elling hor&s;es,</HI> a capital di&s;tinction mu&s;t be made, between a moderate and an exorbitant profit: to the former of which we give the name of <HI>hor&s;e dealing,</HI> (intere&s;t) to the latter the truly odious appellation of <HI>jockey-&s;hip,</HI> (u&s;ury): the former is nece&s;&s;ary in every civil &s;tate, if it were but to exclude the latter. For, as the whole of this matter is well &s;ummed up by Grotius, if the compen&s;ation allowed by law does not exceed the proportion of the <HI>inconvenience which it is to
<PB N="79" REF="030057_0074_0FE41B6EDA84C5C8">the &s;eller of the hor&s;e to part with it,</HI> (hazard run) or the want <HI>which the buyer has of it,</HI> (felt by the loan) its allowance is neither repugnant to the revealed law, nor to the natural law: but if it exceeds the&s;e bounds, it is then an oppre&s;&s;ive <HI>jockey &s;hip,</HI> (u&s;ury): and though the municipal laws may give it impunity, they never can make it ju&s;t.</P>
<P>"We &s;ee that the exorbitance or moderation of <HI>the price given for a hor&s;e</HI> (intere&s;t for the money lent) depends upon two circum&s;tances: upon the inconvenience of parting with <HI>the hor&s;e one has,</HI> (it for the pre&s;ent) and the hazard of <HI>not being able to meet with &s;uch another</HI> (lo&s;ing it entirely). The inconvenience to individual <HI>&s;ellers of hor&s;es</HI> (lenders), can never be e&s;tima|ted by laws; the <HI>general price for hor&s;es,</HI> (rate of general intere&s;t) mu&s;t depend therefore upon the u&s;ual or general inconvenience. This re&s;ults entirely from the quantity of <HI>hor&s;es</HI> (money) in the kingdom: for the more <HI>hor&s;es</HI> (&s;pecie) there are <HI>running about</HI> (circulating) in any nation, the greater &s;uperfluity there will be beyond what is
<PB N="80" REF="030057_0075_0FE41B740E560F28">nece&s;&s;ary to carry on the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>the mail coaches</HI> (exchange) and the common concerns of life. In every nation or public community, there is a certain quantity of <HI>hor&s;es</HI> (money) then ne|ce&s;&s;ary, which a per&s;on well &s;killed in political arithmetic might, perhaps, calculate as exactly as a private <HI>hor&s;e dealer</HI> (banker) can the demand for the running <HI>hor&s;es in his own &s;tables</HI> (ca&s;h in his own &s;hop): all above this nece&s;&s;ary quantity may be &s;pared, or lent, <HI>or &s;old,</HI> without much inconvenience to the re&s;pective lenders <HI>or &s;ellers:</HI> and the greater the national &s;uperfluity is, the more numerous will be the <HI>&s;ellers</HI> (lenders), and the lower ought <HI>the national price of hor&s;e fle&s;h</HI> (the rate of the national intere&s;t) to be: but where there are not enough, or barely enough <HI>&s;pare hor&s;es</HI> (circulating ca&s;h) to an&s;wer the or|dinary u&s;es of the public, <HI>hor&s;e fle&s;h</HI> (intere&s;t) will be proportionably high: for <HI>&s;ellers</HI> (lend|ers) will be but few, as few can &s;ubmit to the inconvenience of <HI>&s;elling"</HI> (lending).&mdash;So far the learned commentator.</P>

I hope, by this time, you are worked up to a proper pitch of indignation, at the neglect and incon&s;i&s;tency betrayed by the law, in not &s;up|pre&s;&s;ing this &s;pecies of jockey-&s;hip, which it would be &s;o ea&s;y to do, only by fixing the price of hor&s;es.

<HEAD>LETTER X. <HI>Grounds of the Prejudices again&s;t U&s;ury.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is one thing, to find rea&s;ons why it is <HI>fit</HI> a law <HI>&s;hould</HI> have been made: it is another, to find the rea&s;ons why it <HI>was</HI> made: in other words, it is one thing to ju&s;tify a law: it is ano|ther thing to account for its exi&s;tence. In the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, the former ta&s;k, if the ob&s;er|vations I have been troubling you with are ju&s;t, is an impo&s;&s;ible one. The other, though not nece&s;&s;ary for conviction, may contribute &s;ome|thing perhaps in the way of &s;atisfaction. To trace an error to its fountain head, &s;ays Lord Coke, is to refute it; and many men there are, who, till they have received this &s;atisfaction, be the error what it may, cannot prevail upon them&s;elves ro part with it. "If our ance&s;tors have been all along under a mi&s;take, how came they to have fallen into it?" is a que&s;tion that
<PB N="84" REF="030057_0079_0FE41B7DB6269450">naturally pre&s;ents it&s;elf upon &s;uch occa&s;ions. The ca&s;e is, that in matters of law more e&s;pe|cially, &s;uch is the dominion of authority over our minds, and &s;uch the prejudice it creates in favour of whatever in&s;titution it has taken under its wing, that, after all manner of rea&s;ons that can be thought of, in favour of the in&s;titution, have been &s;hewn to be in&s;ufficient, we &s;till cannot forbear looking to &s;ome una&s;&s;ignable and latent rea&s;on for its efficient cau&s;e. But if, in&s;tead of any &s;uch rea&s;on, we can find a cau&s;e for it in &s;ome notion, of the erroneou&s;ne&s;s of which we are already &s;atisfied, then at la&s;t we are content to give it up without further &s;truggle; and then, and not till then, our &s;atisfaction is compleat.</P>
<P>In the conceptions of the more con&s;iderable part of tho&s;e through whom our religion has been handed down to us, virtue, or rather godli|ne&s;s, which was an improved &s;ub&s;titute for vir|tue, con&s;i&s;ted in &s;elf-denial: not in &s;elf-denial for the &s;ake of &s;ociety, but of &s;elf-denial for its own &s;ake. One pretty general rule &s;erved for mo&s;t occa&s;ions: not to do what you had a mind
<PB N="85" REF="030057_0080_0FE41B7F61107A40">to do; or, in other words, not to do what would be for your advantage. By this, of cour&s;e, was meant temporal advantage: to which &s;pi|ritual advantage was under&s;tood to be in con|&s;tant and diametrical oppo&s;ition. For, the proof of a re&s;olution, on the part of a being of perfect power and benevolence, to make his few favour|ites happy in a &s;tate in which they <HI>were to be,</HI> was his determined plea&s;ure, that they &s;hould keep them&s;elves as much &s;trangers to happine&s;s as po&s;&s;ible, in a &s;tate in which they <HI>were.</HI> Now to get money is what mo&s;t men have a mind to do: becau&s;e he who has money, gets, as far as it goes, mo&s;t other things that he has a mind for. Of cour&s;e, nobody was to get money: indeed, why &s;hould he, when he was not &s;o much as to keep what he had got already? To lend money at intere&s;t, is to get money, or at lea&s;t to try to get it: of cour&s;e, it was a bad thing to lend money upon &s;uch terms. The better the terms, the wor&s;e it was to lend upon them: but it was bad to lend upon any terms, by which any thing could be got. What made it much the wor&s;e was, that it was acting like a Jew: for
<PB N="86" REF="030057_0081_0FE41B8186BA1B60">though all Chri&s;tians at fir&s;t were Jews, and continued to do as Jews did, after they had become Chri&s;tians, yet, in proce&s;s of time, it came to be di&s;covered, that the di&s;tance, be|tween the mother and the daughter church, could not be too wide.</P>
<P>By degrees, as old conceits gave place to new, nature &s;o far prevailed, that the objections to getting money in general, were pretty well over|ruled: but &s;till this Jewi&s;h way of getting it, was too odious to be endured. Chri&s;tians were too intent upon plaguing Jews, to li&s;ten to the &s;ugge&s;tion of doing as Jews did, even though money were to be got by it. Indeed the ea&s;ier method, and a method pretty much in vogue, was, to let the Jews get the money any how they could, and then &s;queeze it out of them as it was wanted.</P>
<P>In proce&s;s of time, as que&s;tions of all &s;orts came under di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and this, not the lea&s;t intere&s;ting, among the re&s;t, the anti-Jewi&s;h &s;ide of it found no unopportune &s;upport in a pa&s;&s;age
<PB N="87" REF="030057_0082_0FE41B832CBA16A8">of Ari&s;totle: that celebrated heathen, who, in all matters wherein heatheni&s;m did not de&s;troy his competence, had e&s;tabli&s;hed a de&s;potic em|pire over the Chri&s;tian world. As fate would have it, that great philo&s;opher, with all his in|du&s;try, and all his penetration, notwith&s;tanding the great number of pieces of money that had pa&s;&s;ed through his hands (more perhaps than ever pa&s;&s;ed through the hands of a philo&s;opher before or &s;ince), and notwith&s;tanding the uncom|mon pains he had be&s;towed on the &s;ubject of generation, had never been able to di&s;cover, in any one piece of money, any organs for gene|rating any other &s;uch piece. Emboldened by &s;o &s;trong a body of negative proof, he ventured at la&s;t to u&s;her into the world the re&s;ult of his ob|&s;ervations, in the form of an univer&s;al propo&s;ition, that <HI>all money is in its nature barren.</HI> You, my friend, to who&s;e ca&s;t of mind &s;ound rea&s;on is much more congenial than ancient philo&s;ophy, you have, I dare to &s;ay, gone before me in re|marking, that the practical inference from this &s;hrewd ob&s;ervation, if it afforded any, &s;hould have been, that it would be to no purpo&s;e for
<PB N="88" REF="030057_0083_0FE41B87306AAF10">man to try to get five per cent, out of money&mdash; not, that if he could contrive to get &s;o much, there would be any harm in it. But the &s;ages of tho&s;e days did not view the matter in that light.</P>
<P>A con&s;ideration that did not happen to pre&s;ent it&s;elf to that great philo&s;opher, but which, had it happened to pre&s;ent it&s;elf, might not have been altogether unworthy of his notice, is, that though a <HI>daric</HI> would not beget another daric, any more than it would a ram, or an ewe, yet for a daric which a man borrowed, he might get a ram and a couple of ewes, and that the ewes, were the ram left with them a certain time, would probably not be barren. That then, at the end of the end of the year, he would find him&s;elf ma&s;ter of his three &s;heep, together with two, if not three, lambs; and that, if he &s;old his &s;heep again to pay back his daric, and gave one of his lambs for the u&s;e of it in the mean time, he would be two lambs, or at lea&s;t one lamb, richer, than if he had made no &s;uch bargain.</P>

The&s;e theological and philo&s;ophical conceits, the offspring of the day, were not ill &s;econded by principles of a more permanent complexion.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s of a money-lender, though only among Chri&s;tians, and in Chri&s;tian times, a pro|&s;cribed profe&s;&s;ion, has no where, nor at any time, been a popular one. Tho&s;e who have the re&s;olution to &s;acrifice the pre&s;ent to the future, are natural objects of envy to tho&s;e who have &s;acri|ficed the future to the pre&s;ent. The children who have eat their cake, are the natural enemies of the children who have theirs. While the money is hoped for, and for a &s;hort time after it has been received, he who lends it is a friend and benefactor: by the time the mo|ney is &s;pent, and the evil hour of reckoning is come, the benefactor is found to have changed his nature, and to have put on the tyrant and the oppre&s;&s;or. It is an oppre&s;&s;ion for a man to re|claim his own money: it is none to keep it from him. Among the incon&s;iderate, that is, among the great ma&s;s of mankind, &s;elfi&s;h affections con&s;pire with the &s;ocial in trea&s;uring up all fa|vour
<PB N="90" REF="030057_0085_0FE41B9338771018">for the man of di&s;&s;ipation, and in refu&s;ing ju&s;tice to the man of thrift who has &s;upplied him. In &s;ome &s;hape or other, that favour attends the cho&s;en object of it, through every &s;tage of his career. But, in no &s;tage of <HI>his</HI> career, can the man of thrift come in for any &s;hare of it. It is the general intere&s;t of tho&s;e with whom a man lives, that his expence &s;hould be at lea&s;t as great as his circum&s;tances will bear: becau&s;e there are few expences which a man can launch into, but what the benefit of them is &s;hared, in &s;ome pro|portion or other, by tho&s;e with whom he lives. In that circle originates a &s;tanding law, forbid|ding every man, on pain of infamy, to confine his expences within what is adjudged to be the mea&s;ure of his means, &s;aving always the power of exceeding that limit, as much as he thinks proper: and the means a&s;&s;igned him by that law may be ever &s;o much beyond his real means, but are &s;ure never to fall &s;hort of them. So clo&s;e is the combination thus formed be|tween the idea of merit and the idea of expen|diture, that a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;pend finds favour in the eyes even of tho&s;e who know that a man's
<PB N="91" REF="030057_0086_0FE41B9535848BD8">circum&s;tances do not entitle him to the means: and an up&s;tart, who&s;e chief recommendation is this di&s;po&s;ition, &s;hall find him&s;elf to have pur|cha&s;ed a permanent fund of re&s;pect, to the pre|judice of the very per&s;ons at who&s;e expence he has been gratifying his appetites and his pride. The lu&s;tre, which the di&s;play of borrowed wealth has diffu&s;ed over his character, awes men, during the &s;ea&s;on of his pro&s;perity, into a &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to his in&s;olence: and when the hand of adver&s;ity has overtaken him at la&s;t, the recollec|tion of the height, from which he is fallen, throws the veil of compa&s;&s;ion over his inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The condition of the man of thrift, is the re|ver&s;e. His la&s;ting opulence procures him a &s;hare, at lea&s;t, of the &s;ame envy, that attends the prodigal's tran&s;ient di&s;play: but the u&s;e he makes of it, procures him no part of the favour which attends the prodigal. In the &s;atisfactions he derives from that u&s;e, the plea&s;ure of po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, and the idea of enjoying, at &s;ome di&s;|tant period, which may never arrive, nobody comes in for any &s;hare. In the mid&s;t of his opu|lence,
<PB N="92" REF="030057_0087_0FE41B9904122128">he is regarded as a kind of in&s;olvent, who refu&s;es to honour the bills, which their rapacity would draw upon him, and who is by &s;o much the more criminal than other in&s;olvents, as not having the plea of inability for an excu&s;e.</P>
<P>Could there be any doubt of the disfavour, which attends the cau&s;e of the money-lender, in his competition with the borrower, and of the di&s;po&s;ition of the public judgment to &s;acrifice the intere&s;t of the former to that of the latter, the &s;tage would afford a compendious, but a pretty conclu&s;ive proof of it. It is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the dramati&s;t to &s;tudy, and to conform to, the hu|mours and pa&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e, on the plea&s;ing of whom he depends for his &s;ucce&s;s: it is the cour&s;e which reflection mu&s;t &s;ugge&s;t to every man, and which a man would naturally fall into, though he were not to think about it. He may, and very frequently does, make magnificent preten|ces, of giving the law to them: but woe be to him that attempts to give them any other law than what they are di&s;po&s;ed already to receive. If he would attempt to lead them one inch, it
<PB N="93" REF="030057_0088_0FE41B9B061995A0">mu&s;t be with great caution, and not without &s;uffering him&s;elf to be led by them at lea&s;t a do|zen. Now, I que&s;tion, whether, among all the in&s;tances in which a borrower and a lender of money have been brought together upon the &s;tage, from the days of The&s;pis to the pre&s;ent, there ever was one, in which the former was not recommended to favour, in &s;ome &s;hape or other, either to admiration, or to love, or to pity, or to all three; and the other, the man of thrift, con&s;igned to infamy.</P>
<P>Hence it is, that, in reviewing and adju&s;ting the intere&s;ts of the&s;e apparently rival parties, the advantage made by the borrower is &s;o apt to &s;lip out of &s;ight, and that made by the lender to ap|pear in &s;o exaggerated a point of view. Hence it is, that though prejudice is &s;o far &s;oftened, as to acquie&s;ce in the lender's making &s;ome advan|tage, le&s;t the borrower &s;hould lo&s;e altogether the bene&s;it of his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, yet &s;till the borrower is to have all the favour, and the lender's advan|tage is forever to be clipped, and pared down, as low as it will bear. Fir&s;t it was to be confined to
<PB N="94" REF="030057_0089_0FE41B9CAE291BB0">ten percent. then to eight, then to &s;ix, then to five, and now lately there was a report of its being to be brought down to four; with con&s;tant liberty to &s;ink as much lower as it would. The burden of the&s;e re&s;traints, of cour&s;e, has been intended exclu&s;ively for the lender: in reality, as I think you have &s;een, it pre&s;&s;es much more heavily upon the borrower: I mean him who either becomes, or in vain wi&s;hes to become &s;o. But the pre|&s;ents directed by prejudice, Dr. Smith will tell us, are not always delivered according to their addre&s;s. It was thus that the mill-&s;tone de&s;igned for the necks of tho&s;e vermin, as they have been called, the dealers in corn, was found to fall upon the heads of the con&s;umers. It is thus&mdash;but further examples would lead me further from the purpo&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XI. <HI>Compound Intere&s;t.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A WORD or two I mu&s;t trouble you with, concerning <HI>compound intere&s;t;</HI> for compound intere&s;t is di&s;countenanced by the law; I &s;up|po&s;e, as a &s;ort of u&s;ury. That, without an ex|pre&s;s &s;tipulation, the law never gives it, I well remember: whether, in ca&s;e of an expre&s;s &s;tipu|lation, the law allows it to be taken, I am not ab&s;olutely certain. I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e it might: remembering covenants in mortgages that inter|e&s;t &s;hould become principal. At any rate, I think the law cannot well puni&s;h it under the name of u&s;ury.</P>
<P>If the di&s;countenance &s;hewn to this arrange|ment be grounded on the horror of the &s;in of u&s;ury, the impropriety of &s;uch di&s;countenance
<PB N="96" REF="030057_0091_0FE41BA1C16D6EC8">follows of cour&s;e, from the arguments which &s;hew the un&s;infulne&s;s of that &s;in.</P>
<P>Other argument again&s;t it, I believe, was never attempted, unle&s;s it were the giving to &s;uch an arrangement the epithet of a <HI>hard</HI> one: in doing which, &s;omething more like a rea&s;on is given, than one gets in ordinary from the com|mon law.</P>
<P>If that con&s;i&s;tency were to be found in the common law, which has never yet been found in man's conduct, and which perhaps is hardly in man's nature, compound intere&s;t never could have been denied.</P>
<P>The views which &s;ugge&s;ted this denial, were, I dare to &s;ay, very good: the effects of it are, I am certain, very pernicious.</P>
<P>If the borrower pays the intere&s;t at the day, if he performs his engagement, that very engage|ment to which the law pretends to oblige him to conform, the lender, who receives that intere&s;t,
<PB N="97" REF="030057_0092_0FE41BA3CC3C0CB0">makes compound intere&s;t of cour&s;e, by lending it out again, unle&s;s he choo&s;es rather to expend it: he expects to receive it at the day, or what meant the engagement? if he fails of receiving it, he is by &s;o much a lo&s;er: the borrower by pay|ing it at the day is no lo&s;er: if he does not pay it at the day, he is by &s;o much a gainer: a pain of di&s;appointment takes place in the ca&s;e of the one, while no &s;uch pain takes place in the ca&s;e of the other. The cau&s;e of him who&s;e con|tention is to <HI>catch a gain,</HI> is thus preferred to that of him who&s;e contention is to avoid a lo&s;s: con|trary to the rea&s;onable and u&s;eful maxim of that branch of the common law which has acquired the name of equity. The gain, which the law in its tenderne&s;s thus be&s;tows on the defaulter, is an encouragement, a reward, which it holds out for breach of faith, for iniquity, for indolence, for negligence.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s, which it thus throws upon the forbearing lender, is a puni&s;hment which it in|flicts on him for his forbearance: the power which it gives him of avoiding that lo&s;s, by pro|&s;ecuting
<PB N="98" REF="030057_0093_0FE41BA57327D728">the borrower upon the in&s;tant of failure, is thus converted into a reward which it holds out to him for his hard-heartedne&s;s and rigour. Man is not quite &s;o good as it were to be wi&s;h|ed he were; but he would be bad indeed, were he bad on all the occa&s;ions where the law, as far as depends on her, has made it his intere&s;t &s;o to be.</P>
<P>It may be impo&s;&s;ible, &s;ay you, it often is im|po&s;&s;ible, for the borrower to pay the intere&s;t at the day: and you &s;ay truly. What is the in|ference? That the creditor &s;hould <HI>not</HI> have it in his power to ruin the debtor for not paying at the day, and that he <HI>&s;hould</HI> receive a compen|&s;ation for the lo&s;s occa&s;ioned by &s;uch failure.&mdash; He has it in his power to ruin him, and he has it not in his power to obtain &s;uch compen&s;ation. The judge, were it po&s;&s;ible for an arre&s;ted debtor to find his way into a judge's chamber in&s;tead of a &s;punging-hou&s;e, might award a proper re&s;|pite, &s;uited to the circum&s;tances of the parties. It is not po&s;&s;ible: but a re&s;pite is purcha&s;ed, proper or not proper, perhaps at ten times, per|haps
<PB N="99" REF="030057_0094_0FE41BA7849AE8C8">at a hundred times the expence of com|pound intere&s;t, by putting in bail, and fighting the creditor through all the windings of mi&s;|chievous and unnece&s;&s;ary delay. Of the &s;atis|faction due either for the original failure, or for the &s;ub&s;equent vexation by which it has been aggravated, no part is ever received by the in|jured creditor: but the in&s;truments of the law receive, perhaps at his expence, perhaps at the debtor's, perhaps ten times, perhaps a hundred times the amount of that &s;atisfaction. Such is the re&s;ult of this tenderne&s;s of the law.</P>
<P>It is in con&s;equence of &s;uch tenderne&s;s, that on &s;o many occa&s;ions, a man, though ever &s;o able, would find him&s;elf a lo&s;er by paying his ju&s;t debts: tho&s;e very debts of which the law has recognized the ju&s;tice. The man who obeys the dictates of common hone&s;ty, the man who does what the law pretends to bid him, is want|ing to him&s;elf. Hence your regular and &s;ecurely profitable writs of error in the hou&s;e of lords: hence your random and vindictive co&s;ts of one hundred pounds, and two hundred pounds, now
<PB N="100" REF="030057_0095_0FE41BACD03742A8">and then given in that hou&s;e. It is natural, and it is &s;omething, to find, in a company of lords, a zeal for ju&s;tice: it is not natural, to find, in &s;uch a company, a di&s;po&s;ition to bend down to the toil of calculation.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XII. <HI>Maintenance and Champerty.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HAVING, in the preceding letters, had occa&s;ion to lay down, and, as I flatter my&s;elf, to make good, the general principle, that <HI>no man of ripe years, and of &s;ound mind, ought, out of loving-kinde&s;s to him, to be hindered from mak|ing &s;uch a bargain, in the way of obtaining mo|ney, as, acting with his eyes open, he deems condu|cive to his intere&s;t;</HI> I will take your leave for pu&s;hing it a little farther, and extending the application of it to another cla&s;s of regulations &s;till le&s;s defen&s;ible. I mean the antique laws again&s;t what are called Maintenance and Cham|perty.</P>
<P>To the head of <HI>Maintenance,</HI> I think you refer, be&s;ides other offences which are not to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, that of purcha&s;ing, upon any
<PB N="102" REF="030057_0097_0FE41BB0B12F7DE0">terms, any claim, which it requires a &s;uit at law, or in equity, to enforce.</P>
<P>Champerty, which is but a particular modifi|cation of this &s;in of Maintenance, is, I think, the furni&s;hing a man who has &s;uch a claim, with regard to a real e&s;tate, &s;uch money as he may have occa&s;ion for, to carry on &s;uch claim, upon the terms of receiving a part of the e&s;tate in ca&s;e of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>What the penalties are for the&s;e offences, I do not recollect; nor do I think it worth while hunting for them, though I have Black&s;tone at my elbow. They are, at any rate, &s;ufficiently &s;evere to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e, the rather as the bargain is made void.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate the mi&s;chievou&s;ne&s;s of the laws by which they have been created, give me leave to tell you a &s;tory, which is but too true a one, which happened to fall within my own ob&s;erva|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="030057_0098_0FE41BB25CB24870">
A gentleman of my acquaintance had &s;uc|ceeded, during his minority, to an e&s;tate of about 3000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year; I will not &s;ay where.&mdash; His guardian, concealing from him the value of the e&s;tate, which circum&s;tances rendered it ea&s;y for him to do, got a conveyance of it from him, during his non-age, for a trifle. Immedi|ately upon the ward's coming of age, the guar|dian, keeping him &s;till in darkne&s;s, found means to get the conveyance confirmed. Some years afterwards, the ward di&s;covered the value of the inheritance he had been throwing away. Pri|vate repre&s;entations proving, as it may be ima|gined, ineffectual, he applied to a court of equity. The &s;uit was in &s;ome forwardne&s;s: the opinion of the able&s;t coun&s;el highly encouraging: but money there remained none. We all know but too well, that, in &s;pite of the unimpeachable integrity of the bench, that branch of ju&s;tice, which is particularly dignified with the name of equity, is only for tho&s;e who can afford to throw away one fortune for the chance of re|covering another. Two per&s;ons, however, were found, who, between them, were content to
<PB N="104" REF="030057_0099_0FE41BB6C7BD3F38">defray the expence of the ticket for this lottery, on condition of receiving half the prize. The pro&s;pect now became encouraging: when un|fortunately one of the adventurers, in exploring the rece&s;&s;es of the bottomle&s;s pit, happened to dig up one of the old &s;tatutes again&s;t Champerty. This blew up the whole project: however, the defendant, under&s;tanding that, &s;ome how or other, his antagoni&s;t had found &s;upport, had thought fit in the mean time to propo&s;e terms, which the plaintiff, after his &s;upport had thus dropped from under him, was very glad to clo&s;e with. He received, I think it was, 3000<ABBR>l.</ABBR>; and for that he gave up the e&s;tate, which was worth about as much yearly, together with the arrears, which were worth about as much as the e&s;tate.</P>
<P>Whether, in the barbarous age which gave birth to the&s;e barbarous precautions, whether, even under the zenith of feudal anarchy, &s;uch fettering regulations could have had rea&s;on on their &s;ide, is a que&s;tion of curio&s;ity rather than u&s;e. My notion is, that there never was a time,
<PB N="105" REF="030057_0100_0FE41BB86CEEE630">that there never could have been, or can be a time, when the pu&s;hing of &s;uitors away from court with one hand, while they are beckoned into it with another, would not be a policy equally faith|le&s;s, incon&s;i&s;tent, and ab&s;urd. But, what every body mu&s;t acknowledge, is, that, to the times which called forth the&s;e laws, and in which alone they could have &s;tarted up, the pre&s;ent are as op|po&s;ite as light to darkne&s;s. A mi&s;chief, in tho&s;e times, it &s;eems, but too common, though a mi&s;chief not to be cured by &s;uch laws, was, that a man would buy a weak claim, in hopes that power might convert it into a &s;trong one, and that the &s;word of a baron, &s;talking into court with a rab|ble of retainers at his heels, might &s;trike terror into the eyes of a judge upon the bench. At pre&s;ent, what cares an Engli&s;h judge for the &s;words of an hundred barons? Neither fearing nor hoping, hating nor loving, the judge of our days is ready with equal phlegm to admini&s;ter, upon all occa&s;ions, that &s;y&s;tem, whatever it be, of ju&s;tice, or inju&s;tice, which the law has put in his hands. A di&s;po&s;ition &s;o con&s;onant to duty, could not have then been hoped for: one
<PB N="106" REF="030057_0101_0FE41B8FDEAEDBC0">more con&s;onant is hardly to be wi&s;hed. Wealth has, indeed, the monopoly of ju&s;tice again&s;t po|verty: and &s;uch monopoly it is the direct ten|dency and nece&s;&s;ary effect of regulations like the&s;e to &s;trengthen and confirm. But with this monopoly no judge that lives now, is at all chargeable. The law created this monopoly: the law, whenever it plea&s;es, may di&s;&s;olve it.</P>
<P>I will not, however, &s;o far wander from my &s;ubject as to enquire what mea&s;ure might have been nece&s;&s;ary to afford a full relief to the ca&s;e of that unfortunate gentleman, any more than to the ca&s;es of &s;o many other gentlemen who might be found, as unfortunate as he. I will not in&s;i&s;t upon &s;o &s;trange and &s;o inconceivable an arrangement, as that of the judge's &s;eeing both parties face to face in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, ob|&s;erving what the facts are in di&s;pute, and de|claring, that as the facts &s;hould turn out this way or that way, &s;uch or &s;uch would be his de|cree. At pre&s;ent, I confine my&s;elf to the re|moval of &s;uch part of the mi&s;chief, as may ari&s;e from the general conce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">, of keeping men out of
<PB N="107" REF="030057_0102_0FE41B918FE2B238">difficulties, by cutting them off from &s;uch means of relief as each man's &s;ituation may afford. A &s;punge in this, as in &s;o many other ca&s;es, is the only needful, and only availing remedy: one &s;troke of it for the mu&s;ty laws again&s;t mainte|nance and champerty: another for the more recent ones again&s;t u&s;ury. Con&s;ider, for exam|ple, what would have re&s;pectively been the effect of two &s;uch &s;trokes, in the ca&s;e of the unfortu|nate gentleman I have been &s;peaking of. By the fir&s;t, if what is called equity has any claim to confidence, he would have got, even after pay|ing off his champerty-u&s;urers, 1500<ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year in land, and about as much in money: in&s;tead of getting, and that only by an accident, 3000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> once told. By the other, there is no &s;aying to what a degree he might have been benefited.&mdash; May I be allowed to &s;tretch &s;o far in favour of the law as to &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;o &s;mall a &s;um as 500<ABBR>l.</ABBR> would have carried him through his &s;uit, in the cour&s;e of about three years? I am &s;en&s;ible, that may be thought but a &s;hort &s;um, and this but a &s;hort term, for a &s;uit in equity: but, for the purpo&s;e of illu&s;tration, it may &s;erve as well
<PB N="108" REF="030057_0103_0FE41BBA17742298">as a longer. Suppo&s;e he had &s;ought this nece&s;|&s;ary &s;um in the way of borrowing; and had been &s;o fortunate, or, as the laws again&s;t the &s;in of u&s;ury would &s;tile it, &s;o unfortunate, as to get it at 200 per cent. He would then have pur|cha&s;ed his 6000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year at the price of half as much once paid, viz. 3000<ABBR>l.</ABBR>; in&s;tead of &s;elling it at that price. Whether, if no &s;uch laws again&s;t u&s;ury had been in being, he could have got the money, even at that rate, I will not pretend to &s;ay: perhaps he might not have got it under ten times that rate, perhaps he might have got it at the tenth part of that rate. Thus far, I think, we may &s;ay, that he might, and probably would, have been the better for the repeal of tho&s;e laws: but thus far we mu&s;t &s;ay, that it is impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould have been the wor&s;e. The terms, upon which he met with adventurers willing to relieve him, though they come not within that &s;canty field, which the law, in the narrowne&s;s of its views, calls u&s;ury, do, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, at twenty years' purcha&s;e of the 3000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> a year he was content to have &s;acrificed for &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance, amount, in effect, to 4000
<PB N="109" REF="030057_0104_0FE41BBC17D3EA20">per cent. Whether it was likely that any man, who was di&s;po&s;ed to venture his money at all, upon &s;uch a chance, would have thought of in&s;i&s;ting upon &s;uch a rate of intere&s;t, I will leave you to imagine: but thus much may be &s;aid with confidence, becau&s;e the fact demon&s;trates it, that at a rate not exceeding this, the &s;um actually would have been &s;upplied. Whatever becomes, then, of the laws again&s;t maintenance and champerty, the example in que&s;tion, when applied to the laws again&s;t u&s;ury, ought, I think, to be &s;ufficient to convince us, that &s;o long as the expence of &s;eeking relief at law &s;tands on its pre&s;ent footing, the purpo&s;e of &s;eeking that relief will, of it&s;elf, independently of every other, afford a &s;ufficient ground for allowing any man, or every man, to borrow money on any terms he can obtain it.</P>

<P>I FORGET what &s;on of controver&s;y it was, among the Greeks, who, having put him|&s;elf to &s;chool, to a profe&s;&s;or of eminence, to learn what, in tho&s;e days, went by the name of wi&s;dom, cho&s;e an attack upon his ma&s;ter for the fir&s;t public &s;pecimen of his proficiency.

It was a reflection mentioned by Cicero as affording him &s;ome comfort, that the employ|ment his talents, till that time, had met with, had been chiefly on the defending &s;ide. How little &s;oever ble&s;t, on any occa&s;ion, with any portion of his eloquence, I may, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, however, indulge my&s;elf with a portion of what con&s;tituted his comfort: for, if I pre|&s;ume to contend with you, it is only in de&s;ence of what I look upon as, not only an innocent, but a mo&s;t meritorious race of men, who are &s;o unfortunate as to have fallen under the rod of your di&s;plea&s;ure.

<P>The pa&s;&s;age, I am &s;peaking of, is in the fourth chapter of your &s;econd book, volume the &s;econd of the 8vo. edition of 1784. "The legal rate" (you &s;ay) "it is to be ob&s;erved, though it ought to be &s;omewhat above, ought not to be much above, the lowe&s;t market rate. If the legal rate of intere&s;t in Great Britain, for example, was fixed &s;o high as eight or ten per cent. the greater part of the money which was to be lent, would be lent to prodigals and projectors, who alone would be willing to give this high intere&s;t. Sober people, who will give for the u&s;e of mo|ney no more than a part of what they are likely to make by the u&s;e of it, would not venture into the competition. A great part of the capital of the country would thus be kept out of the hands which were mo&s;t likely to make a profitable and advantageous u&s;e of it, and thrown into tho&s;e which were mo&s;t likely to wa&s;te and de&s;troy it. Where the legal intere&s;t, on the contrary, is fixed but a very little above the lowe&s;t market
<PB N="115" REF="030057_0109_0FE41BC945D93CF8">rate, &s;ober people are univer&s;ally preferred as borrowers, to prodigals and projectors.

A great part of the capital of the country is thus thrown into the hands in which it is mo&s;t likely to be employed with advantage."</P>
<P>It happens fortunately for the &s;ide you appear to have taken, and as unfortunately for mine, that the appellative, which the cu&s;tom of the language has authorized you, and which the po|verty and perver&s;ity of the language has, in a manner, forced you to make u&s;e of, is one, which, along with the idea of the &s;ort of per|&s;ons in que&s;tion, conveys the idea of reproba|tion, as indi&s;criminately and de&s;ervedly applied to them. With what ju&s;tice or con&s;i&s;tency, or by the influence of what cau&s;es, this &s;tamp of indi&s;criminate reprobation has been thus affixed, it is not immediately nece&s;&s;ary to enquire. But,
<PB N="116" REF="030057_0110_0FE41BCB1765DE40">that it does &s;tand thus affixed, you and every body el&s;e, I imagine, will be ready enough to allow.

In the conceptions of all &s;uch per&s;ons, to a&s;k whether it be &s;it to re&s;train projects, and projectors, will be as much as to a&s;k, whether it be fit to re&s;train ra&s;hne&s;s, and folly, and ab&s;urdity, and knavery, and wa&s;te.</P>
<P>Of prodigals I &s;hall &s;ay no more at pre&s;ent. I have already &s;tated my rea&s;ons for thinking, that it is not among them that we are to look for the natural cu&s;tomers for money at high rates of intere&s;t. As far as tho&s;e rea&s;ons are conclu|&s;ive, it will follow, that, of the two &s;orts of men you mention as proper objects of the burden of the&s;e re&s;traints, prodigals and projectors, that
<PB N="117" REF="030057_0111_0FE41BCD145C6700">burden falls exclu&s;ively on the latter. As to the&s;e, what your definition is of projectors, and what de&s;criptions of per&s;ons you meant to in|clude under the cen&s;ure conveyed by that name, might be material for the purpo&s;e of judging of the propriety of that cen&s;ure, but makes no dif|ference in judging of the propriety of the law, which that cen&s;ure is employed to ju&s;tify. Whe|ther you your&s;elf, were the &s;everal cla&s;&s;es of per&s;ons made to pa&s;s before you in review, would be di&s;po&s;ed to pick out this or that cla&s;s, or this and that individual, in order to exempt them from &s;uch cen&s;ure, is what, for that pur|po&s;e, we have no need to enquire. The law, it is certain, makes no &s;uch di&s;tinctions; it falls with equal weight, and with all its weight, upon all tho&s;e per&s;ons, without di&s;tinction, to whom the term <HI>projectors,</HI> in the mo&s;t impartial and exten&s;ive &s;ignification of which it is capable, can be applied. It falls, at any rate, (to repeat &s;ome of the words of my former definition) upon all &s;uch per&s;ons, as, in the pur&s;uit of wealth, or even of any other object, endeavour, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of wealth, to &s;trike into any channel
<PB N="118" REF="030057_0112_0FE41BCEBB924E20">of invention.

<P>High and extraordinary rates of intere&s;t, how little &s;oever adapted to the &s;ituation of the prodi|gal, are certainly, as you very ju&s;tly ob&s;erve, particularly adapted to the &s;ituation of the pro|jector: not however to that of the imprudent projector only, nor even to his ca&s;e more than another's, but to that of the prudent and well|grounded projector, if the exi&s;tence of &s;uch a

Whatever be the prudence or other qualities of the project, in whatever circum&s;tance the novelty of it may lie, it has this circum&s;tance again&s;t it, viz. that it is new. But the rates of intere&s;t, the highe&s;t rates allowed, are, as you expre&s;sly &s;ay they are, and as you would have them to be, adju&s;ted to the &s;ituation which the &s;ort of trader is in, who&s;e trade runs in the old channels, and to the be&s;t &s;ecurity which &s;uch channels can afford. But, in the nature of things, no new trade, no trade carried on in any new channel, can afford a &s;ecurity equal to that which may be afforded by a trade carried on in any of the old ones: in whatever light the matter might appear to perfect intelli|gence, in the eye of every prudent per&s;on, ex|erting the be&s;t powers of judging which the fal|lible condition of the human faculties affords, the novelty of any commercial adventure will oppo&s;e a chance of ill &s;ucce&s;s, &s;uperadded to every one which could attend the &s;ame, or any other adventure, already tried, and proved to be profitable by experience.</P>

The limitation of the profit that is to be made, by lending money to per&s;ons embarked in trade, will render the monied man more anxious, you may &s;ay, about the goodne&s;s of his &s;ecurity, and accordingly more anxious to &s;atisfy him&s;elf re|&s;pecting the prudence of a project, in the carry|ing on of which the money is to be employed, than he would be otherwi&s;e: and in this way it may be thought that the&s;e laws <HI>have</HI> a tendency to pick out the good projects from the bad, and favour the former at the expence of the latter. The fir&s;t of the&s;e po&s;itions I admit: but I can never admit the con&s;equence to follow. A prudent man, (I mean nothing more than a man of ordinary prudence) a prudent man acting un|der the &s;ole governance of prudential motives, I &s;till &s;ay will not, in the&s;e circum&s;tances, pick out the good projects from the bad, for he will not meddle with projects at all. He will pick out old-e&s;tabli&s;hed trades from all &s;orts of projects, good and bad; for with a new project, be it ever &s;o promi&s;ing, he never will have any thing to do. By every man that has money, five per cent. or whatever be the highe&s;t legal rate, is at all
<PB N="121" REF="030057_0115_0FE41BD66BB2C868">times, and always will be, to be had upon the very be&s;t &s;ecurity, that the be&s;t and mo&s;t pro&s;|perous old-e&s;tabli&s;hed trade can afford. Traders in general, I believe, it is commonly under&s;tood, are well enough inclined to enlarge their capital, as far as all the money they can borrow at the highe&s;t legal rate, while that rate is &s;o low as five per cent. will enlarge it. How it is po&s;&s;ible, therefore, for a project, be it ever &s;o promi&s;ing, to afford, to a lender at any &s;uch rate of intere&s;t, terms equally advantageous, upon the whole, with tho&s;e he might be &s;ure of obtaining from an old-e&s;tabli&s;hed bu&s;ine&s;s, is more than I can conceive. Loans of money may certainly chance, now and then, to find their way into the pockets of projectors as well as of other men: but when this happens it mu&s;t be through incautiou&s;ne&s;s, or friend&s;hip, or the expectation of &s;ome collateral benefit, and not through any idea of the advantageou&s;ne&s;s of the tran&s;action, in the light of a pecuniary bargain.</P>

But, unle&s;s the &s;tock of well-grounded projects is already &s;pent, and the whole &s;tock of ill-grounded projects that ever were po&s;&s;ible, are to be looked for exclu&s;ively in the time to come, the cen&s;ure you have pa&s;&s;ed on projectors, mea&s;uring &s;till the extent of it by that of the operation of the laws in the defence of which it is employed, looks as far backward as forward: it condemns as ra&s;h and ill-ground|ed, all tho&s;e projects, by which our &s;pecies have been &s;ucce&s;&s;ively advanced from that &s;tate in which acorns were their food, and raw hides their cloathing, to the &s;tate in which it &s;tands at pre&s;ent: for think, Sir, let me beg of you, whe|ther whatever is now the <HI>routine</HI> of trade was not, at its commencement, <HI>project?</HI> whether
<PB N="123" REF="030057_0117_0FE41BDC161AB100">whatever is now <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hment,</HI> was not, at one time, innovation?</P>
<P>How it is that the tribe of well-grounded projects, and of prudent projectors (if by this time I may have your leave for applying this epithet to &s;ome, at lea&s;t, among the projectors of time pa&s;t), have managed to &s;truggle through the ob&s;tacles which the laws in que&s;tion have been holding in their way, it is neither ea&s;y to know, nor nece&s;&s;ary to enquire. Manife&s;t enough, I think, it mu&s;t be by this time, that difficulties, and tho&s;e not incon&s;iderable ones, tho&s;e laws mu&s;t have been holding in the way of projects of all &s;orts of improvement (if I may &s;ay &s;o) in every line, &s;o long as they have had exi&s;tence: rea&s;onable, therefore, it mu&s;t be to conclude, that, had it not been for the&s;e di&s;|couragements, projects of all &s;orts, well-ground|ed and &s;ucce&s;sful ones, as well as others, would have been more numerous than they have been: and that accordingly, on the other hand, as &s;oon, if ever, as the&s;e di&s;couragements &s;hall be removed, projects of all &s;orts, and among the
<PB N="124" REF="030057_0118_0FE41BDDF9160B50">re&s;t, well-grounded and &s;ucce&s;sful ones, will be more numerous than they would otherwi&s;e have been: in &s;hort, that, as, without the&s;e di&s;cou|ragements, the progre&s;s of mankind, in the career of pro&s;perity, would have been greater than it has been under them in time pa&s;t, &s;o, were they to be removed, it would be at lea&s;t proportionably greater in time future.</P>
<P>That I have done you no inju&s;tice, in a&s;&s;ign|ing to your idea of projectors &s;o great a latitude, and that the unfavourable opinion you have pro|fe&s;&s;ed to entertain of them is not confined to the above pa&s;&s;age, might be made, I think, pretty apparent, if it be material, by another pa&s;&s;age in the tenth chapter of your fir&s;t book, (edit. 1784, 8vo. p. 177.) "The e&s;tabli&s;hment of any new manufacture, of any new branch of commerce, or of any new practice in agriculture," all the&s;e you comprehend by name under the li&s;t of <HI>"projects:"</HI> of every one of them you ob&s;erve, that "it is a &s;peculation from which the <HI>projector</HI> promi&s;es him&s;elf extraordinary pro|fits.

If the project &s;ucceeds, they are commonly at fir&s;t very high.

But on this head I forbear to in&s;i&s;t: nor &s;hould I have taken this liberty of giving you back your own words, but in the hope of &s;eeing &s;ome alter|ation made in them in your next edition, &s;hould I be fortunate enough to find my &s;entiments confirmed by your's.

No very ea&s;y ta&s;k, I believe: the fact is too manife&s;t for the mo&s;t jaundiced eye to e&s;cape &s;eeing it: but
<PB N="128" REF="030057_0122_0FE41BE6E3946DD0">what and whom are we to thank for it, but pro|jects, and projectors?</P>
<P>"No," I think I hear you &s;aying, "I will not thank projectors for it; I will rather thank the laws, which, by fixing the rates of intere&s;t, have been exerci&s;ing their vigilance in repre&s;&s;ing the temerity of projectors, and preventing their imprudence from making tho&s;e defalcations from the &s;um of national pro&s;perity which it would not have failed to make, had it been left free. If, during all the&s;e periods, that adventurous race of men had been left at liberty by the laws to give full &s;cope to their ra&s;h enterprizes, the increa&s;e of national pro&s;perity during the&s;e pe|xiods might have afforded &s;ome ground for re|garding them in a more favourable point of view. But the fact is, that their activity has had the&s;e laws to check it: without which checks you mu&s;t give me leave to &s;uppo&s;e, that the current of pro&s;perity, if not totally &s;topt, or turned the other way, would, at any rate, have been more or le&s;s retarded. Here then," (you conclude) "lies the difference between us: what you look
<PB N="129" REF="030057_0123_0FE41BE8E466E4B8">upon as the cau&s;e of the increa&s;e about which we are both agreed, I look upon as an ob&s;tacle to it: and what you look upon as the ob&s;tacle, I look upon as the cau&s;e."</P>
<P>In&s;tead of &s;tating this as a &s;ort of plea that might be urged by you, I ought, perhaps, rather to have mentioned it as what might be urged by &s;ome people in your place: for, as I do not ima|gine your penetration would &s;uffer you to re&s;t &s;atis&s;ied with it, &s;till le&s;s can I &s;uppo&s;e that, if you were not, your candour would allow you to make u&s;e of it as if you were.</P>
<P>To prevent your re&s;ting &s;atisfied with it, the following con&s;iderations would, I think, be &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, of the &s;even periods which you have pitched upon, as &s;o many &s;tages for the eye to re&s;t at in viewing the progre&s;s of pro&s;pe|rity, it is only during the three la&s;t, that the country has had the benefit, if &s;uch we are to
<PB N="130" REF="030057_0124_0FE41BEA8F8D3380">call it, of the&s;e laws: for it is to the reign of Henry VIII. that we owe the fir&s;t of them.</P>
<P>Here a multitude of que&s;tions might be &s;tart|ed: Whether the curbing of projectors formed any part of the de&s;ign of that fir&s;t &s;tatute, or whether the views of it were not wholly confined to the reducing the gains of that obnoxi|ous and envied cla&s;s of men, the money|lenders? Whether projectors have been mo&s;t abundant before that &s;tatute, or &s;ince that &s;ta|tute? And whether the nation has &s;uffered, as you might &s;ay&mdash;benefited, as I &s;hould &s;ay, mo&s;t by them, upon the whole, during the former period or the latter? All the&s;e di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, and many more that might be &s;larted, I decline engaging in, as more likely to retard, than to forward, our coming to any agreement con|cerning the main que&s;tion.</P>
<P>In the next place, I mu&s;t here take the liberty of referring you to the proof, which I think I have already given, of the propo&s;ition, that the re&s;traints in que&s;tion could never have had the
<PB N="131" REF="030057_0125_0FE41BEF6D444990">effect, in any degree, of le&s;&s;ening the proportion of bad projects to good ones, but only of dimin|i&s;hing, as far as their influence may have extend|ed, the total number of projects, good and bad together. Whatever, therefore, was the general tendency of the projecting &s;pirit previou&s;ly to the fir&s;t of the&s;e laws, &s;uch it mu&s;t have remain|ed ever &s;ince, for any effect which they could have had in purifying and correcting it.</P>
<P>But what may appear more &s;atisfactory, per|haps, than both the above con&s;iderations, and may afford us the be&s;t help towards extricating our|&s;elves from the perplexity, which the plea I have been combating (and which I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to bring to view, as the be&s;t that could be urged) &s;eems much better calculated to plunge us into, than bring us out of, is, the con&s;idera|tion of the &s;mall effect which the greate&s;t wa&s;te that can be conceived to have been made within any compa&s;s of time, by injudicious projects, can have had on the &s;um of pro&s;perity, even in the e&s;tima|tion of tho&s;e who&s;e opinion is mo&s;t unfavourable to projectors, in compari&s;on of the effect which,

<P>Of the two cau&s;es, and only two cau&s;es, which you mention, as contributing to retard the accumulation of national wealth, as far as the conduct of individuals is concerned, projecting, as I ob&s;erved before, is the one, and prodigality is the other: but the detriment, which &s;ociety can receive even from the concurrent efficacy of both the&s;e cau&s;es, you repre&s;ent, on &s;everal oc|ca&s;ions, as incon&s;iderable; and if I do not mi&s;|apprehend you, too incon&s;iderable, either to need, or to warrant, the interpo&s;ition of govern|ment to oppo&s;e it. Be this as it may with regard to projecting and prodigality taken together, with regard to prodigality at lea&s;t, I am certain I do not mi&s;apprehend you. On this &s;ubject you ride triumphant, and cha&s;ti&s;e the "imper|tinence and pre&s;umption of kings and mini&s;ters," with a tone of authority, which it required a courage like yours to venture upon, and a genius like yours to warrant a man to a&s;&s;ume (b. II. ch. iii. vol. ii. p. 27. edit. 8vo. 1784.) After
<PB N="133" REF="030057_0127_0FE41BF31670A8D0">drawing the parallel between private thrift and public profu&s;ion, "It is" (you conclude) "the highe&s;t impertinence and pre&s;umption, there|fore, in kings and mini&s;ters <HI>to pretend to watch over the economy of private people,</HI> and to re&s;train their expence, either by &s;umptuary laws, or by prohibiting the importation of foreign luxuries. They are them&s;elves always, and without ex|ception, the greate&s;t &s;pendthrifts in the &s;ociety. Let them look well after their own expence, and they may &s;afely tru&s;t private people with theirs. If their own extravagance does not ruin the &s;tate, that of their &s;ubjects never will."</P>
<P>That the employing the expedients you mention for re&s;training prodigality, is indeed generally, perhaps even without exception, improper, and in many ca&s;es even ridiculous, I agree with you; nor will I here &s;tep a&s;ide from my &s;ubject to defend, from that imputation, another mode &s;ugge&s;ted in a former part of the&s;e papers. But however pre&s;umptuous and imperti|nent it may be for the &s;overeign to attempt in any way to check, by legal re&s;traints, the <HI>prodi|gality</HI>
<PB N="134" REF="030057_0128_0FE41BF4BB835230">of individuals; to attempt to check their <HI>bad management</HI> by &s;uch re&s;traints &s;eems abun|dantly more &s;o. To err in the way of prodi|gality is the lot, though, as you well ob&s;erve, not of <HI>many</HI> men, in compari&s;on of the whole ma&s;s of mankind, yet at lea&s;t of <HI>any</HI> man: the &s;tuff fit to make a prodigal of is to be found in every ale-hou&s;e, and under every hedge. But even to <HI>err</HI> in the way of projecting is the lot only of the privileged few. Prodigality, though not &s;o common as to make any very material drain from the general ma&s;s of wealth, is, how|ever, too common to be regarded as a mark of di&s;tinction, or as a &s;ingularity. But the &s;tepping a&s;ide from any of the beaten paths of traffic, <HI>is</HI> regarded as a &s;ingularity, as &s;erving to di&s;tingui&s;h a man from other men. Even where it requires no genius, no peculiarity of talent, as where it con&s;i&s;ts in nothing more than the finding out a new market to buy or &s;ell in, it requires, how|ever, at lea&s;t, a degree of courage, which is not to be found in the common herd of men. What &s;hall we &s;ay of it, where, in addition to the vul|gar quality of courage, it requires the rare en|dowment
<PB N="135" REF="030057_0129_0FE41BF891211220">of genius, as in the in&s;tance of all tho&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ive enterprizes by which arts and manu|factures have been brought from their original nothing to their pre&s;ent &s;plendor? Think how &s;mall a part of the community the&s;e mu&s;t make, in compari&s;on of the race of prodigals; of that very race, which, were it only on account of the &s;mallne&s;s of its number, would appear too incon&s;iderable to you to de&s;erve attention. Yet prodigality is e&s;&s;entially and nece&s;&s;arily hurtful, as far as it goes, to the opulence of the &s;tate: projecting, only by accident. Every prodigal without exception, impairs&mdash;by the very &s;uppo&s;i|tion impairs&mdash;if he does not annihilate, his for|tune. But it certainly is not every projector that impairs his: it is not every projector that would have done &s;o, had there been none of tho&s;e wi&s;e laws to hinder him: for the fabric of national opulence, that fabric of which you pro|claim, with &s;o generous an exultation, the con|tinual increa&s;e, that fabric, in every apartment of which, innumerable as they are, it required the reprobated hand of a projector to lay the fir&s;t &s;tone, has required &s;ome hands at lea&s;t to be em|ployed,

<P>"What is the &s;pecies of dome&s;tic indu&s;try which his capital can employ, and of which the produce is likely to be of the greate&s;t value, every individual, (you &s;ay) it is evident, can, in his local &s;ituation, judge much better than any &s;tate&s;man or lawgiver can do for him. The &s;tate&s;man, who &s;hould attempt to direct private people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals, would not only load him&s;elf with a mo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary attention, but a&s;&s;ume an authority which could &s;afely be tru&s;ted, not only to no &s;ingle per&s;on, but to no council or &s;enate what|&s;oever, and which would no where be &s;o dan|gerous as in the hands of a man who had folly and pre&s;umption enough to fancy him&s;elf &s;it to exerci&s;e it.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="030057_0133_0FE41BFE772E9A28">
"To give the monopoly of the home market to the produce of dome&s;tic indu&s;try, in any par|ticular art or manufacture, is in &s;ome mea&s;ure to direct private people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals, and mu&s;t in almo&s;t all ca&s;es, be either a u&s;ele&s;s or a hurtful regulation." &mdash;Thus far you: and I add, to limit the legal intere&s;t to a rate at which the carriers on of the olde&s;t, and be&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed, and lea&s;t hazard|ous trades are always glad to borrow, is to give the monopoly of the money market to tho&s;e traders, again&s;t the projectors of new ima|gined trades, not one of which but were it only from the circum&s;tances of its novelty, mu&s;t, as I have already ob&s;erved, appear more hazardous than the old.</P>
<P>The&s;e, in compari&s;on, are but inconclu&s;ive topics. I touched upon them merely as afford|ing, what appeared to me the only &s;hadow of a plea, that could be brought, in defence of the policy I am contending again&s;t. I come back, therefore, to my fir&s;t ground, and beg you once more to con&s;ider, whether, of all that
<PB N="140" REF="030057_0134_0FE41C01F9CBCAA8">ho&s;t of manufactures, which we both exult in as the cau&s;es and ingredients of national pro&s;perity, there be a &s;ingle one, that could have exi&s;ted at fir&s;t but in the &s;hape of a project. But, if a regulation, the tendency and effect of which is merely to check projects, in as far as they are projects, without any &s;ort of tendency, as I have &s;hewn, to weed out the bad ones, is de|fen&s;ible in its pre&s;ent &s;tate of imperfect efficacy, it &s;hould not only have been defen&s;ible, but much more worthy of our approbation, could the effi|cacy of it have been &s;o far &s;trengthened and compleated as to have oppo&s;ed, from the begin|ning, an un&s;urmountable bar to all &s;orts of pro|jects what&s;oever: that is to &s;ay, if, &s;tretching forth its hand over the rudiments of &s;ociety, it had confined us, from the beginning, to mud for our habitations, to &s;kins for our cloathing, and to acorns for our food.</P>
<P>I hope you may by this time be di&s;po&s;ed to allow me, that we have not been ill &s;erved by the projects of time pa&s;t. I have already intima|ted, that I could not &s;ee any rea&s;on why we
<PB N="141" REF="030057_0135_0FE41C03DD0A47C8">&s;hould apprehend our being wor&s;e &s;erved by the projects of time future. I will now venture to add, that I think I do &s;ee rea&s;on, why we &s;hould expect to be &s;till better and better &s;erved by the&s;e projects, than by tho&s;e. I mean better upon the whole, in virtue of the reduction which experience, if experience be worth any thing, &s;hould make in the proportion of the number of the ill-grounded and un&s;ucce&s;ful, to that of the well-grounded and &s;ucce&s;sful ones.</P>
<P>The career of art, the great road which re|ceives the foot&s;teps of projectors, may be con&s;i|dered as a va&s;t, and perhaps unbounded, plain, be&s;trewed with gulfs, &s;uch as Curtius was &s;wallowed up in. Each requires an human vic|tim to fall into it 'ere it can clo&s;e; but when it once clo&s;es, it clo&s;es to open no more, and &s;o much of the path is &s;afe to tho&s;e who follow. To tie men neck and heels, and throw them into the gulfs I have been &s;peaking of, is alto|gether out of the que&s;tion: but if, at every gulf, a Curtius &s;tands mounted and capari&s;on|ed, ready to take the leap, is it for the legi&s;lator,
<PB N="142" REF="030057_0136_0FE41C05DC8F37E0">in a fit of old womani&s;h tenderne&s;s, to pull him away? Laying even public intere&s;t out of the que&s;tion, and con&s;idering nothing but the feel|ings of individuals, a legi&s;lator would &s;carcely do &s;o, who knew the value of hope, "the mo&s;t precious gift of heaven."</P>
<P>Con&s;ider, Sir, that it is not with the inven|tion-lottery (that great branch of the project|lottery, for the &s;ake of which I am de&s;ending the whole, and mu&s;t continue &s;o to do until you or &s;omebody el&s;e can &s;hew me how to defend it on better terms), it is not, I &s;ay, with the in|vention-lottery, as with the mine-lottery, the privateering lottery, and &s;o many other lotteries, which you &s;peak of, and in no in&s;tance, I think, very much to their advantage. In the&s;e lines &s;ucce&s;s does not, as in this, ari&s;e out of the em|bers of ill &s;ucce&s;s, and thence propagate it&s;elf, by a happy contagion, perhaps to all eternity. Let Titius have found a mine, it is not the more ea&s;y, but by &s;o much the le&s;s ea&s;y, for Sempro|nius to find one too: Let Titius have made a capture, it is not the more ea&s;y, but by &s;o much
<PB N="143" REF="030057_0137_0FE41C07D52B47F0">the le&s;s ea&s;y, for Sempronius to do the like.

<P>Birmingham and Sheffield are pitched upon by you as examples, the one of a projecting town, the other of an unprojecting one, (b. I. ch. x. vol. i. p. 176, edit. 8vo. 1784.) Can you for|give my &s;aying, I rather wonder that this com|pari&s;on of your own choo&s;ing, did not &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome &s;u&s;picions of the ju&s;tice of the conceptions you had taken up, to the di&s;advantage of pro|jectors. She&s;&s;ield is an old oak: Birmingham, but a mu&s;hroom. What if we &s;hould find the mu&s;hroom &s;till va&s;ter and more vigorous than the oak? Not but the one as well as the other,
<PB N="144" REF="030057_0138_0FE41C0B693174B8">at what time &s;oever planted, mu&s;t equally have been planted by projectors: for though Tubal Cain him&s;elf were to be brought po&s;t from Ar|menia to England to plant Sheffield, Tubal Cain him&s;elf was as arrant a projector in his day, as ever Sir Thomas Lombe was, or bi&s;hop Blai&s;e: but Birmingham, it &s;eems, claims, in common parlance, the title of a projecting town, to the exclu&s;ion of the other, becau&s;e, being but of ye&s;terday, the &s;pirit of project &s;mells fre&s;her and &s;tronger there than el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>When the odious &s;ound of the word <HI>projector</HI> no longer tingles in your ears, the race of men thus &s;tigmatized do not always find you their enemy. Projects, even under the name of "dangerous and expen&s;ive experiments," are repre&s;ented as not unfit to be encouraged, even though monopoly be the means: and the mono|poly is defended in that in&s;tance, by its &s;imila|rity to the other in&s;tances, in which the like means are employed to the like purpo&s;e.</P>

"When a company of merchants undertake at their own ri&s;k and expence to e&s;tabli&s;h a new trade, with &s;ome remote and barbarous nation, it may not be unrea&s;onable (you ob&s;erve) to incorporate them into a joint &s;tock company, and to grant them, in ca&s;e of their &s;ucce&s;s, a monopoly of the trade for a certain number of years. It is the ea&s;ie&s;t and mo&s;t natural way, in which the &s;tate can recompen&s;e them, for hazarding a dangerous and expen&s;ive experi|ment, of which the public is afterwards to reap the benefit. A temporary monopoly of this kind may be vindicated, upon the &s;ame principles, upon which a like monopoly of a new machine is granted to its inventor, and that of a new book to its author."</P>
<P>I have &s;ometimes been tempted to think that were it in the power of laws to put <HI>words</HI> under pro&s;cription, as it is to put <HI>men,</HI> the cau&s;e of in|ventive indu&s;try might, perhaps, derive &s;carcely le&s;s a&s;&s;i&s;tance from a bill of attainder again&s;t the words <HI>project</HI> and <HI>projectors,</HI> than it has derived from the act authorizing the grant of patents.
<PB N="146" REF="030057_0140_0FE41C0F4D31BB38">I &s;hould add, however, for a time: for even then the envy, and vanity, and wounded pride, of the uningenious herd, would, &s;ooner or later, infu&s;e their venom into &s;ome other word, and &s;et it up as a new tyrant, to hover, like its pre|dece&s;&s;or, over the birth of infant genius, and cru&s;h it in its cradle.</P>

In my own view of the matter, indeed, no tem|perament, no middle cour&s;e, is either nece&s;&s;ary or proper: the only perfectly effectual, is the only perfectly proper remedy,&mdash;a &s;punge. But, as nothing is more common with mankind, than to give oppo&s;ite receptions, to conclu&s;ions flowing with equal nece&s;&s;ity from the &s;ame principle, let us accommodate our views to that contin|gency.</P>
<P>According to this idea, the object, as far as confined to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, &s;hould be, to pro|vide, in favour of projectors only, a di&s;pen&s;ation from the rigour of the anti-u&s;urious laws: &s;uch, for in&s;tance, as is enjoyed by per&s;ons engaged in the carrying trade, in virtue of the indulgence given to loans made on the footing of <HI>re&s;pon|dentia</HI> or bottomry.
