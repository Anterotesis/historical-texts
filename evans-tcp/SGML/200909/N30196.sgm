<P>_WHEN Error and its Advocates are &s;o bu&s;ie in pro&s;elyting the World, I know nor why a mode&s;t Confutation &s;hould be judged Criminal.

And in order to re&s;cue the Quakers from &s;o unju&s;t a Charge, I &s;hall give the Read|er a &s;hort Detail of the Principles of a Dei&s;t; and then it will be requi&s;it of the Gentleman to prove that the Quakers are Dei&s;ts, on whom the Reflections, in his Book are chief|ly thrown, which if he &s;hould fail to do, I hope he will be &s;o ju&s;t, to do as he has done before, <HI>viz.</HI> Recant</P>
<P>The Dei&s;ts deny <HI>Revealed Religion,</HI> viz.

<P>The fir&s;t Eight or Nine Pages of his Book are &s;pent, in proving. That which no Body hereabouts contradicts, <HI>viz. That the Chri&s;tian Revelation, is exellent, and nece&s;&s;ary.</HI> But the Grand Que&s;tion in Debate, is, <HI>What this Chri&s;tian Revelation is, and how made known?</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="040110_0004_10162DB3B57F34A8">
which our Author &s;eems to re&s;olve in Page <HI>10th,</HI> where he calls the Bible, <HI>The Rule of Faith, by which we ought to try our Opinions.</HI> And &s;ince the whole Tenor of his Book aims to confine all Religion to the Bible, and the external Ordinances therein contained. I &s;hall endeavor to confute, by proving, That God has &s;aved Mankind, and communicated the Knowledge of his Son &s;ufficient to Salvation without the Help of the Bible, or any of the external Ordinances therein mentioned; which if I &s;hould do, I know not why the Bible it &s;elf, and more e&s;pecialy the External Ordinances it contains, &s;hould be enumerated among the Graces e&s;&s;ential to Chri&s;tianity, on why tho&s;e who gratefully accept the Former as proceeded from the Spirit of God, and therefore under&s;tand it in a Spiritual Manner, although they di&s;allow the U&s;e of the Latter; I &s;ay, I know not why they &s;hould be loaded with fal&s;e and odious Opinions to render them vile in the Sight of the World. In order to prove the abovementioned A&s;&s;ertion, <HI>viz.</HI> That God has communicated the Know|ledge of his Son &s;ufficient to Salvation with|out the Bible, or any of the external Ordi|nances taught therein, it would be obvious for the Reader to &s;earch the Origine thereof, which if he &s;hould do, he will find no Foot|&s;teps of it in the World, till about.

to the <HI>Jews,</HI> all which Time, the mo&s;t &s;evere Formali&s;t mu&s;t grant that Mankind had no outward Revelation of the Will of God, al|though it appears by the Bible it &s;elf, That Chri&s;t was taught, and the Go&s;pel preached, as by <HI>Noah,</HI> whom the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> calls <HI>A Preacher of Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> 2 <HI>Peter</HI> 2.5.

And it is evident that he had no Bible to inform him, or communicate the Knowledge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of to him; neither had the Prophets <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> after Times, any Dictator, but the Spirit of Chri&s;t, which the Apo&s;tle &s;aith, <HI>was in them.</HI> And if we look into the Progre&s;s of the Bible, &s;ince its being compleated, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;ince Chri&s;t's Appearance upon Earth, vi&s;ibly, we &s;hall find it confined to a &s;mall Part of Mankind, with re&s;pect to tho&s;e who act without it, and among tho&s;e that act without it; we &s;hall find many who never had an Opportunity of &s;eeing it till lately, particu|larly the natural Inhabitants of this Continent, on which we now live, could not po&s;&s;ibly have &s;een it till about Two Hundred Years &s;ince; And yet it would be contrary to the Bible it &s;elf, to pronounce them all damned that died without that Opportunity, for Chri&s;t &s;peaking of the <HI>Jews,</HI> John 15.22. <HI>If I

Author would di&s;po&s;e of the greater Part or Mankind, without reviving again the <HI>Papi&s;tical Opinion</HI> of a Purgatory.</P>
<P>If the Force of the above Argument be well weighed, it might &s;erve for an effectual An&s;wer to the Authors whole work, &s;ince the whole Scope of it tends to lay upon Man|kind an unnece&s;&s;ary Burthen of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eedle&s;s Ordi|nances, without the Ob&s;ervation of which, or even the Knowledge of the Latter of the Bible it &s;elf Salvation may be obtained; and if &s;o, By what Force of Rea&s;on? By what Divine Warrant do they confine the Almighty God to particular Methods of Salvation? And &s;uch Methods too, as he him&s;elf &s;aith he will &s;ave no Man by, <HI>viz. An outward Law of Works.</HI> Is it not more agreeable to the Nature of God and the Scope of the Scriptures to conclude with the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter Acts</HI> 10.34, 35. <HI>Of a Truth I perceive God is no re&s;pecter of Per&s;ons; but in every Nation he that feareth him and worketh Righteou&s;ne&s;s is accepted with him,</HI></P>
<P>Thus is the Doctrine of Chri&s;ts being com|municated to Mankind without humane or external Aid, once and for ever e&s;tabli&s;hed. And tho' this Gentleman, with others, may think that the unovoidable Con&s;equences of the above Argument may tend to place the Bible a Degree lower in the E&s;teem of

Mankind; but &s;uch I mu&s;t take leave to tell that it is now &s;et in the Place of God, by this Gentleman and his Adherents; for in it we are told That the Spirit of God co|habits with Ju&s;t Men as, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.16. <HI>Know ye not that ye are the Temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</HI> And if &s;o, Why &s;hould we bring the Dictates of &s;o divine an In&s;tructor to the Bible for Proof.

I &s;ay, That here God &s;ignifies him&s;elf to be a God that can forgive Sin, tho' this Gentle|man &s;aith he will not, until he has received Satisfaction, which is no Forgivene&s;s at all And would it not likewi&s;e follow, That if the Doctrine of the Trinity be true (that

is, if the Father and the Son are one) that the Son mu&s;t make Satisfaction to him&s;elf which is ab&s;urd; but allowing him to have made Satisfaction, he being one with and o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;ame Nature as the Father, can no mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> forgive Sin than the Father: Therefore, the Debt remains as due, both to the Father and Son, they being one, as ever.</P>
<P>But the Gentleman, to prove this Matter conjures up an Argument that he will be puzzled to &s;et a&s;ide, although he thinks he has done it, which is, <Q>That it was unju&s;t for Chri&s;t, who was Righteous, to &s;uffer for the Wicked;</Q> "the Force of which he pretended|ly ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">des, by &s;aying, That Chri&s;t &s;uffered as Surety, and not as Principal; but I ad|mire at the Gentleman's Weakne&s;s for al|lowing it to be &s;o!

<PB N="15" REF="040110_0008_10162DBD300FD158">
Satisfaction mu&s;t be Puni&s;hment: Then it mu&s;t certainly follow, That God mu&s;t delight in puni&s;hing the Innocent; for, whoever be|comes Man's Surety mu&s;t make Satisfaction, and if the Satisfaction be &s;uch, That who|ever makes it mu&s;t be made infinitly mi&s;er|able; and that God has &s;aid, as I have already poved, <HI>That non &s;hall be puni&s;hed or made mi&s;erable by him, but the Wicked.</HI> But his Inno|cent Son in making Satisfaction is made mi&s;erable, and puni&s;hed by him: It mu&s;t certainly follow, That Guilt was found on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nnocent Son of God, or, That God has acted contrary to his own Decree, neither of which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay be admitted, without allowing the mo&s;t horrid Bla&s;phemy, and &s;uch &s;trange and a&s;|toni&s;hing Incongruities mu&s;t unque&s;tionably <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rgue, the mo&s;t extravigant Degree of In|ju&s;tice in the Deity, Ble&s;&s;ed for ever more.
