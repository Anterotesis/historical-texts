<HEAD>Serious CONSIDERATIONS On <HI>Ab&s;olute Prede&s;tination.</HI></HEAD>
<P>GOD out of his Infinite Love, who <HI>delighteth not in the Death of a Sinner, but that all &s;hould live and be &s;aved, hath given his only Son, to the end that who&s;oever believeth on him, &s;hou'd not peri&s;h, but have ever|la&s;ting Life: He is the true Light, who enlightneth every Man that cometh into the World.</HI> And this Light would work out the Salvation of All, if not re&s;i&s;ted. Nor is it le&s;s <HI>Univer&s;al</HI> than inbred Sin, being the Purcha&s;e of his Death who <HI>ta&s;ted Death for every Man.</HI> For <HI>as in</HI> Adam <HI>all died, even &s;o in</HI> CHRIST <HI>&s;hall all be made alive.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. But &s;ome are not afraid to a&s;&s;ert, That <HI>GOD by an Eternal and unchangable Decree hath prede&s;tinated to Eter|nal Damnation the far greater Part of Mankind, and that ab&s;olutely, without any re&s;pect to their Works, but only for the &s;hewing the Glory of his Ju&s;tice: And that for the bring|ing this about, he hath appointed the&s;e mi&s;erable Souls nece&s;|&s;arily to walk in their wicked Ways, that &s;o his Ju&s;tice may lay hold on them: And that he ju&s;tly condemns the&s;e, altho' he hath withheld from them that Grace by which alone they could have laid hold of Salvation, as having decreed, (with|out any re&s;pect to their Works) That they &s;hall not obey, and that the Go&s;pel which he publickly invites them to accept, &s;hall never prove effectual for their Salvation, but only &s;erve to aggravate their Guilt, and occa&s;ion their greater Damna|tion.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. We may &s;afely call this Doctrine a Novelty, &s;eeing in the fir&s;t four hundred Years after Chri&s;t, there is no
<PB N="3" REF="005310_0003_1016FB34D0351BE0">
Mention made of it, by any Writer, great or &s;mall, in any Part of the Chri&s;tian Church. For, as it is contrary to the Te&s;timony of Scripture, and to the Tenor of the Go&s;pel, &s;o all the antient Writers, Teachers and Doctors of the Church, pa&s;s it over with a profound Silence. The fir&s;t Foundations of it were laid, in the latter Writings of <HI>Augu&s;tine;</HI> who in his Heat again&s;t <HI>Pelagius,</HI> let fall &s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions, which &s;ome have unhappily glean'd up, for the e&s;tabli&s;hing of this Error; thereby contradicting many others and many more, and frequent Expre&s;&s;ions of the &s;ame <HI>Augu&s;tine.</HI> It was afterwards taught by <HI>Dominicus,</HI> a <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Frier, and the <HI>Monks</HI> of his Order, and at la&s;t it was unhappily taken up by <HI>John Calvin,</HI> (otherwi&s;e a Man in divers re&s;pects to be commended) to the great &s;taining of his Reputation, and Defamation both of the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> and of the Chri&s;tian Religion. However we &s;hould not reject it for the Silence of the Antients, if it had any real Bottom in the Word of GOD; and if it were not <HI>highly injurious to GOD him&s;elf,</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>our Mediator and Redeemer, to the Power, Virtue, Nobility and Excellen|cy of his Ble&s;&s;ed Go&s;pel, and la&s;tly, to All Mankind.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Fir&s;t, <HI>It is highly injurious to GOD,</HI> becau&s;e it makes him the Author of Sin. I confe&s;s the A&s;&s;ertors of this Doctrine deny this Con&s;equence of it: But that is but a meer Illu&s;ion, and is equally ridiculous, as if a Man &s;hould deny, that <HI>two</HI> and <HI>two</HI> makes <HI>four.</HI> For if GOD has decreed, that the Reprobated &s;hall Peri&s;h, and if he hath al&s;o decreed that they &s;hou'd walk in tho&s;e wicked Ways, by which they are led to that End: Who, I pray, is the fir&s;t Author and Cau&s;e thereof but GOD, who &s;o willed and decreed? This is as plain and natural a Con&s;equence, as any can po&s;&s;ibly be. And therefore altho' many of the Preachers of this Doctrine have &s;ought out various &s;trange, &s;train'd and intricate Di&s;tinctions to avoid it, yet &s;ome, and that of the mo&s;t eminent among them, have openly acknowledg'd it. I &s;hall in&s;tance a few among many Pa&s;&s;ages. <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Calvin</HI> in cap. 3. <HI>Gen. Id.</HI> 1 In&s;t. c. 18. S. 1. <HI>Id.</HI> Lib. de.

<P N="5">5. If the&s;e Sayings do not import, That GOD is <HI>the Author of Sin,</HI> we mu&s;t not then &s;eek the&s;e Men's Opi|nions from their Words, but &s;ome Way el&s;e. It &s;eems as if they had a&s;&s;umed to them&s;elves that mon&s;trous, two|fold Will they feign of GOD: One by which they <HI>declare</HI> their Minds openly, and another more <HI>Secret</HI> and <HI>Hidden,</HI> which is quite contrary to the other. Nor doth it at all help them to &s;ay, That Man &s;ins <HI>willingly;</HI> &s;ince that <HI>Willingne&s;s</HI> to Sin is (according to their Judgment) &s;o nece&s;&s;arily impo&s;ed upon him, that he cannot but be Willing, becau&s;e God hath willed and decreed him to be &s;o. This Shift is ju&s;t as if I &s;hould take a Child unable to re&s;i&s;t me, and throw it down from a high Precipice. The Weight of its Body indeed makes it go readily down, and the Violence of the Fall beats out its Brains and kills it. But tho' the Weight of its Body and not any imme|diate
<PB N="5" REF="005310_0005_1016FB39245289C8">
Stroke of my Hand makes the Child die; whether is the Child or I the proper Cau&s;e of its Death? Let then any Man judge, whether they who make GOD's Part as great, and more immediate, in the Sins of Men, do not make GOD <HI>the Author of Sin,</HI> and &s;o are highly injurious to him?</P>
<P N="6">6. Secondly, This Doctrine is <HI>injurious to GOD, be|cau&s;e it makes him delight in the Death of Sinners,</HI> contrary to the Expre&s;s Words of GOD him&s;elf. <HI>As I live, &s;aith the Lord GOD, I have no Plea&s;ure in the Death of the Wicked, but that the Wicked turn from his Way and live. Turn ye, turn ye from your evil Ways: For why will ye die, O Hou&s;e of I&s;rael?</HI> Ezek. xxxiii. 11. <HI>This is good and acceptable in the Sight of GOD our Saviour: Who willeth all Men to be &s;aved, and to come unto the Knowledge of the Truth.</HI> 1. Tim. ii. 4. <HI>The Lord is long-&s;uffering, not willing that any &s;hou'd Peri&s;h, but that all &s;hou'd come unto Repentance.</HI> But if he hath created Men only for this very End, that he might &s;hew forth his Vengeance upon them (as the&s;e Men affirm) and for effecting this End, hath with held from them that Grace, whereby alone they could be &s;aved from peri&s;hing, yea and al&s;o prede&s;tinated the Evil, that they might fall into it; certainly he mu&s;t <HI>delight in their Death,</HI> contrary to his own expre&s;s Decla|ration.</P>
<P N="7">7. Thirdly, <HI>This Doctrine is highly injurious to</HI> CHRIST <HI>our Mediator, and to the Efficacy and Excellency of his Go&s;|pel.</HI> For it &s;uppo&s;es his Mediation to be nece&s;&s;arily of none effect, with regard to the Salvation of the Greater Part of the World: As if he had not by his Sufferings and Death throughly <HI>broken down the middle Wall,</HI> nor yet removed the <HI>Wrath of GOD,</HI> or purcha&s;ed the Love of GOD for all Mankind: As if it was afore decreed, that it &s;hould be of no Service, to the far greater Part of Mankind. And it is to no Purpo&s;e to &s;ay, That his Death was of Efficacy enough to have &s;aved all Mankind; if in effect its Virtue be not &s;o far extended, as to put all Mankind into a Capacity of Salvation.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="6" REF="005310_0006_1016FB3AB6748188">8. Fourthly, <HI>It makes the Preaching of the Go&s;pel a meer Mock and Illu&s;ion,</HI> if many of tho&s;e to whom it is preached, are by an irrevocable Decree, &s;hut out from being beni|fited by it. It wholly makes u&s;ele&s;s the preaching of Faith and Repentance, and the whole Tenor of the Go&s;pel Promi&s;es and Threatings. For if &s;uch a Decree be al|ready pa&s;t, Man needs do nothing but wait for <HI>Irre&s;i&s;table Grace:</HI> Which if he be <HI>Elected,</HI> will come, tho' it be but at his la&s;t Hour: And if he be <HI>Reprobated,</HI> will never come, be his Diligence and waiting what it can.</P>
<P N="9">9. Fifthly, <HI>This Doctrine makes the coming of</HI> CHRIST <HI>and his Sacrifice on the Cro&s;s, which the Scripture affirms to have been the Fruit of GOD's Love to the World, to have been rather a Te&s;timony of GOD's Wrath to the World, yea one of the greate&s;t Judgments and Severe&s;t Acts that can be conceiv'd of GOD's Indignation toward Mankind:</HI> It being only ordain'd (according to this Doctrine) to &s;ave a very few, and for the hardening and increa&s;ing the Damnation of the far greater Number of Men, namely of all tho&s;e who do not truly believe: The Cau&s;e of which Unbelief a|gain, (as the&s;e Divines, &s;o called, above a&s;&s;ert) is the hidden Coun&s;el of GOD. Certainly then the coming of CHRIST was never to them a Te&s;timony of GOD's Love, but rather of his implacable Wrath: And if the World may be taken for the far greater Number of &s;uch as live in it, GOD never loved the World, according to this Doctrine, but rather hated it greatly, in &s;ending his Son to be crucified in it.</P>
<P N="10">10. Sixthly, <HI>This Doctrine is highly injurious</HI> to Mankind; for it renders them in a far wor&s;e Condition than the De|vils in Hell. For the&s;e were &s;ome time in a Capacity to have &s;tood: They might have kept their happy E&s;tate but would not: Whereas many Millions of Men are tor|mented for ever, according to them, who never were hap|py, nor ever can be. It renders them in a wor&s;e State than the Bea&s;ts of the Field, of whom the Ma&s;ter requires no more than they are able to perform, and if they be killed, Death is to them the End of all Sorrow: Whereas
<PB N="7" REF="005310_0007_1016FB3D90FF2688">
Man is in Pain without End, for not doing that which he never was able to do. It puts him into a far wor&s;e Condition than <HI>Pharaoh</HI> put the <HI>I&s;raelites:</HI> For tho' he with|held Straw from them, yet they could get it by much Labour. But they make GOD to withhold from Men all Means of Salvation, &s;o that they cannot attain it by all their Pains. Yea, they place Mankind in that Condition which the Poets feign of <HI>Tantalus:</HI> Who oppre&s;t with Thir&s;t, &s;tands in Water up to the Chin, yet can by no Means reach it with his Tongue; and being tormented with Hunger, hath Fruits hanging at his very Lips, yet &s;o as he can never lay hold of them with his Teeth. And the&s;e Things are &s;o near him, not to nouri&s;h him, but to torment him. So do the&s;e Teachers make GOD deal with Mankind. They make the outward Creation, the Works of Providence, the Smitings of Con&s;cience, &s;uffi|cient to convince the Reprobates of Sin, but never inten|ded to help them to Salvation. They make the Preach|ing of the Go&s;pel, and the offer of Salvation by CHRIST &s;ufficient to condemn them; &s;erving to beget a &s;eeming Faith and a vain Hope; yet by Rea&s;on of GOD's Irre|&s;i&s;tible Decree, all the&s;e (&s;ay they) are wholly ineffec|tual to bring them the lea&s;t Step towards Salvation, and do only contribute to make their Condemnation the greater, and their Torments the more violent and in|tolerable.</P>
<P N="11">11. In direct Oppo&s;ition to this we affirm, That <HI>GOD out of his infinite Love, who delighteth not in the Death of a Sinner, but that all &s;hould live and be &s;aved, hath &s;ent his only begotten Son into the World, that who&s;o|ever believeth in him might be &s;aved.</HI> This Doctrine is &s;o evident from the Scripture Te&s;timony, that there is &s;carce found any other Article of the Chri&s;tian Faith, &s;o fre|quently, &s;o plainly and &s;o po&s;itively a&s;&s;erted. It is that which maketh the preaching of CHRIST to be indeed the Go&s;pel, or <HI>Glad Tidings to All;</HI> as the Angel declared his coming to be, (<HI>Luke,</HI> ii. 10.) <HI>Behold I bring You Good Tidings of Great Joy which &s;hall be to all People.</HI> Whereas
<PB N="8" REF="005310_0008_1016FB430AC17E88">
if this Coming of CHRIST had not brought a Po&s;&s;ibility of Salvation <HI>to all,</HI> it &s;hould rather have been accounted <HI>Bad Tidings of great Sorrow to mo&s;t People.</HI> Neither would the Angel have had Rea&s;on to &s;ing, <HI>Peace on Earth and Good Will towards Men,</HI> if the Greate&s;t Part of Mankind had been nece&s;&s;arily &s;hut out from receiving any Benefit from it. And indeed if &s;o, how &s;hould CHRIST have &s;ent out his Servants to <HI>preach the Go&s;pel to every Creature?</HI> that is, To every Son and Daughter of Mankind; for here is no Exception. He commands them to <HI>preach Salvation to All, Repentance and Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins to All, warning every one and exhorting every one</HI> as <HI>Paul</HI> did, <HI>Col.</HI> i. 28. But how cou'd they have preached the Go&s;pel <HI>to every Man,</HI> as became the Mini&s;ters of CHRIST, <HI>in much A&s;&s;urance,</HI> if Salvation by that Go&s;pel had not been po&s;&s;ible to All? What if &s;ome of tho&s;e had a&s;ked them, <HI>Hath</HI> CHRIST <HI>died for Me?</HI> Should they have an&s;wered conditionally, <HI>If thou repent,</HI> CHRIST <HI>died for Thee?</HI> The &s;ame Que&s;tion would have recurr'd, <HI>Hath</HI> CHRIST <HI>died for Me that I may repent? Otherwi&s;e My Repen|tance is impo&s;&s;ible.</HI> To this nothing could be an&s;wer'd but the &s;ame thing over again. Whereas tho&s;e who <HI>bring the Glad Tidings of the Go&s;pel of Peace,</HI> are to preach the <HI>Common Salvation,</HI> Repentance unto All, of|fering a Door of Mercy and Hope to All, thro' JESUS CHRIST, <HI>who gave him&s;elf a Ran&s;om for All.</HI> The Go&s;|pel invites All. And certainly CHRIST intended not to deceive and delude the Greater Part of Mankind, when he invites and cries, &s;aying, <HI>Come unto me all Ye that are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give You Re&s;t.</HI> If <HI>All</HI> then ought to &s;eek after him, and to look for Salvation by him, he mu&s;t needs have made <HI>Salvation po&s;&s;ible to All.</HI> For who is bound to &s;eek after that which is impo&s;&s;ible? Certainly it were a Mocking of Men to bid them to do &s;o. And &s;uch as deny, that by the Death of CHRIST <HI>Salva|tion is</HI> made po&s;&s;ible to All Men, do mo&s;t bla&s;phemou&s;ly make GOD mock the World, in giving his Servants a Commi&s;&s;ion <HI>to preach the Go&s;pel of Salvation unto</HI> All,
<PB N="9" REF="005310_0009_1016FB45E39081E8">
while he hath before decreed, that it &s;hall not be po&s;&s;ible for them to receive it. Do not they make the LORD to &s;end forth his Servants <HI>with a Lie in their Mouth,</HI> command|ing them, to bid <HI>All</HI> and <HI>every one</HI> believe, that CHRIST died for Them, and had purchas'd Salvation for them: Whereas (according to this Doctrine) he hath done no &s;uch thing, or ever intended it? Seeing then CHRIST hath commanded to preach <HI>Repentance and Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins to All,</HI> it is certain that <HI>he died for All:</HI> And that it is po&s;&s;ible for all to repent and believe. In as much as he who commi&s;&s;ion'd his Servants thus to preach, is a GOD of Truth and no Mocker of poor Mankind, neither doth he require of any Man, that which it is &s;imply impo&s;&s;ible for him to do.</P>
<P N="12">12. Moreover, if we regard the Te&s;timony of the Scripture, there is not, that I know of, one Scripture which affirms, CHRIST <HI>did not die for All,</HI> whereas there are divers Scriptures which po&s;itively and expre&s;sly affirm, <HI>He did.</HI> As 1. <HI>Tim.</HI> ii. 1, 3, 4, 6. <HI>I exhort therefore that fir&s;t of all Supplications, Prayers, Interce&s;&s;ions and giving of Thanks be made for all Men, &amp;c. For this is good and acceptable in the Sight of GOD our Saviour, who will have all Men to be &s;aved and to come to the Knowledge of the Truth&mdash;Who gave him&s;elf a Ran&s;om for all, to be te&s;tified in due time.</HI> Except we make the Apo&s;tle to a&s;&s;ert quite another thing than he meant there can be noth|ing more plain than this. For fir&s;t he here directs them <HI>To pray for all Men;</HI> and to prevent &s;uch an Objection as this, CHRIST <HI>prayed not for the World, neither willeth he us to pray for all: Becau&s;e he willeth not that all &s;hould be &s;aved, but hath ordain'd many to be damned,</HI> he adds, <HI>This is good and acceptable with GOD who willeth all Men to be &s;aved.</HI> I de&s;ire to know what can be more ex|pre&s;sly affirmed? Or, can any Two Propo&s;itions be &s;tated in Terms more contradictory, than the&s;e Two,</P>
<P><HI>GOD willeth not &s;ome Men to be &s;aved,</HI> and</P>
<P><HI>GOD willeth all Men to be &s;aved?</HI></P>
<P>If we believe the la&s;t, as the Apo&s;tle hath affirmed, the
<PB N="10" REF="005310_0010_1016FB47B95E4F50">
fir&s;t cannot be true. Whence (to conclude) he gives us a Rea&s;on of CHRIST'S Willingne&s;s that all Men &s;hould be &s;aved, in the&s;e Words, <HI>Who gave him&s;elf a Ran&s;om for all.</HI> As if he had &s;aid, &s;ince he gave him&s;elf a Ran&s;om for All, it is plain he willeth all Men to be &s;aved.</P>
<P N="13">13. The &s;ame thing is po&s;itively affirmed, <HI>Heb.</HI> ii. 9. <HI>We &s;ee</HI> JESUS <HI>who was made a little lower than the Angels, for the &s;uffering of Death, crown'd with Glory and Honour, that he by the Grace of GOD might ta&s;te Death for every Man.</HI> He that will but open his Eyes, may &s;ee this Truth here a&s;&s;erted. If <HI>he ta&s;ted Death for every Man,</HI> then certainly there is no Man for whom he did not ta&s;te Death; and then there is no Man who may not be made a Sharer of the Benefit of it.</P>
<P N="14">14. Again, Our LORD him&s;elf &s;ays, <HI>He came not to condemn the World, but that the World thro' him might be &s;aved. John</HI> iii. 17. And <HI>John</HI> xii. 47. <HI>He came not to judge the World, but to &s;ave the World:</HI> Whereas, ac|cording to that Doctrine, he <HI>did</HI> come rather to condemn the World, and not that it might be &s;aved by him. For if he did not come to bring Salvation to the greater Part of Mankind, but to increa&s;e their Condemnation, it nece&s;|&s;arily follows, That he did not come with an Intention to &s;ave, but to judge and condemn the greater Part of the World, contrary to his expre&s;s Te&s;timony.</P>
<P N="15">15. Yet again, as the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> a&s;&s;erts, That GOD <HI>willeth the Salvation of all,</HI> &s;o doth the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> a&s;&s;ert, That he <HI>willeth not the peri&s;hing of any,</HI> 2. Pet. iii. 9. <HI>The</HI> LORD <HI>is not &s;lack concerning his Pro|mi&s;e, as &s;ome Men count Slackne&s;s: But is long &s;uffering to us-ward, not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h, but that all &s;hou'd come to Repentance.</HI> And this is agreeable to that of the Prophet <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> xxxiii. 11. <HI>As I live, &s;aith the Lord, I have no Plea&s;ure in the Death of the Wicked, but that the Wicked turn from his Way and live.</HI> Now if it be &s;afe to believe GOD, we mu&s;t not think, that he intends to cheat us by all the&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions, but that he is in good Earne&s;t. And if his Will take not Effect, the blame is
<PB N="11" REF="005310_0011_1016FB4B44296630">
on our Parts; which could not be if CHRIST had never died for us but left us under an Impo&s;&s;ibility of Salvation. What mean all tho&s;e earne&s;t Invitations, all tho&s;e regret|ting Expo&s;tulations the Scripture is full of? As <HI>Why will Ye die, O Hou&s;e of I&s;rael? They</HI> will <HI>not come unto me that they might have Life. I have waited to be gracious unto You. How often would I have gather'd You, and Ye would not?</HI> Are Men who are &s;o invited under no Capacity of being &s;aved? Is Salvation impo&s;&s;ible to them. Will you then &s;uppo&s;e GOD in this to be only like the Author of a <HI>Romance,</HI> or Ma&s;ter of a <HI>Comedy,</HI> who amu&s;es and rai&s;es the various Affections and Pa&s;&s;ions of the Spectators: Sometimes leading them into Hope, and &s;ometimes into De&s;pair; All this being, in effect, but a meer Illu&s;ion, while he hath appointed what the Conclu&s;ion of all &s;hall be?</P>
<P N="16">16. Farther yet; This Doctrine is abundantly con|firmed by that of the Apo&s;tle, 1 <HI>John</HI> ii. 1, 2. <HI>If any Man &s;in, we have an Advocate with the Father,</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>the Righteous: And he is the Propitiation for our Sins; and not for ours only, but al&s;o for the Sins of the Whole World.</HI> The Way which our Adver&s;aries take to evade this Te&s;timony, is mo&s;t fooli&s;h and ridiculous. <HI>The World here,</HI> &s;ay they, <HI>is the World of Believers:</HI> For which we have nothing but their own A&s;&s;ertion. For fir&s;t, let them &s;hew me, if they can, in all the Scripture, where <HI>the whole World</HI> is taken for Believers only. I &s;hall &s;hew them, where it is many times taken for the quite contrary, as, <HI>The World knoweth me not: The World receiveth me not: I am not of this World.</HI> Be&s;ides all the&s;e Scriptures, <HI>P&s;alm</HI> xvii. 14. <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> xiii. 11. <HI>Matth.</HI> xviii. 7. <HI>John</HI> vii. 7. and viii. 26. and xii. 19. and xiv. 17. and xv. 18, 19. and xvii. 14. and xviii. 20. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> i. 21. and ii. 12. and vi. 2. <HI>Gal.</HI> vi. 14. <HI>James</HI> i. 27. 2 <HI>Peter</HI> ii. 20. 1 <HI>John</HI> ii. 15. and iii. 1. and iv. 4, 5. and many more. Secondly, The Apo&s;tle in this very Place contradi&s;tingui&s;hes the <HI>World</HI> from the <HI>Saints</HI> thus, <HI>And not for Ours only, but for the Sins of the whole World.</HI> What means the Apo&s;tle by
<PB N="12" REF="005310_0012_1016FB4F67464E58">
<HI>Ours</HI> here? Is not that the Sins of Believers? Was not he one of tho&s;e Believers? And was not this an Univer&s;al Epi&s;tle, written to all the Saints that then were? So that according to the&s;e Men's Comment, there wou'd be a very unnece&s;&s;ary and fooli&s;h Redundancy in the Apo&s;tle's Words, as if he had &s;aid, <HI>He is a Propitiation not only for the Sins of all Believers, but al&s;o for the Sins of all Believers.</HI> Is not this to make the Apo&s;tle's Words Non&s;en&s;e? Let them &s;hew us, where ever there is &s;uch a Manner of Speaking in all the Scripture; where any of the Penmen fir&s;t name the <HI>Believers</HI> together with them&s;elves, and then contra|di&s;tingui&s;h them from &s;ome other <HI>whole VVorld of Be|lievers.</HI></P>
<P N="17">17. But we need no better Interpreter for the Apo&s;tle than him&s;elf, who u&s;es the very &s;ame Expre&s;&s;ion in the &s;ame Epi&s;tle, c. v. 19. Saying, <HI>We know</HI> that we <HI>are of GOD and</HI> the whole World <HI>lieth in VVickedne&s;s.</HI> There cannot be found in all the Scripture, Two Places which better an&s;wer one another: Seeing in both the &s;ame Apo&s;tle in the &s;ame Epi&s;tle, to the &s;ame Per&s;ons, con|tradi&s;tingui&s;hes <HI>him&s;elf and the Saints to whom he writes</HI> from <HI>the whole VVorld:</HI> which yet according to the&s;e Men's Comments ought to be under&s;tood of <HI>Believers;</HI> as if St. <HI>John</HI> had &s;aid, <HI>VVe know Particular Believers are of GOD, but the whole VVorld of Believers lieth in VVicked|ne&s;s.</HI> What ab&s;urd wre&s;ting of Scripture were this? And yet it may be as well pleaded for as the other. Seeing then the Apo&s;tle tells us plainly, That CHRIST died not only for the Church of GOD to whom he wrote, but al&s;o <HI>for the whole VVorld,</HI> let us hold fa&s;t this Truth, which we have received not of Men but of GOD.</P>
<P N="18">18. But in order to make it yet more plain, we &s;hall &s;hew the&s;e two Things.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>That GOD hath given to every Man born into the VVorld, a Time or Day of Vi&s;itation, during which they may be &s;aved.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>That for this End, he hath given to every Man, a Mea&s;ure of Light and Grace, which if it is not
<PB N="13" REF="005310_0013_1016FB50ECDD90B0">
re&s;i&s;ted will work the Salvation of All; but if it is, will be|come their Condemnation.</HI></P>
<P N="19">19. Now according to this Doctrine, <HI>the Mercy of GOD is excellently well &s;et forth,</HI> in that none are nece&s;|&s;arily &s;hut out from Salvation; and his <HI>Ju&s;tice,</HI> in that he condemns none but &s;uch as might have been &s;aved and wou'd not.</P>
<P>This Doctrine <HI>agrees with the whole Tenor of the Go&s;pel,</HI> wherein Repentance and Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins are comman|ded to be preach'd to every Creature.</P>
<P>It <HI>magnifies the Merits and Death of</HI> CHRIST, in that it not only accounts them &s;ufficient to &s;ave All, but de|clares them to be brought &s;o nigh to All, that they are thereby put into a Capacity of Salvation.</P>
<P>It <HI>exalts above all the Grace of GOD,</HI> to which it at|tributes All Good, a&s;cribing thereto not only the fir&s;t Mo|tions of Good, but al&s;o the whole Conver&s;ion and Sal|vation of the Soul.</P>
<P>As <HI>it makes the whole Salvation of Man to depend upon GOD, &s;o it makes his Condemnation to be wholly of him|&s;elf,</HI> in that he re&s;i&s;ted the Grace of GOD, and when he might have been &s;aved, wou'd not.</P>
<P>It <HI>takes away all Ground of De&s;pair,</HI> in that it gives every Man cau&s;e to hope for Salvation, <HI>nor yet doth it feed any one in Security,</HI> in that none know how &s;oon their Day may expire: And therefore, it is a compleat Incitement and lively Encouragement to every Man, to for&s;ake Evil and clo&s;e with that which is Good.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, <HI>It is really and in effect,</HI> tho' not in &s;o many Words, <HI>confirm'd and e&s;tabli&s;h'd by all the Preachers of the Chri&s;tian Religion, that ever were, or now are,</HI> even by tho&s;e who otherwi&s;e oppo&s;e this Doctrine: In that they all, what&s;oever Place they come to, do preach to the People and to every Individual among them, that they may be &s;aved, intreating them to believe in CHRIST, who hath died for them. So that what they deny in the general, they acknowledge of every Parti|cular; there being no Man to whom they do not preach,
<PB N="14" REF="005310_0014_1016FB53C31A6B18">
in order to Salvation, telling him JESUS CHRIST <HI>calls and wills him to believe and be &s;aved:</HI> And that if he refu&s;e he &s;hall therefore be condemn'd, and his Condemnation is of him&s;elf. Such is the Power of Truth, that it con|&s;trains its Adver&s;aries, even again&s;t their Wills to plead for it.</P>
<P N="20">20. We do not indeed by <HI>this Day of Vi&s;itation,</HI> un|der&s;tand the whole time of a Man's Life; tho' in &s;ome it may be extended to the very Hour of Death: But <HI>&s;uch a Sea&s;on,</HI> at lea&s;t, <HI>as &s;ufficiently clears GOD of every Man's Condemnation,</HI> which to &s;ome may be &s;ooner, and to others later, according as the LORD in his Wi&s;|dom &s;ees meet. So that many Men may, out-live this Day, after which GOD <HI>&s;uffers</HI> them to be <HI>hardned,</HI> as a ju&s;t Puni&s;hment of their wilful Unbelief, and even <HI>rai&s;es them up</HI> as In&s;truments of Wrath, and makes them a Scourge one again&s;t another. To Men in this Condition may be fitly applied tho&s;e Scriptures, which are abu&s;ed to prove, That GOD con&s;trains Men to &s;in. This is plainly expre&s;s'd by the Apo&s;tle. <HI>Rom.</HI> i. from v. 17. to the end: But e&s;pecially v. 28. <HI>Even as they did not like to retain GOD in their Knowledge, GOD gave them up to a Reprobate Mind, to do tho&s;e Things which are not conveni|ent.</HI> And that many outlive the Day of their Vi&s;itation, appears by CHRIST'S weeping over <HI>Jeru&s;alem, Luke</HI> xix. 42. &s;aying, <HI>If thou had&s;t known in this thy Day the Things that belong unto thy Peace! But now they are hid from thy Eyes:</HI> This plainly imports a time when they might have known them, which now was removed from them.</P>
<P N="21">21. But tho' we affirm there is a time given to all, wherein they <HI>may</HI> be &s;aved, yet we deny not &s;uch Grace may be given to Some, that they <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be &s;aved. There may be &s;ome in whom the Grace of GOD &s;o worketh, that they <HI>cannot re&s;i&s;t it.</HI> But there are none in whom it doth not work &s;o that they might be &s;aved, if they did not wilfully reject Salvation.</P>
<P N="22">22. By the&s;e Po&s;itions, two Great Objections are ea&s;ily &s;olved. The fir&s;t is brought from tho&s;e Places of Scrip|ture,
<PB N="15" REF="005310_0015_1016FB55562B4718">
wherein GOD &s;eems to have prede&s;tinated &s;ome to Salvation. We grant he has: So here is no Difficulty at all. The Second is drawn from tho&s;e Places, wherein GOD &s;eems to have prede&s;tinated &s;ome to De&s;truction; becau&s;e he is &s;aid, <HI>To harden their Hearts,</HI> and to have <HI>rai&s;ed them up, that they might cau&s;e his Power to be known.</HI> But if they be number'd among tho&s;e Men, who&s;e Day of Vi&s;itation is over, this Objection al&s;o is at an end.</P>
<P N="23">23. We come now more directly to &s;hew, <HI>That GOD hath given to every Man a Day or Time of Vi&s;itation, where|in it is po&s;&s;ible for him to be &s;aved.</HI> Now if we prove that, there is a Time or Day given, in which tho&s;e might have been &s;aved, who actually peri&s;h, the Matter is done. (For none deny that tho&s;e who are &s;aved have a Day of Vi&s;itation) And this appears by the Complaints the Spirit of GOD, thro'out the whole Scripture, makes, even to tho&s;e that did Peri&s;h, challenging them for not accept|ing GOD's Vi&s;itation and offer'd Mercy. Thus the LORD expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf fir&s;t of all to <HI>Cain,</HI> Gen. iv. 6, 7. <HI>And the</HI> LORD <HI>&s;aid unto Cain, why art thou wroth, and why is thy Countenance fallen? If thou do&s;t well, &s;halt Thou not be accepted? If thou do&s;t not well, Sin lieth at the Door.</HI> This was &s;aid to <HI>Cain,</HI> before he &s;lew his Brother. We &s;ee how GOD gave him Warning; and offer'd, in the Day of his Vi&s;itation, Acceptance if he did well. For tho&s;e Words, <HI>Shalt thou not be accepted?</HI> mu&s;t import, <HI>Thou &s;halt be accepted, if thou doe&s;t well.</HI> So that if we may tru&s;t GOD, the Fountain of all Truth, there was a Day in which it was po&s;&s;ible, even for <HI>Cain</HI> to be accepted. The LORD him&s;elf al&s;o &s;hews, That he gave a Day of Vi&s;i|tation to <HI>the old World, Gen.</HI> vi. 3. <HI>And the</HI> LORD <HI>&s;aid, my Spirit &s;hall not always &s;trive with Man:</HI> Manife&s;tly implying, That his Spirit did &s;trive with him for a Sea|&s;on, which Sea&s;on expiring, GOD ceas'd to &s;trive with him in order to his Salvation. From this Day of Vi&s;ita|tion which GOD hath given to many, it is, that he is &s;aid to <HI>wait to be gracious, I&s;ai.</HI> xxx. 18 And to be <HI>long-&s;uf|fering, Exod.</HI> xxxiv. 6. <HI>Numb.</HI> xiv. 18. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> lxxxvi. 15.

and <HI>Jer.</HI> xv. 15. where the Prophet in his Prayer lays hold on the <HI>Long-&s;uffering of GOD;</HI> and in his Expo&s;|tulating with GOD, he &s;huts out the Objection of our Adver&s;aries in the 18th Ver&s;e, <HI>Why is my Pain perpetual and my Wound incurable, which refu&s;eth to be healed? Wilt Thou altogether be unto me as a Liar and as Waters that fail?</HI> Whereas, according to our Adver&s;aries Opinion, <HI>the Pain</HI> of the mo&s;t Part of Men is <HI>perpetual,</HI> and <HI>their Wound altogether incurable.</HI> Yea the Offer of Salvation unto them is <HI>as a Lie and as Waters that fail,</HI> being ne|ver intended to be of any Effect unto them. The A|po&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> &s;ays expre&s;sly, That this <HI>Long &s;uffering of GOD waited in the Days of</HI> Noah, <HI>for tho&s;e of the Old World;</HI> an&s;werably to <HI>Gen.</HI> vi. 3. And that none may object that this <HI>Long-&s;uffering</HI> or <HI>&s;triving of the</HI> LORD was not in order to their Salvation, the &s;ame Apo&s;tle faith as expre&s;sly (2. <HI>Pet.</HI> iii, 15.) That <HI>the Long-&s;uffering of GOD is to be accounted Salvation:</HI> And with this <HI>Long-&s;uffering,</HI> a little before he couples, That <HI>he is not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h.</HI> Where, taking him for his own Interpreter, as is mo&s;t fit, he teaches, that tho&s;e to whom the LORD is <HI>long-&s;uffering</HI> (which he declareth he was to the Old World, and is now to All, <HI>not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h</HI>) they are to <HI>account this Long-&s;uffering of GOD to them Salvation.</HI> But how can they account it Salvation, if there be not &s;o much as a Po&s;&s;ibility of Sal|vation conveyed to them therein?</P>
<P N="24">24. St. <HI>Peter,</HI> further refers to the Writings of <HI>Paul,</HI> &s;hewing this to have been the Univer&s;al Doctrine. Where it is ob&s;ervable he adds, <HI>In which are &s;ome Things hard to be under&s;tood, which they that are unlearned and un&s;table wre&s;t to their own De&s;truction:</HI> Intimating plainly tho&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions in <HI>Paul</HI>'s Epi&s;tles, as <HI>Rom.</HI> ix. &amp;c. which &s;ome <HI>unlearned</HI> in Spiritual Things, <HI>wre&s;ted</HI> &s;o as to con|tradict <HI>GOD's Long &s;uffering towards All, not willing that any</HI> of them <HI>&s;hould peri&s;h, but that all &s;hould come to the</HI> &s;aving <HI>Knowledge of his Truth.</HI> Wou'd to GOD many had taken more Heed than they have to this Adver|ti&s;ement.</P>
<P N="25"><PB N="17" REF="005310_0017_1016FB5F01102BC8">25. That Place of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> which <HI>Peter</HI> &s;eems here more particularly to hint at, doth much contribute al&s;o to clear the Matter, <HI>Rom.</HI> ii. 4. <HI>De&s;pi&s;e&s;t thou the Riches of his Goodne&s;s and Forbearance and Long &s;uffering, not knowing that the Goodne&s;s of GOD leadeth thee to Repen|tance?</HI> St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;peaks here to the unregenerate and wicked, who (in the folowing Ver&s;e he &s;aith) <HI>trea&s;ure up Wrath unto the Day of Wrath.</HI> And to &s;uch he commends <HI>the Riches of the Forbearance and Long &s;uffering of GOD,</HI> &s;hewing that its tending is, To lead them to Repentance. But how cou'd it have this Tendency, To lead them to Repentance? Or how cou'd it be called <HI>Riches of Goodne&s;s</HI> to them, if there was not a Time wherein they might repent by it, and come to be Sharers of the <HI>Riches</HI> thereof?</P>
<P N="26">26. The Sum is this: If GOD plead with the Wicked, from the Po&s;&s;ibility of their being accepted; if GOD'S Spirit &s;trive with them for a Sea&s;on, in order to &s;ave them who afterwards peri&s;h; if he wait to be gracious unto them; if he be Long-&s;uffering towards them; if during the Time of this Long-&s;uffering GOD willeth them not to peri&s;h, but by the Riches of his Goodne&s;s and Forbearance leadeth them to Repentance; Then there was a Day of Vi&s;itation, even to tho&s;e who have peri&s;h'd, wherein they might have been &s;aved.</P>
<P N="27">27. Secondly, This appears from <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> v. 4. <HI>What could I have done more to my Vineyard?</HI> For in Ver&s;e 2, he &s;aith, <HI>He had &s;enced it and gather'd out the Stones thereof and planted with the choice&s;t Vine. And yet</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>when I looked it &s;hould have brought forth Grapes, it brought forth Wild Grapes.</HI> Wherefore he calleth the Men of <HI>Judah</HI> to judge between him and his Vineyard, &s;aying, <HI>What cou'd I have done more to my Vineyard than I have done in it? And yet</HI> (as is &s;aid) <HI>it brought forth Wild Grapes:</HI> Which was applied to tho&s;e in <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> who refu&s;ed GOD's Mercy. The &s;ame Similitude is u&s;ed by CHRIST, <HI>Matt.</HI> xxi. 33. <HI>Mark</HI> xii. 1. and <HI>Luke</HI> xx. 9. where JESUS &s;hews, how to &s;ome <HI>a Vineyard was planted,</HI> and all Things given nece&s;&s;ary for them, to get them Fruit
<PB N="18" REF="005310_0018_1016FB60D95630D8">
to render their Ma&s;ter, and how the Ma&s;ter many Times waited to be merciful to them, in &s;ending Servants after Servants, and pa&s;&s;ing by many Offences, before he deter|mined to de&s;troy and ca&s;t them out. Now this cannot be under&s;tood of the Saints, or of &s;uch as repent and are &s;aved: For its &s;aid expre&s;sly, <HI>He will de&s;troy them.</HI> Nei|ther would the Parable any way an&s;wer the End for which it is brought, if the&s;e Men had not been in a Capacity to have done good. Yea &s;uch was their Capacity that CHRIST &s;aith in the Prophet, what cou'd I have done more? So that it is manife&s;t, by this Parable, repeated by Three Evangeli&s;ts, CHRIST declares his Long-&s;uffering towards tho&s;e Men, who, when Means of Salvation were afforded to them, did neverthele&s;s re&s;i&s;t and wou'd not be &s;aved.</P>
<P N="28">28. La&s;tly, That there is a Day of Vi&s;itation given even to the Wicked, wherein they may be &s;aved, and which being expired they are then &s;hut out from Salva|tion, appears evidently by CHRIST'S Lamentation over <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> expre&s;t in three &s;undry Places, <HI>Matt.</HI> xxiii. 37, <HI>Luke</HI> xiii. 34, and 19, 41, 42. <HI>And when he was come near, he beheld the City and wept over it, &s;aying, If thou had&s;t known, even thou, at lea&s;t in this thy Day the Things that belong to thy Peace! But now they are hid from thine Eyes:</HI> Than which nothing can be more plain. For fir&s;t, he here &s;hews, That there was a Day, wherein the Inha|bitants of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> might <HI>have known tho&s;e Things that belonged to their Peace:</HI> Secondly, That during that Day, he was willing to have <HI>gather'd them, even as a Hen gathereth her Young:</HI> Thirdly, That becau&s;e they refu&s;ed <HI>the Things belonging to their Peace,</HI> they were at length <HI>hid from their Eyes.</HI> Why were they hid? Becau&s;e ye wou'd not &s;uffer me to <HI>gather You;</HI> ye wou'd not &s;ee tho&s;e Things that were <HI>good for you,</HI> in the Sea&s;on of GOD's Love towards you: And therefore <HI>now,</HI> that Day being expired, <HI>ye cannot &s;ee them.</HI> And for a farther Judgment, GOD &s;uffers you to be harden'd in Unbelief.</P>
<P N="29">29. So it is after they have rejected the Offer of
<PB N="19" REF="005310_0019_1016FB62644A0618">
Mercy, and Salvation, and not before, that GOD harden, Mens Hearts. And thus <HI>To him that hath &s;hall be given; and from him that hath not, &s;hall be taken away, even that which he hath: He hath not;</HI> becau&s;e he hath lo&s;t the Sea&s;on of u&s;ing it, and &s;o to him it is now as nothing. For CHRIST u&s;es this Expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>Matt.</HI> xxv. 26. on occa&s;ion of the taking <HI>the one Talent</HI> from the &s;lothful Servant: Which Talent was no way in&s;ufficient of it&s;elf, but of the &s;ame Nature with tho&s;e given to the others. And therefore the LORD had Rea&s;on to exact the Profit of it proportionably, as of the re&s;t. So (I &s;ay) it is after rejecting the Day of Vi&s;itation, that the Judgment of Obduration is inflicted on Men: As CHRIST pronounces it on the <HI>Jews,</HI> out of <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> vi. 9. which all the Four Evangeli&s;ts mention. <HI>Matt.</HI> xiii. 14. <HI>Mark</HI> iv. 12. <HI>Luke</HI> viii. 10. <HI>John</HI> xii. 40. And la&s;t of all, St. <HI>Paul,</HI> after he had offered Salvation to the <HI>Jews</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> pro|nounces the &s;ame, <HI>Acts</HI> xxviii. 26. <HI>Well &s;pake the Holy Gho&s;t by I&s;aiah the Prophet unto our Fathers, &s;aying, Go unto this People and &s;ay, Hearing ye &s;hall hear, and &s;hall not under&s;tand, and &s;eeing ye &s;hall &s;ee, and &s;hall not perceive. For the Heart of this People is waxed gro&s;s and their Ears are dull of hearing, and their Eyes have they clo&s;ed; lea&s;t they &s;hould &s;ee with their Eyes, and hear with their Ears, and under&s;tand with their Hearts, and &s;hould be converted and I &s;hould heal them.</HI> So it appears, that GOD wou'd have had them to &s;ee, but <HI>they clo&s;ed their Eyes;</HI> and therefore they were ju&s;tly harden'd.</P>
<P N="30">30. What now remains to be proved is, <HI>That GOD hath given to every Man during the Day of his Vi&s;itation, a Mea&s;ure of &s;aving &s;ufficient Light and Grace.</HI> And this I &s;hall prove, thro' GOD's A&s;&s;i&s;tance, by plain and clear Te&s;timonies of Scripture.</P>
<P N="31">31.

And for what End this Light is given, is expre&s;t in Ver&s;e 7. where <HI>John</HI> is &s;aid to come for <HI>a Witne&s;s to bear Witne&s;s to the Light, that all Men thro' it might believe.</HI> Our Tran&s;lators indeed (to make it &s;uit their own Doctrine) have turned the Words <HI>thro' Him,</HI> as if all Men were to believe thro' <HI>John.</HI> For which as there is nothing in the Text, &s;o it is contrary to the whole Strain of the Context. For &s;eeing CHRIST hath lighted every Man with this Light, is it not, that they may come to believe <HI>thro' it? John</HI> &s;hined not in Darkne&s;s, but this Light <HI>&s;hineth in the Darkne&s;s,</HI> that having di&s;pell'd the Darkne&s;s, it may beget Faith.</P>
<P N="34">34. Seeing then this Light is the Light of JESUS CHRIST, and the Light thro' which Men come to believe it needs not to be doubted, but that it is a &s;uper|natural, &s;aving and &s;ufficient Light. It cannot be any of the natural Faculties of our Soul, becau&s;e it is &s;aid to &s;hine in the Darkne&s;s, which Darkne&s;s is no other than
<PB N="21" REF="005310_0021_1016FB68138F33C0">
the natural State of Man. And that it is &s;ufficient and &s;aving, I prove thus:</P>
<P>That which is given that all Men thro' it may believe; that by walking in which we have Fellow&s;hip with GOD, mu&s;t be &s;ufficient to Salvation; but &s;uch is <HI>this Light.</HI> Therefore, it is &s;ufficient for Salvation.</P>
<P>Again, That which we are commanded to <HI>believe in, that we may become the Children of the Light,</HI> mu&s;t be a &s;upernatural, &s;ufficient and &s;aving Principle: But we are commanded &s;o to <HI>believe in this Light.</HI> Therefore, It is a &s;upernatural, &s;ufficient, and &s;aving Principle.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Propo&s;ition cannot be denied; the &s;econd is CHRIST'S own Words, <HI>John</HI> xii. 36. <HI>While ye have the Light, believe in the Light, that ye may be the Children of the Light.</HI></P>
<P N="35">35. If it be &s;aid, That by <HI>Light</HI> here is meant CHRIT'S outward Per&s;on, this is &s;ufficiently an&s;wered by the Words them&s;elves, and by the Ver&s;e going before, <HI>Walk, while ye have the Light, lea&s;t Darkne&s;s come upon you;</HI> plainly importing, That when that Light in which they were to believe was removed, they &s;hou'd lo&s;e the Capacity or Sea&s;on of believing. Now this cou'd not be under&s;tood of CHRIST'S Per&s;on; for many did &s;avingly believe in Him (as we do at this Day) when His outward Per&s;on was far removed from them. So that this Light in which they were commanded to believe mu&s;t be that inward Light from CHRIST, which &s;hines in every Man's Heart for a Sea&s;on, even during the Day of his Vi&s;itation: While this continueth to call, invite and exhort, Men are &s;aid to have it, and may believe in it. But when they have rejected it, it is at length withdrawn, and then they know not where to go. And therefore to &s;uch rebel|lious ones, the Day of the Lord is &s;aid to be <HI>Darkne&s;s</HI> and not <HI>Light, Amos</HI> v. 18.</P>
<P N="36">36. That <HI>a Mea&s;ure of this &s;aving Light or Grace is given to All,</HI> CHRIST telleth us expre&s;sly in the Parable of the Sower, <HI>Matt.</HI> xiii. <HI>Mark</HI> iv. and <HI>Luke</HI> viii. where He &s;aith, That this Seed &s;own in tho&s;e &s;everal Sorts of
<PB N="22" REF="005310_0022_1016FB6AE4A91220">
Ground, is <HI>The Word of the Kingdom,</HI> even <HI>that Word which,</HI> as St. <HI>James</HI> &s;aith, <HI>is able to &s;ave the Soul.</HI> Now we may ob&s;erve, That the Seed which was &s;own by the <HI>Way-&s;ide,</HI> and in the <HI>Stony</HI> and <HI>Thorny-Ground,</HI> altho' it did not profit there, was the &s;ame Seed which was &s;own in the <HI>good Ground.</HI> But the Cares of the World, or the Deceitfulne&s;s of Riches, or the De&s;ire of other Things, or the Fear of Per&s;ecution, hinders this Seed from growing in the Hearts of many. Not but that, in its own Nature, it is &s;ufficient to Salvation; being the very &s;ame with that, which groweth up and pro&s;pereth in the Hearts of tho&s;e who receive it. So that, tho' all are not &s;aved by it, yet there is a Seed of Salvation &s;own in the Hearts of All, which wou'd grow up and &s;ave the Soul, if it were not choaked and hindred.</P>
<P N="37">37. To this an&s;wers the Parable of the <HI>Talents, Matt.</HI> xxv. He that had two <HI>Talents</HI> was accepted as well as he that had <HI>five,</HI> becau&s;e he u&s;ed them to his Ma&s;ter's Profit. And he that had <HI>one</HI> might have done the &s;ame. His <HI>Talent</HI> was of the &s;ame Nature with the Re&s;t. It was as capable to have brought forth an Increa&s;e in Proportion as any of theirs. And &s;o, tho' there be not a like Proporti|on of Grace given to all, but to &s;ome <HI>five Talents,</HI> to &s;ome <HI>two,</HI> and to &s;ome <HI>one Talent</HI> only, yet there is given to All that which is &s;ufficient, and no more is required than according to that which is given: For <HI>unto whom&s;oever much is given, of him al&s;o much &s;hall be requir'd. Luke</HI> xii. 48. <HI>He that had the two Talents was accepted</HI> in giving <HI>four,</HI> nothing le&s;s than he that gave the <HI>ten.</HI> So &s;hou'd he al&s;o that gave the <HI>one,</HI> if he had given <HI>two.</HI> And no doubt <HI>one</HI> was as capable of producing <HI>two,</HI> as <HI>five</HI> of producing <HI>ten,</HI> or <HI>two four.</HI></P>
<P N="38">38. I &s;hall add but one Proof more, <HI>That all Men have a Mea&s;ure of &s;aving Grace,</HI> which is that of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Titus</HI> c. ii. 11. <HI>The Grace of GOD that bringeth Salvation hath appeared unto all Men:</HI> Than which there can be nothing more clear, it comprehending both Parts of the Controver&s;y. Fir&s;t, it te&s;tifies, that it is no natural
<PB N="23" REF="005310_0023_1016FB6CF73502C8">
Principle, but the <HI>Grace</HI> of GOD <HI>bringing Salvation.</HI> Secondly, It &s;ays, that this hath appeared, not to <HI>a Few,</HI> but <HI>to all Men.</HI> And there is nothing (as the following Words declare) required of Man, which this Grace teach|eth not. Yet I have heard a Publick Preacher, to evade the Strength of this Text, deny this Grace to be &s;aving and &s;ay, <HI>It meant only common Graces, &s;uch as is the Heat of the Fire and the Light of the Sun.</HI> Such is the Dark|ne&s;s of tho&s;e that oppo&s;e the Truth! Whereas the Text &s;aith expre&s;sly, it is &s;aving <HI>(Soterios.)</HI> Others that cannot deny but it is &s;aving, &s;ay, This <HI>all</HI> Means not every indi|vidual, but only &s;ome of all Kinds. But is a bare Denial &s;ufficient to overturn a po&s;itive A&s;&s;ertion? If the Scrip|tures may be &s;o abu&s;ed, what &s;o ab&s;urd as may not be pleaded for from them? Or what &s;o manife&s;t as may not be denied? We have then no Rea&s;on to be &s;tagger'd at their denying what the Scripture expre&s;sly affirms. They may as well per&s;uade us, that we do not intend that which we affirm, as make us believe the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks a Thing in plain Words, and yet intends quite the Contrary.</P>
<P N="39">39. And indeed can there be any Thing more ab&s;urd, than to &s;ay, where the Word is plainly ALL it does not mean ALL, but only FEW? It is true that ALL is &s;ometimes taken for the <HI>greater Number,</HI> of two Numbers mention'd; but let them &s;hew us if they can, either in Scripture, or Profane or Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Writings, that any Man who wrote Sen&s;e, did ever u&s;e the Word ALL, to expre&s;s of two Members, the Le&s;&s;er. Whereas they affirm, that the far Le&s;&s;er Number have receiv'd &s;aving Grace, and yet will have the Apo&s;tle to &s;ignify them only by the Word ALL: Contrary to all the Rules of &s;peaking, as well as to the whole Tenor of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P N="40">40. We conclude then, That <HI>the Go&s;pel is</HI> indeed <HI>Good Tidings of Great Joy which may be unto all People:</HI> That the Mini&s;ters thereof, <HI>are to preach to every Creature, to declare to all the common Salvation,</HI> and to offer <HI>Re|pentance and Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins, to all, warning every one
<PB N="24" REF="005310_0024_1016FB71378929C0">
and exhorting every one:</HI> That CHRIST <HI>died for All</HI> who died in <HI>Adam,</HI> that <HI>he gave him&s;elf a Ran&s;om for All; ta&s;ting Death for every Man:</HI> That <HI>he came not to condemn the World, but that the World thro' him might be &s;aved: That he willeth that all Men &s;hould be &s;aved, and willeth not that any &s;hou'd peri&s;h:</HI> That <HI>he is the Propitiation not for our Sins only, who believe, but al&s;o for the Sins of the whole World.</HI> That accordingly he giveth to all a Day or Time of Vi&s;itation, wherein it is po&s;&s;ible for them to be &s;aved; and therein a Mea&s;ure of &s;aving Grace, &s;o that if they die, their Blood is on their own Heads: Seeing, when they <HI>might</HI> they <HI>wou'd</HI> not come unto Him, that they might have Life.</P>
