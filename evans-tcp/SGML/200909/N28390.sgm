<L>When Phoebus was in his prime,</L>

<L>He loud began to cry.</L>
<L>Why, who art thou? &s;aid the old woman,</L>

<L>I am an out law, as many do know,</L>
<L>My name is Robin Hood.</L>

<L>How then the game would go,</L>

<L>We &s;hall find him I know.</L>
<L>The tinker had a crab-tree &s;taff,</L>

<L>Robin he had a good &s;trong blade,</L>

<L>The tinker he forgot,</L>
<L>What things he was about to do,</L>
<L>It fell &s;o to his lot.</L>
<L>That while the tinker fell a&s;leep,</L>
<L>He made then ha&s;te away,</L>
<L>And left the tinker in the lurch,</L>
<L>For a great &s;hot to pay.</L>
<L>But when the tinker awakened,</L>
<L>And found that he was gone,</L>
<L>And call'd then for his kind ho&s;t,</L>
<L>And thus he made his moan.</L>
<L>I had a warrant from the King,</L>
<L>That might have done me good,</L>
<L>That is to &s;eek a bold out-law,</L>
<L>Some call him Robin Hood.</L>
<L>But now my warrant and money's gone</L>
<L>Nothing I have to pay;</L>
<L>He that promi&s;ed to be my friend,</L>

<L>To day condemned to die.</L>
<L>Now Robin Hood is to Nottingham gone,</L>
<L>With a link a down, down and a day,</L>
<L>And there he met the proud Sheriff,</L>
<L><PB N="79" REF="037827_0078_100F817286C1E390">
Walking along the highway:</L>
<L>O &s;ave, O &s;ave, O Sheriff! he &s;aid,</L>
<L>What to day will you give unto me?</L>
<L>Some &s;uits and pence, the Sheriff replied,</L>
<L>To-day is a hangman's fee.</L>
<L>I was ne'er a hangman in my life,</L>
<L>Nor yet intends the trade,</L>
<L>But curs'd be he, &s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">old Robin,</L>
<L>That fir&s;t was a hangman made.</L>
<L>I have a horn in my pocket, &s;aid he,</L>
<L>I got from Robin Hood,</L>
<L>O wind thy horn, the Sheriff then &s;aid,</L>
<L>Let's hear if it blows good.</L>
<L>The fir&s;t loud bla&s;t that he did give,</L>
<L>He blew both loud and &s;hrill,</L>
<L>A hundred and fifty of Robin Hood's men</L>
<L>Came riding over the hill</L>
<L>They took the gallows from the &s;lack,</L>
<L>They &s;et it in the glen,</L>
<L>They hang'd the proud Sheriff on that,</L>
<L>And releas'd the three poor men.</L>

<HEAD>XXIII. Robin Hood and the valiant Knight.</HEAD>
<OPENER>TUNE&mdash;Robin Hood and the fifteen Fore&s;ters.</OPENER>
<L>WHEN Robin Hood and his merry men all</L>
<L>Had reigned many long years,</L>
<L>The King was then told they had been too bold</L>
<L>To his Bi&s;hops and noble peers.</L>
<L>Therefore he call'd a Council of &s;tate,</L>
<L>To know what was be&s;t to be done,</L>
<L>For to quell their pride or el&s;e it was fear'd</L>
<L>The land would be over-run</L>
<L>Having con&s;ulted a long &s;ummer's day,</L>
<L>At length it was agreed,</L>
<L><PB N="80" REF="037827_0079_100F81757199C4E8">
That one &s;hould be &s;ent to try the event,</L>
<L>And fetch him away with &s;peed.</L>
<L>Therefore, a tru&s;ty mo&s;t worthy Knight,</L>
<L>The King was pleas'd to call,</L>
<L>Sir William by name, when to him he came,</L>
<L>He told him his plea&s;ure and all.</L>
<L>Go then from hence to bold Robin Hood,</L>
<L>Bid him without more ado,</L>
<L>Surrender him&s;elf, or el&s;e the proud elf</L>
<L>Shall &s;uffer with all his bold crew.</L>
<L>He wander'd about till at length he came</L>
<L>To the tent of bold Robin Hood;</L>
<L>His bus'ne&s;s he &s;hews, bold Robin aro&s;e,</L>
<L>And there on his guard did &s;tand,</L>
<L>They'd have me &s;urrender, quoth Robin Hood,</L>
<L>And lie at their mercy then;</L>
<L>But tell them from me, that never &s;hall be,</L>
<L>While I have &s;even &s;core men</L>
<L>Then Robin &s;et his horn to his mouth,</L>
<L>And blew a bla&s;t or twain;</L>
<L>And &s;o did Knight, at which there in &s;ight,</L>
<L>The archers came all amain.</L>
<L>The archers on both &s;ides bent their bows,</L>
<L>And the clouds of arrows flew;</L>
<L>The very fir&s;t fight, that honor'd Knight</L>
<L>Did there bid the world adieu.</L>
<L>At length they went off, the party they went,</L>
<L>For London with right good will,</L>
<L>And Robin Hood he to the greenwood-tree,</L>
<L>And there he was taken ill.</L>
