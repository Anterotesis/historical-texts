<P>_I Am very &s;en&s;ible the greate&s;t part of what is offered in the following E&s;&s;ay, may be found in Treati&s;es already Publi&s;hed, and accordingly I have mentioned the Authors: and yet po&s;&s;ibly the Reader may find &s;ome things &s;ugge&s;ted, here and there, which he has not met with before. However it does not fall to every ones &s;hare to have the Books cited; and &s;ome of them are rarely to be &s;een in <HI>New-England:</HI> be&s;ides, the Col|lating many things thus together, will &s;ave both time and pains to &s;uch as have Libraries, and want Lei&s;ure to &s;earch them.</P>

<P>How near the&s;e great &amp; la&s;t Changes of the Church and World are, with the exact time &amp; order wherein they are to be Accompli&s;hed, are Matters too high for our Prophe|tical Chronologers: Whatever they may pretend to, the Arrows are beyond them: there is no fixing the certain Time for the Events of any Prophe&s;y before the Accompli&s;h|ment: (at the End it &s;hall Speak, <HI>Habak. ii. 3.</HI>)</P>

And becau&s;e we know not when the&s;e things, or the coming of the Son of Man &s;hall be, therefore the Churches, and all private Chri&s;tians are &s;olemnly charged (and it is at their utmo&s;t Peril, if they neglect it) to <HI>Watch &amp; Pray,</HI> Mark <HI>xiii. 13.</HI> &amp; ult. to be <HI>Sober &amp; Vigilant, 1</HI> Pet. <HI>v. 8.

<HEAD>An ESSAY to Explain that Pa&s;&s;age in the <HI>Revelations,</HI> Chap. XVIII. <HI>v.</HI> 13. &mdash; <HI>and Slaves and Souls of Men;</HI> with an Application thereof to the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_IT being a Matter of &s;uch mighty Con&s;e|quence to the People of GOD in the &s;everal Ages of the Church plainly to di&s;|cover <HI>Anti-chri&s;t,</HI> that &s;o <Q>they might not touch the unclean thing,</Q> but be &s;eparate; 'Tis not to be wonder'd at, that the HOLY GHOST in giving the Character of <HI>My&s;tical Babylon,</HI> the Mother of Harlots, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;hould de&s;cend to &s;uch Particulars as we meet with in this, and the preceding Chap|ter. For here we find the Apo&s;tate Church de&s;cribed from her Po&s;ture, <HI>Sitting,</HI> v. 3. I &s;aw a Woman <HI>Sit, &amp;c.</HI> thus old Babylond <HI>Sat</HI> as a Queen: Her Garb &amp; Attire, v. 4. &s;he was <HI>arrayed with Purple, and deckt with Gold, and pre|cious Stones,</HI> &amp;c. Notice is al&s;o taken of her Complexion, and Condition; She was <HI>Scarlet Coloured, and drunk with
<PB N="2" REF="003413_0008_100353B0AFA743B8">blood;</HI> the blood of Saints &amp; Martyrs, as it follows in the 6. v. And the better to find this &s;trange Woman, her Re&s;idence, or Place of Abode, is pointed out; <HI>the great City which Reigned over the Kings of the Earth,</HI> viz. <HI>ROME;</HI> which was famous for its &s;even Mountains, and therefore called <HI>Civitas Septicollis. Virgil</HI> &s;peaking of <HI>Rome</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Septem quae una &s;ibi muro circumdedit Arces:</HI> And the Ancient <HI>Romans</HI> had a Fea&s;t called <HI>Fe&s;tum Septimontium.</HI> And be|cau&s;e great Cities are very much known and di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Staple, or principal Wares they deal in; we have an Account of the <HI>Trade</HI> drove to, and from this <HI>My&s;tical Babylon,</HI> by her <HI>Merchants</HI> and Chapmen; and the very <HI>Commodities,</HI> as well tho&s;e Imported as Exported, are here Enumerated. The <HI>Invoice,</HI> which indeed is very particu|lar, begins at the 12th. ver&s;e, with <HI>Gold &amp; Silver,</HI> and ends in the 13th ver&s;e, with the <HI>Slaves and Souls of Men,</HI> as our <HI>Engli&s;h Bible</HI> reads it. The <HI>Margin</HI> indeed has it <HI>Bodies;</HI> The words in the <HI>Original,</HI> are <GAP DESC="foreign">; the true Meaning of which, I &s;hall now inquire into: And there being the lea&s;t difficulty with the word <HI>Souls,</HI> I &s;hall begin with that, tho' the other &s;tands fir&s;t in the Text.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be acknowledged, that in Scripture, as well as in other Writings, the word <HI>Soul,</HI> is often taken figuratively for the <HI>whole Per&s;on:</HI> yet on the other hand, the &s;acred Hi&s;torians, and other Writers u&s;e the word <GAP DESC="foreign">, and &s;carce any other, when they &s;peak of <HI>departed Spirits,</HI> or the Soul after it's Separation from the Body; as might be proved from innumerable In&s;tances, were there occa&s;ion. <HI>Homer</HI> the
<PB N="3" REF="003413_0009_100353B3EABC3368">Fountain of the <HI>Greek</HI> Language, for the mo&s;t part, if not always, u&s;es the word <GAP DESC="foreign">, for the <HI>Gho&s;ts</HI> or <HI>departed Spi|rits</HI> of the <HI>Graecian Heroes</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">.
<P>Engli&s;h;d by Mr. <HI>Pope:</HI></P>
<LG>
<L>That Wrath which hurl'd to <HI>Pluto</HI>'s gloomy Reign,</L>
<L>The SOULS of mighty Chiefs untimely Slain.</L>
</LG></NOTE> But I need not labour this; our Prote&s;tant Expo&s;itors being generally agreed, That by the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> in this place, we are to under&s;tand <HI>Souls departed.</HI></P>
<P>I proceed therefore to Explain the word <GAP DESC="foreign">. Our famous Mr. <HI>Brightman</HI> reads it <HI>Bodies:</HI> The <HI>French Bible</HI> renders the word <HI>E&s;claves: Junius</HI> and <HI>Tremellius</HI> tran&s;late it <HI>Mancipia;</HI> and &s;o do's the <HI>Vulgar Latin Bible,</HI> with many of the Criticks. It is probable, that which occa&s;ioned our Tran&s;lators, together with <HI>Ju|nius</HI> and <HI>Tremellius,</HI> and the <HI>Latin,</HI> and <HI>French Bibles,</HI> to render the word <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Slaves,</HI> or <HI>Mancipia,</HI> is a pa&s;&s;age in the De&s;cription which the Prophet <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> Chap. xxvii. gives of the rich Trade and Supply of <HI>Tyre,</HI> ver&s;e 13. <HI>Ja|van, Tubal, and Me&s;hec, they were thy Merchants; they traded the Per&s;ons of Men,</HI> as <HI>our Bible</HI> reads it, and &s;o does the <HI>French.</HI> The <HI>Latin</HI> has it <HI>Mancipia;</HI> Junius and Tremellius, <HI>Hominibus:</HI> But the general Opinion of Ex|po&s;itors, is that the Prophet <HI>Ezekiel</HI> intends <HI>Servants,</HI> or <HI>Slaves</HI> that were &s;old at <HI>Tyre:</HI> And without doubt the Allegorical de&s;cription of <HI>My&s;tical Babylon</HI> in this Chapter, is taken from that Prophecy in <HI>Ezekiel.</HI> But then as Mr.
<PB N="4" REF="003413_0010_100353B9A90DFE98"><HI>Brightman</HI> upon the Place ob&s;erves, the&s;e words in the <HI>Revelations</HI> have a far other Meaning than tho&s;e in <HI>Ezekiel:</HI> and upon the la&s;t words in the ver&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> and <HI>Souls</HI> of Men &s;ays, <Q>THE HOLY GHOST &s;eems to have changed the Con&s;truction of the words of &s;et purpo&s;e, that He might note out the Difference between this Commodity, and all the other, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the <HI>Bodies;</HI> for the&s;e words <HI>and Souls,</HI> are not put in the Genitive Ca&s;e, as it is clear in the <HI>Greek</HI> text, but in the Accu&s;ative, as we have tran&s;|lated it in the <HI>Latin;</HI> whereby it is &s;ignified that there is a diver&s;e, and di&s;tinct Con&s;ideration made in the Place, of <HI>Souls</HI> and <HI>Bodies.</HI></Q> Thus that Learned Man.</P>
<P>This remarkable Di&s;tinction makes it the more &s;trange, that &s;uch of our Prote&s;tant Expo&s;itors, as under&s;tand by the word <GAP DESC="foreign">. <HI>Spirits</HI> or <HI>&s;eparate Souls,</HI> &s;hould render the preceding word <GAP DESC="foreign"><HI>Slaves:</HI> For Slavery is <HI>Conditio Per&s;onae,</HI> and takes in the <HI>whole Man,</HI> to wit, Soul and Body, <HI>Conjunctim;</HI> whereas in the text they are plainly Enumerated as <HI>two di&s;tinct Species</HI> of Merchandize.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, I doubt upon Examination, even the Prote&s;tants will be found as much concerned in the Merchandize of Slaves, as tho&s;e of the Romi&s;h Religion, and &s;o it can't be a Characteri&s;tic of the Apo&s;tate Church, which (as has been noted) is the great De&s;ign of the Context.</P>
<P>I have already ob&s;erved, That Mr. <HI>Brightman</HI> reads the word <GAP DESC="foreign">, in this place, <HI>Bodies:</HI> but then he applies it to the <HI>Switzers,</HI> who are a <HI>Corpulent</HI> People, and furni&s;h the Pope with his &s;tanding Guards.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="003413_0011_100353C3CCFFFCD8">
Some Learned Men have thought, that the wretched Sub|jection and Va&s;&s;alage of the Princes and People in <HI>Europe,</HI> to the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> e&s;pecially in the Ages preceding the Reformation, when the Popes treated them like <HI>Slaves,</HI> is here intended.</P>
<P>Others again are of Opinion, That by the word <GAP DESC="foreign">, we may very well under&s;tand, the Merchandize made by the Romi&s;h Church of the Bodies of Men <HI>while alive,</HI> in tho&s;e Rigorous and unnatural Cha&s;ti&s;ings of the Body, by Shirts of Mail, Haircloth, Whippings, and other Bodily Penances: which, tho' enjoyned &amp; practi&s;ed under pretence of &s;piritual Mortification, and for the good of the Soul; yet upon oc|ca&s;ion may be di&s;pen&s;ed with, and are commuted into Money, or &s;ome other Emolument to the Church, and &s;o turned into <HI>Merchandize.</HI> But <HI>Veritas rei,</HI> &amp; <HI>veritas loci,</HI> are two different things. The Que&s;tion is not what the word <GAP DESC="foreign">, in general &s;ignifies, or how it may be rendred in other Places; but what the Meaning of it is in this Invoice of the Merchandize of My&s;tical Babylon.</P>
<P>And with Reverence to our Engli&s;h Tran&s;lators, and the other Venerable Authors before-mentioned, I am of Opinion, That by the word <GAP DESC="foreign">, in the Text, we ought to under&s;tand the DEAD BODIES of Men: To &s;upport which, be&s;ides what has been already mentioned tending that way, I would offer the following Con&s;iderations.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It is well known, That the Romi&s;h Church for &s;everal Ages, has made Merchandize as well of the
<PB N="6" REF="003413_0012_100353C6EE82FB80"><HI>Dead Bodies,</HI> as the <HI>&s;eparate Souls</HI> of Men: (as is proved in the following E&s;&s;ay.) Now if we are to &s;uppo&s;e the HOLY GHOST in this Place, (as our Prote&s;tant Expo|&s;itors grant) De&s;igns by the word <GAP DESC="foreign">, the Merchandize which the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> makes of <HI>&s;eparate Souls;</HI> cer|tainly it is as rea&s;onable to think, That by the word <GAP DESC="foreign">, He &s;hould point out another Branch of their vile Trade, <HI>viz.</HI> that of the <HI>Dead Bodies</HI> of Men.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Secondly,</HI> The manife&s;t Di&s;tinction in the Original, and &s;o between the <HI>two Species</HI> of Merchandize ob&s;erved by Mr. <HI>Brightman,</HI> will be mo&s;t effectually pre&s;erved by this Interpretation of the word <GAP DESC="foreign">: for the <HI>Soul</HI> and <HI>Body</HI> are never &s;o much Contradi&s;tingui&s;hed, as after they are <HI>&s;eparated.</HI> And therefore Death is defined to be <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Separatio Animae et Corporis.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> And to mention no more, the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> is &s;o render'd, not only by the <HI>Greek</HI> Authors and Lexicons, but al&s;o by the <HI>Tran&s;lators</HI> of the Bible in many other Places. 'Tis likewi&s;e very ob&s;ervable, That the only words us'd in the <HI>Septuagint</HI> and <HI>New Te&s;tament,</HI> for <HI>Servants and Bondmen,</HI> are <GAP DESC="foreign"> and <GAP DESC="foreign">: And among the <HI>Ancient Grecians</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign"> was the Name of a <HI>Slave,</HI> or the wor&s;t &s;ort of Servants. <HI>Scapula,</HI> after he has render'd <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>Corpus,</HI> e&s;pecially <HI>Corpus hominis,</HI> takes notice that <HI>Plutarch,</HI> when &s;peaking of burning the <HI>Dead Bodies,</HI> expre&s;&s;es it in the <HI>Greek,</HI> by <GAP DESC="foreign"> And in another Place de&s;crib|ing the manner of Crucifying among the <HI>Romans,</HI> &s;ays,
<PB N="7" REF="003413_0013_100353CDCE87C9A0"><GAP DESC="foreign"> And <HI>Homer</HI> before-mentioned, u&s;es the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> for the <HI>dead Body</HI> in the xxiv. of his <HI>Ody&s;&s;es.</HI> One of the Grecian Heroes in <HI>Hades</HI> is repre&s;ented as bewailing, That in &s;uch a Battle he, and others were &s;lain, but their <HI>Bodies</HI> lay neglected; <HI>Corpora neglecta jacent;</HI> in the <HI>Greek</HI> it is <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>&amp;c.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Schrevelius</HI> renders <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Corpora, Servi.</HI> Hedericus <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>Corpus, Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">, Mancipium.

<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> the <HI>Offerings</HI> made to the Shrine, and in Honour of the <GAP DESC="foreign"> of the Place were very Valuable. <HI>The Author but now named,</HI> in the &s;ame Book, acquaints us, That the Annual Oblations at <HI>Beckets</HI> Tomb amounted to near a <HI>thou&s;and Pounds</HI> Sterling; and that King <HI>Lewis</HI> the &s;e|venth of <HI>France</HI> came over in Pilgrimage to it, and offered a Stone reckoned to be the riche&s;t in <HI>Europe:</HI> So that this Shrine grew to be of ine&s;timable value; for when it came to be broken by <HI>Henry</HI> the VIII. the Gold of it was &s;o heavy that it filled two Che&s;ts, which took eight Men a piece to carry them out of the Church.</P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> CANONIZATION. The Canonizing of Saints is defined by <HI>Bellarmine,</HI> as he is quoted by Mr. <HI>Willet,</HI> to be <Q>The public determination and &s;entence of the Church, whereby <HI>Men that are Dead</HI> are judged to be <HI>Saints,</HI> and worthy of Honour and Wor&s;hip; as to

This bla&s;phemous Power, notwith|&s;tanding what <HI>Bellarmine</HI> pretends, was &s;o abu&s;ed at length, that &s;ome of the Vile&s;t of Men were &s;et up for Saints, and Wor&s;hipped accordingly. Even <HI>Thomas Becket</HI> before-named, was Canonized by <HI>Pope Alexander,</HI> under a pretence that &s;ome Miracles were wrought by him; and the Name of the Cathedral Church at <HI>Canterbury,</HI> was alter'd from <HI>Chri&s;t's Church</HI> to St. <HI>Thomas Becket</HI>'s: And yet at the &s;ame time, the <HI>Sorboni&s;ts</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">A Univer&s;ity of Divines at <HI>Paris.</HI></NOTE> maintained in their Public Di&s;putes, <HI>He was ju&s;tly Condemned for Rebellion:</HI> and therefore his Shrine was put down in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and his Bones burnt by order of the Lord <HI>Cromwell. Agrippa</HI> before-named &s;ays, <Q>There are many that held heretical Opinions who were counted in the Canon of Saints.</Q> <HI>Bonnaventure,</HI> who was guilty of Bla&s;phemy

<P>Nor is this Trade of making of Saints yet given over: No Century pa&s;&s;es, but &s;everal new Saints are added to the Popi&s;h Calender. And it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the <HI>Roman</HI> Pontiff will make &s;o valuable a Pre&s;ent as that of a new Saint, to any of the Churches or Religious Orders for nothing: This like the ancient Freedom among the <HI>Romans,</HI> mu&s;t be purcha&s;ed with a great Sum. At the &s;ame time, the Popes Brokers don't &s;tick at the Price; &s;ince they are &s;ure of making their Money again of the Shrine, with great Advantage; for as Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI> in his Treati&s;e of <HI>the Idolatry of the Church of Rome</HI> ob&s;erves, <Q>a new Saint at fir&s;t, and &s;o for a con&s;iderable time, gets the better of all the re&s;t.</Q> D.

<P N="2">2. <HI>Secondly.</HI> A &s;econd Branch of the Merchandize made by the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> of the <HI>Souls</HI> of Men, is the making and paying of VOWS to <HI>Saints,</HI> or &s;uch as are Canoniz'd by the Pope.</P>
<P>Having hinted at &s;omething of this Super&s;tition already under the head of Relicks and Pilgrimages, I &s;hall &s;ay the le&s;s here; not but that it very well de&s;erves to be In&s;i&s;ted on, and Expo&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="003413_0029_1003541D76612C50">
This piece of Idolatry is a Branch of that Adoration, which the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> &s;ay is due to Saints in the&s;e words, <Q>VOWS may be made to <HI>Saints</HI> properly as unto GOD, tho' not altogether in the &s;ame manner.</Q> And they are encouraged to that Degree, that contrary to all Laws Divine and Humane; Husbands are deprived of the Power of hindering their Wives from making them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Matter</HI> of the&s;e <HI>Vows</HI> is Various according to the Humour or Condition of the Per&s;ons that make them. One will Vow to go a Pilgrimage to &s;ome Saint, or Holy Place: Another to enter into &s;uch a Religious Society, or do &s;uch a piece of Service, for the Honour of the Church: Others again, to Offer a Sum of Money, or &s;uch a particular Pre&s;ent to this or that Saint, Image, Society, or Pious u&s;e.</P>
<P>And as the Making the&s;e Vows, is very much recom|mended by the Doctors of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church; &s;o the Per|formance of them as rigidly In&s;i&s;ted on by the Confe&s;&s;ors, who to that end, diligently enquire, among other things, of the Per&s;ons that come to be Confe&s;&s;ed, What <HI>Vows</HI> they are under, and how they have been complied with; and tho&s;e of them that are not Originally for Money, may be changed into a <HI>pecuniary Mulct,</HI> and &s;o made Merchandize.</P>

3. <HI>Thirdly.</HI> I proceed therefore to the third and la&s;t Branch of the Merchandize made of <HI>Souls</HI> departed by the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> which I propo&s;ed to &s;peak to, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Redeeming Souls</HI> out of PURGATORY by the help of MASSES, Prayers and Indulgencies.</P>
<P>This is generally reckoned to be the deepe&s;t Corruption, and the mo&s;t profitable Invention that ever that Church was guilty of; and &s;o peculiar to <HI>Rome Papal,</HI> That Mr. <HI>Willet</HI> ob&s;erves, No other Church in Chri&s;tendom, even the mo&s;t Erronious has ever taken it up; And the Pro|phet's Charge again&s;t Idolatrous <HI>I&s;rael</HI> may be here fitly apply'd, <HI>They have &s;eparated them&s;elves to that Shame</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ho&s;. ix. 10.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The <HI>Popes</HI> PURGATORY, for &s;o it may properly be called, is Defined by the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church, to be <Q>a certain Infernal Place in the Earth called <HI>Purgatory,</HI> in the which, as in a Pri&s;on hou&s;e, tho&s;e who were not fully purged in this Life, are fully clean&s;ed and purg'd by fire, before they can be received into Heaven.</Q></P>
<P>It is not to be wondred at, that this Mon&s;tre &s;tuck &s;o long in the Birth: for tho' it was in a &s;ort Conceived by the <HI>Monks</HI> between the <HI>Fourth</HI> and <HI>Sixth Centuries,</HI> and in the following Ages, formed and fa&s;hioned by the <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> and <HI>Popes</HI> of <HI>Rome;</HI> yet it was not perfectly Delivered till the Year 1439; and then this Damnable Doctrine was made an Article of Faith by the Council of <HI>Florence,</HI> and He was Cur&s;ed to Hell, that did not believe it.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="003413_0031_10035428AB83F038">
In the <HI>next Century</HI> the Council of <HI>Trent</HI> E&s;tabli&s;hed it yet further. The Words of the 19th Article of the <HI>Trent</HI> Creed, <Q>I do Stedfa&s;tly Believe that there is a <HI>Pur|gatory,</HI> and that the Souls therein detained are help'd by the Prayers of the Faithful.</Q></P>
<P>The third Canon of the Council of <HI>Trent,</HI> Anathema|tizes all tho&s;e who &s;ay, the Sacrifice of the <HI>Ma&s;s</HI> profits only him that takes it, and that it ought not to be offered for the Satisfaction of the Sins of the living &amp; the dead. <HI>Bellarmine</HI> indeed tells us, That this Doctrine mu&s;t be under&s;tood only of <HI>Venial</HI> Sins, and not &s;uch as are <HI>Mortal,</HI> for the latter he grants &s;end Men to Hell directly.</P>
<P>One great Point yet remain'd; and that was to make this wonderful Power of delivering Souls out of Purgatory, a <HI>Prerogative</HI> or Peculiar to the See of <HI>Rome,</HI> and fix it in the <HI>Pope,</HI> that &s;o the Profits might all centre with <HI>Him.</HI> Thereupon the Canoni&s;ts and great Doctors of that Church declare, <Q>That Bi&s;hops and other In&s;eriour Prie&s;ts cannot apply Indulgences to the Dead; it belongs only to the <HI>Pope.</HI></Q> Among others <HI>Johannes Angelus</HI> affirms, "The Souls in Purgatory are under the Popes Juri&s;diction"; and Father <HI>Alexander,</HI> in his 5th Tome, Title <HI>Indulgences,</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Non Vivis Solum &s;ed etiam defunctis pro&s;unt Indul|gentioe e</HI> SUMMO PONTIFICE, <HI>pro illorum leva|mine conce&s;&s;oe illi&s;que &s;peciatim applicatoe.</HI></P>

Thus the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church at length E&s;tabli&s;hed the Doctrine of <HI>Purgatory</HI> in all the &s;everal Articles of it. Having done this; The next thing was to &s;et up a <HI>Trade</HI> upon this Foundation, and to make Merchandize of it, for that was the Main thing de&s;igned all along. Here-upon the Bi&s;hops, Prie&s;ts and Religious of all Orders, were &s;et to work, to draw in the Super&s;titious People to <HI>Purcha&s;e</HI> the&s;e Ma&s;&s;es, Prayers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> at &s;uch Rates, as they were plea&s;ed to &s;et upon them, in order to redeem the Souls of their Ance&s;tors, Children, and other Friends, out of Purgatory. This work was &s;oon accompli&s;hed, and the great Point quickly gained, thro' the Craft and Delu&s;ion of the Popes Agents: for <HI>the World</HI> in tho&s;e Ages, as 'twas Prophecied, <HI>Wondered after the Bea&s;t,</HI> and being given up, <HI>Sacro-&s;ancta Dei Ira,</HI> to &s;trong Delu&s;ions, they believed Lies. The Merchants and Chapmen of <HI>Rome,</HI> like <HI>Locu&s;ts</HI> Swarmed all over the Chri&s;tian World, and with the greate&s;t Impu|dence, tho' under the Cloak of Piety and Compa&s;&s;ion to Souls, bartered away the&s;e Commodities, for that which was much better, Money, Lands, or any thing el&s;e of value they could get.</P>
<P>This wretched Trade was carried on with &s;o much Fraud and Wickedne&s;s, for &s;o many Ages, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible, as Bi&s;hop <HI>Burnet</HI> ob&s;erves, to read the Account of it, without both Amazement &amp; Indignation. And yet out of this very Eater at length there came forth Meat; for the Infamous <HI>Sale of Indulgences</HI> from <HI>Pope Leo</HI> the X in <HI>Saxony,</HI> was

<P>The fir&s;t thing the&s;e Spiritual Factors laid their hands on for Returns to <HI>Rome,</HI> was the <HI>Money and Moveable Trea|&s;ure</HI> of the Nation; but they could not &s;top here, they had their Eye upon the <HI>Solid E&s;tate</HI> of the Kingdom, in order to make a <HI>Land Bank</HI> of the&s;e new Bills: This al&s;o (to the &s;hame of our Ance&s;tors be it &s;poken) was &s;oon effected, and a great part of the <HI>Terre</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> be|&s;towed upon Religious Hou&s;es, or for &s;ome Pious u&s;e, as it was called, upon no other <HI>Con&s;ideration,</HI> than a certain Number of the&s;e Indulgences for the Redemption of Souls out of Purgatory.

If it be a great Impiety, as one ob&s;erves, to abu&s;e Dead Bodies, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e that Believe and look for their Re&s;urrection; how Aggravated mu&s;t this Iniquity be, when they are thus made the <HI>In&s;tru|ments of Idolatry?</HI> An high Affront of the Divine Maje&s;ty, much of the &s;ame nature with what we find Idolatrous <HI>I&s;rael</HI> charged in the days of <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> Chap. xliii. 7, 8. <HI>Son of Man, the Place of my Throne, and even my Holy Name have they Defiled, with the Carca&s;&s;es of their Kings in their high Places.</HI></P>
<P>This great Abomination of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church has been matter of <HI>Scandal</HI> to the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Name and Religion, even among <HI>Infidels.</HI> A notable proof of this may be found in the 1&s;t <HI>Vol.</HI> of the <HI>curious Letters</HI> before-mentio|ned, <HI>pag.</HI> 40. Father <HI>A. Arnedo,</HI> a Spani&s;h Je&s;uit, in his Letter from <HI>Sinoa,</HI> dated <HI>July</HI> 1700, in the Account he gives of a Per&s;ecution rai&s;ed upon the Chri&s;tians in <HI>Cochin-china,</HI> takes particular notice of the Treatment the King of that Country gave their <HI>Relicks</HI> (of which &s;ome were entire Bones:) The King taking the&s;e into his hands and &s;hewing them to tho&s;e of his Country. <Q>Behold

<P>And if we &s;urvey the Merchandizing of <HI>Souls,</HI> what a Ma&s;s and Complication of Wickedne&s;s do we find in it? Let it &s;uffice here only to take notice of the <HI>Fraud</HI> and <HI>Inju&s;tice</HI> that runs thro' the whole. Hence it is that in the Prophecy of the Apo&s;tate Church, among other Crimes found at the Door of My&s;tical <HI>Babylon;</HI> we read of her <HI>The&s;ts,</HI> Rev. ix. 21. <GAP DESC="foreign"> in the Plural Number, to &s;ignify not only the Multitude of them, but the many and various ways the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church has of defrauding and cheating the Nations. This particular Charge of the HOLY GHOST, was doubtle&s;s de&s;igned to point out not only the open Violence &amp; Robbery of the Bi&s;hops and Popes of <HI>Rome,</HI> in the Plunders and Depredations they have made on their Neighbours, both Princes and People, of their <HI>Civil</HI> Rights and Properties; but likewi&s;e their <HI>Spiritual and Religious</HI> The&s;ts, if I may &s;o call 'em; &s;uch as their <HI>Sacrilege</HI> and <HI>Simony,</HI> the Infamous Sale of their <HI>Pardons</HI> and <HI>Indulgences,</HI> and in an a&s;pecial manner this Merchan|dizing the Bodies and Souls of Men: Every Penny rai&s;ed

<P N="3">3. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> How clear and evident does this Merchan|dizing the Bodies and Souls of Men, among other Proofs, make it, that the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church, with the Pope at the Head of it, is <HI>That Man of Sin, that wicked one, that was to be revealed,</HI> of whom the Apo&s;tle in his Frophecy of the great Apo&s;tacy of the Chri&s;tian Church gives &s;o large and particular an Account in his ad. <HI>Epi&s;t.</HI> to the <HI>The&s;.</HI> ii. <HI>Chap.</HI> &mdash; Our Prote&s;tant Divines are generally agreed, that by the <HI>Man of Sin</HI> here &s;poken of, we are not to under&s;tand. as the Papi&s;ts would have us believe, a <HI>&s;ingle Per&s;on,</HI> but a <HI>Compages of many,</HI> or a Sy&s;tem of Men either Exi&s;ting to|gether, or Succeeding one another. Now among other Signs or <HI>Indicia</HI> of this Man of Sin or Antichri&s;t, here &s;et down by the <HI>Apo&s;tle,</HI> we are told, That <HI>his coming &s;hould be with all Deceivablene&s;s of Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Omni Fraude Inju&s;titiae,</HI> as one of the Criticks has it; <HI>Fraude omnis Generis,</HI> all kind of Deceit, as another. <HI>Iniquitas &s;ed My&s;tica,</HI> i.e. <HI>Pietatis nomine Palliata;</HI> &s;o the ordinary Glo&s;s expoundeth the Place; an <HI>Iniquity</HI> indeed, but <HI>My&s;tical</HI> cloaked with the name of <HI>Piety.

How exactly does the Practice of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church expo&s;ed in the E&s;&s;ay, an&s;wer this Prophecy of the Apo&s;tle?

<P N="1">1 <HI>Corollary.</HI> Hereupon we &s;hould never &s;peak or think. of <HI>Popery</HI> without an holy Indignation and Abhorrence If he that touched a Dead Body, by the <HI>Levitical Law</HI> became unclean Seven days; how putid and loath&s;ome mu&s;t <HI>My&s;tical Babylon</HI> be at this day, who for &s;o many Ages has been defiling her&s;elf (in a much wor&s;e &s;en&s;e) with the dead Bodies and Bones of Men?

<P>The early Degeneracy and after <HI>Apo&s;tacy</HI> of the Chri&s;tian Church, has been all along matter of Wonder, and is not ea&s;ily accounted for. The Primitive Fathers in the Writ|ings they have left us, complain of Pride, Covetou&s;ne&s;s and Ambition, e&s;pecially in the Bi&s;hops and Pa&s;tors, as the great Cau&s;e of it: But by the be&s;t Judgment I can make from the nature of the thing it &s;elf, and the Hi&s;tory of tho&s;e times, no one thing proved of &s;uch fatal Con&s;equence to the pure Faith and Wor&s;hip of the Primitive Chri&s;tians, as their &s;werving or declining from the SCRIPTURES, and not <HI>continuing &s;tedfa&s;tly in the Apo&s;tles Doctrine.</HI> Had the Churches been mindful of the Words &s;poken to them by the Holy Prophets, and of the Commandment of the Apo&s;tles, and touched every new Doctrine and Ritual, by the <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>the Te&s;timony;</HI> they had not been &s;o ea&s;ily impo&s;ed on by tho&s;e fal&s;e Teachers (that aro&s;e quickly after the Death of the Apo&s;tles) Men that Cor|rupted the Word of GOD with their own Inventions and bold Additions: and great &s;tre&s;s was laid on <HI>Traditions,</HI> pretended to be from the Apo&s;tles; &s;o that at length the Church for&s;ook the Guide of her Youth, and then no wonder her Hou&s;e inclined to Death, and her Paths to the dead. A multitude of Errors and Super&s;titions, one after another, (and among the re&s;t, the Popi&s;h Relicks and

<P>The&s;e things were fir&s;t introduced and managed more <HI>Covertly,</HI> by Men of Subtilty and De&s;ign, that walked in Craftine&s;s and handled the Word of GOD deceitfully: But afterwards the Bi&s;hops of <HI>Rome</HI> carried the work on more <HI>openly,</HI> and with the utmo&s;t Impudence, a&s;&s;uming to them&s;elves and their Councils, the &s;ole Power of Judging what, or which was Scripture, and accordingly took upon them to alter and to amend the Scriptures; and deter|mined that the Scriptures were not &s;ufficient without Tradition, and that Apo&s;tolical Traditions were of equal Authority with the Writings of the Apo&s;tles: And yet all this would not &s;erve the turn, &s;o long as the Fountain was kept open, and Chri&s;tians could have recour&s;e to the BIBLE, and thereby di&s;cern the vile Abu&s;es put upon them. And therefore in order to compleat the Ruin of the Primitive Faith and Wor&s;hip, the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church at length took away the Key of Knowledge, and forbid the Common People the Reading of the Scriptures, upon this fal&s;e Principle (among others) that Ignorance is the Mother of Devotion<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Council of <HI>Tholou&s;e,</HI> Anno 1 2 2 9.

This great Iniquity of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> has been matter of Offence to &s;ome, even of their own Communion, Particularly the famous Father <HI>Que&s;nel,</HI> who in his ad|mirable <HI>The&s;es,</HI> publi&s;hed about <HI>twenty Years</HI> &s;ince, with great Earne&s;tne&s;s, declares again&s;t forbidding Chri&s;tians the Reading of the Holy Scriptures, e&s;pecially the Go&s;pel, or keeping it clo&s;e and bound up in an unknown Tongue, as a mo&s;t heinous Sin.

<HEAD>AN ARGUMENT To Prove That MANY OTHERS, be&s;ides CALEB &amp; JOSHUA Might enter into <HI>Canaan</HI> Who were Twenty Years old at the Coming out of <HI>Egypt.</HI> OR, An EXERCITATION On <HI>Numbers</HI> XIV from the 21 to the 30 V. and the Reference thereto, in <HI>Chap.</HI> XXXII. 10, 11, 12. which runs thus; <HI>And the LORD</HI>'s <HI>Anger was kind|led the &s;ame time, and he Sware, &s;aying, Surely none of the Men that came up out of</HI> Aegypt, <HI>from Twenty Years old &amp; upwards &s;hall &s;ee the Land which I Sware to</HI> Abraham, <HI>to</HI> I&s;aac, <HI>and to</HI> Jacob, <HI>Becau&s;e they have not wholly followed Me; &s;ave</HI> CALEB, <HI>the Son of</HI> Jephunneh <HI>the Kenezite, and</HI> JOSHUA, <HI>the Son of</HI> Nun, <HI>for they have wholly followed the LORD.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE common Opinion from the&s;e two Pa&s;&s;ages, and &s;ome other Places to the &s;ame purpo&s;e is, That not a Single Man of the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> that came out of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> at <HI>Twenty Years</HI> of Age, (&s;ave JOSHUA and CALEB) were permitted to enter into <HI>Canaan.</HI> This Opinion has prevailed &s;o much and &s;o long, that even &s;ome Learned Men have received it, particularly the <HI>Author</HI> of
<PB N="46" REF="003413_0052_10036A45758E3480">the <HI>Chronological Connection,</HI> in Mon&s;ieur <HI>Saurin's</HI> Di&s;&s;erta|tions, on the <HI>Pentateuch,</HI> Vol. I. p. 358. and Dr. <HI>W.

But of this, I &s;hall take Notice in the Conclu&s;ion of the Exercitation.</P>
<P>In order to Correct the general Opinion above-mentioned, and to &s;et that matter in a full &amp; clear light, there needs no more than a careful Comparing the following Places, <HI>viz. Numbers</HI> the I, Chap. from the 44 to the 49 V; and <HI>Num|bers</HI> the XIV Chap. V. 29. and &s;o on; <HI>Numbers</HI> XXVI Chap. V. 3, 51, 62, and &s;o on; II. Chap. of <HI>Deuterenomy,</HI> 14, 15, 16. V; <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> V. 4 &amp; 6 ver&s;es; By which it will appear,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That in the <HI>two</HI> famous <HI>Mu&s;ters</HI> of the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> from twenty Years Old and upwards, the <HI>Levites</HI> or the <HI>Tribe of Levi,</HI> were not numbred.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>fir&s;t Mu&s;ter</HI> Recorded, <HI>Numbers</HI> Chap. I, They only, were to be numbred, that were able to go forth to <HI>War:</HI> Now the <HI>Levites</HI> were never reckoned as Part of the <HI>Militia;</HI> and ver&s;e 47, It is expre&s;ly &s;aid, the <HI>Levites</HI> were not numbred among them; and the &s;pecial Rea&s;on is given in the following ver&s;es. This fir&s;t Mu&s;ter was made at Mount <HI>Sinai</HI> by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> in the Second Year after their coming out of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and referr'd to in <HI>Exodus</HI> XXXVIII Chap. ver&s;e 26. And in the <HI>&s;econd</HI> Mu&s;ter,
<PB N="47" REF="003413_0053_10036A4B30351080">which was made by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Eleazer,</HI> in the Plains of <HI>Moab, Thirty-eight</HI> Years afterwards, we find the &s;ame Li|mitation and Exception, <HI>Numbers</HI> XXVI. 2. and in the 62 ver&s;e. <HI>For they</HI> (i. e. the Levites) <HI>were not num|bred among the Children of I&s;rael, becau&s;e there was no Inheritance given them among the Children of I&s;rael:</HI> For they only were to be numbred of the Congregation of the Children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> to whom the Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> was to be divided for an Inheritance, as in <HI>ver&s;e</HI> 53.</P>
<P>It is very plain from the Places before cited, That as in the terrible <HI>Commination</HI> of Dying in the Wilderne&s;s, and being Excluded from <HI>Canaan,</HI> recorded in the XIV Chap; &s;o in the awful <HI>Execution</HI> of that Sentence recorded in the XXVI Chapter, the two la&s;t ver&s;es, the <HI>Levites</HI> were not included.</P>
<P>To begin with the Sentence in the XIV Chapter; more e&s;pecially tho&s;e words in the 29th ver&s;e, <HI>Your Carca&s;&s;es &s;hall fall in this Wilderne&s;s, and all that were numbred of you according to your whole number from twenty Years old and upward, which have Murmured again&s;t Me, &s;hall not come into the Land,</HI> &amp;c. Can any thing be plainer, than that the Per&s;ons Convict and Condemned were only tho&s;e that were numbred from twenty Years old and upwards, (<HI>viz.</HI> by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron;</HI>) and was there One <HI>Levite</HI> among&s;t them?</P>
<P>And the matter is full as clear after the Sentence was executed, <HI>Chapter</HI> XXVI, and the two la&s;t ver&s;es: But among the&s;e there was not a Man of them whom <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and
<PB N="48" REF="003413_0054_10036A5165B4D118"><HI>Aaron</HI> the Prie&s;t numbred, when they numbred the Chil|dren of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in the Wilderne&s;s of <HI>Sinai.

<P>Here al&s;o may be &s;ubjoyned the before cited, <HI>Deuterono|my,</HI> Chap. II. ver&s;es 14, 15, 16. <HI>And the &s;pace in which we came from Kade&s;h Barnea, until we were come over the Brook Zered, was thirty and eight Years, until all the Generation of the</HI> MEN OF WAR, <HI>were wa&s;ted out from among the Ho&s;t, as the LORD Sware unto them; for indeed the Hand of the LORD was again&s;t them to de&s;troy them from among the Ho&s;t until they were con|&s;umed: &s;o it came to pa&s;s, when all the</HI> MEN OF WAR <HI>were con&s;umed and dead from among the People,</HI> &amp;c. The&s;e words are &s;o plain in favour of the <HI>Levites,</HI> that they need no Commentary or Inference.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, it can by no means be maintained, That no other Men entred <HI>Canaan</HI> that were twenty Years of Age at their coming out of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> &s;ave JOSHUA and CALEB, as the Learned <HI>Author</HI> of the <HI>Chronological Connection,</HI> &amp;c. a&s;&s;erts. All that can be &s;afely &s;aid is, That of 603550 effective Men of the Age of twenty Years and upwards, that were Polled at Mount <HI>Sinai</HI> by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and

The <HI>&s;econd</HI> Poll of this Tribe, was of Men fit for the &s;ervice of the <HI>Tabernacle,</HI> viz. between the Age of <HI>Thirty</HI> and <HI>Fifty,</HI> and amounted to 8580, <HI>Chap.</HI> IV.

<P>I &s;hall now Con&s;ider, and An&s;wer the two principal Places relyed on, in favour of the common Opinion.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="50" REF="003413_0056_10036A5763117290">
<HI>I.</HI> The fir&s;t is <HI>Numbers</HI> XIV. v. 2. <HI>ALL the Children of I&s;rael Murmured again&s;t Mo&s;es,</HI> &amp;c. Ver&s;e 10. <HI>ALL the Congregation bad Stone them with Stones:</HI> And ver&s;e 22. <HI>Becau&s;e ALL the&s;e Men which have &s;een my Glory,</HI> &amp;c, <HI>&s;urely they &s;hall not &s;ee the Land,</HI> &amp;c. From hence it is argued, That the <HI>Levites</HI> were part of the Congrega|tion, and of &s;o among the <HI>Murmurers,</HI> and therefore came under the Sentence of Exclu&s;ion as well as the reft.</P>
<P>To this it is An&s;wered,</P>
<P><HI>Sol.</HI> 1. That the whole Chapter being taken together (as it ought) 'twill appear, who the Murmurers, or Mu|tineers were: For tho' in the 27th. ver&s;e it be &s;aid, <HI>I have beard the Murmurings of the Children of I&s;rael,</HI> Indefi|nitely; yet in the 29th ver&s;e, we have plainly a Re&s;triction; for the Words are, <HI>Your Carca&s;&s;es &s;hall fall in this Wilder|ne&s;s, and</HI> ALL THAT WERE NUMBERED <HI>of you, according to your whole number from twenty Years old and upward, which have murmured again&s;t me,</HI> &amp;c. So that if GOD him&s;elf, who was the Judge, charged the Mutiny or Murmuring only upon tho&s;e that were <HI>Num|bered</HI> in the fir&s;t Mu&s;ter by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> at Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> viz. From twenty Years old and upwards; who &s;hall charge it upon the <HI>Levites,</HI> who were not in that Roll?</P>
<P N="2">2. It is plain from the Hi&s;tory, that the <HI>Evil Report</HI> brought of the Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> by the <HI>Spies,</HI> or tho&s;e
<PB N="51" REF="003413_0057_10036A620FBB5418">Men that were &s;ent by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to &s;earch out the Land, was the next and great <HI>Occa&s;ion</HI> of that <HI>Murmuring</HI> and <HI>Mu|tiny</HI> of the Children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> which excluded them the promis'd Land: Now the Tribe of <HI>Levi</HI> had <HI>no Repre&s;en|tatine</HI> among tho&s;e <HI>Spies,</HI> as may be &s;een at large in the XIII <HI>Chap.</HI> of <HI>Numbers,</HI> where the Spies and the &s;everal Tribes they were re&s;pectively taken from, are expre&s;s'd by Name. And therefore, however it might Fare with any <HI>particular Levite</HI> (if any &s;uch there were) concern'd in that Rebellion, yet the Tribe of LEVI, <HI>as a Tribe,</HI> could not in ju&s;tice fall under the terrible Sentence of Exclu&s;ion. In like manner, had the <HI>Tribes</HI> of <HI>Judah</HI> and <HI>Ephraim</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves on this Occa&s;ion, and &s;tood by the Report of <HI>Caleb</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> who were &s;ent and in&s;tructed by them, it is probable they had likewife been Exempted: but in&s;tead of that, the <HI>Principals</HI> of the&s;e Tribes, <HI>viz. Judah</HI> and <HI>Ephraim,</HI> ba&s;ely de&s;erted them, and turned over to the <HI>other Ten Spies,</HI> and therefore were ju&s;tly involved in the &s;ame common ruin.</P>
<P N="3">3. Be&s;ides which, it is very unlikely, that the <HI>Levites</HI> who had but a little before, <HI>viz.</HI> in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the <HI>Golden Calf,</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves from the Re&s;t of the Congregation, by appearing with <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> on the LORD's <HI>&s;ide;</HI> or as the Expre&s;&s;ion is, <HI>Con&s;ecrated</HI> them&s;elves that day unto the LORD, and thereby obtained a Ble&s;&s;ing; I &s;ay it is very unlikely, that they &s;hould &s;o &s;oon after engage in this Mutiny, and be found among the <HI>Murmurers;</HI>
<PB N="52" REF="003413_0058_10034EF45E98DED8">e&s;pecially if it be con&s;idered, what <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;ays of that Tribe in his la&s;t Ble&s;&s;ing, <HI>Deut.</HI> XXXII. 9. <HI>They have ob&s;erved thy Word, and kept thy Covenant.</HI></P>

<PB N="53" REF="003413_0059_10036A6535B40FE8">Generation that did Evil in the &s;ight of the <HI>LORD,</HI> and were con&s;umed, as noticed in the XXXII Chapter of <HI>Num|bers,</HI> were the Generation of the <HI>Men of War,</HI> again&s;t whom the Hand of the <HI>LORD</HI> was, and who dyed, and were con&s;umed, as the <HI>LORD</HI> Swear unto them: Thus <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> him&s;elf explains it.

<P>I come now to take a brief Notice, of the <HI>Mi&s;take</HI> I hinted at, touching the AGE of ELEAZER the Prie&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>Author</HI> of the <HI>Chronological Connection,</HI> before|mentioned, Affirms that <HI>Eleazer</HI> and <HI>Ithamar</HI> Sons of <HI>Aaron</HI> could not be twenty Years old at the coming out of <HI>Aegypt.</HI> The truth of it is, He that will A&s;&s;ert, that every Man of the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> that came out of <HI>Aegypt</HI> at twenty Years of Age (&s;ave CALEB and JOSHUA) dyed in the Wilderne&s;s; will be under a Ne|ce&s;&s;ity
<PB N="54" REF="003413_0060_10036A6BB1EFCC58">of &s;aying, that ELEAZER was under twenty Years, when he came out of <HI>Egypt:</HI> For it is mo&s;t certain, that be went into <HI>Canaan</HI> with <HI>Jo&s;hua.</HI> But let us a little Examine the particular Ca&s;e of ELEAZER.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t mention that we find of him, is <HI>Exodus</HI> VI. 23, &amp; 25. <HI>And ELEAZER Aaron's Son took him one of the Daughters of</HI> Putiel <HI>to Wife, and &s;he bove him</HI> Phineas, <HI>&amp;c. The&s;e are the HEADS of the FATHERS of the LEVITES, according to their Families.</HI> Here <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> ELEAZER is taken notice of, as one that had been Married &s;ometime, and al&s;o the Birth of his Son <HI>Phineas,</HI> that was &s;o famous in the Wilderne&s;s. <HI>Secondly;</HI> the Text reckons ELEAZER, among the <HI>Heads</HI> of the <HI>Fathers</HI> of the <HI>Levites:</HI> and is it probable that all this while he &s;hould be under the Age of <HI>Twenty?</HI> It cannot be. In the next place, I would have it con&s;idered, that ELEAZER entred upon, and executed the <HI>Prie&s;ts Office</HI> in the Wilderne&s;s, in the Second Year after their coming out of <HI>Egypt:</HI> See <HI>Levit.</HI> VIII. 9, 10. particu|larly Chap. X. ver&s;e 16 to the end. Now the <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> were not to enter upon their Office till <HI>thirty</HI> Years of Age, <HI>Numbers</HI> IV. 1, 2, 3. Moreover the Figure that <HI>Eleazer</HI> made in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and quickly after their coming from thence, be&s;peaks him not only a Per&s;on of Gravity, but a Man of Years. JOSHUA was <HI>forty-five</HI> Years old when the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> came out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and yet he is called a Young Man. The&s;e two famous Worthies JOSHUA and ELEAZER entred into <HI>Canaan</HI> together; and by the Hi&s;tory &s;eemed to have dyed about the &s;ame
<PB N="55" REF="003413_0061_10036A7451C15960">time. And it is very probable they might be near of an Age, as MOSES and AARON their Prodece&s;&s;ors were. However that be, I &s;ubmit it to the Learned, Whether upon the whole it be probable, much le&s;s certain, that ELEAZER was under <HI>Twenty</HI> Years of Age, when the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> came out of <HI>Egypt.</HI></P>
<P>P. S. <HI>It was no &s;mall Satisfaction to me, after I had drawn up the Materials of this Exercitation, and in a manner dige&s;ted it, to find the Learned Mon&s;ieur</HI> Saurin <HI>him&s;elf of the &s;ame Opinion, to|wards the</HI> end <HI>of his</HI> Vol. <HI>before-mentioned,</HI> viz. <HI>pag.</HI> 561. <HI>tho' he &s;ays nothing as to the ca&s;e of</HI> Eleazer <HI>in particular.

<HEAD>The <HI>ORACLE</HI> OF The TRUE GOD Compar'd with <HI>tho&s;e</HI> of the <HI>Heathen.</HI> IN An OCCASIONAL MEDITATION On I. <HI>Samuel</HI> XXIII. 11, 12.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG the various ways or divers manners wherein GOD was plea&s;ed to &s;peak to the Fathers in times pa&s;t, the An&s;wers given from before the HOLY ORACLE was one. This Method indeed was not u&s;ed, upon ordinary Occa&s;ions, but <HI>pro re nata,</HI> in ca&s;es of extraordinary Difficulty and Importance, e&s;pecially when the Public was concerned. How or in what manner the&s;e Oracular Re&s;pon&s;es were given, I &s;hall not here determine. The Learned cannot agree upon it. The <HI>Jews</HI> &s;ay the An&s;wer was under&s;tood and taken from the <HI>Lu&s;tre</HI> with which the <HI>Stones</HI> in the Brea&s;t-Plate of the High Prie&s;t &s;hone at that time. Some of the Learned are of Opinion, that an <HI>Articulate Voice</HI> was heard from within the <HI>Sanctum Sanctorum.</HI> And
<PB N="57" REF="003413_0063_10036A7D04A26E90">other, that it was by an extraordinary <HI>Impre&s;&s;ion</HI> upon the <HI>Mind</HI> of the <HI>High Prie&s;t,</HI> who may be &s;uppo&s;ed at that time to be in &s;uch a frame of Spirit as was &s;uited to receive and infallibly to judge of the Revelation. That which &s;eems mo&s;t probable to me is, That this Sacred and My&s;|terious Ordinance was under the Direction &amp; Management of the <HI>High Prie&s;t,</HI> or the Per&s;on who executed that Office: And that accordingly He declared the Mind and Will of GOD upon the matter. For this &s;ee <HI>Numbers</HI> XXVII. 21. I. <HI>Sam.</HI> XXX. 7, 8. <HI>Nehemiah</HI> VII. 65. In imi|tation of <HI>this Oracle,</HI> the Nations that Corre&s;ponded with the <HI>Jews,</HI> and e&s;pecially the <HI>Grecians,</HI> in honour of their Gods, &s;et up Oracles in their Temples. But as the Portion of <HI>Jacob</HI> was not like tho&s;e Dunghill Deities, &s;o neither were their Vanities and work of Errors to be com|pared with the <HI>Oracle</HI> of the true and living GOD.</P>
<P>Here, among other things it might be ob&s;erv'd, That <HI>Acce&s;s</HI> to the Heathen Oracles was <HI>difficult,</HI> and only to be had at <HI>&s;et times.</HI> The Learned Dr. <HI>Potter</HI> in his <HI>Grecian Antiquities,</HI> tells us, That the Time of Con&s;ulting the Oracle of <HI>Delphos</HI> at fir&s;t was only <HI>one Month</HI> in the Year, and the <HI>Seventh Day</HI> of that Month; and in the latter Ages, Oracles us'd only to be given <HI>once</HI> every Month. Whereas the Oracle of GOD &s;tood continually open to the humble &amp; true Wor&s;hipper; agreeable to that of the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> LX. 11. <HI>Her Gates &s;hall be open coptinually, they &s;hall not be &s;hut Day nor Night.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="003413_0064_10036A824F863E40">

<P>But the great Difference between the <HI>Divine Oracle</HI> and tho&s;e of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> which I would ob&s;erve from
<PB N="59" REF="003413_0065_10036A85F8C65128">the Words under Con&s;ideration, is the <HI>Nature</HI> or <HI>Property</HI> of the <HI>Re&s;pon&s;es</HI> given: For while the An&s;wers of the Heathen Oracles were dark and eva&s;ive, doubtful and precarious; tho&s;e delivered by the Oracle of JEHOVAH, were plain and conci&s;e, certam and &s;a&s;e, even to a Proverb, as we learn from I. Sam. XVI. 23. <HI>And the Coun&s;el of</HI> ACHITOPHEL <HI>was, as if a Man bad enquired at the</HI> ORACLE <HI>of</HI> GOD. A very remarkable proof and in&s;tance of this, we have here Recorded by the Prophet <HI>Samuel. David</HI> being in great di&s;tre&s;s, and at a lo&s;s what to do, has recour&s;e to the <HI>Oracle</HI> of GOD, and humbly propo&s;es <HI>two Que&s;tions.</HI> 1. Whether <HI>Saul</HI> would really come down after him? 2. Whether the Men of <HI>Keilah</HI> (to whom he had been &s;uch a Protector) would deliver him up to <HI>Saul?</HI> To the&s;e two &s;hort, but impor|tant Que&s;tions, <HI>David</HI> receives a full, plain An&s;wer: To the fir&s;t SAUL <HI>will come down;</HI> to the &s;econd, <HI>The Men of</HI> Keilah <HI>will deliver thee up.</HI> What a lively Oracle was here, and how plain was <HI>David</HI>'s way made before him? See al&s;o an In&s;tance of the &s;ame nature, in I. <HI>Sam.</HI> XXX. 6, 7, 8.</P>
<P>But now let us &s;ee what Treatment Idolaters were wont to meet with from their wretched Oracles, when they re&s;or|ted to them for Coun&s;el in matters of the greate&s;t Importance. Their Re&s;pon&s;es were either &s;o Dark and Uncertain, that nothing at all could be made of them; or el&s;e the Words were &s;o ambiguous, and contrived with &s;uch a double
<PB N="60" REF="003413_0066_10036A8C04220F48"><HI>entendre,</HI> that they might be interpreted both ways, in the Affirmative or Negative, like that doubtful Sentence, <HI>Ibis redibis nunquam per bella peribis;</HI> which has <HI>two Meanings,</HI> according as you refer the Word <HI>Nunquam.</HI> And yet <HI>Plutarch,</HI> in his Treati&s;e of the <HI>Pythian</HI> Oracle, makes an Apology, &s;uch a one as 'tis, for the Ob&s;curity and double Meaning of the&s;e oracular An&s;wers. Hence it often came to pa&s;s, That the Per&s;on concerned, taking the <HI>Wrong,</HI> was Deceived and Ruined: Thus it happen'd to <HI>Pyrrhus</HI> of <HI>Epyrus,</HI> when he engaged in a War with the <HI>Romans,</HI> who had this An&s;wer from the Oracle.</P>

<P>It is generally believed from the be&s;t Authorities, both of Chri&s;tian and Heathen Writers, That the&s;e counterfeit Oracles, quickly after the coming of CHRIST, and the &s;etting up His Kingdom in the World, cea&s;ed, and came to nought.</P>
<P>As to the Oracle of GOD before-mentioned, I &s;uppo&s;e I need not inform tho&s;e that Read the Scriptures, and more e&s;pecially the Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> with care &amp; diligence, That as all the Ordinances of Divine Service under the fir&s;t Covenant, were but a Figure for that time of good thing, to come, and therefore de&s;igned from the beginning but as a temporary Di&s;pen&s;ation; &s;o when the Sub&s;tance was come tho&s;e Shadows fled away.</P>

This is treated of, and proved at large by the Apo&s;tle in his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> particularly in the VIII, IX, and Xth <HI>Chapters:</HI> And the Oracular An&s;wers above &s;poken of, being typical, and a branch of the <HI>Prophetical</HI> Office of JESUS CHRIST, were &s;uper&s;eded and laid a&s;ide when the SON OF GOD, <GAP DESC="foreign"><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> vii. 40.</NOTE>, came into the World; according to that of the Apo&s;tle to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> Chap.
