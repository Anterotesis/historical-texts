<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<P>I Do not mean to thee, that ha&s;t only the name <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> be|cau&s;e thou ha&s;t been born in a nation called &s;o, or becau&s;e thy parents were &s;o, and thou ha&s;t walked in their traditions, and made profe&s;&s;ion of that which is reputed the <HI>Chri&s;tian Re|ligion.</HI> Neither do I mean thou, that art the &s;on, daughter, &s;ervant, or hand-maid of a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> indeed; who ha&s;t been edu|cated and in&s;tructed in the principles of the <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion,</HI> not only by precept, but by example; and ha&s;t, in honour and re&s;pect of thy parents or ma&s;ter, yielded obedience &s;o far, as to walk in &s;ome mea&s;ure in the form thereof, out of the &s;uper|fluity of naughtine&s;s that is in the world; which is commen|dable in its place, time and &s;ea&s;on: Yet thou art not the <HI>Chri|&s;tian</HI> I here intend. But thou art the man or woman, who ha&s;t known &s;omething of the work and power of God in or upon thy mind, and art in &s;ome mea&s;ure quicked and made alive thereby, ha&s;t been made &s;en&s;ible of thy &s;ore bondage and cap|tivity, and ha&s;t cries and breathings begotten in thee for deli|verance, under the &s;en&s;e of thy &s;ad &s;tate and condition without a Saviour. Thou, to whom &s;in hath been a grievous burthen, with which thou ha&s;t been weary and heavy laden. Thou to whom &s;in is made exceeding &s;inful, &s;o that thou hate&s;t it, even as God hates it, <HI>viz. becau&s;e it is &s;in;</HI> and art in love with right|teou&s;ne&s;s, purity and holine&s;s, having felt the drawings of the Father to the Son thy Saviour; and thou art now in him, pre&s;|&s;ing hard to be wholly freed from the one, and to become a &s;ervant, child and friend of the other.</P>
<P>Thou art the <HI>Chri&s;tian Reader</HI> my bowels yearn towards, my care is for, and my advice is to, that thou maye&s;t per&s;evere to the end, and e&s;cape all the dangers in the way; that thou maye&s;t be acquainted with the wiles of the enemy, and with his my&s;terious working again&s;t thee, even after the &s;trong man is bound, his goods &s;poiled, and thy hou&s;e &s;wept and garni&s;hed; after thou ha&s;t clean e&s;caped the pollutions of the world, and the errors therein, and ha&s;t had much experience of the power and pre&s;ence of the Lord; even after he hath brought thee into his vineyard, into his garden, and made thee a dre&s;&s;er and keeper of it, if thou wilt receive and keep the <HI>penny</HI> (the re|ward) thou mu&s;t be diligent and watchful therein. Remember, the &s;erpent came into Paradi&s;e to deceive, and that &s;atan came
<PB N="iv" REF="013006_0003_0F8FAAE7EA15C208">before God, to accu&s;e and &s;tir him up again&s;t the righteous, and that the great red dragon got into Heaven; and not only &s;o, <HI>but made war there, and &s;tood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, to devour the child as &s;oon as it was born.</HI> And when he was overcome in Heaven, and ca&s;t into the earth and &s;ea, and among the inhabitants thereof, he cea&s;ed not to be wroth with the woman, and to <HI>make war with the remnant of her &s;eed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the te&s;timony of Je&s;us.</HI> Read <HI>Rev.</HI> xii. This hath been his work of old, and is the &s;ame at this day.</P>
<P>Seeing Paradi&s;e, the pre&s;ence of God and Heaven, are not exempted from the approaches of the &s;erpent, &s;atan and dra|gon; what great need there is for thee to be always armed again&s;t him, and to keep a watchful eye over him, e&s;pecially when he appears as a friend, as he did in Paradi&s;e, when he &s;aid, <HI>You &s;hall not die, you &s;hall be as gods.</HI> As if he had &s;aid, <HI>I am &s;o much your friend, that I am come to per&s;uade you to do &s;ome|thing to better your &s;tates, and to bring you into a greater glory: I propo&s;e nothing but what, if you obey me, &s;hall turn to your good.</HI> Thus he beguiled them then, and hath done &s;ince, and may do thee, if thou abides not in the light which di&s;covers him, and all his wiles and devices, formings and transformings. But as thine eye is &s;ingle, thou wilt always &s;ee and know him to be as he is, and not as he appears to be: So &s;halt thou never be deceived nor betrayed by him. But many a&s;&s;aults, trials, and temptations, thou mu&s;t expect from him. Amid&s;t all, keep thine eye upon God thy Saviour, who hath given thee faith in him; which faith is indeed very precious, and very power|ful, able to overcome and give thee victory over all thy ene|mies. If thou keep it, and grow in it, it will certainly be as an anchor unto thee, when &s;torms attend; as a &s;hield and brea&s;t-plate unto thee, when enemies a&s;&s;ault. Remember the coun&s;el of <HI>Paul, Silvanus</HI> and <HI>Timotheus,</HI> to the <HI>The&s;&s;alonians. Let us who are of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e day, be &s;ober, putting on the brea&s;t-plate of forth and love, and for an helmet the hope of &s;alvation; for God hath not ap|pointed us to wrath, but to obtain &s;alvation by or Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> This was the ble&s;&s;ed end of the call and appointment of God in all ages, even that all who hear and obey it, might obtain &s;alvation, <HI>the end of faith and hope;</HI> and is the &s;ame to a rem|nant in this age. Happy art thou that enjoye&s;t it, and abid|e&s;t with him that hath called thee to it, and wrought it in thee, and for thee; which is God, ble&s;&s;ed and prai&s;ed throughout all generations.</P>
<P>Now, <HI>Chri&s;tian Reader,</HI> what I have here committed to the pre&s;s, is from a deep and weighty con&s;ideration, ob&s;ervation
<PB N="v" REF="013006_0004_0F8FAAE9B44977B0">and knowledge of the glorious appearance of God in this our day, in the con&s;ciences of thou&s;ands, who have been made as clay in the hand of the potter, ready to be formed according to his will, even <HI>ve&s;&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of honour,</HI> and many have been made &s;o, and do &s;o remain; but &s;ome have been marred on the wheel. Some have mi&s;carried in the mid&s;t of the way; &s;ome have &s;ate down, &s;ome have fallen out (even with their bre|thren) by the way; &s;ome have turned out of the way, and brought an evil report upon it, and lard &s;tumbling-blocks in the way, and occa&s;ioned the way of truth to be evil &s;poken of; who&s;e damnation &s;lun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bers not. My hearty de&s;ire is, that nei|ther thou nor I may ever be of this number. What I &s;ay unto thee, I &s;ay unto my own &s;oul, <HI>Go forward to perfection.</HI> Let not the enemy of thy &s;oul beguile thee of thy exceeding great re|ward, which is laid up in &s;tore <HI>for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">li that love the appearance of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and that join therewith, and work therein,</HI> till all the works of God are fini&s;hed, and till all the works of &s;in, &s;elf and &s;atan, are wrought out and de&s;troyed, and thou fully delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the children of God. This thou maye&s;t have longed for and breathed after, and art now called to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and enjoyment of; and not only &s;o, but to the abiding and &s;tanding fa&s;t therein; &s;o thou &s;halt never be entangled with the yoke of bondage again, nor turn back in thy heart to <HI>Egypt;</HI> nor ever hunger nor thir&s;t after the forbidden f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">it again. So to him that is able to keep thee from falling, and to the word of his grace (in thy heart) I recommend thee; which as thou keepe&s;t unto, and learne&s;t of, thou wilt be enabled to per&s;e|vere &s;afely to the end, and in the end lie down in peace, and know the God of peace to keep thy heart in peace. This is the ble&s;&s;ed fruit and effect of righteou&s;ne&s;s, of well-doing, di|ligence and watchfulne&s;s; which as thou art found in, grace and peace will be multiplied in and to thee, through the know|ledge of God, and Je&s;us our Lord, who hath called us to glory and virtue: To whom be prai&s;e forever more.</P>

<P>To &s;uch my earne&s;t reque&s;t is, (even in love and good-will to you) &s;eeing you &s;ay you love, believe and honour the <HI>Scrip|tures;</HI> that you would &s;hew your&s;elves like the <HI>Bereans,</HI> with an unprejudiced mind &s;earch the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> e&s;pecially the&s;e fol|lowing. Be &s;erious, take lea&s;ure to read them, meditate a little, laying a&s;ide thy carnal thoughts, and that wi&s;dom which is from beneath, which darkneth the coun&s;el of God, and wre&s;teth the <HI>Scriptures.</HI> Then thou maye&s;t clearly perceive, that it is no new doctrine to preach the <HI>Light,</HI> nor error to a&s;&s;ent that it is the way of God, that leadeth all that turn to it and walk in it, into true <HI>Chri&s;tianity.</HI> If any objection ari&s;eth and remaineth in thy mind, concerning the way of God here borne te&s;timony to; if any words that can be read, writ or &s;poken, are able to give thee a &s;atisfactory convincing an&s;wer thereto, the <HI>Scriptures</HI> are tho&s;e words, e&s;pecially to thee that profe&s;&s;e&s;t an honour and obedience to them.</P>
<P>But this, in &s;hort, I te&s;tify, That if thou &s;light the gift of God, the manife&s;tation of his Spirit, light and grace be&s;towed upon thee, and given unto thee, as one talent at lea&s;t to im|prove, thou can&s;t not under&s;tand nor receive the te&s;timony of the Scriptures. If thou ha&s;t any de&s;ire to under&s;tand the <HI>holy Scriptures,</HI> and things of God, thou mu&s;t come to know and love the <HI>Light, Law</HI> and <HI>Spirit of God,</HI> and feel the operation of it in thy own heart, to fit and prepare thee to under&s;tand the divine my&s;teries of his kingdom, and to inherit them; untill which, though thou maye&s;t account thy&s;elf wi&s;e, rich and full, and may be cloathed with a profe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> yet thou art poor, blind, mi&s;erable and naked; covered with a cover|ing, but not with the &s;pirit of the Lord, not with a meek and quiet &s;pirit; not with a Chri&s;t like &s;pirit; not with the &s;pirit of the primitive <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>
<P>So thou art not in a capacity to under&s;tand their words, tho' thou may&s;t profe&s;s them as the <HI>Jews</HI> did the <HI>Law</HI> and the <HI>Pro|phets,</HI> yet per&s;ecuted him of whom they te&s;tified. That thou may&s;t avoid doing the &s;ame, I coun&s;el thee to receive the grace, light and &s;pirit of God, which appears in thee, and &s;hines un|to thee, in order to lead and guide thee unto everla&s;ting life. This is the will of God, and the de&s;ire of his people, that all men might come to the knowledge of the truth and be &s;aved; not only from condemnation and puni&s;hment, but from com|mitting <HI>&s;in,</HI> the cau&s;e thereof.</P>

<P>THOU may&s;t perceive and under&s;tand by the&s;e &s;criptures, that righteous men and <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> in ages pa&s;t, were wit|ne&s;&s;es of the <HI>light</HI> of God &s;hining in them; of the <HI>Word, Law, Power, Grace,</HI> and <HI>Love</HI> of God manife&s;ting, appearing and operating in them; which if thou art a &s;tranger to, thou can&s;t neither be a truly righteous man, nor a real <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> profe&s;s what thon wilt.</P>
<P>Many who profe&s;s God, Chri&s;t and <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> are fallen in|to &s;uch gro&s;s carnality, that to &s;peak or write to them of the &s;piritual appearance and work of God, in and by his <HI>Light, Law, Grace, Spirit,</HI> &amp;c. and the powerful operations thereof within upon the mind, will, under&s;tanding and con&s;cience, &s;eems &s;o &s;trange, &s;o new, &s;o incredible, that they can in no wi&s;e pay any regard unto it; but rather mock and deride there|at, as if they had never &s;een nor read the holy &s;criptures; who&s;e te&s;timony thereto is as clear as the morning without clouds. This is an evident &s;ign, that their eyes are clo&s;ed, their hearts and ears are gro&s;s and dull of hearing, their un|der&s;tanding dark, and their minds &s;o carnal, that they are be|come dead; <HI>for, to be carnally minded is death.</HI></P>
<P>In this death, the carnal-minded man can talk of the fame of wi&s;dom, but po&s;&s;e&s;s and inherit folly, and lie down in for|row. This condition is much lamented by a little remnant, who are ready to &s;ay in love and good-will to their neighbours and countrymen, <HI>Come hither and we will tell you what the Lord hath done for our &s;ouls;</HI> which were as yours are, in death and darkne&s;s, in bondage and captivity, even while profe&s;&s;ors of better things. The end of every true <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> in writing, printing, preaching, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is, that people might come to have the eye of their under&s;tanding opened, and know the day-&s;tar to ari&s;e in their hearts, that they may &s;ee their way out of death, ignorance and carnality, and receive the light of life, and therein wi&s;dom to under&s;tand and receive the &s;ayings of holy men, recorded in the holy &s;criptures; until which, they will wre&s;t them to their own de&s;truction, and never truly un|der&s;tand nor receive the comfort of them, nor of any words proceeding from the &s;ame &s;pirit of God in this age. This is the word of truth to all it may concern, which, together with the &s;criptures I have quoted, I intend &s;hall &s;erve for an&s;wer to all objections that &s;hall be made by the nominal <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> or
<PB N="xiv" REF="013006_0013_0F8FAAF2B0D69040">bare profe&s;&s;or of Chri&s;t and <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> into who&s;e hand this little book may come; knowing a&s;&s;uredly, that there is no end of contending with &s;uch with pen, ink and paper: But however, I can in truth &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf their friend.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Some <HI>REASONS</HI> why the <HI>holy Scriptures</HI> are to be e&s;teemed and preferred, by true <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> above other Writings, though from the &s;ame Spirit, in this Generation.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. BECAUSE they give an account of the divers di&s;pen&s;a|tions and operations of God, before and after the fall, in order to lead mankind out of the fall, and to re&s;tore him into his primitive &s;tate again. The manner, method and or|der of which, is, in the depth of the wi&s;dom of God, decla|red and &s;et forth in the holy &s;criptures to the man of God, more than in any other book what&s;oever.</P>
<P N="2">II. Becau&s;e therein are recorded the te&s;timonies and expe|rience of many righteous men, throughout all tho&s;e various di&s;pen&s;ations, appearances and operations of God before the law, under the law and prophets, and al&s;o under the Go&s;pel; being all briefly and plainly &s;et forth to the man of God, for the increa&s;e of his learning, encouragement of his hope, &s;trengthening of his faith, and confirming of his confidence.</P>
<P N="3">III. Becau&s;e the nominal <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> pretends he hath a great e&s;teem for the &s;criptures, and cries them up for his only rule, to walk and order his conver&s;ation by; &s;o that the true <HI>Chri|&s;tian,</HI> and Mini&s;ter of <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> hath a great advantage there|by, in order to reprove, per&s;uade and convince him, that he doth not obey, nor walk according to his own profe&s;&s;ed rule.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Becau&s;e it is the cu&s;tom, nature and practice of the &s;pirit of darkne&s;s, deceit and per&s;ecution, to de&s;pi&s;e, &s;light and contemn righteous men, their words and writings, while they live; and to garni&s;h their &s;epulchres, and profe&s;s honor to them when they are dead; &s;o though it be but in words, that they advance them above them&s;elves, as their rule and guide, they are of great &s;ervice to the true <HI>Cri&s;tian</HI> and Mini|&s;ter of <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> for the detection and conviction of gain|&s;ayers,
<PB N="xv" REF="013006_0014_0F8FAAF3A3590E98">and vindication of his doctrine and practice, life and conver&s;ation; therefore to be e&s;teemed above other writings, they being in &s;ome &s;ort as a wall of defence unto him.</P>
<P N="5">V. Becau&s;e the general good and &s;alvation of all mankind, is the principal aim and end of the true <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Mini&s;ter; and &s;eeing in this part of the world called <HI>Chri&s;ten|dom,</HI> people profe&s;s a great reverence and e&s;teem for the writ|ings of holy men in generations of old; not much regarding what is written from the &s;ame &s;pirit in holy men in the pre|&s;ent age, though one with the &s;criptures; as Chri&s;t convinced the <HI>Jews</HI> out of the law and the prophets, and <HI>Paul</HI> the <HI>Athe|nians</HI> out of their own poets: So the true <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> and Mini|&s;ter of Chri&s;t, who hath unity with the &s;criptures, and with the holy men's &s;pirits that gave them forth, have the &s;ame ad|vantage now again&s;t tho&s;e that only profe&s;s them in words, and live not the life they exhort to and call for. For this rea|&s;on we have good cau&s;e to value them above other books, tho' written from the &s;ame &s;pirit in this age; becau&s;e tho&s;e people, who want the &s;alvation the &s;criptures bear witne&s;s of, may come to be made wi&s;e through faith unto &s;alvation by them.</P>

<P>Ha&s;t thou travelled out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> through the red &s;ea and wilderne&s;s? and ha&s;t thou known the right arm of the Lord accompanying thee, and &s;upporting thee in thy trials, temp|tations and be&s;etments thou ha&s;t met with therein?

<P>I &s;ay, thou wilt certainly enjoy and inherit the&s;e things, and receive not only addition of virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to thy faith, but al&s;o the very end of thy faith; for faith and hope hath an end, and it is a ble&s;&s;ed thing to receive the end thereof, even &s;alvation; and there is none but &s;uch as endure to the end, that can be &s;aved, even to the end of the work of God, of the new creation of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P>Many may begin well, and make a good progre&s;s al&s;o, and yet fall &s;hort. They may know the fir&s;t day's work.

The appearance of light they hate; &s;o it &s;hines in darkne&s;s, and is not divided, and darkne&s;s cannot comprehend it, cannot give true names to things, cannot call the light, day; nor the darkne&s;s, night; but err and mi&s;take &s;o far, as to call the light, darkne&s;s; and the darkne&s;s, light: This all men in the fall are proue to and found doing, under the old heavens, and upon the old earth.&mdash;<HI>This is a note by the way, to tho&s;e it doth concern.</HI></P>
<P>But to proceed; they may al&s;o know the &s;econd and third day's work; <HI>The firmament in the mid&s;t of the waters; the waters divided; the dry land appear, and bring forth &s;eed and fruit after its kind, which is good.</HI> This is more than words, names and profe&s;&s;ions.

Wherefore keep in the domini|on, power and wi&s;dom, which God hath endued, armed and &s;urrounded thee withal, and he &s;hall never prevail again&s;t thee.

It is the man of God only, that hath the comfort of the &s;criptures, and that hath unity and fellow&s;hip with the holy men's &s;pirits that gave them forth. It is he alone that under&s;tands them. They are as a &s;ealed book to the learned and unlearned, to the pro|fe&s;&s;or, or nominal <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> and prophane. Great is the my|&s;tery of godline&s;s which is revealed to babes, and hid from the wi&s;e and prudent &s;chool-men of this world, who make a trade of the hi&s;tory of godline&s;s for filthy lucre's &s;ake, to the danger of their own &s;ouls and others.</P>
<P>Now, tender friend, that thou may&s;t per&s;evere &s;afely in thy way, always remember the coun&s;el of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, <HI>Take heed or pray that your flight be not in the winter, nor upon the &s;abbath-day.</HI> The&s;e two &s;ea&s;ons are the mo&s;t dangerous.

<P>Thus I have briefly &s;hewed how the inward work, or new creation of God, holds parallel with the hi&s;tory of the out|ward or old creation, and what danger attends thee, when thou art a plant of God, even in Paradi&s;e it&s;elf, which man lo&s;t through di&s;obedience and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>Yet con&s;ider, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e things, and all their experiences of the out-&s;tretched hand, power and pre&s;ence of the Lord, his promi&s;es to the obedient, and his threatnings to the rebellious and di&s;obedient, yet they forgot the Lord, turn|ed back in their hearts, and &s;o through unbelief, murmuring and di&s;obedience, fell by the way, and never entered into re&s;t, into the promi&s;ed land that flowed with milk and honey.

<P>The&s;e things are written for the learning and warning of the wi&s;e in heart, who&s;e eye God hath opened, and to
<PB N="6" REF="013006_0020_0F8FAAF91FC5F8E0">whom he hath revealed his arm of power, and done many wondrous works in and for them: that they turn not again into folly, carele&s;ne&s;s, wantonne&s;s, pride and rebellion again&s;t the &s;pirit of God: that they deck not them&s;elves with God's jewels, and play the harlot with them, as tho&s;e did, and &s;o re|ceive the like reward in the my&s;tery as they did in the hi&s;to|ry; of which there is as great danger now in the inward, as there was then in the outward. Likewi&s;e in the di&s;pen&s;ation of the &s;pirit, in the end of the prophets, I may al&s;o hint at the work of God therein, and &s;hew that the &s;ame danger at|tends mankind in the way thereof. The my&s;tery of godline&s;s is great, and the my&s;tery of iniquity is great al&s;o, and happy art thou if thou abides in the light of God, which makes them both manife&s;t. It is not enough to know the light to &s;hine; but to walk and abide in it, and be a true child of it. It is not enough to know the &s;pirit of truth, and the power of it; but to be led by it, joined to it, become one with it, and to bring forth the fruit thereof. It is not enough to know the &s;eed of the kingdom, and the &s;owing of it; but its breaking through the clods, and growing up, not only into the &s;talk and blade, but into the full ear and corn; and not only &s;o, but to be reaped and gathered into the garner, for the u&s;e of the Lord of the harve&s;t. It is not enough to know one of the days of the &s;on of man, the child born, and the &s;on given; but the government upon his &s;houlders, he reigning in thy heart, his and thy enemies de&s;troyed. To attain thereto, according to the phra&s;e u&s;ed in the holy &s;criptures, There is an over&s;ha|dowing of the Holy Gho&s;t to be known, a begetting and form|ing Chri&s;t within to be known, and a travailing to bring forth, a being born, and a growing up from one &s;tature to another; from a child to a young man, from a young man to an elder, and a &s;uffering with Chri&s;t; a taking up his cro&s;s daily and following him: a dying with him; and a ri&s;ing with him, and a &s;eeking tho&s;e things which are above, where Chri&s;t &s;itteth at the right hand of God. Thou mu&s;t be ri&s;en with Chri&s;t, be|fore thou art in a capacity to &s;eek tho&s;e things that are at the right hand of God; but it is a farther &s;tate to find them, and to be &s;eated in an heavenly place in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and to &s;it down in the kingdom with <HI>Abrabam, Ijaac</HI> and <HI>Jacob;</HI> and the farthe&s;t and greate&s;t &s;tare of all, is to know <HI>the kingdom delive|red up unto the Father, and God become all in all;</HI> where the alone &s;afety is. Till which, though thou art a di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t, and become as a cha&s;te wi&s;e virgin e&s;pou&s;ed unto him, thou mu&s;t watch and pray, keep thy lamp trimmed, and thy light burning, le&s;t thou enter into temptation; le&s;t thou &s;lumber

<P>So, dear friend, thou may&s;t perceive by what I have briefly hinted, by the current of the holy &s;criptures, and by thy own experience, that it is no ea&s;y thing to be a true <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> to go through the work of regeneration, of the new creation of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. It is no ea&s;y thing to go through the warfare, and be able to &s;ay with the Apo&s;tle, <HI>I have fought a good fight, I have fini&s;hed my cour&s;e, henceforth there is a crown of glory laid up for me;</HI> and to come to the wearing of the crown, and to be more than a conquerer in him that hath loved thee.</P>
<P>The&s;e things to witne&s;s and enjoy, is the ble&s;&s;ed end of all the di&s;pen&s;ations of God &s;ince the fall. He that is the over|comer, is more than a conquerer, he hath received the <HI>white &s;tone, wherein the new name is written, which none knoweth but he that hath it.</HI> He is the wi&s;e merchant-man, <HI>that hath &s;old all and purcha&s;ed the pearl of great pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e,</HI> which excels all things be&s;ide. He hath a right to eat of the tree of life, which grows in the mid&s;t of the garden. He is ble&s;&s;ed with all &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings, in heavenly places in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. He is a co-heir, a joint-heir with him; and not only &s;o, but he is come into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his inheritance. This is his &s;tate, though he may meet with no better entertainment in the world, than Chri&s;t the captain of his &s;alvation, and his di&s;ciples did.</P>
<P>So it is thy enjoying of the light of God's countenance, thy
<PB N="8" REF="013006_0022_0F8FAAFB36079E88">being joined to the Lord, and being become one &s;pirit with him, thy knowing the marriage-union, thy maker to be thy hu&s;band; that is thy comfort, thy rejoicing, thy crown and dia|dem in pro&s;perity and in adver&s;ity; in heights and in depths in the palace and in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ngeon; in all &s;tates, times and places. Thou art the only happy man, that art partaker of the&s;e things, though thy goods may be &s;poiled, and thy body in the hands of thy enemics; yet thou can&s;t really &s;eal to the truth of that te&s;timony of <HI>Paul,</HI> Rom. viii. 18. <HI>I reckon that the &s;ufferings of this pre&s;ent time, are not worthy to be compared to the glory that &s;hall be revealed in us.</HI> To the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> this time of re|velation is come; thou knowe&s;t the Lord come, and his re|ward is with him <HI>an hundred fold,</HI> even <HI>in this time, and in the world to come, life everla&s;ting.

<P>Con&s;ider and be warned, by the examples recorded in the holy &s;criptures; always remember, that they tell thee of a people that came to the knowledge of God, his laws and or|dinances, and manner of wor&s;hip which he him&s;elf commanded, which while performed in &s;incerity of heart, he was well plea&s;ed with, and his ble&s;&s;ings and pre&s;ence accompanied them; but when they lo&s;t &s;incerity, uprightne&s;s and integrity of heart, though they kept in the exact practice and per|formance of the outward part of wor&s;hip, yet all their per|formances were abomination to him, and rejected by him. This is te&s;tified by his prophet <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> &s;aying, <HI>He that killeth an ox, is as if he &s;lew a man; he that &s;acrificeth a lamb, is as if he cut off a dog</HI>'s <HI>neck; he that offereth an oblation, as if he offered &s;wines blood; he that burneth incen&s;e, as if he ble&s;&s;ed an idol.</HI> This is mighty &s;trange to tho&s;e that know not the real cau&s;e of it, that tho&s;e &s;ervices commanded, &s;hould become &s;o abominable in the &s;ight of him who commanded them. God looks at the heart, at the in&s;ide; if that be gone a&s;tray, if that be cor|rupted, degenerated, and fallen in love with the creatures, he accepts of nothing <HI>as well done</HI> from man in that &s;tate; his righteou&s;ne&s;s and his wickedne&s;s are both abomination to him. This was a &s;ore evil the people fell into under the di&s;pen&s;ation of the law; <HI>they kept &s;inning and &s;acrificing, but neglected to hear and obey the voice of the Lord.</HI> Likewi&s;e in the di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel, even in the fir&s;t ages of it, the like evil was
<PB N="9" REF="013006_0023_0F8FAAFBF82D35D8">creeping in. By the preaching of the Apo&s;tles, many were brought to believe in Chri&s;t, and to make profe&s;&s;ion of him; and it &s;oon grew to this pa&s;s with &s;ome, that they were ready to &s;it down, or re&s;t in profe&s;&s;ion and knowledge of Chri&s;t after the fle&s;h, and to ob&s;erve the form of godline&s;s, but deny and neglect the power.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, in the primitive times, had a great work before them,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> To per&s;uade and convince the <HI>Jews,</HI> that Je&s;us was the Chri&s;t of God, the <HI>Me&s;&s;ias</HI> promi&s;ed and prophe&s;ied of by the holy prophets, whom they per&s;ecuted and &s;lew in one age, and honoured at lea&s;t with their lips, and garni&s;hed their &s;epulchres in another.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> To oppo&s;e the continuance of their temple wor|&s;hip, &s;hadowy and typical ordinances and ob&s;ervances, which God once commanded; and to bring them from under them to the thing &s;ignified by them; and to believe in him who was the end and &s;ub&s;tance thereof, who did fulfil all righteou&s;ne&s;s contained in the law, in the prophets and <HI>John.</HI> When they had brought people to believe, that Chri&s;t was the great pro|phet which God had promi&s;ed to rai&s;e up like unto <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> how ready were many of the&s;e believers to &s;it down in this belief, and to content them&s;elves with a knowledge of Chri&s;t after the fle&s;h; like as the <HI>Jews</HI> plea&s;ed them&s;elves with the temple of the Lord, and with their outward ob&s;ervances, while they wanted the root of the matter, <HI>viz. An upright, broken, contrite heart;</HI> which is and was the only &s;acrifice God delighted in. So they were con&s;trained to te&s;tify again&s;t the bare knowledge of Chri&s;t after the fle&s;h, <HI>Henceforth we know no man after the fle&s;h; yea, though we have known Chri&s;t after the fle&s;h; we know him &s;o no more:</HI> Pre&s;&s;ing the knowledge of him after the &s;pirit, revealed, manife&s;ted and known by the ope|ration of his power and &s;pirit within.

<P>So dear friend and reader, who&s;e good, in writing, I chiefly aim at, I de&s;ire thee to be weighty and &s;erious in reading, as I have been in writing, and thou wilt find the benefit and comfort thereof, as I have done, mini&s;tred into thy own bo|&s;om; and thou wilt not only clearly perceive and under&s;tand the difference between the light carele&s;s reading, hearing, profe&s;&s;ing and talking of good things, and the &s;erious weighty po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and enjoyment of them; but al&s;o betwixt the be|ginning, progre&s;s and end of the work of God in the new creation, re&s;toration, regeneration and &s;alvation.</P>
<P>So, to the grace of God which leadeth unto glory, and from one degree of glory unto another, I do heartily commend thee; which grace is &s;ufficient to teach thee all good, and pre&s;erve thee from all evil; and in the &s;ame I remain thy friend and brother.</P>

<P N="1">I. IT is a precious thing to know what <HI>the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t is, and how to take it up, and make u&s;e of it;</HI> for indeed, it is no le&s;s than <HI>the power that crucifies &s;in, and &s;aves from it;</HI> which <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> too generally being ignorant of, &s;ets up &s;omething el&s;e in&s;tead thereof, and &s;o &s;in remains alive uncrucified, and &s;alvation is wanted; for it is not all the gold, &s;ilver, and wooden cro&s;&s;es, nor voluntary humility, in the whole world, that is able to crucify one &s;in, as to the nature of it, nor to make any one di&s;ciple; nor enable to watch with Chri&s;t one hour, nor follow him one &s;tep in the regeneration.</P>
<P N="2">II. It is a ble&s;&s;ed &s;tate, to know the <HI>eye of the mind,</HI> not only opening, but <HI>opened;</HI> thereby is ability and wi&s;dom wit|ne&s;&s;ed to read in the book of life, wherein all the trea&s;ures of wi&s;dom and knowledge are hid; and he or &s;he that know|eth this light &s;hining, this eye opened in them, walks and &s;tumbles not. This eye and light within, is that which <HI>Chri&s;t|endom</HI> too much de&s;pi&s;e and reject, therefore walk in dark|ne&s;s and &s;tumble, and know not whether they go. Whil&s;t we our&s;elves did &s;o, we were darkne&s;s, walked in it, and our feet &s;tumbled upon the dark mountains.</P>
<P>That which &s;hut and &s;topped this eye, and darkned this light within, in the beginning, was &s;in and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, whereby mankind lo&s;t the &s;ight and enjoyment of his Creator. And this I te&s;tify, That no people upon the face of the earth, come to witne&s;s this <HI>eye of the mind</HI> openly again, but as they come to experience that power in them&s;elves which crucifies &s;in, and &s;aveth and redeemeth out of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and are al&s;o obedient and &s;ubject unto it.</P>
<P N="3">III. The remembrance of the <HI>fir&s;t day's work</HI> is very pre|cious, even the &s;eparation of the light from the darkne&s;s with|in, whereby we came to know each, its name and nature, and to have our minds turned from the darkne&s;s <HI>within,</HI> to the light <HI>within;</HI> from the power of &s;atan <HI>within,</HI> to the power of God <HI>within;</HI> from the teachers and books <HI>without,</HI> to the grace, the anointing, the true teacher <HI>within.</HI> The remembrance of this is very precious: And now what remains, but that we walk in this light, that we may be the children of it indeed,
<PB N="13" REF="013006_0027_0F8FAB0152A69110">and that we be always obedient to this power, and learning of this anointing, till we are fully learned. It is the &s;ub|&s;tance of all; it is the end of all words and writings; yea, it is the end of all the di&s;pen&s;ations of God &s;ince the beginning.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The precious light which &s;hineth in the heart, is the <HI>everla&s;ting day of God,</HI> in which he walks, and in which he works. ble&s;&s;ed are tho&s;e that walk with him, and work with him; they can tell of his mighty acts, and &s;peak of his won|drous works. Tho&s;e that walk in this light, and are become children of this day, are wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne&s;&s;es of the true everla&s;ting wor&s;hip, which is <HI>in the &s;pirit and in the truth.</HI> Such me come to the &s;ub&s;tance and end of all the legal admini&s;trations and temple wor&s;hip, which con&s;i&s;ted much in daily killing, and daily offering of bullocks, rains and lambs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now tho&s;e that are come to the wor&s;hip in &s;pirit, witne&s;s <HI>a daily dying, and a daily offering, till death is known.</HI> Such know, that it is ea&s;ier to kill a bullock or a ram outwardly, than to kill or mortify the bea&s;tly nature within: And it is a greater work to witne&s;s the will wholly re&s;igned up into the will of the Lord, and the thoughts and imaginations brought down into the obedience of the cro&s;s, than to perform the outward part of wor&s;hip commanded in the law. I te&s;tify to all, that tho&s;e who know not the bea&s;tly nature &s;lain, and offered up in them&s;elves, and their thoughts and wills &s;ubjected, are not come to the end of the law, nor from under it, nor to the one everla&s;ting offening, Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P N="5">V. It is very precious, not only when we meet together, but at all times, to feel <HI>our minds exerci&s;ed by, and meditating in the law of the Lord,</HI> which is &s;piritual. Tho&s;e that are exerci|&s;ed in this law of the &s;pirit of life, and walk in obedience to it, no evil nor temptation &s;hall prevail again&s;t; but they will witne&s;s &s;alvation for walls and bulwarks. Some were wit|ne&s;&s;es of old, that <HI>the law of the Lord was pure and perfect.</HI> Ma|ny are witne&s;&s;es of the &s;ame this day, and know it &s;o by the operation of it: and know them&s;elves &s;ubjects of that law, which is &s;piritual within, which judgeth every vain thought, and every idle word, and bringeth down every vain imagi|nation. It is a ble&s;&s;ed &s;tate, to be meditating in this law day and night. For I te&s;tify, that this law of the &s;pirit of life within, was mankind's rule, whereby he walked innocently and uprightly before tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion entered, and before out|ward characters were invented, or before any outward law was written or engraved on tables of &s;tone. To this again are many called, and many are coming, and come; and for|ever ble&s;&s;ed are tho&s;e that walk therein and are ruled thereby.</P>

VI. The <HI>true knowledge of Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> is very precious; to know him as he was before <HI>Abraham</HI> was, and to know the knowledge of him after the fle&s;h pa&s;s away. Such know him to be the tree of life, which grows in the mid&s;t of the garden of God, &s;it under his &s;hadow with great delight, and his fruit is &s;weet to their ta&s;te. They that eat thereof, know that food which the world is ignorant of, and is beyond words. Fruit and eating are more than words. Such are come to wit|ne&s;s the go&s;pel promi&s;es fulfilled, and they need no man to teach them; no man need to &s;ay to his neighbour, <HI>Know the Lord;</HI> for the knowledge of him abounds in their hearts.</P>
<P>That which make the meetings of the righteous to differ from all other meetings in the world, is to feel Je&s;us the Sa|viour in the mid&s;t of them, and to feel their hearts and minds in unity and fellow&s;hip with him. This &s;eeling and knowing, tran&s;cends all words and profe&s;&s;ions; for, for a time Chri&s;t's very di&s;ciples did not &s;o know him, whil&s;t he was with them in that prepared body; therefore a remnant can call that day ble&s;&s;ed, wherein their minds were turned from the darkne&s;s within, to the light within, which reveals and makes Chri&s;t manife&s;t again, as he was with the father before the world began, and as he was before <HI>Abraham</HI> was.</P>
<P N="7">VII. It is now as truly witne&s;&s;ed as it was of old, <HI>That the eye of the Lord runs to and fro through the earth, beholding the evil and the good;</HI> even that eye which &s;earcheth the heart, and trieth the reins, and &s;heweth to man his thoughts. Our hap|pine&s;s con&s;i&s;teth in this, that we have a te&s;timony within our|&s;elves, that our hearts are upright and &s;incere in the &s;ight of this eye. This was it which God had re&s;pect unto in all ages; for when his cho&s;en people the <HI>Jews</HI> degenerated from uprightne&s;s of heart, notwith&s;tanding they kept in the out|ward performances and ob&s;ervations, as keeping <HI>appointed fea&s;ts, new moons, and &s;abbath-days, &s;olemn a&s;&s;emblies, killing, and offering &s;acrifices,</HI> &amp;c. yet all the&s;e things, while their hearts were gone a&s;tray from him, and were not upright and &s;incere in the &s;ight of this eye of the Lord, their performances were not accepted, but were abomination unto him.</P>
<P>It is a precious thing to witne&s;s, that our hearts are up|right in the &s;ight of the Lord, or before his eye, that runs to and fro through the earth; that that &s;in may never overtake us, which overtook the <HI>Jews</HI> of old, <HI>viz. to keep the outward form, and loo&s;e the power.</HI> Our &s;olemn a&s;&s;embling, our form of &s;ound words, and our outward demeanour, which the life of truth led us into at fir&s;t; if we feel not the &s;ame life accom|panying of us, and pre&s;erving us in it, that we may be a
<PB N="15" REF="013006_0029_0F8FAB02F58DA7E0">living people, walking uprightly before the Lord; I &s;ay, without this, all is vain and unprofitable.</P>
<P>It is the hone&s;t and upright heart that is the good ground, where the &s;eed of the kingdom grows and pro&s;pers, and brings forth acceptable fruit.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. It is a very precious thing, to witne&s;s a <HI>true waiting upon the Lord.</HI> Many great and glorious promi&s;es are made to tho&s;e that truly wait upon him. <HI>They that wait upon the Lord &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> want no good thing:</HI> This, to witne&s;s and enjoy, is the &s;ub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ce of all. While we waited upon invented means, men and books, upon our own thoughts and imaginations, our own wi&s;dom and under&s;tanding, we wanted the good things; the&s;e were not &s;ufficient to lead us to the knowledge, nor the enjoyment of them.</P>
<P>Hereby may all <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> &s;o called, be tried and judged, even by this one word; they pretend a wor&s;hipping and wait|ing upon the Lord, but they want the good things, and the evil things abound among&s;t them; &s;o are hereby found fal&s;e witne&s;&s;es, who &s;ay they wait upon the Lord, and he hath not fulfilled his promi&s;es to them. A remanant are at this day true and faithful witne&s;&s;es, that the Lord is faithful, ju&s;t and true to his promi&s;es, and that he hath fitted and furni&s;hed them with the heavenly trea&s;ures, the good things of his kingdom, as they truly wait upon him. This waiting doth not begin when our &s;olemn meetings begin, neither doth it end with them, but remaineth always.</P>
<P N="9">IX. The <HI>Truth</HI> in it&s;elf is very precious, and the revelati|on and knowledge of it in our hearts, is al&s;o very precious. It is in this <HI>Truth,</HI> that God is wor&s;hipped with that wor&s;hip which is more acceptable than all the wor&s;hips in the world, who&s;e wor&s;hippers profe&s;s the <HI>Truth</HI> in words, but know it not, neither are they made free by it; &s;o are found fal&s;e wor&s;hippers and fal&s;e witne&s;&s;es; for the revelation and know|ledge of the <HI>Truth</HI> brings to freedom, freedom from &s;in; gives power over vain thoughts, over pa&s;&s;ions, over the will and in|ordinate affections, and al&s;o removes the ground from whence all evil &s;prings.</P>
<P>The revelation and knowledge of this <HI>Truth,</HI> brings into that righteou&s;ne&s;s which exceeds the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees; it makes clean the in&s;ide. All other knowledge and religion in the world makes clean but the out&s;ide at mo&s;t; but this the in&s;ide, and then the out&s;ide will be clean al&s;o.</P>
<P>Oh! what a lamentation may be taken up for the greater part of mankind, who are not only &s;trangers to the revelation
<PB N="16" REF="013006_0030_0F8FAB052BDF3B50">and powerful operation of the <HI>Truth</HI> in the inward parts, but al&s;o through the wiles of the enemy of their &s;ouls everla&s;ting peace, are begotten into a belief, <HI>That it is impo&s;&s;ible to witne&s;s a clean in&s;ide, and to be delivered from all evil on this &s;ide the grave.</HI> They are ea&s;ily per&s;uaded, that the enemy of their &s;ouls is always near them, ready on the right-hand and on the left, to draw them a&s;ide into the way wherein they ought not to walk; but have no knowledge nor faith in the heavenly <HI>Truth, Virtue</HI> and <HI>Tower</HI> pre&s;eut, which is able to &s;ave out of all temptati|ons, and to deliver out of the &s;nares of &s;atan; and therefore are taken captive at his plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate we our&s;elves were; but now the knowledge of the <HI>Truth</HI> is come, and the powerful operation of it we are witne&s;&s;es of. Let us per&s;evere and walk in the &s;ame, that we may witne&s;s the end of its work, which is to fini&s;h and make an end of &s;in, and bring in everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s. This is the &s;ub&s;tance of all, and the end of the <HI>Truth</HI> revealing it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Now in the pre&s;ent &s;en&s;e and enjoyment of the revelation and knowledge of the powerful operation of the <HI>Truth within,</HI> in our own hearts, we cannot but call to mind the days pa&s;t, in which the Lord waited to be gracious unto us, and follow|ed us with his mercies and with his judgments; often knocked at the door of our hearts, and often appeared unto us, though we knew him not; and his long-&s;uffering was great, wherein he waited to &s;hew him&s;elf kind and gracious unto us, &s;tanding at the door till his locks were wet with the drops of the night, and we let him not in, neither received his kindne&s;s, becau&s;e we neither knew him, nor his love.</P>
<P>But now he hath revealed him&s;elf unto us, he hath opened that eye that can &s;ee him, and our hearts to receive him, and is come to make his abode with us. Oh! Friends, how are we engaged to walk an&s;werable to this great love, which we are made partakers of! Indeed <HI>we love him, becau&s;e he fir&s;t lov|ed us.</HI> We wait upon him, becau&s;e he fir&s;t waited upon us. May not we &s;ay, as &s;ome of old &s;aid, <HI>What manner of love is this, that we &s;hould be called the &s;ons of God, and be inheritors of &s;uch precious promi&s;es,</HI> and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the knowledge of that one everla&s;ting <HI>Truth</HI> which makes free!</P>
<P>But Friends, when the knowledge of this <HI>Truth</HI> is enjoyed, there is a po&s;&s;ibility of lo&s;ing it again; the holy &s;pirit which &s;ealeth and e&s;tabli&s;heth in it, if it be grieved, it will not do its work, and <HI>a vain thought, given place unto, will grieve it; an idle word will grieve it:</HI> Therefore it concerns us all, to wait and watch in that which pre&s;erveth and keepeth out of all evil, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Light</HI> forever.</P>

X. It is a ble&s;&s;ed and happy &s;tate, to have <HI>the te&s;timony with|in our&s;elves,</HI> that our minds are exerci&s;ed in that wherein &s;tands the everla&s;ting univer&s;al wor&s;hip, which is not limited to time nor place.</P>
<P>This wor&s;hip is not like the wor&s;hips which are among the &s;ects in the world, who pretend only to wor&s;hip God in cer|tain places, and at certain times, and think God is plea&s;ed with their pretended &s;erving him one day in &s;even; or one hour in &s;even; though at other times they &s;erve them&s;elves and the evil one, &s;peak their own words, think their own thoughts, and do their own works.</P>
<P>Oh! it is lamentable to behold, when I look over the &s;tate of <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> and &s;ee the apo&s;tacy it is degenerated into, re|taining &s;omething of the form, but denying the power.</P>
<P>Here is our ble&s;&s;edne&s;s and true happine&s;s, that we have our minds exerci&s;ed in the heavenly light that brings to, and pre|&s;erveth in the true everla&s;ting wor&s;hip which is inward, <HI>in the &s;pirit and in the truth;</HI> which all <HI>Temple</HI> and <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> wor&s;hip ontwardly at certain times, and &s;et places, were but a type and figure of. This wor&s;hip <HI>in the &s;pirit and in the truth,</HI> is the antitype, it is the &s;ub&s;tance of all tho&s;e typical, temporary wor&s;hips. Oh! my friends, let none of us be found out of this everla&s;ting univer&s;al wor&s;hip, which doth not begin when we meet together to wait upon the Lord a few hours, to be refre&s;hed together in the &s;en&s;e of his pre&s;ence; neither doth it end when we part.</P>
<P>And friends, this re&s;ts upon my &s;pirit to te&s;tify, That none can enjoy true ble&s;&s;edne&s;s and &s;piritual con&s;olation to their &s;ouls, farther than they have a te&s;timony in them&s;elves, that they walk in the precious everla&s;ting light that now &s;hineth. To this light our minds were at fir&s;t turned, in which God dwells, and in which the wor&s;hip <HI>in &s;pirit and truth</HI> is learned and performed, in this age as in ages pa&s;t. The way is, and hath been throughout all generations, ONE, and it is a plain path-way; the way-faring man, though a fool, cannot err in it.</P>
<P>In this light, many are now witne&s;&s;es that God loved them, even while &s;inners; and that in the days of their darkne&s;s and ignorance he waited upon them, to &s;hew him&s;elf gracious; though then they had no faith in him, no e&s;teem for him, neither could they &s;ee any comline&s;s in him, <HI>his vi&s;age being more marred than any man's.</HI> Thus he appeared, till the light &s;hined out of the darkne&s;s, and gave the knowledge of his glory, which as they walked in, they became living witne&s;&s;es of his power in &s;alvation, redemption and tran&s;lation from

<P N="11">XI. It is a ble&s;&s;ed &s;tate, <HI>always to live in the &s;en&s;e and feeling of that love which fir&s;t vi&s;ited us,</HI> wherein our minds were turned to the light which &s;hined in the darkne&s;s; for we were then darkne&s;s; which light then made manife&s;t and revealed unto us the <HI>Gift of God</HI> given to us, which is compared to a little leaven, to a grain of &s;eed, to a pearl hid in the field. It is precious to know the <HI>Leaven to work,</HI> the <HI>Seed to grow,</HI> the <HI>Field to be purcha&s;ed,</HI> and the <HI>Pearl found, bought and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</HI> This is more than talk and profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Now can many &s;ay, as was witne&s;&s;ed of old, <HI>We are come un|to him as unto a living &s;tone, elect and precious, and we are kept by the power of him unto &s;alvation; and we are in him in whom there is no condemnation:</HI> Thus to road and witne&s;s the &s;criptures, is beyond all the talk and notions that are in the world which lies in wickedne&s;s, where the guilt and condemnation is.</P>
<P>As we continually live in the &s;en&s;e and feeling of that pre|cious love which at fir&s;t &s;ought us out, and pulled &s;ome of us as brands out of the fire, and others as &s;wine wallowing in the mire; as we remain &s;en&s;ible of this love, we &s;hall feel our hearts more and more engaged to walk worthy of it; <HI>and not only profe&s;s grace, but live under it; not only profe&s;s light, but walk in it, that we way be perfect children of it;</HI> for if we live not the life of what we profe&s;s, &s;orer judgments will pur&s;ue us than many others, who are called as we are, but have not ta&s;ted of the heavenly power as we have. Therefore it concerns us to be watchful, and retain our fir&s;t love; for it is po&s;&s;ible, after the hou&s;e <HI>is &s;wept and garni&s;hed, and the unclean &s;pirits ca&s;t forth, that they may return and enter again.</HI> Therefore it is very precious not only to know that ble&s;&s;ed power that ca&s;teth forth the unclean &s;pi|rit, and &s;weepeth and garni&s;heth the hou&s;e with heavenly trea&s;ures; but al&s;o to dwell and abide in the fame, by it to be pre&s;erved from being defiled again. This is the &s;ub&s;tance of the <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion.</HI> This is the end of all mini&s;tring, &s;peak|ing and writing. This is more than hearing ten thou&s;and fer|mons. Let us always remain in the feeling of, and obedience to this power, and we &s;hall never fall.</P>
<P N="12">XII. It is more than words can expre&s;s, <HI>to feel and enjoy that wherein the kingdom of Heaven &s;tands.</HI> It is written in the ho|ly &s;criptures, <HI>That the kingdom of Heaven &s;tands not in meats and
<PB N="19" REF="013006_0033_0F8FAB0735C9E5C0">drinks, and outward wa&s;hings; but in the power and joy of the holy &s;pirit.</HI> To enjoy this, is the &s;ub&s;tance of all; but none come to receive the joy of the holy &s;pirit, but &s;uch only who are kept by the power in which the kingdom &s;tands; which power pre&s;erveth from evil, and keepeth from falling into temptation. Many may come to the knowledge of this power, and may profe&s;s it, and have &s;ome faith in it; which is beyond all notional &s;ectarians in <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> yet if they live not obedient to it, and witne&s;s a being kept by it to the end, they come not to be children of this kingdom, nor to &s;it down in it, nor enjoy the comfort and plea&s;ures thereof.</P>
<P>The bare profe&s;&s;ion and knowledge of the power is little worth, but a being pre&s;erved by it; for if any enter into evil and temptation, &s;uch grieve the holy &s;pirit, &s;o cannot have the joy of it, wherein the kingdom &s;tands. This is that which chiefly di&s;tingui&s;heth us from the divers &s;ects in <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> a being <HI>pre&s;erved in the power,</HI> and not <HI>a talking of it only.</HI> It is written in the holy &s;criptures of truth, that Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the &s;econd <HI>Adam,</HI> when he was tempted by the devil with &s;ore and grievous temptations, <HI>eat nothing,</HI> but by the power of his Fa|ther that dwelt in him, with&s;tood the devil and all his temp|tations; and when he departed from him, <HI>angels mini&s;tred unto him.</HI> The &s;ame power which pre&s;erveth in temptations, and keepeth from eating or receiving the bait of the enemy or tempter, are we all to witne&s;s in the time of trial and hour of temptation.</P>
<P>It was the fir&s;t <HI>Adam</HI> that eat when he was tempted. Now his eating implies a taking or letting in &s;omething; a giving place to the devil's bait, whereby the temptation entered. He did not &s;tand in the power wherein the heavenly kingdom &s;tands, which is able to pre&s;erve, as did the &s;econd <HI>Adam:</HI> So departing from this, he lo&s;t the joy of the holy &s;pirt, which the kingdom &s;tands in; as all the children of the fir&s;t <HI>Adam</HI> do, who have not faith in that power that &s;aveth out of temp|tation.</P>
<P>This is the &s;ub&s;tance of the <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion;</HI> which we are called to the profe&s;&s;ion and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, viz. <HI>The power and joy of the holy &s;pirit, in which the kingdom &s;tands;</HI> which power &s;trikes at the root of all the wickedne&s;s and evil in the world, and is the ax that is laid to the root of the evil tree, which has grown up in the apo&s;tacy. This is that by which <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> mu&s;t be reformed. No &s;ound reformation but by this in the particular, and in the general.</P>
<P>Friends are witne&s;&s;es, and many could &s;eal it with their lives, that there is no other way nor means appointed of
<PB N="20" REF="013006_0034_0F8FAB07F4C24960">God, to come to &s;it down in the kingdom of Heaven, nor to attain everla&s;ting &s;alvation, but by believing in the power of God, in the light of Chri&s;t <HI>within,</HI> to which our minds have been directed. Indeed, among the many &s;ects in <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> there are divers other means <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d ways invented and &s;et up; but we know them all to be vanity. We have tried and prov|ed them, and know there is nothing of worth in them. We are now come to the true and living way, the ancient path, in which the righteous in all ages ever walked. Now this remains, that we always feel our hearts engaged to walk in this way, and to keep &s;en&s;ible of that power which &s;aveth from evil, that we may adorn our profe&s;&s;ion; for if any, that pro|fe&s;s this everla&s;ting way, enter into temptation, or commit evil, they do not adorn their profe&s;&s;ion, but are a &s;candal to it, and lay a &s;tumbling-block in the way of others, who are where we were, when wandering in de&s;olate places, and tra|velling in the de&s;art howling wilderne&s;s. The day of &s;uch will be turned into darkne&s;s, and the cur&s;e due to him that lays a &s;tumbling-block in the way of the blind, and that lead|eth him out of his way, will fall upon him.</P>
<P>Therefore it concerns all to be watchful, and per&s;evere in that which is good, to be as lights of the world, and as the &s;alt of the earth indeed; that we may never leave &s;hining, nor lo&s;e our &s;avour. What&s;oever was written aforetime, was written for our learning; and it is profitable to meditate and con&s;ider, that many in former ages had much experience of the power and pre&s;ence of the Lord, &s;aw many of his won|drous works, and travelled through the red &s;ea and wilder|ne&s;s, to the borders of the promi&s;ed land; yet through mur|mering and di&s;obedience, entered not therein, nor did enjoy the end of the Lord in bringing them out of <HI>Egypt</HI>'s land. And many may in this age fall &s;hort as they did, if we walk not clo&s;e with the Lord, and learn by what is written to take warning, le&s;t by di&s;obedience and unbelief, we fall &s;hort of receiving the great recompence of reward.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. The <HI>Bread of the kingdom,</HI> is the joy of the holy &s;pi|rit felt and known <HI>within,</HI> which &s;atisfieth and refre&s;heth the &s;oul.

The table, in the outward temple of the Lord, was furni&s;hed with outward bread: As we witne&s;s our bodies the temple of the Lord, we &s;hall enjoy this bread, which that was but the type and &s;hadow of.

XIV. Many are living witne&s;&s;es in this day, as of old, <HI>That the foundation of God &s;tands &s;ure;</HI> and that this foundation, as now made manife&s;t, was the foundation of the righteous in all ages; that the light, grace and &s;pirit of God within, which mixeth, not with vain thoughts and evil imaginations, but di&s;covers them and judgeth them, is this foundation. This is the &s;tone the builders in their natural wi&s;dom reject and de&s;pi&s;e, and cry up other &s;tones, and invent other foundations, according to the imaginations of their own hearts.</P>
<P>Now it is a ble&s;&s;ed thing, and the duty of every particular, to witne&s;s them&s;elves living &s;tones, built upon this foundation, and to have their hearts and minds united to it, and framed with it.</P>
<P N="15">XV. The &s;ame grace, the &s;ame anointing, <HI>which was the &s;aints teacher in the primitive times,</HI> is revealed and witne&s;&s;ed in this our day and time. It is a ble&s;&s;ed thing always to learn of him; for many that have come to the revelation of this teacher, not waiting low in that which did reveal him, that &s;elf might be made of no reputation, and the will and &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit brought down, have been deceived, and have learned of the fal&s;e teacher, the Antichri&s;t, in&s;tead of the true, yet under the name of the true; this hath happened in &s;ome among our&s;elves, &s;ince we were a people; for this know, that no people ever wor&s;hipped the whore the mother of harlots, the bea&s;t, fal&s;e prophet and Antichri&s;t, under tho&s;e names and denominations; but being deceived, gave them good names, and believed her to be the true woman, the lamb's wife, the true prophet, and the true Chri&s;t. This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ath been the &s;tate of all the Apo&s;tates in <HI>Chri&s;tendom;</HI> for as the my&s;tery of godline&s;s is great; &s;o is the my&s;tery of iniquity great al&s;o; and there is none but tho&s;e that come truly to learn of the grace of God, the anointing within, that are able to di&s;cern between the one and the other.</P>
<P>Therefore it is precious always to learn of the grace and anointing, and to walk in the light which our minds were at fir&s;t directed to; this reveals the deep things of God, and finds out the hidden things of <HI>E&s;au.</HI></P>
<P>The very remembrance of the time wherein our minds were turned from the ways, inventions and teaching of men <HI>without,</HI> to the light, grace and anointing <HI>within,</HI> is very precious; for hereby we are made partakers of a mea&s;ure of the &s;ame wi&s;|dom and revelation, which <HI>John</HI> wrote his book of the Revela|tions in. The &s;ame &s;pirit which he was led by, to give names to things, according to their nature, and not according to their appearance, is now again witne&s;&s;ed. The great whore, the
<PB N="22" REF="013006_0036_0F8FAB0973C4F9B8">mother of harlots, the bea&s;t and fal&s;e prophet, and the golden cup that is held forth to the nations, the Antichri&s;t in the temple, and the great red dragon that <HI>John</HI> &s;aw in Heaven, by the &s;ame &s;pirit are now revealed and judged; and as we keep our hearts and ears open to this teacher, we can never be de|ceived by them again.</P>
<P>All the nominal profe&s;&s;ors and &s;ects in <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> who learn not of this teacher, are &s;o far deceived, that they believe the whore is the Lamb's wife, and her golden cup, the cup of ble&s;&s;ings, and &s;o are greedily drinking of it; not di&s;cerning the fal&s;e prophet and Antichri&s;t from the true, becau&s;e he get into the temple of God, and cloaths him&s;elf like unto an an|gel of light, and like unto the true Chri&s;t: Such take the great red dragon, that appears in Heaven, to be the Lamb of God.</P>
<P>Therefore it is a ble&s;&s;ed thing, always to keep our minds &s;tayed, and our feet walking in the heavenly light that now &s;hineth, which reveals the true teacher, that teacheth and di&s;eovers all things, and gives to &s;ee to the ground and foun|dation of things; to di&s;cern &s;pirits; and keep out of that wherein the my&s;tery of iniquity prevails.</P>
<P>All the teachings of men and books in the world, are but dro&s;s and dung in compari&s;on of this divine teacher the <HI>Light, Spirit</HI> and <HI>Grace of God within.</HI> This was man's teacher and guide before books were written; before an outward law was written; and this I te&s;tify, in the word of the Lord, that the teachings of all men, books and writings, which tend to divert the mind of mankind from this divine teacher within, are vain and unprofitable, and proceed from that wi&s;dom which is earth|ly, &s;enfual and devili&s;h; and all that lend an ear unto it, are captivated in the my&s;tery of iniquity; ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth which makes free, &s;o long as they abide under &s;uch teachers.</P>
<P>Many are living witne&s;&s;es, that as they gave up to be taught, and led by the true teacher, the anointing within, they &s;oon became wi&s;er than all their former teachers</P>
<P N="16">XVI. The &s;ame everla&s;ting power, which pre&s;erved the righteous in all ages pa&s;t out of evil, and from falling into temptations, is <HI>now revealed and witne&s;&s;ed in this our day and age;</HI> even the &s;ame power and arm of &s;alvation that pre&s;erved <HI>Jo|&s;eph</HI> in <HI>Egypt, Job</HI> in all his trials and temptations, <HI>Daniel</HI> and the three children, and all the primitive prophets and <HI>Chri&s;ti|ans,</HI> out of all the fiery trials, a&s;&s;aults and buffetings of &s;atan they met withal.</P>
<P>Therefore it is a ble&s;&s;ed thing to be truly acquainted with
<PB N="23" REF="013006_0037_0F8FAB0B977DF638">this power, and always to live in the &s;en&s;e of it; for it is po&s;&s;ible that people may come to the knowledge of this power, and make a profe&s;&s;ion of it, and witne&s;s &s;alvation and redemp|tion by it, in a great mea&s;ure, yet if they wait not low in their minds, till it has fully wrought the work of &s;alvation and redemption in them, or wholly brought every thought and imagination into the obedience of Chri&s;t, &s;ubdued their own wills and &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit, and know &s;elf made of no reputa|tion and nailed to the cro&s;s; I &s;ay, without this, they may fall into the &s;nare of the devil again, be captivated and led into temptation again: For it is about &s;uch, the tempter and de&s;troyer goes like a roaring lion &s;eeking to devour, even tho&s;e, out of whom he hath been ca&s;t and di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. It is written, <HI>He rules in the hearts of the children of di&s;obedience.</HI> He needs not go about &s;uch, being got within them; there he is in his throne.</P>
<P>But it is about the righteous, out of whom he hath been ea&s;t, <HI>be goeth,</HI> who are redeemed from under his power, and tran&s;lated out of his kingdom; it is again&s;t &s;uch he appears not only like a roaring lion, but as a &s;ubtle &s;erpent, and angel of light.</P>
<P>Therefore it is a ble&s;&s;ed thing, always to live in the &s;en&s;e, knowledge and feeling of this ancient power, which alone &s;a|veth and delivereth in the mid&s;t of all trials and be&s;etments of the evil one; as the eye of the mind and under&s;tanding is fix|ed upon it, no temptation can prevail; and to know thy faith increa&s;ed in it; for faith in this power of God is compared to a &s;hield, which is able to quench all the fiery darts of the devil, and to give victory over him.</P>
<P>Now that which was our mi&s;ery and lo&s;s in the time of our ignorance and darkne&s;s, is the mi&s;ery and lo&s;s of mankind in their unregenerate &s;tate. We had no faith in the &s;pirit of God, which convinceth the world of &s;in. We did not believe, that the &s;ame hand of power that &s;mote us for &s;in and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, was able and &s;ufficient to heal us; neither did we regard the &s;trivings of God's &s;pirit within; neither did we give heed to him that &s;tood at the door of our hearts and knocked, who long waited to &s;hew him&s;elf gracious unto us; and was as a light &s;hining in darkne&s;s, but we regarded it not, and &s;o did not know the virtue and powerful operation of it. In this unbelieving di&s;obedient &s;tate, we were children of wrath as well as others, but having obtained mercy to be faith|ful, we have now, in the &s;tate above, left all the world cap|tivated, by rea&s;on of their unbelief and hardne&s;s of heart.</P>
<P>And herein is the love, exceeding kindne&s;s and mercy of
<PB N="24" REF="013006_0038_0F8FAB0C73EC34B0">God manife&s;t, in that he loved us, while we were enemies; and waited to &s;hew him&s;elf gracious, while we were &s;inners; to be reconciled unto us, when we were in rebellion again&s;t him; and enlightned us, when we were darkne&s;s; and often called, when we were running from him; and was near and ready to teach us, when we were ignorant and did not de&s;ire the knowledge of his ways. In this was the exceeding love of God manife&s;t to us then, and is the &s;ame to all the world now. His love is univer&s;al to all, as is te&s;tified in the holy &s;criptures; <HI>God &s;o loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son a light in|to the world, that who&s;oever believeth in him &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life.</HI></P>
<P>It is very precious to walk in this light, which doth reveal the love and kindne&s;s of God, and brings to the knowledge and experience of the means of &s;alvation which he hath ap|pointed; and to the feeling of that power which &s;aveth from falling into temptation, even the &s;ame power which pre&s;erved Je&s;us when he was tempted in the wilderne&s;s. Now if any that are come to the knowledge and profe&s;&s;ion of this power, are not pre&s;erved by it from falling into temptation, and de|livered from evil, &s;uch are not obedient nor faithful to it, &s;o do not adorn their profe&s;&s;ion; <HI>Such do not glorify the power, but are as &s;pots in our fea&s;ts, and a &s;candal to the go&s;pel of peace, and enemies to the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, which is the power of God to &s;alvation.</HI></P>
<P>Now tho&s;e that live in, and are obedient to this power, are the wi&s;e&s;t, happie&s;t and &s;afe&s;t people in the world; ble&s;&s;ed above all the families of the earth. Ble&s;&s;ed with an hundred fold in this world, and in the world to come, life everla&s;ting. Such are as the &s;alt of the earth which &s;ea&s;oneth all things, as a city on a hill which cannot be hid, and as the lights of the world indeed.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. Many are living witne&s;&s;es, that <HI>the law of the &s;pirit of life,</HI> unto which their minds have been directed, <HI>is pure and perfect.</HI> They witne&s;s it &s;o by its operation in them, by which every appearance of evil is condemned.</P>
<P>It is the happine&s;s of every particular, to have the witne&s;s or te&s;timony within them&s;elves, that they love this law, and that they meditate in it day and night. <HI>Oh!</HI> &s;aid one of old, <HI>how I love thy law!</HI> It is only tho&s;e that love it, that are true witne&s;&s;es of its purity and perfection; for it is po&s;&s;ible, that a per&s;on or people may not only profe&s;s and talk of this law, but come to &s;ome knowledge of it al&s;o, and yet not love it, nor meditate in it, nor feel the power and peace of it.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that love the law of God, are converted, and made wi&s;e unto &s;alvation by it; and though their enemies are very
<PB N="25" REF="013006_0039_0F8FAB0D972F5550">many, and very night al&s;o, yet they cannot prevail again&s;t them that love this law, They are the happie&s;t people of all the fa|milies of the earth. No evil prevails again&s;t &s;uch; and as it hath been witne&s;&s;ed of old, <HI>viz. Great peace have tho&s;e that love thy law.</HI> So tho&s;e are living witne&s;&s;es of the &s;ame <HI>great peace</HI> in this age, who love the law, which is light. <HI>Thy law is light,</HI> &s;aid one. He that loves the light, brings his deeds unto it, by it to be tried and judged; and after this, the <HI>great peace</HI> is wit|ne&s;&s;ed. Peace is the reward of tho&s;e that love the law of God; peace in the inward parts, even the peace of God, which the world cannot give nor take away.</P>
<P>This one word or &s;entence may try all the &s;ects in <HI>Chri&s;ten|dom,</HI> and others who profe&s;s them&s;elves lovers of the law of God, yet have not peace in their dwellings; the&s;e have not the an&s;wer of a good con&s;cience, which keeps void of offence to|wards God and man; have not that peace which pa&s;&s;eth the under&s;tanding of man in the fall; know not their hearts and minds kept by it; but are found in the evil-doing, where the tribulation and angui&s;h is, and in that fear which brings tor|ment. <HI>So where the doing of evil is, the law is not loved.</HI> Let thy talk and profe&s;&s;ion be what it will, what is written is infalli|bly true, <HI>He that doth evil hates the light;</HI> and he that hates the light is wicked, to whom there is no peace; the law being no light to his feet, nor lanthorn to his path. He walks in dark|ne&s;s and &s;tumbles, and knows not at what; and in the end lies down in &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Therefore it is very good for every particular, not only to know the law of God, but al&s;o to live in the &s;en&s;e and love of this law at all times; when they are about their common oc|ca&s;ions in the world, as well as in their &s;olemn a&s;&s;emblings be|fore the Lord. The love of this pure law of the &s;pirit of life, which judgeth every appearance of evil, makes wi&s;e unto &s;al|vation, wi&s;er than all former teachers; and to hear, love and obey his law, or word in the heart, is the end of all words, outward di&s;pen&s;ations and mini&s;trations, though proceeding from the power of God it&s;elf: For had not mankind degene|rated from the love and obedience of this law or command of God, tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion had never entered, neither had &s;in had a being in the heart of man, neither had an outward law been added or given forth; <HI>that being added becau&s;e of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and hath power over the tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, &s;o long as he liveth di&s;obedient, and a &s;tranger to the law written in the table of the heart by the finger of God;</HI> which was before an outward law was written either
<PB N="26" REF="013006_0040_0F8FAB0E0253B7E8">in a book or on tables of &s;tone, and before the cau&s;e of it was brought forth into the world.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. The <HI>day-&s;pring</HI> from on high, and the <HI>everla&s;ting light</HI> hath and doth &s;hine out of darkne&s;s in the hearts of many in this age; and they are, by the heavenly &s;hining thereof, come to the knowledge of the field where the trea&s;ure is hid, and to the &s;ight of that who&s;e worth and beauty tran&s;cends all the trea&s;ures and plea&s;ures this world can afford.

<P>All the &s;ects in <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> who believe not in the light within, and de&s;pi&s;e the day of its appearance within them|&s;elves, are &s;o far from enjoying this heavenly trea&s;ure, that they are wholly ignorant of the place or field wherein it is hid.</P>
<P>This is &s;ealed in the hearts of a remnant, that there is no other way, no other means, no other key to be found to open the heavenly my&s;teries, nor to unloo&s;e the &s;eals thereof, and to lead into the enjoyment of the heavenly trea&s;ure, but the holy divine light, which in their hearts hath appeared and &s;hined gloriou&s;ly, to the di&s;covery and de&s;truction of the man of &s;in and my&s;tery of iniquity, which once wrought and ru|led therein. In this light they have believed and walked, and &s;een the wonderous works of the Lord in the deep, while the people and nations, that de&s;pi&s;e and hate it, walk and dwell in darkne&s;s, and in the region and &s;hadow of death, where the poverty, woe and mi&s;ery is; where the &s;tumbling, grop|ing, falling, and wandering in de&s;olate places is; where the labouring for vanity, and lying down in &s;orrow is; therefore are the hearts of &s;uch greatly engaged unto the Lord, to walk worthy of the riches of his grace, light and heavenly trea&s;ure, he hath made them partakers of.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. The light of the glorious go&s;pel <HI>now &s;hineth;</HI> the day of &s;alvation <HI>is come,</HI> even the &s;alvation of God, which he hath prepared before the &s;ace of all people.</P>
<P>This is the day of great &s;alvation, which many righteous men and prophets &s;aw afar off, and prophe&s;ied of, that is now revealed unto us. It is a ble&s;&s;ed thing, not only to know the appearance of the day of &s;alvation, but to know the joy of it, the joy of God's &s;alvation; and to know it as walls and bul|warks, to &s;ave and defend not only from the be&s;ieger without, but from the enemy within al&s;o.</P>
<P>This is the glorious light of the go&s;pel, that &s;hineth in this day of &s;alvation now revealed, which as we walk and abide in, we &s;hall be as &s;trong as an army with banners, and witne&s;s

<P>This is my te&s;timony, That none can receive the joy of God's &s;alvation, enter into the &s;abbath of re&s;t, or keep holy-day to the Lord, further than they know a cea&s;ing, and a being &s;aved from thinking their own thoughts, following their own wills, and obeying their own wi&s;dom; for the &s;elfi&s;h thoughts that ari&s;e within, are the root of evil, and as the foundation of the kingdom of darkne&s;s; and the light of this day of &s;alva|tion, is as the ax laid to the root of the evil tree.</P>
<P>So it is a ble&s;&s;ed thing for people to meet and wait together, and walk together in this heavenly light and day of &s;alvation, which di&s;covereth and judgeth every vain thought and fooli&s;h imagination, &s;ubdueth them, and bringeth them down into the obedience of Chri&s;t. In this, as they walk and abide, they truly differ from all other families of the earth; for in this heavenly <HI>go&s;pel light,</HI> which judgeth every appearance of evil, &s;tands the true fellow&s;hip and true unity. It is the foundation of that church, again&s;t which the gates of hell &s;hall never pre|vail; as they walk and dwell therein, the power of death and hell &s;hall never break them, but they &s;hall remain as Mount <HI>Sion,</HI> which can never be removed. In this &s;tands their hap|pine&s;s and &s;afety: Out of this they are as weak as other people.</P>
<P N="20">XX. It is a ble&s;&s;ed thing, to wait for <HI>the appearance of him</HI> who is the con&s;olation of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and for <HI>the coming of his king|dom;</HI> but it is more ble&s;&s;ed to be witne&s;&s;es of his appearance, and to know his kingdom come; and mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed of all, to know a &s;itting down in it with him, in the glory of his father, and our father, his God and our God.</P>
<P N="21">XXI.

<P>And under them all, he is to be carefully minded and re|garded, though it be in his fir&s;t or lowe&s;t appearance, which is to convince of &s;in, &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s and judgment; in order to de&s;troy fin, fini&s;h tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and bring in everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s. Except people abide with him, and love his appearance in the mini&s;tration of condemnation, which brings tribulation and angui&s;h upon the &s;oul that hath &s;inned, they can never come to enjoy and inherit the mini&s;tration of life and &s;alvation, nor never come to enjoy the glory of his ap|pearance the &s;econd time, without &s;in unto &s;alvation.</P>
<P>This is the lo&s;s and mi&s;ery of mankind, and was our lo&s;s and mi&s;ery in the day of our ignorance, that they know not how to wait for the appearance of Chri&s;t, or the coming of the ju&s;t one; neither do they, nor did we, know him when he did appear, for he often appeared unto us, and &s;tood at the door of our hearts, and knocked, and waited to &s;hew him|&s;elf gracious unto us; but we not knowing it was he, did not regard him, nor open unto him; yet he was indeed the de&s;ire of our hearts, and him whom we longed to enjoy, and is the de&s;ire of all nations, the light and &s;alvation of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> the con&s;olation and glory of <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> but in this was our lo&s;s and mi&s;ery, that we knew not how to wait for his appearance, neither did we know him when he did appear. So I &s;ay again, It is a ble&s;&s;ed thing, for a people to know how to wait for the appearance of Je&s;us, the Saviour, and to know him when he doth appear.</P>
<P>But behold, this is a greater degree of ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, To be witne&s;&s;es of his appearance, and to know the <HI>coming of the ju&s;t One,</HI> or the <HI>Ri&s;ing of the Sun of righteou&s;ne&s;s, with healing under his wings,</HI> and to be able to &s;ay, with the primitive <HI>Chri&s;tians, We know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an under|&s;tanding, whereby we may know him that is true, and are in him that is true, even in his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t; this is the true God and eternal life.</HI> This is an high and heavenly knowledge, and a ble&s;&s;ed &s;tate. This the mark and prize of the high calling of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, we have been called unto; and this is the &s;tate all are to wait for, inherit and po&s;&s;e&s;s, and not &s;it down &s;hort of it. If this be not witne&s;&s;ed and enjoyed, all profe&s;&s;ion is vain, all knowledge is vain, all religion and talk of <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> is vain and of no worth; for it is he that believes that Chri&s;t is come <HI>in the fle&s;h,</HI> and that demon&s;trates the livingne&s;s

<P N="22">XXII.

The dark thoughts and imaginations of men, are the grounds of the imagery upon the face of the earth; and that power that breaks them down, and brings every thought into the obedience of Chri&s;t, is the antitype of that &s;tone, and its work revealed to <HI>Daniel,</HI> and dreamed of by the King. In this day of light and knowledge, &s;ome are come to witne&s;s this little &s;tone become a great mountain, and to fill the earth, and to be the chief foundation, and corner|&s;tone elect and precious; the rock and hiding place of the righteous in this, and all ages.

<P N="23">XXIII. This I te&s;tify, That the way of life and everla&s;ting happine&s;s, the way that brings to the &s;itting down in the king|dom of God with <HI>Abraham, I&s;aac and Jacob,</HI> which was the way of the righteous in all ages, <HI>is now again revealed and made known.</HI> This way is the true everla&s;ting light that now &s;hineth, not only in darkne&s;s but out of it; which light is the thing our minds were at fir&s;t turned to, which judgeth every appearance of evil, every vain thought and evil motion that ari&s;eth within; and as there is a walking in this way, a &s;it|ting down in the kingdom will be experienced: For we have been and are called to inherit &s;ub&s;tance, to po&s;&s;e&s;s life, and to &s;it down with Chri&s;t in heavenly places.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="013006_0044_0F8FAB13D3A217B0">
So it is a precious thing, for all that know this way to per|&s;evere in it, till they po&s;&s;e&s;s the&s;e things, and in the &s;ame abide; which way is the light of Chri&s;t within, and there is not another; and the walking in this way di&s;tingui&s;hes them from all the nominal profe&s;&s;ors upon the face of the earth, even this light that judgeth every appearance of evil.</P>
<P>It is a precious &s;tate, to feel the mind &s;tayed upon the Lord, walking in his way; to know the girdle and bridle of <HI>Truth,</HI> and a being girded and bridled with it; to know every high thought and imagination brought down and &s;ubjected unto Chri&s;t <HI>the light, the way.</HI> This is po&s;&s;ible to be known now, as in time pa&s;t.

<P>This light is the one everla&s;ting way, that leads unto him that fits and prepares to enter the kingdom of Heaven, gives free acce&s;s to God, and the throne of his grace, and pre&s;ents unto him without &s;pot or wrinkle.

<P>The &s;pirit of truth, which convinceth the world of &s;in, is that wherein the univer&s;al wor&s;hip of God &s;tands, and is per|formed. This I te&s;tify of it, That there is power and &s;uffi|ciency in it, not only to convince of &s;in, reprove and con|demn for &s;in, but al&s;o to convert, change, clean&s;e, and redeem the whole world of mankind from &s;in, if they would believe in it, love it, receive it and obey it. <HI>This is the condemnation of the world, that light is come into it, and they love darkne&s;s rather,</HI> and will not bring their deeds to the light, love, believe nor

It is very precious to be found in the true di&s;ciples &s;tate, waiting for the comfort and leading of the &s;pirit of truth, and witne&s;&s;ing the &s;ame within them&s;elves. A remnant in this day, who have received this &s;pirit, and followed the leadings of it, are able to &s;ay as &s;ome of old did, <HI>We are not come to Mount</HI> Sinai, <HI>where the voice of words is heard, where the thunderings, lightnings, and earthquakes are,</HI> but to <HI>Mount</HI> Sion, <HI>the city of the living God, the heavenly</HI> Jeru&s;alem; and to <HI>an innumerable company of angels;</HI> to the <HI>general a&s;&s;embly and church of the fir&s;t-born, which are written in Heaven,</HI> and to <HI>God the judge of all;</HI> to the <HI>&s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect;</HI> to <HI>Je&s;us the mediator of the new covenant,</HI> and to <HI>the blood of &s;prinkling, that &s;peaketh better things than that of</HI> Abel.

Certainly it was the joy and delight of the righte|ous in all ages, to draw <HI>nigh unto t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Lord with their hearts;</HI> to be <HI>inward with him in their minds;</HI> and it is the joy and delight of the righteous in this age, who, by drawing nigh unto the Lord, experience the truth of that te&s;timony, <HI>Tho&s;e that draw nigh unto the Lord, the Lord will draw nigh unto them,</HI> and are witne&s;&s;es of his heavenly pre&s;ence, and partake of the joy of his &s;alva|tion, having their conver&s;ation in Heaven, where God dwel|leth; and walk with him as <HI>Enoch, A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">raham, Mo&s;es,</HI> and the Prophets did. This is witne&s;&s;ed by a remnant in this age, as in ages pa&s;t; for the day of life and &s;alvation is come, and the ble&s;&s;ed way that leadeth thereto is known, and evidently made manife&s;t to thou&s;ands in this our own native country, and i&s;land of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> on whom the glory of the Lord is ri&s;en.</P>
<P>It is a ble&s;&s;ed thing to know the way of life and &s;alvation, but it is more ble&s;&s;ed, and a greater degree of happine&s;s, for every particular, to whom it hath appeared, to know them|&s;elves fitted and prepared, by walking in the light thereof, <HI>to po&s;&s;e&s;s and inherit the &s;ame.</HI> This is that which is worthy to be
<PB N="51" REF="013006_0065_0F8FAB2835FD5D88">waited for, and is the ble&s;&s;ed end of all holy writing, reading, preaching and believing, even to po&s;&s;e&s;s the thing read, writ and preached of. Such as are taught of the Lord, and e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in righteou&s;ne&s;s, not only know it, and profe&s;s it, but are e&s;tabli&s;hed in it. This is the mark of the high calling, which all that are but in the way that leadeth thereto, are to pre&s;s after, that they may come to the enjoyment thereof.</P>
<P>It is the ta&s;ting and &s;eeing how good the Lord is, that rai&s;eth and quickeneth de&s;ires to enjoy him, and more and more enga|geth to draw nigh unto him, and to wait upon him. It is the ta&s;ting of the &s;treams of the river of life and plea&s;ure that is at the right-hand of God, that alone reneweth &s;trength; and &s;uch only are witne&s;&s;es of the truth of that &s;aying, <HI>They that wait upon the Lord &s;hall renew their &s;trength, and mount upward as upon the wings of an eagle, run without wearine&s;s, and walk without fainting,</HI> even in the way of God's commandments with delight; being become more natural and plea&s;ant &s;o to do, than ever it was to do the contrary.</P>
<P>This is the ble&s;&s;ed &s;tate and priviledge of many, to draw &s;o nigh unto the Lord, as that they not only ta&s;te and &s;ee the goodne&s;s of the Lord, but are al&s;o filled and &s;atisfied with the renewings of &s;trength, divine refre&s;hments, and heavenly con|&s;olation in their &s;ouls, whereby they are made more and more in love with him, and engaged continually to wait upon him. And in this &s;tands the happine&s;s and pre&s;ervation of all, even as the eye of their minds is kept looking unto the Lord, and waiting upon him, even as the eye of a maid is upon the hand of her mi&s;tre&s;s, and much more. Where this ta&s;ting, &s;eeing, drawing and waiting is wanting, weakne&s;s, wearine&s;s and fainting abounds, and the enemy of their &s;oul prevails, let the talk and profe&s;&s;ion of religion be what it will.</P>
<P N="50">L. It is a ble&s;&s;ing, yea, the ble&s;&s;ing of all ble&s;&s;ings, for eve|ry particular to know and feel within them&s;elves, that <HI>the &s;pirit of God hears witne&s;s with their &s;pirits,</HI> that <HI>they are the &s;ons and daughters of God,</HI> that <HI>they are begotten by him to a lively hope;</HI> whereby <HI>they purify them&s;elves even as he is pure,</HI> and that they are <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> indeed, <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> indeed, in whom is no guile. This I &s;ay is the ble&s;&s;ing of all ble&s;&s;ings, for every one to have the &s;pirit of God to witne&s;s tho&s;e things unto them; and this is precious to wait for and enjoy; for he that hath called us is holy, harmle&s;s and without guile; &s;o as we follow and obey him, we &s;hall be like him, as the primitive <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> were, who &s;aid, <HI>We know that when be doth appear we &s;hall be like him.</HI> This te&s;timony of the &s;pirit of God is more than a

<P>It is good to mind the &s;pirit and its te&s;timony, &s;o as to be|come &s;piritually-minded; then life and peace is known, and death and trouble vani&s;heth away, and the truth of that &s;ay|ing is witne&s;&s;ed, <HI>To be &s;piritually-minded is life and peace, but to be carnally-minded is death.</HI></P>
<P>Of a truth, the &s;pirit of grace and truth is come, and many are living witne&s;&s;es of its appearance and power, not only to reprove and convince, but to comfort and con&s;olate tho&s;e that have and do wait for its appearance, and are in love there with, and have their ear open to its teaching, and their minds and hearts exerci&s;ed in it. In this &s;tands the everla&s;ting joy, peace, comfort and con&s;olation of the righteous, even as they continually learn of the &s;pirit of grace, and are witne&s;&s;es of the leading of it, and guidance of it, out of all evil into all good. As they keep in the &s;en&s;e and exerci&s;e of this &s;pirit of grace, they excel all the bare profe&s;&s;ors in <HI>Chri&s;tendom.</HI> This alone makes them differ from them, even as they grow in &s;pirit, from one degree of grace unto another, from knowledge to knowledge, from faith to faith, from &s;trength to &s;trength, from children to young men, from young men to elders and fathers, even to the &s;tature and fulne&s;s of Chri&s;t, having his mind; <HI>doing always that which plea&s;eth God.</HI> Such are &s;ons of God with|out rebuke, and are able to &s;ay, as &s;ome of old did, <HI>viz.

<P>This is that which keeps us a living virtuous people, even as we abide in him, increa&s;e and grow in him, who at fir&s;t ap|peared unto us, and unto whom our minds were at fir&s;t di|rected. Herein we &s;hall be preachers of righteou&s;ne&s;s, lights of the world, and as the &s;alt of the earth indeed.</P>
<P N="51">LI. It is a precious thing to <HI>wait, walk, and dwell in the light,</HI> even in that which makes all things manife&s;t; and tho&s;e that wait and walk in it, are led by it to the ri&s;ing of the Son, even the everla&s;ting Son of righteou&s;ne&s;s, who&s;e glory, light and virtue, doth as really di&s;per&s;e and drive away the vain thoughts, dark imaginations, fogs, clouds and mi&s;ts of igno|rance and darkne&s;s within, as the outward &s;un doth expel, ex|tingui&s;h,

<P>The very remembrance of the fir&s;t di&s;covery of truth under this name <HI>Light,</HI> in this our age, is very precious. The truth is but one, but it hath many names; and this name <HI>Light,</HI> to a remnant, is very excellent. Many righteous men and Pro|phets, in former ages, foretold of the glory of this day, or <HI>Light</HI> that now &s;hineth, and prophe&s;ied of its-breaking forth unto a people that &s;at in darkne&s;s, and that were covered with the &s;hadow of the night, and dwelt in the region of death. We &s;ee the fulfilling of the&s;e things; for we &s;at in darkne&s;s, and wandered in de&s;olate places, and were encompa&s;&s;ed with the region and &s;hadow of death. Oh! how &s;weet was the light when it fir&s;t &s;prang unto us, and cau&s;ed us to &s;ee over the tops of the high mountains of darkne&s;s, and di&s;covered unto us the &s;ecret chambers of imagery, and the hidden things of darkne&s;s, and guided our feet out of the mine and clay, and &s;et them at liberty, to walk in that path which leadeth out of the way of death and darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>This is that manife&s;tation of light, by which all the&s;e things are effected, to which our minds were at fir&s;t turned; which light judgeth every appearance of evil, and leadeth all, that walk in it, out the &s;ame. This is the path-way, that not on|ly leadeth into innocency, but pre&s;erveth in it; for there is a po&s;&s;ibility in this age as of old, that people may lo&s;e a good &s;tate, be tempted out of innocency and a virgin's &s;tate, after they have attained unto it. This made <HI>Paul</HI> exhort tho&s;e he wrote to, <HI>To beware le&s;t the &s;erpent beguiled them as he did</HI> Eve. <HI>How was that?</HI> Why, draw or allure them out of innocency, out of harmle&s;sne&s;s and a &s;inle&s;s &s;tate, into &s;in or breach of God's commandments, to the lo&s;s of Paradi&s;e. This he hath done, and may do again. People may lo&s;e a good &s;tate, yea, their place in Paradi&s;e, if not watchful; therefore good is it to wait and watch in the light, which not only leadeth into the garden of God again, and bringeth to the tree of life, and gives right to eat thereof, but al&s;o pre&s;erveth in the &s;ame; di&s;covers and gives dominion over the tempter, and keepeth from falling into the temptation.</P>
<P>It is no wonder to us, why the old enemy of mankind rageth again&s;t the truth, under this name <HI>Light;</HI> and that he gives it &s;o many approbrious and de&s;picable names, that people might not regard it, nor believe in it <HI>as it is;</HI> knowing that it under|mines his kingdom of darkne&s;s, and di&s;covers him and all his works, and de&s;troys them al&s;o. We are witne&s;&s;es of the pow|er and virtue of faith in the <HI>Light,</HI> that it is able to break all
<PB N="54" REF="013006_0068_0F8FB1CA2FFA2A60">the chains of darkne&s;s, and deliver out of the fetters of death and hell; and we al&s;o know, that there is not any other way or means under Heaven appointed of God, that is able to effect this work. All other ways, means and inventions of men, are not able to break one link of the chains of darkne&s;s. 'Tis faith in Chri&s;t the <HI>Light,</HI> which reproveth the world of &s;in. Though this light &s;hines in the world in wicked men in darkne&s;s, yet they having not faith in it, believing not in it, as that in which God dwells, they never know the &s;aving power and virtue thereof; yet its reproving and condemning power &s;uch &s;hall not e&s;cape.</P>
<P N="52">LII. It is a ble&s;&s;ed thing, for People <HI>to know the name of the Lord,</HI> even as &s;ome in ages pa&s;t knew it, and have left their knowledge and experience upon record; who could &s;ay and witne&s;s, that <HI>the name of the Lord</HI> was as a <HI>buckler,</HI> as a <HI>&s;hield,</HI> as a <HI>tower of defence,</HI> yea, as a <HI>&s;trong tower,</HI> into which the righteous fled and were &s;afe. It is very precious for people &s;o to know the name of the Lord, and to meet together in it; &s;uch are in a capacity to enjoy, po&s;&s;e&s;s and inherit all the <HI>ble&s;&s;ings</HI> that ever were promi&s;ed, and to avoid and e&s;cape all the <HI>cur&s;es</HI> that were ever threatned.</P>
<P>The glorious light of the go&s;pel, that now &s;hineth, is the <HI>name of the Lord,</HI> whereby he hath made him&s;elf manife&s;t to us in this our day and age. As we wait together, and walk in this name, we are witne&s;&s;es and experiencers of the fulfilling of that promi&s;e, <HI>Where two or three are met together in my name, there am I in the mid&s;t;</HI> &s;uch know their teacher, their Saviour, in the mid&s;t, and their eye is towards him, and their ear open to his voice, who is a teacher, one of a thou&s;and, who teach|eth to profit indeed. Many, that have learned of him, can &s;ay, <HI>They &s;oon became wi&s;er than all their former teachers.</HI> Thus to hear and learn of him is the ble&s;&s;ed end of all preaching, hearing and believing; and of all the ordinances, mini&s;trati|ons, di&s;pen&s;ations and appointments of God, ever &s;ince the fall of man, even to <HI>hear and obey the voice of the Son of God,</HI> who is light, and dwells in the light, wherein the righteous in all ages had fellow&s;hip with God, and one with another.</P>
<P>To know this <HI>name,</HI> is more than talk and a bare profe&s;&s;ion. To know it as a &s;afe hiding place, a &s;ure rock, and tower of defence when the enemy a&s;&s;aults, when floods of temptations attend, when arrows fly by night, and cea&s;e not in the day; when &s;torms de&s;cend, and winds blow. This was and is the ble&s;&s;ed end of the knowledge of the <HI>name</HI> of the Lord in all ages, to &s;ave and pre&s;erve them that <HI>have</HI> it, from all dangers that attend them at all times and in all places, from the enemy
<PB N="55" REF="013006_0069_0F8FB1CCAD9A02E0">of their &s;ouls, that his fiery darts may not hurt them, nor his floods drown them, nor the &s;torms and winds overthrow them, nor the enemies of their own hou&s;e prevail again&s;t them.</P>
<P>This was the rea&s;on why tho&s;e that knew it, compared it to a <HI>&s;trong tower,</HI> &amp;c. They often meditated in it, and thought upon the name of the Lord, and thereby found &s;trength to <HI>ab|&s;tain from every appearance of evil,</HI> and to re&s;i&s;t the devil in all his attempts. This is a happy &s;tate indeed, which tho&s;e only that know the name of the Lord, and can tru&s;t it, do enjoy.</P>
<P>By this may all the bare profe&s;&s;ors of all the various names in <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> &s;o called, be proved and tried; who talk much and profe&s;s much, of the name of the Lord, but do not <HI>depart from iniquity, do not cea&s;e from evil,</HI> do not know his name as a <HI>&s;trong tower,</HI> to &s;ave and pre&s;erve them from the &s;trength and power of the enemy of their &s;ouls; &s;o notwith&s;tanding their great profe&s;&s;ion of the name of the Lord, they do <HI>not depart from iniquity;</HI> and though they take his name into their mouths, they <HI>hate to be reformed by him;</HI> which is a great abomination to the Lord, and &s;tinks in his no&s;trils. For this I te&s;tify in the name of the Lord, that all people upon the face of the earth, let their name and &s;ort of religion be what it will, who profe&s;s the name of the Lord, and are found in <HI>evil doing,</HI> their profe&s;&s;ion is vain, and their religion a lye. In &s;in they live, and in &s;in they will die, except they come to know that repentance which is never to be repented of; till which, they can never come to know the name of the Lord as a <HI>&s;trong tower, buckler or &s;hield;</HI> but are led captive and en&s;nared by the ene|my of their &s;ouls, even at his plea&s;ure.</P>
<P N="53">LIII. In this &s;tands our ble&s;&s;edne&s;s and everla&s;ting happi|ne&s;s, as our eye is kept always looking to Je&s;us, the author and fini&s;her of our faith, and not only to know him the <HI>author,</HI> the <HI>beginner</HI> of faith, but the <HI>fini&s;her,</HI> the <HI>ender</HI> al&s;o; to know the end of faith, which is the <HI>&s;alvation of our &s;ouls;</HI> &s;uch know &s;al|vation nearer than when they fir&s;t believed.

Many are living wit|nes;&s;es in this age, as in ages pa&s;t, of the power of faith, even in the beginning of its work; but it is an higher &s;tate to know the end of it, the fini&s;hing of it, to know the work thereof done; to know the heart purified by it, and the victory over the world obtained; the wicked one &s;ubdued and overcome, brought down and de&s;troyed.

This is the ble&s;&s;ed end of the mini&s;try and mini&s;ters of truth the Lord hath &s;ent among&s;t us, and of all preaching, writing and printing, even that every one's eye might be turned to Je&s;us, always looking to him who hath be|gun the good work, and who alone is able to fini&s;h it.</P>

It is a ble&s;&s;ed thing to know and witne&s;s <HI>a meeting and waiting together in the name of Je&s;us;</HI> &s;uch as meet in this name, and know Je&s;us the peaceable Saviour in the mid&s;t of them, know the heavenly adorning of a meek and quiet &s;pirit, the prince of peace, and his peaceable government, the Lamb upon the throne, the righteous bearing rule, the land rejoicing, and heavenly peace in their borders.</P>
<P>It is the true waiters and meeters in this name, that enjoy all the ble&s;&s;ings promi&s;ed. It is they that know their &s;trength, faith and confidence in God renewed; their wi&s;dom and know|ledge encrea&s;ed with the encrea&s;e of God; they know the light to &s;hine more and more unto a perfect day, as was wit|ne&s;&s;ed of old, <HI>The ju&s;t man's path is as a &s;hining light, that &s;hineth more and more unto a perfect day.</HI></P>

Judgment begins at the hou&s;e of God, to purge away and &s;weep out all that doth defile, and to lay wa&s;te <HI>Babylon,</HI> the city of confu&s;ion, the my&s;tery of iniquity. The&s;e things are to be known and experienced in every parti|cular, even <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> &s;earched and clean&s;ed, and <HI>Babylon</HI> wa&s;t|ed and de&s;troyed; and the increa&s;e of the kindom of Heaven within, the power, light, and glory thereof &s;hining more and more within. As in this name we meet and abide, we feel the kingdom come, and the will of God done; and what&s;oe|ver we a&s;k in this name, we receive, according to Chri&s;t's pro|mi&s;e; for we have not been called to a &s;ound of words, to

The&s;e things are a remnant come unto, and do enjoy. This is the crown and rejoicing of the me&s;&s;engers and mini&s;ters of the Lord, when they come among us, to find us feeding on the bread of life; enjoying and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;ub&s;tance, peace, life, and everla&s;ting &s;alvation: And it is their &s;orrow and trouble to find a people under the profe&s;&s;ion of truth, always learning, but never learned; always hearing, and yet ignorant of the voice of the word of life in them&s;elves, and of that living bread which comes down from Heaven.</P>
<P N="58">LVIII.

They love him in all his ap|pearances, manife&s;tations, di&s;pen&s;ations and operations; whe|ther he appears as a judge, a convincer, a reprover, a refiner with fire, and a fuller with &s;oap; or a comforter; &s;aviour, or prince of peace. In all the&s;e he is precious to tho&s;e that be|lieve in him, becau&s;e they know and believe, that the ble&s;&s;ed end of every appearance and operation of his &s;pirit in them, is in order to make them happy.</P>
<P>It is very ble&s;&s;ed to know him appear as a judge, a reprover, a refiner and fuller, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This is more than a bare profe&s;&s;ion, and beyond all the nominal <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> upon the face of the earth; but it is much more ble&s;&s;ed to know him a fini&s;her of the work, to know judgment brought forth to victory, to know a being refined, a being purified, a being &s;anctified and &s;aved.

<P>It is very precious and ab&s;olutely needful, for every parti|cular that profe&s;&s;eth the name of Chri&s;t, and faith that he is a believer in him, to feel and know his heart and mind truly in love with every appearance of him in his &s;oul; to follow it and obey it, and to enjoy the end thereof, <HI>viz.</HI> Everla&s;ting &s;alvation brought in, &s;in made an end of, that he may appear the &s;econd time without &s;in unto &s;alvation.

This is the new and living way, and there is not another. All that are out of this way, are &s;trangers to it in their minds, their hearts being ali|enated from it, never come to inherit &s;ub&s;tance, nor to know everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s brought in, unrighteou&s;ne&s;s fini&s;hed and ca&s;t forth, the hou&s;e &s;wept, purged and clean&s;ed, and they made an habitation for God in the &s;pirit, but do remain as a cage for unclean birds, and a place for dragons; though they may talk of the fame of wi&s;dom, &s;anctification and redemp|tion, righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;alvation, yet they are found in the contrary; in captivity and bondage, though they talk of free|dom and redemption; in unholine&s;s and corruption, while they talk of &s;actification and righteou&s;ne&s;s. <HI>Let all concerned con&s;ider hereof.</HI></P>

This is the wor&s;hip a remnant are brought unto, which wor&s;hip doth not always begin when their &s;olemn meetings begin, neither doth it end when they part.

<P N="61">LXI. Of a truth, the times of <HI>refre&s;hing</HI> are come from the pre&s;ence of the Lord, the <HI>&s;howers</HI> from Heaven are falling, and the <HI>heavenly manna</HI> is rained down, and many are livingly refre&s;hed therewith, and are become as a well watered gar|den: Who were as a de&s;ert and wilderne&s;s, are now blo&s;&s;om|ing as a ro&s;e; and tho&s;e that were barren, now bear and bring forth fruit unto God. This is the Lord's doing, and is marvellous in the eyes of a remnant.</P>
<P>Ble&s;&s;ed are the people that can meet together with one ac|cord, and &s;it before the Lord waiting upon him. Such at times are favoured to &s;it as at a banquet, and have a table richly &s;pread before them; they eat and drink and their &s;ouls are &s;atisfied. Their everla&s;ting happine&s;s and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s &s;tands in this; in feeling their hearts and minds continually drawn nigh unto the Lord, and &s;taid upon him, not only in their &s;o|lemn meetings, but at other times. In this they are pre&s;erved in a capacity to partake of the mercies and ble&s;&s;ings of the Lord daily. This is a ble&s;&s;ed and &s;afe &s;tate indeed; to know a &s;tay to the mind, to know the heart fixed, joined, &s;ettled upon the Lord. Such cannot be ea&s;ily moved, neither can the ene|my prevail again&s;t &s;uch, nor the &s;tranger intermeddle with their joy. Their bread is &s;ure, and their water fails not. They are witne&s;&s;es of the truth of that Prophet's words, who &s;aid, &s;peaking of the Lord, <HI>Thou wilt keep them in perfect peace who&s;e minds are &s;taid upon thee.</HI> What can any de&s;ire more than perfect peace? Peace that is intire, wanting nothing, full of &s;atisfaction, and rejoicing in the inward man. Oh! what would a remnant have given in times pa&s;t, to have known a &s;tay to their minds, to have known the heavenly trea&s;ure which is &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy, refre&s;h and con&s;olate their &s;ouls! This is the pearl of great price. This is the eating of the tree
<PB N="62" REF="013006_0076_0F8FB1D1AF2A47A0">of life indeed, and is the only way and means to come to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the trea&s;ures of wi&s;dom and knowledge that lie hid in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and to inherit all the ble&s;&s;ings that at|tend the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> religion we profe&s;s; but tho&s;e that are of a wandering mind, their thoughts, wills and affections un&s;ubdu|ed, unmortified, they are in that &s;tate wherein they know not when good comes, and as broken ci&s;terns that can hold no water.</P>
<P>So this is the main thing, wherein our &s;afety and happine&s;s &s;tands, <HI>viz.</HI> to know our minds and hearts drawn nigh unto the Lord, our eye fixed upon him: that after we have partook of his ble&s;&s;ings, and been refre&s;hed with his pre&s;ence, we may abide in a frame of mind, ready to receive of him that which doth &s;atisfy our &s;ouls, and mini&s;ter true content to our minds. Nothing is able thus to do, but the daily bread. What we eat to-day, will not &s;erve to-morrow. <HI>Give us this day our daily bread.</HI> Bread every day fre&s;h from the table of the Lord. Hereby is the growing from grace to grace, from faith to faith, from one degree of glory unto another witne&s;&s;ed, even till we all come unto the &s;tature and fulne&s;s of Chri&s;t. The more any thus truly wait to enjoy, the more they feel their &s;trength re|newed with heavenly encouragement, &s;o that they can <HI>run and not be weary,</HI> and <HI>walk and not be faint.</HI></P>
<P N="62">LXII. That which makes a people ble&s;&s;ed and happy, is, <HI>that they hear and obey</HI> the &s;till &s;mall voice, which &s;aith, <HI>This is the way, walk in it.</HI> This is the voice of the true &s;hepherd, and the &s;heep know it, follow it and obey it, and a &s;tranger they will not hear not follow. In this lay the &s;afety, &s;trength and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of the righteous, in all ages and generations pa&s;t, even in hearing and obeying the voice of the Lord. Herein they gained victory over their enemies, and knew them all confounded and brought to nought. This is the &s;trength and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of the righteous in this age and generation, by which they overcome their enemies. As we hear and obey this voice, we grow &s;trong and prevail again&s;t all our ene|mies, even tho&s;e of our own hou&s;e, which are our greate&s;t enemies. In obeying this heavenly voice, which calls out of all the crooked ways and bye-paths of &s;in and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, into the &s;trait and living way of the Lord, and pre&s;erveth in the &s;ame, that we return not into them again, that we enter not into the way of &s;in and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, that we are not captivated in the way of darkne&s;s and error, out of which we have been called, and from which we have been redeemed and &s;aved with a great &s;alvation. Prai&s;es be to the name of the Lord, who hath cau&s;ed his glorious day to
<PB N="63" REF="013006_0077_0F8FB1D451088CC8">dawn, and his heavenly voice to be heard and known, from all the voices that are in the world, and from the voice of the &s;erpent, though it many times &s;peaks very low and &s;mall. Yet ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, we hear and know it from the voice of our enemy, from the voice of the &s;tranger, becau&s;e it calls out of all evil and error, into purity and holine&s;s; out of all &s;elf-will, thoughts and imaginations, into the heavenly &s;till|n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s, &s;elf-denial, deep humility, and lowline&s;s of mind; which is the low valley where the fre&s;h pa&s;tures are, and the &s;prings of life are known, where &s;atisfaction is enjoyed, and peace and tranquility of mind po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. This is the &s;ub&s;tance of all. This is that we have been and are called to, in this the glori|ous day of God's appearance, in this his vi&s;itation of us with his day-&s;pring from on high, which &s;hineth gloriou&s;ly to a remnant: Prai&s;es to God forever.</P>
<P N="63">LXIII. Tho&s;e are the ble&s;&s;ed people, <HI>who have not their teacher to &s;ee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, their Saviour and Redeemer to &s;eek;</HI> but their eye <HI>beholds him,</HI> and their ear <HI>heareth his voice;</HI> witne&s;&s;ing and en|joying what one of old knew, when he &s;aid, <HI>I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he &s;hall &s;tand la&s;t upon the earth.</HI> This is an heavenly &s;tate, which a &s;mall remnant witne&s;s, even to &s;ee their their Redeemer <HI>&s;tand la&s;t upon the earth.</HI> He was the fir&s;t upon it, and is known to be the la&s;t al&s;o; &s;ubduing all under him; the earth to be his foot-&s;tool; all earthly mindedne&s;s, earthly de&s;ires, earthly affections, trodden down and trampled upon by him; every vain thought and lofty imagination &s;ub|dued under him, all our enemies de&s;troyed by him. But no people nor per&s;on upon the face of the earth, can witne&s;s the&s;e things effected in them, but as they travel through the work of regeneration, and come to know that their Redeemer liveth not only in him&s;elf, but al&s;o in them. Then tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion is known to be fini&s;hed, and everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s brought in. Then the Prince of peace and righteou&s;ne&s;s reigns, &s;its upon the throne and rules; where the prince of the power of the air and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s did rule. Then doth the land rejoice, and heavenly peace abounds in their dwellings; which peace can|not be enjoyed by any, let them profe&s;s what they will, tho' it be the truth it&s;elf, unle&s;s they experimentally know their Teacher, their Saviour, their Redeemer.</P>
<P N="64">LXIV. The very remembrance of the time, wherein our minds were turned <HI>to the true light that now &s;hineth,</HI> not only in darkne&s;s, but out of it, is very precious; in which God <HI>dwells,</HI> in which we are living witne&s;&s;es of his <HI>pre&s;ence</HI> and <HI>appearance,</HI> which mini&s;treth more con&s;olation, refre&s;hment and gladne&s;s in our hearts, than the increa&s;e of corn, wine and oil. The
<PB N="64" REF="013006_0078_0F8FB1D5188223B0">exceeding love and kindne&s;s of God, in fitting and preparing in&s;truments in his own hand, and by his own power, to turn and direct our minds to the light of Chri&s;t within, to the pow|er of God within, is never to be forgotten. The waiting in which, and the obedience to which, makes us and our a&s;&s;em|blies to differ from tho&s;e who are &s;trangers thereunto; the which, as we wait in and obey, we never have our teacher to &s;eek, our guide and in&s;tructor to &s;eek, though no word be &s;poken outwardly.</P>
<P>It is a precious thing to love this light, and to walk in it. That is the only way to be a child of it. It is the high-way that was prophe&s;ied &s;hould <HI>be ca&s;t up, wherein the way-faring man, though a fool, &s;hould not err.</HI> There is no &s;tumbling in this way, nor <HI>no occa&s;ion of &s;tumbling.</HI> As we walk and abide therein, we are, and &s;hall be the mo&s;t contented people, the wi&s;e&s;t, &s;tronge&s;t and happie&s;t people upon the face of the earth: but out of it, we are as weak as any; and after we are come to the knowledge of this way, if we abide not therein, we may al&s;o become as wicked as any.</P>
<P>There is no other way to be looked for, no other go&s;pel to be preached than this, to which our minds were turned at the beginning, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Light,</HI> the <HI>Grace and Power of God,</HI> the <HI>Pearl,</HI> the <HI>Trea&s;ure,</HI> the <HI>Kingdom within;</HI> in which the key is known, that openeth not only the my&s;teries of godline&s;s, but the my&s;tery of iniquity al&s;o; and brings our eye to be &s;atisfied with &s;eeing, our ear with hearing, and our heart with under|&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Oh! how are we engaged to walk in this way! to walk worthy of this love which is &s;hed abroad in our hearts, which we are made partakers of, that we may adorn our profe&s;&s;ion with all holine&s;s of life and conver&s;ation; to the prai&s;e of him that hath called us out of darkne&s;s into his marvelous light. To whom be glory forever.</P>
<P N="65">LXV. It is a ble&s;&s;ed thing, to know <HI>the kingdom of God to be come,</HI> even the &s;ame kingdom which Chri&s;t long &s;ince taught his di&s;ciples to pray for; and which he in this age hath taught his di&s;ciples to pray for. It is a ble&s;&s;ed thing to know this kingdom to be come, but it is more ble&s;&s;ed to know a &s;itting down in it, and partaking of that wherein it &s;tands, <HI>viz. Peace and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t;</HI> which all the kingdoms of this world cannot give, nor take away.</P>
<P>Now the cau&s;e why we in time pa&s;t, as well as others, were ignorant of the coming of this kingdom, and wanted the en|joyment of that wherein it &s;tands, was becau&s;e we di&s;regard|ed its appearance, and over-looked the &s;eed of it, and &s;lighted
<PB N="65" REF="013006_0079_0F8FB1D583A3B3A0">the operation of it; which is like the working of leaven in meal. This was the cau&s;e, even becau&s;e we did not regard the day of &s;mall things; we had no faith in the holy power and &s;piritual appearance of God within, which always wrought again&s;t evil, and the author of it, and his kingdom of dark|ne&s;s, though but as a little leaven or &s;mall &s;eed.</P>
<P>And all the &s;ects and &s;ect-ma&s;ters in <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> who over|look the &s;eed of the kingdom, which works like leaven in all that have &s;aith in it, and de&s;pi&s;e the appearance and operati|on of the light and &s;pirit of God within, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> never know the coming of the kingdom of God, nor the &s;itting down in it.

<P>But all that know the coming of this kingdom, and a &s;itting down in it, and the enjoyment of that wherein it &s;tands, which is peace and joy in the Holy Gho&s;t; they are living witne&s;&s;es of their being gathered from the ea&s;t, we&s;t, north and &s;outh, and of &s;itting down with <HI>Abraham, I&s;aac,</HI> and <HI>Jacob</HI> in the kingdom of God, and can &s;ay as &s;ome of old could, which the author to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> wrote to, when he &s;aid. <HI>But ye are come unto Mount</HI> Sion, <HI>and unto the ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y of the living God; the heavenly</HI> Jeru&s;alem, <HI>and to an innumerable company of angels, to the general a&s;&s;embly and church of the fir&s;t-born, which are written in Heaven; and to God the Judge of all, and to the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect; and to Je&s;us the mediator of the new covenant; and to the blood of &s;prinkling, that &s;peakerb better things than the blood of</HI> Abel. Were not the&s;e things written in the holy Scriptures, it might or would be counted unlawful, if not bla&s;phemy, to &s;peak or write after this manner. But the kingdom and power of God is one and the &s;ame throughout all ages, and was the dwelling-place of the righteous in all generations; even the &s;ame our minds were at fir&s;t turned and directed to, who&s;e fir&s;t appearance was as a <HI>light</HI> &s;hining in a dark place; as a <HI>little &s;eed</HI> &s;pringing out of a dry ground; as a <HI>little leaven</HI> work|ing in the meal, according to the parables and teachings of Chri&s;t Je&s;us. This was the lot and inheritance which the holy men and holy women in ages pa&s;t waited for and received, and glorified and prai&s;ed God for the enjoyment thereof, in the mid&s;t of all afflictions and fiery trials, and over them all. This was their joy and crown, and the righteous in this age de&s;ire no other.</P>

All the trea&s;ures and plea&s;ures of this world, are not to be compared with it; for there is no|thing able to content the &s;oul, and to &s;top its hungering and thir&s;ting after tho&s;e things that peri&s;h with the u&s;ing, but the eating of this bread: And the more any eat of this bread, the more they hunger after it.

<P N="67">LXVII.

All that have learned of him, and are guided by his &s;pirit, are thereby led to within the vail, into the holie&s;t of holies, and know the vail to be taken away, not only the vail of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and the vail of the outward <HI>Temple,</HI> but al&s;o the vail of <HI>the fle&s;h of Chri&s;t;</HI> and are come to behold him, and dwell with him, who was before the cau&s;e of vails had a being; before the cau&s;e of the law, the labour of the Prophets, and &s;uffering of Chri&s;t had a being.

<P>This is the ble&s;&s;ed end of waiting upon God, as the hand|maid doth upon the eye of her mi&s;tre&s;s.

<PB N="67" REF="013006_0081_0F8FB1D6F6F3CB78">unto him, who teacheth in his temple, and who&s;e glory ap|pears in his temple. The&s;e are the ble&s;&s;ed people that have this knowledge; and all that have it, know how they come by it, and how they became &s;o, having been the temples of the unclean &s;pirit. They know the temple that was defiled and polluted, clean&s;ed and purged, and the unclean &s;pirit and his works ca&s;t forth. The&s;e are a watchful people again&s;t all that would defile the temple again, and the&s;e are the true temple wor&s;hippers in this day and age, and this is the temple in which every one &s;peaks of the <HI>glory of the Lord,</HI> of the <HI>pow|er of the Lord,</HI> and of <HI>his wonderous works wrought therein,</HI> even <HI>in his temple not made with hands.</HI></P>
<P>This is the antitype and &s;ub&s;tance of the outward temple built by <HI>Solomon,</HI> and the various wor&s;hips and &s;ervices therein; even when people are brought into &s;uch a &s;tate, as to know their bodies the temple of the living God; that he walks in them, and dwells in them, according to the ancient prophecies of holy men.

<P>The outward temple, after it was fini&s;hed and &s;anctified, became defiled, polluted, and made as a den of thieves, there|fore it became robbed, and &s;poiled of all its trea&s;ure, and &s;o in the end de&s;troyed. This was or came to pa&s;s in the figure, and is written for our learning: <HI>Let all be watchful and take heed, le&s;t after they know their bodies the temples of God, &s;anctified or made holy, they become polluted and defiled again.</HI> Such God will de&s;troy with woful de&s;truction.</P>
<P>It is very precious when people are come, not only to know their bodies the temples of the Holy Gho&s;t, which knowledge is ab&s;olutely needful, for without it there is no being a <HI>Chri&s;ti|an,</HI> but al&s;o are come to know an heavenly &s;tillne&s;s, an hea|venly &s;ilence in the temple, no buying and &s;elling, nor ex|changing; no noi&s;e of the workman's iron-tool in the tem|ple, for that defiles the temple, and pollutes the altar, if it be but lifted up upon it. The be&s;t parts, inventions and arts of man in the fall, hath nothing to do in rearing an altar, in building a temple, nor in &s;etting up a wor&s;hip, or offering &s;a|crifices to God.

<HEAD>A TREATISE CONCERNING THOUGHTS and IMAGINATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>EVIL thoughts and imaginations, are great troublers of the world; and it is a great mi&s;ery which man is accompa|nied and &s;urrounded with, who is given up to follow and obey his own evil thoughts and imaginations; or to walk according to them: It was a &s;ore judgment pronounced again&s;t the di&s;o|bedient rebellious <HI>Jews,</HI> in the word of the Lord by <HI>Jeremy,</HI> &s;aying, <HI>Hear O earth, behold I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts.</HI> And the Lord by the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> &s;aith, <HI>I have &s;tretched out my hand all day to a rebellious people, which walked in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts, which are thoughts of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.</HI> Al&s;o it is written, <HI>Every thought and imagination of man's heart are only evil, and that continually.</HI> And very great is the mi&s;ery, bondage, and &s;lavery of mankind in this e&s;tate; he is an ene|my to God, and to him&s;elf, and to his neighbour and brother, <HI>Wa&s;ting and de&s;truction are in their paths, who have not God in all their thoughts.</HI></P>
<P>Now reader, that which is principally on my mind, is, to &s;et before thee a certain infallible way, how thou maye&s;t come to be &s;aved from following or obeying thy own thoughts, and to gain &s;trength again&s;t, and get victory over all thy ima|ginations that are evil; and al&s;o how thou maye&s;t attain to good thoughts and heavenly meditations in the room thereof; and how thou maye&s;t come to know every good thought and de&s;ire brought into the obedience of Chri&s;t, and every evil thought and imagination de&s;troyed, and con&s;umed with the breath of his mouth, and the brighne&s;s of his appearing. And
<PB N="72" REF="013006_0085_0F8FB1D9F02272E0">when thou art re&s;tored and brought into the &s;ame e&s;tate man was in before tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, even into the garden of God, how thou mu&s;t then dre&s;s and keep the garden. Thou mu&s;t then watch over, and in the wi&s;dom and power of God, govern thy thoughts, le&s;t the &s;erpent beguile thee as he did <HI>Eve.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t, thou mu&s;t under&s;tand that from the ground evil thoughts and imaginations ari&s;e from, &s;pring all the briers, thorns, and thi&s;tles, and other hurtful weeds in the world of mankind, in who&s;e heart they began to &s;pring, grow and in|crea&s;e, even &s;o &s;oon as he began to lo&s;e his faith in God his maker, and incline to hearken to the voice of the &s;erpent, and give credit to his lies which begot a vain thought; from whence a fal&s;e hope &s;prung, that they &s;hould by eating the forbidden fruit, better their conditions, <HI>be as Gods,</HI> according as the &s;erpent told the woman, the weaker ve&s;&s;el, and by this fal&s;e hope, grounded upon the thoughts and imaginations, en|tered the fir&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; then when the temptation was entered into, and &s;in committed, thoughts and imaginations began to multiply and fill the di&s;obedient earthly heart of man, who having now turned his back upon the heavenly, &s;lighted the voice and command of God, who was his <HI>teacher</HI> and <HI>law|giver,</HI> and lent his ear to the wicked one, and gave up his mind and heart to obey him, even with thoughts it was all for the be&s;t. Thus poor man being deceived with vain thoughts, and fal&s;e hope, lo&s;t his habitation and dwelling-place in Paradi&s;e; which after he had tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, he &s;till thought to keep; for he was &s;oon convinced he had done ami&s;s in eating the forbidden fruit, and fear po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his heart, when he heard the voice of God in the cool of the day, and there|fore &s;ought means to cover and hide him&s;elf from the &s;ight of God: But herein his thoughts were vain, and his endea|vours to no purpo&s;e; the woman, man, and &s;erpent, all re|ceived the fruits of their own doings; nothing but life, good and ble&s;&s;ings were known before; now death, evil and cur&s;ing, the fruit and effect of di&s;obedience, (which as I have &s;aid, en|tered fir&s;t by giving place to a vain thought and de&s;ire, in hope to gain and better their e&s;tate) became the daily companions of mankind, who found and finds by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oful experience, that &s;aying true, <HI>When &s;in is fini&s;hed it brings forth death.</HI></P>
<P>So man having lo&s;t his place in the garden which God planted, through neglecting his work which God appointed him to do, which was <HI>to dre&s;s it, and to keep it;</HI> for the garden needed dre&s;&s;ing and keeping before the forbidden fruit was eaten, innocency, was lo&s;t, and &s;in was committed.</P>
<P>And this ari&s;eth in my mind, to te&s;tify to all the wi&s;e in
<PB N="73" REF="013006_0086_0F8FB1DCD389EC30">heart, that after they are come to find that which was lo&s;t, to witne&s;s a re&s;toration and regeneration, and a returning into <HI>Eden,</HI> into innocency, they have work there to do; <HI>dre&s;&s;ing</HI> and <HI>keeping</HI> are two very &s;ignificant words. This was the bu|&s;ine&s;s of man in the beginning, in the &s;tate of innocency; if he had not neglected this work, &s;lighted the light, power, wi&s;dom and glory of God, with which he was repleni&s;hed, he had never fell; when the temptation got into a thought, if he had watched in the light and wi&s;dom of God, he would have &s;een and di&s;covered the tendency of it, and have pre|vented its coming to a de&s;ire and act: But fir&s;t giving place to a &s;elfi&s;h thought, it &s;oon &s;prang to a hunger or de&s;ire, thence in|to act, this is the beginning and progre&s;s of &s;in at this day, which mankind in innocency had; and hath power and wi&s;|dom from God to prevent, if he abide in it, and keep in his watch-tower, the light and &s;trength of God, which is as near him as the temptation can be, and &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve him: And where this work is neglected, men, yea, holy men fall, and &s;in after the &s;imilitude of <HI>Adam</HI>'s tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and are be|guiled as the &s;erpent did <HI>Eve,</HI> drawn out of innocency, and a &s;inle&s;s e&s;tate after they have attained unto it; therefore let none be high-minded, but fear and take the &s;econd <HI>Adam</HI> for example, who when he was tempted, did not de&s;ire after the things pre&s;ented, though very &s;pecious in appearance and ac|companied with very large promi&s;es; even as the fir&s;t <HI>Adam</HI> had: But 'tis written, while the temptation la&s;ted he eat no|thing; he let nothing in, gave no place to &s;elfi&s;h thoughts, and enticements of the enemy: So when the temptation was over, angels mini&s;tred unto him: Let this be the example of all the children of light, and as they do thereafter, the pow|erful &s;alvation of God &s;hall &s;urround them, <HI>And neither heights nor depths, angels, principalities, nor powers, things pre&s;ent, or things to come, &s;hall be able to &s;eperate them from the love of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> This is a word by the way.</P>
<P>Now evil thoughts and imaginations are of a multiplying na|ture, and do mainly increa&s;e and take root in the generality of mankind; who through evil works are e&s;tranged from the life of God, remaining a degenerate plant, &s;prang from the &s;eed of the evil doer, and dwells and labours in that ground which God hath cur&s;ed, and knows not the &s;eed of the woman to brui&s;e the &s;erpent's head, and to redeem and pre&s;erve him from following and obeying his own thoughts and imaginati|ons, which are evil, and that continually. And indeed in that &s;tate can be no otherwi&s;e, whether they lead into &s;elf-&s;aming
<PB N="74" REF="013006_0087_0F8FB1DD9A9FFE88">or &s;elf-righteou&s;ne&s;s, both are abomination to the Lord, and de&s;tructive to the well-being of mankind, both temporal and eternal: For all the wickedne&s;s that hath been brought forth and acted in the world &s;ince the beginning, began or appeared fir&s;t in the thought; and the thought being cheri&s;hed and join|ed to by the mind, will, and under&s;tanding, it increa&s;ed, and increa&s;eth into words and actions. That which is clean can|not proceed from that which is unclean; the heart of man|kind in the fall is univer&s;ally corrupted, and de&s;perately wick|ed: And, as hath been &s;aid, the thoughts and imaginations thereof are evil, and that continually: And before it can be otherwi&s;e, there is an ab&s;olute neceffity that every particular man and woman know and experience for, and in them&s;elves, their hearts clean&s;ed, purged and purified, and created new; the ground mu&s;t be made good, before the &s;eed, the heavenly plant can grow, increa&s;e and flouri&s;h therein; before good thoughts, heavenly thoughts and meditations can ari&s;e, &s;pring and remain therein. And when this e&s;tate is known, and en|joyed, then to abide with him, dwell and walk with him, who hath wrought the&s;e mighty things in thee, and for thee, and in his wi&s;dom and power to dre&s;s and keep the garden, the heart, with all diligence, that that which would defile en|ter not, creep in again, as it did in the beginning, which is po&s;&s;ible. Therefore what the &s;pirit of God put man upon in the beginning, when he was a noble plant in <HI>Eden,</HI> wholly a right &s;eed, <HI>viz.</HI> to dre&s;s and keep the garden; &s;o the &s;pirit of God now in this age &s;aith, <HI>Watch and pray, le&s;t ye enter into temp|tation; take heed, le&s;t as the &s;erpent beguiled</HI> Eve, <HI>through his &s;ubti|lity, &s;o your minds &s;hould be corrupted from the &s;implicity that is in Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Now this I te&s;tify from certain knowledge, that God hath ordained means, whereby mankind, who&s;e heart is &s;o corrupt|ed, that nothing that is good proceeds out of it, neither any thing that is heavenly, and of God, &s;prings up in it, that can live a moment, being &s;o foul and &s;o dark, even like a foul dark piece of earth outwardly, on which the &s;un never &s;hines, nor the rain falls, that man in this mi&s;erable &s;tate may come to know and experience his foul heart clean&s;ed, purged and &s;anctified, as the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> in the primitive times did; <HI>Such were &s;ome of you, but now are you wa&s;hed, clean&s;ed, and &s;anctified,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>The fallow ground may be plowed up, and bear &s;eed, and the wilderne&s;s may become a fruitful field, and &s;treams may break forth in the de&s;ert, and the de&s;ert may come to rejoice and to blo&s;&s;om as a ro&s;e; crooked things may be made &s;traight, and rough places &s;mooth; great heavy dark high mountains may be brought down and removed, yea melted at the
<PB N="75" REF="013006_0088_0F8FB1DDDAC3D268">pre&s;ence of God, and the low vallies may be exalted; yea the wilder|ne&s;s may become like</HI> Eden, <HI>and the de&s;ert like the garden of the Lord.</HI> All the&s;e mighty works and wonders hath the Lord wrought in this age, in and for a remnant, who are come to the fulfil|ling of the prophecies, are living witne&s;&s;es of the &s;ame, and do in his holy &s;pirit, and power, proclaim that the love and mercy of God towards lo&s;t man, is univer&s;al, and that his hand is &s;tretched forth to help him out of the &s;nare, pit, and deep dark dungeon, wherein he is fallen; out of which he cannot by all his &s;trength, wi&s;dom, and invention, help him|&s;elf; and to &s;et him at liberty, that he may run the ways of his commandments with delight, and that he may come again to &s;tand upright, as God made man in the beginning; and lay a&s;ide all his thoughts and inventions, wherein he corrupted him&s;elf; and to bring him into &s;uch a &s;tate and condition, that he may be able to do all things that are good, to think good thoughts, &s;peak good words, and do good works; and &s;o e&s;|chew and avoid the contrary: This to know and be able to do, in the <HI>one thing</HI> needful, without which all men are mi&s;erable, let their knowledge, wi&s;dom, and profe&s;&s;ion of religion, opi|nion and invention, be what it will.</P>
<P>Therefore my mind is in good-will to mankind, having re|ceived knowledge and under&s;tanding of the means of God hath ordained for their good and &s;alvation: And being &s;ome|thing acquainted with the two great my&s;teries of godline&s;s and iniquity, and the way and working of each, to impart and &s;ig|nify &s;omething of the &s;ame in a few words, to in&s;truct and in|form tho&s;e to whom this my te&s;timony may come, how they may attain thereunto, and how they may come to be rid of tho&s;e trouble&s;ome companions, <HI>viz.</HI> evil thoughts and imagina|tions, that ari&s;e in their hearts, while corrupted; and how the &s;ame may be purified and made a holy habitation for God, as it was before &s;in entered, before innocency was lo&s;t, before the &s;erpent deceived the weaker ve&s;&s;el, when all was good, yea very good.</P>

<P>THE life of a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> of an <HI>I&s;raelite</HI> indeed, in whom is no guile, is a life of innocency, peace and content; qui|etne&s;s and true &s;atisfaction abounds in the inward man, &s;o none can harm him; he lives in the fear of God, which taught him to depart from iniquity, and now pre&s;erveth him out of the &s;ame, he loveth God and his neighbour, and hates no man, &s;o fears not what man can do unto him; his bread is &s;ure, and his water fails not: If he hath wife or children, hou&s;e or land, or the increa&s;e of corn, wine and oil, he looks upon them as things below, &s;o doth not &s;et his heart and affection upon them; he looks upon them as they are, and loves them in their places, but not more than Chri&s;t; he loves the Lord above all, he loves to keep his con&s;cience void of offence towards God, and to|wards man above all; and if he cannot enjoy his e&s;tate and re|lations according to the will of God, he is ready and willing to part with them, and can &s;ay as <HI>Job</HI> did, <HI>the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away; ble&s;&s;ed be the name of the Lord.</HI> He is not afraid of evil tidings; the ruffling of the winds, and the roaring of the &s;ea, doth not amaze nor affright him; he lives the life of faith, which gives him victory, and enables him to overcome all things, he keeps on the helmet of it, and the brea&s;t-plate of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and the &s;word of the &s;pirit, &s;o is always arm|ed again&s;t all a&s;&s;aults of the world, fle&s;h and the devil; and he knows the name of the Lord as a &s;trong tower, as a &s;hield, as a buckler, as a wall of defence, and is prepared to &s;uffer and endure all things, like a good &s;oldier with a &s;ettled countenance, and holy re&s;olution: And though by men he may be accounted &s;mitten and for&s;aken of God, and not &s;it to live upon the earth, yet he enjoys heavenly con&s;olation, pure tranquility of mind, refre&s;hment, comfort, and joy in the inward man; the King's daughter is all glorious within, and all things that do, or can befal a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> on this &s;ide the grave, are not worthy to be compared to the glory that <HI>is and &s;hall be revealed in him:</HI> And if there was no reward on the other &s;ide the grave, he would not exchange his life and condition, for all the gory, riches and excellency the world can afford, &s;eeing and account|ing it all vanity and vexation of &s;pirit, yea, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. xl. 17.&mdash;P&s;al. lxii. 9</NOTE> le&s;s than nothing and lighter than vanity.

<HEAD>Concerning <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Wor&s;hip, what it &s;tands in, and bow it is performed.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a great conte&s;t in <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> among the divers &s;ects and bare profe&s;&s;ions of <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> about wor&s;hip; and many are the modes and ceremonies that are cried up among them; every &s;ect conceiving their way to be right, all being full of di&s;pute, contention and quarelling one with and again&s;t another, envying and hating one another, fighting, killing and de&s;troying one another about them, when they are all but of their own devi&s;ing, forms and images of their own making, mo&s;tly from the example of <HI>Jews, Gentiles</HI> and apo&s;tate <HI>Chri&s;ti|ans,</HI> and are not led thereto, nor guided therein by the uner|ring &s;pirit of God, as their fruits makes fully manife&s;t, to the great &s;candal of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religion.</P>
<P>Now the true <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> wor&s;hip is in the &s;pirit, and in the truth, not in the letter, nor in the form barely, but was before all letters and outward laws and pre&s;criptions, inventions, er|rors, and the &s;pirit of them was: This was the wor&s;hip in Pa|radi&s;e; when mankind neglected this wor&s;hip he fell into evil, into invention, into error, which was the cau&s;e of the outward law, and all other di&s;pen&s;ations of God, for the recovery of lo&s;t man: And before he can witne&s;s a return out of his lo&s;t e&s;tate, he mu&s;t come again to the &s;ame wor&s;hip in the &s;pirit and in the truth, even the truth in the inward parts, for that is it which God loves; to the word in the mouth, to the law in the heart, and the fear in the inward parts, from all fear to|wards God, taught by the procepts of men, from all traditions of men of corrupt minds, from all devices and inventions of men: This is the ble&s;&s;ed e&s;tare the true <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> is come into, and is the end, &s;um, and &s;ub&s;tance of all holy writings, forms and holy traditions, mini&s;trations, and di&s;pen&s;ations before the law, under the law, and the Prophets: Wilderne&s;s, <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and temple-wor&s;hip which &s;tood in divers bodily exerci&s;es, out|ward works and &s;ervices, variety of offerings, ob&s;erving of times, days, months, and years, meats, drinks, outward wa&s;h|ings and purifications, new-moons, fa&s;ts, fea&s;ts, &s;olemn meet|ings, and general a&s;&s;emblies once a year at <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> all the&s;e
<PB N="88" REF="013006_0100_0F8FB1EA93098130">things were but &s;hadows and typical: And this is the antitype and &s;ub&s;tance &s;hadowed forth by them all. To come to the wor&s;hip in the <HI>&s;pirit,</HI> in the <HI>truth,</HI> to <HI>Mount Sion,</HI> the city of the living God, the heavenly <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> and to <HI>come to the general a&s;&s;embly and church of the fir&s;t-born, written in Heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect.</HI> To know the hea|venly city that comes down from God out of Heaven, even <HI>Je|ru&s;alem</HI> the mother of all the living citizens thereof, who&s;e law and covenant is &s;piritual, and writ in their hearts; who&s;e love, fear and obedience to God, is engraven in their inward parts: And from hence ari&s;eth the true wor&s;hip in the &s;pirit, and in the truth.</P>
<P>This is the wor&s;hip the primitive <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> came to, and were exerci&s;ed in; they prayed in the &s;pirit, not at any &s;et time, or appointed place only, according to the exhortations, <HI>pray always, pray continually, pray without cea&s;ing; I will that men pray every where, li&s;ting up holy hands without wrath or doubting:</HI> Breathing to the Lord in &s;pirit, though never a word be uttered; in the clo&s;et when the door is &s;hut, the Lord heareth and an&s;wereth this prayer. And many times they were, and are al&s;o led forth to pray in words publicly, but mo&s;tly for the &s;ake of others, and in the behalf of others, as Chri&s;t Je&s;us did.</P>
<P>The true <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> is al&s;o a preacher of righteou&s;ne&s;s, not only in words, at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">et times, and appointed places, but in life and conver&s;ation; in this he is a preacher, a teacher of that which is good, as a candle burneth and &s;et in the right place; his lamp trimmed, and his light &s;hineth, as a city upon a hill, as the &s;alt of the eartin, and light of the world, to &s;ea&s;on and give light to others, by holy example, which preacheth louder than words.</P>
<P>The true <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI>'s &s;inging or rejoicing is al&s;o in the &s;pirit and in the truth, and not in iniquity, and with a good under|&s;tanding; he needs no art nor invention to bring words into metre or rhime, that they may make a plea&s;ant &s;ound, and a joyful noi&s;e; his mu&s;ic doth not &s;tand in outward &s;ounds, made by art and air, but his melody is in his heart, in the &s;pirit, in the inward man, in the hidden man of the heart, which is the antitype and &s;ub&s;tance of all outward mu&s;ic u&s;ed in the time of the law, under the fir&s;t covenant, in the wor&s;hip and &s;ervice of God; and as far exceeds it, as the &s;ub&s;tance of a thing doth the &s;hadow thereof: And he that hath this heavenly inward re|joicing, and plea&s;ant melody in the heart, will never invent to him&s;elf in&s;truments of mu&s;ic like <HI>David,</HI> nor delight in the &s;ounds thereof. Where this heart-melody is lo&s;t, the outward invented mu&s;ic is &s;et up, among <HI>Jews, Gentiles</HI> and apo&s;tate

<P>Now the &s;pirit of God is univer&s;al, and the truth is univer&s;al, and the true <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> wor&s;hip that &s;tands in it, is al&s;o to be univer&s;al; not only when people meet together in a &s;olemn manner to wait upon God, but every hour and every day, bow|ing in &s;pirit, wor&s;hipping in the truth, which make free from all error, from all evil, from all vain ob&s;ervations, literal tra|ditions, and human inventions about the wor&s;hip of God, from all carnal ordinances, as <HI>mu&s;ics, meats, drinkings, wa&s;hings, fea&s;ts, fa&s;ts, days and times,</HI> which peri&s;h with the u&s;ing, though &s;ignifi|cant in their fir&s;t in&s;titution; the&s;e things are not to be touched, nor ta&s;ted, no nor &s;o much as handled by the true <HI>Chri&s;tian;</HI> the&s;e things are but beggarly elements, and worldly rudiments, which had a beginning, and mu&s;t have an end.</P>
<P>And the root or cau&s;e of a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> which is Chri&s;t, is the end of the law, and all the types and &s;hadows of it, and fulfils all the righteou&s;ne&s;s of it, of the Prophets, and of <HI>John</HI> al&s;o, and is a bringer in of a better hope, a better law, a better covenant, a better wor&s;hip; which hope, law, covenant and wor&s;hip, is inward and &s;piritual, and not outward and carnal, formal nor traditional: And all that are come to this wor&s;hip in the &s;pirit, and in the truth, which is one pure eternal principle of light, life and power, and have their hearts tendered by it, and their minds exerci&s;ed in it, their thoughts and meditations guided by it, they are come to the my&s;tery of the fellow&s;hip of the go&s;|pel, to the ble&s;&s;ed unity wherein is no &s;trife, no wrangling, di&s;puting, or contention; no treachery, wars, cruelty or vio|lence; becau&s;e they are all minding one thing, learning of one teacher, following of one guide, <HI>viz.</HI> the grace and &s;pirit of God: And though they have diver&s;ity of gifts, and are at|tained to different degrees of faith, of grace, of knowledge, growth and &s;alvation in the &s;ame; and are &s;ome as a foot, &s;ome as a hand, eye, ear and mouth, yet are all as members of one body; and the meane&s;t hath unity with the more noble, the greate&s;t with the lea&s;t, the lowe&s;t with the highe&s;t, the &s;trong|e&s;t with the weake&s;t. Nor is there any jar or &s;chi&s;m in this well framed body, of which Chri&s;t the unction, the anointing, is the head and teacher.</P>
<P>This heavenly unity is the antitype of the &s;eamle&s;s coat of

<P>Now there is no concord betwixt light and darkne&s;s, &s;in and righteou&s;ne&s;s, Chri&s;t and belial; the&s;e things of a <HI>different</HI> and <HI>contrary nature,</HI> cannot unite, cannot agree, though they are nigh to each other, &s;own in one field. God hath &s;own a good &s;eed in the field of mankind; the enemy hath &s;own an evil &s;eed, and in many it hath taken root, and &s;prang up above the good &s;eed, even among tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ing <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> it&s;elf; and from hence ari&s;eth and groweth all the evil will, envy, hatred, &s;trife, cruelty, violence, blood-&s;hed, wars and murders, in the world, and till the head of this evil &s;eed be not only brui&s;ed, by the promi&s;ed &s;eed which God hath &s;owed, but rooted out al|&s;o of the heart of man, all the&s;e things will grow up; the&s;e evil effects can never cea&s;e till the cau&s;e be removed, and taken away, as the true <HI>Chri&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tan</HI> knoweth right well by experience.</P>
<P>Now the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> indeed, as they live and abide in this pure <HI>internal principle</HI> of light, life, &s;pirit, and truth, they have unity one with another, and fellow&s;hip with God; they are the bre|thren who&s;e living together in unity is comely to behold, who have the one mind, one heart; and have their minds and hearts always governed, ruled and ordered by the good &s;pirit of God: As every one lives and keeps this order, and under this heavenly government, they cannot choo&s;e but live together in unity, in love, in good-will, in peace, heavenly concord and agreement, every one within him&s;elf, with God, and with each other, and in love to all mankind; here is the end of &s;trife, wars and fightings come unto, both within and without; and this is the time and &s;tate wherein <HI>in&s;truments of war and cruelty</HI> are turned into <HI>in&s;truments of nece&s;&s;ary u&s;e:</HI> And as they abide herein, they can learn war no more, according to the ble&s;&s;ed fight and prophe&s;y of <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> that evangelical Prophet.

<P>Now the way to everla&s;ting happine&s;s is but one, both to <HI>Jew</HI> and <HI>Gentile;</HI> which way is Chri&s;t, who is the wi&s;dom and power of God, the truth and the life; and the appearance of this Chri&s;t, of God, is within men, in their hearts: Its fir&s;t ap|pearance is as a light &s;hining in darkne&s;s, and as a pure &s;pot|le&s;s &s;pirit, that con&s;enteth to no evil but reproveth and con|vinceth all that are found in it; and to this light or &s;pirit, all who write or &s;peak for God, and the good of mankind, do turn and direct the minds of men, and endeavour to per&s;uade them to regard its reproofs of in&s;truction, as being the way to life, and to obey its coun&s;el and teaching, as the only means of &s;alvation, and way of returning to the rock from whence they were hewn, and to the hole of the pit from whence they were digged, to their habitation and dwelling place in God again, and many thou&s;ands in this i&s;land and other places, can give te&s;timony that this is the only way and means God hath or|dained for the recovery, return, and re&s;toration of lo&s;t man; and that all other ways and means which they had been weary|ing them&s;elves in, availed nothing; but walking in this hea|venly way, the light, the &s;pirit and grace of God within, and learning of the anointing within, they witne&s;s &s;alvation come to their hou&s;e, and to &s;urround them as walls and bulwarks, and to witne&s;s the fulfilling of that divine prophey, <NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. xxxii. 18. and Ver&s;, 3, 4</NOTE> <HI>My peo|ple &s;hall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">well in a peaceable habitation, and in &s;ure dwellings, and in quiet re&s;ting places.

<P>But none enjoy this ble&s;&s;ed e&s;tate, nor inhabit this heavenly dwelling-place, but as their minds come truly to be exerci&s;ed by and in the light of the Lord; and that by walking and abiding therein, come to have their minds e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;ettled and &s;tayed upon him who is indeed the alone &s;tay of his peo|ple. and rock of his inheritance.</P>
<P>And nothing can be found in the heavens above, nor in the earth beneath, that is able to &s;atisfy or &s;tay the mind of man,

<P>But all that walk not, nor abide and per&s;evere therein, after they are come into it, never attain to that ble&s;&s;ed end of its appearing and &s;hining to them; for a bare knowledge of the truth, and a profe&s;&s;ion of the light and &s;pirit of God within, if they walk not in it, and are not guided and led by it, it avails nothing, but rather draws down fierce wrath and vengeance upon the head of &s;uch, who know their ma&s;ter's will and do it not, who talk and profe&s;s well, but are found <HI>doing evil,</HI> and thereby lay a <HI>&s;tumbling-block</HI> in the way of the blind, and cau&s;e the way of truth to be <HI>evil &s;poken</HI> of, and the name of the Lord, by which be hath made him&s;elf known in this age, to be <HI>bla&s;|phemed,</HI> by rea&s;on of their <HI>ungedly deeds,</HI> under a profe&s;&s;ion of godline&s;s, and cloak of righteou&s;ne&s;s; &s;uch their <HI>damnation</HI> &s;lum|bereth not.</P>
