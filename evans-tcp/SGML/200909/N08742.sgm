<P>ALL that has been &s;aid by the greate&s;t &s;aints and dying men, when the fulle&s;t of light and divine knowledge, of the nece&s;|&s;ity of piety, of the excellency of virtue, of our duty to God, of the vanity of worldly enjoyments; and all the maxims of the wi&s;e&s;t philo&s;ophers, when in their highe&s;t &s;tate of wi&s;dom, are proper objects of meditation for the &s;erious minded, and ought, particu|larly, to con&s;titute the daily le&s;&s;ons of youth|ful minds. Such was the education of the youth who attended Plato and Socrates; their every day's in&s;truction were &s;o many lectures upon the nature of man, his true end, and the right u&s;e of his faculties. Now as Chri|&s;tianity has &s;et every thing that is rea&s;onable, wi&s;e, holy and de&s;irable, in its true point of light, &s;o it might well be expected, that the education of the youth &s;hould be as much bettered and amended by Chri&s;tianity, as the faith and doctrines of religion are. But, alas, our modern education is not of this kind, whatever way of life we intend the youth for, we apply to the fire of their minds, and ex|hort them to improvement from corrupt mo|tives. We generally &s;tir them to action from principles of covetou&s;ne&s;s, or a de&s;ire of di|&s;tinction, that they may accumulate wealth, excel others, and &s;hine in the eyes of the world. We repeat and inculcate the&s;e mo|tives upon them, till they think it a part of their duty to make gain and worldly di&s;tinc|tion the chief object of their de&s;ire. That
<PB N="3" REF="011175_0003_0F862BA0264AFE68">this is generally the nature of the education of our &s;ons, is too plain to need any proof. And it is much to be lamented that our daugh|ters, who&s;e right education is of the utmo&s;t importance to human life, &s;hould not only be brought up in pride, but in the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t contemptible part of it; &s;uch as a fond|ne&s;s for their per&s;ons, a de&s;ire of beauty, and a love of dre&s;s; and indeed almo&s;t every thing they meet with &s;eems to con&s;pire to make them think of little el&s;e. And after all this we complain of the pernicious effects that pride and covetou&s;ne&s;s have in the world; we wonder to &s;ee grown per&s;ons actuated and go|vern'd by the&s;e pernicious principles, not con&s;idering that they were all the time of their youth called upon to form their actions and in|du&s;try upon the &s;ame principles. An educa|tion under Plato and Socrates had no other end, but to teach youth to think, judge, act and follow &s;uch rules of life as Plato and So|crates u&s;ed, and is it not our indi&s;pen&s;able duty to u&s;e our be&s;t endeavour that the end of a chri&s;tian education, may be to teach our youth how to think and judge, and act, and live agreeable to the precepts and practice of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>The Uncertainty of a DEATH|BED REPENTANCE, illu|&s;trated under the Character of PENITENS.</HEAD>
<P>PENITENS was a bu&s;y notable trade&s;|man, and very pro&s;perous in his deal|ings, but died in the <HI>thirty-fifth</HI> year of his age.</P>
<P>A little before his death, when the doctors had given him over, &s;ome of his neighbours came one evening to &s;ee him; at which time he &s;pake thus to them:</P>
<P>I &s;ee, &s;ays he, my friends, the tender con|cern you have for me, by the grief that ap|pears in your countenances, and I know the thoughts that you now have about me. You think how melancholy a ca&s;e it is, to &s;ee &s;o young a man, and in &s;uch flouri&s;hing bu&s;ine&s;s, deliver'd up to death. And, perhaps, had I vi&s;ited any of you in my condition, I &s;hould have had the &s;ame thoughts of you.</P>
<P>But now, my friends, my thoughts are no more like your thoughts, than my condition is like yours.</P>
<P>It is no trouble to me now to think, that I am to die young, or before I have rais'd an e&s;tate.</P>
<P>The&s;e things are now &s;unk into &s;uch meet <HI>nothings,</HI> that I have no name little enough to call them by. For if in a few days, or hours, I am to leave this carca&s;e to be buried in the
<PB N="5" REF="011175_0005_0F862BA22AC29438">earth, and to find my&s;elf either for ever happy in the favour of God, or eternally &s;eparated from all light and peace, can any words &s;uffi|ciently expre&s;s the littlene&s;s of every thing el&s;e?</P>
<P>Is there any dream like the dream of life, in which we are amu&s;ed with vain and empty things? whil&s;t we are neglecting and di&s;re|garding that which is &s;ub&s;tantially valuable. Is there any folly like the folly of mo&s;t men and women, who think them&s;elves too wi&s;e, and are too bu&s;y to hearken to the voice of Je&s;us Chri&s;t calling in the heart? which, if carefully attended to, would occa&s;ion the&s;e &s;erious re|flections; but for want of attending to this divine in&s;tructor, that enemy of mankind the Devil, is &s;uffered to fill our minds with unrea|&s;onable affections and fooli&s;h opinions; &s;o that when we con&s;ider death as a mi&s;ery, we only think of it as a mi&s;erable &s;eparation from the enjoyments of this life. We &s;eldom mourn over an old man that dies rich, but we lament the young, that are taken away in the pro|gre&s;s of their fortune. You your&s;elves look upon me with pity, not that I am going un|prepar'd to meet the Judge of the quick and the dead, but that I am to leave a pro&s;perous trade in the flower of my life.</P>
<P>This is the wi&s;dom of our manly thoughts. And yet what folly of the &s;illie&s;t children is &s;o great as this?</P>
<P>For what is there mi&s;erable or dreadful in death, but the con&s;equences of it? When a man is dead, what does any thing &s;ignify to
<PB N="6" REF="011175_0006_0F862BA267E8DBA0">him, but the &s;tate he is then in?</P>
<P>Our poor friend <HI>Lepidus</HI> dy'd, you know, as he was dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf for a <HI>fea&s;t;</HI> do you think it is now part of his trouble, that he did not live till that entertainment was over? <HI>Fea&s;ts,</HI> and <HI>bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> and <HI>plea&s;ures,</HI> and <HI>enjoyments,</HI> &s;eem great things to us, whil&s;t we think of nothing el&s;e; but as &s;oon as we add death to them, they all &s;ink into an equal littlene&s;s; and the &s;oul, that is &s;eparated from the body, no more laments the lo&s;s of <HI>bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> than the lo&s;ing of a <HI>fea&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>If I am now going into the joys of GOD, could there be any rea&s;on to grieve, that this happen'd to me before I was forty years of age? could it be a &s;ad thing to go to Heaven, before I had made a few more bargains or &s;tood a little longer behind a counter?</P>
<P>And if I am to go among&s;t lo&s;t &s;pirits, could there be any rea&s;on to be content, that this did not happen to me till I was old, and full of <HI>riches?</HI></P>
<P>If good Angels were ready to receive my &s;oul, could it be any grief to me, that I was dying upon a <HI>poor bed</HI> in a <HI>garret?</HI></P>
<P>And if GOD has delivered me up to evil &s;pirits, to be dragg'd by them to places of torments, could it be any comfort to me, that they found me upon a <HI>bed of &s;tate?</HI></P>
<P>When you are as near death as I am, you will know, that all the different &s;tates of life, whether of youth or age, <HI>riches</HI> or <HI>poverty, great|ne&s;s</HI> or <HI>meane&s;s,</HI> &s;ignify no more to you, than
<PB N="7" REF="011175_0007_0F862BA335D697C0">whether you die in a <HI>poor</HI> or <HI>&s;tately</HI> apartment.</P>
<P>The greatne&s;s of tho&s;e things which follow death, makes all that goes before it &s;ink into <HI>nothing.</HI></P>
<P>Now that <HI>judgment</HI> is the next thing that I look for, and everla&s;ting happine&s;s or mi&s;ery is come &s;o near me, all the enjoyments and pro&s;perities of life &s;eem as vain and in&s;ig|nificant, and to have no more to do with my happine&s;s, than the cloaths that I wore before I could &s;peak.</P>
<P>But, my friends, how am I &s;urpriz'd, that I have not always had the&s;e thoughts? How an I &s;urpriz'd to find, that for want of yield|ing obedience, to that degree of light and grace, with which God hath enlightened? the words of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour have been ful|filled in me, darkne&s;s has been &s;uffered to come over me, and the&s;e great things have been hid from me; for what is there in the terrors of death, in the vanities of life, or the nece&s;&s;i|ties of piety, but what I might have as ea&s;ily and fully &s;een in any part of my life?</P>
<P>What a &s;trange thing is it, that a little <HI>health,</HI> or the poor bu&s;ine&s;s of a <HI>&s;hop,</HI> &s;hould keep us &s;o &s;en&s;ele&s;s of the&s;e great things, that are com|ing &s;o fa&s;t upon us!</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as you came into my chamber, I was thinking with my&s;elf, what numbers of &s;ouls there are now in the world, in my condition at this very time, &s;urpriz'd with a &s;ummons to the other world; &s;ome taken from their <HI>&s;hops</HI> and <HI>farms,</HI> others from their <HI>&s;ports</HI> and <HI>plea&s;ures,</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="011175_0008_0F862BA3E4B8E100">the&s;e at <HI>&s;uits at law,</HI> tho&s;e at <HI>gaming-tables,</HI> and all &s;eiz'd at an hour when they thought nothing of it; frighted at the approach of death, confounded at the vanity of all their labours, de&s;igns and projects, a&s;toni&s;h'd at the folly of their pa&s;t lives, and not knowing which way to turn their thoughts, to find any com|fort. Their con&s;ciences flying in their faces, bringing all their &s;ins to their remembrance, tormenting them with the deepe&s;t convictions of their own folly, pre&s;enting them with the &s;ight of the angry Judge, the worm that never dies, the fire that is never quench'd, the gates of hell, the powers of darkne&s;s, and the bitter pains of eternal death.</P>
<P>Oh my friends! ble&s;s God that you are not of this number, that you have time and &s;trength to employ your&s;elves in &s;uch works of piety, as may bring you peace at the la&s;t.</P>
<P>And take this along with you, that there is nothing but a life of great piety, or a death of great &s;tupidity, that can keep off the&s;e appre|hen&s;ions.</P>
<P>Had I now a thou&s;and worlds, I would give them all for one year more, that I might pre|&s;ent unto God, one year of &s;uch devotion and good works, as I never before &s;o much as in|tended.</P>
<P>You perhaps, when you con&s;ider that I have liv'd free from &s;candal and debauchery, and in the communion of the Church, wonder to &s;ee me &s;o fall of remor&s;e and &s;elf-condemnation at the approach of death.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="011175_0009_0F862BA6769436B8">
But, alas! what a poor thing is it, to have liv'd only free from <HI>murder, theft</HI> and <HI>adultery,</HI> which is all that I can &s;ay for my&s;elf.</P>
<P>You know indeed, that I have never been reckon'd a <HI>&s;ot,</HI> but you are at the &s;ame time witne&s;&s;es, and have been frequent com|panions of my <HI>intemperance, &s;en&s;uality,</HI> and great <HI>indulgence.</HI> And if I am now going to a judg|ment, where nothing will be rewarded but <HI>good works,</HI> I may well be concern'd, that tho' I am no <HI>&s;ot,</HI> yet I have no <HI>Chri&s;tian &s;obriety</HI> to plead for me.</P>
<P>It is true, I have liv'd in the communion of the Church, and generally frequented its wor|&s;hip and &s;ervice on <HI>Sundays,</HI> when I was neither too <HI>idle,</HI> or not otherwi&s;e di&s;pos'd of by my <HI>bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> and <HI>plea&s;ures.</HI> But then my confor|mity to the publick wor&s;hip has been rather a thing of cour&s;e, than any real intention of doing that which the &s;ervice of the Church &s;uppo&s;es; had it not been &s;o, I had been oftner at Church, more devout when there, and more fearful of ever neglecting it.</P>
<P>But the thing that now &s;urprizes me above all wonders, is this, that I never had &s;o much as a <HI>general intention</HI> of living up to the piety of the Go&s;pel. This never &s;o much as enter'd into my heart. I never once in my life con&s;ider'd whether I was living as the laws of Religion direct, or whether my way of life was &s;uch, as would procure me the mercy of God at this hour.</P>
<P>And can it be thought, that I have kept the
<PB N="10" REF="011175_0010_0F862BA70AA3C528">Go&s;pel terms of &s;alvation, without ever &s;o much as <HI>intending</HI> in any &s;erious deliberate manner either to know them, or keep them? Can it be thought, that I have plea&s;ed God with &s;uch a life as he requires, tho' I have liv'd without ever con&s;idering, what he requires, or how much I have perform'd? How ea&s;y a thing would &s;alvation be, if it could fall into my carele&s;s hands, who have never had &s;o much &s;erious thoughts about it, as about any one common bargain that I have made?</P>
<P>In the bu&s;ine&s;s of life I have u&s;ed prudence and reflection, I have done every thing by rules and methods. I have been glad to con|ver&s;e with men of experience and judgment, to &s;ind out the rea&s;ons why &s;ome fail, and others &s;ucceed in any bu&s;ine&s;s. I have taken no &s;tep in trade but with great care and caution, con&s;idering every advantage or danger that attended it. I have always had my eye upon the main end of bu&s;ine&s;s, and have &s;tudy'd all the ways and means of being a gainer by all that I undertook.</P>
<P>But what is the rea&s;on that I have brought none of the&s;e tempers to Religion? What is the rea&s;on that I, who have &s;o often talk'd of the nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>rules</HI> and <HI>methods,</HI> and <HI>diligence</HI> in worldly bu&s;ine&s;s, have all this while never once thought of any rules, or methods, or managements, to carry me on in a life of piety?</P>
<P>Do you think any thing can a&s;toni&s;h, and confound a dying man like this? What pain do you think a man mu&s;t feel, when his con&s;cience
<PB N="11" REF="011175_0011_0F862BA7AEAEA348">lays all this folly to his charge when it &s;hall &s;hew him how regular, exact, and wi&s;e he has been in &s;mall matters, that are pa&s;&s;ed away like a dream, and how &s;tupid and &s;en&s;ele&s;s he has liv'd, without any reflection, without any rules, in things of &s;uch eternal moment, as no heart can &s;ufficiently conceive them!</P>
<P>Had I only my <HI>frailties</HI> and <HI>imperfections</HI> to lament at this time, I &s;hould lye here humbly tru&s;ting in the mercies of God. But alas! how can I call a general di&s;regard, and a thorough neglect of all religious improvement, a <HI>frailty</HI> or <HI>imperfection;</HI> when it was as much in my power to have been exact, and careful, and diligent in a cour&s;e of piety, as in the bu&s;ine&s;s of my <HI>trade.</HI></P>
<P>I could have call'd in as many helps, have practi&s;ed as many rules, and been taught as many certain methods of holy living, as of thriving in my &s;hop, had I but &s;o <HI>intended</HI> and <HI>de&s;ir'd</HI> it.</P>
<P>Oh my friends! a carele&s;s life, unconcern'd and unattentive to the duties of Religion, is &s;o without all excu&s;e, &s;o unworthy of the mercy of God, &s;uch a &s;hame to the &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on of our minds, that I can hardly conceive a greater puni&s;hment, than for a man to be thrown into the &s;tate that I am in, to reflect upon it.</P>
<P><HI>Penitens</HI> was here going on, but had his mouth &s;topp'd by a <HI>convul&s;ion,</HI> which never &s;uffer'd him to &s;peak any more. He lay con|vuls'd about twelve hours, and then gave up the gho&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="011175_0012_0F862BA8F082A3E0">
Now if every <HI>reader</HI> would imagine this <HI>Pe|nitens</HI> to have been &s;ome particular acquaintance or relation of his, and fancy that he &s;aw and heard all that is here de&s;crib'd, that he &s;tood by his bed-&s;ide when his poor friend lay in &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s and agony, lamenting the folly of his pa&s;t life, it would in all probability teach him &s;uch wi&s;dom as never enter'd into his heart before.

<HEAD>Chri&s;tian Admonitions from a pious Father to his Children.</HEAD>
<P>THE little time that you have been in the world, my children, you have &s;pent wholly with me; and my love and tenderne&s;s to you, has made you look upon me as your only friend and benefactor, and the cau&s;e of all the comfort and plea&s;ure that you enjoy. But, my children, you are now in the hands, and under the tender care of a much greater father and friend than I am, who&s;e love to you is far greater than mine, and from whom you receive &s;uch ble&s;&s;ings as no mortal can give.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="011175_0013_0F862BA9B81934C0">
That God whom I daily call upon to ble&s;s both you and me, and all mankind; who&s;e wonderous acts are recorded in tho&s;e &s;criptures which you con&s;tantly read.</P>
<P>That God who created the heavens and the earth, who brought a flood on the old world; who &s;aved Noah in the ark; who was the God of Abraham, I&s;aac and Jacob, whom Job ble&s;|&s;ed and prai&s;ed in the greate&s;t afflictions; who delivered the I&s;raelites out of the hands of the Egyptians; who was the protector of righteous Jo&s;eph, Mo&s;es, Jo&s;hua and holy Daniel; who &s;ent his &s;on Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to redeem mankind; and gave his holy &s;pirit to be our leader, our comforter and director in the path of righteou&s;|ne&s;s and truth.</P>
<P>This God who has done all the&s;e great things; who has created &s;o many millions of men; who lived and died before you were born, with whom the &s;pirits of good men that are departed this life now live, whom infinite numbers of angels now wor&s;hip in Heaven; this great God is your loving father and friend, your good creator and nouri&s;her, from whom, and not from me, ye receive your being.</P>
<P>You &s;ee, my children, this wide and large firmament over our heads, where the &s;un and moon, and all the &s;tars appear in their turns: If you were to be carried up to any of the&s;e bodies at this va&s;t di&s;tance from us, you would &s;till di&s;cover others as much above you, as the &s;tars that you &s;ee here are above the earth. Were you to go up or down, Ea&s;t or We&s;t,
<PB N="14" REF="011175_0014_0F862BA9EED3F5F8">North or South, you would find the &s;ame height without any top, and the &s;ame depth without any bottom.</P>
<P>And, my children, &s;o great is God, that all tho&s;e bodies added together, are but as a grain of &s;and in his &s;ight. And yet you are as much the care of this great God and father of all worlds, and all &s;pirits, as if he had no other children but you.</P>
<P>He numbers the hairs of your heads, watches over you &s;leeping and waking, and has pre|&s;erved you from a thou&s;and dangers, which neither you nor I know any thing of.</P>
<P>Therefore, my children, fear and wor&s;hip and love God. Your eyes indeed cannot &s;ee him, but every thing you &s;ee, are &s;o many marks of his power and pre&s;ence, and he his nearer to to you, than any thing that you can &s;ee.</P>
<P>Take him for your Lord, and father, and friend; look upon him as the fountain and cau&s;e of all the good that you have received through my hands, and reverence me only as the bearer and mini&s;ter of God's good things unto you. And he that ble&s;&s;ed my father be|fore I was born, will ble&s;s you when I am dead.</P>
<P>Your youth and little minds are only yet acquainted with my family, and therefore you think there is no happine&s;s out of it. But, my children, you belong to a greater family than mine, you are members of the family of this almighty father of all nations, who has created infinite orders of angels, and numberle&s;s
<PB N="15" REF="011175_0015_0F862BAAAA071C08">generations of men, to be fellow-members of one and the &s;ame &s;ociety in heaven.</P>
<P>You do well to reverence and obey my au|thority, becau&s;e God has given me power over you, to bring you up in his fear, and to do for you, as the holy fathers recorded in &s;crip|ture did for their children, who are now in re&s;t and peace with God.</P>
<P>I &s;hall in a &s;hort time die, and leave <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 span"> God and your&s;elves; and if God forgiveth my &s;ins I &s;hall go to his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and live among&s;t patriarchs and prophets, &s;aints and martyrs.</P>
<P>Let your thoughts often leave the&s;e gardens, the&s;e fields and farms, to contemplate upon God and heaven; to con&s;ider upon angels and the &s;pirits of good men living in light and glory.</P>
<P>God keepeth a book of life wherein all the actions of all men are written; your names are there my children, and when you die, this book will be laid open before men and angels, and according as your actions are there found, you will either be received to the hap|pine&s;s of tho&s;e holy men who have died before you, or be turned away among&s;t wicked &s;pirits, that are never to &s;ee God any more.</P>
<P>Never forget this book my children, for it is written, and it mu&s;t be open'd, you mu&s;t &s;ee it, and you mu&s;t be try'd by it: Strive there|fore to fill it with your good deeds, that the hand-writing of God may not appear again&s;t you.</P>
<P>God, my children, is all love, and wi&s;dom,
<PB N="16" REF="011175_0016_0F862BAB6E8B2170">and goodne&s;s; and every thing that he has made, and every action that he does, is the effect of them all. Therefore you cannot plea&s;e God, but &s;o far as you &s;trive to walk in love, wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>When you love that which God loves, you act with him, you join your&s;elves to him; and when you love what he di&s;likes, then you op|po&s;e him, and &s;eperate your&s;elves from him. This is the true and the right way, think what God loves, and do you love it with all your heart.</P>
<P>Next to this, love your neighbour, which is all the world, with &s;uch tenderne&s;s and affec|tion as you love your&s;elf.</P>
<P>Think how God loves all mankind, how merciful he is to them, how tender he is of them, how careful he pre&s;erves them, and then &s;trive to love the world as God loves it. God would have all men to be happy, therefore do you will, and de&s;ire the &s;ame.</P>
<P>As God has created all things for the com|mon good of all men, &s;o let that part of them, which falls to your &s;hare, be employed as God would have all employed, for the common good of all.</P>
<P>Therefore do good my children, fir&s;t of all to tho&s;e that mo&s;t de&s;erve it, but remember to do good to all. The greate&s;t &s;inners receive daily in&s;tances of God's goodne&s;s towards them, he nouri&s;hes and pre&s;erves them, that they may repent, and return to him; do you therefore imitate God, and think no one too bad to re|ceive your relief and kindne&s;s, when you &s;ee that he wants it.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="011175_0017_0F862BAC35ADA360">
And my children con&s;ider, this as a mo&s;t principal thing which I &s;hall remember you of, as long as I live with you; hate and de&s;pi&s;e all human glory, for it is nothing el&s;e but human folly. It is the greate&s;t &s;nare, and the greate&s;t betrayer, that you can po&s;&s;ibly admit into your heart.</P>
<P>Love humility in all its in&s;tances, practi&s;e it in all its parts; for it is the mo&s;t noble &s;tate of the &s;oul of man; it will &s;et your heart and affections right towards God, and fill you with every temper that is tender and affectionate to|wards men.</P>
<P>And above all, mark this, never do any thing through &s;trife, or envy, or emulation, or vain glory. Never do any thing in order to excel other people, but in order to plea&s;e God, and becau&s;e it is his will, that you &s;hould do every thing in the be&s;t manner that you can.</P>
<P>When you come to be more conver&s;ant with the world, and &s;ee what cu&s;toms, and plea&s;ures, and troubles and projects, employ the hearts and time of mankind, you will &s;carce believe that things can be as I have told you. But don't let this affect you, for the devil the god of this world has &s;o blinded the eyes of tho&s;e who refu&s;e to comply with the calls of grace, that it may, indeed, be &s;aid that the world is in a dream, and that few people are awake in it: We fancy that we fall into darkne&s;s when we die; but, alas, we are mo&s;t of us in the dark till then; and the eyes of our &s;ouls only begin to &s;ee when our bodily eyes are clo&s;ing.</P>

For this rea&s;on, my di&s;cour&s;es with you have been to acquaint you with your&s;elves, and to accu&s;tom you to &s;uch books and devotion as may be&s;t in&s;truct you in this greate&s;t of all knowledge.</P>
<P>When I tell you that you are all of you &s;pirits: I don't mean that you have not bodies that want meat and drink, and &s;leep and cloathing, but that all that de&s;erves to be cal|led you, is nothing el&s;e but &s;pirit.</P>
<P>A being, &s;piritual and rational in its nature, that is made in the image of God to live for ever, never to cea&s;e any more, but to enjoy life, and rea&s;on, and knowledge and happine&s;s in the pre&s;ence of God, and the &s;ociety of an|gels and glorious &s;pirits to all eternity.</P>
<P>Every thing that you call yours, be&s;ides this &s;pirit, is but like your cloathing; &s;omething that is only to be u&s;ed for a while, and then to end, and die, and wear away, and to &s;ignify no more to you, than the cloathing and bodies of other people.</P>
<P>You are not only in this manner &s;pirits, but you are fallen &s;pirits, that began your life in a &s;tate of corruption and di&s;order, full of tem|pers and pa&s;&s;ions, that blind and darken the rea&s;on of your minds, and incline you to that which is hurtful.</P>
<P>And ob&s;erve this, my children, as a mo&s;t &s;olemn con&s;ideration, That in this fallen con|dition you are utterly unable, by any power of your own, to re&s;tore your&s;elves. It is God alone, by his almighty power, who can, and
<PB N="19" REF="011175_0019_0F862BADA4BEB918">who is de&s;irous to, perfect this great work in you.</P>
<P>Your bodies are not only poor and peri&s;h|ing like your cloaths, but they are like infected cloaths, that &s;ill you with ill di&s;ea&s;e and di&s;tem|pers, which oppre&s;s the &s;oul with &s;ickly appe|tites and vain cravings. So that all of us are like two beings, that have as it were two hearts within us: With the one we &s;ee, and ta&s;te, and admire rea&s;on, purity and holine&s;s; with the other we incline to pride, vanity and &s;en&s;ual delights.</P>
<P>This internal war we always feel within us more or le&s;s, and if you would know the one thing nece&s;&s;ary to all the world, it is this, that by a con&s;tant and fervent application to God for divine help, we may thro' the effectual workings of the redeeming power of our Sa|viour Je&s;us Chri&s;t in our hearts, be enabled to pre&s;erve and perfect all that is rational, holy and divine within us, and mortify, remove and de&s;troy all that vanity, pride and &s;en&s;uality, which &s;prings from the corruption of our nature.</P>
<P>You &s;ee then your &s;tate my children; you are by the help of divine grace, to honour, improve and perfect the &s;pirit that is within you; to pre&s;erve it from the errors and vanities of the world; to &s;ave it from tho&s;e fal&s;e de|lights, and &s;en&s;ual tempers which the body tempts it with: That you may ta&s;te, and reli&s;h and de&s;ire that eternal &s;tate, which is to begin when this life ends.</P>

<P>Strive to do every thing that is prai&s;e worthy, but do nothing in order to be prai&s;ed; nor think of any reward for all your labour of love and virtue, till Chri&s;t cometh with all his holy angels.</P>
<P>And above all, my children, have a care of vain and proud thoughts of your own virtue: For as &s;oon as ever people live different from the common way of the world, and de&s;pi&s;e its vanities, the devil repre&s;ents to their minds the height of their own perfections, and is con|tent they &s;hould excel in good works, provided that he can make them proud of them.</P>

<P>THAT grand enemy of mankind, the de|vil, is very ju&s;tly called in &s;cripture the prince and god of this world, for indeed he has great power in it, many of its rules, and princi|ples being invented by this evil &s;pirit, the fa|ther of all lies and fal&s;hood, to &s;eperate us from God, and prevent our return to happine&s;s: For, according to the &s;pirit and vogue of this world, who&s;e corrupt air we have all breathed, there are many things that pa&s;s for great and ho|nourable, and mo&s;t de&s;irable, which yet are &s;o far from being-&s;o, that our true greatne&s;s and honour con&s;i&s;ts in not de&s;iring them. To a|bound in wealth, to have fine hou&s;es and rich
<PB N="23" REF="011175_0023_0F862BB2E9F349D0">cloaths, to be attended with &s;plendor and equi|page, to be beautiful in our per&s;ons, to have titles of dignity, to be above our fellow crea|tures, to be looked on with admiration, to overcome our enemies with power, to heap up trea&s;ures upon earth, to add hou&s;e to hou&s;e and field to field, and delight our&s;elves in the mo&s;t co&s;tly manner, the&s;e are the great, the honourable, the de&s;irable things, to which the &s;pirit of the world turns the eyes of mo&s;t peo|ple. And many a man is afraid of &s;tanding &s;till, and not engaging in the pur&s;uit of the&s;e things, le&s;t the &s;ame world &s;hould take him for a fool.</P>
<P>Yet the hi&s;tory of the go&s;pel, is chiefly the hi&s;tory of Chri&s;t's conque&s;t over this &s;pirit of the world, and the number of true Chri&s;tians, is only the number of tho&s;e who, following the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, have lived contrary to this &s;pirit of the world.</P>
<P>This is the mark of Chri&s;tianity, <HI>Who&s;oever is born of God overcometh the world.</HI> 1 John v. 4. <HI>Set your affections on things above, and not on things on earth, for ye are dead, and your life is hid with Chri&s;t in God.</HI> Col. iii. 2. <HI>Love not the world, nor the things of the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him; for all that is in the world, the lu&s;t of the fle&s;h, the lu&s;t of the eyes, and the pride of life is not of the Father; but is of the world.</HI> 1 John ii. 15. <HI>Know ye not that the friend&s;hip of the world is enmi|ty with God, who&s;oever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.</HI> James iv. 4. <HI>Be not

<P>This is the language of the whole new te&s;ta|ment. You are to be dead to the world, and to live a new life in Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord. But notwith&s;tanding the clearness and plainne&s;s of the&s;e doctrines by which believers in Chri&s;t are required thus to renounce the world, yet great part of the chri&s;tians live and die &s;laves to the cu&s;toms and tempers of the world. <HI>Learn of me,</HI> &s;aith our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, <HI>for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you &s;hall find re&s;t to your &s;ouls.</HI> Matth. xi. 29. Now this meek, this lowly &s;tate, that con&s;titutes the true re&s;t of the &s;oul, cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t in any mind, but &s;o far as it is thus dead to the world, and has parted with the de&s;ires of enjoying its riches, plea|&s;ures and honours. So that in order to be truly humble, you mu&s;t unlearn all the&s;e notions, which you have been all your life learning from this corrupt &s;pirit of the world. You can make no &s;tand again&s;t the a&s;&s;aults of pride, the meek affections of humility can have no place in your &s;ouls, till you &s;top the power of the world over you, and re&s;olve again&s;t a blind obedience to its laws. And when you are once advanced thus far, as to be able to &s;tand &s;till in the torrent of worldly fa&s;hions, and opinions and examine the worth and value of things, which are mo&s;t admired and valued in the world, you have gone a great way in the gaining of your freedom, and have laid a good foundation for the amendment of your heart. Think upon

<P>Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t <HI>gave him&s;elf for our &s;ins, that he might deliver us from this pre|&s;ent evil world.</HI> Gal. i. 4. Chri&s;tianity therefore implieth a deliverance from this world; and he that profe&s;&s;eth it, profe&s;&s;eth to live contrary to every thing, and every temper, that is peculiar to this evil world. The apo&s;tle John declareth this oppo&s;ition to the world in this manner: <HI>They are of the world, therefore &s;peak they of the world, and the world heareth them: We are of God, &amp;c.</HI> 1 John iv. 5. This is the de&s;cription of the fol|lowers of Chri&s;t; and it is proof enough, that no people are to be reckon'd chri&s;tians in reali|ty, who in their hearts and tempers belong to this world. <HI>We know,</HI> &s;aith the &s;ame apo&s;tle, <HI>that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedne&s;s.</HI> Chap. v. 19. Chri&s;tians therefore can no farther know that they are of God, than
<PB N="26" REF="011175_0026_0F862BB53102F388">&s;o far as they know they are not of the world, that is, that they don't live according to the ways and &s;pirit of the world. And he is only of God, or born of God, in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who has overcome this world, that is, who has cho&s;en to live by faith, and govern his actions by the principles of a wi&s;dom revealed from God, by Chri&s;t Je&s;us. <HI>They are not of this World, as I am not of this World,</HI> &s;ays our ble&s;|&s;ed Saviour. This is the &s;tate of Chri&s;tianity with regard to this world, the profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tians requiring them to live as citizens of the new Jeru&s;alem, and to have their conver|&s;ation in heaven. If you are not thus out of, and contrary to the world, you want the di|&s;tingui&s;hing mark of Chri&s;tianity; you don't belong to Chri&s;t, but by being out of the world, as he was out of it. We may deceive our&s;elves, if we plea&s;e, with vain and &s;oft|ning comments upon the&s;e words; but they are, and will be under&s;tood in their fir&s;t &s;im|plicity, and plainne&s;s, by every one that reads them in the &s;ame &s;pirit, that our ble&s;&s;ed Lord &s;poke them. And to under&s;tand them in any lower, le&s;s &s;ignificant meaning, is to let carnal wi&s;dom explain away that doctrine, by which it&s;elf was to be de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour &s;uffered, and was a &s;a|crifice, to make our &s;uffering, and &s;acrifice of our&s;elves fit to be received by God. And we are to &s;uffer, to be crucified, to die, and to ri&s;e with Chri&s;t; or el&s;e his crucifixion, death, and re&s;urrection will profit us nothing. The ne|ce&s;&s;ity
<PB N="27" REF="011175_0027_0F862BB6739C5F30">of this conformity to all that Chri&s;t did, and &s;uffered upon our account is very plain from the whole tenor of &s;cripture. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> As to his &s;ufferings, this is the only condition of our being &s;aved by them. <HI>If we &s;uffer with him, we &s;hall al&s;o reign with him.</HI> 2 Tim. ii. 11. <HI>Se|condly,</HI> As to his crucifixion, <HI>Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him.</HI> Rom. vi. 6. Here you &s;ee Chri&s;t is not crucified in our &s;tead; but unle&s;s our old man be really cruci|fied with him, the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t will profit us nothing. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> As to the death of Chri&s;t, the conditions is this: <HI>If we be dead with Chri&s;t, we believe that we &s;hall al&s;o live with him,</HI> ver. 8. If therefore Chri&s;t be dead alone, if we are not dead with him, we are as &s;ure from this &s;crip|ture, that we &s;hall not live with him. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> As to the re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t, the &s;cripture &s;heweth us, how we are to partake of the be|nefit of it: <HI>If ye be ri&s;en with Chri&s;t, &s;eek tho&s;e things which are above, where Chri&s;t &s;itteth on the right hand of God.</HI> Col. iii. 1. It was for this rea&s;on, that the holy Je&s;us &s;aid of his di|&s;ciples, and in them of all true believers, <HI>They are not of this world, as I am not of this world.</HI> Becau&s;e all true believers conforming to the &s;ufferings, crucifixion, death, and re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t, live no longer after the &s;pirit and temper of this world, but their life is hid with Chri&s;t in God. This is the &s;tate of &s;eperation from the world, to which all orders of chri&s;|tians are called. They mu&s;t &s;o far renounce all worldly tempers, be &s;o far governed by the

<P>Even the ancient Philo&s;ophers began all their virtue in a total renunciation of the &s;pirit of this world; they &s;aw with the eyes of hea|ven, that darkne&s;s was not more contrary to light, than the &s;pirit and wi&s;dom of this world was contrary to divine wi&s;dom: Therefore they allowed of no progre&s;s in virtue, but &s;o far as a man had overcome him&s;elf, and the &s;pirit of this world. This gave a true &s;olidity to all their in&s;tructions, and proved them to be ma&s;ters of true wi&s;dom. But the doctrine of the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, the la&s;t, the highe&s;t, the mo&s;t fini&s;hing &s;troke given to the &s;pirit of this world, that &s;peaks more in one word, than all the philo&s;ophy of volumnious writers, is yet profe&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e, who are in more friend&s;hip with the world, than was allowed to the di&s;ci|ples of Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato or Epictetus. Nay, if tho&s;e ancient &s;ages were to &s;tart up a|mong&s;t us with their enlightened wi&s;dom, they would bid fair to be treated by the &s;ons of the go&s;pel, if not by &s;ome fathers of the church, as dreaming Enthu&s;ia&s;ts. But, this is a &s;tand|ing truth, the world can only love its own, and wi&s;dom can only be ju&s;tified of her children. The heaven-born Epictetus told one of his &s;cholars, <HI>That then he might fir&s;t look upon him&s;elf as having made &s;ome true proficiency in virtue,
<PB N="29" REF="011175_0029_0F862BB765D929C8">when the world took him for a fool;</HI> an oracle like that, which &s;aid, the wi&s;dom of this world is fooli&s;hne&s;s with God.</P>
<P>If you a&s;k what is the apo&s;ta&s;y of the&s;e la&s;t times, or whence is all the degeneracy of the pre&s;ent chri&s;tian church, it mu&s;t be placed to a wordly &s;pirit.

This is the great net, with which the devil becomes a fi&s;her of men; and be a&s;&s;ured of this, that every &s;on of man is in this net, till through and by the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t he breaks out of it.

If you tru&s;t to any kind or form of religious ob&s;ervances, to any kind of learning, or effort of human prudence, then I will tell you what your ca&s;e will be, you will overcome one temper of the world, only and merely by cleaving to another: For nothing can overcome or renounce the world, but &s;ingly and &s;olely the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t. Hence it is, that many learned men, with all the rich furniture of their brain, live and die &s;laves to the &s;pirit of this world, the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t is not the only thing that is the de&s;ire of their hearts, and therefore their learning only works in and with
<PB N="30" REF="011175_0030_0F862BB8782AB538">the &s;pirit of this world, and becomes it&s;elf no &s;mall part of the vanity of vanities.</P>
<P>Would you know the evil nature and effect of a &s;pirit given up to the world, and not &s;ub|jected to the &s;pirit of grace, you need only look at the ble&s;&s;ed effect of a continual &s;tate of watching, a continual humble application to God in the true &s;pirit of prayer, for the one goes downwards with the &s;ame &s;trength, as the other goes upwards, the one betroths, and weds to an earthly nature, with the &s;ame cer|tainty, as the other e&s;pou&s;es, and unites to Chri&s;t. The &s;pirit of continual watchings and prayer, is a pre&s;&s;ing forth of the &s;oul out of this earthly life, it is a &s;tretching with all its de&s;ire after the life of God, it is a leaving as far as it can, all its own &s;pirit, to receive a &s;pirit from above, to be one life, one love, one &s;pirit with Chri&s;t in God. This prayer, which is an emp|tying it&s;elf of all its own lu&s;ts and natural tem|pers, and an opening it&s;elf for the light and love of God to enter into it, is the prayer in the name of Chri&s;t, to which nothing is deni|ed; for the love which God bears to the &s;oul, is an eternal never cea&s;ing de&s;ire to open the birth of his holy word and &s;pirit in it, and &s;tays no longer than till the door of the heart open for him; and nothing does or can keep God out of the &s;oul, or hinder his union with it, but the de&s;ire of the heart turned from it. What the &s;oul de&s;ireth, that is the fewel of its &s;ire, and as its fewel is, &s;o is the flame of its life. As we &s;ow we &s;hall reap; if to the &s;pirit, we
<PB N="31" REF="011175_0031_0F862BB8F8E867B8">&s;hall reap life and peace; if to the fle&s;h, we &s;hall of the &s;le&s;h reap corruption. Wherever and in what&s;oever the will chu&s;eth to dwell and delight, that becometh the &s;oul's food, its cloathing and habitation. Since this is the ca&s;e, let us &s;top a while, let our hearing be turned into feeling. Let us con&s;ider, whether there is any thing in life, that de&s;erves a thought, but how to keep in a continual &s;tate of watch|ing and prayer, that we may attain to that purity of heart, which alone can &s;ee, find and po&s;&s;e&s;s God.</P>

<HEAD>A &s;hort account of the progre&s;s and effects of the Plague, the la&s;t time it &s;pread in the city of London, viz. in the year 1665.</HEAD>
<P>AMONGST the many calamities with which the Almighty is plea&s;ed to vi&s;it the children of men, in order to reduce them to a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of their own weakne&s;s and entire dependence upon him, there is &s;carce any that are more productive of true penitent hu|miliation, and of a &s;ight of what is really good and truly evil, than tho&s;e contagious di&s;tem|pers, which an offended God &s;ometimes &s;uffers to rage among&s;t the people. In the year 1665 the city of <HI>London</HI> was &s;orely vi&s;ited by the plague: An account of the progre&s;s and effects of that vi&s;itation was kept by a citizen who re|mained there during the whole time of the
<PB N="32" REF="011175_0032_0F862BB9AE6CF6C8">&s;ickne&s;s, and appears to have been candid and judicious in his remarks thereon. I tru&s;t my readers may, in a &s;hort de&s;cription of that me|morable judgment, meet with &s;uch le&s;&s;ons of be&s;t wi&s;dom, which nothing can &s;o effectually produce, as a clo&s;e and &s;erious conver&s;e with death and the grave. The introduction of this contagion in <HI>London</HI> was by &s;ome goods im|ported from <HI>Holland,</HI> which had been brought thither from the <HI>Levant.</HI> It fir&s;t broke out in the hou&s;e where tho&s;e goods were opened, from whence it &s;pread to other hou&s;es. In the fir&s;t. hou&s;e that was infected there died four per&s;ons: A neighbour who went to vi&s;it them returning home, gave the di&s;temper to her family, and died with all her hou&s;hold. The pari&s;h officers who were employed about the &s;ick per&s;ons be|ing al&s;o infected, the phy&s;icians perceived the danger, and, upon narrow in&s;pection, a&s;&s;ured, that it was indeed the plague with all its terri|fying particulars, and that it threatened a ge|neral infection. The people began now to be alarmed all over the town; the u&s;ual number of burials within the bills of mortality for a week were generally about 240 to 300, but from the 17th to the 24th Jan. the printed bill was 474. However this went off again, and the fro&s;t continuing very &s;evere till near the end of February, the bills decrea&s;ed again, and people began to look upon the danger as good as over; but in May the bills greatly increa&s;ed, and the weather becoming hot, the infection &s;pread again, in a dreadful manner.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="011175_0033_0F862BBAA769DFD0">
I lived, &s;ays the author, without Aldgate, and as the di&s;temper had not reached to that &s;ide of the city, our neighbourhood continued ea&s;y; but at the other end of the town the con&s;ternation was very great, and the nobility and gentry thronged out of the town with their families in an unu&s;ual manner; nothing was to be &s;een but waggons, carts and coaches with goods and people, and hor&s;e-men attending them, hurrying away; then empty waggons and carts appeared, who were apparently re|turning to fetch more people, be&s;ides innumer|able numbers of people on hor&s;eback, fitted out for travelling. This was a very melan|choly pro&s;pect; indeed there was nothing el&s;e of moment to be &s;een; it filled my mind with very &s;erious thoughts of the mi&s;ery that was coming upon the city, and the unhappy con|dition of tho&s;e that would be left in it. By the end of July the contagion had &s;pread and in|crea&s;ed to a great degree: Sorrow and &s;adne&s;s &s;at upon every face; and though &s;ome parts were not yet overwhelmed, all looked deeply concerned. <HI>London</HI> might well be &s;aid to be all in tears, the mourners did not go about the &s;treets, for nobody made a formal dre&s;s of mourning for their neare&s;t relations, but the voice of mourning was indeed heard in the &s;treets; the &s;hrieks of women and children at the windows and doors of their hou&s;es where their deare&s;t relations were dying, were &s;o fre|quent to be heard as we pa&s;&s;ed the &s;treets, that it was enough to pierce the &s;toute&s;t heart in
<PB N="34" REF="011175_0034_0F862BBB26C264D0">the world. Tears and lamentations were &s;een almo&s;t in every hou&s;e, e&s;pecially in the fir&s;t part of the vi&s;itation; for towards the latter end people did not &s;o much concern them&s;elves for the lo&s;s of their friends, expecting that them&s;elves &s;hould be &s;ummoned the next hour.</P>
<P>It was a time of very unhappy breaches a|mong&s;t us; in matters of religion, divi&s;ions and &s;eperate opinions prevailed; the Church of <HI>England</HI> was lately re&s;tored, and the Pre&s;|byterians and other profe&s;&s;ions had &s;et up their meetings for wor&s;hip, apart, in which they were frequently di&s;turbed, the government endeavouring to &s;uppre&s;s their meetings. But this dreadful vi&s;itation reconciled the different parties, and took away all manner of prejudice and &s;cruple from the people. But after the &s;ick|ne&s;s was over, that &s;pirit of charity &s;ub&s;ided, and things returned to their own channel again. Here we may ob&s;erve, that a nearer view of death would &s;oon reconcile men of good prin|ciples to one another, and that it is chiefly owing to our ea&s;y &s;ituations in life, and our putting the&s;e things far from us, that our breaches are formented, and that there is &s;o much prejudice and want of chri&s;tian charity and union among&s;t us. A clo&s;e view and conver&s;e with death, or with di&s;ea&s;es that threaten death, would &s;cum off the gall of our temper, remove our ani|mo&s;ities, and bring us to &s;ee with different eyes. On the other &s;ide of the grave we &s;hall all be brethren again.</P>
<P>The inns of court were now all &s;hut up,
<PB N="35" REF="011175_0035_0F862BBBE9BAFFA8">there was but few lawyers to be &s;een in the city, indeed there was no need of them, for quarrels and divi&s;ions about intere&s;t had cea&s;ed; every body was at peace.</P>
<P>It was al&s;o worthy of ob&s;ervation, as well as fruitful of in&s;truction, to ob&s;erve with what alacrity the people of all per&s;ua&s;ions embraced the opportunities they had of attending upon the publick wor&s;hip, and other appointed times of devotion, as humiliations, fa&s;tings and pub|lick confe&s;&s;ions of &s;ins, to implore the mercy of God, and avert the judgment which hung over their heads. The churches were &s;o thronged, that there was often no coming near, no, not to the very door of the large&s;t churches. There was al&s;o daily prayers appointed morn|ing and evening, at which the people attended with uncommon devotion.</P>
<P>All plays and interludes which had lately began to increa&s;e among&s;t us, were forbid to act; the gaming-tables, publick dancing-rooms and mu&s;ick-hou&s;es, which multiplied and be|gan to debauch the manners of the people, were &s;hut up and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, finding indeed no trade; for the minds of the people were generally humbled and agitated with other things, death was before their eyes, and every body began to think of their graves.</P>
<P>The infection &s;till gradually increa&s;ed till the middle of Augu&s;t, when there died a thou&s;and a day, by account of the weekly bills, though they never gave a full account by many thou|&s;ands; many of the pari&s;h officers were taken
<PB N="36" REF="011175_0036_0F862BBCF3F94088">&s;ick them&s;elves and died when their account was to be given in. The pari&s;h of Stepney alone had within the year, one hundred and &s;ix|teen &s;extons, grave-diggers and carriers of the dead, &amp;c. Indeed the work was not of a na|ture to allow them lei&s;ure to take an exact tale of the dead bodies, which were all thrown to|gether in the dark in a pit, to which no man could come near without the utmo&s;t peril.</P>
<P>I had, &s;ays the author, the care of my bro|ther's hou&s;e, which obliged me &s;ometimes to go abroad. In the&s;e walks I had di&s;mal &s;cenes before my eyes, as, particularly, of per&s;ons falling dead in the &s;treets, terrible &s;hrieks of women, who in their agonies would throw open their chamber-windows, and cry out in a di&s;mal &s;urpri&s;ing manner; it is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;crible the varicty of po&s;tures in which the pa&s;&s;ions of the poor people would expre&s;s them&s;elves. Pa&s;&s;ing through Token-Hou&s;e yard, of a &s;udden a ca&s;ement violently opened ju&s;t over my head, and a woman gave three frightful &s;creeches, and then cry'd: <HI>Oh! Death, Death, Death,</HI> which &s;truck me with horror and a chilne&s;s in my very blood. There was nobody to be &s;een in the whole &s;treet, neither did any window open, for people had no curi|o&s;ity now in any ca&s;e. I went on to pa&s;s into <HI>Bell-Alley,</HI> where there was a greater cry than that; I could hear women and children run &s;creaming about the rooms like di&s;tracted, when a garret-window opened, and &s;omebody from a window on the other &s;ide a&s;ked, <HI>What
<PB N="37" REF="011175_0037_0F862BBD6473C1B0">is the matter?</HI> Upon which it was an&s;wered, <HI>Oh Lord! my old ma&s;ter has hanged him&s;elf.</HI> The other a&s;ked again, <HI>Is he quite dead?</HI> And the fir&s;t an&s;wered, <HI>Ay, ay quite dead and cold.</HI> This per&s;on was a Deputy-Alderman and very rich. But this is but one in&s;tance; it is &s;carce credi|ble what dreadful ca&s;es happened in particular families every day. People in the rage of the di&s;temper or in the torment of the &s;welling, which was indeed intolerable, becoming raving and di&s;tracted, oftentimes laid violent hands upon them&s;elves, throwing them&s;elves out of windows, or breaking out of the hou&s;es, would dance naked about the &s;treets, not knowing one exta&s;y from another; others, if not pre|vented, would run directly down to the river, and plunge into the water. Some dying of mere grief as a pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;ome of fright and &s;urprize, without having received the infec|tion. It often pierced my very &s;oul, to hear the groans and cries of tho&s;e who were thus tormented; but this of the &s;wellings was ac|counted the mo&s;t promi&s;ing particular in the whole infection; for if the&s;e &s;wellings could be brought to break and run, the patient generally recovered. Whereas tho&s;e who were &s;truck with death at the beginning of the di&s;temper, and had &s;pots come upon them, often went about indifferent ea&s;y, till a little before they died, and &s;ome till the moment they dropt down; &s;uch would be taken &s;uddenly very &s;ick, and would run to &s;ome convenient place, or to their own hou&s;es if po&s;&s;ible, and there &s;it down, grow faint and die.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="011175_0038_0F862BC046A310F0">
Death did not now hover over every one's head only, but looked into their hou&s;es and chambers, and even &s;tared in their very faces; and though there was &s;ome &s;tupidity and dul|ne&s;s of mind, yet there was a great deal of ju&s;t alarm &s;ounded in the inmo&s;t &s;oul: Many con|&s;ciences were awakened; many hard hearts melted into tears; many a penitent confe&s;&s;ion was made of crimes long concealed. People might be heard even in the &s;treets as we pa&s;&s;ed along calling upon God for mercy, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and &s;aying: I have been a thief; I have been an adulterer; I have been a mur|derer, and the like; and none dur&s;t &s;top to make inquiry into &s;uch things, or to admini|&s;ter comfort to the poor creature, who in the angui&s;h both of &s;oul and body thus cried out. Many were the warnings that were then given by dying penitents to others, not to put off and delay their repentance to a day of di&s;tre&s;s, that &s;uch a time of calamity as this was no time for repentance. I wi&s;h &s;ays the author, I could repeat the very &s;ound of tho&s;e groans and ex|clamations that I heard from &s;ome poor dying creatures, when in the height of their agonies and di&s;tre&s;s, and that I could make him that reads this; hear as I imagine, I now hear them, for the &s;ound &s;eems &s;till to ring in my ears. In the beginning of September the number of burials increa&s;ing, the church-wardens of Ald|gate pari&s;h ordered a large pit to be dug, to hold all the dead which might die in a month, it was about forty feet long and &s;ixteen broad;
<PB N="39" REF="011175_0039_0F862BC1890CD178">&s;ome blamed the church-wardens for &s;uffering &s;uch a frightful gulf to be dug; neverthele&s;s in two weeks they had thrown more than eleven hundred bodies into it, when they were obliged to &s;ill it up, as the bodies were come within 6 feet of the &s;urface. My curio&s;ity drove me to go and &s;ee this pit, when there had been near four hundered people buried in it. I got admittance into the church-yard, by means of the &s;exton, who was a &s;en&s;ible, reli|gious man. He would have per&s;uaded me not to go, &s;aying, <HI>That it was indeed their duty to venture, and in it they might hope to be pre&s;erved; but that, as I had no apparent call, he thought, my curio&s;ity could not ju&s;tify my running that hazard.</HI> I told him, <HI>I had been pre&s;&s;ed in my mind to go, and that perhaps it might be an in&s;tructing &s;ight. Nay,</HI> &s;ays the good man, <HI>if you will venture upon that &s;core, in the name of</HI> God <HI>go in; it will be a &s;ermon to you, it may be the be&s;t you ever heard in your life.</HI> His di&s;cour&s;es had &s;hock'd my re&s;o|lution, and I &s;tood wavering for a good while; but ju&s;t then I heard the bell-men, and the cart, loaded with dead bodies, appearing, I went in. There was nobody, as I could perceive, at fir&s;t with the cart but the buriers, and the man that led the cart; but when they came to the pit, they &s;aw a man muffled in a cloak who appeared in great agony; the buriers immediately gather|ed about him, &s;uppo&s;ing he was one of tho&s;e poor delirious or de&s;perate creatures, that would &s;ometimes run to the pit, wrapt in blan|kets, and throw them&s;elves in, and as they
<PB N="40" REF="011175_0040_0F862BC2A0EB1FC0">&s;aid bury them&s;elves. When the buriers came to him, they &s;oon found he was neither de&s;perate nor di&s;tempered in mind, but one oppre&s;&s;ed with a dreadful weight of grief, having his wife and &s;everal children all in the cart, that was ju&s;t come in with him, and he followed in agony and exce&s;s of &s;orrow. He calmly de|&s;ired the buriers to let him alone, &s;aid he would only &s;ee the bodies thrown in, and go away; &s;o they left importuning him. But no &s;ooner was the cart turned round, and the bodies &s;hot into the pit promi&s;cou&s;ly, which was a &s;urpri&s;e to him, for he at lea&s;t expected, they would have been decently laid in, though indeed he was afterwards convinced that was impracti|cable, I &s;ay, no &s;ooner did he &s;ee the &s;ight, out he cryed out aloud, unable to contain him&s;elf, and fell down in a &s;woon; the buriers ran to him, and took him up, and when he was come to him&s;elf, led him to a place where he was taken care of. He looked into the pit again, as he went away, but the buriers had covered the bodies &s;o immediately with throwing earth, that nothing could be &s;een. The cart had in it &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen bodies. Some were wrapt up in linen &s;heets, &s;ome in rugs, &s;ome little other than naked, or &s;o loo&s;e, that what covering they had fell from them, in the &s;hooting out of the cart, and they &s;ell quite naked among the re&s;t; but the matter was not much to them, or the indecency much to any one el&s;e, &s;eeing they were to be huddled to|gether into the common grave of mankind;
<PB N="41" REF="011175_0041_0F862BC2ABB97758">for here was no difference made, but poor and rich went together; there was no other way of burials, neither was it po&s;&s;ible there &s;hould.</P>
<P><HI>John Hayward,</HI> under-&s;exton, that is, grave digger and bearer of the dead, never had the di&s;temper at all, but lived about twenty years after it. His wife was employed to nur&s;e the infected people; yet &s;he her&s;elf never was in|fected. The only pre&s;ervative he u&s;ed again&s;t the infection, was holding garlick and rue in his mouth, and &s;moaking tobacco; this I had from his own mouth. His wife's remedy was wa&s;hing her head in vinegar, and &s;prink|ling her head-clothes &s;o with vinegar, as to keep them always moi&s;t; and if the &s;mell of any of tho&s;e &s;he waited on was more than ordinary offen&s;ive, &s;he &s;nuffed vinegar up into her no&s;e, &s;prinkled her head-clothes and held a handker|chief wetted with vinegar to her mouth.</P>
<P>And here I mu&s;t not omit mentioning the di&s;po&s;ition of the people of that day, with re|&s;pect to their charity to the poor, which indeed was very large both in a publick and a private way. Some pious ladies were &s;o zealous in this good work, and &s;o con&s;ident in the protection of providence in the di&s;charge of this great duty, that they went about them&s;elves di&s;tri|buting alms, and vi&s;iting the poor families that were infected, in their very hou&s;es, appointing nur&s;es and apothecaries to &s;upply them with what they wanted; thus giving their ble&s;&s;ings to the poor in &s;ub&s;tantial relief, as well as hearty prayers for them. I will not undertake
<PB N="42" REF="011175_0042_0F862BC3703C28E8">to &s;ay, that none of the&s;e charitable people were &s;uffered to die of the plague, but this I may &s;ay, that I never knew any of them mi&s;carried, which I mention for the encouragement of others in ca&s;e of like di&s;tre&s;s; and doubtle&s;s, if they, <HI>that give to the poor, lend to the Lord, and he will repay it,</HI> tho&s;e that hazard their lives to give to the poor, and to comfort and a&s;&s;i&s;t them in &s;uch a mi&s;ery as this, may hope to be pro|tected therein.</P>
<P>From the middle of Augu&s;t to the middle of September the infection &s;till increa&s;ed and &s;pread it&s;elf, with an irre&s;i&s;tible fury; it was reckoned, that during that time there died no le&s;s than &s;ixteen hundred a day, one day with another. It was then that the confu&s;ion and terror was inexpre&s;&s;ible; the courage of the people appointed to carry away the dead, began to fail them; the vigilance of the magi|&s;trates was now put to the utmo&s;t trial. At la&s;t the violence of the di&s;temper came to &s;uch a height that the people &s;at &s;till looking at one another, and &s;eemed quite abandoned to de|&s;pair. In a word, people began to give them|&s;elves up to fear, that there was nothing to be expected but a univer&s;al de&s;olation. This de&s;|pair made people bold and adventurous, they were no more &s;hy of one another, as expecting there was now no avoiding the di&s;temper, but that all mu&s;t go, this brought them to crowd into the churches, they inquired no more what condition the people who &s;at near them, were
<PB N="43" REF="011175_0043_0F862BC42F33C550">in, but looking upon them&s;elves al&s;o as &s;o many dead corps, they came to the churches without the lea&s;t caution, and crowded together, as if their lives were of no con&s;equence, compared to the work which they were come about: In|deed, their zeal in coming, and the earne&s;tne&s;s and affectionate attention they &s;hewed to what they heard, made it manife&s;t what value peo|ple would put upon the wor&s;hip of God, if they thought, every day they attended at the church, would be their la&s;t. It was in the height of this de&s;pair, that it plea&s;ed God to &s;tay his hand, and to &s;lacken the fury of the contagion, in a manner as &s;urpri&s;ing as that of its beginning, and which demon&s;trated it to be his own particular hand above the agen|cy of means; nothing but omnipotent power could have done it; the contagion, de&s;pi&s;ed all medicine; death raged in every corner, and had it gone on as it did then, a few weeks more would have cleared the town of all its inhabi|tants. In that very moment when thirty thou|&s;and were dead in three weeks, nay, when it was reported three thou&s;and died in one night, and an hundred thou&s;and more were taken &s;ick, when we might well &s;ay, <HI>Vain was the help of man,</HI> it plea&s;ed God to cau&s;e the fury of it to abate, and by his immediate hand to di&s;arm the enemy. It was wonderful! The phy&s;icians were &s;urpri&s;ed, wherever they vi&s;ited, to find their patients better, and in a few days every body was recovering: Nor was this by any
<PB N="44" REF="011175_0044_0F862BC50FF68C40">medicine found out, or any new method of cure di&s;covered, but it was evidently from the &s;ecret invi&s;ible hand of him that had at fir&s;t &s;ent this di&s;ea&s;e, as a judgment upon us. Let the philo&s;ophers &s;earch for rea&s;ons in nature to account for it, and labour as much as they will to le&s;&s;en the debt they owe to their maker; tho&s;e phy&s;icians who had the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hare of re|ligion in them, were obliged to acknowledge, that it was all &s;upernatural. The &s;treets were now full of poor recovering creatures, who appeared very &s;en&s;ible and thankful to God for their unexpected deliverance: Yet I mu&s;t own, that as for the generality of the people, it might too ju&s;tly be &s;aid of them, as was &s;aid of the children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> after they had been de|livered from the ho&s;t of <HI>Pharoah,</HI> that <HI>they &s;ung his prai&s;e, but they &s;oon forgot his works.</HI></P>
<P>The author, who was pre&s;erved unhurt with his whole family, during the time of the &s;ick|ne&s;s, gives in his memoirs a particular account of the many rea&s;onings and fears which affect|ed his mind, before he could come to a fixed conclu&s;ion, whether to &s;tay, and take his lot in the &s;tation in which God had placed him, or by leaving the city, run the hazard of un|&s;ettling him&s;elf, and lo&s;e his effects which lay &s;cattered among the merchants. At the earne&s;t &s;olicitations of his brother he had concluded to go; but being always cro&s;&s;ed in this de&s;ign by &s;everal accidents, it came one morning, as he expre&s;&s;es it, very warmly in his mind, whether the&s;e repeated di&s;appointments were
<PB N="45" REF="011175_0045_0F862BC5D209FB20">not intimations to him, that it was the will of heaven he &s;hould not go, which was &s;ucceed|ed by a further thought, that if this &s;ugge&s;ti|on was from God, he was able effectually to pre&s;erve him in the mid&s;t of all deaths and dan|gers that would &s;urround him, and that if he attempted to &s;ecure him&s;elf, by fleeing from his habitation, and acted contrary to the&s;e in|timations, which he believed to be divine, it was a kind of flying from God, who could cau&s;e his ju&s;tice to overtake him, when and where he thought fit.</P>
<P>But what finally fixed him in a re&s;olution to &s;tay, and ca&s;t him&s;elf entirely upon the pro|tection and good plea&s;ure of the Almighty, was, that at a time, when his thoughts were more than commonly &s;eriousupon this weighty &s;ubject, turning over the bible which lay be|fore him, he cryed out, <HI>Well, I know not what to do, Lord direct me!</HI> at that juncture happen|ing to &s;top and ca&s;ting his eye on the &s;econd ver&s;e of the 91&s;t P&s;alm, he read to the 10th, as follows, viz. <HI>I will &s;ay of the Lord, he is my refuge and my fortre&s;s, my God, in him will I tru&s;t. Surely he &s;hall deliver thee from the &s;nare of the fowler, and from the noi&s;om pe&s;tilence. He &s;hall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings &s;halt thou tru&s;t: His truth &s;hall be thy &s;hield and buckler. Thou &s;halt not be afraid for the terror by night, nor for the arrow that flieth by day, nor for the pe&s;tilence that walketh in darkne&s;s, nor for the de&s;truction that wa&s;teth at noon-day. A thou|&s;and &s;hall fall at thy &s;ide, and ten thou&s;and at thy
<PB N="46" REF="011175_0046_0F862BC66D87DE58">right hand; but it &s;hall not come nigh thee. Only with thine eyes &s;halt thou behold and &s;ee the reward of the wicked. Becau&s;e thou ha&s;t made the Lord which is thy refuge, even the mo&s;t high thy habi|tation: There &s;hall no evil befall thee, neither &s;hall any plague come nigh thy dwelling, &amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>AN eminent &s;ervant of God, who had known deliverance from the dark pow|ers, and experimentally felt the powers of the world to come, a few hours before his death, expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the following words: <Q>There is a &s;pirit which I feel, that delights to do no evil, nor to revenge any wrong, but delights to endure all things, in hopes to enjoy its own in the end; its hope is to out|live all wrath and contention, and to weary out all exaltation and cruelty, or what&s;oever is of a nature contrary to it&s;elf; it &s;ees to the end of all temptations; as it bears no evil in it&s;elf, &s;o it conceives none in thought to any other; for its ground and &s;pring is the mer|cies and forgivene&s;s of God; its crown is meekne&s;s; its life is everla&s;ting love unfeign|ed, and takes its kingdom with intreaty, and not with contention, and keeps it by lowline&s;s of mind; in God alone it can re|joice, though none el&s;e regard it, or can own its life; 'tis conceived in &s;orrow, and brought forth without any to pity it, nor doth it murmur at grief and oppre&s;&s;ions; it never rejoiceth but through &s;ufferings, for with the world's joy it is murdered. I found

<P>A Strong te&s;timony to the &s;uperior excel|lency of go&s;pel-love, and to the vanity and emptine&s;s of worldly enjoyments, is given by Sir John Ma&s;on, who tho' but 63 years old at his death, yet had lived and flouri&s;hed in the reign of 4 princes, viz. Henry 8th, Edward the 6th, Queen Mary and Elizabeth; and was pri|vy-coun&s;ellor to them all, and an eye-witne&s;s of the various revolutions and vici&s;&s;itudes of tho&s;e times. Towards his latter end, being on his death-bed, he called his clark and &s;teward, and &s;poke thus to them,&mdash;Lo! here have I lived to &s;ee five princes, and have been privy-coun&s;ellor to four of them. I have &s;een the mo&s;t remark|ables in foreign parts, and have been pre&s;ent at mo&s;t tran&s;actions for 30 years together, and I have learned this after &s;o many years experi|ence, that &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s is the greate&s;t wi&s;dom, temperance the be&s;t phy&s;ic, and a good con|&s;cience the be&s;t e&s;tate; and were I to live again, I would change the court for a cloi&s;ter, my privy-coun&s;ellor's bu&s;tle, for an hermit's re|tirement, and the whole life I have lived in the palace for an hour's enjoyment of God in the chapel. All things el&s;e for&s;ake me, be&s;ide my God, my duty, and my prayers."</P>
<P>SECRETARY Wal&s;ingham, is al&s;o a remarkable in&s;tance of the &s;ame kind. He was a man
<PB N="48" REF="011175_0048_0F862BC7E9403228">of very great note, in Queen Elizabeth's days. In a letter to his fellow-&s;ecretary, Burleigh, then lord trea&s;urer of England, he writes thus, <Q>We have lived enough to our country, our fortunes, our &s;overeign: It is high time we begin to live to our&s;elves, and to our God:</Q> Which giving occa&s;ion for &s;ome court-droll to vi&s;it and try to divert him. <Q>Ah, &s;aid he, while we laugh, all things are &s;erious round about us, God is &s;erious, when he pre&s;erveth us, and hath patience towards us; Chri&s;t is &s;erious when he dieth for us; the Holy Gho&s;t is &s;erious when he &s;triveth with us; the whole cre|ation is &s;erious in &s;erving God and us: they are &s;erious in hell and in heaven. And &s;hall a man that hath one foot in the grave, je&s;t and laugh?</Q></P>
<P>SELDEN, one of the greate&s;t &s;cholars and antiquaries of his time; who had taken a diligent &s;urvey of what knowledge was con&s;iderable among&s;t the Jews, Hea|thens and Chri&s;tians; at la&s;t profe&s;&s;eth this towards the end of his days, that not wit&s;tanding he had been &s;o labo|rious in his inquiries, and curious in his coliections, and had po&s;&s;e&s;t him&s;elf of a trea&s;ure of books and manu&s;cripts upon all ancient &s;ubjects. yet he could re&s;t his &s;oul on none &s;ave the &s;cripture. And above all, that pa&s;&s;age lay mo&s;t remarkably upon his &s;pirit, Titus, ii. 11. &amp;c. <HI>For the grace of God that bringeth &s;alvation, hath appeared unto all men; teaching us, that denying ungodline&s;s and wordly lu&s;ts, we &s;hould live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly, and godly in this pre&s;ent world, looking for that ble&s;&s;ed hope and glorious appearing of the great God and our &s;aviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t; who gave him&s;elf for us, that be might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto him&s;elf a peculiar people, zealous of good works: The&s;e things &s;peak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority.</HI></P>
