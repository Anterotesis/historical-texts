<HEAD>THE <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> OF THE Scribes <HI>and</HI> Phari&s;ees CONSIDER'D.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>MATTH. V. xx.</HI></BIBL>
<P>For I &s;ay unto you, That except your Righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall exceed the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, ye &s;hall in no Ca&s;e enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THESE Words are as weighty and &s;o|lemn, and as much de&s;erve and re|quire our &s;erious and &s;peedy Con&s;ide|ration and clo&s;e Application, as any I know of in the whole Book of God.</P>
<P>It is a mo&s;t difficult Task to bring back &s;ecure Sinners to the &s;erious Search of their State towards God, and their Springs of Action; they conclude without an impartial Tryal, without Rea&s;on, that they are in a &s;afe Condition, and &s;o go on building a Fabrick in the Air.
<PB N="2" REF="004821_0004_100DF81340357B68">They endeavour to grow in Grace, before they get Grace. But can the fond and groundle&s;s Notions of Men's Brains alter the Nature of God and of Things? Will a Building &s;tand well without a Foundation, or up|on a &s;andy one? Would it not be better for Mankind, to labour with Impartiality and Speed to know the wor&s;t of their State, while there is an Opportunity to get it alter'd?</P>
<P>Is it rea&s;onable for Men, in order to prevent a little nece&s;&s;ary and tran&s;ient Trouble of Mind, to ru&s;h upon the Bo&s;&s;es of God's Buckler? To ru&s;h again&s;t the &s;trong|e&s;t Remon&s;trances of Con&s;cience and of God, into inex|pre&s;&s;ible, incomprehen&s;ible, intolerable, and eternal Tor|ments? Is not this ju&s;t as if a Man, in order to e&s;cape the Bite of a Musketoe, would run his naked Bo&s;om again&s;t a drawn Sword?</P>
<P>I am grieved to behold the prepo&s;terous Practice of many of this Generation, who like fooli&s;h Children are attempting to rai&s;e a Super&s;tructure, before they lay the Foundation.</P>
<P>I would to God, that that golden Saying of our Lord, <HI>A corrupt Tree cannot bring forth good Fruit,</HI> was better under&s;tood, and more &s;eriou&s;ly ponder'd upon, by the Profe&s;&s;ors of this Age</P>
<P>If <HI>all that are born of the Fle&s;h, be Fle&s;h,</HI> and if <HI>he that is in the Fle&s;h,</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> unconverted) <HI>cannot plea&s;e God,</HI> or per|form acceptable Service, any more than a Thorn can bring forth Figs, or a Thi&s;tle Grapes; then it is of the la&s;t Moment for us, to begin at the right End of Religi|on, by enquiring into our Hearts and Principles of Action, and not re&s;ting 'till we come to a &s;criptural <HI>Conclu&s;ion</HI> a|bout our pre&s;ent State. If it be good, we need the Com|fort of it, in a World of Labour and Sorrow; if bad, we need to know it, that &s;o we may be affected with the Mi|&s;eries of it, and &s;o with Earne&s;tne&s;s u&s;e proper Means to ob|tain an E&s;cape. If Men know not the Mi&s;eries of their na|tural State, how &s;hall they be duly affected with what they know not? And if they be not deeply affected, how can it be rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed that they will u&s;e Violence to take the Kingdom of God? And without a holy Vio|lence
<PB N="3" REF="004821_0004_100DF81340357B68">or Importunity, what Rea&s;on is there to expect an Intere&s;t in it?</P>
<P>Con&s;cience and Credit excite many Men to take &s;ome Care of their outward Actions, and having done this, they re&s;t &s;ecurely with the old Phari&s;ees: Many now-a-days clean&s;e the <HI>out&s;ide</HI> of the Cup and Platter, but leave the in&s;ide foul and neglected.</P>
<P>This being the Ca&s;e of Multitudes at this Time, Is it not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ound the Alarm of God's Judgments; to cry aloud and not &s;pare, to &s;hew to <HI>Judah</HI> their Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions, and the Hou&s;e of <HI>Jacob</HI> their Sins? To try by the Terrors of the Lord to per&s;wade Men? For this we have the Example of our Saviour in the Text under our pre&s;ent Con&s;ideration; which, doubtle&s;s, however it may &s;eem to the Sons of this Generation, was a terrible Paradox in the Age in which it was &s;poken! For then the Scribes and Phari&s;ees had the greate&s;t Fame for Re|ligion, and took more Pains about it than any others; &s;o that the People of that Age had a common Proverb, That if but two were &s;aved, one would be a Scribe, and the other a Phari&s;ee.</P>
<P>Seeing that Life and Immortality are bro't to Light by the Go&s;pel, it is well worth our Labour, to enquire, Upon what Terms an Intere&s;t therein may be obtained: To this our Lord gives a plain and pungent An&s;wer, in the Words of the Text, which inform us, That except our Righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall exceed the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, we &s;hall in no Ca&s;e enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</P>
<P>By the <HI>Kingdom of Heaven</HI> here, we are not to under|&s;tand the vi&s;ible Church, as el&s;ewhere the Term is taken, but the Seat of the Ble&s;&s;ed; for we have too great Rea|&s;on to believe, That many who have not a Righteou&s;ne&s;s exceeding that of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, are too ea&s;ily admitted as Members of the vi&s;ible Church.</P>
<P>The lax Method of Admi&s;&s;ion to &s;acred Communion, which has too generally obtained among the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Churches, more e&s;pecially of late, has been, I believe, one great Cau&s;e of the lamentable Decay of Religion in them! This, the fir&s;t Fathers of this Country, who had
<PB N="4" REF="004821_0005_100DF81611318128" MS="y">much of the Simplicity and Power of the Religion of Chri&s;t, were very &s;en&s;ible of, as appeared by their Practice re|&s;pecting Church Fellow&s;hip.</P>
<P>But however Hypocrites may, by their &s;pecious Pre|tences deceive and intrude, or by the Carele&s;sne&s;s of Watchmen obtain a Place in the <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> Church, yet they &s;hall in no Ca&s;e enter into the <HI>invi&s;ible,</HI> viz. the <HI>Kingdom of Heaven;</HI> all their Pleas and Pretences will be baffled and rejected, their Mouths &s;hut, and their fal&s;e Hopes turned into everla&s;ting Di&s;pair and Horror!</P>
<P>The Paradi&s;e of God is compared to a Kingdom, to &s;ignify the Order and Harmony that there &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, as well as the impregnable Strength of the Place, and the univer&s;al perpetual Subjection of all its Inhabitants, to the Empire of the great GOD, the King of Kings.</P>
<P>Now in order to explain the &s;olemn Propo&s;ition of our Saviour in the Words before us, I intend to pur&s;ue the following Method,</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place &s;hew, <HI>what the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees was.</HI> And</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Wherein we mu&s;t exceed them</HI> upon Pain of Death. And</P>
<P>Thirdly, Offer &s;ome Things to <HI>confirm and illu&s;trate</HI> the Propo&s;ition. We return to the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>The Scribes were Writers of the Law, and the Pha|ri&s;ees a &s;trict religious Sect of the <HI>Jews,</HI> who tru&s;ted they were righteous and de&s;pi&s;ed others, of the&s;e many were publick Teachers of others. But before I &s;peak of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, I would premi&s;e this, <HI>viz.</HI> That I intend to di&s;cour&s;e upon the Attainments of the &s;tricte&s;t of them, and that with this View, that what &s;hall be &s;aid may have the greater Ten|dency to convince the Secure.</P>
<P>Some of the Phari&s;ees were gro&s;s Hypocrites, who took up a Cloak of Religion, in order to &s;ecure worldly Gain; for a <HI>Pretence they made long Prayers,</HI> that they might <HI>devour Widows Hou&s;es.</HI> Some were much for O&s;tentation in Alms-giving, and other Duties. But we are not to imagine that this was the Character and Tem|per
<PB N="5" REF="004821_0005_100DF81611318128" MS="y">of the whole Sect. No, not at all; the <HI>young Man</HI> of the Go&s;pel, <HI>Paul</HI> before his Conver&s;ion, and the fool|i&s;h Virgins were of another Stamp and Di&s;po&s;ition; they had a moral Integrity and Seriou&s;ne&s;s. Now <HI>Brethren,</HI> Until we exceed the highe&s;t Reach of the be&s;t Sort of the Phari&s;ees and all other Hypocrites that have been upon the Stage of Time, I can't &s;ee that we have the lea&s;t Ground for Peace and Quiet.</P>
<P>The Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees may be &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t in the&s;e two Generals, <HI>viz.</HI> 1&s;t. In a certain <HI>Blamele&s;sne&s;s</HI> or <HI>Freedom from gro&s;s Crimes.</HI> And 2dly, In a &s;trict <HI>Conformity to the moral and ceremonial Laws.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Law, <HI>Paul,</HI> while a Phari&s;ee, was <HI>blamele&s;s,</HI> Phil. 3 Chap. But it may not be improper here to en|quire more particularly, How &s;trictly and punctually the Phari&s;ees performed the Duties required by the fir&s;t and &s;econd Table of the moral Law, as to the Letter of them.</P>
<P>They not only believed that there was a God, but were very zealous in celebrating the Duties of his Wor|&s;hip; they were certainly one of the mo&s;t &s;ound and or|dox Sects of the jewi&s;h Nation, much preferable to the Sadducees, (who in many Things re&s;emble our modern infidel Dei&s;ts,) they were diligent in attending publick Prayers at the &s;tated Sea&s;ons: Hence we find that the Phari&s;ee is &s;aid, by our Lord, to go with the Publican to the Temple to pray; as, no doubt, many of both &s;orts do this Night. They were al&s;o &s;trict in ob&s;erving the Duties of Family-Religion; which &s;ome think is intended by that Pa&s;&s;age of our Lord re&s;pecting them, <HI>viz.</HI> That they pray'd &s;tanding in the Corners of the Streets, <HI>i. e.</HI> &s;ay they, in Corners of Hou&s;es; they were not a&s;ham'd to perform the Duties of Religion in the mo&s;t publick and con&s;picuous Places, altho' they mu&s;t needs know, that this would expo&s;e them, in all probability, to the Taunts and Fleers of the Sadducees, who could not brook even &s;o much as the dead Form of Religion! This is a greater Length than many Pretenders to Chri&s;tianity come now-a-days, who, when they come to irreligious
<PB N="6" REF="004821_0006_100DF8179B43B4B0">Places, &s;oon lay a&s;ide their Form, and turn with the Tide.</P>
<P>The old Phari&s;ees pray'd &s;ecretly many &s;cores of Times in a Day, they had Prayers &s;uited to every Oc|currence, which they punctually us'd. It is &s;toried of them, that &s;ome of that Sect, in order to excite them|&s;elves to &s;ecret Devotion in the night Sea&s;on, were u&s;ed to put a bra&s;s Bowl by their Bed-&s;ide, and hold a Bullet in their Hand, that &s;o by the Bullet's falling into the Bowl, they might be alarmed to Prayer.</P>
<P>The Phari&s;ees had al&s;o a great Veneration for God's Name: they they wou'dn't mention the Name of JE|HOVAH in their common Di&s;cour&s;e. And &s;o &s;trict were they in the Ob&s;ervation of the Sabbath, that they &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly charg'd our Lord with a Breach of it, for doing Works of Nece&s;&s;ity and Mercy, in healing the Sick, and relieving the Nece&s;&s;ities of Nature.</P>
<P>The Fame which the Phari&s;ees obtain'd and retain'd as to Religion, nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es, That a Number of them were &s;trictly hone&s;t in their Dealings with Men; for what&s;oever Regard Men may pretend to the Duties of the fir&s;t Table of the Law, yet if they ob&s;erve not the Laws of Hone&s;ty, in civil Life, they'l &s;oon crack their Credit.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Cha&s;tity;</HI> the Phari&s;ees were &s;o &s;trict, that it is reported of them, that they wore deep brim'd Hatts, lea&s;t thro' the Windows of the Sen&s;es, their Minds &s;hould be &s;tain'd by tempting Objects, and thus indulge uncha&s;t Meditations.</P>
<P>It is certain, that the old Phari&s;ees, had a <HI>Zeal for the Good of the Souls</HI> of their Fellow-Creatures, and this they expre&s;s'd by much Pain and Labour: They compa&s;&s;ed Sea and Land, to make Pro&s;elites to their Sect. Their Zeal was ting'd with that of a party Spirit; and thus it is with their Succe&s;&s;ors at this Day. There are many rigid <HI>Bigotts</HI> of all Sects, who are more zealous about <HI>tything Mint, and Annis, and Cummin,</HI> than about the <HI>weightier Matters of the Law!</HI> more &s;tudious to pro&s;e|lite People to their <HI>&s;everal Parties,</HI> than to CHRIST. All that are ju&s;tify'd by CHRIST's Blood, and &s;anctify'd by
<PB N="7" REF="004821_0006_100DF8179B43B4B0">his Spirit, upon Earth, will doubtle&s;s agree in Heaven; and therefore they &s;hould not ju&s;tle in the Way to it.</P>
<P>We are inform'd, Luk. 18.11, 12. That <HI>the Phari|&s;ee &s;tood and prayed thus with him&s;elf, GOD I thank thee, that I am not as other Men are, Extortioners, Unju&s;t&punc; Adulterers, or even as this Publican: I fa&s;t twice in the Week, I give Tithes of all I po&s;&s;e&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>But to explain and illu&s;trate this Head of Di&s;cour&s;e, let me offer a few In&s;tances more.</P>
<P>That of the <HI>young Man in the Go&s;pel,</HI> is very memora|ble: He was <HI>concerned about</HI> the Salvation of his Soul; be gave our Lord a civil Salutation, <HI>Good Ma&s;ter,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>What &s;hall I do to inherit eternal Life?</HI> And in his An&s;wer to our Saviour, he a&s;&s;erted, That <HI>he had kept all the Laws from his Youth up,</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> outwardly) which our Lord did not contradict. Which of you now in this <HI>great A&s;&s;embly,</HI> exceeds that <HI>young Phari&s;ee?</HI></P>
<P>The next In&s;tance I would mention, is that of <HI>Paul</HI> be|fore his Conver&s;ion, of which we have an Account, <HI>Phil.</HI> 3d Chap. He &s;ays of him&s;elf, That <HI>if any Man thinketh, that he hath whereof he might tru&s;t in the Fle&s;h,</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> in his <HI>own</HI> Righteou&s;ne&s;s) <HI>he more.</HI> He further adds, That <HI>he was of the Stock of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>of the Tribe of</HI> Benja|min, <HI>an Hebrew of the Hebrews; touching the Law, a</HI> Phari&s;ee; <HI>concerning Zeal, per&s;ecuting the Church; as touching the Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is in the Law, blamele&s;s.</HI> Well, <HI>my Fathers and Brethren,</HI> See what a dreadful Pitch in Religion this <HI>Phari&s;ee</HI> came to, and yet was not &s;o much as convinced! Which of you now exceeds the Attainments of this Man, while under the Cur&s;e of CHRIST? Don't &s;ay within your &s;elves, that you have <HI>Abraham</HI> to your Father. What will your good Paren|tage avail you, unle&s;s you walk in the Steps of their Sim|plicity, Faith, and Holine&s;s, but to aggravate your ever|la&s;ting Pains? becau&s;e of your rebellious and ungrateful oppo&s;ing of the Light of their In&s;tructions and Exam|ples! May I not &s;ay unto you, as my Ma&s;ter once did to the <HI>Jews, Ye are of your Father the Devil; for his Works you will do.</HI> A <HI>Pagan</HI> could &s;ay, <HI>Quae avi et proavi,</HI> &amp;c. What our Parents and Grand-Parents have done, are
<PB N="8" REF="004821_0007_100DF819241021C8">not our's Think not that your being admitted to out|ward Ordinances, will &s;creen you from GOD's Ven|geance; this was the fooli&s;h Confidence of the carnal <HI>Jews,</HI> who &s;aid, <HI>The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, are the&s;e. Saul,</HI> a Phari&s;ee, was circumcis'd, and no doubt he partook of the Pa&s;&s;over: Do you depend upon the &s;oundne&s;s of your Sect, and inoffen&s;ivene&s;s of your Life; why <HI>Saul</HI> was of the <HI>&s;tricte&s;t Sect</HI> of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and as to the Law, blamele&s;s.</P>
<P>The la&s;t In&s;tance I &s;hall mention, under this Head, is, that of the <HI>fooli&s;h Virgins,</HI> recorded <HI>Matth.</HI> 25th Chap. Were they not call'd <HI>Virgins,</HI> becau&s;e of their <HI>cha&s;te</HI> and <HI>regular</HI> Conver&s;ation; did they not carry Lamps, which &s;hews their Profe&s;&s;ion of the <HI>true</HI> Religion; did they not keep Company with the Wi&s;e, which &s;uppo&s;es that they had &s;ome Love to tho&s;e that were <HI>truly</HI> good? And are not their Lamps &s;aid to go out? which &s;peaks forth the Moving they once had in their Affections towards God and Goodne&s;s, like the &s;tony-ground Hearers, who are &s;aid to <HI>receive the Seed of the Word with Joy,</HI> but wanting Root, in Time of Temptation fall away. Had they not a &s;trong Confidence that they &s;hould be kindly accepted of at la&s;t by the Bridegroom? Had not the wi&s;e Virgins a good Opinion of them, and did they not take Pains them&s;elves to prepare for the Bridegroom's Coming? And yet, behold and tremble, ye <HI>Phari&s;ees!</HI> when the Bridegroom did come, the marriage chamber Door was &s;tove in their Faces: O confounding dreadful Di&s;appoint|ment! Take Care, Friends, le&s;t after all your &s;oundne&s;s in Principle, &s;trictne&s;s of Life, Love to God's People, religious Affections, Pains and Confidence, the Door of Mercy, of Hope, and Salvation ben't &s;hut again&s;t you, by and by, for ever!</P>
<P>But I proceed to con&s;ider the</P>
<P><HI>Second</HI> general Head of Di&s;cour&s;e, which was, To &s;hew wherein we mu&s;t <HI>exceed</HI> the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> upon Pain of Death. I an&s;wer, in two In&s;tances, We mu&s;t receive that Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Saviour by <HI>Imputation</HI> which they <HI>rejected;</HI> and have an inward Righteou&s;ne&s;s by <HI>Implantation,</HI> which they <HI>wanted.</HI> And,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="9" REF="004821_0007_100DF819241021C8">
1. I &s;ay, We mu&s;t have an <HI>outward</HI> Righteou&s;ne&s;s by <HI>Imputation,</HI> which the Phari&s;ees <HI>rejected.</HI></P>
<P>The Phari&s;ees, as to the outward Part of Duty, did well; but herein they unhappily fail'd, they depended upon their Doings for Acceptance with God; they tru&s;t|ed in their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s and de&s;pi&s;ed others: Yea, they &s;lighted Chri&s;t him&s;elf, for as <HI>Je&s;us</HI> ob&s;erved, <HI>The Whole need no Phy&s;ician, but the Sick;</HI> they heal'd their &s;lighty Wounds by their dead Performances, and thus remain'd in&s;en&s;ible of their ab&s;olute Need of an <HI>almighty</HI> Phy&s;ician! <HI>Being ignorant of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of GOD,</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> of <HI>the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the</HI> Me&s;&s;ias, which was of God the Father's &s;ending out and Acceptance) <HI>and go|ing about to e&s;tabli&s;h their own, they did not &s;ubmit them|&s;elves to the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of GOD.</HI> They &s;ought after Righteou&s;ne&s;s (or Ju&s;tification) and did not find it, be|cau&s;e they &s;ought it <HI>not of Faith,</HI> (i. e. <HI>wholly</HI> by the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t,</HI> which Faith can only apprehend) but, as it. were, by the <HI>Works of the Law.</HI> Ob&s;erve, They didn't &s;eek it <HI>wholly</HI> by the Works of the Law, but in <HI>part:</HI> They tho't that their Obedience would do <HI>&s;omething</HI> towards their Acceptance with God; that the Almighty would be induc'd hereby to pitty and pardon them, and that it would be hard Treatment, if the Al|mighty &s;hould reject them, after all their good Meanings, Harmle&s;sne&s;s, and religious Labours.</P>
<P>But, to bring the Matter a little clo&s;er, for the Di&s;co|very of Hypocrites, let it be ob&s;erv'd, That tho&s;e who receive the <HI>outward</HI> Righteou&s;ne&s;s of CHRIST as Medi|ator, are <HI>fir&s;t</HI> convinc'd by the Law and Spirit, of their <HI>Want</HI> of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, according to the Promi&s;e of our Saviour in his humbled State, <HI>Job.</HI> 16.8, 9. and the&s;e Convictions are full, clear, con&s;tant; the Sinner is &s;o convinc'd of Sin, in Life, Heart, State, and has &s;uch a View of the Certainty, Dreadfulne&s;s, and Eternity of that Damnation he is hereby expo&s;ed to, that he is deeply di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in Heart, <HI>(a wounded Spirit who can bear?)</HI> and cannot re&s;t 'till he finds JESUS: And that which encrea&s;es his Unea&s;ine&s;s, is the Sight and &s;orrowful Sen&s;e he has of his Ignorance and Inability to help him&s;elf out
<PB N="10" REF="004821_0008_100DEE8A76AF5420">of his pre&s;ent State of Sin and Mi&s;ery; and the De&s;pair he has in the Help of all meer Creatures. The&s;e Things are &s;et in a &s;trong Light, by that beautiful Pa&s;|&s;age, in the Epi&s;tle of <HI>Paul</HI> to the Romans, 7th Chap. and 3d Ver&s;e, where he &s;ays, That <HI>he was alive without the Law once: i. e.</HI> before the Law was opened in its &s;piri|tual Breadth, by the Holy Gho&s;t to his Mind, and &s;et home with irre&s;i&s;table Energy upon his Heart; he was alive to <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> as his <HI>la&s;t End,</HI> to the Law as a Cove|nant of Works; he expected to <HI>gain</HI> Life by the Law; he was al&s;o imaginarily alive, and was very perk and merry, as all natural Men are, before they are wounded by the Law. Its a &s;ad Sight to behold how merrily they go on to Damnation; like Fools in <HI>Bedlam,</HI> they &s;ing and dance in their Shackels: But when the Law comes, <HI>Sin revives</HI> in their View, born as to its Numbers, Aggra|vations, and Condemnation, like a Lyon rampant, ready every Moment to devour them! <HI>Then,</HI> and not 'till then, the Sinner <HI>dies to him&s;elf,</HI> dies to the Law, dies to his former fal&s;e Peace and Hope, and dies to all worldly Hopes, Fears and Enjoyments! The Law &s;lays him, and he thro' the Law, as an In&s;trument, open'd and ap|plied, dies to the Law, as a Covenant of Works. In this Ca&s;e the poor Creature cannot re&s;t, 'till CHRIST be revealed and applied to his Soul, by the Word and Spirit of GOD.</P>
<P>Now, When the &s;ick Sinner has got a Di&s;covery of CHRIST's Fullne&s;s, Suitablene&s;s, and Willingne&s;s to help the Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; being &s;en&s;ible of his ab&s;olute Need of JESUS, in all his Offices and Relations, he receives him in every of them; and is willing, not only to be govern'd by his Law, but to bear his Cro&s;s, in its utmo&s;t Extent.</P>
<P>And here let it be ob&s;erved, That Faith, which re|ceives the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of CHRIST, has effectual Influ|ence upon the Heart and Practice; it <HI>purifies the Heart, works by Love,</HI> and <HI>overcomes the World.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e Per&s;ons who receive the imputed Righteou&s;ne&s;s of CHRIST, know what it is to be <HI>poor in Spirit;</HI> what it is to have Peace of Con&s;cience, after Di&s;tre&s;s, upon the Application of Chri&s;t to their Souls; as al&s;o what it is to
<PB N="11" REF="004821_0008_100DEE8A76AF5420">have the Love of God &s;pread abroad in their Hearts ex|perimentally; they have a <HI>Tenderne&s;s</HI> for God's Honour, Kingdom, and People. The</P>
<P N="2">2d Particular, In which we mu&s;t exceed the Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> upon pain of Death, is this, We mu&s;t have an <HI>inward</HI> Righteou&s;ne&s;s by <HI>Im|plantation,</HI> or <HI>Infu&s;ion,</HI> thro' the Spirit, which they wanted.</P>
<P>The <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> fail'd in the main Spring of Action: They wanted the <HI>New-Birth:</HI> They were utterly de&s;ti|tute of holy <HI>Principles,</HI> without which, <HI>Actions</HI> cannot be good; they &s;erv'd God in the <HI>oldne&s;s of the Letter,</HI> but not in the <HI>newne&s;s of the Spirit.</HI> Altho' the <HI>Matter</HI> of their Actions was good, yet becau&s;e they perform'd them by their <HI>own</HI> Strength, and for their <HI>own</HI> Ends, chiefly; that GOD, who is a Spirit, and to whom &s;piritual Service is only acceptable, rejected them.</P>
<P>When there is a Fault in the <HI>main Spring</HI> of a Clock, the Motion mu&s;t be &s;topt for a Time, and the main Spring &s;et right, before it will an&s;wer its De&s;ign in mea&s;uring of the Hours: And thus mu&s;t it be with gracele&s;s Sinners; they mu&s;t, by Examination and Conviction, be bro't to a &s;olemn Pau&s;e, and then get a new Principle of Action in|fus'd by the New-Birth, which will naturally and nece&s;&s;a|rily turn the free and general Bya&s;s of their whole Souls towards GOD, and &s;o prepare them for, and di&s;po&s;e them to acceptable Service.</P>
<P>Now tho&s;e that are born of the Spirit, receive the Kingdom of God as <HI>little Children,</HI> and generally &s;avour mo&s;t the Things of the Spirit; as little Children hunger after the Milk of the Brea&s;t, thus do they de&s;ire after the <HI>&s;incere Milk of the Word, i. e.</HI> the Truths of CHRIST, &s;poken &s;imply and &s;avourily from the Heart, without the vain Affection of humane Wit and Eloquence. Little Children mourn at the Ab&s;ence of their Parents, and grow in Stature; thus tho&s;e who are born of the Spirit, bitter|ly bewail Chri&s;t's Ab&s;ence, and in&s;atiably thir&s;t and ho|ne&s;tly labour for Growth in Knowledge, Holine&s;s, and U&s;efulne&s;s; but Phari&s;ees are contented with their dead dry Round of Duties, tho' they make no more Progre&s;s
<PB N="12" REF="004821_0009_100DF81D0CC7B2B0">than a Door on the Hinges, or a turn&s;pit Dog in a Wheel.</P>
<P>From tho&s;e that are born of the Spirit, <HI>old Things pa&s;s away, and all Things become new:</HI> Their old fal&s;e Peace, fal&s;e Hope, Hatred again&s;t God's Ways and People, Pride of Heart, Covetou&s;ne&s;s, and worldly Conver&s;ation pa&s;s away; and now they &s;ee divine Things in a new and affecting Manner, and have a new Pliablene&s;s of Will, readily to comply with the Terms of the Go&s;pel, a new Run of their Affections to GOD as their Center, a new Tenderne&s;s of Con&s;cience, a new Love to Ene|mies, a new and heavenly Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>I proceed to confider the</P>
<P N="3">3d General Head of Di&s;cour&s;e, which was to offer &s;ome Con&s;iderations tending to <HI>confirm</HI> and <HI>illu&s;trate</HI> the Propo&s;ition of our Lord, in the Text we treat upon.</P>
<P>And here I may ob&s;erve, That an outward, or <HI>phari|&s;aical</HI> Righteou&s;ne&s;s, does not an&s;wer the Demands of the Law, which proceeding from a pure and perfect Spi|rit, requires not only an outward but an inward and compleat Conformity to it: A phari&s;aical Righteou&s;ne&s;s is defective, and the Law cur&s;es for the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> Defect, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.10.</P>
<P>Neither does a phari&s;aical Righteou&s;ne&s;s an&s;wer the <HI>Demands</HI> of the Go&s;pel, becau&s;e it wants tho&s;e main Prin|ciples of acceptable Service, which the Go&s;pel requires, Namely, <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Love;</HI> without which, <HI>whatever we do</HI> is Sin.</P>
<P>A phari&s;aical Righteou&s;ne&s;s can neither prepare us for nor entitle us to eternal Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s; becau&s;e it may con|&s;i&s;t with a coverning Enmity again&s;t God, his Ways and People. This is evident from the Example of the <HI>old Phari&s;ees,</HI> who notwith&s;tanding their <HI>Strictne&s;s,</HI> were <HI>vi|rulent Oppo&s;ers</HI> of Chri&s;t and his Followers. And here, <HI>My Brethren,</HI> Let me ob&s;erve, That if this Work of GOD which is more remarkably begun in <HI>New-England</HI> of late, be carry'd on, you will &s;ee &s;ome that profe&s;s the greate&s;t Regard to Religion now, &s;tand up and oppo&s;e it with implacable Hate. <HI>Formali&s;ts</HI> cannot brook the <HI>Power</HI> of Religion, our Lord and his Apo&s;tles were not oppo&s;ed
<PB N="13" REF="004821_0009_100DF81D0CC7B2B0">by any, &s;o much as by that Sett of Men. Altho' <HI>Phari|&s;ees</HI> make a <HI>fair Shew</HI> in the Fle&s;h, yet are the main Springs of their Obedience, mean and ignoble.</P>
<P>Some are bro't to this outward Strictne&s;s, meerly by the Force of a <HI>religious Education;</HI> long Cu&s;tom makes the Performance of Duties ea&s;y, as it were a &s;econd Na|ture, &s;o that it creates Unea&s;ine&s;s to neglect them.</P>
<P>Some are regular in Life, thro' <HI>Want of much Tempta|tion</HI> to the contrary. The Devil does not tempt the <HI>Se|cure</HI> much, lea&s;t he &s;hould &s;care them out of his Clutches. While the <HI>&s;trong Man arm'd keeps the Hou&s;e, all the Goods are in Peace.</HI> What tho' a <HI>Rattle-Snake</HI> does not &s;pit its Venom in the Winter, for want of the warming Beams of the Sun, yet it has the <HI>poi&s;onous Nature</HI> of a <HI>Snake</HI> &s;till.</P>
<P>Some obtain <HI>Credit</HI> among their fellow Creatures, or to <HI>pre&s;erve</HI> it when obtain'd, labour for the <HI>outward Form:</HI> This is their main Motive, and a wretched one it is.</P>
<P>Some are careful in the outward Duties of Religion, thiefly in order to <HI>acquire</HI> or <HI>pre&s;erve Peace of Mind.</HI></P>
<P>Some perform this outward Obedience, as <HI>Slaves,</HI> prin|cipally to e&s;cape the Whip of eternal Damnation: If you hold a Whip over a Dog's Head, it will &s;care him from &s;natching at a Bone, which notwith&s;tanding he has a great Love to.</P>
<P>Others perform this phari&s;aical Obedience as <HI>Hirelings,</HI> chiefly out of Re&s;pect to the Wages; they imagine that their rotten Truck of gracele&s;s Prayers, and other dead Duties, will do &s;omething towards the purcha&s;ing of God's Favour for them. They think that if they do what they can, the Almighty will be in their Debt, their Salvation will be certain. They imagine that the Lord will be induc'd by their Doings, to &s;hew them Kind|ne&s;s rather than Others. But it <HI>is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of GOD that &s;heweth Mercy.</HI></P>
<P>Thus you may &s;ee, <HI>Brethren,</HI> That all this <HI>outward</HI> O|bedience, ina&s;much as it &s;prings not from <HI>Love to GOD,</HI> for him&s;elf, as its main Principle, but from <HI>&s;elfi&s;h Re&s;pects,</HI> is mean and &s;ordid, and tho' it has a fair Sun, yet is it, up|on the afore&s;aid Account, rotten at the Core.</P>

The IMPROVEMENT of this Subject remains.</P>
<P>And here, <HI>My Fathers and Brethren,</HI> I would &s;olemn|ly in the Name of the great GOD, my Lord and Ma&s;ter, ask you, <HI>What you think of your State towards GOD?</HI> Pray have you a Righteou&s;ne&s;s <HI>exceeding</HI> that of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, or have you not? Pau&s;e a while, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> and let your Con&s;ciences give an impartial An&s;wer to this important Que&s;tion: O Con&s;cience! I charge thee, in the Name of the great GOD, to &s;peak the Truth: Is it &s;o, that our Righteou&s;ne&s;s mu&s;t exceed the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, upon Pain of eternal Death? O what Terror does this &s;peak to tho&s;e, who habitually <HI>fall &s;hort</HI> of their moral Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s!</P>
<P>The Phari&s;ees abounded in the <HI>Duties of Devotion:</HI> What will become of you then, who knowingly and ge|nerally neglect &s;ecret or family Devotion, or attending the Places of publick Wor&s;hip? Will not God's Wrath be pour'd out upon the Families that call not on his Name?

If the Fooli&s;hne&s;s of Preaching (<HI>i. e.</HI> a <HI>&s;imple Method</HI> of Preaching, from the Heart, without the Af|fectation of Wit or Eloquence, which is reckon'd, by the worldly Wi&s;e, Fooli&s;hne&s;s) be the appointed Mean of &s;aving tho&s;e that believe, then how &s;hall tho&s;e be &s;aved who do not attend upon it?</P>
<P>The Phari&s;ees had a great Veneration for <HI>the holy Name of GOD,</HI> and were &s;trict Ob&s;ervers of the <HI>Sabbath.</HI> What then &s;hall become of you wicked Creatures, who cu&s;tomarily prophane his holy Name, and violate his &s;a|cred Re&s;t?

<P>Were the Phari&s;ees <HI>hone&s;t, cha&s;te, charitable, zealous?</HI> Then how dreadful is your State, who fall &s;hort habitu|ally of tho&s;e Hypocrites, upon whom our Lord denounc'd &s;o many Cur&s;es?

<P>You prophane Herd of <HI>harden'd</HI> Mortals, who have not &s;o much as the outward Form of Religion: Hear, with Confu&s;ion and Trembling, your Damnation de|nounc'd by the Mouth of Chri&s;t, in the Text I am now di&s;cour&s;ing upon; <HI>For I &s;ay unto you</HI> (who am the Truth and the Life) <HI>that except your Righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall exceed the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, ye &s;hall in no Ca&s;e enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI> All ye Pub|licans and Harlots, behold your di&s;mal Doom expre&s;s'd, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.19. <HI>Imprime Verba.</HI></P>

<P>You that are but <HI>&s;lightly convinc'd,</HI> O think on the&s;e Things, in order to get your Convictions fa&s;tned and ri|vited. I am jealous over you, <HI>my dear Brethren,</HI> with a godly Jealou&s;y, lea&s;t your Convictions die away of their own Accord, or be &s;lightly heal'd. O don't re&s;t, for Chri&s;t's Sake, till Je&s;us be di&s;cover'd and apply'd to your Souls! Think often upon the Uncertainty of your Lives, the Uncertainty of the Spirit's Strivings, and the dreadful Con&s;equences of expiring Convictions, before Conver&s;ion.

He has receiv'd a Commi&s;&s;ion from his Father, to bind up the broken hearted, and to comfort the Mourners: He invites you that labour and are heavy laden to come to him, and he &s;ays he will give them Re&s;t: He is able to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t, all that come to the Father by him, and he that cometh, he &s;ays, he will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t them

Don't be di&s;courag'd upon the Account of any Op|po&s;ition that may be made again&s;t you, or Contempt that may be ca&s;t upon you, in your Way to CHRIST, either by <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> or <HI>Publicans.</HI> Some are &s;o perver&s;e that they will neither enter into the Kingdom them&s;elves, nor &s;uffer tho&s;e that are entring to enter: Methinks they might be contented with their own Damnation. <HI>Dear Brethren, and Si&s;ters!</HI> Let not tho&s;e Things di&s;may you, it is an Honour to be di&s;honour'd by &s;uch People: What are the Trifles that we can &s;uffer here, in Com|pari&s;on of the Weight of Glory before us?
