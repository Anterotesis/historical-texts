turning over Day and Night: The Heavens, the Earth and the Waters, are the Leaves of which it con&s;i&s;ts.' The Characters of the Deity are plainly legible in the whole Creation around us: And if we open the Volume of our own Nature, and look within, we find there a Law written; &mdash; a Rule of virtuous Practice pre&s;cribed.</P>
<P>RELIGION and Law (divine) are Words of promi&s;cuous U&s;e; denoting in the gene|ral Signification thereof, <HI>An Obligation lying upon Men to do tho&s;e Things which the Per|fections of God, relative unto them, do require of them.</HI> In this Definition (whether exact and full, or not,) I mean to imply all Things in|cumbent on &s;uch rea&s;onable Creatures as Men are, toward all Beings with which they are concerned, GOD, the &s;upreme, one another, and them&s;elves; and which are incumbent on them, by vertue of the Perfections of God, in the Relation there is betwixt Him and them: other Obligation which can be &s;uppo&s;ed to any of the &s;ame Things, not being of the re|ligious Kind. And in the doing tho&s;e Things to which Religion is the Obligation, are in|cluded, be&s;ides the actual Performance, the Principles, Motives and Ends thereof; all that is nece&s;&s;ary to render any Acts of Men, whe|ther internal or external, &s;uch as the Perfec|tions of the Deity require.</P>
<P>RELIGION is divided into natural and re|vealed:&mdash;<HI>Revealed</HI> Religion, is that which God hath made known to Men by the immediate

In&s;piration of his Spirit, the Declarations of his Mouth, and In&s;tructions of his Prophets: <HI>Natu|ral,</HI> that which bare Rea&s;on di&s;covers and dic|tates: As 'tis delineated by the ma&s;terly Hand of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> the Apo&s;tle of the Gentiles, in the Words of holy Scripture now read&mdash;Which I take as a proper and advantageous Introduction to my intended Di&s;cour&s;e on this Head, <HI>Viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>THAT Religion is, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, di&s;cove|rable by the Light, and practicable to the Strength, of Nature;</HI> and is &s;o far fitly called <HI>Natural</HI> by Divines and learned Men. The Religion which is po&s;&s;ible to be di&s;cover'd by the Light, and practis'd by the Power of Nature, con&s;i&s;ts in rend'ring all tho&s;e inward and outward Acts of Re&s;pect, Wor&s;hip and Obedience unto God, which are &s;uitable to the Excellence of his all-perfect Nature, and our Relation to Him, who is our Creator, Pre&s;erver, Benefactor, Lord, and Judge;&mdash; And in yielding to our Fellow-Men that Regard, Help and Comfort, which their partaking of the &s;ame Nature, and living in Society with us, give them a Claim to;&mdash; And in managing our Souls and Bodies, in their re&s;pective Actions and Enjoy|ments, in a way agreable to our <HI>Make,</HI> and conducive to our Ea&s;e and Happine&s;s: And doing all from a Sen&s;e of the Deity, impo&s;ing the Obligation, and approving the Di&s;charge of it. For 'tis a Regard to Him in every mo|ral Duty that con&s;ecrates it, and makes it truly an Act of Religion. The&s;e Things, in|deed,
<PB N="8" REF="008354_0006_102F3A8B34730C38">
are contained in the Revelation of God, which affords the chief A&s;&s;i&s;tance to our knowing and doing of them; and yet they belong to the Religion of Nature, &s;o far as Nature &s;upplies any Light and Strength to the Di&s;covery and Practice of them.</P>
<P N="1">I. THAT Religion is in &s;ome mea&s;ure, di&s;|coverable by the Light of Nature. The Obli|gation lying on us to do tho&s;e Things which the Perfections of God, as related to us, re|quire, is di&s;cernable in the Light of natural Rea&s;on. This Faculty of the human Soul, ex|erci&s;ed in the Contemplation of the univer&s;al Frame of Nature, or of any Parts thereof; and in the Ob&s;ervation of the general Cour&s;e of Providence, or of particular Events therein, may convince Men of the Exi&s;tence and Attri|butes of God, the alwi&s;e, powerful and good Maker, Upholder, and Governor of all Things. It may be que&s;tioned whether the rea&s;oning Faculty, as it is in the Bulk of Mankind, be &s;o acute and &s;trong, as from the nece&s;&s;ary eter|nal Exi&s;tence of the Deity (which is as evi|dent and inconte&s;tible, as that any Thing is) to prove all other Perfections do belong to God in an infinite Degree. If it be not ea&s;y to their Apprehen&s;ion, that the Idea of ne|ce&s;&s;ary Self-exi&s;tence includes every Perfection, and every Degree thereof, which can po&s;&s;ibly be, or which implies not a Contradiction; yet it is plain to the lowe&s;t Capacity of tho&s;e who, with a little Attention, &s;urvey the Works
<PB N="9" REF="008354_0007_102F3A8CCA959458">
of God, that He is a Being of &s;uch Perfection: And that, &s;ince He is their Maker, Owner, and Benefactor, to whom they are indebted for all that they are, and have, and on whom they depend for all they need, or can enjoy; they are bound to yield unto Him, in the Temper of their Minds, and Manner of their Behaviour, toward Him, and his Creatures they are concerned with, all that Regard which Religion founded in the Nature of God, and in the Nature of Man, and the Re|lation there is between them implies. They may perceive their Obligation to reverence, adore, and wor&s;hip a Being of &s;uch Perfection and Glory, as God is&mdash;to invoke the Almigh|ty&mdash;pray unto Him, who is able to perform all Things for them; to give Thanks to Him, from whom they receive all Ble&s;&s;ings; to aim and endeavour to plea&s;e their Lord and Ma&s;ter, to whom they are accountable for their Acti|ons, and who is ju&s;t to puni&s;h their Offences, and bountiful to reward their Services.&mdash;They may di&s;cern the Wi&s;dom and Goodne&s;s of their Maker, in de&s;igning and &s;itting them for a &s;ocial Life in this World, and thence the &s;a|cred Engagements they are under to mutual Benevolence, commutative Ju&s;tice, and all &s;uch Demeanour in their various Stations and Relations, as tends to promote the common Welfare, and the Good of Individuals.&mdash; Their Souls may know right well, how wonderfully God hath made them with Powers and Fa|culties &s;uperior to any bodily Endowments;
<PB N="10" REF="008354_0008_102F3A8F466C4980">
which &s;hould not therefore be &s;ubjected to the Sway of bruiti&s;h Appetites and blind Pa&s;&s;ions. Rea&s;on may know it's divine Right to govern, to maintain it's Empire in the Soul, regulating the Pa&s;&s;ions and Affections; directing them to proper Objects, and &s;tinting them to ju&s;t Mea&s;ures. Nature affords con&s;iderable Light for the Di&s;covery, and Arguments for the Proof, of &s;uch Parts of Religion. There is an e&s;&s;ential Difference between Good and Evil, Right and Wrong, in many Ca&s;es that relate to moral Conduct toward our Maker, Man|kind, and our&s;elves, which the Under&s;tanding (if made u&s;e of) cannot but di&s;cern. The obvious Di&s;tinction is founded in the Natures and Relations of Things: And the Obligation thence ari&s;ing to chu&s;e the Good, and do that which is Right, is not (as I conceive) antece|dent to any Law or In&s;titution, enjoining this upon us. It primarily originates from the Will and Appointment of the Author of tho&s;e Natures, and Founder of tho&s;e Relations, which are the Grounds and Rea&s;ons of it. And his Will is &s;ignified by his apparently wi&s;e and good Con&s;titution of Things, in their re&s;pec|tive Natures and Relations. The Law of Na|ture is given by the God of Nature, who is Lord of all. He enacted it by creating and e&s;tabli&s;hing a World of Beings in &s;uch Or|der, as he hath done. He publi&s;hes it to ra|tional Creatures (as is nece&s;&s;ary to it's binding them) in making them capable to learn from his Works, what is good, and what is requi|red
<PB N="11" REF="008354_0009_102F3A94867876B0">
of them. Natural Con&s;cience is his Voice, telling them their Duty. This (in part) is the <HI>work of the Law in their Hearts.</HI>&mdash;'Tis the En|gravement of it there, an&s;werable to the Writing of it on Tables, in order to it's being made known: And &s;o Men are <HI>a Law unto them&s;elves,</HI> are &s;upply'd with a Rule of Actions within their own Brea&s;ts. The Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of Nature (to adopt the Language of In&s;piration) &s;peaketh on &s;ome &s;uch wi&s;e, as doth that which is of Faith: <HI>Say not in thine Heart who &s;hall a&s;cend into Heaven; or who &s;hall de&s;cend into the Deep,</HI> to bring us the Knowledge of our Duty? <HI>The Word is nigh thee, even in thy Heart,</HI> &s;hewing thee what thou oughte&s;t to do: <HI>Con&s;cience al&s;o bearing witne&s;s,</HI> te&s;tifying for or again&s;t Men, according as they obey or di&s;obey the Word of Rea&s;on, which is the Word of God: And &s;o <HI>their Thoughts</HI>&mdash;the general Notions of Good and Evil in them, make them either to accu&s;e them&s;elves as Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of a known Law, or el&s;e excu&s;e them, as not having culpably done any Thing again&s;t it. In the due Exer|ci&s;e of their natural Faculties, Men are capa|ble of attaining &s;ome Knowledge of God's Will, and their Duty, manife&s;ted in his Works, as if it were written in legible Characters on the Tables of their Hearts. And 'tis on this Ac|count, that any Part of Religion is called Na|tural; and &s;tands di&s;tingui&s;hed, in <HI>Theology,</HI> from that which is revealed.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="12" REF="008354_0010_102F3A961E6649A0">II. THAT Religion is, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, practicable to the Strength of Nature. There is doing, as well as knowing, by Nature, the Things contained in the Law of it. Knowing them is but in order to the doing them: And the Capacity to know them would be in vain, (which nothing in Nature is) if there was no Ability to do them. Whoever ob&s;erves the divine Workman&s;hip in human Nature, and takes a Survey of the Powers and Faculties with which it is endowed, mu&s;t needs &s;ee that it was de&s;igned and framed for the Practice of Virtue: That Man is not merely &s;o much lumpi&s;h Matter, or a <HI>mechanical</HI> Engine, that moves only by the Direction of an impelling Force; but that he hath a Principle of Action within him&s;elf, and is an Agent in the &s;trict and proper Sen&s;e of the Word. The &s;pecial Endowment of his Nature, which con&s;titutes him &s;uch, is the Power of Self-determination, or Freedom of Choice; his being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of which is as &s;elf-evident, as the Explanation of the Manner of it's operating, is difficult: He feels him&s;elf free to act one Way, or ano|ther: And as he is capable of di&s;tingui&s;hing between different Actions, of the moral Kind; &s;o is he likewi&s;e of chu&s;ing which he will do, and which leave undone. Further to qualify our Nature for virtuous or religious Practice (which nece&s;&s;arily mu&s;t be of Choice) the Author of it hath annexed a &s;ecret Joy or Complacence of Mind to &s;uch Practice, and as &s;en&s;ible a Pain or Di&s;plicence to the con|trary.
<PB N="13" REF="008354_0011_102F3A97B1D1AD68">
And this inward Judgment which every one pa&s;&s;es on his own Actions, is en|forced with another Principle, which belongs more or le&s;s to our common Nature, viz. a Regard to the Judgment that is pa&s;&s;ed upon our Conduct by other Beings; e&s;pecially Be|ings who&s;e Favour or Di&s;plea&s;ure is of any Importance to us: There is a &s;ecret Satisfacti|on of Soul, which ari&s;eth from their Appro|bation; and as exqui&s;ite a Sen&s;e of Pain and Unea&s;ine&s;s from their Cen&s;ure. &mdash; The Spirit of Man being thus formed within him, it is (according to the original De&s;ign and wi&s;e Contrivance of our Maker) naturally di&s;po&s;ed toward Religion: It hath an Inclination there|to implanted in it, which under the Direction of right Rea&s;on, is an inward Spring of Mo|tion and Action, when Rea&s;on alone would not give &s;ufficient Quickne&s;s and Vigour in pur&s;uing it's Dictates.</P>
<P>THERE may be &s;omething in the intelligent moral World analogous to Attraction in the material Sy&s;tem&mdash;&s;omething that inclines and draws Men toward God, the Centre of their Perfection, and con&s;ummate Object of their Happine&s;s; and which, if it's Energy were not ob&s;tructed, would as certainly procure &s;uch Regularity in the States and Actions of all in|telligent Beings in the &s;piritual World, as that of Attraction doth in the Po&s;itions and Mo|tions of all the Bodies in the material World. &mdash; "Created intelligent Beings (&s;ays Dr. <HI>Cheyne</HI>) are Images of the SUPREME INFI|NITE,
<PB N="14" REF="008354_0012_102F3A9AFAA69E30">
as he calleth God. In Him there is an infinite De&s;ire and Ardor of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing and enjoying Him&s;elf, and his own infinite Per|fections, in order to render Him happy: He him&s;elf is the &s;ole Object of his own, and of the Felicity of all his Creatures. There mu&s;t therefore be an Image of this his infinite De|&s;ire after Happine&s;s in all his intelligent Crea|tures &mdash;a De&s;ire after Happine&s;s in a Re-union with Him. An intelligent Being, coming out of the Hands of infinite Perfection, with an Aver&s;ion, or even Indifferency, to be re|united with it's Author, the Source of it's ut|mo&s;t Felicity, is &s;uch a Shock, and Deformi|ty in the beautiful Analogy of Things, &s;uch a Breach and Gap in the harmonious Unifor|mity, ob&s;ervable in all the Works of the Al|mighty, and that in the noble&s;t and highe&s;t Part of his Works, as is not con&s;i&s;tent with fi|nite Wi&s;dom and Perfection, much le&s;s with the &s;upremely infinite Wi&s;dom of the ALL-PERFECT. &mdash; This Principle was mo&s;t cer|tainly implanted in the Creation of intelligent Beings, in the very Fund and Sub&s;tance of their Natures, th&ocirc; there remains but few Foot|&s;teps and In&s;tances of it's Being or Effects.&mdash;. It wonderfully analogi&s;es with that of Attrac|tion in the material World: As to the SU|PREME INFINITE, it may very properly be called, his <HI>Attraction</HI> of them; and as to them, their <HI>Central Tendency,</HI> or Gravitation (&s;o to &s;peak) toward Him." This Tendency in human Nature, which that penetrating En|quirer
<PB N="15" REF="008354_0013_102F3A9DB842E888">
into both the con&s;tituent Parts of it, accurately ob&s;erves, is an Inclination to Reli|gion &mdash;to many Offices and Acts of it, by which Men return and re-unite to the Author of their Beings; who hath &s;o made all Nations of them, that they &s;hould &s;eek the Lord, if haply they might <HI>feel after him, and find him.</HI> There is in the common Nature, which all partake of, a Propen&s;ion to Acts, not only of human Kindne&s;s, but al&s;o of divine Wor&s;hip; which excites to the Performance of them, when proper Occa&s;ions of doing them occur, without previous, expre&s;s Deliberation and Determination concerning them: And to for|bear them is a painful Re&s;traint upon Nature; and to do the contrary, is thwarting it's Incli|nation, and wre&s;ting it from it's Bent.&mdash; There is ob&s;ervable in Man <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> a <HI>natural Procli|vity</HI> (as <HI>Origen</HI> termeth it) towards his Maker; to acknowledge God; e&s;pecially on Occa|&s;ions of Need or Di&s;tre&s;s to have recour&s;e unto Him. And from hence ari&s;eth &s;o univer&s;al a Con&s;ent of Mankind in paying &s;ome Homage to the Deity, which is not always directed to the true, becau&s;e &s;o many blindly follow na|tural Inclination, without con&s;ulting Rea&s;on, which &s;hould be it's Guide. There is &s;uch a Di&s;po&s;ition in human Nature as makes Reli|gion agreable to it; &s;o that Divines of great Name have affirm'd it to be e&s;&s;ential thereto, and that which rai&s;es it above the Brutal; and Philo&s;ophers, from what is innate to Man, have
<PB N="16" REF="008354_0014_102F3AA2A9CD04F0">
defined him a <HI>Creature capable of Religion.</HI>&mdash; Whoever attends to this inward Furniture of our Nature for Religion, may ea&s;ily perceive it to be God's Workman&s;hip, primarily crea|ted unto good Works, that Men might walk in them. His Formation of them qualifys them, in a mea&s;ure, for religious Practice; as his Regeneration, or Renovation of them doth more &s;o. And his fitting them by Nature therefor, is a Work of his, to which the Work of Sanctification, in his furni&s;hing them with Grace to evangelical Obedience, beareth Ana|logy. The former is the Work of the Law written in their Hearts, that they may do, as well as know, what it enjoins: The latter is the Impre&s;&s;ion of the Go&s;pel upon them, that, thro' Chri&s;t's &s;trengthening them, they may do what it requires. And by doing the Things contained in the Law of Nature, Men <HI>&s;hew the Work of the Law written in their Hearts, and are a Law unto them&s;elves,</HI> as truly and plainly, as regenerate Chri&s;tians, by doing the Things contained in the Go&s;pel, are <HI>mani|fe&s;tly declared to be the Epi&s;tle of Chri&s;t, writ|ten, not with Ink, but with the Spirit of the li|ving God, not in Tables of Stone, but in fle&s;hly Tables of the Heart.</HI> The Scriptures thus de|&s;cribing the Religion of Nature and of Chri&s;t, clearly di&s;tingui&s;h between them; as the for|mer may be practi&s;ed by the Strength of Na|ture, and the latter by the Strength of Chri&s;t, &mdash; his Spirit helping the Infirmities of our Na|ture.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="008354_0015_102F3AA6F4462808">How far the Duties of Religion are po&s;&s;ible to be performed by the Strength of Nature, in a lap&s;ed State; and to what Mea&s;ure of divine Approbation and Acceptance, Rea&s;on, unenlightned by Revelation, may not be able to determine.&mdash;The Law of Nature is purely a Law of Works, and requires perfect Obedi|ence, which the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of it, as all Men are, cannot yield to it: And whether that which is wanting in their Obedience, may be &s;upplied by Repentance and Humility in them, and by Mercy and Pardon in God, cannot be certainly known without a Reve|lation of his Will, on which it wholly depends. The Goodne&s;s of God, in the general Cour&s;e of his Providence, toward &s;inful Mankind, &s;heweth Him to be placable, and leadeth them to Repentance; but doth not a&s;&s;ure them of Pardon upon it, much le&s;s of the Re|ward of eternal Life, for imperfect, tho' it &s;hould be &s;incere, Obedience. If Rea&s;on doth not &s;ee and pronounce it incon&s;i&s;tent with the Perfections of God to pardon Sin|ners, on the &s;ole Condition of their Repen|tance; yet it cannot infer from them, that he will:&mdash;All that it can &s;ay, is in the Words of a Heathen King, <HI>Who can tell if the Lord will turn from his Anger, that we peri&s;h not?</HI> Such Inducement they may have to repent, and turn from their evil Ways:&mdash;And it may far|ther encourage them to better Obedience, by &s;ugge&s;ting the Con&s;ideration which may be had by a merciful God of the Frailty of their

Nature, and the gracious Allowances He may po&s;&s;ibly make them, who&s;e Strength, &s;o weak|ned as it is, cannot reach the Heighth of their Duty. In the Pre&s;cription of Duty, 'tis not unrea&s;onable, that what may be required, even in Rigour, &s;hould be preci&s;ely determined, th&ocirc; in Execution of Ju&s;tice, or Di&s;pen&s;ation of Recompence, Con&s;ideration may be had of our Weakne&s;s; whereby both the Authority of our Governor may be pre&s;erved, and his Clemency glorified. Men's Thoughts or Con|&s;ciences accu&s;ing them for the Violation of the Law of Nature, implies a Fear which is not groundle&s;s, that they &s;hall be brought into Judgment: And their Thoughts excu&s;ing and approving of them for doing, in &s;ome Mea|&s;ure, what the Law requires, implies a Hope, which may not be altogether vain, that they &s;hall be accepted. Th&ocirc; it &s;hould be, as one &s;aith, "That all the moral Virtues are &s;o ma|ny Cyphers&mdash;unavailing Nothings, unle&s;s the Deity be placed as the principal Figure at the Head of them;" yet if practi&s;ed out of any Sen&s;e of Duty to God, and with a View to plea|&s;ing Him, as it is po&s;&s;ible they may be, and have been, &s;hall we &s;ay, they are meerly &s;plendid Vices in his Eyes; and that the mo&s;t humble Prayers of natural Men are Bla&s;phemies in his Ears?

who is the Author of it. It is only by Grace that &s;inful Men can be &s;aved; yet, by making &s;ome good U&s;e of their rational Powers (weakened as they be) in the Study and Practice of natural Religion, they may be in a better Preparation of Mind to comply with the Offers and Operations of divine Grace, than if they wholly give up them&s;elves to the Conduct of &s;en&s;ual Appetites &amp; Pa&s;&s;ions. Whe|ther tho&s;e Offers &amp; Operations of divine Grace are de&s;igned for, and ever vouch&s;afed to &s;uch as are not favoured with Revelation; and it be po&s;&s;ible for them to obtain Mercy, in the Day when God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hall judge the Things which they have done, <HI>according to the Go&s;pel;</HI> is a Point which Revelation only can determine; and is not my Province to di&s;cu&s;s.</P>
<P>IN the Preference we give to revealed Re|ligion, we &s;hould not for the &s;ake of any par|ticular Truth we apprehend to be deliver'd in it, ha&s;tily renounce a Principle of natural Religion, &s;eeming contrary thereto.

No Doctrine, or Scheme of Religion, &s;hould be advanced, or received as &s;criptural and divine, which is plainly and ab|&s;olutely

incon&s;i&s;tent with the Perfections of God, and the Po&s;&s;ibility of Things. Ab&s;urdi|ties and Contradictions (from which few hu|man Schemes are entirely free) are not to be obtruded upon our Faith. No Pretence of Revelation can be &s;ufficient for the Admi&s;&s;ion of them. The manife&s;t Ab&s;urdity of any Doctrine, is a &s;tronger Argument that it is not of God, than any other Evidence can be that it is. "A Revelation mu&s;t be agreable to the Nature of God, and Po&s;&s;ibility of Things." We are not ra&s;hly to determine concerning one that it is not &s;o, becau&s;e we don't ea&s;ily and clearly &s;ee it to be &s;o: Nor plead that any may be &s;o, which contradicts all our natural Ideas of the Attributes of God. To &s;ay, in Defence of any religious Tenets, reduced to Ab&s;urdity, that the Perfections of God, his Holine&s;s, Ju&s;tice, Goodne&s;s, are quite different Things in Him, from what, in an infinitely lower Degree, they are in Men, is to overthrow all Religion both natural and re|vealed; and make our Faith, as well as Rea|&s;on vain.&mdash; For, if we have no right Notions of the Deity, (as 'tis certain upon this Sup|po&s;ition, we have none,) as we wor&s;hip, &s;o we believe, we know not what, or why. We don't know what Re&s;pects are due from us to the Perfections of God; or that any are requi|red of us by Him.

To &s;et the Gifts of God at variance, is to fru&s;trate the good De&s;ign and deprive our&s;elves of the Benefit of them.

<P N="2">2. WE &s;hould not magnify and extol natu|ral Religion, to the Di&s;paragement of Re|vealed.

At the fir&s;t opening of his Eyes and Under&s;tanding, he might not by one intuitive View, have a clear and full Di&s;cern|ment of the Perfections of God &s;tamped on his Works, and the moral Obligations engra|ved in his Heart.&mdash; God made Him&s;elf and

There was &s;ome <HI>other</HI> Voice of the Lord, be&s;ide that of univer|&s;al Nature's declaring his Being and Plea|&s;ure to him; and by which more might be &s;poken for his In&s;truction, than we have an Account of in the Mo&s;aick Hi&s;tory. And per|haps &s;uch Manife&s;tation as God more imme|diately made of Him&s;elf to Man, put his Rea|&s;on in Exerci&s;e for all the Di&s;coveries it was capable of making afterwards from the Works of Creation. Had Man, with all his natu|ral Endowments in their perfect Order and Strength, been placed in this World, and no Notice given him of it's Maker, might he not have &s;tood wondring &s;ome Time at the ama|zing Fabrick, before he would have thence, by Deductions of Rea&s;on, argued an invi&s;ible Being, of eternal Power, Wi&s;dom and Good|ne&s;s, to be the Author of it and him; to whom he was therefore obliged to pay all Regards &s;uitable to &s;uch glorious Excellencies? Would he &s;o &s;oon and ea&s;ily have made tho&s;e Di&s;co|veries, which are nece&s;&s;ary to the Perfection of natural Religion, under&s;tood and practic'd by him in Paradi&s;e, till he eat of <HI>the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil?</HI> If his be|ing Created after the Image of God imports more, than his Formation with a &s;ufficient Capacity in his Nature for, and entire Di&s;po|&s;ition to, even the actual Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and U&s;e of all that Knowledge, Righteou&s;ne&s;s and true Holine&s;s, of which the Religion of Nature,

con&s;i&s;ts; yet his falling into Sin, and effacing the divine Image in his Soul, greatly alter'd the Ca&s;e, with re&s;pect to him, and his Po&s;te|rity, and made Revelation a nece&s;&s;ary Sup|plement of &s;upernatural Light and Strength, for the Di&s;covery and Performance of accep|table and available Religion. And &s;uch a Re|velation, in it's fir&s;t Degree and early Dawn of it, was graciou&s;ly vouch&s;afed to Man, upon his Fall into a State of Darkne&s;s and Weak|ne&s;s, Sin and Mi&s;ery. &mdash; Which Revelation continued, and gradually encrea&s;ed, to the Church of God in all pa&s;t Ages of it from the Beginning, hath done more to pre&s;erve and propagate that little even of natural Religion, which there hath been among Mankind, than all the boa&s;ted Improvements of Nature's dimmed Light, and enfeebled Powers have done. The fir&s;t Parents of Mankind, no doubt, in&s;tructed their Children in the Principles and Duties of Religion, not only tho&s;e which con|cern'd them as &s;inful Creatures, and are founded in the new and encouraging Relations God &s;tands in to us, which the Go&s;pel, publi&s;hed in Paradi&s;e, reveals, but al&s;o in tho&s;e which are comprehended in the Law of their Creation: Otherwi&s;e they might not &s;oon enough, if ever, have arriv'd to a competent Knowledge of them. It might have been long, e're Rea|&s;on, uncultivated by Education, would by &s;earching, have found out God &mdash; &s;o much as that He is. Perhaps of it's own natural Motion, now become &s;o dull and &s;tupid, it
<PB N="26" REF="008354_0024_102F3AC29B11BBB8">
would not have enquired after Him, or have proceeded far in the Di&s;covery of Him. To a traditionary Revelation, how imperfect and ob&s;cure &s;oever, among&s;t mo&s;t Nations that have dwelt on the Face of the Earth, might be owing the Knowledge they had of God, and divine Things:&mdash; At lea&s;t the Hint thus given them of &s;uch Things, might awake their rational Powers to any Exerci&s;e about them, which otherwi&s;e might have lain dor|mant in their benighted Minds.</P>
<P>REASON, as well as Revelation, teacheth us, that human Nature, in it's original Con&s;ti|tution, and as it came out of the Hands of a good Creator, mu&s;t be Perfect in it's Kind, and that it &s;ince, by our Abu&s;e of it, is wofully impaired. It might not approach quite &s;o near the Angelical, yea, Divine Nature in it's integral State, as &s;ome imagine; nor might it by the Sin of the <HI>Protopla&s;t</HI> fall quite &s;o low, as others affirm; and become a &s;trange hete|rogeneous Compound of two other Natures, retaining nothing of Humanity in it. The &s;uperior Excellency and Strength of innocent <HI>Adam</HI>'s Soul, might not be &s;o much above the common Standard, &s;ince, as the <HI>Talmudi&s;ts</HI> de|&s;cribe his bodily Stature&mdash;&s;o Tall, that, &s;tand|ing on the Earth, he could touch the Heavens with his Hand; yet it doubtle&s;s had every way the Advantage for the free and &s;ublime Exerci&s;es of a rational Soul. Some appear to have an extravagantly high Opinion, and o|thers a too deba&s;ing Notion of human Nature,
<PB N="27" REF="008354_0025_102F3AC5A497C858">
even in it's lap&s;ed E&s;tate: There are &s;till in it, as received by Derivation from apo&s;tate Pa|rents, "&s;ome <HI>legible Characters, Out-lines,</HI> and <HI>Lineaments</HI> of it's Beauty; &s;ome <HI>magnificent Ruins,</HI> which &s;hew what it had been, enough to demon&s;trate the original Impre&s;&s;ion of the divine Image and Law." It is, however di&s;|order'd and debilitated, a rational Nature, ca|pable of religious Knowledge and Practice. But can we gue&s;s, how much thereof it would attain to, in the &s;hort Time of this Life, if it were left altogether uncultivated in Individu|als; and Mankind had run wild, like the Bea&s;ts of the Field? How much more would the Generality of 'em know, than what they know as <HI>natural brute Bea&s;ts?</HI> and in tho&s;e Things have corrupted them&s;elves: The higher Pow|ers of their Nature not exerting them&s;elves for the fir&s;t Years of their Lives, and &s;o the more &s;ubjected to the Sway of the inferior, might be of little U&s;e toward the Di&s;covery and Performance of the Things of Religion: Any innate Inclination to them might be &s;mo|thered in the Crowd of worldly Lu&s;ts; the Attention of the Mind diverted from them, and all the E&s;&s;ays to do them, be hindered by the Amu&s;ements of &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ure, the En|croachments of &s;ecular Bu&s;ine&s;s, the Preva|lence of bad Cu&s;toms and Examples. The Capacities with which they are made, the Principles with which they are endowed, in order to their knowing of, and acting agrea|ble to, moral Obligations, might be &s;uppre&s;|&s;ed,

and kept down by violent Appetites and Pa&s;&s;ions, and lie buried under earthly Affec|tions. Men might have been ab&s;olutely with|out God in the World;&mdash; without any Sen&s;e of the Deity upon theit Minds; without all Thought of any other Things than &s;uch as were ju&s;t before them.

<P>THUS much, I think, may be probably inferred from the Hi&s;tory of all Ages of the World, in which the Nations which have not enjoyed the Revelation which God from Time to Time granted to his Church, have had &s;o little of Natural Religion among them, mixed and &s;poiled with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Errors, Super&s;titions, and Abominations. The Glim|merings of Nature's Light, and &s;mall Remains of it's Strength, not being duly improved, were, in a manner, lo&s;t from among them, and they <HI>&s;at in Darkne&s;s, and the Region of the Shadow of Death:</HI> Th&ocirc; what might be known of God, was manife&s;t to them in his Works; and they had moreover &s;ome ob|&s;cure Traditions, which gave Ri&s;e to their heatheni&s;h Wor&s;hip, and according to which they ordered the Rites of it. While we are amaz'd at the Stupidity which they labour'd
<PB N="29" REF="008354_0027_102F3AC8E65CFBE0">
under in their rea&s;onable Faculties, it &s;heweth us what is to be expected from &s;avage, un|di&s;ciplined Nature. We do not argue there|from the Incapacity of human Rea&s;on, under all the Di&s;advantages of our lap&s;ed State, to know and do better; but the Inefficacy of it, in fact, to the Purpo&s;es of Religion, when una&s;&s;i&s;ted by Revelation.&mdash;And were it not for this, we may gue&s;s what a deplorable State of Ignorance and Wickedne&s;s, increa&s;ing from one Age to another, all Mankind would have been in at this Day. What hath poli&s;hed Nature and refined Rea&s;on to boa&s;t of, in Matters of Religion, among the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t learned of the Heathens? Did they <HI>by Wi&s;dom know God, and glorify Him as God.</HI> Did <HI>Athens,</HI> that Eye of the World, &s;ee the <HI>invi&s;ible Things of Him,</HI> made vi&s;ible enough in his Works to the Eye of human Under|&s;tanding, <HI>even his eternal Power and God-head?</HI> The Altar erected there to the UNKNOWN GOD, was a Monument of their Ignorance of the true. If they wor&s;hipped Him at all, they <HI>did it ignorantly, and were in all Things too &s;uper&s;titious.</HI> Was the State of natural Religion better at <HI>Rome,</HI> when Learning flouri&s;hed there, than that of the Chri&s;tian is, now Popery prevails?

and, <HI>&s;erving the Creature, more than the Crea|tor;</HI> and approving and doing tho&s;e Things that are contrary, not only to the Religion, but even the Inclination of Nature. &mdash; Under much Doubt and Uncertainty have the able&s;t Writers of them left the fir&s;t Principles of Natural Religion. It is enough (&s;aith one) to rai&s;e the Pity of a Chri&s;tian, when he reads <HI>Cicero</HI>'s Di&s;cour&s;e of the <HI>Nature of the Gods,</HI> to find the Di&s;putants fighting in the dark, puzzling them&s;elves, and one another, con|founding Truth and Error; and at la&s;t draw|ing off almo&s;t on equal Terms without Vic|tory's declaring on either Side.&mdash;Not to men|tion the Deficiencies and Errors in any Scheme of Natural Religion, which the learned Hea|then ever pre&s;ented the World with; I may &s;ay, that the Chri&s;tian Revelation contains one far more entire and &s;atisfying.

And 'tis not without Rea&s;on &s;uppo&s;ed, that they would not have been propounded &s;o clearly and ful|ly as they be, in the mo&s;t celebrated Writings of Morality among the Heathen, had there been none of divine In&s;piration among the People of God.</P>

which they decry. Not to &s;ay any Thing of tho&s;e heavenly Truths and impor|tant Duties, which are taught only in the Bible; 'tis there we learn the Religion of Na|ture in it's greate&s;t Purity; which, if there were nothing more to be &s;aid in it's Commen|dation might be enough to rai&s;e our E&s;teem of it. And the Grace of God appears in a&s;|&s;i&s;ting Rea&s;on by Revelation in tho&s;e Di&s;|coveries, which it po&s;&s;ibly could, but never did, nor would make, without &s;uch Help. &mdash; And the &s;ame is true, with re&s;pect to the Per|formances of Duty: <HI>In thy Light we &s;ee Light.</HI> It is in the Light of Revelation, added to that of Nature, that Things are &s;o plain and ea&s;y to our di&s;cerning, as that we are ready to think bare Rea&s;on mu&s;t di&s;cover them to all Mankind, and that we, un-enlightned by the Go&s;pel, &s;hould have known as much of the Principles and Duties of Natural Religion. But, if we are thence in&s;en&s;ible of, and un|thankful for, <HI>the tender Mercy of our God,</HI> whereby <HI>the Day-&s;pring from on High hath vi&s;ited us,</HI> we are &s;tupidly incon&s;iderate; and need not (as we are apt) to &s;mile at the odd Philo&s;ophy of the &s;imple <HI>Ru&s;tick,</HI> who thought the World had little Benefit by the Light of the Sun, "Becau&s;e it &s;hin'd in the Day-time." By Means of Revelation we have the right U&s;e of Rea&s;on, in Matters of Religion: And, by the due Exerci&s;e of Rea&s;on, &s;o excited and directed, we have the ine&s;timable Benefit of Revelation.

<P>He was born at <HI>Roxbury</HI> in the Year 1675, was the Grand&s;on of THOMAS DUDLEY, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> one of the fir&s;t Governors of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> Colony, and the elde&s;t &s;urviving Son of the late Governor DUDLEY, to who&s;e

E&s;tate, as he was principal Heir, &s;o he inherited a large Share of tho&s;e &s;uperior Talents that enrich'd the Mind of that great and accompli&s;h'd Gentleman.</P>
<P>At the Age of eleven Years he was found qualified for an Admi&s;&s;ion into <HI>Harvard</HI>-College, where he pro|ceeded Batchelor of Arts in the Year 1690, and Ma&s;|ter of Arts in the Year 1693. Soon after which he went over to <HI>England,</HI> and was enter'd a Student in the Inner-Temple. After he had fini&s;hed his Studies there, and had been called to the Bar, he return'd to his native Country, to the Service of which he had early devoted him&s;elf.</P>
<P>As his natural Endowments were uncommon, &s;o he had abundantly furni&s;hed his Mind by great Read|ing and clo&s;e Study. His Knowledge (far from being confin'd to the Law) was great in mo&s;t Parts of Litera|ture: He was well ver&s;ed in Natural Philo&s;ophy; an honourable Proof of which was his being a Member of the ROYAL SOCIETY: He had thoroughly &s;tudied Divinity: And in Hi&s;tory, both civil and &s;acred, he had &s;carce an equal. The&s;e were &s;ome of the Accom|pli&s;hments which &s;o well qualified him for public Ser|vice, which was the con&s;tant Bu&s;ine&s;s of his Life.</P>
<P>Upon his Return to <HI>New-England</HI> he was appointed Attorney-General for the Province, and for &s;everal Years he &s;erved the Public in that Capacity. He was &s;ome time a Repre&s;entative for his native Town in the General Court; and &s;ate for many Years at the Coun|cil-Board: In all which important Offices he acquitted him&s;elf with great Fidelity and Honour. But it was in the Seat of Ju&s;tice he was mo&s;t generally known, and therefore mo&s;t admir'd. To that he was advanc|ed in the Year 1718, being then appointed one of the Ju&s;tices of the Superior Court, of which, upon the
<PB N="3" REF="008354_0035_102F3AE0AA0ACD58">
Death of the Honourable Judge LYNDE, he was com|mi&s;&s;ionated the Chief-Ju&s;tice: And in this high and important Station he &s;erved the Province till his Death. Here it was that he di&s;play'd &s;o eminently his admirable Talents, e&s;pecially his quick Apprehen&s;ion, his un|common Strength of Memory, and exten&s;ive Know|ledge; and at the &s;ame time his great Abhorrence of Vice, together with that impartial Ju&s;tice which neither re&s;pected the Rich, nor countenanced the Poor Man in his Cau&s;e. Thus while with pure Hands and an up|right Heart he admini&s;tred Ju&s;tice in his Circuit through the Province, he gain'd the general E&s;teem and Vene|ration of the People. As his Pre&s;ence always com|manded Re&s;pect, &s;o it might ju&s;tly be &s;aid of him that he &s;catter'd Iniquity with his Eyes, which &s;truck with Awe the mo&s;t daring Offenders. When he &s;pake, it was with &s;uch Authority and peculiar Energy of Ex|pre&s;&s;ion, as never fail'd to command Attention, and deeply impre&s;s the Minds of all who heard him; and his Sentiments of Law and Evidence in all Cau&s;es before the Court, had generally a determining Weight with tho&s;e who were charged with the Trial of them.</P>
<P>The Powers of his Mind retain'd their Vigour to a remakable Degree in his advanced Age; though he la|bour'd under great Indi&s;po&s;itions of Body: The&s;e were often heavy upon him while attending the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the Court, which perhaps occa&s;ioned his di&s;co|vering &s;ome Impatience, when Arguments at the Bar were drawn out to a great Length, and his expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf with &s;ome Appearance of Severity: But if hereby he gave any Di&s;gu&s;t in public, he made full A|mends for it in private; where all who enjoy'd his Company were charm'd with his entertaining and pro|lite Conver&s;ation: For, with all his other Accompli&s;h|ments, he had naturally a mo&s;t happy Turn for Con|ver&s;ation; in which he always &s;hew'd the Gentleman, the Scholar, and the Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="008354_0036_102F17FCDD609588">As he early made a Profe&s;&s;ion of the Chri&s;tian Reli|gion, &s;o he was ever careful to adorn it by a &s;uitable Conduct in the &s;everal Relations of Life. He always expre&s;s'd a tender Concern for the Intere&s;ts of his Country, both civil and religious, and greatly lamented any ill-boding A&s;pects upon either. He was a Friend and Patron to Men of Learning and Religion, e&s;peci|ally to the Clergy, to whom he always &s;hew'd a parti|cular Re&s;pect. The Intere&s;ts of our College he tender|ly regarded while he lived; and at his Death he en|rich'd it by a generous Donation.</P>
<P>All who had the Honour of an Acquaintance with him and his Family, knew him to be one of the mo&s;t tender Hu&s;bands, a kind and indulgent Ma&s;ter, a good Neighbour, and an affectionate Friend. As in his own Hou&s;e his Behaviour was truly exemplary; &s;o he was an eminent Pattern of ju&s;t Deportment in the Hou&s;e of GOD: His unaffected Gravity and devout Attention, while engag'd in Divine Service there, &s;hew'd him to be what he was at Heart, a Man of real Religion. This Religion was his Support and Com|fort in the Hour of Death. He had the Exerci&s;e of his Rea&s;on during the whole of his Sickne&s;s; and all along di&s;cover'd that Humility, Patience, Charity and Con|fidence in his GOD and SAVIOUR, which one would wi&s;h to &s;ee in a dying Friend.</P>
<P>His vertuous Con&s;ort, (to whom he owed no &s;mall Part of the Happine&s;s of his Life,) was one of the Daughters of Colonel JOHN WAINWRIGHT of <HI>Ip&s;wich.</HI> By her he had &s;everal Children, who all died in their Infancy. This Lady &s;till lives to deplore her great Lo&s;s, and mingle her Tears with tho&s;e of the Public.</P>
