<P>AT the reque&s;t of the worthy author of the fol|lowing e&s;&s;ays, I have peru&s;ed them; and ob&s;erve nothing in them, but what is agreable to the &s;acred &s;cripture, to the form of &s;ound words, to the analogy of faith, and the doctrine of the go&s;pel; and cannot but be of opinion, that they may be u&s;eful to illu&s;trate and confirm the doctrines of grace, to re&s;olve the doubts and remove the difficulties which may attend many with re&s;pect to &s;ome things herein handled; be|ing wrote with clearne&s;s of thought, &s;oundne&s;s of judg|ment, and &s;trength of argument: And as &s;uch I hear|tily recommend them to the peru&s;al of every enquirer after truth; and that they may be of u&s;e to in&s;truct the ignorant, to ea&s;e the minds of doubting Chri&s;tians, to &s;trengthen the weak and e&s;tabli&s;h the wavering in the truth of the go&s;pel, is the hearty de&s;ire of him, that wi&s;hes well to the &s;ouls of men, and to the intere&s;t of the Redeemer.</P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON THE STATE of MAN, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Of the Creation of Man, and God the Creator.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN God had created the heavens with all their ho&s;ts, and the earth with the va|rious creatures in it, the &s;ea and all that therein is, la&s;t of all he made man. <HI>And God &s;aid, let us make man&mdash;And the Lord God for|med man out of the du&s;t of the earth,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Gen.</HI> i. 26. ii. 28.</P>
<P>Man is the crown and glory of this lower creation. <HI>Thou ha&s;t made man a little lower than the angels and ha&s;t crowned him with glory and honour,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> viii. 5.

of man, is very exact and beautiful. <HI>I will prai&s;e thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; marvellous are thy works, and that my <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> knoweth right well,</HI> P&s;al. cxxxix. 14.</P>
<P>Query,&mdash;<HI>If God be the creator and maker of man, and man is born into the world a corrupt creature, both filthy and guilty in his &s;ight, is not he the author of this corruption and depravity? Are not all men, when born into the world, as God made them?</HI> An&s;wer: I believe God is the creator of man, both body and &s;oul; every per&s;on that comes into the world receives his breath and being from him: I al&s;o believe that every &s;on and daughter of <HI>Adam</HI> is born into the world a corrupt, depraved creature, and guilty in the &s;ight of God, being <HI>&s;hapen in iniquity, and conceived in &s;in. And by the offence of one, Judgment came upon all men to condemnation,</HI> P&s;al. li. 5. Rom. v. 18. But God is not the author of that corruption; nor is he unju&s;t in pa&s;&s;ing the &s;entence of <HI>condemnation upon all mankind,</HI> for that fir&s;t &s;in of <HI>Adam.</HI> In &s;ome re&s;pects it may be &s;aid, God is the remote cau&s;e of every thing; <HI>for in him all live, move, and have their being,</HI> Acts xvii. 28. No per&s;on can move, or act, but as he is &s;upported and uphold by God, who gives him &s;trength to move and act.</P>
<P>But, the doing an action wrong, is not from God, but the creature, and proceeds from the corruption of human nature. We mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h between an action, and the evil of the action; for the &s;ame action may be good or bad; good, if done according to the rule, and as God hath commanded; bad, or evil, if done contrary to it.</P>
<P>For in&s;tance, &s;peech, or &s;peaking, is an action which may be good or bad; to &s;peak the truth, is a good action; but to &s;peak a fal&s;hood, or tell a lie, is an evil
<PB N="7" REF="007860_0006_102DE93CAE0DBFC8">
one: therefore, though the act may, in &s;ome re&s;pect, be a&s;cribed to God, yet the evil of the action cannot.</P>
<P>The &s;un, when it &s;hines upon a dunghill, will ex|hale, or draw from thence, a di&s;agreable &s;mell; now, though the &s;un be the remote cau&s;e of the dunghill's &s;ending forth &s;uch a nau&s;eous &s;team, yet it is not the immediate cau&s;e of it; none can ju&s;tly blame the &s;un, but the dunghill, which is the chief and immediate cau&s;e, being made up of &s;uch matter as contains in it&s;elf that di&s;agreable &s;mell; the &s;un only di&s;covers what is in the dunghill, it puts nothing into it.</P>
<P>But, to an&s;wer more directly; man's body and &s;oul, as to the e&s;&s;ence of both, are from God, and we ought to ble&s;s him for all our natural powers and faculties, of body and mind; but &s;hould take care we do not ex|alt human nature &s;o as to make a Saviour unnece&s;&s;ary. We mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the corruption of human nature is no part of it; 'tis what cleaves fa&s;t to it, but is no part of it; 'tis conveyed by generation, but doth not con&s;titute our being, nor any part of it; it is no part either of the &s;oul, or of the body: Man, before he &s;in|ned and fell, had the &s;ame members of body, and facul|ties of &s;oul, that he hath now. Therefore, God may be and is, the creator of man, both body and &s;oul, and yet not the author of that corruption which cleaves to him, but is no part of him. But, &s;uppo&s;e there be a my&s;tery in it, &s;hall we, therefore, deny it? and, becau&s;e we cannot fully comprehend it, &s;hall we not believe it? Should we take this liberty in &s;ome other matters, we mu&s;t ca&s;t away &s;ome of the fundamental doctrines of Chri&s;tianity; and, in things natural, mu&s;t reject &s;ome that we know to be true, &s;uch as we cannot fully ex|plain the manner of. For in&s;tance, is there not a my&s;|tery in the union of the &s;oul and body? One might
<PB N="8" REF="007860_0007_102DE93F714B1078">
a&s;k, how are the &s;oul and body united? By what &s;ecret ties and bands are they knit together? When the time, and what the mode of this union, who can conceive or fully explain? And yet who dares deny that &s;o it is?</P>
<P>And is it not equally as evident, that the nature of man is corrupted? or how &s;hall we account for tho&s;e irregular pa&s;&s;ions in little children? whence tho&s;e early buddings of &s;in, tho&s;e youthful follies? And are not pain, &s;ickne&s;s, and death, the lot of many in their in|fancy, before they have committed actual &s;in? Would the&s;e things be thus, if the nature of man was pure when born into the world? and is it not &s;peaking phi|lo&s;ophically, when we &s;ay, <HI>like begets like?</HI> and is it not al&s;o &s;peaking &s;cripturally, when we a&s;k, <HI>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?</HI> not one, <HI>Job</HI> xiv. 4.</P>
<P>As God made man, &s;o he made him an upright and perfect creature; God never made any thing otherwi&s;e than pure and perfect. In the account <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> gives us of the creation in general, he tells us, that <HI>God &s;aw it was good,</HI> Gen. i. 10, 12. But when God had fini&s;hed his works, and took a view of them, he pro|nounced <HI>All very good,</HI> Gen. i. 31. Never any thing came out of God's hand with the lea&s;t &s;tain or blemi&s;h upon it: <HI>He is a rock, his work is perfect,</HI> Deut. xxxii. 4. God is the author of all rectitude and holi|ne&s;s, that is or ever was in angels or men; all the in|dowments <HI>Adam</HI> had in his innocency, was the be&s;tow|ment of heaven; the purity and rectitude wherewith he was adorned, was a tran&s;cript of the divine image. God is the &s;ource and fountain of all holine&s;s; and if any of the fallen and &s;inful race of <HI>Adam,</HI> have on them the glorious and ble&s;&s;ed image of God, it is the Lords work and free donation, <HI>Eph.</HI> iv. 24. <HI>Col.</HI> iii.
<PB N="9" REF="007860_0008_102DE941F9851518">
10. Holine&s;s is in God e&s;&s;entially, but in the creature it is derived; and a rational being may exi&s;t without it, as the apo&s;tate angels do, and fallen man till he is re|&s;tored: it is what God puts into the creature, a re|&s;emblance to his glorious &s;elf; and, it may be truly affirmed, that God cannot make a rea&s;onable being, without making it in his own image. It is no ways marvellous that God, when he makes a rational being, &s;hould make it in his own image; but, it is very &s;tu|pendous, that when the creature man had lo&s;t the image of God, he &s;hould put it on him again. God was at liberty to make man or not, but not at liberty to make him holy or unholy; this were to &s;uppo&s;e God capable of erring, and &s;o doing what he hates in others, which were bla&s;phemy once to think: but when man had lo&s;t the image of God, he was at li|berty whether he would imprint it on him again; and the imprinting it on any, is an act of his mere &s;overeign grace and unmerited love.</P>
<P><HI>God made man upright. And God &s;aid, let us make man in our own image, after our likene&s;s,</HI> &amp;c. Gen. i. 26. It doth not &s;eem con&s;i&s;tent with the per|fections of God, that he &s;hould make any order or rank of beings, without imprinting on them his image, a re&s;emblance of his moral perfections; endowing them with &s;uch powers and abilities, which, if rightly improved, are &s;ufficient to &s;uch a creature's &s;tanding. And it mu&s;t be maintained, that <HI>Adam</HI> had &s;ufficient powers and abilities to &s;tand; it was not for want of power that he fell, but for want of exerci&s;ing the power he had aright; the &s;ame my be affirmed of the fallen angels.</P>
<P>To &s;uppose a creature puni&s;hed for apo&s;tatizing from its maker, it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uppo&s;e al&s;o, that
<PB N="10" REF="007860_0009_102DE9447B2E1DB0">
that creature had power to &s;tand in the &s;tate in which it was made; or otherwi&s;e the puni&s;hment would not be ju&s;t; for to puni&s;h the creature for a fault it could not avoid, is acting again&s;t all rea&s;on and ju&s;tice. But if the creature's apo&s;tatizing from the Creator, be the effect of an abu&s;e of the power which the creature had; this being the fault of the creature, may very ju&s;tly be puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>Query,&mdash;<HI>If it be &s;o, that it is unju&s;t to puni&s;h a creature for a fault, or faults, it cannot avoid; how then can God in ju&s;tice puni&s;h mankind for their di&s;o|bedience to his law, if man in this pre&s;ent fallen &s;tate has lo&s;t the power to obey or keep the law, and it does not plea&s;e God to re&s;tore this power, to man again?</HI></P>
<P>An&s;wer: That man has lo&s;t the power he once had to keep the law of God, and is now become weak, yea quite void of &s;piritual &s;trength, is an undeniable truth, if the &s;criptures are to be taken as a rule of our faith; for thus it is written, <HI>For when we were yet without &s;trength, in due time Chri&s;t died for the ungodly. And the carnal mind is enmity again&s;t God; for it is not &s;ubject to the law of God, neither, indeed, can be. So then they that are in the fle&s;h cannot plea&s;e God,</HI> Rom. v. 6. and viii. 7, 8. And that God will puni&s;h the finally di&s;obedient, is as true as the former: <HI>For as many as have &s;inned in the law, &s;hall be jud|ged by the law.</HI> God will certainly revenge all di&s;o|bedience,&mdash;<HI>And the wrath of God will come on the children of di&s;obedience.</HI> Rom. ii. 10. 2 Cor. x. 6. Col. iii. 6, And that God is ju&s;t in puni&s;hing the finally di&s;obedient, is al&s;o true; for, <HI>Shall not the judge of the whole earth do right?</HI> Yea, <HI>He &s;hall judge the world with (or in) righteou&s;ne&s;s, and the people with his truth. Is God unrighteous who taketh
<PB N="11" REF="007860_0010_102DE946299917F8">
vengeance?&mdash;God forbid, for then how &s;hould God judge the world?</HI> Gen. xviii. 25. P&s;al. xcvi. 13. Acts xvii. 31. Rom. iii. 5, 6.</P>
<P>But then we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the puni&s;hment which will be inflicted on the finally di&s;obedient on the judgment day, will not be for unavoidable faults; they will not be condemned for not doing what they could not do; but for not doing the good they might have done, and for wilful &s;ins committed. Tho&s;e we have an account of in St. <HI>Matt.</HI> xxv. 41, to 46. that were &s;ent away <HI>into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment,</HI> it was for not doing the good they might have done; for they could have vi&s;ited the &s;ick and relieved them, but they would not. For though the moral liberty of the will be lo&s;t, the natural liberty remains; per&s;ons have power to read the word of God, to &s;peak the truth, at|tend divine wor&s;hip, give alms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And where the go&s;pel is preached, man has power, and ability to be|lieve, or give his a&s;&s;ent to it; and unbelief is the con|demning &s;in. <HI>He that believeth not, is condemned al|ready, becau&s;e he hath not believed in the name of the only begotton Son of God. And this is the condem|nation, that light is come into the world, and men love darkne&s;s rather than light, becau&s;e their deeds were evil,</HI> Joh. iii. 18, 19.</P>
<P>But then, per&s;ons will not be condemned for not be|lieving in Chri&s;t in a right go&s;pel-manner, or for being de&s;titute of true faith, <HI>the faith of God's elect;</HI> but for not believing in &s;uch a way and manner, and &s;o far as they might, according to the revelation made unto them; their faith will be found to come &s;hort, far &s;hort of what it might have attained unto; had they been dili|gent in reading and &s;earching the word of God, and not have pinn'd that &s;mall degree of hi&s;torical faith which
<PB N="12" REF="007860_0011_102DE9483B3BB240">
they had, on other men's &s;leeeves; and &s;o indulging them|&s;elves in idlene&s;s, giving more credit to men than to the Lord, and what he hath told them in his holy word. Man hath power to reform from open vice, to be moral|ly &s;ober and ju&s;t, and to do many things morally good, which he doth not; and, upon this footing, con&s;cience it&s;elf will condemn, and very ju&s;tly too. But as to true evangelical faith in the Son of God, called <HI>precious faith,</HI> and <HI>the faith of God's elect,</HI> 2 Pet. i. 1. Tit. i. 2. being given to them, and not to others; this is what none have by nature, nor can it be acquired, (though <HI>it comes by hearing</HI>) neither can any man have this faith except God give it unto him, <HI>Eph.</HI> ii. 8. <HI>Phil.</HI> i. 29. Neither will any per&s;on be condemned for the want of &s;uch a faith; 'tis unrea&s;onable and un|ju&s;t to think, or affirm this: there will be enough as matter of condemnation without this, as the wilful o|mi&s;&s;ion of known duties, and wilful commi&s;&s;ion of known &s;ins, oppo&s;ition to Chri&s;t and his go&s;pel; for he that knowneth his Lord's will, and doth it not, will be very ju&s;tly puni&s;hed; for <HI>when the Lord &s;hall be re|vealed from heaven, with his mighty angels, in flam|ing fire;</HI> (it will be) <HI>to take vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the go&s;pel of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> (&s;o far as they might have obeyed it) <HI>&s;uch &s;hall be puni&s;hed with everla&s;ting de&s;truction from the pre&s;ence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power,</HI> 2 The&s;. i. 7, 8, 9.</P>
<P>Furthermore, Though it would be unju&s;t to puni&s;h a creature fallen from a &s;tate of innocency, if the creature had not been endowed with &s;ufficient power to have &s;tood in that &s;tate of innocency, and to have kept the law it was placed under; yet, we may very well ju&s;tify the equity of God's proceeding again&s;t
<PB N="13" REF="007860_0012_102DE94AD38E39C0">
fallen man, in puni&s;hing him for his di&s;obedience to the law, though he has not power to keep it perfectly in his fallen &s;tate. For, as perfect obedience is God's right and due from the creature, &s;o it mu&s;t be the crea|ture's duty to give it; for though man has lo&s;t the power to obey, and is become unable to give God his ju&s;t due, God has not lo&s;t his right and authority over the creature, to command and require it.</P>
<P>The fallen angels have lo&s;t the power which once they had to love and obey God; yet, no per&s;on, I pre|&s;ume, will affirm, that God has not authority to com|mand them, or that it is not their duty to love and &s;erve him. If the power of the creature (man) was the mea|&s;ure of the creature's obedience, and God required no more of man than he in his fallen &s;tate can, or is able to give, then the creature's works would not be great, and God's demands mu&s;t be but &s;mall.</P>
<P>We &s;hould con&s;ider, that all mankind were included in <HI>Adam</HI> as their public head and repre&s;entative, and fell in him, and his lo&s;s was their lo&s;s. But, perhaps, &s;ome may &s;ay, what is it to me what <HI>Adam</HI> did? I never knew him, nor gave my con&s;ent to what he did; therefore, what concern have I with <HI>Adam?</HI> To which I an&s;wer; every one that knows him&s;elf, has &s;ome knowledge of his father <HI>Adam,</HI> and &s;en&s;ibly (to his grief and &s;orrow) feels what concern he had in his fir&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and con&s;equently in his tran&s;actions in the garden, antece|dent to his &s;inning.</P>
<P>I might a&s;k the&s;e per&s;ons in like manner, what it is to you what Chri&s;t did, the &s;econd <HI>Adam?</HI> you never knew him, nor gave your con&s;ent to what he did; therefore, what concern have you with him? For, if it be a ju&s;t and conclu&s;ive way of arguing, to exclude our&s;elves from having any concern in what <HI>Adam</HI> did, becau&s;e
<PB N="14" REF="007860_0013_102DE94D1553A010">
we never knew him in per&s;on, or gave our explicit con|&s;ent to what he did; why &s;hould not the argument be as ju&s;t and conclu&s;ive when applied to Chri&s;t the &s;econd <HI>Adam,</HI> whom we never knew per&s;onally, nor gave our con&s;ent to what he did? And it is a que&s;tion whe|ther tho&s;e who deny the head&s;hip of the fir&s;t <HI>Adam,</HI> believe, or care much about, the head&s;hip of the &s;e|cond.</P>
<P>Denying the head&s;hip of the fir&s;t <HI>Adam,</HI> is the way (in my humble opinion) to bring us into greater diffi|culties in accounting for, and clearing the ju&s;tice of God in his proceedings towards mankind, than owning it. For, do not all mankind &s;uffer upon the account of the fir&s;t &s;in, &s;ickne&s;s pain and death? Now, I a&s;k, where doth the ju&s;tice of God appear, in inflicting the&s;e things on mankind, if they are innocent? the&s;e things come upon many, before they have committed actual &s;in; for how much do infants, many times undergo, and &s;uffer? and where is the ju&s;tice of all this, if they are innocent? it cannot be for their own actual &s;ins, for they have none; if it is not for the &s;in of another, then it is for no &s;in at all; and whether it is unju&s;t or not to puni&s;h an innocent creature, let any man judge. What a contradiction is it, and how &s;hocking doth it appear, to &s;ee thou&s;ands of poor creatures brought in|to the world, under tho&s;e deplorable circum&s;tances, with the marks of God's anger upon them, and yet in|nocent? &s;trange! <HI>Far be it from the righteous God, that loveth righteou&s;ne&s;s, to puni&s;h the innocent as he doth the guilty!</HI></P>
<P>Again, I a&s;k, is not the cur&s;e which was inflicted on our fir&s;t parents for their fir&s;t &s;in, what their po&s;terity &s;hare in al&s;o? <HI>Gen.</HI> iii. 16, 17, 18, 19. <HI>And unto the woman he &s;aid, I will greatly multiply thy &s;orrow,
<PB N="15" REF="007860_0014_102DE94EC4EE38E8">

Ob&s;erve, the earth was cur&s;ed for <HI>Adam's &s;ake,</HI> it was cur&s;ed for his fir&s;t &s;in; and doth not the earth &s;till bring forth thorns and thi&s;tles? the&s;e things were not only a trouble to <HI>Adam,</HI> but they are &s;o to his children al&s;o. <HI>In &s;orrow &s;halt thou eat of it all the days of thy life,&mdash;in the &s;weat of thy face thou &s;halt eat bread&mdash;till thou return unto the ground,</HI> &amp;c.

Now, where is the ju&s;tice of inflicting all the&s;e evils upon mankind, on account of <HI>Adam</HI>'s fir&s;t &s;in, if that &s;in is not imputed unto them? And all tho&s;e moral evils that affect the &s;oul, <HI>(viz.)</HI> ignorance and dakrne&s;s of mind, impoten|cy and weakne&s;s in &s;piritual things, an aver&s;ion to good, a pronene&s;s to evil, <HI>&amp;c,</HI> are likewi&s;e the fruits and con&s;equences of the fir&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; <HI>Adam</HI>'s &s;trength was our &s;trength till he lo&s;t it.</P>
<P>The death &s;poken of in <HI>Rom.</HI> v. 17. as the con&s;e|quence of the fir&s;t &s;in, is &s;et in oppo&s;ition to eternal life. <HI>Death</HI> (is &s;aid) <HI>to reign by one man's offence.</HI> i e. <HI>A|dam</HI>'s fir&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. For, as the life &s;poken of in the other part of the ver&s;e, is a life of glory in heaven, <HI>Reigning in life by one Chri&s;t Je&s;us;</HI> the antithe&s;is re|quires death &s;hould intend a &s;piritual and eternal one.</P>
<P>But to conclude this head, from what has been &s;aid,
<PB N="16" REF="007860_0015_102DE950DAB78210">
we may &s;ee, that tho&s;e who deny the head&s;hip of Chri&s;t, are unavoidably led into the &s;ame error, they fix on tho&s;e that own it, <HI>(viz.)</HI> charging God with in|ju&s;tice. If any will &s;ay, it is unju&s;t to puni&s;h one man for another man's &s;in, <HI>viz.</HI> all mankind for the &s;ake of <HI>Adam</HI>'s &s;in, and think likewi&s;e that it is not right in God to puni&s;h man for his di&s;obedience to his holy law, becau&s;e man has lo&s;t the power he once had; let &s;uch per&s;ons con&s;ider, that though it would have been unju&s;t to have puni&s;hed man for his apo&s;tacy, in ca&s;e he had not been endowed with &s;ufficient power to have kept the law he was under; yet the ca&s;e is different with re&s;pect to fallen man: for though man in his pre|&s;ent fallen &s;tate has not power to keep the law of God, yet he has ability to do more moral good than he doth, and to ab&s;tain from many moral evils which he doth not; and therefore, upon his own account, may be very ju&s;tly puni&s;hed for his di&s;obedience to the law, and his oppo&s;ition to the go&s;pel. And al&s;o the ju&s;tice of God is evident in puni&s;hing mankind with natural and moral evils upon <HI>Adam</HI>'s account; as they were con|&s;idered in him as their head and repre&s;entative; and the ju&s;tice of God &s;hines forth with brighter rays in this &s;cheme than in the other. For, if <HI>Adam</HI>'s &s;in is not imputed to us, then all we &s;uffer before we commit actual &s;in, we undergo and &s;uffer as innocent. But ac|knowledging the head&s;hip of <HI>Adam,</HI> the ju&s;tice of God is cleared with reference to all we &s;uffer, as the con|&s;equence of the fir&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion: we being included in him, and as a part of him, it is but ju&s;t and rea&s;ona|ble we &s;hould &s;hare the &s;ame fate he did; and as to ju&s;tice and equity of this con&s;titution, none can doubt, that con&s;iders it was the righteous God that had the &s;ettling and ordering of the whole affair.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>Of the Fall of Man as a voluntary Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and of him&s;elf, being his own fault; and of the Liberty of Man's Will, and the Decrees of God being con&s;i&s;tent.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE fall of man was of him&s;elf; it was a wilful tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, that might have been avoided; that <HI>Adam</HI> fell therefore was intirely his own fault; he was <HI>made upright,</HI> but he turned a&s;ide. <HI>Man being in honour did not abide long;</HI> how long is uncertain: it was long enough to know what he enjoyed, that when he fell he was &s;en&s;ible what he had lo&s;t. Some men have affirmed, that God ordained the fall of man; but others have denied it, and find fault with &s;uch an a&s;&s;er|tion as being too har&s;h, and as making God the imme|diate cau&s;e of the fall, and author of &s;in.</P>
<P>But though to &s;ay God ordained the fall of man, may &s;ound har&s;h in the ears of &s;uch as perhaps under|&s;tand but little about the decrees of God, and the way and manner in which they are executed; yet I a&s;k where lies the evil, or har&s;hne&s;s of this propo&s;ition, (God ordained the fall?) &s;ome per&s;ons may be &s;o ignorant as to think, that what God ordains &s;hall be, he is the agent to effect, and the immediate cau&s;e thereof; but it is not always &s;o, for wicked men, when they are doing their own work, and the will and work of the devil; they are at the &s;ame time fulfilling the righteous de|crees of God. This is undeniable in the <HI>Jews</HI> put|ting to death our ble&s;&s;ed Lord. None will affirm that
<PB N="18" REF="007860_0017_102DE956476DB7D8">
God was the immediate cau&s;e of perpetrating that wick|ed act; it would be bla&s;phemy &s;o to &s;ay: and yet none can deny (who believes the word of God) that the death of Chri&s;t was fore-ordained of God; for thus it is written,&mdash;<HI>Him being delivered by the determinate coun&s;el and fore-knowledge of God, ye have crucified and &s;lain&mdash;For of a truth again&s;t thy holy child</HI> Je&s;us, <HI>whom thou ha&s;t anointed, both</HI> Herod, <HI>and</HI> Pontius Pilate, <HI>with the</HI> Gentiles, <HI>and the people of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>were gathered together, for to do what&s;oever thy hand and thy coun&s;el, determined (before) to be done,</HI> Acts ii. 23. iv. 27, 28.</P>
<P>I might a&s;k, is there any thing cometh to pa&s;s with|out God's ordination? If &s;o, then it mu&s;t be what he hath no concern with; for what&s;oever God doth either immediately by him&s;elf alone, or mediately, <HI>i. e.</HI> what he permits to be done by means and in&s;truments, is what he fir&s;t purpo&s;es shall be done. For, what&s;oever God permits to be, he fir&s;t ordains &s;hall be, having or|dained, he permits; if it were not &s;o, it would follow, that God permits &s;ome things to be, which he never purpo&s;ed or ordained &s;hould be, which mu&s;t be fal&s;e and ab&s;urd. Be&s;ides, it &s;hould be ob&s;erved, that as permi&s;&s;ion includes the ways, means, and in&s;truments, which effect and bring to pa&s;s what is permitted, the&s;e can't exi&s;t, much le&s;s operate and move, without the will and plea&s;ure of God they &s;hould. If any per&s;on &s;hould a&s;k, where then is the difference between God's ordaining and permitting? I an&s;wer, the difference is not &s;o great perhaps as &s;ome may imagine; the word <HI>permit,</HI> or <HI>permi&s;&s;ion,</HI> is proper enough; but as it &s;tands in &s;uch near connection with the word <HI>ordain,</HI> we mu&s;t take care not to admit wrong ideas.</P>
<P>That <HI>permi&s;&s;ion</HI> conveys a different idea from the
<PB N="19" REF="007860_0018_102DE957F242E9B0">
word <HI>ordain,</HI> is evident. For, the word <HI>permit,</HI> or per|mi&s;&s;ion, refers to the execution of God's decrees, and what he is not the immediate cau&s;e of; for what he has decreed to be done, that is, effected by him&s;elf, without means and in&s;truments, cannot come under the notion of permi&s;&s;ion; but when he accompli&s;heth his decrees by means and in&s;truments, he is &s;aid to permit; he permits it to be done.</P>
<P>Thus it may be truly &s;aid, God permitted the death of <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> for, every circum&s;tance relating thereunto was permitted; he permitted <HI>Pilate</HI> to condemn him, and the <HI>Jews</HI> to crucify him: but this doth not &s;up|po&s;e the death of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was not fore-ordained, but ra|ther implies it was. Permi&s;&s;ion &s;eems to me to include in it a purpo&s;e of mind to permit. When Agrippa <HI>&s;aid unto</HI> Paul <HI>thou art permitted to &s;peak for thy&s;elf,</HI> Acts xxvi. 1. mu&s;t we not &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>Agrippa</HI> fir&s;t came to a determination in his own mind, that <HI>Paul</HI> &s;hould have liberty to &s;peak and make his defence; and having de|termined, he permits? We &s;hould con&s;ider God may or|dain a thing to be done, and not be a doer of it him|&s;elf; but it is effected by means and in&s;truments as they fall out in their common way of working.</P>
<P>And though God is not the auther of &s;in, neither doth he approve it as a thing agreeable to his nature; yet we mu&s;t grant (except we deny the univer&s;al pro|vidence of God) that all means and &s;econd cau&s;es are under his direction, and that the whole cour&s;e of nature moves on in a direct line, as it was at fir&s;t fix'd, accord|ing to the original laws of nature; or, as it was the good will and plea&s;ure of God it &s;hould; and his will is the &s;ame as at the beginning: otherwi&s;e he could alter the cour&s;e of nature, or put a &s;top to the whole in a moment. And one would think, if the purpo&s;e,
<PB N="20" REF="007860_0019_102DE95A0C69BC00">
or decree of God may (as we know it may) be ex|tended to the crucifying of the &s;on of God; &s;o un|ju&s;t, barbarous, inhuman, and bloody an act <HI>(for by wicked hands he was crucified and &s;lain;)</HI> I &s;ay, if it be granted (and who dares deny it?) that his was fore-ordained by God, &s;urely there can be no danger in extending his decrees to any thing el&s;e. For, nothing can be &s;o horribly impious as the crucifying of the only begotten &s;on of God, <HI>the prince of life &s;lain and hanged on a tree!</HI> And yet, <HI>all that</HI> Herod, Pilate, <HI>the</HI> Gentiles, <HI>and the</HI> Jews <HI>did, was what the hand and coun&s;el of God had before determined &s;hould be done,</HI> Acts iv. 27, 28.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t al&s;o con&s;ider, that the decrees of God, in the Execution of them, no ways infringe the liberty of the creature's will: this is evident in the ca&s;e of <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s being &s;old (by his brethren) into <HI>Egypt;</HI> his brethren acted as free agents; it was a wicked act in them, proceeding from hatred and envy; and yet it was what God had appointed, or determined &s;hould be, in order to bring about and accompli&s;h many and great things, both in providence and grace. <HI>God &s;ent me</HI> (<HI>&s;aith</HI> Jo&s;eph) <HI>before you to pre&s;erve life&amp;And God &s;ent me before you to pre&s;erve a po&s;terity in the earth, and to &s;ave your lives by a great deliverance. So now, it was not you that &s;ent me hither, but God,</HI> Gen. xlv. 5, 7, 8.</P>
<P>This thing is no le&s;s evident, in the revolt of the ten tribes, which was a voluntary tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion in them; and yet, when <HI>Rehoboam</HI> was going to fight again&s;t <HI>I&s;rael, That he might bring the Kingdom again to</HI> Re|hoboam, <HI>the Lord forbid him, and &s;ent</HI> Shemaiah, <HI>the man of God, &s;aying, thus &s;aith the Lord, ye &s;hall not go up, to fight again&s;t your brethren, return every
<PB N="21" REF="007860_0020_102DE95CA327DCD8">
man to his hou&s;e, for this thing is done of me,</HI> 2 Chron. xi. 1, 2, 3, 4.</P>
<P>The &s;ame thing is equally plain in the death of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> And the&s;e are but a few of the many in&s;tances which might be produced out of the word of God, proving the&s;e two things. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> that what God per|mits, he fir&s;t ordains. <HI>Secondly,</HI> that neither the de|crees of God, nor the execution of them, infringe the liberty of man's will.</P>
<P>Sometimes God him&s;elf is the immediate agent to effect his own purpo&s;es, and in the execution of them makes u&s;e of no means or in&s;truments, as in the crea|tion of the world, the re&s;urrection of the dead, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And whenever his purpo&s;es are executed by good and lawful means, he is the chief cau&s;e, though in&s;truments be imployed; but, when the purpo&s;es of God are exe|cuted by means which in them&s;elves are not good, God is not the chief cau&s;e; he permits it &s;o to be.</P>
<P>And things which are in them&s;elves &s;inful, are per|mitted to be done; the doing of which is an accompli&s;h|ment of God's decrees, as the in&s;tances before named manife&s;t; (viz) the &s;elling <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> into <HI>Egypt;</HI> the revolt of the ten tribes; and the crucifying of <HI>Chri&s;t:</HI> all which were in them&s;elves &s;inful; and yet the doing of them was the executing, or fulfilling of God's eter|nal coun&s;el, particularly the crucifying of <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> which was not only the accompli&s;hment of God's eter|nal coun&s;el, concerning the death of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in particu|lar, but led on towards the effecting all tho&s;e things which God had purpo&s;ed concerning the &s;alvation of his cho&s;en people; looking backward or forward, all center in the death of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>That God foreknew from eternity, all creatures and actions, even the mo&s;t contingent, will, I pre&s;ume, be
<PB N="22" REF="007860_0021_102DE95EE2AD6160">
granted by all that believe divine revelation. And from the foreknowledge of God may be argued the certain future exi&s;tence of what&s;oever was foreknown. For what&s;oever is foreknown by God, or viewed as exi&s;ting, which yet is future, mu&s;t exi&s;t in time, according as it was foreknown, or viewed before time; or, the fore|knowledge of God would not be certain: for as nothing can exi&s;t that is future, without being fir&s;t viewed, or foreknown by God, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily exi&s;t in time; or God would be liable to be deceived, and which mu&s;t be the ca&s;e, if any thing was foreknown by God as what would be in time, and yet did not exi&s;t.</P>
<P>But this nece&s;&s;ity of exi&s;tence, puts nothing into the creature, when it exi&s;teth; it is not thereby impelled, or forced to act in the manner it doth: neither doth the foreknowledge of God alter the nature of any creature or action, whether good or bad; but con&s;iders things barely in the mode and manner in which they exi&s;t in time: and what&s;oever is foreknown by God as what would exi&s;t in a certain way, 'tis his will and plea&s;ure to permit it &s;o to exi&s;t; and this permi&s;&s;ion mu&s;t include in it, a purpo&s;e to permit. For what God foreknows before time, that comes to pa&s;s in time; he either determines within him&s;elf to permit the &s;ame to come pa&s;s, or he doth not; if the latter, <HI>(viz)</HI> if he doth not determine to permit it to come to pa&s;s, then his foreknowledge and his decrees are at odds; but if the former, <HI>i. e.</HI> if he did determine to permit, then it will follow, that permi&s;&s;ion includes in it, or &s;tands in clo&s;e connection with, a purpo&s;e as antecedent to permi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>As every thing, <HI>i.e.</HI> very creature, circum&s;tance, and action, which exi&s;t in time, were before time taken up in the great Jehovah's all-comprehending mind; and as nothing of all that was foreknown could
<PB N="23" REF="007860_0022_102DE9608D561000">
take place, without his will and plea&s;ure it &s;hould; therefore, to &s;uppose any thing falls out contrary to his intention, or what was his &s;ecret will &s;hould not be, is to deny his omnipotency; although at the &s;ame time it may be prohibited in his revealed will; which is no contradiction: for when God wills to permit things that are in them&s;elves &s;inful, it is not as approving of them con&s;idered in their nature as &s;inful, for God doth not ab&s;olutely will evil con&s;idered in it&s;elf as a thing repugnant to his holy nature; but he wills it with re|ference to other views and ends; &s;o that what God prohibits in his revealed will, as things contrary to his holy and pure nature, he in his &s;ecret will determines to permit for wi&s;e and good ends, which he can, and will, accompli&s;h thereby.</P>
<P>Thus with re&s;pect to the &s;in and fall of man, and the crucifying of <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> things that are &s;inful, and forbidden in God's revealed will, being contrary to his holy nature, and what he could not approve of; yet we &s;ee it was his &s;ecret will the&s;e things &s;hould &s;o come to pa&s;s; and had &s;o purpo&s;ed within him&s;elf before the foundation of the world; and that his ends and views in all this were wi&s;e and good, none can que&s;tion that under&s;tands and believes what he reads in the word of God. Therefore to &s;ay it was the will and plea&s;ure of God to permit <HI>Adam</HI> to fall, and that it is his will and plea&s;ure to permit (or &s;uffer, which is the &s;ame) what&s;o|ever falls out and comes to pa&s;s in the world, is ex|pre&s;&s;ing fully my meaning, and what I intend.</P>
<P>Therefore, if any man like not this way of expre&s;&s;i|on, (viz.) <HI>God ordained the fall,</HI> he may have it in the following terms, (viz.) <HI>It was the good will and plea|&s;ure of God to permit</HI> Adam <HI>to fall.</HI>&mdash;And which is the &s;ofte&s;t and be&s;t way of expre&s;&s;ion; but then it mu&s;t be
<PB N="24" REF="007860_0023_102DE962362B4F40">
ob&s;erved, that the good will and plea&s;ure of God can|not be &s;eparated from his eternal purpo&s;e, but is the very &s;ame thing in other words, as may be &s;een in <HI>Eph.</HI> i. 5, 9.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee God permitted man to &s;in and fall; he &s;uffered the Devil to tempt him, to &s;educe and over|come him. But the &s;in and fall of <HI>Adam,</HI> and the wickedne&s;s committed in the world &s;ince, mu&s;t be con|&s;idered with this difference; namely, there is in fallen man a deficiency, a want of &s;trength to &s;tand again&s;t Satan and his temptations, which was not the ca&s;e with reference to <HI>Adam;</HI> he had power to re&s;i&s;t and over|come the temptation: God permitted innocent man to fall into &s;in, and he permits &s;inful man to go on in &s;in.</P>
<P>It was not a precarious thing with God whether <HI>Adam</HI> would &s;tand or fall; as is evident from the early provi&s;ion he made for man's recovery, laying the plan of man's &s;alvation in the death of his own Son. This &s;cheme of man's redemption from &s;in, &s;uppo&s;ed his falling into it; and the model of this was drawn, and the whole affair &s;ettled before man was made. <HI>The Mediator was &s;et up from everla&s;ting&mdash;and a people cho&s;en in him before the foundation of the world; and grace trea&s;ured up in the Mediator's hand for all the elect, before the world began,</HI> Prov. viii. 22, to 32. Eph. 1. 4. 2 Tim. 1. 9.</P>
<P>From what has been &s;aid, I hope it is evident, that the fall of man was from him&s;elf; it was a wilful tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion; he could not ju&s;tly blame any but him&s;elf. And yet, previous to this, we may &s;ay, it was the good will and plea&s;ure of God to permit or &s;uffer it &s;o to be; but this no ways affected the will of <HI>Adam,</HI> no not in the lea&s;t, &s;o as to lay any nece&s;&s;ity upon it; neither doth it ever affect the will of any creature in this &s;en&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. <HI>Contains an an&s;wer to the following query, (viz.)</HI> Whether any mere creature will &s;tand in the &s;tate in which it is created, upon the foot of creation-powers and abilities, without &s;upernatural aids, or confirm|ing grace?</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ubject of this chapter will be to enquire in|to the nature of all created beings, and con&s;e|quently that of man in the &s;tate of innocence.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion before us is not, <HI>whether an innocent creature can &s;tand, but whether it will?</HI> I &s;hall take the liberty to &s;earch into this query, not to &s;atisfy cu|rio&s;ity, but to find out, as far as I can, the truth; it will help us to &s;ee the nature of all created beings; and if we find the an&s;wer in the negative; if it be no more than &s;trongly probable, that no creature will &s;tand upon the foot of creation-abilities, then it will lead our thoughts to the &s;pecial love of God, &s;ecuring, by a righ|teous and gracious decree, the happine&s;s of elect men and angels. The &s;tate of the que&s;tion, is (not whether an innocent creature can &s;tand, for that is out of all que&s;tion, but) whether any mere creature <HI>will &s;tand,</HI> in that &s;tate in which it is created, upon the foot of cre|tion-powers and abilities, without &s;upernatural aids, or confirming grace? I &s;hall lay it down for a truth that none will, or, that 'tis at lea&s;t exceeding probable, that no mere creature will &s;tand and per&s;evere long, without being confirmed by the &s;pecial grace of God. For the proof of this, I &s;hall produce the following argu|ments.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="007860_0025_102DE967B5099F18">I. <HI>The fir&s;t argument &s;hall be taken from matter of fact; the fall of man and angels.</HI> The&s;e we know did not &s;tand in the &s;tate in which they were made; they had power to &s;tand, but did not: as to tho&s;e an|gels which did not fall, their &s;tanding is not owing to creation-powers and abilities, but electing grace: they are called <HI>the elect angels,</HI> I <HI>Tim.</HI> v. 21.</P>
<P>Perhaps &s;ome men may think, they were elected after they had given &s;ufficient proof of their fidelity, and had the re&s;t done the &s;ame, they would al&s;o have been elected. To which I an&s;wer, this is not &s;o much as probable, for <HI>two</HI> rea&s;ons; for, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> this would make election according to works, which would have given room for boa&s;ting, and is contrary to God's pro|ceedings in other ca&s;es, namely, the election of men, <HI>Rom.</HI> xi. 5. which is, <HI>according to grace. Secondly,</HI> then they mu&s;t have &s;tood the time of their trial, which 'tis evident they had not; for, as we mu&s;t conclude, the angels were all created at once, were all of one &s;pecies or nature, &s;o the time of their probation mu&s;t be the &s;ame; and tho&s;e that fell had not &s;tood the full time of their trial, for then they would not have fallen: but they fell &s;hort of the limits &s;et them, that is, of per&s;evering to the end.

vii. 6, 7. <HI>Rom.</HI> xi. 5. We may therefore conclude, that had it not been for electing grace, the now holy and happy angels had fell as their fellows did; and I make no que&s;tion but they know this, and are deeply affected with it; angels as well as men will ble&s;s God for electing grace! Perhaps it may be &s;aid, that man, if he had not had a tempter, might have &s;tood. I an&s;wer, it cannot be proved that he would have &s;tood, &s;uppo&s;ing he had no external temper; the contrary is much more probable, as the angels (except the elect) did fall, who had not (at lea&s;t, not all of them) any external temper, and what angels did, man might have done. However, as angels and man did not &s;tand, and we know not that God hath made any other order, or rank of rational and intellectual beings which have &s;tood upon the foot of creation-powers and abilities, the conclu&s;ion from hence, that no creature will &s;tand mu&s;t carry in it at lea&s;t a &s;trong probability.</P>
<P>II. <HI>The &s;econd argument is taken from the nece&s;|&s;ary dependance of the creature on the Creator, for the continuation of it's happine&s;s, and the liablene&s;s there is of the creature's getting off from that dependance, and &s;o lo&s;ing its happine&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>As all creatures mu&s;t be dependant on their creator, for the whole of their happine&s;s, both as to the thing it&s;elf, and the continuance of it; there may be, for a|ny thing I can &s;ee, a very great liablene&s;s of getting off from their dependance; the con&s;equence of which mu&s;t be the lo&s;s of their happine&s;s. In which ca&s;e there is nothing withheld (by God) from the creature, but 'tis the creature withdraws and gets off from its creator, the con&s;equence of which mu&s;t be apo&s;tacy. This was <HI>A|dam</HI>'s ca&s;e, &s;o long as his dependance was firm he

For as the woman was tempted by the Devil in the &s;erpent; &s;o <HI>A|dam</HI> was tempted by the Devil in the woman; or, at lea&s;t, by his making u&s;e of the woman, <HI>Gen.</HI> iii. 17.</NOTE> got here, was of the greate&s;t prejudice to <HI>Adam;</HI> his dependance upon God being gradually wea|kened, till he gave more heed to what the tempter &s;aid, than to what God &s;aid, and this was the fatal blow; no &s;ooner had Satan gained this point, but his work was done.</P>
<P>Had <HI>Adam</HI> been upon his guard in the exerci&s;e of tho&s;e powers he was endowed with, and cleaved fa&s;t to God's word, the enemy had not prevailed.</P>
<P>Now, what <HI>Adam</HI> did, another creature might do, and angels did. Therefore, as all creatures mu&s;t be dependent upon their creator for their happine&s;s, and their continuance of it; and can &s;tand and enjoy it no longer than they cleave fa&s;t to God and his holy word; I &s;ee not why a mere creature may not be exceeding liable to fall; and it is at lea&s;t very probable, a crea|ture without &s;upernatural aids will fall.</P>
<P>III. <HI>The third argument &s;hall be drawn from the nature of all created e&s;&s;ences, and mere creature-abili|ties, as being liable to change.</HI></P>
<P>No being is, or can be, by creation, unchangeable; no created e&s;&s;ence hath this property belonging to it,
<PB N="29" REF="007860_0028_102DE96F3382F360">
by virtue of its creation: God alone (who is an un|created e&s;&s;ence) is unchangeable. <HI>I am the Lord, I change not,</HI> Mal. iii. 6.</P>
<P>All creatures are mutable and liable to change, though they be the mo&s;t excellent; for, if you &s;uppo&s;e a creature of the highe&s;t rank, ble&s;t with created powers and abilities to the highe&s;t degree po&s;&s;ible, yet 'tis but a creature, and no more&punc; could we &s;uppo&s;e a mere creature unchangeable by nature, it would no longer be a crea|ture, but God. It is true, God can put a creature in|to a fix'd &s;tate, as the elect angels are and as &s;aints will be in heaven: but this will be owing to the &s;pecial grace of God confirming them in that ble&s;&s;ed &s;tate; and not to any natural powers and abilities in them&s;elves: 'tis an act of &s;overeign grace, and mu&s;t be re&s;olved in|to that glorious and irrever&s;ible decree which he hath pa&s;t, <HI>that &s;o it &s;hall be.</HI> Therefore from the nature of all created beings, ari&s;es a &s;trong pre&s;umption that no mere creature will &s;tand long upon the foot of crea|tion-abilities, without &s;uper-added &s;trength, or confirm|ing grace.</P>
<P>IV. <HI>The fourth argument &s;hall be grounded on the liablene&s;s there is in all created beings to err.</HI></P>
<P>It is a que&s;tion; whether any mere creature from its creation-powers and abilities can be exempted from a liablene&s;s to err, and that for two rea&s;ons, (1.) One rea&s;on of this is, the creature's knowledge mu&s;t be bounded; for that knowledge which is not infinite mu&s;t have bounds; but a creature's knowledge is not infinite, therefore has bounds. From hence ari&s;es a liablene&s;s to err, not knowing (always) certainly, what may be the event of &s;uch or &s;uch a cour&s;e if taken by the creature. A creature may be perfect in know|ledge,
<PB N="30" REF="007860_0029_102DE970DA05AAB8">
<HI>i. e.</HI> be as perfect in knowledge as the nature of the creature will admit of, but its knowledge cannot reach to all that is future. I do not &s;ay, a creature cannot be exempted from erring; for it is evident elect angels are, and the &s;aints will be in heaven; but this is not to be a&s;cribed to creature-abilities, but to the grace of God confirming them in that &s;tate where it is impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould err. God alone is <HI>the only wi&s;e,</HI>&mdash;infinite in knowledge; and one rea&s;on why God cannot err, is, becau&s;e he knows all things; what&s;oever is future, <HI>he &s;eeth from the beginning to the end;</HI> his knowledge hath no bounds.</P>
<P><HI>Adam</HI> was as knowing as &s;uch a creature could be; but 'tis a que&s;tion whether he certainly knew what would be the con&s;equence of eating the forbidden fruit: &s;uppo&s;e he knew that death would follow (which he might know from the threatning) did he know what death was? or was he capable of knowing to the full extent the evil and mi&s;ery would follow? or did he believe (when he took and eat) what was con|tained in the prohibition, <HI>Thou &s;halt &s;urely die?</HI> (May we not conclude, that not only <HI>Eve</HI>'s faith, but <HI>Adam</HI>'s al&s;o, was weakened, if not quite de&s;troyed, with refer|ence to God's word, and when credit was given to what the &s;erpent &s;aid, <HI>Ye &s;hall not &s;urely die.</HI> And it &s;hould be con&s;idered, whether &s;in be not always pur&s;ued under the notion of &s;ome good. In <HI>Gen.</HI> iii. 7 'tis &s;aid, after they had eat, <HI>the eyes of them both were opened,</HI> &amp;c. Not only the woman's eyes, but the man's al&s;o; there|fore <HI>Adam</HI>'s eyes were not opened before he eat the forbidden fruit: for what can be meant by the open|ing of the eyes, but &s;eeing and knowing what he did not before <HI>(viz.)</HI> to di&s;cern between good and evil; &s;eeing the difference, and experimentally feeling the
<PB N="31" REF="007860_0030_102DE97301438C20">
&s;ad con&s;equences of eating the forbidden fruit; <HI>They knew that they avere naked.</HI> Not only that their bo|dies wanted cloathing, but they knew that their &s;ouls were naked, &s;tript of tho&s;e excellencies which they had before, <HI>i. e. the image of God.</HI> Had <HI>Adam</HI> known certainly what would have followed upon eating&mdash;then it might be &s;aid his eyes were open before he eat; which is contrary to the expre&s;s words of the text&mdash;<HI>She took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave al&s;o unto her hu&s;band with her, and he did eat. And the eyes of them were opened, and they knew that they were na|ked &amp;c.</HI> Gen. iii. 6, 7.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee there is a liablene&s;s to err, ari&s;ing from the creature's knowledge being bounded.</P>
<P>II. This liablene&s;s to err, ari&s;eth al&s;o from innocent nature being capable of &s;eduction. Though there was nothing, in the innocent nature of man, nor angels, that naturally led on towards apo&s;tacy, yet that, that upright principle which was in innocent nature was liable to be corrupted, or, take a wrong and &s;inful bias, is evident, in that it did &s;o, both in man and angels: and when that innate principle, which is the governing principle in the &s;oul, is corrupted, then the creature can no longer &s;tand, but mu&s;t fall, nay is fallen. And may we not conclude, that this innate principle in man and angels included in it a very peculiar ta&s;te of true greatne&s;s and honour. This principle lay in the &s;oul, till the tempta|tion came which drew it out; but then there mu&s;t be &s;uch a principle in nature, or it could not have been drawn out. And is not this very apparent from this con&s;ideration, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that it was honour and preferment the devil made u&s;e of as the lure or bait; that which &s;eemed to prevail was this, <HI>Ye &s;hall be as Gods.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="007860_0031_102DE974AED39C20">'Tis true, this is what the Devil in the &s;erpent &s;aith to <HI>Eve;</HI> but then, as the woman was the Devil's in|&s;trument to tempt <HI>Adam,</HI> is it not very rea&s;onable to think that &s;he made u&s;e of the &s;ame way in tempting her husband as the &s;erpent had done in tempting of her? That &s;he u&s;ed &s;ome arguments with him is very plain from <HI>Gen.</HI> iii. 17. where <HI>Adam</HI> is charged by the Lord with <HI>hearkening to the voice of his wife.</HI> And 'tis ob&s;ervable, that the honour and preferment propo&s;ed by the &s;erpent, was under the colour of true greatne&s;s and honour; as there can be no greater honour than to be a God, <HI>Ye &s;hall be as Gods.</HI> Now had there been no &s;uch principle in innocent nature, it may be enquired, whether this temptation would have had any hold. And what further confirms this to me is, the account we have of the woman before &s;he eat, <HI>Gen.</HI> iii. 6. <HI>And when the woman &s;aw that the tree was good for food, and that it was plea&s;ant to the eyes, and a tree to be de&s;ired to make one wi&s;e, &s;he took,</HI> &amp;c.

Or, as it is in &s;ome ver&s;ions, <HI>A plea&s;ant tree to give under&s;tanding&mdash;or, a tree to be de&s;ired to get knowledge,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I do not &s;uppo&s;e this principle was corrupt, or &s;inful, but pure and holy, 'till it took a wrong bias, and was indulged beyond its proper bounds. And it is exceed|ing probable to me, that <HI>Satan</HI> knew there was &s;uch a principle in innocent man which might be drawn forth to a&s;pire after greatne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I do not &s;uppo&s;e but <HI>Adam</HI> was perfectly well &s;atis|fied in the &s;tate in which he was placed; he had no unea&s;y propen&s;ities, or longings after more knowledge: but what I &s;ay is, that it appears to me very plain, that there was &s;uch a principle in innocent nature, which
<PB N="33" REF="007860_0032_102DE977B0D436B0">
being touch'd, would immediately catch fire, if a &s;trict watch and guard were not kept over it. And the &s;parks of temptation being by the Devil ca&s;t upon this tender and delicate part of the &s;oul, pre&s;ently took fire; and thus man inwardly burned with re&s;tle&s;s and &s;inful de|&s;ires after forbidden knowledge: but this was after the temptation had taken hold of him, and that innate prin|ciple was corrupted, which before was a main part of the glory of human nature. And it is very rea&s;onable to think, that <HI>Satan</HI> knew, or at lea&s;t, might imagine there was &s;uch a principle in innocent man; as there was, I make no que&s;tion, &s;uch an innate principle in the angels, which they that fell abu&s;ed to their ruin: and they might very rea&s;onably conclude upon the &s;e|duction of man in the &s;ame way; accordingly the Devil tries the experiment, and finds his account in it.</P>
<P>That there was a likene&s;s between the fall of man and angels, is evident enough, in that pride was the cau&s;e of both; as may be &s;een in comparing, <HI>Gen.</HI> iii. 5. with 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> iii. 6. There is this difference, as &s;ome may think, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that <HI>Adam</HI> had a tempter, but the angels had none. That <HI>Adam</HI> had a Tempter is unde|niable, but that the fallen angels had none is not &s;o evi|dent. I do not &s;uppo&s;e they (at lea&s;t not all of them) had any other tempter, but as they might be their own tempters; &s;o that though they had no external tempter, as man had, they might have an internal one; or one, or a few might fall fir&s;t, and tempt and &s;educe the re&s;t; as <HI>Eve</HI> was fir&s;t &s;educed by the &s;erpent, and then the means of drawing the man into rebellion: &s;o one of the chief of tho&s;e &s;pirits might rebel fir&s;t, and then &s;e|duce the re&s;t, and &s;o the mo&s;t had a tempter, if not tempters: <HI>(viz.)</HI> Beelzebub <HI>the chief of the Devils,</HI> Luke xi. 15. Or po&s;&s;ibly they might be their own tempters, by rai&s;ing in their minds forbidden ideas,
<PB N="34" REF="007860_0033_102DE97A18C35718">
which being rai&s;ed, and indulged, became a &s;nare to them. And had not <HI>Adam</HI> indulged &s;omething of this kind, the external temptation had not hurt him, Be|tween the fall of man and angels, it may be thought, there is on man's &s;ide this favourable circum&s;tance <HI>(viz)</HI> the external temptation, this might be a means of ex|citing in him tho&s;e forbidden ideas: But if he had not had an external temptation, he might have erred as the angels did. Some per&s;ons may call this mere conjec|ture, things that are not revealed. To which I an&s;wer, the fall of man and angels is revealed, <HI>Gen.</HI> iii. <HI>John</HI> viii. 44. <HI>Jude</HI> 6. And I think it mu&s;t be lawful, and in &s;ome re&s;pects commendable, to draw from things re|vealed the mo&s;t evident and rational conclu&s;ions, guard|ed again&s;t po&s;itive a&s;&s;ertions: whether the&s;e conclu&s;i|ons I have drawn, and laid down, are the mo&s;t evident and rational, is left to &s;erious and pious con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>But to conclude this &s;ubject, <HI>Adam</HI> &s;tood as a pro|bationer, and there mu&s;t be &s;omething as the te&s;t of his obedience; this we are told was a tree bearing fruit &s;tanding in the mid&s;t of the garden, called, <HI>the tree of knowledge of good and evil,</HI> Gen. ii. 9, 17. Now there being &s;uch an innate principle in innocent nature, which on the fir&s;t notice, or hint, was liable to be drawn forth in a&s;piring after honour and preferment, or being more knowing and wi&s;e; this tree was a te&s;t of <HI>Adam</HI>'s obedience; prohibiting him from any new and curious enquiries after hidden things. And here it was <HI>Adam</HI> &s;hould have been perpetually upon his guard, and not have &s;uffered that innate principle to rebel, but kept within its pre&s;cribed limits. For the ultimate end of this innate principle was to glorify God, in &s;hewing man's ju&s;t &s;ubjection to his makers righteous commands. This was <HI>Adam</HI>'s paradi&s;e, this his bounds; and with|in
<PB N="35" REF="007860_0034_102DE97D09C81EB0">
the&s;e &s;acred limits he was to dwell; contemplating the perfections of his creator, and tho&s;e excellent en|dowments wherewith he him&s;elf was ble&s;t. As it mu&s;t afford a very peculiar joy, yea, give the mo&s;t refined and exalted plea&s;ures to innocent man, beholding him|&s;elf adorned with the bright image of his maker; and the pure&s;t joys mu&s;t &s;weetly flow into his &s;oul, when turning his eyes from him&s;elf to view the grand origin|al, the fountain from whence he had received his be|ing, and all the embeli&s;hments of nature: and this could not fail of producing in him the mo&s;t unfeign|ed thanks and gratitude to his great and liberal bene|factor. And here it was <HI>Adam</HI> &s;hould have re&s;ted him|&s;elf contented, in this delightful, clear, and a&s;&s;imilat|ing &s;ight of the great Jehovah. But, giving way of a&s;|piring thoughts, &s;eeking after a fal&s;e greatne&s;s was his ruin; &s;uffering that innate, and powerful principle, to take a wrong turn. If he had &s;ought after honour, it &s;hould have been in the exerci&s;e of the powers of nature, in &s;uch a way as was con&s;i&s;tent with his de|pendance upon, and rightful obedience to his great creator.</P>
<P>Had any thing been propo&s;ed by God as a motive to honour and preferment, may we not conclude that, that innate principle in innocent nature, would immediately have taken the hint, and been as quick and powerful in its operation in &s;eeking after true greatne&s;s. For, the preferment &s;ought after was under the colour of true greatne&s;s, <HI>Ye &s;hall be as gods.</HI> Had they cer|tainly known, that in&s;tead of being <HI>as Gods,</HI> they &s;hould be <HI>like Devils;</HI> is it &s;o much as probable they would have taken and eat? for as the woman, &s;o the man al&s;o affected Deity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr. GILL'S annot. on <HI>Phil.</HI> ii. 6.</NOTE>. And I think, of all expedients that
<PB N="36" REF="007860_0035_102DE97F908AC590">
could be found out, to turn man into a Devil, none more proper than to tempt him to a&s;pire to be a God.</P>
<P>And as it may be a que&s;tion, whether Satan could have prevailed (&s;o well) any other way; &s;o, it may be enquired, whether he could have done it this way, if the nature of man, in the &s;tate of innocency, had not been endowed with a very peculiar and delicate ta&s;te of true greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>But here lay the mi&s;chief, in mi&s;taking a fal&s;e great|ne&s;s for a true one; it was very unlikely, nay, im|po&s;&s;ible to obtain this end, in going contrary to the ex|pre&s;s word of God: and this they &s;oon &s;aw; and by &s;or|rowful experience found they were deceived, and in&s;tead of ri&s;ing to honour and prefrement, they &s;unk down into poverty, di&s;grace, and &s;hame. Now, from the liablene&s;s there is of this innate principle of rectitude in innocent nature being corrupted, ari&s;es a very great improbabili|ty of any meer creature's &s;tanding on the foot of cre|ation-powers and abilities, without &s;uper-added &s;trength, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In all that I have &s;aid in an&s;wer to this query <HI>(viz.)</HI> whether any meer creature will &s;tand the time allotted for trial, on the foot of creation-abilities&amp;without &s;u|per-added &s;trength, or confirming grace; I have not po&s;itively affirmed, none will &s;tand upon &s;uch a foot|ing, but that there is a very great probability none would, and to this opinion my mind &s;trongly inclines.</P>
<P>Since man did not &s;tand upon the foot of creation-abilities, nor the angels, and as we know not of any other creatures that God hath made that have &s;tood; for all created beings mu&s;t be dependant upon their creator for their happine&s;s, and are not exempted by their creation from a very great liability of getting off from their dependance, and &s;o lo&s;ing their happine&s;s;
<PB N="37" REF="007860_0036_102DE981B9485650">
and as all created e&s;&s;ences, and meer creature-abilities are liable to change, and the highe&s;t rank of creatures may err, as their knowledge mu&s;t be bounded, and in|nocent nature it&s;elf is capable of &s;eduction. But the creature's fall is from it&s;elf; both angels and man had &s;ufficient power to &s;tand: it was altogether man's fault; <HI>he was made upright, but they &s;ought out many inven|tions.</HI> That proved their ruin, and brought &s;in, and &s;orrow; and death upon them&s;elves and their po&s;terity.

<P>For, if man and angels (except the elect) lo&s;t their creation-happine&s;s; if when they were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of

The &s;alvation of any of the fallen race of <HI>Adam</HI> cannot certainly be concluded upon from the &s;uppo&s;ed free agency of man. If the whole, as to the event and final i&s;&s;ue, be left to turn upon the will of the creature; and if it be entirely in man's power to win or lo&s;e heaven; then what certainty can there be, that any will po&s;&s;e&s;s eternal life? The creature's will is changeable; and what the creature-abilities, and common a&s;&s;i&s;tances, when &s;et in oppo&s;ition to the diffi|culties and enemies that ob&s;truct and hinder per&s;ons in their &s;eeking after happine&s;s in a future &s;tate?

<P>O! what a ble&s;&s;ed foundation is here to re&s;t eternal life and happine&s;s upon! But on the foot of works, or the free will of the creature, all mu&s;t be at a great un|certainty: &s;uppo&s;e it was in the power of man, with that divine, or &s;uper-added a&s;&s;i&s;tance which is common to all where the go&s;pel comes, to ri&s;e up and &s;tand up|on his feet, yet even then how very unlikely is it that he &s;hould &s;tand, and per&s;evere long, if his &s;tanding de|pended upon him&s;elf, and what he could do? And was I to put it upon this foot <HI>(viz.)</HI> that man is pure by nature, and that Chri&s;t hath done enough for all men to an&s;wer the di&s;advantages they receive by the fall; even then it is very uncertain whether any would ob|tain eternal life; for if <HI>Adam</HI> lo&s;t his happine&s;s, why may not man, fallen man, lo&s;e his? Nay, were we to &s;uppo&s;e the pre&s;ent &s;tate of man every way as good as <HI>Adam</HI>'s was in innocency, even then al&s;o it would be uncertain, whether any would continue long in &s;uch a &s;tate: for why may not mankind fall as well as <HI>Adam?</HI> He lo&s;t his paradi&s;e, and 'tis at lea&s;t exceeding proba|ble, the children will tread in their fathers &s;teps, and lo&s;e their paradi&s;e too. I think none can imagine that mankind in their fallen &s;tate have any thing &s;uperior to what <HI>Adam</HI> had, or enjoyed in innocency; and we &s;ee that putting things upon a level, the happine&s;s of man mu&s;t be very uncertain, and precarious; for <HI>Adam</HI> lo&s;t his happine&s;s, (I mean his creation-happine&s;s) and we know that mankind may lo&s;e theirs, except man or his pre&s;ent &s;tate be better than <HI>Adam</HI>'s was. But the truth
<PB N="40" REF="007860_0039_102DE9879EFF39F8">
is, the pre&s;ent &s;tate of man is far wor&s;e than that before the fall; the powers of man are not only weak|ened, but man in his natural &s;tate is <HI>dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins;</HI> de&s;titute of &s;piritual &s;trength, aver&s;e to good, and prone to evil, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> An univer&s;al recovery, is no recovery at all; for it being conditional, the perfor|mance of the&s;e conditions, <HI>(viz.)</HI> faith, repentance, and &s;incere obedience, are out of the power of man; and if we &s;uppo&s;e them within the power of man, &s;till 'tis very uncertain whether they will be performed. But by God's taking this great and important affair in|to his own hand, the happine&s;s of man is thereby put upon &s;uch a foot as cannot mi&s;carry: and thus the hap|pine&s;s of true believers depends entirely on the &s;ove|reign free grace of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us: which was one main thing I had in view, in enquiring into the na|ture of all created beings; and which is &s;o noble a &s;ub|ject, &s;o full of the mo&s;t &s;olid peace, and la&s;ting joy, as cannot fail of rai&s;ing up our admiring thoughts, and fix|ing our delightful contemplations on the everla&s;ting love of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us! the &s;ource and fountain of all our happine&s;s. Thus we &s;ee the happine&s;s of fallen man is not certain, or cannot certainly be con|cluded on, upon any other foot, or foundation, than that of God's eternal purpo&s;e, &s;ecuring the &s;ame by covenant in his own dear Son.</P>
<P>And, which mu&s;t imply al&s;o, that eternal life and happine&s;s cannot be obtained by works, or any thing the creature can do. For, this &s;eems a clear con&s;e|quence, <HI>(viz.)</HI> If our happine&s;s be &s;ecured in the co|venant made with Chri&s;t (according to the conclu&s;ion above) then it cannot re&s;t upon works. For, as <HI>Adam</HI> when he had his creation-happine&s;s in his own hand, to keep or lo&s;e&punc; did not keep, but lo&s;e it; 'tis very unlike|ly
<PB N="41" REF="007860_0040_102DE989DEE89130">
that God &s;hould put it upon the &s;ame footing again, <HI>(viz.)</HI> works. <HI>Adam</HI>'s happine&s;s, as to the circum|&s;tances of it, was conditional; the covenant was, <HI>do this and live;</HI> or, if not, die.</P>
<P>But the happine&s;s we are to &s;eek after, as 'tis not in our keeping, nor are we in the actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it; &s;o neither is it promi&s;ed unto us on condition of any thing done by us in order to purcha&s;e it; but it is laid up in the free promi&s;e of God; and this promi&s;e (of eternal life) as all others are, is <HI>in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, yea and a|men, to the glory of God by us.</HI></P>
<P>A condition and a free promi&s;e are contrary one to the other, as may be &s;een in <HI>Gal.</HI> iii. 18. <HI>For if the inheritance be of the law</HI> (or works) <HI>it is no more of promi&s;e but God gave it to</HI> Abraham <HI>by promi&s;e.</HI> And that the promi&s;e of eternal life is a free promi&s;e, who can que&s;tion? For was it not an act of God's, &s;overeign good will and plea&s;ure to make &s;uch a promi&s;e to &s;inful creatures, who de&s;erve eternal wrath? And 'tis beneath God to promi&s;e eternal life (the greate&s;t thing he could promi&s;e) on &s;uch a mean condition as a poor imperfect obedience of the creature, thus to hang &s;o glorious a prize on &s;o mean a condition, and &s;o expo&s;e heaven to &s;ale. No, <HI>eternal life is the gift of God through Je|&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord. Not by works of righteou&s;ne&s;s which we</HI> (who are true believers) <HI>have done, but ac|cording to his mercy he &s;aved us, by the wa&s;hing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> 'Tis, <HI>they which receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;hall reign in life by one Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> Rom. vi. 23. Tit. iii. 5. Rom. v. 17.</P>
<P>Works and grace, law and promi&s;e, cannot agree to|gether; 'tis either by the one, or el&s;e by the other; they cannot be blended together: heaven is either the
<PB N="42" REF="007860_0041_102DE98C6915E608">
free gift of God, what he hath promi&s;ed to man for the &s;ake of what Chri&s;t hath done, without the con&s;idera|tion of any thing done by man as a condition to obtain it; or, 'tis promi&s;ed to man upon condition of doing what is enjoined him as a duty: if the former, then works are excluded; but if the latter, then grace is excluded. A thing cannot be &s;aid to be freely given, if it be given on conditions; if the per&s;on to whom it is given be tied up to the performance of &s;omething to be done, the doing of which work or &s;ervice being the condition of his en|joying what was promi&s;ed, cuts off the freene&s;s of the promi&s;e: 'tis not a free promi&s;e, but a conditional one. And this is what people in common under&s;tand; for if you offer to give a per&s;on any thing, and at the &s;ame time in&s;i&s;t upon his doing you a little piece of &s;ervice, he will plainly &s;ee, though it was in &s;ome re&s;pects a gift, yet in no re&s;pect a free gift. Therefore to make hea|ven a free gift, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to cut off all conditions. To &s;ay heaven is free gift, becau&s;e there is no pro|portion between what we do, and what we receive, is &s;ay|ing nothing to the purpo&s;e: for, if I promi&s;e a man double wages for his work when he hath done it the wages is due, and doing the work is what procures the reward: it becomes due when the work is done, and not before.</P>
<P>'Tis true, there mu&s;t be &s;omething wrought in, and done by tho&s;e that inherit eternal life; tho&s;e that enter into the kingdom of glory are &s;uch as are <HI>born of God,</HI> having true faith wrought in them, <HI>that faith which is of the operation of God; precious faith; the faith of God's elect; that works by love, and purifieth the heart,</HI> Col. ii. 12. Tit. i. 2. Gal. v. 5.</P>
<P>But then, the&s;e works, or fruits, that proceed from faith, and as done by the believer, are not conditions of life: the believer doth not obey God expecting up|on
<PB N="43" REF="007860_0042_102DE98E0FC8E4C0">
that account to enter into glory. The obedience which &s;prings from faith, follows after a per&s;on in &s;ome &s;en&s;e enjoys eternal life, not after he is put in actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it; but after he hath had the fore|ta&s;tes of it. For, <HI>he that believeth on Chri&s;t hath ever|la&s;ting life,</HI> John iii. 36. He hath it in the promi&s;e, and in hope; he hath it in his expectation and experience; he hath the earne&s;t of everla&s;ting life. For <HI>faith is the &s;ub&s;tance of things hop'd for, the evidence of things not &s;een,</HI> Heb. xi. 1. As to faith, that is the gift of God, therefore cannot be a condition; and the acting of faith, and the fruits thereof, are no conditions, being the works of God; I mean that he is not only the <HI>author,</HI> but the <HI>fini&s;her of faith.</HI> And good works are what follow after a per&s;on hath received the deed of conveyance, where|by the crown and kingdom are made &s;ure to the believer; Chri&s;t being <HI>in him the hope of glory.</HI> Suppo&s;e you be&s;tow a great favour on an enemy, and he having received it, is convinced of his evil in behav|ing in &s;uch a manner towards you as he hath done in time pa&s;t; your kindne&s;s melts his heart, and his hatred is now turned into love, and he is ready to do you all the &s;ervice he can. Now what he doth is not a con|dition to obtain your favour, having no rea&s;on to think you are his enemy; and as when you fir&s;t be&s;towed your favour upon him he was your enemy, his obedi|ence goeth not before, but follows after he received the favour; and therefore cannot be a condition of his ob|taining it, but a fruit and con&s;equent of his receiving it. So in the ca&s;e before us; the elect, as well as others, are by nature enemies to God, and he finds them &s;o when he comes to be&s;tow this great favour (eternal life) upon them, in giving them the earne&s;t thereof, <HI>Eph.</HI> ii. 1, 8. <HI>Col.</HI> i. 21. When &s;alvation is made known, and
<PB N="44" REF="007860_0043_102DE99091E6E2C0">
applied to the &s;oul, there is a thorough conviction of &s;in, the heart is melted down into holy contrition, 'tis won over to the Lord, <HI>it is made willing in the day of his power,</HI> P&s;a. cx. 3. The man that before was an enemy to God, is now his friend, and filled with love to him; and the language of &s;uch an one is, <HI>Lord, what wilt thou have me do?</HI> Acts ix. 6. But here is no doing as a condition, 'tis all the fruit and effect of that faith whereby the &s;oul hath laid hold on Chri&s;t as his &s;a|viour; &s;uch a per&s;on hath no view to what he doth as a condition to purcha&s;e any thing thereby; he hath a kingdom in hope, and is firmly per&s;uaded he &s;hall actu|ally enjoy it in due time, according to <HI>Col.</HI> iii. 3, 4. <HI>For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Chri&s;t in God. When Chri&s;t, who is our life, &s;hall appear, then &s;hall we al&s;o appear with him in glory.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore, what a true believer doth is not a condi|tion, but the fruit, and effect of God's love, manife&s;ted in be&s;towing &s;uch a favour, as eternal life upon him, and follows after the favour is received. When any thing is offered by way of condition, the thing offered cannot be enjoyed, in any &s;en&s;e, 'till the condition be perfor|med; but this we &s;ee is not the ca&s;e before us with re|ference to true believers; &s;uch an one hath a well-grounded hope, having the fir&s;t, or foreta&s;tes of heaven; this he hath before he has gone through a cour&s;e of obedience; for this for the mo&s;t part is given in when he is converted to God. Heaven is no &s;urer at the end of a Chri&s;tian's journey, than at the begin|ning, with reference to the purpo&s;e and promi&s;e of God. But if heaven was promi&s;ed on conditions to be performed by man, it could not be &s;o; for then there could be no a&s;&s;urance of enjoying the happine&s;s promi&s;ed 'till the conditions are performed; and no
<PB N="45" REF="007860_0044_102DE993615CB9C8">
per&s;on could be &s;ure that he &s;hould enter into the king|dom of glory 'till he comes there: for as entering into glory would then depend on per&s;evering in a cour&s;e of &s;incere obedience to the end of a man's life, and per&s;e|vering in holine&s;s depending on the will of the creature, no per&s;on could be certain he &s;hould endure to the end and &s;o be &s;aved; the will being fickle and liable to change; and thus a man mu&s;t be all his life-time &s;ubject to bondage. But ble&s;&s;ed be God, the promi&s;e of eter|nal life hangs not upon &s;uch a feeble &s;tring. 'Tis true, tho&s;e per&s;ons which enter into glory, are &s;uch, and &s;uch only, as do per&s;evere unto the end, <HI>and are faithful unto death;</HI> but their entering into glory doth not de|pend upon this as a condition. I grant, they cannot enter into glory without per&s;evering to the end, but then that is not condition of it. I a&s;k, cannot a thing be nece&s;&s;ary as a <HI>qualification,</HI> and yet not be a condition?</P>
<P>What is a condition? <HI>An&s;wer,</HI> A condition implies a &s;tipulation or covenant between two per&s;ons, the one promi&s;ing, the other performing. Or, a condition is the doing &s;ome work, or &s;ervice, which hath a promi&s;e (but not a free one) annexed to the doing of the work; the condition (as to the fulfilling of it) lieth on the doer, and giving the reward on the promi&s;er; &s;o that a con|dition is the doing &s;ome work or &s;ervice, in order to ob|tain &s;ome good, which reward becomes due when the work is done, and not before. Therefore a condition doth not &s;uppo&s;e a proportion between the works and the reward, but always &s;uppo&s;es, that receiving the re|ward promi&s;ed, depends upon doing; or performing the condition, what&s;oever it be, more or le&s;s, according to the agreement; and is given upon that account, though the full value be not paid down. Therefore, the per|forming the condition is not only the way and means
<PB N="46" REF="007860_0045_102DE9950C586A68">
to come at the reward, but it is the purcha&s;ing of it: and to &s;ay eternal life is promi&s;ed on conditions to be performed by man, is the way to bring man under the covenant of works, God &s;tipulating with man, <HI>do this and live;</HI> I promi&s;e thee life upon the&s;e conditions.</P>
<P>It may be thought perhaps by &s;ome that the follow|ing propo&s;ition is true <HI>(viz.)</HI> eternal life is obtained by Chri&s;t, and promi&s;ed to man on conditions of faith, re|pentance, and &s;incere obedience.</P>
<P>But, in my opinion, this is not true; for as it throws part of the work on the creature, it thereby le&s;&s;ens, if it does not quite invalidate the performance of Chri&s;t. For if Chri&s;t obtained eternal life for all that believe in him, what occa&s;ion is there to hang it upon conditions to be performed by the creature? If the reward be promi&s;ed to man upon conditions of &s;omething done to procure it, this mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that Chri&s;t has done but a part, and that the other part belongs to man to do, and upon his doing it the reward is given. Nay, it follows, that what Chri&s;t hath done is in&s;ufficient, and of no a|vail, without man's part; and how contrary this is to the go&s;pel, every one I &s;hould think mu&s;t &s;ee, that un|der&s;tands what go&s;pel is.</P>
<P>Eternal life is promi&s;ed to all that believe in the Son of God, the only mediator and &s;aviour of &s;inners, and &s;hall certainly be given to all &s;uch, according to the expre&s;s word of God.</P>
<P>But then eternal life is both promi&s;ed and given alone for the &s;ake of Chri&s;t, and what he hath done. For, <HI>this is the record, God hath given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. Therefore he that hath the Son, hath life; and he that hath not the &s;on, hath not life. The promi&s;e of life is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> 1 John v. 11, 12. 2 Tim. i. 1.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="007860_0046_102DE996CE8B7320">God will give what he hath promi&s;ed, and at the time, and in the way which he hath promi&s;ed: but where hath God promi&s;ed, that if thou believe&s;t, he will give thee eternal life <HI>for thy believing?</HI> The promi&s;e is made to <HI>believers,</HI> but not to believing. Therefore if thou believe&s;t on the Son of God, he will give thee eternal life for Chri&s;t's &s;ake.</P>
<P>If any &s;hould a&s;k, where is the difference between promi&s;ing eternal life to the per&s;on, and to the work, or to the per&s;on for his work's &s;ake? I an&s;wer, there is a great, and very nece&s;&s;ary difference. For promi&s;ing eternal life to per&s;ons of &s;uch characters as believers, upon the con&s;ideration of what another hath done, is very agreeable to, and con&s;i&s;tent with <HI>a free promi&s;e,</HI> or <HI>promi&s;e of grace:</HI> for, though the promi&s;e be made to the <HI>believer,</HI> the ground of it lies <HI>in Chri&s;t, and what he hath done.</HI> But if the promi&s;e was to run conditi|onal, and &s;o to re&s;t upon what the per&s;on doth him&s;elf, it could not be of free grace, but of works. <HI>For if the inheritance be of the law</HI> (or works) <HI>it is no more of promi&s;e,</HI> (i. e. <HI>it is not of free promi&s;e</HI>) <HI>but God gave it to</HI> Abraham <HI>by promi&s;e.</HI> If faith, repentance, and &s;in|cere obedience be the terms and conditions of man's en|tering into glory, then heaven mu&s;t be given (in part at lea&s;t) upon that account: for, if I promi&s;e a per&s;on &s;uch a reward for doing &s;uch a work, I give him the re|ward for doing the work; neither do I &s;ee any way to avoid this, for, if faith, repentance, and &s;incere obedi|ence, be the conditions of life, then heaven is given for the &s;ake of faith, repentance, and &s;incere obedi|ence, and &s;o Chri&s;t is &s;hut out; for, it is ab&s;urd, as well as impertinent to &s;ay, eternal life is given to man for the &s;ake of Chri&s;t, and for the &s;ake of what man doth too. 'Tis written, <HI>The gift of God is eternal life, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord,</HI> Rom. vi. 23. Now
<PB N="48" REF="007860_0047_102DE999A970B038">
when it is &s;aid, <HI>through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord,</HI> is there any occa&s;ion to add this &s;upplement, <HI>through faith, re|pentance, and &s;incere obedience?</HI> To &s;ay that faith, re|pentance, and &s;incere obedience, are required as nece&s;|&s;ary qualifications in the &s;ubjects of &s;alvation, is &s;peak|ing the truth; but to &s;ay they are included in the above pa&s;&s;age as conditions, is fal&s;e: and whatever any per&s;on may think, it is plain enough to me, that there is a ma|nife&s;t di&s;tinction between the&s;e terms, <HI>qualification</HI> and <HI>condition,</HI> and that the former only hath place in the matter we are upon. It may be truly &s;aid, that faith, and true go&s;pel-repentance and &s;alvation, cannot be &s;e|parated; and yet, faith and repentance are not conditi|ons of &s;alvation. Strange! very &s;trange! that faith and repentance can't be brought in as <HI>qualifications,</HI> without making them <HI>conditions.</HI> The&s;e are ways and means which God hath appointed to &s;it and prepare per&s;ons for eternal life to &s;uch as are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with tho&s;e qualifications above-named; and they &s;hould be put upon &s;eeking after faith and repentance, which are the gifts of God, <HI>Acts</HI> v. 31. xi. 18. <HI>Eph.</HI> ii. 8. <HI>Phil.</HI> i. 29. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> ii. 25.</P>
<P>And they &s;hould not be put upon doing, no, nor be|lieving neither as a condition of life, for, the difference is not great, between <HI>do and live,</HI> and, <HI>believe and live.</HI> For, believing is an act of the creature (though under the influence of the &s;pirit of God) and as &s;uch a work.</P>
<P>The common way of &s;tating the ca&s;e is thus&mdash;<HI>God doth not now require perfect and &s;inle&s;s obedience of man in order to his entering into life; for Chri&s;t having by his obedience and death, or, at lea&s;t by what he hath done, removed the law in its covenant-form, and there|by made way for man's acceptance upon go&s;pel-&s;inceri|ty; life is promi&s;ed not to perfect, but &s;incere doing; or,
<PB N="49" REF="007860_0048_102DE99C411469B8">
faith, repentance and &s;incere obedience, are now the con|ditions of life, and terms of acceptance.</HI></P>
<P>But as this way of &s;tating the ca&s;e makes eternal life to be of works, and not of grace, it mu&s;t be fal&s;e. <HI>Not of works, le&s;t any man &s;hould boa&s;t. Not by works of righteou&s;ne&s;s which we have done,&mdash;by grace we are &s;aved.</HI>&mdash;For this rea&s;on therefore it mu&s;t be fal&s;e, being contrary to expre&s;s te&s;timony of holy &s;cripture, <HI>Rom</HI> iii. 19, to 29. <HI>Eph.</HI> ii. 9. <HI>Tit.</HI> iii. 5. The di&s;tinction of perfect and imperfect, or, perfect and &s;incere obedience as a condition of life, I find not in the word of God; it cannot be go&s;pel to &s;ay eternal life is put upon, not perfect, but &s;incere doing, as the condition whereby it mu&s;t be obtained; for where do we find eternal life promi&s;ed to &s;incere doings? 'tis promi&s;ed to no doings at all. '<HI>Tis God's free gift, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord,</HI> Rom. vi. 23. Good works are not the way to eternal life; <HI>Chri&s;t is the way,</HI> the way of acceptance with God, and the way of admi&s;&s;ion into heaven; good works are found in and done by all that walk in this way (Chri&s;t) neither is, nor can true faith be without them, when and where there is opportunity to do them, <HI>Jam.</HI> ii. 17, 18, 20. And yet good works will never be the cau&s;e of bringing any per&s;on to the kingdom of glory; no, nor are they &s;o much as the condition of per&s;ons entering in there.</P>
<P>Thus it appears, that the hope of eternal life re&s;teth on the free promi&s;e of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; whereas, was it conditional, then the whole would re&s;t upon the performance of tho&s;e conditions from whence it mu&s;t be very uncertain whether any would enjoy it. But when our hope re&s;teth on the free promi&s;e of God, nothing more is nece&s;&s;ary to give a believer a comfortable a&s;&s;u|rance of entering into glory, but a &s;teady and firm reli|ance

And this is a notable ground to re&s;t upon for &s;trong con&s;olation; and gives the greate&s;t encouragement to &s;en&s;ible &s;inners: for why may not I hope for eternal life, if God has convinced me of &s;in, and the need of a Saviour, and kindled in my &s;oul &s;in|cere de&s;ires and longing after Chri&s;t, and eternal life and happine&s;s in and through him? and if I am willing to accept of it as his free gift, though I am unworthy of the lea&s;t of his favours, yet Chri&s;t is worthy, and upon his account, I, a poor mi&s;erable &s;inner, may expect the greate&s;t favour, eternal life.</P>
<P>Once more: That eternal life is not conditional, but a free gift, is further evident, if we con&s;ider when the promi&s;e was made, and to whom it was made per&s;onal|ly: we are told, that <HI>the promi&s;e of eternal life was made before the world began,</HI> Tit i. 2. Now, to whom could this promi&s;e be made &s;o early? to whom but the Son of God in the capacity of a mediator; and who did actually &s;tipulate with the father in behalf of his elect people; and to him was the promi&s;e made, and to him it was conditional. The thing promi&s;ed was eter|nal life, and it was the elect, true believers that were to enjoy it: but the promi&s;e being made to the Son of
<PB N="51" REF="007860_0050_102DE99F9498D3C0">
God, as the &s;urety of his people, there were certain conditions injoined him, upon the performance of which, eternal life was to be given to the elect, that is, all that believe in him for life and &s;alvation.</P>
<P>For though heaven be the free gift of God, yet the elect are not put into the actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the King|dom without the con&s;ideration of what Chri&s;t hath done in their behalf; 'tis by, and through Chri&s;t, his perfect obedience, and compleat &s;atisfaction, which gives the &s;aints a right and title to eternal life. <HI>He came that we might have life</HI>&mdash;John x. 10. And <HI>it is tho&s;e that receive abundance of grace, and the gift of righteou&s;|ne&s;s that &s;hall reign in life by one Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI>&mdash;The dear redeemer bled and died upon the cro&s;s, he was made &s;in and a cur&s;e for his people, that thereby he might deliver them from &s;in, the cur&s;e, and wrath of God; and thus <HI>hath he obtained eternal redemption for all them that obey him. And thus doth God, by making this captain of &s;alvation perfect through &s;uffer|ing, bring many &s;ons to glory: and herein he hath acted as became him&s;elf;</HI> as a holy and ju&s;t, as well as merciful God, <HI>Heb.</HI> ii. 10. and ix. 12.</P>
<P>We &s;hould carefully ob&s;erve the connection there is between the end and the means; for the though nothing is to be done by man as a condition to obtain life, yet there are ways and means appointed by God, for all tho&s;e to walk in, which travel to eternal glory: and tho&s;e ways and means leading on to the end, are included in the fundamental decree of election, as may be &s;een in many places of &s;cripture, <HI>Rom.</HI> viii, 29. 30. <HI>Eph.</HI> i. 4. 2 <HI>The&s;.</HI> ii. 13. So that tho&s;e things which are requi&s;ite to be found in, and done, by the heirs of &s;alvation, are what they are cho&s;en to, and are the fruits and effects of God's everla&s;ting love, the foundation of all.&mdash;And
<PB N="52" REF="007860_0051_102DE9A25A34D108">
in this righteous and gracious decree of election. God hath &s;hewn a &s;trict regard to the holine&s;s of his people, as well as to their happine&s;s; the&s;e things, <HI>(viz.)</HI> holi|ne&s;s and happine&s;s, he has joined together, and no man &s;hall ever be able to put them a&s;under. How lovely, and how beautiful, doth this connection appear in that famous place of Saint <HI>Paul&mdash;Rom.</HI> viii. 29. 30, <HI>For whom he did foreknow, he al&s;o did prede&s;tinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the fir&s;t-born among many brethren. Moreover, whom he did prede&s;tinate, them he al&s;o called: and whom he he called, them he al&s;o ju&s;tified; and whom he ju&s;tified, them he al&s;o glorified.</HI> To this I &s;hall only add that well known and very excellent pa&s;&s;age, <HI>Eph.</HI> i. 4. <HI>According as he hath cho&s;en us in him, before the foundation of the world,</HI> (ob&s;erve) <HI>that we &s;hould be holy and without blame before him in love.</HI></P>
<P>We mu&s;t al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;h between what is the ground and foundation, or chief cau&s;e of giving the kingdom to the elect; and the way and means which bring them to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. The ground o giving the king|dom, is God's &s;overeign good will and plea&s;ure, and thus it is ab&s;olutely a free gift. <HI>It is your father's good plea&s;ure to give you the kingdom,</HI> Luke xii. 32. But then, in a &s;econdary &s;en&s;e, what Chri&s;t hath done is the meritorious cau&s;e of the elect's enjoying the king|dom; and then in the next place come in all the ways and means, as preparatory, or, as fitting and preparing them for the actual enjoyment thereof; the&s;e ways and means are all included in what is called an habitual and actual meetne&s;s for death and glory. But then tho&s;e ways, means, and qualifications, are no cau&s;es nor conditions of entering into the kingdom; they are things nece&s;&s;ary and beautiful in their place. And here are two dangerous rocks to be avoided, (1) We
<PB N="53" REF="007860_0052_102DE9A50AB9B270">
mu&s;t be careful not to make the ways and means con|ditions of &s;alvation. (2) We mu&s;t take care no to be regardle&s;s of, or lightly e&s;teem the ways and means which God has appointed for us to be found in the u&s;e of; and &s;o pre&s;umptuou&s;ly expect to enter into glory, while we are in the direct road to hell. For it is writ|ten, <HI>Except ye repent, ye &s;hall all likewi&s;e peri&s;h. And without holine&s;s no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord. Ex|cept a man be born again, he cannot &s;ee the kingdom of God,</HI> Luke iii. 3, 5. Heb. xii. 14. John iii. 3.</P>
<P>There is not only an expediency, or fitne&s;s, but an inimitable beauty, in this connection of ways and means with the end. For, as on the one hand, it would mar the grace of God, to give heaven for the &s;ake of works; &s;o, on the other hand, it would reflect on the purity and holine&s;s of God, to admit (could &s;uch a thing be) per&s;ons into heaven without holine&s;s, or his glorious image delineated in their hearts. As I would therefore caution all to take heed, not to build their hopes and expectations for eternal life on their works, or any thing in them, or done by them; &s;o I would likewi&s;e exhort all per&s;ons to &s;earch their hearts, and &s;ee whether they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with tho&s;e qualifications which are in&s;eparable from the heirs of &s;alvation. And according to the advice of an in&s;pired apo&s;tle, <HI>Ex|amine your &s;elves whether ye be in the faith, prove your own &s;elves, how that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is in you, ex|cept you be reprobates,</HI> 2. Cor. xiii. 5. Look into the bible, &s;ee and ob&s;erve what was the temper, and what the conduct of tho&s;e which are gone before to inherit the promi&s;es.

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON THE DOCTRINE OF MERIT.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Doctrine of Merit</HI> makes but little noi&s;e in the world, being generally denied by <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> or &s;uch as live under that name, except tho&s;e called <HI>Papi&s;ts;</HI> and every one thinks he can &s;ee there is no merit in the creature, that &s;inful man can merit no good thing at the hand of God. But, it is a que&s;tion, whe|ther many that di&s;claim merit in words, do not own it in fact, tho' they may not be &s;en&s;ible of it them&s;elves. It may, therefore, be of &s;ome &s;ervice to have this mat|ter cleared up, that &s;o it may appear to every &s;erious thinking per&s;on, that the everla&s;ting &s;alvation of a &s;in|ner is not owing to the merit of the creature, but to the grace of God in his dear &s;on. Free grace is generally talked of, but too little under&s;tood; and there is, I am afraid, as much ignorance among people about good works; what they are, and what is their proper place.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="007860_0058_102DE9B164B9A450">The doctrine that I &s;hall fix upon, to try this matter by, will be that of ju&s;tification; I mean, the ju&s;tifica|tion of a &s;inner in the &s;ight of God. And my bu&s;ine&s;s will be, to con&s;ider, whether this be owing to the me|rit of man, or, to the grace of God.</P>
<P>And, as nothing is authentic that is not built upon the word of God, I &s;hall therefore ground my di&s;cour&s;e upon that divine pa&s;&s;age of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> Rom. iv. 4, 5. <HI>Now to him that worketh, is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that ju&s;tifieth the ungodly; his faith is counted for righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>From the&s;e words I &s;hall rai&s;e two ob&s;ervations:</P>
<P>(I.) That who&s;oever worketh, with a view to be ju&s;|tified thereby in the &s;ight of God, &s;eeks ju&s;tification by merit, or de&s;ert; and not according to the pure grace of God: <HI>Now to him that worketh, is the reward reckoned not of grace, but of debt.</HI></P>
<P>(II.) That who&s;oever worketh not with &s;uch a view, or expectation, to be accepted, or ju&s;tified, in the &s;ight of God thereby, but by faith depends on God, and expects to be ju&s;tified by and through what Chri&s;t hath done for him; &s;uch an one is ju&s;tified by, and accord|ing to the free grace of God. <HI>But to him that work|eth not, but believeth,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations are fully contained in the words:</P>
<P>&mdash;And that the &s;ubject, the apo&s;tle treats of, is ju&s;tifi|cation, is evident from the chapter in general, and par|ticularly from <HI>ver&s;e</HI> the <HI>&s;econd. For if</HI> Abraham <HI>were ju&s;tified by works, he hath whereof to glory, but not before God.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="007860_0059_102DE9B30F2336B0">The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> thing to be con&s;idered is, that who&s;oever worketh with a view to be ju&s;tified thereby, in the &s;ight of God, &s;eeketh ju&s;tification by merit, and not accord|ing to the true grace of God. Perhaps it may be thought &s;trange by &s;ome, that I &s;hould u&s;e the word merit, &s;eeing all di&s;claim every kind and degree of it, except <HI>Papi&s;ts.</HI> But to this I an&s;wer, I apprehend the word <HI>merit,</HI> to be of the &s;ame &s;ignification with the term <HI>debt,</HI> or <HI>de&s;ert;</HI> and, that this matter may be &s;et in a clear light, I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew, what that merit is, that may be a&s;cribed to man, or to any rational be|ing and how far a meer creature may be &s;aid to merit: and, I hope, if it can fairly be made to appear, that, to &s;eek ju&s;tification by works of our own performing, is &s;eeking it by our own merits, per&s;ons will be &s;en&s;ible of the folly of &s;uch a conduct. Now if any thing be done, by way of condition, as the terms of our ac|ceptance with God, then it is of merit, or de&s;ert. Con|ditional &s;alvation, or, conditional ju&s;tification, cannot exclude merit.</P>
<P>What is merit? An&s;wer; There are two kinds of merit; proper, and improper: proper merit, is called merit of condignity; that is, &s;trict and real merit. Im|proper merit is called merit of paction, that is by cove|nant, or agreement. Now, as to the fir&s;t, merit of condignity, or &s;trict and real merit; this cannot be a&s;|cribed to any meer creature, man, or angel; this would be to &s;uppo&s;e the creature not beholden to it's creator; for merit of condignity, or proper merit, &s;uppo&s;es &s;uch worth or de&s;ert, or &s;uch dignity and real excellency in the per&s;on and his work, as the reward may be ju&s;tly claimed upon it; and that the per&s;on is not at all be|holden to him who gives the reward, becau&s;e 'tis meri|ted.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="007860_0060_102DE9B62DE10690">This is proper merit, which may take place between one man and another, but not between man and his maker: mankind, being equal by nature, may oblige one another; that is, one man may lay another under an obligation to reward him; for, when one man me|rits a reward of another, he is not at all obliged to him for the reward; he that gives the reward is as much obliged to him that receives it, for his work, or &s;ervice, as he that receives the reward is to him that gives it; for he that receives, has merited what he receives; and he that gives, gives but what is the other's due: but this cannot take place between God and a meer crea|ture; the creature being dependent upon the creator, mu&s;t be beholding to him for all it receives, and be un|der the greate&s;t obligations to the giver; 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for the creature to lay the creator under any obligati|ons:&mdash;all the creature receives mu&s;t be of meer fa|vour.&mdash;We &s;ee therefore, merit, &s;trictly &s;peaking, can|not be a&s;cribed (not only to man, but not) to any meer creature. None but the Son of God could merit, in a &s;trict and proper &s;en&s;e; neither did he ab&s;olutely me|rit in that &s;en&s;e, as I &s;hall &s;hew anon.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Merit of paction, or by covenant-agreement. In this &s;en&s;e, the word merit is often u&s;ed, though it be improper, at lea&s;t 'tis not &s;trictly merit; but it will bear the term: in this &s;en&s;e it may take place between God and a meer creature; and there can be no other merit a&s;|cribed to a meer creature; for what&s;oever God be&s;tows on a meer creature, is in a way of favour; and this kind of merit is con&s;i&s;tent with the goodne&s;s and bene|ficence of God to his creatures, but takes place only with perfect beings; it being not con&s;i&s;tent with the perfec|tions of God thus to covenant with a &s;inful creature, except it be for ble&s;&s;ings of a much lower nature, than tho&s;e that relate to the eternal happine&s;s of &s;inful man;
<PB N="62" REF="007860_0061_102DE9B84F411720">
(<HI>viz.</HI> &s;uch as relate to this pre&s;ent life) for what the creature merits by compact, or agreement, it doth not &s;trictly de&s;erve; but yet, 'tis due, by virtue of the co|venant-agreement. And hence 'tis clear, as the &s;un at noon-day, that ju&s;tification, by our own works, is ju&s;ti|fication according to merit; 'tis a debt, 'tis a due, ac|cording to agreement. For, if God promi&s;e to ju&s;tify man, on his &s;incere obedience, then when he has per|formed that obedience, his ju&s;tification follows as a debt, or merit; for no creature can merit any other way: therefore, if you would di&s;claim all merit, you mu&s;t di&s;claim conditional ju&s;tification; for, to pretend to di&s;claim any other merit is impertinent, becau&s;e no other merit can be a&s;cribed to men or angels. To &s;ay we can merit nothing, that is, &s;trictly de&s;erve, is nothing to the purpo&s;e: this is no ways peculiar to us as fallen creatures, but may as well be affirmed of an innocent creature. For <HI>Adam,</HI> in innocency, could merit no other way, but by paction, <HI>i. e.</HI> by covenant-agreement; all that was be&s;towed on him, and promi&s;ed to him, was of the meer favour of God. I very much que&s;tion, whether it be not here that many per&s;ons make the mi&s;|take: they &s;ay, they do not pretend to merit; they know they de&s;erve no favour from the hand of God; but then by merit they mean &s;trict and proper merit; which is out of the que&s;tion in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e; be|cau&s;e merit, in this &s;trict and proper &s;en&s;e, is excluded from all kind of beings; <HI>i. e.</HI> rational and intelligent creatures, perfect as well as imperfect; whereas, if, at the &s;ame time that we di&s;claim all merit, we are con|tending for ju&s;tification by works, or conditional &s;alva|tion, we are contending for all the merit that can be|long to any creature. <HI>Adam</HI> could merit no otherwi&s;e; God made a covenant with him; promi&s;ed him life up|on

conditions of perfect obedience: it was the meer favour of God thus to &s;tipulate with man; and had he per&s;evered in perfect obedience, the time allotted for his probation, he would have merited life; it would have been a debt according to agreement and promi&s;e. &mdash;And, to &s;uppo&s;e God has now e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;uch a co|venant with fallen man, that, on his &s;incere obedience, he will receive him into favour, and that his own works &s;hall be the terms of his acceptance, is, to &s;uppo&s;e man placed on the &s;ame footing he was before he fell; the difference is this; innocent man was to merit by a per|fect obedience, but fallen man by an imperfect &s;incere one. Therefore, if we are contending for ju&s;tification by our own works, we are &s;o far from excluding merit, that we are contending for all the merit that can be a&s;|cribed to any meer creature.</P>
<P>For, if God hath &s;tipulated with man, promi&s;ing to ju&s;tify, and accept him upon certain conditions perfor|med; then, when the&s;e conditions are performed, the reward is due; that is, God is under obligation, accord|ing to his promi&s;e, to ju&s;tify and accept him, upon the terms propo&s;ed. And this is the very thing intended in the&s;e words, <HI>Now to him that worketh, is the re|ward not reckoned of grace, but of debt;</HI> i. e. the re|ward is given him not of meer favour, but of merit, as what is due according to agreement.</P>
<P>Therefore, if we would be clear in this matter of ju&s;tification (and which doubtle&s;s, is of the greate&s;t im|portance) we mu&s;t carefully di&s;tingui&s;h between proper and improper merit; and, con&s;ider, that no real merit can be a&s;cribed to any creature; not only fallen man cannot merit in this &s;en&s;e, but that mu&s;t be the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to perfect creatures; and that improper merit cannot be a&s;cribed to fallen man, without bring|ing

him under a covenant of works; God &s;tipulating and promi&s;ing, and man performing certain conditions as the terms of his acceptance; which intirely &s;huts out free grace, according to that divine oracle, <HI>Rom.</HI> xi. 6. <HI>But if it be of works, then is it no more of grace; o|therwi&s;e work is no more work.</HI> And, furthermore, that no meer creature can properly merit, is evident; becau&s;e no meer creature can do more than is its indi&s;|pen&s;ible duty to do; and, in order to merit, the crea|ture mu&s;t do more than is it's bounden duty to do: hence it is, that none pretend to merit, being &s;en&s;ible they cannot do more than 'tis their duty to do: but this regards real merit, which, &s;trictly &s;peaking, we have nothing to do with, as no meer creature can merit in this &s;en&s;e. <HI>Adam</HI> did not, elect angels cannot, and all profe&s;&s;ed <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> di&s;claim it, except the <HI>Papi&s;ts;</HI> who, to e&s;tabli&s;h the doctrine of merit, croud in their &s;uppo&s;ed works of &s;upererogation, which is giving, or doing, more than is required; doing more good works than a man is bound by the law of God to do. And, could any meer man do this, he might merit; but this is a meer fiction of the brain.</P>
<P>Therefore, &s;eeing no merit can be a&s;cribed to man, but that of paction, how plain is it that ju&s;tification, by works, is e&s;tabli&s;hing the doctrine of merit; not real and proper merit, but all the merit that can belong to man; whether he be con&s;idered as innocent and free from &s;in, or, as a fallen &s;inful creature: for, as all the de&s;ert that can be a&s;cribed to perfect obedience, mu&s;t take its ri&s;e from the meer favour of God, &s;tipulating with the creature, and promi&s;ing &s;uch a reward upon &s;uch an obedience; &s;o all the de&s;ert that can be a&s;cri|bed to a &s;incere imperfect obedience, mu&s;t al&s;o ari&s;e from the meer favour of God, thus &s;tipulating with man,
<PB N="65" REF="007860_0064_102DE9BFDC0A8338">
and promi&s;ing him &s;uch a reward upon his perorming &s;uch obedience.</P>
<P>If any &s;hould from hence argue, that if it is owing to the meer favour of God, that a &s;inner is ju&s;tified by his own &s;incere obedience, then what hurt can merit do? I an&s;wer; The favour of God, in the ca&s;e fir&s;t men|tioned, is ea&s;y to conceive of.&mdash;And the &s;econd is only a &s;uppo&s;ed ca&s;e, at lea&s;t it appears &s;o to me. I do not believe God has made &s;uch a covenant with man, as that upon his faith, repentance, and &s;incere obe|dience, he will ju&s;tify and receive him into favour. However, if &s;ome will maintain that &s;o it is,&mdash;and that though it be of works, this cuts not off the favour of God,&mdash;I cannot, perhaps, tell what they may mean by the favour of God.&mdash;However, in that way of &s;tating the ca&s;e, it appears to be very different from the love of God, that is &s;o highly celebrated in the go&s;pel; and which I apprehend is ab&s;olutely free and uncon|ditional.</P>
<P>However, let it be ob&s;erved, and which I am cer|tain mu&s;t be the ca&s;e, that though it be owing to the meer favour of God to make &s;uch a conditional cove|nant as before ob&s;erved, yet the conferring the reward on man, when he has performed the conditions of that covenant, cannot be a&s;cribed to the meer favour of God, but to the merits of man. And as this merit, or de&s;ert, turns intirely on what the creature doth, &s;o man hath a right to plead with God on the foot of his own works: for, if God has promi&s;ed to accept &s;incere o|bedience, as the terms of the &s;inners acceptance, then it is &s;trictly ju&s;t to plead upon this footing; though there be a very di&s;proportion between the works, and the reward, yet when the work is done, the wages is due. Suppo&s;e you promi&s;e or agree to give me five

&s;hillings, upon condition I will go with you one mile, and I agree to the terms and go; are the five &s;hillings due to me, or not? Every one will grant 'tis due, be|cau&s;e it is a fair bargain; it might be a favour in you to make the promi&s;e, but 'tis a piece of ju&s;tice in you to pay the money; and the plea for it mu&s;t be grounded, not upon your favour, but upon the contract.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e appears to be plainly this:&mdash;If God has made &s;uch a covenant with man, that his faith, repen|tance, and &s;incere obedience, be the terms of his accep|tance, then it mu&s;t be of debt, or merit; and, if the favour of God, in making &s;uch a conditional grant, is all that is intended by the grace of God in the go&s;pel, I think it is hardly worth while to keep up the di&s;tinc|tion any longer between works and grace, &s;eeing the whole centers at la&s;t in works; and the grace, that is talked of, is &s;o metamorpho&s;ed, that there is great dan|ger of mi&s;taking it for works. Every thing we enjoy is owing to the grace of God, as grace &s;tands in oppo&s;i|tion to real merit. But the grace of God in the go&s;|pel, is &s;omething peculiar, and is to be &s;een or di&s;cern|ed no where el&s;e, but in the per&s;on of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> who is the &s;um of the go&s;pel. God's ju&s;tifying a &s;in|ner or the foot of works, and on the foot of grace, are as far a&s;under as the ea&s;t and the we&s;t.</P>
<P>It is plain, by the apo&s;tle, in the words under con|&s;ideration, that debt and grace are two di&s;tinct things; and, 'tis no le&s;s evident, that his de&s;ign is to throw out one, and e&s;tabli&s;h the other; and which way can this be done, in ca&s;e we are ju&s;tified by our own works? it mu&s;t then be reckoned not of grace, but of debt. If my own obedience be the matter of my acceptance with God, I a&s;k again, where is <HI>free grace?</HI> admit|ting it was grace to make &s;uch a conditional grant, to
<PB N="67" REF="007860_0066_102DE9C476A620A8">
make &s;uch a favourable covenant, of &s;uch mild terms, yet I am bold to affirm, there is not a mite of <HI>free grace,</HI> in giving forth the ble&s;&s;ing of the covenant. And, upon this footing, what little occa&s;ion is there for a mediator between God and man; I &s;uppo&s;e it is &s;ome way owing to him, that God has made &s;uch a conditi|onal covenant of &s;uch ea&s;y terms; and this is making as little u&s;e of him as can be, if any u&s;e is made of him: this is not to make him the <HI>alpha and omega, the begin|ning and the end, all and in all;</HI> which, to do, is to bring in &s;alvation by grace.</P>
<P>To make <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> the &s;ole meritorious cau&s;e of our ju&s;tification and acceptance with God, and good works the fruits and effects of true faith, is &s;peaking the lan|guage peculiar to the covenant of grace; which &s;huts all manner of works out as cau&s;es, conditions, or means of our ju&s;tification in the &s;ight of God.</P>
<P>For, for the reward to be reckoned of grace, is for it to be reckoned without the con&s;ideration of any thing done by the creature: <HI>To him that worketh not, but believeth on him that ju&s;tifieth</HI>&mdash;i. e. To him that per|forms nothing as a condition of his ju&s;tification, but is willing to receive all as the free gift of God,&mdash;<HI>his faith is counted for righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Faith, it&s;elf, is not the righteou&s;ne&s;s; for faith, or believing, &s;tands in direct oppo&s;ition to working; whereas believing, as 'tis an act of man, is a work: and then where is the antithe&s;is? The apo&s;tle is not di&s;tingui&s;hing between works per|fect and imperfect: works, as to their nature, kind, or degree, are not the thing in debate; but works and grace are the things in di&s;pute, and to which of the&s;e our ju&s;tification is to be a&s;cribed; and 'tis plain that be|lieving is &s;et in oppo&s;ition to working, therefore it can|not be faith it&s;elf, but what faith was fixt upon; which
<PB N="68" REF="007860_0067_102DE9C68E05A538">
was a righteou&s;ne&s;s di&s;tinct from faith, called a <HI>righte|ou&s;ne&s;s imputed without works,</HI> i. e. without any works done by the per&s;on to whom it is imputed; I &s;ay, with|out any works done by the per&s;on him&s;elf as the ground of his ju&s;tification. This righteou&s;ne&s;s is plain enough di&s;tingui&s;hed from faith, called the righteou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>the faith,</HI> Rom. iv. 6,&mdash;11. called al&s;o, <HI>the righteou&s;ne&s;s which is by faith of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, unto all, and upon all them that believe.</HI> Note, 'tis not inherent in them, but 'tis <HI>unto</HI> and <HI>upon;</HI> ob&s;erve al&s;o, 'tis a righteou&s;|ne&s;s which cometh <HI>by</HI> believing, <HI>'Tis by faith of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> Rom. iii. 22. thus it is a froe gift of meer fa|vour, or pure grace.</P>
<P>(II.) The <HI>&s;econd</HI> ob&s;ervation is, Who&s;oever worketh with no &s;uch view, or expectation, to be accepted and ju&s;tified thereby in the &s;ight of God, but by faith de|pends on God, expecting to be ju&s;tified by and through what Chri&s;t hath done for him, &s;uch an one is ju&s;tified by, and according to, the free grace of God. <HI>But to him that worketh not, but believeth,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>To him that worketh not,</HI> that maketh not his works a condition of his ju&s;tification,&mdash;for the apo&s;tle is &s;peaking of the end and view which per&s;ons have in working; he doth not condemn works, but is enquiring after the principle they proceed from,&mdash;<HI>but believeth, his faith receiveth a righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> whereby he is ju&s;tified in the &s;ight of God; &s;uch an one is ju&s;tified as <HI>Abraham</HI> was, by the &s;ame righteou&s;ne&s;s.&mdash;<HI>Now, it was not written for his &s;ake alone, that it was imputed to him; but for us al|&s;o, to whom it &s;hall be imputed, if we believe on him that rai&s;ed up Je&s;us our Lord from the dead; who was delivered for our offences, and was rai&s;ed again for our ju&s;tification,</HI> Rom. iv. 23, 24. There is no
<PB N="69" REF="007860_0068_102DE9C8D4F88F90">
merit but the merit of Chri&s;t, who may be &s;aid to merit for us; for as it has been ob&s;erved, that a per&s;on may merit, he mu&s;t do more than is his bounden duty to do. Now, Chri&s;t certainly did more than the law could in&s;i&s;t upon, more than the law could require of man; his obedience being the obedience of God as well as man, <HI>For the fulne&s;s of the God-head dwelt in him bodily; And he is the true God;&mdash;God over all, ble&s;&s;ed for ever;</HI> the dignity of his per&s;on, <HI>being the only begotten Son of God,</HI> together with the perfection of his work, made it an exalted merit; he may be &s;aid to de&s;erve at the hand of God. But then this was al&s;o by paction; by a compact, or covenant-agreement, between the Father and him, and he is called the &s;urety of that covenant, <HI>Heb.</HI> vii, 22. and viii. 6.</P>
<P>Could we con&s;ider what Chri&s;t did as &s;eparate from the covenant, would there have been any merit in it? at lea&s;t, it could not have been available for us; for Chri&s;t could not thereby have laid God under any ob|ligation; he was at liberty whether he would accept of a &s;urety, and what he &s;hould do for &s;inners.</P>
<P>So that here the very &s;trictne&s;s of merit &s;eems to be cut off; though, I think, it mu&s;t be granted, there was an inifinite merit of condignity in what Chri&s;t did; yet we cannot argue the ju&s;tification of a &s;inner in the &s;ight of God barely from thence, without a con&s;idera|tion of the covenant. What he did became available for our ju&s;tification, becau&s;e it was &s;o agreed upon be|tween them both, that his fulfilling or giving the law its full demands, &s;hould an&s;wer for the ju&s;tification and eternal &s;alvation of tho&s;e for whom it was done.</P>
<P>And this is a way of ju&s;tification becoming God, as his honour is no ways impaired;&mdash;<HI>The law is magni|fied and made honourable;</HI> ju&s;tice is fully &s;atisfied,&mdash;
<PB N="70" REF="007860_0069_102DE9CB5146E9A0">
<HI>Mercy and truth are met together, righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace have ki&s;&s;ed each other,</HI> P&s;al, lxxxv. 10.</P>
<P>And thus the freedom and &s;overeignty of God, are &s;ecured, in di&s;pen&s;ing his grace to &s;inners; for that he is laid under no obligation by what Chri&s;t hath done, but what he by covenant brought him&s;elf under. Had Chri&s;t, by whad he did, laid God under an obligation to ju&s;tify &s;inners, had he done this, I &s;ay, without any con&s;ideration of a covenant between then, then God could not (in the affair of ju&s;tifying &s;inners) act as a &s;overeign; for he, being obliged by Chri&s;t, mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily have conferred the grace of ju&s;tification upon &s;in|ners. But the great and ble&s;&s;ed God is above being obliged; and though what he doth, in ju&s;tifying the ungodly, is infinitely, worthy of him&s;elf, yet he doth it freely; it was a voluntary, yea &s;overeign act, in him, to enter into covenant with his own Son, and ju&s;tify &s;inners upon his account.</P>
<P>Thus, God hath e&s;tabli&s;hed ju&s;tification in a way be|coming him&s;elf; and it is &s;uch a way as is highly ho|norable to him, and exceeding delightful to men&mdash;<HI>For he is ju&s;t, and the ju&s;tifier of every one that believeth in Chri&s;t,</HI> Rom. iii. 26.</P>
<P>Such honour is done to the divine law, as could ne|ver have been done by the obedience of men, no, nor by all the men upon earth, and angels in heaven. So that there is in Chri&s;t a double merit; a merit of con|dignity, <HI>i. e.</HI> of real worth, and a merit of paction, <HI>i. e.</HI> by covenant-agreement; which, both con&s;idered toge|ther, is the highe&s;t of perfection of merit, and far above any meer creature to do. And the ju&s;tification of a &s;inner, being in and through the merit of Chri&s;t, is en|tirely
<PB N="71" REF="007860_0070_102DE9CCF315D5C8">
of free grace, according to the holy &s;criptures,&mdash;<HI>Being ju&s;tified freely by his grace,</HI> Rom. iii. 24.</P>
<P>And it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the ju&s;tification of a &s;inner, in the &s;ight of God, (for I &s;peak not of declara|tive ju&s;tification, which is the privilege made known to a believer) is alone by and through what Chri&s;t hath done; there is nothing that man doth is brought into the account; and thus it is purely of free grace; there being nothing con&s;idered in the creature, or done by the creature, as the cau&s;e, condition, or mean thereof; <HI>For, if by grace, then is it more of works,</HI> Rom. xi. 6. Whereas, if any thing done by man was brought into the account of ju&s;tification in the &s;ight of God, it could not be alone by Chri&s;t, and of free grace; but, <HI>being ju&s;tified from all things by Chri&s;t</HI> (exclu&s;ive of any thing, and every thing, in, or done by, man) it is entirely of meer favour, owing to the free, rich, and &s;o|vereign grace of God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P>Free &s;overeign grace, reigning grace is the founda|tion of a poor &s;inner's ju&s;tification in the &s;ight of God. It was pure grace in God to enter into covenant with his own Son; and it was equally the &s;ame grace in the Son to become the meritorious cau&s;e of our ju&s;tification. To con&s;ent <HI>To be delivered for our offences, and rai&s;ed again for our ju&s;tification.</HI> To become <HI>the Lord our righteou&s;ne&s;s, And, the end of the law for righteou&s;|ne&s;s to every one that believeth,</HI> Rom. iv, 25, and, x. 4.

Thus is the mouth of man &s;topp'd for ever, as to any boa&s;ting in him&s;elf; but faith receiving a righteou&s;ne&s;s can boa&s;t and glory in the Lord, accord|ing to that very excellent pa&s;&s;age of the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Paul.</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> i. 30, 31. <HI>As it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>From what hath been &s;aid on this &s;ubject, it is very
<PB N="72" REF="007860_0071_102DE9CE9DA84518">
plain, that to exclude the doctrine of merit, and yet con|tend for ju&s;tification by works, is only ca&s;ting away the name, while the thing it&s;elf remains: Men are, it may be, a&s;hamed to contend for the doctrine of merit, but at the &s;ame time will boldly contend for ju&s;tification by their own obedience; which is the doctrine of merit; for there can be no other merit a&s;cribed to man, than that of paction, or, covenant-agreement. The que&s;tion then may be, what &s;hall we do? &s;hall we own and contend for the doctrine of merit, or, &s;hall we not? would a creed formed after the following manner me|rit e&s;teem among &s;uch as are called prote&s;tants; <HI>(viz)</HI> "I believe in God the Father, who hath made a con|ditional covenant with fallen man, in which is required &s;incere obedience as the terms of his acceptance. I be|lieve in Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Son of God, who by his death hath rendered God propitious to &s;inners on &s;uch ea&s;y terms as &s;incere obedience. Al&s;o, I believe that not|with&s;tanding all that Chri&s;t hath done, the whole, as to the issue, is left to re&s;t on the will of man, to make it effectual, or ineffectual. Finally, I believe that good works are meritorious, or, that by them, according to the go&s;pel-covenant, the &s;inner merits heaven." How &s;hocking &s;oever this may appear to any man, I am not as yet convinced that it is any way incon&s;i&s;tent with ju&s;tification by a man's own work. Indeed good works are not to be ca&s;t out of practical divinity: Good works mu&s;t be done; there is a &s;trict and in&s;eparable conjunc|tion between ju&s;tification by grace and the performance of good works, as is abundantly evident from that fa|mous place, <HI>Tit.</HI> iii. 5, 6, 7, 8. <HI>Not by works of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, which we have done, but according to his mer|cy be &s;aved us by the wa&s;hing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t: which he &s;hed on us abun|dantly,

through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Saviour. That being ju&s;tified by his grace, we &s;hould be made heirs, accord|ing to the hope of eternal life. This is a faithful &s;ay|ing, and the&s;e things I will that thou affirm con&s;tantly, that they which have believed in God, might be careful to maintain good works: the&s;e things are good and profitable to men.</HI> But what I &s;ay is, good works have no place in the ju&s;tification of a &s;inner before God. And, it de&s;erves to be con&s;idered, whether ju&s;tification by Chri&s;t be not &s;peaking more honourably of God, and propo&s;ing a way much &s;afer for men than the con|trary? I think 'tis more honourable&mdash;it brings more honour unto God; for in what an amiable light doth ju&s;tification by grace, repre&s;ent the ble&s;&s;ed God. As infinitely ready, or, propen&s;e in him&s;elf to ju&s;tify the ungodly; for we are not to &s;uppo&s;e that what Chri&s;t did brought God into a di&s;po&s;ition to acquit a guilty creature; No external motives moved him hereunto: but what Chri&s;t did made it con&s;i&s;tent with all o|ther perfections of Deity to ju&s;tify &s;inners. The love of God to his cho&s;en people is an everla&s;ting free love: God was, I &s;ay, ready enough to ju&s;tify; but could not in any other way but this, con&s;i&s;tent with his ju&s;tice, holine&s;s, and truth. But now, <HI>he is ju&s;t, and the ju&s;tifier, of him which believeth in Je&s;us,</HI> Rom. iii. 26.</P>
<P>And this way of ju&s;tification is much &s;afer for men; is it not a &s;urer foundation to re&s;t upon, to tru&s;t in a perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s, which is an ab&s;olute &s;ecurity from condemnation for ever? Whereas, if it depends upon our own performances, then every time a per&s;on relap&s;es into &s;in he is brought under condemnation: but this is not the ca&s;e with reference to &s;uch as are ju&s;tified by Chri&s;t; though when &s;uch an one falleth into &s;in he has

And I mu&s;t affirm, (whatever any per&s;on may think to the contrary) that this doctrine of ju&s;tification by Chri&s;t alone, I mean as before ob|&s;erv'd, ju&s;tification in the &s;ight of God, I treat of no other now; therefore as to what hand the grace of faith may have in the application of this ble&s;&s;ing, and how far works, as fruits of faith may evidence our ju&s;|tification before men, I determine not now to con&s;ider. This doctrine, I &s;ay, of free ju&s;tification by Chri&s;t alone is a doctrine of godline&s;s; and, in my opinion, will ne|ver fail of influencing tho&s;e that heartily embrace it, to practical godline&s;s. Corrupting and denying this doc|trine of ju&s;tification, is one chief cau&s;e of the &s;o great abounding of &s;in among&s;t us; corruption of doctrine produces corruption of manners; communion and clo&s;e walking with God are the effects of receiving <HI>the truth in the love of it.</HI></P>
<P>The clearer views I have of this doctrine, and the &s;tronger my faith is, the more humble I am, and the more abundantly is my heart drawn forth in unfeigned thankfulne&s;s, and lively and chearful obedience. <HI>The love of Chri&s;t con&s;traineth us.</HI>&mdash;O what returns &s;hall I make for love &s;o va&s;tly great. I am nothing&mdash;Chri&s;t

is all and in all. In him I am compleat.&mdash;And how exceeding lovely and engaging doth he appear, as <HI>the Lord our righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>And though ju&s;tification, by an imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s, be a riddle that many cannot unfold, yet certainly&mdash;<HI>out of the &s;trong cometh forth &s;weetne&s;s.</HI>&mdash;No doctrine &s;o &s;weet, &s;o full of the mo&s;t &s;olid joy. Free grace! O de|lightful theme! with how much plea&s;ure could I dwell upon the harmonious &s;ound! my &s;oul is almo&s;t ready to melt within me, in the delightful views of ju&s;tificati|on by free grace! And how am I tran&s;ported at the thoughts of what many of the dear children of God have &s;uffered for this precious doctrine. Hark! from the dungeon, how the poor pri&s;oners &s;ing for joy of heart!&mdash;And what their notes?&mdash;O 'tis grace! Rich grace! Free grace! Chri&s;t, none but Chri&s;t and his righteou&s;|ne&s;s!&mdash;Salvation alone by Chri&s;t&mdash;O how did the pri&s;ons, in per&s;ecuting times, ring with this doctrine!&mdash;Look yonder! methinks I &s;ee a pile of wood lighted up, and clo&s;e by it &s;tand, in appearance, a poor object con|demn'd to the flames! &s;ee how he &s;miles, while death in all its dreadful forms &s;tares him in the face, yet hea|ven is in his countenance; Behold the executioners, full of rage and fury, &s;tand a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee with what heroick courage and divine plea&s;ure the poor &s;ufferer embraces the flames,&mdash;counting it all joy. Why &s;o? Becau&s;e <HI>Chri&s;t is in him the hope of glory.</HI> With a heart, overflowing with joy, he cries, O &s;weet <HI>Je&s;us!</HI> Lamb of God! my hope, my life, my all! in thy ble&s;|&s;ed garment I &s;hall appear without &s;pot &s;oon&mdash;and I &s;hall &s;hine in paradi&s;e in the &s;potle&s;s robes of Chri&s;t's righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Therefore this doctrine I mu&s;t abide by, 'till I can find another that will produce better effects,&mdash;clo&s;er

walking with God, and more joy and peace in the Ho|ly-Gho&s;t. And as I do not expect, &s;o neither can I de&s;ire, a &s;weeter doctrine than this is, a doctrine that a|ba&s;es the creature to the lowe&s;t, and exalts the Redee|mer to the highe&s;t. The chief thing I want, is, to enter further into the knowledge of it, and by faith live more upon it. And I am confidently per&s;uaded the heavens will &s;weetly ring of free ju&s;tification by Chri&s;t alone; every &s;aint, being a miracle of grace, will labour to rai&s;e his notes to the highe&s;t key, 'till the glorious man&s;ions re&s;ound with loud ho&s;annas, all <HI>&s;houting, grace, grace unto it.</HI></P>
