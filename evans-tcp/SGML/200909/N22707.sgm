<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE former Volumes of our Hi&s;tory were pub|li&s;hed under great di&s;advantages. The fir&s;t of them came out in the height of our war, when all the power of Britain was exerted to compel America to give up her mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential rights; while one &s;ect here were as earne&s;t to compel all others to &s;ubmit to their power in religious matters. How difficult then was it for a very imperfect man to give a ju&s;t view of the&s;e affairs! And the many mi&s;takes of the printers rendered the work &s;till more ob&s;cure. And though the Second Volume was better compo&s;|ed, and more correctly printed, yet the la&s;t part of it was hurried through the pre&s;s, &s;o as to prevent its being fini&s;hed as I intended. Yet I know not of any public di&s;pute about the truth of facts in the Hi&s;tory. Many have privately di&s;covered their di&s;|like of the publication of them, becau&s;e their own &s;chemes of power and gain were expo&s;ed thereby.</P>
<P>For the capital &s;cheme of policy, for two centuries pa&s;t, both in Europe and America, hath been to maintain a balance of power among the nations, and among religious &s;ects, &s;o as to compel all to &s;ubmit to government. And a man of great knowledge in Penn&s;ylvania, when he read my Fir&s;t Volume, in 1779, &s;aid in a letter to me "I think it needs not a &s;pirit of prophecy to predict, that America is to be &s;tained with the blood of the &s;aints. I am afraid there is a foundation laid for it already. I wi&s;h it may not be with particular de&s;ign. Formerly there was a proper balance of power between Epi&s;copalians and Di&s;&s;enters, taken in England and America together; but now that balance is lo&s;t. Formerly there was a
<PB N="iv" REF="030011_0003_0FE3BCAE8B9F5398">check on the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of power in America, by an appeal to the crown; but where &s;hall the per&s;e|cuted Americans appeal now? Not to Congre&s;s, not to the united force of America: they di&s;claim any &s;uch right: they will be judges of no &s;uch matters. They can then only appeal to their oppre&s;&s;ors and accu&s;ers." And he had the following rea&s;ons for his fears: The American war began between Epi&s;copa|lians and Congregationali&s;ts, and the Pre&s;byterians joined with the latter, and they were the uppermo&s;t party in Penn&s;ylvania through the war. And when the Warren A&s;&s;ociation &s;ent an agent to Philadel|phia, while the fir&s;t Congre&s;s was &s;etting there, in 1774, the members of it from the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts plainly manife&s;ted that they would &s;ooner yield to the power of Britain, than they would give up their power of &s;upporting Congregational mini&s;ters by tax and compul&s;ion. And Bo&s;ton, where the war be|gan, was the only place in America where they had hanged men for religion. And an eminent man in Virginia &s;ays, "Several acts of the Virginia A&s;&s;em|bly, of 1659, 1662 and 1693, had made it penal in parents to refu&s;e to have their children baptized; had prohibited the unlawful a&s;&s;embling of Quakers; had made it penal for any ma&s;ter of a ve&s;&s;el to bring a Quaker into the State; had ordered tho&s;e already here, and &s;uch as &s;hould come thereafter, to be im|pri&s;oned till they &s;hould abjure the country; pro|vided a milder puni&s;hment for the fir&s;t and &s;econd return, but death for their third.&mdash;If no capital exe|cutions took place here, as did in New-England, it was not owing to the moderation of the church, or &s;pirit of the legi&s;lature, as may be inferred from the law it&s;elf; but to hi&s;torical circum&s;tances which have not been handed down to us."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jeffer&s;on's Notes on Virginia, p. 167.</NOTE> Though the following things may alter his mind.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="v" REF="030011_0004_0FE3BD00F3F3CE00">
1. The light of revelation hath ever enlarged the capacities of men beyond any other means in the world, &s;o that wars among &s;uch have been the mo&s;t de&s;tructive of any upon earth. Half a million of men were &s;lain in one day, in a battle between Ju|dah and I&s;rael. 2 Chron. xiii. 17. And we have no record of &s;uch a &s;laughter in any other day &s;ince Adam fell. And the Quakers were &s;o fierce again&s;t the teachers and rulers of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, that they did not &s;ee how they could po&s;&s;ibly keep up their religious government, without hanging &s;ome of them. Our fir&s;t volume, p. 322&mdash;331. But the government of Virginia was in no &s;uch danger from them.</P>
<P N="2">2. The fir&s;t of tho&s;e laws in Virginia was made but ju&s;t before Charles the Second came to the throne, who put a &s;top to tho&s;e bloody executions here; and no man has been hanged &s;ince for relig|ion, in England or America.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Quakers hold that their children are born in their church, which, by a &s;ecret policy, has been upheld as one great body in Europe and America; and they held &s;o much with Britain in the late war, that two of them were hanged, and others were ban|i&s;hed, by the government of Penn&s;ylvania, as ene|mies to their country. But as the Bapti&s;ts hold all religion to be per&s;onal, between God and individu|als, and that all church power is in each particular church, it is impo&s;&s;ible for them ever to form any great body, that can be dangerous to any civil gov|ernment. The Bapti&s;ts and Quakers have therefore been unju&s;tly ranked together, when their principles are oppo&s;ite to each other. And when the church of Chri&s;t &s;hall come to be governed wholly by his laws, independent of all the inventions of men, all &s;ectarian di&s;tinctions will cea&s;e, and wars will come to an end. Though Europe and America are now &s;o far from this, that &s;ectarian di&s;tinctions are often
<PB N="vi" REF="030011_0005_0FE3BB10422C1B48">begun with capitals, while tho&s;e important names, Chri&s;tian and Chri&s;tianity, are begun with &s;mall letters.</P>
<P>And as I have met with &s;ome high claims of &s;ectarian power in 1783, that I had not &s;een when our Second Volume was publi&s;hed, I begin this in that year; and through the whole have compared actions and events with the word of God, according to the be&s;t light I could gain from every quarter. For as the Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts have now determined not to revi&s;e their con&s;titution of government, and they, with three other States, are con&s;tantly oppre&s;&s;ing the Bapti&s;ts, while they are u&s;ing all their arts to entice all into the u&s;e of force to &s;upport religious mini&s;ters, there appears to be great need of holding up light again&s;t the&s;e evils.</P>
<P>The li&s;t of Bapti&s;t churches in our &s;outhern States, and of &s;ome in New-England, I have taken from Mr. John A&s;plund's Regi&s;ter, for 1794; but the mo&s;t of them in New-England are taken from later accounts. As he was at Bo&s;ton when my li&s;t was printed, he prevailed with my friends there to in&s;ert &s;ome names that I did not intend to have mentioned.</P>
<P>This Volume was written with an expectation of clo&s;ing it with 1795, but as it was not fini&s;hed till June, 1796, &s;ome things are added in this year. All the dates are &s;et in old &s;tyle, until the new took place, in 1752.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. WHEN peace was re&s;tored to America, &s;he entered upon &s;uch a new &s;tate of political exi&s;tence as no people were ever in before. All the govern|ments among men that ever were before formed, were forced upon the people by a few powerful lead|ers, or el&s;e were given by immediate in&s;piration from God. But the people in this land have framed their own governments, and elected their own rulers, with|out in&s;piration from Heaven, or violence from men. Though in doing the&s;e things, they have gone through great changes, which have di&s;covered many
<PB N="10" REF="030011_0009_0FE3BCB768C13270">of the corruptions of men, and of the infinite perfec|tions of God. And a plain record thereof in New-England, e&s;pecially as to religious affairs, may be very &s;erviceable to mankind. In&s;tructive and u&s;eful hi&s;|tories of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> military, civil and political concerns, have been already publi&s;hed; but the &s;tate of our churches &s;ince the war, hath been but &s;lightly touch|ed. Therefore an account of the &s;tate of religion, and of the government of our churches, is here at|tempted. And as Connecticut hath ever elected her own rulers, and made her own laws, they have fram|ed no new con&s;titution of government &s;ince the rev|olution, but only altered their laws as they thought proper.</P>
<P N="2">II. And to prepare the way for a new &s;y&s;tem of laws, the pre&s;ident of their univer&s;ity &s;aid to their legi&s;lature, "Dominion is founded in property; and re&s;ides where that is, whether in the hands of the few or many." And he held that the power of re|ligious mini&s;ters is derived by an external &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from the apo&s;tles, through the churches of Rome and England; and &s;aid of New-England, "The induc|tion of the mini&s;ters of the fir&s;t churches was per|formed by lay brethren, and this was called ordina|tion, but &s;hould be con&s;idered what in reality it was, only induction or in&s;talment of tho&s;e who were ve&s;ted with official power. The&s;e were all ordained before by the bi&s;hops in England." And he encour|aged them to go on in &s;upporting &s;uch mini&s;ters by force, by &s;aying, "God be thanked, the &s;enatorial <HI>A&s;&s;embly</HI> of this happie&s;t of all the United States, &s;till embo&s;oms &s;o many Phineha&s;es and Zerubbabels, &s;o many religious patriots, the friends of Je&s;us and his holy religion: And that the Me&s;&s;iah's cau&s;e is here accompanied with <HI>civil government</HI> and the <HI>prie&s;thood;</HI> allu&s;ively the <HI>two olive trees upon the right of the candle|&s;tick</HI> (the churches) <HI>and upon the left; the two golden branches, which through the two golden pipes,</HI> Mo&s;es and
<PB N="11" REF="030011_0010_0FE3BD0E5E1562B0">Aaron, <HI>empty the golden oil out of them&s;elves,</HI> and diffu&s;e their &s;alutary influence of order and happine&s;s through the community. Zech. iv. 11. As to nom|inal Chri&s;tianity, I have no doubt but that it will be uphold for ages in the&s;e States. Through the liberty enjoyed here, all religious &s;ects will grow up into large and re&s;pectable bodies. But the Congregation|al and Pre&s;byterian denomination, however hitherto de&s;pi&s;ed, will, by the ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven, continue to hold the greate&s;t figure in America, and, notwith|&s;tanding all the fruitle&s;s labours and exertions to pro&s;elyte us to other communions, become more numerous than the whole collective body of our fel|low prote&s;tants in Europe. The whole pro&s;elyti&s;m of New-England in particular for &s;ixty or &s;eventy years pa&s;t, has not exceeded eight or ten thou&s;and, while our augment in that term, by <HI>natural increa&s;e,</HI> has been half a million."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Election Sermon at Hartford, May 8, 1783. By Ezra Stiles, D. D. Pre&s;ident of Yale College, p. 8, 61, 73.</NOTE></P>
<P N="3">III. The&s;e things were publi&s;hed by the highe&s;t authority in Connecticut, ju&s;t after the news of peace arrived, and many were plea&s;ed therewith. But we would now de&s;ire to a&s;k a few que&s;tions. And fir&s;t, as it is ea&s;ier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than it is for any who <HI>tru&s;t in riches</HI> to enter into the kingdom of God, how can dominion be founded in property?

God was the only law-giver to the church of I&s;rael; and Phine has and Zerubbabel were no more than executors of the laws of God in that church. And he never allowed any to u&s;e force in the collection of the &s;upport of his mini&s;ters therein; but every man was to bring in the tithes and offerings which he required of them, as they would de&s;ire his ble&s;&s;ing, and to e&s;cape his awful cur&s;e. Mal. iii. 7&mdash;12. Even &s;o hath the Lord ordained, that they who preach the go&s;pel &s;hould live of the go&s;pel. 1 Cor. ix. 14.

<P N="4">IV. A willing obedience to all the revealed will of God, and about his hou&s;e and wor&s;hip in particu|lar, was the way in which he made them high above all other nations, e&s;pecially in the days of David and Solomon; and they were no otherwi&s;e a holy people, than as they obeyed all his commandments, and as the vi&s;ible pre&s;ence of God was among them, in his tabernacle and temple. Yet the above pre&s;ident of the &s;econd univer&s;ity in America, took the la&s;t of the&s;e ver&s;es for his text, and applied that promi&s;e of God to I&s;rael, which they could only enjoy in obedi|ence to his laws, unto the people of America, and e&s;pecially to tho&s;e of the Congregational and Pre&s;by|terian denomination, who &s;upport their mini&s;ters by the laws of men, enforced by the &s;word. Yea, and the rulers who make and enforce tho&s;e laws, received their power from the people, who can take it away again at the next election, while &s;aid mini&s;ters hold their power by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from Europe, and that no men can ordain mini&s;ters but mini&s;ters who hold to &s;uch a power; and when they have ordained them over a particular &s;ociety, that &s;ociety mu&s;t be forced to &s;upport them, until mini&s;ters will relea&s;e them there|from. But if the people have given never &s;o much for the &s;ettlement of a mini&s;ter, he can leave them when he plea&s;eth, if other mini&s;ters will approve of it, and the people can have no recompen&s;e. Thus <HI>partiality</HI> is e&s;tabli&s;hed by law; and the root of it is the yoke which mini&s;ters have laid upon children in

<P N="7">VII. The wi&s;dom of this world is here remarka|bly di&s;covered. And a mini&s;ter who was born in Connecticut, has lately &s;aid of their religion, "The be&s;t in the world, perhaps, for a republican govern|ment. As to the mode of exerci&s;ing church govern|ment and di&s;cipline, it might not improperly be call|ed a republican religion."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mor&s;e's Geography, third edition, 1791, p. 109.</NOTE> Yet it may be &s;ervice|able to review the way by which it was introduced, and by which it grew up to its pre&s;ent height. Our fathers who planted Plymouth colony, held that the church of Chri&s;t was to be governed by his laws, <HI>independent</HI> of all the laws of men; and they never would &s;upport religious mini&s;ters by force &s;o long as governor Bradford lived, which was thirty-&s;even years after they came to Plymouth. But, the next year after they came into the u&s;e of force for that purpo&s;e, two Quakers were hanged at Bo&s;ton. The <HI>congregational</HI> name was invented by the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, who held that the church ought to govern the world, and to force all to &s;ubmit to their power. And when that power was in great danger, partly by the increa&s;e of the Bapti&s;ts among them, one of their greate&s;t mini&s;ters &s;aid, "It is made by learned and judicious writers, one of the undoubted rights of &s;overeignty to determine what religion &s;hall be publickly profe&s;&s;|ed and exerci&s;ed within their dominions. Why el&s;e do we in New-England that profe&s;s the doctrine of Calvin, yet practi&s;e the di&s;cipline of them called Independent, or Congregational churches, but becau&s;e the authority of the country is per&s;uaded that it is mo&s;t agreeable to the mind of God?"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hubbard's Election Sermon at Bo&s;ton, May 3, 1676, p. 35.</NOTE> But their charter was taken away eight years after, and in 1692 their &s;econd charter took place, which gave the world a power above the church about religious

<P N="8">VIII. The Pre&s;byterian and Congregational mini&s;|ters in England had formed a connexion together a little before, and the like was tried for in the Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts &s;oon after; but the writings of Mr. John Wi&s;e prevented it. But in the clo&s;e of 1707, a min|i&s;ter who came from the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, was elected governor of Connecticut, and he prevailed to carry that &s;cheme. And it was done by bringing a bill into their legi&s;lature, who met May 13, 1708, which &s;aid, "This a&s;&s;embly, from their own ob&s;ervation, and from the complaint of others, being &s;en&s;ible of the defects of the di&s;cipline of the churches of this government, ari&s;ing from the want of a more explicit a&s;&s;erting the rules given for that end in the holy &s;criptures, from which would ari&s;e a firm e&s;tab|li&s;hment among&s;t our&s;elves, a good and regular i&s;&s;ue in ca&s;es &s;ubject to eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;cipline, glory to Chri&s;t our <HI>head,</HI> and edification to his members, hath &s;een fit to ordain and require, and it is by the author|ity of the &s;ame ordained and required, that the min|i&s;ters of the churches in the &s;everal counties of this government, &s;hall meet together at their re&s;pective county towns, with &s;uch me&s;&s;engers as the churches to which they belong &s;hall &s;ee cau&s;e to &s;end with them, on the la&s;t Monday in June next, there to con&s;ider and agree upon tho&s;e methods and rules for the management of eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;cipline which by them &s;hall be judged agreeable and conformable to the word of God; and &s;hall at the &s;ame meeting appoint two or more of their number to be their del|egates, who &s;hall all meet together at Saybrook at the next commencement to be held there, where they &s;hall compare the re&s;ults of the mini&s;ters of the &s;ev|eral
<PB N="19" REF="030011_0018_0FE3BD2150F38210">counties, and out of, and from them draw a form of eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;cipline." Their college was then at Saybrook, which was afterwards removed to New-Haven. The mini&s;ters met according to appoint|ment, and drew up their &s;cheme of di&s;cipline, which the legi&s;lature, who met October 14, 1708, e&s;tabli&s;h|ed by law. It allows each church to elect her own officers, and to di&s;cipline her members; but if any per&s;on thinks that he is unju&s;tly cen&s;ured, he may appeal from the &s;entence of the church to a con&s;oci|ation in each county, who&s;e &s;entence is to be final and deci&s;ive, if the majority of the mini&s;ters pre&s;ent are in the vote, and not without. Neither can any man obtain a meeting of the con&s;ociation to hear his ca&s;e, unle&s;s an a&s;&s;ociation of mini&s;ters advi&s;e them to meet. At the &s;ame time the mini&s;ters in each county meet in a&s;&s;ociation when they plea&s;e, without any act of their churches, and claim the whole pow|er of licen&s;ing candidates for the mini&s;try, and of ad|vi&s;ing churches whom to call to preach to them. And the mini&s;ters in each county choo&s;e delegates out of their number, to meet once a year in a general a&s;|&s;ociation from each county in their government, to con&s;ult about their affairs, and to complain to their legi&s;lature again&s;t any &s;ociety or per&s;on as they think proper.</P>
<P N="9">IX. And when the Lord poured out his Spirit in a mo&s;t glorious manner in 1741, under the mini&s;try of travelling preachers, they complained of it to their legi&s;lature in October, who ordered a &s;pecial con&s;oci|ation to meet upon it in November, and they declar|ed it to be very <HI>di&s;orderly</HI> for any mini&s;ter to preach in a pari&s;h where another was &s;ettled without his con|&s;ent. And in May, 1742, an act was pa&s;&s;ed by their legi&s;lature, to exclude all their &s;ettled mini&s;ters from any benefit of their laws for his &s;upport, who &s;hould preach in any other pari&s;h without the con&s;ent of the pari&s;h mini&s;ter. And if any man who was not a &s;et|tled
<PB N="20" REF="030011_0019_0FE3BB2EF851A5F8">mini&s;ter, &s;hould preach or exhort in matters of re|ligion, in any pari&s;h again&s;t the con&s;ent of the pari&s;h mini&s;ter, he &s;hould be impri&s;oned until he would give a bond of one hundred pounds not to do &s;o any more; and if any mini&s;ter from other colonies &s;hould come and preach without &s;uch con&s;ent, he was to be carri|ed by authority out of Connecticut government. And becau&s;e one of their &s;ettled mini&s;ters preached two &s;ermons in a Bapti&s;t church, again&s;t the con&s;ent of a Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ter in the town, other mini&s;|ters per&s;ecuted him for five years, until they declared him to be depo&s;ed from his office, and excluded from the communion of their churches, and &s;aid they did it, "In the name of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, ac|cording to the word of God, and the powers inve&s;ted in this con&s;ociation, by the eccle&s;ia&s;tical con&s;titution of this government." Our &s;econd volume, p. 35, 36, 136&mdash;141, 181. Thus they held that the Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t was the head of the government of Con|necticut, and that his laws and theirs were blended together; and is not this a part of my&s;tery Babylon? And they now &s;ay, "All per&s;ons &s;hall be taxed for the &s;upport of the mini&s;try and other charges of the &s;ociety wherein they dwell, who do not attend and help &s;upport any other wor&s;hip." And is not this a <HI>mark</HI> of the bea&s;t? for he is of a &s;carlet colour, and is very changeable. He was, and is not, and yet is. Rev. xiii. 17. xvii. 3, 5, 8. Blood hath ever fol|lowed the &s;upport of wor&s;hip by the &s;word of the magi&s;trate. But where the children of God and the children of the devil dwell in the field of the world, and appear to be &s;uch by their fruits, our Lord &s;ays, Let both grow together until the harve&s;t. Mat. xiii. 30, 38. But in the church we are commanded to turn away from all men who have <HI>a form</HI> of godline&s;s, but deny the power thereof, while we are required to hold fa&s;t <HI>the form</HI> of &s;ound words, in faith and love which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. And this he explains by
<PB N="21" REF="030011_0020_0FE3BD270398DA48">&s;aying, All &s;cripture is given by in&s;piration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for cor|rection, for in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s; that the <HI>man of God</HI> may be <HI>perfect,</HI> throughly furni&s;hed unto all good works. 2 Tim. i. 13. iii. 5, 16, 17. The on|ly rea&s;on why he allows the <HI>men of the world</HI> to make laws, and to enforce them with the &s;word, is becau&s;e they will not obey the laws of God, nor refrain from injuring their neighbours, without &s;uch forcible re|&s;traints. And it is readily granted, that piety, religion and morality, are e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary for the good order of civil &s;ociety, and &s;o are the &s;howers and &s;hines of heaven. But what a figure would any body of men make, if they &s;hould enact laws to determine when the &s;un &s;hould &s;hine, and how often the &s;how|ers &s;hould fall! For the Lord God is a <HI>&s;un</HI> and &s;hield: the Lord will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly. P&s;alm lxxxiv. 11.

<P N="10">X. As Congregational and Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters have done this, and hold to a &s;ucce&s;&s;ive power to do it, which came through the church of Rome, a min|i&s;ter who was born in Connecticut, obtained the title of <HI>bi&s;hop of Connecticut,</HI> in a more direct line than our mini&s;ters have done.

<PB N="22" REF="030011_0021_0FE3BCCEAA398E18">of Connecticut, by three bi&s;hops in Scotland, No|vember 14, 1784, who derived their &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from three bi&s;hops in England, who refu&s;ed to &s;wear alle|giance to king William, after he had driven the popi&s;h king James from the throne. So that his line came directly from the church of Rome, without any con|nexion with the government in Great-Britain for an hundred years pa&s;t. And this bi&s;hop holds that his authority came from Chri&s;t, as much as any can, and &s;ays, "A church in which Chri&s;t has no authority, cannot be his church: It may be the Pope's church, or Luther's church, or Calvin's church, or We&s;ley's church&mdash;but Chri&s;t's church it cannot be, unle&s;s it be founded on his authority and governed by his commi&s;&s;ion.

Until &s;uch a word can be found in their writings, we may boldly reject all pretences to the Chri&s;tian prie&s;thood, in all men who give no evi|dence of their being born again of the Spirit of God. And as &s;oon as this man a&s;&s;umed the character of bi&s;hop of Connecticut, it cau&s;ed great concern in the church of Eng land; and a gentleman of great note therein, wrote a letter to a Bapti&s;t mini&s;ter in New-England, to inform him that tho&s;e bi&s;hops in Scot|land
<PB N="23" REF="030011_0022_0FE3BD2C26331550">had not good authority to con&s;ecrate others, and al&s;o that the people of Connecticut ought to elect their bi&s;hop, before he could lawfully act as &s;uch; and he de&s;ired that &s;ome proper men might be &s;ent over to be ordained by bi&s;hops in England. This letter was &s;hown to many Epi&s;copalians, and one of them in New-York took a copy of it, to lay before a convention of their mini&s;ters, who were to meet at Philadelphia in September. But this affair lay &s;o heavy upon the mind of the &s;aid gentleman in En|gland, that he wrote to Dr. Franklin upon it, October 29, 1785, and informed him that tho&s;e bi&s;hops in Scotland had admitted "prayers for the dead, and extreme unction among them."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hi&s;torical Collections at Bo&s;ton, vol.</HI> 111. <HI>p.</HI> 162. In February, 1795, bi&s;hop Seabury publi&s;hed a letter to his brethren, in the Connecticut papers, in which he &s;tyles him&s;elf "Samuel, by divine permi&s;&s;ion, bi&s;hop of Connecti|cut and Rhode-I&s;land." Though he has but about thirty &s;ocieties in Con|necticut, and four in the State of Rhode-I&s;land.

But as our rulers have &s;olemn|ly &s;worn to renounce all foreign juri&s;diction over America, how can they have a right to give public money to any who hold a commi&s;&s;ion from Europe?

<P N="12">XII. And as little of it appears among a new &s;ect which is now formed in America. For Mr. John We&s;ley, who was ordained a pre&s;byter of the church of England, with a &s;olemn oath to obey and teach her articles of faith, and forms of wor&s;hip; and yet he publi&s;hed a &s;ermon in 1739, again&s;t &s;everal of tho&s;e articles, and he preached again&s;t them in En|gland,
<PB N="24" REF="030011_0023_0FE3BCD612FA42D8">Scotland and Ireland, for above forty years, and then he and his followers, &s;eeing how the Ameri|can war ended, reduced their thirty-nine articles to twenty-four, with new forms of wor&s;hip and order, and publi&s;hed them in London in 1784, and called them, <HI>The Sunday Service in North-America.</HI> Three orders of ordained officers are pre&s;cribed therein, be|&s;ides preachers who are not ordained. And when they ordained the lowe&s;t of the three, they &s;ay, "Will you reverently obey them to whom the charge and government over you is committed, following with a glad mind and will their godly admonitions! An&s;wer, I will endeavour &s;o to do, the Lord being my helper."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sunday Service, p. 283.</NOTE> And many of his followers met a Baltimore in Maryland, December 27, 1784, and drew up a pamphlet, entitled, "A Form of Di&s;ci|pline for the Mini&s;ters, Preachers, and Members of the Methodi&s;t Epi&s;copal Church in America." They allow no man to be a preacher in their church, but &s;uch as profe&s;s a belief that perfection is attainable in this life. They date the beginning of their &s;ocieties in America, from the labours of &s;ome preachers who came over from Ireland about the year 1764; and they &s;ay, "What may we rea&s;onably believe to be God's de&s;ign in rai&s;ing up the preachers called Meth|odi&s;ts? An&s;wer, To reform the continent, and &s;pread &s;cripture holine&s;s over the&s;e lands. As a proof here of, we have &s;een in the cour&s;e of fifteen years a great work of God, from New-York through the Jer&s;eys, Penn&s;ylvania, Maryland. Virginia, North and South-Carolina, even to Georgia." And they &s;ay, "We are thoroughly convinced, that the church of En|gland, to which we have been united, is deficient in &s;everal of the mo&s;t important parts of Chri&s;tian di&s;|cipline; and that (a few mini&s;ters and members ex|cepted) it has lo&s;t the life and power of religion. We are not ignorant of the &s;pirit and de&s;igns it has
<PB N="25" REF="030011_0024_0FE3BD311D1AE998">ever di&s;covered in Europe, of ri&s;ing to pre-eminence and worldly dignities by virtue of a national e&s;tab|li&s;hment, and by the mo&s;t &s;ervile devotion to the will of temporal governors: and we fear, the &s;ame &s;pirit will lead the &s;ame church in the&s;e United States (though altered in name) to &s;imilar de&s;igns and at|tempts, if the number and &s;trength of its members will ever afford a probability of &s;ucce&s;s; and partic|ularly to obtain a national e&s;tabli&s;hment, which we cordially abhor as the bane of truth and holine&s;s, the greate&s;t impediment in the world to the progre&s;s of vital Chri&s;tianity. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, we have thought it our duty to form our&s;elves into an <HI>inde|pendent</HI> church. And as the mo&s;t excellent mode of church government, according to our mature&s;t judg|ment, is that of <HI>a moderate epi&s;copacy;</HI> and as we are per&s;uaded, that <HI>the uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of bi&s;hops from the apo&s;tles,</HI> can be proved neither from &s;cripture nor antiquity; we therefore have con&s;tituted our|&s;elves into an <HI>epi&s;copal church,</HI> under the direction of bi&s;hops, elders, deacons, and preachers, according to the forms of ordination annexed to our prayer book, and the regulations laid down in this form of di&s;ci|pline."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Methodi&s;t Form of Di&s;cipline, printed at New-York, 1787, p. 1&mdash;6, 13, 30.</NOTE> Thus they undertook to be law-givers for all North-America, and to form a church therein that never had any exi&s;tence until the year 1784. And their teachers have taken great pains to draw off peo|ple from all other religious communities in our land, by confounding works and grace together. Mr. We&s;ley held that Chri&s;t died equally for all man|kind, but that men are &s;aved by their own faith and obedience, which yet they may fall from and peri&s;h forever. And he &s;ays, "Unconditional election cannot appear, without the cloven foot of reproba|tion. I believe <HI>election</HI> means, a divine appointment of &s;ome men to eternal happine&s;s. But I believe this election to be conditional, as well as the reprobation

I believe the eternal decree con|cerning both, is expre&s;&s;ed in tho&s;e words, <HI>He that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved; he that believeth not &s;hall be damned.</HI> And this decree without doubt God will not change, and man cannot re&s;i&s;t.

Yet We&s;ley and his followers in&s;i&s;t upon this with daring boldne&s;s.

And he denied that there was any word in the bible, that we could know by it that it meant without end, without other con&s;iderations than the word it&s;elf. And he &s;ays, "In what point of light &s;oever we take a view of &s;in, it is certainly, in its nature, a <HI>finite evil.</HI>&mdash;And the con&s;ideration of hell as a <HI>purging fire,</HI> is that only which can make the matter &s;it ea&s;y upon one's mind."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chauncy on Salvation for all Men, p. 319, 324.

And the fire of God's wrath in a future &s;tate, is &s;o far from being a purging fire, that he &s;ays, Behold, the day cometh that &s;hall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, &s;hall be &s;tub|ble and the day that cometh &s;hall burn them up, &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts, that it &s;hall leave them nei|ther root nor branch.

Again he &s;ays, The hand of the Lord &s;hall be known toward his &s;ervants, and his indignation toward his enemies. For, behold, the Lord will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.

Yea, are not the&s;e the burnings which &s;hall introduce the new heavens and new earth, wherein dwelleth righteou&s;ne&s;s? 2 Pet. iii. 12, 13. For the &s;coffers, walking after their own lu&s;ts, were never &s;o open and daring again&s;t all religion before, in any age or country, as they are now in Europe and America. But the unlearned and un&s;table, wre&s;t the &s;criptures unto their own de&s;truction. 2 Pet. iii. 3, 4, 16. And one way in which this is done, is by putting earthly univer&s;ities in the place of the teach|ing of the Spirit of God, calling them <HI>rivers,</HI> the &s;treams whereof &s;hall make glad the city of God.

<P N="14">XIV. The fir&s;t univer&s;ity in America is in Cam|bridge, where an early example of oppre&s;&s;ion appear|ed after the war. A Bapti&s;t church was con&s;tituted in that town in 1781, and they had a pa&s;tor ordained in 1783; yet they were all taxed for the &s;upport of
<PB N="29" REF="030011_0028_0FE3BD3B51932158">Congregational mini&s;ters, and three men were im|pri&s;oned therefor in 1784. Therefore they &s;ued the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors who taxed them, and their ca&s;e was carried through their inferior and &s;uperior courts in 1785, and was turned again&s;t the Bapti&s;ts, which co&s;t them more than an hundred dollars. The con&s;titution of our government re&s;trained our rulers from making any certificate law, as they did in Connecticut, where|by di&s;&s;enters from the ruling party might be exempt|ed from taxes to their wor&s;hip; and if any per&s;ons might draw off from them without acknowledging that they had power to bind and loo&s;e in &s;uch affairs, the u&s;e of force to &s;upport religious mini&s;ters would come to an end. Therefore a great lawyer informed tho&s;e oppre&s;&s;ed people, that if they would give in certificates to the ruling &s;ect, that they belonged to &s;aid Bapti&s;t &s;ociety, and would have their money go to the mini&s;ter thereof, he might &s;ue the money out of the hands of tho&s;e who took it. This advice he founded upon the words in our con&s;titution which &s;ay, "All monies paid by the &s;ubject to the &s;up|port of public wor&s;hip, and of the public teachers afore&s;aid, &s;hall, if <HI>he</HI> require it, be uniformly applied to the &s;upport of the public teacher or teachers of his own religious &s;ect or denomination, provided there be any on who&s;e in&s;tructions he attends; oth|erwi&s;e it may be paid towards the &s;upport of the teacher or teachers of the pari&s;h or precinct in which &s;aid monies are rai&s;ed." This article was drawn by another great lawyer; and men of that profe&s;&s;ion are <HI>intere&s;ted</HI> in &s;upporting religious teachers by force as really as any men in the world; for a great part of their gains come by controver&s;ies about religion; and when teachers and lawyers are in confederacy to|gether, they will make words to mean any thing which they plea&s;e. And in the above article, they con&s;tru|ed the word <HI>he</HI> to mean the teacher who was to re|ceive the money, and not the man who paid it. And,
<PB N="30" REF="030011_0029_0FE3BCDE5636D038">rather than to &s;uffer continually, tho&s;e Bapti&s;ts in Cambridge complied with the advice of the lawyers, and their mini&s;ter &s;ued the money out of the hands of their oppre&s;&s;ors, from time to time, until they le&s;t off collecting &s;uch money; and the like was done in various parts of the country. Our con&s;titution &s;ays, "All men are born free and equal, and have certain natural, e&s;&s;ential, and unalienable rights." And the right to receive and &s;upport faithful teachers, and to refu&s;e to &s;upport tho&s;e who are unfaithful, is one of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential rights of con&s;cience that can be named; yet this right is daily violated by all men who &s;upport their teachers by tax and compul&s;ion. Again, the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts con&s;titution &s;ays, "No &s;ubordination of any one &s;ect or denomination to another, &s;hall ever be e&s;tabli&s;hed by law." Yet the Congregational denomination have con&s;tantly viola|ted this article al&s;o. Though to hide it, they made a law in March, 1786, which confounded mini&s;terial and civil taxes together, and empowered every man in each town who pays two thirds more in one tax than a poll tax, to vote in &s;uch affairs. And the act &s;ays, "The freeholders, and other inhabitants of each re&s;pective town, qualified as afore&s;aid, at the annual meeting, for the choice of town officers, or at any other town meeting regularly warned, may grant and vote &s;uch &s;ums of money as they &s;hall judge nece&s;&s;ary, for the &s;ettlement, maintenance and &s;up|port of the mini&s;try, &s;chools, the poor, and other nec|e&s;&s;ary charges ari&s;ing within the &s;ame town; to be a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed upon the polls and property within the &s;ame, as by law provided."</P>
<P N="15">XV. Here is not the lea&s;t regard paid to the church of Chri&s;t; but fornicators, drunkards, rail|ers and extortioners, have equal votes with the be&s;t men in the land, to determine who &s;hall be guide for their &s;ouls, and how they &s;hall be &s;upported. And God &s;ays of antichri&s;tian teachers, They are of
<PB N="31" REF="030011_0030_0FE3BD3FE432B170">the world, therefore &s;peak they of the world, and the world heareth them. 1 John iv. 5. But how terrible were the effects of &s;uch things? For the love of the world had induced many to run into debt, and it made others now fierce for calling in their debts, and collectors to get their taxes, which cau&s;ed much bu&s;ine&s;s in courts, and a great increa&s;e of law|yers; therefore a man in Bo&s;ton began to publi&s;h e&s;|&s;ays in their papers again&s;t lawyers, the &s;ame month in which the above law was made, which e&s;&s;ays were collected into a pamphlet in July. And the people felt them&s;elves &s;o much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, that, in Augu&s;t and September, they aro&s;e in arms again&s;t their courts, in the counties of Hamp&s;hire, Berk&s;hire, Worce&s;ter, Middle&s;ex, and Bri&s;tol. Hereupon the town of Bo&s;|ton wrote to all the towns in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, re|que&s;ting them to bring in accounts of their grievances, and promi&s;ing to u&s;e their influence in their favour. And the legi&s;lature was called together, and heard many complaints, and they publi&s;hed an addre&s;s to the people, November 14, 1786, in which they &s;aid, "We feel in common with our neighbours the &s;car|city of money; but is not this &s;carcity owing to our own folly? At the clo&s;e of the war, there was no complaint of it: &s;ince that time, our fields have yielded their increa&s;e, and Heaven has &s;howered its ble&s;&s;ings on us, in uncommon abundance. But are we not con&s;trained to allow, that immen&s;e &s;ums have been expended for what is of no value, for the gew|gaws imported from Europe, and the more pernicious produce of the We&s;t-Indies; and the dread of a pa|per currency impedes the circulation of what re|mains?&mdash; the difficulty in paying debts increa&s;ed, As a di&s;regard to <HI>hone&s;ty, ju&s;tice</HI> and good <HI>faith,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Matt. xxiii. 23.</NOTE> in pub|lic and private tran&s;actions, became more manife&s;t. Some per&s;ons have artfully affected to make a di&s;tinc|tion between the government and the people, as
<PB N="32" REF="030011_0031_0FE3BB2244213488">though their intere&s;ts were different and even oppo|&s;ite; but we pre&s;ume, the good &s;en&s;e of our con&s;tit|uents will di&s;cern the deceit and fal&s;ity of the&s;e in&s;in|uations. Within a few months the authority dele|gated to us will cea&s;e, and all citizens will be equally candidates in a future election." But all their rea|&s;oning could not quiet tho&s;e people; therefore an ar|my was &s;ent up and &s;ubdued them by force. Though in the next election, the governor and above half the legi&s;lature were left out of office, and fourteen men, who had been condemned to be hanged for re|bellion, were all pardoned. And how came religious mini&s;ters to have a higher power over the people, to force away money from them, than our governors or legi&s;lators have? Yea, higher than the kings of Great-Britain? For the mini&s;ters who were formerly &s;upported in the name of tho&s;e kings, and &s;ince in the name of this State, &s;till hold a power above them all. And are they not mini&s;ters of the great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth?

<P N="1">I. AS long as the <HI>fear</HI> of foreign dangers prevail|ed, our Congre&s;s was wonderfully obeyed; but as that fear abated, the <HI>love</HI> of the honours, riches and plea&s;ures of this world weakened their authority, un|til they could not govern this great country. For while &s;ome States made laws to regulate trade, and to guard again&s;t foreign encroachments, other States took advantage to enrich them&s;elves. The&s;e things were very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing in the&s;e northern parts, while the people to the &s;outhward were not benefited there|by. For Virginia had long received their religious teachers from Europe, as well as many civil mer|chants; and Bapti&s;t mini&s;ters had often been impri&s;|oned for preaching the go&s;pel without licen&s;e from Epi&s;copalians, until the war put a &s;top to it. And after the war they tried hard to revive that power again. But the Bapti&s;ts and others prevailed, in the beginning of 1786, to have a law made, which &s;ays, "That no man &s;hall be compelled to frequent or &s;up|port any religious wor&s;hip, place or mini&s;try what&s;oev|er, nor &s;hall be enforced, re&s;trained, mole&s;ted, or bur|thened

So hard is it for men to give up any world|ly advantage which they have obtained under the ma&s;k of religion. The bea&s;t had feet like a bear. Rev. xiii. 2. And no bear ever gra&s;ped harder to hold his prey, than men now do to hold the power and gain which religious pretences have given them. Yet by a motion from Virginia, the Congre&s;s recom|mended it to all the&s;e States, to elect delegates to meet at Philadelphia, in order to form a better plan of government than they then enjoyed. Accordingly twelve States met there by delegation, and laboured upon it for about four months, until they fini&s;hed a new con&s;titution of government on September 17, 1787, and &s;ent it out to all the&s;e States, and &s;ome of them adopted it &s;oon, while others did not receive it in two years. And if men find it to be &s;o hard a matter to agree about the affairs of time, why &s;hould they pretend to force all to unite in the great con|cerns of eternity? If they differ &s;o much about per|i&s;hing things which are vi&s;ible, how can they unite in the &s;ervice of the invi&s;ible Jehovah, who is beloved by his children, and is hated by the world? For ev|ery one that doth evil, <HI>hateth the light;</HI> and Je&s;us &s;ays, <HI>I am the light of the world; but they hated me without a cau&s;e.</HI> John iii. 20. viii. 12. xv. 25. And
<PB N="35" REF="030011_0034_0FE3BD4A9DA7E758">though this hatred hath been covered, in every age, under the name of religion or government, yet the fea&s;t of the go&s;pel, in the church of Chri&s;t, will de|&s;troy the face of the covering ca&s;t over all people, and the vail that is &s;pread over all nations. I&s;a. xxv. 6, 7. The Chri&s;tian nations have laid <HI>bands</HI> upon chil|dren, before they could choo&s;e for them&s;elves, and have forced them to &s;upport the national wor&s;hip all their days. But God &s;ays to his people, Loo&s;e thy|&s;elf from the <HI>bands</HI> of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion. For thus &s;aith the Lord, Ye have &s;old your&s;elves for nought, and ye &s;hall be redeemed with|out <HI>money.</HI>&mdash;Thy God reigneth. This is the <HI>go&s;pel of peace.</HI> I&s;a. lii. 2, 3, 7. Rom. x. 15. And as &s;urely as he reigneth above, no men below can have any right to make laws to bind any in religious affairs. But how hardly are men brought to give up this pow|er over the con&s;ciences of others! For on January 9, 1788, a convention of delegates from all parts of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts met at Bo&s;ton, and debated long upon the new con&s;titution of government which was formed in Philadelphia, until they, with great diffi|culty, adopted it on February 6, by a majority of 187 votes, again&s;t 168.</P>
<P N="2">II. One of the greate&s;t objections that was made again&s;t it, was, that no religious te&s;t was required therein, of any of the officers of government. But after much had been &s;aid upon it, a Congregational mini&s;ter aro&s;e and &s;aid, "The great object of religion being God &s;upreme, and the &s;eat of religion in man being the heart or con&s;cience, that is, the rea&s;on God has given us, employed on our moral actions, in their mo&s;t important con&s;equences, as related to the tribu|nal of God, hence I infer, that God alone is the God of the con&s;cience, and con&s;equently, attempts to erect human tribunals for the con&s;ciences of men, are im|pious encroachments upon the prerogatives of God." But as this did not &s;ilence their objections on that
<PB N="36" REF="030011_0035_0FE3BCE37451EBC0">head, a Bapti&s;t mini&s;ter aro&s;e five days after, and &s;aid, "Nothing is more evident, both in rea&s;on, and in the holy &s;criptures, than that religion is ever a matter between God and individuals; and therefore no man or men can impo&s;e any religious te&s;t, with|out invading the e&s;&s;ential prerogatives of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Mini&s;ters fir&s;t a&s;&s;umed this power un|der the Chri&s;tian name; and then Con&s;tantine ap|proved of the practice, when he adopted the profe&s;|&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity as an engine of State policy. And let the hi&s;tory of all nations be &s;earched, from that day to this, and it will appear that the impo&s;ing of religious te&s;ts hath been the greate&s;t engine of tyranny in the world.&mdash;The covenant of circumci&s;|ion gave the &s;eed of Abraham a right to de&s;troy the inhabitants of Canaan, and to take their hou&s;es, vineyards, and all their e&s;tates as their own; and al&s;o to buy and hold others as &s;ervants. And as Chri&s;tian privileges are much greater than tho&s;e of the Hebrews were, many have imagined that they had a right to &s;eize upon the lands of the heathen, and to de&s;troy or en&s;lave them as far as they could extend their power. And from thence the my&s;tery of iniquity carried many into the practice of making <HI>merchandi&s;e of &s;laves and &s;ouls of men.</HI>" But this was not &s;uffered to be printed in the &s;ame paper in Bo&s;|ton, in which the &s;peech of the Congregational min|i&s;ter was printed. Though the wi&s;dom which is from above, is without <HI>partiality,</HI> and without <HI>hypocri&s;y.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. But men often carry the&s;e evils farther under the name of religion and government, than they can do in any other way. For if any are di&s;hone&s;t in their private dealings, and refu&s;e to perform their prom|i&s;es, others can avoid having any further trading with them; but promi&s;es and oaths are frequently violated in public affairs, when the mo&s;t upright can|not bring the guilty to ju&s;tice, nor e&s;cape from being injured by &s;uch men. A notable in&s;tance hereof
<PB N="37" REF="030011_0036_0FE3BD4F8DFB3D28">now appeared in the State of Rhode-I&s;land. A num|ber of men therein artfully repre&s;ented to the people, that if a large bank of paper money was made, they might ea&s;ily pay off their public and private debts; and they were accordingly elected into their legi&s;la|ture in 1786, and made &s;uch a bank. Some relig|ious teachers were active in this &s;cheme, by which the widow and the fatherle&s;s, with many others, were amazingly defrauded and oppre&s;&s;ed. And in March, 1787, the men who were guilty of the&s;e evils, pa&s;&s;ed an act to cut off every man in the State from voting in their next election of rulers, until they had taken a new oath again&s;t bribery. By &s;uch means they were elected again into office, and they would never allow a convention to be called in that State, to con&s;ider of the new con&s;titution of government for the&s;e United States, until the year 1790;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was adopted there, May 29, 1790.</NOTE> &s;ince which tho&s;e <HI>deceitful men</HI> have been left out of office, and as great harmony is re&s;tored there as in other places. But in all parts of America the public promi&s;es of government are &s;till violated, beyond what men in private &s;tations can po&s;&s;ibly do to each other, and yet continue in power and credit. And no men have &s;uffered more in the&s;e times, than relig|ious mini&s;ters who have con&s;cientiou&s;ly refu&s;ed the u&s;e of force for their &s;upport. And as our Lord &s;ays, My kingdom is not of this world, how can his mini&s;ters have a right to force the world to &s;upport them? How can they exhort rulers and people to venture their eternal all upon the truth of Chri&s;|tianity, if them&s;elves refu&s;e to tru&s;t it for their tem|poral living? Can any wonder that carele&s;sne&s;s and infidelity prevail under &s;uch conduct? But as long as rulers can force away money from the people, for the &s;upport of religious teachers, it bribes them to exert all their influence in their favour; and this bribes rulers to continue in that practice; and God
<PB N="38" REF="030011_0037_0FE3BB61A60546C0">&s;ays, A gift doth blind the eyes of the wi&s;e, and per|vert the words of the righteous. Deut. xvi. 19. From whence we may learn the cau&s;e, why &s;o many wi&s;e and righteous men are en&s;nared in the&s;e ways. At the &s;ame time, if men can &s;ave their money by re|nouncing the u&s;e of force to &s;upport religious mini&s;|ters, many will u&s;e their liberty for an occa&s;ion to the fle&s;h, and as a cloak of maliciou&s;ne&s;s, which &s;erves to prejudice others again&s;t the liberty of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The churches who formed the Warren A&s;&s;ocia|tion, pre&s;ented many addre&s;&s;es to our rulers, and publi|cations to the world, again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion, and for relig|ious liberty, from their fir&s;t formation in 1767, to the clo&s;e of the war in 1783; and as long as the <HI>fear</HI> of &s;uffering from others was powerful, it moved them to unite again&s;t their oppre&s;&s;ors; but as that fear abated, the <HI>love</HI> of &s;elf and of earthly things, has in &s;ome in&s;tances prevailed again&s;t &s;olemn promi&s;es and obligations. So our Lord &s;ays, Woe unto the world becau&s;e of offences; for it mu&s;t needs be that offences come, but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh. And he requires us to give each brother two opportunities to &s;peak for him|&s;elf, before the offence is told to the church, who&s;e &s;entence is to decide the ca&s;e. Matt. xviii. 7&mdash;18. But where teachers are &s;upported by force, all are accounted offenders who refu&s;e to have fellow&s;hip with that way. And many offences will ari&s;e among churches who have no &s;uch exerci&s;e of power, which require more di&s;cretion and patience in dealing with offenders according to the laws of Chri&s;t, than mo&s;t Chri&s;tians have attained unto. And when they have crouded matters into the church, without a due regard to his laws, they want a higher power to appeal to, than a particular church of Chri&s;t. To call in advice, where the accu&s;er and accu&s;ed may be heard face to face, and &s;uitable coun&s;el be given for the church to
<PB N="39" REF="030011_0038_0FE3BD526C5FE4D0">act upon, is a practice which is warranted by &s;cripture and rea&s;on; but a power in councils above particu|lar churches, has no foundation in &s;cripture, and is an endle&s;s &s;ource of confu&s;ion among Chri&s;tians. Of this we have had much experience. When the Warren A&s;&s;ociation met at Middleborough, Sept. 7, 1784, a mini&s;ter who had cen&s;ured &s;ome of his brethren, and refu&s;ed to let them call in advice from other churches, came with a complaint again&s;t &s;ome who had gone to hear them without his con&s;ent; but he was re|proved therefor. Yet when the A&s;&s;ociation met at Wrentham, Sept. 13, 1785, he came with &s;ome que|ries which pointed to the &s;ame thing. And a man who had been excluded from another church, then came with an earne&s;t reque&s;t that the A&s;&s;ociation would interpo&s;e their influence in his favour; and becau&s;e they refu&s;ed to do it, he publi&s;hed a bitter complaint in a Bo&s;ton news-paper. When they met at Newton, Sept. 12, 1786, a complaint of a divi&s;ion in another church cau&s;ed a con&s;iderable labour, and then a vote to leave them out of the A&s;&s;ociation, which is the farthe&s;t that they have a right to go in &s;uch ca&s;es. Their meeting at Chelmsford, Sept. 11, 1787, was not interrupted with &s;uch things. Yet when they met at Sturbridge, Sept. 9, 1788, a com|plaint was brought again&s;t the majority of another church, who had withdrawn from their mini&s;ter and a part of their brethren, and the majority were left out of the A&s;&s;ociation, and the mini&s;ter with the mi|nority were recommended as the church. But as this was going too far, &s;o the effects have been very unhappy ever &s;ince. And when the A&s;&s;ociation met again at Sturbridge, Sept. 8, 1789, another mini&s;ter made hard attempts to croud a complaint again&s;t a church into it; but it was kept out, though with difficulty, and he has been &s;ince di&s;owned by all our churches. And all experience hath &s;hown, that a particular church of Chri&s;t is the highe&s;t judicature
<PB N="40" REF="030011_0039_0FE3BCE963989450">that he hath e&s;tabli&s;hed upon earth to carry his laws into execution in his name. And he &s;ays, Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the mid&s;t of them. Matt. xvii. 20. In all earthly governments, the laws are executed in the name of the &s;upreme authority of it, which cannot &s;ee but a little of what is done in their name. But the Son of God is pre&s;ent in every church, as well as through the world, by his univer&s;al knowledge and power; and if any of his churches leave their fir&s;t love, and will not repent, he removes the can|dle&s;tick out of his place. Rev. ii. 1&mdash;5.</P>
<P N="5">V. Wi&s;e mea&s;ures were now taken to the &s;outh|ward, to &s;ecure religious liberty. A general com|mittee of the Bapti&s;t churches in Virginia, pre|&s;ented an addre&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o the excellent Wa&s;hington, upon his being cho&s;en Pre&s;ident of the&s;e United States, dated Augu&s;t 8, 1789, in which they &s;aid; "When the con&s;titution fir&s;t made its appearance in Virginia, we, as a &s;ociety, had unu&s;ual &s;truggles of mind, fearing that the liberty of con&s;cience (dearer to us than property or life) was not &s;ufficiently &s;ecured. Perhaps our jealou&s;ies were heightened, on account of the u&s;age we received in Virginia, under the regal government, when mobs, bonds, fines and pri&s;ons, were our frequent repa&s;t." Pre&s;ident Wa&s;hington returned them an an&s;wer, wherein he &s;aid, "If I could have entertained the &s;lighte&s;t apprehen&s;ion that the con&s;titution framed in the convention where I had the honour to pre&s;ide, might po&s;&s;ibly endanger the religious rights of any eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;ociety, cer|tainly I would never have placed my &s;ignature to it." And he &s;aid to tho&s;e Bapti&s;ts, "While I recollect with &s;atisfaction, that the religious &s;ociety of which you are members, have been, throughout America, uniformly and almo&s;t unanimou&s;ly the firm friends of civil liberty, and the per&s;evering promoters of our glorious revolution, I cannot he&s;itate to believe, that
<PB N="41" REF="030011_0040_0FE3BD584643F930">they will be the faithful &s;upporters of a free, yet ef|ficient general government."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Leland's Virginia Chronicle, p. 47, 48.</NOTE> And the next month the Congre&s;s propo&s;ed a number of amendments to our federal con&s;titution, one of which &s;ays, "Con|gre&s;s &s;hall make no law, e&s;tabli&s;hing articles of faith, or a mode of wor&s;hip, or prohibiting the free exerci&s;e of religion, or abridging the freedom of &s;peech, or of the pre&s;s, or the right of the people peaceably to a&s;&s;emble, and to petition to the government for a redre&s;s of grievances." This was dated Sept. 23, 1789; but the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts legi&s;lature were &s;o far from adopting of it, that we cannot find any record of any debates upon it. When this State was &s;ince &s;ued, before the federal court at Philadelphia, our legi&s;lature was called together upon it, who in&s;truct|ed our members in Congre&s;s to u&s;e all their influ|ence to procure an amendment of the con&s;titution in that re&s;pect, and it was effected, and the amend|ment was readily adopted by the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts legi&s;|lature; but the amendment about liberty of con|&s;cience is kept out of &s;ight. But in vain do they think to hide their iniquity from the eternal God, who is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons, but will reward every man according to his works. And the above te&s;ti|mony in favour of the Bapti&s;ts in general, is con|firmed by experience, and by the nature of things. For where no per&s;on can be made a member of the church, without his own con&s;ent, and each one can withdraw from it when he will, all cruel oppre&s;&s;ion is excluded. And &s;uch churches are not accounta|ble for any over whom they have no power. Yet all the Bapti&s;ts in Europe and America, have often been reproached with the <HI>madne&s;s</HI> of Mun&s;ter, in 1533, where they tried to &s;upport their religion with the <HI>&s;word.</HI> Though the parliament of England revolted from the Pope the &s;ame year, and &s;et up their king as the head of the church. And all men who love

But they who are guilty of it, are commonly fal&s;e accu&s;ers of all who &s;oberly refu&s;e to have fellow&s;hip with them therein. And the prophe|cy is fulfilled, which &s;ays, I beheld another bea&s;t com|ing up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb, and he &s;pake as a dragon, and he exerci&s;eth all the power of the fir&s;t bea&s;t before him, and cau&s;|eth the earth, and them which dwell therein, to wor|&s;hip the fir&s;t bea&s;t, who&s;e deadly wound was healed. Rev. xiii. 11, 12. The two horns are, undoubtedly, the officers of church and &s;tate, uniting their influ|ence in &s;chemes of power and gain, under the name of religion and government. The &s;word of the Spirit, which is the word of God, gave the fir&s;t bea&s;t a deadly wound, when the pure doctrine of &s;alvation by grace was proclaimed in the reformation. But that doctrine, and the government of the church of Chri&s;t by his holy laws, are as much oppo&s;ed now by Prote&s;tants, as ever they were by the church of Rome. And how little do the people of New-En|gland now act according to the high opinion that others have entertained of them? For an excellent author in South-Carolina, &s;peaking of the beginning of the war in 1775, &s;ays, "It was a fortunate cir|cum&s;tance for the colonies that the royal army was po&s;ted in New-England. The people of that north|ern country have their pa&s;&s;ions more under the com|mand of rea&s;on and intere&s;t than in the &s;outhern latitudes, where a warmer &s;un excites a greater degree of ira&s;cibility. One ra&s;h offen&s;ive action, again&s;t the royal forces at that early period, though &s;ucce&s;sful, might have done great mi&s;chief to the cau&s;e of America. It would have lo&s;t them Euro|pean friends, and weakened the di&s;po&s;ition of the other colonies to a&s;&s;i&s;t them.

And he al&s;o &s;ays, "It was one of the peculiarities of the&s;e new forms of government, that all religious e&s;tabli&s;hments were aboli&s;hed."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ram&s;ay's Hi&s;tory of the American Revolution, vol.

<P N="6">VI. For in January, 1790, a book was publi&s;hed in Bo&s;ton, entitled, "The Bapti&s;m of Je&s;us Chri&s;t <HI>not</HI> to be imitated by Chri&s;tians." It was written by two mini&s;ters in the county of Worce&s;ter. Their ar|gument is, that John was a prie&s;t in the church of I&s;rael, and that when he baptized Je&s;us, he initiated him into the office of the prie&s;thood, to make atone|ment for &s;in, which none can do but the Son of God. And they &s;ay, "It will not be denied by any, that the words wa&s;hing and bapti&s;m are of like im|port. &mdash;The bapti&s;m of Chri&s;t then mu&s;t be con&s;ider|ed as the fulfilment of the law of prie&s;tly con&s;ecra|tion." Yet as Aaron and his &s;ons were to wa&s;h their hands and feet, the&s;e men &s;ay, "Is it not almo&s;t cer|tain that Chri&s;t was not plunged all over in water?"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ay of Fi&s;h and Crane, p. 8.20</NOTE> An&s;wer, Mo&s;es was to bring Aaron and his &s;ons un|to the door of the tabernacle, and to <HI>wa&s;h</HI> them with water. This was done once by Mo&s;es, at their con|&s;ecration. But Aaron and his &s;ons were to wa&s;h their own hands and feet, from time to time. Exod. xxix. 4. xxx. 19, 21. Lev. viii. 6. In the fir&s;t ca&s;e there is no mention of hands and feet. Mo&s;es wa&s;h|ed them all over. But if wa&s;hing their hands and feet was bapti&s;m, then Aaron and his &s;ons were <HI>ana|bapti&s;ts.</HI> Yea, and they baptized them&s;elves too, which is oppo&s;ite to all ideas of go&s;pel bapti&s;m.

<PB N="44" REF="030011_0043_0FE3BCF200755710">Je&s;us as a prie&s;t in the Hebrew church. For it is evident that our Lord &s;prang out of Judah, of which tribe Mo&s;es &s;pake nothing concerning prie&s;t|hood. And it is yet far more evident; for that after the &s;imilitude of Melchizedek there ari&s;eth another prie&s;t, who is made, not after the law of a <HI>carnal</HI> com|mandment, but after the power of an <HI>endle&s;s life.</HI> Yea, he is of an <HI>order</HI> above Abraham; and the prie&s;thood of Aaron is <HI>di&s;annulled.</HI> Heb. vii. 5&mdash;19.

Rev. v. 9, 10. So Peter &s;ays to all who are born again, Ye are a cho&s;en generation, a <HI>royal prie&s;thood,</HI> an holy nation, a peculiar people. 1 Pet. ii. 9. By the death of Chri&s;t he di&s;annulled all claims to power by nat|ural birth, and united the great offices of prie&s;ts and kings in his church, in tho&s;e who are born of the Spirit. Je&s;us is the only law-giver for his church, and his children are the only executors thereof in his name. And God &s;ays, Beware le&s;t any man &s;poil you through philo&s;ophy and vain <HI>deceit,</HI> after the tra|dition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Chri&s;t. For in him dwelleth all the fulne&s;s of the Godhead bodily; and ye are <HI>complete</HI> in him, who is the HEAD of all principality and power.

Col. ii. 8&mdash;12. Yet philo&s;ophy and vain deceit hath prevailed &s;o long, that it is now denied that Chri&s;tians &s;hould imitate the bapti&s;m of Chri&s;t, becau&s;e the ceremonial law was
<PB N="45" REF="030011_0044_0FE3BD6175947610">not aboli&s;hed until his death. But the &s;ame men hold infant bapti&s;m from the covenant of circumci&s;ion, which was the foundation of the national church of I&s;rael. Yea, Mr. Fi&s;h, one of the authors of this book, publi&s;hed one before, in 1772, which he called <HI>Japheth dwelling in the tents of Shem,</HI> from Gen. ix. 27; in which he went back ten generations before Abraham, for a warrant for infant bapti&s;m. And their e&s;&s;ay now, to prove that the bapti&s;m of Chri&s;t is not to be imitated by Chri&s;tians, hath been &s;o plea&s;|ing to the world, that it hath pa&s;&s;ed three editions.</P>
<P N="7">VII. And the folly of men in other re&s;pects is daily expo&s;ed. For the law in Connecticut, called, "An act for &s;ecuring the rights of con&s;cience in mat|ters of religion, to Chri&s;tians of every denomination in this State," proved to be &s;o ineffectual to their purpo&s;e, that they made an addition thereto in May, 1791. By this addition no certificate could be <HI>legal,</HI> until it was approbated by two ju&s;tices of the peace, or only by one if there was no more in the town where the di&s;&s;enter lived. Thus the civil authority in the uppermo&s;t religious party in their State, were to judge the con&s;ciences of all men who di&s;&s;ented from their wor&s;hip. And when they had done it, the act &s;ays, "Which certificate, upon being lodged with the clerk of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;ociety in which &s;uch di&s;&s;enter dwells, &s;hall thereafter, &s;o long as he &s;hall attend the public wor&s;hip of the church or congre|gation to which he has joined him&s;elf, and &s;hall con|tinue to pay &s;uch his proportion, towards the &s;up|port of the public wor&s;hip and mini&s;try thereof, ex|empt him from all civil obligation to the &s;ociety from which he di&s;&s;ents, excepting taxes granted before the time &s;uch certificate is lodged with the clerk of &s;aid &s;ociety as afore&s;aid." And this is a plain imitation of the Briti&s;h parliament, who re&s;olved in 1775, that they would not tax any colony in America, who &s;hould rai&s;e as much money among them&s;elves for
<PB N="46" REF="030011_0045_0FE3BCF7B2F9BE60">the &s;upport of government, as the parliament judged that they ought to, as long as they did &s;o, and no longer. But as God hath delivered us from that tyranny, how can any &s;ubmit to a like tyranny over the con&s;ciences of men? For a freehold rated at fifty &s;hillings, or forty pounds in the common li&s;t, gives every inhabitant in Connecticut the power of voting for their legi&s;lature, and of being elected into it. And all the privilege that their churches have, in the choice and &s;upport of their mini&s;ters, is that com|municants may vote with the re&s;t of the congregation in the&s;e affairs, if they have not &s;o much e&s;tate as is required of voters for rulers, and are twenty-one years of age. But a great part of their mini&s;ters and churches readily receive per&s;ons into their commu|nion, without any evidence of their being born again. And for one party of &s;uch men to a&s;&s;ume the power of judging the con&s;ciences of all who di&s;&s;ented from their wor&s;hip, alarmed many in all parts of the gov|ernment, and they drew up a remon&s;trance and pe|tition, in which they &s;aid, "We cannot find that Je&s;us Chri&s;t or his apo&s;tles ever gave orders to civil rulers to e&s;tabli&s;h the Chri&s;tian religion at large, much le&s;s one di&s;tingui&s;hed denomination, who profe&s;s it, and u&s;e the civil law to &s;upport its doctrines, forms or preachers; or that the &s;ubjects of Chri&s;t's kingdom (which is not of this world) &s;hould acknowledge any ruler but Chri&s;t alone, in religious concerns. And we long to &s;ee religion left entirely in the hands of Chri&s;t, to be governed alone by his laws; that the grand controver&s;y may be decided, whether religion is &s;uch an adjective that it cannot &s;tand of it&s;elf, or &s;o important that it will &s;upport it&s;elf upon its own merits, and all who tru&s;t in it." This produced a repeal of &s;aid law, in October, 1791; though they then made another, to allow every man to give in his own certificate, if he di&s;&s;ented from the ruling &s;ect.</P>

VIII. The uppermo&s;t party among Chri&s;tians have ever had the command of all colleges, to educate religious teachers, as well as other men of &s;uperior learning, until very lately. Even in 1780, no min|i&s;ters but <HI>Congregational</HI> mini&s;ters were allowed to be over&s;eers of the univer&s;ity at Cambridge, by the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts con&s;titution of government. And great &s;ums have been given to that univer&s;ity by the government, from time to time, ever &s;ince it began in 1638. But as Providence and Rhode-I&s;land colony was planted by men who were bani&s;hed from the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, becau&s;e they con&s;cientiou&s;ly di&s;&s;ented from the u&s;e of force in religious affairs, and that colony &s;uffered amazingly from neighbour colonies for more than an hundred years, the people therein have grown up with great prejudices again&s;t colleges, and again&s;t obeying the laws of Chri&s;t for the &s;up|port of his mini&s;ters. But as a mini&s;ter died this year, who hath done much towards removing tho&s;e prejudices, I &s;hall give a conci&s;e account of the affair. Mr. I&s;aac Eaton, who was pa&s;tor of the Bapti&s;t church at Hopewell in New-Jer&s;ey, from 1748 to 1772, &s;et up a &s;chool for the education of youth for the mini&s;try, as well as for other callings, in 1756, and kept it for eleven years. One of his &s;cholars was Mr. James Manning, who went from his &s;chool to the college at Princeton, where he took his fir&s;t degree in September, 1762. And as the Philadelphia A&s;&s;ociation were for erecting a college in Rhode-I&s;land government, they fixed their eyes upon him as a proper leader in the affair. He therefore called in at Newport, on his voyage to Halifax, in July, 1763, and propo&s;ed the matter to a number of Bap|ti&s;t gentlemen, who readily concurred therewith; and as they had a high opinion of a learned Congre|gational mini&s;ter among them, they de&s;ired him to make a draught of a charter for a college in that gov|ernment, It was propo&s;ed to take in &s;ome mem|bers
<PB N="48" REF="030011_0047_0FE3BCFBE79E6CF0">of the &s;everal denominations among them, but that the Bapti&s;ts &s;hould always be the majority of the corporation. He drew a charter which appeared to be upon this plan, and it was introduced into their legi&s;lature; but a Bapti&s;t gentleman di&s;cerned that there was a door left open for the Congregational denomination to become the majority hereafter. Therefore the charter was not then pa&s;&s;ed into a law; and when their legi&s;lature met again, the char|ter was not to be found. When this was heard of at Philadelphia, two gentlemen were &s;ent from thence, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted in drawing a new charter, which was e&s;tabli&s;hed by the legi&s;lature of Rhode-I&s;land in February, 1764; and Mr. Manning removed to Warren in the &s;ummer following, to preach to a Bapti&s;t church newly formed there, and to begin the &s;chool.</P>
<P N="9">IX. In September, 1765, he was cho&s;en pre&s;ident of the college, and diligently attended to the duties thereof, until &s;even young gentlemen took their fir&s;t degree there, September 7, 1769. One of them was afterwards a member of Congre&s;s, and then a general in the American army, and la&s;tly a judge of the courts in our we&s;tern territory, where he died. Three of them are now u&s;eful Bapti&s;t mini&s;ters. In February, 1770, the corporation concluded to re|move the college to Providence, where a large brick hou&s;e was erected for the purpo&s;e, entirely by per&s;onal genero&s;ity; and education was well carried on there, until the Briti&s;h troops came to Newport in December, 1776, and our army came to Providence to oppo&s;e them, and u&s;ed the college edifice as a barrack. After the&s;e ob&s;truc|tions were removed, pre&s;ident Manning engaged again in the work of education for a little while, and then &s;aid edifice was &s;eized, by the order of a coun|cil of war, for a French ho&s;pital, on Lord's day, June 25, 1780, while Dr. Manning was gone to
<PB N="49" REF="030011_0048_0FE3BD6A611515F0">preach in town, and they held it till May 27, 1782. And although no government upon earth ever gave any thing towards that building, yet no recompen&s;e has ever been obtained for the great damages which were done to it by government.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though there is &s;ome hope of it &s;oon from Congre&s;s.</NOTE> However, pre&s;i|dent Manning, being encouraged by the friends of the college, heartily engaged again in his public work, and learning flouri&s;hed under his admini&s;tra|tions, and the Bapti&s;t church in Providence enjoyed many ble&s;&s;ings under his mini&s;try, until he was &s;ud|denly called out of our world, July 29, 1791, in the 53d year of his age. He was &s;o well e&s;teemed in the government, that he was elected a delegate to Con|gre&s;s in the &s;pring of 1786, which office he accepted for &s;ix months, in hopes of obtaining a grant from thence to indemnify the college at Providence. But though he was highly e&s;teemed in that honourable body, yet it was then out of their power to do ju&s;tice in this ca&s;e, as well as many others. Neither could pre&s;ident Manning obtain the whole of his &s;alary for many years, which was to be paid out of the intere&s;t of money that was collected el&s;ewhere, and was lent to Rhode-I&s;land government. His per&s;everance, therefore, in the mid&s;t of &s;o many difficulties, and his ri&s;ing above them all in faithfulne&s;s and kindne&s;s, will endear his memory to the late&s;t po&s;terity. And the&s;e things demon&s;trate to all men, that the princi|ples of believers' bapti&s;m, and of equal liberty of con|&s;cience, are more friendly to true learning and knowledge, than any party &s;chemes of religion ever were, or ever can be. For all loving of &s;elf above God and our neighbours, though covered with a ma&s;k of religion or government, can never make the &s;ubjects of it willing to have their real character &s;een.</P>
<P N="10">X. And how is this love of &s;elf now expo&s;ed in our country? For the fir&s;t Congre&s;s upon our new con&s;titution met in March, 1789, and made laws
<PB N="50" REF="030011_0049_0FE3BD6FF2E08170">to regulate the trade of America, which revived public credit, and the merchandi&s;e of this country was carried round the world. Al&s;o the creditors of government were encouraged to bring in their notes to the loan offices that were appointed in each State, where the intere&s;t of &s;aid notes was ca&s;t up to the clo&s;e of 1791; after which new notes were given out, of three denominations. The fir&s;t were to carry the intere&s;t which was formerly promi&s;ed, the &s;econd but half &s;o much, and the third were to pay no intere&s;t at all for ten years. But who would tru&s;t any &s;ingle man in the world, if he &s;hould act in this manner? Surely no man upon earth could obtain credit and e&s;teem in &s;uch a way. And our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who requires the go&s;pel mini&s;try to be committed to <HI>faithful men,</HI> &s;ays, If we be dead with him, we &s;hall al&s;o live with him; if we &s;uffer, we &s;hall al&s;o reign with him: if we deny him, he al&s;o will deny us: if we believe not, yet he <HI>abideth faithful; he cannot deny him&s;elf.</HI> 2 Tim. ii. 2&mdash;13. This is the only line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion for his mini&s;ters. But deceitful men in every &s;tation imagine that the &s;ecurity of a whole government is &s;o much &s;tronger than the promi&s;es of individuals, that they &s;ay, Ca&s;t in thy lot among us, let us all have one pur&s;e.&mdash;Their feet run to evil, and make ha&s;te to &s;hed <HI>blood.</HI> This God &s;ays of <HI>all the world.</HI> Prov. i. 14, 16. Rom. iii. 15, 19. How vain then are all the arguments which are advanced again&s;t the univer&s;al depravity of man|kind? Yea, or again&s;t the power of God in chang|ing the heart, who &s;ays, Turn ye at my reproof; behold I will pour out my <HI>Spirit</HI> unto you, and will make known my <HI>words</HI> unto you? But all men who <HI>hate knowledge,</HI> and will not choo&s;e the <HI>fear</HI> of the Lord in this life, will cry in vain for mercy, when de&s;truction cometh as a whirlwind. Prov. i. 23&mdash;29. The &s;everal &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nding &s;y&s;tems e&s;tabli&s;hed by govern|ment, as well as &s;upporting religious teachers by com|pul&s;ion,

I&s;aiah xxxiii. 13&mdash;15. This is the only way of &s;afety and happine&s;s. But how oppo&s;ite hereto were the following actions?</P>
<P N="11">XI. A Bapti&s;t church was formed in Barn&s;table in June, 1771, and when they had given in certificates to the ruling &s;ect, they were generally exempted from taxes to their mini&s;ters for ten years. But a fre&s;h re|vival of religion came on among them in the begin|ning of 1781, and increa&s;ed their church and &s;oci|ety, until they built a convenient meeting-hou&s;e, and then ordained a pa&s;tor, December 4, 1788. He had preached to them for four years before he was or|dained, yet in that time, with three years after, above an hundred and fifty dollars were extorted from that &s;ociety, for the Congregational mini&s;ters of the fir&s;t pari&s;hes in Barn&s;table and Yarmouth. In January, 1790, a collector in Barn&s;table took away a good hor&s;e from one of the committee of that Bapti&s;t &s;oci|ety, for a mini&s;terial tax of le&s;s than two dollars; and though he offered to return a &s;mall part of the value of the hor&s;e, yet the Bapti&s;t gentleman refu&s;ed to receive it, and &s;o to have fellow&s;hip with their works of darkne&s;s. But tho&s;e cruel oppre&s;&s;ions were pur&s;ued, until the committee of the Warren A&s;&s;ocia|tion met at Bo&s;ton, January 24, 1791, and wrote to the officers of tho&s;e two pari&s;hes in &s;uch a manner, that they have generally refrained from taxing the
<PB N="52" REF="030011_0051_0FE3BD74D2782E10">Bapti&s;ts to Congregational mini&s;ters &s;ince, though they have not returned the money which they had before unju&s;tly taken from them. The we&s;t pari&s;h in Barn&s;table, and many others through the country, have not made di&s;tre&s;s upon the Bapti&s;ts for the &s;upport of pari&s;h mini&s;ters, as the&s;e have done. And our ru|lers give Bapti&s;t mini&s;ters the &s;ame power to marry people, and to be exempted from civil taxes, that they do to other mini&s;ters. But they have not yet gone &s;o far as a king of Per&s;ia did, who gave liberally for the hou&s;e of God out of his own trea&s;ures, and exempted the mini&s;ters of the &s;anctuary from civil taxes, without impo&s;ing any mini&s;terial tax upon the people. Ezra vii. 11&mdash;24. And we have no evi|dence that God ever allowed any rulers in I&s;rael to u&s;e any &s;ecular force for the &s;upport of his prie&s;ts in their church; but when two prie&s;ts &s;ent their &s;erv|ants to the people with this language, Thou &s;halt give it now; and if not, I will take it by <HI>force,</HI> they were both &s;lain in one day, and their father's neck was broke. For God had &s;aid, Them that honour me, I will honour, and they that de&s;pi&s;e me &s;hall be lightly e&s;teemed. 1 Sam. ii. 16, 30. iv. 11, 18. And how far are teachers from honouring our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, if they refu&s;e to be content with all the good things that his laws and influence will give them!</P>
<P N="12">XII. Impri&s;onments and &s;poiling of goods, for the &s;upport of Congregational mini&s;ters in Rehoboth, for thirty years, had brought that &s;ect to be the minor part of the inhabitants of the town; therefore they obtained liberty to &s;ell their mini&s;terial lands, and an act of our legi&s;lature in 1762, to incorporate the committee who &s;hould be annually elected in each pari&s;h, to manage that fund of money, and what &s;hould be added to it by &s;ub&s;cription, &s;o that the in|tere&s;t thereof might &s;upport their mini&s;ters. And it was &s;uppo&s;ed that as long as this act continued in force, they had no right to tax all the inhabitants to
<PB N="53" REF="030011_0052_0FE3BDDECEEC4830">them, as they had before done. And this appeared the more nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e Mr. Samuel Peck was ordained the pa&s;tor of a Congregational church in Rehoboth, October 8, 1751, who refu&s;ed to have any fellow&s;hip with tho&s;e who u&s;ed tax and compul|&s;ion in that affair; and he mini&s;tered to them until he died, November 26, 1788, Aet. 82. But the &s;ink|ing of our public credit, and other means, brought their fund of money in the fir&s;t pari&s;h in Rehoboth down to le&s;s than &s;ix hundred pounds; and as Mr. John Ellis was in&s;talled their mini&s;ter in March, 1785, with a promi&s;e of a &s;alary of an hundred pounds a year, they ventured to tax all the inhabitants to pay it, though he was not elected by a third part of them. And as they paid but little more than the &s;alary of one year in five, he &s;ued the pari&s;h for the re&s;t, and recovered judgment again&s;t them in March, 1791. But they appealed to the &s;uperior court in October following; and they called a pari&s;h meeting in Sep|tember, and offered the u&s;e of their meeting-hou&s;e, and of their fund of money to Mr. Ellis's party, as long as he continued their mini&s;ter, if they would pay off that debt, and &s;upport him, without taxing any who did not choo&s;e him; and adjourned for three weeks. But as this offer was not accepted at their next meeting, fifty voters again&s;t fourteen voted to &s;hut him out of their meeting-hou&s;e, and cho&s;e a &s;pecial committee to get Bapti&s;t mini&s;ters to preach therein. And as they had not got any Bapti&s;t min|i&s;ter to preach in it the fir&s;t Lord's day after he was &s;hut out, he came and demanded it to be opened be|fore two ju&s;tices of the peace; and becau&s;e it was not opened, they publi&s;hed an account of it in the Prov|idence news-papers, and called the men <HI>in&s;urgents</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A name given to tho&s;e who re&s;i&s;ted our courts in 1786.</NOTE> who &s;hut him out. The next Lord's day, while a Bapti&s;t mini&s;ter was in the pulpit, he came and in|terrupted the public wor&s;hip of God; but he was
<PB N="54" REF="030011_0053_0FE3BD7855948940">brought before a ju&s;tice of peace therefor, and bound to his good behaviour till the next March court, and Bapti&s;t mini&s;ters preached in &s;aid hou&s;e all that time. In March he, with difficulty, obtained a relea&s;e from tho&s;e bonds, though he could not recover his former place of wor&s;hip. Therefore his party applied to our legi&s;lature in June, 1792, and obtained a repeal of the act of 1762, which inve&s;ted their pari&s;h commit|tee with power to manage their fund of money, and an act to incorporate his party as the Congregational &s;ociety in the fir&s;t precinct in Rehoboth. But as they did not obtain the meeting-hou&s;e nor fund of money thereby, they called a &s;pecial court for that purpo&s;e, Augu&s;t 30, 1792; yet judgment was th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> given again&s;t them, which they were &s;o far from yield|ing to, that they ru&s;hed into the meeting-hou&s;e the next Lord's day, and &s;ome of them continued in it night and day for a fortnight; though others al&s;o &s;tayed there and prevented their getting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e. Afterwards Ellis's party called another &s;pecial court, who gave them po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;aid hou&s;e.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. Now can any man believe, that &s;uch pro|ceedings as the&s;e have any tendency to promote piety, religion or morality? Yea, are they not as contrary thereto as darkne&s;s is to light? And the&s;e are the natural effects of &s;upporting religious mini&s;ters by force. Neither would that little party at Rehoboth have been able to go &s;o far as they have done, if rulers and mini&s;ters in general had not viewed it as their own cau&s;e. For if one congregation can &s;hut their mini&s;ter out of their meeting-hou&s;e when they think proper, another may al&s;o, and &s;upporting wor|&s;hip by force will be excluded from our land. And though many have reflected on the Bapti&s;ts, becau&s;e that &s;ociety in Rehoboth called them in to a&s;&s;i&s;t in their wor&s;hip, and to exclude oppre&s;&s;ors; yet the fir&s;t pari&s;hes in Roche&s;ter and Wrentham have &s;hut their mini&s;ters al&s;o out of their meeting-hou&s;es, without
<PB N="55" REF="030011_0054_0FE3BDE3ABC96960">any concern with the Bapti&s;ts therein. And it daily appears, that the ruling party in our land, as well as through the world, are trying to gra&s;p the honours and profits of religion to them&s;elves, while they de|ny the <HI>power of godline&s;s.</HI> And the doctrines of grace, and the order of the fir&s;t churches in New-England, are trampled upon through the country. Of this we have a notable in&s;tance in the town of Taunton, the capital of Bri&s;tol county. As a number of lead|ing men in that town di&s;liked the preaching of their mini&s;ter, they informed the pari&s;h that they had no right to vote him any &s;alary, becau&s;e they were the minor part of the inhabitants of the town; and, after &s;everal meetings, a council was called, and he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, near the clo&s;e of 1790. After which they obtained an incorporation as the Congregational &s;ociety in Taunton, with power to &s;ettle and &s;upport mini&s;ters by tax and compul&s;ion; only if any man therein de&s;ired to withdraw from them, he might go to their clerk at the end of the year, and get his name out of the li&s;t, and be free from them for the future. But any number of men can form a &s;tronger &s;ociety than this, without putting our government to &s;uch va&s;t co&s;ts as have been laid upon us in &s;uch affairs. And it &s;oon appeared, that &s;aid &s;ociety and the fir&s;t Congregational church in Taunton could not agree in calling another mini&s;ter; therefore another church was formed, in open <HI>&s;eparation</HI> from the fir&s;t church in Taunton, and they called a mini&s;ter who was &s;o di&s;agreeable to the fir&s;t church, that they went and built another meeting-hou&s;e, and called another min|i&s;ter to preach to them. But the new party &s;ent for two mini&s;ters out of Bo&s;ton, and obtained ten more from various parts of the country, to give a &s;anction to their proceedings. And in a Bo&s;ton paper of May 25. 1792, it was &s;aid, "Wedne&s;day, the 16th in&s;tant, the Rev.

Now the principles of repentance from dead works, of faith in the Son of God, of re&s;urrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment, were never known by men but by pure revelation from God; and the &s;ame is true of regeneration, and of ju&s;tification by our &s;ins being laid upon Chri&s;t our &s;acrifice.

But the holding to an external laying on of hands upon officers, as a foundation point in mini&s;terial authority, hath made them lords over God's heritage, in every age, and in every country where the Chri&s;tian name hath been known. And holding to the laying on of hands upon every member, after bapti&s;m, hath cau&s;ed great divi&s;ions among the Bapti&s;ts, which &s;hould put all upon examination of this point. Laying on of hands upon officers in ordination, is no more than a &s;olemn &s;wearing of them to be faithful in their work, and civil rulers are al&s;o inducted into their offices by an oath, after the people have given them their pow|er, which they can take away again at appointed times. And this was the original plan of the Con|gregational churches in New-England; only none were allowed to give mini&s;ters their power, but tho&s;e who were judged to be real Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. The fir&s;t church in Dorche&s;ter, with Mr. Wareham their mini&s;ter, removed up to Wind&s;or, and began the colony of Connecticut, in 1635, in which year Mr. Richard Mather came over to Dor|che&s;ter. And on April 11, 1636, a meeting was held there for the purpo&s;e of gathering a new church; but it was not then done, becau&s;e the rulers and mini&s;ters pre&s;ent were not &s;atisfied with the experi|ences of the mo&s;t of the per&s;ons who were to be of the church. "Mo&s;t of them had burdened their comfort of &s;alvation upon un&s;ound grounds, viz. Some upon dreams and ravi&s;hes of &s;pirit by fits; others upon the reformation of their lives; others upon duties and performances, &amp;c. wherein they di&s;covered three &s;pecial errors. 1. That they had not come to hate &s;in becau&s;e it was filthy, but only left it becau&s;e it was hurtful. 2. That by rea&s;on of
<PB N="60" REF="030011_0059_0FE3BD87C502B700">this they had never truly clo&s;ed with Chri&s;t (or rather Chri&s;t with them) but had made u&s;e of him only to help the imperfection of their &s;anctification and du|ties, and not made him their &s;anctification, wi&s;dom, &amp;c. 3. They expected to believe by &s;ome power of their own, and not only and wholly from Chri&s;t." And in 1639, their legi&s;lature puni&s;hed a mini&s;ter and &s;ome people at Weymouth &s;everely, for attempt|ing to gather a church there, in which "all baptized ones might communicate without any farther trial of them."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Winthrop's Journal, p. 98, 171.</NOTE> This account was given by governor Winthrop, one of the greate&s;t and be&s;t men then in New-England. And as no men had a vote in the choice of mini&s;ters but communicants in their church|es, &s;o they held the power of ordination to be in each church. Mr. Cotton &s;aid, "The power of the min|i&s;terial calling is derived chiefly from Chri&s;t, fur|ni&s;hing his &s;ervants with gifts fit for the calling; and nextly from the church (or congregation) who, ob|&s;erving &s;uch whom the Lord hath gifted, do elect and call them forth to come and help them." Again he &s;ays, "Though it be our manner (and as we believe according to the word) that every church choo&s;eth and calleth their own mini&s;ters, and or|daineth them by the pre&s;bytery of the &s;ame church; yet if the pre&s;bytery of other churches commend a mini&s;ter to a vacant church, and upon the accept|ance of the church, if the pre&s;byters of tho&s;e churches do ordain him, with the con&s;ent of the church, we do not profe&s;s that this is no calling of Chri&s;t, or that the&s;e are no mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">An&s;wer to Williams, part &s;econd, 1647, p. 82, 131.</NOTE> And the next year they &s;aid in the Cambridge platform, "In &s;uch churches where there are elders, impo&s;ition of hands in ordination is to be performed by tho&s;e elders. In &s;uch churches where there are no elders, impo&s;i|tion of hands may be performed by &s;ome of the

They al&s;o &s;ay, "In ca&s;e an elder offend incorrigibly, the matter &s;o requiring, as the church had power to call him to office, &s;o they have power according to order (the council of other churches, where it may be had, directing thereto) to remove him from his office."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Platform, chapters ix, x.</NOTE> Now it is a known rule in grammar, that though a parenthe&s;is is u&s;eful in its place, yet the &s;en&s;e is complete without it. But in our day, mo&s;t of tho&s;e who are called Con|gregational mini&s;ters, deny the church's power to ordain or di&s;mi&s;s them, unle&s;s a mutual council di|rect thereto. Thus they have gone off from the fir&s;t principles of Congregational churches, while they hold the name for worldly ends. But Mr. William Hubbard, in his manu&s;cript hi&s;tory, written in 1680, &s;ays, "There is no juri&s;diction, to which as &s;uch particular churches are or ought to be &s;ubject (be it placed in cla&s;&s;es or &s;ynod) by way of authori|tative cen&s;ure, nor any church power, extrin&s;ical to the &s;aid churches, which they ought to have depend|ence upon any other &s;ort of men for the exerci&s;e of." And Mr. Jonathan Mitchel of Cambridge had before &s;aid, "The over enlarging of full commu|nion, or admi&s;&s;ion of per&s;ons thereto, upon &s;light qualifications, without in&s;i&s;ting upon the practical and &s;piritual part of religion, will not only lo&s;e the power of godline&s;s, but in a little time bring in pro|fanene&s;s, and ruin the churches, the&s;e two ways. 1. Election of mini&s;ters will &s;oon be carried by a formal loo&s;er &s;ort. 2. The exerci&s;e of di&s;cipline will by this means be rendered impo&s;&s;ible.

It is not &s;etting down good rules and directions, that will &s;alve it; for the &s;pecification of government is from men, not from laws. Let nev|er &s;o good a form of government be agreed upon, it will &s;oon degenerate, if the in&s;truments who man|age it be not good."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dedication of Mitchel's Life, p. 17, 18.</NOTE> Mr. Mitchel died in 1668, when he had no idea of their admitting any men to a governing vote for pa&s;tors of churches, but com|municants therein; and he gave the&s;e weighty rea|&s;ons again&s;t receiving any to communion without good evidence of their being godly per&s;ons; and Dr. Increa&s;e Mather dedicated the&s;e things to the college at Cambridge in 1697, of which he was then pre&s;ident. And how can any men rea&s;onably com|plain of the Bapti&s;ts for their holding fa&s;t the good principles of our fathers, and renouncing their mi&s;|takes? E&s;pecially the laying of bands upon children before they could choo&s;e for them&s;elves, and forcing all to &s;upport &s;uch wor&s;hip? Had it not been for the&s;e two evils, the characters of the fathers of New-England would out&s;hine almo&s;t any men who have lived in latter ages. Indeed the fathers of Plymouth colony renounced all the u&s;e of force to &s;upport their mini&s;ters.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">I. HAVING de&s;cribed the fir&s;t principles of Con|gregational churches, let us &s;ee how they are now held by eminent men. A book was publi&s;hed in Bo&s;|ton in the beginning of 1793, which hath had a mo&s;t rapid &s;ale, wherein are the following things. The author &s;ays, "The apo&s;tles, when they fir&s;t began to admini&s;ter Chri&s;tian bapti&s;m, and form a church, baptized none but &s;uch who <HI>gladly received the word.</HI> Acts ii. 41. When the eunuch de&s;ired to be bap|tized, Philip &s;aid, <HI>If thou believe&s;t with all thine heart, thou maye&s;t.</HI> Acts viii. 37. This implies that he was not qualified for bapti&s;m, or a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">it &s;ubject of that ordi|nance, unle&s;s he were a true believer in Chri&s;t; and that he could not baptize him, unle&s;s he profe&s;&s;ed and appeared to be &s;uch a believer."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Sy&s;tem of Doctrines, contained in divine revelation, explained and defended. By Samuel Hopkins, D. D. Pa&s;tor of the fir&s;t Congregational church in Newport. Vol. II. p. 306.</NOTE> But in order to find a warrant for infant bapti&s;m, he goes back to the covenant of circumci&s;ion which God made with
<PB N="64" REF="030011_0063_0FE3BD8AF2DCF348">Abraham, and holds that it never was repealed. And, after much labour to prove this point, he &s;ays, "They who are expecting and demanding, that Chri&s;t or his apo&s;tles &s;hould expre&s;sly renew and enjoin on Chri&s;tians, the appointment and command of God, to apply to the infants of believers the initiating &s;eal of the covenant, in order to warrant men to do it; refu&s;ing to acquie&s;ce in the deci&s;ion of this point, which God had already made; <HI>if the argument above be conclu&s;ive,</HI> are imitating Balaam, who did not re&s;t &s;atisfied with the deci&s;ion which God had once made, re&s;pecting his going to cur&s;e I&s;rael, but expected and required that God &s;hould &s;peak again, if he did really forbid his doing it."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 318, margin.</NOTE> The&s;e are the words of a min|i&s;ter who hath made &s;uch additions to Calvini&s;m that his plan is called Hopkintoniani&s;m through America. And <HI>if his argument is conclu&s;ive,</HI> the Bapti&s;ts are &s;ome of the wor&s;t men upon earth, as Balaam was &s;uch an one. But if he is entirely mi&s;taken, and God hath di&s;annulled the national covenant which he made with Abraham, it is very hurtful for any to hold the con|trary. It is therefore of great importance for all to have right ideas of this &s;ubject. And the following con&s;iderations are offered for that end.</P>
<P N="2">II. Fir&s;t, Abraham had no right to circumci&s;e any &s;tranger, until he had bought him as a <HI>&s;ervant</HI> for <HI>money.</HI> Gen. xvii. 12, 13. But God &s;ays to his chil|dren, Ye are bought with a <HI>price,</HI> be not ye the <HI>&s;erv|ants</HI> of men. 1 Cor. vii. 23. And he &s;ays to his min|i&s;ters, Feed the church of God, which he hath <HI>pur|cha&s;ed</HI> with his own <HI>blood.</HI> Acts xx. 28. He al&s;o &s;ays, Ye have &s;old your&s;elves for nought, and ye &s;hall be redeemed without <HI>money.</HI> And this is the <HI>go&s;pel of peace.</HI> I&s;aiah lii. 3, 7. Rom. x. 15. Thus do the apo&s;tles explain the prophets. Secondly, The chil|dren of I&s;rael had no right to receive &s;trangers into the church by hou&s;eholds, until <HI>the day</HI> in which they
<PB N="65" REF="030011_0064_0FE3BDFB9DF58288">came out of Egypt, when the pa&s;&s;over was in&s;tituted. And then God &s;aid, Every man's &s;ervant that is bought for money, when thou ha&s;t circumci&s;ed him, then &s;hall he eat thereof. Exod. xii. 44&mdash;48. Circumci&s;ion and the pa&s;&s;over were as binding upon &s;ervants as children; and both ordinances pointed to the <HI>blood</HI> of Chri&s;t, which he was to &s;hed for his people. And, in reference to that, God &s;aid, Behold, the days come, &s;aith the Lord, that I will make a <HI>new covenant</HI> with the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, and with the hou&s;e of Judah; <HI>not according</HI> to the covenant that I made with their fathers in <HI>the day</HI> that I took them by the hand, to bring them out of the land of Egypt. Jer. xxxi. 31, 32. And an in&s;pired apo&s;tle &s;ays, In that he &s;aith, A <HI>new</HI> covenant, he hath made the fir&s;t <HI>old.</HI> Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to van|i&s;h away. He taketh away the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> that he may e&s;tab|li&s;h the <HI>&s;econd.</HI> Heb. viii. 7&mdash;13. x. 9. And can old and new, fir&s;t and &s;econd, mean but one cove|nant? Surely no. Thirdly, <HI>Circumci&s;ion</HI> is the name which God gave to his covenant with Abraham. Acts vii. 8. And though Jews and Mahometans are &s;till zealous for it, yet all Chri&s;tians allow that cir|cumci&s;ion is repealed. But after the apo&s;tolic age, men took away the name which God gave to that covenant, and added the name <HI>grace</HI> to it; and they held that <HI>dominion is founded in grace.</HI> And from thence the nations have made <HI>merchandi&s;e</HI> of all the vanities of time, and of <HI>&s;laves and &s;ouls of men.</HI> But the <HI>plagues</HI> of Babylon will come upon all men who <HI>add</HI> to the word of God, and take away from the <HI>words</HI> of his book, if they refu&s;e to come out of that practice. Rev. xviii. 4&mdash;13. xxii. 18, 19. And there is not a word in all the bible for bringing any child to bapti&s;m without his own profe&s;&s;ion of faith in Chri&s;t, nor for forcing any man to &s;upport any religious mini&s;ter; and all national churches are built upon the&s;e two &s;uper&s;titions. Fourthly, Circumci|&s;ion
<PB N="66" REF="030011_0065_0FE3BD907B4A8B08">was the &s;hedding of <HI>human blood;</HI> and when Abraham received it, it was a <HI>&s;eal</HI> of the righteou&s;|ne&s;s of the faith which he before had in Chri&s;t, in whom believers are <HI>ju&s;tified by his blood.</HI> Rom. iv. 11, 23. v. 9. Gal. iii. 16. Gen. xv. 6. xvii. 24. It was a <HI>&s;eal</HI> to him; but neither circumci&s;ion nor bapti&s;m are ever called &s;eals to any other per&s;on in all the bible. But God &s;ays to true be|lievers in Chri&s;t, In whom al&s;o after that ye be|lieved, ye were <HI>&s;ealed</HI> with that Holy Spirit of prom|i&s;e. And he al&s;o &s;ays, Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are <HI>&s;ealed</HI> unto the day of redemp|tion. Eph. i. 13. iv. 30. After believing in Chri&s;t, the Holy Spirit &s;eals the merits of his death, and the promi&s;es of his grace to the &s;oul. And all believers from the beginning, looked through the <HI>bloody</HI> ordi|nances which God appointed, to the <HI>blood</HI> of Chri&s;t for ju&s;tification. And after the bea&s;t aro&s;e out of the bottomle&s;s pit, God &s;aid, All that dwell upon the earth &s;hall wor&s;hip him, who&s;e names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb <HI>&s;lain</HI> from the foun|dation of the world. Rev. xiii. 8. <HI>Force and cruelty</HI> is the general character of the bea&s;t; but Je&s;us, who is the root and offspring of <HI>David,</HI> will cau&s;e all <HI>evil bea&s;ts</HI> to cea&s;e out of the land. Ezek. xxxiv. 4&mdash;25. Rev. xxii. 16.

<P N="3">III. Let us now inquire what was the error of Ba|laam? When God took the nation of I&s;rael to be his church, he was an <HI>hu&s;band</HI> unto them. Jer. xxxi. 32.

Rev. ii. 14. Now, &s;ince covetou&s;ne&s;s and luxury are idolatry in the &s;ight of God, and idolatry is al&s;o adultery, how many are there in the world who entice Chri&s;tians into the&s;e evils, in order to gra&s;p the honours and profits of religion to them&s;elves!

And as Mr. Snow was advanced in years, and a young min|i&s;ter arrived there from Ireland in the &s;pring of 1791, he was called to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in preaching for two years. But in that time he drew off the majority of the church and congregation from the doctrine of &s;ove|reign grace, to the way of confounding works and grace together.

But he and his brethren called a council, who fully cleared him from tho&s;e accu&s;ations. And as &s;aid teacher was of the Methodi&s;t denomination, he could not have a legal right to the property of that Congrega|tional &s;ociety; therefore he changed his name to

Yet in the face of all this, they went into &s;aid hou&s;e, on October 17, 1793, and ordained him as a <HI>colleague pa&s;tor</HI> in that church.

<PB N="78" REF="030011_0077_0FE3BDADA7455C28">&s;aid unto him, Man, who made me a judge, or a di|vider over you? And he plainly holds forth, that the <HI>leaven of hypocri&s;y</HI> is promoted by confounding the government of church and &s;tate together. Luke xii, 1, 14, 15. And in order to purge the <HI>old leaven</HI> from the church, Paul &s;ays, I have written unto you, not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or <HI>covetous,</HI> or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner, with &s;uch an one, no not to eat. For what have I to do to judge them al&s;o that are without? Do not ye judge them that are within? But them that are without, God judgeth. Therefore put away from among your|&s;elves that wicked per&s;on. 1 Cor. v. 7&mdash;13. Cov|etou&s;ne&s;s is here put before idolatry, for it is the <HI>root of all evil.</HI> I Tim. vi. 10. And it is ea&s;ier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. But blind guides &s;train at a gnat, and &s;wallow a camel. Matt. xix. 24. xxiii. 24. And who can tell how many blind guides there are in our day? And the confounding the con&s;titutions of the Hebrew and the Chri&s;tian churches together, is the way in which they yoke Chri&s;tians with the world. But God &s;ays to his church, Be ye not unequally <HI>yoked</HI> together with <HI>unbelievers;</HI> for what fellow&s;hip hath righteou&s;ne&s;s with unrighteou&s;ne&s;s? and what communion hath light with darkne&s;s? and what concord hath Chri&s;t with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel? and what agreement hath the tem|ple of God with idols? For ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath &s;aid, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they &s;hall be my people. Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye <HI>&s;eparate,</HI> &s;aith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye &s;hall be my

It is not from civil commerce with unbelievers, but from being <HI>yoked</HI> with them in com|munion in the church, which is the temple of the living God, and is to be governed wholly by his re|vealed will, under the influence of his Spirit. But where worldly force is u&s;ed to &s;upport religious min|i&s;ters, it will be con&s;cientiou&s;ly oppo&s;ed by the faith|ful, and villains will hide behind &s;uch oppo&s;ition, and &s;o the government both of church and &s;tate are injured. Whereas if all were protected impartially, they who act from heavenly motives would &s;trength|en the hands of civil rulers, and hold up light to draw others out of evil ways, and to guard again&s;t all iniquity. And it will yet be &s;aid, Look upon Zion the city of our &s;olemnities: thine eyes &s;hall &s;ee Jeru&s;alem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that &s;hall not be taken down; not one of the &s;takes thereof &s;hall ever be removed, neither &s;hall any of the cords thereof be broken. But there the glorious Lord will be unto us a place of broad rivers and &s;treams, wherein &s;hall go no galley with oars, neither &s;hall gallant &s;hips pa&s;s thereby. For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our law-giver the Lord is our king; he will &s;ave us. I&s;aiah xxxiii. 20&mdash;22. Now if we con&s;ider, that galleys and gallant &s;hips are the greate&s;t engines of war and &s;lavery in all the world, and that they are upheld by national churches, how loud is the call from Heaven to come out and be &s;eparate from all &s;uch churches!</P>
<P N="9">IX. Indeed Dr. Lathrop, in order to keep up the power of mini&s;ters which he pleads for, &s;ays, "A Chri&s;tian church is compared to a hou&s;ehold, and to a city, in re&s;pect of the order and government, the peace and unity, that ought to be pre&s;erved in it. But if every man might a&s;&s;ume the office of a teacher at plea&s;ure, where would be the order and unity?
<PB N="80" REF="030011_0079_0FE3BDB296885B38">There would be the &s;ame confu&s;ion and di&s;traction, as in a State where every one claimed a right to ex|erci&s;e the powers of magi&s;tracy."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Di&s;cour&s;es on Matthew vii. 15, 16. p. 10, 11.</NOTE> But in all the States of New-England, the people can leave their governors, and all their legi&s;lators out of office every year, if they plea&s;e, while all the mini&s;ters, who are &s;upported by tax and compul&s;ion, deny the people any &s;uch liberty concerning them&s;elves. When the people have elected their rulers, &s;ome men are ap|pointed to give them an oath, to be faithful in their offices; and when the church of Chri&s;t hath cho&s;en her mini&s;ters, &s;he hath a right to call other mini&s;ters to ordain them, and to give them a &s;olemn charge to be faithful to God and to his people. But ever &s;ince mini&s;ters have claimed a power of office above all other men in the world, the government of the churches, the cities of God, has lain wa&s;te, to the grief of all pious people. Though the time is com|ing when our Lord will give &s;uch comfort and &s;trength to them who <HI>mourn in Zion,</HI> that he &s;ays, They &s;hall build the old wa&s;tes, they &s;hall rai&s;e up the former de&s;olations, they &s;hall repair the wa&s;te <HI>cities,</HI> the de&s;olations of many generations. I&s;aiah lxi. 1&mdash;4. This our Lord applies to the ble&s;&s;ings of his Spirit under the go&s;pel. Luke iv. 18, 19. Every church of Chri&s;t is a holy city, which has a right to cen&s;ure and exclude all members and officers who break his laws, and refu&s;e to manife&s;t repentance therefor. And when they &s;hall come to exerci&s;e this power faithfully, <HI>independent</HI> of all the powers of the world, &s;uch peace will be enjoyed as never hath yet been upon earth. And the power of one &s;ect in our land, to compel all others to bow to them in religious affairs, is daily con&s;uming, by the light and power of the go&s;pel. One evidence of this lately appeared in Medfield. A Bapti&s;t church was con&s;tituted there in 1776; and they built them a convenient hou&s;e
<PB N="81" REF="030011_0080_0FE3BB05E18976E8">for wor&s;hip, and another for the mini&s;try, and they have maintained regular wor&s;hip among them ever &s;ince. Yet all the Bapti&s;ts in Medfield were lately taxed to the Congregational mini&s;ter of that town; and one of their committee was &s;eized for that tax, and was impri&s;oned at Bo&s;ton, July 2, 1794. But it cau&s;ed &s;uch an alarm in Bo&s;ton, and the news from thence which reached to Medfield the next Saturday, cau&s;ed &s;uch an alarm there, that two men were &s;ent twenty miles on the Lord's day, who re|lea&s;ed the pri&s;oner, without his paying the tax, or any co&s;ts about it. And very few now in our coun|try will dare to make di&s;tre&s;s upon any for mini&s;te|rial taxes.</P>
<P N="10">X. And if the marks of fal&s;e teachers, which the above author has publi&s;hed, were rightly applied, the church of Chri&s;t would &s;oon have &s;uch deliver|ance from their power as &s;he hath not yet enjoyed. For he &s;ays, "Another mark of fal&s;e teachers is an implacable malignity again&s;t the &s;tanding, regular mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel." And again he &s;ays, "This &s;ort of teachers are guided by no <HI>line,</HI> and confined to no <HI>mea&s;ure;</HI> but run from place to place, enter into other men's labours, and build on other men's <HI>foundation.</HI>"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 29, 31.</NOTE> Very true; and the word of Chri&s;t is daily fulfilled, who &s;aid to fal&s;e teachers among the Jews, Ye compa&s;s &s;ea and land to make one pro&s;e|lyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than your&s;elves. Matthew xxiii. 15. And we may &s;ee at this day, that the Jews have a fixed regard for the law of Mo&s;es, and for the land of Canaan; but pro&s;elytes to revealed religion, who are not born again, have no fixed rule of con|duct, nor any country that can &s;et any bounds to their love of riches, honours or plea&s;ures. Some de|ceitful men in the church of Corinth, accu&s;ed Paul of going beyond his authority in what he had writ|ten
<PB N="82" REF="030011_0081_0FE3BDB796675A00">to that church. Therefore he &s;aid, The weap|ons of our warfare are <HI>not carnal,</HI> but mighty through God to the pulling down of &s;trong holds, ca&s;ting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalt|eth it&s;elf again&s;t the knowledge of God, and bring|ing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Chri&s;t; and having in a readine&s;s to revenge all di&s;|obedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.&mdash;For we &s;tretch not our&s;elves beyond our <HI>mea&s;ure,</HI> as though we reached not unto you; for we are come as far as to you al&s;o, in preaching the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t: not boa&s;ting of things without our <HI>mea&s;ure,</HI> that is, of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increa&s;ed, that we &s;hall be enlarg|ed by you according to our rule abundantly, to preach the go&s;pel in the region beyond you, and not to boa&s;t in another man's <HI>line,</HI> of things made ready to our hand. But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. For not he that commendeth him&s;elf is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth. 2 Cor. x. 4, 5, 14&mdash;18. The line and mea&s;ure which he &s;pake of was drawn by God him&s;elf, and not by any worldly powers. So the &s;ame apo&s;tle &s;aid to another church, I will not dare to &s;peak of any of tho&s;e things, which Chri&s;t hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word or deed, through mighty &s;igns and wonders, by the <HI>power of the Spirit of God;</HI> &s;o that from Jeru&s;alem and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preach|ed the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. Yea, &s;o have I &s;trived to preach the go&s;pel, not where Chri&s;t was named, le&s;t I &s;hould build upon another man's <HI>foundation.</HI> Rom. xv. 18&mdash;20. And can any man believe that the words, mea&s;ure, line, and foundation, as Paul u&s;ed them, can ju&s;tify the u&s;e of <HI>carnal</HI> weapons in forcing all people within lines which men have drawn, to &s;upport teachers who &s;tand upon worldly e&s;tabli&s;h|ments?

So then, brethren, we are not the children of the bond woman, but of the free. Stand fa&s;t, therefore, in the liberty where with Chri&s;t hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. Gal. iv. 28&mdash;31. v. 1. And how can we obey this law of Chri&s;t, if we commune with any in the holy &s;upper who were only &s;prinkled in their infancy? And a late in&s;tance may help to &s;hew the evil of &s;uch covenants. A man in one of the Congregational churches was con|vinced that he was not born again, and therefore re|frained from coming to the ordinance of the &s;upper. And after he obtained relief in his own mind, he viewed &s;uch evils in the church, and his wife al&s;o, that they thought they could not in con&s;cience come to communion therein, and refrained from it. The church &s;ent a committee to labour with them, and they reque&s;ted a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from the church; but in&s;tead of it, a cen&s;ure was &s;ent to them, which &s;aid, "With grief of heart we inform you, that we are greatly &s;tumbled at your conduct, in breaking a &s;ol|emn and &s;acred covenant with us, in which you bound your&s;elves, in the pre&s;ence of the great God, to walk in communion with us. By thus breaking communion with us, you are guilty of the wor&s;t kind of perjury.

And after trying to prove this from &s;cripture, and reciting the law of Chri&s;t about the power of binding and loo&s;ing, they &s;ay, "We ac|cordingly have met in the name of Je&s;us, and in his name we bind you under the cen&s;ure of its fir&s;t ad|monition." This was dated November 28, 1794. The mini&s;ter who &s;ent them this cen&s;ure has been a noted advocate for &s;upporting their way by law in our country. But how great mu&s;t be the bondage of any people, who mu&s;t come to communion in a &s;ociety where church and world are bound together, or be accu&s;ed of the wor&s;t kind of perjury?

John x. 1&mdash;9. And how much &s;tealing of his words is there in our land? The Congregational &s;cheme of church gov|ernment, came a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">near the go&s;pel plan, as any plan ever did which was upheld by the &s;word. But a zealous advocate for it lately &s;aid, "It is difficult to &s;ay what is the pre&s;ent eccle&s;ia&s;tical con&s;titution of the Congregational churches." And as to their faith, he &s;ays, "The body of them are Calvini&s;ts; a re&s;pectable proportion are what may be denomi|nated Hopkin&s;ian Calvini&s;ts; be&s;ide the&s;e, &s;ome are Arminians, &s;ome Arians, a few Socinians, and a number who have adopted Dr. Chauncy's &s;cheme of the final &s;alvation of all men."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mor&s;e's Geography, 1793, fir&s;t part. p. 252, 253.</NOTE> This account is doubtle&s;s true in general, though it is que&s;tionable whether there are not more Arminians in the churches who are &s;upported by law in this country, than there are of Calvini&s;ts. And va&s;t pains have been taken, both in Europe and America, to per|&s;uade the people, that all the wars and tyranny that have ever taken place under the Chri&s;tian name, have proceeded from the doctrines of Calvini&s;m. For it is well known that Augu&s;tine, and other fath|ers of the church in the third and fourth century, held to the &s;ame doctrines which Calvin embraced
<PB N="89" REF="030011_0088_0FE3BE2F35CA9970">in the time of the reformation from popery. But God &s;ays, Woe be to the &s;hepherds of I&s;rael, that feed them&s;elves: &s;hould not the &s;hepherds feed the flocks? Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, ye kill them that are fed, but ye feed not the flock. The di&s;ea&s;ed have ye not &s;trengthened, neither have ye healed that which was &s;ick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye &s;ought that which was lo&s;t; but with <HI>force</HI> and with <HI>cruelty</HI> have ye ruled them.&mdash;And as for you, O my flock, thus &s;aith the Lord God, Behold, I judge between cattle and cattle, between the rams and the he-goats. Seemeth it a &s;mall thing unto you, to have eaten up the good pa&s;ture, but ye mu&s;t tread down with your feet the re&s;idue of your pa&s;|tures? and to have drunk of the deep waters, but ye mu&s;t foul the re&s;idue with your feet? Ezek. xxxiv. 2&mdash;18. This is an exact de&s;cription of the beha|viour of fal&s;e teachers and profe&s;&s;ors, in every age and country, where revelation hath been known. The love of &s;elf, and of earthly power and gain, with ignorance of the infinite perfections of God, and a going about to e&s;tabli&s;h a righteou&s;ne&s;s of their own, hath cau&s;ed all the oppre&s;&s;ions and cruel per&s;e|cutions that ever were upon earth. And men have trampled upon the precious doctrines of the go&s;pel, and have defiled the deep waters of revelation, as wantonly and as cruelly as wanton cattle ever did, again&s;t the weak or the di&s;ea&s;ed. But if men in general were willing to be taught of God, and to obey the pure voice of his holy word, &s;uch peace and happine&s;s would &s;oon be enjoyed, as they will not now believe to be po&s;&s;ible in this world.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. Arians and Socinians, both deny that Je|&s;us Chri&s;t is God by nature, and the latter hold him to be no more than man. But there is no &s;uch faith as theirs in heaven, nor in hell, nor in heathen dark|ne&s;s.
<PB N="90" REF="030011_0089_0FE3BDC52ED201F8">For all the angels of heaven wor&s;hip Je&s;us as the Son of God. Heb. i. 6. Luke ii. 9&mdash;14. And the devils &s;aid, What have we to do with thee, Je&s;us thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before the time? Matt. viii. 29. And the great philo&s;ophers at Athens, the greate&s;t &s;eat of learning in the heathen world, got no further than to erect an altar <HI>to the unknown God,</HI> in the mid&s;t of many idols. Acts xvii. 23. So that all men who profe&s;s to wor&s;hip but One God, and yet deny that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is truly God, have corrupted their minds more than the devils ever could do, and have carried phi|lo&s;ophy and vain deceit beyond what the old hea|thens ever did. And God &s;ays, The&s;e &s;peak evil of tho&s;e things which they know not; but what they know naturally, as brute bea&s;ts, in tho&s;e things they corrupt them&s;elves. Jude 10. It is impo&s;&s;ible to harden brute bea&s;ts again&s;t fear of danger, to the de|gree that many men harden them&s;elves again&s;t the fear of God's wrath in a future world. The cau&s;e why earthly governments have no right to admit &s;ureties in capital ca&s;es, is becau&s;e the children of men cannot ju&s;tly lay crimes upon any innocent per|&s;on, nor rai&s;e a dead one to life, nor change the heart of a criminal. But it is as certain as any truth in the bible, that the Son of God freely gave him&s;elf to die for our &s;ins, and that he aro&s;e again for our ju&s;tification, and that he gives the Holy Spirit to change the heart of the chief of &s;inners, and to guide them in the way of holine&s;s to eternal happine&s;s. And it is not more certain from the word of God, that the righteous will have everla&s;ting life, than it is that all men who die in their &s;ins will have ever|la&s;ting mi&s;ery in hell. And all men who hold the contrary, de&s;troy the influence of promi&s;es and oaths, more than they do in the church of Rome, where they hold that &s;ome men will have their &s;ins purged away after death, by the help of the prayers of the
<PB N="91" REF="030011_0090_0FE3BE3251DAF028">living. Therefore the Congregational churches in New-England, have more pernicious errors held up among them, than there are in the church of Rome. And the apo&s;tle John &s;ays, Beloved, believe not ev|ery &s;pirit, but try the &s;pirits whether they be of God; becau&s;e many fal&s;e prophets are gone out into the world. Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every &s;pirit that confe&s;&s;eth that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is come in the fle&s;h, is of God. And every &s;pirit that confe&s;&s;eth not that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is come in the fle&s;h, is not of God: and this is that &s;pirit of antichri&s;t, whereof ye have heard that it &s;hould come, and even now already is it in the world. Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them; becau&s;e greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. They are of the world, therefore &s;peak they of the world, and the world heareth them. 1 John iv. 1&mdash;5. And worldly property is the only qualification for voters in our governments, for rulers and mini&s;ters; and yet each pari&s;h in Connecticut, is called an eccle&s;i|a&s;tical &s;ociety in the laws by which they &s;upport their mini&s;ters. That is, they are worldly churches. And though the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts do not call each par|i&s;h a church, yet they put the whole power of taxa|tion for religious teachers into the hands of the world, without the lea&s;t regard to the church of Chri&s;t in that re&s;pect. In another law, which was made in 1786, the deacons of each church are em|powered to receive donations for religious purpo&s;es, which they are to manage according to the de&s;ign of the donors, for the good of the church. And this opens a door for leading a quiet and peaceable life in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty. But the compelling of any man to &s;upport any religious teacher whom he doth not choo&s;e, is a denial of the authority of Chri&s;t. For he &s;ays, As ye would that men &s;hould do to you, do ye al&s;o to them likewi&s;e.&mdash;For every tree is known by his own fruit; for of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble-bu&s;h gather they grapes. A
<PB N="92" REF="030011_0091_0FE3BDCA12E839A8">good man out of the good trea&s;ure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil trea&s;ure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil; for of the abundance of the heart his mouth &s;peaketh. And why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I &s;ay? Luke vi. 31, 44&mdash;46. How do all men practically deny Je&s;us Chri&s;t to be Lord, who refu&s;e to believe and obey him? For unto the pure all things are pure; but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving, is noth|ing pure; but even their mind and con&s;cience is defiled. They profe&s;s that they know God, but in woks they deny him, being abominable, and di&s;o|bedient, and unto every good work reprobate. Titus i. 15, 16. And all men allow that actions &s;peak louder than words, and al&s;o that injuries from pro|fe&s;&s;ed friends, are more grievous than from open en|emies. How full then is the world of the iniquity of denying that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is come in the fle&s;h? And this is according to the prophecy which &s;ays, There are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, un|godly men, turning the grace of our God into la&s;|civiou&s;ne&s;s, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Jude 4. All men who in|dulge them&s;elves in &s;in becau&s;e God is infinitely gracious, are more or le&s;s guilty of the&s;e evils. And though the national church of I&s;rael was con&s;tituted by God him&s;elf, yet all orders among them became &s;o corrupt that he &s;aid, The be&s;t of them is as a bri|er, the mo&s;t upright is &s;harper than a thorn-hedge. Micah vii. 4. And if it was &s;o with a church which God formed, how much more de&s;tructive are churches that are formed by the laws of men, en|forced by the &s;word? How do all men practically deny Je&s;us Chri&s;t to be Lord, who refu&s;e to obey his laws for the government of his church? But how have the churches increa&s;ed in our land, who hold him to be their only lawgiver?</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. A CONCISE VIEW OF THE SECTS IN AMERICA, AND OF THEIR DIFFERENT ASSOCIATIONS.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>I.</HI> Religious Liberty is not the Cau&s;e of Sects and Parties among Chri&s;tians. <HI>II.</HI> A View of our Southern States. <HI>III.</HI> Each Church of Chri&s;t &s;hould act as one united Body. <HI>IV.</HI> An Account of the Warren A&s;&s;ociation. <HI>V.</HI> And of tho&s;e of Stonington, New-Hamp&s;hire, Shaft&s;bury, Wood&s;tock, Bowdoinham, Ver|mont, Meredith, Danbury and Leyden. <HI>VI.</HI> The Nature of the&s;e A&s;&s;ociations de&s;cribed. <HI>VII.</HI> And of three others, with general Ob&s;ervations upon the uni|ver&s;al Rule of Equity.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. WHAT &s;hall we think of the prophecy in the be|ginning of this volume? For it &s;ays, "Through the liberty enjoyed here, all religious &s;ects will grow up in|to large and re&s;pectable bodies. But the Congregation|al and Pre&s;byterian denomination, however hitherto de&s;pi&s;ed, will, by the ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven, continue to hold the greate&s;t figure in America; and, notwith|&s;tanding all the fruitle&s;s labours and exertions to pro&s;elyte us to other communions, become more nu|merous than the whole collective body of our fellow Prote&s;tants in Europe. The whole pro&s;elyti&s;m of New-England in particular, for &s;ixty or &s;eventy years pa&s;t, has not exceeded eight or ten thou&s;and, while our augment in that term, by natural increa&s;e, has been half a million." In the fir&s;t place there was a great mi&s;take, in &s;uppo&s;ing that religious liberty would favour the growth of religious &s;ects. For cruel oppre&s;&s;ion was the cau&s;e of the increa&s;e of &s;ects in England, as it was of the flight of our fathers into America. And the hanging of four Quakers in Bo&s;ton, greatly promoted their &s;ect in this country;
<PB N="108" REF="030011_0107_0FE3BEBC8C2F04C0">and the light and liberty which has been enjoyed in latter years has been far from increa&s;ing their num|ber. The &s;ect which John Rogers began at New-London in 1677, owed its increa&s;e to the &s;everity of Connecticut government again&s;t them; and &s;ince that has cea&s;ed, their &s;ociety has nearly di&s;&s;olved. And although the Sandemanians made a great noi&s;e in New-England, from 1764 to 1775, yet, having no oppre&s;&s;ion to complain of, they have hardly a name now left among us. The followers of Jemima Wil|kin&s;on, al&s;o, who made their appearance October, 1776, and continued for &s;ome years after, are now all gone from among us. And though the Shakers were a large body when the above prophecy was publi&s;hed, yet we &s;eldom hear of them now, unle&s;s it be by way of ob&s;erving that the power which then actuated them is gone; and their attention is much fixed upon worldly &s;chemes of gain. Epi&s;copalians received va&s;t &s;ums of money from England to &s;up|port their mini&s;ters, from 1701 to 1775, and tho&s;e who turned to them were exempted from taxes to Congregational mini&s;ters; and as oppre&s;&s;ion was greater in Connecticut, than in other governments in New-England, they increa&s;ed the mo&s;t there; but &s;ince the independence of America, they do not in|crea&s;e in mo&s;t parts of the country; and in the whole of the old colony of Plymouth they have but one mini&s;ter, and he hath but a few hearers. And if the Congregational and Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, Connecticut, New-Hamp&s;hire and Vermont, had not the &s;word of the magi&s;trate to &s;upport them, no one can tell how &s;mall their num|ber would &s;oon be.</P>
<P N="2">II. And as the above prophecy refers to all Amer|ica, we are called to look into our &s;outhern States. After our independence was e&s;tabli&s;hed, the Pre&s;by|terians in tho&s;e parts entered upon mea&s;ures to unite all their &s;ocieties under one head; to promote which,
<PB N="109" REF="030011_0108_0FE3BF088CB15420">a book was publi&s;hed in North-Carolina in 1788, wherein the author &s;ays, "I have often thought, that the popular Congregational government of the Inde|pendents, joined to the Pre&s;byterial judicatures, as a final re&s;ort, would form the mo&s;t perfect model of church government that the &s;tate of things on earth will admit of." But this model hath been tried in Connecticut, with the &s;word of the magi&s;|trate to help it, ever &s;ince 1708, and how far is it now from perfection? In the &s;ame page, the author &s;ays of the Bapti&s;ts in tho&s;e parts, "Con&s;idering that they have no written &s;tandard of orthodoxy, and that their preachers are men without a liberal education, I have often &s;at with wonder and plea&s;ure to hear them &s;o &s;ound in doctrine as they really are. In church government, the Bapti&s;ts have adopted the independent plan; the inconveniency of which they often experience, as it provides no final and deci&s;ive judge of controver&s;y, nor tribunal to pronounce on here&s;y or fal&s;e doctrine. But the di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tic of the Bapti&s;t profe&s;&s;ion is their ex|cluding infant, and practi&s;ing only adult bapti&s;m, and making it their great term of communion, ex|cluding all other Chri&s;tians from the Lord's table among them, and not &s;uffering their members to communicate with other churches. How they can acknowledge any other people to be a church of Chri&s;t, and yet continue this bar of &s;eparation, is not to be accounted for."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pattillo's Sermons, p. 48, 49.</NOTE> But if the holy &s;criptures are not a perfect &s;tandard of orthodoxy, and if each par|ticular church of Chri&s;t hath not power from him to receive all members and officers who are de&s;cribed therein, and al&s;o to exclude all officers and members who break his laws and refu&s;e to manife&s;t repentance therefor, we know not where to go for any rule of faith and conduct; nor for power to govern us in religious affairs. And as to his la&s;t difficulty, it may
<PB N="110" REF="030011_0109_0FE3BEC1A47BA150">be ob&s;erved, that circumci&s;ion was as nece&s;&s;ary in a member of the church of I&s;rael, as bapti&s;m can be in the church of Chri&s;t: yet Mo&s;es, that eminent &s;er|vant of God, did not circumci&s;e his children while he was in Midian; but when he was going to lead I&s;rael out of their bondage in Egypt, he was con|&s;trained to have them circumci&s;ed, even at the peril of his own life. Exod. iv. 24, 25. And the nation of I&s;rael were the church of God in the wilderne&s;s, and yet they did not circumci&s;e their children for forty years; though they were not &s;uffered to neglect it in the promi&s;ed land. Jo&s;hua v. 2&mdash;5. And the church of Chri&s;t hath been in Egyptian bondage, and in a great and terrible wilderne&s;s, ever &s;ince the bea&s;t aro&s;e out of the bottomle&s;s pit. Rev. xi. 2, 8. xii. 14. xiii. 5. The cau&s;e why many Chri&s;tians were for continuing circumci&s;ion, after it was out of date, was the fear of per&s;ecution for the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t. But Paul &s;aid, God forbid that I &s;hould glory, &s;ave in the cro&s;s of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. For in Chri&s;t Je&s;us neither circumci&s;ion availeth any thing, nor uncircumci&s;ion, but a new creature. Gal. vi. 12&mdash;15. But infant bapti&s;m binds the church and world together, in&s;tead of crucifying any one to the world, and the world to him. Yet our author &s;ays of the Bapti&s;ts, "They made their ap|pearance in Germany &s;oon after the reformation be|gan. But the pre&s;ent race of Bapti&s;ts are happily very unlike the furious and blood-thir&s;ty bigots who wore the name at that time."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 47.</NOTE> As if Chri&s;t and his di&s;ciples had not been Bapti&s;ts near fifteen hundred years before the reformation in Germany. And has any man ever been able to produce a mention of in|fant bapti&s;m before the third century? And in the next century, Con&s;tantine brought the &s;word into the church to puni&s;h heretics, and to &s;upport reli|gious
<PB N="111" REF="030011_0110_0FE3BF0D307267A0">mini&s;ters; and blood and &s;lavery, deceit and cruelty, have followed tho&s;e &s;uper&s;titions ever &s;ince, though many good men have been en&s;nared in tho&s;e ways. In the year 1789 many Pre&s;byterians met at Philadelphia, and formed a tribunal which they called, "The General A&s;&s;embly of the Pre&s;byterian Church, in the United States of America." And they opened a corre&s;pondence with the General A&s;&s;ociation in Connecticut; and a delegate from thence to the Pre&s;byterian a&s;&s;embly at Philadelphia in May, 1793, &s;aid in a letter to England the fall after, "There are nearly as many mini&s;ters of our order in Connecti|cut, as there are Pre&s;byterians in all the States to the &s;outhward of Connecticut."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rippon's Regi&s;ter, Vol. II, p. 131.</NOTE> That is, in ten States, in which are nearly three million of people, they have but about two hundred Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters. How far then is the Congregational and Pre&s;byteri|an denomination in America from ri&s;ing above all other Prote&s;tants, both here and in Europe?</P>
<P N="3">III. And if we &s;earch the &s;criptures, we &s;hall find, that a being born again by the power of the Spirit of God, and a receiving &s;pecial gifts from him for the mini&s;try, is the only way that he hath revealed, for any to come into the church, and into the work of preaching the go&s;pel as they ought, let their edu|cation be what it may. Hence the fir&s;t apo&s;tle &s;ays, As every man hath received the gift, even &s;o min|i&s;ter the &s;ame one to another, as good &s;tewards of the manifold grace of God. If any man &s;peak, let him &s;peak as the oracles of God; if any man min|i&s;ter, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth; that God in all things may be glorified through Je|&s;us Chri&s;t.&mdash;The elders which are among you I ex|hort, who am al&s;o an elder, and a witne&s;s of the &s;uf|ferings of Chri&s;t, and al&s;o a partaker of the glory that &s;hall be revealed; feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the over&s;ight thereof, not by
<PB N="112" REF="030011_0111_0FE3BEC68E050CE0">con&s;traint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being en&s;amples to the flock. And when the chief Shepherd &s;hall appear, ye &s;hall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away. Likewi&s;e, ye younger, &s;ubmit your&s;elves unto the elder; yea, all of you be &s;ubject one to another, and be clothed with humility; for God re&s;i&s;teth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. I. Pet. iv. 10, 11. v. 1&mdash;5. Lord&s;hip is of the Gentiles, and they tread the holy city under foot forty and two months, or for a time, and times, and half a time, while the church is in the wilderne&s;s. Mark x. 42. Rev. xi. 2. xii. 14. Men trample upon the holy government, which Chri&s;t hath appointed in his church, as long as the power of the bea&s;t continues. And they &s;ay, Who is like unto the bea&s;t? who is able to make war with him?&mdash;They that dwell on the earth &s;hall wonder (who&s;e names are not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world) when they behold the bea&s;t that was, and is not, and yet is. Rev. xiii. 4. xvii. 8. Deceit and cruelty, under a ma&s;k of religion and government, have changed into all &s;hapes that can be conceived of; and who hath been like the pre&s;ent &s;cheme? or who is able to war with the governing powers? are the great rea&s;ons for complying with the e&s;tabli&s;hed wor&s;hip, or at lea&s;t for not boldly appearing to renounce all the laws and inventions of men in the wor&s;hip of God, and in the government of his church.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The Congregational mini&s;ters in the Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts meet in a&s;&s;ociations when they plea&s;e, with|out any act of their churches; and they act many things in private, and claim the whole power of li|cen&s;ing candidates for the mini&s;try; and in Con|necticut they al&s;o advi&s;e to the calling a con&s;ociation in each county, when they think proper, to revoke acts of particular churches, or to cen&s;ure &s;uch mini&s;|ters
<PB N="113" REF="030011_0112_0FE3BF11C590F510">or churches as they judge to be guilty. They likewi&s;e choo&s;e delegates in each county, to meet once a year in a general a&s;&s;ociation of mini&s;ters by them&s;elves, from all parts of that State. But the Bapti&s;ts had &s;uffered &s;o much from the&s;e mea&s;ures, that they could not be per&s;uaded to meet in a&s;&s;ocia|tions for many years, though upon quite a different plan. Yet in September, 1766, a number of elders and brethren agreed to &s;end an invitation to their churches, to appoint a meeting the next year, to confer upon the&s;e things. And on September 8, 1767, ten churches met by delegation at Warren, with three mini&s;ters from the Philadelphia A&s;&s;ociation, and a letter from thence on the &s;ubject. Mo&s;t of tho&s;e who met thought they were not prepared to proceed then, but four churches were ready, and them formed an a&s;&s;ociation, and named it from the town where they met; namely, the churches of War|ren, Haverhill, Bellingham, and the &s;econd in Mid|dleborough. And as the annual commencement at our college is on the fir&s;t Wedne&s;day in September, and &s;ome who come to it from a di&s;tance would de|&s;ire to attend the a&s;&s;ociation al&s;o, it was appointed to be on the Tue&s;day after the commencement. They accordingly met at Warren, September 13, 1768, when four churches joined to this A&s;&s;ociation, as four more did at Warren, September 12, 1769. Their next meeting was at Bellingham, September 11, 1770, and they met again at Sutton, September 10, 1771, when they had increa&s;ed to twenty churches, and 837 members; and they then began to print minutes of their proceedings, which they have done ever &s;ince. And the churches in the foregoing li&s;t who are now in the Warren A&s;&s;ociation, are the two in Bo&s;ton, tho&s;e in Bellingham, Haverhill, Warren, Middleborough, Charlton, Royal&s;tone, Wrentham, South-Brimfield, the fir&s;t in Attleborough, Wilbra|ham, Wood&s;tock, and Freetown, tho&s;e in Chelmsford,
<PB N="114" REF="030011_0113_0FE3BEC9C767F348">Harwich, Barn&s;table, New-Salem, Leice&s;ter, Med|field, Harvard, Newton, Salem in New-Hamp&s;hire, Cambridge, Northbridge, Providence, Glouce&s;ter, Sturbridge, A&s;hburnham, Templeton, Rowley, We&s;|ton, Bridgwater, Randolph, Mar&s;hfield, Carver, Hollis, Hardwick, and Belcherton; extending over all the old colonies of Plymouth and the Ma&s;&s;achu|setts, excepting what is we&s;t of Connecticut river, and into three adjoining States. This A&s;&s;ociation have begun to collect a fund for the purpo&s;e of a&s;|&s;i&s;ting pious young men in obtaining human learning, with a view to the go&s;pel mini&s;try. Thirteen men were cho&s;en by this A&s;&s;ociation, and were incorpo|rated by the legi&s;lature of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts in Feb|ruary, 1794, to manage a fund for this purpo&s;e. This A&s;&s;ociation are to fill up vacancies, when any happen, as long as the A&s;&s;ociation continues; and if it &s;hould ever be di&s;&s;olved, the corporation are then to elect their own members, in perpetual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. They are inve&s;ted with all nece&s;&s;ary powers for re|ceiving e&s;tates, real or per&s;onal, until the income thereof &s;hall amount to a thou&s;and pounds; and to u&s;e and improve the income of the fund for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;uch young per&s;ons in their education for the Bapti&s;t mini&s;try, as the majority of the tru&s;tees &s;hall determine to be &s;ubjects thereof. A &s;mall fund for this purpo&s;e is already collected, and all their generous friends are &s;olicited to increa&s;e it, to pro|mote &s;uch a u&s;eful in&s;titution.</P>
<P N="5">V. The benefits of the Warren A&s;&s;ociation &s;oon be|came &s;o evident, that others were formed in many parts of the country. The Stonington A&s;&s;ociation began in 1772, which now includes three Bapti&s;t churches in Stonington, the fir&s;t in Groton, New-London, and Saybrook, tho&s;e in Colche&s;ter, Montville, Chatham, Ea&s;t-Haddam, &s;econd and third in A&s;hford, the &s;econd in Wood&s;tock, tho&s;e of Hampton, Plainfield, Exeter, We&s;t-Greenwich, and two in Richmond, in the
<PB N="115" REF="030011_0114_0FE3BF17368970E8">States of Connecticut and Rhode-I&s;land. Their an|nual meeting is on the third Tue&s;day of October. The New-Hamp&s;hire A&s;&s;ociation began in 1776, and now includes the Bapti&s;t churches of Brentwood, Northwood, Gilmantown, Sali&s;bury, Madbury and Berwick, Sanford, Wells, Coxhall, one in Shapleigh, and Waterborough, Corni&s;h, and Fryeburgh, extend|ing acro&s;s the ea&s;t part of New-Hamp&s;hire, and over the country of York in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. Their an|nual meeting is on the &s;econd Wedne&s;day in June. The Shaft&s;bury A&s;&s;ociation began in 1781, in which are now three churches in Shaft&s;bury, two in Che&s;hire, tho&s;e of Pownal, Pittsfield, Che&s;terfield, Hancock, Bullock&s;grant, Stockbridge, Wa&s;hington, fir&s;t in Sandisfield and Great-Barrington, with William&s;ton, in Vermont and the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and twenty-five churches in the State of New-York. Their yearly meeting is on the fir&s;t Wedne&s;day in June. The Wood&s;tock A&s;&s;ociation began in 1783, in which are now the churches of Wood&s;tock, Canaan, Bridg|water, Wind&s;or, Hartford, Royalton, Sharon, That|ford, Norwich, Cambridge, Alburgh, Che&s;ter, Rock|ingham, We&s;tmin&s;ter, Ward&s;burgh, We&s;tmoreland, Marlow, Ma&s;on, Temple, Dublin, Newport, Al&s;tead, Corni&s;h, Wendal, Plainfield, Sutton, New-London, Hopkinton, and Grafton, in New-Hamp&s;hire and Vermont, and one in Canada. Another connexion of churches was formed in tho&s;e parts in 1795, called, The Richmond Convention, of whom I have not ob|tained a particular account. The annual meeting of the Wood&s;tock A&s;&s;ociation is on the la&s;t Wedne&s;day of September. The Bowdoinham A&s;&s;ociation began in 1787, and it now contains the Bapti&s;t churches of Bowdoinham, Harp&s;well, Bowdoin, Hebron, Buck|field, Paris, Thoma&s;ton, Va&s;&s;alborough, Ball&s;ton, Sidney, Readfield, Sterling, Mu&s;congus, Cu&s;hing, Lewi&s;ton, Nobleborough, Greene and New-Sandwich, in the counties of Cumberland and Lincoln, in the
<PB N="116" REF="030011_0115_0FE3BECF41517E70">di&s;trict of Maine. Their annual meeting is on the third Wedne&s;day in Augu&s;t. The Vermont A&s;&s;ocia|tion began al&s;o in 1787, and it contains the churches of Clarendon, Manche&s;ter, Middletown, Hubbard|ton, Ira, Wallingford, Orwell, Pittsford, Brandon, Powlet, Shoreham and Georgia, in Vermont, with three in the State of New-York. Their annual meeting is on the fir&s;t Wedne&s;day of October. The Meredith A&s;&s;ociation began in 1789, and it includes the churches of Meredith, Sandwich, Holderne&s;s, Rumney, Landaff and Bradford, Dartmouth, Went|worth, Cockermouth, Sandburnton, Corinth and Ver&s;hire, and Danville, in New-Hamp&s;hire and Ver|mont. Their annual meeting is on the &s;econd Wed|ne&s;day in September. The Danbury A&s;&s;ociation began in 1790, and it includes the churches of Danbury, Suffield, We&s;tfield, Canaan, Wallingford, Farming|ton, Roxbury, Warren, Watertown, New-Hartfond, New-Milford, Sharon, one in Sandisfield, Colebrook, Ea&s;t-Hartford, Newtown, Litchfield, Stratfield, and three in the State of New-York. It extends from the &s;outh borders of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts we&s;t of the great river acro&s;s Connecticut to the &s;ea. The churches of Ridgefield, Stamford and Greenwich, belong to Warwick A&s;&s;ociation in the State of New-York. The annual meeting of the Danbury A&s;&s;ocia|tion is on the third Wedne&s;day of September. The Leyden A&s;&s;ociation began in 1793, in which are the churches of Leyden, Bernard&s;ton, Richmond, Lev|erett, two in Guilford, Colerain, Putney, Somer&s;et, Dummer&s;ton, Halifax, Buckland and A&s;hfield, on the north &s;ide of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and on the cor|ners of Vermont and New-Hamp&s;hire. Their an|nual meeting is on the &s;econd Wedne&s;day of Octo|ber. As I failed of obtaining the la&s;t minutes of the Vermont, Meredith, and Leyden A&s;&s;ociations, their numbers &s;tand as they were in 1794, the others as they were in 1795. If any mi&s;takes are
<PB N="117" REF="030011_0116_0FE3BF1BC9CBE388">di&s;covered, and any man will point them out, the au|thor would account it a favour, and take the be&s;t way he can to correct them.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The&s;e a&s;&s;ociations refu&s;e to hear and judge of any per&s;onal controver&s;y in any church, or to inter|meddle with the affairs of any church which hath not joined with them. When any church would join to any a&s;&s;ociation, they &s;end a letter and me&s;&s;engers there|to, informing when their church was con&s;tituted, the faith and order of it, and their number of members. If &s;atisfaction is obtained, they are received by a vote of the a&s;&s;ociation, and the moderator gives the me&s;|&s;engers the right hand of fellow&s;hip. And each church &s;ends a letter and me&s;&s;engers, or a letter at lea&s;t, to the a&s;&s;ociation every year, to give an account of the &s;tate of the church, and how many have been added, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, died, or have been excluded in the year pa&s;t. If the&s;e things are neglected for a number of years, or if the church departs from her former faith or order, &s;he is left out of the a&s;&s;ociation. By the&s;e means, mutual acquaintance and communion has been begotten and promoted; the weak and op|pre&s;&s;ed have been relieved; errors in doctrine and practice have been expo&s;ed and guarded again&s;t; fal&s;e teachers have been expo&s;ed, and warnings again&s;t them have been publi&s;hed; de&s;titute flocks have been occa&s;ionally &s;upplied; many have been animated and encouraged in preaching the go&s;pel through the land, and in our new plantations in the wilderne&s;s. And it is hoped that the&s;e duties will yet be more attended to, and that greater ble&s;&s;ings will hereafter be granted. For our Lord &s;aid to his di&s;ciples, I have yet many things to &s;ay unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. Howbeit, when he the Spirit of truth is come he &s;hall guide you into all truth. He had ju&s;t before &s;aid, The time cometh, that who|&s;oever killeth you, will think that he doeth God &s;er|vice. John xvi. 2, 12, 13. And what is there that is
<PB N="118" REF="030011_0117_0FE3BED3CF050050">harder to bear than to hear of being killed for Chri&s;t's fake? Reviling and lying on the one hand, and worldly enticements and flatteries on the other, are much harder to &s;tand boldly again&s;t than open vio|lence, torture and death. For the earth helped the woman, when &s;he was enduring bloody per&s;ecution, and the people forced her per&s;ecutors to de&s;i&s;t from their cruel mea&s;ures. But it is very hard to make the people believe, that we are &s;uffering for the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t, when we refu&s;e to call in the power of the magi&s;trate to &s;upport religious mini&s;ters, or to puni&s;h any who injure us on religious accounts. Yet God &s;ays, Avenge not your&s;elves, but rather give place unto wrath, for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, &s;aith the Lord. Rom. xii. 19. Deceit and cruelty hath ever prevailed more in the world, under the ma&s;k of religion and government, than they po&s;&s;ibly could in any other way. Therefore our Lord requires his mini&s;ters to depart out of every city or hou&s;e where they refu&s;e to receive his go&s;pel, and he &s;ays, Freely ye have received, freely give. Mat. x. 8, 15. But this command hath ever been violated, where teachers have been &s;upported by the &s;word of the magi&s;trate. And the combination of teachers and rulers, in &s;chemes of power and gain, under the name of Chri&s;tianity, hath filled the world with blood and &s;lavery. And I believe that this combination is the bea&s;t and the fal&s;e prophet, who will be ca&s;t into the burning lake. Rev. xix. 11&mdash;21. For where mini&s;ters are &s;upported by the &s;word, deceitful men are armed again&s;t the children of God. And where that power is renounced, many will re|quire the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t to go a warfare at their own charges, becau&s;e he &s;ays, Freely ye have receiv|ed, freely give. As if freedom belonged only to min|i&s;ters, while the people are &s;laves to their lu&s;ts. For God &s;ays, To whom ye yield your&s;elves &s;ervants to obey, his &s;ervants ye are to whom ye obey; whether
<PB N="119" REF="030011_0118_0FE3BF212C35BBD8">of &s;in unto death, or of obedience unto righteou&s;|ne&s;s. Rom. vi. 16.</P>
<P N="7">VII. But our a&s;&s;ociations appeared to be &s;o help|ful to guard again&s;t the&s;e evils, and to promote real religion, that the churches who held to mixed com|munion began a yearly meeting in 1785, under the name of, The Groton Conference. And it now includes the Bapti&s;t churches of Dartmouth, New-Bedford, two in Rehoboth, two in North-King&s;ton, one in South-King&s;ton, New-Shoreham, two in We&s;t|erly, and one in each of the towns of Groton, Ston|ington, Lyme, Saybrook, Sutton, Pre&s;ton and Can|terbury, extending over part of three States. The church in Dighton, &s;econd in Attleborough, and &s;ome others, have given up communion in the ordi|nance of the &s;upper with any who were only &s;prinkled in infancy, and the re&s;t of tho&s;e churches appear in|clined to do the &s;ame, and to come into fellow&s;hip with our a&s;&s;ociated churches. The old Bapti&s;t churches have revived their a&s;&s;ociations, &s;ince the year 1774, though the &s;econd churches in Swan&s;ea and Newport do not attend them, nor the fir&s;t in Cumberland. But the churches of John&s;ton, Smith|field, two in Rehoboth, two in Scituate, two in Glou|ce&s;ter, two in Warwick, the fir&s;t in the towns of Fo&s;|ter, Coventry, North-King&s;ton, and Richmond, one in Ea&s;t-Greenwich, the &s;econd in Che&s;hire, and the third in Shaft&s;bury, are in that connexion. The Bapti&s;t churches who hold the &s;eventh day of the week as the Sabbath, have al&s;o their annual meetings. Of the&s;e are the third church in Newport, the fir&s;t in Hopkinton, the &s;econd in New-London, and the church in Bri&s;tol in Connecticut. There are a num|ber more of Bapti&s;t churches in various parts of our land who have not joined to any a&s;&s;ociation, but they are coming into them from year to year, while many others are formed. I have al&s;o heard of a few Bap|ti&s;t churches upon our ea&s;tern coa&s;ts, who do not
<PB N="120" REF="030011_0119_0FE3BE52DD67D118">hold with other churches there about the doctrines of grace; but I have not obtained &s;o di&s;tinct account of their affairs and connexions as may be &s;erviceable to the public. The world is &s;o full of controver&s;y, that all our powers ought to be engaged to promote truth and peace among all men. And for this end God &s;ays, Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high-minded, nor tru&s;t in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy; that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to di&s;tribute, willing to communicate; laying up in &s;tore for them&s;elves a good foundation again&s;t the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life. For perver&s;e di&s;putings, profane and vain babblings, and oppo&s;itions of &s;cience, fal&s;ely &s;o called, all proceed from the love of money, which is the root of all evil. 1 Tim. vi. 5, 10, 17&mdash;20. The knowledge of the truth is ever the &s;ame, in eve|ry age, and every country; but the oppo&s;ition of fal&s;e notions of knowledge, hath filled the world with controver&s;y and confu&s;ion. Further evidence of this will appear in the following hi&s;tory of par|ticular churches, and of the oppre&s;&s;ions which many have endured.</P>

<P N="1">I. OUR fathers fled to America for religious puri|ty and liberty, with a per&s;ua&s;ion that each believer &s;tands in the &s;ame relation to his children, as Abra|ham did to his in the covenant of circumci&s;ion. But &s;oon after they came to Bo&s;ton, a difficulty aro&s;e about their children, who were grown up &s;o as to have families, and yet were not true believers them|&s;elves, &s;o as to bring their children upon their own faith to bapti&s;m. The church in Dorche&s;ter wrote to the church in Bo&s;ton, to inquire whether a grand|father might not bring &s;uch infants? Mr. Cotton and his church concluded that he might, only with two cautions.
<LIST>
<ITEM>"1. That the grandchild, baptized by right of the grandfather's covenant, be committed to the grandfather's education.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the parents of the child, do not thereby take occa&s;ion to neglect the due and &s;ea&s;onable preparation of them&s;elves for entrance into covenant with God and his church."</ITEM>
</LIST>
This was dated December 16, 1634, about four years after Bo&s;ton was planted. And on October 11, 1648, Mr. Cotton wrote to a friend in England, and
<PB N="122" REF="030011_0121_0FE3BED8C6685D98">&s;aid, "Though they be not fit to make &s;uch a pro|fe&s;&s;ion of vi&s;ible faith as to admit them to the Lord's table, yet they may make profe&s;&s;ion full enough to receive them to bapti&s;m, or to the &s;ame &s;tate I&s;hmael &s;tood in after circumci&s;ion."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Increa&s;e Mather on the fir&s;t principles of New-England about bapti&s;m, 1675. p. 2, 3, 6.</NOTE> But I&s;hmael and E&s;au were both excluded from the covenant of circumci|&s;ion long before the pa&s;&s;over was in&s;tituted, of which &s;ervants were obliged to partake, as well as all the children of I&s;rael. And Mr. Henry Dun&s;tar, the fir&s;t pre&s;ident of Cambridge college, &s;aw their mi&s;|take in the&s;e things &s;o clearly, that he boldly preach|ed again&s;t infant bapti&s;m, and for believers' bapti&s;m, in the pulpit at Cambridge in 1653, the year after Me&s;&s;rs. Clarke, Holmes and Crandal were impri&s;on|ed at Bo&s;ton, only for wor&s;hipping God by them|&s;elves, without leave from the ruling powers in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. But tho&s;e powers compelled Mr. Dun&s;tar to re&s;ign his office in college; and he re|moved out of their juri&s;diction, and &s;pent the re&s;t of his days, even five years, at Scituate in Plymouth colony.</P>
<P N="2">II. In the year 1655, Thomas Gould, of Charle&s;|town, was &s;o fully convinced that infants had no right to bapti&s;m, that he refu&s;ed to bring his child thereto; but for this he was cen&s;ured in the church and pro&s;ecuted in their courts, until &s;ome Bapti&s;ts came to him out of England, and they formed a Bapti&s;t church there, May 28, 1665, and Gould became their pa&s;tor. But the leaders of this church were fined and impri&s;oned, from time to time, until a &s;entence of bani&s;hment was pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t Thomas Gould, William Turner, and John Farnum; and becau&s;e they would not bani&s;h them&s;elves, they were impri&s;oned at Bo&s;ton, in July, 1668, where they were confined about a year. But in the Indian war, &s;even years after, a company of tho&s;e Bapti&s;t were
<PB N="123" REF="030011_0122_0FE3BF2B0A7EEB90">&s;ent out again&s;t the enemy, and Turner was their captain, and &s;acrificed his life for the government by whom he had been per&s;ecuted. And in January, 1678, this church had increa&s;ed &s;o much, that they concluded to build them a meeting-hou&s;e in Bo&s;ton, though with &s;o much caution as not to let the ruling powers know what it was de&s;igned for, until they met in it, February 15, 1679. But in May follow|ing a law was made, to forbid all per&s;ons to erect or make u&s;e of any hou&s;e for public wor&s;hip, without licen&s;e from the ruling powers, upon penalty of for|feiting the hou&s;e and land, and all private ways lead|ing to it. And a &s;ynod was called in September, who gave it as their opinion, that &s;uffering tho&s;e Bapti&s;ts to meet for wor&s;hip by them&s;elves, was a cau&s;e of the judgments of God upon the land; therefore their meeting-hou&s;e was nailed up by or|der of court in March, 1680, and Dr. Increa&s;e Mather publi&s;hed a book again&s;t them the &s;ame month, in which he &s;aid, "Antipedobapti&s;m is a bla&s;ted error."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Divine Right of Infant Bapti&s;m, p. 20.</NOTE> But he and his brethrein met with &s;uch cruel oppre&s;&s;ion &s;oon after, as moved them to procure a &s;pecial act, to exempt Bo&s;ton from any compul&s;ive power for the &s;upport of any religious mini&s;ters. And he and his &s;on Cotton Mather, with Mr. John Webb, went into the hou&s;e which their party had nailed up, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in ordaining a Bapti&s;t mini&s;ter, as a pa&s;tor of that Bapti&s;t church. Mr. Gould was a pa&s;tor of that church, from its beginning until his death about 1676; and he was &s;uch an example of meekne&s;s, faith and patience as is &s;eldom found. Mr. I&s;aac Hull was called to the pa&s;toral office in that church in the time of their &s;uf|ferings, and continued therein till 1689, and how much longer their records do not di&s;cover. Mr. John Ru&s;&s;ell, who &s;uffered impri&s;onment for the cau&s;e of con&s;cience, was ordained a pa&s;tor of that church,
<PB N="124" REF="030011_0123_0FE3BEDBE74BFF60">July 28, 1679, and he wrote a defence of their cau&s;e in 1680, which was printed in London, with a pre|face by &s;ix noted mini&s;ters there. But he was taken away by death, December 21, 1680, much lament|ed by his people; and his po&s;terity are numerous and re&s;pectable in the&s;e parts to this day. Their next mini&s;ter was Mr. John Emblen, from England, who mini&s;tered to them from 1684, to 1699, or thereabouts. He appears to have been well e&s;teem|ed among them, as far as I could obtain any infor|mation. After his death the church wrote again to England for a mini&s;ter, but obtained only a re&s;pect|ful letter from thence. They wrote al&s;o to Mr. William Screven in South-Corolina, who had been of this church, but he could not leave his flock there. Therefore in 1708, they called Mr. Ellis Callender to be their mini&s;ter, who had been a member of their church ever &s;ince 1669, and he continued in high e&s;teem among them until 1726.</P>
<P N="3">III. His &s;on, Mr. Eli&s;ha Callender, was wrought upon by divine grace very early, and joined to that church on Augu&s;t 10, 1713; and he was educated in the univer&s;ity at Cambridge, and was ordained a pa&s;tor of that church, May 21, 1718, by the help of three Congregational mini&s;ters in Bo&s;ton, before named. And this tran&s;action, with his corre&s;pond|ence with friends in England, and other informa|tion, moved Thomas Hollis, e&s;quire, of London, to become the greate&s;t benefactor to the univer&s;ity at Cambridge of any one man in the world. Mr. Eli&s;ha Callender was a very faithful and &s;ucce&s;sful mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel, until he fell a&s;leep in Je&s;us, March 31, 1738. Mr. Jeremy Condy was educated in the college at Cambridge, where he took his fir&s;t degree in 1726; after which he went over to England, from whence he was called by this church, and was ordained their pa&s;tor, February 14, 1739. But he had quite other &s;entiments, concerning the nature and power of the
<PB N="125" REF="030011_0124_0FE3BE5BE4AE2EB8">go&s;pel, than tho&s;e of his predece&s;&s;ors; and he oppo&s;ed the powerful work which came on in Bo&s;ton the year after he was ordained, and another church was formed in a way of &s;eparation from him; and the fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church in Bo&s;ton was in a declining condition, until they called and &s;ettled Mr. Samuel Stillman as their pa&s;tor, January 9, 1765, when Mr. Condy re&s;igned his office, and lived a retired life, well e&s;teemed among his acquaintance, until he died, Augu&s;t 9, 1768, aged 59. A revival of religion began in that church in 1769, which cau&s;ed the ad|dition of eighty members in three years, to a church which had not &s;eventy members before. The Con|gregational mini&s;ters of Bo&s;ton were much alarmed at this increa&s;e of the Bapti&s;ts, and publi&s;hed &s;everal things to guard again&s;t them, and to draw young people into their own communion. One of them had publi&s;hed a book again&s;t the work of God in 1743, when many were drawing off from uncon|verted mini&s;ters, and then he &s;aid, "No man becomes a mini&s;ter, or a communicant in our churches, until he hath been &s;everely examined about his <HI>regenera|tion,</HI> as well as conver&s;ation." But he publi&s;hed another book in 1772, to guard again&s;t the Bapti&s;ts, in which he &s;aid, "The divinely appointed way, in which per&s;ons become members of the vi&s;ible church of Chri&s;t, is utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;uppo&s;ition, that, in order to their being &s;o, they mu&s;t be the &s;ubjects of <HI>&s;aving faith,</HI> or judged to be &s;o." Our &s;econd vol. p. 153, 269. Thus do men condemn them&s;elves. When the American war began in Bo&s;|ton, this church was much &s;cattered, and their pa&s;tor removed to Philadelphia; and after his return and his brethren, earthly mindedne&s;s greatly prevailed, until the year 1785, when religion was again reviv|ed, which added fifty members more in three years. In 1790, a happy work of the Spirit of God was again granted in Bo&s;ton, and above &s;eventy members
<PB N="126" REF="030011_0125_0FE3BEE122418418">were received into the fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church there, in about two years, and their pre&s;ent number is 267, be&s;ides all that have died, have been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, or excluded.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Another mini&s;ter, who is a member of this church, is not to be forgotten. Mr. Peter Philan|thropos Roots, A. M. was born at Sym&s;bury in Con|necticut, where his father was mini&s;ter,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Benaiah Roots.</NOTE> March 27, 1765. But as many of the people di&s;liked his fa|ther's &s;earching preaching, he reque&s;ted a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, which was granted, and he went and &s;ettled at Rut|land in Vermont, where a happy work of grace was granted in 1783, when his &s;on experienced a change of heart; and he was educated in Dartmouth col|lege, after which he was licen&s;ed to preach in the Congregational way, in March, 1790. He had many &s;cruples about infant bapti&s;m while he was at college, and they followed him afterwards, until he made them known to the mo&s;t able mini&s;ters of his own denomination, de&s;iring them to &s;hew him a divine warrant for that practice, if they could, as he had no de&s;ire to become a Bapti&s;t, if he could avoid it with a clear con&s;cience. But as they could not &s;atisfy him, and he obtained full conviction, that a credible profe&s;&s;ion of &s;aving faith was a nece&s;&s;ary qualification for bapti&s;m, he came to Bo&s;ton, and was baptized and joined to the fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church there, June 3, 1792. And the church being &s;atisfied with his qual|ifications for an itinerant mini&s;ter, called others to a&s;&s;i&s;t in his ordination at Providence, September 4, 1792, the day before the commencement at the uni|ver&s;ity there; and in the winter following he travel|led and preached the go&s;pel through all the States as far as Georgia. And Mr. Roots has devoted him&s;elf to the work ever &s;ince, often preaching to de&s;titute churches in various parts of our country, and he hath been received to preach in the pulpits
<PB N="127" REF="030011_0126_0FE3BF30806E5A00">of many Congregational mini&s;ters, as well as in places where no &s;teady wor&s;hip had been maintained; and as inquiry was often made, why he embraced the Bapti&s;t principles, he publi&s;hed a book to give the rea&s;ons thereof near the clo&s;e of 1794.</P>
<P N="5">V. As the &s;econd Bapti&s;t church in Bo&s;ton began in a way of &s;eparation from the fir&s;t, they gave them the following rea&s;ons for it.
<LETTER>
<LIST>
<ITEM>"1. We have for a con&s;iderable time been di&s;&s;atisfied with Mr. Condy's doctrine, being of opinion, from many di&s;cour&s;es which we have heard him deliver from the pulpit, and from conver&s;ation with him at &s;everal times, that he is what we call an Arminian, in that we appre|hend he holds general redemption, is a free-willer, holds to falling from grace, and denies original &s;in. We mean by his denying original &s;in, that he &s;oftens, moderates and explains away the guilt, malignity, corruption and depravity of human nature exactly as the high Arminian clergy forever do.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. We con|ceive that he denies the doctrines of election and prede&s;tination. If Mr. Condy does not deny the&s;e doctrines, we freely confe&s;s that we do not under|&s;tand the &s;cope or de&s;ign of his &s;ermons, nor of his conver&s;ation when we have heard him di&s;cour&s;e on the&s;e points of our faith. He publickly owned at a church meeting, that he never had preached election, and believed he never &s;hould; alleging as a rea&s;on for it, that if he &s;hould preach up election, he &s;hould offend the greater part of his church. This excu&s;e we look upon to be no &s;ufficient rea&s;on for his de|clining to in&s;truct his people in this important doc|trine, but it rather ought to have animated him, if he believed this doctrine him&s;elf, to &s;et his church right in an article of &s;uch importance. We hope we need not take up your time nor our own in prov|ing, that it is the indi&s;pen&s;able duty of a faithful mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, to declare to his church the whole coun&s;el of God, let who will be offended thereat;
<PB N="128" REF="030011_0127_0FE3BEE737CF1818">&s;o that we conclude that Mr. Condy does not believe the doctrine of election him&s;elf.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. We are enough di&s;&s;atisfied with his way of thinking on that great, that mo&s;t &s;olemn doctrine of regeneration. When|ever we have heard him di&s;cour&s;e on the new-birth, his &s;ermons were &s;o ill grounded, &s;o intermixed with man's freewill agency, and &s;o widely different from what our Lord taught and intended thereby, that we cannot avoid que&s;tioning whether he ever experien|ced the &s;aving operation of that mo&s;t important doc|trine in his own &s;oul.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. We were &s;ufficiently af|frighted at a declaration in one of his &s;ermons, That Chri&s;tians cannot know or di&s;tingui&s;h the operation of the Spirit of God upon their &s;ouls, from the ope|rations of their own minds. This a&s;&s;ertion we look upon to be of the mo&s;t dangerous tendency; a &s;trik|ing at the root and main evidence of the Chri&s;tian con&s;olation and hope.&mdash;We are now willing to re|turn to our former places with you, if we can find that your principles and practices are the &s;ame with tho&s;e on which, by the grace of God, our church was fir&s;t founded. But if your articles of faith are in fact contrary to tho&s;e on which this church was fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed, you cannot, we think, ju&s;tly blame us for &s;eparating from you, and uniting with others who are like minded with our&s;elves. The Lord give you under&s;tanding in all things, and may your hearts be directed into the love of God, and to be ready always to give an account of the hope that is in you, with meekne&s;s and fear. The grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t be with you all.</ITEM>

<P N="6">VI. The two fir&s;t of the&s;e men came formerly from England, the third from Wales, and the fourth was a &s;chool ma&s;ter in Bo&s;ton. Mr. Ephraim Bound,
<PB N="129" REF="030011_0128_0FE3BF3645451B18">&s;on to James, met with a happy change in tho&s;e times, and was baptized by elder Moulton, of Brim|field, and he began to preach the go&s;pel in this new &s;ociety. And as they obtained no &s;atisfaction from the old church, James Bound, John Procter, Ephraim Bo&s;worth, John Dabney, Thomas Boucher, Ephraim Bound, and Thomas Lewis, formed a new church in Bo&s;ton, July 27, 1743, and elected Ephraim Bound as their pa&s;tor. His human learning was not great, but his powers of mind, and his &s;piritual teaching, made him an excellent teacher and mini|&s;ter of the go&s;pel. But as mo&s;t of the old Bapti&s;t mini&s;ters and churches in our country were prejudi|ced again&s;t the late revival of religion therein, the&s;e people found it difficult to obtain help in the ordi|nation of their mini&s;ter. Elder Wightman, of Gro|ton in Connecticut, was clear in that work, but he was advanced in years, and could not well travel &s;o far as Bo&s;ton; therefore this church &s;ent &s;ome of their members to meet him in Warwick, where Mr. Bound was ordained, September 7, 1743, by the help of elder Wightman, and elder Greene, of Lei|ce&s;ter. And many &s;ubjects of the late work of grace in the land, joined to this church in Bo&s;ton, from Newton, Needham, Medfield, and other places. Deacon Ephraim Bo&s;worth, of the town of Hull, having no children, gave this church a good e&s;tate, which they &s;till enjoy. Al&s;o in the month of Feb|ruary, 1749, this church received the following gen|erous donation from England; viz. From the Rev. John Gill, D. D. for the communion table, one large cup, four &s;maller ones, two di&s;hes and two plates, al&s;o one large rich dama&s;k table cloth. Al&s;o &s;even complete &s;ets of bapti&s;mal garments, namely, one for the mini&s;ter, and three for men and three for wom|en; al&s;o books to the amount of about fifty dol|lars. At the &s;ame time they received a further gift of forty eight volumes of the late Rev. Mr. Hill's
<PB N="130" REF="030011_0129_0FE3BE7CA06F8720">Sermons; (an Independent mini&s;ter in London, &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or to Dr. Ridgley) Mr. Hill's &s;ermons were &s;ent by his father, the editor, to be given away at the di&s;|cretion of the church. And after the great earth|quake in 1755, Mr. Bound &s;et up a weekly lecture, which was attended by many from all parts of the town; "and many owned him to be the in&s;trument of their conver&s;ion, who yet joined to Pedobapti&s;t churches; and he was greatly re&s;pected by people of various denominations, and e&s;pecially by his own &s;ociety. But in the mid&s;t of his u&s;efulne&s;s, it plea&s;|ed God to &s;eize him with a paralytic di&s;order, in the morning of December 17, 1762, from which he never recovered, though he revived &s;o as to preach a few &s;ermons." Mr. Bound died, much lamented, though with great comfort in his own &s;oul, June 18, 1765. This church had increa&s;ed under his mini&s;|try to about 120 members; and as &s;oon as he was taken ill, they not only obtained occa&s;ional &s;upplies from &s;i&s;ter churches, but al&s;o &s;ent for Mr. (now Dr.) Samuel Stillman, from New-Jer&s;ey. He was born in Penn&s;ylvania, and educated in South-Carolina, where he was ordained; but the climate not &s;uiting his con&s;titution, he came and preached for &s;ome time at Bordentown in the Jer&s;ey, from whence he came to Bo&s;ton, and mini&s;tered a year to this church, and then, in September, 1764, he went to the fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church in Bo&s;ton, in which he hath been a &s;ucce&s;sful mini&s;ter to this day.</P>
<P N="7">VII. The &s;econd Bapti&s;t church in Bo&s;ton being again left de&s;titute, &s;ought and obtained &s;ome help from &s;i&s;ter churches, and looked out for another pa&s;tor, but could not obtain one in many years. Many of their old brethren were dead, and others were &s;cattered into different parts of the land, &s;o that they feared a di&s;&s;olution of their church. Such is the changing &s;tate of things in this world, both as to our temporal and &s;piritual concerns; and happy are
<PB N="131" REF="030011_0130_0FE3BE6257C14898">they who humble them&s;elves under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt them in due time. Mr. John Davis paid this church a vi&s;it in the fall of 1769, and at their reque&s;t, he removed there from the State of Delaware in May, and was ordained their pa&s;tor September 9, 1770. He was educated in the college at Philadelphia, and was a man of great powers of mind, which he exerted in a noble manner, in the cau&s;e of religious liberty, and for the welfare of our churches, until his health failed, which led him to a&s;k a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, which was granted, July 19, 1772, and he &s;ailed from Bo&s;ton in Augu&s;t, and di|ed near the Ohio, December 13, 1772, greatly la|mented. Mr. I&s;aac Skillman, who was born in New-Jer&s;ey, and educated at Princeton college, was the third pa&s;tor of this church, from September, 1773, to October, 1787, when he went back to New-Jer|&s;ey, and is now the pa&s;tor of the Bapti&s;t church at Salem in that State. Directly after his departure, this church called Mr. Thomas Gair to be their pa&s;|tor, who was born in Bo&s;ton, educated in the college at Providence, and ordained at Medfield, September 18, 1776, where he mini&s;tered to good purpo&s;e for ten years. But then, as &s;ome of their able&s;t breth|ren were dead, and peculiar difficulties aro&s;e in the church, they di&s;mi&s;&s;ed and recommended him; and his labours were much ble&s;&s;ed in Bo&s;ton, until he was &s;uddenly called away by death, April 27, 1790. And it is very remarkable that two pa&s;tors of this church, Davis and Gair, each died in his 36th year, and were the only mini&s;ters who had died out of the Warren A&s;&s;ociation &s;ince it was formed in 1767. In July after the decea&s;e of the latter, the church ob|tained a vi&s;it from Mr. Thomas Baldwin, who was born at Norwich in Connecticut, December 23, 1753, and ordained at Canaan in New-Hamp&s;hire, June 11, 1783, and preached with &s;ucce&s;s in tho&s;e parts until he was now called to Bo&s;ton, where he
<PB N="132" REF="030011_0131_0FE3BEEC7A941FD0">was in&s;talled the pa&s;tor of this church, November 11, 1790. They had but 42 members when Mr. Skill|man came there in 1773, and when he left them they had increa&s;ed to 66, and when Mr. Gair died they had 89, and now have 158.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. The&s;e churches in Bo&s;ton have equal liber|ties with other denominations, and no man in that town has been compelled to &s;upport any mini&s;ter that he did not per&s;onally choo&s;e, &s;ince the year 1693; but this liberty is <HI>wickedly</HI> denied to the generality of our towns in the country, contrary to the promi&s;e of our delegates at Congre&s;s in 1774. Dr. Stillman preached the election &s;ermon at Bo&s;ton, May 26, 1779, when he clearly de&s;cribed the difference be|tween civil States, and the government of the church of Chri&s;t, &s;hewing that they ought to be entirely di&s;|tinct. Yet in the con&s;titution of our government, which was formed the winter following, church and &s;tate are confounded together. He had publi&s;hed four &s;ermons in 1769, upon original &s;in, the efficacy of divine grace in conver&s;ion, ju&s;tification alone by faith in the perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, and the infinite importance of holy obedience to all the laws of Chri&s;t. This was in the beginning of a happy re|vival of religion in Bo&s;ton. He hath al&s;o publi&s;hed &s;everal other &s;ermons and tracts &s;ince. Mr. Gair pub|li&s;hed an ordination &s;ermon, which he delivered at Cambridge in 1783; and al&s;o a circular letter in the minutes of the Warren A&s;&s;ociation. Mr. Baldwin publi&s;hed a di&s;cour&s;e in 1789, at the reque&s;t of the Wood&s;tock A&s;&s;ociation, to &s;hew the rea&s;ons why the Bapti&s;t churches refu&s;e to commune in the ordi|nance of the &s;upper with any who were only &s;prinkled in infancy. Upwards of two years after, the Rev. Noah Worce&s;ter, of Thornton, (N.H.) publi&s;hed an an&s;wer to him, wherein he &s;et up godly &s;incerity as the rule of communion, and not any external mode of bap|ti&s;m. To this Mr. Baldwin replied, in March, 1794,
<PB N="133" REF="030011_0132_0FE3BF3B31F2D1C8">which was &s;o much e&s;teemed, that it pa&s;&s;ed a &s;econd edition in about two months. He proved plainly, that this controver&s;y all turns upon the&s;e two que&s;tions. 1. Who are the &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m according to the law of Chri&s;t? 2. What is the mode or manner of the bapti&s;m which he hath in&s;tituted? Mr. Wor|ce&s;ter publi&s;hed another piece la&s;t winter, in which he refu&s;ed to meet him upon this ground, &s;aying, "The attempt would be to di&s;&s;olve the di&s;tinction be|tween the two denominations, rather than to open the way for a free communion between us, as two denominations. For I pre&s;ume, that, were we agreed upon the&s;e two que&s;tions, we &s;hould not be two de|nominations."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Worce&s;ter's Di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, p. 8.</NOTE> Very true; and why &s;hould any be unwilling to have but one Lord, one faith, and one bapti&s;m? Yet this author hath now publi&s;hed above an hundred pages upon other things, while he refu&s;ed to come to the point in hand.</P>
<P N="9">IX. Bellingham, in the county of Norfolk, was &s;o abu&s;ively treated by Congregational mini&s;ters, that they have never &s;ettled one of them in that town in above forty years pa&s;t. The Bapti&s;t church there, was con&s;tituted October 15, 1750; and Mr. Elna|than Wight was their fir&s;t pa&s;tor, who was ordained January 14, 1755, and was a faithful and u&s;eful min|i&s;ter there, until he was taken away by death, No|vember 6, 1761, aged 46. Mr. Noah Alden was born in Middleborough, May 31, 1725, converted there in 1741, and was ordained at Stafford in Con|necticut, June 5, 1755. But he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from thence, by the advice of a council, Augu&s;t 28, 1765, and he was in&s;talled at Bellingham, November 12, 1766, and continues their pa&s;tor to this day. Mr. Aaron Leland was rai&s;ed up in this church, who is pa&s;tor of the Bapti&s;t church at Che&s;ter, in Vermont. Peace hath generally been enjoyed in Bellingham, and they have been favoured with &s;everal revivals of
<PB N="134" REF="030011_0133_0FE3BE57377F5238">religion, though their church hath never been very large. And the like may be &s;aid of the Bapti&s;t church in Wrentham, which was con&s;tituted in 1769. William Williams, A. M. was ordained their pa&s;tor, July 3, 1776. He was born in Penn&s;ylvania, and was educated in Rhode-I&s;land college, being one of the fir&s;t cla&s;s therein, and he is now a fellow of that cor|poration. He al&s;o keeps a Latin &s;chool, in which many young gentlemen have been fitted for the col|lege. The Bapti&s;t church in Medfield was formed Augu&s;t 18, 1776, and Mr. Gair was ordained the pa&s;tor the next month, as was before ob&s;erved. In 1787 their church had increa&s;ed to 81 members; but in 1789 they di&s;mi&s;&s;ed 14 members to for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> church in We&s;ton. Mr. Edward Clarke removed to Medfield &s;oon after, and hath preached there ever &s;ince, though he is not ordained. He &s;prang from the family who were fathers of the fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church in Newport, which was formed in 1644; and he hath publi&s;hed a reply to Me&s;&s;rs. Fi&s;h and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> upon bapti&s;m, and &s;ome other things. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Bapti&s;t church in the county of Norfolk was formed Augu&s;t 24, 1780, upon the borders of Stough<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> and Braintree, where now is the town of Rand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> Former revivals of religion had been granted th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, but the work was more powerful in that glo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> year 1780. Joel Briggs, A. M. was born in No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> April 15, 1757, educated in the college at Provi|dence, and preached to this church about three years, before he was ordained their pa&s;tor, December 5, 1787. A powerful work was again wrought among them in 1790, which cau&s;ed the addition of above twenty members to this church: and it extended its happy influence into Bridgwater and Abington.</P>
<P N="10">X. The county of Plymouth, where our fathers began the &s;ettlement of New-England, calls for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> next attention. The principles and manners of the fir&s;t planters of the country, are as much retained
<PB N="135" REF="030011_0134_0FE3BE66EDC1B308">here as in any part of the land. And this may be a cau&s;e why no per&s;on hath been hanged in the county of Plymouth for &s;ixty years pa&s;t. The inhab|itants are as much upon a level, and there are as few foreigners among them, as in any part of America. The people are generally &s;upported by their own la|bours, and not by the labour of others. And a powerful work of the Spirit of God in Middleborough, in and after 1741, prepared the way for the gather|ing of the fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church in the county, in this town. After the death of their mini&s;ter in April, 1744, Judge Oliver, who came from Bo&s;ton, with a few more leading men in Middleborough, &s;hut the next mini&s;ter whom the church cho&s;e, and two thirds of the people, out of their meeting-hou&s;e, and from the u&s;e of their mini&s;terial lands. And when a new precinct was con&s;tituted in February, 1743, con&s;i&s;ting part of Middleborough, and part of Bridgwater, the communicants therein were denied a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from the old churches for five years, le&s;t if a church were formed in this precinct, they &s;hould call a mini&s;ter whom the world did not like. The communicants therefore &s;et up a meeting without li|cen&s;e from arbitrary mini&s;ters, in December, 1747, and formed a church here, February 16, 1748, and ordained a pa&s;tor therein the 13th of April follow|ing. But in the month between, their opponents held a pari&s;h meeting, and voted a large &s;um of money, to fini&s;h their meeting-hou&s;e, and to hire other &s;ort of preaching, and taxed the church and their mini&s;ter, with the re&s;t of the inhabitants, to pay it. But after di&s;tre&s;s had been made upon &s;everal of them, it appeared in a trial at Plymouth court, that &s;aid money was voted at an illegal meeting, and the ca&s;e was turned again&s;t their collector. But they ap|pealed to their &s;uperior court, and in the mean time &s;ent an agent to Bo&s;ton, and obtained an act of the legi&s;lature to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;aid meeting as legal, and the
<PB N="136" REF="030011_0135_0FE3BE81F17A13A0">&s;uperior court gave judgment again&s;t the defendant upon this act, which was pa&s;&s;ed after the &s;uit was commenced in the fir&s;t executive court. And this &s;hews that the temporal intere&s;t of no people can be &s;ecure, where one party of mini&s;ters are &s;upported by tax and compul&s;ion.</P>
<P N="11">XI. In Augu&s;t, 1749, a di&s;pute about bapti&s;m was brought into this church, which was managed with an unhappy temper by many, and cau&s;ed great diffi|culties among the people. Nine members of this church, and one who was not a member, were bap|tized in September, and they &s;et up a meeting from the church in October, becau&s;e their mini&s;ter and church did not immediately become Bapti&s;ts, &s;o as to obtain an exemption from taxes to Congregational mini&s;ters. They went the next year and joined to old Bapti&s;t churches, and obtained &s;uch an exemp|tion. The&s;e things, with the unhappy temper which many di&s;covered, cau&s;ed a great fear in others that there was &s;ome &s;ecret iniquity in the Bapti&s;t principles, as tradition had long &s;aid there was. But they were led by degrees, to di&s;tingui&s;h between the truth of God, and the corruptions of men who profe&s;s a zeal for it; and their mini&s;ter was bap|tized in Augu&s;t, 1751, and others afterwards, who yet held communion with tho&s;e who were only &s;prinkled in infancy, until they were convinced that this was a practical &s;aying that they were baptized when they believed in their con&s;ciences they were not. Therefore they formed a Bapti&s;t church here, January 16, 1756, and their former mini&s;ter was in|&s;talled their pa&s;tor the 23d of June following, in which office he is &s;till continued. He was born at Norwich in Connecticut, January 9, 1724, convert|ed in 1741, and began to preach in September, 1746. This was then the only Bapti&s;t church in an extent of country of above an hundred miles long, from Bellingham to the end of Cape-Cod, and near fifty
<PB N="137" REF="030011_0136_0FE3BE8809E19250">miles wide, between Bo&s;ton and Rehoboth. Their number was &s;mall for many years, though they had &s;ome revivings from time to time, until &s;uch a work came on in 1779, as increa&s;ed their number in three years, from 59 to 138. And in forty years they have buried 34, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed 61, and excluded 12, while 91 remain. Seven members of this church have been ordained to the work of the go&s;pel mini&s;try, namely, James Mellen, Abner Lewis, A&s;a Hunt, Eli|jah Codding, Job Macomber, Samuel Nel&s;on, and David Leonard; the la&s;t of whom was ordained as an itinerant, December 17, 1794. He was born in Bridgwater, and educated at the college in Provi|dence, where he took his fir&s;t degree in 1792. His brother Zenas Lockwood Leonard graduated at that college in 1794, and was &s;oon approbated by this church to preach the go&s;pel, and has been accepted in that work in various parts of the country. Ste|phen Smith Nel&s;on was a cla&s;s-mate with him, and he was approbated as a go&s;pel preacher by this church la&s;t May. He is great-grand&s;on to the fir&s;t Bapti&s;t in Middleborough, of whom we &s;hall &s;ay more pre&s;ently. The pa&s;tor of this church publi&s;hed a di&s;cour&s;e upon an internal call to preach the go&s;|pel, in 1754; and he has publi&s;hed the mo&s;t &s;ince of any Bapti&s;t in America; but their value is left entirely to the judgment of the public.</P>
<P N="12">XII. The &s;econd Bapti&s;t church in Middleborough was formed in the following manner. Thomas Nel&s;on, who was born here in June, 1675, di&s;covered &s;uch evils in the &s;econd mini&s;ter of the town, as cau&s;|ed him to examine the &s;criptures concerning their principles; and finding nothing therein for infant bapti&s;m, he went and joined to the fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church in Swan&s;ea. And in the year 1717 he re|moved into the &s;outh part of Middleborough, called A&s;&s;awam&s;et, being the fir&s;t Engli&s;h family who &s;ettled there. And Bapti&s;t mini&s;ters frequently preached at
<PB N="138" REF="030011_0137_0FE3BEEFE3F78CD0">his hou&s;e, until he got one to preach there &s;teadily, in the &s;pring of 1753. This was Mr. Ebenezer Hinds, who was born in Bridgwater, July 29, 1719, and began to preach in 1749. About four miles &s;outh we&s;tward from this meeting, in a place called Beechwoods, Mr. James Mead was ordained the pa&s;|tor of a &s;eparate church, October 3, 1751, and contin|ued in that office until he died, October 2, 1756. The majority of that church became Bapti&s;ts &s;oon after, and joined with Mr. Hinds's hearers in forming a Bapti&s;t church, November 16, 1757, and he was ordained their pa&s;tor, January 26, 1758.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Hinds was baptized by Mr. E. Moulton, and joined him&s;elf to the &s;econd Bapti&s;t church in Bo&s;ton, March 3, 1751.</NOTE> They purcha&s;ed a hou&s;e and farm for the mini&s;try, and built a convenient meeting-hou&s;e 42 miles from Bo&s;|ton. Mr. Nel&s;on died before this church was con&s;ti|tuted, aged eighty, but his widow lived to commune with them in the ordinance of the &s;upper, after &s;he was an hundred years old. She died December 7, 1782, being an hundred and five years and &s;even months old; and &s;he had then living of her po&s;terity 337, as near as the account could be collected; for &s;ome of them were in Nova-Scotia. William, Sam|uel and Ebenezer Nel&s;on, three of her grand&s;ons, are now ordained Bapti&s;t mini&s;ters. Mr. Hathway, a mini&s;ter in Freetown, al&s;o &s;prang from this church. Such a revival of religion was granted among them in 1773, as increa&s;ed the church to 104 members the next year. But a number of them were di&s;mi&s;&s;|ed to form a church in Freetown &s;oon after, and they never have been &s;o large &s;ince. Mr. Hinds hath had two wives, and fifteen children, of whom he hath buried eight; and the great expen&s;es in his family, with different &s;entiments about the &s;upport of mini&s;|ters, and the government of the church, hath cau&s;ed many contentions among them, which hath reduced the church to a much &s;maller number than they once had; yet he is &s;till continued in his office there.</P>
<P N="13"><PB N="139" REF="030011_0138_0FE3BF3F1586C9B8">
XIII. The third Bapti&s;t church in Middleborough &s;prang chiefly from the fir&s;t. The lands near the cor|ners of Middleborough, Roche&s;ter, Wareham, and Carver, were but little cultivated until 1754; and Bapti&s;t mini&s;ters were called to preach there from time to time afterwards, and per&s;ons from thence joined to our church, until they obtained a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, and ten per&s;ons were formed into a church there, Au|gu&s;t 4, 1761. Mr. Ebenezer Jones had preached to them for a while before, and he was ordained their pa&s;|tor the 28th of October following. And a revival of religion came on among them the next &s;pring, which prevailed through the year, and &s;pread its happy in|fluence into many other &s;ocieties, the good fruits whereof are vi&s;ible to this day. Yet &s;ome evil beha|viour in Mr. Jones's wife, which drew him into a &s;nare, cau&s;ed a great divi&s;ion in the church and &s;o|ciety in 1763, which terminated in his removal from them; and he travelled and preached in various parts of our land, until he died in the county of Al|bany, in September, 1791. This church was in a furnace of affliction for &s;everal years; but in the &s;pring of 1770, they obtained Mr. A&s;a Hunt to preach to them, and he was ordained their pa&s;tor, October 30, 1771. He was born in Braintree, in July, 1744, and preached in Raynham for a year before he went to them, when he joined to the fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church in Middleborough. His preaching was very acceptable, and they gave him a good place for a &s;ettlement, be&s;ide the u&s;e of the mini&s;terial lot; and they built a convenient meeting-hou&s;e, above eleven miles from the fir&s;t Bapti&s;t meeting in this town. And &s;uch a work of the Spirit of God began among them in March, 1780, as cau&s;ed the addition of 113 members to their church by September, 1782, when they had 194 in all. But in the time of great changes in our country about money and worldly property, Mr. Hunt entangled him&s;elf &s;o much in
<PB N="140" REF="030011_0139_0FE3BEF593945048">the affairs of this life, as cau&s;ed much unhappine&s;s, and he in&s;i&s;ted upon a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from his church, which they granted, though with reluctance, in De|cember, 1789. He had been a journey into Virgin|ia, where he preached to good purpo&s;e the year be|fore, and he travelled into New-Jer&s;ey and Penn&s;ylva|nia after his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion; but he never removed his family, until he was called to vi&s;it his elde&s;t &s;on, who was &s;ick with the dy&s;entery in the college at Provi|dence, where the father was &s;eized with the &s;ame di&s;temper, and died there, September 20, 1791. His &s;on recovered, while he was taken away, and his memory is precious to many, notwith&s;tanding his im|perfections. The church was in low circum&s;tances for &s;ome time, and young people got to be &s;o extrav|agant in vanity, that they could hardly be kept civil in times of public wor&s;hip. But the church pre|vailed with Mr. Samuel Nel&s;on to remove there to preach to them, in May, 1793. And in the begin|ning of the next month, &s;uch a divine influence was granted, that old Chri&s;tians became all alive in re|ligion, and &s;uch a concern for the &s;oul and eternity appeared among old and young through all the bu&s;i|e&s;t time in the &s;ummer, that they had frequent and crouded meetings, in &s;ea&s;on and out of &s;ea&s;on, with|out the lea&s;t di&s;turbance from vain per&s;ons, which before were &s;o trouble&s;ome. Mr. Nel&s;on was or|dained their pa&s;tor January 16, 1794; and above thirty were added to their church in about a year. He was born in this town April 6, 1745, and is &s;till u&s;eful in this church. Mr. John Tripp, and Mr. Simeon Coombs have been of this church, who are now ordained mini&s;ters in other places.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. A few per&s;ons in the we&s;t part of Bridg|water had been members of the fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church in Middleborough near thirty years, before a happy revival of religion began there in 1779, when their number increa&s;ed &s;o much that they were encourag|ed to hold meetings among them&s;elves, from time to
<PB N="141" REF="030011_0140_0FE3BF4461103008">time, until &s;ixteen members were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and a church was formed there, June 7, 1785. Mr. George Robin&s;on had preached to them for a year before, and he became their pa&s;tor. He was born in Attleborough, in November, 1754, and was ordain|ed at Killingly in Connecticut, November 13, 1776, where he mini&s;tered for more than &s;even years. But &s;uch difficulties then aro&s;e in their church, partly occa&s;ioned by the public di&s;orders in our country, that they called a council, and, by their advice, di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed and recommended him, and he removed to Bridgwater, where many ble&s;&s;ings have been grant|ed under his mini&s;try. Mr. Seth Howard was bap|tized there, March 10, 1779, and was one of the fir&s;t members of this church, and he continued in their communion, until he died in a joyful manner, October 11, 1794, aged near 92. Mr. Eleazar Snow, who was born in Bridgwater, July 25, 1701, al&s;o joined to the fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church in Middlebo|rough, and was then one of the fir&s;t members of this church, and is now the olde&s;t man in Bridgwater.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. SNOW, full of divine con&s;olation, died Feb. 18, 1796.</NOTE></P>
<P N="15">XV. Some per&s;ons of Mar&s;hfield joined to the fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church in Bo&s;ton, before elder Callender died in 1738, and others joined to their &s;econd church in elder Bound's time; but their number was &s;mall, until deacon Jo&s;iah Eames invited Bapti&s;t mini&s;ters to preach there in 1773, and a meeting was &s;et up, in which Thomas Eames began to preach. But the&s;e men removed away, and the la&s;t of them is now pa&s;tor of a church in I&s;le&s;borough in the coun|ty of Hancock; and the Bapti&s;ts in Mar&s;hfield were in low circum&s;tances, until a revival was granted in 1786, and they built them a meeting-hou&s;e the next year, and a church was formed among them, June 11, 1788. They received a&s;&s;i&s;tance from neigh|bouring mini&s;ters, from time to time, until Mr. Jo|&s;eph Butterfield came to preach there &s;teadily in the fall of 1791, and he was ordained their pa&s;tor, May 16, 1792. His gifts were promi&s;ing, and his hear|ers
<PB N="142" REF="030011_0141_0FE3BF6E4F07D6E0">increa&s;ed for &s;ome time; but from imprudent con|duct, he proceeded to the u&s;e of deceitful means to ob|tain a temporal living. Therefore a mutual council was called, May 8, 1793, who advi&s;ed the church to depo&s;e him from his office, which they did, and he confe&s;&s;ed it to be ju&s;t. He was then forgiven and re&s;tored as a brother, and recommended to another church, and he removed to We&s;ton, and lately into the di&s;trict of Maine. They have experienced many trying things &s;ince at Mar&s;hfield, but it is hoped that all will work for their &s;piritual good.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. The town of Carver was formerly the &s;outh pari&s;h in Plymton, betwixt Middleborough and Plymouth. Their fir&s;t meeting-hou&s;e was built near the north end of the pari&s;h, becau&s;e mo&s;t of the peo|ple lived there. But when the &s;outh end was al&s;o planted and cultivated, the inhabitants claimed a right of having it removed into the centre; and be|cau&s;e this was denied them, they built another meet|ing-hou&s;e towards the &s;outh end, and obtained occa|&s;ional preaching in it for &s;ome years. At length they got Bapti&s;t mini&s;ters to preach there, and their prin|ciples prevailed, until a Bapti&s;t church was formed there, July 13, 1791, and Mr. John Tripp was or|dained their pa&s;tor the 28th of September following. Mo&s;t of the fir&s;t members were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the third Bapti&s;t church in Middleborough, as others have been &s;ince. And a happy revival of religion in both churches in 1793, cau&s;ed a large increa&s;e of this church. Mr. Tripp preached an ordination &s;ermon at Barn&s;table, April 29, 1795: which was printed &s;oon after at Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>In January, 1793, a great revival of religion began in Plymouth, the fir&s;t town that was planted in New-England; and it prevailed to a greater de|gree than any work of the Spirit of God hath done there &s;ince the year 1742. Their mini&s;ter, the Rev. Dr. Robbins, was much engaged in it, and in the &s;ummer of 1794, he baptized one woman by immer|&s;ion, which was a new thing in that town.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">I. THE fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts is in Swan&s;ea, which was originally in Plymouth colo|ny, the fir&s;t in New-England. Mr. John Miles was a father of the Bapti&s;t churches in Wales, which be|gan in 1649; and he was pa&s;tor of the Bapti&s;t church of Swan&s;ea in that country, until he was ejected from thence by a cruel act of parliament, which turned above two thou&s;and teachers out of their places in 1662. He then came over to our country, and brought their book of records with him, which is in Swan&s;ea to this day, containing many things concerning the fir&s;t Bapti&s;t churches in Wales, that are no where el&s;e to be found, and which have been lately tran&s;cribed and &s;ent over to them. Nicholas Tanner, Obadiah Bowen, John Thomas, and others, al&s;o came over to this country; and one of Bowen's po&s;terity is now Chancellor of the univer&s;ity at Providence. A Bapti&s;t church was formed in Rehoboth in 1663, and Mr. Miles was their pa&s;tor; and four years after they obtained a grant of the town of Swan&s;ea, from the legi&s;lature at Plymouth; and there have been none but Bapti&s;t churches in that town to this day. Mr. Miles often vi&s;ited and laboured with his brethren at Bo&s;ton, in the time of their &s;ufferings; and he continued the
<PB N="144" REF="030011_0143_0FE3BF4999B3C1F8">faithful pa&s;tor of the church in Swan&s;ea, until he fell a&s;leep there, in a good old age, February <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, 1663. Mr. Samuel Luther had been a repre&s;entative <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Swan&s;ea in their legi&s;lature, and was otherwi&s;e u&s;eful in the town, before he was ordained a pa&s;tor of this church, July 22, 1685, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the elders. Hull and Emblen of Bo&s;ton; and he was much e&s;|teemed at home and abroad, until he died in 1717, and his po&s;terity are numerous to this day. Mr. Ephraim Wheaton, who lived within the bounds of Rehoboth, had been a colleague with him about thirteen years, and he was a faithful and &s;ucce&s;sful mini&s;ter until he died, April 26, 1734, aged 75. He baptized and received fifty members into his church in five years after a revival began in 1718, of which he wrote an account to Mr. Hollis in London. Our &s;econd vol. p. 79. Mr. Samuel Maxwell was or|dained a colleague with him, April 18, 1733; but he was un&s;teady in his &s;entiments, and in 1738, he embraced the opinion of keeping the &s;eventh day of the week as the Sabbath, which cau&s;ed his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from this church. April 15, 1739. Elder Benjamin Herrington, formerly of Narragan&s;et, was their near pa&s;tor, and was in&s;talled in this church, Augu&s;t 18, 1742, and he had a crouded audience for &s;everal years; but then he was accu&s;ed of the &s;in of un|cleanne&s;s, and he went off to Canterbury in Con|necticut, where he preached to a few people, and lived in ob&s;curity to old age. In March, 1748, Mr. Jabez Wood, of Middleborough, was called to preach to this church, and he was ordained their pa&s;tor, Sep|tember 5, 1751. He was grand&s;on to Mr. Thomas Nel&s;on; but as the old gentleman judged that Wood had made u&s;e of unju&s;t and deceitful mea&s;ures to obtain that place, where was a good farm for the mini&s;try, he removed his member&s;hip to the fir&s;t Bap|ti&s;t church in Rehoboth, and others went to other churches; and the fir&s;t church in Swan&s;ea was in a
<PB N="145" REF="030011_0144_0FE3BF5AD9AC4400">declining condition, until elder Wood a&s;ked and re|ceived a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">79, and he removed into Vermont, where he died in 1794. But as the enemy had burnt their meeting-hou&s;e, and hou&s;e for the mini&s;try at Warren, three miles off, in May, 1778, the two churches agreed for the pre&s;ent to meet at Swan&s;ea, and elder Thomp&s;on was received into this church, October 7, 1779, and has been their pa&s;tor ever &s;ince. And &s;uch a rain of righteou&s;ne&s;s was granted there in 1780, as cau&s;ed the addition of above ninety members to that church in two years, and they have had other revivals &s;ince.</P>
<P N="2">II. The &s;econd church in Swan&s;ea was formed upon different principles from the fir&s;t, and they held the laying on of hands upon every member as a term of communion, and did not &s;ing in their public wor|&s;hip. Men who removed from Providence, and from other places, &s;et up wor&s;hip by them&s;elves there about 1680, and continued it until they formed a church, and Mr. Thomas Barnes was ordained their pa&s;tor in 1693; and he was well e&s;teemed in his place, until he died, June 8, 1706. Sam&s;on Ma&s;on was a &s;oldier in Cromwell's army, and he came over to America upon the turn of times in England, and &s;ettled in Rehoboth, and his po&s;terity are now as nu|merous as, perhaps, tho&s;e of any man who came to our country in his day, and they have had the chief lead in this church. His &s;ons were Noah, Sam&s;on, James, John, Samuel, Jo&s;eph, I&s;aac, Pelatiah and Benjamin. James and John went to Bo&s;ton, but &s;ix of the others lived in Rehoboth and Swan&s;ea, until the younge&s;t of the &s;ix was &s;eventy years old. I&s;aac Ma&s;on was ordained a deacon in this church, at the &s;ame time that Barnes was ordained their pa&s;tor, and he lived to January 25, 1742. His brother Jo|&s;eph was ordained their pa&s;tor in July, 1709, and continued &s;o till he died, May 19, 1748. Mr. John Peirce was ordained a colleague with him, October
<PB N="146" REF="030011_0145_0FE3BF4E79F478B8">19, 1715, and died September 8, 1750, being each of them near ninety, and their memory is precious to their po&s;terity. Mr. Pelatiah Ma&s;on was born in March, 1669, and died in March, 1763, and three of his &s;ons have been pa&s;tors of this church. Elder Job Ma&s;on was born February 28, 1695, ordained May 22, 1738, and died July 17, 1775. His character as a judicious man, a good preacher, and an exemplary walker, was high among his ac|quaintance. Elder Ru&s;&s;el Ma&s;on was born April 22, 1714, ordained November 2, 1752, and is now able to preach frequently, and to di&s;charge other duties of his office to the acceptance of his brethren. Elder John Ma&s;on was born in Octo|ber, 1716, ordained March 26, 1788, and is well e&s;teemed in his office. In the mean time, as their church has greatly increa&s;ed in latter years, and they had many who joined to it from di&s;tant places, and gifted men were rai&s;ed up among them, they ordained many elders. Elder Benjamin Ma&s;on was ordained September 15, 1784, elder Nathaniel Cole, December 12, 1787, and elder Philip Slade, October 15, 1788. Elder Cole is now &s;ettled in Connecticut, while the others remain in this church in Swan&s;ea. It is al&s;o to be ob&s;erved, that a church in Re|hoboth &s;prang from this church in 1753, and a large part of another church ten years after to go to Nova-Scotia. When all North-America was ced|ed to Great-Britain, Nathan Ma&s;on and his wife, Tho|mas Lewis and his wife, Oliver Ma&s;on and his wife, with Experience Baker, of this church, and Benjamin Ma&s;on and his wife, Charles Seamans and his wife, Gilbert Seamans and his wife, from other churches, were formed into a church, and Nathan Ma&s;on was ordained their pa&s;tor, April 21, 1763, and they went and &s;ettled at the head of the Bay of Fundy. But after &s;ome years they removed back to New-England, and mo&s;t of them went and &s;ettled in Berk&s;hire in
<PB N="147" REF="030011_0146_0FE3BF6B1974F7C0">the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. It is al&s;o to be ob&s;erved, that the powerful work of grace which was wrought in this country, under the mini&s;try of men who held to in|fant bapti&s;m, and who had oppre&s;&s;ed the Bapti&s;ts, was attended with &s;uch evil reports as prejudiced the Bap|ti&s;ts again&s;t the work for many years. But &s;ome mini&s;ters from New-Jer&s;ey came and preached among the Bapti&s;ts in the&s;e parts, in and after 1754, which &s;erved to remove tho&s;e prejudices, in &s;ome mea&s;ure. And in 1756, colonel Andrew Cole, of Swan&s;ea, in|vited &s;ome of our new mini&s;ters to preach at his hou&s;e, and from time to time afterwards. And though the&s;e Bapti&s;t churches had received members by a general confe&s;&s;ion of their faith, yet in a great revival which began in the fall of 1771, a particular relation of experiences of an inward change of heart was introduced, which produced powerful effects upon many. Several hundred per&s;ons were added to the Bapti&s;t churches in Swan&s;ea and Rehoboth within two years after. The work was &s;till greater in and after 1780, and &s;inging in public wor&s;hip was &s;oon after introduced into the &s;econd church in Swan|&s;ea. But as they &s;till held laying on of hands as a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">m of communion, a number drew off, and formed another church, and ordained Mr. Michael Eddy as their pa&s;tor, in Augu&s;t, 1785; though it is &s;ince di&s;&s;olved, and he removed to Newport in 1790, where he is &s;till u&s;eful.</P>
<P N="3">III. Rehoboth is a large town, extending from Taunton and Dighton to Providence, about twelve miles; and in 1791, there were 4710 per&s;ons there|in, and ten religious &s;ocieties, which is more than we have in any other town of their numbers in the&s;e parts. Cruel oppre&s;&s;ion, on the one hand, and an abu&s;e of liberty, on the other, have been the cau&s;e of it. Many had joined with the Bapti&s;ts in Swan&s;ea, from time to time, until Mr. John Comer came and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in forming a church in Rehoboth. Some
<PB N="148" REF="030011_0147_0FE3BF51DC6F57B8">account of him is in our &s;econd volume, p. 66, 110&mdash;113, 121&mdash;124. He was an excellent preacher of the go&s;pel, and an eminent in&s;trument of reviving doctrinal and practical religion in Newport, for &s;ix years before he removed to Rehoboth in Augu&s;t, 1731, and a Bapti&s;t church was formed there, Jan|uary 20, 1732, and he became their pa&s;tor, and it increa&s;ed to 95 members in le&s;s than two years. And in that time he went and laboured in Sutton, Leice&s;ter, Middleborough, and other places. But he exerted his powers &s;o much in this noble cau&s;e, that he fell into a con&s;umption, and died joyfully, May 23, 1734, before he was thirty years old. His &s;on is now a member of the Bapti&s;t church in War|ren, and he lent me his father's diary, and other writings, which have been very &s;erviceable in our hi&s;tory. Nathaniel Millard was ordained the ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> mini&s;ter of this church, June 24, 1736. But his principles and conduct were corrupt, and he w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> di&s;mi&s;&s;ed in 1742, after which he went off with an|other woman in&s;tead of his wife. And as Mr. Mar|well had retracted his opinion concerning the &s;ab|bath, this church called him to be their pa&s;tor, in October, 1745. But in about three years, Congre|gational mini&s;ters, who had oppre&s;&s;ed the Bapti&s;ts, had invited him to preach for them, and he yielded &s;o much to them that this church di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him, and he publi&s;hed a complaint about it in 1749. He oft|en preached in other places, and was e&s;teemed as a pious man, and lived to a great age, but never had the charge of any other church. In the mean time, a &s;econd Bapti&s;t church was formed in the northea&s;t part of Rehoboth, and Mr. Richard Round was or|dained their pa&s;tor, July 13, 1743; and in nine years it increa&s;ed to forty members. He was one of the &s;eals of Mr. Comer's mini&s;try, and preached the go&s;pel faithfully, until his health failed, and he re|moved to the &s;outh part of the town, for the benefit
<PB N="149" REF="030011_0148_0FE3BF660E4AEF80">of the &s;ea air. And about that time a divi&s;ion took place in both churches, and a part of both joined to|gether at their fir&s;t place of wor&s;hip, and elder Round was their pa&s;tor until he died, May 18, 1768, aged 62. His character as a mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel, and as a pious man, was very good; but tho&s;e churches are &s;ince di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Mr. John Hicks was born in Rehoboth, May 10, 1712, and became a member of the fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church there, and then a preacher therein, until they gave him a call to be their pa&s;tor; but he did not accept it, becau&s;e many of the church appeared to him to be un&s;ound in principle, and to oppo&s;e the power of godline&s;s. But after much labour, a new church was formed, and Mr. Hicks was ordained their pa&s;tor, November 10, 1762; and in the glo|rious year 1780, they had 106 members. Mr. Na|thaniel Round, brother to Richard, was a member of this church, and called to preach the go&s;pel there|in; and on May 11, 1768, he was ordained as a mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel, to go and labour in Nova-Scotia, with a people who went from the&s;e parts. He went accordingly, and was a &s;ucce&s;sful labourer there for &s;everal years, and then he removed back, and &s;ettled in the ea&s;t part of Attleborough, and preached occa&s;ionally round the country, until he died at home, July 18, 1781, in the 64th year of his age. Another church was rai&s;ed out of the other, in the following manner. A powerful work began among them in the fall of 1771, and elder Hicks baptized forty per&s;ons, and then was taken &s;ick in the winter, and Mr. Winche&s;ter came and baptized twenty more; and &s;uch power appeared to attend his mini&s;try, that many were taken with the opinion, that bapti&s;m by immer&s;ion ought not to be held as a term of communion in the church. A council was called upon it, in September, 1772, and they who were not convinced by them, formed another church,
<PB N="150" REF="030011_0149_0FE3BF6044936AD0">and ordained Mr. Jacob Hicks as their pa&s;tor, Jan|uary 20, 1773. He is the elde&s;t &s;on of their old pa&s;tor, and was born January 1, 1740 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> vi&s;ion cau&s;ed much unhappine&s;s for many years, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> both &s;ocieties have u&s;ually held their wor&s;hip to|gether in late times, and they now meet in the &s;ame hou&s;e that was fir&s;t built for Mr. Comer's church. Elder John Hicks is now &s;o old and infirm as not to be able to preach, but he appears &s;till &s;tedfa&s;t in the faith and hope of the go&s;pel. His &s;on hath none i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his church at home but tho&s;e who have been buried in bapti&s;m, and &s;eems to have almo&s;t given up occa&s;ional communion with others; and &s;o have other churches, with whom he is connected. For as they communed with tho&s;e who were only &s;prinkled in infancy, becau&s;e they loved them as Chri&s;tians, and not becau&s;e they viewed them as baptized per&s;ons according to the written word, they have found this to be an impediment in the way of enforcing the written word as a rule in other ca&s;es. And to receive any member, to the grief of any al|ready in the church, they al&s;o find to be unwarran|table. Another &s;uch church was formed on the north borders of Rehoboth, after a happy revival of religion there October 2, 1777; and Mr. James Sheldon, of Providence, was ordained their pa&s;tor, September 6, 1780. And he purcha&s;ed a good fare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for &s;ixteen hundred dollars; but after he had paid a thou&s;and of it, he was pre&s;&s;ed upon for the re&s;t, in the trying year 1786, in &s;uch a manner as to compel him to &s;ell it again, with the lo&s;s of about &s;even hundred dollars. And there was rea&s;on to conclude, that a hope of his removal from that people, and of breaking up of that meeting, cau&s;ed the Congrega|tional party to pre&s;s harder in this ca&s;e, than they otherwi&s;e would have done. But be that as it may, elder Sheldon removed his family back to where he had formerly lived, though he often came and mini&s;|tered
<PB N="151" REF="030011_0150_0FE3BFC76934B0D8">to this people for &s;everal years, and then he obtained a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, and removed into the State of New-York in 1792. This church have obtained occa&s;ional &s;upp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, from time to time, until Mr. Jeremiah Irons was ordained their pa&s;tor, Sep|tember 24, 1795. He was born in Glouce&s;ter, above Providence, October 14, 1765. In the ea&s;t part of Rehoboth, a Bapti&s;t church was formed, January 17, 1780, in which were a number of very re&s;pectable members; but as they never obtained a pa&s;tor, they now often go to other meetings. Two Bapti&s;t churches have al&s;o been formed in Rehoboth, who refu&s;ed to commune with any baptized per&s;ons, but tho&s;e who had laying-on of hands and prayer after bapti&s;m. They likewi&s;e excluded &s;inging in their public wor&s;hip, as mo&s;t of the old Bapti&s;ts in New-England did, before our great reformation. In order to form the fir&s;t of the&s;e churches, above thirty per&s;ons were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the &s;econd church in Swan&s;ea, and formed a church in Rehoboth, and ordained Mr. Daniel Martin as their pa&s;tor, Februa|ry 8, 1753; and Mr. Nathan Peirce was &s;oon or|dained a colleague with him. Mr. Martin publi&s;hed a di&s;cour&s;e in 1770, again&s;t particular election, and efficacious grace in conver&s;ion. But an an&s;wer to him was publi&s;hed the next year, which was con|vincing to many minds. Elder Martin died in an advanced age, November 17, 1781, and elder Peirce died in 1794. Elder Thomas Seamans had been a col|league with him for a number of years, and he &s;till mini&s;ters to that people, but their number is &s;mall. Another church &s;prang from them, in the northea&s;t corner of Rehoboth, and was formed on April 4, and two elders were ordained therein April 20, 1789, viz. the elders Aaron Wheeler and Sylve&s;ter Round. The doctrines of grace, and the power of godline&s;s, have lately gained ground among them.</P>

V. Mr. Elhanan Winche&s;ter was born in Brook|lyne, near Bo&s;ton, September 19, 1751, and was very &s;tudious from a child; and he obtained a con|&s;iderable mea&s;ure of human learning, before he made a profe&s;&s;ion of religion, was baptized, and began to preach with much zeal. And his preaching in Re|hoboth cau&s;ed a &s;eparation in Mr. Peck's church, and another church was formed, and he was ordain|ed their pa&s;tor, September 4, 177<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, before he was twenty years old. And though he was baptized him&s;elf, yet he was exceeding zealous for the com|munion of all Chri&s;tians together, let them be &s;prink|led in infancy or baptized by immer&s;ion; and as his preaching appeared to be very powerful and &s;ucce&s;s|ful, it cau&s;ed a divi&s;ion in elder Hicks's church be|fore mentioned. But &s;oon after Mr. Winche&s;ter was ordained, a Bapti&s;t mini&s;ter pointed out to him the incon&s;i&s;tency of his conduct in &s;uch a manner, that, after eight months' con&s;ideration, he declared to his church, that he could no more admini&s;ter the ordinance of the &s;upper to any who were only &s;prink|led in infancy, though he was &s;till willing to di&s;|charge all the duties of his office to them that he could do with a good con&s;cience. But upon this the majority of his church refu&s;ed to let him preach another &s;ermon among them; and they &s;oon after cen&s;ured him for not fulfilling his fir&s;t covenant with them. Yet they called their way large communion, and the Bapti&s;t way clo&s;e communion. This church ordained Mr. Jonathan Chaffee as their pa&s;tor, in May, 1778, but their church has decrea&s;ed until it is now nearly di&s;&s;olved. Mr. Winche&s;ter called a council of Bapti&s;t churches in December, 1772, who advi&s;ed him to confe&s;s his imprudent conduct to that church, and then to offer him&s;elf as a member <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ome Bapti&s;t church. He did &s;o, and was received into the church in Bellingham; after which he travelled and laboured abundantly, through all the
<PB N="153" REF="030011_0152_0FE3BFCCE16C1B48">country, as far as South-Carolina. But in the be|ginning of 1781 he was rejected by the Bapti&s;t church in Philadelphia, becau&s;e the fathers of it di&s;covered that he had fallen into the doctrine of univer&s;al &s;al|vation. He had preached there but a few months, but in that time he had admitted many members, by which means his party became the majority; there|fore they &s;ued for the meeting-hou&s;e, and the hou&s;e for the mini&s;try, with other property which belong|ed to that church. Though after much co&s;t in courts, for &s;everal years, they were defeated, and the property &s;ecured to the original church. After this, he came and &s;pent a year in New-England, without vi&s;iting many of his old friends, and then returned to Philadelphia, from whence he &s;ailed for England, in July, 1787. In London he publi&s;hed a book, in which he &s;aid, "I have, at the expen&s;e of character and popularity with <HI>the religious world,</HI> at the haz|ard of <HI>temporal intere&s;t</HI> and emolument, and refu&s;ing no other &s;acrifice, in what I apprehended to be the cau&s;e of God and truth, come forth as a writing witne&s;s on this &s;ubject; and a defender of the faith which once I de&s;troyed."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Preface to Winche&s;ter's Dialogues, 1788, p. 6, 7.</NOTE> Though it is well known, that he concealed his opinion upon that &s;ubject as long as he could, and that he gra&s;ped at the tempo|ral property of &s;aid church as long as he could hope for it. And what is the faith which he would now defend? Why he &s;ays, "<HI>Puni&s;hment,</HI> without having the reformation and &s;ubjection of rebels for its end, is unworthy of the Being we adore." Again he &s;ays, "Since <HI>goodne&s;s</HI> is the perfection of God, and <HI>evil</HI> the imperfection of the creature, there can be no doubt, that as good exi&s;ted before evil, &s;o it &s;hall exi&s;t to all eternity, when evil &s;hall be no more."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dialogues, p. 23, 32, 33.</NOTE> But how can any man believe, that the puni&s;hment which God has inflicted upon the fallen angels, for

Yea, or that the de&s;truction of unbeliev|ers in the wilderne&s;s, or of the Sodomites by fire from heaven, was de&s;igned for their endle&s;s happi|ne&s;s? How can any government or dominion be &s;upported upon the&s;e principles? And as God was infinitely good, before he created angels or men, how do we know that he will not reduce them all back again to nothing? For he created all things good, and the &s;erpent per&s;uaded our fir&s;t mother, that death and ruin could not come from eating the forbidden fruit. And one apo&s;tle &s;ays to Chri&s;tians, I fear le&s;t by any means, as the &s;erpent beguiled Eve through his &s;ubtilty, &s;o your minds &s;hould be cor|rupted from the &s;implicity that is in Chri&s;t. 2. Cor. xi. 3. And another &s;ays, I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord having &s;aved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterwards de&s;troyed them that believed not. And the angels which kept not their fir&s;t e&s;tate, but left their own habitation, he hath re&s;erved in ever|la&s;ting chains under darkne&s;s, unto the judgment of the great day. Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner giving them|&s;elves over to fornication, and going after &s;trange fle&s;h, are &s;et forth for an example, &s;uffering the ven|geance of eternal fire. Likewi&s;e al&s;o the&s;e filthy dreamers defile the fle&s;h, de&s;pi&s;e dominion, and &s;peak evil of dignities. Jude 5&mdash;8. Here our times are exactly de&s;cribed by God, who &s;aw them perfectly &s;eventeen hundred years ago. Yet Winche&s;ter has followed others in denying that the words everla&s;t|ing and eternal, when applied to future mi&s;ery, mean without end. And he &s;ays, "The foundation of <HI>endle&s;s</HI> mi&s;ery, came from the Pagan theology."

<P N="6">VI. And the &s;ame may be &s;aid concerning mini&s;|terial tyranny. An in&s;tance of it was before given, in the &s;elling of their mini&s;terial lands in Rehoboth, and obtaining an act to incorporate the committees who &s;hould be annually cho&s;en in each pari&s;h, to manage their funds of money, &s;o that the intere&s;t thereof might &s;upport their mini&s;ters. The Congre|gational name was not in the original grant of tho&s;e lands, though the produce of them is now claimed under that name. And &s;ince the foregoing account was written, a <HI>Narrative</HI> has been publi&s;hed, "By James Ellis, A. M. attorney at law." He is a &s;on of the mini&s;ter before named; and his narrative con|firms what I had before written, if it is carefully ex|amined. He &s;ays, "The inhabitants of the precinct, at a lawful meeting, called for that purpo&s;e, unani|mou&s;ly concurred with the church in the choice of Mr. Ellis." This was on November 10, 1784, p. 11. But he did not accept of that call, and wanted more money. Therefore at another meeting, De|cember 27, 1784, they offered him an hundred pounds a year, and then he accepted their call; though this &s;um was voted by but little more than twenty men, and near three hundred men were tax|ed to pay it. Our author &s;ays, "Every per&s;on with|in
<PB N="156" REF="030011_0155_0FE3BF7DD1BF1F10">the precinct was taxed, and the collector ordered to gather the monies, without favour or partiality, or the lea&s;t di&s;crimination." P. 63. Yet &s;ome of them belonged to Mr. Snow's church, &s;ome to Mr. Peck's , and many to Bapti&s;t churches; and a large majority never had any concern with Mr. Ellis as their mini&s;ter. Yet his &s;on &s;ays of the party who cho&s;e his father, "Though they begun a good work, yet being de&s;titute of the grace of per&s;everance, they failed in its final completion, and brought difficulties to them&s;elves and all concerned." P. 16. But can any man believe, that it was a good work, for the minority to e&s;&s;ay to force the majority to &s;upport a mini&s;ter whom they never cho&s;e; or that grace was ever given to enable any to per&s;evere in &s;uch a way? As the&s;e people found that they could not do it, and called back the bills from the collectors in the &s;pring of 1790, Mr. Ellis &s;ued the whole precinct for his &s;alary in the fall after, but the action was con|tinued to March. And as the leaders of the precinct were not willing always to lie under this yoke, they called a meeting, February 7, 1791, when it was voted, "That the precinct do not agree that the Rev. John Ellis &s;hall officiate as mini&s;ter in &s;aid pre|cinct at the expen&s;e of &s;aid precinct." And his &s;on &s;ays, "Thus they flattered them&s;elves they had di&s;|charged their mini&s;ter, and boa&s;ted much of their novel and &s;hort method of di&s;mi&s;&s;ion." P. 23. Though the whole community of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed their governor near four years before, and all America have &s;till the right to leave their highe&s;t rulers out of office at appointed times. But God &s;ays of my&s;tery Babylon, The woman which thou &s;awe&s;t, is the great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth. Rev. xvii. 5, 18. And how evident is it, that the mini&s;ters who are &s;upported by law in our country belong to that great city? For the mo&s;t of them were very active in procuring
<PB N="157" REF="030011_0156_0FE3BFD76E1B2D48">the revolt of America from the government of Great-Britain, while they have never allowed the people here the &s;ame liberty concerning their relig|ious teachers, as they have concerning their gover|nors and legi&s;lators. And how can our legi&s;lature give mini&s;ters a power that they never had them|&s;elves? Can men be any longer blinded about the&s;e affairs? If Mr. Ellis would have given up his claim upon that precinct for the future, his pa&s;t &s;alary would have been paid, and all the trouble of &s;hut|ting him out of their meeting-hou&s;e, and the expen&s;e of courts upon the&s;e matters, would have been pre|vented. But in October, 1794, their fund of money, as well as a &s;alary for &s;even years, was given to Ellis's party by our &s;upreme judicial court, with va&s;t co&s;ts of courts again&s;t his opponents. His &s;on &s;ays, "A very full and candid hearing (continuing for two days and a half) was given both by judges and jurors. All records, from the fir&s;t &s;ettling of the town of Rehoboth, were brought into view, the facts fully &s;tated, and the law candidly con&s;idered." P. 49. And he &s;ays, "Re&s;pecting the fund, it ap|pears by the records, that in the year of our Lord, 1640, the old colony of Plymouth granted to the peo|ple of Rehoboth certain lands for the purpo&s;e of &s;up|porting public teachers of the go&s;pel." P. 55. Very true; and for &s;eventeen years after, all the arts of mini&s;ters, and of other colonies, could not bring Plym|outh legi&s;lature to interfere with the law of Chri&s;t, who &s;ays, They which preach the go&s;pel, &s;hould live of the go&s;pel. 1 Cor. ix. 14. But in 1658, gov|ernor Bradford, and other fathers of the colony be|ing dead, their children yielded to the other colo|nies, in introducing the u&s;e of the &s;word to &s;upport religious mini&s;ters. And four Quakers were hanged directly after at Bo&s;ton, who&s;e <HI>blood</HI> hath brought a la&s;ting reproach upon New-England. Though it hath been ignorance or wickedne&s;s, in all men who
<PB N="158" REF="030011_0157_0FE3BE8CE97528C0">have not exempted Plymouth colony from that re|proach. And how could lands which were given to &s;upport preachers of the go&s;pel, be taken away to &s;upport men who will not tru&s;t the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his influence for their temporal living? For though Abraham was an eminent &s;ervant of God, yet his children were a generation of vipers when Chri&s;t came in the fle&s;h. Mat. iii. 7. And God &s;ays of &s;uch, They hatch cockatrice eggs, and weave the &s;pider's web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is cru&s;hed breaketh out into a viper. I&s;aiah lix. 5. And how is this word now verified in this and other countries? For ju&s;tice can often be had in civil cau&s;es, while it is denied in re|ligious affairs. In the year 1760, they &s;old 674 acres of mini&s;terial land in Rehoboth for more than four thou&s;and dollars; but half of that money, which belonged to the fir&s;t pari&s;h, with &s;even hundred pounds more for Ellis's &s;alary, with great co&s;ts of court, have been taken from the majority of the in|habitants, and given to a &s;mall party therein. And becau&s;e two men placed them&s;elves upon the &s;tarrs of the pulpit, to prevent Mr. Ellis from crouding into it, on the day when the fir&s;t Bapti&s;t mini&s;ter preached therein, his &s;on &s;ays, "They were adjudged guilty of a breach of the peace, and &s;entenced to pay co&s;ts of pro&s;ecution, amounting to ninety-five pounds, fifteen &s;hillings and eleven pence; a high price for a &s;eat upon the &s;tairs in a decayed meet|ing-hou&s;e." P. 32. Yes; and if a Bapti&s;t ju&s;tice of the peace had not bound Mr. Ellis to his good be|haviour until the next March, we have no rea&s;on to think that Bapti&s;t mini&s;ters could peaceably have preached in &s;aid hou&s;e all that time. And his &s;on now &s;ays of them, "This conduct has unwillingly obliged many, even of the charitable, to fear that they were not men of piety, or common hone&s;ty."
<PB N="159" REF="030011_0158_0FE3BFDAE96D6C48">P. 68. Which gives a plain view of what many call piety and charity in our days.</P>
<P N="7">VII. But the people who invited Bapti&s;t mini&s;|ters to preach there, &s;oon ob&s;erved that they preach|ed another kind of doctrine, as well as in another manner, than their former mini&s;ters did; and a vi&s;|ible change was wrought in many thereby, and the Bapti&s;ts who u&s;ed to go to other meetings, gathered to this. Al&s;o &s;ince Mr. Peck's death, his church is di&s;&s;olved, and many of his &s;ociety have come here. A number of &s;ouls were hopefully converted, and old believers were quickened, and they &s;ent for min|i&s;ters to baptize them at &s;undry times, until the&s;e, with &s;ome who were members of Bapti&s;t churches before, having called in advice, formed a Bapti&s;t church there, November 27, 1794. And Mr. John Peirce Jones, of Providence, having preached to them through the winter, was ordained their pa&s;tor, March 18, 1795. They have &s;ince built them&s;elves a convenient meeting-hou&s;e, in &s;ight of that which was taken from them, at the di&s;tance of more than a quarter of a mile. Their wor&s;hip therein is to be governed by the church, and harmony appears among them. And the majority of the inhabitants of the towns of Rehoboth, Taunton, and &s;ome other towns, are now exempted from the taxing power of the Congregational denomination. And it is hoped that this freedom will prevail through the country, &s;o that all men who are willing to obey the laws of Chri&s;t may no longer be oppre&s;&s;ed by any who do not love him above all the things of time.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. The Bapti&s;t church of Taunton was fir&s;t gathered in Norton. Mr. William Carpenter was ordained the pa&s;tor of a &s;eparate church there, Sep|tember 7, 1748. He was born in Rehoboth in 1710, and his labours in this church were &s;ucce&s;sful, until he and the majority of the church became Bapti&s;ts, and he was in&s;talled in that order, April 1, 1761.
<PB N="160" REF="030011_0159_0FE3BF80E96FF4B8">Some of the members of that church, e&s;pecially they who lived in Ea&s;ton, had run into the mo&s;t delu&s;ive notions that could be conceived of; even &s;o as to for&s;ake their lawful wives and hu&s;bands, and to take others; and they got &s;o far as to declare them|&s;elves to be perfect and immortal, or that the re&s;ur|rection was pa&s;t already, as &s;ome did in the apo&s;tolic age. 2 Tim. ii. 18.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Shadrach Ireland, hereafter mentioned, was connected with them.</NOTE> But elder Carpenter, and a majority of the church, rejected tho&s;e abominations, and he continued faithful unto his death, which happened Augu&s;t 23, 1768. The mo&s;t of his church then lived in the ea&s;t part of Norton, towards Taun|ton, where a Bapti&s;t meeting had been long kept. Mr. Jeremiah Ba&s;&s;et lived there who was a member of elder Round's church in Rehoboth, and obtained lib|erty from thence to hold wor&s;hip on the Lord's-days at his hou&s;e, as early as 1744; and he improved his gifts there, and their &s;ociety increa&s;ed, until they built a good meeting-hou&s;e, upon the great road from Taunton to Bo&s;ton, in 1767, and in April, 1769, the Bapti&s;t church of Norton united with the &s;ociety in Taunton, and have held their wor&s;hip in that hou&s;e ever &s;ince. Their &s;econd pa&s;tor was William Nel&s;on, A. M. who was born in Middleborough, July 18, 1741, baptized in June, 1761, educated in Rhode-I&s;land college, and ordained the pa&s;tor of this church, November 12, 1772. And a great harve&s;t of &s;ouls was granted among that people in 1780, which in|crea&s;ed their church to near eighty members. But as Mr. Nel&s;on was not of a &s;trong con&s;titution, a &s;udden cold, after preaching at a funeral, &s;eized his lungs in &s;uch a manner, that he was not able to preach for &s;ome years; and he removed down to the &s;ea in Dartmouth in 1786, where he hath recov|ered his &s;trength &s;o far as to be able to preach occa|&s;ionally. His brother Ebenezer Nel&s;on was ordain|ed a colleague with him, November 10, 1790.</P>

IX. A &s;eparate church was formed in Attle|borough, and Mr. Nathaniel Shepard was ordained their pa&s;tor, January 20, 1748; and he was well e&s;teemed until his death, April 4, 1752. Afterwards the Bapti&s;t principles gradually prevailed among them, until they con&s;tituted a Bapti&s;t church there in 1769, and Mr. Job Seamans was ordained their pa&s;tor, December 15, 1773. He was born in Swan&s;ea, May 13, 1748, and went to Nova-Scotia with elder Nathan Ma&s;on in 1763, and was con|verted and began to preach there. But upon a vi&s;it to his native place, he went and preached in Attle|borough, which was &s;o agreeable to this church, that they prevailed with him to remove and become their pa&s;tor; and a great ble&s;&s;ing was granted on his la|bours in the winter before the American war; and a greater in the glorious year 1780, which increa&s;ed his church to 81 members. Mr. Seamans was al&s;o very &s;ucce&s;sful in labouring in many other places. But his people grew very &s;lack about his &s;upport, and the in&s;urrection in 1786 produced unhappy ef|fects in his &s;ociety, &s;o that he a&s;ked a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from them, which the church granted in November, 1787, though with reluctance; and he removed the next &s;ummer and &s;ettled at New-London in New-Hamp&s;hire, where (in its place) we &s;hall have a good account of him. This church in At|tleborough &s;ought for other helps, and Mr. Abner Lewis removed there in 1789, and mini&s;tered to them until 1794, when he removed back to Freetown, and though they have had other preachers &s;ince, yet they have no &s;ettled pa&s;tor. Their meeting-hou&s;e is upon the great road to Providence, 32 miles from Bo&s;ton. Six miles &s;outh of them is the &s;econd Bapti&s;t church in Attleborough. A &s;eparate church was formed there, and Mr. Elihu Daggett was ordained their pa&s;tor, July 3, 1765. He was born in that town, Augu&s;t 6, 1710; and he was beloved by his people,
<PB N="162" REF="030011_0161_0FE3BE903394CDB0">until he was taken away by death, Augu&s;t 29, 1769.

Mr. David Seamans was rai&s;ed up in this church, and was ordained a colleague with Mr. Goff, January 4, 1781, who was a u&s;eful mini&s;ter at Freetown afterwards. Mr. I&s;aac Ca&s;e was al&s;o rai&s;ed up in this church, and laboured to good purpo&s;e in various parts of the land, until he we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t into the di&s;trict of Maine, where we &s;hall hear more of him hereafter.</P>
<P N="11">XI. Freetown, which is on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river, again&s;t Dighton and Swan&s;ea, was &s;o abu&s;ively treated by a Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ter above &s;eventy years ago, that a number of the people turned to the Quakers, and many others di&s;regarded any religious wor&s;hip for a long time after. But it plea&s;ed God to pour out his Spirit upon the ea&s;t part of the town
<PB N="163" REF="030011_0162_0FE3BFE56AC82218">in 1773, when many were hopefully converted, and joined to the &s;econd Bapti&s;t church in Middlebor|ough. The next year they obtained preaching among them&s;elves, and they built them a hou&s;e for wor&s;hip, and formed a church there, September 13, 1775, being regularly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the church they had joined to in Middleborough, and Mr. Abner Lewis was ordained their pa&s;tor, June 26, 1776. He was born in Middleborough, March 16, 1745, joined to the fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church there in 1765, began to preach in 1770, and had preached in Freetown two years before he was ordained; and &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing was granted among them afterwards as increa&s;ed their church to 128 members in 1780. But the public difficulties in the country, with the unhappy temper of &s;ome of the members of the church, cau&s;ed Mr. Lewis to a&s;k a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from them, which he obtained in Augu&s;t, 1784; and he hath travelled and laboured in various places &s;ince, and hath &s;up|plied the church in Harwich for more than a year pa&s;t. The behaviour of &s;ome in this church hath cau&s;ed a number to a&s;k and receive di&s;mi&s;&s;ions from it to other churches, while &s;ome have died, and others removed away, until they are become very &s;mall. The we&s;t part of Freetown enjoyed but little of the ble&s;&s;ings which were granted round them, until the glorious year 1780, when a happy revival took place there, and a Bapti&s;t church was formed in 1781, and Mr. David Seamans was in&s;talled their pa&s;tor, Augu&s;t 13, 1783. He was a good preacher, and an exemplary walker, until he was drowned, by falling out of a canoe in the night, June 7, 1786, as he was returning from vi&s;iting one of the fick of his flock. After this mournful providence, they obtained occa&s;ional &s;upplies, from time to time, until Mr. Philip Hathway was in&s;talled their pa&s;tor, June 13, 1792. He had been ordained in Middle|borough, September 30, 1790. They have built a

<P N="12">XII. New-Bedford was once the ea&s;t part of Dartmouth, and a Bapti&s;t church was formed there, October 7, 1774; and Mr. Zaccheus Tobey preache<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to them for many years, until he was ordained there in 1792. The fir&s;t mini&s;ter in Dartmouth was a Bapti&s;t, but the Quakers have been a great majority in the town for many years, until they cen&s;ured and excluded one of their chief mini&s;ters in 1778, for appearing openly in favour of the Americans, while at war with Great-Britain. This cau&s;ed a divi&s;ion in their &s;ociety, and gave their children liberty to go to hear the preaching of other mini&s;ters, which was denied them before, notwith&s;tanding their great name for liberty of con&s;cience. Bapti&s;t mini&s;ters from Rehoboth and Swan&s;ea frequently preached in Tiverton and Dartmouth, and &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing was granted upon their labours in 1780, that many went and joined to tho&s;e churches, until a Bapti&s;t church was formed in Dartmouth, June 2, 1781, and Mr. Daniel Hicks was in&s;talled their pa&s;tor, the 10th of October following. He is a &s;on of elder John Hicks, of Rehoboth, where he was born November 30, 1755, and was ordained there July 12, 1780. Another revival was granted in Dartmouth in 1784, which added thirty members to this church by the clo&s;e of the next year. In 1787 a great ble&s;&s;ing was given upon the north part of New-Bedford, and a meeting was &s;et up there, and many were baptized among them, who cho&s;e to join as a branch of Dart|mouth church. Mr. Tucker Tabor was rai&s;ed up to preach there, who, with a number of his brethren, af|terwards removed into the State of New-York, though others have continued this meeting ever &s;ince, A revival of religion in Dartmouth in 1788, cau&s;ed the addition of about forty members to the original church. A cold and trying time followed for &s;everal
<PB N="165" REF="030011_0164_0FE3BE95C97785E0">years, but a fre&s;h revival began in January, 1794, which &s;pread in Dartmouth, Freetown, New-Bed|ford and Roche&s;ter; and Mr. John Lawrance was ordained a colleague with elder Hicks, the 23d of October following. He was born in Freetown, Augu&s;t 30, 1761, and he preaches chiefly in the ea&s;t part of that town. A Bapti&s;t meeting-hou&s;e was built in the we&s;t part of Roche&s;ter in 1793, and &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing was now granted there, that about forty per&s;ons were baptized, who al&s;o joined as a branch of Dartmouth church; and their addition in this re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al in all their branches was an hundred and fifty members.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. The Bapti&s;t church in Raynham &s;prang from the great revival of religion which began in the&s;e parts in 1779, and it was formed in the year 1780, and increa&s;ed to above fifty members the next year. But &s;ome of them were drawn away with cor|rupt principles, and others removed into di&s;tant parts of the country, &s;o that their number is now &s;mall, though the&s;e few appear to be &s;tedfa&s;t in the faith.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. The fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church in the county of Bern&s;table is in Harwich. The mini&s;ters of that county generally oppo&s;ed the great work which was in our land, in and after 1741; but Mr. Eli&s;ha Paine, who was born in Ea&s;tham, went and preached there, and al&s;o at Harwich, in 1744, with great &s;uc|ce&s;s. A &s;eparation from the oppo&s;ing mini&s;ters was the con&s;equence; and Mr. Jo&s;hua Nicker&s;on was ordained the pa&s;tor of a &s;eparate church there, Feb|ruary 23, 1749. Some of them were fined for &s;eparating, and di&s;tre&s;s was made upon many for mini&s;terial taxes; but this &s;erved to increa&s;e their number, until another church was formed in the we&s;t part of the town, and Mr. Richard Cha&s;e was ordained their pa&s;tor, December 11, 1751. The&s;e churches held to free communion with all Chri&s;tians, whether they were &s;prinkled in infancy, or baptized
<PB N="166" REF="030011_0165_0FE3BF865B330B10">by immer&s;ion; but as Mr. Cha&s;e was thus baptized in 1753, believers' bapti&s;m prevailed among them &s;o much, that many gave up mixed communion, and a Bapti&s;t church was formed there, and Mr. Cha&s;e was in&s;talled their pa&s;tor, September 29, 1757. And their principles prevailed &s;o much, that Mr. Nicker&s;on left his people, and went and &s;et|tled at Tamworth, in New-Hamp&s;hire. Mr. Cha&s;e mini&s;tered to his church for twenty years, and then the lu&s;t of intemperance had prevailed &s;o upon him, that he was depo&s;ed from his office, by the ad|vice of a council, in January, 1777, and he remained out of fellow&s;hip until he died in January, 1794, above eighty years old. And though his fall into &s;in was very &s;hocking to many, yet the faithfulne&s;s of the Bapti&s;ts in depo&s;ing of him rai&s;ed the credit of their profe&s;&s;ion; and a fre&s;h revival of religion among them cau&s;ed their principles to prevail, &s;o that the &s;outh pari&s;h in Harwich received a Bapti&s;t mini&s;ter to preach in their meeting-hou&s;e, and a Bap|ti&s;t church was gathered there, and a mini&s;ter or|dained in 1781. But they were not in fellow&s;hip with the other church, and their mini&s;ter proved him&s;elf to be a deceitful man, and finally went away and left them and their church was di&s;&s;olved. And in November, 1792, a minor part of the inhabitants of that pari&s;h &s;ettled a Congregational mini&s;ter there, and about two years after they taxed all the Bapti&s;ts to him, and in January, 1795, they appeared fierce for collecting of it, though advice from a di&s;tance re&s;trained them therefrom. A happy revival of re|ligion was again granted among the Bapti&s;ts in Har|wich in the &s;pring of 1793, which might occa&s;ion this fre&s;h attempt of their adver&s;aries to hold them in bondage as Pharaoh did. And in December, 1795, they &s;et out in a cruel manner to collect &s;aid tax, and hauled a number to gaol, and &s;eized the e&s;tates of others without mercy.</P>

XV. A few people in Barn&s;table withdrew from their pari&s;h wor&s;hip, and &s;et up a meeting by them|&s;elves in 1748; but they were &s;ined therefor, and two women were &s;et in the &s;tocks for not paying it. Yet their cau&s;e prevailed, and a church was formed there, and Mr. Nathanael Ewer was ordained their pa&s;tor, May 10, 1750, and he continued with them for more than ten years, and then went and &s;ettled at Newmarket, in New-Hamp&s;hire; and the Bapti&s;t principles gained ground in Barn&s;table, until they formed a church there, June 20, 1771; and it in|crea&s;ed gradually for ten years, in which time the mo&s;t of them were exempted from taxes to Congre|gational mini&s;ters, as they had given in certificates to that party. But as a powerful work began among them in 1781, and a mini&s;ter was rai&s;ed up to preach among them, and he was ordained their pa&s;tor, December 4, 1788, the ruling party re&s;olved to try what they could do towards holding them in bondage, as we have before related. Mr. Enoch Eldridge, who is their pa&s;tor, was born in Harwich, and he hath preached a part of his time to the Bapti&s;t church in Harwich, ever &s;ince he began in the work of the mini&s;try, until 1794. A fre&s;h revival of religion was granted in tho&s;e two churches in the beginning of 1793, and Mr. Shubael Lovel, a young phy&s;ician, was converted in Barn&s;table in March, and he began to preach there in January, 1794, and he was ordained as an itinerant mini&s;ter, April 29, 1795. Bapti&s;t meetings have been held for &s;ome years in Sandwich, Wellfleet, and Province|ton, in that county, though Bapti&s;t churches have not yet been formed among them.</P>

(Our &s;econd volume, p. 377.) Major Peter Norton, the high-&s;heriff of the county, was a father in that church, and it increa&s;ed to about eighty members.

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">I. BEFORE the revival of religion which took place in 1764, there was no Bapti&s;t church in any part of our country northward of Bo&s;ton, except one that is &s;ince di&s;&s;olved. The mini&s;ters on both &s;ides of Merrimack river were combined together again&s;t the former reformation in our land; and though a few people in Haverhill were &s;ubjects of that work, and &s;et up a meeting in &s;eparation from tho&s;e mini&s;|ters, yet it did not continue long. But a mini&s;ter of the we&s;t pari&s;h in Haverhill offended his people &s;o much, as to cau&s;e controver&s;ies in councils, and in publications to the world, which were followed with a forcible &s;hutting of him out of their meeting-hou&s;e, and then a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from his office there. And the people &s;aw &s;o much partiality in other mini&s;ters towards him, that they would not be di|rected by them in calling another mini&s;ter; there|fore they had been de&s;titute for &s;ome years, before Mr. Hezekiah Smith came and preached there in 1764, and then gathered a church in the heart of the town in May, 1765, as is related in our &s;econd volume, p. 236, 240&mdash;242. Their church increa&s;|ed to an hundred and fifty members before the war; and when that broke out, Mr. Smith engaged very
<PB N="170" REF="030011_0169_0FE3BF8BB0B74870">heartily in the cau&s;e of his country, and was a chap|lain in our army through the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing part of the war, only he was at home with his people in the winters. A fre&s;h revival of religion began among them in 1778, which cau&s;ed the addition of 54 mem|bers in three years; &s;ince which many have been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed to other churches, and others have been added to this. Mr. Edmund Pil&s;bury, pa&s;tor of the church in Northwood, was a member of this church. A&s;a Me&s;&s;er, A. M. a member of this &s;ociety, was educated in the college at Providence, in which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> is an e&s;teemed tutor, as well as a preacher of the everla&s;ting go&s;pel.</P>
<P N="2">II. A branch of Haverhill church was at the we&s;t part of Rowley, where a meeting was held for &s;ever|al years, until a Bapti&s;t church was formed there in 1785, and Mr. William Ewing became their mini&s;ter. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> was born in Scotland in 1728, and after <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> came to America, and became a Bapti&s;t, he preached in various parts of the country, till he was ordained an itinerant mini&s;ter at Sturbridge, September <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">7 1768. Afterwards he laboured a while at South-Brimfield, and then at Halifax in Vermont, from whence he removed to Shute&s;bury, before he came to Rowley, where he had &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s; but in about four years, this church di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him from them, and he removed to We&s;ton, and now preaches but little any where. In 1789 this church called elder Ah|&s;hai Cro&s;man, from Chelmsford, and in three years their church increa&s;ed from 44 to 99 members. Yet in 1793 he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and removed into New-Hamp&s;hire, and this church is at pre&s;ent de&s;ti|tute of a pa&s;tor. A number of people from Dan|vers had joined to the church in Rowley; but they were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed and formed a Bapti&s;t church in Da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|vers, July 16, 1793, and Mr. Thomas Green remov|ed from Cambridge, and became their mini&s;ter, of whom more will be &s;aid when we come to Cam|bridge

A Bapti&s;t meeting has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld for many years at Alm&s;bury, in E&s;&s;ex coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y, and Mr. Mo&s;es Chace is their mini&s;ter; but they have con&s;idered them&s;elves as a branch of the Bapti&s;t church at Brentwood in New-Hamp&s;hire.</P>
<P N="3">III. The fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church in the county of Middle&s;ex was formed at Chelmsford, in October, 1771, and Mr. Eli&s;ha Rich was ordained their pa&s;tor, October 5, 1774. He had preached to them for a year and an half before, and he laboured among them until the beginning of 1778; but then &s;ome of the members appeared to be &s;o much again&s;t him, that he reque&s;ted and obtained a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, and removed into Vermont, and he is now pa&s;tor of a church there in the town of Pittsford. Mr. Samuel Fletch|er removed to Chelmsford directly after, and preach|ed there for &s;ome years, and then went and &s;ettled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Salem, in New-Hamp&s;hire, where he was pa&s;tor of a Bapti&s;t church until his death la&s;t March. Mr. Abi&s;ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Cro&s;man, of Northbridge, was called to Chelmsford, and was ordained the pa&s;tor of this church, September 24, 1783, and in four years it increa&s;ed from 87 to 113 members; yet he was di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed, and went to Rowley in 1789, as before re|lated. Mr. John Peckens, who was born in Middle|borough, and ordained in Vermont, removed to Chelmsford and became their mini&s;ter in 1792.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The Bapti&s;t church in Newton &s;prang part|ly from members who formerly joined to the &s;econd Bapti&s;t church in Bo&s;ton, and partly from the &s;epa|rate churches of Brooklyne and Newton. A &s;eparate church was formed in Brooklyne, and Mr. Jonathan Hide was ordained their pa&s;tor, January 17, 1751; and he mini&s;tered to them until a Bapti&s;t church was formed in Newton, and then he met with them in his old age. A &s;eparate church was al&s;o formed in Newton, and Mr. Nathan Ward was ordained their pa&s;tor, January 17, 1753. But different &s;entiments
<PB N="172" REF="030011_0171_0FE3BF904600A6D0">about the &s;upport of the mini&s;try, and about the improvement of gifts in the church, cau&s;ed them to call a council, in April, 1758, after which Mr. Ward was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and he has been a mini&s;ter in the town of Plymouth, in New-Hamp&s;hire, for thirty years pa&s;t. Some of the old brethren died, and others removed into di&s;tant parts of our country, and things were in a broken po&s;ture in Newton for many years. But a &s;hower of heavenly ble&s;&s;ings <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> granted there, and a Bapti&s;t church was formed by them, July 5, 1780, which increa&s;ed to &s;eventy mem|bers in fourteen months. And Mr. Caleb Blood, who was born in Charlton, Augu&s;t 18, 1754, and ordained at Marlow in October, 1777, was &s;ettled as their pa&s;tor in 1781; and his mini&s;try appear|ed to be very u&s;eful among them for near &s;even years. But then the times became &s;o difficult, that the &s;ociety thought they could not &s;upport him and his family; and he had an earne&s;t call to Shaft&s;|bury, in the State of Vermont, therefore he was di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed to Shaft&s;bury, where he is &s;till u&s;eful. But a fre&s;h revival was granted at Newton, and Mr. Jo&s;eph Grafton was called to preach there, and he was or|dained their pa&s;tor, June 18, 1788. He was born in Newport, June 9, 1757, and had preached a various places, for &s;everal years, before he came to Newton, where a fre&s;h revival was granted in 17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">. He hath publi&s;hed a piece upon bapti&s;m, and a fu|neral &s;ermon.</P>
<P N="5">V. There was a Bapti&s;t church in Cambridge in 1751, and they had a mini&s;ter who was educated at New-Haven college; but he was drawn away by a pari&s;h mini&s;ter in Cambridge, and left his church, and others of them fell in with Shadrach Ireland, &s;o that this church was di&s;&s;olved. Yet there were a few names in Cambridge who had not defiled their garments; and in the glorious year 1780 a number more were converted, and a new Bapti&s;t church was
<PB N="173" REF="030011_0172_0FE3BFF3214BC208">formed there in 1781, and Mr. Thomas Green was ordained their pa&s;tor, November 26, 1783. He is grand&s;on to the fir&s;t Bapti&s;t mini&s;ter of Leice&s;ter, and was born at Worce&s;ter, January 3, 1761; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> church increa&s;ed under his mini&s;try to 56 mem|bers. Their hou&s;e for wor&s;hip is near the borders of Lexington and Woburn, and members of this &s;ociety in each of the&s;e towns were forced to pay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">xes to Congregational mini&s;ters, until they had &s;hed the money out of the hands of their oppre&s;&s;ors, fir&s;t in Cambridge, then in Lexington, and la&s;tly in Woburn; and the Bapti&s;ts never recovered half &s;o much money in either of the&s;e towns, as had been unju&s;tly taken from them; and as &s;oon as the Con|gregational party found that they could not hold the money, they collected no more taxes for any mini&s;|ters from the Bapti&s;ts. And not long after their la&s;t ca&s;es in court were decided in favour of the Bap|ti&s;t, their mini&s;ter left them, in April, 1793, and removed to Danvers, as was before mentioned. Yet &s;uch a revival was granted among them &s;oon after, e&s;pecially in Woburn, as cau&s;ed the addition of 37 members to this church in two years, and a new meeting-hou&s;e was built in Woburn. Mr. John Peak laboured among them more than a year, and Mr. Lovel &s;ucceeded him la&s;t fall. And in 1795 the fir&s;t pari&s;h in Cambridge procured an act of our legi&s;lature, to empower them to &s;ell &s;ome mini&s;terial lands in the town, and to &s;ecure all the monies ob|tained thereby, for the &s;upport of Congregational mini&s;ters in that pari&s;h. A Bapti&s;t church was formed in We&s;ton, July 14, 1789, in which were 19 members the next year; but they have not in|crea&s;ed &s;ince. A Bapti&s;t meeting hath been upheld for many years in Framingham, where no church is yet formed.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The Bapti&s;t church at Leice&s;ter, in the coun|ty of Worce&s;ter, was con&s;tituted September 28, 1738,
<PB N="174" REF="030011_0173_0FE3BF95864CCB00">under the charge of elder Thomas Green, who was ordained a year before, a colleague with elder March, of Sutton; but they now became two churches by mutual con&s;ent. Elder Green went from Malden, and was an early planter at Leice&s;ter, and became a very u&s;eful phy&s;ician, and acquired &s;uch an e&s;tate, that he was the main &s;upport of his &s;ociety in tem|porals as well as &s;pirituals all his days. He travel|led much in the country as a phy&s;ician, and preach|ed frequently, and baptized many, until he was ca&s;t|ed away by death, Augu&s;t 20, 1773, aged 73. Ben|jamin Fo&s;ter, D. D. who was educated at Yale col|lege, was ordained his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, October 23, 1776, and the church increa&s;ed under his mini&s;try, from 30 to 76 members, in five years. But as he in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|ed to devote him&s;elf entirely to &s;tudy, and to the mini&s;try of the word, the people who had not him u&s;ed to &s;upport their mini&s;ter, neglected him to much, that he reque&s;ted a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from the church, which they at length granted, though re|luctantly, in 1782, and he went and preached Danvers, his native place, above two years. And in January, 1785, he was called to the fir&s;t church in Newport, where he laboured with &s;ucce&s;s for man than two years, and then went to New-York, and is now the pa&s;tor of the fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church in that city. Mr. I&s;aac Beals was the next pa&s;tor of the Bapti&s;t church in Leice&s;ter, where he was ordained, December 1, 1784, and they pro&s;pered under his mini&s;try for two years; but then an in&s;urrection took place in that part of the country, which great|ly effected that church and &s;ociety; and after many endeavours to &s;ettle matters among them, without &s;o good an effect as to unite them all again, he was di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed in 1789, and went and &s;ettled at Clarendon, in Vermont, where he is now a u&s;eful mini&s;ter. Mr. Nathan Dana, from Newton, was &s;oon after called to preach at Leice&s;ter; and he was ordained at
<PB N="175" REF="030011_0174_0FE3BE7377EE8AE0">Newton as an itinerant mini&s;ter, November 20, 1793, and now mini&s;ters to this people.</P>
<P N="7">VII. A &s;eparate church was formed at Stur|bridge, and Mr. John Blunt was ordained their pa&s;|tor, September 28, 1748; and they became nume|rous, before the Bapti&s;t principles were embraced among them in June, 1749, and before the end of that year above &s;ixty members, including all the of|ficers of the church, were baptized. Some account of their &s;ufferings was given in our &s;econd volume, p. 191&mdash;194. But &s;ome &s;eparate mini&s;ters in Con|necticut made &s;uch terrible repre&s;entations of its being a wicked thing for any to be re-baptized, that Mr. Blunt retracted his being dipped, and he left his people, and went into our army, where he was &s;lain near lake George, September 8, 1755. And though the main body of the church per&s;ever|ed in their profe&s;&s;ion, yet they pa&s;&s;ed through many trying &s;cenes, and did not obtain a &s;ettled mini&s;ter for many years. Mr. William Ewing preached there for &s;ome time, and was ordained there, Septem|ber 27, 1768, as an itinerant mini&s;ter; and he went from thence to South-Brimfield, and &s;ince to other places, as was before ob&s;erved. Mr. Jordan Dodge, from Canterbury, was called to preach at Sturbridge, and he was ordained their pa&s;tor, Octo|ber 27, 1784, and they pro&s;pered under his mini&s;try for &s;everal years; but in the clo&s;e of 1788, &s;uch dif|ficulties aro&s;e that he a&s;ked and obtained a di&s;mi&s;|&s;ion, and went and &s;ettled in the State of New-York, where he was found to be a deceitful man, and was rejected by the Bapti&s;t churches in tho&s;e parts. However, the &s;chool of afflictions which this church hath been in, with the &s;piritual teachings that have been granted to them, hath brought them to con&s;id|erable fruitfulne&s;s in Chri&s;tian knowledge and con|duct, in which it is hoped they will grow and in|crea&s;e unto the end. A fre&s;h revival was lately
<PB N="176" REF="030011_0175_0FE3BF9AA1717A48">granted among them under the preaching of brother Zenas L. Leonard, who is likely to become their pa&s;tor.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. The Bapti&s;t church in Charlton was fir&s;t formed in Spencer in 1762, and Mr. Nathanael Green was ordained their pa&s;tor October 12, 1763. Their meeting was afterwards held in the we&s;t part of Leice&s;ter, until it was removed into Charlton in 1773, where it continues. And though it was a low time with them for &s;everal years, yet a glorious work began among them in 1779, which cau&s;ed the addition of 109 members in three years. The won|ders of divine grace in this land at that time when the war raged on every hand, and had greatly cor|rupted the morals of the people, and public credit was fallen to the ground, was evidently a great cau&s;e of &s;aving America from de&s;truction. This work was then powerful in Virginia, as well as in other part of our land. Elder Green continued a faithful pa&s;|tor and an exemplary walker, until he fell a&s;leep in Je&s;us, March 21, 1791, in the &s;eventieth year of his age. And the church &s;oon after called Mr. David Rathbun to preach to them, and he was ordained their pa&s;tor, September 25, 1793. He was born in Stonington, May 29, 1763, and his father, uncle, and one of his brothers, are all now pa&s;tors of Bap|ti&s;t churches.</P>
<P N="9">IX. A Bapti&s;t church was con&s;tituted in Sutton, September 16, 1735, and Mr. Benjamin Mar&s;h was ordained their pa&s;tor, September 28, 1737, colleague with Mr. Green. Mr. Mar&s;h was e&s;teemed as a godly man, of an exemplary life, though not of large gifts, until his death, January 4, 1775, aged 90. But the church was then &s;mall, and it is &s;ince di&s;&s;olved. There had been a great revival of religion in the Congregational &s;ociety in Sutton, in the year 1741, and a &s;eparate church was formed among them, and Mr. Ezekiel Cole was ordained their pa&s;tor, January
<PB N="177" REF="030011_0176_0FE3BFFAF975D6C0">31, 1751. But they were broken and &s;cattered af|terwards, and a Bapti&s;t church was gathered there; April 27, 1765, and Mr. Jeremiah Bar&s;tow was in|&s;talled their pa&s;tor, May 26, 1768. But a differ|ence in &s;entiment about the doctrines of grace cau&s;|ed his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from them, by the advice of a coun|cil, October 1, 1772; and he removed to Thomp|&s;on, in Connecticut, and never took the charge of any other church, though he preached occa&s;ionally, until he died &s;uddenly, by a fall from his hor&s;e, June 4, 1795. Mr. Eli&s;ha Ran&s;om preached to this church for &s;ome years, and was ordained there as an itinerant, November 11, 1778; but he went the next year to Wood&s;tock, in Vermont. This church in Sutton remained without a pa&s;tor, until &s;uch a di|vision aro&s;e therein that they were left out of the Warren A&s;&s;ociation in 1786. But the majority of them obtained a comfortable &s;ettlement again, and Mr. Ebenezer Lam&s;on removed there from A&s;hford, and was their mini&s;ter from 1788, until April, 1794, when they di&s;covered that he had fallen into the opinion of univer&s;al &s;alvation, and rejected him. The other part of this church embraced the opinion of mixed communion, and at length joined to the Croton Conference; but both churches were favour|ed with a happy revival of religion in 1792, and are now in comfortable circum&s;tances. Two of the breth|ren of the fir&s;t church in Sutton, Samuel Waters and Samuel King, have been called to improve their gifts in preaching the go&s;pel, though they are not ordained. Mr. William Batcheller, a member of the church in Northbridge, who lives in the ea&s;t part of Sutton, hath preached in tho&s;e parts for &s;everal years, until a fre&s;h revival was granted there, a church was formed, and he was ordained their pa&s;tor, Octo|ber 10, 1792. The Bapti&s;t church in Northbridge was con&s;tituted, Augu&s;t 31, 1780, and Mr. John
<PB N="178" REF="030011_0177_0FE3BF9EDD5137F0">Cooper was ordained therein, October 11, 1794, when there was a happy time among them.</P>
<P N="10">X. A Bapti&s;t church was formed in Peter&s;ham, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> 1768, and Mr. Samuel Dennis preached to them for a number of years, before he was ordained their pa&s;tor in October, 1778. He was &s;o well e&s;teemed in the town, that he was cho&s;en a member of our legi&s;lature in the time of the war: but worldly af|fairs did not turn him a&s;ide from faithfulne&s;s in the church, until he re&s;ted from his labours in April 1783. His church per&s;evered in their profe&s;&s;ion, though their meeting is removed into the bounds of Hardwick, where it is &s;till continued.</P>
<P N="11">XI. Royal&s;tone lies upon the north borders of our State, adjoining to Richmond, in New-Hamp|&s;hire. Mr. Whitman Jacobs had been pa&s;tor of the Bapti&s;t church at Thomp&s;on, in Connecticut, more than twenty years, before a part of them removed and &s;ettled in Royal&s;tone, formed a church there and he was in&s;talled their pa&s;tor, December 13, 1770. Their number was 29 the next year; and they had a revival in 1774, and another in 1779, and their church increa&s;ed to 89. But &s;uch contro|ver&s;ies aro&s;e in their church about di&s;cipline, and about &s;ome political affairs, that their mini&s;ter was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed in 1786, and he is now at Guilford, in Ver|mont. In 1789 Mr. Mo&s;es Kenny was &s;ettled as the pa&s;tor of Royal&s;tone, and they had a large increa&s;e of members for &s;everal years after.</P>
<P N="12">XII. Harvard is a place where the goodne&s;s of God and the folly of man have been remarkably di&s;covered. A powerful work of grace was wrought in that town, in the time of the great revival of religion through this land; but amazing delu|&s;ions appeared there afterwards. For Shadrach Ireland, of Charle&s;town, near Bo&s;ton, after acting as a teacher for &s;ome years, profe&s;&s;ed to have experi|enced &s;uch a change, both in body and mind, that
<PB N="179" REF="030011_0178_0FE3BFFF8D15B758">he was become perfect and immortal, and a number more with him, in the &s;pring of 1753. And he &s;et him&s;elf up as the head of the church, and a&s;&s;umed God's prerogatives in &s;uch a bla&s;phemous manner, that he was in danger of being puni&s;hed by authori|ty; upon which he ab&s;conded, and his followers &s;aid he was gone out of this wicked country. But he was concealed in Harvard, where a large hou&s;e was built for him, in part of which another family lived, and &s;carcely any men knew that he was there but his followers, who re&s;orted to him for his ble&s;&s;|ing, from various and di&s;tant parts of the country, and brought him a plenty of provi&s;ions. Ireland forbid them to marry, or to lodge with each other, if they were married, and he had left a wife and children in Charle&s;town; yet he took an|other woman, and lodged with her in Harvard all his remaining days. And when he was &s;ud|denly &s;eized with death, he &s;aid, "I am going, but don't bury me; for the time is &s;hort: God is coming to take the church." Therefore he was put into a large <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or, filled up with lime, and laid in the cellar, where it continued from September, 1778, to July, 1779, when the body &s;cented &s;o much that it was carried out in the night and buried in a corn-field. This account I have from under the hand of one of his followers, who has &s;ince been delivered from that delu&s;ion. But in the &s;pring of 1780, another com|pany appeared above Albany, with a woman at their head, with great &s;igns and lying wonders, and &s;uch uncommon motions of their bodies, that they were called <HI>Shakers.</HI> They removed from place to place, until they fixed their head-quarters at the hou&s;e where Ireland died, in Augu&s;t, 1781; and they carried on at &s;o high a rate there, that a motion was made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n our legi&s;lature to have them puni&s;hed by authori|ty, which motion was negatived by the majority of a &s;ingle vote, as we were well informed. But the fear

And they prevailed with many of their &s;ociety to &s;ell their e&s;tates, in order to build a &s;hip to carry the church to the New-Jeru&s;alem, as they &s;aid. And a large ve&s;&s;el was built in Rehoboth; but it was &s;ent a voyage to the We&s;t-Indies, from whence a rich <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> go was brought, and the ve&s;&s;el and cargo were &s;old, and a few men cheated the re&s;t out of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> e&s;tates, and their community is di&s;&s;olved in that parts. Some of them remain in the county of Albany.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. But a more happy &s;cene now opens upon Harvard.

He was born at We&s;tford, November 13, 1752, and &s;tudied phy|&s;ic with Dr. Green, of Leice&s;ter, and then &s;ettled in Harvard. And having called elder Rich from Chel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|ford, I&s;aiah Parker, Stephen Gates, Tarbel Willard, William Willard, Jo&s;eph Stone, Jo&s;iah Willard and eight women were baptized, and they were formed into a church, June 27, 1776, and Dr. Parker was or|dained their pa&s;tor, June 10, 1778. But two years af|ter they were remarkably oppre&s;&s;ed, in a time when it might have been lea&s;t expected. For the con&s;titu|tion of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts government was publi&s;hed March 2, 1780, when the compilers of it &s;aid to the people, "Your delegates did not conceive them|&s;elves to be ve&s;ted with power to &s;et up one denom|ination of Chri&s;tians above another; for religion mu&s;t at all times be a matter between God and indi|viduals." This they &s;aid becau&s;e Prote&s;tants were not &s;et above Papi&s;ts in our legi&s;lature; but in each town, one denomination has been &s;et up above all the re&s;t
<PB N="181" REF="030011_0180_0FE3BB0A557AF660">to this day, which they then acknowledged they had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o right to do. And one member of the Bapti&s;t church in Harvard was impri&s;oned at Worce&s;ter three months, another five, and one of their &s;ociety &s;ix months, between the publication of the con&s;titu|tion, and its taking place in October, for taxes to a Congregational mini&s;ter, who was &s;ettled in the name of the king of Great-Britain. The&s;e three men kept exact accounts of all their expen&s;es while in pri&s;on, with all that was given them there; and their accounts were examined the next year by two judicious men, who have given it from under their hands, that they expended an hundred and three dol|lars and a third, more than all that they received there. And no recompen&s;e hath ever been made therefor by their oppre&s;&s;ors. And can any man who believes that God governs the world, think it &s;trange that the powers of Britain have been &s;uffered to rob the Americans of their property, when robberies for religious mini&s;ters under Briti&s;h commi&s;&s;ions have been openly approved of in our country? May we not &s;ay with Jacob, O my &s;oul, come not thou into their &s;ecret; unto their a&s;&s;embly, mine honour, be not thou united! This church in Harvard was &s;oon after attack|ed by the &s;pirit of delu&s;ion, &s;o that they &s;aid in a letter to the Warren A&s;&s;ociation, September 8, 1783, "For twelve months we had but two per&s;ons added, and &s;everal left us, and joined the Shakers. We excom|municated eight per&s;ons in that time. A form of godline&s;s appeared on one hand, and a fal&s;e power on the other, and the church in &s;uch a low &s;tate, that we feared at times that our candle&s;tick would be removed out of its place. We &s;aw the enemy com|ing in like a flood, and that except the Spirit of the Lord &s;hould lift up a &s;tandard again&s;t him, we were a ruined people. Therefore we appointed a day of fa&s;ting and prayer, that God would pour out his Spirit among us, and work wonders under the name of
<PB N="182" REF="030011_0181_0FE3BFAAA3889E60">his holy child Je&s;us; and we have rea&s;on to think that the Lord gave us a &s;pirit of grace and &s;upplica|tion, and, for his own name &s;ake, was plea&s;ed to an|&s;wer us in mercy. The fa&s;t was on September 4, 1782, when there was a remarkable di&s;play of God's power and grace, in convincing &s;inners of their lo&s;t &s;tate, the hardne&s;s of their hearts and blindne&s;s of their minds, with their pride of life and rejecting the go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and then giving them to be|hold the Lamb of God that taketh away the &s;in of the world; the free &s;alvation of the go&s;pel, and cau&s;ing them to rejoice therein; &s;o that 49 per&s;ons were baptized among us from September 22 to No|vember 24, and 58 per&s;ons have been baptized among us &s;ince the work began; and we have often &s;at under Chri&s;t's &s;hadow with great delight, and his fruit was &s;weet to our ta&s;te. Our pre&s;ent number is 110." And they have enjoyed many ble&s;&s;ings &s;ince.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. The Bapti&s;t church in A&s;hburnham was con&s;tituted in February, 1779, and they have gone through &s;cenes of pro&s;perity and adver&s;ity; have en|dured oppre&s;&s;ion from others, and many trying things among them&s;elves. In 1787 &s;uch a revival was granted among them, as increa&s;ed their church in one year from 37 to 61 members. But they have never had an ordained pa&s;tor, nor any great altera|tions &s;ince. Several gifted brethren among them a&s;&s;i&s;t in carrying on their wor&s;hip, and they get help at times from other churches.</P>
<P N="15">XV. The Bapti&s;t church in Templeton was form|ed Augu&s;t 21, 1782, and Mr. John Sollon was or|dained their pa&s;tor, November 19, 1783. He was born in England in 1727, and lived a while at Bo&s;|ton after he came to America. He mini&s;tered to this church about two years, and then was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; and he hath preached &s;ince in various places, and is now living in Peter&s;ham. This church hath had
<PB N="183" REF="030011_0182_0FE3C009ED556478">many mini&s;ters to labour with them, and a happy revival of religion hath been granted there in two years pa&s;t, though they have not obtained another &s;ettled pa&s;tor. The Bapti&s;ts are &s;o much e&s;teemed in that town, that two members of their church have lately been repre&s;entatives in our legi&s;lature.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. A Bapti&s;t church was formed in Grafton in 1767, and they pro&s;pered for &s;ome years, and had 39 members in 1780. Above three years after, Mr. Elkanah Ingalls, of Rehoboth, went and lived there, and was their mini&s;ter for about four years; and then it was di&s;covered that he, with the majority of the church, had fallen into the opinion of univer&s;al &s;alvation, and they were left out of the Warren A&s;|&s;ociation in 1788, and he removed back to Reho|both, and is become a common drunkard. But a minor part of the church continued in their former faith, and &s;et up their meeting in Upton, and Mr. Simeon Snow was ordained in their community in June, 1791. They hold wor&s;hip &s;teadily there, though, their number being &s;mall, they have joined as a branch to Bellingham church. A Bapti&s;t church was once formed in Dougla&s;s, and Adam streeter was ordained their pa&s;tor, November 24, 1774; but he fell into the opinion of univer&s;al &s;al|vation, and was depo&s;ed from his office in 1781, and the church is &s;ince di&s;&s;olved, though a Bapti&s;t meet|ing is often held there &s;till. Streeter preached up his new opinions in various parts of the country for &s;everal years, and is &s;ince dead. A Bapti&s;t church was formed in Dudley in 1775, and elder Obed Warren was rai&s;ed up among them, who af|terwards removed into the State of New-York; but as many removed away, their church is &s;mall, if it is not di&s;&s;olved. Bapti&s;t meetings have been held in Brookfield, Shrew&s;bury, and Holden, where churches are not yet formed.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. THE fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church in the county of Hamp|&s;hire was formed in Brimfield, November 4, 1736, and Mr. Ebenezer Moulton was ordained their pa&s;|tor, November 4, 1741. His father and a majority of the church oppo&s;ed the work that was then going on in the land, while he and a minor part were alive in it; and they had much controver&s;y about it for &s;even years, and then about fifteen of them told their experiences to each others' &s;atisfaction, and &s;igned new articles and a covenant; and Mr. Moul|ton took them as his church, and would not allow any others to commune with them, without coming in at this door. The majority complained of this as unrea&s;onable, but acted nothing as a body again&s;t them. And many from other towns joined with them, in this new form, from time to time; and elder Moulton was often called to other places to preach and baptize in and after the year 1749. Yes, he was called above eighty miles that year, and bap|tized ten at Bridgwater, and three in Raynham. But as his people had been trained up with preju|dices again&s;t hireling mini&s;ters, they did very little for the &s;upport of their own mini&s;ter; therefore be took to merchandizing, when there were &s;carcely any merchants in that part of the country; and he &s;eemed to pro&s;per for a number of years, and
<PB N="185" REF="030011_0184_0FE3BE9EB9F17730">was a leader in building them a new meeting-hou&s;e. But towards the clo&s;e of the war, which ended in 1763, money was plenty, and merchants were multiplied; and Mr. Moulton found him&s;elf involved in debt, and his creditors ready to de|vour him, and he fled to Nova-Scotia, where he preached in &s;everal places. Hereupon the church looked out for another mini&s;ter, and at length ob|tained Mr. James Mellen, who was ordained their pa&s;tor, September 11, 1765. He was of Framing|ham, but had joined to the fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church in Middleborough; and he was a faithful and &s;ucce&s;s|ful pa&s;tor, until he fini&s;hed his cour&s;e in a joyful manner, Augu&s;t 5, 1769. After his death many of the old members, who had been excluded from the church for twenty years, came up and claimed a right therein; upon which they &s;ent to other elders and churches for advice, and when they had heard the ca&s;e, their advice was for each of them to endeavour to &s;atisfy the others about the reality of their religion, and &s;o to covenant together anew. And this advice was taken and followed with good effects. After this they called Mr. Elijah Codding, another member of the fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church in Middleborough, and he was ordained their pa&s;tor, November 11, 1773. And though it was a low time with them at South-Brim|field for &s;ome years, yet &s;uch a heavenly &s;hower was granted in 1779, as increa&s;ed their members from 23 to 236 in four years, and their mini&s;ter &s;till re|mains with them. And in tho&s;e times Mr. Moul|ton obtained letters of licen&s;e from his creditors to come home, and he was e&s;teemed among his old people, until he died there in 1783.</P>
<P N="2">II. A Bapti&s;t church was formed in We&s;t-Spring|field, and Edward Upham, A. M. was ordained their pa&s;tor, October 15, 1740. He was born at Malden, March 26, 1709, and educated in the col|lege at Cambridge, where he took his fir&s;t degree in
<PB N="186" REF="030011_0185_0FE3BFB41F144898">1734. After the death of Mr. John Callender, he was prevailed with to remove to Newport, in 1749, and he mini&s;tered to the fir&s;t church there, only vi&s;iting his old people once or twice a year, until he removed back to them in April, 1771. Though in the mean time &s;ome of the wealthie&s;t Bapti&s;ts had been drawn into the incorporation of a new pari&s;h there, and to &s;ettle a mini&s;ter, who was to &s;prinkle or dip people as they cho&s;e, and all were to com|mune together. And when Mr. Upham came back, and &s;et up wor&s;hip at his u&s;ual place, taxes to the government were laid upon him, and he could not obtain the liberty that all &s;ettled mini&s;ters have, without &s;ueing for it in two or three courts. And many broils, and great bitterne&s;s of &s;pirit hath been among them ever &s;ince. Mr. Upham has been &s;o infirm that he has not been able to preach for &s;ome years pa&s;t, and the people are in very broken cir|cum&s;tances.</P>
<P N="3">III. The town of A&s;hfield was planted in 1751, and a Bapti&s;t church was formed there, July 10, 1761, and Mr. Ebenezer Smith was ordained their pa&s;tor the 20th of Augu&s;t following. An account of their &s;ufferings was given in our &s;econd volume, p. 247&mdash;253. In 1770 they had 32 members, and they increa&s;ed from time to time, until the glorious ble&s;&s;ings of the year 1780 rai&s;ed their number to 94. But the uncommon difficulties about money after the war, cau&s;ed a contention between the min|i&s;ter and the majority of the church about his &s;up|port, which produced an open divi&s;ion in 1785. They called a council in December, 1786, who ju&s;|tified the mini&s;ter, and condemned the majority of the church, and in September, 1788, he prevailed with the Warren A&s;&s;ociation to leave them out of their number. But a powerful work began among them at that time, and they increa&s;ed to 113 mem|bers in le&s;s than two years, having ordained his
<PB N="187" REF="030011_0186_0FE3C00F703FD650">brother as their pa&s;tor. But as there have been &s;ome very unhappy actions in both parties, they have need of con&s;idering the warning which was given to the churches of Galatia, which is, If ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not con&s;umed one of another. Gal. v. 15.</P>
<P N="4">IV. A Bapti&s;t church was formed at Montague, July 1, 1765. An account of their &s;ufferings is in our &s;econd volume, p. 261&mdash;263. Mr. Simeon Coombs, from the third Bapti&s;t church in Middle|borough, removed there, and was ordained in that church, November 10, 1791. The majority of their &s;ociety then lived in Leverett, and they now bear that name. Mr. Coombs mini&s;tered to them about three years, and then was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and re|moved to Ward&s;borough in Vermont.</P>
<P N="5">V. The fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church in Wilbraham was con&s;tituted in 1768, and Mr. Seth Clark was or|dained their pa&s;tor, June 13, 1770. He was born in Northampton in April, 1723, and experienced a change of heart, in the glorious work there in 1735, under the mini&s;try of Pre&s;ident Edwards. This church had 39 members in 1773, after which our national controver&s;ies and a bloody war engag|ed the minds of men in general, until it plea&s;ed God to pour out his Spirit in &s;uch a manner in 1778 as increa&s;ed this church to 161 members in four years, be&s;ide tho&s;e who had died, been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed or ex|cluded. After peace was re&s;tored to our land, the minds of people were amazingly carried away with earthly vanities, and the love of many waxed cold about religion. Yet this church enjoyed many ble&s;&s;|ings, and they wrote to our A&s;&s;ociation in 1792, and &s;aid, "Through the goodne&s;s of God, we are vi&s;it|ed with the down-pouring of his Spirit in a mo&s;t marvellous manner, not only in almo&s;t all parts of this town, and in each denomination, but al&s;o in the and joining towns. Our pre&s;ent number is 235."
<PB N="188" REF="030011_0187_0FE3BFB908649EE0">They wrote again 1794, that they had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed 34, who were formed into a &s;econd Bapti&s;t church in Wilbraham, while 228 members remained in the fir&s;t church. The&s;e ble&s;&s;ings will appear the more wonderful, if we con&s;ider that the in&s;urrection in 1787 was in the&s;e parts.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The Bapti&s;t church in New-Salem was form|ed in January, and Mr. Samuel Bigelow was or|dained their pa&s;tor, May 21, 1772. He was born at Watertown in 1738, and new born in 1763. A gradual increa&s;e was granted to this church, until they had 38 members in 1785. But controver&s;ies about di&s;cipline in the church were followed with a bloody conte&s;t in the State, which made rending work among this people. The army who marched up again&s;t the in&s;urgents in the winter of 1787, took their cour&s;e through Wilbraham to Spring|field, where a few were &s;lain, from whence they went to Hadley, and then turned through New-Sa|lem to Peter&s;ham. Mr. Bigelow wrote to a friend on Augu&s;t 31, 1787, and &s;aid, "Church travel and ordinances have cea&s;ed here, ever &s;ince the people aro&s;e in arms again&s;t government; though at pre&s;|ent we are better united as to public wor&s;hip. There is in general a good agreement between me and the body of the people about wor&s;hip. I have &s;aid but little about the family quarrel that has been in this Commonwealth the year pa&s;t; but what I have &s;aid has been to condemn both &s;ides. I think the political fathers have provoked their children to wrath, and by oppre&s;&s;ion wi&s;e men have been mad, and the children have been unruly and rebellious." And it was a low time among them for three years. But he wrote to the &s;ame friend, February 12, 1790, and &s;aid, "This part of Zion has &s;carce ever been with|out a few drops of the rain of righteou&s;ne&s;s; but about &s;ix weeks ago, the Lord began to rain &s;uch a &s;hower as has not fallen in the&s;e parts before. It is chiefly
<PB N="189" REF="030011_0188_0FE3BEA446EECF90">on the youth, from ten to twenty years old. The people in general are bowed before it. A goodly number are hopefully gathered in, and &s;ome from almo&s;t every family. There is al&s;o &s;ome &s;haking among the dry bones in Shute&s;bury." Mr. Bigelow had been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his pa&s;toral rela|tion to this church before, by the advice of a coun|cil; and he preached in various places afterwards, until he gathered a church in Belcherton, and is at pre&s;ent their mini&s;ter. They obtained &s;everal min|i&s;ters to preach in New-Salem, until Mr. Jo&s;iah Or|cutt was ordained their pa&s;tor, October 30, 1794, and continues with them.</P>
<P N="7">VII. When the late war began, the Congrega|tional mini&s;ter of Shute&s;bury openly appeared to favour the Briti&s;h claims over America; therefore the people &s;hut him out of their meeting-hou&s;e, and he afterwards removed from the town. Yet after the war he &s;ued the town for his &s;alary, and our courts compelled the town to pay it, which cau&s;ed mini&s;terial tyranny to appear &s;o odious, that no min|i&s;ter of that order hath been received in the town &s;ince. Mr. William Ewing was called to preach there for &s;everal years, and in 1779 he was elected a delegate to the convention who formed the Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts con&s;titution of government, and he earne&s;t|ly oppo&s;ed the continuance of the Congregational e&s;tabli&s;hment therein, as other Bapti&s;t members al&s;o did, though the majority prevailed again&s;t them. A happy revival of religion was granted in Shute&s;|bury in 1780, when a Bapti&s;t church was formed there, and Ewing mini&s;tered to the town until 1785, when he went to Rowley. Mr. Jo&s;eph Smellage was called from South-Brimfield to preach at Shute&s;|bury directly after, and he was ordained the pa&s;tor of this church in October, 1786, and they have en|joyed many ble&s;&s;ings &s;ince, and he is continued with them to this time.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="190" REF="030011_0189_0FE3BFBE9BFF1D40">
VIII. The A&s;&s;ociation minutes give the number of members in the churches of Leyden, Che&s;terfield and Colerain; but a more full account of them, which I had an encouragement of, is not arrived. Mr. Adam Hamilton, who came from Britain, had lived &s;ome years in We&s;tfield, before a revival of religion was granted there, and a Bapti&s;t church was formed in 1784, and he was ordained their pa&s;|tor in November, 1785. He was much e&s;teemed as a preacher of the go&s;pel, and laboured much at home and abroad; and when the Danbury A&s;&s;ocia|tion was formed, he had a chief lead therein for two or three years. But he then removed to New-York, and was mini&s;ter to a church there in 1793; after which he came back to We&s;tfield, but fell into &s;ome &s;candals, which cau&s;ed him to cea&s;e from preaching. Another Bapti&s;t church was formed in part of We&s;t|field in 1785, which part is &s;ince incorporated by the name of Ru&s;&s;ell, and Mr. Ebenezer Stow is their pa&s;tor. The other churches in the county of Hamp|&s;hire, with the date of their con&s;titution and then pre&s;ent &s;tate are given in the foregoing li&s;t, from printed minutes, and the be&s;t information I could gain. I am favoured with a more particular ac|count of &s;ome of the following churches.</P>

<P N="9">IX. The lands near the head of Hou&s;ack river, which runs into the Hud&s;on at Still water, were pur|cha&s;ed by &s;ome men in Providence and Coventry in 1766, and a number of men removed there the next year. They fir&s;t called the place New-Provi|dence; but the place was afterward a part of the town of Adams, having Lane&s;borough on the &s;outh of it, until part of &s;everal towns were incorporated by the name of Che&s;hire in 1793. The fir&s;t inhabit|ants &s;oon &s;et up public wor&s;hip among them, and being joined by others from various parts of the
<PB N="191" REF="030011_0190_0FE3BE78B967A9D8">country, they formed a Bapti&s;t church there, Augu&s;t 29, 1769. Elder Peter Werden paid them a vi&s;it in the fall after; and as many of them had been his peo|ple before, he at their earne&s;t reque&s;t removed there in March, 1770. He was born June 6, 1728, and ordained at Warwick, May 21, 1751, and, after many labours in tho&s;e parts, now removed to this place, and hath been much of a leader among the churches who form the Shaft&s;bury A&s;&s;ociation. An uncommon death in the beginning of 1772, with a &s;ermon at the funeral, was the means of beginning a revival of religion among this people; and in the fall after, the work came on more powerfully, and pre|vailed through the winter. As the church gave a written account of this work, the mo&s;t material part of it is here in&s;erted. They &s;ay, </P>

<P>"The chil|dren of God began to be more manife&s;tly quickened, and more earne&s;tly engaged than they before had been. Love and unity daily increa&s;ed, and concern of mind began to be powerful on the minds of the unregenerate; and not long after &s;ome began to give hopeful evidences that they had pa&s;&s;ed from death unto life. The fir&s;t of our young converts that made a public declaration of what God had done for them, were received into the church and bap|tized on November 15, 1773. Soon after this, di&s;|tre&s;s of &s;oul, and awakenings on the con&s;ciences of &s;inners, became more general, &s;o that it was manife&s;t by their uncommon attention and &s;olemnity in pub|lic meetings, and their earne&s;t inquiries and lamenta|ble complaints in their private conver&s;ation, that the Spirit of God was operating on many of them; and in the cour&s;e of the en&s;uing winter and &s;pring, we had rea&s;on to hope that near forty were &s;avingly brought home to God, by a living union to Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Our number of members has increa&s;ed to about eighty. And although upon the mo&s;t clo&s;e inquiry, there appears to be a great variety of cir|cum&s;tances
<PB N="192" REF="030011_0191_0FE3BEA8DA81FAF0">in the &s;ubjects of the late work, yet in &s;everal things there appeared a general agreement. A clear conviction of &s;in, of the univer&s;al depravity of human nature, the rea&s;onable requirements of God's holy law, his ju&s;t declaration of vengeanes again&s;t &s;in, and the total &s;hutting up of all the &s;ources of their natural hope, which is ever &s;eeking &s;ome legal qualification to prepare for God's mercy; and then a di&s;covery of the all-&s;ufficient righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Son of God, as mediator between God and man, a &s;en&s;ible union to God, love to holine&s;s, hatred of &s;in, union to the children of God, and pity and be|nevolence to all mankind; in the&s;e and in other things of like nature, there appeared a very general agreement. The means of awakening people among us have been various, as, the preaching of the word, prayer, exhortation, religious conver&s;ation, occur|rences of divine providence, and the like; but the public relations of experiences, of tho&s;e who have been wrought upon, have been as frequent a means as any. The mo&s;t of the &s;ubjects of this work were in the vigour of youth, from fifteen to twenty-five years; though we have rea&s;on to think that &s;ome who were advanced in age, and &s;ome little children, have been made the happy partakers of the &s;alvation of God. This church does not receive any as mem|bers, but &s;uch as give &s;atisfying evidences that they are born of God, neither have they table-communion with any but tho&s;e who profe&s;s and practi&s;e believers bapti&s;m. They make no bar of communion, wheth|er per&s;ons come under hands or not. They hold to a general right in the brethren to improve their gifts, and yet believe that the church ought to exer|ci&s;e government therein, &s;o that the church may be edified by the gifts of the brotherhood. We believe the entire depravity of human nature, and that the ju&s;tification of a &s;inner before God is alone in the
<PB N="193" REF="030011_0192_0FE3C0140439F860">righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t. This was publickly read and acknowledged by the church as a true relation.</P>

<P>Another powerful work began among this peo|ple in 1779, which increa&s;ed the church to 133 members in 1782. A great ble&s;&s;ing was again granted in 1788, which cau&s;ed the addition of eigh|ty members to this church in a year. A like fa|vour was given again in 1791, &s;o that the next year they had 194 members. But many have been di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed to other churches, while &s;ome have died, and &s;ome have been excluded, &s;o that their pre&s;ent num|ber is not &s;o large.</P>
<P N="10">X. Elder Nathan Ma&s;on and his people, who went to Nova-Scotia in 1763, enjoyed many &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings there, and Mr. Job Seamans was con|verted, and began to preach among them; but not finding the lands in that country, nor the gov|ernment of it, to an&s;wer their expectations, they re|moved back, and &s;ettled in Lane&s;borough, a few miles from elder Werden, where a church was e&s;tabli&s;hed in 1771; and the work which came on in 1779 was powerful in both churches, and cau&s;ed &s;uch a friend&s;hip between them as gradually remov|ed the &s;eparation that had been handed down from their fathers, about laying on of hands upon every member. His church increa&s;ed to 150 members in 1784, and enjoyed many ble&s;&s;ings afterwards. But when elder Ma&s;on joined with elder Leland in 1791, a few of the church parted from him, and retain their old con&s;titution, as was before mentioned. Elder John Leland was born in the county of Wor|ce&s;ter, and was baptized and began to preach there in 1774. In the fall of 1776, he &s;et off with his
<PB N="194" REF="030011_0193_0FE3BFC34F5625C0">wife, whom he had newly married, and removed in|to Virginia, and &s;ettled in the county of Orange; and he travelled and preached abundantly in tho&s;e parts, and in fourteen years he baptized 607 per|&s;ons, and chiefly in the years 1780 and 1788, in which years religion was greatly revived in Virginia. He was very helpful in obtaining the law, in 1786, which aboli&s;hed all tax and compul&s;ion in Virginia for the &s;upport of any religious mini&s;ters. He pub|li&s;hed a pamphlet called the Virginia Chronicle, in which was the addre&s;s of the Bapti&s;ts to Pre&s;ident Wa&s;hington, and his an&s;wer, which we have referred to under 1789. He has al&s;o publi&s;hed &s;everal other things; and he returned with his family to New-England in 1791, and &s;ettled in Che&s;hire, in that part which once was Lane&s;borough, and elder Ma|&s;on is in the church with him, which is now large.</P>
<P N="11">XI. Mr Valentine Rathbun was born at Stoning|ton, in December, 1723, and after he, with many of his friends, removed to Pittsfield, they formed a Bapti&s;t church there in 1772, and he was ordained their pa&s;tor, and they became a large church in 1780. But many of them had now become corrupt in their opinions, and imagined that great and new things were at hand, with a more glorious di&s;|pen&s;ation than had before been known. And in April that year a man came into the place, and in|formed them, that a company of Chri&s;tians appear|ed above Albany, who had greater light and power than any had enjoyed before in latter ages; and many went up and joined to them, among whom were Mr. Rathbun of Pittsfield, and Mr. Samuel John&s;on, a Pre&s;byterian mini&s;ter in New-Lebanon, we&s;t of Pittsfield, in the State of New-York; and mo&s;t of the inhabitants of that town received them, as well as a large part of elder Rathbun's church. Though in about three months he left them, and publi&s;hed a di&s;cour&s;e again&s;t their abominations,
<PB N="195" REF="030011_0194_0FE3C01E88F215B8">dated December 5, 1780, which was &s;o well receiv|ed, that it pa&s;&s;ed five editions in a year, and was read much in all parts of the country. His brother Daniel Rathbun continued with them about four years, and then he came out from them, and pub|li&s;hed a more full account of their delu&s;ions than any before had done. But though tho&s;e Shakers are now reduced to a &s;mall number, and their power to deceive others &s;eems to be gone, yet many who had joined with them have turned off to other delu&s;ions, in&s;tead of coming into the way of truth. But a few names in Pittsfield are &s;tedfa&s;t in their profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="12">XII. The place now called Hancock was fir&s;t called Jericho, into which a number of Bapti&s;ts mov|ed in 1768, and following years, it being a wilder|ne&s;s before, upon New-York line; and they met for wor&s;hip with a number of brethren who lived over said line, until they cho&s;e to be a &s;ociety by them|&s;elves, where Steventon church now is. Therefore in June, 1772, fifteen per&s;ons in Hancock joined in covenant as a church of Chri&s;t, and elder Clarke Rogers became their mini&s;ter, though I have not obtained the date of his ordination. He went from We&s;t-Greenwich in the State of Rhode-I&s;land, from which State a large number of people went, who planted that northern wilderne&s;s. In the fall and winter after this church was formed, a powerful work came on among them. They &s;ay, "There &s;eemed to be a remarkable out-pouring of God's Spirit on the people, and the &s;aints were much en|gaged in his cau&s;e, while the word, like arrows, pier|ced the hearts of &s;inners, who were crying out un|der the guilt of &s;in; and when &s;ome obtained deliv|erance, they were expre&s;&s;ing the joy of their hearts, vi&s;iting their neighbours, warning them to flee from the wrath to come, and to lay hold on the hope of eternal life. Old and young were bowing to the &s;ceptre of king Je&s;us, and with one united voice &s;ay|ing,
<PB N="196" REF="030011_0195_0FE3C029673C4FC0">Ble&s;&s;ed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord, ho&s;anna in the highe&s;t. There were open conferences held once a fortnight, to hear the dec|larations of any who de&s;ired to join the church; and there was not a conference for many months, but that &s;ome were added to our number. Twenty were baptized in one day, and fifteen more in about a fortnight. Our number increa&s;ed in one year from fifteen to one hundred and eleven, and other churches were gathered round us, and &s;ome were given up to them for conveniency, and &s;ome few were di&s;ciplined and have gone off from us, &s;o that our pre&s;ent number is ninety-&s;ix." This account was &s;igned Augu&s;t 13, 1774, by Clark Rogers, elder, David Vaughn, Caleb Carr, William Doug|la&s;s, Je&s;&s;e Southwick, and Ichabod Southwick. But in the mo&s;t trying time of the war, when general Burgoyne &s;ent out part of his army towards Ben|nington in 1777, and captain Dougla&s;s collected his company together, ready to march again&s;t them next morning, &s;ome of his men went off to the ene|my in the night, and appeared with them in battle the next day, when &s;uch a victory was gained as greatly revived the hearts of the Americans, and Burgoyne and his army were captivated &s;oon after. This defection of &s;ome of the Bapti&s;ts in Hancock cau&s;ed a divi&s;ion in the church, and another was formed and continued many years; but they are lately united again, and one young man who then went to the enemy, hath not only manife&s;ted repent|ance, but al&s;o &s;uch mini&s;terial gifts, that he is or|dained the pa&s;tor of a large Bapti&s;t church near the place where Burgoyne was taken. How marvellous are the works of God!</P>
<P N="13">XIII. A Bapti&s;t church was formed in Wa&s;h|ington in November, 1777, and Mr. John Nichols is their pa&s;tor, who was ordained in 1784. Another church was con&s;tituted in Sandisfield in Augu&s;t,
<PB N="197" REF="030011_0196_0FE3BEAE82E9C9E0">1779, and elder Jo&s;hua Mor&s;e became their pa&s;tor. He was born in an uncultivated part of Rhode-I&s;land colony, where he never went to any religious meet|ing until he was &s;ixteen years old; but in hearing the clear preaching of the go&s;pel &s;oon after, he not only became acquainted with experimental religion, but an exhorter of others to regard it, until he com|menced a public preacher, and he was ordained the pa&s;tor of a church in New-London in Connecticut, May 17, 1750. It was in that part of the town which is now &s;et off by the name of Montville. The Stonington A&s;&s;ociation met there in 1773, the year after they were fir&s;t formed. Mr. Mor&s;e was much e&s;teemed, as a clear preacher of the go&s;pel, with un|common &s;olemnity, and with much &s;ucce&s;s. But in the time of the war, his people were much expo&s;ed to the enemy, and many of them removed away, un|til their mini&s;ter, by the advice of a council, remov|ed al&s;o and &s;ettled at Sandisfield, where his public mini&s;trations, and private conver&s;ation, were edify|ing and beneficial, and occa&s;ionally el&s;ewhere, until he died in a joyful manner, in June, 1795, in the &s;eventieth year of his age. The other Bapti&s;t church in that town I have not received a hi&s;tory of, nor of Great-Barrington and William&s;ton.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. Bullock&s;grant is a tract of land which was granted to &s;ome men from Rehoboth, which lies be|tween Che&s;hire and Hawley, but is not yet in|corporated as a town. A number of people from Middleborough, Taunton, and Berkley, have al&s;o removed there, and a number of them joined to the fir&s;t church in Che&s;hire. But a powerful work came on among them, and a Bapti&s;t church was formed, and Mr. Nathan Ha&s;kins was ordained their pa&s;tor, January 28, 1789. He went from Berkley in the county of Bri&s;tol, and many ble&s;&s;ings have been granted under his mini&s;try &s;ince. A Bap|ti&s;t church was formed in We&s;t-Stockbridge, Janua|ry
<PB N="198" REF="030011_0197_0FE3C018E242CC38">29, 1781, and Mr. Elnathan Wilcox was in&s;talled as their pa&s;tor; but they were afterwards broken and &s;cattered. Yet a Bapti&s;t church was gathered in Stockbridge and We&s;t-Stockbridge in 1790, and Samuel Whelpley, A. M. was ordained their pa&s;tor. He was graduated by the college at Providence in 1790, and &s;till continues with that people. I have not obtained a particular hi&s;tory of the other Bapti&s;t churches in that county.</P>
<P N="15">XV. But a particular account of the change which was wrought in one per&s;on, may give a more clear idea of the nature of the work that was going on in tho&s;e parts. A poor woman who was brought up in the wilderne&s;s, in &s;uch a manner as not to have learned to read, gave the following relation of her experiences, in the time of the revival at Hancock in the fall and winter of 1772, 1773. She &s;aid, "I lived in Little-Hou&s;ack, and I heard of a wonderful work of God in Jericho, how many were converted, which cau&s;ed me to reflect on my pa&s;t life, which terrified me much. One night I dreamed that the devil was come for me; I thought he came in a fla&s;h of fire, which &s;truck me down to hell, into great torment; then I lamented my condition, how I had neglected my &s;alvation, and now my day was over. Thus I awoke in great &s;urpri&s;e, and told my hu&s;band, who told me not to regard it, for dreams were nothing. But my guilty con&s;cience terrified me &s;o that I could have no re&s;t, day nor night: my &s;ins appeared very heinous, until I thought I could not live long under &s;uch horror. I went one day to meeting at Jericho, and thought I would never re|turn till I had found &s;ome relief, for I could not live &s;o; and I went and heard the number of fifteen tell the dealings of God with them; and they would tell my heart, only they had found deliverance, and I had not, which made me think there was no mercy for me: I was an undone creature, and my &s;ins ap|peared
<PB N="199" REF="030011_0198_0FE3C024106AA300">more heinous than before. There was a lecture in the evening, and I went to hear it, and the mini&s;ter preached very powerfully, and in&s;tead of yielding me any relief, it added to my torment. I I thought I had one more &s;ermon to account with God for, unle&s;s I obtained pardon through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which I thought was not for me, I had been &s;uch a great &s;inner. My load was &s;o heavy that I thought I could not bear up under it. I called my &s;i&s;ter out of meeting, and told her that I felt &s;o that it &s;eemed as though I could not live. She gave me but little an&s;wer, and meeting being over, I went to a hou&s;e to lodge, and the people were talking of re|ligion, but I was no company for them. I felt like a lone&s;ome monument of God's di&s;plea&s;ure. I got but a little &s;leep that night. Next morning I &s;et out to go home, and the&s;e words were u&s;hered into my mind, Turn, O &s;inner, why will you die? But I thought I had done all that I could, and there was no mercy for me; then the&s;e thoughts came into my mind, You have not given up your heart to God; and I found my whole heart to be a &s;ink of &s;in, and that I had been at enmity again&s;t a ju&s;t and holy God all my life long, and that God was angry with the wicked every day; and I &s;aw my&s;elf to be &s;uch a creature that I wondered that he would &s;uffer me to walk on his foot&s;tool. I wondered that the earth did not open and &s;wallow me up; as I pa&s;&s;ed along I was afraid that every tree would fall on me and da&s;h me to pieces, and I would run to get clear of one, and the fear of another would take me. Still the&s;e words would follow me, Turn, O &s;inner, why will you die? At length I was brought to view the ju&s;tice of God, and that I was a rebel ju&s;tly con|demned, and had been provoking God to anger all my life long, and was now about to receive the ju&s;t reward of my deeds, and could only plead guilty be|fore God, on which con&s;ideration I was brought to
<PB N="200" REF="030011_0199_0FE3C1FB0452E348">yield my&s;elf into his hands, with this repeated cry Mercy, Lord, mercy if po&s;&s;ible; though I could &s;ee no way that God could be ju&s;t and &s;hew mercy to &s;uch a wretch as I was. While I was, as it were, &s;inking with the&s;e melancholy thoughts, tho&s;e words were u&s;hered into my mind in a remarkable manner, Ye believe in God, believe al&s;o in me. The&s;e words gave me &s;ome glimp&s;e of hope. The heft of my burden &s;eemed to be taken away, and I felt calm and peaceable, but could not tell what it might be. I thought that if I was converted I &s;hould &s;ee Chri&s;t, and I would go out in the evening, and look on the firmament, expecting to &s;ee Chri&s;t; but then the&s;e words were u&s;hered into my mind, Peace to all the children of God, and peace to thy &s;oul. Then I went in and got the Bible, for my hu&s;band to try to learn me to read, and I could &s;pell a little: and as I then to read I thought the Lord a&s;&s;i&s;ted me in reading; and I &s;aid, Hu&s;band, it &s;eems to me that the Lord a&s;&s;i&s;ts me in reading, I never could read &s;o before. I had no &s;ooner &s;poken than my &s;oul was filled with divine love, yea, more than full. I thought there was enough for all the world to &s;wim away unto the bli&s;sful &s;hores of eternal day. My tongue broke out in raptures of prai&s;e, crying, Glory, glory to God in the highe&s;t! for he hath redeemed my &s;oul from the horrible pit! I thought I wanted to tell all the world of the fulne&s;s there was in Chri&s;t."</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">I. THE kings of England claimed a power of giv|ing the lands of the Heathen in America to their &s;ub|jects; and in 1639 a grant was made to Sir Ferdi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">do Gorges, of all the lands between Pi&s;cataqua and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ahock, and an hundred and twenty miles into the country, under the name of The Province of Maine. In this grant, and all others of the like nature, are imitations of the Pope of Rome, who received his power from the old dragon. And the in&s;pired apo&s;|tle &s;ays, I beheld another bea&s;t coming up out of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">th, and he had two horns like a lamb, and he &s;pake like a dragon, and he exerci&s;eth all the power of the fir&s;t bea&s;t. Rev. xiii. 2, 11, 12. The &s;ame power had before granted the charter of the Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts, which extended three miles north of every part of Merrimack river, which they con&s;trued &s;o as to reach a line from the head of the river to Ca&s;co Bay. And though New-Hamp&s;hire was taken from them in 1680, yet they exerci&s;ed a power beyond it afterwards. In 1681 a number of men came from Kittery to Bo&s;ton, and joined to the Bapti&s;t church there, one of whom was William Screven, to whom they gave an approbation to preach the go&s;pel, Jan|uary 11, 1682. But he was per&s;ecuted for preach|ing in tho&s;e parts, by mini&s;ters and rulers. Yet older Hull and others were &s;ent from Bo&s;ton, by the
<PB N="202" REF="030011_0201_0FE3C05916CE97B0">reque&s;t of tho&s;e people, to organize a church among them. Our fir&s;t volume, p. 502&mdash;505. And a church was con&s;tituted in Kittery, September 25, 1682, con|&s;i&s;ting of William Screven, elder, Humphry Church|wood, deacon, Robert Williams, John Morgandy, Richard Cutts, Timothy Davis, Leonard Drown, William Adams, Humphry Azell, George Litten, and a number of &s;i&s;ters. Elder Screven and others were repeatedly carried to courts, where &s;entences were pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t them, of fines and impri&s;onment, until they removed from &s;uch per&s;ecutors; and Screven went to South-Carolina, and became the pa&s;tor of the Bapti&s;t church in Charle&s;ton, from whence he wrote to Mr. Ellis Callender, of Bo&s;ton, June 2, 1707. He wrote again to him, Augu&s;t 6, 1708, and &s;aid, "I rejoice that you are inclined to, and employed in the ble&s;&s;ed work of the Lord, for the &s;upport of his cau&s;e and the comfort of his faints, left of that poor langui&s;hing church with you." Colonel Thomas Screven, a leading man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Bapti&s;ts now in Charle&s;ton, &s;prang from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Leonard Drown removed to Bo&s;ton, and his &s;on was deacon in the Bapti&s;t church there for many years, and his po&s;terity remain in the&s;e parts ever &s;ince, one of whom is a fellow of our college at Providence. But we hear no more of any Bapti&s;t church in tho&s;e parts for above eighty years after.</P>
<P N="2">II. There was a revival of religion in Berwick about the time that there was through a great part of the country, and after Mr. Hezekiah Smith was &s;ettled at Haverhill, he was &s;ent for to Berwick, in 1767, and baptized a con&s;iderable number; and he went again the next year and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in forming a Bapti&s;t church there, June 28, 1768. Mr. Jo&s;hua Emery was their teacher, though he was not ordain|ed; and they gave in certificates of their &s;ociety ac|cording to law, and yet were taxed to pari&s;h mini&s;|ters, and &s;poiling of goods or impri&s;onment was
<PB N="203" REF="030011_0202_0FE3C0A69FC34578">fiercely pur&s;ued for &s;ome years, for the collection of tho&s;e taxes, until &s;ome trials in courts put a &s;top thereto. Our &s;econd volume, p. 263. A divi&s;ion took place in this church and &s;ociety a few years after, and Mr. Emery preached to one part, and Mr. Wil|liam Hooper was ordained pa&s;tor of the other, Augu&s;t 14, 1776, in which office he hath continued ever &s;ince. He was born at Berwick, February 28, 1747, but he re&s;ides at Madbury, where is a branch of this church, and he preaches part of his time at each place. Sanford is above Berwick, where a Bapti&s;t church was formed, and Mr. Pelatiah Ting|ley, who went from Attleborough, was ordained there, October 22, 1772. But he afterwards re|moved to Waterborough, where he is pa&s;tor of a church that is not in full fellow&s;hip with mo&s;t of our Bapti&s;t churches; though another church was form|ed in that town in their fellow&s;hip, and Mr. Henry Smith was ordained their pa&s;tor in 1794. A Bap|ti&s;t church was formed at Wells, in 1780, and Mr. Nathaniel Lord, of Berwick, was ordained their pa&s;|tor. Dr. Mo&s;es Hemmenway lives in that town, who&s;e writings have been before mentioned. A Bapti&s;t church was formed in Coxhall, October 29, 1782, and Mr. Simon Lock was ordained their pa&s;tor, December 18, 1783. Mr. Tozer Lord, an older brother to Nathaniel, was ordained in a church at Lebanon, above Berwick, in 1776; but that church is di&s;&s;olved, and he now is mini&s;ter of a church in Shapleigh. Another church was formed in that town in 1785, and Mr. Nehemiah Davis is their pa&s;|tor. Mr. Zebadiah Richard&s;on was mini&s;ter of the church at Sanford in 1788, who is now pa&s;tor of a church in Fryburgh, on the we&s;t borders of the county of York. There was a powerful work in Franci&s;|burgh in 1788, from whence above twenty per&s;ons joined to Sanford church. A Bapti&s;t church was formed in Corni&s;h in 1792</P>

III. The fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church in the county of Cumberland was formed at Goreham, by a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Haverhill, June 20, 1768. Mr. Smith, of Ha|verhill, had been &s;ent for, and baptized &s;ome per&s;ons there the fall before. An account of their &s;uffer|ings is in our &s;econd volume, p. 279. It is &s;aid that a majority of them have &s;ince embraced the opinion of general redemption, and yet hold to the final per&s;e|verance of the &s;aints; and they are not in fellow&s;hip with mo&s;t of our churches. A Bapti&s;t church was form|ed in New-Glouce&s;ter in May, 1782, and they tried various ways to get clear of oppre&s;&s;ion from the Congregational party, and to &s;upport their own wor|&s;hip, until they applied to our legi&s;lature, and ob|tained an incorporation of a Bapti&s;t &s;ociety, inve&s;ted with all the powers and privileges of other pari&s;hes. But in about four years many of them found this to be &s;uch a bondage, that they renounced the &s;cheme, and formed a new Bapti&s;t church in October, 1794, and they joined to the Bowdoinham A&s;&s;ociation in Au|gu&s;t, 1795. A number of people in Harp&s;well had experienced a happy change in former times, and a fre&s;h revival began among them in 1783, which led on to the forming of a Bapti&s;t church there, January 20, 1785. Mr. James Potter had laboured with &s;uc|ce&s;s among them, and on October 6, 1785, he was or|dained there as a travelling mini&s;ter; and Mr. Samuel Woodward who was rai&s;ed up among them, was or|dained their pa&s;tor in October, 1792. In the mean time &s;uch a rain of righteou&s;ne&s;s was granted in tho&s;e parts, as cau&s;ed the wilderne&s;s to become a fruitful field; and three churches were formed in one year. Tho&s;e of Hebron and Buckfield were formed in Au|gu&s;t, and that of Paris in November, 1791; and Mr. James Hooper, brother to William, was ordained at Paris, June 25, 1795. Mr. Samuel Flagg, who went from Bo&s;ton, is preaching at Hebron. Mr. Abra|ham Cummings, who was educated in the college at Providence, where he took his fir&s;t degree in 1776,
<PB N="205" REF="030011_0204_0FE3C03FF64B23B0">preached for &s;ome years in the Congregational way, until he was convinced that believers' bapti&s;m was the way that Chri&s;t in&s;tituted, and was baptized in March, 1783; and in the &s;pring of 1787 he remov|ed into the county of Cumberland, and preached &s;o much in the pari&s;h of Freeport, that they gave him a good farm, but he could not be ordained as a pari&s;h mini&s;ter becau&s;e he could not &s;prinkle infants. He hath travelled and preached in many of our new plantations, but a number of per&s;ons were baptized in North-Yarmouth in the fall of 1795, who pur|po&s;e to form a church there, and to call him to be their mini&s;ter. He lately publi&s;hed a di&s;cour&s;e upon bapti&s;m. The late revival was powerful in Liver|more, and a Bapti&s;t church was formed there, Au|gu&s;t 7, 1793. Two brethren, Eli&s;ha Williams and Otis Robin&s;on, are preachers among them, though not ordained. The fir&s;t of them is a &s;on of Dr. Williams, of Ea&s;t-Hartford, and was educated at Yale college; but the &s;piritual teaching which he hath received in that wilderne&s;s, he prefers above all hu|man learning. The other went from Attleborough. A Bapti&s;t church was formed at Sudbury Canada, Augu&s;t 30, 1795.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The great collection of the waters of the riv|ers Kennebeck and Andro&s;coggin, with the rivers that fall into them, were called Sagadahock. A number of men came from England, and began a plantation there in 1607, thirteen years before our fathers be|gan at Plymouth, but they went back again the next year. But the colony of Plymouth obtained a grant from England of a tract of land of fifteen miles wide on each &s;ide of Kennebeck river, where they carried on a trade with the Indians from 1630 to 1661, when they &s;old the &s;ame to four men. Though in the mean time after the parliament of England had prevailed again&s;t the king who made tho&s;e grants of American lands, particular men obtained deeds of a
<PB N="206" REF="030011_0205_0FE3C062CDF7D228">great part of them from Indian Sachems, until an agent for the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts bought the whole of Gor|ges's grant of his heirs in 1676, and then tho&s;e lands were claimed by this government. And the charter of 1691 gave them all the lands from thence to Nova-Scotia, and this government have been often granting lands &s;ince to particular men unto this time. So that a great part of the &s;ame lands have been claimed by grants from the crown, by deeds from the Indians, and by grants from the legi&s;lature of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. Un&s;peakable troubles and co&s;ts of courts have been cau&s;ed by the&s;e oppo&s;ite claims, and when the&s;e con|trover&s;ies will all be &s;ettled no man can tell. A gentleman who was born in Berwick, but now lives in Bo&s;ton, and is attorney-general for this State, pub|li&s;hed a hi&s;tory of the di&s;trict of Maine in 1795, which gives much light into the&s;e affairs. Yet he appears to be not &s;o clear in religious matters. For he &s;ays, "There never was any thing like per&s;ecution in the di&s;trict of Maine, nor was there much paine taken, in the &s;ettlement of it, to e&s;tabli&s;h a regular &s;upport for the clergy: the want of this was a great injury to the people, for experience fully advocates the point, that without a regular fixed mode of e&s;tabli&s;hing teachers of piety, religion and morality, a country can never be made virtuous and happy." And yet he afterwards &s;ays, "In the pre&s;ent &s;tate of our gov|ernments in America, and in the enlightened age in which we live, religious opinions, however &s;trongly they may be expre&s;&s;ed, or however forcibly they may be urged, can do us no hurt."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sullivan's Hi&s;tory, p. 79, 232.</NOTE> But all ought to know, that reviling and lying as well as &s;poiling of goods and impri&s;onment, for matters of con&s;cience, are per&s;ecution in the &s;ight of God. Matt. v. 10, 11. Heb. x. 32&mdash;34. And have there been nothing like the&s;e in the di&s;trict of Maine? And if religious opinions can do no hurt in our governments, how can teach|ers
<PB N="207" REF="030011_0206_0FE3C0ABA1E0B2F0">of piety, religion and morality do any good therein? For the&s;e virtues are plainly de&s;cribed in the word of God, who &s;ays, If any have children or nephews, let them learn fir&s;t to &s;hew piety at home, and to requite their parents. 1 Tim. v. 4. Pure re|ligion and undefiled, before God and the Father, is this, To vi&s;it the fatherle&s;s and widows in their afflic|tion, and to keep him&s;elf un&s;potted from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ld. James i. 27. Therefore all things what&s;oever ye would that men &s;hould do to you, do ye even &s;o to them; for this is the law and the prophets. Matt. vii. 12. This is God's de&s;cription of piety, religion and morality; but all men who &s;upport religious wor&s;hip by force, violate the&s;e rules, more or le&s;s. The nation of I&s;rael was the only vi&s;ible church in the world which God empowered to u&s;e the &s;word in religious affairs; all adulterers, idolaters and bla&s;|phemers were to die without mercy. And when Chri&s;t by his death had aboli&s;hed all hereditary di&s;tinctions among mankind, and built his church of tho&s;e who were born again among all nations, the power of his go&s;pel da&s;hed the great Roman empire to pieces, with|out any help from the &s;word of the magi&s;trate. But my&s;tery Babylon was built, by confounding na|ture and grace, church and world together. And when the fathers of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts fled from her tyranny to America, they formed a government in imitation of the church of I&s;rael, and they made a law to put all adulterers to death, the year after they fir&s;t came to Bo&s;ton. And they had plain &s;cripture for it, if the church of Chri&s;t is in the &s;ame covenant that God made with Abraham; for by that cove|nant all adulterers were to be put to death, and all ba&s;tards were excluded from the church. Levit. xx. 10. Deut. xxiii. But the circumci&s;ion of the heart is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary, to give any per&s;on a right in the church of Chri&s;t. Therefore an in&s;pired apo&s;tle &s;ays, Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware
<PB N="208" REF="030011_0207_0FE3C067B47BE9C0">of the conci&s;ion. For we are the circumci&s;ion, who wor&s;hip God in the &s;pirit, and rejoice in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and have no confidence in the fle&s;h. Phil. iii. 3, 3. All men who tru&s;t in any arm of fle&s;h, are cur&s;ed with blindne&s;s, &s;o as not to &s;ee when good cometh; but they who tru&s;t in the Lord, and make him their hope, are like trees planted by a river, who&s;e leaf &s;hall be green, and they &s;hall not cea&s;e from yield|ing fruit. Jer. xvii. 5&mdash;8. And all mankind are in one or the other of the&s;e two cla&s;&s;es.</P>
<P N="5">V. There was but little appearance of relig|ion in the county of Lincoln, until God poured <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Spirit upon them within a few years pa&s;t. Mr. James Potter was born there in 1734, and was awakened to &s;ome &s;en&s;e of &s;in when he was about ten years old; and convictions followed him, from time to time, until a clear deliverance was granted him, October 3, 1781. And he &s;ays, "Now I began to &s;ee the ba&s;e views I formerly had of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and of the plan of &s;alvation; for when I had a di&s;covery of actual &s;ins, and of the danger I was expo&s;ed to thereby, I would repent and reform, and think what a glorious Saviour Chri&s;t was, and that &s;ome time or other he would &s;ave me from hell, and take me to glory, with a de&s;ire to be happy, but no de&s;ire to be holy. But, glory be to God! he now gave me another view of &s;alvation. Now I &s;aw his law to be holy and loved it, though I and all my conduct were condemned by it. Now I &s;aw that God's ju&s;tice did not &s;trike again&s;t me as his creature but as a &s;inner; and that Chri&s;t died not only to &s;ave from puni&s;hment, but from &s;in it&s;elf. I &s;aw that Chri&s;t's office was not only to make men happy, but al&s;o to make them holy, and the plan now looked beautiful to me, and I had no de&s;ire to have the lea&s;t tittle of it altered, but all my cry was to be conformed to this glorious plan." Our &s;econd volume, p. 394. It was then a very cold and &s;tupid &s;ea&s;on all round
<PB N="209" REF="030011_0208_0FE3C0AFD1B38268">him; but the views which were then given him of the glory of the go&s;pel, and of the worth of immortal &s;ouls, with the call of God to him to hold up the light which was given him to others, cau&s;ed him to leave the management of his farm to his family, and to go from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, in his own town and to neighbouring places, to hold forth light to all he could conver&s;e with, about the great concerns of the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">l and eternity. And in the &s;pring of 1782, he &s;ays, "The work began to break out wonderfully. Some were in great di&s;tre&s;s, and others prai&s;ing God, and inviting others to come away to Je&s;us Chri&s;t." And a number of them were brought to hold believ|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> bapti&s;m, before they had ever &s;een a Bapti&s;t mini&s;ter. Mr. Job Macomber was then preaching at New-Glouce&s;ter, and, hearing of the work in the county of Lincoln, he went there in December, 1782, and preached in &s;everal places with great &s;at|isfaction; and in January, 1783, he wrote a letter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Middleborough about it, which was read to Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Ca&s;e, which had &s;uch an effect upon his mind, that he was ordained for the purpo&s;e in September, 1783, and went directly into tho&s;e parts, and preach|ed with &s;ucce&s;s in Harp&s;well, and then with greater power at Thoma&s;ton, where he fir&s;t arrived in Feb|ruary, 1784. Mr. Macomber al&s;o removed to Bow|d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inham, in the fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of 1783, at the reque&s;t of the people. And in the &s;pring Mr. Lock was &s;ent for from Coxhall, and a Bapti&s;t church was formed in Bowdoinham, May 24, and another at Thoma&s;ton May 27, 1784. And Mr. Macomber was ordained the pa&s;tor of the fir&s;t of the&s;e churches, Augu&s;t 18, 1784, while Mr. Ca&s;e was &s;ettled as the pa&s;tor of the other, having been ordained before. Macomber was &s;on to a Congregational deacon in Middleborough, but joined to the fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church there in 1772, began to preach in 1774, and laboured in various parts of the country, until he &s;ettled where he now
<PB N="210" REF="030011_0209_0FE3BB18611F4368">is. Ca&s;e was born in Rehoboth, February 25, 1761, met with a change in December, 1779, began to preach in July, 1780, and was an early member of the Bapti&s;t church of Dighton, where he was or|dained September 10, 1783, and went directly into tho&s;e parts, where he is &s;till u&s;eful. As there was a great field for labour, and Mr. Eli&s;ha Snow, of Thoma&s;ton, was called into the work, their elders and brethren met at Harp&s;well, June 11, 1788, and ordained him as an itinerant mini&s;ter. On the 29th of the &s;ame month a Bapti&s;t church was formed in Va&s;&s;alborough, and another at Bowdoin in the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll after, where Mr. Potter lived, and he become their pa&s;tor. Mr. Humphrey Purinton is al&s;o a u&s;eful preacher in that church. And a Bapti&s;t church was formed at Ball&s;ton, January 3, 1789. The churches of Bowdoinham, Thoma&s;ton, and Harp&s;well, began their A&s;&s;ociation in 1787, which had become &s;ix churches in Augu&s;t, 1790, and 317 members.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The&s;e new churches in a wilderne&s;s had the powers of the world again&s;t them, and al&s;o many under the Bapti&s;t name, who gathered &s;ome church|es who held to doctrines which they could not have follow&s;hip with, while they had many difficulties among them&s;elves. Yet God was plea&s;ed to grant a fre&s;h revival among them. The &s;econd. Bapti&s;t church in Bowdoin was con&s;tituted, Augu&s;t 17, 1791, and Mr. William Stin&s;on was ordained their pa&s;tor July 5, 1792. Another church was formed in Sidney, June 20, 1791, and Mr. A&s;a Wilbur was ordained their pa&s;tor, November 13, 1793. Mr. Lemuel Jack&s;on, a member of that church, was or|dained as a travelling mini&s;ter the &s;ame day. The fir&s;t of them was born in Bridgewater, the other in Middleborough in the county of Plymouth. Mr. Potter was very &s;ucce&s;sful in Lewi&s;ton, from the be|ginning of his public labours, and many joined to his church from thence, until they obtained a regular
<PB N="211" REF="030011_0210_0FE3C0B524A22898">di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, and a church of 22 members was form|ed in Lewi&s;ton, March 3, 1792. And on Augu&s;t 3, 1793, thirteen of their members were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and formed a church in Greene. They al&s;o di&s;mi&s;&s;ed fourteen more, who formed the third church in Bowdoin, February 13, 1794, at which time they had 59 members left. And they &s;ay, "It appears that elder James Potter, and elder William Stin&s;on, were the in&s;truments that the Lord ble&s;&s;ed in the awakening the greate&s;t part of the&s;e, who appear to have been brought out of nature's darkne&s;s into the glorious liberty of the go&s;pel." A Bapti&s;t church was formed at Readfield May 11, 1792, and elder Ca&s;e removed and became their pa&s;tor, leaving the church in Thoma&s;ton under the care of elder Snow. And on July 27, 1792, a church was formed in Stirling, now called Fayette, and elder Eliphalet Smith became their pa&s;tor. He was converted at Stratham in 1764, and was ordained the pa&s;tor of a Congregational church in Deerfield in New-Hamp|&s;hire, in January 1770, though he and the majority of his church became Bapti&s;ts in June following. Our &s;econd vol. p. 267. But in &s;ome years after he removed into the county of Lincoln, and now became the pa&s;tor of this church. A Bapti&s;t church was formed on Mi&s;congus I&s;land, near Bri&s;tol, in 1792, and Mr. Andrew Fuller, who went from Mid|dleborough, was ordained therein, October 30, 1793. Another church was formed at Cu&s;hing in 1792, and Mr. Ephraim Hall was ordained their pa&s;tor October 24, 1793. A Bapti&s;t church was formed at Nobleborough July 25, 1793, another at New-Sandwich January 9, 1794, and a third at Barret&s;town in December following. As many of the Bapti&s;ts have removed from Martha's Vineyard to Sandy-River, a high branch of the Kennebeck, they have called their town New-Vineyard, and they formed a Bapti&s;t church there Augu&s;t 8, 1795.
<PB N="212" REF="030011_0211_0FE3C04580451B68">Another was formed at Clinton the 5th of Septem|ber after. Their elder, Mephibo&s;heth Cain, was or|dained at Clinton January 12, and Nehemiah Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld and Job Chadwick at Va&s;&s;alborough January 15, 1796.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Thus in le&s;s than twelve years twenty &s;ix Bapti&s;t churches have been formed in two counties, in which are fifteen ordained mini&s;ters, and about a thou&s;and members. And in Augu&s;t, 1795, their A&s;&s;ociation gave a declaration of their faith, wherein they &s;ay, "We believe that the &s;criptures of the Old and New Te&s;taments are the word of God; we be|lieve there is but one living and true God; we be|lieve the important doctrines of three equal per&s;ons in the Godhead, eternal and per&s;onal election, orig|inal &s;in, particular redemption, free ju&s;tification by the imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, efficacious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in regeneration, the final per&s;everance of re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> be|lievers, the re&s;urrection of the dead, the future judgment, the eternal happine&s;s of the righteous, and everla&s;ting mi&s;ery of the impenitent. We be|lieve that bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper are ordi|nances of Chri&s;t, to be continued until his &s;eco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> coming, and the former is requi&s;ite to the latter; that is to &s;ay, that tho&s;e are to be admitted into the communion of the church, and &s;o to partake of its ordinances, who upon profe&s;&s;ion of their faith have been baptized by immer&s;ion in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t," Now in all the&s;e articles they agree with the mo&s;t eminent fathers of New-England, except in &s;prinkling infants upon the faith of their parents, and calling it bapti&s;m, for which there is not a word in all the holy &s;crip|tures. But as a &s;on of Gideon by his concubine, &s;lew &s;eventy of his lawful children, &s;o one error of our fathers has prevailed again&s;t all their good principles and conduct. And all men who are now contending for the faith which was once delivered to
<PB N="213" REF="030011_0212_0FE3C04A8EC4CEB8">the &s;aints, are daily expo&s;ed to reviling and lying, &s;poiling of goods and impri&s;onment, from tho&s;e who &s;upport their wor&s;hip by force. We are well in|formed, that more than an hundred dollars have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> taken from people of the Bapti&s;t &s;entiments in T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p&s;ham for a Pedobapti&s;t mini&s;ter in the town, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ding civil and mini&s;terial taxes together; and the like is done in many other parts of the country. Thus men would hold their religion by the &s;ame ever by which they hold their worldly e&s;tates; though they daily deny their neighbours the lib|erty about their &s;ouls which all enjoy about their bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">s and e&s;tates. For no man is compelled to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a farthing to any phy&s;ician, unle&s;s he is plea&s;ed to employ him.

And when will men open their eyes, and renounce this iniquity!</P>
<P N="8">VIII. A revival of religion began on an i&s;land in Penob&s;cot-Bay, in the county of Hancock, now in|corporated by the name of I&s;le&s;borough, in the fall of 1790, and a Bapti&s;t church was formed there, May 27, 1791, and Mr. Thomas Eames was ordain|ed their pa&s;tor, June 19, 1794. He and a number of his people went from Mar&s;hfield in the county of Plymouth. There is al&s;o a Bapti&s;t church at Eppin
<PB N="214" REF="030011_0213_0FE3C02D02C70388">in this county, and Mr. Jo&s;hua Young is their pa&s;|tor, who was ordained at Ball&s;ton April 8, 1795. We have al&s;o heard of &s;ome Bapti&s;ts in Gould&s;|burgh, and Canaan, in this county, as well as of &s;ome in the county of Wa&s;hington, but have not any &s;uch accounts of them as may be of &s;ervice to the public. When the work of God was powerful in the county of Lincoln in 1784, one of the &s;ub|jects of it ob&s;erved, that the mini&s;ters who were &s;ettled and &s;upported by law were not made u&s;e of therein, even when they preached good doctrine, which cau&s;ed a &s;erious inquiry in his mind, why it &s;hould be &s;o? And having obtained a &s;atisfying an|&s;wer, he wrote the &s;ame to a friend, &s;aying, "The voice of the general conduct of true mini&s;ters to &s;in|ners is, We pray you in Chri&s;t's &s;tead, be ye recon|ciled to God that your &s;ouls may live: But the voice of others, to the church and the world is, We pray you in Chri&s;t's &s;tead, be ye reconciled together that we may live." And the help of all the power of the ruling party in our government hath not &s;ettled but thirteen of the&s;e la&s;t &s;ort of teachers, in all the counties of Lincoln, Hancock and Wa&s;hington, wherein are near &s;ixty incorporated towns, and many other plantations.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1 THE fir&s;t civil government upon earth, &s;ince the ri&s;e of antichri&s;t, which gave equal liberty of con&s;cience, was begun in Providence; and there was al&s;o the fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church in America. Mr. Roger Williams was born in Wales, in 1599, was educated at Oxford univer&s;ity, and was introduced into the mini&s;try in the church of England for &s;ome years, before he came over to America, and landed at Bo&s;ton in February, 1631. When he came there, he could not agree with the ruling party, in their u&s;e of the &s;word in religious affairs, nor in their re|ceiving the grant of American lands from the kings of England. This cau&s;ed his going to Plymouth, where he preached above two years, and then he was called and ordained at Salem; but the contro|ver&s;y aro&s;e &s;o high between him and the teachers and rulers of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, that they pa&s;&s;ed a &s;entence of bani&s;hment again&s;t him in October,
<PB N="216" REF="030011_0215_0FE3C06CDF17FDD0">1635, and in January, 1636, they attempted to &s;eize him and &s;end him back to England, but he fled to Rehoboth, and from thence to Providence, where he obtained a grant of lands from the Narragan&s;et In|dians.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Winthrop's Journal, p. 91, 92.</NOTE> And he &s;ays, "I was &s;orely to&s;&s;ed, for four|teen weeks, in a bitter winter &s;ea&s;on, not knowing what bread or bed did mean."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Collections of the Hi&s;torical Society at Bo&s;ton, Vol. I. p. 276.</NOTE> Yet he was &s;o far from &s;eeking any revenge upon tho&s;e who bani&s;hed him, that, at the hazard of his life, he went into Narragan&s;et, and prevented the Indians there from joining with the Pequots, who were for driving all the Engli&s;h out of the country, when Bo&s;ton was not &s;even years old. And any man who will read the books referred to in the margin, may &s;ee that Williams was a chief in&s;trument of &s;aving all the Engli&s;h then in New-England from ruin; though mini&s;terial influence was &s;o great in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts as to exclude him from liberty of coming into their government all his days. But the very year after Williams died in peace, the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts charter was taken away, and the king of England claimed all their lands, and his governor and council made laws, and impo&s;ed taxes upon them, without any hou&s;e of rep|re&s;entatives, and introduced the taxes upon com|merce, which finally brought on the late war. Mr. Williams, having obtained a deed of the lands in Providence, gave twelve men an equal right therein with him&s;elf, and he drew a covenant of &s;uch a gov|ernment in the town in civil affairs, as excluded them from governing in religious matters. And becau&s;e Jo&s;hua Verin refu&s;ed to allow liberty of con&s;cience to his wife, he was excluded from the privilege of voting in the town, until he granted that liberty. Upon this Verin removed to Barbadoes, and left his e&s;tate in Providence.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">In Winthrop's Journal he is called Urdin, p. 167. But it is Veria in Providence Records.</NOTE> As Williams and a number
<PB N="217" REF="030011_0216_0FE3C0C0A219DFA8">of his friends were convinced that profe&s;&s;ing believ|ers were the only go&s;pel &s;ubjects of bapti&s;m, they formed a Bapti&s;t church in Providence, in March, 1639, when one of them baptized him, and then he baptized the re&s;t.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Winthrop, p. 176</NOTE> But the unruly pa&s;&s;ions of &s;ome among them, with other things, cau&s;ed &s;uch &s;cruples in Williams's mind, in about four months, that he refrained from admini&s;tering or partaking of &s;pecial ordinances in any church ever after, as long as he lived, though he would preach the go&s;pel, and join in &s;ocial wor&s;hip with &s;uch as agreed with him, all his days. The rea&s;ons of this conduct may be &s;een in our fir&s;t volume, p. 143, 144. He went to England in 1643, and publi&s;hed an account of the Indians, of their language, and of his labours to in&s;truct them concerning Chri&s;tianity, which the Hi&s;torical Society at Bo&s;ton have lately re-printed. He procured a charter for his colony the next year, and went to England again to defend it in 1651, where he &s;tayed until 1654, when he returned, and was elected their chief ruler for near three years; and all his life after was &s;pent in &s;eeking the good of his country, till he died in the &s;pring of 1683.</P>
<P N="2">II. Mr. Thomas Olney, who had been a mem|ber of the Congregational church in Salem, but left them and came to Providence in 1638, was the next pa&s;tor of this Bapti&s;t church, and was al&s;o u&s;eful in civil offices, until his death in 1682. But a divi&s;ion aro&s;e in this church in 1652, about laying on of hands upon every member of the church after bap|ti&s;m. Ten years before, the Bapti&s;ts in England had adopted the opinion, that every man who had a gift given him to preach the go&s;pel, had al&s;o a right to baptize, even before he was ordained in any church; which opinion was held by &s;ome men of note in Providence for eighty years after. Mr. William Wickinden was a chief leader in that part
<PB N="218" REF="030011_0217_0FE3C0710DDB1A98">of the church in Providence who held to the laying on of hands upon each member, which they &s;uppo&s;ed to be intended in the &s;ixth chapter of the Hebrews; and he was an e&s;teemed mini&s;ter therein, until he died, February 23, 1669. Gregory Dexter was pre&s;ident of this colony in 1653, and he was very u&s;eful in government, and a father in this church, and lived to be 91 years old. Pardon Tillingha&s;t was "a leading man among the Bapti&s;ts in Providence," in 1672;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Williams's Di&s;pute with the Quakers, p. 208.</NOTE> and he was much e&s;teemed as a mini&s;ter among them, until his death in 1718. He gave the lot upon which their fir&s;t meeting-hou&s;e was built. Chad Brown was an early member of this church, and he is &s;aid to have been a teacher among them. And his &s;on John Brown was a mini&s;ter in this church, as well as a u&s;eful man in the State. And his &s;on James Brown was a pa&s;tor of this church for many years, and died October 28, 1732, aged 66. His &s;on James had four &s;ons, three of whom have been at great expen&s;e towards the college in Providence, and towards the Bapti&s;t meeting-hou&s;e there, as well as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he &s;upport of wor&s;hip in that &s;ociety. Jo&s;eph J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ncks came over from England, about the time that Charles the Second came to the throne, and &s;ettled in Providence, and was a u&s;eful man in his day; and his &s;on Jo&s;eph was a magi&s;trate, deputy gover|nor, and then chief governor of this colony; as well as a leading member in this church, and lived to be above ninety. His brother Ebenezer Jencks was ordained a pa&s;tor of this church in 1719, and con|tinued &s;o until his death, Augu&s;t 14, 1726, Aet. 57. His &s;on Daniel Jencks, and grand&s;on John Jencks, were both members of this church, and were em|ployed in &s;everal offices in the government, and al&s;o gave very liberally towards the college, and for the &s;upport of the Bapti&s;t cau&s;e in Providence. Deacon Samuel Win&s;or was ordained a pa&s;tor of this church
<PB N="219" REF="030011_0218_0FE3C0C59B7173A0">in 1733, and continued in that office until he died, November 17, 1758, aged 71. His &s;on Samuel Win&s;or was ordained his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and continued with this church until after pre&s;ident Manning came to Providence, and then, in 1771, he, with a number more of the church, went and formed another church in John&s;ton, where he yet is mini&s;ter. Mr. Thomas Burlingham was al&s;o ordained in this church in 1733; but he preached the latter part of his time in Cran&s;ton, where he died, January 7, 1770, aged 82. After elder Win&s;or and his brethren had formed their church in John&s;ton, this church in Providence &s;ent a committee to treat with them about their right in their old meeting-hou&s;e, and they agreed to take two hundred dollars, which was given them accordingly. This &s;ummary hath been col|lected from the be&s;t light that could be obtained, for no regular records have been found in this church before the year 1770.</P>
<P N="3">III. James Manning, D. D. was born at Eliza|beth-Town in New-Jer&s;ey, October 22, 1738; was early changed by grace, and joined to the Bapti&s;t church in the town where he was born. His educa|tion, and his &s;ervice in the college, have been de|&s;cribed before, but we &s;hall &s;peak more of him as a mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel. He was called to that work, and was ordained as an itinerant mini&s;ter, by the church where he was baptized; and he removed to Warren in the &s;ummer of 1764, and a Bapti&s;t church was formed there the 15th of October following, and he became their pa&s;tor. But when the college was removed to Providence, in the &s;pring of 1770, he went with it, and was frequently invited to preach in the Bapti&s;t church there, until elder Win&s;or, and a part of the church, drew off in the &s;ummer of 1771, and formed another church in John&s;ton, and then elder Manning was cho&s;en to preach and ad|mini&s;ter ordinances to this church in Providence;
<PB N="220" REF="030011_0219_0FE3C076C031F510">and he continued &s;o to do, until he re&s;igned that office in the &s;pring of 1786, although he mini&s;tered to them occa&s;ionally afterwards as long as he lived. And though his powers of mind and human accom|pli&s;hments were very great, yet he u&s;ed great plain|ne&s;s of &s;peech, and was as ea&s;ily under&s;tood by com|mon people, as almo&s;t any preacher in the land. And few men ever prized the &s;pecial influence of the Spirit of God in preaching, more than he did. He was at the Philadelphia A&s;&s;ociation in October, 1774, where he met with Mr. Daniel Fri&s;toe from Vir|ginia, whom he heard afterwards, with &s;uch clear|ne&s;s, life and power, though not a man of liberal education, as fired his &s;oul with fre&s;h zeal and cour|age in preaching &s;alvation to peri&s;hing &s;ouls; and Mr. Manning laboured with &s;uch faithfulne&s;s and &s;ucce&s;s, after his return to Providence, that he baptized an hundred and ten per&s;ons by September, 1775; and a large number more joined to Mr. Snow's church, even notwith&s;tanding the confu&s;ions of war which then broke out in our land. And when gov|ernor Cooke was cho&s;en member of the college cor|poration, and &s;ome &s;crupled whether he could prop|erly be denominated a Bapti&s;t, becau&s;e he was a member of a Congregational church, he informed them that he was ever a Bapti&s;t in principle, and was baptized by immer&s;ion, and &s;hould have joined to the Bapti&s;t church in Providence, if &s;uch doctrine had been preached therein then as there was now. Pre&s;ident Manning made it his con&s;tant practice, to charge his &s;cholars, when they left the college, not to imagine that they were qualified to preach the go&s;pel, until they were &s;atisfied that they were taught of God. At the commencement in September, 1789, he &s;aid, "Should the Chri&s;tian mini&s;try, with any of you become an object, reflect on the ab&s;urd|ity of intruding into it while &s;trangers to experi|mental religion. See that you your&s;elves have been
<PB N="221" REF="030011_0220_0FE3C0CA87FD4DA8">taught of God, before you attempt to teach godli|ne&s;s to others. To place in the profe&s;&s;ional chairs of our univer&s;ities the mo&s;t illiterate of mankind, would be an ab&s;urdity far le&s;s glaring, than to call an unconverted man to exerci&s;e the mini&s;terial func|tion. This is to expo&s;e our holy religion to the &s;coffs of infidels, and furni&s;h to their hands the mo&s;t deadly weapons. I omit to in&s;i&s;t on the account &s;uch mu&s;t render in the great tremendous day!" And his con&s;tant behaviour was agreeable to his teaching; and he united dignity and conde&s;cen&s;ion, authority and mildne&s;s, in &s;uch a manner as to be &s;cared and loved by the generality of his &s;cholars. He married a daughter of John Sires, an alderman of Elizabeth-Town, and a u&s;eful member of the Bap|ti&s;t church there; and &s;he met with a happy change, and joined to the Bapti&s;t church in Providence, in January, 1775, of which &s;he is &s;till an agreeable member, though &s;he has no children. Dr. Manning died in a &s;it of the apoplexy, July 29, 1791, when be, undoubtedly, entered into eternal re&s;t.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The opinion of laying on of hands upon every member in the church, had long made a &s;epa|ration among the Bapti&s;t churches in this land; but &s;oon after Dr. Manning came to Providence, he prevailed with this church to admit other Bapti&s;ts to occa&s;ional communion with them, though they would receive none as members until after his death. But on Augu&s;t 4, 1791, the church had a full meet|ing, and this point was di&s;tinctly con&s;idered, and a clear vote was gained to admit members who did not hold that doctrine. At the &s;ame meeting the church concluded to have another pa&s;tor ordained therein, namely, Jonathan Maxcy, A. M. He was born in Attleborough, September 2, 1768, educated in the college at Providence, where he took his fir&s;t degree in 1787, and was a tutor in the college, until he met with a change in October, 1789, and joined
<PB N="222" REF="030011_0221_0FE3C07CA2B54100">to this church, in which he began to preach in April, 1790, and was ordained their pa&s;tor, Septem|ber 8, 1791. Mr. John Pitman, who was born in Bo&s;ton, and had been a mini&s;ter &s;ome years at Free|hold in New-Jer&s;ey, removed to Providence, and he and his wife were now the fir&s;t members who were received into this church, without holding to the laying on of hands upon every member. He hath frequently preached the go&s;pel in various places ever &s;ince, without taking the pa&s;toral charge of any particular church. Thomas U&s;tick, A. M. took his fir&s;t degree in the college at Providence in 1771, was ordained in this church as an itinerant mini&s;ter, July 29, 1777, preached a while at A&s;hford, from whence he removed to Grafton in May, 1779, and then to Philadelphia in June, 1782, where he has been pa&s;tor of the Bapti&s;t church in that city ever &s;ince. A powerful work of grace came on in Prov|idence in the beginning of 1790, which cau&s;ed the addition of above fifty members to this church in about two years. September 6, 1792, Mr. Maxcy was cho&s;en pre&s;ident of the college, pro tempore, and he has been continued in that office ever &s;ince. He re&s;igned his pa&s;toral office in this church two days after he was fir&s;t elected pre&s;ident, and they immediately called Mr. Stephen Gano to be their mini&s;ter for &s;ix months, and he hath been &s;o ever &s;ince. He was ordained before in the State of New-York. Mr. John Gano, his father, was a mini&s;ter in the city of New-York before the late war, but he is now in Kentucky; and he hath been the mo&s;t exten|&s;ive traveller to preach the go&s;pel, of any man now living in America. Forty-&s;ix members have been added to this church in Providence, &s;ince Mr. Ste|phen Gano came there; and he drew the circular letter for the Warren A&s;&s;ociation in 1795.</P>
<P N="5">V. The corporation of the college at Providence con&s;i&s;ts of twelve fellows, and thirty-&s;ix tru&s;tees.
<PB N="223" REF="030011_0222_0FE3C0D102D094C0">The fellows, as a learned faculty, have the power of conferring the degrees, but in other affairs the college is governed by the concurrence of both branches. The pre&s;ident is always to be a Bapti&s;t, and &s;o are &s;even more of the fellows, while the other four may be cho&s;en out of any of the other denominations. Twenty-two of the tru&s;tees are al&s;o to be Bapti&s;ts, five of them are to be Epi&s;copalians, five Quakers, and four Congregationali&s;ts. The chancellor is cho|&s;en out of the tru&s;tees, and the &s;ecretary out of the fellows. No religious te&s;t is ever to be required of any of the corporation, nor of the &s;cholars who are gradu|ated therein; though great care is to be taken as to the morals of the college. Their fir&s;t funds were collected by Mr. Morgan Edwards, in England and Ireland, and by Mr. Hezekiah Smith, in South-Car|olina and Georgia; to which additions have been &s;ince made from various quarters, but all by per&s;onal genero&s;ity. The&s;e monies were chiefly lent to Rhode-I&s;land government, though &s;ome have been put into a national bank; but the intere&s;t thereof, with the income from the &s;tudents, who are near eighty, is &s;cantly &s;ufficient to &s;upport the officers of the col|lege.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In 1795, they had given degrees to 380 &s;cholars who were educated in this college.</NOTE> The building and repairing of the college edifice, the pre&s;ident's hou&s;e, with the purcha&s;e of the lands about them, and al&s;o the college library and apparatus, were all done by per&s;onal benefactions, and chiefly in the town of Providence. And &s;o was the Bapti&s;t meeting-hou&s;e, bell and clock, with the lot on which it &s;tands, all which co&s;t about &s;even thou&s;and pounds. They fir&s;t met in &s;aid hou&s;e, May 28, 1775. How fal&s;e then are the pretences of many, that religion and learning would fail from among us if they were not upheld by the power of the magi&s;trate! It is readily granted that there has been much religion and knowledge among tho&s;e
<PB N="224" REF="030011_0223_0FE3C081C2D29C48">who have gone on in that way; but the light and power of the go&s;pel is directly again&s;t all deceit or violence. And God &s;ays of his church, In this mountain &s;hall the Lord of ho&s;ts make unto all peo|ple a fea&s;t of fat things, a fea&s;t of wines on the lees; of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined. And he will de&s;troy in this mountain the face of the covering ca&s;t over all people, and the vail that is &s;pread over all nations, I&s;aiah xxv. 6, 7. A covering and appearance of religion hath been kept up by the power of the magi&s;trate, which the fea&s;t of the go&s;pel, in the church of Chri&s;t, will de&s;troy.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Ever &s;ince the reformation in Germany, many have ca&s;t the reproach of all the evils which have appeared among the Bapti&s;ts upon that denom|ination in general; which is as unju&s;t as it would be for others to charge all the evils that ever were it national churches, upon all men who hold to infant bapti&s;m. But abu&s;ive treatment on either &s;ide is exceeding apt to beget prejudices in the mind again&s;t good principles and conduct, which are held by their oppo&s;ites. And as Calvini&s;m was held by tho&s;e who bani&s;hed the fir&s;t planters of Providence, and of Rhode-I&s;land colony, and who greatly abu&s;ed tho&s;e people all their days, many of their children have imagined that the true liberty of moral agents could not be &s;ecured upon that plan of doctrine. Though it is abundantly evident, that Mr. Williams, who procured the fir&s;t charter, and Mr. Clarke, who pro|cured the &s;econd, for this colony of liberty, held to that plan of doctrine as firmly as any men in their day. And how can any man enjoy comfort and lib|erty in his &s;oul, in the mid&s;t of the confu&s;ions of the world, without believing that men nor devils can never deceive their faithful God, nor defeat any of his de&s;igns? That he never makes u&s;e of any po&s;i|tive influence to move men to &s;in, or to hinder their
<PB N="225" REF="030011_0224_0FE3C0D5944B34A8">coming to Chri&s;t, I as firmly believe as I believe he is ju&s;t and good; but the lu&s;ts of men are &s;o power|ful, and the wiles of the devil are &s;o many, that no man can overcome them of him&s;elf, though the Spirit of God makes every true believer a conqueror over them all. But as a &s;eparation among the Bapti&s;ts in the la&s;t century, was followed with a departure from the&s;e &s;entiments, and their churches have not been in fellow&s;hip with mo&s;t of the Bapti&s;t churches lately gathered in this land, I &s;hall &s;ay but little about them, more than to mention where they are, and who have been their mini&s;ters. Mr. Samuel Fi&s;k was ordained the pa&s;tor of a Bapti&s;t church in Scitu|ate, and continued with them to old age; but I have not obtained the date of his ordination, nor of his death, though he was one of their A&s;&s;ociation in 1729. Our &s;econd volume, p. 91. Elder Reuben Hopkins was their la&s;t mini&s;ter, who died in Janu|ary, 1792. Elder Peter Place was in their church in Smithfield in 1731, where now is elder John Win|&s;on. Elder Edward Mitchel was in their church in Glouce&s;ter for many years, and he died, October 22, 1795, aged 98. Elder William Bowen was a colleague with him, and now &s;ucceeds him. Elder Cooke was in their church in Cumberland, where now is elder Bollou. I &s;uppo&s;e the re&s;t of the churches in their connexion in that county have had but one mini&s;ter, and their names, with the number of their members, are given before, taken from A&s;plund's Regi&s;ter for 1794.</P>
<P N="7">VII. A few people in Glouce&s;ter met with a change about the time of the &s;eparations in Connec|ticut, and Thomas Knowlton from thence was at the &s;eparate ordination in Plainfield, September 11, 1746. A Bapti&s;t church was afterwards formed in Glouce&s;ter, and he was their mini&s;ter for a number of years. After his death, they had other preach|ers, until Mr. Jo&s;eph Win&s;or (brother to Samuel)
<PB N="226" REF="030011_0225_0FE3C0856D45B4D8">was ordained their pa&s;tor, October 31, 1763; and they pro&s;pered for a number of years under his min|i&s;try, and had &s;eventy-nine members when they joined to the Warren A&s;&s;ociation in 1782, and had &s;ome in|crea&s;e afterwards. But as many have removed into other parts of the country, and their pa&s;tor is &s;o aged as not to be able to preach, their number is much reduced, as I am informed, though I have not their pre&s;ent number. A Bapti&s;t church was formed in North-Providence, and Mr. Ezekiel Angell was ordained their pa&s;tor, June 20, 1765; and he con|tinued &s;o until his death, September 27, 1782, aged 60. Mr. Rufus Teffte, who was born March 14, 1752, was ordained their &s;econd pa&s;tor, June 16, 1784. There were but 19 members in this church when their former pa&s;tor died, but a great revival began in the fall of 1791, and prevailed much in the ea&s;t part of Smithfield, as well as in this town, and their number la&s;t June, when I was there, was 170. Many of the&s;e had been brought up in a carele&s;s neglect of all religion; but we hope that their future life may be as becometh the go&s;pel. Mr. John Hammond was baptized in 1780, began to gather a church in the town of Fo&s;ter in February, 1789, in which he was ordained in June, 1791, and they in|crea&s;ed to about ninety members in three years. There was a &s;econd Bapti&s;t church in Cumberland above thirty years ago, but they were much broken and &s;cattered for &s;ome years; though there have been revivals &s;ince, and e&s;pecially within a few years pa&s;t. A Bapti&s;t church was formed in Cran&s;ton, and Mr. Eli&s;ha Greene was ordained their pa&s;tor, July 30, 1764. He was born in Warwick, Augu&s;t 5, 1698, baptized in 1717, began to preach in 1741, and, after a u&s;eful life, died in Glouce&s;ter, October 29, 1780. This church is now very &s;mall. There is another meeting-hou&s;e in Cran&s;ton, upon the great road to Warwick, where Mr. Pitman often
<PB N="227" REF="030011_0226_0FE3C04F64D5B7D0">preaches, and a number of members from thence have joined to the Bapti&s;t church in Providence.</P>

<P N="8">VIII. Mr. John Clarke, a phy&s;ician from Lon|don, was one of the fir&s;t planters of Rhode-I&s;land, and the pa&s;tor of the &s;econd Bapti&s;t church in Amer|ica, which was formed at Newport in 1644. His brother Jo&s;eph Clarke was a member of it, and oft|en a ruler in the State, and adorned his profe&s;&s;ion for above forty years after the church was con&s;ti|tuted; and his po&s;terity are numerous and re&s;pecta|ble unto this day. Samuel Hubbard was born in England in 1610, came over to Salem in 1633, join|ed to the Congregational church in Watertown in 1635, but went up to Wind&s;or, and helped to begin the colony of Connecticut the &s;ame year. But as he and his wife embraced the Bapti&s;t principles, they removed to Newport, and joined with this church in 1648; and he lived there above forty years after, and pre&s;erved many writings which have been very &s;erviceable in our hi&s;tory. He left no &s;on, but he had three daughters, who were married to Jo&s;eph Clarke, junior, Robert Burdick, and Andrew Lang|worthy, who&s;e po&s;terity are re&s;pectable to this day, e&s;pecially among the Bapti&s;ts in Hopkinton. In 1651 Mr. Coddington obtained a commi&s;&s;ion from the ruling powers in England, to be governor of Rhode-I&s;land, without the con&s;ent of the people, when he had the deeds of their lands in his hands. Therefore Mr. John Clarke went to England, with Mr. Roger Williams, and got that commi&s;&s;ion di&s;|annulled; and he was agent for his colony in that country, until he procured their &s;econd charter in 1663. Mr. Hubbard wrote a letter to him, the &s;pring after he went to England, and Clarke wrote him an an&s;wer, October 11, 1652, and &s;aid, "There can be nothing in the pre&s;ent evil world, &s;o far as I
<PB N="228" REF="030011_0227_0FE3C08B1B415B20">am acquainted with my own heart as it &s;tands to Godward, that is more plea&s;ing and delightful to it, than the manife&s;tation of the enlargement of the kingdom of his dear Son, and that many obedient &s;ervants are added to the Lord, whom God the Father hath re&s;olved to exalt above every name that is named, not only in this pre&s;ent world, but in that which is to come; and that they who are &s;o added, being living members of that body which by a &s;pirit of life is joined unto that living Lord who is head over all, may increa&s;e with all the increa&s;e of God, is the earne&s;t de&s;ire and prayer of my &s;oul. But I mu&s;t tell you, that as the promi&s;e of the glorious coming of our Lord doth quicken and fre&s;hen in my heart, &s;o doth that prophecy follow in my mind, When the &s;on of man cometh, &s;hall he find faith on the earth?" He returned to Newport in 1664, and was a faithful pa&s;tor of this church, being al&s;o u&s;eful in the State, until he died in a happy frame, April 20, 1676. When Mr. Clarke &s;ailed for England in 1651, he left the care of this church with Jo&s;eph Tory, and Obadiah Holmes, and they were u&s;eful teachers therein all their days. Holmes &s;ucceeded Clarke as pa&s;tor of the church, until he died, Octo|ber 15, 1682. Mr. Richard Dingley &s;ucceeded him; but in 1694, he left them and went to South-Caro|lina. In 1710 Mr. William Peckom was ordained their pa&s;tor, and continued &s;o until he died in 1734. He was e&s;teemed as a pious man, but his gifts were &s;mall; and Mr. John Comer was ordained a col|league with him, May 19, 1726. He was born in Bo&s;ton, Augu&s;t 1, 1704, met with a happy change in November, 1721, and after obtaining a good &s;hare of human learning, he began to preach the go&s;pel at Swan&s;ea in May, 1724, and went to Newport in the fall of 1725, and preached in this church four years, in which time it increa&s;ed from &s;eventeen members to fifty-two. Yet two powerful men in the church,
<PB N="229" REF="030011_0228_0FE3C0DAAD1D4160">prevailed with the majority to vote him a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion in 1729, and he went and preached two years in the &s;econd church in Newport with con&s;iderable &s;uc|ce&s;s, and then removed and gathered the fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church in Rehoboth, where he died, as we before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ted. Mr. John Callender, who was born in Bo&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, and was educated at the college in Cambridge, was the next pa&s;tor of this church, where he was ordained, October 13, 1731, colleague with elder <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">kom. He was a man of &s;uperior powers, and publi&s;hed a century &s;ermon in 1738, and a funeral &s;ermon for Mr. Clap, the fir&s;t Congregational min|i&s;ter in Newport, in 1745, with &s;ome other things. He al&s;o collected many papers, which have been &s;er|viceable in our hi&s;tory. But he was taken away by death, January 26, 1748, in the 42d year of his age. Mr. Edward Upham, of Springfield, at the reque&s;t of this church, removed to Newport in 1749, and mini&s;tered to them until April, 1771, when he returned back to Springfield, as we before related. Mr. Era&s;mus Kelly, who was born in Penn|&s;ylvania, July 24, 1748, educated at the college in Philadelphia, and began to preach in tho&s;e parts, was called to Newport, and was ordained a pa&s;tor of this church, October 9, 1771. And the church and &s;ociety increa&s;ed under his mini&s;try, until the enemy came to Newport, and he removed to Warren, where they followed him, and burnt the hou&s;e and goods where he re&s;ided, May 25, 1778. He then removed to Connecticut, and from thence to Penn&s;ylvania. But upon the return of peace, he came again to Newport, and mini&s;tered to this church, until he was taken away by death, November 7, 1784, before he had been with them a year in this la&s;t turn. Mr. Jo&s;ias Lyndon was of this &s;ociety, and did much for the &s;upport of wor&s;hip therein. He was governor of the colony in 1769, and was very &s;erviceable in the State all his days. He died of the &s;mall-pox, March
<PB N="230" REF="030011_0229_0FE3C090B451F778">30, 1778, aged 74, leaving much of his e&s;tate to this church. The calamities of the war &s;cattered this church, and others were taken away by death, &s;o that only three male members remained at New-port, and but twenty-&s;even, male and female, re|mained any where, when Dr. Benjamin Fo&s;ter came there in January, 1785, and above twenty were add|ed to this church that year, and many to their &s;oci|ety, a number of whom attended no wor&s;hip before. In September, 1786, this church was received into the Warren A&s;&s;ociation, when they had 69 members. But in 1788 &s;ome of them rai&s;ed oppo&s;ition again&s;t their mini&s;ter, and he had an earne&s;t call to New-York; therefore he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from this church, and hath been pa&s;tor of the fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church in that city ever &s;ince. After various trials, this church obtained Mr. Michael Eddy, who was ordained in Swan&s;ea, in 1785, but removed to Newport in Jan|uary, 1790, and he is now their pa&s;tor, and they have pro&s;pered under his mini&s;try.</P>
<P N="9">IX. The doctrine of laying on of hands upon every member, came into the fir&s;t church in New-port in 1652, and the &s;econd church was formed about 1656. Mr. William Vaughan was their fir&s;t pa&s;tor, and continued &s;o until his death in Augu&s;t, 1677. Mr. Thomas Baker &s;ucceeded him for a time, and then he removed and began a &s;ociety in North-King&s;ton. Mr. John Harden was their third pa&s;tor, who died in the year 1700. Mr. James Clarke was the next, who was ordained in 1701, and continued with them until he died, December 1, 1736, aged 87. Mr. Daniel Wightman was or|dained a colleague with him in 1704. He was born in Narragan&s;et, January 2, 1668, and died in New-port Augu&s;t 31, 1750. They were well e&s;teemed among their brethren, as faithful mini&s;ters, and ex|emplary walkers; and in January, 1729, when elder Clarke was not able to preach, through the infirmi|ties
<PB N="231" REF="030011_0230_0FE3C0E0B8B7ED90">of age, Mr. Comer was received to preach one half of the Lord's days with elder Wightman, and continued to do &s;o for two years. Their church in|crea&s;ed to 142 members, being the large&s;t church then in their colony. They had built the fir&s;t meet|ing-hou&s;e in the colony, in 1707. On June 21, 1729, they had the large&s;t A&s;&s;ociation of Bapti&s;t mini&s;ters and churches that ever had been &s;een in America. The elders pre&s;ent were, James Clarke, Daniel Wightman, and John Comer, of Newport, Jonathan Sprague and James Brown, of Providence, Nicholas Eyers of New-York, Valentine Wightman of Groton, Philip Tabor of Dartmouth, Stephen Gorton of New-London, and Daniel Everet of South-King&s;ton. Be&s;ide whom the elders, Peter Place of Smithfield, Samuel Fi&s;k of Scituate, Jo&s;eph Ma&s;on of Swan&s;ea, Mana&s;&s;ah Martin of Warwick, and Richard Sweet of North-King&s;ton, were in their connexion of churches; and Mr. Comer &s;ays, "Each of the&s;e hold to general redemption. Three other churches hold to the doctrine of free grace. One in Newport, formerly my flock; one at Swan|&s;ea, Mr. Ephraim Whea&s;on; one at Bo&s;ton, Mr. Eli&s;ha Callender." And the&s;e, with one at New-port, and one at We&s;terly, who kept the &s;eventh day, were all the Bapti&s;t churches then in New-En|gland. Comer gave his ideas of election in the&s;e words, &s;aying, "If God does not choo&s;e us, we &s;hall never be moved to choo&s;e him. It is from his choice of us that we are led to choo&s;e him. 1 Pet. ii. 9.2 The&s;&s;. ii. 13. They are cho&s;en to obedience, and not for obedience. 1 Peter i. 2. We are cho&s;en not in time upon works, but before time exclu&s;ive. Eph. i. 4. All is rich, &s;overeign, free and pure grace in God through Chri&s;t."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Comer's Diary.</NOTE> But as &s;ome would not hear him preach this doctrine there, he removed to Rehoboth, and elder Nicholas Eyres came to Newport in Octo|ber,
<PB N="232" REF="030011_0231_0FE3C0959BE8DDF0">1731, and was a pa&s;tor of this church until <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> death, February 13, 1759. He was born in En|gland, Augu&s;t 22, 1691, educated in the city of Bri&s;tol, came over to New-York about 1711, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> baptized and ordained there in 1724, but his church broke up in 1730, and he had great influence among the&s;e churches as long as he lived, and he left many manu&s;cripts, &s;ome of which have been &s;erviceable in our hi&s;tory. His &s;on, Dr. Thomas Eyres, was edu|cated at Yale college, and was one of the fir&s;t fel|lows of our college. Mr. Gardner Thur&s;ton was born in Newport, November 21, 1721, met with a change and joined to this church in 1741, and was ordained their pa&s;tor, April 29, 1759. The doc|trines of grace gradually gained ground in this church, and &s;inging in public wor&s;hip was intro|duced into it in 1765, and many ble&s;&s;ings have been granted among them &s;ince. Dr. William Rogers, one of the fir&s;t cla&s;s in our college, was called to preach in this church, and he went to Phil|adelphia in 1771, where he has been u&s;eful ever &s;ince. Elder Burroughs, of Tiverton, and elder Jones, of Rehoboth, &s;prang al&s;o from this church. Their pa&s;tor continued with them through all the calamities of the war, and is &s;till u&s;eful to old age.</P>
<P N="10">X. The third Bapti&s;t church in Newport was formed in the following manner. Stephen Mum|ford came over from London in 1664, and brought the opinion with him, that the whole of the ten com|mandments, as they were delivered from mount Si|nai, were moral and immutable; and that it was the antichri&s;tian power, which thought to change times and laws, that changed the Sabbath from the &s;eventh to the fir&s;t day of the week. Several members of the fir&s;t church in Newport embraced this &s;entiment, and yet continued with the church for &s;ome years, until two men and their wives, who had &s;o done, turned back to the keeping of the fir&s;t day again.
<PB N="233" REF="030011_0232_0FE3C0E7908B5DE8">But they who believed that this practice came from antichri&s;t, were much concerned about it, and wrote <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> their friends in England for advice thereon.

Thomas Ward was an early member of this church, who&s;e &s;on Richard was governor of the colony in 1741, 1742; and-his &s;on Samuel was governor in 1762 and 1765, and a member of Congre&s;s in 1774 and 1775, until he died at Philadelphia, March 26, 1776, aged 52. Each of the&s;e were members of this church. Mr. William Bli&s;s was called to preach the go&s;pel by this church before the American war, and he continued with them through the war, and preached frequently on the i&s;land when the Briti&s;h forces were there, from whom he &s;uffered much.

<P N="11">XI. There have been a number of Bapti&s;ts in Newport for many years, who did not agree fully with either of the old churches in &s;ome things, but who&s;e to meet by them&s;elves, and to call elders from abroad to mini&s;ter occa&s;ionally to them, until they formed another church in the town.

<P N="12">XII. Elder Philip Tabor was pa&s;tor of the Bapti&s;t church in Tiverton and Dartmouth, before he was impri&s;oned at Bri&s;tol for not favouring mini&s;terial tyranny. Both of the&s;e towns were under the Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;ette government until 1741; and becau&s;e the majority of the inhabitants would not receive and &s;upport Congregational mini&s;ters, a &s;alary for &s;uch was put into their State tax, and they were to draw is out of the State trea&s;ury. But their a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors being informed of it, left that part of the tax on tho&s;e two towns out of their a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment. Tabor was one of them, and he, with three a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors more, were &s;eized on May 25, 1723, and were impri&s;oned at Bri&s;tol until an agent went over to London, and procured their relea&s;e by an order from the king and council. Our &s;econd volume, p. 70&mdash;73. He lived within the bounds of Dartmouth, but their meeting was held in the ea&s;t part of Tiverton, where he mini&s;ter|ed to this Bapti&s;t church, until he died in November, 1752. Mr. David Round was born in Rehoboth,
<PB N="236" REF="030011_0235_0FE3C13D33AD4368">in January, 1706, and was ordained the next pa&s;tor of this church about 1755, and mini&s;tered to them for many years, and is now living among them, and e&s;teemed as a pious man. But as his gifts were &s;mall, the church called Mr. Peleg Burroughs, from the &s;econd church in Newport to preach to them in May, 1775, and he was ordained their pa&s;tor, April 13, 1780. A happy rain of righteou&s;ne&s;s was then grant|ed among them, which cau&s;ed the addition of about an hundred members in two years. Elder Burroughs was born in Newport, June 5, 1748, converted in 1766, and began to preach in 1774; and he is &s;till continued with this church. That revival of relig|ion cau&s;ed the gathering of a Bapti&s;t church in the &s;outh borders of Freetown, February 15, 1781, and Mr. Amos Burris, from Groton, in Connecticut, was in&s;talled their pa&s;tor, May 22, 1783. But in October, 1784, he removed into the State of Ver|mont, and they removed their meeting into the north borders of Tiverton, where it now is; and two men were rai&s;ed up to preach among them, who were unitedly ordained as their pa&s;tors, May 19, 1796, namely, James Boomer and Job Barden. The latter is blind, as to natural fight, but he hath &s;uch &s;pirit|ual light as to be e&s;teemed a clear preacher of the go&s;pel.

Warren was a part of the town of Swan&s;ea, and a number of the members of the fir&s;t church there were formed into a church in Warren, October 15, 1764, and Dr. Manning was their min|i&s;ter until he removed to Providence in 1770, as we before ob&s;erved. After &s;ome time, this church ob|tained Mr. Charles Thomp&s;on to preach to them, and he was ordained their pa&s;tor, July 3, 1771. He was born at Amwell, in New-Jer&s;ey, April 14, 1748, was one of the fir&s;t graduates in our college at War|ren in 1769; and &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing was granted on his mini&s;try there as to increa&s;e the church from fifty to eighty-three members in four years.

<P N="15">XV. The fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church in the county of Wa&s;hington was in North-King&s;ton. Elder Baker <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent from Newport, and began a meeting there to|wards the clo&s;e of the la&s;t century, as Mr. Comer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> us; and a paper of their own, dates the be|ginning of their church about 1710. Mr. Richard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">cot was their pa&s;tor for many years, and lived till after 1740. Mr. David Sprague was ordained a col|league with him about 1739. The great awaken|ings in other parts of the country, in and after 1741, affected a number of people in the&s;e parts, which cau&s;ed various controver&s;ies. The laying on of hands upon every member had been carried &s;o far, as not to allow their members to hear any others pray or preach. And when Mr. Bound, of Bo&s;ton, met elder Wightman, of Groton, at Warwick, in 1743, the elders with whom he was connected oppo&s;ed his
<PB N="240" REF="030011_0239_0FE3C0F5CFAB2B60">acting in the ordination; and Mr. John Callender, of Newport, wrote an unfavourable account of it to England, and al&s;o of the work then going on in the land, and &s;aid, "I have &s;een no cau&s;e to alter the opinion I early entertained of Mr. Whitefield, this he was a &s;econd George Fox." But all experience &s;ince hath evidenced his great mi&s;take. For the plan of doctrine which Whitefield held forth was directly oppo&s;ite to that which Fox taught, and he ever appeared again&s;t the idea of rai&s;ing any new &s;ect in the world, and exerted all his powers to re|vive pure religion, according to the holy &s;criptures, among all &s;orts of people whereever he came, and left the government of churches to others. But Mr. We&s;ley and his followers have been exceeding zeal|ous for the doctrines which Fox held, and to rai&s;e a new &s;ect under another name. The work which began in the year 1740, naturally cau&s;ed oppo&s;ition to ari&s;e in all who were &s;ettled down in formality, of every denomination. And the general meeting of the Bapti&s;t churches at Newport, September <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, 1749, &s;ent an addre&s;s to their brethren, in which they &s;aid, "We have endeavoured to promote and maintain general peace and unity among the broth|erhood, and have not been altogether un&s;ucce&s;sful; and we heartily de&s;ire that the fruits and effects of our endeavours may diffu&s;e and &s;pread them&s;elves abroad in other places, and throughout the churches. And though we &s;hould have been glad to have had the company and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of more of our mini&s;ters and brethren, to carry on and encourage the great work of our Redeemer's kingdom; yet we who are a&s;|&s;embled in our general meeting, according to our gen|eral character, do take courage in the Lord to con&s;id|er by what means the general intere&s;t and peace of the churches might be promoted, and grieve at any mea&s;ures or &s;teps that were or had been taken, by which the &s;ame were le&s;&s;ened and impaired.

Elder Sprague had been much engaged in preaching up the doc|trines which had promoted the late revival of relig|i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> in this country, and he a&s;&s;i&s;ted in ordaining Mr. Samuel Drown, as pa&s;tor of a Bapti&s;t church lately formed in Coventry, October 11, 1749, where he met with &s;everal &s;eparate mini&s;ters from Connecti|cut, and invited them to come and preach among his people, which they did with great effects. And on April 4, 1750, Sprague acted with Mr. Paine, in ordaining Mr. Stephen Babcock as pa&s;tor of a Bap|ti&s;t church in We&s;terly. And upon the&s;e things, above &s;eventy members of this church, male and fe|male, &s;igned a paper in May, 1750, to &s;hut him out of their meeting-hou&s;e, and he went and gathered a church in Exeter. Mr. James Wightman was after|wards ordained a pa&s;tor of this church, and remain|ed &s;o until his death in the &s;pring of 1791. Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">han Hill was ordained a colleague with him in 1781, and &s;till continues in that office. And for &s;ame years pa&s;t they have received men to preach in their meeting-hou&s;e, who have held forth the doc|trine that was &s;hut out of it in 1750. A church was firmed in connexion with them in Richmond, and Mr. John Pendleton was ordained their pa&s;tor in June, 1771; and Mr. Henry Jo&s;lin &s;ucceeds him therein.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. Hopkinton was once the north part of We&s;terly, where &s;ome of Mr. Clarke's church lived, before the &s;eparation on account of the Sabbath took place in 1671. Mr. John Crandal was one of them, who was impri&s;oned with Clarke and Holmes at Bo&s;|ton,
<PB N="242" REF="030011_0241_0FE3C0FD0F9866B0">in 1651. He was called over to New-London, and baptized &s;ome men there in 1674, for which the mini&s;ter of the town threatened him with a pro&s;ecu|tion the next court; and "old Mrs. Rogers was laid under admonition for maintaining that children had no right to bapti&s;m." In 1678 Mr. Hubbard wrote to a friend in Jamaica, and &s;aid, "Our num|ber here is twenty, at We&s;terly &s;even, and at New-London ten." On December 7, 1681, he wrote to England, that two Indians came to Newport that week from Nantucket, who were Bapti&s;ts, and one of them a preacher, with "a letter of recommenda|tion from one Peter Folger, a member of our old church," that is, of Mr. Clarke's church. This preacher was going over to Soconet to preach to the Indians there, of which captain Church had given them notice, Thomas We&s;t and his wife, and an|other Engli&s;h woman, and two Indians, of Martha's Vineyard, had joined to this church at Newport be|fore; and on January 28, 1682, Hubbard wrote to Providence, and &s;aid, "There is a brother here, of Martha's Vineyard, one I&s;aac Takkamme, an Indian, who brings word that all are well there; brother We&s;t and his wife, and &s;i&s;ter Rogers, and our broth|er David Okes, an Indian, and that they &s;tand fa&s;t in the faith." I&s;aac Decamy was afterwards pa&s;tor of a Bapti&s;t church among the Indians there, who might be the &s;ame per&s;on. Our fir&s;t volume, p. 438. In 1708 the brethren at We&s;terly were amicably di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed, and formed a church there. I have not ob|tained an exact account of their mini&s;ters &s;ince, though I find by Mr. Comer that Mr. Jo&s;eph Maxon was their pa&s;tor in 1729, and Mr. Thomas Hi&s;cox was a preacher among them; and he was a mini&s;ter there to old age. Mr. Jo&s;hua Clarke was a mini&s;ter at Hopkinton for many years, and died in June, 1792. And by a letter from Rhode-I&s;land, Septem|ber 11, 1795, we are informed that "The church

At the &s;ame time and place, Henry Clarke, (&s;on of the late elder Jo&s;hua Clarke) was ordained an evangeli&s;t. Al&s;o A&s;a Coon was ordained an evangeli&s;t the &s;ame day. Three churches have been &s;et off from this church at Hopkinton in fellow&s;hip in fifteen years. One at Bri&s;tol, in Connecticut, con|&s;tituted in September, 1780, formerly under the care of the Reverend John Davis, decea&s;ed, of about &s;ev|enty members.

<P N="17">XVII. Mr. David Sprague was born at Hingham, in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and was converted at Scituate, in this State, where he joined to the Bapti&s;t church under the care of elder Fi&s;k. As he was a man of &s;uperior gifts, he was invited to preach among them; but a &s;en&s;e of the greatne&s;s of the work made him afraid to attempt it, until a pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture was opened with peculiar clearne&s;s to his mind, and then he came forward and delivered a &s;ermon. This was very agreeable to his mini&s;ter, and to the people; but when he preached his &s;econd di&s;cour&s;e, they ob&s;erv|ed more the tenor of his teaching, and &s;aid to him, "If you go on in this way, you will be as bad an <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lectioner</HI> as any of the Pre&s;byterians." This account I received from his own mouth; and he informed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, that their oppo&s;ition turned him back into their
<PB N="244" REF="030011_0243_0FE3C101C8078AC0">general way of preaching, for a number of years. And his coming forward in preaching as he was fir&s;t taught, cau&s;ed his being &s;hut out of the church where he was fir&s;t ordained, and another was formed at Exeter, in the fall of 1750. But as they had before made &s;o much of external bapti&s;m and laying on of hands, they now went over to the other extreme and received one or more to the ordinance of the &s;upper without any water bapti&s;m. The powerful effects of the preaching of &s;eparate mini&s;ters from Connecticut, had a great influence to cau&s;e this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in their minds; and an acquaintance with lively Bapti&s;t mini&s;ters, al&s;o removed the prejudices again&s;t the Bapti&s;ts, from the minds of many in Connecticut, and many were &s;oon baptized, and it &s;eemed as though all their &s;eparate churches would become Bapti&s;ts. But this rai&s;ed &s;uch oppo&s;ition to whom they called <HI>re-baptizing,</HI> in the mind of the pa&s;tor of the &s;eparate church in Canterbury, where the &s;epar|ation began, that he, with others, prevailed with &s;ev|en or eight teachers to retract their bapti&s;m by im|mer&s;ion. And a council of them cen&s;ured the pa&s;|tor of the fir&s;t &s;eparate church in Middleborough, becau&s;e he refu&s;ed to follow that example. But this cen&s;ure cau&s;ed the meeting of the delegates of twen|ty-&s;even churches at Exeter, May 23, 1753, who condemned the cen&s;uring of each other on either &s;ide. Our &s;econd volume, p. 210, 211. Though the divi&s;ions and controver&s;ies that have appeared where believer's bapti&s;m hath been introduced, hath been held up as a &s;trong argument again&s;t it from age to age. In 1653 Mr. Henry Dun&s;ter, pre&s;ident of the college at Cambridge, gave up infant bapti&s;m, and preached again&s;t it in the pulpit there. But Mr. Jonathan Mitchel, pa&s;tor of their church, went to talk with him upon it, after which he &s;aid, "I had a &s;trange experience; I found hurrying and pre&s;&s;ing &s;ugge&s;tions again&s;t pedobapti&s;m, and injected &s;cruples
<PB N="245" REF="030011_0244_0FE3C12974D04768">and thoughts whether the other way might not be right, and infant bapti&s;m an invention of men, and whether I might with a good con&s;cience baptize children, and the like. And the&s;e thoughts were darted in with &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion, and left a &s;trange confu&s;ion and &s;ickline&s;s upon my &s;pirit. Yet, me|thought, it was not hard to di&s;cern that they were from the EVIL ONE. 1. Becau&s;e they were rather injected, hurrying &s;ugge&s;tions, than any deliberate thoughts, or bringing any light with them. 2. Be|cau&s;e they were <HI>un&s;ea&s;onable,</HI> interrupting me in my &s;tudy for the Sabbath, and putting my &s;pirit into con|fu&s;ion, &s;o as I had much ado to do aught in my &s;er|mon. It was not now a time to &s;tudy that matter; but when in the former part of the week I had given my&s;elf to that &s;tudy, the more I &s;tudied it, the more clear and rational light I &s;aw for pedobapti&s;m; but now the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions hurried me into &s;cruples. But they made me cry out to God for his help, and he did afterward calm and clear up my &s;pirit. I thought the end of them was, Fir&s;t, to &s;hew me the corrup|tion of my mind; how apt that was to take in error, even as my heart is to take in lu&s;t. Secondly, to make me walk in fear, and to take hold on Je&s;us Chri&s;t to keep me in the truth; and it was a check to my former &s;elf-confidence, and it made me fearful to go needle&s;sly to Mr. Dun&s;ter; for, methought, I found a venom and poi&s;on in his in&s;inuations and di&s;|cour&s;es again&s;t pedobapti&s;m. Thirdly, that I might be mindful of the aptne&s;s in others to be &s;oon &s;haken in mind, and that I might warn others thereof, and might know how to &s;peak to them from experience. And indeed my former experience of irreligious in|jections, was &s;ome help to me to di&s;cover the nature of the&s;e. I re&s;olved al&s;o on Mr. Hooker's principle, that I would have an argument able to remove a mountain, before I would recede from, or appear again&s;t a truth or practice received among the faith|ful."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mitchel's Life, p. 69, 70.</NOTE>

Mr. Cleaveland was expelled out of New-Haven col|lege in 1744, for meeting for wor&s;hip on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ord's day in a hou&s;e &s;eparate from the pari&s;h meeting-hou&s;e in Canterbury, with the fir&s;t Con|gregational church in that town, who had refu&s;|ed to receive a teacher whom the world would have forced upon them.

The church in Exeter pro&s;pered under the mini&s;try of elder Sprague for about ten years, and then he gave up communion in the ordinance of the &s;upper with all who were only &s;prinkled in infancy, which cau&s;ed his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from this church.

But in a few years after he &s;aw &s;uch oppo&s;ition in his mini&s;ter and others, again&s;t what he believed to be the pow|er of godline&s;s, that he withdrew and &s;et up a meet|ing at his own hou&s;e, and a church was gathered there, and he was ordained their pa&s;tor, April 4, 1750; in who&s;e ordination elder David Sprague and elder Solomon Paine united, it being the fir&s;t in&s;tance of the two denominations uniting in &s;uch an action among the&s;e churches. Elder Babcock was zealous for &s;uch a union all his days, while oth|ers renounced it. He died after the war began in 1775. His &s;on Oliver Babcock was his &s;ucce&s;&s;or in that office until he died, February 13, 1784. His cou&s;in Elkanah Babcock was their next mini&s;ter, un|til the majority of the church rejected him becau&s;e of his turning off into corrupt principles. In the mean time another church was gathered in We&s;terly, about the year 1770, and Mr. I&s;aiah Wilcox was ordained their pa&s;tor, who was very zealous for the communion of the two denominations together, and they were a large church when he died in March, 1793. In the fall of 1750, &s;uch a church was form|ed in South-King&s;ton, and Mr. James Rogers was or|dained their pa&s;tor, and he continued &s;o about twen|ty years; but he had entangled him&s;elf &s;o much in the affairs of this life, and was involved &s;o deeply in debt, that he went off into the State of New-York, and his church was divided and di&s;&s;olved. A num|ber of them, who &s;till hold to mixed communion, have lately had a revival among them, to whom oth|ers have joined, and they are of the Groton confer|ence. But in the work which began in 1778, a number gave up mixed communion, and formed a church there, and Mr. Benjamin Weight was or|dained
<PB N="248" REF="030011_0247_0FE3C10D0BDCF108">their pa&s;tor, in Augu&s;t, 1781, in which office he is yet continued. Another church aro&s;e out of the ruins of the former about 1774, who &s;ince meet in Richmond, and Mr. Benjamin Barber was or|dained their pa&s;tor in 1793. In another part of Richmond a new church was formed, and Mr. Charles Bo&s;s was ordained their pa&s;tor in June, 1781, and he was well e&s;teemed in his office until his death in 1789. The&s;e three churches do not hold to mixed communion. But when the church in Exeter gave up that practice, deacon Philip Jen|kins drew off from them, and gathered a church in that way, July 21, 1764, and he was ordained their pa&s;|tor the 6th of September following, and is &s;till contin|ued with them. Their meeting is in North-King&s;ton. And in the glorious year 1780, religion was revived in the &s;outh part of that town, and a new church was gathered, and Mr. William Northup was ordained their pa&s;tor in 1782, and they are now a large church. An Indian Bapti&s;t church was formed in Charle&s;|town, in this county, above thirty years ago, of which James Symons was pa&s;tor, and then Samuel Niles; and they had many valuable Chri&s;tians there|in;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In 1784 Niles's church had about fifty members.</NOTE> but mo&s;t of them are &s;ince dead, and the church is di&s;&s;olved. The chief of the Indians who are living have removed into the State of New-York.</P>

<P N="19">XIX. The fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church in this county was in Warwick, and Mr. Mana&s;&s;eh Martin was their mini&s;ter, before 1730. In a letter from gov|ernor Jencks, in February that year, he &s;ays, "I have often heard, that elder Martin denied that Chri&s;t re|ceived any part of the human nature of the virgin Mary, in who&s;e womb he was conceived, and by whom he was born into the world." He held Je&s;us to be the only begotten Son of God, but held his humanity in a my&s;tical way, which cau&s;ed much un|ea&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="249" REF="030011_0248_0FE3C13248040080">among his brethren, excepting elder Everet, who appeared to be of his mind. Mr. Charles Hol|den &s;ucceeded Martin, and was pa&s;tor of this church for many years; and Mr. Abraham Lippet was or|dained therein in October, 1782; but in 1794 he removed into the State of New-York, and Mr. Sam|uel Littlefield was ordained in his place at Warwick. The church in Ea&s;t-Greenwich was formed, and Mr. Daniel Fi&s;k was ordained their pa&s;tor in June, 1743. He was &s;on to elder Fi&s;k, of Scituate; and he mini&s;tered to this church about four years, and then was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed and went and preached in vari|ous places, until he died with the &s;mall-pox in Swan|&s;ea in 1764. Mr. John Gorton was born in Cran&s;|ton, April 22, 1723, and was ordained a pa&s;tor of this church, September 6, 1753; and he was an acceptable mini&s;ter among them until his death, in 1793. And Mr. Manche&s;ter, of Coventry, now mini&s;tereth al&s;o to this church. Mr. Timothy Greene was formerly the pa&s;tor of a Bapti&s;t church in Coventry; wherein Mr. Thomas Manche&s;ter was ordained, September 12, 1782. A church was formed in the we&s;t part of Warwick, in connexion with the&s;e, and Mr. David Corpe was ordained their mini&s;ter in 1791. A Bapti&s;t church had been form|ed in the &s;ame place about fifty years ago, and Mr. Benjamin Peirce was ordained their pa&s;tor, and they came into fellow&s;hip with Exeter church and others in 1750. And they increa&s;ed &s;o much, that Mr. Peter Werden was ordained a colleague with him, May 21, 1751. And he laboured there until April, 1757, when he removed up to Coventry, by the con&s;ent of the church. After Mr. Peirce's death, Mr. Budlong was their mini&s;ter for a while, and then this church was di&s;&s;olved, and many of them removed into other parts of the country. There was a powerful work in Coventry in 1748, and a Bapti&s;t church was formed there, and Mr. Samuel
<PB N="250" REF="030011_0249_0FE3C1372D0669B8">Drown was ordained their pa&s;tor, October 11, 1749. But in a few years he gave up his Bapti&s;t principles, and went and &s;ettled at Port&s;mouth, in New-Hamp|&s;hire, where he practi&s;ed inform bapti&s;m the remain|der of his days. He died there January 17, 1770. After elder Werden removed to Coventry, he min|i&s;tered to the church there for twelve years, in which time many were hopefully converted, and Chri&s;tians were built up in the ways of God, and then, as a large part of his people had removed, he al&s;o went and &s;ettled where he now is in Berk&s;hire. The we&s;t part of Coventry, and or the towns adjacent, had very little of the appearance of religion among them, until God was plea&s;ed to pour out his Spirit upon them in the beginning of 1773. Mr. Caleb Nichols was greatly ble&s;&s;ed in his labours there afterwards. He was born in We&s;t-Greenwich in March, 1743, met with a change in 1767, and be|gan to preach among this people in 1773, and a church was formed, and he was ordained their pa&s;tor in June, 1774. When the war came on it produced many evil effects; yet in May, 1779, &s;uch a revival of religion was granted in the&s;e parts, that he baptized above &s;ixty in two months, and his church increa&s;ed to three hundred members in five years. But in the great &s;hakings and confu&s;ion which took place in 1786, this church was &s;cattered, and many removed into other parts of the land, and elder Nichols was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed in the &s;pring of 1788, and went and &s;ettled at Pownal, in Vermont, where he is &s;till u&s;eful. Mr. Nathaniel Price was rai&s;ed up to preach to this church, and he now holds meetings with &s;ome of them at the hou&s;e where elder Werden formerly preached, and Mr. John Ben&s;on preaches where Nichols did, though neither of them are or|dained. A Bapti&s;t church was formed in We&s;t-Greenwich in 1773, and Mr. Eli&s;ha Greene was ordained their pa&s;tor, September 21, 1775, and re|mains &s;o &s;till.</P>

XX. A few general remarks &s;hall clo&s;e this chap|ter. The multiplicity of &s;ects in this State, has oft|en been advanced as an argument again&s;t the relig|ions liberty which was granted therein; but there are now about at many &s;ects in the town of Bo&s;ton, as there are in the whole State of Rhode-I&s;land. There are &s;ome in Bo&s;ton who pray for &s;ouls in pur|gatory, while others boldly preach up the fire of hell as that which will finally purge away all &s;in, without the prayers of any in this world. And the&s;e things are carried the highe&s;t in Bo&s;ton and Philadelphia, of any part of America. A party &s;pirit, and bribe|ry in election of rulers, were formerly laid as a great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">proach on the colony of Rhode-I&s;land; but our land is full of the&s;e evils now, and they have been varried as high as any where in the town of Bo&s;ton. Our land hath al&s;o been filled, in the year pa&s;t, with publications again&s;t our highe&s;t rulers, becau&s;e a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> was &s;ent to England, and made a treaty with the rulers there, which gives them more power here than they had before. But in the year 1786 two mini&s;ters came over with commi&s;&s;ions from the bi&s;h|ops in England, and they have made other bi&s;hops the mo&s;t of the United States, to whom monies and &s;tands are given by governments; yet mo&s;t men are &s;ilent about the&s;e things, or el&s;e commend them as evidences of candour and catholici&s;m in our land. Whereas the bi&s;hops, and their mini&s;try in England, who have been &s;upported by law, have had more in|fluence in their late wars again&s;t liberty in America and France, than all other men in their nation. But as the government of Rhode-I&s;land never grant|ed any lands to religious mini&s;ters, nor &s;upported any by tax, all the power of the church of England has rai&s;ed no more than four of their &s;ocieties in the whole State, and one of them is now nearly di&s;&s;olved, if not quite.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">And bi&s;hop Seabury, who claimed a power there, died in March, 1796, &s;tate the fir&s;t part of this book was printed.</NOTE> Governor Jencks was a leader in
<PB N="252" REF="030011_0251_0FE3C032DD4FCCA8">making the law in 1716, to exclude all &s;ueing for mini&s;ters &s;alaries from their courts, though he was in earne&s;t to have the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t &s;upported voluntarily. Our &s;econd volume, p. 48, 114. But a cu&s;tom was introduced into their government in 1770, of incorporating &s;ocieties to collect and man|age funds of money for the &s;upport of religious mini&s;ters; and the hope of obtaining &s;uch a fund in Mr. Snow's congregation in Providence, was an evident motive for the ordination there in 1793; which &s;hut him out of a hou&s;e that he had as ju&s;t a right in, as any mini&s;ter has to any hou&s;e for wor&s;hip in our land. And the four mini&s;ters from the Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts, who acted in that affair, are far from al|lowing the people in their own government a power to di&s;mi&s;s their mini&s;ter without his own con&s;ent, or el&s;e the advice of a council whom he had a voice in calling. And according to the word of God, the only mini&s;ters who are to be followed, hold forth Chri&s;t in their conver&s;ation, the &s;ame ye&s;terday, and to-day, and forever, and are willing in all things to live hone&s;tly. Heb. xiii. 7, 8, 18. But how can any man live hone&s;tly, who eats the bread of others for nought? 2 The&s;&s;. iii. 7&mdash;10. And how can a people live hone&s;tly, if they require their mini&s;ter to go a warfare at his own charges? 1 Cor. ix. 7&mdash;14. Each of which iniquities have long prevailed under the ma&s;k of religion, beyond what they could po&s;&s;i|bly have done in any other way.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. CONNECTICUT hath ever had the privilege of choo&s;ing her own rulers, and of making her own laws, as well as Rhode-I&s;land; and mini&s;terial influ|ence was much more mild there at fir&s;t, than it has been in our days. John Hames was the governor of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay in 1635, and pronounced the &s;entence of bani&s;hment again&s;t Roger Williams; but he and Mr. Thomas Hooker went up to Connecticut &s;oon after. And when Williams was at his hou&s;e at Hartford, Haines &s;aid to him, "I mu&s;t confe&s;s to you, that the mo&s;t wi&s;e God hath provided and cut out this part of his world for a refuge and receptacle for all forts of con&s;ciences. I am now under a cloud, and my brother Hooker, with the Bay, as you have been, We have removed from them thus far, and yet they are not &s;atisfied."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;torical Collections at Bo&s;ton, Vol. 1. p. 280.</NOTE> No, nor ever could be &s;atisfied in that way. For in 1708, a governor who had been a mini&s;ter, and came from the Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts, obtained an act to &s;et up mini&s;ters above all their churches. And in 1742, their mini&s;ters pro|cured
<PB N="254" REF="030011_0253_0FE3C141CD4BCF00">a law to puni&s;h every man who &s;hould preach the go&s;pel in any pari&s;h, without the con&s;ent of the pari&s;h mini&s;ter. And as Mr. John Owen, pa&s;tor of the fir&s;t pari&s;h in Groton, ventured to preach again&s;t &s;uch proceedings, he was complained of to the legi&s;|lature at Hartford in May, 1743, and an act was pa&s;&s;ed to bring him before them the next October. A re&s;olve was al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed, that no per&s;ons of the Pre&s;byterian or Congregational denominations &s;hould have the benefit of the act of toleration, granted to di&s;&s;enters from their e&s;tabli&s;hment, and that no courts below the legi&s;lature &s;hould have power to admit any to that privilege. Owen avoided being taken in October, when a law was made again&s;t the preach|ing of any itinerant mini&s;ter who might come from any other government. And as a complaint was entered again&s;t Dr. Benjamin Pomroy, of Hebron, for preaching again&s;t their laws, both he and Owen were ordered to be brought before them the next May. And in May, 1744, both of them were brought before the a&s;&s;embly at Hartford, and were compelled to make a confe&s;&s;ion for &s;aid preaching, to pay co&s;ts of pro&s;ecution, and Pomroy was bound to his good behaviour. And in the December fol|lowing, the mini&s;ters of Windham county ordained a mini&s;ter for the fir&s;t pari&s;h in Canterbury, again&s;t the vote of the church there; which began the &s;ep|arations in our country, from &s;uch mini&s;ters and their churches. And how can any men be ju&s;tly blamed for &s;eparating from tho&s;e who claimed a power above the churches of Chri&s;t?</P>
<P N="2">II. The fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church in Connecticut was form|ed in Groton about 1705. Elder Valentine Wight|man came from North-King&s;ton, and &s;ettled in Gro|ton, and was the fir&s;t pa&s;tor of this church. They &s;uf|fered for a while from the ruling party; but in the glorious year 1741, he and Mr. Owen were agreed in the work which was then going on in the land, and they enjoyed liberty until elder Wightman was taken
<PB N="255" REF="030011_0254_0FE3C1B8ACA2C200">away by death, June 9, 1747, aged 66. He intro|duced &s;inging in public wor&s;hip into his church, and publi&s;hed a pamphlet to defend it. And being call|ed to preach in Lyme, Mr. Bulkley, of Colche&s;ter, came and held a di&s;pute with him upon bapti&s;m and the &s;upport of go&s;pel mini&s;ters, June 7, 1727, of which Bulkley publi&s;hed an account, and Wightman an|&s;wered it. Our &s;econd volume, p. 89, 90. After his death the church called elder Daniel Fi&s;k to be their mini&s;ter, and he continued with them &s;even years; but they were then &s;o much divided, that many of them gave a new declaration of their experiences, and &s;igned new articles of faith and a covenant, June 28, 1754, and elected Mr. Timothy Wightman to be their pa&s;tor, and he was ordained as &s;uch, May 20, 1756, and continues &s;o &s;till. He is a &s;on of their fir&s;t pa&s;tor, and was born November 20, 1719. His brother, John Wightman, was ordained as an evan|geli&s;t by this church, June 15, 1774, and travelled and preached in various parts of the country.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Wightman was a &s;hining example of uniform piery and benevolence, until death put an end to his u&s;eful life, which he ended in the mo&s;t joyful manner at Farmington.</NOTE> A daughter of their fir&s;t pa&s;tor married a Mr. Rathbun, who hath two &s;ons and two grand&s;ons, who are or|dained Bapti&s;t mini&s;ters. Elder Timothy Wight|man's &s;on, Je&s;&s;e, is al&s;o a Bapti&s;t mini&s;ter at Spring|field. A di&s;pute aro&s;e in this church in September, 1765, about the nature of &s;piritual teaching and the improvement of gifts, upon which a divi&s;ion en&s;ued, and another church was formed, in which Mr. Silas Burris was ordained; and they held to mixed com|muion, and the Groton Conference was named from thence. But a revival of religion was granted in the mother church in 1774, which cau&s;ed the addition of thirty members to it in about a year; and anoth|er church was formed in the north part of Groton, May 25, 1775, and Mr. Rufus Allen was ordained their pa&s;tor, and they had thirty-&s;ix members in 1784. But their pa&s;tor died not long after, &s;ince which their
<PB N="256" REF="030011_0255_0FE3C14616CB2CB0">church is di&s;&s;olved. Though the fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church in Groton had &s;eventy-eight members in 1787, and they increa&s;ed to one hundred and fifty-eight in two years, and to one hundred and eighty two in 1794, be&s;ide all that have died, have been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed or ex|cluded.</P>
<P N="3">III, The &s;econd Bapti&s;t church in Connecticut was formed at New-London, and Mr. Stephen Gor|ton was ordained their pa&s;tor November 28, 1726. He was a man of con&s;iderable gifts, and was mini&s;ter there for many years; but he fell into &s;ome &s;canda|lous conduct, and his church was finally di&s;&s;olved. It was in that part of the town where the church now is, who keep the &s;eventh day as the Sabbath, of whom we have &s;poken before. In January, 1744, elder Timothy Peckom baptized &s;ome per&s;ons in the heart of the town, and &s;ome more at Saybrook, for which he was put in pri&s;on; and a church was gathered a year or two after, of the two denomina|tions together; and Mr. Noah Hammond was or|dained in this church in July, 1754, who afterwards was pa&s;tor of a church on Long-I&s;land, where he died in October, 1774. Elder Le&s;ter was al&s;o of this church, who is now at Saybrook. Another church was formed, and Mr. Jo&s;hua Mor&s;e was ordained their pa&s;tor, May 17, 1750, who in the time of the late war removed to Sandisfield, and Mr. Reuben Palmer is mini&s;ter in that place, which now is called Montville. Mr. Zadock Darrow was an early teacher in the fir&s;t of the&s;e churches, of which he hath been pa&s;tor many years. He was born in December, 1728, and his church gave up mixed communion in 1790. and there was &s;uch a revival among them in 1794 as cau&s;ed the addition of ninety-one members in one year. John Rogers began a &s;ect in this town in 1677, upon the following principles. As to language and dre&s;s they held with the Quakers, but they held the external u&s;e of bapti&s;m and the &s;upper as the Bap|ti&s;ts
<PB N="257" REF="030011_0256_0FE3C1BCECF66FE0">do. But they held that the e&s;tabli&s;hing the fir&s;t day of the week as the Sabbath was idolatry, and they took much pains to pull it down, by te&s;tifying again&s;t it, and interrupting others in their keeping it. They were al&s;o earne&s;tly &s;et again&s;t &s;upporting min|i&s;ters by law; and they &s;uffered much for their op|po&s;ition to the&s;e two practices; and they were &s;in|gular in refu&s;ing to employ any phy&s;icians in &s;ick|ne&s;s, or midwives for women in travail, holding that they were to be healed or delivered by the prayer of faith. But as a few of them were left to put an end to their own lives, and rulers have been &s;o wi&s;e of late as to avoid their former &s;everities towards them, their &s;ociety is nearly di&s;&s;olved, and many of their children are very u&s;eful men in various parts of the country. Three brethren of one family are deacons in three Bapti&s;t churches.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The work of the Spirit of God in our land in 1741, was very powerful in Stonington, where there were three Congregational &s;ocieties, with min|i&s;ters in each of them. Two of tho&s;e mini&s;ters fa|voured the work as long as their churches were in|crea&s;ed thereby; but a new piece of cloth, if put in|to an old garment, makes the rent wor&s;e, and new wine will bur&s;t old bottles, as our Lord ob&s;erves to tho&s;e who were building upon their own doings and traditions. Luke v. 31&mdash;38. Such oppo&s;ition appear|ed again&s;t the late work, and elder Wightman was &s;o clear in it, that a number of people were baptized and formed a church in Stonington, and Mr. Wait Palmer was ordained their pa&s;tor in September, 1743. And after the &s;eparation began at Canterbury, it &s;pread into Stonington, and a church was formed there, and Mr. Matthew Smith was ordained their pa&s;tor, December 10, 1746; and he continued with them until the &s;pring of 1749, and then left them and removed out of the town. And many embraced believers' bapti&s;m and went and joined to elder Bab|cock's
<PB N="258" REF="030011_0257_0FE3C14B2B5EC498">church in We&s;terly; and when Mr. Paine had determined to u&s;e all his influence to &s;top the prevalence of the Bapti&s;t principles in their &s;eparate churches, he and Babcock joined in writing letters to all their churches; and delegates from forty churches met at the hou&s;e of Mr. Simon Drown, of Stonington, May 29, 1754, and &s;pent three days in hearing the controver&s;ies between the two parties. Mr. Solomon Paine took much pains to prove, that it was a bad temper and conduct in the Bapti&s;ts that cau&s;ed the breach between him and them. But his brother, Eli&s;ha Paine, a man of much more knowledge and experience, gave it as his mind, that the difficulty &s;prang from the nature of oppo&s;ite principles. For &s;prinkling of infants, upon the faith of their parents, and burying of believers upon the profe&s;&s;ion of their own faith, are oppo&s;ite principles. And Mr. Eli&s;ha Paine &s;aid, "Dear brother, if you can reconcile the above principles, in the e&s;&s;ential parts thereof, you will remove all the grounds of bars and di&s;putes: but if there be an e&s;&s;ential differ|ence in the above articles, and con&s;equently in the practice on them, then there is an Achan in the camp; and no marvel that I&s;rael hath, in all refor|mations, been troubled therewith."

The holy &s;criptures are our rule, and not the be&s;t of men upon earth; yet love to men as Chri&s;tians was then &s;et up by many as the rule of communion, in&s;tead of the written word; and their inward feelings were al&s;o made a rule of di&s;cipline, until &s;ome were cen&s;ured for not concurring there|with. Upon this they renounced mixed commu|nion, and gathered a &s;econd Bapti&s;t church in Sto|nington, and Mr. Simeon Brown was ordained their pa&s;tor in March, 1765. And a pari&s;h mini&s;ter in Stonington &s;aid two years after, "Not le&s;s than two thirds of the congregation, formerly under my care, have withdrawn from my mini&s;try, and formed them|&s;elves into Bapti&s;t and &s;eparate churches."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Preface to Fi&s;h's Nine Sermons, p. 3.</NOTE> And in January, 1769, Mr. Eleazar Brown was ordained in the fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church in that town, which is four miles north of the other. He was born in Stoning|ton, in June, 1728, and was a faithful and &s;ucce&s;sful mini&s;ter, until he died in peace, July 11, 1795. Such a ble&s;&s;ing was granted there in 1792, as cau&s;ed the addition of fifty-&s;ix members to this church; and in 1793 Mr. Peleg Randal was ordained a col|league pa&s;tor in this church, in which he yet contin|ues. And on October 22, 1794, they ordained Mr. Abel Brown as an evangeli&s;t, to go up and labour in the State of New-York. Elder Wait Palmer is yet living, but has not preached much for many years. Elder Simeon Brown was born in Stoning|ton, January 31, 1723, and his u&s;efulne&s;s is &s;till granted, and in the revival of 1792 &s;eventy-&s;ix mem|bers were added to his church. The third Bapti&s;t
<PB N="260" REF="030011_0259_0FE3C1513845B748">church in Stonington was con&s;tituted down at the harbour, April 22, 1775, and Mr. Valentine Wight|man Rathbun was ordained their pa&s;tor in May, 1787. He was born May 13, 1761. Mr. John Rathbun, his father, was ordained there as an evan|geli&s;t, March 15, 1781, and is &s;ettled in A&s;hford. A fourth church was formed in Stonington, and Mr. Samuel Northup, from Narragan&s;et, was ordained their pa&s;tor in 1793, in connexion with the Groton Conference.</P>
<P N="5">V. A &s;eparate church was formed at Lyme, and Mr. Ebenezer Mack was ordained their pa&s;tor, Janu|ary 12, 1749. He and many of the church became Bapti&s;ts afterwards, and he continued with them un|til he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, in September, 1768, and he re|moved to Marlow in New-Hamp&s;hire. And Mr. Ja&s;on Lee was ordained the pa&s;tor of this church, and hath had great &s;ucce&s;s therein, being connected with the Groton Conference. There had been a Bapti&s;t church in the ea&s;t part of Lyme before this, but they were broken and di&s;&s;olved. There was al&s;o a Bapti&s;t church formed in the north part of that town, and Mr. Chri&s;topher Minor was their mini&s;ter for &s;ome years, who is now at Enfield.</P>
<P N="6">VI. A Bapti&s;t church was formed in Colche&s;ter in 1743, and Mr. Zebulun Waterman was their min|i&s;ter for a number of years. After him Mr. Ichabod Allen mini&s;tered to them for a longer time, and who is &s;till living among them; but he hath been rather un&s;teady both in his principles and conduct, which &s;erved to &s;catter the flock. But in May, 1784, a new gathering and union took place among them, and Mr. Abel Palmer became their pa&s;tor, under who&s;e mini&s;try they have enjoyed many ble&s;&s;|ings. Their hou&s;e for wor&s;hip is near the borders of Montville. Another Bapti&s;t church had been formed in Colche&s;ter in 1783, near the borders of Lebanon, and Mr. Chri&s;topher Palmer, father to
<PB N="261" REF="030011_0260_0FE3C1C5F03961F8">Abel, was ordained their pa&s;tor. They came from Stonington. Many ble&s;&s;ings have been granted upon the&s;e churches, and upon people who have &s;prung from them, many of whom have &s;ettled in the wil|derne&s;s, upon the head branches of the Mohawk and Su&s;quehanna rivers, in the State of New-York, where a new A&s;&s;ociation was formed in 1795, of thirteen churches, and more than five hundred mem|bers, which churches had been all formed in five years, as Mr. Abel Palmer &s;ays, who was at &s;aid A&s;|&s;ociation. Tho&s;e people went mainly from New-England, and a large part of them out of the Ston|ington A&s;&s;ociation. There has been a mixed com|munion church in Norwich, in that part which is now Bozrah, for &s;everal years, and Mr. Peter Rogers was their mini&s;ter, who is now at Hampton, but I know not how their &s;tate now is. The mixed com|munion church of Pre&s;ton, have many of their mem|bers in Canterbury, and meetings are often held in both places.</P>

<P N="7">VII. As the great reformation in our land was oppo&s;ed by the ruling party in Thomp&s;on, then a part of Killingly, a &s;eparation took place there, and a Bapti&s;t church was formed in 1750, and Mr. Whitman Jacobs was ordained their pa&s;tor. They held the laying on of hands upon every member as a term of communion, and an A&s;&s;ociation was formed upon tho&s;e principles, which increa&s;ed to about eight churches in 1763; but in two years after the mo&s;t of them gave up that bar of communion, of whom Mr. Jacobs was one, and a council was called at Thomp&s;on in February, 1767, who could not unite the church; and as a number of them removed &s;oon after to Royal&s;ton, their mini&s;ter removed there al&s;o in 1769. The brethren in Thomp&s;on, after many labours, covenanted together anew in Septem|ber,
<PB N="262" REF="030011_0261_0FE3C1566AF96378">and Mr. John Martin was ordained their pa&s;tor, November 3, 1773. He went from Rehoboth, and is &s;till u&s;eful among them.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. Mr. Thomas Denni&s;on was baptized by elder Wightman, of Groton, in the &s;ummer of 1743, and he gathered a &s;mall church at A&s;hford, where he was ordained in November following. Elder Moulton a&s;&s;i&s;ted in his ordination, who derived his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from Mr. John Callender, and he from his uncle Eli&s;ha Callender, in who&s;e ordination three Congregational mini&s;ters of Bo&s;ton a&s;&s;i&s;ted. And this line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is much valued by &s;ome, while all who con&s;i&s;tently hold the Congregational princi|ples, adopted by the fathers of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, hold that the power of ordination is in each church. This church in A&s;hford broke up in a year or two, and Mr. Denni&s;on turned back to infant bapti&s;m, and he a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the ordinations of the fir&s;t &s;eparate mini&s;ters in Mansfield, Canterbury, Plainfield and Norwich; and was in&s;talled him&s;elf as pa&s;tor of a church in that part of Norwich which is now Frank|lin, all in the year 1746. But in a few years he left that people, and preached occa&s;ionally in various parts of the country, without being &s;ettled over any other flock, until he died in Brooklyn, near Canter|bury, October, 24, 1787. A new Bapti&s;t church was formed in A&s;hford in 1774, and Mr. U&s;tick preached to them for a year or two, and then went to Grafton, and Mr. Ebenezer Lam&s;on was ordained their pa&s;tor June 10, 1778. But he removed to Sutton in April, 1783, as was before ob&s;erved; and after &s;everal years, they obtained Mr. Dyer Stark for their mini&s;ter, who hath had con&s;iderable &s;ucce&s;s among them. The &s;econd Bapti&s;t church in A&s;h|ford was formed in the glorious year 1780. Mr. John Rathbun had removed from Stonington, into the north part of A&s;hford before; and after this church was formed, he was ordained at Stonington,
<PB N="263" REF="030011_0262_0FE3C1CB84359360">March 15, 1781, and has been the pa&s;tor of this church ever &s;ince. He was born June 26, 1729. In a revival of religion in the ea&s;t part of A&s;hford, a third church was formed, and Mr. Daniel Bolton was ordained therein, June 27, 1792. He went from Bridgwater. Part of this church live in Pom|fret. About three years after, Mr. Bolton gathered another church near the adjoining corners of A&s;h|ford, Union and Wood&s;tock, and &s;ettled as their mini&s;ter.</P>
<P N="9">IX. The fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church in Wood&s;tock was gathered in the following manner. Biel Ledoyt was a chief leader in mirth and vanity among young peo|ple there, before he heard a Bapti&s;t mini&s;ter preach a &s;ermon in the town, in December, 1763, which was a means of fixing conviction of &s;in in his con&s;cience, and in the March following his &s;oul was brought into go&s;pel liberty; but as &s;oon as his change was heard of abroad, four of his old companions came one evening, to try if they could not draw him back to his former ways again. He readily retired with them to a place where they could be by them&s;elves, and he laid open to them the way of &s;in and death, and the way of life and peace, in &s;uch a manner that two of them went home with a deep &s;en&s;e of &s;in up|on their minds, which terminated happily, and relig|ious meetings were frequent among young people, un|til a large number were hopefully converted. For &s;ome time after this work began, they attended the pari&s;h meetings for wor&s;hip, as they had done before; but &s;uch oppo&s;ition was rai&s;ed again&s;t the work by the Con|gregational party, as convinced tho&s;e young believ|ers that they could not be edified among them; and upon &s;earching the &s;criptures, they were convinced that believers' bapti&s;m was the way that Chri&s;t had in|&s;tituted, and many obeyed him therein, and a Bapti&s;t church was formed in Wood&s;tock in 1766, and Mr. Ledoyt was ordained their pa&s;tor, May 26, 1768, and
<PB N="264" REF="030011_0263_0FE3C15A07D33838">they had forty-eight members in 1773. And though it was a dark time with them through mo&s;t of the war, yet on September 8, 1780, they &s;aid in a letter to the Warren A&s;&s;ociation, "After a long day of de|&s;ertion and heavy trials, our God hath returned to us. By means of the uncommon darkne&s;s in May la&s;t, the Lord was plea&s;ed to awaken &s;ome &s;ouls among us, and from that time the work of God hath been going on gloriou&s;ly in the we&s;t part of this town, where a goodly number are hopefully con|verted, and peace and love abound in the church, and we have had twenty-eight added to us, and there is a pro&s;pect of the &s;preading of the good work in other parts of this town and towns round us. Yet we are much affected with the long confinement of our brethren in Worce&s;ter gaol,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Three men of Harvard Society, before &s;poken of.</NOTE> and cannot but remember them in bounds as being bound with them; nor can we expect to fare better our&s;elves very long; notwith&s;tanding our endeavouring to an&s;wer the un|ju&s;t law of the ruling party, by giving certificates to the members of our &s;ociety, which have been carried to the pari&s;h clerk; yet a con&s;iderable number of them are rated to the &s;tanding mini&s;try, and &s;oon expect to be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed on that account.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Several of them were &s;trained upon for &s;uch taxes.</NOTE> Our oppre&s;&s;ors are deaf to all rea&s;oning upon the &s;ubject, and are de|termined to pro&s;ecute their de&s;ign, let the con&s;e|quence be what it may. The&s;e things, brethren, are peculiarly mortifying to us, e&s;pecially when we con|&s;ider that we have freely fought and bled by their &s;ides in defence of liberty. It appears to us, that if ever there was a time, &s;ince tyranny had exi&s;tence in America, that we were called upon to exert our|&s;elves to obtain what is our own, it is now. Should we let &s;lip this golden &s;ea&s;on, we fear our chains will be &s;o fa&s;t rivetted that we &s;hall not be able to &s;hake them off. We feel but little heart to hold the &s;word
<PB N="265" REF="030011_0264_0FE3C1D04307B608">again&s;t a Briti&s;h invader in defence of liberty, while our countrymen are endeavouring to deprive us of liberty of con&s;cience. Oh, brethren! if we mu&s;t be deprived of this, who would de&s;ire to live and po&s;&s;e&s;s the re&s;t!" Their church increa&s;ed the next year to 140 members. But in 1787 a member of a Congre|gational church obtained a meeting of this Bapti&s;t church, to hear a complaint which he had again&s;t one of their members, without taking the &s;teps pre|&s;cribed by our Lord in Matthew xviii; and it divid|ed, and rai&s;ed &s;uch a fire of contention in this church, as cau&s;ed the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of their pa&s;tor, at his reque&s;t, in March, 1790, and he went into New-Hamp&s;hire, where he is &s;till u&s;eful. Another re|vival was granted in this church in 1792, and Mr. Samuel Web&s;ter was ordained there the 28th of June, who is now at Mon&s;on. A &s;econd Bapti&s;t church was then formed in Wood&s;tock, and Mr. Amos Wells was ordained their pa&s;tor, Augu&s;t 9, 1792, and the Stonington A&s;&s;ociation met there in October, 1795, when it was a good time with them.</P>
<P N="10">X. Mr. Ledoyt was called to preach in the &s;outh part of Pomfret, and a happy number were hopefully converted there, where were al&s;o &s;everal old believ|ers; and they embraced the Bapti&s;t principles, and formed a church there, January 18, and Mr. Will|iam Grow was ordained their pa&s;tor, June 19, 1776, and they pro&s;pered under his mini&s;try for &s;everal years. But in June, 1783, he confe&s;&s;ed that he had fallen into the &s;in of adultery, and re&s;igned his office, and afterwards removed into Vermont. Though this was very &s;hocking, yet the church per&s;evered in their profe&s;&s;ion, and obtained occa&s;ional &s;upplies from time to time, until they called and &s;ettled Mr. Peter Rogers as their pa&s;tor in 1794, who had before been a mini&s;ter in Bozrah. The place where this church meets, with a part of Windham, were lately incorporated into a town by the name of Hampton.
<PB N="266" REF="030011_0265_0FE3C15F44CAE5F0">A Bapti&s;t church was formed in Killingly, May 22, 1776, and Mr. George Robin&s;on was ordained their pa&s;tor the 13th of November following, and they increa&s;ed to 61 members in five years. But there aro&s;e &s;uch difficulties in the church, about the time of the clo&s;e of the war, that they called a council, and then di&s;mi&s;&s;ed and recommended their mini&s;ter, and he removed to Bridgwater in June, 1784, where he is &s;till u&s;eful. They have pa&s;&s;ed through many changes in Killingly &s;ince, without obtaining &s;o hap|py a &s;ettlement as were to be wi&s;hed.</P>
<P N="11">XI. The &s;eparation in Plainfield prevailed &s;o far, that the general &s;cheme of taxing all to Congrega|tional mini&s;ters was given up, and a mini&s;ter was &s;ettled in their town meeting-hou&s;e in 1784, who is &s;upported by &s;ub&s;cription and a public fund, and the &s;eparate meeting was di&s;&s;olved. But in the &s;ummer of 1792, a remarkable awakening took place in the ea&s;t part of the town, and in Stirling, under the min|i&s;try of Mr. Nathanael Cole; and a Bapti&s;t church was formed there, October 16, 1792, and he was in&s;talled their pa&s;tor the 5th of December after, hav|ing been ordained at Swan&s;ea before; and in two years this church increa&s;ed to 87 members. I have not obtained any di&s;tinct account of the pre&s;ent Bap|ti&s;t church in Mansfield, only what Mr. A&s;plund has given in his Regi&s;ter.</P>

<P N="12">XII. The fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church in the country of Hartford was fir&s;t con&s;tituted in Wallingford. A number of people in that town became Bapti&s;ts about 1731, and joined to the Bapti&s;t church in New-Lon|don, but u&s;ually met for wor&s;hip at Wallingford, until they obtained a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, formed a church there, and ordained Mr. John Merriman as their pa&s;tor, in 1739. He was born in Wallingford, October 15, 1695; and as he was a hearty friend
<PB N="267" REF="030011_0266_0FE3C1D5212083B8">to the great work which came on in our land two years after he was ordained, he obtained Dr. Bella|my, and then Mr. Robbins, to preach in his &s;ociety, as they were clear preachers of the go&s;pel. But Mr. Robbins was mo&s;t cruelly per&s;ecuted by his brethren in the mini&s;try, for preaching among the Bapti&s;ts again&s;t their advice, as we have before &s;hewn. Our &s;econd volume, p. 136, 178. In the year 1750, the body of this church removed to the &s;outh part of Farmington, where they &s;till remain. Mr. Merri|man continued their faithful pa&s;tor as long as he was able to labour with them, and he died there in 1784. Afterwards they obtained various helps, un|til they came into the &s;tate that is before de&s;cribed, from the minutes of the Danbury A&s;&s;ociation for 1795. Bri&s;tol is not far from them, where is the church who keep the &s;eventh day as the Sabbath.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. Suffield, on the we&s;t &s;ide of Connecticut-river, had a powerful work among them in 1735, and a greater work &s;ix years after; and when the &s;eparations came on, two &s;eparate churches were formed in the town, and each had an ordained min|i&s;ter. Mr. I&s;rael Holly was one of them, who pub|li&s;hed &s;everal things in favour of their &s;eparate churches, and then again&s;t the Bapti&s;ts, after which he turned back, and became a pari&s;h mini&s;ter. But Mr. John Ha&s;tings, &s;on to their other &s;eparate min|i&s;ter, was called out to preach the go&s;pel, and embrac|ed believers' bapti&s;m; and ju&s;t as the war was com|ing on in our land, &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing was granted upon his labours, that a Bapti&s;t church was formed, and he was ordained their pa&s;tor in 1775, and it increa&s;|ed to above 200 members in about a year. And he has been very u&s;eful, at home and abroad, ever &s;ince.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. Enfield, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river again&s;t Suffield, had al&s;o two &s;eparate churches, in one of which the Bapti&s;t principles were early adopted.
<PB N="268" REF="030011_0267_0FE3C163E87AABC0">Mr. Jo&s;eph Meacham was their mini&s;ter, and they joined to the Warren A&s;&s;ociation in 1769, when they had 30 members; but they afterwards declined from their profe&s;&s;ion, and their mini&s;ter fell in with the Shakers, and is &s;ince dead. The church was broken and &s;cattered for a number of years; but we hear of a late gathering among them, and that they have obtained Mr. Chri&s;topher Minor as their pa&s;tor. He came from Lyme, and was mini&s;ter to the Bap|ti&s;t church in Ea&s;t-Hartford for a number of years, who now have Mr. Stephen Shepard as their min|i&s;ter. A Bapti&s;t church was formed in the city of Hartford in 1789, which increa&s;ed to fifty-three members in two years, and greater ble&s;&s;ings are hop|ed for. A &s;eparate meeting was &s;et up at Wind&s;or, as early as 1747, and Daniel Mar&s;hall went from thence in 1754, and laboured with great &s;ucce&s;s in the &s;outhern States, and began the fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church in Georgia in 1772. His brother, Eliakim Mar&s;hall, was frequently a repre&s;entative for Wind&s;or in Con|necticut legi&s;lature, before his cou&s;in Abraham Mar|&s;hall came there from Georgia, and baptized him, and he was pa&s;tor of a Bapti&s;t church there for four or five years, before he died there in June, 1791. But I know not how things have been in that church &s;ince. There has been a Bapti&s;t meeting in Weth|ersfield for many years, but perhaps not a church formed. The other Bapti&s;t churches in this county appear in the foregoing li&s;t.</P>

<P N="15">XV. After the Bapti&s;t church of Wallingford was removed from thence, their pari&s;h mini&s;ter died, and a divi&s;ion took place in the town, and the con&s;o|ciation of the county a&s;&s;i&s;ted in forming another church, and ordaining a &s;econd mini&s;ter, becau&s;e the majority had got a mini&s;ter from Cambridge, whom they judged to be an Arminian. And as the corpo|ration
<PB N="269" REF="030011_0268_0FE3C1D7DD89E7A8">of Yale college were very zealous again&s;t ad|mitting any into it but &s;trict Calvini&s;ts, long contro|ver&s;ies were carried on in the government about it. And in February, 1783, the controver&s;y was intro|duced into the public papers at Hartford, and it was pur&s;ued therein until June. And to &s;hew how inju|rious the rulers of the college had been to its true intere&s;ts, it was &s;aid, "Mr. Collins, late of Newport, offered eight volumes to the library of Yale college. Being a Bapti&s;t, four of the volumes were in defence of this &s;y&s;tem. The offer of the books was accom|panied with an intimation, that if the eight volumes were received with a good grace, the whole library of the &s;aid Mr. Collins (who was a bachelor) con&s;i&s;t|ing of &s;even or eight hundred volumes, would prob|ably be given to the college. But the condition of giving the eight volumes was not complied with. This condition was, that they &s;hould be placed in the library &s;o that the &s;tudents might &s;ee them, and if they cho&s;e, read them." The writer who gave this information &s;tyled him&s;elf Parna&s;&s;us, to whom an an&s;wer was given by one who &s;ays, "Parna&s;&s;us finds fault that they did not accept of the Anabapti&s;t books upon a &s;hameful condition, which, if they had done it, would have been a ground of objection, that they had iutroduced erroneous books, and have given up the government of the college." Thus it appears, that the corporation of the college were afraid to have any of their &s;cholars read any books again&s;t infant bapti&s;m, le&s;t it &s;hould weaken their plan of orthodoxy; while men who wanted to pull down Calvini&s;m, made u&s;e of this action as a means to do it, though they were far from favouring the Bapti&s;ts. A change in the government of the col|lege took place &s;oon after, and the mini&s;ter who had cau&s;ed a &s;eparation at Wallingford removed and &s;ettled in New-Haven, and two Bapti&s;t churches have &s;ince been formed at Wallingford. And through all
<PB N="270" REF="030011_0269_0FE3C168F2FE3EB8">the country the new Bapti&s;t churches have evidently &s;prung from the &s;piritual work therein, while the towns where that work was rejected remain in their old formality.</P>

<P N="16">XVI. Mr. John Sherwood was born in 1706, converted in 1741, and he with others &s;eparated from the pari&s;h wor&s;hip in Stratfield, becau&s;e a min|i&s;ter was &s;ettled there who did not appear to them to be a go&s;pel preacher. In October, 1751, elder Jo&s;hua Mor&s;e baptized him and a number more, and a Bapti&s;t church was then formed there, and on De|cember 15, 1757, Mr. Sherwood was ordained their pa&s;tor, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of elder Mor&s;e and elder Timothy Wightman. He mini&s;tered to that church about ten years, and then his health failed, and Mr. Benjamin Coles was called from Long-I&s;land to preach to them, in the &s;pring of 1768, and he la|boured with them until the fall of 1774, when he was called into New-Jer&s;ey. Mr. Sherwood was then weak in body, but &s;tedfa&s;t and comfortable in his mind; and how long he lived afterwards I know not. But the church called Mr. Seth Higby from Middletown, and he was ordained their pa&s;tor, and he continued &s;o until 1793, and then he removed to a church in the State of New-York, and elder Ste|phen Royce from New-Hamp&s;hire became their pa&s;tor.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. The Bapti&s;t church in Stamford was form|ed in the following manner. Dr. Jo&s;eph Bellamy publi&s;hed a piece in 1768, to prove that a credible profe&s;&s;ion of &s;aving grace was nece&s;&s;ary, in every per&s;on who came to the Lord's &s;upper, or who was active in bapti&s;m. But Dr. Mo&s;es Mather, of Stam|ford, publi&s;hed a di&s;cour&s;e in April, 1769, wherein he owned that the covenant of circumci&s;ion with Abraham was not the covenant of grace, in the &s;trict
<PB N="271" REF="030011_0270_0FE3C1DDA0530E10">of the word, but held it to be a covenant wherein parents and their children were con&s;tituted members of the vi&s;ible church of God, and that they ought to come to the Lord's &s;upper as a con|verting ordinance, if they were not converted before. Mr. Ebenezer Farris, of Stamford, had newly joined to the fir&s;t church in that town; but the&s;e things gave &s;uch a turn to his mind as cau&s;ed him to &s;earch the &s;criptures afre&s;h, whereby he was fully convinced that bapti&s;m and the holy &s;upper were in&s;tituted only for profe&s;&s;ing believers; and he was baptized by Mr. John Gano, of New-York, in April, 1770, as others were afterwards, until they obtained a regu|lar di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, and al&s;o a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the church in New-York, and formed a Bapti&s;t church at Stam|ford, November 6, 1773, of twenty-one mem|bers. By a like di&s;mi&s;&s;ion and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, a Bapti&s;t church was formed three days before on the bor|ders of Greenwich, called King&s;treet; and Mr. A&s;|plund mi&s;takes in dating the beginning of that church in 1747. Mr. Farris was afterwards ordain|ed the pa&s;tor of the church in Stamford, and al&s;o publi&s;hed a defence of believers' bapti&s;m. Mr. Eb|mezer White, of Danbury, was a hearty friend to the revival of religion in our land; and when he read Sandiman's letters, he manife&s;ted an approba|tion of his ideas concerning the fini&s;hed atonement of Chri&s;t, and &s;o did a majority of his church; but a minor part went and entered a complaint again&s;t Mr. White to their A&s;&s;ociation, upon which he and a large majority of his church, on June 28, 1763, renounced the power that was claimed over the churches on the Saybrook platform. But the min|i&s;ters of that county were &s;o unwilling to part with that power, that they met at Danbury, again&s;t the con&s;ent of Mr. White and the majority of his church, and rejected them as men who had &s;eparated from the eccle&s;ia&s;tical con&s;titution of their government.
<PB N="272" REF="030011_0271_0FE3C16BEB0F5C78">This was on March 27, 1764. Sandiman came into our country the next October, and gathered church|es in &s;everal places; but when he came to Danbury, Mr. White could not agree with him in many things, though a number joined with him there, and al&s;o at New-Haven, and Mr. Sandiman died at Danbury, April 2, 1771, aged 53. But in the en&s;uing war, mo&s;t of his followers held with Britain, and a num|ber of them went off to Nova-Scotia, and their &s;oci|eties are generally di&s;&s;olved. In 1770 Mr. David Jud&s;on, mini&s;ter at Newtown, renounced the Say|brook platform, and publi&s;hed his mind again&s;t it, while the majority of the mini&s;ters exerted all their influence again&s;t him; and two Bapti&s;t churches have been &s;ince gathered in Danbury, and one in Newtown. Ridgfield is al&s;o in this county.</P>
<P><HI>County of Litchfield.</HI></P>
<P N="18">XVIII. There was more of a reformation in this county, in and after 1741, than in many parts of the country. Dr. Bellamy was a very active in&s;trument of that reformation, and his writings afterwards up|on the nature of religion, and al&s;o upon qualifica|tions nece&s;&s;ary for communion in the Chri&s;tian church, &s;cattered much light in our land; and &s;ev|eral other mini&s;ters in the county of Litchfield have been clear preachers of the go&s;pel, and &s;ucce&s;sful in their labours, who now re&s;t therefrom, and others have been introduced in their &s;tead, who are men of another &s;pirit. And &s;ince the late war, nine Bapti&s;t churches have been formed in this county, and &s;even of them in &s;ix years. But as new towns have been con&s;tituted, and old names have been altered, while &s;ome meetings have al&s;o been removed, a little explanation is nece&s;&s;ary. The Bapti&s;t church in Litchfield was the fir&s;t in Watertown, and Roxbury was once called South-Britain, while the names of the other &s;even remain as they were. Some of their
<PB N="273" REF="030011_0272_0FE3C1E2EE554078">mini&s;ters have removed from place to place. Elder Eli&s;ha Ran&s;om was at Watertown in 1790, who be|fore and &s;ince has been at Wood&s;tock, in Vermont. Elder Stephen Shepard was at Torrington in 1790, who is now at Ea&s;t-Hartford. Elder I&s;aac Roots was at Warren in 1790, and at the &s;econd in Wa|tertown in 1793, but at no church in that A&s;&s;ocia|tion in 1795. Elder Nathaniel Norton was at Dan|bury in 1790, and at Wallingford in 1791, but out of that A&s;&s;ociation &s;ince. In new churches, and in changes of &s;entiments, men are often more un&s;teady than when they obtain more clear e&s;tabli&s;hment. Though travelling mini&s;ters, if they are wi&s;e and faithful, have done much good in every age; while deceitful teachers, whether &s;upported by law, or travelling through the world, have done infinite evils to mankind.</P>
<P><HI>County of Middle&s;ex.</HI></P>
<P N="19">XIX. There were &s;ome Bapti&s;ts in Saybrook as early as 1729, who then complied with the certifi|cate law, to exempt them from taxes to e&s;tabli&s;hed mini&s;ters, as Dr. Stiles informed me. In January, 1744, elder Timothy Peckom vi&s;ited them, and bap|tized &s;ome per&s;ons on a Lord's day, when the water of a brook was rai&s;ed for the purpo&s;e. For the&s;e things he and a number more were impri&s;oned at New-London, one of whom was a woman with a child at her brea&s;t. Mr. Elnathan Wilcox was a mini&s;ter in the church there for a number of years before 1770, but in 1780 he was &s;ettled at Stock|bridge. Elder Le&s;ter, from New-London, was &s;et|tled at Saybrook afterwards, and remains there. But in 1788 a number drew off and formed another church, and ordained Mr. William Hill as their pa&s;|tor, and they are connected with the Groton Con|ference. The other Bapti&s;t churches in this county belong to the Stonington A&s;&s;ociation, and their &s;tate
<PB N="274" REF="030011_0273_0FE3C1717B6FD5E8">has been given from their minutes. Abraham Doo|little, of Middletown, went to the &s;eparate meeting there for &s;ome years, to hear Mr. Ebenezer Froth|ingham preach, who was fir&s;t ordained at Wethers|field, October 28, 1747, but removed his meeting to Middletown a few years after. But as Mr. Doo|little embraced the Bapti&s;t &s;entiments, Frothingham openly and frequently prayed and preached again&s;t them, and then publi&s;hed a bitter pamphlet upon the &s;ubject; therefore Doolittle and his friends with|drew and &s;et up a meeting by them&s;elves in 1769, and Mr. Seth Higby, who married his daughter, be|gan to preach there, who went afterwards to Strat|field, as was before related. Doolittle is a member of a Bapti&s;t church in Wallingford. But about the year 1781, Mr. Frothingham was rejected by his church, and they ordained Mr. Stephen Par&s;ons in his &s;tead, who was well e&s;teemed in his place, until he was con&s;trained to give up infant bapti&s;m, and was baptized, with about fifteen of his church, in the clo&s;e of the &s;ummer of 1795; &s;o that a Bapti&s;t church is like to be &s;ettled there &s;oon.</P>
<P><HI>County of Tolland.</HI></P>
<P N="20">XX. A Bapti&s;t church was formed in Tolland, and Mr. Shubael Stearns was ordained therein March 20, 1751, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the elders Wait Palmer and Jo&s;hua Mor&s;e. But in July, 1754, Stearns baptized Mr. Noah Alden, of Staf|ford, and he &s;et off the next month, with oth|ers, to go into our &s;outhern governments. And Stearns wrote to Alden, from Hamp&s;hire county, in Virginia, June 13, 1755, and informed him that &s;ome of their company were then &s;ettled in North-Carolina, who &s;aid to him in a letter, "That there was no e&s;tabli&s;hed meeting within an hundred miles of them, and that the people were &s;o eager to hear, that they often came forty miles each way, when they
<PB N="275" REF="030011_0274_0FE3C1E7D0EA2B70">could have an opportunity to hear a &s;ermon." He went him&s;elf, and gathered a Bapti&s;t church on San|dy-Creek, Orange county, North-Carolina. When I was in Virginia in 1789, I &s;aw a record of the be|ginning of their A&s;&s;ociations, and was informed that Daniel Mar&s;hall baptized Samuel Harris, who had been a member of their legi&s;lature, and a judge of court in Virginia. Their fir&s;t A&s;&s;ociation met in January, 1760, and they met again in July that year, when the li&s;t of their churches &s;tood thus, including both meetings. Sandy-Creek, elder Shubael Stearns; Deep-river, Nathaniel Powel, a brother; Abbot's|creek, elder Daniel Mar&s;hall; Little-river, Jo&s;eph Breed, a brother; Neus-river, Ezekiel Hunter; Black-river, John Newton; Dan-river, Pitt&s;ylvania county, elder Samuel Harris; Lunenburg county, William Murphey. The two la&s;t are in Virginia, the re&s;t are in North-Carolina. Elder Stearns wrote again to elder Alden, from Sandy-Creek, October 16, 1765, and &s;aid, "The Lord carries on his work glori|ou&s;ly in &s;undry places in this province, and in Virgin|ia, and South-Carolina." And he laboured in tho&s;e parts as long as he lived; but Mar&s;hall went and gathered the fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church in Georgia, where|of his &s;on, Abraham Mar&s;hall, is pa&s;tor. And it appears by the minutes of their A&s;&s;ociation in 1792, that they had fifty-&s;ix churches, and 3796 members in the State of Georgia. How wonderful are the&s;e events! They who were left of the church in Tol|land, joined with others in Stafford, and ordained Mr. Alden as their pa&s;tor, June 5, 1755, and he la|boured with them ten years, and then &s;uch di&s;orders had crept into the church, that he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by the advice of a council, as was before ob&s;erved. They have pa&s;&s;ed through various changes &s;ince, and their pre&s;ent &s;tate is given above. A &s;eparate church was formed in Somers about 1751, and Mr. Jo&s;eph Mar&s;hall was ordained their pa&s;tor, who &s;oon became
<PB N="276" REF="030011_0275_0FE3C0374D955350">a Bapti&s;t, and then turned back to infant bapti&s;m, and he was in&s;talled at Canterbury, &s;ucce&s;&s;or to Mr. Paine; but after a few years he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and has preached about the country ever &s;ince, without taking the charge of any other flock. But we are informed that a Bapti&s;t church was con&s;tituted in Somers in 1790, and that Mr. Seth Par&s;ons is &s;ince ordained their pa&s;tor. Mr. Lillebridge, the pa&s;tor of the Bapti&s;t church in Willington, came from the State of Rhode-I&s;land, and is e&s;teemed in his place. But I have no further accounts of that church, nor of the other Bapti&s;ts in the county of Tolland, that appear to be &s;erviceable to the public, than what are already given.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">1. ALL the lands between Merrimack and Pi&s;cat|aqua rivers, and &s;ixty miles into the country, were granted to captain John Ma&s;on, in 1629, under the name of New-Hamp&s;hire. But the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts charter extended three miles north of Merrimack-river, and Ma&s;on, with his heirs or a&s;&s;igns, claimed all the re&s;t of tho&s;e lands; and this was the cau&s;e why New-Hamp&s;hire was not included in the &s;econd charter to the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, in 1691, as Gorges' grant was, which this government had purcha&s;ed of his heirs. None of the lands within this grant, nor from thence to Connecticut-river, were ever the free property of the people, &s;o as to be granted by their repre&s;entatives, before the late American war; and quit-rents were re&s;erved upon the lands which were granted by their governors, until the American rev|olution put an end to them. Dr. Belknap has given a clear view of the&s;e things, in his elegant Hi&s;tory of New-Hamp&s;hire. And as the governors and coun|&s;ellors of that government were appointed by the crown, the Congregational denomination were never exalted &s;o high above all others there, as they have
<PB N="278" REF="030011_0277_0FE3C1761883A280">been in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and Connecticut; and &s;ince the revolution, if the majority of any town elect a Bapti&s;t teacher for their mini&s;ter, he may have the privilege of the lands therein which were granted for the mini&s;try, and al&s;o may be &s;upported by tax if he will. And the Bapti&s;ts increa&s;ed &s;o much in the year 1780, that a mini&s;ter of Rowley publi&s;hed a letter again&s;t them, in a Bo&s;ton paper of February 8, 1781, in which he &s;aid, "Alas, the con&s;equence of the prevalence of this &s;ect! They cau&s;e divi&s;ions every where. In the State of New-Hamp&s;hire, where there are many new towns, infant &s;ettlements, if this &s;ect gets footing among them, they hinder, and are like to hinder, their &s;ettling and &s;upporting learned, pious and orthodox mini&s;ters; and &s;o the poor inhabitants of tho&s;e towns mu&s;t live, who knows how long? without the mini&s;try of the go&s;pel, and go&s;pel ordinances." As if the go&s;pel, and go&s;pel ordinances, were confined to the Congregational party. Yea, he &s;aid to the Bapti&s;ts, "You have had two grand conventions (the &s;econd of them upon adjournment) within a few months pa&s;t, at a town in the State of New-Hamp&s;hire, to &s;erve and pro|mote this cau&s;e; at which conventions, the&s;e illiter|ate and un&s;kilful preachers, and delegates from your little churches around, were members. And one thing I heard of as a part of your bu&s;ine&s;s at &s;aid convention, was to con&s;ult what mea&s;ures you &s;hould take to make void in part our new con&s;titution of government; that part of it which re&s;pects the public wor&s;hip of God." But all the pretence he could have for this repre&s;entation, was becau&s;e the Warren A&s;&s;ociation met in September, 1780, at Royal&s;tone, which adjoins to New-Hamp&s;hire, and after it was over, the church there agreed to call a council the next month, for advice upon &s;ome difficulties among them&s;elves, and not upon the concerns of the gov|ernment. Though as three men of the Harvard
<PB N="279" REF="030011_0278_0FE3C1EB7B175990">&s;ociety had been impri&s;oned at Worce&s;ter, and oth|ers were daily expo&s;ed to the &s;ame &s;ufferings, for taxes to Congregational mini&s;ters, the Warren A&s;&s;o|ciation drew up a te&s;timony again&s;t &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ion, in their &s;aid meeting, and printed many copies of it, which were &s;ent into all parts of the government, and was &s;igned by many hundreds of men, of various denominations. And is it a crime for any men who are oppre&s;&s;ed, to expo&s;e the iniquity of their oppre&s;|&s;ors, and openly to te&s;tify again&s;t the &s;ame?</P>
<P N="2">II. The fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church that was formed in New-Hamp&s;hire, was at Newtown, northward of Haverhill, in 1755. In June that year Mr. Walter Powers was ordained their pa&s;tor, and they increa&s;ed under his mini&s;try for &s;ome years; but then differ|ent &s;entiments about church di&s;cipline, with unhap|py tempers in controver&s;ies, cau&s;ed &s;uch difficulties, that a council of four churches was called, May 18, 1761, and held four days, without being able to rec|oncile pa&s;tor and people. And he was afterwards di&s;mi&s;&s;ed and removed away, and is &s;ince dead; but his &s;on is a u&s;eful mini&s;ter at Gilmantown. This church at Newtown laboured through many difficul|ties, until a Bapti&s;t church was formed in Haverhill, in 1765, and then many of the members joined there, and this church was di&s;&s;olved. But the main body of the inhabitants of Newtown, have lately come &s;o much into the Bapti&s;t &s;entiments, that they prevailed with Mr. John Peak, who had been preach|ing at Cambridge and Woburn, to remove there in the fall of 1795, and a Bapti&s;t church was formed here in February, 1796. He was born at Walpole, in this State, September 26, 1761, was ordained at Wind&s;or, in Vermont, and hath been a &s;ucce&s;sful preacher in various parts of the country.</P>
<P N="3">III. The revival of religion in 1764, &s;pread into &s;everal towns in New-Hamp&s;hire, and the doctrine of believers' bapti&s;m followed it, until Mr. Smith, of
<PB N="280" REF="030011_0279_0FE3C17AFB09B948">Haverhill, was &s;ent for, and he baptized thirty-eight per&s;ons in a week, in June, 1770. Fourteen of them were the Congregational mini&s;ter and majority of his church in Deerfield, who were &s;ettled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Bapti&s;t church the &s;ame month. Mr. Eliphalet Smith was their pa&s;tor, who is now at Fayette, in the county of Lincoln, before &s;poken of. A Bapti&s;t church was formed at Stratham, July 18, 1770, of fourteen members, and another at Brentwood of thirteen members, May 2, 1771, and one of &s;ixteen members was con&s;tituted at Nottingham the next day; and the&s;e churches unitedly called Mr. Samuel Shepard to receive ordination, and he was ordained at Stratham, September 25, 1771, when Dr. Still|man preached the &s;ermon, Mr. Smith, of Haverhill, gave the charge, and Dr. Manning, of Providence, the right hand of fellow&s;hip. Mr. Shepard was born at Sali&s;bury, near Newbury, in 1739, was early changed by grace, and was a u&s;eful phy&s;ician, before he was baptized in June, and began to preach in July, 1770. The&s;e three churches have united as one, and others have joined with them from other places, &s;o that they had one hundred and &s;ixty-one members in 1785; and though they did not increa&s;e for five years after, yet &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing was then grant|ed that they had three hundred and ninety-&s;even members in 1792, and five hundred and twenty-&s;ix in 1793. And one hundred and twenty-one were di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed the next year, though they have a large num|ber now. Mr. Jo&s;hua Smith was of this church, who laboured much in various places, with con&s;id|erable &s;ucce&s;s, until he died with a con&s;umption in February, 1795. Elder Samuel Currier was al&s;o of this church, who is now ordained at Wentworth. Elder Shepard has travelled and laboured much in our new towns, e&s;pecially in 1780. Our &s;econd volume, p. 390. And he has &s;ince publi&s;hed &s;ev|eral books in defence of our &s;entiments.</P>

IV. A Bapti&s;t church was formed at Salem, in this county, in 1780, and Mr. Samuel Fletcher was ordained their pa&s;tor, December 6, 1781. He was born in the couty of Middle&s;ex, in Augu&s;t, 1747, born again in 1767, and began to preach in 1777. He was called to preach at Chelmsford in the &s;pring of 1770, and preached there the main of the time for two years, and his labours were al&s;o very &s;uc|ce&s;sful in &s;everal other places, which appeared to be the cau&s;e of his meeting with uncommon abu&s;e in one place. For being called to Pepperell, in com|pany with Dr. Parker, of Harvard, they met by the &s;ide of a river, for the conveniency of baptizing within an inclo&s;ed field; but while Mr. Fletcher was preaching, a large mob broke into the field, and interrupted him in his &s;ermon, while a dog was car|ried and plunged in the river, in evident contempt of our mode of bapti&s;m. The chief officers of the town were leaders of the mob; therefore a gentle|man invited the&s;e mini&s;ters to go and hold their meeting at his hou&s;e, near another river, and they did &s;o, and Fletcher went through with his &s;ermon, after which two dogs more were dipped in that river, and one young man al&s;o dipped his compan|ion, in a mo&s;t &s;cornful manner, and &s;ome officers of the town advi&s;ed &s;aid mini&s;ters to depart immedi|ately out of town for their own &s;afety. But they privately agreed with their friends to di&s;per&s;e, and they met at another place of water, and baptized &s;ix per&s;ons near night, though further abu&s;e was offered them afterwards. Our &s;econd volume, p. 323. Elder Fletcher continued a faithful pa&s;tor of this church, until he was taken away by death in March, 1795, when his corps was carried to the Congregational meeting-hou&s;e in Salem, where a Bapti&s;t mini&s;ter preached a funeral &s;ermon for him, and then &s;ev|eral Congregational mini&s;ters were his pall-bearers, with others of his own denomination.</P>

V. The Bapti&s;t church in Northwood was al&s;o formed in 1780, and Mr. Edmund Pil&s;bury was or|dained their pa&s;tor, who had been a member of Ha|verhill church. They had forty-four members in 1785, but had no increa&s;e for five years after, and then &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing was granted that &s;eventy mem|bers were added in two years, and they appear to be in harmony. But after two churches were form|ed, in two parts of Canterbury in this county, in 1779 and 1780, &s;ome corrupt teachers drew away a number of them, and tho&s;e churches, as well as one in Chiche&s;ter, are not among our a&s;&s;ociated churches, if they are not entirely &s;cattered and di&s;|&s;olved. For although pari&s;hes that are formed and &s;upported by the civil magi&s;trate, will continue as long as that power can uphold them, yet churches that are formed by the laws of Chri&s;t, are removed out of their places if they leave their fir&s;t love, and refu&s;e to repent.

<P N="6">VI. The Bapti&s;t church in Gilmantown was formed in 1772, and Mr. Walter Powers was or|dained their pa&s;tor about four years after. In 1789 they had thirty members, in 1792 they had forty-four, and in three years they increa&s;ed to &s;eventy-&s;ix. The church in Meredith was formed in 1780, when forty-three per&s;ons were baptized in one day by elder Shepard. Mr. Nicholas Fol&s;om was or|dained their pa&s;tor in 1782, who went from Brent|wood, and continues in that office. Their A&s;&s;ocia|tion began in 1789. The church in Sandburnton was al&s;o formed in 1780, and Mr. John Crocket was ordained their pa&s;tor September 3, 1794. The church in Sandwich was formed in 1793, and Mr. Jacob Jewel is their pa&s;tor. Madbury contains a part of Berwick church, and we have no late account of any other Bapti&s;t church in this county.</P>

VII. A Bapti&s;t church was formed at Weare, and they joined with the Warren A&s;&s;ociation in 1768, when Mr. Pelatiah Tingley was their me&s;&s;enger. In 1770 they had &s;ixteen members, but &s;uch unhappy controver&s;ies aro&s;e among them, that they &s;ent no more to the A&s;&s;ociation, and they were left out of it in 1774. But they were revived again in 1783, and Mr. Amos Wood, who graduated at Rhode-I&s;land college in 1786, was ordained their pa&s;tor, and has continued &s;o ever &s;ince. The town of Hop|kinton is not far from Weare, and &s;uch a work took place there, under the preaching of Mr. Smith, of Haverhill, and others, that they had &s;eventeen baptiz|ed per&s;ons among them in 1769, and they joined as a branch of Haverhill church, until they were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed and formed a church in Hopkinton in May, 1771. But fal&s;e teachers and corrupt principles prevailed &s;o much among them afterwards, as to di&s;&s;olve their church. Though elder Seamans, in a letter to a friend in 1794, gave the following account of a re|vival among them. "Soon after I came into this wilderne&s;s (&s;aid he) I found that the Bapti&s;t intere&s;t was much &s;maller than I expected. In Hopkinton, there had been a Bapti&s;t church, but not one &s;tone of that building was left upon another. I preached &s;ome there, and baptized three per&s;ons; and after a conference or two with them, they came into church &s;tate, adopted our articles of faith, and I admini&s;|tered the communion to them, which they had not had for a number of years. The reformation began there in the &s;ummer of 1792, and now there is a church there, with its two branches in Bow and Goffstown, of one hundred and thirteen members; a very re&s;pectable body of Chri&s;tians." This was their &s;tate in 1794, and they have &s;ince obtained elder Eli&s;ha Andrews to be their pa&s;tor. There had been &s;ome Bapti&s;ts in Temple for &s;eventeen years,
<PB N="284" REF="030011_0283_0FE3C18521E5FE68">even from the beginning of that plantation, until they formed a church there, Augut 21, 1782, of twenty-two members. Another had been formed the April before in Perry&s;ton, now Sutton, and Mr. Samuel Ambro&s;e was ordained their pa&s;tor in Sep|tember after. The church in Ma&s;on, formed in 1786, obtained Mr. William Elliot for their mini&s;|ter, but we are informed that he labours part of his time at Hollis, where a Bapti&s;t church was formed in 1791.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. We have more particular account of two other churches in this in this county. The fir&s;t is at New-London, where elder Seamans removed from Attle|borough in 1788. As he was the fir&s;t mini&s;ter of the town, they gave him the lands which were granted for the mini&s;try therein, and al&s;o &s;upported him by a tax. A Bapti&s;t church was formed there in 1788, and he &s;ettled as their pa&s;tor, but they had very little increa&s;e for four years; and he had many fears that he took a wrong &s;tep in removing from Attleborough, although he then thought he had good rea&s;ons for it. The&s;e fears were very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to his mind, until a ble&s;&s;ing was granted upon his min|i&s;try in 1792, which appeared the mo&s;t vi&s;ible in and after Augu&s;t in that year. In a letter to a friend, of Jannuary 29, 1793, he &s;aid, "This town con&s;i&s;ts of about fifty families, and I hope that between forty and fifty &s;ouls have been tran&s;lated out of darkne&s;s into God's marvellous light, in this town, be&s;ides a number in Sutton and Fi&s;herfield, who congregate with us. Fifteen have been baptized, and joined to the church, and I expect that a number more will come forward in a &s;hort time. Indeed I know not of one of them but what is likely to &s;ubmit to go&s;ped order, nor one per&s;on in the town who &s;tands in any con&s;iderable oppo&s;ition. We have lectures or con|ferences almo&s;t every day or evening in the week. Our very children meet together to conver&s;e and
<PB N="285" REF="030011_0284_0FE3C053F22C3918">pray with each other; and I believe I may &s;afely &s;ay, that our young people were never a quarter &s;o much engaged in frolicking, as they now are in the great concerns of the &s;oul and eternity. Some things in this work have exceeded any thing I ever &s;aw before. Their convictions have u&s;ually been very clear and powerful, &s;o that indu&s;trious men and women have had neither inclination nor &s;trength to follow their bu&s;ine&s;s as u&s;ual. And they freely acknowledge the ju&s;tice and &s;overeignty of God. They al&s;o have de|&s;ires beyond what I have ever before known, for the univer&s;al out-pouring of the Holy Spirit." And in another letter, December 1, 1794, directed to an|other friend, he &s;aid, "The work began here in 1792; our church them con&s;i&s;ted of eighteen mem|bers, and now we have one hundred and fifteen, all except three or four within five miles of our meet|ing-hou&s;e, Some of all ages from &s;eventy down to eight years old have joined to the church. I think we have thirty-&s;even men with their wives in the church." The town of Sali&s;bury, upon the great road from Bo&s;ton to Dartmouth college, is not far from him; and a number of men in that town were of the Bapti&s;t &s;entiments, and built a good meeting-hou&s;e there, when there was hardly a baptized per|&s;on among them. Elder Seamans was called to preach among them in 1792, and he &s;ays in &s;aid let|ter, "A number wanted to have a Bapti&s;t church con&s;titued, as they intended to have a Bapti&s;t min|i&s;ter. But I told them that there mu&s;t be &s;omething done among&s;t them which man could not do, before a Bapti&s;t church could be gathered there. And this work the Lord begun about the &s;ame time as at Hopkinton, and now there is a flouri&s;hing church there of one hundred and twenty-five members, with a fine preacher." Mr. Elias Smith, who came from Connecticut, and preached in many places, and was ordained as a travelling mini&s;ter, is &s;ettled as their pa&s;tor.</P>

<P N="9">IX. A Bapti&s;t church was formed in Richmond, and Mr. Matturean Bollou was ordained their pa&s;|tor, September 27, 1770, being the fir&s;t mini&s;ter of any denomination in the town. They joined to the Warren A&s;&s;ociation in 1771, when they informed the A&s;&s;ociation, that a number of the inhabitants were unwilling to allow their mini&s;ter the privileges of the fir&s;t mini&s;ter of the town, and that neighbour|ing towns would not regard the certificates which they gave to &s;ome of their &s;ociety who lived therein. Their church had then twenty-nine members, and they increa&s;ed to &s;eventy-nine in three years; and then they were in a low condition for &s;ix years after, until the revival in 1780 cau&s;e the addition of for|ty-four in three years more. In the mean time a divi&s;ion took place among them, and another church was formed, in which Mr. Artemas Aldrich was or|dained. And they were in broken circum&s;tances, until another revival began in 1790, which cau&s;ed the addition of one hundred and &s;ix members in about two years, and their two min&s;ters were di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed, and the two churches united, with Mr. I&s;aac Kenny for their pa&s;tor. In 1794 they were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed to the Leyden A&s;&s;ociation.</P>
<P N="10">X. Many of the inhabitants of We&s;tmoreland went from the fir&s;t Bapti&s;t &s;ociety in Middleborough, and they formed a Bapti&s;t church there in 1771, and Mr. Ebenezer Bayley was ordained their pa&s;tor, November 30, 1773. But after &s;ome years a divi&s;|ion took place among them, and another church was formed, in which Mr. Nathaniel Wilbore preach|es, though he is not ordained. Another church was formed in Marlow in 1777, and Mr. Eleazar Beck|with was ordained their pa&s;tor, and &s;o continues. He and many of his people went from Lyme, in Connecticut. Mr. Caleb Blood was ordained there|in
<PB N="287" REF="030011_0286_0FE3BB12D3C93368">in October, 1777, who is now at Shaft&s;bury. When this church joined to the Wood&s;tock A&s;&s;oci|ation in 1786, they had one hundred and eighteen members, and in 1790 they had one hundred and eighty-four. A Bapti&s;t church was formed at Croy|den in 1778, and in 1790 they joined with Newport, and &s;ettled elder Bial Ledoyt as their pa&s;tor, who went from Wood&s;tock in Connecticut. And a revival of religion began among them in June, 1793, by means of an alarming providence. For the elde&s;t &s;on of Mr. Seamans, a lovely youth, came to a&s;&s;i&s;t in rai&s;ing the frame of a meeting-hou&s;e at Newport, but he fell from the top of it, and died &s;oon. The afflic|tion was exceeding great to his parents, and very alarming to others, which the Spirit of God made u&s;e of for their good. And on September 16, 1793, Mr. Ledoyt &s;aid in a letter to a friend, "It hath been a long, dark, and cloudy night with me, and the people here; but glory to our God, the cloud is di&s;per&s;ing fa&s;t. His work is begun among us; Newport and Croyden are greatly ble&s;&s;ed. There have been forty &s;ouls hopefully converted in a few weeks among us, I have baptized twenty-nine in four weeks. The work appears &s;till going on. I cannot be idle, it is out of my power to an&s;wer all the calls I have at this time; but I endeavour to do all I can. Being favoured with health, and the &s;pirit of preach|ing, I a&s;cend the mountains ea&s;y. There is a pro&s;|pect of a glorious reformation in the&s;e parts. O may it &s;pread far and wide! God hath remembered my family al&s;o for good; my three elde&s;t daughters, I hope, are converted; the olde&s;t &s;eventeen years, and the younge&s;t ten years old, are baptized. O bless the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together. I never more &s;en&s;ibly needed wi&s;dom than at pre&s;ent. You will not cea&s;e to pray for me. O dear brother, be &s;trong in the Lord, and in the power of his
<PB N="288" REF="030011_0287_0FE3C18E8E6833B0">might." I mu&s;t leave the re&s;t of the churches in this county, as they appear in the foregoing li&s;t.</P>

<P N="11">XI. The fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church in this county, was formed at Lebanon, in June, 1771, and Mr. Jedidiah Hebbard was ordained therein in 1784. But &s;o ma|ny of them removed to other places, that in 1790 they concluded that the church was di&s;&s;olved. El|der Hebbard has &s;ince been pa&s;tor of the church in Corni&s;h. A Bapti&s;t church was formed in Canaan in 1783, wherein elder Baldwin was ordained, and he mini&s;tered to them until he removed to Bo&s;ton in 1790. Many of the inhabitants of Grafton went from Rehoboth and Swan&s;ea, and they formed a Bapti&s;t church there in 1785, and Mr. Oliver Will|iams was ordained their pa&s;tor, and continued &s;o until he died in a joyful manner, Augu&s;t 15, 1790, aged 39. He went from the State of Rhode-I&s;land, and probably was one of the po&s;terity of Mr. Roger Williams, the founder of that State. The church in Rumney was formed in 1780, and Mr. Cotton Hains was ordained their pa&s;tor in Augu&s;t that year. The church in Holderne&s;s was formed the &s;ame year, and Mr. Jeremiah Ward is their pa&s;tor. The re&s;t of the Bapti&s;t churches in this county appear in the foregoing li&s;t, of whom I have not received &s;o full accounts as I expected. But I have &s;ome things of a more exten&s;ive nature, concerning this part of the country, which may be beneficial to the public.</P>
<P N="12">XII. Dr. Eleazar Wheelock was &s;ettled in the min|i&s;try, in the we&s;t part of Lebanon, in Connecticut, and was acquainted with experimental religion before Mr. Whitefield came into our country; and he was an ac|tive and &s;ucce&s;sful labourer in the reformation that followed, until the work was much abated, and then he turned his attention to the in&s;truction of the In|dians, in order to &s;pread the go&s;pel among them;
<PB N="289" REF="030011_0288_0FE3C1FF97374C60">which led on to the forming Dartmouth college, which was e&s;tabli&s;hed in Hanover, in this county, to which he removed in the &s;ummer of 1770. Some revival of religion was granted in this wilderne&s;s &s;oon after, and things looked encouraging, until war broke out in our land, which tried the hearts of all. And as a quantity of money for this college had been collected in England and Scotland, which was put into a fund in London, from whence the inter|e&s;t was to be drawn annually, &s;ome imagined that Dr. Wheelock was bia&s;&s;ed in favour of Britain in the war, which occa&s;ioned the following actions. He lived &s;o remote from the &s;eat of their govern|ment, that proclamations for fa&s;ts and thank&s;givings &s;ometimes failed of reaching him until the days ap|pointed were pa&s;t; and as Connecticut government had appointed November 16, 1775, for their annual thank&s;giving, of which he had received an account, he and his people kept that day. But in the week following he received a proclamation from the au|thority of his own government, which appointed another day a fortnight after the other; and he was willing that all who had not kept the former day &s;hould keep the latter, while he could not in con|&s;cience keep two thank&s;givings in that &s;ea&s;on, only to obey the commandments of men. Yet becau&s;e he refu&s;ed to do it, he was threatened to be pro&s;e|cuted by authority, therefore he preached a &s;ermon on &s;aid day, from John xviii. 36, and publi&s;hed it to the world, under the title of <HI>Liberty of Con&s;cience; or, No King but Chri&s;t in his Church.</HI> He ob&s;erved that rulers have only power to propo&s;e the keep|ing of &s;uch days, and to protect all in their wor&s;hip from being injured by others, while the con&s;ent of the people to keep the day, is the only thing that can make it binding upon them to do it. And he &s;ays, "When civil power encroaches an inch upon Chri&s;t's prerogative, a &s;anctified and enlightened
<PB N="290" REF="030011_0289_0FE3C1947096A110">con&s;cience can never be compelled to a compliance; and if they are of the truth, and hear Chri&s;t's voice, no in&s;truments of cruelty will avail any thing in this attempt.&mdash;The lea&s;t yielding in this ca&s;e is danger|ous, and a direct and leading &s;tep to a flood of per|&s;ecution, however remote it may &s;eem at pre&s;ent."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">n. p. 26.</NOTE> Yea, and &s;upporting religious teachers by compul|&s;ion hath been a greater &s;ource of per&s;ecution, than a compelling of people to keep days of fa&s;ting or thank&s;giving ever was. Of this Mr. Eden Bur|roughs, pa&s;tor of the church in Hanover, became &s;o &s;en&s;ible that he gave up the practice. He had been a mini&s;ter in Connecticut, and he was &s;o much af|fected with a view of the corruption of their church|es, that he publi&s;hed a di&s;cour&s;e in 1784 from tho&s;e words, <HI>Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I &s;ay?</HI> And he plainly &s;hews that the con|duct of men, be it in obedience to the laws of Chri&s;t, or in conformity to the world, is the language which &s;peaks the loude&s;t in all rational minds, and much more to the Son of God. And he &s;ays, "If the confidence of profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians one towards an|other is not founded upon a mutual apprehen&s;ion that each other is governed by a &s;acred regard to what Chri&s;t has &s;aid and enjoined in his word, there is no Chri&s;tian confidence, and con&s;equently no Chri&s;|tian charity among&s;t them&mdash;And it is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible for profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians to have <HI>this</HI> mu|tual confidence towards each other, while they &s;ee that they are &s;o commonly di&s;po&s;ed to bite and de|vour one another, by &s;eeking to get the advantage of each other, in their commerce and dealings; or to &s;tander, backbite, and reproach one another; or to be unfaithful in fulfilling their promi&s;es and en|gagements to each other; or to be in&s;en&s;ible of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lre&s;&s;es of each other." Again he &s;ays,
<PB N="291" REF="030011_0290_0FE3C204B5EC7D38">"There is nothing that can have &s;uch a tendency to prejudice the minds and harden the hearts of men again&s;t the truth, as on the one hand to hold it up to view as being of the mo&s;t &s;acred and weighty im|portance, and on the other hand to trifle with it in our daily practice. And this one ob&s;ervation is &s;uf|ficient to account for that flood of dei&s;m and infi|delity that &s;o awfully threatens to deluge the land. It is in vain for profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians to call upon mankind to believe that which it is evident, by their daily practice, they do not believe them&s;elves.&mdash; Tho&s;e corporations who call them&s;elves churches of Chri&s;t, whil&s;t they refu&s;e to put the laws of his king|dom into execution, and will &s;uffer them to be tram|pled under foot, are more awfully guilty of the blood of &s;ouls than every other &s;et of men under heaven."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Borroughs on the Laws of Chri&s;t, p. 14, 67, 68.</NOTE> The&s;e things cau&s;ed many controver&s;ies among their churches, as well as moved many to withdraw from them. And we are informed that elder Seamans hath found it to be &s;uch a bondage to be &s;upported by tax and compul&s;ion, that he hath lately renounced that practice.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. A foundation doctrine of Chri&s;tianity was al&s;o openly &s;truck again&s;t in this part of our country, even the atonement of Chri&s;t. For a mini&s;ter of Newport publi&s;hed three &s;ermons in 1786, to prove that all the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t were from wicked men and devils, and that God never inflicted any puni&s;hment at all upon him for the &s;ins of men; but that the whole of the atonement of Chri&s;t was his good teaching and good example in life and death. His fir&s;t argument for this opinion is this, "Nothing could merit favour for &s;inners, which was not in it&s;elf agreeable to the divine mind." And having proved that God has no plea&s;ure in the death of &s;inners, he &s;ays, "Rea&s;on forbids the conclu&s;ion, that he &s;hould have any plea&s;ure in the &s;ufferings of
<PB N="292" REF="030011_0291_0FE3C199539BDA08">his dutiful and well beloved Son."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> on Atonement, p. 19.</NOTE> But we ought to know, that the favour and love of God never could be purcha&s;ed; for it was his love that cau&s;ed him to give his Son to &s;uffer the cur&s;e of the law, that God might be ju&s;t, and the ju&s;tifier of him who believeth in Je&s;us. Where is boa&s;ting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay, but by the law of faith. Rom. iii. 24&mdash;27. And if men deny that God could have any plea&s;ure in the death of his Son, yet he &s;ays, It plea&s;ed the Lord to brui&s;e him, he hath put him to grief: when thou &s;halt make his &s;oul an offering for &s;in, he &s;hall &s;ee his &s;eed, he &s;hall prolong his days, and the plea&s;ure of the Lord &s;hall pro&s;per in his hand. He &s;hall &s;ee of the travail of his &s;oul, and &s;hall be &s;atisfi|ed: by his knowledge &s;hall my righteous &s;ervant ju&s;tify many, for he &s;hall bear their iniquities. I&s;aiah liii. 10, 11. Chri&s;t loved us, and hath given him|&s;elf for us, an offering and a &s;acrifice to God for a &s;weet &s;melling &s;avour. Eph. v. 2. Wherefore he is able to &s;ave them to the uttermo&s;t that come unto God by him, &s;eeing he ever liveth to make interce&s;|&s;ion for them. Heb. vii. 25. Yet this author, in his &s;econd argument, &s;ays, "If this great work could not be fini&s;hed until divine ju&s;tice had its free and natural cour&s;e, in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e, as that his &s;ufferings are to be con&s;idered as &s;in puni&s;hed; the con&s;e|quence is unavoidable, that he in a <HI>very &s;hort &s;ea&s;on</HI> endured the &s;ame quantity of mi&s;ery which would have borne &s;inners down to eternity. A thought which ex|ceeds all rules of computation, and departs from all principles of ju&s;t rea&s;oning." As if the Son of God could not do more in a &s;hort time, than &s;inful men can ever do. Man was fir&s;t drawn, into rebellion again&s;t God, by &s;etting up rea&s;on above revelation; and the world is &s;till held in bondage by the &s;ame means. Yet our author &s;ays, "Let no one be
<PB N="293" REF="030011_0292_0FE3C20889E7C058">alarmed, if we po&s;itively deny, that he &s;uffered any of that divine wrath which &s;inners ju&s;tly de&s;erve; for there can no &s;uch contradictory idea exi&s;t, that a being &s;hould be <HI>angry</HI> with an object with which he is at the &s;ame time <HI>well plea&s;ed.</HI>"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 21, 33.</NOTE> But how weak is this rea&s;oning! For a parent cannot correct a child as he ought, if he is angry with the child; neither can a judge give &s;entence again&s;t a debtor, or a criminal, if he feels angry with them. And when a &s;urety freely engages to pay the debt of an|other, ju&s;tice as clearly exacts the debt of him as of the debtor, while the di&s;charge of the debtor is as great a mercy as it would have been if the creditor had forgiven him without a &s;urety. And when a &s;inner is convinced of the greatne&s;s of his debt, and God frankly forgives him all, the &s;inner will love him much. Luke vii. 41, 42, 47. For the love of Chri&s;t con&s;traineth us, becau&s;e we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead; and that he died for all, that they which live &s;hould not hence|forth live unto them&s;elves, but unto him who died for them, and ro&s;e again.&mdash;Therefore if any man be in Chri&s;t, he is a new creature; old things are pa&s;t away, behold, all things are become new. 2 Cor. v, 14&mdash;17. Fear and love are the great principles of all voluntary actions, and they were divided by the fall; but Chri&s;t took on him fle&s;h and blood, of the &s;eed of Abraham, that through death he might de&s;troy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; and deliver them who through fear of death were all their life-time &s;ubject to bondage. Heb. ii. 14&mdash;16. And herein the promi&s;e of God to Abraham was accompli&s;hed, who &s;aid, My covenant &s;hall be in your fle&s;h for an everla&s;ting covenant. Gen. xvii. 13. For Chri&s;t was given for a covenant of the people, and for a light of the Gentiles. I&s;aiah xlii. 6.</P>

<P N="1">I. THE royal prophet &s;ays, Surely the wrath of man &s;hall prai&s;e thee: the remainder of wrath &s;halt thou re&s;train. And this truth &s;hines with great clearne&s;s in our day, and as clearly in Vermont, as in any part of our country. All the lands therein were once claimed by the government of New-Hamp&s;hire, and Bennington was named from Ben|ning Wentworth, the governor who granted the town. He al&s;o granted a large number of other towns on the we&s;t &s;ide of Connecticut-river, and made much money thereby, until &s;ome politicians of New York obtained an act of the king in council, in 1764, to annex all tho&s;e lands to their government. Many of tho&s;e who had purcha&s;ed lands of Went|worth, had made large improvements thereon; and to have all their property taken away deceitfully, or to buy it again of men who&s;e government they di&s;liked, rai&s;ed a high degree of re&s;entment again&s;t them; and the controver&s;y was pur&s;ued for ten years, which produced a hardy &s;et of men, who did great exploits in the American war, in the time of which they formed them&s;elves into a di&s;tinct government, and they are now owned as one of our United States.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Balknap's Hi&s;tory of New-Hamp&s;hire, Vol. II, p. 314&mdash;316, 455.</NOTE>
<PB N="295" REF="030011_0294_0FE3C20E026DFA90">And the folly of many in Connecticut and the Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts, who ran into debt at the clo&s;e of the wars in 1763 and 1783, cau&s;ed the planting of the wilder|ne&s;s in New-Hamp&s;hire and Vermont, beyond what human wi&s;dom could po&s;&s;ibly have done. The Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts had made &s;ome beginnings at Northfield before the war which began in 1675, and we are well informed that there was not one Engli&s;h family &s;et|tled above Number Four, about fifty miles from Northfield, until the peace of 1763. In all that time the French and Engli&s;h were contending with each other about lands which neither of them had any right to, and were employing the Savages in their quarrels until the French gave up their claim to this continent. And then Britain engaged in the cruel de&s;ign of en&s;laving her own &s;ubjects, and forced them to renounce their power, and the French a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed them in obtaining their liberty, and thereby learn|ed how to a&s;&s;ert their own rights; upon which Brit|ain hath deluged their land with blood, to prevent the prevalence of light and liberty in Europe. Po|pery is aboli&s;hed in France, much more than it is in England, and this hath rai&s;ed the cry of many teach|ers and lawyers again&s;t them, repre&s;enting them as bloody infidels! But we ever &s;hould remember, that hypocrites were much more fierce for the crucifixion or our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t than Heathen infidels were; and they are ever &s;o again&s;t true religion and liberty. And can men be blinded by them any longer? For God &s;ent &s;uch a drought and &s;carcity into Canada in 1795, as compelled them to have recour&s;e to Ver|mont and New-Hamp&s;hire for food for man and bea&s;t, where they had a plenty of both. Yea, En|gland her&s;elf now wants food from America, where they have cruelly oppre&s;&s;ed the inhabitants heretofore.</P>
<P N="2">II. The fir&s;t Bapti&s;t church in Vermont was form|ed in Shaft&s;bury in 1768. Mr. Bli&s;s Willoughby, who was ordained pa&s;tor of a &s;eparate church at
<PB N="296" REF="030011_0295_0FE3C1A266FBACE0">Newent, in Norwich, in 1753, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent to England as an agent for their churches in 1756, and preached for Dr. Gifford, in London, became a Bapti&s;t after the year 1764, and was a leader among this people, where his &s;on Ebenezer has al&s;o been a teacher, though neither of them have been pa&s;tors of this church. On Augu&s;t 4, 1774, the church wrote that they had thirty-nine members, twenty-one of whom were males. But how things were among them for &s;ix years after, we know not. A &s;econd church was formed in 1780, and a third in 1781, the la&s;t of them upon the principles of the old Bapti&s;ts, who held laying on of hands upon every member as a term of communion. And the A&s;&s;ociation which was begun there in 1781, and hath united a large num|ber of other churches, yet hath not united all the&s;e in the town where it began. But to promote union among them, many of the brethren &s;ent an earne&s;t reque&s;t to Mr. Caleb Blood, of Newton, and he re|moved there in the beginning of 1788, when a fourth church was formed, which had one hundred and twenty-four members the next year, and one hun|dred and &s;ixty in 1795. Mr. Blood is &s;o much e&s;|teemed in their government, that he was called to preach their Election Sermon, October 11, 1792, which was publi&s;hed by their authority. One pa&s;&s;age therein &s;ays, "A wi&s;e magi&s;trate will &s;et a con&s;tant guard over the words of his mouth; that with a be|coming moderation, he may expre&s;s his re&s;entment of injuries done him, and have all his language &s;uch as &s;hall tend to prevent others from an uncivil, pro|fane way of treating their fellow citizens. A magi&s;|trate who is rough and profane in his language, is a mon&s;trous character. He is not civil him&s;elf, and we cannot expect but that the practice, at lea&s;t, will do hurt in the community. He is not the gentle|man, for any per&s;on of &s;en&s;e knows, that a rough, profane way of treating mankind, better fits the char|acter

<P N="3">III. After the &s;ettlement of Pownal, the people lived for &s;ome time in a very carele&s;s way, neglect|ing public wor&s;hip, and indulging them&s;elves in all kinds of vanity and iniquity, until they were vi&s;ited with di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ickne&s;s, in March, 1773, which alarmed their con&s;ciences, and they &s;et up the wor|&s;hip of God among them, and the Spirit of God fixed conviction in many minds, and about two hun|dred often attended their meetings. A church was formed in April, which increa&s;ed to 49 members in fifteen months. This is a &s;ummary of the ac|count which the church gave in July, 1774. How things were among them for ten years after, we know not; but in the &s;pring of 1788, elder Caleb Nichols removed there, having been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the church in Coventry, and this church joined to the Shaft&s;bury A&s;&s;ociation in 1793, when they had &s;eventy-two members; and &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing was grant|ed there, that they increa&s;ed to one hundred and &s;ixty-five in two years. I mu&s;t leave the other churches in this county as they appear in the forego|ing li&s;t.</P>

<P N="4">IV. As people removed very fa&s;t into this county towards the clo&s;e of the war, &s;everal Bapti&s;t mini&s;|ters were &s;ent to preach among them from year to year. In May, 1779, our elders Seamans and Le|doyt vi&s;ited tho&s;e parts, and laboured in various places to good purpo&s;e. And Mr. Eli&s;ha Ran&s;om, who was ordained at Sutton, November 11, 1778, is a travelling mini&s;ter, removed up to Wood&s;tock,
<PB N="298" REF="030011_0297_0FE3C1A7E193D728">where a Bapti&s;t church was formed in July, 1780, and he became their mini&s;ter. He came as one of their me&s;&s;engers, and joined the Warren A&s;&s;ociation in September following, when they had twenty-eight members. And in three years they increa&s;ed to eighty members, when, in February, 1783, they joined with three other churches in forming the Wood&s;tock A&s;&s;ociation, to which a fifth church join|ed that year, and opened a corre&s;pondence with the Warren A&s;&s;ociation, which hath continued ever &s;ince. In three years the A&s;&s;ociation increa&s;ed to fourteen churches, and four hundred and ninety-&s;ix members. The&s;e churches were tho&s;e of Wood&s;tock, Canaan, Croydon, Sutton, Wendel, Lebanon, Roy|alton, &s;econd in Wood&s;tock, Claremont, Temple, Wind&s;or, We&s;tmin&s;ter, We&s;tmoreland, and Marlow. Mr. Joel Butler was ordained in Wood&s;tock, Janua|ry 5, 1785, and mini&s;tered to their &s;econd church for &s;ome time, and then he laboured in &s;everal places in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, from whence he removed into the State of New-York. As the members of this church were chiefly di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the fir&s;t, they have &s;ince re-united in one again. Mr. William Grow, mentioned above, removed from Pomfret, in Con|necticut, to Bridgwater, in Vermont, and recovered his credit &s;o far, by a penitent and good behaviour, that he was &s;ettled as the pa&s;tor of a church gathered in Wood&s;tock and Bridgwater, and for two or three years they appeared to pro&s;per; but then new diffi|culties aro&s;e, and he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. I find that Mr. John Peckens, who went from Middleborough, and who had been ordained at Claremont, was at Wood|&s;tock in 1786, who is now at Chelmsford. Mr. Jo|&s;eph Call was al&s;o an ordained elder there in 1789, who was at Cambridge in 1793. This work has &s;pread into Canada, where a Bapti&s;t church was form|ed at Coldwell's Manor, which joined to the Wood|&s;tock A&s;&s;ociation in 1794. And elder Jedidiah Heb|bard
<PB N="299" REF="030011_0298_0FE3C21865706D48">&s;ays, "I have been four journeys into tho&s;e parts, and have &s;een much of the power and grace of God there."</P>
<P N="5">V. Mr. Ran&s;om has not only been a &s;ucce&s;sful preacher of the go&s;pel, but al&s;o has earne&s;tly con|tended for Chri&s;tian liberty, again&s;t the mini&s;terial tyranny which hath been carried into that wilder|ne&s;s, from the States of Connecticut and the Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts. And on March 23, 1795, he &s;aid in a letter, "A brother living in Hartford, in Vermont, belonging to elder Drew's church, has &s;uffered much about rates from another denomination. He was fir&s;t carried to gaol, and then came out by paying the money, and pro&s;ecuted them in vain, for he was beat three times. I cannot a&s;certain the co&s;ts, for his la&s;t trial was the la&s;t day of February pa&s;t; but it is &s;uppo&s;ed that his co&s;ts will be above fifty pounds. Five petitions were carried into the Ver|mont a&s;&s;embly la&s;t fall, with more than two hundred &s;igners, again&s;t the certificate law, and I went to &s;peak for them; and after my averment that the certi|ficate law was contrary to the rights of man, of con|&s;cience, the fir&s;t, third, fourth, and &s;eventh articles of our con&s;titution, and to it&s;elf, for it took away our rights, and then offered to &s;ell them back to us for a certificate, &s;ome &s;tretched their mouths; and though no man contradicted me in one argument, yet they would &s;hut their eyes, and &s;ay they could not &s;ee it &s;o. I had many great friends in the hou&s;e, but not a majority. They &s;ent out a committee who altered the law much for the better, if any law could be good of that kind, which was, that every man might a&s;&s;ert his own &s;entiments to the town clerk, and that &s;hould an&s;wer; but becau&s;e it would &s;till be a bad law, and I would not thank them for it, and none of our friends would acknowledge it as a &s;avour, it fell back to where it was before. Only we have this to comfort us, The Lord reigneth, and
<PB N="300" REF="030011_0299_0FE3BB539C6E6588">their power is limited, and we &s;hall have no more affliction than is needful for us. Duty is ours, the event is the Lord's." And as I failed of obtaining more accounts of their churches, and of their &s;uffer|ings in Vermont, which were expected, I &s;hall clo&s;e this chapter with &s;ome late things in the Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts, the mother of all the per&s;ecutions in New-England.</P>
<P N="6">VI. God &s;aid to the church of I&s;rael, Behold ye fa&s;t for &s;trife and debate, and to &s;mite with the fi&s;t of wickedne&s;s.&mdash;Wilt thou call this a fa&s;t, an ac|ceptable day to the Lord? Is not this the fa&s;t that I have cho&s;en? to loo&s;e the bands of wickedne&s;s, and to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the op|pre&s;&s;ed go free, and that ye break every yoke? I&s;aiah lviii. 4&mdash;6. And is not this language applicable to our country? For di&s;&s;enters from the e&s;tabli&s;hed wor&s;hip in New-England were &s;everal times relieved from cruel oppre&s;&s;ion, by &s;pecial acts of the Briti&s;h court. But when our fir&s;t Congre&s;s was called at Philadelphia, in the fall of 1774, and they were like to be our highe&s;t power of government for the fu|ture, the Warren A&s;&s;ociation &s;ent an agent there to try if &s;ome &s;ecurity for our religious rights could not be obtained, while we united with our country-men in defence of the civil rights of America. And a conference was granted by the delegates in Con|gre&s;s from the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, to whom the Bapti&s;t agent declared, that we wanted no more religious liberty in the country, than they had long enjoyed in Bo&s;ton; and this appeared &s;o rea&s;onable to the gentlemen who were pre&s;ent, that &s;aid delegates promi&s;ed to u&s;e their influence to obtain &s;uch liberty through all the country. Yet a report was &s;pread in New-England, before the Bapti&s;t agent got home, that he had been to Philadelphia on purpo&s;e to try to break the union of the colonies in the defence of their civil rights. Therefore he &s;oon met the com|mittee
<PB N="301" REF="030011_0300_0FE3BB4A2A9B68E0">of the Warren A&s;&s;ociation at Bo&s;ton, and pre&s;ented an addre&s;s to the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts provincial congre&s;s upon it, and they returned an an&s;wer in which they &s;aid, "The e&s;tabli&s;hment of civil and re|ligious liberty, to each denomination in the province, is the &s;incere wi&s;h of this congre&s;s: But being by no means ve&s;ted with powers of civil government, whereby they can redre&s;s the grievances of any per|&s;on whatever, they therefore recommend to the Bap|ti&s;t churches, that when a General A&s;&s;embly &s;hall be convened in this colony, they lay the real grievances of &s;aid churches before the &s;ame, when and where their petition will mo&s;t certainly meet with all that attention due to the memorial of a denomination of Chri&s;tians &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed to the public weal of their country." Here they denied that they were ve&s;ted with powers of civil government, while they a&s;&s;umed the whole power of government in the Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts; and as a General A&s;&s;embly was called in July, 1775, the Warren A&s;&s;ociation pre&s;ented a me|morial to them in September, which they &s;lipped away out of &s;ight, without granting any relief at all to the Bapti&s;ts. And when the convention was call|ed, who formed our new con&s;titution, the fir&s;t draught that was made by their committee, was wholly partial for one denomination. They met and cho&s;e the committee to make the draught in September, and then adjourned to October 28, 1779. A general fa&s;t was appointed upon the occa&s;ion on November 4; and though the third article was new drawn, with &s;ome appearance of favour to di&s;&s;enters from their wor&s;hip, yet as they expected oppo&s;i|tion to it from the Bapti&s;ts, two men, who were members of Congre&s;s in 1774, accu&s;ed them of &s;ending an agent then to Philadelphia to break the union of the colonies, and evidently carried the vote for the third article by enflaming the convention again&s;t them. And was not this a fa&s;ting for &s;trife
<PB N="302" REF="030011_0301_0FE3BB4F605AEDB0">and debate, and &s;miting with the fi&s;t of wickedne&s;s? For the &s;ame men knew that they had promi&s;ed to exert all their influence to obtain all the liberty that the Bapti&s;ts a&s;ked for; but they have never fulfilled their promi&s;e to this day, although they have been in high offices in our government. And for any men to violate their promi&s;e, is to exalt them&s;elves above the eternal God, who never failed of fulfilling any one promi&s;e, nor ever can. Yet all men in this government, who &s;upport one denomination by tax and compul&s;ion, violate the promi&s;e in the con&s;titu|tion which &s;ays, "Every denomination of Chri&s;tians demeaning them&s;elves peaceably, and as good &s;ub|jects of the commonwealth, &s;hall be equally under the protection of the law; and no &s;ubordination of any one &s;ect or denomination to another, &s;hall ever be e&s;tabli&s;hed by law."</P>
<P N="7">VII. But as this has re&s;trained our legi&s;lature from making any certificate law to exempt the di&s;|&s;enters from the Congregational denomination from taxes to their wor&s;hip, and they have put the whole power into the hands of the majority of voters in each town or pari&s;h, this iniquity has no covering left among us. For mini&s;ters are &s;upported by worldly men, who act without any &s;ort of religious qualification, and therefore there is no religion in their doings. And they now violate the mo&s;t e&s;&s;en|tial rule of all civil government, which is, that the majority of every civil community is the body poli|tic, and that the minority is not the body. There|fore Mr. Ellis was never elected as pa&s;tor of the fir&s;t pari&s;h in Rehoboth,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ju&s;t before this work was fini&s;hed at the pre&s;s, news came from Reho|both, that a number who had been zealous for Mr. Ellis have turned again&s;t him, &s;o that he is gone off, not likely to return to be their mini&s;ter any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE> from whom many thou&s;ands of dollars have been taken for him; neither was Mr. Nathan Underwood ever elected the pa&s;tor of the &s;econd pari&s;h in Harwich, by the body of the pari&s;h, who have been all taxed to him. But Mr. Ellis's
<PB N="303" REF="030011_0302_0FE3BB5879F0AFF8">great &s;ucce&s;s appears to have emboldened Mr. Un|derwood, and his collector &s;eized &s;ix men who were Bapti&s;ts, on the fir&s;t day of December, 1795, and carried them as far as Yarmouth, where one of them was taken &s;o ill, being old and infirm before, that he &s;aw no way to &s;ave his life but to pay the tax and co&s;ts, which he did, and the other five were carried to the pri&s;on at Barn&s;table, where they al&s;o paid the money, rather than to lie in a cold pri&s;on all winter. And the&s;e things moved many to pay &s;aid tax, rather than to be &s;trained upon. Though as all did not do it, their collector went with aid to the hou&s;e of one of the Bapti&s;ts, when he was not at home, January 8, 1796, and &s;eized a cow for a tax to &s;aid mini&s;ter; but his wife and daughter came out and took hold of the cow, and his wife promi&s;ed to pay the money, if her hu&s;band would not do it, and they let the cow go, and &s;he went to Mr. Underwood the next day, and paid the tax and co&s;ts, and took his receipt therefor. Yet four days after, the woman and two daughters, one of whom was not there when the cow was taken, were &s;eized and carried before au|thority, and fined &s;even dollars, for talking to the collector and his aid, and taking hold of the cow while they had her in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;o that they let her go. The&s;e things we have had very di&s;tinct accounts of, and if there is the lea&s;t mi&s;take therein, let them point it out in welcome. Another in&s;tance in the county of Plymouth is &s;imilar to the&s;e in one re&s;pect, though not in others. The mini&s;ter of a pari&s;h, lately incorporated, was never cho&s;en by the major|ity of the inhabitants therein, nor by many who are taxed to him, one of whom was lately &s;eized to be carried to pri&s;on, but he paid the money, and others are threatened with the like treatment. Before this di&s;tre&s;s was made for the &s;alary of &s;aid mini&s;ter, he got &s;everal Bapti&s;t mini&s;ters to preach in his pulpit, and &s;eems to be in earne&s;t to draw them into com|pul&s;ive
<PB N="304" REF="030011_0303_0FE3C26311660E48">mea&s;ures al&s;o. Yet the line of his pari&s;h was extended eight or nine miles from his meeting, in order to take in two valuable lots of mini&s;terial lands, which lie near a Bapti&s;t meeting, where a Bap|ti&s;t mini&s;ter is &s;ettled. The&s;e are a few of the evils which have come from the practice of confounding the church and world together, about the government of the church, and the &s;upport of religious mini&s;ters. Whereas if the civil government would protect all its &s;ubjects impartially, without &s;upporting any min|i&s;ters by tax and compul&s;ion, all true believers would lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty, and the power of other men to oppre&s;s them on religious accounts would be taken away.</P>

But he that doth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manife&s;t that they are wrought in God. John iii. 20, 21. It is impo&s;&s;ible for God to violate his promi&s;e, or his oath, or to entice any into &s;in. Heb. vi. 13&mdash;18. James i. 13, 14. But all men are guilty of the&s;e evils, more or le&s;s, who are not born again. And when Con&s;tantine removed the &s;eat of his empire from Rome, and then divided it at his death, the way was made for the bi&s;hop of Rome to exalt him&s;elf above God in his church, and above all the kings of Europe, who gave their power unto him. And forbidding to marry, and commanding to ab&s;tain from meats, was held in that church for many centuries before Luther's ref|ormation. 1 Tim. iv. 1, 2, 3. Yet an external &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of bapti&s;ms, and of mini&s;terial power, through all tho&s;e abominations, is now held fa&s;t in our land, as we have before proved. Yea, and the doctrine of original &s;in, particular election, efficacious grace in conver&s;ion, ju&s;tification wholly by faith in the per|fect righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, and the final per&s;ever|ance of his &s;aints, is denied by multitudes in Europe and America.

II. When the Jews returned from Babylon, and began to build the temple, their enemies &s;ent fal&s;e accu&s;ations again&s;t them to the court of Per&s;ia, and procured an order from thence to force them to cea&s;e from that work. But after another king came to the throne, two prophets were rai&s;ed up, to reprove the Jews for their negligence, and to en|courage them to fini&s;h the hou&s;e of God. Ezra iv. 11&mdash;24. v. 1, 2. And becau&s;e the old men wept to &s;ee how much inferior this hou&s;e was, to the glo|rious temple which was built by Solomon, one prophet &s;aid to them, I am with you, &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts; according to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, &s;o my <HI>Spirit</HI> remaineth among you; fear ye not.

The other prophet had a candle&s;tick all of gold, &s;et before him, with medi|ums to convey oil into it for light; and upon his inquiry what was meant thereby, the an&s;wer was.

And when they obeyed this call of God, their enemies wrote again to the court of Per&s;ia again&s;t them, but a decree in their favour was pro|cured thereby, and all was plain before them. Ezra v. 7&mdash;17. vi. 1&mdash;16. The golden candle&s;tick repre|&s;ented the church of God, and the two olive-trees were his precepts and promi&s;es, whereby he poured the oil of his grace into his church, to hold up light to the world, who hated it becau&s;e it tormented their con&s;ciences. Before the coming of Chri&s;t there was but one candle&s;tick, with two olive-trees to pour oil into it; but when Chri&s;t came he broke down the middle wall of partition between Jews and Gentiles, and built his church upon the foundation of the <HI>apo&s;tles</HI> and <HI>prophets,</HI> for an habitation of God through the <HI>Spirit.</HI> Eph. ii. 14&mdash;22.

<P N="4">IV. And is it not evident that the late increa&s;e of Bapti&s;t churches hath been cau&s;ed by the influ|ence of the Spirit of God? For before he poured out his Spirit in the county of Hamp&s;hire, in and after 1734, there were but &s;ix Bapti&s;t churches in all New-England, except in Rhode-I&s;land govern|ment, wherein are now two hundred and eighty-five churches. And in the&s;e four States, where mini&s;|ters have been &s;upported by law, all the power of &s;uch mini&s;ters and rulers have been again&s;t the Bap|ti&s;t churches; and they have found &s;o much diffi|culty in &s;upporting their own mini&s;ters, and in guard|ing again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion from others, that &s;ome &s;ocie|ties have obtained incorporations by the laws of men. But our A&s;&s;ociations have publi&s;hed te&s;timo|nies again&s;t all &s;uch incorporations, as they implicitly deny that the laws and Spirit of Chri&s;t are &s;ufficient to govern his church, and to &s;upport his mini&s;ters. And while they act all the affairs of their A&s;&s;ocia|tions

If heavely influence hath not increa&s;ed their churches, what cau&s;e can be a&s;&s;igned therefor? All true believers in Chri&s;t are born again, not of blood, nor of the will of the fle&s;h, nor of the will of man, but of God. John i. 12, 13. Natural de&s;cent, the power of our own wills, and of the wills of other men, are all excluded from this affair. And where the oppo&s;ite principles have crept into Bapti&s;t churches, their welfare has been ob&s;truct|ed thereby, and many &s;uch churches have been di&s;|&s;olved. Yet the word and Spirit of God have re|formed old churches, and rai&s;ed many new ones in all parts of America. There was one Bapti&s;t church in Virginia, and a few in the Carolinas &s;eventy years ago; but they were dark and feeble &s;ocieties, until &s;ome &s;piritual preachers were &s;ent among them, in and after 1753. The elders, Benjamin Miller, I&s;aac Stelle, Peter Peter&s;on Vanhorne, and John Gano, went from New-Jer&s;ey and Penn&s;ylvania, and labour|ed in tho&s;e parts to good purpo&s;e. And elder Shu|bael Stearns, Daniel Mar&s;hall, and others, went from Connecticut, and &s;pent their lives in tho&s;e part, as was before ob&s;erved; and how great has been the increa&s;e of the Bapti&s;t churches in tho&s;e &s;outhern States! And though va&s;t pains have been taken, by men who have &s;upported their wor&s;hip by force, to make the people believe that the Bapti&s;ts were ene|mies to good government, yet how are they now confounded in tho&s;e attempts! For it now appears that government and liberty are united in their plan of conduct, which tends to bring all wars to an end. And in a prophecy concerning that glorious event, it is &s;aid, All people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the

John xv. 10, 19. How then will any men dare to confound the church and world together in religious affairs? For as long as natural birth could bring the children of I&s;rael into the church, and into the prie&s;thood, God &s;aid to them, The man that committeth adultery with another man's wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the adulterer and the adultere&s;s &s;hall &s;urely be put to death. Levir. xx. 10. And he now &s;ays to all the world, Ye adulterers and adul|tere&s;&s;es, know ye not that the friend&s;hip of the world in enmity with God? Who&s;oever therefore will be a friend of the world, is the enemy of God.&mdash;There is one lawgiver, who is able to &s;ave, and to de&s;troy: who art thou that judge&s;t another? James iv. 4, 12. Yet men in general have a&s;&s;umed the power of law-givers and judges for the church of Chri&s;t, and of bringing children into it before they could choo&s;e for them&s;elves; and they have invented a multitude of other names and denominations of men, be&s;ides the righteous and the wicked, the church and the world. Though the word of revelation &s;ays, Who|&s;oever is born of God, doth not commit &s;in; for his &s;eed remaineth in him; and he cannot &s;in, becau&s;e he is born of God. In this the children of God are manife&s;t, and the children of the devil: who&s;oever doth not righteou&s;ne&s;s, is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother. For this is the me&s;&s;age that ye have heard from the beginning, that we

Woe unto them; for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for re|ward, and peri&s;hed in the gain&s;aying of Core. Jude 11. Becau&s;e the wor&s;hip of Abel, by faith in the blood of Chri&s;t, was accepted of God, and the wor|&s;hip of Cain without &s;uch faith was not accepted, he was filled with envy again&s;t his brother. But the Lord &s;aid unto Cain, If thou do&s;t well, &s;halt thou not be accepted? and if thou do&s;t not well, &s;in lieth at the door. And unto thee &s;hall be his de&s;ire, and thou &s;halt rule over him. Gen. iv. 4&mdash;7. True be|lievers have ever been the be&s;t &s;ubjects of civil gov|ernment; but men have di&s;covered enmity again&s;t them in every age, becau&s;e of the light of holine&s;s which God hath cau&s;ed to &s;hine in their lives, to ex|po&s;e the hypocri&s;y and wickedne&s;s of others. But every man is guilty of <HI>adultery,</HI> who hath not been made dead to the works of the law, in order to be married to Je&s;us Chri&s;t.

But for this they peri&s;hed mo&s;t terribly. Numb. xvi. 1&mdash;3, 32, 33.

And the Spirit and the bride &s;ay, Come. And let him that heareth, &s;ay, Come; and let him that is athir&s;t, come; and who&s;oever will, let him take the water of life freely. Rev. xxi. 21. xxii. 14&mdash;17. And how clearly do the&s;e things &s;hew, that the government of the church of Chri&s;t is as di&s;tinct from all worldly governments, as heaven is from earth! Yea, and that none has any true right in his church, until he comes to Chri&s;t by faith which worketh by love that is as free as water! For God &s;ays, In the la&s;t days it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, that the mountain of the hou&s;e of the Lord &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;h|ed in the top of the mountains, and it &s;hall be ex|alted above the hills, and people &s;hall <HI>flow</HI> unto it. And many nations &s;hall come and &s;ay, Come;and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the hou&s;e of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths; for the law &s;hall go forth of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jeru&s;alem. And he &s;hall judge among many people, and rebuke &s;trong nations afar off, and they &s;hall beat their &s;words into plough&s;hares, and their &s;pears into pruning-hooks: nation &s;hall not lift up

Now all men may know, that this prophecy hath never yet been fulfilled; but it will as &s;urely be accompli&s;hed, as any prophecy ever was in this world.

<P N="7">VII. And no man can obey him without denying him&s;elf, and taking up his cro&s;s, and following the example of Chri&s;t. And the apo&s;tle Paul &s;ays to the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, I have not &s;hunned to declare unto you all the coun&s;el of God. Take heed there|fore unto your&s;elves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Gho&s;t hath made you over&s;eers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purcha&s;ed with his own blood. For I know this, that after my departing &s;hall grievous wolves enter in among you, not &s;paring the flock. Al&s;o of your&s;elves &s;hall men ari&s;e, &s;peaking perver&s;e things, to draw away di&s;ciples after them. Therefore watch, and remem|ber that by the &s;pace of three years, I cea&s;ed not to warn every one night and day with tears. And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up, and to give you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> inheritance among all them which are &s;anctified. I have coveted no man's &s;ilver, or gold, or apparel. Yea, you your&s;elves know, that the&s;e hands have mini&s;tered unto my nece&s;&s;ities, and to them that were with me. I have &s;hewed you all things, how that &s;o labouring ye ought to &s;upport the weak; and to remember the words of the Lord Je&s;us, how he &s;aid, It is more ble&s;&s;ed to give than to receive. Acts xx. 27&mdash;35. And how hath this pro|phecy been fulfilled in every age &s;ince it was pub|li&s;hed! And how few believe that God, and the word of his grace, is able to build up his church, and to guard again&s;t grievous wolves, and again&s;t perver&s;e &s;chi&s;matics, without the laws of men en|forced by the &s;word! Yea, how much hath the
<PB N="319" REF="030011_0318_0FE3C25A14D09530">&s;word promoted both of the&s;e evils? And how little do we believe, that it is more ble&s;&s;ed to give than to receive! It is ble&s;&s;ed to receive, when we receive in a right manner; but all things below peri&s;h in the u&s;ing, while all that is given for the benefit of the bodies or &s;ouls of others, is laying up trea&s;ure in heaven, which will turn to prai&s;e, honour and glory at the appearing of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And though Paul had written to the church of Corinth, upon their duty to &s;upport the preachers of the go&s;pel, yet as deceitful teachers had tried to de&s;troy his character, pretending that he acted from &s;elfi&s;h motives, he re|fu&s;ed to receive any &s;upport from them, until he could come and have tho&s;e accu&s;ations tried before that church, in the mouth of two or three witne&s;&s;es, according to the law of Chri&s;t. But as his refu&s;al to receive any thing of them, as he did of other churches, might &s;eem to be a di&s;honour to the church of Corinth, he &s;aid, Forgive me this wrong. 2 Cor. xi. 12. xii. 13. xiii. 1&mdash;4. And this &s;hews that a particular church of Chri&s;t is the highe&s;t judicature that he has e&s;tabli&s;hed upon earth, to carry his laws into execution in his name. And the people al&s;o are to act towards their mini&s;ters as they can an&s;wer it to God in the la&s;t day. For he &s;ays, The labourer is worthy of his reward. 1 Tim. v. 18. Let him that is taught in the word, communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things. Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for what&s;oever a man &s;oweth, that &s;hall he al&s;o reap. For he that &s;oweth to the fle&s;h, &s;hall of the fle&s;h reap corruption; but he that &s;oweth to the Spirit, &s;hall of the Spirit reap life ever|la&s;ting. And let us not be weary in well-doing; for in due &s;ea&s;on we &s;hall reap, if we faint not. Gal. vi. 6&mdash;9. Thus mini&s;ters and people are required to act towards each other, as they can an&s;wer the &s;ame to God, who only can ble&s;s or cur&s;e them in time and eternity. And Chri&s;t &s;ays to his mini&s;ters, He
<PB N="320" REF="030011_0319_0FE3BB399AA234F0">that heareth you heareth me; and he that de&s;pi&s;eth you de&s;pi&s;eth me; and he that de&s;pi&s;eth me, de&s;pi&s;|eth him that &s;ent me. Luke x. 16. And how &s;olemn are the&s;e con&s;iderations! Yea, and how &s;afe are all true believers in Chri&s;t!</P>
<P N="8">VIII. For he &s;ays, Upon this Rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell &s;hall not prevail again&s;t it. Matt. xvi. 18. And though many have made &s;trange work of this &s;aying, and others have paid no regard to it, yet many ancient pa&s;&s;ages may &s;erve to explain its va&s;t importance. For it is &s;aid of God's people of old, When he &s;lew them, then they &s;ought him; and they returned and inquired early after God. And they remembered that God was their Rock, and the high God their Redeemer. Neverthele&s;s, they did flatter him with their mouth, and they <HI>lied</HI> unto him with their tongues; for their <HI>heart</HI> was not right with him, neither were they &s;tedfa&s;t in his covenant. P&s;alm lxxviii. 34&mdash;37. Wherefore hear the word of the Lord, ye &s;cornful men that rule this people which is in Jeru&s;alem. Becau&s;e ye have &s;aid, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflow|ing &s;courge &s;hall pa&s;s through, it &s;hall no come unto us; for we have made <HI>lies</HI> our refuge, and under fal&s;ehood have we hid our&s;elves: therefore thus &s;aith the Lord God, Behold, I lay in Zion for a founda|tion, a &s;tone, a tried &s;tone, a precious corner-&s;tone, a &s;ure foundation; he that believeth &s;hall not make ha&s;te. Judgment al&s;o will I lay to the line, and righteou&s;ne&s;s to the plummet, and the hail &s;hall &s;weep away the refuge of <HI>lies,</HI> and the waters &s;hall overflow the hiding place; and your covenant with death &s;hall be di&s;annulled, and your agreement with hell &s;hall not &s;tand. I&s;aiah xxviii. 14&mdash;18. And this prophecy is applied to them who followed after the law of righteou&s;ne&s;s, but &s;ought it not by faith in Chri&s;t, but as it were by the works of the law. They
<PB N="321" REF="030011_0320_0FE3C25D52B35E68">had a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge. For they being ignorant of God's righteou&s;ne&s;s, and going about to e&s;tabli&s;h their own righteou&s;ne&s;s, have not &s;ubmitted them&s;elves unto the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God. For Chri&s;t is the end of the law for righteou&s;|ne&s;s to every one that believeth. And who&s;oever believeth on him, &s;hall not be a&s;hamed. Rom. ix. 31&mdash;33. x. 1&mdash;4. He that believeth on him &s;hall not be confounded. 1 Peter ii. 6. From whence we may learn, that all men who tru&s;t in their own doings, in&s;tead of the perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, are in covenant with death, and at agreement with hell. And earthly monarchy has generally been the darling of &s;uch men. Therefore God &s;ays to them, Thou wente&s;t to the king with <HI>ointment,</HI> and did&s;t increa&s;e thy perfumes, and did&s;t &s;end thy me&s;|&s;engers afar off, and did&s;t deba&s;e thy&s;elf even unto hell. Thou art wearied in the greatne&s;s of thy way, yet &s;aid&s;t thou not, There is no hope; thou ha&s;t found the life of thine hand, therefore thou wa&s;t not grieved. I&s;aiah lvii. 9, 10. David, and his race of kings, were <HI>anointed</HI> of the Lord to their office, as eminent types of Chri&s;t. And the rage of hypo|crites and infidels, again&s;t the Lord, and again&s;t his <HI>anointed,</HI> was again&s;t his <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> P&s;alm ii. 2. Acts iv. 26. And every child of God has the <HI>anointing</HI> of his Spirit abiding in him, which effectually teacheth the &s;oul to abide in Chri&s;t. 1 John ii. 27. But the calling any ruler, &s;ince the death of Chri&s;t, The Lord's <HI>anointed,</HI> and the &s;etting up any earthly heads to the church, is a practice which came from hell, from the bottomle&s;s pit; and this is the bea&s;t who cau&s;eth God's witne&s;&s;es to prophe&s;y in mourning, and at length kills them. Rev. xi. 7. xiii. 1, 2, 12. xvii. 8.</P>
<P N="9">IX. And the &s;aints have a gradual victory over him. For John &s;ays, I &s;aw as it were a &s;ea of gla&s;s, mingled with fire; and them that had gotten the
<PB N="322" REF="030011_0321_0FE3C265377524C0">victory over the bea&s;t, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, &s;tand on the &s;ea of gla&s;s, having the harps of God. And they &s;ing the &s;ong of Mo&s;es, the &s;ervant of God, and the &s;ong of the Lamb, &s;aying, Great and marvel|lous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; ju&s;t and true are thy ways, thou King of &s;aints. Who &s;hall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy; for all nations &s;hall come and wor&s;hip before thee, for thy judg|ments are made manife&s;t. Rev. xv. 2&mdash;4. The &s;ea of gla&s;s, mingled with fire, is the word of God, en|forced upon the &s;ouls of men by his Holy Spirit. For one apo&s;tle &s;ays, Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. But we all with open face, be|holding as in a <HI>gla&s;s</HI> the glory of the Lord, are changed into the &s;ame image, from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. 2 Cor. iii. 17, 18. And another &s;ays, Lay apart all filthine&s;s, and &s;uper|fluity of naughtine&s;s, and receive with meekne&s;s the ingrafted word, which is able to &s;ave your &s;ouls. But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own &s;elves. For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a <HI>gla&s;s;</HI> for he behold|eth him&s;elf, and goeth his way, and &s;traightway for|getteth what manner of man he was. But who&s;o looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continu|eth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed in his deed. James i. 21&mdash;25. And when a prophet met with mo&s;t cruel treatment, he &s;aid, I will not make mention of him, nor &s;peak any more in his name. But his word was in mine heart as a burn|ing <HI>fire</HI> &s;hut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not &s;tay. And God &s;ays, The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him &s;peak
<PB N="323" REF="030011_0322_0FE3C26AACDD32F0">my word faithfully: what is the chaff to the wheat? &s;aith the Lord. Is not my word like as a <HI>fire?</HI> &s;aith the Lord, and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces? Jer. xx. 9. xxiii. 28, 29. Therefore they who &s;tand upon the &s;ea of gla&s;s mingled with fire, are they who hear and obey the revealed will of God. Mo&s;es was the lawgiver to the church of I&s;rael, and the Lamb is &s;o to the church of God among all nations. And Mo&s;es verily was faithful in all his hou&s;e as a &s;ervant, for a te&s;timony of tho&s;e things which were to be &s;poken after; but Chri&s;t as a Son over his own hou&s;e; who&s;e hou&s;e are we, if we hold fa&s;t the confidence, and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.&mdash;Now faith is the &s;ub&s;tance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not &s;een. Heb. iii. 5, 6. xi. 1. And how clearly do the&s;e pa&s;|&s;ages prove, that true believers in Chri&s;t are the only per&s;ons of whom his hou&s;e or church is compo&s;ed! For no others can hold fa&s;t the confidence, and the rejoicing of hope of &s;alvation in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The bea&s;t appears to be the church of Rome, over many nations; his image, all national churches; his mark, all &s;upporting of wor&s;hip by tax and compul&s;ion, and the number of his name, includes all the &s;chemes of men to hold the church in bondage, &s;o that &s;he might not be governed wholly by the laws of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="10">X. And this may lead us to con&s;ider, what is intended by the killing and re&s;urrection of the two witne&s;&s;es. If they be the two parts of the holy &s;crip|tures, believed and obeyed by the children of God, then their death is the triumphing of the world over them. And the prophecy &s;ays, When they &s;hall have fini&s;hed their te&s;timony, the bea&s;t that a&s;cend|eth out of the bottomle&s;s pit &s;hall make war again&s;t them, and &s;hall overcome them, and kill them.

And they that dwell upon the earth &s;hall rejoice over them, and make merry, and &s;hall &s;end gifts one to another; becau&s;e the&s;e two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth. Rev. xi. 7&mdash;10. Our Lord was crucified by hypocrites and infidels; and he declared tho&s;e hypocrites to be wor&s;e than the old Sodomites. Matt. xi. 23, 24. Luke x. 12. And God &s;aid in prophecy, Sodom thy &s;i&s;|ter hath not done, &s;he nor her daughters, as thou ha&s;t done, thou and thy daughters. Behold, this was the iniquity of Sodom, Pride, fulne&s;s of bread, and abundance of idlene&s;s was in her and in her daughters, neither did &s;he &s;trengthen the hand of the poor and needy. And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me; therefore I took them away as I &s;aw good. Neither hath Samaria committed half thy &s;ins; but thou ha&s;t multiplied thine abominations more than they.&mdash;Neverthele&s;s, I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will e&s;tabli&s;h unto thee an ever|la&s;ting covenant. Then thou &s;halt remember thy ways, and be a&s;hamed, when thou &s;halt receive thy &s;i&s;ters, thine elder and thy younger; and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy cov|enant. Ezek. xvi. 48&mdash;51, 60, 61. According to which prophecy, the church of Chri&s;t was erected in Jeru&s;alem, and &s;he received the Samaritans, and then the Gentiles into the church as daughters, but not by the covenant of circumci&s;ion, which the Jews were in after the Samaritans were &s;eparated from them.

But it is &s;aid of fal&s;e teachers under the go&s;pel, As Jannes and Jam|bres with&s;tood Mo&s;es, &s;o do the&s;e al&s;o re&s;i&s;t the truth; men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith. 2 Tim. iii. 8. Jannes and Jambres were ma|gicians of Egypt, who hardened the heart of Pharaoh again&s;t the call of God, to let I&s;rael go and &s;erve him according to his own in&s;titutions. And Sodom was never more &s;et again&s;t purity, nor Egypt again&s;t lib|erty, than the world now are again&s;t the purity and liberty of the go&s;pel. For truth is fallen in the &s;treet, and equity cannot enter. I&s;aiah lix. 14.

So that the re&s;urrection of the two witne&s;&s;es, in the eleventh chapter, and the re&s;urrection of the &s;ouls of the faithful, in the twentieth chapter, appear to be the &s;ame glorious event, given under different views. For our Lord &s;aid to John, Write the things which thou ha&s;t &s;een, and the things which are, and the things which &s;hall be hereafter. Rev. i. 19. When Chri&s;t was born of a virgin, in the true church of God, the nation of I&s;rael was part of the Roman empire, which had &s;even heads, and ten horns; and Herod &s;ought to &s;lay the child Je&s;us, as &s;oon as he was born, and Pilate crucified him, after which he was caught up unto God, and to his throne, where he will rule all nations with a rod of iron, and da&s;h them in pieces like a potter's ve&s;&s;el.

And deceitful teachers have ever been the meane&s;t and wor&s;t of all men upon earth, and they were the tail of the drag|on in the Roman empire. But no men who have &s;uppo&s;ed that this twelfth chapter &s;peaks of another child who &s;hould be born after the apo&s;tolic age, could ever give any rational account of him. Many have &s;uppo&s;ed it was Con&s;tantine, the fir&s;t emperor who owned the Chri&s;tian name; but he divided the empire, and prepared the way for the advance|ment of the man of &s;in, as we have before proved. And after the a&s;cen&s;ion of Chri&s;t to heaven, it was &s;aid, Now is come &s;alvation and &s;trength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Chri&s;t; for the accu&s;er of our brethren is ca&s;t down, which accu&s;ed them before our God day and night. And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their te&s;timony; and they loved not their lives unto the death. Rev. xii. 10, 11. In this way the power of the devil was de&s;troyed in the old Roman empire. And when Satan &s;hall be bound, &s;o as not to deceive the nations any more, the proph|ecy &s;ays, I &s;aw thrones, and they &s;at upon them, and judgment was given unto them; and I &s;aw the &s;ouls of them that were beheaded for the witne&s;s of Je&s;us, and for the word of God, and which had not wor|&s;hipped the bea&s;t, neither his image, neither had re|ceived his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Chri&s;t a thou&s;and years. But the re&s;t of the dead lived not again until the thou&s;and years were fini&s;hed. This is the fir&s;t re&s;urrection. Rev. xx. 4, 5. And is not this the &s;ame re&s;urrection which is &s;poken of in the eleventh chapter? For the kingdoms of this world will become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chri&s;t, according to each of the&s;e prophecies. And

And as all men are dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, until they are made alive to God, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord, and yet they have ever a&s;&s;umed the place of lawgivers and judges for the church of Chri&s;t, I be|lieve that when God &s;ays, The re&s;t of the dead lived not again until the thou&s;and years were fini&s;hed, he means that they &s;hall not have the power of govern|ment over the church, as they have ever had &s;ince the ri&s;e of antichri&s;t. For as Chri&s;t is the only Hu&s;|band of his church, how much like Sodom are all men who a&s;&s;ume any power of government over her in religious affairs, &s;o as to hinder her from obeying him as a cha&s;te virgin! There were &s;ome mini&s;ters of the devil, who transformed them&s;elves as the min|i&s;ters of righteou&s;ne&s;s, in the apo&s;tolic age, who&s;e end was according to their works. 2 Cor. xi. 2&mdash;15. And we may well conclude that there are many &s;uch in our day; and how pernicious is their influence among all people who receive them! And &s;upport|ing &s;uch with the &s;word, is u&s;ing of it to uphold the kingdom of the devil. Neverthele&s;s, the foundation of God &s;tandeth &s;ure, having this &s;eal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And let every one that nameth the name of Chri&s;t, depart from iniquity.</P>
<P N="12">XII. We readily grant, that no prophecy of &s;cripture was ever clearly under&s;tood by men, until the event explained it. The di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t
<PB N="329" REF="030011_0328_0FE3C28999BD85F8">knew not the &s;criptures that he was to ri&s;e again from the dead, until he appeared to them, and ex|plained the prophecies concerning it. Luke xxiv. 25&mdash;27. John xx. 9. And how long was it before they were clearly convinced that circumci&s;ion was aboli&s;hed? And it is mo&s;t evident that all national churches have &s;prung from an abu&s;e of the covenant of circumci&s;ion. That covenant gave I&s;rael a right to &s;eize upon the lands of the heathen in Canaan, and to buy others for &s;ervants; and all the planta|tions that have been made in America, under the name of Chri&s;tianity, have been made by tho&s;e who imagined that Chri&s;tians had a right to deal thus with all heathens. But as our Lord hath expre&s;sly excluded &s;lavery, and the u&s;e of the &s;word of the magi&s;trate from the government of his church, we may know that all the&s;e things belong to my&s;tery Babylon. Literal Babylon had her name from Babel, where they &s;aid, Let us build us a city and a tower who&s;e top may reach unto heaven, and let us make us a name, le&s;t we be &s;cattered abroad upon the face of all the earth. Gen. xi. 4. And is not the pur|&s;uit of all men naturally, to get to heaven by their own doings, and to make them&s;elves a name upon the earth? Babel &s;ignifies <HI>confu&s;ion;</HI> and an in&s;pired apo&s;tle &s;ays, Where envying and &s;trife is, there is <HI>confu&s;ion,</HI> and every evil work. But the wi&s;dom that is from above, is fir&s;t pure, then peaceable, gentle, and ea&s;y to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocri&s;y. James iii. 16, 17. And no men have this wi&s;dom, but they who are born again by the Spirit of God. And to &s;uch another apo&s;tle &s;ays, We have not fol|lowed cunningly devi&s;ed fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, but were eye-witne&s;&s;es of his maje&s;ty. For he received from God the Father, honour and glory, when there came &s;uch a voice to him from
<PB N="330" REF="030011_0329_0FE3C28CEA0C82D8">the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well plea&s;ed. And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount. We have al&s;o a more &s;ure word of prophecy, whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that &s;hineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-&s;tar ari&s;e in your hearts; knowing this fir&s;t, that no prophecy of the &s;cripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man; but holy men of God &s;pake as they were moved by the Holy Gho&s;t. But there were fal&s;e prophets al&s;o among the people, even as there &s;hall be fal&s;e teach|ers among you, who privily &s;hall bring in damnable here&s;ies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon them&s;elves &s;wift de&s;truction. And many &s;hall follow their pernicious ways, by rea&s;on of whom the way of truth &s;hall be evil &s;poken of. And through covetou&s;ne&s;s, &s;hall they with feigned words make merchandize of you; who&s;e judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damna|tion &s;lumbereth not. 2 Peter i. 16&mdash;21. ii. 1&mdash;3. And how clearly are our times here de&s;cribed! For the fleets and armies which have filled the world with confu&s;ion and &s;lavery, have been rai&s;ed and up|held by national churches; and their va&s;t funds of money, which are daily bought and &s;old by deceit|ful men to enrich them&s;elves, have been kept in credit by the labours of the faithful. Thus, God &s;ays, &s;hall they make merchandize of you. And if it had not been for this wicked conduct our na|tional debt might all have been paid off before now. But in&s;tead of it the debt is daily increa&s;ing, and many have tried all their arts to draw America into another war with foreign nations. Though when the church of Chri&s;t &s;hall be wholly governed by his laws, above all the powers of the world, Nation
<PB N="331" REF="030011_0330_0FE3C2928EDEC728">&s;hall not lift up &s;word again&s;t nation, neither &s;hall they learn war any more. I&s;aiah ii. 1&mdash;4.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. But, in&s;tead of &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing, more blood hath been &s;hed in latter ages, by the nations who have borne the name of Chri&s;tianity, than by all other nations in the world; and this is now loudly proclaimed in Europe and America, as a &s;trong ar|gument again&s;t divine revelation. Whereas we have ju&s;t &s;een that damnable here&s;ies will cau&s;e the way of truth to be evil &s;poken of. The light of revela|tion hath ever enlarged the capacities of men, beyond any other means in the world; but they who have not received the word into an <HI>hone&s;t and good heart,</HI> have been hardened afterwards like a rock, or have been as &s;harp as thorns, to tare away the property, or to de&s;troy the lives of others. Luke viii. 4&mdash;15. But that which beareth thorns and briers is reject|ed, and is nigh unto cur&s;ing, who&s;e end is to be burned. Heb. vi. 8. Yet many teachers now bring this la&s;t pa&s;&s;age, to prove that the true children of God may fall away and peri&s;h forever; while others are holding up hell as a purging fire, which will finally purge away all &s;in from every child of Adam; as if the &s;ufferings of a creature could purge away &s;in, in&s;tead of the blood of Chri&s;t applied by the Spirit of God. Thus they crucify to them&s;elves the Son of God afre&s;h, and put him to an open &s;hame. His per&s;on was crucified between two thieves, and his cau&s;e is crucified between oppo&s;ite teachers and profe&s;&s;ors. But our Lord &s;ays, Enter ye in at the &s;trait gate; for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to de&s;truction, and many there be who go in thereat; becau&s;e &s;trait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it. Matt. vii. 13, 14. Though the world is full of men who deny this, and who bring in damnable <HI>here&s;ies.</HI> And they have perverted this word &s;o much, as often to turn it again&s;t all tho&s;e
<PB N="332" REF="030011_0331_0FE3C29746751380">who have withdrawn from worldly churches, while others have applied the word to doctrines rather than practice. But if we take our ideas from the word of God, and not from the traditions of men, we may find that here&s;y means <HI>rebellion</HI> again&s;t God in his church. For when the Jews accu&s;ed Paul of &s;edition, and being a leader of a new &s;ect, he denied the charge, and &s;aid. After the way which they call here&s;y, &s;o wor|&s;hip I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and the prophets. Acts xxiv. 5, 14. They accu&s;ed him of rebellion again&s;t government, and of being the leader of a new &s;ect, who preferred Je&s;us of Nazareth above Mo&s;es, the great lawgiver to I&s;rael. This la&s;t charge he owns, and &s;o was a firm believer in revelation, while they rejected the coun&s;el of God again&s;t them&s;elves. And each heretic is &s;ubverted, and &s;inneth, being condemned of him&s;elf. Titus iii. 10, 11. For our Lord &s;ays, All things what&s;oever ye would that men &s;hould do to you, do ye even &s;o to them; for this is the law and the prophets. And each profe&s;&s;or who breaks this law of equity, and will not repent, is to be rejected by the church. And when &s;uch men form other communities, with other laws than the laws of Chri&s;t, it is a way which tries the hearts of all. Therefore the voice of in&s;piration &s;ays, If any man &s;eem to be contentious, we have no &s;uch cu&s;tom, neither the churches of God. Now in this that I declare unto you, I prai&s;e you not, that you come together not for the better, but for the wor&s;e. For fir&s;t of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divi&s;ions among you, and I partly believe it. For there mu&s;t al&s;o be here&s;ies among you, that they which are approved may be made manife&s;t among you. 1 Cor. xi. 16&mdash;19. Hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, &s;trife, &s;editions and here&s;ies, are all works of the fle&s;h. Gal. v. 20.
<PB N="333" REF="030011_0332_0FE3C29C2A968EB0">Now in all the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, here&s;y appears to mean rebellion again&s;t God in his church. And another apo&s;tle &s;ays of them who loved the world above God, They went out from us; but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us; but they went out, that they might be made manife&s;t, that they were not all of us. And this is the &s;pirit of antichri&s;t. 1 John ii. 15&mdash;19. All religious communities wherein the love of the world prevails above the love of God, are chargeable with damnable here&s;ies.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. In monarchical governments the power is in a few hands, but in America all power of govern|ment is derived from the people, who have a fair opportunity to know teachers by their fruits. And where is the man who cannot di&s;tingui&s;h thorns and brambles from trees which bear good fruit? Luke vi. 44, 45. Our Lord here plainly refers us to a parable concerning the fir&s;t man who &s;et him&s;elf up as king of the church of I&s;rael, when God was their only king. All the good trees refu&s;ed any &s;uch power over other trees, but the bramble &s;aid, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, then come and put your tru&s;t in my &s;hadow; and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon. Judges ix. 8&mdash;15. The tongue &s;etteth on fire the cour&s;e of nature, and it is &s;et on fire of hell. James iii. 6. And &s;uch men would de&s;troy the be&s;t characters in the land, if they would not yield to their darling &s;chemes. But no man &s;hould ever be elected into office, who hath not been found to be a good tree by his fruits in private &s;tations; and all teachers &s;hould be avoided, as wolves in &s;heep's clothing, who tare away the property of any unju&s;tly. And it is impo&s;&s;ible for any community to be clear of this evil, where religious teachers are &s;upported by force. For as the church of I&s;rael were never allowed to do it, when they came into that
<PB N="334" REF="030011_0333_0FE3BB41EE2FFD68">practice, God &s;aid, Her princes within her are roar|ing lions, her judges are evening wolves, they gnaw not the bones till the morrow. Her prophets are light and treacherous per&s;ons, her prie&s;ts have pol|luted the &s;anctuary, they have done violence to the law. Zeph. iii. 3, 4. And all the natural lions and wolves in the world, never de&s;troyed &s;o many men, as national churches have done in our day. Again it was &s;aid of I&s;rael, The heads thereof judge for re|ward, and the prie&s;ts thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money; yet will they lean upon the Lord, and &s;ay, Is not the Lord among us? none evil can come upon us. But for the&s;e iniquities their nation was ruined, and the mountain of the hou&s;e of God will be exalted above all earthly powers, when wars &s;hall come to an end. Micah iii. 11, 12. iv. 1&mdash;5. Is not the Lord among us? none evil can come upon us, was the language which brought ruin upon Jeru&s;alem, and &s;uch confidence in negatives will ruin all people who build thereon. For rea&s;on as well as &s;cripture di&s;covers, that the more light men have, the greater is their guilt and mi&s;ery if they &s;in again&s;t it. But when the knowl|edge of the Lord &s;hall cover the earth as the waters cover the &s;ea, the wolf &s;hall dwell with the lamb, and they &s;hall not hurt nor de&s;troy in all his holy moun|tain. I&s;aiah xi. 6&mdash;9. And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent. John xvii. 3. This is the only way of peace and eternal happine&s;s.</P>
