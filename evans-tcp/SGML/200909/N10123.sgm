<HEAD>An Attempt to &s;hew, That <HI>the Ancients</HI> mu&s;t have the Know|ledge of <HI>the We&s;tern World,</HI> or <HI>America.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is well known, that, in the Year of our Lord 1492, <HI>Chri&s;topher Columbus,</HI> of <HI>Genoa,</HI> di&s;covered the I&s;lands of <HI>Hi&s;paniola, Cuba</HI> and <HI>Jamaica;</HI> and that <HI>Americus Ve&s;putius</HI> of <HI>Florence,</HI> under the Direction and Encouragement of <HI>Emanuel,</HI> King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> in the Year 1497, di&s;covered the Continent of <HI>America,</HI> which has been &s;o called from that Time after his Name.</P>
<P>Now many have imagined, and even &s;ome of the Learned among them, that this <HI>We&s;tern World</HI> was never known before the&s;e Di&s;coveries of the <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> and <HI>Florentine</HI> Commanders.&mdash;Thus the learned <HI>Pan|ciroll</HI> in particular &s;ees fit to reckon the <HI>New World,</HI> or <HI>America,</HI> among the Things, which were <HI>unknown to</HI> the Ancients. <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Parcirollus, De Novo Orbe. Lib. 2. Tit. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Americus Ve&s;putius</HI> too, in his Epi&s;tle to <HI>Renatus,</HI> King of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> and <HI>Sicily,</HI> and Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> and <HI>Barre,</HI> writes, as follows, <HI>We believe, that, as our Ance&s;tors make no mention of the I&s;lands and firm Lands of</HI> America; <HI>&s;o the</HI> Ancients them&s;elves <HI>had no know|ledge of them.</HI>&mdash;And the Publi&s;her of this Epi&s;tle, to|gether with a Number of Tracts wrote by ancient
<PB N="6" REF="012861_0005_0F8B94423AC618C8">
Voyagers, <HI>Seba&s;tian Mun&s;ter,</HI> ob&s;erves, that <HI>Chri&s;topher Columbus</HI> and <HI>Albericus</HI> [for &s;o he writes it] <HI>Ve&s;putius</HI> were the fir&s;t of Mortals, who found out <HI>America,</HI> and other unknown Lands.</P>
<P>However, the learned <HI>Keckerman,</HI> having well con|&s;idered, whether <HI>America</HI> was known to the Ancients or no, and weighed the mo&s;t probable Arguments on both Sides of this Que&s;tion, has plainly given his Judg|ment in Favour of <HI>it's being known to</HI> them.</P>
<P>But, if this Matter be examined with Judgment, and with proper Care and Accuracy, we &s;hall find Rea&s;on to believe, that this <HI>large Part of the World was really known to</HI> the Ancients; and perhaps we &s;hall &s;ee much more Rea&s;on to believe it, than mo&s;t Men imagine, and even many of the Learned them&s;elves can pro|duce in oppo&s;ition to it.</P>
<P>We &s;hall take Leave to relate here; though we &s;hall not lay any great Stre&s;s on the Relation, as it may be called a too modern one; That, in the Reign of <HI>Henry the Second,</HI> and in the Year 1170, which was 300 Years before <HI>Columbus,</HI> One <HI>Madoc ap Owen Gwineth,</HI> not only di&s;covered <HI>South America,</HI> but &s;et|tled in &s;ome Part of <HI>Mexico,</HI> and left Monuments <HI>there</HI> both of <HI>the Briti&s;h Language and Briti&s;h U&s;ages:</HI> Of which <HI>the Spaniards</HI> have taken Notice; and &s;everal <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> Writers, and other <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Authors be&s;ides, have credited and confirmed the Relation.&mdash;How this hone&s;t <HI>Madoc</HI> came to take it into his Head to vi&s;it <HI>South America,</HI> we know not. However we think it not ir|rational to &s;uppo&s;e, that, previou&s;ly to his going <HI>there,</HI> he might have had &s;ome Account of the Country, and the Way of getting at it.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o another &s;till more modern Account, than that of hone&s;t <HI>Madoc</HI>'s, concerning the Di&s;covery of <HI>America;</HI> which, although it be a little more mo|dern,
<PB N="7" REF="012861_0006_0F8B944360411098">
it may not be ami&s;s to offer. This may be found in <HI>Ortelius</HI>'s <HI>Theatre,</HI> as follows: <HI>The Northem Part of</HI> the New World, <HI>which is e&s;pecially extended towards</HI> Europe, Groenland, I&s;eland and Frie&s;land; <HI>and is named</HI> E&s;totiland <HI>by &s;ome Fi&s;hermen of the I&s;land of</HI> Frie&s;land, <HI>who were driven by a Tempe&s;t to the&s;e Shores: This,</HI> being of old viewed and ob&s;erved, <HI>about this Year, that is the Year of our LORD</HI> 1340, Nic|olas and Antony Zenus, <HI>Brethren, noble</HI> Venetians, <HI>under the Au&s;pices of</HI> Zichmi, <HI>called King of</HI> Frie&s;land, <HI>again recognized and brought to Knowledge.</HI> And <HI>John Skoluo,</HI> a Polonian, in 1456, &s;ailed to this Country. If any &s;hould a&s;k, what Place this <HI>E&s;totiland</HI> is? I can only an&s;wer, that &s;ome Geographers take it to be <HI>New-foundland,</HI> or <HI>Cape Breton:</HI> But others think it to be <HI>New Britain,</HI> and the Land of <HI>Labrador.</HI> However it is agreed by all, that it was a Part of <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>But, in&s;tead of taking up Time about the&s;e or any more modern Relations, we &s;hall go back to <HI>more ancient Times and Things,</HI> which have Relation to <HI>this We&s;tern World.</HI></P>
<P>It is remarked by a learned Spani&s;h Writer, <HI>Villal|pandus,</HI> that his Fellow-Citizen of <HI>Corduba, L. Annaeus Seneca,</HI> who was Nephew to that famous <HI>Seneca,</HI> the Tutor of the Brute <HI>Nero; when the Form of the World did not yet appear to be known, yet foretold, that another World &s;hould be found out:</HI> <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Villalpand.</HI> De Magin Divinatrice, Lib. 1. cap. 4. p. 7.</NOTE> It is true this <HI>L. Annaeus Seneca,</HI> in one of his <HI>Dramatic</HI> Pieces, &s;ays, that <HI>in late Years Ages &s;hall come, in which Ocean &s;hall loo&s;e the Bonds of Things,</HI> and <HI>the mighty Earth &s;hall be laid open, and</HI> Thyphis <HI>&s;hall di&s;cover</HI> new Worlds. <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>&mdash;Venient Annis</L>

<PB N="8" REF="012861_0007_0F8B9443D8AFF240">
But although <HI>Seneca</HI>'s Town&s;man hence affirms, that he <HI>foretold another World &s;hould be found out;</HI> we need not be &s;o unrea&s;onably credulous as to believe, that, when he wrote in this Manner, he was <HI>in&s;pired with the Spirit of Prophecy:</HI> No! For nothing of this Sort appears. It is much more likely, that, either from &s;ome faint Apprehen&s;ion of the Structure of the <HI>Terraqueous Globe,</HI> or from &s;ome <HI>traditional Accounts of the Greatne&s;s of the Earth,</HI> and <HI>of another World</HI> be&s;ides their old one, he might write after this <HI>&s;eem|ingly Prophetical</HI> Manner.&mdash;But, if any think, that what he has thus written &s;hould be taken only for <HI>Poetical Fiction,</HI> or fanciful Prophecy, we &s;hall be con|tented: For we do not build much upon it.</P>
<P>But there is an <HI>Hi&s;torical</HI> Pa&s;&s;age handed to us by <HI>Pomponius Mela,</HI> who lived in the Emperour <HI>Clau|dius</HI>'s Time, about the Year of our Lord 93; which, as it is remarkable, is de&s;erving both of a particular Recital and an attentive Con&s;ideration: It is as fol|lows;&mdash;When <HI>Metellus Celer,</HI> who by the Way was called <HI>Celer</HI> for his Quickne&s;s in preparing to celebrate the <HI>Funeral Ob&s;equies</HI> of his Father, was <HI>Procon&s;ul</HI> a|mong <HI>the Gauls,</HI> he received as a Pre&s;ent <HI>certain In|dians</HI> <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pompon. Mela.</HI> Lib. 3.</NOTE> from the King of the <HI>Suevians;</HI> who, being &s;natched away by the Force of Storms from <HI>the Indian Shores, at length came out</HI> to the Shores of <HI>Germany.</HI>&mdash; The&s;e are the Words of the Hi&s;torian: And this Hi&s;tory, as <HI>Vadianus</HI> the Commentator on <HI>Pomponius</HI> ob&s;erves, fairly <HI>indicates, that there is a Sea which may be navigated in the mo&s;t di&s;tant Tracts.</HI> <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vadian.</HI> Note in <HI>Pompon.</HI> p. 13:</NOTE></P>
<P>Now, from this Hi&s;torical Account, it &s;eems proba|ble, that <HI>the&s;e Indians</HI> might be carried away from the Coa&s;t of <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> or <HI>Labrador,</HI> or &s;ome other Place to the Northward, by a violent Gale of Wind of long Continuance with them, until at length they
<PB N="9" REF="012861_0008_0F8B9448F1F8A9E0">
arrived on <HI>the German Coa&s;t,</HI> and got a Shore there.&mdash; And the coming of the&s;e Indians might very well con|vince and &s;atisfie both the King of <HI>the Suevians</HI> with his People; and the <HI>Roman Procon&s;ul,</HI> and from him the <HI>whole Roman Empire,</HI> that there was <HI>another World,</HI> be&s;ides <HI>That</HI> inhabited by them&s;elves.</P>
<P>There was al&s;o in mo&s;t ancient Times repeated Mention made of two I&s;lands called <HI>Atlantides,</HI> which were &s;aid to have been about 10,000 Stadia di&s;tant from <HI>Libya: There</HI> were <HI>the Ely&s;ian Fields and the Dwellings of the Ble&s;&s;ed,</HI> mentioned by <HI>Homer, Horace,</HI> and other Poets. The&s;e I&s;lands &s;eem to be called by <HI>Pliny</HI> the <HI>He&s;perides:</HI> For he reckons two in the <HI>At|lantic</HI> Sea: and <HI>the&s;e,</HI> as he &s;ays, beyond <HI>the Gorgons</HI> in a Navigation for 40 Days beyond <HI>the Atlantis.</HI>&mdash; Now the learned Geographer <HI>Ortelius</HI> &s;uppo&s;es it pro|bable, that <HI>the&s;e</HI> might be the I&s;lands of <HI>Hi&s;paniola</HI> and <HI>Cuba.</HI>&mdash;But <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> tells us, that <HI>the Atlan|tides,</HI> or the People of tho&s;e I&s;lands, <HI>as we have re|ceived, are inhabiting Places near to the Ocean, and very happy indeed.</HI> <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Diodor. Sicul.</HI> De fabulo&s;is Antiquorum <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">. p. 261.</NOTE> And in Truth, if we &s;uppo&s;e, with <HI>Ortelius,</HI> the&s;e I&s;lands to be the &s;ame with <HI>Hi&s;pa|niola</HI> and <HI>Cuba,</HI> they mu&s;t be <HI>near the Ocean</HI> indeed, as <HI>Diodorus</HI> &s;ays: For they are &s;urrounded with it.</P>
<P>But <HI>Plato,</HI> who lived about 400 Years before our Saviour's Time, has given us the mo&s;t particular and full Account of <HI>the Atlantic I&s;land,</HI> as it is called by him, in one and another of his Compo&s;itions: And we &s;hall endeavour, in as clear and conci&s;e a Manner as we can, to give his Account from the Edition of his Works publi&s;hed by <HI>Serranus.</HI>&mdash;In one of his Di|alogues, he &s;ays, that <HI>Neptune</HI> had by Lot <HI>the At|lantic I&s;land,</HI> and placed the Children he had by a mortal Woman in a certain Place of that I&s;land.&mdash;It received, he &s;ays, its Name from its fir&s;t King and
<PB N="10" REF="012861_0009_0F8B944B2D1AE3E8">
Lord, even from <HI>Atlas;</HI> and further adds, that the extreme Part of <HI>this I&s;land,</HI> which he had for his Lot, was at <HI>Hercules</HI>'s <HI>Pillars.</HI> <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Platonis</HI> Critias.</NOTE>&mdash;And, in another of his Writings, <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">In Timaeo.</NOTE> the following Pa&s;&s;ages may be found: In tho&s;e fir&s;t Times <HI>the Atlantic was a mo&s;t broad I&s;land;</HI> and there were extant mo&s;t powerful Kings in it; who, with joint Forces, appointed to occupy <HI>A&s;ia and Europe:</HI> And &s;o a mo&s;t grievous War was carried on: In which <HI>the Athenians,</HI> with the common Con&s;ent of <HI>the Greeks,</HI> oppo&s;ed them&s;elves; and they became the Conquerors.&mdash;But <HI>that Atlantic I&s;land</HI> by a Flood and Earthquake was indeed &s;uddenly de&s;troy|ed; and &s;o that Sort of warlike Men was ab&s;orped. N. B. The&s;e Things &s;eem to be related with Hi&s;torical Truth.&mdash;And he writes further plainly and expre&s;ly, that <HI>That Atlantic I&s;land, being in Truth overwhelmed with the Waves of the Sea, altogether di&s;appeared:</HI> And <HI>hence that Sea is difficult to be pa&s;&s;ed; ina&s;much as copious Clay yet remained from the Reliques of</HI> that I&s;land.&mdash;Moreover, he &s;ays, that&mdash;<HI>an I&s;land, in the Mouth of the Sea, and in the Pa&s;&s;age to tho&s;e Straits called the Pillars of</HI> Hercules, <HI>did exi&s;t; and that I&s;land was greater and larger than</HI> Lybia and A&s;ia; <HI>from which there was an ea&s;y Pa&s;&s;age over to other I&s;lands; and from tho&s;e I&s;lands al&s;o to</HI> that Continent, <HI>which is &s;ituated out of that Region,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Plato</HI> is not &s;ingular in this Narration: For both <HI>Strabo</HI> <NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Strabo.</HI> Lib. 2.</NOTE> and <HI>Pliny</HI> <NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Plin.</HI> Lib. 2. Cap. 32.</NOTE> have mentioned this <HI>Atlantic I&s;land;</HI> and &s;ay, that <HI>it was of old in the</HI> Atlantic Sea.</P>
<P>But as <HI>Plato</HI> &s;ays, that this <HI>greate&s;t I&s;land of the We&s;tern Ocean</HI> was lo&s;t; it is probably conjectured, that it was &s;ituated between the <HI>Azores and Canaries,</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="012861_0010_0F8B944B598A77A8">
as they are called: And, that <HI>The&s;e</HI> were form'd, and remain, out of the Reliques of it, <HI>Becman</HI> thought; and he believed, as he &s;ays, that it might be lengthily demon&s;trated.<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Becman.</HI> Hi&s;t. In&s;ul. c. 5.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Hoffman</HI> has truly ob&s;erved, that the <HI>Atlantis</HI> of <HI>Plato</HI> is to many <HI>America:</HI> And the learned <HI>Bochart</HI><NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bochart.</HI> Geograph. Sacr. p. 716.</NOTE>
appears to have been of the &s;ame Mind. And indeed, if this I&s;land was larger than <HI>Libya and A&s;ia,</HI> as <HI>Plato</HI> has acquainted us, it looks as if it were really <HI>America,</HI> or reaching &s;o far as to be clo&s;ely connected with it.</P>
<P>There &s;eems al&s;o Rea&s;on to think, that there mu&s;t have been in ancient Times &s;ome Knowlege of the <HI>American</HI> Regions: Becau&s;e we have credible Accounts of the Pa&s;&s;ages of Ve&s;&s;els through <HI>the Atlantis Ocean</HI> both one Way and the other:&mdash;We &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t on <HI>Pomponius Mela</HI>'s Account of one <HI>Endoxus;</HI> who &s;ays, <HI>in the Days of our Grandfathers,</HI> [and, as we noted before, he lived in the Time of the Emperor <HI>Claudius] when he fled from the King of Alexandria, Latyrus, he went forth from the</HI> Arabic Gulph <HI>thro' this Sea,</HI> as <HI>Nepos</HI> affirms, <HI>Gades u&s;que pervectus e&s;t,</HI> and was carried even to <HI>Cales.</HI> <NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pempon.

<P>But we ought to take &s;ome re&s;pectful Notice of <HI>Hanno,</HI> the famous <HI>Cathaginian,</HI> who wrote <HI>Periplum;</HI> in which we have a Relation of the Voyage pro&s;ecu|ted by him around the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> and the Lands found by him in the <HI>Atlantic Ocean:</HI> This Relation was written by him in the <HI>Punic,</HI> or <HI>Phoenician,</HI> Tongue: But it was afterwards tran&s;lated into <HI>Greek,</HI> and it is &s;till extant, as <HI>Hoffman</HI> gives us to under&s;tand in his
<PB N="12" REF="012861_0011_0F8B944C1CA50DB8">
Lexicon at the Word <HI>Annon.</HI>&mdash;It has not been the Lot of the pre&s;ent Writer to meet with this <HI>Periplum</HI> yet; and therefore he can make none of his own Ob&s;erva|tions upon it.&mdash;But <HI>Coelius Rhodiginus</HI> has given us this more expre&s;s and particular Information of the <HI>Carthaginian's</HI> Voyage; that <HI>Hanno,</HI> <NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cael.

the Year of our Lord 136, the Account, which he gives of a Colloquy between <HI>Midas of Phrygia and Silenus:</HI> In which Colloquy, among other Things, <HI>Silenus</HI> gave Information to <HI>Midas,</HI> that <HI>Europe, A&s;ia and Libya</HI> are I&s;lands, and &s;urrounded with the Ocean; and that <HI>one Continent exi&s;ts without this World;</HI> and he affirmed, that its Magnitude was immen&s;e and in|finite. <NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Aelian.</HI> Variar.

<P>We have thus produced <HI>Authorities,</HI> and offered <HI>Rea&s;ons</HI> &s;ufficient to render it mo&s;t highly probable, that <HI>this We&s;tern World must be known to</HI> the Ancients.</P>
<P>But here it may be demanded, if this Continent was known in ancient Times, was it inhabited in tho&s;e Times; and <HI>when was it fir&s;t inhabited, and by whom?</HI> And we &s;hall endeavour to give &s;ome &s;uitable An&s;wer to the proper Enquiries.</P>
<P>Now it ought in all Rea&s;on to be thought, that, as <HI>America,</HI> upon the more modern Di&s;coveries of it and Acquaintance with it, was found to be well peopled, and even &s;tocked with Inhabitants, probably as much as <HI>A&s;ia, Africa and Europe;</HI> &s;urely it mu&s;t have been inhabited, not merely above <HI>five hundred</HI> years; but a|bove <HI>one, two, three and even four thou&s;and years ago:</HI> And indeed it was probably inhabited not long after <HI>the Di&s;per&s;ion of tho&s;e numerous Families,</HI> who were &s;e|parated in Con&s;equence of the unhappy Affair at Babel.</P>
<P>The learned <HI>Grotius</HI> conceived, that <HI>the Americans</HI> came out of <HI>Europe,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing from <HI>Norway</HI> into <HI>Iceland;</HI> thence by <HI>Frie&s;land</HI> into <HI>Greenland;</HI> and &s;o into <HI>Esto|tiland,</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="012861_0013_0F8B944DB7D7F1B8">
which is probably a Part of the <HI>Western Conti|nent.</HI> <NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Grotius</HI> De Origine Gent. Americanar.</NOTE> And we mo&s;t acknowlege, that the pa&s;&s;ing out of <HI>Europe</HI> into <HI>America</HI> by this Routte is po&s;&s;ible and not unnatural: However it does not appear &s;o likely, that <HI>America</HI> was, fir&s;t of all, &s;ettled in this Manner.</P>
<P>But we are rather mo&s;t inclined to think, that <HI>the primary Americans</HI> were the De&s;cendants of <HI>Magog</HI> from <HI>Japhet.</HI> And, when we &s;ay <HI>the primary Ameri|cans,</HI> we mean <HI>after the Flood:</HI> For there is Rea&s;on to believe, that the People, who re&s;ided in the <HI>We&s;tern World,</HI> as well as the other Continent, were &s;wept a|way from the Face of the Earth; becau&s;e <HI>all Fle&s;h had corrupted their Way.</HI> Both <HI>Jo&s;eph Acosta</HI> and <HI>Antony Herrera</HI> acquaint us, that they found <HI>the Me|mory of the Flood</HI> pre&s;erved among the Indians of <HI>Cuba</HI> and <HI>Mechoachan</HI> and <HI>Nicaragua:</HI> And <HI>Coraca</HI> tells us, that, among <HI>the Peruvians,</HI> there was a Tra|dition, that <HI>all their Lands were plunged and laid hid in the Waters.</HI>&mdash;And if we mi&s;take not, all the Evi|dences <HI>in the natural World,</HI> which are commonly brought on the other Side of the Water to prove the <HI>general Inundation</HI> over that Continent, may be fairly produced to prove the general Prevalence of it over this Continent.</P>
<P>But, as we are now treating of the <HI>primary Inhabi|tants of America</HI> after the Flood; &s;o we &s;ay, that <HI>The&s;e</HI> appear to have de&s;cended from <HI>Japhet.</HI> As GOD, or ELONIM, as it is in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Text, i. e. the <HI>Covenanting Ones,</HI> or <HI>the Interpo&s;ers by Oath,</HI> had pro|mi&s;ed <HI>to enlarge Japhet;</HI> in which Promi&s;e there is a plain Allu&s;ion to his Name, as indeed there is a like Allu&s;ion to <HI>Names</HI> very frequently to be found in the Holy Scriptures; &s;o this Promi&s;e was mo&s;t remarkably fulfilled: For there fell to <HI>Japhet</HI>'s Share, not only all <HI>Europe,</HI> &s;o full of People, and <HI>A&s;ia the le&s;s</HI> and <HI>Media</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="012861_0014_0F8B944E38B40590">
and Part of <HI>Armenia</HI> and <HI>Iberia</HI> and <HI>Albania;</HI> but al&s;o all tho&s;e <HI>va&s;t Northern Regions,</HI> inhabited once by the <HI>Scythians,</HI> who de&s;cended from <HI>Magog,</HI> one of the Sons of <HI>Japhet,</HI> as he is &s;aid to be in Gen. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">. 2. And pro|bably <HI>this Western World,</HI> and that to a con&s;iderable Degree, came to his Share: For it is mo&s;t likely, that <HI>This</HI> was at fir&s;t much peopled by the <HI>Scythians: The&s;e,</HI> originally from <HI>Magog,</HI> were afterwards called <HI>Tartars;</HI> and &s;o called, as &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e, from the Name of the River <HI>Tartar</HI> or <HI>Tatar.</HI></P>
<P>As We find that <HI>the Earth was divided in the Days of</HI> Peleg; &s;o we read, in Gen. ix. 19, that as there were <HI>three Sons of</HI> Noah; &s;o <HI>of</HI> or <HI>from them the whole Earth was over&s;pread or &s;cattered.</HI> Nor is there any Rea&s;on to doubt, but that this Scattering was according to the direction of <HI>Noah,</HI> and from a Divine Warrant given him for this purpo&s;e: So then the Po&s;terity of <HI>Japhet,</HI> by <HI>Magog,</HI> according to the Will of Heaven, took the primary Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this <HI>new World:</HI> And <HI>how great|ly,</HI> how amazingly, was <HI>Japhet enlarged</HI> by this va&s;t Acqui&s;ition?</P>
<P>But, after <HI>this fir&s;t di&s;per&s;ion</HI> to the <HI>We&s;tern World,</HI> we readily grant, that there might be <HI>various Removals</HI> to it from various Nations: For after the <HI>Scythians</HI> or <HI>Tartars,</HI> were &s;ettled here; the <HI>Norwegians</HI> and <HI>Ice|landers</HI> might come; and &s;o might &s;ome of the <HI>Sinen|&s;ians</HI> from the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>But &s;ome perhaps may &s;ay here, <HI>And how came they to this &s;eparate World?</HI> To which we an&s;wer, that there was no need at all of <HI>any Navigation</HI> for it: For it is apprehended by many, that the <HI>northern Part of</HI> A&s;ia <HI>may be joined to</HI> America; or if they be divided at all, it mu&s;t be by a very narrow Channel, which may be pa&s;&s;ed over ea&s;ily in Boats or Canoes; or perhaps, as it is frozen over for a great Part of the Year, they might have a Pa&s;&s;age acro&s;s on Foot. <HI>Laet</HI> judged it
<PB N="16" REF="012861_0015_0F8B945243F559F8">
mo&s;t probable, that it was by the <HI>Straits of</HI> Anian, that <HI>the Tartars</HI> in ancient Times pa&s;&s;ed out of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> into <HI>America.</HI> But it is beyond all doubt, that, from the <HI>northern Parts of</HI> Europe, there might be an ea&s;y pa&s;|&s;ing to America for at lea&s;t three Quarters of a Year on a Bridge of &s;ub&s;tantial Ice.</P>
<P>Thus it looks as if the <HI>Northern Parts</HI> of America were <HI>first</HI> of all occupied and improved; and the In|habitants of <HI>The&s;e</HI> might probably remove both to the <HI>Westward</HI> and to the <HI>Southward,</HI> as Occa&s;ion required.</P>
<P><HI>Herrera</HI> &s;ays, as quoted by <HI>Laet,</HI> <NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Laet.</HI> De&s;cript. <HI>Americ.</HI></NOTE> that the Inhabi|tants of the <HI>West Indies</HI> came hither <HI>by Land:</HI> Which may be true, if they be &s;uppo&s;ed to come from <HI>the Northern Parts of</HI> America. But, if he &s;uppo&s;ed them to come directly from <HI>Europe,</HI> it will be difficult to make it out. Nor can we find any Way for This, but by &s;uppo&s;ing <HI>the Atlantic Land,</HI> which <HI>Plato</HI> repre|&s;ents to be bigger than <HI>A&s;ia and Libya</HI> together, might fill the <HI>Atlantic Ocean,</HI> even to the <HI>American</HI> I&s;lands, if not beyond them: And, with this Allowance, <HI>Her|rera</HI>'s ob&s;ervation might be true.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides what has been already ob&s;erved about the <HI>peopling of the Western World,</HI> it may be remarked, for the prevention or removal of Mi&s;takes, that, as <HI>Strabo</HI> has ju&s;tly noted, there are many Places which were for|merly Sea, that are now dry Land; <NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Strabon.</HI> Geograph.

<P>We have no Rea&s;on to think, that, in ancient Times, there were any Removes from <HI>Africa</HI> to <HI>America:</HI> For it is &s;aid, according to the ingenious Dr. <HI>Grew,</HI> that <HI>all over</HI> America <HI>there are no Blacks, but only</HI> at <HI>Qua|veca.</HI>&mdash;And, if indeed there are any <HI>there;</HI> perhaps they are not originally from <HI>Africa;</HI> but from &s;ome Country in <HI>China</HI> under the <HI>Torrid Zone,</HI> where the People are of <HI>a black Complexion.</HI></P>
<P>Some have thought and &s;ugge&s;ted, but we think in|judiciou&s;ly, as <HI>John Lerius</HI> and others, that the <HI>Ame|ricans</HI> were originally <HI>Canaanites,</HI> de&s;cended from <HI>Ham,</HI> the Son of <HI>Noah;</HI> and the De&s;cendants of tho&s;e, whom <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> drove from their Seats in <HI>Canaan;</HI> who, being con&s;trained to &s;eek out new Regions, at length came and &s;at down on this Continent.</P>
<P>Here we &s;hall readily allow, that the <HI>Phoenicians,</HI> who were originally <HI>Canaanites,</HI> in the Days not much later than <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s, did &s;ail into <HI>Spain:</HI> And as Part of the&s;e di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed <HI>Canaanites</HI> fled thither, &s;o a Part of them went into <HI>Baeotia,</HI> and another Part into <HI>Af|rica:</HI> And <HI>Procopius</HI> informs us of the Pillar to be &s;een about <HI>Tangier,</HI> which had in&s;cribed on it, that they were <HI>of the Po&s;terity of tho&s;e, who fled from the Face of</HI> Jo&s;hua the Son of Nun, <HI>the Robber.</HI> And it is not

at all improbable, that, as the&s;e <HI>Phoenicians,</HI> or <HI>Canaan|ites,</HI> might mingle with <HI>Japhet</HI>'s Po&s;terity in <HI>Europe;</HI> &s;o &s;ome of them might in Proce&s;s of Time come to <HI>America</HI> by the Way of the Sea and &s;ettle here: For they were mightily for <HI>Navigation and Trade and Commerce.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;ome may a&s;k; <HI>Where learned They the Art of Navigation?</HI> And how came they to under&s;tand <HI>the U&s;e and Application of the Magnet?&mdash;Panormitan</HI> in|deed would have it, that <HI>Amalphis</HI> fir&s;t di&s;covered the <HI>U&s;e of the Load&s;tone</HI> to Mariners: And there is a Latin Line made to record the Di&s;coverer, <HI>Prima dedit Nautis u&s;um Magnetis</HI> Amalphis:&mdash;By which we are to under&s;tand an <HI>Italian City,</HI> where one <HI>John Goa,</HI> it is &s;aid, found out the U&s;e of <HI>the Mariner's Compa&s;s,</HI> a|bout the Year of our Lord 1302.&mdash;But the <HI>Phoenicians</HI> were generally thought to be <HI>the Inventers of the Ma|riner's Art;</HI> and, from <HI>The&s;e,</HI> the <HI>Greeks</HI> received it; and, of <HI>the&s;e,</HI> the <HI>Cretans</HI> fir&s;t of all, as <HI>Pliny</HI> acquaints us. But as the <HI>Phoenicians</HI> fir&s;t tried the Seas among the Nations at Hand, and then afar off; &s;o <HI>Thucydides</HI> tells us, that the <HI>Corinthians</HI> were the fir&s;t among the <HI>Greeks,</HI> who performed Voyages:&mdash;</P>

<P>The Voyage of <HI>Hanno,</HI> the <HI>Carthaginian,</HI> round the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> has already been mention'd: And &s;urely <HI>This</HI> mu&s;t di&s;cover <HI>no &s;mall Skill</HI> in Navigation.

<P>Thus it appears with &s;ufficient Probability, that <HI>Ame|rica</HI> not very long after the Flood was &s;ettled; and that, after the fir&s;t Settlement of it, there were &s;ucce&s;&s;ive

Removals to it, e&s;pecially from the <HI>Northern Parts of Europe and A&s;ia:</HI> And then, after &s;ome Ages had re|volved, the <HI>Phoenicians</HI> might arrive and trade and &s;ettle here.

<P>But &s;ome may be ready to enquire, <HI>Whether we have any Proofs from the</HI> &s;acred Writings, <HI>that this We&s;tern World was known to</HI> the Ancients? And <HI>what Evi|dences can be offered from them,</HI> to &s;hew that it was &s;o?</P>

<P>But, when we have better Proofs than merely human ones, it mu&s;t certainly be fit and right to give <HI>The&s;e</HI> the Preference.</P>
<P>Now the Evangeli&s;t <HI>Mark</HI> informs us, in Chap. xvi. 20. that <HI>They,</HI> the Apo&s;tles, <HI>went forth and preached</HI> every where, <HI>the LORD working with</HI> them, &amp;c. i. e. They went, and performed, according to the Divine Direction. And the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, in Colo&s;. i. 23. <HI>The Go&s;pel ye have heard, which was preached to</HI> every Creature, which is under Heaven, &amp;c. And as He lets us know, in Rom. i. 8. that <HI>the Faith of the</HI> Romans <HI>was publi&s;hed in</HI> all the World; &s;o He tells <HI>the Colo&s;&s;ians</HI> mo&s;t plainly and expre&s;ly, as in Col. i. 6. that <HI>the Word of Truth, the Go&s;pel, was come not only to them, but</HI> in all the World, <HI>and bringeth forth Fruit,</HI> &amp;c. And our Apo&s;tle tells us, in Rom. x. 18. that, according to the ancient Prophecy of them, i. e. the Apo&s;tles, <HI>their Sound went into</HI> all the Earth, <HI>and
<PB N="24" REF="012861_0023_0F8B945C7ABEB240">
their Words to</HI> the Ends of the World. And indeed, if one Apo&s;tle <HI>from</HI> Jeru&s;alem <HI>and round about even to</HI> Illyricum, <HI>fully preached the Go&s;pel of CHRIST,</HI> or <HI>filled up the Go&s;pel of CHRIST;</HI> &s;o that all the Places between <HI>Jeru&s;alem and Illyricum,</HI> and round about them, were <HI>fully go&s;pelized by Him,</HI> as in Rom. xv. 19; we may rea&s;onably think, that <HI>the rest of the Apo&s;tles</HI> with the <HI>Seventy Di&s;ciples, being alike indu&s;t|rious and faithful</HI> in the Work of the Lord, mu&s;t <HI>fully preach the Go&s;pel</HI> even throughout the whole World.</P>
<P>But, if we think further with <HI>Eu&s;ebius,</HI> that, be&s;ides the <HI>Twelve Apostles, and the Seventy Di&s;ciples; there were more Apostles and Di&s;ciples:</HI> Which he gathers from that Pa&s;&s;age of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> in 1 Corinth. xv. 6. <HI>After that, he was &s;een of</HI> above five hund|red Brethren <HI>at once; of whom</HI> the greater Part <HI>re|main unto this pre&s;ent; but &s;ome are fallen a&s;leep:</HI> <NOTE N="(w)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Eu&s;eb.</HI> Eccle&s;. Hi&s;t. Lib. 1. Cap. 13.</NOTE>
Then there mu&s;t be above <HI>two hundred and fifty Bre|thren,</HI> be&s;ides the <HI>twelve Apostles</HI> and <HI>the Seventy Di&s;|ciples,</HI> who had <HI>&s;een CHRIST,</HI> and could atte&s;t to the <HI>Truth and Certainty of his Re&s;urrection,</HI> and &s;o to the Divinity of his Religion: And a con&s;iderable Number of <HI>the&s;e</HI> might come to our <HI>Western World.</HI> And &s;o <HI>America</HI> mu&s;t have been filled up with the Go&s;pel, according to our Apo&s;tle's Expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Some indeed have in&s;i&s;ted on it, that the Pa&s;&s;ages con|cerning the <HI>Go&s;pel's coming in all the World, and going into all the Earth,</HI> and the like, only intend and mean the <HI>Roman Empire.</HI> But if they will wre&s;t <HI>the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages</HI> to this Sen&s;e; it &s;eems hard to force that Pa&s;&s;age in the Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Colo&s;&s;ians,</HI> above-cited, to that Meaning that <HI>the Go&s;pel was preached to every Creature,</HI> that is, to every Man <HI>under Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>We do not now therefore concern our&s;elves &s;o much <HI>Who were the bringers of the Go&s;pel to this</HI> American

World: But we think, that there is Rea&s;on to affirm from Divine Authority, that it <HI>was brought here by</HI> one or more of the Apo&s;tles and Di&s;ciples and many Brethren, <HI>and produced Fruit.</HI> And therefore this Con|tinent mu&s;t be certainly known to the&s;e <HI>first Preachers of the Go&s;pel</HI> in it: And from them, without Doubt the Faith of the <HI>Americans</HI> was publi&s;hed in all the other World.</P>
<P>There is then, alas! too much Rea&s;on to believe, that this <HI>Western World</HI> &s;inned away the Go&s;pel: And why &s;hould this be thought &s;trange and incredible with us; when <HI>Africa,</HI> which for &s;everal Hundreds of Years after our <HI>Saviour</HI>'s Time, was enlightned with the Go&s;pel and filled with Chri&s;tian Societies, is now involved gen|erally in Mahometan Glooms or Pagan Darkne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>But however we have good Grounds for hoping, that <HI>the Go&s;pel and Religion of Je&s;us</HI> will recover their lo&s;t Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and gain a more wide and exten&s;ive Spreading, than has yet been known in the later Ages and Generations: For it is foretold by the Spirit of Prophecy, in Habak. ii. 14. which we thus read ac|cording to the <HI>Original Hebrew, The Earth &s;hall be filled to know the Glory, JEHOVAH, as the Waters &s;hall cover upon the Sea.</HI></P>
<P>Now the LORD GOD ALMIGHTY grant, that <HI>this whole Continent,</HI> as well as the <HI>Old World,</HI> may find the fulle&s;t and mo&s;t perfect Accompli&s;hment of this <HI>good Word, on which He</HI> cau&s;es the Hearts of his People <HI>to hope</HI> and re&s;t: And may <HI>all the People</HI> of the World unite in &s;aying, AMEN.</P>

<P>IT may be proper and advi&s;eable to add a few Things here, by Way of <HI>Appendix,</HI> which could not be &s;o properly and conveniently introduced in the foregoing <HI>E&s;&s;ay.</HI> And indeed, as <HI>Divine Pro|vidence,</HI> without my &s;eeking for it, has furni&s;hed an <HI>Oc|ca&s;ion</HI> for mentioning &s;ome fit and right Things, with regard to the&s;e <HI>American Colonies, and &s;ome late Tran&s;|actions</HI> to their Di&s;advantage and Wrong; I cannot but think it my Duty to <HI>improve it;</HI> hoping, that none will be troubled or offended with me for &s;o doing. For why &s;hould any one be &s;o, for taking a fair Opportu|nity to &s;hew <HI>my Affection to my Country,</HI> as well as my <HI>Good Will and Regard to the Rest of the Colonies?</HI></P>
<P>Some have noted, and it is worthy of Ob&s;ervation, That <HI>Colonies,</HI> from the Beginning of Things, after the Flood, to this Day, have been almo&s;t con&s;tantly led
<PB N="27" REF="012861_0026_0F8B94622B120040">
forth <HI>from the East to the West,</HI> and not in the contra|ry Direction. And the mentioning of <HI>This</HI> brings to Memory a Remark, that was made by the worthy Mr. <HI>Jeremy White</HI> but a little while before he made his Ex|it out of the World. When he was a&s;ked, <HI>What he thought of the&s;e</HI> American Regions? After a little Pau&s;e he a&s;ked the Enquirer, <HI>Whence the wi&s;e Men came, who repaired to</HI> Judea, <HI>in order to &s;hew their Re&s;pect and pay their Homage to</HI> the glorious King of the World? To which Que&s;tion it was an&s;wered by the Gentleman, at who&s;e Hou&s;e he then was, <HI>Why, Sir, from the Ea&s;t:</HI> Whereupon Mr. <HI>White</HI> remarked, <HI>And let me tell You, Sir, They have been travelling</HI> We&s;tward <HI>ever &s;ince:</HI> And then he went on and gave it as his Judgment, that this Part of the World <HI>&s;eemed to him to be re&s;erved in Providence for the</HI> great Seat of Empire and Religi|on and the Theatre of con&s;iderable Events before the End of the World.</P>
<P>In the publi&s;hed Account, concerning <HI>the Life</HI> of this learned and pious Gentleman, it is related, that, al|though he lived to be near 80 Years of Age, <HI>He nei|ther &s;urvived his Rea&s;on, his Chearfulne&s;s, his Memory, nor his Honour:</HI> And we may fitly add here, that the Remark above-mentioned, made by him towards the Clo&s;e of his Life, &s;hewed not only <HI>the Penetration of his Mind,</HI> but <HI>the Soundne&s;s of his Judgment al&s;o:</HI> And, as <HI>Cicero</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Dies&mdash;Naturae Judicia confirmat;</HI> which we may render, <HI>Time confirms the Judgments of Nature,</HI> or the Judgments formed from the Ob&s;ervation of Nature.</P>
<P>And now Things are tending apace towards the Completion of Mr. <HI>White</HI>'s Sentiments and Expectati|ons; and, as we apprehend, to the Fulfilment of &s;un|dry Predictions in <HI>the more &s;ure Word of Prophecy</HI> con|cerning the Prevalence of the Redeemer's Kingdom <HI>in the West and to the Goings down of the Sun,</HI> and <HI>the filling of the Whole Earth with his Glory.</HI></P>

to be &s;o much <HI>Malevolence and Enmity</HI> manife&s;ted to|wards the <HI>natural and constitutional Rights and Liber|ties</HI> of the <HI>Americans,</HI> as cannot well admit of any ju&s;t Apology, or fair Excu&s;e.</P>
<P>We have no Inclination to concern our&s;elves &s;o far as to treat largely concerning <HI>the Legi&s;lative Authority of</HI> Great Britain. Let This be called <HI>Supreme</HI> by its Favourers; and let it be magnified in all other Re|gards and to the uttermo&s;t Degree by them, if they plea&s;e: But, with their Leave, <HI>it is not extended, nor can it</HI> con&s;titutionally <HI>be,</HI> to the Affair of <HI>Taxation,</HI> as all <HI>Britons</HI> know, or might know if they would: For <HI>the Commons</HI> of Great Britain have <HI>the &s;ole Right of taxing the People,</HI> whom they repre&s;ent: <HI>This Right</HI> was recovered upon the <HI>Revolution:</HI> And, ever &s;ince that Time, <HI>the Commons</HI> have &s;teadily exerci&s;ed it. It is allowed, that, as <HI>Tax Bills</HI> are &s;ent up to <HI>the Lords and Crown, They accept of them,</HI> ju&s;t as they are brought to them, according to the Formality of Law: For otherwi&s;e the Monies granted cannot be had, and ap|plied to the public U&s;e and Service.&mdash;But, after all, <HI>the Taxation it&s;elf, and the Gift of the Monies,</HI> is by <HI>the Commons,</HI> in the Name and Behalf of the People of <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>Now <HI>the Americans,</HI> and <HI>their Commons,</HI> as Judge <HI>Black&s;tone</HI> calls our <HI>General A&s;&s;emblies,</HI> cannot &s;ee, <HI>what Right the</HI> Commons <HI>of</HI> Britain <HI>have to take their Mo|nies</HI> from them, and apply them to &s;uch U&s;es as they judge proper. Nay they have over and over again unan&s;werably proved, that they <HI>have not the Right to</HI> do &s;o: For indeed, if they have it, certainly we poor <HI>Americans</HI> mu&s;t be <HI>de&s;titute of the Rights and Privi|leges of</HI> Engli&s;hmen, to which we are fully entitled: And, if <HI>This</HI> be our Ca&s;e, it mu&s;t be di&s;reputable and ignominious both <HI>to them and their American Brethren: To them,</HI> that they deprive us of the Rights and Liber|ties ju&s;tly belonging to us; and to their <HI>American Bre|thren,</HI>

who have dearly purcha&s;ed them, and never have yet forfeited them; but have rather de&s;erved an Addition to them by our Exertions.</P>
<P>And yet <HI>the Majority</HI> of a certain great A&s;&s;embly have peremptorily re&s;olved, that <HI>They have Authority to make Laws binding on the Colonies</HI> in all Ca&s;es what|&s;oever: So then They thus a&s;&s;ert their Authority, a|mong other Things, <HI>to tax us when, and how, and as often and as much as they plea&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Upon which, if it &s;hould be enquired, <HI>By what Au|thority they</HI> thus <HI>re&s;olved? And who gave them that Authority?</HI> It is probable, that they could give no &s;ufficient and &s;atisfactory An&s;wer. Certainly the <HI>Ame|ricans</HI> never gave them &s;uch Authority; and the Peo|ple of <HI>Britain</HI> never could give them &s;uch Authority: For they never had it to give.</P>
<P>But it de&s;erves &s;ome particular Notice here, that they were &s;o cautious and re&s;erved as not to &s;ay, that <HI>they had the Right,</HI> or <HI>rightful Authority, to make &s;uch Laws:</HI> And hence it may very fitly be pre&s;umed, that they <HI>knew in their own Souls, that they had no &s;uch Right, or rightful Authority;</HI> and therefore they would not declare, that it belonged to them.</P>
<P>Many judicious Per&s;ons here are of the Mind, and have often expre&s;&s;ed it, that it would have been better if the Majority had not boa&s;ted of their <HI>ab&s;olute Au|thority, nor indeed re&s;olved any Thing at all about</HI> it: For, in Truth, <HI>the Saying and Re&s;olving,</HI> that <HI>they have &s;uch Authority, is no Proof at all</HI> of their being in the rightful Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it.&mdash;And <HI>the Methods,</HI> which have been taken for &s;upporting their <HI>a&s;&s;erted Authority,</HI> have no Tendency to produce <HI>any Approbation of it, or real Regard to it.</HI> But, as <HI>the Claim</HI> of &s;uch an Authority by a <HI>Briti&s;h Senate</HI> mu&s;t be deemed ab&s;urd and wrong by the mo&s;t under&s;tanding <HI>Britons them|&s;elves;</HI>

&s;o <HI>the rough Managements</HI> to &s;upport and e|&s;tabli&s;h <HI>it</HI> are judged, by <HI>the Americans</HI> in general, to be contrary to Rea&s;on, Right and Equity.&mdash;And <HI>all the Military Force,</HI> which can be &s;ent for its Support, will only &s;erve to confirm and e&s;tabli&s;h the&s;e Colonies in their real Apprehen&s;ions, that <HI>wrong and unrighte|ous,</HI> as well <HI>as weak and fooli&s;h, Mea&s;ures</HI> are u&s;ed with them; and <HI>The&s;e,</HI> as they think, from &s;uch <HI>illiberal Motives,</HI> as wi&s;e Men will find it very difficult to ju&s;ti|fie, or even to palliate.</P>
<P>Although it has been readily and cheerfully granted, that <HI>the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons have the undoubted Right and &s;ole Power and Authority of</HI> taxing the Peo|ple, their Brethren, at Home; yet we conceive it to be a mo&s;t <HI>unrea&s;onable and unrighteous Stretch of the Authority,</HI> which is claimed by them, <HI>to exerci&s;e it in taxing the People of</HI> America:&mdash;For it is mo&s;t &s;ure and certain, that <HI>the Americans</HI> have never <HI>cho&s;en</HI> them for their Repre&s;entatives; and it is rea&s;onable to think, that they <HI>never will chu&s;e</HI> them as &s;uch: Becau&s;e they cannot well be accountable to them for their public Conduct and Managements; nor can they well be treated by them according to their good or evil De|&s;ervings from them.</P>

was all for the &s;ake of <HI>enjoying tho&s;e Rights and Privileges,</HI> which are now &s;candalou&s;ly begrutched to them, and in&s;idiou&s;ly and wrongfully wre&s;ted from them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Coloni&s;ts</HI> al&s;o think, that the Managements a|gain&s;t them are <HI>impolitic and imprudent,</HI> as well as <HI>di&s;|ingenuous and unfair:</HI> For, it <HI>New England alone,</HI> by Divine Providence favouring their Expedition again&s;t <HI>Loui&s;burgh</HI> in the Year 1745, <HI>gave Protection to</HI> Great Britain <HI>and Peace to</HI> Europe; is it not highly proba|ble, that <HI>they,</HI> with the <HI>other Colonies,</HI> both may and will be greatly &s;erviceable in future to their <HI>Mother Country,</HI> unle&s;s they be di&s;couraged and hindred from being &s;o by unkind and injurious Treatment?

<P>Be&s;ides, The <HI>Americans</HI> &s;incerely think, that <HI>the Im|po&s;ition and Continuance of &s;uch Burdens</HI> on them is a direct and continued <HI>Breach of the public Faith:</HI> For the <HI>Americans,</HI> e&s;pecially of <HI>the Charter Governments, were &s;olemnly promi&s;ed, that they and their Po&s;terity forever &s;hould enjoy all the Rights and Privileges of Engli&s;hmen;</HI> upon Condition, that, at their own Ex|pence, they would &s;ettle and improve &s;uch and &s;uch Territories, as &s;hould be purcha&s;ed by them in <HI>America.</HI> Now it is beyond all Di&s;pute, that the <HI>Americans</HI> have fulfilled their Part of the Contract: And therefore <HI>the depriving of them</HI> of the &s;tipulated Rights and Liberties, and even the <HI>Abridgment of the&s;e,</HI> &s;hould not be me|ditated, and much le&s;s re&s;olved on and executed, <HI>by Chri&s;tianized Britons:</HI> For even <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Pagans</HI> would be a&s;hamed to perpetrate &s;uch a &s;hameful <HI>Breach of public Faith:</HI> And therefore it may be well and rea&s;onably expected, that, wherein there has been <HI>any
<PB N="33" REF="012861_0032_0F8B946B363E5658">
&s;uch Thing,</HI> or <HI>an Appearance of it,</HI> there &s;hould be an hone&s;t and manly Re&s;olution not to abide by it: For &s;uch a Re&s;olution, in&s;tead of di&s;honouring any Body of Men, would render them more amiable, excellent and illu&s;trious in the E&s;timation of the whole World.</P>
<P>Moreover; The Coloni&s;ts judge, that <HI>the Briti&s;h Commons</HI> have dealt with them, in their modern Ma|nagements, not according to the <HI>golden Rule of Equity:</HI> For certainly <HI>the Briti&s;h Commons,</HI> were <HI>They in</HI> our <HI>Situation and Circum&s;tances,</HI> and We in theirs, <HI>would not think it ju&s;t and right for them&s;elves to receive &s;uch Treatment</HI> from us, as they judge proper to give unto us.</P>
<P>The <HI>Americans</HI> therefore, upon &s;uch Con&s;iderations as have been mentioned, are ready to exclaim with regard to the unfit, unkind and injurious Dealings to|wards them by their Brethren: <HI>Oh! the Times! Oh! the Manners!</HI> For they think it wrong, that any Men &s;hould exert, if they have it, &s;uch an undue Influence as <HI>to remove the ancient Landmarks</HI> of Engli&s;h Freedom, as well as of Truth and Righteou&s;ne&s;s: And they look on it as unaccountable and a&s;toni&s;hing, that any &s;uch Things &s;hould be <HI>acted,</HI> or <HI>tamely &s;uffered,</HI> by <HI>Great Britain.</HI> Yea the <HI>Coloni&s;ts</HI> &s;cruple not to &s;peak out the Language of the <HI>Tragic Poet</HI> in the <HI>Chri&s;tian Hero:</HI></P>
<Q><L>O! Is it not, that <HI>Tyranny prevails,</HI></L>
<L>And the true <HI>End of Government</HI> is lo&s;t!</L>
<L>That tho&s;e, who &s;hould defend each in his Right,</L>
<L>Betray their Tru&s;t, and &s;eize upon the Whole!</L>
<L>This, this is to rebel again&s;t that Power,</L>
<L>By which Kings reign; and turns the Arms of Heaven</L>
<L>Again&s;t it&s;elf.</L></Q>
<P>Thus a few Things, of no &s;mall Importance, have been offered by Way of <HI>Apology</HI> for <HI>the Americans:</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="012861_0033_0F8B946BC228CF88">
And where is the Hurt, or Impropriety, of my offer|ing <HI>this Apology</HI> for their Rights and Liberties; any more than in <HI>Ju&s;tin Marty</HI>'s, <HI>Tertullian</HI>'s, <HI>Athenago|ras</HI>'s, and other Writers in the primitive Church, ten|dering <HI>their Apologies</HI> for their Chri&s;tian Brethren to the <HI>Roman Emperors and Senates?</HI> And, if <HI>this At|tempt,</HI> in Conjunction with tho&s;e of <HI>others,</HI> &s;hould meet with Acceptance; and my Country, with the other Colonies, &s;hould fare in any Mea&s;ure the better for it, it will be a great Comfort to me at the <HI>Setting of my Life,</HI> and cau&s;e me to quit the Stage with more Com|po&s;ure and Satisfaction; becau&s;e <HI>due Freedom is re|&s;tored to</HI> America, <HI>and there is a comfortable Pro&s;pect of its de&s;cending</HI> to our late&s;t Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>But, if notwith&s;tanding all, that has been &s;o clearly and fully, &s;o rationally and judiciou&s;ly argued again&s;t the late Innovations, by <HI>particular Per&s;ons</HI> of various Orders, and by &s;uch re&s;pectable Bodies of Men as <HI>Councils and Repre&s;entatives, Might</HI> mu&s;t be &s;till ex|erci&s;ed for &s;ubverting and <HI>overpowering American Right;</HI> We think, and are fully per&s;uaded, that the generous and brave <HI>Americans</HI> will be <HI>di&s;po&s;ed and re|&s;olved to defend</HI> them&s;elves and their Rights, and <HI>pre|pare</HI> in the be&s;t Manner they can for doing &s;o: And, if Things, from unadvi&s;ed and ra&s;h Mea&s;ures &s;till u&s;ed, mu&s;t be brought to a de&s;perate Cri&s;is, the <HI>Coloni&s;ts</HI> will make their Appeal to HIM, who is <HI>higher than the Highe&s;t,</HI> or &s;upreme&s;t, on the Earth; who, as He <HI>always judges righteou&s;ly,</HI> always <HI>loveth Righteou&s;ne&s;s and hateth Oppre&s;&s;ion</HI> and all Manner of Iniquity: And they will <HI>hope and trust in HIM, as their Cau&s;e is ju&s;t and right, to own and &s;ucceed it: For JUST &amp; RIGHT is HE.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean while may an <HI>Engli&s;h American,</HI> &s;uita|bly to his Profe&s;&s;ion and public Bu&s;ine&s;s, be allowed to call upon all his <HI>American Brethren,</HI> while endeavouring <HI>to do their Duty to their GOD and their King,</HI> as well
<PB N="35" REF="012861_0034_0F8B946C3AB893D8">
as <HI>them&s;elves and their Country,</HI> in all Re&s;pects and In|&s;tances, <HI>to pray constantly and most humbly and earne&s;t|ly</HI> to the gracious <HI>Parent and glorious Lord of the Uni|ver&s;e!</HI></P>
<P><HI>O Thou most &s;upreme Lover and eternal Doer of Right, and Avenger of Wrongs: Shine forth, and ari&s;e, and &s;tir up thy Strength, and come &amp; &s;ave us: Maintain our Cau&s;e against them, that would &s;trive with us: Take hold of Shield and Buckler, and stand up for our Help: For our Help is in the Name of the LORD, who made Heaven and Earth: Wherefore help us, O our GOD, and &s;ave us according to thy Mercy; and &s;ay unto us,</HI> I am thy Salvation: <HI>For we tru&s;t in thy Power and Mercy through the only Mediator, our Strength and Re|deemer: To whom be Glory throughout all Ages:</HI> AMEN.</P>
