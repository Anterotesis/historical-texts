<HEAD>To the Honorable Mr. HOLDEN, One of the Directors of the Bank of <HI>England,</HI> At <HI>London.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honorable Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Flatter my &s;elf, that You will not think it any Di&s;honor to You to be own'd <HI>as a Friend of</HI> New-England, e&s;pecially in its be&s;t, its religious, In|tere&s;ts: And for this Rea&s;on I venture to dedicate the following Performance to You; de&s;iring You to re|ceive it as an Acknowledgment of Your many good and kind Offices towards us.</P>
<P>It may not be ami&s;s to inform You, that many Eminent Per&s;ons, be&s;ides Your &s;elf, in our Mother-Kingdom have thought favourably concerning us and &s;hew'd their Readine&s;s to &s;erve us. The catholic and excellent Dr. TILLOTSON, from his good Opinion of us, frequently concern'd him&s;elf for the Welfare of <HI>New-England,</HI> and intreated His Maje&s;ty King WIL|LIAM to &s;hew the marks of his peculiar Favour to|wards his faithful Subjects here, and once particularly was &s;o free as to declare in the Audience of his Maje&s;ty, that <HI>it would by no Means do well for Him to take away
<PB REF="004275_0003_10043186701BB450">from the People of</HI> New-England <HI>any of their Privi|lege.</HI> And the meritorious Bi&s;hop of <HI>Sali&s;bury,</HI> Dr. BURNET, be&s;ides many other weighty Expre&s;&s;ions of his Kindne&s;s to <HI>New-England,</HI> was once &s;o good as to profe&s;s before Dr. MATHER my honored Grandfather, that <HI>he would on the fir&s;t Opportunity declare openly in</HI> the Hou&s;e of Lords, <HI>that there was a greater Sacredne&s;s in the Charter of</HI> New-England <HI>than in tho&s;e of the Corporations in</HI> England; <HI>becau&s;e tho&s;e were only</HI> Acts of Grace; <HI>whereas the Charter of</HI> New-England <HI>was a</HI> Contract <HI>between the King and the fir&s;t Patentees:</HI> They <HI>promi&s;ed the King to enlarge his Dominions on their own Charges, provided that they and their Po&s;terity might enjoy &s;uch and &s;uch Privileges: And</HI> They <HI>had perform'd their Part: Now for</HI> the King <HI>to deprive their Po&s;terity of the Privi|leges therein granted to them, it would carry the Face of Inju&s;tice in it.</HI> And the good old Lord WHAR|TON, the la&s;t &s;urviving Member of the famous A&s;|&s;embly of Divines that met at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> who&s;e Name &s;hould be very dear to every true <HI>New-En|gli&s;h</HI> Man, upon pre&s;enting a Petition for <HI>New-En|gland</HI> by my honored Grandfather, who was then in the Agency for this Province, was pleas'd to &s;ay with great Zeal and Earne&s;tne&s;s to the King, that, <HI>if he were &s;ure to die the next Day, he would, as he now did, appear in behalf of this Country and &s;ollicit his Favour for it.</HI> And, when one, from whom I have the Honour of immediately de&s;cending, wrote an Account concerning the Affairs of <HI>New-England</HI> to the late great and good my Lord Chancellor KING, he was pleas'd to write a Letter in An&s;wer, wherein are the&s;e remarkable Pa&s;&s;ages; <HI>The Account of your Country was very acceptable to me: And, wherein I can &s;erve either it or you, I &s;hall always he ready; It is Matter of Joy, that the Chri&s;tian Re|ligion and Learning do make &s;uch con&s;iderable Advances in tho&s;e Parts of the World. And indeed, wherever
<PB REF="004275_0004_1004318A570A6C18">the Chri&s;tian Religion is propo&s;ed in its native Plain|ne&s;s and Simplicity, it is mo&s;t likely to &s;ucceed.</HI></P>
<P>Hence You &s;ee, Honorable Sir, that You are not &s;ingular in Your Regards towards us and in Your Inclinations and Endeavours to &s;erve us, but have &s;uch good Company as may be an Encouragement unto You in them.</P>
<P>I need not mention to You the Claim, which the&s;e Churches have to their Religious Privileges <HI>as Men, as Chri&s;tians, and as Prote&s;tants:</HI> But I would ob&s;erve to You, that the&s;e Privileges are confirm'd unto them by the <HI>Charter,</HI> which was granted to this Province by King WILLIAM and Queen MARY of glorious and immortal Memory.</P>
<P>And I would further acquaint You, that, &s;ince the Grant of our valuable <HI>Charter,</HI> the <HI>&s;ame</HI> was ratified and confirmed by his mo&s;t excellent Maje&s;ty King GEORGE the <HI>Fir&s;t;</HI> and there has a Law pa&s;s'd in this Province in the <HI>fourth and fifth</HI> of WILLIAM and MARY, wherin it is expre&s;ly provided, that <HI>the re&s;pective Churches in this Province &s;hall enjoy all their Privileges and Freedoms re&s;pecting Divine Wor|&s;hip, Church Order and Di&s;cipline, and &s;hall be encou|raged in the peaceable and regular Profe&s;&s;ion and Prac|tice thereof:</HI> Which Law has bin as it were touch'd by the Royal Sceptre: For it has bin approved by his Maje&s;ty of <HI>Great Britain:</HI> So that, Honorable Sir, the Liberties of the&s;e Churches mu&s;t be deem'd to be <HI>as Sacred Things as the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Liberties of the National Churches of</HI> England and Scotland.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, Sir, I can truely affirm, not only con|cerning the Church of which I am the unworthy Servant, but al&s;o <HI>in behalf of all the Churches of our ble&s;&s;ed SAVIOUR in</HI> New-England <HI>walking in the
<PB REF="004275_0005_1004318E855599C0">&s;ame Faith and Order with our &s;elves,</HI> that they <HI>main|tain an inviolable Allegiance to his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty</HI> of Great Brittain, as they did to his Godlike Father before Him, and that <HI>they firmly adhere to the Suc|ce&s;&s;ion of the Imperial Crown of</HI> Great Britain in the pre&s;ent Royal Family: Nor, I am well a&s;&s;ured, is there &s;o much as <HI>one Per&s;on in the Communion of any of our Churches,</HI> but who has a <HI>cordial Regard and Affection for the Per&s;on and Family</HI> of our pre|&s;ent mo&s;t gracious Sovereign and <HI>yields a delightful Subjection to his au&s;picious Government.</HI></P>
<P>Now con&s;idering the&s;e Things; and con&s;idering withal, what an <HI>honorable,</HI> as well as va&s;tly beneficial, <HI>Addition we have made to the wide and extended Empire of the King of</HI> Great Britain: I &s;aid, <HI>Honorable Addition:</HI> For, while the other <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Provinces and Colonies have for the mo&s;t Part bin &s;ettled by more indifferent Per&s;ons, and for their Nouri&s;hment and Support have bin obliged to the Royal Bounties; This Province was founded by worthy Per&s;ons, con|&s;iderable for their Families, Educations and Fortunes, as well as their &s;uperior Probity, Religion and Good|ne&s;s, who with va&s;t Hazard and Expence pa&s;t the wide <HI>Atlantic,</HI> and con&s;um'd their Trea&s;ures and lo&s;t their Lives in the&s;e, then barbarous and inclement, Regions, that &s;o their Po&s;terity might &s;erve their GOD and their King in the peaceable Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and Exerci&s;e of tho&s;e Civil and Religious Privileges, which they had purcha&s;ed and earned for them: Nor did the Crown advance any Sums of Money for a&s;&s;i&s;ting and encouraging them in their expen&s;ive and hazardous, but noble, Undertaking: Certainly, upon the&s;e Con&s;iderations, if we do not <HI>challenge and claim as our Due,</HI> we may well promi&s;e our &s;elves however, <HI>the Royal Favour and Protection in the un|di&s;turb'd Enjoyment of the Liberties of our Churches and Schools.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="004275_0006_100406328FF7EFB8">
I have rehear&s;ed the&s;e Things to You, Honorable Sir, that &s;o, as You have Occa&s;ion for it, You may improve them to our Advantage and Comfort: In doing which, as You will <HI>encrea&s;e our Obligations,</HI> which already are very great unto You; &s;o, I doubt not, You will <HI>add to Your own Con&s;olation and Joy:</HI> For, as the wi&s;e Governour of the World has hitherto <HI>bla&s;ted the De&s;igns and Attempts of the Enemies to</HI> New-England, &s;o He has <HI>liberally rewarded and ble&s;&s;ed its Friends:</HI> And it is our Prayer and Hope, that He would graciou&s;ly continue to do &s;o, and, in particular, that He would <HI>remunerate and pro&s;per the honored Mr.</HI> HOLDEN <HI>according to all the Good which he has done to the Churches and Country of</HI> New-England.</P>
<P>The Ta&s;k which is undertaken in the following Sheets, cannot by any Means be accounted &s;ingular; ina&s;much as it is a common Thing in the <HI>Republic of Letters</HI> for the Learned to <HI>apologize for tho&s;e Di&s;|ciplinary,</HI> as well as <HI>Doctrinal, Principles, for which they have a peculiar and, as they imagine, ju&s;t E&s;teem and Veneration.</HI></P>
<P>But, as to the Freedom of this Dedication, altho' it may be a great and probably unbecoming one; yet You are well acquainted with the Occa&s;ion of it; and, I believe, my Country will judge, that You were highly de&s;erving of this public Manife&s;ta|tion of Re&s;pect and Honor for You.</P>
<P>I cannot but hope, from what I have heard and learnt concerning Mr. HOLDEN'S generous Senti|ments, that the following Attempt will be accepta|ble unto You. But, however this may be, give me Leave to beg the further Continuance of Your

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>BEING &s;en&s;ible, that <HI>long Life is not to be de|pended on</HI> here below, I have thought it advi&s;e|able to <HI>leave &s;ome abiding Te&s;timonies that I have lived</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Quatenus nobis denegatur diu vivere, relinguamus ali|quid, quo nos vixi&s;&s;e te&s;temur. Plin. <HI>lib. 3. Epi&s;t. 8.</HI> Caninio.</NOTE> behind me in the World; and I have determin'd to <HI>bear and leave my Te&s;timony,</HI> &s;uch as it is, <HI>to the Order of the Go&s;pel in the Churches of</HI> New-England.</P>
<P>As many of our Prote&s;tant Brethren <HI>abroad,</HI> &s;o mo&s;t of our People at Home, mu&s;t certainly have <HI>&s;ome Knowlege of the Privileges</HI> claim'd by the&s;e Churches <HI>and the Rea&s;ons of their Attachment unto them.</HI></P>
<P>But, ina&s;much as They may be de&s;irous of a <HI>further Acquaintance</HI> with our Religious Privileges and <HI>what we have to offer in Defence of them;</HI> I have therefore thought it proper for their Sakes to prepare and publi&s;h the following Apology, wherein I have endeavour'd to <HI>illu&s;trate and confirm the more di&s;tingui&s;hing Privileges of the&s;e Churches.</HI></P>
<P>That &s;o this Attempt might be more fully and effec|tually an&s;wer'd, I have <HI>con&s;ulted the publi&s;h'd Works and many of the Manu&s;cripts of the Fathers of</HI> New-En|gland, I have <HI>&s;earch'd the Records of the Primitive Church,</HI> I have <HI>read a con&s;iderable Number of later Wri|ters,</HI> and, in fine, I have <HI>examin'd the Writings of the In&s;pired Apo&s;tles</HI> with Indu&s;try and Care: And hence I have bin enabled to prepare the en&s;uing <HI>Apology,</HI> and
<PB N="ii" REF="004275_0009_100431FDB74A57B8">offer it to the Con&s;ideration of my Countrymen and all our Prote&s;tant Brethren.</P>
<P>By this Apology They will &s;oon &s;ee, that we do not think <HI>Churches are &s;uch Machines,</HI> as many on the other Side of the <HI>Atlantic</HI> take them to be, <HI>contriv'd and to be improv'd for the outward Advantage of &s;ome &s;ort of Per&s;ons;</HI> but that they are <HI>Means for the Edification and &s;piritual Advantage of the Faithful,</HI> which they are oblig'd to re&s;pect and ob&s;erve in Obedience to JESUS CHRIST our Saviour and &s;upreme LORD: For, to u&s;e the Words of the learned Abbot FLEURY con|cerning his <HI>Hi&s;tory,</HI> which may properly be applied to our <HI>Apology</HI> and u&s;ed concerning it, <HI>In</HI> This <HI>we have a Sort of Politicks, which are Spiritual and all Divine; a Government that is founded on Charity, the Public Good being the &s;ole End of it: For the Intere&s;t of the Gover|nours is no Way concerned in it <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Fleury</HI>'s Di&s;cour&s;e on Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory.</NOTE>.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides a <HI>particular Defence of the di&s;tingui&s;hing Pri|vileges of the&s;e Churches</HI> in the following Attempt; there follows after this Preface <HI>a General Di&s;cour&s;e Prelimi|nary concerning the Nature, Grounds and Rea&s;ons, Anti|quity and Advantages of</HI> Congregational Churches; which, I believe, will be judg'd by the Impartial and Di&s;intere&s;ted a &s;ufficient Vindication of them.</P>
<P>In the Clo&s;e, and as an Appendix to the Book, I have taken Care to publi&s;h &s;ome Things that were never printed before among us, as well as &s;ome other Things that have already bin given to the Public, but are now &s;carcely to be found, <HI>concerning the Liberties of the</HI> New-Engli&s;h <HI>Churches, their catholic and comprehen|&s;ive Principles, their declared Regard e&s;pecially to the Life and Power of true Religion and their Duty and Intere&s;t to continue in their re&s;pectful and affectionate Attachment to the&s;e Things.</HI></P>
<P>Some perhaps may judge, that, in attempting to write an Apology for the Liberties of our Churches, I
<PB N="iii" REF="004275_0010_100431953057FA00">have undertaken a Ta&s;k, to which I am unequal: And probably it may be &s;o in Reality and Truth: But yet I am inclin'd to expre&s;s my &s;elf concerning my Per|formance, as TULLY concerning his <HI>Orator, The Work may be great and arduous; but to him, that is inflamed with Love to it, there is not found any &s;ufficient Difficulty in the Way to di&s;courage him from it <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Magnum Opus conamur &amp; arduum; Sed nihil difficile Amanti puto. Cicer. <HI>ad</HI> Brut. <HI>Orator.</HI></NOTE>.</HI></P>
<P>However, if the Remarks and Arguments made and collected in the following Pages &s;hould be accounted &s;lender and un&s;atisfactory; yet, if by Means of them &s;ome abler Per&s;on here or el&s;ewhere &s;hall be excited to <HI>&s;et the Liberties of our Chri&s;tian Brethren in a fairer Light and to &s;hew more Strength and Vigor in defending them,</HI> I &s;hall be &s;o far from <HI>repenting</HI> of my Care and Trouble in preparing and publi&s;hing the following E&s;&s;ay, that I &s;hall <HI>heartily rejoice in the good Succe&s;s of it.</HI></P>
<P>But, notwith&s;tanding This, I mu&s;t be &s;o free as to declare, that in the en&s;uing Pages <HI>I have endeavour'd faithfully to repre&s;ent the Sen&s;e and Meaning of the fir&s;t Planters of the&s;e Churches:</HI> So that, with reference to what follows, I may write in the Style of VEGETIUS, <HI>I am far from a&s;&s;uming any Thing of Authority to my &s;elf in the following Sheets: If I have collected the Sen&s;e of others right and well epitomiz'd their Thoughts <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Nihil mibi Authoritatis a&s;&s;umo: Sed gua ab aliis di&s;per&s;a velut in Ordimem epitomata con&s;cribo, Veget, <HI>l. 1. c. 8.</HI></NOTE> which are variou&s;ly di&s;pers'd and reduced them to a clear and natural Order, I &s;hall think it &s;ufficient.</HI></P>
<P>There is one Thing for which I expect to be &s;ome|what blamed: And this is, that, in illu&s;trating and con|firming the Liberties of our Churches, I generally write in the Plural Number; whence &s;ome may conjecture, that it was <HI>at the Direction or by the De&s;ire of the Chur|ches here,</HI> that I write this Apology for them: But,
<PB N="iv" REF="004275_0011_100431983B1532C8">wherever I u&s;e &s;uch a Way of expre&s;&s;ing my &s;elf, I de&s;ire always to be con&s;ider'd as <HI>repre&s;enting what I take to have bin the Thoughts of the Planters of the&s;e Churches, and &s;o of the Churches them&s;elves:</HI> Nor would I by any means be under&s;tood as directed or advi&s;ed by the Churches to enter upon this Performance: For, if it were &s;o, I &s;hould <HI>lo&s;e the Comfort and Satisfaction,</HI> it not <HI>the Credit and Honour, of making my Free-Will Offering to their Service and Advantage.</HI></P>
<P>Nor is it at all improbable, that &s;ome may find Fault with my <HI>frequent Quotations</HI> from learned Authors and References to them: But, if the Province undertaken by me did not unavoidably lead me to make tho&s;e Citations and References, I am very much mi&s;taken: And, if it did, it is, I think, a &s;ufficient Excu&s;e for me.</P>
<P>As to the Pa&s;&s;ages &s;elected from the <HI>ancient Fathers,</HI> I have only this to &s;ay, that they are generally taken from tho&s;e, which are accounted the <HI>be&s;t Editions:</HI> And I believe my References to them are exact and punc|tual; tho' it is po&s;&s;ible, that, in tran&s;cribing them into my <HI>Common-Place Book</HI> and this &s;econd Tran&s;cription of them, &s;ome accidental Mi&s;take may have occur'd, which any good-natured Man can overlook and forgive.</P>
<P>I have one Favour to a&s;k of tho&s;e, that &s;hall read this Book, which, I think, cannot in Rea&s;on be denied me: And this is, that, if any of them &s;hall think fit to animadvert upon any Part or the whole of it, they would be &s;o kind as to put their Names to what they publi&s;h: For otherwi&s;e they may not expect to have any Notice taken of them; nor may they expect any, if they do, unle&s;s they write in &s;uch a Manner as to re|quire a &s;uitable An&s;wer from me.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be very much di&s;appointed, if, by the Publi|cation of this &s;mall Volume, I do not gain the Di&s;|plea&s;ure and Anger, if not <HI>mortal Enmity,</HI> of many: But however I &s;hall not be &s;orry for it, if I &s;ecure to my &s;elf, as I hope that I &s;hall, <HI>the perpetual Regard

<P>Since my writing this Book, there has a Pamphlet come to my Hands, which it is &s;aid was written by a Gentleman of the Law in <HI>England,</HI> the Title of which is, <HI>An Examination of the Scheme of Church-Power, as laid down in the</HI> Codex Juris Eccle&s;ia&s;tici Angli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> As I was highly gratified in reading of this Pamphlet; &s;o I cannot help reciting &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages from it, which were peculiarly grateful to me; not doubting but that they will be &s;ingularly plea&s;ing to my Countrymen, and not the le&s;s &s;o for coming from the Pen of an eminent Lawyer. In Pag. 120th, 121&s;t, 122d, 123d, he writes as follows, 'If the Gentlemen of Synodical Learn|ing will permit us to carry our Enquiry on this Head &s;o far back as to the Apo&s;tolick Age, we &s;hall find that the Laiety at that Time bore a Part in the mo&s;t &s;olemn Deliberations which concern'd the Intere&s;t or Government of the Church.

But the Apo&s;tles did not exclude the Brethren, the Body of the People, from their Coun&s;els; nor dictated magi&s;terially to them. They rea&s;on'd as with Men and Chri&s;tians; and made no other U&s;e of their &s;upe|rior Gifts and per&s;onal Knowledge of Facts, than to convince and per&s;uade.

In Conformity to the Practice of the Apo&s;tolick Age, the Laiety continued to have a Share in the Government of the Church, <HI>as Members of a volun|tary Society, and intere&s;ted in its Concerns;</HI> till the Conver&s;ion of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors made Way for very con&s;iderable Changes in the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Polity.

For tho' the Name and Shadow of the Senatorial and Tribunitial Powers remain'd, the&s;e Powers had been long extingui&s;h'd: And the whole Legi&s;lative Power of the Empire was <HI>really</HI> ve&s;ted in the Emperor.

The Pre&s;ence and Con|currence of the Emperor to the Acts of the Council, gave them their binding Force, and incorporated them into the Laws of the Empire. For the whole Legi&s;lative Power being, as I ob&s;erv'd, in the Empe|ror, nothing could become Part of the Law, without his Authority.

<P>But what can be &s;aid, if, notwith&s;tanding &s;uch fair Accounts from di&s;intere&s;ted and hone&s;t Men, the infa|tuated humane Race will <HI>not believe the Truth, but take Plea&s;ure in Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s and Oppre&s;&s;ion?</HI> Truely it mu&s;t be accounted a melancholy Thing, and be <HI>for a Lamentation</HI> among all the &s;incere Lovers of Man|kind.</P>

<HEAD>A DISCOURSE Concerning the Nature, Grounds and Rea&s;ons, Antiquity and Advantages of CONGREGATIONAL CHURCHES; wherein al&s;o An An&s;wer is endeavoured to &s;uch Objections as have bin rai&s;ed again&s;t them.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Churches of NEW ENGLAND are nominally and profe&s;&s;edly <HI>Congregati|onal:</HI> They do not approve the Name of <HI>Independent <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Platform of Church Di&s;cipline. Chap. II.</NOTE>,</HI> and are abhorrent from &s;uch Principles of Independency as would keep them from <HI>giving an Account of the Matters</HI> to their Brethren of neighbouring So|cieties, <HI>regularly demanding if of them.</HI></P>
<P>They apprehend, that a <HI>Congregational Church is, by the In&s;titution of our great LORD and King JESUS CHRIST, a Part of the vi&s;ible Church in its militant State, con&s;i&s;ting of a Company of holy Brethren, united
<PB N="2" REF="004275_0019_100431AC352C8898">together by mutual Engagements for the publick Wor&s;hip of GOD, and their common Improvement and Edification in Knowledge and all Goodne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Nor have they any Thing to object again&s;t that Article of the Church of ENGLAND, which &s;peaks of <HI>the vi&s;ible Church of CHRIST</HI> in &s;uch a Manner that they can heartily &s;ub&s;cribe unto it. For they firmly be|lieve it to be, as is there declared <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">XIXth Article of the Church of <HI>England.</HI></NOTE>, <HI>a Congregation of faithful Men, in which the pure Word of GOD is preached and the Sacraments be duly admini&s;tred according to CHRIST'S Ordinance in all tho&s;e Things that of Ne|ce&s;&s;ity are requi&s;ite to the &s;ame:</HI> So that the Earl of SHAFTSBURY was exceedingly in the Right, when in a famous Debate He &s;aid before <HI>the Hou&s;e of LORDS,</HI> that He found the <HI>nineteenth Article did define the Church directly as the</HI> Independents <HI>do:</HI> For really it does &s;o. Onely, if it had bin added in the Article, <HI>wherein al&s;o the Di&s;cipline of CHRIST'S Church is duely exerci&s;ed,</HI> they think that the De&s;cription would have bin more perfect.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Churches,</HI> which an&s;wer to this De&s;cription, they are <HI>Congregational;</HI> and, concerning &s;uch Churches as The&s;e, the&s;e Churches are not a&s;hamed to declare and maintain, that they take them to be <HI>in&s;ti|tuted by the great Head of the Church:</HI> So that, if any &s;hould ask us the &s;ame Que&s;tion which the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> frequently ask our Prote&s;tant Brethren abroad, <HI>Where were your</HI> [Congregational] <HI>Churches before LU|THER?</HI> We have the &s;ame An&s;wer to give which our ble&s;&s;ed SAVIOUR gave to an Enquiry of the Jews concerning HIMSELF, <HI>Search the Scriptures: For they te&s;tify concerning Them.</HI></P>
<P>A Dean of <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> we know, has, not long &s;ince, in a Sermon, <HI>concerning Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Authority,</HI> declared in the&s;e Words, <HI>He mu&s;t never have look'd into Scripture who is capable of thinking it a perfect Rule of Wor&s;hip, I mean, external Wor&s;hip and Di&s;cipline: But,</HI> adds Mr.
<PB N="3" REF="004275_0020_100431ADBA07ED30">Dean, <HI>he that will take in the Writings of the Primitive Church as a Supplement to Scripture in the&s;e Points, can|not be at a Lo&s;s to know what are the Powers of Church Governours or what the Obedience due unto them <NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">P. 29 of &s;aid Sermon.</NOTE>.</HI> But, as For us, we are not &s;en&s;ible of the Want, nor are we de&s;irous, of any <HI>Supplements to the Scriptures</HI> in the&s;e Matters: Nor yet dare we indulge a Tho't of being <HI>wi&s;e above what is written</HI> in &s;uch Points as The&s;e: For we find &s;ufficient Rea&s;on for falling into the Sentiments of the learned Mr. Abbot FLEURY, which are thus expre&s;&s;ed in his <HI>Di&s;cour&s;es on Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory,&mdash;There was nothing wanting at that Time</HI> [h. e. the Time of Primitive Chri&s;tianity] <HI>for the due Government of the Church: No! When the Apo&s;tles founded it, there was without Doubt nothing omitted in laying down Practical Rules as much for the Conduct of the whole Body, as the Manners of particular Per&s;ons: And the&s;e Rules were neither imperfect nor impracticable, but &s;uch as were ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to bring Them to a Go&s;pel Perfection, more or le&s;s, according to the different Mea&s;ures of GOD'S Grace. The&s;e Rules were not imperfect; &s;ince, as the Chri&s;tian Religion was the Work of GOD, it had all Perfection at fir&s;t. It is not like the Inventions of Men, which have their Ri&s;e, Progre&s;s and Fall. GOD acquires neither Knowledge nor Power by Degrees.</HI> All Things, <HI>&s;ays our SAVIOUR,</HI> that I have heard of my Father, I have made known unto you: <HI>And, &s;peaking of the HOLY GHOST,</HI> He will lead you into all Truth: <HI>And, to &s;hew that this does not only relate to the Tenets of Religion, He &s;ays further,</HI> Go, teach all Nations, teaching them to ob&s;erve all Things what&s;oever I have com|manded you. <HI>Every Thing then was equally e&s;tabli&s;hed at fir&s;t, which could be of U&s;e to Them in Practice, as well as in Faith.</HI> &mdash; And therefore we cannot approve of any <HI>Humane Supplements to the perfect Rule of Wor&s;hip
<PB N="4" REF="004275_0021_100431B088F78070">and Order,</HI> with which we are favored in the holy Scrip|tures.</P>
<P>We think indeed, that there are <HI>&s;ome Circum&s;tances relating to the Wor&s;hip of GOD and the Government in the&s;e Churches,</HI> which, agreeable to what is practi&s;ed in other Societies, <HI>may be regulated by Natural Light and Chri&s;tian Prudence according to the general Rules of GOD'S Word,</HI> which ought for ever to have a particu|lar Regard paid unto them.</P>
<P>But at the &s;ame Time our Churches judge, that they are <HI>not left at any Uncertainty about the E&s;&s;entials of that Polity,</HI> which our Lord JESUS CHRIST hath &s;ettled and would have to be ob&s;erved: For it appears to them, that there is <HI>a Divine In&s;titution</HI> for the following Things; to wit, that there &s;hould be <HI>public A&s;&s;emblies</HI> for the Wor&s;hip of GOD and the Improvement of His People in Knowledge and Vertue, and that none &s;hould officiate in them but <HI>&s;uch Officers as CHRIST has ap|pointed;</HI> that Chri&s;tians &s;hould be <HI>&s;tated Members of one particular Church,</HI> and that <HI>particular Churches &s;hould have proper &s;ettled Pa&s;tors</HI> in them who &s;hould live among them and in&s;truct them by their Preaching and Example; that <HI>Pa&s;tors and People by mutual Con&s;ent be|come related to one another,</HI> and that, by <HI>vertue of the&s;e Relations</HI> which are of Divine Appointment as well as by their own Choice and Con&s;ent, they are <HI>formed and con&s;tituted a Spiritual Society of CHRIST'S In&s;titution;</HI> that <HI>none</HI> &s;hould be <HI>admitted</HI> into the Communion of &s;uch a Society but <HI>&s;uch as profe&s;s the true Religion and appear in a Judgment of Charity to be holy Per&s;ons;</HI> that all &s;uch as are allow'd the Privilege of Communion in &s;uch a Society &s;hould <HI>relieve, comfort and a&s;&s;i&s;t one another in outward Re&s;pects,</HI> but that they &s;hould <HI>e&s;pecially be help|ful to one another in their be&s;t Intere&s;ts;</HI> and that, if any <HI>break in upon the Laws of CHRIST and the Society</HI> to which they are related, they are <HI>accountable to the Society and cen&s;urable by it;</HI> and, in fine, that <HI>all &s;uch particular Societies &s;hould live at Peace within them&s;elves, and hold a
<PB N="5" REF="004275_0022_100431B20DD26420">friendly Corre&s;pondence and Chri&s;tian Communion with other Churches</HI> for their mutual Support, Edification and Comfort.</P>
<P>This is the Polity which the&s;e Churches own; and this is <HI>all the Form of Church Government</HI> which they can find in the Scriptures to be <HI>in&s;tituted</HI> by their great Lawgiver and King: Nor can they imagine, that any can with Rea&s;on deny that &s;uch Churches as the&s;e are <HI>true Churches of JESUS CHRIST.</HI></P>
<P>Nay, if tho&s;e are <HI>true Churches of CHRIST</HI> in which <HI>the pure Doctrines and Precepts of the Go&s;pel are taught and inculcated,</HI> and <HI>the Sacraments of the now Covenant are duely admini&s;tred</HI> according to the In&s;titution of our great SAVIOUR, and <HI>a &s;acred Regard is always bad to what&s;oever our LORD has commanded;</HI> the&s;e Churches may then e&s;teem them&s;elves to be <HI>true Churches</HI> of CHRIST and even account them&s;elves <HI>the true&s;t Churches</HI> according to our SAVIOUR'S In&s;titution: For, in their conforming to that In&s;titution with inviolable Fidelity, they &s;hine with &s;uperior Glory to others.</P>
<P>The <HI>Principles,</HI> upon which the&s;e Churches are founded, are &s;uch, that they need not be afraid or a&s;ham'd of owning them before the whole World: For, accord|ing to the Account of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Condom</HI> concerning our Congregational Brethren abroad, the&s;e Churches believe, that <HI>every Chri&s;tian ought to follow the Light of his own Mind,</HI> the Conviction of his own Con&s;cience, <HI>nor is obliged to &s;ubmit his Judgment to the Authority of any Per&s;on or any Eccle&s;ia&s;tical A&s;&s;embly.</HI> 'Tis true they are for <HI>paying a mo&s;t profound Deference to the Word of God; nor</HI> do they <HI>refu&s;e to embrace the Deci&s;ions of Coun|cils and Synods,</HI> if upon a due and impartial Examina|tion they appear to be rea&s;onable and Scriptural: But the Thing, which the&s;e Churches utterly di&s;claim and refu&s;e to do, is to <HI>&s;ubmit their Judgment to that of any A&s;&s;embly</HI> however con&s;iderable: For they are per&s;uaded, that <HI>the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Societies of Men are liable to Mi&s;takes and Errors;</HI> and therefore they <HI>&s;ubmit to the
<PB N="6" REF="004275_0023_100431B4C526FC28">Word of GOD only,</HI> the Authority of which is undi&s;|perted and infallible with them.</P>
<P>And, as the&s;e Churches a&s;&s;ert and claim <HI>the Right of private Judgment</HI> as Men, as Chri&s;tians, and as Pro|te&s;tants; they al&s;o <HI>declare for and maintain the Rights of particular Churches:</HI> For they conceive, that <HI>every Chri&s;tian Society or Church ought not to have any Depen|dance in Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Matters,</HI> nor are obliged to ac|knowledge the Authority of Councils or Synods for their Direction and Government, but ought to be go|verned within it&s;elf and by its own Laws. They ac|knowledge indeed, that they ought to exerci&s;e their pro|per Juri&s;diction and Government within them&s;elves <HI>with Dependance upon our ble&s;&s;ed SAVIOUR,</HI> together with His Holy SPIRIT and unerring Oracles: But they think them&s;elves by Divine Right excu&s;ed from Sub|jection to any other Church, tho' it be a Mother one, and that they may <HI>exerci&s;e an independent Juri&s;diction within them&s;elves.</HI> And the Rea&s;on why the&s;e Churches give into &s;uch Sentiments is &s;ufficient: For we cannot &s;uppo&s;e, that <HI>Churches are to be propagated as worldly Dominions;</HI> as tho' <HI>Original Churches,</HI> which &s;end forth their <HI>Colonies,</HI> mu&s;t maintain Dominion and perpetual Power over &s;uch as came from them: For, after this Rate, the Churches of <HI>Geneva, Heidelberg and the united Provinces</HI> mu&s;t claim a Dominion and Juri&s;diction over the other Prote&s;tant Churches: But we conceive of our Churches, <HI>as of adult Sons,</HI> who are not at the Di&s;po&s;al of their Ance&s;tors, but <HI>have a Right to govern</HI> them&s;elves and <HI>exerci&s;e their Power with re&s;pect to their own Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|ons;</HI> or as of <HI>Branches</HI> taken from true <HI>Olive Trees,</HI> which, being planted and watered, grow and encrea&s;e, without any Manner of Dependance upon the Trees from which they were taken, for Pre&s;ervation, Support and Fructifying Vertue <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Ex <HI>Voet.</HI> De&s;perat.

<P>The&s;e Principles are the firm and unmoveable Foun|dations
<PB N="7" REF="004275_0024_100431B8A3500A00">of the&s;e and all Congregational Churches: And, wherever the&s;e Principles prevail, as methinks they &s;hould prevail every where among rational and con&s;ide|rate Chri&s;tians; there the <HI>Congregational Form of Church-Government</HI> mu&s;t be acknowledged and preferred before any other.</P>
<P>But, while the&s;e Churches e&s;teem this their Form of Government, ina&s;much as it is e&s;tabli&s;hed upon &s;uch un|&s;haken Principles; they cannot but entertain an indiffer|ent, not to &s;ay a mean, Opinion of <HI>National Churches</HI> in various Kingdoms and Countries, <HI>with an Uniformity of Doctrine and of Di&s;cipline,</HI> which are a di&s;tinct Govern|ment from the Civil, their Offices and their Juri&s;diction being different: For they apprehend, that <HI>&s;uch Churches have introduced Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Tyranny and Antichri&s;t into the World;</HI> and they are almo&s;t ready to declare with Dr. DU MOULIN, that <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Lewis Du Moulin</HI> concerning the Government of the Independents. p. 23.</NOTE> <HI>a National Church has bin, is and will be the Cau&s;e, that there will never be a Church in the World in its true Purity, unle&s;s Almighty God re|&s;erves &s;ome among the Congregational Churches:</HI> For in &s;uch an E&s;tabli&s;hment it is <HI>not Truth nor Goodne&s;s</HI> that influences and governs; but it is the <HI>greate&s;t Number</HI> to|gether with <HI>worldly Power and Intere&s;t,</HI> that rules and bears down all before it: So that it is not from a blind, partial and unrea&s;onable Regard for the <HI>Congregational Way,</HI> that the&s;e Churches do not approve of National E&s;tabli&s;hments; but from a clear Apprehen&s;ion of the <HI>Mi&s;chiefs ari&s;ing from &s;uch National E&s;tabli&s;hments.</HI></P>

<P>As for the&s;e Churches, they are &s;atisfied with <HI>the Congregational Way,</HI> and judge <HI>the Proofs</HI> of Congrega|tional Churches <HI>from Scripture and the pure&s;t Antiquity</HI> to be &s;trong and unan&s;werable.

<P>There are, we are &s;en&s;ible, various plau&s;ible Pleas and Arguments <HI>again&s;t the Right of particular Churches
<PB N="14" REF="004275_0031_100431C648C623B8">to act within and govern them&s;elves.</HI> Some in&s;i&s;t upon it, that <HI>the Apo&s;tles bad Power over particular Churches</HI> and that <HI>their Succe&s;&s;ors therefore &s;hould have Power over them</HI> al&s;o. Others plead, that <HI>particular Churches &s;hould be ab&s;olutely &s;ubject to their own Elders or to other Churches.</HI> And many others argue, that <HI>particular Churches &s;hould be dependant on Councils and other Judicatories,</HI> and that <HI>they ought to be determined</HI> by them, as the <HI>Jewi&s;h Syna|gogues were by the Sanhedrim at JERUSALEM.&mdash;</HI> The&s;e are the chief Arguments that are brought again&s;t <HI>the Right of particular Churches to act within them&s;elves and govern them&s;elves:</HI> And the&s;e &s;hall be di&s;tinctly pro|po&s;ed, examined and refuted.</P>
<P>As to the Argument, which is bro't by many again&s;t the <HI>Congregational Form of Government, from the Power of the Apo&s;tles over particular Churches,</HI> by which it is concluded that <HI>their Succe&s;&s;ors &s;hould have Power over them</HI> al&s;o; This Argument will ea&s;ily be enervated by <HI>con&s;idering the Extent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and Limits of the Apo&s;tolical Power.</HI></P>
<P>Now it mu&s;t be acknowleged, that <HI>the Apo&s;tolical Power reached to every Church as much as to any one:</HI> For, as they were empowered to <HI>di&s;ciple all Nations and baptize</HI> through the whole World, they were al&s;o direct|ed <HI>to feed the Sheep and Lambs</HI> of CHRIST'S Fold, let it be &s;aid, every where; and I am ready to grant, that this <HI>Feeding</HI> them implies in it <HI>all the Acts of Pa&s;toral Government.</HI></P>
<P>But, if all this be allowed; yet this will be no good Rea&s;on why any <HI>pretended Succe&s;&s;ors</HI> to the Apo&s;tles &s;hould have &s;uch an exten&s;ive Power. How indeed &s;hould they come by it? For it does not yet appear that our SAVIOUR gave, and His Apo&s;tles tran&s;mit|ted it unto them: It follows therefore, that, altho' the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> might have <HI>&s;uch a wide Power</HI> and exten&s;ive Influence, <HI>their Power and Influence ended with them,</HI> and <HI>no others may claim it to them&s;elves and act in vertu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="004275_0032_100431C921985F50">
And be&s;ides I am ready to acknowledge <HI>the Power of the Apo&s;tles to be extended not only to all Churches, but al&s;o to the Performance of the various particular Offices in the &s;everal Churches:</HI> So that, as <HI>Pa&s;tors,</HI> as <HI>Teachers,</HI> as <HI>Rulers</HI> and as <HI>Deacons,</HI> they might <HI>teach and exhort, govern, receive and di&s;tribute the Offerings of the Church:</HI> Nay I am willing to grant for the pre&s;ent, that <HI>any one Apo&s;tle or Evangeli&s;t might baptize or cen&s;ure</HI> any Offen|der, ju&s;t as if the whole Church were pre&s;ent and con|curr'd in tho&s;e Actions.</P>
<P>But what then? Will it follow, becau&s;e PHILIP baptized <HI>the Ethiopian Eunuch</HI> without any Church, and the Apo&s;tle PAUL excommunicated ALEXANDER without any, that therefore this was their con&s;tant Prac|tice? No &s;urely: For, when the Apo&s;tle PAUL could <HI>obtain the Con&s;ent of the Church and Pre&s;bytery</HI> in the Exerci&s;e of any Act or Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Power, he readily took it, as <HI>in the Ordination of</HI> Timothy <HI>and the Ex|communication of the Ince&s;tuous</HI> Corinthian.</P>
<P>It may therefore be fairly concluded, that <HI>the Apo&s;tles,</HI> when they were <HI>di&s;tant from all Churches, put forth their Power in the Admini&s;tration of any Church-Acts,</HI> and the Power which they had received of CHRIST was &s;uffi|cient to countenance and ju&s;tify them in &s;o doing; but that in Churches, which were regularly form'd and organical, they did not exert any <HI>&s;uch Power as was in|con&s;i&s;tent with the Privileges of the People.</HI> Nay they were &s;o far from it, that we have Rea&s;on to think, that they did not <HI>baptize or ordain or excommunicate without the Con&s;ent of the People. Were not all Things belonging to the Churches,</HI> whether PAUL or APOLLOS or CEPHAS? Did not the&s;e <HI>derive their Power of acting in them from Them under CHRIST?</HI> And <HI>were not the Apo&s;tles given to the Churches?</HI> Truely the Scriptures affirm &s;o, nor ever &s;ay that <HI>the Churches were given to the Apo&s;tles or any other Rulers.</HI> And, as for the In&s;tances which have bin produced, from which <HI>the Plenitude of the Apo&s;tolical Power</HI> is &s;ometimes argued; it mu&s;t fir&s;t of
<PB N="16" REF="004275_0033_100431CFBAED76E8">all he proved, that <HI>there were Churches formed and gathered in the Places where they admini&s;tred the Ordi|nances of CHRIST and the Di&s;cipline of His Appointment,</HI> before there can be any Thing argued from tho&s;e In|&s;tances: For, if there were <HI>no formed Churches,</HI> and <HI>it has not yet bin proved that there were in tho&s;e Places;</HI> it is not at all to be wondred at, if <HI>the Apo&s;tles did not con|&s;ult the Churches, but acted alone:</HI> They could do no otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>But, even allowing that the Apo&s;tles in the Fulne&s;s of their Apo&s;tolical Power did the&s;e and &s;uch like Acts when and where they plea&s;ed, without any Regard to the People; &s;till what is all this to &s;uch as <HI>pretend them|&s;elves to be Succe&s;&s;ors of the Apo&s;tles?</HI> For have they any <HI>&s;uch Power and Authority?</HI> Or, <HI>ought they to have</HI> any &s;uch? Or, if any &s;uch Pretenders are in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, <HI>how came they by it? &mdash;</HI> Surely the&s;e are the Men, that <HI>enter not by the Door into the Sheepfold, but they climb up &s;ome other Way:</HI> They are therefore to be con&s;idered by Mankind as <HI>daring Thieves and Robbers</HI> of them in their be&s;t Intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>There are others who argue, that <HI>particular Churches &s;hould be ab&s;olutely &s;ubject to their own Elders or to other Churches.</HI> But to this the An&s;wer is ea&s;y, to wit, that <HI>particular Churches have an undoubted Liberty to act within them&s;elves.</HI> Now will you &s;ay, that they <HI>derived this Liberty either from their own Elders or from Neigh|bouring Chri&s;tian Societies?</HI> How can you &s;ay from the <HI>former,</HI> when it was <HI>in the Power of the Churches to chu&s;e</HI> their Elders and they exerci&s;ed their Liberty in the Choice of them? So that <HI>the Churches</HI> could not derive their Power and Liberty from their <HI>Elders;</HI> becau&s;e, before they had their <HI>Elders,</HI> they were <HI>in the rightful Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this Power and Liberty, and &s;aw meet to ex|erci&s;e it.</HI></P>

<P>But then, what &s;hall we &s;ay to our <HI>Pre&s;byterian Bre|thren,</HI> who argue that <HI>particular Churches &s;hould be de|pendant on Councils and other Judicatories and ought to be determined by them, ju&s;t as the Jewi&s;h Synagogues by the greater Sanhedrim at</HI> Jeru&s;alem?</P>
<P>We may &s;ay and &s;tand to it, that <HI>particular Churches are not beholden to Councils, Synods or any other Judica|tories</HI> for their Liberty. 'Tis true the Church of AN|TIOCH <HI>borrowed Light</HI> from the Synod at JERUSALEM,
<PB N="19" REF="004275_0036_100431D557F266D0">and by the Decrees of that Synod were <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed in Truth and Peace:</HI> But it cannot be made to appear, that <HI>they derived any Liberty at all</HI> from them. No! They had undoubtedly <HI>the Power and Liberty of acting within them&s;elves.</HI> They might indeed in an emergent Ca&s;e &s;end to JERUSALEM for <HI>Advice and A&s;&s;i&s;tance:</HI> But <HI>this &s;ending</HI> there will neither prove <HI>any Juri&s;diction</HI> in the JERUSALEM Churches over the Church of AN|TIOCH, nor any <HI>Want of Juri&s;diction</HI> in the Church of ANTIOCH. Any Number of Men or any Council or Synod of Churches may <HI>doctrinally</HI> propo&s;e Rules as nece&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved; but yet they may not claim any Authority <HI>in a Di&s;ciplinary Way to puni&s;h</HI> tho&s;e that will not conform to tho&s;e Rules: And therefore, altho' <HI>a Power of explaining and confirming Doctrines</HI> according to the <HI>Scriptures</HI> might be allowed to be in a Council or Synod, this will not prove that they have <HI>any further Authority in a Di&s;ciplinary Way</HI> to enforce their Decrees on particular Churches: Nor indeed has the Word of GOD granted to any Councils or Synods or other Ju|dicatories any &s;uch Juri&s;diction over particular Churches.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> Brethren will probably &s;ay here, <HI>What! Shall particular Churches be dependant upon no Judicatories? Why may they not depend on Councils and Synods and other Judicatories? The Jewi&s;h</HI> Synagogues <HI>depended on the</HI> Sanhedrim <HI>at</HI> Jeru&s;alem: <HI>And why &s;hould not</HI> Chri&s;tian Synagogues <HI>acknowledge the Juri&s;|diction of neighbouring Pre&s;byteries,</HI> of provincial Synods, of national Conventions and General A&s;&s;emblies?</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, that, &s;uppo&s;ing the <HI>Synagogues</HI> or particular Congregations in <HI>I&s;rael</HI> did depend upon a <HI>&s;uperior Judi|catory,</HI> it will not therefore follow that <HI>particular Chri&s;tian Congregations &s;hould do &s;o too:</HI> And the Rea&s;on is very plain and obvious, nor is it ea&s;y to enervate it, name|ly, becau&s;e <HI>particular Synagogues or Congregations</HI> then <HI>were not complete Churches, as Chri&s;tian particular Chur|ches</HI> now <HI>are:</HI> For the People <HI>could not have the ordi|nary and continual Wor&s;hip and Ordinances of GOD</HI> in
<PB N="20" REF="004275_0037_100431D80E0E1948">them; but they were obliged to go up to <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> that &s;o they might attend and enjoy them: Nay they were &s;trictly commanded <HI>not to keep the Pa&s;&s;over nor to bring any Sacrifices and Offerings onely at</HI> Jeru&s;alem, the Place which GOD had cho&s;en for the &s;pecial Seat of His Pre&s;ence: But now where is our <HI>Jeru&s;alem?</HI> We know of none but <HI>that which is above,</HI> the Mother of us all.</P>
<P>And, as for <HI>Chri&s;tian Churches,</HI> They are entirely dif|ferent Things from the <HI>Jewi&s;h Synagogues:</HI> For all the ordinary Wor&s;hip and all the &s;pecial Ordinances of GOD our SAVIOUR may now be enjoyed in <HI>particular Churches:</HI> And this &s;hews them to be <HI>perfect and en|tire</HI> within them&s;elves: And in Truth there is nothing to be found in all the New Te&s;tament of <HI>any greater Church in&s;titued upon which le&s;&s;er Churches &s;hould de|pend:</HI> Nor are any Ordinances or Methods of Wor|&s;hip pre&s;cribed in it, but what may be ob&s;erved in every <HI>particular Congregation.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides; It is to be con&s;idered, that at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> there was a <HI>&s;upreme Judicatory,</HI> which had an uncon|troleable Power and from the Determinations of which there was no Appeal: So that this was the <HI>dernier Re&s;ort</HI> upon Earth: Let it be &s;o: But in the <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> we read of no &s;uch <HI>&s;upreme Judicatory:</HI> And therefore, if we once depart from a <HI>particular Church</HI> for <HI>Juri&s;diction,</HI> we &s;hall be <HI>wi&s;e beyond what is written</HI> and run wild in our Imaginations. All <HI>Juri&s;diction</HI> there|fore &s;hould be confined to <HI>particular Churches,</HI> in who&s;e Hands our SAVIOUR hath left it: Nor may any <HI>par|ticular Churches</HI> by any Act of their own or thro' their own Negligence deprive them&s;elves of this Power: For, as by &s;o doing they would betray a <HI>great Tru&s;t</HI> committted to them, &s;o they would <HI>renounce their Duty</HI> al&s;o by it: For, unle&s;s they <HI>have and keep this Juri&s;|diction</HI> within them&s;elves, they <HI>cannot faithfully di&s;charge various Duties,</HI> which are required of them by CHRIST JESUS their Lawgiver.</P>

This was the Opinion of the Fathers of <HI>New Eng|land,</HI> and indeed of <HI>all the ancient Non-Confromi&s;ts</HI> al|mo&s;t in <HI>England:</HI> So one of them in the Name of the Re&s;t has ob&s;erved; and Dr. DOWNHAM, in a Ser|mon at <HI>Lambeth,</HI> page 5th. &s;ays, <HI>They,</HI> that is, the Non-Conformi&s;ts, <HI>&s;ay, that every Pari&s;h hath &s;ufficient Authority within it &s;elf immediately derived from CHRIST for the Government of it&s;elf in all Cau&s;e Eccle&s;ia&s;tical.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;ome &s;anguine People cannot be content with &s;uch a Con&s;ociation as has bin mentioned: No!

You &s;ay then, that you would have a <HI>&s;upreme Judicatory for the final I&s;&s;uing of Cau&s;e,</HI> with a deci|&s;ive ungain&s;ayable Power for that Purpo&s;e: Very well. To this it may be an&s;wered, <HI>why may not a particular Church be this Judicatory?</HI> For indeed the new Te&s;ta|ment has not appointed any other. Whereas, according to your Opinion, we &s;hall be at a Lo&s;s forever <HI>where to find the Judicatory,</HI> which you want and for which you &s;o zealou&s;ly plead: For, from a <HI>Congregation and Cla&s;&s;is,</HI> you mu&s;t go to a <HI>Provincial Synod:</HI> And where next?

<P>You will perhaps think it enow to reply, that, <HI>un|le&s;s there be &s;tated Judicatories for the bearing of Cau&s;es,</HI> we &s;hall be continually at Uncertainties and never know in our Difficulties what &s;hall be done: But it is &s;uffi|cient An&s;wer to this to &s;ay, that <HI>particular Churches are &s;uch &s;tanding Judicatories,</HI> not of humane Appointrment but of Divine, which always are or &s;hould be ready to hear and to give Judgment in Ca&s;es that properly come before them: Whereas <HI>Synods and other Judicatories,</HI> if they had the <HI>Supreme Power</HI> lodged in their Hands, would <HI>not always be ready</HI> to con&s;ider nor yet to deter|mine, but would be both <HI>long in meeting and tedious in determining the Affairs</HI> which come before them.</P>
<P>And, in fine, I would add, in An&s;wer to any other Objection thay may remain or may po&s;&s;ibly be rai&s;ed or drawn <HI>from the Advantage of &s;uch a Supreme Judicatory as is &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;at at</HI> Jeru&s;alem: Fir&s;t of all, That it is very probable, that &s;uch a <HI>Sanhedrim,</HI> as the Friends of it &s;uppo&s;e to be derived down from Mosas in an uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion to the Fourth Century after JESUS CHRIST, tho' &s;ome &s;ay not &s;o late, <HI>is a mere Rabbinical Chimera that never had any real Exi&s;tence</HI> For the Scriptures never any where expre&s;sly mention it: Nor yet does JOSEPHUS or PHILO or any other well acquainted with the Jewi&s;h Government ever &s;peak of it in &s;uch a Manner as is u&s;ual on the&s;e Occa&s;ions There are indeed &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages in the Go&s;pels, which give us Rea&s;on to think that there was a <HI>Sambedrim</HI> to|wards the <HI>latter End of the Jewi&s;h State:</HI> But the pro|found Silence of the <HI>Times foregoing</HI> is a &s;trong Argument for not admitting any &s;uch Thing before <HI>the Babyloni&s;h Captivity:</HI> So that <HI>the Proofs</HI> of &s;uch a Supreme Judi|catory to be Divinely in&s;tituted and as &s;uch &s;ub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">i&s;&s;ively regarded may well be que&s;tioned by us; and therefore
<PB N="24" REF="004275_0041_100406436ED43860">the Argument, drawn from the &s;ame, may as to us be con&s;idered as inconclu&s;ive and frivolous.</P>
<P>But, if it &s;hould be granted you, that there was &s;uch a <HI>Sanhedrim</HI> at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> in every Re&s;pect according to your Imagination; yet we may &s;afely affirm, that, in tho&s;e <HI>particular Churches in&s;tituted by our SAVIOUR and conforming to His Directions, we have much the Ad|vantage of the</HI> Jews in that Judicatory: For now, prai&s;ed be GOD our SAVIOUR, <HI>Churches, wherein the Supreme Power upon Earth is lodged, are many:</HI> So that Chri&s;tians may have the Advantage of <HI>that</HI> Power with <HI>con&s;ide|rable Ea&s;e and Convenience:</HI> It would therefore be very &s;trange, if they were not duely <HI>apprehen&s;ive</HI> of the glo|rious Privilege enjoyed by them, and <HI>thankful</HI> to GOD their SAVIOUR for the Enjoyment of it.</P>
<P>Thus I have in a general Way pleaded for the Li|berty of the&s;e Churches and &s;hewed that they are not &s;ubject to any Judicatories nor ought to be &s;ubject to any: And, upon the whole, I am free to declare, that, &s;uppo&s;ing ever &s;o many <HI>Convocations or Synods or even General Councils were called,</HI> they would <HI>have no Juiri&s;|diction at all over the&s;e</HI> or any other particular or Con|gregational <HI>Churches:</HI> For the <HI>great Head of the Church never gave them any &s;uch Juri&s;diction,</HI> nor is it in their Power to prove that they have derived any &s;uch Juri&s;|diction from HIM: Even that worthy Pre&s;byterian Mr. RUTHERFURD him&s;elf profe&s;&s;es, the he <Q><HI>cannot &s;ee what Power of Juri&s;diction to cen&s;ure Scandals can be in a General Council</HI></Q>, and he adds, <Q><HI>there may be &s;ome merely Doctrinal Power if &s;uch a Council could be had, and that is all</HI></Q> <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rutherfurd</HI>'s due Right of Presbyteries. p. 482.</NOTE> Surely then <HI>no le&s;&s;er Judica|tories</HI> can boa&s;t of any more Power: So that, after all, <HI>the Power of Juri&s;diction</HI> mu&s;t be placed where it pro|perly belongs, to wit, <HI>in particular Churches</HI> of Divine In&s;titution, where our SAVIOUR and LORD has placed it.

<P>The&s;e <HI>particular Churches</HI> we judge to be the fir&s;t proper <HI>Subject of all Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Offices, Gifts and Powers</HI> according to CHRIST'S In&s;titution and the Primitive Pattern: For, when the Apo&s;tles had <HI>founded many Churches in &s;mall Provinces and appointed ordinary Offi|cers</HI> in them to admini&s;ter CHRIST'S Ordinances to all the Church; we find, that the&s;e Churches re&s;pectively <HI>met together</HI> in the &s;ame Place to <HI>impart the various Spi|ritual Gifts</HI> with which they were furni&s;hed and to <HI>di&s;|charge the Duties required</HI> of them: Nor can any Thing be more plain than this, that the various <HI>Gifts</HI> imparted to one particular Church and another by the HOLY SPIRIT, and the various <HI>Offices</HI> &s;u&s;tained in them were to <HI>profit withal,</HI> as the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks, or <HI>for the Good of the Hive,</HI> as his Greek &s;ignifies: And it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed, for it is as clear as the Light, that <HI>the &s;everal Duties enjoyned upon particular Churches</HI> in the Apo&s;toli|cal Writings are &s;uch both in their Nature and the Manner of complying with them that they cannot be faithfully attended and ob&s;erved but <HI>in particular Chri&s;tian Societies or Churches:</HI> So that we may well form this Conclu&s;ion, that it is <HI>the common Privilege of all other particular Churches</HI> to have various <HI>Gifts im|parted,</HI> to have the&s;e <HI>Gifts exerci&s;ed,</HI> to have <HI>Offices</HI> di&s;po&s;ed of, and <HI>Chri&s;tian Duties performed</HI> for them.</P>

<P>And what can our modern boa&s;ted Succe&s;&s;ors from the Apo&s;tles &s;ay to this? Here was an <HI>Officer,</HI> an <HI>ex|traordinary Officer,</HI> who received his Calling and extra|ordinary Authority from JESUS CHRIST HIMSELF immediately; and yet <HI>the Church,</HI> in the Pre&s;ence of the Apo&s;tles, <HI>fir&s;t appointed two Per&s;ons,</HI> and then <HI>by their common Con&s;ent and Suffrage approved the Per&s;on who&s;e Lot it was to be cho&s;en by them!</HI> Truely they might as well re&s;i&s;t the Light of EUCLID'S Elements as the Light which appears in this Matter; and, if it were <HI>as much for their Intere&s;ts,</HI> it is very probable that they would do &s;o.</P>
<P>But &s;urely, from this celebrated In&s;tance, <HI>Chri&s;tians have now &s;ufficient In&s;truction and Authority to chu&s;e their own Officers:</HI> For, if the <HI>People</HI> had a con&s;iderable Hand in the <HI>Choice of an Apo&s;tle,</HI> certainly <HI>their Right to chu&s;e ordinary Officers</HI> cannot well be di&s;puted; and, if <HI>in the Pre&s;ence of the Apo&s;tles,</HI> the <HI>People</HI> elected one into their Number, nor were excluded from this Li|berty,
<PB N="38" REF="004275_0055_1004321C72B1DFF0">nor yet abridged in it by the pre&s;ent Apo&s;tles, it would now be a bold Attempt in any to <HI>deprive them of their Liberty to chu&s;e their ordinary Officers:</HI> I &s;ay, a bold Attempt; becau&s;e all &s;uch as would <HI>deprive the People of GOD of their Liberty</HI> to chu&s;e their own Officers, and by the Exclu&s;ion or them would <HI>take this Power into their own Hands,</HI> are very a&s;&s;uming and arrogate to them&s;elves more than the Apo&s;tles of CHRIST, who&s;e Power over the Church was doubtle&s;s extraordinary.</P>
<P>This, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, was a remarkable In|&s;tance and Proof of it, that <HI>the Apo&s;tles were true and hearty Friends to the Liberties of their Chri&s;tian Bre|thren:</HI> But this is not the only In&s;tance, wherein we find them to have bin &s;o: For, when <HI>Deacons</HI> were to be appointed, they were far from taking that Affair into their own Hands; but, as we read in Act. VI. and 2, they <HI>called the whole Multitude</HI> unto them and advi&s;ed them to <HI>look out &s;even Men who might be fit for that Bu&s;ine&s;s:</HI> And upon this it follows, that <HI>the Saying plea&s;ed the whole Multitude,</HI> and accordingly <HI>they cho&s;e &s;even</HI> Per&s;ons, who&s;e Names are afterwards mentioned: And, having proceeded thus far, they then <HI>&s;et the Dea|cons</HI> elected <HI>before the Apo&s;tles,</HI> who, <HI>when they had prayed, laid their Hands upon them.</HI></P>
<P>And, that the Apo&s;tles continued to be Favourers of <HI>the People's Right to chu&s;e their Officers,</HI> may further be argued from Act. XIV. 23, where we read of the Apo&s;tles PAUL and BARNABAS <HI>ordaining Elders in every Church:</HI> For, whereas our Ver&s;ion to &s;erve a Favourite Turn renders it only <HI>ordained,</HI> it is certain that the Word &s;ignifies <HI>an Election or a li&s;ting up of Hands <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> in every Church</HI> accompanying it, as every one that has but a &s;mall Acquaintance with the <HI>Greek</HI> cannot but be &s;en&s;ible. So that, altho' we can readily allow the Truth of what the learned DU PIN ob&s;erves,
<PB N="39" REF="004275_0056_1004321DF6C4EB78">namely, <HI>that, after the Death of tho&s;e who had bin or|dained by the Apo&s;tles, the People elected <NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Du Pin.</HI> Biblioth.

<P>We &s;ee then, that the&s;e Churches have <HI>the Authority of the Apo&s;tles</HI> to countenance them in the Choice of their Officers: If therefore the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> them&s;elves would not <HI>nominate and con&s;titute Officers</HI> in the Churches, but it was <HI>their Right</HI> according to CHRIST'S Will to chu&s;e their own Officers; it mu&s;t &s;till be <HI>the Right and Liberty, of the Churches to elect their Officers:</HI> Well therefore may we &s;ay with CHRYSOSTOM <NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom.</HI> in Act. VI 5.</NOTE>, <HI>So it was then,</HI> h. e. in the Days of the Apo&s;tles, <HI>and &s;o it ought to be now.</HI></P>
<P>But, altho' the&s;e Scriptural Te&s;timonies are enow to convince us, that, as we are <HI>in the rightful Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this Liberty,</HI> we ought by all Means to keep it, nor to let it go upon any Account or Pretence what&s;oever; there are however <HI>various Rea&s;ons</HI> be&s;ides, which will &s;erve to betray the Folly and Stupidity of tho&s;e Peo|ple, that can tamely bear to be kept out of this Liberty, and at the &s;ame Time to <HI>confirm the&s;e Churches in their Re&s;olutions not to part with it.</HI></P>
<P>For it is certainly much more ju&s;t and hone&s;t, much more fit and &s;afe, that the <HI>Officers of the Church &s;hould be cho&s;en by the People,</HI> than it can be to have them <HI>nominated and appointed by any one Bi&s;hop;</HI> becau&s;e a <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> may with much more Ea&s;e be deceived and cor|rupted than an whole Church, and may be very apt to abu&s;e his arrogated Power: And it is entirely rea|&s;onable, that the Church &s;hould chu&s;e tho&s;e that are to be <HI>&s;et over them in the LORD,</HI> le&s;t otherwi&s;e <HI>ignorant, droni&s;h, wicked and contemptible Officers &s;hould be thru&s;t and impo&s;ed upon</HI> them: And it is furthermor meet; becau&s;e there is <HI>no Likelibood</HI> of it, that <HI>the People will

<P>Be&s;ides; The Remarks of the famous CALDER|WOOD are worthy to be taken into our Con&s;ideration.

<P>Now what is there of Weight to be produced again&s;t &s;uch Con&s;iderations as the&s;e? It would be impertinent to talk of <HI>an immediate Call from GOD to Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Offices:</HI> For <HI>&s;uch</HI> a Call is not now to be expected: And yet it would be very ab&s;urd to think of <HI>officiating in any Church without any Call or Invitation at all:</HI> For <HI>none</HI> may a&s;&s;ume &s;uch Honours to them&s;elves <HI>but &s;uch as are called of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>If then any &s;hould argue <HI>for others,</HI> that they &s;hould <HI>nominate and appoint Officers</HI> over the Churches, and not the Churches them&s;elves: This is what we perempto|rily deny: For we cannot find, that <HI>GOD our SAVI|OUR has given &s;uch Power to any Men,</HI> who are not of a particular Church, <HI>to appoint Officers</HI> in and over it. Nor can we by any Means allow, that <HI>a Number of Men of any particular Church,</HI> in Exclu&s;ion of the Mul|titude of their Brethren, <HI>&s;hould con&s;titute Officers</HI> in that particular Church: For we apprehend, that, in Things
<PB N="43" REF="004275_0060_100432291BB72378">which concern the whole Church, <HI>all the Church &s;hould be intere&s;ted;</HI> unle&s;s it can be made to appear, that <HI>the great Head of the Church has empowered &s;ome only</HI> to act in the Matter: Now we know and are a&s;&s;ured, that <HI>our ble&s;&s;ed SAVIOUR has not committed to any particular Per&s;ons</HI> of what&s;oever Age or Quality <HI>the Power of chu&s;ing Officers</HI> for the whole Church: Nor has He indulged the Churches with the <HI>Liberty of delegating their Power</HI> to &s;ome of their Number to chu&s;e for them: For no Part of that Power which <HI>e&s;&s;entially</HI> belongs to the Churches as &s;uch can be <HI>delegated;</HI> but every Part of &s;uch Power mu&s;t be exerci&s;ed <HI>by the whole Churches.</HI> And therefore this <HI>Power of chu&s;ing,</HI> as it belongs to the Churches <HI>e&s;&s;entially</HI> con&s;idered, mu&s;t be <HI>acted by the Bodies of particular Churches.</HI></P>
<P>There are &s;ome, who are almo&s;t ready to concede to the&s;e Things; but yet they are for <HI>excluding the People</HI> from the Election of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Officers, <HI>on the ac|count of their Incapacity and unfitne&s;s</HI> to form a right Judgment concerning Per&s;ons and to chu&s;e wi&s;ely: I remember SIXTUS SENENSIS was of this Mind; for, altho' he acknowledges, that <HI>both in the Times of the Apo&s;tles and of Pope LEO the People cho&s;e their Bi&s;hops;</HI> yet, he adds <NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sixius Senen&s;.</HI> Biblioth.

<P>Now it is very evident from the&s;e Te&s;timonies, that <HI>in the Primitive Times the Right of the Churches to chu&s;e their own Officers</HI> was acknowleged, maintained and exerci&s;ed; and that this was <HI>one of the la&s;t Things which the Enemy of the be&s;t Intere&s;ts of Mankind wickedly ra|vi&s;hed from them.</HI></P>
<P>Thus then we have <HI>Scripture, Rea&s;on and Equity, the Nature of Churches in their In&s;titution and Ends, and the Practice of the Church in the fir&s;t and &s;ome &s;ucceed|ing Ages,</HI> all con&s;piring to confirm this Privilege of the Churches to chu&s;e their own Officers: Nor can we judge any otherwi&s;e, but that <HI>the Robbing the Churches</HI> of this Privilege was great and abominable <HI>Sacrilege.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Chapter II. The Right of the&s;e Churches <HI>to ordain their Mini&s;ters</HI> &s;tated and argued.</HEAD>
<P>THE De&s;ign of this Chapter is not to deny, that, in churches which are furni&s;hed with Pre&s;by|teries, <HI>tho&s;e Pre&s;byteries may u&s;e Impo&s;ition of Hands and ordain:</HI> For this is what is readily acknowledged by the&s;e Churches.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more plain, than that the Church is before its ordinary Officers: I &s;ay its <HI>ordinary Officers,</HI> For our ble&s;&s;ed LORD might, as He actually did, <HI>or|dain Apo&s;tles,</HI> when there was yet no Evangelical Church, to <HI>di&s;ciple the Nations and baptize</HI> them and <HI>gather Churches</HI> out of &s;uch di&s;cipled and baptized Na|tions: But it does not appear, that the Apo&s;tles either did or could <HI>ordain any &s;tated Officers,</HI> until there were <HI>Churches formed</HI> for the Reception of them: So that we judge it an ab&s;urd and extravagant Thing, and the Whim of only &s;ome Eccle&s;ia&s;tical <HI>Don Quixots,</HI> to a&s;cribe the Continuance of the Church to the <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ive uninterrupted Ordination of Officers:</HI> For, if there were any &s;uch Thing as a <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ive uninterrupted Ordination of Officers,</HI> which there is hardly one found Prote&s;tant that can believe there is; &s;till <HI>this &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Ordination of Officers</HI> wholly and entirely depends upon the <HI>Conti|nuance of the Church,</HI> and mu&s;t be an <HI>Act of the Church;</HI> and therefore it can <HI>never be a Means of communicating Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Power to others,</HI> without which there would be an End of all Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Power, as &s;ome fondly imagine or would make us believe that they imagine, &mdash; And be&s;ides; It mu&s;t be not only a vain and idle, but
<PB N="52" REF="004275_0069_10043243E17A4C18">an impious Attempt, <HI>to derive a Succe&s;&s;ion,</HI> upon which the Being of a Church &s;hall depend, <HI>thro' the Pre&s;ence of CHRIST with the Bi&s;hops of</HI> Rome, <HI>who for an hun|dred Years together,</HI> namely from the Year 900 to the Year 1000, <HI>were Mon&s;ters for Ignorance, Lu&s;t, Pride and Luxury,</HI> as BARONIUS him&s;elf acknowledges, A. D. 912.5.8.</P>
<P>And yet there are here and there &s;ome defective Pro|te&s;tants, who are fond of their <HI>uninterrupted Line of Succe&s;&s;ion.</HI> But we may fitly enquire of them, Why there is &s;uch a Thing as a <HI>Degradation,</HI> and for what Purpo&s;e it is practi&s;ed at any Time among them? Cer|tainly you will all allow, that they, who <HI>by Schi&s;m are cut off from the Church, mu&s;t</HI> al&s;o be cut off from that Part of Apo&s;tolical Power to which they made their Preten&s;ions; and &s;o it cannot be indelibly fixed on them. And &s;urely, where <HI>no Part of the Apo&s;tolical Power</HI> can be claimed, there can be <HI>no Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> to it. Now, in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> it has bin proved by ONUPHRIUS an Hi&s;torian of their own, that there have bin at lea&s;t <HI>Thirty Schi&s;ms,</HI> by &s;everal, &s;ometimes no le&s;s than <HI>&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> or &s;ix</HI> at once, pretending to the Pope|dom: And one of the Schi&s;ms la&s;ted more than <HI>Fifty Years,</HI> when one Pope &s;at at <HI>Rome,</HI> another at <HI>Avignon:</HI> Nay BELLARMINE is obliged to acknowlege, that, for above <HI>Eighty Years</HI> together, the Church for want of a <HI>lawful Pope</HI> had no other Head than what was in Heaven. And, if <HI>Schi&s;m de&s;troys the Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> of A|po&s;tolical Power, certainly <HI>damnable Here&s;y, Devili&s;m and Athei&s;m will al&s;o do it.</HI> Now what can be &s;aid to the Complaints of BARONIUS about the End of the Ninth Century, <HI>How deformed,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>was the Romi&s;h Church, when Whores no le&s;s powerful than vile bore the chief Sway at Rome, and at their Plea&s;ure changed Sees and appointed Bi&s;hops, and which is horrible to mention, did thru&s;t their own Gallants into the See of Saint</HI> Peter. There cannot therefore be any Thing more evi|dent than that <HI>the Succe&s;&s;ion has failed,</HI> tho' indeed, if
<PB N="53" REF="004275_0070_10043248F85AB648">it were not &s;o, the <HI>uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion can never be proved.</HI></P>
<P>But there are &s;ome, who, tho' they could never find in their Hearts to believe the mad Whim of <HI>Papal Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> and a <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ive Ordination,</HI> yet, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h an Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Juri&s;diction or Government, are for <HI>giving the Power of Ordination into the Hands of the Bi&s;hop or of a Synod:</HI> But it is to be hoped, that the&s;e Churches will know better than to <HI>give &s;uch an ine&s;timable Branch of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Power out of their own Hands</HI> into the Hands of others, who ought not to have it, and who in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it have always made the wor&s;t U&s;e of it.</P>
<P>The&s;e Churches are far from di&s;owning, that, <HI>when a particular Church has Elders of its own, the&s;e Elders by the Impo&s;ition of Hands may ordain &s;uch other Officers,</HI> as that Church may &s;ee Cau&s;e to elect: But our <HI>Epi&s;|copal and Pre&s;byterian Brethren</HI> &s;till in&s;i&s;t upon it, that <HI>Ordination is a Part of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Juri&s;diction, to be di&s;pen&s;ed, by the Bi&s;hop,</HI> &s;ay the former, <HI>by the Elder&s;hip and that con&s;ociated,</HI> &s;ay the latter.</P>
<P>It is evident, nor has any one yet bin able to prove to the contrary, that TIMOTHY was <HI>ordained by the Pre&s;bytery,</HI> not by any particular <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> alone: And, for ought that yet appears, <HI>the Pre&s;bytery</HI> which laid Hands upon that Evangeli&s;t, might be <HI>the Pre&s;bytery of a particular Church,</HI> and not of a Synod or inferior Cla&s;&s;is: Ney it is very probable, that <HI>it was the Pre&s;|bytery of a particular Church:</HI> For, altho' PAUL and BARNABAS were <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> yet they were not ordained [that is to &s;ay, <HI>if they were ordained</HI>] <HI>by any Cla&s;&s;is or Pre&s;byterial Synod,</HI> nor yet by one <HI>&s;ingle Per&s;on;</HI> but <HI>by the Pre&s;bytery of one particular Church,</HI> namely the Church at <HI>Antioch.</HI></P>
<P>But you will enquire, it is very likely, how it ap|pears that the <HI>Elder&s;hip,</HI> in Act. XIII, which ordained PAUL and BARNABAS, was but <HI>the Pre&s;bytery of one particular Congregation?</HI> And I an&s;er, that this is
<PB N="54" REF="004275_0071_1004324A82758FF8">plain from Act. XIV. 27, which clearly repre&s;ents to us, that the Church of <HI>Antioch</HI> was not &s;o great but that it could <HI>a&s;&s;emble in one Place;</HI> and, that <HI>the whole Multitude at the Return of</HI> PAUL and BARNABAS <HI>from the Synod at</HI> Jeru&s;alem <HI>met together to hear the Epi&s;tle which that Synod had &s;ent them,</HI> this is very ma|nife&s;t from Act. XV. 30 and 31. Now therefore the Conclu&s;ion mu&s;t be this, that, the Church at <HI>Antioch</HI> being but <HI>one particular Church, the Pre&s;butery,</HI> by which PAUL and BARNABAS were ordained, could not be a <HI>Synodical Pre&s;bytery,</HI> but <HI>the Pre&s;bytery of a particular Church.</HI></P>
<P>There is, I confe&s;s, a con&s;iderable Noi&s;e made both by our <HI>Pre&s;byterian and Epi&s;copal Brethren</HI> about the Epi&s;tles to TIMOTHY and TITUS: For, while the <HI>former</HI> are endeavouring to <HI>&s;upport and e&s;tabli&s;h their beloved Cla&s;&s;es and Synods from</HI> TIMOTHY'S <HI>Ordination;</HI> the <HI>latter</HI> continue to in&s;i&s;t upon it, that <HI>the&s;e Epi&s;tles are purely Epi&s;copal:</HI> But the be&s;t Con&s;truction, which can be made of tho&s;e Epi&s;tles is plainly this; to wit, that they were <HI>not de&s;igned for tho&s;e Evangeli&s;ts alone, nor any Mini&s;ters alone, but for a State that was mixed,</HI> wherein <HI>the &s;aid Evangeli&s;ts,</HI> having &s;ome <HI>a&s;&s;i&s;ting Pre&s;|byters</HI> or other Officers, <HI>admini&s;tred and executed the Affairs of the Agreement of the People:</HI> For, altho' the Epi&s;tles be written <HI>by Name,</HI> and &s;ay <HI>e&s;pecially,</HI> to TIMOTHY and TITUS; &s;till there can be no Que&s;tion but that they were <HI>really intended for general U&s;e and Advantage:</HI> And this is what we may fairly conclude from the Apo&s;tle's Wi&s;h, <HI>Grace be with you, Grace be with you</HI> all, which clo&s;es one Epi&s;tle and another: For it cannot be well imagined, that the&s;e Wi&s;hes are only belogning to the <HI>Evangeli&s;ts,</HI> to whom the Epi&s;tles are directed. Why then &s;hould it be conceeded to our Brethren of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> that the Apo&s;tle writes his three Epi&s;tles to two Arch-Bi&s;hops or <HI>Me|trapolitans;</HI> e&s;pecially when, as the famous CALDER|WOOD
<PB N="55" REF="004275_0072_1004324D4364A700">ob&s;erves, <HI>there is not &s;o much as one Thing in&s;ert|ed in them that can properly &s;erve the Arch-Bi&s;hop or Metropolitan?</HI> For, adds he, here are <HI>no Apo&s;tolical Monitions about convoking Synods of Bi&s;hops, concerning Con&s;ecrations of Bi&s;hops, concerning the Correction of the Defects and Exce&s;&s;es of Prelates, and receiving Appeals from Epi&s;copal Con&s;i&s;tories; altho' the&s;e,</HI> according to your Hierarchical Gentlemen, <HI>are the chief Offices of Arch-Bi&s;hops <NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Didoclav.</HI> Altar.

If it were actually declared in them, that in <HI>Crete</HI> and at <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> there were <HI>Pre&s;by|tertes;</HI> yet where do we read of the <HI>Powers to be claimed by the&s;e</HI> Pre&s;byteries or the <HI>Subjection of the&s;e Pre&s;by|teries</HI> to other and &s;uperior Judicatories?</P>
<P>As to tho&s;e, who confidently report, that <HI>Ordination cannot be validly and lawfully performed</HI> but by a Bi&s;hop; we think it a &s;ufficient An&s;wer to &s;ay, that we find the fir&s;t Mention of a <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> di&s;tinct from <HI>Pre&s;byters</HI> to have bin about <HI>Three Hundred Years after our</HI> SA|VIOUR: And this is no more than what many of the more &s;ober and con&s;iderate of the <HI>Epi&s;copalian Writers</HI> are free to acknowlege: And we conceive, that even <HI>then,</HI> for ought that the Friends of Dioce&s;an Epi&s;|copacy have bin able to prove to the contrary, there was <HI>no Bi&s;hop who had any Juri&s;diction or Authority over other Mini&s;ters, but who in common with other Mini&s;ters ruled and governed the Churches</HI> according to their Con|&s;ent and Agreement.</P>
<P>But, if for Argument's &s;ake it &s;hould be allowed, that the <HI>Bi&s;hop was a di&s;tinct Order from the Pre&s;byter;</HI> &s;till this will be no Demon&s;tration, that <HI>the Bi&s;hop alone has the Power of ordaining:</HI> How then &s;hall we be made &s;en&s;ible of it, that the <HI>Bi&s;hop alone &s;hould have this Power?</HI> Alas! <HI>Confident A&s;&s;ertions</HI> of a Thing
<PB N="56" REF="004275_0073_100432539BCB3FE8">will never convince us concerning the Truth of it, e&s;pe|cially of &s;uch a Thing as this which can never be proved: For <HI>in the whole New Te&s;tament there is not &s;o much as one In&s;tance of an Ordination that was per|formed by a &s;ingle Per&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>Let us therefore turn to our <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> Friends and attend to what they have ot offer: Now they are ready to object and &s;ay, <HI>But,</HI> dear Brethren, <HI>where do you read of any Ordinations but by</HI> Pre&s;byters? For An&s;wer to the&s;e our entirely beloved Brethren, there is no need of referring them to the Direction, in Numb. VIII. 10, <HI>Thou &s;halt bring the</HI> Levites <HI>before the LORD, and the</HI> Children of I&s;rael <HI>&s;hall put their Hands upon the</HI> Le|vites; from which Direction &s;ome have argued, that when <HI>a Church is de&s;titute of Elders and Elders cannot conveniently be had from another Church,</HI> then <HI>Impo&s;ition of Hands</HI> may be performed by &s;ome of the <HI>con&s;idera|ble Men of the Congregation,</HI> altho' they &s;hould not be <HI>Elders;</HI> and that therefore, what was performed in the Church of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> may in the like Ca&s;e be at pre&s;ent performed.</P>
<P>But, waving this Argument, I &s;hall now remark and &s;hew, that the Ca&s;e may be &s;uch as that, <HI>if Ordination be really requi&s;ite, by the Impo&s;ition of Hands, then it way be performed by &s;uch as are not Officers at all in the Church:</HI> Now this is very clear; for <HI>the State of Things may be &s;uch, that there cannot be any Ordination at all by the Impo&s;ition of the Hands of Elders:</HI> And in &s;uch a State as this, as there are <HI>no Elders or Bi&s;hops.</HI> either there mu&s;t be <HI>no Ordination</HI> by the Impo&s;ition of Hands at all, or el&s;e <HI>the Ordination mu&s;t be performed by &s;uch as are no Officers:</HI> And, that this may be the Ca&s;e of a Church, that <HI>Ordination cannot be performed by Officers</HI> in it, this &s;hall pre&s;ently be made evident.</P>
<P>To &s;uch therefore as are of the Opinion, that <HI>Ordi|nation by Officers</HI> is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary that there is <HI>no perform|ing it without them,</HI> we may calmly addre&s;s our&s;elves and expo&s;tulate; <HI>Dear Sirs, How will you prove the
<PB N="57" REF="004275_0074_100432569423AF78">Nece&s;&s;ity of Ordination</HI> for Elders or Bi&s;hops? And, if you will have it nece&s;&s;ary, I pray, <HI>what &s;hall be done where there are no Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Officers to be had?</HI> For this may be <HI>the Ca&s;e of a Society of Chri&s;tians</HI> by Ship|wreck thrown upon a Place where there are <HI>no Elders;</HI> &s;ay, upon the I&s;land of <HI>Bermuda,</HI> which erects its &s;oli|tary Head in the <HI>Atlantic</HI> at a Di&s;tance from other Pla|ces: Suppo&s;e in this Ca&s;e Mr. PAUL &s;hould providen|tially come among them, who had never bin &s;eparated to the Evangelical Mini&s;try; might he not teach and in&s;truct them in the Principles of Chri&s;tianity? And, if <HI>Ordination were nece&s;&s;ary</HI> in order to his Di&s;pen&s;ation of the Word and Ordinances, might not the <HI>poor Ship|wreck'd Chri&s;tians properly ordain him and &s;eparate him by the Impo&s;ition of Hands to the Work of the Mini&s;try?</HI> or, which to me is the &s;ame Thing, <HI>by the laying on of their Hands, commend him to the Grace of GOD in that Work to which they have called him?</HI> Truely it is very plain to me that they might. This is certain, that, at the Beginning of the Reformation in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the old Manner of <HI>electing and ordaining Mini&s;ters was perform'd without Impo&s;ition of Hands,</HI> as may be &s;een in KNOX'S Forms prefix'd to the old <HI>P&s;alms:</HI> And the ingenious STEUART, in the Fourteenth Page of his <HI>Collections,</HI> affirms this Ordination was <HI>lawful and valid.</HI> If there|fore it &s;hould be thought <HI>too much</HI> for Brethren cho&s;en to it <HI>to impo&s;e Hands</HI> on elected Officers; certainly we may <HI>claim the electing and ordaining Power</HI> for the Bre|thren without it. And this is what all Men would &s;oon di&s;cover, if it were not for <HI>the Intere&s;t of &s;ome worldly minded Per&s;ons</HI> to entangle the Sentiments of Mankind and lead them a&s;ide.</P>
<P><HI>Antiquity</HI> is no Stranger to &s;uch an Opinion as ours: For FRUMENTIUS, who was <HI>not in holy Orders,</HI> went and preach'd to the <HI>Indians,</HI> and afterwards was made a Prie&s;t and Bi&s;hop by ATHANASIUS: But no one that I know of ever faulted his Conduct: Nor has the King of the <HI>Iberians</HI> bin condemned, altho' <HI>before be was or|dained

<P>And this leads me to demand, <HI>how we &s;hall do, if we cannot improve the Officers, which we may obtain, to con|fer holy Orders?</HI> For it &s;ometimes happens, that, <HI>where
<PB N="59" REF="004275_0076_10043295F3E28438">Officers may be had</HI> to perform this Service, <HI>tho&s;e Officers,</HI> as well as the <HI>Churches</HI> to which they belong, may be &s;o very corrupt or wicked that it would be <HI>better not to improve</HI> them: And therefore we need not be afraid or a&s;hamed to declare, that, if our Churches here can have no Mini&s;ters but what mu&s;t be <HI>ordained by Popi&s;h Bi&s;hops,</HI> the Ca&s;e appears to us as &s;orrowful, as if the poor <HI>Sheep</HI> in the Wilderne&s;s could have none but <HI>Wolves</HI> to appoint <HI>Shepherds</HI> over them: Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, this is not the Ca&s;e with the&s;e Churches.&mdash; But let the Ca&s;e be imagined, that there may be a general <HI>Combination of degenerate Pa&s;tors</HI> in a Countrey, who will be for <HI>di&s;pen&s;ing Ordination to none but &s;uch as will partake with them in their Degeneracy or &s;ubmit unto &s;in|ful Terms;</HI> where a <HI>particular Church</HI> is de&s;irous to have all Things <HI>according to the Pattern in the Mount:</HI> Now in this Ca&s;e would not <HI>the making the Impo&s;ition of Hands</HI> from &s;uch Mini&s;ters as have bin them&s;elves ordained, <HI>to be e&s;&s;ential to the Call</HI> of a Mini&s;ter, be <HI>a Piece of fooli&s;h Bigotry,</HI> to which no &s;ound Prote&s;tant can &s;afely and prudently &s;ub&s;cribe? Truely it &s;eems to be &s;o. And we are &s;ure, that BEZA, in the famous Conference at <HI>Poi&s;&s;y,</HI> clearly and fully renounced &s;uch an <HI>en&s;naring Opinion,</HI> and maintain'd, that <Q><HI>unto a legitimate Call Impo&s;ition of Hands was not nece&s;&s;ary;</HI> but that the <HI>chief and &s;ub&s;tantial Tokens</HI> thereof <HI>were a good Life, &s;ound Doctrine and Election</HI> [from the People:] Nor was it to be wondred at, if the <HI>Reformed</HI> had not re|ceived Impo&s;ition of Hands from them, who&s;e cor|rupt Life, Super&s;tition and fal&s;e Doctrine they were to reprove? Or how could it be expected, they <HI>&s;hould ever be allwed</HI> of by them, who were Enemies to the Truth which they defended?</Q></P>
<P>And, in fine, I would enquire of the Patrons of Or|dination by Officers, <HI>whether even good and meet Officers,</HI> belonging to other Churches, <HI>may claim the Power of ordaining Elders over Churches to which they are not related?</HI> Tho' there may be very <HI>de&s;irable Officers</HI> and
<PB N="60" REF="004275_0077_100432920B66A7C8">in every Re&s;pect well qualified near at Hand; never, thele&s;s it does not appear, that even the&s;e <HI>have Authority or may a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves the Power of ordaining Elders to other Churches, of which they are neither Members nor Officers;</HI> unle&s;s <HI>tho&s;e particular Churches,</HI> in which the Elders are to be ordained, <HI>reque&s;t their Pre&s;ence and A&s;&s;i&s;tance:</HI> For <HI>ordinary Officers</HI> are not like the Apo&s;|tles, who might <HI>feed all the Flock</HI> of our SAVIOUR; but there is <HI>one particular Flock, of which,</HI> and of which alone, <HI>they are to take the Over&s;ight.</HI></P>
<P>If indeed it were acknowleged that we read in &s;un|dry Places of <HI>Ordination performed by Elders,</HI> tho' the Proof of this is difficult; and that <HI>we never read in the New Te&s;tament about the Performance of it by any others:</HI> This however is nothing at all again&s;t what has bin offered: For, altho' we &s;hould allow, that, in &s;uch Churches as are furni&s;hed with <HI>Elders, Ordination &s;hould be performed by tho&s;e</HI> Elders; we may neverthele&s;s with Safety maintain, that, where there are not <HI>Elders as at the fir&s;t, nor any that can be conveniently borrow'd</HI> from other Churches, <HI>Ordination by the Impo&s;ition of Hands may</HI> then <HI>be validly and lawfully performed by others.</HI> And it is no more than what a famous Bi&s;hop of <HI>Sali&s;|bury,</HI> in his <HI>Expo&s;ition on the thirty nine Articles,</HI> has freely declared: For He affirms, that, <HI>whatever &s;ome holter Spirits have &s;ince thought of it;</HI> yet not only tho&s;e who pen'd the Articles, <HI>but the Body of the Church for above half an Age afterward</HI> were of a Per&s;ua&s;ion which implied, that <HI>they thought no &s;piritual Powers ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the Exerci&s;e of the Evangelical Mini&s;try, except what the People could convey</HI> to &s;uch of their Body as they might judge qualified for it.</P>
<P>We may al&s;o be free and ready to grant, that <HI>Elders meeting in a Council or Synod,</HI> with Brethren, <HI>may at the De&s;ire of a particular Church, ordain its Officers:</HI> But then, as it has bin the Judgment of the&s;e Churches in Times pa&s;t, there is yet no good Rea&s;on why the&s;e Churches &s;hould change their Judgment, that <HI>the El|ders
<PB N="61" REF="004275_0078_10043259C3CD28E8">&s;o convened in Council or Synod with their Brethren for this Service, have no Power or Juri&s;diction of their own, but act by vertue of the Power derived from the particular Churches which &s;ent for them:</HI> So that, in &s;hort, <HI>particular Churches are the fir&s;t Subjects of this Power</HI> of ordaining; as it is <HI>for particular Churches</HI> that <HI>Councils or Synods</HI> convene, when they meet in order to <HI>ordain Officers</HI> for them.</P>
<P>The very learned FABRITIUS, the Principal Doc|tor of Divinity in the Reformed Church of the <HI>Pala|tinate,</HI> who&s;e Life is written and who&s;e Works are publi&s;hed by the great HEIDEGGER at <HI>Zurich,</HI> 1698, publi&s;hed two Dialogues in 1685, in the latter of which he endeavours to demon&s;trate that <HI>the Controver&s;y about Bapti&s;m by a private Man</HI> in Ca&s;e of Nece&s;&s;ity <HI>does not belong to the fundamental Articles of Faith, but to the Que&s;tion concerning Order,</HI> it being appointed by the Divine Law that <HI>all Things &s;hould be done in order:</HI> Which principally con&s;i&s;ts in this, that <HI>every one per|form the Duty belonging to his Charge:</HI> And therefore if any Man, even a <HI>Laic,</HI> be <HI>appointed by the Church to</HI> admini&s;ter the Sacrament, if he does it, <HI>he does nothing but his Duty and neither offends again&s;t the Faith or again&s;t good Order.</HI> The learned FABRITIUS indeed does not lay this down as of him&s;elf; but he <HI>commends both the Ancients and Moderns who are of this Opinion.</HI> And by the &s;ame Rule he would have <HI>commended &s;uch as a&s;&s;ert the Right of the Brethren to appoint &s;ome of their Number to confer Orders</HI> on Officers call'd and cho&s;en by them&s;elves; and &s;o our generous and noble Parents would have bin <HI>applauded by him for their Opinion con|cerning Ordination.</HI></P>
<P>As our Fathers tho't, that <HI>Ordination did not con&s;titute an Officer nor give him the E&s;&s;entials of his Office:</HI> For they judg'd, that <HI>the E&s;&s;ence of the outward Call of an ordinary Officer con&s;i&s;ted, not in that, but in his free Elec|tion by the Church and his Acceptance of that Choice:</HI> So they have declared their Opinion, in <HI>the Ninth Chap|ter
<PB N="62" REF="004275_0079_1004325DE6139AB8">of their Platform,</HI> that, <HI>in Churches where there are no Elders, Impo&s;ition of Hands</HI> on Officers elected <HI>may be performed by &s;ome of the Brethren orderly cho&s;en by the Church</HI> for that Servive: And the Rea&s;on which they there a&s;&s;ign for this is a good one: <HI>For,</HI> &s;ay they, <HI>if the People elect Officers which is the greater, and wherein the Sub&s;tance of the Office doth con&s;i&s;t, they may much more, Occa&s;ion and Need requiring, impo&s;e Hands in Ordina|tion, which is le&s;s, and but the Accompli&s;hment of the other.</HI> But, notwith&s;tanding the Claim of this Right for our Churches, they go on afterwards and &s;ay, in the &s;ame Chapter, <HI>Neverthele&s;s in Churches, where they have no Elders, and the Churches de&s;ire it, we &s;ee not, why Impo&s;ition of Hands may not be performed by the Elders of other Churches.</HI></P>
<P>Nor are our worthy Predece&s;&s;ors &s;ingular in the&s;e their Sentiments. The pious and learned PERKINS, writing concerning <HI>Ordination and Succe&s;&s;ion,</HI> in his Com|mentary on Gal. I. ii. &s;ays, that, <HI>if in</HI> Turkey or America, or el&s;ewhere <HI>the Go&s;pel be received of Men, by the Coun&s;el or Per&s;ua&s;ion of private Per&s;ons, they &s;hould not need to &s;end unto</HI> Europe <HI>for con&s;ecrated Mini&s;ters, but have Power to chu&s;e their own from within them|&s;elves:</HI> And his Rea&s;on is <HI>becau&s;e, where GOD gives the Word, He gives Power al&s;o.</HI> And PHILIP ME|LANCTHON, the gracious and excellent, expre&s;&s;es him|&s;elf much after the &s;ame Manner in his <HI>An&s;wer to the</HI> Bohemian <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> who taught the incorrupt Doctrine of the Go&s;pel, and refutes <HI>the Pretent of Ordination to be taken from Bi&s;hops</HI> from the fir&s;t Chapter of the Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Galatians.</HI> And the Author of the va|luable <HI>Scotch Di&s;pute again&s;t Engli&s;h Ceremonies,</HI> freely declares, in pag. 285th, that, as, <HI>when Princes are elec|ted, the Election gives them</HI> Jus ad Rem, <HI>as they &s;peak, without which the Inauguration can never give them</HI> Jus in Re; <HI>&s;o it is as to a</HI> Mini&s;ter: <HI>And</HI> Ordination <HI>only applied him to the actual exerci&s;ing of his Pa&s;toral Office; which</HI> Ordination <HI>&s;hould be given to him alone that is
<PB N="63" REF="004275_0080_10040657B5A012B8">elected, and that</HI> becau&s;e he is &s;o. And the learned VOET, in his <HI>De&s;perat. Cau&s;. Papat.</HI> L. II. Sect. II. Cap. XX, has irrefragably proved again&s;t JANSENIUS, <HI>Electionem tribuere Mini&s;terium,</HI> that it is <HI>the Choice which makes the Mini&s;ter,</HI> by &s;ix or &s;even Arguments. Now, from the&s;e declared Sentiments of &s;uch eminent Per&s;ons, it appears very plain to me, that the Tho'ts of our Predece&s;&s;ors may be clear'd from the Charge of Singularity, and with Ea&s;e be &s;upported and ju&s;tified.</P>
<P>Nay I cannot but think, that even Arch-Bi&s;hop BANCROFT has furni&s;hed us with a good Argument in Favour of the Opinion maintain'd by our Ance&s;tors: For, before the Con&s;ecration of the three Scotch Bi&s;hops at <HI>London,</HI> ANDREWS the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Ely</HI> &s;aid, <HI>They mu&s;t fir&s;t be ordained as having received no Ordination by a</HI> Bi&s;hop: But BANCROFT maintain'd, that <HI>there was no Nece&s;&s;ity for it, &s;eeing, where Bi&s;hops could not be had, the Ordination given by Pre&s;byters mu&s;t be valid and e&s;teemed lawful: For otherwi&s;e it might be doubted, if there was any lawful Vocation in mo&s;t of the Reformed Churches.</HI> Now, by the &s;ame Argument of BAN|CROFT'S, (which is to be found in SPOTSWOOD'S Hi&s;t. l. 7. p. 514.) there will be no Difficulty in maintain|ing <HI>the Validity and Lawfulne&s;s of Ordination by the Peo|ple:</HI> For, where Bi&s;hops or Pre&s;byters cannot be had, Ordinations by them mu&s;t be <HI>valid and e&s;teemed law|ful: Otherwi&s;e it may be doubted whether there be any lawful Vocation in many, if not mo&s;t, of the Reformed Churches.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore I cannot but &s;ay with the celebrated Mr. CLAUDE, that <HI>the fierce Opinion that goes &s;o high as to own no Mini&s;try in the World, but where there are</HI> Epi&s;|copal Ordinations, <HI>and which would make all Religion depend on a di&s;putable Formality; that Opinion can't be look'd upon any otherwi&s;e than the very wor&s;t Character and the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Mark of Hypocri&s;y and worthy of Con|tempt from all the Chri&s;tians in the World.</HI> But what he has thus &s;trongly, but ju&s;tly, expre&s;&s;ed concerning
<PB N="64" REF="004275_0081_10043262F7711D80">the hot Opinion about the <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity of Epi&s;copal Ordi|nations;</HI> I would &s;ay and maintain the very &s;ame con|cerning the Opinion about <HI>the Nece&s;&s;ity of Ordination by</HI> as Pre&s;bytery, as well as a Bi&s;hop: And it will give me very little Unea&s;ine&s;s, however vex'd and angry or troubled any may be with me for being of this Mind and freely declaring it: For I am &s;atisfied, that their Trouble or Anger mu&s;t ari&s;e either from groundle&s;s Fancies or &s;omething wor&s;e: So that I cannot have any Rea&s;on to be di&s;turb'd or unea&s;y at it.</P>
<P>But, after all, &s;ome will challenge us to produce any <HI>Texts of Scripture that give Laymen a Right to ordain Mini&s;ters in any Ca&s;e.</HI> And, as this is the Challenge which the Author of <HI>The Prejudices,</HI> &amp;c. made to the famous Mr. CLAUDE, I &s;hall recite his Reply to it, which to me appears a full and &s;ufficient one: It is to be found in his <HI>Defence of the Reformation,</HI> P. IV. p. 94 and 95.</P>
<P><Q>This Demand, &s;ays he, is but a vain Wrangling. For, when the Scripture recommends to the Faithful the taking diligent heed to the Pre&s;ervation and Con|firmation of their Faith and to propagate it to their Children; it gives them by that very Thing a &s;uffi|cient <HI>Right to make U&s;e of all proper Means to that End:</HI> And every Body knows the Mini&s;try is one of tho&s;e Means: And therefore the Obligation the Faithful are under to pre&s;erve and propagate the Faith includes <HI>that of creating to them&s;elves Pa&s;tors</HI> when they cannot have them otherwi&s;e: In &s;hort, when the Scripture teaches, that the Faithful have a Right to chu&s;e their Pa&s;tors, it teaches thereby that they have a Right to in&s;tall them in their Office in Ca&s;e of Nece&s;&s;ity: For that <HI>Call con&s;i&s;ting much more e&s;&s;entially in Election than in In&s;tallation,</HI> which is but a Formality, there is no Rea&s;on to believe, that GOD would have given the People a Right to chu&s;e their Pa&s;tors and to have them in&s;talled by others, and that He has not given them at the &s;ame Time <HI>a

<HEAD><HI>Chapter III. The Right of the&s;e Churches</HI> to &s;end forth their Elders and other Delegates upon proper Occa&s;ions, and to call them to an Account upon their Return <HI>main|tained..</HI></HEAD>
<P>AS <HI>Churches</HI> cannot with Convenience repair to di&s;tant Places upon recurring Occa&s;ions; it is for this Rea&s;on requi&s;ite and nece&s;&s;ary, that on &s;uch Occa&s;ions they &s;hould u&s;e the <HI>vicarious Help of others.</HI> And, as every particular Church, that hath <HI>Elders</HI> and other Members adorned with mental and gracious Qua|lifications fitting them for public Service, hath an un|doubted <HI>Right to improve</HI> and make U&s;e of them in the be&s;t Manner and on the be&s;t Occa&s;ions; &s;o, if <HI>the Honour of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord and the Welfare of any of the Churches</HI> require it, they have then <HI>the Liberty of in|&s;tructing and &s;ending forth</HI> their Elders and other Dele|gates.</P>
<P>Thus it was unque&s;tionably in ancient Times: For the Brethren of the Church at <HI>Antioch</HI> determined that PAUL. and BARNABAS and <HI>certain others &s;hould go up to</HI> Jeru&s;alem <HI>to con&s;ult the Apo&s;tles, Elders and Brethren</HI> there.

<P>And, that the Churches continued afterwards to claim this Right, it will abundantly appear from CLEMENT'S fir&s;t Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Corinthians:</HI> For this Epi&s;tle, which weareth his honourable Name, was &s;ent by the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> unto the <HI>Corinthians</HI> by CLAUDIUS, EPHE|BUS, VALERIUS, BIBO, FORTUNATUS, who were <HI>their Apo&s;tles</HI> <NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">vid. <HI>Clement.</HI> Epi&s;t. ad Corinth.</NOTE> or Me&s;&s;engers to the Church at <HI>Co|rinth:</HI> And the&s;e Per&s;ons, you mu&s;t know, were <HI>not Officers</HI> in the Church at that Time, nor appear to be mention'd at all under that Character; but they were <HI>prudent and &s;it Members</HI> of that Chri&s;tian Community to be &s;ent with this Epi&s;tle and act in Behalf of the Church of ROME: It follows therefore, that, as <HI>this Letter</HI> was &s;ent by the Church and <HI>the&s;e Me&s;&s;engers</HI> were appointed and di&s;patch'd <HI>in the Name of the Church</HI> with it, the Church mu&s;t be heartily con&s;enting unto the <HI>&s;ending of the Letter and the Me&s;&s;engers;</HI> and that there|fore <HI>the Church mu&s;t meet together;</HI> for, without <HI>this,</HI> how could they <HI>con&s;ent to the &s;ending Letter or Me&s;&s;en|gers to the Church of the Corinthians?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Particular Churches</HI> then are po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of this Right and Privilege of appointing and &s;ending forth Elders and other Delegates on &s;uitable Occa&s;ions: And by the
<PB N="75" REF="004275_0092_10040652D8419C28">&s;ame Rea&s;on they may <HI>call them to an Account at their Return:</HI> And, if upon Enquiry it &s;hall be found, that they have done any Thing prejudicial to the Truth and Peace of the Go&s;pel, they may ju&s;tly <HI>expo&s;tulate</HI> with them and a&s;k the Rea&s;ons of their Conduct and refu&s;e to regard what they have bin doing.</P>
<P>Nor indeed can any Thing be more fit and &s;uitable than this, that the Me&s;&s;engers of particular Churches, who have <HI>done ami&s;s,</HI> or <HI>ly under the Su&s;picion</HI> of irregu|lar Conduct and a faulty Management of their Affairs, &s;hould be que&s;tioned by the Churches, who&s;e Me&s;&s;en|gers they are, and in who&s;e Service they are em|ploy'd.</P>
<P>And as this is <HI>fit and &s;uitable in it&s;elf,</HI> that the Bre|thren in particular Churches &s;hould call their Delegates to an Account for their Management in their Service; there is al&s;o an <HI>In&s;tance</HI> to be given from <HI>the Scripture,</HI> which will &s;ufficiently ju&s;tify the Brethren in the U&s;e of this Liberty: It is in Act.

<P>Now, if the Brethren might demand of an Apo&s;tle the Rea&s;ons of his Behaviour, and if the Apo&s;tle tho't him&s;elf accountable to them and therefore oblig'd to apologize for his Conduct before them; the Conclu&s;ion is &s;trong and irre&s;i&s;table, that now <HI>the Brethren have the Liberty much more</HI> to enquire concerning the Manage|ments of their Elders and other Delegates whom they improve, and to require Satisfaction of them concerning any Breaches of Rule into which they may be be|tray'd; and <HI>Elders and other Me&s;&s;engers are now much more obliged</HI> to render them an Account and &s;atisfy them, when they properly and hone&s;tly demand that

<P>IT has bin a&s;&s;erted and proved, that <HI>Elders,</HI> as well other Delegates, are <HI>accountable to the particular Churches</HI> who employ them: But &s;ome may probably here enquire, <HI>Suppo&s;ing the Elders of a particular Church &s;hould be guilty of Male-Admini&s;tration, what is then to be done?

<P>I an&s;wer, as our wi&s;e and pious Fathers have alrea|dy an&s;wered, that, altho' <HI>Church-Government</HI> or Rule be placed by CHRIST JESUS our LORD <HI>in the Officers of the Church, who therefore may be called</HI> Rulers <HI>while they rule with GOD; yet, in Ca&s;e of Male-Admini&s;tra|tion, they are &s;ubject to the Power of the Church <NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">Platform of Church Di&s;cipline.

<P>That the Power of the Church extends to the <HI>De|po&s;ition of their Elders,</HI>&mdash;This &s;eems to be a pretty ma|nife&s;t Ca&s;e: For, <HI>if the Church have Power to chu&s;e their Officers and Mini&s;ters; then, in Ca&s;e of manife&s;t Unworthine&s;s and Delinquency, they have Power al&s;o to depo&s;e them: For to open and &s;hut, to chu&s;e and refu&s;e, to con&s;titute in Office and remove from Office are Acts be|longing

<P>Nor indeed can it well be di&s;puted, that the Churches in the Days of primitive Chri&s;tianity were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this mo&s;t valuable Right and Privilege; when there are &s;uch Te&s;timonies in the ancient approved Writers, which fully demon&s;trate it.</P>
<P>It is as clear as the Light from that de&s;ervedly priz'd Remain of Antiquity, CLEMRNT'S fir&s;t Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> which is worthy of frequent Citations from it, that <HI>the Church of</HI> Corinth <HI>at that Time had and exer|ci&s;ed this Privilege:</HI> For, he &s;ays to them in that

<P>And it is al&s;o certain, that the particular Churches of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, enjoy'd this Privilege, at lea&s;t until the <HI>two hundred and fifty eighth Year</HI> after CHRIST: For, in that Year, a Synod convened, in which CYPRIAN pre&s;ided: And that Synod approv'd and commended the Proceedings of &s;ome Churches who had depo&s;ed their Bi&s;hops, upon the Application of tho&s;e Churches to the Synod in order to obtain their Opinion concerning their Conduct.</P>
<P>As for CYPRIAN'S own Judgment in this Matter it may ea&s;ily be &s;een by reading &s;ome of his Epi&s;tles: For, in one of his Epi&s;tles, he expre&s;ly acknowleges that in his Time <HI>the People had the Power, as of chu&s;ing worthy Mini&s;ters, &s;o</HI> likewi&s;e <HI>of refu&s;ing and ca&s;ting off tho&s;e who were not &s;o <NOTE N="(v)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cyptian.</HI> Epi&s;t. 4.</NOTE>;</HI> and in another Epi&s;tle, he
<PB N="83" REF="004275_0100_100432DC548DEAC8">affirms, <HI>that this Power belongs to the Church, and that it was given to the Church by Divine Authority <NOTE N="(w)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cyprian.</HI> Epi&s;t. 68.</NOTE>.</HI></P>
<P>And the learned ORIGEN was of the &s;ame Mind: For he freely declar'd to his People, <HI>If I &s;eem to you to be a</HI> right Hand, <HI>and am call'd a Pre&s;byter and &s;eem to preach the Word of GOD; yet, if I &s;hall do any Thing contrary to Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Di&s;cipline and the Rule of the Go&s;pel, &s;o that I give Scandal or Offence to the Church, let the whole Church con&s;pire and with one Con&s;ent cut me off, altho' I am their Right Hand <NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Origen.</HI> in Joh. Cap. VII.</NOTE>.</HI></P>
<P>But, if for the &s;ake of Peace it &s;hould be granted, that <HI>this Power is too great for the Brethren,</HI> and that they have not &s;ufficient Authority for it; may we not then &s;ay, that <HI>they may withdraw from their Male-ad|mini&s;tring Elders,</HI> and that there cannot be any rea&s;ona|ble Objection again&s;t &s;uch a Withdraw from them? Truely we may well &s;ay this, and it may very well be granted us; For, as every particular Church <HI>&s;ets up their Pre&s;bytery by profe&s;&s;ing their Subjection</HI> to them in the LORD; even &s;o, when they <HI>walk di&s;orderly in their Office and are chargeable with Male-Admini&s;tration</HI> in it, then they may <HI>avoid them and profe&s;&s;edly withdraw their Subjection to them:</HI> So that, if according to the Opinion of &s;ome, the Brethren &s;hould <HI>not have the Power of depo&s;ing their Elders;</HI> yet, if they have <HI>the Power and Liberty of withdrawing from them</HI> on requi&s;ite Occa&s;i|ons, which cannot be denied them, they have what is tantamount to the <HI>Depo&s;ing Power, at lea&s;t with re&s;pect to them&s;elves.</HI></P>
<P>And, that <HI>the Churches have this Pewer and Liberty,</HI> we may &s;afely argue from our Apo&s;tle's In&s;truction to the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> in Rom. XVI. 17. where he <HI>be&s;eeches</HI> them to <HI>mark &s;uch as cau&s;e Divi&s;ions, &mdash;and avoid them,</HI> or withdraw from them: For, our Apo&s;tle, fore&s;eeing by the Holy SPIRIT enlightning him, the

<P>The Things, which we judge requi&s;ite, ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite, in all tho&s;e that would enjoy the Communion in the&s;e Churches, are <HI>Repentance towards GOD, and Faith towards our LORD JESUS CHRIST, and a fixed Re&s;olution to lead a Life of Piety and Vertue:</HI> And we think, that &s;uch as are <HI>&s;incere</HI> in the&s;e Things, altho' they &s;hould be but weak Chri&s;tians, <HI>but Babes in CHRIST <NOTE N="(&amp;)" PLACE="foot"><HI>I have heard or read &s;omewhere, that my great Grand|father, the holy and learned Mr. COTTON, once &s;aid to his Congiegation, that,</HI> if any Per&s;on, tho' a poor Indian &s;hould &s;tep forth and &s;ay, <HI>I love the LORD JESUS CHRIST in Sincerity and Truth,</HI> and &s;hould te&s;tify his Willingne&s;s to walk according to the Go&s;pel, tho' his Defects were great for Ignorance and the Like, He &s;hould be for admitting him to the LORD'S Table.</NOTE>,</HI> may not neverthele&s;s be excluded nor yet di&s;couraged from attending the Communion with us in our Churches.</P>

<P>The Brethren in our Churches may po&s;&s;ibly be wrought upon &s;o far as to <HI>part with this Privilege to unrea&s;onable Claimers</HI> of it: But, be&s;ides the <HI>Di&s;honour</HI> re&s;ulting from &s;uch a tame Re&s;ignation of a valuable Right, <HI>our Brethren ought to con&s;ider the bad Con&s;e|quence,</HI> the va&s;t Mi&s;chief, <HI>of parting with it:</HI> There cannot indeed be a <HI>greater Inlet to Corruption</HI> than this; for <HI>Churches</HI> mu&s;t unavoidably be <HI>corrupted and the Ordinances mi&s;erably defiled</HI> in them, while the unworthy are freely received into them and <HI>the Brethren have not the Power,</HI> as they have the Right, <HI>of refu&s;ing &s;uch Per&s;ons.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Rea&s;on of the Thing</HI> therefore is &s;ufficient for the Ju&s;tification of the&s;e Churches <HI>in the U&s;e of their Li|berty to judge concerning the Qualifications of tho&s;e that offer them&s;elves to their Communion:</HI> But we have <HI>Scrip|tural Authority and Example</HI> be&s;ides, in favour of the <HI>Brethren's Power and Liberty to propound any ju&s;t and rea&s;onable Exceptions</HI> again&s;t &s;uch Per&s;ons as appear di&s;|qualified for Admi&s;&s;ion into their Communion and the Privileges con&s;equent upon &s;uch an Admi&s;&s;ion: For the Apo&s;tle PETER him&s;elf would not admit the Family of CORNELIUS to <HI>Bapti&s;m,</HI> until he had enquired of the Brethren, whether any of them had any Thing to

IX. 26 and 27 Ver&s;es.</P>
<P>And the mo&s;t <HI>primitive Antiquity,</HI> next to the Days of the Apo&s;tles, has taught the&s;e Churches to be <HI>careful about their Admi&s;&s;ions</HI> into Communion: 'Tis true in the extraordinary Conver&s;ions to Chri&s;tianity which were made among the <HI>Jews,</HI> they were all <HI>immediately added to the Church:</HI> And it is not much to be wondred at that they were &s;o, becau&s;e they were <HI>before</HI> acquaint|ed with the Law and the Prophets, and were already <HI>brought into the Covenant</HI> of GOD: But <HI>afterwards</HI> the Churches did not make it their ordinary Practice <HI>im|mediately to admit Per&s;ons into full Communion;</HI> but kept them as <HI>Catechumens,</HI> that &s;o their Knowlege might be encrea&s;ed and the Truth of their Profe&s;&s;ion might be tried, until they were judged <HI>qualified</HI> for joining to the Church and enjoying complete Commu|nion in it.</P>
<P>And this is a Thing that appears, not only from JUSTIN MARTYR, who a&s;&s;erts, that <HI>none were al|low'd to communicate in the Church</HI> in his Time <HI>but &s;uch as were baptized and believed the Doctrines of Chri&s;tianity and lived according to the Laws of JESUS CHRIST;</HI> but it is al&s;o manife&s;t from numberle&s;s ancient Writers, that <HI>the Baptized</HI> were of old <HI>confirmed</HI> before they were admitted into Communion, and that in <HI>&s;ome</HI> of the primitive Churches <HI>none</HI> could be re|ceived into full Communion or be <HI>perfect</HI> among them, until he had given &s;ome Evidence of a Principle of Goodne&s;s within him.</P>
<P>Nor is it a Matter of much Di&s;&s;iculty to prove, that in the <HI>Prinitive Times</HI> none were received to the Pro|fe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity, unle&s;s they had fir&s;t given &s;ome

<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed indeed, that, as it was u&s;ual among the Primitive Chri&s;tians to imitate the Heathens <HI>too far</HI> in &s;everal Re&s;pects referring to their &s;acred Rites, <HI>they</HI> particularly di&s;tributed their Converts into <HI>two Cla&s;&s;es</HI> according to the <HI>Pagan</HI> Style: For, as among the <HI>Pagans</HI> there were <HI>Learners and Illuminated Per&s;ons;</HI> thus we find in the Fathers the&s;e <HI>two</HI> very frequently mentioned: And in them, as the <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> are di&s;tingui&s;hed, &s;o are their <HI>Duties and Privileges:</HI> And it mu&s;t be acknowleged, that the Apo&s;tle PAUL fre|quently <HI>alludes to the&s;e Di&s;tinctions,</HI> and that the ancient Divines afterwards made an ill U&s;e of tho&s;e Allu|&s;ions.</P>
<P>But, altho' the Improvements which were made of &s;uch Di&s;tinctions proved in Proce&s;s of Time not only <HI>&s;uperfluous,</HI> but al&s;o very prejudicial to Chri&s;tianity; neverthele&s;s, that Things may be done <HI>agreable to Rea|&s;on and Prudence,</HI> and that all Things may be perform'd <HI>decently and in Order</HI> according to Apo&s;tolical Directi|on, the Churches &s;hould be careful not at once to admit the <HI>Learners</HI> among the <HI>Illuminated:</HI> For there is <HI>no Divine Warrant nor any Rea&s;on,</HI> why &s;uch as are not ca|pable of <HI>witne&s;&s;ing a good Confe&s;&s;ion</HI> and have not mani|fe&s;ted their <HI>Faith</HI> and the Truth of their Profe&s;&s;ion <HI>by their Works</HI> &s;hould be favour'd with equal Privileges to tho&s;e who are capable of the&s;e Things.</P>

<P>THE Churches of JESUS CHRIST in this Land are of Opinion, that, not only the <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> or Elders or Bi&s;hops of the Churches, but <HI>all the Chri&s;tians</HI> al&s;o which compo&s;e them, <HI>have the Care of their Bre|thren;</HI> and that every Chri&s;tian, by the Authority of JESUS CHRIST, may <HI>confirm and e&s;tabli&s;h his Brethren in Knowlege and Faith, and exhort them to proceed in the Ways of Religion and Goodne&s;s;</HI> and that, if any of his Brethren &s;hould &s;ub&s;ide either into <HI>fatal Doctrinal Errors or irregular Behaviours,</HI> every Chri&s;tian &s;hould u&s;e his Endeavour to <HI>reduce</HI> them from their Errors in Judgment and the Irregularities of their Conduct to the Truth of the Chri&s;tian Doctrine, and a diligent Conformity to the Divine Precepts: This is the Opi|nion of the&s;e Churches; and the Reformation of Chur|ches by this Di&s;cipline, wherein <HI>Love without Di&s;&s;imu|lation</HI> is exerci&s;ed, we judge to be the only Method of recovering Evangelical Love out of its Langui&s;hments and re&s;toring it to its primitive Vigour and Glory.</P>

<P>Wherefore, that &s;o this Di&s;cipline may rightly and properly be admini&s;tred, there is a <HI>twofold Di&s;tinction of Offences</HI> to be ob&s;erved: For, while &s;ome are <HI>&s;ecret and private,</HI> others are <HI>public and open;</HI> and &s;ome are <HI>great,</HI> whereas others are comparatively <HI>&s;mall:</HI> According to which Di&s;tinctions, the Di&s;cipline of CHRIST is to be <HI>privately exerci&s;ed</HI> towards &s;uch who&s;e <HI>Offences are private;</HI> whereas, if the <HI>Offences</HI> of any be <HI>public</HI> and to the Scandal of the Church, they are to be <HI>publickly admoni&s;hed and cen&s;ured.</HI></P>
<P>If the <HI>Offence,</HI> that is committed by a Chri&s;tian Bro|ther, be <HI>private,</HI> provided two or three are ob&s;ervers of it, there &s;hould the be <HI>three Steps</HI> taken by his Chri&s;tian Brethren in dealing with him: <HI>Fir&s;t of all,</HI> one of tho&s;e who has &s;een the Offence of his Brother, &s;hould <HI>pri|vately admoni&s;h and reprove</HI> him for it: And, if the <HI>offending Brother de&s;pi&s;e the Admonition and Reproof</HI> given him; then, in the <HI>next</HI> Place, he, that is ac|quainted with his Brother's Offence and grieved at his &s;lighting his Brotherly Correction, &s;hould <HI>take one or two more of his Brethren</HI> with him, that &s;o <HI>by the Mouth of two or three Witne&s;&s;es</HI> the Regularity of the Procee|dure may be e&s;tabli&s;hed: And, <HI>in fine,</HI> if <HI>the offending Brother &s;hall continue to &s;light the Admonitions</HI> which are
<PB N="97" REF="004275_0114_100547A44E19B9D8">thus duely given him, the <HI>third and la&s;t</HI> Step to be taken is, to <HI>tell the Church</HI> of his Fault and of his Di&s;|regard of the Chri&s;tian Conduct of his Brethren to|wards him.</P>
<P>But, if the Offence be <HI>at fir&s;t public</HI> and manife&s;t unto all, then there is <HI>no need of &s;uch a regular and gradual Proce&s;s;</HI> but <HI>your open and flagitious public Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors</HI> are at once <HI>to be rebuked before all, that others al&s;o may fear,</HI> as in 1 Tim. V. 20. And yet even <HI>this public Di&s;cipline</HI> &s;hould be exerci&s;ed according to the Di&s;tinction of <HI>great Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions</HI> or compara|tively <HI>&s;amll</HI> ones; according to which Di&s;tinction, there &s;hould be either a <HI>public Admonition and Reproof</HI> or <HI>a Deprivation of the Privileges of their Chri&s;tian Brethren</HI> who walk orderly: For <HI>Admonition and Reproof</HI> is a &s;ufficient Correction for <HI>&s;maller</HI> public Offences. But, as for <HI>gro&s;&s;er Sins,</HI> and <HI>Stubbornne&s;s under kind Admo|nitions</HI> even tho' for <HI>&s;maller Faults,</HI> the&s;e de&s;erve to be puni&s;hed with denying the further Enjoyment of Com|munion and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Privileges.</P>
<P>So then the <HI>Duty</HI> of the Brethren is clear, and their <HI>Power</HI> is great and invaluable: It is their <HI>Duty</HI> to ex|po&s;tulate with their Brethren, and as &s;uch to deal with them, <HI>when they are guilty of private Scandals, in a pri|vate Way,</HI> in a friendly and Chri&s;tian Manner: And it is their <HI>Duty, Power and Privilege</HI> al&s;o <HI>to hear and judge concerning their Brethren in public Scandals;</HI> and, as they may <HI>forgive and receive</HI> &s;uch as are truely <HI>peni|tent,</HI> they may al&s;o <HI>reprove, rebuke, exhort and cen&s;ure notoricus Offenders:</HI> For, when our SAVIOUR requi|reth a Chri&s;tian, that, if he cannot &s;ucceed &s;o far as to heal the Offence <HI>in private,</HI> he &s;hould then <HI>tell the Church;</HI> He certainly means <HI>a particular or Congrega|tional Church <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Die Eccle&s;iae</HI>&mdash;Hic Locus proprie &amp; prima<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e de <HI>Eccle&s;iis par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cularibus</HI> intelligendus e&s;t, non de <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">menica five E&s;&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tial<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> five Repre&s;entativa: Nam deferre Offen&s;as ad Eccle&s;iam Oecumeni|cam E&s;&s;entialem impo&s;&s;ibile e&s;t.&mdash;CHRISTUS amandat Fideles ad Conventum ordinarium &amp; Remedium parati&s;&s;imum.

<P>And this Direction of our ble&s;&s;ed SAVIOUR nece&s;|&s;arily implies, that <HI>the Church &s;hould hear the Ca&s;e</HI> brought before them, <HI>make Enquiry into the State</HI> of it, that &s;o they may &s;ee with their own Eyes the Offence which has bin committed, and then <HI>judge concerning the Offence</HI> as they &s;hould find upon Enquiry.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things are &s;o plain and obvious to common Under&s;tandings, that Men could never have perverted the Sen&s;e of our SAVIOUR'S Words, if they were de|&s;irous of attending to them and ob&s;erving them: Nor, if their <HI>Love to Truth</HI> were equal to their Regard to their Intere&s;t, could they &s;o mi&s;under&s;tand our LORD'S Direction as by a pretended Regard to it to deviate from the Simplicity of the Go&s;pel.</P>

<P>To proceed.</P>
<P>That <HI>the Church or Brethren have the Power of Judg|ing,</HI> as has bin &s;aid, may be argued from <HI>&s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages upon &s;acred Record;</HI> from which Pa&s;&s;ages it is abun|dantly evident, that they gave their Determination and Judgment in &s;uch Ca&s;es as properly came before them.</P>
<P>Not to mention, that the <HI>Brethren of the Circumci&s;ion</HI> expo&s;tulated with PETER about his Communion with CORNELIUS and his Family, and that He was &s;o far from <HI>rejecting their Complaint,</HI> as if they had gone be|yond their proper Power and Limits, that He readily undertook and endeavour'd to give them &s;uitable Sati&s;|faction, as has already bin ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>We find, that <HI>the Brethren</HI> of the Church of <HI>Corinth</HI> pa&s;s'd their Cen&s;ure upon the <HI>Ince&s;tuous Corinthian:</HI> And the Apo&s;tle PAUL reproved them all, that they had <HI>no &s;ooner put him away</HI> from among them, as in 1 Cor. V. 2; and, at Ver&s;e 12th, He expre&s;ly a&s;&s;ureth them, that they had <HI>the Power of Judging &s;uch as are within <NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">Huju&s;modi autem Di&s;ciplina pertinere ad Eccle&s;iam &s;atis apparet Ex toto. <HI>Cap.

<P>The &s;ame Apo&s;tle al&s;o towards the Clo&s;e of his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Galatians,</HI> in&s;tructing them in the Di&s;ci|pline
<PB N="100" REF="004275_0117_100547A980279CA0">of the Church, advi&s;es them how to behave with re&s;pect to their <HI>corrupt Teachers:</HI> Laying down the &s;ame Ground and Rea&s;on of proceeding again&s;t them, as again&s;t the <HI>Ince&s;tuous Corinthian,</HI> namely, that <HI>a little Leaven leaveneth the whole Lump,</HI> as in Gal. V. 9; and pre&s;uming that they would be of the &s;ame Mind with him, as in Ver&s;e 10 and 11; he then declares <HI>what Cen&s;ure he wi&s;hed might be pa&s;&s;ed upon</HI> their cor|rupt Teachers, as at Ver&s;e 12, <HI>I would that they were even cut off which trouble you:</HI> Which Pa&s;&s;age all the <HI>Greek</HI> Fathers and &s;ome of the <HI>Latin</HI> oddly interpret, <HI>I wi&s;h they were no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> only</HI> circumci&s;ed, <HI>but even made like the</HI> Prie&s;ts of the Mother of the Gods, who was formerly wor&s;hipped by you of <HI>Galatia <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Usinam non &s;olum circumcidantur, &s;ed etiam ab&s;cindantur.</NOTE>:</HI> But the mo&s;t plain and natural Con&s;truction of it is, <HI>I wi&s;h they were cut off from your Fellow&s;hip and Communion:</HI> And, le&s;t it &s;hould be objected, that the Brethren had not Power to do this, therefore the Apo&s;tle annexes this Rea&s;on, <HI>for, Brethren, ye are called unto Liberty.</HI> And, becau&s;e it might be argued, that <HI>such a Liberty of cut|ting off their Teachers</HI> being allowed would be attended with bad Con&s;equences, therefore the Apo&s;tle advi&s;es, that they do <HI>not u&s;e their Liberty as an Occa&s;ion to the Fle&s;h,</HI> but &s;o as that by Love they might &s;erve one another: Now, if the Brethren have the Power of <HI>cen&s;uring their corrupt Teachers,</HI> as appears from the&s;e Hints, &s;urely they may well have the <HI>Privilege of cen|&s;uring their offending Brethren.</HI></P>
<P>And it was likewi&s;e the Direction of the very &s;ame Apo&s;tle to the whole Church at <HI>The&s;&s;alonica,</HI> to <HI>with|draw them&s;elves from every Brother that walketh di&s;or|derly,</HI> as in 2 The&s;. III. 6: And this Direction of <HI>withdrawing from &s;uch</HI> is much the &s;ame with that wherein he requires them to <HI>warn the unruly,</HI> in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> The&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> V. 14, or admoni&s;h &s;uch: Where the Word which we tran&s;late <HI>unryly</HI> is the very &s;ame as this which
<PB N="101" REF="004275_0118_100547AB019C8960">is tran&s;lated <HI>di&s;orderly:</HI> For this is a Power belonging to all the Members of the Church, as is manife&s;t from the&s;e Directions to them.</P>
<P>And it moreover appears, that <HI>particular Churches have &s;uch a Power;</HI> becau&s;e they are <HI>chargeable with Guilt, if any Offences are committed by their Members and yet remain uncen&s;ured</HI> by them: Thus the Church of <HI>Pergamos</HI> is reproved as guilty of Offence <HI>for &s;uf|fering BALAAM and the</HI> Nicolaitans <HI>among them,</HI> as in Rev. II. 14 and 15; and, at Ver&s;e 20, CHRIST has <HI>a few Things again&s;t</HI> the Church at <HI>Thyatira</HI> for &s;uffering JEZEBEL among them: But, if the&s;e Chur|ches had <HI>not &s;ufficient Power to turn out</HI> the Offenders in them, it would be <HI>hard to blame them for the Tolera|tion</HI> of them in their Communion. And hence we may conclude, that, what our SAVIOUR wrote to any of tho&s;e Churches, <HI>HIS SPIRIT &s;ays to all the Churches:</HI> So that, if we would an&s;wer the Divine Expectations, we &s;hould beware of <HI>Remi&s;&s;ne&s;s in Di&s;cipline and calmly tolerating the like Offences</HI> among our&s;elves; and we &s;hould al&s;o be <HI>careful to admoni&s;h other Churches about</HI> us <HI>with Love and Faithfulne&s;s for the Offences ob&s;ervable in</HI> them.</P>
<P>But, be&s;ides the <HI>Scriptural Directions and Patterns</HI> in Favour of &s;uch a Di&s;cipline, <HI>the Rea&s;on of the Thing</HI> plainly &s;peaks for &s;uch a Power in particular Churches: For, as that animal <HI>Body</HI> is defective, weak and un|&s;ound in its Nature and Con&s;titution, which has not Strength <HI>equal to the Expul&s;ion of the malignant Hu|mours</HI> which are brought into it; even &s;o tho&s;e <HI>Bodies,</HI> particular Churches, would be but <HI>in a feeble State,</HI> which have not <HI>Power to get rid of their vicious, corrupt and offen&s;ive People:</HI> Nor can we think it for the Honour of our ble&s;&s;ed SAVIOUR to leave His Churches in &s;uch a feeble State:&mdash; But we have Rea&s;on to be thank|ful, that the great Head of the Church has given His Churches &s;uch <HI>an athletic Con&s;titution</HI> that they have Power equal to the Purging them&s;elves of their &s;uper|fluous
<PB N="102" REF="004275_0119_100547AD5CC109C8">and vicious Homours: And ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, while &s;ome other Churches are complaining for the Want of a <HI>godly Di&s;cipline,</HI> the&s;e Churches enjoy it and will not &s;uffer &s;uch as are known to be prophane and vile Per&s;ons to e&s;cape it.</P>
<P>Perhaps it will be demanded here, <HI>whether the Chur|ches</HI> in the Ages immediately &s;ucceeding the Apo&s;tles Days <HI>were in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch Power and exerted it upon proper Occa&s;ions?</HI> Now, in An&s;wer to this Enquiry, I would &s;ay, that, &s;uppo&s;ing they <HI>had not nor did exerci&s;e &s;uch a Power,</HI> this does not hinder but that <HI>it properly belonged unto</HI> them, as it appears that it did from the <HI>Injunctions and Examples upon &s;acred Record:</HI> So that they might lawfully and hone&s;tly <HI>take and exer|ci&s;e this Power.</HI></P>
<P>But the Truth is, we find, that <HI>the Churches in the Ages after the Apo&s;tles</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this Power, and on &s;uitable Occa&s;ions u&s;ed the &s;ame.

<P>But &s;ome will be ready to &s;ay, <HI>If the Power of Di&s;|cipline be in the Churches, how came they to be deprived of it?</HI> And the An&s;wer is, that &s;ome vile Per&s;ons, under the &s;pecious Pretence of <HI>rai&s;ing the Church and promot|ing its Power,</HI> called <HI>the Clergy only the Church</HI> fir&s;t of

<P>I would not be under&s;tood, notwith&s;tanding all that has bin &s;aid, <HI>entirely to exclude the Elders from the Ma|nagement of the Di&s;cipline of the Church:</HI> For the <HI>Duty of admoni&s;hing Offenders privately and per&s;onally</HI> belongs to them <HI>in common with the re&s;t of the Church;</HI> tho' it does not properly belong to the <HI>Elders as &s;uch,</HI> but only <HI>as Brethren of the &s;ame Society:</HI> And yet it mu&s;t be allowed, that <HI>Elders</HI> by Virtue of their Office are <HI>enabled to do it with more Authority in a moral Sen&s;e,</HI> tho' they do not &s;trictly and properly <HI>exerci&s;e the Power of their Office.</HI> And it mu&s;t be acknowleged, that in the Di&s;charge of their Office they may be capacitated to &s;ee and know the Faults of the Brethren &s;ooner than others; but yet, in the Exerci&s;e of this Di&s;cipline every Member is <HI>equally concerned with the Elders,</HI> as appears from the Obligations which lie upon them to watch over and exerci&s;e &s;pecial Love towards one another; for their Obligations to this are equal: And indeed this Duty is &s;o incumbent on <HI>every Member</HI> of the Church, that, if any neglect it, he <HI>&s;ins again&s;t the In&s;titution of CHRIST</HI> and becomes <HI>a Partaker in the Sin</HI> of the offending Party, and is <HI>guilty of his Danger and Ruin,</HI> as well as <HI>chargeable with all the Inconveniencies and I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">uries accruing to the Church</HI> by the Continuance of its Members in Sin and Wickedne&s;s: So that, upon the&s;e Con&s;iderations, all the Brethren not only have the

<P>But, altho' this Duty be per&s;onally incumbent on every <HI>particular Member of the Church,</HI> this however hinders not but that, if <HI>&s;everal</HI> at the &s;ame Time <HI>know the Sin</HI> of an Offender and jointly are offended at it, they may <HI>together,</HI> if they think it prudent, <HI>in the fir&s;t In&s;tance admoni&s;h</HI> him: And, if they do &s;o, this is to be con&s;idered as <HI>the fir&s;t and private Admonition.</HI></P>
<P>As to the <HI>Way and Manner</HI> wherein this Duty is to be di&s;charged, I would only ob&s;erve, that it &s;hould be done <HI>with Prudence, Tenderne&s;s and a due Regard to all Circum&s;tances, from Love to the Per&s;on offending, out of Obedience to JESUS CHRIST, agreably to the Rule</HI> which is given for our Direction in it and <HI>with a Rea|dine&s;s to receive Satisfaction.</HI></P>
<P>And now the great and good <HI>Ends</HI> to be propo&s;ed in &s;uch a Di&s;cipline are, that <HI>undi&s;&s;embled Love may be maintained,</HI> that the <HI>offending Brother may be gained,</HI> that he may be <HI>pre&s;erved from Di&s;honour</HI> by the unne|ce&s;&s;ary Divulging of his Failings and Errors, that the <HI>Churches may not be &s;candalized</HI> by the ha&s;ty expo&s;ing of the Failings of their Members whether they be real or imaginary, and that <HI>the Trouble of a public Hearing may be prevented:</HI> And, if the&s;e <HI>Ends</HI> be obtained, by the <HI>accu&s;ed Per&s;on's manife&s;ting his Innocence</HI> as to the Facts alleg'd again&s;t him or by his <HI>Acknowlegement, Repentance and Promi&s;es of Reformation,</HI> then this Part of the Di&s;cipline of CHRIST'S Church has obtained the de&s;ired Effect.</P>
<P>But, if the&s;e good <HI>Ends</HI> be not an&s;wered, then <HI>the Per&s;ons,</HI> who have endeavoured to reclaim their offend|ing Brother by <HI>private Methods,</HI> are to <HI>inform the Elders of the Church</HI> concerning their Proceedure; and <HI>by them the Report &s;hould be made</HI> to the Church, as of the <HI>Crime committed,</HI> &s;o of the <HI>Te&s;timonies given</HI> to prove the Truth

<P>And, when Things are thus propo&s;ed to the Church and the Offender heard, <HI>the whole Church,</HI> Elders and Brethren, are to con&s;ider the <HI>Nature of the Offence and to judge concerning the Offence,</HI> as well as <HI>the Demeanour of the Offender:</HI> And, if <HI>the Offence be evident and glaring,</HI> the Offender is to be <HI>admoni&s;hed with the Con&s;ent and Concurrence of the Church</HI> by the Elders: But, if the Offender <HI>de&s;pi&s;e the Admonition</HI> of the Church and <HI>continues ob&s;tinate and impenitent,</HI> then it is the Mind and Will of our ble&s;&s;ed SAVIOUR, that he &s;hould be <HI>cut off from the Privileges of the Church and ca&s;t out of the Society:</HI> And this is the <HI>la&s;t Act of the Di&s;cipline of the Church</HI> for the Correction of Offenders: So that, by the Con&s;titution of JESUS CHRIST, <HI>the Body of the Church or the Multitude of the Brethren are intere&s;ted in the Admini&s;tration of the Di&s;ciplinary Power in the Church.</HI></P>
<P>This is the Di&s;cipline of the&s;e <HI>Congregational Chur|ches,</HI> which we apprehend to be <HI>mo&s;t conformable to Rea&s;on and the Holy Scriptures, to the Practice of the Apo&s;tles and the Primitive Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>
<P>As to a <HI>Power fa&s;tned to the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven,</HI> a Power of Binding and Loo&s;ing, by which Men can <HI>excommunicate and deliver up a Per&s;on to the Devil</HI> in the Name and by the Authority of JESUS CHRIST, <HI>we pretend to no &s;uch Power:</HI> Nor do we approve of any &s;uch Power, to which &s;ome make their Pretences, by which <HI>Pa&s;tors or Synods,</HI> in Conjunction and Confederacy with the <HI>Civil Magi&s;trate,</HI> or by <HI>an Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Power</HI> di&s;tinct from the Magi&s;trate's, but equal to it, <HI>are capable of binding and lo&s;ing,</HI> as has bin &s;aid: <HI>Nay we dete&s;t it.</HI></P>

<P>That this was an <HI>Act of miraculous Power</HI> vi&s;ibly lodged with the Apo&s;tles is plain to us; becau&s;e, as they could <HI>&s;trike Men blind and dead,</HI> they <HI>had the Power</HI> al&s;o <HI>of letting evil Spirits loo&s;e</HI> to terrify, plague and puni&s;h &s;uch Per&s;ons as were Enemies of Truth and Righteou&s;ne&s;s, that &s;o a <HI>terrible Remedy</HI> might be in|flicted for a <HI>dreadful Evil:</HI> We do not therefore won|der, that the Apo&s;tles never mention <HI>this</HI> among the <HI>&s;tanding Appointments for the Church</HI> to ob&s;erve nor give any Charge or Directions about it: And it appears very &s;trange unto us, that this <HI>Method of denouncing Anathemas has obtained &s;o much in Churches,</HI> and even among &s;uch Churches as pretend to elevated Degrees of Reformation; believing, that the ab&s;urd Notion of the <HI>Infallibility of the Church</HI> has bin carried on by it, and that <HI>it has laid the Foundation for endle&s;s Animo&s;ities and the greate&s;t Uncharitablene&s;s.</HI></P>

<P>As for <HI>particular Churches,</HI> we readily concede, that they, as of equal Power, may in &s;ome Ca&s;es appointed by JESUS CHRIST <HI>meet together by them&s;elves or by their Delegates in a Council or Synod</HI> and may perform &s;undry Acts of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Power; but yet it is our avowed Principle, that the <HI>Members of Councils and Synods,</HI> with <HI>all the Power</HI> which they exerci&s;e and put forth, <HI>are all of them primarily given to the &s;everal par|titular Churches,</HI> on who&s;e Account they are gathered and employed, either as the <HI>fir&s;t Subject</HI> in whom they re&s;ide or the <HI>fir&s;t Object</HI> about whom they are conver|&s;ant: So that, altho' we differ from &s;ome of our Neigh|bours about <HI>the Power of Councils and Synods,</HI> we have no Difference at all with them about their <HI>Being;</HI> for we freely acknowlege, that they <HI>ought to be, when pro|per Occa&s;ions</HI> require.</P>
<P>Dr. HUMPHREY HODY has publi&s;hed an <HI>Hi&s;tory of Engli&s;h Councils and Convocations, and of the Clergy's &s;itting in Parliament,</HI> in 1701, in which he has taken a great deal of Pains and Care in turning over ancient Hecords and collecting Pa&s;&s;ages out of them; but by them <HI>it does not appear, where the Original Right of convening Councils and Synods was lodged:</HI> He &s;hews indeed, that <HI>Synods were &s;ometimes called by the Autho|rity of the Clergy, and at other Times convened by the
<PB N="112" REF="004275_0129_100547C015E5F118">Prince:</HI> But this does not determine, where <HI>the Right of Convening</HI> them is placed.</P>
<P><HI>Councils and Synods</HI> &s;hould be compo&s;ed of &s;uch Per|&s;ons as are fit and proper, both of the <HI>Elder&s;hip and the Laity;</HI> and both have <HI>equal Right to &s;peak their Senti|ments</HI> in them: 'Tis true <HI>a particular Regard</HI> may &s;ometimes be had to <HI>Pa&s;tors and Bi&s;hops</HI> in &s;ending De|legates to Synods: But, if the Churches &s;hould only have &s;uch <HI>Bi&s;hops or Pa&s;tors</HI> as are either <HI>not &s;o well ac|quainted</HI> with their Con&s;titution or are <HI>Enemies unto</HI> it, it is their <HI>Duty to keep them at Home</HI> at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>And, when a Number of pious, &s;kilful and prudent Per&s;ons, both <HI>Mini&s;ters and Brethren,</HI> are &s;ent and con|vened in Council or Synod, they ought to have <HI>equal Power and Authority</HI> in acting and voting: This is the <HI>Right of the Fraternity;</HI> and, in order to &s;upport and e&s;tabli&s;h this <HI>Right of the Fraternity</HI> in Councils and Synods, there are a few brief Remarks to be offered, which have con&s;iderable Weight and Significance in them.</P>
<P>It is certain, that we have the <HI>Authority of the Scrip|tures and the Practice of the Church</HI> in the Apo&s;tle's Days for this Power of the Brethren: For we read, that the <HI>Apo&s;tles and Elders came together to con&s;ider of the Matter</HI> that was to be laid before them, in Act. XV. 6: And it follows, at Ver&s;e 22, <HI>then plea&s;ed it the Apo&s;tles and Elders,</HI> with the whole Church, <HI>to &s;end ebo&s;en Men,</HI> &amp;c: From which Pa&s;&s;ages it plainly ap|pears, that, not only the <HI>Apo&s;tles and Elders,</HI> but <HI>the whole Church</HI> al&s;o, and &s;o the <HI>People,</HI> were pre&s;ent in this Council and were concerned in the definitive Sen|tence of it: But now <HI>this Council</HI> ought to be <HI>the Rule and Pattern for all other Councils</HI> whether greater or &s;maller: Since therefore in this Council, not only the <HI>Apo&s;tles and Elders,</HI> but <HI>all the People</HI> are &s;aid to give their Opinion and unite in the definitive Decree; &s;urely <HI>the &s;ame Rule ought to be ob&s;erved in all other Councils or Synods:</HI> For, as all other Synods are va&s;tly-inferiour to
<PB N="113" REF="004275_0130_1005474609E88B78">this Apo&s;tolical one, it may well be expected that they &s;hould be <HI>conformable to the &s;ame.</HI></P>
<P>And, be&s;ides this <HI>Example</HI> upon &s;acred Record to ju&s;tify <HI>the Right of the Brethren to &s;it and act in Council,</HI> there are &s;everal Places of Scripture, which <HI>allow all the Faithful</HI> in Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Conventions to judge in re|ligious Matters: Not to in&s;i&s;t upon that Pa&s;&s;age, in 1 Cor. XIV. 24, where it is &s;aid, <HI>If all prophe&s;y, and there come that believeth not or one unlearned,</HI> he is con|vinced of all, he is judged of all: It is plain both from the <HI>old any new Te&s;tament,</HI> that <HI>Divine Matters &s;hould be publickly con&s;idered</HI> by the People and the <HI>final Judg|ment</HI> referring to them &s;hould be left with the People. So we read, in 1 King. XVIII. 21 and 39 Ver&s;es, that ELIJAH <HI>came to all the People and &s;aid, how long balt ye between two Opinions? If the LORD be GOD, follow HIM; but if</HI> Baal, <HI>follow him: And the People an&s;wered Him not a Word.&mdash;And when all the People &s;aw</HI> [how the Sacrifice was con&s;umed from above] <HI>they fell on their Faces and &s;aid, The LORD HE is GOD, the LORD HE is the GOD.</HI> And it is written, that, when <HI>PHILIP preached to the City of</HI> Samaria, <HI>the People with one Accord gave Heed to the Things which He &s;pake, and there was great Joy in the City,</HI> as in Act. VIII. 6 and 8 Ver&s;es. So that it &s;hould &s;eem, as if the People, upon hearing and maturely weighing the Di&s;cour&s;es of PHILIP, publickly te&s;tified their Appro|bation of what He taught them.</P>
<P>And it is worthy to be ob&s;erved, that <HI>this Right of the Laity</HI> has bin a&s;&s;erted and exerci&s;ed in later Times: For, not to mention it, that the <HI>Temporal Lords and Commons,</HI> in the two Reigns that brought on the Refor|mation, were much better Judges of Religion, than the Bi&s;hops and the Convocation; and, if they had not pro|moted the Reformation, tho' <HI>poor Laicks,</HI> the Engli&s;h Nation to this Day had lain buried in the <HI>Aegyptian,</HI> and wor&s;e than Aegyptian, <HI>Darkne&s;s of Popery.</HI>&mdash;It is well known, that, when the Calling of that infamous
<PB N="114" REF="004275_0131_100547C2903BDE58">A&s;&s;embly the Council of <HI>Trent</HI> was propo&s;ed at <HI>Norim|berg,</HI> in the Year 1522, all the E&s;tates of <HI>Germany</HI> de&s;ired and in&s;i&s;ted, that <HI>Admittance might be granted unto Laymen</HI> as well as Clergymen, to be, not only <HI>Spectators and Witne&s;&s;es,</HI> but al&s;o <HI>Judges</HI> in the Council: Which being refu&s;ed, they would not come unto it, but publi&s;hed the Rea&s;ons of their withdraw; one of which was, <HI>becau&s;e Laymen were not allowed to vote among them.</HI> And what learned Engli&s;hman is there that can be ignorant, how our learned WHITAKER, our excellent JUEL, our &s;kilful and indu&s;trious WIL|LET and other Writers of our Nation, in writing again&s;t the <HI>Romani&s;ts, maintain the Right of Laicks to &s;it and judge in Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Councils?</HI> And, as the mo&s;t famous Councils and Synods in the Churches of the Reforma|tion have admitted &s;uch Members in them; &s;o, in the primitive Times and the Ages next unto the Apo&s;tles, it is unque&s;tionable that &s;uch had not only <HI>Seats,</HI> but <HI>Votes</HI> in Councils allowed them: And, even in as late a Council as that of <HI>Calcedon,</HI> we find <HI>&s;even Earls, ten Senators and others,</HI> be&s;ides Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks.</P>
<P>But, in Truth if there were <HI>no In&s;tances or Examples</HI> of this, this is very plain and evident, that <HI>the Divine Spirit &s;ometimes and very frequently be&s;tows &s;uch Gifts on the Brotherhood</HI> as render them worthy to be heard and make it fit that they &s;hould declare their Judgment: So that <HI>the Rea&s;on of the Thing</HI> requires, that <HI>their Gifts &s;hould not be de&s;pi&s;ed,</HI> but that they &s;hould <HI>have the Liberty of exerci&s;ing them freely upon requi&s;ite Occa&s;ions.</HI></P>
<P>And <HI>Natural Ju&s;tice,</HI> be&s;ides, &s;upplies us with an Argument in Defence of the <HI>Brethren's Right to &s;it and act in Councils:</HI> For nothing can be more fit and ju&s;t and equal, than that <HI>the common Cau&s;e of all the Chur|ches &s;hould be determined by the Votes and Suffrages of the Churches:</HI> And, ina&s;much as the HOLY SPIRIT with His influences is not confined to <HI>any particular &s;ort of Men</HI> in the Churches, it is fit that <HI>every Brother &s;hould exerci&s;e freely the Gifts which he has freely received:</HI> For

<P>Furthermore; As the <HI>Scripture</HI> is the <HI>Supreme Judge of all Controver&s;ies</HI> in Religion and <HI>the infallible Rule of all Judgment;</HI> and as they who &s;it and act in Coun|cils and Synods are only to be <HI>Interpreters and Ex|plainers</HI> of what is contained in the Word of GOD, therefore <HI>the Brethren,</HI> as well and as much as their Officers, <HI>may give their Judgment in Councils and Sy|nods.</HI> And indeed the Opinion of <HI>one Layman,</HI> which is agreable to the Scriptures, is to be preferred before the &s;olemn Judgment of an whole Council of Clergy|men which is contradictory to them.

<P>Upon &s;uch <HI>Grounds and Rea&s;ons</HI> as the&s;e, the Chur|ches in <HI>New-England</HI> have a&s;&s;erted the <HI>Right of the Peo|ple to &s;it and act in Synods</HI> in their <HI>Platform of Church-Di&s;cipline:</HI> And agreable to the&s;e Principles, as well as the concurring Practice of the Primitive Churches, the&s;e Churches have always allow'd the <HI>Brethren</HI> their full Liberty in Councils. And it is worthy to be re|marked, that in the Synod of the&s;e Churches, convened in the Year 1679, &s;ome <HI>Elders</HI> came from &s;ome parti|cular Churches to repre&s;ent them <HI>without any Brethren:</HI> at which the Synod was &s;o far di&s;&s;atisfied, that they <HI>would not &s;uffer tho&s;e Pa&s;tors to &s;it with</HI> them, until they had prevailed with their Churches to &s;end &s;ome <HI>Brethren</HI> along with them: For they were very jealous of allow|ing any Thing, that might <HI>look like an Infringement</HI> of that Liberty which by Divine In&s;titution belongs to particular Churches.</P>
<P>But, if any &s;hall remain di&s;&s;atisfied upon this Head, after all that has bin offered; I mu&s;t beg leave to refer them for the more full Di&s;play and Confirmation of it to a learned <HI>Di&s;qui&s;ition concerning Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Councils,</HI> which was publi&s;h'd by my Grandfather Dr. INCREASE MATHER;wherein there is enow &s;aid to &s;atisfy any rea&s;onable Man concerning <HI>this Right of the Brethren</HI> for which I have bin pleading.</P>
<P>The&s;e Churches in <HI>New-England</HI> have never con|vened in a General Synod but upon the Motion of the <HI>Civil Magi&s;trate</HI> to con&s;ider of Affairs wherein all the Churches were concerned: But they &s;uppo&s;e, notwith|&s;tanding this, that they have a full Liberty to meet in <HI>Synods,</HI> without the Direction of the <HI>Civil Magi&s;trate:</HI> For <HI>&s;uch a Liberty</HI> the primitive Churches had before
<PB N="118" REF="004275_0135_100547CB48BB4A60">CONSTANTINE a&s;cended the Imperial Throne: And &s;urely <HI>no Chri&s;tian Prince has any Right to hinder the&s;e Churches</HI> in the Exerci&s;e of this Liberty, when they judge it requi&s;ite for the pre&s;erving of their Peace and good Order.</P>
<P>And this will more e&s;pecially appear, if it be con|&s;idered, that the <HI>Synods of the&s;e Churches are not like tho&s;e of other Churches:</HI> For they have <HI>no Weapons but what are &s;piritual:</HI> They neither pretend to nor de&s;ire any Power that is <HI>juridical:</HI> If they can but <HI>in&s;truct and per&s;uade,</HI> they gain their End: But, when they have done all, <HI>the Churches are</HI> &s;till <HI>free to accept or refu&s;e their Advice:</HI> As they have no <HI>&s;ecular Power</HI> to enforce their Canons, they neither a&s;k nor de&s;ire its Aid. And, &s;ince the&s;e Synods are &s;uch <HI>innocent and inoffen&s;ive Things,</HI> none, that have any due Information concerning them, can rea&s;onably object again&s;t their Meeting to|gether or forbid them, <HI>without a manife&s;t Inva&s;ion of the common Liberties of Mankind.</HI></P>

Pote&s;tat.</HI> p. 168.] he has fully proved that <HI>there was never a truely General Council called,</HI> excepting that at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> that <HI>Councils have no governing or legi&s;lative Power by Divine Right,</HI> and that <HI>what was written in Synods</HI> for the &s;ake of Order <HI>are not called Laws,</HI> but Canons, <HI>and have the Force of</HI> Advice only, or <HI>oblige by Way of Con&s;ent and Agreement.</HI> But to return, I would cite a Pa&s;&s;age from the learned Mr. RICHARD HOOKER, wherein he delivers, not only his own par|ticular Judgment, but, as he apprehended, the Judg|ment of the Church of <HI>England:</HI> The Pa&s;&s;age of this zealous A&s;&s;ertor of the Church's Authority to which I refer, is to be &s;een in his celebrated Book of <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal Polity,</HI> and is as follows; <HI>I grant,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>that Proof derived from the Authority of Man's Judgment is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t able to work that A&s;&s;urance, which doth grow by a &s;tronger Proof; and therefore, altho' ten thou&s;and</HI> General Councils <HI>&s;hould &s;et down one and the &s;ame definitive Sen|tence concerning any Point of Religion what&s;oever; yet one demon&s;trative</HI> Rea&s;on <HI>alledged or one</HI> Te&s;timony cited

<P>And yet, after all, it is of very little Con&s;equence unto us, <HI>who are for or again&s;t a Juridical Power</HI> in Synods or Councils: It is enow for us, that <HI>we have weigh|ty</HI> and unto us <HI>&s;ufficient and &s;atisfactory Rea&s;ons again&s;t allowing &s;uch a Power</HI> unto them. And <HI>the Rea&s;ons,</HI> which have moved the&s;e Churches to give into the&s;e Sentiments, are &s;uch as the&s;e: We know, that our Lord JESUS CHRIST is <HI>the &s;upreme Teacher &s;ent from GOD,</HI> and that <HI>His Word is the &s;upreme Law of Chri&s;tians,</HI> altogether infallible, and that therefore <HI>our la&s;t Appeal ought to be to that:</HI> We think, that <HI>all the Power,</HI> which any Servants of CHRIST ought to have in the Churches, <HI>is mini&s;terial only,</HI> and not <HI>Proetorian:</HI> Our Opinion is, that, if the <HI>Emba&s;&s;adors of earthly Princes</HI> may not exceed the In&s;tructions of their Ma&s;|ters, <HI>much le&s;s</HI> may any Mini&s;ters, or Emba&s;&s;adors of the Prince of Peace go beyond the Directions of their great LORD and Ma&s;ter: It is our Judgment, that, if <HI>the Determinations of Councils</HI> be founded upon the Opi|nions of Men, weak and fallible Men, and not upon the Truth of GOD'S Word, the ble&s;&s;ed GOD would be contrary to HIMSELF: For how can it be con|&s;i&s;tent for Him, to <HI>define and appoint one Thing in the Scripture, and to determine otherwi&s;e in a Council?</HI> And, in fine, We are confirmed in the&s;e our Sentiments from the <HI>Practice of all lawful Councils:</HI> For we find in the Apo&s;tolical Council, JAMES an&s;wered, &s;aying, <HI>Men and Brethren, hearken to me: SIMEON hath de|clared, how GOD at fir&s;t did vi&s;it the</HI> Gentiles <HI>to take out of them a People for his Name: And to this agree the Words of the Prophets,</HI> as in Act.

<P>Some of our Brethren, we are fully &s;en&s;ible, think it not enow for Councils to per&s;uade and give Advice, but <HI>want &s;omething more</HI> for them; nor can they be plea&s;ed, unle&s;s they have them <HI>clothed with a binding juridical Power:</HI> But to the&s;e our Brethren it is &s;uffici|ent to &s;ay, that, if they would have <HI>this Power of bind|ing and giving Law in indifferent Things,</HI> they are for <HI>exceeding the Bounds of the Commi&s;&s;ion which was given to the Apo&s;tles</HI> them&s;elves: And a larger Commi&s;&s;ion than theirs cannot with any Mode&s;ty be challenged by Elders, Synods or Churches. But, if this <HI>binding Power</HI> be de&s;ired and pleaded for only <HI>in E&s;&s;ential Matters,</HI> then we may proceed and argue thus, that, as <HI>Synods</HI> may meet to communicate Light and Peace to &s;uch Per&s;ons or Churches as are erronious or contentious, they may al&s;o at the &s;ame Time <HI>have Power not only to give Light and Coun&s;el, but likewi&s;e to require them in the Name of JESUS CHRIST to attend and conform to the &s;ame:</HI> But, after all, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>the

<P>Many, we are aware, are forward to contend, that <HI>Councils and Synods are not &s;o liable to err as particular Churches, and that</HI> therefore <HI>Appeals &s;hould in all Ca&s;es be preferred unto them:</HI> This is the Rea&s;on, which the celebrated RUTHERFURD gives for &s;uch Appeals. And, if this be <HI>the Rea&s;on of &s;uch Appeals,</HI> it will then follow, that <HI>the greate&s;t A&s;&s;emblies &s;hould err the &s;eldome&s;t,</HI> ina&s;much as they have <HI>mo&s;t Eyes,</HI> and &s;o <HI>Appeals &s;hould be frequently made in difficult Ca&s;es unto them:</HI> So that, by this Rule, all Matters of Importance will be brought before <HI>General and Oecumenical Councils:</HI> And what &s;hall we &s;ay to the&s;e plau&s;ible Arguings?</P>
<P>In An&s;wer to them, I could argue and urge it, that, according to this Method and Rule of Proceeding, <HI>Cau&s;es would be too long depending, and probably would never come to an I&s;&s;ue:</HI> Whereas we think, that out ble&s;&s;ed SAVIOUR has made a better Provi&s;ion for His Churches than this: But, in&s;tead of pre&s;&s;ing this Argu|ment, I would ob&s;erve, that <HI>whole Synods and General Councils are as liable to deceive and be deceived</HI> and im|po&s;ed on as particular Churches.</P>

<P>The Church of <HI>England</HI> has well determined in its <HI>nineteenth</HI> Article, that <HI>the Churches of</HI> Jeru&s;alem, Alexandria, Antioch <HI>and</HI> Rome <HI>have erred in Points of the greate&s;t Con&s;equence:</HI> And, in the <HI>twenty fir&s;t</HI> Arti|cle, that <HI>General Councils may err.</HI></P>

<P>Upon the whole then; Since even <HI>General Councils</HI> may trick and be trick'd, and are as liable to err as a Synod or even a particular Church; Mankind mu&s;t be very &s;tupid indeed to think, that <HI>they &s;hould have a binding Power and may force their Decrees upon any Society or Per&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>But yet, if after all it &s;hould be allowed for Argu|ment's &s;ake, that <HI>&s;uch Councils were infallible and all their Decrees were entirely agreable to the Mind of GOD;</HI> ir will not neverthele&s;s appear, that they have <HI>any juri|dical Power</HI> at all: For, if we grant them a <HI>Doctrinal Power,</HI> by which they could unerringly clear up the Mind of GOD our SAVIOUR, &s;till <HI>the Power of Juri&s;|diction,</HI> as has bin already explained, <HI>would remain in

<P>In fine; <HI>The Way of the&s;e Churches</HI> has bin, and it is the <HI>be&s;t Way</HI> that can be ob&s;erved, to enquire <HI>where our ble&s;&s;ed SAVIOUR has placed the la&s;t Cen&s;uring and final Determination of Cau&s;es:</HI> And, having found this, they <HI>ought to re&s;t contented: Councils and Synods,</HI> when Ad|vice and A&s;&s;i&s;tance is needed, <HI>may be u&s;ed by them;</HI> but it is not either their <HI>not Erring at all</HI> or their <HI>Erring more rarely,</HI> that is a &s;ufficient Rea&s;on for placing any Power of Juri&s;diction in them, unle&s;s our great LORD and Ma&s;ter has ordered that they &s;hall have &s;uch a Power: But, as yet, <HI>this does not appear.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore it is to be hoped, that <HI>the Brethren</HI> in the&s;e Churches <HI>will always maintain their Right to &s;it and act in Councils and Synods;</HI> but yet that they will <HI>never think of placing any juridical Power</HI> in them, but will <HI>always continue to a&s;&s;ert the Powers and Privileges of particular Churches, which are &s;acred Things, by no means to be &s;lighted and undervalued, nor to be left at the Mercy of any Cla&s;&s;es or Councils, Synods or General Meetings.</HI></P>

<P>THrough the Favour of our ble&s;&s;ed SAVIOUR, <HI>His Churches may hold Communion with one ano|ther:</HI> For, altho' <HI>no particular Church is &s;ubject to another</HI> particular Church of however large an Extent, as the Churches in the <HI>united Provinces</HI> have bin &s;o free as to declare with us in <HI>the fir&s;t Article of their Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Con&s;titution;</HI> yet <HI>all the Churches may enjoy mutual and reciprocal Communion among</HI> them&s;elves: And there are <HI>&s;everal Ways, wherein this Communion may be</HI> regularly and laudably <HI>exerci&s;ed;</HI> &s;ome of which have in &s;ome Mea&s;ure bin con&s;idered or hinted at be|fore; but yet there will be no great Hurt in making a <HI>particular Mention</HI> of them here and giving a fair De&s;cription and Recommendation of them.</P>

<HI>Nextly;</HI> Encouraged by the Example of the Apo&s;tle PAUL, who recommended PHEBE a Member of the Church at <HI>Cenchrea</HI> to the Church at <HI>Rome;</HI> the&s;e Churches may <HI>recommend their Brethren</HI> to Neighbour Churches, giving a good Te&s;timony concerning them and entreating the Neighbour Churches to receive them to their &s;acred Fellow&s;hip and to watch over them in Brotherly Love: And, if any Brother have real Occa|&s;ion, either on the Account of his Bu&s;ine&s;s or for any other ju&s;t End and Motive, to <HI>remove with his Family</HI> and take up his Abode in &s;ome other Place, and here|upon acquaints the Church to which he belongs of his Purpo&s;e and the Grounds of his Removal; the Church may then <HI>write more full Letters of Recommendation</HI> to the Church to which he removes, re&s;igning <HI>him</HI> to their Charge and entreating <HI>them</HI> to <HI>receive him as a Brother</HI> and allow him all the Privileges of the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical State among them: And, when, according to the Tenour of &s;uch <HI>Letters recommendatory,</HI> the recom|mended Brother is <HI>accepted into the Fellow&s;hip of the Church,</HI> he is to all Intents and Purpo&s;es a Member of that Church; &s;o that he may perform the Duties and enjoy the Privileges of a Member in that Society.&mdash; Such <HI>Letters of Recommendation</HI> the Apo&s;tle PAUL &s;peaks of in his <HI>Second</HI> Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> Chap. III. Ver&s;e 1, as <HI>needful for others,</HI> tho' not for him|&s;elf.&mdash; And be&s;ides it is <HI>rea&s;onable in it&s;elf,</HI> that none, <HI>without any Recommendations from the Churches</HI> to which they belong, &s;hould claim or be allowed the Privileges of Societies to which they have no Relation or do not properly appertain.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly;</HI> If any particular Church, that for a con|&s;iderable Time has <HI>walked in the Fear of GOD and the Comforts of the HOLY SPIRIT,</HI> has bin <HI>edified and multiplied</HI> to &s;uch a Degree as to be overcharged with Members; they may <HI>&s;end forth their Members</HI> that are qualified for it <HI>to enter into an Eccle&s;ia&s;tical State</HI> among them&s;elves: And by the &s;ame Rea&s;on, if a Number of
<PB N="132" REF="004275_0149_1004335F26AA8770">Chri&s;tians &s;hould come from foreign Parts to a Place where the Church may be &s;o full that they cannot con|veniently join with it, <HI>that Church</HI> may warrantably <HI>encourage them to enter into an holy Combination</HI> among them&s;elves: For &s;uch a <HI>Propagation of Churches</HI> is agreable to Nature and Rea&s;on, con&s;onant with the Practice of the Apo&s;tles and indeed nece&s;&s;ary for the Enlargement of our SAVIOUR'S Kingdom in all Na|tions and Generations to the End of the World.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly;</HI> When <HI>particular Churches have Occa&s;ion of &s;piritual Refre&s;hment or temporal Succour, Neighbour Churches may afford it:</HI> They may furni&s;h them with <HI>able Members</HI> or <HI>&s;pare &s;uitable Officers</HI> to them; and, if they can <HI>conveniently</HI> &s;end &s;uch to their indigent Neigh|bours, they ought with Readine&s;s to impart them: For &s;o, when <HI>Tidings came to the Ears of the Church at</HI> Jeru|&s;alem, [concerning the Succe&s;s of the Go&s;pel] <HI>they &s;ent forth BARNABAS that he &s;hould go as far as Antioch,</HI> as in Act. XI. 22: And it is entirely fit, that &s;uch Churches as are <HI>full of u&s;eful Members and Officers</HI> &s;hould be ready <HI>from their Fulne&s;s to &s;upply the Nece&s;&s;ities</HI> of their Brethren in other Churches. &mdash; And, if any of our Brethren &s;hould fall into <HI>&s;uch poor external Circum&s;tances that they cannot &s;upport them&s;elves and the Go&s;pel,</HI> it is then <HI>our Duty to mini&s;ter to their Nece&s;&s;ities</HI> as GOD &s;hall enable us: For &s;o <HI>the Churches of the Gentiles</HI> made their <HI>liberal Contributions for the poor Saints at</HI> Jeru|&s;alem, as in Rom.

<P><HI>Fifthly: The&s;e Churches may lawfully con&s;ult with one another</HI> and ought to do &s;o as Occa&s;ion requires: For it is very probable, that <HI>other Churches may be better acquainted with Per&s;ons and Cau&s;es</HI> than our&s;elves; and therefore <HI>their Judgment and Coun&s;el ought to be required.</HI> Thus particularly, <HI>when a new Church is to be gathered,</HI>

<P>Furthermore; It may be remarked, that in the <HI>Set|tlement of new Churches, in the Ordination of Officers in the &s;ame Churches, and in giving the Right Hand of Fel|low&s;hip,</HI> of the Fellow&s;hip of the Churches, from Time to Time, the&s;e Churches have &s;o often plainly, &s;ignifi|cantly and formally <HI>renewed their Original Pact or Covenant.</HI></P>

I &s;hall not here cice any Authority for the Proof of this; intending in an Appendix to this Book to reprint &s;omething referring to this Matter from Dr. INCREASE MATHER'S, my Grandfather's, <HI>Vindication of the Order of the Churches in</HI> New-England; but I &s;hall briefly mention a Con&s;ideration or two, which will be &s;ufficient to <HI>e&s;tabli&s;h this Proce&s;s of Di&s;cipline</HI> in the good Opinion of all &s;uch as are the true Friends of the&s;e Churches.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t of all;</HI> This Proce&s;s is entirely <HI>agreable to the Nature and De&s;ign of the Go&s;pel,</HI> as well as the Rea&s;on of Mankind: For what is it for <HI>one Church to admoni&s;h another</HI> on the Account of &s;omething judg'd to be ami&s;s in their Society? It is only for a Neighbour <HI>Mini&s;ter,</HI> or Elder, with a few of his <HI>Chri&s;tian Brethren</HI> to pay a Vi&s;it to the Neighbour Church and humbly advi&s;e and exhort them to <HI>&s;eek for the Re&s;toration of Peace and to rectify their Errors whether in Judgment or Action.</HI> How rational and how Evangelical is this Method? What A&s;&s;uming, what Domineering is there to be found in this? Truely, notwith&s;tanding the frightful Dre&s;s in which this Proce&s;s is repre&s;ented, there is <HI>nothing more Authoritative in it, than one Bro|ther's admoni&s;hing</HI> another, according to the Rules of the Go&s;pel as well as of right Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Again; This Method is <HI>well calculated for pre&s;erv|ing the Reputation and Honour of particular Churches:</HI> For, as <HI>particular Chri&s;tians,</HI> &s;o <HI>particular Churches,</HI> are but <HI>Men</HI> and by Con&s;equence are <HI>liable to Errors:</HI> But yet, as all Chri&s;tians make an high Profe&s;&s;ion and therefore &s;hould be careful le&s;t there &s;hould be any &s;lur upon it; even &s;o all <HI>particular Churches,</HI> which are <HI>corporate Societies</HI> making a &s;plendid Profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity, <HI>ought carefully to maintain their Social Ho|nour:</HI> And therefore, as with <HI>particular Chri&s;tian Bre|thren,</HI> &s;o with <HI>particular Churches,</HI> fallen into Errors and Scandals, it would be wrong and injurious to take <HI>at once precipitate and open Mea&s;ures:</HI> Nor indeed would <HI>expo&s;ing their Character openly</HI> at fir&s;t be either a <HI>regular
<PB N="139" REF="004275_0156_1004336FF55E6A20">or a probable Method of effecting their Amendment:</HI> Wherefore, in order to pre&s;erve the Reputation and Honour of the&s;e Churches, <HI>it is va&s;tly better,</HI> I mean more <HI>rational and &s;criptural,</HI> in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, <HI>to follow this private Method,</HI> to which by our Con&s;titution al&s;o we are directed, than <HI>as the Manner of &s;ome is</HI> to bring the Affairs of a Church <HI>before a Council and to a public Hearing at once.</HI></P>
<P>And, in fine, If <HI>this Di&s;ciplinary Method be not care|fully ob&s;erved, the&s;e Churches have no Remedy at all again&s;t Male-Admini&s;trations in particular Churches:</HI> For I cannot find, that by the Con&s;titution of the&s;e Churches the <HI>Power of calling Councils belongs to any particular Per&s;ons</HI> in them, but to the <HI>Churches them|&s;elves:</HI> So that, according to this Con&s;titution, if there be <HI>Male-Admini&s;tration in any particular Church, the Aggrieved Members of it may not convoke &s;uch A&s;&s;em|blies:</HI> But they &s;hould de&s;ire the Advice and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Neighbour Church: And, unle&s;s <HI>one particular Church interpo&s;e</HI> in this State of Things and enquire into the Ca&s;e in <HI>the Way of Communion by Admonition,</HI> particular <HI>Churches may remain at eternal Variance within them&s;elves</HI> without &s;hewing our Di&s;like of their Proceedings: For there is <HI>no other Proce&s;s</HI> that we know of in the publi&s;h'd Order of our Churches, by which we can <HI>te&s;tify again&s;t them, but in this Di&s;cipli|nary Method.</HI></P>
<P>But, after all, &s;ome of our good Brethren will con|tinue di&s;plea&s;ed with this Proce&s;s of Di&s;cipline <HI>from a peaccable Di&s;po&s;ition,</HI> as &s;hould &s;eem from their Di&s;cour&s;e about it: For they &s;ay, that <HI>they cannot by any means approve of this Di&s;ciplinary Method; becau&s;e the Pro&s;e|cution of it will occa&s;ion great Di&s;turbance and Confu&s;ion in Churches.</HI></P>
<P>But, for An&s;wer to the&s;e Per&s;ons, it may be <HI>worth the while to expo&s;tulate</HI> a little with them: Say then. Dear Brethren, <HI>why do you think that this Proce&s;s &s;hould occa&s;ion more Trouble and Con&s;u&s;ion</HI> than <HI>the
<PB N="140" REF="004275_0157_10043373DAB19288">Method of calling a Council by a few particular Per&s;ons, or even by one Per&s;on,</HI> di&s;&s;atisfied or aggrieved? Or is it, becau&s;e your own <HI>Admini&s;trations have bin irregular or-un&s;uitable,</HI> that you are therefore di&s;affected to this Proce&s;s, from a prevalent <HI>Fear of Examination</HI> accord|ing to it? However, is not <HI>this Di&s;ciplinary Method</HI> &s;o <HI>plainly pre&s;cribed</HI> in the Con&s;titution of particular Con|gregational Churches that we mu&s;t be <HI>Browni&s;ts</HI> or Nothing if we recede from it? And, in fine, if it &s;hould be &s;o, as you &s;ay, that <HI>Churches will be di&s;turbed in the Pro&s;ecution of this Method;</HI> yet can we &s;uppo&s;e, that <HI>&s;ome Di&s;turbance of the Churches in a &s;leepy and indolent State</HI> would be ami&s;s and unde&s;irable, <HI>if a more e&s;tabli&s;h'd Order and a more comely Amendment may be occa&s;ion'd</HI> thro' this Di&s;turbance in the Churches? Pray, dear Brethren, an&s;wer the&s;e Que&s;tions <HI>in the Spirit of Meekne&s;s,</HI> as they are propo&s;ed; that &s;o, if our Fathers erred in the Pre&s;cription of this Method, the Churches may regularly u&s;e their Endeavours to get their Error rectified.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, and from the be&s;t Ob&s;ervations which I have bin able to make; I am free to declare my Apprehen&s;ion, and I hope my Brethren will not be offended with me for making this Decla|ration, that <HI>the Neglect and Slight of this Rule of Di&s;cipline by the Pa&s;tors and Churches in this Go|vernment has bin the true Rea&s;on,</HI> if not the &s;ole Cau&s;e, <HI>of the Di&s;turbances and Confu&s;ions in many of our Churches,</HI> and that, as the great VOET ob&s;erved with re&s;pect to the <HI>Want of Corre&s;pondence among the Chur|ches, I fear it much: Time will &s;hew what will happen, when the Number of Churches is greatly encrea&s;ed, and one will not bear another</HI> <NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">Nole&mdash;Mordicus certare, quamdiu bene &s;e habent: Now equidem invideo; metuo magis; &amp; Dies docebit quid futurum &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in ingentem Numerum excieverint &amp; OUDEIS OUDENOS AKOUSH.

<HEAD><HI>THE CONCLUSION,</HI> in a brief Addre&s;s to the Churches of <HI>NEW-ENGLAND.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THUS I have endeavoured to &s;tate and vindicate the more di&s;tingui&s;hing Liberties of the Chur|ches in <HI>New-England.</HI> As <HI>the&s;e Privileges</HI> have bin <HI>purcha&s;ed by the Blood of the LORD JESUS,</HI> they <HI>ought to be very precious in our E&s;teem,</HI> nor upon any Pretence what&s;oever to be &s;lighted and undervalued by the <HI>happy People</HI> who enjoy them.</P>
<P>It is worthy to be always remembred by the&s;e Chur|ches, that it was not on the Account of any <HI>peculiar Sentiments in Doctrinal Matters</HI> that our wi&s;e and good Fathers left their Native Countrey and came into this then howling Wilderne&s;s: For they agreed to the <HI>Doc|trinal Articles of the Church of</HI> England <HI>as much as the</HI> Conformi&s;ts <HI>to that Parliamentary Church,</HI> and indeed much more &s;o than mo&s;t of them: But it was from a <HI>pure Re&s;pect to Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Di&s;cipline and Order and to a more refined Wor&s;hip,</HI> that tho&s;e excellent Men our Ance&s;tors tran&s;ported them&s;elves, with their Families, into this Land.</P>
<P>The Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> as far as in them lies, have <HI>dive&s;ted our great SAVIOUR of His Prophetical, Sacer|dotal and Kingly Offices: Other Churches</HI> have bin &s;o far overcome by the Light of Rea&s;on and Revelation, that they have re&s;tored as one may &s;ay <HI>His Sacerdotal Office</HI> to Him and <HI>His Prophetical Office</HI> ol&s;o: But our graci|ous Predece&s;&s;ors, ob&s;erving that their Brethen in <HI>Eng|land</HI> were not willing to allow our Lord JESUS CHRIST to be <HI>the King and Ruler of His Church,</HI> nobly re&s;olv'd,
<PB N="143" REF="004275_0160_1004337D729E2910">as <HI>the Children of</HI> Zion, <HI>to acknowlege and rejoyce in their King:</HI> And hence they quitted their ungrateful Countrey, that &s;o they might ob&s;erve that <HI>refin'd Wor|&s;hip and Order</HI> which their LORD and Sovereign had in His Word appointed to be ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>It follows therefore, that any <HI>Degeneracies from the pure Wor&s;hip and Scriptural Order</HI> in the&s;e Churches would be a direct <HI>Rejection of the Kingly Authority of CHRIST JESUS, and a Means of &s;etting up another King or Captain to lead us backward, in the Steps we have taken from</HI> Babylon, <HI>towards it</HI> again: May GOD of His rich Grace therefore pre&s;erve the&s;e Churches from any &s;uch Degeneracies!</P>
<P>It is evident indeed, that great Pains are taken to <HI>draw our People,</HI> e&s;pecially our incon&s;iderate <HI>young People,</HI> who are too unmindful of the King and GOD of their Fathers, <HI>from their Love and Attachment to tho&s;e fir&s;t Principles of the&s;e Churches,</HI> which I have bin ex|plaining and enforcing: But, as NABOTH &s;aid to AHAB concerning his Vineyard, in 1 King. XXI. 3, <HI>The LORD forbid it me, that I &s;hould give the Inheri|tance of my Fathers unto Thee;</HI> even &s;o it is fit, that we &s;hould &s;ay to &s;uch as would entice us to part with the pure Order of the&s;e Churches, <HI>This was our Fa|ther's Inheritance:</HI> And GOD forbid, that any &s;hould per&s;uade us to give up our ine&s;timable Rights: For the very Thought of parting with them is &s;hocking.</P>
<P>Dear People, The Liberties, which have bin chal|leng'd for you, are the &s;ame as the Brethren in the Times of primitive Chri&s;tianity enjoyed for <HI>hundreds of Years</HI> together: And, whatever &s;pecious Pretences &s;ome may make to the contrary, the <HI>Di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing of the Brethren</HI> of the&s;e their valuable Liberties was a <HI>con&s;ide|rable In&s;tance of the Romi&s;h Apo&s;tocy:</HI> And indeed they have but a &s;lender Acquaintance with Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory who do not know, that <HI>the Ri&s;e of Popery</HI> was owing to the <HI>People's tamely giving up their Rights and Privileges,</HI> either thro' Ignorance or Imprudence, <HI>to
<PB N="144" REF="004275_0161_1004337EF662E1D0">the Clergy,</HI> who unrea&s;onably engro&s;s'd to them&s;elves and gra&s;p'd in their own Clutches all Things in the Churches that were of any Worth and Importance.</P>
<P>There can be no Doubt, that there are many who are <HI>&s;worn and inveterate Enemies to the pure Order</HI> in the&s;e Churches; and, be&s;ides the&s;e, we have Rea&s;on to think that there are <HI>many fal&s;e Friends</HI> to it; by which Sort I mean tho&s;e that <HI>pretend &s;ome Regard to the Order of the Go&s;pel</HI> in the&s;e Churches, but yet at the &s;ame Time <HI>would gladly &s;ubvert it:</HI> And it is well, if there are not <HI>&s;undry Mini&s;ters</HI> in the&s;e Churches, who are di&s;affected to it: For, as LUTHER has &s;omewhere re|mark'd concerning <HI>Religion, Nunquam magis pericli|tur quam inter Reverendi&s;&s;imos;</HI> &s;o it may be &s;aid with re&s;pect to <HI>the Order</HI> in the&s;e Churches: <HI>Probably it may be in mo&s;t Danger from &s;ome of the</HI> Reverend Body.&mdash; But &s;urely all &s;uch in the&s;e Churches are very unad|vi&s;ed and blameworthy: And, if they are not duely <HI>&s;en&s;ible of the Tendency of their Di&s;affection and Under|takings,</HI> it is a Pity but their Brethren &s;hould, and carefully guard again&s;t them. And truely there cannot any Good be expected from them: For, as they do not produce a <HI>better Di&s;cipline and purer Order</HI> for our Churches in the Room of that, which they unrea&s;ona|bly di&s;like and would throw away; &s;o, if they could produce and offer a <HI>better Order,</HI> which indeed is very unlikely, there is no rational Pro&s;pect of its gaining Ground among us, but with that <HI>Di&s;turbance and Con|&s;u&s;ion in our Churches,</HI> of which they at other Times are exceedingly fearful. But,</P>

<P>I Have a Letter in my Hands, and the very Origi|nal Letter, of the learned and pious and facetious Mr. CHARLES MORTON of <HI>Charles-Town</HI> in <HI>New-England;</HI> a Letter to the Right Honourable HUGH BOSCAWEN, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> which, as it gives a large and true
<PB N="148" REF="004275_0165_1004338B13D721D0">Account of the Countrey and Churches in <HI>New-En|gland,</HI> I had &s;ome Thoughts of Printing: But, finding that it will take up more Room than can well be allow'd, I &s;hall therefore only &s;elect a few Paragraphs from it. And, if any upon the Sight of The&s;e &s;hould want to &s;ee the Remainder of the Letter, I would here acquaint them, that I have it in my Library and &s;hall he ready to give them the Sight of it.

<LETTER>
<P>&mdash;Give me Leave, Sir, to acquaint you, that I am now <HI>in a Countrey,</HI> which has bin a friendly <HI>A&s;ylum</HI> to me: It gave me a kind Reception, when my Native Land did in a Manner pu&s;h me out. &mdash; It's my humble Petition to your Honour, that you would be|come a vigorous Patron for the People of GOD in the&s;e remote Lands. &mdash; GOD has <HI>a great People</HI> here, an <HI>able and pious Mini&s;try,</HI> and a great many <HI>well order'd Chur|ches.</HI> Their <HI>Church Government</HI> is <HI>interpendant,</HI> as their witty Mr. WARD called it. &mdash; I have bin called to &s;ome of their <HI>Councils</HI> and have &s;een their good Effect in healing the Breaches of di&s;turbed Churches. Their <HI>Ordination</HI> to the public Mini&s;try is &s;olemn by the Pa&s;tors of Neighbour Churches: And, tho' their Cu&s;tom has bin a new Impo&s;ition of Hands upon every new Call to the Exerci&s;e of the Mini&s;try; yet to us, who came from <HI>Europe,</HI> Mr. BAYLEY and my&s;elf, it was abated.

<P>THe next Te&s;timony &s;hall be from my own Father, who, in a Letter to Mr. FRANCIS DE LA PILLONNIERE, which was printed in <HI>The Occa&s;ional Paper,</HI> but never printed and generally known in <HI>New-England,</HI> writes in the following Manner.</P>
<P>&mdash;The Truth is, the Reformation that came on, when the <HI>Romi&s;h Antichri&s;t</HI> had pa&s;s'd thro' his Time, and his <HI>Two Times,</HI> and was entering into his <HI>Half-Time,</HI> was little better than an <HI>Half-Reformation.</HI></P>
<P>The Reforming Churches, flying from <HI>Rome,</HI> carried, &s;ome of them more, &s;ome of them le&s;s, all of them &s;omething, of <HI>Rome,</HI> with them; e&s;pecially in that Spirit of <HI>Impo&s;ition,</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ecution,</HI> which has too much cleaved unto them ALL.</P>
<P>The Period ha&s;tens for a <HI>New Reformation;</HI> wherein 'tis likely that our holy Lord will, in &s;ome Degree,
<PB N="150" REF="004275_0167_1004338F5E1C6790">reject ALL the <HI>Parties</HI> of Chri&s;tians at this Day in the World; and form a NEW PEOPLE of the good Men in the <HI>&s;everal Parties,</HI> who &s;hall unite in the Articles of their Goodne&s;s, and &s;weetly bear with one another in their le&s;&s;er Differences; leaving each other to the Divine Illuminations.</P>
<P>PIETY will anon be the only <HI>Ba&s;is of Union,</HI> in the Churches of the revived, refined, reformed Reforma|tion; and pious Men, in &s;everal Forms, will come to Love, and live, as Brethren; and the purged Floor of our Saviour will be vi&s;ited with Tokens of his Pre|&s;ence, that &s;hall be very comfortable.</P>
<P>It is thus very much in my Country; and therefore, Sir, if <HI>Old England</HI> prove too torrid a Climate for you, come over to <HI>New-England,</HI> where I will do my be&s;t, that you &s;hall be treated with more Chri&s;tian Civilities.</P>
<P>But I hope that our Lord will find greater Employ|ments for you in <HI>Europe,</HI> than can be expected on the We&s;tern Side of the <HI>Atlantick.</HI> He has qualify'd you for them, and, I hope, what you have &s;een among &s;ome very <HI>Defective Prote&s;tants</HI> will animate you to them.</P>
<P>Being my &s;elf a <HI>Calvini&s;t,</HI> I mu&s;t needs differ pretty much from a Gentleman who profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf an <HI>Ar|minian.</HI> But I con&s;ider what tho&s;e <HI>Maxims of Piety</HI> are, which engage the <HI>Arminian</HI> to maintain his di&s;|tingui&s;hing Po&s;itions. Tho&s;e Maxims are, <HI>That</HI> the Holy and Sin-hating Lord mu&s;t not be reproach'd as the Impeller of the Sin, whereof he is the <HI>Revenger: That</HI> our Merciful Father mu&s;t not be bla&s;phemed, as if He dealt after an illu&s;ory manner with Men, when He invites them to His Mercy: <HI>That</HI> none, among the Fallen Race of the <HI>Fir&s;t Adam,</HI> are to be &s;hut out from the Hopes of Life, in the Death of the <HI>Second Adam: That</HI> impenitent Unbelievers mu&s;t not ca&s;t on God the Blame of their Unbelief; but the Wicked mu&s;t lay wholly on them&s;elves the Fault of their own De&s;truction: And, <HI>That</HI> Men mu&s;t work out their
<PB N="151" REF="004275_0168_10043390E4986880">own Salvation with as much Indu&s;try, and Agony, and Vigilancy, as if all turned upon their own Will and Care, whether they &s;hall be &s;aved, or no. Now, the&s;e are <HI>Maxims,</HI> which every pious <HI>Calvini&s;t</HI> will al&s;o mo&s;t heartily con&s;ent unto. And, if I &s;hould repeat the <HI>Maxims of Piety,</HI> which make me fall in with the Po&s;i|tions of a <HI>Calvini&s;t,</HI> as requi&s;ite unto the &s;upporting of them. I am confident the pious Mr. <HI>de la Pillonniere</HI> would mo&s;t heartily &s;ub&s;cribe unto them. And we &s;hall both of us have the Mode&s;ty to confe&s;s, that we have al&s;o to do with Matters which are to us incom|prehen&s;ible. Now, if good Men are &s;o united in the <HI>Maxims,</HI> which are the END, for the &s;erving whereof they declare that they pur&s;ue their Controver&s;ies; why &s;hould not this <HI>Uniting Piety</HI> put an End unto their Controver&s;ies? and beat <HI>their Swords into Plough-Shares, and their Spears into Pruning-Hooks?</HI></P>

<P>BUT, to the&s;e more particular Te&s;timonies concern|ing the Catholic and comprehen&s;ive Principles of the&s;e Churches from a &s;uperior Regard to <HI>the Sub&s;tance of Religion,</HI> I would take Leave to &s;ubjoin and mention &s;ome more <HI>General ones.</HI></P>
<P>The famous DURY, who&s;e Heart was very much &s;et upon a Pacification among <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> having made his propo&s;ed Tour in <HI>Europe</HI> for promoting it, at length wrote a Letter to his Brethren in <HI>New-England</HI> to know their Sentiments concerning &s;uch a Pacifica|tion; which Letter occa&s;ioned the following noble An&s;wer to it, that was written by the great Mr. NORTON, Pa&s;tor of the fir&s;t Church in <HI>Bo&s;ton, New-En|gland,</HI> at the De&s;ire of all the Mini&s;ters of this [then] <HI>Colony,</HI> and afterwards &s;igned by them all. I have here reprinted the Engli&s;h Tran&s;lation of this Letter,
<PB N="152" REF="004275_0169_1004339731A390B8">that &s;o it might be of more general Advantage: But, for the &s;ake of the Learned, I have in&s;erted in the Margin &s;everal of the Emphatical Pa&s;&s;ages in it from the <HI>Original Latin,</HI> which, I think, was never pub|li&s;h'd. <HI>N. B.</HI> If any Per&s;on has a Mind to &s;ee <HI>the Original Latin Letter,</HI> with the Names of the Mini&s;ters &s;ub&s;cribing it in their own Hand-Writing, and will be &s;o good as to repair to me for the Sight of it, I &s;hall readily gratify them with it.</P>

<P>THAT among&s;t &s;o many horrid Alarms of War, among&s;t &s;o many fatal Differences of Opinion rai&s;ed in Matters of Religion, and that al&s;o after &s;o many, and &s;uch unwearied Labours of famous Inter|ce&s;&s;ors, now &s;o often in this Cau&s;e undertaken in vain; you &s;hould O <HI>Dury,</HI> the mo&s;t zealous Friend of Peace, not only be &s;eriou&s;ly thinking of, but are al&s;o unto this Day &s;trongly endeavouring the E&s;pou&s;als of Truth and Peace between the Profe&s;&s;ors of the Go&s;pel; we verily do largely congratulate you in the conceiving &s;o great a De&s;ign, with our utmo&s;t, and daily Prayers, helping forward (by God's A&s;&s;i&s;tance) the Birth of this Man|child. Suffer us to &s;peak the very Truth of the Mat|ter, nor is there any need to deny the &s;ame: Even as the Holy Scripture relates how the Olive Branch, brought much Comfort to the Parent of the other World after the Flood, while he was lamenting over the Tremendous Spectacle of the Deluge overflowing all here below; in like Manner did your Letter, breathing a very Spirit of Peace, as another <HI>Noah</HI>'s Dove, &s;ent down from Heaven, wonderfully refre&s;h the exile Brethren, who were almo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee &s;o
<PB N="153" REF="004275_0170_100406B2A552DEE0">many Nations, that profe&s;s the Go&s;pel, making irrecon|cileable War among&s;t them&s;elves, together with the many and great Di&s;&s;entions in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Religion, and that mon&s;trous Flood of Error breaking forth, not out of the Cataracts of the Clouds, but the very Mouth of the Dragon.</P>
<P>Be it &s;o, that we are in the utmo&s;t Parts of the Earth; we have only changed our Climate, not our Minds: We have altered our Place, that we might retain the Faith without alteration. There are indeed &s;ome, that might have been better employed, at lea&s;t meer Strangers to our Affairs, who do therefore impute unto us the Guilt of Schi&s;m, becau&s;e in the fir&s;t Place we have endea|voured after the pure Wor&s;hip of God. But if any &s;ee good to enquire into the Rea&s;on, why the&s;e Churches in the Wilderne&s;s left their Country, this it was, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Ancient Faith, and pure Wor&s;hip, might be found in&s;eparable Companions in our Practice, and that our Po&s;terity might be undefiled in Religion: Neverthele&s;s, we are never unmindful of the Saying of <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> to the Brethren in the Wilderne&s;s, as he &s;tyles them; <HI>There are two Things con&s;iderable,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>Con&s;cience and good Name: Con&s;cience as nece&s;&s;ary for thy &s;elf, good Name for thy Neighbour:</HI> He who tru&s;ts to his Con&s;cience, and neglects his good Name, is cruel, e&s;pecially if he be &s;et in that Place, of which the Apo&s;tle writing to his Di&s;ciple, &s;aith, <HI>In all Things &s;hew thy &s;elf an Example of good Works.</HI> It may not be unlawful for us, who are in the Wilderne&s;s on the further &s;ide of the Seas, as well as tho&s;e, who through Grace are called to the Mini&s;try, though in our &s;elves the greate&s;t of Sinners, and the lea&s;t of all the Saints, as any others, to Apologize for our &s;elves in the Words of the Tribes beyond Jordan a little changed, for the vindicating or pre&s;erving our good Name in a Matter of &s;o great Moment, both be|fore great ones, Fathers, Brethren, and every gentle Reader, <HI>The Lord God of Gods, the Lord God of Gods he knows, and I&s;rael &s;hall know, if wittingly and willing|ly
<PB N="154" REF="004275_0171_10043398B53300D8">in Rebellion, or treacherous dealing again&s;t the Lord, or in Schi&s;m it be, that we have departed from our Coun|try, &s;ave us not this Day.</HI></P>
<P>But yet notwith&s;tanding, we are not unmindful of that &s;o known Oracle, <HI>[Love the Truth and Peace:]</HI> We neither &s;trive for Truth without making Reckon|ing of Peace, neither do we pur&s;ue Peace with the Lo&s;s of Truth: The former defaceth, this latter teareth the &s;eamle&s;s Coat of the Church. It is as nece&s;&s;ary to avoid the Rock of Schi&s;m on the Right Hand, as the Quick&s;ands of Confu&s;ion on the Left. We renounce <HI>Samaritani&s;m,</HI> that deadly &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">k of fal&s;e Doctrine, as much as we fly from <HI>Donati&s;m,</HI> the &s;ore Enemy of Evangelical Temperament, and Devourer (if we may &s;peak after <HI>Tertullian</HI>) of Chri&s;tian Society; but admire and embrace the Concord, and Agreement of the Go&s;pel. We are no whit plea&s;ed with <HI>Ca&s;&s;anders</HI> &s;hak|ing Hands with Papi&s;ts at the furthe&s;t Di&s;tance, erring from the Truth; nor yet with the Romani&s;t renouncing Communion with them that are otherwi&s;e minded in le&s;&s;er Differences: But in &s;pecial Manner we ought to labour, that we may walk with an even Foot, and not to turn a&s;ide an Hair's breadth from the Truth: In the mean Time, it is better to be a <HI>Cyprian</HI> than a <HI>Steven.</HI> It is much more grievous to think aright, and be found a Schi&s;matick, than to think ami&s;s in Things not funda|mental, and be of a peaceable Spirit. The Spirit of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is a Spirit of Truth, of Peace and Communion: So de&s;irous of Peace, that it requi|reth Communion in a true Church, although not pure; and &s;o de&s;irous of Truth, that it forbids impurity in any Church what&s;oever. That, that is the Mark at which we aim, and which we endeavour and breath after, in him who is <HI>the Way, the Truth and Life.</HI></P>
<P>It is confe&s;&s;ed, there are &s;ome <HI>Apices,</HI> or le&s;&s;er Points in Divinity, which the Church of God hath now for above an hundred Years bewailed, as the ob&s;tacles of Peace, concerning which the chief Controver&s;ies main|tained
<PB N="155" REF="004275_0172_1004339A4039ADA0">are about Prede&s;tination, Ubiquity, and the Eu|chari&s;t. About the&s;e Points how many thou&s;and Pole|mick Writings have been extant all abroad, which the Chri&s;tian World is &s;carce able to contain? Alas! that ever there &s;hould be a War about the Sacrament! Alas! that ever there &s;hould be any contentious Treati&s;es about the Euchari&s;t, turning the very Badge of Union into an Apple of Contention! Who can refrain from Tears at the uttering of &s;uch Things? Yet the&s;e not|with&s;tanding, that there is Place for the &s;o much de&s;ired Coalition between the Evangelicks and the Reformed, &s;o called, may ea&s;ily be made appear, by running thro' the chief Heads of Things:</P>
<P>As namely, Becau&s;e in the fir&s;t Article, they who were the greate&s;t Favourers of that eminent Worthy of the former Age, do yet a&s;cribe the Work of Conver&s;ion wholly unto God, and do likewi&s;e &s;tifly maintain, and accurately defend, Grace to be altogether free; who were al&s;o utter Enemies to that pe&s;tilent Opinion of the Schoolmen, <HI>[That God is bound to him that doth what he can of him&s;elf.]</HI> And who likewi&s;e do de&s;ervedly ac|count it meer Pelagiani&s;m, to make any kind of Quali|fying Fitne&s;s a Moral Motive unto predetermining Grace.</P>
<P>As for the Opinion of the Ubiquity of the Humane Nature, by Virtue of the Hypo&s;tatical Union; it can|not be denied, but that Papers have come abroad, written with too much Gall and &s;harpne&s;s. In the mean while it is agreed upon by all, and taken for granted, That the Humane Nature is Per&s;onally Om|nipre&s;ent. According to this Rule likewi&s;e are other Propo&s;itions about the Per&s;on to be judged of, under this Head.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, As concerning the Lord's Supper; the Di|vines of either Part, do reject Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, to|gether with wor&s;hipping of Bread. But about the Real Pre&s;ence, <HI>viz.</HI> Sacramental, of the Body and Blood of Chri&s;t, it is agreed between both. The&s;e &s;o many and
<PB N="156" REF="004275_0173_1004339BF44B6BB0">great Differences, are to be accounted as &s;o many Heart-griefs, altho' not to be numbred among&s;t them which by the Apo&s;tle are called <HI>Unlearned Que&s;tions;</HI> yet we judge them not to be of that Moment, as to hinder the giving each other the Right Hand of Fellow&s;hip, or the Pledges of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Brotherhood <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Tot &amp; talia Di&s;&s;idia tot fatemur Cordelia;&mdash;Tanti autem e&s;&s;e, quo minus dextras daretur jungere Dextris, &amp; mutua audire &amp; red ere Fraternitatis Eccle&s;ia&s;tica Symbola, minime judicamus.</NOTE>, building upon that Apo&s;tolical Canon of holy Communion, <HI>Ne|verthele&s;s, in that whereunto we have attained, let us walk by the &s;ame Rule, let us mind the &s;ame Thing,</HI> Phil. 3.16.

<P>We account it very unequal to fa&s;ten upon any one that holds an Opinion all the Con&s;ectaries, which to him that argues according to the exacte&s;t Grounds of Rea&s;on, &s;eem to follow upon &s;uch Premi&s;es, e&s;pecially if tho&s;e Con&s;equences be di&s;owned by him: In which re&s;pect there are no &s;mall Errors on both Sides, while tho&s;e of our Side impeach the other of <HI>Eutyches</HI> his Opinion, tho' refu&s;ing to own it, for the &s;ake of Con|&s;ub&s;tantiation; and they on the other Side go about to make ours guilty of making God the Author of Sin, altho' we never &s;o much di&s;claim it, in the Point of Prede&s;tination. The Di&s;putes about the Con&s;equences of the&s;e, whether rightly inferred or not, from the Pre|mi&s;es, belong not to this Place to be examined, yea the Matter it&s;elf requires rather that we &s;hould for|bear.</P>
<P>But this Tragedy is not yet at an End. For, as to Polity, and indifferent Things, they have taken up divers Opinions; who it were to be wi&s;hed that they would embrace that Concord one with another, which
<PB N="157" REF="004275_0174_100433A108CFB4F0">hath been &s;o often endeavoured after. But the Differ|ences of this Nature, as they are not &s;o &s;mall, that the Lovers of Truth &s;hould be &s;ilent about them; &s;o nei|ther are they &s;o great, that they need be any hindrance to the Seekers of Peace and Quietne&s;s in the pre&s;ent Undertaking; as may appear by the unque&s;tioned Ex|ample of our Saviour, who refu&s;ed not to celebrate the Wor&s;hip of God in the Jewi&s;h Church, defaced at that Time with more grievous Corruptions. They who are united to Chri&s;t by Heart-converting Grace, are Mem|bers of his My&s;tical Body; and who&s;oever, but in appearance at lea&s;t, are joyned to the Head, and have added them&s;elves to the Polity of I&s;rael, are to be re|ceived Members of the Political Body. Now Com|munion follows upon Union. Be&s;ides the Nature of Political, as well as Chri&s;tian Society, doth utterly for|bid to deny the Privileges of Fellow&s;hip to &s;uch Mem|bers as are found without Scandal.</P>
<P>Thus much we thought good to &s;peak briefly about this Point, that Honoured Per&s;ons, and Re&s;pected Brethren, might under&s;tand what Rea&s;ons moved us to entertain the &s;ame Opinion with them&s;elves. We have been taught, that <HI>the Idea, or Pattern of holy Communion ought to be fetched from Divine Writ, and not to be framed after our own Plea&s;ure <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Communion is Sanctae Ideam a Divina Pagina petendam, non pro Arbitrio no&s;tro cudendam didicimus.</NOTE>.</HI></P>
<P>The Rules of Sacred Society are certain; beyond which, or &s;hort of which, it is not in our Power to extend, or withold the Right Hand of Brotherhood. Whoever having attained the&s;e &s;hall acknowledge them; and having acknowledged them, &s;hall walk according unto them; &s;o holding Communion with Sinners, as he doth not in the lea&s;t communicate with their Sins, &s;o as he is wanting neither to the Truth, nor to him|&s;elf, nor his Brethren, him we de&s;ervedly e&s;teem both as a Guide and Pillar of the Church: Whether we will
<PB N="158" REF="004275_0175_100433A3BB405D90">or no, we are Brethren; and &s;eeing we are Brethren, let us acknowledge our &s;elves what we are, namely, <HI>Brethren in the Lord.</HI> A Day would &s;carce &s;uffice, to rehear&s;e how many and how great incitements do call for, and require this. To account the weak in Faith for none, is indeed it&s;elf a greater Weakne&s;s. The Name of Brethren is &s;weet: It is Matter of great Delight to be &s;uch indeed. But it is much to be lamented, that tho&s;e who are &s;o, &s;hould not be acknowledged to be &s;o. <HI>So to &s;tand for Truth, that by too tenacious in&s;i&s;ting upon Doctrine, we make no reckoning of the Rights of Society, is to be carried with the Study of Parties, not of the Truth <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Veritatem item Operam dare, ut Doctrinae tenacius inhae|rendo Societatis Jura &s;u&s;que deque faciamus, e&s;t Partes ager's non veritati &s;tudere.</NOTE>;</HI> and to undertake the Patronage of an Opi|nion, rather becau&s;e it is our own, than becau&s;e it is true.</P>
<P>Sounder Philo&s;ophy determines, that the excellency of Union is to be e&s;teemed according to the Dignity of the Cau&s;e. We here pa&s;s over in Silence the con&s;piring together of the Waters and dry Land to make one Globe; as al&s;o that of the Frame of the Heavenly and the Earthly Globe, to make one Sphere of the World. There may be found an heap of Miracles in the quiet gathering the living Creatures into the Ark, and there abiding in it, where the mo&s;t &s;avage of them laid a&s;ide their &s;avagene&s;s; being ready to acknowledge <HI>Noah</HI> for their Lord (not much otherwi&s;e than <HI>Adam</HI> in giv|ing Names unto them) where might be &s;een the Wolf &s;tanding among&s;t the Sheep, neither do the Flocks &s;eem afraid of the great Lyons: The&s;e are indeed very great Things; but yet if they be compared with the My&s;tical Union, &s;hining forth in one of the very lea&s;t of Chri&s;t's Members, there would want Words to ex|pre&s;s how great the Di&s;tance is. To proceed there|fore, if the Union of a very few Believers be of &s;o
<PB N="159" REF="004275_0176_100406B6D0F73B30">great Moment, of how great Account &s;hould be the Uniting of all Prote&s;tants in the Faith? But let here pau&s;e a while, and not think much to weigh this Mat|ter a little more &s;eriou&s;ly, and we &s;hall find (unle&s;s we are much deceived) this very Union about which we are treating, if it be without Hypocri&s;y and Deceit, but as the very Off-&s;pring and Image of the Hypo&s;ta|tical Union, and only next unto it on Earth (as to the Kind) and like unto which there will not be found any in Heaven, no not when Angelical Nature remained in its Perfection. We do believe indeed, and not out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a vain Conceit, That this Agreement is a bright Look|ing-Gla&s;s made of the Blood of the Lamb, wherein Je&s;us him&s;elf, the Prince of &s;o great a Peace, clearly &s;hines forth: In pa&s;&s;ing through which al&s;o, he doth irradiate the World with its brightne&s;s, while it &s;ted|fa&s;tly beholds this clear Looking-Gla&s;s, and by irradi|ating, ingenerates Faith therein.

<P>If the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch a Peace &s;hould appear, we could not do much in the pur&s;uing the Nece&s;&s;ity there|of. Notwith&s;tanding (if we may have Leave) that this Nece&s;&s;ity may be fa&s;tned in our Minds, as they &s;ay, with the &s;tronge&s;t Nail, before we leave this ex|hortatory Part of our Di&s;cour&s;e, we think meet, for a Conclu&s;ion, to adorn and &s;trengthen it with the Sayings of &s;ome famous Men, tending much unto Peace.</P>

<PB N="167" REF="004275_0184_100433B8E5955680">the&s;e Churches, I would a&s;k Leave of the Reader to refer him to the <HI>New-England Chronology</HI> of the learned and accurate Mr. PRINCE of <HI>Bo&s;ton;</HI> in Pages the <HI>Eighty eighth, Eighty ninth, Ninetieth, Ninety fir&s;t, Ninety &s;econd</HI> and <HI>Ninety third</HI> of which Chronology he will find abundant Satisfaction upon this Head.</P>

<HEAD>Part the &s;econd, containing <HI>the Proofs and Evidences of a Con&s;ociation of Churches</HI> among the&s;e Churches for their mutual Light and A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</HEAD>
<P>IN the <HI>twenty fir&s;t</HI> Page of <HI>The Di&s;cour&s;e concerning Congregational Churches</HI> I have affirmed, that the&s;e Churches acknowledge <HI>a Con&s;ociation of Churches for imparting mutual Light and A&s;&s;i&s;tance:</HI> And in the <HI>Eighth</HI> Chapter of this Book I have maintain'd the &s;ame Thing. Now, for the more full Proof and Con|firmation of this Point, I &s;hall here reprint from my honoured Grandfather's Book, entitled, <HI>The Order of the Churches in</HI> New-England <HI>vindicated,</HI> his An&s;wer to this Que&s;tion, <HI>Is it expedient that Churches &s;hould enter into a Con&s;ociation, or Agreement, that Matters of more than ordinary Importance, &s;uch as the Gathering of a New Church, the Ordination, Depo&s;ition, or Tran&s;lation of a Pa&s;tor be done with common Con&s;ent?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> This is both Expedient and Nece&s;&s;ary. The <HI>Synod</HI> which Convened at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> Anno 1662. has &s;uffi|ciently cleared this Point. And although there was in
<PB N="168" REF="004275_0185_100433BBD620DB20">that <HI>Synod</HI> &s;ome di&s;&s;ent as to the <HI>Que&s;tion</HI> about the <HI>Subject of Bapti&s;m</HI> then di&s;cu&s;s'd; in the An&s;wer to the other <HI>Que&s;tion</HI> relating to the <HI>Con&s;ociation of Churches,</HI> there was an unanimous Concurrence. The De&s;ign of which is not (as has <HI>been</HI> well ob&s;erved by Dr. <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Medul. Theol.</HI> L. 1. C. 39. The&s;. 27.</NOTE> <HI>Ames</HI> and Mr. <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>De pol. eccle&s;.</HI> L. 3. C. 22.</NOTE> <HI>Parker</HI>) to infringe the Liberty of particular Churches, but from the Word of God to direct and &s;trengthen them in the regular Exerci&s;e thereof. The Rea&s;ons for it are &s;uch as the&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Churches of Chri&s;t &s;tand in a Si&s;terly Rela|tion each to other under Chri&s;t their Head, having the &s;ame <HI>Faith,</HI> and ought to have the &s;ame <HI>Order. Eph.</HI> 4.5. <HI>Col.</HI> 2.5. <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.16. This Union implies a &s;uitable Communion, and that they ought to have a mutual Care each of other. <HI>Cant.</HI> 8.8.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Scripture teacheth that in weighty Ca&s;es we &s;hould a&s;k Coun&s;el. 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 20.18. <HI>Prov.</HI> 3.5. and 15.22. and 24.6. Which General Rules concern <HI>Polities</HI> as well as particular Per&s;ons, and Churches as well as civil Societies.</P>
<P N="3">3. There are Scripture Examples to in&s;truct us in our Duty herein. We find, that when the Church in <HI>Antioch</HI> had a weighty Ca&s;e before them, they &s;ent to another Church for Coun&s;el, <HI>Act.</HI> 15.2. The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ought for the Concurrence, and <HI>Right Hand of Fellow&s;hip</HI> of other Apo&s;tles, <HI>Gal.</HI> 2.9. Ordinary Elders and Churches have no le&s;s need of each other to prevent their <HI>running in vain. Gal.</HI> 2.2.</P>
<P N="4">4. Such a Communion of Churches as that which we plead for, is no <HI>Innovation,</HI> but that which has ever been the Profe&s;&s;ion and Practice of tho&s;e that have been called <HI>Congregational.</HI> There is a Book which bears the Title of, <HI>An An&s;wer of the Elders of the &s;everal Churches in New-England to Thirty two Que&s;tions,</HI> Prin|ted in the Year 1643. Of which Book my Father
<PB N="169" REF="004275_0186_100433BFD6EC39A0"><HI>Mather</HI> was the &s;ole Author. And he wrote it in the Primitive Times of the&s;e Churches, (<HI>viz.</HI> in the Year 1639.) as him&s;elf a&s;&s;ured me. What he wrote was ap|proved of by other Elders, e&s;pecially by Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> unto whom he communicated it. Now in An&s;wer to Q. 18. <HI>p.</HI> 64. are the&s;e Words, <HI>The Con&s;ociation of Churches into Cla&s;&s;es and Synods, we hold to be lawful, and in &s;ome Ca&s;es nece&s;&s;ary: As namely, in Things that are not peculiar to one Church, but common to them all. And likewi&s;e, when a Church is not able to end any Mat|ter which concerns only them&s;elves, then they are to &s;eek for Coun&s;el and Advice from Neighbour Churches, as the Church at Antioch did &s;end unto the Church at Jeru&s;a|lem,</HI> Act. 15.2. <HI>The Ground and U&s;e of</HI> Cla&s;&s;es <HI>and</HI> Synods <HI>with the Limitations therein to be ob&s;erved, is &s;ummarily laid down by Dr.</HI> Ames, <HI>unto whom we do wholly con&s;ent in this Matter.</HI> This was, and is the Judgment of all that adhere to the <HI>Order of the Go&s;pel profe&s;&s;ed</HI> in the <HI>Churches of New-England.</HI> The World is much mi&s;taken in thinking that <HI>Congregational</HI> Chur|ches are <HI>Independent.</HI> The Name has indeed been fa&s;tned upon them by their Adver&s;aries; but our <HI>Plat|form of Di&s;cipline</HI> Chap. 2.

<P><HI>If it &s;hall be &s;aid, &s;urely they do not come up to the&s;e &s;ix Things mentioned.

<P N="5">5.

This has been objected (but injuriou&s;ly) as a Scandal attending <HI>the Congregational Church Di&s;cipline,</HI> and that therefore it is <HI>a Way not practicable.</HI> Indeed if we refu&s;e this part of <HI>Church Communion,</HI> the Objection would be
<PB N="172" REF="004275_0189_100433C5CB1E9E60">unan&s;werable. And who would be willing to be a Member of that Church, in which altho' he &s;hould be never &s;o much wrong'd, there would be no Relief for him upon Earth? There was once a Church in <HI>New-England,</HI> which having cen&s;ured one of their Members, he complain'd of the &s;uppo&s;ed Wrong done him, to Neighbour Elders, who thought he had receiv'd hard Mea&s;ure. The Pa&s;tor and major part of the Church were not willing the Ca&s;e &s;hould have a re-hearing before the Elders and Me&s;&s;engers of other Churches. Upon this, great Clamours were rai&s;ed, and Prejudices taken up again&s;t the Congregational Di&s;cipline. Mr. <HI>Cawdrey</HI> got this Story by the End, and in his <HI>Epi&s;tle to the Di&s;&s;enting Brethren,</HI> p. 10. He &s;ays that a Mi|ni&s;ter in <HI>N. E.</HI> writes over to <HI>England,</HI> that this injured Per&s;on would have <HI>no remedy until the Churebes in New-England were become Pre&s;byterians, and that if Independency does not break all the Churches in New-England excepting a few Semi-Pre&s;byterians, &s;ome are deceived.</HI> Who the Mini&s;ter was that wrote thus to <HI>England,</HI> Mr. <HI>Cawdrey</HI> tell us not. But it is a great Wrong to the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> and to the <HI>way Congregational,</HI> to repre&s;ent them, and all that are of <HI>that way,</HI> as being of &s;uch <HI>Independent and Unaccoun|table Principles,</HI> which they utterly di&s;claim. Dr. <HI>Owen</HI> in his <HI>Di&s;ciplinary Catechi&s;m,</HI> and e&s;pecially in the <HI>Ad|ditament thereunto,</HI> (which was written on Occa&s;ion of a har&s;h and ra&s;h Cen&s;ure in the <HI>Independent Church</HI> in <HI>Cambridge</HI> in <HI>England</HI>) has with great Evidence of Rea&s;on, refuted the maintainers of &s;uch an <HI>Indepen|dency.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. The Order a&s;&s;erted is (as has been truly ob&s;erved by the Learned <HI>Doctor</HI> la&s;t mention'd) confirm'd by the Practice of the fir&s;t Churches after the Apo&s;tles: For when the Church in <HI>Corinth</HI> had by an undue Exerci&s;e of Di&s;cipline depo&s;ed &s;ome of their Elders, the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> taking Cognizance of it, wrote to them, re|proving their ra&s;hne&s;s, and advis'd their Re&s;toration

And when the Church of <HI>Antioch</HI> was afterwards troubled with the Here&s;ies of their Pa&s;tor <HI>Samo&s;etanus,</HI> the Neighbouring Pa&s;tors came unto the Church, and join'd their Concurrence in his Depo&s;ition.

I fully clo&s;e with Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI>'s Di&s;cour&s;e, in his Preface before, <HI>Survey of Church-Di&s;cipline;</HI> That as the <HI>Prophetical</HI> and <HI>Prie&s;t|ly</HI> Office of CHRIST, was compleatly Vindicated in the Fir&s;t Times of <HI>Reformation,</HI> &s;o now the Great CAUSE and WORK of GOD'S <HI>Reforming People,</HI> is, to Clear the Rights of CHRIST'S <HI>Kingly</HI> Office, and in their <HI>Practice</HI> to &s;et up His <HI>Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>The KINGDOM of CHRIST, tho' it be now di&s;|ta&s;ted as a <HI>Fanatic Notion</HI> &mdash; by the Prophanene&s;s of Mens Hearts, which is ready to catch at any Occa&s;ion, to blemi&s;h it, and to ri&s;e up in Rage again&s;t the In|tere&s;t thereof: [P&s;al. II. 1, 3, 6.] Yet the True KINGDOM of CHRIST, (as the Scripture &s;tates it) is Glorious, and Divine, and that for which GOD will <HI>Overturn, Overturn, Overturn,</HI> until it be Erected in its Glory; and (&s;ay Men what they will) I will &s;till Pray, <HI>Thy Kingdom Come.</HI></P>
<P>The KINGDOM of CHRIST is, in general, no|thing el&s;e but <HI>The Flouri&s;hing of RELIGION,</HI> Or that whereby the WORD of CHRIST in the SCRIP|TURE, (which is called <HI>the Word of the Kingdom,</HI>) is fully &s;ubmitted to. In a Word, Then His <HI>Kingdom Comes</HI> in its Glory, when the Will of GOD is <HI>done on Earth as it is in Heaven:</HI> And &s;o far that <HI>Kingdom Comes,</HI> as this <HI>Will is done.</HI></P>
<P>The KINGDOM of CHRIST, or the Reception and Erecting thereof, is more <HI>Inward</HI> and <HI>Per&s;onal,</HI> in the <HI>Hearts</HI> and particular Conver&s;ations of Men; more <HI>Outward</HI> and <HI>Publick</HI> in <HI>Societies.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="004275_0219_1005477331531EF8">
The <HI>Former</HI> is, when any <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> are Converted, and help'd to Walk in New-Obedience; tho' they be never &s;o Few and Ob&s;cure. Thus CHRIST has always had a KINGDOM on Earth. And when this reaches unto <HI>Many,</HI> it cannot but become <HI>Vi&s;ible,</HI> in one Degree or other, and &s;o In&s;eparable from the Latter. Hence the <HI>General Conver&s;ion</HI> of <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> will be the Inlet of the Greate&s;t Glory of CHRIST'S <HI>Kingdom</HI> on Earth. Hence al&s;o, CHRIST has always had a <HI>King|dom</HI> in &s;ome Degree <HI>Vi&s;ible</HI> in &s;ome <HI>Societies</HI> of Men; tho' &s;ometimes very Thin, Low and Ob&s;cure, and kept under by Corruptions and Per&s;ecutions.</P>
<P>The Latter Erecting of CHRIST'S <HI>Kingdom</HI> in whole <HI>Societies,</HI> (whereby CHRIST is &s;een Ruling all in a Con&s;picuous and open, in a prevailing and peace|able manner,) was OUR DESIGN and is OUR IN|TEREST in this Country: tho' with Re&s;pect to the <HI>Inward</HI> and <HI>Invi&s;ible</HI> KINGDOM, as the Scope there|of. The Public &s;etting up of CHRIST'S <HI>Kingdom,</HI> and Enjoyment of tho&s;e Ordinances and Ways of His, which can only be enjoy'd in whole <HI>Societies,</HI> and that with <HI>Purity</HI> and <HI>Liberty,</HI> was OUR END in coming hither. And this al&s;o is CHRIST'S De&s;ign in the&s;e Latter Days; To &s;et up His <HI>Kingdom,</HI> in a Public and Openly prevailing manner, in all the Parts and Ways thereof.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Church,</HI> CHRIST'S <HI>Kingdom</HI> is clearly and gloriou&s;ly &s;et up, when ONLY and ALL His <HI>In&s;titu|tions,</HI> both in <HI>Wor&s;hip</HI> and <HI>Di&s;cipline</HI> are attended and ob&s;erved in their Purity and Power, according to Scrip|ture Pattern. [<HI>Mat.</HI> XXVIII. 18, 23.] THIS is the Great CAUSE and Intere&s;t of GOD'S People in this Country, and was the Great END of their Under|taking, and hath been the great Matter of this TESTI|MONY, in their <HI>Synodical Acts,</HI> and other Writings Publi&s;hed unto the World.</P>
<P>Hence our Great DUTY is to <HI>keep and &s;eek all the Commandments of GOD,</HI> [1 Chron. XXVIII. 8.] in
<PB N="203" REF="004275_0220_100547752E706998">that re&s;pect; that is, all the In&s;titutions and Ordinances of His Hou&s;e; To <HI>hold fa&s;t</HI> what we have attained, that is according to Scripture-Pattern therein, and to <HI>come up</HI> unto what we yet want or are defective in.</P>
<P>Hence al&s;o tho&s;e among us, that de&s;ire to &s;et up in this Country, any of the <HI>Ways of Men's Invention</HI> (as, <HI>Prelacy,</HI> &s;tinted <HI>Liturgies,</HI> Humane <HI>Ceremonies</HI> in Wor|&s;hip,) they will bid Defiance to the CAUSE and In|tere&s;t of CHRIST and of His People, in the&s;e Ends of the Earth; and will (I per&s;wade my &s;elf) but <HI>lay them&s;elves as Potters Ve&s;&s;els under the Iron Rod.</HI> For, CHRIST, who has taken this <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e uttermo&s;t parts of the Earth,</HI> will not Endure it. Let us <HI>Go forward</HI> to any of tho&s;e Things of CHRIST, that we are wanting in. But to <HI>Go backward</HI> unto tho&s;e Things which we know, and have openly Te&s;tified [<HI>Platform, c.</HI> 1. and <HI>c.</HI> 7. Sect. 6.] to be not of GOD, and which we departed from, will be &s;uch a <HI>Wickedne&s;s</HI> as the Lord's JEALOUSY will not bear withal.</P>
<P>Our Work is not only to depart from Mens <HI>Inven|tions,</HI> but to &s;et up All <HI>[ALL]</HI> GOD'S <HI>In&s;titutions</HI> in their Beauty and Power; that we may Exhibit a clear and complete Copy thereof before the World; and that we and ours may have that full Enjoyment of GOD, in all His Ordinances, that we came hither for.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Common Wealth CHRIST'S Kingdom</HI> is &s;et up, when all Things therein are &s;o ordered, (Laws and all Civil Admini&s;trations) as doth mo&s;t fitly and effectually tend to advance, promote, and maintain <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Reformation.</HI></P>
<P>Let us faithfully cleave to the WHOLE INTEREST and KINGDOM of CHRIST, and He can make us a <HI>Burden&s;ome Stone</HI> to all Oppo&s;ers, as He has done hi|therto, [<HI>Zech.</HI> XII. 3, 5. <HI>Dan.</HI> II. 44, 45. <HI>Matth.</HI> XXI. 44. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> LIV. 17.] and make Good to us, His Promi&s;e to <HI>Philadelphia;</HI> To keep our <HI>Door open,</HI> and to pre&s;erve us in the <HI>Hour of Temptation</HI> that is upon all the World.</P>

<HEAD>Number II. The CAUSE of GOD, and His People in NEW-ENGLAND; Stated in a SER|MON of the Memorable Mr. JOHN HIGGINSON, unto the General Court of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Co|lony,</HI> May 27. 1663.</HEAD>
<P>[On 1 <HI>King.</HI> VIII. 57, 58, 59.]</P>
<Q><P>THE CAUSE of GOD and His People among us, is, The <HI>Cau&s;e of RELIGION.</HI> &mdash; That every Thing in Doctrine, Wor&s;hip, and Di&s;cipline, be Conformed to and Regulated by, the Rule of the WORD.</P>
<P>When the Lord &s;tirred up the Spirits of &s;o many of His People to come over into this Wilderne&s;s, it was not for <HI>Worldly Wealth,</HI> or a better Livelihood for the Outward Man. The Generality of the People that came over, profe&s;s'd the contrary; Nor had we any Rational Grounds to expect &s;uch a Thing in &s;uch a Wilderne&s;s. Tho' GOD hath ble&s;&s;ed His poor People here, and there are that have increa&s;ed here, from &s;mall Beginnings to great E&s;tates; That the Lord may call this whole Generation to witne&s;s. &mdash; <HI>O Generation &s;ee!</HI> Look upon your Towns and Fields, Look upon your Habitations and Shops, and Ships, and behold your Numerous Po&s;terity, and Great Increa&s;e in the Ble&s;&s;ings of the Land and Sea; <HI>Have I been a Wilderne&s;s unto you?</HI> We mu&s;t needs an&s;wer, <HI>No, Lord, Thou ha&s;t been a Gracious GOD, and Exceeding Good unto thy Servants, even in the&s;e Earthly Ble&s;&s;ings; we live in a more Plentiful and
<PB N="205" REF="004275_0222_1005472FE2DDC800">Comfortable manner than ever we did expect.</HI> But the&s;e are but Additions; they are but Additional Mercies; It was Another and Better Thing, that we <HI>followed the Lord into the Wilderne&s;s</HI> for. This is never to be forgotten, That <HI>New-England</HI> is Originally a <HI>Planta|tion of Religion.</HI> And if any Man among&s;t us, make <HI>Religion</HI> as <HI>Twelve,</HI> and the <HI>World</HI> as <HI>Thirteen,</HI> Let &s;uch an One know, he hath neither the Spirit of a <HI>True New-England Man,</HI> nor yet of a <HI>Sincere Chri&s;|tian.</HI></P>
<P>And the <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> is not <HI>Separation</HI> from any thing Good in other Churches. The End of our Coming hither was a <HI>Reformaiion</HI> only of what was <HI>Ami&s;s</HI> or <HI>Defective</HI> in the Churches we came from. We di&s;tin|gui&s;h between the <HI>Corruptions</HI> and <HI>Di&s;orders</HI> of Chur|ches, and the <HI>Churches</HI> them&s;elves. So much for the <HI>Negative.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Now for the <HI>Affirmative.</HI> 'If my weakne&s;s was able to &s;hew, what the <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> of GOD and His Peo|ple in <HI>New-England</HI> is, according to its <HI>Divine Ori|ginal</HI> and <HI>Native Beauty,</HI> it would dazzle the Eyes of Angels, daunt the Hearts of Devils, ravi&s;h and chain fa&s;t the Affections of all the Saints.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, This was and is our CAUSE, that CHRIST alone might be acknowledged by us, as the only <HI>Head, Lord,</HI> and <HI>Lawgiver</HI> in His Church; That His <HI>Written Word</HI> might be acknowledged as the <HI>Only Rule;</HI> That Only and All His <HI>In&s;titutions</HI> might be ob&s;erved, and Enjoyed by us, and that with Purity and Liberty, with Peace and Power.</P>
<P>Secondly, I conceive our CAUSE is not barely a <HI>Reformation,</HI> but a PROGRESS in <HI>Reformation;</HI> To <HI>go on unto Perfection.</HI> A conceit of having already attain'd a <HI>Perfect Reformation,</HI> &s;hould be far from us. &mdash; Our Fathers <HI>fled into this Wilderne&s;s from the face</HI> of a <HI>Lording Epi&s;copacy,</HI> and <HI>Humane Injunctions</HI> in the Wor&s;hip of GOD. Now, if any of us their Chil|dren &s;hould yield unto, or be In&s;trumental to &s;et up
<PB N="206" REF="004275_0223_10054778B1443690">in this Country, any of the Ways of Men's Invention, &s;uch as <HI>Prelacy,</HI> impo&s;ed <HI>Liturgies,</HI> Humane <HI>Cere|monies</HI> in the Wor&s;hip of GOD, or to admit <HI>Ignorant</HI> and <HI>Scandalous</HI> Per&s;ons to the <HI>Lord's Table;</HI> This would be a <HI>Back&s;liding indeed!</HI> It would be a Back|&s;liding to the Things which we and our Fathers have departed from, and have openly te&s;tified again&s;t, to be not of GOD.</P>
<P>Thirdly, The <HI>Union of Reformers</HI> belongs unto this CAUSE; For there is not any one Duty more pre&s;s'd by our Saviour CHRIST and His Apo&s;tles, than this of an holy and clo&s;e Union among tho&s;e that profe&s;s His Name. The be&s;t of Men may err; and there being divers Mea&s;ures of Light and Grace, there cannot but be <HI>Different Apprehen&s;ions</HI> in &s;ome Things: And therefore, where there is not &s;o full an Agreement as is to be de&s;ired, it is our Duty to <HI>forbear one another in Love,</HI> Endeavouring to <HI>keep the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace.</HI></P>
<P>This is the Chief <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> of NEW-ENGLAND; the Matter of greate&s;t Importance in it&s;elf, and of greate&s;t Concernment unto us. Whatever may be &s;aid of our <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> in other re&s;pects, yet we may be &s;ure of This, that here lies our <HI>pradominant Intere&s;t</HI> and CAUSE; and the Great END for which we came into this Wilderne&s;s, and continue in it.</P>

<HEAD>Number IV. The TESTIMONY Fini&s;hed, By Dr. INCREASE MATHER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Now the&s;e be the La&s;t Words</HI> &mdash;</P>
<P>HAVING reviewed the Harmonious TESTIMO|NY of tho&s;e <HI>Three Worthies</HI> in our <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> our Memorable MITCHEL, our Venerable HIGGIN|SON, and our Honourable STOUGHTON, unto the CAUSE of GOD in the Churches of NEW-EN|GLAND, and the Great END of the&s;e Plantations, I do now with my DYING HAND Sign my Con|currence thereunto. I am now in the <HI>Eighty Fourth</HI> Year of my Age, and under a Feeblene&s;s in the <HI>Valley of the &s;hadow of Death,</HI> wherein the LORD is yet <HI>a Light unto me,</HI> and makes it but a <HI>Shadow of Death;</HI> and I am every Hour waiting and longing for my <HI>Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion</HI> to a Better World. In the&s;e very &s;ingular Circum&s;tances, I am willing to add my TESTIMONY concurrent with the foregoing, and I do <HI>Declare,</HI> That the Principal DESIGN upon which the&s;e Colonies were at fir&s;t Planted, was to <HI>Profe&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Practice</HI> and <HI>Enjoy,</HI> with undi&s;turb'd Liberty, the Holy RELIGION of GOD our SAVIOUR, Exhibited in the SACRED SCRIPTURES, and Reformed and Re&s;cued from the <HI>Inventions</HI> and <HI>Abu&s;es,</HI> which the <HI>Man of Sin</HI> has intro|duced; And, more particularly, To &s;et up CHUR|CHES [Even of the <HI>Aboriginal Natives,</HI> as well as of <HI>Engli&s;h Chri&s;tians</HI>] for our Lord JESUS CHRIST, that &s;hall keep them&s;elves <HI>Loyal</HI> to Him, their Glorious KING, in His Word, giving <HI>Law</HI> unto them; and

<P>Indeed, I cannot but go away Rejoicing in it, That the Means, which are indefatigably u&s;ed, for the draw|ing of <HI>unwary People</HI> into the <HI>Things that will not profit</HI> them, have had &s;o little Succe&s;s; and that the Body of the <HI>Sober People</HI> throughout the Country, (&s;o far as I under&s;tand) generally continue to di&s;cover &s;uch a con&s;pi|cuous Aver&s;ion to the Things, from the <HI>Face whereof</HI> their Fathers <HI>&s;led into the Wilderne&s;s:</HI> tho' at the &s;ame time, a too general Decay of that Real and Vital God|line&s;s, which is to be the <HI>main Intention</HI> of all, is greatly to be bewailed. But there may be Danger of <HI>Another Generation ari&s;ing,</HI> which will not <HI>know the Lord,</HI> nor the <HI>Works</HI> done <HI>by Him,</HI> and for Him, among His Peo|ple here.</P>
<P>And therefore from the Suburbs of that Glorious World, into which I am now Entring, I earne&s;tly Te&s;tify unto the <HI>Ri&s;ing Generation,</HI> That if they &s;infully For&s;ake the GOD, and the Hope, and the Religious Ways of their pious An|ce&s;tors, the Glorious LORD will &s;everely puni&s;h their <HI>Apo&s;tacy,</HI> and be <HI>Terrible from His Holy Places</HI> unto them.</P>
<P>Now, <HI>The Lord our GOD be with you, as He was with your Fathers; Let Him not leave you, nor for&s;ake you.</HI> LORD, <HI>Let thy Work appear unto thy Servants, and thy Glory unto their Children!</HI></P>
