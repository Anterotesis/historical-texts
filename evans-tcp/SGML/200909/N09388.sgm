<P>THE chief occa&s;ion of the en&s;uing di&s;|cour&s;e is this: About four years ago, on a view of the prevailing di&s;po&s;ition in multitudes, either to pry into futuri|ties, to the neglect of pre&s;ent duty, or to contend about religion, in&s;tead of regarding the life and practice of it, while the vanities of time carried the world before them, I was moved to publi&s;h a di&s;cour&s;e from <HI>James</HI> ii. 22. with this title, <HI>True Faith will produce good Works.</HI> And through the whole endeavoured to handle the glorious truths of the go&s;pel in a practical way; and had as little expectation of being publicly attacked therefor as for any thing I ever wrote: And I was not alone in this thought, for a worthy mini&s;ter in <HI>Great-Britain</HI> &s;ays, in a letter, <Q>Your &s;ermon on the Fruits of Faith is well adapted to &s;ilence gain|&s;ayers.</Q> Yet how often are we di&s;appointed in this evil world!</P>

Mr. <HI>Daniel Martin,</HI> Elder of a Bapti&s;t Church in <HI>Rehoboth,</HI> publi&s;hed a piece la&s;t fall, intituled, <HI>Some Meditations on the plain Te&s;timony of the ho|ly Scriptures, relating to the</HI> elect <HI>or</HI> cho&s;en of God, &amp;c. wherein, after in&s;erting as a motto our Saviour's caution to take heed how and who we hear, he begins thus: <Q>Having received the foregoing caution and in&s;truction from the mo&s;t wonderful Coun&s;ellor that ever &s;poke on earth. I have made the following ob&s;ervations on &s;e|veral points of doctrine delivered by Mr. <HI>I&s;aac B&mdash;s,</HI> in his book intituled, <HI>True Faith will produce good Works,</HI> wherein he hath made ma|ny worthy ob&s;ervations, and given divers good in&s;tructions; but to my &s;orrow he hath advanc|ed &s;everal points of doctrine, which appear to me to be in oppo&s;ition to the &s;en&s;e and pure meaning of the holy &s;criptures.</Q> And he goes on to bend all his force through his whole per|formance again&s;t the peculiar doctrines of &s;ove|reign grace.</P>
<P>Several rea&s;ons were &s;ugge&s;ted, in my own mind and by others, again&s;t making any reply to this piece at all: As that it is &s;o plainly erroneous, that it was not likely to do much hurt; that there is no end of controver&s;y; and it is peculiarly di&s;|agreeable for one Bapti&s;t to contend with another, who have &s;o many others again&s;t them on every &s;ide. But in an&s;wer to this, it appears, that as plain as the&s;e errors are, yet many are carried away with them; and though contention is di&s;agreeable, yet if we can &s;ee the faith once delivered to the &s;aints betrayed, and hold our peace, how &s;hall we an&s;wer it to him who has required us to contend
<PB N="7" REF="011971_0005_0F92A44270A96D90"><HI>earne&s;tly</HI> therefor? And will not a ju&s;t view of the la&s;t objection turn its weight the other way? For an engine which has been much u&s;ed, both in the pa&s;t and pre&s;ent age, to prejudice people again&s;t the Bapti&s;ts, has been to repre&s;ent them as un&s;ound in go&s;pel doctrine; and now when an aged Elder of that denomination has repre&s;ented to the world, that to hold, "That faith is not of man," carries in it that <Q>He that is ju&s;tified by faith, is ju&s;tified becau&s;e God hath given it to him; and he that believeth not is damned, becau&s;e God hath not given him faith;</Q> p. 15. if we let &s;uch reproach|es again&s;t &s;overeign grace pa&s;s unan&s;wered, be|cau&s;e in our denomination, what a handle would others make of it, to repre&s;ent us all either as corrupt in principle, or el&s;e more after party than truth? Nay, if tho&s;e who met their <HI>enemies</HI> ox or a&s;s going a&s;tray, and did not bring it back again, broke a command of God<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Exod.</HI> xxiii. 4.</NOTE>; how can we an&s;wer it to him, if we &s;ee our <HI>friends</HI> and fellow mortals going in a way that we are fully convinced leads to de&s;truction, and not attempt, as we have op|portunity, to &s;hew them their danger? <HI>Paul</HI>'s ear|ne&s;t de&s;ire for the &s;alvation of his brethren and kinsfolk, moved him to take pains to convince them, that, though they followed after the law of righteou&s;ne&s;s, yet that they did quite mi&s;s their way, becau&s;e they &s;ought it <HI>not by faith, but as it were by the deeds of the law. Rom.</HI> ix. 22. And as it appears to me that Mr. <HI>M&mdash;n</HI> has mi&s;&s;ed the right way in the &s;ame re&s;pect, I think it a du|ty to attempt in a brief and plain manner to &s;hew him wherein he has done &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="011971_0006_0F92A443376F19E0">
The grand point which he objects again&s;t in my book, is the manner of my holding <HI>election:</HI> He profe&s;&s;eth to hold it; but thinks I hold it in a wrong way. I had ob&s;erved from <HI>Eph.</HI> i. 3&mdash;7. that <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays, <HI>He hath cho&s;en us, that we &s;hould be holy;</HI> but the modern notions are, that he choo&s;eth us becau&s;e we <HI>are holy,</HI> making that to be the <HI>cau&s;e,</HI> which <HI>Paul</HI> viewed to be the <HI>effect:</HI> All the contro|ver&s;y turns upon this point, whether the good plea|&s;ure of God's will, or our free will, be the cau&s;e of our holine&s;s and happine&s;s. Mr. <HI>M&mdash;n</HI> mentions this, and an&s;wers, that <HI>both</HI> are the cau&s;e thereof, p. 6. To prove which, he cites many declarations of God's good will, and then &s;ays; <Q>Since it is the good will of God that all men &s;hould be &s;aved and come to the knowledge of the truth, what doth hinder, or indeed what can hinder or prevent, but the want of man's good will?</Q> p. 7. Ay &s;ure enough, what el&s;e can hinder? But &s;ince that is <HI>wanting,</HI> how can it be any cau&s;e of our &s;alvation? <HI>Solomon</HI> fays, That which is <HI>wanting</HI> cannot be numbered: Yet behold! here is one wi&s;er than <HI>Solomon!</HI> For he can reckon that which is <HI>wanting</HI> for a principal part of the capital &s;um! Perhaps it will be &s;aid, if it is wanting in one, it may not in another. This I &s;uppo&s;e is the thing aimed at, for he &s;ays, <Q>By free will I un|der&s;tand good will; when a man's will is to do the will of God.</Q> p. 7. And again, <Q>We may a&s;&s;ure our&s;elves, that God hath not hid the light of the go&s;pel from any man or people, who de&s;ire and &s;eek after the knowledge of God.</Q> p. 13. Who pretends that he does? I was &s;o far from doing of it, that in an&s;wer to an
<PB N="9" REF="011971_0007_0F92A44406AC6B78">objection, p. 82. I. ob&s;erved, that "We may be heartily willing to do many outward actions, which yet we cannot do, and &s;o are excu&s;ed from blame in our not doing them; but the cau&s;e why &s;ouls cannot believe the record which God has given of his Son, and love and obey him with all their hearts, is becau&s;e they <HI>love darkne&s;s rather than light;</HI> yea, <HI>hate the light,</HI> becau&s;e the <HI>carnal mind is enmity again&s;t God." John</HI> iii. 19, 20. <HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 7. And if our advocate for free will and good works read this and much more to the &s;ame purpo&s;e in my book, before he wrote again&s;t it, where are his good works, while he mi&s;repre&s;ents my &s;entiments? And if he did not read it, where is his regard to equity, to condemn a man without a hearing?</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>M&mdash;n</HI> has told us, that by free will he under&s;tands a will to do the will of God; but he has not informed us who the people are, or where they live, that naturally have &s;uch a will: He is not &s;o fair in this re&s;pect, as <HI>Robert Barclay</HI> was about <HI>perfection;</HI> for though he laboured much to prove that &s;uch a &s;tate was attainable in this life, yet he &s;ays, <Q>With re&s;pect to my&s;elf, I &s;peak mo|de&s;tly, becau&s;e I ingeniou&s;ly confe&s;s that I have not yet attained it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By the way I would here ob&s;erve, that as in my late <HI>Plea for Liberty of Con&s;cience,</HI> I happened to mention it as a Quaker notion, that when a per&s;on has the &s;pirit with him, he is then per&s;ect; I would now retract that &s;entence; for I am informed by a principal leader among them, that I mi&s;took their &s;enti|ments; and I would always watch again&s;t mi&s;repre&s;enting any people, though I differ ever &s;o much from them. He informs me that they hold &s;anctification to be a progre&s;&s;ive work, and that a per&s;on may be under powerful influences of the &s;pirit, and yet have remaining corruptions, though they &s;uppo&s;e that a perfect victory over them is attainable in this life. Now as I willingly retract my mi&s;take of their &s;entiments, &s;o I think it but a friendly part to let them know, that for friend <HI>Barclay,</HI> in p. 8. of his Apology, to repre&s;ent that <Q>Tho&s;e who plead for ju&s;tification wholly by the imputation of a righteou&s;ne&s;s without them, deny the nece&s;&s;ity of being cloathed with an inward righteou&s;ne&s;s,</Q> is not ju&s;t; for no men upon earth hold &s;tronger to the nece&s;&s;ity of regeneration and inward &s;anc|tification, than tho&s;e who tru&s;t alone on Chri&s;t's imputed righ|teou&s;ne&s;s for their ju&s;tification before God.</NOTE>.</Q> So here I believe every
<PB N="10" REF="011971_0008_0F92A446881B64C8">one of <HI>Adam</HI>'s children, who are brought to a true &s;ight of their ca&s;e, will concur with the Apo&s;tle's confe&s;&s;ion, that <HI>all</HI> have &s;inned and come &s;hort of the glory of God; and that <HI>all</HI> go on, either &s;e|cretly or openly, to &s;erve divers lu&s;ts and plea|&s;ures, till the kindne&s;s and love of God our Sa|viour appears, <HI>not by works of righteou&s;ne&s;s which we have done, but according to his mercy,</HI> to &s;ave us, by the <HI>wa&s;hing of regeneration, and renewing of the Ho|ly Gho&s;t, Rom.</HI> iii. 23. <HI>Tit.</HI> iii. 3&mdash;5. Our author's notion that both God's will and ours are the cau&s;e of our &s;alvation, runs him into the following ab|&s;urdities.</P>
<P N="1">I. To exclude all tho&s;e divine te&s;timonies which prove man's univer&s;al depravity: That both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> are <HI>all</HI> under &s;in, and <HI>none</HI> righteous, no <HI>not one;</HI> are <HI>all</HI> gone out of the way, and <HI>none</HI> that doth good, no <HI>not one;</HI> that we are <HI>by nature</HI> children of wrath, <HI>even as others;</HI> that the &s;crip|ture hath included <HI>all</HI> under &s;in, <HI>Rom.</HI> iii. 9&mdash;19. <HI>Eph.</HI> ii. 3. <HI>Gal.</HI> iii. 22. I &s;ay his notion excludes all &s;uch te&s;timonies of truth, of which the bible is full, even &s;o far, that though his book is filled with texts which he imagines will prove univer&s;al redemption, yet I think he never takes notice of
<PB N="11" REF="011971_0009_0F92A44716330390">one that proves our univer&s;al depravity, notwith|&s;tanding he talks &s;o much of keeping clo&s;e to &s;cripture.</P>
<P N="2">II. As the nature of his &s;cheme is the &s;ame of that which in&s;nared the <HI>Galatians,</HI> &s;o it is attended with the &s;ame con&s;equence which the Apo&s;tle mentions to them: It would <HI>fru&s;trate</HI> the grace of God, and make Chri&s;t to <HI>die in vain, Gal.</HI> ii. 21. For if men have a will to do the will of God, they had no need of a Saviour to die for them, and if they have it not, they are like to peri&s;h, notwith|&s;tanding what he has done; for Mr. <HI>M&mdash;n</HI> &s;ays, <Q>It &s;eems by our Lord's parable, <HI>Luke</HI> xiv. 16&mdash;20. that there was nothing wanting on the part of him that made the &s;upper, but on the part of them that were bidden; their good will was lacking; their will and affections were on earthly things.</Q> p. 7. Therefore by his &s;cheme, unle&s;s our Lord could find &s;ome of the children of men who had not their will and affections on earth|ly things, his great &s;upper will be lo&s;t: Nay it mu&s;t unavoidably be &s;o; for if any could be found with &s;uch a good will as our author de&s;cribes, the Saviour could have no right to call them to this &s;upper, becau&s;e he came not to call the righteous, but &s;inners to repentance, <HI>Luke</HI> v. 32. That turn which way you will, this notion of free will <HI>fru&s;|trates</HI> the grace of God, and would make Chri&s;t to <HI>die in vain.</HI> Mr. <HI>M&mdash;n</HI> &s;ays, <Q>They did not improve the power he had given them.</Q> I know they did not improve it right, for they improved it to excu&s;e them&s;elves from coming, and to pur|&s;ue their own ways. Again he a&s;&s;erts, that <Q>Faith is a work which God requireth of man, and
<PB N="12" REF="011971_0010_0F92A447B0C64460">what our Lord taught the people to labour in.</Q> p. 14. And to prove it refers us to <HI>John</HI> vi. 27&mdash;29. Though in this he di&s;covers a darker notion about faith than the <HI>Jews</HI> did, for it appears that they knew that faith is giving credit to another, and not a work of our own; therefore in the next words they a&s;k for a &s;ign, that they might &s;ee and believe, and they plainly intimate, that though he had fed five thou&s;and, yet <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> had done much more, even fed &s;ix hundred thou&s;and of their fathers in the wilderne&s;s, &s;o that they were not inclined to leave <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> for <HI>Je&s;us;</HI> and though he a&s;&s;ured them that it was not <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> who gave that bread, and that the Father had now given the true bread from heaven, yet their di&s;po&s;ition and conduct di&s;cover|ed plainly, that it mu&s;t be the <HI>work of God</HI> to make any of them believe it. Mr. <HI>M&mdash;n</HI> is &s;o far from allowing this point, that he ventures to de|clare, that <Q>The unbeliever is not made a be|liever by the mighty power of God working in him, but by hearing and receiving the word.</Q> p. 30. And &s;o becau&s;e the word is the in&s;trument of faith, he denies that God by his power is the <HI>author</HI> of it; and holds it to be "of man." p. 14. Hence,</P>
<P N="3">III. His plan would make the will of the Cre|ator <HI>dependent</HI> on the will of the creature; for he labours much to prove that full provi&s;ion is made for the &s;alvation of all men, while he owns that many mi&s;s of it, becau&s;e their good will is wanting, yet denies the exertion of divine power to work faith in any; the certain con&s;equence of which is, that it <HI>depends</HI> upon man's will whether God &s;hall ever have his good will in the &s;alvation of one &s;oul
<PB N="13" REF="011971_0011_0F92A44897F71220">or not! This con&s;equence is &s;o unan&s;werable, that it &s;eems our author dare not meddle with it; for I had mentioned it in a quotation from one of our Bapti&s;t Elders in <HI>Carolina,</HI> at the foot of my 56th page; yet though he quotes a pa&s;&s;age out of the middle of that page, he never &s;ays a word upon this glaring ab&s;urdity which attends his doctrine. For the reader's &s;atisfaction, I will give him the pa&s;|&s;age. It is this: <Q><HI>Conditional election</HI> &s;ets up an <HI>inferior</HI> cau&s;e above a <HI>&s;uperior;</HI> making election and &s;alvation no more than a <HI>may be,</HI> in&s;tead of a <HI>&s;hall be.</HI> It repre&s;ents the Almighty as ever fluctuating in his councils, taking up with new con&s;ultations <HI>dependent</HI> on the fickle will of man, and the uncertain acts that flow therefrom; by which method he is brought in &s;aying, O! I will if they will, and O! that they may will to believe, become holy, diligently and per&s;ever|ingly improving their &s;tock of free will abilities, that they may be &s;aved; neverthele&s;s NOT MY WILL, but THEIR WILL be done<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>I&s;aac Chanler</HI>'s Doctrines of Grace, printed at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> 1744, p. 208.</NOTE>!</Q> Now &s;ince this lay directly in Mr. <HI>M&mdash;n</HI>'s way, what rea|&s;on can be given for his avoiding any mention of it, but becau&s;e he could not an&s;wer it? I confe&s;s it is beyond my weak capacity to conceive how it can be fairly an&s;wered, and if others can, it would certainly be much more to the purpo&s;e to do it, than what they on that &s;ide generally dwell up|on. The &s;um of all our author's meditations is, he imagines that to hold the good plea&s;ure of God's will to be the &s;ole cau&s;e of our &s;alvation, and that faith is his gift, and wrought in the &s;oul
<PB N="14" REF="011971_0012_0F92A44C1C8A0F90">by his power, would carry this dreadful con&s;e|quence in it, <Q>That men cannot be judged and rewarded according to their works, but accord|ing as he hath given, or neglected to give.</Q> And he &s;eems as much affrighted at this imagination as ever a timorous per&s;on was at a black &s;tump in the night: He has it over and over from one end of his pamphlet to the other, and upon every mention of it, he turns away to a number of &s;crip|tures, which prove that God is both ju&s;t and mer|ciful, which we hold as fully as he does; al&s;o upon every view of my pleas for God's &s;overeign|ty and power, that frightful image ri&s;es in view, again, which makes &s;uch powerful impre&s;&s;ions up|on him, that he &s;eems not to know &s;cripture when he runs again&s;t it. For in&s;tance, I had ob&s;erved, p. 33. that &s;aving faith is a receiving with all the heart the witne&s;s and te&s;timony that God has giv|en of eternal life in his Son, and he who believeth not hath made him a liar. I&s;t <HI>John,</HI> v. 9&mdash;12. the evidence of which truth &s;hines &s;o clear as to leave all without excu&s;e, who do not believe with all their hearts; while every &s;oul that is made willing by divine power to receive his te&s;timony, and &s;et to his &s;eal that God is true, knows that this <HI>faith is not of him&s;elf,</HI> it is the <HI>gift of God.</HI> I thus marked the&s;e la&s;t words as &s;cripture, and in the margin referred to the text, <HI>Eph.</HI> ii. 8. yet Mr. <HI>M&mdash;n,</HI> after citing this pa&s;&s;age, &s;ays, <Q>Is it right to &s;ay, becau&s;e faith is the gift of God, that therefore it is not of man?</Q> And after bringing many texts to try to prove that this is not true, he &s;ays, <Q>Now let us con&s;ider a little of the con&s;equence of this <HI>vain notion,</HI> that faith is <HI>not
<PB N="15" REF="011971_0013_0F92A44C697A5CC8">of man.</HI></Q> P. 14, 15. And &s;o recurs to his frightful imagination again, without being &s;en&s;i|ble that he is not here contending with <HI>I. B.</HI> but with divine revelation. And I mu&s;t confe&s;s that tho&s;e who hold to his doctrine of free will, would be more con&s;i&s;tent to own them&s;elves <HI>Dei&s;ts,</HI> than to act as they now do; for Dr. <HI>Young,</HI> the mo&s;t open Dei&s;t that I have heard of in this coun|try, publi&s;hed a piece in his own defence, in the <HI>Bo&s;ton Evening-Po&s;t,</HI> the 27th of la&s;t <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> where|in he declares, he has as great a veneration for ma|ny glorious things in the old and new-te&s;tament as any Chri&s;tian in this country; but &s;ays, there are &s;ome things in the &s;criptures that he does not un|der&s;tand. And what are they? Why &s;ays he, <Q>Such as how God can be &s;aid to prede&s;tinate one to everla&s;ting life, and leave another to inevi|table and eternal perdition, and yet <HI>of a truth,</HI> be no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons.</Q> This he thinks to be incon&s;i&s;tent, and therefore rejects tho&s;e parts of &s;cripture that teach it: Mr. <HI>M&mdash;n</HI> profe&s;&s;es to hold all the &s;cripture, and yet the center of all his difficulty with me, is exactly the &s;ame that the De|i&s;t has again&s;t the bible, becau&s;e it teaches that doctrine. And the bottom of the matter with both is, becau&s;e they think they <HI>de&s;erve</HI> &s;omething bet|ter than to be left to peri&s;h in their &s;ins: For if that were not the ca&s;e, any per&s;on of common &s;en&s;e can ea&s;ily &s;ee the right the <HI>hou&s;holder</HI> had to <HI>give</HI> to &s;ome what they did not de&s;erve, while he did not fail to let every one have their due, and can &s;ee the iniquity of tho&s;e who <HI>murmured</HI> at the <HI>good man</HI> for &s;o doing.

But let the matter be well examined: We both profe&s;s that full provi&s;ion is made in the go&s;pel for the &s;alvation of &s;inners, and I believe that God
<PB N="21" REF="011971_0019_0F92A455AF46EBA8">will <HI>make his people willing</HI> in the day of <HI>his power,</HI> to &s;erve him in the <HI>beauty of holine&s;s;</HI> that all who are given by the Father to the Son, <HI>&s;hall come to him;</HI> and that <HI>no man can come except the Father draw him,</HI> which drawing is by the <HI>teaching</HI> and al|mighty influence of the Holy Gho&s;t, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> cx. 3. <HI>John</HI> vi. 37, 44, 45, 63. and xvi. 8.

Therefore as long as &s;ouls conceit they have or can work up &s;uch a good will, they go on with &s;elf-righteous hopes; but when they find that they have not &s;uch a free will power, and cannot work it up, they mu&s;t &s;ink in de&s;pair, notwith&s;tanding the help this &s;cheme can afford them. He calls it a <HI>bold a&s;&s;ertion</HI> for me to &s;ay, faith is wrought in the &s;oul by the exceeding greatne&s;s of divine power; and &s;ays, for this I quote but one text, viz. <HI>Eph.</HI> i. 19. p. 27. which is not true, for in the &s;ame &s;entence (p. 31 of my book) I quote another which calls Je&s;us the <HI>author</HI> and <HI>fini&s;her of faith, Heb.</HI> xii. 2. And though he imagines that the power &s;poken of in <HI>Eph.</HI> i. 19. is only what is exerted to a&s;&s;i&s;t the believer in do|ing wonders, and not a <Q>Power which none can hinder, working &s;aith in them who have not be|lieved," p. 27, and pre&s;umes to &s;ay, "The un|believer is not made a believer by the mighty power of God working in him,</Q> p. 30.

And &s;ince Mr. <HI>M&mdash;n</HI> denies that the power &s;poken of in <HI>Eph.</HI> i. 19. which rai&s;ed Chri&s;t from the dead, is the power that fir&s;t makes a &s;inner a believer, I would de&s;ire him to read on to the next chapter, where truth &s;ays, <HI>When we were dead in &s;ins God bath quickened us together with Chri&s;t:&mdash;By grace are ye &s;aved, through faith; and that</HI> NOT OF <HI>your&s;elves: It is the gift of God; not of works, le&s;t any man &s;hould boa&s;t, for we are his workman&s;hip,</HI> CREATED <HI>in Chri&s;t Je&s;us unto good works.</HI> And if he will dare to &s;ay, that <HI>creating</HI> power, and the power that <HI>quickens the dead,</HI> is not the power that <Q>none can hinder,</Q> I &s;hall not think it worth while for any man to rea&s;on farther with him; but hoping that he will not re&s;i&s;t the light to &s;uch a degree, I would reque&s;t him to review the ab&s;urdity of his notion, that a greater power is di&s;played to a&s;&s;i&s;t the believer than to convert a &s;inner; that is, that a greater power is exerted to help Chri&s;t's friends, than to conquer his enemies! read <HI>P&s;al.</HI> xlv. 1&mdash;7. compared with <HI>Heb.</HI> i. 8, 9.</P>
<P>Thus I have &s;hewn, that the notion of per&s;ons being elected becau&s;e of their fore&s;een faith and obedience, and that God has made full provi&s;ion for all, yet does not exert his power to bring any to embrace it, but leaves that to the creatures will, excludes all the abundant te&s;timony that truth has given to man's univer&s;al depravity, would fru&s;trate the grace of God, and make Chri&s;t to die in vain; would make the will of the Creator dependent on that of the creature, and rob God of his e&s;&s;ential

<P>Mr. <HI>M&mdash;n,</HI> in order to make out that though faith is the gift of God, yet that it is <HI>of man,</HI> &s;ays, <Q>Our temporal food and raiment are the gifts of God, are they therefore not of men? Hath not God ordained that man &s;hould get bread by the &s;weat of his face? <HI>Gen.</HI> iii. 19&mdash;23. And when he fed his people <HI>I&s;rael</HI> with bread from heaven, and quails in the wilderne&s;s, they had it together, and dre&s;t, and did not eat thereof without their labour; &s;o then faith being the gift of God, doth not hinder its being the work and labour of men,</Q> p. 14. Upon which I would remark,</P>
<P N="1">1. That here is no di&s;tinction made betwixt na|tural and &s;piritual actions, between which there is as great a difference as there is between &s;oul and body. We all grant that men have a natural power to do rational actions, but the que&s;tion is, whether any have ability to perform any &s;piritual or holy action, before they are regenerated by the
<PB N="24" REF="011971_0022_0F92A4577A9D62E8">holy &s;pirit or not?&mdash;2. It is the divine appoint|ment that our temporal food and raiment &s;hould be rai&s;ed out of the earth by our labour, but to hold &s;alvation upon &s;uch a footing, would make it of <HI>works</HI> and not of <HI>grace,</HI> contrary to the whole go&s;pel.&mdash;3. We allow that the manna that was rained round the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> tents, was a type of the heavenly food which is brought near to our &s;ouls in the go&s;pel, and as they were to receive and eat of it freely, &s;o the go&s;pel calls us to a fea&s;t where <HI>all things are now ready;</HI> but how ridiculous would a me&s;&s;enger appear, that &s;hould come and call the poor and needy to a <HI>free</HI> entertainment, upon condition they will fir&s;t <HI>work hard for it!</HI> None ex|pect that per&s;ons will enjoy the benefit of food, though ever &s;o choice and free, if they do not re|ceive it; but who ever thought that eating food was working for it, or performing a condition to obtain it? However, as coming and eating imply local motion and bodily exerci&s;e, we are in danger of having our minds &s;omewhat darkened by this &s;imilitude, if we do not correct it by others; therefore our Lord, in his di&s;cour&s;e to <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> compares believing to <HI>I&s;rael</HI>'s looking to the brazen &s;erpent, which was not a local motion nor long ex|erci&s;e; but as quick as &s;ight; neither had they any thing to recommend them, for they were poi&s;oned in a deadly manner, and that as the fruit of their &s;in; but they were called to look off from them|&s;elves to the remedy which God had freely pro|vided, and as many as did &s;o received immediate healing. So do all tho&s;e who behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the &s;in of the world. The very notion of faith carries us off from our&s;elves,
<PB N="25" REF="011971_0023_0F92A458330D5DD0">for it is admitting the te&s;timony of another, and not any work of ours; our character has no con|cern in the affair, as whether we are poor or rich, worthy or unworthy, for it depends entirely upon the evidence that we have of the credibility of the &s;peaker: And though we often &s;trive again&s;t, or try to avoid the light, becau&s;e our deeds are evil, yet when our &s;ouls are brought to receive divine truth, it is no more of our work than it is to &s;ee and enjoy the light when the &s;un &s;hines, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> lxxxiv. 11. <HI>John</HI> iii. 14&mdash;20.&mdash;4. The light directs our way, and we are influenced by the objects which we view, to avoid what appears odious or dangerous, and to pur&s;ue what we think is agree|able with all our might. So by faith the &s;oul flies to Chri&s;t to &s;upply all its wants, and cleaves to him in the way of holine&s;s, and is moved to watch again&s;t all iniquity, and to crucify the fle&s;h, with its affections and lu&s;ts: This was the whole tenor of my book, which therefore I intituled, <HI>True Faith will produce good Works;</HI> but this title Mr. <HI>M&mdash;n</HI> denies, and attempts to prove the contrary, though before he proceeds to any proof, he again brings up his frightful imagination, if po&s;&s;ible to prepo&s;|&s;e&s;s the reader's mind. But hoping that the reader will not be guilty of the folly of judging a mat|ter before he hears it, I would de&s;ire him to take notice what it is that is now to be proved. It is, that "<HI>True faith</HI> doth &s;ometimes fail of produc|ing good works," p. 25. <HI>True faith,</HI> which I de|&s;cribed to be <Q>A receiving with <HI>all the heart</HI> the witne&s;s and te&s;timony that God hath given us.</Q> Faith, by which the &s;oul views <Q>The <HI>precept</HI> to be true and excellent, therefore to be
<PB N="26" REF="011971_0024_0F92A458EF6A8108">obeyed; the <HI>promi&s;e</HI> to be &s;ure and &s;ufficient, therefore he &s;hall be &s;upported, and pre&s;ents eternal things as <HI>near</HI> and <HI>real,</HI> therefore to be regarded without delay,</Q> p. 33, 35. of my book. This is the con&s;tant idea that I gave of true faith; yet the fir&s;t text that my opponent brings to prove that it &s;ometimes fails of producing good works, is <HI>John</HI> xii. 42, 43. which inform us of &s;ome rulers who believed on Je&s;us, but did not confe&s;s him, becau&s;e they loved the prai&s;e of men more than the prai&s;e of God. His &s;econd is <HI>John</HI> viii. 30&mdash;32. where we find &s;ome <HI>Jews</HI> who had a &s;ort of belief on <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> but he &s;ignified to them that a <HI>continu|ance</HI> in his word would di&s;cover whether they were his <HI>di&s;ciples indeed</HI> or not; and that di&s;covery was &s;oon made, for his only telling of them that they &s;hould <HI>know the truth,</HI> and the <HI>truth &s;hould make them free,</HI> rai&s;ed their re&s;entment. Now if men can be|lieve the go&s;pel with <HI>all their hearts,</HI> and yet love the prai&s;e of men more than the prai&s;e of God, if they can be <HI>true believers,</HI> and yet not <HI>know the truth,</HI> nor be <HI>made free</HI> by it, then he has proved his point; if not, he has done nothing towards it.</P>
<P>To introduce his next proof he tells us, that love is a labour, and we may be &s;ure that it is a work which God will not forget, <HI>Heb.</HI> vi. 10. and then turns us to 1&s;t <HI>Cor.</HI> xiii. 2. in order to prove that true faith may be without love, p. 26. But it is pity the man had not read on to the next ver&s;e, which contains as much of a proof that giving <HI>all our goods to feed the poor</HI> may be without <HI>love,</HI> as the other does that a faith of miracles may be with|out it; and both prove that all external works or gifts will not avail us, without they are done from
<PB N="27" REF="011971_0025_0F92A459B2E82290">right principles; but how does that prove that true faith will not produce love and good works? In the la&s;t ver&s;e of that chapter the Apo&s;tle &s;ets faith before charity, and in <HI>Gal.</HI> v. 6. he &s;ays, <HI>Faith works by love,</HI> and I wonder how Mr. <HI>M&mdash;n</HI> thinks any can love and &s;erve God here but only by faith, &s;ince tho&s;e objects are invi&s;ible to &s;en&s;e. <HI>Peter</HI> &s;hews, that the way in which &s;aints <HI>love</HI> and <HI>rejoice</HI> in an <HI>un&s;een</HI> Chri&s;t, is by <HI>believing,</HI> 1&s;t <HI>Pet.</HI> i. 8. and <HI>Paul</HI> &s;hews <HI>faith unfeigned,</HI> as well as charity, to be &s;o e&s;&s;ential to true obedience, that all teaching that <HI>&s;werves</HI> therefrom he calls <HI>vain jangling,</HI> 1&s;t <HI>Tim.</HI> i. 5&mdash;7. and I leave others to judge, who are now guilty of &s;uch ignorant jangling.</P>
<P>To fini&s;h his proofs, our author turns us to the many nominal believers in our land, who&s;e faith does not produce good works; to which he might have &s;een an an&s;wer in my 57th page, where I ob|&s;erved, that the Apo&s;tle <HI>James</HI> compares &s;uch a faith to a <HI>dead body;</HI> but who would reject all bo|dies, becau&s;e there are &s;ome dead &s;tinking ones? We read of the <HI>&s;pirit of faith,</HI> and of <HI>living by faith;</HI> and tho&s;e pretenders to faith and grace who do not live &s;o, <HI>Jude</HI> calls them <HI>filthy dreamers;</HI> but who will argue that our waking views do not go|vern our conduct, becau&s;e <HI>dreams</HI> do not common|ly bring men off from their &s;luggi&s;h beds! <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays to &s;ome bad profe&s;&s;ors among the Chri&s;tians, <HI>Awake</HI> to righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;in not; for &s;ome have not the knowledge of God: I &s;peak this to your &s;hame!

Neither meet|ings, days, nor ordinances, can be ob&s;erved aright without faith; and if we are true believers, we <HI>are come to the General A&s;&s;embly, and church of the fir&s;t-born, which are written in heaven,</HI> chap. xii. 22, 23.

<P>Again, though &s;ome make much u&s;e of <HI>Paul</HI>'s caution again&s;t letting any man judge us in re&s;pect of an <HI>holy-day, new-moon, &s;abbath-days,</HI> or <HI>ordi|nances;</HI> yet how plain is it, that he is there &s;peak|ing

<P><HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> ordinances were types of things to come, but Chri&s;tian ordinances are memorials of what is already done, and to &s;tir us up to a right behaviour towards God, and towards each other; therefore let us never take what was written again&s;t the cere|monies of the law, to exclude any appointment of the go&s;pel: And &s;ince the Son of God re&s;ted from the work of purcha&s;ing our redemption, on the fir&s;t day of the week, and we have the example of his di&s;ciples meeting on that day, for wor&s;hip, and to break bread, <HI>John</HI> xx. 19, 26. <HI>Acts</HI> xx. 7.

<P>Having given a little &s;ketch of the &s;cripture au|thority for the&s;e duties, I can freely leave it with every con&s;cience to judge, whether it looks more like <HI>denying &s;elf,</HI> and taking up our <HI>cro&s;s daily,</HI> to

<P>How far tradition may have in&s;nared and blind|ed good men, with re&s;pect to the&s;e things, I do not pretend to &s;ay: I have experienced enough in other traditions, to teach me the importance of treating all men with candour and charity, and yet to abhor the <HI>lukewarmne&s;s</HI> which many would cover under tho&s;e lovely names, whereby religion is treated as if it was only a piece of &s;tate policy,

<P>The great point which brought ruin upon the <HI>Jews,</HI> was their refu&s;ing to <HI>render to God the fruits of his vineyard in their &s;ea&s;ons;</HI> but in&s;tead of it, abu&s;ing his &s;ervants, and then killing his Son, with this aim,&mdash;<HI>The inberitance &s;hall be ours, Matt.</HI> xxi. 33&mdash;41. <HI>Mark</HI> xii. 1&mdash;9.

<P>AFTER I had written the principal part of that di&s;cour&s;e upon faith, which I have now been vindicating, Mr. <HI>Sandeman</HI>'s letters were put into my hands, with a reque&s;t that I would care|fully examine them, and remark on what I di&s;|covered to be ami&s;s; in doing of which, &s;ome things appeared to me to be of &s;o dangerous a na|ture, that I thought it a duty to expo&s;e them pub|licly; and accordingly in&s;erted a few remarks in my introduction, referring to the body of the di&s;|cour&s;e for a po&s;itive opening of my views of the right way. But a number of people, not ob&s;erv|ing that in a note, page 25, I had thus referred them forward, and &s;uppo&s;ing that the grand de|&s;ign of my writing was again&s;t him, have accu&s;ed me of the &s;ame crime I charge upon him, <HI>viz.</HI> of only picking out what was wrong in writers, and pa&s;&s;ing over what was right. Whereas my fir&s;t and main de&s;ign had no concern with him, and as he owns that he has adopted the good &s;entiments of others, <Q>Without quoting them, or mentioning their names,</Q> how could I do ju&s;tice in reciting
<PB N="44" REF="011971_0041_0F92A46BC72792D0">them as his, when I knew not who&s;e they were? Therefore I cited one excellent pa&s;&s;age, and then endeavoured to point out &s;ome of the mo&s;t dan|gerous &s;nares that I di&s;covered in his writings, re|ferring to the following di&s;cour&s;e to explain my views of the truth. Neverthele&s;s I freely acknow|ledge, that my love of brevity left &s;ome things in too much ob&s;curity, e&s;pecially upon the di&s;tinction between doctrinal and experimental knowledge. My idea of the difference is, that a per&s;on may truly be &s;lain by the law, and made alive by the go&s;pel, and yet not know, perhaps not have a thought, that what he has experienced is the change called conver&s;ion; but doctrinal teaching may be a means of opening clearly to him, that it is the very change de&s;cribed in &s;cripture by that name. Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples had experienced <HI>the way</HI> of acce&s;s to the Father, yet they denied that they <HI>knew</HI> it, when he mentioned it under that name, <HI>John</HI> xiv. 4, 5. On the other hand, men may learn to talk orthodoxly or critically concerning the&s;e things, while they do not truly know them. This is the di&s;tinction I meant, and the occa&s;ion of mentioning it was, his repre&s;enting that a man could not have <Q>Known and preached, tru&s;ted, and loved the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t for many years,</Q> if now his mind was <HI>relieved</HI> and his <HI>views</HI> more <HI>cleared</HI> by his writings; and I &s;till think that re|pre&s;entation to be fal&s;e; But I u&s;ed one expre&s;&s;ion that I now utterly retract, <HI>viz. right</HI> notions in the head, without knowing the truth in the heart; for I believe right ideas will always produce right effects upon our hearts and lives, and that all mens notions about truth, which do not produce &s;uch
<PB N="45" REF="011971_0042_0F92A46E3054ECC0">effects, are not <HI>right</HI> notions; but a holding the <HI>truth in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>changing truth into a lie;</HI> and tho&s;e who receive not the love of the truth will be damned, becau&s;e they <HI>believe not the truth;</HI> but <HI>believe a lie, Rom.</HI> i. 18, 25. 2d <HI>The&s;.</HI> ii. 10&mdash;12. and one well ob&s;erves, that perhaps the lie they believed was, <Q>That if they did penance, and performed a number of good duties, they &s;hould by that means procure an intere&s;t in the ju&s;tifying righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t.</Q> And how much has this &s;trong delu&s;ion &s;pread through the world! Indeed the modes of <HI>doing</HI> are very differ|ent, &s;ome placing it more in external forms, others in internal exerci&s;es; and though they &s;eem to dif|fer greatly, yet how many agree in <HI>doing for life,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>receiving all by faith,</HI> that they may <HI>live unto God!</HI> Probably &s;ome will &s;ay, the&s;e are Mr. <HI>S&mdash;u</HI>'s &s;entiments: I know he &s;ugge&s;ts many &s;uch things in his writings, and I would never op|po&s;e truth there any more than el&s;ewhere; but I have &s;een as good wheat laid to bait a net, as that which is laid up in the garner; and an apprehen|&s;ion of a &s;nare for &s;ouls, baited with choice truths and keen turns of wit, was the only occa&s;ion of my writing again&s;t him; which &s;nare appears in &s;uch terms as the&s;e <Q>A&s;&s;urance of hope is enjoy|ed only by tho&s;e who give all diligence to ob|tain it, in the &s;elf-denied works of obedience;</Q> and he &s;ays, <Q>No man can be charged with the &s;in of di&s;believing the go&s;pel, for <HI>doubting</HI> if he be a good Chri&s;tian; his chief hazard lies on the other &s;ide;</Q> yet in an&s;wer to his friend's re|que&s;t of a clearer explanation of this point, he &s;ays, <Q>We mu&s;t not con&s;ider the per&s;on advanc|ing

This law then con&s;tituted an union of heart between the whole &s;y&s;tem of rational beings, which influenced to all right behaviour toward each

But who ever heard adjudge give in a &s;entence, the imme|diate effect of which would bring him&s;elf from the bench to the bar, as a guilty pri&s;oner? Since therefore rea&s;on is already bia&s;ed, divine revelation is erected as the tribunal to decide this controver|&s;y: And wherever it truly takes place, it produces the effect ju&s;t now mentioned; a notable in|&s;tance of which we have recorded, <HI>Acts</HI> xxiv. 24, 25.

<PB N="63" REF="011971_0060_0F8805C539C08BC0">was remarkably changed; for the <HI>Roman</HI> judge in&s;tantly becomes a <HI>trembling</HI> pri&s;oner, while the pri&s;oner is the King's officer to &s;ummon him to an|&s;wer for his conduct at the awful bar. This was &s;o di&s;agreeable that he <HI>put-off</HI> any further hearing for <HI>that time,</HI> and we have no grounds to think that the <HI>convenient &s;ea&s;on</HI> he flattered him&s;elf with ever came; and if not, then he is now a <HI>&s;pirit in pri&s;on;</HI> while the record of his ca&s;e &s;tands for a warning to all others again&s;t the like <HI>di&s;obedience,</HI> while the long-&s;uffering of God waits with them, 1&s;t <HI>Pet.</HI> iii. 19, 20.</P>
<P>But alas! in&s;tead of taking warning, we all na|turally have the lawyer's di&s;po&s;ition, who was wil|ling to <HI>ju&s;tify him&s;elf;</HI> his mind was bia&s;ed that way: But how could he do it? Why he leaves God out of the que&s;tion, and &s;ays, <HI>Who is my neighbour?</HI> This is a notable way to try rebels! for the judge to leave the King out of the que&s;tion, and only examine their behaviour to each other!

This condemns all tho&s;e who would either abate the law to bring it down to our ability, or in the lea&s;t turn off its authority, and their obliga|tion always to obey it, becau&s;e of their inabi|lity.</P>
<P>However, though the attempt has often been made to ju&s;tify &s;elf by leaving God out of the que&s;tion, yet no rational per&s;on could ever entirely era&s;e out of his mind an apprehen&s;ion of a deity; therefore the common way, ever &s;ince man con|tracted a di&s;like to the true God, has been to make fal&s;e ones to &s;uit their own turn.

Some make up a deity in their minds, &s;o fond of devotion, as to accept them for good wor&s;hipers, although they &s;ecretly grind the faces of the poor, and &s;hut their hearts and hands again&s;t the needy. Others, viewing that way to be odious, frame an imagination of one who cares little for devotion, if men are but hone&s;t and kind to their neighbours. Though a third &s;ort, not choo&s;ing to be under either of the&s;e re&s;traints, frame a god that loves liberty, and their tongues would &s;et him &s;o high as not to concern him&s;elf with the conduct of worms, but leave them to gratify their own inclinations, provided they do but act as good fellows with each other; yet af|ter all their great <HI>&s;welling words,</HI> they make their airy deity to be &s;uch an one as they &s;corn to be

<P>From what has been proved, I appeal to every con&s;cience whether the following conclu&s;ions are not certain truth.</P>
<P N="1">I. That all the love and good behaviour that we can po&s;&s;ibly have to our fellow-creatures, while our hearts are not truly united to our Creator, want the nature of true obedience, as much as the love and good order that may be in an army of rebels, wants of true obedience to their lawful Sovereign; when they are not reconciled to him.</P>
<P N="2">II. The rea&s;on why all men do not judge it to be &s;o, is, becau&s;e their <HI>under&s;tandings</HI> are <HI>darkened</HI> by an <HI>alienation</HI> and <HI>bias</HI> the other way, <HI>Eph.</HI> iv. 18. Therefore,</P>
<P N="3">III. For them to &s;et up their rea&s;on again&s;t di|vine revelation, either to exclude any part of it, or to turn it a&s;ide from its plain genuine meaning, is as criminal as it can be for a <HI>bla&s;ed</HI> judge to a&s;|&s;ume a power to <HI>di&s;pen&s;e</HI> with any of the King's laws, or by fal&s;e glo&s;&s;es and fal&s;e evidences to <HI>per|vert</HI> them from their ju&s;t de&s;ign, in order to ac|quit the guilty, or to condemn the innocent.</P>
<P N="4">IV. All rea&s;onings for an abatement of the law, or for the neglect of pre&s;ent obedience to it, be|cau&s;e
<PB N="66" REF="011971_0063_0F8805C779D728D0">of our impotency, are pleas for the wor&s;t kind of trea&s;on and robbery; for God is infinitely lovely, and de&s;erving of all our love, wor&s;hip and obedience, and the only rea&s;on why we cannot yield him all, is, becau&s;e we do not <HI>Like to retain him in our knowledge,</HI> but <HI>love</HI> and &s;erve the <HI>crea|ture</HI> in&s;tead of the <HI>Creator;</HI> one &s;etting up <HI>gain,</HI> and another his <HI>belly,</HI> in God's place, thus <HI>robbing</HI> him of his right, <HI>Rom.</HI> i. 24, 27. <HI>Tim.</HI> vi. 5. <HI>Phil.</HI> iii. 19. <HI>Matt.</HI> iii. 7&mdash;9.</P>
<P N="5">V. All pleas again&s;t &s;urrendering this moment to divine &s;overeignty, and receiving his proclama|tion of mercy in the go&s;pel with all our hearts, are nothing but pleas &s;till to adhere to the devil again&s;t the eternal God! They often &s;ay they cannot be|lieve; but the only way that they have to keep from believing, is to &s;hut their eyes and ears again&s;t the light and evidence of <HI>truth,</HI> and to join with the prince of darkne&s;s and his in&s;tru|ments to try to &s;et up <HI>fal&s;hood</HI> in its &s;tead. They pretend to enquire for evidence of the truth of God's <HI>promi&s;e,</HI> while they are <HI>willingly ignorant</HI> that all things in <HI>heaven</HI> and <HI>earth</HI> have evidenced the power and truth of his <HI>word</HI> from the beginning, and will do &s;o to the <HI>day of judgment, and perdition of ungodly men,</HI> 2d <HI>Pet.</HI> iii. 4&mdash;7. All pleas for not believing the go&s;pel, are pleas to <HI>make God a liar,</HI> and to adhere to the <HI>father of lies</HI> in&s;tead of him, 1&s;t <HI>John,</HI> iii. 8. and v. 10.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Therefore it is perfectly <HI>con&s;i&s;tent</HI> for him plainly to &s;et life and death before all men by the mini&s;try of his word, and call them all to <HI>turn and live;</HI> although he does not intend to exert his almighty power to &s;ave any others but

<P N="7">VII. To make the doctrine of God's &s;ecret de|crees any objection or excu&s;e again&s;t a pre&s;ent and con&s;tant regard to his revealed will, is nothing le&s;s than to deny either his ability or his right to go|vern us; for it is e&s;&s;ential to good government, to have a plan laid by the ruler, as well as rules given to the &s;ubject, to which each &s;hould adhere in its place; and mu&s;t not unbia&s;ed rea&s;on give in, that the more compleat the plan is, and the le&s;s need of alteration, the better? And &s;hould you hear a per&s;on &s;ay, <Q>If I thought it was not in my power to penetrate into the King's &s;ecrets, or to <HI>alter</HI> his coun&s;els, I would never pretend to obey his laws,</Q> would you think him to be a &s;ubject or a rebel! Yet what can mens objections again&s;t the <HI>unalterable</HI> nature of the divine decrees, mean le&s;s than this? It is e&s;&s;ential to moral government, that laws and rules &s;hould be given to men in a conditional form, enforced with the con&s;ideration of the rewards of obedience, and puni&s;hments of di&s;obedience: And the ju&s;t ruler will ever keep thereto in his admini&s;trations; but that is &s;o far from excluding a &s;ecret plan, that it nece&s;&s;arily implies &s;uch an one; it implies, that as far as the ruler's wi&s;dom and power can reach, he will be provided for all that &s;hall happen, &s;o as to be rea|dy to do him&s;elf and his &s;ubjects ju&s;tice, and not to be di&s;appointed, nor lo&s;e his or their rights in any in&s;tance.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e the art of man cannot &s;et the <HI>Arminian</HI> notion of grace in a fairer light than this, <HI>viz.</HI> our late King, after the mo&s;t criminal rebels were
<PB N="68" REF="011971_0065_0F87CE7B08234850">executed, pardoned others, and yet put them up|on the trial of &s;ome difficult &s;ervice for a time, be|fore he confirmed their e&s;tates and privileges to them; &s;o that their future welfare was <HI>&s;u&s;pended</HI> upon their doings. But then you mu&s;t know, that as he had neither atonement for their crimes, nor power to change their hearts, if he had par|doned the chief rebels, it would have endangered the peace of the kingdom, if not his own crown, and there was rea&s;on for holding others in &s;u&s;pence, becau&s;e he did not know their hearts, nor what their future conduct would be; and do men wor|&s;hip &s;uch a God as that! Again, law and ju&s;tice require that each one has his due, but many in|volve them&s;elves &s;o as not to be able to pay their debts, and rather than lo&s;e all, many creditors will take up with a little part of their ju&s;t due, and for|give the re&s;t; and &s;ome, in hope of future gain, will tru&s;t the &s;ame per&s;ons again. This agrees with <HI>Arminian</HI> notions. But a few years ago there was an act made which emboldened a number of vil|lains to launch out and get as much as they could of others e&s;tates into their hands, in hopes of be|ing re&s;cued from ju&s;tice by this pretended act of grace. This is like the <HI>Antinomians:</HI> Both of them would &s;et up mercy to the injury of ju&s;tice and truth, in&s;tead of meeting God at the true mercy-&s;eat, where they agree and ki&s;s each other. Both are for keeping off, one in hopes of com|pounding, or el&s;e of paying his debts with coun|terfeit money; the other to indulge him&s;elf as long as he can, with hopes at la&s;t to e&s;cape ju|&s;tice by pleading the bankrupt-act.</P>
<P>But let not men thus delude them&s;elves, our eternal King is a <HI>ju&s;t God,</HI> as well as a <HI>Saviour, I&s;a.</HI>
<PB N="69" REF="011971_0066_0F87CE7C90DAED18">xlv. 21. and he will &s;ee that ju&s;tice is done through the univer&s;e, and every &s;oul &s;hall be either brought to a reckoning here, and receive a clear di&s;charge by our glorious &s;urety, yea and <HI>quickly</HI> too; or el&s;e be ca&s;t into that <HI>pri&s;on</HI> from whence they can by <HI>no means</HI> come out till they have paid the <HI>utter|mo&s;t farthing, Matt.</HI> v. 25, 26. And there is not a &s;inner upon earth that believes his debts to be &s;o great as they are, nor that they are &s;trictly ju&s;t, till they are brought to a fair reckoning by the &s;pirit of truth; and 'tis well known, that if a cre|ditor &s;hould cancel a debt, and the debtor &s;till thought that it was unju&s;tly charged, he could not heartily love him for it; therefore God brings every debtor, let him owe five hundred pence, or but fifty, to know that he is ju&s;t, and that they have <HI>nothing to pay, when</HI> he <HI>frankly forgives them, Luke</HI> vii. 42. And tho&s;e who are forgiven, are &s;o far from de&s;iring to be tru&s;ted again with a &s;tock in their own hands, that they dur&s;t not tru&s;t them&s;elves; they de&s;ire ever to <HI>tru&s;t in the Lord</HI> with all their hearts, and not &s;o much as <HI>lean to their own under&s;tandings, Prov.</HI> iii. 5, 6.</P>
<P>And now, kind reader, where is the ab&s;urdity and incon&s;i&s;tency of this plan? to hold that we have de&s;troyed our&s;elves, and that all our help is in a &s;overeign God, who of his <HI>own will</HI> begets &s;ouls with the <HI>word of truth,</HI> and therefore calls us to <HI>lay apart</HI> every thing that tends to hinder our re|ceiving it <HI>under&s;tandingly</HI> and <HI>heartily,</HI> and to watch again&s;t the devil's arts to <HI>catch it away, Jam.</HI> i. 18&mdash;21. <HI>Matt.</HI> xiii. 19&mdash;23. And are not tho&s;e Satan's in&s;truments, who u&s;e their art either to keep people from coming to hear the word, or to
<PB N="70" REF="011971_0067_0F87CE7C9C786FD8">arm them again&s;t regarding it when they do come! Surely they are, therefore beware of them, as you regard your immortal &s;ouls. One of their mo&s;t artful &s;nares is to in&s;inuate, that earne&s;t addre&s;&s;es to mens minds betoken pride in the &s;peaker; but though pride often operates in teachers as well as hearers, yet as it is exalting &s;elf, two of its never-failing fruits are deceit and bitterne&s;s; a deceitful handling of the word to &s;uit their own ends, and bitterne&s;s if they are cro&s;&s;ed therein, <HI>Prov.</HI> xiii. 10. <HI>Mic.</HI> iii. 5. while humility, which exalts the Sa|viour, and aba&s;es &s;elf, ever produces faithfulne&s;s and love, and moves the preacher to renounce di&s;|hone&s;ty, and a deceitful handling of the word, and by manife&s;tation of the truth to commend him&s;elf to every man's con&s;cience in the &s;ight of God, 2d <HI>Cor.</HI> iv. 2. But <HI>Ahab</HI> owned plainly that he <HI>hated</HI> &s;uch a preacher, and would allow him no better lodgings than a <HI>pri&s;on,</HI> nor better fare than <HI>bread</HI> and <HI>water</HI> of <HI>affliction,</HI> while he was willing deli|cately to maintain four hundred flatterers, though they &s;oon lead him on to ruin, 1&s;t <HI>Kings,</HI> xxii. 6&mdash;35. And alas! how much is there at this day of the &s;ame temper in the world, that had rather maintain four hundred flatterers than one faithful dealer!</P>
<P>The apo&s;tle <HI>Jude,</HI> in de&s;cribing tho&s;e who turn grace into la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s, &s;ays, Wo unto them, for they have gone in the way of <HI>Cain.</HI> who becau&s;e his doings were not accepted, was <HI>very wroth,</HI> and turned away to the noi&s;y world; after which, like <HI>Balaam,</HI> they run <HI>greedily,</HI> who coun&s;elled <HI>Balak</HI> to lay a &s;nare to draw <HI>I&s;rael</HI> into &s;in; and to guard again&s;t conviction, they, like <HI>Core,</HI> accu&s;e God's

<P>To conclude, &s;ince precept and promi&s;e are united and ever go together in the go&s;pel plan, in vain do men attempt to &s;eparate them: Every &s;oul that truly believes the go&s;pel, has with <HI>Jacob</HI> got what God <HI>has &s;aid,</HI> both to direct his conduct and to &s;upport him therein; and as truth declares, that <HI>If any man will do, he &s;hall know, John</HI> vii. 17. therefore all the attempts that are made by tho&s;e who would be accounted believers, to excu&s;e them|&s;elves from openly profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;t, or to excu&s;e their neglect of a faithful di&s;charge of the duties of a member of his church, either from the plea of ignorance or inability, are nothing better than attempts to ju&s;tify &s;elf, at the expence of God's honour! For as &s;urely as he is true, he will never fail both to direct and &s;upport every one who tru&s;ts in him, and is willing to obey him. Then let none deceive them&s;elves with the notion of be|ing &s;aints, if their hearts and lives are not govern|ed and &s;upported by truth; and if we are &s;o, it will move us to a con&s;cientious u&s;e of all the means which God has appointed, both of a pub|lic and private nature, to learn, and to promote truth in the world, and to avoid and watch again&s;t all that is contrary thereto.</P>

<P>IT is a ju&s;t ob&s;ervation of an excellent writer, that ancient cu&s;tom and modern fa&s;hion are two tyrants, which &s;hare the empire of the world be|tween them; the truth of which often appears, both in civil and religious affairs. The name of the <HI>good old way,</HI> &s;eems enough to prejudice many again&s;t the lea&s;t variation from the cu&s;toms of their fathers, and &s;o again&s;t reformation; while others are &s;o fond of novelties, as to be ea&s;ily carried about with <HI>every wind of doctrine,</HI> that comes under a new and &s;pecious name, with exclamations again&s;t old <HI>traditions.</HI> And though believers will regard the truth when they find it, for its own &s;ake, yet it adds to their comfort to meet with others who know the &s;ame, which comfort is increa&s;ed when they can commune with tho&s;e who have lived long before them: Therefore having lately met with &s;ome things concerning the fathers of this coun|try, which may &s;erve to confirm the foregoing di&s;|cour&s;e, and al&s;o to correct the mi&s;takes of many, both in our denomination, and that are oppo&s;ite thereto, who imagine that this doctrine was in an|cient days peculiar to the Pedobapti&s;ts, I think it proper to in&s;ert a &s;ketch thereof here.</P>

The olde&s;t Bapti&s;t church in this land is at <HI>Pro|vidence,</HI> which was planted under the conduct of Mr. <HI>Roger Williams;</HI> and we may well conclude, that tho&s;e who followed him into the great dangers and hard&s;hips of his exile, had a good liking to the doctrines which he taught, and what they were we may gather from the various accounts we have of him.</P>
