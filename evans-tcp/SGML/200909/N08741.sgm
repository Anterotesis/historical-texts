<HEAD>A DIALOGUE between a MINISTER and his PARISHIONER, concerning the HALF-WAY-COVENANT.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pari&s;hioner.</SPEAKER>
<P>SIR, this third vi&s;it I am come to make you, for I have lately read a piece, printed at <HI>New-London,</HI> entituled, "A dialogue between a mini&s;ter and his pari&s;hioner, concerning the half-way-covenant <HI>con|tinued;</HI>" &s;aid to be written by one of the mo&s;t learned and ingenious mini&s;ters in the colony. I hope, therefore, now, if ever, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;uch a patron, to be able to car|ry my point,&mdash;In&s;tructed by him, I give up the half-way-covenant; I grant there is but one covenant. I give up the half-way-practice too, as founded only in ignorance, and the mi&s;taken notions of the vulgar. I am convinced, that he that is qualified to have his children baptized, is e|qually qualified to come to the Lord's-table.&mdash;I come, therefore, to claim bapti&s;m for my child, and a place at the Lord's-table for my&s;elf, as my proper right. p. 6.&mdash;How|ever, I am not well plea&s;ed at the publication of our di&s;|cour&s;e in my fir&s;t vi&s;it, altho' I mu&s;t confe&s;s you have gi|ven a fair repre&s;entation of what pa&s;&s;ed, becau&s;e being very dull at that time, I make but a very indifferent figure in the eyes of the public. p. 2.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mini&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be comforted, my friend, no blame is laid on you by the public. I bear it all; and I am willing to bear it for your good: and methinks you have only cau&s;e of joy and thankfulne&s;s; for, to be convinced, &s;o &s;oon, of your mi&s;take, is no &s;mall favour. No doubt the voice of the clergy, who practice the half-way, declaring as one man, that he, who is qualified to offer his child, to bapti&s;m, is e|qually qualified to come to the Lord's-table, has wrought your conviction; for your former faith and practice were
<PB N="4" REF="011174_0003_0F857FDF9DAB7D50">
grounded merely on the cu&s;tom of the country: this led you to think, that the Lord's-&s;upper was more holy than bapti&s;m. But while you hear all the mini&s;ters, with whom you conver&s;e, declare, they mean no &s;uch thing; they prac|ti&s;e the half-way only in conde&s;cention to the ignorance and groundle&s;s, un&s;criptural &s;cruples of the common people, you are convinced; you give up the point: you own the com|mand of Chri&s;t, <HI>do this in remembrance of me,</HI> is binding on all his di&s;ciples.&mdash;But, pray, upon what grounds, do you now &s;o boldly claim bapti&s;m for your child?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Altho' I was "uncommonly dull and muddy," in my fir&s;t vi&s;it; yet <Q>you know, &s;ir, what I wanted was to have my child baptized. As you told me there was but one covenant, &s;o we were agreed, that I had entered in|to that covenant, the very &s;ame covenant that you entered into three and thirty years ago, when you was ad|mitted into the church. And, &s;ir, why may I not have the &s;eal of it &s;et upon my child? p. 4.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did not I expre&s;sly tell you, that <Q>If the covenant owned is the covenant of grace, and if the parent acts un|der&s;tandingly &amp; hone&s;tly in the affair, he is a good man, he has a right before God to bapti&s;m for his children, and an equal right to the Lord's-&s;upper? But that if the covenant owned is not the covenant of grace, tho&s;e who have owned it, have in the &s;ight of God no right to either of tho&s;e ordinances which are &s;eals of that covenant, and of no other: no more right than if they had given their a&s;&s;ent to any chapter in the aprocrypha?</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, you did &s;o&mdash;and there is but <HI>one covenant,</HI> &s;ays my patron.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>This covenant then is the covenant of grace, which, we are all agreed, requires repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t: or el&s;e there is no covenant of grace at all&mdash;for he &s;ays there is but one.&mdash;But lay your hand upon your heart, and tell me the truth hone&s;tly, did you mean to profe&s;s repentance toward God &amp; faith toward our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, when you owned the covenant? or in other words, did you mean to profe&s;s a compliance with
<PB N="5" REF="011174_0003_0F857FDF9DAB7D50">
the covenant of grace? Pray, &s;ir, recollect and repeat the very words you &s;pake to me in your fir&s;t vi&s;it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>You make me blu&s;h&mdash;for I told you the truth in my fir&s;t vi&s;it, from the bottom of my heart; and this is what I &s;aid, <Q>I knew my&s;elf to be unconverted.&mdash;I meant to own the covenant, as the phra&s;e is, and have my chil|dren bapti&s;ed; but I had no de&s;ign to profe&s;s godline&s;s, or to pretend a real compliance with the covenant of grace. This godly people may do; but it had been great hypocri&s;y in me to do it. To lie to men is bad, but to lie to God is wor&s;e. I &s;uppo&s;ed that owning the cove|nant was what the unconverted might do.</Q> The&s;e were my very words: and on the&s;e principles I acted, as do all others, that I am acquainted with, who own the covenant, have their children bapti&s;ed, and do not come to the Lord's table; and I verily tho't this was right before my fir&s;t vi&s;it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>How is it po&s;&s;ible a man, &s;o hone&s;t as you <HI>then</HI> ap|peared to be, &s;hould <HI>now</HI> act &s;uch a di&s;hone&s;t part, as you have done? It is my duty as a mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, to rebuke you &s;harply; for <HI>then</HI> you told me, as you <HI>now</HI> own, that you did not mean to profe&s;s a compliance with the covenant of grace, upon which I denied bapti&s;m to your child; and yet <HI>ju&s;t now</HI> you pretended you did mean to do it.&mdash;You have need to blu&s;h&mdash;This deliberate di&s;&s;imulation in &s;uch an affair, is no &s;mall crime. Did your learned patron advi&s;e you to this &s;tep, to get your child bapti&s;ed? Is this the way to obtain God's ble&s;&s;ing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be this as it may, I am willing now to make a pro|fe&s;&s;ion, and publickly to enter into covenant with God, and I have no objection again&s;t the form u&s;ed in your church. I can make that covenant, and &s;peak truly in the &s;ight of God, notwith&s;tanding I know I have no grace. p. 6, 7.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can a man who knows he has no grace profe&s;s a compliance with the covenant of grace, without wilful lying?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not mean to make a profe&s;&s;ion that &s;hall imply con|ver&s;ion. There would be '&s;pecial hypocri&s;y' in doing &s;o. p. 14.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then! do you &s;uppo&s;e the unconverted do com|ply with the covenant of grace? That the unconverted have
<PB N="6" REF="011174_0004_0F857FE01A637670">
repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t? That the unconverted choo&s;e the Lord Jehovah for their &s;overeign Lord and &s;upreme good thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and give up them&s;elves to his &s;ervice, to walk in all his ways, &s;eeking his glory?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, &s;ir, by no means. But <Q>if it be true that the Lord Jehovah is my &s;overeign Lord and &s;upreme good thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t. i. e. if it be true, that he who thro' Chri&s;t is the author of being, and of every mercy, to all the liv|ing, is the &s;overeign Lord and &s;upreme good of every living &s;oul, 'tis no harm to avouch it.</Q> I mean to give my a&s;&s;ent to this truth, and no more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Doth not the devil believe the truth of this propo&s;i|tion as firmly as any wicked man does? and is he in cove|nant? You have need to be better in&s;tructed about the nature of entering into covenant with God, before you can be con|&s;idered as qualified in point of doctrinal knowledge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, &s;ir, I am not &s;o ignorant neither. I know in what &s;en&s;e you mean to under&s;tand your covenant. But knowing my&s;elf to be unconverted, I cannot profe&s;s a compliance with the covenant of Grace in that &s;en&s;e. I cannot pro|fe&s;s &s;upreme love to God, and that I do actually take him as my God, my chief good, thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t. This is not in my heart. Therefore I mean to adopt the words of the covenant in a different &s;en&s;e; even in a &s;en&s;e, in which, an unconverted man, who is at enmity again&s;t God, may u&s;e them, and yet &s;peak true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>But this is not to profe&s;s a compliance with the co|venant of Grace. And therefore &s;hould you make it, it could give you no right to &s;ealing ordinances for your&s;elf or your child. Rather is it gro&s;s and &s;candalous di&s;&s;imu|lation, very much like what is practi&s;ed by <HI>Arians</HI> and <HI>Socini|ans</HI> among the clergy of the church of <HI>England,</HI> when they &s;ub&s;cribe the 39 articles, in order to qualify them&s;elves for a benefice upon the e&s;tabli&s;hment; which practice is con|demned by all hone&s;t men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be this as it may, I can at lea&s;t, with moral &s;incerity promi&s;e, "To walk in all his ways and keep all his com|mands, &s;eeking his glory." p. 7.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>The obedience engaged by one who profe&s;&s;es a com|pliance with the covenant of grace is that kind of obedience which the covenant requires, viz. An holy obedience, an obedience which proceeds from faith and love. And do you mean to engage this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, by no means. I mean only to engage what an unconverted man may do, while &s;uch. p. 7. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Other writers maintain, that &s;uch as know them&s;elves to be uncon|verted, when they join in full communion with the church, are to en|gage that very kind of obedience required in the covenant of grace, from that time and forward till they die. They are not to profe&s;s that they have as yet loved God, believed in Chri&s;t, repented of their &s;ins, or liv|ed holy lives, but they are to engage that they will do all this as &s;oon as ever they have Joined with the church, and from that time forward till they die. This is Mr. <HI>Beckwith</HI>'s &s;cheme, An&s;wer to Mr. <HI>Green,</HI> p. 26. &mdash; If the&s;e profe&s;&s;ors are &s;o near being converted in their own judgments, really and hone&s;tly, that they do expect to be actually converted as &s;oon as they have joined with the church, it is a pity they do not put off their public profe&s;&s;ion till the next &s;abbath; and &s;o be converted fir&s;t: and then they might make a full profe&s;&s;ion of a pre&s;ent compliance with the covenant of grace, and &s;o the whole controver&s;y might be ended. This is always the way that hone&s;t people take when they enter into the marriage covenant, to which this writer compares this tran&s;action. They do not come and pre&s;ent them&s;elves before the prie&s;t to enter into the marriage covenant, till they begin to love each other. And now they can with a good con&s;cience give their con&s;ent to the whole marriage co|venant, as being con&s;cious to them&s;elves that they already have &s;uch an heart in them. But &s;hould a pair offer to be married, who had thro' their whole court&s;hip, and to that moment, been at enmity again&s;t each other, as much as <HI>Paul</HI> declares every <HI>carnal mind</HI> to be <HI>again&s;t God.</HI> Rom. 8.7. It would be looked upon as a hypocritical, mad and &s;tupid piece of conduct.</NOTE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>But this unholy obedience is not that kind of obedi|ence, which the covenant of grace requires at your hands. So that you mean to profe&s;s neither to comply with the co|venant of grace at pre&s;ent, nor to live &s;uch a holy life as it requires for the future. In &s;hort, you mean to u&s;e the words of a &s;aint with the heart of a hypocrite; and &s;o to come into Chri&s;t's vi&s;ible church, with the language of a friend; but with the heart of an enemy. Your propo&s;ed conduct may &s;erve to give a very true and ju&s;t expo&s;ition to tho&s;e words of our Saviour, <HI>Friend, how came&s;t thou in hither not having a wedding garment?</HI> As if he had &s;aid, <Q>I call
<PB N="8" REF="011174_0005_0F857FE302B373B8">
you <HI>friend,</HI> becau&s;e you, in words, make the &s;ame pro|fe&s;&s;ion which my real friends do. But why do you do this, when at the &s;ame time you have the heart of an enemy? why do you act this hypocritical part? Such di&s;&s;imula|tion is <HI>&s;pecial hypocri&s;y.</HI></Q>&mdash;If you could not comply with our covenant in its plain &s;en&s;e, and in the &s;en&s;e you knew we under&s;tood it, why did not you rather come like an ho|ne&s;t man, and &s;ay &s;o, and de&s;ire to have it laid a&s;ide; and a new covenant, an ungracious covenant introduced in its room; a covenant which you could make, and act an ho|ne&s;t part?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tho't there was but one covenant. I tho't the cove|nant you u&s;e in your church, as you under&s;tand it, was that one covenant. I tho't there was no other. I tho't that bap|ti&s;m and the Lord's-&s;upper were &s;eals of the covenant of grace, and of no other. And &s;o I mu&s;t profe&s;s a compli|ance with the covenant of grace, or I cannot be received a|mong Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples, or claim the privileges of &s;uch. Therefore I put this new &s;en&s;e on the words, that I might con&s;ent to them with a good con&s;cience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the words, in this new &s;en&s;e, are not the covenant of grace, but an ungracious covenant; in &s;en&s;e and mean|ing exactly like the half-way-covenant, in u&s;e in &s;ome churches, where they have two covenants: (A number of &s;uch churches I could name to you)&mdash;&s;o while you cry out again&s;t the name of a half-covenant, you take the covenant of grace, and turn it into the very thing, in order to bring it down to a level with your gracele&s;s heart; and then put on a bold face, and come and claim the privileges peculiar to tho&s;e, who profe&s;s a compliance with the covenant of grace it&s;elf.</P>

<P>And, O my friend, will you di&s;&s;emble in this &s;hocking manner, in order to get into the church, that you may come to the Lord's-table, and be converted!

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is not deliberate, de&s;igned di&s;&s;imulation, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn, religious tran&s;action on earth, even in covenant|ing with the great God, as bad as drunkenne&s;s?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, &s;ir, but I am expre&s;sly commanded to come to the Lord's &s;upper, by Chri&s;t him&s;elf. p. 15.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>This command was given to none but Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples. And in the apo&s;tolic age none ever pretended to attend the Lord's &s;upper, but tho&s;e who had made a profe&s;&s;ion, and were admitted into the chri&s;tian church. As yet you have not made a profe&s;&s;ion, to be &s;ure, not &s;uch a profe&s;&s;ion as God ever required; nor is the profe&s;&s;ion you now propo&s;e to make, a profe&s;&s;ion of a compliance with God's covenant, even with the covenant of grace.</P>

<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P><Q>I am able to demon&s;trate, as clearly as any theorem is demon&s;trated in Euclid, that if an unconverted man may not avouch the Lord for his God, nor re&s;olve to o|bey him, he may not &s;ay, <HI>Our Father which art in heaven&mdash; forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.</HI></Q> p. 8. And it is damnable here&s;y to teach that the unconverted ought not to pray. p. 9. And if they &s;in in praying, yet it is le&s;s &s;in to pray, than not to pray. p. 12.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a greater &s;in to lie, than to do nothing. Lying is not a means of grace. Lying is not an appointed means of conver&s;ion. There are many things unconverted &s;inners may &s;ay to God, and &s;peak true. To &s;peak the truth to God is well. Jam. 2.19. but to &s;ay that which they know is not true is a thou&s;and times wor&s;e than to &s;ay nothing. Mat. 23, 14. Acts 5.3. And for a man who is &s;en&s;ible, that it is not in his heart to forgive tho&s;e who have tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed a|gain&s;t him, and that in fact he does not forgive them, to come into the pre&s;ence of God, and pray, &s;aying, <HI>Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors,</HI> is, implicitly, to a&s;k
<PB N="10" REF="011174_0006_0F857FE31F4B71B0">
God not to forgive him; but this is a greater &s;in than not to pray at all, as all will allow; and it will hold true, as true as any "theorem in Euclid," that lying is wor&s;e than no|thing, in praying, in covenanting, and in every thing el&s;e.</P>

<P>Sir, on your plan, three-quarters of the chri&s;tian world will be &s;hut out of the church. p. 14.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were it not better, were it not more for the honour Chri&s;t and chri&s;tianity, in the &s;ight of Pagans, Jews, and Mahometans, and in the &s;ight of the ungodly in chri&s;tian countries, and more for the good of their own &s;ouls, that nine tenths &s;hould be &s;hut out of the church, if need &s;o re|quire, than to come in by wilful lying! But for a man to profe&s;s a compliance with the covenant of grace, when he knows he has no grace is no better; and yet without &s;uch a pro|fe&s;&s;ion no man can vi&s;ibly enter into covenant with God. For God has no other covenant extant, of which bapti&s;m and Lord's-&s;upper, are &s;eals; for there is but one covenant, as you allow; and to u&s;e the words of this covenant in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e, as to make it a gracele&s;s half-covenant, gives no more right to &s;ealing ordinances, than to repeat any chapter in the apocrypha.</P>

<P>"Every bapti&s;ed per&s;on is a member of Chri&s;t's vi&s;ible church: but I was bapti&s;ed in my infancy, therefore I have a right to all the external privileges of a church-member." p. 16.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>You remember the an&s;wer I gave to this, at your &s;econd vi&s;it, viz. <Q>Bapti&s;m alone in the apo&s;tolic age, never made any adult per&s;on, a church-member, without a profe&s;&s;ion &mdash;profe&s;&s;ion was fir&s;t made, &amp; then they were bapti&s;ed. Tho&s;e therefore that are bapti&s;ed in infancy, in order to be members in this &s;en&s;e, mu&s;t make a profe&s;|&s;ion, when they become adult. The New-England churches, therefore, are right in demanding it.</Q></P>

<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mu&s;t then have a half-covenant for the&s;e half-members.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, by no means. They are bound by their parent's act and deed, to comply with the covenant of grace it&s;elf, as &s;oon as they become adult. With this covenant, &amp; with this alone do we urge them to comply. Whenever they appear to do it, we receive them to full communion. But if they o|penly renounce the God of their fathers &amp; ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;t in it, they mu&s;t be con&s;idered and treated as per&s;ons who have vi&s;ibly renounced their bapti&s;m, in which their parents devoted them to God thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t to be for ever his.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is equally certain the go&s;pel contains no rule to de|termine with certainty that men are orthodox, or found in the faith. They may make an orthodox profe&s;&s;ion, but we can|not be certain that they mean as they &s;ay. To be &s;ure, if they allow them&s;elves to u&s;e orthodox words in a heterodox &s;en&s;e, as you do in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of covenanting; and the truth is, let the qualifications be what you plea&s;e, it is not nece&s;|&s;ary the church &s;hould have a certainty that the candidates

for admi&s;&s;ion to &s;ealing ordinances have them really and in the &s;ight of God. It is &s;ufficient, on every &s;cheme, that they appear to have them to a judgment of charity regu|lated by the word of God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Such incon&s;i&s;tency may by no means be charged on the Deity, as to in&s;titute an ordinance with a de&s;ign that never can be carried into execution; as is the ca&s;e, it Chri&s;t has not given &s;ome infallible criterion or mark, whereby to know who may be admitted. p. 9. 10.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, &s;ir, be plea&s;ed to take the incon&s;i&s;tence to your &s;elf, until you can be infallibly certain, that the candi|date for admi&s;&s;ion is really orthodox and morally &s;incere in the &s;ight of God, as &s;earcher of hearts. And in order to this, you will need the aid of that enthu&s;ia&s;tical &s;ort of people of whom your mini&s;ter &s;peaks; (p. 10.) for it cannot be known, without an immediate revelation. You mu&s;t get their <HI>&s;pirit</HI> to come and tell you, whether men are as ortho|dox and morally &s;incere in the &s;ight of God, as they profe&s;s to be before men. For their is no infallible mark whereby you can certainly know it. An immediate revelation is ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for this, "As I am able to demon&s;trate as clearly as any theorem is demon&s;trated in Euclid."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be this as it may; whether the church mu&s;t be certain or not; yet we our&s;elves mu&s;t be certain, that we have the nece&s;&s;ary qualifications, or we mu&s;t not come. p. 10.</P>

<P>We are naturally as con&s;cious of volitions as of &s;pe|culations, of love as of belief, when ever we look into our own hearts, as all will allow. A man who&s;e mind is waver|ing between Arminiani&s;m and Calvini&s;m, inclining &s;ome|times to one &s;ide from the corrupt bia&s;&s;es of his heart, and &s;ometimes to the other, by the force of evidence, may not be able to &s;ay, which he believes. So a man who&s;e mind is wavering between God and mammon, inclining &s;ome|times to one ma&s;ter with a view to his future intere&s;t, and &s;ometimes to the other from an attachment to his pre&s;ent, may not be able to &s;ay, which ma&s;ter upon the whole he choo&s;es, for <HI>the double minded man is un&s;table in all his ways.</HI> But Chri&s;t does not de&s;ire men to make a profe&s;&s;ion of be|ing

his di&s;ciples till they have &s;at down and counted the co&s;t, and are come to a &s;ettled determination; as is plain from Luke 14.25&mdash;33. And when men are come to that &s;ettled determination, which our Saviour there de&s;cribes, they may &s;ay, that they have come to it. And this is all the profe&s;&s;ion which we de&s;ire.</P>

<P>Thus far I have acted the part of a di&s;putant, and I have now done. Suffer me therefore once more to rea&s;|&s;ume that hone&s;t character which I &s;u&s;tained in my fir&s;t vi&s;it; for let others &s;ay, what they will, I de&s;ign to act an hone&s;t part. Now the truth of the ca&s;e is this, I am not &s;pecially concerned to know by what rule the church mu&s;t be governed in admitting members, neither am I concerned to know what they mu&s;t do who are in doubt about them&s;elves; the only que&s;tion about which I am exerci&s;ed relates to my own particular ca&s;e. I know I have no grace. I know I am unconverted. I told you &s;o at fir&s;t, and &s;o I have told all the mini&s;ters with whom I have conver&s;ed; and how any man, that knows he has no grace, can profe&s;s a compliance with the covenant of grace, &amp; &s;peak true, I could not under&s;tand years ago. It was this that induced me to own the cove|nant, as the phra&s;e is, &amp; not to join in full communion, that &s;o I might have my children bapti&s;ed. Not one of the mini|&s;ters with whom I have conver&s;ed, appears to ju&s;tify the prin|ciples upon which I acted; but all as one man, &s;ay, there is but one covenant, &amp; this one covenant is the covenant of grace: indeed they explain away the covenant of grace, till they bring it down into a gracele&s;s covenant, and then tell me I can comply with that, and ought to do &s;o, and thus join in full communion. But you have fully convinced me of the incon&s;i&s;tence and ab&s;urdity of this; and yet I would beg leave to enquire, why might not the covenant of grace be voted out, by the church, and a gracele&s;s covenant be &s;ub|&s;tituted in its room? and then &s;uch as I am could con&s;i&s;t|ently profe&s;s a compliance with &s;uch a covenant, and have bapti&s;m for their children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if a church &s;hould vote out the covenant of grace, or which is the &s;ame thing in other words, &s;hould vote out

chri&s;tianity, how could it any longer be con&s;idered as a vi|&s;ible church of Chri&s;t, or as having a vi&s;ible right to the vi&s;ible &s;eals of God's covenant?&mdash;And be&s;ides, &s;hould you bind your child to one of your neighbours, to learn &s;ome mechanic art, why, in this ca&s;e, might not the cove|nant be &s;ealed, ratified and confirmed by the admini&s;trati|on of bapti&s;m, <HI>In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Gho&s;t?</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>The propo&s;al &s;hocks my mind. It would be a profana|tion of God's holy ordinance, to take God's &s;eal, appropri|ated to God's covenant, and put it to man's covenant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>But this ungracious covenant is man's covenant, and not God's. And to take God's &s;eal, appropriated to God's covenant, even to the covenant of grace, and apply it to a covenant which God never made, to a covenant made by men, is to profane the holy ordinance: and knowingly to profane God's holy ordinance is not a duty, nor is this to put our&s;elves in the way of a ble&s;&s;ing.</P>

<P>What need is there of any covenant at all?</P>

<P>It is not the manner of men to put a &s;eal to a clean piece of paper. Nor did God ever appoint &s;eals to be put to a blank. God's &s;eals were appointed to be put to God's covenant; and we have no right to put them to a blank: and be&s;ides, it would be to give up the import of the acti|ons, and to render &s;ealing ordinances unmeaning, empty, u&s;ele&s;s ceremonies.</P>

<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_IF we may judge of the &s;entiments of mini&s;ters, in general, by the pieces lately publi&s;hed on this con|trover&s;y, all are agreed in the&s;e three propo&s;iti|ons, viz.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. <HI>There is but one covenant, a profe&s;&s;ion of a compliance with which is requi&s;ite to an admi&s;&s;ion into the vi&s;ible church of Chri&s;t, in complete &s;tanding.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. <HI>Tho&s;e who really comply with this covenant have, in the &s;ight of God, an equal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">ght to bapti&s;m for their children, and to the Lord's-&s;upper for them&s;elves.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>III. <HI>All &s;cruples to the contrary are groundle&s;s and un|&s;criptural.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>There is therefore, but one &s;ingle point, which now needs to be &s;ettled, to &s;ettle the whole controver&s;y, viz. <HI>With what covenant are we to profe&s;s a compliance, the covenant of grace, or a gracele&s;s covenant?</HI></P>
<P>And this point is of &s;uch a nature, that it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ettle it, before we proceed to act at all in church affairs; in gathering a church, &s;ettling a mini&s;ter, admitting mem|bers, or admini&s;tring &s;ealing ordinances. For 'till this is &s;ettled, we know not upon what covenant the church is to be formed, nor what covenant is to be profe&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e who are to be admitted, nor what covenant is to be &s;eal|ed by bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper, nor what covenant the mini&s;ter is to preach up and hold out to public view, as the thing to be complied with by profe&s;&s;ors and to be &s;ealed by the &s;acraments. So that if we mean to proceed like rational creatures, in our church-affairs, we mu&s;t look this matter to the bottom, and come to a determination.</P>
<P>To &s;ay, that it is needle&s;s to determine this point, is the &s;ame thing as to &s;ay, that it is of no con&s;equence whether our churches are founded on a right covenant, or on a wrong one; or whether God's &s;eals are fixed to the co|venant he de&s;igned, or to a covenant to which he never in|tended they &s;hould be affixed; which none will care to &s;ay: For, if it is of no con&s;equence what covenant we profe&s;s, nor what covenant we &s;eal, a right one, or a wrong one; it is
<PB N="iii" REF="011174_0010_0F857FE8C585AA70">
&s;urely of no con&s;equence whether we profe&s;s or &s;eal any covenant at all; which to &s;ay, is to tear up by the roots all notion of a vi&s;ible church in the world. But to &s;et a|&s;ide a vi&s;ible church, as a needle&s;s thing, is to &s;et a&s;ide chri&s;tianity, as an impo&s;ture. There mu&s;t be chri&s;tian churches; there mu&s;t be a public profe&s;&s;ion of &s;ome cove|nant or other; there mu&s;t be &s;ealing ordinances; the&s;e or|dinances mu&s;t be admini&s;tered by the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t to the proper &s;ubjects; it mu&s;t be determined who they are; it mu&s;t, therefore, be determined on what covenant church|es are to be formed, and what covenant is to be preached up, profe&s;&s;ed and &s;ealed. It is a controver&s;y, which no hone&s;t man, who means to have any thing to do in church-affairs, can let alone, as a mere circum&s;tantial point. Much le&s;s can tho&s;e, who are already in the mini&s;try, or are about to &s;ettle in that work, con&s;i&s;tently content them&s;elves to proceed without any &s;ettled &s;cheme at all; unle&s;s all they aim at, is to live a quiet life, right or wrong; which is what none will profe&s;s to do.</P>
<P>OUR churches were originally founded on a profe&s;&s;ion of a compliance with the covenant of grace, at lea&s;t, gene|rally. And, indeed, I know not of one church in New-England, of our own denomination, which is now other|wi&s;e founded, if we may judge of their foundation by the words of the covenant which is read to tho&s;e who are ad|mitted to full communion. So far as I know, the for|mulas in u&s;e, expre&s;s the chief things contained in the co|venant of grace, &amp;c. "That they avouch the Lord to be their God and chief good, and give up them&s;elves to him, thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to live to him and &s;eek his glory." And therefore, &s;hould we be convinced, that the covenant of grace is not the covenant with which the church of Chri&s;t ought to profe&s;s a compliance, there ought to be an altera|tion in our formulas. For, as they &s;tand at pre&s;ent, they tend to lead all per&s;ons who&s;e con&s;ciences are awake, to think they ought to be converted, before they make a profe&s;|&s;ion of religion, &amp; join in full communion with the church. For, &s;uch do not think it right to profe&s;s a compliance with
<PB N="iv" REF="011174_0011_0F857FEA549754F0">
the covenant of grace, when they know they have no grace. Nor do they think it con&s;i&s;tent with moral hone&s;ty, to give their con&s;ent to the covenant in a &s;en&s;e different from it's plain and natural &s;en&s;e. There is a nece&s;&s;ity, therefore, if the covenant of grace is not the covenant which ought to be entered into, to call our churches together, to point out to them plainly this fundamental error in their con&s;ti|tution, and to lead them to vote out the covenant of grace, and to vote in a gracele&s;s covenant, in order to open a wide and effectual door to let ungodly men as &s;uch, into our churches. And in this method, may be adapted regularly, the new &s;cheme advanced, by the <HI>Rev. Mr. Mo&s;es Mather,</HI> an ingenious writer, in his piece lately publi&s;hed, entitled, "The vi&s;ible church in covenant with God," &amp;c.</P>
<P>This author has offered this doctrine of an <HI>external grace|le&s;s covenant</HI> to public con&s;ideration, as taught in <HI>the word of God,</HI> and as the only con&s;i&s;tent plan on which the vi&s;ible church can be founded, and infant bapti&s;m vindicated. He had no de&s;ire, it may be pre&s;umed, that his &s;cheme &s;hould be received by our churches without examination. The &s;tricte&s;t &s;crutiny cannot hurt the truth. The truth, like the &s;un, can bear to be looked upon, without any diminu|tion of its lu&s;ture. A glow-worm is in danger of lo&s;ing its brightne&s;s, if the light of day &s;hines around it. This may be the nature of error; but the truth it&s;elf, the more &s;trictly it is examined, the more will it appear to be like <HI>the morning light, which &s;hines more and more to the perfect day.</HI></P>
<P>Our confe&s;&s;ion of faith and plan of church di&s;cipline have determined for "the covenant of grace," declaring that "&s;acraments are holy &s;igns and &s;eals of the covenant of grace;" and for the nece&s;&s;ity of a profe&s;&s;ion of a "cordial &s;ubjection to Je&s;us Chri&s;t." But the&s;e are not <HI>the word of God.</HI> Mr. Mather undertakes to prove his doctrine from <HI>the word of God.</HI> And we ought, with the utmo&s;t readi|ne&s;s, to give up all human compo&s;ures, when found incon|&s;i&s;tent with <HI>the word of God.</HI> He appeals to &s;cripture: we join in the appeal; and let him that readeth, under&s;tand.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. I.</HI> The nature of Mr. M's external, gracele&s;s covenant it's difference from the covenant of grace, and a general view of the &s;ubject.</HEAD>
<P>BY the <HI>covenant of grace,</HI> Mr. M. means, that covenant with which every true believer complies in the exer|ci&s;e of repentance towards God and faith towards our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and which promi&s;es pardon and eternal life to all who comply with it. Or to u&s;e his own words, "A &s;ure promi&s;e of eternal life, to all &s;uch, as with a true heart, believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t." P. 4. And in this we are agreed. But he maintains, that this is not the covenant, a compli|ance with which is to be publickly profe&s;&s;ed by any of the followers of Chri&s;t, when they join in full communion with the church. It is a chief de&s;ign of this piece to prove this point. And in this we differ.</P>
<P>BY the <HI>external covenant,</HI> he means, not the covenant of grace, externally entered into, by a public profe&s;&s;ion of a compliance with it, which is what &s;ome divines have meant by the phra&s;e; but a covenant &s;pecifically different from the covenant of grace. It differs from it in three things. (1.) The covenant of grace requires holine&s;s, a holy faith, a holy repentance, a holy obedience: The external cove|nant requires no holine&s;s at all. (2.) The covenant of grace is complied with by none but the regenerate, in the exerci&s;e of holine&s;s: The external covenant may be complied with by the unregenerate, by tho&s;e that have no grace, in un|gracious, unholy exerci&s;es. (3.) The covenant of grace promi&s;es eternal life: The external covenant promi&s;es no &s;uch thing; but leaves tho&s;e who comply with it, &amp; do no more, under the &s;entence of the divine law to eternal death. This appears through the whole performance. We main|tain

that there is no &s;uch covenant&mdash;he endeavours to prove that this is the only covenant, a compliance with which was profe&s;&s;ed by Abraham, by the I&s;raelites in the wilder|ne&s;s and by the apo&s;tolic converts, when they entered vi|&s;ibly into covenant with God, and became members of God's vi&s;ible church; as will be plain to any one that reads his book. We affirm that a profe&s;&s;ion of a compliance with this covenant never was required by God of any man.</P>
<P>THERE is a covenant of grace, indeed, according to Mr. M. which promi&s;es eternal life to the true believer, to which this external covenant, he &s;ays, &s;erves, as means to the end; p. 9. But a compliance with this covenant of grace never was required, and never was profe&s;&s;ed, in or|der to &s;ealing ordinances, under the old te&s;tament or the new; for the &s;eals were not de&s;igned primarily to be &s;eals of the covenant of grace, but of a gracel&s;s covenant, with which gracele&s;s men may comply in the &s;ight of God, while &s;uch. And &s;o there is no need of a compliance with the covenant of grace, in order to a con&s;i&s;tent attend|ance on &s;ealing ordinances. P. 36, 37. As gracele&s;s men may comply with this gracele&s;s covenant; &s;o they may con&s;i&s;tently be active in &s;ealing it. And &s;o there is not the lea&s;t need of our being born again, or the lea&s;t occa&s;ion of a profe&s;&s;ion of godline&s;s, or making any pretence of love to God or Chri&s;t; or to vital piety in order to a regular admi&s;&s;ion into the church of Chri&s;t. We need not be &s;aints in reality, or in profe&s;&s;ion; in the &s;ight of God, or in the &s;ight of men; no &s;uch thing is required: no &s;uch thing is pretended. For "The external covenant does not re&s;pect a gracious &s;tate of heart, as the qualification requi&s;ite, to a per&s;on's entering into it." P. 22. <HI>A church of Chri&s;t, there|fore, is a congregation, in which, there is no vi&s;ible profe&s;&s;ion made of real chri&s;tianity;</HI> i. e. <HI>of friend&s;hip to Chri&s;t, or of chri&s;tian grace, or of any thing but what is con&s;i&s;tent with a &s;tate of total enmity to God and Chri&s;t, and to all &s;piritual good.</HI> This is Mr. M.'s idea of a vi&s;ible church; and any higher profe&s;|&s;ion, he thinks, of very bad tendency. P. 51, 52, 53.</P>
<P>IF the lea&s;t &s;park of grace is required in the external co|venant,
<PB N="7" REF="011174_0012_0F857FEB8EB00668">
or if the lea&s;t &s;park of grace is profe&s;&s;ed in vi&s;ibly entering into it, then the man that knows he has no grace, but is dead in &s;in, cannot make a profe&s;&s;ion, and Mr. M.'s end is fru&s;trated, which was to open a wide and effectual door for &s;uch as know them&s;elves to be ungodly to join in full communion with the church.</P>
<P>AND if this external covenant does not require the lea&s;t degree of grace or holine&s;s; then it requires nothing but ungracious, unholy, &s;inful performance, (for Mr. M. will not choo&s;e to &s;ay, that their is a &s;y&s;tem of religious voliti|ons, affections and actions, which are neither virtuous nor vicious, neither holy nor &s;inful, neither conformable to the holy nature and law of God, nor unconformable; for this would be to &s;uppo&s;e that the divine law is not a univer&s;al rule of life.)&mdash;So that, altho' Abraham and all Abraham's &s;piritual &s;eed, when they fir&s;t comply with the covenant of grace exerci&s;e real holine&s;s, and live in the exerci&s;e of holi|ne&s;s thro' the cour&s;e of their lives, agreeable to our Savi|our's character of them, in Mat. 7.24. and attend the means of grace in a holy manner, (Mat. 13.8.) and even hate and abhor that impenitent, &s;elf-righteous, &s;inful manner in which all the ungodly attend them, (Prov. 15.8.) Yet when they come to make a public profe&s;&s;ion, they are to covenant and promi&s;e to attend all means in no better man|ner, than that, in which, impenitent, &s;elf-righteous &s;inners do. For they are publickly to profe&s;s and promi&s;e nothing but a compliance with the external covenant: and the ex+ternal covenant requires nothing more.&mdash;And having made this ungodly profe&s;&s;ion, and by covenant bound them&s;elves to attend all means of grace in this manner, they &s;et to it God's appointed &s;eal; and this unholy covenant the mo&s;t holy Chri&s;tian is to renew and &s;eal every time he comes to the table of the Lord till he dies; which, how it can po&s;&s;ibly be done with a good con&s;cience, Mr. M. has not yet told us.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The external covenant it a gracele&s;s covenant, &s;uited to the hearts of gracele&s;s men. Therefore to be in heart conformed to the external covenant, is to have a heart de&s;titute of grace. Every true convert there|fore renounces the external covenant in his heart at the time of his con|ver&s;ion, and complies with the covenant of grace. Nor can he ever go back to the external covenant in his heart without falling from grace. So that if Abraham was in the covenant of grace before, as Mr. M. &s;ays he was, p. 8. then he fell from grace when he entered into the external covenant. And if by &s;ealing the external covenant he obliged him&s;elf to conform to it as long as he lived, he did thereby bind him&s;elf to con|tinue unconverted till death. But the covenant with Abraham was an <HI>everla&s;ting covenant.</HI> Gen. 17, 7. To which Abraham was obliged to conform in heart and life as long as he lived.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="011174_0013_0F857FEC22AC7ED0">THUS we have taken a brief and general view of Mr. M.'s &s;cheme of an external gracele&s;s covenant. I think I under&s;tand him right.

What is the doctrine of the bible? the only book we are obliged to believe and obey on pain of God's eternal wrath. And the que&s;tion is, What is God's covenant, which is to be profe&s;&s;ed and &s;ealed; a gracious, or an ungracious covenant? What was the Abrahamic co|venant? and what the covenant into which the I&s;raelites pro|fe&s;&s;ed to enter in the wilderne&s;s? and what is that covenant revealed in the go&s;pel, of which bapti&s;m and the Lord's-&s;upper are &s;eals? an holy covenant? or an unholy one?</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="011174_0013_0F857FEC22AC7ED0">But before we enter on the &s;ubject, it may not be im|proper to ob&s;erve, that Mr. M. has given up the grounds on which Mr. <HI>Jonathan Dickin&s;on,</HI> and after him Mr. <HI>Peter Clark,</HI> vindicated infant bapti&s;m, viz. That the covenant with Abraham was the covenant of grace. See Mr. <HI>Clark's defence of infant bapti&s;m, ch.</HI> iv. in which the covenant with Abraham is proved to be the covenant of grace; and Dr. <HI>Gill's</HI> objections, in his piece again&s;t Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on;</HI> &s;ome of them the &s;ame with Mr. <HI>Mather's,</HI> are an&s;wered.&mdash; And Mr. M. endeavours to lay a new foundation for in|fant bapti&s;m, perhaps never before laid by any writer on that &s;ubject, viz. An external gracele&s;s covenant; and what the effect among common people will be, if they &s;hall &s;ee Mr. M.'s external covenant proved to be a mere non-entity, cannot yet be known. But if any are &s;haken in their be|lief of infant bapti&s;m, when they find Mr. M.'s foundation give way under them, they ought to remember, that the defenders of infant bapti&s;m have not built their arguments on this foundation, but always on a &s;uppo&s;ition, that the covenant with Abraham was the covenant of grace.</P>

<P>Now the&s;e are the contents of the covenant with Abra|ham, in Gen. 12; where it is fir&s;t of all mentioned; <Q>Now the Lord had &s;aid unto Abram, get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's hou&s;e, unto a land that I will &s;hew thee.

Hear what an in&s;pired apo&s;tle &s;aith, Gal. 3.8. <HI>And the &s;cripture fore&s;eeing that God would ju&s;tify the heathen thro' faith, preached before the</HI> GOSPEL <HI>unto Abraham, &s;aying,</HI> IN THEE SHALL ALL NATIONS BE BLESSED. And in Gen. 12.4; follows an account of Abraham's com|pliance. <HI>So Abram departed, as the Lord had &s;poken unto him.</HI> He did not merely "endeavour," but he actually complied. And was this done <HI>in faith,</HI> or in <HI>a gracele&s;s</HI> manner? Take the an&s;wer from an in&s;pired writer.

<P>AND this &s;ame covenant was renewed on GOD'S part in Gen. 15.5. <HI>And he brought him forth abroad, and &s;aid, look now toward heaven, and tell the &s;tars, if thou be able to number them. And he &s;aid unto him, &s;o &s;hall thy &s;eed be.</HI> And in ver: 6, follows Abraham's compliance; <HI>and he believed in the Lord.</HI> And the very next words determine, that this was not Mr. M.'s external covenant, in a compliance with which no man is ju&s;tified, and that Abraham's faith was a true ju&s;tifying, &s;aving faith; <HI>and he counted it to him for righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>AND in chap, 17. This &s;ame covenant was renewed again,
<PB N="11" REF="011174_0014_0F857FECDDF44620">
with this additional declaration, <HI>I am God almighty,</HI> ab&s;olute|ly all-&s;ufficient. For he had before &s;aid, chap. 15. <HI>I am thy &s;hield, and exceeding great reward;</HI> which is &s;omething of a higher nature than what is promi&s;ed by Mr. M.'s exter|nal covenant; yea, it is added, <HI>to be a God to thee, and thy &s;eed after thee.</HI> In con&s;equence of which he was called <HI>the God of Abraham, the God of I&s;aac, and the God of Jacob:</HI> and what is implied in this we may learn from, Heb. 11.16. <HI>Wherefore God is not a&s;hamed to be called their God; for he hath prepared for them a city.</HI> Yea, all the great ble&s;&s;ings of the go&s;pel are &s;ummed up in one promi&s;e, Rev. 21.7. <HI>He that overcometh &s;hall inherit all things,</HI> AND I WILL BE HIS GOD.

<P>Mr. M.'s external covenant requires no higher kind of faith, than the devil has, &amp; nothing but ungracious, unholy obedience, which tho&s;e who are dead in &s;in may perform: But neither this faith nor this obedience were the faith and obedience of Abraham. Mr. M.'s covenant requires what <HI>James</HI> calls a <HI>dead faith,</HI> by which no man can be ju&s;tified; but Abraham's was a <HI>living faith,</HI> by which he was ju&s;tified, and by which all others will be ju&s;tified who have it. And his obedience was an holy obedience, &s;uch as is peculiar to the friends of God. Mr. M.'s external covenant, is adapt|ed to the temper and &s;tate of the unconverted, requiring only &s;uch religious exerci&s;es as may take place in them: But Abraham was not in an unconverted &s;tate; and &s;o Mr. M.'s external covenant was not adapted to the temper and &s;tate in which he was, if the reader will be at the pains to take his bible and turn to Gen. 12, and read the whole hi&s;|tory of Abraham's life, he will not find the lea&s;t hint of more than one covenant with Abraham; nor was one un|holy duty ever required at his hands: rather, on the con|trary, the&s;e were the expre&s;s words of God Almighty to him, <HI>walk before me, and be thou perfect.</HI>&mdash;If therefore we judge of the nature of the covenant with Abraham, as we do of all
<PB N="12" REF="011174_0015_0F857FED9B2C7390">
other written covenants, viz. By the contents of the written in&s;trument, there is no room to doubt.</P>
<P>AND now this covenant being thus made, and thus re|newed from time to time, thro' the &s;pace of above twenty years, an external &s;eal was at length by GOD appointed to it. For circumci&s;ion was appointed as a token of this very covenant, which was made with Abraham before he was circumci&s;ed. For an in&s;pired apo&s;tle has &s;aid it. Rom. 4.9, 10, 11. <HI>Cometh this ble&s;&s;edne&s;s,</HI> (viz. that &s;poken of in the foregoing ver&s;e, <HI>ble&s;&s;ed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute &s;in) then upon the circumci&s;ion only, or upon the un|circumci&s;ion al&s;o? for we &s;ay, that faith was reckoned to Abra|ham for righteou&s;ne&s;s. How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumci&s;ion, or in uncircumci&s;ion? not in circumci&s;ion, but in uncircumci&s;ion. And he received the &s;ign of circumci&s;ion, a &s;eal</HI> (not of Mr. M.'s external covenant, but) <HI>of the righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of the faith which he had yet being uncircumci&s;ed; that he might be the father</HI> (not of tho&s;e gracele&s;s men, that enter into Mr. M.'s gracele&s;s covenant, but) <HI>of all them that be|lieve;&mdash;that righteou&s;ne&s;s might be imputed to them al&s;o.</HI> That all who comply with that covenant as Abraham did him|&s;elf, might be ju&s;tified and &s;aved, as he was. From all which it is evident, that that covenant with which Abra|ham vi&s;ibly complied, when in obedience to GOD'S call, he &s;eperated him&s;elf and his family from the idolatrous world, to wor&s;hip the true GOD only, and to believe in, and wait for the coming of the Me&s;&s;iah, who&s;e <HI>day he &s;aw, and was glad,</HI> was not Mr. M.'s external gracele&s;s covenant, by which no man can be ju&s;tified and &s;aved; but the covenant of grace, which promi&s;es eternal life to tho&s;e who comply with it; <HI>for God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</HI> Mat. 22, 31, 32; and that circumci&s;ion was a &s;eal of this very covenant. Which were the points to be proved.</P>
<P>There is not one text in the new-te&s;tament where the na|ture of the covenant with Abraham is pointed out, but that it is &s;poken of as the covenant of grace; for it is always &s;poken of as the way, and as the only way in which a &s;in|ner can be ju&s;tified. Particularly, read the fourth chapter
<PB N="13" REF="011174_0015_0F857FED9B2C7390">
of the epi&s;tle to the Romans, and the 3d, and 4th chapters to the Galatians, and this will appear in the cleare&s;t light. For, from the manner in which Abraham was ju&s;tified, Paul illu&s;trates and confirms the go&s;pel way of ju&s;tification. For he con&s;iders Abraham as the pattern, and teaches that all &s;inners are ju&s;tified in the &s;ame way in which he was; and in this &s;en&s;e he is <HI>the father of many nations,</HI> as he is <HI>the father of all that believe.</HI> Rom. 4: 16, 17. <HI>For what &s;aith the &s;cripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Ver. 3. <HI>Now it is not written for his &s;ake a|lone, that it was imputed to him; but for us al&s;o, to whom it &s;hall be imputed, if we believe on him that rai&s;ed up Je&s;us our Lord from the dead.</HI> Ver. 23, 24. <HI>Know ye, therefore, that they which are of faith,</HI> (who are true believers) <HI>the &s;ame are the children of Abraham.</HI> Gal. 3.7. <HI>And the &s;cripture fore&s;eeing that God would ju&s;tify the heathen thro' faith, preached before the go&s;|pel unto Abraham, &s;aying in thee &s;hall all nations be ble&s;&s;ed. So then they which are of faith,</HI> (i. e. are true believers) <HI>are ble&s;|&s;ed with faithful Abraham.</HI> Ver. 8, 9. But, ver. 10, all &s;elf-righteous &s;inners are under the cur&s;e; <HI>for as many as are of the works of the law are under the cur&s;e.</HI> But ver. 13, 14. <HI>Chri&s;t hath redeemed us from the cur&s;e&mdash;that the ble&s;&s;ing of Abra|ham might come on the Gentiles thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t; that we might receive the promi&s;e of the &s;pirit thro' faith.</HI> For it is the pecu|liar privilege of believers to have the &s;pirit. Rom. 8.9. <HI>Ye are not in the fle&s;h, but in the &s;pirit, if &s;o be that the &s;pirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, he is none of his.</HI> Gal, 4.6, 7. <HI>Becau&s;e ye are &s;ons, God hath &s;ent forth the &s;pirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, abba, fa|ther.

<P>So that if we read the contents of the written in&s;trument,
<PB N="14" REF="011174_0016_0F857FEE61BD2D30">
as it is recorded in the old te&s;tament, or con&s;ider how the in&s;pired writers of the new, under&s;tood it, nothing can be plainer than that the covenant with Abraham, into which the believing Gentiles are received under the go&s;pel di&s;pen|&s;ation, was the covenant of grace, even that covenant in which, and in which alone ju&s;tification and eternal life are to be expected. Nor can Mr. M. apply the&s;e texts to his external, gracele&s;s covenant, without perverting the word of GOD in a mo&s;t &s;hocking manner. Yea, if the&s;e texts do not &s;peak of the covenant of grace by which alone &s;inners are ju&s;tified, no &s;uch covenant can be found in the bible. There was no other covenant revealed to Abraham; and Paul knew of no way of ju&s;tification but this. We have as much evidence then that the covenant with Abra|ham was the covenant of grace, as we have that there ever was a covenant of grace, exi&s;ting &s;ince the world began.&mdash; Now ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. From the nature of this covenant with Abraham we may learn the nature of GOD'S vi&s;ible church. For as a real compliance with this covenant renders us the children of Abraham indeed: So a vi&s;ible compliance with it ren|ders us vi&s;ibly the children of Abraham. And as this co|venant is but one, &s;o GOD'S church is but one; according to that article in the apo&s;tle's creed, &s;o called, "I believe in the holy catholic church." There is but one <HI>good olive tree,</HI> accord|ing to St. Paul. Rom. 11. Were there two covenants, there would be two churches, two olive trees, an&s;werable to the nature of the two covenants. But the bible knows of but one covenant with Abraham. And &s;o God's church is compared to one good olive tree. And gracele&s;s profe&s;|&s;ors are compared to <HI>dry branches,</HI> in this one good olive tree. Whereas on Mr. M.'s plan the vi&s;ible church is founded on a gracele&s;s covenant: This gracele&s;s covenant is the bond of union. So the olive tree it&s;elf, root and branch, is dead and dry, wholly gracele&s;s; and appears to be &s;o; for their is no pretence to any thing el&s;e. Yea, Mr. M. thinks it was GOD'S de&s;ign, that his real friends &s;hould keep hid, &s;o as not to profe&s;s their friend&s;hip to him
<PB N="15" REF="011174_0016_0F857FEE61BD2D30">
publickly before the world: And &s;o that GOD &s;hould have, in this &s;en&s;e, no vi&s;ible church in the world; p. 49; not one open friend upon earth. But Abraham profe&s;&s;ed to be a friend to GOD, and was by GOD publickly owned as &s;uch before the world; for he is called <HI>the friend of God.</HI> Jam. 2.23.</P>
<P N="2">2. WE may al&s;o learn that the &s;eal of the covenant of grace may with propriety be applied to &s;ome infants. For all will allow that GOD is the proper judge of propriety in &s;uch a ca&s;e. And all grant that GOD appointed circumci|&s;ion to be applied to &s;ome infants. And therefore if bap|ti&s;m is a &s;eal of the covenant of grace, yet it may be ap|plied to &s;ome infants; provided only they have the &s;ame right to bapti&s;m, that the children of Abraham had to cir|cumci&s;ion.</P>
<P N="3">3. WE may al&s;o hence learn the foundation of the right of believing Gentiles to bapti&s;m for their children. <HI>For if we are Chri&s;t's, then are we Abraham's &s;eed, and heirs according to the promi&s;e.</HI> Gal. 3.29.

FOR any church to lay a&s;ide the covenant of grace, and introduce a gracele&s;s covenant in its room, is &s;o far forth to unchurch them&s;elves: i. e. &s;o far as this has in|fluence, to render them&s;elves not a vi&s;ible church of Chri&s;t; but a &s;ociety, vi&s;ibly, of a nature e&s;&s;entially different; even, &s;o different as the covenants are. &mdash;But it is time to at|tend to the grand objection again&s;t this doctrine, that the covenant with Abraham was the covenant of grace; taken, as Mr. M. &s;ays, "from the covenant it &s;elf."

<P>OBJECTION. That the covenant with Abraham menti|oned Gen. 17. Was not the covenant of grace, is evident, not only from this, that he was in the covenant of grace before; but from the covenant it &s;elf, which was merely "as external mark in the fle&s;h." For the circumci&s;ion of the fle&s;h was the covenant: as it is written, <HI>this is my covenant.</HI> But circumci&s;ion is not the covenant of grace, but a mere external mark, which may be put upon a man that has no grace. Nay, circumci&s;ion cannot be the covenant of grace, for by neglecting to circumci&s;e a child this covenant might be broken, but there is no falling from grace. Therefore circumci&s;ion is not the covenant of grace, but an external covenant of a very different nature. P. 5, 6, 7, 8. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The rea&s;ons which induce me to think that Mr. M. means as above, are the&s;e, I. Becau&s;e, &s;peaking of the external covenant, in order, to prove, that it is not the covenant of grace, and to &s;hew the difference, he &s;ays, "that, by which, any one enters into this covenant, is an external mark is the fle&s;h; viz. Circumci&s;ion, "but that, by which, any one en|ters into the covenant of grace, is the circumci&s;ion of the heart." p. 7. By <HI>entering into covenant,</HI> he means, complying with it. For this is his ar|gument. viz. As in the circumci&s;ion of the heart, the covenant of grace is complied with; &s;o in the circumci&s;ion of the fle&s;h the external cove|nant is complied with: therefore they are not ore &amp; the &s;ame covenant, but two, of a nature as different as the&s;e two kinds of circumci&s;ions. 2. He &s;ays, P. 8. That circumci&s;ion was a cmpliance with the external covenant. The&s;e are his words, <Q>This covenant appears to be an external covenant, in that, altho' a per&s;on was in a &s;tate of grace, and was con|&s;equently included in the covenant of grace, yet this covenant remai|ned to be <HI>complied with.</HI> Abraham was a true believer before, yet he mu&s;t needs be <HI>circumci&s;ed.</HI></Q> which implies, that circumci&s;ion it &s;elf was a compliance with the external covenant. And on this hypothe&s;is, he teaches, that bapti&s;m which comes in the room of circumci&s;ion, gives a right to all the ble&s;&s;ings of the external covenant; makes us "Abraham's &s;eed, &amp; heirs according to the promi&s;e," P. 12. 13. Even bapti&s;m alone, P. 16. 59 which it could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to do, were it not &s;uppo&s;ed to be the only condition of the ble&s;&s;ings, i. e. the only thing required in the external covenant nece&s;&s;ary to give us a title to its ble&s;&s;ings.&mdash;So that we have beyond doubt Mr. M's true meening in the objection above, however incon&s;i&s;tent it is with &s;ome other things in his book; of which, hereafter, <HI>Sect.</HI> VIII.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="011174_0017_0F857FEF1E52A260">ANSW. This is the foundation of Mr. M's. &s;cheme. And perhaps there never was a fabrick built on a more &s;andy foundation. For he has mi&s;taken, the external &s;eal of the covenant for the covenant it &s;elf. Becau&s;e it is &s;aid, <HI>this is my covenant,</HI> he at once concludes, that circumci&s;ion is the very covenant it &s;elf. Ju&s;t as the papi&s;ts do in the doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation: becau&s;e it is &s;aid, <HI>this is my body,</HI> they at once conclude, that the bread is the very body of Chri&s;t it &s;elf. Whereas nothing can be plainer, than that the con|tents of God's covenant had been &s;tated, and Abraham had complied with them, above 20 years before the in&s;titution of circumci&s;ion. And this very covenant which had, from time to time, been renewed, is again renewed in Gen. 17; and an external &s;eal is appointed to it. So that nothing hin|ders but that the covenant with Abraham may be what the &s;criptures teach it to be, and what the chri&s;tian world have always thought it to be; viz. The covenant of grace: and circumci&s;ion may &s;till be, what it has been always
<PB N="18" REF="011174_0018_0F857FF10EAAA768">
thought to be; viz. An external &s;eal of the covenant of grace, which God made with Abraham. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>And if circumci&s;ion was a &s;eal of the covenant of grace, then every circumci&s;ed I&s;raelite was under covenant bonds, in all things to comply with and live up to the covenant of grace, as admini&s;tered under that di&s;pen&s;ation. Particularly, he was under covenant bounds to &s;eperate him&s;elf and his hou&s;hold from the idolatrous world, and to love and wor&s;hip the true God, and to believe in and wait for the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah, and to look for a better country, that is, an heavenly one. And he was under covenant bonds in the&s;e views and with this temper to circumci&s;e his children, and bind them in all things to comply with and live up to the covenant of grace. And to neglect this was to be guilty of the breach of the Abrahamic covenant. And tho&s;e who per&s;i&s;ted in this neglect pro|ved them&s;elves to be not the genuine children of Abraham, but rather apo&s;tates from the God of their father: and as &s;uch they de&s;erved to be cut off, according to Gen. 17.14. &mdash; for Abraham acted &s;incerely and from the heart in complying with God's call to leave his native country and in &s;eperating him&s;elf and his hou&s;hold from the idolatrous world to wor&s;hip and &s;erve the true God, to believe in and wait for the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah, looking upon the land of Canaan as a type of heaven, which was indeed the country for which he &s;ought. For this world was not his home. But he was a pilgrim and &s;tranger on earth. And all the genuine children of Abraham are of the &s;ame &s;pirit. For they <HI>do the works of Abraham,</HI> Joh. 8.39. All his &s;eed therefore according to the fle&s;h by being circum|ci&s;ed on the eighth day were bound by God to be of the &s;ame &s;pirit. And when they became adult, and children were born to them, they were bound in the &s;ame &s;pirit to circumci&s;e their childen. If they neglected to circumci&s;e their children in this &s;pirit, they broke God's covenant. If they performed the external rite of circumci&s;ing their children, they did, by that action, practically profe&s;s to be of this &s;pirit. For this was the import of the action. If their hearts were an&s;werable to their external con|duct, then they were Abraham's children indeed: and heirs not only of earthly, but al&s;o of the heavenly Canaan. If they had no love to the God of Abraham, or faith in the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah, they were pagans at heart. Or in other words, they were uncircumci&s;ed in heart; and will be con&s;idered and trented accordingly, as &s;oon as ever they &s;hall come to &s;tand before the bar of God, as &s;earcher of hearts, in the invi&s;ible world. <HI>For he is not a Jew, who is one outwardly, neither is that circumci&s;ion which is outward in the fle&s;h. But he is a Jew which is one inwardly; and cicumci&s;ion is that of the heart. But if thou be a breaker of the law thy circumci&s;ion is made uncircum|ci&s;ion.</HI> Rom. 2.25&mdash;29 However, in this pre&s;ent world, God conducted toward them not as the &s;earcher of hearts, but in the character of a vi&s;i|ble head; and therefore dealt with them according to vi&s;ible appearan|ces, tru&s;ting their profe&s;&s;ion, &s;aying, <HI>&s;urely they are my people, children that will not lie.</HI> And in this character he con&s;idered them as covenant breakers not according to what they were in heart &s;ecretly, but according to what they appeared to be in external conduct. The&s;e hints may &s;erve to &s;hew the true import of Gen. 17.14. And the meaning of Exod 4 24.25, 26.</P>
<P>There have been four di&s;pen&s;ations of the covenant of grace, the Adamaic, Abrahamic, Mo&s;aic and the Chri&s;tian. Repentance toward God and faith in the promi&s;ed &s;eed, and holine&s;s of heart and life have been equally nece&s;&s;ary in all times and under all di&s;pen&s;ations; but rites and ceremonies have been varied. Offering &s;acrifice was always practi&s;ed from the days of Adam, but circumci&s;ion was appointed to the family of Abraham. Melchizedeck and Lot were under the Adamaic di&s;pen&s;ation, therefore they practi&s;ed &s;acrificing, but not circumci&s;ion. But there ne|ver was a covenant made by God adapted to the temper and conduct of impenitent &s;elf-righteous &s;inners, requiring men to feel and act as they do, in their religious exerci&s;es and performances; but from the early days of Cain to the pre&s;ent period, God has ever refu&s;ed to &s;mell a &s;weet &s;a|vior in &s;uch &s;acrifices. The fir&s;t per&s;ecution and the fir&s;t martyr was re|lative to this point. Gen. 4.3,&mdash;8.</P></NOTE>&mdash;And if God's

<P>THE whole law of Mo&s;es, which was written in a book, compri&s;es at large all the contents of the co|venant with the I&s;raelites in the wilderne&s;s. This book,
<PB N="20" REF="011174_0019_0F857FF19A7306D0">
therefore, was called, <HI>the book of the covenant.</HI> And the lit|tle che&s;t in which it was put, from the &s;pecial u&s;e to which it was appropriated, was called, <HI>the Ark of the covenant,</HI> Deut. 31.9, 25, 26. A brief &s;ummary of this law was written on <HI>two tables of &s;tone.</HI> Deut. 4.13. Which two tables of &s;tone were, therefore, called <HI>the tables of the covenant,</HI> Deut. 9 9, 10, 11, 15; and were al&s;o put into <HI>the Ark of the covenant,</HI> Deut. 10.4, 5. So that we may be as certain of the na|ture of that covenant, as we can be of the meaning of the Mo&s;aic law.</P>
<P>THE I&s;raelites in the wilderne&s;s profe&s;&s;ed a compliance with this covenant and with no other, as is beyond di&s;pute certain from Exod. 19.8. And chap. 24.3. Deut. 5.1&mdash;6. And chap. 26. 16, 17, 18. Chap. 28. 1. 15, 58. And chap. 29. 9&mdash;13, compared with chap. 30. 10&mdash;16.</P>
<P>AND as &s;oon as they &s;hould pa&s;s over Jordan, they were expre&s;sly commanded, to &s;et up great &s;tones, and plai&s;ter them with plai&s;ter, and write upon them all the words of this law; and to build an alter, and offer &s;acrifice; and half the tribes were to &s;tand on mount <HI>Ebal,</HI> and half on mount <HI>Gerizzim,</HI> and the Levites were to &s;ay unto all the men of I&s;rael with a loud voice <HI>cur&s;ed be the man,</HI> &amp;c. that breaks this and that law, twelves times &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, accor|ding to the number of the twelve tribes of I&s;rael.

And this mo&s;t &s;olemn and affect|ing affair was accordingly attended, &s;oon after they had pa&s;&s;ed over Jordan. Jo&s;h. 8.30&mdash;35.</P>
<P>So that, by their own act and deed, they did, in the mo&s;t public and explicit manner, declare their hearty approbati|on of, and acquie&s;cence in, not Mr. M.'s external covenant, but the perfect law of GOD, in all it's &s;trictne&s;s, and with all it's cur&s;es, as holy, ju&s;t and good. Nor was there, ac|cording to that con&s;titution, any hope of pardon in ca&s;e of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, but by the blood of atonement. Nor was there any pardon to be obtained in this way, until they repent|ed, until their uncircumci&s;ed hearts were humbled, even
<PB N="21" REF="011174_0019_0F857FF19A7306D0">
&s;o deeply humbled as to accept the puni&s;hment of their ini|quity. Lev. 26.40, 41. Neh. 9. Dan. 9. Then they were to pray for pardon, looking towards GOD'S holy dwel|ling place, where the covenant was laid up in the ark, and covered with a lid all made of pure gold, to keep the law in honor, which was a type of Chri&s;t, who&s;e office it is to magnify the law, and make it honorable, and to open a way for grace to reign. That lid was called <HI>the mercy &s;eat,</HI> or rather as criticks &s;ay, it ought to have been tran&s;lated, <HI>the propitiatory;</HI> for it was a &s;hadow of Chri&s;t the <HI>Great Pro|pitiatory.</HI> And moreover, to complete the &s;hadow, <HI>without &s;hedding of blood there was no remi&s;&s;ion.</HI> Ju&s;t thus &s;tands the account in the &s;acred writings.</P>
<P>THIS cordial approbation of their law in all its extent, and with all its cur&s;es; and this praying for pardon, look|ing towards GOD'S holy dwelling place, offering &s;acrifices, &amp;c. was, for &s;ub&s;tance, the &s;ame, with what the Apo&s;tle Paul meant by <HI>repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> which was the &s;um of that go&s;pel he u&s;ed to preach to the Jew and al&s;o to the Greek; Acts 20.21. For in <HI>repentance toward God,</HI> the divine law is heartily ac|quie&s;ed in and loved as holy, ju&s;t and good; and the whole blame of every tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion is taken to our&s;elves; with a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;ay unto GOD, <HI>thou art ju&s;t when thou &s;peake&s;t, and clear when thou judge&s;t.</HI> And in <HI>faith toward our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> we look only to free grace thro' him for par|don and eternal life. So that the covenant of grace, in a legal dre&s;s, was the very covenant into which they profe&s;&s;ed to enter. So Paul under&s;tood it; Rom. 10.6&mdash;10. Compared with Deut. 30.11&mdash;14; of which more pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>BUT a heart wholly dead in &s;in, is in a &s;tate of total con|trariety to the divine law, and to the way of &s;alvation thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t; or in the language of &s;cripture, <HI>is enmity a|gain&s;t God, is not &s;ubject to his law, neither indeed can be.</HI> So that there is not the lea&s;t degree of real compliance with this holy covenant, in one who is entirely de&s;titue of holi|ne&s;s: and &s;o no degree of real compliance can be under|&s;tandingly and hone&s;tly profe&s;&s;ed. But if the truth was
<PB N="22" REF="011174_0020_0F857FF2729AC1F8">
known, and the truth was &s;poken, by gracele&s;s &s;inners, they would all as one man declare, agreeable to our confe&s;&s;ion of faith, "we are utterly indi&s;po&s;ed, di&s;abled and appo&s;ite to all good, and wholly inclined to all evil;" for this is the very truth of the ca&s;e; as Mr. M. him&s;elf profe&s;&s;es to be|lieve.</P>
<P>And where now is there the lea&s;t appearance of Mr. M.'s external gracele&s;s covenant in the old te&s;tament? The con|tents of Abraham's covenant are ju&s;tifying faith; <HI>he believ|ed in the Lord, and it was counted to him for righteou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> and go&s;pel obedience; <HI>walk before me, and be thou perfect.</HI> And he was called <HI>the friend of God.</HI> Jam. 2.23. The contents of the covenant at <HI>Sinai</HI> is the <HI>holy law of God,</HI> as the rule of life, and the blood of atonement as the foundation of hope. And where is this <HI>unholy covenant?</HI> But to be more parti|cular in the confutation of this notion.</P>
<P N="1">1. IT is readily granted, that a notion of the Sinai cove|nant, &s;omewhat like this, was once e&s;pou&s;ed by the mo&s;t re&s;pectable &s;ect in the Jewi&s;h church: I mean, the Phari|&s;ees. They under&s;tood the Mo&s;aic law in this very &s;en&s;e, and in no other. And in this they were more con&s;i&s;tent than Mr. Mather.

For both agree in this, that a man may live up to the one, and to the other, without really embracing Chri&s;tianity. They lived up to the law in their &s;en&s;e of it, and openly rejected Chri&s;t.

Mat. 23 29&mdash;36 Should light &s;till increa&s;e, and the&s;e men find out that their various &s;chemes are not contained in the bible, if left to their own hearts, they would univer&s;ally prefer infidelity to Chri&s;tianity. And in this ca&s;e there would be nothing to prevent their throwing off the profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity but their worldly intere&s;t. For it is plain fact, that the external evidences of Chri&s;tianity, when fre&s;h and before the eyes of the Phari&s;ees, were not &s;ufficient to conquer their aver|&s;ion to it, &s;o as to prevent their rejecting of it. And human nature is the &s;ame that it was &s;eventeen hundred years ago.</NOTE> Nay,

How many profe&s;&s;ors are there, who, in their con&s;ciences, view the divine law very much in the &s;ame light that the Phari&s;ees did?

<P N="2">2. JESUS CHRIST did not under&s;tand the law of Mo&s;es, which was the rule of duty in the Sinai covenant, in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e with the Phari&s;ees, as requiring &s;uch a kind of obedience as they performed, and as other unconverted men may perform; but profe&s;&s;edly &s;et him&s;elf to give another explanation of it. This he did in his &s;ermon on the Mount, which may be con&s;idered as a confutation of the Phari&s;aic &s;cheme of religion. But a man may comply with Mr. M.'s external covenant fully, who has not the lea&s;t degree of that religion taught in this &s;ermon. A gracele&s;s man may live up to Mr. M.'s covenant, and at the &s;ame time be entirely de&s;titute of a compliance with the law of Mo&s;es, in our Saviour's &s;en&s;e of it. For, &s;ays Chri&s;t, <HI>he that heareth the&s;e &s;ayings of mine, and doeth them, &s;hall be like a man that built his hou&s;e upon a rock.</HI> But a man may hear and do tho&s;e things required in Mr. M.'s external co|venant, and yet finally be like the man, that <HI>built his hou&s;e upon the &s;and;</HI> as he him&s;elf allows.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE law of Mo&s;es, which was the rule of duty in the covenant into which the I&s;raelites entered, required nothing but holine&s;s. That covenant, which was externally exhi|bited, and externally entered into, was &s;o far from being altogether a gracele&s;s covenant, that it required nothing but true grace and real holine&s;s; nothing but <HI>love,</HI> with all it's various exerci&s;es and fruits, in heart and life; <HI>love to God and man;</HI> of this we are expre&s;sly a&s;&s;ured by one who
<PB N="26" REF="011174_0022_0F857FF3E6AE05F8">
came from GOD, and infallibly under&s;tood the nature of that di&s;pen&s;ation. Mat. 22.36&mdash;40. <HI>Ma&s;ter, which is the great commandment in the law?</HI> &s;aid a Phari&s;ee to our Savi|our, referring to the law of Mo&s;es. <HI>Je&s;us &s;aid unto him, thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy &s;oul, and with all thy mind: this is the fir&s;t and great command|ment, and the &s;econd is like unto it, thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy&s;elf.</HI> Thus he had an&s;wered the Phari&s;ee's que&s;tion. But he proceeded to add another &s;entiment, which overthrew the Phari&s;aic &s;cheme by the roots. <HI>On the&s;e two command|ments hang all the law and the prophets;</HI> for if the law oblig|ed the Jew to perform every duty in a holy manner, out of love; and required no other kind of obedience but this; <HI>if all the law and the prophets hung on the&s;e two commands;</HI> &s;o that radically love was all; &s;o that this <HI>holy love</HI> was <HI>the ful|filling of the law,</HI> Rom. 13.8, 10; then the Phari&s;ees, who were entirely de&s;titute of this, were equally de&s;titute of that kind of religion required in the Mo&s;aic law, and &s;o their &s;cheme was torn up by the roots. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">It is not only a fundamental maxim in the &s;cripture &s;cheme of reli|gion that <HI>love is the fulfilling of the law;</HI> but it is expre&s;sly affirmed, that without love the highe&s;t gifts and the greate&s;t attainments, the mo&s;t ex|pen&s;ive deeds and the mo&s;t cruel &s;ufferings are nothing, and will profit nothing. The apo&s;tle Paul carries the point &s;o far as to &s;ay, <HI>though I &s;peak with the tongues of men and angels, and have not charity, I am as &s;oun|ding bra&s;s, or a tinkling cymbal;</HI> as de&s;titue of true and real virtue. <HI>And though I have the gift of prophecy, and under&s;tand all my&s;teries, and have all knowledge: and though I have all faith, &s;o that I could remove mountains, and have no charity, I am nothing.</HI> And to carry the point as high as it can po&s;&s;ibly be carried he adds; <HI>and though I be&s;tow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profit|eth me nothing.</HI> For in his view charity, or love was the &s;um total of all virtue. And &s;o there is no virtue in any knowledge, faith, or practice a|ny further then there is love in them, and &s;o where there is no love, the&s;e are all nothing. In a word, holine&s;s in the creature is a conformity to God's moral perfections. The law is a tran&s;cript of God's moral charac|ter: God is love. The whole of what the law requires is love with all it's various exerci&s;es and fruits. Therefore love is the &s;um of all virtue. Therefore where there is no love there is no virtue: not the lea&s;t degree of a real conformity to God's nature and law. Were this point under&s;tood and attended to, it would put an end to above half the di&s;putes in the Chri&s;tian world.</NOTE></P>
<P N="4">4. IT is manife&s;t, that Mo&s;es him&s;elf in&s;tructed the I&s;|raelites
<PB N="27" REF="011174_0022_0F857FF3E6AE05F8">
to under&s;tand the covenant in this &s;en&s;e, and that the ble&s;&s;ings of it were promi&s;ed, not to an ungracious, but to a holy obedience. Mo&s;es did in&s;truct the I&s;raelites to under&s;tand it in this &s;en&s;e, as requiring holine&s;s, Deut. 6.4, 5. <HI>Hear, O I&s;rael, the Lord our God is one Lord. And thou &s;halt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy &s;oul, and with all thy might.</HI> Lev. 19.18. <HI>Thou &s;halt love thy neighbour as thy &s;elf.</HI>&mdash;And as requiring nothing but holi|ne&s;s. Deut. 10.12. <HI>And now I&s;rael, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to &s;erve the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy &s;oul.</HI> &mdash;And that the ble&s;&s;ings of it were promi&s;ed to this holy obedience. This was one clau&s;e of the covenant, Exod. 20.6. <HI>Shewing mercy unto thou|&s;ands of them, that love me, and keep my commandments.</HI> And thus it was afterwards explained. Deut. 11.22. <HI>For if ye will diligently keep all the&s;e commandments which I command you to do them, to love the Lord your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him, then will the Lord drive out all the&s;e nations from before you,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. And if any man will read the fir&s;t eleven chapters of Deut. he will &s;ee with what plainne&s;s and fidelity Mo&s;es explained the covenant to the I&s;raelites: or rather let the whole book be read thro', from beginning to end in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P N="5">5. The &s;ame, kind of faith in GOD, as their conductor thro' the wilderne&s;s to the promi&s;ed land, which was a type of the heavenly Canaan, was required of the whole congre|gation of I&s;rael in their covenant, as is required of every believer, under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation, in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the captain of our &s;alvation, on whom we depend to conduct us &s;afe thro' this world to that re&s;t that remains for the peo|ple of GOD; and this they profe&s;&s;ed, when they profe&s;&s;ed to take <HI>Jehovah for their God.</HI> And for the want of this faith their carca&s;&s;es fell in the wilderne&s;s, ju&s;t as fal&s;e profe&s;&s;ors under the go&s;pel fall &s;hort of heaven <HI>thro' unbelief;</HI> as is plain from Num. 14, and from the 3d and 4th chapters of the epi&s;tle to the Hebrews. And this, beyond all di&s;pute, is a &s;aving faith, a faith of a holy nature, and not the faith of devils.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="28" REF="011174_0023_0F857FF4B89C7650">6. Paul under&s;tood Mo&s;es to include the covenant of grace in his law. This is &s;o plain, that any may &s;ee it, that will read and compare, Rom. 10.6&mdash;10, with Deut. 30.11, 12, 13.</P>
<P N="7">7. Peter al&s;o under&s;tood the holine&s;s required in the Sinai covenant to be the &s;ame kind of holine&s;s, which the go&s;pel requires of true &s;aints, and without which no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord; as is &s;o evident, that none will fail to &s;ee it, that will read and compare, 1 Pet. 1.15, 16, with Lev. 19.2.</P>
<P>Thus it appears, that the covenant externally exhibited, and externally entered into, in the wilderne&s;s, was, not a gracele&s;s, but a holy covenant.</P>
<P>Obj. <Q>It will follow, that perfect and &s;inle&s;s obedience was what they prefe&s;&s;ed"; for "nothing &s;hort of perfec|tion comes up to the demand of loving GOD with all the heart.&mdash;Altho' therefore they entered into a covenant which required them to love GOD with all their heart; yet the profe&s;&s;ion which they then made, cannot con&s;i&s;t|ently be under&s;tood as a profe&s;&s;ion that at that time, there was &s;uch an heart in them; but that &s;uch a heart was their duty, and intended as the object of their pur|&s;uit. But that an unrenewed &s;inner can, in no &s;en&s;e, be &s;aid to &s;eek &s;uch an heart, is what, to me, wants proof.</Q> P. 22, 23.</P>
<P>ANS. Altho' the I&s;raelites did not profe&s;s a perfect com|pliance with the law of perfection; yet they did profe&s;s a cordial compliance with it, even with the whole of it; but the unrenewed &s;inner can, in no &s;cripture &s;en&s;e, he &s;aid cor|dially to comply with it, in the lea&s;t degree. But to be more particular,</P>
<P N="1">1. IN this objection Mr. M. grants one main point for which we contend, viz. That the law, which was the rule of duty in the Sinai covenant, required perfect holine&s;s. He mu&s;t therefore acknowledge, that it forbid every &s;in, the lea&s;t as well as the greate&s;t: and that it therefore required nothing but holine&s;s. And that therefore his unholy grace|le&s;s covenant was not required by it, or contained in it.</P>
<P N="2">2 IT will on the other hand be readily granted by us, that
<PB N="29" REF="011174_0023_0F857FF4B89C7650">
the law of God (con&s;idered, as requiring prefect holine&s;s, and forbidding every &s;in, the lea&s;t as well as the greate&s;t) is the rule of life to believers; and as &s;uch, is pre&s;uppo&s;ed and implied in the covenant of grace, which is not de&s;ign|ed to <HI>make void, but to e&s;tabli&s;h the Law.</HI> Rom. 3.31. And therefore whenever the covenant of grace is complied with in the exerci&s;e of faith, the law, in the very act, is cordially received as a rule of life by the believer: even as Abraham received that divine injunction, <HI>walk before me and be thou perfect,</HI> in the very act of his renewing covenant with God. Gen. 17. &mdash;But I have endeavoured already to explain and prove this at large in <HI>an e&s;&s;ay on the nature and glory of the go&s;pel.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. NONE can con&s;i&s;tently pretend, that Mo&s;es intended to lead the I&s;raelites to profe&s;s &s;inle&s;s perfection in that cove|nant; becau&s;e the daily &s;acrifice of a lamb, the great type of the Lamb of God which takes away the &s;ins of the world, which was to be offered, morning and evening continually, as well as a great variety of others &s;acrifices of atonement, were a&s;&s;ential parts of the Sinai covenant. But the&s;e had been needle&s;s in&s;titutions, had perfect holine&s;s been profe&s;&s;edly expected. For it was profe&s;&s;edly expected that they would keep covenant. For they were taken into covenant in that view. I&s;a. 63.8. <HI>For he &s;aid, &s;urely they are my people, children that will not lie.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. AND yet no fact can be plainer than that Mo&s;es led them to receive the whole law for the rule of their lives, and that they profe&s;&s;ed to do this. Exod, 24.3. <HI>And Mo&s;es came and told the people all the words of the Lord, and all the judg|ments: and all the people an&s;wered with one voice, and &s;aid, all the words, which the Lord hath &s;aid, will we do:</HI> Compared with Deut. 26.17. <HI>Thou ha&s;t avouched the Lord this day to be thy God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his &s;tatutes and his commandments, and his judgments, and to hearken unto his voice.</HI> For they profe&s;&s;ed, not merely to give the <HI>a&s;&s;ent of their under|&s;tandings</HI> to this truth, viz. That the law of God ought to be the rule of their lives; but, to u&s;e the modern phra&s;e, they profe&s;&s;ed the <HI>con&s;ent of their wills:</HI> "All the words which the Lord hath &s;poken, <HI>will we do.</HI>" And God declares that
<PB N="30" REF="011174_0024_0F857FF51AEE0B00">
this was "well &s;aid." And had there been "&s;uch an heart in them" an&s;werable to their vi&s;ible profe&s;&s;on, they would have been <HI>I&s;raelites indeed:</HI> for <HI>their hearts would</HI> then have <HI>been right in the &s;ight of God,</HI> and they would have been <HI>&s;tead|fa&s;t in his covenant.</HI> Num. 32.11, 12. Their profe&s;&s;ion therefore was full enough, but <HI>they lied to God will their tongues.</HI> Their profe&s;&s;ion was as full as God de&s;ired: but there was not <HI>&s;uch an heart in them.</HI> P&s;al. 78.36, 37. For,</P>
<P N="5">5. It is the peculiar character of the regenerate cordially to receive the divine law as the rule of their lives. Heb. 8.10. But it is the univer&s;al character of the unregenerate to be in a &s;tate of total contrariety to the divine law in their hearts. Rom. 8.7. <HI>Becau&s;e the carnal mind is enmity again&s;t God: for it is not &s;ubject to his law; neither indeed can be.</HI> Therefore,</P>
<P N="6">6. As every true believer does cordially receive the law of God for the rule of his life, &s;o he may under&s;tandingly and hone&s;tly profe&s;s it: but one who&s;e heart is in a &s;tate of total contrariety to the divine law, if he under&s;tands and ho|ne&s;tly &s;peaks the truth, mu&s;t &s;ay, <Q>I am not &s;ubject to the divine law, neither indeed can I be; yea, &s;o far from it, that I am at enmity again&s;t God.</Q> But,</P>
<P N="7">7. None of the religious &s;eekings and endeavours of one, in whom a total non-compliance with God's holy cove|nant takes place, are of the nature of a compliance with that covenant, in the lea&s;t degree; as is &s;elf-evident. For to &s;ay otherwi&s;e, is an expre&s;s contradiction. Therefore,</P>
<P N="8">8. THERE is no way left for a profe&s;&s;ion of a compliance with God's holy covenant, to tho&s;e who know them&s;elves to be unconverted, (without lying) but to deny the doctrine of total depravity. For &s;ince the covenant cannot be proved to be an unholy gracele&s;s one, we mu&s;t pretend that grace|le&s;s &s;inners have &s;ome grace, in order to obtain our end. But,</P>
<P N="9">9. IF unconverted &s;inners have that grace, which is a compliance with the covenant of grace, then they are en|titled to the ble&s;&s;ings of the covenant of grace, to pardon, ju&s;tification and eternal life; which to &s;ay, is at once to &s;et a&s;ide the whole New-Te&s;tament. Thus &s;tands the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Now what method Mr. M. will take, to get along with
<PB N="31" REF="011174_0024_0F857FF51AEE0B00">
his &s;cheme, after time for recon&s;ideration, is not yet known: or whether a gentlemen of &s;o much good &s;en&s;e will not ra|ther give it up.</P>
<P>OBJECT. But if the&s;e things are true, it will follow, that the covenant with Abraham, the Sinai covenant, and the go&s;pel covenant are for &s;ub&s;tance, one and the &s;ame cove|nant; even the covenant of grace: but this does not agree with many &s;cripture texts. For the Apo&s;tle Paul di&s;tingui&s;h|es between the Abrahamic covenant and the Sinai covenant, between the <HI>promi&s;e to Abraham</HI> and <HI>the law which was</HI> 430 <HI>years after,</HI> and calls them <HI>two covenants.</HI> Gal. 3.16, 17, 18, and Chap. 4.24. And he repre&s;ents the Sinai covenant, which he calls <HI>the law</HI> as requiring perfect obedience on pain of the cur&s;e. Chap. 3.10. And affirms that by the <HI>deeds of the law no fle&s;h can be ju&s;tified.</HI> Rom. 3.20. Gal. 2.16. And that Abraham was <HI>not ju&s;tified by the law, but by faith.</HI> Gal. 3.6, 7, 8, 9. And that the <HI>law is not of faith.</HI> Ver. 12. but a <HI>School-Ma&s;ter to bring us to Chri&s;t, that we might be ju&s;tified by faith.</HI> Ver. 24 Moreover, it is plainly intimated, that in the Sinai covenant God did not communicate &s;anctifying grace to tho&s;e that were under it; but that in the go&s;pel covenant he does. At mount Sinai God <HI>wrote the law on ta|bles of &s;tone,</HI> and obliged the people to keep it: but did not give them a heart to do &s;o: but in the new covenant God <HI>writes his law on the heart.</HI> i. e. by the influences of his &s;pirit gives a di&s;po&s;ition of mind an&s;werable to the law. Heb. 8.8&mdash;12. Therefore Paul calls the Sinai covenant the <HI>mini&s;|tration of death</HI> and <HI>condemnation,</HI> and the <HI>letter</HI> that <HI>killeth</HI> in di&s;tinction from the go&s;pel, which he calls the <HI>&s;pirit</HI> which <HI>giveth life,</HI> the <HI>mini&s;tration of the &s;pirit,</HI> and the <HI>mini&s;tration of righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> 2 Cor. 3.6, 7, 8.</P>
<P>ANSW. As Mr. M. maintains that the Abrahamic, the Sinai, and the Go&s;pel covenants are for &s;ub&s;tance one and the &s;ame covenant; &s;o the foregoing objection cannot con|&s;i&s;tently be made by him or by his admirers; nor has he taken any notice of it. It may &s;uffice therefore to &s;ay;</P>
<P N="1">1. That every &s;elf-righteous Jew was di&s;po&s;ed to con&s;i|der the Old-Te&s;tament as a covenant of works, and every
<PB N="32" REF="011174_0025_0F857FF8117A1F00">
&s;elf-righteous chri&s;tian is di&s;po&s;ed to con&s;ider the New Te&s;|tament in the &s;ame light. They attended the externals of that di&s;pen&s;ation and expected to find acceptance with God, by what they did. Luk. 18.11. Rom. 9.31.32. And their example is clo&s;ely followed by too many under the chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation: neither of them under&s;tanding the true nature of the divine law. Rom. 7.8, 9.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is readily granted, that St. Paul taught, that all &s;elf-righteous &s;inners, be they Jews or Chri&s;tians, are under a law which requires perfect obedience on pain of eternal damnation: that this law is holy, ju&s;t and good; that they are in duty bound to fulfil this law them&s;elves; that GOD is not bound to give them any a&s;&s;i&s;tance at all; and that it cur&s;es every one that continueth not in all things. And it is readily granted, that this law is a mini&s;tration of death and condemnation, and killeth. It was <HI>ordained to life,</HI> i. e. it promi&s;es life to every one that lives up to it; but it is <HI>found to be unto death</HI> to every one who makes the attempt. Rom. 7.10.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is readily granted, that this law is as different from the Abrahamic covenant, and the go&s;pel covenant, as the covenant of works is from the covenant of grace: And that it was the de&s;ign of the apo&s;tle to &s;et this difference in a clear and &s;triking light, that he might kill all the &s;elf-righteous hopes of the &s;elf-righteous &s;inner; and convince him that there is no hope in his ca&s;e, but of mere free grace thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Gal. 3.10, 24. Rom. 3.9&mdash;25.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is al&s;o granted, that this law was one principal part of the Sinai covenant: and that every carnal Jew was un|der it, and held bound by it: Yea, that it is the peculiar privilege of the true believer to be delivered from it, and that by being united to and intere&s;ted in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, the &s;econd Adam, who hath completely an&s;wered it's demands; Rom. 6.14, and chap. 7.4, 5, 6. Gal. 2.19, 20. and chap. 3.10&mdash;14.&mdash;And to grant the&s;e things is to grant all that the Apo&s;tle &s;ays about this law. And yet con&s;i&s;tently with all the&s;e things it may be a&s;&s;erted, that</P>
<P N="5">5. The Mo&s;aic di&s;pen&s;ation did reveal a way in which
<PB N="33" REF="011174_0025_0F857FF8117A1F00">
pardon of &s;in might be obtained: it did exhibit in types a &s;hadow of the go&s;pel way of obtaining pardon. See the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 16th chapters of <HI>Leviticus.</HI> And it did promi&s;e pardoning mercy and &s;anctifying grace to the pe|nitent believer. Lev. 26.40, 41, 42. Deut. 30.1&mdash;6. And the land of Canaan was a de&s;igned type of heaven; &amp; long life and pro&s;perity there, of eternal life and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s above. Heb. 4.1&mdash;11.&mdash;But this is the &s;um of what is intended, when the Sinai covenant is repre&s;ented as a cove|nant of grace.</P>
<P N="6">6. The I&s;raelites when they entered into covenant at Mount-Sinai in words, did by their unbelief reject the co|venant of grace in their hearts. P&s;al. 78.36, 37. Heb. 3.19. And therefore notwith&s;tanding they were then vi&s;ibly mar|ried to GOD in a covenant containing the promi&s;es before mentioned, whereby they laid them&s;elves under bonds to keep covenant; yet GOD was not obliged to give them a heart to keep covenant, by any promi&s;e contained in that di&s;pen&s;ation, as he would have been had they been &s;incere, and as he is to all who are united to Chri&s;t by a true and living faith. And &s;o it came to pa&s;s that they broke cove|nant, in an open, public manner; and <HI>he regarded them not,</HI> but their carca&s;es fell in the wilderne&s;s: Whereas GOD <HI>writes his law in the heart</HI> of the true believer, and effectual|ly inclines him to walk in his ways. And thus every fal&s;e profe&s;&s;or, whether Jew or Chri&s;tian, will fall &s;hort of the heavenly Canaan; as it is written, Joh. 15.2. <HI>Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit.</HI>&mdash;But,</P>
<P N="7">7. If any, after all, &s;hall in&s;i&s;t, that the Sinai covenant was merely a covenant of works, and that the Abrahamic covenant was not in any &s;en&s;e contained in it, they ought to con&s;ider, that if this be &s;o, then the Sinai covenant ought to be entirely left out of the account in the pre&s;ent di&s;pute, &amp; circumci&s;ion ought to be con&s;idered, as being in no &s;en&s;e a &s;eal of it. For it was appointed to be a &s;eal of the Abrahamic covenant, and of no other; and therefore if the Abraha|mic

covenant was in no &s;en&s;e a part of the Sinai covenant, then circumci&s;ion, was in no &s;en&s;e a &s;eal of the Sinai covenant. For no new &s;eals to the covenant of works have been ap|pointed &s;ince Adam was turned out of paradi&s;e. And as for Mr. M.'s external gracele&s;s covenant, it never had any exi&s;tence. The bible knows nothing about it, either name or thing.&mdash;We have already &s;een that it is not contained in the Old-Te&s;tament, and we &s;hall pre&s;ently perceive, that it is not to be found in the new.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECT. IV.</HI> The Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t e&s;&s;entially different from Mr. Mather's ex|ternal, gracele&s;s covenant.</HEAD>
<P>IT is true, the go&s;pel con&s;i&s;ts in an external revelation; but then the thing revealed, is the way of &s;alvation by free grace thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t. It is al&s;o true, that the call of the go&s;pel is an external call; but then the thing it calls us unto, is a belief and compliance with the way of &s;alvati|on by free-grace thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The go&s;pel con&s;i&s;ts in the cleare&s;t and fulle&s;t external revelation of the way in which GOD may be ju&s;t and yet ju&s;tify and &s;ave &s;inners; which way of &s;alvation it con&s;tantly invites &s;inners to com|ply with, that they may be pardoned and &s;aved; &s;aying, <HI>come, for all things are now ready.</HI> Mat. 22.4. This may be called an external covenant, as it is a vi&s;ible exhibition of the covenant of grace, with which profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tiani|ty vi&s;ibly comply in a profe&s;&s;ion of repentance toward GOD and faith toward our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. But in this view, it is e&s;&s;entially different from Mr. M.'s external covenant. For the go&s;pel covenant promi&s;es pardon and eternal life to tho&s;e who really comply with it; but one may com|ply with Mr. M.'s external covenant in &s;incerity and truth&punc; and yet have no grace and finally peri&s;h. For Mr. M.'s external covenant does not require &s;aving grace, and may be perfectly complied with by one who is dead in &s;in. For it is an unholy, gracele&s;s covenant; and &s;o it is e&s;&s;entially different from the go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>JOHN Bapti&s;t did not baptize with the bapti&s;m of the external covenant, but with the <HI>bapti&s;m of repentance for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins.</HI> Luke 3.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="011174_0026_0F857FF82E3F8DC8">JESUS CHRIST did not call men to comply with an ex|ternal gracele&s;s covenant, and be bapti&s;ed: But to <HI>repent &amp; believe the go&s;pel.</HI> Mat. 1.15.

He warned his hearers again&s;t profe&s;&s;ing and not living up to his religion, as an incon&s;i&s;tent conduct. Luk. 6.46. He called them to make &s;uch a profe&s;&s;ion, as he might own to their honor in the heavenly world, before his Father. Mat. 10.32. <HI>Who|&s;oever &s;hall confe&s;s me before men, him will I confe&s;s al&s;o before my Father which is in heaven.</HI> This is that profe&s;&s;ion unto which he invited men, and never invited them to any other. Rather to fal&s;e profe&s;&s;ors Chri&s;t declares it will be &s;aid, <HI>Friend, how came&s;t thou in hither, not having on a wedding gar|ment?</HI> Mat. 22.</P>
<P>THE apo&s;tles had no commi&s;&s;ion to preach and baptize upon Mr. M.'s external covenant; but were expre&s;sly or|dered to <HI>preach the go&s;pel to every creature;</HI> a go&s;pel that pro|mi&s;ed eternal life: and to baptize tho&s;e who appeared to comply with it. Mark 16.15, 16. They were &s;ent to make di&s;ciples, not to Mr. M.'s external covenant, but to Chri&s;tia|nity. Mat. 28.19, 20. In a word, they were &s;ent to <HI>preach repentance and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins to all nations in the name of Chri&s;t.</HI> Luk. 24.47. And they acted up to their commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>When the <HI>three thou&s;and were pricked in their heart,</HI> Peter did not tell them to comply with Mr. M.'s external cove|nant and be bapti&s;ed, which they might have done, and yet have continued impenitent and unpardoned; but, exactly according to his Ma&s;ter's orders, he &s;aid, <HI>repent and be bap|ti&s;ed in the name of the Lord Je&s;us for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins.</HI> Acts 2.37, 38. Repent fir&s;t, and then be bapti&s;ed.</P>
<P>And when Peter went to preach to Cornelius, it was not to preach up an external covenant, with which a man may comply and yet peri&s;h; but to declare to him the go&s;pel way of &s;alvation, to <HI>tell him words whereby he might be &s;aved,

and all his hou&s;e.</HI> Acts 11.14. And accordingly, he preach|ed the go&s;pel, viz. <HI>That thro' Chri&s;t's name, who&s;oever be|lieveth in him &s;hall receive remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins.</HI> Acts 10.43. But he &s;aid not one word about Mr. M.'s external gracele&s;s cove|nant. And when the church at Jeru&s;alem heard what had happened, they <HI>glorified God,</HI> not that the Gentiles were ad|mitted into an external gracele&s;s covenant, a thing not heard of in the apo&s;tolic age; but they glorified GOD, &s;aying, <HI>then hath God al&s;o to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.</HI> Acts 11.18. For it had been their notion, that an uncir|cumci&s;ed Gentile could not be &s;aved. Acts 15.1.</P>
<P>PETER, before he began his &s;ermon, was well a&s;&s;ured that Cornelius was a real &s;aint; for Cornelius had known &s;o much about the Jewi&s;h religion, that altho' born a Pa|gan, yet he had renounced idolatry, and had become a true and acceptable wor&s;hipper of the GOD of I&s;rael. He was a believer in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e that Nathanael was, who was <HI>an I&s;raelite indeed in whom there was no guile,</HI> and who however did not at that time know that Je&s;us was the Me&s;&s;iah who was to come. John 1.43&mdash;47. For <HI>without faith it is im|po&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God.</HI> Heb. 11.6. But Cornelius <HI>obtained witne&s;s that he was righteous, God te&s;tifying of his gifts,</HI> by an angel from heaven, which appeared to him. Acts 10.4. And by a vi&s;ion which appeared to Peter, and a voice de|claring Cornelius, tho' uncircumci&s;ed, yet in the &s;ight of GOD to be <HI>not unclean,</HI> but <HI>clean;</HI> for that GOD him&s;elf had <HI>clean&s;ed him;</HI> ver. 9&mdash;16. Peter therefore began his &s;ermon with a declaration, that Cornelius, altho' uncircumci&s;ed, was neverthele&s;s in a &s;tate of acceptance with GOD; ver. 34, 35. It had been mad work therefore now for Peter to preach up Mr. M.'s external gracele&s;s covenant to one, who was already really in the covenant of grace, and whom Pe|ter had ju&s;t declared to be &s;o. But, Peter, far from this, knowing his bu&s;ine&s;s well, gave to him and to the whole company a brief narrative of the life, death and re&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; exhibiting the evidence there was, that he was indeed the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah, and that <HI>through his name who&s;oever believeth in him, &s;hall receive the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins.</HI> Ver.

36&mdash; 43. And it happened to the hearers, while he was preaching, as Chri&s;t &s;aid it would to them that believe, even in the very commi&s;&s;ion which he gave to his apo&s;tles. (Mark 16.15, 16.) <HI>The Holy Gho&s;t fell on all them that heard the word.</HI> And that not only in his extraordinary gifts, but al&s;o in his &s;anctifying influences, and that to a great degree; for they not only "&s;pake with tongues," but "MAGNIFI|ED GOD;" as the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin did, when filled with the Holy Gho&s;t, Luke 1.46. Or rather, as tho&s;e, who, on the day of Penteco&s;t, <HI>&s;pake the wonderful works of God.</HI> Acts 2.11.&mdash;This appearance &s;truck Peter and all the &s;aints pre|&s;ent with a&s;toni&s;hment. <HI>Can any man forbid water, that the&s;e &s;hould not be baptized, which have received the Holy Gho&s;t, as well as we?</HI> &s;aid Peter. And exactly in this point of light did Peter afterwards &s;et this fact, when he gave a narrative of it to the council at Jeru&s;alem. Acts 15.8, 9. <HI>And God which knoweth the hearts, beareth them witne&s;s, giving them the Holy Gho&s;t, even as he did unto us, and put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.</HI>&mdash;And again,</P>
<P>When Paul had the awakened jailor to in&s;truct, and to prepare for bapti&s;m, he &s;aid not one word to him, about Mr. M.'s external covenant, either name or thing; but preached the go&s;pel to him, &s;aying, <HI>believe on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and thou &s;halt be &s;aved, and thy hou&s;e.</HI> Acts 16.30, 31. And thou &s;hall be "&s;aved." He did not preach up an un|&s;aving, gracele&s;s faith, the faith of devils: but a &s;aving faith. To that, and to no other, did he exhort the jailor, in order to prepare him for bapti&s;m. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">It is not looked upon, among men, ingenuous, fair and hone&s;t to lead any to &s;ign and &s;eal a bond, before we let them know the contents of it. But the apo&s;tles led their converts to &s;et to their &s;eal in bapti&s;m, with|out &s;aying one word to them about Mr M.'s external covenant, name or thing. This, therefore, was not the covenant which they led them to &s;eal. Nay, the apo&s;tles them&s;elves do not appear to have known, that there was any &s;uch covenant to be preached up by them, or to be &s;ealed by their converts.</NOTE></P>
<P>When Mr. Sandeman &s;ays, that "a &s;imple belief of the &s;imple truth," (<HI>the heart</HI> left out of the account) is &s;aving faith; Mr. M. will doubtle&s;s agree with me in &s;aying, "This
<PB N="38" REF="011174_0028_0F857FF9B82E6688">
cannot be &s;aving faith; becau&s;e the devil has it." When therefore Mr. Mather (p. 25) repre&s;ents the eunuch, as entering into covenant with GOD, by the &s;imple belief of the &s;imple truth, by an ungracious, unholy faith, and is re&s;olv|ed to make that phra&s;e, "with all thine heart," &s;tand for nothing; I beg leave to reply, "this faith cannot bring tho&s;e into covenant with GOD that have it; becau&s;e the devil has it." And I humbly conceive that no man need be at a lo&s;s about the meaning of Philip's words, or of the eunuch's an&s;wer, that will compare them with Rom. 10.9. "If thou &s;halt confe&s;s with thy mouth the Lord Je&s;us, and &s;halt believe in thine heart, that GOD hath rai&s;ed him from the dead, THOU SHALT BE SAVED." And with 1 John 4.15. "Who&s;oever &s;hall confe&s;s that Je&s;us is the Son of GOD, GOD dwelleth in him, and he in GOD." And chap. 5.1. "Who&s;oever believeth that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t, is born of God." For ju&s;t this was the profe&s;&s;ion which Philip de|manded, and which the eunuch made.</P>
<P>And in this view of things, it is ea&s;y to di&s;cern the true rea&s;on, why the apo&s;tolic churches, were, in the epi&s;tles wrote to them, con&s;idered and treated as <HI>&s;aints,</HI> by the wri|ters, who it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed had any per&s;onal acquain|tance at all with many of them; and why they were &s;po|ken of as <HI>beloved of God,</HI> Rom. 1.7. <HI>Sanctified in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> 1 Cor. 1.2. <HI>Cho&s;en in Chri&s;t before the foundation of the world.</HI> Eph. 1.4. &amp;c. &amp;c. For &s;uch they were by profe&s;&s;ion be|fore all the world; and &s;uch generally &s;peaking they proved them&s;elves to be by their practice. Indeed it was always expected, that tares would, more or le&s;s be among the wheat. But the apo&s;tles did not think it their duty to &s;ow tares knowingly and on de&s;ign, as Mr. M. would have us do. In that age of the church this was thought to be the work of the devil. Mat. 13.39. And, methinks, he may, now in our age, do enough at it, without any help from the clergy.&mdash;And if profe&s;&s;ors in that age lived up to their profe&s;&s;ion, and gave abundant evidence of their &s;incerity, by the holine&s;s of their lives, as Mr. M. ob&s;erves they did. P. 31, &amp;c. Then they were indeed <HI>the &s;alt of the earth,</HI> and
<PB N="39" REF="011174_0028_0F857FF9B82E6688">
<HI>the light of the world,</HI> in their profe&s;&s;ion and in their practice too, as all church members ought to be. Mat. 5.13, 14, 15. Nor did the apo&s;tles think it a thing of dangerous tenden|cy to treat them as &s;uch in the mo&s;t public manner, in the &s;ight of the world; as Mr. M. mu&s;t have thought on his &s;cheme, p. 51, &amp;c. The&s;e were churches of <HI>vi&s;ible &s;aints,</HI> who appeared to be the <HI>body of Chri&s;t,</HI> a <HI>living body</HI> to a <HI>living head.</HI> P. 48, 49. And not <HI>&s;ynagogues of &s;atan,</HI> to which gracele&s;s profe&s;&s;ors are &s;aid to belong, in Rev. 2.9.&mdash;To conclude,</P>
<P>When we read the life of John Bapti&s;t, and of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; when we read the commi&s;&s;ion given to the apo&s;tles, in Mathew, Mark, and Luke; and when we read the hi&s;|tory of their conduct in the Acts; and con&s;ider how they treated the churches which they &s;et up; nothing can be plainer, than that they preached the go&s;pel, made pro&s;elytes to Chri&s;tianity, &s;et up Chri&s;tian churches, on the go&s;pel plan; and not on the plan of an external gracele&s;s covenant, a thing not heard of in that age.</P>
<P>Obj. But there was not time to examine the three thou|&s;and on the day of Penteco&s;t, in order to form a judgment of their gracious &s;tate: nor to judge of them by their fruits. P. 26.</P>
<P>An&s;. They profe&s;&s;ed to comply with Peter's exhortation, <HI>repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Je&s;us for the re|mi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins.</HI> Their profe&s;&s;ion, circum&s;tanced as it was, was to all appearance &s;incere. And this was enough; for the doctrine of the nece&s;&s;ity of an infallible certainty that pro|fe&s;&s;ors were what they profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to be, in order to their admi&s;&s;ion into the church, was not an apo&s;tolic doctrine. And be&s;ides, they had as much time to examine into their grace, as into their moral &s;incerity.</P>
<P>Obj. <Q>How could the character of the apo&s;tles be main|tained as infallibly in&s;pired guides to the church, when tho&s;e they had received, did &s;o often prove hypo|crites, fal&s;e-brethren and apo&s;tates?</Q> P. 29.</P>

pretended to do it them&s;elves. They preached repentance toward GOD and faith toward our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t: Their converts profe&s;&s;ed that repentance and faith which they preached: They received them upon their profe&s;&s;ion; they expected there would be tares among the wheat. But they did not mean to &s;ow tares knowingly and upon de&s;ign: this was the work of the devil; and is it not fit that the mini|&s;ters of Chri&s;t &s;hould take the work of the devil out of his hands.</P>
<P>Obj. It is true, Peter &s;aid of Cornelius and tho&s;e that were with him, <HI>God put no difference between us and them, pu|rifying their hearts by faith.</HI> But he &s;aid this &s;ome years af|ter, in which time they had doubtle&s;s given &s;ufficient evi|dence: but this is of no weight, to prove that they were ad|mitted to bapti&s;m on that &s;uppo&s;ition. P. 28.</P>
<P>An&s;. If he did &s;ay this &s;ome years after, and if they had in that time given ever &s;o great evidence of the &s;incerity of their conver&s;ion; yet Peter &s;ays not one word about this con&s;equent evidence, nor gives the lea&s;t hint that they had given &s;uch evidence. He mentions not one &s;ingle fact, on which his charity for them was founded, but that only which happened before they were baptized, viz. <HI>Giving them the Holy Gho&s;t even as he did unto us.</HI> But the Apo&s;tles received not only the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t on the day of penteco&s;t, but al&s;o large effu&s;ions of his &s;anctifying influences, filling their hearts with love to divine things: And out of the abundance of their hearts, their mouths &s;pake of <HI>the wonderful works of God.</HI> Acts 2.11. And it hap|pened to Cornelius and his hou&s;hould ju&s;t as it had to the Apo&s;tles on the day of penteco&s;t, and their hearts were fil|led with divine Love; and out of the abundance of their hearts their mouth &s;pake, MAGNIFYING GOD, extolling and prai&s;ing him for the glorious di&s;play of his perfections in the work of redemption by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Acts 10.46. By which Peter and the &s;aints who were with him perceived to their full &s;atisfaction, that the&s;e Gentile converts had the &s;ame holy views, and holy affections, which they them&s;elves had; which led Peter to &s;ay, <HI>God bare them witne&s;s, giving them

<P>MR. Mather &s;ays, p. 36, <Q>Seals are rites of confir|mation.&mdash;Nothing is confirmed by the &s;eal, but what is expre&s;&s;ed in the written in&s;trument to which it is annexed.

"The&s;e &s;eals with re&s;pect to us, confirm the profe&s;&s;ion which we make, and the engagements we come under." So that if the written in&s;trument</Q> is the covenant of grace; GOD, by affixing his &s;eal, ratifies his promi&s;e to &s;ave tho&s;e that com|ply with it; and this on God's part, is the import of the action of &s;ealing. And, if the "written in&s;trument" is the covenant of of grace; the profe&s;&s;or, by actively receiving the &s;eal, declares, on his part, that he does comply with that covenant, and ratifies his engagements to live up to it. For, thus it is, in all mutual covenants among men, where both parties &s;eal; they do, by &s;ealing, declare a pre&s;ent compliance with the bargain and mutually oblige them&s;elves to act up to it for the future. To the bargain, I &s;ay, as contained in the written in&s;trument; to that, and to no|thing el&s;e. So that when once it is determined what is con|tained in the written in&s;trument; it is at the &s;ame time de|termined, what is &s;ealed, and what is the import of the act of &s;ealing. But Mr. M. &s;ays, "The &s;ealing ordinances; by which the external covenant is &s;ealed and confirmed, do equally &s;eal and confirm the the covenant of grace." P. 36.

It will al&s;o follow from Mr. M.'s own words, that when (a Godly man) Abraham, for in&s;tance, &s;ealed the external covenant, and the covenant of grace both at once, he e|qually bound him&s;elf all his life long to perform all religi|ous duties, both in a gracious and ungracious manner, at the &s;ame time. But how could Abraham, at the &s;ame time, &s;erve the&s;e two contrary ma&s;ters, requiring things as contra|ry as &s;in and holine&s;s? Or how could he, being a Godly man, with a good con&s;cience, bind him&s;elf by covenant to perform all religious duties in an unholy manner? Surely he could not do it! and &s;o on Mr. M.'s plan, the door of the vi&s;ible church is &s;hut again&s;t both the Godly and the wicked. The Godly cannot come to &s;acraments, be|cau&s;e they are &s;eals of an unholy covenant, binding them to live in a cour&s;e of unholy duties; and the ungodly, knowing them&s;elves to be &s;uch, cannot come, becau&s;e they are &s;eals of a holy covenant, binding them to live in a cour&s;e of holy duties. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. M. thinks, that there "was a manife&s;t propriety in choo&s;ing Abraham, a man of eminent holine&s;s," to be at the head of this grace|le&s;s covenant, p. 9.&mdash;But I am of our Saviour's mind, Mat. 12.33. <HI>Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or el&s;e make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt.</HI> Let holy Abraham be at the head of a holy covenant; but let &s;ome gracele&s;s profe&s;&s;or, be at the head of Mr. M.'s external gracele&s;s covenant. For it was contrary to the Jewi&s;h law <HI>to yoke an ox and an a&s;s together.</HI> And &s;aith the apo&s;tle, Paul, <HI>What fellow&s;hip hath righteou&s;ne&s;s with unrighteou&s;ne&s;s?</HI> 2 Cor. 6.14.</NOTE> Therefore,</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="43" REF="011174_0030_0F857FFB3B409FF8">3. Mr. M. mu&s;t give up the common notion of a &s;eal, as de|claring a pre&s;ent compliance with, &amp; binding both parties to act up to what is contained in the written in&s;trument, or el&s;e he mu&s;t hone&s;tly leave the covenant of grace out of the written in&s;trument, or he mu&s;t give up his &s;cheme as wholly incon|&s;i&s;tent.&mdash;To &s;olve this difficulty he &s;ays, "In their primary re|ference they may be &s;eals of the external covenant; and yet, con&s;i&s;tently, in their ultimate reference, may be &s;eals of the covenant of grace." P. 36.&mdash;But if they, in fact, really &s;eal both covenants, then the man who comes to the &s;acraments, does, in fact, really bind him&s;elf to fulfil both covenants. For, let him a&s;k any lawyer on the con|tinent, and he will be told, that by &s;ealing a "written in|&s;trument," if it contains two or ten covenants, we oblige our&s;elves, either to fulfil all of them, or none of them.&mdash; The truth is, Mr. M. had propo&s;ed this objection again&s;t his &s;cheme, viz. <Q>The preceeding di&s;cour&s;e repre&s;ents the &s;ealing ordinances of the go&s;pel, not as &s;eals of the cove|nant of grace, but of the external covenant with the vi|&s;ible church.</Q> And he had no way to get rid of it, ac|cording to his &s;cheme, but to run into the&s;e incon&s;i&s;tences, or roundly to deny the received doctrine of the Chri&s;tian church, that bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper, are &s;eals of the covenant of grace. He has denied it implicitly: but he did not choo&s;e to deny it expre&s;sly; but &s;eems to own it; and &s;o runs him&s;elf into the&s;e incon&s;i&s;tences.</P>
<P>But if we turn our eyes off from Mr. M.'s incon&s;i&s;tent &s;cheme, to the New-Te&s;tament, which was de&s;ignedly a|dapted to the capacities of common people, we &s;hall &s;ee not the lea&s;t appearance of two covenants of which bapti&s;m and the Lord's-&s;upper are the appointed &s;eals; we &s;hall find no covenant but the covenant of grace; no go&s;pel, but the go&s;|pel

of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which promi&s;es pardon and eternal &s;al|vation to the penitent believer; and bapti&s;m &amp; the Lord's-&s;upper are repre&s;ented as &s;eals to no other covenant but this.&mdash;For, to u&s;e Mr. M.'s phra&s;e,</P>
<P>In the "written in&s;trument" GOD promi&s;es &s;alvation to the true believer. Mark 16.16. Therefore, <HI>if thou believe&s;t with all thine heart, thou maye&s;t</HI> be active in receiving the &s;eal of the covenant, &s;aid Philip, divinely in&s;pired. Acts 8.37.</P>
<P>Again. In the "written in&s;trument" GOD promi&s;es re|mi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins to the true penitent thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t, Luke 24.47. Therefore, <HI>repent and be bapti&s;ed in the name of the Lord Je&s;us for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins,</HI> Acts 2.38. (that is, com|ply with the covenant, and then be active in receiving the &s;eal;) was the language of a divinely in&s;pired apo&s;tle.&mdash;And, another divinely in&s;pired mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, already know|ing the man to be a true penitent, and &s;o prepared to be active in receiving the &s;eal of the covenant, &s;aid, <HI>ari&s;e, and be bapti&s;ed, and wa&s;h away thy &s;ins, calling on the name of the Lord.</HI> Acts 22.16.&mdash;Thus we &s;ee what covenant is rati|fied and confirmed by this &s;eal, on GOD'S part.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e the apo&s;tolic profe&s;&s;ors, in offering them|&s;elves to bapti&s;m, and in being active in receiving the &s;eal of the covenant, did, on their parts, thereby bind them&s;elves to live according to all things contained in it, therefore Paul &s;aid, Gal. 3.27. <HI>As many of you as have been bapti&s;ed into Chri&s;t, have put on Chri&s;t;</HI> not <HI>put on the external covenant;</HI> but <HI>put on Chri&s;t.</HI> i. e. put on Chri&s;tianity: So as to be entituled to the heavenly Canaan, granting their hearts to an&s;wer to their external conduct; for, he adds, ver. 29. <HI>And if ye are Chri&s;t's, then are ye Abraham's &s;eed, and heirs, ac|cording to promi&s;e.</HI> Heirs to what? To all the ble&s;&s;ings of the covenant; particularly, to the heavenly Canaan, of which the earthly Canaan was a type, and which Paul had ju&s;t &s;aid, was given to Abraham by promi&s;e, ver. 18.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e in bapti&s;m, in the apo&s;tolic age, men pro|fe&s;&s;ed a cordial compliance with the covenant of grace, &amp; bound them&s;elves in all things to be affected and act ac|cordingly; therefore, when it was objected, that Paul's
<PB N="45" REF="011174_0031_0F857FFBFAB6C300">
doctrine of ju&s;tification by faith, without works, tended to make men licentious, and to encourage them to live in &s;in, that grace might abound; he thought it &s;ufficient to &s;ay, "This can never be, for we have been baptized, and &s;o we are dead to &s;in and alive to GOD." <HI>Shall we continue in &s;in, that grace may abound? God forbid. How &s;hall we that are dead to &s;in live any longer therein? Know ye not, that &s;o many of us as were baptized into Je&s;us Chri&s;t, were baptized into his death? therefore we are buried with him by bapti&s;m into death: that like as Chri&s;t was rai&s;ed up from the dead by the glory of the Fa|ther, even &s;o we al&s;o &s;hould walk in newne&s;s of life; for if we have been</HI> (in bapti&s;m) <HI>planted together in the likene&s;s of his death: we &s;hall be al&s;o in the likene&s;s of his re&s;urrection.&mdash;For &s;in &s;hall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under law, but under grace.</HI> Rom. 6.1&mdash;14. Which proves, that in bapti&s;m they profe&s;&s;ed a compliance with Chri&s;tianity it&s;elf, and not with Mr. M.'s external gracele&s;s covenant, with which a man may comply, while under the dominion of &s;in.</P>
<P>And, indeed, for men to come to the apo&s;tles to be bap|ti&s;ed <HI>in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> could, con&s;i&s;tently, mean nothing le&s;s than a public practical declaration of a pre&s;ent compliance with what the go&s;pel reveals concerning the Father, the Son, and the Ho|ly Gho&s;t; and an engagement to act accordingly in all future time: in which the whole of Chri&s;tianity con&s;i&s;ts. To be|lieve what the go&s;pel reveals concerning the Father, Son and Holy Gho&s;t; and to receive God for our Father, and Chri&s;t for our Mediator, and the Holy Gho&s;t for our Enlightener and Sanctifier; and to be affected and act accordingly, is the whole of Chri&s;tianity. But to be active in offering our &s;elves to be bapti&s;ed in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t; and in the very act, to refu&s;e in our hearts, &amp; in the &s;ight of GOD, to have God for our Father, or Chri&s;t for our Saviour, or the Holy Gho&s;t for our Sanctifier, is to contradict our&s;elves, in the &s;ight of GOD. It is, to lie to the Holy Gho&s;t. It is to renounce Chri&s;tianity in heart, at the very moment when we embrace it in our vi&s;ible conduct.

Not &s;o much as to get free from the do|minion of &s;in. For this is peculiar to the godly. Rom. 6.14. How much then? No &s;on of Adam can ever tell!</P>
<P>IT can be determined what that repentance toward GOD, and faith toward our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is, which the go&s;|pel requires; and a man may know when he complies with the go&s;pel covenant; but it cannot be determined what Mr. M.'s external covenant requires; nor can any man know when he complies with it.</P>
<P>THE lowe&s;t degree of true grace is a real and &s;aving com|pliance with the go&s;pel covenant. <HI>This is life eternal to know thee, the only true God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent.</HI> Joh. 17.3. Where &s;aving grace begins, it &s;hall end in glo|ry. It's &s;pecial nature can be as certainly determined, as the nature of the go&s;pel way of &s;alvation can; for it con|&s;i&s;ts in a compliance with the go&s;pel. But this external covenant is neither law, nor go&s;pel.</P>
<P>No man will &s;ay, that "the lea&s;t degree of endeavour," which ever takes place in an ungodly man, is all that is re|quired, to bring men into the external covenant. Nor will any man &s;ay, "that the greate&s;t degree of endeavour" that ever takes place in an ungodly man, is nece&s;&s;ary to this end. Nor can any man fix upon any certain degree, between the lea&s;t &amp; the greate&s;t, that is the very degree nece&s;&s;ary to bring a man into this covenant. It is a blind affair, and is adapt|ed only to a blind con&s;cience.</P>
<P>Every ungodly man, who&s;e con&s;cience is thoro'ly awa|kened to know the truth about him&s;elf, knows that he is dead in &s;in, an enemy to God, "utterly indi&s;po&s;ed, di&s;|abled and oppo&s;ite to all good, and wholly inclined to all evil;" as Mr. M. will allow. And therefore, were &s;uch men to make a profe&s;&s;ion of the truth, they would profe&s;s this&punc; and confe&s;s them&s;elves to be altogether helple&s;s and undone, under the wrath of God, the cur&s;e of the law, and condemned by the go&s;pel; (Joh. 3.18, 36.

and incapable of entering into covenant with God, (P&s;. 50.16.) and coming into the kingdom of Chri&s;t, until they are born again. Joh. 3.5.&mdash;And how much &s;oever pains &s;uch may take, to e&s;cape everla&s;ting burnings, they can never think, that this labour of their's brings them into covenant with the holy One of I&s;rael, &s;o long as they find them&s;elves dead in &s;in, enemies to God and rejecters of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.

<P>Yea, the be&s;t &s;aint on earth would not dare, with his eyes open, to enter into covenant with the holy One of I&s;rael, without a Mediator; or in the neglect of him whom God has provided, on the foot of his own righteou&s;ne&s;s. No &s;aint can have impudence enough, with his eyes open, to offer &s;uch a thing to God. For &s;uch know no way to come to the Father but by the Son. Joh. 14.6. But &s;elf-righ|teous &s;inners, with &s;tupid con&s;ciences, are good enough to come nigh to God in their own names, and enter into co|venant with God in their own &s;trength and in their own righteou&s;ne&s;s, while, with their whole heart, they reject the Mediator and the Sanctifier revealed in the go&s;pel. But that bapti&s;m and the Lord's-&s;upper &s;hould be &s;o degraded and pro&s;tituted, as to become &s;eals to this <HI>&s;elf-righteous, gracele&s;s covenant of works,</HI> mu&s;t be not a little &s;hocking to many pious minds.

<HEAD><HI>SECT. VII.</HI> Various di&s;tinctions &s;tated, to render the &s;ubjct more ea&s;y to be under&s;tood by Chri&s;tians of the weake&s;t capacities, and to enable them to an&s;wer the u&s;ual objections, at lea&s;t to their own &s;ati&s;|faction.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. WE are to di&s;tingui&s;h between objections, which are taken from the nature of the covenant, as con|tained in the written in&s;trument, and tho&s;e objections which are taken from the character of many that have &s;ealed it. If there was not one unholy gracele&s;s duty required of A|braham, in that covenant, Gen. 17. With which he com|plied, and which he &s;ealed, Mr. M. mu&s;t lo&s;e his cau&s;e, al|tho' the names and &s;eals of thou&s;ands of gracele&s;s hypo|crites are found annexed to it. For the nature of a written covenant is to be determined from the contents of it, and not from the hypocri&s;y of the men that have &s;igned &amp; &s;ealed it. As for example, &s;uppo&s;e we have a bond of &pound;. 1000, &s;igned and &s;ealed by a man not worth a groat; it alters not the ca&s;e, the bond is a bond of &pound;. 1000, as much as it was &s;igned and &s;ealed by a man ever &s;o rich. For all mankind are agreed in this, that the nature of the bond is to be de|termined from the contents of the written in&s;trument, and not from the poverty or knavery of the &s;igners and &s;ealers.</P>
<P>If the covenant with Abraham was the covenant of grace, yet po&s;&s;ibly thou&s;ands of gracele&s;s men might be active in &s;ealing it. Or if the covenant with Abraham re|quired only freedom from open &s;candal, yet po&s;&s;ibly it might be &s;ealed by thou&s;ands who lived in open &s;candal. The ten tribes, for ought that appears, practi&s;ed circumci|&s;ion without one exception; and yet they lived in open idolatry from the time of their revolt to their captivity: That is, about 250 years. And if we are to determine the nature of the covenant from the character of the &s;ealers; then, from this, it will follow, that freedom from open ido|latry was not required of the I&s;raelites, in the covenant which they were under, and of which circumci&s;ion was a &s;eal.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="55" REF="011174_0036_0F857FFFAA7585A8">2. We ought to di&s;tingui&s;h between <HI>fact</HI> and <HI>right,</HI> and to under&s;tand, that there is no conclu&s;ive arguing from the one to the other. As for in&s;tance. It is fact that there were tares &s;owed in the field; but it does not follow, that it was right that the &s;ervants &s;hould &s;ow them there: this was the work of the devil.&mdash;It is fact, that there was a man who came into the vi&s;ible church without a wedding garment; but it does not follow, that it was right for him &s;o to do.&mdash;It is fact, that there were fal&s;e profe&s;&s;ors, who unawares crept into the apo&s;tolic churches. But it does not follow, that it was right, that they &s;hould creap in thither.&mdash;It is fact, that the net gathered bad fi&s;hes as well as good; but it does not follow that the fi&s;hermen were employed to gather any but good fi&s;h.&mdash;It is fact, that in the apo&s;tolic age, &s;ome impenitent hypocrites made a profe&s;&s;ion of faith and re|pentance, and were baptized; but it does not follow, that it was right in them to make &s;uch a fal&s;e profe&s;&s;ion.&mdash;It is fact, that the I&s;raelites at Mount Sinai made a fal&s;e profe&s;&s;ion, that they lied to GOD with their tongues, &amp; flattered him with their lips; but it does not follow, either, that it was right for them to do as they did, or that it is right for us to imitate their wicked example.&mdash;It is fact, that there have been in all ages gracele&s;s men in the vi&s;ible church; but it does not follow, either, that they had a right to be there, or, that we ought to lay a&s;ide the covenant of grace and to introduce a gracele&s;s covenant merely in order to open a door for their regular admi&s;&s;ion.&mdash;It is fact, when the doctrines and di&s;cipline of the go&s;pel are brought down to the ta&s;te of carnal men, that they appear to be better plea&s;ed with both; but it does not therefore follow, that it would be right for mini&s;ters to combine to &s;et a&s;ide truth and &s;trictne&s;s and to introduce error and loo&s;ene&s;s, in order to plea&s;e a wicked world.</P>
<P N="3">3. There is a di&s;tinction to be made between an adult per&s;on's <HI>really</HI> entering into covenant, and <HI>vi&s;ibly</HI> entering into covenant. He who complies with the covenant of grace, really enters into it: but he who profe&s;&s;es to comply with it, vi&s;ibly enters into it. The former is peculiar to the
<PB N="56" REF="011174_0037_0F8580007AE45EC8">
godly; but ungodly men may do the latter; for none but the godly comply with the covenant of grace; but many ungodly men profe&s;s to comply with it. And the&s;e are like dry branches.</P>
<P N="4">4. There is a difference between being in the covenant of grace, by a compliance with it; and being under the bonds of the covenant of grace, without a compliance with it. The former is peculiar to the godly; and from this &s;tate of grace none fall away; the latter is true of the mo&s;t &s;candalous profe&s;&s;or. An adultre&s;s woman may be under the bonds of the marriage covenant; and that even while &s;he per&s;i&s;ts ob&s;tinately in her adulteries; but this gives her no right to the peculiar privileges of a virtuous wife. In this &s;en&s;e the idolatrous I&s;raelites, were <HI>in covenant</HI> with GOD, notwith&s;tanding their ob&s;tinacy in that mo&s;t &s;can|dalous practice of idolatry. Jer. 3.14 But this gave them no right to covenant ble&s;&s;ings. For it is our compliance with the covenant of grace, which gives an intere&s;t in it's ble&s;|&s;ings; and not our being under the bonds of it.&mdash;For, the ten tribes, who are &s;aid, in Jer. 3.14. to be <HI>married to the Lord,</HI> and who had lived in idolatry ever &s;ince the days of Jerebo|am the &s;on of Nebat, for thus <HI>playing the harlot had been put away,</HI> ver. 1. and a <HI>bill of divorce</HI> had been <HI>given</HI> to them. ver. 8. They had been turned out of the promi&s;ed land and &s;ent into captivity, above an hundred years ago. 2 Kin. 17.6. And &s;o had not only forfeited, but were actually di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the external privileges of the Abrahamic co|venant: and yet they were &s;till under <HI>covenant bonds.</HI> And &s;o an excommunicated per&s;on may, in this &s;en&s;e, be &s;aid, to be <HI>in covenant,</HI> even <HI>in the covenant of grace.</HI> For the en|gagement he came under to live according to that covenant all his days, when he made a profe&s;&s;ion of religion, is as binding in the &s;ight of God as ever. But being <HI>in covenant</HI> in this &s;en&s;e, altho' it may increa&s;e obligation and guilt; yet entitles to no covenant privileges.</P>
<P N="5">5. We are to di&s;tingui&s;h between the means which God u&s;eth to bring us to comply with the covenant of grace, and our con&s;enting to &s;eal it in token of compliance. Tho&s;e
<PB N="57" REF="011174_0037_0F8580007AE45EC8">
who have not complied with the covenant of grace may attend the former without lying: but we ought in all ca&s;es to con&s;ent to a covenant in our hearts, before we are active in &s;ealing it with our hands. For to &s;eal a covenant with our hands, when we reject it in our hearts, is in the &s;ight of God to lie: but lying is not a means of grace.</P>
<P N="6">6. We are to di&s;tingui&s;h between the <HI>man</HI>'s rule and the <HI>church</HI>'s rule of judging concerning his fitne&s;s publickly to enter into covenant, and publickly to &s;eal it. The man him&s;elf makes his judgment by looking into his own heart; but the church make their judgment by looking only to what is vi&s;ible. Ju&s;t as it is when men &s;wear allegiance to the <HI>king</HI> and renounce the <HI>pretender.</HI> The man who takes the oath of allegiance and abjuration, &s;ees his way clear to do &s;o, by looking inward, and finding &s;uch an heart in him; but he who admini&s;ters the oaths, judges concerning the propriety of his own conduct in &s;o doing, only by what outwardly appears. And thus it is al&s;o when per&s;ons en|ter into the marriage covenant; they &s;ee their way clear to act, by looking, each one, into his own heart, and find|ing &s;uch affections in them&s;elves, as are an&s;werable to the external tran&s;action before them: but he who leads them to enter into the marriage covenant, judges of the propriety of his conduct only by what is vi&s;ible. A man by looking into his own heart may be certain, that he believes and loves the doctrines of the go&s;pel; but the church by out|ward appearances can be certain of neither. Peter was cer|tain he believed. Mat. 16.16. And as certain that he loved. Joh. 21.15, 16, 17. And it is the duty of all to believe and love as he did. The blame is wholly in our&s;elves, if we do not. But we ought not to profe&s;s faith and love, till we &s;ee our way clear; &s;o as that in profe&s;&s;ing we may act an hone&s;t and con&s;cientious part: even as it would be a wicked thing, for per&s;ons to enter into the mar|riage covenant, if the prevailing judgment of their own minds, were, that they were not in a proper &s;tate for &s;uch a tran&s;action.&mdash;However, it mu&s;t be owned, that not to love Chri&s;t above all things, not to be willing to for&s;ake
<PB N="58" REF="011174_0038_0F8580012047DAE0">
all for his &s;ake, and not to e&s;pou&s;e his cau&s;e and intere&s;t heartily before men is mo&s;t inexcu&s;able wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>Therefore,</P>
<P N="7">7. We are to di&s;tingui&s;h between things not at all com|manded to any man; as eating blood: and things cer|tainly commanded to &s;ome men; as to confe&s;s Chri&s;t before men. It is wrong to eat blood, if we at all doubt of the lawfulne&s;s of it, becau&s;e it is not a commanded duty to any man. So <HI>he that doubteth is damned if he eat;</HI> i. e. is &s;elf-condemned, becau&s;e in &s;uch a ca&s;e as this he ought not to eat. But it will not hence follow, that we &s;hall be &s;elf-condemned, if we confe&s;s Chri&s;t before men without full a&s;&s;urance. For, by the command of Chri&s;t we are bound in duty, if we are on his &s;ide in our hearts, openly to con|fe&s;s him before men. If we neglect it, in this ca&s;e, we &s;in. And if we do it in hypocri&s;y, we &s;in. A man's con&s;cience in all &s;uch like ca&s;es will lead him to act according to his prevailing judgment. It is in fact thus, with the con&s;ci|entious part of mankind, in all doubtful matters; if they are obliged to act one way or the other; they make con|&s;cience of acting according to prevailing evidence.</P>
<P N="8">8. We are to di&s;tingui&s;h between objections, which ap|pear to be equally again&s;t both &s;chemes, and other objec|tions: and are to look upon the former as of no weight to &s;ettle the controver&s;y. If they &s;ay, it is difficult to know whether we comply with the covenant of grace; we may an&s;wer, that it is as difficult, and more &s;o, for any man to know whether he complies with the external covenant. If they &s;ay, the church cannot be certain that any man has &s;a|ving grace; we may an&s;wer, neither can the church be cer|tain that any man believes in his heart, the doctrines which he profe&s;&s;es with his mouth. If they &s;ay, a&s;&s;urance of our right to come is nece&s;&s;ary on our &s;cheme; we may an&s;wer, that it is no more nece&s;&s;ary on one &s;cheme than on the other. Be&s;ides, a&s;&s;urance of a right to come is attainable by true &s;aints; but no man can know that he has a right on Mr. M's &s;cheme. Becau&s;e no man can know what his external co|venant requires. If they &s;ay, Peter had not time to exa|mine
<PB N="59" REF="011174_0038_0F8580012047DAE0">
into the gracious &s;tate of the three thou&s;and converts on the day of penteco&s;t; we may an&s;wer, that he had as much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> for this, as to examine into their doctrinal know|ledge and moral &s;incerity.&mdash;So al&s;o, tho&s;e objections ought to weigh nothing, which are taken merely from the wick|edne&s;s of mankind, and which would vani&s;h of them&s;elves, &s;hould the Spirit of God be poured from on high, as it was when the fir&s;t chri&s;tian church was &s;et up. For there is no more rea&s;on, that the di&s;cipline of Chri&s;t's hou&s;e &s;hould be brought down to &s;uit our corruptions, than that the doc|trines of the go&s;pel &s;hould al&s;o.</P>
<P N="9">9. We ought to di&s;tingui&s;h between an appeal to <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> and an appeal to <HI>corruption.</HI> For example, the&s;e words are contained in the marriage covenant, unto which we oblige the woman to give her con&s;ent, viz. "You take this A. B. for your married hu&s;band, and promi&s;e to be a loving, faith|ful and obedient wife to him," &amp;c. Should a few women object again&s;t this covenant, and publickly propo&s;e an al|teration, &s;aying, "We pray, that the words, <HI>loving, faithful and obedient</HI> may be left out, for the &s;ake of &s;ome young <HI>women of tender con&s;ciences,</HI> who cannot &s;ee their way clear to u&s;e them." The only que&s;tion would be this, "ought the alteration to be made in the marriage covenant, or in the young women?" Or in other words, "which is wrong, the woman's heart, or the covenant?" A que&s;tion, which may ea&s;ily be decided, if we appeal to rea&s;on or to &s;cripture: but if we appeal to corruption, the more we wrangle, the more we may, &s;ome might &s;ay, <Q>If the covenant is not altered, no woman can be married without full a&s;&s;urance. For it is not lawful to enter into this covenant in doubt. For <HI>he that doubteth is damned.</HI> An infallible a&s;&s;urance therefore is nece&s;&s;ary. But who has this? Or what wo|man, on this plan, can be married, with a good con|&s;cience? And, be&s;ides, what prie&s;t can be able to judge, whether any are fit to be married? By what rule &s;hall it be certainly known, when a woman is really di&s;po&s;ed to be a <HI>loving, faithful and obedient</HI> wife, and when &s;he is not? Moreover, it will only tempt bad women to make
<PB N="60" REF="011174_0039_0F85800202165CE0">
a lying profe&s;&s;ion, while women of tender con&s;ciences will be kept back; and tho&s;e who are married will grow proud becau&s;e they are judged to be qualified. Mean while, the failings of married women will be more taken notice of, to their di&s;honor, for u&s;ing this covenant. Upon the whole, it is a very bad plan, and a thing of a very dangerous tendency; therefore, we propo&s;e, that in all future times, the&s;e words, <HI>loving, faithful, obedient,</HI> be left out of the marriage covenant.</Q>&mdash;How ridiculous would any woman make her&s;elf, that &s;hould advance &s;uch &s;tuff! But if this cla&s;s of women were the majority, they might make a &s;hocking noi&s;e, but there would be no more &s;en&s;e in it, than if but one &s;ingle woman was in the &s;cheme.</P>

The piety of this new generation God re|membered many ages after, Jer. 2.2. <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord, I remember thee, the kindne&s;s of thy youth, the love of thine e&s;|pou&s;als</HI>&mdash;ver. 3. <HI>I&s;rael was holine&s;s to the Lord.</HI> See al&s;o Judg. 2.7. <HI>And the people &s;erved the Lord all the days of Jo&s;hua, and all the days of the elders that out lived Jo&s;hua.</HI> So that they tran&s;mitted the true religion to the next generation, and kept it up all the days of their lives.&mdash;And if the&s;e things are well con&s;idered, and the great comparative darkne&s;s of that age of the world, and the abundant pains which Mo&s;es took in the plains of Moab to explain the covenant, and to render them deeply &s;en&s;ible of their obligations to comply with it, with all their hearts, no man will find cau&s;e to &s;ay, that Mo&s;es acted an unfaithful part, in leading that people, to enter into that very covenant, in the manner he did.</P>
<P>OBJECT. But it was the de&s;ign of Mo&s;es to charge in a public manner, as what vi&s;ibly and publickly appeared to be the truth of the ca&s;e, tho&s;e very individual per&s;ons with being unregenerate, on that very day, in which he led them to enter into covenant. For he &s;ays, <HI>the Lord hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to &s;ee, and ears to hear unto this day.</HI> Deut. 29.4. p. 18.24.</P>
<P>ANS. It is evident, that in the public &s;peech which Mo|&s;es
<PB N="62" REF="011174_0040_0F858002DB7D00A8">
made to the I&s;raelites, in the plains of Moab, of which the&s;e words are a part, he con&s;tantly addre&s;&s;es them in their national capacity, and not as individuals. Thus, in the pa|ragraph in which the&s;e words are contained, ver. 2. <HI>Mo&s;es called unto all I&s;rael, and &s;aid unto them, ye have &s;een all that the Lord did before your eyes, in the land of Egypt, &amp;c.</HI> Where|as every one in the congregation, who were but one month under forty years of age, which was doubtle&s;s by far the greate&s;t part of the congregation, never were in Egypt, for they were born in the wilderne&s;s, &s;ince their fathers left Egypt. And in&s;tances of the like nature are to be ob&s;erved thro' the whole &s;peech. Thus, we know, that the carca&s;&s;es of the men that &s;inned at <HI>Kade&s;h barnea,</HI> on the return of the &s;pies, were all of them fallen in the wilderne&s;s; and yet he &s;peaks to the pre&s;ent generation, who per&s;onally had no hand in that &s;in, as tho' they were the very individual per&s;ons, that had committed it. Ch. 9.23. <HI>Then you rebelled again&s;t the commandment of the Lord.</HI> See al&s;o Deut. 1.19&mdash;35. Where|as there was not one of tho&s;e rebels alive; no not &s;o much as one. Num. 26.63&mdash;65. And this is preci&s;ely the truth of the ca&s;e, with the text under con&s;ideration. For,</P>
<P>Mo&s;es brought in no public charges again&s;t the nation, but for public crimes, not an in&s;tance can be produced from the beginning of Deuteronomy to the text under con&s;idera|tion. But this new generation, which were grown up, &amp; which were now about to enter into covenant with God, had not been guilty of any public crimes, to give them&s;elves a bad character. It does not appear from the whole &s;tory, that Mo&s;es had any public grounds, for a public charge a|gain&s;t them, as being an ungodly generation. Nay, the fact is, that they always behaved &s;o well, both before and after, that they were by God him&s;elf, after they were dead and gone, repre&s;ented as a very religious and godly generation, Jer 2.2, 3. Jud. 2.7. Compared to a <HI>choice vine,</HI> I&s;ai. 5.2. <HI>Wholly a right &s;eed,</HI> Jer. 2.21.</P>
<P>To &s;uppo&s;e Mo&s;es charged them in a public manner, as an unregenerate, ungodly generation, unju&s;tly, without e|ver mentioning one &s;ingle fact to the di&s;advantage of their
<PB N="63" REF="011174_0040_0F858002DB7D00A8">
character, is very unrea&s;onable: e&s;pecially as the &s;en&s;e be|fore given to the words under con&s;ideration is an ea&s;y and natural &s;en&s;e, and removes all difficulties, and renders the &s;peech and conduct of Mo&s;es perfectly con&s;i&s;tent. For, as to all the in&s;tances of public conduct contained in the long narrative, which Mo&s;es had given, from the time they left Egypt, to that very day, which were evidences, of blind eyes, deaf ears, and hard hearts, this pre&s;ent generation were not active in them. Tho&s;e facts, tho&s;e public crimes, altho' committed by that nation, were not done by the in|dividual per&s;ons, which made up the pre&s;ent congregation, who entered into covenant with God, but by the old gene|ration, who&s;e carca&s;&s;es were fallen in the wilderne&s;s; as any man may &s;ee that will read all the preceeding chapters of the book, We ought not, by giving a wrong &s;en&s;e to the words of Mo&s;es, to render his public &s;peech and his public conduct incon&s;i&s;tent; and then to charge him with acting a di&s;hone&s;t part, in leading that people to enter into cove|nant, in the manner in which, in fact, he did: or to deny the fact, under a pretence of &s;aving his character; when indeed his character cannot be &s;aved this way, becau&s;e the fact is undeniably true.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould be enquired, why did Mo&s;es &s;peak thus, to this pre&s;ent generation, as they had not been per&s;onally guilty of that cour&s;e of rebellious conduct them&s;elves; but were them&s;elves a godly generation?&mdash;The an&s;wer is ea&s;y. &mdash;He did it to give them a clear view and humbling &s;en&s;e of their national &s;ins, and the ju&s;tice of God in the national judgments which he brought upon them; that they might know, that it was not for their righteou&s;ne&s;s, that God did bring them into that good land; but merely of his great goodne&s;s, and becau&s;e he had promi&s;ed it to Abraham. Deut. 9.5. to the end they might &s;o reflect on the depra|vity of their own hearts, and be &s;o deeply aba&s;ed before God, as to be thereby prepared for that holy and &s;olemn tran&s;action before them, of entering into covenant with the holy One of I&s;rael: that having in view, how their fathers had entered into covenant at Sinai, and had broken cove|nant,
<PB N="64" REF="011174_0041_0F85800381A11D40">
&s;o that all their carca&s;&s;es had fallen in the wilderne&s;s, they might take warning thereby, and remember and keep the covenant of the Lord their God; that it might be well with them, and with their children after them.</P>
<P N="12">12. We are to di&s;tingui&s;h between the character which the three thou&s;and converts on the day of penteco&s;t, gave of them&s;elves, in that deep conviction of &s;in and guilt which they manife&s;ted, when they appeared to be <HI>pricked at the heart,</HI> and in that repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t which they openly profe&s;&s;ed, when they appeared cordially to comply with Peter's exhortation, <HI>Repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Je&s;us, for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins,</HI> by <HI>gladly receiving his word,</HI> and offering them|&s;elves to bapti&s;m, and to join with a per&s;ecuted party, who&s;e ma&s;ter had lately been put to a mo&s;t &s;hameful and &s;canda|lous death, in the mo&s;t public manner, on the mo&s;t public occa&s;ion, at the ri&s;que of every thing dear to them in the world:&mdash;And the character which men ordinarily give of them&s;elves, in offering to join with the church, without any &s;pecial concern about their &s;ouls, when it is e&s;teemed no &s;mall honor, to be church members, and enjoy church pri|vileges.&mdash;The former, to a judgment of charity, appeared to be true converts, whatever may be thought of the latter.</P>
<P N="13">13. We are to di&s;tingui&s;h between what is <HI>vi&s;ible,</HI> and what is <HI>real:</HI> Many in the eyes of men are reputed godly, who in the eyes of God as &s;earcher of hearts are not &s;o. The former have a right in the &s;ight of the church to enter into the covenant of grace, in a public profe&s;&s;ion, and to &s;eal the covenant: but the latter only have a right in the &s;ight of God. For the former appear to be godly; but the latter only are really &s;o. The former have a vi&s;ible, the latter have a real right.</P>
<P N="14">14. There is a di&s;tinction to be made between a right to &s;ealing ordinances on <HI>our own account,</HI> and a right on the <HI>account of another.</HI> Thus pious parents have a right for &s;eal|ing ordinances for them&s;elves, on their own account, as being them&s;elves really in covenant with God, by a com|pliance with it: but their infant children have a right to
<PB N="65" REF="011174_0041_0F85800381A11D40">
bapti&s;m, not on their own account, but &s;imply on that of their parents, con&s;idered as parts of their parents, branches grown out of the old root: and &s;o may be baptized with|out re&s;pect to any internal qualification, at pre&s;ent, inherent in them, either moral or gracious.</P>
<P>Object. If, in infant bapti&s;m, no re&s;pect is had to any internal qualification in the infant, then the &s;eal is &s;et to a blank.</P>
<P>An&s;w. <HI>Then</HI> the &s;eal is &s;et to a blank, when there is no covenant entered into: but when there is a covenant en|tered into, and &s;ealed, there is no room for the objection. But in infant-bapti&s;m there is a covenant entered into. For God &s;ays to the pious parent, "I will be a God to thee, and to thy &s;eed." And the pious parent replies, "I choo&s;e thee for my God and the God of my child." So that here is a covenant entered into between God and the pious pa|rent, in behalf of him&s;elf and his infant, in the very act of offering it to God in bapti&s;m. And bapti&s;m is a &s;eal, not to a blank, but to this covenant, which, in fact, takes place between God and the pious parent.</P>
<P N="15">15. We are to di&s;tingui&s;h between covenanting with God actively, in a vi&s;ible manner, as a pious parent does, when he dedicates his child to God in bapti&s;m, and promi&s;es to bring it up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord; and being laid under the bonds of the covenant pa&s;&s;ively, as is the ca&s;e with the child. God &s;peaks to the pious pa|rent in that ordinance, &s;aying, <Q>I will be a God to thee, and to thy &s;eed, i. e. if they will take heed to walk in my ways.</Q> The pious parent an&s;wers, in the act of of|fering the child to bapti&s;m, "I choo&s;e thee for my God, and for the God of my child. And I promi&s;e to bring up my child for thee. And, Oh, that it might live in thy &s;ight, be thy child, and walk in thy ways!" The parent is active; but the child is merely pa&s;&s;ive. We may bring our|&s;elves under the bonds of the covenant, by our own act and deed, as the adult did in the plains of Moab when they re|newed covenant there: or we may be brought under the bonds of the covenant, by the act of another, authorized by
<PB N="66" REF="011174_0042_0F85800443B8A300">
God &s;o to do. Thus Mo&s;es laid all the infants in the con|gregation, in the plains of Moab, under the bonds of the covenant. And thus parents, in offering their children to bapti&s;m, lay them under the bonds of the covenant.</P>
<P N="16">16. IF no one is to be baptized, till, by his own act and deed, he enters into covenant with God, be it the covenant of grace or a gracele&s;s covenant; then no infant is to be baptized on either plan: becau&s;e no infant, by his own act and deed, enters into any covenant of any &s;ort; or &s;o much as knows, that there is any covenant of any &s;ort, to be en|tered into.&mdash;If the child has a right to bapti&s;m, on it's pa|rents account, and not on it's own, infant-bapti&s;m, can be vindicated, as well on the plan of a gracious covenant, as on the plan of an ungracious one; but if the child's right to bapti&s;m is founded on it's own per&s;onal compliance with the covenant, infant-bapti&s;m mu&s;t be given up on the plan of a covenant of moral &s;incerity and a right doctrinal belief; for no infant was ever thus qualified: But &s;ome infants have been &s;anctified from the womb, and &s;o in this &s;en&s;e have been in the covenant of grace. Luk. 1.15.</P>
<P N="17">17. IT mu&s;t apparently be an un&s;peakable advantage, to be under the watch and care of a godly church, who have a real &s;pirit of fidelity in them; and, like Abraham, will command all, under their care, to fear the Lord. Gen. 18.19. And it is equally evident, that it can be of no advan|tage, to be under the watch and care of an ungodly church, who will neither walk in the ways of God them&s;elves, nor bring up tho&s;e committed to their care for God. God put confidence in Abraham, <HI>I know him, that he will command his children and his hou&s;hold after him,</HI> &amp;c. But there is no con|fidence to be put in an ungodly man, that he will be faith|ful to God, with re&s;pect to his own &s;oul, or the &s;ouls of his children. Ho&s;. 6.4. Mat. 7.16, 17, 18.</P>

<P>THERE are three things in Mr. M.'s external cove|nant, viz. The conditions required, the privileges promi&s;ed and the &s;eals; and his ideas concerning each of the&s;e, as expre&s;&s;ed in his book, are incon&s;i&s;tent.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="67" REF="011174_0042_0F85800443B8A300">I. As to the conditions required, in order to a covenant right to all covenant privileges, his ideas are incon&s;i&s;tent.&mdash;For,</P>
<P N="1">1. Sometimes he makes circumci&s;ion the only condition. "For that by which," &s;ays he, <Q>any one was to enter into this covenant, was an external mark in the fle&s;h. <HI>This is my covenant, which ye &s;hall keep between me and you, and thy &s;eed after thee; every man-child among you &s;hall be circum|ci&s;ed.</HI> But that by which any one enters into the cove|nant of grace is <HI>the circumci&s;ion of the heart.</HI></Q> p. 7. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"That by which any one enters into the covenant of grace is the circumci&s;ion of the heart:" and yet he is obliged to deny this p. 21; and to affirm that the circumci&s;ion of the heart intends no more then en|tering into his external gracele&s;s covenant, in order to get rid of that plain text Ezek. 44.9. <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord God, no &s;tranger uncircumci&s;ed in heart, &amp;c. &s;hall enter into my &s;anctuary;</HI> which is a prophecy of the glorious &s;tate of the church &s;poken of. I&s;ai. 2.3, 4, 5, Chap. 11.1&mdash;9. and 60.21. When Satan will be bound agreeable to Rev. 20. and when Mr. M.'s external covenant will be no more practi&s;ed upon in the whole earth for a thou&s;and years. For in that day, <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord God, no &s;tran|ger uncircumci&s;ed in heart <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hall enter into my &s;anctuary.</HI> i. e. none &s;hall be admitted but &s;uch who in their profe&s;&s;ion, life and conver&s;ation appear to be Godly. For in that day right doctrine and right di&s;cipline will uni|ver&s;ally take place, and then all will be agreed: <HI>For they &s;hall &s;ee eye to eye.</HI> I&s;ai. 52.8.</NOTE> So that the circumci&s;ion of the fle&s;h brings men into the exter|nal covenant, and gives them a covenant right to all it's privileges; ju&s;t as the circumci&s;ion of the heart brings men into the covenant of grace, and gives them a covenant right to all the ble&s;&s;ings of that. But the circumci&s;ion of the heart as the phra&s;e is u&s;ed in &s;cripture, is a real compliance with the covenant of grace, and is connected with eternal life. Rom. 2.29. And accordingly he &s;peaks of the cir|cumci&s;ion of the fle&s;h as a compliance with the external co|venant, p. 8. "This covenant remained to be complied with:&mdash;Abraham mu&s;t needs be circumci&s;ed."</P>
<P>And, indeed, if Mr. M. was di&s;po&s;ed to turn the covenant with Abraham into his external covenant, of nece&s;&s;ity the circumci&s;ion of the fle&s;h mu&s;t be the only condition of it; becau&s;e there was nothing el&s;e external which took place in that covenant recorded in Gen. 17. to which Mr. M. could with any colour lay claim, for Abraham made no profe&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="68" REF="011174_0043_0F858004DCDFE820">
but a profe&s;&s;ion of &s;aving faith. But this was a vi&s;ible com|pliance with the covenant of grace, and not with the exter|nal covenant. If, therefore, he did any thing at all, by way of compliance with Mr. M.'s external covenant, it was on|ly, merely &amp; &s;imply making 'an external mark in the fle&s;h.'</P>
<P N="2">2. And as Mr. M. thus &s;ometimes repre&s;ents the circum|ci&s;ion of the fle&s;h, to be a compliance with the external co|venant with Abraham; &s;o he &s;ometimes repre&s;ents bapti&s;m, as entitling to all the privileges of his external covenant, under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation. For according to him, all who are baptized "are Abraham's children, and heirs ac|cording to the promi&s;e." p. 13. "For a child baptized in infancy," he &s;ays, <Q>is thereby as really brought into cove|nant, as one that is baptized in riper years.&mdash;It conveys the &s;ame privileges to the one as to the other.</Q> p. 16. But the adult, having made a profe&s;&s;ion, were, in the apo&s;|tolic age, by bapti&s;m, received into full communion with the church, in compleat &s;tanding, as is evident from Act. 2.37&mdash;47.&mdash;And in this view, Mr. M. con&s;iders infant bapti&s;m, as "a valuable privilege"&mdash;"as it entitles to the appointed means of grace," p. 54, 55. that is, to all church privileges. And in&s;i&s;ts, that tho&s;e, who are baptized in infancy <Q>&s;hould be told, that they are really in covenant with God, that they are members of the vi&s;ible church, and are entitled to the privileges of it.</Q> And as they have a title to the privileges, &s;o "they are in duty bound to &s;eek the enjoyment of and attend upon the&s;e privileges." p. 55, 56. For, according to Mr. M. <Q>a child dedicated to God in bapti&s;m, is thereby brought into covenant with God, and has a promi&s;e left to it, of the means of grace, and the &s;trivings of God's holy Spirit, in order to render them effectual for &s;alvation: but an unbaptized child is left in the kingdom of darkne&s;s.</Q> p. 59, 60. And he adds <Q>it is but trifling to &s;ay, that altho' baptized per&s;ons may be &s;tiled members of the church univer&s;al; yet they are not members of any particular church.</Q> p. 56.&mdash;So that, upon the whole, it appears, that by bapti&s;m alone, infants are made members of the church, in &s;uch &s;ort, as to
<PB N="69" REF="011174_0043_0F858004DCDFE820">
have a divine right and title to all church privileges: which is full as much as can be &s;aid of any, who are in full commu|nion, in compleat &s;tanding.&mdash;And thus we &s;ee what Mr. M's &s;cheme is, in this view of it. And here let us &s;top a mo|ment or two, and look round, and con&s;ider where we are now. For if the&s;e things are true, it will follow,</P>
<P N="1">1. That no internal, mental qualifications are now, or ever were requi&s;ite, in order to a right to all church privi|leges in the &s;ight of God; neither moral, nor gracious; neither faith, nor practice, of one &s;ort, or of the other; no, nothing at all, but only "an external mark in the fle&s;h," or water bapti&s;m. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The land of Canaan was one chief external ble&s;&s;ing of the Abraha|mic covenant. Gen. 17.8. A compliance with that covenant gave a covenant right to a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. Num. 32.11, 12. The I&s;raelites who came out of Egypt were all circumci&s;ed. Jo&s;h. 5.5. If in circumci&s;ion, they fully complied with that covenant, on their part; then their carca&s;|&s;es did not fall in the wilderne&s;s, becau&s;e they on their part broke cove|nant, but becau&s;e God broke covenant on his part. They on their part fulfilled the only condition on which the land of Canaan was promi&s;ed, but God was not true to the covenant on his part. So the fault was not in them, but in him. And in this view, Lev. 26. and Deut. 28. are en|tirely incon&s;i&s;tent with the Abrahamic covenant. And &s;o al&s;o is the di|vine conduct in the expul&s;ion of the Jews out of the land of Canaan by Nebuchadnezzar formerly, as well as in their pre&s;ent di&s;per&s;ion. For they, on their parts, have always kept covenant. For they have always cir|cumci&s;ed their children, from the time they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the land of Canaan to this day. Nor can P&s;al 50.16. I&s;a. 1, 10&mdash;1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">. Ezek. 44.9. Mat. 5.23, 24. Heb. 3.19. and an hundred other texts be recon|ciled with this &s;cheme.</P>
<P>And if bapti&s;m alone, without re&s;pect to any mental qualification, gives a covenant right to all the external privileges of the vi&s;ible church of Chri&s;t; then no con&s;i&s;tent meaning can be given to the&s;e texts, Mat. 18.17. Mat. 22.12. Cor. 5.11. and Chap. 11.28, 29. Tit. 3.10.11. Rev. 2.4, 5. &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;The truth is, by &s;ealing a covenant we are bound to fulfil it: but it is an actual compliance with a covenant, that entitles us to its ble&s;&s;ings. Lev. 26. Deut. 28. Rom. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">.13. Mat. 3.9, 10.</P></NOTE> And, therefore</P>
<P N="2">2. In order to our being &s;atisfied, in our own con&s;cien|ces, that we have a right in the &s;ight of God to come to the Lord's-table, we are not <Q>to examine our&s;elves of our knowledge to di&s;cern the Lord's body, of our faith to feed upon him, of our repentance, love and new obedience</Q>
<PB N="70" REF="011174_0044_0F85800723E1AB40">
<HI>as the a&s;&s;embly of divines</HI> imagined an hundred and twenty years ago: Nor are we to examine our&s;elves of our doctri|nal knowlege, orthodoxy, moral &s;incerity, or of any thing el&s;e, of an internal, mental nature. For a right to the Lord's-&s;upper has no dependance on any thing of this na|ture. For, but one thing was needful to &s;atisfy the con|&s;cience of the Jew, <HI>viz.</HI> "The external mark in the fle&s;h," which might ea&s;ily be known. And the chri&s;tian has no|thing to do, but to procure and keep by him, a well atte&s;|ted certificate of his bapti&s;m, to give him a full a&s;&s;urance of his right to come to the Lord's-table. For,</P>
<P N="3">3. No crime, altho' of the mo&s;t &s;candalous nature, could vacate this right, in the &s;ight of God, or in the &s;ight of con&s;cience; becau&s;e this right was not founded in any mo|ral qualifications what&s;oever, but only in "an external mark in the fle&s;h," or water bapti&s;m. But the idolatry of the Jew did not at all take away "the external mark in the fle&s;h;" nor can the open infidelity and debauchery of the chri&s;tian prove, that the certificate, which he has, of his bapti&s;m, is not authentick. Let the idolatrous Jew look on "the external mark in the fle&s;h," and let the infidel and immoral chri&s;tian look on his certificate, and their con&s;ci|ences may be confirmed, in a full a&s;&s;urance of their divine right and title to all covenant privileges. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><P>This is a &s;hort and ea&s;y method for di&s;hone&s;t, cheating, promi&s;e-braeking profe&s;&s;ors to come to the Lord's Table with a good con&s;cience; and for tho&s;e who live in the <HI>neglect of family prayer,</HI> and who in&s;tead of bringing up their children in the <HI>nurture and admonition of the Lord,</HI> train them up to <HI>live after the fle&s;h, in chambering and wantonne&s;s;</HI> while they them|&s;elves live <HI>in malice and envy</HI> towards their fellow profe&s;&s;ors.&mdash;Mr. M. is of opinion, that it is of very bad and dangerous tendency, for tho&s;e who are admitted into the church to make a profe&s;&s;ion of Godline&s;s, le&s;t by their ungodly lives they &s;hould di&s;grace their profe&s;&s;ion, and tempt others to turn infidels. p. 53.54. And for the &s;ame rea&s;on it is not be&s;t that any of the profe&s;&s;ed followers of Chri&s;t &s;hould pretend to be hone&s;t men, left their di&s;hone&s;t practices &s;hould &s;ink the holy religion of Chri&s;t into contempt, and promote infidelity in the world. For indeed, it is come to this already, that among the Mohometans, it is a common thing when men are charged with cheating, or &s;u&s;pected of any di&s;hone&s;t trick, to reply with indignation, "what! do you think I am a chri&s;tian?" &mdash;</P>
<P>Nor can it be ju&s;tified, in Mr. M.'s way of rea&s;oning, for the church to require a profe&s;&s;ion of moral hone&s;ty, of tho&s;e whom they admit to full communion. For every one of his objections again&s;t a profe&s;&s;ion of Godline&s;s are of full force again&s;t a profe&s;&s;ion of a di&s;po&s;ition hone&s;tly to pay our debts; and act up to our word and promi&s;e in our dealings with our fellow-men &mdash;For (1.) &s;uch an hone&s;t di&s;po&s;ition is an invi&s;ible quali|fication, and we cannot be certain the men have it in their hearts; and therefore on this plan there can be no vi&s;ible church p. 48.&mdash;Be&s;ides, (2) according to this, the de&s;ign of God mu&s;t have been to have made a vi&s;ible di&s;tinction between hone&s;t and di&s;hone&s;t men. But this is contrary to &s;cripture, which repre&s;ents the vi&s;ible church like a net which catches all &s;orts, good and bad. P. 49, 50 &mdash; (3.) Admi&s;&s;ion to full communion on this plan will do hurt to men's &s;ouls, tend to make them think they are hone&s;t when they are not, and to blow up pride in their hearts, and to make them &s;ay with the phari&s;ee, <HI>God I thank thee, I am not as others are, extortioners, unju&s;t.</HI> &amp;c. P. 52.53.&mdash;And (4.) it will tend greatly to wound religion, when afterwards they neglect to do as they &s;ay, and are not hone&s;t to pay their debts. P. 54. Be&s;ides, (5.) This &s;cheme makes in|fant bapti&s;m a mere nullity. For if moral hone&s;ty is a nece&s;&s;ary qualifica|tion for &s;ealing ordinances then infants cannot receive the &s;eal. For the church can have no po&s;itive evidence that they have an hone&s;t di&s;po&s;ition. The Anabapti&s;ts therefore are right in rejecting the bapti&s;m of infants. P. 54.</P>
<P>The&s;e are Mr. M.'s "mo&s;t weighty and material objections, an an&s;|wer to which he has never yet &s;een attempted." P. 48 &mdash;But it &s;o happens, that they are of equal weight again&s;t him&s;elf, unle&s;s he will &s;ay, that moral hone&s;ty is not a qualification nece&s;&s;ary for church-member&s;hip.</P></NOTE> Therefore,</P>

The Jew had nothing to do, in order to prove his right, but only to make it appear, that he had been circum|ci&s;ed. And the chri&s;tian has nothing to do, in order to prove his right, but only to make it appear, that he has been baptized. Nor can the church con&s;i&s;tently demand any thing farther, on Mr. M's &s;cheme. For what he &s;ays, p. 22. is the plain, &s;imple truth: <Q>To require more of the per&s;on to be admitted into the church, than is made nece&s;&s;ary by the covenant on which it is framed, is really ab&s;urd.</Q> But if all the&s;e things are true, then it will follow,</P>

For, if bapti&s;m alone is all that is nece&s;&s;ary to a covenant right to all church pri|vileges; then bapti&s;m alone is all that ought to be required in order to an admi&s;&s;ion into the church. Nor is a public profe&s;&s;ion, or freedom from public &s;candal, at all requi&s;ite.

Gal. 3 26, 29. <HI>For ye are all the children of God by faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And if ye are Chri&s;t's, then are ye Abraham's &s;eed, and heirs according to the promi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. M. &s;ays, p. 42. <Q>as to baptized children, I allow they have a right to the &s;acrament of the Lord's-&s;upper, but not a right of immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; according to the apo&s;tle's repre&s;entation in Gal. 4.12. <HI>Now, I &s;ay, that the heir as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a &s;er|vant, tho' he be lord of all, but is under tutors and governors, until the time appointed of the father.</HI></Q>&mdash;But the child, tho' ever &s;o young, eats bread at his father's table, and no one di&s;putes his right. And when the child is of age, and his father is dead, and the e&s;tate is to be divided among the heirs, the child has nothing to do, in order to prove his right to a &s;hare in his father's e&s;tate, but to bring a certifi|cate from the town clerk, in order to prove from the town records, that he is the child of the decea&s;ed. Nor is &s;uch a child obliged to make any profe&s;&s;ion, or to enter into any covenant before <HI>the court of probate,</HI> in order to come to a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his right. The law gives him his right with|out any &s;uch prerequi&s;ites. For his right is not founded upon any thing of &s;uch a nature, but &s;imply upon his being the child of &s;uch a father. This therefore is the only point to be proved. And ju&s;t the &s;ame, to be con&s;i&s;tent, mu&s;t be

the ca&s;e on Mr. M's plan. The only point, which one who was baptized in infancy, has to prove, when he becomes adult, in order to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his right, is that he was bap|tized. Let him therefore produce a well atte&s;ted certificate of this, and nothing farther can be demanded.</P>
<P>If it &s;hould be &s;aid, that all that Mr. M. means is, that bapti&s;m gives a conditional right to the Lord's Table. i. e. a right upon condition of a profe&s;&s;ion of religion and freedom from &s;candal; it may be replied, that the unbapti&s;ed have a right to &s;ealing ordinances upon the&s;e conditions, accor|ding to Mr. M.'s own &s;cheme, and therefore, this cannot be his meaning. For this, to u&s;e his own words, would be to make bapti&s;m "a meer nullity, a thing of naught."&mdash;But this brings us, in the next place, to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="2">II. THAT Mr. M.'s ideas of the peculiar privileges of his external covenant are al&s;o incon&s;i&s;tent.&mdash;For, if it &s;hould be enquired, what advantage hath Mr. M.'s gracele&s;s co|venanter, or what profit is there in bapti&s;m admini&s;tred up|on a gracele&s;s covenant? He has no right, upon his &s;cheme, to the Apo&s;tle's an&s;wer in Rom. 3.1, 2. <HI>Much every way</HI> &amp;c. For.</P>
<P N="1">1. As to <HI>the oracles of God,</HI> which he claims for one of the chief privileges of his external covenant, p. 9. he will grant, that they are common to the unbaptized. i. e. the unbaptized have as good a right to read and hear the word of God, as the baptized have; and as good a right to believe and em|brace the go&s;pel. For, by Chri&s;t's la&s;t commi&s;&s;ion, <HI>the go&s;|pel is to be preached to all nations,</HI> to the uncircumci&s;ed Greek as well as to the circumci&s;ed Jew: yea, to <HI>every creature:</HI> and that, previous to, and in order to prepare men for bapti&s;m, Mar. 16.15, 16. So that, there is not the lea&s;t need of being in his external covenant, in order to have as good a right, to hear and believe and be ju&s;tified by the go&s;pel, as any man on earth has. <HI>For there is no difference.</HI> Rom. 3.22. compare Mat. 10.5, 6. Mar. 28.19.</P>
<P N="2">2. As to &s;ealing ordinances, he is full in it, that bap|ti&s;m alone, gives no right to them, for our &s;elves, or for our children, which can be enjoyed, without a profe&s;&s;ion
<PB N="76" REF="011174_0047_0F85800BE72F76B0">
of the chri&s;tian religion, p. 21, and freedom from &s;candal, p. 44 and one who never was bapti&s;ed, may, on his &s;cheme, he admitted to &s;ealing ordinances, for him&s;elf, and his chil|dren, upon the &s;ame terms; no higher, nor lower, being required. So that there is no advantage, in this re&s;pect, in being in his external covenant. &mdash;And</P>
<P N="3">3. As to <HI>the influences of the &s;pirit, whereby the means of grace are rendered effectual to the &s;alvation of &s;inners,</HI> he holds, that no unconverted man has a covenat right to them; but that <HI>God hath mercy on whom he will have mercy:</HI> and has been at the pains to publi&s;h a laboured &s;ermon on the &s;ubeject, to prove the point, and to an&s;wer objections; which was printed but &s;ix years ago. And if this be true, the bapti|zed cannot claim a covenant-right to the&s;e influences of the &s;pirit, any more than the unbaptized. And therefore, altho' in the book now under con&s;ideration, p. 59, 60, he &s;ays, <Q>a child dedicated to God in bapti&s;m is thereby bro't into covenant with God, and has a promi&s;e left to it, of the means of grace, and the flrivings of the Spirit, in order to render them effectual for &s;alvation: But an un|baptized child is left in the kingdom of darkne&s;s;</Q> yet it is true, on his own &s;cheme, that &s;uch a baptized child, while in a Chri&s;tle&s;s &s;tate, is under the wrath of God, the cur&s;e of the law, a child of the devil and an heir of hell, and is dependant on God's &s;overeign mercy, as really as any other child. Yea, he declares, in his &s;ermon on <HI>Divine &s;o|vereignty,</HI> p. 5, 6. that, <Q>&s;ometimes tho&s;e who to an eye of rea&s;on are the mo&s;t likely to partake of the ble&s;&s;ings of the go&s;pel are pa&s;&s;ed by; and others of whom we have little or no hope, are recovered by Sovereign Grace, and enriched with Saving Mercy. Thus we &s;hould have thought, Judas, who was one of Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples, and his con&s;tant follower, was more likely to obtain the ble&s;|&s;ing of &s;aving mercy than Saul, who was a fierce, zealous and open enemy to Chri&s;t: but we &s;ee God ordered it otherwi&s;e." And he adds, p. 7. "this was not a thing peculiar to that generation: but it is the Sovereign Grace of God, by which, any one, at any time, is brought to obey the truth to the &s;aving of his &s;oul.</Q></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="77" REF="011174_0047_0F85800BE72F76B0">4. As to the advantage of church di&s;cipline, Mr. M. grants, what every body knows to be too true, that the bap|tized are taken no more care of, generally, than the un|baptized. p. 56. Nor will it mend the matter, if we &s;hould all embrace Mr. M's &s;cheme, and fill up our churches more and more with ungodly men. For go&s;pel di&s;cipline never was, and never will be maintained by ungo&s;pel churches. For &s;o long as men are them&s;elves at heart enemies to the religion of Chri&s;t, it's doctrines and duties, they will not them&s;elves be cordially &s;ubject to it's doctrines and duties; much le&s;s join heartily to bring <HI>others</HI> to be in &s;ubjection to them. As it is written, Mat. 7.16, 17. <HI>Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thi&s;tles? Even &s;o every good tree bring|eth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth corrupt fruit.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. Nor are his ideas of the &s;eals of the covenant any more con&s;i&s;tent.&mdash;For,</P>
<P>His notion of a &s;eal is, that it is a rite of confirmation, whereby, in a mutual covenant, both parties bind them|&s;elves, to comply with the covenant contained in the written in&s;trument. But he grants, that in the written in&s;trument, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, the covenant of grace is contained, and is the principal thing, and yet, by &s;ealing this in&s;trument, we do not pretend to a compliance with the covenant of grace in our own con&s;ciences, or profe&s;s any &s;uch thing be|fore the world. Nay, we do not profe&s;s to have, in the lowe&s;t degree, a heart to comply with it, nor mean that the act of &s;ealing &s;hould have this import; altho' in all other matters execpt tho&s;e of religion; this is what is meant by ing. But in&s;tead of a compliance with the covenant of grace, which is the principal thing, according to him, con|tained in the written in&s;trument, we only profe&s;s a com|pliance with his gracele&s;s covenant, and bind our&s;elves to &s;uch religious exerci&s;es and endeavours, as are con&s;i&s;tent with a total rejection of the covenant of grace in our hearts: even &s;uch a total rejection, as God threatens with eternal dam|nation. p. 36, 37. But of this, we have &s;poken before. <HI>Sect.</HI> V.</P>
<P>Thus incon&s;i&s;tent are Mr. M's notions of his external co|venant,
<PB N="78" REF="011174_0048_0F85800DC7645580">
it's conditions, it's peculiar privileges and it's &s;eals.</P>
<P>To mention but one incon&s;i&s;tence more in Mr. M's &s;cheme: The external covenant, is, according to him, the appointed <HI>means;</HI> and &s;aving faith and conver&s;ion, or a com|pliance with the covenant of grace is the <HI>end.</HI> p. 10, 11. And yet he &s;ays, p. 8. <Q>Altho' a per&s;on was in a &s;tate of grace, and was con&s;equently included in the covenant of grace, yet this covenant remained to be complied with: Abra|ham was a true believer before, yet he mu&s;t needs be cir|cumci&s;ed.</Q> But if Abraham was converted and ju&s;tified before he was circumci&s;ed, then circumci&s;ion was not in&s;ti|tuted as a means of his conver&s;ion, or as a prerequi&s;ite to his ju&s;tification. Mr. M. adds, p. 12. that his external grace|le&s;s covenant is al&s;o to be a means <Q>to train up believers in holine&s;s.</Q>&mdash;That is, holy Abraham, in&s;tead of tho&s;e holy exerci&s;es in which he had lived above 20 years, even ever &s;ince he began a holy life, was in Gen. 17. by God Almigh|ty laid under covenant bonds, to enter into a cour&s;e of un|holy religious exerci&s;es, &s;uch as take place in impenitent &s;elf-righteous &s;inners, to the end that he might "be trained up in holine&s;s." Gal. 3.3. <HI>Are ye &s;o fooli&s;h? having begun in the &s;pirit, are ye now made perfect by the fle&s;h?</HI> Be&s;ides,</P>
<P>That believers &s;hould be under the bonds of two cove|nants, of a nature as contrary and incon&s;i&s;tent, as &s;in and ho|line&s;s, is what cannot be made to hang together.&mdash;And to &s;ay, that this external covenant is neither &s;inful nor holy, is, either, to &s;ay, that there is a whole &s;y&s;tem of religious exer|ci&s;es of heart, which are neither conformable nor uncon|formable with the holy law of God: which is to deny, that the law of God is a univer&s;al rule of life, contrary to the whole tenor of &s;cripture. Gal. 3.10. Mat. 22.37&mdash;40. 1 Cor. 10.31. Or, which is equally ab&s;urd, to &s;ay, that no exerci&s;e of heart is required in his external covenant; no|thing but bodily motions, unconnected with the heart.</P>
<P>Indeed, the very notion of two rules of duty, a holy, and an unholy one, which is e&s;&s;ential to his notion of two cove|nants, is an incon&s;i&s;tence. For two contrary laws, in&s;tead of binding, both at once, mu&s;t mutually de&s;troy each other,
<PB N="79" REF="011174_0048_0F85800DC7645580">
and can, neither of them, bind to any thing.&mdash;That law which is <HI>a &s;chool ma&s;ter to bring us to Chri&s;t,</HI> requires &s;inle&s;s perfection on pain of eternal damnation. Compare Gal. 3.24. with ver&s;e 10.</P>
<P>And thus I have fini&s;hed the remarks, which I de&s;ign to make on Mr. <HI>Mather</HI>'s book. There are other things con|tained in it equally exceptionable; but if his external cove|nant, which is the foundation of his whole &s;cheme is prov|ed to be an un&s;criptural and incon&s;i&s;tent thing, his whole &s;cheme is &s;ufficiently confuted. Be&s;ides, while the whole controver&s;y is reduced to one &s;ingle point, the common peo|ple will be under better advantages to make a judgment for them&s;elves. But now the only point which the reader has to determine, in order to &s;ettle the whole Controver&s;y, in his own mind, is this, viz. <HI>Are bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper &s;eals of the covenant of grace, or of a gracele&s;s covenant?</HI></P>

<P>LET it be remembered, that "the <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> confe&s;&s;ion of faith," which is adopted by the church of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and the <HI>Savoy</HI> confe&s;&s;ion of faith," which is adopted by the churches in the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets</HI> and in <HI>Connecticut;</HI> declare that "&s;acraments are holy &s;igns &amp; &s;eals of the covenant of grace." And let it be remembered, that the&s;e confe&s;&s;ions of faith know nothing of Mr. M's <HI>external gracele&s;s covenant,</HI> either name or thing. And let it al&s;o be remembered, that "the heads of agreement" which were a&s;&s;ented to in <HI>England</HI> in the la&s;t century, by tho&s;e called <HI>Pre&s;byterians</HI> &amp; <HI>Congregationali&s;ts,</HI> and which are adopted by the churches in <HI>Connecticut,</HI> declare, <Q>that none &s;hall be admitted as members, in order to com|munion in all the &s;pecial ordinances of the go&s;pel, but &s;uch per&s;ons, as are knowing and &s;ound in the fundamen|tal doctrine of the chri&s;tian religion, without &s;candal in their lives; and to a judgment regulated by the word of God, are per&s;ons of vi&s;ible holine&s;s and hone&s;ty, <HI>credibly profe&s;&s;ing cordial &s;ubjection to Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></Q> <HI>Ezek.</HI> 44.9. <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.10.&mdash;And further, let it be remembered, that this is the plan, on which, the&s;e churches are profe&s;&s;edly founded.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="011174_0049_0F85800DE1514FE8">For the general council at <HI>Say-Brook,</HI> A. D. 1708, came unanimou&s;ly into this re&s;ult, viz. <Q>As we a&s;&s;ent to the foregoing <HI>heads of agreement,</HI> &s;o we unanimou&s;ly re&s;olve as the Lord &s;hall enable us to practice according to them.</Q></P>
<P>Now the que&s;tion is, whether this plan is agreeable to the word of God, or not. For we are all agreed, that the word of God is the only &s;tandard by which all creeds and con|fe&s;&s;ions, of human compo&s;ure, are to be tried. Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> has offered what he thought proper on the one &s;ide, and I have offered what to me appears needful on the other, and now it belongs to ever reader to judge for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>And now, therefore, Oh, reader, as this grand and im|portant que&s;tion, in which thy &s;oul is deeply intere&s;ted, as well as the &s;ouls of many thou&s;ands of others, is referred to thee, that thou maye&s;t make a judgment for thy&s;elf, &s;o I <HI>intreat thee, before God, and the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the elect angels,</HI> who are &s;pectators in this controver&s;y, to &s;et a&s;ide all carnal affections and worldly con&s;iderations, and to view the whole in the light of God's holy word, and to make up a judgment for thy&s;elf, as in the pre&s;ence of God, and with the &s;ame uprightne&s;s and impartiality, as tho' the la&s;t trum|pet was to &s;ound on the morrow, concerning this que&s;tion, viz. <HI>Whether bapti&s;m and the Lord's-&s;upper are &s;eals of the co|venant of grace, or of a gracele&s;s covenant?</HI> For on this &s;ingle point turns the whole controver&s;y.&mdash;And now may God Almighty, the Father of lights, grant unto thee a di&s;cern|ing mind and a &s;ound judgment, of his infinite mercy thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t. AMEN.</P>
