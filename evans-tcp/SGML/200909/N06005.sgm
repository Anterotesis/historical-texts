<P><HI>_ISRAEL</HI> were upon their March to the promi&s;ed Land; and notwith&s;tanding the wonderful Di&s;plays of divine Power, they had been Witne&s;&s;es of, both in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and in the Wilderne&s;s; and notwith&s;tand|ing the Succe&s;s of their important En|terprize depended intirely on the Ble&s;&s;ing of God; yet they fell into the Sin of Idolatry, than which nothing could have been more hateful. God was ju&s;tly incens'd again&s;t them, and te&s;tified his Di&s;plea&s;ure by the Death of three Thou&s;and of them in one Day, as the forego|ing Chapter informs us.</P>
<P>But tho' they were unmindful of their Duty to God, God was not unmindful of his Promi&s;e. In the three fir&s;t Ver&s;es of the Context, we have an Account of his &s;aying to
<PB N="6" REF="007615_0004_102BA97726E28378">
<HI>Mo&s;es; Depart and go up hence, thou and the People, which thou ha&s;t brought up out of the Land of</HI> Egypt, <HI>unto the Land, which I &s;wear unto</HI> Abraham, <HI>to</HI> I&s;aac, <HI>and to</HI> Jacob, <HI>&s;aying, Unto thy Seed will I give it; and I will &s;end an Angel before thee; and I will drive out the</HI> Canaanite, <HI>the</HI> Amorite, <HI>and the</HI> Perizzite, <HI>the</HI> Hivite, <HI>and the</HI> Jebu&s;ite: <HI>unto a Land flowing with Milk and Honey.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Tho' God determin'd to give them the Land He had promi&s;ed; yet He would bring about the Event by the Interpo&s;ition of an Angel, le&s;t, if there &s;hould be any extraordinary Tokens of His Pre&s;ence, their Sins, being aggravated by the Favour and Honour done them, &s;hould provoke Him to cut them off.</P>
<P>The People having humbled them&s;elves for the Tokens of God's Di&s;plea&s;ure; putting off their Orna|ments&mdash;ri&s;ing up and wor&s;hipping, every Man at his Tent Door, when they &s;aw the cloudy Pillar &s;tanding at the Tabernacle Door: And <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> having got near to God, even to His Seat, thus pleads with Him, 12 and 13 of the Context, <HI>Thou &s;aye&s;t unto me, bring up this People: and thou ha&s;t not let me know whom thou wilt &s;end with me. Yet thou ha&s;t &s;aid, I know thee by Name, thou ha&s;t al&s;o found Grace in my Sight. Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found Grace in thy Sight, &s;hew me now thy Way, that I may know thee, that I may find Grace in thy Sight: and con&s;ider that this Nation is thy People.</HI></P>
<P>God &s;aid, in An&s;wer to this Reque&s;t of <HI>Mo&s;es: My Pre&s;ence &s;hall go with thee, and I will give thee Re&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Then we have <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s Reply to God: <HI>If thy Pre|&s;ence go not with me, carry us not up hence.</HI>&mdash;Which Expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;hews, that he was &s;en&s;ible of the va&s;t Importance of having the Pre&s;ence of God with them in their War again&s;t the <HI>Canaanites.</HI> Oh, that every Commander of an Army, and all other Officers, and all
<PB N="7" REF="007615_0005_102BA9950389CAD0">
that belong to Armies; yea that all, were as &s;en&s;ible of the Importance of the divine Pre&s;ence, as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was, and did as earne&s;tly &s;eek it!</P>
<P>In &s;peaking from the Words, I &s;hall fir&s;t endeavour to &s;hew what it is to have the Pre&s;ence of God with us, in the Sen&s;e of the Text.</P>
<P N="2">2. Shew the Importance of an Army's having the Pre&s;ence of God with them, in their Enterprizes again&s;t their Enemies.</P>
<P N="3">3. Shew, when we may on good Grounds hope for the Pre&s;ence of God with us, in our Enterprizes again&s;t our Enemies. Then make Application relative to the Occa&s;ion of our pre&s;ent Meeting.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> What is it to have the Pre&s;ence of God with us, in the Sen&s;e of the Text? <HI>And He &s;aid, My Pre&s;ence &s;hall go with thee, and I will give thee Re&s;t. And He &s;aid unto Him, If thy Pre&s;ence go not with me, carry us not up hence.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. We mu&s;t not under&s;tand by the Phra&s;e in the Text, that God is not e&s;&s;entially pre&s;ent every where. He fills Heaven and Earth with his Pre&s;ence. There is no fleeing from His Pre&s;ence. Let us be where we will, in what State &s;oever, or doing what we will, God is pre&s;ent. How could we exi&s;t; how could we be; if God were not pre&s;ent to uphold us? Rea&s;on and Scripture teach us the Omnipre&s;ence of God.</P>
<P>Nor,</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Mu&s;t we under&s;tand by the Phra&s;e in the Text, God's being pre&s;ent with a People to ruin and de&s;troy them. As we read in the 5th Ver&s;e of the Context, <HI>I will come up in the mid&s;t of thee in a Moment, and con&s;ume thee.</HI> When there are extraordinary Di&s;plays of divine Power for the Ruin of a People, God may be &s;aid to be pre&s;ent, as well as when there are ex|traordinary Di&s;plays of Power for their Benefit. We read of De&s;truction from His Pre&s;ence.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="007615_0006_102BA97A2145E220">But God's Pre&s;ence going with His People is a Ble&s;|&s;ing, promi&s;ed as &s;uch: God's giving Re&s;t is coupled with his Pre&s;ence going with them. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> prays, that God would not carry them from thence, if He did not go with them. The Pre&s;ence of God for their De&s;truction would not have been de&s;irable. That is the mo&s;t terrible De&s;truction, that is from the immedi|ate Hand of God.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. By God's Pre&s;ence with us, in the Sen&s;e of the Text, is meant his favourable a&s;&s;i&s;ting Pre&s;ence. God's being pre&s;ent with a Per&s;on or People, in any Affair they are engag'd in, notes his Concurrence, Di|rection, and Ble&s;&s;ing in that Affair&mdash;as has been already ob&s;erved: God's Pre&s;ence going with them is promis'd as a Ble&s;&s;ing; giving them Re&s;t is coupled with it.&mdash; It is promi&s;ed to <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> becau&s;e he had found Grace in God's Sight, 17th Ver&s;e of the Context&mdash;and <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> in pleading with God, &s;ays in the 16th Ver&s;e. <HI>For wherein &s;hall it be known here, that I and thy People have found Grace in thy Sight? Is it not that thou goe&s;t with us? &s;o &s;hall we be &s;eparated, I and thy Peo|ple, from all the People that are upon the Face of the Earth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mo&s;es</HI> here &s;eems to repre&s;ent the Pre&s;ence of God going with them, as a Characteri&s;tick, or di&s;tingui&s;hing Mark of God's People: indeed it is the mo&s;t demon|&s;trative one to Pagan Nations.</P>
<P>Wi&s;hing God to be with a Per&s;on, or People, was a very u&s;ual Form of Ble&s;&s;ing among the <HI>Jews:</HI> It was the &s;ame, as wi&s;hing them well, wi&s;hing them Succe&s;s, and Pro&s;|perity. Thus <HI>Saul</HI> ble&s;&s;ed <HI>David,</HI> when he had inti|mated his Mind to attack <HI>Goliah. Go and the Lord be with you,</HI> i. e. &s;ucceed, and ble&s;s you, in your Attempt. 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 17.37. It was a frequent apo&s;tolic Benediction. 2 <HI>The&s;&s;.</HI> 3.16. <HI>The Lord &s;o with you all.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="007615_0007_102BA9978BD19AB0">It was not uncommon to encourage to great Under|takings with this Con&s;ideration, that God was with them. Thus God encourages <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> to go again&s;t <HI>Canaan,</HI> by telling him, He would be with him, there|fore he might be of good Courage, he &s;hould bring the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> there, <HI>Deut.</HI> 31.6, 7, 8, 23. <HI>Jo&s;h.</HI> 1.5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Thus God incourages <HI>Gideon</HI> to go again&s;t the <HI>Midianites. I will be with thee, and thou &s;halt &s;mite the</HI> Midianites <HI>as one Man.</HI> Judges 6.12.16. And thus the Prie&s;ts were to encourage the People of the <HI>Jews,</HI> when they were going to Battle. Deut. 20.1, 2, 3, 4. <HI>When thou goe&s;t out to Battle again&s;t thine Enemies, and &s;ee&s;t Hor&s;es and Chariots, and a People more than thou, be not afraid of them, for the Lord thy God is with thee, which brought thee up out of the Land of Egypt. And it &s;hall be, when ye are come nigh unto the Battle, that the Prie&s;t &s;hall approach and &s;peak unto the People, and &s;hall &s;ay unto them; hear, O I&s;rael, you approach this Day unto Battle again&s;t your Enemies: let not your Heart faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye terrified becau&s;e of them. For the Lord your God is He that goeth with you, to fight for you again&s;t your Enemies.</HI></P>
<P>And wherever we read of God's being with a Per|&s;on or People, we read of their Pro&s;perity and Succe&s;s. It is &s;aid of <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> 2 Chron. 18.7. <HI>And the Lord was with him, and he pro&s;per'd whither&s;oever he went forth: and he rebell'd again&s;t</HI> (or &s;hook off the Yoke of) <HI>the King of</HI> A&s;&s;yria, <HI>and &s;erved him not. And &s;mote the</HI> Phili&s;tines <HI>even unto</HI> Gaza, <HI>and the Borders there|of, from the Tower of the Watchmen to the fenced City.</HI> From the&s;e Things it is evident, that by the Pre&s;ence of God going with us in any important Enterprizes, in the Sen&s;e of the Text, is meant his Direction, Concur|rence and Ble&s;&s;ing. But according to the propos'd Method, I am,</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="007615_0008_102BA97BA3110530"><HI>Secondly,</HI> To repre&s;ent the Importance of having the Pre&s;ence of God with an Army, in Enterprizes again&s;t their Enemies.</P>
<P><HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> &s;en&s;ible of the Importance of it, deprecates the want of it. <HI>If thy Pre&s;ence go not with me, carry us not up hence.</HI></P>
<P>To have God with us, is the &s;ame as to have God for us; if God be for us, if God is on our Side, we need not care who is again&s;t us. Let them be ever &s;o many or mighty, there is more with us, than with them. Thus <HI>Hezekiah</HI> incourages his People again&s;t their Ene|mies, from the Confidence he had, that the Lord was them, 2 Chron. 32.7, 8. Ver&s;es. <HI>Be &s;trong and coura|geous, be not afraid for the King of</HI> A&s;&s;yria, <HI>nor for all the Multitude that is with him: for there be more with us, than with him; with him is an Arm of Fle&s;h, but with us is the Lord our God to help us, and to fight our Battles.</HI> Though an Army be ever &s;o numerous and &s;trong, their Power is limited, and finite, whereas God's Power is unbounded and infinite. So that an Army, tho' &s;mall, that has the Pre&s;ence of God with them, is more formidable, and dreadful than the huge&s;t Ho&s;t, that ever was rais'd, that has not the Pre&s;ence of God with them. God is the Lord of all the Ho&s;ts in Hea|ven and Earth. He has all Things at his Command. Our mo&s;t avowed Enemies can do nothing again&s;t us, but what God permits, and allows them; and we have no Rea&s;on to fear, if God's Pre&s;ence is with us, that He will permit them to do much again&s;t us; but rather have Rea&s;on to hope that He will be again&s;t our Ene|mies, an Adver&s;ary to our Adver&s;aries; that our Af|fairs will be under the be&s;t Direction; that there will be a Concurrence of favourable Circum&s;tances on our Behalf.</P>
<P>God's Pre&s;ence with an Army going again&s;t their Enemies will be a Remedy again&s;t Fear. We are not
<PB N="11" REF="007615_0009_102BA9990FFCDD70">
made without Fear: and the confu&s;ed Noi&s;e of the Warrior, and Garments roll'd in Blood, will be apt to excite Fear. Fear, as it were, binds Mens Hands, is a Bar to noble, and heroic Actions. But a Per&s;ua&s;ion, that God is with them, is a good Antidote again&s;t Fear. God often u&s;es this Argument to conquer the Fear of his People, in Ca&s;es of Difficulty and Danger, Thus He did with <HI>Jo&s;hua. Deut.</HI> 31.6.8. <HI>Jo&s;h.</HI> 1.9.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Syria</HI> &s;ent an Army large enough to compa&s;s a City, only to &s;eize the Prophet <HI>Eli&s;ha:</HI> his Servant, when he &s;aw it, feared, and was ready to think it was a gone Ca&s;e. <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI> told him not to fear, for they that be with us, are more than they that be with them. He prayed that God would open his Eyes, and when his Eyes were opened, his Fears vani&s;hed. <HI>Eli&s;ha,</HI> by the Help of God, took that whole Army Captive, and led them into <HI>Samaria.</HI> 2 Kings 6.14&mdash;20.</P>
<P>If we knew we had greater Strength, greater Wi&s;|dom, greater Advantages on all Accounts than our Ene|mies, would not Fear be unrea&s;onable: if an Hun|dred Men were going again&s;t one Man, would not their fearing be an Argument of a ba&s;e low Spirit. One Man's Strength and Wi&s;dom bears &s;ome Proportion to the Power and Wi&s;dom of an Hundred; but the Power, and Policy of the greate&s;t Army bears no Proportion to the Power and Wi&s;dom of God, which is infinite. If God therefore be with us, we need not fear. <HI>David,</HI> in an Addre&s;s to God, &s;ays, <HI>P&s;alm.</HI> 23. <HI>Though I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death</HI> (which a hot Engagement has &s;ome Re&s;emblance of) <HI>I will fear no Evil, for thou art with me, thy Rod and thy Staff &s;hall comfort me.</HI></P>
<P>The Pre&s;ence of God with an Army, in&s;pires with Courage. It not only expels Fear, but fills with Cou|rage. As our Fears will encourage our Enemies, &s;o Courage will di&s;hearten them. Courage gives Life to
<PB N="12" REF="007615_0010_102BA97D9F859098">
Strength, which would be in a Manner u&s;ele&s;s, if we dur&s;t not exert and put it forth. Courage a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Strength, and directed by Wi&s;dom, is often the Spring of glorious Atchievements&mdash; And what has a greater Ten|dency to in&s;pire with Courage, than to be per&s;waded on good Grounds, that God is with us. This is an Argu|ment which God u&s;es to excite Courage, <HI>Deut.</HI> 31, 6, 7, 23, Ver. <HI>Jo&s;h.</HI> 1.6, 9, Ver. What more &s;uitable Ar|gument can there be, when we think of the Perfections of God?</P>
<P>When it is apparent that God is pre&s;ent with an Ar|my, their Enemies will be filled with Fear. <HI>Let us flee</HI> (&s;aid the <HI>Egyptians) from the Face of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>for the Lord fighteth for them again&s;t the</HI> Egyptians, Exod. 14.25.&mdash; <HI>When the</HI> Phili&s;tines <HI>under&s;tood that the Ark of God was come into the Camp, they were afraid, for they &s;aid, God is come into the Camp. And they &s;aid, Wo unto us; for there hath not been &s;uch a Thing here|tofore. Wo unto us, Who &s;hall deliver us out of the Hands of the&s;e mighty Gods? The&s;e are the Gods that &s;mote the</HI> Egyptians <HI>with Plagues in the Wilderne&s;s,</HI> 1 Sam. 4.6, 7, 8, Ver. The Pre&s;ence of God is a Pillar of Fire to direct and guide his People; and a Pillar of the Cloud to confound his Enemies.</P>
<P>If God is with an Army in an Enterprize, they have Rea&s;on to expect Succe&s;s. We have <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> &s;aying, Chap. 14.12. <HI>Thou hearde&s;t in that Day how the</HI> Ana|kims <HI>were there, and that their Cities were great and fenced; if &s;o be the Lord be with me, I &s;hall be able to drive them out.</HI> And they may &s;ay to tho&s;e that attack them, as in 2 Chron. 35.21. <HI>Forbear from meddling with God, who is with me, that He de&s;troy you not.</HI> And thus may they bid Defiance to their Enemies, as in I&s;a. 8.9, 10. Ver. <HI>A&s;&s;ociate your &s;elves, O ye People, and ye &s;hall be broken in Pieces; and give Ear, all ye of far Countries: Gird your &s;elves, and ye &s;hall be broken
<PB N="13" REF="007615_0011_102BA99B387EA198">
in Pieces; gird your &s;elves, and ye &s;hall be broken in Pieces. Take Coun&s;el together, and it &s;hall come to nought; &s;peak the Word, and it &s;hall not &s;tand: for God is with us.</HI> See what A&s;&s;urance an Army, that hath the Pre&s;ence of God going with them, hath of Succe&s;s. Zech. 10.5. <HI>And they &s;hall be as mighty Men, which tread down their Enemies, in the Mire of the Street in the Battle, and they &s;hall fight becau&s;e the Lord is with them.</HI>&mdash; Numb. 14.9. <HI>Only rebel not ye again&s;t the Lord, neither fear ye the People of the Land; for they are Bread for us: Their Defence is departed from them; the Lord is with us, fear them not.</HI></P>
<P>If God be with us, it will di&s;po&s;e others to an Agree|ment with us. It made <HI>Abimeleck,</HI> tho' a King, &s;eek the Alliance and Friend&s;hip of <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>I&s;aac, Gen.</HI> 21.28. and 26.28. Ver. We read 2 Chron. 15.9. <HI>That they fell to</HI> A&s;a, <HI>King of</HI> Judah, <HI>in Abundance, out of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>the revolted Tribes, when they &s;aw that God was with him.</HI>&mdash; And Zech. 8.23. <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts, In tho&s;e Days it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, that ten Men &s;hall take hold out of all Languages of the Nations, even &s;hall take hold of the Skirt of him that is a</HI> Jew, <HI>&s;aying, We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you.</HI> Once more,</P>
<P>If God be with us, we may on good Grounds, expect a Freedom from a great Variety of Evils. See Ezekiel 34.30. The Prophet having enumerated a Variety of Evils they &s;hould be freed from, and a Variety of Ble&s;|&s;ings they &s;hould be the Subjects of, &s;ays, <HI>Thus &s;hall they know that I the Lord their God am with them, and that they, even the Hou&s;e of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>are my People, &s;aith the Lord God.</HI></P>
<P>But if we have not an Exemption from Evils, we &s;hall be carried &s;afely thro' them. I&s;a. 43.2. <HI>When thou pa&s;&s;e&s;t thro' the Waters, I will be with thee; and thro' the Rivers, they &s;hall not overflow thee: When
<PB N="14" REF="007615_0012_102BA97F9C8C3658">
thou walke&s;t through the Fire, thou &s;halt not be burnt; neither &s;hall the Flames kindle upon thee.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Things are &s;ufficient to &s;how the Importance of having God with us. It is of more Importance, than to have the greate&s;t Number of the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t pow|erful Men. I dye, &s;aid <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> but the Lord will be with you, which is of more Importance to you, tho' he had born great Sway at the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Court, and God had made him an In&s;trument of great Good to them.&mdash; Men are ready to think, that in War, their Safety depends on Numbers. We tru&s;t too much to an Arm of Fle&s;h. Nothing is of equal Importance to having the Pre&s;ence of God with us. We read, Deut. 32.30. <HI>How &s;hould one cha&s;e a Thou&s;and, and two put Ten Thou&s;and to Flight, except their Rock had &s;old them, and the Lord had &s;hut them up?</HI></P>
<P>But on the other Hand, If God is not with us, we have Rea&s;on to fear a Series of mo&s;t di&s;mal Events. As God's Pre&s;ence with us, is a very &s;ignal Ble&s;&s;ing, &s;o God's not being with us, or for&s;aking us, is a mo&s;t terrible Evil, deprecated by tho&s;e, who, with <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> knew the Impor|tance of having God's Pre&s;ence with them. If God is not with a People, they are expo&s;ed to become a Prey to their Enemies, See 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 21.14. <HI>Judges</HI> 6.13. <HI>Jer.</HI> 12.7.23.39, 40. How &s;en&s;ible <HI>Saul</HI> was of his Calamity, in being without the Pre&s;ence of God, appears from that Lamentation, 1 Sam. 28.15. <HI>I am &s;ore di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed, the</HI> Phili&s;tines <HI>make War on me, and God is de|parted from me.</HI>&mdash;Having &s;hown the Importance of hav|ing the Pre&s;ence of God with us in Enterprizes again&s;t our Enemies; I proceed,</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> To &s;how the Way to have God's Pre&s;ence go with us&mdash; To know the Importance of having the Pre|&s;ence of God with us, will be of no Service to us, if we never knew how to obtain it: but &s;ince there is a Way to obtain it, which may be known; to know of what Im|portance it is, may engage us to &s;eek it.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="007615_0013_102BA99CD8089298">People may conclude He is with them, when He is not, on Account of &s;ome religious Privileges they are di&s;tingui&s;hed by, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 13.12. And may conclude God is not with them, when He is, on Account of &s;ome adver&s;e Providences, <HI>Judges</HI> 6.13.</P>
<P>We may on good Grounds hope for the Pre&s;ence of God with us.&mdash;If we are contrite or patient; if we &s;ee our Sins; are &s;o griev'd for them as to turn from them to God. God dwells with the Contrite.</P>
<P N="2">2. We may on good Grounds hope for the Pre&s;ence of God with us, when we be with Him. 2 Chron. 15.2. <HI>Hear ye me,</HI> A&s;a, <HI>and all</HI> Judah, <HI>and</HI> Benjamin, <HI>the Lord is with you, while ye be with him.</HI> You &s;ee that it is here promi&s;ed to <HI>A&s;a,</HI> That if he would be with God, God would be with him. No Scripture is of private Interpretation. If we are with God, we may be incou|raged to hope that God will be with us, from this Pro|mi&s;e, tho' it was particularly applyed to <HI>A&s;a,</HI> and his Subjects: It was recorded and handed down for our Direction and Encouragement. But now our Inquiry may be, What it is to be with God? This is a Phra&s;e that is u&s;ed &s;ometimes to expre&s;s the Happine&s;s of the Saints, in the future World. <HI>So &s;hall we be ever with the Lord,</HI> 1 The&s;&s;. 4. ult. But this is not the Idea that is convey'd by the Phra&s;e, in the Pa&s;&s;age under Con&s;i|deration.</P>
<P>But the being with God, to which God's being with us is promi&s;ed, implies in it.</P>
<P N="1">1. A Reconciliation with God through Chri&s;t. How can two walk together, except they be agreed? In Or|der to be with God, there mu&s;t therefore be a laying down the Weapons of our Rebellion, and returning to Him, on the Act of Grace which He has i&s;&s;ued, wherein He has promi&s;ed Pardon to tho&s;e that believe and repent and return to Him&mdash;We were Enemies to God
<PB N="16" REF="007615_0014_102BA981A9CA7898">
by wicked Works: When we come to be with God, the Enmity is &s;lain by the Blood of Chri&s;t, and from Enemies we come to be Friends.</P>
<P N="2">2. Being with God, to which God's being with us is promi&s;ed, is a being for God, on the Side of God. If we are at War with a People, when we &s;ay&mdash;&s;uch are with us&mdash;We mean, they are on our Side; This Idea is conveyed 2 Chron. 32.7.8. <HI>There be more with us, than with them,</HI> i. e. there are more on our Side, than on theirs.</P>
<P>There is a War between God and Sin: To be with God, is to be again&s;t Sin in our&s;elves and others. As a People &s;eek the utter Ruin and De&s;truction of tho&s;e they are at War with; &s;o tho&s;e, that are with God, &s;eek the utter Ruin and De&s;truction of Sin, mortify it, and crucify it. They that are Chri&s;t's, crucify the Affec|tions and Lu&s;ts. They that are with God, reprove Sin in others, u&s;e their Influence to &s;uppre&s;s it, exert them|&s;elves in their re&s;pective Spheres again&s;t it, implore the Help of God again&s;t it.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Being with God, to which God's being with us is promi&s;ed, means a promoting His Cau&s;e, and ad|vancing His Glory. Tho&s;e that are heartily with God, again&s;t Sin in them&s;elves and others, will be with God in promoting a Conformity to His Mind and Will in them&s;elves and others. That which influences us to exert our&s;elves for the Suppre&s;&s;ion of Sin, will influ|ence us to exert our&s;elves for promoting a Conformity to God. If the End of our Actions is right, our Zeal in promoting a Conformity to God, will be in Propor|tion to our Zeal again&s;t Sin. If we are with God in this Re&s;pect, &s;ee what Encouragement we have to hope that God will be with us, 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 18.4, 5, 6, 7. <HI>He removed the High Places, and brake the Images, and cut down the Groves, and brake in Pieces the brazen Serpent, that</HI> Mo&s;es <HI>had made; for unto tho&s;e Days the

Children of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>did burn Incen&s;e unto it&mdash;He tru&s;ted in the Lord God of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>&s;o that after him, was none like him, among all the Kings of</HI> Judah, <HI>nor any that were before him; for He clave to the Lord, and de|parted not from following him, but kept his Command|ments, which the Lord commanded</HI> Mo&s;es, <HI>and the Lord was with him, &amp;c.</HI> See <HI>Amos</HI> 5.14. <HI>Seek Good and not Evil, that ye may live; and &s;o the Lord, the God of Ho&s;ts will be with you.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Being with God may mean, a being much with Him in Prayer.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, Being with God may mean acting as in His Pre&s;ence. As being with a great Per&s;onage would re|&s;train us from what might di&s;plea&s;e, and di&s;po&s;e us to honour him. So realizing God's Pre&s;ence would be a great Re&s;traint to Sin, and incentive to Duty.</P>

<P N="1">1. Doth God ever vouch&s;afe His Pre&s;ence with a People, in their Enterprizes? Learn his Grace and Con|de&s;cen&s;ion. What an infinite Di&s;tance is there between God and Man? That &s;uch a Being &s;hould direct and guide them in their Enterprizes, argues the Conde&s;cen|&s;ion and Grace of God. We not only read of God's Pre&s;ence with his People, in his Word, but we in this Land have experienced his Pre&s;ence with us, in former important Enterprizes, we have been engag'd in. What Obligations did tho&s;e wonderful Favours, lay us under to love and &s;erve Him? but how doth our Ingratitude and ill-requiting the Lord call for our Humiliation and Aba&s;ement?

it, and the Folly of the contrary. It is the highe&s;t Wi&s;dom to &s;eek the Pre&s;ence of God with us in our Enterprizes. We think it Wi&s;dom, and ju&s;tly too, to have wi&s;e and faithful Per&s;ons, and Per&s;ons of Strength and Courage, engaged in our warlike Enterprizes. How much more &s;o is it to have the Pre&s;ence of God, who is infinitely wi&s;e, true and powerful? If the <HI>Phi|li&s;tines</HI> were imbolden'd to defy the Armies of the living God, becau&s;e they had the Pre&s;ence of the tall Giant of <HI>Gath;</HI> certainly, we may defy the Armies of the uncircumcis'd, if we have the Pre&s;ence of Almighty God with us. As it is a great and invaluable Ble&s;&s;ing to have the Pre&s;ence of God with us, &s;o it is an un|&s;peakable Mi&s;ery to have God for&s;ake us; the greater the Ble&s;&s;ing in having God with us, the greater the Mi&s;ery in being depriv'd of it As it is great Wi&s;dom to &s;eek the Pre&s;ence of God; &s;o it is great Folly to do any Thing to provoke God to for&s;ake us.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now particularly apply my&s;elf to tho&s;e of our Brethren, and Friends, who are engag'd in the Ex|pedition on Foot, and are about to take their Leave of us.</P>
<P><HI>Dear Friends,</HI> Our meeting together in God's Hou&s;e this Day, is occa&s;ioned by you.</P>
<P>I hope enough has been &s;aid to &s;how the Impor|tance of having the Pre&s;ence of God going with you, and to excite your De&s;ires after it.</P>
<P>The Cau&s;e, you are engaged in, is undoubtedly good. Our Rights have been unju&s;tly invaded. Lands ceded to us in the mo&s;t &s;olemn Treaties have been incroach'd on. We have Rea&s;on to fear, that if our Enemies meet with no Check, we &s;hall not only be di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;t, but in&s;lav'd Body and Soul&mdash; The Blood of our Friends hath been mo&s;t cruelly &s;pilt in Times of profound Peace.&mdash;We have been hindred extending our Settlements on Lands, our Enemies don't pretend to

di&s;pute our Right to&mdash;Settlements have been broken up, People have been driven from their Farms, by which Multitudes of Families have been impoveri&s;hed. &mdash;If a Community may puni&s;h &s;uch Things, in its own Members, (as undoubtedly it may) I don't &s;ee why they may not exert them&s;elves for the Puni&s;hment of another Community, which commits &s;uch Ho&s;tilities again&s;t them. We are to &s;et a greater Value on our Liberties and Priviledges, than tamely to &s;uffer our &s;elves to be depriv'd of them.</P>
<P>The People, you are going again&s;t, are a Limb of that MOTHER OF HARLOTS, whom God has devoted to utter De&s;truction, who&s;e De&s;truction is plainly fore|told in the Word of God&mdash;The <HI>French</HI> Nation, in God's Account, &s;tands chargeable with the Blood of many Saints and Martyrs, which, like the Blood of <HI>Abel,</HI> cries aloud for Vengeance again&s;t them. <HI>How long, O Lord, holy and true, do&s;t thou not judge and avenge our Blood on them that dwell on the Earth.</HI> Rev. 6.9, 10.</P>
<P>God has of late been pouring out the Vials of His Wrath on the Antichri&s;tian States. He has been te&s;ti|fying His Di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t them by tremendous Earthquakes, which we al&s;o have felt in a Degree &s;ufficient to awaken us.

<P>Be concerned, to go to War with Men, at Peace with God: Then whatever may be the Fate of the Army, you are Members of, it will be well with you in particular. Let it be your Concern to be in a State of Favour with God. Your Calling is a dan|gerous Calling, you will be in Deaths oft, as the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> &s;peaks.

<P><PB N="21" REF="007615_0019_102BA9A3E6B10B68">You will, I make no doubt, be &s;en&s;ible of the Im|portance of having God's Pre&s;ence with you, before you return. Many, who never cryed to God in their Lives, will undoubtedly, in the Progre&s;s of this Affair, have &s;uch Apprehen&s;ions, as will put them on crying to God for Help. The I&s;&s;ue, you know, is uncertain; let me intreat you, to &s;et not only your Hou&s;es, but your Souls in Order.</P>
<P>I will leave with you a few Cautions and Directions.</P>
<P N="1">1. Do Violence to no Man. This is what the Bap|ti&s;t &s;aid to the Soldiers, who a&s;k'd him what they mu&s;t do. You may po&s;&s;ibly think, this is a &s;trange Piece of Advice to be given to Soldiers, who are to effect their De&s;igns by Force and Arms. But this, without Di&s;|pute, you may gather from it, that you &s;hould offer no Violence in the Towns of your Friends and Country|men, through which you are to march. Soldiers often take Liberties, at a Di&s;tance from Home, which they would not do at Home. Tho&s;e you are going to de|fend, &s;hould not be in&s;ulted by you: Some I have &s;een march along, have needed this Caution&mdash;Or, this Pa&s;&s;age of <HI>John</HI> may be a Prohibition of fighting with your Fellow-Soldiers&mdash;This Pa&s;&s;age of the Bapti&s;t may be a Caution again&s;t depriving your Country-men, or Fellow-Soldiers, of their Property, violently, or un|ju&s;tly.&mdash;</P>
<P N="2">2. Beware of Drunkenne&s;s. Some may be in Dan|ger of falling into this Vice: This is a bea&s;tly Vice; it transforms a Man into a Bea&s;t&mdash;it expo&s;es a Man to do, and &s;uffer all Manner of Evils in this World, and to inexpre&s;&s;ible Mi&s;ery in the next World.&mdash; It is a Vice that renders very unfit for the Bu&s;ine&s;s of a Soldier. It is a Vice that infeebles and di&s;pirits a Man&mdash; Ho&s;ea 4.11. <HI>Whoredom and Wine take away the Heart.</HI> He that &s;trives for the Ma&s;tery, &s;hould be temperate in all Things.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="22" REF="007615_0020_102BA987D9F04240">3. Beware of profane Swearing. This is a Vice, I apprehend, you will be much expos'd to fall into. <HI>Jo|&s;eph</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> learnt to Swear by the Life of <HI>Pharaoh.</HI> In &s;uch a Concour&s;e of Men, there will be doubtle&s;s many, who will be addicted to this Vice. Men are apt to follow bad Examples&mdash;This Vice gratifys no &s;en&s;ual Appetite&mdash;It is highly provoking to God. I would have you remember your Succe&s;s depends on God: Can you, on good Grounds, hope for Succe&s;s, when you thus di&s;honour Him?</P>
<P N="4">4. Beware of a mutinous Spirit and Di&s;po&s;ition. The Safety of the Army, under God, depends much on their Harmony and good Agreement. If it &s;hould be di|vided again&s;t it&s;elf, it can't &s;tand. The Enemy would have an ea&s;y Conque&s;t&mdash;you would do your Enemies Work for them in a great Mea&s;ure. Therefore let none of you foment Divi&s;ions, nor try to make any unea&s;y, and di&s;contented; but try to promote Concord and Unity: You will have Enemies enough without the Camp: You need not make any in it.</P>
<P N="5">5. Neglect not your Duty in an Engagement, tho' attended with Difficulty and Danger. Don't think it will do to leave the Work to others, while you are <HI>&s;neaking</HI> in &s;ome <HI>Hole.</HI> By &s;uch Conduct you will be unfaithful to your Tru&s;t&mdash;you will defraud the Country of what you receive of them&mdash;you will betray your Fellow-Soldiers; if any of them fall through your wilful Neglect of Duty, I don't &s;ee but their Blood mu&s;t be required at your Hands.&mdash; You will weaken the Army, and expo&s;e it to be overthrown.&mdash;</P>
<P N="6">6. Be much in Prayer. Though you may not have much Opportunity to retire for Prayer, yet be much in ejaculatory Prayer. Let the&s;e Places have Weight with you, Jam. 4.2. <HI>Ye Fight and War, yet ye have not, becau&s;e you a&s;k not. Ye a&s;k, and receive not, becau&s;e ye a&s;k ami&s;s, that ye may con&s;ume it on your Lu&s;ts.</HI> And P&s;al. 91.15.

<P N="7">7. Attend on the publick religious Exerci&s;es of the Army, as often as you have Opportunity; you will be taken off from this often; but let not Sloth or Indi&s;po|&s;ition to it, hinder you.&mdash;</P>
<P>I commend you to God. I pray God to be with you in all the Ways you &s;hall go&mdash;to hold you in the Hollow of his Hand&mdash;to pre&s;erve you amid&s;t all the Dangers you will be expo&s;ed to&mdash;to fit you for the great Work, you are called to do&mdash;to make you In&s;tru|ments of reducing your, and your Countries Enemies&mdash; to return you with Songs of Prai&s;e in your Mouths; and that we and you may rejoice in the happy I&s;&s;ue of this Expedition.&mdash;Above all, That God would make you Overcomers in your &s;piritual Warfare, and intitle you to the Rewards of &s;uch.</P>

<P>And may this whole A&s;&s;embly look on them&s;elves intere&s;ted in the Event of this Expedition.
