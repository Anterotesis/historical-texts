<HEAD>The mo&s;t important QUESTION, CONSIDERED.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>ACTS, xvi. 30, 31.</HI></BIBL>
<P>&mdash;And &s;aid, Sirs, What mu&s;t I do to &s;aved? And they &s;aid, Believe on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and thou &s;halt be &s;aved, and thy Hou&s;e.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AS the great, and true, and I may &s;ay the only valu|able End of all Knowledge, is Practice; even &s;o, right Knowledge is mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, in order to right, and regular Action: The Rea&s;on is, there being in the very Con&s;titution of Things, certain Rules for all Humane Con|duct: Right Action depends upon its Conformity unto them. This is the Ca&s;e in <HI>civil,</HI> or <HI>&s;ecular</HI> Life: We can't talk in a <HI>Foreign,</HI> nor in our own Langue, before we have learnt it. No Man can &s;ail a Ve&s;&s;el into a &s;trange and di&s;tant Port, without the Art of Navigation. No more can any One be a regular Practitioner in <HI>Phy&s;ick,</HI> without &s;ome Ac|quaintance with the My&s;tery thereof.</P>
<P>So it is in the <HI>moral</HI> Life: There mu&s;t be the Knowledge, before there can be the Practice of Religion. <HI>He that cometh to God, mu&s;t believe that he is&mdash;</HI> If we don't know what will be acceptable to God, how can we plea&s;e him? We mu&s;t know the Way, that lends to eternal Life, before we can walk in it. Agreeably thereto, &s;ays <HI>Thomas</HI> to our LORD;</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="008872_0004_103091AB355E9130">"We know not whether thou goe&s;t, and how can we know the Way?"</P>
<P>NOW as this is our main Bu&s;ine&s;s, and highe&s;t Concern to &s;erve GOD in this Life; that &s;o we may partake of his Favour in the next: So it is of equal Importance to us, to under&s;tand and know the Way, and the Manner how to do the one, that we may enjoy the other. For this Purpo&s;e therefore, have I cho&s;en, for the &s;ubject of my pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e, the&s;e Words, <HI>What mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved, Believe on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and thou &s;hall be &s;aved and thy Hou&s;e.</HI> For the under&s;tanding of which, and the per&s;on &s;peaking therein; it may'nt be ami&s;s to con&s;ider the Occa&s;ion, that led the Way, and gave Ri&s;e to them.</P>
<P>AT this Time, <HI>Paul</HI> the Apo&s;tle and <HI>Silas</HI> his fellow Labour|er in the Go&s;pel, were preaching the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of GOD nigh <HI>Phi|lippi,</HI> a chief City in <HI>Macedonia.</HI> And many re&s;orted unto them, among whom was a certain Dam&s;el, who, as we are told was <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a Spirit of Divination, and brought her Ma&s;ter much Gain by Sooth&s;aying.</HI> But this notwith&s;tanding &s;he openly confe&s;s'd, that <HI>the&s;e Men were the Servants of the Mo&s;t High God, which &s;how unto us the Way of Salvation. And this &s;he did many Days.</HI> Where we may ob&s;erve, that the&s;e holy Men, received more Honour, Re&s;pect, and better Treatment, even from one po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Devil, than from that &s;tupid, and &s;inful Peo|ple. And what an ample Reward did &s;he &s;oon recieve there|for! For <HI>Paul being grieved</HI> for her, <HI>turned and &s;aid to the Spi|rit, I command thee in the Name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t to come out of her and he came out the &s;ame Hour.</HI> This made no &s;mall Stir. For her Ma&s;ters, <HI>when they &s;aw that the Hope of their Gain was gone,</HI> were greatly moved.</P>
<P>HOW dear to &s;ome, and near their Hearts, their Money, and worldly Intere&s;t lies! Touch this, and you gall the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the very Quick: Nothing moves them like it. See the Operation! <HI>They</HI> being thus moved; the Populace al&s;o being rai&s;ed: What a mighty Uproar &s;oon followed! They laid violent Hands on the Apo&s;tles; dragged them into the <HI>Marketplace,</HI> and hauling them before the <HI>Magi&s;trates,</HI> brought in a grie|vous Complaint again&s;t them; not for <HI>Murder,</HI> or <HI>Sedition,</HI> or any <HI>enormous</HI> Crime; but being <HI>Jews,</HI> for <HI>teaching Cu&s;toms</HI> un|lawful
<PB N="5" REF="008872_0005_103091AD15CDAE28">
as they &s;aid, for <HI>Romans</HI> to receive; and this, (to &s;ay no wor&s;e of it) was a fal&s;e Charge.</P>
<P>AND yet the Magi&s;trates, not regarding their Per&s;ons, or <HI>Sacred Characters,</HI> or the Dam&s;el's Te&s;timony in their Favour, or the Trivialne&s;s and Fal&s;ity of the Complaint; (all which mu&s;t needs aggravate their Proceedings, except we may &s;up|po&s;e them totally ignorant of the&s;e Things:) but without any Examination, or giving them the lea&s;t Opportunity to defend them&s;elves again&s;t this unreasonable Charge, as we read of, in the mo&s;t inhumane and barbarous Manner, ordered them to be &s;tripped and beaten. And this not &s;lighty; for having <HI>laid many Stripes upon them, they ca&s;t them into Pri&s;on, charging the Jaylor to keep them &s;afely. Who having received &s;uch a Charge, thru&s;t them into the inner Pri&s;on, and made their Feet fa&s;t in the Stocks.</HI> And now he it &s;eems, concluding all Things were &s;afe, commits him&s;elf to his Bed.</P>
<P>HERE &s;ee the pious Devotion, and heavenly Tempers of the&s;e Servants of GOD! notwith&s;anding their hard Treatment in the Day, and &s;o uncomfortable a Lodging, in a filthy Dun|geon at Night; yet they were &s;o far from meditating any Revenge, that <HI>at Midnight they prayed, and &s;ang Prai&s;es to God;</HI> likely that they were counted worthy to &s;uffer for the Name of CHRIST. And Behold the Event! A <HI>Speedy An&s;wer</HI> of their Prayers, and a <HI>Miraculous Deliverance</HI> by a great Earth|quake! By which <HI>the Foundations of the Pri&s;on were Shaken, all the Doors opened, and every ones Bands loo&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Shock, doubtle&s;s, waked the Jaylor out of his Sleep. Who &s;tarting from his Bed in the greate&s;t Fright; it &s;eems, his fir&s;st Thoughts was about the Pri&s;oners; and &s;eeing the Pri&s;on Doors open; probably no Way apprehen&s;ive of the Cau&s;e; but thinking that &s;ome evil minded Per&s;on had made In&s;urrection, broke open the Pri&s;on, delivered the Pri&s;oners, and they were gone, and withall, that he was no ways able to an&s;wer it to the Magi&s;trates: This added to his Surpri&s;e, and put him almo&s;t be&s;ide him&s;elf. In this Confu&s;ion, <HI>He drew his Sword,</HI> and was about to kill him&s;elf, but was pre|vented by <HI>Paul's</HI> crying <HI>with a loud Voice,</HI> DO THYSELF NO HARM; <HI>for we are all here.</HI> This was as much unex|pected, and as great a Surpri&s;e as the former; though in a
<PB N="6" REF="008872_0006_103091AF0FDC3228">
more agreeable Manner. For this brought him to his Sen&s;es again; altered his bloody De&s;ign and wrought upon all his Pa&s;&s;ions: Which by this Time were thrown into &s;uch a Fer|ment and violent Agitation, as cau&s;ed the whole Humane Frame to tremble. And in this <HI>Manner</HI> and <HI>Form,</HI> he ran and threw him&s;elf at the Apo&s;tle's Feet.</P>
<P>NOW it is no ways apparent, that the Jaylor as yet had any Concern about his Soul, or future State; but all this was the natutal Effect of his Surpri&s;e and a Concern about the pre|&s;ent Emergency; though it might greatly &s;erve to prepare the Way for his Reception of the Me&s;&s;ages of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>AFTER this we read of the Jaylor's Que&s;tion, and the Apo&s;|tles An&s;wer; <HI>his</HI> kind Offices to them and <HI>their</HI> preaching to him and his Hou&s;e, the Word of the LORD. But po&s;&s;ibly the&s;e Things are not &s;et down ju&s;t in the &s;ame Order, in which they happened; a Thing common in the Scriptures. For to me it don't look likely, that this Que&s;tion was a&s;ked, or an&s;wered in the Pri&s;on, or while the Jaylor was in his Fright, or in the Beginning of their Conver&s;ation, and before he had &s;ome Information of the Go&s;pel Way of Salvation; for the&s;e were a Heathen People, and mo&s;t likely wholly Stran|gers to the&s;e Things.</P>
<P>AND probably, the whole Affair might be conducted in &s;ome &s;uch Manner as this. When the Jaylor came to the Apo&s;tles; had a little recovered him&s;elf, and &s;aw the Pri&s;on Doors open, the Per&s;ons Bands loo&s;ed; but no Tumult, nor any one gone: It wrought in him &s;ome good Opinion of <HI>the&s;e Men;</HI> that they were not &s;uch <HI>vile Fellows</HI> as before he had conceived them to be. This di&s;po&s;ed him to treat them, in the mo&s;t <HI>courteous</HI> and <HI>ho&s;pitable</HI> Manner; and accord|ingly invited them into his Hou&s;e, ordered <HI>their Stripes to be wa&s;hed,</HI> and <HI>Meat to be &s;et before them.</HI></P>
<P>WHILE this was doing, &s;ome Conver&s;ation would <HI>natural|ly</HI> ari&s;e, and how could it begin more aptly? Than by the Jaylor's enquiring: <Q>How came the&s;e Things to pa&s;s? What was this great Noi&s;e I heard? How came the&s;e Doors open and your Bands all loo&s;ed?</Q></P>
<P>IN An&s;wer to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e Queries&punc; the Apo&s;tle gives him a par|ticular Detail of the whole Affair. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of the Go&s;|pel
<PB N="7" REF="008872_0007_103091B323D5D7E8">
Salvation, thro' the Redemption of JESUS CHRIST: That they <HI>them&s;elves</HI> were the Servants of the mo&s;t high GOD, and were come to &s;hew them <HI>this Way</HI> of Salvation: That for the&s;e Things <HI>only,</HI> they had been apprehended, beaten and impri&s;oned: That all this hard, and abu&s;ive Treatment of them was fighting again&s;t Heaven. <Q>Therefore Almighty GOD has thus appeared in this Miraculous Manner, &s;hook the Earth, <HI>opened the Pri&s;on Doors, loo&s;ed our Bands</HI> and &s;et us at Liberty.</Q> This, by the Spirit of GOD, wrought &s;uch Conviction on the Mind of the Jaylor, as put him on &s;ome real Concern about his Soul and future State. And now he propo&s;es this Que&s;tion, in the Text. <HI>Sirs, what mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved?</HI> And the Apo&s;tle an&s;wers, <HI>Believe on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and thou &s;halt be Saved, and thy Hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING thus prepared the Way. The&s;e are the two Things that now lie before us for con&s;ideration, namely, the Jaylor's <HI>Que&s;tion;</HI> and the Apo&s;tle's <HI>An&s;wers.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. The Jaylor's <HI>Que&s;tion</HI> in the&s;e Words; <HI>What mu&s;t I do to be Saved?</HI> The Salvation here &s;poken of&punc; don't mean a De|liverance from temporal, but eternal Evil. He don't enquire, how he &s;hould e&s;cape the Magi&s;trates <HI>Re&s;entment</HI> for the Re|lea&s;e of the Pri&s;oners, or Sickne&s;s, or Death or any other worldly Trouble; but how he &s;hould e&s;cape eternal Mi&s;ery; which now he &s;aw him&s;elf in Danger of. The Que&s;tion therefore plainly refers to eternal Life, and is an Enquiry about the Way thither.</P>
<P>THESE Things being con&s;idered; the Meaning is natural and ea&s;y: It is not a <HI>captious</HI> Que&s;tion, with a De&s;ign to entrap and entangle the Apo&s;tle in his Di&s;cour&s;e; but a <HI>plain hone&s;t</HI> Que&s;tion, re&s;pecting a Man's Duty, and Conduct. And the Occa&s;ion, Manner, and Circum&s;tances of its Propo&s;al, &s;eem plainly to denote the Hone&s;ty, and Sincerity of the Enquirer; with a hearty De&s;ire to know the Truth, and the &s;ame Re&s;o|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tion to obey it. I &s;hall therefore &s;ay no more in Expla|nation of it, but make the following <HI>Remarks</HI> upon it.</P>
<P N="1">1. THIS is a Que&s;tion of <HI>universal Concern.</HI> There was Nothing in the Jaylor's Circum&s;tances, that &s;hould make it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eculiar to him, but what is common to all Men. It as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uch concerns me, and you, and every one to enquire, what
<PB N="8" REF="008872_0008_103091B5FAEF3C08">
we mu&s;t do to be &s;aved, as it did him. The great Founda|tion of this Enquiry, is the Relation we all &s;tand in to Eter|nity. If there is &s;uch a Thing as a future State, eternal Re|wards and Puni&s;hments, an Heaven for the Righteous, and an Hell for the Wicked; if we have all precious and im|mortal Souls to &s;ave or loo&s;e; if this Life is a Prelude to the Other; or our eternal Doom depends upon our Conduct here; and we &s;hall &s;pend an Eternity, either the <HI>Realms of Light</HI> above, or in <HI>informal Shades of Darkne&s;s</HI> beneath, ju&s;t as we act a Part on this Stage of Action; (all which, I make no doubt, you will grant at fir&s;t Thought.) Surely when, it is of equal Concern to us all, to know how we may enjoy the Former, and e&s;cape the Latter. It therefore Con|cerns All, both High and Low, Rich and Poor, Old and Young, Bond and Free; yea, it concerns the King upon the Throne as much as the Pea&s;ant upon the Dunghill.</P>
<P>YET, are there not &s;ome of great De&s;cent, and high Birth, but of &s;uch a low, mean, and fordid Spirit, as to fancy Re|ligion don't belong to them? They'll allow that it becomes the Poor, and Wretched in the World, and &s;uch as are in low Life, but think it is too melancholy and dejected a State for Princes, the Nobility and Per&s;ons of Rank and Fortune in the World.</P>
<P>JUST as if the&s;e <HI>dignifyed</HI> Worms of the Earth were got above their Maker, or beyond the Reach of Omnipotence; or could bear <HI>Everla&s;ting Burnings</HI> better than others; or that their Souls, like the <HI>Spirits of the Bea&s;ts,</HI> at Death, would <HI>go down|ward to the Earth.</HI> Indeed, there is too much Truth in what One ob&s;erves, upon another Account, <Q>That which prin|cipally di&s;tingui&s;hes &s;ome Men from the Bea&s;ts of the Field is the different Formation of their Bodies: Their Bodies are <HI>Humane;</HI> but they are in a manner Brutal be&s;ide.</Q> But however &s;uch may amu&s;e them&s;elves, with the&s;e vain Thoughts for the pre&s;ent, they may be convinced of their Mi&s;take, when it is too late.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is a Que&s;tion of the <HI>la&s;t Importance,</HI> not only of uni|ver&s;al Concern, but of the <HI>highe&s;t</HI> Con&s;equence. Religion, to take care of the Soul, to prepare for another World, all which in general, means but one and the &s;ame Thing, is the greate&s;t
<PB N="9" REF="008872_0009_103091B9217DCAA0">
Concern in Life: 'Tis our main Bu&s;ine&s;s, for this End were we born, and came into the World; 'tis more than Meat or Drink, then Food or Raiment. Yea, all the Concerns of this, Life, tho' in many re&s;pects great and valuable, yet when compared with <HI>This,</HI> are but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oys and Trifles.</P>
<P>THIS will ea&s;ily appear, only by con&s;idering, the infinite&punc; Di&s;proportion between this, and the coming World. <HI>What is the Chaff to the Wheat?</HI> Saith the Lord. <HI>What is a Man profited, if he gains the whole World, and loo&s;e his own Soul?</HI> Says our Saviour. What is Earth to Heaven? The Body to the Soul? or Time to Eternity? And in a Word: What a <HI>mean</HI> and <HI>contemptible</HI> Thing, is a &s;hort Pilgrimage in this &s;tormy World, through a thou&s;and Vici&s;&s;itudes, <HI>full</HI> of Aux|iety, and Vexation of Spirit, compared with an eternal Duration in the Realms of Light, and Peace, with Rivers of Plea&s;ure at <HI>God's Right Hand?</HI></P>
<P>RELIGION therefore, and the Care of the Soul, is the <HI>one Thing needful,</HI> and I may add, the only Thing ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary to our well being. We are ready to think, many Things here are nece&s;&s;ary Enjoyments; &s;uch as Life, Health, Riches and Friends; but this is a Mi&s;take&punc; None of the&s;e are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. A Man <HI>may be</HI> happier, and bet|ter without, than with them. I make no Doubt, but <HI>Lazarus</HI> in <HI>Abraham's Bo&s;om,</HI> notwith&s;tanding his Want of all Things in this Life, is a Thou&s;and Times better of it, than the <HI>rich Man</HI> in the Go&s;pel, with all his Plenty and worldly Grandeur here. But if this <HI>one</HI> Thing be wanting, we are totally ruined, and may be &s;ure, our Doom will be Mi&s;ery, and Wretchedne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE great Rea&s;on is, the inevitable Con&s;equences of the&s;e two different Cour&s;es. If we neglect &s;o great Salva|tion; how can we e&s;cape the Damnation of Hell! Awful and dreadful the Perdition of ungodly Men! To go into Eternity, to reap the Wages of an ill-&s;pent Life! <HI>Who can dwell with devouring Fire, or inhabit everla&s;ting Burnings?</HI> But if we <HI>lay hold</HI> on eternal Life, by Faith; our End will be Peace; Glory and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s our Portion forever.</P>
<P>THERFORE, on the one Hand, the Scripture always re|pre&s;ents Religion, and the Care of our Souls, as the only
<PB N="10" REF="008872_0010_103091BC022E45F8">
true Wi&s;dom, and calls it, <HI>the Wi&s;dom, that is from above;</HI> by Way of Di&s;tinction from <HI>that</HI> which is &s;aid to be <HI>eartly, &s;en&s;ual devili&s;h.</HI> And indeed, that Man <HI>only</HI> de&s;erves the Character of a wi&s;e Man, that <HI>fore&s;eeth the&s;e Evils, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ideth him&s;elf.</HI> While, on the other Hand, it as often repre&s;ents the Neglect of our Souls, as the greate&s;t Folly imaginable; and true it is, that no Man in the World lives, and acts &s;o void of Under&s;tanding, and &s;o much be&s;ide him&s;elf, as he that doth this. Neither can there a greater <HI>Dilirium</HI> be&s;al the Minds of Men, than this: If it would be looked upon, Di&s;traction for a Man to run into the Fire; mu&s;t it not be accounted infinitely greater Di&s;traction, to throw him&s;elf headlong into <HI>everla&s;ting Burnings?</HI></P>

<P>FIRST is, that the <HI>Scriptures</HI> are always <HI>urging</HI> and <HI>pre&s;&s;ing</HI> Per&s;ons Duty. I am &s;en&s;ible, that to per&s;uade Men to a Life of Duty, and &s;incere Obedience to GOD, is one of the

harde&s;t Things in the World. For I have not only <HI>Fle&s;h and Blood,</HI> but al&s;o the <HI>Powers of Darkne&s;s</HI> to encounter herein.

And all this being &s;o agreeable to corrupt Nature, Many believe they have nothing to do, but to &s;it &s;till, and wait, till they are <HI>&s;pecially moved,</HI> and wrought upon by the Spirit of GOD.</P>
<P>BUT nowith&s;tanding what <HI>the&s;e</HI> Men &s;ay, if you will go to the ORACLES of GOD, you'll find, that they put us upon Duty from one End of the Bible to the other. And I Be|lieve, there is not one <HI>Sacred</HI> Penman, but what pre&s;&s;es this Matter <HI>be&s;ure Mo&s;es,</HI> and the Prophets, CHRIST and his Apo&s;|tles do it; and they not only urge, and pre&s;s Duty and Obe|dience, but make it one main Point of our Religion; if they don't lay the very Stre&s;s of our Acceptance with GOD and eter|nal Salvation upon it.</P>

<P>SECOND is, that the Scripture <HI>never faults</HI> us for Obedience, or doing Duty in Religion, but <HI>always</HI> for the Neglect of it.

I don't mean, that every Man that has ever done any Duty, will be finally approved of by his Maker. For many &s;uch will be condemned; but then, not for the Duties they have done, but for them they have left undone. The Fault don't lie in doing, but in the Deficiency of Duty.

<P>THE great Rea&s;on is, the Law of GOD is the <HI>Standard</HI> of our Conduct, and of Right and Wrong. What&s;oever therefore, is a Conformity thereto, is right, and commendable; and what is not, is wrong, and Blame worthy. For in&s;tance, the Man that profe&s;&s;es <HI>well</HI> and lives <HI>ill.</HI> The Fault don't lie in the Profe&s;&s;ion, but in the Practice. So he that doth a
<PB N="19" REF="008872_0019_103091D6516C0D70">
good Action, with an ill De&s;ign, the Action is right and com|mendable; but the End is &s;inful.</P>
<P>AND indeed <HI>Duty</HI> to GOD, <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Fal&s;hood, Right</HI> and <HI>Wrong,</HI> as they are founded in the Con&s;titution of Things, &s;o they are inflexible, and unchangeable in their very Natures. The One is excellent, and glorious, the other hateful, and abominable; and they'll remain evermore the &s;ame, let them be found where they will; neither can they be altered in their Nature by the Quality of the Doer, nor the End in doing them. The Sun is the &s;ame under the Earth, as it is above it. A <HI>Jewel of Gold</HI> is of the &s;ame value in a <HI>Swine's Snout,</HI> as it is in a Dam&s;el's Ear. Truth is the &s;ame glorious Thing when &s;poken by a Devil, as by an Angel of Light. Wilful Murder is the &s;ame horrible Crime when committed by a Saint, as by a Sinner: And tho' a Man had never &s;o good a De&s;ign in it, yet it wont make <HI>that</HI> a lawful Action. No more will the vile&s;t End make the Prai&s;ing of GOD, horrible Wickedne&s;s. For it is not the Quality of the Doer, that denominates the Action either good or bad; but the Quality or Nature of the Action denominates the Doer. Apo&s;tacy, and Rebellion would make an Angel a Devil; and Grace and Goodne&s;s would make a Devil, an Angel of Light.</P>
<P>FOR this Rea&s;on, (becau&s;e Virtue and Vice take their Ri&s;e from their Conformity, and Non-conformity to their Standard, the Law of GOD) it is that the Scripture always commends Duty and Obedience, tho' it be found among much Wicked|ne&s;s; the abounding of which, tho' never &s;o much, don't alter the Nature of that which is right.</P>
<P>HOW plain is this in <HI>Jebu's</HI> Ca&s;e! Altho' <HI>he took no heed to walk in the Law of the Lord God of I&s;rael, neither departed from the Sins of Jeroboam which made I&s;rael to Sin;</HI> yet the LORD bears him this Te&s;timony, <Q>Thou ha&s;t done well in executing that which is right in mine Eyes, and ha&s;t done unto the Hou&s;e of Ahab according to all that was in mine Heart.</Q> &sect; And is it not as plain in <HI>Ahab's?</HI> Who, when GOD denounced his Judgments again&s;t him by the Prophet, <HI>rent his Cloaths,</HI> and humbled him&s;elf. Which, <HI>mo&s;t likely</HI> was only in an external Manner; yet this was right &s;o far as it

<P>NOW let me appeal to your Con&s;ciences; Is not this your Condemnation, that you have too much neglected your Duty? Did ever a Man's Con&s;cience condemn him for doing it?

from any One; but it is altogether on the contrary Hand. Of All that I have been acquainted with, under deep Concerns about their Souls, or lying on Death Beds, and ap|prehen&s;ive of their Departure's being at Hand, that were un|der any Conviction of their Con&s;ciences; this has been the Burden of their Song, <Q>We have forgotten God, and too much neglected our Duty; neither have we lived and pre|pared for Death as we ought to have done.</Q> In a Word then, can we ever be plea&s;ing and acceptable to GOD without this Obedience, and Conformity to his Will?

<P>HAVING con&s;idered in the proceeding Di&s;cour&s;e, this great Que&s;tion, and &s;hewn of what infinite Importance and univer&s;al Concern it is; and that altho' the mo&s;t of Men are &s;o indifferent, and unconcerned about it; yet when they come to be &s;ober and &s;eriou&s;ly thoughtful about their future State, &s;olicitou&s;ly enquire, and as earne&s;tly de&s;ire to know <HI>What they mu&s;t do to be Saved.</HI> I now proceed to con|&s;ider,</P>

The Direction and In&s;truction herein con|tained, belongs to every One; and all may take Encouragement therefrom, yea reap the &s;ame Benefit upon the &s;ame Terms. The true Meaning is, that believing in JESUS CHRIST is the

Way to, and the Means by which we, under the Go&s;pel are to obtain, and inherit eternal Life; or in other Words, that eternal Life is promi&s;ed by the Go&s;pel, to them that believe in JESUS CHRIST; and if the Jaylor would comply here|with, he &s;hould inherit the &s;ame: And &s;o may any other Per&s;on too, on <HI>the&s;e</HI> Terms.</P>
<P>THIS &s;eems to be intimated in the la&s;t Clau&s;e of the Ver&s;e, <HI>And thy Hou&s;e,</HI> that is, thy Family al&s;o, &s;hall be &s;aved upon <HI>their Believing.</HI> It may al&s;o mean, that upon the Jaylor's Faith, his Family &s;hould enjoy the Go&s;pel Priviledges, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.

But this is not what I intend to in&s;i&s;t upon; but the Way that leads to eternal Life, which we mu&s;t all walk in, or we &s;hall never ar|rive thither. Here the Jaylor inquiries, <Q>What mu&s;t I do to be Saved? or which is the Way to eternal Life?</Q> The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> An&s;wers, "This is the Way, believe on the LORD JESUS CHRIST." This is the Direction given us by an in&s;pired Per&s;on, and a mo&s;t &s;kilful Pilot: And the En|quiry is; What is the Meaning of it? What is it to believe? or rather, What is the Apo&s;tle's &s;en&s;e of <HI>believing</HI> in this Text.</P>
<P>THIS is a Subject not new, but of equal Date with the Go&s;pel Religion; of great Weight, and Moment, and a corner Stone in this <HI>&s;piritual</HI> Building. Altho' it has been greatly <HI>exhau&s;ted,</HI> much &s;aid, and wrote upon it; yea, Volums and <HI>Folios</HI> filled with it, yet now it needs to be handled by an able Hand, a &s;kilful Pen, and in a <HI>much better</HI> Manner than I am able to do it: And that becau&s;e of the many mi&s;taken No|tions about, and wrong Con&s;tructions that are put upon it. And in as much as Truth never &s;uffers by Examination; and every One ought to lend an Hand, yea exert their utmo&s;t Efforts in defence of, and again&s;t the Errors and Mi&s;take<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s about it; for the&s;e Rea&s;ons, and <HI>e&s;pecially</HI> for your In&s;tructi|on, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> I &s;hall endeavour to give you my be&s;t Thoughts upon it, and according to my &s;mall Abilities, &s;hew you the true Meaning of the Apo&s;tle in the&s;e Words, or ex|plain a <HI>&s;aving Faith</HI> in CHRIST, according to the Go&s;pel. In order hereunto, before I enter upon this; to prevent Mi&s;takes,

and prepare the Way for your under&s;tanding the &s;ame; let <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ob&s;erve one or two Things in general. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. IT is common in the Scripture, that one <HI>chri&s;tian Grace</HI> or Quallification &s;tands for, and is u&s;ed to &s;ignify all the Re&s;t: tho' but One be expre&s;&s;ed, yet every other Grace is included therein. There are &s;everal Things nece&s;&s;ary to make up and complete the Idea and Character of a real good Man; &s;uch as <HI>Holine&s;s, Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Mercy</HI> and the like. Now the Scrip|ture, &s;peaking of &s;uch an One, &s;eldom mentions him, but un|der one or other of the&s;e Characters, and by <HI>that,</HI> means all the re&s;t. Thus the <HI>merciful</HI> Man in Scripture means, not only one that &s;heweth Mercy, but him that has all the Qua|lifications of a real religious Man: So al&s;o the <HI>upright,</HI> the <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and the <HI>faithful</HI> Man, all mean the &s;ame. This is agree|able to our common Way of &s;peaking in this Ca&s;e: When we &s;peak of a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> at one Time, we call him a true <HI>Peni|tent,</HI> at another the <HI>Believer;</HI> by which we mean not only him that has the&s;e particular Graces, but One that has every chri&s;tian Grace and Virtue.</P>
<P>IN like Manner, the Scripture &s;peaks of &s;everal Things, as nece&s;&s;ary Terms of our Acceptance with GOD; &s;uch as <HI>Faith</HI> in CHRIST, <HI>Repentance</HI> of Sin, the <HI>Love</HI> of GOD: And yet at the &s;ame Time promi&s;es the Favour of GOD to each of the&s;e Particulars. In which Ca&s;e, it mu&s;t always be &s;uppo&s;ed that the others are couched therein, and to be under&s;tood thereby; and that becau&s;e <HI>the Way of Salvation is but One,</HI> and the Scriptures are all of a Piece, tho' Different in Expre&s;&s;ion. Here is the Rea&s;on, that the Promi&s;e is made to &s;uch different Things, <HI>viz.</HI> To Believing. <HI>He that believeth on the Son hath everla&s;ting Life.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John iii. 36.</NOTE> To Obedience, <HI>If ye keep my Commandments, ye &s;hall abide in my Love</HI><NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">John xv 10.</NOTE> And even to external Duties, <HI>Who&s;oever &s;hall confe&s;s me before Men, him will I confe&s;s before my Father which is in Heaven.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mat. x 32.</NOTE> And po&s;&s;ibly in &s;uch a Manner, the Words under Con&s;ideration, are be under&s;tood. Therefore,</P>
<P N="2">2. The Apo&s;tle's <HI>An&s;wer</HI> here to the Jaylor, is the &s;ame <HI>in &s;en&s;e and Sub&s;tance</HI> with the other An&s;wers given in Scripture, to the &s;ame Que&s;tion. I have &s;hewn before, that this Que&s;ti|on
<PB N="25" REF="008872_0025_103091EA2B637BA0">
has been a&s;ked various Times, and the&s;e following An&s;wers given thereto, <HI>viz.</HI> That given to <HI>Paul</HI> was <Q>Ari&s;e and go into the City.</Q> To the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ing Man in the Go&s;pel, <Q>Keep the Commandments.</Q> To <HI>Peter's</HI> Converts, <Q>Repent and be bapti&s;ed.</Q> And to the Jaylor, <Q>Believe on the LORD JESUS CHRIST.</Q> Now as tho&s;e Que&s;tions were all really but One; &s;o are not all the&s;e An&s;wers really the &s;ame? tho' different in Words, yet dont they mean one and the &s;ame Thing? Nothing is more frequent in both Scripture, and common Language, than to expre&s;s the &s;ame Thing, by various Words and in different Forms of Expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>YOU may &s;ay with <HI>Nicodemus</HI> in another ca&s;e, <Q>How can the&s;e Things be? The Jaylor was put upon believing, but the others upon working and doing.</Q> It is true, they were; but then, was not the Jaylor as much? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s not Be|lieving, as much, doing and acting as any other Duty what|&s;oever is? I know not why the Word (<HI>Works,</HI> or <HI>working</HI> as u&s;ed in a religious Sen&s;e) is re&s;trained to <HI>bodily Exerci&s;e,</HI> or external Action; or why it is not as applicable to the internal Acti|ons of the Soul <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> I am &s;ure Action or Working is not &s;o much the Property of Body, or Matter, as it is a Mind and Spirit. The Love of GOD, and Repentance of Sin are as much Works and Acts of Obedience, as any external Duty, what&s;oever. And is not Faith or Believing the &s;ame?</P>
<P>YOU may an&s;wer and &s;ay, <Q>No; for Faith is the Gift of GOD.</Q> I grant it; and &s;o is Love, Repentance, Hu|mility, and every chri&s;tian Grace the <HI>Gift of God.</HI> But then the Meaning is not, that believing, loving, and repenting are the Acts of the Divine Being; for they are the Actings of the Soul. It is not GOD that <HI>believes, loves,</HI> and <HI>repents;</HI> but it is the Soul that performs the&s;e Acts. The Truth is, by Strength received from CHRIST, the Soul is enabled to put them forth; and in this very Light, the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> clearly &s;ets this Matter. <HI>I can do all Things thro' Chri&s;t which Strengthen|eth me.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Philip. iv 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE></P>
<P>I AM very confident the Scripture u&s;es the Word <HI>(Works)</HI> in the &s;ame Manner and applies it to the internal Actions of
<PB N="26" REF="008872_0026_103091EC0038D6C8">
the Mind, as well as the external Ones of the Body. Thus, not only Fornication, and Drunkenne&s;s, but Hatred, Envy, and Covetou&s;ne&s;s, are called <HI>the Works of the Fle&s;h,</HI> and <HI>un|fruitful Works of Darkne&s;s.</HI> So we read of the Work of Grace in the Heart; <HI>He which hath begun a good Work in you.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Phil. i 6</NOTE> And Faith al&s;o is called a Work; <HI>This is the Work of God that ye believe on him, whom he hath &s;ent.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John vi. 29.</NOTE> If the&s;e Things are &s;o, then are not the&s;e An&s;wers &s;imilar?</P>
<P>I AM no Ways in&s;en&s;ible, that the Scripture makes a Di&s;|tinction between <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Works;</HI> which is the &s;ame, that Divines generally do between the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">redenda,</HI> and <HI>Facienda</HI> of Religion; that is, the Things to be believed, and the Things to be done. A Di&s;tinction very ju&s;t! for there is a wide Difference between them: The one is the A&s;&s;ent of the Un|der&s;tanding, the other the Con&s;ent of the Will. The former is the Principle of Action, and the latter the Practice upon it. But I don't &s;ee that this any Ways affects the pre|&s;ent Argument, either in Whole or in Part. It don't follow from this, that Believing is not a Work or Act of Obedience, when it is a Compliance with a divine Precept: All that it proves is, that Believing is a di&s;tinct Thing from Repent|ing, Loving, and doing Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>BUT after all, you may &s;ay, as &s;ome have taught; <Q>The Law puts us upon doing, but the Go&s;pel upon Believing.</Q> Here I would a&s;k, How you know this? You'll ea&s;ily an|&s;wer, <Q>The Go&s;pel &s;ays it in plain Words, <HI>Believe on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and thou &s;halt be &s;aved.</HI></Q> But at the &s;ame Time, dont it put us as much upon doing, and us plainly &s;ay? <HI>If you will enter into Life, keep the Commandments.</HI> And our Saviour, <HI>Not every One, that &s;aith unto me, Lord, Lord, &s;hall enter into the King of Heaven, but he that doeth the Will of my Father which is in Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>NOW are not <HI>the&s;e</HI> Texts of the &s;ame divine Authority, and as much to be regarded as the <HI>other? E&s;pecially</HI> if we con&s;i|der that in the Go&s;pel Revelation, we are oftener urged to Duty and Obeying, than we are to Faith and Believing; and if you'll &s;earch from one End thereof to the other, you'll
<PB N="27" REF="008872_0027_103091EDA62FF488">
find, at <HI>lea&s;t,</HI> two Texts in Favour of the former, to one in Favour of the latter. In this great Que&s;tion now under Con&s;ideration, which (as I have &s;hewn before) has been a&s;ked in the Scripture eight Times; the An&s;wers thereto have been given <HI>&s;ix</HI> Times for doing and obeying, and but <HI>twice</HI> for believing.</P>
<P>HOW then mu&s;t we under&s;tand the&s;e Things? Are there two or three different Ways to Heaven? Is divine Revela|tion become <HI>fallible,</HI> that there is no depending on it, or &s;o <HI>my&s;terious,</HI> that none can under&s;tand it? Is the <HI>infallible</HI> Spirit of GOD, got bewildered, and &s;o gives different Directions in the important Affair of our Salvation? at one Time &s;ends us to the Covenant of <HI>Works,</HI> at another to the Covenant of <HI>Grace?</HI> Tells One to believe in CHRIST, Another to take his Yoke upon him; and a Third, to keep the Commands of the moral Law? Or, are CHRIST, and his Apo&s;tles at Variance in their Doctrines, and In&s;tructions, and not only militate again&s;t one another, but again&s;t them&s;elves too?</P>
<P>IN this Ca&s;e, what mu&s;t we do? Are we left altogether at Uncertainties? Is every Man at Liberty to &s;ettle his Opi|nion in Religion, according to his own Humour and Fancy, and pick and choo&s;e &s;uch Scriptures only, as he can &s;hape to his Mind? Or mu&s;t we fix down upon &s;ome <HI>certain</HI> Texts, and con&s;ter them in the mo&s;t <HI>rigid</HI> Manner, as &s;ome are wont to do, and then at all. Adventures buckle and bend the Re&s;t to them; tho' it be never &s;o contrary to all Rules of Gram|mar, and Interpretation. If this will do, then the Rule for under&s;tanding the Scriptures, given by a great Divine, which is a good One, for aught I know, may take Place here: That is, <HI>That tho&s;e Duties that are mo&s;t in&s;isted on, and oftene&s;t repeated in the Scriptures, are of the greate&s;t Weight, and mo&s;t to be regarded, &amp; tho&s;e that are le&s;s in&s;i&s;ted on, and more &s;eldome mentioned, are of le&s;s Importance, and not &s;o much to be regarded.</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Watt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Ortho. and Char. p. 239.</NOTE> By this Rule, for the Rea&s;on before given, Works and Obe|dience mu&s;t have the Preheminence to Faith and Believing, But I &s;ee no Need of any of the&s;e Refuges in the pre&s;ent Difficulties.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="008872_0028_103091EF4F30DEC8">AS <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> &s;aid of <HI>Pharaoh's</HI> Dreams, &s;o I may &s;ay of <HI>the&s;e</HI> Scriptures; they are but one, and the Interpretation is one. They all lead us unto CHRIST, as the only Saviour, and into the Way, he propo&s;es to &s;ave us by; that is, to acknowledge him, &s;uch a <HI>divine Per&s;on</HI> as he is revealed in the Go&s;pel; depend upon him for Salvation, and follow him; that is, comply with his Religion. Thus when Faith is &s;poken of as the Term of Acceptance with GOD; it means not only that we believe CHRIST to be the Saviour, but al&s;o that we receive the Doctrines of the Go&s;pel, and com|ply with its Precepts. So when Obedience is made nece&s;|&s;ary to Salvation; is not the &s;ame Thing implied? that there mu&s;t be the receiving of the Doctrines, as well as com|plying with the Precepts of the Go&s;pel.</P>

When our Saviour at various Times directs us, to <HI>believe in him; take his Yoke upon us; follow him,</HI> and <HI>keep his Commandments.</HI> Is not the Coun&s;el and Advice uniform, and tho' different in Words, yet all aiming at the &s;ame Thing? And are not each one of the&s;e Duties <HI>expre&s;&s;ive,</HI> and implicative of all the re&s;t? Ju&s;t &s;o it is in the Ca&s;es before mentioned. The Apo&s;tle tells the Jaylor, <HI>Believe on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t and thou &s;halt be &s;aved.</HI> Now dont every One take his Meaning to be, that the Joylor mu&s;t believe CHRIST to be the Saviour, become his Di&s;ciple, and follow him, in order to Salvation? And when CHRIST directs the young Man in the Go&s;pel, the Way to Life, the Re&s;ult is the &s;ame; the End of their Conver&s;ation was, <HI>Sell that thou ha&s;t, give to the Poor, come and follow me, and thou &s;halt have Trea|&s;ure in Heaven.</HI> Where is there then any material Difference in <HI>the&s;e</HI> An&s;wers? For my part, I can &s;ee none.</P>
<P>IF you &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed to reply once more <Q>If the Ca&s;e be &s;o, why are the&s;e Things &s;o differently expre&s;&s;ed in the Scripture?</Q> The An&s;wer may be, to let us know, that the go&s;pel Religion, is a Religion of the whole Man; that the Under&s;tanding and Will, both Heart and Life mu&s;t be engaged in it; there mu&s;t be both Faith and Works; and that the&s;e are all of a Piece; GOD has <HI>joined</HI> them together, and no Man may <HI>put</HI> them a&s;&s;under.

them both: There can be no Go&s;pel Faith, without Obedience, nor a Go&s;pel Obedience, without Faith.</P>
<P>AND I may add, as another Rea&s;on hereof; po&s;&s;ibly the&s;e An&s;wers were given in this different Manner, <HI>on purpo&s;e</HI> to adapt them to the particular Circum&s;tances of the&s;e Queri&s;ts, which were very different. <HI>Peter's</HI> Converts were &s;ome, that had a Hand in CHRIST'S Crucifixion; therefore he tells them, "Repent, of this your Wickedne&s;s, and be bapti&s;ed," The young Man in the Go&s;pel was di&s;po&s;ed to do &s;ome Thing for eternal Life, and po&s;&s;ibly tho't, he could merit it thereby: Therefore CHRIST <HI>wi&s;ely</HI> takes him in his own Way, and tells him, <HI>Keep the Conmandments;</HI> but finally leads him into the Go&s;pel Scheme of following him. This Jay|lor it &s;eems, was a <HI>Heathen,</HI> and likely, an utter Stranger to Revelation; therefore the Apo&s;tle tells him <HI>Believe on the</HI> LORD JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>THIS brings me to the particular Con&s;ideration of <HI>the&s;e Words,</HI> as I propo&s;ed, which is to enquire, What is meant here, by <HI>Believing</HI> on the LORD JESUS CHRIST. And doubt|le&s;s this means &s;omething more than the Belief of Devils, or any wicked Men, &s;omething peculiar to GOD'S own Children, that is, the <HI>Faith of</HI> GOD'S <HI>Elect:</HI> To which the Go&s;pel promi&s;es eternal Life. For the Apo&s;tle &s;ays here, <HI>Believe&mdash;and thou &s;halt be Saved.</HI> And is the &s;ame Thing, which Divines are wont to call a <HI>ju&s;tifying</HI> or <HI>&s;aving</HI> Faith. So called, not becau&s;e there is any Thing meritorious in it, or that it ju&s;tifies us in the Sight of GOD by virtue of its own Worth, and Excellence; but becau&s;e it hath plea&s;ed GOD in his great Conde&s;cention to Men, to make it the Term of our Acceptance with him, thro' the Redemption of his Son&punc; And &s;o He will be&s;tow eternal Life on all &s;uch, in whom it is found.</P>
<P>'TIS a little be&s;ide my pre&s;ent Subject to &s;hew, how this divine Principle is wrought in the Soul; yet I would ob&s;erve once for all, That it is done and effected by the divine Agency; or if you like the Phra&s;e better, by the <HI>&s;pecial</HI> O|perations of the Holy Spirit upon the Soul; enlightening the Under&s;tanding, renewing the Will, and aiding, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting our weak and feable Powers, in this Work of Grace.

<P>NOW in di&s;cribing this great Article of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Re|ligion, I &s;hall not go into the Method, (as &s;ome have done) of de&s;cribing it in a <HI>logical</HI> Manner, by its Object, and Sub|ject, its Matter and Form, its Cau&s;es and Effects; nor take the <HI>Opinions</HI> of the Learned; but the <HI>holy Scriptures,</HI> which are the only Rule of Faith and Manners, for my Guide and Directory herein: Being of Opinion, that as it is Revela|tion alone, which has made Faith in the Redeemer, the Term of our Acceptance with GOD; &s;o Revelation is the be&s;t Judge of this Matter; and the liklie&s;t. Way to get a true Under&s;tanding of it, is to &s;earch the Scriptures, and com|pare one Part with another. Accounting al&s;o, that the De&s;cription of <HI>this Faith,</HI> as it is given by CHRIST him&s;elf, and his holy Apo&s;tles, is more accommodated to the <HI>Ge|nius</HI> and &s;implicity of the Go&s;pel Religion; and better adap|ted to <HI>Humane</HI> Capacities, <HI>e&s;pecially</HI> tho&s;e of the vulgar Sort, than all the nice and <HI>critical</HI> Di&s;tinctions in the World, that are made herein by the Learned. According to the Go&s;pel then I take it, that a <HI>&s;aving Faith</HI> contains the&s;e three Things following; all nece&s;&s;ary and e&s;&s;ential to it, I &s;ay <HI>e&s;&s;ential,</HI> becau&s;e if either be wanting, it cea&s;es to be &s;uch a Faith. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. A REAL <HI>Belief</HI> of the Truth of divine Revelation, or that the Scriptures are the Word of GOD: That is, a full A&s;&s;ent of the Mind, to the Truth of all the divine Doctrines, and Propo&s;itions therein contained. And this ari&s;ing not merely from Cu&s;tom or Education, but from &s;olid Rea&s;on, and a full Conviction of the Truth of the&s;e Things, by proper Evidence, and &s;uch as the Nature of the Ca&s;e re|quires. The Sum of which is, that <HI>there is one God, and me Mediator between God and Man, the Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> That
<PB N="31" REF="008872_0031_103091F92470DB80">
He is the only Saviour of the World; and that the Go&s;pel is the only Way of Salvation, be&s;ure to them that live under it. This is the Kind of Faith, the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks of; <HI>without</HI> which, <HI>it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God. For he that cometh to God, mu&s;t believe that he is, and that he is a Rewarder of them that diligently &s;eek him.</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Heb. xi. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE></P>
<P>THIS is one Thing in a <HI>&s;aving</HI> Faith, and the very Founda|tion of it. And it may be, &s;ome have thought this to be the Whole, but if &s;o, 'tis a great Mi&s;take. Tho' it be the Foundation, yet it is not the Building; tho' it be the Corner, yet it is not the Top-Stone. For if this be all, 'tis at be&s;t but a <HI>dead</HI> Faith, if the Apo&s;tle <HI>James</HI> be right; and no more, than what the Devils have; and for aught I know, <HI>Pilate</HI> and <HI>Judas</HI> had it; &s;o may any other Per&s;on too, and yet be in the utmo&s;t De&s;pair.</P>
<P N="2">2. ANOTHER Thing contained in a <HI>&s;aving Faith,</HI> is a <HI>Tru&s;ting</HI> and <HI>Depending</HI> on JESUS CHRIST for Life and Salva|tion; on his Sacrifice for Pardon of Sin, and on his Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s for Ju&s;tification before GOD. This, I take to be the Meaning of the&s;e Scripture Phra&s;es, <HI>Coming to Chri&s;t</HI> for Life, and <HI>looking to him</HI> for Salvation. JESUS CHRIST is re|pre&s;ented in the Scripture, as a Redeemer and Saviour. Now Faith, as it corre&s;ponds, and an&s;wers to the&s;e noble Characters, is <HI>Trust</HI> and <HI>Reliance;</HI> 'tis applying to CHRIST, as the great Phy&s;ician, to heal our &s;piritual Maladies; a flying to him, as the only Refuge, to &s;helter us from the Wrath of GOD.</P>
<P>FROM a Sight of CHRIST'S Abilities and Willingne&s;s to &s;ave, and a Sen&s;e of its own Wants, the Soul is moved to put its Tru&s;t under the Shadow of his Wings, to depend on him for all its Wants in this Life, to be conducted thro' Death; and finally pre&s;ented <HI>faultle&s;s</HI> and <HI>blamele&s;s</HI> before the Throne of GOD. This is another nece&s;&s;ary Part of &s;aving Faith, but yet both the&s;e are not the Whole; altho' &s;ome, if I mi&s;take not, have repre&s;ented it in this Light, as only a believing JESUS CHRIST to be the Saviour, and re&s;ting
<PB N="32" REF="008872_0032_103091FACDFE13B8">
in him for Salvation. Yet if I may be allowed to give my Opinion, I mu&s;t think, that all this comes &s;hort of a &s;aving Faith; that one principle Part is yet behind; yea all this may be without the lea&s;t Participation of a <HI>divine Nature.</HI></P>
<P>FOR where is the Incon&s;i&s;tency of wicked Men's tru&s;ting in GOD for the Salvation of their Souls? I can &s;ee none. <HI>They</HI> are as fearful of Mi&s;ery, and as willing to be happy as any others; and when they &s;ee Danger approaching, and no Help any where el&s;e, they will fly to GOD, and tru&s;t in him therefor. This is the Way of the wor&s;t Men in Times of Danger. Thus the Scripture repre&s;ents the Matter; When GOD <HI>&s;lew them, then they &s;ought him.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm lxxviii. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> So the Pro|phet; <HI>The Heads thereof judge for Reward, and the Prie&s;ts there|of teach for Hire, and the Prophets thereof divine for Money, yet will they lean upon the Lord, and &s;ay, is not the Lord among us? None Evil can come upon us.</HI> Was not this the <HI>Barrier</HI> of the <HI>Jews</HI> in CHRIST'S Time, again&s;t their Rejection? When they &s;aid, <Q>We have <HI>Abraham</HI> to our Father, that is, we are the Children of <HI>Abraham,</HI> the Promi&s;e of GOD is to us, it cannot &s;ail, and this is our Dependance.</Q> And if we come to plain Matter of Fact; is not this the Ca&s;e with Many, of corrupt Principles, and no better Lives? They have a Hope in GOD; and if you'll inquire into the Rea&s;on of it, they'll boldly tell you, <Q>We know we are Sinners, but CHRIST has died to &s;ave &s;uch&punc; there is Merit enough in him; he is a whole Saviour, and our &s;ole Depen|dance is on the Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Merits of JESUS CHRIST.</Q> But you'll &s;ay, <Q>All this is Nothing but <HI>Pre&s;umption,</HI> a fal&s;e Hope, and Tru&s;t.</Q> I know it well enough; but all Hope and Tru&s;t in GOD will be no better, if there is No|thing el&s;e. Wherefore,</P>
<P N="3">3. The la&s;t Thing contained in a <HI>&s;aving</HI> Faith, is the <HI>Love of God,</HI> or a <HI>Principle of univer&s;al Obedience</HI> reigning in the Heart. I &s;ay Love, or a Principle of Obedience; be|cau&s;e I take it, that Love is the very Principle itself, that operates in Obedience. Love, Benevolence, or a Di&s;po&s;ition
<PB N="33" REF="008872_0033_103091FC76CB5BE8">
to do good and right, (all which are the &s;ame in Principle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Principle is a mo&s;t noble, divine Perfection, whereby the Supreme Being is always di&s;po&s;ed to act in the wi&s;e&s;t, and be&s;t Manner; and to, treat all his Creatures; as it is mo&s;t fit and rea&s;onable, they &s;hould be treated by him. And is called by various Names, according to the Diver&s;ity of its Operation, which ari&s;es in a great Mea&s;ure from the different State and Condition of the Object it is exerci&s;ed upon. For In&s;tance, when God reveals him&s;elf, and keeps his Covenant, it is called Truth and Faithfulne&s;s; when he communicates Good, it is called Goodne&s;s, or Benevolence; when he pities the Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, 'tis Mercy and Compa&s;|&s;ion, when he approves of any, 'tis Love, E&s;teem, or Complacency; and when he renders to any, according to their De&s;ert, either of Merit, or Demerit, 'tis Ju&s;tice and Righteou&s;ne&s;s. Thus all the&s;e divine Perfecti|ons, which to our narrow Capacities, appear many and various, are, re|ally but an infinite, and mo&s;t glorious ONE. Even as GOD and CHRIST are One. And this &s;ame divine Principle, when we are made to Partici|pate thereof, influences, and operates ju&s;t in the &s;ame Manner, according to its Mea&s;ure, and our Capacity therefor. The &s;ame Principle, that di&s;|po&s;e us to Kinkne&s;s and Charity toward our Fellow Creatures, will di&s;|po&s;e us to Love and E&s;teem, Subjection and Obedience to the Supreme Being and all others, that are worthy and de&s;eving of the &s;ame.</NOTE>) in every Being what&s;oever, is the great Spring of all right and rational Action, both of Munificence in the Supreme, or any &s;uperior Being, and of Obedience, and Subjection in an inferior, and dependant Being. Thus the great Source of all the Divine Beneficence toward the whole Cre|ation, is Love. This I &s;hall illu&s;trate in one In&s;tance only that is, the Redemption of CHRIST, and this I'll do in the Words of In&s;piration, <HI>God &s;o loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that who&s;oever believeth in him, &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting Life.</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">John ill. 16.</NOTE> This is the Spring of all real Beneficence in the Rich and Wealthy, toward the Poor and Needy; and of true parental Care for Po&s;terity. In like Manner, the Spring is the &s;ame, from whence all dutiful Behaviour in an Inferior does proceed, in Children towards their Parents, in Subjects towards the Magi&s;trate, and in the Creature towards it's Maker. This noble, and <HI>divine</HI> Principle, I take to be implied in a <HI>&s;aving</HI> Faith; and not only &s;o, but the actual Operation of it too, at lea&s;t, &s;o far as to bow the Heart, bond the Will, and bring every Faculty of the Soul into Subjection to CHRIST. Therefore, I expre&s;&s;ed it before, as a Principle reigning in the Heart.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="008872_0034_10309201DB1793D0">IN a Word then, a <HI>&s;aving Faith</HI> is the Submi&s;&s;ion of the whole Man to JESUS CHRIST, as our Saviour, Lord, and Ma&s;ter; a believing and depending on him for Salvation, and yielding up our&s;elves to him, as his Di&s;ciples, and Fol|lowers; or in other Words, a hearty Compliance, or falling in with, the Go&s;pel Way of Salvation. This, I can't but think, is the main Point, the Spirit and <HI>Quinte&s;&s;ence</HI> of a <HI>Sav|ing Faith.</HI> Nothing &s;hort of it is the Thing; but when once a Per&s;on comes to this, he has the Go&s;pel Term of Ac|ceptance with GOD; the Faith that intere&s;ts us in the <HI>Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of CHRIST.</P>
<P>THE whole Affair, as Things appear to me, &s;tands in this Light; Mankind by their Sin, and Rebellion had de|parted from the living GOD; by which, a great Breach was made between them. The Mo&s;t High, by the Go&s;pel, is bringing about their Return, and a Reconciliation between him and them. This is all done in a <HI>Covenant</HI> Way; 'tis a &s;olemn Tran&s;action between GOD and Men, and &s;ome Thing to be done by both Parties. The Language is the &s;ame now, as it was in antient Times; <HI>I will be your God, and ye &s;hall be my People;</HI> tho' the Terms hereof, are &s;ome|thing different now, from what they were then. The Mo&s;t High fir&s;t makes the Motion for our Return; this he does by revealing his Mind and Will, concerning our Salvation; offering his own Son to be a Mediator herein; appointing the Terms of our Reconciliation, and inviting us to com|ply with the &s;ame.</P>
<P>NOW our Return to GOD mu&s;t be, as one expre&s;&s;es it, "An Eccho to this Voice of the LORD." An An&s;wer to the&s;e Calls, and &s;uch a Behaviour, as bears &s;ome Analogy to the&s;e divine Motions; that is, a cordial Entertainment of the&s;e Me&s;&s;ages, accepting the&s;e Offers, and complying with the&s;e Terms. This the Scripture in general calls Faith. Thus we are &s;aid to be <HI>&s;aved thro' Faith;</HI> and <HI>ju&s;tified, not by the Works of the Law; but by the Faith of Chri&s;t.</HI> But then, <HI>this Return,</HI> as it re&s;pects the different Ways, wherein GOD is moving toward us, bears different Denominations, ac|cording to the various Actings of the Soul herein. For In|&s;tance, as Faith is a Receiving the Doctrines of Revelation
<PB N="35" REF="008872_0035_10309204C05CE540">
for Truth; it is called <HI>Belief,</HI> as it is an accepting of CHRIST as our Saviour; it is called <HI>Tru&s;t</HI> and Reliance; and as it is a Compliance with the Go&s;pel Way of Salvation, it is called <HI>Obedience.</HI> In this Sen&s;e, I under&s;tand a <HI>&s;aving</HI> Faith to mean all the&s;e Acts of the Soul, Believing, Tru&s;ting and Obeying. And this is the Return of the whole Man to GOD, every Ways corre&s;pondent to the&s;e divine Motives, wherein GOD applies him&s;elf to every Faculty of the Soul, and has &s;o adapted them, as to draw the &s;ame into Exerci&s;e and Action. Thus the Revelation of divine Truth, is to employ our Under&s;tandings; the Offers of CHRIST, and Sal|vation, to move and allure our Affections; and the Pre|cepts of the Go&s;pel, to put our Will, and active Powers upon Action, and compliance therewith. Now when all the&s;e Faculties are thus cordially &s;et to work toward GOD, in com|pliance with the&s;e De&s;igns of Grace; no Doubt our Recon|ciliation to him is accompli&s;hed. This is the Sinner's <HI>Re|turn</HI> to GOD, according to the Go&s;pel, and whoever thus complies, and &s;o an&s;wers the&s;e Calls, has the <HI>Faith of God's Elect,</HI> and is an Heir to eternal Life.</P>
<P>IN this View of Faith, when the&s;e &s;everal Actings of the Soul therein, are compared together, <HI>tho&s;e</HI> of the Will mu&s;t have the Preheminence; and a Submi&s;&s;ion to CHRIST, is the mo&s;t noble Part of Faith; in as much as the practical Part of Religion, is preferable to the Knowledge, and Profe&s;&s;ion thereof, and that the Illumination of the Under&s;tanding, and the Alluring of the Affections, are but the Means, and for this End, to gain the Will, and bring the Man into an <HI>intire</HI> Subjection to the Obedience of CHRIST.</P>

If you think this is &s;tretching the Matter too far; yet you'll own, it is a re|ceiving CHRIST, as he is revealed in the Go&s;pel. And this will bring it to the &s;ame Thing.

Now can there be a receiving him in all the&s;e Offices, without an intire Subjection to his Government?

<P>AGAIN.

And in this Manner I think, the Apo&s;tle de&s;cribes the Faith of <HI>Abraham</HI> when he &s;ays, <HI>Was not Abraham ju&s;tified by Works when he had offered I&s;aac his Son upon the Altar.</HI> And then tells us: This was the fulfilling of that Scripture. <HI>Abraham believed God<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and it was imputed or counted to him for Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> The Que&s;tion here is, How was this a fulfilling of that Scripture? The general An&s;wer is, This Act of his Obedience proved and evidenced the &s;incerity of his Faith. But is this the Ap&s;tle's Sen&s;e of it? Don't he rather mean, that <HI>Abraham's</HI> offering his Son in Obedience to God's Command, was explanatory of, and di&s;covered the Nature, and Quality of the Faith, which was counted to him for Righteousne&s;s? And &s;hewed wherein it con&s;i&s;ted, that it was a working operative Faith; and really contained in it, a Conformity, and Submi&s;&s;ion to the Will of God. If this is not his Meaning, this In&s;tance of <HI>Abraham</HI> is Nothing to his Purpo&s;e. For the Point, that he is here la|bouring, is to &s;hew, that <HI>Faith without Works is dead,</HI> and that it mu&s;t include Obedience in it, in order to make it &s;aving; and brings this In|&s;tance to prove it; and then concludes, hereb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Abraham's</HI> Faith was <HI>made perfect and the Scripture was fulfilled which &s;aith, Abraham believed God,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;And then if <HI>Abraham's</HI> Faith, which was counted to him for Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, was a Faith without Works, or not including Obedience in i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, for the Apo&s;tle to &s;ay, he was ju&s;tified by offering or when he offered his Son; would be &s;o far from fulfilling that Scripture, that it would contradict, and overthrow it. And in this Sen&s;e, I believe, this Word is generally in the Scriptures to be under&s;tood. Says CHRIST. <HI>I am not come to de&s;troy the Law&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut to fulfil it.</HI> Which means, not to prove there was &s;uch a Law given; but to &s;hew what the Law is; pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> its Precepts into Practice; ex|plain, and give the full Sen&s;e of it agreeable to its Nature and the Extent thereof, which the Jewi&s;h Doctors and &s;o much c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">taile<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and interpreted in &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, contracted and &s;uperficial a Manner.

That this is the true Meaning of the Apo&s;tle, appears from the following Compari&s;on he brings to illu&s;trate this Doctrine by. <HI>For as the Body without the Spirit is dead, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o Faith without Works is dead al&s;o.</HI> Now if there be any Force in the Apo&s;tle's Argument drawn from hence; it mu&s;t be this, that all Believing without Obedience, is no more plea&s;ing to GOD, than a dead, and lifele&s;s Corps can

be to us; and that, as it is the Spirit, that animates, and enlivens the Body; <HI>even</HI> &s;o it is Obedience that enlivens Faith, and renders it acceptable in the Sight of GOD.</P>
<P>THIS great Truth, if there needs any Thing more to be &s;aid upon it, may yet be abundantly confirmed by the&s;e follow|ing Con&s;iderations.</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT the Scriptures <HI>univer&s;ally</HI> make Obedience, and Holine&s;s of Heart and Life, <HI>ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary</HI> to the Favour of GOD, and eternal Life. If you will &s;earch the Scripture, you will find this to be the Language of the <HI>Old Te&s;tament. The Sacrifices of</HI> GOD <HI>are a broken Spirit. Who &s;hall a&s;cend unto the Hill of the</HI> LORD, <HI>and &s;tand in his holy Place? He that hath clean Hands, and a pure Heart. Fear</HI> GOD, <HI>and keep his Com|mandments; for this is the whole Duty of Man.

<P>THE Language al&s;o of the <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> is the &s;ame. <HI>The Pure in Heart &s;hall &s;ee</HI> GOD. <HI>To do good, and communicate are the Sacrifices with which</HI> GOD <HI>is well plea&s;ed. He that doth

Righteou&s;ne&s;s, is righteous even as</HI> GOD <HI>is righteous. Without Holine&s;s no Man &s;hall &s;ee the</HI> LORD. <HI>The Unrighteous &s;hall not inherit the Kingdom of</HI> GOD. <HI>Neither &s;hall any Thing enter there|into, that defileth, or worketh Abomination, or maketh a Lie.</HI> Now when I read the&s;e peremptory Declarations, and con&s;ider, that GOD is the <HI>&s;ame Ye&s;terday, to-day, and forever;</HI> that his Glory, and Man's true Happine&s;s is ever the &s;ame; that the Scriptures are all of a piece, and were indited by the &s;ame infalible Spirit of Truth; I &s;ay, when I con&s;ider the&s;e Things, I mu&s;t conclude, that Religion is the &s;ame in Sub&s;tance, as ever it was; that Holine&s;s, and Righteou&s;ne&s;s are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the Favour of GOD, and no Faith can be <HI>&s;aving</HI> till it has &s;omething of the&s;e divine Qualities in it.</P>
<P>AND I am the more confirmed in this Opinion, when I con|&s;ider the&s;e unchangeable Maxims, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Obligation of <HI>Obedience to</HI> GOD, <HI>re&s;ults from our Relation to him,</HI> and can never cea&s;e &s;o long as that &s;ub&s;i&s;ts. That <HI>Man's true Happine&s;s lies in the Enjoyment of his Maker;</HI> and <HI>a Conformity to him is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in order thereunto. Agreeable</HI> hereunto the grand Plan formed in the divine Mind for his own Glory, and Man's Happine&s;s, was in the Way of our <HI>Obedience,</HI> Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s and Holine&s;s. <HI>The&s;e</HI> Things were eternally de|&s;ign'd to be the Foundation of our Enjoyment of GOD. The original Method propo&s;ed for putting the &s;ame into Execution, was Man's <HI>per&s;onal,</HI> and <HI>perfect</HI> Obedience to the Law: But this failing, thro' Man's Deficiency, opened the Way for the Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation. Becau&s;e we are become weak by rea&s;on of Sin, and could not enter into Life by the Law; GOD in Mercy has interpo&s;ed, and &s;ent his Son to undertake for us in this great Affair.</P>
<P>AND now, is the divine Plan any ways altered? 'Tis true, the Manner of accompli&s;hing it is, but the Plan is the &s;ame. Is not a Conformity to GOD now as nece&s;&s;ary to the Enjoyment of him as ever it was? Did'nt CHRIST come to re&s;tore in us the Image of GOD, that we have lo&s;t? Don't the Go&s;pel aim at the &s;ame Sanctity, and Holine&s;s of Life as the Law did? I'm &s;ure, it tells us, CHRIST came to <HI>Save his People from their Sins. Precious Promi&s;&s;es are given to

Therefore,</P>
<P N="2">2. IF we con&s;ider Faith as the <HI>Image</HI> of GOD upon the Soul, it lies in this divine Conformity. True Faith may be ju&s;tly called a divine Principle, and the <HI>Image</HI> of GOD. So the Scripture repre&s;ents it. <HI>Who&s;oever believeth that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t is born of</HI> GOD.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 John v. 1.</NOTE> And <HI>&s;urely</HI> &s;uch an One has the di|vine Image upon him.

Now wherein does our Faith re&s;emble or imitate the divine Being? not in tru&s;ting, and believing the Truth: For the&s;e are Things incompatible with an Omni&s;cient, and powerful Being; and peculiarly to weak, and dependent Creatures. Neither are they any Participation of a divine Nature.</P>
<P>BUT Love and Benevolence are divine Principles: do|ing right and &s;hewing Mercy, are <HI>God-like</HI> Actions; an Imitation of him in his mo&s;t noble Perfections, yea in tho&s;e Things which he declares, are his Delight. And if there be any Thing, we may glory in, it is in this. <HI>Let not the wi&s;e Man glory in his Wi&s;dom, neither let the mighty man glory in his Might, let not the rich Man glory in his Riches: But let him that glorieth, glory in this, that he under&s;tandeth and know|eth

<P>THE mo&s;t noble Acting of Faith then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es in becoming holy as GOD is holy, merciful as he is merciful; and lead|ing a Chri&s;t-like Life, <HI>harmle&s;s, blamele&s;s</HI> and <HI>inoffen&s;ive</HI> in the World. This will be <HI>adorning</HI> the Doctrines of CHRIST; shining as Lights in the World; and more plea&s;ing to GOD, than whole burnt Offerings, or Thou&s;ands of Rame and Ten Thou&s;and of Rivers of Oyl. Therefore, &s;ays the Apo&s;|tle, <Q>Though I have the Gift of Prophe&s;y, and under&s;tand all My&s;teries, and all Knowledge; and tho' I have all Faith, &s;o that I could remove Mountains, and have no Charity, I am Nothing.</Q><NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xiii. 2.</NOTE> In like Manner,</P>
<P N="3">3. IF we con&s;ider Faith as our <HI>Union</HI> to CHRIST, or what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> wont to be called a <HI>Clo&s;ing</HI> with him; it mu&s;t lie in Ho|line&s;s, and in divine Conformity. For there can be no Uni|on before there is &s;ome Concord and Agreement. <HI>What Fel|low&s;hip hath Righteou&s;ne&s;s, with Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s? What Commu|nion hath Light with Darkne&s;s? And what Concord hath Chri&s;t with Belial?</HI> So al&s;o, if we con&s;ider, as I have ob&s;erved be|fore, that GOD'S Dealings with us, are in a covenant Way; CHRIST offers him&s;elf us on Go&s;pel Terms; that is, that he will become <HI>ours,</HI> if we will become <HI>his.</HI> Now believing and tru&s;ting in CHRIST, &s;trictly con&s;idered, is not a clo&s;ing with this Offer; tho' the&s;e may be nece&s;&s;ary pre-requi&s;ites, and in <HI>Part</HI> thereof; yet do not come up to the Terms of the &s;ame. But it is yielding up our&s;elves in Obedience to CHRIST, and to be <HI>his,</HI> that is, the Fulfilment of the&s;e Con|ditions: And when this is done, the Bargain is clo&s;ed. The Believer is CHRIST'S, and CHRIST is the Believer's, by an everla&s;ting Covenant, that &s;hall never be broken.</P>
<P>THIS will appear very plain, if we con&s;ider the Compa|ri&s;on, the Scripture makes much u&s;e of, to &s;et forth this divine Union by. And that is the <HI>Marriage</HI> Covenant. In Allu&s;ion to which, it is &s;aid to GOD'S People, <HI>Thy Maker

is thine Hu&s;band.</HI> And the Church is called the <HI>Spou&s;e,</HI> and the <HI>Lamb's Wife.</HI> In this Covenant, we all know, the Of|fers of Marriage mu&s;t be made, and complied with; both Parties mu&s;t covenant, and contract; the Man offers the Woman to be <HI>hers,</HI> and &s;he mu&s;t give her Con&s;ent to be <HI>his,</HI> before the Covenant is made, or &s;he can be intituled to his E&s;tate. Again,</P>
<P N="4">4. IF we con&s;ider Faith as our <HI>Conver&s;ion</HI> to GOD, it lies in Holine&s;s and Obedience. Such is the Alienation of our Affections from GOD, and the Oppo&s;ition of our Wills to him, by Rea&s;on of our Sins; that in order to a Reconciliation to him, the Scripture plainly intimates, that there mu&s;t be a great Change wrought in us. <HI>Except ye be converted&mdash;ye &s;hall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI><NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Mat. xviii. 3.</NOTE> This Change the Scripture calls a <HI>New-Birth, a Re&s;urrection</HI> from the Dead, and a <HI>New-Creation.</HI> By all which is mean't nothing more or le&s;s, than a Change of our Affections from the World to GOD, or a being turned from the Ways of Sin to tho&s;e of Godline&s;s. Now true Faith is this <HI>&s;aving Change,</HI> &s;o called; 'tis that by which we pa&s;s from a State of Nature to a State of Grace: And &s;o by the true Believer, and true Convert we mean One, and the &s;ame Per&s;on.</P>
<P>THE Que&s;tion then is; what is it in Faith that is this Change? The An&s;wer, is not believing and tru&s;ting in CHRIST for Salvation; for, as we have &s;hewn before, a Man may do all this, and yet be attached to this Lu&s;ts. But it is his Conformity, and Obedience to GOD. And this will ap|pear by con&s;idering wherein all the Wickedne&s;s, and Re|bellion of the World, again&s;t GOD con&s;i&s;ts; and that in one Word is their Non-conformity, and Di&s;obedience to his Law. For Sin is the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the Law. And <HI>where no Law is, there is no Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</HI> GOD is never offended with any that have not broke his Laws. If &s;o, that Man's Apo&s;tacy and Departure from GOD does lie in their Di&s;o|bedience to him, and Nothing el&s;e; then it follows that &s;o
<PB N="43" REF="008872_0043_1030921C87EEF5C8">
long as they remain in a State of Di&s;obedience, there is not this Change in them; but they are in a State of Rebellion, as much as ever, and no more in a State of Reconciliation with GOD than the fallen Angels are.</P>
<P>AND it as plainly follows that this Change and our Return to GOD can lie in Nothing &s;hort of becoming obedient to him. If Di&s;obedience makes the Breach between GOD and Men; Nothing but Obedience can heal it; if the former puts us into a State of Rebellion; Nothing &s;hort of the lat|ter can bring us into a State of Reconciliation again. You'll &s;ay, it may be, <Q>By this Argument, a perfect Obe|dience is now required of us, in Order to Acceptance with GOD.</Q> I an&s;wer, No; but an upright and &s;incere One is: And that will be accepted. For &s;uch is the Grace of the Go&s;pel, thro' the Redemption of CHRIST, who has performed a perfect Obedience for us; that <HI>if there be a willing Mind, it is accepted according to that a Man hath, and not according to that he hath not.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> x<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></NOTE> Let me add,</P>
<P>ONCE more, it is this View of Faith alone, that makes it <HI>honourable</HI> to God, and <HI>u&s;eful</HI> in this World. What honour to GOD is all the Faith of Devils? No more will be all the Faith of Men, without Obedience to him. To call CHRIST, LORD, and Ma&s;ter, and not to do his Will, is but an Affront to him, and mere Mockery in Religion. A free and chear|ful Obedience to his Commandments, is the greate&s;t Ho|nour, that either Men or Angels can give to their Maker: Yea it is the &s;incere&s;t Token of our Love, and the <HI>highe&s;t</HI> Acknowledgment of his Supremacy and Perfections that we are capable of making.</P>
<P>SO al&s;o, of what Profit is all our Faith to our fellow Men, if it dont make us <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>righteous,</HI> kind and merci|ful, <HI>and exemplary</HI> for Piety and Holine&s;s in the World? Yea, Per&s;ons making a Shew in Religion, pretending to have a Zeal for GOD, and Communion with him, when the&s;e Things are wanting, do but bring a <HI>Scandal</HI> on Religion, and expo&s;e them&s;elves to the <HI>Contempt</HI> and Railery of the World.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="008872_0044_1030921F69E72858">AGAIN, of what Advantage will all Faith be to our|&s;elves, if it don't humble our proud Hearts, mortify our Lu&s;ts and Pa&s;&s;ions, and bring us into an intire Subjection to JESUS CHRIST? No Doubt the&s;e are eternal Truths, <HI>viz. Obedience is better than Sacrifice, Rebellion is as the Sin of Witch|craft; and true Faith, is that Holine&s;s, without which no Man &s;hall &s;ee the</HI> LORD.

<P>THUS have I given you my Thoughts upon this great Article of our Religion. Therefore take your Bible, and look if they are not agreeable to the Scripture, reject them; but if they are, let no Bias, or Prejudice keep you from embracing them.</P>
<P>AND now I beg your Patience a few Minutes longer, while I add two or three Things more, as follows;</P>
<P N="1">1. BY this Di&s;cour&s;e I would not be under&s;tood, <HI>in the lea&s;t</HI> to intimate, that there is any Merit in our Works of Righteou&s;ne&s;s; or that Obedience, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from be|lieving, is the whole of the Go&s;pel Religion; or to ca&s;t the lea&s;t Slight on the Redemption of CHRIST, or the Duties of believing, and tru&s;ting in him, as tho' they were not ne|ce&s;&s;ary to Salvation. For I fully believe, the&s;e Things ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to eternal Life; that it is, <HI>by Grace we are Saved;</HI> that our Acceptance of GOD is for the Sake of, and thro' the Redemption of CHRIST, and that believing, and tru&s;ting in him, is nece&s;&s;ary in Order hereunto.</P>
<P>BUT what I would, is, that all this falls &s;hort of the Mark the Go&s;pel aims at; 'tis not the clo&s;ing with CHRIST the Go&s;pel means; but one Thing needful is yet behind, that is, the Image of GOD as a divine Conformity. This is the grand Point and main Thing; <HI>without which no Man &s;hall &s;ee the</HI> LORD. This is the Thing &s;inful Men want; for this End CHRIST came into the World; the Go&s;pel was given; Be|lieving and Tru&s;ting in CHRIST were in&s;tituted as Means, <HI>even</HI> to re&s;tore this Image of GOD in the Soul. Now if this is not done, the End of the Go&s;pel is no ways an&s;wered; CHRIST has died in vain, <HI>your Faith is vain, and ye are yet in yours Sins.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="008872_0045_10309222A22DCD38">HERE you may a&s;k, "Is not this a <HI>legal</HI> Way of Ju&s;tifi|cation?" I an&s;wer, <HI>legal</HI> or <HI>illegal</HI> it matters not; if it be the Way the Go&s;pel e&s;tabli&s;hes, and CHRIST, and his Apo&s;tles preached up. Yet there is a wide Difference be|tween them; by the Law, a Man was to be ju&s;tified by his own Righteou&s;ne&s;s; by the Go&s;pel, 'tis by, or through the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>Another:</HI> By the former, a perfect Obedi|ence was required; by the latter a &s;incere one is accepted thro' the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of CHRIST. But a <HI>Principle</HI> of Obedience, a <HI>divine Conformity</HI> is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to Ac|ceptance with GOD under all Di&s;pen&s;ations. Can it po&s;&s;ibly be otherwi&s;e? Are there any Contraries in Nature greater than Sin and Holine&s;s? Can a <HI>Swini&s;h</HI> Nature, who&s;e whole Delight is in the Filth of Sin, reli&s;h the <HI>pure</HI> Joys Heaven? Can an holy GOD delight in Sin, or approve of it? And a Devil or a Murderer be received to Glory, before he is re|newed and &s;anctified? If this could be, <HI>&s;urely</HI> there was no Nece&s;&s;ity of CHRIST'S Redemption, or the Gift of the <HI>Holy Spi|rit</HI> to &s;anctify and fit us for Glory.</P>
<P>NO more can any One be purified in the Sight of GOD; the Meaning of which is, approved and accepted as righ|teous by him, without &s;ome Thing of this divine Confor|mity. This is a Con&s;equence &s;o clear, from the foregoing Premi&s;es, that it is not ea&s;ily denied; yet &s;o contrary to the <HI>Antinomian</HI> Notion, that a little to evade the former and &s;upport the latter; a &s;ubtil Di&s;tinction, has been made by Some, between the <HI>Right of Heir&s;hip,</HI> or a Title to eternal Life, and the <HI>Right of Fitne&s;s,</HI> or a Qualification for the Enjoy|ment of it; and &s;o they &s;ay, 'tis <Q>Believing alone that ju&s;tifies and gives the Title to the one, but 'tis Holine&s;s, that is the Fitne&s;s and Qualification for the other. That it is in this Ca&s;e, as with a Child in Infancy; tho' by Birth he is an Heir to an E&s;tate, yet it is unfit for actual Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, 'til he comes to Manhood. Even &s;o One ju&s;|tified by Faith, is an Heir to eternal Life, but mu&s;t be fitted by Holine&s;s, before he can enter thereinto.</Q> An artful Device to &s;upport an un&s;criptural Doctrine! But has this Misfortune in it, that it no Ways &s;erves the Purpo&s;e
<PB N="46" REF="008872_0046_10309226ED53BAB0">
for which it is de&s;igned. For the Rea&s;on why an Heir to an E&s;tate, in his Minority can't inherit the &s;ame, is not, becau&s;e he wants a <HI>legal</HI> Fitne&s;s therefor, but becau&s;e of his <HI>natural</HI> Incapacity to improve it. So, not only the Per|&s;on ju&s;tified, but the greate&s;t Saint while in the Body, is un|fit for the actual Enjoyment of eternal Life; not becau&s;e he wants the moral, or the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> Qualification; but be|cau&s;e <HI>Fle&s;h and Blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God.</HI> Every One therefore, &s;o &s;oon as he is ju&s;tified in the Sight to GOD, has this moral Qualification; and &s;hould his earthly Taber|nacle, that Moment be di&s;&s;olved, he would be fit to en|ter into his Ma&s;ter's Joy. How plain is this, if you will but con&s;ider, that a Man is ju&s;tified either before any di|vine Conformity, or afterwards? If before, then it follows, that a wicked Man, that hates GOD, and whom GOD hates, is yet approved, and accepted as righteous by him. An Incon&s;i&s;|tency too great to be believed! But if 'tis afterwards, then the ju&s;tified Per&s;on has the divine Image upon him, and &s;uch an One is fitted for the Enjoyment of his Maker.</P>
<P N="2">2. THIS View of Faith will help us to &s;ee the <HI>Harmony</HI> and <HI>Agreement</HI> that there is in the &s;acred Scriptures, and reconcile the <HI>&s;eeming</HI> Contradictions between the Preaching of CHRIST, and his Apo&s;tles; I &s;ay, &s;eeming Contradictions; for I look upon it, they are only in Appearance, and not in Reality. And a little Attention to the Ambiguity of Lan|guage in general, and in what a various Sen&s;e the Scrip|ture u&s;es the&s;e Words, <HI>Faith, Law, Works,</HI> and &s;uch-like, will &s;olve the whole Difficulty.</P>
<P>YET a wide Difference is made by Some, if not a real Contradiction between them; and it is generally done in this Manner. Thro' too much Inattention to the&s;e Things, for Fear of &s;lumbering on the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Error of &s;eeking Salvation by the <HI>Works of the Law;</HI> and mi&s;taking the true Meaning of the Apo&s;tle's Arguments to confute the &s;ame; they take <HI>&s;aving</HI> Faith to be a di&s;tinct Thing from Obedience, <HI>complete</HI> and <HI>entire</HI> without it; and that this is not to be brought in|to its Con&s;ideration as <HI>&s;uch.</HI> And now the&s;e Difficulties ari&s;e; <HI>Paul</HI> preaches up Ju&s;tification by Faith, <HI>without Works.</HI> CHRIST makes <HI>Obedience</HI> to the Commandments ab&s;olutely

nece&s;&s;ary thereto. And <HI>James</HI> &s;ays, <HI>a Man is ju&s;tified by Works, and not by Faith only.</HI> And upon the foregoing Suppo&s;itions, they are inextricable Ones too. For they &s;et the Scripture at Variance with it&s;elf, the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> again&s;t his Lord and Ma&s;ter, and again&s;t him&s;elf too. For there is not one &s;acred Writer that expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in <HI>&s;tronger</HI> Terms for Obedience than he does, when he tells to this effect. <Q>That in CHRIST JESUS Nothing avails, but a new Creature, or keeping the Commandments of GOD, and that all Faith without Charity is Nothing.</Q></P>
<P>NOW to extricate them&s;elves from the&s;e Difficulties, they have &s;uch-like Refuges as the&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>Paul</HI> &s;peaks of our <HI>Ju&s;tification</HI> before GOD, but <HI>James</HI> of our <HI>Ju&s;tification</HI> before Men: That the Former &s;peaks of the Ju&s;tification of a Sinner, but the Latter of the Ju&s;tification of the Faith of a Believer. But to evince this, I believe, there needs a new Revelation, for I don't think the Bible gives the lea&s;t Hint of it. But what is wor&s;e than all this, they repre|&s;ent JESUS CHRIST as a legal Preacher only, that he did not preach up the <HI>true Go&s;pel</HI> Way of Salvation, as his A|po&s;tles did afterwards; but preached up the Works of the Law, to prepare Men to receive it from them. A new Doctrine this! The Scripture tells us, CHRIST taught the Way of Life <HI>truly, Grace and Truth</HI> came by him, and that he preached the <HI>Go&s;pel.</HI> But the&s;e Men tell us, that he preached the Law, and not the true Go&s;pel. The Scripture tells us, <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t came to <HI>prepare</HI> the Way for CHRIST. But <HI>the&s;e</HI> in Effect, that He came to <HI>prepare</HI> the Way for his Apo&s;tles.

Only view Faith in this Light, as a Believing and Tru&s;ting in CHRIST, and an in|tire Subjection to his Will; than which, I think, nothing is plainer from the Scripture; and all the&s;e Difficulties vani&s;h at once; there's no Di&s;cord any where, the Go&s;pel and Epi&s;tles <HI>&s;weetly harmonize,</HI> and teach the &s;ame Doctrines;

<P>And yet what a Mystery do &s;ome make of the&s;e Things!

And this will ju&s;tify the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Practice of keeping the Bible from the common People. And what is wor&s;e &s;till, it leaves them under a Kind of Impo&s;&s;ibility of ever get|ting In&s;truction in the Scriptures, or at lea&s;t totally at a lo&s;s where to go for it.

noble Topick far wor&s;e, and more unintelligible than they found it.</P>
<P>NOW what In&s;truction is there in all this? Or what Profit any Ways to Mankind? Methinks, It only tends to puzzle and confu&s;e Per&s;ons' Notions of Faith, and Con|ver&s;ion; leaves them wholly in the Dark, that they know nothing what they are, and totally at a Lo&s;s, where to go for In&s;truction. And the&s;e unhappy Con&s;equences naturally follow herefrom, viz. That People too generally are at a Lo&s;s about their State and Condition <HI>God-ward,</HI> yet ea&s;y and quiet in their Ignorance.&mdash;To Some, the&s;e Things appear &s;o <HI>&s;hocking</HI> and contrary to Rea&s;on, that they are ready to give up all Revelation, to look upon its Religion as a Piece of <HI>Prie&s;tcraft</HI> only, and had rather turn <HI>Dei&s;ts</HI> than embrace it.&mdash;There are Others of a warm Imagination, and a fond Conceit of them&s;elves, that by &s;ome Means or other, fancy that they have pa&s;&s;ed through this Change, and are the Children of GOD; yet the World have no other Evidence of it, but their bare Word; and that not much to be depended upon in any other Affairs.&mdash;And there are Some, that are the mo&s;t humble and con&s;cientious Per|&s;ons, that have the be&s;t Character among their Neigh|bours for holy Living; yet <HI>walk in Darkne&s;s,</HI> and live in Fear all their Days, that they are not <HI>born again.</HI> And all this, becau&s;e they are &s;o puzzled about Faith and Con|ver&s;ion, and know not what it is. By the&s;e Means, it comes to pa&s;s, that GOD'S own Children, are &s;tarved, and <HI>their</HI> Bread, and that which is <HI>holy</HI> is given unto Dogs.</P>
<P>BUT all this, notwith&s;tanding, if Per&s;ons will only go to the Scripture, and take Faith to be, as 'tis there de&s;|cribed, a believing the Doctrines of the Go&s;pel, tru&s;ting in CHRIST, and embracing his Religion, there is No|thing my&s;terious, or hard to be under&s;tood in it; but 'tis &s;o plain, that I may &s;ay in the Words of a great, and good Man. <Q>I acknowledge, I have been &s;ome Times unea&s;y and a&s;hamed, to hear a Divine of the <HI>prote&s;tant</HI> Church, tell his People, that <HI>Faith in Chri&s;t</HI> is a my&s;te|rious Thing; As though there was any Thing in the

<P>And,</P>
<P>LASTLY. There is no ju&s;t Cau&s;e from Rea&s;on or Scripture, for the <HI>loud Complaints</HI> that are among Some, again&s;t <HI>good Works,</HI> or the <HI>preaching up</HI> the &s;ame. But this mo&s;t certainly ari&s;es from &s;ome other Quarter. To talk a|gain&s;t evil Deeds, is <HI>in Deed,</HI> ju&s;t and right; but to &s;peak again&s;t good Works, is &s;inful and vile; and to do this out a Zeal for GOD is <HI>&s;trange</HI> and unaccountable; for this is to talk again&s;t Religion, and again&s;t the Author of it too.</P>
<P>YET are there not many, who call them&s;elves Chri&s;ti|ans, that can't bear to hear the Name of good Works? And is it not, becau&s;e they don't like the Thing? There|fore they are frequently &s;peaking mo&s;t diminutively of them. Yea, have not Some been &s;o &s;evere in the&s;e Cen|&s;ures, as boldly to call them cur&s;ed Things? But what <HI>Wild fire,</HI> and raving Zeal is this! And where will it fly? For what are good Works, but <HI>right</HI> Actions, doing as we ought; obeying GOD'S Law, and conforming to his Will? To call the&s;e Things cur&s;ed, is to call the Law &s;o, that requires them; and to do this, how far &s;hort does it come of calling the Maker of it cur&s;ed al&s;o. To &s;ay the lea&s;t, what daring Wickedne&s;s is this! and &s;hocking, when 'tis under a Cloak of Religion too! But in Imitati|on of CHRIST, I can heartily pray, <HI>Father, forgive them, for</HI> I verily believe, <HI>they know not what they</HI> &s;ay, or <HI>do.</HI></P>
<P>NO more Rea&s;on is their for the great <HI>Out-cry,</HI> that many People make again&s;t the Preaching up Works, and the Duties of Obedience. If I am not <HI>much</HI> mi&s;taken,
<PB N="52" REF="008872_0052_1030923882E637D0">
this is flung at the faithful Mini&s;ters of JESUS CHRIST, by many Per&s;ons, <HI>that they are legal Preachers only; that they neglect the Go&s;pel, and preach up only Works, and Nothing but Works.</HI> This I believe, is altogether a Mi&s;repre&s;entation; for I never heard any <HI>&s;uch</HI> Preaching. But, that they preaching up the Nece&s;&s;ity of a Go&s;pel Obedience, by Faith in the Redeemer, in Order to eternal Life, no Doubt it is true. And what every Mini&s;ter ought, and I believe every faithful One will do. For this is the Example, that CHRIST and his Apo&s;tles have &s;et before us, who have preached up this Doctrine, in as &s;trong Terms as ever I have heard any. Now is it a Crime to follow them? To build upon the Foundation they have laid? Or to try to imitate him, of whom it is &s;aid, <HI>never Man &s;pake like him?</HI> If this is to be vile, I am willing to be <HI>more vile</HI> &s;till.</P>
<P>THEREFORE, for Per&s;ons to cry out again&s;t the&s;e Things, is to talk again&s;t God, and CHRIST, and again&s;t his divine In&s;titutions. And whatever Cloak, and Pre|tence Per&s;ons may have therefor; yet it is actually e&s;|pou&s;ing the Devil's Cau&s;e, and openly oppo&s;ing the Go&s;|pel of CHRIST, and his Amba&s;&s;adors in the main and principal Errand they are &s;ent into the World upon; which is to preach up Holine&s;s, and Obedience to GOD. This indeed is not the whole, but 'tis the <HI>main</HI> Bu&s;ine&s;s to carry on their Ma&s;ter's <HI>De&s;igns</HI> again&s;t the Kingdom of Sin, and to break Men off from their Wickedne&s;s, and bring them into an Obedience to the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>THIS will appear, if we con&s;ider, that this is the expre&s;s In&s;truction in their divine Commi&s;&s;ion. <HI>Go teach all Nati|ons&mdash;teaching them to ob&s;erve all Things what&s;oever I have commanded you.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxviii. 20.</NOTE> That is, to ob&s;erve and do every Thing the Go&s;pel injoins upon us. If we also con&s;ider, what In|fluence our Works will have on our eternal State. <HI>Not the Hearers, but the Doers of the Law &s;hall be ju&s;tified.</HI> GOD <HI>will render to every Man according to his Deeds.</HI> And our
<PB N="53" REF="008872_0053_1030923C8F99D5E0">
<HI>final</HI> Sentence at the Day of Judgment will be pa&s;&s;ed, and we <HI>doomed</HI> to Heaven or Hell, according as our Works have been Good or Evil, in this Life. Again, the Preach|ing up Holine&s;s, and univer&s;al Obedience, as ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary to Salvation; is the grand Engine of the Go&s;pel, and the mo&s;t <HI>powerful</HI> Weapon, for the <HI>pulling down the &s;trong Holds</HI> of Sin. And there is Nothing in all the Go&s;pel Artillery, that will &s;o gall, and vex the Enemy as this will. Wicked Men will bear any Doctrine of divine Revelation better than this; Nothing will wound them like it. Tell the Drunkard in plain Words, if he don't leave off his Cups, he'll certainly be <HI>damn'd.</HI> And there's not an Arrow in the Go&s;pel Quiver, that will &s;tick in his Heart like it. When Paul <HI>rea&s;oned of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Tem|perance, and Judgment to come, Felix trembled.</HI> The Rea&s;on is, if this be the Ca&s;e, they ha'nt a Spark of Hope left; <HI>be&s;ure</HI> while they remain &s;uch. Therefore, when Men are &s;o attached to their Lu&s;ts, that 'tis like Death, to part with them, they can't bear &s;uch Preaching. No Wonder then, they keep a continual Fire, and mu&s;ter up all their Strength again&s;t it.</P>
<P>ONCE more, if we con&s;ider, that this is the mo&s;t <HI>need|ful</HI> Preaching in a <HI>chri&s;tian</HI> Land, in general, and in <HI>ours</HI> in particular. Indeed the whole Coun&s;el of GOD is to be preached up, and no part thereof to be kept back. But then, there are the <HI>greater,</HI> and <HI>le&s;&s;er</HI> Things under the Go&s;pel, as well as under the Law, and the former &s;hould be the prin|cipal Object of the Preacher's Attention. Next to this the <HI>State</HI> of Religion, or <HI>Growth</HI> of Wickedne&s;s is to be kept in view. For as one great End of all Preaching is to put down Sin; &s;o it &s;hould be principally levelled again&s;t tho&s;e Sins, that are mo&s;t prevalent among a People. If it be open <HI>Infidelity;</HI> then that is to be encounter'd. This was the Ca&s;e, when the Apo&s;tles were &s;ent forth into the <HI>Hea|then</HI> World: Therefore they preached up Faith in CHRIST and embracing the Go&s;pel. Where I may ob&s;erve, that when any renounced <HI>Heatheni&s;m,</HI> and declared their Belief of the Go&s;pel, and their embracing it, they were bapti&s;ed. And
<PB N="54" REF="008872_0054_1030923E424905A0">
from that Time they were called <HI>Saints,</HI> and <HI>of the Hou&s;e|hold of Faith.</HI></P>
<P>IF it be <HI>Here&s;y</HI> that is prevailing, then that is to be op|po&s;ed. Such was the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Error in <HI>Paul</HI>'s Time, when they were for bringing <HI>Circumci&s;ion,</HI> and <HI>keeping the Law of Mo&s;es,</HI> into the Go&s;pel Religion. Therefore the Apo&s;tle, to confute this Error, teaches, <HI>That a Man is not ju&s;tified by the Works of the Law, but by the Faith of Chri&s;t.</HI> And if it be Di&s;obedience to GOD, <HI>Immorality</HI> or <HI>Profanene&s;s,</HI> that is prevailing; then the&s;e Crimes are to be openly te&s;ti|fied again&s;t, and principally born down upon. Thus the Artillerly of the Go&s;pel &s;hould always be turned and aim'd at the &s;tronge&s;t Force, and principal Batteries of the Enemy.</P>
<P>THIS was the univer&s;al Practice of CHRIST and all the <HI>in&s;pired</HI> Teachers, to adapt their Di&s;cour&s;es to the <HI>Times,</HI> Occa&s;ions and particular Circum&s;tances of their Hearers. And why &s;hould it not be &s;o now? What then mu&s;t be the main Drift of our Preaching at the pre&s;ent Time? This will be determined by the Sins, that are prevalent in the Land. Well then, What are the&s;e? Not open <HI>In|fidelity.</HI> The Land is become <HI>Chri&s;tian;</HI> and People gene|rally receive the go&s;pel Revelation; neither is it call'd in Que&s;tion. For my Part, I don't know of a <HI>Dei&s;t</HI> in the Land. Is there &s;o <HI>much</HI> Need then of pre&s;&s;ing that which every One believes?</P>
<P>AGAIN. Are there any <HI>Here&s;ies</HI> prevailing in the Land; by which, I mean, a Denial, or not owning any of the fundamental Doctrines of the Go&s;pel? I know of none.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Except by Here&s;y, we mean every Thing has is wrong and Sinful: &s;uch as Ignorance of the Scriptures; all Mi&s;takes about the Meaning of particular Texts; every different Sentiment, even in the le&s;&s;er Matters of Religion; and all Immorality, and Ungodline&s;s.

Put your Tru&s;t in JESUS CHRIST as your only Saviour. <HI>Lean not to your own Under&s;tandings;</HI> but ince&s;&s;antly im|plore the Aids of GOD'S Holy Spirit, to guide you into the Truth; and a&s;&s;i&s;t you in all your Duty.

If the&s;e Things be in you, and abound,&mdash;ye &s;hall never fall.</HI> And for Motive hereunto, I'll only leave with you, the&s;e awful Scriptures, which, I be&s;eech you, keep continually before your Eyes. <HI>The Wicked &s;hall be turned into Hell. The unrighteous &s;hall not inherent the Kingdom of GOD. And without Holine&s;s no Man &s;hall &s;ee LORD.</HI></P>
