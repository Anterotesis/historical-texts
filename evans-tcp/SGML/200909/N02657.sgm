<P>YEA I think it meet as long as I am in this Tabernacle, to &s;tir you up by putting you in Re|membrance; Knowing that &s;hortly I mu&s;t put off this my Tabernacle, even as our <HI>LORD JESUS CHRIST</HI> hath &s;howed me.</P></Q>

<P>THE Death of the aged, holy, vene|rable, <HI>Apo&s;tolical Man of GOD,</HI> SOLOMON STODDARD, for a long cour&s;e of Years (thro' Grace) the faith|ful <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> of the Church of CHRIST in <HI>Northampton,</HI> has led me to the <HI>Words</HI> read for the pre&s;ent <HI>Lecture.</HI></P>
<P>I think it but a decent and dutiful Re&s;pect to his <HI>Name</HI> and Memory, (giving unto <HI>Free Grace</HI> the Glory of all that He was made to us and did among us) in this <HI>Place</HI> and <HI>Lecture,</HI> upon the fir&s;t notice of his expected <HI>Decea&s;e,</HI> to mourn the common Bereave|ment of all our Churches. For as he has been for
<PB N="2" REF="003149_0005_0FF0800692B7FA18">&s;ome Years the mo&s;t <HI>aged</HI> Mini&s;ter in the <HI>Province,</HI> &s;o in the Cour&s;e of a laborious, burning Mini&s;try, he has for many Years &s;hone before us in the Gifts and Graces of the HOLY SPIRIT; a <HI>Prophet</HI> and a <HI>Father</HI> not only to the nei'bouring Churches and Pa&s;tors his own <HI>County,</HI> but al&s;o to tho&s;e of the whole <HI>Land.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER tho&s;e in his own Nei'bourhood, it may be his Name and Mini&s;try were not more dear and honoured any where than in this great <HI>Town,</HI> the Place of his <HI>Birth;</HI> where both Mini&s;ters and People receiv'd his <HI>annual Vi&s;its</HI> with a pecullar Reverence and Plea&s;ure; as He made them to us (while his bodily Strength con|tinued for &s;o long a Journey, and this was to near his <HI>Eightieth</HI> Year) with all the Delight and Satisfaction that a FATHER has in vi&s;iting the Children of his Love; bringing us the &s;olemn Coun&s;els and Warnings of GOD from Year to Year, which were received by Us in crowded A&s;&s;emblies, that hung on his Lips, as a People that &s;ought Righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;hewed much Love.</P>
<P>THEN it was that this Lecture was <HI>His,</HI> and he was as a PETER here among the Di&s;ciples and Mini&s;ters of our LORD JESUS; very much our <HI>Primate,</HI> and a <HI>Prince</HI> among us, in an Evangelical and the truly <HI>Apo&s;tolical</HI> &s;en&s;e; that is to &s;ay, among the <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> for Light and Integrity, for Knowledge and great Judg|ment, for Faith and Love which is in CHRIST JESUS, and for Zeal and Boldne&s;s in the Cau&s;e of Truth and Holine&s;s: But I mu&s;t add, None le&s;s affecting a <HI>Pre|heminence</HI> above his Brethren; none more pleas'd with Retirement, and none more with public Appearances for occa&s;ional Services to CHRIST and Souls; none more &s;tudious and inqui&s;itive after Truth; none more dili|gent and laborlous in his Studies; none more lively, fervent and unwearied in the Pulpit; nor did any one love his Work and his <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> better.</P>
<P>No one in our Churches has run (thro' Grace) a longer, a brighter and a like con&s;tant Cour&s;e of <HI>Preach|ing,</HI> on LORD's-Days and Lectures, to the fini&s;hing
<PB N="3" REF="003149_0006_0FF0800BA6EEFEC8">the <HI>eighty fifth</HI> Year of his Life; his LORD giving him a &s;trength of Body equal to that of his Soul, for &s;uch a <HI>Run</HI> of Labour and Service; and therein a happy fruitful old Age; his Day and his Work ending together.</P>
<P>AND accordingly, No Mini&s;ter in the Land liv'd more mindful of <HI>Death,</HI> his own and his People's Death; the fir&s;t and la&s;t Character of a Mini&s;ter of the <HI>New-Te&s;tament,</HI> &s;tudions to &s;ave Him&s;elf and Them that hear him, and watching for Souls as One that mu&s;t give an Account. And who among Men, for many a Year pa&s;t, has enjoy'd a more &s;etled <HI>Peace,</HI> and full A&s;&s;urance of his Intere&s;t in CHRIST, than this Servant of the LORD did? whereby he liv'd above the Fear of Death, in a diligent Preparation for it, and in a plea&s;ing Ex|pectation of it.</P>
<P>WHEREFORE no Mini&s;ter in the Land, (I am bold to &s;ay it) for &s;cores of Years pa&s;t, could with greater Freedom and Plea&s;ure, Integrity and Truth, have taken to Him&s;elf <HI>tho&s;e Words</HI> of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter,</HI> which I have cho&s;en for his <HI>Funeral;</HI> and have &s;aid to his Hearers in the Name and Fear of GOD, with all Hu|mility and Confidence; &mdash; "<HI>To You <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> have ob|tained like precious Faith with us, through the Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of GOD, and our Saviour</HI> JESUS CHRIST; &mdash; <HI>I will not be negligent to put you always in Re|membrance, tho' ye know and be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Truth: Yea I think it meet as long as I am in this Taber|nacle, to &s;tir you up by putting you in Remembrance; knowing that &s;hortly I mu&s;t put off this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">, as our</HI> LORD JESUS CHRIST <HI>hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">, I will endeavour that after my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> you may be able to have the&s;e things always in Remembrance.</HI></P>
<P><HI>WORDS</HI> very &s;utable from a <HI>dying</HI> Mini&s;ter to <HI>dying</HI> Hearers.

<P>Now the <HI>Truths</HI> that are here pre&s;ented to us for our pre&s;ent Meditation; and &s;erious Con&s;ideration, are the&s;e,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. THAT the <HI>Body</HI> of Man is the Souls <HI>Taber|nacle.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. THAT <HI>we mu&s;t &s;hortly put off</HI> this our Tabernacle.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. THAT our LORD JESUS CHRIST <HI>hath &s;hewn us</HI> that we mu&s;t do &s;o.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. THAT the <HI>Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t</HI> mu&s;t die as well as others.</ITEM>

</LIST></P>
<P N="1">I. THE <HI>Body</HI> of Man is the <HI>Tabernacle</HI> of the Soul. <HI>This my Tabernacle.</HI> As our LORD JESUS once pointed to his own &s;acred Body, and &s;aid, <HI>This Temple.</HI> HE was the <HI>true Tabernacle,</HI> which the LORD pitched, and not Man. His human Nature was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> for therein the SON OF GOD <HI>tabernacled</HI> with us. &mdash; <HI>Our</HI> Bodies are the <HI>&s;mall, frail</HI> and <HI>movable</HI> Dwellings of our Souls, of <HI>mean</HI> Materials, <HI>ea&s;ily</HI> taken down, and to be <HI>taken down</HI> within a <HI>little</HI> time, and to be <HI>&s;et up again</HI> to dwell in. We continue in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> but a few days, and we leave but for a few <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, to return into them again.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> we con&s;ider the Body of <HI>Man</HI> in its <HI>original</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> and <HI>fir&s;t</HI> State; or if we con&s;ider <HI>our</HI> Bodies in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> and</HI> Re&s;urrection State; they are <HI>more</HI> than Tabernacles. They were and are in <HI>this</HI> View of them
<PB N="5" REF="003149_0008_0FF08011AEA29940">the Building of GOD, a Hou&s;e not made with Hands; made for Perpetuity; for Immortality, never to be taken down; but to be changed, made Spiritual and Incorruptible, and to be taken <HI>up</HI> to GOD, to be a part of his own Man&s;ion and Palace in the heavenly Places.</P>
<P>YET as the Body <HI>now</HI> is, it is wonderfully made, &s;et up and kept up. Call it a <HI>Tabernacle;</HI> it is a &s;ine and noble one in it &s;elf; like that of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> a work of great De&s;ign, and whereon much Art and Co&s;t and Care was be&s;towed. Our Souls could neither provide this <HI>Tent</HI> for them&s;elves; nor can they now uphold, or pre&s;erve it from falling, no not a Day. The Soul neither may nor can leave it at it's plea&s;ure, tho' it moves and removes it at it's Will; and often injures it by it's pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>THE Body &s;hould be a Tabernacle for GOD to dwell in; for Him to be wor&s;hip'd and &s;erv'd in, both here and for ever.</P>
<P>IF there is any thing now <HI>mean</HI> in it, we our &s;elves have brought <HI>that</HI> upon it: We have made it <HI>this Cor|ruptible</HI> falling thing, which it is now become. It was a fair and beauteous Hou&s;e, as GOD fram'd and fini&s;h'd it; and will be &s;o again, when he &s;hall rai&s;e it again and re&s;tore it.</P>
<P>LET us <HI>thank</HI> GOD for this Dwelling He made it for us, gave it to us, put us into it. Let us give Him the <HI>Glory</HI> of it:<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Heb. x. 5. P&s;al. xxii. 9. cxxxix. 14.</NOTE> <HI>"A Body ha&s;t Thou prepared me. Thou art He that did&s;t take me out of the Womb! I will prai&s;e Thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made!"</HI></P>
<P>LET us con&s;ecrate the <HI>Tent,</HI> &s;uch as it is, to GOD: He will accept the Dedication of it and dwell in it. He
<PB N="6" REF="003149_0009_0FF0801340D4FB70">made it for Him&s;elf at fir&s;t, and he now requires us to give it back to Him, to u&s;e it for Him and &s;erve Him in it. Let us &s;upplicate Him to &s;anctify us to Him&s;elf, that we may be Holy both in Body and Spirit; and that He may be glorified in both, for they are His, by every Right, of Creation, Redemption and daily Pre|&s;ervation.</P>
<P>BUT while we are in the&s;e mortal Bodies, let us e&s;teem them as <HI>no</HI> more than our earthly Hou&s;e and Tabernacle; our meaner and dying Part. Let us daily think of leaving this Hou&s;e of Clay, expect to remove <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> out of it. If we wait a few days, <HI>the Grave is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> Hou&s;e;</HI> and <HI>the Graves are ready for us</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Job xvii. 1, 13.

By Faith let us <HI>&s;ojourn</HI> here as in a &s;trange Land, dwelling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> Tents, as the <HI>Heirs</HI> of Promi&s;e did of old. And con|tent in our pre&s;ent Lot, let us be &s;eeking a <HI>better Country;</HI> heavenly and everla&s;ting Habitations.</P>
<P>Finally, WHO hurts or <HI>mi&s;u&s;es</HI> his own Dwelling? Who is there but takes care of it and <HI>repairs</HI> it? and yet who &s;ets up a <HI>Booth</HI> and thinks of living <HI>long</HI> in it?</P>
<P N="2">II. WE <HI>mu&s;t &s;hortly put off</HI> this our Tabernacle, and we &s;hou'd <HI>know</HI> that we mu&s;t do &s;o. The <HI>phra&s;e</HI> here &s;eems not quite &s;o proper: We &s;peak of <HI>putting off</HI> our Cloaths, but of <HI>taking down</HI> a Tabernacle, or of <HI>going out</HI> of it. But &s;o it plea&s;es the HOLY GHOST to blend the <HI>Metaphors,</HI> in my Text and in other places<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. v. 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DEATH is the Souls <HI>putting off</HI> the Body, as a Man puts off his <HI>Clothes</HI> at Night, after the Work of the Day, and lies down to Sleep. So <HI>Aaron</HI>'s putting off his Prie&s;tly <HI>Rebes,</HI> was the Figure &amp; Image of his fol|lowing <HI>Decea&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Again, DEATH is the Souls <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> out of it's Dwelling of Fle&s;h. The Body is no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> habitable; it falls and moulders into du&s;t. As King <HI>Hezekiah</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="003149_0010_0FF08016E85C94A0">prayed at the Approach of Death,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. xxxviii. 12.</NOTE> "<HI>My Age is re|moved as a Shepherds Tent.</HI></P>
<P>SURELY <HI>Jonadah</HI> the Father of the <HI>Rechabites,</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Jer. xxxv. 2.</NOTE> who commanded his Po&s;terity not to build them Hou&s;es, but all their Days to dwell in <HI>Tents;</HI> meant thereby to admoni&s;h them that their pre&s;ent Life in the <HI>Body</HI> was no other than as in a Tent and <HI>Tabernacle;</HI> and that in the wi&s;e Con&s;ideration hereof they &s;hould piou&s;ly <HI>pa&s;s the Time of their &s;ojourning here in Fear.</HI> And thus the <HI>Rechabites</HI> are an Image unto the Church for ever, of Men &s;piritually wi&s;e for their Souls and a better Life.</P>
<P>IN our <HI>Text</HI> there are <HI>three</HI> things &s;aid about our <HI>putting off</HI> our Tabernacle, "that we <HI>mu&s;t</HI> do it, that we mu&s;t do it <HI>&s;hortly,</HI> and that we <HI>know</HI> we mu&s;t do &s;o.</P>
<P N="1">1. WE <HI>mu&s;t</HI> do it: It is not left to our Choice, <HI>if</HI> we will, or <HI>when,</HI> or <HI>how</HI> it &s;hall be. Death comes with his Commi&s;&s;ion and Authority from GOD, and &s;ays to us, You <HI>mu&s;t</HI> and &s;hall go. His Call to us is, <HI>Come away!</HI> and with a &s;trong Hand he hales and turns us out. He pulls down the Tabernacle over our heads, and tears the Body in pieces, P&s;al. 90.3. <HI>Thou turne&s;t Man to De&s;truction.</HI> 104.29. <HI>Thou take&s;t away their Breath, they die and return to their Du&s;t.</HI> The <HI>Lof|tine&s;s</HI> of Man is bowed down, and the <HI>Haughtine&s;s</HI> of Man is laid low, in the Day of <HI>Death.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. WE mu&s;t die <HI>&s;hortly.</HI> How &s;oon or &s;uddenly we know not; but we are &s;ure it will be &s;hortly, "<HI>Are not my Days few?</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Job. x. 20. x<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">v. 1.

For what is your Life? it is even as a Vapour, that endureth but a little while, and
<PB N="8" REF="003149_0011_0FF08019DAFB6110">then vani&s;hes away.</HI> So the<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Job vii. 9. P&s;al. xc. 6, Job ix 26. vii. 6.</NOTE> <HI>Cloud</HI> is con&s;umed by the Sun, or the Wind drives it away. So the <HI>Gra&s;s</HI> flou|ri&s;heth in the Morning and is cut down at Even. So the <HI>Po&s;t</HI> by Land, and the &s;wift <HI>Ships</HI> at Sea, and the <HI>Eagle</HI> in the Air, pa&s;s away. And &s;o the Weavers <HI>Shuttls</HI> pa&s;&s;es in an In&s;tant thro' the Loom. Next to this is <HI>Nothing</HI> at all; and &s;uch is our Age before GOD; P&s;al. 39.5. <HI>My Age is as nothing before Thee.</HI> Thus the Scripture teaches us to think and &s;peak of the <HI>&s;hortne&s;s</HI> of Human Life.</P>
<P N="3">3. WE <HI>know</HI> that it is thus &s;hort. <HI>Knowing that I mu&s;t &s;hortly put off this my Tabernacle.</HI> Who of us but <HI>know</HI> this, in one &s;en&s;e? and yet how <HI>few</HI> of us may there be that know it, in another? and as we all ought to know it? Would to GOD we every one could &s;ay like <HI>Peter,</HI> that we <HI>truly</HI> know it! that we &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider and realize it every Day we live!</P>
<P>FEW, very few among the dying Children of Men have a <HI>real</HI> Knowledge of <HI>this</HI> plain and common Truth. <HI>The Living know that they &s;hall Die;</HI> but what then? how few among the Living <HI>con&s;ider</HI> it, lay it to heart, keep it in mind, and <HI>Live</HI> as if they knew this? This is to <HI>know</HI> and under&s;tand in the Language of <HI>Scripture</HI> and of my <HI>Text.</HI></P>

<P>IN the <HI>Sacraments</HI> of Chri&s;tianity, we remember in &s;olemn Form <HI>the Dying of the</HI> LORD JESUS, and are awfully minded of our <HI>own</HI> approching change.

<P>So in all the <HI>Records</HI> of the Death of Saints and Sinners, from the Death of <HI>Adam, Noah, Abra|ham</HI> and <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> to the Death of <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Iohn,</HI> the LORD has &s;hewn his People, from Generation to Generation, that they mu&s;t &s;hortly die. <HI>Your Fathers where are they? and the Prophets, do they live for ever?</HI> And who art Thou, O Man! who&s;e <HI>inward Tho't is, that thy Hou&s;e &s;hall continue for ever? and thy Dwelling-place to all Generations?</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, IN the Deaths and <HI>Funerals</HI> of our Re|lations and Friends, from Week to Week, CHRIST &s;hews us that we al&s;o mu&s;t &s;hortly die.

<P>FOR the&s;e <HI>Rea&s;ons</HI> Mini&s;ters die, and &s;hould die, like other Men. They <HI>know</HI> it, and have nothing to &s;ay again&s;t it. And they <HI>need</HI> and <HI>ought</HI> to know it practi|cally, lay it to their Heart and live accordingly; as much, if not more than Others. PETER had the <HI>Primacy</HI> in this re&s;pect, among the <HI>Brethren</HI> to whom he wrote; tho' not among the <HI>Apo&s;tles.</HI> In this let <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> learn of Him, and be Followers of him, as he was of CHRIST.</P>
<P>WOULD to GOD it could be truly &s;aid of all the <HI>Mini&s;ters of</HI> JESUS, that <HI>they</HI> have a &s;aving Know|ledge of <HI>this</HI> plain Truth, which they preach to Them|&s;elves and Others from day to day! How happy were it for <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> and <HI>Flocks</HI> together! if this <HI>fir&s;t</HI> and &s;mall Principle in the <HI>Oracles</HI> of GOD, known to every <HI>Babe</HI> in the Church, were but indeed fully learn'd by the <HI>Doctors</HI> in it? <HI>Art thou a Ma&s;ter in I&s;rael, and

<P>BUT who are &s;o <HI>obliged,</HI> bound and advantaged to con&s;ider duely of, and live by the Knowledge of their own Mortality, as the <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of the Go&s;pel? Who are more call'd to <HI>conver&s;e</HI> with Death, and to look into Eternity than they are? How often are <HI>they</HI> at the &s;ick and dying Beds of People, to the mo&s;t &s;olemn Ends and Purpo&s;es; to mini&s;ter to their Souls, to enquire into their Spiritual State to a&s;&s;i&s;t them and pray over them in the Agonies of Death? and to follow their Remains, among the Mourners, to the Grave!</P>
<P>WHO &s;hould know and under&s;tand their own Mor|tality, if not <HI>they</HI> who are &s;o often call'd to <HI>preach</HI> upon the dark and melancholly Subject? and to lead others into the &s;erious Contemplation of it, in all its Weight.

<P>AND it is to be charitably <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> of the Mini&s;ters of Religion, that as <HI>many</HI> of them, and far <HI>more</HI> in Pro|portion of this <HI>Order</HI> than of any other, have the <HI>&s;a|ving</HI> Knowledge of the Truth before us; or el&s;e <HI>Woe</HI> unto their Souls, and to the Churches of CHRIST for their &s;akes. This doth in a &s;pecial manner agree to their holy and &s;piritual Calling, to their peculiar Bonds and Ordination Vows, and to their high Profe&s;&s;ion. And this is the Way for them to be ble&s;&s;ed by GOD and made &s;ucce&s;sful in their Work: As <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> prayed for, and prophe&s;ied concerning the Tribe of <HI>Levi,</HI> and ble&s;&s;ed them with his dying Lips; Deut. 33.8. <HI>Let thy Urim and thy Thummim be with thy Holy One.</HI> Which was to &s;ay, "Let GOD furni&s;h them with tho&s;e Gifts and Graces, that Light and Integrity, that Illumination and Sanctification, which are requi&s;ite to the faithful Di&s;|charge of the Duties of their high and &s;acred Office. And &s;o <HI>Aaron</HI> was illuminated, living in a Preparation to <HI>undre&s;s</HI> and die, at a Day or an <HI>Hours</HI> warning. And this is a &s;hining part in the Character of ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Paul;</HI> as he tells the <HI>Corinthians</HI> that by Death working in <HI>him,</HI> Life &s;piritual and eternal was the more convey'd to <HI>them</HI> thro' his Mini&s;try; he being the more quickned from day to day in &s;erving their Souls, by the daily Views he had of his own Dying: Which I take to be the &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e Words, 2 Cor. 4.12. <HI>"So then Death <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> in us, but Life in you".</HI> For, the more a lively Apprehen&s;ion of <HI>Death</HI> and Eternity works in the <HI>Mini&s;ters of</HI> CHRIST, &s;o much the more like are they to be in&s;trumental to the &s;piritual <HI>Life</HI> of their People.

<P>O the Comfort and Plea&s;ure to a Mini&s;ter in <HI>Age,</HI> or to any Chri&s;tian, that can thus look back on a Life &s;pent in <HI>the Knowledge of Death,</HI> and a diligent Preparation for it.

<P>BRETHREN, <HI>Pray for us,</HI> your unworthy Mini&s;ters, that for the honour of CHRIST, and the &s;ake of our own and your Souls together, We may be help'd of GOD (and you with us) to live looking into our Graves, and mindful of the things that are un&s;een and eternal. This is the Way to be labouring Mini&s;ters, and fruitful Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>LOOK on us, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> as poor frail <HI>dying Preachers,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing with you into an awful Eternity: And GOD help <HI>Us</HI> to look on You with the &s;ame Eye.

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Northampton,</HI><DATE><HI>Feb.</HI> 13. 1728, 9:</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>ON the 11th In&s;tant died, and this Day was buried here, the very reverend and aged, our honoured and beloved Pa&s;tor, Mr. <HI>Solomon Stoddard;</HI> too eminent a Per&s;on to be &s;uffer'd to &s;lip into his Grave in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>HE was born at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> Anno 1643. The elde&s;t Son of <HI>Anthony Stoddard</HI><ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR>; by his &s;econd Wife, who was the Si&s;ter of Sir <HI>George Downing.</HI> Had his School Learning at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> under the fa|mous <HI>Ma&s;ter Corlet.</HI> Took his fir&s;t Degree at <HI>Har|vard College</HI> Anno 1662. And was afterwards one of the Fellows of that Hou&s;e. Growing out of Health by rea&s;on of too clo&s;e an Application to his Studies, he was prevail'd on to take a Voyage to <HI>Barbados,</HI> with Governor <HI>Serle</HI> as his Chaplain, where he preach'd to the Di&s;&s;enters in that I&s;land. But his State of Health growing better, he return'd to his Native Country in about two years.</P>
<P>UPON the Death of the excellent Mr. <HI>Eleazer Mather,</HI> the fir&s;t Pa&s;tor of the Church in this Place, who died when but 35 Years of Age, Mr. <HI>Stoddard</HI> was cho&s;en and invited to &s;ucceed him. He was ordain'd to the Pa&s;toral Office over us, Anno 1672; and we have injoy'd an uncommon Ble&s;|&s;ing in him, for 56 Years together.</P>
<P><PB REF="003149_0030_0FF080532BD28D38">
HIS natural Powers were quick and &s;trong, and by the Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD on his hard Studies, he was furni&s;h'd with that Learning which is requi&s;ite to make a Divine of the fir&s;t Rank. He was well skill'd in the learned Languages; well vers'd in the religious Controver&s;ies that relate either to Points of Doctrine or Church-Government; and was him&s;elf a ready and &s;mart <HI>Di&s;putant,</HI> a wi&s;e and judicious <HI>Ca&s;ui&s;t,</HI> who&s;e Advice and Coun&s;el were much &s;ought and valu'd by the perplex'd and &s;crupulous,</P>
<P>As a <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> he was diligent, laborious, con&s;tant; wi&s;e, faithful, compa&s;&s;ionate. His Sermons were plain and powerful, experimental and &s;piritual, clo&s;e and &s;earching, yet rational and argumentative. His Subjects chiefly &s;uited to awaken &s;ecure Sinners, direct Souls about the great Work of Conver&s;ion, and to help Per&s;ons to judge of their &s;piritual State. And he was favour'd with a more than ordinary Pre&s;ence of GOD in his Work, and many Seals of his Mini&s;try; in the Cour&s;e of which there were three remarkable Sea&s;ons, in which the Spirit of GOD &s;o mov'd upon the Hearts of his People, that it became almo&s;t the general Cry of the Place, <HI>What mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved?</HI> And Con|verts were &s;o numerous, as to give a happy Occa&s;ion for that admiring Que&s;tion, <HI>Who are the&s;e that flie as a Cloud, and as the Doves to their Windows?</HI></P>
<P>HE was a Man zealous again&s;t Sin, a hearty Mourner for the iniquities of the Times, an earne&s;t Pleader with GOD for the Land, the Nation, and His Church in the World.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t in the Town have been born &amp; bro't up under his Mini&s;try; and &s;carce any Mini&s;ter was more reverenc'd and belov'd by his People.</P>
<P>HIS Station was indeed in a remote Corner of the Land, but his Light and Influence went out thro' the whole Country; and <HI>His</HI> being our Pa&s;tor gave a Name and Reputation to the Town.</P>
<P><PB REF="003149_0031_0FF08055810BBEF8">
HE us'd for many Years together to make his Annual Vi&s;its to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> at the time of the Commencement; and the Day after to preach the <HI>Public Lecture,</HI> to a numerous Audience, expecting and glad to hear him.</P>
<P>HIS Labours and U&s;efulne&s;s were drawn out to an uncommon length. For <HI>fifty</HI> Years, or more, he preached twice every LORD's day; and till his 86th Year (in which he died) he was a con&s;tant Preacher one Part of the LORD's-days, and at a monthly-Lecture without the u&s;e of Notes at all; and, in the Opinion of &s;ome good Judges, &s;o well, that it could not be di&s;cern'd his Powers were much abated. And &s;o clo&s;e did he follow his Studies, even in this advanced Age, that when he died he had a con&s;iderable Number of Sermons &s;tudied, that were never preach'd.</P>
<P>HE injoy'd a great mea&s;ure of Health, and was &s;eldom taken off from his beloved Work by Sickne&s;s. His Stature was &s;omething taller then the common Size, his Countenance comely, his Pre&s;ence venerable; his whole Look and Behaviour &s;uch as gave tho&s;e who convers'd with him, occa&s;ion to &s;ay of him, as the Woman of the <HI>Prophet, I perceive that this is a holy Man of God.</HI></P>
<P>THE whole Land has a great Lo&s;s in his Death; for &s;uch Per&s;ons are the <HI>Chariots and Hor&s;emen</HI> of a People, their Glory and Defence.</P>
