<Q><BIBL><HI>PSALM cxxxviii. 2.</HI></BIBL>
<P>&mdash;For Thou ha&s;t magnified thy Word above all thy Name.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THIS is one of <HI>David</HI>'s P&s;alms of Prai&s;e, and it begins magnificently; "<HI>I will prai&s;e Thee with my whole Heart, before the Gods will I &s;ing Prai&s;e unto Thee.</HI> Whether we <HI>pray</HI> to GOD or <HI>prai&s;e</HI> Him, it &s;hould be with our <HI>whole Heart;</HI> with the ut|mo&s;t Devotion of our Souls, all the Faculties and Powers of them being exerted. An <HI>upright</HI> and <HI>fer|vent</HI> Heart in Wor&s;hip, is the <HI>whole</HI> Heart.</P>
<P>"<HI>Before the Gods will I &s;ing Prai&s;e unto thee:</HI> Before the <HI>Angels</HI> &s;ay &s;ome, who&s;e <HI>Pre&s;ence</HI> in the Place of Wor&s;hip was then repre&s;ented by the <HI>Cherubims</HI> over the <HI>Mercy Seat,</HI> and on the <HI>Vail</HI> before it. &mdash; But we may rather under&s;tand the <HI>King</HI> to mean his <HI>Fellow-Princes</HI> and <HI>Potentates</HI> of the Earth, the neighbouring <HI>States</HI> and <HI>Kingdoms</HI> round about him; and al&s;o the
<PB N="6" REF="004916_0004_100E2D972A86DF10">great <HI>A&s;&s;emblies</HI> and Congregation of the <HI>Nobles</HI> and Judges of <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> of whom we read <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 82.1, 6. <HI>GOD &s;tandeth in the Congregation of the mighty, he judgeth among the Gods; I have &s;aid ye are Gods, and all of you Children of the MOST HIGH.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN <HI>David</HI> wrote to <HI>Hiram</HI> of the Greatne&s;s of the <HI>GOD of I&s;rael,</HI> and when <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;hew'd the <HI>Queen of Sheba</HI> how he went up to the Hou&s;e of GOD; then was this Scripture al&s;o fulfilled in the very Letter; "<HI>before the Gods will I prai&s;e Thee.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> goes on, "I will wor&s;hip toward thy holy <HI>Temple,</HI> and prai&s;e thy Name for thy <HI>Loving-kindne&s;s</HI> and for thy <HI>Truth.</HI>" The <HI>Temple</HI> was yet to be built, but the <HI>Tabernacle</HI> or Sanctuary was the &s;ame Thing to GOD and his Wor&s;hippers; and thither they went at the appointed <HI>Times</HI> with the Voice of Prai&s;e; or if they were at a Di&s;tance, they wor&s;hipped <HI>toward</HI> the Place, as <HI>Daniel</HI> did even when it lay in Ruins. <Q><HI>Heaven</HI> is the Holy-place where GOD dwells, and thither we direct our Prayers and look <HI>up;</HI> and CHRIST is our Temple there, and to HIM at the FATHER's <HI>right Hand</HI> we lift up our Souls, and <HI>look</HI> by an Eye of Faith, and our &s;piritual <HI>Sa|crifices</HI> are acceptable.</Q></P>
<P>THE <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> of Prai&s;e follows, "<HI>for thy Loving-kindne&s;s and Truth.</HI> The&s;e are a &s;pecial Part of his <HI>Glory</HI> pa&s;&s;ing before us; "<HI>abundant in Goodne&s;s and in Truth.</HI> &mdash; By <HI>Truth</HI> is meant the <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> that GOD had made and fulfilled to <HI>David;</HI> in the making and performing of which the <HI>Loving-kindne&s;s</HI> of GOD was glorious; <HI>freely</HI> made, and all made <HI>good;</HI> all of Grace, Mercy and Truth, which <HI>David</HI> re&s;olves never to for|get, but ever to give GOD the <HI>Prai&s;e</HI> of. GOD had promi&s;ed him the <HI>Throne,</HI> and had <HI>&s;et</HI> him on it, and now &s;ays he &mdash; "<HI>Before</HI> the Princes <HI>will I &s;ing Prai&s;e to Thee, for thy Loving-kindne&s;s and for thy Truth.</HI></P>

MY <HI>Text</HI> follows, "<HI>For thou ha&s;t magnified thy WORD above all thy Name.</HI> &mdash; GOD's NAME is <HI>mag|nificent</HI> in every glorious <HI>Attribute</HI> and Perfection. He <HI>has</HI> magnified it, and <HI>will</HI> magnify it again. It is <HI>Great</HI> above all the Prai&s;es of Men and Angels.</P>
<P>IN a particular Manner GOD has magnified his <HI>Truth,</HI> that ble&s;&s;ed and Divine <HI>Perfection;</HI> and it is <HI>exalted</HI> infinitely above all that Men can &s;ay or think of it: The <HI>Name</HI> of GOD is <HI>in it;</HI> it is revealed and magnified to us in his <HI>Word:</HI> There e&s;pecially is the Exhibition of his <HI>Loving-kindne&s;s</HI> to the Children of Men. <Q>The <HI>Mercy</HI> of GOD to Mankind, <HI>hid in Him</HI> from before the Foundation of the World is his <HI>Loving-kindne&s;s;</HI> the <HI>Mercy revealed</HI> to us in his <HI>Word</HI> is his <HI>Truth.</HI></Q></P>
<P>IN magnificent Manner GOD has made his <HI>Name,</HI> Him&s;elf, known to us <Q>in the <HI>Works of Creation and Providence;</HI> but mo&s;t of all in his <HI>Word:</HI> The Wonders of <HI>Grace</HI> exceed tho&s;e of <HI>Nature;</HI> the Di&s;|coveries by <HI>Revelation</HI> are much greater than tho&s;e by Rea&s;on.</Q></P>
<P>I SHALL &s;peak of the <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Truth</HI> of GOD in <HI>general;</HI> taking in the Doctrines, Precepts, Promi&s;es, Threatnings, Prophecies and Hi&s;tory of <HI>Scripture;</HI> all which is written for our <HI>Learning,</HI> and to make us <HI>wi&s;e unto Salvation.</HI> In <HI>all</HI> of them together the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD is <HI>magnified.</HI></P>
<P>To <HI>magnify</HI> a Thing is to make it <HI>great, famous, illu&s;trious,</HI> and to put <HI>high Honour</HI> on it. So GOD <HI>has magnified the Law and made it honourable.</HI> I&s;ai. 42.21. &mdash; I &s;hall here &s;ay,</P>
<P N="1">I. The <HI>Word</HI> of GOD is <HI>magnificent in it &s;elf.</HI> As GOD is excellent, &s;o mu&s;t his <HI>Word</HI> be. It is the <HI>Image</HI> and <HI>Picture</HI> of his <HI>Divine Maje&s;ty,</HI> drawn by his own <HI>Pencil;</HI> the <HI>Brightne&s;s of his own Glory</HI> as far as it can be &s;hown <HI>in Words.</HI> Hence CHRIST, the

<P>THE &s;piritual and <HI>moral Glory</HI> of GOD's <HI>Law</HI> is infinite, eternal, ineffable. All the <HI>Beauties</HI> of Know|ledge, Wi&s;dom, Holine&s;s, Ju&s;tice, Goodne&s;s and Truth &s;hine in it.

It <HI>teaches</HI> us how to honour, <HI>wor&s;hip</HI> and &s;erve GOD with Soul and Body, as becomes his infinite Perfection and Glory; and is al&s;o the perfect <HI>Rule</HI> of Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Charity to Men, in what&s;oever <HI>Relation</HI> we &s;tand toward them, or in what&s;oever <HI>Condition</HI> we or they are, or may be.&mdash; It is the <HI>perfect and royal Law of LOVE;</HI> that <HI>radiant Word</HI> wherein <HI>Light dwelleth.</HI> What&s;oever Things are <HI>pure and lovely,</HI> every <HI>Virtue</HI> and every <HI>Prai&s;e,</HI> without any <HI>Darkne&s;s</HI> at all, are written (as with a <HI>Sun-beam</HI>) in this mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Word.</HI> Such is the <HI>Magnificence</HI> of the Holy Word.</P>
<P>IT is the <HI>Law</HI> of the <HI>&s;upreme</HI> GOD, perfectly adapted for his <HI>Empire over Souls,</HI> their Sanctification and eternal Happine&s;s. <Q>A Word every Way &s;uited to the Souls of <HI>Sinners;</HI> a Doctrine of <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> adap|ted to their <HI>Ignorance;</HI> of <HI>Power</HI> adapted to the <HI>ob&s;tinate,</HI> of <HI>Grace</HI> and Mercy to the <HI>guilty</HI> and mi&s;e|rable.

II. GOD has <HI>magnified</HI> it in the <HI>Manner</HI> and <HI>Way</HI> wherein He has <HI>given</HI> it to us. The &s;olemn <HI>Enacting,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing and <HI>Delivery</HI> of the Law puts Grandeur on it. The <HI>GOD of Glory</HI> appear'd to <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> at the burning <HI>Bu&s;h,</HI> and afterward came down on <HI>Sinai</HI> with Thou|&s;ands of his <HI>Angels,</HI> and la&s;tly &s;pake to us by the Mouth of <HI>his own Son,</HI> the <HI>Heir</HI> of all Things; who al&s;o upon his A&s;cention pour'd out the HOLY SPIRIT in <HI>cloven Tongues</HI> of Fire on his <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> and cho&s;en Witne&s;&s;es: And thus GOD has <HI>magnified his Word</HI> to us in the Delivery of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. AT <HI>Sinai,</HI> from the <HI>burning</HI> Mountain, He pro|claim'd his <HI>fiery Law</HI> in <HI>Ten Commandments,</HI> with Sound of <HI>Trumpet,</HI> by the Mouth of his mighty <HI>An|gels!</HI> How awful a <HI>De&s;cent</HI> of the Great GOD! "<HI>Lo, I come to thee in a thick Cloud, that the People may hear when I &s;peak, and believe thee for ever.</HI> This <HI>oral</HI> De|livery of the <HI>Law</HI> was to <HI>magnify</HI> it unto the <HI>Children of I&s;rael;</HI> and it did &s;o; <HI>for all the People in the Camp trembled, even MOSES him&s;elf exceedingly fear'd and quaked:</HI> For the <HI>Mount</HI> was altogether in a <HI>Smoke,</HI> which a&s;cended like that of a <HI>Furnace,</HI> and the whole Mount <HI>quaked</HI> greatly. It was a Day <HI>never</HI> to be for|gotten, <HI>ever</HI> to be kept in Mind by them; <HI>Deut.</HI> iv. 32, 33. <Q><HI>A&s;k</HI> now of the Days that are <HI>pa&s;t,</HI> &s;ince the Day that GOD <HI>created</HI> Man upon the Earth, from the one Side of Heaven to the other, &mdash; did ever People <HI>hear</HI> the Voice of GOD &s;peaking out of the mid&s;t of <HI>Fire,</HI> and live! Unto <HI>thee</HI> it was &s;hewed that thou mighte&s;t know that the LORD he is GOD, there is none el&s;e be&s;ide Him.</Q></P>
<P>INDEED the <HI>Thing</HI> is too great to be amplified on or <HI>magnified</HI> by any Words of Man! It was a kind of <HI>Day of Judgment,</HI> and they that <HI>felt the Terror</HI> of it prayed they might never again &s;ee or hear the like. The <HI>Scripture</HI> abounds in the rhetorical and lofty De|&s;criptions
<PB N="10" REF="004916_0008_100E2DA6B05C5F00">of it;
<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. lxviii. 8. xcvii. 5.</NOTE> <Q>GOD came from <HI>Sinai,</HI> the HOLY ONE from <HI>Mount Seir,</HI> with ten thou&s;and of his Saints; they &s;at down at his Feet, to receive his Words: The Earth &s;hook, even <HI>Sinai</HI> it &s;elf at the Pre&s;ence of the LORD: His <HI>Thunder</HI> was in the Heavens, his <HI>Lightnings</HI> light'ned the World, the Earth <HI>trembled</HI> and &s;hook, and all the People &s;aw his <HI>Glory,</HI> wor&s;hip Him all ye <HI>Gods.</HI></Q></P>

<Q>Let all the <HI>Angels</HI> of GOD wor|&s;hip Him.</Q></Q></P>
<P>THE SON OF GOD took our Nature, to come and <HI>publi&s;h the FATHER's Will</HI> to us: GOD was <HI>manife&s;t in Fle&s;h,</HI> and Men beheld <HI>his Glory,</HI> the Glory as of the "<HI>Only begotten.</HI> The <HI>Law</HI> was given by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> but <HI>Grace</HI> and Truth came by JESUS CHRIST. This is the <HI>Mini&s;tration</HI> that exceeds in <HI>Glory.</HI> This <HI>Man</HI> had more Glory than <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> who was but the <HI>Servant,</HI> HE the LORD in his own Hou&s;e. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> wrote of Him, the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> led to Him, and was fulfilled in Him. At <HI>Sinai</HI> GOD promi&s;ed to rai&s;e up <HI>this Prophet,</HI> as a <HI>greater</HI> Thing than all that they had &s;een
<PB N="11" REF="004916_0009_100E2DAA08597F38">or heard there. For which is greater, GOD in a <HI>Cloud,</HI> or on a fiery <HI>Mountain,</HI> &s;peaking in <HI>Thunder;</HI> or GOD in our <HI>Nature,</HI> found in fa&s;hion as a <HI>Man,</HI> and &s;peaking to us <HI>Face to Face,</HI> with a Man's Mouth? Which is greater, the <HI>Word &s;poken by Angels</HI> with the <HI>Trump</HI> of GOD; or by the Mouth of GOD the <HI>Lord</HI> of Angels, in the <HI>Form of a</HI> Servant? He made his <HI>An|gels</HI> Flames of Fire on <HI>Sinai,</HI> but to the SON it is &s;aid, "<HI>Thy Throne, O GOD, is for ever and ever.</HI> If then the Mini&s;tration of the <HI>Law,</HI> in the <HI>Terrors</HI> of Death, was glorious, the Mini&s;tration of <HI>Life</HI> in the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> of CHRIST exceeds in Glory.</P>
<P>PASS we then from the <HI>burning</HI> Mountain, and the <HI>quaking</HI> Congregation at the Foot of it, to the <HI>Mount</HI> of Grace whereon JESUS far, and the <HI>Multitude</HI> around him, divinely aw'd, and delighted by his heavenly Voice: <HI>Matth.</HI> v. <Q>And he opened his Mouth and taught them, &s;aying, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed</HI> are the <HI>poor</HI> in Spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven; ble&s;&s;ed are the <HI>meek,</HI> for they &s;hall inherit the Earth; ble&s;&s;ed are they that <HI>mourn,</HI> for they &s;hall be comforted, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> Thus GOD having rai&s;ed up JESUS, &s;ent him to <HI>ble&s;s</HI> and &s;ave us. A &s;piritual Eye &s;ees more Glory in this <HI>Di&s;pen&s;ation</HI> of Grace than in all the magnificent Ap|pearances on <HI>Sinai.</HI> A greater than <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> is here.

III. GOD has <HI>magnified</HI> his Word by the <HI>Miracles</HI> with which He has te&s;tified unto it.

This is properly a <HI>Divine Te&s;timony;</HI> and doubtle&s;s if GOD has given a <HI>Revelation</HI> to Mankind, it has been attended with &s;uch his Te&s;timony.

<P>THUS the five <HI>Books of Mo&s;es</HI> are magnified to the <HI>Church</HI> for ever, <Q>in all the <HI>Signs</HI> which GOD &s;ent him to do in the Land of <HI>Egypt,</HI> to <HI>Pharaoh</HI> and all his Servants and in all his Land; and in all that <HI>mighty Hand and great Terror</HI> al&s;o, which he &s;hewed in the Sight of all <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> who when they <HI>&s;aw</HI> the <HI>Miracles</HI> they feared the LORD and believed his Servant. <HI>Exod.</HI> 4.31.</Q></P>
<P>To <HI>magnify</HI> his <HI>Word</HI> it was that GOD divided <Q>the <HI>Sea</HI> before his People, and made the <HI>Waters</HI> to &s;tand as an Heap, while they pa&s;&s;ed thro' as on dry Land: He al&s;o clave the <HI>Rocks</HI> in the De&s;art, and gave them <HI>Drink</HI> as out of the great Depths: He rained <HI>Fle&s;h</HI> upon them as Du&s;t, and feather'd <HI>Fowl</HI> as the Sand of the Sea.</Q> The <HI>Record</HI> of the&s;e Things is magnificent to the <HI>Church</HI> of GOD through all Genera|tions. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 78 and 105.</P>
<P>How was the <HI>Word</HI> of the LORD again magnified, when <HI>Jordan</HI> divided before the <HI>Ark</HI> wherein the <HI>Tables

<P>AND I earne&s;tly exhort the&s;e my <HI>younger Brethren,</HI> together with the very promi&s;ing, &s;tudious and &s;erious <HI>Candidates</HI> for the Mini&s;try now in our <HI>College,</HI> that they <HI>emulate the Learning</HI> and <HI>Labours</HI> of the pre&s;ent <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> of the <HI>Churches</HI> round about them; and yet more tho&s;e of the FIRST FATHERS of our <HI>Country;</HI> who with equal Care and <HI>Speed</HI> founded our Churches, <HI>Schools</HI> and Colleges together, and never &s;eparated their <HI>Bibles</HI> and <HI>Literature</HI> in their Preparations for public Serviceablene&s;s, but kept the <HI>one</HI> in reverend <HI>Subjection</HI> to the other. &mdash; So my SONS, do you &s;tudy your <HI>Bibles</HI> fir&s;t and mo&s;t, and then <HI>u&s;e</HI> all your Acqui&s;itions of <HI>humane</HI> Knowledge, and your peculiar <HI>natural</HI> Gifts and Powers, whether of <HI>Rea&s;oning</HI> or <HI>Oratory,</HI> to re|commend and inforce the <HI>lively Oracles</HI> of GOD to the <HI>Under&s;tanding</HI> and on the <HI>Affections</HI> of tho&s;e to whom you may be called to mini&s;ter. &mdash; For if you go off from <HI>&s;tudied Sermons,</HI> you will I fear <HI>lo&s;e</HI> all that the <HI>Fathers</HI> of the&s;e Churches have wrought for us; and
<PB N="31" REF="004916_0029_100E2DE6D0DCE500">will come (unlike <HI>them</HI>) to this People, with empty Noi&s;e of Addre&s;s to their <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions only,</HI> which is not the Way of your <HI>Bible,</HI> nor of the HOLY SPIRIT who in&s;pir'd it, who by the Under&s;tanding enters the <HI>Heart,</HI> convincing Men of <HI>Sin,</HI> of <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Judgment,</HI> their lo&s;t and peri&s;hing State, and Need of a SAVIOUR.</P>
<P>LET me recommend to <HI>you</HI> Dr. WATTS his <HI>hum|ble Attempt for the Revival of Religion;</HI> a <HI>Book</HI> worthy to be read and deeply con&s;ider'd by <HI>Mini&s;ters and Peo|ple;</HI> and in a particular Manner by the <HI>Candidates</HI> for the Evangelical Mini&s;try, before they enter on the Work of Preaching; that in their Compo&s;ures they may <HI>equally</HI> remember how much they have to do with the <HI>Mind</HI> and Under&s;tanding, and al&s;o with the <HI>Hearts</HI> and Con&s;ciences of their Hearers; and with HIM that <HI>made</HI> Man's Heart and <HI>&s;earches</HI> it, and only can reach and <HI>change</HI> it: Accordingly "<HI>methodize,</HI> explain, illu&s;|trate, prove, infer upon and <HI>apply</HI> the Subjects which you undertake, as in the Fear of GOD you truly judge will <HI>mo&s;t magnify the Word</HI> you preach, and <HI>benefit</HI> the Souls of Men. &mdash; To which <HI>End</HI> al&s;o I do with like Earne&s;tne&s;s recommend to <HI>Students</HI> and younger <HI>Mini|&s;ters</HI> (and al&s;o to private <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI>) a like admirable Book of Dr. WATTS's, of the "<HI>U&s;e and Abu&s;e of the Pa&s;&s;ions in Matters of Religion;</HI> as &s;urpri&s;ingly calculated for our <HI>In&s;truction</HI> and <HI>Admonition</HI> at this Day.</P>
<P>AND &s;uffer me, my <HI>dear People,</HI> now I am it may be taking Leave of this <HI>De&s;k,</HI> in a particular Manner to intimate to you my Apprehen&s;ion and <HI>Fear</HI> of great <HI>Di&s;honour to the Word of GOD,</HI> and of <HI>Danger</HI> to your <HI>Souls</HI> and tho&s;e of your <HI>Families,</HI> and therefore of <HI>Ruin</HI> to the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> if we give Counte|nance and Encouragement to <HI>illiterate</HI> and <HI>half-learnt</HI> Per&s;ons to go about <HI>exhorting</HI> and drawing <HI>Hearers</HI> by their <HI>Shew of Affection</HI> to Souls for their &s;piritual Profit and &s;aving Good, or from their <HI>&s;incere De&s;ire</HI> thereof; for it certainly <HI>tends</HI> in Time to run the Churches into
<PB N="32" REF="004916_0030_100E2DE99769C640"><HI>Confu&s;ion,</HI> and to bring the <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> of the Word into <HI>Contempt.</HI> &mdash; I mu&s;t needs therefore <HI>repeat</HI> my <HI>public Caution</HI> to you &s;ome <HI>Months</HI> ago, <Q>that you would no more <HI>run</HI> from your own <HI>Pa&s;tors</HI> with &s;uch open Di&s;re&s;pect after every <HI>new</HI> Face or fervent Voice, with far le&s;s Furniture for your real &s;piritual Edifica|tion.</Q> We may well blu&s;h for &s;ome who have &s;at &s;o long, and profited &s;o well, under our Mini&s;try, and yet have no more attained to a true Ta&s;te and Judgment. Your <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> have been and are, from Time to Time, earne&s;tly and powerfully addre&s;&s;ing to your <HI>Affections</HI> and Pa&s;&s;ions as well as <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> with a <HI>di&s;tinct</HI> Sound and <HI>&s;uperiour</HI> Light, &s;uch as no <HI>uncertain</HI> Fla&s;hes out of Clouds and Darkne&s;s may at all compare with.</P>
<P>I <HI>clo&s;e</HI> with giving <HI>Glory</HI> to GOD for the <HI>Great and good Work of his Grace,</HI> which He has &s;o <HI>vi&s;ibly begun, &s;pread</HI> and is <HI>carrying on,</HI> in every <HI>Part</HI> almo&s;t of our <HI>Provinces;</HI> which that <HI>we may all</HI> in our re&s;pective Places <HI>&s;ub&s;erve,</HI> under the <HI>&s;pecial Direction,</HI> Re&s;traint, Influence and Enlargement of the BLESSED SPIRIT <HI>of Truth, Holine&s;s and Love;</HI> (WHOM I &s;incerely and mo&s;t thankfully de&s;ire to <HI>adore</HI> as "<HI>magnifying</HI> therein <HI>his Word above all his Name</HI>) is I hope my <HI>&s;ingle Aim</HI> in what I have now &s;aid; &mdash; and may all the <HI>Churches</HI> &s;ay, AMEN, <HI>prai&s;e ye the</HI> LORD.</P>
