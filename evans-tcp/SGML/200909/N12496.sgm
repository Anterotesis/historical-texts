<HEAD>A SERMON.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a pa&s;&s;age in Sacred Writ, which has been revived in my remembrance during the &s;ilence of this meeting, and the train of reflections which it ex|cited, has &s;eal'd in&s;truction to my mind, and furni&s;h'd me with renewed cau&s;e of humiliation and gratitude; <HI>"Men and Brethren, what &s;hall we do to be &s;aved?"</HI></P>
<P>Every per&s;on who &s;eriou&s;ly believes in the exi&s;tence of a God, in a future &s;tate, and in the awful doctrine of rewards and puni&s;hments, cannot be indifferent re|&s;pecting what may be his lot, when he &s;hall be di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this frail Tabernacle of clay which he now inhabits, and which is approaching to the period of its di&s;&s;oluti|on; it cannot be a matter of indifference to him, whether he &s;hall finally receive the irrevocable &s;entence of "go ye cur&s;ed into the regions of irremediable mi&s;ery;" or <Q>come ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for the righteous, enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord, and into thy ma&s;ters re&s;t.</Q> This concern has prompted many to enquire what is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary for them to believe and practi&s;e in order to render them the proper objects of divine complacence and furni&s;h them with a well grounded hope of a glorious and hap|py immortality. Many of the hone&s;t and &s;incere of eve|ry Nation under Heaven, have formed different ideas
<PB N="4" REF="015796_0003_0F9A2BD8D18C66B0">of the requi&s;ites to &s;alvation, and of cour&s;e have <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> as different mea&s;ures to accompli&s;h that de&s;irable end. It is not my pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s, to particularize any of tho&s;e various &s;y&s;tems of Faith, which are adopted by any par|ty among&s;t mankind; it is not to controvert matters, in which &s;incere men of the various denominations mo&s;t &s;urely believe; but rather to recommend them always to &s;tand open to conviction, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> attention to tho&s;e rules of conduct, which appear to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> mo&s;t agrea|ble to the will of Heaven. I &s;hall therefore addre&s;s my|&s;elf to tho&s;e, in whatever religious &s;ociety they are found, who&s;e hone&s;t inquiries have not yet been attend|ed with &s;ufficient conviction, or led them clearly to per|ceive what are the terms on which their future hap|pine&s;s depends, and who are therefore looking one upon another, whil&s;t this important que&s;tion is found, at lea&s;t in their hearts if not in their mouths <Q>Men and Bre|thren what &s;hall we do to be &s;aved?</Q></P>
<P>I &s;hall not pre&s;ume arrogantly to dictate to any re&s;pect|ing matters of &s;o important a concern as that of the &s;alva|tion of the Soul; every Man &s;hould exerci&s;e tho&s;e talents with which the Father of lights has endued him, in a clo&s;e and &s;incere attention to the voice of the internal Teacher, and in the di&s;covery of tho&s;e truths both prac|tical and &s;peculative which have an immediate relation to the happine&s;s of a Being circum&s;tanced as he is. I &s;hall &s;imply propo&s;e tho&s;e things which from my own expe|rience as an individual appear to me worthy of God for their Author, and worthy of Man's mo&s;t &s;erious atten|tion. It is an indi&s;putable truth that we made not our|&s;elves: <Q>We are thine offspring, thou ha&s;t made us and not we our&s;elves,</Q> &s;ays the prophet in his appeal to God. The matter which forms the univer&s;e, the vehicles which the &s;oul informs, and the intellectual powers and facul|ties we po&s;&s;e&s;s, derived their being from the eternal maintain of all power and intelligence, whom we cha|racterize
<PB N="5" REF="015796_0004_0F9A2BD991978658">by the awful names of Jah, Jehovah and God. It is al&s;o clear to me that we were brought into exi&s;tence with the benevolent de&s;ign of finally &s;u&s;taining the con|fluent dignities of Glory, Honour, Immortality and eter|nal Life; the Lord Almighty hath in un&s;peakable mercy promi&s;ed, that after we have endured a &s;ea&s;on of proba|tion on earth, a conflict with our pa&s;&s;ions excited by numerous cau&s;es, and a fight of afflictions, we &s;hould finally receive a glorious reward, a perpetuity of un|mixed felicity in the unknown regions of eternity. But this de&s;irable and excellent end is not to be effected, by what is generally call'd fate, the laws of nece&s;&s;ity, or the arbitrary will and power of the Author of our exi&s;tence. God has con&s;tituted us free and intelligent beings, and endued us with faculties capable of apprehending and practi&s;ing tho&s;e duties which he makes the condition of our final acceptance with him he offers, but does not im|po&s;e, happine&s;s on his creatures; he &s;hows us the &s;piritual Canaan, he gives us power to po&s;&s;e&s;s it, but does not compel us to enter into it; good and evil are clearly &s;et before us, but our election is not con&s;trained to either; the &s;overeign of the univer&s;e is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons, for of one blood he made all nations that dwell on the face of the earth; they &s;tand in the &s;ame relation to the univer&s;al Father, Shepherd and Bi&s;hop of Souls, who tenderly invites the whole race of Mankind to inherit the Joy of his Salvation. To this doctrine the holy Apo&s;tle bore an ample and explicit te&s;timony: <Q>Of a truth, &s;aid he, I perceive that God is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons, but in every nation tho&s;e who fear him and work righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall be accepted of him.</Q>&mdash; <Q>If ye live after the fle&s;h ye &s;hall die, but if through the &s;pirit ye mortify the deeds of the body, ye &s;hall live.</Q> This is a propo&s;ition that relates to every individual in the va&s;t community of Mankind, however circum&s;tan|ced, whether bond or free, or in whatever climate he re&s;ides.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="015796_0005_0F9A2BDA4F2A2BF0">
All this indeed may be acknowledg'd both by tho&s;e within and without the audience of my voice, who are yet in doubt what they &s;hall do to be &s;aved with an everla&s;ting &s;alvation; they want to be intormed of the preci&s;e ideas that &s;hould be affixed to the conditions contained in the text, though perhaps they readily ap|prehend the terms life and death imply future happine&s;s and mi&s;ery. I &s;hall therefore attempt according to the ability I am endued with, to give you my thoughts on the important &s;ubject in que&s;tion at this time. To "live after the fle&s;h" is to live in the gratification of our animal appetites and pa&s;&s;ions, beyond the bounds of rea&s;on, temperance and &s;obriety, which as it frequently introduces numerous di&s;orders into the animal &s;y&s;tem, and aggravates the infirmities to which the&s;e corruptible bodies are incident, &s;o it affects the good of &s;ociety, and renders unfit for tho&s;e contemplations and that felicity which is adapted to the dignity of rational and immortal &s;pirits, beings whom God in his wi&s;dom has made a little (and perhaps but a little) lower than the Angels, and who would crown them with a &s;uperior glory, honour and happine&s;s than that which animal gratifications can con|fer on their deluded votaries. Whil&s;t we are in the body we mu&s;t expect to find tho&s;e appetites, affections and pa&s;|&s;ions which belong to our nature; but the&s;e are to be re&s;tricted within the bounds of virtue, and attended to in proportion to our exigencies and nece&s;&s;ities, of which the divine principle which God has graciou&s;ly implanted in our hearts ought to determine.</P>
<P>This principle of intelligence although call'd by a variety of names in the different profe&s;&s;ions among&s;t Men, is the &s;ame in nature throughout all Mankind. It is the &s;pirit in Man that giveth a right under&s;tanding; it is the light that more or le&s;s enlightens every Man; it is the word of God in the heart; the word of faith which the Apo&s;tle preach'd to the Gentiles; it is the
<PB N="7" REF="015796_0006_0F9A2BDB0F3CB9F0">Grace that hath appear'd to all Men, teaching them to deny ungodline&s;s and the worlds ju&s;ts, and to live &s;o|berly, righteou&s;ly and godly in this pre&s;ent world; and finally it is the &s;upreme rea&s;on, the law of truth and rec|titude, the te&s;t of virtue and vice, which God him&s;elf hath erected in the hearts of all Men; and happy are tho&s;e who hear and obey it in all things.</P>
<P>I would not be under&s;tood to mean that this principle of which I am &s;peaking is de&s;igned to in&s;truct us in all truths which the human mind may attempt to inve&s;ti|gate, or to give a clear in&s;ight into tho&s;e numerous &s;pe|culative &s;ubjects, which have, not only unprofitably em|ploy'd mankind and diverted their attention from more &s;ub&s;tantial objects, but which have perplexed and divid|ed them from generation to generation; but by the exerci&s;e of it we may apprehend tho&s;e truths that belong to us, and have an e&s;&s;ential relation to the important end of our exi&s;tence; of which truths the Father of &s;pirits has enabled us to judge; this is imply'd by the que&s;tion which our Lord him&s;elf propo&s;ed to a people mi&s;led by the traditions of their fathers, and who had taken for doctrine the commandments of men, <Q>yea and why judge ye not for your&s;elves, what is right?</Q></P>
<P>Various are our obligations and duties, religious, rela|tive and &s;ocial, ari&s;ing trom our various connections, natural and divine: The relation we &s;tand in to the Au|thor of our being is that of Children; filial fear, obedi|ence and wor&s;hip is therefore our indi&s;pen&s;ible duty to him, in our conduct at all times, throughout our whole lives. The relation which our fellow creatures &s;tand in to us is that of brethren, children of the &s;ame univer&s;al Father, and formed for the &s;ame glorious and happy and; ju&s;tice, charity and brotherly kindne&s;s are there|fore our indi&s;pen&s;able obligations unto mankind. There are al&s;o various accidental relations, &s;uch as father, governor, ma&s;ter, &s;ervant and numerous others, all
<PB N="8" REF="015796_0007_0F9A2BDBCF8D9140">which have their core&s;pondent duties. Thus far per|haps the per&s;ons whom I immediately addre&s;s at this time may concur with me in &s;entiment, but they as well as I, are perhaps con&s;cious of having fail'd in nume|rous in&s;tances of di&s;charging their religious duties to God and their &s;ocial duties to mankind. We have all &s;inned and fallen &s;hort of the glory of God! we have multiplied our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions without number! and our iniquities ri&s;e before us as a thick cloud! which ob&s;cures the brightne&s;s of that eternal Sun of righteou&s;ne&s;s, which would otherwi&s;e illuminate our under&s;tandings with its marvellous light. Who, therefore, (&s;ays the illuminated penitent &s;oul) &s;hall deliver us from the body of this death? who &s;hall take from us the weight of our &s;ins under which we groan ince&s;&s;antly? who &s;hall &s;ave us from the wrath to come? "Men and Brethren what &s;hall we do to be &s;aved?" The condition of our recon|ciliation and redemption are very clearly expre&s;s'd in the &s;acred oracles of truth; the placability of the divine nature is repeatedly a&s;&s;erted; he is repre&s;ented to us in the adorable character of a God of mercy, long &s;uffer|ing and of un&s;peakable kindne&s;s; as a Being ready to blot out our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions from the cele&s;tial regi&s;ter, on our &s;incere repentance, and to remember them no more.</P>
<P>This important and intere&s;ting doctrine was typified under the Law, &s;poken of by the Prophets, and glori|ou&s;ly a&s;&s;erted by the Son of God, who is our Mediator with the Father, and the hope of our future Glory. In his character was di&s;played to Mankind, in the mo&s;t eminent and &s;triking manner, the provident care, mercy and goodne&s;s of God toward the whole rational creati|on; who like &s;heep have gone a&s;tray from the univer&s;al &s;hepherd and bi&s;hop of Souls, who have widely wan|dered from the paths of purity and holine&s;s, which are ways of plea&s;antne&s;s and peace; that path of the
<PB N="9" REF="015796_0008_0F9A2BDC9091FD38">ju&s;t Man, which (like the luminous orb as it ari&s;es in our hemi&s;phere) &s;hines with increa&s;ing refulgency, &s;plendour and brightne&s;s, till it arrives at the meridian altitude of a gloriou&s;ly perfect day! This path leads all who &s;teadily pur&s;ue its direction, by degrees of experi|ence, through the wilderne&s;s of this world to the grand and ultimate end of our Creation, to that compleat frui|tion of bli&s;s that is figuratively repre&s;ented to us by <Q>a City that hath foundations, who&s;e builder and ma|ker God is;</Q> a City <Q>who&s;e Walls are &s;alvation, and who&s;e Gates are eternal prai&s;e;</Q> a City that hath no need of the elementary light of Sun, Moon and Stars, "for the Lord God and the Lamb are the light thereof" a City where God reigns triumphantly among&s;t his &s;aints, and is to them an inexhau&s;tible fountain of light and felicity; there the weary pilgrim finds an end of all his anxiety and labour, and receives the reward of his faith, the fruition of his hopes, even the &s;alvation of his Soul.</P>
<P>The important me&s;&s;age which Chri&s;t had in commi&s;|&s;ion from his Father and our Father, from his God and our God, was, that he compa&s;&s;ionated his Creatures, encompa&s;s'd with the di&s;tre&s;&s;es which their &s;ins had brought upon them, that he will'd not their everla&s;ting &s;eparation from him the &s;ource of happine&s;s, that he was willing they &s;hould be reconciled to him; he there|fore call'd upon them to <HI>Repent and be converted that their &s;ins might be forgiven them, and that they might finally enter into his re&s;t.</HI> This was the intere&s;ting doc|trine which the Saviour of Man promulgated, and hap|py are tho&s;e who hear and obey it. <Q>Repent and be converted that your &s;ins may be forgiven you.</Q> It is not the a&s;&s;ent of the lip and of the tongue to the glorious truths of the Go&s;pel; but a &s;urrender of the will and affections, a renovation of heart, and conform|ity to the divine Image, which can alone gain us admi&s;|&s;ion into the New Jeru&s;alem, the City of God.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="015796_0009_0F9A2BDDCCA75588">
If we take an impartial &s;urvey of our pa&s;t lives, re|view our frequent revoltings, and compare our conduct with the convictions we have often received of right and wrong, virtue and vice, there is &s;carcely a Soul pre&s;ent but mu&s;t feel &s;ome degree of remor&s;e, &s;ome de|gree of repentance for the turpitude of his morals, and his want of love, obedience and gratitude to &s;o gracious a Father, who has encompa&s;s'd us with ble&s;&s;ings, and pre&s;erved us by his providence from the earlie&s;t period of our lives to the pre&s;ent hour; we mu&s;t (I &s;ay again) upon &s;erious retro&s;pection, po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome degree of re|pentance; but unhappily for us the impre&s;&s;ions that are made on our minds by &s;uch a review of our actions, are frequently era&s;ed by the influence which a variety of creaturely objects are &s;uffer'd to have upon us, and like the early dew they &s;oon pa&s;s away. Tho&s;e who have been clean&s;ed in &s;ome degree by the water of con|trition, are often de&s;iled again by the repetition of that iniquity which in the moments of their humilia|tion they had determined to renounce and for&s;ake, they are again caught in the &s;nare of their lu&s;ts, and capti|vated by tho&s;e objects which have a tendency to alienate their affections from the &s;upreme good. Thus when the force of conviction again &s;ounds the awakning alarm, they are ready to query with &s;urpri&s;e and anx|iety <Q>what is to be done in this afflictive dilemma to which our incon&s;tancy to our virtuous re&s;olutions has reduced us? &s;hall we de&s;pair of that divine mercy we have &s;o often abu&s;ed of that goodne&s;s we have &s;o long trifled with?</Q> God forbid! rather pro&s;trate your Souls at the Throne of Grace, and humbly im|plore the continued mercy of the univer&s;al parent, as a Father pitieth his Children, &s;o he pitieth them that fear him; he knoweth our frame, he remembereth that we are but du&s;t; be&s;eech him therefore to &s;end forth help from his holy &s;anctuary, that you may be &s;trength|ned
<PB N="11" REF="015796_0010_0F9A2BDE10F80650">to renew and keep your Covenants with him; re|frain from the commi&s;&s;ion or evil, and wait on him in the &s;ilence of all fle&s;h; &s;ince it hath plea&s;ed him again to enlighten your darkne&s;s, and thus to give you to &s;ee your&s;elves as you are &s;een of him; he may al&s;o be plea&s;|ed to inflame your hearts with that cele&s;tial fire which purgeth away all the intellectual &s;ith and dro&s;s, that prevents the a&s;cent of the Soul godward, and renders it an un&s;it habitation for his holine&s;s to dwell in. As our back&s;lidings have frequently corrected us and co|ver'd our minds with anxiety, let our future conduct directed by his Grace, atone for what is pa&s;s'd, and by a conver&s;ation ordered aright, let us glority our Father who is in Heaven.</P>
<P>I feel at this &s;ea&s;on the influence (in degree) of that cele&s;tial Charity which breathes through Immanuel to the whole creation of God, wi&s;hing &s;alvation to every Soul that inhabits the earth; in which I intreat you (as a being &s;ubject to the &s;ame infirmities which you &s;ometimes unavailably deplore) <Q>repent and be conver|ted;</Q> repentance you have frequently experienced, but too little I fear of that e&s;&s;ential conver&s;ion which the Go&s;pel of Je&s;us propo&s;es, 'tis highly probable that &s;ome per&s;ons pre&s;ent have &s;een the nece&s;&s;ity of that reno|vation of heart and reformation of manners intended by conver&s;ion, but urged by the powerful prevalency of their lu&s;ts, would if po&s;&s;ible find &s;ome other remedy for a wounded con&s;cience, than that which the &s;implicity of the Go&s;pel requires, as a nece&s;&s;ary prelude to the favour of God; like the young Man in the Go&s;pel, they have been animated with a de&s;ire to be enroll'd among&s;t the di&s;ciples of Je&s;us, who are called Heirs of God and Co-heirs with Chri&s;t of that inheritance which is incorruptable and full of Giory; they have a&s;ked coun&s;el of the wonderful coun&s;ellor, addre&s;ling him with this important que&s;tion, <Q>what good thing &s;hall I do,
<PB N="12" REF="015796_0011_0F9A2BDECFE5D300">that I may inherit eternal life?</Q> yet when the un|changable terms of &s;alvation have been propo&s;ed, when they have been 'told that they mu&s;t part with all their Idols, they have gone away &s;orrowful, the terms have appear'd too hard for them to comply with; and like Naaman who wanted to be cur'd of his Lepro&s;y, and was &s;tagger'd at the thought of taking &s;o long a journey as the Prophet directed, are crying out <Q>are not Abana and Pharphar rivers of Dama&s;cus better than all the waters of I&s;rael, may I not wa&s;h in them and be clean?</Q> thus numbers among&s;t Mankind are &s;triving to elude the mea&s;ures which the Go&s;pel of Je&s;us enjoins, and are &s;ub&s;tituting others in their &s;tead, which are better adapted to &s;ooth the carnal mind, and pre|vent that mortification which human nature &s;hrinks from.</P>
<P>Man is de&s;irous to po&s;&s;e&s;s the crown of eternal life, but not to bear the Cro&s;s; he would indeed reign with Chri&s;t, but not &s;uffer with him; he would accompany him to the mount of transfiguration, but not to Gol|gotha; he would be his attendant at his Glorification, but not in the awful &s;cene of his Humiliation.</P>
<P>Divers have wander'd as from mountain to moun|tain and from hill to hill, &s;eeking for the living in the Sepulchres of the Dead, they have &s;ometimes adpoted one creed, and &s;ometimes another, practi&s;ed external ordinances, and comply'd with empty forms, addre&s;|&s;ing them&s;elves frequently to guides as blind and im|potent as them&s;elves with this awful enquiry <Q>Men and Brethren what &s;hall we do to be &s;aved?</Q> "I &s;ay again, "repent and be converted," for this is the only way to find &s;alvation to your Souls; no external ceri|monies, no verbal confe&s;&s;ions, nor any change of opi|nions merely, can accompli&s;h this repentance and con|ver&s;ion, and afford you the con&s;equent reward of a glorious immortallity, this important work of &s;alvation

<P>In the world there are many voices which corre&s;pond not with the voice of Chri&s;t, the only Shepherd of Souls (whom we ought to hear and obey in all things) but are the voices of tho&s;e who preach for hire and divine for Money; who look for their gain from their re&s;pec|tive quarters; and as to &s;uch con&s;cien ous Men who cannot put into their mouths, they are ready to make war again&s;t them; the&s;e have found it for their worldly intere&s;t to lead the deluded people from, rather than to Chri&s;t, that glorious High Prie&s;t of the Chri&s;tian Religion; they have attempted to render that my&s;terious which the Holy Gho&s;t has left clear, and to perplex the under|&s;tandings of Mankind with vain metaphy&s;ical &s;peculati|ons, without making them either wi&s;er or better. This cla&s;s of Men who&s;e God is their belly, and who&s;e Glory is their &s;hame, have indeed proved phy&s;icians of no real value; in&s;tead of laying the Axe to the root of the corrupt Tree, they have only attempted to lop off &s;ome of its branches; they have pre&s;cribed emolients, where the mo&s;t &s;earching <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> were expedient; and healing the wound of the daughter of Zion deceit|fully have lull'd multitudes into a fatal &s;ecurity, flatter|ing them with hopes which it is to be fear'd will finally end in di&s;appointment.

<P>Let it not be thought from any thing I have &s;aid, that I look upon all tho&s;e who appear girded with the linen Ephod, of other Chri&s;tian &s;ocieties, either as Impo&s;tors, or the deluded votaries of Antichri&s;t; I free|ly declare, that I doubt not but many of them have had a di&s;pen&s;ation of the Go&s;pel committed to them, and although they may be bias'd by the prejudice of education and the traditions of their Fathers, yet the root of the matter &s;eems to be in them; and I e&s;teem the&s;e (in whatever &s;ociety they are found or in whatever ve&s;tments they are cloath'd) as my Brethren in the fel|low&s;hip of the everla&s;ting Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t; yet I can|not direct the &s;earcher after truth who is pen&s;ively enquir|ing what he &s;hall do to be &s;aved, to the Mini&s;try of any Man; but would rather recommend him to the immediate teaching of the word nigh in the heart, even the &s;pirit of God; this is the only infallible teacher, the primary adequate rule of faith and practice, and will lead tho&s;e who attend to its dictates into the peaceable
<PB N="15" REF="015796_0014_0F9A2BE1100F1968">paths of &s;afety and of truth. <Q>Ye need not (&s;ays the holy Apo&s;tle to the Church formerly) that any Man teach you, &s;ave as this anointing teacheth, which is truth and no lie;</Q> cea&s;e therefore from Man who&s;e breath is in his no&s;trils, and who&s;e exi&s;tence is but a vapour, for wherein is he to be accounted of? as a falli|ble being he is liable to frequent deceptions, and there|fore liable to deceive; whereas the &s;pirit of God cannot be deceived, neither will it deceive any Soul that yields it&s;elf to its Government and obeys its dictates.</P>
<P>O ye penitent Prodigals! my Soul earne&s;tly longs for your re&s;toration to the mercy and favour of God! ye who are reduced by your wanderings in the wilderne&s;s of this world to a &s;tate of extream poverty, to the want of that bread that comes down from the cele&s;tial Regions above, which alone can nouri&s;h the Soul up unto eternal Life! ye who are attempting to &s;atisfy the cravings of an immortal &s;pirit with the &s;piritle&s;s hu&s;ks and &s;hells of an empty profe&s;&s;ion of Religion! look towards your Father from whom you have revolted; remember that in his Hou&s;e there is bread enough and to &s;pare; there your Souls may be repleni&s;h'd with ever enduring &s;ub&s;tance: Return, O Hou&s;e of I&s;rael! and &s;eek the face of your everla&s;ting friend and Father! he has in un&s;peakable kindne&s;s declared that he will be found of tho&s;e who &s;eek him in &s;incerity of heart, and that as many as knock at the Gate of mercy for an entrance, &s;hall be admitted to his pre&s;ence, and receive the remi&s;&s;ion of their Sins.</P>
<P>The humble addre&s;s which the Prodigal made to his Father (in that excellent parable given us by Chri&s;t) the Father's return to it, and the manner of his reception into favour, is exceedingly expre&s;&s;ive of the becoming, penitence of the one and the mercy of the other; <Q>I have &s;inned again&s;t Heaven and in thy &s;ight, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son, make me

<P>Before I conclude, I find it in my Heart to addre&s;s another cla&s;s in this Meeting, a cla&s;s who have earne&s;tly &s;ought and happily found him of whom Mo&s;es and the Prophets did write, Je&s;us of Nazareth the Immanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us; you who once were &s;catter'd as &s;heep without a &s;hepherd, on the barren mountains and de&s;olate hills of an empty profe&s;|&s;ion, but the Great Shepherd of Souls hath gather'd you within the &s;acred Inclo&s;ure of his Sheepfold, and you are under the peculiar protection of the Lord Almighty, you hath he pluck'd as brands out of the burning, and redeem'd to him&s;elf with the &s;aving &s;trength of his right Arm; may you ever remember his unutterable mercy, and dedicate the remaining moments of life to the honour of his Name. My Soul &s;alutes you in the endear'd affection of the Go&s;pel of peace, and wi&s;hes your e&s;tabli&s;hment in Righteou&s;ne&s;s, that you may abide in holy patience the fiery tryal of your faith through|out the days of your Pilgrimage on earth, and become as fixed pillars in the cele&s;tial building, the hou&s;e of God, that &s;hall go no more out.</P>
<P>If ye abide in the word of faith by which ye have been taught, the malice of Men nor Devils, nor all the united powers of darkne&s;s, &s;hall be able to pluck you out of the hand of him, who is your Judge, your King your Protector, your Father and your everla&s;ting Friend When the earth &s;hall be wrap'd together as a &s;croll, and the Sun and Moon be darkned, when every Con&s;tella|tion

<P>Many of pretended wi&s;e, learned and prudent who have &s;ought to climb up &s;ome other way, rather than to enter by Chri&s;t, who is the door (by the conditions which he has propo&s;ed) into the &s;heepfold, may pity you as fools, or ridicule you as enthu&s;ia&s;ts, count your lives madne&s;s, and your end to be without honour, but they will one day be a&s;toni&s;h'd at the &s;trangene&s;s of your Salvation, when they &s;ee to their confu&s;ion that you are finally number'd among&s;t the Children of God, and that the lot of your Inheritance is among&s;t the Saints. In the World you are to expect tribulations of various kinds; pain, &s;ickne&s;s, temptations and di&s;ap|pointments invade the brea&s;t of the mo&s;t righteous and temperate among&s;t Men; the cup of mixture (more or le&s;s impregnated with the wormwood and the gall) is the lot of all Men, de&s;ign'd doubtle&s;s to affect a value|able purpo&s;e, by him who afflicts not willingly, nor without a righteous and benevolent cau&s;e, the Children of Men; as the Heavens are higher than the Earth &s;o are the ways of Almighty Wi&s;dom higher than our ways, and his thoughts than our thoughts! We &s;ee a little, and but a very little of the amazing univer&s;al plan of his Government over rational and immortal &s;pirits. It lies beyond the reach of the mo&s;t exalted human faculties to comprehend his wi&s;dom, throughout the righteous admini&s;tration of his Providence, which is un&s;earchable! It is our duty as frail dependant beings to meet every di&s;pen&s;ation of his Providence with that re&s;ignation of &s;pirit, which ince&s;&s;antly breathes the hum|ble language of "not my will O Lord! but thine, be done in all things!" Under the evils which we feel and

This is not the place of your re&s;t, but a &s;tate of probation, a painful pilgrimage, a Land of pits and &s;nares, through which lies a narrow Path to the regions of eternal Peace.</P>
<P>The Soul by rea&s;on of its connection, with the body, inclo&s;ed within the walls of fle&s;h, cannot extend its views and employ its faculties on divine objects, without frequent interruption; but when the days of its captivity are accompli&s;h'd, it will be capable of a more glorious expan&s;ion in the Kingdom of Immortallity, and (if bear|ing the in&s;cription of Holine&s;s) will be put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that Joy which is un&s;peakable and full of Glory. Therefore in all tho&s;e calunities to which we are &s;ubject in the hou&s;e of our pilgrimage, we have a place of re|fuge to flee to, where &s;afety is alone to be four is though indeed we mu&s;t feel in degred as Men, yet <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> may po&s;|&s;e&s;s the patience, re&s;ignation and holy <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of Chri&s;tians, who are looking for a better Country, a more excellent Inheritance in that City who&s;e Inhabitant cannot &s;ay "I am Sick."</P>
<P>Be ye therefore &s;tedfa&s;t, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, fora&s;much as ye know than your labour &s;hall not be in vain. Be ye in your &s;everal &s;tations in the Church, and the world, as way-marks to the hone&s;t inquirers who are a&s;king their way to Zion, and from a true &s;en&s;e of their condition are crying out "what &s;hall we do to be &s;aved?" &s;hew forth by your example of Charity, Sobriety, Temperance and Holi|ne&s;s of Life, that you are redeem'd from the &s;pirit of the world, that lies in wickedne&s;s; be not captivated by
<PB N="19" REF="015796_0018_0F9A2BE410099740">its tri&s;ling amu&s;ements, nor in&s;anred by its lying vani|ties, but retain the fear of the Lord which will keep the heart clean, and prove a &s;ource of &s;ure&s;t con&s;olation when all things el&s;e will be unavailing! let the purity of your lives demon&s;trate that you are attentive to things more excellent, things that are permanent and eternal, e&s;&s;entially relating to the &s;alvation of the Soul! by this means you will become the con&s;ecrated Temples of the Holy Gho&s;t, and be a means of leading others in the way of Righteou&s;ne&s;s!</P>
<P>Finally, my Brethren, farewell!

<P>A SOLEMN &s;ummons which the Almighty gave through his Prophet Joel, to a People whom he had known above all the families of the Earth, (at a time when they had revolted and departed in Heart from him) has been revived in my mind; with an ap|prehen&s;ion that the &s;ame authority requires the repub|lication of it in this day, to a People likewi&s;e highly favour'd of him; and who have in like manner depart|ed from their fir&s;t love.</P>

As I am about to conclude (perhaps finally conclude) my labours among&s;t you in this Quarter; I would que|ry with &s;ome, with many that are pre&s;ent, whether they have not heard intelligibly the &s;ound of the Trum|pet, calling them with a degree of certainty, to ari&s;e and prepare them&s;elves for the Battle. My Brethren and Si&s;ters, among&s;t whom I have been con&s;train'd in the overflowings of the Fathers Love, to labour in a private capacity, breaking (I hope I may &s;ay) a little bread from hou&s;e to hou&s;e&mdash;the everla&s;ting Go&s;pel has been preach'd among&s;t you with all the force of pathe|tic energy, with all the tenderne&s;s of divine compa&s;&s;i|on; let it not be ineffectual! The Go&s;pel me&s;&s;age has been deliver'd with &s;uch indubitable clearne&s;s, that your judgments have been convinced, you have a&s;&s;ent|ed to "the Truth as it is in Je&s;us;" &s;uffer not the im|pre&s;&s;ions it has made on your minds to be &s;peedily era&s;|ed. Far, very far, be it from me to think highly of my&s;elf, to exalt the Officer, the Mini&s;ter. I would not that you &s;hould hold any Man's per&s;on in high e&s;ti|mation. I am deeply &s;en&s;ible that to me belongs "blu&s;h|ing confu&s;ion of face," but I magnify mine of|fice, and the power of him who has &s;een meet to employ me therein; I would endeavour to exalt in your view the adorable goodne&s;s and conde&s;cen&s;ion of the great Author of all mercies, in that he has cau&s;ed the Trum|pet to be renewedly &s;ounded in your borders; hear its important me&s;&s;age with &s;uitable attention; let it rou&s;e and prepare all the ranks in the Armies of our I&s;rael, to engage in the glorious Cau&s;e of our God. Let the Daughter of our Zion ari&s;e from the bed of Indolence; from the lethargic &s;tupor of a fatal forget|fulne&s;s; from all the deadning benumbing gratifications of &s;en&s;uality, and &s;hake her&s;elf from the du&s;t of the earth, that &s;he may come up to the help of him who hath called her with an high and holy calling. The Trum|pet
<PB N="22" REF="015796_0021_0F9A2BE65186F040">is blown in her &s;treets, the alarm has been heard by all, Oh! let not its language be rendered unintelligible by the multiplicity of trivial things that too much ab|&s;orb the minds of many.</P>
<P>I am fully per&s;uaded that the gracious Vi&s;itation of humbling melting goodne&s;s, has been afre&s;h extended to individuals pre&s;ent, in (I had almo&s;t &s;aid) a very me|morable manner; nor will I recall the expre&s;&s;ion, for if it is not trea&s;ured up in your remembrance now, for your pro&s;it and advantage, it will be memorable in that awful approaching period, when every neglected mercy will appear deeply engraven, as a dread <Q>Hand|writing on the wall,</Q> again&s;t us. Let me therefore tenderly intreat you, with all the warmth of unutterable affection, as a Brother, as a fellow Pilgrim, through the vici&s;&s;itudes of time to the unmix'd Joys of a happy eternity, that you will no longer neglect the offers of Mercy, or turn a deaf ear to the reproofs of In&s;truction. I feel my mind covered with that boundle&s;s Love, that wi&s;hes, that ardently de&s;ires, you may indeed be wi&s;e for your&s;elves: For although I may be deficient in ma|ny qualifications of a Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter, I am not want|ing in that pure di&s;intere&s;ted Love, which &s;eeks not yours but you. <Q>Blow the trumpet in Zion; &s;anctify a Fa&s;t.</Q> If we were but enough attentive to the &s;ound of the Trumpet, we &s;hould &s;ee the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of this &s;anctified fa&s;t; a fa&s;t from every of tho&s;e delu&s;ive plea&s;ures, tho&s;e &s;lavi&s;h attatchments, that render the mind in&s;en&s;ible of Good. <Q>Call a &s;olemn A&s;&s;embly.</Q> This branch of the &s;ummons (may &s;ome &s;ay) belongs only to a few, and we have no &s;hare in the duty it enjoins. I confe&s;s I am of another opinion: I think every Individual has a &s;hare in the In&s;truction couch'd in it. "Call a &s;olemn A&s;&s;embly." Oh! you active ones, &s;top a while in your &s;wift carreer; make a &s;olemn pau&s;e; &s;tand collected from every object that

I believe there is no u&s;ele&s;s, dead, unactive member in the Church of God; and tho&s;e that can thus a&s;&s;emble the collected attention of a redeemed mind, devoted to do the divine will, have an undoubted right from the highe&s;t Authority to call an holy convocation. <Q>We can do nothing again&s;t the Truth but for the Truth,</Q> was the language of &s;ome formerly, who had indeed &s;anctified an acceptable Fa&s;t. I much de&s;ire that tho&s;e who perhaps cannot be &s;o active in promoting this glo|rious Cau&s;e among&s;t the Sons of Men, as &s;ome who are called into more eminent &s;tations in the Church, may by a circum&s;pect care over all their words and actions, &s;ee that they do nothing again&s;t the Truth. "Call a &s;olemn a&s;&s;embly; gather the People." How &s;catter'd are many of the members of this Quarter! &s;catter'd indeed as &s;heep without a &s;hepherd! di&s;per&s;ed up and down in the dark vale of in&s;en&s;ibility and &s;elf-forgetfulne&s;s! many upon the barren Mountains of an empty profe&s;&s;ion; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to all &s;en&s;e of religious fellow|&s;hip; unacquainted with that holy union in which is the bond of Peace! How many are the Gallios I have met with among&s;t you, who (a as! it may be &s;aid) care for none of the&s;e things! Oh you Elders! who are or might have been as Pillars in the Lords Hou&s;e; you delegated Shepherds, who might have adorned the fir&s;t ranks in the armies of our I&s;rael, if you had not &s;at down and taken up a re&s;t &s;hort of tho&s;e glorious abodes, which are prepared for them that &s;teadily per&s;evere in the line of divine appointment&mdash;to you the call is, "Gather the People."</P>
<P>"Am I my Brothers keeper!" let it &s;uffice for me that I look to my&s;elf, and that my own Family is in tolerable order, is a language that too much prevails.
<PB N="24" REF="015796_0023_0F9A2BE7D18D3D88">But Oh! that you had the Cau&s;e of God more at heart that you were more engaged to gather the People that you might with a Fatherly care overlook tho&s;e who&s;e minds at pre&s;ent re&s;emble the barren de&s;ert, the uncultivated wilderne&s;s; that you might comfort and encourage them that tread the gloomy &s;cenes of an adver&s;e allotment, as it were cut off from every Joy, and alive to each painful &s;en&s;ibility; how would it com|fort many of the&s;e, if an experienced friend was now and then to drop into their families, and at times &s;peak a word, in the opening of divine wi&s;dom, &s;uit|able to their &s;everal &s;tates: I believe it would be a great means of gathering the People. Why &s;hould your care be circum&s;cribed within the narrow limits of your own Families (altho' they &s;hould certainly be well regulated) but you might be more exten&s;ively &s;ervicea|ble, if thus engaged in the care of the Hou&s;hold of God. I am per&s;uaded that the divine wing would be over you, and a Ble&s;&s;ing would attend your labours. 'Tis not a time for us to dwell unconcerned in our ceiled Hou&s;es, when the Hou&s;e of God lies wa&s;te.

<P>"Sanctify the Congregation; a&s;&s;emble the Elders." I have been deeply concern'd to &s;ee &s;ome of the Elders &s;o deficient in filling the line of divine appointment. If they were more frequently engaged to a&s;&s;emble un|der the holy influence of that power in which they &s;hould move, they would many of them be command|ed to "blow the Trumpet in Zion;" but I know of no &s;tate harder to &s;peak to or more difficult to reach, than that of an Elder who&s;e mind is overgrown by the earthly nature; <Q>Oh!

<P>"Gather the Children." You that have the ri&s;ing Youth under your care, let me call upon you, let me intreat you to "gather the Children;" gather them from all the bewitching enticing allurements of the world, gather their attention to that of God in their own minds.
