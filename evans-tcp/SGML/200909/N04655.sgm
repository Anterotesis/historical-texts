<P>_WHAT is here attempted, is a &s;hort Sy&s;tem of <HI>Ethics</HI> or <HI>Morality,</HI> which has been of late called the <HI>Religion of Nature:</HI> by which, I would not be under&s;tood to mean a Sy&s;tem of Truths and Duties which meer <HI>Natural Rea&s;on</HI> would ever, of it &s;elf, have clearly di&s;covered, in the pre&s;ent Condition of Mankind, without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>divine Revelation:</HI> for, as I do not believe the human Kind ever were, not even in their original State of Innoceny, without revealed Religion; &s;o neither do I believe they would ever &s;ince have fully di&s;covered all the&s;e Principles of Truth and Duty, by their meer Rea&s;on without the Help of Revelation.&mdash;But what I mean, is, that Sy&s;|tem of Truths and Duties, which, though they are not all of them, obvious to our weak Rea&s;on, without Revelation; yet, when di&s;|covered either by the one or the other, do evidently appear, upon due Con&s;ideration, to be founded in the fir&s;t Principles of Rea&s;on and Nature, and from thence to be capable even of &s;trict Demon&s;tration.</P>
<P><PB REF="005794_0004_1026EF8C0D4DA7A8">
We know there are a great Number of Truths in <HI>Mathematics</HI> and <HI>natural Philo&s;ophy,</HI> which not one in ten Thou&s;and of the Bulk of Mankind would ever have thought of, had it not been for &s;uch great Men as <HI>Euclid, Apolo|nius, Archimedes,</HI> and Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> &amp;c. which, yet may be &s;afely received upon their Authority, and practi&s;ed upon by tho&s;e who have not Lei&s;ure or Ability to attend to the Rea&s;ons of them: But now they have led the Way, it is not very difficult to tho&s;e who are capable of thinking, to enter into the Demon&s;trations of them.&mdash; The Ca&s;e is much the &s;ame as to moral Truths and Du|ties, with regard to the Authority of Prophets and Lawgivers.&mdash;It is the Part of the <HI>Phrophet</HI> or <HI>Lawgiver,</HI> as &s;uch, to di&s;cover Truths and enjoin Laws as Rules of Behaviour to the People, who are to receive them upon their Authority:&mdash; And it is the Part of the <HI>Phi|lo&s;opher,</HI> as &s;uch, to enter into the Rea&s;ons and Demon&s;trations on which tho&s;e Truths and Duties are orginally founded. &mdash;</P>
<P>Such a &s;hort Delineation of <HI>Morality</HI> may, perhaps, be of &s;ome U&s;e, e&s;pecially in the&s;e Times, wherein there is a Sect ari&s;en, or rather revived, that us continually decrying <HI>Morality,</HI>

<HEAD>ETHICS, OR Moral Philo&s;ophy.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. MORAL PHILOSOPHY is the Knowledge of the <HI>Moral World,</HI> or the World of intelli|gent free Agents, with a Conduct and Beha|viour &s;uitable thereunto, in the Pur&s;uit of true Happine&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. By the World of intelligent free Agents, is indeed meant the whole Sy&s;tem of created Spirits, both Angels and Men, con&s;idered as being derived from, and under the Con|duct and Government of Almighty GOD: &mdash; But what I mean chiefly to in&s;i&s;t upon, is the <HI>Knowledge of our &s;elves,</HI> as we are Men, or a moral Sy&s;tem of rational Animals, in all the Relations wherein we &s;tand, both with Regard to GOD, our &s;elves, and one another, with a Behaviour &s;uitable thereunto; (without con&s;idering us either in our <HI>ceconomical</HI> or <HI>political</HI> Capacities,) being that Part of <HI>Moral Philo&s;ophy,</HI> which is the Foundation of all the re&s;t, and is u&s;ually termed, <HI>Ethics.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>ETHICS</HI> is the Art of living happily by the right Knowledge of our &s;elves and the Practice of Virtue: &mdash;
<PB N="10" REF="005794_0008_1026EF96609FF978">our Happine&s;s being the End, and Knowledge and Vir|tue the Means to that End.&mdash;</P>
<P N="4">4. We are &s;aid to live happily when we enjoy our &s;elves and all that is really good for us in the whole of our Nature and Duration; i. e. con&s;idered as rea&s;onable, active and immortal Creatures: &mdash; for Happine&s;s means, that Plea&s;ure which ari&s;es in us from our Enjoyment of our &s;elves and all that is really good for us, or &s;uitable to our Nature in the whole.&mdash;</P>
<P N="5">5. The Enjoyment of our &s;elves and all that is truly good, depends upon a good Habit or State of the Soul united with, and delighting in its proper Objects:&mdash; And this good Habit is the &s;ame Thing with <HI>Virtue.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Virtue</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in that Integrity, Firmne&s;s and Stability of the Soul, whereby we do hone&s;tly and &s;tedfa&s;tly per&s;i&s;t, in Spite of all Temptations to the contrary, in the Love and Practice of <HI>Moral Good,</HI> and the Hatred and Forbear|ance of <HI>Moral Evil.&mdash;Vice</HI> is the contrary.</P>
<P N="7"><HI>Moral Good</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in freely choo&s;ing and doing what|&s;oever Truth and right Rea&s;on dictate as nece&s;&s;ary to be cho&s;en and done in order to our true Happine&s;s.&mdash;<HI>Moral Evil</HI> the contrary.</P>
<P N="8">8. There are two Things nece&s;&s;ary to be con&s;idered with Re&s;pect to the Nature of Moral Good, viz. The <HI>Criterion</HI> or Te&s;t by which in the right U&s;e of our Rea&s;on, we determine what we ought to do or forbear; and the Obligations we thereupon find our &s;elves under to the Practice of it.</P>
<P N="9">9. (1) The <HI>Criterion</HI> or Te&s;t whereby to determine what we ought to do or forbear, or which tho&s;e Actions and For|bearances are, which are to be cho&s;en and done, is the <HI>Na|tural Good</HI> of them, or that Plea&s;ure and Happine&s;s in the whole of our Nature and Duration, which naturally attends them.&mdash;For we find by Experience that &s;ome Things, Affecti|ons and Actions are in the very Nature of them nece&s;&s;arily
<PB N="11" REF="005794_0009_1026EF9805E677B0">attended with Plea&s;ure or Happine&s;s, and others with Pain or Mi&s;ery: And as Plea&s;ure or Happine&s;s is what we call <HI>Natural Good;</HI> &s;o Pain or Mi&s;ery we call <HI>Natural Evil.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P N="10">10. I &s;ay, <HI>in the whole of our Nature and Duration,</HI> as we are both <HI>Sen&s;itive</HI> and <HI>Rational,</HI> and <HI>Social</HI> and <HI>Immortal</HI> Creatures: &mdash;It mu&s;t therefore be the Good and Happine&s;s of the <HI>whole human Nature,</HI> and the <HI>whole moral Sy&s;tem,</HI> in <HI>Time</HI> and to all <HI>Eternity:</HI>&mdash; Hence, the <HI>Good</HI> of the <HI>Body,</HI> or the Plea&s;ure of Sen&s;e cea&s;es to be good, and hath the Nature of <HI>Evil,</HI> when it is incon&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>Good</HI> and Happine&s;s of the <HI>Soul:</HI>&mdash; Which is al&s;o the Ca&s;e of <HI>private Good,</HI> &s;o far forth as is it incon&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>Good</HI> of the <HI>Publick:</HI> And <HI>temporal Good,</HI> &s;o far forth as it is incon&s;i&s;tent with that which is <HI>eternal.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. And this our <HI>Good</HI> or Happine&s;s in the whole, does nece&s;&s;arily coincide with, and even re&s;ult from the <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Nature</HI> of Things, or Things, Affections and Actions con|&s;idered as being what they really are; for thus to con&s;ider them, is the &s;ame Thing with con&s;idering them as being <HI>fitted</HI> and tending or not tending in the <HI>Nature</HI> of them to render our rational, &s;ocial and immortal Nature int he whole ultimately happy.&mdash;So that the <HI>general Good</HI> of <HI>the whole,</HI> the <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Fitne&s;s of Things,</HI> and the <HI>Truth of Things,</HI> or Things con&s;idered as being what they are, are really coin|cident, and do in Effect come to the &s;ame Thing in &s;ettling the <HI>Criterion</HI> of Right and Wrong, or the Te&s;t whereby we mu&s;t determine what we are to chu&s;e or avoid, and to do or forbear.</P>
<P N="12">12. <HI>Moral Good,</HI> therefore, mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in freely chu&s;ing and acting conformable to the <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Nature</HI> of <HI>Things;</HI> or to Things, Affections and Actions con&s;idered as being what they really are, i. e. as tending or not tending to our true Happine&s;s:&mdash; Or,(which is the &s;ame Thing,) in chu&s;ing and acting according to the <HI>Fitne&s;s of Things,</HI> or to Things, Affections and Actions, con&s;idered as fitted in their own Nature to promote our be&s;t <HI>Good</HI> and Happi|ne&s;s <HI>in the whole.</HI></P>
<P N="13"><PB N="12" REF="005794_0010_1026EF9A5B6DED48">
13. And this again is the &s;ame Thing with chu&s;ing and acting according to <HI>right Rea&s;on,</HI> it being by the right U&s;e of our <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> that we apprehend Things as being what they really are, and di&s;cover which tho&s;e Things, Affections and Actions are, that do in the Nature of them tend to our true Happine&s;s in the whole, and thereby judge what we mu&s;t do and avoid, and form Rules by which we mu&s;t act in all our Conduct and Behaviour in order that we may be truly happy.</P>
<P N="14">14. (II.) The <HI>Obligation</HI> we are under, or that which binds or engages us as moral Agents (i. e. as intelligent con|&s;cious de&s;igning free Agents) to do, what according to the Truth, Nature and Fitne&s;s of Things tends to our Happine&s;s in the whole, and to forbear the contrary, is twofold, <HI>Natural</HI> and <HI>Internal,</HI> or <HI>External</HI> and <HI>Moral.</HI></P>
<P N="15">15. (1.) The <HI>Natural</HI> and <HI>Internal Obligation</HI> we are un|der to tho&s;e Actions and Forbearances ari&s;es from that great <HI>Law of our Nature,</HI> (which may be called the Law of <HI>Self-Love</HI> or <HI>Self-E&s;teem,</HI> and which ari&s;es from the Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of our Exi&s;tence and of Plea&s;ure or Pain) whereby we are, by the Author of our Being, laid under a Nece&s;&s;ity of va|luing our &s;elves and our own <HI>Intere&s;t,</HI> and of &s;eeking and pur|&s;uing our own <HI>Pre&s;ervation</HI> and <HI>Well-being</HI> or Happine&s;s, and whatever we find tends to it or is connected with it; and con&s;equently, that of the Society to which we belong, with which we find our own is, in the Nature of Things, nece&s;|&s;arily connected.&mdash;This Principle makes us mutually de|&s;irous of each other's E&s;teem and Good-Will, and puts us upon doing what we know may be plea&s;ing and advanta|geous to each other, &s;o that &s;elf and &s;ocial Good mu&s;t not be con&s;idered as at all interfering, but as being intirely coin|cident, and &s;ub&s;ervient to each other.</P>
<P N="16">16. But while we re&s;t here and act upon no other Views or Motives than what this <HI>Law of our Nature</HI> &s;ug|ge&s;ts, though what we do may be &s;aid, according to the common Acceptation, to be meerly <HI>morally good</HI> or evil, and virtuous or vicious; yet there will be nothing in it,
<PB N="13" REF="005794_0011_1026EF9D7283BB70">(however firm and &s;table our Conduct be) that can properly be called <HI>Religion,</HI> which mu&s;t ever enter into the ju&s;t and complete Notion of <HI>Morality;</HI> for this mu&s;t be under&s;tood to comprehend every Thing that can either direct or influ|ence our moral Behaviour, and con&s;equently mu&s;t con&s;ider us in all the Relations wherein we &s;tand, and above all, our Relation to the great Author of our Being.</P>
<P N="17">17. (2.) The <HI>external</HI> and <HI>moral Obligation</HI> we are under to tho&s;e Actions and Forbearances above-mentioned ari&s;es from <HI>moral Government,</HI> or the Con&s;ideration that they are the Will and Law of a Superior who aims at our Hap|pine&s;s in the enjoining of them, to whom we are account|able for our Actions, and by whom we &s;hall be rewarded or puni&s;hed, i. e. made to feel Plea&s;ure or Pain, according as we behave well or ill: So that this Obligation takes it's Force from the former.&mdash; And this is twofold, <HI>political</HI> and <HI>religious.</HI></P>
<P N="18">18. (1.) The <HI>political Obligation</HI> is the Con&s;ideration that they are the public Will, or the Will and <HI>Law of the So|ciety</HI> or Government that we live under (whether indeed it be a Family or a State,) inforced by the Sanctions of tem|poral Rewards and Puni&s;hments. &mdash; In this View <HI>moral Laws,</HI> become <HI>political Laws,</HI> and <HI>moral Good, political Good.</HI></P>
<P N="19">19. But here again, while we re&s;t on this Foot, and act only under the&s;e political Views, with Regard meerly to this World; though we may be &s;aid to be meer <HI>moral Men,</HI> (as that Expre&s;&s;ion is commonly u&s;ed) or <HI>good Com|mon-Wealth&s;men,</HI> we cannot be &s;aid to be <HI>religious,</HI> or what we do to be <HI>Religion;</HI> no not even in tho&s;e Actions that relate to GOD Him&s;elf.&mdash; But,</P>
<P N="20">20. (2.) The <HI>religious Obligation</HI> we are under to tho&s;e Actions and Forbearances which are nece&s;&s;ary to our Hap|pine&s;s in the whole, is the Con&s;ideration that they are the Will and <HI>Law of God</HI> our Creator, Pre&s;erver and &s;upreme moral Governour, the great Author, Head and Lord of
<PB N="14" REF="005794_0012_1026EF9FD0830530">the whole &s;ocial Sy&s;tem, inforced by the Sanctions of <HI>eternal Rewards</HI> and <HI>Puni&s;hments,</HI> to whom we are accountable for all our Behaviour.</P>
<P N="21">21. For it will appear hereafter that they mu&s;t be the Will and Law of God concerning us, becau&s;e he, being per|fectly happy and &s;elf-&s;ufficient, can have no Self-End in giving us Being, and in all his Di&s;pen&s;ations towards us, and that, indeed, he can have no other End than our true Happine&s;s; and that this mu&s;t be his Intere&s;t; his De|light and his greate&s;t Glory, that his rational Creatures be, in the whole, a happy Sy&s;tem.&mdash; And &s;ince it mu&s;t be his Will that we be happy; what&s;oever does, in the Nature of Things, and according to the Con&s;titution which he hath made, tend to our true Happine&s;s, mu&s;t be his <HI>Will</HI> and <HI>Law</HI> concerning us, and con&s;equently our <HI>Duty,</HI> and what is contrary thereunto mu&s;t be Sin.</P>
<P N="22">22. That therefore, which con&s;titutes the Nature of <HI>Reli|gion</HI> and denominates our Actions or Behaviour <HI>religious,</HI> and makes <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Morality,</HI> in the complete Notion of it, coincident, is, That we forbear what&s;oever tends to our Mi|&s;ery, and do every Thing that tends to our Happine&s;s in the whole, in Obedience to the Will of GOD, and from a Sen&s;e of Duty to Him, and in View of his All &s;eeing Eye, and the Account we are to give of our &s;elves to him.</P>
<P N="23">23. So that, upon the whole it appears, That <HI>true Mo|rality,</HI> in the ju&s;t Extent of it, is the &s;ame Thing with the <HI>Religion of Nature,</HI> or that <HI>Religion</HI> which is founded on the <HI>Nature</HI> of Things; and that it may be defined, <HI>The Pur|&s;uit of our true Happine&s;s by thinking, affecting and acting ac|cording to the Laws of Truth and right Rea&s;on, under a Sen&s;e of the Duty that we owe to Almighty GOD, and the Account we mu&s;t expect to give of our &s;elves to him.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Cron&s;az</HI> Art of Thinking. p. 160. Vol. i.</NOTE></P>
<P N="24">4. Since therefore <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Duty</HI> are thus nece&s;&s;arily connected; it mu&s;t be our Bu&s;ine&s;s in this E&s;&s;ay, to &s;earch
<PB N="15" REF="005794_0013_1026EFA16D0A5D70">out all the <HI>Truths</HI> that relate both to our <HI>&s;elves,</HI> to GOD and our <HI>Fellow-Creatures;</HI> and thence to deduce the &s;everal <HI>Duties</HI> that do nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ult from them.</P>
<P N="25">25. Now the&s;e may all be reduced to that grand, ancient Principle of true Wi&s;dom; <HI>Know thy &s;elf,</HI> which mu&s;t im|ply; not meerly the Knowledge of our &s;elves &s;ingly con|&s;idered, but al&s;o in all the Relations wherein we &s;tand; for this is the Knowledge of our &s;elves in the whole; and, becau&s;e we are active as well as intelligent Cratures, and our Happine&s;s depends on Action as well as Thinking, it mu&s;t therefore be under&s;tood to mean a <HI>practical Knowledge.</HI> &mdash; I &s;hall therefore explain this Inquiry under the&s;e <HI>&s;ix</HI> following Heads, which, in Order the better to bring them down into Life and Action, I chu&s;e to expre&s;s in the fir&s;t Per&s;on, or in the Manner of a Conver&s;ation with our &s;elves.</P>
<P N="26">26. Let therefore every one, in Order to the right Know|ledge of him&s;elf and his Duty and Happine&s;s, thus &s;eriou&s;ly reflect and inquire concerning him&s;elf.&mdash; I. <HI>What am I?</HI> &mdash; II. <HI>How came I to be what I am?</HI>&mdash; III. <HI>For what End was I made and have my Being?</HI>&mdash; IV. <HI>What ought I immediately to do and be in Order to an&s;wer the End of my Being?</HI>&mdash; V. <HI>Whether I am what I ought to be?</HI>&mdash; If not, VI. <HI>What ought I to do, as a Means, in Order to be and do what I ought, and in Order finally to an&s;wer the End of my Being?</HI></P>
<P N="27">27. The <HI>three fir&s;t</HI> of the&s;e Inquiries will di&s;cover the <HI>Truths;</HI>&mdash; And the <HI>three la&s;t</HI> the <HI>Duties,</HI> that we are concerned to know and do in Order to our true Happine&s;s: &mdash;And the <HI>Truths</HI> are the <HI>Speculative:</HI>&mdash;And the <HI>Duties</HI> are the <HI>practical</HI> Part of <HI>moral Philo&s;ophy.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of the <HI>Nature of Man,</HI> his <HI>Excellencies</HI> and <HI>Imperfections.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. I. IT is <HI>fir&s;t</HI> nece&s;&s;ary that we di&s;cover the <HI>Truths</HI> con|tained in the <HI>&s;peculative</HI> Part of this Science, relat|ing to <HI>GOD</HI> and our <HI>&s;elves:</HI>&mdash;And, as we take our Ri&s;e to the Knowledge of GOD and his Conduct towards us, from the Knowledge of our &s;elves, we mu&s;t therefore be|gin with this:&mdash; And in Order hereunto, let every one &s;eriou&s;ly a&s;k him&s;elf this Que&s;tion:&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>What am I?</HI> &mdash; And that he may an&s;wer this Inquiry, let him thus con&s;ider and rea&s;on with him&s;elf.&mdash;</P>
<P N="2">2. As I am certain from the Perceptions and Operations of my own Mind that <HI>I am</HI> or have a Being, &s;o I know that I am not a Stock, a Stone or a Tree; for they have mani|fe&s;tly no Sen&s;e or Activity; whereas I am con&s;cious that I can See, Hear, Ta&s;te, Smell, and Feel, and enjoy Plea&s;ure and &s;uffer Pain, and can &s;pontaneou&s;ly exert my &s;elf and act and move from Place to Place, in Pur&s;uance of the one which I love and delight in, and for avoiding the other which I hate and dread: &mdash; all which are much nobler Power and Fa|culties than tho&s;e inanimate Beings are furni&s;hed with.</P>
<P N="3">3. Nor yet am I Bea&s;t, a Hor&s;e, a Dog, or an Ox, &amp;c.&mdash; For tho' they appear to &s;ee, hear, &amp;c. and to feel Plea&s;ure and Pain as I do, and can move them&s;elves &s;pontaneou&s;ly
<PB N="17" REF="005794_0015_1026EFA701BE2EA8">from Place to Place; yet they have but low grovelling Sen&s;ations, Exertions and Enjoyments.&mdash; They appear to have no Notion of any thing but the Objects of Sen&s;e, and to have no Appetite, and to be capable of no Enjoyment of any thing but Meat and Drink and the Means of conti|nuing their Kind, and the&s;e only are the Things to which their Exertions and Activity tend.</P>
<P N="4">4. With Regard to the&s;e, they have, indeed, a wonderful Sagacity, and what looks like De&s;ign and Contrivance; but this does not &s;eem to be their own, becau&s;e they have it originally, and do not acquire it by Teaching, Tryal and In|du&s;try.&mdash; It &s;eems therefore to be what we call an <HI>In&s;tinct,</HI> by which Word, nothing el&s;e can be meant, but that they are rather pa&s;&s;ively acted and conducted by &s;ome other Being; &s;ome Governing Mind on whom they depend, according to certain Laws of Nature which He hath e&s;tabli&s;hed, than that they act from any Principle of Deliberation and De&s;ign with|in them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="5">5. The&s;e Sen&s;ations, Appetites and Exertions indeed I find I have in common with them; but then I am con|&s;cious of va&s;tly noble Powers and Faculties than the&s;e.&mdash; For I find I can reflect and look into my own Mind:&mdash;I can con&s;ider my &s;elf, and my own Powers and Actions and their Objects:&mdash;I can compare one Thing with another. &mdash;I can ab&s;tract and give general Name:&mdash; I can judge of true and fal&s;e, and of right and wrong:&mdash;I can deliberate and weigh Things, and rea&s;on and infer one Thing from another, and reduce them into Method and Order, ac|cording to their various Relations, Connexions, and Depen|dencies: &mdash; I can excite Thoughts and Imaginations of Things pa&s;t or ab&s;ent and recollect them in my Mind at Plea&s;ure, and reject or keep them under my Con&s;ideration, as I plea&s;e, at lea&s;t in a good Mea&s;ure, and am at Liberty to &s;u&s;pend judging till I have carefully examined them, and to act or not to act, in Con&s;equence of my Deliberations as I think fit.&mdash; In the Impre&s;&s;ions of Sen&s;e indeed, I am pa&s;&s;ive, but in all the&s;e I am evidently active, and can chu&s;e or refu&s;e, will or nill, act or not act, from a Prin|ciple
<PB N="18" REF="005794_0016_1026EFA9972AFC08">of Self-Exertion; which are all truly great and noble Powers.</P>
<P N="6">6. I can moreover, in Con&s;equence of the&s;e Abilities, con|trive and project Ends and Means and Rea&s;ons of acting, and Rules to act by, and fore&s;ee much of the Events of my Conduct:&mdash;I can give Laws and propo&s;e Motives to my &s;elf or others, and exact an Account of my &s;elf or them, and give an Account to my &s;elf or others, whether I, or they, do or do not, act according to tho&s;e Laws.&mdash;And I find that as I love or hate Things according as they are a|greeble or di&s;agreeable to me, &s;o I have Hopes or Fears, Joys or Griefs according as I feel, or have in View, Plea|&s;ures or Pains, and am con&s;cious of having done well or ill and can ju&s;tify and applaud, or accu&s;e or condemn my&s;elf or others accordingly.</P>
<P N="7">7. From hence I not only know that I have a Being, but al&s;o, that I have a great Enjoyment of that Being; &mdash; that it is very dear to me,&mdash;and that I am above all Things de&s;irous to pre&s;erve and continue it, and to make it as com|fortable and as happy as ever I can:&mdash; and am therefore concerned to acquire and enjoy all the Means and Accom|modations that are nece&s;&s;ary and convenient for that Pur|po&s;e; which al&s;o I have a great Value for in Proportion to their Sub&s;erviency for that End; and am very apt to be di&s;plea&s;ed at any one that would deprive me of them.&mdash;</P>
<P N="8">8. And as I can look back and remember what I have been knowing to in my Time; &s;o I can imagine a Time when I was not, and conceive a Notion of a great Number of Ages and Tran&s;actions before me, and of an endle&s;s Suc|ce&s;&s;ion of Ages and Tran&s;actions to come: &mdash; And not only conceive that I may, but earne&s;tly de&s;ire, in &s;ome Ca|pacity or other, to bear a Part in them, and to enjoy my &s;elf happily through all imaginable Periods of Duration.&mdash; So that, though I know there was a Time when I began to be; yet I am &s;olicitous that I may never cea&s;e to be, and to enjoy my&s;elf.&mdash; All the&s;e are &s;o many Facts, and I
<PB N="19" REF="005794_0017_1026EFAB37D6B550">am con&s;cious and intuitively certian of them, if I look care|fully within my &s;elf.&mdash; And &s;uch are the Properties of <HI>my Soul</HI> or <HI>Spirit,</HI> which is properly <HI>my &s;elf,</HI> my rea&s;onable and active Nature.</P>
<P N="9">9. But be&s;ides the&s;e Things that relate to my <HI>Soul; (my &s;elf,</HI> or <HI>&s;piritual Nature;</HI>) I find that I have a wonderfully contrived and admirably u&s;eful Engine, <HI>my Body,</HI> which I con&s;tantly carry about me and animate throughout, (being tied and confined to it by the pre&s;ent Laws of my Nature) con&s;i&s;ting of a va&s;t Number and Variety of Parts and Or|gans, exqui&s;itely framed and fitted to each other, and to all the Functions, Powers and Exertions of my Soul.&mdash; My Eyes to &s;ee, my Ears to hear, my Tongue to &s;peak, my Hands to handle, and my Feet to walk, &amp;c. (Not to men|tion a Thou&s;and In&s;tances of the mo&s;t wi&s;e De&s;ign and Con|trivance in all the inward Parts throughout, for all the Pur|po&s;es of the animal Oeconomy, which are not immediately &s;ubject to my own Will and Activity.) Upon the Account of which, as well as the abovementioned Powers of my Soul, I mu&s;t confe&s;s that however I came to be, I am indeed <HI>fear|fully and wonderfully made.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. I al&s;o find, upon looking about me, a va&s;t Variety of &s;en&s;ible Objects;&mdash; a glorious Heaven above me, and a &s;pa|cious Earth beneath me, furni&s;hed with a &s;urprizing Variety of Inhabitants, all connected, (together with my own Body, one of the mo&s;t curious Machines of them all) in a mo&s;t wonderful Manner one with another.&mdash;So that it is mani|fe&s;t from their mutual Dependance and Sub&s;erviency, that they are contrived and de&s;igned to con&s;titute, as in Fact they do, one harmonious beautiful and u&s;eful Sy&s;tem; one complete and intire Whole; in which I find every Thing fitted in the be&s;t Manner, to my own Conveniences and Plea&s;ures, both for the comfortable Sub&s;i&s;tence of my Body, and the Entertaimment and Delight of my Soul; but &s;o that it was at the &s;ame Time the manife&s;t De&s;ign of them to excite, engage, direct and employ my own Activity, with|out which I find I cannot comfortably enjoy either my &s;elf or them.</P>
<P N="11"><PB N="20" REF="005794_0018_1026EFAD8D964198">
11. I can moreover carry my Thoughts and Imaginations throughout the va&s;t Spaces of Heaven and Earth, and have a mighty Curio&s;ity to pry and &s;earch out the Secrets and Laws of Nature, and di&s;cover and conceive of the great Author of it, and what &s;ort of Behaviour and Conduct is &s;uitable to my Nature and the Relation I &s;tand in to Him and my Fellow Creatures, as tending to make me and them happy, and as &s;uch mu&s;t be amiable, and cannot fail of approving it &s;elf not only to my own Rea&s;on and Con&s;cience, but al&s;o to Him and all rea&s;onable Beings, who&s;e E&s;teem and Good-will I am very &s;olicitous to obtain.</P>
<P N="12">12. Of which, as I know there are a great Number of my own Kind, &s;o I cannot rea&s;onably doubt but there are others of various Orders above me, which may have other and noble Sen&s;es than tho&s;e five narrow Inlets that I am ac|quainted with and confined to; and far greater and far greater and nobler Abilities, both of Under&s;tanding and Activity than I am fur|ni&s;hed with. &mdash; Such I can ea&s;ily conceive to be po&s;&s;ible: and from the various Gradations in Perfection of Being in the &s;everal Tribes below me, it is very probable there may be the like Gradations in the &s;everal Tribes of Beings above me.</P>
<P N="13">13. As to tho&s;e of my own Species, (from which I may form &s;ome Judgment of them) I find we were evidently made for Society, being furni&s;hed with the Power of Speech as well as Rea&s;on, whereby we are rendered capable of en|tering into the Under&s;tanding of each other's Minds and Sentiments, and holding mutual Intercour&s;e and Commerce one with another, and jointly con&s;piring to promote our common Well-Being; to which we are naturally led by a Principle of Benevolence and &s;ocial Di&s;po&s;itions and Affecti|ons, and by the nece&s;&s;ary Condition of our Nature, which not only places us in the various Relations of Hu&s;bands and Wives, Parents and Children, &amp;c. but al&s;o lays us un|der a Nece&s;&s;ity of mutual Dependance one upon another, which obliges us to enter into mutual Compacts for our Defence and Safety, and for maintaining both private Right and public Order, and promoting the common Good of
<PB N="21" REF="005794_0019_1026EFB004AE16F0">our Species, in the &s;everal Communities to which we be|long&mdash; In a Word; as I cannot long enjoy my &s;elf in a State of Solitude, and have a &s;trong Pa&s;&s;ion for Society; &s;o I find in Fact that my true Intere&s;t and Enjoyment of my &s;elf depends on the general Intere&s;t and good Order of the Community. &mdash;Such are my Abilities and Advantages; and &s;uch my Condition and Circum&s;tances and tho&s;e of the Kind to which I &s;tand related.</P>
<P N="14">14. But then, if I con&s;ider my &s;elf a little further, I find after all, that at be&s;t, I am attended with very great Limi|tations and Imperfections.&mdash;I cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t my &s;elf a Mo|ment, nor add one Power or Faculty to tho&s;e I have: And there are certain Bounds, (&s;mall compared with what I can ea&s;ily imagine) beyond which I cannot at all extend or exert them.&mdash; My Sight and Hearing are very &s;canty; my Un|der&s;tanding is but &s;mall; my Conceptions are very feeble; my Memory is very brittle; my Attention is very weak; my Knowledge is very confu&s;ed; my Will is very irre&s;olute, my Power is very infirm, and my Activity can extend to but a very &s;mall Compa&s;s.</P>
<P N="15">15. But, which is wor&s;e; I find I am troubled with &s;un|dry Tendencies in the Frame of My Nature; &s;ome idle, &s;en&s;ual Di&s;po&s;ition or other; &s;ome impetuous Appetite, or &s;ome untoward Pa&s;&s;ion, which I find it very difficult to com|mand, or keep within rea&s;onable Bounds, and in Indulgence to which, it is much if I have not contracted &s;ome ill Ha|bit or other, or at lea&s;t been guilty of many grievous Mi&s;|carriages, for which my own Rea&s;on and Con&s;cience have &s;adly reproached me, and given me very great Unea&s;ine&s;s, and &s;ometimes terrible Apprehen&s;ions and Forebodings of Vengeance to come, unle&s;s I repent and reform.&mdash; And by comparing my &s;elf with others, I find this is what, in Fact, every one finds in &s;ome Degree or other to be the Ca&s;e with him&s;elf, and Multitudes I o&s;erve are much under the Dominion of the&s;e perver&s;e Di&s;po&s;itions: Hence the &s;ad Complaints of the Prevalence of Lu&s;t, Pa&s;&s;ion, Preju|dice, Price and Deceit, much obtaining in the World, cor|rupting and bia&s;&s;ing the Minds, perverting the Judgments
<PB N="22" REF="005794_0020_1026EFB353FBBCE8">and Re&s;olutions of Mankind, and leading them into many Errors and Vices in Practice, to the great Mi&s;chief and Con|fu&s;ion of Society.</P>
<P N="16">16. At the &s;ame Time I find by &s;ad Experience, that I amd daily liable to many Infirmities and Di&s;ea&s;es, Pains and Mi&s;eries, Lo&s;&s;es and Di&s;appointmets, and perpetual Un|certainty, with Re&s;pect to my Life and Health, and every Thing about me, and mu&s;t expect, in a little Time, to quit my pre&s;ent State of Being, and re&s;ign to the common Fate of a Di&s;&s;olution, which is called <HI>Death</HI> that gha&s;tly King of Terrors, who is ince&s;&s;antly making his Approaches towards me in one Shape or other.&mdash; Such a &s;trange Mixture is hu|man Nature!&mdash; Such an unhappy Creature is Man! Such his noble Abilities and Excellencies on the one Hand; and &s;uch his great Imperfections and Wretchedne&s;s on the other!&mdash;</P>

<P N="1">1. II. I Proceed now to the next Inquiry: Let every one then, in the <HI>&s;econd</HI> Place, &s;eriou&s;ly a&s;k him&s;elf this Qua&s;tion, <HI>How came I to be, and to be &s;uch a poor imperfect and &s;inful Being as I am?</HI>&mdash;For we cannot have a right Knowledge of our &s;elves without con&s;idering, not only what we are in our &s;elves, but al&s;o how we &s;tand vari|ou&s;ly related, and particularly, without looking to the Cau&s;e of our pre&s;ent Being and Limitations.&mdash; And in An&s;wer to this Que&s;tion, Let us con&s;ider and rea&s;on with our &s;elves in the following Manner.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="23" REF="005794_0021_1026EFB4F185FA80">
2. I know that I am made, becau&s;e I have a Being and did begin to be.&mdash; It is certain that I could not come into Being by meer <HI>Chance;</HI> for that is nothing but an emp|ty Name, which we u&s;e only to cover our Ignorance or Inadvertence:&mdash; And it is no le&s;s certain that I did not make my&s;elf, for that would imply, to be and not to be at the &s;ame Time: Nor have I Power to continue my &s;elf in Being &s;o much as one Moment; nor can I a Moment &s;ecure my Health, or any of my Enjoyments:&mdash; So that I find I am wholly a limited and dependent Being.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is therefore certain, that I mu&s;t have had a Cau&s;e: for an Effect without a Cau&s;e can have no Meaning: there mu&s;t then be &s;ome other Being on whom I depend.&mdash;And &s;ince there cannot be an Effect without a Cau&s;e, it is evident that the Cau&s;e of my Being mu&s;t have Powers capable of producing &s;uch an Effect: otherwi&s;e there would &s;till be an effect without a Cau&s;e, than which nothing can be more ab&s;urd.&mdash; It is evident that my Parents could not be the adequate Cau&s;es; they could, at mo&s;t be only the Occa&s;ions of my Being: for it never was in their Power, that I &s;hould be at all, or being that I &s;hould be &s;uch as I am; nor could they continue me a Moment in Being, Health or Ea&s;e.&mdash; It is therefore plain that I mu&s;t look higher for an adequate Cau&s;e, both of my Exi&s;tence and Sub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is moreover manife&s;t that no Cau&s;e can give what it has not, or, which is the &s;ame Thing, produce an Effect more noble than it &s;elf; for then again, there would be an Effect without a Cau&s;e, or &s;omething produced by no|thing, which is impo&s;&s;ible.&mdash; So that what is de&s;titute of Perception, Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s and Intelligence, cannot produce a perceptive, con&s;cious, intelligent Being: What has no Principle of Deliberation, Liberty and Activity cannot pro|duce a con&s;iderate, free, active Being, &amp;c. It is therefore evident that the Being who brought me into Being, mu&s;t him&s;elf be po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of Powers analogous to tho&s;e I experience in my &s;elf.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="24" REF="005794_0022_1026EFB7501DD6D8">
5. Since, therefore, I know I have &s;ome con&s;iderable Degrees of Under&s;tanding, Knowledge, Will, Force and Activity, with Freedom of Deliberation, Choice and De&s;ign, and the Powers of Self-Exertion and Self-Determination, together with &s;ome Sen&s;e of Benevolence, of right and wrong, and of Equity and Iniquity, and &s;ome Di&s;po&s;ition to do the one, and avoid the other: It is from hence evident that the Almighty Being who made me, whom I call GOD, being the glorious Cau&s;e on whom I depend, mu&s;t Him&s;elf have <HI>Under&s;tanding, Know|ledge, Will, Force</HI> and <HI>Activity;</HI> mu&s;t have <HI>Liberty, Choice, Deliberation</HI> and <HI>Self-Exertion;</HI> and mu&s;t be a Being of <HI>Equity, Ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>Goodne&s;s,</HI> and all other moral Perfections which are implied in the&s;e, and comprehended under the Term <HI>Holine&s;s.</HI>&mdash; And as I am thus truly made by him, and in &s;ome Mea&s;ure to re&s;emble him; he mu&s;t therefore be &s;trictly and properly my Parent, or the <HI>Father of my Spirit.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Now what I thus argue from my &s;elf to the Cau&s;e of my Being, mu&s;t be equally true of every other intelligent active Being that knows he had a Beginning of Exi&s;tence, and is limited and dependent, however &s;o perfect, as well as of me.&mdash; From whence it is plain, that this univer&s;al Cau&s;e mu&s;t be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the highe&s;t Powers and Perfections that do any where obtain; and that he mu&s;t hold them intirely independant of any other Being what&s;oever:&mdash; And having all other Beings intirely dependant upon him, it is evident that he cannot be under the Power of any other Being to limit or controul him;&mdash; &s;o that he mu&s;t hold, po&s;&s;e&s;s and enjoy <HI>all po&s;&s;ible Perfection</HI> in and of him&s;elf <HI>without</HI> any po&s;&s;ible <HI>Limitation</HI> or Imperfection.&mdash; And &s;ince all other Beings do thus by the Nece&s;&s;ity of their Nature derive from him and depend on him, he alone mu&s;t be the <HI>nece&s;&s;arily exi&s;tent</HI> Be|ing,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Dr. <HI>Clark</HI>'s and <HI>Burnet's, Boyle</HI>'s Lectures on this Head.</NOTE> and mu&s;t be the univer&s;al <HI>Father of Spirits:</HI> And was accordingly by the wi&s;e&s;t of the ancient Philo&s;ophers &s;tiled, <HI>The Father of the Univer&s;e.</HI></P>
<P N="7"><PB N="25" REF="005794_0023_1026EFBA52852660">
7. In this Method of Rea&s;oning it is evident, that the Cau&s;e of my Being and Powers, and tho&s;e of all other Spirits, or intelligent, active Beings, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be <HI>infinite, eternal,</HI> and <HI>unchangeable.</HI>&mdash; For if he be out of the Power of any other Being to limit or controul him, his Knowledge, Power and Activity cannot be confined to any Point of Space or Duration, nor liable to any Change: So that, as there never was a Time when he could begin to be, &s;o it is impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould ever cea&s;e to be, or ever be altered from what he is: And for the &s;ame Rea&s;on that he can't but be pre&s;ent here or there, or to any particular, a&s;&s;ignable Place or Point of Space, he can't but be every where el&s;e or <HI>omnipre&s;ent.</HI> And hence it is plain, that all Things pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, and to come, in all Parts of the Univer&s;e, mu&s;t at once be pre&s;ent and <HI>perfectly known</HI> to him, and &s;ubject to his Almighty Power; i. e. He mu&s;t be <HI>omni&s;cient</HI> and <HI>omnipotent.</HI> Nor can there be more than <HI>one</HI> &s;uch Being, be|cau&s;e it is thus evident that he alone mu&s;t <HI>nece&s;&s;arily</HI> exi&s;t, and that <HI>all po&s;&s;ible Perfections</HI> are nece&s;&s;arily united in him.</P>
<P N="8">8. What I have thus argued from my own Exi&s;tence. Powers and Faculties, and tho&s;e of every other intelligent, active Creature, may be al&s;o demon&s;trated from the Exi&s;tence of every &s;en&s;ible Thing, that I &s;ee, hear and feel, from without me.&mdash; I know that I am not the Cau&s;e of any of tho&s;e Impre&s;&s;ions that are made on my Sen&s;es; Light, Co|lours, Sounds, tangible Qualities, &amp;c. &mdash; I am &s;ure they do not depend on my Will and Activity, for I am intirely pa&s;|&s;ive in the Reception of them.&mdash;Nor can they be without a Cau&s;e; nor yet from any &s;en&s;le&s;s, inert or unactive Cau&s;e, for that is a Contradiction in Terms. &mdash; They mu&s;t there|fore be the con&s;tant Effects of an intelligent Cau&s;e, intimate|ly pre&s;ent with me, and ince&s;&s;antly active upon me, who con|tinually produces all the&s;e Sen&s;ations in my Mind, corre&s;pon|dent to the Archetypes in his all-comprehending Mind, ac|cording to certain &s;table Laws, or fixed Rules which he hath e&s;tabli&s;hed to him&s;elf, and which are commonly called the Laws of Nature.&mdash; When therefore, I con&s;ider the whole Sy&s;tem of the&s;e &s;en&s;ible Objects that &s;urround me, and under the Impre&s;&s;ion of which I continually live, I mu&s;t conclude
<PB N="26" REF="005794_0024_1026EFBCA61D7628">that I <HI>live and move and have my Being</HI> in him who is the perpetual and invariable Author of them.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">V. Bp. <HI>Berkley</HI>'s Dialogues, P. 78, 79, &amp;c.</NOTE></P>
<P N="9">9. I find the&s;e &s;en&s;ible Objects are all firmly connected toge|ther; Things vi&s;ible with Things tangible, and all the various Combinations of them, one with another, &s;o as to con&s;titute one mo&s;t beautiful and u&s;eful Whole, which we call the <HI>Natural World;</HI> in all which, I do manife&s;tly &s;ee the mo&s;t wi&s;e De&s;ign and the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Contrivance; from whence I gather that they mu&s;t be the Effect of a mo&s;t wi&s;e and de&s;igning Cau&s;e. &mdash; And I do evidently experience that they are all contrived in the be&s;t Manner to render them &s;ub&s;er|vient to all the Purpo&s;es of my Sub&s;i&s;tence and Well-being, and that of the whole rational and moral Sy&s;tem which we call the <HI>moral World;</HI> from whence I mu&s;t conclude the glorious Cau&s;e of them to be, not only an infinitely <HI>wi&s;e</HI> and <HI>powerful,</HI> but moreover an infinitely <HI>kind</HI> and <HI>benevolent Being.</HI></P>

I do not, indeed, find upon a clo&s;e Examination of them, that there is any nece&s;&s;ary Connexion between them; for In&s;tance, between what I &s;ee or hear, and what I feel: The one appears to be only and meerly the Sign, and not the Cau&s;e of the other, being all alike meer pa&s;&s;ive Perceptions in our Minds; &s;o that the Connexion between them, tho' &s;table, is intirely arbitrary; as arbitrary as that between the Sound <HI>Man</HI> and the Thing &s;ignified by it: From whence I gather, that I mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily con&s;ider the one with regard to the other, to have the Nature of a wonderful Language,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Minute Philo&s;opher, Dial. 4.</NOTE> whereby the great Author of Nature is continually pre&s;ent with me; and di&s;co|covering him&s;elf and his Mind and Will to me; (and that in a &s;table and invariable Manner, which I can always depend upon;) and as it were &s;peaking to me, and directing me how to act and conduct my &s;elf in the Affairs of Life; and thereby di&s;playing, not only his infinite <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>Power,</HI> but al&s;o his marvellous <HI>Goodne&s;s</HI> before me, and making me a continual Partaker of it.&mdash;From whence it is evident, that he mu&s;t be, not only a Being of infinite
<PB N="27" REF="005794_0025_1026EFBE48C68560">Wi&s;dom, Power and Goodne&s;s, but at the &s;ame time a Being of the mo&s;t &s;table Truth and invariable Integrity.</P>
<P N="11">11. I do moreover &s;ee and feel a va&s;t Variety of Motions, on the Laws of which, mo&s;t wi&s;ely contrived, depends the whole Order, Harmony and U&s;efulne&s;s of the natural World. &mdash; But it is certain that nothing which is Corporeal can move it &s;elf, being meerly pa&s;&s;ive and inert: and yet it is no le&s;s evi|dent that Motion implies Force and Activity in the Mover:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mens agitat molem. <HI>Virg.</HI></NOTE> and this implies the Power and Pre&s;ence of an Agent, &s;ince nothing can act where it is not: &mdash; from whence it manife&s;tly follows, that in all the wi&s;ely contrived Motions of Nature, as well as all other Objects of Sen&s;e, both in the Heavens above, and in the Earth below, we con&s;tantly &s;ee and feel the univer&s;al Pre&s;ence of that mo&s;t wi&s;ely de&s;igning and mo&s;t powerfully active, all-comprehending Mind who both begins and continues Motion, and is the glorious Father and Author of all Things.</P>
<P N="12">12. Furthermore, as I ob&s;erve all the&s;e &s;en&s;ible Objects about me are connected together in a wonderful Manner, into one mo&s;t beautiful and u&s;eful Sy&s;tem, and made &s;ub&s;er|vient to my Sub&s;i&s;tence and Well-being and tho&s;e of my Species in this Man&s;ion allotted to us; &s;o I ob&s;erve this <HI>Globe</HI> we live on, to be, no le&s;s wonderfully connected with the <HI>Sun,</HI> and the other <HI>Planets,</HI> with us &s;urrounding and depend|ing upon him, &s;o that they all make one intire Sy&s;tem; the other Globes being probably de&s;igned for U&s;es analo|gous to this of ours.&mdash; And as the prodigious Number of <HI>Fixed Stars</HI> &s;eem to be of the &s;ame Nature, &s;o it is probable, they are de&s;igned for the like Purpo&s;es with tho&s;e for which I find our <HI>Sun</HI> is manife&s;tly fitted and de&s;igned, and may con|&s;equently have Globes like our's depending upon them. &mdash; If &s;o; as this gives me a &s;tupendous Idea of the va&s;t Extent and Variety of the mighty Works of God; &s;o it mu&s;t give me an a&s;toni&s;hing Apprehen&s;ion of his excellent <HI>Greatne&s;s, Maje&s;ty</HI> and <HI>Glory,</HI> who is equally pre&s;ent with them all, and does alike di&s;play his infinite <HI>Wi&s;dom, Power</HI> and <HI>Goodne&s;s</HI> in them to all the admiring Beholders; having his whole va&s;t.

<P N="13">13. Now, it being evident from all that has been &s;aid, that this glorious Being whom I call my <HI>GOD,</HI> mu&s;t be a Being of all po&s;&s;ible Perfection; it is plain that he mu&s;t have an intire and ab&s;olute <HI>Sufficiency</HI> in and of him&s;elf to his own Happine&s;s, and therefore cannot need any of his Creatures, or any Thing they can do to make him happy, nor can any Thing they can do make him otherwi&s;e.&mdash; And from his ab&s;olute <HI>Independency,</HI> and their continual and intire Depen|dance upon him, I mu&s;t conclude, that he is not only the <HI>Almighty Creator</HI> and <HI>mo&s;t high Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of Heaven and Earth;</HI> but moreover, that he is the continual <HI>Pre&s;erver</HI> of all his Creatures, and con&s;equently, that the Moment he &s;hould cea&s;e to will the Continuance of their Exi&s;tence, they mu&s;t unavoidably cea&s;e and drop into nothing.</P>
<P N="14">14. Nor can it, I think, be conceived that the infinitely wi&s;e, powerful, ju&s;t and good Author of my Being, and that of all other Beings, would neglect me, and take no further Care of me or them: I cannot imagine but that he mu&s;t look after me, and &s;ee what U&s;e I make of the Being, Pow|ers and Advantages that he hath given me, and take Care to conduct me to the End he de&s;igned in giving them to me, and that in a Manner &s;utable to that Nature which he hath given me.&mdash;It cannot therefore be, but, that he mu&s;t <HI>govern</HI> me as a rea&s;onable and moral Agent, and this by Laws and Motives &s;ugge&s;ted to my Rea&s;on and Con&s;ideration, and to my Hopes and Fears: and that in Con&s;equence of this, he will call me to an Account, and &s;ee how I have conducted my &s;elf in the U&s;e of the Abilities and Talents which he had committed to my Tru&s;t, and whether I have endeavoured to an&s;wer the End of my Being in Conformity to the Laws of that rea&s;onable and &s;elf-active Nature which he hath be|&s;towed upon me, and make me fare well or ill, according as my Behaviour &s;hall be found to have been good or bad. &mdash; That this is fit and rea&s;onable to be expected my own Con&s;cience &s;trongly &s;ugge&s;ts: and that Happine&s;s or Mi&s;ery
<PB N="29" REF="005794_0027_1026EFC279BC3278">will be the Effect of Virtue or Vice, the Nature of the Things them&s;elves loudly proclaims. &mdash; It cannot therefore be but that, as he is my Almighty <HI>Creator</HI> and <HI>Pre&s;erver,</HI> &s;o he mu&s;t be my &s;upreme <HI>King</HI> and <HI>moral Governor.</HI> And what is thus rea&s;onable to think with regard to my &s;elf, mu&s;t be equally true with Re&s;pect to all other Creatures: &mdash; GOD mu&s;t therefore be the univer&s;al <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Lord</HI> of the whole Univer&s;e, which is his <HI>Kingdom,</HI> in which he mo&s;t wi&s;ely and uncontroulably pre&s;ides and orders all Things for the Good of the whole, in a Manner &s;uitable to the be&s;t Intere&s;t of each Nature. I cannot therefore doubt but that he will in the whole and Re&s;ult of Things, bring Good out of Evil and make Evil it &s;elf &s;ub&s;ervient to Good, and even overrule the Sins and Follies of his Creatures &s;o as to an&s;wer the be&s;t Ends.&mdash;</P>
<P N="15">15. If now it be inquired, <HI>How I came to be &s;uch an im|perfect, frail, &s;inful Being as I am?</HI>&mdash; Or how it could be that the GOD that made me, who is him&s;elf the mo&s;t perfect and be&s;t of Beings &s;hould make me &s;uch an imper|fect, &s;inful and mi&s;erable Creature as I find my &s;elf to be? &mdash; To this I mu&s;t an&s;wer in the following Manner. &mdash; That GOD &s;hould make me &s;uch a very imperfect, (or le&s;s perfect) Creature as I am, compared with others, or with what I can ea&s;ily imagine, I &s;ee no Rea&s;on to doubt; ina&s;much as my Being it &s;elf and every Perfection of it and Advantage attending it, mu&s;t be his &s;overeign free Gift, and what he was in no wi&s;e obliged to be&s;tow.&mdash; He is the &s;overeign Lord of his Favours, and mu&s;t therefore be intirely at Liberty to be&s;tow &s;uch Degrees of Being and Perfections, and &s;uch Advantages, greater or le&s;s as he thinks fit: and it appears in Fact, that he hath delighted in a boundle&s;s Variety in all his Works.</P>
<P N="16">16. Indeed that he &s;hould, without any known, voluntary Fault of mine, put me into a Condition that is, in the whole, wor&s;e than not to be, or that he &s;hould, in giving me my Being, lay me under an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of being finally &s;inful and mi&s;erable: This would be very hard indeed; &mdash; But this I mu&s;t think impo&s;&s;ible, as being what I cannot
<PB N="30" REF="005794_0028_1026EFC6351DC740">reconcile with his Attributes above demon&s;trated<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">lle&s;t.</HI> Rel. of Nat. p. 200.</NOTE>&mdash; But &s;o long as I have &s;uch a Being as is de&s;irable, though at|tended with great Frailties, Limitations and Imperfections, and am put into &s;uch a Condition as renders me capable of further Improvements, and of attaining to &s;ome good De|gree of Happine&s;s if I am not wanting to my &s;elf, and &s;ince I &s;hall not be obliged to account for any more than I have received; I cannot rea&s;onably complain, but ought to be thankful for it, though I &s;ee others have much greater Ad|vantages than I, from whom, in all Rea&s;on a proportionably greater Account will be expected.</P>
<P N="17">17. And as to my being &s;o very <HI>&s;inful</HI> a Creature as I confe&s;s I am: &mdash; This I cannot a&s;cribe to GOD: &mdash; For &s;ince the formal Notion of <HI>Sin</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in the known voluntary Oppo&s;ition of our Wills to the Will of GOD, or the Con|&s;titution which he hath made, it mu&s;t be the Fault of my Will and not of his: and accordingly my own Con&s;cience tells me, whenever I do ami&s;s, that I my &s;elf. (and not He) am the Cau&s;e, and true Author of all the Wickedne&s;s I commit. &mdash; If therefore, in&s;tead of being obedient to the Author of my Being, and making a good U&s;e of my Liberty, and of the Powers and Advantages he hath given me, and thereby further improving them; I make a bad U&s;e of them by voluntarily acting contrary to his Will, and thereby &s;ink my &s;elf into a wor&s;e Condition; nay though it were into a wor&s;e Condition than not to be, it is wholly owing to my &s;elf, and not to him that made me.</P>
<P N="18">18. If now I &s;hould a&s;k, Why has God made me at all peccable, or capable of Sin? &mdash; This would be the &s;ame as to a&s;k, Why has he made me capable of Duty? or, Why has he made me a free Agent? &mdash; But this would be a &s;trange Que|&s;tion: for without Liberty, I &s;hould be de&s;titute of one of the chief Excellencies of my rational Nature, and &s;hould not be capable of either Duty or Sin: &mdash; for as Sin con&s;i&s;ts in a free and voluntary Di&s;obedience; &s;o Duty con&s;i&s;ts in a free and willing Obedience to the known Will of God. &mdash; So that without &s;uch a Liberty as would render me capable of Sin,
<PB N="31" REF="005794_0029_1026EFC7D94C6120">there could have been no &s;uch Thing as either Virtue or Vice, Prai&s;e or Blame; nor can either the one or the other obtain, but in Proportion to the Knowledge we have, or may have, of what we ought to do, and the Powers we are furni&s;hed with either to do or forbear.</P>
<P N="19">19. And la&s;tly, As to the many Pains, Calamities, and Mi|&s;eries to which I am liable: &mdash; I mu&s;t think, that as I am a Sinner I need a Cour&s;e of Di&s;cipline; &mdash; That it is fit, natu|ral Evil &s;hould attend moral Evil, as the be&s;t Means for the Cure of it; &mdash; and that therefore God, not only ju&s;tly, but wi&s;ely and kindly inflicts the&s;e Calamities, as being the fitte&s;t Means that could have been u&s;ed to di&s;engage me from tho&s;e Objects that are mo&s;t apt to en&s;nare and mi&s;lead me, and thereby to de&s;troy the Power of Sin, and bring me to Repentance and Reformation: &mdash; and at the &s;ame Time they give me Occa&s;ion and Opportunity for the Exer|ci&s;e of &s;everal Virtues of very great U&s;e towards the perfect|ing of my rea&s;onable and active Nature, which otherwi&s;e could have had no Place; and lead to the Hopes of a better Life hereafter.</P>
<P N="20">20. Thus it appears to me, that without any Imputation either upon the Wi&s;dom, Power, Ju&s;tice or Goodne&s;s of GOD, I can &s;ufficiently account for all the Sin and Mi&s;ery that obtain in the World.&mdash;But if there were &s;ome untoward Appearances in the Conduct of Providence that I could not account for, they ought not to be admitted as any ju&s;t Ob|jections again&s;t what has been antecedently demon&s;trated:&mdash; E&s;pecially &s;ince I am not qualified to be a competent Judge. &mdash; I &s;ee but a &s;mall Part, a &s;hort Scene, of the va&s;t Drama, and therefore cannot make a good Judgment of the whole: &mdash; So that what to me may have the Appearance of Evil, may in the whole have the Nature of Good.&mdash; And it becomes me to have an implicit Faith in the infinite Wi&s;|dom, Power, Ju&s;tice and Goodne&s;s of the Deity above de|mon&s;trated, that it will prove &s;o in the Whole and Re&s;ult of Things.&mdash; And that this Expectation may appear the more rea&s;onable, I proceed now to the next Inquiry.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the <HI>End</HI> of our <HI>Being,</HI> and of our <HI>future State.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. III.

<P N="2">2. That I was not made at all adventures, without any Contrivance and De&s;ign, but mu&s;t have been made for &s;ome End or other, I cannot doubt, &s;ince I have already found that he who gave me my Being, mu&s;t him&s;elf be a Being of all po&s;&s;ible Perfections, and con&s;equently mu&s;t be a mo&s;t kind, wi&s;e and de&s;igning Cau&s;e: E&s;pecially, &s;ince I do al&s;o find in Fact &s;o many, and &s;uch manife&s;t Tokens of the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t benevolent De&s;ign and Contrivance in my whole Frame and every Thing about me.</P>
<P N="3">3. Being therefore made by a mo&s;t wi&s;e, and good Cau&s;e, I mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have been made for &s;ome wi&s;e and good End.&mdash; And having demon&s;trated that the Being who made me has an infinite Sufficiency within him&s;elf for his own Happine&s;s, independant of any other Being, it is manife&s;t, that whatever good End he had in giving me my Being, it could not be to &s;erve him&s;elf of me, or to promote any Ad|vantage to him&s;elf by me.&mdash; This were a Thought infinitely too mean to entertain of him who is <HI>GOD All-&s;ufficient,</HI> that it could be po&s;&s;ible for him to &s;tand in Need of Me, or of any Thing <HI>I</HI> could do or &s;uffer in order to his own Happine&s;s. &mdash;</P>
<P N="4">4. Moreover, &s;ince it has been evidently di&s;covered, that the Author of my Being is infinitely perfect, and con&s;equent|ly
<PB N="33" REF="005794_0031_1026EFCCB050D1F8">perfectly ju&s;t and good; perfectly equitable and benevo|lent; it is hence evident, that he could not give me my Be|ing with any malevolent De&s;ign; much le&s;s with a De&s;ign that I &s;hould be ab&s;olutely and unavoidably mi&s;erable not could he de&s;ign Mi&s;ery, for me in the whole, but in Con&s;i|deration of my per&s;onal, voluntary Demerit, and per&s;i&s;ting in wilful Rebellion again&s;t him;&mdash; for this would be &s;o far from con&s;i&s;ting with Ju&s;tice and Benevolence, that it would be the &s;evere&s;t Cruelty imaginable!&mdash; A Thought which we &s;hould abhor to entertain of the be&s;t of Beings, and remove at an infinite Di&s;tance from him.</P>
<P N="5">5. Indeed in Ca&s;e of wilful Rebellion per&s;i&s;ted in, it is fit and right, and even nece&s;&s;ary for the Good of the whole, (being the mo&s;t effectual Means to &s;ecure the Obedience of his Creatures, which is nece&s;&s;ary for their general Good and Happine&s;s) that Puni&s;hment &s;hould be inflicted upon tho&s;e that rebel, and ob&s;tinately oppo&s;e their Wills to the Con&s;ti|tution he has made, and the Ends of his Government, in Proportion to their &s;everal Crimes and Mi&s;demeanours. &mdash; And indeed Mi&s;chief and Mi&s;ery, does, in the Nature of Things, nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ult from Sin and Vice.&mdash; But it can|not be &s;uppo&s;ed, that their Mi&s;ery could be GOD's primary and ab&s;olute De&s;ign, or that he &s;hould intend their Rebellion, or lay them under a Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;inning, that they might be mi&s;erable;&mdash; for this would, in Effect, be, to will Mi&s;ery for Mi&s;ery's Sake; which to him is infinitely impo&s;&s;ible!</P>
<P N="6">6. On the contrary, &s;ince GOD is evidently a mo&s;t kind and benevolent Being, and could therefore have no other than kind and benevolent Ends in giving Being to his rational Creatures, it is plain that his primary Intention mu&s;t have been &s;o far from that of making them to be mi&s;erable, that he mu&s;t have made them with a De&s;ign that they might be happy in the Participation and Enjoyment of his Goodne&s;s, in Proportion to their &s;everal Capacities.&mdash;Now the Que&s;tion is, what is requi&s;ite to the Happine&s;s of the&s;e Creatures? &mdash; It is plain that they cannot enjoy any Thing el&s;e, unle&s;s they are in a Condition fir&s;t to enjoy them&s;elves: It is no le&s;s plain that they cannot enjoy them&s;elves, unle&s;s they act

<P N="7">7. Since, therefore, GOD has made them to be intelligent, free, active Creatures, their Happine&s;s mu&s;t immediately de|pend upon the right U&s;e of the Powers he has given them: i. e. It mu&s;t depend upon, con&s;i&s;t in the free and vigorous Exertion of their own Under&s;tanding and Activity, in Con|formity to the great Law of their Nature, which is the in|ward Sen&s;e of their own Rea&s;on and Con&s;ciences.&mdash; It mu&s;t therefore have been his De&s;ign that they &s;hould be happy by Means of their own Activity, and by their freely acting rea&s;onably, or conformable to the right Dictates of their own Rea&s;on and Under&s;tanding, and con&s;equently that they &s;hould cultivate and improve their Rea&s;on in the be&s;t Manner they can, under the Circum&s;tances in which he has placed them, in order to make a right Judgment how they ought to act and conduct them&s;elves, to the be&s;t Advantage for their own Happine&s;s.</P>
<P N="8">8.

<P N="7">7. (6.) Since the Peace and Quietne&s;s of Society, which are nece&s;&s;ary to its Happine&s;s, depends not only upon our avoiding every Thing that is injurious, and doing every Thing that is ju&s;t, benevolent and generous; but al&s;o upon every one's being contented in his own Station, and faith|fully endeavouring to di&s;charge the Duties of it, without in|termedling in Affairs that do not belong to his Province; and upon every one's being of a Peace-making and forgiving Spirit; I mu&s;t therefore think it my Duty to keep within my own Sphere, and mind my own Bu&s;ine&s;s, and do the Duty that belongs to my own Station; and if I have done any Wrong, to repair the Injury and make Re&s;titution and a&s;k Forgivene&s;s, as well as to be of a forgiving Spirit towards others, as I would hope GOD to be &s;o towards me; and, in a Word, to do all that I can for pre&s;erving and promoting Friend&s;hip, good Neighbourhood and the public Tranqui|lity. &mdash; The&s;e Duties are called <HI>Quietne&s;s, Peaceablene&s;s, Friendline&s;s</HI> and <HI>Forgivene&s;s,</HI> in Oppo&s;ition to <HI>Ambition, Con|tention, Unfriendline&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Irreconcileablene&s;s.&mdash;</HI></P>

<P N="2">2. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of tho&s;e two la&s;t Inquiries will put us upon the great Duty of <HI>Self-Examination,</HI> which is a Duty of very great Importance to us; for if we do not examine and truly <HI>know our &s;elves,</HI> how &s;hall we be able to rectify what is a|mi&s;s, that we may be in a Capacity of giving a good Ac|count of our &s;elves at la&s;t?&mdash; And as <HI>Seneca</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Illi mors gravis incubat, Qui nimis notus amnibus, Ignotus moritur &s;ibi.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P N="3">3. (1.) Let this then be the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Rule in Order to an&s;wer the Demands of the&s;e la&s;t Que&s;tions, and the fir&s;t Means in Order to become what I ought to be, viz.&mdash;To inure my&s;elf to a Habit of <HI>&s;erious Con&s;ideration;</HI> to &s;u&s;pend acting till I have well weighed the Importance of Things, that I may be under Advantage to make a wi&s;e Choice; and according to <HI>Pythagoras</HI>'s Advice to his Di&s;ciples, to enter frequently into my own Heart, and take a daily and exact Survey of my whole Life;&mdash;to deal faithfully with my &s;elf, and to endea|vour
<PB N="60" REF="005794_0058_1026F00C27BF1068">to think of my Temper and Behaviour as being what it really is, <HI>without Partiality, and without Hypocri&s;y.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. (2.) And as the Knowledge of my &s;elf is of &s;o great Importance, Let it be the next Rule, that I entertain and cul|tivate within my &s;elf a great Sen&s;e of the <HI>Dignity</HI> of my rea|&s;onable and immortal Nature, and a great <HI>Reverence</HI> for it as &s;uch, which would make me always careful to do nothing un|worthy or mi&s;becoming it in all its Relations:&mdash;Let me e&s;pecially have a great Reverence for the Sen&s;e of my own <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> as the Voice of GOD him&s;elf, that I may take Care not to live in any Cour&s;e what&s;oever, for which my own Rea&s;on and Con&s;cience &s;hall reproach me.&mdash;</P>
<P N="5">5. (3.) Since I depend wholly on GOD, and he is ever pre&s;ent with me, a con&s;tant Witne&s;s and Spectator of all my Behaviour, in the inward Temper and Thoughts of my Heart, as well as all the outward Actions of my Life, and that I mu&s;t expect to give an Account of my &s;elf to him; It mu&s;t be my next Rule to endeavour to po&s;&s;e&s;s my &s;elf habitually of a great and <HI>reverend Sen&s;e of GOD,</HI> that I may be careful to do nothing unworthy of his Pre&s;ence and In|&s;pection, and the Relation I &s;tand in to him, and &s;eriou&s;ly en|deavour to guard and di&s;cipline my Thoughts and Affections as well as my Words and Actions in &s;uch a Manner as that they may not be di&s;plea&s;ing to him, but may gain his Favour and Approbation.</P>
<P N="6">6. (4.) If, upon a due Survey of my Temper and Beha|viour, I find I have acted an unrea&s;onable and vicious Part, my own Con&s;cience will not cea&s;e to reproach me for it; &s;o that I cannot fail of feeling a great Deal of Remor&s;e and Unea&s;ine&s;s upon reflecting on my Mi&s;conduct: And if I am &s;orry as I ought to be, I &s;hall hate and abhor it, as being contrary to GOD and all that is right and rea&s;onable, and never be ea&s;y till I reform and return to my Duty and be governed by my Rea&s;on and Con&s;cience, and every wi&s;e and good Con&s;ideration for the Time to come:&mdash;And herein con&s;i&s;ts the Nature of true <HI>Repentance</HI> and <HI>Reformation.</HI></P>

<P N="1">1. THUS I have given a brief Repre&s;entation of the chief Principles of <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Morality,</HI> or a &s;mall Sketch of the great and important Truths and Duties of <HI>Moral Philo&s;ophy,</HI> which is called the <HI>Religion of Nature,</HI> all which appear to me &s;trictly demon&s;trable from the fir&s;t Principles of Rea&s;on, as being founded in the Nature of Things; and have mo&s;t, if not all of them, been in &s;ome Mea&s;ure di&s;covered by Men of Genius in the Heathen World, who were de&s;titute of Revelation, though perhaps &s;omewhat enlightned by ancient Tradition from the Beginning. &mdash; I would, now only add a few Words to &s;hew the <HI>Connection</HI> between them and <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> or <HI>Reveal'd Religion,</HI> which is to be con&s;idered only as a further Means for our In&s;truc|tion, and to beget, improve and perfect in us, all the Vir|tues of an hone&s;t Heart and good Life.</P>
<P N="2">2. For however evident the&s;e Truths and Duties may be to a &s;erious, thinking and con&s;iderate Per&s;on, who has Means of Information, and Lei&s;ure to give a proper Attention to them; yet &s;uch, and &s;o many, are the Cares and Bu&s;i|ne&s;&s;es, and the Plea&s;ures and Amu&s;ements of this Life, which do unavoidably engage the Attention of the general Rate and Bulk of Mankind, that it is hardly to be expected that they &s;hould ever attain to the di&s;tinct practical Knowledge of them in their pre&s;ent Condition, without A&s;&s;i&s;tance from above. &mdash; So that an expre&s;s Revelation is highly expedient, or rather nece&s;&s;ary as a Means to render them, in any tolera|ble Mea&s;ure capable of an&s;wering the End of their Being; e&s;pecially con&s;idering that no Philo&s;opher or Teacher, with|out a &s;ufficiently atte&s;ted Commi&s;&s;ion from GOD, even if he could di&s;cover all the&s;e <HI>Laws of Nature,</HI> could have Au|thority
<PB N="64" REF="005794_0062_1026F0166FA08528">enough to enjoin them as the <HI>Laws of GOD;</HI> and that this would be the mo&s;t direct and compendious Method of an&s;wering this End. &mdash;</P>
<P N="3">3. And, indeed, con&s;idering that the Wi&s;dom, Power and Goodne&s;s of GOD are &s;uch as could not fail to enable and di&s;po&s;e him to do all that was fit and nece&s;&s;ary to conduct the Creatures which he had made (and would not de&s;ert,) to that Happine&s;s which mu&s;t have been the End of their Being; I cannot doubt but that even the fir&s;t Parents of Man|kind, upon their fir&s;t coming into Being and in their State of Innocence, being then perfect Strangers to every Thing, and having every Thing to learn, that related to their Well|being, mu&s;t, in &s;ome Manner or other, have been taught by GOD him&s;elf, many Things relating to Language, Food, the Origin of Things, Philo&s;ophy, Religion &amp;c. (at lea&s;t &s;o much as was nece&s;&s;ary for them to begin with) in order to their Well-being and Happine&s;s. &mdash; And when they had &s;in|ned again&s;t him, and fallen into a State of Mortality and Mi&s;ery, it is natural to conclude, from the &s;ame Goodne&s;s and Compa&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Father of Mercies,</HI> that he would take Pity of them and teach them, (what they could no otherwi&s;e know,) in what Method and upon what Terms they &s;hould be pardoned and re&s;tored to his Favour, and how they &s;hould &s;o conduct for the future as to be accepted with him. &mdash; All this, is, al&s;o, very agreeable to the mo&s;t ancient authentic Account we have of the Origin of Mankind.</P>
<P N="4">4. Accordingly we have abundant Evidence both from Prophe&s;y and Miracles, and undoubted Tradition ever &s;ince; That GOD, (after a Series of introductory In&s;tructions, Revelations and In&s;titutions from the Beginning,) did at length &s;end a glorious Per&s;on, under the Character of <HI>his own Son,</HI> into our Nature, who had had inexpre&s;&s;ible <HI>Glory with him before the World was;</HI> being the <HI>Brightne&s;s of his Glory, and the expre&s;s Image of his Per&s;on,</HI> and by whom he vi&s;ibly di&s;played and exerted his <HI>Almighty Will and Authority</HI> in the Creation and Government of the World, and <HI>in whom dwelt the Fulne&s;s of the Godhead bodily</HI> in his incarnate State. &mdash; This glorious Per&s;on GOD &s;ent among us to act as a
<PB N="65" REF="005794_0063_1026F019AAC0A808">Mediator between him and us. &mdash; For as we are Sinners, it was very fit he &s;hould treat with us by a Mediator, and as we are Men, it was no le&s;s proper that he &s;hould do it by one that &s;hould appear in our own Nature, and conver&s;e fa|miliarly among us, that he might the better in&s;truct us by his Example as well as his Precepts.</P>
<P N="5">5. And as this was fit in it &s;elf, &s;o accordingly the Fact was, that in this incarnate State, he abundantly prov'd by his <HI>Miracles</HI> that he was indeed <HI>a Teacher come from GOD,</HI> and being cloathed with Divine Authority, he taught us all the great Principles of moral Truth and Duty, above demon|&s;trated, much more perfectly than ever they had been known before, and in a Manner and Language, admirably &s;uted to make the &s;tronge&s;t Impre&s;&s;ions upon the Minds of Men, not only of the more thinking, but even of the general Rate and the lowe&s;t Sort of the human Kind; and enjoined them upon us, under the mo&s;t weighty Sanctions and affecting Con&s;ide|rations, as the Will and Law of GOD concerning us; and at the &s;ame Time &s;et us a mo&s;t amiable Example that we &s;hould <HI>follow his Steps.</HI></P>

And, as it was highly expedient, that we &s;hould be &s;trongly affected with a Sen&s;e of the Heinou&s;ne&s;s of Sin, as the mo&s;t effectual Means to bring us to Repentance, and, at the &s;ame Time, have &s;ufficient Security of Pardon upon our Repentance; it plea&s;ed GOD to appoint that his Son, (voluntarily &s;ubmitting to it,) &s;hould die for both the&s;e Purpo&s;es; &mdash; that he &s;hould die in our Stead, as a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> for the Atonement of our Sins, and to &s;et before us an Emblem of the Greatne&s;s of our Guilt, and the Heinou&s;ne&s;s of our Sins in order to induce us to repent of them and for&s;ake them; and to purcha&s;e and en&s;ure <HI>Pardon</HI> and Ac|ceptance for us upon our Repentance and Reformation: which merciful Purpo&s;e and Intention he had exhibited from the Beginning by the In&s;titution of Sacrifices<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Ld. <HI>Forbes</HI>'s Thoughts concerning Religion, on the&s;e Subjects.</NOTE>. &mdash; Accord|ingly the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to &s;ubmit to a mo&s;t painful and ignominious Death, for our Sakes, mak|ing
<PB N="66" REF="005794_0064_1026F01C05C5E3D8"><HI>his Soul an Offering for our Sins,</HI> as the true Antitype of all the ancient Sacrifices.&mdash; And, thereupon (having pur|cha&s;ed a Right &s;o to do,) he did, in GOD's Name, promi&s;e and a&s;certain <HI>Pardon</HI> to our &s;incere Repentance and Return to our Duty, and the Acceptance of our faithful, though very weak, Endeavours, to yield a &s;tedfa&s;t and per&s;evering Obedience to all his holy Laws for the Time to come.</P>
<P N="7">7. And becau&s;e of our great Weakne&s;s and Inability to repent, reform and obey, without GOD's Help, amid &s;o many Temptations to the contrary, he has al&s;o, for CHRIST'S Sake, &s;ent his <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> (by whom he has always immedi|ately exerted his <HI>Almighty Power</HI> in the Creation and Govern|ment of the World,) and promi&s;ed his gracious <HI>A&s;&s;i&s;tance</HI> to enable us to with&s;tand the Temptations that lie in our Way; to mortify our Lu&s;ts and vicious Habits, and to comply with all the Duties incumbent upon us:&mdash; who accordingly is ever ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in all our hone&s;t and faithful Endeavours, and to render them effectual for the Renovation of our Souls, and enabling us to bring forth <HI>Fruits meet for Repentance,</HI> even all the Fruits of a &s;incere, univer&s;al and per&s;evering Obedience to the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P N="8">8. And &s;ince as Things now &s;tand, we cannot have much el&s;e in View be&s;ides a &s;hort and uncertain Life, attended with many Calamities and Death at the End of it, and &s;hould otherwi&s;e be generally attended with much Uncertainty about a future Life; CHRIST has, moreover, by his Sufferings and Death in our Behalf, taken away the Cur&s;e and Sting of our Calamities and Di&s;&s;olution, and turned them into a Ble&s;&s;ing and made them a Means of promoting our greate&s;t Good: and, has by his triumphant <HI>Re&s;urrection</HI> and <HI>A&s;cen&s;ion</HI> opened to us the glorious Views of a ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Immortality,</HI> both in Body and Soul, and a&s;certained to us an <HI>eternal Life</HI> of un&s;peakable Happine&s;s to be be&s;towed upon us, in Con&s;equence of our final Per&s;everance in Well-doing, conformable to his In|&s;tructions.</P>
<P N="9">9. And in the mean Time; as we could not, without In|&s;truction from above, &s;ufficiently know what Manner of <HI>Wor|&s;hip</HI>
<PB N="67" REF="005794_0065_1026F01DA1554788">and Service would be acceptable to GOD; it was very needful that CHRIST &s;hould teach us how to wor&s;hip and adore him acceptably, even in <HI>Spirit and in Truth.</HI>&mdash; And as GOD has been plea&s;ed to derive down all his Ble&s;&s;ings and Favours to us by the <HI>Mediation</HI> of his ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Son</HI> and the <HI>Influence</HI> of his <HI>Holy Spirit;</HI> &s;o it is fit, as he hath taught us, that all our Wor&s;hip and Service, our Prayers and Prai&s;es, &s;hould be offered up to him, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Holy Spirit, and through the Mediation of his dear Son, as the Condition of their obtaining Favour and Acceptance with him.</P>
<P N="10">10. And, <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> As every Thing that concerns the Weal of Mankind, is be&s;t promoted &s;ocial Combinations; &s;o GOD has by his Son JESUS CHRIST, appointed that we do jointly combine, or unite together in promoting our true Happine&s;s, which is the chief End of our Being, and live in the con&s;tant Exerci&s;e of <HI>&s;ocial Religion</HI> and Wor&s;hip for that Purpo&s;e. &mdash; And therefore, he has in&s;tituted <HI>Bapti&s;m,</HI> as a Rite of our Admittance into this Society, repre&s;enting and obliging us to all Purity and Holine&s;s in Heart and Life: &mdash; and the holy <HI>Euchari&s;t</HI> as a Means for keeping up a lively Sen&s;e of his Sufferings and Death, and of the mighty Obligations we are under to be faithful to him who is the great <HI>Author and Fini&s;her of our Faith,</HI> and to per&s;evere in Love and Unity one with another as Brethren and Fellow-Members of that holy Community of all good Men and An|gels, whereof he is the Head. &mdash; And he has, moreover appointed an <HI>Order of Men</HI> to admini&s;ter the&s;e &s;acred Rites, and to pre&s;ide in the Exerci&s;e of this &s;ocial Religion and Wor&s;hip, and explain and inculcate the <HI>Divine Philo&s;ophy</HI> which he hath taught us, in order to qualify and prepare us for that eternal Happine&s;s which he hath provided and a&s;|certained to us.</P>
<P N="11">11. Now, therefore, all tho&s;e who do firmly believe all the great Truths of this <HI>Holy Religion</HI> whether <HI>Natural</HI> or <HI>Revealed:</HI> i. e. whether founded in <HI>Nature,</HI> or meerly de|pending on <HI>Revelation;</HI> and under the Influence of them, do, by <HI>Faith,</HI> look for A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Acceptance only through

<HEAD>Mr. WALLASTON'S Prayer, R. N. p. 120. &s;omewhat enlarged.</HEAD>
<P>O Thou Almighty Being upon whom depends the Exi&s;|tence of the World and every Creature therein; by whom all Things are governed and conducted to their &s;everal Ends; and by who&s;e good Providence I have been mo&s;t kindly pre&s;erved and provided for, from the Begin|ning of my Life to this Moment, and enjoyed many unde&s;erv|ed Advantages and Favours, both for Body and Soul, and e&s;pecially the ine&s;timable Advantages of Chri&s;ianity: I be|&s;eech Thee graciou&s;ly to accept my mo&s;t grateful Sen&s;e and Ac|knowledgement of all thy Bounty and Beneficence towards me, (and particularly the Pre&s;ervation of the Night, [Day] pa&s;t) <HI>Let my Soul prai&s;e Thee while I live, and all that is within me ble&s;s thy holy Name.</HI></P>
<P>And, whereas, notwith&s;tanding the mighty Obligations of thy Goodne&s;s, I have, in many In&s;tances, ungratefully and perver&s;|ly &s;inned again&s;t thy mo&s;t righteous and rea&s;onable Laws; I hum|bly declare before Thee my utter Abhorrence of all my Perver&s;ene&s;s, and my &s;erious Re&s;olution to be more watchful against all Temptations, and to amend my Conduct for the Time to come. &mdash;And I earne&s;tly beg the Forgivene&s;s of my many Offences, and that thou wilt deliver me from the evil Con&s;equences of all my Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions and Follies; and endue me with &s;uch Di&s;po&s;itions and Powers, as may carry me innocently and &s;afely through all future Trials; and enable me, upon all Occa&s;ions to behave my &s;elf conformable to all the Laws of Rea&s;on and Nature, which are thy Laws; in all Wi&s;dom and Virtue; in Temperance, Piety, Justice and Charity; with a humble Dependance on thy infinite Wi&s;dom, Power and Goodne&s;s, and under an habitual Sen&s;e of thy All-&s;eeing Eye, and the Account I am to give of my &s;elf to Thee.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="005794_0068_1026F0256792A938">
I humbly beg Leave to command my &s;elf to thy gracious Protection and Conduct (this Day [Night] and) at all Times: Suffer none of thy Creatures to injure me, no Misfortune to befall me, nor me to hurt my &s;elf by any Error or Mi&s;conduct of my own;&mdash; and vouch&s;afe me clear and distinct Apprehen|&s;ions and a right Judgment in all Things, together with all virtuous Tempers and Di&s;po&s;itions, and &s;o much Health and Pro&s;perity as may be truly good for me in this pre&s;ent State of Probation.&mdash; Grant that I may, at lea&s;t, pa&s;s my Time in Peace with Contentment and Tranquility of Mind; and, that, having faithfully di&s;charged my Duty to Thee my GOD, to my Family and Friends, and to my Country and all Man|kind, and endeavoured to improve my &s;elf in all virtuous Ha|bits and u&s;eful Knowledge, I may at la&s;t make a calm and decent Exit, and happily find my &s;elf in a better State; a State of unmixed and endle&s;s Happine&s;s in the Life to come.&mdash;</P>
<P>All which, and what&s;oever el&s;e thou &s;ee&s;t needful, both for me and my Friends and all thy People, I humbly beg through the Mediation of thy ble&s;&s;ed Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, comprehending them with my &s;elf, in that excellent Form of Prayer which he hath taught us,&mdash; <HI>Our Father,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
