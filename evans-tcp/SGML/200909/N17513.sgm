<P N="1">1&s;t. WE believe that the fir&s;t light of &s;alvation was given or made known to the patriarchs by promi&s;e; and they that believed in the promi&s;e of CHRIST, and were obedient to the command of GOD made known unto them, were the people of GOD and were accepted of GOD as righteous, or perfect in their genera|tions; according to the mea&s;ure of light and truth manife&s;ted unto them; which was as waters to the ancles &s;ignified by <HI>Ezekiel</HI>'s vi&s;ion of the holy waters (chap|ter 47.) And altho' they could not receive regeneration or the fulne&s;s of &s;alvation, from the fle&s;hly or fallen nature in this life; becau&s;e the fulne&s;s of time was not yet come, that they &s;hould receive the bapti&s;m of the HOLY GHOST and fire; for the de&s;truction of the body of &s;in, and purification of the &s;oul: but <HI>Abram</HI> being
<PB N="4" REF="022664_0004_0FB9EBEB834E5040">called, and cho&s;en of GOD as the father of the faithful; was received into cove|nant relation with GOD by promi&s;e; that in him (and his &s;eed which was CHRIST) all the families of the earth &s;hould be ble&s;|&s;ed, and the&s;e earthly ble&s;&s;ings, which were promi&s;ed to <HI>Abram,</HI> were a &s;hadow of go&s;pel or &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ings to come: and circumci&s;ion, though it was a &s;eal of <HI>Abram</HI>'s faith, yet it was but a &s;ign of the mortification and de&s;truction of the fle&s;h by the go&s;pel in a future day. Ob&s;erve, circumci&s;ion, or outward cutting of the fore&s;kin of the fle&s;h, did not clean&s;e the man from &s;in; but was a &s;ign of the bapti&s;m of the HOLY GHOST and fire: which is by the power of GOD manife&s;ted in divers o|perations and gifts of the &s;pirit, as in the days of the apo&s;tles; which does indeed de&s;troy the body of &s;in, or fle&s;hly nature, and purify the man from all &s;in both &s;oul and body. So that <HI>Abram,</HI> though in the
<PB N="5" REF="022664_0005_0FB9EBEF646FF508">full faith of the promi&s;e; yet, as he did not receive the &s;ub&s;tance of the thing pro|mi&s;ed, his hope of eternal &s;alvation was in Chri&s;t, by the go&s;pel to be attained in the re&s;urrection from the dead.</P>
<P N="2">2d. THE &s;econd di&s;pen&s;ation was the law that was given of GOD to <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> by the hand of <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> which was a further manife&s;tation of that &s;alvation which was promi&s;ed through CHRIST by the go&s;pel, both in the order and ordinances which was in&s;tituted and given to <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> as the church and people of GOD according to that di&s;pen&s;ation; which was as waters to the ancles, <HI>Ezekiel</HI> XLVII. by which they were di&s;tingui&s;hed from all the families of the earth. For, while they were &s;trictly obedient to all the commands, odinances, and &s;tatutes, that GOD gave them, they were approbated of God according to the promi&s;e for life; and ble&s;&s;ing was promi&s;|ed
<PB N="6" REF="022664_0006_0FB9EBF4E874F2E8">unto them in the line of obedience: Cur&s;ing and death, in di&s;obedience: for GOD, who is ever jealous for the honor and glory of his own great name, always dealt with them according to his word: for while they were obedient to the command of GOD, and purged out &s;in from among&s;t them, GOD was with them, according to his promi&s;e. But when they di&s;obeyed the command of GOD, and committed &s;in, and became like other people, the hand of the LORD was turned again&s;t them; and tho&s;e evils came upon them which GOD had threatened; &s;o we &s;ee that they that were wholly obedient to the will of GOD made known in that di&s;pen&s;ation, were accepted as ju&s;t, or righteous: yet, as the di&s;pen&s;a|tion was &s;hort, they did not attain that &s;al|vation which was promi&s;ed in the go&s;pel; &s;o that as it re&s;pected the new-birth, or re|al purification of the man from all &s;in; the law made nothing perfect, but was a

<P N="3">3d. THE third di&s;pen&s;ation was the go&s;|pel of CHRIST'S fir&s;t appearance, in the fle&s;h: and that &s;alvation which took place in con&s;equence of his life, death, re|&s;urrection, and a&s;cen&s;ion at the right hand of the father being accepted in his obedi|ence, as the fir&s;t born among many bre|thren; he received power and authority to admini&s;ter the power of the re&s;urrec|tion, and eternal judgment to all the chil|dren of men: &s;o that he has become the author of eternal &s;alvation to all that obey him; and as CHRIST has this power in him&s;elf, he did admini&s;ter power and au|thority to his church at the day of Penti|co&s;t; as his body: with all the gifts that he had promi&s;ed them, which was the fir&s;t
<PB N="8" REF="022664_0008_0FB9EBF7698201D0">gift of the HOLY GHOST, as an in-dwel|ling comforter to abide with them forev|er: and by which they were bapti&s;ed into CHRIST'S death; death to all &s;in; and were in the hope of the re&s;urrection from the dead, through the operation of the power of GOD, which wrought in them. And as they had received the &s;ub&s;tance of the promi&s;e of CHRIST come in the fle&s;h, by the gift and power of the HOLY GHOST; they had power to preach the go&s;pel in CHRIST'S name to every creature; &mdash; and to admini&s;ter the power of GOD to as many as believed, and were obedient to the go&s;pel which they preached: and al&s;o to remit and retain &s;in in the name and au|thority of CHRIST on earth: &s;o that they that believed in the go&s;pel, and were obe|dient to that form of doctrine which was taught them; by denying all ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts; and became entirely dead to the law by the body of CHRIST,
<PB N="9" REF="022664_0009_0FB9EBF9F3AF56A8">or power of the HOLY GHOST, were in the travel of the re&s;urrection from the dead; or the redemption of the body. So that they who took up a full cro&s;s again&s;t the world, fle&s;h, and devil; and who for&s;ook all for CHRIST'S &s;ake; and followed him in the regeneration, by per&s;evering in that line of obedience to the end; found the re&s;urrection from the dead, and eternal &s;alvation in that di&s;pen&s;ation: but as the mea&s;ure of that di&s;pen&s;ation was only as water to the loins; the my&s;tery of GOD not fin&s;hed; but there was another day prophe&s;ied of, called the &s;econd appear|ance of CHRIST, or final and la&s;t di&s;play of GOD'S grace to a lo&s;t world: in which the my&s;tery of GOD &s;hould be fini&s;hed as he has &s;poken by his prophets &s;ince the world began: which day could not come, ex|cept there was a falling away from that faith and power that the church then &s;tood in; in which time anti-chri&s;t was to have
<PB N="10" REF="022664_0010_0FB9EC0117A2A0F0">his reign, whom CHRIST &s;hould de&s;troy with the &s;pirit of his mouth and bright|ne&s;s of his appearance: which falling a|way began &s;oon after the apo&s;tles, and gradually increa&s;ed in the church, until about four hundred and fifty&s;even years from CHRIST'S birth (or thereabouts) at which time the power of the HOLY PEOPLE, or church of CHRIST, was &s;cattered or lo&s;t by rea&s;on of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion: and anti-chri&s;t, or fal&s;e religion, got to be e&s;tabli&s;hed. Since that time the witne&s;&s;es of CHRIST have prophe&s;ied in &s;ackloth or under darkne&s;s; and altho' many have been faithful to te&s;ti|fy again&s;t &s;in; even to the laying down of their lives for the te&s;timony which they held; &s;o that GOD accepted them in their obedience: while they were faithful and ju&s;t to live or walk up to the mea&s;ure of light and truth of GOD, revealed or made known unto them, but as it is written, that all they that will live godly in CHRIST
<PB N="11" REF="022664_0011_0FB9EC01F6600F28">JESUS, &s;hall &s;uffer per&s;ecution: and &s;o it has been, and tho&s;e faithful witne&s;&s;es lo&s;t their lives, by tho&s;e fal&s;ly called the church of CHRIST: which is anti-chri&s;t; for the true church of CHRIST never per&s;ecuted a|ny; but were inoffen&s;ive, harmle&s;s, &s;epa|rate from &s;in: for the true church of CHRIST taking up their cro&s;s again&s;t the world, fle&s;h, and devil, and all &s;in, living in obedience to GOD they earne&s;tly con|tend for the &s;ame. Therefore it may be plainly &s;een and known, where the true church of CHRIST is: but as it is written anti-chri&s;t or fal&s;e churches &s;hould prevail again&s;t the &s;aints and overcome them, be|fore CHRIST'S &s;econd appearance, 2 <HI>The&s;&s;.</HI> 11.</P>
<P N="3">3. Let no man deceive you by any means for that day &s;hall not come except there come a falling away fir&s;t; and that man of &s;in be revealed, the &s;on of perdition, <HI>Rev.</HI> xiii. 7. And it was given unto him to overcome them, and power was given him

<P N="4">4th. THE fourth di&s;pen&s;ation or day is the &s;econd appearance of CHRIST, or final, or la&s;t di&s;play of GOD'S grace to a lo&s;t world, in which the my&s;tery of GOD will be fini&s;hed and a deci&s;ive work, to the final &s;alvation, or damnation of all the children

To a number, in the manife&s;tation of great light and mighty trembling by the invi&s;ible power of GOD, and vi&s;ions, and revelations, and prophecies; which has progre&s;&s;ively increa&s;ed, with admini&s;tra|tion of all tho&s;e &s;piritual gifts, that was admini&s;tered to the apo&s;tles at the day of Pentico&s;t: which is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">forter that has led us into all truth: which was pro|mi&s;ed to abide with the true church of CHRIST unto the end of the world, and by which we find bapti&s;m into CHRIST'S death; death to all &s;in, become alive to GOD, by the power of CHRIST'S re&s;urrec|tion, which worketh in us mightily; by which a di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel is com|mitted unto us; and woe be unto us if we

We have found repentance of all our &s;ins; and are made partakers of the grace of GOD where|in we now &s;tand: which all others in be|lieving and obeying, have acceptance with GOD, and find &s;alvation from their &s;ins as well as we; GOD being no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons but willing that all &s;hould come to the knowledge of the truth, and be &s;aved. Thus we have given a &s;hort information of what we believe of the di&s;pen&s;ations of GOD'S grace to mankind, both pa&s;t and pre&s;ent: and in what manner the people of GOD have found ju&s;tification, or ac|ceptance with GOD, which was and is &s;till

O! that you would hearken! for then there is the &s;ame door for your e&s;cape, as for the re&s;t of the children of men; at which door, if you enter, I feel to receive you with charity: and the &s;everity of this letter, is the charity of GOD for your &s;ouls; and his abhorence of your fal&s;e hopes.</P>
