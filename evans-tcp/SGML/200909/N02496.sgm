<P>At what in&s;tant I &s;hall &s;peak concerning a Nation, and concerning a Kingdom to pluck up, and to pull down, and to de&s;troy it: If that Nation again&s;t whom I have pro|nounced, turn from their Evil, I will re|pent of the Evil that I thought to do unto them.</P></Q>

<P>IN this Chapter, 1. We have a Declara|tion of God's <HI>Sovereign Power</HI> to deal with a People as He plea&s;eth, under the <HI>Parable</HI> or Similitude of a <HI>Potter</HI> and his <HI>Clay,</HI> ver. 1,&mdash;6. If the Potter hath power over his yellow Clay to fa&s;hion it as he will; &s;urely that God, who hath given being to us and all Creatures, may di&s;po&s;e of us as &s;eemeth good in His &s;ight, Rom. 9.
<PB N="2" REF="002958_0004_0FE6A61D2C4CE588">20, 1. <HI>Nay but O man, who art thou that repli|e&s;t again&s;t God? &s;hall the thing formed &s;ay to him that formed it, why ha&s;t thou made me thus? Hath not the potter power over the clay&mdash;?</HI> 2. God &s;hews that in his Dealings with Nations, He acts as a <HI>righteous Judge;</HI> yea as a God gracious and merciful, <HI>ver.</HI> 7,&mdash;10. At what in&s;tant&mdash;God &s;peaks again&s;t a People when He threatens to bring de&s;ola|ting Judgments upon them, and 'tis implied that this is for their Sins, whereby they tran&s;gre&s;s His holy Laws: This is the ground of the Controver&s;y. Notwith&s;tand|ing, we are here a&s;&s;ur'd that tho' a &s;inful People give God cau&s;e to come out again&s;t them, &s;o that if He &s;hould mark iniquity they could not &s;tand; yet He is not wont to deal with them in a way of rigorous Ju&s;tice; but fir&s;t threatens and warns, be|fore He comes out again&s;t them to de&s;troy them: Yea, that if they take the Warning, and turn from the Evil of their Sins unto unto Him; God will al&s;o repent of the Evil of Puni&s;hment He threatned to bring upon them, and &s;tay His Hind. Not as if God chang'd His Mind, or alter'd His Decree. No! He is the Almighty, All-wi&s;e, and Unchangeable God. <HI>I am the Lord, I change not</HI>&mdash;Mal. 3.6. God is of one mind, and who can turn Him? God can do nothing but what is worthy of His infinite Perfecti|ons,
<PB N="3" REF="002958_0005_0FE6A5E8B699C0B0">and therefore He can't Repent in a &s;trict and proper &s;en&s;e, 1 Sam. 15.29. <HI>The Strength of I&s;rael will not Repent</HI>&mdash; He is not a Man that He &s;hould Repent. However, God is &s;aid to Repent, &s;peaking after the manner of Men, when He changeth His way, and the Cour&s;e of His Providence towards a Per&s;on or People, <HI>Gen.</HI> 6.6. <HI>Jon</HI> 3.10. A|greeably, the Expre&s;&s;ion here us'd intends that God would not execute the Judgments denounced, nor bring the threatned Evil up|on them; but <HI>e c.</HI> would return unto them in a way of Grace and Favour. On the o|ther hand, God &s;hews that His Promi&s;es of pro&s;pering and e&s;tabli&s;hing a People are Conditional, ver. 9, 10. <HI>If it do Evil, I will repent of the good</HI> &mdash; God will &s;top the Cour&s;e of His Mercies, and walk con|trary to them. Now the due Ob&s;ervance of the&s;e Rules would help us to under&s;tand the Ju&s;tice, Truth and Equity of God's Pro|vidential Di&s;pen&s;ations towards His ancient People, and others. 3. We have the Im|provement of the foregoing Di&s;cour&s;e with an <HI>e&s;pecial Application</HI> to God's Covenant People the Jews, ver. 11,&mdash;17. In which the <HI>Prop et</HI> is commanded to declare to the Men of <HI>Judah,</HI> that God was framing Evil again&s;t them; and then to call them to Re|pentance and Amendment of life, <HI>ver.</HI> 11.

We have an account of the People's de&s;|perate re&s;olution to plot mi&s;chievous De|vices again&s;t <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> becau&s;e he faithfully delivered God's Me&s;&s;age to them, <HI>ver.</HI> 18. <HI>ad &s;in.</HI> And then an Imprecation of Judg|ment, in which the Prophet was not acted by an evil &s;pirit of per&s;onal Revenge: He de&s;ir'd not the <HI>woful Day;</HI> but by the Spirit of Prophecy.</P>

AT what in&s;tant I &s;peak, to pluck up &mdash; God utters His Voice in dreadful Threat|nings before He gives the fatal blow. He cau&s;eth the Woe-Trumpets to &s;ound before He pours out the Vials of His Wrath.

<P N="1">1. <HI>IN and by His Word.</HI> Herein God's Wrath is reveal'd from Heaven again&s;t all ungodline&s;s and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s of Men.

And therefore this Word is to be received not as the Word of Men; but as indeed it is the Word of God. <HI>Thus faith the Lord.</HI> And this Word of God abideth in full force and virtue throughout all Generations, 1 Pet. 1.24, 5. <HI>All fle&s;h is as gra&s;s</HI> &mdash; <HI>But the word of the Lord endureth for ever.</HI> It not only concerns tho&s;e to whom it was nextly directed; but all to whom it comes, and they may <HI>a&s;&s;ure</HI> them&s;elves that if their Ca&s;e be the &s;ame it will take place on them.

An&s;w. 1.

But alas! Such is the Power of deceitful Lu&s;ts, to blind Mens minds, that they flatter them&s;elves in their own Eyes. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 36.2. Agreably there is a woe denounced again&s;t tho&s;e that <HI>call Evil Good, and Good Evil;</HI> that put Darkne&s;s for Light &mdash; <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 5.20. Wicked Men who&s;e under&s;tanding is dark|ne&s;s, have wrong notions of God, of Sin, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For in their Practical Judgments, they pre|fer the gratification of their Lu&s;ts before the enjoyment of God. The old Man is Corrupt according to Deceitful Lu&s;ts; &s;o that while a Per&s;on or People are under the governing influence of Sin, they do not make a right Judgment concerning the Nature and pernicious Con&s;equences of this Dead|ly Evil. But when God gives them Re|pentance, he &s;ends his Spirit to Convince them of Sin, making them to &s;ee and know that it is, <HI>an evil and bitter thing that they have for&s;aken the Lord their God.</HI> Such a people, are brought to con&s;ider and realize it, that they have Di&s;honoured God, and Wounded them&s;elves, by their Iniquities. God &s;ays to them. Thou ha&s;t <HI>fallen by thine Iniquities,</HI> Ho&s;. 14.1. Thou ha&s;t de&s;troy'd thy&s;elf; and his Word is quick and power|ful,

Such a Con|viction as this is given by the Spirit of God, commanding the Ble&s;&s;ing on the Calls of His Word and Providence, when a Peo|ple attend to this great Duty of Repen|tance. The &s;aving Convictions made on God's Children are reviv'd; &s;o that they awake out of their &s;leepy frames, and be|come active and vigorous in promoting the nece&s;&s;ary Work of Reformation.

<P N="5">5. A Penitent People <HI>Turn from their Evil Ways, and Return to the Lord their God.</HI> Thus a People's Repenting is expre&s;s'd in the Text by <HI>turning from their Evil,</HI> i. e. the Evil of Sin, which is the wor&s;t and the only Evil that &s;tirs up God's holy di&s;plea|&s;ure <HI>against</HI> a Per&s;on, or Nation. The true Penitent not only confe&s;&s;eth, but al&s;o for|&s;aketh his Sin. <HI>Prov.</HI> 28.13. There's a turning from Sin in inward <HI>Aver&s;ion</HI> to it, and an hearty endeavour to put it far away as the abominable thing he hateth. Agre|ably, Repentance is called Repentance <HI>from dead works, Heb.</HI> 6.1. i e. Sins, which are dead Works; for they proceed from the body of Death in us, and if per&s;i&s;ted in, end in Death. Sin when it is fini&s;hed bringeth forth Death. Accordingly, it is not enough that a degenerate People &s;anctify Fa&s;ts, confe&s;s their Sins, and promi&s;e Amendment. No! they mu&s;t for&s;ake them and reform, or they do not Repent, Ezek. 14.6. <HI>Say unto the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, Thus &s;aith the Lord God, Repent and turn your &s;elves from your idols, and turn away your faces from all your abominations.</HI> There mu&s;t be a fixed Re&s;o|lution, by the help of God, to abandon our
<PB N="19" REF="002958_0021_0FE6A5E777AFE3D0">Sins, and this mu&s;t be put in execution: The Wicked mu&s;t for&s;ake their Thoughts, and evil Ways. As the Children of I&s;rael, <HI>put away the &s;trange gods</HI> from among them, and &s;erved the Lord: and His Soul was grieved for the mi&s;ery of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> Judg. 10.16. We mu&s;t not hold fa&s;t our Iniquities, refu|&s;ing to let them go; but mu&s;t break off our Sins by Repentance. We mu&s;t in our &s;e|veral Places &s;eriou&s;ly engage in the Work of Reformation. <HI>Civil Rulers</HI> in their Pla|ces mu&s;t lead in this nece&s;&s;ary Work, im|proving their Authority to &s;uppre&s;s tho&s;e Evils which threaten the De&s;truction of their People, as they provoke God to de|part from them; they mu&s;t endeavour to turn away Wrath, by being a Terror, not to Good Works, but to the Evil.

It was &s;aid even of <HI>Nineveh,</HI> Jon. 3.10. <HI>God &s;aw their works, that they turned from their evil way</HI>&mdash;. I would hope &s;ome of them were &s;o taught the knowledge of the true God, and of the only way of Salvation by the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah, that they &s;incerely repented, and were eternally &s;aved. How|ever there mu&s;t be, as there was among them, an outward prevailing Reformation of tho&s;e hainous Evils for which God threatens De&s;truction. And upon this, we find God hath &s;par'd a finful People; as the <HI>Nenevites;</HI> and His Covenant People <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> delivering them from tho&s;e publick Cala|mities which threatned their ruin; tho' it appear'd afterwards by their &s;peedy A|po&s;tacy, when the Judgments were removed, that the generality of the People were not thoroughly reformed, not &s;ted fa&s;t in God's Covenant. Upon the account of which, God again and again turn'd again&s;t them, and puni&s;hed them &s;even times for their Iniquities. So that in order to a People's obtaining la&s;ting Peace in the enjoyment of God's e&s;pecial Favour and Ble&s;&s;ing, it is
<PB N="21" REF="002958_0023_0FE6A5F8B3C75F00">needful that they be generally &s;incere in their Repentance, &amp; thorow in their Refor|mation. In which there is an hearty Turning from all known Sin, as it is contrary to the revealed will &amp; declarative Glory of God, and a returning to that One God, who is the Father the Son and the Holy Gho&s;t, as to our highe&s;t End and chief Good; as to our Lord and Portion; to walk in His Ways, and keep all His Commandments, 1 Kin. 8.48. <HI>And &s;o return unto thee with all their heart, and with all their &s;oul.</HI> There mu&s;t be &s;uch a Repentance <HI>towards God,</HI> Act. 20.21.

The Power of Godline&s;s mu&s;t take place among us in the general E&s;tabli&s;hment of pure and undefiled Religion, in Doctrine, Wor&s;hip and Manners.

<P>GOD often Threatens a People and Warns them with a gracious De&s;ign of De|livering them, by Awakening and &s;o Re|forming of them, &amp;c. But I now proceed to make &s;ome brief <HI>Improvement</HI> of what hath been already d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="4 letters">ered.</P>

No! <HI>The Judge of all the Earth doth right:</HI> He proceeds in Judgment according to known and e&s;tabli&s;h'd Rules of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and makes it appear that Ju&s;tice and Judgment are the Habitation of his Throne. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 89.14. God could Appeal to his People. Ezek. 18.25, &mdash; 29. <HI>Hear now, O hou&s;e of I&s;rael, Is not my way equal? Are not your ways unequal? When a righteous man turneth away from his righteou&s;ne&s;s, and committeth iniquity, and dieth in them; for his iniquity that he hath done, &s;hall he die. Again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedne&s;s that he hath committed, and doth
<PB N="24" REF="002958_0026_0FE6A5F8D66C8E08">that which is lawful and right, he &s;hall &s;ave his &s;oul alive.

Yet &s;aith the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, The way of the Lord is not equal. O hou&s;e of I&s;rael, are not my ways equal?

There's none of God's Di&s;pen&s;ations towards the Children of Men, but what may be fairly accounted for from a due Con&s;ideration of the Cove|nant of Works which God at fir&s;t entred into with <HI>Adam,</HI> "not only for him&s;elf, but for his Po&s;terity"; of the Covenant of Grace, and of the State of Mankind, as the World is under the Government of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, God-Man-Mediator.

<P>WHEN God threatens a &s;inful People with De&s;truction, there's yet a Re&s;erve of Mercy. The Threatning is not &s;o ab&s;olute as to leave no place for Repentance, Jer. 36.2, 3. <HI>Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have &s;poken unto thee again&s;t I&s;rael, and again&s;t Judah, and against all the nations from the day I &s;pake unto thee, from the days of Jo&s;iah, even unto this day.

<Q>The Omni&s;cient God could not be at a lo&s;s about the Event; but this is &s;poken of the All knowing God after the man|ner of Men, to &s;hew how acceptable to Him true Repentance is.</Q></P>

<P N="1">1. IT will appear, if we con&s;ider <HI>the gracious Promi&s;es and Declarations of God's Word.</HI> There are great and precious Pro|mi&s;es made to the Penitent by the true God. Indeed God hath not ab&s;olutely pro|mis'd particular Per&s;ons temporal Delive|rance

He will dwell among them, be their God, and own them for his People. And the Affliction they &s;uffer &s;hall be &s;anctified to &s;eperate them from their Sins; and not be &s;ent in Wrath for their De&s;truction.

By this therefore the iniquity of Jacob &s;hall be purged, and this is the fruit to take away his &s;in.</HI> And thus God &s;peaks very graciou&s;ly concerning them that were carried Captive with <HI>Jeconiah,</HI> Jer. 24.5,&mdash;7. <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord the God of I&s;rael, like the&s;e good figs, &s;o will I acknowledge them that are carried away captive of Judah, whom I have &s;ent out of this place into the land of the Cal|deans for their good.

<P N="2">2. THIS appears from <HI>the Provi&s;ion made for true Penitents in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and from the Constitution of the Covenant of Grace.</HI> God hath made abundant Provi&s;ion for the Salvation of His People in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who hath offer'd a Sacrifice of Atonement for the Congregation of His People, who look to Him by Faith, mourn for their Sins, and turn from them unto the Lord. Agreably, <HI>Aaron</HI> was commanded to offer a <HI>Sin-offer|ing</HI> for the People, with the blood of which he was to <HI>make Atonement</HI> for all the Con|gregation of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> Lev. 16.15&mdash;17. Thus on the <HI>Day</HI> of <HI>Atonement</HI> they were to afflict their Souls, and offer an Offering made by Fire unto the Lord, <HI>Lev.</HI> 23.27. Thus, tho Congregation of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were to <HI>kill</HI> the <HI>Pa&s;&s;over, and &s;prinkle the Blood upon the door|po&s;ts&mdash;that the de&s;troyer might not come into their hou&s;es.</HI> Exod. 12.

God will &s;ay of them, &s;pare them from going down to the Pit, I have found a ran&s;om. And tho' it be true, that none &s;hall receive the ever|la&s;ting benefit of Chri&s;t's Sacrifice, but &s;uch us heartily receive the Lord Je&s;us, mouth|ing for their &s;ins with a godly Sorrow, yet the Body of a People fare the better on temporal accounts, and God will not de&s;troy them, where &s;uch a frame of &s;pirit is found prevailing among them. <HI>Zech.</HI> 12.6. &mdash; 10. And this is plain from the nature and tenor of the <HI>New Covenant,</HI> the Cove|nant of Grace, in which God gives encou|ragement, not only to &s;ingle Per&s;ons, but al&s;o to His People to Repent, that their Sins may be blotted out, and their Iniqui|ties not be their ruin. Jer. 31.31, &mdash; 36. <HI>Behold, the days come &s;aith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, and with the hou&s;e of Judah: Not ac|cording to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt (which my covenant they brake, although I was an hus|band unto them, &s;aith the Lord,) But this &s;hall

And they &s;hall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, &s;aying, know the Lord: for they &s;hall all know me, from the lea&s;t of them unto the greatest of them, &s;aith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will re|member their &s;in no more. Thus &s;aith the Lord, which giveth the &s;un for a light by day, and the ordinances if the moon and of the &s;tars for a light by night, which divideth the &s;ea when the waves thereof roar; the Lord of ho&s;ts is his name.

But when they de&s;pi&s;ed the Means of Grace, and abu&s;ed them to harden them&s;elves in Sin, as if they were deliver'd to do the&s;e and the other Abominations, and might Sin with impunity: I &s;ay, when it was thus. God re|mov'd the&s;e vi&s;ible Tokens of His Pre&s;ence and Favour, Jer. 7.9, 10. <HI>Will ye steal, mur|der and commit adultery, and &s;wear fal&s;ely, and burn incen&s;e unto Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye know not. And come and &s;tand before me in this hou&s;e which is called by my Name, and &s;ay, we are delivered to do all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> abominations?</HI> ver. 14. <HI>Therefore will I do unto this hou&s;e which is called by my Name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you, and to your fathers, as I have done to Shilob.</HI> The <HI>Ark</HI> was an e&s;pecial Token of God's Pre&s;ence; but when the I&s;raelites refu&s;ed to repent and turn to the Lord, God gave it up into the hands of their Enemies, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 4. The <HI>Temple</HI> af|terwards with the holy things in it, was
<PB N="47" REF="002958_0049_0FE6A65851582F80">the great <HI>Medium</HI> of their in&s;tituted Wor|&s;hip; But when they boa&s;ted of God's holy Mountain, crying, The Temple of the Lord, as if this would &s;ecure God's Pre|&s;ence, notwith&s;tanding their Impenitency, God in His over-ruling Providence burnt and de&s;troy'd it, fir&s;t by the <HI>Chaldeans,</HI> then by the <HI>Romans;</HI> and ca&s;t them out of His &s;ight. And thus God threatned the Church of <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> Rev. 2.5. <HI>Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen; and repent and do the fir&s;t works, or el&s;e I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candle&s;tick out of his place, except thou repent.</HI> And what a fearful Example for the Con|firmation of the truth before us, have we in this, and the other <HI>A&s;ian Churches,</HI> once highly favour'd with the light and privi|ledges of the Go&s;pel?</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>WHEN God is thus departed, and His Covenant broken, Destroying Judgments enter in, and make a People de&s;olate.</HI> Now the Glory and Defence of a People are gone; And there's a wide breach made at which de&s;olating Judgments come pouring in as an overflowing Scourge. They who have been thus highly &s;avour'd, but refu&s;e to be the Lord's People, provoke Him to pluck them up, and de&s;troy them from be|ing a People in the Earth. Thus God threatned that <HI>Ephraim &s;hould be broken, that
<PB N="48" REF="002958_0050_0FE6A64E1BF2B578">it be not a people,</HI> I&s;ai. 7.8. And apo&s;tate <HI>I&s;rael</HI> is forbidden to rejoyce as other Peo|ple; becau&s;e they had gone a whoring from their God, <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 9.1. Others may for a time pro&s;per in outward re&s;pects, tho' God be not their Covenant God; but when His People break His Covenant, and refu&s;e to return unto Him, their Civil and Religious Priviledges, their Outward and Spiritual Enjoyments have been taken away together. When <HI>I&s;rael</HI> for&s;ook the Lord, and he had rejected them, their Civil and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Con&s;titution was broken, and they were &s;cattered abroad to the four Winds of Heaven. How pathetically did our Saviour lament over them when He &s;aw their Ruin approaching! Mat. 23 37, 8. <HI>O Jeru&s;alem, Jeru&s;alem, thou that kille&s;t the Prophets, and &s;tone&s;t them which are &s;ent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy chil|dren together even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not. Behold, your hou&s;e is left unto you de&s;olate.</HI></P>

Our Lord Him&s;elf, the great Prophet of His Church, began His publick Mini&s;try with Preaching this Doctrine, Mat. 4.17. <HI>From that time Je&s;us began to preach and to &s;ay, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</HI> The Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> preach'd this Doctrine to the Jews, <HI>Act.</HI> 2.38.
