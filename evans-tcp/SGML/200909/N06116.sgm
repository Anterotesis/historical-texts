<P>For as the learned, <HI>Ain&s;worth</HI> well ob&s;erves, This is the mo&s;t doleful P&s;alm in all the Bible: full of Lamentation, Mourning and Woe, from the Beginning to the End; without the lea&s;t Gleam of Hope or Com|fort, unle&s;s it be in the 1&s;t. 2d, and 13th Ver&s;es; where the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> &s;eems to &s;ignify&mdash;He apprehended, that all his Salvation mu&s;t come from God, and that it was at lea&s;t <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> that God might hear and &s;ave him: but higher than a <HI>bare Po&s;&s;ibility</HI> thereof, in his Di&s;tre&s;s and Darkne&s;s, he does not &s;eem to ri&s;e</P>

<P>This has been indeed conte&s;ted among the Learned. But it being of Moment in the Ca&s;e before us, we mu&s;t endeavour to clear this Matter.</P>
<P>For in the <HI>Title</HI> of <HI>this P&s;alm,</HI> the Compo&s;ure &s;eems to be a&s;cribed to <HI>Heman</HI> the <HI>Ezrahite,</HI> as the <HI>following P&s;alm</HI> to <HI>Ethan</HI> the <HI>Ezrahite:</HI> And as there were a <HI>Heman</HI> and <HI>Ethan</HI> two famous <HI>Brethren</HI> for <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> of the Tribe of <HI>Judah,</HI> and another <HI>Heman</HI> and <HI>E|than</HI> chief and contemporary Ma&s;ters of the &s;acred <HI>Mu&s;ick,</HI> of the Tribe of <HI>Levi;</HI> &s;ome learned Men a&s;|cribe the&s;e two P&s;alms re&s;pectively to the <HI>two former,</HI> and others to the <HI>two latter.</HI> For,</P>

<P N="2">2. As <HI>Levi</HI> had three Sons, viz. <HI>Ger&s;hom, Kohath</HI> and <HI>Merari;</HI> there was another <HI>Heman</HI> who was the Son of <HI>Joel,</HI> the Son of <HI>Samuel</HI> the Prophet, of the Family of <HI>Kohath;</HI> which <HI>Heman</HI> liv'd in <HI>David</HI>'s Reign, and is called a <HI>Singer,</HI> or the chief of the Mu&s;icians, 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> vi. 33. i. e. cho&s;en by the <HI>Levites</HI> and ap|proved of by <HI>David,</HI> Chap. xv, after his reigning at <HI>He|bron</HI> &s;even Years and an half from the Death of <HI>Saul,</HI> and upon the Death of <HI>I&s;hbo&s;heth</HI> a&s;cending to the Throne of all <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> taking Mount <HI>Zion,</HI> and there building his Palace, placing the Ark and Tabernacle,

and &s;etting the <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Levites</HI> in their &s;everal Or|ders for the beauteous carrying on of the public Wor|&s;hip: <HI>A&s;aph</HI> of the Family of <HI>Ger&s;hom</HI> &s;tanding at <HI>Heman</HI>'s Right Hand, and <HI>Ethan,</HI> &s;ometimes called <HI>Jeduthun</HI> of the Family of <HI>Merari,</HI> on his Left, when they led the &s;acred Songs with In&s;truments of Mu&s;ick before the Ark and in the Tabernacle.</P>
<P>And it &s;eems &s;urprizing, that &s;o many learned Men &s;hould &s;ugge&s;t the <HI>former Heman,</HI> and <HI>Ethan</HI> of the Tribe of <HI>Judah</HI> while in <HI>Egypt,</HI> were the Authors of the&s;e two P&s;alms re&s;pectively. For, (1) It &s;eems by no Means likely that <HI>Poetry</HI> and <HI>P&s;almody</HI> were ad|vanc'd to &s;uch Perfection among the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> in tho&s;e early Times before the Days of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and near a <HI>Hundred</HI> Years before their coming out of <HI>Egypt:</HI> and according to &s;uch a Suppo&s;ition, the 88th &amp; 89th <HI>P&s;alms</HI> &s;hould in the Order of Time have been placed &s;o many Years before the <HI>Song</HI> in the 15th Chapter of <HI>Exodus;</HI> which being compo&s;ed by that mo&s;t learned and admirable Writer <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> is generally accounted to be the <HI>fir&s;t divine Song</HI> extant in this lower World&punc; (2) The <HI>only Rea&s;on</HI> why any learned Men imagine the Com|po&s;ers of <HI>the&s;e two P&s;alms</HI> re&s;pectively were <HI>Heman</HI> and <HI>Ethan</HI> the Sons of <HI>Zerah,</HI> is becau&s;e the <HI>Titles</HI> call them <HI>Heman</HI> the <HI>Ezrahite</HI> and <HI>Ethan</HI> the <HI>Ezra|hite:</HI> But whoever reads the <HI>following P&s;alm</HI> a&s;crib'd to <HI>Ethan,</HI> will find &s;uch preci&s;e Accounts of God's <HI>having rai&s;ed up, anointed</HI> and <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed David</HI> on the Throne of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> with the &s;olemn <HI>Oath</HI> which God had made him of the Continuance of his Offspring on it, and as having ca&s;t off and abhorred his anointed, &s;eemingly made void his Covenant, and profan'd his Crown, by ca&s;ting it to the Ground &amp;c; as is utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with the Time of <HI>Ethan</HI> and <HI>Heman,</HI> the Sons of <HI>Zerah,</HI> who lived above <HI>four Hundred</HI> Years before <HI>David</HI> had a Being. But (3) What intirely
<PB N="4" REF="007769_0006_102E7933DDD471B0">
decides the Matter is, that in the very <HI>Title</HI> of <HI>this</HI> 88th <HI>P&s;alm,</HI> 'tis &s;aid to be <HI>for the</HI> SONS <HI>of</HI> KORAH, <HI>to the chief Mu&s;ician Ma&s;chil of</HI> HEMAN <HI>the Ezrahite.</HI> For <HI>Korah</HI> was the Grand-&s;on of <HI>Kohath,</HI> as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was, and went out of <HI>Egypt</HI> with him: and from <HI>Ko|rah</HI> de&s;cended <HI>Heman,</HI> appointed the chief Ma&s;ter of the &s;acred Mu&s;ick in the Reign of <HI>David;</HI> as in 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> vi, xv, &amp; xxv.</P>
<P>But why both <HI>Heman</HI> in the <HI>Title</HI> of <HI>this P&s;alm,</HI> and <HI>Ethan</HI> of the <HI>next,</HI> are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Name <HI>Ezrahite,</HI> &s;eems at pre&s;ent utterly uncertain.</P>
<P>This <HI>Heman</HI> is al&s;o called <HI>the King's</HI> [i.e. King <HI>Da|vid's</HI>] SEER <HI>in the Words of God,</HI> 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> xxv. 5. which &s;eems a Character yet higher and more di&s;tin|gui&s;hing: For it &s;eems to &s;ignify, that he was an in&s;pired Prophet, as his Grand-father <HI>Samuel</HI> had been, and as <HI>Gad</HI> then was: who were both called <HI>Seers;</HI> and in 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> ix. 9. we read &mdash; <HI>Before time in</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>when a Man went to enquire of God, thus he &s;pake, "Come and let us go to the Seer:" for he that is now called a</HI> PROPHET, <HI>was before time called a</HI> SEER; &mdash; as well as that this <HI>Heman</HI> was cho&s;en and appointed to <HI>pre&s;ide</HI> over that prophetical and &s;acred Work of &s;etting forth the Prai&s;es of God, by P&s;alms, Trumpets and high &s;ounding Cymbals &amp;c.</P>
<P>By all the&s;e Things it appears, that <HI>Heman</HI> was a Man of eminent De&s;cent and Piety, high in the E&s;teem of the <HI>Levites,</HI> and high in the E&s;teem of King <HI>David,</HI> and by them exalted to a high Place of Dignity and Influence.</P>
<P>And yet all his inward Qualifications join'd with all the&s;e outward Re&s;pects and Honours did not &s;ecure him from a con&s;tant Series of Affliction, even from his Youth all along to his advanced Age. For at the <HI>Time</HI> of his being rai&s;ed to his &s;acred Dignity, which &s;eems to be at the Tran&s;lation of the Ark and Tabernacle to
<PB N="5" REF="007769_0007_102E7935639FE368">
Mount <HI>Zion,</HI> and before the penning of this P&s;alm, we read in the &s;ame Ver&s;e, viz. 1 Chron. xxv. 5; <HI>God gave to</HI> Heman <HI>fourteen Sons and three Daughters:</HI> And if they were all born at the Time of his Exalta|tion, He was now come to hoary Hairs of Piety, and 'tis likely even to <HI>Three&s;core</HI> Years of Age, when he compos'd this P&s;alm, even to be &s;ung in Publick at the Tabernacle in &s;uch &s;orrowful Strains as the&s;e&mdash; <HI>I am afflicted and ready to die from my Youth up;</HI> while <HI>I &s;uffer thy Terrors I am di&s;tracted.</HI></P>
<P>And it &s;eems highly probable, that he knew &s;ome, if not many others in the A&s;&s;embly, his Companion <HI>A&s;aph</HI> it &s;eems was one as we may &s;how hereafter, in the &s;ame di&s;tre&s;s'd Condition, &amp; could readily join with him in &s;ing|ing this mo&s;t mournful Ditty. Yea others al&s;o, and even tho&s;e who were then rejoycing in the Light of the Face of God &s;hining on them, might yet affectionately join in &s;inging this Song with <HI>Heman</HI> &amp; <HI>others.</HI> For <HI>Love</HI> to good People is a wondrou&s;ly uniting Principle: it makes us one with them: it makes us feel as they, re|joyc'd as they, di&s;tre&s;s'd as they, and with them to Pray and Prai&s;e as they.</P>
<P>Yea, <HI>Heman</HI> in <HI>this very P&s;alm</HI> before us, in the very Darkne&s;s of his Di&s;pondency;&mdash; yet cannot help giving &s;everal plain <HI>Intimations</HI> of his <HI>excelling Piety.</HI>&mdash; As for In&s;tance&mdash;</P>
<P>In ver. 1, <HI>O Lord God of my Salvation, I have cried Day and Night before Thee!</HI> He believ'd in the only true, living and &s;upream God Jehovah&mdash;the &s;ame God who had reveal'd him&s;elf to all the ancient Prophets in&s;pir'd before him, and in all his In&s;pirations by them. He apprehended and in Faith look'd up to Him, as the God of his Salvation: and in Faith and Prayer he had continually cried before Him, as in his Eye and Pre&s;ence.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="007769_0008_102E79381994A908">In ver. 2, <HI>Let my Prayer come before Thee: incline thine Ear unto my Cry!</HI> Tho' the Lord had &s;o long, &s;o many Years deny'd him; yet he gives not over; but retains &s;uch an high E&s;teem of God, as after all to apprehend there might yet be Room for Mercy, and therefore prays and cries unto Him &s;till.</P>
<P>In ver. 5, He repre&s;ents it as an <HI>Aggravation</HI> of his Affliction, that he was as one lying in the Grave, <HI>whom God remembers no more.</HI> The tho't of <HI>being re|membred by God no more,</HI> was very grievous to him&mdash; a plain Hint of his inward Piety, as apprehending <HI>God</HI>'s <HI>remembring him</HI> to be the only Scource of Happine&s;s and Comfort to him.</P>
<P>In ver. 6, <HI>Thou ha&s;t laid me in the lowe&s;t Pit, in Darkne&s;s, in the Deeps.</HI> Wherein he piou&s;ly ex|pre&s;&s;es his Faith in the <HI>&s;pecial Providence of God,</HI> and a&s;cribes his Mi&s;ery and Darkne&s;s to his Hand &amp; Will.</P>
<P>In ver. 7, <HI>Thy Wrath lyeth hard upon me; and thou ha&s;t afflicted me with all thy Waves.</HI> It was not meerly his <HI>Affliction,</HI> but his Apprehen&s;ion of the <HI>Wrath of God</HI> as the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing <HI>Weight</HI> or <HI>Sting</HI> of his Affliction, which chiefly grieved him, as it does the truly pious: He feels his Troubles as the overwhelm|ing Waves of God's Di&s;plea&s;ure, as the Pious in &s;uch Ca&s;es do: And his Apprehen&s;ion of the <HI>Wrath of God,</HI> implies a <HI>deep Sen&s;e</HI> of the <HI>greatne&s;s of his Sins,</HI> for which alone the Wrath of God could be excited.</P>
<P>In ver. 8, <HI>Thou ha&s;t put away mine Acquaintance from me: Thou ha&s;t made me an Abomination to them.</HI> Where his Faith in the <HI>&s;pecial Hand and Providence of God,</HI> is again expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>In ver. 9, <HI>Lord I have called upon Thee: I have &s;tretched out my Hand unto Thee!</HI> His pa&s;t Faith in God, with his importunate Applications to him, and his pre&s;ent eying Him are again repeated.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="007769_0009_102E793C7232A988">In ver. 10. 11. 12. He repre&s;ents his Ca&s;e to be &s;o deplorable, that his Salvation &s;eem'd exceeding difficult and unlikely.&mdash;<HI>Wilt thou &s;hew Wonders to the Dead? Shall the Dead ari&s;e and prai&s;e Thee? Shall thy Loving-kindne&s;s be declared in the Grave; or thy Faithfulne&s;s in De&s;truction? Shall thy Wonders be known in the Dark; and thy Righteou&s;ne&s;s in the Land of Forgetfulne&s;s?</HI> And yet in ver. 13, <HI>But unto Thee have I cried, O Lord; and in the Morning &s;hall my Prayer prevent</HI> [or come before] <HI>Thee!</HI> Tho' he had a long while, even from his Youth, 'tis likely for <HI>fifty Years,</HI> and Times innumerable, cried to God, and had not to his Apprehen&s;ion at lea&s;t, &s;uc|ceeded; yet he would not give up intirely; but re|&s;olves he will proceed, and early, every Day, and ear|ne&s;tly implore Him &s;till for Mercy.</P>
<P>Yea, in ver. 14, <HI>Lord, why ca&s;te&s;t thou off my Soul? Why hide&s;t thou thy Face from me?</HI> It is <HI>God's ca&s;t|eth off his precious Soul,</HI> that he is chiefly concerned for; and 'tis <HI>the Hiding of God's Face from him,</HI> that greatly grieves him. The&s;e are va&s;tly more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to him, as they are to gracious Souls, than any bodily or earthly Troubles. His great Concern, excites his &s;olicitous Enquiries to know of God <HI>the &s;pecial Rea&s;ons</HI> why a God of &s;uch unbounded Grace and Mercy, &s;hould ca&s;t him off, and hide his Face, notwith&s;tanding all his long, earne&s;t and innumerable Cries: and he plainly intimates, that he apprehended, if God would not ca&s;t him off nor hide his Face, but accept him and &s;hine upon him; O, this is That, and nothing &s;hort of This would give him Joy and Satisfaction.</P>
<P>All the&s;e, even in the Mid&s;t and Depth of his great|e&s;t Darkne&s;s, are the plain Outbreakings of that in|ward Faith and Piety, which lay at the Bottom of his Heart, and were the very Scource of his mo&s;t bitter Complaints and Cries.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="007769_0010_102E793F5E83F360">And indeed&punc; tho' I have heard many a Child of God, repre&s;enting their mi&s;erably dark, blind, de&s;erted, lo&s;t, undone, and peri&s;hing Condition; yet they cannot po&s;&s;ibly expre&s;s it, without expre&s;&s;ing <HI>&s;omething</HI> of <HI>that inward Faith and Piety</HI> lying deep in their Hearts, which they cannot &s;ee, and yet are the very Springs of their Di&s;tre&s;s and Cries.</P>
<P>To hear <HI>afflicted Souls</HI> complaining of Blindne&s;s of Mind, of Hardne&s;s of Heart, of Stupidity, of Unbe|lief, of Unfaithfulne&s;s, Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s, Ingratitude, Vilene&s;s, Folly, Madne&s;s, the Hidings of God's Face, or his for&s;aking them; yea crying out&mdash; <HI>O the&s;e cur&s;ed Hearts of ours!</HI> &amp;c. &mdash; It is indeed grievous to the tender Sympathizer: But O methinks I cannot help being inwardly pleas'd and glad, on &s;ome Accounts, to hear &s;uch Complaints as the&s;e: For methinks I plainly &s;ee &s;ome hopeful Symptoms of the <HI>&s;pecial Grace</HI> of Chri&s;t therein: Methinks I &s;ee that Sin, even in its Fountain, Power, and corrupting Influence, is burthen|&s;ome&mdash;Alienation from God is grievous&mdash;that Confor|mity to him in Holine&s;s, Obedience and Submi&s;&s;ion, is de&s;irable to them &mdash;that they have right Apprehen&s;ions of God and Chri&s;t, and the World, as a Portion or Hap|pine&s;s&mdash;and that they cannot be ea&s;y without the Image of God, without the Favour of God in Chri&s;t, without the Manife&s;tation of it, without their being agreable to Him in their Hearts and Lives thro' Chri&s;t, without their glorifying Him in every Thing, and enjoying Com|munion with Him.</P>
<P>And &s;uch a One was <HI>Heman</HI> in all his Darkne&s;s and Perplexities.</P>

<P>And 'tis highly probable, that in the my&s;terious Depths of Wi&s;dom, they were permitted to worry <HI>He|man,</HI>

even from his Youthful Days to his advanced Age. They might worry him both by horrible Temp|tations and Sugge&s;tions, and then by &s;etting the Terrors of God before his Mind, even to Di&s;traction. They might pervert every Scripture which otherwi&s;e would mini&s;ter Encouragement and Comfort; repre&s;ent Sin as Duty, and Duty as Sin; and give &s;uch horrible and &s;hocking Ideas of God and of him&s;elf; and then &s;uch terrible Ideas of the Holine&s;s and Maje&s;ty of God again, as he could not tell how to bear, and yet hold him under them, till they in a great Degree di&s;tracted him.</P>

<P>The pious <HI>A&s;aph,</HI> who &s;tood at <HI>Heman</HI>'s Right Hand, as <HI>Ethan</HI> at his Left, when &s;inging before the Ark, and in the Tabernacle, was not only well acquainted with the afflicted Ca&s;e of his Companion <HI>Heman;</HI> but was al&s;o <HI>much</HI> in the <HI>&s;ame Condition,</HI> and for a while much perplexed with this my&s;terious Di&s;pen&s;ation: 'till at length he went into the Sanctuary; and There he &s;aw <HI>&s;ome</HI> of the <HI>Rea&s;ons</HI> to his entire Satisfaction; as he plainly tells us in the <HI>&s;eventy third</HI> PSALM.</P>
<P>And I &s;hall here briefly hint not only <HI>Tho&s;e,</HI> but by the Light of Revelation <HI>&s;ome others</HI> al&s;o.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> might be to give to him, and by him to others, more reverential Apprehen&s;ions of the <HI>Being</HI> and <HI>Nature</HI> of <HI>GOD;</HI> of his glorious Perfections, Providence and Word; of his Authority and Laws; of his Promi&s;es and Threatnings, of his faithful Fulfilment of them; and of his

adorable Sovereignty and Maje&s;ty; to make them more afraid of Hypocri&s;y, Formality and trifling with him; and to excite &amp; keep alive their more &s;olemn &amp; con&s;tant Awe of his continual Pre&s;ence &amp; the future Judgment.</P>
<P><HI>Another Rea&s;on</HI> may be to &s;how the exceeding evil <HI>Nature</HI> and mi&s;chievous <HI>Influence</HI> and <HI>Con&s;equence</HI> of <HI>Sin,</HI> the fruitful Scource of all Darkne&s;s, Horror, Affliction and Di&s;tre&s;s, with the terrible Re&s;entment of GOD again&s;t it: that he is infinitely di&s;plea&s;ed with it, even in his deare&s;t People; yea, when it lay on the <HI>Body</HI> and <HI>Soul</HI> of the <HI>Man</HI> CHRIST JESUS by <HI>Imputation,</HI> or by <HI>Sub&s;titution</HI> only.</P>
<P><HI>Another Rea&s;on</HI> may be to &s;how, that tho' he <HI>par|dons</HI> and <HI>dearly loves,</HI> yet <HI>in the pre&s;ent State,</HI> he <HI>grievou&s;ly cha&s;ti&s;es;</HI> that all de&s;erve the like Affliction, are alike expo&s;ed to it, and are entirely obliged to the &s;overeign Will of God, that they are not con&s;tantly en|during the &s;ame Di&s;tre&s;&s;es; and &s;o excite their greater Thankfulne&s;s to their divine Pre&s;erver.</P>
<P><HI>Another Rea&s;on</HI> might be, to excite in <HI>Heman</HI> and <HI>others,</HI> a greater <HI>Hatred</HI> of <HI>Sin,</HI> Alienation from it, Enmity to it; Solicitude for Purification, Pardon, the Favour of God in Chri&s;t, with the holy, &s;enb&s;ile and happy Manife&s;tation and Influence thereof.</P>
<P><HI>Another Rea&s;on</HI> might be to make the <HI>Body of Sin</HI> more burthen&s;ome to <HI>Heman</HI> and <HI>other Saints;</HI> and excite their earne&s;t Groanings, Longings, Prayers and Endeavours after progre&s;&s;ive &amp; compleat Deliverance.</P>

<P><HI>Another Rea&s;on</HI> may be to make <HI>Others</HI> more afraid of <HI>Sin;</HI> to excite the <HI>Impenitent</HI> to &s;peedy and true Repentance; to excite the <HI>Penitent</HI> to a greater Cau|tion as well as clearer Evidence of their own Sincerity.</P>

Glory of the Ju&s;tice, Holine&s;s and Power of God, in their aggravated Puni&s;hment.</P>

<P>And <HI>whatever other Rea&s;ons</HI> there may be of this my&s;terious Di&s;pen&s;ation, <HI>they</HI> and <HI>others</HI> &s;hall <HI>clearly &s;ee in the Light of Heaven;</HI> where the SON of GOD who <HI>opens</HI> the <HI>Books</HI> of the divine Contrivances, will <HI>&s;how</HI> &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to all the happy Multitudes about Him, the con&s;ummate Wi&s;dom of all his Works, to their perfect Satisfaction, and their highe&s;t Wonder and Joy for ever.</P>
<P>And thus have we taken a tran&s;ient View of <HI>the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Ca&s;e</HI> of <HI>Heman,</HI> and of many other pious Per&s;ons in the like Condition.</P>
<P>We now come to &s;ome IMPROVEMENT.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="007769_0028_102E7975F34C2BF0">And,</P>
<P N="1">1. Here we &s;ee in <HI>Heman</HI> a <HI>remarkable In&s;tance</HI> of the adorable <HI>Sovereignty</HI> of GOD in his my&s;terious Di&s;pen&s;ations towards a Per&s;on of Piety, yea of emi|nent Piety.</P>
<P>By <HI>Sovereignty</HI> I do not mean &s;uch a Sovereignty as is again&s;t the Glory either of his Wi&s;dom, Ju&s;tice, Ho|ne&s;s, Truth, Goodne&s;s, or any of the Divine Perfections in the winding up of all his Di&s;pen&s;ations: For this is utterly incon&s;i&s;tent and impo&s;&s;ible: but &s;uch a <HI>Sove|reignty</HI> as does not make <HI>our proportionable De&s;ervings</HI> the Rule of his Di&s;pen&s;ations towards us in the <HI>pre&s;ent State;</HI> (which was the grand Mi&s;take of JOB'S <HI>Three Friends</HI>) but may order <HI>more grievous Trials</HI> for <HI>holy Per&s;ons</HI> than for <HI>Others;</HI> yea for Per&s;ons of <HI>higher</HI> Degrees of Holine&s;s than <HI>lower;</HI> tho' not more grie|vous than they all de&s;erve: for in the mid&s;t of all, the whole World mu&s;t own, He in the <HI>pre&s;ent State</HI> afflicts them inconceivably le&s;s than their Sins de&s;erve.</P>

<P N="3">3. Then we may by no Means &s;uppo&s;e that &s;uch as have been <HI>thus afflicted and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed,</HI> were not truly pious, or le&s;s pious than others, or were guilty of greater Sins than others, or de&s;erved thus to be treated more than others.</P>

<P>As he was of a <HI>Publick Spirit,</HI> and lov'd <HI>the Town,</HI> they greatly affected <HI>Him</HI> &mdash; Cho&s;e him <HI>one</HI> of their <HI>Select-Men</HI> to take Care of their Intere&s;ts, in 1731, and &s;o for <HI>four Years</HI> running&mdash;then in 1735, <HI>an Over|&s;eer of their Poor,</HI> for <HI>four Years more</HI> &mdash; and then in 1739, <HI>their Repre&s;entative</HI> in the <HI>General Court</HI> of the <HI>Province</HI> for <HI>four Years more</HI>&mdash;and would fain have continued to chu&s;e him in that important Tru&s;t: But he found the weighty Care of his Country in &s;o Pub|lick a Place too heavy for his tender Heart and Con|&s;titution, entreated them not to chu&s;e him again, and could not be per&s;waded to bear it longer; tho' in the happy Company of his mo&s;t agreable Brother-in-Law the late Hon. <HI>Thomas Cu&s;hing,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> a Fellow-Member with him, for whom He as well as many others had a very high E&s;teem and very dear Affection; and tho' in the faire&s;t Way of the highe&s;t Honours his Country could rai&s;e him to. But prefering the quieter Office of <HI>taking Care of the Poor,</HI> the Town continued him therein from his <HI>fir&s;t Election,</HI> for <HI>twenty one Years</HI> &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, to the Day of his Death. And in every Office approval him&s;elf with Uprightne&s;s and Faith|fulne&s;s.</P>
<P>He greatly loved the <HI>mo&s;t zealous, &s;earching</HI> and <HI>awakning Mini&s;ters:</HI> and they were always heartily welcome to his Hou&s;e and Table.</P>
<P>He &s;teadily kept up Religion and good Order in his <HI>Family,</HI> both on the <HI>&s;acred Sabbaths</HI> and <HI>other Days:</HI>

In perfect Harmony with his virtuous <HI>Con&s;ort,</HI> trained up his <HI>Children</HI> in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord. Among the Re&s;t &mdash; <HI>That mo&s;t hopeful Youth</HI> his elde&s;t Son <HI>of his own Name,</HI> whom he had bro't up to Learning for Publick Service, and proved one of the mo&s;t ingenious and pious Youths this Country ever bred: but on <HI>Aug.</HI> 18. 1746, was, to the exceeding Grief of his <HI>Parents,</HI> and the great Lo&s;s and Sorrow of <HI>Others,</HI> &s;natched from us by a violent Fever, in the 23d Year of his Age. Who&s;e Death fell &s;o much the hea|vier on his di&s;tre&s;&s;ed <HI>Father</HI> by Rea&s;on of his tender Con&s;titution, and the grievous Lo&s;s of his dear Brother <HI>Cu&s;hing</HI> on <HI>April</HI> 11, preceeding: And both the&s;e Lo&s;&s;es made his Wounds of Grief &s;o deep, that he ne|ver &s;eem'd to recover wholly from them.</P>
<P>But all who intimately knew him, could not but ap|prehend he maintained a clo&s;e Walk with God continu|ally. And yet he &s;aw &s;o much Deficiency and Cor|ruption in him&s;elf, and was &s;o dreadfully worried with <HI>horrible Sugge&s;tions</HI> and <HI>Temptations;</HI> that tho' he <HI>feared the Lord,</HI> yet he almo&s;t always <HI>walked in Dark|ne&s;s &amp; could &s;ee no Light</HI>&mdash;was like <HI>Heman</HI> much afflicted with Soul-Perplexities, even from his Youth; and as he advanc'd in Age they &s;eem'd, e&s;pecially of late, to grow, till <HI>the Terrors of GOD</HI> at Times in &s;ome De|gree di&s;tracted him.</P>
<P>O how often have I heard him cry out in a mo&s;t do|lorous Manner, thro' horrible Sugge&s;tions and Temp|tations concerning <HI>The Holy God,</HI> as with Solemnity he would always call him. As <HI>David</HI> he might &s;ay to GOD, &amp; tis likely many Times hath &s;aid as in <HI>P&s;al.</HI> xxxii. 3, 4. <HI>My Bones wax old thro' my Roaring all the Day long: For Day and Night thy Hand is heavy upon me: My Moi&s;ture is turned into the Drought of Summer.</HI> Or as in <HI>P&s;al.</HI> xxxviii. 8. <HI>I am feeble and

<P>Yet in all his di&s;tracting Darkne&s;s he ever <HI>ju&s;tified</HI> the HOLY GOD: He continually expre&s;s'd his <HI>reverential Apprehen&s;ions</HI> of him: and even while his intellectual Powers were &s;o greatly clouded and di&s;ordered, we could hear <HI>no Murmurings</HI> again&s;t him, but <HI>earne&s;t Cryings</HI> to him thro' Chri&s;t for Mercy, while he condemned him|&s;elf as utterly unworthy of it. His <HI>Complaints</HI> were <HI>only</HI> of the <HI>horrible Sugge&s;tions</HI> of <HI>Satan</HI> again&s;t the ble&s;|&s;ed GOD, and the <HI>vile Corruptions of his own Heart,</HI> with <HI>di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Fears</HI> of <HI>yielding</HI> to tho&s;e <HI>Sugge&s;tions,</HI> and of <HI>&s;inning</HI> even in <HI>the &s;malle&s;t Matters.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>few Days</HI> before he <HI>died,</HI> he &s;eem'd in a great Mea&s;ure to be relieved of them, and to grow <HI>more compos'd and quiet.</HI> But as Death approached, his Intellectuals failed, and hindered us from knowing his final Sentiments. Yet we cannot but be fully per|&s;waded, that his departing Spirit, with Amazement on a &s;udden opened into glorious Light and Holine&s;s, and Liberty, and Joy and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s.</P>
<P>O let the bereaved <HI>Widow</HI> repair to her REDEEMER, as her All-&s;ufficient and ever-living Husband.

<P>AFter &s;everal Weeks Langui&s;hment died on the 10th, and this Day was decently inter'd, Mr. EDWARD BROM|FIELD, an eminent Merchant in this Place.&mdash;His An|ce&s;tors, were among the di&s;tingui&s;h'd Worthies of NEW-ENGLAND, who&s;e Names will appear in Characters of Honour, in the <HI>Annals</HI> of our <HI>Church</HI> &amp; <HI>State.</HI>&mdash;The Grace of God took early Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Heart, and under its happy Influence, he devoted tho&s;e Years to the Service of Heaven, which are too generally &s;pent in the Vanities of Life. &mdash; The <HI>Town</HI> of BOSTON, his native Place, ob&s;erv'd his Accom|pli&s;hments, and call'd him to fill &s;ome of their mo&s;t im|portant Places of Tru&s;t: All which he di&s;charg'd, with great Honour to him&s;elf, and Advantage to the Publick.&mdash; In the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, he appear'd the firm, uncorrupted Patriot; careful to a&s;&s;ert the ju&s;t Prerogative of the Crown, and to defend the invaluable Liberties of the People. He has been con&s;tantly cho&s;en, for many Years, one of the Select-Men of the Town, and an Over|ver&s;eer of the Poor: which honourable Offices he exe|cuted with great Fidelity &mdash; to univer&s;al Approbation. Attentive to the Complaints of the indigent,&mdash;diligent to maintain the good Order and publick Vertue of the In|habitants.&mdash;Firmly attach'd to the RELIGION OF JESUS, he received its &s;ublime&s;t My&s;teries, with the humble&s;t Reverence&mdash;obeyed its Precepts with uniform Exactne&s;s&mdash; cheri&s;h'd its Mini&s;ters with affectionate tenderne&s;s&mdash; and &s;ought its Advancement with unremitting A&s;&s;iduity. &mdash; Tho' zealous for the <HI>Doctrine</HI> &amp; <HI>Con&s;titution</HI> of the <HI>Churches</HI>

of NEW-ENGLAND; yet with a truly catholick Charity he embraced good Men of every Denomination; Tho' &s;trict to the highe&s;t Degree in his own Conduct; he made the mo&s;t charitable Allowance for the Infirmities of others&mdash; In his Dome&s;tic Relations, he was a &s;hining Example of every Chri&s;tian Vertue. An affectionate <HI>Hu&s;band</HI>&mdash;a ten|der <HI>Father</HI>&mdash;an indulgent <HI>Ma&s;ter.</HI> His Hou&s;e was a little CHURCH, where every Thing that had the Appearance of Vice was re&s;olutely bani&s;h'd; the Exerci&s;es of De|votion were regularly perform'd; the Religion of the Sab|bath &s;trictly ob&s;erv'd: He took a con&s;cientious Care to promote the temporal, as well as &s;piritual Welfare, of all committed to his Charge.&mdash; His Con&s;titution was naturally tender; the Infirmities of his Body, &s;ometimes clouded the Serenity of his Mind, and indi&s;pos'd him for tho&s;e &s;piri|tual Joys, which many Chri&s;tians of lower Attainments happily experience. But under his growing Di&s;orders, he always maintain'd a devout and reverential <HI>Subjection to the Father of Spirits</HI>&mdash;an entire Dependence on the Merits of our divine Redeemer&mdash;and was above all Things &s;olli|citous, that he might glorify God in LIFE and DEATH.&mdash; His Removal is a great Lo&s;s to his Friends&mdash;his Family&mdash; and the Publick. But to him, we have the highe&s;t Rea&s;on to believe&mdash;<HI>The Day of his Death was better than the Day of his Birth.</HI></P>
