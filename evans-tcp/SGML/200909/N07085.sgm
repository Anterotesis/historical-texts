<P>And he died in a good old Age, full of Days, Riches, and Honor; and <HI>Solomon</HI> his Son reigned in his Stead.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_IN the&s;e Words, we have an Account of the re&s;pectable Circum&s;tances, with which <HI>David,</HI> the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> and <HI>Judah,</HI> concluded his u&s;eful Life and Reign.</P>
<P>IN di&s;cour&s;ing upon which, I &s;hall offer &s;ome Con&s;iderations re&s;pecting the <HI>Nature, Cau&s;e,</HI> and <HI>A&s;pect</HI> of <HI>Death,</HI> upon the pre&s;ent and future Life; tending to repe&s;ent its Solemnity, and the Nece&s;&s;ity and Importance of Preparation for it, and &s;o proceed to the Improvement.</P>
<P>DEATH is the <HI>Di&s;&s;olution</HI> of the <HI>Union</HI> between Soul and Body, upon which our animal Life depends, and tho' we have no Rea&s;on to conclude, that the Life of our Soul is hereby annihilated; yet if we con&s;ider human Nature as compounded of Soul and Body, Death may be, in &s;ome Sen&s;e, &s;aid to be the vi&s;ible De&s;truction of it, becau&s;e it reduces all of Man, that is vi&s;ible, to deplorable Ruins! Reduces the active Creature full of anxious Thoughts, big

with great Projects and De&s;igns, and laborious in the Pur&s;uit of them, to a breathle&s;s Ma&s;s, a gha&s;tly Spectacle, devoid of Beauty and of Motion, which to prevent being offen&s;ive, mu&s;t &s;oon be hid in the dark and &s;ilent Retreat of the Grave, and become the Prey of Worms.</P>
<P>HOW this vital <HI>Union</HI> is di&s;&s;olved, we know no more than how it is formed; that Beings of &s;o va&s;tly different Natures as the Soul and Body are, &s;hould be clo&s;ely united is amazing, yet the Union appears to be as certain as it is a&s;toni&s;hing, from their Sympathy with, and Influence upon each other.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time this is apparent, that Death in its near Approaches, generally offers Violence to the Frame of Nature; tho' in &s;ome In&s;tances, the Lamp of Life expires gently and gradually, like a Candle in the Socket; yet, in mo&s;t, human Nature does not yield to the la&s;t Enemy without Reluctance, which as it manife&s;ts its deep Aver&s;ion to Death, &s;o it proves Death to be the Shipwreck of Nature: Our vital Parts being torn by the Violence of Di&s;ea&s;es, as a Ve&s;&s;el by the Rage of a Tempe&s;t, before it &s;inks into the Aby&s;s of the Grave!</P>
<P>BUT whence is it that Death puts a Period to our pre&s;ent Exi&s;tence, &s;hall we a&s;cribe this entirely to the &s;overeign Plea&s;ure of the &s;upreme Being, which without any regard to our Demerit, has &s;ubjected our Nature to &s;uch Mortality and Corruption? No! the &s;acred Scriptures a&s;&s;ert Death to be a <HI>penal Evil,</HI> i&s;&s;uing not from the meer Sovereignty, but the Ju&s;tice and Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God.</P>
<P>THO' Immortality was no Privilege that innocent Man could claim, by the original Right of his Nature; yet it was graciou&s;ly promi&s;ed as the Reward of his Obedience: It is
<PB N="7" REF="009023_0005_1030749EC0DC69C8">
true, the human Body was formed of the Du&s;t, and that this is not &s;o adapted to an immortal Life as the Soul, and therefore could only obtain and enjoy it by way of Gratuity, thro' the powerful Agency of a particular Providence.</P>
<P>THE Almighty to excite Man to Obedience, promi&s;ed this &s;upernatural Privilege, and to deter him from the Contrary, threatened Death as the Puni&s;hment of Sin: Which nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es, that it would not have been his Lot, had he per&s;i&s;ted in his Obedience to his Creator and Sovereign: And hence the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, that <HI>The Wages of Sin is Death;</HI> and el&s;ewhere, that <HI>By one Man Sin entered into the World, and Death by Sin, and &s;o Death pa&s;&s;ed upon all Men, for that all had SINNED:</HI> How? Virtually, in their federal Head the fir&s;t <HI>Adam;</HI> it was therefore at this Door, that Death and all its preceeding Train of Di&s;ea&s;es and Mi&s;eries, has broke in upon and entirely inundated this lower World, whereby it is rendered a Vale of Tears, a Scene of Woe: And indeed it is congruous both to Rea&s;on and Ju&s;tice, that the Empire of Death and Mi&s;ery &s;hould be parallel in Extent with the Dominion of Sin, the one as univer&s;al as the other.</P>
<P>BUT what <HI>A&s;pect</HI> has this penal Evil, Death, upon the pre&s;ent Life? I an&s;wer, It may be &s;aid in general to be the End of it, it puts a final Period to the Drama of Life, whereby its &s;hifting Scenes are quite &s;hut up, and the Actors hurried off the Stage into a State of Inactivity and Darkne&s;s, ju&s;t as in the dead of the Night, an entire &s;top is put to all the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the preceeding Day, and every Place of public Concour&s;e wrapt up in &s;olemn Silence and Ob&s;curity!</P>
<P>BUT in particular, Death puts a Period to all our worldly <HI>Schemes</HI> and <HI>Labours,</HI> as well as to our <HI>&s;ecular</HI> State of <HI>Pro&s;perity</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="009023_0006_103074A245E22A20">
and <HI>Adver&s;ity,</HI> together with the Sea&s;ons of <HI>Grace,</HI> and Opportunities of <HI>Service.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT is &s;aid of <HI>Princes</HI> may be applied to <HI>Pea&s;ants,</HI> that <HI>Their Breath goeth out, and in that very Day their Thoughts peri&s;h:</HI> While the <HI>State&s;man</HI> is forming grand Projects, and imagines he has near compa&s;&s;ed his De&s;igns; Death, which con&s;tantly lies in Ambu&s;h, frequently, and &s;uddenly cru&s;hes his Schemes, di&s;appoints his Expectations, and bla&s;ts his Succe&s;s: Death carries all off from the Theatre of Action, to the Pri&s;on of the Grave, where tho&s;e, that a little while before, made a great Noi&s;e and Bu&s;tle, are locked up in a profound Sleep, out of which Nothing can awake them, but the loud Bla&s;t of the Archangel's Trumpet.</P>
<P>DEATH likewi&s;e puts a Period to our outward State, whether pro&s;perous or afflicted; it concludes Pro&s;perity by de&s;troying Life, the Foundation of it, and hurries the grande&s;t Potentates, from the Pomp of a Throne, to the Ob&s;curity of the Grave, where no Traces of their former Grandeur appear, in the gha&s;tly Remains of their Mortality, and the Places that knew them on Earth &s;hall know them no more.</P>
<P>ON the other Hand, Death concludes all the Evils of an afflicted State, this gives the Child of God a happy Di&s;charge from all the Hard&s;hips of the Chri&s;tian Warfare, and brings to a Period the Cruelty of Enemies, who&s;e Rage can pur&s;ue us no further than the Grave, <HI>There the Wicked cea&s;e from troubling, and the Weary are at Re&s;t:</HI> In a Word, Death is a &s;ecure Retreat from all the Calamities of Life, under the Pre&s;&s;ure of which the whole Creation groans and travels, and is therefore on this Account as acceptable to many, as the Darkne&s;s of the Night to the wearied Hireling!</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="009023_0007_103074A4064047E0">BUT this is not all, Death likewi&s;e puts a final Period to all our Opportunities of Service; we have now many Advantages to do Good, and mu&s;t account for our Diligence and Fidelity in the Improvement of them; but the&s;e will &s;oon be over. Death will, in a little Time, bring every one of us that awful Me&s;&s;age, <HI>Give an Account of thy Steward&s;hip, for thou mayest be no longer Steward.</HI></P>
<P>BUT I proceed to con&s;ider the A&s;pect that Death has upon a <HI>future Life.</HI></P>
<P>HERE ob&s;erve, That by Death our Souls are brought to live in a State of Separation from our Bodies, tho' <HI>the Dust returns to</HI> its original <HI>Earth,</HI> yet our <HI>Spirits return to God who gave them.</HI> They become, by quitting the&s;e Man&s;ions, unembodied Spirits, and enter upon a new Scene of Life, in which they have no U&s;e for the Organs of Sen&s;e and Motion; Death liberates our Souls from the Incumbrance of elementary Bodies, and thereby awakes their noble Powers to greater Vigor and Sublimity in their Operations; it frees our Spirits from their Dependance on animal Bodies, and from the Impre&s;&s;ions made on them by &s;en&s;ible Objects, &s;o that the Plea&s;ures thence i&s;&s;uing for ever terminate, and are now derived from Objects better &s;uited to the immaterial Nature of the Soul. Further,</P>
<P>BY Death our Souls enter into an un&s;een World, and change their Place as well as their Mode of living, we pa&s;s by Death into the va&s;t HADES, or invi&s;ible World; to us an undi&s;covered and untried Country, which neither our Sen&s;es can give us any Notice of, or our Rea&s;on comprehend; and in which we &s;hall meet with new Society, and &s;uch a va&s;t Variety of new Objects and Entertainments, either in them&s;elves, or in Re&s;pect
<PB N="10" REF="009023_0008_103074AA7136F7F0">
of our <HI>Apprehen&s;ion</HI> of them; (then immediate and perfect) as will furni&s;h a &s;ufficient Fund for everla&s;ting Wonder, Love, and Prai&s;e! When our Spirits pa&s;s out of the narrow Current of Time, they leave this minute Point of Earth on which we tread, and take their Flight into tho&s;e immen&s;e Territories, over which he pre&s;ides who has the Keys of Hell and Death.</P>
<P>FURTHER, our Souls pa&s;s from a State of Tryal to a State of Rewards and Puni&s;hments, as incomprehen&s;ible as excellent, &s;atisfactory, eternal; Rewards which the human Mind in its &s;ublime&s;t Flights cannot gra&s;p, and which all Language and Images fail adequately to expre&s;s.</P>
<P>THO' the general Judgment be deferred till the Re&s;urrection, yet the Soul undergoes a particular Judgment, immediately after its Departure from the Body, or &s;omething analogous to it, which is previou&s;ly nece&s;&s;ary to its being fixed in a State of Bli&s;s or Mi&s;ery; and this the &s;acred Scriptures a&s;&s;ure us is the Ca&s;e of all that depart this Life, as appears by the Parable of <HI>Dives</HI> and <HI>Lazarus,</HI> the Promi&s;e of Chri&s;t to the Thief on the Cro&s;s, and the De&s;ire of the Apo&s;tle to be di&s;&s;olved, that he might be with Je&s;us.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Improvement</HI> of this Subject now calls for your Attention.</P>
<P>DOES DEATH bring &s;uch vi&s;ible Ruin upon our Nature, and is it the penal Fruit of Sin? Then what Rea&s;on has any Man living to be proud, who con&s;tantly carries about with him &s;uch poignant Incentives to Humility, in the Mortality of his very Frame, which has in it the Seeds of innumerable Di&s;ea&s;es, and of Death: Should he boa&s;t of his De&s;cent who mu&s;t <HI>&s;ay of Corruption thou art my Father, and to the Worm thou art my Mother and my Sister.</HI>&mdash;Shall we glory in our Strength
<PB N="11" REF="009023_0009_103074AC842C8310">
which is cru&s;hed before the Moth?&mdash;Or in our Beauty, who&s;e Features &s;hall put on a gha&s;tly Pale, and be &s;tained with Putrefaction?&mdash;Shall we be puffed up with Wealth and Honor who mu&s;t &s;o &s;oon leave them, and &s;ink in undi&s;tingui&s;hed Du&s;t and deep Oblivion?&mdash;And &s;eeing Sin has intailed this Cur&s;e of Mortality upon us, we may thence infer its great Malignity, and &s;hould be thereby enduced to behave towards it accordingly, as the mo&s;t odious Deformity and fatal Source of all our Woes!</P>
<P>IS the Empire of Death ab&s;olute and univer&s;al? Then how little is Man to be tru&s;ted in, who&s;e Breath is in his No&s;trils, continually expo&s;ed to innumerable Accidents? <HI>Surely Men of low Condition are Vanity, and Men of high Degree a Lye:</HI> Who may by corrupt Bia&s;es, incon&s;tant Re&s;olutions, or by &s;udden Death, di&s;appoint our Expectations from them; if any de&s;erved our Confidence, it would be the great and powerful, but even tho&s;e we are cautioned again&s;t a Dependance on: <HI>Trust not in Princes, nor in the Son of Man, in whom there is no Help, his Breath goeth out, he returns to his Earth; in that very Day his Thoughts peri&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>DOES Death put a Period to all our &s;ecular Affairs, then how moderate &s;hould we be in the Pro&s;ecution of them, inviolably ob&s;erving the rational and excellent Medium between Extreams, pre&s;cribed by the Apo&s;tle, <HI>Sorrowing as tho' we &s;orrowed not, and rejoicing as tho' we rejoiced not, becau&s;e the Fa&s;hion of this World pa&s;&s;eth away.</HI> Death &s;trips the World of its deceitful Charms, and repre&s;ents it in its native Dre&s;s of Emptine&s;s and Vanity; The Grave &s;ets before our Eyes in a &s;trong Point of Light, of how little Significancy human Greatne&s;s and Pro&s;perity are, to tho&s;e who mu&s;t in a &s;hort Space leave them all behind, and go as naked out of the World
<PB N="12" REF="009023_0010_103074AE40755710">
as they came into it: Certainly covetous Per&s;ons that make a great Noi&s;e and Bu&s;tle about their Projects and De&s;igns, <HI>Spend their Money for that which is not Bread, walk in a vain Shew, and vex them&s;elves in vain.</HI></P>
<P>WILL Death put a final Period to all the Sufferings of this Life and that to come, with Re&s;pect to &s;uch as fear God and work Righteou&s;ne&s;s? Then let us endure them with Patience and Fortitude, for they are <HI>light, and but for a Moment, and therefore not worthy to be compared with the exceeding great and eternal Weight of Glory before us!</HI> Death will &s;end our pained Bodies to the Dormitory of the Grave, and in Ca&s;e we truely repent of Sin, and believe in Je&s;us, tran&s;late our afflicted Souls to the Re&s;t of God, where all Tears &s;hall be wiped away, and we &s;hall enjoy a Felicity, large as our De&s;ires, and la&s;ting as our Souls.</P>
<P>AND &s;eeing Death concludes our gracious Sea&s;ons, and Opportunities of Service, let us <HI>awake out of Sleep,</HI> and <HI>work while the Day lasts, for the Night cometh in which no Man can work.</HI></P>
<P>BUT I proceed to &s;peak a little on the melancholy Occa&s;ion of this Di&s;cour&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Death</HI> of our late gracious <HI>Soverign, King GEORGE</HI> the <HI>Second,</HI> of happy Memory; a Prince who may be in Ju&s;tice denominated, the <HI>Father</HI> of his People: A Prince who thro' the whole Cour&s;e of his Reign aimed at no de&s;potic tyrannical Sway, but on the Contrary expre&s;&s;ed due Re&s;pect to the repre&s;entative Body of the Nation, and made its Laws and Con&s;titution the invariable Rule of his Conduct: As he wronged no Man of his private <HI>Property,</HI> &s;o he granted to all that religious <HI>Liberty;</HI> which, as it is the Birth-right of all, &s;o it is the greate&s;t Support and Ornament
<PB N="13" REF="009023_0011_103074B014D69C28">
of real Chri&s;tianity, which is a rea&s;onable Service, founded on Argument, the I&s;&s;ue of impartial Enquiry and free Choice: But the Rever&s;e hereof, is built on the Ruins of every Thing that is valuable in human Nature, and directly tends to de&s;troy the Religion of Je&s;us entirely, by &s;etting up other Kings in his &s;piritual Kingdom, and claiming Allegiance to them in Oppo&s;ition to his Authority: In brief, it oppo&s;es Humanity and en&s;laves Mankind.</P>
<P>HERE give me Leave tran&s;iently to ob&s;erve, That there was a memorable Re&s;emblance or Analogy between the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Monarch <HI>David,</HI> and our decea&s;ed Sovereign, in Re&s;pect of his heroic military Character, as appears particularly from the intrepid Bravery of the latter at the famous Battle of DETTINGEN, the I&s;&s;ue of which reflected as great Glory on the Arms of <HI>Britain,</HI> as it did Scandal on tho&s;e of <HI>France!</HI></P>
<P>AS the Pro&s;perity of his People was the principal Object of his Attention, &s;o he was anxious and unwearied in the Pro&s;ecution of it to the la&s;t Moments of his Life; and hence the Nation's E&s;teem and Love encrea&s;ed with his growing Years, which is not only evident from their public Declarations, but likewi&s;e by their extraordinary <HI>Union</HI> among them&s;elves; and, that even under the prodigious Load of an expen&s;ive War, the great Variety of their Denominations, religious Principles, and Party Views notwith&s;tanding.</P>
<P>IN Con&s;equence of the afore&s;aid <HI>Union,</HI> it plea&s;ed that divine Providence, by which Kings reign, and Princes decree Ju&s;tice, to crown the latter Part of the Admini&s;tration of our decea&s;ed Sovereign with &s;uch an a&s;toni&s;hing Train of memorable Victories by Land and Sea, as will be the Wonder of Po&s;terity,
<PB N="14" REF="009023_0012_103074B32144C8E0">
and brighten the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Annals in all future Time: As this illu&s;trious Aera reflects great Honor on the King, his Councils, and Arms, &s;o if rightly improved, it opens, under Providence, a Pro&s;pect of EMPIRE for the Nation, beyond what the mo&s;t &s;anguine Hopes would have &s;ometime &s;ince dared to dictate; an Empire that will give her va&s;tly more Weight in the Scale of <HI>Europe,</HI> if not (in a Cour&s;e of Time) con&s;titute her the Arbitre&s;s of it.</P>
<P>BUT in the mid&s;t of this &s;urprizing Series of the mo&s;t important Events, in this critical Conjuncture of a War with numerous and potent Nations, combined in an unju&s;t, extraordinary and formidable Confederacy, to ruin entirely a Prote&s;tant Prince, and one of the mo&s;t renowned, intrepid, and invincible <HI>Heroes</HI> that the pre&s;ent or any pa&s;t Age has produced; I mean his <HI>Pru&s;&s;ian Majesty:</HI> In this Situation of Things our &s;ucce&s;sful Monarch dies, dies &s;uddenly, while beloved and revered, dies the De&s;ire and Delight of his People; while <HI>France,</HI> our artful implacable Enemy, who has &s;o long in&s;ulted the Honor, en&s;nared the Councils, and meditated the Ruin of our Nation: I &s;ay, while this arogant Rival-Power is exceedingly humbled, and almo&s;t brought to Rea&s;on, while <HI>France</HI> is &s;tripped of many Fortre&s;&s;es and va&s;t Domains in divers Parts of the World, e&s;pecially in <HI>America</HI> and the <HI>East-Indies;</HI> her Fleet broken, and her Trade de&s;troyed, our beloved Sovereign dies, and leaves his great and good De&s;igns, in Re&s;pect of War and Peace, on which his Heart was &s;o much &s;et, unfini&s;hed: A melancholy Providence this! which &s;hould be laid to Heart, and rightly improved; let us there|fore humble our&s;elves under the mighty Hand of God, that he may exalt us in due Time; let us implore Heaven that this Event may be over-ruled to the Good of our NATION in particular, and of ZION in general: Let us be hereby &s;tirred
<PB N="15" REF="009023_0013_103074B713D1DE28">
up to prepare for our own Di&s;&s;olution, which how near it is, and how &s;udden it may be, we know not; as <HI>Horace</HI> ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, Death makes no Di&s;tinction between the Cottages of Pea&s;ants and the Palaces of Princes:&mdash;And from hence let us likewi&s;e learn the extreme Vanity of all human Greatne&s;s and Dignity, which cannot &s;creen their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors from the Stroke of a &s;udden Death.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time give me Leave to ob&s;erve, that thro' divine Goodne&s;s, there are &s;ome Circum&s;tances attending this <HI>Gloom</HI> of Providence, which may allay our Griefs and animate our Hopes, e&s;pecially the&s;e following, <HI>viz.</HI> The MODE (or Circum&s;tances) of our late Sovereign's Exit, the Qualifications of his MINISTRY, the promi&s;ing Endowments of his SUCCESSOR, and the late famous VICTORY of the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> over the <HI>Austrian</HI> Army.</P>
<P>THE Circum&s;tances of our late Sovereign's Exit were re&s;pectable, &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Hero in our Text, particularly, he died in a good old Age, full of Days, being arrived to his Seventy-&s;eventh Year, after a Reign of Thirty-three, very near the &s;ame Space that <HI>David</HI> reigned over <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> it is but a &s;mall Number of Mankind of any Order that live to &s;uch an Age, and very few Princes in any Part of the World reign &s;o long a Space.
