<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_MR. THOMAS HOOKER was one of the mo&s;t e&s;teemed Divines in <HI>England, Holland,</HI> and <HI>New-Eng|land,</HI> in his Day; for great Abili|ties, a piercing Judgment, &s;olid Learning, ex|traordinary Sanctity, deep Acquaintance with the Scriptures and experimental Divinity, and for awakening and &s;ucce&s;sful Preach|ing: And his Name and Writings were very dear to Multitudes of the mo&s;t &s;erious Chri&s;|tians in tho&s;e di&s;tant Countries.</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Cotton Mather</HI> tells us, &mdash;That <Q>He was born at <HI>Marfield,</HI> in <HI>Lice&s;ter&s;hire</HI> in ENGLAND, about the Year 1586. His natural Temper was chearful and courteous; but accompanied with &s;uch a &s;en&s;ible <HI>Grandeur of Mind,</HI> as caus'd his Friends to progno&s;ticate that he was born to be <HI>con&s;iderable:</HI> His Parents gave him a liberal Education, and &s;ent him to <HI>Cambridge;</HI> where he was cho&s;e a <HI>Proctor</HI> of the <HI>Univer&s;ity,</HI> [who&s;e <HI>Office</HI> is to &s;ee good Orders and Exerci&s;es duely performed there.] where the Influ|ence he had on the Reformation of &s;ome growing Abu&s;es, &s;ignaliz'd him; and he became a <HI>Fellow</HI> of <HI>Emanuel Colledge:</HI> The Ability and Fidelity wherewith he acquitted him&s;elf in his <HI>Fellow&s;hip,</HI> was &s;en&s;ible to the

whole Univer&s;ity; and while he was in this Employment, the more effectual <HI>Grace</HI> of GOD gave him the Experience of a true <HI>Regeneration.</HI> It plea&s;ed the SPIRIT of GOD very powerfully to break into the Soul of this Per&s;on, with &s;uch a Sen&s;e of his being expo&s;ed to the <HI>ju&s;t</HI> Wrath of Heaven, as fill'd him with the mo&s;t unu&s;ual Degrees of Horror and Angui&s;h, as broke not only his <HI>Re&s;t</HI> but his <HI>Heart</HI> al&s;o, and caus'd him to cry out, <HI>While I &s;uffer thy Terrors, O</HI> LORD <HI>I am di&s;tracted:</HI> He long had a Soul har|ra&s;&s;ed with &s;uch Di&s;tre&s;&s;es. He after|wards gave this Account of him&s;elf; <HI>That in the Time of his Agonies, he could rea&s;on him|&s;elf to the</HI> RULE, <HI>and conclude there was no Way but Submi&s;&s;ion to</HI> GOD, <HI>and lying at the Foot of his Mercy in</HI> CHRIST JESUS, <HI>and waiting humbly there, 'till he &s;hould plea&s;e to per&s;wade the Soul of his Favour: Neverthe|le&s;s, when he came to apply this</HI> RULE <HI>to him|&s;elf, in his own Condition, his Rea&s;oning would fail him, he was able to do nothing.</HI> Having been a con&s;iderable while thus troubled with &s;uch Impre&s;&s;ions from the SPIRIT of <HI>Bondage,</HI> as were to fit him for the great Services and Employments which GOD intended him; at length he receiv'd the SPIRIT of <HI>Adoption,</HI> with well-ground|ed Per&s;wa&s;ions of his Intere&s;t in the New-Covenant. It became his Manner at his

<P><Q>Leaving the <HI>Univer&s;ity,</HI> he now had <HI>no Supe|riour,</HI> and <HI>&s;carce any Equal,</HI> for the Skill of treat|ing a troubled Soul: He publickly and fre|quently preach'd about <HI>London;</HI> and in a little Time grew famous for his mini&s;terial Abili|ties, but e&s;pecially for his notable Faculty at the wi&s;e and fit Management of <HI>wounded Spirits.</HI> Mr. <HI>Rogers</HI> of <HI>Dedham,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The famous Mr. <HI>John Rogers,</HI> Mini&s;ter of the Pari&s;h Church of <HI>Dedham</HI> in <HI>England.</HI></NOTE> &s;o highly valued him for his multifarious Abilities, that he u&s;ed many Endeavours to get him &s;ettled

As his <HI>Per&s;on</HI> was adorned with <HI>Learning,</HI> &s;o his <HI>Preaching</HI> was &s;et off with a <HI>Liveline&s;s</HI> extraordinary: Yet the <HI>Vigour</HI> in his Mini&s;try being rai&s;ed by <HI>a Coal from the Altar,</HI> it wou'd be a Wrong to the good SPIRIT of GOD, if HE &s;hould not be acknowledged the Author of it: That SPI|RIT accordingly gave a wonderful and un|u&s;ual Succe&s;s to the Mini&s;try, wherein he &s;o remarkably breathed.

<P>'The Joy of the People in this Light, was but for a Sea&s;on: The con&s;ciencious Non|conformity of Mr. <HI>Hooker,</HI> to &s;ome Rites of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> then vigorou&s;ly pre&s;|&s;ed, e&s;pecially on &s;uch able and u&s;eful Mi|ni&s;ters as were mo&s;t likely to be laid a&s;ide by their &s;crupling tho&s;e Rites, made it ne|ce&s;&s;ary for him to lay down his Mini&s;try at <HI>Chelmsford,</HI> when he had been about <HI>four Years</HI> employed there, in it. Hereupon, at the Reque&s;t of &s;everal eminent Per&s;ons, he kept a <HI>School</HI> at his own hired Hou&s;e, hav|ing our Mr. <HI>John Eliot</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">This was afterwards the reverend and re|nowned Mr. <HI>Eliot</HI> of <HI>Roxbury</HI> in <HI>N.

In a Manu&s;cript written by our ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Eliot,</HI> he gives a very great Ac|count of the <HI>little Academy</HI> then maintained in the Hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>Hooker;</HI> and among other Things, he &s;ays, <Q><HI>To this Place I was called, thro' the infinite Riches of</HI> GOD'S

<Q>While he continued thus in the Heart of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and in the Hearts of the People there; he &s;ignaliz'd his U&s;e|fulne&s;s in many other In&s;tances: The <HI>godly Mini&s;ters</HI> round about the Country wou'd have Recour&s;e to him, to be directed and re&s;olved in their <HI>difficult Ca&s;es;</HI> and it was by his Means that tho&s;e godly Mini&s;ters held their <HI>monthly Meetings,</HI> for <HI>Fa&s;ting, Prayer,</HI> and profitable <HI>Conferences.</HI> He was indeed a <HI>general Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> to the Church of GOD. And that which made the <HI>&s;ilencing</HI> Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> more unaccountable, was, that <HI>&s;even and forty conformable Mini&s;ters</HI> of the neighbouring Towns, under&s;tanding the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI> pretended Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI>'s Mini&s;try to be injurious or offen&s;ive to <HI>them,</HI> &s;ub&s;cribed a <HI>Petition</HI> to the Bi&s;hop for his Continuance in the Mini&s;try at <HI>Chelmsford:</HI> Yet all would not avail. The <HI>&s;piritual Court</HI> &s;itting at <HI>Chelmsford</HI> about 1630, had not only &s;ilenc'd him, but al&s;o bound him in a Bond of <HI>Fifty Pounds,</HI> to appear before the <HI>High Commi&s;&s;ion.</HI> But his Friends advi&s;ed him to forfeit his Bonds rather than throw him&s;elf

any further into the Hands of his Enemies; &s;ent the Sum into Court; and having by the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> a private Rece&s;s for a Time, he fled from the Pur&s;evants to take his Pa&s;&s;age for the LOW COUNTRIES: At parting with &s;ome of his Friends, one of them &s;aid, <HI>Sir, what if the Wind &s;hou'd not be fair when you come to the Ve&s;&s;el?</HI> Whereto he in&s;tantly replied, <HI>Brother, Let us leave that with Him who keep the Wind in the Hol|low of his Hand:</HI> And it was ob&s;erv'd, that tho' the Wind was cro&s;s 'till he came a|board, yet it immediately then came about fair and fre&s;h; and he was no &s;ooner under &s;ail, but the <HI>Officer</HI> arriv'd at the Sea-&s;ide, happily too late to come at him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Arriving in HOLLAND, he was invited to a Settlement with Mr. <HI>Paget</HI> at <HI>Am&s;ter|dam:</HI> But being &s;ecretly willing Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> &s;hould not accept the Invitation, he went to <HI>Delft;</HI> where he was mo&s;t kindly receiv'd by Mr. <HI>Forbs</HI> an aged and holy <HI>Scotch Mi|ni&s;ter,</HI> under who&s;e Mini&s;try many <HI>Engli&s;h Merchants</HI> were then &s;ettled. Mr. <HI>Forbs</HI> manife&s;ted a &s;trong De&s;ire to enjoy the Fel|low&s;hip of Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> in the Work of the Go&s;pel; which he did about <HI>two Years:</HI> In all which Time they lived like Brethren. At the <HI>End of two Years,</HI> he had a Call to <HI>Rotterdam;</HI> which he the more readily ac|cepted, becau&s;e it renewed his Acquaintance

with his invaluable Dr. <HI>Ames,</HI> who had newly left his Place, [viz. <HI>Profe&s;&s;or of Divi|nity</HI>] in the <HI>Fri&s;ian Univer&s;ity.</HI> With him Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> &s;pent the Re&s;idue of his Time in <HI>Holland,</HI> and a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in compo&s;ing &s;ome of his Di&s;cour&s;es: For &s;uch was the Regard which Dr. <HI>Ames</HI> had for him, that notwith|&s;tanding his va&s;t Ability and Experience; yet when he came to the <HI>Narrow</HI> of any Que&s;tion about the <HI>in&s;tituted Wor&s;hip</HI> of GOD, he would &s;till profe&s;s him&s;elf con|quered by Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI>'s Rea&s;on; declaring that <HI>tho' he had been acquainted with many Scholars of divers Nations, yet he never met with Mr.</HI> Hooker's <HI>Equal, either for Preach|ing or for Di&s;puting.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>But having tarried in HOLLAND long enough to &s;ee the State of Religion in the Churches there; he became &s;atisfied it was neither eligible for <HI>Him</HI> to tarry in that Coun|try, nor convenient for <HI>his Friends</HI> to be in|vited thither after him. Wherefore, about this Time, under&s;tanding that many of his Friends in <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> were upon the Wing for a <HI>Wilderne&s;s</HI> in AMERICA, where they hoped for an Opportunity to enjoy and practice the pure Wor&s;hip of CHRIST, in Churches gathered according to his Direction; He readily an&s;wered their Invitation to accom|pany them in this Undertaking.

<PB N="10" REF="005214_0011_1016E59DE0D5CAD0">
Accordingly in <HI>June</HI> 1636, He, with about an <HI>hundred Per&s;ons</HI> in the <HI>fir&s;t Company,</HI> re|moved an <HI>hundred Miles</HI> to the <HI>We&s;tward,</HI> to &s;ettle on the Banks of CONNECTICUT-RIVER: Who not being able to walk a|bove <HI>ten Miles</HI> a Day [thro' the Woods,] took up <HI>near a Fortnight</HI> in their Journey; hav|ing no Pillows to take their nightly Re&s;t on, but &s;uch as their Father <HI>Jacob</HI> &s;ound in the Way to <HI>Padan-aram.</HI> Here [<HI>viz.</HI> at <HI>Hart|ford</HI>] Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> was the chief In&s;trument of beginning ANOTHER COLONY: [<HI>viz.</HI> CONNECTICUT COLONY.]</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Impediments</HI> which hinder Souls from <HI>coming</HI> to Chri&s;t, removed.</HEAD>
<P>_THERE are divers <HI>Impediments</HI> which <HI>hinder</HI> poor Chri&s;tians from <HI>coming</HI> to CHRIST; all which I de&s;ire to reduce to the&s;e following Heads,</P>
<P N="1">I. FIRST, Such <HI>Hinderances</HI> as really <HI>keep
<PB N="2" REF="005214_0017_1016E54A175B0CB8">
Men from coming to take hold of Chri&s;t at all;</HI> which are briefly the&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Blind, Carele&s;s, or Pre&s;umptuous Secu|rity;</HI> whereby Men content them&s;elves with their pre&s;ent Condition, pre&s;uming all is well with them, when there is no &s;uch matter.</P>
<P N="2">2. Being convinced of this, they <HI>bethink how to &s;ave them&s;elves by their own Strength;</HI> and thereupon &s;et upon a Reformation of Life, thinking to make God amends by reforming &s;ome Sins which they hear them&s;elves reproved of by the Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Sinner being convinced of his ut|ter inability to plea&s;e God in him&s;elf, at length gets up a Stair higher, and &s;ees all his Perfor|mances, and Prayers, and Duties to be of no power in them&s;elves, but that he mu&s;t leave all, and cleave only unto Chri&s;t by Faith; and this he thinks he can do well enough, and &s;o <HI>thru&s;ts him&s;elf upon Chri&s;t, thinking all the work is then done, and no more to be looked after.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. If he &s;ees this fails him too, then he goes yet further, and confe&s;&s;eth he cannot come to Chri&s;t, except Chri&s;t give him his Hand, and help him up; therefore now he will <HI>attend on the Ordinances, and labour and be&s;tir him&s;elf hard in the u&s;e of all good Means, conceiving thereby to hammer out at la&s;t a Faith of his own</HI> to make him happy. And here he re&s;ts, hanging as it were upon the out&s;ide of the Ark &s;o long, till
<PB N="3" REF="005214_0018_1016E572FA715D60">
at la&s;t the waves and winds growing fierce and violent, he is beaten off, and &s;o &s;inks for ever.</P>
<P N="2">II. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are OTHER kinds of <HI>Hindrances</HI> which do not indeed deprive a Man of Title and Intere&s;t to eternal Happine&s;s, but <HI>make the way tedious and uncomfortable, &s;o that be cannot come to Chri&s;t &s;o readily as he de&s;ires and longs to do:</HI> The ground whereof is this; when Men, out of carnal Rea&s;on, contrive another way to come to Chri&s;t than ever he ordained or revealed; when we <HI>&s;et up our Standards by God's Standard,</HI> or <HI>our Thre&s;hold by his,</HI> Ezek. 43.8. and out of our own Ima|gination, make another &s;tate of believing than ever Chri&s;t required or ordained. No marvel that we come &s;hort of him: For thus we put Rubs, and make Bars in our way: We mana|cle our Hands, and fetter our Feet, and then &s;ay that we cannot take, nor go: Thus it is with you poor Chri&s;tians, and the Fault is your own But, among&s;t many, there be <HI>three Hindrances</HI> which are chiefly to be ob&s;erved,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Three</HI> main <HI>Hindrances</HI> which <HI>keep</HI> Men from <HI>Chri&s;t</HI></NOTE> by which many <HI>gracious Hearts</HI> are marvelou&s;ly hindered from coming to, and from re|ceiving that Comfort from Chri&s;t which they might, and he is will|ing to impart unto them.</P>
<P N="1">[1] <HI>Fir&s;t;</HI> The di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Soul, being (haply) truly humbled, takes notice of the
<PB N="4" REF="005214_0019_1016E5A773A7A200">
<HI>Beauty of Holine&s;s,</HI> and the Image of God &s;tampt on the Hearts of his Children, and of all tho&s;e precious Promi&s;es which God hath made to all that are his; now the Soul &s;eeing the&s;e, begins thus to Rea&s;on with it &s;elf and &s;aith, <Q>Surely if I were &s;o holy and &s;o graci|ous, then I might have hope to receive the pardon of my Sins: Or were my Heart &s;o enlarged to Duties, and could my Heart be &s;o carried with Power again&s;t my Corrupti|ons, to ma&s;ter them, then there were &s;ome Hope: But when I have <HI>no Power</HI> again&s;t Sin, nor any Heart to &s;eek &s;o importunately for a Chri&s;t, how dare I think that any Mer|cy </Q>belongs to me, having &s;o many Wants? Thus they dare not come to the Promi&s;e; and they will not venture upon it, becau&s;e they have not that Enlargement to Duties, and that Power again&s;t Corruption which &s;ome|times the Saints of God have.</P>
<P>But we mu&s;t know, this doth not hinder; and that we make that a Hindrance, which, in Truth, is none. For (ob&s;erve it) we mu&s;t not think to bring our Enlargements and Hope to the Promi&s;e, but go to the Promi&s;e for them: Hope mu&s;t be &s;tirred, and De&s;ire quickned, and Love and Joy kindled by the Promi&s;e. But who made this Condition of the <HI>Covenant,</HI> That a Man mu&s;t have &s;o much of Enlarge|ment, before he can come to the Promi&s;e? Our Saviour being our Hu&s;band, requires no
<PB N="5" REF="005214_0020_1016E575C0541B40">
Portion with us, nor ever look'd after any: All that he looks for is meer Poverty and Emp|tine&s;s. If thou ha&s;t nothing, yet he will have thee with thy nothing; provided that thou wilt have him. Therefore it is thus written, <HI>The Rich he &s;ends away empty;</HI> but the Poor he &s;atisfies, and the Thir&s;ty he refre&s;hes with Good; and &s;o, as that there is nothing re|quired on our Side but to receive him as a Hu&s;band: For, <HI>Buy without Money</HI> is the Text. You mu&s;t not come and think to buy a Hu&s;|band: The Lord looks for no Power or Suf|ficiency from you, of your&s;elves; nor of your &s;elves any Power again&s;t Corruption, or En|largement to Duties: If you will be content that Chri&s;t &s;hall take all from you, and di&s;po&s;e of you and all; then take a Saviour, and then you have him.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> But the poor Soul &s;aith, <HI>If I go thus hood-wink'd, how &s;hall I know that I do not pre|&s;ume, and how &s;hall I know that I have a true Title to the Promi&s;e?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> I an&s;wer: There is no better Ar|gument in the World to prove that thou ha&s;t an Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, than this, which is thy taking of the Lord Chri&s;t as a Saviour wholly, and as an Hu&s;band only, John 1.12. <HI>As ma|ny as received him, to them he gave Power to be|come the Sons of God, even to them that believe on his Name.</HI> He doth not &s;ay, To as many as had &s;uch Enlargement to Duties, and &s;uch
<PB N="6" REF="005214_0021_1016E5AB915174D8">
Power again&s;t Corruption; but if thou wilt take Chri&s;t upon tho&s;e Terms on which he offers him&s;elf: There is no better Argument under Heaven than that, to prove that thou ha&s;t a Title to the Promi&s;e. Indeed there is a de&s;perate De&s;pair that often &s;eizeth upon the Hearts of di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Sinners.</P>
<P N="2">[2.] Therefore in the <HI>&s;econd</HI> Place, as the Sinner looks upon the <HI>Excellency</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and of <HI>Grace,</HI> and upon <HI>his own In&s;ufficiency</HI> with|al, which makes him that he will not venture upon the Promi&s;e; &s;o he looks too <HI>altogether</HI> upon his own <HI>Sinfulne&s;s and Worthle&s;sne&s;s,</HI> and therefore dare not venture upon it: He views the Number of his Sins &s;o many and vile, and the Continuance of them &s;o long, and durable; and he &s;eeth the Floods of Abo|minations coming in &s;o amain upon his Soul, and Satan to boot, (who helps him forward in all this,) therefore he dares not make out unto Chri&s;t. But this is the Policy of the Devil, who (if he can) will make a Man to &s;ee Sin thro' his own Spectacles, or not to &s;ee it at all; and then to &s;ay, There is Mercy e|nough in a Saviour, and therefore I may live as I li&s;t. But when the Sinner will needs &s;ee his Sin, then he will let him &s;ee nothing but Sin; and this, to the End that he may de&s;pair for ever.</P>
<P>Now here the poor Sinner is at a &s;tand, and can go no further: For tell him of the Mercy
<PB N="7" REF="005214_0022_1016E55888992818">
of God, and of the plenteous Redemption in Chri&s;t, and of the Riches of the Freene&s;s of God's Grace: <Q>What (&s;aith he) &s;hould I think there is any Mercy for <HI>me,</HI> and that I have any Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t? That were &s;trange.</Q> And thus the Soul is always por|ing, and always too much fa&s;tned and &s;ettled upon his Corruptions, ever &s;tirring the Sore, without ever going to the Phy&s;ician. Where note, That a Man is as well kept from looking to Chri&s;t by <HI>De&s;pair,</HI> as by <HI>Pre&s;umption.</HI> Be|fore he &s;ees his Sin, he thinks his Condition is good, and that he hath a Sufficiency of his own, and needs not go to Chri&s;t; and when he &s;ees his Sin, then he beholds &s;o much Vile|ne&s;s in him&s;elf, and in it, that he dares not go to Chri&s;t, le&s;t when he comes before him, he &s;ends him down to that ever-burning Lake of Fire and Brim&s;tone. Herein the Devil is very &s;ubtile: But this doth not hinder our Title to Chri&s;t; neither ought it to di&s;courage us from laying hold on Salvation. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> (Ob&s;erve it) For whom did Chri&s;t come into the World, and for whom did he die when he was come? Was it for the <HI>Righteous?</HI> Such needed him not: It was for the <HI>poor Sinner</HI> that judgeth him&s;elf, that condemns him&s;elf, and that finds he cannot &s;ave him&s;elf. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aith, 2 Tim. 1.15. <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us came into the World to &s;ave Sinners, of whom I am the chief:</HI> And the Prophet, Zech.
<PB N="8" REF="005214_0023_1016E5476E879F00">
13.1. <HI>There is a Fountain opened for Sin and for Uncleanne&s;s;</HI> that is, for all &s;orts of Sins, and kind of Sinners; be their Iniquities never &s;o great, and never &s;o vile, there is a Fountain &s;et open for them; come who will. There was never any &s;aved that was not a Rebel fir&s;t; nor any received to Mercy, that fir&s;t oppo&s;ed not the Mercies of God, and his Grace in Chri&s;t. The fiery Serpents did &s;ting the Peo|ple in the Wilderne&s;s; fir&s;t then they were &s;tung, and being &s;tung, there was a brazen Serpent to heal them. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. Ob&s;erve the Folly of this Plea: What Scripture ever &s;aid, that the Greatne&s;s of <HI>Man's Sin</HI> could hinder the Greatne&s;s of <HI>God's Mercy?</HI> No Scripture &s;aith &s;o; we &s;ee <HI>Da|vid</HI> prayeth to the contrary, P&s;al. 25.11. <HI>Have Mercy upon me, O Lord, and pardon my Sins, for they are great:</HI> Nay, God him&s;elf doth the quite contrary, I&s;ai. 43.24, 25. <HI>Thou ha&s;t made me &s;erve with thy Sins, and wea|ried me with thine Iniquities; yet I am he that blot|teth out thy Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions for my Names Sake.</HI> When the Jews did tire God with their di&s;|tempered Manners, and burthened him with their &s;inful Cour&s;es; then the Lord, for his own Names &s;ake, would not &s;o much as re|member their Iniquities again&s;t them.</P>
<P N="3">3. Again ob&s;erve, That Sins, tho' they be never &s;o heinous of them&s;elves, yet if the Soul can &s;ee them, and the Heart be burdened with
<PB N="9" REF="005214_0024_1016E5798AB005E0">
them, they are &s;o far from hindering the Work of Faith, and from making thee uncapable of Mercy, that they fit thee the rather to go to Chri&s;t. The Truth is (which I pray you to take Notice of) it is not properly our <HI>Un|worthine&s;s,</HI> but our <HI>Pride</HI> and <HI>Haughtine&s;s</HI> that hinders us from coming to Chri&s;t; for we would have &s;omething from our&s;elves, and not all from him. But to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Soul, that &s;ees the Vilene&s;s of his Sins; I &s;ay, &s;uppo&s;e thy Sins were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">; yet upon &s;uch a Suppo&s;e, thou would'&s;t not go to Chri&s;t, as per&s;waded of the Freene&s;s of his Grace; but becau&s;e thy Sins are not many, and upon Conceit that thou ha&s;t a Worthine&s;s in thy &s;elf, and would'&s;t bring &s;omething to Chri&s;t, and not receive all from him; therefore thou keepe&s;t back. And is it not plain (then) that it is thy <HI>Pride</HI> and thy <HI>Self-conceitedne&s;s</HI> that hinders thee? Thou thinke&s;t thou mu&s;t have thus much Grace and Holine&s;s; and Chri&s;t mu&s;t not ju&s;|tify the Ungodly, but the godly Man. But I tell thee, that, upon &s;uch Terms, he will never ju&s;tify thee, or any Man while the World &s;tands.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> But the Soul replies again; <HI>My Sins are wor&s;e than &s;o, not only becau&s;e they are many, but becau&s;e of the Mercy and Salvation that I have rejected, and which hath been offered me from Day to Day.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="005214_0025_1016E5AE346EDA00"><HI>An&s;w.</HI> But, <HI>I an&s;wer:</HI> This cannot hurt thee, provided that thou can&s;t &s;ee tho&s;e Evils of thine: For then, tho' thou ha&s;t ca&s;t away the Kindne&s;s of the Lord, yet the Lord will not ca&s;t thee away, if thou wilt come and &s;eek him earne&s;tly again and again, I&s;ai. 57.17, 18. <HI>For the Iniquity of his Covetou&s;ne&s;s I was wroth</HI> (&s;aith God) <HI>and I &s;mote him; I hid my|&s;elf, and he went on frowardly in the Way of his own Heart.</HI> If this could have hindered, <HI>Ju|dah</HI> &s;hould never have received Mercy: But the Text &s;aith, I have &s;een his Ways, and will heal him; Jer. 3.1. <HI>Thou ha&s;t play'd the Har|lot with many Lovers, yet turn again unto me, &s;aith the Lord.</HI> So then, there is no Time pa&s;t, if a Man has but a Heart to return. There is no Limitation of the Riches of God's free Grace, except the Sin again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t; therefore &s;aith Chri&s;t, Rev. 3.20. <HI>I &s;tand at the Door and knock:</HI> Though he cry 'till he be hoar&s;e, and &s;tand 'till he be weary, yet he &s;tands &s;till: If any adulterous or de|ceitful Wretch open, the Lord will come in, and bring &s;tore of Comfort to him, and &s;up with him.</P>

for di&s;honouring God, and offending him &s;o many Ways.</Q> But I &s;ay,</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> This Hurts not neither; provided that thy Heart be weary of it &s;elf, becau&s;e it cannot be weary of Sin, Mich, 7.18. <HI>The Lord &s;heweth Mercy, becau&s;e he will &s;hew Mercy:</HI> It is not becau&s;e <HI>thou</HI> can&s;t plea&s;e him, but be|cau&s;e Mercy plea&s;eth him. When did the Lord &s;hew Mercy to <HI>Paul?</HI> I &s;ay, When, but even when <HI>Paul</HI> did expre&s;s mo&s;t Malice again&s;t him? Acts 16. <HI>Saul, Saul, why per&s;ecute&s;t thou me?</HI> He per&s;ecutes Chri&s;t, and yet Chri&s;t pities him, and &s;hews him Mercy: And &s;o the churli&s;h Jaylor, when he was mo&s;t oppo&s;ite again&s;t the <HI>Means of Grace,</HI> the Lord even then &s;hewed mo&s;t Compa&s;&s;ion upon him. He that (before) re&s;i&s;ted the <HI>Means of Grace,</HI> was now bro't home by tho&s;e Means that before he re&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> <Q>But wo to me (&s;aith the poor Soul) you are now come to the Quick; this very Word is like a Mil&s;tone about my Neck, and I in the Sea, ready to be &s;unk for ever. This is the Depth of that <HI>Ba&s;ene&s;s</HI> that lies on me, even this, that <HI>all the Means</HI> can do no better upon me. Why, what tho' <HI>Paul</HI> and the Jaylor were bad enough, &s;o bad as you &s;ay? Yet they were made better by the Means: But this is my hopele&s;s Condition, that the Means of Grace prevail nothing on me. Oh, is there &s;uch an heart in Hell as I have? For how bad mu&s;t it needs be,
<PB N="12" REF="005214_0027_1016E545B8001328">
when all the Means in the World can do it no more Good! And now, methinks I feel my Heart more hard and inexorable under all God's Ordinances, than when at fir&s;t I believed. My Condition therefore is (mo&s;t certainly) hopele&s;s, &s;eeing the Means that &s;hould &s;often me, do but harden me, and make me wor&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> This is <HI>the la&s;t Plea</HI> whereby the Devil keeps in, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth the Heart of a poor heartle&s;s Sinner. But let me an&s;wer thee, and for An&s;wer, I &s;ay: This hurts not neither: For here at lea&s;t thou may&s;t have Hope of Mercy? And here ob&s;erve the <HI>three</HI> Things by Way of <HI>An&s;wer;</HI> and know that.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Fir&s;t;</HI> The <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Means of Grace</HI> do work Good, if they make thee more &s;en|&s;ible of thy Hardne&s;s and Deadne&s;s. Tho' haply they work not <HI>that Good,</HI> and <HI>after that Manner</HI> that thou de&s;ire&s;t; yet if they make thee to &s;ee thy Ba&s;ene&s;s, thy Hardne&s;s of Heart, and Dulne&s;s of Spirit, in Regard of that Body of Death which hangs upon thee, then the Word and they work in the be&s;t Manner; becau&s;e it is after God's Manner, how&s;oever not after thine. That Phy&s;ick works mo&s;t kindly, that makes the Party &s;ick before it works: So it is with the Word. Before, thou had&s;t a proud Heart, and did&s;t therefore lift up thy &s;elf in thine own Abilities, and did&s;t tru&s;t in thine own Strength, and thou tho't&s;t
<PB N="13" REF="005214_0028_1016E57E09B15A90">
that thy Care, and the Improvement of the Means, would work Wonders: But now the Word works &s;weetly, when it makes thee ap|prehen&s;ive, that a wounded Soul is the Gift of God, not of Man, nor of the Means; when it makes thee look up to God for it, and to prize it when thou ha&s;t it; and to wait upon God with thy daily Prayers, &s;till to continue it &s;o. To feel Deadne&s;s, is Life; and to feel Hardne&s;s is Softne&s;s: Only remember this one <HI>Caution;</HI> except there be &s;ome Lu&s;t or Di&s;temper that thy Heart hankers after, (for then the Word will harden thee, becau&s;e thou hardne&s;t thy &s;elf) that one I &s;ay excepted, thou art in a good Way.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Secondly;</HI> (Mark this, I be&s;eech you) Thou art the Cau&s;e why thy Heart is not &s;oft|ned, and why the <HI>Word</HI> works not upon thy Soul: The Di&s;temper of thine own Heart, hinders the working of the Word, and Di&s;|pen&s;ation of God's Providence, and the Tenour of the Covenant of Grace. Thou thinke&s;t to limit the holy One of <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> but that may not be: For, his Covenant is a Covenant of Grace; and the Lord (who is free) will not &s;tand bent to thy Bow, or give thee Grace when thou wilt; for,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wait for Mercy.</NOTE> <HI>it is not for</HI> us <HI>to know the Times and Sea|&s;ons.</HI> What if the Lord will not give thee Grace this Year, nor the next, nor all thy Life? If at the la&s;t Ga&s;p he will drop in a

<PB N="32" REF="005214_0047_1016E5BBA0215B68">
Truth is, this De&s;pair of the Soul is that which cuts the Sinews of Man's Comfort, and takes off the Power &amp; Edge of all the Means of Grace; it daunts all a Man's Endeavours; nay, it plucks up Endeavours by the very Roots: For <HI>that which a Man de&s;pairs off, he will never labour after.</HI> It's here, as with a Man in the Pangs of Death: Unto &s;uch a Man, as all Things are unavailable for his Good: His Bed will not ea&s;e him, Meat will not refre&s;h him, chafing will not revive him; at la&s;t we &s;ay he is gone, he is a dead Man; Friends leave him, Phy&s;icians leave him: They may go and pray for him, and mourn for him, but they cannot recover him. So this De&s;pair of Soul makes a Man ca&s;t off all Hope, and lie down in a for|lorn Condition, expecting no Good to come. Alas, &s;aith the poor Soul, what &s;killeth for a Man to pray? What profiteth it a Man to read? What Benefit in all the Means of Grace? The Truth of it is, the Stone is rolled upon me, and my Condemnation is &s;ealed for ever, and therefore I will never look after Chri&s;t, Grace and Salvation any more. Let him come to hear the Word, and mark how he ca&s;ts off the Benefit of it. It was marvellous, &s;ea&s;on|able and profitable, it was the good Word of God unto &s;uch as have &s;hare therein: Why then may not you expect Benefit therefrom? No, &s;aith the Soul, the Time of Grace is pa&s;t, the Day is gone. If Mini&s;ters would pray for

That's a &s;weet pa&s;&s;age of <HI>David's,</HI> P&s;alm 77.7. <HI>Will the Lord ca&s;t me off for ever? I &s;aid this is my Infirmity,</HI> &s;aith the Text.

<P N="2">(2) <HI>Secondly.</HI> This marvellou&s;ly condemns that great Sin of <HI>Pre&s;umption;</HI> a Sin more fre|quent, and if it be po&s;&s;ible, more dangerous. The Pre&s;umption of carnal Hypocrites that bol&s;ter them&s;elves up with marvellous Boldne&s;s in their cour&s;e. It is as true here, and I be|&s;eech you ob&s;erve it, as they &s;aid <HI>Saul hath &s;lain his thou&s;ands, and</HI> David <HI>his ten thou&s;ands:</HI> Di&s;|pair hath &s;lain his thou&s;ands, but <HI>Pre&s;umption</HI> his ten thou&s;ands. That Men may &s;wear, and lie, and cozen, and break all Commands, and yet hope to be &s;aved. They hope Grace will &s;ave them, and yet re&s;i&s;t Grace. They hope Je&s;us Chri&s;t will &s;ave them, and yet op|po&s;e Chri&s;t. This is that which hath &s;lain
<PB N="34" REF="005214_0049_1016E5BD28339870">
many thou&s;ands among us; and they are few that have not &s;plit upon this Rock. And there|fore I &s;ay, this &s;erves to reprove the Ba&s;ene&s;s of &s;uch Hypocrites that boa&s;t them&s;elves, and compare their Hopes with the Hopes of the Saints. It is true, &s;ay they, I cannot walk &s;o freely, I cannot repeat a Sermon, I have not tho&s;e Parts that they have; yet I hope to be &s;aved as well as they. This is that which hath &s;lain &s;o many thou&s;ands of Souls that are now roaring in Hell; and they may thank <HI>Pre&s;ump|tion</HI> for it.</P>
<P>Now this Hope is not the Hope of the Saints. The Hope of the Saints is a grounded Hope; but the&s;e Hopes hang upon &s;ome idle Pleas and fooli&s;h Pretences, and &s;ome carnal Rea&s;ons&punc; But I tell you they will fail, and &s;ink into the bottomle&s;s Pit ere they are aware. It is the Command and Coun&s;el of <HI>Peter,</HI> That <HI>every Man &s;hould be ready to give an account of his Faith and Hope that is in him.</HI> Look to the Rea&s;ons that carry you, and to the Arguments that per&s;wade you; &s;ee they be not groundle&s;s and fooli&s;h Hopes.

Look about, I &s;ay; <HI>good Hope hath good Rea&s;ons,</HI> grounded Hope grounded Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P N="3">(3) <HI>Thirdly.</HI> The Saints of God many times are deprived of Comfort; not becau&s;e God with-holds it, but <HI>becau&s;e they put it from them|&s;elves,</HI>

<P N="1">I. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Cure and <HI>Help</HI> is this;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. <HI>Help</HI></NOTE>
We mu&s;t not look too long, nor pore too much, or unwarrantably upon our own Corruptions within, &s;o far as
<PB N="36" REF="005214_0051_1016E5350CF79480">
to be feared or di&s;heartned by them from com|ing to the Riches of God's Grace. For this is a &s;ure and everla&s;ting Truth, that what&s;o|ever Sight of Sin unfits a Man for Mercy, when he may take it, and it is offered, that &s;ight of Sin is ever &s;inful, tho' it have never &s;o fair an out&s;ide of Sorrow and deep Humiliation. Namely, as when we think, and &s;ay, (as often we do) Had I a Soul &s;o thorowly humbled, and brui&s;ed, and &s;oftened, and &s;o forth, I could do well enough. And thus the Devil keeps us in Sin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The godly Sorrow what it is.</NOTE> by poring too long and much upon our Sins; as thinking there|by to get from them. But &s;uch a cour&s;e is a &s;inful cour&s;e. Tell not me of Sorrow, and Repent|ance, and Humiliation; all that Sorrow, and Humiliation, and Repentance, is naught, that keeps a Man from receiving Mercy when there is need, and it is offered. See this in <HI>Abraham,</HI> he had this Promi&s;e, that he &s;hould have a Son in his old Age: And Rom. 4.19. <HI>He being not weak in Faith, regarded not his old Age or Deadne&s;s, nor the Barrenne&s;s of</HI> Sarah <HI>'s Womb, but believed in him who had promi&s;ed it.</HI> There he re&s;ts, and there he &s;tays; he &s;aw his Body was dead, yet there was a living Promi&s;e; and what tho' <HI>Sarah</HI>'s Womb was barren, yet the Promi&s;e was fruitful. He knew his own Dead|ne&s;s and her Barrenne&s;s; but he &s;tood not long there. As <HI>Abraham</HI> therefore, &s;o we may
<PB N="37" REF="005214_0052_1016E5E7A07163B0">
&s;ee our Sins, and con&s;ider our many Weak|ne&s;&s;es, but mu&s;t not &s;o &s;ettle upon them, or con&s;ider of them as to be hindered by them from coming to God for Mercy, which he freely offers us, and we &s;tand in need of: For, while the Soul of a Man is daily plodding upon his own Mi&s;ery and di&s;tempered Life, the&s;e two things follow.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> Stop the Stream of God's Pro|mi&s;e, and let down the Sluce again&s;t it, &s;o that the Promi&s;e cannot enter into us.</P>
<P>And 2. <HI>Secondly.</HI> We &s;et open the Stream and Floodgate of Corruption, and make it to run mo&s;t violently down, and to flood in upon us; and in the end to over-whelm us. Now the Inconvenience ari&s;ing hereby, is enough to &s;lay the be&s;t Chri&s;tian in the World; for what can a Man get out of his Corruption? He can have no more thereof than is to be had; and it is in vain to look for Comfort where it is not to be had: All this, and the lea&s;t of all this may di&s;hearten us, but will not encourage us, or put Heart into us. See the Humility and Wi&s;dom of the Woman of <HI>Canaan, Mat.</HI> 15.17. &s;he follows Chri&s;t; but he li&s;tens not to her, but gives her a &s;ore Foil, and calls her <HI>Dog;</HI> and &s;aith, you Gentiles are <HI>Dogs;</HI> and the Go&s;pel of Grace and Salvation is the <HI>Children's Bread.</HI> Now if &s;he had only con|&s;idered the Words of Chri&s;t, and only looked into her &s;elf and her own Ba&s;ene&s;s, &s;he had ne|ver
<PB N="38" REF="005214_0053_1016E5BFD5BFB408">
come to have received either Mercy or Comfort from him. But &s;he &s;aith, Truth Lord, I am a <HI>Dog,</HI> yet the <HI>Dogs eat of the Crumbs that fall from their Ma&s;ter's Table.</HI> This was her Re&s;olution: Wherein there are two Things which expre&s;s and &s;et forth the Frame of a gracious Heart, a Heart that is truly wi&s;e to attend to it's own Ba&s;ene&s;s with Faith: And that is her <HI>Humility</HI> and <HI>Wi&s;dom:</HI> As if &s;he had &s;aid, Thou &s;aye&s;t I am a <HI>Gentile</HI> and a <HI>Dog;</HI> I confe&s;s it: There's her Humility. Yet tho' I am a Dog, I will not go out of Doors, but lie under the Table for Mercy: There's her Wi&s;dom. And thus &s;he; and &s;o we mu&s;t, and &s;hould when our Corruptions (as I &s;aid) flood in upon us, and we &s;ee our&s;elves quite lo&s;t, and damned in our Sins, we mu&s;t then &s;ay, In truth Lord, I am as bad as thy Word can make me, yet let me not fly from Mercy, but lie at the Feet of my Saviour's Mercy, 'till he look upon me as once upon <HI>Peter, Luke</HI> 22.61.</P>
<P>It is fit, and we ought to &s;ee our Sins: But &s;tay we mu&s;t not too long there: See them we mu&s;t, but not fa&s;ten on them, &s;o as to &s;hackle us from coming to Chri&s;t.

<P N="1">1. <HI>Fir&s;t;</HI> Let the Soul in this Ca&s;e bear upon the Almightine&s;s of the Power of God, who &s;aid to <HI>Abraham, I am God all-&s;ufficient,</HI> Gen. 17.1. For if thou be per&s;waded of the All-&s;ufficiency of God, that A&s;&s;urance cannot but &s;tay thee (&s;lipping) from falling. And here remember that God can do more than thou can&s;t think. He is able, and doth thee good, tho' thou know it not. And further, con&s;ider that the Soul cannot doubt of God's Will, but with that very Doubt makes &s;ome Que&s;tion of his Power. This for the fir&s;t Rule.</P>
<P N="2">2. For the <HI>Second.</HI> And &s;econdly, it bids check to thine own Heart for meddling with God's Secrets, and for prying &s;o into his Clo|&s;et of hidden Coun&s;els. For no Man &s;hould go beyond his Bounds; and it appertains not to thee to look into this Ark of Matters &s;eal|ed up. Deut. 29.29. <HI>Secret Things belong to God, but revealed Things belong to us.</HI> And <HI>who hath known the Mind of God?</HI> &s;aith <HI>Paul,</HI> 1 Cor. 2.16. Mark this, you that will be climbing up the Ladder of God's eter|nal Prede&s;tination, and going up into the Skies to know what God's &s;ecret Mind is. Keep your Stations wi&s;ely; for neither the Devil, nor all the Devils in Hell, ever knew the Mind of the Lord. When <HI>Jonah</HI> cried again&s;t

<HI>Nineveh,</HI> &s;aying, Within forty Days all you; that is, all you Drunkards, and Adulterers, and Murderers, and others, &s;hall be de&s;troyed: Mark here how the King re&s;olves; his Words are, Jonah 4.19. <HI>Who can tell if the Lord will repent, and &s;tay his fierce Wrath that we peri&s;h not?</HI> Therefore when the Devil tells thee thus much, and &s;aith, God hath appointed a Way to Salvation, and you have had the Means, and did not profit by them, therefore God will never &s;hew you Mercy, nor give you Grace. Thus the Devil. But how can he tell that? Surely all the Devils in Hell cannot tell it: Say with thy &s;elf, Let me walk in that Cour&s;e which God hath appointed and commanded, and do that which I ought; and then I may &s;ay, and with Comfort &s;ay it, Who knows but God may break the Heart of a proud, rebellious, contrarying Sinner, &s;uch as mine is, and &s;uch as I am?

<P><PB N="52" REF="005214_0067_1016E5CEAFE11C50">The be&s;t Chri&s;tians are mo&s;t &s;u&s;picious of them&s;elves, and none fuller of Doubts and Fears, than tho&s;e that have lea&s;t Cau&s;e to fear or doubt that their E&s;tates are broken and bad.

Therefore it is worth the Time to hear what <HI>David</HI> &s;aith, P&s;al. 42.8. <HI>The Lord &s;hall command his Lov|ing-Kindne&s;s in the Morning.</HI> It is a Phra&s;e taken from Princes and great Men, who&s;e Words are a Law of Command.

Tell it, Tho' it hath been a Traytor to me, I have been a good King to it. And tell it, that tho' it hath been a Rebel to me, I have yet been a loving God to it.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">4. <HI>Help.</HI></NOTE>The <HI>fourth Cure</HI> is this.

If thou art to be approved, let the Word of God do it: And let the &s;ame Word examine thee, if thou come&s;t to be examined, If this Word &s;peak for thee, no matter, tho' all Men and Angels &s;peak again&s;t thee, and if it condemn thee, no matter who &s;peaks for thee: By it thou ri&s;e&s;t or falle&s;t to thine own Ma&s;ter.

For if you take that Way, and turn not back, you can never come to Chri&s;t, no Way to him that Way.

have you no Humility, becau&s;e none to your Mind, or not &s;o much, or not in &s;uch a Man|ner as you require? Oh Pride; and Pride in the highe&s;t Degree!</P>

Therefore you (the Saints of God) that have been thus pe&s;ter'd, and thus po&s;&s;e&s;t to become your own Enemies, remember (when your Hearts thus begin to &s;lide away) to take your Hearts unto you, and not to give them the Reins at &s;uch de&s;perate Conclu&s;ions again&s;t God and Con&s;cience. Deal better with your Souls, and &s;ay, Good Lord, this is the proud unyielding Di&s;temper of this vile Heart of mine. For, what would I have?

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Now follow &s;ome <HI>Means</HI> to ob|tain an Intere&s;t in the <HI>Pro|mi&s;es,</HI> and improve them for our Benefit.</HEAD>
<P>_IT re&s;teth that I &s;hew you &s;ome <HI>Means,</HI> whereby a Man may &s;o improve his Time, that at la&s;t he may obtain this ble&s;&s;ed E&s;tate of being glad in the Lord. The <HI>Means</HI> are <HI>four.</HI> But before I begin with them, you mu&s;t fir&s;t know that we may u&s;e the <HI>Means,</HI> and yet
<PB N="77" REF="005214_0092_1016E600C52185B8">
find no Means under Heaven to do it, except God &s;trike the Stroke. You mu&s;t therefore wait upon GOD, and the SPIRIT of GOD in the U&s;e of the Means for this Matter, by believ|ing rightly to your A&s;&s;urance. For, &s;o the Text &s;aith, Phil. 1.19. <HI>To you it is given to believe:</HI> It mu&s;t be given therefore: And <HI>Faith is the</HI> free <HI>Gift of God,</HI> Eph. 2.8. It is GOD then that mu&s;t do it; who yet will not do it without us, being rea&s;onable Men and Women in the Power of Willing. A|gain, The LORD affords us <HI>Means;</HI> yet not to u&s;e them, and give HIM the &s;lip. And here it is a good Saying; <HI>Let the</HI> LORD <HI>do what he will, and let us do what we &s;hould.</HI> We mu&s;t not think when we have the Means, that we can get Faith pre&s;ently: For, as <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aith, Eph. 1.10. <HI>The &s;ame Power that rai&s;ed up Je&s;us from the Dead, mu&s;t make us able to believe;</HI> or el&s;e all the Angels in Heaven, and all the Mini&s;ters on Earth, and all the Help that Men and Means can give us, will do us no Good.</P>
<P>Now the Means are of divers Kinds: As, <HI>Hearing,</HI> and <HI>Prayer,</HI> and <HI>Sacraments,</HI> which are the Conduit-Pipes thro' which God com|municates Faith. But I let them pa&s;s, and fa&s;ten upon tho&s;e which are needful for feeble Chri&s;tians, to the bringing of them into this ble&s;&s;ed State of rightly believing. And the&s;e are &s;uch as follow.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="78" REF="005214_0093_1016E5DE3A3ECFF8">1. <HI>Means. Fir&s;t;</HI> We mu&s;t, as much as in us lies, labour to pull away all tho&s;e <HI>carnal outward Stays</HI> that the Soul leans upon, and all other like Succours, and what&s;oever Con|tentment it is, which a poor Sinner doth be|take him&s;elf to, as to his Refuge for Relief and Help; that when all the&s;e are taken from us, we may be forced to go for Succour thi|ther, where right Succour is to be had. It is a Thing natural to us all, even from our fir&s;t Parents, a De&s;ire to have the Staff in our own Hands, and to be able to &s;upply our &s;elves of all Nece&s;&s;aries, without being beholden to o|thers, or to any.</P>
<P>Now therefore, the Way to make the Soul to lean upon CHRIST, is, to pluck away all tho&s;e <HI>deceiving Props.</HI> The la&s;t Thing we fly unto is the <HI>Promi&s;e;</HI> which if we could find Good any where el&s;e than in CHRIST, we would never go to him for it. GOD hears la&s;t of us: And therefore here we &s;hould do with our&s;elves, as the Enemy doth with a City be&s;ieged, when he would make the Inhabi|tants, or tho&s;e that keep it, to yield; The Way he takes is to fami&s;h them, to cut off all Provi&s;ion, and &s;top all Pa&s;&s;ages, &s;o that none can come to relieve them; then they pre&s;ently yield them&s;elves to the Mercy of the A&s;&s;ailant: So it is with our Nature. And &s;eeing it is &s;o that we are &s;till tru&s;ting to <HI>our own Strengths,</HI> and relying upon <HI>&s;omething of
<PB N="79" REF="005214_0094_1016E60258F41F60">
our own;</HI> the be&s;t Way were to fami&s;h the Heart, by cutting off all the Means and Com|forts whereby the &s;ame is &s;uccoured, and qui|eted, but not rightly in Chri&s;t. For when the Heart is thus fami&s;hed, it will then &s;eek out to a SAVIOUR, and there betake it &s;elf, becau&s;e there is no other Thing or Means o|therwi&s;e to help it.</P>
<P>The poor Woman in the Go&s;pel had &s;pent all her Goods upon the <HI>Phy&s;icians, Matth.</HI> 5.26, 27. and if &s;he had had but a little Means left, yea, but one Farthing-token (for any Thing that I know, or doth appear) &s;he would never have gone to CHRIST: But when all the&s;e failed, then &s;he was forced to &s;eek to CHRIST, that was ready and willing to do that for her, and more than &s;he de&s;ired. Our Souls mu&s;t have &s;omething to bear upon, and they cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without &s;ome Under-Props. Hereupon therefore, when all our carnal Hopes are taken from us, we &s;tay (as we mu&s;t needs) upon the <HI>Promi&s;e,</HI> becau&s;e we have nothing el&s;e to re&s;t upon. Yet it is not required (tho' I thus &s;peak) that a Man &s;hould ca&s;t away <HI>all outward Comforts,</HI> &s;uch as GOD affords him for the Interim here: Oh no: But only this; That (though he have much this Way) yet that he labour to get his Heart to &s;ee and acknowledge the In&s;uffi|ciency and Nothingne&s;s of them all, 'till he have the &s;uparlative Comfort, CHRIST, a|bove
<PB N="80" REF="005214_0095_1016E518875428E0">
above all; and not to repo&s;e in <HI>them</HI> (having them) as &s;ome do, making them our whole Contentment, and &s;ole Re&s;t: For then they are but lying Vanities, and broken Staves, which will not only cozen us, but pierce us too, and that deeply.</P>
<P>And now when the Soul &s;eeth that the&s;e Things cannot &s;uccour it, but lay it in a wor&s;e Ca&s;e; a Man will then be content to have his Heart divor&s;ed from them. And here it is with the Soul as it was with <HI>Noah's Dove,</HI> when the Ark began to re&s;t upon the Moun|tain of <HI>Ararat: Noah</HI> then &s;ent out the Dove; but the Dove <HI>found no Re&s;t for the Sole of her Foot.</HI> No que&s;tion there were many dead Carca&s;es to &s;ettle upon; but the Dove found no Re&s;t, 'till &s;he came to the Ark again. So when a Man finds no Re&s;t in any Thing the Creature affords, and can get no Footing for the Soul there to &s;tay it &s;elf upon; then it betakes it &s;elf to CHRIST the <HI>Ark,</HI> and goes home to the Promi&s;e, and re&s;ts there, and ex|pects from thence what is needful for it. As (therefore) in the Art of Swimming; he that will &s;wim, mu&s;t pluck his Feet from the Bottom, and commit him&s;elf to the Stream to bear him up: So in this our Purpo&s;e to Hea|ven, we mu&s;t draw our Hearts from the&s;e vain Things below, and the&s;e from them; and tho' we have Honour and Preferments, yet we mu&s;t put no Confidence in them, but
<PB N="81" REF="005214_0096_1016E52CD3E4ED10">
pluck our Affections, as it were Feet from them, and learn by our Believing to commit our &s;elves wholly to the Power of the <HI>Pro|mi&s;e,</HI> and thence to receive Comfort, and per|manent abiding.</P>
<P>Let not the Gods of this World, then, as Honour, and Profit, and Plea&s;ures, deceive thee. Did the Pride of <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s Heart de|liver him? Did the Riches of the rich Man in Hell &s;ave him? Did <HI>Herod</HI>'s Applau&s;e that he had, do him any good? Did the&s;e Gods &s;ecure them? Nay, have they not left them in the Lurch? Therefore let us take our Hearts off from the&s;e Things, and (in Com|pari&s;on to tho&s;e of our better Life) have a ba&s;e E&s;teem of them, and &s;ee &s;o great a Va|nity and Emptine&s;s, and In&s;ufficiency in them all; that we may be forced to &s;eek to Chri&s;t, and &s;ay as <HI>David, Help Lord; for vain is the Help of Man.</HI> Labour we further to &s;ee the privy Wiles of our own Hearts, and to hunt out all tho&s;e Mazes, and Turnings, and Windings of our &s;ubtle Souls: For here it is wonderful to &s;ee how the Soul is ready to hang her Comforts upon every Hedge, and to &s;hift and &s;hirk in every By-corner for them. Now when thou &s;ee&s;t thine Heart thus &s;eeking Com|fort in vain Helps, call it from them, and pluck them away, and up by the Roots, and &s;ee the Emptine&s;s of them: Then will thy
<PB N="82" REF="005214_0097_1016E5E0EFCCF428">
Heart be fit and ready to make out to CHRIST. And this for the <HI>fir&s;t Means.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Secondly;</HI> Therefore when this is done, there is in &s;ome Part, &s;ome Way made for the Promi&s;e to come into thy Soul; therefore la|bour thou in the <HI>&s;econd Place,</HI> to have thy Heart po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed thoro'ly, and per&s;waded ef|fectually of the <HI>Fulne&s;s</HI> of <HI>that Good</HI> which is in the <HI>Promi&s;e,</HI> and of that <HI>&s;atisfactory Mercy</HI> and <HI>Freene&s;s</HI> of the <HI>Grace</HI> that is in CHRIST; &s;o that the Soul may be e&s;tabli&s;h'd with that full Content which is to be had in the <HI>Riches</HI> of the <HI>Promi&s;e.</HI> But mark what I &s;ay; Let us per&s;wade our Hearts fir&s;t; and not content our &s;elves that we are able to di&s;pute &s;ome|what fully of the Excellency of the <HI>Promi&s;e,</HI> and of tho&s;e Riches in it, thro' the free Grace of GOD in CHRIST. For, what is it to purpo&s;e that the Heart knows this, and know|ing it, to be &s;o fore-&s;tall'd, that it can never come to the <HI>Promi&s;e?</HI> Therefore leave not thy Heart 'till it come to value the Promi&s;e by that which the Word &s;peaketh of it, in a true Account. I &s;ay, leave not thy Heart, 'till thou &s;ee the <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> of Grace mo&s;t beau|tiful in thine Eye; and that thy Heart may get &s;ome Earne&s;t touching the Goodne&s;s of GOD, and the Riches of his Grace towards thee by the &s;ame. And here bring thy Heart to know and &s;ee, that the <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> is better than all the Riches and Honours that thou

can&s;t have, or the World can be&s;tow: For &s;o we read, P&s;al. 9.10. <HI>They that</HI> know thee, <HI>will tru&s;t in thee; for thou, Lord, ha&s;t never failed them that &s;eek thee.</HI> If thou know|e&s;t and wilt believe <HI>this,</HI> this Kind of Know|ledge and Per&s;wa&s;ion cannot but breed Con|fidence and Re&s;olution, and (con&s;equently) quiet the Heart. We dare tru&s;t a Friend who&s;e Faithfulne&s;s we have tried; and we re&s;t upon that which we know by the &s;ure Card of Experience. The <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> of GOD are (all of them) as true as Go&s;pel. Seek from one End of the Heaven to the other, turn all the Bible over; and &s;ee if ever any Man leaned on the <HI>Promi&s;e,</HI> and the Lord did not perform what he had promi&s;ed for the Good of his Soul. <HI>Except the Lord had been my De|light, I &s;hould have peri&s;hed in my Trouble,</HI> (&s;aith <HI>David,</HI> P&s;al. 119.92.) <HI>My Fle&s;h faileth, and my Heart al&s;o; but thou art the Strength of my Heart, and my Portion forever.</HI> P&s;al. 73.26.</P>
<P>But here lies a great Matter, a Work of marvellous Difficulty and great Nece&s;&s;ity; and therefore, that thy Heart may &s;it down &s;atisfied with the Sufficiency of the <HI>Promi&s;e:</HI> I will propound <HI>three Rules</HI> how the <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> may be <HI>improved</HI> and conduce to thy <HI>&s;ingular Benefit</HI> here and hereafter.</P>

<HEAD>How to improve the Promi&s;es for our Benefit.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Rule</HI> 1. For the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of <HI>the&s;e Rules:</HI> La|bour daily to pre&s;ent thy Soul a <HI>greater Good</HI> in the <HI>Promi&s;e,</HI> than thou can&s;t &s;ee any where el&s;e. It is a Man's Skill, (and it &s;hould be his Endeavour) daily to look narrowly to his Heart, and to &s;ee what it is that the Heart de&s;ires mo&s;t; and accordingly to pre&s;ent the greate&s;t Good unto it. And what may that be? Even that which hath more of Content|ment in it, than any Thing el&s;e in the World. And here, we &s;hould deal with our Hearts as Men will with a corrupt Ju&s;tice, when they would have him to be on their Side; there, the only Way is to bribe him; but tho' this be &s;inful in that Ca&s;e, yet it is good to bribe (as it were) the corrupt Heart with the <HI>Goodne&s;s</HI> of the <HI>Promi&s;e;</HI> that &s;o the Heart may cleave to it, and long after it. Do Honours, or Riches, or the Applau&s;e of Men, or any earthly Plea&s;ures offer thee Content and Satisfaction? Then per&s;wade thy Heart there is a greater <HI>Worth</HI> in the <HI>Pro|mi&s;e,</HI> than can be had in all them. For here is <HI>an exceeding Weight of Glory:</HI> And he that hath it &s;hall be made a <HI>King,</HI> and &s;hall have that Glory that will <HI>never fade.</HI> Further, Doth thy Heart hanker after earthly Joy and Mirth? Thou &s;halt find more Joy in the <HI>Promi&s;e,</HI> than in the cracking of the&s;e Thorns.
<PB N="85" REF="005214_0100_1016E62C8733E328">
Doth thy Heart hanker after Riches? Tell thy Heart that there are <HI>un&s;earchable Riches in</HI> CHRIST, and that thro' him we have a Title to all the <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> of this Life and a better. We know that he that offers mo&s;t for the Bargain hath it; therefore we &s;hould ob&s;erve the goings-out of our Hearts, and what Of|fers are made to give them the be&s;t Content, and with &s;uch to pre&s;ent them. This the <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> doth; and this with a greater Good in GOD, than in all Things in the World be&s;ide. Therefore, <HI>Oh the Height, and Depth, and Length, and Breadth of the Love of</HI> CHRIST, <HI>which pa&s;&s;eth Knowledge!</HI></P>
<P>The Con&s;ideration of &s;o much, &s;hould not only work a Longing after CHRIST, and the <HI>Promi&s;e;</HI> but fill our Faces with Shame and Confu&s;ion, that ever we &s;hould &s;et &s;o light by &s;uch Riches of Mercy, and walk unworthy of &s;o great Salvation. Could we comprehend the unmea&s;urable Dimen&s;ions of GOD'S Love and Goodne&s;s revealed in his Word; O how would our Hearts be enflamed towards him! When the Sinner thinks thus with him&s;elf; I that have done all that I could again&s;t &s;o <HI>good</HI> a GOD, that my Heart even bleeds to think of it; there was no Name under Hea|ven that I tore in Pieces more, or &s;o much, as God's Name; his <HI>Wounds,</HI> and <HI>Life,</HI> and <HI>Heart-Blood</HI> I have rent and torn a thou&s;and Times. Nay, there was no Command in

the World that my Soul &s;o much de&s;pi&s;ed, as the Command of the LORD JESUS. There was no Spirit which ever &s;pake to me, which I &s;o much re&s;i&s;ted as the Spirit of the <HI>Almighty.</HI> Oh how many &s;weet Motions hath the LORD let into my Soul, thereby to force me from my Cour&s;es &s;o ba&s;e, and Practices &s;o &s;inful? By how many Mercies hath he allured me; by how many gracious Promi&s;es hath he in|vited me; by how much of his Goodne&s;s provoked me to for&s;ake my Sins, and to turn to him? But I have flown in the Face of his <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> and BLESSED SPIRIT, and re|jected all Terms of Reconciliation. If I had lien in a Dungeon, and been plagued with Torments all my Life-Time, yea, though I could have had another World full of Mi&s;e|ries to live in; I &s;hould count it infinite Mercy, &s;o the Lord would pa&s;s by my &s;inful Mi&s;carriages, and pardon the&s;e inward In|&s;urrections.</P>
<P>But that GOD &s;hould &s;end his deare&s;t SON to love me, and that &s;o incomparably, and &s;o unconceivably as that I could not po&s;&s;ibly hate him &s;o much, as he loved and affected me; that I could not &s;o exceed in Unkind|ne&s;s towards him, as he hath exceeded in ten|der Kindne&s;s towards me; What a Love is this? What Unkindne&s;s for &s;o great Love? Were it not righteous with GOD, never to &s;peak Comfort more to my Soul, that have &s;o
<PB N="87" REF="005214_0102_1016E630B8A743F0">
lightly e&s;teemed his Promi&s;e, and &s;weet word of Comfort? Had it not been ju&s;t with him now to take all this (as he well might) for an Advantage again&s;t me?

And as ju&s;t that I who have &s;o much loved Corruption, &s;hould have reaped the bitter Fruit of it, long e're this? But that the LORD &s;hould find an Enemy, and not &s;lay him; nay, that he &s;hould give his be|loved SON out of his own Bo&s;om to &s;ave him, is a Love not to be expre&s;&s;ed. O the <HI>Height</HI> of this Mercy, beyond all De&s;ire or Tho't! Oh the <HI>Breadth</HI> of this Mercy, a Breadth without any Bounds!

in it's Way of coming to the <HI>Promi&s;e;</HI> this Labour would be a Work of great Gain, and u&s;her in the <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> it &s;elf.

<P N="2">2.

<P N="3">3. The <HI>third Rule</HI> in this <HI>&s;econd</HI> of <HI>Means,</HI> is this: Labour to acquaint thy Heart with <HI>that Good</HI> which the Promi&s;e promi&s;eth: And this, before carnal Rea&s;on comes and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es thy Heart. Remember here that the Promi&s;e is mo&s;t &s;ure, and will come when it &s;hall be mo&s;t &s;ea&s;onable, and be&s;t for thee, and when God &s;ees it mo&s;t fit; for then, we &s;hall mo&s;t certainly have it.

<P N="2">II. In the next Place, we are to <HI>&s;it</HI> Faith for the <HI>Service;</HI> that it may &s;ucceed with more Comfort and better Speed. Tho' a Man be a Believer, yet there is a great deal of Dullne&s;s and Bluntne&s;s comes upon this Grace, tho' he have it.

It's with the <HI>Hand</HI> of <HI>Faith,</HI> as it is with the <HI>Hand</HI> of the <HI>Body;</HI> if it be nummed, &s;tiff, or frozen, a Man mu&s;t rub it, or warm it, before he can hold any thing; &s;o it is with the <HI>Hand</HI> of <HI>Faith,</HI> for <HI>Faith is the Hand of the Soul,</HI> it takes hold of that Mercy which GOD hath provided for us in

CHRIST JESUS. Now <HI>Faith</HI> is &s;ometimes numm'd and &s;tiff thro' Carele&s;ne&s;s and Loo&s;e|ne&s;s; therefore it's not enough for a Man to have <HI>Faith,</HI> but he mu&s;t &s;upple and oil the <HI>Sinews</HI> of <HI>Faith,</HI> that he may more freely take hold of the <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> of Life, and receive Comfort from thence. And that this may be done, we mu&s;t,</P>
<P N="1">1. Fir&s;t, Maintain the <HI>Evidence</HI> of <HI>Faith</HI> once gotten: With que&s;tion undeniable, this Grace of <HI>Faith</HI> once gotten, is to be main|tained&punc; Mark it, I &s;peak not of tho&s;e that have not Faith; it is in vain to bid a Man live by Faith, who hath none: But it's for tho&s;e in who&s;e Hearts GOD hath been plea&s;ed to work this ble&s;&s;ed Grace: This mu&s;t be the Care of tho&s;e that have gotten <HI>Faith;</HI> they mu&s;t know the <HI>Nature</HI> of <HI>Faith</HI> in <HI>general,</HI> and of <HI>this Faith</HI> in <HI>particular,</HI> whether it be of that Faith which <HI>Peter</HI> &s;peaks of; for there is a great deal of Copper-Faith in the World.

Now when thou ha&s;t gained <HI>Evidence</HI> that thou ha&s;t <HI>Faith,</HI> then fill it up, and keep it by thee, and labour to make the Demon&s;tration of it &s;o plain to thy Soul, that it may be undeniable. What a great Folly is it for a Man to que&s;tion, when he &s;hould u&s;e it? The Work mu&s;t needs be much hindred, tho' he have never &s;o much <HI>Faith,</HI> when he begins to cavil with

it, and to que&s;tion whether it be good or no. It's a proverbial Speech; <HI>He that doubts of his Way, mi&s;&s;eth his Way;</HI> for while he is doubting, he goes no Way in Conclu&s;ion: So he that que&s;tions whether he hath Faith or no, gets little good at pre&s;ent by it. Tell a poor Sinner of living by Faith, and he &s;ays, It's good News if he had it. 'Tis poor Com|fort to bid a Man go warm him when he hath no Fire; &s;o it's poor Comfort to bid a Man live by that which he never had. Quar|relling and Doubting when a Man hath it, hinders the U&s;e and Benefit of Faith: Here is a Man that is quarrelling about it, when he &s;hould live on it. <HI>Mat.</HI> 14.22,&mdash;31. When the Di&s;ciples &s;aw JESUS walking on the Sea, they tho't it was <HI>a Spirit;</HI> but JE|SUS &s;aid unto them, <HI>Be of good Comfort, it is I:</HI> Now when <HI>Peter</HI> knew it was CHRIST, being &s;omewhat too venturous, he &s;aid, <HI>If it be thou, Lord, bid me come unto thee on the Wa|ter;</HI> and CHRIST &s;aid, <HI>Come;</HI> and <HI>Peter</HI> going, the Water began to be boi&s;terous, his Heart began to &s;ink, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and CHRIST &s;aid unto him, <HI>O thou of little Faith, why do&s;t thou Doubt?</HI> As if he had &s;aid, <HI>It's now no Time of Doubting, but a Time of Believing.</HI> The LORD bid him come, and he had Ground enough to come, and &s;trength of Faith to come; but when he &s;aw the Waves great and trouble&s;ome, in&s;tead of Believing, he fell

a Que&s;tioning and Quarrelling with the Pro|mi&s;e. As it is with a foul ru&s;ty Mu&s;ket; &s;hoot &s;uch a one off, and it will recoil. When Faith grows ru&s;ty with Doubting, we &s;it down di&s;may'd and un&s;ettled; the very Que&s;tioning and Quarrelling again&s;t the <HI>Work</HI> of Faith, many Times doth as much di&s;able a Man to put forth the <HI>Power</HI> of Faith, as if he had no Faith at all.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Secondly,</HI> When thou ha&s;t maintained the Clearne&s;s of the Work of Grace before gained, then labour to bring thy Heart to marvellous <HI>Stillne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Calmne&s;s</HI> from Time to Time. <HI>Stayedne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Stillne&s;s</HI> of the Soul, frames the Heart to hold the Shield &s;teadily, and bear off the Blow comfortably when it comes.

When it was told the Di&s;ciples, <HI>Luke</HI> 24.41. that CHRIST was ri&s;en from the Dead, and had manife&s;ted him&s;elf to them; the Text &s;aith,
<PB N="108" REF="005214_0123_1016E66C293DF7D8">
<HI>They believed not, and wondered:</HI> They would not believe for a while; and it was thro' the Violence of their Joy, which made them they had no Lei&s;ure to believe. As it's true of <HI>moderate Affection,</HI> &s;o it's true of <HI>&s;trong Fear,</HI> and Cares and Di&s;tempers; becau&s;e the&s;e hurry the Soul violently, and tran&s;port it &s;o, that he cannot believe.

There <HI>David</HI> chides his Heart in P&s;alm 42.5, 11. and 43.5. even rocks it a&s;leep, and would bring it quiet, &s;aying, <HI>Why art thou &s;o di&s;quieted, O my Soul, why art thou di&s;quieted within me?</HI> &amp;c. There are three Things fit our Purpo&s;e in this Text.</P>
<P N="1">1. That a tumultuous Di&s;temper of Heart makes a Man lie flat upon his Back, as 'twere, and &s;ink into a Swound.</P>
<P N="2">2. It hinders the Work of Faith. Mark what follows: <HI>Hope thou in God.</HI> As if he

had &s;aid, Leave tho&s;e Di&s;tempers of Heart, and re&s;t upon the Freene&s;s of GOD'S Grace.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>David</HI> yet looks up to GOD for Mercy: <HI>For he is</HI> yet <HI>my God.</HI> The virtue of this Rule we find by Experience; e&s;pecially in melan|choly Per&s;ons, when they have &s;warms of Thoughts buzzing in their Minds; Some|times re&s;tle&s;s Fears, that do cha&s;e their Hearts, as the Hound does the Deer in the Fore&s;t; and after this comes another Affection, and after that another; and &s;o at la&s;t they come all together: Sometimes the Horror of a Man's Con&s;cience makes Hue and Cry after him, and makes him &s;ay, <Q>Oh how my Heart &s;mites me! Methought I &s;aw Hell gaping for me, and the Devil even &s;tand|ing at my Elbow, ready to carry me down to everla&s;ting De&s;truction:</Q> This makes his Soul to have &s;uch an Amazement and Ga&s;tline&s;s of Spirit, that he cannot reach the <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> of GOD.

<P N="3">3. A <HI>third Rule</HI> how Faith may be <HI>fitted</HI> for the <HI>Work:</HI> Take notice of this; In the <HI>Want</HI> of any <HI>Means,</HI> do <HI>not fir&s;t &s;eek</HI> for them; and in the <HI>Pre&s;ence</HI> of any <HI>Means</HI> GOD affords,
<PB N="110" REF="005214_0125_1016E66ED3F36430">
<HI>look not fir&s;t</HI> to them for Succour and Supply, but <HI>fir&s;t</HI> go to the <HI>Promi&s;e,</HI> that it may &s;upply what you need, and that the <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> may ble&s;s what Means you have. It is an uncomfor|table and di&s;orderly Cour&s;e, for a Man barely and fir&s;tly to look at tho&s;e Things which are within the Compa&s;s of Sen&s;e, and &s;o range up and down in the U&s;e of the Means, when the <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> and CHRIST are the la&s;t Tho't of in our Hearts. As for In&s;tance: In a Time of Poverty, how doth the Soul unfit it &s;elf for the <HI>Promi&s;e?</HI> When a Man &s;ees his E&s;tate low, and he is like to come to Mi&s;ery, he &s;aith, <Q>I have &s;ome good Friends that will not &s;ee me Want, I have &s;o much Means left yet, and I have my Health and Strength, and I hope to get a poor Living.</Q> Not one Word all this while of a <HI>Promi&s;e:</HI> But what &s;ay you to this? If Death take away all thy Friends, Sickne&s;s take away thy Health and Strength, Fire or Thieves take away all thy Goods, whither wilt thou now go? Why then at a dead Lift, as we commonly &s;ay, he is fain to go to that <HI>Mercy</HI> which <HI>endureth for ever.</HI> Oh Friend, are you there now? Why came you not thither at fir&s;t? Well, &s;ince thou art come, rea&s;on thus: I am like to be poor, and my Friends may die, and Thieves may rob me of all my Goods, but <HI>the Mercy of the Lord endureth for ever.</HI> So a <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> that is faithful, de&s;ires to preach
<PB N="111" REF="005214_0126_1016E61BD4BE97B8">
fruitfully, and to the Benefit of the Congre|gation; and then we catch at the Helps that are near at Hand, and we go to our Books and Studies, our Wits and Pains, and think the&s;e will do the Deed. We do well in all this; but the Fault is in the <HI>Order</HI> of doing them. Haply GOD knocks off Man's Wheels, and a Man is not able to come to the Bottom of the Point; and if he be able to compa&s;s the Truth in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, yet GOD bla&s;ts all he doth, and there is no good comes to the Souls of his People; at la&s;t he is fain to go to the <HI>Promi&s;e;</HI> and then the poor Mini&s;ter &s;aith, <Q>LORD, thou ha&s;t &s;aid thou wilt <HI>be with</HI> thy faithful Mini&s;ters <HI>to the end of the World;</HI> Little Strength there is in us; but be thou with us LORD:</Q> Now the Work goes on again. The <HI>Trade&s;man</HI> is hone&s;t and pain|ful, and he hopes to campa&s;s a good E&s;tate by his Calling; his Stock is good and great, and his Skill is &s;ufficient, and his Pennyworth &s;hall be as rea&s;onable as any others, and his Acquain|tance are many: Then GOD bla&s;ts all the&s;e, and then he comes to the <HI>Promi&s;e,</HI> as in P&s;al. 1.3. <HI>What&s;oever the Righteous doth, it &s;hall pro&s;per:</HI> Hold here now, and &s;ay, I expect all from the <HI>Promi&s;e,</HI> Mercy and Succour from the <HI>Promi&s;e.</HI> This was the cour&s;e that <HI>Jacob</HI> took, <HI>Gen.</HI> 32.9. fir&s;t he wre&s;tled with GOD and overcame him; then he wre&s;tled with his Brother <HI>E&s;au,</HI> and &s;aith, <HI>O God of my Father</HI>

<P N="3">III. Now for the <HI>Ordering</HI> of Faith in the <HI>Work;</HI> there are two Things to be attended to.</P>
<P N="1">1. How the Soul &s;hould <HI>get to</HI> the <HI>Pro|mi&s;es.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. How the Soul &s;hould <HI>take, receive,</HI> and <HI>improve this Sufficiency</HI> and <HI>Excellency</HI> that is in GOD, thro' CHRIST and the <HI>Promi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1.] How the Soul &s;hould <HI>get to</HI> the <HI>Pro|mi&s;e:</HI> You &s;ee all is ready, the Way open, and Faith is fitted; there are <HI>three Rules</HI> to be ob&s;erved, how the Soul may <HI>get to</HI> the Pro|mi&s;e.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="113" REF="005214_0128_1016E64354137720">1. Throw off all Power and Ability in thy &s;elf. <HI>Neverthele&s;s,</HI> &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, <HI>I live; yet not I, but Chri&s;t liveth in me,</HI> Gal. 2.20. It is not I that live by any Power of my &s;elf, but CHRIST liveth in me. It was CHRIST'S quickning, reviving, and enabling, tho' he had Faith. <HI>I know,</HI> &s;aith the Prophet, Jer. 10.23. <HI>that the Way of Man is not in him&s;elf, neither is it in Man to direct his own Steps.</HI> So do thou &s;ay, if ever thou would&s;t have thy Heart fitted to <HI>go to</HI> the Promi&s;e; &s;ay, <Q>It is not here, LORD, it is not in this vain Mind, it is not in the Power of this dead Heart, or any Pa&s;&s;age that ever I received, whereby I am able to believe in thee.</Q>
I mean the Principle of Life is not here, the Root of Faith is in the Promi&s;e, and from thence it comes into the Soul. As it is with a <HI>Mariner,</HI> when the Ship is upon the Ground in the Ebb and low Water, he doth not ex|pect to tug his Ship to the Shore by any Power of him&s;elf: So, <Q>It is not in my Wi&s;dom that can direct me, and it is not in my Weapon that can defend; it is not this Humility that can bring my Soul down; It is not here, it is not I, LORD, that can re&s;t, or go to a Promi&s;e; even all our Abilities are at a low Ebb:</Q> All that we are, or can do, is to empty our &s;elves, and fit our &s;elves, and get up the main Ma&s;t; that is, let the Soul be ready for a Promi&s;e,
<PB N="114" REF="005214_0129_1016E6730BC8E820">
and by Virtue of that be carried Heaven|ward, and Chri&s;t-ward. Take Notice of this in your own Souls, that the Heart would be|gin at home: If a Temptation come, the Heart of it &s;elf would overcome it; and if a Duty be to be done, the Heart of it &s;elf would perform it; and if Oppo&s;ition come, the Heart of it &s;elf would re&s;i&s;t it. O remember that a Man offers an injury again&s;t Rea&s;on, Sen&s;e, and Religion, and all. Now thy Faith begins to wre&s;tle with him and his dealing; and Con&s;cience checks, and thou wilt tear thy own Heart out of thine own Bo&s;om. Brethren, this will not do it: When a Ship of an hundred Ton is upon the Ground, the Mariners may pull and tug their Hearts out, ere they make her go. Oh go then and &s;ay, It is not I that can be patient, and put up a Wrong, be quiet, expect it not from hence. Let the Heart lie &s;till, till the Wind and Tide, and Promi&s;e come, and that will carry thee.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>&s;econd Rule.</HI> Bring the Promi&s;e home <HI>to thy Heart,</HI> that the Promi&s;e may bring thy Heart to it. And thus I would have you rea&s;on: The Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by the Power of his SPIRIT, is in the Promi&s;e un|deniably, and undoubtedly, and un&s;peakably accompanying in his Manner, as he &s;hall &s;ee fit. This I &s;ay, That the almighty Power of CHRIST doth really and continually ac|company the Promi&s;e for the Good of his&punc;
<PB N="115" REF="005214_0130_1016E619153BDA20">
Hence it is called, <HI>The</HI> SPIRIT <HI>of Promi&s;e;</HI> for there is an almighty creating Work goes along with the <HI>Promi&s;e.</HI> And I rea&s;on thus&punc; That Word that di&s;cerns the Thoughts of the Hearts of Men, that Word mu&s;t needs have the almighty Work of GOD'S SPIRIT accompanying of it: So far as GOD hath pro|mi&s;ed it, not when thou haply think'&s;t it fit, but when GOD &s;ees it fit. He doth it as a voluntary Workman; therefore thou con&s;i|dere&s;t that there is an almighty Power, and a Fulne&s;s in the Promi&s;e: Then lay that Pro|mi&s;e upon thy own Heart, and conclude it, and look for Virtue from thence, to draw thy Soul to it again.</P>
<P>I have &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages to expre&s;s this more fully. <HI>Jacob</HI> would not believe that <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> was alive; or if he were alive, he had but little Means, and was poor, Gen. 45.26, &mdash;29. <HI>But when he &s;aw the Chariots that</HI> Jo|&s;eph <HI>had &s;ent him, then he believed, and &s;aid, I have enough;</HI> Jo&s;eph <HI>my Son liveth.</HI> The Chariots &s;ent from <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> to <HI>Jacob,</HI> brought <HI>Jacob</HI> to <HI>Jo&s;eph.</HI> So every believing Soul is poor and feeble, and di&s;abled to go to GOD, and to believe in the LORD JESUS CHRIST: Therefore look thou unto the Chariots of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> fir&s;t, and that will convey thee to the Promi&s;e. As it is with the Miller, fir&s;t he prepares the Mill fitly, and orders all the Oc|ca&s;ions thereof; and when the Stones are fit,
<PB N="116" REF="005214_0131_1016E675C6F1F440">
and laid to go, yet it will not, till the Sluce be pulled up, and the Water run that drives the Mill: So the Soul is humbled, and lies level with the Lord and his Truth, and is content to yield to his Conditions; but now the Soul of it &s;elf, in it &s;elf cannot go, it hath not the Principle of Going; but let down the Sluce of the Promi&s;e, and let that come to thy Heart, and it will bring thy Soul home to the Lord. As Luke 19.9. <HI>This Day is Salvation come to this Hou&s;e:</HI> Not to the Walls of thy Hou&s;e, but to Men that are in thy Hou&s;e. They did not come to Salvation, but Salvation came to them. The Lord &s;ent Salvation to &s;alute the Hou&s;e of little <HI>Zaccheus.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>third Rule.</HI> When the <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> is thus come home to thee, and thou &s;ee&s;t the Sufficiency and Authority of it, then all thou ha&s;t to do is this; In the <HI>Stream</HI> of that <HI>Pro|mi&s;e,</HI> be carried home to the <HI>Promi&s;e.</HI> The Prodigal, <HI>Luke</HI> 15. is &s;aid to be like a <HI>lo&s;t Sheep.</HI> (Mark this, for it concerns you, poor Creatures.) The poor Sheep is wander|ing up and down, now in the Mouth of the Lion, and then in the Briars, and &s;ometimes in the Pit. The Text &s;aith, <HI>He leaveth ninety nine to &s;eek that;</HI> That is, in compari&s;on of what care he expre&s;&s;eth to the lo&s;t Sheep; he leaveth a Man regenerate not carele&s;ly, but he will not expre&s;s &s;o great Love as to a poor lo&s;t Man; And tho' thou can&s;t not find the way
<PB N="117" REF="005214_0132_1016E64668B6DDE8">
to Heaven, yet he will find it for thee; lie thou upon the Shoulders of JESUS CHRIST. When thou finde&s;t thy Heart feeble and weak and thy &s;elf unable to believe; then the LORD JESUS CHRIST brings THE SPIRIT of Grace, and that comes to &s;eek, and JESUS CHRIST lays that Soul of thine upon his Shoulders, that is, upon the Riches of the Free|ne&s;s of his Grace: Therefore let thy Heart be tran&s;ported by the Power of that Grace, and by the Virtue of that Mercy which GOD hath made known to thee for thy everla&s;ting good. When the Chariots are come, get up into them. The LORD JESUS CHRIST is gone up to Heaven, and hath &s;ent the&s;e Cha|riots for thee; therefore get thee up, and &s;ay, "LORD, take me up with thee."

trading with a quick Stock. As it is in the World with Temporals, even &s;o it is in our Spiritual E&s;tate. Tho' a Man have a little for the pre&s;ent, yet if he have &s;ome <HI>old Rever|&s;ions</HI> to come, it will refre&s;h his Heart, and bear him up in time of Poverty and Mi&s;ery; and he &s;aith, If he can make but a &s;crambling Shift for a while, for &s;o long time, then he hopes to live as well as any Man in the Coun|try.

As <HI>old Rents</HI> of Farms that were let long ago, when the Lea&s;es come out, they are worth treble the Rent they were let for at the fir&s;t: So there are old Rents of Comfort and Mercy; as, <HI>Come ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you.</HI> Then no more Tears, no more Trouble, no more Sorrow, no more Sin.

<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> But &s;ome will &s;ay, <HI>How may a Man</HI> expect THAT <HI>from the</HI> PROMISE, <HI>which</HI> GOD intends, <HI>and will undoubtedly</HI> be&s;tow?</P>
<P>For <HI>An&s;wer</HI> hereunto, I will &s;hew WHAT <HI>thou</HI> may'&s;t <HI>expect,</HI> and WHAT GOD will un|doubtedly <HI>be&s;tow.</HI> If thou do&s;t believe, <HI>Hea|ven and Salvation</HI> are certainly thine, and <HI>Per|&s;everance</HI> to the End, and <HI>that Manner and Mea&s;ure of A&s;&s;i&s;tance,</HI> that may make thee fit for Per&s;everance: The&s;e <HI>three Things</HI> grow here. But for <HI>temporal Ble&s;&s;ings</HI> which we de|&s;ire, and <HI>that Mea&s;ure</HI> of <HI>&s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings</HI> which we would have; &s;o much Grace, and &s;o much A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and &s;o much Abilities to do Duties; God doth not engage him&s;elf to be&s;tow the&s;e. But that which God engageth him&s;elf to be&s;tow, both for temporal and &s;pi|ritual Ble&s;&s;ings, it may be di&s;covered in <HI>the&s;e three Particulars:</HI> So much Grace and A&s;&s;u|rance of God's Love, and &s;o much Comfort in Grace as he &s;ees fit for thee, after his own Order, and in his own Time. I will open
<PB N="121" REF="005214_0136_1016E61600EAAA38">
them all, becau&s;e many do here bungle won|derfully.</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>Fir&s;t;</HI> He will be&s;tow them <HI>in his own Order,</HI> not thy Order. Fir&s;t, He will make thee fit, and make thee good, that thou may'&s;t be able to dige&s;t them, and then he will be&s;tow them on thee. Haply a poor Man is driven to de&s;perate Hazard, and is brought mi&s;erably under, and therefore the Heart cries earne&s;tly for &s;ome more <HI>Supply;</HI> and he calls and GOD an&s;wers not; and he labours to look up to the <HI>Promi&s;e,</HI> where GOD &s;aith, <HI>Nothing &s;hall be wanting to him,</HI> and yet it cometh not. I &s;ay, GOD will give the&s;e in his own Order-Fir&s;t, GOD will make thee fit for this E&s;tate, and then give it. I never knew a good Man de&s;perately poor, but his Heart was de&s;perate|ly proud; therefore the Lord will make him good, and make his proud Heart yield, and then be&s;tow the&s;e Things: Look for that fir&s;t, and then for the other.</P>
<P>Again, Another Chri&s;tian labours exceeding|ly for the <HI>A&s;&s;urance</HI> of GOD'S Love, and can|not obtain it; and &s;eeks to GOD in the U&s;e of the <HI>Promi&s;es,</HI> and yet he cannot find it &s;etled. Well, GOD will give thee Comfort and Con|&s;olation, but <HI>in his own Order.</HI> And know this, that commonly the Lord never debars the Soul of Comfort, but he &s;ees the Heart is not fit for it. Thy Heart would be proud and carele&s;s, and GOD would hear no more of
<PB N="122" REF="005214_0137_1016E67DDB907CF0">
thee, and thy Sail would overturn the Boat; therefore when God has aba&s;ed thy Heart, and made thee content to want what he &s;hall deny, then he will give thee A&s;&s;urance, but it mu&s;t be <HI>in his own Order.</HI> And this is the Rea&s;on why the mo&s;t &s;moak out their Days in Di&s;content; the Rea&s;on is, There is a <HI>proud Heart</HI> and a &s;turdy Di&s;po&s;ition of Spirit that will not come unto God's Terms. As it is with a Phy&s;ician; he will not give a Cordial to his Patient, when he will: For if he were in a burning Fever, it were the next Way to &s;end him going; but fir&s;t he purges him, and makes him fit, and then gives him a Cordial: So it is in the&s;e Things which thou crave&s;t; the Lord will give thee them, when thou &s;halt not &s;urfeit of Comfort, and A&s;&s;urance, and Pro&s;perity; and when thy Heart is emptied and purged, and able to dige&s;t the&s;e Things, then the Lord will give them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Secondly;</HI> The Lord will give us tem|poral Ble&s;&s;ings, and <HI>that Mea&s;ure</HI> of <HI>Spiritual,</HI> in his <HI>own due Time;</HI> not when thou and I would, but when he &s;ees mo&s;t fit; as <HI>John</HI> 2. 3, 4.

Mine Hour is not yet come.</HI> So it is with our Souls; we want Comfort, and we want Strength again&s;t our Corruptions, and we
<PB N="123" REF="005214_0138_1016E64D14E716E8">
want A&s;&s;urance, and A&s;&s;i&s;tance: But what have I to do with that proud Heart, &s;ays our Saviour? <HI>My</HI> Time <HI>is not yet come.</HI> You would have it <HI>now,</HI> as they &s;aid, Acts 1.6. <HI>Lord, wilt thou</HI> NOW <HI>re&s;tore the Kingdom to</HI> I&s;rael? GOD will do <HI>in his own Time,</HI> and we mu&s;t wait his Lei&s;ure. This is one Thing that doth nece&s;&s;arily accompany the Covenant of Grace, as I have &s;hewed before that the Lord &s;hould di&s;pen&s;e the Ble&s;&s;ings of his King|dom when HE plea&s;eth, and not when we will. When the Lord &s;ees the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings of &s;piritual Mercies and temporal Favours are ripe and mo&s;t &s;ea&s;onable to thy Nece&s;&s;ity; then thou &s;halt have them: But <HI>the Time</HI> is in GOD'S Hand.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Thirdly;</HI> The Lord doth <HI>not</HI> promi&s;e in <HI>&s;uch a Manner</HI> and <HI>Mea&s;ure,</HI> and <HI>&s;uch a peculi|ar Thing,</HI> to give that temporal Ble&s;&s;ing, and that &s;piritual A&s;&s;i&s;tance we de&s;ire; but the Lord will do <HI>that which he knows mo&s;t fit:</HI> For &s;o the Text &s;ays, Prov. 30.8. <HI>Feed me with Food convenient for me.</HI> There was <HI>Faith</HI> now; he wholly refers him&s;elf to God, When a Man comes to the Taylor to have a Garment made, he doth not cut out the Garment him|&s;elf, but refers it to the Judgment of the Workman.

As it is with a Potter, he is minded to make &s;o many Ve&s;&s;els of Honour: So if the Lord will make thee a Ve&s;&s;el of Honour, go away con|tented; whether thou ha&s;t &s;o much Pro&s;peri|ty, and &s;o much Good, or no, and &s;o much Grace, it matters not &s;o much; it is enough that thou art elected to eternal Happine&s;s.</P>

<P N="2">[2.] Again, <HI>Another Particular</HI> in this third Rule of <HI>living by Faith,</HI> is this; <HI>How to take, and how to enjoy the Sap and Sweet of the Promi&s;e, and to live by it.</HI> When the Hu&s;|bandman hath &s;own his Ground, and his Fruit is ripe, and he hath reaped it, then he mu&s;t gather in his Corn that he may live upon it.

For this End, let me &s;ugge&s;t the&s;e <HI>five Directions.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Fir&s;t:</HI> Thou &s;ee&s;t <HI>what</HI> GOD <HI>is</HI> in the Promi&s;e, and thou expecte&s;t no more than GOD is there: Then, eye <HI>that particular Good</HI> in the Promi&s;e which thou &s;tande&s;t in need of; eye that Good in Chri&s;t and in the Promi&s;e, and then &s;et God's Power and Faithfulne&s;s a|work to bring that Good, and his Wi&s;dom to continue it. As for <HI>In&s;tance:</HI> I am in Per|&s;ecution,
<PB N="125" REF="005214_0140_1016E614732B1730">
and either I would have Deliverance and Safety, that I might not be impri&s;oned; or el&s;e Comfort and Refre&s;hment, if the Lord carry me thither; and therefore I would &s;ee all this in the Promi&s;e, &s;till re&s;erving the Con|ditions before-mentioned. If thou art in Pri|&s;on, eye Liberty and Pre&s;ervation in Chri&s;t; he that is the great Deliverer of his People, and carrieth his People in his own Hands: And then &s;et God's Power and Faithfulne&s;s a-work, that can do it; and his Wi&s;dom, that can continue it for thy Good. That which thou &s;ee&s;t and neede&s;t in the Promi&s;e, that the Power and Wi&s;dom of God may com|municate to thy Soul. This is the Meaning of that Place, P&s;al. 37.5. <HI>Commit thy Ways unto the Lord, tru&s;t in him, and he &s;hall bring it to pa&s;s.</HI> Roul thy &s;elf, and lay all thy Occa|&s;ions upon the Lord: Therefore the Apo&s;tle &s;aith, 1 Pet. 5.7. <HI>Ca&s;t your Care upon the Lord, for he careth for you.</HI> It is God's proper Office and Work: He careth for thy Soul, therefore lay it all upon him, and put over all thy Care into his Hands, and &s;et his Power and Faith|fulne&s;s a-work: Only this is here a little to be &s;canned. I &s;peak not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hould take no Care at all, but I &s;ay, Hang all the Weight and Burden upon the Lord. The Brewer, he tumbles the Barrel of Beer, and he rouls it, but it's the Earth that bears it: So whatever Trouble is in thine Eye, or Ear, or
<PB N="126" REF="005214_0141_1016E684D3EDD268">
Heart, roul it upon the Lord. That is thus: The <HI>Weight</HI> of a Man lies e&s;pecially in <HI>three Things,</HI> which a Man mu&s;t hurl off him&s;elf and lay upon the Lord. Either <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> A Man &s;hall not be able to <HI>know</HI> what he &s;hall do, or what he is commanded: Or el&s;e, <HI>Secondly,</HI> He &s;hall not be able to <HI>do</HI> what God com|mands, and he knows: Or el&s;e, <HI>Thirdly,</HI> He &s;hall not find <HI>Succe&s;s</HI> in what he doth. It is not a Trouble to do what we can, or to em|ploy our &s;elves as we are able: But this is the Trouble, when the Heart &s;aith, <Q>I <HI>know not</HI> what the Mind of God is; or, I &s;hall <HI>not do</HI> what I know; or, It will <HI>not &s;ucceed;</HI> or, No, it is not in <HI>my Power.</HI></Q> Now leave all the&s;e with God, and meddle not with them, but put them over to the Lord, and meddle with thine own Duty, and thine own Work; and let God alone with his: And &s;ay thou un|to the Lord, <Q>In truth, Lord, it is not in my Power, it is not in my Parts or Work, ei|ther to compa&s;s that Wi&s;dom, that is able to direct my &s;elf, or to have any Power to do all that is commanded, much le&s;s to give good Succe&s;s. Lord, I will not meddle with that, but leave it with thy Maje&s;ty: If thou in thy Power can&s;t not, nor in thy Faithfulne&s;s and Goodne&s;s care&s;t not for thy poor helple&s;s Creature, then I am content: And if thou wilt not be faithful, then I am content to be mi&s;erable.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="005214_0142_1016E64E9DAD5210">And &s;o al&s;o thou maye&s;t &s;uppo&s;e a Man that hath promi&s;ed to undertake &s;ome Bu&s;ine&s;s for a Friend, and in the End it proves &s;omewhat trouble&s;ome, and therefore he wi&s;hes his Friend to take it again into his own Hands; for it is very trouble&s;ome: But a Man will leave it to him, and &s;ay, He hath engaged him&s;elf to do it, and he will not look after it; I will not meddle with it any more. So whatever it is that is in God's royal <HI>Preroga|tive,</HI> leave it with God, and do not meddle with it; let God now look to it; leave it to his Faithfulne&s;s and Power to accompli&s;h it.

<P N="2">2. <HI>Secondly;</HI> By <HI>Faith</HI> go to the <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> again for <HI>Help</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> to wait on God in that Way, and to look towards God in the U&s;e of tho&s;e Means, he hath appointed for the attaining of that Good which his Power will work for thee. God will certainly work it: And &s;o thou mu&s;t meet God in the Cour&s;e of his Providence, in the Improvement of the Means he hath appointed for thy Good. Ob|&s;erve thou his Providence, and do thou what God requires: For otherwi&s;e we live not by <HI>Faith,</HI> but tempt God, and throw away the Promi&s;e and all, and deprive our &s;elves of that Good which God would be&s;tow; we not walking in that Way which he hath ap|pointed. <HI>Luke</HI> 24.49. when our Saviour was to go to Heaven, he &s;aid, <HI>Behold, I &s;end the</HI> PROMISE <HI>of my</HI> FATHER <HI>among&s;t you: But tarry you in the City of</HI> Jeru&s;alem, <HI>until you be indued with Power from above.</HI> Chri&s;t would indue them with the SPIRIT; but they mu&s;t tarry at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> and wait for it. So I &s;ay, Would'&s;t thou have Grace and the SPIRIT from above, and the Wealth of the
<PB N="129" REF="005214_0144_1016E611D74C1C80">

Then walk in that Way God hath appointed: Stay at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and be in the Way, and meet God in his Providence; and then thou &s;halt receive from his Power and Faithfulne&s;s what thou neede&s;t. Thou would&s;t have God ble&s;s thee in thine E&s;tate, and yet thou would&s;t be idle and carele&s;s: But this will not do the Deed: God would give thee a Ble&s;&s;ing, but thou art not there to take it. <HI>This is the Excellency of the Promi&s;es of God; as they require Conditions before they be|&s;tow Mercies; &s;o they make us able to be Par|takers of the Conditions, and give the Conditions:</HI> As for <HI>Example, Ezek.</HI> 36. the Lord in the former Part of the Chapter promi&s;eth to give them many Things; but how? It mu&s;t be by Prayer, and humbling them&s;elves before him: He will give thee a Family Ble&s;&s;ing, by Prayer in it; and a Ble&s;&s;ing in private, by Prayer in private; and Strength again&s;t Sin, and Power again&s;t Corruption: But I will be &s;ought unto for all the&s;e, &s;aith the Lord: And the Text &s;aith, Prov. 20.7. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed is the Man that walketh in his Integrity, and his Children after him.</HI> Therefore walk thou in the Integrity of thine Heart; that's the Con|dition of a Chri&s;tian in General; or as a Hu&s;band, or as a Wife, or as a Servant, in the Particular. This the Promi&s;e requires. But mark this now: The &s;ame Promi&s;e that requireth the Conditions, will help us to per|form
<PB N="130" REF="005214_0145_1016E68939930F38">
form the Conditions: And the &s;ame Lord that &s;aith, <HI>I will be entreated and &s;ought to for the&s;e;</HI> the &s;ame Lord &s;aith, P&s;al. 10.17. <HI>He prepareth their Hearts to pray.</HI> Go thou there|fore to God to help thee to pray, that he may be&s;tow his Ble&s;&s;ing upon thee, which he hath promi&s;ed, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 26.27. he will fir&s;t give them a <HI>new Heart,</HI> then <HI>teach them to walk in his Ways.</HI> So if thou wilt walk in his Ways, thou &s;halt have his Ble&s;&s;ings: Therefore go thou by the Power of Faith, to the Promi&s;es of God, for <HI>Strength</HI> and <HI>Grace,</HI> and in that thou mu&s;t u&s;e the <HI>Means</HI> appointed; and then expect a Ble&s;&s;ing from it in the Cour&s;e of his Providence. Now is God's Power and Faithfulne&s;s &s;et a-work.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>third Direction.</HI> We mu&s;t &s;et it down, and conclude it, that God <HI>will do it;</HI> &s;o &s;hall we receive in the Ways of his Pro|vidence what&s;oever he hath promi&s;ed to give. That is the Work of Faith, and that is to draw Sap and Virtue from the Promi&s;e, John 3.33. <HI>He that hath received his Te&s;timony, hath &s;et to his Seal that God is True.</HI> There, by <HI>Sealing,</HI> is meant &s;ealing to the Promi&s;e. This is the Nature of <HI>Sealing;</HI> when a Man hath drawn the Articles of Agreement, and when they have &s;ealed, the whole Matter is done. So Faith mu&s;t make the Promi&s;e au|thentical, and put a Seal to it that it is true; and &s;aith, <Q>It is done in Heaven, and I am

fully re&s;olved, and &s;etledly per&s;waded thereof, that I &s;hall have whatever I have believed; and Thou, LORD, ha&s;t pro|mi&s;ed, and I have u&s;ed the Means in the Ways of thy Providence.</Q> Famous is that of <HI>Abraham, Gen.</HI> 22.5. The Lord hath bidden him &s;acrifice his Son, and yet had &s;aid before he &s;hould live: And there|fore when he came to the Place, he &s;aid to his Servants, <HI>Abide you here with the A&s;&s;es; for I and the Lad will go yonder, and &s;acrifice, and return again to you.</HI> He thought to &s;acri|fice him, and yet by <HI>Faith</HI> he believed that he &s;hould bring <HI>I&s;aac</HI> again.

When thou finde&s;t thy Comforts like <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s in the A&s;hes, and thy E&s;tate helple&s;s and hope|le&s;s; yet even then &s;et God's Power a-work, and wait upon him in the U&s;e of the Means he hath appointed, and there conclude it, and that He will bring Patience, Power, and De|liverance, and &s;o in every Kind, according to all Nece&s;&s;ities. Yet remember this, Ex|pect no more from the Promi&s;e, than God will give in the Promi&s;e: But &s;ay, <Q>My Sins &s;hall be ma&s;ter'd one Day, and the&s;e Temptations &s;hall one Day be overthrown, that have &s;o long annoyed the Soul of thy Servant; I have begged Succour a|gain&s;t the&s;e Corruptions within, and the&s;e Temptations without, and yet it is not;

but I know it's done in Heaven; it wants nothing but the taking out; Thou wilt be&s;tow upon thy Servant what thou &s;ee&s;t fit.</Q> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 1.18. <HI>Hannah</HI> wept &s;ore, and prayed to the Lord, and went a|way, and was no more &s;orrowful: And &s;he &s;aid, <Q>Lord, I believe that I &s;hall either have a Child, or that which is as good, or better:</Q> Now the Bu&s;ine&s;s was done.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e the Lord delays, and does not &s;uddenly accompli&s;h what he intends, and thou ha&s;t u&s;ed Means to receive; he gives not, grants not, &s;ends not Succour according to thy De&s;ire, and the Tenor of the Cove|nant, <HI>as thou conceive&s;t;</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Then in the <HI>fourth Place,</HI> FAITH is to take up it's Stand, and <HI>&s;tay till it come:</HI> As thou re&s;olve&s;t, &s;o it will be: Stay 'till it be, and &s;tay it out. Here is much Work to do. We prevent God's Kindne&s;s, when we go a|way before he be willing to be&s;tow a Kindne&s;s on us. But Faith will not do &s;o: He that believes, does not make ha&s;te: He makes ha&s;te to obey, but he &s;tays, and re&s;olves that it will be. Hab. 2.3. <HI>The Vi&s;ion is for an ap|pointed Time; but at the End it &s;hall &s;peak, and not lie;</HI> Therefore <HI>wait for it, becau&s;e it will &s;urely come.</HI> Thou art pe&s;tered with thy <HI>Sins,</HI> and ha&s;t laboured by Faith to &s;ubdue them; and thy E&s;tate is low, and thou ha&s;t laboured by Faith for Deliverance: And yet it comes
<PB N="133" REF="005214_0148_1016E60DC9CB2038">
not: Therefore &s;tay till God &s;ees fit, and it will come. P&s;al. 123.2. <HI>As the Eyes of Servants look to the Hands of their Ma&s;ters, and as the Eyes of a Maiden to the Hand of her Mi&s;tre&s;s; &s;o our Eyes wait upon the Lord our God, until he have Mercy upon us.</HI> It is not, 'till I will, or 'till I &s;ee fit, or according to my Mind; but until the Lord have Mercy. We &s;uddenly &s;lide away from the Covenant which the Lord makes with us; becau&s;e we have it not when we will, therefore we go a|way. 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 13.13. When <HI>Samuel</HI> tarried long, and the People began to murmur, <HI>Saul</HI> went and offered a Burnt-offering to the Lord: And therefore <HI>Samuel</HI> &s;aid unto him, <HI>Thou ha&s;t done fooli&s;hly, thou ha&s;t not kept the Commandment of the Lord thy God, which he commanded thee; for now would the Lord have e&s;tabli&s;hed thy Kingdom upon</HI> I&s;rael <HI>for ever.</HI> If <HI>Saul</HI> had &s;tayed the Lord's Time, HE would have e&s;ta|bli&s;hed his Kingdom upon <HI>I&s;rael</HI> for ever: But he prevented the Lord's Kindne&s;s, and offered &s;acrifice un&s;ea&s;onably and &s;infully. So it is many Times with a proud, petti&s;h, ra&s;h and di&s;tempered Heart: If we have not what we would, and when we would, then we are all amort, [<HI>i.e.</HI> quite dead-hearted,] and mur|mur, and &s;ay, Why &s;hould we wait any lon|ger? <HI>Thou ha&s;t done fooli&s;hly:</HI> Ha&s;t thou pray|ed and looked to the <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> thus long, and wilt thou now give over? The Lord would
<PB N="134" REF="005214_0149_1016E690024010A8">
have comforted thee, had&s;t thou gone on: But the Lord hath withdrawn him&s;elf from thee, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t withdrawn thy Heart from the Promi&s;e. When the Carriage is heavy, and the Way dead, there are many &s;ore Pulls, and oft the Waggon is at a Stand; and if a Man &s;hould then go away and give over, all his Work were lo&s;t. Therefore &s;tay thou 'till the Lord &s;hew Mercy. Thus long thou ha&s;t call'd and &s;ought, and look'd up to the Promi&s;e, and waited upon the Lord, and attended upon the freene&s;s of his Grace; once more haply would have done it: thy Heart was almo&s;t humbled, thy Sin was almo&s;t con|quered: Oh thou &s;illy Soul, why did&s;t not thou hold it out? It would have come at the la&s;t; my Life for thine. Now take heed of this; If the Time &s;eems tedious, and thy Heart begins to &s;ink, and thy Spirit is weary; take heed of flying off, take heed of &s;hifting for thy own Comfort, and looking to ba&s;e Ends and Aims: No, hold thy Mind to, and keep thy Eye of Faith upon the Promi&s;e, and &s;tay it out 'till God &s;ee the Time fit: And know, <HI>it's the be&s;t Time, when it's</HI> GOD'S <HI>Time.</HI> In the 27th of the <HI>Acts,</HI> ver. 31. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Ex|cept the&s;e abide in the Ship, ye cannot be &s;aved.</HI> Every Man was &s;kipping over-board to &s;ave him&s;elf, but <HI>Paul</HI> &s;tayed them. A Man would have tho't otherwi&s;e; but the Apo&s;tle knew it was not &s;o; for the Lord had reveal|ed

it to him. So I &s;ay, Be thy Temptations never &s;o &s;trong, and thy Sins never &s;o many, and thou beginne&s;t to complain, and &s;aye&s;t, <Q>I have cryed, Lord, and &s;ought earne&s;tly, and yet my Condition is wor&s;e, and my Soul more &s;inful, and I am le&s;s able to help my &s;elf, there is no more Succour to be expect|ed.</Q>
Now take heed of going out of the <HI>Ship,</HI> and from the u&s;e of Means: Keep in the <HI>Ship;</HI> for in it you &s;hall be &s;afe. Keep in the <HI>Promi&s;e,</HI> and &s;till your Hearts there: You &s;hall have a happy Arrival at Heaven, tho' it be upon a little broken Board: It's no matter, &s;tay God's Time.</P>
<P N="5">5. The <HI>fifth Direction. Lay hold</HI> on GOD in CHRIST, and <HI>wre&s;tle</HI> with him, and <HI>never let him go.</HI> For yet haply the Lord &s;eems not only to <HI>delay</HI> his poor Servants, and to with|hold his Favour; but he &s;eems to <HI>frown</HI> and &s;ay, <HI>He will not hear;</HI> and he &s;eems to be an|gry with the Prayer of his Servants, and with their Importunity; and he &s;eems as if he would not &s;uccour and &s;upply: Thus he dealt with <HI>Jacob, Gen.</HI> 32.26. There the Lord &s;ays, <HI>Let me go;</HI> I care not what becomes of thee, <HI>Let me go:</HI> But <HI>Jacob</HI> lays hold upon him, and would not let him go. So the <HI>la&s;t Work</HI> of Faith is this: <HI>In a holy Humility la|bour to contend with</HI> GOD, and by a &s;trong Hand overcome the Lord; for the Lord loves to be overcome thus. Be not &s;aucy with the
<PB N="136" REF="005214_0151_1016E695C1A4A780">
Lord: But in the Sen&s;e of thine own Ba&s;ene&s;s, as it were, catch the Lord Je&s;us, and &s;trive with him; leave not 'till thou ha&s;t tho&s;e Com|forts he hath promi&s;ed, and thou ha&s;t begged. This is the Glory and the Victory of the Tri|umph of Faith, that gives thee the Day too; and the Lord, as 'twere, lays down the Wea+pons, and yields him&s;elf as conquered: As was with <HI>Jacob,</HI> when GOD &s;aw he could not prevail, he &s;aid, Ver&s;e 28. <HI>Thy Name &s;hall no more be called</HI> Jacob, <HI>but</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>becau&s;e thou ha&s;t prevailed with God.</HI> God is ready to give what he hath promi&s;ed; but he will have us try the Ma&s;tery with him. God overcomes him&s;elf, and we by Faith in God, overcome or prevail with God: As Jam. 2.13. <HI>Mercy triumphs over Ju&s;tice.</HI> Lord, &s;aith <HI>my Soul,</HI> Why &s;hould not I have that Mercy, Supply and Succour? Saith Ju&s;tice, Thou art a &s;inful Wretch, and thou ha&s;t wronged me: Saith Anger, Thou ha&s;t de&s;erved to be plagued; and therefore thou &s;halt feel the &s;mart of my Di&s;plea&s;ure. Now <HI>Faith</HI> lays hold upon the Riches of the Freene&s;s of God's <HI>Mercy</HI> in Chri&s;t; and in him Ju&s;tice is &s;atisfied, and Anger appealed for all: And now Mercy is purcha&s;ed for all, and Mercy triumpheth over Ju&s;tice; and Faith takes hold upon and over|comes GOD him&s;elf, as I may &s;ay, with a holy humble Ba&s;ene&s;s of Heart. You know what the Lord did to the Woman of <HI>Canaan, Mat.</HI>
<PB N="137" REF="005214_0152_1016E6986CB41398">
15.28. when &s;he had &s;triven with him a great while, and would take no Denial; at la&s;t he &s;aith, <HI>O Woman, great is thy Faith, be it unto thee even as thou wilt.</HI> Take what thou wilt; if thou wilt have Life for thy Child, and Peace for thine own Con&s;cience, and Joy in the Holy Gho&s;t, take it; for it is all thine. He, as it were, turns her loo&s;e to all his Trea&s;ury. If &s;he had gone away at the fir&s;t or &s;econd De|nial, &s;he had found no Help: But becau&s;e &s;he held out, &s;he had all her Heart's De&s;ire. God would have us wre&s;tle with his Maje&s;ty, that he may be overcome in Mercy and Goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>I might have here taken &s;ome of <HI>the mo&s;t de&s;perate Ca&s;es</HI> that could be, that you might have &s;een what <HI>Faith</HI> would have done in the Mid&s;t of the <HI>Want of all Means,</HI> and in the <HI>greate&s;t Extremity</HI> that could have befallen a poor Sinner; but I pa&s;s over that at this Time.</P>
<P>Now therefore con&s;ider what hath been &s;aid: Lay the&s;e Things up, and have them ever before you, and practi&s;e them: And by often writing, learn to write: And by often living, learn to live. Many People live poorly, and make a poor Shift to go to Hea|ven: But I would not have a Chri&s;tian live &s;o, but be Ma&s;ter of his Art. Know and &s;ee your Way, and u&s;e the Means, Labour to get Good thereby; that you may have the Sap and Sweet of the Promi&s;es, and &s;o go &s;ing|ing

<HEAD>The Conclu&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>_NOW that which I conclude withal is this: You &s;ee how far the Lord hath brought us; how the Soul hath been prepared, and cut off from <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>It&s;elf,</HI> if fitted for the Lord Je&s;us, by <HI>Contrition</HI> and <HI>Humiliation;</HI> and that the Soul comes to &s;ee that there is <HI>no Hope</HI> in the <HI>Creatures,</HI> nor any Succour in Heaven, but in the <HI>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> and &s;o at la&s;t the Sin|ner comes, and lies at the <HI>Foot</HI> of the <HI>Lord Je&s;us,</HI> and knows that either he mu&s;t be ano|ther Man, or a damned Man. Now when he &s;ees that <HI>Prayer</HI> and all other <HI>Means</HI> will not profit, and the Power of the Means yet pre|vails not, and the Power of his <HI>Corruptions</HI> is not yet ma&s;tered; then he looks up to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and is contented that he &s;hould do what he will with him. Now when the Lord <HI>Je&s;us</HI> &s;ees him lie wearied thus with his Corruptions, then the Lord gives &s;pecial Notice to his Soul that it is his Purpo&s;e to do him good, and that there is Mercy for that broken Heart of his. With that <HI>Hope</HI> is &s;tirred; and <HI>Faith</HI> cries out, <Q>Is it po&s;&s;ible? Is it credible? Shall this
<PB N="139" REF="005214_0154_1016E69CA75F6438">
Wretchedne&s;s of mine be pardoned? Oh, my De&s;ire is kindled within me, and I long for that Day: O that I might once &s;ee the Funeral of all my Sins!</Q> Mark now how <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Joy</HI> are cheared to entertain this Mercy; and Oh how is the Soul bound and engaged to GOD, that offers free and unde|&s;erved Grace to a &s;tubborn and rebellious Sinner! At la&s;t the <HI>Will</HI> &s;aith <HI>Amen</HI> to the <HI>Promi&s;e;</HI> and further &s;aith, <HI>O that Mercy I will have!</HI> And thus the Soul is come home to GOD by <HI>Vocation.</HI> Now the Prodigal is come home to his Father; and the Father's Heart leaps within his Brea&s;t, when he &s;ees him lie at the Door. And as the Father rejoiceth, &s;o the Angels in Heaven rejoice; and all the Faithful &s;hall rejoice, and &s;ay, <Q>Oh my Hu&s;band, Oh my Father. Oh my Child, and Oh my Wife, that was a &s;inful Wo|man, is come home again to her fir&s;t and be&s;t Hu&s;band.</Q> You that have found it thus in your &s;elves, be comforted: You that know it in others, rejoice.</P>
<P>To <HI>&s;um up all</HI> briefly, we &s;ee,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t;</HI> When we have <HI>pluck'd away all carnal Props,</HI> that then there is Way made for the <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> to come in to us.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly;</HI> And when our Hearts are po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed thoro'ly of the <HI>Sufficiency</HI> of GOD'S <HI>Pro|mi&s;e</HI> and <HI>Grace;</HI> that then the <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> that draws near, begins it's Work.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="005214_0155_1016E69E2F6D5798"><HI>Thirdly;</HI> That when we <HI>expect</HI> all from the <HI>Promi&s;e,</HI> even Power to come to it, that then It lays fa&s;t hold upon us.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly;</HI> That when we are <HI>content to yield</HI> to the <HI>ju&s;t Conditions</HI> of the <HI>Promi&s;e,</HI> then the <HI>Promi&s;e</HI> carries us, and all in us.</P>
<P>Thus we have &s;een the <HI>Hindrances</HI> removed, and the <HI>Means</HI> propounded: And hence we &s;ee, that <HI>Faith</HI> is to be laboured for above all Graces. And now that we may be moved and per&s;waded importunately to &s;eek after this ble&s;&s;ed Grace of God; let us further con&s;ider thus much, namely, that <HI>if we once get this Grace, we get all other Graces with it;</HI> which is a Ground of much Comfort, and cannot but keep us doing: For will it not much encourage a Man, when in the doing of <HI>one</HI> Work he knows he &s;hall do <HI>another,</HI> nay, <HI>all</HI> his Work with one Labour! But &s;o it is in the Work of <HI>Faith.</HI> Oh then how &s;hould it encourage us to labour for <HI>Faith,</HI> &s;ee|ing that by getting it, we have all? Men that are wi&s;e to provide for them&s;elves, and to lay out their Monies in &s;ome Purcha&s;e for the be&s;t; when they &s;ee a Ground well wooded and watered, but e&s;pecially to have &s;ome rich Mines in it, all their Minds will be upon &s;uch a Place, becau&s;e, having it, they have all with it. So it &s;hould be here, in our De&s;ires: And as there, &s;o here; get <HI>this Grace,</HI> and get all: Strengthen here, and all is &s;trong:
<PB N="141" REF="005214_0156_1016E6A33B686790">
But want here, and want every where: Ha|ving this Grace of <HI>Faith,</HI> you need not &s;eek for <HI>Wi&s;dom;</HI> for <HI>Faith</HI> will make you wi&s;e to Salvation: And you need not labour for <HI>Pa|tience;</HI> for he that is faithful, will be patient: And &s;o for other Graces. He that hath the Grace of <HI>Faith,</HI> hath them all; hath <HI>Holine&s;s,</HI> hath <HI>Cleanne&s;s,</HI> hath <HI>Love,</HI> hath a <HI>pure Mind,</HI> and <HI>good Con&s;cience;</HI> and what hath he not? The Saints of God endeavour with much Pains to get Grace, and to &s;ubdue Corruption: But becau&s;e they take not the <HI>right Way</HI> to it, they &s;eek and do not find.</P>
<P>Many a poor Soul mourns and cries to Hea|ven for Mercy, and prays again&s;t a &s;tubborn hard Heart, and is weary of his Life, becau&s;e this vile Heart remains yet in him; and yet haply gets little or no Redre&s;s: The Rea&s;on is, and the main Wound lies here; he goes the wrong Way to work; for, he that would have <HI>Grace</HI> mu&s;t (fir&s;t of all) get FAITH: <HI>Faith</HI> will bring all the re&s;t; buy the Field and the Pearl is thine; it goes with the Purcha&s;e. Thou mu&s;t not think with thine own Struggling to get the Ma&s;tery of a proud Heart; for that will not do: But let thy <HI>Faith</HI> go fir&s;t to CHRIST, and try what that can do. There are many Graces ne|ce&s;&s;ary in this Work; as <HI>Meekne&s;s, Patience, Humility,</HI> and <HI>Wi&s;dom:</HI> Now <HI>Faith</HI> will fetch all the&s;e, and po&s;&s;e&s;s the Soul of them. Bre|thren,
<PB N="142" REF="005214_0157_1016E6A62029A098">
therefore if you &s;et any Price upon the&s;e Graces, buy the Field, labour for <HI>Faith;</HI> get that, and you get all. The Apo&s;tle &s;aith, 2 Cor. 3.18. <HI>We all with open Face, beholding as in a Gla&s;s, the Glory of the</HI> LORD, <HI>are chan|ged into the &s;ame Image, from Glory to Glory.</HI> The Lord Chri&s;t is the Gla&s;s, and the glorious Grace of God in Chri&s;t, is that Glory of the Lord: Therefore fir&s;t behold this Grace in Chri&s;t by Faith (and thou mu&s;t do &s;o before thou can&s;t receive Grace.) Fir&s;t, See <HI>Hu|mility</HI> in Chri&s;t, and then fetch it thence: Fir&s;t, See Strength and Courage in him, whereby to enable thy weak Heart, and Strength will come; there fetch it, and there have it. Would you then have a <HI>meek, gracious,</HI> and <HI>humble</HI> Heart? I dare &s;ay for &s;ome of you, that you had rather have it than any Thing under Heaven, and would think it the be&s;t Bargain that ever you made; which is the Cau&s;e why you &s;ay, <Q>O that I could once &s;ee that Day, that this proud Heart of mine might be humbled: Oh if I could &s;ee the la&s;t Blood of my Sins, I &s;hould then think my &s;elf happy, none more, and de&s;ire to live no longer.</Q> But is this thy De&s;ire, poor Soul? Then get <HI>Faith,</HI> and &s;o buy the whole, for they all go together: Nor think to have them upon any Price, not having <HI>Faith:</HI> I mean <HI>Patience,</HI> and <HI>Meekne&s;s,</HI> and the <HI>hum|ble Heart:</HI> But buy <HI>Faith,</HI> the Field, and you
<PB N="143" REF="005214_0158_1016E6A7A7D02380">
have the Pearl. Further, Would you have the Glory of God in your Eye, and be more heavenly-minded? Then look to it, and get it by the Eye of <HI>Faith:</HI> Look up to it in the Face of JESUS CHRIST, and then you &s;hall &s;ee it; and then hold you there: For there, and there only, this Vi&s;ion of the Glory of God is to be &s;een, to your everla&s;ting Peace and endle&s;s Comfort. When Men u&s;e to make a Purcha&s;e, they &s;peak of all the Commo|dities of it; as, That there is &s;o much Wood, worth &s;o much; and &s;o much Stock, worth &s;o much; and then they offer for the whole, an&s;werable to the&s;e &s;everals. So here; there is <HI>Item</HI> for an <HI>heavenly Mind,</HI> and that's worth Thou&s;ands; and, <HI>Item</HI> for an <HI>humble Heart,</HI> and that's worth Millions: And &s;o for the re&s;t. And are tho&s;e Graces &s;o much worth? What is <HI>Faith</HI> worth then? Hence we may conclude and &s;ay, <HI>O precious Faith!</HI> precious indeed, that is able, thro' the Spirit of Chri&s;t, to bring &s;o many, nay, all Graces with it: As one Degree of Grace after another: Grace here, and Happine&s;s for ever hereafter. If we have but the Hearts of Men (I do not &s;ay of Chri&s;tians) methinks this that is &s;poken of <HI>Faith,</HI> &s;hould provoke us to labour always, a|bove all Things, for this ble&s;&s;ed Grace of God, the Grace of <HI>Faith.</HI></P>
