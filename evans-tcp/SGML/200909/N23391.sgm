<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen of the Jury,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING arrived at the la&s;t &s;tage of this long and intere&s;ting cau&s;e, it now becomes the duty of the court to &s;um up the evidence, and to de|clare the law ari&s;ing upon it. A ma&s;s of te&s;timony has been brought forward in the cour&s;e of the trial, the far greater part of which is altogether immaterial, and can be of no u&s;e in forming a deci&s;ion. The great points, on which the cau&s;e turns, are of a legal nature; they are que&s;tions of law; and therefore for the &s;ake of the parties, as well as for my own &s;ake, they ought to be put in a train for ultimate adjudication by the &s;upreme court. In the admini&s;tration of ju&s;|tice it is a con&s;olitary idea, that no opinion of a &s;in|gle judge can be final and deci&s;ive; but that the &s;ame may be removed before the highe&s;t tribunal for revi&s;ion, where, if erroneous, it will be rectified. For the &s;ake of clearne&s;s, I &s;hall con&s;ider,</P>

<P>The title under Connecticut is of no avail. Be|cau&s;e the land in controver&s;y is ex-territorial; it does not lie within the charter-bounds of Connecticut, but within the charter-bounds of Penn&s;ylvania. The charter of Connecticut does not over or &s;pread over the lands in que&s;tion. Of cour&s;e no title can be de|rived from Connecticut. Here then the defendant fails.</P>

<PB N="8" REF="030962_0005_0FEA0AFDA6C621D8">
<HEAD>II. <HI>Under the Indians.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The Indian deed, under which the defendant claims, bears date the 11th of July 1754. It has been ob&s;erved, that this deed is radically defective and faulty; that fraud is apparent on the face of it, and, particularly, that the &s;pecification or de&s;cription of the land is written on a razure. Of this, gentlemen, you will judge, as the deed will be given to you for in|&s;pection. Permit me to ob&s;erve, that there are &s;eve|ral ways, by which a deed may be avoided or ren|dered of no effect. One of the&s;e is by razure, addi|tion, interlining, or other alteration in any material part, if done after its execution. It is the province of the jury to determine, whether any &s;uch alteration was made after the delivery of the deed.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, this deed appears to have been executed at different times; and not in that open, public, national manner, in which the Indians &s;ell and trans|fer their lands.</P>
<P>But if the deed was fairly obtained; if it has le|gal exi&s;tence, then, what is its legal operation.</P>
<P>By the charter to William Penn, the right of pre|emption attached, and was ve&s;ted in him to all the lands comprehended within its limits. The Penn family had exclu&s;ively the right of purcha&s;ing the lands of the Indians; and, indeed, the Indians entered in|to a &s;tipulation of that kind.</P>
<P>Again, this deed is invalid by the laws of Penn|&s;ylvania. The legi&s;lature of Penn&s;ylvania,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Penn&s;yl. Laws 3.</NOTE> by an act pa&s;&s;ed the 7th Feb. 1705, declare, <Q>That if any per|&s;on pre&s;ume to buy any land of the natives, within
<PB N="9" REF="030962_0006_0FEA0AFF7A4CE570">
the limits of this province and territories, without leave from the proprietary thereof, every &s;uch bargain or purcha&s;e &s;hall be void and of no effect.</Q></P>
<P>By an act pa&s;&s;ed the 14th Feb. 1729&mdash;30, it is further declared, <Q>That every gift, grant, bargain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Penn&s;yl. Laws, 157, 158.</NOTE> &s;ale, written or verbal contract or agreement, and every pretended conveyance, lea&s;e, demi&s;e, and every other a&s;&s;urance made, or that &s;hall hereafter be made, with any of the Indian natives, for any lands, &amp;c. within the limits of this province, without the order or direction of the proprietary or his com|mi&s;&s;ioners, &s;hall be null, void, and of no effect.</Q></P>
<P>The land in controver&s;y being within the limits of Penn&s;ylvania, the Connecticut &s;ettlers were in le|gal e&s;timation, tre&s;pa&s;&s;ers and intruders. They pur|cha&s;ed the land without leave, and entered upon it without right.</P>
<P>They purcha&s;ed and entered upon the land with|out the con&s;ent of the legi&s;lature of Connecticut. True it is, that the legi&s;lature of Connecticut gave a &s;ub&s;equent approbation, but this was po&s;terior to the deed executed by the Six Nations to Penn at fort Stanwix, and the principle of relation does not retro|&s;pect &s;o as to affect third per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The con&s;equence is, that the Connecticut &s;ettlers derive no title under the Indian deed.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="jurisdiction">
<P N="3">III. The title which the defendant &s;ets up <HI>under Penn&s;ylvania.</HI> This is the key&s;tone of the defendant's title, as one of his coun&s;el very properly expre&s;&s;ed it. It required no great &s;agacity to perceive, that the de|fendant's hope of &s;ucce&s;s was founded on a law of
<PB N="10" REF="030962_0007_0FEA0B02131BFBA8">
Penn&s;ylvania, commonly called the quieting and con|firming act. This act, and the two &s;ub&s;equent ones of a &s;u&s;pending and a repealing nature, open an exten&s;ive and important field for di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. In general ver|dicts, it frequently becomes nece&s;&s;ary for juries to de|cide upon the law as well as the facts. To form a correct judgment, legal principles mu&s;t be taken up and applied, and when this is done in a proper man|ner, it gives &s;tability to judicial deci&s;ions, and &s;ecurity to civil rights. Hence uniformity and certainty; hence the deci&s;ions of to-morrow will be like the de|ci&s;ions of to-day; they will run in the &s;ame line, be|cau&s;e they are founded on the &s;ame principles. To aid you, Gentlemen, in forming a verdict, I &s;hall con&s;ider,</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="basis for verdict">
<P N="1">I. The con&s;titutionality of the confirming act, or, in other words, whether the legi&s;lature had authority to make that act.</P>
<P>Legi&s;lation is the exerci&s;e of &s;overeign authority. High and important powers are nece&s;&s;arily ve&s;ted in the legi&s;lative body, who&s;e acts, under &s;ome forms of government, are irre&s;i&s;tible and &s;ubject to no control. In England, from whence mo&s;t of our legal principles and legi&s;lative notions are derived, the authority of the parliament is tran&s;cendent and has no bounds.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Bl. Com. 160.</NOTE><Q>The power and juri&s;diction of parliament, &s;ays Sir Edward Coke, is &s;o tran&s;cendent and ab&s;olute, that it cannot be confined, either for cau&s;es or per&s;ons, within any bounds. And of this high court, he adds, it may be truly &s;aid, <HI>Si antiquitatem &s;pectes, e&s;t vetu&s;|ti&s;&s;ima; &s;i dignitatem, e&s;t honorati&s;&s;ima; &s;i juri&s;dic|tionem,
<PB N="11" REF="030962_0008_0FEA0B052C1942C8">
e&s;t capaci&s;&s;ima.</HI> It has &s;overeign and un|controlable authority in the making, confirming, enlarging, re&s;training, abrogating, repealing, re|viving, and expounding of laws, concerning matters of all po&s;&s;ible denominations, eccle&s;ia&s;tical or tem|poral, civil, military, maritime, or criminal: this being the place where that ab&s;olute de&s;potic power, which mu&s;t in all governments re&s;ide &s;omewhere, is entru&s;ted by the con&s;titution of the&s;e kingdoms. All mi&s;chiefs and grievances, operations and remedies, that tran&s;cend the ordinary cour&s;e of the laws, are within the reach of this extraordinary tribunal. It can regulate or new model the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown; as was done in the reign of Henry VIII. and William III. It can alter the e&s;tabli&s;hed re|ligion of the land; as was done in a variety of in|&s;tances, in the reigns of king Henry VIII. and his three children. It can change and create afre&s;h even the con&s;titution of the kingdom and of parliaments them&s;elves; as was done by the act of union, and the &s;everal &s;tatutes for triennial and &s;eptennial elections. It can, in &s;hort, do every thing that is not naturally impo&s;&s;ible; and there|fore &s;ome have not &s;crupled to call its power, by a figure rather too bold, the omnipotence of parlia|ment. True it is, that what the parliament doth, no authority upon earth can undo.</Q></P>
<P>From this pa&s;&s;age it is evident, that, in England, the authority of the parliament runs without limits, and ri&s;es above control. It is difficult to &s;ay what the con&s;titution of England is, becau&s;e not being reduced to written certainty and preci&s;ion, it lies entirely at
<PB N="12" REF="030962_0009_0FEA0B07B5A9DE88">
the mercy of the parliament. It bends to every go|vermental exigency; it varies and is blown about by every breeze of legi&s;lative humour or political caprice.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hob. 87. 12 Mod. 687.</NOTE>Some of the judges in England have had the boldne&s;s to a&s;&s;ert, that an act of parliament made again&s;t natu|ral equity is void; but this opinion contravenes the general po&s;ition, that the validity of an act of parlia|ment cannot be drawn into que&s;tion by the judicial department. It cannot be di&s;puted, and mu&s;t be obeyed. The power of parliament is ab&s;olute and tran&s;cendent; it is omnipotent in the &s;cale of politi|cal exi&s;tence. Be&s;ides, in England there is no writ|ten con&s;titution, no fundamental law, nothing vi&s;ible, nothing real, nothing certain, by which a &s;tatute can be te&s;ted. In America the ca&s;e is widely different. Every &s;tate in the union has its con&s;titution reduced to written exactitude and preci&s;ion.</P>
<P>What is a con&s;titution? It is the form of govern|ment, delineated by the mighty hand of the people, in which certain fir&s;t principles or fundamental laws are e&s;tabli&s;hed. The con&s;titution is certain and fixed; it contains the permanent will of the people, and is the &s;upreme law of the land; it is paramount to the power of the legi&s;lature, and can be revoked or al|tered only by the authority that made it. The life-giv|ing principle and the death-doing &s;troke mu&s;t proceed from the &s;ame hand. What are legi&s;latures? Creatures of the con&s;titution&mdash;they owe their exi&s;tence to the con&s;titution&mdash;they derive their powers from the con|&s;titution&mdash;it is their commi&s;&s;ion; and therefore all their acts mu&s;t be conformable to it, or el&s;e they will be void&mdash;The con&s;titution is the work or will of the
<PB N="13" REF="030962_0010_0FEA0B09DAC7FCD0">
people them&s;elves, in their original, &s;overeign, and unlimited capacity. Law is the work or will of the legi&s;lature in their derivative and &s;ubordinate capaci|ty. The one is the work of the creator, and the other of the creature. The con&s;titution fixes limits to the exerci&s;e of legi&s;lative authority, and pre&s;cribes the orbit, within which it mu&s;t move. In &s;hort, gentle|men, the con&s;titution is the &s;un of the political &s;y&s;|tem, around which all legi&s;lative, executive, and judi|cial bodies mu&s;t revolve. Whatever may be the ca&s;e in other countries, yet in this there can be no doubt, that every act of the legi&s;lature repugnant to the con&s;ti|tution is ab&s;olutely void.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd article of the declaration of rights, which was made part of the late con&s;titution of Penn|&s;ylvania, it is declared, <Q>That all men have a natural and unalienable right to wor&s;hip Almighty God ac|cording to the dictates of their own con&s;ciences and under&s;tanding:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Declaration of rights, Article 2.</NOTE>and that no man ought, or of right can be compelled to attend any religious wor|&s;hip, or erect or &s;upport any place of wor&s;hip, or, maintain any mini&s;try, contrary to, or again&s;t, his own free will and con&s;ent: nor can any man, who acknowledges the being of a God, be ju&s;tly deprived or abridged of any civil right as a citizen, on account of his religious &s;entiments, or peculiar mode of reli|gious wor&s;hip; and that no authority can or ought to be ve&s;ted in, or a&s;&s;umed by any power whatever, that &s;hall in any ca&s;e interfere with, or in any man|ner control, the right of con&s;cience in the free exer|ci&s;e of religious wor&s;hip.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="030962_0011_0FEA0B0B7422B9B8">
In the thirty &s;econd &s;ection of the &s;ame con&s;titution it is ordained, <Q>That all elections,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;titution of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ect. 32.</NOTE>whether by the people or in general a&s;&s;embly &s;hall be by ballot, free and voluntary.</Q></P>
<P>Could the legi&s;lature have annulled the&s;e articles re&s;pecting religion, the rights of con&s;cience, and elec|tions by ballot? Surely no. As to the&s;e points there was no devolution of power&mdash;the authority was pur|po&s;ely withheld, and re&s;erved by the people to them|&s;elves. If the legi&s;lature had pa&s;&s;ed an act declaring, that, in future, there &s;hould be no trial by jury, would it have been obligatory? No&mdash;it would have been void for want of juri&s;diction, or con&s;titutional extent of power. The right of trial by jury is a fundamental law, made &s;acred by the con&s;titution, and cannot be legi&s;lated away. The con&s;titution of a &s;tate is &s;table and permanent, not to be worked upon by the tem|per of the times, nor to ri&s;e and fall with the tide of events: notwith&s;tanding the competition of oppo&s;ing intere&s;ts, and the violence of contending parties, it remains firm and immoveable, as a mountain amid&s;t the &s;trife of &s;torms, or a rock in the ocean amid&s;t the raging of the waves. I take it to be a clear po&s;i|tion, that if a legi&s;lative act oppugns a con&s;titutional principle, the former mu&s;t give way, and be rejected on the &s;core of repugnance. I hold it to be a po&s;ition equally clear and &s;ound, that, in &s;uch ca&s;e, it will be the duty of the court to adhere to the con&s;titution, and to declare the act null and void. The con&s;titution is the ba&s;is of legi&s;lative authority; it lies at the foun|dation of all law, and is a rule and commi&s;&s;ion by which both legi&s;lators and judges are to proceed. It
<PB N="15" REF="030962_0012_0FEA0B0E0D889D68">
is an important principle, which, in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of que&s;tions of the pre&s;ent kind, ought never to be lo&s;t &s;ight of, that the judiciary in this country is not a &s;ub|ordinate, but co-ordinate, branch of the govern|ment.</P>
<P>Having made the&s;e preliminary ob&s;ervations, we &s;hall proceed to contemplate the quieting and confirm|ing act, and to bring its validity to the te&s;t of the con|&s;titution.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of argument, the coun&s;el on both &s;ides relied upon certain parts of the late bill of rights and con&s;titution of Penn&s;ylvania, which I &s;hall now read, and then refer to them occa&s;ionally in the &s;equel of the charge.</P>
<Q><P>That all men are born equally free and indepen|dent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Declaration of rights, article 1.</NOTE>and have certain natural, inherent, and un|alienable rights, among&s;t which are the enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing and protecting property, and pur&s;uing and obtaining happine&s;s and &s;afety.</P>

<P>From the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages it is evident, that the right of acquiring and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing property, and having it pro|tected, is one of the natural, inherent, and unaliena|ble rights of man. Men have a &s;en&s;e of property. Property is nece&s;&s;ary to their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and corre&s;|pondent

to their natural wants and de&s;ires; its &s;ecurity was one of the objects, that induced them to unite in &s;ociety. No man would become a member of a com|munity, in which he could not enjoy the fruits of his hone&s;t labour and indu&s;try. The pre&s;ervation of pro|perty then is a primary object of the &s;ocial compact, and by the late con&s;titution of Penn&s;ylvania, was made a fundamental law. Every per&s;on ought to contribute his proportion for public purpo&s;es and public exigen|cies; but, no one can be called upon to &s;urrender or &s;acrifice his whole property, real and per&s;onal, for the good of the community, without receiving a recom|pence in value. This would be laying a burden upon an individual, which ought to be &s;u&s;tained by the &s;o|ciety at large. The Engli&s;h hi&s;tory does not furni&s;h an in&s;tance of the kind; the parliament, with all their boa&s;ted omnipotence, never committed &s;uch an out|rage on private property; and if they had, it would have &s;erved only to di&s;play the dangerous nature of un|limited authority; it would have been an exerci&s;e of power and not of right. Such an act would be a mon|&s;ter in legi&s;lation, and &s;hock all mankind. The legi&s;la|ture, therefore, had no authority to make an act dive&s;t|ing one citizen of his freehold, and ve&s;ting it in ano|ther, without a ju&s;t compen&s;ation. It is incon&s;i&s;tent with the principles of rea&s;on, ju&s;tice and moral rec|titude; it is incompatible with the comfort, peace, and happine&s;s of mankind; it is contrary to the principles of &s;ocial alliance in every free government, and la&s;tly it is contrary both to the letter and &s;pirit of the con&s;ti|tution. In &s;hort, it is what every one would think un|rea&s;onable and unju&s;t in his own ca&s;e. The next &s;tep
<PB N="18" REF="030962_0015_0FEA0B15B3595708">
in the line of progre&s;&s;ion is, whether the legi&s;lature had authority to make an act dive&s;ting one citizen of his freehold and ve&s;ting it in another, even with compen&s;ation. That the legi&s;lature, on certain emer|gencies, had authority to exerci&s;e this high power has been urged from the nature of the &s;ocial compact, and from the words of the con&s;titution, which &s;ays, that the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives &s;hall have all other powers nece&s;&s;ary for the legi&s;lature of a free &s;tate or commonwealth; but they &s;hall have no power to add to, alter, aboli&s;h, or infringe any part of this con&s;titution. The cour&s;e of rea&s;oning on the part of the defendant may be compri&s;ed in a few words. The de&s;potic power, as it is aptly called by &s;ome writers, of ta|king private property, when &s;tate nece&s;&s;ity requires, exi&s;ts in every government; the exi&s;tence of &s;uch power is nece&s;&s;ary; government could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t without it; and if this be the ca&s;e, it cannot be lodg|ed any where with &s;o much &s;afety as with the legi&s;la|ture. The pre&s;umption is, that they will not call it into exerci&s;e except in urgent ca&s;es, or ca&s;es of the fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ity. There is force in this rea&s;oning. It is, however, difficult to form a ca&s;e, in which the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of a &s;tate can be of &s;uch a nature as to au|thori&s;e or excu&s;e the &s;eizing of landed property, be|longing to one citizen and giving it to another citizen. It is immaterial to the &s;tate, in which of its citizens the land is ve&s;ted; but it is of primary importance, that, when ve&s;ted, it &s;hould be &s;ecured, and the pro|prietor protected in the enjoyment of it. The con|&s;titution encircles, and renders it an holy thing. We mu&s;t, gentlemen, bear con&s;tantly in mind, that the
<PB N="19" REF="030962_0016_0FEA0B1884F94508">
pre&s;ent is a ca&s;e of landed property, ve&s;ted by law in one &s;et of citizens, attempted to be dive&s;ted, for the purpo&s;e of ve&s;ting the &s;ame property in another &s;et of citizens. It cannot be a&s;&s;imilated to the ca&s;e of per&s;on|al property taken or u&s;ed in time of war or famine, or other extreme nece&s;&s;ity; it cannot be a&s;&s;imilated to the temporary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of land it&s;elf on a pre&s;&s;ing public emergency, or the &s;pur of the occa&s;ion. In the latter ca&s;e there is no change of property, no dive&s;tment of right, the title remains, and the proprietor, though out of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for a while, is &s;till proprietor and lord of the &s;oil. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion grew out of the occa&s;ion and cea&s;es with it. Then the right of nece&s;&s;ity is &s;a|tisfied and at an end; it does not affect the title, is tem|porary in its nature, and cannot exi&s;t forever. The con&s;titution expre&s;sly declares, that the right of acquir|ing, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, and protecting property is natural, in|herent, and unalienable. It is a right not <HI>ex gratia</HI> from the legi&s;lature, but <HI>ex debito</HI> from the con&s;tituti|on. It is &s;acred; for it is further declared, that the legi&s;lature &s;hall have no power to add to, alter, aboli&s;h, or infringe any part of the con&s;titution. The con&s;ti|tution is the origin and mea&s;ure of legi&s;lative authority. It &s;ays to legi&s;lators, Thus far ye &s;hall go and no fur|ther. Not a particle of it &s;hould be &s;haken; not a pebble of it &s;hould be removed. Innovation is dan|gerous. One incroachment leads to another; prece|dent gives birth to precedent; what has been done may be done again; thus radical principles are gradually broken in upon, and the con&s;titution eventually de|&s;troyed. Where the &s;ecurity, where the inviolability of property, if the legi&s;lature, by a private act, affect|ing
<PB N="20" REF="030962_0017_0FEA0B1BA4094FB0">
particular per&s;ons only, can take land from one citizen, who acquired it legally, and ve&s;t it in ano|ther? The rights of private property are regulated, protected, and governed by general, known, and e&s;ta|bli&s;hed laws; and decided upon by general, known, and e&s;tabli&s;hed tribunals; laws and tribunals not made and created on an in&s;tant exigency, on an urgent emergency, to &s;erve a pre&s;ent turn, or the intere&s;t of a moment. Their operation and influence are equal and univer&s;al; they pre&s;s alike on all. Hence &s;ecurity and &s;afety, tranquillity and peace. One man is not afraid of another, and no man afraid of the legi&s;lature. It is infinitely wi&s;er and &s;afer to ri&s;k &s;ome po&s;&s;ible mi&s;chiefs than to ve&s;t in the legi&s;lature &s;o unnece&s;&s;ary, dangerous, and enormous a power as that which has been exerci&s;ed on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion; a power, that, according to the full extent of the argu|ment, is boundle&s;s and omnipotent. For the legi&s;|lature judged of the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e, and al&s;o of the nature and value of the equivalent.</P>
<P>Such a ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, and judging too of the compen&s;ation, can never occur in any nation. Sin|gular, indeed, and untoward mu&s;t be the &s;tate of things, that would induce the legi&s;lature, &s;uppo&s;ing they had the power, to dive&s;t one individual of his landed e&s;tate merely for the purpo&s;e of ve&s;ting it in another, even upon full indemnification; unle&s;s that indemnification be a&s;certained in the manner which I &s;hall mention hereafter.</P>
<P>But admitting, that the legi&s;lature can take the real e&s;tate of A. and give it to B. on making compen|&s;ation, the principle and rea&s;oning upon it go no further

than to &s;hew, that the legi&s;lature are the &s;ole and ex|clu&s;ive judges of the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e, in which this de&s;potic power &s;hould be called into action. It cannot, on the principles of the &s;ocial alliance, or of the con&s;titution, be extended beyond the point of judging upon every exi&s;ting ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity. The legi&s;|lature declare and enact, that &s;uch are the public exi|gencies, or nece&s;&s;ities of the &s;tate, as to authori&s;e them to take the land of A. and give it to B.; the dictates of rea|&s;on and the eternal principles of ju&s;tice, as well as the &s;acred principles of the &s;ocial contract, and the con&s;ti|tution, direct, and they accordingly declare and ordain, that A. &s;hall receive compen&s;ation for the land. But here the legi&s;lature ma&s;t &s;top; they have run the full length of their authority, and can go no further: they cannot con&s;titutionally determine upon the a|mount of the compen&s;ation, or value of the land. Public exigencies do not require, nece&s;&s;ity does not demand, that the legi&s;lature &s;hould, of them&s;elves, without the participation of the proprietor, or inter|vention of a jury, a&s;&s;e&s;s the value of the thing, or a&s;|certain the amount of the compen&s;ation to be paid for it.

<P><PB N="25" REF="030962_0022_0FEA0B265FB42660">
The ca&s;e of the I&s;le of Man was a fair and honour|able &s;tipulation; it partook of the &s;pirit and e&s;&s;ence of a contract: it was free and mutual; and was treat|ing with the proprietors on equal terms. But if the bu&s;ine&s;s cannot be effected in this way, then the value of the land, intended to be taken, &s;hould be a&s;cer|tained by commi&s;&s;ioners, or per&s;ons mutually elected by the parties, or by the intervention of the judiciary, of which a jury is a component part. In the fir&s;t ca&s;e, we approximate nearly to a contract; becau&s;e the will of the party, who&s;e property is to be affected, is in &s;ome degree exerci&s;ed; he has a choice; his own act co-operates with that of the legi&s;lature. In the other ca&s;e, there is the intervention of a court of law, or, in other words, a jury is to pa&s;s between the pub|lic and the individual, who, after hearing the proofs and allegations of the parties, will, by their verdict, fix the value of the property, or the &s;um to be paid for it. The compen&s;ation, if not agreed upon by the parties or their agents, mu&s;t be a&s;certained by a jury. The interpo&s;ition of a jury is, in &s;uch ca&s;e, a con&s;titutional guard upon property, and a nece&s;&s;ary check to legi&s;lative authority. It is a barrier between the individual and the legi&s;lature, and ought never to be removed; as long as it is pre&s;erved, the rights of private property will be in no danger of violation, ex|cept in ca&s;es of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, or great public uti|lity. By the confirming act, the value of the land taken and the value of the land to be paid in recom|pence, are to be a&s;certained by the board of property. And who are the per&s;ons that con&s;titute this board? Men appointed by one of the parties, by the legi&s;la|ture
<PB N="26" REF="030962_0023_0FEA0B2858E615A0">
only. The per&s;on, who&s;e property is to be di|ve&s;ted and valued, had no volition, no choice, no co-operation in the appointment; and be&s;ides, the other con&s;titutional guard upon property, that of a jury, is removed and done away. The board of pro|perty, thus con&s;tituted, are authori&s;ed to decide upon the value of the land to be taken, and upon the value of the land to be given by way of equivalent, with|out the participation of the party or the intervention of a jury.</P>
<P N="2">2. The nature of the compen&s;ation.</P>
<P>By the act the equivalent is to be in land. No ju&s;t compen&s;ation can be made except in money. Money is a common &s;tandard, by compari&s;on with which the value of any thing may be a&s;certained. It is not only a &s;ign which repre&s;ents the re&s;pective values of com|modities, but is an univer&s;al medium, ea&s;ily portable, liable to little variation, and readily exchanged for any kind of property. Compen&s;ation is a recompence in value, <HI>a quid pro quo,</HI> and mu&s;t be in money. True it is, that land or any thing el&s;e may be a compen&s;a|tion, but then it mu&s;t be at the election of the party; it cannot be forced upon him. His con&s;ent will lega|li&s;e the act, and make it valid; nothing &s;hort of it will have the effect. It is obvious, that if a jury pa&s;s upon the &s;ubject or value of the property, their verdict mu&s;t be in money.</P>
<P>To clo&s;e this part of the di&s;cour&s;e: It is con|tended that the legi&s;lature mu&s;t judge of the nece&s;&s;ity of interpo&s;ing their de&s;potic authority; it is a right of nece&s;&s;ity upon which no other power in govern|ment can decide: that no civil in&s;titution is perfect;
<PB N="27" REF="030962_0024_0FEA0B2AB6B347D8">
and that ca&s;es will occur, in which private property mu&s;t yield to urgent calls of public utility or general danger. Be it &s;o. But then it mu&s;t be upon complete indemnification to the individual. Agreed. But who &s;hall judge of this indemnification? Did there al&s;o exi&s;t a &s;tate nece&s;&s;ity, that the legi&s;lature, or per&s;ons &s;olely appointed by them, mu&s;t admea&s;ure the compen|&s;ation, or value of the lands &s;eized and taken, and the validity of the title thereto? Did a third &s;tate nece&s;&s;ity exi&s;t, that the proprietor mu&s;t take land by way of equivalent for his land? And did a fourth &s;tate nece&s;|&s;ity exi&s;t, that the value of this land equivalent mu&s;t be adju&s;ted by the board of property, without the con|&s;ent of the party, or the interference of a jury? Alas! how nece&s;&s;ity begets nece&s;&s;ity. They ri&s;e upon each other and become endle&s;s. The proprietor &s;tands afar off, a &s;olitary and unprotected member of the community, and is &s;tript of his property, without his con&s;ent, without a hearing, without notice, the value of that property judged upon without his participa|tion, or the intervention of a jury, and the equiva|lent therefor in lands a&s;certained in the &s;ame way. If this be the legi&s;lation of a republican government, in which the pre&s;ervation of property is made &s;acred by the con&s;titution, I a&s;k, wherein it differs from the mandate of an A&s;iatic prince. Omnipotence in le|gi&s;lation is de&s;poti&s;m. According to this doctrine, we have nothing that we can call our own, or are &s;ure of for a moment; we are all tenants at will, and hold our landed property at the mere plea&s;ure of the legi&s;|lature. Wretched &s;ituation, precarious tenure! And yet we boa&s;t of property and its &s;ecurity, of laws, of

<P>It is contended, on the part of the defendant, that on the pa&s;&s;ing of the act the e&s;tate was dive&s;ted from the Penn&s;ylvania claimants, and in&s;tantly ve&s;ted in the Connecticut &s;ettlers.

<P>Every &s;tatute, derogatory to the rights of pro|perty, or that takes away the e&s;tate of a citizen, ought to be con&s;trued &s;trictly.</P>

<P>The e&s;tate of the Penn&s;ylvania claimants was not dive&s;ted on the pa&s;&s;ing of the act; it was not dive&s;ted on pre&s;enting the claim on the part of the Connecticut &s;ettlers. Other acts were previou&s;ly nece&s;&s;ary, and in particular the commi&s;&s;ioners mu&s;t pa&s;s upon and con|firm the claim before the e&s;tate is dive&s;ted from the one party and ve&s;ted in the other. The&s;e things pre|cede, and mu&s;t be done before any e&s;tate can ve&s;t in the defendant; but they have not been, and therefore the e&s;tate remains in the plaintiff. This con&s;truction corre&s;ponds with the meaning and &s;pirit, the tenden|cy and &s;cope of the act it&s;elf. The intention of the legi&s;lature was to ve&s;t in Connecticut claimants of a particular de&s;cription a perfect e&s;tate to certain lands in the county of Luzerne; but then it was upon con|dition; it was to operate upon, &s;ecure, and &s;anctify &s;uch claims only as &s;hould be admitted and a&s;certained, approved and e&s;tabli&s;hed by the commi&s;&s;ioners. This is further evident from the powers and functions of the commi&s;&s;ioners, who were to enquire, examine, hear
<PB N="35" REF="030962_0032_0FEA0B403151A7F8">
proofs, &amp;c. re&s;pecting the claims; and for what pur|po&s;e? why, that they might admit and approve of &s;uch as were &s;upported by &s;atisfactory evidence, and make return thereof to the executive council, who &s;hould thereupon cau&s;e patents to be i&s;&s;ued for their confirmation. Until the commi&s;&s;ioners had decided in favor of a claim, it remained <HI>in &s;tatu quo;</HI> the act did not cover and protect it. Further, if the act will ad|mit of two con&s;tructions, that one certainly ought to be adopted, which is in favor of the legal owner, and which will not dive&s;t his e&s;tate, till the terms &s;pecified in the act &s;hall have been fully complied with. When the legi&s;lature undertake to give away what is not their own, when they attempt to take the property of one man, which he fairly acquired, and the general law of the land protects, in order to transfer it to another, even upon complete indemnification, it will naturally be con&s;idered as an extraordinary act of legi&s;lation, which ought to be viewed with jealous eyes, examined with critical exactne&s;s, and &s;crutinized with all the &s;e|verity of legal expo&s;ition. An act of this &s;ort de&s;erves no favor; to con&s;true it liberally would be &s;inning again&s;t the rights of property.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, it was the manife&s;t intention of the makers of the act, that a ju&s;t compen&s;ation &s;hould be made in land to the Penn&s;ylvania claimants; upon this prin|ciple the act proceeds; and therefore if it appear, that &s;uch compen&s;ation cannot be made, or that it is very dubious, whether it can be effected; the court ought not to give &s;uch a con&s;truction, as will deprive the owner of his e&s;tate, with little or no pro&s;pect of being recompen&s;ed in value. If either party ought to be

driven to the nece&s;&s;ity of controverting the que&s;tion with the &s;tate of Penn&s;ylvania, it ought to be the Con|necticut &s;ettlers, who have no legal title to the land, and not the Penn&s;ylvania claimants, in whom is ve&s;ted a good e&s;tate at law.</P>
<P>Deeming the con&s;truction, which has been put upon the act, to be the &s;ound one, it precludes the enquiry, how far a patent of confirmation was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ub&s;tantiate the claim of the defendant, &s;o as to render it available in a court of common law.</P>

<P N="3">III. The nature and operation of the &s;u&s;pending act.</P>
<P>This act was pa&s;&s;ed the 29th of March, 1788, and is as follows.</P>
<Q><P N="1">Sect. 1. Whereas by an act, entitled, <Q>An act for a&s;certaining and confirming to certain per&s;ons, called Connecticut claimants, the lands by them claimed within the county of Luzerne, and for other purpo&s;es therein mentioned,</Q> it is among other things "enacted, that certain commi&s;&s;ioners therein named, or thereafter to be appointed, &s;hould, with|in, a limited time, meet together within the &s;aid county, for the purpo&s;e of receiving and examining the claims of the &s;aid claimants, and a&s;certaining and confirming the &s;ame. And whereas when the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners had met in pur&s;uance of the &s;aid law, they were interrupted in their proceedings by the combinations, threatenings, and outrageous violence of certain lawle&s;s people in the &s;aid county of Lu|zerne, and obliged to fly for the pre&s;ervation of their

And whereas doubts have al&s;o ari&s;en concern|ing the con&s;truction, true intent, and meaning of &s;aid law, for which and other cau&s;es it hath become very difficult to determine the &s;ame, and to adju&s;t the compen&s;ation to be made to tho&s;e per&s;ons, who will be dive&s;ted of their property by the operation of the &s;aid law, if the &s;ame &s;hould be carried into effect. And whereas the time, in which the&s;e com|mi&s;&s;ioners were to receive claims, has expired, but their other powers &s;till remain, which, if immediate|ly executed, without further provi&s;ions and regula|tions being previou&s;ly made, will tend to embarra&s;&s;|ment and confu&s;ion.</P>
<P N="2">Sect. 2. <HI>Be it therefore enacted,</HI> and it is hereby enacted by the repre&s;entatives of the freemen of the commonwealth of Penn&s;ylvania in General A&s;&s;em|bly met, and by the authority of the &s;ame, that &s;o much of the &s;aid law as empowers the &s;aid commi&s;|&s;ioners to a&s;certain and confirm the claims of the &s;aid people called Connecticut claimants, and all and every part of &s;aid act, which gives any power and authority to the &s;aid commi&s;&s;ioners, be and the &s;ame is hereby &s;u&s;pended, until the legi&s;lature of this com|monwealth &s;hall, by a law for that purpo&s;e to be enacted, make further provi&s;ions and regulations in the premi&s;es, and &s;hall direct and require the &s;aid commi&s;&s;ioners to proceed in the exerci&s;e of their &s;aid powers.</P></Q>
<P>This act was pa&s;&s;ed before the adoption of the con|&s;titution of the United States, and therefore is not af|fected by it. If the legi&s;lature had authority to make the confirming act, they had al&s;o authority to &s;u&s;pend

it. Their con&s;titutional power reached to both, or to neither. By the act of the 28th of March 1787, the commi&s;&s;ioners were to a&s;certain and confirm the claims of the Connecticut &s;ettlers, upon the doing whereof the e&s;tate, if the law was con&s;titutional, would become ve&s;ted in them. This has not been done; the claim in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance has not been a&s;|certained and confirmed; and as this act &s;u&s;pends or revokes the&s;e a&s;certaining and confirming powers, it never can be done. Of cour&s;e there is an end of the bu&s;ine&s;s. The parties are placed on their original ground; they are re&s;tored to their pri&s;tine &s;ituation.</P>

Over public pro|perty they have a di&s;po&s;ing and controlling power, over private property they have none, except, per|haps, in certain ca&s;es, and tho&s;e under re&s;trictions, and except al&s;o what may ari&s;e from the enactment and o|peration of general laws re&s;pecting property, which will affect them&s;elves as well as their con&s;tituents.

it the confirming act be a contract between the legi&s;|lature of Penn&s;ylvania and the Connecticut &s;ettlers, it mu&s;t be regulated by the rules and principles, which pervade and govern all ca&s;es of contracts; and if &s;o, it is clearly void, becau&s;e it tends, in its operation and con&s;equences, to defraud the Penn&s;ylvania claimants, who are third per&s;ons, of their ju&s;t rights; rights a&s;|certained, protected, and &s;ecured by the con&s;titution and known laws of the land. The plaintiffs title to the land in que&s;tion is legally derived from Penn&s;yl|vania; how then, on the principles of contract, could Penn&s;ylvania lawfully di&s;po&s;e of it to another? As a contract, it could convey no right, without the owner's con&s;ent; without that, it was fraudulent and void.</P>
<P>I &s;hall clo&s;e the di&s;cour&s;e with a brief recapitula|tion of its leading points.</P>
<P N="1">1. The confirming act is uncon&s;titutional and void. It was invalid from the beginning, had no life or ope|ration, and is preci&s;ely in the &s;ame &s;tate, as if it had not been made. If &s;o, the plaintiffs title remains in full force.</P>
<P N="2">2. If the confirming act is con&s;titutional, the con|ditions of it have not been performed; and therefore the e&s;tate continues in the plaintiff.</P>
<P N="3">3. The confirming act has been &s;u&s;pended&mdash;and</P>
<P N="4">4. Repealed.</P>
