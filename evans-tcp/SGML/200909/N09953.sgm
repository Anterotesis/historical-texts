<HEAD>A REPLY TO Mr. <HI>Jo&s;eph Fi&s;h.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ALL mu&s;t allow that to know, the true limits of the church of Chri&s;t, what are his in&s;titutions, and who have a right to them, are matters of no &s;mall impor|tance; tho' many have complained, and not without rea&s;on, that in many of the controver|&s;ies about them in our day, the nature of the &s;ubject has not been &s;o clo&s;ely attended to as it ought, but that many things have been intro|duced which tend to mi&s;lead or perplex the en|quiring mind, rather than to enlighten it. And as I &s;hall have occa&s;ion before I clo&s;e this di&s;|cour&s;e to give the particular rea&s;ons of my writ|ing upon this &s;ubject, I de&s;ire to refer the reader thereto for his own &s;atisfaction, and would pro|ceed directly to the argument in hand.</P>
<P>In 1767 Mr. <HI>Jo&s;eph Fi&s;h</HI> publi&s;hed nine &s;er|mons from Mat. 16.18. in which he tried to prove, that tho&s;e called <HI>&s;tanding churches</HI> in New-England, are built upon the Rock, and from
<PB N="4" REF="012655_0003_0F8BBEDC87878938">thence to &s;hew what great evils they are guilty of who have withdrawn from them. In this proceeding many were &s;o fully per&s;uaded that he had injured both the truth and people of God, that I was prevailed with to publi&s;h an axamina|tion of tho&s;e &s;ermons in 1768.</P>
<P>Again&s;t which Mr. <HI>F.</HI> has endeavoured to vin|dicate him&s;elf and his &s;ermons, in a piece intitled, <HI>The Examiner Examined,</HI> printed 1771; which, for rea&s;ons hereafter to be given, I think expedient to make &s;ome reply to, under the following heads.</P>
<P N="1">I. Of the <HI>matter</HI> of the go&s;pel church.</P>
<P>This is the capital point of our di&s;pute. I concurred with Mr. <HI>F.</HI> that the <Q>Truth which Peter confe&s;&s;ed, or the per&s;on of Chri&s;t, of whom this confe&s;&s;ion is made, is the ROCK upon which Je&s;us Chri&s;t re&s;olves to build his church; and that Peter was one of tho&s;e <HI>lively &s;tones,</HI> or precious <HI>materials</HI> of that building.</Q> And when he ob&s;erved from Deut. 29.10, &amp;c. <Q>That children, even infants were always reckoned a part of that body or church, which the Lord gathered in Abraham's family,</Q> I readily concurred with that al&s;o; but when he &s;aid, <Q>Is it not altogether rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that the Chri&s;tian church is made up of the <HI>&s;ame materials,</HI> that the Jewi&s;h church was?</Q> my an&s;wer was, No by no means, becau&s;e God has &s;aid the contrary; to prove which I referred him to &s;er. 31.31, 32. Heb. 8.5, &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Let the reader ob&s;erve, that through this di&s;cour&s;e, Ser. &s;tands for Mr. <HI>F</HI>'s Sermons: Ex. for my Examination of them; and only p. with figures, for his la&s;t piece.</NOTE> Ex. p. 11, 12.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="012655_0004_0F8BBEDD44E03310">
Now in reply Mr. <HI>F.</HI> charges me a number of times with entirely mi&s;taking his meaning, for no better rea&s;on that I can &s;ee, than only becau&s;e I dont agree with it. At length he comes to the point in hand, and &s;ays if he under&s;tands me, he thinks my meaning is, <Q>That the covenant which God made with I&s;rael when he brought them up out of Egypt, was the covenant which took in parents and children, and made them the <HI>materials</HI> of the Jewi&s;h church; but the new covenant which he would make with them afterwards is e&s;&s;entially different from that covenant; and therefore there mu&s;t be an e&s;&s;ential difference in the materials of the churches, Jewi&s;h and Chri&s;tian.</Q> p. 27.&mdash; &mdash;True, that is my meaning; and what has he produced again&s;t it? Why he fir&s;t tries to reduce it to this ab&s;urdity; that I hold the ma|terials of the <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> church to be all gracious per&s;ons, and yet own that hypocrites do &s;ome|times <HI>creep</HI> into it; which con&s;equently puts an end to the di&s;tinction between <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> and <HI>invi&s;ible.</HI></P>
<P><Q>The&s;e, &s;ays he, are his &s;entiments &s;o far as I can &s;ee any thing of his meaning.</Q> Yet I did repeatedly an&s;wer this very objection, Ex. p. 57, 95. And Mr. <HI>F.</HI> has a remark upon a page in which I ob&s;erved that, The&s;e mini&s;ters <HI>confound</HI> the con&s;titution of the Jewi&s;h and Chri&s;tian chur|ches together, and &s;huffle and &s;hift from one to the other as occa&s;ion &s;uits, and then charge us with not di&s;tingui&s;hing between the <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> and <HI>in|vi&s;ible</HI> church. They allow that the invi&s;ible church contains none but the <HI>fir&s;t born which are written in heaven,</HI> Heb. 12.23. but they would have the vi&s;ible church contain abundance more;
<PB N="6" REF="012655_0005_0F8BBEDE2E01C560">and fly to the Jews, to parables, and to hypo|crites to &s;upport their notions. Whereas the proper notion of vi&s;ible is the making <HI>manife&s;t</HI> what was before invi&s;ible: hence &s;ays Paul, <HI>With the heart man believeth, and with the mouth con|fe&s;&s;ion is made;</HI> therefore an <HI>outward &s;hew</HI> of what is not <HI>invi&s;ibly real,</HI> is <HI>hypocri&s;y.</HI> The only rea&s;on why any get into the vi&s;ible church who are not born again, is not owing to the <HI>rule,</HI> but to the <HI>imperfection</HI> of men in acting upon it. Hence old Mr. <HI>Shepard,</HI> in an&s;wer to this que&s;tion, <HI>Do not hypocrites and no true members of Chri&s;t</HI> creep in? Says, <Q>Yes; but if they could have been known to be &s;uch they ought to be KEPT OUT; and when they are known, they are orderly to be CAST OUT. Mat. 25.1, 2 Tim. 3.5. Rev. 2.20. Tit. 3.10.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His &s;um of the Chri&s;tian Religion. p. 25. 26.</NOTE></P>
<P>The&s;e are my words; and I did hope that at lea&s;t the &s;entence of one of our learned fathers who compo&s;ed the <HI>Cambridge</HI> platform, would have had &s;ome weight with Mr. <HI>F.</HI> but no; that old beaten road mu&s;t be kept, let fathers or children be trampled upon ever &s;o much, yea and his eyes are &s;o dim that he &s;ays, "I dont &s;ee why Mr. <HI>B.</HI> <Q>may not ju&s;t as well &s;ay of Paul and his brethren in the mini&s;try, as he does of me and mine:&mdash;for who of all writers or preachers, does &s;o much as Paul and the other apo&s;tles, at connecting the Jewi&s;h and Chri&s;tian churches together; &s;hewing that the latter &s;prings out of the former; or rather, is but a continuation of the <HI>&s;ame</HI> church?</Q> p. 116. And are there no means to help our authors eye-&s;ight? Yes;
<PB N="7" REF="012655_0006_0F8BBEDEC344AB80">at the top of the &s;ame page he has helped mine, and I cant but hope to requite his kindne&s;s in the &s;ame way. I had quoted 2 Tim. 3.5, but was &s;o &s;hort-&s;ighted as to write, THE <HI>form of godline&s;s,</HI> in&s;tead of A <HI>form.</HI> This he corrects, and &s;ays, <Q>There is THE form of <HI>&s;ound words,</HI> which we are to <HI>hold fa&s;t;</HI> and &s;o THE form of divine &s;ervice which <HI>God</HI> has in&s;tituted to be religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved, and not trifled with. And there is A form of godline&s;s which <HI>man</HI> invents and &s;ets up, and &s;o not binding to chri&s;tians, widely different from THE form which is of God.</Q></P>
<P>I heartly thank Mr. <HI>F.</HI> for this correction, and that for two rea&s;ons; one is becau&s;e I am glad to get rid of my own mi&s;takes; the other is becau&s;e I hope to do him and others good by it, and for that end reque&s;t attention to the follow|ing particulars.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. THE form of <HI>&s;ound words,</HI> calls the cove|nant that con&s;tituted Abraham's hou&s;ehold into a church, <HI>The covenant of circumci&s;ion.</HI> Act. 7.8. But A form that man has invented calls it, <HI>The covenant of grace.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2 THE form of &s;ound words, calls Abraham's two &s;ons, with the mothers who bare them, an <HI>allegory</HI> of the TWO covenants, one of which the <HI>Jewi&s;h,</HI> the other the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> church &s;tood in. Gal. 4.22&mdash;31. But the words of mans invention, and which Mr. <HI>F.</HI> follows, &s;ay, <Q>The covenant that made the Jews the church of God is e&s;&s;entially the <HI>&s;ame</HI> in all ages,</Q> p. 39.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The form of &s;ound words &s;hews that circumci&s;ion was a <HI>&s;ign</HI> of Chri&s;t's death, and of an inward change, Col. 2.11. and that as Abraham had this change, and by faith
<PB N="8" REF="012655_0007_0F8BBEE38562B150"><HI>&s;aw</HI> and <HI>embraced</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John 8.56. Heb. 11.13.</NOTE> Chri&s;t <HI>before</HI> circumci&s;ion was in&s;tituted, it was a <HI>&s;eal</HI> of the <HI>faith that he had,</HI> when he was in <HI>uncircumci&s;ion,</HI> Rom. 4.10, 11. But man's wi&s;dom a&s;&s;erts that it was a <HI>&s;eal</HI> to that church in general, tho' it is never called &s;o in the &s;acred oracles.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. From Abraham's faith in Chri&s;t, <HI>before</HI> circumci&s;ion and other rites of the law were appointed, the apo&s;tle proves that his title to be <HI>heir of the world,</HI> &s;o that all believers &s;hould be called <HI>his children,</HI> was not thro' the Jewi&s;h covenant, but a <HI>better</HI> covenant, e&s;tabli&s;h|ed upon <HI>better promi&s;es,</HI> Rom. 4.12, 13. Gal. 3.16, 17. Heb. 8.6. Yet Mr. <HI>F.</HI> holds both cove|nants to be e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame. He allows a circum&s;tantial difference, and that the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation is <Q>more &s;piritual, &s;imple, and free from outward ceremonies.</Q> p. 35. More <HI>&s;piritual</HI> as to ordinances, but <HI>carnal</HI> as ever in materials; for he declares that <Q>There is no|thing in the con&s;titution of this new covenant, that nece&s;&s;arily requires a <HI>change</HI> of the <HI>mate|rials</HI> of the church.</Q> p. 36. Tho' THE form of &s;ound words, plainly makes &s;o great change in the materials, as there is between the children of Abraham's fle&s;h, and the <HI>children of God;</HI> and tells us that tho&s;e of his &s;eed which the Gentiles were grafted in among, were a <HI>remnant accord|ing to the election of grace;</HI> the <HI>re&s;t</HI> being <HI>broken off</HI> becau&s;e of <HI>unbelief,</HI> and tho&s;e who <HI>&s;tood,</HI> it was <HI>by faith,</HI> Rom. 9.8, and 11.5, 17, 20. There|fore,</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The greate&s;t difference between the cove|nant of circumci&s;ion, that God made with Abra|ham, and the new covenant which he made with
<PB N="9" REF="012655_0008_0F8BBEE5D3750888">his believing po&s;terity, lay in the <HI>materials</HI> of the church. The fir&s;t of his &s;eed who was cir|cumci&s;ed was an unbeliever; and when that co|venant was renewed, and the ordinance of the pa&s;&s;over was added, in <HI>the day</HI> that I&s;rael came out of Egypt, there was al&s;o a precept given, that when a <HI>&s;tranger</HI> would join with that church, <HI>let all his males be circumci&s;ed, and then let him come near and keep it.</HI> Exod. 12.48. But God &s;ays, the new covenant with the believing He|brews, is <HI>not according</HI> to the covenant he made with their fathers <HI>in that day;</HI> and the &s;pecial excellency of this new covenant is, that <HI>all &s;hall know him from the lea&s;t to the greate&s;t.</HI> Heb. 8.8&mdash;11. Here note; I&s;hmael did not know God tho' he was thirteen years old when he was con|&s;tituted one of the materials of that church, but it would not have an&s;wered &s;o well, to have placed the oppo&s;ition there, becau&s;e Abraham had no precept given him to admit <HI>&s;trangers</HI> by <HI>hou&s;holds;</HI> that was given in <HI>the day</HI> they came out of Egypt. So that as I &s;aid before, I cannot conceive it po&s;&s;ible, for words to expre&s;s more plainly than the&s;e do, that there is an e&s;&s;ential difference be|tween the materials, as well as the forms of the two churches.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>And what has Mr. <HI>F.</HI> &s;aid again&s;t this? Why he has taken up much time to prove, that the covenant of grace was always the &s;ame, and that God has brought &s;ome to know him in all ages (which I never denied) and then he both adds to, and takes from the word of God; and by that time he has got &s;o bewildered, as to deny his knowing any thing of what him&s;elf had tran&s;crib|ed ju&s;t above. This you will &s;ay is very &s;trange.
<PB N="10" REF="012655_0009_0F8BBEE6ED541C58">It is &s;o, but no more &s;trange than true. I have already proved that the word of truth calls the covenant which formed Abraham's hou&s;hold in|to a church, The covenant of circumci&s;ion; but Mr. <HI>F.</HI> takes this away, and <HI>adds</HI> the name <HI>grace</HI> to it, which is not put to it in the bible; and rea&s;ons upon it till he &s;ays, <Q>As for any expli|cit act or prohibition, forbidding children to come (into the chri&s;tian church with their believing parents) neither Mr. <HI>B.</HI> nor any other, that I know of, plead &s;uch a bar.</Q> p. 36. And yet he had tran&s;cribed in the &s;ame page, part of my plea of &s;uch a bar, becau&s;e God <HI>ex|pre&s;sly</HI> &s;ays, the new covenant is <HI>not according</HI> to that which he made in <HI>the day</HI> wherein he fir&s;t appointed &s;uch a practice. I am very &s;en&s;ible that children are freely called to come to Chri&s;t, and that 'tis a joyful thing to hear them cry, <HI>Ho&s;anna</HI> to him, which implies <HI>faith</HI> in him as the <HI>Saviour;</HI> but I do plead an explicit prohibition again&s;t bringing them to bapti&s;m before they profe&s;s this faith. For the fir&s;t admini&s;trator of bapti&s;m expre&s;sly required, <HI>fruits meet for repen|tance,</HI> and &s;aid to the Jews, <HI>Think not to &s;ay we have Abraham to our father.</HI> Mat. 3.8, 9. I am &s;en&s;ible that many will here tell us, that this re&s;pects men's coming upon a <HI>per&s;onal</HI> right. True it does &s;o; but then it is an explicit te&s;ta|mony that bapti&s;m is not a token of the <HI>&s;ame</HI> co|venant that circumci&s;ion was; for that covenant took in all the <HI>men</HI> of Abraham's hou&s;e &s;o &s;trict|ly, that if any one of them remained uncircum|ci&s;ed, <HI>that &s;oul &s;hould be cut off from his people.</HI> Gen. 17.14. Thus the covenant that con&s;titu|ted that church, took in all the <HI>men</HI> of Abraham's
<PB N="11" REF="012655_0010_0F8BBEE718C68F50">hou&s;e: and as the <HI>men</HI> of his hou&s;e, were thus warned not to <HI>think</HI> of coming to bapti&s;m upon their <HI>father's</HI> right; and as the Hebrews were expre&s;sly told, that the new covenant is <HI>not ac|cording</HI> to the covenant that was made in <HI>the day</HI> that fir&s;t opened a door for <HI>&s;trangers</HI> to bring, their <HI>hou&s;holds</HI> upon their faith; if all this does not lay an explicit bar again&s;t &s;uch a practice, I de&s;ire to know what can lay one?</P>
<P>I &s;hall now endeavour to con&s;ider all the force of Mr. <HI>Fi&s;h's</HI> arguments again&s;t this point, as di&s;tinctly as my capacity will admit of.</P>
<P N="1">1. He endeavours to prove that this <HI>new</HI> co|venant is &s;et in oppo&s;ition to the Sinai law, which neither took in nor ca&s;t out children, and not to Abraham's covenant, which he &s;ays, "was a pure covenant of grace." p. 29. And that infants, <Q>mu&s;t certainly hold their place in the church, &mdash;unle&s;s by &s;ome &s;pecial act of God, their pri|vilege is taken away; which is not to be pro|duced. Here then appears the <HI>fatal</HI> mi&s;take of Mr. <HI>B. fatal</HI> to his cau&s;e.</Q> p. 32. An&s;wer, if the taking away the name which the holy Gho&s;t has given to that covenant, and adding that of <HI>pure grace</HI> to it; and applying Gal. 3.17. thereto, in which the apo&s;tle expre&s;sly refers to Abraham's ju&s;tification by faith in Chri&s;t, <HI>before</HI> he took the <HI>bondwoman,</HI> by which he proves that the cove|nant of circumci&s;ion is now to cea&s;e when the <HI>&s;eed Chri&s;t</HI> is come. Gen. 12.3, and 15.6. Gal. 3.6, 8, 16, 17. and 4.31. If the&s;e things be duly examined, I believe the <HI>fatal</HI>-mi&s;take will be found to belong to his cau&s;e, and not mine: for this new covenant is &s;et in oppo&s;ition to what was done, in the day they came out of Egypt,
<PB N="12" REF="012655_0011_0F8BBEE7C5139B38">more directly than to what was done at Sinai, months or years afterward.</P>
<P N="2">2. Mr. <HI>F.</HI> quotes a number of texts out of the old te&s;tament which &s;peak the language of grace, and then &s;ays, <Q>I WILL and they SHALL, was ever the gracious word of God, or form of his covenant of grace; how then is this a <HI>bet|ter covenant,</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed upon <HI>better promi&s;es?</HI> as Mr. <HI>B.</HI> argues.</Q> p. 34. An&s;wer, I have already ob&s;erved, that the covenant of grace was always the &s;ame, and the language, <HI>I will</HI> and <HI>they &s;hall,</HI> in Abraham's covenant, in&s;ured the continuance of the church in the line of his po&s;|terity, till THE SEED &s;hould come <HI>to whom the pro|mi&s;e was made.</HI> Gal. 3.19. but then all that be|lieved not in him, were <HI>broken off</HI> from the church of God.</P>
<P N="3">3. Mr. <HI>F.</HI> grants this, but &s;till will have it that the chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation pre&s;erves the <HI>&s;ame ma|terials for kind,</HI> becau&s;e the new covenant is made with <HI>I&s;rael</HI> and <HI>Judah,</HI> p. 37. To which I reply, that I well know the go&s;pel church was fir&s;t con|&s;tituted of believing Jews; the &s;econd covenant was made with them, but then the covenant was <HI>new,</HI> and &s;o different from the fir&s;t, that Chri&s;t <HI>took the fir&s;t out of the way, nailing it to his cro&s;s,</HI> that he might <HI>e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;econd:</HI> and has charg|ed us to <HI>beware</HI> le&s;t any man, thro' <HI>philo&s;ophy and vain deceit,</HI> &s;ubject us to <HI>ordinances</HI> from tho&s;e <HI>rudiments.</HI> Col. 2.8, 14, 20. Heb. 10.9.</P>
<P N="4">4. Our author would have it, that the cove|nant is only circum&s;tantially and not e&s;&s;entially new; to prove which he refers us to the law of <HI>love,</HI> which is e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame in all ages; yet our Lord calls it <HI>new.</HI> becau&s;e he taught it more plainly, and pre&s;&s;ed it by <HI>new motives,</HI> p. 35.
<PB N="13" REF="012655_0012_0F8BBEE894EEB420">I fully concur with his premi&s;es, but not with his con&s;equence, for this new commandment is &s;o far from being <HI>oppo&s;ed</HI> to the old, that it is de|clared to be <HI>the old commandment</HI> which we had <HI>from the beginning.</HI> John 13.34. 1 John 2.7, 8. Whereas this new covenant is <HI>not according</HI> to the old one; and the difference is &s;o great that the fir&s;t of Abraham's &s;ons, and multitudes of tho&s;e who came after, were in their <HI>&s;ins,</HI> and did not <HI>know God,</HI> when they were taken into covenant, but the &s;ubjects of this new covenant <HI>all know him,</HI> and have their <HI>&s;ins forgiven.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Mr. <HI>F.</HI> holds this difference to be only gra|dual, and &s;ays, <Q>In go&s;pel times the ble&s;&s;ings of this new covenant were to i&s;&s;ue forth <HI>more abundantly.</HI></Q> p. 35.

I mu&s;t therefore once more turn him to his own corrections, and ob&s;erve, that THE form of the church which God has appointed &s;ays, <HI>They &s;hall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, &s;aying, Know the Lord; for</HI> ALL <HI>&s;hall know me, from the</HI> LEAST <HI>to the greate&s;t.</HI> Heb. 8.11. This is the covenant which Mr. <HI>F.</HI> &s;ays, makes the church <HI>what it is.</HI> And who is there that does not know, that the <HI>oracles of God</HI> which were the <HI>chief</HI> pri|vilege of the Jewi&s;h church, Rom. 3.2. were confined &s;o much thereto, that before Chri&s;t had taken that covenant away, and nailed it to his cro&s;s, he expre&s;sly forbid his apo&s;tles to preach to any but tho&s;e who were in it? yet after it was taken away he commanded them to <HI>teach all na|tions,</HI>

Mat. 10.5, 6, and 28.19. Mark 16.15, 16. So that the greate&s;t difference between the&s;e two covenants appears to be, that men mu&s;t have a &s;tanding in the fir&s;t, in order to have the free u&s;e of the means which ordinarily <HI>teach them to know God;</HI> while the&s;e means in a clearer light, are now freely u&s;ed with all nations, in order to bring them in|to the &s;econd covenant; and that none come into the church aright but &s;uch as knew him before.

<P>However I mu&s;t not forget that our author &s;ays, I mi&s;took his meaning. He tells us that his book treats of the church in a <HI>large</HI> &s;en&s;e, but that I take the word in the mo&s;t <HI>limited</HI> &s;en&s;e.

<P N="2">II. Of the go&s;pel <HI>manner of building</HI> churches.</P>
<P>I know Mr. <HI>F.</HI> &s;ays, <Q>I have really nothing to do with Mr. <HI>B.</HI> upon this head; 'tis out of the que&s;tion, as a <HI>particular</HI> church is not <HI>the church,</HI> which my &s;ermons treat of.</Q> p. 51. It may therefore be needful to enquire into the following things.</P>
<P N="1">1. Is any other vi&s;ible church-&s;tate in&s;tituted in the go&s;pel, but a particular one? <HI>The church</HI> &s;poken of by our Lord in Mat. 18.15,&mdash;18, is &s;uch an one as a brother can <HI>tell</HI> his grievance to; and whoever thought that could be to any other than a particular community? The &s;even churches of A&s;ia are &s;poken to by their great Head, not as one national or provincial church, but as &s;o many di&s;tinct churches, who are commended, or reproved by him, according as their <HI>works</HI> were, in each particular community. The church of
<PB N="18" REF="012655_0017_0F8BBEF2DDD29520">Corinth was reproved, for neglecting to <HI>judge</HI> &s;uch as were <HI>within,</HI> and not tho&s;e <HI>without</HI> their particular &s;ociety. 1 Cor. 5.12. And if Mr. <HI>F.</HI> was not treating of a particular church, what means his talk of the privilege of the baptized, as being under her authoritive watch and di&s;cipline? In truth our fathers were not a little puzzled with this que&s;tion. One of them that concurred with another who had gone before him, in <HI>re&s;olving</HI> to have an argument able to <HI>remove a mountain,</HI> before he would recede from infant bapti&s;m; and was <HI>peremptory</HI> for bringing per&s;ons to own the covenant, in order to bring their children to bapti&s;m, who did not &s;ee their way clear to come up to full communion; yet he confe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf not to be &s;o peremptory whether they were baptized as in a <HI>catholic,</HI> or in a <HI>particular</HI> church-&s;tate. But after much labour between him and others of great note upon it, they con|cluded to re&s;t the matter thus; <Q>That we are to di&s;tingui&s;h between a particular church, as it is more <HI>&s;trictly</HI> taken for a <HI>particular corpo|ration</HI> of covenanting believers, entru&s;ted by our Lord with the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and as it is more <HI>largely</HI> taken for that &s;pecial part of our Lord's vi&s;ible church, which doth <HI>&s;ub&s;i&s;t</HI> in this or that particular place.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Mitchel's life, p. 70, 78. and Dr. Increa&s;e Mather's, life. p. 54.</NOTE></Q> So that according to them, &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting in a particular <HI>place</HI> entitled &s;uch as would own the covenant to bapti&s;m and di&s;cipline, while the power to di&s;pen&s;e them belonged to the church more &s;trictly taken.

Note, he that believes <HI>in his heart, &s;hall be &s;aved;</HI> how daring then is it for any to argue that, a believ|ing with <HI>all the heart,</HI> can mean any lower kind of faith!</P>
<P N="3">3. How is this faith to be confe&s;&s;ed? The foregoing &s;criptures and many more &s;hew, that it was with the <HI>mouth</HI> or verbally; tho' many would have it to be general and not particular: to prove which the Eunuch's declaration is &s;ome|times produced. Not ob&s;erving, that Philip had immediate teaching from heaven to go to him, and got well acquainted with his &s;oul-exerci&s;es before this confe&s;&s;ion; nor the va&s;t difference there is between &s;aying, <HI>I believe that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the Son of God,</HI> now when a man would expo&s;e him&s;elf in the world to &s;ay the contrary; to what it was then, when that truth was &s;o much denied. Saints are often called God's witne&s;&s;es; and who does not know, that the general te&s;|timony from &s;uch is not ordinarily enough, but men want to hear in particular, how
<PB N="21" REF="012655_0020_0F8BBEF48FF95B00">they came to the knowledge of what they te&s;tify? Hence, tho' Peter had immediate direction from above to go to Cornelius, yet when he came he would have from <HI>his mouth</HI> an account how he came to &s;end for him. And when the church at Jeru&s;alem wanted &s;atisfaction of Peter about that matter, he did not turn them off with a general declarati|on, that the holy Gho&s;t &s;ent him, and owned him; tho' he had a much better claim to be credited by that church, than common per&s;ons now have to be credited by a church they would join with: but in&s;tead of turning them off with generals, Peter <HI>rehear&s;ed the matter from the be|ginning, and expounded it by order unto them.</HI> Acts: 11.4. And as our Lord has commanded his di&s;ciples, not to give <HI>holy things</HI> to unholy crea|tures, and to <HI>beware</HI> of fal&s;e prophets, &s;aying, <HI>ye &s;hall know them by their fruits.</HI> Mat. 7.6, 15, 16. &s;o he has explained tho&s;e fruits to be, what is <HI>brought forth</HI> out of the <HI>heart</HI> by <HI>&s;peaking.</HI> Luk. 6.45. and John &s;ays, <HI>That which we have &s;een and heard, declare we unto you, that ye al&s;o may have fellow&s;hip with us.</HI> And do not the&s;e things &s;ufficiently prove that the go&s;pel method of pro|fe&s;&s;ing our faith, is by a particular declaring of it with our mouths?</P>
<P N="4">4. To whom is the declaration to be made? Mr. <HI>F.</HI> refers us to a clau&s;e in Cambridge pla|form where they &s;ay, in ca&s;e of <Q>exce&s;&s;ive fear,&mdash; 'tis &s;ufficient that the <HI>elders,</HI> having received <HI>private</HI> &s;atisfaction, make relation thereof in public before the church.</Q> p. 51.

For there is no point more expre&s;sly forbidden by our Lord, than for mini&s;ters to a&s;|&s;ume a power <HI>like civil rulers.</HI> Mat. 20.25&mdash;27. Mark 10.42&mdash;44.

In reference to which, as I came acro&s;s his u&s;e of the word extraordinary in another ca&s;e, I in&s;erted a note upon the great things that were done by that word, and &s;aid, <Q>The power of Chri&s;t in <HI>qualifying</HI> men for mini&s;try, without going to colleges for them, is hereby limitted to the apo&s;tles days; and all are rejected with con|tempt by Mr. <HI>F.</HI> who do not receive their <HI>gifts</HI> at <HI>college,</HI> and their <HI>authority</HI> from <HI>authorized</HI> hands, p. 15&mdash;17, and the&s;e authorized hands, by the help of this word have got &s;uch an

For the apo&s;tles were only <HI>witne&s;&s;es</HI> for Chri&s;t, and as &s;uch pointed out to the church, what qualifications officers &s;hould have, and &s;aid, <HI>Brethren look ye out among you</HI> &s;uch men. Acts 1.8. and 6.3. But the&s;e pretended &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors of the apo&s;tles, a&s;&s;ume a power to limit the church, in her choice to &s;uch as they have <HI>approbated;</HI> which I tru&s;t will be made evident to be a power which the apo&s;tles never had.</Q> Ex. p. 24, 25.</P>
<P>The reader may note, that here I &s;pake of the qualifying, approbating, and choice of officers; but Mr. <HI>F.</HI> pa&s;&s;es over what I <HI>&s;aid,</HI> and pre|&s;umes to tell what I <HI>meant:</HI> for he &s;ays, <Q>'tis evident Mr. <HI>B.</HI> there means a power of or|daining officers in the church.</Q> And &s;o fix|ing upon what I neither &s;aid nor meant in that place, he accu&s;es me with <Q>keeping back the principal words in the text, as it relates to the pre&s;ent que&s;tion:</Q> and with affirming that the apo&s;tles, "never had <HI>power</HI> to ordain;"&mdash;with a <Q>pre&s;umptuous handling of the holy &s;criptures, and a daring corrupting of the &s;en&s;e of them,</Q> &amp;c. p. 65, 66. The way he takes to try to prove that I meant what I did not expre&s;s, is to tell the reader that I refer to a page in his book that treats of ordination; as if I had referred to but one page; whereas my re|ference was exactly as I have now laid it before the reader, who will judge whether I have injured the truth or not, &s;ince the apo&s;tles only de&s;crib|ed what tho&s;e officers qualifications and work &s;hould be, and then called the church to <HI>look them out;</HI> and the church did &s;o, and <HI>they</HI> &s;et
<PB N="26" REF="012655_0025_0F8BBEFC32CFEB58">tho&s;e whom they had looked out, <HI>before</HI> the a|po&s;tles. But the modern method is, for &s;uch as <HI>de&s;ire</HI> to be mini&s;ters, <HI>humbly</HI> to <HI>pre&s;ent them&s;elves</HI> before officers to be approbated; and the church is limited, in her choice of mini&s;ters, to &s;uch candidates.</P>
<P>This Mr. <HI>F.</HI> cannot deny, but after &s;aying much upon it, he comes to the&s;e words; <Q>Al|though we think the affair of examination and judging of the qualifications of candidates for the mini&s;try, is committed to the <HI>mini&s;ters,</HI> by the Head of the churches, yet we neither arrogate it <HI>wholly</HI> to our&s;elves, as Mr. <HI>B.</HI> char|ges, i. e. &s;o as to exclude the people from try|ing and judging and choo&s;ing for them&s;elves; nor do we ever pretend to <HI>impo&s;e</HI> upon <HI>them,</HI> tho&s;e whom we examine and approbate.</Q> p. 82. Reply: What I charged them with, he is here forced to own; and though his mind was &s;o intent upon mini&s;terial power, as not to men|tion the churches choice, in the page which he &s;ays treats of ordination, yet I did not &s;uppo&s;e that he excluded the people from a choice a|mong their candidates; and to &s;ay I charge them therewith, is what I deny, and let him prove it if he can. This art of &s;lipping in &s;omething which does not belong to the ca&s;e in hand, to prevent its appearing in its true light, is a dreadful part of the <HI>learning</HI> of our world. Not only &s;o, but he has al&s;o proved him&s;elf <HI>in|excu&s;ably</HI> guilty of the <HI>&s;ame thing</HI> that he unju&s;t|ly charged upon me; namely, of keeping back principal words of &s;cripture, on which the pre&s;ent que&s;tion depended. For when I produced our Lord's commendation of the church of Ephe|&s;us,

<P>So when I ob&s;erved that in Paul's day, letters of commendation were <HI>to</HI> and <HI>from the church;</HI> but proved that &s;ome mini&s;ters in our land claim a power like civil rulers, contrary to the expre&s;s command of Chri&s;t, and then &s;aid, If mini&s;ters would leave their <HI>worldly</HI> compari&s;ons, and attend wholly to divine rule, I believe they would find that it belongs to the church <HI>with</HI> them to try mini&s;ters.

<P>From approbation we now come to ordination; and I ob&s;erve that the grand point wherein he accu&s;es me with perverting &s;cripture is my &s;aying the apo&s;tles were only <HI>witne&s;&s;es;</HI> <Q>which (&s;ays he) every one knows are per&s;ons that act in a very different character from tho&s;e who <HI>appoint, &s;et</HI>

<P>An&s;wer 2.

Therefore let our author and others con&s;ider well, where men have got to, who plead for <HI>power</HI> to "act-in a <HI>character</HI> very different from" that which the Son of God gave to his apo&s;tles, and to later mini&s;ters. The gift of God which Timo|thy received by the putting on of Paul's hands, and which he was called to <HI>&s;tir up,</HI> was <HI>not the &s;pirit of fear, but of</HI> POWER, <HI>and of</HI> LOVE, <HI>and of a</HI> SOUND MIND. A <HI>power</HI> to keep him from being <HI>a&s;hamed of the</HI> TESTIMONY <HI>of our Lord,</HI> or of his &s;uffering &s;ervants. A power to <HI>hold fa&s;t the form of &s;ound words in faith and love which is in Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> at a time when many <HI>turned away</HI> from that cau&s;e. 2 Tim. 1.6&mdash;8, 13&mdash;15.

<P>Now you may remember that Dr. <HI>Owen</HI> (as quoted a little back) tells us, that the utmo&s;t pretence and defence of the Romani&s;ts, to &s;ecure their dominion is, That it is not dominion ab|&s;olutely that is forbidden, but the <HI>unlawful ty|ranical</HI> exerci&s;e of power.

Then from an old book he mentions the names of &s;ome in each century; and I ob&s;erve that <HI>bapti&s;ts</HI> mini&s;ters will do as wellas any, if people do not know them to be &s;uch.

<PB N="33" REF="012655_0032_0F8BBF02E0E445D8">to the plain &s;cripture example which ash been produced, he ought not, either as <HI>polluted</HI> to be put from the mini&s;try, or el&s;e own him|&s;elf to have been unju&s;t in blaming, both our fathers and us, for holding the power of ordina|tion to be in the church?

<P N="4">IV. Of the difference between civil and eccle|&s;ia&s;tical government.</P>
<P>In opening the con&s;titution of tho&s;e which Mr. <HI>F.</HI> calls &s;tanding churches, I produced ma|ny facts, to &s;hew how civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical af|fairs have been confounded together in our coun|try; which has done amazing mi&s;chief, and was the wor&s;t mi&s;take that our fathers brought to this land. I fully declared <HI>for a harmony</HI> between the church and &s;tate, but <HI>again&s;t &s;uch a union</HI> be|tween them, as has been practi&s;ed among us. Ex. p. 23.</P>
<P>In reply Mr. <HI>F.</HI> blames me much for not let|ting the&s;e matters re&s;t as our fathers had left them, while yet he has not the courage to ju&s;tify all their conduct, nor to run the line, or fix the bound between the two powers, better than they did; and &s;ays, "This is too delicate an affair "for me to attempt." p. 56. Then he goes on to prove, what I never in the lea&s;t denied, that the Jewi&s;h church and &s;tate were united, while yet their acts as to civil polity, and religi|ous wor&s;hip, were kept di&s;tinct. p. 56.57. Yet from this and &s;ome other things he tries to con|fute, or el&s;e to confound me.</P>
<P>Two things therefore appear nece&s;&s;ary here to be con&s;idered; which are, how the civil rulers in I&s;rael did behave toward the church, and what the difference is betwixt us and them.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="012655_0033_0F8BBF03A06EE6F8">
Fir&s;t, how did I&s;rael's civil rulers behave to|ward the church? This may be an&s;wered in two branches.</P>
<P N="1">1. As to a place and furniture for wor&s;hip. Tho' their great Lawgiver could, had he &s;een fit, as exactly have proportioned each man's part of the expence, as to have given the <HI>pattern</HI> of what was to be made; yet in&s;tead of that, after giving notice of what was wanted, he &s;aid, Who|&s;oever is of a <HI>willing</HI> heart, let <HI>him bring an Off|ring unto the Lord,</HI> gold, &s;ilver, &amp;c. Exod. 35.5. And when their co&s;tly temple was to be built. David like a <HI>nur&s;ing father,</HI> led the way, and of his <HI>own proper goods,</HI> offered very largely; and then exhorted his people to do the like; which had &s;uch effect, as cau&s;ed him with grateful won|der to &s;ay. <Q>As for me in the uprightne&s;s of my heart I have <HI>willingly</HI> offered all the&s;e things; and now have I &s;een with joy, thy people which are pre&s;ent here, to offer <HI>willingly unto thee.</HI></Q> 1 Chron. 29.3, 17.</P>
<P>Who can fail to ob&s;erve, that here it appears, both in the provi&s;ion that was made for the ta|bernacle, and for the temple, that what was done was <HI>offered to the Lord,</HI> and that, as each one found a <HI>willing heart,</HI> without any pre&s;cribing or compelling in either case? Indeed half a &s;hekel was pre&s;cribed for each man to offer, to make attonement for his &s;oul, in which the rich &s;hould not give more, nor the poor le&s;s. Exod. 30.15. Importing that all &s;ouls are of equal value; which money was for the &s;ervice of the tabernacle. And when the temple needed repair|ing in after times, the king &s;aid to the prie&s;ts, all this money, and all the money that <HI>cometh into

But they being ne|gligent of their duty, the king reproved them for it; and at his commandment they prepared a che&s;t, and &s;at it in the gate of the hou&s;e, and made a <HI>proclamation</HI> through Judah and Jeru&s;a|lem, to <HI>bring in to the Lord</HI> the collection that Mo&s;es commanded.

<P>Mini&s;ters, as di&s;tinct from other &s;aints, are never called prie&s;ts in the new-te&s;tament; there|fore the power of the ancient prie&s;ts to govern in the hou&s;e of God, is an argument for, and not again&s;t the government of Chri&s;t's hou&s;e, being in the church as a body. In all civil govern|ments, from the greate&s;t empires to our common families, &s;ome have power to <HI>judge for others,</HI> which power others ought to <HI>&s;ubmit to;</HI> but our Lord has mo&s;t plainly forbidden, either the a&s;&s;u|ming or &s;ubmitting to any &s;uch thing in religion.

<P>I ob&s;erved that the <HI>offerings</HI> of the people, out of which ancient mini&s;ters were fed, were as dif|ferent from civil contracts, as their own hou&s;es were from the temple. Ex. p. 79.

I have before produced in&s;tances, both of kings and prophets, reproving and &s;tirring up, prie&s;ts and people, each to their re&s;pective duties concerning religious wor&s;hip; but does that make, either its performance, or its &s;upport to

But will Mr. <HI>F.</HI> hold it to be &s;o with his <HI>bodily exerci&s;e,</HI> when he "reads, writes, vi&s;its, prays or preaches?" p. 94.

<P>But what is there in all this, to favor their a&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing the people to &s;upport mini&s;ters, and u&s;ing <HI>force</HI> to collect it? Indeed my opponent does not like this word, and the facts that I related agreable to it, he calls "horrible things." p. 111. And he chu&s;es the more &s;oft and ambiguous word, <HI>oblige.</HI> p. 63, 96. Tho' if he had felt the effect of it as much as we have, I am per&s;uaded that <HI>force,</HI> and <HI>violence</HI> added to the end of it, would appear to him mild enough to &s;et their conduct in its true light.</P>
<P>I before declared, that the &s;cripture is abun|dantly clear for a <HI>free</HI> &s;upport of mini&s;ters, but not a <HI>forced</HI> one; and ob&s;erved, that there is as much difference between them, as there is between the power of <HI>truth</HI> in the mind, and the power of the <HI>&s;word</HI> on the body. Ex. p. 27. Mr. <HI>F.</HI> is &s;o far from concurring with that ob&s;er|vation, that he &s;ays, I <HI>corrupted</HI> the &s;en&s;e of Mat. 11.5, only becau&s;e I &s;aid, We u&s;ed to <HI>think</HI> the go&s;pel was preached <HI>freely to the poor.</HI> The word <HI>freely,</HI> he &s;ays, is not in the text. p. 64. I did not &s;ay, it was expre&s;&s;ed there, but in the preceeding page I had quoted Chri&s;t's orders to his mini&s;ters, <HI>Freely ye have received, freely give.</HI> Mat. 10.8, 14. Ex. p. 24, 25. which I conclu|ded they obeyed: but Mr. <HI>F.</HI> would have it, that the&s;e orders had <HI>no reference</HI> to preaching, but only to working miracles. p. 61. and the word <HI>freely</HI> he &s;ays, <Q>Is a <HI>capital</HI> word in the pre&s;ent di&s;pute; the controver&s;y in this place turns upon it.</Q> p. 64, 65. So it does; and where he will turn to &s;ave his &s;cheme I know not;
<PB N="46" REF="012655_0045_0F8BBF13675F77C0">for he had declared, that the fal&s;e apo&s;tles <HI>gloried</HI> in preaching <HI>freely,</HI> to prove which he brought 2 Cor. 11.12. But I attempted to &s;hew that their glorying was in things of another nature; that as Paul, when he fir&s;t came to Corinth, wrought at tent-making, on weak days, and preached on the &s;abbath, <HI>not with enticing words of man's wi&s;dom:</HI> they <HI>commended them&s;elves,</HI> and &s;aid of him, <HI>His bodily pre&s;ence is weak, and his &s;peech contemptible.</HI> Ex. p. 25. This interpreta|tion Mr. <HI>F.</HI> di&s;likes; and in order to prove that the <HI>fal&s;e</HI> apo&s;tles gloried in preaching <HI>freely,</HI> he has fully proved that the <HI>true</HI> apo&s;tle did &s;o; and if he could have brought the text to &s;ay, <HI>Wherein</HI> WE <HI>glory,</HI> in&s;tead of, <HI>wherein</HI> THEY <HI>glory,</HI> it would have an&s;wered his end; but that was beyond his power. p. 66, 69. Therefore I think the argument &s;tands thus: Mr. <HI>F.</HI> &s;ays, Chri&s;t's order to his apo&s;tles, <HI>Freely give,</HI> had <HI>no reference to preaching,</HI> and that I corrupted a text, by &s;aying, We <HI>thought</HI> they preached &s;o; yet Mr. <HI>F.</HI> has clearly proved that a <HI>true</HI> apo&s;tle did <HI>glory</HI> in <HI>preaching freely,</HI> but has failed of proving any &s;uch thing of the <HI>fal&s;e</HI> ones!</P>
<P>The rea&s;on he gives for confining the word <HI>freely</HI> to working miracles, in Chri&s;t's order to his fir&s;t mini&s;ters, is becau&s;e he &s;ays, <HI>The workman is worthy of his meat;</HI> and, the <HI>labourer is worthy of his hire;</HI> which words, <HI>workmen</HI> and <HI>labourer,</HI> are in other places u&s;ed concerning common mi|ni&s;terial labours, where no miracles are in que&s;ti|on. Be it &s;o, yet 'tis nothing to his purpo&s;e, for the ver&s;e he quotes which &s;ays, The labourer is worthy of hire, al&s;o de&s;cribes how they &s;hould come at it, namely, by receiving <HI>&s;uch things as
<PB N="47" REF="012655_0046_0F8BBF194CE5C200">they give.</HI> Luke 10.7. And the texts that he adds with our fathers comments thereon, all &s;peak the &s;ame language. 1 Cor. 9.9&mdash;14. which &s;ays, <HI>Even &s;o hath the Lord ordained;</HI> refers to ancient mini&s;ters being maintained out of the <HI>offerings</HI> of the people. And Gal. 6.6, &s;ays, <HI>Let him that is taught in the word, communicate unto him that teacheth, in all good-things.</HI> Not let the collector <HI>take it,</HI> if he will <HI>not give it.</HI> Next they cite a pa&s;&s;age which &s;ays, <HI>As God hath pro&s;pered him.</HI> What is to be done as God hath pro&s;pered him? an&s;wer, a <HI>collection</HI> of <HI>liberality for the &s;aints at Jeru&s;alem.</HI> 1 Cor. 16, 1&mdash;3. The&s;e are our mini&s;ters proofs for not being maintained by <HI>free gift;</HI> to which they add Neh. 13.11. to prove that <Q>when the church power cannot attain the end, the magi&s;trate is to &s;ee that the mini&s;try be duly provided for.</Q> p. 63. The text &s;hews that Nehemiah u&s;ed reproofs and expo&s;tulations in the affair; and the effect was this: <HI>Then bro't all Judah the tithe. All</HI> Judah were their own collectors; and it proves clearly, that Nehemiah u&s;ed his influence by reproof, in&s;truction and good example, to move both mini&s;ters and peo|ple, faithfully to di&s;charge their re&s;pective duties in religion: and Oh that all rulers, and &s;ubjects too, would do the like!</P>
<P>But, &s;ay our mini&s;ters, it is a <HI>due debt,</HI> therefore if the people will not pay it, the magi&s;trate is to interpo&s;e and <HI>oblige</HI> them to do it. p. 63. An&s;wer, both mini&s;ters and people <HI>owe</HI> their all to God, and when they have done all that he has com|manded, they ought to realize and acknowledge, that they are <HI>unprofitable &s;ervants.</HI> He has plain|ly de&s;cribed in his word, both what mini&s;ters, and
<PB N="48" REF="012655_0047_0F8BBF1BD301A960">what people are to do, relating to his wor&s;hip; and &s;ays to each, <HI>I know thy works.</HI> And <HI>with him we have to do.</HI> Heb. 4.13. And when he &s;ays, <HI>Let him that is taught in the word, communi|cate to him that teacheth in all good things;</HI> to enforce it he &s;ays, <HI>Be not deceived,</HI> GOD IS NOT MOCKED; <HI>for what&s;oever a man &s;oweth that &s;hall he reap.</HI> Gal. 6.6&mdash;7.</P>
<P>It is in vain to mince the matter. I am as &s;en&s;ible as Mr. <HI>F.</HI> is, that the body is much exer|ci&s;ed in mini&s;terial labours, and that God has commanded his people to communicate to them of their <HI>carnal things;</HI> yet the obedience of both, is what they <HI>owe to God,</HI> who can either pro&s;per or bla&s;t them as he plea&s;es; yea, can <HI>this night require the &s;oul of him who layeth up trea&s;ure for</HI> HIMSELF, <HI>and is not</HI> RICH TOWARDS GOD. Luke 12.20&mdash;21. And if <HI>money</HI> or <HI>worldly property,</HI> be the <HI>con&s;ideration</HI> in the covenant between any mini&s;ter and his people, what are they doing but <HI>&s;owing to the fle&s;h?</HI> therefore <HI>be not deceived.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;um of the matter is evidently this. All orders of men ought to do what they can in their &s;everal &s;tations to promote religion, by &s;peaking and practi&s;ing the <HI>truth in love,</HI> but have no war|rant to u&s;e any force therein: the exact limits between eccle&s;ia&s;tical and civil government being this, That the <HI>church</HI> is armed with <HI>light</HI> and <HI>truth,</HI> to pull down &s;atan's &s;trong holds, and gain &s;ouls to Chri&s;t, and into his church, to be gover|ned by his rules therein; and again to exclude &s;uch from their communion, who will not be &s;o governed: while the <HI>&s;tate</HI> is armed with the <HI>&s;word</HI> to guard the peace, and civil rights of all
<PB N="49" REF="012655_0048_0F8BBF1CAC242FA8">per&s;ons and &s;ocieties, and to <HI>revenge</HI> and <HI>execute wrath</HI> on tho&s;e who violate the &s;ame.</P>
<P>And if none but <HI>Sons of Beliel</HI> ever pre&s;umed, even under the <HI>legal</HI> di&s;pen&s;ation, &s;o far to inter|fere between God and his people, about &s;upport|ing mini&s;ters, as to &s;ay, if you will not <HI>give</HI> it I will <HI>take it by force;</HI> how great mu&s;t their blind|ne&s;s be, who can pre&s;ume to do &s;o, under the di&s;pen&s;ation which is <HI>purely evangelical!</HI> And I earne&s;tly be&s;eech my dear countrymen, to con&s;i|der how <HI>inexcu&s;able</HI> we &s;hall appear in <HI>judging,</HI> if we continue to do, not the <HI>&s;ame</HI> but <HI>wor&s;e</HI> things, than we <HI>condemn</HI> in others!</P>
<P>How much have our rulers, mini&s;ters and peo|ple, complained of <HI>oppre&s;&s;ion,</HI> becau&s;e of the at|tempts that have been made, again&s;t the right of <HI>giving</HI> our money, either by our&s;elves or our repre&s;entatives, to &s;upport government! but if the right thus to <HI>give</HI> it, is e&s;&s;ential to <HI>liberty</HI> in <HI>civil</HI> government, where <HI>force</HI> belongs (as I believe it is) what oppre&s;&s;ion mu&s;t it be, to deprive any of the <HI>liberty</HI> of <HI>giving</HI> their money <HI>freely</HI> to pro|mote <HI>religion,</HI> where <HI>force</HI> has no place at all! And as we have proved it to be contrary to our Lord's commandment, to call any man on earth <HI>ma&s;ter</HI> or <HI>father,</HI> it being impo&s;&s;ible for us to con|&s;titute another to an&s;wer for us at his bar; there|fore we connot convey a right to a repre&s;entative to <HI>compel</HI> any per&s;on, either to attend, or to &s;up|port a wor&s;hip contrary to his con&s;cience. And our fathers example in the&s;e things, will condemn, rather than excu&s;e us, in &s;o doing; for while they thought <HI>force</HI> was warrantable in &s;uch affairs, they were zealous in the <HI>compelling</HI> per&s;ons to <HI>conform,</HI> to what they e&s;teemed the right way of
<PB N="50" REF="012655_0049_0F8BBF1D055520A8">wor&s;hip, as well as to <HI>&s;upport</HI> it: and if the for|mer was per&s;ecution, what cloak can be left for the latter! Some tell us, that money is not con&s;cience: that we know as well as they, but they &amp; all will know, &s;ooner or later, that we all are but <HI>&s;tewards</HI> of what we profe&s;s, and mu&s;t give account thereof to the great Lord of all; con|&s;equently it mu&s;t be a matter of con&s;cience to tho&s;e who view things as they are, not voluntarily to &s;upport a wor&s;hip, which they believe is not right.

Bro|thers H. and S. were brought there the next night. We lay in pri&s;on 13 days, and then were &s;et at liberty, by what means I know not. Whil&s;t I was there a great many people came to &s;ee me, and &s;ome &s;aid one thing, and &s;ome another: O! the innumerable &s;nares and temptations that be&s;et me, more than I ever tho't on before! But O, the conde&s;cention of heaven! tho' I was bound when I was ca&s;t into this furnace, yet was I loo&s;ed, and found Je&s;us in the mid&s;t of the furnace with me. O! then I could give up my name, e&s;tate, family, life and breath, freely to God. Now the pri&s;on look'd like a palace to me. I could ble&s;s God for all the laughs and &s;coffs made at me.

<P>And.</P>
<P N="1">I. I think we have already produced &s;uffici|ent proof, that according to Chri&s;t's in&s;titution, none ought to be received into the church without go&s;pel evidence of their &s;aving union to the great Head of it. The Jewi&s;h church was di&s;tingui&s;hed from the nations of the <HI>world</HI> by their being <HI>cho&s;en</HI> of God as a <HI>nation,</HI> and by the ordinances that he gave to keep them di&s;tinct from all other nations; But our Lord has bro|ken down that wall of <HI>partition;</HI> and through the new-te&s;tament he di&s;tingui&s;hes his church from the world, by <HI>choo&s;ing them out of the world,</HI> and giv|ing them to <HI>know God</HI> which is <HI>eternal life,</HI> whom the <HI>world hath not known.</HI> John 15.19. and 17.3, 25.1 John 5.19, 20.

<P>But if to pretend a willingne&s;s to relea&s;e the church till they had got their mini&s;ter ordained, and then to treat them as they did, be not like the <HI>wicked world,</HI> I de&s;ire to know what can be!

<P>Now kind reader &s;ee where we are.

<P>I before quoted Dr. <HI>Owen's</HI> ob&s;ervation concern|ing national churches, that tho' they talk of <HI>liberty of con&s;cience,</HI> yet when it comes to the i&s;&s;ue, all choice is prevented, and in the church where a man was <HI>baptized in infancy,</HI> and in the <HI>pari&s;h</HI> where his habitation falls, in that <HI>pari&s;h-church</HI> he mu&s;t wor&s;hip, or be dealt with as a <HI>&s;chi&s;matick.</HI> Then I produced this ca&s;e at Canterbury, and proved, that two members of that church were dealt with and expelled Yale-college as &s;chi&s;mat|icks, only for meeting for wor&s;hip with the church they belonged to, in a place &s;eparate from the pa|ri&s;h meeting-hou&s;e; and tho&s;e who expelled them declared to the world that, <Q>Neither the major part of the members in full communion, nor <HI>any other per&s;ons,</HI> in any pari&s;h, have <HI>any right</HI> to appoint any hou&s;e or place for wor&s;hip on the &s;abbath, <HI>&s;eparate</HI> from, and in oppo&s;ition to the meeting-hou&s;e, the public place appointed

<P>But Mr. <HI>F.</HI> &s;ays <Q>That relates ONLY to the <HI>placing</HI> of meeting-hou&s;es,&mdash;and &s;o is a matter of a <HI>civil</HI> nature; but don't &s;o much as <HI>touch</HI> the principles, the order, di&s;cipline and govern|ment of the churches;</Q> and he a&s;&s;erts that my la&s;t &s;entence is "evidently void of TRUTH." p. 103, 104.

<P>By Mr. <HI>F's</HI> own account, a certain quantity of worldly e&s;tate gives every inhabitant power, by their con&s;titution, to vote for mini&s;ters, and all the ad|vantage that the members in full communion have above the re&s;t is that they may vote with the world if they have no e&s;tate; and he &s;ays <Q>All vote in our pari&s;hes, as men <HI>qualified by law;</HI> and as Mr. <HI>B.</HI> brings in the <HI>clergy</HI> with the <HI>world,</HI> with a de&s;ign to do them a mi&s;chief, he makes a terrible overthrow; &s;laying clergy and laity, &s;tanding churches and &s;eparates, all with one &s;troke: but no matter for that&mdash;if the mini&s;ters &amp;their churches may but fall, he &s;eems willing that he and his brethren, <HI>Samp&s;on-like</HI> &s;hould die with the <HI>Phili&s;tines.</HI></Q> p. 83, 84.

It is not doubted but that many have come out from tho&s;e called &s;tanding churches in our land, who did not act upon the&s;e principles, but have been influenced by ourward appearances, or unrea&s;onable impre&s;&s;ions, rather than an un|der&s;tanding regard to divine truth? and which has cau&s;ed a great deal of trouble and &s;earching trials among us, and given occa&s;ion to our ene|mies. Yet all the errors in the world cannot overthrow the truth, nor excu&s;e us if we do not obey it; and it is &s;o far from being <HI>truce-breaking,</HI> to withdraw from mini&s;ters and churches, when we &s;ee that they gro&s;sly &s;werve from the truth, and will not be reclaimed, that we can not keep covenant, either with God or them, but by &s;uch a withdraw.</P>
<P N="2">2. This our opponents allow, but deny our having any &s;uch cau&s;e to withdraw from them. And to try to &s;upport their argument, they col|lect all the good things, or good pretences that they can find on their &s;ide; and then all the errors and evils that they can &s;ee or hear of among &s;epa|rates. But what work would it make, if we &s;hould requite them in the &s;ame way, and draw their character to the world from the fal&s;e-teaching. lying, whoredoms, drunkenne&s;s and other abomi|nations, that in fact have happened among their mini&s;ters and churches! yet there would be as much ju&s;tice in &s;o doing, as in a very great part of what they have done to us in the&s;e affairs. Mr. <HI>F.</HI> told the world, that his de&s;ign was to draw the &s;eparates <HI>pictures to the life,</HI> that they
<PB N="70" REF="012655_0069_0F8BBF36BA494F78">might be a&s;hamed. Ser. p. 130. In doing of which he collected the wor&s;t things that he could find among any that bore the name; yea, I am told by a gentleman of note in Stonington, that one in&s;tance of ill treatment to him which he has publi&s;hed, was from a woman that never was of either the &s;eparate church or &s;ociety, only as &s;he happened to live then at one of their hou&s;es. At the &s;ame time he &s;ays, <Q>I know not of <HI>one</HI> princi|ple or practice among them, that is agreable to the go&s;pel, but what they <HI>learned in our chur|ches.</HI>" Ser. p. 113. Whatever good things they have among them, they have them not <HI>as &s;eparates,</HI>&mdash;the things that I have told you of above, are their <HI>characteri&s;ticks.</HI></Q> Ser. p. 160.</P>
<P>Since he talks &s;o much about learning, I think to make a little trial of what &s;ome of their rules of logic will do in this affair; as thus,</P>
<P>Every cau&s;e will produce its own effects. Mr. <HI>F.</HI> gives a dreadful account of how roughly the &s;eparates treated him, &s;oon after they came out of the &s;tanding churches. But when they had been out above 20 years, he &s;ays <Q>They are now, much more moderate and civil, than they were in that day; are very peacable, kind, obliging good neighbours.</Q> Ser. p. 157, 158.</P>
<P>Ergo, they have received better teaching &s;ince they came out than they had before. Again,</P>
<P>Take away the cau&s;e, and the effect will cea&s;e, Mr. <HI>F.</HI> tells the world, that the &s;pecial occa&s;ion of publi&s;hing his &s;ermons, was <Q>The revival of the &s;pirit of &s;eparation and annabapti&s;m.</Q> Pre|face. p. 3.</P>
<P>Ergo, the &s;pirit of our &s;eparation when revi|ved, was a &s;pirit of civility, peace and good nei|bourhood,
<PB N="71" REF="012655_0070_0F8BBF3B31B61AD0">and all his repre&s;entations to the con|trary are unju&s;t and abu&s;ive, for which he is con|demned out of his own mouth.</P>
<P N="3">3. The only way to bring this controver&s;y to a fair i&s;&s;ue, is to examine the true nature and effects of our profe&s;&s;ed principles, or &s;hew wherein we do not act agreable to them. This I have aim|ed at in all the&s;e labours, and de&s;ire others to do the &s;ame with me. If any man can &s;hew us where|in we hold any wrong principle, or in a friendly manner correct any di&s;agreable practice, he will do us a real kindne&s;s; but to charge us with any thing that we are con&s;cious we do not hold, can never convince us that we are wrong, or they right.</P>
<P N="4">4. It has ever been &s;atan's method, when he could no longer keep people ea&s;y with the dead carca&s;e of religion, than to promote in &s;ome, great pretences of &s;pirituality which are not true; which formali&s;ts have never failed to improve as an argument again&s;t reformation. How much have papi&s;ts u&s;ed this argument again&s;t prote&s;|tants, and epi&s;copalians again&s;t puritans and di&s;|&s;enters? And is not the &s;ame now u&s;ed again&s;t us? That there has been much enthu&s;ia&s;m, and many fal&s;e pretences to &s;pirituality in our day, is a melancholy fact; but it is quite as injurious to lay the blame thereof to the main principles, or chief leaders of our &s;eparation, as it would be to the chief in&s;truments of the revival of religion in 1741; for there were as bad or wor&s;e things of that nature, that happened before our &s;epara|tion, than have &s;ince. Therefore it appeared needful thus to trace matters up to their original, and to &s;et principles and facts in as clear light
<PB N="72" REF="012655_0071_0F8BBF3D93D7F0D8">as might be, not only to vindicate our &s;entiments and characters, again&s;t our learned opponents, but al&s;o to detect the fal&s;e pretences of &s;ome, who are ready to &s;eparate from their brethren upon every turn of affairs, yet pretending to &s;tand and act in the &s;ame cau&s;e we fir&s;t came out upon. And this is no new thing; for even in the apo&s;tles days, after they had earne&s;tly appeared for truth and go&s;pel liberty, and for deliverance from Jewi&s;h and heathen bondage, &s;ome took occa&s;ion under the name of <HI>liberty</HI> to <HI>di&s;pi&s;e go|vernment;</HI> who notwith&s;tanding their great <HI>&s;wel|ling words,</HI> were really <HI>&s;ervants of corruption.</HI> 2 Pet. 2.10&mdash;19. And it will ever be found, that licentiou&s;ne&s;s is as real an enemy to liberty, as tyranny; nor is their any great difference between them.</P>
<P>Government is for every one to act toward others, in their &s;everal &s;tations and relations, by known laws and e&s;tabli&s;hed rules; tyranny and licentiou&s;ne&s;s are the following our own inclina|tions without due regard to &s;uch rules. But as &s;uch a way of acting mu&s;t look odious to all rati|onal minds, when it appears in its own colours; therefore men have always tried to cover it with &s;ome &s;pecious pretence or another, which yet may be detected by &s;uch marks as the&s;e. 1. Where &s;elf prevails, it will try to excite in others &s;o high an opinion of our deep in&s;ight into things that they do not under&s;tand, as to yield implicitly to us; while a humble teacher abhors &s;uch a dominion over others faith, and labours to ma|nife&s;t the truth to every man's con&s;cience, and exhorts all &s;aints to walk in Chri&s;t <HI>as they have been taught.</HI> 2 Cor. 1.24. and 4.2. Col. 2.7.&mdash;
<PB N="73" REF="012655_0072_0F8BBF3EA664DF68">18.2. Whatever garb pride is covered with, if it is cro&s;&s;ed it will di&s;cover bitterne&s;s, and often moves its &s;ubjects to become fal&s;e accu&s;ers, and fierce de&s;pi&s;ers of tho&s;e who are good. Micah 3.5. 2 Tim. 3.3, 5. While the humble &s;oul is patient, and in meekne&s;s labours to in&s;truct tho&s;e who oppo&s;e them&s;elves. 2 Tim. 2.24, 25. Jam. 3.1, 13&mdash;18. It appears by Jotham's parable, that worthy minds, like the olive, fig-tree and vine, prefer u&s;efulne&s;s and the yielding of &s;weet fruit to others, to any promotion and power over them; while worthle&s;s creatures, like the bram|ble, are forward for dominion; and if any refu&s;e to &s;ubmit to them, they are pre&s;ently for fire to come out and devour the be&s;t charac|ters that will dare to oppo&s;e their ambition. Judges 9.7&mdash;15. Hence 3. True love unites tenderne&s;s with faithfulne&s;s, labouring to gain mens per&s;ons, while it u&s;es boldne&s;s again&s;t their &s;ins; but a proud temper wants to get rid of all who refu&s;e to gratify it, and is ready to &s;ay, <HI>Am I my brother's keeper!</HI> Gen. 4. 1 John 3.12.</P>
<P>As I am willing to have all I have &s;aid and done in the&s;e affairs, tried by the&s;e marks, and no further regarded than it agrees there|with; &s;o I earne&s;tly intreat all my friends and brethren, carefully to examine their conduct thereby. If we do not de&s;pi&s;e government, we have a con&s;cientious regard to Chri&s;t's authority, and to act in our &s;everal &s;tation and relations as he has commanded us. He has commanded us to <HI>hold fa&s;t our profe&s;&s;ion,</HI> and to con&s;ider one a|nother to provoke unto love and good works; not for&s;aking the a&s;&s;embling our&s;elves together, &amp;c. Heb. 10.23&mdash;25. But do not &s;ome let go
<PB N="74" REF="012655_0073_0F8BBF3ED458F430">their profe&s;&s;ion, in&s;tead of holding it fa&s;t; and for&s;ake their brethren becau&s;e they &s;ay they are fallen, in&s;tead of con&s;idering their weak and tempted &s;tate, and labouring to &s;tir them up, or to re&s;tore them in a &s;pirit of meekne&s;s, as the command is! Gal. 6.1. The &s;ame authority &s;ays, Take heed to your&s;elves, if thy brother tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t thee, rebuke him; and if he re|pent forgive him: and &s;ays, All things that are reproved are made manife&s;t by the light. Luke 17.3. Eph. 5.13. But do not &s;ome accu&s;e their brethren, of having fallen out of the te&s;timony, of not coming up into the witne&s;s; of &s;ome &s;uch <HI>general</HI> phra&s;es, without and <HI>light</HI> to <HI>manife&s;t,</HI> wherein they have advanced any <HI>parti|cular</HI> error, or broken any particular precept? Yea, do not &s;ome hover in general or figurative words, and tell their brethren, that they cannot &s;ee where they are, unle&s;s they come up into the witne&s;s, &amp;c.? which is a practi&s;ing the very &s;ame iniquity under the pretence of &s;piritual teaching, as others have done under the name of great learning. Whereas our Lord &s;aid to his apo&s;tles, A candle gives light to all that are in the hou&s;e; <HI>let your light &s;hine before men, that they may &s;ee,</HI> &amp;c. Such per&s;ons are very ready to condemn the learned for keeping their people in ignorance; though &s;ome of them are as gro&s;sly guilty of <HI>darkening coun&s;el</HI> with <HI>words without knowledge,</HI> as any &s;ophi&s;ter of the age.</P>
<P>True pa&s;tors feed God's people with know|ledge and under&s;tanding, not with unintelligible noi&s;e. We have a glorious promi&s;e, that when &s;corners are con&s;umed, who have made &s;uch u&s;e of <HI>words</HI> as to turn a&s;ide the ju&s;t for a thing of
<PB N="75" REF="012655_0074_0F8BBF3F85086038">nought, that then, <HI>They</HI> that erred in &s;pirit &s;hall come to <HI>under&s;tanding,</HI> and they that murmured &s;hall <HI>learn doctrine.</HI> I&s;a. 29.20&mdash;24. And it af|fords great comfort and encouragement to my &s;oul, to &s;ee how much this promi&s;e is now fulfil|ling in our land; notwith&s;tanding &s;ome are &s;till afraid freely to exerci&s;e their under&s;tandings for fear of getting legal; and &s;eem to think that to <HI>learn doctrine,</HI> and the di&s;tinct nature and connection of things, would lead them off from &s;pirituality: whereas we have no more of &s;pirituality than we have of likene&s;s to God, in whom is <HI>no darkne&s;s at all;</HI> and the very rea&s;on why it is impo&s;&s;ible for God to lie, or to be tempted of evil, is becau&s;e he <HI>knows better.</HI> I John 1.5. James 1.13&mdash;17.</P>
<P>One important que&s;tion is yet before us, which is; How &s;hall we know when we have ju&s;t cau&s;e to &s;eparate and when not? The rule is perfect, but the be&s;t of men, or of churches, are imper|fect; and &s;ome will join with no church, becau&s;e they can't find a perfect one; while others &s;eem as if they would &s;wallow any thing, if it did not cro&s;s their own inclination. The rule requires conde&s;cention and forbearance, but how &s;hall we know its true limits and extent? I confe&s;s that this has been as difficult a point heretofore in my mind, as any point in practical godline&s;s. The cleare&s;t light that I have obtained in it is this. It is e&s;&s;ential to acting rationally that we have &s;ome de&s;ign or end in what we do. Now the leading de&s;ign of the go&s;pel, is to turn men from &s;in to God. Act. 26.18. And &s;o far as conforming to circumci&s;ion, and other Jewi&s;h rites, would pro|mote this end, Paul conde&s;cended to the Jews, (and &s;o to others) but when tho&s;e things were
<PB N="76" REF="012655_0075_0F8BBF405267CAC0">brought up in &s;uch a way as to cro&s;s that de&s;ign, he would not give place an hour longer, but ap|peared again&s;t them with a fixed re&s;olution. Gal. 2.5. and 5.2.</P>
<P>Another great de&s;ign, is the edification of the &s;aints; and we are all required to follow the things which make for that end. Rom. 14, 19. And every member of Chri&s;t, is required to im|prove the gift that he has given for that end; and liberty &s;o to do, is of importance to be main|tained. Yet while this liberty has not been al|lowed, (as we have &s;een) in the churches we came out of, &s;ome have ran to the other extreme, and have been &s;o zealous for the liberty of &s;peaking, as not duly to regard others liberty of judging; and in&s;tead of being <HI>&s;ubject</HI> one to another, and <HI>cloath|ed with humility,</HI> have &s;adly di&s;covered a contrary behaviour. 2 Cor 14.1 Pet. 5.5. Once more; the wi&s;dom that is from above, is <HI>fir&s;t pure,</HI> then <HI>peaceable;</HI> and &s;o far as peace can be had con&s;i&s;|tent with purity; it is to be pur&s;ued with all men: but we are never to &s;ell the truth for peace, no not to &s;ave natural life. Jam. 3.17. Heb. 12.14. Prov. 23.23.</P>
<P>Now if our eye be &s;ingle in any of the&s;e affairs to the end for which God has appointed them, he will &s;urely guide us in judgment in our u&s;e of the means; for Chri&s;t's word is, If thine eye be &s;in|gle thy whole body &s;hall be full of light: but if evil, how great will be our darkne&s;s? Mat. 6.23. And it is very nece&s;&s;ary that we well di&s;|tingui&s;h, between what are the divine commands, and the forbearance that is allowed in &s;ome ca&s;es towards per&s;ons who do not fully conform to them. For want of this di&s;tinction, &s;o great a
<PB N="77" REF="012655_0076_0F8BBF411419FF00">man as Mr. Bunyan, improved the in&s;tance of forbearance in 2 Chron. 30.18&mdash;20, to e&s;tabli&s;h the cu&s;tom of communing at the Lord's table with unbaptized per&s;ons. Whereas the per&s;ons who then partook of the pa&s;&s;over <HI>otherwi&s;e than it was written,</HI> had not enjoyed the free u&s;e of tho&s;e writings for a long time; and we have no account of their ever partaking &s;o again. What a great mi&s;take then was it, to bring an extraor|dinary ca&s;e, to e&s;tabli&s;h a general rule? Yet &s;ome have gone further &s;till; for they have im|proved in&s;tances of forbearance as an argument again&s;t the authority of expre&s;s commands.</P>
<P>How have many improved in&s;tances of God's vi&s;iting, and u&s;ing further means with degenerate churches before he ca&s;t them off; as an argument that we ought to continue with them, even after it is evident to us that they refu&s;e to be reform|ed? Again, Paul's foregoing his right of tem|poral communications from &s;ome of his hearers, for particular rea&s;ons that he gives, 1 Cor. 9. &s;ome have improved as an argument that hearers are under no obligation to communicate to any on account of their teaching, but only on account of poverty; and if they are not poor, then not at all. Tho' there is not a plainer command in the bible, for mini&s;ters to preach the go&s;pel, than there is, for <HI>him that is taught in the word,</HI> to <HI>communicate unto him that teacheth in</HI> ALL <HI>good things.</HI>" Gal. 6.6. I tru&s;t it has been &s;ufficiently proved, that the authority of King George does not extend to this ca&s;e; but &s;hall that make us to di&s;regard the authority of King Je&s;us! If he be duly re|garded, I believe it will be found that both mi|ni&s;ters and people, are but <HI>&s;tewards</HI> of what they
<PB N="78" REF="012655_0077_0F8BBF41CF11D190">po&s;&s;e&s; and therefore that avoiding all unrea|&s;onable cen&s;uring of each other, their great con|cern &s;hould be, that in their &s;everal &s;tations and relations they may be found <HI>faithful,</HI> &s;o as at la&s;t to receive <HI>prai&s;e of God.</HI> 1 Cor. 4.1&mdash;5.</P>

<HEAD>AN ADDRESS TO Mr. <HI>Jo&s;eph Fi&s;h.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE you accu&s;e me with, <Q>&s;etting up my|&s;elf as <HI>Cen&s;or general</HI> of the pre&s;ent genera|tion, and with &s;ending abroad a book, full of invectives, bitterne&s;s, clamour and evil-&s;peaking again&s;t Chri&s;t's mini&s;ters.</Q> p. 124, 126. I know of no better method to an&s;wer it, than by a little imitation of the apo&s;tles example in like ca&s;es. Acts. 11.4&mdash;17. and 21.1&mdash;21. Namely to give a plain narrative of what I have done, and the rea&s;ons of my doing &s;o.</P>
<P>As to &s;etting up my&s;elf, I freely appeal to all that knew me, that from my cradle to my en|trance on preaching, I di&s;covered a di&s;po&s;ition, the rever&s;e of &s;etting up my&s;elf, as head or leader of any company what&s;oever. And my con&s;ci|ence bears me witne&s;s in the &s;ight of God, that
<PB N="80" REF="012655_0079_0F8BBF43A72020E8">the only rea&s;on of my engaging in that work, was becau&s;e I was &s;o clearly convinced, that He had given me a <HI>gift,</HI> which He called me to improve in that way, that I dur&s;t not neglect obedience to Him therein; for I believed then, and do to this day, that there was a <HI>wo unto me if I preached not the go&s;pel:</HI> therefore I heartily devoted my&s;elf to that work, and was freely received therein by God's people; in which I went on for a number of years, before I had any thoughts of appearing to the world in print. But being called to preach in various places, that old que&s;tion was often put, by tho&s;e called &s;tanding mini&s;ters, <HI>by what autho|rity do&s;t thou the&s;e things?</HI> and the darkne&s;s which they di&s;covered about it, at la&s;t moved me to attempt to hold up to the world, the light that was given me therein, which was accordingly done in 1754, under the title of, <Q>The nature and nece&s;&s;ity of an internal call to preach the go&s;pel.</Q> And your learned brethren were &s;o far from attempting ro confute it, that &s;ome of them expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch charity as this; that <Q><HI>I. B.</HI> never wrote that book, but got his name &s;et to the works of &s;ome other man; for (&s;aid they) &s;carce one to ten of our college-learnt men could write &s;uch a di&s;cour&s;e.</Q> Whereas it is known to Him who will judge us all, that no per&s;on on earth, either wrote or indited one line of it, but he who&s;e name &s;tands in the title page.</P>
<P>As to bapti&s;m, after long and &s;ore exerci&s;es of mind, occa&s;ioned as I &s;ee now, chiefly by the fal&s;e repre&s;entations which tradition had handed down to us, both concerning principles and facts, I was at la&s;t favored with a comfortable e&s;tabli&s;h|ment. After which I was publicly declared, to
<PB N="81" REF="012655_0080_0F8BBF443459DEE8">be a <HI>covenant-breaker,</HI> for turning from infant bapti&s;m, notwith&s;tanding our covenant, like that of the fathers of this country, expre&s;&s;ed an en|gagement, to embrace further light as God &s;hould open it to us. When this cen&s;ure came abroad, in the re&s;ult of a council of elders and brethren, who had profe&s;&s;ed and acted in fellow&s;hip with bapti&s;t churches, it naturally cau&s;ed a general difficulty; and which at length occa&s;ioned a ge|neral meeting of the &s;eparate and bapti&s;t churches in your town, in May, 1754; where I remember &s;ir, that you was among the &s;pectators; when, in&s;tead of attending to the point in hand, which was, whether a declaring, that turning from in|fant bapti&s;m was covenant breaking, did not give ju&s;t occa&s;ion of offence to the bapti&s;ts? I &s;ay in&s;tead of that, much time was taken up in expo&s;ing my imperfections about the&s;e affairs; which had the &s;ame effect with many, that &s;uch-like treatment of the bapti&s;ts has often had, ever &s;ince the fir&s;t reformations from popery; viz. to prevent their &s;eeing things in their true light. But tho' my character was thus injuriou&s;ly treated, &s;e|venty miles from home, before an a&s;&s;embly, from at lea&s;t three of the four governments of New-England, yet I cho&s;e as much as po&s;&s;ible, to avoid all per&s;onal conte&s;ts, and only publi&s;hed, as clearly as I was enabled, the true &s;tate of the argument concerning bapti&s;m, in a di&s;cour&s;e up|on the <HI>bond-woman</HI> and the <HI>free.</HI></P>
<P>And I never engaged in a printed controver&s;y with any particular per&s;on, for &s;eventeen years after my call to the public mini&s;try; till in 1764, the gentleman under who&s;e mini&s;try I was born, and from whom I &s;eparated, with &s;ix others, pub|li&s;hed
<PB N="82" REF="012655_0081_0F8BBF48A4CC9010">a piece, wherein, after mentioning the order to blow the <HI>trumpet,</HI> and to &s;ound an <HI>alarm</HI> in Zion, they went on to alarm the world, with a repre&s;entation that the <HI>late &s;eparates</HI> and <HI>bapti&s;ts,</HI> were <HI>going fa&s;t</HI> into a <HI>dreadful apo&s;tacy;</HI> and that it was, <Q>hid from them, or rather, that they <HI>will not &s;ee,</HI> that they have fell into the way of <HI>Cain,</HI> and are in danger of <HI>peri&s;hing</HI> in the <HI>gain|&s;aying</HI> of <HI>Core.</HI></Q> Upon a &s;ight of this, and other things of like nature, from my old mini&s;ter, I &s;ent a printed <HI>letter</HI> to him, upon the inju&s;tice of &s;uch conduct. And what is there in all this, of &s;etting up my&s;elf? Tho' I know I am a very imperfect creature, yet I can freely &s;ubmit, both the occa&s;ion, and the temper of the&s;e writings, to the judgment of every chri&s;tian reader.</P>
<P>When you &s;ir, three years after, publi&s;hed a large piece, in the &s;ame &s;train with the mini&s;ters ju&s;t mentioned, and I was prevail'd with to exa|mine it, I thought &s;omething further was called for, than what I had before done.

This you cannot deny, but try to evade it by &s;aying, you was not treating of a <HI>particular</HI> church; and then you &s;lip in a clau&s;e, that in ca&s;e of <HI>exce&s;&s;ive fear,</HI> our fathers varied from their common method. p. 51. And who ever denied that?</P>
<P>This led me down to open a third article of difference between you and our fathers, which is the root of all, namely the <HI>matter</HI> of the go&s;pel church. And I produce full te&s;timonies from &s;uch as you allow to be &s;ome of your mo&s;t emi|nent fathers. <Q>That if it &s;hould pa&s;s for cur|rent doctrine in New-England, that all per|&s;ons <HI>orthodox</HI> in judgment, as to matters of faith, not <HI>&s;candalous</HI> in life, ought to be admit|ted to partake of the Lord's &s;upper, without an examination concerning the <HI>work of &s;aving grace in their hearts,</HI> it would be a real <HI>apo&s;|tacy</HI> from former principles.</Q> Then I pro|duced the <HI>letter</HI> publi&s;hed again&s;t us by &s;ixteen mini&s;ters (and you now call it an excellent <HI>letter.</HI> p. 54.) which &s;ays, <Q>It is the will of Chri&s;t, that all tho&s;e who make an <HI>outward credible profe&s;&s;ion of chri&s;tianity,</HI> &s;hould be admitted in|to his church, and though <HI>unconverted</HI> BE THERE.</Q> Ex. p. 18.20.</P>
<P>Thus I proved, that our fathers held the power of ordination to be in the church; but that you hold it to be in mini&s;ters. That they held to admitting members by verbal relations; you to written ones, or none at all: And thirdly that our fathers declared, That a <HI>general profe&s;&s;ion</HI> would be real <HI>apo&s;tacy;</HI> and I proved that your chur|ches have got into it: yet you &s;huffle along, till from our fathers writing, you bring out the
<PB N="95" REF="012655_0094_0F8BBF59D0FB55F8">materials of the church to be <HI>profe&s;&s;ing believers,</HI> and <HI>their children,</HI> and then &s;ay, <Q>Surely here is <HI>di&s;tinction</HI> without difference&mdash;And yet he is &s;hewing an <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> difference between the &s;tanding churches, and the fir&s;t in the land. ALL the difference is they EXACTLY agree.</Q> p. 52.</P>
<P>Whether this is mo&s;t properly called <HI>&s;ophi&s;try,</HI> or <HI>lying,</HI> I leave with God and your own con&s;cience, praying that you may be brought to true repen|tance.</P>
<P>Having as I concieved, fully proved and e&s;&s;en|tial difference between your churches and our fathers, and meeting with that glaring perver&s;ion of the parable of the tares, viz. applying what Chri&s;t &s;poke of the <HI>world,</HI> to the <HI>church;</HI> I took occa&s;ion to point out the nature of his order, <HI>Let both grow together;</HI> and how it has been violated among us, by depriving tho&s;e of their <HI>worldly</HI> liberties and enjoyments, who would not conform to the pari&s;h mini&s;ters. Upon which I gave it as my mind that there may and ought to be, a <HI>&s;weet harmony</HI> between civil and eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal rulers, but not <HI>&s;uch a union</HI> as had been a|mong us; for which I gave my rea&s;ons, and en|devoured di&s;tinctly to run the line between them, Ex. p. 20&mdash;32. yet you a&s;&s;ert this part of my book to be <Q>mixed, inconnected and without order,</Q> and that I have got <HI>be&s;ide</HI> my <HI>profe&s;&s;ed</HI> de&s;ign, and al&s;o that I fault your churches for <HI>a connection</HI> with the &s;tate, which you &s;ay, <Q>is evi|dently warranted by the holy &s;criptures.</Q> p. 55. 56. But take notice; the fir&s;t part of my profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign was, to <HI>open the con&s;titution</HI> of your churches. Ex. p. 15. and in this place I
<PB N="96" REF="012655_0095_0F8BBF5A9130A280">was not be&s;ide it, but upon it, and proved the <HI>con&s;titution</HI> to be &s;uch, that if the pari&s;h mini&s;ter di&s;liked another's preaching near him, or called for his &s;alary, the &s;ecular powers mu&s;t exert their <HI>force</HI> to remove tho&s;e he was offended with; and to an&s;wer his demands: And if you Sir, thought <HI>&s;uch a connection</HI> to be warranted by &s;crip|ture, your bu&s;ine&s;s evidently was to bring your proofs. And have you done it? No.&mdash;Indeed you have proved that there was <HI>a union</HI> between the church and &s;tate in I&s;rael, (which I held as much as you) but not a word of <HI>&s;uch a connection</HI> as I had faulted. p. 56. 57. Then you &s;hew that I&s;a. 49.23, and 1 Tim. 2.1, 2. imply <Q>Not only that the magi&s;trate &s;hould not him&s;elf lay hands on us, nor &s;end his officers and &s;ervants to &s;poil us of, or interrupt us <HI>in,</HI> the enjoyment of our religious rights; but al&s;o that as he has it in his power, he would re&s;train and puni&s;h tho&s;e that &s;hould mole&s;t or trouble us in mat|ters of <HI>godline&s;s</HI> or <HI>religion,</HI> as well as in matters of <HI>hone&s;ty,</HI> which we have a right to, in com|mon with other men.</Q> p. 58.</P>
<P>And where is &s;ophi&s;try now! dare you Mr. <HI>Fi&s;h,</HI> before him who&s;e eyes are like a flame of fire, pretend that I have wrote a word, or formed the lea&s;t argument again&s;t <HI>&s;uch</HI> an exerci&s;e of the magi&s;trates power towards the church as you have de&s;cribed! No: if tho&s;e powers had not been moved by <HI>your</HI> brethren in the <HI>mini&s;try</HI> to act the very contrary part, to what you have proved from the word of God that they ought to have acted, I a&s;&s;ure you I would not have troubled you in this affair.

<P>Now Sir, come up like an hone&s;t man. The&s;e rules were fir&s;t drawn by mini&s;ters, and thou art the mini&s;ter who ha&s;t blamed me for not being <HI>contented</HI> with them, declaring them to be laid down with <HI>caution</HI> and <HI>excellency of &s;pirit;</HI> and I can freely appeal to your con&s;cience, that it
<PB N="98" REF="012655_0097_0F8BBF5C0D07E830">was really according to the <HI>&s;pirit</HI> of the&s;e rules that the magi&s;trate acted, when to prevent our fir&s;t &s;eparate ordination at Mansfield, they &s;ent their &s;ervants, when the old gentlemen that was elected for their pa&s;tor, was at wor&s;hip with his church the day before he was to have been or|dained, and LAID HANDS on him, and carried him to pri&s;on, for preaching without the li|cence of &s;uch <HI>mini&s;ters</HI> as thou art.

Ex. p. 47.</P>
<P>So openly were tho&s;e doings of the civil powers (which you have proved was the rever&s;e of what they ought to have acted) countenanced by mi|ni&s;ters, who were mo&s;t if not all of them, &s;igners of that which you now call an <HI>excellent letter;</HI> and &s;o openly did they &s;ay in practice, that if the&s;e people would withdraw from their <HI>churches,</HI> they &s;hould not peaceably <HI>grow together with them in the world.</HI> Yet Mr. <HI>F.</HI> thou art the man, who ha&s;t declared to the world, that <Q>It is wholly out of rule, and quite injurious, for Mr. <HI>B.</HI> to charge the <HI>churches</HI> or their <HI>mini&s;ters</HI> with &s;ending men to jail for rates, or other <HI>like pro|&s;ecutions</HI> (as he rudely talks, and unrea&s;onably complains, throughout his book) for <HI>the&s;e</HI> pro|ceedings are evidently the acts of the civil &s;tate, done for its OWN utility.</Q> p. 56. <Q>The doings of the civil authority, and of that ALONE.</Q> p. 59.</P>

<P>Here Mr. <HI>F.</HI> permit me to tell you one thing, and that is; as much as you think I am prejudi|ced again&s;t your order of mini&s;ters, yet I would not have ventured to believe, much le&s;s pub|lickly to declare, that you knowingly held to &s;o gro&s;s things as you now expre&s;s, both concern|ing a learned tongue, and the golden rule, not upon the verbal te&s;timony of the be&s;t friend I have on earth. No, I &s;hould have thought they &s;ome way mi&s;took your meaning: but what is written is written.

Three years after our fathers publi&s;hed tho&s;e rules in the Cambridge platform, which you &s;ay 'tis pity I had not been contented with, Mr. John Clark, pa&s;tor of the bapti&s;t church in Newport (and who was learned both in Greek and Hebrew) went with two of his friends to vi&s;it &s;ome breth|ren in Lynn; but as they were peaceably wor|&s;hipping God together, on Lord's day, July 20, 1651, a magi&s;trate was &s;o zealous to follow the mini&s;ters rules, that he put forth his <HI>coercive power,</HI> and had tho&s;e three men &s;eized before they had fini&s;hed their forenoon exerci&s;e, and car|ried in the afternoon to the pari&s;h wor&s;hip; and afterwards &s;ent them pri&s;oners to Bo&s;ton.

<PB N="106" REF="012655_0105_0F8BBE9AAB55C7D0">forms of divine &s;ervice; which renders it difficult, if not <HI>impracticable</HI> for them to wor&s;hip harmo|niou&s;ly together. And how do you know but that this is the very ca&s;e with your di&s;&s;enting brethren? Will you have the face to pretend to know that their <HI>hearts</HI> were not <HI>equally hone&s;t</HI> with your's! If not, then what a violation of rule have you been guilty of, in trying to &s;trip them of all their <HI>virtues,</HI> and to draw their <HI>characters</HI> to the world only from their <HI>imperfections!</HI> Yet you &s;ay, <Q>I acted agreeable to the <HI>golden rule,</HI> in telling them <HI>of,</HI> and reproving them <HI>for</HI> their <HI>imperfections</HI> and errors: for &s;urely, that rule don't oblige us to tell a brother all his <HI>good properties,</HI> when we go to reprove him for his faults.</Q> p. 19. Perhaps if you again look over our Lord's treatment of the &s;even churches of A&s;ia, you will find your <HI>&s;urely,</HI> to be a mi&s;take as to the manner of reproving; but Sir, that was not the work that you was about, by your own account the principal de&s;ign of your &s;er|mons, was to draw the &s;eparates <HI>character before others</HI> in&s;tead of reproving <HI>them:</HI> and a principal article of advice and exhortation in your con|clu&s;ion, given out to the world is, <Q>Go not af|ter THEM nor follow THEM.&mdash;<HI>keep your di&s;|tance</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In your &s;ermons p. 164, you applied I&s;a. 65.5. to 28; but who is it now that &s;ays, <HI>&s;tand by thy &s;elf, come not near ME!</HI></NOTE> from THEM. Beware that you neither <HI>interrupt</HI> their devotion, nor <HI>join</HI> with THEM in their wor&s;hip.

<P>Should you Sir, try again to evade conviction by pretending that I have forgot my &s;ubject, and in&s;tead of opening the <HI>difference,</HI> have &s;hewn an <HI>exact likene&s;s,</HI> between you and our fathers. I reply that this is a great mi&s;take; and to intro|duce a &s;hort view of the difference, I would refer you to Ezek. 43.7, 9. And whatever may be the primary meaning of the text, I believe there is no inju&s;tice in accommodating it to the ca&s;e in hand. A hou&s;e filled with the <HI>carca&s;es</HI> of fathers and rulers, cannot prove that it is <HI>the &s;piritual hou&s;e</HI> which they built with <HI>lively &s;tones.</HI> And to examine whether &s;omething of this nature does not appear in New-England, let the following points be con&s;idered.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Dr. Owen, who for &s;ome time was expect|ed, and always was much e&s;teemed here, evident|ly expre&s;&s;ed the &s;entiments of our mo&s;t eminent fathers, as to the <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ion</HI> of mini&s;ters, when he ob&s;erved, that it is <HI>&s;ufficiently</HI> &s;ecured, by our Lord's erecting that office, and giving warrant for it's continuance to the end; and by his continu|ance according to his promi&s;e, to communicate <HI>&s;pi|ritual gifts</HI> unto men for the edification of his church; who&s;e duty it is to chu&s;e, call and &s;olemnly <HI>&s;et a part</HI> unto the office of the mini&s;try &s;uch as Chri&s;t <HI>by his &s;pirit</HI> has made meet for it, according to the rule of his word; and then he &s;ays, <Q>Tho&s;e who plead for the continuation of a <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ive mini&s;try,</HI> without re&s;pect unto <HI>the&s;e things,</HI> without re&s;olving both the <HI>authority</HI> and <HI>office</HI> of it <HI>un|to them,</HI> do but erect a <HI>dead image</HI> or imbrace a <HI>dead</HI> CARCASE, in&s;tead of the <HI>living</HI> and <HI>life-giving</HI>

<ITEM>2. Our fathers had &s;uch a <HI>&s;pirit of faith</HI> in preaching,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 4.13.</NOTE> that the &s;ame Mr. Cotton whom we were but now treating of, declared, that the <HI>difference</HI> will ever hold between the word <HI>read</HI> and <HI>preached,</HI> they are <HI>two di&s;tinct</HI> ordinances. Herein we hold with him; but you do not. Ex. p. 72.73.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. In the effect of &s;uch preach|ing, which brought per&s;ons before all the a&s;&s;em|bly to declare the <HI>workings of God's &s;pirit in their hearts,</HI> we hold with our fathers, while many of your churches have not even the <HI>carca&s;e</HI> of that cu&s;tom left. Ex. p. 54, 55.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Tho' our fathers held to the u&s;e of compul&s;ion in religion, yet they did not entru&s;t &s;uch a power with any but <HI>brethren</HI> in their churches; but you Sir, put this compelling power into the hands of many who are not mem|bers of any church at all.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. As I have already &s;hewn, they allowed none to <HI>vote</HI> for rulers or mi|ni&s;ters but members in full communion, and your beloved Mitchel declared, that it would <HI>ruin</HI> the churches if <HI>election of mini&s;ters</HI> were carried by a <HI>loo&s;er &s;ort</HI> of members, Ex. p. 51. How then are they now <HI>ruined,</HI> when you are forced to own that <HI>worldly</HI> e&s;tate makes voters in &s;uch affairs! p. 83.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. Though the fir&s;t fathers of New-Eng|land held to infant-bapti&s;m, yet they were &s;o far from holding of it upon the footing you do, that though &s;ome tried hard to bring it on to that footing when Cambridge platform was compo&s;ed, yet they were prevented the doing of it, as Dr.
<PB N="109" REF="012655_0108_0F8BBE9CC682D6F0">Mather tells us, by <HI>many worthy men.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mitchel's life p. 73.</NOTE> And &s;uch worthy men as Hooker, Cotton, Shepard, and others, were gone to eternity, and Mr. Nor|ton was in England; when they introduced the &s;cheme in 1662, which you embrace: and the aged pre&s;ident Chauncy, and Mr. Devenport, who were pre&s;ent, could not be ea&s;y with bear|ing only a verbal, but they and others al&s;o bore a printed te&s;timony again&s;t it.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Therefore it was contrary to truth for you to a&s;&s;ert an <HI>exact agreement</HI> with them, even in the point of infant bap|ti&s;m. p. 60.</NOTE></ITEM>
<ITEM>8. While our fathers were &s;o much blinded as to think force was to be u&s;ed in religion, they were in earne&s;t to force men to <HI>conform</HI> to what they e&s;teemed the right way, as well as to &s;upport it: but how little pains is now taken with men's per&s;ons, if they can but get their money!</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>In &s;hort, the greate&s;t likene&s;s that I can &s;ee be|tween many of the pre&s;ent generation, and tho&s;e fa|thers is in a <HI>tenderne&s;s</HI> for <HI>&s;elf,</HI> and a want of ten|derne&s;s for its oppo&s;ites. Mr. Cotton could readily &s;ind a divine example, where &s;elf was affected, for not proceeding upon <HI>report,</HI> without a full examination whether they were <HI>altogether</HI> true or not; and al&s;o for not wrapping up the guilty and innocent together: yet how contrary there|to is his treatment of the bapti&s;ts in the &s;ame letter? And you &s;ir, complain much of me for publi&s;hing many things concerning your de|nomination, which you do not di&s;pute the truth of (though I gave you a fair opportunity to do it, by naming per&s;ons and places, giving dates and quoting my vouchers) while you have treated
<PB N="110" REF="012655_0109_0F8BBE9D8ABFD0D8">us quite otherwi&s;e; and how have you now raked the &s;treets of Canterbury for &s;omething again&s;t that church, and then you in&s;inuate that we are not <HI>hone&s;t</HI> to own our principles, nor <HI>humble</HI> e|nough to confe&s;s and put away our <HI>errors,</HI> becau&s;e we do not own all that you are plea&s;ed to accu&s;e us with! p. 113. As to the principle you there refer to, I did confe&s;s the truth concerning it, Ex. p. 50, and you mu&s;t an&s;wer it to our great judge, for your in&s;inuating the contrary here again&s;t me.</P>
<P>I am now prepared to an&s;wer your query, whether I had not forgotten my &s;ect, when I expre&s;&s;ed my concern for the fall of New-England from her ancient di&s;cipline? Ex. p. 92. And you &s;ay, <Q>Why did not his heart &s;mite him, and his pen blot out that expre&s;&s;ion, of his deep concern for New-England, as fallen from its ancient purity and glory, becau&s;e her mini|&s;ters to now te&s;tify again&s;t the corruptions of <HI>&s;eparation</HI> and <HI>anabapti&s;m,</HI> ju&s;t as the fathers in the fir&s;t churches did?</Q> p. 111.</P>
<P>An&s;wer 1. The forgoing account plainly &s;hews that they were &s;o much blinded by <HI>&s;elf,</HI> as to try to ju&s;tify &s;uch treatment of di&s;&s;enters from <HI>them,</HI> as one of their chief magi&s;trates calls <HI>Tyranny, per&s;ecution</HI> and <HI>rigid ways;</HI> and as learned &s;aints on the other &s;ide of the water, veiwed to be &s;o, even in their mo&s;t &s;olemn exerci&s;es. Yea the learned Mr. Neal (whom none, that have read his hi&s;tory of the <HI>puritans</HI> can &s;u&s;pect of being prejudiced in favour of the bapti&s;ts) he does not &s;cruple to declare, that in dealing with Mr. Clark and his brethren, they <Q>Broke in upon the <HI>natural rights</HI> of mankind, puni&s;hing men,

<P N="2">2. While they accu&s;ed the bapti&s;ts of <HI>wil|fulne&s;s,</HI> they mo&s;t evidently di&s;covered a great <HI>bias</HI> and <HI>prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion</HI> again&s;t them in their own minds. I noted before that Mr. Hooker, and from him Mr. Mitchel, <HI>re&s;oved</HI> to have an ar|gument able to <HI>remove a mountain,</HI> before they would recede from infant bapti&s;m. Ex. p. 98. And Mr. Cotton, in a piece he wrote on that &s;ubject, again&s;t &s;uch as he owns did not, <Q>deny magi&s;trates, nor prede&s;tination, nor original &s;in; nor maintain free-will in conver&s;ion, nor apo&s;tacy from grace: but only denied the lawful u&s;e of the bapti&s;m of children, becau&s;e it wanteth a word both of commandment and example from the &s;cripture.</Q> Yea that he was bound to believe that they did this <Q>out of
<PB N="112" REF="012655_0111_0F8BBE9F07047E58">con&s;cience, as following the example of the apo&s;tle:</Q> yet he goes on to declare, that he al&s;o believed, that <HI>&s;atan</HI> had <HI>yielded</HI> &s;o far in the&s;e &s;tirring times of reformation, as to plead no other argument than what may be urged from that main principle of reformation, <Q>That no duty of God's wor&s;hip, nor ordinance of religion is to be admini&s;tered in the church, but &s;uch as hath ju&s;t warrant from the word of God.</Q> And (&s;ays he) by urging this argument again&s;t the <Q>bapti&s;m of children, &s;atan transformeth him|felf into an angel of light.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Cotton or the <HI>grounds and ends of the bapti&s;m of children.</HI> Printed 1647. p. 3, 4,</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>About the &s;ame time a mini&s;ter at Lynn, wrote again&s;t a number of bapti&s;t authors; but before he came to any of their arguments, he compares the admitting any <HI>&s;cruple</HI> about infant bapti&s;m, to mother Eve's <HI>admitting</HI> the &s;erpent's que&s;tion, <HI>Hath God &s;aid it?</HI> and &s;ays, <Q>Let my advice be grateful to thee thus far, chri&s;tian reader, to take heed of unnece&s;&s;ary di&s;cour&s;es and di&s;putes with <HI>&s;atanical &s;ugge&s;tions.</HI>&mdash;It is not the fir&s;t age and time that &s;atanical &s;ug|ge&s;tions, <HI>Thus it is written,</HI> and <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord,</HI> hath been propounded.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. Thomas Cobbet's <HI>vindication of the covenant, and church e&s;tate of children.</HI> Printed 1648.

<P>Thus people were taught, to guard again&s;t the plaine&s;t &s;criptures that could be brought a|gain&s;t infant bapti&s;m as being from &s;atan; and Mr. Cobbet, near the clo&s;e of his book<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 295.</NOTE> calls it a <HI>a profane trick,</HI> for any to turn their backs
<PB N="113" REF="012655_0112_0F8BBEA01ADF3620">when an infant was going to be &s;prinkled, and <HI>bla&s;phemy</HI> to &s;tile that practice antichri&s;tian.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was doubtle&s;s in con&s;equence of &s;uch teaching as this that the following law was made in Bo&s;ton, 1644, viz.

<P>But alas! how dreadfully had &s;atan <HI>yielded</HI> when he had <HI>prevailed</HI> with tho&s;e fathers, to take his weapons of <HI>&s;lander</HI> and <HI>violence,</HI> to &s;upport an ordinance that they could not find a <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord</HI> for!

<P N="3">3. Our mo&s;t noted fathers owned them&s;elves to be <HI>imperfect</HI> (and left us evidence enough of it's being &s;o) therefore they &s;olemnly charged
<PB N="114" REF="012655_0113_0F8BBEA26B75C350">us, not to &s;top in what they had attained. This I before proved, Ex. p. 102. To which I &s;hall now add the words of Mr. Devenport, who fled into Holland from perfecution before he came to our land; and where he <Q>Bore witne&s;s a|gain&s;t their <HI>promi&s;cuous bapti&s;ms,</HI> which (in his account) bordered very near upon a <HI>profana|tion</HI> of that holy in&s;titution. He ob&s;erved, That when a <HI>reformation</HI> of the church has been brought about in any part of the world, it has rarely been afterwards carried on any &s;tep farther than the <HI>fir&s;t reformers</HI> did &s;ucceed in their <HI>fir&s;t</HI> endeavours. He ob&s;erved that as ea&s;ily might the <HI>ark</HI> have been removed from the mountains of <HI>Ararat,</HI> where it fir&s;t grounded, as a people get any ground in re|formation, after and beyond the fir&s;t remove of the reformers. And this ob&s;ervation quickned him to embark in a de&s;ign of re|formation, wherein he might have opportuni|ty to drive things in the fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay, as near to the precept and pattern of &s;cripture as they could be driven.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Magnalia, B. 111. p. 53.</NOTE></Q> No wonder then that he bore witne&s;s here al&s;o, again&s;t their degenerating into <HI>promi&s;cuous bapti&s;ms</HI> in 1662. The effects of which were &s;o great by the year 1700, as to cau&s;e Dr. Mather, (as I before noted Ex. p. 19) to declare, that <Q>If the begun <HI>apo&s;tacy</HI> &s;hould proceed as fa&s;t for thirty years,&mdash;&s;urely it will come to that in New-England, that the <HI>mo&s;t con&s;cientious</HI> people therein will think them&s;elves concerned to <HI>gather churches out of churches.</HI></Q> How then could my heart &s;mite
<PB N="115" REF="012655_0114_0F8BBEA30C1BEA20">me for having &s;uch a concern! Rather mu&s;t not your's &s;mite you for &s;aying, <Q>The glory of New-England departs, as the modern &s;epera|tion prevails; our <HI>fathers being judges?</HI></Q> p. 112.</P>
<P>However, though our difference in &s;entiments is great, yet tis time to come to the &s;econd gene|ral head that we agree in; which is of relating <HI>facts.</HI> You &s;ay, <Q>If they are <HI>true,</HI> he has not <HI>&s;landered</HI> us; but if they are <HI>fal&s;e</HI> he <HI>has:</HI> and upon this hypothe&s;is I am ready to join i&s;&s;ue.</Q> p. 111. With this I concur, only with the pro|vi&s;o, that a due regard be paid to the golden rule in the <HI>manner</HI> of doing it; which naturally brings us to my &s;econd <HI>witne&s;s,</HI> to prove your doing the contrary before: which was; that None can be willing to have the character of their <HI>whole</HI> denomination taken from evil per&s;ons and things which may be pickt out among them. Then I quoted a pa&s;&s;age out of your &s;ermons, to &s;hew that you had done &s;o to us. Ser. p. 142. Ex. p. 5. You now &s;ay the quotation <Q>Shows that I was not giving the character of the whole de|nomination, but only of individuals.</Q> p. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">.

It is well known that when an open breach happens, either in church or &s;tate, per&s;ons of various characters and &s;entiments will re&s;ort to the new party. When the breach between Saul and David came to be known, <HI>every one that was in di&s;tre&s;s, and every one that was in debt, and di&s;contented, gathered them&s;elves unto</HI> David, <HI>and he became a Captain over
<PB N="116" REF="012655_0115_0F8BBEA7E73B26E0">them.</HI> Yet when &s;uch a character of his party as this was given, viz. <HI>There be many &s;ervants now a days that break away, every man from his ma&s;ter,</HI> it is called <HI>Railing;</HI> and we are told that the per&s;on who gave it, therein acted according to his name, which &s;ignifies, a <HI>fool</HI> or <HI>madman.</HI> 1 Sam. 22.2 and 25.10, 14, 25.</P>
<P>My third witne&s;s was to &s;hew how you had tried to deprive people of hearing and judging for them&s;elves, and had condemned us without a fair hearing. Ex. p. 5, 6. The &s;um of your reply to it is, That what you delivered was by way of warning and advice to your own people, and &s;ay, <Q>As for &s;trangers,&mdash;the whole fraternity of &s;eparates&mdash;they are entirely out of the pre&s;ent que&s;tion</Q> p. 20, 21. Yet Sir, you fir&s;t &s;pread printed propo&s;als of &s;ub&s;cription for your &s;ermons, through the country, notifying what you had therein written again&s;t the <HI>&s;epa|rates;</HI> and then the books were publi&s;hed and di&s;per&s;ed into all the four governments of New-England, and improved again&s;t our denomina|tion in general, before I wrote again&s;t them, and I never heard of any one man, that took what you had &s;aid, in the <HI>limited</HI> &s;en&s;e you would now put upon it, till your reply came out. Which limi|ted &s;en&s;e you al&s;o now fly to, for a &s;creen from my charge, of your injuring the truth in relating of facts. p. 6. We mu&s;t therefore come to par|ticulars. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. You are forced to own your&s;elf guilty of two mi&s;takes about the &s;eparate mini&s;ter in your own town. One is, you &s;aid the church &s;ilenced him: when in truth he &s;ilenced him&s;elf. The other is concerning the length of

You &s;aid, <HI>Le&s;s than a year;</HI> which &s;aying you are now forced to own was more than a year from the truth; tho' you try hard to make out that I was as much or more mi&s;taken than you was. p. 108. What you advance from the records of that church is entirely in my favour, excepting the date of Mr. Smith's excommunication, and you appear wil|ling to render them doubtful, calling them, <HI>re|cords</HI> or <HI>minutes;</HI> and what you chiefly rely up|on, is a narrative you &s;ay, <Q>Taken from Mr. Smith's own <HI>mouth,</HI> as near as could be <HI>related</HI> by a gentleman of integrity (who&s;e letter is in hand, and the <HI>&s;ub&s;tance of</HI> it is as follows.</Q>) p. 106. So that your chief authority to deter|mine the&s;e <HI>facts,</HI> by your own account, is what was taken from an aged gentleman's memory, after above 20 years changes in this confu&s;ed world, then wrote as near as another could re|member, and a third gives the public the <HI>&s;ub|&s;tance</HI> of what the &s;econd had written. Now I will give you my authorities. One of Mr. Smith's brethren in the mini&s;try, who lived by the way between Stonington and Mansfield, in giving me an account of the &s;tate of religion in tho&s;e parts, wrote thus.</P>
<P><Q>As for Stonington, brother Smith hath for &s;ome time denied to admini&s;ter among them, and <HI>now</HI> hath concluded to return to Mansfield, and hath proceeded <HI>&s;o far</HI> as to &s;ell at Stoning|ton, and bought at Mansfield; but the church unanimou&s;ly again&s;t his going.</Q> This was written on April 17, 1749. Your account makes it a year after his removal before his ex|comunication. Well my account of that is from
<PB N="118" REF="012655_0117_0F8BBEA8F1B25DC8">one of the council in which are the&s;e words. <Q>When we were come, and had heard the charge again&s;t him, as being a covenant-breaker, in that he had for&s;aken the work God had &s;et him to do, namely, of preaching the go&s;pel, and admini&s;tring the ordinances there|of; he was de&s;ired to give his rea&s;ons why he had &s;o done. He gave this an&s;wer, That there was a want of fellow&s;hip, but to charge it to the church, or any particular brother he could not: and that was all, as I remember. And then the church declared how they had taken the &s;teps pre&s;cribed in the go&s;pel for his recovery, and all proved ineffectual. We all agreed that it was duty to proceed to pub|lic cen&s;ure and excommunication.&mdash;The day was the 20th of July; but as to the effect, God has it in his hands, and he orders all things well.</Q> This was written the la&s;t of September, 1750; and I have both of the&s;e letters in their authors own hand-writing, to &s;hew to any who de&s;ire to &s;ee them. And let it be noted, that they were then wrote in way of intimate friend|&s;hip, containing our own language concerning the&s;e affairs, and not with any de&s;ign of publi&s;h|ing them to the world.</P>
<P>And by the&s;e accounts it appears, that he was ordained on <HI>December</HI> 10, 1746; but that after he had broken his &s;olemn covenant to feed that flock of God, they took the go&s;pel &s;teps with him, and as he did not <HI>hear the church,</HI> he was excommunicated <HI>July</HI> 20, 1750. Yet you de|clared in print, that <Q>Him <HI>they</HI> cho&s;e, ordain|ed, <HI>&s;ilenced,</HI> ca&s;t out of the church, and deli|vered

And now, twenty years after, you have collected a reproachful account of that affair from this dilinquent; and yet at the end of it (to avoid the charge of <HI>&s;tigmatizing</HI> your breth|ren) you &s;ay, <Q>I have ONLY rehear&s;ed their deeds&mdash;I have ONLY publi&s;hed their princi|ples, &s;pirit, practices, &amp;c. which THEY <HI>them|&s;elves</HI> PROFESSED and acted over in the open view of the world.</Q> p. 110 Though but two pages back you was forced to own to the world, that you had publi&s;hed things again&s;t them that were not true; and that you was led to do it by <Q>Relying upon the <HI>information</HI> of <HI>neigh|bours,</HI> and your own <HI>under&s;tanding</HI> of that affair.</Q></P>
<P>O Mr. <HI>Fi&s;h!</HI> how much guilt and trouble would you have e&s;caped, if you had hone&s;tly re|tracted all that you have done again&s;t your bre|thren, through a <HI>leaning to your own under&s;tand|ing,</HI> and acting contrary to the character of Zion's citizens?

<P N="2">2. You Sir charged us with <HI>de&s;pi&s;ing learning,</HI> and &s;aid we had <HI>None</HI> but <HI>unlearned teachers,</HI> and that we did not <HI>u&s;e means</HI> for obtaining <HI>any better accompli&s;hments.</HI> Ser. p. 165. And now in order to maintain your charge, you would li|mit the controver&s;y to the word <HI>college;</HI> whereas the words in your charge were, ANY <HI>means; col|leges,</HI> AND <HI>&s;uperior &s;chools.</HI> And when I named two &s;ons of Mr. Jo&s;iah Cleaveland of Canterbury, that he &s;ent to college, you a&s;&s;ert that he did it

Ex. p. 42, 43. who could be &s;o &s;tupid as to &s;end more &s;ons there to be ex|pelled! When that expelling temper was a lit|tle over, I mentioned no le&s;s than &s;ix in&s;tances, out of but two towns, of &s;eparates &s;ending their &s;ons to college. Ex. p. 43. But you pre&s;ume to que&s;tion their doing of it from right motives: and becau&s;e your party have prevailed to preju|dice &s;everal of tho&s;e &s;ons again&s;t their fathers principles, you advance that as a great proof that their fathers are erroneous, p. 15. And as I &s;poke of &s;ome of our pa&s;tors having &s;kill in the learned tongues, you name one of them, who at his earne&s;t reque&s;t was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from Norwich, and you &s;ay he has <Q>Di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf, to the honor of truth &amp; <HI>go&s;pel order,</HI> by a public reflec|tion upon him&s;elf for his error, in promoting &s;eparations from the &s;tanding churches, &s;o much as he has done; and was &s;ome months

<P>Reply, I learn that the mini&s;ters did extort from him &s;ome general reflections upon &s;epara|tions; yet the <HI>order</HI> that he was &s;ettled in was; dropping the old <HI>con&s;titution,</HI> and beginning anew by a verbal relation of experiences; not u&s;ing the civil law for his &s;upport, and not u&s;ing notes in his preaching. And I am informed, that he lately a&s;&s;i&s;ted in ordaining a mini&s;ter in your vici|nity, who appears to be a man of <HI>&s;piritual gifts,</HI> though he has no more of college-learning than we had. And whether this can convince us that we were wrong in &s;eparating from <HI>your con&s;titu|tion,</HI> that we might introduce <HI>&s;uch go&s;pel order</HI> (and which now &s;preads in your colony) let the reader judge! You clo&s;e this article with telling your readers, that you had <HI>&s;ufficiently proved</HI> your charge again&s;t us, but if any thing more is re|quired, the <HI>&s;pirit</HI> and <HI>language</HI> of my book may &s;upply the place of <HI>many witne&s;&s;es.</HI> p. 15. I am content to refer the matter to that te&s;t; for I tru&s;t it has appeared, and will appear to the end, that God has given me a real regard for <HI>knowledge</HI> and <HI>truth,</HI> but a hatred of <HI>ignorance</HI> and <HI>&s;ophi&s;try.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. In opening your con&s;titution I mentioned the trouble that Norwich repre&s;entatives met with for their oppo&s;ing their mini&s;ters attempts to bring in the Saybrook &s;cheme, and &s;aid that, Af|ter many councils, and much fatigue, a <HI>&s;um of money</HI> prevailed with that mini&s;ter to quit his place. Ex. p. 29. You now &s;ay, The &s;um of money was <HI>only</HI> for his temporal intere&s;t in the town. p. 72. To which I reply, that I had no
<PB N="122" REF="012655_0121_0F8BBEABCCFAC4E8">thought of blaming him for felling his e&s;tate there, thought I had an account of that from the &s;ame hands that I had the other; but as I find from the town records, that upon re&s;igning his office, he made a demand of old arearages, beyond what the town judged to be any ways his due, I &s;uppo&s;e that from thence it was taken that a cer|tain &s;um was given him to quit his place. This is the cleare&s;t light I can as yet gain in the ca&s;e. I am willing to have every mi&s;take rectified, and that things may appear as they are. Had that been your temper Sir, would you have &s;aid A <HI>council.</HI> p. 72? as if he had been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by the calling only of <HI>one</HI> council; when in truth they had them year after year, from &s;oon after the introduction of the Saybrook plan in 1708, till that mini&s;ter re&s;igned his office on Augu&s;t 31, 1716. And would not an impartial di&s;po&s;ition al&s;o have prevented, a long de&s;cant that you there add, upon Mr. Tennant's <HI>language,</HI> in order to turn it again&s;t us; when I expre&s;sly told you, that it was his <HI>rea&s;oning</HI> and not his language that I approved of? Ex. p. 33. At the &s;ame time you pa&s;s over in &s;ilence what I brought again&s;t you from Mr. Edwards, which I as plain|ly told you I preferred before the other. Is this the <HI>learning</HI> you plead &s;o much for!</P>
<P N="4">4. You &s;pend &s;ix pages upon the facts that I related concerning Canterbury, on which you reflect that <Q>'Tis &s;ad that Mr. <HI>B.</HI> lays no re&s;traint on his pen!</Q> p. 79. And you &s;ay, <Q>This may &s;erve as a general caution to his readers, how they receive and rely upon his account of things in other parts of his book,</Q> p. 80. And give no hint that I
<PB N="123" REF="012655_0122_0F8BBEAC8658CD38">took every article which you controvert, from an author in that town, who was acquainted with all the&s;e affairs, and publickly appealed to mi|ni&s;ters and courts for the truth of his narrative; and which I never heard di&s;puted till your reply came out, while you keep your author's name concealed, who condemns me upon his pre&s;ent <HI>rememberance.</HI> p. 77. As far as I could now gain light from the &s;everal accounts that are given, I have corrected and opened the true &s;tate of that &s;eparation; but whether I can with &s;afety retract any particular circum&s;tance that is now di&s;puted, which was publi&s;hed 20 years ago, by a man of credit that I was acquainted with, only upon the <HI>memory</HI> of one that I knew not, let the reader judge! And I &s;hall clo&s;e the&s;e facts with remarking, that you catch at my &s;ay|ing, <HI>After</HI> the church withdrew, the con&s;ociation was called and ordained Mr. Cog&s;well, Ex. p. 38. as a proof that they did not <HI>cau&s;e that divi&s;ion.</HI> Rom. 16.17.18. p. 84. But Sir, I proved by the plain te&s;timony of the heads of your col|lege, that his <HI>preaching to the pari&s;h</HI> (which cau&s;|ed the church to withdraw) was <HI>with the &s;pecial direction</HI> of tho&s;e mini&s;ters. Ex. p. 42. And what a mi&s;erable &s;hift is it, for you to catch at the word <HI>after,</HI> to prove that they did nothing be|fore!</P>
<P>And now Sir, let us &s;um up the whole affair. You have accu&s;ed me with u&s;ing fal&s;e argu|ments, but how have you proved it? The fir&s;t that I ob&s;erve, is from my naming &s;ome of our mini&s;ters, who had been men of note in the places where they lived; you repre&s;ent that from thence I argued, that they had college learning
<PB N="124" REF="012655_0123_0F8BBEADAE518758">(as if all learning was confined to colleges) and you form a ridiculous &s;yllogi&s;m for me according|ly. p. 13. But whether you or I are rendered mo&s;t ridiculous by it, let the reader judge. A|gain, when I ob&s;erved that you <HI>mi&s;took</HI> the rule it&s;elf through your book; my argument from it was, That nothing le&s;s could be expected, than fal&s;e actings upon a fal&s;e rule. Ex. p. 5. That is when a man is &s;educed into a <HI>crooked</HI> way, it cannot be expected that he will go <HI>&s;trait</HI> in it. But you repre&s;ent my argument to be, that you could not have an <HI>hone&s;t heart.</HI> p. 19. Notwith|&s;tanding I expre&s;sly &s;aid, <Q>I de&s;ire always to avoid the evil of judging the <HI>coun&s;els</HI> of others <HI>hearts,</HI> and to judge righteou&s;ly according to what is made manife&s;t.</Q> And I went on to tell what I &s;uppo&s;ed it was that <HI>blinded</HI> you. Ex. p. 5, 6. And I &s;till &s;uppo&s;e that you have been thus blinded, and moved to u&s;e &s;hifts and eva&s;ions to try to clear your&s;elf, and unrea&s;on|bly to cen&s;ure your opponent. Thus when I &s;aid, you had condemned <HI>us</HI> without a fair hearing; you reply <Q>They were out of my juri&s;diction. I had no bu&s;ine&s;s to call <HI>them</HI> to a hearing.</Q> p. 21. As if I had &s;poken of a <HI>per&s;onal audience:</HI> when you know that I expre&s;sly referred to what we had <HI>publi&s;hed</HI> to the world, which you had paid no regard to. Ex. p. 6. So when I mentioned what the fal&s;e teachers at Corinth <HI>gloried</HI> in, and (to confirm it) what the Corinthi|ans <HI>&s;uffered</HI> from them. Ex. p. 25, 26. You &s;huffle the matter over, till you would make your readers believe, that I held, that tho&s;e teach|ers <HI>glorying</HI> was in what the &s;aints <HI>&s;uffered</HI> from them. And though you will not allow that
<PB N="125" REF="012655_0124_0F8BBEAE35292180">Chri&s;t gave any orders to his apo&s;tles to preach freely, yet you have proved that Paul did preach &s;o; and you carry it, that his de&s;ign therein was to "cut off occa&s;ion of <HI>offence.</HI>" p. 68, 69. But I have no thought of his being afraid of <HI>offend|ing</HI> tho&s;e teachers; for what he was evidently concerned about was to prevent any occa&s;ion or handle for them to do mi&s;chief. Once more, When I ob&s;erved that the epi&s;tles to Timothy and Titus were to direct mini&s;ters concerning their behaviour <HI>in the church,</HI> not <HI>over it.</HI> I im|mediately went on to explain my meaning; and that by <HI>over it,</HI> I meant a di&s;tinct power or juri&s;|diction <HI>above</HI> the church, in&s;tead of acting <HI>with</HI> them in trying mini&s;ters. Ex. p. 39, 41. But you Sir, quote &s;everal texts wherein the word <HI>over</HI> is u&s;ed to de&s;cribe mini&s;ters work as <HI>watch|men</HI> or <HI>guides</HI> to the church, which perfectly agrees with my &s;en&s;e of the word <HI>in</HI> it, as being <HI>leaders</HI> therein; while you go on, (as before ob&s;erved) to a&s;&s;ert, that what the <HI>Spirit &s;aith unto the churches</HI> was "&s;poken to and <HI>of</HI> the mini&s;ters;" and pro|ceed till you repre&s;ent, that I held that letters of commendation went <HI>to</HI> and <HI>from</HI> the <HI>brotherhood</HI> and <HI>not</HI> the <HI>mini&s;ters,</HI> though I plainly &s;aid the church <HI>with</HI> them. p. 80&mdash;83.</P>
<P>And &s;o I think it is lamentably evident. that you have proceeded in a crooked way through the&s;e writings, both as to arguments, and facts: while I have not been able to di&s;cover that I have u&s;ed one fal&s;e argument again&s;t you; and the chief mi&s;takes that I have found are, my writing The form, in&s;tead of A form of God|line&s;s; and my being mi&s;informed about one circum&s;tance at Norwich.</P>

<P>The&s;e are the two plaine&s;t proofs, in their "native dre&s;s," of my want of good manners, that you have found in my whole book, and both of them delivered by way of query: whereas I have already referred you to one pa&s;&s;age (among many) in your &s;ermons, wherein you Sir, as a public mini&s;ter, deliver it not as a que&s;tion, but a &s;trong a&s;&s;ertion, that <Q>'Twas a <HI>fal&s;e &s;pirit,</HI> and a <HI>fal&s;e religion</HI> that made the &s;eparation among US, a device of <HI>&s;atan</HI> that old <HI>&s;erpent</HI> the <HI>devil.</HI></Q> And in your pre&s;ent piece, which tells us in its introduction, that <Q>There is not the lea&s;t need of one <HI>bitter word,</HI> nor unkind <HI>reflection,</HI> nor can there ANY <HI>purpo&s;e</HI> be an&s;wered thereby, but <HI>venting the corruption of nature,</HI></Q> p. 3.

<P>If all the&s;e <HI>words</HI> are gentle, I know not what you would have more but <HI>blows</HI> from the &s;ecular arm. However it all &s;erves &s;till further to open the ca&s;e we are upon.

Therefore when &s;ome were rai&s;ed up to appear boldly again&s;t their corruptions, they had recour&s;e to many &s;hifts and eva&s;ions, to hide the true &s;tate of the controver&s;y, while they <HI>vented their natures</HI> as you have done, by calling the wor&s;t names, and u&s;ing the mo&s;t odious compari&s;ons, that their <HI>learning</HI> afforded. And I am bold in it, that &s;uch kind of <HI>manners</HI> from men of your &s;ort of education, was not only a great cau&s;e of our &s;eparation, but al&s;o has done more towards prejudiceing peoples minds again&s;t college-learning, than all tho&s;e you call lay-teachers could have done if they had

Jer. 51.64. Rev. 2.20.

<P>DR. <HI>Gill</HI> ob&s;erves, that there has been &s;carce any thing wrote by us the&s;e fifty years but in our own defence; our Pedobapti&s;t brethren being continually the aggre&s;&s;ors, and fir&s;t movers of the controver&s;y; they &s;eem as if they were not &s;atisfied with what has been done on their &s;ide; and therefore are always attempting, either to put the controver&s;y upon a new foot, or to throw the old arguments into a new form; and even &s;ay the &s;ame things over and over again, to make their minds, and the minds of their people ea&s;y, if po&s;&s;ible. But this is our ca&s;e; if we reply to what is written again&s;t us, then we are litigious per&s;ons, and lovers of controver&s;y; though we only ri&s;e up in our own vindication, for which &s;urely we are not to be blamed; and if we make no reply, then what is written is un|an&s;werable by us, and we are triumphed over.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dr. Gill's an&s;wer to a piece called,</HI> The bapti&s;m of in+fants a rea&s;onable &s;ervice, founded upon &s;cripture and apo&s;tolic tradition. <HI>p. 3, 4.</HI></NOTE> Which ob&s;ervation is as applicable to our coun|try

Yet one of the greate&s;t ma&s;ters of learning in our nation ob|&s;erves, that commonly the mo&s;t <HI>material words</HI> in controver&s;y, upon which the argument turns, are &s;o u&s;ed; though &s;ays he, <Q>one who &s;hould &s;peak thus, in the affairs and bu&s;ine&s;s of the world, and call 7 &s;ometimes 8, and &s;ometimes nine, as be&s;t &s;erved his advantage, would pre&s;ently have clapped upon him one of the two names

<P>With grief of heart we often &s;ee this to be the ca&s;e, with the advocates for infant bapti&s;m. Could they once be brought to a di&s;tinct and &s;teady meaning in three words, the controver&s;y would &s;oon come to an end. I mean the words, covenant, grace and promi&s;e. It is evident that in the old te&s;tament, to be in Abraham's <HI>covenant,</HI> meant the &s;ame as to be members of that church, and under obligation to conform to all its ordi|nances. Natural birth brought his &s;eed into the church, and being in, all their males mu&s;t needs be circumci&s;ed as &s;oon as they were <HI>clean.</HI> Levit. 12, 2, 3. <HI>And all their males</HI> were requir|ed to keep the pa&s;&s;over in the fir&s;t month, if <HI>clean</HI> and not in a journey; and if that were the ca&s;e, they might not neglect it any longer than the next month, upon the penalty of being <HI>cut off from their people,</HI> Gen. 17.14. Num. 9.9&mdash;13. Deut. 16.16. and do any hold the <HI>covenant</HI> to be &s;o with us? Indeed &s;ome of our mo&s;t noted fathers &s;ay, <Q>We know of NO &s;tronger argu|ment for infant bapti&s;m than this, That <HI>church members</HI> are to be baptized.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Magnalia B. 5. p. 79.</NOTE></Q> And from the &s;criptures ju&s;t now cited, 'tis evident,
<PB N="134" REF="012655_0133_0F8BBEBF777FA828">that Abraham's &s;eed <HI>born in the church,</HI> and there|fore mu&s;t be <HI>cut off</HI> from it, if they were not cir|cumci&s;ed at the appointed time; and mu&s;t we then take our opponents, by <HI>grace</HI> to mean <HI>nature;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Directly contrary to having, NO <HI>confidence in the fle&s;h.</HI> Phil. 3.3.</NOTE> and that <HI>nature</HI> brings their &s;eed into the covenant of <HI>grace!</HI> And that though the go&s;pel church was fir&s;t con&s;tituted of members who were <HI>born not of blood</HI> nor of the <HI>will of man</HI> but OF GOD. John. 1.13! yet that &s;ince the e&s;tabli&s;hment of chri&s;tianity, <HI>blood</HI> and the <HI>will of man,</HI> can bring members into the church! But why then do not all the&s;e members come to the ordinance of the &s;upper, as the Jews did to the pa&s;&s;over? our author's an&s;wer is, That the pa&s;&s;over was temporary and <HI>legal,</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Circumci&s;ion was as <HI>temporary</HI> and <HI>legal</HI> as the pa&s;&s;over, and is much oftener &s;poken of as &s;uch. Rom. 2.25. Gal. 5.2, 3. and 6.13.</NOTE> and he &s;ays, <Q>If it had been the will of the great Head of the church, not to have appointed any go&s;pel pa&s;&s;o|ver or holy &s;upper for his church, that would not have altered the privileges of the <HI>promi&s;es</HI> relating to bapti&s;m in Abraham's covenant, one way or the other.</Q> p. 37. 38.</P>
<P>To which I reply, that if he had not appointed bapti&s;m nor the &s;upper, it would not have altered the <HI>promi&s;es</HI> to Abraham, for there is no mention of either of tho&s;e ordinances therein; but 'tis certain that the promi&s;es to him did in&s;ure the con|tinuance of the church in the line of his po&s;terity till the <HI>&s;eed Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hould come, <HI>to whom the pro|mi&s;es were made.</HI> Gal. 3.16. And till then their e&s;tabli&s;hment in all the <HI>legal ceremonies</HI> was
<PB N="135" REF="012655_0134_0F8BBEC207B8FD60"><HI>as God promi&s;ed</HI> him. Deut. 29.13. But when Chri&s;t came, all the children of Abraham's <HI>fle&s;h,</HI> who believed not in him, were broken off from the church of God, while the <HI>children of promi&s;e,</HI> the <HI>election of grace</HI> were retained therein; and a <HI>new covenant</HI> was made with them <HI>not according</HI> to that made with their fathers; and many of the children of Japheth were <HI>per&s;uaded,</HI> and graf|fed in among them, and <HI>&s;tood</HI> there <HI>by faith.</HI> Rom. 9.7.8 &amp; 11. and 5.17.20. Heb. 8. All which may plainly teach us, that to be in <HI>cove|nant,</HI> means the &s;ame as being in the church, both in the old te&s;tament, and in the new; and that <HI>grace</HI> means <HI>free &s;alvation</HI> by Chri&s;t, whom Abra|ham and other believers looked to, through the &s;hadows of the law, and who is now beheld with open face through the gla&s;s of the go&s;pel; and that the ble&s;&s;ings that God <HI>promi&s;ed</HI> to Abraham, which are come on the Gentiles, are <HI>forgive|ne&s;s of &s;ins,</HI> and the influences of the holy <HI>&s;pirit;</HI> which <HI>promi&s;e is given to them that believe.</HI> Acts 2.38, 39, 41. Gal. 3.13, 14, 22.</P>
<P>This is evidently the &s;trait line of truth, but the crooked way of <HI>deceitful</HI> philo&s;ophy and men's <HI>traditions,</HI> as it carried Peter and Barnabas away with <HI>di&s;&s;imulation,</HI> &s;o it has carried this author (let him be ever &s;o pious) into the following evils.</P>
<P N="1">1. To <HI>add</HI> to God's word; for that word calls the covenant that formed Abraham's family into a church, <HI>The covenant of circumci&s;ion.</HI> Acts 7.8. And as all know that circumci&s;ion is out of date, it would appear the evident con&s;equence, that the covenant which it gave name to is al&s;o <HI>taken away,</HI> and a better one <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed</HI> in it's room. Heb. 8, 6. and 10.9. Had not men pre&s;umed
<PB N="136" REF="012655_0135_0F8BBEC2EA6E55D0">to add the name <HI>grace</HI> to it, on which addition mo&s;t of their arguments for infant bapti&s;m turn. And to &s;upport this they make another additi|on; for where the word &s;ays of Abraham, <HI>He re|ceived</HI> the <HI>&s;ign</HI> of circumci&s;ion, a <HI>&s;eal</HI> of the righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>the faith which he had.</HI> Rom. 4.11. This writer is &s;o daring as to a&s;&s;ert, that Abraham <Q>has &s;et us the mo&s;t public example in <HI>applying</HI> the &s;eal of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of faith to his in|fant &s;eed, at God's command; which &s;eal now is bapti&s;m.</Q> p. 29. In which, unle&s;s he can make Abraham's <HI>receiving</HI> what <HI>he had</HI> faith in, to be the &s;ame as <HI>applying</HI> to others what they had no faith about, he will be found guilty of adding to God's word. Yea he not only adds what is not there, but 2. He al&s;o denies what is there; for he over and over denies, there being any <HI>expre&s;s</HI> word again&s;t bringing infants into the church now, as they did among the Jews. p. 13, 33, 39, 40. Notwith&s;tanding God's expre&s;s declaration, That the new covenant is <HI>not accord|ing</HI> to the covenant that took in profe&s;&s;ors by <HI>hou&s;holds,</HI> and that the extent of the new cove|nant is, that ALL &s;hall <HI>know him,</HI> from the LEAST to the greate&s;t. Heb. 8.11. Which declara|tion our great author tries to evade by a&s;&s;erting, That the apo&s;tle here did not refer to the cove|nant of Abraham, <Q>which had the token of cir|cumci&s;ion annexed to it.</Q> p. 15. And though he owns that the u&s;ual language of the new-te&s;ta|ment is, repent and believe and be baptized, yet he &s;ays, <Q>We do not di&s;cover the lea&s;t oppo&s;iti|on to the practice of infant bapti&s;m, which takes place and follows upon our vi&s;ible and credible profe&s;&s;ion.</Q> p. 34. But &s;tay; how
<PB N="137" REF="012655_0136_0F8BBEC318F22390">does it follow? Abraham had no warrant to circumci&s;e one per&s;on, but &s;uch as were either <HI>born in his hou&s;e,</HI> or <HI>bought with his money.</HI> Gen. 17.13, 23. The fir&s;t order that was given to bring <HI>&s;trangers</HI> to circumci&s;ion by <HI>hou&s;holds,</HI> was on <HI>the day</HI> that I&s;rael came out of Egypt, Exod. 12.48. and the covenant which Jeremiah prophe&s;ied of, and which Paul applies to the go&s;pel di&s;pen|&s;ation is placed in <HI>expre&s;s</HI> oppo&s;ition to what was done on <HI>that day.</HI> Therefore all tho&s;e who bring any family to bapti&s;m upon the faith of the head of it, act directly again&s;t the&s;e &s;criptures; and in order to keep them&s;elves in countenance in that way, they go on, 3. To abu&s;ive treatment of tho&s;e who will not go with them. This writer repre&s;ents that our &s;entiments, would make Paul to contradict him&s;elf, which none but a <HI>prejudiced</HI> or <HI>infidel</HI> mind will admit. p. 16. He tells us of <HI>incredible pre&s;umption;</HI> of oppo&s;ing the <HI>exact ful|filment</HI> of his text, and that tho&s;e who <Q>oppo&s;e infant bapti&s;m, are in danger of <HI>fighting a|gain&s;t God</HI> (at unawares).</Q> p. 23.24. Of rai&s;|ing an unan&s;werable objection in the minds of the Jews; and of too much re&s;embling <HI>them</HI> in <HI>their unbelief.</HI> p. 25. Of offering <HI>violence to the &s;criptures.</HI> p. 28. Of <HI>horrible</HI> &s;entiments. p. 38. And all to enforce his advice, to <HI>&s;hun</HI> the doc|trines and practices of &s;uch as <HI>oppo&s;e</HI> his opinion about <HI>children.</HI> p. 39. Nay all this is not enough, but 4. He mu&s;t add one of the wor&s;t errors of popery; I mean that of the &s;acraments <HI>con|ferring grace by the operation or work done.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here note, I don't charge Mr. <HI>F.</HI> with knowingly holding this error; he declares the contrary. p. 38. and would have it, that when the fathers called bapti&s;m <HI>regene|ration,</HI> they u&s;ed the thing &s;ignified for the &s;ign. p. 43. But the ca&s;e is evidently not &s;o. I readily own that circumci&s;ion under the law, and bapti&s;m under the go&s;pel, were both &s;igns of Chri&s;t's death, and of regeneration by his grace; and as Abraham had the thing &s;ignified before he received circum|ci&s;ion, it was a &s;eal to him of the faith he had; and at God's command he applied the &s;ign of what was then future, to &s;uch as had not the thing &s;ignified wrought in them: but 'tis in vain for any to &s;ay. They &s;tand to act for their children as Abraham did for his, unle&s;s they can prove that a <HI>national church</HI> is to &s;pring from them, and that a Saviour is here|after to come out of it. Bapti&s;m is not a type of a future crucifixion of the Saviour, but a token of that great event which is pa&s;t, and that we <HI>are crucified with him,</HI> and HAVE <HI>put him on.</HI> Gal. 2.20. and 3.27. And to put this &s;ign upon our children, unle&s;s we imagine with Origen, that BY it the inward change is wrought, is to do &s;o much toward making our children hypocrites. The We&s;tmin&s;ter-catechi&s;m calls bapti&s;m, a &s;ign of our <HI>engrafting into Chri&s;t,</HI> therefore to put this &s;ign on any before we have &s;ome go&s;pel evidence that they have been made <HI>dead to the law,</HI> what is it but <HI>adultery!</HI> Rom. 7.3.4.</NOTE> For
<PB N="138" REF="012655_0137_0F8BBEC3CB044060">as a full evidence for infant bapti&s;m, he from Mr. Bo&s;twick, gives us Origen's words that <Q>It is becau&s;e <HI>by</HI> the &s;acrament of bapti&s;m the <HI>pol|lution of our birth is taken away,</HI> that infants are baptized.</Q> p. 44. Origen is the fir&s;t man that any of them have ever been able to produce, who expre&s;sly appeared for infant bap|ti&s;m, and his argument to &s;upport it is, becau&s;e he &s;ays, BY it the <HI>pollution of our birth is taken away.</HI> But Tertullian in the &s;ame age oppo&s;ed the practice, as our author owns, p. 45. And yet in p. 47, he would have his readers believe, that there was "No di&s;pute about the point," for more than a thou&s;and years after the apo&s;tles. And then to bind the whole he &s;ays, <Q>Infant bapti&s;m is valid, and agreeable to the in&s;titu|tion

<P N="2">2. The <HI>my&s;tery of iniquity</HI> began to work in the apo&s;tles days, 2 The&s;. 2.7. and had prevailed &s;o far when infant bapti&s;m was introduced, as al&s;o to bring infants to the Lord's &s;upper, as a <HI>&s;aving ordinance:</HI> and likewi&s;e to u&s;e the &s;ign of the cro&s;s, Godfathers, renouncing the devil and his works, exorci&s;ms, dipping the head thrice in reference to the three per&s;ons in the Trinity, con&s;ecrating the water, anointing with oil, &amp;c. at bapti&s;m; for all which Dr. Gill has produced plain and <HI>expre&s;s</HI> preofs, out of the &s;ame fathers that are quoted for infant bapti&s;m, and of as <HI>early</HI> date; and he ob&s;erves, that the rea&s;onings for in|fant bapti&s;m that are u&s;ed <Q>From the te&s;timony of the antients, the <HI>difficulty</HI> of an innovation, and the <HI>ea&s;ine&s;s</HI> of its detection, may be applied to all and each of the&s;e rites.

<P>From whence I leave the reader to judge, what cau&s;e we had for a new &s;eparation; and &s;hall clo&s;e the whole with ob&s;erving, That denying the intire depravity of nature, and the ab&s;olute &s;ove|reignty of grace, and holding that the pro|mi&s;es threof are connected with the de&s;ires and doings of natural men, and that their final &s;tate turns upon their well or ill improving their free-will power, and that a man may finally fall from grace received, are the dregs of popery, which &s;ince the reformation have been called Armini|ani&s;m; while excluding, or di&s;regarding the au|thority of the divine law, is Antinomiani&s;m: both of which names the principle of beliver's bapti&s;m has often been reproached with; while yet we are con&s;tantly complained of becau&s;e we will not be either Arminians or Antinomians, or both of them. For what is all the noi&s;e we hear, of our children's being in covenant, or el&s;e that if they die in infancy we can have no hope of them, without it be from the unco|venanted (i. e. &s;overeign) mercy of God? And that (either by birth or by men's <HI>works</HI> in baptizing of them) they are in the <HI>covenant of grace</HI> and children of <HI>promi&s;e,</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Our author refers to &s;everal ancient promi&s;es, &s;o God's people, of the pouring of his Spirit on their offspring, which he compares with Act 2.3., and &s;ays, <Q>The promi&s;e is the immediate privilege of believing parents, and their children, as it's expre&s;&s;ed in the pre&s;ent time, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> may not be &s;o divided as to be the immediate privilege of the believing parents, and the future privilege of their children when they &s;hall believe.</Q> p. 30.

<P>On the other hand, our apponents hold it to be the law of Chri&s;t, that all believers &s;hould bap|tize their children, and yet will call tho&s;e <HI>regular</HI> bapti&s;ts, who will join in their churches, without bringing their infants, or acting in the bapti&s;m them&s;elves, as they believe the law of Chri&s;t di|rects. And though our opponents hold with us, that it is the law of Chri&s;t, that all &s;hould be baptized before they come to the Lord's table; yet many of them accu&s;e us of rigidne&s;s, of un|churching all but our&s;elves, &amp;c. only becau&s;e we

We have two &s;orts of &s;eparation de&s;cribed in holy writ: One is produced by an exalting of &s;elf above others; the other by &s;uch an adherence to divine rule as to part with tho&s;e who will not conform to it.

<P>I am &s;en&s;ible that this author, after owning that in &s;cripture we <Q>Have <HI>no expre&s;s</HI> account about the baptizing of the infant &s;eed of be|lievers:</Q> p. 32. yet tells us of <Q>&s;training at a gnat and &s;wallowing a camel,</Q> becau&s;e we will
<PB N="144" REF="012655_0143_0F8BBECEAEB44C80">not admit that practice upon the covenant of cir|cumci&s;ion. p. 33. But as 'tis evident to us, that men have <HI>changed the ordinance,</HI> from burying to &s;prinkling; and, from tho&s;e who are taught and believe, to applying it to &s;ubjects before they are capable of being taught, without any divine warrant at all; let this change be called a gnat or a camel, or what el&s;e they plea&s;e, yet I tru&s;t it will ever appear too big to be &s;wallowed, by tho&s;e who duly attend to the orders of our great Lord and Ma&s;ter, which are; <Q>Go ye and <HI>teach</HI> all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Gho&s;t; teaching them to OBSERVE ALL THINGS, WHATSOEVER I HAVE COMMANDED you; and lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.

<P><HI>N. B.</HI> Where (Ex. with figures added thereto occurs) it refers to pages in my examination of Mr. <HI>Jo&s;eph Fi&s;h</HI>'s nine &s;ermons, where the &s;ame points as here are treated of.</P>
<P>A Reply to Mr. <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> under the&s;e heads. 1. Of the ma|terials of Chri&s;t's vi&s;ible church; which are proved to be only profe&s;&s;ing believers: and his arguments for infant|bapti&s;m are di&s;tinctly an&s;wered. p. 4&mdash;17. (Ex. p. 12, 13, 97&mdash;129.</P>
<P N="2">2. Of the manner of building churches. Chri&s;t has in&s;ti|tuted none but particular churches, which are tobe built up by per&s;ons giving a verbal account of a work of God's Spirit on their &s;ouls, to the church, in order to their being received as members. p. 17&mdash;23. (Ex. p. 17&mdash;19, 31, 49, 50. Te&s;timonies to confirm this, from Dr. Owen, p. 18, 58&mdash;60. Capt. Clap, p. 54. Mr. Eliot, p. 55. Mr. Shepard, p. 57, 95. Mr. Mitchel, p. 19, 51, 56. Dr. Mather, p. 17&mdash;19.)</P>
<P N="3">3. Of organizing churches. The power both of appro|bating and ordaining mini&s;ters proved to be in the churches, and none have a right to act therein only as they are ap|pointed thereto by the church. p. 23&mdash;33. (Ex. p. 16, 24, 40, 41, 60&mdash;63. This confirmed by the example of our fathers, p. 16, 52. and by Dr. Owen, p. 64, 69, 70.)</P>
<P N="4">4. Of the difference between civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical go|vernment. p. 33&mdash;51. (Ex. p. 20&mdash;32.)</P>
<P>The go&s;pel method of &s;upporting mini&s;ters opened, and the evils of u&s;ing force in the ca&s;e de&s;cribed. p. 35, &amp;c. (Ex. p. 20, 24&mdash;27, 29, 30, 46&mdash;48, 74&mdash;82.)</P>
<P N="5">5. Of &s;eparation; the cau&s;e and nature of our's. p. 51.</P>
<P N="1">1. It was becau&s;e church and world were confounded toge|ther. p. 52&mdash;56. (Ex. p. 20, 50, 51, 94. This confirm|ed by Dr. I. Mather, p. 19. Dr. Cotton Mather, p. 37. Mr. Mitchel, p. 51. Dr. Owen. p. 85&mdash;88.)</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="146" REF="012655_0145_0F8BBECFD52B01A0">
2. Becau&s;e human learning was put in the place of the gifts of the Spirit, to qualify mini&s;ters. p. 56&mdash;59. (Ex. p. 41&mdash;45. This confirmed by Mr. Tennant, p. 33. Mr. Edwards, p. 34, 68. Mr. Prince, p. 52. Dr. Frank, p. 53. Mr. Porter, p. 68, 69. Dr. Owen, p. 86.)</P>
<P N="3">3. Becau&s;e go&s;pel liberty in &s;uch affairs was denied. p. 59&mdash;66. (Ex. p. 38&mdash;41, 46&mdash;48, 50&mdash;53. This con|firmed from Mr. Tennant, p. 34. Mr. Edwards, p. 34. Dr. Owen, p. 83, 86, 88. Dr. Frank, p. 84, 90.)</P>
<P N="4">4. Becau&s;e unwarranted ways of wor&s;hip were practi&s;ed among us. p. 66. (Ex. p. 72, 102, &amp;c.)</P>
<P N="5">5. Becau&s;e go&s;pel di&s;cipline was neglected and changed into a worldly dominion. p. 67. (Ex. p. 20, 28&mdash;31, 51. Dr. Owen upon it. p. 85&mdash;87.)</P>
<P N="6">6. Becau&s;e of mini&s;ter's &s;etting up them&s;elves, and in&s;tead of preaching to edi&s;ication, treating tho&s;e who would not &s;ubmit to them with a great deal of abu&s;e. p. 67, &amp;c. (Ex. p. 35, 84, 90, 91, 94.)</P>
<P>An addre&s;s to Mr. <HI>Jo&s;eph Fi&s;h,</HI>&mdash;giving the rea&s;ons for my writing, p. 79. And &s;hewing to him that he has in his arguments to &s;upport the &s;tanding churches, been guilty,</P>
<P N="1">1. Of &s;etting <HI>them&s;elves</HI> up as a &s;tandard in&s;tead of divine truth, p. 83.</P>
<P N="2">2. Of u&s;ing &s;cripture words without duly regarding their meaning, p. 87.</P>
<P N="3">3. Of blending truth and error together in many in&s;tances, in order to gain his argument, p. 91.</P>
<P N="4">4. Of violating the golden rule &s;o much as to endeavor to draw their own character only by their virtues or good pretences; and that of their opponents only by their imper|fections, p. 99.</P>
<P>Our fathers like conduct will condemn, and not excu&s;e him herein, p. 101.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Fi&s;h</HI> in the&s;e proceedings has gro&s;sly mi&s;repre&s;ented &s;everal facts, p. 116.</P>
<P>And has &s;hewn a wrong temper: &s;o that according to his own conce&s;&s;ions he is guilty both of &s;ophi&s;try and &s;lander, p. 126.</P>
<P>APPENDIX, &s;hewing that the advocates for infant-bap|ti&s;m proceed in an ob&s;cure and un&s;teady u&s;e of words, which carries them away into additions to God's word, and a denial of what is therein; al&s;o to abu&s;e their neighbours, and countenance popery, Arminiani&s;m and Antinomiani&s;m.</P>

HAVING thus &s;ummed up the matter in &s;hort terms, the author has one earne&s;t reque&s;t to make to all his readers; and that is, That they would always be careful to di&s;tingui&s;h between the characters of men and the truth of God. He de&s;ires to be far from &s;etting him&s;elf up in com|pari&s;on, much le&s;s in competition, with many great and good men, who have practi&s;ed in|fant bapti&s;m, and other things which he op|po&s;es. If tho&s;e practices cannot be vindicated from divine truth, the characters of men can't do it, but only &s;erve to perplex and keep &s;ouls in bondage. The goodne&s;s of David's character could never make that proceeding of his to be right, which he was moved to by <HI>&s;atan;</HI> neither could the badne&s;s of Joab's character, make it wrong for him to look upon that conduct to be <HI>abominable.</HI> 1 Chron. 21.1, 6. <HI>Di&s;&s;imulation</HI> was no better in Peter than it was in Judas; therefore Paul called it by it's proper name, to prevent others being en&s;nared thereby. Gal. 2. 13. Yet as one or two actions do not ordinari|ly form a man's character, David is far from having the character of &s;atan's &s;ervant, or Peter from having that of a hypocrite or a traitor. So let all take notice, that what I mean to appear again&s;t, is the particular evils that I have named, and not again&s;t the characters, or any of the vir|tues of tho&s;e who have been en&s;nared by them. Hence there is no need for any to take pains to prove that learned men, or good men have hold tho&s;e things; for that is not di&s;puted. The turn|ing points of our whole di&s;pute may be reduced to the&s;e four que&s;tions.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="148" REF="012655_0147_0F8BBED148AA79B0">
1. Whether Abraham's believing, and being ju&s;tified by the <HI>covenant of grace in Chri&s;t before</HI> he took the <HI>bond-woman,</HI> can give us warrant to confound that <HI>grace</HI> with the covenant of circum|ci&s;ion (which included the children both of the <HI>bond-woman</HI> and the <HI>free</HI>) &s;o as to bring the chil|dren of our <HI>fle&s;h</HI> to bapti&s;m, before we have any go&s;pel evidence that they are <HI>made free in Je&s;us Chri&s;t?</HI> Gal. 3.17, and 4.22&mdash;31.</P>
<P N="2">2. Since the chief advantage that the Jews had by the covenant of circumci&s;ion was, that unto them were committed the <HI>oracles of God;</HI> which were &s;o much limited to them, that be|fore Chri&s;t by his death had taken that covenant out of the way, his apo&s;tles might not preach to any but to them who were in it. Rom. 3.2. Mat. 10.5.6. Is it not an ab&s;olute fal&s;hood, for any to a&s;&s;ert, that the covenant is the &s;ame with our children, as it was with theirs? and &s;ince our children have the means for conver&s;ion u&s;ed with them, in &s;o much clearer light, than theirs had under the law; what an abu&s;e is it to accu&s;e us with le&s;&s;ening our children's privileges, only becau&s;e we dare not put the outward &s;ign of regeneration upon them, before we have evidence that the inward change is wrought?</P>
<P N="3">3. Though the primitive churches employ|ed elders in ordaining others over them, which doubtle&s;s is an example for us to follow; yet how can that prove, that the conferring of office-power is inherent in officers, and not in the church as a body, &s;ince Chri&s;t expre&s;sly warned his di&s;ci|ples, again&s;t having any &s;uch &s;uperiority among them as there is in civil <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, &s;aying, <HI>He that

<P N="4">4. Since in the Jewi&s;h church, where a cer|tain part or proportion of the peoples income, was by expre&s;s command to be given to the mini&s;ters of the &s;anctuary, while yet neither precept nor precedent can be found for rulers u&s;ing any <HI>force</HI> to collect it; what warrant can any earthly power have now, to a&s;&s;e&s;s any per&s;ons, and u&s;e force to collect the &s;ame, for the &s;upport of any religious wor&s;hip what&s;oever?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reader will not wonder that &s;uch care is taken to have this que&s;tion truly &s;tated, when he is informed, that &s;ince the&s;e &s;heets were in the pre&s;s, the author has &s;een a di&s;cour&s;e that bears &s;o &s;ine a title as this; <Q>Catholici&s;m: or, chri&s;tian charity,</Q> publi&s;hed at the particular reque&s;t of a <HI>convention</HI> of tho&s;e called &s;tanding mini&s;ters at Bri&s;tol, on <HI>May</HI> 20, 1772, in which the writer mentions our &s;epara|tion, which he calls a &s;ect well known, and &s;ays, <Q>It is worthy of notice, that many of the leaders of that unhap|py &s;chi&s;m, who were for pulling down mini&s;ters, and rip|ping up churches in their great zeal (rather fury) for &s;up|po&s;ed here&s;y, particularly in the article of giving and re|ceiving mini&s;terial &s;upport; I &s;ay many of tho&s;e very per&s;ons are as fond of &s;upport from their people, as tho&s;e they once anathematized. The con&s;i&s;tency and hone&s;ty of &s;uch a temper and conduct is far beyond me to recon|cile, and is, I apprehend, as irreconcilable as light and darkne&s;s.</Q> p. 38. Thus their charity prompts them to repre&s;ent us, as not only incon&s;i&s;tent, but al&s;o <HI>di&s;hone&s;t;</HI> and the way they take to do it, is by in&s;inuating that our contro|ver&s;y with them was about <HI>giving</HI> and <HI>receiving;</HI> whereas the truth is, it was about <HI>a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing</HI> and <HI>forcing;</HI> and they are welcome to produce one in&s;tance if they can of any &s;uch in|con&s;i&s;tency and di&s;hone&s;ty as they here &s;peak of, unle&s;s it be in two or three teachers who have de&s;erted the cau&s;e that they once profe&s;&s;ed to be in, in order to get into fellow&s;hip with the&s;e mini&s;ters. And &s;ince they have given this pam|phlet the name of <HI>charity,</HI> I would ju&s;t remark that they &s;ay, <Q>There is doubtle&s;s a &s;ort of natural, as well as chri&s;tian charity. The &s;ource of this kind of charity is &s;elf; here it begins and ends.</Q> p. 25. and they &s;ay, <Q>Liberty and candor are the great ba&s;is of human happine&s;s: we often hear per&s;ons extolling the advantages of both, who yet &s;eem to be really acquainted with neither. For if they have any de&s;ign on foot, if you entertain different views, and with freedom &s;peak your mind, you are in&s;tantly deemed an enemy, and you mu&s;t be treated as &s;uch, &s;o that if you e&s;cape without the &s;word, it is not &s;o much owing to a generous &s;pirit of liberty, as a want of power.</Q> p. 65.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now the reader may form &s;ome judgment of what &s;ort of per&s;ons they are, who extol liberty, charity and a catholic temper, while their own charity begins and ends in <HI>&s;elf,</HI> by the two following notes. Speaking of our &s;eparation the writer &s;ays, <Q>Such uncharitable principles have led them to exclude them&s;elves from the communion of THE ca|tholic church.</Q> p. 38. And &s;peaking of occa&s;ionally in|viting mini&s;ters to preach he &s;ays, <Q>I cannot &s;ee the pro|priety nor the expediency of inviting the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of ANY man, be his profe&s;&s;ion what it may, that denies ME the rights and privileges of the church of Chri&s;t.

If any can fairly an&s;wer the&s;e que&s;tions; or can &s;hew that this is not the true &s;tate of our contro|ver&s;y, they will do &s;omething to the purpo&s;e: but to neglect this and fill up volume after volume with other things, evidently tends to confu&s;ion and not to peace.
