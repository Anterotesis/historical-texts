<HEAD>THE YEARLY VERSES Of the PRINTERS Lad, who carrieth a|bout the <HI>Penn&s;ylva|nia GAZETTE,</HI> to the Cu&s;tomers thereof. <DATE>JANUARY 1. 1740.</DATE></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>BY annual Services E&s;tates are held,</L>
<L>The Rent unpaid the Tenant is expell'd:</L>
<L>And I, &s;ubjected by my Tenure, pay</L>
<L>A new &s;truck Li&s;t of Rhymes on <HI>New-Year</HI>'s Day.</L>
<L>Sure, if I mi&s;s, to have an empty Pur&s;e,</L>
<L>And to di&s;plea&s;e my MASTER'S, which is wor&s;e,</L>
<L>But never was I puzzled heretofore,</L>
<L>So much the la&s;t Year's News to number o'er:</L>
<L>I'm out of Sorts, and know not what to write;</L>
<L>The War's begun with <HI>Spain.</HI>&mdash;but who will fight?</L>
<L>Unfitted for this Ta&s;k, a Tale I'll tell,</L>
<L>In Hopes the Sub&s;titute may do as well.</L>
<L>Two loving Neighbours, but unlike in Sen&s;e;</L>
<L>(For one rely'd alone on Providence)</L>
<L>Re&s;olv'd, the fir&s;t, his Hou&s;hold to &s;ecure,</L>
<L>By Arms prepar'd, and Locks on ev'ry Door;</L>
<L>Th' other ne'er to be upon his Watch,</L>
<L>But 'gain&s;t Temptations, and his Doors to latch,</L>
<L>To keep out Winds and Rain, or Dogs and Swine;</L>
<L>From Thieves defended by a Fence divine.</L>
<L>Oft' had the&s;e Neighbours been in deep Di&s;pute,</L>
<L>But neither could the Other yet confute:</L>
<L>The fir&s;t then thinking how with hone&s;t Guile</L>
<L>He could his Friend to Rea&s;on reconcile,</L>
<L>Goes in the Dead of Night, his Pewter takes,</L>
<L>And Prize of all his loo&s;e laid Trea&s;ure makes.</L>
<L>The Lo&s;er in the Morn perceives his Lo&s;s,</L>
<L>Reflects full &s;orely, on &s;o great a Cro&s;s;</L>
<L>Refu&s;es Meat, grows thin; his Looks are pale;</L>
<L>And loud he would, but dur&s;t not loud bewail:</L>
<L>His Neighbour &s;aw, and pitying did re&s;tore</L>
<L>The Goods purloin'd, and bade him bolt his Door.</L>
<L>But he &s;till thinking Providence was near,</L>
<L>That try'd his Faith by &s;uch a &s;imple Fear,</L>
<L>Re&s;olv'd more firmly to rely on him,</L>
<L>And more and more to merit his E&s;teem.</L>
<L>Not long, alas! he liv'd in this Re&s;olve,</L>
<L>Sea&s;ons and Things in Motion quick revolve;</L>
<L>Thieves de&s;p'rate, came within the Neighbourhood;</L>
<L>They try'd a Hou&s;e, and there the Bars with&s;tood;</L>
<L>They came to this (and here a Latch was all)</L>
<L>An Entrance gain'd to Kitchen and to Hall;</L>
<L>And rifled ev'ry Place, and left him Poor,</L>
<L>Who thought him&s;elf in Providence &s;ecure.</L>
<L>Thus mi&s;erable grown, he &s;ought his Friend;</L>
<L>Have you &s;aid he contriv'd to &s;peed my End;</L>
<L>I'm robb'd of ev'ry u&s;eful valu'd Thing,</L>
<L>Except my Bed, which no Repo&s;e can bring.</L>
<L>Quoth he, what I can &s;pare I will be&s;tow</L>
<L>To help your Need, but not to make you owe;</L>
<L>To me this dire Misfortune is not due,</L>
<L>I once for Caution kindly cozen'd you;</L>
<L>The Warning mi&s;s'd its Aim, yet I'm your Friend,</L>
<L>And would your Thinking with your Living mend:</L>
<L>What Virtue or good Rea&s;on can there be</L>
<L>In baiting Hooks for Vice and Robbery?</L>
<L>As Pre&s;ervation is our elde&s;t Law,</L>
<L>In which the Wi&s;e have yet ob&s;erv'd no Flaw,</L>
<L>It well becomes us to &s;ecure our own,</L>
<L>While we thereby do Injury to none.</L>
<L>Can Providence be pleas'd to &s;ee us lay</L>
<L>The Fruits of Labour to be &s;tole away?</L>
<L>If at my Face a Rogue &s;hould clench his Fi&s;t,</L>
<L>Is it Religion if I don't re&s;i&s;t?</L>
<L>Believe me Friend 'tis not&mdash;nor God we &s;erve,</L>
<L>By feeding Villains while our &s;elves may &s;tarve.</L>
<L>An hone&s;t Indu&s;try becomes a Man,</L>
<L>And to pre&s;erve his Freedom if he can;</L>
<L>But if with all his prudent Care he fails</L>
<L>The la&s;t Great Day mu&s;t equipoi&s;e the Scales.</L>
