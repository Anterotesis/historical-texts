<HEAD>A <HI>Third LETTER</HI> From a Mini&s;ter of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> TO THE DISSENTERS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Told you in the Clo&s;e of my <HI>Second Letter,</HI> that if Mr. <HI>G.</HI> thought fit to write again, and would &s;eriou&s;ly and fairly attend to the real Merits of the Cau&s;e, I would willingly attend him a|gain; but if he was re&s;olved to go on Scoffing and Reviling, I &s;hould endeavour to find &s;ome better Method of &s;pending my Time, than to take any further Notice of him: Accor|dingly in hopes, I &s;uppo&s;e, that I would have done with him, and being re&s;olved to have the
<PB N="2" REF="004148_0004_1003B93C9F48BE48">
la&s;t Word; he has cho&s;e not only to go on in his reviling Method, but has, if po&s;&s;ible, gone a much further Length in his injurious and abu|&s;ive Manner of treating us than he did before.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not therefore think it worth my while to write any particular and di&s;tinct Reply to his Remarks; not becau&s;e there would be any man|ner of Difficulty in confuting every Syllable of them; but becau&s;e there is &s;carce any thing new of Rea&s;oning in them, (nothing indeed worth men|tioning but what is &s;ufficiently confuted already, in the very Letter which he pretends to an&s;wer;) and becau&s;e the pur&s;uing &s;uch a bitter, reflecting, bantering, uncharitable Di&s;pute as he has gone into, in the manner it de&s;erves, may rather tend to increa&s;e than mitigate that unchri&s;tian Tem|per in you towards us, which his Management of the Controver&s;y has a &s;ad Tendency to pro|mote, and which therefore I &s;hould rather in|cline to draw a Veil over than to expo&s;e. For it is indeed a mo&s;t melancholy thing in the Eyes of all &s;erious Chri&s;tians, that one who profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel of Peace, &s;hould, at all adventures, give him&s;elf up in &s;uch an a|bandoned Manner to excite among Chri&s;tians a mortal Hatred and Aver&s;ion one towards ano|ther.</P>
<P>He &s;ays, p. 1. <HI>It hath been ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, that &s;uch as lie in wait to deceive, make it their fir&s;t work to move the Pa&s;&s;ions of their Readers and Hearers.</HI> In which Words he hath unhappily de&s;cribed his own Character and Practice; for I appeal to you all that read his Book, (which I believe will be but few,) whether he hath aimed at much el&s;e
<PB N="3" REF="004148_0005_1003DCD9F6900480">
than to rai&s;e and enflame the Pa&s;&s;ions of his Rea|ders, and tho&s;e of the wor&s;t Sort, even the Pa&s;|&s;ions of Anger, Malice, Hatred, Contempt and Ill-will, than which nothing can be more &s;can|dalous to Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>But tho' I do not de&s;ign any particular An&s;wer to this new Scold of his, yet in Compa&s;&s;ion to &s;ome who may otherwi&s;e be mi&s;led and impo&s;ed upon by certain bold A&s;&s;ertions and artful In&s;i|nuations, I have, tho' very much again&s;t my own Inclinations, been prevailed upon to make a few <HI>Ob&s;ervations</HI> upon his <HI>Remarks,</HI> chiefly with Re|gard to certain pretended Facts, which are as directly contrary to Truth as Darkne&s;s is to Light.&mdash;</P>
<P>And,</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> thing I &s;hall take Notice of is, p. 85, 87. wherein he a&s;&s;erts, that <HI>I confe&s;s &s;ome things are unlawful in the Church of</HI> England: Now as to this I de&s;ire you to read that Pa&s;&s;age in my <HI>Second Letter,</HI> p. 46 and &s;ee with your own Eyes, which will &s;oon convince you how far Mr. <HI>G.</HI> is from the lea&s;t Regard to Truth: for you will then be &s;en&s;ible that there is not the lea&s;t Ground for that A&s;&s;ertion. Read al&s;o p. 33. and fir&s;t Letter p. 13. where I challenge him and all the World to prove that there is any thing unlaw|ful in our Church, and p. 35. and many other Places there are to the &s;ame Effect. &mdash; I allow indeed that unlawful things impo&s;ed would be a ju&s;tifiable Rea&s;on of Separation; but I am far from &s;aying or thinking, and as far is he from proving, that there is any &s;uch thing in our Church: And when I &s;ay, <HI>that was our Ca&s;e:</HI> he
<PB N="4" REF="004148_0006_1003B944133F3B18">
can't but know, I mean (not that any thing is un|lawful in the Church, but,) only that &s;ome nece&s;|&s;ary things were wanting among you which were a ju&s;tifiable Rea&s;on for our leaving you.</P>
<P N="2">2. In p. 5. He calls <HI>Bohun</HI> an <HI>hone&s;t Man</HI> and &s;ays <HI>he is informed he is of our Communion.</HI> &mdash; Now it is certain he can't be an hone&s;t Man, becau&s;e he mu&s;t know that he &s;peaks fal&s;e in &s;aying, that <Q><HI>Our Bi&s;hops give Licences to Midwives to Baptize, and to Men to have two Wives, and to commit Adul|tery and practice Knavery</HI></Q> &amp;c. &mdash; And I have it from a Gentleman of great Character and Ho|nour in <HI>London,</HI> that he is reputed an Infidel, and con&s;equently of no Communion: &mdash; And when I find fault with &s;ome of your Mini&s;ters for re|commending and &s;cattering about that, and o|thers the like abu&s;ive Books, he knows I don't mean the whole Body of them; for I know, and he may know that there are many of them that do abhor &s;uch Books, and his own among the re&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. He charges me, in p. 6. with <HI>reflecting on the Father of Spirits,</HI> becau&s;e I &s;ay, <Q>He that is not convinced by the mighty Rea&s;oning of <HI>Hooker</HI> and <HI>Chillingworth</HI> appears to me to have a Mind of a very odd make.</Q> &mdash; Now as to this, he knows I am far from thinking that God made his Mind &s;o oddly who is not convinced, and that what I mean is, that it &s;eems to me he mu&s;t, by perver&s;ly indulging his Prejudices, have made him&s;elf ob&s;tinate and impregnable again&s;t con|viction: &mdash; It is not God that make Men per|ver&s;e, but they make them&s;elves &s;o</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="5" REF="004148_0007_1003DCE21CC353B8">4. In p 7. He does in effect charge me with <HI>barefaced wilful Perjury,</HI> becau&s;e I &s;aid "God is my Witne&s;s and you al&s;o, that he had charged me fal&s;ly in &s;aying, <HI>I had repeatedly railed again&s;t you either from the Pre&s;s or Pulpit.</HI> &mdash; Now as to this, I am content to leave it to your own Con|&s;ciences, and &s;till appeal to you all that have e|ver known my manner of Life, whether any thing has ever been my Practice that could ju&s;tly be charged with Railing? and con&s;equently, Whe|ther his dreadful charging me at this Rate be not un&s;upportably abu&s;ive?</P>
<P N="5">5. In p. <HI>ibid.</HI> He &s;ays, I charge him <HI>with exce&s;|&s;ive Rioting,</HI> as tho' I meant Drinking; when he knows I meant, not Drinking exce&s;&s;ively, but another Sort of Riot, even that of malevolent Pa&s;&s;ions and Evil-&s;peaking, which you all know to be true. &mdash; And on this Occa&s;ion he in&s;i|nuates as if I were at the head of <HI>Bonfires and drinking &s;trong Drink</HI> on the Evening of Gun-powder Trea&s;on; when you all know that I never had any Concern in tho&s;e Diver&s;ions, and that there were at lea&s;t five of you to one of my People that were pre&s;ent on tho&s;e Occa&s;ions, when I cannot under&s;tand there ever pa&s;&s;ed any thing but what was very innocent.</P>
<P N="6">6. In p. 9. He denys that he repre&s;ented the Church of <HI>England</HI> in that odious and&punc; abu&s;ive manner I mentioned, calling <HI>it not Chri&s;t's Church but the Devil's.</HI> &mdash; Now you all know that e|ver read them, that he meant the Church in tho&s;e Ver&s;es: And I have them to &s;hew in his own hand-writing, and I dare appeal to you all
<PB N="6" REF="004148_0008_1003B94960CC4938">
whether they can admit of any other Con&s;truc|tion, and to his own Con&s;cience, both that he was the Author of them, and that this was his meaning.</P>
<P N="7">7 In p 10 He <HI>challenges all Mankind</HI> to <HI>&s;hew any thing whereby he ever di&s;covered the lea&s;t Di&s;po|&s;ition or Inclination to conform to the Engli&s;h Modes of Wor&s;hip and Government.</HI> &mdash; Now as to this I have a Letter by me in his own hand-writing, that I am ready to &s;hew you at any Time, which he wrote for one of his Pari&s;hioners to a Gentleman in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> wherein, with all the good Wi&s;hes imaginable for the Churches Pro&s;perity <HI>and Succe&s;s in this Land,</HI> that Gentleman is de&s;ired to &s;end <HI>the be&s;t Books in Defence of the Wor&s;hip and Government of the Church of</HI> England.&mdash;Now I ap|peal to you all whether the Writer of that Letter had not &s;trong Inclinations to Conformity: tho' we are very thankful that he never did actually conform, &s;ince he appears to be a Per&s;on of &s;uch a virulent Temper.</P>
<P N="8">8. In p. 12. He &s;ays <HI>I encouraged a Per&s;on to preach every Sabbath Day,</HI> who confe&s;&s;edly <HI>had no Power.</HI> &mdash; Now as to this it is far from being true: And that very Gentleman him&s;elf told the Per&s;on who in&s;pected the Pre&s;s, upon his Inqui|ry into this Matter, that I never directed or en|couraged him to preach&punc; and it is very &s;trange that he would let it pa&s;s when he knew it to be not true: Nor did I ever direct him or any one el&s;e to do any thing be&s;ides what a meer Lay|man might do, and what the Society that &s;ent me hither, both approves and rewards. &mdash; As
<PB N="7" REF="004148_0009_1003DCEE052E2C00">
to what Mr. G. him&s;elf did, I a&s;&s;ure you I had it from one of your own Mini&s;ters who condemned his Proceeding&punc; as being generally e&s;teemed ve|ry irregular and incon&s;i&s;tent with your Con&s;ti|tution.</P>
<P N="9">9. He &s;ays, p. 15. That <HI>one of your Mini&s;ters did undertake to defend his Remarks, and did it &s;o rourdly that I had little to &s;ay;</HI> and that <HI>I declared, that it is not Epi&s;copal Ordination I &s;tand &s;o much upon, and that if I were a Dioce&s;an I &s;hould not oblige any that had Presbyterian Ordination to be re-ordained.</HI> Now as to the&s;e Articles there is no truth at all in either of them; and I appeal to all that were pre&s;ent at that Conver&s;ation, (and there were &s;everal of both Per&s;ua&s;ions,) that that Gentleman being once and again urged to defend him, he utterly declined it, and &s;aid <HI>he had no Bu&s;ine&s;s to defend Mr.</HI> G<HI>'s Notions,</HI> or to this Effect. &mdash; And the Gentleman him&s;elf has &s;ince declared to me before &s;undry Evidences, that he never re|ported me as giving up Epi&s;copal Ordination, or &s;aying were I a Dioce&s;an, I would not in&s;i&s;t on Reordination: So that Mr. <HI>G.</HI> is left alone to &s;tand the Author of the&s;e notorious Untruths.</P>
<P N="10">10 On this Occa&s;ion he &s;ays once and again, p. 86. That <HI>he is well &s;atisfied we never had Epi&s;|copal Ordination.</HI> &mdash; Now this is very &s;trange indeed, for when he di&s;puted once with one of our Brethren on this Subject before &s;everal Peo|ple, that Gentleman, to convict him, &s;hewed him his Letters of Orders with the Bi&s;hop's Hand and Seal, and he owned it was &s;o: How then can he now &s;ay he is well &s;atisfied of the contrary, when
<PB N="8" REF="004148_0010_1003DCF709AD4B80">
he knows otherwi&s;e? &mdash; And becau&s;e you are made to believe we never were ordained by the Bi&s;hop with Impo&s;ition of Hands, &amp;c. I do now for your Satisfaction &s;olemnly declare, that we were, and are ready to &s;hew our Letters of Or|dination at any time; and moreover, that the Bi&s;hops of <HI>England</HI> make no Account at all of the Ordinations we had before.</P>
<P N="11">11. After all that I &s;aid in Vindication of our Di&s;cipline, it is really amazing that he &s;hould go on in repre&s;enting things in that utterly wrong and injurious manner he does in Pages 26 to 29, and then conclude by &s;aying that we <HI>dur&s;t not refu&s;e the Sacrament to the mo&s;t openly vi|cious Per&s;on that belongs to our Communion, if there were any &s;piritual Court at hand;</HI> when he knows, and I told you from the expre&s;s Words of the Prayer-Book, that we are <HI>expre&s;ly ordered to refu&s;e the Sacrament to all &s;uch, till they openly declare their Repentance:</HI> And this is our con&s;tant Prac|tice &mdash; And as to the ancient Di&s;cipline which we lament the Want of, it is as much wanting with you, as with us; for pray what open Penance is done among you in Lent? which alone is the Di&s;cipline the Church means, as I &s;hewed you before.</P>
<P N="12">12. In p 38, concerning the barbarous Mur|ther of Arch-bi&s;hop <HI>Sharp,</HI> which it never was doubted but that it was committed by Presbyte|rians, and it is expre&s;ly a&s;&s;erted by the Author that continues Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI>'s Hi&s;tory, Vol. 4 p 150) I &s;ay, concerning this Murther Mr. <HI>G.</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Whoever did it, the Fact is ju&s;tifiable on the
<PB N="9" REF="004148_0011_1003DCFA28678180">
&s;ame foot that</HI> Phineas <HI>was ju&s;tified in killing</HI> Zimri <HI>and</HI> Cosbi. &mdash; O prodigious! &mdash; Shall an Example of Zeal in&s;pired by God him&s;elf in ex|ecuting his Vengeance upon the vile&s;t Idolatry and Lewdne&s;s, be alledged to ju&s;tifie a barbarous Murther? At this Rate every wild Enthu&s;ia&s;t that has the Malice and Rage to prompt him to it, and the Madne&s;s to conceit him&s;elf in&s;pired in doing it, may be ju&s;tified in committing what Murthers he plea&s;es on every one that he con|ceits to be in a wrong way? He may plead the Example of <HI>Phineas</HI> as Mr. <HI>G.</HI> does, and all is right. What does this tend to, but to open a Door to all manner of Violence, to the mo&s;t ex|ecrable Murthers, and inhuman Butcheries ima|ginable? Upon this Principle who could think his Life &s;afe? And what Mi&s;chief might one not look for from the Hands of one that would talk at this a&s;toni&s;hing Rate?</P>
<P N="13">13. In <HI>p.</HI> 41. He &s;ays, <HI>The fir&s;t Reformers took the Prayers of the Church out of the Popi&s;h Ma&s;s-Book.</HI> Now in this there is a mo&s;t wretched De|lu&s;ion; for the Truth of the Matter is this: Our Reformers had no Regard at all to the Popi&s;h Books as &s;uch, but to the Holy Scriptures, and the ancient Liturgies of the primitive Church, which were u&s;ed long before the Times of Po|pery, from whence &s;ome Forms of Prayer had been continued down through the corrupt Times of Popery; but &s;urely they were never the wor&s;e for having been u&s;ed by the Papi&s;ts, any more than the P&s;alms, the Scripture-Le&s;&s;ons, the Lord's-Prayer, the Creed and the Ten Command|ments: The Papi&s;ts have done no harm to the
<PB N="10" REF="004148_0012_1003B95700DEEE50">
P&s;alms and Le&s;&s;ons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by u&s;ing them; neither for the &s;ame Rea&s;on could any of tho&s;e ancient Prayers be the le&s;s excellent and u&s;eful becau&s;e they had been u&s;ed by them: And be&s;ides the&s;e a great Part of the Prayers of our Church were compo&s;ed by tho&s;e holy Martyrs and Confe&s;&s;ors them&s;elves: For this &s;ee <HI>Sparrow, Comber</HI> and <HI>Wheatly</HI> on the Common-Prayer, which I will any Time &s;hew you.</P>
<P N="14">14. On this Occa&s;ion, I ob&s;erve <HI>p.</HI> 99. he &s;ays, That <HI>in the fir&s;t</HI> 300 <HI>Years there were no &s;tinted Li|turgies.</HI> &mdash; Now nothing more untrue than this can be a&s;&s;erted; for I can &s;hew you in Mr. <HI>Bing|ham's Origines,</HI> the very Forms taken from the <HI>Apo&s;tolical Con&s;titutions,</HI> which are &s;uppo&s;ed by him, and Bp. <HI>Beveridge,</HI> and other learned Men, to be a Collection of the Rules and Practices that were generally in u&s;e within the Three fir&s;t Cen|turies in the Ea&s;tern Church; and that many of them were, Mr. <HI>Bingham</HI> proves beyond all con|tradiction from St. <HI>Cyprian</HI> and others of the Fa|thers. St. <HI>Cyprian</HI> &s;ays, <HI>They had one publick and common Prayer, De Orat. Dom.</HI> And he lived with|in 150 Years of the Apo&s;tles. And <HI>Ignatius</HI> who wrote within 7 Years of St. <HI>John</HI>'s Time, <HI>Ep. ad Magn.</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Come all together to the &s;ame Prayer, let there be one Common Prayer,</HI> &amp;c. Now &s;eve|ral of the&s;e ancient Forms are the &s;ame with ours. It is pity but that you &s;hould &s;ee the&s;e Things in Mr. <HI>Bingham,</HI> and particularly I would have you compare and &s;ee the Difference between the Po|pi&s;h Forms and ours, which he would have you believe the &s;ame, and which I am ready to &s;hew you: you would then &s;ee how little Truth there is in him.</P>
<P N="15"><PB N="11" REF="004148_0013_1003DD0B4424F578">15. He &s;till goes on &s;aying, <HI>p.</HI> 99. that the <HI>Extempore</HI> or <HI>free</HI> Way of Prayer, (as he calls it,) <HI>is the ancient approved Scripture Way,</HI> and he <HI>cannot find in Scripture that any one Per&s;on ever u&s;ed Forms compo&s;ed by another.</HI>&mdash;Now as to this, I &s;till chal|lenge him to &s;hew one Precept or Example in Scripture for <HI>Extempore</HI> Prayers in publick Wor|&s;hip: And it is plain as I &s;hewed you, that Chri&s;t u&s;ed <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 22.1. on the Cro&s;s; and <HI>Acts</HI> 4.24. the Apo&s;tles u&s;ed a Pa&s;&s;age out of the 2d <HI>P&s;alm;</HI> and the P&s;alms which were Forms compo&s;ed by <HI>David</HI> and others, are expre&s;ly required by St. <HI>Paul</HI> to be u&s;ed in Chri&s;tian A&s;&s;emblies, <HI>Eph.</HI> 5.19. and <HI>Col.</HI> 3.16.</P>
<P N="16">16. In order to &s;hew the unlawfulne&s;s of Au|thority's interpo&s;ing in indifferent Things&punc; he undertakes to &s;hew, <HI>p</HI> 70 that <HI>there are no human Actions that are indifferent</HI> &mdash; Whereas nothing is clearer both from the Nature of Things, and in the Sen&s;e of all Divines of any Note, than that &s;ome human Actions are indifferent; and it is evident that to deny lawful Authority a right to interpo&s;e with re&s;pect to &s;uch Things for the publick Good, does manife&s;tly de&s;troy all hu|man Government, in Familys, Church and State.&mdash;When our Saviour &s;ays, (<HI>Matth.</HI> 12.36.) we mu&s;t <HI>give an Account of every idle Word,</HI> it is plain he means not every <HI>indifferent Word;</HI> but every <HI>fal&s;e, vain or ra&s;h Word,</HI> as Dr. <HI>Ham|mond</HI> on the Place, clearly proves.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> On this Subject he has here a deal of idle, unintelligible Talk for 20 Pages together, which &s;o far as you can make any Sen&s;e of it, you will
<PB N="12" REF="004148_0014_1003DD0DCFBD6F28">
find fully an&s;wered already in my 2d Letter in the Places he refers to, and that he takes little or no Notice of it, any otherwi&s;e than to mi&s;re|pre&s;ent it: I mu&s;t therefore de&s;ire you to read it over carefully again, particularly <HI>p.</HI> 38.</P>
<P N="17">17. But there is one Thing here, I can't but take Notice of; and that is, <HI>p.</HI> 75, where he &s;ays, <HI>I rob every Man of his own per&s;onal Judgment of Di&s;|cretion;</HI> and that I teach that <HI>when lawful Autho|rity has interpo&s;ed, every one mu&s;t &s;acrifice the Peace of his Con&s;cience to the Peace of the Church.</HI> &mdash; Now this is mo&s;t notoriou&s;ly fal&s;e, for it is di|rectly contrary to what I did teach you in my <HI>Second Letter, P.</HI> 40. My Words are, "<HI>You will &s;ay, What, May we not judge for our &s;elves? I an|&s;wer, Yes, We not only may, but ought to judge for our &s;elves, and &s;ee to it, that there be nothing required of us by Authority that is evidently contrary to the Word of God.</HI> &mdash; And he knows that it is not any deliberate rea&s;onable &s;etled Judgment of Con&s;cience, much le&s;s Peace of Con&s;cience, that I hold it our Duty to &s;acrifice to the public Peace, but only <HI>little Doubts and Scruples</HI> about Things of &s;mall moment, as I abundantly &s;hew, <HI>P.</HI> 41, 42. And in this all good Ca&s;ui&s;ts agree. <HI>See</HI> A. Bp. Sharp's <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e of Con&s;cience.</HI></P>
<P N="18">18. I told you that we are not obliged to read one Syllable of the <HI>Apocrypha</HI> on the Lord's-Day. &mdash;To this he mo&s;t fal&s;ly &s;ays, (tho' he pretends to have the Calender open before him) <HI>That there is no Provi&s;ion made that Apocryphal Le&s;|&s;ons may not be read on the Lord's-Day,</HI> P. 89. Than which nothing can be &s;aid more contrary to

Truth; for there are other Le&s;&s;ons appointed for every Sunday in the Year, as he might have &s;een if he would have opened his Eyes. A Man might as well look up to the Meridian at Noon in a clear Day, and at the &s;ame Time in&s;i&s;t on it that the Sun don't &s;hine. &mdash; And here he &s;ays I would have you believe that we read none but <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;ticus;</HI> whereas I never aimed at any &s;uch thing, but only mentioned them as &s;uch Parts as we do read, not that we read no other.</P>
<P>But there is no End of ob&s;erving to you the many gro&s;s Untruths and injurious Mi&s;repre&s;en|tations of both the Church and me that abound throughout his Pamphlet: I might &s;oon collect an hundred at lea&s;t, and it would be very ea&s;y to confute them all; but you may readily &s;ee, from tho&s;e that I have taken notice of, what Judgment to make of the re&s;t, and how little Cre|dit is to be given him in any thing that he &s;ays. The Truth is, and I am &s;orry I am obliged to &s;ay it, that of all the Writers of Controver&s;y I ever read, (and I have read a great many) I ne|ver found one &s;o full of Rancour, &s;o di&s;ingenuous, or that had &s;o little Regard to the Truth and Right of Things as this Man: He little cares what he &s;ays, &s;o that he may but throw Dirt, and rai&s;e an Odium, and ca&s;t a Contempt on his An|tagoni&s;t, and bring Hatred and Ill-will upon us: And I do again heartily pray God to give him Repentance and Forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P>One thing however I mu&s;t further take Notice of, and that is relating to the Prede&s;tinarian Controver&s;y, p. 123. where he &s;ays that <HI>the very
<PB N="14" REF="004148_0016_1003DD1C5AF419C8">
Doctrine which I deny,</HI> i. e. ab&s;olute per&s;onal Pre|de&s;tination, <HI>is the Doctrine of all the foreign reformed Churches, and even of the univer&s;al Church of Chri&s;t.</HI>&mdash; Whereas he can't but know that it is only <HI>Cal|vin</HI>'s Part of the Reformation that ever taught this Doctrine, and tho&s;e that follow him, and that <HI>Luther</HI> &amp; <HI>Melancthon</HI> and the Churches that they reformed, which were by far the greater Number, ever di&s;claimed it, except a few rigid People among them; and the <HI>Augu&s;tan</HI> or <HI>Aus|burg</HI> Confe&s;&s;ion, which is the Summary of <HI>Luther</HI>'s Doctrine, and which was received by his Part of the Reformation, has none of this Doctrine in it, but what is indeed incon&s;i&s;tent with it: Now this Confe&s;&s;ion is generally received in the whole Kingdoms of <HI>Denmark, Norway, Sweden,</HI> and <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> in &s;ome Parts of <HI>Poland,</HI> and all the Prote&s;tant Churches of the <HI>High Germany,</HI> and the Doctrine taught in all the&s;e Churches, accord|ing to <HI>Luther</HI> and <HI>Melancthon</HI> is, That <HI>God decreed to elect to Eternal Life tho&s;e who he fore&s;aw would &s;o co-operate with his Grace as effectually to repent, be|lieve and per&s;evere in Well-doing, and to reject tho&s;e who he fore&s;aw would abide impenitent in their Sins.</HI> (vid <HI>Apell. Evang.</HI> cap. 4.) And this is the &s;ame with St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s and ours, not to mention the whole Greek Church, comprehending a va&s;t Body of Chri&s;tians, and this is agreeable to the Doc|trine of all the Fathers, and the univer&s;al Church of Chri&s;t in its pure&s;t Times, the fir&s;t 300 Years, both Ea&s;tern and We&s;tern; and I challenge him to &s;hew any of the ancient Writers of the Pri|mitive Church, of any Note, down to the Days of St. <HI>Augu&s;tin,</HI> that ever taught the Doctrine of ab&s;olute per&s;onal Decrees. &mdash; As to what he quotes from the 9th of <HI>Romans,</HI> it relates not to
<PB N="15" REF="004148_0017_1003DD27A1BF09C0">
the eternal State of particular Per&s;ons, but to the Election or Rejection of whole Nations and Peo|ple in this World, whereby they become or cea&s;e to be the peculiar Covenant People of God, as will plainly appear if you carefully attend to the Scope and De&s;ign of the Apo&s;tle's Rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>In p. 126. He &s;ays he <HI>hopes all he has &s;aid fully proves that the Doctrine of ab&s;olute Prede&s;tination is really the Doctrine of the Church of</HI> England. &mdash; I an&s;wer, very far from it: all that he has proved is, that a few private Men or particular Divines of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> in the latter End of Q. <HI>Eli&s;abeth</HI>'s Reign, and &s;ome part of that of K. <HI>James</HI> the <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> were of that Opinion; and pray, who ever denied it? On the other hand, for the&s;e, (taking in the whole, both at the Time of the fir&s;t Reformation, as I &s;hewed before, and ever &s;ince) there have been, I believe I may &s;ay, at lea&s;t fifty to one of the contrary Opinion, who were neverthele&s;s as true Churchmen as the others; for neither the one, nor the other of the&s;e Opi|nions were ever yet impo&s;ed in our Church, as Terms either of Communion or Ordination. &mdash; There was indeed, as I allowed, a &s;trong Party towards the End of Q. <HI>Eli&s;abeth</HI>'s Reign, who laboured hard to get the <HI>Lambeth</HI> Articles impo|&s;ed, but were reprimanded for it, and the Impo|&s;ition of them never could be obtained, nor were they ever allowed to be the Doctrine of our Church. And happy it was for us that they could not gain their Ends, for had they been e|&s;tabli&s;hed they would have created &s;uch Di&s;&s;en|tion and Confu&s;ion as would have &s;oon broken the Church in pieces.&mdash;For all the&s;e things and many more, let me again beg of you to read Dr.

<P>Indeed Mr. <HI>G.</HI> endeavours to invalidate the Authority of Dr. <HI>Heylin,</HI> p. 42. from the Te&s;ti|mony of Mr. <HI>Pierce,</HI> who &s;ays <HI>He was an Author that had no Regard to Truth.</HI> But in An&s;wer to this, I would recommend to you the learned Dr. <HI>Grey,</HI> who in his An&s;wer to <HI>Peirce,</HI> (who, by the way, was an abandoned <HI>Arian,</HI>) does abundantly prove in multitudes of In&s;tances, that <HI>he had no Regard to Truth:</HI> And in reading this Book, which you may have of me, you will find a full An|&s;wer to every thing that Mr. <HI>G.</HI> here writes a|gain&s;t me, which he has, in a great mea&s;ure col|lected from the writings of this Mr. <HI>Pierce</HI> whom Dr. <HI>Grey</HI> an&s;wers: There you will find the Sto|ries of <HI>Heath</HI> and <HI>Cummin</HI> abundantly confirmed, p. 32 from <HI>Strype</HI>'s Life of A. Bp. <HI>Parker,</HI> p. 244. &mdash; Read al&s;o Dr <HI>Grey</HI>'s and Dr. <HI>Maddox</HI>'s An|&s;wers to Mr. <HI>Neal</HI>'s <HI>Hi&s;tory of the Puritans,</HI> who do abundantly convict him and Mr. <HI>Pierce</HI> of many gro&s;s and notorious Untruths: And I challenge Mr. <HI>G.</HI> to &s;hew any In&s;tances wherein the&s;e Gen|tlemen, or Dr. <HI>Heylin</HI> either, have mi&s;repre&s;en|ted things: No, they never were, and never will be an&s;wered.</P>
<P>And now to conclude, Let me be&s;eech you in faithfulne&s;s to Truth, to God and your own Souls, to examine carefully both Sides of the Que&s;tion, and particularly I beg you will &s;o far do me Ju&s;tice, as to read over faithfully my <HI>Se|cond Letter,</HI> together with his pretended An&s;wer to it, and then you will &s;ee how far it is from

That <HI>he has gone through the principal Pa&s;&s;ages, and has not &s;ilently pa&s;&s;ed by any thing worthy of Re|mark.</HI> &mdash; Whereas, if you compare them exactly together, you will find that he has pa&s;&s;ed by the greate&s;t Part, and things of the greate&s;t Weight and Moment, and that where he does remark, his Remarks mainly con&s;i&s;t in &s;coffing and revi|ling Language, and where he pretends to rea&s;on, his way is fir&s;t mo&s;t abu&s;ively to mi&s;repre&s;ent me, and then to fight in the Air with his own Sha|dow, and in a Du&s;t of his own rai&s;ing: otherwi&s;e there is nothing new, but the &s;ame things over and over again, which have been an&s;wered a thou&s;and times, and (as I &s;aid) even in the Let|ter he pretends to confute, to which therefore as being yet &s;afe and &s;ound I will refer you, in|treating you to con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly how poor an Account you will be able to give of your Read|ing and Inquiry, if you do not candidly and im|partially read on both &s;ides, and procure all the helps that are offered you for your Information, and if you do not lay a&s;ide all party Affections, and &s;eek after Truth and Right for their own Sakes, and that you may know and do the Will of God, and be &s;aved.</P>

You &s;ee from what I have here laid before you how little Regard is due to any thing he &s;ays: Let him then, if he plea&s;es, go on Scribbling, Reviling and Scolding to the End of his Life: &mdash; This I am &s;ure of, he will never be able to prove that ours is an unlawful, or un&s;afe

However, I would wi&s;h him to con&s;ider what a &s;ad thing it would be for him when he has &s;pent his Life in this furious manner, to go into the other World enflamed and reaking hot with &s;uch a bitter, un|charitable &amp; revengeful Spirit as you &s;ee his Wri|tings do every where abound with, which I do mo&s;t heartily compa&s;&s;ionate, and I pray God to calm his Pa&s;&s;ions and recover him to a truly Chri&s;tian Temper of Mind before it be too late!
