<HEAD>THE Mechanick's ADDRESS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_HAVING peru&s;ed your wonder|ful Remarks on the Eighteen Pre&s;byterian Mini&s;ters Letter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> the Archbi&s;hop, and therewith your Declaration of your Zeal for the Cau&s;e of the LORD, and your De&s;ire to open the Eyes of your Fellow-Chri&s;tians; it kindled in me a De&s;ire of Acce&s;s to you, in Order to my clearer In&s;truction: As I may ven|ture to &s;ay, I have nothing more at Heart, than to be truly enlightened in the Path of Duty. But as you are plea&s;ed to conceal your&s;elf under the general Characters of <HI>Lay-Man</HI> and <HI>Farmer,</HI> of which we have va&s;t Numbers; I could devi&s;e no other Method to obtain my De&s;ire, than by &s;end|ing out this Addre&s;s among the Farmers, hoping thereby, to find out the famous Farmer: For it is a Pity that &s;o famous a Talent as his, &s;hould be hid; or that &s;uch a Candle &s;hould be put under a Bu&s;hel.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="008927_0003_1030872E47E44768">As &s;everal &s;trange Things are pre&s;ented to me, di&s;per&s;ed here and there, through your none-&s;uch Performance, and I intend to be very brief; I &s;hall &s;et a few of tho&s;e My&s;teries in one View.</P>
<P>To begin then with your wonderful Ar|guments gathered from the afore&s;aid Letter, you ob&s;erve;</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That the A&mdash;hb&mdash;p is a Prelate of the Church of England; therefore he cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to have any Grace.</P>
<P><HI>Second,</HI> The Eighteen Pre&s;byterian Mi|ni&s;ters allow the A&mdash;hb&mdash;p to have Grace, and the Church of England to be Chri&s;tian; therefore they are &s;ecret Enemies to Pre&s;by|terians.</P>
<P><HI>Third,</HI> The A&mdash;hb&mdash;p denies a Parity of Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters, and holds Epi&s;copal Ordination to be Apo&s;tolical, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> there|fore he can be no Friend at all to Truth.</P>
<P><HI>Fourth,</HI> The&s;e Eighteen Mini&s;ters &s;ay, they were providencially convened at <HI>Phila|delphia;</HI> therefore they in&s;inuate to the A&mdash;hb&mdash;p, that the Sub&s;cribing &s;aid Let|ter, was a Synodical Act.</P>
<P><HI>Fifth,</HI> The&s;e Men &s;igned that Letter; therefore they pre&s;umed to &s;ap the very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">oundation of Pre&s;byterian Di&s;cipline.</P>
<P><HI>Sixth,</HI> They &s;ay, a very remarkable Ble&s;|&s;ing attended Mr. <HI>MecClanachan</HI>'s Mini&s;try; therefore they bring a hard Charge again&s;t Pre&s;byteriani&s;m in general.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="008927_0004_1030873357176C38"><HI>Seventh,</HI> They a&s;&s;ure the A&mdash;hb&mdash;p, that they will not be accountable for any Man's Prudentials in every Part of his Con|duct; therefore they in&s;inuate, that they think them&s;elves qualified to be Bond&s;men for other Peoples Goodne&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Eighth,</HI> They tell the A&mdash;hb&mdash;p, there are Fundamental Doctrines of the Chri&s;tian Religion and Prote&s;tant Reformation pro|fe&s;&s;ed by the Church of England, in which they can agree with that Church; therefore they are <HI>Church-Betrayers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ninth,</HI> They &s;ay, the A&mdash;hb&mdash;p pre|&s;ides over the Engli&s;h Church; therefore they are hypocritical double-dealing Men, and allow him Precedency; whereas, had they been Chri&s;tians, they would have dealt plainly with him,&mdash;and told him, that he was in a damnable State, till he conde&s;cended to the Level of his Brethren.</P>
<P><HI>Tenth,</HI> The&s;e Men &s;ay, that a di&s;intere&s;t|ed Regard to the Fundamentals of Religion, and the Cau&s;e of Virtue and practical Piety, con&s;trained them to engage in this Affair; therefore they have given up with every Objection, that has been advanced again&s;t the Engli&s;h Church; for which the Meet|ing-Hou&s;e Doors &s;hould be &s;hut again&s;t them.</P>
<P>THESE, <HI>Sir,</HI> are &s;ome of your very rare Arguments, which, I confe&s;s, I &s;hould
<PB N="6" REF="008927_0005_1030873506A3B500">
never have thought of, being as little ac|quainted with the Subtilities of School-learning as your&s;elf, if not le&s;s.</P>
<P>I fear, all the Schools will deny, that &s;uch Logick is taught in them; &s;o that you are like to have the Honour of that noble Invention to your &s;elf. Be&s;ides, I fear it will not find Credit among the greate&s;t Part of tho&s;e, you call dear Fellow-Chri&s;tians, till you have afforded clearer Light to open their Eyes, than you have yet done.</P>
<P>THE next Point I want Clearne&s;s in, is about tho&s;e new Opinions you hold, of the Engli&s;h Church; namely, that &s;he is not Chri&s;tian: That if &s;he be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Truth, the Pre&s;byterians mu&s;t be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Error: And finally, that the Dragon and his Angels, &s;poken of in Revelation, are her Prelates and their cur&s;ed Curates. The&s;e Things, <HI>Dear Sir,</HI> I am afraid will ruffle the Temper of &s;ome of the angry Fellows of the Engli&s;h Church, and will not go well down with the Bulk of Pre&s;by|terians, unle&s;s they are better proven; for we have been u&s;ed to think otherwi&s;e. You tell us, they are not new, but were held by <HI>Calvin</HI> and <HI>Knox,</HI> and our Godly Reformers; but as we have nothing to &s;upport the&s;e A&s;|&s;ertions but your bare Word, they will hardly believe for us. They allow, that &s;ome Mini&s;ters of that Church have been
<PB N="7" REF="008927_0006_10308736B3AF9140">
eminent and pious, and preached and wrote &s;oundly: &s;uch as Bi&s;hop <HI>U&s;her,</HI> Mr. <HI>Harvey,</HI> and others, that I might mention; but I think, they have ju&s;t Rea&s;on indeed to la|ment, that it is too evident to be denied, that a great Number of them, e&s;pecially in this Country, are vain and vicious in their Lives, as well as in&s;ipid and un&s;ound in their Doctrine; by which Means many poor Souls have neither proper Example nor In&s;truction to lead them in the Paths of Piety. The Pre&s;byterians would be glad, and I am well per&s;uaded, the Eighteen Mi|ni&s;ters are not of tho&s;e among them, who would be lea&s;t glad, if all, or any of that Church, would truly preach, and warmly inculcate tho&s;e Articles of the Church of England, in which they have the Happine&s;s to agree with that Church; for they de&s;ire the Welfare of others, as well as of them|&s;elves. And &s;undry of my Neighbours are of Opinion, that [:let Mr. <HI>MecClanachan</HI> be what he will otherwi&s;e:] yet if he had not preached and vindicated tho&s;e Go&s;pel-Doctrines &s;o clearly, and inculcated them &s;o warmly as he did, there would not have been &s;uch an Uproar made about him; nor would the Remarks on the Mini&s;ters Letter have had &s;o many Abettors, who &s;ecretly rejoice, that they have them to make a Handle of, to promote their own low, and
<PB N="8" REF="008927_0007_1030873AB246A6B8">
&s;ome perhaps, their malicious De&s;igns, to blacken tho&s;e Mini&s;ters Characters, and de&s;troy their Influence, if po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>BUT I mu&s;t proceed a little farther, and enquire with Re&s;pect to tho&s;e Eighteen Mi|ni&s;ters Character, who, you &s;ay, are Hypo|crites, fal&s;e-hearted Pre&s;byterians, Church|men in Heart, illeterate Mechanicks, vainly expecting to be noticed by Men of high De|gree either in Church or State, and have been boxing the Compa&s;s for a Living, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Will they not be apt to charge you with Lying and Slander? And the Truth is, I know not how you will be able to free your|&s;elf from the Charge, unle&s;s you can &s;up|port your Allegations by &s;ome better Proof than your bare SAYSO. Will they not be apt to tell you, that you have not only be|lied them in &s;aying, they denied, that their Brethren had Grace, and that they had a Method of judging a Man's State by his Face? with many other Things of like kind; but that you likewi&s;e belied <HI>Calvin</HI> and <HI>Knox,</HI> and the whole Body of Pre&s;by|terians, in telling the World, that the&s;e never believed, that the Church of Eng|land was Chri&s;tian, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And yet you have not produced one Proof for your A&s;|&s;ertion, notwith&s;tanding you &s;aid, you would give an Hundred. But no Doubt you think your Word is &s;ufficient Proof,
<PB N="9" REF="008927_0008_1030873D84666760">
being a Man of &s;uch &s;uperior Abilities, as not only to judge a Man's State by his Face, but to judge the A&mdash;b&mdash;ps State at &s;ome thou|&s;and Miles Di&s;tance. Will they not be apt to enquire, who told you their Conduct in Synod la&s;t Year? and to charge you with Slander in a&s;&s;erting, that they endeavoured to introduce Innovations into Synod? For I am well inform'd, they only attempted to have good Regulations formed, in Order the better to pre&s;erve the Decorum of the Body, in their judicial Tran&s;actions, which Regu|lations were at length agreed upon without a Di&s;&s;enting Vote. Will they not think that in&s;atiable Malice, of &s;ome ill De&s;ign or o|ther, moves you and your Abettors, to &s;tir up an antient Spirit of Partyi&s;m and Slan|der? Do not a Number of your Expre&s;&s;i|ons too evidently lean that Way? Will not they and the World judge, that they are as fit to &s;end a Letter to a Per&s;on in higher Sphere of Life, as a Number of weak and &s;candalous Creatures have been to appear before &s;uch in Per&s;on, to receive Orders for the holy Mini&s;try? If the&s;e Men are &s;o much inclined to the Church, as you would repre&s;ent them, why have not any of them, or of that Side they were formerly united to, whom you &s;eem to &s;trike at thro' them, why, I &s;ay, have not one of the&s;e gone to, and been received by the Church as well as
<PB N="10" REF="008927_0009_103087405EDEB9A8">
other Pre&s;byterians? Is not a Gown as ready for them, as it was for <HI>Hindman, Bell, Lion, Evans</HI> and <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> Men of in|famous Character, with &s;undry others that I might mention? Except the Bi&s;hop would cho&s;e to reject Men of good Character, while he received the weak and the wicked, which I believe you will not venture to a&s;|&s;ert. You &s;ay they have been boxing the Compa&s;s for a Living. I believe you did not con&s;ider, when you wrote the&s;e Expre&s;|&s;ions, nor do others, that are fond to u&s;e them. What if the&s;e Gentlemen &s;hould enquire, who boxed the Compa&s;s, when a Number of them left their native Land, not for their be&s;t Deeds, and &s;ome not for their great Abilities, and boxed the Com|pa&s;s here to &s;creen them&s;elves, and fi&s;h for a Living among Pre&s;byterians? What would you think, if they &s;hould a&s;k, who boxed the Compa&s;s, when a certain Gentle|man wrote to <HI>England</HI> re&s;pecting his Ex|ploits in defending our Frontiers? Exploits done by others, which he called his own, [:as he did the Sermon he printed, which was done by another Gentleman:] for which Lie he got Twenty Pounds annexed to his Salary. What if they &s;hould farther enquire, who boxed the Compa&s;s, when one of this Gentleman's Fraternity, being too vain and dull to be acceptable to Pre&s;by|terians,
<PB N="11" REF="008927_0010_103087424D3B5C10">
applied to the Study and Practice of the Law; but finding him&s;elf too great a Dunce for that Profe&s;&s;ion, he forged Cre|dentials, went and preached to an ignorant People, till he got &s;ome Money, after which he marched to the Bi&s;hop for Orders. What if they &s;hould put the&s;e and many other Que&s;tions, which I believe they might with Ju&s;tice do, till I were weary writing and you with reading them? You repre|&s;ent them as-illiterate Mechanicks; but the World is too well acquainted with their Abilities, to conclude them &s;uch clowni&s;h &s;currilous Flings, that they either want Sen&s;e or Learning. Were an Acquaintance with Mechani&s;m a Crime, by far the great|e&s;t Part of them are innocent of it. If two or three did under&s;tand &s;omething of it, will this prove, they had not a regular Education? Your clum&s;y Calumny equally &s;trikes at the great Apo&s;tle PAUL him&s;elf, as an illiterate Dunce; for he was a Tent-maker. But perhaps if the Eighteen Mi|ni&s;ters had been Dupes and Dunces, or even Debauchees, they might have e&s;caped all the&s;e Charges.</P>
<P>I would now conclude this Addre&s;s, only I can not help taking Notice of the prodigious Agitation you &s;eemed to be put in by the&s;e Men praying the A&mdash;hb&mdash;p. And I do not wonder at it, when you found
<PB N="12" REF="008927_0011_10308743F880B4D8">
out &s;uch horrible Idolatry in it, as I know not, if ever any of the Children of Men made &s;uch a rare Di&s;covery of before your own penetrating &s;elf. The mo&s;t of us u&s;ed to think, that they might pray a Man to grant a Favour, without &s;o much as &s;up|po&s;ing, they were chargeable with Idolatry. But then you have not only found the&s;e Men, together with the greate&s;t Part of the pre&s;ent Generation, guilty of this hor|rible Crime, but your A&s;&s;ertion would in|volve the Patriarch ABRAHAM in the &s;ame Guilt; for he not only prayed, but bowed down to the Children of HETH. But may not &s;ome of them enquire, how much bet|ter is your Conduct, if it is not much wor&s;e, in praying [:perhaps &s;ome may call it &s;wearing:] in the Name of <HI>Calvin</HI> and <HI>Knox,</HI> who are at be&s;t but departed Saints?</P>
<P>The&s;e are a few of the Things, that are &s;o difficult to me, and to many others, and if you do not come from your Concealment and explain them to us a little better, I be|lieve there will not be one real Pre&s;byterian on your Side; con&s;equently you will lo&s;e your Labour in attempting to open Eyes. But that is not all; for I fear, great Num|bers will be tempted to think, that you are &s;o far from being a Friend to Pre&s;byterians, that you are one of their mo&s;t inveterate
<PB N="13" REF="008927_0012_103087490F605720">
Enemies, endeavouring to repre&s;ent them as a very odious and uncharitable Sort of People, &s;carcely fit to live in a civilized Na|tion. Or if you are a Pre&s;byterian by Pro|fe&s;&s;ion, they will conclude, that you are an Enemy to them in Practice, and that Ma|lice has prompted you to write your Re|marks; and perhaps &s;ome Epi&s;copal is joined with you in the Affair. I believe, many will conclude, not only from the&s;e Gentlemens apparent Di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s in the Affair, but from their thorough Ac|quaintance with them, that they had a &s;ingle View to promote Religion, however they may not have &s;o duly con&s;idered all the Circum&s;tances of the Ca&s;e, and particularly the ill U&s;e that &s;pightful Per&s;ons would make of their Letter. But they will be obliged to conclude, that pre-conceived Ma|lice again&s;t the&s;e Men, becau&s;e perhaps you did not find, that they were <HI>Dunces,</HI> or wil|ling to be <HI>Dupes</HI> to you, moved you to re|mark. Or perhaps that you gladly and greedily &s;natched at this Opportunity; to prepare the Way for carrying on &s;ome ma|licious Plot, by attempting to de&s;troy, if po&s;&s;ible, the&s;e Mens Influence by Sophi&s;|try, Calumny and Lies. And if this be the Ca&s;e, have you not Rea&s;on to fear, that the Bla&s;t of Divine Providence will
<PB N="14" REF="008927_0013_1030874AC2094168">
con&s;ume your De&s;igns, as Snow melts off the Fields by warm Sun-Beams. But what|ever your Profe&s;&s;ion is, if this poor Attempt of mine, or any other Invitation of like kind that may be given, may be a Means of bringing you forth to Light, and you can confirm and e&s;tabli&s;h the&s;e Remarks of yours, then I doubt not, but you will meet with &s;ufficient Encouragement to &s;weep you from the Plough-Tail, &s;eeing that is &s;uch a de&s;picable Bu&s;ine&s;s, and without boxing the Compa&s;s, &s;et you in a Sphere large enough to employ your Talent of opening Eyes.</P>
<P>IF you enquire after me, <HI>Sir,</HI> I can a&s;|&s;ure you, you will neither find me in the Pulpits, nor in the Schools of Learning, nor have any of tho&s;e employed in &s;uch Places, moved me to this Attempt, or dic|tated to me while I wrote. The Truth of what I now a&s;&s;ert, the unpoli&s;hed Plainne&s;s of my Addre&s;s will confirm. But you may find me among the Black-Smiths Shops, belonging to the Pre&s;byterians in Che&s;ter-County.</P>
