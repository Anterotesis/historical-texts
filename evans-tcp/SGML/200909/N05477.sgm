<Q><BIBL><HI>1 Chron. 29 chap. from the 10 to 15. Ver&s;e</HI></BIBL>
<P>Wherefore David ble&s;&s;ed the Lord before all the Congregation: And David &s;aid, ble&s;&s;ed be thou Lord God of I&s;rael our Father for ever and ever: Thine O Lord is the Greatne&s;s, and Power, and the Glory, and the Victory, and the Maje&s;ty; for all that is in the Heaven and the Earth is thine; thine is the King|dom O Lord, and thou art exalted as Head above all. Both Riches and Honour come of thee, and thou reigne&s;t over all; and in thine Hand is Power and Might, and in thine Hand it is to make great and to give Strength unto all. Now therefore, our God, we thank thee and prai&s;e thy glorious Name: But who am I, and what is my People, that we &s;hould be able to offer &s;o willingly after this Sort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.</P></Q>

<P>_THE Context informs us, that King <HI>David</HI> excited the Prin|ces and People of I&s;rael, to con|tribute towards the Building and furni&s;hing of the Temple, by a beautiful and moving Addre&s;s; the principal Arguments of which were drawn
<PB N="4" REF="006940_0003_102A9C6C0A871180">
from the Greatne&s;s of the Work to be done, the Glory of its Object, and his own Affection and Example; <HI>the Work is great,</HI> &s;aith he, and therefore all &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t in it, and <HI>the Palace is not for Man, but for the Lord God,</HI> and therefore we &s;hould exert our utmo&s;t in erecting and adorning it; that hereby we may te&s;tify our Affection to his Maje&s;ty, and our honourable Sentiments of his Glory; which the Beauty, the Grandeur, and Magnificence of the &s;acred Structure are be&s;t adapted to repre&s;ent: If it was for Man, a Worm, a Moth, no matter how mean it be; but &s;eeing it is for God, the great and glorious God, it &s;hould be &s;tate|ly and magnificent: He proceeds to &s;peak of his own Affection and Example, in the&s;e Words; <HI>I have prepared with all my Might for the Hou&s;e of my God; moreover, becau&s;e I have &s;ett my Affection to the Hou&s;e of my God, I have of mine own proper good, Gold and Silver, given to the Hou&s;e of my God.</HI> This pious Prince lov'd the Habitation of Jehovahs-Hou&s;e, the Place where his Honour dwells, with great Inten&s;ene&s;s, as the Re|petition of his Words concerning it, but now mentioned, do plainly import; and he evidenced the Sincerity, and vehemence of his love, by the largene&s;s of his generous and noble Donations!</P>
<P>But to bring the Matter to a Point, the King of I&s;rael, one of the greate&s;t Monarchs of his Time in the World, put on the humble Form of a Petitioner, to
<PB N="5" REF="006940_0004_102A9C6DD08629E0">
his own People, his Inferiors, and Subjects, and acco&s;ts them in the&s;e affecting Terms; <HI>and who then is willing to con&s;ecrate his Service this Day to the Lord;</HI> as if he had &s;aid, I beg not for Man that is a Worm, or the Son of Man that is a Worm, but for God, who&s;e ye are, and to whom ye owe your all; what you give towards the Temple, is con&s;ecrated, or religiou&s;ly dedicated to his Service and Glory: This amiable Conde|&s;cen&s;ion of the Prince, did more Honour to him&s;elf, then to the Cau&s;e he &s;erv'd by it: So great and honourable a Pre&s;ident, &s;hou'd me thinks either &s;creene from invective, rudene&s;s, and in&s;ult, Per&s;ons of inferior Figure who make the like commendable attempt for God, or &s;upport them under &s;uch unmanly and unchri&s;tian Treatment!</P>
<P>But to proceed, the King's Petition and Addre&s;s, was immediately crowned with de&s;ired Succe&s;s; the Chief of the Fathers, the Princes of the <HI>Tribes</HI> of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> the <HI>Captains</HI> of <HI>Hundreds</HI> and of <HI>Thou&s;ands,</HI> with others, offered willingly large Donations; which occa&s;ioned great and univer&s;al Glad|ne&s;s, in that va&s;t, grand, and augu&s;t A&s;|&s;embly; <HI>the People rejoiced, for they offer'd willingly and with a perfect Heart; i. e.</HI> freely and &s;incerely, with a view to the Glory of God; in Te&s;timony hereof, the Prince appeals to the Almighty in this &s;olemn Manner; <HI>I know al&s;o my God, that thou trie&s;t the Heart, and ha&s;t Plea&s;ure in Uprightne&s;s, as for me &s;aith he, in the Up|rightne&s;s

of my Heart, I have willingly offer'd the&s;e things.</HI> &mdash;It is a great Comfort to tho&s;e that hone&s;tly &s;eek and &s;erve God, to con|&s;ider, that he perfectly knows the &s;ecret Spring, and ultimate Scope of their Actions; and that he is plea&s;ed with Uprightne&s;s: Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of Integrity is a va&s;t &s;upport, under the unkind and ungenerous invectives, of a giddy in&s;table World, that is unhap|pily divided into various Parties, and on that Account bya&s;&s;ed by various Prejudices again&s;t each other; and truly tho&s;e who mo&s;t excel in Sincerity them&s;elves, are lea&s;t inclined to que&s;tion and cen&s;ure the Conduct of their Brethren. <HI>David</HI> being certain of his own Uprightne&s;s, Candour and Charity, which thinks no Evil, inclin'd him to judge favourably of others; <HI>The People rejoiced, becau&s;e with perfect Heart, they of|fer'd willingly to the Lord; and David the King al&s;o rejoiced, with great Joy;</HI> they were glad of the Opportunity and Pri|vilege of honouring the Lord in this Man|ner with their Sub&s;tance, and plea&s;ed with the Pro&s;pect of bringing that important Work to an honourable and comfortable Period, which they had &s;et their Hearts &s;o much upon: They were glad that they had &s;omething to give to God, and that they had a Heart to give it freely, with|out grudging, and uprightly without ba&s;e and by Ends. Matters being bro't to this comfortable cri&s;is, the King on this Oc|ca&s;ion, &s;olemnly addre&s;&s;ed God in the Words

of our Text, <HI>wherefore David ble&s;&s;ed the Lord before all the Congregation of I&s;rael and &s;aid, ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord God of I&s;rael our Father, for ever and ever;</HI> He gave to God the Glory of that Gladne&s;s, he felt on this agreeable Occa&s;ion; and adored him with Reverence and Affection, by acknowledging his in|finite and tran&s;cendant Eminence; <HI>thine O Lord is the Greatne&s;s and the Power, and the Glory, and the Victory, and the Maje&s;ty;</HI> they are thine originally, thine e&s;&s;entially, thine independantly, thine invariably, thine eternally: Thou ha&s;t them in and of thy &s;elf, and art the &s;ource and center of them. Gods Greatne&s;s is immen&s;e and incompre|hen&s;ible, his Power ab&s;olute and irre&s;i&s;table, to him belong Glory and Victory. Seeing God is the Author of all, it is but rea&s;onable that his Honour and Glory &s;hou'd be the End of all; <HI>all things are of him, and thro' him and to him,</HI> &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, all Victory and Succe&s;s, in every noble and arduous Enterprize, is owing to the efficacious Influence of that great, powerful and glorious Being, who &s;ubdues all Things to him&s;elf, and is clothed with <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> as with a <HI>Robe,</HI> with <HI>Light</HI> as with a <HI>Garment:</HI> With God is ter|rible <HI>Maje&s;ty, (As Elihu ob&s;erves.)</HI> he is po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd of &s;uch tran&s;cendant Perfection, as cannot but &s;trike an awe upon all his at|tendants, and a Terror upon all his adver|&s;aries; &s;o overcoming and refulgent is the Maje&s;ty of God, that the Angels vail their Faces with their Wings before it, the

Saints in their embody'd <HI>State,</HI> faint under the glim&s;es of it; at this the Devils tremble, at this the Earths Foundations &s;hake, from this incen&s;ed the Heavens flee away! The P&s;almi&s;t farther aknowledges in the Words of our Text, Gods ab&s;olute Right to all Things as Creator, <HI>for all that is in the Heaven and in the Earth is thine,</HI> every Thing is more Gods, than any Thing is ours. His claim of Right is original, ab&s;olute and perpetual, becau&s;e by his Almightine&s;s he made all Things; but our Right is only &s;e|condary, derived and dependant, becau&s;e we have borrowed our Beings and all the Benefits we po&s;&s;e&s;s from him.</P>
<P>He likewi&s;e a&s;&s;erts God's Sovereign Domi|nion over all, as a Ruler and Governor; <HI>thine is the Kingdom O Lord, and thou art exalted as Head above all.</HI> That right to govern which is founded in ab&s;olute Property, is certainly the &s;tronge&s;t, mo&s;t equitable and permanent, and &s;uch is God's; and hence we are told even by a <HI>Pagan</HI> Prince, <HI>that his Kingdom is an e|verla&s;ting Kingdom, and that his Dominion is from Generation to Generation.</HI></P>
<P>To the&s;e the P&s;almi&s;t adds an explicit Con|fe&s;&s;ion of God's univer&s;al influence by his Providence, in the Conduct of human Affairs; &s;ucceeding Enterprizes, and di&s;tributing Do|nations among Men, according to his own So|vereign Plea&s;ure; <HI>Both Riches and Honour come of thee, and in thine Hand is Power and Might; thou reigne&s;t over all, and in thy Hand it is to make great, and to give &s;trength unto all.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="006940_0008_102A9C7704AFB118">Under this Con&s;ideration, he, in the Name of the whole A&s;&s;embly, affectionately Thanks God for his Goodne&s;s in inclining and enabling them to contribute &s;o chearfully towards the building of the Temple; <HI>now therefore our God we Thank thee and Prai&s;e thy glorious Name.</HI> 'Tis God, my Brethren, <HI>that works in us both to will and to do of his own good Plea&s;ure:</HI> Without his preventing influence, we are naturally aver&s;e to every Thing that is great, good, noble and generous: We are apt to frame all the plau&s;ible Pretexts we can to conceal our ill Nature and Avarice; we mu&s;t therefore a&s;cribe the glory of all the good that is done by our&s;elves or others to God, avoiding with equal care and caution, the unrea&s;onable and perilous Evils of &s;acrificing to our own Net, and dependance on our own Righteou&s;ne&s;s. The whole A&s;&s;embly &s;igni|fy'd their cordial concurrence with the afore|&s;aid &s;olemn Celebration of the divine Prai&s;e, by a ge&s;ture of Adoration and Reverence, <HI>they bowed down their Heads, and wor&s;hiped the Lord and the King.</HI> <Q>The Ge&s;ture was alike, but the Intention of the Mind was different</Q>

humbly both of him&s;elf and them; <HI>but who am I, and what is my People, that we &s;hould be able to offer &s;o willingly after this &s;ort? For all Things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.</HI> King <HI>David,</HI> and his Princes and People, were certainly the mo&s;t honour|able Per&s;ons in the World at that Time, and yet behold and admire, with what deep and truly amiable aba&s;ement he &s;poke of him&s;elf and them, <HI>who am I, and what is my People?</HI> how mean, how &s;inful, how frail, how de&s;pica|ble? Creatures! who are but of Ye&s;terday, and have no abiding; that the great God &s;hould take &s;uch kind Cognizance of us, and put &s;uch immerited Honour upon us, as to in|cline and enable us, freely to dedicate to his Glory and Service, a little of what he graci|ou&s;ly gave us, by his all ruling Providence, and which was indeed, and ever remains, his own, originally and ab&s;olutely, by the &s;trong|e&s;t claims of right.</P>
<P>The Text which I have read and explained, opens too large a field of Matter to be fully di&s;cu&s;s'd in the &s;mall compa&s;s of two Di&s;cour|&s;es, I &s;hall therefore confine my Meditations to the&s;e few important Points, which I take to be the Sub&s;tance and Scope of the whole, <HI>viz,</HI> the GOVERNMENT of GOD by his Pro|vidence over all; and that GRATITUDE and PRAISE, which is due to him on Account of Mercies communicated by it, particularly of a publick and religious Kind.</P>
<P>Government, my Brethren, in its nature
<PB N="11" REF="006940_0010_102A9C7A5144C6C0">
implies, Right, Power, and the Exerci&s;e there|of in the di&s;po&s;al of Things.</P>
<P>Rule without Right, is U&s;urpation; but the Almighty is the fountain and original of all rightful Authority, in the Family, the State, the Church; as it is all derived from him and dependant on him, &s;o it &s;hould be all &s;ubordinate to him, who is the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords: On this Account the Apo&s;tle urges Subjection to the higher Powers, becau&s;e <HI>there is no Power but of God, and the Powers that be, are ordained of God.</HI> But be&s;ides a Right to Rule, which is Pro|perly called Authority, Power or Strength is likewi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary to manage the Reigns of Government, and keep the rul'd in Subjection; without which Government is but an empty Name; and hence when it is mentioned in Scripture, the Word Power is generally an|nexed to it, as particularly in the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages, (of the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> and the Apo&s;tle <HI>John) he ruleth by his Power for ever. The Lord God Omni|potent reigneth.</HI> Our Text is likewi&s;e very full to this Purpo&s;e; nay &s;o nece&s;&s;ary is Pow|er to all Government, that it is even called by that Name, to &s;hew that they are in&s;eparable, <HI>there is no Power but of God:</HI> In a word, all Pretence to Government, without Power, is a meer Farce, which de&s;erves rather to be de|rided than obey'd.</P>
<P>Farther, in Government there is an Exer|ci&s;e of Authority and Power in ordering Things &s;o as to make them &s;erve the Gover|nors
<PB N="12" REF="006940_0011_102A9C7C622C8130">
De&s;ign; and hence the Apo&s;tle informs us, that <HI>God Works all Things after the Council of his own Will;</HI> and our Saviour a&s;&s;ures us, that <HI>his Father worketh hitherto, and that he works.</HI></P>
<P>The ble&s;&s;ed God, my Brethren, never acts without De&s;ign, and his De&s;igns are ever worthy of him&s;elf, and bear the Characters of his Attributes. Whatever Honour might be reflected on the Divine Wi&s;dom and Pow|er by the fir&s;t Production of Things, it would be &s;oon eclip&s;ed by their con&s;equent irregulari|ties, without the interpo&s;ure of his Providence.</P>
<P>As it is ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, that an infinitely wi&s;e Being &s;hould make Creatures for no End at all; &s;o it is equally ab&s;urd to imagine, that he does not conduct them to the End de&s;ign'd by his Providence.</P>
<P>Now it is only creating Wi&s;dom that per|fectly under&s;tands univer&s;al Nature, that per|fectly &s;pys every &s;pring of Motion, and there|fore can correct the Errors of the Univer&s;e. 'Tis only an infinite Mind, in concurrence with Almightine&s;s, that can take thorough Cognizance and proper Care of that grand <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> of Beings, the &s;pacious <HI>Theatre</HI> of Na|ture contains; that can allot to every Crea|ture its Portion, and adju&s;t the Intere&s;ts of Kingdoms and States; and fora&s;much as no meer Creature po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the&s;e Perfections of infinite Wi&s;dom and Power, the World mu&s;t needs be governed by him that made it.</P>
<P>And indeed if we con&s;ider his Nature and
<PB N="13" REF="006940_0012_102A9C805B379EF0">
Attributes, we may &s;oon perceive that he is not only qualify'd for, but in &s;ome Mea&s;ure nece&s;&s;itated to, take upon him the Govern|ment of the Univer&s;e: For does not the End and Perfection of his Attributes con&s;i&s;t in their exerci&s;e? Certainly the End of Wi&s;dom is De&s;ign, the End of Power is Action, and the End of Goodne&s;s doing Good: To &s;ay that the&s;e Perfections are not exercis'd upon pro|per Objects and Occa&s;ions, is to repre&s;ent them as in&s;ignificant. Of what u&s;e would the <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> of <HI>Jehovah</HI> be, if he had nothing to de&s;ign or direct; to what purpo&s;e his <HI>Almigh|tine&s;s,</HI> if all Things were done without him, and of what avail his <HI>Goodne&s;s,</HI> if he ever le&s;t the innocent as a prey to misfortunes; there mu&s;t therefore be a <HI>Providence</HI> that governs over all.</P>
<P>The Almighty has implanted in mo&s;t Crea|tures, a natural Care of their Offspring, and repre&s;ents it as an Argument of the want of Under&s;tanding in the <HI>O&s;trich,</HI> that <HI>&s;he leaveth her Eggs in the Earth, forgeteth that the foot may cru&s;h them, and is hardened again&s;t her young ones as tho' they were not hers.</HI> Now can we, without Incon&s;i&s;tency and Bla&s;phemy, impute &s;uch a carele&s;s Character to God, re|&s;pecting the Offspring of his Power, as he condemns in the <HI>O&s;trich?</HI> Can we &s;uppo&s;e that when almo&s;t every Creature is tender of its Young, every pious Parent &s;olicitous for the Protection and &s;upport of his de&s;cen|dants, that there &s;hould be no Bowels of
<PB N="14" REF="006940_0013_102A9C82CEFE5D18">
Compa&s;&s;ion in the ble&s;&s;ed God, who is love and goodne&s;s it&s;elf, to incline him to provide for that numerous Family that have their con|tinual dependance on him? No &s;urely! His love infinitely exceeds the Tenderne&s;s of the mo&s;t indulgent Relations: A Woman may forget her &s;ucking Child, but God's People are graven on the Palms of his Hands, ever in View, ever in Memory. Is it natural to a Mother to nouri&s;h and embrace her In|fant-Offspring with the fonde&s;t Care and ten|dere&s;t Care&s;&s;es; does the Sun rejoice to ble&s;s the benighted World with its Light and In|fluence, and does a Fountain murmur till it is delivered of its Streams, which refre&s;h the parched Earth; and is it no delight to the Father of Mercies to diffu&s;e Kindne&s;s and Be|nignity to the mi&s;erable?</P>
<P>Another Argument of God's providential Government, my Brethren, ari&s;es from the Nature of Man&punc; con&s;idered either in a &s;ingle, &s;ocial or religious Character. If we con&s;ider Man in a <HI>private Capacity,</HI> the nece&s;&s;ity of a Providence to guide and guard him, is very apparent: The many Dangers and Accidents to which Life is expos'd in all the Stages of it, and e&s;pecially in its early Infant dawn, render it impracticable, to e&s;cape with &s;afety, if a particular Providence, however indi&s;cern|able in its Operations, did not interpo&s;e to protect us, and ward off the falling Blow.</P>
<P>Nor is the Argument of a divine Government, le&s;s conclu&s;ive, when we con&s;ider Man in a <HI>&s;ocial
<PB N="15" REF="006940_0014_102A9C8457A69890">
Capacity:</HI> The Degeneracy of human Nature is great in all, and &s;ome in particular, &s;o ar|rogant and overbearing; &s;ome &s;o covetous and de&s;igning, &s;ome &s;o furious and malignant, that all Order and Security would be &s;pedily un|hing'd, the Bands of Society di&s;&s;olved, and the whole World become a melancholly and terrible Theatre of the mo&s;t calamitous Evils and de&s;tructive Tragidies, were it not for the interpo&s;ure of a divine Providence, which bounds the arrogance, avarice and cruelty of Mankind, as the threatning Surges of the en|raged Ocean, and protects the Ju&s;t.</P>
<P>And if Man be con&s;idered in a <HI>religious Character,</HI> the Nece&s;&s;ity of a divine Go|vernment is equaly con&s;picious, mo&s;t of the Acts of religious Wor&s;hip re&s;pect God not meerly as a univer&s;al Cau&s;e, but as our particular Protector, and therefore unle&s;s we are per&s;waded that he takes an immediate Care of all his Creatures, and particularly of tho&s;e who revere and &s;erve him, in the Government of every event, why &s;hou'd we fear his Re&s;entments, or confide in his Pro|mi&s;&s;es, why &s;hou'd we implore him for Pro|tection in Dangers, and a &s;upply of our Wants, or prai&s;e him for any Benefit we po&s;&s;e&s;s, &s;eeing according to the afore&s;aid <HI>Hypothe&s;is,</HI> they do not come by his Interpo&s;ure and Direction! The <HI>Roman Orator</HI> &s;peaks with great ju&s;tne&s;s of Sentiment, and beauty of Diction upon this Head in the following
<PB N="16" REF="006940_0015_102A9C87A3CEABF8">

And if we take all Religion out of the World, what will become of unhappy mi&s;erable Mankind, nothing will be left but a Scene of Confu&s;ion and Calamity of every Kind and Form, all Integrity, all Solace, all Safty, and con&s;equently all Society will be at one di&s;mal Stoke bani&s;hed from the Earth! Another Evidence of Gods Govern|ment over all, is the Continuance of all Things, in the &s;ame comely order in which they were at fir&s;t created: 'Tis a delight|full Entertainment to the Mind, to take a &s;urvey of all the &s;urprizing Wonders in Nature; to ob&s;erve with what Art and Contrivance particular Creatures are form'd and how the &s;everal Parts of the whole are, with the greate&s;t exactne&s;s, adapted and proportioned to each other, &s;o as to make one great regular and uniform Sy&s;tem; and to preceive how all the various Ranks of Creatures within the <HI>Scale</HI> of exi&s;tance, are as it were by the mo&s;t curious mechani&s;m,

<P>Tho' the Elements of which the World is compo&s;ed, have different, yea contrary Qualities, yet this repugnancy is &s;o tempered and re&s;trained, that they do not mutually de&s;troy each other, agreeable to their natu|ral Tendencies, but keep within their pro|per Bounds, and therein &s;erve the good of the whole <HI>Sy&s;tem.</HI></P>
<P>And as the con&s;tant Pre&s;ervation of the World, &s;o the &s;trange and wonderful Ocurren|cies that &s;ometimes happen in it, are another Argument of a Divine all-governing Pro|vidence.

<P>But not only all the Parts of the Univer&s;e, with the Creatures they contain, are under the divine Government, but every Action likewi&s;e, for in him <HI>we live and move and have our Being:</HI> All the Wheels of Nature are form'd by his Power, and manag'd by his Providence according to his Plea&s;ure; nor do any of them move without at lea&s;t his Per|mi&s;&s;ion and Support.</P>
<P>Moreover the divine Government reaches all <HI>Events:</HI> This is the Rea&s;on that &s;ometimes the be&s;t concerted Schemes, and mo&s;t pro|mi&s;ing Attempts, fail of Succe&s;s, while the

<P>And tho' the State of Things appears &s;ometimes dark and confu&s;ed, yet does divine Providence pre&s;ide over them, and by its a|mazing and incomprehen&s;ible Agency, extract Light and Order from them; a pregnant In|&s;tance of this we have in the ca&s;e of <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s &s;ufferings by his Brethren, and after Advance|ment to the Dominion of <HI>Egypt:</HI> Here di|vine Providence molded a dark confus'd <HI>Chaos</HI> into a beautiful form: Here the orient Colours laid on, derive a lu&s;tre from the blackne&s;s of the Ground; and a contra&s;t of Characters, and De&s;igns, in the Ca&s;es and Agents that com|po&s;e the Piece, the Scene! What they thought for Evil, the Almighty meant for good; he &s;ometimes &s;erves the Purpo&s;es of his Providence by the Agency of Creatures, not only be&s;ides, but even contrary to their Intention. <HI>Senacherib</HI> the <HI>A&s;yrian</HI> Monarch, was us'd by the Hand of Providence as a rod to correct the People of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and as an In|&s;trument to bring them to Repentance, <HI>how|beit he meant not &s;o, neither did his Heart think &s;o:</HI> No!

<P>But to proceed, Things natural, nece&s;&s;ary and accidental, are likewi&s;e under the divine Government. Almighty God is the Father of the Rain, and begets by his Providence, the gentle Drops of the Dew; he brings the Snow and Hail out of his Trea&s;ures, he holds the Winds in his Fi&s;ts, and makes the Thun|der and Lightning to fullfil his Word: He fixes the Cour&s;e of Nature, &s;o that it gene|rally acts in a uniform way.

<P>To this we may reply, that there are Examples in every Age of God's rewarding the good, and puni&s;hing the bad; but this is not general or univer&s;al, becau&s;e this World is a &s;tate of Tryal and not of Re|compen&s;e: There will be a future Judgment, when Rewards and Puni&s;hments &s;hall be univer&s;ally and exactly di&s;tributed; in order to which the pre&s;ent Life is but a Pro|bation. Now it is unrea&s;onable to expect the Judgment before the Tryal, the Crown before the Combate. <Q>Puni&s;hments are &s;ome|times inflicted to put Men in Remembrance of God's Government, but not always, lea&s;t a future Judgment &s;hould be prevented.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Augu&s;tine.</NOTE>

<P>If outward Pro&s;perity be not good for bad Men, then the Force of the Objection vani&s;hes, but the Ca&s;e is realy thus; Pro|&s;perity is &s;o far from being good to them, that it is the very rever&s;e, it is like a &s;ick Patients u&s;ing &s;uch &s;trong Dyet as tends to make his di&s;ea&s;e incurable; Pro&s;perity flatters their Pride, and is fuel to their Luxury; by it they are <HI>fattened for the Day of Slaughter;</HI> <Q>we ought not to Lament, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;idore.</NOTE>

<P>From what has been &s;aid of God's Go|vernment, we may learn the Unrea&s;onable|ne&s;s and Danger of provoking by Sin, the angry Re&s;entments of &s;uch an Almigh|ty Being; which are as impo&s;&s;ible to be avoided as they are intollerable to be endured: a Being that can in a Moment turn all our Comforts into the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Mi|&s;eries, and make every Creature of the Cre|ation an Executioner of his Vengeance.</P>

Redeemer and Benefactor, and that our eter|nal all depends upon our Compliance.</P>
<P>If we are under Afflictions, we &s;hould look on them as coming by the Direction of that God, who is Wi&s;dom and Love it &s;elf, who does not <HI>afflict us willingly, nor grieve the Children of Men,</HI> but corrects in Mea&s;ure and in Mercy for our Profit, that he may make us partakers of his Holine&s;s: He knows be&s;t what is be&s;t for us, and will by his Power and Providence, make all Things work together for the Advantage of &s;uch as fear and &s;erve him. We &s;hou'd therefore be contented with our Lott, and chearfully commit our all to his Management; humbly confiding in him, who can with the ut|mo&s;t ea&s;e, and &s;tronge&s;t Certainty, &s;upply all our Wants, and protect us in the mid&s;t of the greate&s;t Dangers.

<P>_HAving &s;poken in the preceeding Di&s;cour&s;e, of the Government of God by his Providence, I would now proceed to &s;peak upon that THANKSGIVING and PRAISE which is due to him on Account of Mercies communicated by it, (to us) par|ticularly
<PB N="38" REF="006940_0037_102A9CB971ED47D0">
of a publick and religious Nature; preparatory to which let it be ob&s;erved, that tho' <HI>Prai&s;e</HI> and <HI>Thank&s;giving</HI> con&s;idered &s;trict|ly and critically, may be di&s;tingui&s;hed, yet I apprehend, that in our Text (by the Figure <HI>Hendiadis,</HI>) they are but two Words de&s;igned to &s;ignify the &s;ame Thing, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>Grati|tude</HI> in Sentiment, Speech and Behaviour, which we owe to God for all his Mercies towards us. The <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> being impre&s;&s;ed with a deep Sen&s;e of the Divine Goodne&s;s, enlarges upon the GRATITUDE due for it, in a variety of Expre&s;&s;ions of the &s;ame Ten|dency. In this View I &s;hall con&s;ider them in the following Di&s;cour&s;e, and proceed to ob&s;erve, that they nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;e a full <HI>Per&s;wa&s;ion</HI> of God's <HI>Government</HI> over all, and import a carefull <HI>Attention</HI> to the Ble&s;&s;ings we receive by it with our <HI>Minds;</HI> a ju&s;t <HI>value</HI> for them in our <HI>Judgments;</HI> a &s;incere <HI>Regard</HI> to their Author in our <HI>Hearts;</HI> a faithful <HI>Retention</HI> of them in our <HI>Memories;</HI> an open <HI>Celebration</HI> of them by our <HI>Lips,</HI> and a grateful <HI>Return</HI> for them by our Lives.</P>
<P>Without a full and &s;trong <HI>Per&s;wa&s;ion</HI> of God's ab&s;olute <HI>Empire</HI> over all Events, we will not look on the Benefits we receive, as com|ing by his Direction, and con&s;equently de|cline to expre&s;s the <HI>Gratitude</HI> which is due for them: It is therefore extremely ne|ce&s;&s;ary to endeavour in the U&s;e of all pro|per Means, to get this Sentiment deeply fix'd
<PB N="39" REF="006940_0038_102A9CBCA1184E28">
in our Souls. And having laid this noble Foundation, we &s;hould carefully <HI>attend</HI> with our <HI>Minds</HI> to the various and important Ble&s;|&s;ings we derive from the divine Government, <HI>who is wi&s;e and will ob&s;erve the&s;e Things, even they &s;hall under&s;tand the loving Kindne&s;s of the Lord.</HI> The Prophet ju&s;tly reproved the un|grateful <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> for this, that <HI>they regarded not the Work of the Lord, nor con&s;idered the O|peration of his Hands.</HI> Without a clo&s;e At|tention to, and &s;erious Con&s;ideration upon the Benefits we receive, our Minds are not like to be fir'd with Gratitude for them.</P>
<P>Nor is it le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>value</HI> highly in our Judgment, the Mercies we receive, <HI>how excellent is thy loving Kindne&s;s O God,</HI> (&s;aith the P&s;almi&s;t) <HI>how precious are thy Thoughts unto me, O how great is the Sum of them; if I &s;hould count them, they are more in Number than the Sand.</HI> A chearful acceptance of Benefits, and complacence in them, is the very Form and Spirit of Gratitude, and that which truly noble Benefactors have principally in View; no Sacrifice or Holocau&s;t is &s;o acceptable to the ble&s;&s;ed God, as a ju&s;t value for his Goodne&s;s: The Almighty not only loves a chearful giver, but a chearful receiver; he would have us to gu&s;t and reli&s;h his Benefits.</P>
<P>As a due Attention to the Mercies of God, naturally tends to excite our value for them, &s;o this value as naturally tends to inflame us with a &s;incere <HI>Regard</HI> to their <HI>Author</HI> in our <HI>Hearts.</HI> The <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, that he
<PB N="40" REF="006940_0039_102A9CC2AE4BDA38">
<HI>loved the Lord becau&s;e he heard the Voice of his Supplication.</HI> Nothing &s;o much endears God to the Soul, as a View and Sen&s;e of his immerited Goodne&s;s; <HI>we love him</HI> (&s;aith the Apo&s;tle) <HI>becau&s;e he fir&s;t loved us.</HI> The Truth is, we never love him with Freedom, Vehe|mence, and Tran&s;port, until we are fir&s;t fir'd with a Sen&s;e of his Love and Goodne&s;s, (to us) His love apprehended, like a Magnet attracts the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate and grateful Emotions, and vigorous Sallies of our Souls towards him, as the Source of our Benefits, and Center of our Re&s;t.</P>
<P>Farther, a faithful <HI>Retention</HI> of God's <HI>Mer|cies</HI> towards us, in our <HI>Memories,</HI> is nece&s;&s;a|ry to con&s;titute that Gratitude that God re|quires. <HI>Seneca</HI> ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, <Q>That he who fal&s;ely denies the Reception of a Bene|fit, and he that di&s;&s;embles it, and he that doth not repay it, is ungrateful; but mo&s;t ungrateful of all is he that forgets it.</Q> When Benefits are not remembered, it is a &s;ign they made no &s;uitable Impre&s;&s;ion on the Mind at fir&s;t, otherwi&s;e &s;ome di&s;cernable Traces of them would have remained there; and as there was no deep Impre&s;&s;ion, &s;o pro|bably no Thought of a grateful Return. The Almighty frequently complains of the ingratitude of the People of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> in for|getting his Works, and the Wonders that he had &s;hewed them. But the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t,</HI> who&s;e vigilant Gratitude it is our Duty and Intere&s;t to imitate, determined to <HI>remember God's
<PB N="41" REF="006940_0040_102A9CBEE057FFB0">
Wonders of old, and meditate on all his Works.</HI> It is a lamentable Evidence of the deep De|generacy of human Nature, that our Memo|ries are &s;o tenacious of Injuries, and &s;o for|getful of Benefits. <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> being ask'd, what grows the &s;oone&s;t Old? gave this Laconick An&s;wer. <HI>Thanks!</HI> A &s;evere, but alas, too ju&s;t a cen&s;ure upon the generality of Mankind. A cen&s;ure which every Thing that is great and honourable, &s;hould con&s;pire to incite us to guard our Conduct from. A Succe&s;&s;ion of new Benefits, &s;hould not &s;upplant and ef|face the Memory of ancient Mercies, but ra|ther render them more de&s;irable and amiable, like Liquours who&s;e Value is increa&s;ed by Age. The Memoirs of important Delive|rances, &s;hould be in&s;crib'd on our Minds with indelible Characters, as that of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> from <HI>Amaleck</HI> on the Altar, with a JEHOVAH NISI, the Lord is my Banner!</P>
<P>Another ingredient in <HI>real</HI> Gratitude, is an <HI>expre&s;s</HI> open <HI>acknowledgement</HI> of the Kind|ne&s;s of Heaven (towards us) by our Lips, and our great Obligations to God, on Ac|count of them; an explicit Declaration of the Value and Moment of his Benefits, as well as our unworthine&s;s of them, our inability to requite them, and of the Beauty of the divine Attributes opened in their Donation and Conveyance!</P>
<P>When grateful Love in&s;pires the Heart, it cannot but per&s;pire thro' the Lips, and make them move in Prai&s;e; as when the
<PB N="42" REF="006940_0041_102A9CC0A83D50B8">
main Spring of a Clock is well &s;et, the Wheels naturally move, and the Bell will not forget to proclaim the Numbers. Real Gratitude is of a diffu&s;ive, &s;ocial Genius; it wants others to &s;hare its &s;weets, to witne&s;s its tender Sentiments, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t its feeble Attempts in celebrating the divine Prai&s;e. Gratitude is innocently and nobly fond of Light, of Liberty and Society; the In&s;trument of which is Speech, which is never &s;o much our Glory as when employed in glorifying our God for his Goodne&s;s to|wards us.</P>
<P>But that which crowns the Scene, is a <HI>grateful return</HI> for Benefits received, by our Lives. Sincere Gratitude earne&s;tly pants after a requital, it wants to te&s;tify (&s;ome how) its high E&s;teem and dear Regard to its Be|nefactor, and to do him &s;ome Service, yea equal Service if po&s;&s;ible to the Benefits re|ceived. Its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">uine Language is that of the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>what &s;hall I render to the Lord for all his Benefits towards me?</HI> The grateful Per&s;on is not only led by a View of the divine Goodne&s;s, to mourn heartily over his Sins, as committed again&s;t &s;uch a gracious Bene|factor, and earne&s;tly to long after the Pro|&s;perity of his Kingdom, but likewi&s;e to la|bour hone&s;tly for Holine&s;s in him&s;elf and U&s;e|fulne&s;s to others, agreeable to his Station and Talents. It is true our great Benefactor is &s;elf-&s;ufficient, he neither needs, nor can receive, any Advantage from us, (immedi|ately)
<PB N="43" REF="006940_0042_102A9CC4B0CC5710">
In this re&s;pect <HI>our Goodne&s;s does not extend to him, neither is it any Gain to God, that we are righteous;</HI> yet in amazing Con|de&s;cen&s;ion to prevent our Ruin and pro|mote our Benefit, he who is all Fullne&s;s, will rather him&s;elf be &s;eemingly indigent, then permit us to be ungrateful, know|ing that our Performance of the Duty of Genero&s;ity is becoming the Dignity of our rational Nature, and conducive to our per&s;onal Comfort, and &s;ocial Happine&s;s; he clothes him&s;elf with his Peoples Wants and Mi&s;eries to invite our Beneficence, and graciou&s;ly accepts what is done to them as done to him&s;elf; he accounts it a &s;uitable Retaliation of his Kindne&s;&s;es, yea &s;uch a Favour as puts the great, the ble&s;&s;ed God in Debt, which he who is Truth it&s;elf, promi&s;&s;es to di&s;charge: <HI>He that hath Pitty on the Poor lendeth to the Lord, and that, which he hath given, he will pay him again; God is not unrighteous to forget your Work and Labour of Love, which ye have mini&s;tered to the Saints, and do mini&s;ter, for with &s;uch Sacrifices, he is well plea&s;ed.</HI> And when this Beneficence to our indigent Brethren, is de&s;igned to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in the nece&s;&s;ary and noble Attempt of erecting a Hou&s;e, <HI>not for Man, but for the Lord God;</HI> for his Glory and Wor&s;hip, and in Subordination thereto, the be&s;t Intere&s;ts of Mankind: This is a Charity of the mo&s;t &s;ublime and excellent Nature, not only becau&s;e it is extended

<P>Divine <HI>Providence</HI> prepar'd the Way for it, by a train of &s;urprizing incidents, long before any Thought of &s;uch an Event entered into any of our Hearts.

<P>The Truth is, divine Providence has ap|pear'd &s;urprizingly in the Cour&s;e and Series of this Tran&s;action, in In&s;tances two many now to enumerate; of which give me leave to mention the few following hints: We were brought at fir&s;t under a &s;udden, un|expected and urgent nece&s;&s;ity of endeavour|ing to get a Hou&s;e for our&s;elves to wor&s;hip

God in; the i&s;&s;ue of which, becau&s;e of the difficulty of the Enterprize, and the low State of the generality of our Society, ap|peared not only very doubtful and precari|ous, but without A&s;&s;i&s;tance from others, en|tirely impracticable; this of cour&s;e affected the Minds of &s;ome, who were concerned for its Pre&s;ervation, with fear and &s;olicitude con|cerning the Event; but it has plea&s;ed a gra|cious God by his Providence, in a great De|gree to di&s;&s;ipate our Fears, and to turn that which &s;eemed to threaten our total Di&s;&s;olution, into a probable Mean of e&s;tabli&s;hing the So|ciety for a long while to come!</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, my Brethren, I have ne|ver &s;een more of the glorious Sovereignty of divine Providence in any Ca&s;e, than in this: The Almighty in &s;ome In&s;tances mercifully di&s;concerted the Mea&s;ures we had form'd with a friendly Intention, in order to bring about for us a good we knew not: One Example of this kind, which I think it not impro|per to mention, is the fixing of the Place where the CHURCH now &s;tands; a <HI>Situation</HI> which in re&s;pect of <HI>free Air</HI> in the <HI>Summer, warmth</HI> in the <HI>Winter,</HI> and <HI>open pro&s;pect,</HI> is perhaps not inferior to any in the <HI>City;</HI> thro' a mi&s;taken view of things, we would have fixed it in a more expen&s;ive and le&s;s con|venient Place, but divine Providence would not &s;uffer it!</P>

Had it been deferred a little longer, the <HI>Stagnation</HI> of <HI>Trade,</HI> and its Con|&s;equents which &s;oon en&s;ued, would have ren|dered the Attempt abortive!</P>
<P>The Almighty frequently di&s;appointed us, as to our fond Expectations of the Libera|lity of fome, and graciou&s;ly rai&s;ed up others in their Place, of whom we had little or no Thought or Expectation!</P>

<P>And &s;till divine Goodne&s;s has been more con&s;picuous, in inclining many worthy <HI>Gen|tlemen</HI> of other <HI>Societies,</HI> more e&s;pecially in this <HI>City,</HI> to befriend and a&s;&s;i&s;t us with their generous Donations! <HI>Gentlemen</HI> of large and noble Souls, who are happily freed from the &s;lavi&s;h Shakles of &s;ordid <HI>Bigottry;</HI> who&s;e ge|nuine <HI>Charity</HI> is not confin'd to the mean Bu|&s;ine&s;s of a <HI>Party,</HI> but like the Sun diffu&s;es its Brightne&s;s and Benificence on all around them, who are in nece&s;&s;itous Circum&s;tances! without &s;uch, the Comfort of civil Society would quite expire, and every noble and dif|ficult Enterprize, of a religious kind, where

The Temple was not only the Place, but the medium of Wor&s;hip, &s;o that the Prayers made in or towards that Hou&s;e, had a &s;pecial Pro|mi&s;e of Acceptance, (2 <HI>Chron.</HI> vi. 21.) And hence it is &s;aid, that the Altar &s;anctify'd the Gift, (<HI>Mat.</HI> xxiii. 19.)

<P>No doubt Places, or Hou&s;es may be &s;eperated from a common and dedicated to a religious U&s;e; and this is all the Holine&s;s that they are now capable of.

&s;hewn as little Judgement of things, as of <HI>Gratitude</HI> to <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Man!</HI> Have they not hereby imitated the Unkindne&s;s of the murmuring <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> to <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> after all his painful and unwearied labours to promote their Benefit; which &s;o affected that meek Man of God, that he &s;peak unadvi&s;edly with his Lips; and no wonder, for Ingratitude in Return for important Benefits, is one of the mo&s;t dete&s;table Mon&s;ters in Nature, equally abhorent to all the Principles and Maxims of Rea&s;on, of Ju&s;tice, of Ingenuity and Honour!

<P>For my own Part, I freely and openly declare; that in my Opinion, there is not one Ornament more then is proper in this Structure; the Building is manly and plain, its chief Beauty is the Simplicity of the whole, and the ju&s;t Proportion of its &s;everal Parts, which are enlivned by the exactne&s;s of the Workman&s;hip, and a few Ornaments inter&s;per&s;ed, which are well devi&s;ed, well executed, and well placed; without, which

We are el&s;ewhere informed, that <HI>Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God, and that we cannot hear without a Preacher.</HI> The &s;ame Apo&s;tle like|wi&s;e in his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Ephe&s;ians</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, that the de&s;ign of Chri&s;ts giving publick Of|ficers and con&s;equently publick Ordinances to the Church, is her Edification, Knowledge, Unity, Stability, and Growth in all Good|ne&s;s: <HI>He gave &s;ome Apo&s;tles, &s;ome Prophets, &s;ome Evangeli&s;ts, and &s;ome Pa&s;tors and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the Work of the Mini&s;try, for the edifying of the Body of Chri&s;t, till we come all in the Unity of the Faith, and of the Knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect Man, unto the Mea&s;ure of the Stature of the Fullne&s;s of Chri&s;t, that we henceforth be no more Children to&s;&s;ed to and fro, and carried about with every Wind of Doctrine, by the Slight of Men, and cunning Craftine&s;s, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; but &s;peaking the Truth in Love, may grow up into him in all Things, which is the Head even Chri&s;t,</HI> and hence we are enjoined <HI>not to neglect the a&s;&s;embling of our &s;elves together, as the Manner of &s;ome is.</HI> And the enquiring Spou&s;e is directed <HI>to feed her Kids be&s;ides the Shepherds Tents.</HI></P>
