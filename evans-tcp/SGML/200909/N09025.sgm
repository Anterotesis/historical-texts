<P>On the eighth day of September. A. D. 1767 a con&s;iderable number of bapti&s;t mini&s;ters and brethren met at Warren in Rhode-Island Government to con&s;ult about the ex|pediency of an a&s;&s;ociation, and the manner of conducting it to the advantage of the churches. The i&s;&s;ue of the meeting was, Adopting the &s;entiments and plat-form of the we&s;tern a&s;&s;ociation; and thereon forming them&s;elves into a like body to be known by the name of the <HI>Warren A&s;&s;ociation.</HI> The churches that incorporated that year were the church of Warren, of Haverhil, of Bellingham and Middleborough. The next year four more joined them viz the church of Bo&s;ton, of Sutton, of Leice&s;ter and of Ware. This year 1769 four more were added viz the church of Sturbridge, of Enfield, of Wilbreham and of Montague.</P>

<HEAD>Sentiments touching an A&s;&s;ociation</HEAD>
<P N="1">1 That &s;uch a combination of churches is not only prudent but u&s;eful, as has appeared even in America by the experience of upwards of 60 years. Some of the u&s;es of it are&mdash;Union and communion among them&s;elves&mdash;maintaining more effectually the order and faith once deli|vered to the &s;aints&mdash;Having advice in ca&s;es of doubts, and help in di&s;tre&s;s. Being more able to promote the good of the cau&s;e&mdash;and becoming impor|tant in the eye of the civil powers, as has already appeared in many in|&s;tances on this continent 2. That &s;uch an a&s;&s;ociation is con&s;i&s;tent with the independency and power of particular churches, becau&s;e it pretends to be no other than an <HI>Advi&s;ory council,</HI> utterly di&s;claiming &s;uperiority, ju|risdiction, coercive right, and infallibility 3. That an a&s;&s;ociation &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of men knowing and judicious, particulary in the Scripture. The rea&s;ons are obvious; &s;uch men are the fitte&s;t to repre&s;ent communities who profe&s;s the Scriptures to be the only rule of faith and practice in re|ligious matters, and who expect that every advice, opinion, or direction they receive from an a&s;&s;ociation be &s;criptural. They &s;hould be &s;kilful and expert in the laws of their God as coun&s;ellors are in the laws of the land, for that is the ground of the churches application to them.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="plan">
<HEAD>Plan of the A&s;&s;ociation</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The a&s;&s;ociation to con&s;i&s;t only of me&s;&s;engers cho&s;en and &s;ent by the churches. The&s;e me&s;&s;engers to be their mini&s;ters (for a rea&s;on given in &s;entiment the 3,) together with &s;ome judicious brethren. Their expences to be borne by the churches which &s;end them.</P>
<P N="2">2, With the me&s;&s;engers the churches &s;end letters addre&s;&s;ed to the a&s;&s;o|ciation. In the&s;e letters mention is made of the names of the me&s;&s;engers, and their authority to act for their churches; al&s;o of the &s;tate of the churches touching their peace-their increa&s;e by bapti&s;m; and by letters di&s;mi&s;&s;ive &amp; commendatory from other churches&mdash;touching their diminution by death, excommunication, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ion to other churches, and the pre&s;ent number of members. If any que&s;tions are to be put to the a&s;&s;ociation&mdash;any advice to a&s;k&mdash;or bu&s;ine&s;s to propo&s;e, the&s;e are to be expre&s;&s;ed in &s;aid letters.</P>
<P N="3">3. All matters to be determined in this a&s;&s;ociation by the &s;uffrage of the
<PB N="4" REF="011519_0004_0F86F5C5C674B1D8">
me&s;&s;engers, except what are determinable by Scripture&mdash; &s;uch matters are never put to the deci&s;ion of votes. All that &s;peak are to addre&s;s the mo|derator, who is to take care that none be interrupted while &s;peaking, and that no other indecorum take place.</P>
<P N="4">4. Churches are to be received into this a&s;&s;ociation by petitions, &s;etting forth their de&s;ire to be admitted&mdash;their faith&mdash;order&mdash; and willingne&s;s to be conformable to the rules of the a&s;&s;ociated body. When a petition is read, and the matter ripened for a vote; the moderator &s;tates the que&s;tion, &s;uffrage being given in favour of the petition, the &s;aid moderator declares that &s;uch a church is received into the a&s;&s;ociation, in token of which he gives the me&s;&s;engers the <HI>right hand of fellow&s;hip,</HI> and bids them take their &s;eats.</P>
<P N="4">4. The a&s;&s;ociation to meet annually at Warren on Tue&s;day next after the fir&s;t Wednesday in September at two a clock in the afternoon; and to continue till bu&s;ine&s;s be fini&s;hed. It is to be opened with divine &s;er|vice&mdash;after which a moderator and clerk are cho&s;en&mdash;the letters from the churches are read&mdash;the names of the me&s;&s;engers are written, that they may be called over at after meetings&mdash;then bu&s;ine&s;s is attended to, and mi|nutes thereof made&mdash;A circular letter to the churches is prepared and &s;ign|ed, and a copy of it &s;ent to every church, containing the minutes of the a&s;&s;ociation; the &s;tates of the churches; when and by whom vacancies are to be &s;upplied; who to preach the next a&s;&s;ociation &s;ermon, and whatever el&s;e is needful for the churches to know.</P>
<P N="5">5. A connexion to be formed and maintained between this a&s;&s;ociation and that of Philadelphia by annual letter and me&s;&s;engers from us to them and from them to us.</P>
<P N="6">6. The faith and order of this a&s;&s;ociation are expre&s;&s;ed in a confe&s;&s;ion put forth by upwards of a hundred congregations (in Great Britain) in the year 1689; and adopted by the a&s;&s;ociation of Philadelphia in 1742. Some of the principles in &s;aid confe&s;&s;ion are&mdash;The imputation of Adam's &s;in to his po&s;terity &mdash; The inability of man to recover him&s;elf&mdash;Effectual calling by &s;overeign grace&mdash;Ju&s;tification by imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s&mdash;Im|mer&s;ion for bapti&s;m, and that on profe&s;&s;ion of faith and repentance&mdash;Con+gregational churches, and their independency&mdash;Reception into them upon evidence of &s;ound conver&s;ion &amp;c.</P>
