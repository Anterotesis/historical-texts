<HEAD><HI>OBSERVATIONS, &amp;c.</HI> Of the <HI>IMPORTANCE</HI> of the <HI>REVOLUTION</HI> which has e&s;tabli&s;hed the Independence of the United States.</HEAD>
<P>_HAVING, from pure conviction, taken a warm part in favour of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> colonies (now the United States of America) during the late war; and been expo&s;ed, in con&s;equence of this, to <HI>much</HI> abu&s;e and <HI>&s;ome</HI> danger; it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed that I have been waiting for the i&s;&s;ue with anxiety&mdash;I am thankful that my anxiety is removed; and that I have been &s;pared to be a witne&s;s to that very i&s;&s;ue of the war which has been all along the object of my wi&s;hes. With heart-felt &s;atisfaction, I &s;ee the revo|lution in favour of univer&s;al liberty which has taken place in <HI>America;</HI>&mdash;a revolution which opens a new pro&s;pect in human affairs, and begins a new aera in the hi&s;tory of man|kind;
<PB N="4" REF="018739_0004_0FA81C5E99EAEB10">
&mdash;a revolution by which <HI>Britons</HI> them|&s;elves will be the greate&s;t gainers, if wi&s;e enough to improve properly the check that has been given to the de&s;poti&s;m of their mi|ni&s;ters, and to catch the flame of virtuous li|berty which has &s;aved their American brethren.</P>
<P>The late war, in its <HI>commencement</HI> and <HI>pro|gre&s;s,</HI> did great good by di&s;&s;eminating ju&s;t &s;en|timents of the rights of mankind, and the na|ture of legitimate government; by exciting a &s;pirit of re&s;i&s;tance &s;o tyranny, which has eman|cipated one <HI>European</HI> country, and is likely to emancipate others; and by occa&s;ioning the e&s;tabli&s;hment in <HI>America</HI> of forms of govern|ment more equitable and more liberal than any that the world has yet known. But, in its <HI>termination,</HI> the war has done &s;till greater good by pre&s;erving the new governments from that de&s;truction in which they mu&s;t have been involved, had Britain conquered; by provid|ing, in a &s;eque&s;tered continent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of many &s;ingular advantages, a place of refuge for oppre&s;t men in every region of the world; and by laying the foundation there of an em|pire which may be the &s;eat of liberty, &s;cience and virtue, and from whence there is rea&s;on to hope the&s;e &s;acred ble&s;&s;ings will &s;pread, till they become univer&s;al and the time arrives when kings and prie&s;ts &s;hall have no more power to oppre&s;s, and that ignominious &s;la|very which has hitherto deba&s;ed the world is
<PB N="5" REF="018739_0005_0FA81C5F541835F8">
exterminated. I therefore, think I &s;ee the hand of Providence in the late war working for the general good; and can &s;carcely avoid crying out, <HI>It was the Lord's doing.</HI></P>
<P>Rea&s;on, as well as tradition and revelati|on, lead us to expect that a more improved and happy &s;tate of human affairs will take place before the con&s;umination of all things. The world has hitherto been gradually im|proving. Light and knowledge have been gaining ground, and human life <HI>at pre&s;ent,</HI> compared with what it <HI>once</HI> was, is much the &s;ame that a youth approaching to manhood is compared with an infant.</P>
<P>Such are the natures of things that this progre&s;s mu&s;t continue. During particular intervals it may be interrupted, but it cannot be de&s;troy'd. Every pre&s;ent advance pre|pares the way for farther advances; and a &s;ingle experiment or di&s;covery may &s;ome|times give ri&s;e to &s;o many more as &s;uddenly to rai&s;e the &s;pecies higher, and to re&s;emble the effects of opening a new &s;en&s;e, or of the fall of a &s;park on a train that &s;prings a mine. For this rea&s;on, mankind may at la&s;t arrive at degrees of improvement which we cannot now even &s;u&s;pect to be po&s;&s;ible. A dark age may follow an enlightened age; but, in this ca&s;e, the light, after being &s;mothered for a time, will break out again with a brighter lu&s;tre.
<PB N="6" REF="018739_0006_0FA81C608B993D00">
The pre&s;ent age of increa&s;ed light, con&s;idered as &s;ucceeding the ages of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> and an intermediate period of thick darkne&s;s, fur|ni&s;hes a proof of the truth of this ob&s;ervation. There are certain kinds of improvement which, when once made, cannot be entirely lo&s;t. During the dark ages, the improvements made in the ages that preceded them remain|ed &s;o far as to be recovered immediately at the re&s;urrection of letters, and to produce after|wards that more rapid progre&s;s in improve|ment which has di&s;tingui&s;hed modern times.</P>
<P>There can &s;carcely be a more plea&s;ing and encouraging object of reflection than this. An accidental ob&s;ervation of the effects of gravity in a garden has been the means of di&s;|covering the laws that govern the &s;olar &s;y&s;|tem<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This refers to an account given of Sir I&s;aac Newton, in the Preface to Dr. PEMBERTON'S View of his Philo&s;ophy.</NOTE>, and of enabling us to look down with pity on the ignorance of the mo&s;t enlightened times among the antients. What new digni|ty has been given to man, and what additions have been made to his powers, by the inven|tion of optical gla&s;&s;es, printing, gun-powder, &amp;c. and by the late di&s;coveries in navigation, mathematics, natural philo&s;ophy, &amp;c.?</P>
<P>But among the events in modern times tend|ing to the elevation of mankind, there are none
<PB N="7" REF="018739_0007_0FA81C611ACAD360">
probably of &s;o much con&s;equence as the re|cent one which occa&s;ions the&s;e ob&s;ervations. Perhaps, I do not go too far when I &s;ay that, next to the introduction of Chri&s;tianity among mankind, the American revolution may prove the mo&s;t important &s;tep in the progre&s;&s;ive cour&s;e of human improvement. It is an event which may produce a general diffu&s;ion of the principles of humanity, and become the means of &s;etting free mankind from the &s;hack|les of &s;uper&s;tition and tyranny, by leading them to &s;ee and know <Q>that nothing is <HI>fun|damental</HI> but impartial enquiry, an hone&s;t mind, and virtuous practice&mdash;that &s;tate policy ought not to be applied to the &s;up|port of &s;peculative opinions and formula|ries of faith.</Q>&mdash;<Q>That the members of a civil community are <HI>confederates,</HI> not <HI>&s;ub|jects;</HI> and their rulers, <HI>&s;ervants,</HI> not <HI>ma&s;ters.</HI> &mdash;And that all legitimate government con&s;i&s;ts in the dominion of equal laws made with common con&s;ent; that is, in the do|minion of men over <HI>them&s;elves;</HI> and not in the dominion of communities over commu|nities, or of any men over other men.</Q></P>
<P>Happy will the world be when the&s;e truths &s;hall be every where acknowledged and prac|ti&s;ed upon. Religious bigotry, that cruel demon, will be then laid a&s;leep. Slavi&s;h go|vernments and &s;lavi&s;h Hierarchies will then
<PB N="8" REF="018739_0008_0FA81C619BA6DB80">
&s;ink&punc; and the old prophecies be verified, <Q>that the la&s;t univer&s;al empire upon earth &s;hall be the empire of rea&s;on and virtue, under which the go&s;pel of peace (better under&s;tood) <HI>&s;hall have free cour&s;e and be glo|rified, many will run to and fro and knowledge be increa&s;ed, the wolf dwell with the lamb and the leopard with the kid, and nation no more lift up a &s;word again&s;t nation.</HI></Q></P>
<P>It is a conviction I cannot re&s;i&s;t, that the in|dependence of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> colonies in Ameri|ca is one of the &s;teps ordained by Providence to introduce the&s;e times; and I can &s;carcely be deceived in this conviction, if the United States &s;hould e&s;cape &s;ome dangers which threaten them, and will take proper care to throw them&s;elves open to future improve|ments, and to make the mo&s;t of the advantages of their pre&s;ent &s;ituation. Should this happen, it will be true of them as it was of the people of the Jews, that <HI>in them all the families of the earth &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed.</HI> It is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible they &s;hould think too highly of their own con&s;e|quence. Perhaps, there never exi&s;ted a peo|ple on who&s;e wi&s;dom and virtue more depend|ed: or to whom a &s;tation of more importance in the plan of Providence has been a&s;&s;igned. They have begun nobly. They have fought with &s;ucce&s;s for them&s;elves and for the world; and, in the mid&s;t of inva&s;ion and carnage, e&s;|tabli&s;hed

forms of government favourable in the highe&s;t degree to the rights of mankind. &mdash;But they have much more to do; more indeed than it is po&s;&s;ible properly to repre&s;ent. In this addre&s;s, my de&s;ign is only to take no|tice of a few <HI>great</HI> points which &s;eem particu|larly to require their attention, in order to render them permanently happy in them&s;elves and u&s;eful to mankind. On the&s;e points, I &s;hall deliver my &s;entiments with freedom, con&s;cious I mean well; but, at the &s;ame time, with real diffidence, con&s;cious of my own lia|blene&s;s to error.</P>

<P>IT &s;eems evident, that what fir&s;t requires the attention of the United States is the redemption of their debts, and making com|pen&s;ation to that army which has carried them through the war. They have an infant cre|dit to cheri&s;h and rear, which, if this is not done, mu&s;t peri&s;h, and with it their character and honour for ever. Nor is it conceivable they &s;hould meet with any great difficulties in doing this. They have a va&s;t re&s;ource peculiar to them&s;elves, in a continent of un|located
<PB N="10" REF="018739_0010_0FA81C6344EFA048">
lands po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing every advantage of &s;oil and climate. The &s;ettlement of the&s;e lands will be rapid, the con&s;equence of which mu&s;t be a rapid increa&s;e of their value. By di&s;po&s;ing of them to the army and to emi|grants, the greate&s;t part of the debts of the United States may probably be &s;unk <HI>imme|diately.</HI> But had they no &s;uch re&s;ource, they are very capable of bearing taxes &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e of a gradual redemption. Suppo&s;ing their debts to amount to <HI>nine milli|ons</HI> &s;terling, carrying intere&s;t at 5&frac12; <HI>per cent.</HI> taxes producing a revenue of a million <HI>per ann.</HI> would pay the intere&s;t, and at the &s;ame time leave a <HI>&s;urplus</HI> of <HI>half</HI> a million <HI>per ann.</HI> for a <HI>&s;inking fund,</HI> which would di&s;charge the principal in thirteen years. A &s;urplus of a <HI>quarter</HI> of a million would do the &s;ame in 20&frac12; years. After di&s;charging the principal, the appropriated revenue being no longer wanted, might be aboli&s;hed, and the States ea&s;ed of the burden of it. But it would be impru|dent to aboli&s;h it entirely. 100,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> <HI>per ann.</HI> re&s;erved, and faithfully laid out in clear|ing unlocated lands and other improvements, would in a &s;hort time increa&s;e to a trea&s;ure (or continental patrimony) which would de|fray the whole expenditure of the union, and keep the States free from debts and taxes for

It is well for this kingdom that the extravagance of the crown has been the means of alien|ating this patrimony, for the con&s;equence has been making the crown dependent on the people. But in America &s;uch a patrimony would be <HI>continental</HI> property capable of being applied only to public purpo&s;es, in the way which the pub|lic (or its delegates) &s;hould approve.</NOTE>. Such a <HI>re&s;erve</HI> would (&s;uppo&s;ing it improved &s;o as to produce a profit of 5 <HI>per cent.</HI>) increa&s;e to a capital of three millions in 19 years, 30 millions in 57 years, 100 milli|ons in 81 years, and 261 millions in 100 years. But &s;uppo&s;ing it capable of being improved &s;o as to produce a profit of 10 <HI>per cent.</HI> it would increa&s;e to five millions in 19 years, 100 millions in 49 years, and 10,000 millions in 97 years.</P>
<P>It is wonderful that no &s;tate has yet thought of taking this method to make it&s;elf great and rich. The &s;malle&s;t appropriation in a &s;inking fund, <HI>never diverted,</HI> operates in cancelling debts, ju&s;t as money increa&s;es at compound intere&s;t; and is, therefore, <HI>omnipotent</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One penny put out at our Saviour's birth to 5 <HI>per cent.</HI> compound intere&s;t would, before this time, have increa&s;ed to a greater &s;um than would be contained in TWO HUNDRED MILLIONS of EARTHS all &s;olid gold. But, if put out to <HI>&s;imple</HI> intere&s;t, it would have amounted to no more than <HI>&s;even &s;hillings and &s;ix pence.</HI> All governments which alienate <HI>funds</HI> de&s;tined for reimbur&s;ements, chu&s;e to improve money in the <HI>la&s;t</HI> rather than the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of the&s;e ways.</NOTE>. But,

if <HI>diverted,</HI> it lo&s;es all its power. BRITAIN affords a &s;triking proof of this. Its &s;inking fund (once the hope of the kingdom) has, by the practice of alienating it, been render|ed impotent and u&s;ele&s;s. Had it been in|violably applied to the purpo&s;e for which it was intended, there would in the year 1775, have been a <HI>&s;urplus</HI> in the revenue of more than five millions <HI>per ann.</HI> But in&s;tead of this, we were then encumbered with a debt of 137 millions, carrying an intere&s;t of near 4&frac12; mil|lions, and leaving no &s;urplus of any con&s;e|quence. This debt has been &s;ince increa&s;ed to 280 millions, carrying an intere&s;t (inclu|ding expences of management) of <HI>nine</HI> millions and a half.&mdash;A mon&s;trous bubble;&mdash;and as no effectual mea&s;ures are likely to be taken (or perhaps <HI>can now</HI> be taken) for reducing it within the limits of &s;afety, it mu&s;t, &s;ome time or other, produce a dreadful convul&s;ion. Let the United States take warning&mdash;Their debts at pre&s;ent are moderate. A Sinking fund, guarded <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When not thus guarded, public funds become the wor&s;t evils, by giving to the rulers of &s;tates a command of reve|nue for the purpo&s;es of corruption.</NOTE> again&s;t mi&s;application, may &s;oon extingui&s;h them, and prove a re&s;ource in all events of the greate&s;t importance. Let &s;uch a fund be e&s;tabli&s;hed. Could a &s;acredne&s;s be given it like that of the ark of God among the Jews, it would do the &s;ame &s;ervice.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="018739_0013_0FA81C6850E5BEA0">I mu&s;t not, however, forget that there is ONE of their debts on which no &s;inking fund can have any effect; and which it is impo&s;&s;i|ble for them to di&s;charge:&mdash;A debt, greater, perhaps, than has been ever due from any country; and which will be deeply felt by their late&s;t po&s;terity.&mdash;But it is a debt of GRATITUDE only&mdash;Of GRATITUDE to that General, who has been rai&s;ed up by Provi|dence to make them free and independent, and who&s;e name mu&s;t &s;hine among the fir&s;t in the future annals of the benefactors of man|kind.</P>
<P>The mea&s;ure now propo&s;ed may pre&s;erve America for ever from too great an accumu|lation of debts; and, con&s;equently, of taxes &mdash;an evil which is likely to be the ruin not only of <HI>Britain,</HI> but of other <HI>European</HI> States. &mdash;But there are mea&s;ures of yet greater con|&s;equence, which I wi&s;h ardently to recommend and inculcate.</P>
<P>For the &s;ake of mankind, I wi&s;h to &s;ee every mea&s;ure adopted that can have a tendency to pre&s;erve PEACE in America; and to make it an open and fair &s;tage for di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and the &s;eat of PERFECT LIBERTY.</P>

<HEAD>Of <HI>PEACE,</HI> And the Means of perpetuating it.</HEAD>
<P>CIVIL Government is an expedient for col|lecting the wi&s;dom and the force of a community or confederacy, to pre&s;erve its peace and liberty again&s;t every ho&s;tile inva|&s;ion, whether from <HI>within</HI> or from <HI>without.</HI>&mdash; In the latter of the&s;e re&s;pects, the United States are happily &s;ecured; but they are far from being equally happy in the <HI>former</HI> re|&s;pect. Having now, in con&s;equence of their &s;ucce&s;sful re&s;i&s;tance of the inva&s;ion of <HI>Britain,</HI> united to their remotene&s;s from <HI>Europe,</HI> no external enemy to fear, they are in danger of fighting with one another.&mdash;This is their <HI>greate&s;t</HI> danger; and providing &s;ecurities again&s;t it is their <HI>harde&s;t</HI> work. Should they fail in this, America may &s;ome time or other be turned into a &s;cene of blood; and in&s;tead of being the hope and refuge of the world, may become a terror to it.</P>
<P>When a di&s;pute ari&s;es among <HI>individuals</HI> in a State, an appeal is made to a <HI>court</HI> of law; that is, to the wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice of the State. The court decides. The lo&s;ing par|ty acquie&s;ces; or, if he does not, the power of the State <HI>forces</HI> him to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and thus the effects of contention are &s;uppre&s;t, and peace is maintained.&mdash;In a way &s;imilar
<PB N="15" REF="018739_0015_0FA81C69D290E630">
to this, peace may be maintained between any number of confederated States; and I can al|mo&s;t imagine, that it is not impo&s;&s;ible but that by &s;ome &s;uch means <HI>univer&s;al</HI> peace may &s;ome time or other be produced, and all war excluded from the world.&mdash;Why may we not hope to &s;ee this begun in America?&mdash;The articles of confederation make con&s;iderable advances towards it. When a di&s;pute ari&s;es between any of the States, they order an ap|peal to Congre&s;s&mdash;an enquiry by Congre&s;s,&mdash; a hearing,&mdash;and a deci&s;ion.&mdash;But here they &s;top.&mdash;What is mo&s;t of all nece&s;&s;ary is omit|ted. No provi&s;ion is made for enforcing the deci&s;ions of Congre&s;s; and this renders them inefficient and &s;utile. I am by no means qualified to point out the be&s;t method of re|moving this defect. Much mu&s;t be given up for this purpo&s;e, nor is it ea&s;y to give up <HI>too</HI> much. Without all doubt the powers of Congre&s;s mu&s;t be enlarged. In particular, a power mu&s;t be given it to collect, on certain emergencies, the force of the confederacy, and to employ it in carrying its deci&s;ions in|to execution. A State again&s;t which a de|ci&s;ion is made, will yield of cour&s;e when it knows that &s;uch a force exi&s;ts, and that it allows no hope from re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>By this force I do not mean a STANDING ARMY. God forbid, that &s;tanding armies &s;hould ever find an e&s;tabli&s;hment in America!
<PB N="16" REF="018739_0016_0FA81C6B07991568">
They are every where the grand &s;upports of arbitrary power, and the chief cau&s;es of the depre&s;&s;ion of mankind. No wi&s;e people will tru&s;t their defence out of their own hands, or con&s;ent to hold their rights at the mercy of armed <HI>&s;laves.</HI> Free States ought to be bodies of armed <HI>citizens,</HI> well regulated, and well di&s;ciplined, and always ready to turn out, when properly called upon, to execute the laws, to quell riots, and to keep the peace. Such, if I am rightly informed, are the citi|zens of America. Why then may not CON|GRESS be furni&s;hed with a power of calling out from the confederated States, <HI>quotas</HI> of <HI>militia</HI> &s;ufficient to force at once the com|pliance of any State which may &s;hew an in|clination to break the union by re&s;i&s;ting its deci&s;ions?</P>
<P>I am very &s;en&s;ible that it will be difficult to guard &s;uch a power again&s;t abu&s;e; and, per|haps, better means of an&s;wering this end are di&s;coverable. In human affairs, however, the choice generally offered us is "of two evils to take the lea&s;t." We chu&s;e the re|&s;traint of civil government, becau&s;e a le&s;s evil than anarchy; and, in like manner, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, the danger of the abu&s;e of power, and of its being employed &s;ometimes to enforce wrong deci&s;ions, mu&s;t be &s;ub|mitted to, becau&s;e a le&s;s evil than the mi&s;ery
<PB N="17" REF="018739_0017_0FA81C6BA5FFB4F8">
of inte&s;tine wars. Much, however, may be done to le&s;&s;en this danger. Such regulations as tho&s;e in the ninth of the articles of con&s;e|deration will, in a great mea&s;ure, prevent ha&s;ty and partial deci&s;ions. The rotation e&s;|tabli&s;hed by the fifth article will prevent that corruption of character which &s;eldom fails to be produced by the long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of power; and the right re&s;erved to every State of re|calling its Delegates when di&s;&s;atisfied with them, will keep them con&s;tantly re&s;pon&s;ible and cautious.</P>

<P>IT is a common opinion, that there are &s;ome doctrines &s;o &s;acred, and others of &s;o bad a tendency, that no public di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of them ought to be allowed.

<P>All the experience of pa&s;t time proves that the con&s;equence of allowing civil power to judge of the nature and tendency of doctrines, mu&s;t be making it a hindrance to the pro|gre&s;s of truth, and an enemy to the improve|ment of the world.</P>

<P>When men a&s;&s;ociate for the purpo&s;e of ci|vil government, they do it not to defend truth, or to &s;upport formularies of faith and &s;peculative opinions; but to defend their ci|vil rights, and to protect one another in the free exerci&s;e of their mental and corporeal powers. The interference, therefore, of civil authority in &s;uch ca&s;es is directly contrary to the end of its in&s;titution. The way in which it can be&s;t promote the intere&s;t and dignity of mankind, (as far as they can be promoted by the di&s;covery of truth) is, by encouraging them to &s;earch for truth wherever they can find it; and by protecting them in doing this again&s;t the attacks of malevolence and bigotry. Should any attempt be made by contending &s;ects to injure one another, its power will come in properly to cru&s;h the at|tempt, and to maintain for all &s;ects equal li|berty, by puni&s;hing every encroachment up|on it.

<P>But what I wi&s;h mo&s;t to urge is the tenden|cy of religious e&s;tabli&s;hments to impede the improvement of the world. They are boun|daries pre&s;cribed by human folly to human inve&s;tigation; and inclo&s;ures which intercept the light and confine the exertions of rea&s;on. Let any one imagine to him&s;elf what effects &s;imilar e&s;tabli&s;hments would have in Philo|&s;ophy, Navigation, Metaphy&s;icks, Medicine or Mathematicks. Something like this took place in Logick and Philo&s;ophy; while the
<PB N="33" REF="018739_0033_0FA81C7A5A4017C0">
IPSE DIXIT of Ari&s;totle and the non&s;en&s;e or the &s;chools maintained an authority like that of the creeds of churchmen: And the effect was a longer continuance of the world in the ignorance and barbarity of the dark ages. But civil e&s;tabli&s;hments of religion are <HI>more</HI> pernicious. So apt are mankind to mi&s;repre|&s;ent the character of the Deity, and to connect his favour with particular modes of faith, that it mu&s;t be expected, that a religion &s;o &s;ettled will be what it has hitherto been&mdash;a gloomy and cruel &s;uper&s;tition bearing the name of religion.</P>
<P>It has been long a &s;ubject of di&s;pute, which is wor&s;t in its effects on &s;ociety, <HI>&s;uch</HI> a religion or &s;peculative Athei&s;m. For my own part, I could almo&s;t give the preference to the latter. &mdash;ATHEISM is &s;o repugnant to every principle of common &s;en&s;e, that it is not po&s;&s;ible it &s;hould ever gain much ground, or become very pre|valent. On the contrary; there is a par|ticular pronene&s;s in the human mind to SU|PERSTITION, and nothing is more likely to become prevalent.&mdash;ATHEISM leaves us to the full influence of mo&s;t of our natural feel|ings and &s;ocial principles; and the&s;e are &s;o &s;trong in their operation, that in general they are a &s;ufficient guard to the order of &s;ociety. But SUPERSTITION counteracts the&s;e princi|ples, by holding forth men to one another as objects of divine hatred; and by putting them
<PB N="34" REF="018739_0034_0FA81C7B5962FE30">
on harra&s;&s;ing, &s;ilencing, impri&s;oning and burn|ing one another in order to do God &s;ervice.&mdash; ATHEISM is a &s;anctuary for vice by taking away the motives to virtue ari&s;ing from the will of God and the fear of a future judgment. But SUPERSTITION is more a &s;anctuary for vice, by teaching men ways of plea&s;ing God without moral virtue, and by leading them even to compound for wickedne&s;s by <HI>ritual</HI> &s;ervices, by bodily penances and mortificati|ons, by adoring &s;hrines, going pilgrimages, &s;aying many prayers, receiving ab&s;olution from the prie&s;t, exterminating heretics, &amp;c.&mdash; ATHEISM de&s;troys the &s;acredne&s;s and obliga|tion of an oath. But is there not al&s;o a reli|gion (&s;o called) which does this, by teaching that there is a power which can di&s;pen&s;e with the obligation of oaths, that <HI>pious</HI> frauds are right, and that faith is not to be kept with heretics?</P>
<P>It is indeed only a rational and liberal reli|gion; a religion founded on ju&s;t notions of the Deity as a being who regards equally eve|ry &s;incere wor&s;hipper, and by whom all are alike favoured as far as they act up to the light they enjoy; a religion which con&s;i&s;ts in the imitation of the moral perfections of an almighty but benevolent Governor of nature who directs for the be&s;t all events, in confi|dence in the care of his providence, in re&s;ig|nation to his will, and in the faithful di&s;charge
<PB N="35" REF="018739_0035_0FA81C7BD618B148">
of every duty of piety and morality from a regard to his authority and the apprehen&s;ion of a future righteous retribution.&mdash;It is only THIS religion (the in&s;piring principle of eve|ry thing fair and worthy and joyful, and which in truth is nothing but the love of God and man and virtue warming the heart and di|recting the conduct.)&mdash;It is only THIS kind of religion that can ble&s;s the world, or be an advantage to &s;ociety.&mdash;This is the religion that every enlightened friend to mankind will be zealous to promote. But it is a religion that the powers of the world know little of, and which will always be be&s;t promoted by being left free and open.</P>
<P>I cannot help adding here, that this is in particular the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> religion.&mdash;Chri&s;tia|nity teaches us that there is none good but one, that is, God; that he willeth all men to be &s;aved, and will puni&s;h nothing but wick|edne&s;s; that he de&s;ires mercy and not &s;acri|fice (benevolence rather than rituals); that loving him with all our hearts, and loving our neighbour as our&s;elves, is the whole of our duty; and that in every nation he that feareth him and worketh righteou&s;ne&s;s is ac|cepted of him. It re&s;ts its authority on the power of God, not of man; refers it&s;elf entirely to the under&s;tandings of men; makes us the &s;ubjects of a kingdom that is not of this world! and requires us to elevate our minds
<PB N="36" REF="018739_0036_0FA81C7C8DDFAE78">
above temporal emoluments, and to look forwards to a &s;tate beyond the grave, where a government of perfect virtue will be erected under that Me&s;&s;iah who has <HI>ta&s;ted death for every man.</HI>&mdash;What have the powers of the world to do with &s;uch a religion?&mdash;It di&s;|claims all connexion with them; it made its way at fir&s;t in oppo&s;ition to them; and, as far as it is now upheld by them, it is di&s;ho|noured and vilified.</P>
<P>The injury which civil e&s;tabli&s;hments do to Chri&s;tianity may be learnt from the fol|lowing con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. The &s;pirit of religious e&s;tabli&s;h|ments is oppo&s;ite to the &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity. It is a &s;pirit of pride and tyranny in oppo&s;iti|on to the Chri&s;tian <HI>lowly</HI> &s;pirit; a contracted and &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit, in oppo&s;ition to the Chri&s;tian enlarged and benevolent &s;pirit; the &s;pirit of the world in oppo&s;ition to the Chri&s;tian <HI>hea|venly</HI> &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Secondly. Religious e&s;tabli&s;hments are founded on a claim of authority in the Chri&s;|tian church which overthrows Chri&s;t's autho|rity. He has in the &s;criptures given his follow|ers a code of laws, to which he requires them to adhere as their <HI>only</HI> guide. But the language of the framers of church e&s;tabli&s;hments is <Q>We <HI>have authority in controver&s;ies of faith and power.
<PB N="37" REF="018739_0037_0FA81C7DC391A2A0">
to decree rites and ceremonies.</HI> We are the de|puties of Chri&s;t upon earth, who have been commi&s;&s;ioned by him to interpret his laws, and to rule his church. You mu&s;t there|fore follow us. The &s;criptures are in&s;uffi|cient. Our interpretations you mu&s;t receive as Chri&s;t's laws; our creeds as <HI>his</HI> doctrine; our inventions as <HI>his</HI> in&s;titutions.</Q></P>
<P>It is evident, as the excellent HOADLY has &s;hewn, that the&s;e claims turn Chri&s;t out of the government of his own kingdom, and place u&s;urpers on his throne.&mdash;They are therefore derogatory to his honour; and a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to them is a breach of the allegiance due to him. They have been almo&s;t fatal to true Chri&s;tianity; and attempts to enforce them by civil penalties, have watered the Chri&s;tian world with the blood of &s;aints and martyrs.</P>
<P>Thirdly. The difficulty of introducing alterations into church e&s;tabli&s;hments after they have been once formed, is another ob|jection to them. Hence it happens, that they remain always the &s;ame amid&s;t all changes of public manners and opinions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is an inconvenience attending <HI>civil</HI> as well as <HI>ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hments, which has been with great wi&s;dom guarded again&s;t in the new <HI>American</HI> con&s;titutions, by ap|pointing that there &s;hall be a revi&s;al of them at the end of certain terms. This will leave them always open to im|provement, without any danger of tho&s;e convul&s;ions which have u&s;ually attended the corrections of abu&s;es when they have acquired a &s;acredne&s;s by time.</NOTE>; and that a
<PB N="38" REF="018739_0038_0FA81C7E5A3B4948">
kingdom may go on for ages in idolatrous wor&s;hip, after a general conviction has taken place, that there is but one object of religious wor&s;hip, namely, <HI>the God and Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> What a &s;ad &s;cene of reli|gious hypocri&s;y mu&s;t &s;uch a di&s;cordance be|tween public conviction and the public forms produce? At this day in &s;ome <HI>European</HI> coun|tries, the ab&s;urdity and &s;lavi&s;hne&s;s of their hierarchies are &s;een and acknowledged; but being incorporated with the &s;tate, it is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to get rid of them.</P>
<P>What can be more &s;triking than the State of <HI>England</HI> in this re&s;pect?&mdash;The &s;y&s;tem of faith and wor&s;hip e&s;tabli&s;hed in it was formed above two hundred years ago, when <HI>Europe</HI> was ju&s;t emerging from darkne&s;s and barbarity. The times have ever &s;ince been growing more enlightened; but without any effect on the e&s;tabli&s;hment. Not a ray of the increa&s;ing light has penetrated it. Not one imperfection, however gro&s;s, has been removed. The &s;ame articles of faith are &s;ub&s;cribed. The &s;ame ritual of devotion is practi&s;ed.&mdash;There is rea|&s;on to fear that the <HI>ab&s;olution of the &s;ick</HI> which forms a part of this ritual, is often re&s;orted to as a pa&s;&s;port to heaven after a wicked life; and yet it is continued.&mdash;Perhaps nothing more &s;hocking to rea&s;on and humanity ever made a part of a religious &s;y&s;tem than the damning clau&s;es in the <HI>Athana&s;ian</HI> creed; and yet the obligation of the clergy to declare a&s;&s;ent to
<PB N="39" REF="018739_0039_0FA81C7F201EF620">
this creed, and to read it as a part of the public devotion, remains.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of &s;uch a &s;tate of things is, that,</P>
<P>Fourthly, Chri&s;tianity it&s;elf is di&s;graced, and that all religion comes to be con&s;idered as a &s;tate trick, and a barbarous mummery. It is well known, that in &s;ome Popi&s;h countries there are few Chri&s;tians among the higher ranks of men, the religion of the State being in tho&s;e countries <HI>mi&s;taken</HI> for the religion of the Go&s;pel. This indeed &s;hews a criminal in|attention in tho&s;e who fall into &s;uch a mi&s;take; for they ought to con&s;ider that Chri&s;tianity has been grievou&s;ly corrupted, and that their ideas of it &s;hould be taken from the New-Te&s;tament only. It is, however, &s;o natural to reckon Chri&s;tianity to be that which it is held out to be in all the e&s;tabli&s;hments of it, that it cannot but happen that &s;uch an error will take place and produce &s;ome of the wor&s;t con&s;equences.&mdash;There is probably a grea|ter number of rational Chri&s;tians (that is, of Chri&s;tians upon enquiry) in <HI>England,</HI> than in all Popi&s;h countries. The rea&s;on is, that the religious e&s;tabli&s;hment here is Popery <HI>reform|ed;</HI> and that a con&s;iderable body di&s;&s;ent from it, and are often inculcating the nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;tingui&s;hing between the Chri&s;tianity e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by law and that which is taught in the
<PB N="40" REF="018739_0040_0FA81C7FC7970228">
Bible.&mdash;Certain it is, that till this di&s;tinc|tion is made, Chri&s;tianity can never recover its ju&s;t credit and u&s;efulne&s;s.</P>
<P>Such then are the effects of civil e&s;tabli&s;h|ments of religion. May heaven &s;oon put an end to them. The world will never be generally wi&s;e or virtuous or happy, till the&s;e enemies to its peace and improvement are demoli&s;hed. Thanks be to God they are giving way before increa&s;ing light. Let them never &s;hew them|&s;elves in America. Let no &s;uch mon&s;ter be known there as HUMAN AUTHORITY IN MAT|TERS OF RELIGION. Let every hone&s;t and peaceable man, whatever is his faith, be pro|tected there; and find an effectual defence again&s;t the attacks of bigotry and intolerance. In the United States may RELIGION flouri&s;h. They cannot be very great and happy if it does not. But let it be a better religion than mo&s;t of tho&s;e which have been hitherto pro|fe&s;&s;ed in the world. Let it be a religion which enforces moral obligations; not a re|ligion which relaxes and evades them.&mdash;A tolerant and <HI>Catholic</HI> religion; not a rage for pro&s;eliti&s;m.&mdash;A religion of peace and cha|rity; not a religion that per&s;ecutes, cur&s;es and damns.&mdash;In a word, let it be the ge|nuine Go&s;pel of peace lifting above the world, warming the heart with the love of God and his creatures, and &s;u&s;taining the fortitude of good men by the a&s;&s;ured hope of a future
<PB N="41" REF="018739_0041_0FA81C82A2AB4268">
deliverance from death, and an infinite re|ward in the <HI>everla&s;ting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour.</HI></P>
<P>From the preceding ob&s;ervations it may be con|cluded, that it is impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould not admire the following article in the declaration of rights which forms the foundation of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;ett</HI>'s <Q>con&s;titution.&mdash;In this State every de|nomination of Chri&s;tians demeaning them|&s;elves peaceably and as good &s;ubjects of the commonwealth, &s;hall be EQUALLY under the protection of the law; and no &s;ubordination of any one &s;ect or denomination to another &s;hall ever be e&s;tabli&s;hed by law<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The NORTH CAROLINA con&s;titution al&s;o orders that there &s;hall be no e&s;tabli&s;hment of any one religious church or denomination in that place in preference to any other.</NOTE>.</Q></P>

<P>It appears farther from the preceding ob|&s;ervations, that I cannot but di&s;like the reli|gious te&s;ts which make a part of &s;everal of the <HI>American</HI> con&s;titutions.&mdash;In the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's</HI> con&s;titution it is ordered, that all who take &s;eats in the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives or Se|nate &s;hall declare <Q>their firm per&s;ua&s;ion of the

truth of the Chri&s;tian religion.</Q> The &s;ame is required by the <HI>Maryland</HI> con&s;titution, as a condition of being admitted into <HI>any</HI> places of profit or tru&s;t.

The dishone&s;t never &s;cruple them.</P>
<P>MONTESQUIEU probably was not a Chri&s;tian.

<HEAD>Of <HI>EDUCATION.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SUCH is the &s;tate of things which I wi&s;h to take place in the united <HI>American</HI> States. &mdash;In order to introduce and perpetuate it, and at the &s;ame time to give it the greate&s;t effect on the improvement of the world, nothing is more nece&s;&s;ary than the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a wi&s;e and liberal plan of EDUCATION. It is impo&s;|&s;ible properly to repre&s;ent the importance of this. So much is left by the author of nature to depend on the turn given to the mind in ear|ly life and the impre&s;&s;ions then made, that I have often thought there may be a <HI>&s;ecret</HI> re|maining to be di&s;covered in education, which will cau&s;e future generations to grow up vir|tuous and happy, and accelerate human im|provement to a greater degree than can at pre&s;ent be imagined.</P>
<P>The end of education is to direct the powers of the mind in unfolding them&s;elves; and to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in gaining their ju&s;t bent and force. And, in order to this, its bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould be to teach <HI>how</HI> to think, rather than <HI>what</HI> to think; or to lead into the be&s;t way of &s;earch|ing for truth, rather than to in&s;truct in truth it&s;elf.&mdash;As for the latter who is qualified for it? There are many indeed who are eager to undertake this office. All parties and &s;ects think they have di&s;covered truth, and that they alone are its advocates and friends. But the
<PB N="44" REF="018739_0044_0FA81C84E3A49E58">
very different and incon&s;i&s;tent accounts they give of it demon&s;trate they are utter &s;trangers to it; and that it is better to teach <HI>nothing,</HI> than to teach what they hold out for truth. The greater their confidence, the greater is the rea&s;on for di&s;tru&s;ting them. We gene|rally &s;ee the warme&s;t zeal, where the object of it is the greate&s;t non&s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Such ob&s;ervations have a particular ten|dency to &s;hew that education ought to be an initiation into candour, rather than into any &s;y&s;tems of faith; and it &s;hould form a habit of cool and patient inve&s;tigation, rather than an attachment to any opinions.</P>
<P>But hitherto education has been conducted on a contrary plan. It has been a <HI>contraction,</HI> not an <HI>enlargement</HI> of the intellectual faculties; an <HI>injection</HI> of fal&s;e principles hardening them in error, not a <HI>di&s;cipline</HI> enlightening and im|proving them. In&s;tead of opening and &s;trengthening them, and teaching to think <HI>freely;</HI> it hath cramped and en&s;laved them, and qualified for thinking only in <HI>one</HI> track. In&s;tead of in&s;tilling humility, charity, and li|berality, and thus preparing for an ea&s;ier di&s;|covery and a readier admi&s;&s;ion of truth; it has inflated with conceit, and &s;tuffed the human mind with wretched prejudices.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="018739_0045_0FA81C858D4D6540">The more has been learnt from <HI>&s;uch</HI> edu|cation, the more it becomes nece&s;&s;ary to un|learn. The more has been taught in this way, of &s;o much the more mu&s;t the mind be emptied before true wi&s;dom can enter.&mdash;Such was education in the time of the fir&s;t teach|ers of chri&s;tianity. By furni&s;hing with &s;kill in the arts of di&s;putation and &s;ophi&s;try, and producing an attachment to e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;y&s;|tems, it turned the minds of men from truth, and rendered them more determined to re&s;i&s;t evidence, and more capable of evading it. Hence it happened, that this heavenly in&s;truc|tion, when fir&s;t communicated, was <HI>to the Jews a &s;tumbling block, and to the Greeks fooli&s;h|ne&s;s;</HI> and that, in &s;pite of <HI>miracles them&s;elves,</HI> the per&s;ons who rejected it with mo&s;t di&s;dain, and who oppo&s;ed it with mo&s;t violence, were tho&s;e who had been educated in colleges, and were be&s;t ver&s;ed in the fal&s;e learning of the times: And had it taught the true philo&s;ophy in&s;tead of the true religion, the effect would have been the &s;ame. The doctrine <Q>that the &s;un &s;tood &s;till and that the earth moved round it,</Q> would have been reckoned no le&s;s ab&s;urd and incredible, than the doctrine of a <HI>crucified Me&s;&s;iah.</HI> And the men who would have treated &s;uch an in&s;truction with mo&s;t contempt, would have been the <HI>wi&s;e and the prudent;</HI> that is, the proud &s;ophi&s;ts and learn|ed doctors of the times, who had &s;tudied the <HI>Ptolemaick</HI> &s;y&s;tem of the world, and learnt, by
<PB N="46" REF="018739_0046_0FA81C86C2187020">
cycles and epicycles, to account for all the motions of the heavenly bodies.</P>
<P>In like manner, when the improvement of Logick in Mr. LOCKE'S <HI>E&s;&s;ay on the Human Under&s;tanding</HI> was fir&s;t publi&s;hed in <HI>Britain,</HI> the per&s;ons readie&s;t to attend to it and to re|ceive it were tho&s;e who had never been trained in colleges; and who&s;e minds, there|fore, had never been perverted by an in&s;truc|tion in the jargon of the &s;chools. To the deep profe&s;&s;ors of the time, it appeared (like the doctrine taught in his book on the rea|&s;onablene&s;s of chri&s;tianity) to be a danger|ous novelty and here&s;y; and the Univer&s;ity of OXFORD, in particular, condemned and re|probated the author.&mdash;The like happened when Sir ISAAC NEWTON'S di&s;coveries were fir&s;t publi&s;hed. A romance (that is, the Philo&s;ophy of DESCARTES) was then in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the philo&s;ophical world. Educa|tion had rivetted it in the minds of the learn|ed; and it was twenty-&s;even years before NEWTON'S <HI>Principia</HI> could gain &s;ufficient cre|dit to bring it to a &s;econd edition.&mdash;Such are the prejudices which have generally pre|vailed again&s;t new lights. Such the impedi|ments which have been thrown in the way of improvement by a narrow plan of education. &mdash;Even now the principal object of education (e&s;pecially in divinity) is to teach e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;y&s;tems as certain truths, and to qualify for &s;uc|ce&s;sfully

defending them again&s;t opponents; and thus to arm the mind again&s;t convictiOn, and render it impenetrable to farther light.

a habit of believing only on an overbalance of evidence; and of proportioning a&s;&s;ent in eve|ry ca&s;e to the degree of that overbalance, without regarding authority, antiquity, &s;in|gularity, novelty, or any of the prejudices which too commonly influence a&s;&s;ent.&mdash; Nothing is &s;o well fitted to produce this ha|bit as the &s;tudy of <HI>Mathematics.</HI> In the&s;e &s;ciences no one ever thinks of giving his a&s;|&s;ent to a propo&s;ition till he can clearly under|&s;tand it, and &s;ee it proved by a fair deduction from propo&s;itions previou&s;ly under&s;tood and proved.

<P>The United States have, I think, particular rea&s;on to dread the following effects of foreign trade.</P>

A pub|lic Bank, (while it can circulate its bills) faciliates commerce, and a&s;&s;i&s;ts the exertions of a State in proportion to its credit. But when it is not carefully re&s;tricted and watched; when its emi&s;&s;ions exceed the coin it can command, and are carried near the utmo&s;t length that the confidence of the public will allow; and when, in con&s;equence of this, its permanence comes to depend on the perma|nence of public credulity&mdash;In the&s;e circum|&s;tances, a BANK, though it may for a time (that is, while a balance of trade too unfavour|able does not occa&s;ion a run, and no events ari&s;e which produce alarms) an&s;wer all the

<P>The United States have already verified &s;ome of the&s;e ob&s;ervations, and felt in &s;ome degree the con&s;equences to which I have allu|ded.

In the fir&s;t edition of this tract I had mentioned improperly his <HI>want of addre&s;s</HI> among the other cau&s;es of his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from power.

I judge &s;o from the infatuation of the Briti&s;h in the pro&s;pect of conquering America, which continued until the adventure of Burgoyne made them in &s;ome degree open their eyes.

Although you have had re|gard to this truth, and have explained your|&s;elf thereon, yet perhaps it merits your care to develope it more at large, con&s;idering the little attention which hath been paid to it by even the mo&s;t zealous partizans of li|berty.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o a &s;trange thing that it &s;hould not be counted, in England, a trifling ob&s;ervati|on to &s;ay, that one nation can never have right to govern another; and that &s;uch a government could have no foundation but that of force, upon which al&s;o are &s;upported robbery and tyranny; that the tyranny of a people is of all known in the world the mo&s;t cruel and mo&s;t intolerable, leaving no remedy for the oppre&s;&s;ed; whereas a &s;in|gle de&s;pot is at length &s;topped in his career by &s;elf-intere&s;t, he has the check of remor&s;e, or that of public opinion; but a multitude makes no calculations, feels no remor&s;e, and

decrees to it&s;elf glory when in fact it de&s;erves the utmo&s;t di&s;grace.</P>
<P>Events are to the Engli&s;h nation a terrible commentary upon your book. For &s;ome months they have been falling headlong with accelerated rapidity. The knot is untied in regard to America. Lo &s;he is independent irrecoverably! Will &s;he be free and happy?

<P>I am not &s;atisfied, I own, with any con|&s;titutions which have as yet been framed by the different American States. You blame with rea&s;on that of Penn&s;ylvania for exacting a religious te&s;t upon admi&s;&s;ion into the re|pre&s;entative body. It is much wor&s;e in others.

an unrea&s;onable imitation of the u&s;ages of England. In&s;tead of bringing all the autho|rities into one, that of the nation, they have e&s;tabli&s;hed different bodies, a Hou&s;e of Re|pre&s;entatives, a Council, a Governor, becau&s;e England has an Hou&s;e of Commons an Hou&s;e of Lords and a King. They undertake to balance the&s;e different authorities as if the &s;ame equilibrium of powers which has been thought nece&s;&s;ary to balance the enormous preponde|rance of royalty could be of any u&s;e in repub|lics, formed upon the equality of all the citi|zens; and as if every article which con&s;titutes different bodies was not a &s;ource of divi&s;ions. By &s;triving to prevent imaginary dangers they have created real ones. They wi&s;h to have nothing to fear from the clergy, and yet unite them under the barrier of a common pro&s;crip|tion. By rendering them ineligible they be|come formed into a body and &s;uch an one as is foreign to the State. Why &s;hould one citizen who has the &s;ame intere&s;t as others in the common defence of liberty and property be excluded from contributing towards it his genius and virtues, becau&s;e he is of a profe&s;&s;ion in which genius and virtue are e&s;&s;entials? The clergy are only dangerous when they compo&s;e a body in the State; when they con|ceive them&s;elves to have rights and intere&s;ts as a body; or when it has been devi&s;ed to have a religion e&s;tabli&s;hed by law; as if men could have any right, or any intere&s;t in regulating each other's con&s;ciences; as if an individual
<PB N="77" REF="018739_0077_0FA81CA0A9458570">
could &s;acrifice to civil &s;ociety tho&s;e opinions on which he thinks his eternal &s;alvation de|pends, or as if mankind were to be &s;aved or to be damned by the lump. Wherever true toleration, that is to &s;ay, the ab&s;olute incom|petency of government over the con&s;cience of individuals is e&s;tabli&s;hed, there an eccle&s;i|a&s;tic when he is admitted into the national a&s;&s;embly is but a citizen, when he is excluded from it he becomes again an eccle&s;ia&s;tic.</P>
<P>I do not perceive that there has been &s;uffi|cient cau&s;e to reduce to the lowe&s;t po&s;&s;ible number the kinds of bu&s;ine&s;s which the go|vernment of each State is to manage; or to &s;eperate the objects of legi&s;lation from tho&s;e of the general and from tho&s;e of the particu|lar and local admini&s;tration; to con&s;titute &s;tan|ding local a&s;&s;emblies, which, by performing all the functions of detail in government, may free the general a&s;&s;emblies from engaging therein, and &s;o take from the members of the&s;e latter all means and perhaps all de&s;ire, to abu&s;e an authority which &s;hould only be occupied about objects general in their nature, and therefore unconnected with the little pa&s;&s;ions which agitate mankind.</P>
<P>Nor do I perceive that due attention has been paid to the great di&s;tinction, and the only one founded in nature between two cla&s;|&s;es of men; I mean tho&s;e who are proprie|tors in lands and tho&s;e who are not;&mdash;to their

intere&s;ts and con&s;equently to their different rights, with re&s;pect to legi&s;lation, to the ad|mini&s;tration of ju&s;tice and of the police, to the contribution for public expences and to their employments.</P>
<P>No fixed principle is e&s;tabli&s;hed in regard to impo&s;ts. Each State is &s;uppo&s;ed to be at liberty to tax it&s;elf at plea&s;ure, and to lay its taxes upon per&s;ons, con&s;umptions, or impor|tations, that is to &s;ay, to erect an intere&s;t con|trary to that of the other States.</P>
<P>They &s;uppo&s;e in all the States that they have a right to regulate commerce. They even authorize the executive bodies or the governors to prohibit the exportation of cer|tain products upon particular occa&s;ions; &s;o far are they from &s;eeing that the law of intire liberty of all commerce is a corollary of the right of property; &s;o far are they &s;till invol|ved in the mi&s;ts of European illu&s;ions.</P>
<P>In the general union of the States with one another, I do not &s;ee a coalition, a melting of all the parts together, &s;o as to make the body <HI>one</HI> and homogenious. It is only an aggre|gate of parts, always too &s;eperate, and which have a continual tendency to divide them|&s;elves, from the diver&s;ity of their laws, their manners, and their opinions; from the ine|quality of their pre&s;ent &s;trength, but more &s;till from the inequality of their future progre&s;s.

This whole edifice has been &s;up|ported until now upon the fal&s;e ba&s;is of very ancient and very vulgar policy; upon the prejudice which nations, which provinces may have concerning intere&s;ts as a province or a nation, different from tho&s;e which indi|viduals have of being free and defending their properties again&s;t robbers and conquerors: &mdash;a pretended intere&s;t in carrying on more commerce than others, in not buying mer|chandize of foreigners, but in forcing the&s;e to con&s;ume our productions and the works of our manufacturers:&mdash;a pretended intere&s;t in having more exten&s;ive territory, in ac|quiring &s;uch and &s;uch a province, &s;uch and &s;uch an i&s;land, &s;uch and &s;uch a town&mdash;an inter|e&s;t in in&s;piring other nations with dread:&mdash;an intere&s;t in excelling them in the glory of arms or that of arts and &s;ciences.</P>
<P>Each of the&s;e prejudices is cheri&s;hed in Europe, becau&s;e the ancient rivalry of na|tions and the ambition of princes obliges all States to be in arms for defence again&s;t their armed neighbours, and to regard a military force as the principal object of government. Such is the good fortune of America that &s;he cannot have for a long time an external enemy to fear, if &s;he does not become &s;elf-divided; therefore &s;he may and ought to e&s;timate, at their true value, tho&s;e pretended intere&s;ts, tho&s;e

grounds of di&s;cord which are all that can en|danger her liberty. The &s;acred principle of freedom of commerce being con&s;idered as the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of the right of pro|perty, all the pretended intere&s;ts of trade vani&s;h before it. The pretended intere&s;t of po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ing more or le&s;s territory vani&s;hes al&s;o when the territory is ju&s;tly con&s;idered as not belong|ing to nations but to the individual proprie|tors of the &s;oil; and when the que&s;tion whe|ther &s;uch a canton or &s;uch a village ought to belong to &s;uch a province or &s;uch a &s;tate is not decided by the pretended intere&s;t of that province or that &s;tate, but by the intere&s;t which the inhabitants of the canton or village have in a&s;&s;embling them&s;elves to tran&s;act their af|fairs in places the mo&s;t convenient of acce&s;s; when that intere&s;t, being mea&s;ured by the length or &s;hortne&s;s of the way which a man can go to manage his mo&s;t important without too much injury to his common concerns, becomes the natural and phy&s;ical mea&s;ure of the extent of the juri&s;diction of States, and e&s;tabli&s;hes, throughout, an equilibrium<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This &s;eems to be a particular of much con&s;equence.

<P><PB N="81" REF="018739_0081_0FA81CA3DBE69BD0">The intere&s;t of being dreaded becomes null when we make no <HI>demands,</HI> and when we are in a &s;ituation not to be attacked even by a con&s;iderable force with any hope of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The glory of arms cannot compare with the felicity of living in peace. The glory of arts and &s;ciences belongs to every one who has &s;pirit to acquire it. There is an harve&s;t of this kind abundantly &s;ufficient for every body; the field of di&s;coveries cannot be over|tilled, and ALL profit by the di&s;coveries of ALL.</P>
<P>I imagine that the Americans have not felt the&s;e truths &s;o &s;trongly as they ought to be felt by them for the &s;ecurity of the happi|ne&s;s of their po&s;terity. I blame not their lea|ders. There was a nece&s;&s;ity of providing again&s;t the exigencies of the moment by &s;ome &s;ort of union, again&s;t an enemy actually pre&s;ent and formidable; there was not time to correct the defects in con&s;titutions or in the models of the different States. But there &s;hould be a dread of perpetuating them, and an application to the means of uniting opini|ons and intere&s;ts, and of reducing them to uniform principles throughout all the States.</P>
<P>In this pur&s;uit there are great ob&s;tacles to be overcome.</P>

<P>In New-England&mdash;a &s;pirit of rigid puritani&s;m &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, and always, as is &s;aid, in &s;ome degree intolerant.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This has been ONCE true of the inhabitants of NEW-ENGLAND, but it is not &s;o NOW. See p. 41.</NOTE></P>
<P>In Penn&s;ylvania&mdash;a great number of citi|zens who &s;upporting a religious principle that the profe&s;&s;ion of arms is illicit, of cour&s;e re|volt from &s;uch arrangements as are nece&s;&s;ary to lay the foundation of a military &s;trength for the State, in an union of the quality of citizen with that of &s;oldier and militia-man; which brings on a nece&s;&s;ity of making the bu&s;ine&s;s of war a bu&s;ine&s;s for mercenaries.</P>
<P>In the middle States&mdash;a too great inequality of fortunes and more e&s;pecially the great num|ber of black &s;laves who&s;e &s;lavery is incompa|tible with a good political con&s;titution, and who, even if &s;et at liberty, would &s;till give em|barra&s;&s;ment by forming two people in one State.</P>
<P>Throughout&mdash;prejudices, an attachment to e&s;tabli&s;hed forms, an habitude of certain tax|es, a dread of &s;uch as &s;hould be &s;ub&s;tituted in their place, the vanity of tho&s;e States who have thought them&s;elves the mo&s;t powerful, and an unhappy beginning of national pride.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="018739_0083_0FA81CA5385831C0">I think the Americans are bound to agran|di&s;e them&s;elves not by war but by cultivation. If they leave at their backs tho&s;e immen&s;e de&s;erts which extend even to the we&s;tern ocean, a mixture of the bani&s;hed and other vile &s;ub|jects e&s;caped from the correction of laws may there &s;ettle with the Savages, and compo&s;e &s;warms of robbers, who would ravage America as the Barbarians of the North have ravaged the Roman empire; hence another danger,&mdash;the nece&s;&s;ity of being in arms on the frontiers and living in a continual &s;tate of war. The &s;et|tlements near to the&s;e would con&s;equently be more warlike than the re&s;t: and that inequali|ty of military force would be a terrible &s;pur to ambition. The remedy for this inequality would be to maintain a &s;tanding force to which all the States &s;hould contribute ac|cording to their population; but, the Ame|ricans who have &s;till all the fears which the Engli&s;h ought to have, dread nothing more than a permanent army. They are in the wrong. Nothing is ea&s;ier than to connect the con&s;titution of a permanent army with the militia, &s;o that the militia may thence be|come better, and liberty thus be rendered more &s;ecure. But it is far from ea&s;y to calm their fears on this head.</P>
<P>Here you &s;ee are many difficulties; and, perhaps, the &s;ecret intere&s;ts of powerful indi|viduals will unite with the prejudices of the

vulgar to re&s;i&s;t the efforts of true &s;ages and true citizens.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to refrain from fervent wi&s;hes that this people may arrive at all the pro&s;pe|rity of which it is &s;u&s;ceptible. It is the hope of the human race. It may become their mo|del. It &s;hould prove to the world in fact that men may be free and tranquil, and may rid them&s;elves from the many &s;hackles which ty|rants and impo&s;tures of every garb have en|deavoured to impo&s;e on them, under a pre|text of the public good. It &s;hould give an example of political freedom, of religious freedom, of the freedom of commerce and of indu&s;try. The a&s;ylum which it opens to all the oppre&s;&s;ed of all nations, ought to con&s;ole the whole earth. The facility of taking ad|vantage of this to get free from the effects of bad governments will oblige &s;uch governments to grow ju&s;t and enlightned; and the re&s;t of the world will by degrees open their eyes up|on that bubble of illu&s;ions wherein politicians have lulled them&s;elves. But, for this Ame|rica ought to become guarantee, and that &s;he will never come to be what your mini&s;terial writers have &s;o often repeated, an image of our Europe, an amas of divided powers, quar|relling about territories or the profits of com|merce, and continually cementing the &s;lavery of the people with their own blood.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="018739_0085_0FA81CA69039A7F0">All men of under&s;tanding, all the friends humanity &s;hould at this time unite their knowledge and join their reflections to tho&s;e of the &s;age Americans to contribute the great work of their legi&s;lation. This, Sir, would be worthy of you. I wi&s;h I may kindle up your zeal: And, if in this letter I have allow|ed my&s;elf to be hurried on by my own ideas further than was proper, that wi&s;h hath been my only motive, and will, as I hope, excu&s;e me where I may have been tedious to you. I am de&s;irous that the blood which hath flow|ed, or which may it &s;till flow in this quarrel, &s;hould not be u&s;ele&s;s towards the happine&s;s of mankind.</P>
<P>Our two nations are about to do each other much injury, though neither of them will from thence reap any real profit. The en|crea&s;e of debts and expences * * * * * * * * * * * * *, and the ruin of a great num|ber of citizens will perhaps be the only re&s;ult. England appears to me to be nearer to it than France. If, in&s;tead of this war, you had been able to behave with a good grace from the very beginning; if policy had been allowed to do before hand what &s;he will infallibly be forced to do in the end; if the national opi|nion could have been brought to allow your government to prevent what has happened, &s;uppo&s;ing it to have been fore&s;een, if it

could have con&s;ented out-right to the inde|pendence of America, without making war upon any one, I firmly believe that Britain would have lo&s;t nothing by the change. Now &s;he will lo&s;e whatever &s;he has expended, or &s;hall yet expend: She will experience a great diminution for &s;ome time in her commerce, and great internal confu&s;ion, if &s;he is forced into a bankruptcy; and, be that as it may, a great lo&s;s of political influence abroad.</P>
<P>But this la&s;t article is of very &s;mall import to the real happine&s;s of a people; and I am not at all of Abbe Rainal's opinion in your motto. I do not think that this will bring you to be a contemptible people and throw you into bondage.</P>
<P>Your misfortunes will perhaps on the con|trary, produce the effect of a nece&s;&s;ary ampu|tation. They may be the only means of &s;aving you from the gangreene of luxury and corruption. If in your agitations you could correct your con&s;titution by making elections annual, by di&s;tributing the right of repre&s;en|tation more equally and in better proportion to the intere&s;ts of tho&s;e repre&s;ented, you would gain perhaps as much as America by this revolution; becau&s;e your liberty would remain to you, and your other lo&s;&s;es would &s;oon be repaired with that, and by that.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="018739_0087_0FA81CA84C38A980">You &s;hould judge, Sir, from the frankne&s;s with which I open my&s;elf to you upon the&s;e deli|cate points, of the e&s;teem with which you have in&s;pired me, and of the &s;atisfaction which I feel upon ob&s;erving that there is &s;ome re|&s;emblance in our modes of thinking.
