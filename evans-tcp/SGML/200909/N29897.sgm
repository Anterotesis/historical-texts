<HEAD>An ANSWER TO A BOOK, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Having taken &s;ome Remarks upon &s;aid Book as followeth. In his Preface he &s;eems to limit the Wor&s;hip due to God, more at &s;ome certain times than at other times; and to carry a long, as if Prayer was one of the greate&s;t Part of Wor&s;hip to God, quoting <HI>Mat.</HI> 6.6. which Scripture con|tains the whole Doctrine of Prayer, which Chri&s;t taught in a general way to his Di&s;ciples, as appears in the be|ginning of his Sermon to them, Mat. 5.1.2. <HI>His Di&s;ci+ples came unto him, and he opened his Mouth and taught them.</HI> Compare this with the Conclu&s;ion of his Sermon Mat. 7.14. <HI>Therefore who&s;oever heareth the&s;e Sayings of mine and doth them, I will liken him unto a wi&s;e Man,</HI> &amp;c. So that this contains a general Doctrine to all his Di&s;ci|ples relating to Prayer, not to be as the Hypocrites are, as in the 5th Ver&s;e, <HI>for they love to pray &s;tanding in the Synagogues,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Verily I &s;ay unto You, they have their Re|ward,</HI> that is, the Prai&s;e of Men. Thus Chri&s;t &s;ingles out his Di&s;ciples from the Multitudes of Hypocrites, (as appears <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.1.2.) as God did his People I&s;rael. Exod. 20.2, 3. <HI>I am the Lord thy God,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>thou &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="2" REF="039751_0003_1015C0BFEDC50A80">
have no other gods,</HI> &amp;c. Thus, as God &s;ingles out I&s;rael as being his peculiar People, &s;o doth Chri&s;t his Di&s;ciples, Mat. 6.6. <HI>But thou when thou praye&s;t,</HI> &amp;c. &s;peaking to his peculiar Di&s;ciples, in the &s;ingular Number, &s;ingling them out from Hypocrites, as God did I&s;rael from other Nations, &s;aying, <HI>Thou &s;halt have no other god,</HI> &amp;c. Even &s;o &s;aith Chri&s;t unto his Di&s;ciples, <HI>When thou praye&s;t thou &s;halt not be as the Hypocrites.</HI></P>
<P>When God's Children were in a Holy Frame, and a|greed to Fa&s;t and Pray, they did it not with a mixt Mul|titude, in publick A&s;&s;emblies, as Hypocrites are wont to do; as appears, Neh. 9.1, 2. <HI>The Children of I&s;rael &s;eparated them&s;elves from all Strangers,</HI> in time of offer|ing up their Prayers unto God. Acts 1.13.14. <HI>And when they were come in, they went up into an upper Room,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>The&s;e all continued with one accord in Prayer,</HI> &amp;c. And we no where read, throughout the whole Bible, that God's Children ever prayed in a publick A&s;&s;embly with a mixt Multitude, in a cu&s;tomary way, as Hypocritical I&s;rael was wont to do; as throughout the whole Scrip|ture doth appear, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.26.</P>
<P>And <HI>Secondly,</HI> The Scripture makes a Di&s;tinction be|tween Fa&s;ting and Prayer, and Wor&s;hip to God, as ap|pears, Joh. 9.31. <HI>Now we know that God heareth not Sinners,</HI> (that is, their Prayers) <HI>but if any Man be a Wor&s;hiper of God, and doth his will, him he heareth.</HI> Here the Scripture makes a Di&s;tinction betwen the Wor&s;hip of God and Prayer, &s;hewing that he that wor&s;hipeth God and doth his Will, &s;uch an one God heareth his Prayers, Zech. 7.5. <HI>When ye fa&s;ted and mourned</HI> &amp;c. <HI>did ye at all fa&s;t unto me? And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink; did ye not eat, and did ye not drink for your &s;elves?</HI> But the true Wor&s;hip of God is expre&s;s'd in the 9th and 10th Ver&s;es. <HI>Mic.</HI> 6. 6th and 7th Ver&s;es &s;peaks of Pray|er, but the 8th Ver&s;e &s;peaks of Wor&s;hip to God.</P>
<P>And,</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Wor&s;hip of God is not limited to any particular Place, as appeareth, <HI>Joh.</HI> 4, 21, 22. compared with the 23d Ver&s;e. <HI>The hour cometh, when ye &s;hall nei|ther in this Mountain, nor yet at Jeru&s;alem wor&s;hip the
<PB N="3" REF="039751_0004_1015C0C1787A5FC0">
Father: Ye wor&s;hip ye know not what,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>But the hour cometh and now is, when the true Wor&s;hipers, &s;hall wor|&s;hip the Father in Spirit and in Truth,</HI> &amp;c. Rom. 14.17, 18. <HI>For the Kingdom of God is Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Peace, and Joy in the Holy Gho&s;t: For he that in the&s;e things &s;erveth Christ, is acceptable to God,</HI> &amp;c. For the Service, or Wor&s;hip we owe to God, is <HI>to pre&s;ent our Bodies a li|ving Sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which it the rea|&s;onable Service we owe to him,</HI> Rom. 12.1. No Man can &s;erve God while he is in the Spiritual Egypt, or under the Power of Sin, nor till the Son of God &s;ets him free from that Bondage, as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> did I&s;rael, before they could &s;erve God, as appears, Joh. 8. comparing the 34th Ver&s;e with the 36. <HI>Who&s;oever committeth Sin is the Ser|vant of Sin: If the Son therefore &s;hall make you free, ye &s;hall be free indeed.</HI></P>
<P>And all Prayer that proceeds from an unclean Heart, is an abomination to the Lord, <HI>Prov.</HI> 15.8. <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 1.11. compared with the 16th, 17th, and 18th Ver&s;es. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 66.18. And all Prayer that is offered to God, and not in Faith, is but a Delu&s;ion: <HI>For without Faith it is impo&s;&s;i|ble to plea&s;e God,</HI> Heb. 11.6. For every Prayer that is offer'd up to God, &amp; not in Faith&punc; is but a vain Babbling, &amp; will avail nothing, as appears <HI>Jam.</HI> 1. comparing the 6th Ver&s;e with the 7th. <HI>But let him ask in Faith,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>For let not that Man think that he &s;hall receive any thing of the Lord,</HI> i. e. if his Prayer be not in Faith; and this Faith cannot be but to a pure Con&s;cience, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.9. <HI>Chap.</HI> 1.19.</P>
<P>This have I written that People may not be mi&s;led, by thinking they wor&s;hip God in Forms, and &s;et Times of Prayer, while they are in a State of Sin; and that they may con&s;ider, the Publican, upon his fir&s;t Prayer, accompanied with true Repentance, went away rather ju&s;tifyed than the other, that was zealous in his often Fa&s;ting and Prayers, <HI>Luk.</HI> 18.10, &amp;c.</P>
<P>And in the next Place I &s;hall enter upon his Scripture Proof about his Fir&s;t Day Sabbath, &s;eeing the Scripture <HI>is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Instruction, that the Man of God may be perfect,</HI> &amp;c. 2 Tim. 3.16, 17. <HI>For if they &s;peak not according to this Word, it
<PB N="4" REF="039751_0005_1015C0C4D4DBE7A0">
is becau&s;e there is no Light in them,</HI> I&s;ai. 8.20. <HI>For where no Law is, there is no Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion,</HI> Rom. 4.15. And therefore I &s;hall examine his Scripture Proof, and &s;ee what Law he produceth out of the holy Scriptures for his Fir&s;t Day Sabbath.</P>
<P>In <HI>Page</HI> 5th &s;aith he, <HI>The Apo&s;tle doth not oppo&s;e the keeping one Day in a Week holy to God.</HI> To which I an|&s;wer, It is not what the Apo&s;tle doth not oppo&s;e, but what the Apo&s;tle commands, 1 Pet. 1.16. <HI>Be ye holy for I am holy.</HI> An unholy Man cannot do one holy Act, no more than a corrupt Tree can bring forth good Fruit: But I have no where read in the Books of the New Te&s;tament, that we are commanded to keep one Day more holy than another.</P>
<P>And in the &s;ame <HI>Page</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>Christ came not to de&s;troy the Law,</HI> Mat. 5.17. This is very true, <HI>for what the Law could not do,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>God &s;ending his own Son,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>for Sin, or by a Sacrifice for Sin, condemned Sin in the Fle&s;h, that the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the Fle&s;h, but after the Spirit,</HI> Rom. 8.3.4. Thus Chri&s;t fulfills the Law in us, for there is no Law again&s;t the Fruit of the Spirit. And thus Chii&s;t came to fulfil the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Law in us, <HI>who walk not after the Fle&s;h, but after the Spirit, beau&s;e the Love of God is &s;hed abroad in our Hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us,</HI> Rom. 5.5. And by this Love we keep the Law perfectly, as appears, <HI>Rom.</HI> 13.8, 9, 10. <HI>Gal.</HI> 5.14. So that Chri&s;t did not come to de&s;troy the Law, but to fulfil the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of it in us, <HI>for Chri&s;t is the end of the Law for Righteou&s;ne&s;s, to every one that belie|veth,</HI> Rom. 10.4.</P>
<P>And in the &s;ame <HI>Page</HI> he quotes Mat. 24.20. <HI>Pray that your Flight be not in the Winter, nor on the Sabbath Day.</HI> This was &s;poken of a Time that was to come, which came to pa&s;s (as he &s;aith) about Forty Years after, which is very true. Now we are to con&s;ider, that the&s;e Jews had a Zeal for God, but not according to Knowledge, for we find by Record of Scripture, that in Chri&s;t's Time they were very zealous in the Ob&s;ervation of the Seventh Day Sabbath, having a very plain Commandment for it, and
<PB N="5" REF="039751_0006_1015C0C6A4BB3E78">
often judged our Saviour as being guilty of the Breach of it, in bidding the Man that was healed to carry his Bed on it, with &s;everal other Things which he did upon it, and therefore did the Jews per&s;ecute Je&s;us, and &s;ought to &s;lay him, becau&s;e he had done the&s;e Things on the Sabbath Day. Joh. 5.16. <HI>Therefore &s;aid Some of the Pha|ri&s;ees, This Man is not of God, becau&s;e he keepeth not the Sabbath Day,</HI> Joh. 9.16. But at this time they were un|der the Roman Government, who did not allow them to put any Man to Death, <HI>Joh.</HI> 18, 31. But Forty Years af|ter, they rebelled again&s;t the Romans, and then put in Execution their own Laws: And tho' it was no greater Sin to take their Flight on the Sabbath than in the Winter to &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">e Life (for it was a Deed of Mercy, and a Duty as much to be done on the Sabbath Day as on any other Day,) but more danger of Death by the Jews, than to take their Flight in the Winter; for po&s;&s;ibly they might e&s;cape in the Winter, but if taken by the Jews in their Flight on the Sabbath Day, there was then nothing to be expect|ed by them but Death, without Mercy: Therefore our Lord exhorted his Di&s;ciples to pray to him that was able to cau&s;e them to e&s;cape tho&s;e two Dangers, upon their Flight which he exhorted them to take, <HI>Luk.</HI> 21.20, 21. <HI>Mat.</HI> 24.16.</P>
<P>And in the &s;ame <HI>Page</HI> he quotes <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 66.22, 23. and &s;aith, <HI>New Te&s;tament Wor&s;hip is here foretold in Old Te&s;ta|ment Phra&s;e,</HI> which I will not deny: But I &s;ay, <HI>from one New Moon to another mea&s;ures the whole Month,</HI> and <HI>from one Sabbath to another mea&s;ures the whole Week,</HI> and limits no time one more than another, and carries in it a con|tinual Wor&s;hip to God: for they that wor&s;hip him in the&s;e Go&s;pel Times, mu&s;t not think to wor&s;hip him in New Moons and Sabbaths, as it was under the Law, which were only Shadows and Signs, but <HI>the body is of Chri&s;t,</HI> Ezek. 20.12, 20. Col. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">. 16, 17. For they that wor&s;hip him now in Go&s;pel Times, <HI>mu&s;t wor&s;hip him in Spirit and in Truth,</HI> in their inward Man, without Regard to Time or Place, having a circumci&s;ed Heart, <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.3.</P>
<P>In <HI>Page</HI> 6. he quotes <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.2, 3. which &s;peaks only of God's re&s;ting from the Works of Creation, when all
<PB N="6" REF="039751_0007_1015C0C867B07620">
things were fini&s;hed, and was very good, as they came from the Hand of God: and this God's Sabbath, or Re&s;t from his Works of Creation, had no Evening or Morning a&s;cribed to it, becau&s;e it was his Eternal Re&s;t or Sabbath, all things being now fini&s;hed: And it could be no <HI>Rest</HI> or <HI>Sabbath</HI> to <HI>Adam,</HI> for he had done no Work to <HI>re&s;t from,</HI> for he was the fini&s;hing Work, or la&s;t thing God created: So that God's fini&s;hing Work, and <HI>Adam</HI>'s fir&s;t becoming a living Creature, began at one and the &s;ame time: So that <HI>Adam</HI> in his fir&s;t Creation, entred into God's Sab|bath, and &s;o continued, till he by Sin brought Labour up|on him&s;elf. The <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> quotes this very Place, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2. 2. as is to be &s;een <HI>Hob.</HI> 4.4. which &s;peaks only of God's own <HI>Rest</HI> from the Works of Creation, and we have&punc; to Account in Scripture of any Sabbath commanded or kept from <HI>Adam</HI> till <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> time; for God did not make that Covenant of the Ten Commandments till <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> time, as appears <HI>Deut.</HI> 4.13. compared with <HI>Deut.</HI> 5.2, 3. and compared with the 15th Ver&s;e, which gives the Rea&s;on of the 4th Commandment, why I&s;rael was commanded to keep the Sabbath: For when God delivered the two Ta|bles of the Ten Commandments, he gave <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> a particu|lar Account about the Seventh Day Sabbath, how it was a Sign, as is to be &s;een, <HI>Exod.</HI> 31.12, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> compared with the la&s;t Ver&s;e. In the 13th Ver&s;e &s;aith the Lord, <HI>Verily my Sabbaths ye &s;hall keep, for it is a Sign between me and you.</HI> Ver&s;e 17. <HI>It is a Sign between me and the Children of I&s;rael.</HI> And a <HI>Sign</HI> is not the thing &s;ignified by it, no more than the <HI>Shadow</HI> of a thing is the <HI>Sub&s;tance.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Page</HI> 7. is quoted <HI>Mark.</HI> 2.28. <HI>The Son of Man is Lord al|&s;o of the Sabbath:</HI> But he adds to what is there written for Chri&s;t did not there &s;peak as he was the Son of God, but Son of Man; for the Rea&s;on that Chri&s;t there renders to them how the Son of Man came to be Lord of the Sabbath, is, becau&s;e <HI>the Sabbath was made for Man, and not Man for the Sabbath; therefore</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>the Son of Man is Lord al&s;o of the Sabbath,</HI> for it was commanded to be kept for a <HI>Sign</HI> between God and I&s;rael, &s;o that it was made for Man to be a Sign to him, and therefore (&s;aith he) <HI>the Son of Man is Lord al&s;o of the Sabbath.</HI> He doth not
<PB N="7" REF="039751_0008_1015C0C9F5577CB0">
&s;peak here, as if he had any Power as he was the Son of Man to change it, for he <HI>as Son of Man,</HI> was <HI>made of a Woman, made under the Law,</HI> as much as any other Son of Man, <HI>Gal.</HI> 4.4. But what he &s;aid, was to convict them of their Blindne&s;s, in preferring the Sanctification of the Sabbath before the &s;atisfying the hungry Soul, whenas the Sabbath was made only for a Sign to Man. So that Chri&s;t's Argument was good, to prove that every Son of Man that it was made for, was Lord of it, it being made for him, to be a Sign to him: for the Lord of any thing is to be preferred before the thing made for him. The Man was not made for the Woman, but the Woman for the Man, there|fore the Man is Lord of the Woman, &s;o called in Scripture, <HI>Gen.</HI> 18.12. <HI>Judg.</HI> 19.26. But this is no Argument there|fore, that a Man may change his Wife, becau&s;e he is her Lord.</P>
<P>In <HI>Page</HI> 8. he quotes <HI>Heb.</HI> 4.10. which &s;peaks of the Antitype of the Weekly Seventh Day Sabbath, which it was a Sign of, as appears in the foregoing and following Ver&s;es, <HI>There remaineth therefore a Re&s;t, or keeping a Sab|bath to the People of God; for he that is entered into his Re&s;t</HI> (which is <HI>Christ) hath cea&s;ed from his own works, as God did from his. Let us labour therefore</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>to enter into that Re&s;t.</HI> This is the everla&s;ting Sabbath that <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is entered into, and we are exhorted in this place, to labour to enter into it, which the Seventh Day was a Sign of; and this place relates nothing to any <HI>Fir&s;t Day Sabbath,</HI> but to that <HI>Re&s;t</HI> or <HI>Sabbath</HI> &s;poken of <HI>Rev.</HI> 14.13.</P>
<P>In <HI>Page</HI> 11. &s;aith he, <HI>The Fir&s;t Day was prophecied of,</HI> &amp;c. P&s;al. 118.22, 23, 24. <HI>The Stone which the Builders refu&s;ed, is become the Head Stone of the corner. This is the Lord</HI>'s <HI>doings, and it is marvellous in our eyes. This is the Day which the Lord hath made, we will rejoyce and be glad in it.</HI> This was fulfilled in <HI>David,</HI> as he was a Type of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and fulfilled in <HI>Christ,</HI> as he was the Antitype of <HI>David;</HI> and relates nothing to any rejoycing in a natural or artificial Day, but in God, who had brought <HI>David</HI> out of the Day of his Troubles, who was the Stone that <HI>Saul</HI> and the Builders of I&s;rael had rejected, and &s;ought to de|&s;troy,
<PB N="8" REF="039751_0009_1015C0CF75329760">
but now God had brought him to the Kingdom, and made him the Head of I&s;rael: Even the Stone which the Builders refu&s;ed, was now become the Head Stone of the Corner, and was the Day that <HI>David</HI> and his Servants re|joyced in the Lord, even the Day that the Lord had made him the Head Stone of the Corner, but his Joy was not in any one natural or artificial Day, but in the Lord, who had made it the Day of his Pro&s;perity and Exaltation, the Day of his Adver&s;ity <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ing now over: It is a Scripture Phra&s;e, not intending any particular Day, but a Day or Time of Gladne&s;s. And was al&s;o fulfilled in <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> who was a Man of <HI>Sorrows,</HI> &amp; rejected &amp; put to Death, but God rai&s;ed him from the Dead, and hath exalted him, and given him a Name above every Name, &s;o that at the Name of Je&s;us every Knee &s;hould bow, &amp;c. And this is the everla&s;ting Day of rejoycing with the Saints in God that hath made it, and not in a natural Day, either to ob&s;erve the Day of his Birth, or the Day of his Re&s;urrection, when no &s;uch thing is commanded of God, for that is wor&s;hiping the Creature, and not the Creator.</P>
<P>In the next place I &s;hall &s;hew, that the Fir&s;t Command|ment, that both the Angel of God and <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> him&s;elf gave forth to his Apo&s;tles, was to make the <HI>Fir&s;t Day</HI> of the Week (the Day of his Re&s;urrection) a Day of Labour, by travelling out of one Province into another, as appears, <HI>Mat.</HI> 28.5. compared with the 10th and 7th Ver&s;es, <HI>And the Angel an&s;wered and &s;aid to the Women, go quickly and tell his Di&s;ciples, that he is ri&s;en from the Dead, and behold, he goeth before you into Gallilee, there &s;hall ye &s;ee him. Then &s;aid Je&s;us unto them, go tell my Brethren, that they go into Gallilee, there &s;hall ye &s;ee me.</HI> And in the 8th Ver&s;e it is &s;aid, <HI>And they departed quickly, and did run, to bring his Di&s;ciples Word.</HI> Compare this with Luke 24, 10, 11. <HI>It was Mary Magdalen,</HI> &amp;c. which told the&s;e things to the Apo&s;tles, <HI>and their Words &s;eemed to them as idle Tales, and they believed them not.</HI> Thus it appears, that had they believed them that was &s;ent by the Angel of God, and by <HI>Christ</HI> him&s;elf, they &s;hould have &s;et out on their Journey early in the Morning for <HI>Gallilee,</HI> which was in another Province, and by all Probability, more than
<PB N="9" REF="039751_0010_1015C0D11BE65968">
one Days Journey, as appears in the &s;econd Chapter of <HI>Luke,</HI> which &s;hews, that Chri&s;t's Parents went a Days Journey towards <HI>Gallilee</HI> before they mi&s;t him; and his <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> not believing, &amp; thereby not obeying his order, he did not appear to them all that Day, but travelled with Two of his Di&s;ci|ples that were going from <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> to <HI>Immaus,</HI> which is Sixty Furlongs, which contains Seven Engli&s;h Miles and Half, as appears, <HI>Luke</HI> 24.13. And it appears Ver&s;e 28, 29. that he made as tho' he would have gone further, but they con&s;trained him to abide with them, for it was towards Evening, and the Day was far &s;pent, &s;o he went in to tarry with them; but their Eyes were holden, that they knew him not, <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 16. But as they were eating he gave them Bread, <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 30. And their Eyes were opened.

And here follows an Account of &s;ome Part of what I pre|&s;ented
<PB N="19" REF="039751_0020_1015C0EBDCD7D1D0">
to them, taken out of the Confe&s;&s;ion of their own Faith.</P>
<P>In <HI>Page</HI> 6. Fir&s;t Coun&s;el, <HI>That you be immoveably and unchangeably agreed in the only &s;ufficient, and invari|able Rule of Religion, which is the Holy Scripture, the fix|ed Canon, uncapable of Addition and Diminution. You ought to account nothing ancient, that will not &s;tand by this Rule, nor any thing new that will. Do not hold your &s;elves bound to un&s;criptual Rites in Religion, wherein Cu&s;tom it &s;elf doth many times mi&s;guide&punc; I&s;ai.</HI> 8.20. To the Law and to the Te&s;timony, if they &s;peak not ac|cording to this Word, it is becau&s;e there is no Light in them.</P>
<P>Second Coun&s;el, <HI>That you be determined by this Rule in the whole of Religion. That your Faith be right and divine, the Word of God mu&s;t be the Foundation of it, and the Authority of the Word the Rea&s;on of it,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>For an orthodox Chri&s;tian to re&s;olve his Faith into Education, In|&s;truction, and the Per&s;wa&s;ion of others, is not an higher Rea&s;on than a Papi&s;t, Mahometan or Pagan, can produce for his Religion.</HI></P>
<P>Page 7. <HI>Believe, in all Divine Wor&s;hip, it is not enough that this or that Act of Wor&s;hip is not forbidden in the Word of God; if it be not commanded, and you perform it, you may fear you will be found guilty, and be expo&s;ed to divine Di&s;plea&s;ure.</HI> Nadab <HI>and</HI> Abihu <HI>paid dear for of|fering in divine Wor&s;hip, that which the Lord commanded them not. It is an honour done unto Chri&s;t, when you ac|cout that only decent, orderly and convenient in his Hou&s;e, which depends upon the In&s;titution and Appointment of him|&s;elf, who is the only Head and Lawgiver of his Church.</HI></P>
<P>Page 65. <HI>God alone is Lord of the Con&s;cience, and hath left it free from the Doctrines and Commandments of Men, which are in any thing contrary to his Word, or not con|tained in it: So that to believe &s;uch Doctrines, or to obey &s;uch Commands out of Con&s;cience, is to betray true Liberty of Con&s;cience; and the requiring of an implicit Faith, and an ab&s;olute and blind Obedience, is to destroy Liberty of Con&s;cience and Rea&s;on al&s;o. Acts</HI> 4.19. Whether it be right in the &s;ight of God, to hearken unto you more than

There is one Lawgiver, who is able to &s;ave and to de&s;troy: Who art thou that judge&s;t another? <HI>Mat.</HI> 15.9. But in vain they do wor|&s;hip me, teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of Men. <HI>Col.</HI> 2.22, Which all are to peri&s;h with the u&s;ing, after the Commandments and Doctrines of Men. <HI>Joh.</HI> 4.22.

<P>The&s;e are the Scriptures they quote for their Proof, with many more. All the&s;e quotations, quoted out of the Book of the Confe&s;&s;ion of their own Faith, with much more, was pre&s;ented to the above&s;aid Courts, Elders and Me&s;&s;engers of &s;aid Churches, with the following Que&s;ti|ons, grounded upon the &s;aid Confe&s;&s;ion of their own pre|tended Faith, but can obtain no An&s;wer but Violence to compell us to rebell again&s;t it, as will appear by &s;aid Que&s;tions as followeth.</P>

<P>I Reque&s;t of you, as you profe&s;s your&s;elves to be Chri&s;tians, and the Scripture to be your Rule, to give me a di|rect An&s;wer to the&s;e Scriptural Que&s;tions, Rom. 4, 15. <HI>For where no Law is, there is no Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>My Que&s;tion is, <HI>Hath God any Law to forbid Labour on the fir&s;t Day of the Week?</HI> If he hath, quote <HI>Chapter</HI> and <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> for it, to convict us of our Error, or be convict|ed that you will be found Fighters again&s;t God, in &s;tri|ving to compel us to wor&s;hip the works of your own hands, which would be Idolatry in us.</P>
<P>And con&s;ider, the Age and Antiquity of an Idol, doth not make the Sin one whit the le&s;s, but the greater; for God's Patience and Long Suffering towards Idolaters, &s;hould lead them to Repentance.</P>
<P>A Second Que&s;tion I crave of you is, <HI>Whether the Name Sabbath</HI> (which you impo&s;e upon the fir&s;t Day of the Week in your Law Book) <HI>be a Title that God by his Word hath put upon it?</HI> If it be, pray quote the <HI>Chapter</HI>

and <HI>Ver&s;e,</HI> where it is &s;o named by God's Word, If not, judge your Selves.</P>
<P>A third Que&s;tion I crave your An&s;wer to is, <HI>Whether the Name Lords Day</HI> (which you impo&s;e in your Law Book upon the fir&s;t Day of the Week) <HI>be a Scripture Name peculiarly to that Day?</HI> And how you prove the Reve|lations of Je&s;us Chri&s;t to <HI>John</HI> was upon the fir&s;t Day of the Week?</P>
<P>And if you cannot an&s;wer the &s;aid Que&s;tions by the Holy Scriptures, then I reque&s;t of you to read and to con&s;ider what is written, P&s;al. 94.20, 21. <HI>Shall the Throne of Iniquity have Fellow&s;hip with thee, which fra|meth mi&s;chief by a Law? They gather them&s;elves together again&s;t the Soul of the Righteous, and condemn the inno|cent Blood.</HI> From <HI>New-London</HI> Pri&s;on, the 17th of the 9th Month. 1719.</P>

<P>Upon this Con&s;ideration, I reque&s;t this Favour of you, &s;o that we may venture in with you in keeping of it, by a Commandment from God, if you know of any, for this will be more for your Honour than to compell us again&s;t our own Con&s;ciences, and (your own Coun&s;els) by your own Law, accompanied with your Whips, Stocks, Fines and Impri&s;onments, which hitherto you have been u&s;ing to compel us to offer in Divine Wor&s;hip, that which God hath not commanded; and be&s;ides this, we are a&s;ha|med (I do not &s;ay you) to pretend to be <HI>orthodox Chri&s;ti|ans,</HI> and to re&s;olve our Faith into Education, In&s;truction, and the Per&s;wa&s;ion of others, &s;eeing you &s;ay in your Con|fe&s;&s;ion, <HI>Page</HI> 6.

Upon this the common People was in an Uproar, and broke the Plank of the Window and let Light in: And one of the Lieutenants that came out of <HI>England,</HI> told me, he had been with the &s;aid Superiour Court, and de&s;ired that I might be brought forth to their View; and

they would &s;ee that I was under no Di&s;traction, and that they had ordered that I &s;hould be brought out to the Go|vernour in the Evening; but when it was dark Night, I was taken out by the Sheriff, and carried to the Go|vernour's Hou&s;e, into a private Room, and the Sheriff &s;ent out by the Governour, to &s;ee that the Yard was clear: But it is too much to write what was done to &s;ome that was found &s;tanding there; but the Body of them did run away. The Governour order'd the Sheriff to take me home with him, and keep me at his Hou&s;e, accordingly he did, and gave me a charge not to go out of his Yard, but &s;et no Body to look after me; but he him&s;elf tended on the &s;aid Court, but about two Days after, I was told that the Sheriff told a Friend of his, that he was order'd after the Court was broke up, and the People di&s;pers'd, to carry me up to <HI>Hartford</HI> Pri&s;on, and to &s;ee me &s;hut up in &s;ome dark Room, and that one <HI>Laboreell</HI> a French Doc|tor was to &s;have my head, and give me Purges to recover me of my Madne&s;s. I hearing of this, I de&s;ired the Sheriff to give me a Copy of the <HI>Mittimus,</HI> and after I told him what I heard privately, he owned the Truth of it, and that Night following, I got up, and got a Neighbour to acquaint my Son how Matters was circum&s;tanced, who brought 10 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> of Money for me, &amp; hired hands to row me o|ver to <HI>Long-I&s;land,</HI> and pulled off his own Shirt and gave me, and I got to <HI>Southold</HI> on <HI>Long-I&s;land</HI> in the Night, and early in the Morning, (it being the <HI>first Day of the Week</HI>) I went to a Ju&s;tice to give him an Account of the Matter, having told him that I got away from under the Sheriffs Hand at <HI>New-London:</HI> But he reply'd, <HI>It is the Sabbath, it is not a Day to Di&s;cour&s;e about &s;uch things.</HI> So I returned to the Tavern, and I &s;uppo&s;e it was not a|bove an Hour, before the Con&s;table came and &s;et a Guard over me, 'till about Nine or Ten of the Clok, <HI>the next Day,</HI> and then came for me,, where three Ju&s;tices was <HI>&s;it|ting at a Table,</HI> with a <HI>written Paper</HI> lying before them, and read a Law to me, <HI>That it was to be counted Felony, to break out of a Con&s;tables Hand.</HI> I then pre&s;ented a Copy of the <HI>Mittimus:</HI> They read it and de&s;ired to be in <HI>Private;</HI> and being brought before them again, they told

me, they did not look at me to be &s;uch a Per&s;on as I was there rendred, and &s;o di&s;charged me without any Charge: I told them, my de&s;ign was to their Governour for Protec|tion; and that I did expect Hue-and-cries to pur&s;ue me, and reque&s;ted of them to &s;top them if they did, they pro|mi&s;ed me they would, and after I heard they did &s;top them. I got a Man and Hor&s;e to go with me to <HI>York</HI> with all the &s;peed I could, and the fir&s;t Hou&s;e I went into, was Gover|nour <HI>Hunter</HI>'s in the Fort, and &s;hewed him the Mittimus, and gave him an account of matters; he told me he would not advi&s;e me to venture thither again, and that I &s;hould have &s;afe Protection. I told him I did expect Hue-and-cries to come after me: He told me I need not fear that at all, for &s;aid he, I have heard you differ in Opini|on from them, and they will be glad to be rid of you, and it is evident you are no &s;uch Man as they pretend: But the next Day about 10 of the Clock, there came 2 printed Hue-and-cries in at the Tavern where I was, &amp; I got them both, and went directly to the Governour, who was walk|ing alone on the Wall of the Fort, and delivered one of them to him, who read it, and then called to a little Man walking on the Pavement in the Fort, &s;aying, Mr. <HI>Bickly,</HI> Mr. <HI>Bickly,</HI> come hither, and when he was come, he read it, and &s;aid he, I grant Protection to this Man, he &s;hall not be &s;ent back upon this Hue-and-cry, and &s;aid he, I will write to the Governour of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> and to me he &s;aid, you are &s;afe enough here, I will grant you Protection. I told him, I did believe no An&s;wer would be returned him, accordingly he found my Words true, and advi&s;ed me to go for <HI>England,</HI> and make my Complaint, and told me there was a Ship then going from <HI>Pen&s;ilvania.</HI> A Mer|chant being then pre&s;ent, told me if I wanted Money, he would lend it me, and if I &s;hould never be able to pay him, he never would trouble me for it. All this Kindnefs have I met with from Strangers, but have thought it my Wi&s;dom to commit my Cau&s;e to the All &s;eeing God, and after I had continued in <HI>York</HI> about three Months, I re|turned home, and after I was recruited, with great difficul|ty I pro&s;ecuted the Judges of your &s;aid Inferiour Court, for you had made it &s;o difficult to Summon them, that

none could give forth a Summons but your General Court, in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, but when I with great difficulty brought it to your Court of Chancery, you non-&s;uited me, and or|dered me to pay all the Charges, and fined me 20 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> as above&s;aid.
