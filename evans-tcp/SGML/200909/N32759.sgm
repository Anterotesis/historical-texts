<HEAD>ADDITIONS To COMMON SENLE. AMERICAN INDEPENDANCY <HI>defended.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN the little pamphlet intitled COMMON SENSE fir&s;t made its appearance in favor of that &s;o often abjured idea of independance upon Great-Britain, I was informed that no le&s;s than three gentlemen of re&s;pectable abilities were engaged to an&s;wer it. As yet I have &s;een nothing which di|rectly pretends to di&s;pute a &s;ingle po&s;ition of the au|thor. The oblique e&s;&s;ay in Humphreys's paper, and &s;olemn Te&s;timony of the Quakers, however intended, having offered nothing to the purpo&s;e, I &s;hall take leave to examine this important que&s;tion, with all candor and attention, and &s;ubmit the re&s;ult to my much intere&s;ted country.</P>
<P>Dependance of one man, or &s;tate, upon another, is either ab&s;olute, or limited by &s;ome certain terms of agreement. The dependance of the&s;e colonies which Great-Britain calls <HI>con&s;titutional,</HI> as declared by act of parliament, is ab&s;olute. If the contrary of this be the bugbear &s;o many have been declaiming again&s;t, I could wi&s;h my countrymen would con&s;ider the con|&s;equence of &s;o &s;tupid a profe&s;&s;ion. If a limited de|pendance is intended, I would be much obliged to any one who will &s;hew me the <HI>Britanno American Magna Charta</HI> wherein the terms of our limited dependance are preci&s;ely &s;tated. If no &s;uch thing can be found, and <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> dependance be accounted inadmi&s;&s;ible the &s;ound we are &s;quabbling about has certainly no determinate meaning. If any &s;ay we mean that kind of dependance we acknowledge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> and before the
<PB N="4" REF="043053_0004_101CB158634649E8">
year 1763; I an&s;wer, <HI>vague and uncertain laws, and more e&s;pecially</HI> CONSTITUTIONS, are the very in&s;tru|ments of &s;lavery. The Magna Charta of England was very explicit, con&s;idering the time it was form|ed, and yet much blood was &s;pilt in di&s;putes concern|ing its meaning.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the danger of an indefinite dependance upon an undetermined power, it might be worth while to con&s;ider what the characters are on whom we are &s;o ready to acknowledge our&s;elves dependant. The votaries for this idol tell us, upon the good peo|ple of our Mother Country, whom they repre&s;ent as the mo&s;t ju&s;t, humane, and affectionate friends we can have in the world. Were this true, it were &s;ome encouragement; but who can pretend ignorance that the&s;e ju&s;t and humane friends are as much under the tyranny of men of a rever&s;e character as we &s;hould be, could tho&s;e mi&s;creants gain their ends? I di&s;claim any more than a mutual dependance on any man, or number of men upon earth; but ah indefinite depen|dance upon a combination of men, who have, in the face of the &s;un, broken thro' the mo&s;t &s;olemn cove|nants, debauched the hereditary, and corrupted the elective guardians of the people's rights, who have, in fact, e&s;tabli&s;hed an ab&s;olute tyranny in Great-Britain and Ireland, and openly declared them&s;elves <HI>competent to bind the Coloni&s;ts in all ca&s;es what&s;oever:</HI> I &s;ay indefinite de|pendance on &s;uch a combination of <HI>u&s;urping innovators</HI> is evidently as dangerous to liberty, as fatal to civil and &s;ocial happine&s;s, as any one &s;tep that could be propo&s;ed, even by the <HI>de&s;troyer of men.</HI> The utmo&s;t that the hone&s;t party in Great-Britain can do, is to warn us to avoid this dependance at all hazards? Does not even a Duke of Grafton declare the mini&s;terial mea&s;ures illegal and dangerous? And &s;hall America, no way connected with this admini&s;tration, pre&s;s our &s;ubmi&s;&s;i|on
<PB N="5" REF="043053_0005_101CB15D9EAB9FA0">
to &s;uch mea&s;ures, and reconciliation to the authors of them? Would not &s;uch pigeon-hearted wretches equally forward the recal of the Stuart family, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Popery throughout Chri&s;tendom, did they conceive the party in favor of tho&s;e loyal mea&s;ures the &s;tronge&s;t? Shame on the men who can court exemption from pre&s;ent trouble and expence, at the price of their own and po&s;terity's liberty! The hone&s;t party in England cannot wi&s;h for the reconci|liation propo&s;ed. It is as un&s;afe to them as to us, and they thoroughly apprehend it. What check have they now upon the crown, and what &s;hadow of control can they pretend, when the crown can com|mand fifteen or twenty millions a year, which they have nothing to &s;ay to? A proper proportion of our commerce is all that can benefit any good man in Britain or Ireland, and God forbid we &s;hould be &s;o cruel as to furni&s;h bad men with power to en&s;lave both Britain and America. Admini&s;tration has now fairly di&s;&s;evered the dangerous tie: Execrated will he be by the late&s;t po&s;terity who again joins the fatal co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">d! But &s;ay the puling pu&s;illanimous cowards, we &s;hall be &s;ubject to a long and bloody war, if we declare inde|pendance. On the contrary, I affirm it the only &s;tep that can bring the conte&s;t to a &s;peedy and happy i&s;&s;ue. By declairing independance we place our&s;elves on a footing for an equal negociation: Now we are called a pack of villainous rebels, who, like the St. Vincent Indians, can expect nothing more than a pardon for our lives, and the &s;overeign favor, re&s;pecting freedom and property, <HI>to be at the King's will.</HI> Grant Almighty God that I may be numbered with the dead before that fable day dawn on North-America!</P>
<P>All Europe knows the illegal and inhuman treat|ment we have received from Britons. All Europe Wi&s;hes the haughty empre&s;s of the main reduced to
<PB N="6" REF="043053_0006_101CB15F2DEAF970">
a more humble deportment. After her&s;elf has thru&s;t her Colonies from her, the maritime powers cannot be &s;uch idiots as to &s;uffer her to reduce them to a more ab&s;olute obedience of her dictates than they were here|tofore obliged to yield. Does not the mo&s;t &s;uperfici|al politician know that while we profe&s;s our&s;elves the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain, and yet hold arms again&s;t her, they have a right to treat us as rebels, and that according to the laws of nature and nations no other &s;tate has a right to interfere in the di&s;pute? But on the other hand, on our declaration of independance, the maratime &s;tates at lea&s;t will find it their intere&s;t, which always &s;ecures the que&s;tion of inclination, to protect a people who can be &s;o advantageous to them. So that tho&s;e &s;hort-&s;ighted politicians, who conclude that this &s;tep will involve us in &s;laughter and deva&s;ta|tion, may plainly perceive that no mea&s;ure in our power will &s;o naturally and effectually work our deli|verance. The motion of a &s;inger of the Grand Mo|narch would procure as gentle a temper in the Omni|potent Briti&s;h Mini&s;ter as appeared in the Manilla ran|&s;om and Falkland i&s;lands affairs. From without cer|tainly we have every thing to hope, nothing to fear; from within, &s;ome tell us the Pr&eacute;&s;byterians, if freed from the re&s;training power of Great-Britain, would over-run the peceable Quakers in this government. For my own part, I de&s;pi&s;e and dete&s;t the bickerings of &s;ectaries, and am apprehen&s;ive of no trouble from that quarter, e&s;pecially while no peculiar honors nor emoluments are annexed to either. I heartily wi&s;h too many of the Quakers did not give cau&s;e of com|plaint, by endeavoring to counteract the mea&s;ures of their fellow citizens for the common &s;afety. If they profe&s;s them&s;elves only pilgrims here, let them walk through the men of this world without interfering with their actions on either &s;ide. If they would not

<HI>pull down Kings,</HI> let them not <HI>&s;upport tyrants;</HI> for whe|ther they under&s;tand it or not, there is, and ever has been, an e&s;&s;ential difference in the characters.</P>
<P>Finally, with M. De Vatell, I account <HI>a &s;tate a mo|ral per&s;on having an intere&s;t and will of its own,</HI> and I think that &s;tate a mon&s;ter, who&s;e prime mover has an intere&s;t and will, in direct oppo&s;ition to its pro&s;perity and &s;ecurity. This po&s;ition has been &s;o clearly de|mon&s;trated in the pamphlet fir&s;t mentioned in this e&s;|&s;ay, that I &s;hall only add, if there are any arguments in favor of returning to a &s;tate of dependance on Great-Britain, that is on the pre&s;ent Admini&s;tration of Great-Britain, I could wi&s;h they were timely offered, that they may be &s;oberly con&s;idered, before the cunning propo&s;als of the cabinet &s;et all the timid, lazy and ir|re&s;olute members of the community into a clamor for <HI>peace at any rate.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ADDITIONS TO COMMON SENSE. <HI>The Propriety of</HI> INDEPENDANCY.</HEAD>
<P>TO acknowledge that the Creator formed Man for &s;ociety, and that &s;ociety cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t with|out regulations, laws, and government; and at the &s;ame time to a&s;&s;ert, that in &s;pight of all human care to prevent it, every government will degenerate into a tyranny, is &s;uch a daring <HI>bla&s;phemy</HI> of the <HI>divine at|tribute,</HI> that had I not heard it a&s;&s;erted, and acquie&s;ced in as a truth, I could not have believed &s;uch a po&s;iti|on could have obtained in a civilized country! This mon&s;trous hypothe&s;is concludes that notwith&s;tanding the Deity had power enough to form &s;uch admirable creatures as men and women, and fit them for enjoy|ing
<PB N="8" REF="043053_0008_101CB16697F76BF8">
of each other a thou&s;and ways, and tho' by means of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite of tho&s;e enjoyments a race &s;hould ari&s;e from them over which every power of rightful government mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be exerci&s;ed, yet ju&s;t and rightful government is in reality utopian, imagi|nary, and impracticable! Did not God cloath the gra&s;s, direct the wild Goat and provide for the Sparrow, I might more ea&s;ily be per&s;uaded to &s;u&s;pect his care of Man.</P>
<P>I readily grant that the delegates of governmental power are too apt to con&s;ider them&s;elves the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of it <HI>in their own right,</HI> and that they therefore take every means in their power to become the <HI>ma&s;ters</HI> in place of <HI>&s;ervants</HI> to their <HI>con&s;tituents;</HI> and that the peo|ple in all civilized countries have been too inattentive to the u&s;erpations of their rulers: But I conceive of no cau&s;e in the nature of things which &s;o ab&s;olutely counteracts the power of a wi&s;e, learned, and free community as to render it impo&s;&s;ible for them to pre|&s;erve their liberty. The arguments brought from the condition of other &s;tates, are by no means conclu&s;ive with re&s;pect to the North-American colonies. I am hold to a&s;&s;ert, that &s;uch a favourable combination of circum&s;tances as they are ble&s;&s;ed with at this impor|tant conjuncture, never did take place among any people with whom hi&s;tory has made us acquainted. The mo&s;t ju&s;t and &s;olid foundation of &s;ocial happine&s;s was laid in the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of the Continent, <HI>the cultivation of the earth for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tance of its proprietor.</HI> Here was no feudal tenure from &s;ome military Lord; every cultivator being the lord of his own &s;oil, and content with its produce, had no thoughts of en|croaching upon and &s;ubjecting his neighbour to his ab&s;olute dominion. Hence a hand&s;ome competency has enabled the bulk of the people to give their chil|dren &s;uch an education as enables them to read, and
<PB N="9" REF="043053_0009_101CB16A2AE49F10">
become acquainted with the u&s;urpations of the deepe&s;t plotters of their ruin. The &s;pirit of the people for obtaining this nece&s;&s;ary information, is evident from the incredible number of news-papers and other peri|odical publications which they encourage, and the effect of &s;uch in&s;titutions never have been &s;o great in any community, yet known, as in the&s;e <HI>pantaplebean (altogether</HI> Commons) colonies. How quickly the mo&s;t important revolution of the fundamentals of our policy can pervade a continent, may be gue&s;&s;ed at by the progre&s;s of the idea of Colonial Independancy in three weeks or a month at farthe&s;t! Surely thou&s;ands and tens of thou&s;ands of common farmers and trade&s;|men mu&s;t be better rea&s;oners than &s;ome of our tram|melled <HI>juris con&s;ultors,</HI> who to this hour feel a reluct|ance to part with the abominable chain, which re|maining, in any &s;hape whatever, tho' modified by all the wi&s;dom and caution of the greate&s;t men now li|ving, mu&s;t in a very little time drag the colonies into the mo&s;t abject &s;lavery. Many profe&s;s them&s;elves zealous for the liberties of America, yet declare an abhorrence of the idea of independancy on Great-Britain. If this be not a &s;oleci&s;m, as ab&s;urd and irre|concileable as ever wad obtruded on mankind, I know not the meaning of the term! <HI>Civil Liberty</HI> never was defined in &s;tricter terms than <HI>an</HI> EXEMPTION <HI>from all controul,</HI> WITHOUT THE COMMUNITY, <HI>in which every qualified member has an equal voice.</HI> No American, as &s;uch, has the &s;hadow of incorporation with the go|vernment of Great-Britain; and in con&s;equence, if he receives the lea&s;t &s;yllable of law from that quarter, he gives up his claim to the definitive exemption. if the &s;ticklers for <HI>dependance</HI> do not mean dependance for &s;ome certain laws, in the forming of which the Co|loni&s;ts have no voice at all, I do not yet under&s;tand them; and if they do mean that we &s;hould admit the
<PB N="10" REF="043053_0010_101CB16F2FC19600">
<HI>claim</HI> of any &s;tate, or any part of the power of any &s;tate, with which the democratic power of this &s;tate is not incorporated, to give us law <HI>in any ca&s;e what|ever,</HI> they admit a fibre, which I mu&s;t make free to tell them, will &s;peedily grown into an <HI>iron &s;inew</HI> which neither them&s;elves nor po&s;terity will be able to endure or bur&s;t a&s;under. And further, it is not only the ad|mi&s;&s;ion of &s;ome po&s;&s;ible law from a foreign power, that hurries a people into &s;lavery; a meer negative power on acts for the repeal of grieveous laws will more &s;lowly, but as certainly &s;ubvert liberty.</P>
<P>Again Mr. Hume's ob&s;ervation, [<HI>Perfect Common|wealth,</HI> p. 301.] that "the &s;word being in the hands of a &s;ingle per&s;on who will <HI>always neglect to di&s;cipline the militia,</HI> in order to have the pretext to <HI>keep up a &s;tanding army;"</HI> and the &s;ucceeding one, "that this is a mortal di&s;temper in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> government of which it <HI>mu&s;t, at la&s;t inevitably peri&s;h,"</HI> now &s;o fatally con|firmed, may be a &s;ufficient warning to the Colonies to <HI>beware of being again entangled with the yoke of bondage.</HI></P>
<P>Many object to a Republican Government as im|practicable in a large &s;tate. "The contrary of this (&s;ays Hume, [<HI>Per. Com.</HI> 302.] &s;eems evident. Tho' 'tis more difficult to form a Republican Government in an exten&s;ive country than in a city; there is more facility, when once it is formed, of pre&s;erving it &s;teady and uniform, without tumult or faction, in the former then the latter. (<HI>Per. Com.</HI> 303.) In a large government which is modelled with ma&s;terly &s;kill, there is compa&s;s and room enough to refine the democracy from the lower people, who may be ad|mitted into the fir&s;t elections, or fir&s;t concoction of the commonwealth; to the higher magi&s;trates who direct all the motions. At the &s;ame time the parts are &s;o di&s;tant and remote that 'tis very difficult either by in|trigue, prejudice, or pa&s;&s;ion, to hurry them into mea|&s;ures

<P>NATURE in&s;tructs the brute creation to provide for, guard and protect their offspring until they are able to do for them&s;elves. The dam is never known to for&s;ake her young while her care is nece&s;&s;a|ry for their &s;afety, nor to do any thing which would involve them in di&s;tre&s;s and difficulty. Man, who has this principle in common with brutes, is endowed with others yet more valuable, but which to him are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, whereby he is taught to provide for the future welfare of his de&s;cendants and to guard them from the encroachments of that power which civil &s;ociety con&s;titutes for its own &s;afety; but which, through the depravity of human nature is often tur|ned again&s;t it. There are few parents who do not make it their con&s;tant &s;tudy and earne&s;t endeavour to leave &s;ome valuable inheritance to their children: few who have been &s;o lo&s;t to the feelings of nature and calls of parental affection, as to entail difficulty and di&s;tre&s;s on their children, when it was in their power to leave them a fair and ea&s;y inheritance. And yet it has &s;o happened, that by an ill timed attachment to the pre&s;ent, without paying proper attention to the future, they have entailed mi&s;ery upon them by the very means which were de&s;igned to pre&s;erve them from it.</P>
<P>It is now in your power to bequeath to your chil|dren the one or the other, and it becomes you to have
<PB N="12" REF="043053_0012_101CB17850ACB510">
an eye to them in all your proceedings. It is &s;uffici|ently known to you, that riches in arbitrary &s;tates are often the ruin of then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, and that &s;ecuri|ty to property is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tamp their true value on wealth and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. He therefore, who wi&s;hes to leave his children in flouri&s;hing cir|cum&s;tances ought to be a zealous friend to tho&s;e mea|&s;ures, and that plan of government which gives the greate&s;t &s;ecurity to property, and an active warm op|po&s;er of tho&s;e which leave it to the arbitrary di&s;po&s;al of men, who find a greater advantage in making free with what does not belong to them, than in frugally u&s;ing what is ju&s;tly their own. Whig and Tory &s;hould be out of the que&s;tion. Private pique, party faction and animo&s;ity ought to &s;ub&s;ide. He who thinks &s;hould think for po&s;terity, and he who acts &s;hould act for his children.</P>
<P>It is a great weakne&s;s to &s;uffer our pa&s;&s;ions to take place of our rea&s;on and blindly to follow their dic|tates, though to our manife&s;t hurt, rather than &s;ub|ject them to our better &s;en&s;e. A fal&s;e pride, which will not acknowledge an error though ever &s;o evi|dent, an ob&s;tinate per&s;everance in our own opinion without deigning to hear advice or in&s;truction, and an unrea&s;onable attachment to party, have done much mi&s;chief to mankind, and may yet do more if not carefully avoided. I have directed this paper to you in preference to others, becau&s;e your parental affecti|on &s;hould form more than a counterpoi&s;e to every fal&s;e principle, which can influence the human mind where the intere&s;t of your offspring is at &s;take.</P>
<P>Our pre&s;ent conte&s;t is immen&s;ely great, and every man mu&s;t &s;ee that it will affect po&s;terity. Its con&s;e|quences cannot end with it&s;elf; but the late&s;t genera|tions mu&s;t feel its effects. The great Ruler of the univer&s;e has permitted it for wi&s;e purpo&s;es and has
<PB N="13" REF="043053_0013_101CB179ED9F17A8">
called every one of us to act our part in it. It becomes us, therefore, laying a&s;ide all former prejudices, parti|ality and party attachments, to act upon principles which will ju&s;tify us to him who has a&s;&s;igned us our &s;tations, and cau&s;e po&s;terity to ble&s;s the memory of their forefathers. We all agree in this, that Great-Britain is unju&s;t and arbitrary, and we have hitherto principally differed in the mode of oppo&s;ition, which ought to have been pur&s;ued. I &s;peak not to tho&s;e who think one way and talk another. They act up|on &s;uch ba&s;e principles, that it is in vain to attempt to rouze in them any ju&s;t or generous &s;entiments. We have no in&s;tances of the conver&s;ion of avaricious or ambitious hypocrites, and it would be wa&s;ting time to u&s;e arguments to convince them. I direct my&s;elf to you who have &s;incerity &s;ufficient to examine the principles on which you proceed, and hone&s;ty enough to pur&s;ue that cour&s;e of conduct which appears to be right, and &s;o much affection for your children as to prefer their intere&s;t and happine&s;s to every other con|&s;ideration. For you I mean to throw together a few hints which may a&s;&s;i&s;t you in finally fixing a right choice.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h admini&s;tration began its attacks on our liberties with a &s;tamp act, but meeting with &s;trong oppo&s;ition they thought fit to repeal it. This act threw the colonies into &s;trong convul&s;ions, and we rejoiced exceedingly on its repeal, and fondly hoped that we would enjoy future tranquility. But we were mi&s;ta|ken. They never intended to relinqui&s;h the de&s;ign, but only to change their ground, that which they fir&s;t pitched upon not &s;eeming tenable. An American re|venue granted by a Briti&s;h Parliament was the object, and they never lo&s;t &s;ight of it; for they &s;oon renewed their attacks upon principles which they thought more favourable to their intentions; but meeting with as

little &s;ucce&s;s in that, as in the preceding attempt, they &s;u&s;pended their mea&s;ures for a time, in, hopes of lul|ling us into a carele&s;s &s;ecurity. They accordingly once more returned to the charge, and endeavoured to effect by cunning and artifice what they had here|tofore attempted in vain on every other peaceable plan. This not &s;ucceeding, they were reduced to their la&s;t &s;hift of bullying and force; and this they re&s;olved upon. They levied armies, appointed Generals of reputation to command, and &s;ent them among&s;t us, we may know their commi&s;&s;ion by their conduct; for after abu&s;ing, brow-beating and in&s;ulting, after &s;tar|ving and tarring and feathering, after offering every po&s;&s;ible injury which a free people could bear, with|out obtaining their ends, and every other mea&s;ure failing, they drew the &s;word, and at once reduced us to the dire alternative of &s;ubmitting to their illegal claims of juri&s;diction, or entering into the bloody con|te&s;t. Like men determined to be free we cho&s;e the latter. It now re&s;ts on the la&s;t argument, an argu|ment which finally &s;ettles all controver&s;ies of a like nature. The plan of operation is now opened, and they who &s;tand to it with the mo&s;t &s;teady per&s;eve|rance mu&s;t finally &s;ucceed. This is the decree of pro|vidence in all ca&s;es, <Q>he that per&s;evereth unto the end &s;hall be &s;aved.</Q> We have, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, effectually baffled all their former attempts; but if we fail in this, all our former victories will only &s;erve to make our fall the more con&s;picuous and terrible.</P>
<P>I will not enquire what would have been the efficacy of any heretofore recommended, but untried means. The wor&s;t that can has happened, and it is with it we have now to deal; to relinqui&s;h it on our part, would be to give up the matter, for however any means might once have done, cowardice alone would now de&s;ert the field, and &s;lavery mu&s;t be the inevitable con&s;e|quence.</P>

I do not wonder that war &s;its heavy on us, and that we are &s;omewhat re&s;tle&s;s and unea&s;y; but I &s;hall be &s;urprized, if we, who have &s;o long and &s;o &s;uce&s;sfully oppo&s;ed tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion &s;hould all on a &s;ud|den lo&s;e every de&s;ire of retaining our liberties. I am forced into this remark by the artful, cunning and de&s;igning manner in which &s;ome men talk of a recon|ciliation with Great Britain; and the bug-bears they conjure up to frighten the timid, irre&s;olute and igno|rant, from a &s;teady pro&s;ecution of tho&s;e means, which alone can help us in our pre&s;ent circum&s;tances. Facts bear evidence from the beginning of the conte&s;t that every &s;cheme they ever recommended has, upon trial, proved inadequate to the end for which it was inten|ded; yet they proceed. Beware of &s;uch men, they love neither their country, nor their liberties, &s;o much as &s;omething el&s;e.</P>
<P>There are many I doubt not who are denominated Tories by the more zealous Whigs, who in their hearts wi&s;h &s;ucce&s;s to our mea&s;ures, tho' they maybe chagrined becau&s;e tho&s;e they propo&s;ed did not go down with the people; the&s;e are uniform, open, and not very dan|gerous; but there are others, who under the cloke of friend&s;hip for the cau&s;e, harbour the bittere&s;t ran|cour and malice in their hearts. The&s;e talk favoura|bly in general, though their di&s;cour&s;es mo&s;tly termi|nate with a <HI>doubt, &s;u&s;picion,</HI> or <HI>but,</HI> which give tho&s;e with whom they conver&s;e, rea&s;on to dread &s;ome hid|den de&s;ign, or approaching evil, which mo&s;t men have not properly attended to. They artfully recal your attention to a certain period, when all was peace and quietne&s;s, and by pathetically lamenting the unhappy alteration, endeavour to impre&s;s your minds with an opinion that all our troubles aro&s;e from our&s;elves. They carefully avoid mentioning the iniquitous mea|&s;ures of the Briti&s;h government which produced them,

and by keeping tho&s;e out of &s;ight, they gradually lead the unwary into the belief, that the men who have been mo&s;t active on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion in oppo&s;ing the tyrannical proceedings of Great-Britain, and who have hazarded their all in defence of their country, have been actuated by &s;ini&s;ter motives in all they have done. If every man who hears &s;uch in&s;inuations were to a&s;k tho&s;e who ca&s;t them out, what mea&s;ures have not the men they condemn tried at one time or ano|ther to avoid the pre&s;ent conte&s;t, and &s;ave our liber|ties? What advantages they can reap by a &s;ucce&s;sful end of it, which every other freeman on the conti|nent will not reap equally with them? And in an un|&s;ucce&s;sful clo&s;e of it, all will allow they mu&s;t be the greate&s;t &s;ufferers. Their lives mu&s;t go, let who will el&s;e e&s;cape. The&s;e que&s;tions might recal them to facts, and the&s;e facts would enable men to judge aright.</P>
<P>Hone&s;ty could not &s;tand the force of a few perti|nent que&s;tions, but the&s;e men have taken their leave of it, and like Mana&s;&s;eh of old, have &s;old them&s;elves to do wickedly. Were it not &s;o, could it be po&s;&s;ible for them in the face of the &s;un, to charge all our trou|bles on the New-England Pre&s;byterians, troubles which originally began and have all along been kept up by a wicked admini&s;tration and a venal parliament. To make them the hatchers of mi&s;chiefs occa&s;ioned by uncon&s;titutional acts of parliament, and the only fomenters of our ju&s;t oppo&s;ition with a Penn&s;ylvani|an Quaker, a Maryland and a Virginian Churchman did more to effect than all the other men on the conti|nent put together, is cruelty in the extreme. My heart bleeds when I think of &s;uch men; who would fell the whole continent and all the blood on it for private advantage, and with whom a few thou&s;and, guineas with a title would be e&s;teemed an equivalent for the lives, liberty and property of the freemen of

But let them do as they plea&s;e, we ought to act wi&s;ely. If we do not make &s;uch a &s;ettlement now as will &s;ecure the privileges we contend for to po&s;terity, we entail either &s;lavery or a civil war on our children. This is certain, let what will be doubtful. Look round you then, view your offsprings and tell me, are you willing to leave them &s;uch a le|gacy? Do not trifle on this occa&s;ion, all your other legacies mu&s;t derive their true value from the part you now take in this conte&s;t. Thintk not that the God who charges him with wor&s;e than infidelity who provides not for his own, and tho&s;e of his hou&s;hold, will ju&s;tify you in returning to the &s;tate you were in when our troubles began, and thereby delivering over your offspring to the mi&s;chievous machinations of at power that from the beginning has &s;et right, ju&s;tice, and mercy at defiance, and in all her deliberations con&s;idered nothing but her ability to execute.</P>
<P>Look to the year 1763, that happy period, as many &s;o fondly call it, and &s;ee what &s;afety there is to Ame|rica in &s;uch a &s;ituation.

Can any man in his &s;en&s;es believe, that he who has &s;o long, and &s;o invariably pur&s;ued his point again&s;t the &s;en&s;e of the be&s;t men in the nation, will finally de&s;ert his ma&s;ter's mo&s;t favourite &s;cheme &s;o ea&s;ily? Has he uttered a &s;ingle &s;yllable that can make the mo&s;t cre|dulous believe that he is convinced of the inju&s;tice of his conduct? He confe&s;&s;es he was deceived; but wherein lay the deception: In believing that fewer troops would effect a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion than he is now con|vinced mu&s;t be employed. Here lay the deception he complains of, and he is therefore determined to &s;end his terms with &s;uch an armed force; as he expects will frighten you into a compliance. Does this look like the conduct of one who de&s;igns to relinqui&s;h his claims? Were he or his ma&s;ter &s;en&s;ible of the inju&s;tice of their proceedings &amp; the wrongs they have done us, they would both &s;peak a very different language. Why does he call you rebels? Why call in foreign troops to his aid? Why does his ma&s;ter lament &s;o pathetically, that the exten&s;ive operations of the war he means to carry on again&s;t you, will exhau&s;t his funds and in|crea&s;e the public debts, while he has not a &s;ingle tear to &s;hed, not a groan, nor as much as a &s;igh for all the blood he has already &s;pilt, and yet means to &s;pill, if he wi&s;hes to allow you &s;ecurity to your privileges?

Let me tell thee, O King, that there is a God who &s;ees through the veil that covers thy deceit, and who hears the cry of the needy, and regards the prayer of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, who will recom|pence vengeance on the wicked, though &s;upported by the power of Great Britain. Our weakne&s;s is &s;uffici|ent in his hands for the purpo&s;e. If thine and thy mini&s;ters intentions are not evil again&s;t us, why did&s;t thou not hearken to the repeated prayers of thy di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed &s;ubjects in America? why do&s;t thou not recal thy troops, repeal the acts, indemnify us for what we have &s;uffered, and offer any further &s;ecurity to our rights, which we may think nece&s;&s;ary? Thou began|e&s;t the attack and this is thy duty; be&s;ides, thou ha&s;t an obedient parliament, which di&s;putes not thy will, and all this is in thy power, and in no one's el&s;e." Had the King made a &s;peech to the hou&s;e recommend|ing the&s;e things, he would have given unequivocal proof of his hone&s;t intentions, and it might ju&s;tly be termed gracious. But who can tru&s;t a Prince, who while he &s;peaks the language of peace and humanity with his lips, has nothing but cruelty and war in his conduct. The man who does, may have the inno|cence of the dove, but he cannot be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed or the wi&s;dom of the &s;erpent. I conclude by entreating you, that as you love your children, and their happine&s;s, you never de&s;ert your pre&s;ent oppo&s;ition, until you obtain &s;uch a plan of con&s;titutional vigour, as &s;hall put it at all times in your power to &s;ecure your&s;elves, and your de&s;cendants from tyrannical encroachments. This you never had, nor never can have on the plan of your former dependance.

Had his Lord&s;hip entirely forgot the &s;ucce&s;s of his former experiment, perhaps a trial of the &s;ame wretched <HI>trick</HI> over again, might have appeared le&s;s rediculous. I may indeed &s;ay, le&s;s in&s;ulting to the lowe&s;t under|&s;tanding. I would a&s;k the mo&s;t credulous votary for making up the di&s;pute, what <HI>po&s;&s;ible grounds</HI> they per|ceive to found their expectation of a permanent recon|ciliation upon? Has any thing lately turned up, which has indicated a change of di&s;po&s;ition in the Prince or his favorites? Can a majority, which have been &s;ecu|red from one &s;even years to another, by pure force of corruption, be depended on to remain firm to a &s;laugh|tering, plundering and de&s;olating court, and &s;hare the dete&s;tation of pre&s;ent and future ages, for mere no|thing? Has the court re&s;olved to ca&s;t Bernard, Hutch|in&s;on and daughter, Richard&s;on the Murderer, cra|zy John Malcom, and Richard&s;on the recent volunteer, out on the common? I tell you, nay!

national debt, rather than go on augmenting is by their efforts to &s;addle it, with an unlimited pen&s;ion li&s;t, on America. Does the nation bear the weight of the pre&s;ent unnatural quarrel with America on other terms, than a firm a&s;&s;urance of the Court, that millions of leading men's dependant's &s;hall be provided for in America, for whom places can by no means be found at home. Is not the very genius of the people of Great-Britain and Ireland corrupted, in&s;omuch, that the views of young fellows of education, or any con|nection with men of note, are altogether &s;et on pub|lic money? Can our peaceable men indulge a gleam of hope, that this humour will alter, or that youths, bred in idlene&s;s and di&s;&s;ipation, will become indu&s;tri|ous and di&s;intere&s;ted patriots? If not, they mu&s;t then be &s;o weak as to conceit, that mini&s;ters will become le&s;s fond of fingering the public money, and &s;ecuring them&s;elves in places of power and profit by means of it; indeed, that they will become more hone&s;t and &s;aving of the national money than tho&s;e the con&s;ti|tution has appointed as a check upon them. It is no wonder they tell of &s;ending a formidable fleet and army to bring over their terms of reconciliation, when they are in no one article different from the terms they fir&s;t aimed to impo&s;e. Had the mini&s;ter, or more pro|perly the ob&s;tinate author of all our troubles, had the remote&s;t idea of favouring us with a government of laws, which had any re&s;pect to the &s;ecurity of our lives and properties, he had long &s;ince granted with a good grace, petitions, made and repeated with the mo&s;t dutiful and per&s;evering affection, which a&s;ked for nothing more! <HI>Sed aut Cae&s;ar aut nullus,</HI> &s;eems the unalterable determination of the man, who &s;oothed our already elated expectations, by an inaugural de|claration, that he <HI>gloried</HI> in the name of Briton, at that time, a di&s;tinctive characteri&s;tic of the patrons of uni|ver&s;al

If therefore the whole body of the governing, and influential part of the governed in Great Britain, be unalterably &s;et upon extorting tri|bute from the Colonies; and the better to &s;ecure the collection of it, claims right to impo&s;e the laws, and executors of tho&s;e laws, dependant only on them&s;elves for appointment, continuance and &s;upport; and all the&s;e to be extended at their &s;ole plea&s;ure, it may rea|dily be determined in what condition, the ab&s;olutely pa&s;&s;ive &s;ubjects of &s;uch an unnatural u&s;urpation would quickly be. It is evident they have concluded on two things, viz. to make a bold pu&s;h for our entire &s;ub|jection, as their ends would be thereby more readily an&s;wered; but that being found impracticable, we are to be tried with negociation, in which all the craft, duplicity and punic faith of admini&s;tration is to be ex|pected. Pray God it may be wi&s;ely and firmly guard|ed again&s;t! The worthy and honourable John Collins, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR>; of New-Port, Rhode I&s;land, on the arrival of Lord North's la&s;t conciliatory plan, ob&s;erved, that not|with&s;tanding the expo&s;ure of his large &s;tate, to what|ever depredations the enemy &s;aw fit to make upon it, he was more concerned for the probable &s;ucce&s;s of their arts than arms. Had the Americans in general the wi&s;dom and firmne&s;s of that gentleman matters would not have come to the pre&s;ent melancholy lengths we find them. However, in the great and general plan of him who putteth down and &s;etteth up &s;tates, this is doubtle&s;s an indi&s;pen&s;ible part, and therefore not to be complained of; but it has amazed me to con|template the numerous in&s;tances of di&s;appointment our enemies have met with, in every plot they have laid for our de&s;truction. How did Bernard and Hutchin&s;on flatter them&s;elves with the number of friends they had in &s;everal towns of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and thought that a very trifling force, from the other
<PB N="26" REF="043053_0026_101CB1AD1BBC6338">
&s;ide of the water, added to their minions, dependants and expectants, would cru&s;h a little turbulent faction, who di&s;turbed their darling mea&s;ures? Certainly men intoxicated with a lu&s;t of ab&s;olute power found &s;ome|thing in the appearance of things to tole them on to an object &s;o grateful to their fonde&s;t wi&s;hes; other|wi&s;e they would have been contented to augment and confirm their power by &s;uch unperceived degrees that the <HI>happy days,</HI> many tell us we have enjoyed under a continual invading u&s;urpation, would not yet have been &s;o &s;en&s;ibly interrupted. No le&s;s has the &s;o often extolled Gov. Try on been di&s;appointed in his benevolent intentions re&s;pecting New-York. His band on Long I&s;land, and on the ea&s;t &s;ide of Hud&s;on's river, with Sir John John&s;on among his va&s;&s;als, and the Indians, gave him great hopes of having matters in a fine train be|fore the invincible armada arrived in the &s;pring; in|&s;tead of which, it is probable the active General Lee will &s;o fortify that place, that all the force they can &s;end again&s;t it, will be in&s;ufficient to reduce it. Dun|more, with all his wanton ravage, has done little more than exa&s;perate the Virginians, and convinced that brave colony, that they can be formidable to &s;avages on the ea&s;t, as well as we&s;t &s;ide of their dominion. Carleton's Canadians, make no &s;uch figure in the harrangues of the pen&s;ioner, as they did la&s;t year; and in ca&s;e foreigners are to be procured to be poured in upon us, the greate&s;t oppo&s;ers of our total &s;eparation from Britain acknowledge, they would then no longer defer a declaration of independancy, and application to other powers for their protection. To this the whole &s;cene appears rapidly advancing, in my view, as ha&s;tily as infinite wi&s;dom thinks proper to conduct it; and if this be his mo&s;t gracious de&s;ign, he will work, and none &s;hall hinder.

<HEAD>COMMON SENSE. APPENDIX TO COMMON SENSE. <HI>The nece&s;&s;ity of</HI> INDEPENDANCY.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE the publication of the fir&s;t edition of this pamphlet, or rather on the &s;ame day on which it came out, the King's Speech made its appearance in this city. Had the &s;pirit of prophecy directed the birth of this production, it could not have brought it forth, at a more &s;ea&s;onable juncture, or a more nece&s;&s;ary time. The bloody mindedne&s;s of the one &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity of pur&s;uing the doctrine of the other. Men read by way of revenge. And the Speech, in&s;tead of terrifying, prepared a way for the manly principles of Independance.</P>
<P>Ceremony, and even &s;ilence, from whatever mo|tive they may ari&s;e, have a hurtful tendency, when they give the lea&s;t degree of countenance to ba&s;e and wicked performances; wherefore, if this maxim be admitted, it naturally follows, that the King's Speech, as being a piece of fini&s;hed villainy, de&s;erved, and &s;till de&s;erves, a general execration, both by the Congre&s;s and the people. Yet, as the dome&s;tic tranquility of a nation, depends greatly on the <HI>cha&s;tity</HI> of what may properly be called NATIONAL MANNERS, it is often better, to pa&s;s &s;ome things over in &s;ilent di&s;dain, than to make u&s;e of &s;uch new methods of di&s;like, as might introduce the lea&s;t inovation, on that guardian of our peace and &s;afety. And perhaps, it is chiefly owing to this prudent delicacy, that the King's Speech hath not, before now, &s;uffered a public execution. The &s;peech
<PB N="28" REF="043053_0028_101CB1B44BA8ECA0">
if it may be called one, is nothing better than a wilful audacious libel again&s;t the truth, the common good, and the exi&s;tence of mankind; and is a formal and pompous method of offering up human &s;acrifices, to the pride of tyrants. But this general ma&s;&s;acre of mankind, is one of the privileges, and the certain con|&s;equence of king's; for as nature knows them <HI>not,</HI> they know <HI>not her,</HI> and although they are beings of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> creating they know not <HI>us,</HI> and are become the gods of their creators. The &s;peech hath one good quality, which is, that it is not calculated to deceive, neither can we, even if we would, be deceived by it. Brutality and tyranny appear on the face of it. It leaves us at no lo&s;s: And every line convinces, even in the moment of reading, that he, who hunts the woods for prey, the naked and untutored Indian, is le&s;s a &s;avage than the King of Britain.</P>
<P>Sir John Dalrymple, the putative father of a whining Je&s;uitical piece, fallaciou&s;ly called, <HI>"The addre&s;s of the people of</HI> England, <HI>to the Inhabitants of</HI> America," hath, perhaps, from a vain &s;uppo&s;ition, that the people <HI>here</HI> went to be frightened at the pomp and de&s;cription of a king giving, (though very unwi&s;ely on his part) the real character of the pre&s;ent one: "But," &s;ays the writer, "if you are inclined to pay compliments to an admini&s;tration which we do not complain of, (mean|ing the Marquis of Rockingham's at the repeal of the Stamp act, it is very unfair in you to withhold them from that prince <HI>by who&s;e</HI> NOD ALONE, <HI>they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> any thing."</HI> This is toryi&s;m with a witne&s;s! <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> even without a ma&s;k: And he who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> and dige&s;t &s;uch doctrine, hath forfeit. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> to rationality&mdash;an apo&s;tate from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">, and ought to be con&s;idered&mdash;as one, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> not only given up the proper dignity of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;unk him&s;elf beneath the rank of animals,

and contemptibly crawl through the world like a worm.</P>
<P>However, it matters very little now, what the king of England either &s;ays or does; he hath wickedly broken though every moral and human obligation, tramp|led nature and con&s;cience beneath his feet; and by a &s;teady and con&s;titutional &s;pirit of in&s;olence and cruel|ty, procured for him&s;elf an univer&s;al hatred. It is <HI>now</HI> the intere&s;t of America to provide for her&s;elf. She hath already a large and young family, whom it is more her duty to take care of, than to be granting away her property, to &s;upport a power, who is be|come a reproach to the names of men and chri&s;tians, YE, who&s;e office it is to watch over the morals of a nation, of what&s;oever &s;ect or denomination ye are of, as well as ye, who, are more immediately the guardi|ans of the public liberty, if ye wi&s;h to pre&s;erve your native country uncontaminated by European corrup|tion, ye mu&s;t in &s;ecret wi&s;h a &s;eperation&mdash;But leaving the moral part to private reflection, I &s;hall chiefly con|fine my farther remarks to the following heads:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That it is the intere&s;t of America, to be &s;epe|rated from Britain.</P>
<P>Secondly; Which is the ea&s;ie&s;t and mo&s;t practicable plan, reconciliation or independance? with &s;ome occa|&s;ional remarks.</P>
<P>In &s;upport of the fir&s;t, I could, if I judged it pro|per, produce the opinion of &s;ome of the able&s;t and mo&s;t experienced men on this continent; and who&s;e &s;entiments, on that head, are not yet publicly known. It is in reality a &s;elf evident po&s;ition: For no nation, in a &s;tate of foreign dependance, limited in its com|merce, and cramped and &s;ettered in its legi&s;lative powers, can ever arrive at at any material eminence. America doth not yet know what opulence is; and although the progre&s;s which &s;he hath made, &s;tands unparalleled in the hi&s;tory of other nations, it is but
<PB N="30" REF="043053_0030_101CB1B91988AEA0">
childhood, compared with what &s;he would be capable of arriving at, had &s;he, as &s;he ought to have, the legi&s;lative powers in her own hands. England, is at this time, proudly coveting what would do her no good, were &s;he to accompli&s;h it; and the continent he&s;itating on a matter, which will be her final ruin if neglected. It is the commerce, and not the conque&s;t of America, by which England is to be benefited, and that would in a great mea&s;ure continue, were the countries as independant of each other as France and Spain; becau&s;e in many articles, neither can go to a better market But it is the independance of this country on Britain or any other, which is now the main and only object worthy of contention, and which, like all other truths di&s;covered by nece&s;&s;ity, will ap|pear clearer and &s;tronger every day.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. Becau&s;e it will come to that one time or other.</P>
<P>Secondly. Becau&s;e the longer it is delayed, the harder, it will be to accompli&s;h.</P>
<P>I have frequently amu&s;ed my&s;elf both in public and private companies, with &s;ilently remarking the &s;pecious errors of tho&s;e who &s;peak without reflecting. And among the many which I have heard, the follow|ing &s;eems the mo&s;t general, viz. that had this rupture happened forty or fifty years hence, in&s;tead of <HI>now,</HI> the Continent would have been more able to have &s;haken off the dependance. To which I reply, that our military ability <HI>at this time,</HI> ari&s;es from the experience gained in the la&s;t war, and which in forty or fifty years time, would have been totally extinct. The Continent would not, by that time, have had a General, or even a military officer left; and we, or tho&s;e who may &s;ucceed us, would have been as ignorant of martial matters as the ancient Indians: And this &s;ingle po&s;i|tion, clo&s;ely attended to, will unan&s;werably prove,
<PB N="31" REF="043053_0031_101CB1BCA0F604D0">
that the pre&s;ent time is preferable to all others: The argument turns thus: At the conclu&s;ion of the la&s;t war, we had experience, but wanted numbers; and forty or fifty years hence, we &s;hould have numbers, without experience; wherefore, the proper point of time, mu&s;t be &s;ome particular point between the two extremes, in which a &s;ufficiency of the former remains, and a proper encrea&s;e of the latter is obtained: And that point of time is the pre&s;ent time.</P>
<P>The reader will pardon this digre&s;&s;ion, as it does not properly come under the head I fir&s;t &s;et out with, and to which I again return by the following po&s;i|tion, viz.</P>
<P>Should affairs be patched up with Britain, and &s;he to remain the governing and &s;overeign power of America, (which as matters are now circum&s;tanced, is giving up the point entirely) we &s;hall deprive our|&s;elves of the very means of &s;inking the debt we have, or may contract. The value of the back lands, which &s;ome of the provinces are clande&s;tinely deprived of, by the unju&s;t extention of the limits of Canada, va|lued only at five pounds &s;terling per hundred acres, amount to upwards of twenty five millions, Penn&s;yl|vania currency; and the quit-rents at one penny &s;terling per acre, to two millions yearly.</P>
<P>It is by the &s;ale of tho&s;e lands, that the debt may be &s;unk, without burthen to any, and the quit-rent re&s;erved thereon, will always le&s;&s;en, and in time will wholly &s;upport the yearly expence of government. It matters not now long the debt is in paying, &s;o that the lands when &s;old, be applied to the di&s;charge of it, and for the execution of which, the Congre&s;s for the time being, will be the continental tru&s;tees.</P>
<P>I proceed now to the &s;econd head, viz. Which is the ea&s;ie&s;t and mo&s;t practicable plan, <HI>Reconciliation or Independance;</HI> with &s;ome occa&s;ional remarks.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="043053_0032_101CB1C1F3C789F8">
He who takes nature for his guide, is not ea&s;ily beaten out of his argument, and on that ground, I an&s;wer <HI>generally, That</HI> independance <HI>being a</HI> &s;ingle &s;imple line, <HI>contained within our&s;elves; and reconciliation, a matter exceedingly, perplexed and complicated, and in which, a treacherous capricious court is to interfere, gives the an&s;wer without a doubt.</HI></P>
<P>The pre&s;ent &s;tate of America is truly alarming to every man who is capable of reflection. Without law, without government, without any other mode of power than what is founded on, and granted by courte&s;y. Held together by an unexampled concur|rence of &s;entiment, which, is neverthele&s;s &s;ubject to change, and which, every &s;ecret enemy is endeavour|ing to di&s;&s;olve. Our pre&s;ent condition, is, Legi&s;lation without law; wi&s;dom without a plan; a con&s;titution without a name; and, what is &s;trangely a&s;toni&s;hing, perfect Independance contending for dependance. The in&s;tance is without a precedent; the ca&s;e never exi&s;ted before; and who can tell what may be the event? The property of no man is &s;ecure in the pre&s;ent un|braced &s;y&s;tem of things. The mind of the multitude is left at random, and &s;eeing no fixed object before them, they pur&s;ue &s;uch as fancy or opinion &s;tarts. Nothing is criminal; there is no &s;uch thing as trea&s;on; wherefore, every one thinks him&s;elf at liberty to act as he plea&s;es. The Tories would not have dared to a&s;&s;emble offen&s;ively had they known that their lives, by that act, were forfeited to the laws of the &s;tate. A line of di&s;tinction &s;hould be drawn, between Engli&s;h &s;oldiers taken in battle, and inhabitants of America taken in arms. The fir&s;t are pri&s;oners, but the latter traitors. The one forfeits his liberty, the other his head.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding our wi&s;dom, there is a vi&s;ible fee|blene&s;s in &s;ome of our proceedings, which gives en|couragement
<PB N="33" REF="043053_0033_101CB1C72966E468">
to diffentions. The Continental Belt is too loo&s;ely buckled. And if &s;omething is not done in time, it will be too late to do any thing, and we &s;hall fall into a &s;tate, in which, neither <HI>Reconciliation</HI> nor <HI>Independance</HI> will be practicable. The king and his worthle&s;s adherents are got at the old game of dividing the Continent, and there are not wanting a|mong us, Printers, who will be bu&s;y in &s;preading &s;pecious fal&s;ehoods. The artful and hypocritical letter, which appeared a few months ago, in two of the New-York papers, and likewi&s;e in two others, is an evidence, that there are men who want either judge|ment or hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y getting into holes and corners, and talking of reconciliation: But do &s;uch men &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;i|der, how difficult the talk is, and how dangerous it may prove, &s;hould the Continent divide thereon. Do they take within their view, all the various orders of men, who&s;e &s;ituation and circum&s;tances, as well as their own, are to be con&s;idered therein. Do they put them&s;elves in the place of the &s;ufferer, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>already</HI> gone, and of the &s;oldier, who hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> for the defence of his country. If their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> moderation be &s;uited to their own private <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>only,</HI> regardle&s;s of others, the event will convince them, that "they are reckoning without their ho&s;t."</P>
<P>Put us, &s;ay &s;ome, upon the footing we were on in &s;ixty-three: To which I an&s;wer, the reque&s;t is not <HI>now</HI> in the power of Britain to comply with, neither will &s;he propo&s;e it; but it were, and even &s;hould be granted, I a&s;k, as a rea&s;onable que&s;tion. By what means is &s;uch a corrupt and faith &s;o court to be kept to its engagements? Another parliament, nay, even the pre&s;ent may hereafter repeat the obligation, on the pretence of its being violently obtained, or unwi&s;ely granted; and in that ca&s;e, Where is our redre&s;s?&mdash;
<PB N="34" REF="043053_0034_101CB1C8B7B65C10">
No going to law with nations; cannon are the barri|&s;ters of crowns; and the &s;word, not of ju&s;tice, but of war, decides the &s;uit. To be on the footing of &s;ixty-three, it is not &s;ufficient, that the laws only be put on the &s;ame &s;tate, but that our circum&s;tances, likewi&s;e be put on the &s;ame &s;tate; our burnt and de&s;troyed towns repaired or built up, our private lo&s;&s;es made good, our public debts (contracted for defence) di&s;charged, otherwi&s;e, we &s;hall be millions wor&s;e, than we were at that enviable period. Such a reque&s;t, had it been complied with a year ago, would have won the heart and &s;oul of the Continent, but now it is too late. "The Rubicon is pa&s;&s;ed."</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the taking up arms, merely to enforce the repeal of a pecuniary law, &s;eems as unwarrantable by the divine law, and as repugnant to human feelings, as the taking up arms to enforce the obedience there|to. The object, on either &s;ide, doth not ju&s;tify the means; for the lives of men are too valuable, to be ca&s;t away on &s;uch trifles. It is the violence which is done and threatened to our per&s;ons; the de&s;truction of our property by an armed force; the inva&s;ion of our country by fire and &s;word, which con&s;cientiou&s;ly qualifies the u&s;e of arms: And the in&s;tant, in which &s;uch a mode of defence became nece&s;&s;ary, all &s;ubjection to Britain ought to have cea&s;ed; and the independan|cy of America, &s;hould have been con&s;idered, as dating its aera from, and publi&s;hed by, <HI>the fir&s;t musket that was fired again&s;t her.</HI> This line is a line of con&s;i&s;ten|cy; neither drawn by caprice, nor extended by am|bition; but produced by a chain of events, of which the colonies were not the authors.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude the&s;e remarks, with the following timely and well intended hints. We ought to reflect, that there are three different ways, by which an inde|pendancy may hereafter be affected; and that <HI>one</HI> of
<PB N="35" REF="043053_0035_101CB1CA6A4899A8">
tho&s;e <HI>three,</HI> will one day or other, be the fate of Ame|rica, viz. By the legal voice of the people in Con|gre&s;s; by a military power; or by a mob: It may not always happen that our &s;oldiers are citizens, and the multitude a body of rea&s;onable men; vertue, as I have already remarked, is not hereditary, neither is it perpetual. Should an independancy be brought a|bout by the fir&s;t of tho&s;e means, we have every op|portunity and every encouragement before us, to form the noble&s;t pure&s;t con&s;titution on the face of the earth. We have it in our power to begin the world over again. A &s;ituation, &s;imilar to the pre&s;ent, hath not happened &s;ince the days of Noah until now. The birth day of a new world is at hand, and a race of men, perhaps as numerous as all Europe contains, are to receive their portion of freedom from the event of a few months. The reflection is awful and in this point of view, how trifling, how ridiculous, do the little, paltry cavillings, of a few weak or intere&s;ted men appear, when weighed again&s;t the bu&s;ine&s;s of a world.</P>
<P>Should we neglect the pre&s;ent favorable and invit|ing period, and an independance be hereafter effected by other means, we mu&s;t charge the con&s;equence to our&s;elves, or to tho&s;e rather, who&s;e narrow and preju|diced &s;ouls, are habitually oppo&s;ing the mea&s;ure, with|out either inquiring or reflecting. There are rea&s;ons to be given in &s;upport of independance, which men &s;hould rather privately think of, than be publickly told of. We ought not now to be debating whether we &s;hall be independant or not, but, anxious to ac|compli&s;h it on a farm, &s;ecure, and honorable ba&s;is, and unca&s;tly rather that it is not yet began upon. Every day convinces us of its nece&s;&s;ity. Even the To<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters"> (if &s;uch beings yet remain among us) &s;hould, of all men, be the mo&s;t &s;olicitous to promote it; for as the
<PB N="36" REF="043053_0036_101CB1CDF8C5C0A0">
appointment of committees at fir&s;t, protected them from popular rage, &s;o, a wi&s;e and well e&s;tabli&s;hed form of government, will be the only certain means of con|tinuing it &s;ecurely to them. <HI>Wherefore,</HI> if they have not virtue enough to be WHIGS, they ought to have prudence enough to wi&s;h for Independance.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, Independance is the only BOND that can tye and keep us together. We &s;hall then &s;ee our ob|ject, and our ears will be legally &s;hut again&s;t the &s;chemes of an intriguing, as well, as a cruel enemy. We &s;hall then too, be on a proper footing, to treat with Britain; for there is rea&s;on to conclude, that the pride of that court, will be le&s;s hurt by treating with the American &s;tates for terms of peace, than with tho&s;e, whom &s;he denominates, "rebellious &s;ub|jects," for terms of accommodation. It is our delay|ing it that encourages her to hope for conque&s;t, and our backwardne&s;s tends only to prolong the war. As we have, without any good effect therefrom, with|held our trade to obtain a redre&s;s of our grievances, let us now try the alternative, by <HI>independantly</HI> redre&s;|&s;ing them our&s;elves, and then offering to open the trade. The mercantile and rea&s;onable part in Eng|land, will be &s;till with us; becau&s;e, peace with trade, is preferable to war without it. And if this offer be not accepted, other courts may be applied to.</P>
<P>On the&s;e grounds I re&s;t the matter. And as no offer hath yet been made to refute the doctrine contained in the former editions of this pamphlet, it is a negative proof, that either the doctrine cannot be refuted, or, that the party in favour of it are too numerous to be oppo&s;ed. <HI>Wherefore</HI> in&s;tead of gazing at each other with &s;u&s;picious or doubtful curio&s;ity, let each of us hold out to his neighbour the hearty hand of friend&s;hip, and unite in drawing a line, which, like an act of ob|livion &s;hall bury in forgetfulne&s;s every former di&s;&s;en|tion
<PB N="37" REF="043053_0037_101CABB6A3F2B2A0">
Let the names of Whig and Tory be extinct; and let none other be heard among us, than tho&s;e of <HI>a good citizen, an open and re&s;olute friend, and a virtuous &s;upporter of the rights of mankind and of the free and inde|pendant &s;tates of America.</HI></P>

<P>As you have, without a proper authority for &s;o do|ing, put your&s;elves in the place of the whole body of the Quakers, &s;o, the writer of this, in order to be on an equal rank with your&s;elves, is under the nece&s;&s;ity, of putting him&s;elf in the place of all tho&s;e, who, ap|prove the very writings and principles, again&s;t which, your te&s;timony is directed: And he hath cho&s;en this &s;ingular &s;ituation, in order, that you might di&s;cover in him that pre&s;umption of character which you can|not &s;ee in your&s;elves.

When men have departed from the right way, it is no wonder that they &s;tumble and fall. And it is evident from the manner in which ye have managed your te&s;timony, that politics, (as a religious body of men) is not your proper Walk; for however well a|dapted it might appear to you, it is, neverthele&s;s, a a jumble of good and bad put unwi&s;ely together, and the conclu&s;ion drawn therefrom, both unnatural and unju&s;t.</P>
<P>The two fir&s;t pages, (and the whole doth not make four) we give you credit for, and expect the &s;ame ci|vility from you, becau&s;e the love and de&s;ire of peace is not confined to Quakeri&s;m, it is the natural, as well as, the religious wi&s;h of all denominations of men. And on this ground, as men laboring to e&s;tabli&s;h an Independant Con&s;titution of our own, do we exceed all others in our hope, end, and aim. <HI>Our plan is peace forever.</HI> We are tired of contention with Britain, and can &s;ee no real end to it but in a final &s;eparation. We act con&s;i&s;tently, becau&s;e for the &s;ake of introdu|cing an endle&s;s and uninterupted peace, do we bear the evils and burthens of the pre&s;ent day. We are endeavoring, and will &s;teadily continue to endeavour, to &s;eperate and di&s;&s;olve a connection which hath al|ready filled our land with blood; and which, while the name of it remains, will be the fatal cau&s;e of fu|ture mi&s;chiefs to both countries.</P>
<P>We &s;ight neither for revenge nor conque&s;t; nei|ther from pride nor pa&s;&s;ion; we are not in&s;ulting the world with our fleets and armies, nor ravaging the globe for plunder. Beneath the &s;hade of our own vines are we attacked; in our own hou&s;es, and on our own lands, is the violence committed again&s;t us. We view our enemies in the character of Highway|men and Hou&s;e-breakers, and having no defence for our&s;elves in the civil law, are obliged to puni&s;h them

If the bearing arms be &s;inful, the fir&s;t going to war mu&s;t be more &s;o, by all the difference between wilful attack and unavoidable defence.

<P>Alas! it &s;eems by the particular tendency of &s;ome part of your te&s;timony, and other parts of your con|duct, as if, all &s;in was reduced to, and comprehended in, <HI>the act of bearing arms,</HI> and that by the <HI>people only.</HI> Ye appear to us to have mi&s;taken party for con&s;cience; becau&s;e the general tenor of your actions wants uni|formity: And it is exceedingly difficult to us to give credit to many of your pretended &s;cruples; becau&s;e, we &s;ee them made by the &s;ame men, who, in the very in&s;tant that they are exclaiming again&s;t the mammon of this world, are neverthele&s;s hunting after it with a &s;tep as &s;teady as Time, and an appetite as keen as Death.</P>
<P>The quotation which ye have made from Proverbs, in the third page of your te&s;timony, that, <Q>when a man's ways plea&s;e the Lord, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him;</Q> is very unwi&s;ely cho&s;en on your part; becau&s;e, it amounts to a proof, that the king's ways (whom ye are &s;o de&s;irous of &s;up|porting) do <HI>not</HI> plea&s;e the Lord, otherwi&s;e, his reign would be in peace.</P>
<P>I now proceed to the latter part of your te&s;timony and that, for which all the foregoing &s;eems only an introduction, viz.</P>
<P>"It hath ever been our judgment and principle, &s;ince we were called to profe&s;s the light of Chri&s;t Je&s;us, manife&s;ted in our con&s;ciences unto this day, that the &s;etting up and putting down kings and go|vernments,
<PB N="41" REF="043053_0041_101CB1E013DCCEF0">
is God's peculiar prerogative; for cau&s;es be&s;t known to him&s;elf: And that it is not our bu&s;i|ne&s;s to have any hand or contrivance therein; nor to be bu&s;y-bodies above our &s;tation, much le&s;s to plot and contrive the ruin or overturn of any of them, but to pray for the king, and &s;afety of our nation, and good of all men: That we may live a peaceable and quiet life, in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty; <HI>under the goverment which God is plea&s;ed to &s;et over us"</HI>&mdash;If the&s;e are really your principles why do you not abide by them? Why do you not leave that, which ye call God's Work, to be managed by him&s;elf? The&s;e very principles in&s;truct you to wait with patience and hu|mility, for the event of all public mea&s;ures, and to re|ceive that event as the divine will towards you. <HI>Wherefore,</HI> what occa&s;ion is there for your <HI>political te&s;|timony</HI> if you fully believe what it contains? And the very publi&s;hing it proves, that either, ye do not be|lieve what ye profe&s;s, or have not virtue enough to practice what ye believe.</P>
<P>The principles of Quakeri&s;m have a direct tendency to make a man the quiet and inoffen&s;ive &s;ubject of any, and every government which is &s;et over him And if the &s;etting up and putting down of kings and governments is God's peculiar prerogative, he mo&s;t certainly will not be robbed thereof by us; where|fore, the principle it&s;elf leads you to approve of every thing, which ever happened, or may happen to kings as beings his work. Oliver Cromwell thanks you. Charles, then, died not by the hands of man; and &s;hould the pre&s;ent proud Imitator of him, come to the &s;ame untimely end, the writers and publi&s;hers of the te&s;timony, are bound by the doctrine it contains, to applaud the fact. Kings are not taken away by miracles, neither are changes in governments brought about by any other means than &s;uch as are common
<PB N="42" REF="043053_0042_101CB1E374ECFEF8">
and human; and &s;uch as we are now u&s;ing. Even the di&s;per&s;ion of the Jews, though foretold by our Saviour, was effected by arms. Wherefore, as ye re|fu&s;e to be the means on one &s;ide, ye ought not to be meddlers on the other; but to wait the i&s;&s;ue in &s;i|lence? and unle&s;s ye can produce divine authority, to prove, that the Almighty who hath created and placed this new world at the greate&s;t di&s;tance it could po&s;&s;ibly &s;tand, ea&s;t and we&s;t, from every part of the old, doth, neverthele&s;s, di&s;approve of its being inde|pendant of the corrupt and abandoned court of Bri|tain, unle&s;s I &s;ay, ye can &s;hew this, how can ye on the ground of your principles, ju&s;tify the exciting and &s;tirring up the people <Q>firmly to unite in the <HI>ab|horrence</HI> of all &s;uch <HI>writings,</HI> and <HI>mea&s;ures,</HI> as evi|dence a de&s;ire and de&s;ign to break off the <HI>happy</HI> connexion we have hitherto enjoyed, with the kingdom of Great-Britain, and our ju&s;t and nece&s;|&s;ary &s;ubordination to the king, and tho&s;e who are lawfully placed in authority under him.</Q> What a &s;lap of the face is here! The men, who in the very paragragh before, have quietly and pa&s;&s;ively re&s;igned up the ordering, altering, and di&s;po&s;al of kings and governments, into the hands of God, are now recal|ling their principles, and putting in for a &s;hare of the bu&s;ine&s;s. Is it po&s;&s;ible, that the conclu&s;ion, which is here ju&s;tly quoted, can any ways follow from the doctrine laid down? The incon&s;i&s;tency is too glaring not to be &s;een; the ab&s;urdity too great not to be laughed at; and &s;uch as could only have been made by tho&s;e, whole under&s;tandings were darkened by the narrow and crabbed &s;pirit of a de&s;pairing politi|cal party; for ye are not to be con&s;idered as the whole body of the Quakers, but only as a factional and fractional part thereof.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="043053_0043_101CB1E6AA6EEA40">
Here ends the examination of your te&s;timony; (which, I call upon no man to abhor, as ye have done, but only to read and judge of fairly;) to which I &s;ub|join the following remark; <Q>That the &s;etting up and putting down of kings,</Q> mo&s;t certainly mean, the making him a king, who is yet not &s;o, and the ma|king him no king who is already one. And pray what hath this to do in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e? We neither mean to <HI>&s;et up</HI> nor to <HI>pull down,</HI> neither to <HI>make</HI> nor to <HI>unmake,</HI> but to have nothing to <HI>do</HI> with them. Where|fore, your te&s;timony in whatever light it is viewed &s;erves only to di&s;honor your judgment, and for many other rea&s;ons had better have been let alone than publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Becau&s;e it tends to the decrea&s;e and reproach of all religion whatever, and is of the utmo&s;t danger to &s;ociety, to make it a party in political di&s;putes.</P>
<P>Secondly, Becau&s;e it exhibits a body of men, num|bers of whom di&s;avow the publi&s;hing political te&s;timo|nies, as being concerned therein and approvers thereof.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Becau&s;e it hath a tendency to undo that Continental harmony and friend&s;hip which your&s;elves by your late liberal and charatable donations hath lent a hand to e&s;tabli&s;h; and the pre&s;ervation of which, is of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to us all.</P>
<P>And here without anger or re&s;entment I bid you farewel. Sincerely wi&s;hing, that as men and chri&s;ti|ans, ye may always fully and uninterruptedly enjoy every civil and religious right; and be, in your turn, the means of &s;ecuring it to others; but that the ex|ample which ye have unwi&s;ely &s;et, of mingling religi|on with politics, <HI>may be di&s;avowed and reprobated by e|very inhabitant of America.</HI></P>
