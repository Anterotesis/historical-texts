</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT was a Great CASE, which the Parents to a Son of Great Hope, once put unto a Me&s;&s;enger of Heaven; Judg. 13.12. <HI>How &s;hall we order the Child, and what &s;hall we do unto him?</HI> The <HI>Education of our Chil|dren</HI> is a point of inexpre&s;&s;ible Con&s;equence; of un|parallelled Importance.

<P><PB N="2" REF="001361_0007_0FB29238F487F7B0">I will an&s;wer in one word; Let the <HI>Children</HI> have &s;uch an <HI>Education</HI> as <HI>Timothy</HI> had. We have before us a De&s;crip|tion of that <HI>Education;</HI> and a Direction to give you this.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD><HI>DOCTRINE.</HI> That Saving Wi&s;dom is to be fetch'd from the Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures; and the Early Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures, is the way to be Betimes made Wi&s;e unto Salva|tion.</HEAD>
<P>That we may more intelligibly pro&s;ecute this <HI>Doctrine,</HI> we will fir&s;t a little Entertain our &s;elves with the Hi&s;tory of, <HI>A Child made Wi&s;e unto Salvation, by the Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures.</HI> A TIMOTHY, and the <HI>Education</HI> of a Lovely <HI>Timothy,</HI> &s;hall be fir&s;t a little &s;et before us.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Timothy</HI> is now Addre&s;s'd by the Aged Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> at this time a Pri&s;oner at <HI>Rome;</HI> with an Epi&s;tle written by him, a little before his Martyrdom: An Epi&s;tle, which <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom</HI> ingeniou&s;ly calls, <HI>Our Apo&s;tles La&s;t Will and Te&s;ta|ment.</HI> In this Epi&s;tle, Our Apo&s;tle Exhorts his Excellent and Beloved <HI>Son Timothy;</HI> [a <HI>Son,</HI> he might well call him, having &s;o many ways both <HI>Adopted</HI> him, and In&s;tructed him:] He Exhorts him to Stedfa&s;tne&s;s in the Faith and Work of His Glorious LORD. One Argument, with which he inculcates this Exhortation, is his <HI>Education.</HI> For one Educated in the <HI>Way of Truth,</HI> and in the <HI>Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures,</HI> to for&s;ake the <HI>Way of God,</HI> is wor&s;e than for another to do &s;o. From &s;uch as are <HI>Well</HI> Educated, there are <HI>Better Things</HI> expected than from others. Con&s;ider this, O Apo&s;tates from a <HI>New-Engli&s;h</HI> Education; <HI>Con&s;ider</HI> it, you that <HI>Forget</HI> how you have been <HI>Educated,</HI> le&s;t the <HI>Wrath</HI> of Heaven <HI>tear you to pieces, and there who none to deliver you.</HI> When the Son and Grand&s;on perhaps, of tho&s;e that have been Faithful Servants of God &s;hall fir&s;t Go off to an Ob|&s;ervable Degree of Bigotry, for the <HI>Super&s;tition,</HI> again&s;t which his Progenitors had born glorious <HI>Te&s;timonies;</HI> and then go on to a <HI>Malignity</HI> again&s;t the People of God among which, he has had his <HI>Education;</HI> and publi&s;h his <HI>Malignity</HI> with abhorred &s;trains of <HI>Profane&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Athei&s;m:</HI> 'Tis not enough

to call upon &s;uch an one, with the old Jewi&s;h Rebuke, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Thou Vinegar, the Son of Good Wine!</HI> It mu&s;t be &s;aid, he is a <HI>dreadful Spectacle.</HI> He has made him&s;elf &s;o; And one may tremble to think, What the Holy God will e'er long make of him. <HI>Friend,</HI> When the <HI>Goodne&s;s</HI> of a Young man, like the <HI>Morning Cloud,</HI> and the <HI>Early Dew,</HI> &s;oon <HI>pa&s;&s;es away,</HI> the Ju&s;tice of God is not long upon the Deliberation, <HI>What &s;hall I do unto thee! What &s;hall I do unto thee!</HI></P>
<P>Our <HI>Timothy</HI> was very happy in his <HI>Education.</HI> It may be Edifying for us, a little to Reflect on the <HI>Occa&s;ion</HI> of this Education, and the <HI>Influence</HI> of it.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Timothy</HI> had a Godly <HI>Mother,</HI> and a Godly <HI>Grandmo|ther.</HI> He might &s;uck in Knowledge and Goodne&s;s <HI>with his Mothers Milk.</HI> He might be Taught the Right Wayes of the Lord, while his Grandmother had him by his Leading-&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ings. Both of them were <HI>Jews;</HI> And probably they were Early Converts to <HI>Chri&s;tianity.</HI> His Father was a <HI>Gentile!</HI> Whether a <HI>Pro&s;elyte</HI> or no, we are not informed. But he al|&s;o was Converted unto <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> at the &s;ame time with his de&s;irable Con&s;ort. They had before this, betimes begun to give their little Son, the <HI>Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures.</HI> An Early Tincture of <HI>Scriptural Piety</HI> thus took the Mind of the <HI>Child.</HI> But when the Parents were brought home to the Ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, they wholly committed, as it &s;eems, their Little <HI>Son,</HI> unto the Care of that Venerable Mini&s;ter, who had been their <HI>Spiritual Father.</HI> Having them&s;elves got good by a Mini&s;ter of God, they mu&s;t have their Child, in the way of getting the &s;ame Good. They begg'd <HI>Paul,</HI> to take the Tuition of him; Oh! happy Child, in the Hands of &s;uch a Tutor!</P>
<P>Well; And what was the <HI>Effect</HI> of this <HI>Education?</HI> Our <HI>Timothy</HI> did him&s;elf prove a Chri&s;tian of the <HI>Fir&s;t Race;</HI> yea, and an admirable <HI>Mini&s;ter,</HI> His Labours in the <HI>Harve&s;t</HI> of the Lord, were Extraordinary; Every one wondred, how any one man, could ever <HI>Labour &s;o abundantly.</HI> He was of a <HI>Feeble</HI> Con&s;titution; and of &s;uch an Ab&s;temious <HI>Tempe|rance,</HI> that he was even blamed for it; but one of an <HI>Active Soul,</HI> One of a <HI>Flaming Zeal.</HI> The Great <HI>Paul</HI> could give this Te&s;timony of him, That he did not know another man in the world, who &s;o <HI>Naturally</HI> took to the doing of Good;

<P>One main &s;troke in Religion is, FAITH towards our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. <HI>Faith</HI> is in the Bible often called by the Name of, <HI>Wi&s;dom.</HI> 'Tis mo&s;t Ju&s;tly called &s;o.

<P>Another main &s;troke in Religion is, REPENTANCE towards God. <HI>Repentance</HI> is a <HI>Re&s;ipi&s;cence,</HI> of <HI>Growing Wi&s;e</HI> again.

<P>There is no man, but what will own, 'Tis the <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> of every man, to <HI>Save his own Soul:</HI> For, <HI>What is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, and lo&s;e his own Soul?</HI> Now the I&s;&s;ue of conformity to the <HI>Rules of Religion,</HI> will be the <HI>Salvation of the Soul.</HI> We read, Heb. 5.9.

Eph. 1.13. <HI>It is the Go&s;pel of your Salvation.</HI> If we lack the Knowledge of this <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> we &s;hall mi&s;s of <HI>Salvation,</HI> and be <HI>De&s;troy'd for the lack of Knowledge.</HI> If we do not know the Go&s;pel, we &s;hall be a <HI>people of no under&s;tanding;</HI> Of &s;uch a people, how terribly it Thunders! <HI>He that made them will not have mercy on them; He that formed them, will &s;how them no Favour.</HI> What is all the Learning in the World, with|out the <HI>Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures!</HI> There were (they &s;ay) two hundred thou&s;and Books, in the Library which <HI>Ptolomy</HI> Erected at <HI>Alexandria;</HI> but it was the Addition of the <HI>Hoi Scriptures,</HI> which made it a <HI>truly Learned Library.</HI> And whatever we have Learnt from all our <HI>Books,</HI> 'tis the <HI>Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures,</HI> that will bring us to the True&s;t, and indeed the only <HI>Learning.</HI> A Dying <HI>Grotius,</HI> or <HI>Selden</HI> will tell you &s;o?</P>
<P>But what &s;ort of <HI>Knowledge</HI> is requi&s;ite?</P>
<P>Be &s;ure, A <HI>Doctrinal Knowledge</HI> of the <HI>Holy Scriptures</HI> is requi&s;ite, that we may be <HI>VVi&s;e unto Salvation.</HI> We read, 2 Cor. 4.3. <HI>If our Go&s;pel be hid, it is hid unto them that be Lo&s;t.</HI> We mu&s;t know <HI>Doctrinally</HI> the main Things that are communicated unto us in the <HI>Holy Scriptures.</HI> The <HI>Creati|on</HI> of Man by GOD; The <HI>Confu&s;ion</HI> of Man by SIN; The <HI>Redemption</HI> of Man by CHRIST.

<P>But then, a <HI>Practical Knowledge</HI> of the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> is al&s;o requi&s;ite, We <HI>know</HI> to little purpo&s;e, except we <HI>Do</HI> according to what we <HI>know.</HI> We read, Joh. 13.17. <HI>Since ye know the&s;e things, Happy are ye, if you do them.

<P N="3">III. The Inference from hence is; That the EARLY KNOWLEDGE of the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> is the way to be BETIMES <HI>made wi&s;e unto Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>And now there is a Twofold APPLICATION to be made of this Ob&s;ervation. We will di&s;cour&s;e on this Ob|&s;ervation, by Applying it unto two &s;orts of per&s;ons.</P>
<P N="1">I. It is the Intere&s;t of all TEACHERS to <HI>Begin Betimes,</HI> in Teaching of <HI>Children,</HI> the <HI>Early Knowledge</HI> of the HOLY SCRIPTURES, that &s;o they may be WISE UNTO SAL|VATION. It is to <HI>You,</HI> O TEACHERS; unto You fir&s;t, there mu&s;t now come the Word of the Lord. It mu&s;t come, with an An&s;wer to Divers <HI>Enquiries.</HI></P>
<P>We will, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Enquire, and Declare, WHEN &s;hould we <HI>Begin</HI> to <HI>Teach our Children,</HI> the <HI>Knowledge of the Holy Scrip|tures?</HI></P>
<P>BETIMES! BETIMES! Let the Children have the <HI>Early Knowledge</HI> of the <HI>Holy Scriptures.</HI> That Princely Preacher, the Prince of <HI>Anbalt,</HI> would &s;ay; <HI>The Holy Scrip|tures, what are they but the &s;wadling Clothes of the Holy Child Je&s;us?</HI> HE is to be found in every Chapter. I will then &s;ay, Let us Teach our Children the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> as &s;oon as we can after they come out of their <HI>Swadling Cloaths.</HI> This is the Direction of the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> Deut. 6.7. <HI>Thou &s;hall
<PB N="8" REF="001361_0013_0FB2C65603E519D0">
teach them diligently unto thy Children.</HI> And Eph. 6.4. <HI>Your Children, Bring them up in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord.</HI> But the HOLY SCRIPTURES have not Expre&s;ly &s;aid, <HI>How Early,</HI> we &s;hall <HI>Begin to Teach</HI> our Children, the KNOWLEDGE of them. However, we may ea&s;ily De|termine it.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t; <HI>How Early</HI> do the Children begin to be <HI>capable</HI> of <HI>Knowing</HI> &amp; <HI>Minding</HI> what is in the HOLY SCRIPTURES? Mo&s;t certainly we &s;hould <HI>Begin as &s;oon as we can. As &s;oon</HI> as the Children can <HI>know, &s;o &s;oon</HI> &s;hould we <HI>Teach</HI> them, what they &s;hould <HI>know. So much</HI> there is to be Learnt, it is pity any <HI>Time</HI> &s;hould be Lo&s;t. No doubt, they Began &s;o &s;oon with <HI>Solomon;</HI> El&s;e he would not have &s;aid, Prov. 4.3, 4. <HI>I was any Fathers Son, a Tender and only one in the &s;ight of my Mother,</HI> Then <HI>he Taught me.</HI></P>
<P>Again; <HI>How Early</HI> do the Children begin to Know <HI>Other Matters?</HI> Why &s;hould we not begin to Teach them &s;ome|thing from the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> that may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> them. <HI>[Lae|ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">it hic Infans,] as Early</HI> as we Teach them things <HI>Le&s;s</HI> Worthy, <HI>Le&s;s</HI> U&s;eful! Can we Teach them, what they have to <HI>us?</HI> Methinks, we may then Teach them, what they owe to the LORD, who made both us and Them? Their Little Souls are precious <HI>Cabinets.</HI> Why &s;hould not the <HI>Be&s;t</HI> Things be <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> put into them? We are &s;o called upon; Matth. 6.31. <HI>Seek fir&s;t the Kingdom of God.</HI> Even &s;o, with the <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Let them Learn the Things that Concern the <HI>Kingdom of God.</HI></P>
<P>Once more; <HI>How Early</HI> do the Children Begin to <HI>Know,</HI> and to <HI>Do,</HI> what may be <HI>Hurtful</HI> to them? 'Tis very <HI>Early,</HI> that they Learn the Things <HI>Condemned</HI> in the HOLY SCRIPTURES. Why &s;hould they not as EARLY Learn the HOLY SCRIPTURES, which do condemn tho&s;e per|nicious and provoking Evils? Why &s;hould they not <HI>know</HI> the <HI>Precepts</HI> of God, as EARLY as they know how to <HI>Break</HI> the Precepts? Why &s;hould they not be Taught, that they mu&s;t Fear God, and Love Chri&s;t, and Hate Sin, as EARLY as they can Learn to <HI>Sin?</HI> E&s;pecially &s;ince this would be the way to <HI>pre&s;erve</HI> them from <HI>Sin.</HI> A Child no &s;ooner begins to do any thing <HI>Rational,</HI> but <HI>Satan</HI> begins to &s;how it, how to do &s;omething that is <HI>Criminal.</HI> Me|thinks;

I &s;ee the Image of it; Rev. 12.4. <HI>The Dragon &s;tood to devour the Child as &s;oon as it was born,</HI> Then &s;ay I; It becomes us to be <HI>Aforehand</HI> with the <HI>Dragon,</HI> if it be po&s;&s;i|ble: To &s;tand Ready with the <HI>Knowledge of the Holy Scrip|tures,</HI> to re&s;cue the <HI>Children</HI> from the Venomous De&s;igns of the <HI>Dragon</HI> upon them.</P>
<P>There is a plau&s;ible Objection, again&s;t this <HI>Early E&s;&s;ay,</HI> to give our <HI>Children</HI> the <HI>Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures.</HI></P>
<P>Will not this be to make the Children, <HI>Take the Name of the Lord in vain?</HI> Would it not be more <HI>Di&s;cretion,</HI> to &s;tay till the <HI>Children</HI> are them&s;elves come to &s;ome <HI>Years of Di&s;|cretion?</HI></P>
<P>It is Ea&s;ily An&s;wered. Will you never <HI>Teach</HI> the Chil|dren, till you &s;ee them have the <HI>Grace,</HI> that will keep them from <HI>Taking the Name of the Lord in vain?</HI> Rather <HI>Teach</HI> them, to <HI>Keep</HI> them from it.

<P>We will, <HI>Secondly,</HI> Enquire, and Declare, WHAT is that <HI>Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures,</HI> which we are to <HI>Teach our Children?</HI></P>
<P>Truly, AS MUCH as ever WE CAN help them to; <HI>All</HI> the <HI>Knowledge,</HI> that they can Take in, &s;till as we find them <HI>Able</HI> to Take it in. More particularly&punc;</P>
