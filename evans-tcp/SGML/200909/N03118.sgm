BUT the expre&s;&s;ion may more particularly point at the&s;e two things,
<LIST>
<ITEM>(1) That the divine power accompany'd their mi|ni&s;trations, and confirm'd them in the faith that heard it, and the gracious a&s;&s;i&s;tances vouch&s;afed to them, confirm'd them in the expectation of &s;ucce&s;s. And, then</ITEM>

</LIST></P>
<P>WE may hence learn that where Mini&s;ters are regularly call'd to, and faithfully di&s;charge their duty, their labours are com|monly attended with more or le&s;s of &s;oone&s;s, either &s;ooner, or later, for Conver&s;ion and Edification. They have the promi&s;e of Chri&s;t's gracious pre&s;ence with them, and if they are faith|full, they &s;hall have the pre&s;ence of his power to &s;trengthe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> them, and of his ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirit to &s;ucceed them.</P>
<P>THOUGH &s;ometimes they may not have any great vi&s;ible &s;uc|ce&s;s at pre&s;ent,; yet it may comfort &s;uch, that there may be good done by their mini&s;try notwith&s;tanding, and if they done reap the fruit of the &s;eed they &s;ow, they who come after them may But if it &s;hould be &s;o, that neither they, nor their people reap fruit, their mini&s;try &s;hall not be in vain with reference to <HI>them|&s;elves;</HI> for they &s;hall be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, though <HI>I&s;rael</HI> be not gathered.</P>
<P>IN the 2d <HI>v.</HI> the Apo&s;tle tells them of the great difficulties which he encounter'd at his fir&s;t coming among them to preach the Go&s;pel, but yet the&s;e did not at all di&s;courage him from preaching the Go&s;pel with con&s;tancy and re&s;olution. He was notwith&s;tanding <HI>bold in God to &s;peak unto them the Go&s;pel of God.</HI> He was in&s;pir'd with an holy boldne&s;s, and went on couragiou&s;ly in his work, notwith&s;tanding any oppo&s;ition that was made again&s;t him, or ill u&s;age he met withall, from any of the&s;e to whom he was &s;ent. It was a zealous boldne&s;s in the cau&s;e of GOD, and prov'd convincing unto many. It is one nece&s;&s;ary and commendable qualification in the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, in order to the making their mini&s;try &s;ucce&s;sful, that a wi&s;e, hum|ble, zealous and convincing boldne&s;s be found with them in their delivering the truths of GOD unto their People. <HI>We were</HI> (&s;ays the Apo&s;tle) <HI>bold in our God, to &s;peak unto you the go&s;pel of God.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="003764_0005_1002584B5CA89028">
IN my <HI>Text,</HI> and the ver&s;e immediately preceding it, he tells as &s;omething of the manner of his preaching, that it was with <HI>great &s;implicity and godly &s;incerity; for our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleane&s;s, nor in guile; but as we were allowed of God to be put in tru&s;t with the Go&s;pel, even &s;o we &s;peak, not as plea&s;ing men, but God which tvieth our hearts.</HI> We may here Note, that the Apo&s;tle calls his preaching an <HI>Exhortation;</HI> doubtle&s;o becau&s;e a great part of his preaching was (as ours ought to be) applicarory and exhortatory, earne&s;tly and affectionately excit|ing the hearers to cleave unto the truths, whether doctrinal or practical, delivered to them.</P>
<P>HE declares to them, that it was the <HI>&s;incere</HI> and <HI>uncorrupted Go&s;pel</HI> that he preach'd, and ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orted them to believe and obey. His de&s;ign was not to &s;et up a &s;action, to draw men over to a party, but to promote pure Religion, and undefied before GOD and the Father. The Go&s;pel he preach'd, was <HI>without deceit;</HI> it was not of en&s;naring and &s;educing error, not &s;uted to the corrupt opinions and wicked inclinations of Men, Nor was it of <HI>Uncleano&s;s;</HI> his Go&s;pel was pure and holy, worthy of its holy Author, tending to di&s;courage all manner of imperity: Nothing that he either preach'd or practis'd, did countenance or encour|age men in the gratification of their lu&s;ts, as did the erroneous preaching of the fal&s;e Apo&s;tles. And as the matter of his preaching was Pure, &s;o the manner of his &s;peaking was without <HI>guile,</HI> i e. he did not &s;eek him&s;elf under a pretence of acting for GOD and his glory, nor propound his own worldly advanarge as his ultimate end. He had not &s;ini&s;ters aims, but was in reality what he &s;eem'd to be. The Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t &s;hould not only preach the pure word of GOD, but preach is purely, in &s;implicity of heart, and with a &s;ingle eye at the glory of GOD, without looking at, or having any regard to ba&s;e &s;ini&s;ter ends, or by|re&s;pects.</P>
<P>HE would a&s;&s;ure them, that his main de&s;ign was to approve him&s;elf to <HI>GOD,</HI> that he might have the divine approbation; not &s;o much, or at all, regarding to <HI>plea&s;e Men,</HI> but only in &s;ubordination to GOD. And in the words read, he gives us the rea&s;ons or motives inducing him to it. <HI>(Fir&s;t)</HI> He was <HI>put in tru&s;t with the Go&s;pel, allowed of God to be &s;o.</HI> GOD f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed him for this high and honorable tru&s;t, and improv'd him therein; and he looked upon both as a favour and honour done him by the great GOD. The other motive was the con&s;ideration of GOD's emni&s;cient and all-&s;eeing eye upon him, as well knowing <HI>that the heart-&s;earching</HI> GOD was a witne&s;s both of his Doctrine and Conver&s;ition acquained with his aims and ends, and <HI>there|fore</HI> he &s;o preach'd <HI>not as plea&s;ing men, but God.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="003764_0006_1002584DCE3F1458">
AND what is there that can, or &s;hould more powerfully excite the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, to the faithful di&s;charge of their duty, than the con&s;ideration of the honour and weight of the great tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them, and the eye of an heart-&s;earching GOD continually upon them!</P>
<P>HE goes on in the two next ver&s;es, to produce the evidences of his &s;incerity; the <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> is, that he did not u&s;e <HI>flattering words,</HI> to gratify the lu&s;ts and humours of men, to gain their favour or good opinion of him nor did he flatter them in their &s;ins. Flattery in any, is very odious; but more e&s;pecially is it &s;o in the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t. They &s;hould be plain-he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed and faithful in their dealings with men, becau&s;e flattery about things of a &s;piritual nature is mo&s;t pernicious and fatal. <HI>Secondly,</HI> He did not <HI>u&s;e a Cloak of Covetou&s;ne&s;s;</HI> he had no covetous di&s;ign in his Mini&s;try; he did not propo&s;e to gain any outward or worldly advantage to him&s;elf. He &s;olemnly appeals to GOD, who &s;earches the heart, as a witne&s;s of the truth of this. He al&s;o declares, how free he was from all o&s;tentation and <HI>vain|glory:</HI> He did not &s;eek or de&s;ire applau&s;e from men, nor indeed &s;o much as due re&s;pect in a fitting maintenance from them, tho' he does at the &s;ame time a&s;&s;ure them, he did therein remit of his <HI>Right,</HI> &s;eeing as an <HI>Apo&s;tle of Chri&s;t,</HI> he might be <HI>burthen-&s;ome,</HI> i. e. chargeable to them, by exacting a fit and honourable Support from them, which &s;ome might be too ready to think, would be too great a burden for them to bear. We may from hence Note, that tho' the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, may and &s;hould have a due re&s;pect to their own honour and reputation, yet eagerly to &s;eek after re&s;pect and e&s;teem, does &s;avour too much of vanity and vain glory. We may al&s;o learn, that though the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel have an undoubted fight to an honour|able Support, yet it may be a point of prudence in them to re|mit that right, for &s;ome &s;pecial rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>THE Apo&s;tle proceeds in our Context, to give an account of his humble, holy, meek, courteous and affable behaviour among them, by all expre&s;&s;ing his render Love and Affection to them, in which he has &s;et an example for all Chri&s;ts Mini&s;ters to follow.</P>
<P>HAVING thus open'd and paraphras'd upon the <HI>Text,</HI> and <HI>Context,</HI> I come to the DOCTRINE which I de&s;ign for our pre|&s;ent In&s;truction and Improvement, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

In many other ways they may be &s;erviceable to you; &s;urely then, you &s;hould be very thankful to GOD, that your Eves &s;ee teachers, to whom you can with an humble freedom have Acce&s;s, and make known your fears and de&s;ires, when and as frequently as you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>SUCH conde&s;cen&s;ions of the grace of GOD, &s;hould be very thankfully acknowledged by us; that GOD &s;hould &s;end to us &s;ome of our brethren to preach repentance and remi&s;&s;ion of Sins, in the name of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and by them offer &s;alvari. on to us on &s;uch rea&s;onable Terms, and by them &s;o familiarly urge us to a complvance with them. Glory and prai&s;e to GOD in the highe&s;t &s;hould be a&s;cribed, for &s;uch good will towards Men.</P>
<P>USE II. WE may from what has been &s;aid infer <HI>the honour and regard there is due to Chri&s;t's Mini&s;ters.</HI></P>
<P>THEY are worthy of <HI>double honour,</HI> as they repre&s;ent the glo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">us and <HI>incarnate</HI> Son of GOD. From him they receive their me&s;&s;ages, their commi&s;&s;ion and in&s;tructions, They are his Repeaties, act under him as their king and ma&s;ter. They ought certainly then, to have &s;uitable honours and regards paid to them.</P>
<P>THE word of GOD enjoins it, that &s;uch be honourably &s;ap|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ed, and that they be highly e&s;&s;een'd, lov'd and obey'd, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> they watch for your Soul, as tho&s;e that mo&s;t give an Ac|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> ur, that they way do it with &s;ay and not with One&s;.</P>

<P>USE III. <HI>THE &s;in and danger of abu&s;ing the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Do they &s;peak to us in the Name of GOD, by his Authority? Do they repre&s;ent the head of the Church, the ble&s;&s;ed GOD incarnate and inthron'd in our Je&s;us? Mu&s;t it not then be very &s;inful and dangerous to abu&s;e them!</P>
<P>LET me warn all who hear me, to beware of this. Surely your Mini&s;ters have Work and Bu&s;ine&s;s enough, lying upon their hearts and hands; you need not add more. And know it, their Lord and Ma&s;ter, will tenderly and highly re&s;ent any indignities offered to his Emba&s;&s;adors. Abu&s;e of Emba&s;&s;adors, &s;ent by Earthly Kings, has ever by the Law of Nations been highly re&s;ented; we read al&s;o in Scripture of its being &s;o. Let us then be ever cautious and afraid of abu&s;ing or injuring the Lord's Mini&s;ters. Let us be always di&s;po&s;ed to cover their infirmities, and to make the mo&s;t charitable con&s;truction of any thing &s;aid or done by them, that &s;ome may be di&s;pos'd to improve to their prejudice; and be always cautious how we report what we hear concerning them, which it may be is altogether groundle&s;s. Let us be very careful how we treat the Emba&s;&s;adors of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Again, USE IV. <HI>WITH what &s;olemnity and reverence &s;hould we attend to their In&s;tructions.</HI> If they come to us in Chri&s;t's Name, how concern'd &s;hould we be to give a due entertain|ment of their me&s;&s;ages, that are of infinite moment and concern to us all.</P>
<P>USE V. AND la&s;tly here, <HI>Let us pray for the Lord's Amba&s;|&s;adors, that GOD would qualify them for their Work, that he would a&s;&s;i&s;t and pro&s;per them in it. That the hand of the Lord may be with them, that many may believe and turn unto the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>BE thus asking the pre&s;ence and ble&s;&s;ing of the Lord, with all his Servants in the Mini&s;try: and let me recom|mend this duty in a particular manner to <HI>This Church and Congregation</HI> of the Lord, with re&s;pect <HI>(Fir&s;t)</HI> to your worthy and beloved <HI>Elder Pa&s;tor;</HI> that GOD wou'd re&s;tore and confirm his health, and yet grant a door of <HI>utterance</HI> to him, that he may &s;till labour among you in the word and doctrine, and be continued a rich ble&s;&s;ing to you, and that GOD would &s;antify the awful &s;wam in his being &s;o taken off
<PB N="10" REF="003764_0012_1002585A6F139AF0">from his work among you; and that tho&s;e divine &s;upports and con&s;olations may be vouch&s;afed to him, which may delight and refre&s;h his Soul in the multitude of his thoughts within him: And then, let me in the next place recommend this duty, with re&s;pect unto him, who may be allowed of GOD this day, to be put in tru&s;t with the Go&s;pel, and to whom the care of your precious Souls is to be committed. We tru&s;t he is given to you this day in an&s;wer to your prayers; and you mu&s;t now more than ever bear him upon your hearts in your humble and fervent &s;upplications to GOD for him. He is this day devot|ing him&s;elf to your &s;ervice, to be your Servant for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, to &s;pent, and be &s;pent for you. It is an awful Charge he is now going to receive from the Lord concerning you. He needs and he de&s;ires your Prayers. I be&s;eech you then, <HI>Brethren,</HI> for the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t's &s;ake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye &s;trive together with him in your prayers to GOD for him; that his Service in the Go&s;pel may be accepted of the Saints; that he may come to you with joy by the will of GOD, and be refre&s;hed; that he may come to you in the fulne&s;s of the ble&s;&s;ing of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t; that he may be made faithful to Chri&s;t, and to your Souls; that he may <HI>&s;peak not as plea&s;ing Men,</HI> but GOD the &s;earcher of hearts; that he may be a happy in&s;trument in the hands of GOD, of turning many here from the error of their ways, that many may be awaken'd and quickned by his Mini&s;try, and brought &s;avingly home to GOD, and that the Saints and Children of GOD may be edify'd and built up on their holy faith; in &s;hort, that he may have many Seals of his Mini&s;try among you, who may be his joy, and crown of rejoycing in the Day of Chri&s;t's appearing. To en|courage your thus praying, let me tell you, your prayers for him may be greatly &s;erviceable to the &s;ucce&s;s of his Mini&s;try among you. O beg of GOD to give the increa&s;e, with whom alone it is, and to whom alone the prai&s;e mu&s;t be a&s;cribed. Cry to GOD day and night for the &s;ucce&s;s of his labours among you, that he may not labour in vain and &s;pend his &s;trength for nought, that the word di&s;pen&s;ed by him may be a &s;avour of life unto life, and not of death unto death unto any of you. In this way you may hope to have his Mini&s;try made truly pro|fitable to your Souls, and if the Lord &s;hall plea&s;e to make it &s;o, he can de&s;ire no greater comfort or honour in this World.</P>

</LIST>
<P>I am to &s;hew,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>WHAT may be imply'd in God's trying our hearts.</HI> And,</P>
<P N="1">1. THIS certainly implys in general, <HI>that God is omni&s;cient.</HI> That all things are naked &amp; open before the eyes of that GOD, with whom we have to do, even the thoughts and intents of the Heart. That his eyes are as a flame of fire, running to and fro through the earth, beholding the evil and the good; that he may &s;hew him&s;elf &s;trong on the behalf of tho&s;e who&s;e hearts are upright with him. That he &s;earches the hearts and the reins of the children of men, that he may give to every one according to their ways and the fruit of their doings. Hereby may be meant that the great GOD has a perfect knowledge of all per&s;ons and things, and &s;ees them all, even that which is mo&s;t hidden and &s;ecret: That there is not a word in our tongue, nor a thought in our heart, but he knows it altogether.</P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P N="2">2. GOD's trying our hearts may imply and mean his critical in&s;pection and regard, <HI>as to the ends and de&s;igns we propo&s;e in undertaking the work of the Mini&s;try.</HI> When we engage in the work of the Mini&s;try, or any other bu&s;ine&s;s of importance, we have our &s;everal aims, ends and de&s;igns; and we are too prone to be led and carried on by corrupt and &s;mi&s;ter views and de&s;igns, and to have no &s;incere aims at the advancement of the glory of GOD, or the good and benefit of others. But now, the omni&s;cient God critically regards the views and ends, which govern and influence us in the pro&s;ecution of our duty. And this may be meant by his trying our hearts, that the Lord does e&s;pecially and accurately look to the ends we propo&s;e and are govern'd by, in the undertaking and pro&s;ecuting the work and duty incumbent on us in our &s;everal places and &s;tarion; and e&s;pecially in the awful &s;tarion, of the Mini&s;try.</P>

I proceed now to enquire</P>
<P N="2">2. WHAT may be meant by <HI>cur &s;peaking not as plea&s;ing Men,</HI> Or, when we may be &s;aid, <HI>to &s;peak not as plea&s;ing Men.</HI> Before I an&s;wer, I would briefly premi&s;e; that in &s;ome ca&s;es, we &s;hould and ought to plea&s;e Men. We find that the Apo&s;tle him&s;elf in &s;ome ca&s;es &s;ought to plea&s;e Men. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> X 33. But he plea&s;|ed not Men, nor &s;hould we, when it &s;tands in competition with plea&s;ing GOD. Otherwi&s;e the rule takes place with all, which we have given us in Rom. XV 2. <HI>Let every one of us plea&s;e his neighbour, for his good to edification.</HI> The Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;|pel may and &s;hould endeavour to choo&s;e our acceptable words, that may be plea&s;ing to their hearers. They may endeavour to plea&s;e Men, in their &s;peaking, &s;o they do but faithfully and plainly tell them their duty. And indeed this &s;hould be plea&s;ing to Men; but alas it's too often very unplea&s;ing and ungrateful. But to proceed, by way of An&s;wer,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>WE &s;peak not as plea&s;ing men, when we bear our Te&s;timony again&s;t the Sins they live in.</HI> Such as are in a carnal uncon|verted &s;tate, are not plea&s;ed with our &s;o &s;peaking. We &s;peak, not as plea&s;ing &s;uch, when we faithfully warn them to abandon the evil ways and practices they are living and indulging them|&s;elves in. When we tell them, &s;uch ways lead down to the chambers of death, and that they are ha&s;tening to a damnation that &s;lumbers not; when we tell them of the &s;nares, fire and brim&s;tone and an horrible tempe&s;t that &s;hall be the portion of their cup, unle&s;s they repent and turn; when we declare to them that if they cea&s;e not wandring out of the way of under|&s;tanding, they &s;hall go down to the congregation of the dead, have their portion appointed them with hypocrites and unbelie|vers, where they &s;hall weep and wail and gna&s;h their teeth for|ever; when we declare to them, This will be the end of the way they are walking in, and &s;olemnly warn them to for&s;ake the paths of the De&s;troyer; When we thus will not let them go on quietly in their &s;ins, we then &s;peak, <HI>not as plea&s;ing Men.</HI> And &s;uch won't regard what we &s;ay, becau&s;e we don't &s;peak &s;mooth things to them, but hard &s;ayings which they cannot bear. They'd mind us, if we wou'd prophe&s;y &s;mooth things to them, flatter them in ways of &s;in, and let them go on &s;ecurely. Of &s;uch the holy prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> complain'd in his time, in the 30th Chap. <HI>This is a rebellious people, lying children, children that will not bear the law of the Lord, which &s;ay to the Seers, &s;ee not, and to the Prophets, prophe&s;y not unto us right things, &s;peak unto us &s;mooth things, prophe&s;y deceits, get you cut of the way, turn a&s;ide cut of the path, cau&s;e the holy one of I&s;rael to cea&s;e from le&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve us.</HI> They forbid the Prophets &s;peaking to them in GOD's Name,

One &s;ays<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Henry.</NOTE> upon this place, It was their privilege, that they had &s;eers among them, but they did what they could to put out their eyes; they had prophets among them, but they did what they could to &s;top their mouths, for they made them unea&s;y in their wicked ways. The pro|phets told them of their faults, and warn'd them of their danger, and they could not bear that: they mu&s;t &s;peak to them &s;mooth things, mu&s;t flatter them in their &s;ins, and &s;ay they did well, and there was no harm, no danger in the cour&s;e of life they liv'd; let a thing be never &s;o right and true, if it be not &s;mooth, they will not hear it, but if it be agreable to the good opinion they have of them&s;elves, the' it be never &s;o fal&s;e, and never &s;o great a cheat upon them, they would have it prophe&s;y'd to them. They were for being let alone to do as they pleas'd, and therefore bid their faithful monitors to &s;tand out of the way; but the faithful prophets of the Lord won't be diverted from u&s;ing &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions as are proper to awaken &s;inners, tho' they may perhaps be di&s;plea&s;ing enough to them; &s;uch mu&s;t be told, that GOD is holy, and they &s;hall find him &s;o, &s;ooner or later, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear. Thus he.</P>
<P>BUT this may &s;uffice for the fir&s;t particular; the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t &s;peak, <HI>not as plea&s;ing men,</HI> when they bear their faithful te&s;timony again&s;t the vicious ways and cour&s;es they indulge them&s;elves in and warn them of their danger of a damnation to be trembled at, if they die in their &s;ins.</P>
<P>Again.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>WE &s;peak, not as plea&s;ing men, when we are from time to time earne&s;tly and faithfully calling on, and urging them to their duty.</HI> When we are, from one time to another, admoni&s;hing men for their neglects of duty, and calling on them to keep the commandments of GOD diligently; to deny them&s;elves, take up their cro&s;s, and follow the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; to renounce their lu&s;ts, to cut off their right hand, and to pluck out their right eye &s;ins. To be called on, to exerci&s;e &s;uch mortification and &s;elf-denyal, is not at all plea&s;ing to the corrupt and carnal hearts of men: They don't love to be urged to that which is &s;o contrary to the natural bent and di&s;po&s;ition of their hearts. It is not therefore plea&s;ing to them, to urge them to the duty of <HI>repentance,</HI> to hate and for&s;ake their beloved I &s;is; nor to the duty of <HI>believing</HI> in Chri&s;t, to renounce all righteou&s;ne&s;s of their own, and come to Chri&s;t, poor and mi&s;erable, blind and

They <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">are not to be &s;o re&s;trained. They choo&s;e to walk at large. Such <HI>re&s;traints</HI> are not (I &s;ay) at all plea&s;ing to them; and therefore when they are urged to a &s;trict regard to the will and command of GOD, as to a &s;ober, righteous and holy living, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is <HI>not plea&s;ing</HI> to them.

<P>THUS then we &s;peak, <HI>not as plea&s;ing men,</HI> when we are from time to time calling and urging them to their duty.</P>
<P>BEFORE I di&s;mi&s;s this enquiry, I might here particularly &s;ay; the <HI>Intemperate</HI> man does not care to have his intemperance rebuk'd and declaim'd again&s;t.

<P>THE <HI>covetous</HI> don't love to be rebuked for their inordinate and anxious regards to the world, and things of it; though they are like for ever to neglect the one thing needful, for the &s;ake of this world and &s;o l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e their Souls (by their folly) more worth than a thou&s;and worlds.</P>

THE <HI>Sabbath breakers;</HI> &s;uch as are vain, rude &amp; di&s;orderly on GOD's holy day, don't care to hear the frequent reproofs given them in the name of the Lord; tho' if they &s;hould e&s;cape puni&s;hment from men, they can't e&s;cape the righteous judgment of GOD, who is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ealous for the honour of his day, and will not let any profanations of it go unpuni&s;hed.

<P>BY thus dealing with the children of Men in the publick di&s;pen&s;ation of GOD's holy word, we may be &s;aid to <HI>&s;peak not as plea&s;ing men;</HI> when we thus reprove them for their wickedne&s;s, warn them of their danger, and urge them to reform, and do their duty, as they would avoid a mo&s;t fearfully aggravated condemnation, which will el&s;e belong unto them.</P>

<P>WHEN we endeavour plainly and faithfully to inform men of their duty, to &s;hew them their &s;in and mi&s;ery, and need of a Saviour.

<P>MINISTERS of the Go&s;pel are Chri&s;t's &s;ervants by office; and as &s;ervants, they are to plea&s;e their own ma&s;ter. <HI>If I plea&s;ed men,</HI> &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, <HI>I &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ould not be the &s;ervant of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> Gai 1. 10 And this made the Apo&s;tle have regard not only to his doctrine and outward conver&s;ation; but the inward aims and intentions of his heart; and expecting the reward of his labours more from GOD than men, he therefore &s;ought to plea&s;e GOD rather then men, and approve his heart unto him. And herein he reflects on tho&s;e fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;o Apo&s;tles, that &s;ought to plea&s;e men, that preach'd the law of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to plea&s;e the <HI>Jews;</HI> or others that perverted and abus'd the doctrine of the Go&s;pel to gratify the lu&s;ts of men. This our Apo&s;tle dared not to do; nor &s;hould any of the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t now: for it is required of &s;uch, that they be <HI>found faithful,</HI> I Cor. IV. 2. Now we can never be &s;o, if our great care be to plea&s;e men; we &s;hall then be afraid to deal plainly, clo&s;ely and faithfully with them: We &s;hall be loth to di&s;turb them in their &s;ecurity; &s;hall choo&s;e to let them go on in their evil ways, undi&s;turbed, rather than in|cur their di&s;plea&s;ure, and &s;o we &s;hall prove unfaithful to GOD, and the Sou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of men, and thus bring the guilt of blood upon our own heads.
