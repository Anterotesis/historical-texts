The <HI>New-Te&s;tament</HI>-Di&s;pen&s;ation, is ea&s;ier than the <HI>Old,</HI> being freed from the heavy and in|tolerable Yoke of the <HI>Ceremonial Law, that Hand-Writing of Ordinances is nail'd to the Cro&s;s of</HI> Chri&s;t. We have now no need of the co&s;tly and trouble&s;ome <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Sacrifices, or of their nu|merous ceremonious <HI>wa&s;hings</HI> and <HI>ob&s;ervances,</HI> di|vers of which were hard to be perform'd.</P>
<P>I might farther ob&s;erve, that the two afore&s;aid <HI>Di&s;pen&s;ations</HI> differ as to time. The one preceed|ed the Exhibition of the <HI>Me&s;&s;ias,</HI> and the other fol|lows it: The one re&s;pected the <HI>Me&s;&s;ias</HI> as to come, the other as come actually. Moreover the <HI>Old</HI> was to evani&s;h, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10. but the <HI>New</HI> to continue till the End of Time. <HI>Heb.</HI> vii. 16.</P>
