<HEAD>PREFACE. To the Reverend Mr. <HI>Peter Thacher,</HI> Modera|tor, and the honourable Council of <HI>Churches, Patrons</HI> of Regular Singing, this Book is humbly Dedicated.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE</HI> great Obstruction that Regular Singing has of late met with from a great Number of Per&s;ons, who being Ignorant of the U&s;e &amp; Excellency thereof, Vehemently decry it, and Violently Oppo&s;e it; (from whence has en&s;ued great Contention &amp; Di&s;cord among us;) has Occa&s;ioned the following Di&s;cour&s;e; which is only the fruit of or few &s;pare Hours. Since the Writing hereof, I have &s;een &s;everal Tracts about Singing, viz <HI>The Accompil&s;hed Singer;</HI> the <HI>Sweat P&s;almi&s;t of I&s;rael;</HI> and, <HI>A Di&s;cour&s;e about the Rea&s;on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">blene&s;s of Regular Singing:</HI> which I had never &s;een before The&s;e being made by Men of great Learning, may &s;eem to render the en&s;uing Di&s;cour&s;e u&s;ele&s;s; but tho' it be va&s;tly in|feriour to them, yet being on a &s;omething <HI>different</HI> Subject, and &s;hewing the <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of Regular Singing in the Wor&s;hip of GOD: I know not but it ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of &s;ome u&s;e to the Unlearned (for whom it it is de&s;igned;) For Moon light is &s;erviceable to tho&s;e that are benighted.

<P>He In&s;tructed about the Song becau&s;e he was Skillful.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THAT Singing of P&s;alms is a part of Di|vine Wor&s;hip, to be performed by the Peo|ple of GOD, in their Publick A&s;&s;emblies,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">not Including singing in Private.</NOTE> where they meet to Wor&s;hip Him, is a truth Generally Received; and the Practi&s;e of the Reformed Churches makes it fully Evident. That this is not only a Modern Practice, but was in u&s;e among the People of GOD in Elder Ages, is as evident, the Wor&s;hip of GOD both in the time of the Old Te&s;tament Di&s;pen&s;ation, and the New was not performed without it. In this Chapter we have an Account of a Grear Solemnity in the time of the Old Te&s;tament; It was that of <HI>David's</HI> bringing the Ark of GOD from the Hou&s;e of <HI>Obed Edom,</HI> to the Place he had Prepared for it And among other things there mentioned, we are told in the 16 <HI>ver&s;e,</HI> that <HI>David</HI> &s;pake to the Chief of the <HI>Levites,</HI> to appoint their Brethren to be the Singers, &amp;c. And in the Succeeding <HI>ver&s;es,</HI> we have an Account of the Manner of that Performance. In the <HI>ver&s;e</HI> wherein the Text is, 'tis &s;aid, <HI>And Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">naniah the Chief of the Levites was for Song.</HI> Then follow the Words to be In&s;i&s;ted on, <HI>viz He In&s;tructed about the Song becau&s;e he was Skillful.</HI> In the Words we may ob|&s;erve, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Something Implyed, which is, <HI>1&s;t. That P&s;almody is
<PB N="2" REF="002614_0004_0FDB758017C29C70">a part of Divine Wor&s;hip, which ought to be performed Regularly</HI> In&s;truction and Skill Imply Rule. <HI>2ly That it ought to be practi&s;ed in Publick Conventions for the Wor&s;hip of GOD.</HI> The Exerci&s;e the Text Relates to was in &s;uch a one. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Some|thing expre&s;&s;ed, wherein ob&s;erve <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> A Per&s;on In&s;tructing about the Song, who had the over&s;ight thereof, <HI>viz. Chenaniah. Secondly.</HI> The Rea&s;on why he had the over&s;ight thereof, <HI>viz Becau&s;e he was Skillful.</HI> From Hence ari&s;es this Doctrinal Truth.</P>
<P>DOCT. <HI>That to the Right or Regular Performance of the Duty of Singing P&s;alms, in the Publick Wor&s;hip of GOD, Good Skill is Nece&s;&s;ary, and Required in (at lea&s;t &s;ome of) them that Perform it</HI></P>
<P>I &s;ay <HI>[&s;ome of them]</HI> becau&s;e we find here an In&s;tructor, whence it follows that &s;ome were In&s;tructed; All are not capable to lead herein. It cannot be Expected that whole Congregations &s;hould be Skillful; but it is Nece&s;&s;ary that there be &s;ome and &s;uch a Number (at lea&s;t) as may Govern the P&s;almody, and be a Sufficient Guide to the Unskillful that the Service may be Regular, and becoming &s;o Sacred an Ex|erci&s;e, and a plea&s;ing Offering to the GOD of order, who requires as in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14. <HI>ult. Let all things be done in order.</HI> The <HI>Levites</HI> in a peculiar manner ought to be well skill'd herein.</P>
<P>THERE are Two Propo&s;itions contained in the Doctrine.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Fir&s;t. THAT Singing of P&s;alms as a part of the. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lick Wor|&s;hip of GOD, is of Divine In&s;titution, and a Duty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ncumbent on all the People of GOD.</HI></ITEM>

</LIST>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t THAT singing of P&s;alms as a part of the Publick Wor|ship of GOD, is of Divine In&s;titution, and a Duty Incumbent on all the People of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>THE Truth of this Propo&s;ition is abundantly Evident from the Scriptures. E&s;pecially the P&s;alms of <HI>David,</HI> which were D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ctated by the Spirit of GOD. Indiced and Pen'd for the u&s;e of the Church of GOD in all Ages, to be S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng in the Prai&s;es of GOD; And &s;ome whereof were Compo&s;ed in Par|ticular for the <HI>Sabbath Day,</HI> &s;co <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 92. Title: And in the
<PB N="3" REF="002614_0005_0FDB75843A6E86D0">100. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> we are Directed and Commanded to <HI>Enter God's Hou&s;e with prai&s;e.</HI> And <HI>David</HI> (the &s;weet P&s;almi&s;t of I&s;rael, as he is Stil'd in the 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 23.1.) not only Indited the P&s;alms (mo&s;t of 'em) and Sung 'em for his own Comfort and Sol|lace; but al&s;o Publi&s;hed them for the Service of GOD in the Church; And withal appointed the Singers and the Tunes fitting them, &s;ee 1 <HI>Chron</HI> 16 4 5 as the Titles of Sundry P&s;alms make Manife&s;t. And King <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> that good King and great Reformer Practi&s;ed agreeably, as may be &s;een in 2 <HI>Chron</HI> 29.30 And this was not only an Old Te&s;tament Service but al&s;o Commanded and Practi&s;ed in the New, &s;ee <HI>Eph.</HI> 5.19. <HI>Singing and making Melody in your Hearts to the Lord.</HI> And Col. 3.16. <HI>Singing to the Lord</HI> &amp;c And our SAVIOUR with his Di&s;ciples Practi&s;ed it, as in <HI>Matt.</HI> 26.30. and <HI>Mark</HI> 14.26. <HI>And when they had &s;ung an Hymn, they went forth,</HI> &amp;c. But this is a truth &s;o Generally Received, and Practi&s;ed by Chri&s;tians of all Den<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">minations, (almo&s;t) that I need not in&s;i&s;t thereon. I therefore proceed to the Second Propo&s;ition which I mainly intend which is.</P>
<P>PROP. the <HI>Second. THAT Singing of P&s;alms ought to be Performed Regularly, or with Skill</HI></P>
<P>FOR Illu&s;tration and Comfirmation of this Propo&s;ition, I &s;hall Inquire.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> WHAT is here meant by Skill, or what it is to Sing with Skill?</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Secondly.</HI> WHY this Skill is Nece&s;&s;ary in P&s;almody.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><HI>First.</HI> WHAT are we here to under&s;tand by Skill, or what it is to Sing with Skill?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> BY Skill in General is meant, Good Knowledge (from good In&s;truction and Experience) in any Art or Sci|ence: a good under&s;tanding of the Rules thereof. Skill Im|plies Rule and there is no Art without it. He that is acquain|ted with the Rules of any Art and by Practice h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s gain'd Expe|rience may be &s;aid to have Skill, &s;ee <HI>Exodus</HI> 31.3. &amp; Chap. 35.31. 1 <HI>Chron</HI> 22.15. and Chap. 28.21. But more Particularly, And</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t Negatively,</HI> THE Skill in Singing is not <HI>here</HI> to be un|der&s;tood of the Grace<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">that is another Subject.</NOTE> Required to be in Exerci&s;e in the Per|formance thereof; for tho&s;e that are mo&s;t Unskillful in the Vecal part may Exerci&s;e Grace therein: and the Gracious part appertaineth to tho&s;e Saints that were to be In&s;tructed,
<PB N="4" REF="002614_0006_0FDB7585397409D0">as well as to the In&s;tructor, and might be better Perform'd by 'em. Nor could he that In&s;tructed others furni&s;h 'em with that Grace in the lea&s;t mea&s;ure. Tho&s;e that by Natural Impediments are Rendred uncapable of Performing that Duty or Exerci&s;e with Skill, may yet do it with Grace, and be accepted of GOD therein: and are not faulty when they do their be&s;t as tho&s;e are, that have Power and Means to attain Skill, but Neglect to Improve them.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>Secondly and Affirmatively,</HI> BY Skill here is intended.</P>
<P>FIRST. KNOWLEDGE of, and Ability to Manage the Tunes, in which the P&s;alms are to be Sung according to the Rules thereof; &s;o as there may be <HI>Concord, Harmony</HI> and good <HI>Melody</HI> therein, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 33.3. <HI>Play Skillfully,</HI> or do well in Playing, or rather Singing <HI>i. e.</HI> Make good Mu&s;ick or Melody, and in this the Skill of <HI>Chenaniah</HI> was Imployed. Singing Implies <HI>Harmony</HI> and <HI>Melody.</HI> Every Plea&s;ant Noi&s;e or Voice is not Singing in this &s;en&s;e; <HI>Eph.</HI> 5.19 <HI>Making Melody</HI> &amp;c. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 51.3. Thanksgiving and the <HI>Voice</HI> of <HI>Melody,</HI> by which is meant Harmony, and a Sweet Mu&s;ical utterence of the Holy Song. In this <HI>Knowledge</HI> is more Particularly Implyed or Included.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> AN Acquaintance with the Rules of Mu&s;ick, the different Keys and the various Tones, Notes or sounds there|in; the Chords and Di&s;cords, how to Ri&s;e and Fall Gradually, or pa&s;s from Chord to Chord in an agreeable manner, how to keep Time, and to make proper Clo&s;es, and the like.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> A Mu&s;ical Ear, or an Ability to di&s;tingui&s;h be|tween the different Sounds in Mu&s;ick: A Quick Perception of what is Di&s;agreeable, Jarring and Immu&s;ical. This the Unskilful di&s;cern not, and therefore it is that they are &s;o in Love with, what they Ignorantly call the <HI>Good Old Way,</HI> and even Idolize it, while they Reject and Decry the <HI>Real Good Old Way</HI> of Rule and Order. But of this more hereafter.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> A Tuneable Voice, which may be Managed in an Agreeable manner, by the Direction of the Notes, to the making good Mu&s;ick or Melody. This to &s;ome is in a manner Natural; while others acquire it with great Pains and Diligence in Practice, but is Nece&s;&s;ary to that Skill we are &s;peaking of. As in any Craft, tho' a Man may have the Knowledge of all the parts and particulars thereof; yet Ex|cept he can u&s;e his Hands Ingeniou&s;ly to do the Work of it, he cannot be &s;aid to be Skillful therein: So Knowledge of
<PB N="5" REF="002614_0007_0FDB7586B63409A0">the Rules and the Notes and Characters of Mu&s;ick will not render a Man Skilful, Except he can Govern his Voice to make agreeable Sounds. Good Knowledge of Rules with an agreeable Dexterity to Practice them makes an Arti&s;t, and &s;uch as have attained the&s;e may be &s;aid to be Skilful indeed.</P>
<P>SECONDLY. BY Skill here may be intended, an Excel|lency therein, and a Superiour Degree of Knowledge there|about. In the Sacred Mu&s;ick there were <HI>Levites</HI> appointed for &s;everal Duties, and &s;ome to <HI>Ply</HI> and <HI>&s;et them forward</HI> and to <HI>be over</HI> the Re&s;t. 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 15.21. and the&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e &s;uch as Excelled in the Art of Singing, to whom Sundry P&s;alms were Directed and Intituled, that by their care and direction they might be Sung Excellently unto the End. There were in <HI>I&s;rael</HI> &s;ome <HI>Levites Singers</HI> that attended thereunto, and had no other charge; (&s;ee 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 9.33.) as <HI>Ayn&s;worth</HI> on <HI>P&s;alm</HI> 4. has noted. Tho' Skill be necee&s;&s;ary in all, in &s;ome Degree yet not alike in all; tho&s;e that appoint the Tunes, and lead therein &s;hould be capable to &s;uit them to the matter of the P&s;alms Sung, whither of Prayer, Confe&s;&s;ion. Lamentation or Prai&s;e; &s;ome of the Tunes are more <HI>Chearful,</HI> and &s;uited to P&s;alms of Prai&s;e; others more <HI>Melancholly,</HI> and &s;uited to P&s;alms of Prayer, Confe&s;&s;ion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which &s;hould be Regard|ed. This is manife&s;t by the Titles<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Ayn&s;worth on the Titles of the&s;e P&s;alms.</NOTE> of the P&s;alms (many of 'em) in &s;ome of which the <HI>Tunes</HI> were Directed, or at lea&s;t the Particular <HI>Keys</HI> on which they were Compo&s;ed, as in P&s;alm 46. <HI>Title; a Song upon Alamoth</HI> which &s;ignifies <HI>Virgins,</HI> and this P&s;alm &s;eems to be &s;ung by the <HI>Virgins</HI> at <HI>Solomons</HI> Wedding, and on the <HI>Treble</HI> al&s;o, becau&s;e &s;hrill like a <HI>Virgins</HI> Voice, And P&s;al. 9. Title, <HI>To the Chief Mu&s;ician upon Muth-Labben;</HI> this as Referred to the Mu&s;ick &s;eems to be a Tune on the Middle Key, <HI>viz</HI> the <HI>Medius,</HI> or <HI>Tenor,</HI> or <HI>Counter. Tenor,</HI> and P&s;alm 12. Title &mdash; <HI>upon Sheminith,</HI> or upon the Eight, or as the <HI>Chaldee</HI> Expoundeth it, the <HI>Eight Stringed Harp,</HI> or after the <HI>Eight,</HI> this is Referred to the Ba&s;s, being <HI>Grave, Solid</HI> &amp;c. <HI>David</HI> when he fetch'd home GOD's Ark, appointed &s;ome <HI>Levites</HI> with <HI>Harps</HI> upon the Eight, for the Honour and Ser|vice of GOD, as in the <HI>ver&s;e</HI> before the Text. The&s;e things point out to us, that Rules were ob&s;erved, Skill u&s;ed, and a great Degree thereof Nece&s;&s;ary to an agreeable Singing of the Prai&s;es of GOD. And here by the way 'tis worthy our
<PB N="6" REF="002614_0008_0FDB758C597A1840">Notice, That the <HI>Levites</HI> were Leaders in this Holy Exerci&s;e, and the&s;e (many of 'em) Excell'd in Skill and In&s;tructed others; which &s;hows that the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel ought to be Skillful herein, and &s;hould In&s;truct and lead their Peo|ple; which might be preventive of the Contentions and Differences that ari&s;e thereabout. I come now to the Se|cond Enquiry which is.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly. WHY is &s;uch Skill Nece&s;&s;ary in P&s;almody? or why ought it to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Regular, and Performed with Skill?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> RULE and Skill are Nece&s;&s;ary, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> In Regard to <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Decency. This</HI> of its own Nature brings &s;ome cir|cum&s;tantial Dignity and Comline&s;s to Divine Actions, as a Table and Cloath at the Communion, a Pulpit and Cloath or Cu&s;hion to a Sermon a clean and bright Ba&s;on for the Water at Bapti&s;m, and the like. This is Required in all the parts of GOD's Wor&s;hiip. As there are particular Rules given in the Scriptures in Ca&s;es that Require them, &s;o there are Rules that are more General: &s;ome things in the Wor&s;hip of GOD are Directed, (as to the Sub&s;tance thereof) by particular Rules, but the Circum&s;tances attending 'em are Directed only by General Rules; &s;uch as the Rules of ob&s;erving of Order, Decency and the like and the&s;e are left to Di&s;cretion, &s;ee 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14.40. <HI>Let all things be done Decently, and in Order.</HI> Now without Rule and Skill, it is Impo&s;&s;ible there &s;hould be either Decency or Order, as will appear under the next Particular, which has a near Relation with this <HI>viz.</HI> That Rule and Skill are Nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly. TO Prevent Di&s;cord and Confu&s;ion, in the Exerci&s;e of Singing.</HI> The&s;e are contrary to GOD and to all Religion, as in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14 33. <HI>God is not the Author of Confu&s;ion,</HI> &amp;c. It is for Order's &s;ake that the P&s;alms are put into Metre. The <HI>Hebrew Poe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e</HI> was doubtle&s;s accommodated to their way of Singing, and agreeable to Rule and Art: and our P&s;alms are therefore Metrically Tran&s;lated, that they might be adapted to the Rules of P&s;almody. The Lines are mea&s;ured by Syllables, which Requires &s;o many particular Sounds, di|rected by the Notes both as to their Length, and their Mu&s;i|cal Ri&s;ing and Falling. Now when Men are void of Skill herein, and unacquainted with the Rules thereof, it is Im|po&s;&s;ible they &s;hold agree to make <HI>one Sound,</HI> or an <HI>even Sound;</HI> &s;uch an one as is di&s;cribed and was practi&s;ed in 2 <HI>Chron</HI> 5 13. which is made by Ri&s;ing and Falling of the Voice coincidently
<PB N="7" REF="002614_0009_0FDB758DC43A4A68">and in Union altogether, and duly keeping time, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">olation of Voice by which means a whole Congregation may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d to make but one Sound. Where there is no Rule, Mens Fancies (by which they are govern'd) are various; &s;ome affect a Quavering Flouri&s;h on one Note, and others upon another which (becau&s;e they are Ignorant of true Mu&s;ick or Melody) they account a Grace to the Tune; and while &s;ome affect a quicker Motion, others affect a &s;lower, and draw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> out their Notes beyond all Rea&s;on, hence in Congre+gations en&s;ue Jarrs &amp; Di&s;cords, which make the Singing (rather) re&s;emble Howling: And their drawing our the Notes to &s;uch a length is the occa&s;ion of their Tittering <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and down, as if the Tunes were all compo&s;ed of Quavers, and make 'em re&s;emble Tunes to Dance to. <HI>Further,</HI> The want of Rule &amp; Skill is the rea&s;on why every Congregation almo&s;t has a different way of Singing. So that when Per|&s;ons are occa&s;ionally abroad, and joy with a Neighbouring Congregation in the Wor&s;hip of GOD, they are o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> un|capable of Singing with 'em. Thus 'tis often at Lectures, and e&s;pecially at Ordinations, where People of many Con|gregations Meet together, their ways of Singing are &s;o different, that 'tis not ea&s;y to know what Tune is Sung, and in Reality there is none: 'Tis rather Jumble &amp; Confu&s;ion, Altho' they all, doubtle&s;s, intend &s;ome Tune or other, and it may be, the &s;ame yet they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iffer almo&s;t as much as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> every one Sang a different Tune. This I have often ob|&s;erved all which is owing to the want of Knowledge of the Rules of Singing and of Skill to improve and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ge 'em.

<P N="2"><PB N="11" REF="002614_0013_0FDB7593D8864648">
2. IN the Church of I&s;rael, Vocal Mu&s;ick was in u&s;e, as well as In&s;trumental, el&s;e to what End, were the P&s;alme Me|trically compo&s;ed, which are Divine Songs: The Title of one being, <HI>To the chie&s; Mu&s;ician, a P&s;alm or Song.</HI> And others of the like Import: And they were Sung by <HI>David,</HI> and others of the People of GOD. And In&s;truments could not Articulate the Sounds of the words of the P&s;almi&s;t; in 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 29.30. 'tis &s;aid, <HI>They prai&s;ed God, in the words of Da|vid and A&s;aph.</HI> Hence that Objection appears invalid.</P>
<P>Object. 2. <HI>IF the Tunes (as the P&s;alms are) were of Divine In&s;piration, or had we the Hebrew Tunes; then it were Rea&s;onable to conform to them and endeavour after Skill; but &s;ince we have not tho&s;e, we have no Rule at all: nor do we &s;ee Rule nece&s;&s;ary.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> THO' we have not the Notes of the Hebrew P&s;alm Tunes, (which might for ought I know be divinely In&s;pi|red) (as &s;ome of the Titles of the P&s;alms &s;eem to Intimate) Or, the Prophets and Sacred Mu&s;icians that directed them, were at lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;ted, with the Divine Concour&s;e and Influ|ence, <HI>Exod.</HI> 31.2, 3. Yet this is no ju&s;t Bar to our way of Regular Singing, or ju&s;t Objection again&s;t our Tunes, or the Skill of our Compo&s;ers, or Ma&s;ters of Mu&s;ick. If the Hebrew Tunes had been Nece&s;&s;ary for us, they would, no doubt have been pre&s;erved, with the P&s;alms for our u&s;e; but the Hebrew Metres differ from the Metres of other Languages, which makes it inconvenient for us to u&s;e their Tunes, if we had them; which tho&s;e who are Skill'd in the Languages, do well know. And when the P&s;alms were fir&s;t Tran&s;lated into Engli&s;h Metre, fit to be Sung, Per&s;ons of Skill in Mu&s;ick, Compo&s;ed Tunes to fit the Ver&s;ion; &s;ome of which Tunes are affixed to our P&s;alm books, and the Singing of them according to the Notes in our P&s;alm|books, is by &s;ome commonly called, The New Way of Singing. And tho' the Hebrew Tunes have not been Pre|&s;erved, as we know of; yet the Skill, and general Rules of Singing, have doubtle&s;s been Retained (as well as of other Arts &amp; Sciences, <HI>Logick. Philo&s;ophy,</HI> and the like) from Age to Age, 'till now: &s;everal of which are plainly di&s;cerned in the Scriptures, (as in the Book of <HI>Jeb,</HI> and &s;ome of the pro|phets, and more in the New. Te&s;tament:) And this is a &s;ufficient Warrant for us to improve our Skill in compo&s;ing
<PB N="12" REF="002614_0014_0FDB759985FAF5C8">and u&s;ing Tunes for P&s;alms, which comes under the general Rule, and Command of Singing them with <HI>Decency &amp; Order.</HI></P>
<P>Obj. 3. <HI>THIS way of Singing, &s;eems to be derived from the</HI> French, <HI>and looks like Popery; and it &s;eems to be Introductory there unto.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 1. SUPPOSE the Popi&s;h party to u&s;e it that is no|thing to us, nor it is a ju&s;t bar to our u&s;e of it; if we mu&s;t forbear the u&s;e of any thing in the Wor&s;hip of GOD, on this &s;core, we mu&s;t forbear preaching or Believing the Doctrine of the Trinity, and the Hypo&s;tatical Union, with many other Important Doctrines, of Chri&s;tianity, which they Believe, Preach, and pretend to Practice agreeable to, but do not.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE thing is not true in Fact: for there is no Eng|li&s;h, or other Popi&s;h Church, that Sing Ma&s;s, as we by our Notes Sing P&s;alms. And it may as well be Objected, that all Singing, is Popery becau&s;e they Sing Ma&s;s, and the like, tho' in a Va&s;tly different way of Singing: Singing of P&s;alms Regularly, in Grave, Solemn Tunes, was from GOD, before Popery appear'd.</P>
<P N="3">3. WHILE the&s;e People, that thus object, pretend a mighty fear of Popery, they Really imbrace it, in one of its Main Tenets. 'Tis a Popi&s;h Tenet, that <HI>Ignorance</HI> is the Mother of Devotion; and <HI>this</HI> they greatly Affect, and wil|fully continue in; decrying all Rule &amp; Learning, and due Means of Knowledge; affecting only a blind Rulele&s;s Per|formance of Devotion. I mean, as to the Vocal part of it, in which yet, Exactne&s;s, and Rule &amp; Skill are Required, as has been proved.</P>
<P>Obj. 4. <HI>THE fourth Objection I take Notice of in &s;ome, is again&s;t the Tone u&s;ed in Singing by Rule; and the particular Syl|lables</HI> Mi Fa Sol La, <HI>u&s;ed in Learning; &s;ome calling it a Negro Tone, others <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">c squeaking Tone, unbeeoming the Wor&s;hip of GOD, and the Syllables,</HI> Fa Sol La Mi, <HI>are the great ob&s;tacles to them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> THIS is a mo&s;t Fooli&s;h Objection, not worthy the An&s;wering; but &s;ince 'tis made I &s;hall brie&s;ly An&s;wer it thus: Whether it be a Negro Tone or no, I am &s;ure it is an Engli&s;h Tone, and a Solemn Mu&s;ical Tone; a Clear, Smooth, Even Prea&s;ant Tone; and by their pretending <HI>[Mi, Sol, Fa, La,]</HI> to be unbecoming the Wor&s;hip of GOD, they
<PB N="13" REF="002614_0015_0FDB759B2433F990">mu&s;t mean either that tho&s;e Syllables are <HI>in that form</HI> Sung in the Wor&s;hip of GOD, or el&s;e that the Singing of Tunes only, is a part of GOD's Wor&s;hip. If they mean <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e fir&s;t, 'tis what is not intended or u&s;ed in the Wor&s;hip of GOD. If they mean the &s;econd, it &s;hews their great Ignorance, that Imagine a Tune only, a part which is only an Adjunct of Divine Wor&s;hip. But that tho&s;e Syllables as pronounced, are not unbecoming the Wor&s;hippers of GOD, appears in that among other Syllables the P&s;alms in Engli&s;h do abound with them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>&s;ee P&s;al,</HI> 27.10. <HI>and P&s;al.</HI> 89.26. <HI>to</HI> 30. <HI>al&s;o P&s;al.</HI> 42.5.3. <HI>to</HI> 11. <HI>and in many more.</HI></NOTE> as in the words, <HI>My Farther, &mdash; My Soul. &mdash; My Law,</HI> &mdash; which are the &s;ame Sound with <HI>Mi Fa Mi Sol Mi La.</HI> But to proceed.</P>
<P>Obj. 5. and la&s;t, <HI>I &s;hall take notice of is this, The Apo&s;tle directs us, as in</HI> Eph. 5.19. <HI>and</HI> Col. 3.16. <HI>To make Melody in our Hearts to the Lord, and to Sing with Grace in our Hearts,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and this is Sufficient whether we Regard Rule or no, as to the External Part.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> THE Apo&s;tles Intention here is not to Abrogate that Skill or Rule, which Skill is &s;uppo&s;ed or Implied in the words <HI>Singing</HI> and <HI>Melody;</HI> but to &s;hew that there withall it was Nece&s;&s;ary to Exerci&s;e Grace in order to Divine accept|ance.

<P>I Now Proceed to the APPLICATION.</P>
<P>AND the Fir&s;t u&s;e is of Information. <HI>Hence we learn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t, That it's the Duty of all Chri&s;tians to Labour after the Attainment of Good Skill, in P&s;almody, or Regular Singing.</HI> If Singing of P&s;alms be a Duty Incumbent on all Per&s;ons Capable thereof, and Skill be Required in the Performance of it, as has been &s;hewed; then it Nece&s;&s;arily follows, 'tis the Duty of all to Labour after the obtainment of it, and to Pray to GOD for it. Where a Duty is Impo&s;ed and Injoyned and Rules given therefor, the Per&s;ons on whom the Duty is Incumbent, ought to acquaint them&s;elves with the Rules thereof, or el&s;e they cannot perform the Duty in an Agreeable manner, and to Acceptance.

<P N="2">2ly. <HI>HENCE it appears that &s;uch as</HI> oppo&s;e <HI>Regular Sing|ing are greatly to blame; the&s;e di&s;cover great Ignorance and Folly, and are the Authours of Great Di&s;order and Confu&s;ion in the Wor&s;hip of GOD; which is greatly di&s;plea&s;ing to Him.</HI> To do <HI>thus</HI> is to Deba&s;e the Rational Nature, and to Act below the Powers and Faculties with which GOD has Endowed us.

<P N="3">3ly. <HI>HENCE we &s;ee that when a People have deviated from, or have lo&s;t the Rules of P&s;almody, it is their Duty to become &s;en&s;ible of their Error, and to Reform.</HI> Reformation is always, and in all ca&s;es a Duty, where there has been an Apo&s;tacy or Deviation from the Rules by Scripture required to be ob&s;erved, <HI>Jer.</HI> 3.6, to 22. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 55, 7.

<P>USE 3.

There is certainly &s;omething which you propound as your end in Learning to Sing, if it be not to make you the more capable in an agreable manner, to Sing the Prai&s;es of GOD, 'tis a wrong end. A Plea&s;ant and Strong Voice with Ability to Modulate the &s;ame, is the Gift of GOD, and a Tallent that &s;hould be Improved to the Glory of his Name. And tho' the

<P>THE La&s;t U&s;e is of Exhortation to all Per&s;ons to Endeavour a Devout performance of the Duty of Singing of P&s;alms. As Skill is nece&s;&s;ary to an agreable performance of the Exteriour or Vocal part, &s;o Grace is much more nece&s;&s;ary to a Right performance of the Interiour Spiritual part. It was the complaint of GOD concerning his People of Old, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 29.13. <HI>This People draw nigh me with the Mouth and Honour me with the Lip, but their Hearts are far from me.</HI> It is to be feared, that as to a great Number of People among us (and e&s;pecially in this time of Temptation) it may be &s;aid of their Singing, as the <HI>Phylo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pher</HI> &s;aid of the little Singing Bird, call'd the <HI>Nigh|tingale, viz.</HI> that it was <HI>Vox et piaeteria inh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l.</HI> Voice and nothing el&s;e; their Throats like the Pipes of the <HI>Organs,</HI> being fill'd with Wind make a P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ant Sound, but their Hearts are no ways ingaged in the Prai&s;es of GOD Where 'tis thus it mu&s;t needs be very di&s;plea&s;ing to Him. Man's Heart is the object of GOD's Eye in an e&s;pecial manner; and in all our Religious Performances, the Devotion of the Heart is Expected and Recalled: and in our P&s;almody when we

Whatever our Thoughts are as to the Mode or Vocal part, whether the Old, or the New way (as they are call'd) be mo&s;t plea&s;ing to us, it would be our Wi&s;dom and a Manife&s;tation of our Chri&s;tiani|ty-to deny our Selves, and <HI>our own ob&s;tinate wills,</HI> which are apparently the chief cau&s;e of Contention in the&s;e things, and Conde&s;cend (at lea&s;t) &s;o far one to the other, as to keep come alike <HI>i. e.</HI> to begin and end the lines all together, which if we did, there would not in mo&s;t of the Tunes commonly Sung, be &s;o wide a difference as is by &s;ome Imagined, many of the lines being near alike; if we all Sincerely Endeavour to Exerci&s;e Grace in Singing, and to perform the Vocal pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">on the be&s;t manner we could, our Services would be accepted of GOD.
