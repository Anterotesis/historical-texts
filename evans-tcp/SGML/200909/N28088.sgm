<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE editors of the following pathetic and animating exhortations, conceive it a duty they owe to the memory of the decea&s;ed preacher to acknow|ledge, that the author though repeatedly &s;olicited, ne|ver gave his approbation to the publication of them, owing perhaps in part to motives of delicacy. They were neverthele&s;s publi&s;hed in his day, and read with avidity, &s;everal of them having high encomiums pa&s;|&s;ed upon them, in the Critical and Monthly Re|views, the mo&s;t approved te&s;timonies of the value of any production offered to the public from the pre&s;s.</P>
<P>The preacher being now, by his removal from this fate of probation, far beyond the reach of human cen|&s;ure or the influence of human adulation, we are the more induced to a republication of them; believing that the valuable matter they contain, whil&s;t it cannot fail to gratify the &s;earcher after <HI>Oratory</HI> is al&s;o emi|nently calculated to animate the &s;oul to the pur&s;uit of virtue.</P>
<P>It may perhaps be nece&s;&s;ary to remark, on account of tho&s;e unacquainted with the Tenets of the &s;ociety
<PB N="iv" REF="037439_0003_100D42F3259AA5E0">
with which the preacher was united in religious com|munion, that they hold not with delivering written or &s;tudied di&s;cour&s;es, and that con&s;i&s;tently therewith, the following &s;ermons were delivered <HI>extempore,</HI> and taken down in characters as they flowed from the lips of the preacher, being the pure effu&s;ions of a heart animated with the love of the Univer&s;al Parent of mankind, and ardently &s;olicitous for the good of &s;ouls &mdash;or, as a certain writer has expre&s;&s;ed of him "his voice was lifted up in an extemporaneous effu&s;ion of rapturous eloquence, which being attended with &s;upe|rior power and &s;olemnity, at once captivated the ear, and made contrite the heart."</P>
<P>Far be it from us to multiply encomiums&mdash;we wi&s;h not to exalt the in&s;trument; but rather to &s;timulate to the pur&s;uit, not only of tho&s;e virtues &s;o eminently characteri&s;tic of him; but al&s;o, &s;o abundantly di&s;play|ed in the following communications, and which need from us no comment.</P>
<P>We &s;hall only add for the information of tho&s;e into who&s;e hands former American Editions of Fothergills &s;ermons may have fallen, that the pre&s;ent publication contains an addition of four others delivered by him, and never before printed in this country&mdash;the peru&s;al of which, we doubt not, will be equally acceptable with the former, and found to contain matter no le&s;s valuable and in&s;tructive.</P>

<HEAD>CHARACTER OF THE LATE Mr. <HI>SAMUEL FOTHERGILL,</HI> BROTHER TO THE PHYSICIAN DR. FOTHERGILL</HEAD>
<P>TO commemorate the virtues of great and emi|nent men, who have been honourable in their day, is a tribute due to their memory. A tribute which &s;en&s;ible men pay from emotions of re&s;pectful gratitude; and from a hope that it may prove an incentive to the living to emulate their virtues.</P>
<P>Of this cla&s;s the late Mr. SAMUEL FOTHERGILL, of Warrington, an eminent preacher among the
<PB N="vi" REF="037439_0005_100D42F706E486C0">
Quakers, may with great ju&s;tice be ranked. I knew him well, and had the happine&s;s of his occa&s;ional acquaintance; I call it the happine&s;s, becau&s;e I never enjoyed the company of any per&s;on from whom I received more real &s;atisfaction; and however diver|&s;ified with affliction, the future part of my life may prove, I &s;hall never remember tho&s;e hours I have &s;pent with him, but with peculiar plea&s;ure. He was an happy compound of the gentleman and the chri&s;tian; the virtues and amiable qualities of each character being admirably blended in him. Graceful in his deportment, ea&s;y and affable in his manner, he commanded both re&s;pect and love; he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed natural abilities far &s;uperior to the general|ity of mankind, and improved them to the utmo&s;t of his power. Well read both in books and men, his &s;tudies did not terminate in barren &s;peculation; but the great truths of religion were deeply implanted in his heart, and beamed forth illu&s;triou&s;ly in a be|nevolent and truly chri&s;tian conduct.</P>
<P>As a member of civil &s;ociety he was exceedingly u&s;eful, filling up the &s;ocial and relative duties of life with great propriety. Blamele&s;s in his manners, kind, charitable, and ready on all occa&s;ions to de|vote his time and talents to promote the be&s;t of all
<PB N="vii" REF="037439_0006_100D42F9AB96CC58">
cau&s;es, the good of mankind. He lived beloved, and his lo&s;s is deeply deplored by all who had the happine&s;s of knowing his worth.</P>
<P>As a preacher, he was far &s;uperior to mo&s;t who fill up that &s;tation: Sound in the important doctrines of the chri&s;tian faith, he endeavoured to promote them univer&s;ally, with the greate&s;t energy of lan|guage, and the mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive eloquence. In this capacity he was indeed truly great; and his greatne&s;s received additional lu&s;tre from his humility. Al|though followed by numbers, and courted by per|&s;ons of &s;uperior rank and &s;tation, and admired by tho&s;e of all per&s;ua&s;ions, the applau&s;e which his emi|nence ju&s;tly acquired, did not exalt, but evidently tended to make him humble. He was a per&s;on of an enlarged mind, zealous without bigotry, and a &s;teady promoter of univer&s;al charity. In his &s;er|mons, it was evident to all his intelligent hearers that he deeply felt the force of tho&s;e &s;olemn truths he delivered; and his manner of di&s;playing them was &s;o ju&s;tly emphatical, that none but the in&s;en&s;ible or obdurate could with&s;tand their force, or remain unaffected by them. He travelled much from the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted motives, among his friends in
<PB N="viii" REF="037439_0007_100D42FBC4499C48">
Great-Britain, Ireland, and the American Colonies, for the promotion of piety and chri&s;tian virtue, and for the advancement of that faith and religion in which he mo&s;t &s;urely believed, and was &s;o eminent an example.</P>
<P>During the latter part of his life he was much in|di&s;po&s;ed in his health; but (as I have heard from the be&s;t authority) perfectly happy and ea&s;y in his mind, having an evidence in him&s;elf that he was approaching that &s;tate of felicity which is prepared for the righteous. This evidence &s;upported him through the remains of a painful life, and was his unfailing hope in the awful hour of death, which (when near his end) he declared, "Had no terrors, nor would the grave have any victory." And al&s;o added, "That as he had lived, &s;o he &s;hould clo&s;e with the mo&s;t un&s;haken a&s;&s;urance, that he had not followed cunningly devi&s;ed fables, but the pure li|ving and eternal &s;ub&s;tance." Such was his exemplary life&mdash;Such his triumphant death!</P>
<P>A life &s;o &s;pent is truly honourable&mdash;And &s;uch a death un&s;peakably glorious.</P>

<P>ON the 15th in&s;tant, paid the la&s;t debt of nature, Mr. SAMUEL FOTHERGILL, of Warrington, an eminent Preacher among&s;t the people called Qua|kers, endowed with qualifications &s;uperior to mo&s;t, and animated by a zeal truly apo&s;tolic, he long preached the interre&s;ting truths of the go&s;pel to mankind; whil&s;t the uniform tenor of his life, de|voted to religion and &s;pent in the practice of eve|ry virtue, was the &s;tronge&s;t comment on his doc|trine.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="biography">
<HEAD>A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF <HI>SAMUEL FOTHERGILL,</HI> BY HIS BRETHREN IN RELIGIOUS PROFESSION.</HEAD>
<P>SAMUEL FOTHERGILL, of Warrington in Lanca&s;hire, was the &s;ixth &s;on of our worthy anci|ent friend JOHN FOTHERGILL, mentioned in this Treati&s;e; &s;ee page 29, and of MARGARET his wife, for an account of whom &s;ee volume the &s;ixth, page 90, of Piety promoted.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="037439_0009_100D43002D16D0F0">This their &s;on being of an active and lively di&s;|po&s;ition, and during his apprentice&s;hip mo&s;tly from under the watchful eye of his affectionate parent, he fled from the Holy Cro&s;s of CHRIST, and indulged him|&s;elf in the gratifications of folly and licentiou&s;ne&s;s; violating the repeated convictions of divine grace in his own mind, which had been mercifully extended from his early years, thereby wounding the &s;oul of his tender father (of who&s;e religious care to form and lead the tender minds of his children to piety and virtue, we have an account in the memoirs of his life;) yet his pious admonitions proved never|thele&s;s, as bread ca&s;t on the waters, which returned after many days; for about the twenty-fir&s;t year of his age, the vi&s;itation of divine love was &s;o power|fully renewed, that it proved effectual to turn his &s;teps out of the paths of vanity; and as he has expre&s;&s;ed, with humble and awful gratitude to the pre&s;erver of men, "It then appeared clear to his under&s;tanding, that would be the la&s;t call the heavenly father would &s;avour him with;" he therefore con&s;ulted no longer with fle&s;h and blood, but gave up to the holy vi&s;itation, devoting his whole heart and affections to &s;eek reconci|liation with GOD, through the mediation of JE|SUS CHRIST; and abiding in great humility under the purifying operation of the Holy Gho&s;t and fire, he became thereby qualified for tho&s;e eminent &s;ervi|ces he was called into; for in a few months, by the con&s;training power and love of GOD his mouth was opened to bear a te&s;timony to the &s;ufficiency of that
<PB N="xi" REF="037439_0010_100D430280B7B740">
holy arm that had plucked him as a brand out of the fire. Thus a di&s;pen&s;ation of the mini&s;try being com|mitted to his charge, he attended faithfully thereto, and moved therein at the requirings, and under the direction of divine wi&s;dom, by which means he &s;oon became an able mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel, called thereto and qualified by the Holy Gho&s;t, under which influence he laboured with diligence and de|voted much of his time and &s;trength, when health permitted, to the &s;ervice of his dear LORD and MASTER; for the continuance of who&s;e &s;avours he counted nothing too near or dear to part with, that he might be in&s;trumental in gathering &s;ouls to GOD, which was the object he had in view in all his go&s;|pel labours; being diligent him&s;elf, he endeavoured much to excite friends to a due and con&s;tant atten|dance of meetings for religious wor&s;hip, and tho&s;e for the di&s;cipline of the church.</P>
<P>Through the cour&s;e of his go&s;pel labours, both in public and private, animated by divine love, he expre&s;&s;ed an uncommon warmth of affection for the ri&s;ing youth of this generation, with whom he has been frequently led into a deep brotherly feeling and &s;ympathy for their pre&s;ent and eternal welfare; un|der which concern his love to this cla&s;s of both &s;exes under all denominations, was &s;trong and ardent.</P>
<P>He travelled much in this Nation and Scotland, &s;everal times in Ireland, and once through mo&s;t of
<PB N="xii" REF="037439_0011_100D4305D7C32910">
the North American Colonies, in the &s;ervice of truth; where, though &s;ingularly humbled in a &s;en&s;e of poverty, weakne&s;s and in&s;ufficiency on his fir&s;t landing, he was by accounts received, marvellou&s;ly &s;trengthened, both in public and private, in go&s;pel authority and love, to the awakening and comforting of many.</P>
<P>In the forepart of the year 1769, he vi&s;ited mo&s;t of the families of friends in the monthly-meeting of Grace-church &s;treet, London; in which &s;ervice he was divinely &s;trengthened and enabled to extend a helping hand to many in clo&s;e and nece&s;&s;ary labour, for their increa&s;ing care, to live and act con&s;i&s;tent with our holy profe&s;&s;ion, to the comfort and help of divers, and his own peace: and afterwards, at two different opportunities, he vi&s;ited the families of friends in Hor&s;leydown and We&s;tmin&s;ter monthly-meetings in that city, to the &s;ame good effect.</P>
<P>He mo&s;tly attended the yearly-meetings in Lon|don, and other places, when of bodily ability; in which his go&s;pel labours were very acceptable and edifying; being particularly careful when called from home, to return to his family and friends with as much expedition as the nature of his &s;ervice would admit.</P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="037439_0012_100D430763A4F060">Having acquired a moderate competency by his diligence and indu&s;try, he declined trade for &s;everal years before his decea&s;e, devoting his time and tal|ents to the &s;ervice of the churches. As a pillar in the Lords hou&s;e he was &s;tedfa&s;t, being actuated by a chri&s;tian and manly zeal; in deportment grave: his private conver&s;ation was &s;avory and edifying, corre&s;ponding with his mini&s;try, which at times went forth as a flame, piercing the obdurate, yet de&s;cended like dew upon the tender plants of our heavenly Fathers planting, the true mourners in Zi|on, with the&s;e he travelled in a deep &s;ympathy of &s;pirit; in his go&s;pel labours free from affectation, in doctrine clear, found and pathetic, filled with cha|rity, allowing for the prejudices of mankind, being indeed a mini&s;ter and elder worthy of double honour, &s;peaking whereof he knew, and what his own hands had handled of the good word of life.</P>
<P>He endured a long and painful illne&s;s with much patience and re&s;ignation, and towards the clo&s;e of his time expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to &s;ome of his relations, when they took leave him, previous to their &s;etting out for the yearly-meeting in London, to the following effect.</P>
<P><HI>Our health is no more at our command, than length of days:&mdash;Mine seems drawing fast towards a conclusions;
<PB N="xiv" REF="037439_0013_100D430A72B231F8">
but I am content with every allotment of Providence, for they are all in wisdom, &mdash;unerring wisdom.</HI></P>
<P><HI>There is one thing which as an arm underneath, bears up and supports; and though the rolling tempestuous billows surround, yet my head is kept above them, and my feet are firmly established. &mdash;O! seek it, &mdash;press after it, &mdash;lay fast hold of it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Though painful my nights, and wearisome my days, yet I am preserved in patience and resignation. &mdash;Death has no terrors, nor will the grave have any victory. &mdash; My soul triumphs over death, hell and the grave.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Husbands and wives, parents and children, health and riches, must all go&mdash;disappointment is another name for them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I should have been thankful had I been able to have got to the ensuing yearly-meeting in London, which you are now going to attend, where I have been so often re|freshed with my brethren; but it is otherwise allotted: I &s;hall remember them, and some of them will remember me. &mdash;The Lord knows best what is best for us; I am content and resigned to his will.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I feel a &s;oretaste of that joy that is to come;&mdash;and who would wish to change such a state of mind?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="xv" REF="037439_0014_100D430D056F3088"><HI>I should be glad if an easy channel could be found to inform the yearly-meeting that as I have lived, so I shall close, with the most unshaken assurance, that we have not followed cunningly devised fables, but the pure living eternal substance.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Let the aged be strong, let the middle aged be anima|ted, and the youth encouraged; for the Lord is still with Zion; the Lord will bless Zion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If I be now removed out of his church militant, where I have endeavoured in some measure to fill up my duty, I have an evidence that I shall gain an admittance into his glorious church triumphant, far above the heavens.</HI></P>
<P><HI>My dear love is to all them that love the Lord Jesus.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A DISCOURSE DELIVERED AT BINGLEY, THE 3RD OF THE SEVENTH MONTH, 1758.</HEAD>
<P>THE excellent proverbs di&s;cover the full trea|&s;ure of religion with its durable riches and honours; and call &s;ouls to be true lovers thereof, and to inherit wi&s;dom. From this holy foundation, the riches of all generations have been drawn; and, whenever we are truly enriched, we mu&s;t derive our trea&s;ure from heaven; for, it is the &s;oul that &s;hall inherit glory: and where &s;hall be the produc|tion of good but in God? There is, beyond all manner of contradiction, abundance of difference in the natural capacities of mankind; in the various advantages or di&s;advantages that occur in the op|portunities of acquiring knowledge, and the en|largement of the natural under&s;tanding; for, &s;o it hath &s;eemed good and right, in the holy wi&s;dom of
<PB N="2" REF="037439_0019_100D431A084F3E38">
him who commands the &s;pirits to enter into all fle&s;h, and appoints even the &s;tars and heavenly bo|dies to differ in magnitude and glory one from ano|ther. But it admits not of the lea&s;t doubt with me that the holy one, who&s;e ways are equal (and who, with a &s;olemn a&s;&s;ertion, declares, he delights not in the death of them that die) hath formed each of us, however differing in point of capacity or ac|quired knowledge, for glory, honour, immortality, and eternal life, and hath provided means for ob|taining this great and univer&s;al end. For his will is not our de&s;truction, but our &s;anctification, our ju&s;tification, and adoption into glory, that we might each of us be happy here, and eternally happy with him for ever.</P>
<P>That wi&s;dom which calls us to eternal peace, to inherit &s;ub&s;tance, was with the Ancient of Days before the foundations of the world were laid, as one brought up with him and was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him. That attribute of the Almighty, which makes him famous and excellent throughout all his name; that wi&s;dom in and by which the univer&s;e was formed, and in which it re&s;ted compleatly beautiful, as coming out of the hands of a pure and holy creator, when the morning &s;tars &s;ung together and the &s;ons of God &s;houted for joy; this wi&s;dom, in which all God's workman&s;hip was formed, was the great cau&s;e of their holy ad|miration,
<PB N="3" REF="037439_0020_100D2F36DD5C01A8">
and the &s;ubject of their cele&s;tial &s;ong. And all that he has created anew, was by the word of the power and wi&s;dom of the eternal Son of God, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who hath revealed him&s;elf in former ages, fir&s;t &s;peaking by the prophets, at &s;undry times and after divers manners, but more clearly by his own appearance, the glorious mani|fe&s;tation of God in the fle&s;h, the great my&s;tery of godline&s;s. For &s;o it is beyond all controver&s;y, God was manife&s;t in the fle&s;h, &s;een of angels, wor&s;hip|ped by them, &s;een of men too, believed on in the world, and received up into glory.</P>
<P>By this manife&s;tation of him&s;elf, he hath brought hidden riches to light, hath brought life and im|mortality to light by the go&s;pel. The trea&s;ures hidden from ages and generations, by the go&s;pel, have been revealed, that life and immortality have been brought to light, which had a being through|out all former ages, and was the ancient object of the &s;aints' faith under the old di&s;pen&s;ation of the covenant of works, who &s;aw but darkly, and as but in a gla&s;s; but it is now more clearly revealed. Thou &s;halt guide me by thy coun&s;el, or by thy wi&s;|dom, and afterwards receive me into glory. To re&s;t in hope even in the holy hope of life and im|mortality. But in the fulne&s;s of time, the rich trea&s;ures of eternity were brought to light, and the veil was taken away from before the face of all na|tions,

<P>Now it is this word of God, this wi&s;dom, that was hid from ages, by which the trea&s;ures of all mankind have been filled, the rich trea&s;ures of all generations, have been repleni&s;hed.

<P>I am &s;en&s;ible there are great numbers of mankind who are unbelievers in the gift of the Holy Gho&s;t.

But where &s;hall we find the learned? We &s;hall find them among&s;t the di&s;ciples of Je&s;us, learned in the &s;chool of experience, who, out of the good trea&s;ure put into their hearts from the ancient Spring of Eternal Riches, are bringing forth things new and old. We &s;hall find them among&s;t the poor of the earth, frequently rich in faith, for, the &s;ecrets of the Almighty are with tho&s;e who fear him; and, the Lion, related in the character of the tribe of Judah, with whom is the key of David, opens the book and unloo&s;es the &s;eals thereof.</P>
<P>I have frequently &s;een tho&s;e among&s;t the low|er cla&s;s of mankind who are the more truly learned; and it appears to me an improper term, to call men learned in the things of God, whil&s;t they are vici|ou&s;ly delighting in iniquity, and are lovers of plea|&s;ure more than followers after him; the&s;e, howe|verlearned, wre&s;t the &s;criptures as unlearned, even to their own de&s;truction.

advantages as others; I am unlearned, I am in ob&s;curity and darkne&s;s, in the nece&s;&s;itous circum|&s;tances of life; and therefore this my &s;ituation is cutting me off from tho&s;e benefits that redound to others, who are in a capacity by acquired know|ledge and experience, to form to them&s;elves encou|raging apprehen&s;ions of the&s;e great things of eternal &s;alvation, and of obtaining a &s;hare in that wi&s;dom which is unchangeable in its nature, and of everla&s;t|ing duration. The word of Eternal Wi&s;dom, when he had taken upon him that body (as in the volume of the book it is written of him) he was conver&s;ant among&s;t the poor, they being the people with whom the Heir of all Things principally de|lighted; for, among&s;t tho&s;e he would have conver|&s;ed with, who were of the chief prie&s;ts and rulers; did ever any of them believe in him? No, for tho&s;e thought them&s;elves wi&s;e, and &s;ought not to know him, the eternal fountain of everla&s;ting joy. Me-thinks I would have all nations to con&s;ider them&s;elves de|&s;igned to have a part in the un&s;peakable wi&s;dom and mercy of God, in the offers of grace, and in the glorious riches of an eternal kingdom, which is prepared for all tho&s;e who &s;incerely love him.

And, in order thereto, that we may know to whom
<PB N="8" REF="037439_0025_100D432671814F30">
we appertain, we are told of the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of the gift of the Holy Gho&s;t, that even they who have not the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t are none of his.</P>
<P>I would again &s;ay, let not a &s;pirit of unbelief, with re&s;pect to this holy gift, enter into the hearts of mankind; for I am bold to a&s;&s;ert, that if the gift of the Holy Gho&s;t be not continued in this day of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that great and glorious light, it is certainly the darke&s;t di&s;pen&s;ation that ever yet was among&s;t mankind: if the &s;acred almighty Fountain of Eternal excellency, does not communicate knowledge, under&s;tanding and wi&s;dom, by his &s;pi|rit, through the word of eternal righteou&s;ne&s;s, the chri&s;tian world is, above all other di&s;pen&s;ations, the darke&s;t and mo&s;t mi&s;erable; for, before the flood, he graciou&s;ly conde&s;cended to conver&s;e with man|kind about the&s;e great truths: he clothed them in their &s;tations with wi&s;dom adapted to their &s;tate, when the iniquity of the people was great and ex|ceedingly offen&s;ive, which cau&s;ed him to pour forth upon the earth a deluge of water, that de&s;troyed them; even previous to that he warned them by his prophets, whom he had made preachers of righteou&s;ne&s;s. And afterwards, when the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah &s;inned, when their cries a&s;cended, in heavy piercing prophanation of the commandment of God, and enter'd into the ears of the great Governor of the World, he held, as it
<PB N="9" REF="037439_0026_100D4328EF637840">
were, a con&s;ultation; and &s;aid, I will go down now, and fee whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it which is come up unto me. He warned them from time to time of the impending danger which threatened them: he re|membered I&s;rael in Egypt, and regarded them in the wilderne&s;s with un&s;peakable kindne&s;s; he gave them the laws upon Mount Sinai with un&s;peakable marks of his own communication and excellency: but, when they tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed again&s;t him, he hewed them by his prophets, and flew them by the words of his mouth; they had the law delivered to them with awful &s;olemnity, and in a manner unque&s;tiona|bly true, to tho&s;e who were appointed for the ap|plication thereof. Moreover he &s;uper&s;eded the law that was written by a new train of his holy &s;er|vants, whom he rai&s;ed and &s;ent forth; what for? To &s;pread the &s;ame and power of religion among&s;t all mankind, and direct them to the great and glo|lious end of their being. And &s;hall we conclude that under the glorious di&s;pen&s;ations of Je&s;us, which hath been ratified and confirmed, not with the blood of bulls or of goats, or with the oblations and &s;acrifices that were only typical, but with the precious blood of the Lamb, "&s;lain from the foundation of the world," that council, wi&s;dom, and heavenly in&s;truction, &s;hould be withheld, or the means of proclaiming afre&s;h, in his go&s;pel, the &s;pirit of life in every creature? I again &s;ay, take
<PB N="10" REF="037439_0027_100D432A84D0D578">
away the gift and exten&s;ion of the Holy Gho&s;t, and we &s;hould be more in ignorance and darkne&s;s than the ages of former di&s;pen&s;ations; but thanks be to him who lives forever, we have ground to believe and to be a&s;&s;ured, that the di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel is a di&s;pen&s;ation of life through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and far &s;uperior in glory to any that ever was before.</P>
<P>This is the new covenant, even his law that he would put in their inward parts, and write in their hearts, and would be their God and they &s;hould be his people; with it he would give them an additi|onal degree of knowledge, acce&s;s to, and commu|nication with, him&s;elf. I do not apprehend it to be a mere enlargement of men's natural powers or rea&s;on, that was the gift of wi&s;dom given to the children of men, through the meritorious atone|ment of Chri&s;t; they had the exerci&s;e of the ration|al faculties; they had a capacity and powers of di&s;cerning con&s;i&s;tent with their &s;tate: their concep|tions and apprehen&s;ions were proportioned to them as the beings of a day; but there &s;eems to be &s;ome|thing of a higher nature requi&s;ite in that &s;tate of light and knowledge, propo&s;ed through the go&s;pel of Je&s;us, which was for the &s;preading that excellent wi&s;dom which is from above, which is fir&s;t pure and peaceable, then gentle and ea&s;y to be intreated;
<PB N="11" REF="037439_0028_100D432DD68438A0">
that wi&s;dom which is divine in it&s;elf in all its pro|perties, and gives them power to inherit &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>We are abundantly told, and it is a truth we can never too much rely upon, that the manife&s;tation of the &s;pirit is given to every man to profit withal; that the gift of the Holy Gho&s;t was proportioned un|to the everla&s;ting eternal intere&s;t of man; and hath been communicated to the various cla&s;&s;es of men's under&s;tandings, that they might be united to him, and learn righteou&s;ne&s;s; that tho&s;e who have wan|dered from the fold of re&s;t, might be brought to Chri&s;t, the everla&s;ting Shepherd and Bi&s;hop of Souls. This is the glory of the go&s;pel of Je&s;us, this is that which makes him excellent through all his attributes, and un&s;peakably glorious throughout his name, "that he came to &s;eek and &s;ave that which was lo&s;t, to bring home that which &s;trayed, to bind up that which hath been broken, and to enlighten tho&s;e who had long &s;at in darkne&s;s, with the glorious brightne&s;s of an everla&s;ting day."</P>

After what manner is the gift of the Holy Gho&s;t given to the children of men? What is its fir&s;t

work, what is the fir&s;t progre&s;s that the Holy Gho&s;t makes? Heaven, earth, &s;ea, and the fountains of water, prompt me to &s;ome degree of experience, and I am qualified to an&s;wer, from faith, in the query; for, I am not among&s;t you without experi|rience, according to my capacity, and I &s;peak forth the things which mine eyes have &s;een and looked upon, not in a tran&s;ient view; but what my hands have handled of the good word and power of eter|nal life, I proclaim among&s;t you. After what manner did the Holy Gho&s;t operate on its fir&s;t ap|pearance among&s;t the children of men? Why, in the &s;ame manner that it did upon the world in the work of the creation, when it was fir&s;t and ori|ginally formed: for at the production of divine power, in the wonderful work of creation, the word was "let there be light" and there was light. He &s;aid, and it was done; he &s;poke and it came to pa&s;s. And, in this go&s;pel day, this glorious di&s;|pen&s;ation of grace and mercy, the word is "let there be light" to enlighten their under&s;tanding to give the knowledge of them&s;elves, that it might &s;hew to us that whatever &s;eeming dignity we may be willing to a&s;&s;ume, whatever mi&s;taken views we have taken of our&s;elves, however comely we may have appeared, in delu&s;ive apprehen&s;ions, yet, in the &s;ight of him who created all things, the people of all nations, and the numberle&s;s ho&s;ts on high, whil&s;t in our natural &s;tates and circum&s;tances, we

are but void and without form; not yet, in&s;tampt with that divine and cele&s;tial image, which is only capable of cele&s;tial glory.</P>
<P>Whatever degrees of under&s;tanding and of natural knowledge; whatever perfection of human wi&s;dom, and experience, and accompli&s;hments of profe&s;&s;ion; O man! O woman! to what length &s;oever thou ha&s;t attained, thou art &s;till the creating work of Eternal Wi&s;dom; he hath furni&s;hed thee with all the&s;e per|fections and powers for a noble purpo&s;e, and hath furni&s;hed thee with a capacity for tho&s;e glorious views of eternity, and the excellent frame that abides for ever. Thou art "without form and void," al|though there may be &s;ome &s;eeming production that may &s;trike thy fancy and flatter &s;elf-love, yet I fear thou art deficient and without form and void. But God &s;aid "let there be light," and there was light; he &s;poke, and it was in&s;tantaneou&s;ly brought forth at his command, and he who effected the great cre|ating work of all things at the beginning, has &s;aid, "let there be light," and there is light throughout the&s;e latter ages, to di&s;cover to mankind their own &s;tate and condition; how it is in the &s;ight of Eternal Purity, who looks, not as man looks, but beholds the hearts of the children of men, with re&s;pect to his &s;acred attributes of knowledge and virtue, as he did at the fir&s;t. "Shall I (&s;ays God) count them pure with the wicked balance, and with the bag of
<PB N="14" REF="037439_0031_100D43350F72BE10">
deceitful weights; and while the veil is over all nations, while gro&s;s darkne&s;s covers their hearts, are they not plea&s;ing them&s;elves with u&s;ing a de|ceitful balance, which, in the end, will be found wanting."</P>
<P>But, "let there be light," to the perfect di&s;cove|ry of their undone &s;tate and condition, in which they appear, in the &s;ight of an awful and righteous Judge, who will "render to every man according to his deeds." Oh, may the light of the morning of the day of the Lord dawn upon your &s;ouls, and ari&s;e higher and higher; may it &s;hine brighter and brighter, till it is finally &s;wallowed up in the bound|le&s;s ocean of everla&s;ting day, where there is no darkne&s;s, no night, no &s;un nor moon, but where is the everla&s;ting habitation of the Lord God and the Lamb, who are the perpetual light of the whole community.</P>
<P>Have not we known a portion of this &s;acred hea|venly light in our own hearts? Yes verily; I dare appeal to the experience of all who have, in any degree, been brought to &s;ee the bitterne&s;s of their own &s;tates, when con&s;cience hath &s;ecretly vi&s;ited them; how often hath it reproved you, how often hath it awfully founded in the ears of thy fir&s;t na|ture, "Adam where art thou?" It was at the fir&s;t interview between our Lord and Adam, when he
<PB N="15" REF="037439_0032_100D4336A9E72470">
called to him, after the defection and departure from that wi&s;dom that covenanted And formed man and all things. The all-wi&s;e Creator did not want to know where his creature Adam was, no, but that his deeds might be made manife&s;t to him by by the light, in order to awake him from in&s;en&s;ibi|lity. O, &s;on of Adam, where art thou? what is thy &s;tate? what is thy circum&s;tance? what is the end of thy being? how is that great and important end kept in view? Thus the que&s;tion has been propo&s;ed to the &s;ons of Adam in this day. Is not the &s;tate in which Adam was, thy own &s;tate? Oh, &s;on of Adam, "where art thou?"</P>
<P>"I heard (&s;ays Adam) thy voice in the garden, and I hid my&s;elf." Oh lamentable change! Oh! the di&s;tance between the creature and the Creator! by whom he was formed in innocency, brought up among&s;t the con&s;tellations of heaven, endued with a capacity for the everla&s;ting contemplation of infinite perfections; placed in paradi&s;e, and ble&s;&s;ed with immortality: but why this di&s;tance? why this fleeing from God? why the &s;acred intercour&s;e interrupted, and the eternal joy gone? His nakedne&s;s was the cau&s;e; &s;hame, ari&s;ing from the guilt of con&s;cience, for the breach of the divine law, drives him from the face of the divine pre&s;ence. Oh, &s;on of Adam, where art thou? "I hid my&s;elf," &s;aid he, guilt had taken hold, "I hid my&s;elf." It is the &s;ame with all

the children of Adam, when the womb of the morn|ing opens upon them, and pre&s;ents to them their own &s;tates, and puts the awful query,&mdash;O &s;on of Adam, where art thou? They are a&s;hamed to own the glorious voice, and, from con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt, with &s;hame, appear before their Almighty father and friend: "I hid my&s;elf;" it was a term never heard of in the innocency of creation. But man fallen into &s;in, a defection and departure from the Lord God en&s;ued, and in&s;tead of living in the pre|&s;ence of the Eternal Creator, he was a&s;hamed and hid him&s;elf.&mdash;O, &s;on of Adam where art thou? And thus the re&s;t of mankind, the progeny of Adam, are the &s;ame in the &s;tate of nature, from one generation to another. They would hide them|&s;elves from the face of that God with whom we have to do, the clear di&s;coveries of the heavenly light is unwelcome to them becau&s;e it brings a degree of horror, letting them &s;ee mi&s;ery on the one hand, and happine&s;s on the other. But it's glorious de&s;cent and operation affords wi&s;dom from day to day, unto tho&s;e whom that God would form to him&s;elf, who always knows what is in man, and what there is to be formed in him to his own image. But ye &s;tum|ble at the light, that &s;acred operation of the divine and heavenly light, the righteou&s;ne&s;s and wi&s;dom of God and Chri&s;t, which is the true light; and are not convinced of your own unrighteou&s;ne&s;s and folly. This was the unhappy &s;tate of Ahab, king
<PB N="17" REF="037439_0034_100D433A858B1910">
of I&s;rael, when he was &s;urrounded with multitudes of prophets, who with flattering &s;ugge&s;tions, &s;poke &s;mooth things to him. They told him he might go and pro&s;per. He approved of their coun&s;el, and their tidings were plea&s;ing: but what they prophe|&s;ied to him were lies; the&s;e wicked ones that he con&s;ulted were very many: but was there no other prophet in I&s;rael? Yes, there was one prophet of the Lord's, that declared truth, to whom God the Father had given the &s;pirit of prophe&s;y; he was capable of being an in&s;trument, in the hand of the Lord, to give to others &s;ound coun&s;el, and not to flatter, as Ahab's four hundred prophets did. This man of God, when he came, declared that the controver&s;y of the Mo&s;t High was again&s;t him: this was di&s;plea&s;ing to Ahab, and when Jeho&s;haphat in|quired after a prophet of the Lord's, he replied "there is yet one, but I hate him; for, he doth not prophe&s;y good things concerning me."</P>
<P>But &s;uch are the good things which the language of wi&s;dom hath &s;poken again&s;t the unwearied whi&s;|perings of the enemy of mankind; and, when the affections are vitiated, and the heavenly reli&s;h lo&s;t, the under&s;tanding, will and judgment, are often a&s;&s;aulted and baffled, by the prince and power of darkne&s;s; and although there are multitudes of ene|mies combining again&s;t us, yet the eternal, un|changeable, and everla&s;ting Wi&s;dom conde&s;cends to

teach, us the &s;olemn truths of his kingdom; and his voice has been like tho&s;e awful awakening claps of thunder in our ears, which formerly &s;hook the top of trembling Sinai. The deceitful coun&s;el, from the fal&s;e prophets' mouths, was believed and obeyed, while the prophet of the Lord, though telling truth was rejected and abhorred. "I hate him" &s;aid Ahab; but notwith&s;tanding this declen&s;i|on, he delivers his me&s;&s;age from God, however contradictory to the inclination of Ahab. But mark the con&s;equence; he ordered them to com|mit him to pri&s;on, and to feed him with the bread of affliction and the water of affliction, till he &s;hould return in peace. Oh, remember the an&s;wer, with trembling, all ye wanton a&s;pirers, who are de&s;pi&s;ing the coun&s;el of God! Remember, the Lord Almigh|ty and his commandments, and tho&s;e by whom he &s;ends, from the fir&s;t morning of creation unto the dawning of the day of eternity; "If thou return at all in peace," (&s;ays the prophet) thou that tram|ple&s;t on the word of God, "the Lord hath not &s;po|ken by me." And it is mo&s;t unque&s;tionably true, and ju&s;tly applicable to tho&s;e who depart from the word of the Lord; they can never return to the truth and inherit peace, unle&s;s they feel and know the divine operation of the &s;pirit of truth in their hearts. For in how tran&s;ient a light doth profe&s;&s;ion appear in the natural man, when no other way has been ca&s;t up for him; and a profe&s;&s;ion, adapted to

<P>I fear there are more who go down to the du&s;t cloathed with the profe&s;&s;ion of religion only, than tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s the life and &s;ub&s;tance of it; of tho&s;e who have only the law in their mouths, than of tho&s;e who have it written in their hearts. And whatever advantages mankind tran&s;gre&s;s again&s;t, whether greater or le&s;s, &s;o will their proportion of reward be. God hath let &s;ome &s;ee their own fatal condition, who would have a good work wrought in them, through their own activity and wi&s;dom. &mdash;I will be religious. I will hear. I will read.

For the paths that lead to ble&s;&s;edne&s;s are &s;till the &s;ame, and the only true chri&s;tian religion is according to the in|ward covenant of grace, which &s;tands not in words, but in power, and in much a&s;&s;urance of the power of the Holy Gho&s;t By this you are guided and di|rected in your way, and by its &s;anctifying virtue, are made like Chri&s;t. Without this, you are only in the exterior courts of the temple, in the outward profe&s;&s;ion of religion only, and in a name to live, when alas! you have been dead; the old nature of the old man &s;till remains, and "the voice is the voice of Jacobs, though the hands are the hands of E&s;au."</P>
<P>Great is this my&s;tery, and unfathomable to the natural mind; it cannot be comprehended but by tho&s;e who have the light which &s;hines from above, the light of eternal wi&s;dom. None but tho&s;e who have this great work begun in them can lay claim to the glorious character of being "children of God," and heirs of the kingdom of light and im|mortality. It is po&s;&s;ible for people to make a lauda|ble profe&s;&s;ion of religion, and not to have come to the &s;aving knowledge of the truth; for, the noble&s;t confe&s;&s;ion with the lips, without a renewed and &s;anctified heart, is ab&s;olutely offen&s;ive to that God with whom we have to do, who "weigheth the mountains in &s;cales and the hills in a balance."

But when the holy light &s;hines forth in the under&s;tanding, and &s;hews them, that their own &s;trength is weakne&s;s, folly and in&s;ufficiency; and they &s;ee &s;in and iniquity exceeding de&s;truc|tive, then they not only &s;ee, but de&s;ire, "to flee from the wrath to come," to be pre&s;erved and kept from the powerful attacks of the prince of darkne&s;s, who has &s;eized multitudes of mankind in the uncleanne&s;s of conver&s;ation. He that fir&s;t &s;ei|zed, with the temptation, in Eden, has again a&s;|&s;aulted, with the &s;ame violence as heretofore, and the mi&s;taken &s;ouls, who by their own workings, think they have made a tran&s;ition from that wretch|ed &s;tate, may perhaps be got farther in the land of infatuation in &s;in and uncleanne&s;s with the fal&s;e prophet.&mdash; "And I beheld three unclean &s;pirits like frogs that came out of the mouth of the bea&s;t, and out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the fal&s;e prophets; the&s;e three unclean &s;pirits are the &s;pirits of the devil, and unto them were &s;eemingly committed the power of working miracles, in imitation of the miraculous power of the Son of God."

<P>It therefore requires the utmo&s;t application of every &s;oul "to add unto their faith virtue, and unto virtue knowledge, and unto knowledge tem|perance, and unto temperance patience, and unto patience godline&s;s, and unto godline&s;s brotherly kindne&s;s, and unto brotherly kindne&s;s charity." I would have no &s;oul to apprehend that I le&s;&s;en, or would le&s;&s;en, purity and holine&s;s of life upon the face of the earth; but that purity and holine&s;s of the heart, might be renewed, and changed into the glorious and heavenly image, by the &s;pirit of God. The law of the ten commandments mu&s;t be ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, obligatory to men, in their &s;piritual &s;tate; and, to us, it is an holy and abundant precept, though, in &s;ome, it is lo&s;t. There is an immedi|ate allu&s;ion to all this &s;hewed forth, by us, as were by the children of I&s;rael, who made to them&s;elves idols, and in&s;cribed upon them the name of God, though it were and is expre&s;sly declared, "thou &s;halt not make unto thy&s;elf any likene&s;s of any thing that is in heaven above or in the earth be|neath, to wor&s;hip it." But we are a&s;&s;ured, that among&s;t the chri&s;tian names there are &s;ome that are making to them&s;elves the likene&s;s of &s;omething in heaven; and this is not known but as we come to

<P>There are &s;ome who are contriving and engraving idols; that are making to them&s;elves an image, or likene&s;s to &s;omething; as faith, hope, and charity, the great and glorious characters engraved on the true chri&s;tians; and glorious riches they are, pecu|liar trea&s;ures, and ine&s;timable pearls, which never fail. Now &s;uch as the&s;e, &s;ome have only made ima|ges of, they have a notion that they call faith which is only opinion in&s;tead of hope; they have &s;ome|thing they call hope, but it is no more than expect|ation; and, in&s;tead of charity, that is of eternal duration, that love which abides for ever; in&s;tead of this excellent grace, they have erected an idol which is nothing but &s;elf-love. The&s;e dead images have taken place, they are, and have been, too much re&s;ting in them in all parts of the chri&s;tian world, and many have made to them&s;elves the&s;e images and likene&s;&s;es to wor&s;hip them, have been bowing down to them of all profe&s;|&s;ions, of all names and di&s;tinctions in the world; and all nations will (unto the final con&s;ummation of terre&s;trial things) continue in this fatal mi&s;taken notion till Chri&s;t enters into their hearts; and then

Chri&s;t the king of glory will give them light, and as the morning &s;tar of eternal day, he will become precious, ever ri&s;ing and &s;hining with cele&s;tial brightne&s;s, till the day be dawned, and "the day|&s;tar ari&s;e in their hearts," to be their light and their lamb for ever.</P>
<P>But, alas! opinion with &s;ome has pa&s;&s;ed for faith; they hear the doctrine and &s;ucce&s;s of the go&s;pel of the holy Je&s;us, and a&s;&s;ent thereto; they believe in notion and confe&s;s with their lips all the truths of the go&s;pel, all his glorious perfections, yet all this may be mere tradition by which the heart is not bettered by the things which are declared; but if to the great truths of the go&s;pel of the holy Je&s;us they can yield the a&s;&s;ent of their judgment, if, by true faith, they receive them, and make them, through divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, their own, not merely flattering them&s;elves with the glorious pro&s;pect of immortali|ty, but are embracing them, by the &s;anctifying &s;pirit that leads to the &s;acred one; then it is by faith we lay hold on Je&s;us and on the&s;e great things of eter|nal life. By faith a glorious conque&s;t is won; by faith we a&s;cend through the various gradations of purity, from victory to victory, and from &s;trength to &s;trengh, till faith gives us the victory over this world and over &s;in, carrying on to the glorious completion of the chri&s;tian warfare, and fitting us for an everla&s;ting union with the triumphant ho&s;t who have overcome the world. This is the faith
<PB N="26" REF="037439_0043_100D4350860DAEC0">
that works by love to the purifying of the heart; but in&s;tead of this faith &s;ome are erecting an image only, and yet are arguing for the verity of it, and and &s;ay it is real and &s;ub&s;tantial, when it is only an opinion; but &s;uch, whatever they &s;ay, whatever they think, they know not that their &s;alvation mu&s;t be wrought out by faith, being &s;trengthened by the &s;pirit of God.</P>
<P>And thus thou&s;ands have been led into idolatry and have created to them&s;elves an image only, when their hearts have not known any thing of faith in Chri&s;t, going on from faith to faith, from &s;trength to &s;trength, and from grace to grace. Oh! it is lamentable to hear &s;pread the mournful tidings of the prevalence of image wor&s;hip, which has &s;educed many from their proper work and bu&s;ine&s;s, to enter them&s;elves on that which will fatally de|ceive them in the end. How lamentably doth David repre&s;ent idolatrous wor&s;thip; "God forbid that I &s;hould offer to the Lord God, or &s;pread among the people, a &s;acrifice of any vile thing" as &s;ome have done, when at the &s;ame time they have had no manner of experience, no inward know|ledge, but the heart hath given the tongue the lie. I fear this is the ca&s;e with many in this profe&s;&s;ing age, and I am convinced that whatever name they bear, if it is not received from heaven, it is no more than opinion that hath pa&s;&s;ed with them for the
<PB N="27" REF="037439_0044_100D435443ADD178">
faith, and the names they bear are like a name un|known. It is certain that there are &s;uch that have plea&s;ed them&s;elves with a profe&s;&s;ion of truth, yet have not witne&s;&s;ed it in their experience. I think they cannot be ju&s;tly compared to the Samaritans, whom the woman called to &s;ee a man that told her all that ever &s;he had done; they believed, and their opinion was founded on the report: there, &s;eemed to be a pretty hone&s;t conviction, yet they were not contented therewith, for the foundation of their faith, till they came and conver&s;ed with him them|selves; then &s;aid they to the woman, "Now we believe, not becau&s;e of thy report, for we have heard him our&s;elves and know that this is indeed the Chri&s;t the Saviour of the world."</P>
<P>Now, my friends, you that pro&s;e&s;s chri&s;tianity, what is the ground of your faith? Is it the report of them that have known whereof they &s;pake? Is it the mere report and te&s;timony of former genera|tions; or have you heard the voice of Chri&s;t, and does he live in you the hope of glory? The holy &s;criptures are an excellent corroborating &s;tream, wherein I can view Chri&s;t, and the compellations of his love, which is of the &s;ame efficacy as in former ages. It is not becau&s;e I have heard tell thereof; but I have felt it, I have drawn nigh to him in the humbling experience of its enlivening motives; and wor&s;hip him, not only as the de&s;ire of former ages,
<PB N="28" REF="037439_0045_100D4355CFD02C08">
but as the pre&s;ent glory of his people. I can be|lieve in him as my God, my hope, my help, my heavenly father and friend, and the con&s;tant com|panion of my ways through the wilderne&s;s of this world.</P>
<P>Here is the ground of faith, the living &s;aving faith, in which the righteous are e&s;tabli&s;hed, built up, and comfortably edifyed for the everla&s;ting kingdom; in the living knowledge of what he is now to them, and in the divine a&s;&s;urance of what he will be, when all ages and generations &s;hall be &s;wallowed up in the eternal day, when they will, by advancing from one progre&s;&s;ion to another, lay hold on eternal glory, and can &s;ay, in the &s;olemn language of the apo&s;tles, "We are not come to the mount that might be touched and that burned with fire and brim&s;tone, nor unto blackne&s;s, and darkne&s;s, and tempe&s;t, nor unto the &s;ound of the trumpet, and the voice of words, which voice was &s;o terrible that tho&s;e who heard entreated that the word &s;hould not be &s;poken to them any more; &s;o terrible was the &s;ight, that Mo&s;es &s;aid, I exceed|ingly quake and fear: "but we are come," by the excerci&s;e of divine faith, "unto Mount Sion," unto the holy city of the living God, and to the boundle&s;s fruition of un&s;peakable joy; we are come "to the new Jeru&s;alem, to the general a&s;&s;embly, and church of the fir&s;t born, and to the &s;pirits of
<PB N="29" REF="037439_0046_100D435828F4C978">
ju&s;t men made perfect," and all the united conflu|ence of the angelic ho&s;t. O ble&s;&s;ed are they who are fitted for that excellent and glorious habitation, where the &s;ons of wi&s;dom have eternal abode.</P>
<P>This appears to have been the joyful experience of the primitive chri&s;tian believers. Their faith laid hold on, and, by their experience, they knew that they were come to Mount Sion. They had that trea&s;ure in earthen ve&s;&s;els, the excellency whereof was not of man, but God; and as the na|tive de&s;cendants of that illu&s;trious and royal race, they knew, from a degree of divine a&s;&s;urance, that they abode in him, and when their earthly taberna|cle was di&s;&s;olved, and the immortal inhabitant di&s;lodged from its fabrick of clay, that a building of God was prepared for them, "an hou&s;e not made with hands, but eternal in the heavens;" and to|wards this excellent and glorious abode they pre&s;&s;ed forward.</P>
<P>Now mere opinion cannot lay claim to the&s;e great and excellent promi&s;es; I will tell you how far it will reach; it reaches often too far, and exhi|bits a mi&s;taken pro&s;pect to the deluded minds; they are de&s;irous after happine&s;s, but their de&s;ires are founded on &s;elf-love. "Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my latter end be like unto his;" let my habitation be in the land of eternal quietude.
<PB N="30" REF="037439_0047_100D435A83A5C6E0">If this is only the language of &s;elf-love, they who &s;peak it, ever delight in that which is evil, and flee that which is painful to nature, and &s;hun the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t. They can de&s;ire after heaven, let my habitation be in the land of eternal quietude; but let them remember that fle&s;h and blood can never enter the kingdom of God. Thus they have been brought to farther mi&s;takes re&s;pecting their conditi|on; they have mi&s;taken their de&s;ires to be heavenly, out whil&s;t their de&s;ires were after heaven, they have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the corruptions of their nature, and have been e&s;tabli&s;hed in no manner of meetne&s;s for the inheritance of his &s;aints in the light, for the glorious fellow&s;hip of the ble&s;&s;ed above. They think they are well on their way to the kingdom of God; but oh, that they may open their eyes before they are clo&s;ed to the world, and their immortal &s;pirits entered into the confines of a boundle&s;s eter|nity. Oh; that they may &s;ee that their minds are an&s;anctified, and that their hearts mu&s;t be created anew in righteou&s;ne&s;s and true holine&s;s, before they can be clothed with the garment and brightne&s;s of the Lamb. They de&s;ire it may be well with them; opinion can lead to this; but it is faith that can purify the heart; this faith is effectual, it works by love, it has a happy operation on their lives, it kin|dles heavenly de&s;ires, opens a fountain of purity and &s;anctification to the &s;oul, from which fountain ari|&s;es and flows forth every excellent &s;tream. Oh that ye might be brought into this holy heavenly frame
<PB N="31" REF="037439_0048_100D435C0E083578">
of &s;pirit. Here you can have living de&s;ires after heaven and happine&s;s, not merely an exemption from trouble, &s;orrow, pain, unea&s;ine&s;s, and vexation; but a place of happine&s;s, a land of con&s;ummate purity, of peaceful and cele&s;tial re&s;t.</P>
<P>Can opinion avail it&s;elf by de&s;ires and expectati|ons? No, has not expectation pa&s;t for hope as well as opinion pa&s;t for faith? Yes, all flatter them&s;elves with a hope in Chri&s;t in an awful approaching mo|ment; but let me &s;ay, it is a truth that is eternal in its duration, and will abide forever, that no ex|pectation that is built upon mere opinion, will ever bring us to everla&s;ting glory. There may be an expectation, that is, a pa&s;&s;ion of the mind, that ari&s;es after &s;ome object to which it has no immedi|ate relation or fitne&s;s, but is in degree intercepted, and thus they deceive them&s;elves; for the mind being unrenewed, there is not a po&s;&s;ibility of the true hope being admitted, and that which they call hope is but a mere empty expectation, that will fatally deceive them; at the la&s;t day we mu&s;t be made &s;en&s;ible of the worth of, and be made meet and fit for, the object of hope &s;et before us, before ever we can receive that "hope which is an anchor to the &s;oul, and keeps it &s;ure and &s;tedfa&s;t" amid&s;t the tempe&s;tuous commotions of an uncertain world. This keeps the &s;oul in heavenly relation to the fa|ther of &s;pirits, and gives it an admittance into the
<PB N="32" REF="037439_0049_100D435FD0EFBD38">
holy my&s;teries that are within the veil. That glo|rious God who created all things out of nothing, can by that power which made us in his likene&s;s, tran&s;|late us from death and darkne&s;s into the kingdom of his marvellous light, the glorious gates &s;tand open night and day, yet there is nothing unclean, un|&s;anctified, or impure; "nothing that worketh an abomination or maketh a lye," &s;hall ever enter.</P>
<P>Let us attend to the operation of hope, among&s;t the primitive believers, and try whether the pa&s;&s;ion of the mind, which we call hope, be attended with the &s;ame happy effect as theirs; "what manner of love is this (&s;aid they) wherewith the heavenly fa|ther hath loved us, that we &s;hould be called the &s;ons of God? They readily owned they knew not what they &s;hould be when clothed with immortality, or in what &s;phere of cele&s;tial glory they were to move.</P>
<P>"We know not what we &s;hall be (&s;aid they) with re&s;pect to the re&s;urrection of the body; but this we know, that when Chri&s;t appears, we &s;hall be like him as he is." Whence proceeds this knowledge, but from the happy te&s;timony of a holy conformity to his life. This was the happy effect of this excel|lent hope, and "he that hath this hope in Chri&s;t purifieth him&s;elf even as he is pure." He that hath this hope in Chri&s;t, this glorious hope, has the immortal riches, the enduring trea&s;ure, that was hid from former generations, even "Chri&s;t in
<PB N="33" REF="037439_0050_100D436196F97458">
them the" &s;ole "hope of eternal glory." He that hath this hope keepeth him&s;elf pure, for he knows the habitation of peace and purity, is the habitation of them that are &s;anctified.</P>
<P>This is the nature and con&s;titution of hope, it is lead by an eye of faith: faith looks on and a&s;&s;ents to; and hope, with the hand, lays hold and fa&s;tens on the prize. He that hath this hope in Chri&s;t purifieth him&s;elf even as he is pure, according to his degrees of &s;trength and knowledge; for he knows that holi|ne&s;s is in&s;cribed on every &s;anctified ve&s;&s;el in the Lord's hou&s;e, and that nothing which is unholy can ever enter there. For the Lord &s;hall be unto them an everla&s;ting light, and their God their glory. And charity, that love of God, which remains when faith and hope will be &s;wallowed up in the hea|venly vi&s;ion, and complete fruitions of the divinely excellent and glorious object; this charity, that is divinely pure, has been counterfeited with an image of &s;elf-love, which has been made among&s;t the children of men, and &s;et up in opinions. "I am of Paul, I am of Apollos," I am of this or the other party, of this or the other name and di&s;tincti|on: thus hath this image been erected and wor&s;hip|ped, in&s;tead of the divine charity that abides for ever, that keeps the heart pure and clean, and e&s;ta|bli&s;hes it upon a glorious and unchangeable object. They have been centering them&s;elves in their own
<PB N="34" REF="037439_0051_100D4365DBC4A098">
narrow conceptions, feeking their own things, and not the things of Chri&s;t; thus, neglecting the great things of their eternal happine&s;s, they have &s;ound them&s;elves empty, void, and without form, The&s;e drink and yet are thir&s;ty, they eat and are not &s;atis|fied, and are heaping up their trea&s;ure in unfound bags that will not hold it. They are making a profe&s;&s;ion of Religion, without the life and &s;ub&s;tance of it; they dream of much, but lo it will come to little; and, with re&s;pect to the great things of &s;al|vation, will be unprofitable, and their wor&s;hip is an untimely fruit in the &s;ight of the great and ado|rable Maje&s;ty on high.</P>
<P>May the law of the Lord enter into your hearts, to convince you of &s;in, of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and of judgment to come, that you may &s;ee your &s;tate, while the day of ble&s;&s;ed vi&s;itation remains; &s;ee the various circum&s;tances of your condition, and in what manner of meetne&s;s you are for the ble&s;&s;ed inheritance of life eternal.

I thought I had been comely, when I viewed my&s;elf, and was dignifying my&s;elf with the &s;canty garments of an outward profe&s;&s;ion: but look not upon me. O daughter of Jeru&s;alem, for I am black; I now be|hold my deformity and di&s;agreeablene&s;s to un&s;potted and infinite Purity. Oh! wretched man that I am, who &s;hall deliver me from the dreadful wrath to come.</P>
<P>This is the &s;olemn language of all fle&s;h, when they are favoured to &s;ee them&s;elves in the light of their God; but there are &s;ome among you that have made to your&s;elves images of faith, hope, and cha|rity, and ye wor&s;hip the erection on the plains of Babel, and are falling down to wor&s;hip the&s;e dead images of religion. In the plains of Babel, and in the land of confu&s;ion, are the mi&s;taken multitude a&s;&s;embling together, to offer wor&s;hip to the various
<PB N="37" REF="037439_0054_100D436D31744740">
images they have formed, and happy are tho&s;e who know the veil to be rent, and the holy &s;pirit to en|lighten their under&s;tandings, and that the&s;e images are broken to du&s;t by the breath and power of the eternal &s;pirit of God.</P>
<P>How often may we remark per&s;ons making u&s;e of the forms and words of another's prayer, and per|haps the experience of another, that is quite foreign to their own, or, in their addre&s;&s;es to God, have been forming and fa&s;hioning their wor&s;hip in pecu|liar manners that are not their own; and thus they are offering to the Lord of ho&s;ts, a &s;acrifice that hath not only co&s;t them nothing, but is, at the &s;ame time a "lye in their right hands." They can approach his holine&s;s and take his &s;acred and ado|rable name in vain, without difficulty. The&s;e are &s;uch things as I cannot be reconciled to; and, how often may we hear people expre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves in language of &s;cripture, accented to wor&s;hip, in that which it has no manner of relation to. I have heard per&s;ons that are vile &s;ay or &s;ing (as if they had a right to u&s;e the language of &s;cripture) "rivers of tears run down my eyes becau&s;e men keep not thy law." I have heard per&s;ons that are vile &s;ay, "I hate the workers of iniquity," when the glorious work of righteou&s;ne&s;s is not the de&s;ire of their hearts, but only the experience of another. When they approach the dread Maje&s;ty, thus they mock
<PB N="38" REF="037439_0055_100D436F80526D90">
him, and thus di&s;cover the mark of mi&s;taken wor&s;hip and the indubitable mark of the bea&s;t is in their foreheads. I have heard others &s;ay or &s;ing, as the "hunted hart panteth after the water brook, &s;o panteth my &s;oul after thee O God;" when it is no|thing more than what &s;uch impo&s;e upon God for wor&s;hip, when, alas! there has been no manner of truth in it at the heart, nothing but an expre&s;&s;ion which they have vainly taken into their mouths.</P>
<P>Oh the abominable pre&s;umption of men, that they &s;hould thus &s;trive to deceive the all-&s;eeing eye of the Dread of Nations, and appear before God with a lye in their right-hand. Oh! that man, who&s;e breath is in his no&s;trils, &s;hould thus mock the Almighty ruler of heaven and earth! They are creating an image in the plain of Babel, and are falling down to wor&s;hip it; they are wor&s;hipping with their heads and their tongues, whil&s;t their hearts are far from him; they have &s;poken other men's words, and have been led on to idolatry till they are become a dead &s;ub&s;tance. True wor&s;hip would clothe mankind with reverence, it would rai&s;e an awful petition for deliverance and &s;alvation, were they convinced in them&s;elves, that the Lord beholds them, and that they are weighed in the balance of the &s;anctuary and are found wanting; and when they have &s;een them&s;elves as in the vi&s;ion lo&s;t; then they cry out, "Oh wretched man that I am!&mdash;Lord

&s;ave me, I peri&s;h!&mdash;&s;end forth thy help, or I &s;ink! if I have not thy help, I am undone."</P>
<P>If we are truly awakened we &s;hall find arguments to addre&s;s the great Parent of mankind; and it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary we &s;hould cry to him for help and pre&s;erva|tion. If a child wants bread, it will cry to its parent for relief; and, in this &s;imilitude, I mean to &s;pread greater things before you by &s;maller ones, and to direct your &s;olemn cries to the Univer&s;al Parent and Friend. I pay a peculiar regard to &s;uch motives as may excite and awaken tender compa&s;&s;ion in men towards them&s;elves: their con&s;ciences &s;hould be their own monitor, &mdash;that which would move them to call for relief&mdash;they that walk in the light are the &s;ons of light and of day&mdash;they have a language that enters the ears of the Lord of Sabbath,&mdash;in their fee|ble cries they look towards the glorious habitations of his holine&s;s, with awful reverence; and the &s;preading of their cau&s;e before Chri&s;t is in the em|phatical language of the heart, and in a flow of tears do they pour forth their prayers at the throne of Sacred Wi&s;dom; and there is no true prayer &s;o ac|ceptable to Chri&s;t as that which proceeds from the humble and awakened heart; if it is but a &s;igh, an intelligible &s;igh, it is &s;ufficient; it is more divine and acceptable to the everla&s;ting Father than all the words and expre&s;&s;ions in the world.</P>

<HEAD>The following SERMON was delivered, on First|day morning the 17th day of the Fifth month 1767, at the <HI>opening</HI> of the yearly-meeting, at the Fryers, in Bristol.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. xx. 9.</NOTE> <HI>Art thou in health; my brother?</HI></P>
<P>IT hath been in my mind to adopt the language or &s;alutation of Joab to Ama&s;a; but with &s;enti|ments different, far different, from tho&s;e which actuated the treachery of Joab; even tho&s;e of true and tender affection, and with a mind repleni&s;hed with that charity, which wi&s;heth well to all.</P>
<P><HI>Art thou in health; my brother?</HI></P>
<P>I could wi&s;h, with all po&s;&s;ible &s;olicitude, to lead every mind pre&s;ent, into the mo&s;t careful enquiry, in re&s;pect to their &s;piritual &s;tate of health; and to their immediate relation, and affinity, to that &s;u|preme almighty Being, who is the ju&s;t and awful Judge of quick and dead. I fear it hath proceeded from too anxious a &s;olicitude for the health of your bodies, and pro&s;perity of your temporal concerns, that too many of you have too frequently, and in a
<PB N="41" REF="037439_0058_100D437646CDED98">
manner totally, neglected the great concern of your immortal &s;ouls; which is indeed <HI>the one thing need|ful.</HI></P>
<P>Tho&s;e temporal concerns, I &s;ay, which are of a trifling peri&s;hing nature, have, I fear! interrupted and taken off from this principal concern: your anxiety and application towards the attainment of the trea&s;ures and the enjoyment of the plea&s;ures of the world, have occa&s;ioned too great a neglect of your religious duty.</P>
<P>The conveniencies of life are, by no means, a contemptible concern, where they are bounded with temperance, and confined within their proper chan|nel: but as there is a part in us of infinitely greater, of no le&s;s than eternal moment; it al&s;o requires an attention proportionable to it's proper worth; for what are temporal concerns when compared with the important one of eternity!</P>
<P>The &s;tate of the body is &s;ubject to divers mala|dies; and when we have done our utmo&s;t to pre|&s;erve it, we &s;hall find in the end (and how &s;oon that may be none knows) that it is of nece&s;&s;ity, &s;ubject to the &s;troke of death, and to the enclo&s;ure of the grave.</P>
<P>I have therefore thought it by no means an im|proper enquiry for each individual to make, and
<PB N="42" REF="037439_0059_100D437A169FC750">
deeply ponder, What is thy &s;tate, or how is it with thee, O my &s;oul? who art capable of partaking of immortal joys! and de&s;igned, to triumph over death and the grave, <HI>When this earthly tabernacle shall be dissolved,</HI> thy appointment and de&s;tination, if in proper &s;oundne&s;s for it, &s;hall be made perfect with the whole family of GOD, and be no lon|ger &s;ubject to the di&s;ea&s;es, pains, trials and afflicti|ons of this life, but &s;hare the things which are of GOD, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. xii. 23.</NOTE> <HI>With the general assembly and church of the first-born, whose names are written in heaven.</HI></P>
<P>As this is of the mo&s;t infinite importance to the &s;ons of men, I have thought it my particular duty, upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, to put you in mind of the nece&s;&s;ary enquiry into the &s;tate of your &s;piritual health; the condition of your immortal &s;ouls: be|ing very apprehen&s;ive that all of you, my brethren, are not in perfect health, who have outwardly the appearance of health; but that, on the contrary, many are in a dangerous &s;tate of di&s;ea&s;e and &s;tupe|faction; have only pre&s;erved a lethargic frame, and are tottering upon the brink of de&s;truction.</P>
<P>This enquiry into the pre&s;ent &s;tate of experience, and of advancement in the work of &s;alvation, hath branched it&s;elf out in my view, and divided into
<PB N="43" REF="037439_0060_100D437C6499DF80">
&s;everal cla&s;&s;es, tho&s;e who are now within the au|dience of my voice. And in the fir&s;t place, I en|treat the attention of you, the elders, among&s;t whom our LORD, as among&s;t &s;o many &s;hepherds, hath divided his flock; over whom you are appoint|ed to watch, and to teach them to per&s;evere in the path which leadeth to eternal life?</P>
<P>You have experienced the power of religion: you have <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiii. 12.</NOTE> <HI>put on the armour of light;</HI> and ought to &s;tand as guardian angels, and to call as the angel called, &s;aying, <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rev. xxi. 9.</NOTE> <HI>Come up hither, and I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb's wife.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Are you in health,</HI> my brethren, <HI>Are you in health,</HI> my &s;i&s;ters?&mdash;<HI>Are you in health,</HI> my fellow labour|ed in the LORD? &mdash;Are you in a lively active &s;tate in the cau&s;e of religion? in the cau&s;e of virtue and temperance? in the power of the go&s;pel, as it is in CHRIST?</P>
<P>If tho&s;e that have been called with an high and holy calling, as delegated &s;hepherds under the one great &s;hepherd, walk uprightly in his fear and to his glory; then the &s;heep will with them be more likely to be gained upon to follow the great Shep|herd; they will then have a frequent de&s;ire, a long|ing

appetite after the divine Manna, which cometh down from GOD out of Heaven: for every life hath its food and its proper nutriment; and a &s;oul panting after heaven can be &s;atisfied with nothing &s;hort of the <HI>food</HI> from heaven.</P>
<P>In the next place, I addre&s;s <HI>you,</HI> my brethren in the work of the mini&s;try, reminding you of its divine in&s;titution, all that have entered rightly into it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. v. 4.</NOTE> <HI>being called of God, as was Aaron.</HI></P>

He will make you, if with due con&s;tancy ye adhere to, and attend on him, a &s;acred and fixed flame of love, and of light never to be extingui&s;hed: your care, and pains, and labour here will be but a moment, your reward will be <HI>a crown of life ever|lasting.</HI>

The bread that you eat, and the water that you drink, and of which ye mini&s;ter a due &s;hare to others, will be daily &s;pringing up in you unto everla&s;ting life!

<P>Indeed it hath &s;ometimes happened that &s;ome of the mini&s;ters of CHRIST, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. iv. 1, 2.</NOTE> <HI>stewards of the mystery of God,</HI> have not been &s;ound faithful to what he required.

<P><HI>But I hope better things of you,</HI> beloved in CHRIST, <HI>and things that accompany salvation.</HI> I am &s;ure we have need, with the utmo&s;t diligence, application, and care, to keep the loins of our minds girded about: we had need to &s;tand upon the watch: we have great need to maintain the utmo&s;t &s;teadi|ne&s;s:

<P><HI>Are you in health, my brethren?</HI> are you &s;trongly attached to the promotion and exhaltation of that glorious cau&s;e which you have embarked in? have each of you a &s;hare in, and a proper care of the LORD'S work?

<P>I freely confe&s;s my own &s;ears, that I am not in a &s;tate of perfect health and &s;ound mind; labouring as I ought in the work of the LORD. As it is a ta&s;k of the utmo&s;t importance, I ought to remain ever diffident of my own care, and to watch daily in the di&s;charge of a tru&s;t &s;o great and important as that of the recovery and pre&s;ervation <HI>of the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</HI></P>

&s;ufficiently di&s;charged, the &s;ecret cry of my &s;oul has, after this manner, frequently ari&s;en, "LORD! &s;pare thy people and ble&s;s thine heritage."

<P>I come now to another cla&s;s, whom I mean to addre&s;s under the title of tho&s;e within the audience of my voice, who continue in a &s;ingle &s;tate.</P>
<P><HI>Are you in health my brethren and sisters?</HI> are you po&s;&s;e&s;t of inward virtue, and of ability to live to GOD, as becometh his &s;aints; and which alone will lead you to eternal life: do you a&s;pire after the&s;e, with an unabated zeal?</P>
<P>You mu&s;t not expect always to re&s;t &s;atisfied with the good things of this life.

For as, on the one hand, minds infected and vitiated <HI>with the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, or the pride of life,</HI> are very apt to &s;pread the contagion to all that are round about them: &s;o, on the other hand, &s;uch as are re&s;tored by Chri&s;t, to a &s;tate of &s;piritual health, and by him &s;teadily pre&s;erved in it, often become in&s;trumental in his hand, to diffu&s;e that ble&s;&s;ing; from whence, healthy parents have been frequently ob&s;erved to have healthy chil|dren.</P>
<P>I am convinced that the Lord is at work among&s;t the ri&s;ing generation; many of whom &s;tand convict|ed in their own minds, of the want of &s;piritual health; and are imploring the mercy of the God of their &s;alvation.</P>
<P>In order to your attaining it, let me call upon you again, the pre&s;ent ri&s;ing generation; who&s;e &s;tations in life may be likely to have &s;ome little con|tinuance; be ever &s;tedfa&s;t in the performance of

your religious duties, that you may become heirs of the kingdom; and have your portion, with the children of God.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to me of the greate&s;t importance, in re|lation to the various affairs of life, to form aright the minds of youth; and therefore, I once more entreat every parent pre&s;ent, that you watch over, and carefully nouri&s;h every &s;eed of virtue &s;pringing up in the minds of your children, for the &s;ake of their, and of your own, temporal welfare; as well as for the hope and a&s;&s;urance of both their, and your own, eternal happine&s;s.</P>
<P>And here, let me cla&s;s every &s;ingle individual; as every &s;ingle individual is po&s;ting on his way to an eternal &s;tate of exi&s;tence&mdash;and that they may be guided by infinite wi&s;dom, is my earne&s;t de&s;ire; and be at la&s;t received into glory! welcomed thi|ther by their dear Redeemer!</P>
<P>In this city he hath laid his hand upon one, and upon another. He hath pre&s;erved many from the pollutions that too frequently reign in the world; and hath mercifully induced &s;ome to look early into the law of liberty, into the coun&s;el of his will, who thereby learn the things which belong to their peace.</P>

<P>I believe it may be &s;aid concerning &s;ome among you, as was &s;aid formerly to Chri&s;t; <HI>Lord, he whom thou lovest is sick.</HI> The decay of health in many, has been owing to foul feeding; to their daily feeding upon the &s;pirit, maxims and manners of the world, upon exterior appearances, upon comparitive righteou&s;ne&s;s, upon a compari&s;on of their pre&s;ent, with their for|mer &s;tate; who&s;e minds are relaxed with the love and &s;pirit of vanity. Some have relaxed into evil, and are now become too much unacquainted with God and his law; which, to holine&s;s, and to that only, annexes happine&s;s. Many of the&s;e might have gone on from one degree of &s;trength to ano|ther; had they not too much regarded the things of time, and fed too greedily upon the temptations and plea&s;ures of this life; not enough con&s;idering, that the di&s;ea&s;es and di&s;orders of the mind thus fed, mu&s;t certainly at la&s;t bring death, even the <HI>death,</HI> tho' not <HI>dissolution,</HI> of the &s;oul.

<P>I be&s;eech you, continue in your love to the go&s;|pel of Chri&s;t: that, day after day, you may feed on the holy &s;acrifice, and on that eternal fruit with which he nouri&s;hes the &s;oul that hungers and thir&s;ts after righteou&s;ne&s;s.

<P>HAVING in the morning enlarged on our debts or obligations to God, for the abundant variety of temporal ble&s;&s;ings received from him in tru&s;t, for the good of others, &amp;c, he proceeded thus:</P>
<P>"If we are be&s;ides our&s;elves, it is unto God: If we are &s;ober, it is for your &s;akes <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. v. 13.</NOTE>." If, with the &s;trength of love, and a zealous fervency of mind, we labour in and for the church, and for the good of tho&s;e to whom we are &s;ent; if ri&s;ing early and lying down late; if being willing to &s;pend and to be &s;pent, di&s;intere&s;tedly, without any lucrative motive,
<PB N="58" REF="037439_0075_100D439BE4751588">
or receiving any thing but mere food, from tho&s;e among&s;t whom we labour; if mini&s;tring to our own wants, and to the wants of others, carry any kind of evidence to the con&s;iderate and prudent mind, of a di&s;intere&s;ted go&s;pel mini&s;try; we have, &s;o far, a valid claim to it.</P>
<P>"We preach not our&s;elves, but Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Lord; and our&s;elves your &s;ervants, for his &s;ake <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. iv. 5&mdash;</NOTE>."</P>
<P>"If we are be&s;ides our&s;elves, it is unto God, If we are &s;ober, it is for your &s;akes. Having known the terrors of the Lord for &s;in;" having experien|ced a gradual progre&s;&s;ion from the pit of pollution, from the mire and clay; "having," in &s;ome mea|&s;ure, "ta&s;ted of the good word of life, and of the powers of the world to come," we apprehend we have authority, more than any human laws or ordi|nation of men can give us, to tell to others, what God hath done for our &s;ouls. I may proceed yet further with truth and &s;incerity, having the &s;anction of him, who is the &s;earcher of hearts; "for the love of Chri&s;t con&s;traineth us <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. v. 14.&mdash;</NOTE>." The foundation of the go&s;pel mini&s;try is this con&s;training love of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>We enter not into the mini&s;terial office, with any application of this &s;ort, viz. "Put me (I pray thee) into one of the prie&s;ts offices, that I may eat a piece of bread <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. ii. 36.</NOTE>." We think
<PB N="59" REF="037439_0076_100D439DF823A4A0">
higher of the go&s;pel mini&s;try; &s;o that no tem|porary emolument can po&s;&s;ibly be an adequate in|ducement to us, to enter upon it; for "the love of Chri&s;t con&s;traineth us." We &s;peak with reverence and a feeling heart; and we believe the chri&s;tian religion will never flouri&s;h, in its full perfection and excellency, till their being thus con&s;trained, be|comes the ca&s;e of all that take the name of God in their mouths in a public manner."The love of Chri&s;t con&s;traineth us; becau&s;e we thus judge that if one died for all, then were all dead. And that he died for all, that they which live, &s;hould not henceforth live to them&s;elves, but to him that died for them and ro&s;e again <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. v. 14.&mdash;</NOTE>."</P>
<P>This expre&s;&s;ion &s;eems to me, if properly con&s;ider|ed, to ca&s;t no incon&s;iderable light upon the proprie|ty of that query applied to us, viz. "How much owe&s;t thou unto my Lord?" which I cannot yet re|linqui&s;h; though &s;ome may think I dwell upon it too long. "The love of Chri&s;t con&s;traineth us, be|cau&s;e if one died for all, then were all dead." I look upon this as a fundamental part of the Chri&s;ti|an faith; "and that life and immortality" have been "brought to light by the go&s;pel." We were all dead; we have all partaken of guilt; we have all been in a &s;tate of en&s;trangement from the covenant of God; we have all become, more or le&s;s, "aliens to the commonwealth of I&s;rael <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eph. ii. 12.</NOTE>."</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="037439_0077_100D43A02D0E2630">In this &s;tate of death, the voice of God hath been &s;ignally extended unto mankind. I have &s;ometimes con&s;idered with great attention, his declaration, "O! death, I will be thy plagues <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ho&s;. xiii. 14.&mdash;</NOTE>;" and it hath made a deep impre&s;&s;ion upon my mind. This de|claration of the mo&s;t high God hath been amply ve|rified in the experience of all who have been quick|ened into a life of piety. "Chri&s;t" hath been "the re&s;urrection and the life" to all &s;uch. Though "death" hath "come upon all," we are not all in|cluded under death; &s;o as to be left without the quickening vivifying power that is offered to rai&s;e the dead to life.</P>
<P>"The dead have heard the voice of the Son of God <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John v. 25.&mdash;</NOTE>!" and have been rai&s;ed again to life. I can|not think but it has been the experience of divers, within the audience of my voice, who know the certainty of this important truth though others may reflect upon me, as being be&s;ide my&s;elf; yet, if &s;o, I may &s;ay with the apo&s;tle, "it is unto God." But I would gladly &s;peak intelligibly to the &s;oul that is on its way to the regions of immortality; for, if we are &s;ober, "it is for your &s;akes." I would a&s;k whe|ther a &s;ecret &s;omething hath not often vi&s;ited your &s;ouls, an un&s;peakable &s;omething, often &s;ecretly and immediately attended, that hath engaged you to &s;end up heavenly and earne&s;t wi&s;hes, and rai&s;ed in
<PB N="61" REF="037439_0078_100D43A2567680E8">
your minds &s;trong a&s;pirations, or breathings, after God? when we are told that "the whole creation groaneth together in bondage until now <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 21, 22.&mdash;</NOTE>," we have no doubt of its being relative and applicable to the pre&s;ent times, or &s;uch times of longing after God, to be delivered by him. "The Lord from heaven is the quickening &s;pirit <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xv. 45 47.&mdash;</NOTE>." An expre&s;&s;ion of want, from a real &s;en&s;e of it, is an evidence of life; or be|ing rai&s;ed by him from a &s;tate of death. We have not been left in a dead &s;tate! this prediction hath been verified, "O! death, I will be thy plagues," He hath brought the fir&s;t evidence of life, which is a &s;en&s;e of want. The &s;piritually dead have received it; and it hath been of his pure mercy, that he hath followed us from time to time, hath met us, as it were, in a narrow place, with in&s;tructions and reproofs, and &s;ecretly rai&s;ed in us the hidden life of his own divine wi&s;dom; he hath cau&s;ed the anima|ting and warming beams of the &s;un of righteou&s;ne&s;s to break forth. And, yet more, the word which called Lazarus out of the grave, hath already, in a good degree, rai&s;ed &s;ome of us to life, even life eternal? "death is &s;wallowed up in victory <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xv. 54.</NOTE>"</P>
<P>And therefore "the love of Chri&s;t con&s;traineth us," becau&s;e he hath proved "the plagues of our death," He not only died, but the immediate ma|nife&s;tation
<PB N="62" REF="037439_0079_100D43A51543CD48">
of his quickening &s;pirit hath led "capti|vity captive," that we, by him, may triumph over the united powers of darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>We follow not formally; but we believe in, and are convinced, fully convinced, of the doctrines of the chri&s;tian religion, the incarnation, glory, life, death, mighty miracles, and various circum&s;tances relative to the holy life of Je&s;us, "as in the volume of the book it is written <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah liii. 7.&mdash;</NOTE>;" and can, in an awful and reverent &s;en&s;e, commemorate, tho&s;e va&s;t and mo&s;t intere&s;ting events.</P>
<P>We admire, with humble hearts and minds, the awful tran&s;actions of that time, when &s;weat, like drops of blood, ran from the face of the holy Je|&s;us! when, being in agony, he prayed more earne&s;t|ly! when he was betrayed! his &s;acred head crown|ed with thorns! his, face &s;pit upon! he was mo&s;t ig|nominiou&s;ly treated, and as "a &s;heep before her &s;hearers is dumb <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm xi. 7.</NOTE>," he complained not.</P>
<P>We behold him, in his agonies on Calvary Mount, offering him&s;elf as a &s;acrifice for the &s;ins of the whole world; that he might purify us, by the &s;hedding of his precious blood! "more precious than the blood of goats and lambs;" or any other that was &s;hed under the law. We believe in his
<PB N="63" REF="037439_0080_100D43A74BCC7260">
amazing mercy, in offering him&s;elf there; when, loaden with the immen&s;e weight of the &s;ins of man|kind, and the immediate &s;en&s;e of the Father's pre&s;ence withdrawn, he was left to &s;uffer alone; un|der this extreme pre&s;&s;ure crying out, "Eloi, Eloi, lama Sabacthani!" was crucified! dead! and buried.</P>
<P>Here pau&s;e a little, I be&s;eech you!&mdash;contemplate the adorable theme! acknowledge, O man! that unbounded gratitude which is ever due from thee: O! my &s;oul, "how much owe&s;t thou unto thy Lord!"</P>
<P>I know we have been &s;tigmatized, as di&s;believing the truths of the chri&s;tian religion. However, I call the divine record, the Saviour of the world, that was offered a &s;acrifice without the gate of Jeru|&s;alem, to witne&s;s for my belief, that he was &s;ent from GOD, to do the "Father's will;" and I do, without controver&s;y, believe that he was "GOD manife&s;t in the fle&s;h, ju&s;tified in the &s;pirit, believed on in the world, and received up into glory <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iii. 16.&mdash;</NOTE>." We do not at all doubt that God was "in Chri&s;t recon|ciling the world unto him&s;elf <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor, v. 10.</NOTE>. That Chri&s;t gave
<PB N="64" REF="037439_0081_100D43A8D52E8FC8">
him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all, to be te&s;tified in due time <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. ii. 6.&mdash;</NOTE>; that with his &s;tripes we are healed <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah iii. 5.&mdash;</NOTE>."</P>
<P>By virtue of that holy &s;acrifice the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins is gained; the awakening power of that &s;entence which is due to &s;in, is felt in a &s;tate of alienation from God; and as we believe, that if one "died for all, then were all dead," &s;o we believe that he who was crucified, dead and buried, likewi&s;e tri|umphed over the grave, and now "&s;itteth at the right-hand of God," in a glorified body, to make interce&s;&s;ion for man, in order that he might effectu|ally purcha&s;e, and redeem to him&s;elf, a people to the prai&s;e of his name; and diffu&s;e, throughout his univer&s;al empire, a &s;imilarity of opinion and na|ture, ari&s;ing from the experience of his univer&s;al redeeming love.</P>
<P>I am no Arian, far from it:&mdash;I believe in the clear emphatic te&s;timonies laid down in holy writ, that Chri&s;t was more than a prophet. I repeat my belief, that he &s;uffered, died, a&s;cended, and is now come "the &s;econd time, without &s;in, to &s;alvation <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. ix: 28.</NOTE>," in order to reconcile the world to him&s;elf. I know many are willing to admit that he died for all, as all were in a &s;tate of death: and that, by the imputation of his righteou&s;ne&s;s, all are ju&s;tified in the &s;ight of God. Whereas I think it more ju&s;t to proceed in
<PB N="65" REF="037439_0082_100D43AB9DC41248">
the language of the holy in&s;pired apo&s;tle; that "they which live, &s;hould not henceforth live to them&s;elves; but to him who died for them and ro&s;e again;" that there may be an effectual redemption, a thorough change; not the imputation of righteou&s;|ne&s;s, without works; but a real &s;ub&s;tantial righte|ou&s;ne&s;s in the heart and life; which may operate upon, and regulate the mind and will, and lead us to a conformity to his divine nature: not a righteou&s;ne&s;s imputed to us from what Chri&s;t did and &s;uffered without us; but a righteou&s;ne&s;s rai&s;ed by him with in us, through our &s;urrendering our&s;elves to his go|vernment, and yielding entire &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his heart-clean&s;ing, refining power.</P>
<P>However this doctrine may reli&s;h with &s;ome, I am convinced he died for all, that all &s;hould be &s;a|ved; that, through him, we might be ju&s;tified in the &s;ight of God; that we might put on "the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, with all his divine affections."</P>
<P>"The whole creation of God groaneth toge|ther <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 22.&mdash;</NOTE>, to be cloathed upon with a hou&s;e from hea|ven <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. v. 22</NOTE>;" not an imaginary hou&s;e, and an imaginary righteou&s;ne&s;s; but to be cloathed upon with the grace of complete &s;alvation; to put on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; having fir&s;t put off the old man, with all his works, and with all his corrupt wi&s;dom, or

<P>"Chri&s;t is made unto us Wi&s;dom, Righteou&s;ne&s;e Sanctification, and Redemption.</P>
<P>In remembering therefore that he died for us, let us con&s;ider what follows; "that henceforth we &s;hould not live to our&s;elves. I am crucified with Chri&s;t <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. ii. 20&mdash;</NOTE>," &s;ays one of the apo&s;tles, as a private per|&s;on; and it &s;hould, and ought to be, the language in truth of each individual, through all &s;ucceeding ages. "Neverthele&s;s, I live; yet not I, but Chri&s;t liveth in me." He is become my righteou&s;ne&s;s; not by imputation only&mdash;but he actually liveth in me; and the life which I now live, is by the faith of the Son of God. I think I may now &s;ay, "Let us pre&s;s forward toward the mark of the prize of the high calling of God <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Phil. iii. 14.</NOTE>." Let us be crucified with Chri&s;t, "crucified to the world, and the world to us."</P>
<P>O! my friends, for &s;uch I term you in the cour&s;e of that univer&s;al love which reacheth forth to the whole human race, which floweth from him who hath thus wrought for me, and "brought life and immortality to light" in my &s;oul. Is any one of you de&s;irous of being informed, "how much owe&s;t

<P>Examine the ri&s;ing &s;ugge&s;tions of your own minds; you are not formed to live merely to your|&s;elves, merely within the contracted bounds of human privileges, in the narrow limits of mortality. Con|&s;ider the dignity of your nature; you are formed for the mo&s;t glorious purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>I earne&s;tly wi&s;h the ri&s;ing youth would lay the&s;e things &s;eriou&s;ly to heart, and often meditate upon them, as one formerly did, who thus expre&s;&s;es him|&s;elf, "While I was mu&s;ing the fire burned. My heart was hot within me; then &s;pake I with my tongue, Lord, make me to know my end, and the mea&s;ure of my days, what it is, that I may know how frail I am <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;lm xxxix. 3, 4.</NOTE>."&mdash; That they would contemplate the great de&s;ign of Providence, with regard to their immortality, which would le&s;&s;en their e&s;teem of the un&s;ub&s;tantial joys of time, and engage them to pur|&s;ue tho&s;e which are "un&s;peakable and full of glory" for ever. "While I was mu&s;ing the fire burned."</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="037439_0085_100D43B1D38EB2D8">Continue this mu&s;ing, this &s;tate of meditation: prize the invitations of the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, merci|fully extended to your immortal &s;pirits: and let your minds mount upwards: remember your pious predece&s;&s;ors, now perhaps in glory; and their con|nexions in the world of &s;pirits: likewi&s;e put this que&s;tion to your&s;elves upon every &s;erious occa&s;ion, "How much owe&s;t thou unto my Lord?"</P>
<P>I am fully convinced, were the chri&s;tian world in general to leave out exterior ceremonies, and enter more into this inward meditation, their minds would be more largely repleni&s;hed with di|vine fruits; and tho&s;e who are entering as it were upon the wilderne&s;s of this world, would then par|take of the advantage.

I think, without violence to the text, you may learn from it that you are de&s;tined for immortality: but the love of worldly things is too apt to engage the attention of that immortal part, the &s;oul; which oc|ca&s;ions, to many, the want of their knowing the great and glorious end for which they were formed, "a little lower than the angels," and intended to be crowned "with glory and honour."</P>

"the end of all things is at hand:" flatter not your|&s;elves therefore with length of days, and a long pro&s;perity of worldly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;uffer me to be&s;eech you, for the &s;ake of your immortal &s;ouls.</P>
<P>"What do I owe to my God?&mdash;What do I not owe him?"&mdash;He hath &s;natched me as a brand out of the fire: and I would not, though to gain the world, tread back again in the path of folly.</P>
<P>I know it by experience, and therefore I would per&s;uade you, not to turn a&s;ide from the God of your &s;alvation; but to acknowledge the infinite debt you owe him, and to pay him daily with obe|dience, adoration, and prai&s;e.</P>
<P>Our &s;ins have been great, and our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions <HI>never</HI> could have been obliterated, had not Chri&s;t done it for us; let us therefore no longer dwell upon the rock of Pre&s;umption with Satan. who hath been a lyar from the beginning; but let us ra|ther de&s;cend into the valley of Humility and Peace, and &s;ettle accounts with the God of our lives, from whom I had &s;trayed to that degree that my life be|came a burden to me, and I have wi&s;hed that I had never been born; but Chri&s;t, who was "a friend to the publicans and &s;inners," is now become "the rock of my &s;alvation!" he hath cau&s;ed me to tru&s;t in him, and to &s;eek the Lord my God. The debt I
<PB N="71" REF="037439_0088_100D43B90FB7AA98">
owe is infinite, I de&s;ire ever to acknowledge it with all po&s;&s;ible gratitude; and to do my utmo&s;t towards the di&s;charge of it, while I have my being.</P>
<P>If there is a &s;oul within the audience of my voice, which (upon this awful query) "How much owe&s;t thou unto my Lord?" is ready to apprehend, that it owes too much ever to hope for a di&s;charge, or freedom from the heavy load of debt it has contrac|ted; I have a little to &s;ay to &s;uch, even from my own experience: thy tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions do not exceed the bounds of his mercy; he &s;till careth for thee, with an inexpre&s;&s;ible fatherly care and tenderne&s;s. Even when his afflictions are upon thee, they are intended for thy good. "The brui&s;ed reed he will not break, the &s;moaking flax he will not quench." The more any of you &s;ee your real &s;tate, the more you remember the favours you have received, and feel the burden of your inju&s;tice and ingratitude, the more readily will he meet the penitent di&s;po&s;ition of your minds.</P>
<P>I have no manner of doubt but he, "who&s;e work is &s;alvation," who "came into the world" purely and purpo&s;ely "to &s;ave &s;inners," will carry on his own work, and, as you wholly re&s;ign your|&s;elves to his forming hand, will purify your hearts, reconcile you to the Father, and make you ever|la&s;ting in&s;tances and monuments of his infinite

mercy. Lift up therefore thy head in hope, who|ever thou art, in this humbled penitent &s;tate; for "thy &s;alvation draws nigh," Thou owe&s;t abun|dance to thy Lord: and there is an abundance which thou can&s;t never pay: but there is the good Samaritan, ever ready to do for thee, as for him, who going from Jeru&s;alem to Jericho, "fell among robbers;" by whom he was wounded; "and" to &s;ay, "take care of him, and I will pay." There is a glorious &s;ound from the great and good "friend of publicans and &s;inners;" he is ready to &s;ay to thee who art in this penitent &s;tate before him, "Take thy bill and write down fifty." He will "blot out thy &s;ins as a cloud, and thy tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ions as a thick cloud <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah xliv, 22.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>I cannot but remember with renewed feeling, and warm emotion of heart, the day that anxiety (in the view of my condition) &s;eized me; and how his mercy relieved me from it. He made my &s;oul feel his compa&s;&s;ion, and in the depths of gratitude thankfully to adore him. And hence I often feel a tenderne&s;s of mind towards tho&s;e who are weary of vanity, and heavy laden with a &s;en&s;e of their ma|nifold tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions. I be&s;eech &s;uch, by the mercy of GOD, that they would fly to him in their an|gui&s;h of mind; for it is he, and he alone that can &s;peak peace to the &s;inner; tho' your unright|cou&s;ne&s;s

may be great, it is not in any degree of pro|portion to his infinite mercy! Again, &s;uch among you to whom I have &s;poke, who delight to dwell in the path of temptation, wherein you have too long continued; I warn you to con&s;ider, that you are in the road to de&s;truction.</P>
<P>I would not give up, like E&s;au, "my birth-right" to &s;eek "a place of repentance with tears, and not find it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. 12.16, 17.&mdash;</NOTE>." O my &s;oul! for ever acknowledge how much thou owe&s;t unto thy Lord! Let none &s;ay "he hath ble&s;&s;ed me variou&s;ly, and in &s;ome future time I will awake my &s;oul to gratitude, I have now &s;omething el&s;e to do;" like him who, when an apo&s;tle "rea&s;oned of righteou&s;ne&s;s, temperance and judgment to come," replied, "Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient &s;ea&s;on I will call for thee <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Acts xxiv. 25.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>The like di&s;po&s;ition continues to prevail in too many; and this &s;eems to be the language of their hearts, "Go thy way this time; call upon me when I have lived to my&s;elf, and an&s;wered my own pur|po&s;es a little longer: vi&s;it me at &s;ome di&s;tant time hence." Oh! rather "to-day, while it is called to-day.&mdash;Harden not thy heart:" do not defer thy repentance a moment; thou knowe&s;t not what <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">

Thou ha&s;t hitherto trampled upon the goodne&s;s and the mercies of the God that made thee; venture not on pre&s;umption and delay. Time is uncertain: Immortality is at hand.</P>
<P>I be&s;eech you therefore, my friends, at the pre|&s;ent time, that you will lay to heart the nece&s;&s;ity of your making up this great account; delay it not to the decline of life. Many are on the brink of the grave! reflect upon your extreme danger! think not of crouding the account of your repentance in|to your la&s;t hour of life! you will find it extremely difficult to labour under the infirmities of the body upon a death-bed, without a rea&s;onable ground of hope: all the offers of mercy having been long continued, and often repeated; yet by you as long and as often rejected; what then will di&s;charge you from that dreadful account! I wi&s;h it may never be the ca&s;e of any within the audience of my, voice. Let us all immediately ponder, rightly con&s;ider, and &s;eriou&s;ly improve this con&s;ideration, "How much owe&s;t thou unto my Lord?"</P>

<HEAD>THE FOLLOWING DISCOURSE WAS DELIVERED ON THE 22d DAY OF THE FIFTH MONTH, 1767, AT THE FRIERS, IN BRISTOL.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE frequently thought, and the &s;entiment hath been confirmed from my own ob&s;ervation and experience, that a great and excellent point would be gained, highly conducive to the advantage of mankind, did they generally, though from no &s;urer guide than tradition, &s;ub&s;cribe with heart and mind to that certain truth recorded in holy writ:</P>

<P>As &s;uch a per&s;ua&s;ion, from whatever grounds it ari&s;es, naturally tends to influence the conduct to
<PB N="82" REF="037439_0099_100D43CB945B45F0">
avoid evil, and to pur&s;ue that which is good; and with regard to many, it hath proved a &s;tep to their nearer acquaintance with God, who is the only &s;ure guide to true happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Indeed I &s;carce think there can be many, if there be any, who are hardy enough to deny the exi&s;tence of a &s;upreme Being; but believe on the contrary, that many, through the divine favour, enlightened to &s;ee their duty, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted to di&s;charge it; do, in con&s;equence of the&s;e favours, contemplate, with &s;atisfaction inexpre&s;&s;ible, the&s;e attributes of the mo&s;t high God, here mentioned by the p&s;almi&s;t; and could I be induced to think, that any part of man|kind had &s;werved from their duty for want of a firm conviction of tho&s;e his attributes, as relative to his creatures; and of the certainty that there is really "a God who judgeth the earth:" I &s;ay, could I believe their minds were de&s;titute of this animating and enlivening pro&s;pect of his power, omni&s;cience, and goodne&s;s, in his &s;uperintendant care, and pre|&s;ent judging the earth, I &s;hould deem &s;uch but a very little removed, if any, from the &s;tate of the Athenians, upon who&s;e altar the holy apo&s;tle di&s;covered an in&s;cription,
"To the unknown God <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xvii. 23.</NOTE>."
<PB N="83" REF="037439_0100_100D43CDAFB85AB8">
Indeed a language that was &s;poken formerly hath been too much adopted by &s;ucceeding generations; numbers of whom have been like tho&s;e men of Jeru|&s;alem, who &s;aid, "the Lord will not do good, neither will he do evil <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Zeph. i. 12.</NOTE>." Many (&s;educed by the grand deceiver and his agents) have endeavoured to e&s;trange and withdraw them&s;elves from the Ar|bitrator of the whole earth: they have hence grown dark in their imaginations, and in like manner thus rea&s;oned with them&s;elves, "He will do us no good, why therefore &s;hould we &s;eek him?&mdash;he will do us no harm; why &s;hould we fear him?" This we may ju&s;tly look upon, as the mo&s;t unhappy &s;eduction of mind! as it mi&s;leads to the utmo&s;t di&s;tance, (without timely recovery) from that &s;tate of obedi|ence, in which we are only capable of happine&s;s, through the favourable notice of our Father who is in heaven.</P>
<P>But we may ju&s;tly conclude, that &s;uch impiety pa&s;t not the attention of an all-&s;eing God, in as much as he replied, "I will puni&s;h tho&s;e men of Jeru&s;alem, who have &s;aid, The Lord doeth us no good, why &s;hould we &s;eek him? he will not do us any harm, why &s;ould we fear him!"</P>
<P>The certainty of his &s;uperintendency, hath con|tinued to be the happine&s;s of all the wi&s;e and good

in all ages; and it is the&s;e, and only the&s;e, that di&s;cern wherein true happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts. Hence hath it become, and &s;till remains, an e&s;tabli&s;hed glorious truth, accompanied with, and confirmed by, the voice of all generations.</P>
<P>Under this head in particular, a petition or prayer that was put up to Him who hath created the earth, and a&s;&s;igned a reward to the righteous, by Agur the &s;on of Jaketh, hath appeared to my mind, as nece&s;|&s;ary at this day to be adopted by every individual who is de&s;irous of living to the be&s;t, wi&s;e&s;t and hap|pie&s;t purpo&s;e of life; without which we had better never have lived: and I cannot but recommend it mo&s;t particularly to You, the ri&s;ing generation, who&s;e minds I tru&s;t are at times &s;u&s;ceptable of pro|per impre&s;&s;ions, who are not become &s;laves to the vanity and lu&s;ts of the world: and indeed it &s;eems like the language of one that is entering upon the &s;tage of life: "Two things have I required of thee, deny me them not before I die! Remove far from me vanity and lies; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me; le&s;t I be full and deny thee, and &s;ay; Who is the Lord? or le&s;t I be poor, and &s;teal, and take the name of my God in vain <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxx. 7, 8, 9.</NOTE>!"</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="037439_0102_100D43D2E28FC740">The &s;ub&s;tance of this memorable requi&s;ition hath appeared to my mind, during the cour&s;e of a long &s;eries of ob&s;ervations of men and times; with regard to its import in point of religion, virtue, the love and peace of God; as including indeed all that is good and nece&s;&s;ary for our &s;afe conduct and &s;upport through this life, to that completion of happine&s;s propo&s;ed as the final reward of the righteous.</P>
<P>But how will &s;ome be able to prefer a petition to a power in whom, alas! they have no tru&s;t? who would gladly be po&s;&s;e&s;t of, and are much better plea&s;ed with, &s;haring a crown of wicked pro&s;perity in this world, than with a pro&s;pect of a crown of pure and perfect felicity, in a &s;tate of endle&s;s fu|turity.</P>

<P>And indeed without this ble&s;&s;ed hope, we are of all creatures, the mo&s;t mi&s;erable! being daily &s;ur|rounded with lamentation and woe! combating with &s;ecret or obvious di&s;tre&s;&s;es! and encountering, from the cradle to the grave, a perpetual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion and variety of afflictions!

<P>THE whole Book of Canticles is under&s;tood and taken in the way of &s;imilitude, or meta|phor, &s;etting forth that clo&s;e connection, that near and dear relation, which eternally &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between CHRIST and his church; and in this &s;en&s;e it cer|tainly conveys in&s;truction, very profitable as well as very delightful, to that mind which hath dedica|ted it&s;elf to the love and obedience of him, its on|ly rightful LORD.</P>
<P>The Church is called " a fountain of Gardens <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">iv. 15.</NOTE>;" which &s;eems to me very evidently to imply that inclo&s;ed collected &s;trength, beauty, regularity; tho&s;e con&s;olatory refre&s;hments; that &s;teady firmne&s;s of thought, unity of heart, and divine affection, which becomes a people that well under&s;tand what is meant by the &s;olemn injunction of "girding up

<P>O you that are in the bloom of life, and &s;urround|ed with the impetuous waves of divers pa&s;&s;ions; who continue yet uncorrected, unrefined by divine grace; may you diligently and &s;eriou&s;ly reflect up|on your extreme want of re&s;emblance to "the gar|den inclo&s;ed;" and of an&s;wering thereby the graci|ous de&s;ign of your Maker concerning you! May you be directed "by the &s;till &s;mall voice <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">1 Kings xix. 12.</NOTE>," which the LORD GOD will make u&s;e of, and meet you with "in the garden <NOTE N="(*)" PLACE="foot">Gen. iii. 8.</NOTE>;" in order to reclaim you, and to draw you to him&s;elf! May all that &s;tand in &s;lippery places, make him their refuge, that they may know him, to calm every tumult in the mind; to crown them with the joys of obedience; and to direct their &s;teps aright thro' life, to his honour, and their own true and la&s;ting happine&s;s!</P>
<P>May all who mourn for want of a place of re&s;t, attain this happy &s;ituation, all who are ready to cry out as one formerly did, "Woe is me that I &s;ojourn in Me&s;hech, and dwell in the tents of Ke|dar <NOTE N="(&dagger;)" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm cxx. 5.</NOTE>!"

<P>"O that the &s;alvation of I&s;rael would come out of Sion, then &s;hould Jacob rejoice, and I&s;rael &s;hould be right glad."

This concern has prompted many to enquire what is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary for them to believe and practice in order to render them the proper objects of divine complacence, and furni&s;h them with a well-ground|ed hope of a glorious and happy immortality. Ma|ny of the hone&s;t and &s;incere of every Nation under Heaven, have formed different ideas of the requi|&s;ites to &s;alvation, and of cour&s;e have pur&s;ued as different mea&s;ures to accompli&s;h that de&s;irable end. It is not my pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s, to particularize any of tho&s;e various &s;y&s;tems of Faith, which are adopted by any party among&s;t mankind; it is not to contro|vert matters, in which &s;incere men of the various denominations mo&s;t &s;urely believe; but rather to recommend them always to &s;tand open to convicti|on, and a &s;trict attention to tho&s;e rules of conduct, which appear to them mo&s;t agreeable to the will of Heaven. I &s;hall therefore addre&s;s my&s;elf to tho&s;e, in whatever religious &s;ociety they are found, who&s;e hone&s;t enquiries have not yet been attended with &s;ufficient conviction, or led them clearly to perceive what are the terms on which their future happine&s;s depends, and who are therefore looking one upon another, whil&s;t this important que&s;tion is found, at lea&s;t in their hearts if not in their mouths, "Men and Brethren, what &s;hall we do to be &s;aved?"</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="037439_0150_100D443CE31D0380">I &s;hall not pre&s;ume arrogantly to dictate to any, re&s;pecting matters of &s;o important a concern as that of the &s;alvation of the &s;oul; every man &s;hould exer|ci&s;e tho&s;e talents with which the Father of lights has endued him, in a clo&s;e and &s;incere attention to the voice of the internal Teacher, and in the di&s;covery of tho&s;e truths both practical and &s;peculative which have an immediate relation to the happine&s;s of a Being circum&s;tanced as he is. I &s;hall &s;imply pro|po&s;e tho&s;e things which from my own experience as an individual appear to me worthy of God for their author, and worthy of man's mo&s;t &s;erious attention. It is an indi&s;putable truth that we made not our|&s;elves: "We are thine offspring, thou ha&s;t made us and not we our&s;elves," &s;ays the prophet in his appeal to God. The matter which forms the uni|ver&s;e, the vehicles which the &s;oul informs, and the intellectual powers and faculties we po&s;&s;e&s;s, derived their being from the eternal fountain of all power and intelligence, whom we characterize by the aw|ful names of Jah, Jehovah and God. It is al&s;o clear to me that we were brought into exi&s;tence with the benevolent de&s;ign of finally &s;u&s;taining the confluent dignities of Glory, Honour, Immortality and eternal Life; the Lord Almighty hath in un|&s;peakable mercy promi&s;ed, that after we have endu|red a &s;ea&s;on of probation on earth, a conflict with our pa&s;&s;ions excited by numerous cau&s;es, and a fight of afflictions, we &s;hould finally receive a glorious re|ward,
<PB N="134" REF="037439_0151_100D443EE0EFF608">
a perpetuity of unmixed felicity in the un|known regions of eternity. But this de&s;irable and excellent end is not to be effected by what is gener|ally called fate, the laws of nece&s;&s;ity, or the arbitra|ry will and power of the Author of our exi&s;tence. God has con&s;tituted us free and intelligent beings, and endued us with faculties capable of apprehend|ing and practi&s;ing tho&s;e duties which he makes the condition of our final acceptance with him: he offers, but does not impo&s;e happine&s;s on his crea|tures; he &s;hews us the &s;piritual Canaan, he gives us power to po&s;&s;e&s;s it, but does not compel us to enter into it; good and evil are clearly &s;et before us, but our election is not con&s;trained to either; the Sovereign of the univer&s;e is no re&s;pector of per&s;ons, for of one blood he made all nations that dwell on the face of the earth; they &s;tand in the &s;ame relation to the univer&s;al Father, Shepherd and Bi&s;hop of Souls, who tenderly invites the whole race of man|kind to inherit the joy of his &s;alvation. To this doctrine the holy apo&s;tle bore an ample and explicit te&s;timony: "Of a truth, &s;aid he, I perceive that God is no re&s;pector of per&s;ons, but in every nation tho&s;e who fear him and work righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall be accepted of him <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts x. 34, 35.&mdash;</NOTE>."&mdash;"If ye live after the fle&s;h ye &s;hall die, but if through the &s;pirit ye mortify the deeds of the body, ye &s;hall live <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 13.</NOTE>." This is a pro|po&s;ition that relates to every individual in the va&s;t community of mankind, however circum&s;tanced,
<PB N="135" REF="037439_0152_100D44406AEA01F8">
whether bond or free, or in whatever climate he re|&s;ides.</P>
<P>All this indeed may be acknowledged both by tho&s;e within and without the audience of my voice, who are yet in doubt what they &s;hall do to be &s;aved with an everla&s;ting &s;alvation; they want to be in|formed of the preci&s;e ideas that &s;hould be affixed to the conditions contained in the text, though per|haps they readily apprehend the terms life and death imply future happine&s;s and mi&s;ery. I &s;hall the refore attempt according to the ability I am en|dued with, to give you my thoughts on the impor|tant &s;ubject in que&s;tion at this time. To "live after the fle&s;h," is to live in the gratification of our animal appetites and pa&s;&s;ions, beyond the bounds of rea&s;on temperence and &s;obriety, which as it fre|quently introduces numerous di&s;orders into the animal &s;y&s;tem, and aggravates the infirmities to which the&s;e corruptable bodies are incident, &s;o it affects the good of &s;ociety, and renders unfit for tho&s;e contemplations and that felicity which is adapted to the dignity of rational and immortal &s;pirits, beings whom God in his wi&s;dom "has made a little (and perhaps but a little) lower than the angels <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. ii. 7.</NOTE>," and who would crown them with a &s;uperior glory, honour and happine&s;s to that which animal gratifications can confer on their deluded voteries. Whil&s;t we are in the body we mu&s;t
<PB N="136" REF="037439_0153_100D4441F903B400">
expect to find tho&s;e appetites, affections and pa&s;&s;i|ons which belong to our nature; but the&s;e are to be re&s;tricted within the bounds of virtue, and attended to in proportion to our exigencies and nece&s;&s;ities, of which the divine principle which God has graci|ou&s;ly implanted in our hearts ought to determine.</P>
<P>This principle of intelligence, although called by a variety of names in the different profe&s;&s;ions among&s;t men, is the &s;ame in nature throughout all mankind. It is the &s;pirit in man that giveth a right under&s;tanding; it is the light that more or le&s;s enlightens every man; it is the word of God in the heart; the word of faith which the apo&s;tle preached to the gentiles; it is the grace that hath appeared to all men, teaching them to deny ungodline&s;s and the world's lu&s;ts, and to live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and godly in this pre&s;ent world; and finally it is the &s;upreme rea&s;on, the law of truth and rectitude, the te&s;t of virtue and vice, which God him&s;elf hath erected in the hearts of all men; and happy are tho&s;e who hear and obey it in all things.</P>
<P>I would not be under&s;tood to mean that this principle of which I am &s;peaking is de&s;igned to in|&s;truct us in all truths which the human mind may attempt to inve&s;tigate, or to give a clear in&s;ight into tho&s;e numerous &s;peculative &s;ubjects, which have, not only unprofitably employed mankind and

<P>Various are our obligations and duties, religious, relative and &s;ocial, ari&s;ing from our various connex|ions, natural and divine: the relation we &s;tand in to the Author of our being is that of children; filial fear, obedience and wor&s;hip is therefore our indi&s;|pen&s;ible duty to him, in our conduct at all times, throughout our whole lives. The relation which our fellow creatures &s;tand in to us, is that of bre|thren, children of the &s;ame univer&s;al Father, and formed for the &s;ame glorious and happy end; ju&s;tice, charity and brotherly kindne&s;s are therefore our indi&s;pen&s;ible obligations unto mankind. There are al&s;o various accidental relations, &s;uch as father, governor, ma&s;ter, &s;ervant and numerous others, all which have their corre&s;pondent duties.

at this time may concur with me in &s;entiment, but they, as well as I, are perhaps con&s;cious of having failed in numerous in&s;tances of di&s;charging their religious duties to God and their &s;ocial duties to mankind. We have all &s;inned and fallen &s;hort of the glory of God; we have multiplied our tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ions without number! and our iniquities ri&s;e before us as a thick cloud! which ob&s;cures the brightne&s;s of that eternal Sun of righteou&s;ne&s;s, which would otherwi&s;e illuminate our under&s;tandings with its marvellous light.

"Men and brethren what &s;hall we do to be &s;aved?" The condition of our reconciliation and redemption are very clearly expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;acred oracles of truth; the placability of the divine nature is repeat|edly a&s;&s;erted; he is repre&s;ented to us in the adora|ble character of a God of mercy, long &s;uffering and of un&s;peakable kindne&s;s; as a Being ready to blot out our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions from the cele&s;tial regi&s;ter, on our &s;incere repentance, and to remember them no more.</P>

This was the intere&s;ting doctrine which the Saviour of Man promulgated, and happy are tho&s;e who hear and obey it. <Q>Repent and be converted that your &s;ins may be forgiven you.</Q> It is not the a&s;&s;ent of the lip and of the tongue to the glorious truths of the Go&s;pel; but a &s;urrender of the will and affections, a renovation of heart, and conformity to the divine Image, which can alone gain us admi&s;&s;ion into the New Jeru&s;alem, the Ci|ty of God.</P>

Therefore in all tho&s;e calamities to which we are &s;ubject in the hou&s;e of our pilgrimage, we have a place of re|fuge to flee to, where &s;afety is alone to be &s;ound; though indeed we mu&s;t feel in degree as men, yet we may po&s;&s;e&s;s the patience, re&s;ignation and ho|ly fortitude of Chri&s;tians, who are looking for a better country, a more excellent inheritance in that city who&s;e inhabitant cannot &s;ay "I am &s;ick."</P>
<P>Be ye therefore &s;tedfa&s;t, immoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, fora&s;much as ye know that your labour &s;hall not be in vain. Be ye in your &s;everal &s;tations in the church, and

in the world, as way-marks to the hone&s;t inquirers who are a&s;king their way to Zion, and from a true &s;en&s;e of their condition are crying out "what &s;hall we do to be &s;aved?" &s;hew forth by your example of charity, &s;obriety, temperance and holine&s;s of life, that you are redeemed from the &s;pirit of the world, that lies in wickedne&s;s; be not captivated by its trifling amu&s;ements, nor in&s;nared by its lying vanities, but retain the fear of the Lord which will keep the heart clean, and prove a &s;ource of &s;ure&s;t con&s;olation when all things el&s;e will be una|vailing! let the purity of your lives demon&s;trate that you are attentive to things more excellent, things that are permanent and eternal, e&s;&s;entially relating to the &s;alvation of the &s;oul! by this means you will become the con&s;ecrated temples of the holy gho&s;t, and be a means of leading others in the way of righteou&s;ne&s;s!</P>
<P>Finally, my brethren, farewell! I commend you to God, the &s;hepherd of I&s;rael, and to the word of his grace; this is alone able to build us up in the mo&s;t holy faith, to direct our feet in the way of Righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace; and finally to put us in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a glorious inheritance among&s;t the &s;aints, that will never fade away.</P>

<HEAD>A DISCOURSE DELIVERED AT STOCKPORT, THE 20TH OF THE ELEVENTH MONTH, 1768.</HEAD>
<P>AN acceptable &s;acrafice, which the holy apo&s;|tle offered unto the God of all grace, is at all times proper, and at all times acceptable; ari&s;ing from the &s;ame &s;en&s;ibility, it was couched in the&s;e words, "Thanks be to God for his un&s;peakable gift:" It aro&s;e from one not a wit behind the apo&s;|tle, who&s;e acquired parts were remarkably great, and ju&s;tly eminent for his religious experience: yet in the contemplation of the height and depth, the length and breadth of the love of God in Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord, and the manife&s;tation of divine kindne&s;s, he found expre&s;&s;ions in&s;ufficient; and, in &s;hort, &s;aid more than language could expre&s;s, in terming it&mdash;an un&s;peakable gift.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="037439_0172_100D446AD8DA1368">I would endeavour to lead our minds to a proper contemplation upon this un&s;peakable gift, and ear|ne&s;tly wi&s;h we may be &s;o wi&s;e as to enter into it with that reverence, with that attention, and with &s;olemn wor&s;hip, which become worthy receivers of a multitude of unmerited mercies.</P>
<P>The holy &s;criptures of the New Te&s;tament (which are pre&s;erved through mercy) give us a large and particular account of the incarnation, life, &s;ufferings, death, and a&s;cen&s;ion of the holy Je&s;us; and it were much to be wi&s;hed there was a more general attention among&s;t the profe&s;&s;ors of the name of Chri&s;t, to ponder his adorable acts, en|deavouring to accompany him in reverent recollecti|on of the various &s;teps he took whil&s;t in the body prepared for him; as it might lay a well grounded hope (if we accompany him with care) to be found coheirs with him in the cele&s;tial regions, in his glorified &s;tate, hereafter.</P>
<P>I account the holy &s;criptures an excellent trea|&s;ure, and I wi&s;h the ri&s;ing generation, were con|cerned to know the &s;criptures from their youth, which, through faith in the great and glorious ob|ject they propo&s;e, are able to make us wi&s;e unto &s;alvation: but notwith&s;tanding the glorious and
<PB N="156" REF="037439_0173_100D446DB2D16640">
excellent account of the holy Je&s;us, with re|gard to his being incarnate, conver&s;ing among men, and the delivery of many excellent precepts, the holy apo&s;tle mentions the &s;um and &s;ub&s;tance of the chri&s;tian religion as an un&s;peakable gift, which there was no language &s;ufficiently able to define and &s;et forth. I have thought, notwith&s;tanding this, it is an intelligible, though an un&s;peakable gift; in|telligible to the meane&s;t capacity; for the re&s;t of &s;aints is the provi&s;ion of God, for the various ranks of mankind, high and low, rich and poor: he is the God and Father of us all, who is over all, through all, and in all: and the religion of the ho|ly Je&s;us is not de&s;igned to be placed beyond the reach of vulgar capacities; its glorious nature not dependant on the &s;kill of human literature to un&s;old; it is ea&s;y and intelligible to the mind willing to learn it, and lies open to the &s;incere and upright heart, who con&s;iders it not as a &s;eene of ab&s;tru&s;e difficulties, my&s;terious matters, but as intended to regulate the affections, to rectify our natures, to guide us in wi&s;dom, and afterwards receive us into glory.</P>
<P>Some people think them&s;elves too high for reli|gion; the&s;e are mi&s;taken, for it adds dignity to the greate&s;t &s;tate, and, in it is real nobility. I have &s;ometimes feared &s;ome people think them&s;elves too

low for religion, as if it was the proper bu&s;ine&s;s of the rich, who had lei&s;ure and opportunity; and that the poor and laborious, the exerci&s;ed and di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed part of the family, were beneath religion. They are both mi&s;taken; for the God and Father of all, with an equal eye, beholds his family, his mighty family, the angels, the arch-angels, the triumphant hearts, and the militant hearts, who by faith and patience are &s;eeking to pa&s;s their time here in a conformity to their elder brethren: that, when mortality &s;hall be &s;wallowed up of immortali|ty, they might join the family on high.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, in this point of view, I look upon the workman&s;hip of God, and have no more doubt of a part in the family of the Mo&s;t High, whil&s;t conver&s;ant in the vici&s;&s;itudes of an earthly pilgrim|age, than when this tran&s;ient habitation of clay &s;hall re&s;olve to its original matter, and the eyes that &s;ee me now &s;hall &s;ee me no more: we are en|tering upon eternity and an indi&s;&s;oluble connexion with ever and ever. In this life God has diver&s;i|fied our ranks in unerring wi&s;dom, for the great purpo&s;e of his will; there is nothing low, in the eye of the Univer&s;al Parent, but vice, irreligion, a forgetfulne&s;s of God, and our&s;elves, and alie|nation to his nature; this, throughout all ranks, is eternally and unalterably incon&s;i&s;tent with accep|tance

<P>We are not at all a&s;hamed or afraid of advoca|ting the cau&s;e of &s;imple chri&s;tianity, under the ancient definition or de&s;cription of it, given by the holy Je&s;us, as "the leaven which the woman took and hid in three mea&s;ures of meal."&mdash;Not a&s;ha|med to define religion as de&s;igned to reform the heart, to make men pure and acceptable in the &s;ight of God, not wearied in our endeavours to impre&s;s on the minds of men, the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;i|ty of this un&s;peakable gift in them&s;elves, as religi|on flows from this gift; a gift adapted to every un|der&s;tanding and every &s;tate, and which the &s;ame apo&s;tle, writing to his &s;ons, after the common faith, further illu&s;trates in a manner worthy of all our attention; and, if regarded, would put an end to the controver&s;ies among&s;t chri&s;tians; "he gave him&s;elf for us that he might redeem us, from all ini|quity, and purify unto him&s;elf a peculiar people zealous of good works."</P>
<P>I own I look upon this to be the great de&s;ign of this un&s;peakable gift, and a compendious account
<PB N="159" REF="037439_0176_100D44742B8EF0A0">
of the religion of Chri&s;t; "the grace of God that brings &s;alvation, hath appeared to all men, teach|ing us, that denying ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;t, we &s;hould live righteou&s;ly, &s;oberly, and godly, looking for the ble&s;&s;ed hope and glorious appear|ance of the great God and our Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who gave him&s;elf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto him|&s;elf a peculiar people zealous of good works." I can hardly think that any are &s;o hardy as to a&s;&s;ert there's either fal&s;ehood or incon&s;i&s;tency in this apo&s;|tolic definition of the great de&s;ign of the religion of Chri&s;t, however their lives may contradict their profe&s;&s;ion, and give the lie to their own a&s;&s;ent to the truths of religion. Scarce any can arrive to that degree of obduracy of mind, as to deny this to be the glorious intention of the religion of Chri&s;t: here is the un&s;peakable gift, "he gave him&s;elf for us;" he laid a&s;ide his glory, he came in the form of a &s;ervant, in a &s;tate of humiliation and poverty; was introduced into the world in a &s;table, laid in a manger, was (and not upon his own account) "a man of &s;orrow and acquainted with grief;" the whole &s;eries of his life was a con|tinued act of illu&s;trious virtue, in&s;tructive and ex|emplary, to &s;hew us the dignity of the religion he came to e&s;tabli&s;h, and to impre&s;s the minds of
<PB N="160" REF="037439_0177_100D4475B776FD68">
mankind, that they &s;hould walk as he walked. Af|ter having accompli&s;hed a pilgrimage of thirty-three years, he gave him&s;elf for us on Calvary's Mount, "the ju&s;t for the unju&s;t that he might bring us to God"&mdash;"He trod the wine-pre&s;s alone, and of the people there was none with him." He that had le|gions of angels at command, bore the contradicti|on of &s;inners; and that &s;acred countenance impre&s;t with divine glory, was &s;pit upon, crowned with thorns, as the mo&s;t notorious malefactor; yet, as a &s;heep, dumb before its &s;hearers, "he opened not his mouth."</P>
<P>I cannot avoid endeavouring to impre&s;s the recol|lection of the&s;e awful truths upon the minds of all &s;uch as profe&s;s to call upon the name of the Father, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and hope for &s;alvation through him; that they might accu&s;tom them&s;elves to rumi|nate upon the &s;tupendous exhibition of divine love; that they might carefully inquire how far the end is an&s;wered to them, and might apply, to their own advantage, that un&s;peakable gift, "he gave him&s;elf for us, was crucified, dead and buried;" but he aro&s;e again, and trampled over the powers of death, hell, and the grave, "led captivity cap|tive, and gave gifts to men, even the rebellious;" for this great purpo&s;e, the purpo&s;e of human re|demption, that he might redeem us; that through
<PB N="161" REF="037439_0178_100D4478766CB570">
his &s;tripes, we might know the glorious progre&s;s of redemption experimentally. As individuals, it is worth while to con&s;ider the terms of this gift, and its intention; that it &s;hould produce nece&s;&s;ary fruits of all worthy receivers; "he gave him&s;elf for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity."</P>
<P>I have frequently feared a dangerous mi&s;take with re&s;pect to this; have heard &s;ome expre&s;s their ap|prehen&s;ion of redemption from the penalty of &s;in, but not from the body of &s;in; though there may be an unwarrantable &s;tre&s;s laid upon it, it is one of the mo&s;t powerful calls to righteou&s;ne&s;s and holine&s;s of life. I have met with not a few who have con&s;i|dered it in a different light, as a kind of toleration for acting incon&s;i&s;tent with the purity of the divine nature, and an allowance for continuing in human frailty. The mind having lo&s;t its faith in the &s;uffi|ciency of the divine power, has mi&s;taken the inten|tion of this gift, and has looked upon it as a free|dom from wrath rather than iniquity; "what &s;hall we continue in &s;in that grace may abound?" There were &s;uch, in the primitive &s;tate of the church. I have heard &s;ome, &s;o remote from the nature of the chri&s;tian religion, the power and purity attend|ing it, as to a&s;&s;ert, there is no po&s;&s;ibility of re|demption from the reigning power of &s;in in this life; that the chri&s;tan redemption is unalterable,
<PB N="162" REF="037439_0179_100D447B0DF78FC0">
as to this, redeeming us from all iniquity, having doubled the &s;ufficiency of the divine grace; to change effectually, from a &s;tate of corruption, and having lo&s;t their faith in the power of God, it has been impo&s;&s;ible for them to make a proficiency in the divine life, But we have the utmo&s;t rea&s;on to be a&s;&s;ured, that it is "from all iniquity," from the reigning power of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, that the grace of God is able to do all things for us, to change the vile body of our affections, and make it like the body of Chri&s;t, able to take away our &s;tony hearts, and give us hearts of fle&s;h: but this brings religion nearer home than many chu&s;e to have it; takes it from the head to the heart, lays the axe to the root of the tree, and brings home to an anti|cipation of the &s;earch into their own &s;tates.</P>
<P>This is a grand rea&s;on for rejecting the chri&s;tian religion; but we mu&s;t &s;ub&s;cribe to all the truths of the go&s;pel, or be in the gall of bitterne&s;s and in the bond of iniquity. But the unerring wi&s;dom of God has been rejected, men have took them &s;elves out of the hands of God, and gone their own way, have endeavoured by the multiplicity of profe&s;&s;ions, and their own external performan|ces, and every invention of the human mind in the my&s;teries of ungodline&s;s, to evade this grand <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, "to redeem us from all iniquity;" but to put not only the mark of the forehead but these

more hidden tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions. There's a filthine&s;s of &s;pirit, that, to an all-&s;eeing eye, is equally dete&s;|table; &s;acred is our judge; there is a judgment|&s;eat covered with mercy to a hairs breadth; but we cannot advance one attribute and deprecate another. Though wonderful is his mercy, yet ju&s;tice, righteou&s;ne&s;s and truth, are e&s;&s;entials in the attributes of the mo&s;t high God. "Let me die the death of the righteous," let me rejoice when I pa&s;s through the regions of death,&mdash;is the wi&s;h of all; but they would not be brought to the te&s;t, that redemption from all iniquity, that tho|rough clean&s;ing, that turning of the hand upon them, and purging away not only their dro&s;s, but their tin, and reprobate &s;ilver. There's abundance of that among&s;t profe&s;&s;ors, there's a &s;elf-righteou&s;|ne&s;s of the law; it con&s;i&s;ts not only in action, but &s;peculation, in &s;plended opinions; this opinion hath pa&s;&s;ed for faith, and cheated many to wretchedne&s;s. Opinion re&s;embles faith &s;o much, that the eye had need be opened to di&s;cern the difference; yet a great one there is: many have &s;trong opinions concerning the work of religion; &s;ome have looked upon it as in&s;tantaneous, &s;ome otherwi&s;e. I confe&s;s with re&s;pect to that in&s;tanta|neous work, "I have not &s;o learned Chri&s;t;" far, be it from me to judge another man's &s;ervant, but I have not &s;o learned Chri&s;t, as to know, that to be an in&s;tantaneous, but a gradual work. Some
<PB N="164" REF="037439_0181_100D447F24E85188">
think there is a &s;udden death to &s;in, and a new birth to righteou&s;ne&s;s, in a moment. I have not traced the conduct of people profe&s;&s;ing the chri&s;tian religion, with an uncharitable eye; but I have of|ten ob&s;erved that in&s;tantaneous work to be of a &s;hort lived continuance; have &s;een &s;ome recur back again to their &s;ins, and their latter end has been wor&s;e than the beginning. When God &s;aid let there be light, there was light, a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of days and nights, the beauties of creation were gradually brought forth, till man was made in God's image.</P>
<P>I have not been de&s;titute of &s;ome degree of reli|gious experience, the prai&s;e I dedicate to God, the fruits to your &s;ervice. Religion has wore this a&s;pect with me, it has been a gradual work, a gra|dual advancement from faith to faith; but when people are enriched with unfelt truths, they call a &s;trong per&s;ua&s;ion of mind, faith, when it is on|ly opinion. Faith is promotive of redemption, the &s;aint's victory; this faith that works by love, &s;ubverts the &s;trong holds of Satan, re&s;tores people to a &s;tate of acceptance with God, impre&s;&s;ing the features of the king of heaven upon all their acti|ons: but this opinion, this mi&s;taken opinion, would pa&s;s by redemption from all iniquity; the leaven of the kingdom, would lead to a variety of actions, abundance of words and profe&s;&s;ions, and

&s;et the mind afloat above that &s;acred leaven, that un&s;peakable gift, which cannot be fully uttered. The Lord pre&s;erve us from this dangerous mi&s;|take.</P>
<P>I &s;peak to a people, many of whom are, I tru&s;t inquiring after things of the highe&s;t moment; I wi&s;h you well on your way, that your minds might not only reverence that un&s;peakable gift, but trace the &s;ource, and pur&s;ue the end. He gave him&s;elf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, that he might clean&s;e us from all &s;ilthi|ne&s;s of fle&s;h and &s;pirit, e&s;tabli&s;h our affections on things above; that the mind that was in Chri&s;t, might be in us. I look upon this to be the de&s;ign of chri&s;tianity: this un&s;peakable gift, the religion of Je&s;us, works &s;ecretly, powerfully and effectual|ly; &s;ometimes it draws to expre&s;&s;ions, oftentimes otherwi&s;e: the occa&s;ion of prai&s;e cea&s;ed not when there was &s;ilence in heaven for half an hour. May we &s;o hide the word in our hearts, as to witne&s;s its progre&s;s there. I have feared the multitude of con|ver&s;ation has betrayed the minds of the people; been afraid of people talking away religion by frequent u&s;e, familiarizing their minds to treat the things of God not with that feeling reverence, flowing from this un&s;peakable gift. Far be it from me to enfeeble my mind bent after things of the great|e&s;t moment. I know I regret with you, the too general conver&s;ation of the world goes upon other
<PB N="166" REF="037439_0183_100D4484038A0D38">
&s;ubjects; and things appertaining to life and god|line&s;s, are rather objects of contempt and deri&s;ion, than of that humble reverential awe that becometh us. This is too much the ca&s;e; yet there is a po&s;&s;i|bility of talking away religion, by a multiplicity of conver&s;ation, pa&s;&s;ing beyond our own light. I would rather endeavour to know what the Holy Gho&s;t meant by that &s;ilence in heaven for half an hour, than make religion too cheap by conver&s;a|tion:&mdash;Keep it in the heart: too much di&s;cour&s;e carries off the e&s;&s;ence of religion; keep the mind as a garden inclo&s;ed; a proper attention to this un|&s;peakable gift, will tend more to comfort and &s;trengthen than where a profe&s;&s;ion of words carries away the proper &s;en&s;ibility of our &s;tate and con|dition. I know the matter requires di&s;tinction; I want not to di&s;courage any thing of an heavenly birth: but fear &s;ome have been carried out of their depth, the divine &s;pirit of religion has been eva|porated, greatly to their lo&s;s. Let not tho&s;e who care for none of the&s;e things, run into di&s;cour&s;e &s;ubver&s;ive of religion. Wi&s;dom leads in the mid|dle paths of judgment; and though the gift is un|&s;peakable, yet we have a right under&s;tanding of the effects upon our own minds. We know there is a &s;un in the firmament, we feel it's warmth, it extends it's light and warmth through the globe, but the utmo&s;t intent of it's nature is inexplicable; the divi&s;ion of its rays, the &s;ource of it's heat,

after what manner placed in the planetary world, or how formed; the&s;e are inexplicable, &s;o is the &s;un of righteou&s;ne&s;s; but though the properties of the &s;un be un&s;peakable, we know, we rejoice in it's effect; we have indubitable proofs of it's ex|i&s;tence: &s;o the un&s;peakable gift, the &s;un of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s; to enlighten men, to guide them in wi&s;|dom, to unite them to their elder brother, to re|pleni&s;h their affections and &s;et them on things above. Though an un&s;peakable gift, yet intelligi|ble, reaches to the minds of men, affects them, quickens them, rai&s;es them from death and dead works, to a contemplation of tho&s;e things of infi|nite con&s;equence to them.</P>
<P>I cannot but intreat you of the ri&s;ing generation, carefully to attend to this gift,&mdash;in it's right-hand are length of days, on it's left-hand are riches and honor: watch unto prayer, be not a&s;hamed of this un&s;peakable gift, and it's tendency. What is the rea&s;on of the &s;ceptici&s;m and infidelity that is among&s;t us? it is enough now to make one ridicu|lous, to revive, in the remembrance of chri&s;ti|ans, their own principles. What is the rea&s;on that youth falls a prey to the gloomy doctrines of infidelity that abound in this age? the want of attending to this un&s;peakable gift. Were their minds endued with a &s;en&s;e of it's virtue, there would be no more rea&s;oning them out of the

efficacy of religion, and the exi&s;tance of this un|&s;peakable gift, than that there was no &s;un in the firmament. From the &s;tronge&s;t of all convictions, that of experience, they could give in their te&s;ti|mony to the nature, power, and &s;pirit of the chri&s;|tian religion, and their minds would he enabled to &s;ee that this is He, and we look not for another.</P>
<P>I be&s;eech you, therefore, my friends, &s;uch of you as know this un&s;peakable gift, &s;eek after a capacity of prai&s;ing God, of a&s;cribing thanks for this un&s;peakable gift: he that offers prai&s;e, glori|fies God, " and to him that ordereth his conver&s;a|tion aright will I &s;hew forth my &s;alvation." We have abundance of what is called public wor&s;hip, &s;ometimes many exterior acts, which amu&s;e the minds of mankind; but vain and fooli&s;h is it to apprehend infinity to be organized like us, and the ears of him that filleth immen&s;ity to be like ours. Thanks be to God for his un&s;peakable gift; let it appear by its own influence; it is the living that prai&s;e him; the glory of the workman is di&s;|covered by the beauty of the workman&s;hip. Was the mind endued with this un&s;peakable gift, and all within us brought into &s;ubjection to it's divine nature and tendency, there would be an ince&s;&s;ant oblation ari&s;ing with holy efficacy to a God-hearing prayer; though &s;ilent with regard to the human ear, yet intelligible to him.

<P>There is &s;omething farther couched in this affec|tionate &s;alutation, than the language of love; the lan|guage of wi&s;dom.&mdash;That wi&s;dom which is "profitable to direct <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccl. x. 10.&mdash;</NOTE>," &s;eems to me very evidently and very emi|nently di&s;played by the Father of mercy and kindne&s;s, in the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions; which, by divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I would endeavour a little to open, and to urge as words of &s;ome &s;ignification, unto all &s;uch who&s;e minds are at times turned to contemplate, and not only to contemplate, but al&s;o to pur&s;ue, "the things which make for peace <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiv. 19.</NOTE>."</P>

<P>There is no language, or form of words, &s;uffici|ently copious and expre&s;&s;ive, though rai&s;ed to the utmo&s;t extent or height of de&s;cription, for repre|&s;enting the adorable manife&s;tation of heavenly kindne&s;s, goodne&s;s, conde&s;cen&s;ion, and mercy; or for exhibiting the things which proceed from the grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t: but it is allowable to &s;peak whereof we know, according to the mea&s;ure of knowledge; and to utter acccording to the pro|portion of &s;trength given, what we now &s;ee in part, and what from experience we feel, of the

merciful kindne&s;s of God; and which, as we faithfully follow his will, we &s;hall hereafter more fully and comprehen&s;ively behold&mdash;This I appre|hend is nece&s;&s;ary for all, to whom a revelation of the Chri&s;tian Religion has been made by means of holy writ; and in an e&s;pecial manner, where He that is the di&s;coverer of &s;tates, has opened their un|der&s;tandings to believe the doctrines of the Chri&s;ti|an Religion, and the &s;acred records of that mira|culous favour and grace that came by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>But for my own part, I mu&s;t freely acknow|ledge there was a time of my life, in which I would gladly have relieved my&s;elf from following the ar|duous paths of religion, by turning a&s;ide into the paths of &s;ceptici&s;m and infidelity. My mind was ready to alledge, as &s;ome at this time of day may be, "How can we believe without evidence? there is not a &s;ufficient evidence of truth to con|vince my judgment, or to induce me to believe." I know this has been the allegation of &s;ome: but I have found there is no deficiency of evidence, but an unwillingne&s;s to admit the &s;orce of that evi|dence which would properly influence the mind; and I have rea&s;on to apprehend this has been the ca&s;e with others; for if there was a thorough &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, and di&s;po&s;ition of mind to receive the truth in the love of it; to endeavour after it in its genu|ine &s;implicity; to look at with a &s;ingle eye; and,
<PB N="173" REF="037439_0190_100D4494280456C8">
if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion, to &s;uppre&s;s or bani&s;h all the "buts and ifs;" we &s;hould &s;oon find the evidence of the Chri&s;tian Religion to be lively and inconte&s;tible, and effectually to operate to make us wi&s;e and good; wi&s;e, with the wi&s;dom that is to &s;alvation; and good, with the goodne&s;s that is of God, the &s;ource of goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>But whil&s;t people "take coun&s;el, and not of God," and &s;uffer them&s;elves to be "covered with a covering, and not of his &s;pirit <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah xxx. 1.</NOTE>," they are un|willing to admit the force of tho&s;e truths which would "&s;eparate the precious from the vile, and purify us according to his word."&mdash;While this is the ca&s;e that many deviate in point of faith, they may complain of the want of evidence re&s;pecting the certainty and truth of the Chri&s;tian Religion; and complain with as much ju&s;tice, as a man who wilfully hides him&s;elf in darkne&s;s, complains of his incapacity of &s;eeing. For we have &s;uch an evi|dence and under&s;tanding imparted by the light and grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as doubtle&s;s abun|dantly di&s;plays the immediate regard and love of God, as recorded in holy writ; and from which I freely acknowledge an internal illuminati|on nece&s;&s;ary, for all that would have valid claim to the Chri&s;tian Religion; whereby we obtain a firm

a&s;&s;urance of, and a well-grounded belief in, tho&s;e glorious truths.</P>
<P>We have &s;ometimes been accu&s;ed of allegorizing away the important truths of the Chri&s;tian Religi|on, as recorded in holy writ: it is far, very far, from our intention or inclination! We want to in|force them upon our&s;elves, upon our brethren, with all that requi&s;ite weight which commands their be|lief; calling to a belief of heart, not a mere a&s;&s;ent with the tongue; but "a belief of heart unto righteou&s;ne&s;s <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. x. 10.&mdash;</NOTE>."</P>
<P>We have been di&s;tingui&s;hed, and are not a&s;hamed of the di&s;tinction, for preaching Chri&s;t within; but we never preach a Chri&s;t within, oppo&s;ed to, or derogating from, a Chri&s;t without.&mdash;We fully be|lieve not only in his glorious and gracious appear|ance among&s;t the &s;ons of men, "as in the volume of the book it is written <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. x. 7.&mdash;</NOTE>;" but we al&s;o believe in his inward and &s;piritual appearance, "the &s;econd time without &s;in unto &s;alvation <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. ix. 28.&mdash;</NOTE>;" in which we are &s;upported by a "cloud of witne&s;&s;es <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. xii. 1.</NOTE>," and by the doctrine of the holy Author of the Chri&s;tian Religion, inforcing his inward and &s;piritual mani|fe&s;tation (the manife&s;tation of his grace) in as clear and indubitable a manner, as from the te&s;timonies delivered concerning his external appearance.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="037439_0192_100D4497D5B071C8">But the my&s;tery of ungodline&s;s hath powerfully wrought with &s;ome who profe&s;s the Chri&s;tian name, in oppo&s;ition to the force of tho&s;e te&s;timonies with regard to his internal appearance, or manife&s;tation of him&s;elf in the hearts of mankind; and to render inadmi&s;&s;ible the doctrine of an inward and &s;piritual communion, the revelation of light, life, and good to the &s;ouls of men, immediately imparted for our redemption and &s;anctification.&mdash;This would lead people home from the flowery path of ea&s;e and &s;peculation, into the arduous one of prac|tice: it would transfer religion from the head to the heart: and, in its progre&s;s, would remove every ob&s;tacle to the admi&s;&s;ion of the doctrine of an inward and &s;piritual manife&s;tation of the grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>

<P>"Yet once more will I &s;hake not the earth only, but al&s;o heaven <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. xii. 27.</NOTE>"&mdash;Not only the earth, not only again&s;t the inhabitants of the earth: but the work of God is made con&s;picuous in the awakening of the ungodly, for their conver&s;ion from &s;in and death, unto righteou&s;ne&s;s and life.&mdash;"Yet once more will I &s;hake heaven."&mdash; The glorious &s;peci|ous appearances of truth, and doctrines recorded and a&s;&s;ented to, but yet not reduced to experience; truths received and confe&s;&s;ed by the tongue, but the heart revolting from their efficacious in|fluence.</P>
<P>"Yet once more will I &s;hake not the earth only, but al&s;o heaven." And this word, yet once more, &s;ignifies the removing of tho&s;e things which are &s;haken. And undoubtedly the grace of our

Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in its manife&s;tation, procedure, and effects, would &s;hake every fal&s;e re&s;t in which any deluded &s;oul may have fixed its repo&s;e: He would &s;hake every fal&s;e re&s;t among tho&s;e under all names and di&s;tinctions to religion, who are tru&s;t|ing in name and in form, without the power, or an experience of its virtual effects upon the &s;oul; the&s;e all appertain to one family:&mdash;and not only &s;o but he would &s;hake every fal&s;e re&s;t, yea and the foundation, of tho&s;e who are building upon a pro|fe&s;&s;ion, and upon the apo&s;tle's te&s;timony of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; becau&s;e they are only building upon the credibility of tho&s;e truths, yet cannot experimen|tally &s;ay, Through the grace of our Lord Je&s;us, "We acknowledge truth, according to godline&s;s <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Titus i. 1.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>They that are of the world, come here al&s;o to a hou&s;e fortified with opinion, and are &s;upporting them&s;elves in having obtained a clear, full, and conci&s;e knowledge of the truth of the Chri&s;tian Religion. But there is a power that will &s;earch every fal&s;e foundation, and overturn every &s;uper|ficial dependence on human production, that is in|con&s;i&s;tent with the uniform tendency of his &s;acred law, fa&s;hioned upon the plan of unchangeable, everla&s;ting wi&s;dom.&mdash;It is not of man, or by man, but proceeds from the grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whereby tho&s;e truths are brought home

A &s;pecies of deviation from the power of truth, proceeding from the grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which would &s;earch the &s;ecret of every heart! It would open to the view of the attentive mind their nature, and the &s;ituation they are in; what is of God, and what is not of God; what is pure, and what is impure: it would ever prove a more deci&s;ive te&s;t in all our actions, a more certain criterion in our conduct through life, than, it is to be feared, the generality of Chri&s;tian pro|fe&s;&s;ors have attained, and which it is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible for the &s;trong man armed to produce,

<P>But although they are thus lifted up in their minds, there is an omni&s;cient and omnipre&s;ent Being, who cannot be deceived or impo&s;ed upon; and it is impo&s;&s;ible to invalidate that invariable ob|ligation to live under the power of the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, however they may endeavour to find means, by profe&s;&s;ing his name without taking up a cro&s;s, to the inordinate plea&s;ures and pur&s;uits of this world, or attribute to them&s;elves the merits of his death, without a death unto &s;in, and a new|birth unto righteou&s;ne&s;s, wherein alone we are made partakers of an everla&s;ting glory.</P>
<P>I be&s;eech you by the mo&s;t powerful motive of the grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that every one may endeavour to cultivate in your minds a li|ving &s;en&s;e of religion; and that we may all experi|ence the purity and &s;anctity of its nature to operate in our hearts; and, as members of one family, though di&s;tingui&s;hed by various names, we may continue as brethren and fellow-pilgrims, in our

its &s;imilitude.&mdash;And while the body is terre&s;tial, the glory will remain terre&s;tial, however it may a&s;&s;ume to matters of a higher nature, and &s;uperi|or importance.&mdash;Yet while the glory is earthly, our views earthly, and confined to the plea&s;ures and pur&s;uits of this world, our affections are earthly, and we are rendered incapable of that love, which is of a divine and heavenly nature.</P>
<P>A terre&s;tial love pre&s;ides and is prevalent in the minds of many; which has ob&s;tructed the power of truth, and been the cau&s;e of feeble purpo&s;es and feeble efforts, enfeebled minds with irre&s;olute in|tentions, and proved the occa&s;ion of a defection among&s;t chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ors, who have been de&s;i|rous to form &s;omething more amiable and agreea|ble, or better adapted to their natural inclinations. &mdash;But there is a deficiency in their love, a wavering in affection, a divi&s;ion of love, which is the cau&s;e of weakne&s;s and incapacity, to make a proper ad|vancement in a chri&s;tian life, or improvement in the progre&s;&s;ive work of religion upon the &s;oul. For, as I have hinted, while the body is terre&s;tial, the glory is terre&s;tial, until we are created anew in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, unto righteou&s;ne&s;s; wherein our minds will become cloathed with a cele&s;tial glory, and by the power of divine grace, be &s;et above every earthly love: and then the love of God will prevail in our minds, and we &s;hall attain an expe|rience

<P>But it is a deficiency of love, it is a cleaving to other things, incon&s;i&s;tent with the purity of the divine nature, that has &s;lain ten thou&s;ands!&mdash;A &s;e|cret defection of heart, which no human eye hath been privy to, has &s;lain more than open prophanity! &mdash;A degeneracy of heart, a &s;ecret &s;liding from the covenant of life, in tho&s;e who are turning a&s;ide in|to the path of irreligion, and a mental deviation from the purity of nature, and holine&s;s; the ne|ce&s;&s;ary requi&s;ite to an union and divine participati|on in the love of God.</P>
<P>I think it is &s;aid with very great propriety, that "The love of money is the root of all evil; which while &s;ome have lu&s;ted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced them&s;elves through with many &s;orrows<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. vi. 10.</NOTE>." &mdash;But though it may &s;eem to many not needful to tell of the&s;e things, methinks it is applicable to &s;ome in the&s;e days who would be deemed "men of God;"

<P>WHEN that great and eminent in&s;trument, the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The apo&s;tle Paul.</NOTE> apo&s;tle of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, had &s;ucce&s;sfully laboured in planting the chri&s;tian churches, he left a caution to tho&s;e among&s;t whom he had laboured, which retains its force and validi|ty throughout all the ages of the militant church; among&s;t all people of all names, but in a particular manner, to tho&s;e who profe&s;s the name of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and a hope of &s;alvation by him. Be not deceived (he proceeds further to evince the nece&s;&s;ity of this caution) God is not mocked! &s;uch as every man &s;ows, &s;uch &s;hall he reap: if he &s;ow

<P>I have no &s;ort of doubt of this caution being from divine in&s;piration, recorded as a la&s;ting watch|word to all that would run &s;o as to obtain, and per&s;evere without fainting, to a peaceful and happy conclu&s;ion; and I apprehend it is not either un&s;ea|&s;onable, or out of the line of my pre&s;ent duty, to renew the caution to each individual within the au|dience of my voice; ina&s;much as he that betrays and deceives, is now ranked under the character of a liar and murderer from the beginning <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">John viii. 44.&mdash;</NOTE>, exerci&s;ing tho&s;e de&s;tructive offices upon the unguar|ded, unwatchful, and deceived mind: for even where the fountain of light and under&s;tanding hath been opened to a di&s;covery of tho&s;e things e&s;&s;ential|ly nece&s;&s;ary to &s;alvation, there he hath not been wanting to pre&s;ent him&s;elf, among&s;t tho&s;e &s;ons of God <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Job 1.6.</NOTE>, the immediate production of his enlighten|ing and enlivening power.

<P>He has &s;ugge&s;ted, and been too &s;ucce&s;sful in the &s;ugge&s;tion, that there is no &s;uperior power to whom we are accountable, adapted to the de&s;ires of &s;ome who would gladly have him dive&s;ted of tho&s;e attri|butes which are painful to their view; and here the enemy has been too much &s;uffered to prevail with &s;ome unhappy minds, to depart from the joy|ous, light&s;ome, plea&s;ant and delightful paths of true chri&s;tianity and godline&s;s, into the devious paths of error and deception: and to be &s;u&s;tained in that unhappy &s;tate, I confe&s;s appears to me, a compendium of mi&s;ery without hope, and without God in the world; but as it is productive of pre|&s;ent ea&s;e, they have lo&s;t &s;ight of future happine&s;s; as it propo&s;es immediate gratification, and pre&s;ents

<P>I would gladly hope there are not many, if there are any, of the number (within the audience of my voice) of tho&s;e fools, who have &s;aid in their heart "There is no God;" that have &s;o far &s;uffer|ed them&s;elves to be drawn into the power of decepti|on, as to &s;ay or to think, or even imagine, that there is no fir&s;t moving cau&s;e, no re&s;t for their feet, nor God, the Lord of all the world; but it is evi|dently the production of a delu&s;ive &s;pirit, who attempts to in&s;inuate a di&s;belief in the reality of a divine exi&s;tence. All creation proclaims a God, and pre&s;ents &s;uch a te&s;timony to man, as renders it impo&s;&s;ible to he&s;itate in point of belief, that &s;uch a being exi&s;ts, who&s;e power and goodne&s;s is eminent|ly di&s;played throughout the whole extent of his creation; and notwith&s;tanding this acknowledgment, there is a nece&s;&s;ity to caution &s;ome not to be deceiv|ed, who though they own a &s;uperintendency, and care over the works of God in the external creation, yet, &s;uch is their gro&s;s infatuation, as to deny that certain providential regard and care over the far nobler part of the vi&s;ible creation, his creature man.

They proceed even &s;o far as to acknowledge the circulation of the &s;ea&s;ons, the productions of the earth, with a variety of external parts of created nature, to proceed from the fixed appointment of infinite wi&s;dom, and are &s;upported by an almighty hand; but yet are unwilling to admit the certainty of his immediate providence, care, and regard towards that con&s;tituent part, the human creation; which is of infinitely greater importance than tho&s;e tabernacles of clay which are but for a &s;ea&s;on, and in the cour&s;e of nature cea&s;e to exi&s;t. This has been one of the effects of gro&s;s deception, impo&s;ed upon the under&s;tandings of mankind, and which an unwearied enemy has from age to age endeavoured to propagate upon the earth, thereby to withdraw the &s;oul from the &s;ource of true happine&s;s, wherein it might be enabled to re&s;i&s;t every evil in&s;tigation, which may be laid to en&s;nare the unguarded mind.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome, who, though they acknow|ledge the glory of his providence, propounded and proclaimed in the external manife&s;tations of his greatne&s;s and goodne&s;s, but yet are not &s;ufficiently convinced, not &s;ufficiently appri&s;ed, or willing to admit the grace of God, or his divine and powerful word, as nece&s;&s;ary to influence their conduct, and pre&s;ide over the will of man in its &s;piritual race towards everla&s;ting glory. They are ready to applaud the &s;ufficiency of human rea&s;on,

the faculties of rea&s;on and rational powers, which infinite wi&s;dom has &s;een meet to give us for govern|ment and direction, with regard to things &s;imply pertaining to the moral rectitude of our conduct in the common concerns of this life, and where divine bounty has &s;een nece&s;&s;ary, for the promotion of his own glory, and the happine&s;s of his creatures, to provide a further a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the exerci&s;e of tho&s;e faculties and rea&s;oning powers, which the creator of mankind &s;ees meet in mercy to &s;avour us with for our advancement; and by which alone we are made capable of an admi&s;&s;ion into the kingdom of God.</P>
<P>"Be not deceived."</P>
<P>But there has been a lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by all people, of all names and di&s;tinctions, to religion, who have endeavoured to intrench them&s;elves within an imaginary &s;ecurity, within the bounds of natural powers and natural religion, and the exerci&s;e of tho&s;e rea&s;oning faculties of their own minds: there has been rea&s;on fixed with the command|ments; and, the laws of nature maintained as a &s;ufficient guide in our religious duties.</P>
<P>It is a partial leaning to our own under&s;tandings, thus to advocate our own cau&s;e from the rea&s;oning

faculties of the human mind, una&s;&s;i&s;ted by that enli|vening efficacious principle of light and truth, derived from the grace and love of God, which is of a higher nature, and of far greater excellence than all the powers of rea&s;on; and would open upon the view of the attentive mind, tho&s;e divine e&s;&s;en|tial truths which it is impo&s;&s;ible for the ab&s;tracted rational faculties to penetrate into. It is by the light of grace, we di&s;cover the nece&s;&s;ity, the ab&s;o|lute nece&s;&s;ity of a daily communion with the God of our lives, a walking in holine&s;s and purity, in &s;elf-denial, that we take up the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t and follow him in the regeneration <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. xix. 28.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>"Be ye holy, for I the Lord your God am holy," has been the language of that unchangeable eternal God, by virtue of which alone we are capa|ble of laying up a good foundation again&s;t the time to come, by laying hold on tho&s;e durable riches, the provi&s;ion of God for the faithful, far beyond every temporal acqui&s;ition, whereby we are admit|ted into that within the veil, being redeemed from all corrupt inclinations and undue affections, with|drawn from the world, and engaged to concur in that invariable proclamation evidenced in every heart, in every mind, and in the thought of all, the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of holine&s;s, without which no man can &s;ee the Lord to his comfort: it has called &s;ons from far and daughters from the ends of the

earth, from under the power of deception, to di&s;cern the nece&s;&s;ity of thus coming out of the arms of &s;elf-love, &s;elf-will, the partial approbation of deluded minds, whence many have been led into a per&s;ua&s;ion of the &s;ufficiency of human rea&s;on; they would have more liberty than the &s;traight gate and narrow way will admit of; in this, "have me excu&s;ed," has been the frequent language of many, and a cau&s;e of departing from the con&s;ecrated paths of holine&s;s, and whereby many have deviated from a circum&s;cribed walking in the paths which lead to the beautiful realms of light, and to an inheritance with the family of God, who&s;e infinite and unboun|ded love is diffu&s;ed throughout every part of his triumphant church; and extended to his militant on earth, for he would &s;till beautify the place of his &s;anctuary within the glorious realms of everla&s;ting day, "the habitation of his holine&s;s, and the city where his honour dwells."</P>
<P>"Be not deceived."</P>
<P>Let not the minds of any profe&s;&s;ing the chri&s;tian name be deceived by the partial repre&s;entation of natural affection and natural choice, a love of ea&s;e, or the plea&s;ing pro&s;pects of temporal enjoyments, for that which is born of the fle&s;h is fle&s;h, and is ter|re&s;trial, there is a glory terre&s;trial and a cele&s;tial glory, but the terre&s;trial glory is apt to withdraw

the incautious mind into a vi&s;ionary dependence upon earthly, and uncertain happine&s;s; which de|prives of a portion in the glory cele&s;tial. And there is made, in the provi&s;ion of God, an ample &s;ufficiency for us completely to attain a right in the &s;piritual creation of his &s;on on this &s;ide eternity; and by which we now can &s;ay, "The Lord is with me," becau&s;e he is at my right hand, therefore I &s;hall not be moved.</P>
<P>It is the &s;ufficiency we receive from his divine aid and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, whereby I am enabled to guide my &s;teps con&s;i&s;tent with his holy will; let us then confe&s;s with the apo&s;tle, I know that in me, that is in my fle&s;h, dwelleth no good thing. We ought ever to acknowledge, O Lord, righteou&s;ne&s;s be|longeth to thee, but unto us blu&s;hing and confu&s;ion of face! &mdash; There is a gra|dation from the lowe&s;t order of animated creation; for as no man knows the things of a man, &s;ave the &s;pirit of a man that is in him, &s;o no man knows the things of God, but by the &s;pirit of God. As the fruit cannot with any propriety be good from a per|ver&s;e root, by deviating from the bounds pre&s;cri|bed by the former of heaven and earth, continued throughout the &s;uperior order of created beings, no more can we judge of divine matters by a mere knowledge derived from human power and the natural under&s;tanding faculties of our own

minds; but we mu&s;t enter into that within the veil; and be cloathed with a &s;uperior light and under&s;tanding, from that power which has brought life and immortality to light by the go&s;pel: there|fore let no man deceive you, be ye not deceived; for &s;uch as every man &s;ows, &s;uch &s;hall he reap.</P>
<P N="1">1. There is another &s;pecies of deception, that it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to apprize and warn you of, who profe&s;s the religion of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, under the various names and di&s;tinct profe&s;&s;ions we may make in the world, among&s;t tho&s;e who lay too much &s;tre&s;s upon their various profe&s;&s;ions, and up|on a belief of truth, by giving the bare a&s;&s;ent of our judgment to the te&s;timony of others; this has been a &s;pecies of impo&s;ition too much pur&s;ued and depen|ded upon, whereby names have pa&s;t for things, and a profe&s;&s;ion to religion has pa&s;t for religion it&s;elf; a rectitude of &s;entiment has often been deem|ed a &s;ufficient atonement for irregularity of life; but it is impo&s;&s;ible for us to adopt a life of religion, and yet retain a life to the world, as the chri&s;tian religion, which is of the highe&s;t authority and dignity, enforces the irreconcilable contrariety of the&s;e natures; but it is po&s;&s;ible to adopt a depen|dence upon notion and in tradition, and yet be utter &s;trangers to the life of true chri&s;tianity. I know not &s;carce a greater in&s;tance of deception among&s;t profe&s;&s;ors of the chri&s;tian name, than with tho&s;e
<PB N="212" REF="037439_0229_100D2F46592A2B50">
who would contend for orthodoxy of &s;y&s;tem, and &s;trenuou&s;ly &s;upport the &s;uperior importance of their own opinions, which has often proved a means of &s;tirring up hatred and per&s;ecution one towards another, and that under the &s;pecious pretext of be|ing "for Chri&s;t's &s;ake;" but it abundantly di&s;co|vers that all the powers of deception, hath &s;urroun|ded and fortified them in a dangerous &s;ecurity, which it is very difficult ever to be extricated from.</P>
<P>But let no man deceive you, or be ye not de|ceived; what &s;ignifies a per&s;ua&s;ion or a&s;&s;ent to truth, if we live not a life con&s;i&s;tent with the purity and holine&s;s of its nature, and corre&s;pondent with the precepts of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P N="2">2. If the mind was properly engaged to pur&s;ue the genuine effects of the &s;pirit of truth (a di&s;po&s;iti|on which ought ever to be prevalent and cultivated among&s;t us) we &s;hould then abundantly demon&s;trate a being born not of corruption, but of the incor|ruptable &s;eed, through the word of God, which liveth and abideth in you for ever, whereby we are made partakers in the e&s;&s;ential virtue of the chri&s;tian religion. It matters not to me by what name I am called, or however di&s;tingui&s;hed among&s;t men, if I am but admitted into a fellow|&s;hip with the church of the fir&s;t born; the provi&s;ion
<PB N="213" REF="037439_0230_100D44E8336516D8">
of God, for tho&s;e who are called by his &s;pirit, that are influenced and guided in wi&s;dom, and finally in|tended to be received into glory.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e two cla&s;&s;es &s;tands the bulk of the chri&s;tian world, and on the&s;e two natures depends the final deci&s;ive &s;entence of, Come ye ble&s;&s;ed, or Depart ye cur&s;ed.</P>
<P>To you that lay more &s;tre&s;s upon human inventi|ons, and orthodox &s;y&s;tems; who hold a reverence for names, and for external appearances, be not deceived; ina&s;much as the &s;pirit of true religion remains the &s;ame, under every name, it lives in every form, and is confined to none, being one in it&s;elf, unchangeable and powerful in its energy, &s;anctifying the &s;oul, and whereby the heart is made pure in the &s;ight of God; and then the fruits will be unto holine&s;s, and the end life everla&s;ting.</P>
<P>But there has been a lamentable deception pre|valent over the minds of many, who are dead to religion and religious impre&s;&s;ions: the&s;e would acknowledge and a&s;&s;ent with the tongue, though perhaps their judgment proceeded no farther than from the rea&s;oning faculties of their own minds, without regard to the powerful motives contained an that excellent de&s;cription of chri&s;tianity, or the efficacious tendency of it, With the heart man

believeth unto righteou&s;ne&s;s, and with the tongue, confe&s;&s;ion is made unto &s;alvation; for where a con|fe&s;&s;ion of the mouth is made, there is great need for a concurrence with the heart, from a feeling &s;en&s;e of the powerful principle and life of religion in the &s;oul.</P>
<P>"Be not deceived."</P>
<P>There is another &s;ort of people under all names and di&s;tinctions of religion, to whom al&s;o this cauti|on &s;eems exceedingly nece&s;&s;ary, and among&s;t whom the precepts of the go&s;pel have lo&s;t their force; the&s;e would imagine that the way to the kingdom of God is varied from that pre&s;cribed by the holy author of the chri&s;tian faith. It is a &s;trait and nar|row way; they would plead no po&s;&s;ibility of living up to truth, but pur&s;ue the general practice of mankind; and plead that, as truth it&s;elf is lo&s;t, it mu&s;t now be fetched from the land of general prac|tice, and the general conduct of them&s;elves and others: but God is unchangeable in his nature, and his relative attributes remain the &s;ame throughout every di&s;pen&s;ation of the world, and the foundation of God &s;tandeth independent of all deficiency (in whom is no variablene&s;s or &s;hadow of turning) of all the deceivable inventions of &s;uch &s;ons of formali|ty, and deceived &s;ouls in all ages, that have been unwilling to &s;ubmit to the inflexible law of the
<PB N="215" REF="037439_0232_100D44EC812BED40">
&s;pirit of life in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; the&s;e would endeavour to acquit them&s;elves with the more flexible law of general practice, and general conduct; varied ac|cording to their inclinations, indulging every &s;en|&s;uality, and &s;pending their time in the pur&s;uit of earthly plea&s;ures. The&s;e would build their expec|tations upon the merciful attributes of that being whom they offend: and neglect to con&s;ider that a time will come, when ju&s;tice as well as mercy, will be recompen&s;ed to every man according to his deeds, whether they be good or evil.</P>
<P>It is an endle&s;s commandment, and can never be abrogated; That the &s;oul that &s;ins &s;hall die, and remains over the heads of all mankind who yield them&s;elves to pre&s;ent plea&s;ures, and give up their minds to follow after lying vanities; who, neverthele&s;s would have a portion in the un&s;peaka|ble enjoyment of an endle&s;s futurity, and an admi&s;&s;i|on within the con&s;ecrated man&s;ions of eternal glory; but I would caution the&s;e not to be deceived, for God is not mocked, and we &s;hall certainly find it &s;o when every human aid, with the powers of deception, &s;hall di&s;appear; it will prove a fatal witne&s;s again&s;t all the plea&s;ing expectations of a deluded hope.</P>
<P>But &s;uch is the progre&s;s of the work of that liar and murderer, to introduce a concurrence of agree|ment,

with di&s;agreement into the affairs of provi|dence; that &s;ome have imagined he looks not with that vigilence towards the work of his hand, which revealed religion teaches us to expect from the pow|erful effects of his divine notice and regard, who&s;e mercy is great, or el&s;e we &s;hould not be able to &s;tand before him; but he is righteous as well as merciful, in all his ways, and will by no means &s;uffer uncleanne&s;s to enter his holy habitation, but will ha&s;ten the pu|ni&s;hment of guilt upon the impenitent &s;oul; and tho&s;e who obdurately proceed in a cour&s;e of deviati|on from their morning light, whereby they lo&s;e the capacity of di&s;tingui&s;hing betwixt light and darkne&s;s, or the di&s;agreement of happine&s;s and mi|&s;ery. The&s;e notwith&s;tanding would gladly look at the glorious light of heaven, and hope at large for an admi&s;&s;ion into the &s;acred man&s;ions of everla&s;ting day; but the purity of his nature will admit no uncleanne&s;s to enter his kingdom: all tho&s;e attri|butes of God, of ju&s;tice as well as mercy, remain immoveable, and fixed in the righteous appointment of unerring wi&s;dom; and therefore let no ob&s;tacle hinder our approaches before the throne of his holine&s;s, to render every attribute of prai&s;e to Him who&s;e infinite and adorable perfections, are emi|nently manife&s;ted in the uniform and glorious e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of his &s;acred church and family: therefore be not deceived by any of the powers of darkne&s;s, or led to rely upon the &s;trength of external per|formances,

<P>A SOLEMN &s;ummons which the Almigh|ty gave through his Prophet Joel, to a Peo|ple whom he had known above all the families of the earth, (at a time when they had revolted and departed in heart from him) has been revived in my mind; with an apprehen&s;ion that the &s;ame authority requires the republication of it in this day, to a people likewi&s;e highly favoured of him; and who have in like manner departed from their fir&s;t love.</P>

<P>As I am about to conclude (perhaps finally con|clude) my labours among&s;t you in this quarter; I would query with &s;ome, with many that are pre&s;ent, whether they have not heard intelligibly the &s;ound of the trumpet, calling them with a degree of cer|tainty, to ari&s;e and prepare them&s;elves for the bat|tle. My brethren and &s;i&s;ters, among&s;t whom I have been con&s;trained in the overflowings of the Father's love, to labour in a private capacity, breaking (I hope I may &s;ay) a little bread from hou&s;e to hou&s;e&mdash;the everla&s;ting Go&s;pel has been preached among&s;t you with all the force of pathetic energy, with all the tenderne&s;s of divine compa&s;&s;i|on; let it not be ineffectual!

me to think highly of my&s;elf, to exalt the officer, the mini&s;ter. I would not that you &s;hould hold any Man's per&s;on in high e&s;timation. I am deeply &s;en&s;ible that to me belongs "blu&s;hing and confu&s;i|on of face," but I magnify mine office, and the power of him who has &s;een meet to employ me therein; I would endeavour to exalt in our view the adorable goodne&s;s and conde&s;cen&s;ion of the great author of all mercies, in that he has cau&s;ed the trumpet to be renewedly founded in your bor|ders; hear its important me&s;&s;age with &s;uitable at|tention; let it rou&s;e and prepare all the ranks in the armies of our I&s;rael, to engage in the glorious cau&s;e of our God. Let the daughter of our Zion ari&s;e from the bed of Indolence; from the lethar|gic &s;tupor of a fatal forgetfulne&s;s; from all the deadning, benumbing gratifications of &s;en&s;uality, and &s;hake her&s;elf from the du&s;t of the earth, that &s;he may come up to the help of him who hath cal|led her with an high and holy calling.

<P>I am fully per&s;uaded that the gracious vi&s;itation of humbling melting goodne&s;s, has been afre&s;h extended to individuals pre&s;ent, in (I had almo&s;t

Let me, therefore, ten|derly intreat you, with all the warmth of unut|terable affection, as a brother, as a fellow pilgrim, through the vici&s;&s;itudes of time to the unmixed joys of a happy eternity, that you will no longer neglect the offers of mercy, or turn a deaf ear to the reproofs of In&s;truction. I feel my mind covered with that boundle&s;s Love, that wi&s;hes, that ardently de&s;ires, you may indeed be wi&s;e for your&s;elves: For although I may be deficient in many qualifications of a go&s;pel mini&s;ter, I am not wanting in that pure di&s;intere&s;ted love, which &s;eeks not yours but you. "Blow the trum|pet in Zion; &s;anctify a fa&s;t."

"We can do nothing again&s;t the truth, but for the truth <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. xiii 8.</NOTE>," was the lan|guage of &s;ome formerly, who had indeed &s;anctified an acceptable fa&s;t.

<HEAD>A DISCOURSE DELIVERED AT BRADFORD, THE 17TH DAY OF THE EIGHTH MONTH, 1770.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH there is (unhappily for them|&s;elves) a &s;pirit of di&s;&s;ipation and incredulity, with re&s;pect to matters of the highe&s;t importance, too vi&s;ibly prevalent in many minds; yet it is plea|&s;ing and comfortable to me to have rea&s;on to believe, that in many others an enquiry is rai&s;ed after the way to life and &s;alvation.</P>
<P>"O Lord, who &s;hall &s;hew us any good."</P>
<P>An enquiry worthy of being inculcated and adopt|ed with &s;incerity and impartiality; and I have no doubt of its being crowned with the de&s;ired &s;ucce&s;s to every hone&s;t and &s;incere queri&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="037439_0256_100D45208C48E9A8">I think the day in which we live, through the awakening virtue of divine mercy, furni&s;hes many in&s;tances or &s;ubjects like this which the Evangelical Prophet applied to, with the gracious invitation of the author and well &s;pring of all that is good, an invitation which has &s;ometimes warm'd me, and is affectionately rai&s;ed in my heart towards this a&s;&s;em|bly.</P>
<P>"Ho, every one that thir&s;teth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money, come ye buy and eat, yea come, buy wine and milk without mo|ney and without price. Wherefore do ye &s;pend your money for that which is not bread, and your la|bour for that which &s;atisfieth not: hearken dili|gently unto me, and eat that which is good, and let your &s;oul delight it&s;elf in fatne&s;s."</P>
<P>This is an invitation which may have little mean|ing or &s;ignificancy in it, to tho&s;e minds who are &s;trangers (unhappily &s;trangers) to the beginning of the &s;piritual creation of God, as forming and fa&s;hi|oning it&s;elf, in holine&s;s unto glory; but it is expre&s;|&s;ive, and intelligible, to &s;uch minds as have been happily de&s;irous of knowledge of him in whom they have profe&s;&s;ed to believe, and mea&s;urably witne&s;&s;ed the entrance of that &s;pirit as both light and life, which is ju&s;tly and pertinently called the "Quick|ening Spirit," for it is by the influence, the en|livening
<PB N="240" REF="037439_0257_100D4523C91F7EB8">
of this quickening &s;pirit, we mu&s;t be made (if we ever are made) living &s;ouls to God, initiated into, and built up in that life which is eternally happy.</P>
<P>We are incapable of either hunger or thir&s;t, but through the enlivening of this quickening &s;pirit. hunger and thir&s;t are acts appertaining to life. The dead have not tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations, who are naturally or &s;piritually dead. It was by the efficacious work of that holy "wind that bloweth where it li&s;teth," that the dead dry bones were drawn into a divine re&s;emblance, in the former &s;tate of mankind, and whereby they were brought together, and united to their re&s;pective places in the heavenly body, quickened, rai&s;ed, formed a living army to God: but it was an utter impo&s;&s;ibility for any power &s;hort of that "Creating divine power," to bring together tho&s;e dead dry bones: and indeed the &s;imilitude, I confe&s;s, &s;eems worthy of that wi&s;dom that deli|vered it. They were human bones, there was a degree of fitne&s;s in their form and con&s;truction; for member&s;hip and for a&s;&s;imilating one with ano|ther: but I conceive that notwith&s;tanding this inher|ent virtue or ability in the dead dry bones to a&s;&s;imi|late one with another, they had certainly lain till the con&s;ummation of all things, but for that &s;uper|natural breath or wind of divine power which rai&s;ed them unto life. And I freely own that I believe
<PB N="241" REF="037439_0258_100D45268DFC1FB8">
&s;omething of this nature hath attended the minds of many in tho&s;e days in which we live, that would be to them as the Quickening Spirit, the prin|cipal object in the rudiments of a divine life, and enable us to live in the obedience of an holy faith here, and to be rai&s;ed to the enjoyment of endle&s;s good hereafter. This is what I wi&s;h for all tho&s;e, who are on their way to an holy habitation, where the wicked cea&s;e from troubling, and the weary &s;oul enjoys eternal re&s;t.</P>
<P>And, as having received mercy and a degree of merciful experience from the author of my being, I find &s;ome engagement to point out &s;ome &s;teps which have produced the fir&s;t fruits of the &s;piritual creation of God, and what hath been the means of debilitating &s;ome in their race, or turning a&s;ide others from following the works of an unavailing profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>For, as I have &s;aid, I have no doubt that the pre&s;ent awakening upon many minds is of a divine nature: and it may be known whence it proceeds, its original may be traced by thus con&s;idering whe|ther it more abounds in heavenly de&s;ires, or in de&s;ires after the things of this life.</P>
<P>In the my&s;tery of ungodline&s;s there is a life that imitates the life of Chri&s;t, but it is a life that mu&s;t
<PB N="242" REF="037439_0259_100D45281C9571A0">
die if ever we live acceptably to God. It is a life re&s;ulting from &s;elf love and a love of this world, wherein the prince of the powers of the air bears rule in the children of di&s;obedience, that pre&s;ents its &s;imilitude and de&s;ires after heaven.</P>
<P>Let me die the death of the righteous. Let me flee from the wrath to come: Let me have an in|heritance in the kingdom of peace, world without end: This is a language uttered by many, though perhaps they continue in the gratification of corrupt nature, and con&s;equently have no part in that life, that incorruptable, undefiled life, which alone can obtain an inheritance in the kingdom of God. Fle&s;h and blood cannot inherit this kingdom and its life. The&s;e de&s;ires, the&s;e wi&s;hes after a &s;tate of happine&s;s, and de&s;ires after heaven, have frequent|ly, in many minds, proceeded from vitiated cor|rupted &s;elf, having built up a vi&s;ionary hope, and hence they have e&s;timated its &s;ucce&s;s, according to the warmth of de&s;ire after life, and a life in that "fle&s;h and blood which cannot inherit the kingdom of God."</P>
<P>I am very apprehen&s;ive too many have mi&s;taken this ardor of mind for the production of good, the kingdom of God, though in an un&s;anctified, uncon|verted &s;tate, and, in the warmth and &s;ervour of this fire they have kindled, the kingdom of heaven
<PB N="243" REF="037439_0260_100D4529A95A6D00">
hath &s;uffered a kind of violence; in this mi&s;taken &s;tate, wherein too many have endangered their pre|&s;ent and eternal happine&s;s; and in their &s;piritual race involved them&s;elves in this mo&s;t dangerous mi&s;take, by how much the more we may approach a re&s;emblance to religion, and are not in it; being amu&s;ed with an imitation of divine life, and at the &s;ame time not actuated by it. This is to con&s;titute the danger under which we live, to entertain de&s;ires after heaven, when not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of heavenly virtue.</P>
<P>"Let me be holy; let me die the death de&s;tin'd for me to die."</P>
<P>Thus heavenly de&s;ires take in the means as well as the end; "O Lord, prepare me for thy king|dom," let not thy hand &s;pare, nor thine eye pity, till judgment pa&s;s upon the Mount of Edom, E&s;au's fir&s;t production; turn thy hand upon me, purge away all my dro&s;s, take away all my &s;in, and refine as the reprobate &s;ilver.</P>
<P>As our de&s;ires are thus rai&s;ed after the fountain of divine life, the glorious and holy Quickener will ever draw to a &s;imilitude to its author; and de&s;ires after heaven, not merely for its &s;afety but for its purity, not merely as a place of exemption from pain, anxiety and &s;orrow, but as the habitation of

&s;anctified and holy &s;pirits. Now this is to bring re|ligion and religious labour where it ought to exi&s;t, from the vi&s;ion of the head to the feeling emotions of the heart; it lays the axe to the root of every &s;u|perficial branch. The axe is laid to the root of the tree, and even tree that bringeth forth not good fruit is hewn down and ca&s;t into the fire; and the virtue of this divine invitation is diffu&s;ed and pro|claimed througout all the powers of the &s;oul.</P>
<P>"Ho, every one that thir&s;teth," in whom this di|vine life has ari&s;en, that take in the glorious object, not only its end but the means that can lift up the heart with the hands to God in the heavens, in ar|dent &s;upplication, that he may refine, &s;anctify, and purge away their &s;ins; that he may wa&s;h them from all impurity, and by the a&s;&s;imilating virtue of di|vine grace, be re&s;tored to an union with the Holy Spirit. The&s;e are then enabled to &s;erve him in the beauty of holine&s;s and the newne&s;s of life.</P>
<P>"Ho, every one that thir&s;teth," every one in whom a thir&s;t has been rai&s;ed, and in whom a thir&s;t has ari&s;en, after the animating virtue of the Quik|ening Spirit, may you continue in an awful reverent &s;en&s;e of that goodne&s;s and mercy, that has thus vi&s;it|ed you, and cau&s;ed a &s;en&s;e of the want of that food, wherewith Chri&s;t feeds his flock, to take place in your hearts.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="037439_0262_100D452F7B300210">There are &s;ome people quite too high for religion; alas! &s;ome others think them&s;elves too low for re|ligion, in whom an anxious &s;olicitude is become depre&s;&s;ed with fear, and who are on the verge of de&s;pair, not &s;ufficiently con&s;idering the efficacious virtue of that power that would &s;anctify, and pre|pare, in affliction, for future glory and happine&s;s. Some are ready to lament their &s;ituation, and to adopt the&s;e mournful enquiries: <Q>What have I to do with religion?&mdash;Will God accept the labour of my hands for the man&s;ions of light and life?&mdash;I would endeavour with diligence to fill up the du|ties of my day; I would &s;eek the con&s;olation of my God, but it is forever hid from me.</Q> This has often been the language in&s;inuated by the grand deceiver and enemy of mankind's happine&s;s; for though our heavenly Father that cloaths the &s;ea&s;ons with variety, may diver&s;ify the day with affliction, he would yet draw us near to him&s;elf; and know, for thy encouragement, there is abundant acce&s;s, through the one glorious Mediator, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by whom we are admitted into that within the veil; his ears are open to our reque&s;ts, as to the cherubin and &s;eraphin with their holy, holy, holy, in the habitation of light and bli&s;s. He is the God and Father of us all, he that is their God, he is my God, he is thy God, thy Father, and thy Friend, from whom this proclamation of unbounded mercy is gone forth. "Ho, every one that thir&s;teth," every one in this divine life is rai&s;ed, come ye to

the waters, and he that hath no money come, buy and eat, buy wine and milk without money and without price."</P>
<P>As it is of divine original this life proceeds from, &s;o it mu&s;t be &s;omething adequate to its own nature that can &s;atisfy it, and an hunger after it, proceed|ing from the God of life, and a diffu&s;ion of his &s;pi|rit; and it is in the holy animating virtue of it we cry, Abba, Father! to Him that dwells in glory.</P>
<P>This is the divine life:&mdash;It is a life that will be &s;trength to the feeble, and refre&s;h the thir&s;ty &s;oul. This is the life that is properly called religion, and ever &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in the kingdom of the Almighty God, and Father of heaven and earth, and throughout the &s;piritual creation of his Son:&mdash;It is the &s;ame life that breaths to man in &s;ecret &s;orrow and complaint&mdash;it is in the fullne&s;s of the &s;ame that the loftie&s;t oblation of wor&s;hip a&s;cends to God on high, from all who are virtually united to his &s;anctified church, and fa|mily, both in heaven and earth. We may be di&s;|tingui&s;hed by various names, or different modes, with regard to circum&s;tantial points, but it is the animating life of Chri&s;t that lives through all form, and is one both in heaven and earth. It leads to it|&s;elf, to thir&s;t after it&s;elf, con&s;i&s;tent with its own na|ture. It has &s;een an end of all perfection in imagi|nary views of things, through the divine command|ment of God.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="037439_0264_100D4532CEB14E88">"I have &s;een an end of all perfection, but thy com|mandments are exceeding broad."</P>
<P>It is a life that cannot be &s;atisfied with any thing that this world can afford, neither can it be content with the mo&s;t &s;pecious profe&s;&s;ions of truth; it cannot be content with all the riches of a name, nor with the formality in which &s;ome take up their re&s;t.&mdash; It a&s;pires after &s;omething greater, &s;omething higher, that will remain when the elements &s;hall melt with fervent heat, and all things vi&s;ible will fade, when every &s;pecious pretence, or lofty profe&s;&s;ion, in which mankind unhappily place their confidence, will no longer avail: But it is through an uniform progre&s;s in a life of righteou&s;ne&s;s we are admitted to the ce|le&s;tial bankquet of divine love, and having obtained an entrance into the mo&s;t holy place, are enabled to offer the incen&s;e of wor&s;hip with the fir&s;t born among many generations in the life and love of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>There is a probability &s;ometimes of tho&s;e that have been mea&s;urably quickened and enlivened, who have received a portion of heavenly gift, that would qualify and prepare them for eternal life; there is a probability of the&s;e turning a&s;ide from the &s;pirit of life into the oldne&s;s of the letter, turning from a &s;teady progre&s;s in the knowledge of him in whom they have believed, into a dependence on exterior

rites and &s;hadowy performances, a figurative re&s;em|blance, or &s;omething they would gladly hope accept|able in the &s;ight of God.</P>
<P>I have &s;een in&s;tances in the cour&s;e of my life, of &s;ome who&s;e &s;ouls were once awakened to a de&s;ire after the animating virtue of divine life, as the alpha, or beginning of the &s;piritual creation of God; when de&s;ires were formed after heaven, and yet they have turned a&s;ide from an arduous, laborious, &s;teady following on their way; and, if I may be al|lowed the expre&s;&s;ion, have lo&s;t them&s;elves in the flowery fields of imagination: The&s;e are ready to think they have attained a &s;ufficient knowledge of religion and religious duties, and this knowledge has been &s;ub&s;tituted in&s;tead of practice, the mu&s;ing of the head to the vital &s;en&s;ations of the heart, a pro|fe&s;&s;ion without the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of practical virtue; the&s;e by &s;imilitude, may be &s;aid to be lo&s;t in the flowery fields of imagination; they have lo&s;t that light which hath graciou&s;ly vi&s;ited them, that holy &s;en&s;e of innocency which once adorned their minds, and in whom were opened a door of hope and divine con&s;olation to their thir&s;ty &s;ouls. Alas! that any &s;hould thus fall away from their eternal intere&s;t by continuing to neglect the duties of their day, who are intent and fixt in the notional part without the obedience of faith, and attention to the refre&s;hing virtue of&mdash;"The day &s;pringing from on high":&mdash;For as happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in the enjoyment of this e&s;&s;en|tial

good, may you &s;o follow on to know it, as fa&s;h|ioning you in every Chri&s;tian virtue, and be confirm|ed in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of divine and ardent charity: but beware of that knowledge which puffeth up, and tends not to edification: and may you endeavour to encrea&s;e in the &s;tability of wi&s;dom with knowledge, and to advance from glory to glory, and from one degree of faith to another, in a daily filial depend|ance upon Him, who is willing to &s;ave, and able to deliver to the utmo&s;t, all them that come unto God by Him.</P>
<P>The holy apo&s;tle was led to ob&s;erve the lamentable &s;tate of the Galatian churches, among&s;t whom he had laboured and been in&s;trumental to rai&s;e the fir&s;t fruits of divine vi&s;itation, wherein many had been quickened and rai&s;ed to a &s;en&s;e of life; and yet he expo&s;tulates with them after this manner, "O fool|i&s;h Galatians! who hath bewitched you, that ye &s;hould not obey the truth, before who&s;e eyes Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath been evidently &s;et forth crucified among you?" They, having begun in the Spirit, thought to be made perfect in the fle&s;h; but it is not by any acts which the fle&s;h is capable of performing, in the multiplicity of external &s;ervices propo&s;ed as the means of &s;alvation, that can perfect the &s;oul. It is here too many are &s;trangers to &s;piritual Chri&s;tianity, and are alienated from the &s;pring of divine know|ledge, which would ari&s;e in the dependant thir&s;ty &s;oul; that vi&s;its you oftener than the morning, and

<P>Hearing is not wor&s;hip: the labour of the voice &mdash;a multitude of words&mdash;are not wor&s;hip; the&s;e &s;imply cannot con&s;titute the e&s;&s;ential part of "di|vine &s;ervice:" for though we may pronounce all the truths recorded in holy writ, they cannot an&s;wer in us this &s;ecret cry, "Lord, Lord, prepare me for thy kingdom," they are in&s;ufficient to redeem us from the power of death, hell, and the grave; but the work of righteou&s;ne&s;s is deeper than any &s;uperficial form; it is higher than a mere profe&s;&s;ion, or a name even to the mo&s;t excellent truths that ever were uttered by man: What then is divine wor&s;hip? &s;ince it con&s;i&s;ts not in the labour of the tongue, nor proceeds from the head; but it is the &s;ecret a&s;pirations of the &s;oul to God in every humble and enlightened mind. I will pray with the Spirit, and with the under&s;tand|ing al&s;o, whether I u&s;e words, or no words, whether language fail, or whether it do not. We have oc|ca&s;ion for language in our mutual engagements, or conver&s;e one with another: but the Holy Infinite
<PB N="251" REF="037439_0268_100D453BEA4E1FB8">
Spirit, by one in&s;tinctive act of vi&s;ion, beholds all the various &s;tates and di&s;po&s;itions of mankind.&mdash; "I will look towards the holy temple," towards the habitations of HIM, who&s;e penetrating eye includes the mo&s;t &s;ecret thoughts and intents of every heart: I will look towards thy holy temple in this look, in this flame the mind is prepared to offer an accepta|ble &s;acrifice to God, the Lord of heaven, and the whole earth.</P>
<P>Beware of having begun in the Spirit, and fol|lowing the fle&s;hly performances of tho&s;e things which may pre&s;ent them&s;elves as a re&s;emblance of religious duties. Be what you are, not by a form, or profe&s;&s;ion, or any contrivance of mankind; but be what you are by the grace of God, and then I make no doubt but a thir&s;t will then prevail, and "ble&s;&s;ed are they that hunger and thir&s;t after righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, for they &s;hall be filled." This ble&s;&s;ing was pronounced by Him that never failed nor ever will, in the performance of the covenant he has made.</P>
<P>"Ble&s;&s;ed are they which hunger and thir&s;t after righteou&s;ne&s;s." As heavenly de&s;ires are rai&s;ed after that food that would &s;atisfy the &s;oul, it is thus the mind is repleni&s;hed with the virtue of divine life; for "ble&s;&s;ed are they which hunger and thir&s;t after righteou&s;ne&s;s, for they &s;hall be filled."

of mankind more and more univer&s;ally, to &s;upply the hunger of &s;uch who may have refu&s;ed comfort, and the&s;e he would &s;atisfy with the good things of eternal life.</P>
<P>But there are who &s;ub&s;titute a &s;imilitude in&s;tead of practical virtue, and to tho&s;e appears applicable the my&s;terious meaning of that expre&s;&s;ion, which was formerly the language of the church, as cultivated on the mind, "I charge you, O ye daughters of Jeru&s;alem, by the hinds, and by the roes of the field, that ye &s;tir not up, nor awake my Love until he plea&s;e;" Or, as in better words, and more properly expre&s;&s;ed: "I charge you, O ye daughters of Jeru|&s;alem, that ye &s;tir not up nor awake my Love, by the hinds, or by the roes of the field, until He plea&s;e." The&s;e are the light-footed imaginations, in which, perhaps, the mind may be in &s;ome mea|&s;ure animated, and &s;tirred up to duty, but have wandered into the mountains of vi&s;ion, and there very frequently exerci&s;e them&s;elves in acts of &s;u|perficial devotion, the &s;trict ob&s;ervation of exterior forms, and by this means are al&s;o lo&s;t in the "fields of imagination;" they loo&s;e the capacity of di&s;tin|gui&s;hing betwixt that which is of a divine and hea|venly nature, and the effects of an un&s;table mind: betwixt that univer&s;al righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, and a life in the various amu&s;ements of time; the&s;e are as the hinds and the roes of the field, and are not

<P>O the riches of divine grace, that has thus abun|dantly favoured and ble&s;&s;ed us with the cele&s;tial dew, which is of the bounteous mercy of "Our Fa|ther that is in heaven," without money and without price! we have no equivalent wherewith to return the infinite obligation, we have none to plead with or depend upon, no claim of merit to avail our&s;elves of, but upon him that &s;heweth mercy; with this con&s;ideration we have no righteou&s;ne&s;s but of Him, no &s;trength but in his &s;trength; neither might nor wi&s;dom but of Him, let him that glorieth therefore glory in this, that he that &s;heweth mercy hath im|parted ability to perform the duties required at their hands.</P>
<P>And as there is no equivalent, in the returns of gratitude and thankful reverence, for all the glori|ous benefits we receive in the "light of his counte|nance," and thus having no adequate &s;trength of our own, may our continual dependence be on "The rock of &s;trength," the &s;upport and help of His people.</P>

It is to Thee who&s;e name we cannot &s;peak, who&s;e prai&s;e angels cannot &s;ufficiently celebrate; it is to Thee whom none can comprehend to the full, the glories of thy name, we lift up our hearts with our hands in the &s;olemn act of humble wor|wip, intreating that we may acceptably &s;peak there|of, and a&s;cribe the prai&s;e to Thee: "for thine is the kingdom, the Power and the glory, for ever|more." Amen.</P>
