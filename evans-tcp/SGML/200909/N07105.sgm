<HEAD><HI>SECTION I.</HI> Of the Preparatives to Family Duties.</HEAD>
<P>_NOW that we may more comfortably carry on the&s;e Family Duties, ob&s;erve we, 1. Our Entrance into them, and 2. Our Proceedings in them.</P>
<P N="1">1. For Entrance, we mu&s;t lay a good Foundation for Tractablene&s;s unto Religion in tho&s;e that belong to the Family.</P>
<P>As, 1. In the Governour. 2. In the Governed.</P>
<P N="1">1. In the Governour; who&s;e Duty it is,</P>
<P N="1">1. To endeavour in a &s;pecial Manner for Know|ledge in God's Word; and for Holine&s;s of Conver&s;a|tion in a Chri&s;tian Walking. This would tend much to the Pre&s;ervation of his Authority; who other|wi&s;e will be &s;lighted and di&s;regarded, through an apt|ne&s;s in Inferiours to take Occa&s;ion therefrom.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>To marry in the Lord;</HI> and then to live cha&s;tely in Wedlock, that there may be a holy Seed: Now that he may <HI>marry in the Lord,</HI> 1. Let Piety be the mover of his Affection; and Per&s;onage, Parentage, &amp; Portion, be only as a comfortable acce&s;&s;ary, con&s;iderable in a

&s;econd Place: Chri&s;tianity and Grace, is the chief golden Link and noble Tie, which hath the Power and Priviledge to make Marriage a lovely and ever|la&s;ting Bond. 2. Let him ply the Throne of Grace with fervency of Prayer: A good Wife is a more immediate Gift of God. Whence <HI>Solomon</HI> could &s;ay, <HI>Hou&s;es and Riches are the Inheritance of Fathers; but a prudent Wife is from the Lord:</HI> Such a rare and pre|cious Jewel is to be &s;ued and &s;ought for at God's Mercy Seat, with extraordinary Importunity &amp; Zeal; and it &s;he be procured at God's Hand by Prayer, he &s;hall find a thou&s;and Times more Sweetne&s;s and Comfort, then if &s;he be ca&s;t on him by an ordinary Providence. 3. Let him ob&s;erve and mark the&s;e &s;ix Points in his Choice: As, 1. The Report: 2. The Looks: 3. The Speech: 4. The Apparel: 5. The Companions: 6. The Education: The&s;e are like the Pul&s;es; that &s;hew the fitne&s;s and goodline&s;s of any Party with whom he ought to marry.</P>
<P N="3">3. To beware whom he admits to dwell with him; that they be tractable unto religious Cour&s;es. See <HI>David's</HI> Re&s;olution herein: <HI>Mine Eye &s;hall be upon the faithful of the Land, that they may dwell with me: He that walketh in a perfect Way &s;hall &s;erve me: He that worketh Deceit &s;hall not dwell within my Hou&s;e: He that telleth Lies, &s;hall not tarry in my Sight.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. In the Governed; who&s;e Duty it is both to join together in the Performance of <HI>Family Duties</HI> with their Governour, and to &s;ubmit to his Government: <HI>My Son, here the In&s;truction of thy Father, and for&s;ake not the Law of thy Mother; for they &s;hall be an Ornament of Grace unto thy Head, and Chains about thy Neck.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION II.</HI> Of the Duties of Governours in general.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Proceedings of the&s;e <HI>Family Duties,</HI> we are to con&s;ider the Duties, 1. Of the Governours. 2. Of the Governed.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Governours; if (as it is in Marriage) there be more than one; as fir&s;t, the chief Gover|nour, viz. the Hu&s;band: &s;econdly, the Helper, viz. the Wife; both the&s;e owe Duties to their Families, and Duties to one another.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Duties they owe to their Families, are either, In general to the whole; or, in particular, according to their &s;everal Relations.</P>
<P N="1">1. That which in general they owe to the whole Family, is either, to their Bodies, or to their Souls.</P>
<P N="1">1. To their Bodies: Concerning which, &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, <HI>He that provideth not for his own, and e&s;pecially for tho&s;e of his own Hou&s;e, he hath denied the Faith, and is wor&s;e than an Infidel.</HI> 1 Tim. 5.8. Now as the Spirit of God chargeth us with this Duty, &s;o he &s;etteth us about &s;uch Things whereby this may be compa&s;&s;ed; as, 1. That every one &s;hould have &s;ome hone&s;t and good Calling, and walk diligently in it: <HI>Let him that &s;tole, &s;teal no more,</HI> (&s;aith the Apo&s;tle, Eph. 4.28.) <HI>but rather let him labour, working with his Hands the Thing which is good.</HI> 2. That he bear a low Sail, and keep within Compa&s;s; remembring that of <HI>Solomon; He that is de&s;pi&s;ed, and hath a Servant, is better than he that ho|noureth him&s;elf, and lacketh Bread.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. To their Souls: Concerning which, &s;ome <HI>Du|ties,</HI> they are to perform to the Family; and others, to require of the Family.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Duties</HI> they mu&s;t perform to them, are&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. To provide that they may live under the publick Mini&s;try; for otherwi&s;e how &s;hould they be brought
<PB N="6" REF="009051_0005_10306F6EE092C2A8">
into the Sheepfold of Chri&s;t, if they hear not the Voice of the chief Shepherd &s;peaking unto them by tho&s;e whom he hath &s;ent?</P>
<P N="2">2. To over&s;ee the Ways of their Families; that they &s;erve God: and as in all other Duties, &s;o e&s;pe|cially in &s;anctifying the Sabbath: To this the very Words in the fourth Commandment do bind all Ma&s;ters of Families: <HI>Remember, thou and thy Son, and thy Daughter, thy Man-Servant, and thy Maid;</HI> &mdash; Where the Lord &s;peaks by Name to the Governours, as if he would make them Over&s;eers of this Work of &s;anctifying his Sabbaths.</P>
<P N="3">3. To &s;et their Hou&s;e in order for the Service of God, to offer Prayers &amp; Prai&s;es to the Lord Morning and Evening. To this Purpo&s;e, <HI>Pray continually</HI> (&s;aith the Apo&s;tle) 1 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 5.17. which we mu&s;t not un|der&s;tand of uninterrupted and ince&s;&s;ant pouring out of Prayers, as the <HI>Mu&s;&s;alians</HI> or <HI>Euchitae</HI> did; but of Morning and Evening Prayers; the Apo&s;tle here &s;peaking in Reference and in Analogy to the conti|nual, or daily Sacrifices. This was <HI>David</HI>'s Practice, <HI>Evening and Morning, and at Noon will I pray and cry aloud, and he &s;hall hear my Voice,</HI> P&s;al. 55.17. And this was <HI>Job</HI>'s Practice, who &s;ent for, and &s;anctified his Sons and Daughters; <HI>and ro&s;e up early in the Morning, and offered Burnt-offerings according to the Number of them all:&mdash;Thus did</HI> Job <HI>continually,</HI> Job 1.5. And this was <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Practice wherever he came, <HI>to build an Altar to God,</HI> where God &s;hould be wor&s;hipped jointly by turn and his Family: <HI>Gen.</HI> 12.7. &amp; 13.4. &amp; 21.33. And this was Chri&s;t's Practice for <HI>him&s;elf and his Fa|mily,</HI> Mat. 14.19. <HI>Joh</HI> 17.1.</P>
<P N="4">4. To in&s;truct their Families privately in Matters of Religion, that they may not only profe&s;s, but feel the Power of Religion in their Lives and Conver&s;a|tions. This <HI>Duty</HI> hath the&s;e Specials belonging to it.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="7" REF="009051_0006_10306F709B5BB920">1. A familiar Catechizing of them in the Princi|ples of Religion. Thus were Parents commanded of old; <HI>Thou &s;halt teach the&s;e Words diligently unto thy Children, and &s;halt talk of them when thou &s;ette&s;t in thine Hou&s;e, and when thou walke&s;t by the Way, and when thou lie&s;t down, and when thou ri&s;e&s;t up.</HI> Deut. 6.7. Prov. 22.6.</P>
<P N="2">2. A daily reading of the Scriptures in their hear|ing, directing them to mark and to make U&s;e of them: So <HI>Timothy</HI> was trained up by his Parents, and that <HI>from his Childhood,</HI> 1 Tim. 3.15.</P>
<P N="3">3. A careful endeavouring that they may profit by the publick Mini&s;try: To this end: 1 They mu&s;t prepare them to hear the Word, by con&s;idering God's Ordinances, Promi&s;es, and their own Nece&s;&s;ities. 2. They mu&s;t remember them to look in the Word for a Chri&s;t, and for Communion with him. 3. They mu&s;t examine them after the Ordinances, what they have learned, and what U&s;e they make of it: Thus Chri&s;t, after he had preached a Parable to his Di&s;ciples, he &s;aid unto them, <HI>Know you not this Para|ble, and how then will you know all Parables?</HI> and then he expounds the Parable to them. <HI>Mark</HI> 4.13.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Duties</HI> they are to require of the Family, are both carefully to frequent the public Mini&s;try, and diligenly to be conver&s;ant in the private Wor&s;hip of God, and con&s;tantly to practice all holy and Chri&s;tian <HI>Duties</HI> compri&s;ed briefly in the Command|ments of God; and they are to require the&s;e Things, not only by telling them, calling on them, catechi|zing them, admoni&s;hing them; but if they be neg|ligent, by correcting them.</P>
<P>Now this Correction mu&s;t be mini&s;tred both in <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> and in <HI>Patience.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>In Wi&s;dom;</HI> who&s;e Property it is to find out the right Party that committed the Fault, to con&s;ider of what Sort and Nature, the Fault is, to weigh Cir|cum&s;tances of Age, Di&s;cretion and Occa&s;ions; and
<PB N="8" REF="009051_0007_10306F73C1E2BE08">
to look to the Mind of the Doer, whether Negli|gence or meer Simplicity brought him to it.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>In Patience;</HI> who&s;e Property it is to make the Fault manife&s;t to the Offender, that his Con&s;cience may be touched therewith; to hear what the Offen|der can &s;ay in his own Defence, and accordingly to allow or di&s;allow; to avoid Bitterne&s;s, which &s;ooner will harden the Heart, then reform the Manners of the Offender: The&s;e Rules being ob&s;erved, and the Heart lifted up in Prayer to God for Direction and ble&s;&s;ing, this <HI>Correction</HI> is nece&s;&s;ary; as is evident in <HI>Gen.</HI> 30.2. <HI>Prov.</HI> 13.24. and 19.18.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the <HI>Duties</HI> that <HI>Governours</HI> owe to their <HI>Families</HI> in re&s;pect of their Souls; to <HI>correct them, catechize them, admoni&s;h them, call on them, read to them, pray for them, &amp;c.</HI> only with the&s;e Limitations.</P>
<P N="1">1. That they pre&s;ume not above their Callings: This was <HI>Paul</HI>'s Exhortation, <HI>That no Man take this Honour to him&s;elf, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron:</HI> The <HI>Honour</HI> here, is the <HI>Honour</HI> of the publick Mini&s;try; except that, and I know not but that every Governour of a Family, who hath &s;pecial Abilities, Utterance, Memory, may read Scriptures, repeat Sermons, pray, teach and in&s;truct out of the the Scriptures. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 4.10. Thus <HI>Jacob</HI> &s;aid to his Hou&s;hold, <HI>Put away the &s;trange Gods that are among you.</HI> Gen. 35.2. <HI>And without all Contradiction</HI> (&s;aith the Apo&s;tle) <HI>the le&s;s is ble&s;&s;ed of the better,</HI> Heb. 7.7. <HI>And if the Woman would learn any Thing, let them a&s;k their Hu&s;|bands at Home,</HI> 1 Cor. 14.35. Thus <HI>Origen</HI> would have the Word expounded in Chri&s;tian Families: and <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> &s;aith, <HI>That which the Preacher is in the Pulpit, the &s;ame is the Hou&s;holder in the Hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That they pre&s;ume not above their Gifts: This was <HI>Paul</HI>'s Exhortation to every Man, <HI>Not to think of him&s;elf more highly then he ought to think; but to think &s;o|berly, as God hath dealt to every Man the Mea&s;ure of
<PB N="9" REF="009051_0008_10306F7674B583D8">
Faith;</HI> yet I deny not but in &s;ome Ca&s;es they may lawfully depute or &s;ub&s;titute &s;ome one in the Family, whom they judge fitte&s;t unto the Service and Em|ployment, which they them&s;elves &s;hould ordinarily perform: as in Ca&s;e of old Age and weakne&s;s of Body: <HI>Thus Samuel being old, made his Sons Judges:</HI> Or in want of good Utterance or Expre&s;&s;ion of what is to be &s;aid: Thus <HI>Aaron</HI> was <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> his Spoke&s;man, and in &s;tead of a Mouth: or in want of Boldne&s;s and Audacity, ari&s;ing from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of Weakne&s;s: Thus the good Centurion &s;ent the Elders of the Jews to Chri&s;t to intercede for him: or in Ca&s;e that a Mi|ni&s;ter of the Go&s;pel do &s;ojourn in ones Family, as <HI>Ar|chippus</HI> did in <HI>Philemon</HI> his Hou&s;e: or in Ca&s;e of ne|ce&s;&s;ary Ab&s;ence: Thus the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> made <HI>Timo|thy</HI> his Deputy to the Chri&s;tian <HI>The&s;&s;alonians:</HI> Or in Ca&s;e the Lord hath be&s;towed more of his Gifts and Graces to one than another: I know not in this Ca&s;e, but that we may <HI>covet earne&s;tly the be&s;t Gifts in others, as well as in our own &s;elves.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION III.</HI> Of the Duties of Parents to their Children.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Duties</HI> in particular which <HI>Governours</HI> owe to the <HI>Family,</HI> according to their <HI>Relations,</HI> are either</P>
<P>As Parents to their Children: Or, as Ma&s;ters to their Servants.</P>
<P>The <HI>Duties</HI> of <HI>Parents</HI> to their Children, are either to their Bodies, or to their Souls.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Duties</HI> of Parents to the <HI>Bodies</HI> of their Chil|dren, are in many Particulars, but may be all com|prized under this one Head, <HI>A provident Care for their temporal Good;</HI> and this extendeth it &s;elf to all Times, as 1. To their Infancy. 2. To their Youth. 3. To the Time of Parents Departure out of this World.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="10" REF="009051_0009_10306F7BA4139C68">1. The fir&s;t Age of a Child is his Infancy, and the fir&s;t Part of its Infancy, is while it remaineth in the Mother's Womb. Here the <HI>Duty</HI> lies principally upon the Mother, to have a &s;pecial Care of it, that it may be &s;afely brought forth. Why was the Charge of <HI>ab&s;taining from Wine, &s;trong Drink, and unclean Things,</HI> given to <HI>Manoah's</HI> Wife, but becau&s;e <HI>of the Child which &s;he had conceived?</HI></P>
<P>The next Degree of a Child's Infancy, is while it is in the Swadling-band, and remains a &s;ucking Child; in this al&s;o the Care more e&s;pecially lies on the Mother, who&s;e <HI>Duty</HI> it is to take all the pains &s;he po&s;&s;ibly may, for the Education of her Child; and e&s;pecially to give her Child &s;uck, if &s;he be able thereto: This not only Nature, but Scripture &s;ets forth;</P>
<P N="1">1. By Con&s;equence, <HI>Gen.</HI> 49.25. <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 9.14. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.10.</P>
<P N="2">2. By Example, <HI>Gen.</HI> 21.7. 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 1.23. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 22 9.</P>
<P N="3">3. By Grant, the Word giving it as a ruled Ca&s;e not to be denied, <HI>Gen.</HI> 21.7. <HI>Cant.</HI> 8.1. <HI>Luk.</HI> 11.27.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;econd Age of a Child is its Youth, from the Time it begins to be of any Di&s;cretion, till it be fit to be placed forth: Now the <HI>Duty</HI> of Parents at this Time is,</P>
<P N="1">1. To nouri&s;h. 2. To nurture their Children.</P>
<P>Under <HI>Nouri&s;hment,</HI> are comprized Food, Apparel, Recreation, Means for Recovery of Health when they are &s;ick: In which, if Parents provide not for their Children, <HI>they are wor&s;e than Infidels.</HI> And under <HI>Nur|ture,</HI> are comprized, good Manners, a good Calling, frequent Admonition, Reprehen&s;ion, Correction, the la&s;t Remedy, which may do good when nothing el&s;e can. <HI>Prov.</HI> 19.18. &mdash; 23.13, 14.&mdash;29.17.</P>
<P N="3">3. The la&s;t Time to which Parents provident Care extendeth it &s;elf, is the Time of their Departure out of the World; and then they are to &s;et their Hou&s;e in Order, and to leave their E&s;tates to their Children.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="11" REF="009051_0010_10306F7D63188AF8">2. The <HI>Duty</HI> of Parents to the <HI>Souls</HI> of their Chil|dren extends it &s;elf al&s;o to all Times: As</P>
<P N="1">1. To their Infancy. 2. To their Youth. 3. To the Time of Parents Departure out of this World.</P>
<P N="1">1. The fir&s;t Age of a Child, is his Infancy; and the fir&s;t Part of it's Infancy, is while it remaineth in the Mother's Womb. Now the Duty of Parents at that Time are the&s;e: 1. That they pray for their Children: Thus did <HI>Rebeckah,</HI> while the Children were quick in her Womb. Tho&s;e Parents that neg|lect this <HI>Duty</HI> to their Children, con&s;ider not rightly that they are conceived in Sin: 2. That they make &s;ure (&s;o much as in them lies) that their Children be born under the Promi&s;e, or under the Covenant, in re&s;pect of the &s;piritual Part of it: How? <HI>by making &s;ure that they be under the Promi&s;e or Covenant them&s;elves:</HI> If God in Chri&s;t be their God, they may have a com|fortable Hope, that God will be the God of their Seed, according to the Promi&s;e, <HI>I will be thy God, and the God of thy Seed,</HI> Gen. 17.7.</P>
<P>The next Degree of a Child's Infancy, is when it is born: and the <HI>Duty</HI> of Parents then is, to give up their Children unto God, ca&s;ting them into the Hands of his Providence, into the Arms of his Mercy, beg|ging for them a gracious Acceptation with God; and to tender them to the Ordinance, <HI>The Sacrament of Bapti&s;m,</HI> to get the Seal of the Covenant &s;et upon them, to get them mark'd out for Salvation.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;econd Age of a Child, is it's Youth: Now the <HI>Duty</HI> of Parents to their Children at this Time, is to train them up in true Piety: <HI>To bring them up in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord.</HI> To this end,</P>
<P N="1">1. When Children begin to read, let them <HI>read the holy Scriptures:</HI> &s;o was <HI>Timothy trained up from a Child;</HI> and thus will Children &s;uck in Religion with learning.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let Children be Catechized con&s;tantly from Day to Day; only with this Caveat, that Parents deal with
<PB N="12" REF="009051_0011_10306F7F21EB5D68">
their Children, as &s;kilful Nur&s;es and Mothers do in feeding their Children, not to give them too much at once: over much dulls a Child's Under&s;tanding, and breeds Weari&s;omene&s;s to it; it is mo&s;t &s;uitable to give them <HI>Precept upon Precept, Precept upon Precept, Line upon Line, Line upon Line, here a little, &amp; there a little,</HI> I&s;ai. 28.10. Thus &s;hall they learn with Ea&s;e &amp; Delight, and in Time a great Mea&s;ure of Knowledge will be gained thereby.</P>
<P N="3">3. Let Parents declare to their Children, the admi|rable Works that God in former Times hath done for his Church, e&s;pecially &s;uch Works as he hath done in their Time: outward &s;en&s;ible Things do be&s;t work upon Children, and therefore this Di|rection was given under the Law, <HI>Jo&s;h.</HI> 4.6.21.</P>
<P N="4">4. Let Parents be to their Children a good Pattern in Piety, leading them to Chri&s;t by their Examples: This will take Place with Children, more than all Pre|cepts or parental In&s;tructions: <HI>But as for me</HI> (&s;aid <HI>Jo&s;hua) and my Hou&s;e, we will &s;erve the Lord:</HI> Jo&s;h. 14.13. He &s;ets him&s;elf fir&s;t, as a Guide to the re&s;t.</P>
<P N="5">5. Let Parents reprove and correct their Children for Sin; and that the Lord may &s;anctify this <HI>Correction</HI> unto them; <HI>Con&s;ider this, O ye Parents,</HI> Do you ob|&s;erve &s;uch and &s;uch Sins in your Children? Enter in|to your own Hearts, examine your &s;elves, whether they come not from you: Con&s;ider, how ju&s;tly the Hand of God may be upon you: and when you are angry with your Children, have an holy Anger with your &s;elves, and u&s;e this or the like Meditation with your own Souls, <HI>Lord, &s;hall I thus puni&s;h my own Sin in mine own Child? Shall I thus per&s;ecute the Corruptions of mine own Ance&s;tors? How then may&s;t thou be di&s;plea&s;ed with me for the too carnal Conception of my own Child: It may be, I then lay in &s;ome Sin, or I a&s;ked it not of thee by Prayer: Be merciful to me, O Lord; and in thy good Time, &s;hew thou pity on me and my Child!</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION V.</HI> Of the Duties of the Hu&s;band and Wife.</HEAD>
<P>THE Duties which the chief Governour and his Helper owe to one another, are either</P>
<P>Common and mutual; or proper and peculiar to each &s;everally:</P>
<P N="1">1. The common mutual <HI>Duties</HI> betwixt Man and Wife, are either</P>
<P>Of Nece&s;&s;ity to the being of Marriage; as <HI>Matri|monial Unity;</HI> or <HI>Matrimonial Cha&s;tity:</HI></P>
<P>Of Hone&s;ty to the well-being of Marriage; as a loving Affection of one another; Provident Care for one another. <HI>Mat.</HI> 19.6. <HI>Tit.</HI> 2.5. <HI>Mal.</HI> 2.15.</P>
<P>The former Duties pre&s;uppo&s;ed: there ought to be&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. A &s;weet, loving, and tender-hearted pouring out of their Hearts, with much affectionate Dearne&s;s into one another's Bo&s;oms. This mutual-melting-heart|edne&s;s, being pre&s;erved fre&s;h and fruitful, will infinite|ly &s;weeten and beautify the Marriage State. Now for the Pre&s;ervation of this Love, let them con&s;ider</P>
<P N="1">1. The compa&s;&s;ionate and melting Compellations which Chri&s;t and his Spou&s;e exchange in the <HI>Canticles, My fair one, my Love, my Dove, my undefiled, my well-beloved, the chief of ten Thou&s;and:</HI> Such a fervent and cha&s;te Love as this, all married Couples &s;hould re&s;em|ble and imitate.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Command of God to this Purpo&s;e, <HI>Hu&s;bands love your Wives,</HI> Eph. 5.25. and <HI>Wives</HI> (or young Wo|men) <HI>love your Hu&s;bands,</HI> Tit. 2.4. Methinks this Charge often remembred, &s;hould ever beat back all Heart-ri&s;ing and Bitterne&s;s, all wicked Wi&s;hes, that they had never met together, that they had never &s;een one another's Faces. When the Knot is tied, every Man &s;hould think his Wife the fitte&s;t for him, and every Wife &s;hould think her Hu&s;band the fitte&s;t for her of any other in the World.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="16" REF="009051_0015_10306F8B513935D0">2. A provident Care of one for another; which extends to the Body: <HI>No Man hateth his own Fle&s;h, but nouri&s;heth and cheri&s;heth it:</HI> and to the good Name: <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> was <HI>not willing to make</HI> Mary <HI>a publick Example:</HI> and to the Goods of this World; in which if there fall out any cro&s;s Providence, they are both to join with <HI>Job's</HI> Spirit, <HI>The Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken &amp;c.</HI> But e&s;pecially to the Soul; in praying together, for, and with one another: in taking No|tice of the Beginning and lea&s;t Mea&s;ure of Grace, and approving the &s;ame; in conferring about &s;uch Things as concern the &s;ame, mutually propounding Que&s;tions, and giving An&s;wers one to another; in maintaining holy and religious Exerci&s;es in the Family, and be|twixt their own &s;elves, in &s;tirring up one another to hear the Word, to receive the Sacraments, and con&s;ci|onably to perform all the Parts of God's publick Wor|&s;hip: In ca&s;e the one prove unconverted, let the other wait, and pray, and expect God's good Time: or in Ca&s;e the one be a Babe in Chri&s;t, or weak in Chri&s;tia|nity, let the other deal fairly, lovingly, meekly, and let our Lord Je&s;us his tender-heartedne&s;s to &s;piritual Young|lings, teach us Mercy this Way, who is &s;aid to <HI>gather the Lambs with his Arms, and to carry them in his Bo&s;om, and gently to lead tho&s;e that are with young.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The proper and peculiar Duties to each &s;everally, are&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. Of the Hu&s;band, who&s;e <HI>Duty</HI> it is, 1. That he dearly love his Wife. 2. That he wi&s;ely maintain and manage his Authority over her.</P>
<P>For the former, 1. <HI>The Matter of it</HI> is a dear Love, a &s;pecial Love, and a more &s;pecial then that common mutual Love to one another: No que&s;tion the Wife is to love her Hu&s;band, and a Brother to love his Bro|ther, and a Friend to love his Friend; but more e&s;pe|cially, or with a more <HI>&s;pecial Love,</HI> is the Hu&s;band to love his Wife. To this Purpo&s;e &s;he is called, <HI>The
<PB N="17" REF="009051_0016_10306F8E0FB6ACB0">
Wife of his Bo&s;om;</HI> to &s;hew, that &s;he ought to be as his <HI>Heart</HI> in his Bo&s;om. He mu&s;t love her at all Times, he mu&s;t love her in all Things: Love mu&s;t &s;ea&s;on and &s;weeten his Speech, Carriage, and Actions to|wards her: Love mu&s;t &s;hew it &s;elf in his Commands, Reproofs, Admonitions, In&s;tructions, Authority, Fa|miliarity with her, the Ri&s;e of which Love mu&s;t not be from her Beauty, Nobility, or becau&s;e &s;he contents and plea&s;eth her Hu&s;band; but e&s;pecially becau&s;e &s;he is his Si&s;ter in the Profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tian Religion, and an Inheritor with him of the Kingdom of Heaven: becau&s;e of her Graces, and Vertues, as Mode&s;ty, Cha&s;ti|ty, Diligence, Patience, Temperance, Faithfulne&s;s, Secrecy, Obedience, &amp;c. becau&s;e &s;he bears and brings him forth Children, the Heirs of his Name and Sub|&s;tance, and the Upholder of his Family; and becau&s;e of the Union and Conjunction of Marriage. Love growing on Beauty, Riches, Lu&s;t, or any other &s;light Grounds, is but a Blaze, and &s;oon vani&s;heth, but if grounded on the&s;e Con&s;iderations, and e&s;pecially on this Union of Marriage, it is la&s;ting and true: The want hereof is the Fountain of Strife, Quarelling, De|bate; which converts the Paradi&s;e of Marriage, into an Hell.</P>
<P N="2">2. For the <HI>manner of this Love;</HI> the Apo&s;tle gives it thus, <HI>Hu&s;bands love your own Wives even as Chri&s;t al&s;o loved the Church.</HI> Now the Love of Chri&s;t to his Church, is commended to us in the&s;e Particulars: &mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. In <HI>the Ca&s;e of his Love,</HI> which is his <HI>Love: He &s;et his Love on you, becau&s;e he loved you:</HI> his Love aro&s;e wholly and &s;olely from him&s;elf, and was every Way free: &s;o &s;hould Hu&s;bands love their Wives, tho' there be nothing in Wives to move them, but meerly be|cau&s;e they are Wives.</P>
<P N="2">2. In <HI>the Order of his Love:</HI> Chri&s;t began it to the Church, before the Church could love him: And as a Wall is fir&s;t &s;mitten on by the Sun-beams, before it
<PB N="18" REF="009051_0017_10306F9359388330">
give a Reflection of her Heat back again: &s;o the Church is fir&s;t heated and warmed at Heart by the Sen&s;e of Chri&s;t's Love, before &s;he love him again: <HI>We love him, becau&s;e he loved us fir&s;t: &mdash; Becau&s;e of the Savour of thy Ointments, therefore do the Virgins love thee:</HI> So &s;hould Hu&s;bands begin to love their own Wives. I know &s;ome Wives prevent their Hu&s;bands herein, and there may be Rea&s;on for it; but the greater is their Glory. This Pattern of Chri&s;t &s;hould rather &s;tir up the Hu&s;bands to go before them.</P>
<P N="3">3. In <HI>the Truth of Chri&s;t's Love:</HI> This was mani|fe&s;ted by the Fruits thereof to his Church: <HI>He gave him&s;elf for it, that he might &s;anctify it. &amp; clean&s;e it, &amp; pre&s;ent it to him&s;elf a glorious Church, not having &s;pot or wrinkle:</HI> So mu&s;t Hu&s;bands <HI>love</HI> their Wives in Truth and indeed, by guiding them in the Way of Life, and Path that is <HI>holy;</HI> for this is the true&s;t Character of a &s;incere Love.</P>
<P N="4">4. In <HI>the Quality of his Love:</HI> Chri&s;t's <HI>Love</HI> is an holy, pure, and cha&s;te <HI>Love;</HI> as he him&s;elf is, &s;o is his <HI>Love;</HI> &s;uch mu&s;t be the <HI>love</HI> of Hu&s;bands, an holy, pure, and cha&s;te <HI>Love.</HI> Away with all intemperate, exce&s;&s;ive, or any Ways exorbitant Pollutions of the Marriage-Bed! from which, if the fear of God, imitation of Chri&s;t, love of Purity, awfulne&s;s of God's all-&s;eeing Eye cannot draw, yet that flavi&s;h Horror, le&s;t God &s;hould puni&s;h &s;uch a Couple with no Children, or with mi&s;hapen Children, or with Idiots, or with pro|digious wicked Children, or with &s;ome other heavy Cro&s;s; one would think &s;hould be able to affright them.</P>
<P N="5">5. In <HI>the Continuance of Chri&s;t's Love? Having loved his own, he loved them to the End.</HI> His <HI>Love</HI> is a con&s;tant <HI>Love,</HI> an everla&s;ting <HI>Love.</HI> No Provocation or Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions could ever make him forget his <HI>Love. Thou ha&s;t played the Harlot with many Lovers, yet return unto me.</HI> Jer. 3.1. Such mu&s;t be the Love of Hu&s;bands, af|firm
<PB N="19" REF="009051_0018_10306F95217C9DD8">
<HI>Love,</HI> an inviolable <HI>Love:</HI> The Ground of it mu&s;t be God's Ordinance, and the Support of it mu&s;t be an inviolable Re&s;olution, that no Provocation &s;hall ever change or alter it. Hu&s;bands mu&s;t pa&s;s by all Infir|mities, endeavouring in Love to redre&s;s them, if po&s;&s;i|bly they can; or if not, to bear with them.</P>
<P N="2">2. Duty of an Hu&s;band, is, <HI>wi&s;ely to maintain and manage his Authority.</HI> Now the managing of it con|&s;i&s;ts in two Things:</P>
<P N="1">1. That he tenderly re&s;pect her.</P>
<P N="2">2. That he carefully provide for her.</P>
<P N="1">1. He mu&s;t <HI>tenderly re&s;pect her,</HI> as his Wife, Compa|nion, Yoke-fellow, as his very Delight; and the <HI>De&s;ire of his Eyes,</HI> and <HI>never be bitter again&s;t her.</HI> This Bit|terne&s;s ordinarily turneth the Edge of his Authority. If therefore any Matter of Unkindne&s;s ari&s;e (as &s;ome|times certainly will) then mu&s;t he carefully with all Lenity, Gentlene&s;s and Patience quiet all, and never &s;uffer him&s;elf nor his Wife to &s;leep in Di&s;plea&s;ure: <HI>Let not the Sun go down upon your Wrath;</HI> or if he &s;hall have Occa&s;ion to reprove her, he mu&s;t keep his Words until a convenient time, and not do it in Pre&s;ence of others; and then utter them in the Spirit of Meekne&s;s and Love. Surely if &s;he be not corrected by a Word of Wi&s;dom and Di&s;cretion, &s;he will never amend by Threats, or any ha&s;ty, rigorous Carriage: and if &s;he once begin to lo&s;e her Shamefac'dne&s;s in the Pre&s;ence of her Hu&s;band, it is likely there will be often Braw|lings and Quarellings betwixt them, and the Hou&s;e will be full of Di&s;quietne&s;s: It is be&s;t therefore to deal wi&s;ely with her, to admoni&s;h her often, to repre|hend her &s;eldom, never to lay violent Hands on her; and if &s;he be dutiful, to cheri&s;h her, that &s;he may &s;o continue; if wayward, mildly to &s;uffer her, that &s;he wax not wor&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. He mu&s;t <HI>carefully provide for her:</HI> To this pur|po&s;e he is called her Head, and Saviour, as <HI>Chri&s;t is
<PB N="20" REF="009051_0019_10306F96E15518A8">
the Head of his Church,</HI> and the Saviour of the Body: The <HI>Head</HI> (you know) is the Fountain of Motion, Quick'ning, Life, Sen&s;e, and Light&s;omene&s;s to the body; &s;o &s;hould the Hu&s;band be as the Well-&s;pring of Liveline&s;s, Light&s;omene&s;s, Light heartedne&s;s to his Wife; &s;he hath for&s;ook all for him, and therefore &s;he &s;hould receive from him a continual Influence of chearful Walking, and comfortable enjoying of her&s;elf. And a <HI>Saviour</HI> (you know) both provides for, and pro|tects the &s;aved: Chri&s;t thus &s;aved his Church; he is every Way a &s;ufficient Saviour, <HI>able perfectly to &s;ave, even to the very uttermo&s;t;</HI> he &s;aves Soul and Body, he &s;aves from all Manner of Mi&s;ery, from the Wrath of God, the Cur&s;e of the Law, the Venom of all out|ward Cro&s;&s;es, the Tyranny of Satan, the Sting of Death, the Power of the Grave, the Torments of Hell; or, if Sin be the greate&s;t Evil, (as indeed it is) <HI>he will &s;ave his People from their Sins;</HI> Mat. 1.21. I cannot &s;ay thus of the Hu&s;band; yet an Hu&s;band carrieth a Re|&s;emblance of Chri&s;t, and is after a Manner a <HI>Saviour</HI> to his Wife, to protect her and to provide for her. <HI>David</HI> compares her to a <HI>Vine,</HI> intimating that as a <HI>Vine</HI> is underpropped and rai&s;ed by &s;ome Tree or Frame near to which it is planted; &s;o is the Wife rai&s;ed to the Height of Honour by Vertue of her Relation to her Hu&s;band; by his Wealth &s;he is enriched; by his Honour &s;he is dignified: he is under God and Chri&s;t, <HI>all in all to her.</HI> In the Family, he is a King, to govern and aid her; a Prie&s;t, to pray with her and for her; a Prophet, to teach and in&s;truct her; a <HI>Saviour</HI> to pro|vide for, and protect her to <HI>his utmo&s;t,</HI> if not to <HI>the ut|mo&s;t;</HI> which indeed is proper and peculiar to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>

<P><HI>DUties</HI> of Children to Parents, are either inward, as <HI>Love and Fear;</HI> or outward, as <HI>Reverence, Obedi|ence,</HI> and <HI>Recompence.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The inward <HI>Duties</HI> which Children owe to their Parents, are <HI>Love and Fear: Love</HI> like Sugar, &s;weetens <HI>Fear,</HI> and <HI>Fear</HI> like Salt, &s;ea&s;ons <HI>Love;</HI> there mu&s;t be a loving Fear, and a fearing Love. Hence the <HI>Fear</HI> of a Child is oppo&s;ed to the <HI>Fear</HI> of a Slave; for a Child's <HI>Fear</HI> being mixt with <HI>Love,</HI> hath re&s;pect to the Offence which a Parent may take: But a Slaves <HI>Fear,</HI> which is ordinarily mixed with Hatred, hath re&s;pect to no|thing but the Puni&s;hment which his Ma&s;ter may inflict upon him. This <HI>love-like Fear</HI> is &s;o proper to Children, as that the awful Re&s;pect which the Saints bear to God, is called <HI>a filial Fear;</HI> Children have received their Sub&s;tance, from the very Sub&s;tance of their Parents, and therefore they are to perform this <HI>Duty</HI> of <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Fear</HI> to them.</P>
<P N="2">2. The outward <HI>Duties,</HI> or the Manife&s;tation of this <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Fear</HI> in Children, appears;</P>
<P N="1">1. In their Reverence, <HI>in Speech and Carriage:</HI> They mu&s;t give to their Parents reverent and honourable Titles, meek and humble Speeches, Obedience, as becomes their Age and Sex: Thus <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> and <HI>Solomon</HI> bowed, the one to his Father, the other to his Mother, <HI>Gen.</HI> 48.12. 1 <HI>Kin.</HI> 2.19. Contrary hereto is mocking and de&s;pi&s;ing Father and Mother: of which, &s;aid <HI>Solo|mon, The Eye that mocketh at his Father, and de&s;pi&s;eth to obey his Mother, the Ravens of the Valley &s;hall pick it out;</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="009051_0023_10306FA295099AD8">
Prov. 13.17. A Phra&s;e that &s;ets forth the End of a notorious Malefactor, that is hang'd in the Air till the Ravens pick out his Eyes.</P>
<P N="2">2. In their Obedience to their Commands, In|&s;tructions, Reproofs and Corections of their Parents, <HI>Eph.</HI> 6.1. <HI>Prov.</HI> 1.8, 9. The Rea&s;on is, becau&s;e of God, whom the Father repre&s;ents: Children mu&s;t remember, that whatever they do to their Parents, they do it to God; when they plea&s;e them, they plea&s;e God; when their Parents are ju&s;tly angry with them, God is angry with them: nor can they recover God's Favour (tho' all the Saints of Heaven &s;hould intreat for them) till they have &s;ubmitted them&s;elves to their own Parents; only with this Limitation, that they &s;ubmit or obey them <HI>in the Lord,</HI> Eph. 6.1.</P>
<P N="3">3. In their Recompence: This is a <HI>Duty</HI> whereby Children endeavour (as much as in them lies) to repay what they can for the Parents Kindne&s;s, Care and Co&s;t towards them, in way of Thankfulne&s;s: <HI>If any Widow have Children, or Nephews, let them fir&s;t learn to &s;hew Kind|ne&s;s at Home, and to requite their Parents,</HI> 1 Tim. 5.4. In Sickne&s;s, they mu&s;t vi&s;it them, in the time of Mourn|ing, they mu&s;t comfort them; in Want, they mu&s;t provide for them: As the Children of <HI>Jacob,</HI> who vi&s;ited, comforted, and went to buy Food for their Father, <HI>Gen.</HI> 48.1. &amp; 37.35. &amp; 42.3. In time of Dan|ger, they mu&s;t endeavour their Protection; as <HI>David</HI> did, 1 Sam. 22.3, 4. <HI>Let my Father and Mother</HI> (&s;aid he to the King of <HI>Moab) I pray thee, come forth and be with you, till I know what God will do for me: And he brought them before the King of Moab, and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the hold.</HI></P>
<P>If God plea&s;e to take Children out of this World before their Parents, and their Parents be &s;uccourle&s;s, they mu&s;t (as they can) provide for their well-being after their Deaths: Thus Chri&s;t commended his Mo|ther to his Di&s;ciple <HI>John,</HI> a little before he gave up the
<PB N="25" REF="009051_0024_10306FA4634E6808">
Gho&s;t. It is recorded of the Stork, that when the Dams are old, the young Ones feed them; and when thro' Age they are ready to faint in their flying, the young Ones help them; and when they are pa&s;t fly|ing, the young Ones carry them on their weak Backs. Thus Nature teaches Children their Duty, how much more &s;hould Grace.?</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION VII.</HI> Of the Duties of Servants to their Ma&s;ters.</HEAD>
<P>DUties of Servants to their Ma&s;ters, are either in|ward, as <HI>Fear,</HI> outward, as <HI>Reverence, Obedience.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The inward <HI>Duty</HI> is <HI>Fear: Servants be &s;ubject to your Ma&s;ters with all Fear, and account them worthy of all Honour:</HI> So proper is this Fear to a Servant, as where it is wanting, there is a plain denial of his Ma&s;ter's Place and Power: <HI>If I be a Ma&s;ter, where is my Fear?</HI> &s;aid God. Ob&s;erve, I mean not an exce&s;&s;ive &s;lavi&s;h Fear; as when a Servant fears nothing but the revenging Power of his Ma&s;ter (&s;uch was the Fear of that unprofitable Servant, who could &s;ay to his Ma&s;ter, <HI>I knew that thou wert an hard Man, and I was afraid</HI>) but I mean an awful Fear of Provoking his Ma&s;ter's Wrath, &s;o as it makes him ca&s;t every Way, how he may plea&s;e his Ma&s;ter, and &s;uch a Fear draws him on chearfully to perform his <HI>Duty.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Outward Duties which i&s;&s;ue from this Fear, are <HI>Reverence, Obedience.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Reverence,</HI> which is manife&s;ted in Speech &amp; Carriage. Thus Servants mu&s;t give reverend Titles to their Ma&s;ters, as <HI>Father, Lord,</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;ter, &amp;c.</HI> They mu&s;t yield O|bei&s;ance to them; as <HI>The Children of the Prophets, when they &s;aw that the Spirit of</HI> Elijah <HI>re&s;ted on</HI> Eli&s;ha, <HI>they came to meet him, and bowed them&s;elves to the Ground before him.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Obedience;</HI> which hath Re&s;pect to the Commands, In&s;tructions, Reproofs &amp; Corrections of their Ma&s;ters, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.18, 19, 20. But here's a Ca&s;e or two of Con&s;|cience:</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="26" REF="009051_0025_10306FA616A21910">1. How far they mu&s;t obey; or what is the extent of Servants Obedience to Ma&s;ters? &mdash; The Apo&s;tle an&s;wers, <HI>Servants obey in all Things your Ma&s;ters according to the Fle&s;h,</HI> Col. 3.22. It is not &s;ufficient that Ser|vants perform well their <HI>Duties</HI> in &s;ome Things; they mu&s;t do it in <HI>all Things;</HI> yea in Things that may be again&s;t their own Mind and Liking, if their Ma&s;ters will have it &s;o: This is clear in the Example of <HI>Joab, the King commands him to number the People: Joab</HI> de|clares him&s;elf, that he thinks it a very unmeet Thing. <HI>Why doth my Lord the King delight</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>in this Thing?</HI> 2 Sam. 24.2, &amp;c. Yet again&s;t his Judgment he yields unto the King's peremptory Command, <HI>The King's Word prevailed again&s;t Joab.</HI> Look as <HI>Peter,</HI> when Chri&s;t bid him launch out into the Deep, and let down his Net for a Draught, <HI>He an&s;wered and &s;aid, Ma&s;ter, We have toiled all the Night, and have taken nothing: neverthe|le&s;s at thy Word, I will let down the Net.</HI> So mu&s;t Ser|vants &s;ay, when they have a peremptory Command, tho' contrary to their own Judgments, this or that in all Humility, I &s;uppo&s;e, or I propound to you; <HI>Never|thele&s;s, at your Word I will let down the Net;</HI> I will do as you plea&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. But what if God and Ma&s;ter &s;hould command contrary Things? In &s;uch a Ca&s;e the Apo&s;tle &s;ets down an excellent Limitation in the&s;e four Phra&s;es, [1. <HI>As unto Chri&s;t.</HI> 2. <HI>As the Servants of Chri&s;t.</HI> 3. <HI>Doing the Will of God.</HI> 4. <HI>As to the Lord.</HI>] All the&s;e imply, That if Ma&s;ters command their Servants any Thing contrary to Chri&s;t, they may not yield to it: Upon this Ground the Midwives of the Hebrew Women, would not kill the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Children, <HI>They feared God</HI> (&s;aith the Text) <HI>and did not as the King commanded them,</HI> Exod. 1.17. In this Ca&s;e, <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> is commended, in not hearkening to his Mi&s;tre&s;s; and the Servants of <HI>Saul</HI> are commended, for refu&s;ing to &s;lay the Lord's Prie&s;ts, at their Ma&s;ters Command. When Ma&s;ters Command or
<PB N="27" REF="009051_0026_10307528FA278708">
forbid any Thing again&s;t God &amp; Chri&s;t, they go therein beyond their Commi&s;&s;ion, and their Authority cea&s;eth; &s;o that Servants may &s;ay, <HI>We ought to obey God rather than Men,</HI> Act. 5.29.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Objct.</HI> But &s;ome may object, <HI>That all Men are alike, and that there is no Difference as betwixt Ma&s;ters and Servants; nay, it is expre&s;ly forbidden to be Servants of Men.</HI> 1 Cor. 7.23.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, To <HI>be a Servant,</HI> in that Place, is not &s;im|ply to be in Subjection under another, but to be &s;o ob&s;equious to Man, as to prefer him before <HI>God:</HI> Hence the Apo&s;tle el&s;ewhere in the <HI>Duties</HI> of Servants, lays down this Antithe&s;is, <HI>Not as Men-plea&s;ers, but as the Servants of Chri&s;t;</HI> again, <HI>doing Service as to the Lord, and not to Men:</HI> The meaning is, That we mu&s;t do <HI>Duty</HI> to a <HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> not as meerly to a <HI>Man,</HI> but as to one <HI>in Chri&s;t's Stead.</HI> Ma&s;ters, by vertue of their Office and Place, bear the Image of Chri&s;t; Chri&s;t communicates his Authority unto them, and &s;o in performing <HI>Duty</HI> to Ma&s;ters, we perform <HI>Duty</HI> to Chri&s;t, and in denying <HI>Duty</HI> to Ma&s;ters, we deny <HI>Duty</HI> to Chri&s;t: Thus the Lord &s;aid to <HI>Samuel,</HI> when the Peo|ple rejected his Government, <HI>They have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I &s;hould not reign over them.</HI> Con&s;ider this, all ye that are <HI>Servants,</HI> though <HI>Ma&s;ters</HI> &s;hould neither reward your good Service, nor revenge your ill Service, yet Chri&s;t will do both: This is your Prerogative that fear God, above all other Servants; others may &s;erve their Ma&s;ters with <HI>Fear and Trem|bling,</HI> in Singlene&s;s of Heart, and with good Will, but only Chri&s;tians and Saints do <HI>Service as to Chri&s;t;</HI> and this makes them not content them&s;elves with doing the Thing, but to endeavour to do it after the be&s;t Manner they can, &s;o as God and Chri&s;t may accept of it.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="009051_0027_10302DDD4D46C208" MS="y">I have now run thro' the Family, and informed you of the <HI>Duties</HI> both of <HI>Governours</HI> and <HI>Governed.</HI> Chri&s;tians, look within you, look about you: <HI>That Man is not a good Man, that is not good in all his Relations.</HI> The &s;ame God that requires us to &s;erve him as pri|vate Per&s;ons, requires us to &s;erve him in our Relations: And therefore, though you be never &s;o careful of your <HI>Duty</HI> in the former Re&s;pect, yet you may go to Hell for neglecting your <HI>Duties,</HI> as <HI>Ma&s;ters, Servants, Hu&s;|bands, Wives, Parents,</HI> or <HI>Children:</HI> Nay, I'le &s;ay a lit|tle more, that though you &s;hould be good in one Relation, yet if you endeavour not to be good in every Relation, you &s;hall never go to Heaven: for the &s;ame God that commands you to &s;erve him as a Ma&s;ter, commands you to &s;erve him as a Father, as an Hu&s;band, &amp;c. <HI>And he that keeps the whole Law, and offends in one Point, is guilty of all,</HI> Jam. 2.10.</P>
