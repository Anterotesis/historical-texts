<HI>Man</HI> in his fir&s;t E&s;tate, and &s;o <HI>Angels</HI> in theirs, were very much made for <HI>Contemplation</HI> and <HI>Admi|ration.</HI> And <HI>the&s;e</HI> are very much the Exerci&s;e, Plea&s;ure and Improvement of <HI>renewed</HI> and enlight|ned Minds under the <HI>Go&s;pel.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Admiration</HI> &s;eems the fir&s;t Affection of an <HI>Intelli|gent Creature,</HI> both in the Order of Nature and of Time; and of &s;pecial U&s;e and Influence in the ra|tional, moral and <HI>Divine Life.</HI> We may &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Adam</HI> was &s;truck with va&s;t and a mo&s;t plea&s;ing <HI>Ad|miration</HI> upon his fir&s;t coming into Being.

<P>Such we may &s;uppo&s;e were the Emotions of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Mind, upon his fir&s;t View of his <HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> the living <HI>Creatures</HI> about him, and of the <HI>Heavens</HI> over him.

It was <HI>Eve,</HI> form'd in the &s;ame <HI>Image and Likene&s;s of God</HI> that he &s;aw and felt within him&s;elf.

Thus his <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Act of De|votion to his <HI>Maker</HI> was Admiration, which ju&s;tifies the Wi&s;dom of the <HI>Schools,</HI> who have made it the fir&s;t of the <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions.</HI> It certainly is &s;o, and <HI>ever</HI> was.

<P><HI>God</HI> has made all his wonderful Works to be ad|mired; to <HI>be &s;ought out with Plea&s;ure</HI> by all rational Beings.

This is their <HI>Wor&s;hip</HI> and Prai&s;e to God, and their own <HI>Improvement</HI> in Knowledge and Goodne&s;s&mdash;It had been the im|mediate <HI>Sin and Fall</HI> of our fir&s;t Parents, without their eating of the <HI>forbidden Fruit,</HI> yea before <HI>that</HI> was forbidden to them, if the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Affection and Exerci&s;e of their Mind had not been a religious re|verend <HI>Admiration</HI> of God, in Them&s;elves, the Heavens and Earth, and in all the living Creatures about them.

<P><HI>There</HI> are the <HI>Objects</HI> of Admiration which <HI>Eye hath not &s;een, nor Ear heard,</HI> neither can they <HI>enter into the Heart of Man to conceive of;</HI> And the <HI>An|gels of Heaven</HI> have greater Capacities and Powers to <HI>look into</HI> the Wi&s;dom Power and Goodne&s;s of God in all his Works: How then do we think that

I no more doubt, my <HI>Readers,</HI> of the Truth of &s;omething <HI>like</HI> the&s;e things that I here write, than I do of almo&s;t any thing <HI>not &s;een</HI> and not revealed to me in the Word of God.

<P>Only let us never think that the <HI>Admiration of perfected Spirits</HI> ever grows into any <HI>like Surpri&s;es and Amazements,</HI> as are &s;ometimes felt by us. The Light which &s;hines in and on them in &s;o pure clear and di&s;tinct, the Manner wherein they think and perceive is &s;o perfect, the Government of their Tho't &amp; Affection is &s;o true and exact, that it for|bids us to imagine any &s;uch Weakne&s;s and Infirmity in their Admiration, as we find in our own. Inno|cent &amp; holy Minds have a Strength, Steddine&s;s and Fortitude of Tho't, which we have lo&s;t by our Fall. God of his Fulne&s;s communicates &s;o to them, as is ever filling, refre&s;hing and &s;atisfying 'em. <HI>In his Light they &s;ee Light.</HI> The Glory of <HI>his Face</HI> is ever &s;hining on them in all that they behold.

They live in the World of Wonders, and &s;ee into the Wonders of all Worlds, &s;ee nothing little or common in any of them. All is great and good in their Eyes that God has done.

<P><Q>The great End and De&s;ign of this Affection of <HI>Admiration</HI> (&s;ays our admirable Dr. <HI>Watts</HI>) is to fix our <HI>Attention</HI> on the admired Object, to impre&s;s it more effectually on our <HI>Memory,</HI> and to give a &s;en&s;ible <HI>Delight</HI> to our Mind.</Q> How good, how plea&s;ant and nece&s;&s;ary then is it, to u&s;e this <HI>Means</HI> of fixing our Hearts on <HI>God</HI> by his Works, which day and night declare his <HI>Glory,</HI> and &s;peak to us of his Eternal Power and <HI>Godhead.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;hort, Without the <HI>Admiration</HI> of God in his Works of Nature, Providence and Grace, there neither is nor can be any thing of <HI>Religion,</HI> either among Angels or Men. And there is &s;o little Re|ligion among Men on Earth, becau&s;e there is no more Admiration of the ble&s;&s;ed God in the Things that are &s;een, or that are revealed to us by him. The more God is admired by us the better He will be wor&s;hiped and &s;erved by us. It is becau&s;e He is &s;o perfectly admir'd by the Spirits in Glory, that he is &s;o perfectly &s;erv'd and obey'd by them. The Admiration of God works by Love to Him, Delight in him, De&s;ire to plea&s;e and glorify him, Fear and Reverence of his excellent Maje&s;ty, and the Hope of &s;eeing and &s;erving him for ever. It draws all the Affections of the Soul after it, carries them along with it, and is the Spring and Life of all Devotion. It enlarges the Mind and dilates the Heart, and leads it away a willing Captive. It opens the Lips to &s;hew forth God's Prai&s;e, it li&s;ts up the Eyes and Hands to him, with Tran&s;ports
<PB N="ix" REF="004001_0012_100373DC9749CAC0">of Joy: And at times too it &s;tops the Voice, and <Q>&s;trikes us mute, and Prai&s;e &s;its &s;ilent on the Tongue.</Q> &mdash; Such an In&s;trument of Devotion, and Handmaid to it, is true Admiration. It is &s;acred and devoted to God, and Man in his Inno|cence kept it &s;o. It is not only con&s;i&s;tent with perfect Tranquility and Happine&s;s, but indeed pro|motes and advances it. There can be no true State or Reli&s;h of real Happine&s;s in created Spi|rits, without the free and full Exerci&s;e of this Affection. If there were nothing to be admir'd in <HI>God and Chri&s;t,</HI> in Heaven and Glory, how &s;hould they be the <HI>Beatific Objects</HI> to us?</P>
<P>I &s;hall add but <HI>two</HI> Words more.

Our <HI>Surpri&s;es</HI> at things new and rare and unexpected is from the Weakne&s;s of Fle&s;h and Blood, and from the Darkne&s;s of our Minds. The more feeble the more Surprize, but the &s;tronger the Intellect is the more &s;erene and placid, even and fix'd is the Admiration. &mdash; I know not which was <HI>Eve</HI>'s Fault and the Beginning of her Sin, whether too <HI>much</HI> Surpri&s;e at the <HI>Serpent</HI>'s &s;peak|ing to her, or too <HI>little</HI> Emotion at it. One or other might be the Beginning of her Fall. It was a wonderful Thing that a Snake or Worm &s;hould find a Tongue and Voice to &s;peak to her. His cur&s;ed Motion to her, to eat of the forbidden Fruit, &s;hould have rais'd in her a holy <HI>Indig|nation.</HI> Her Innocence and Holine&s;s &s;hould have &s;o expre&s;s'd it &s;elf, when &s;he heard God contra|dicted, and mean and ill Things &s;ugge&s;ted of Him.

<P>And yet the <HI>&s;piritual Nature</HI> of Angels and Men is not to be compared with the Spirituality of God, or the <HI>Simplicity</HI> of his E&s;&s;ence.

<P>It is a mo&s;t ju&s;t and glorious Account that God gave of Him&s;elf to <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> I AM THAT I AM.

He is the One Law|giver and Judge, the <HI>Lord of Ho&s;ts and King of Glory.</HI> Wi&s;dom and Might are His: his Dominion is an Everla&s;ting Dominion, and his Kingdom from Gene|ration to Generation.</P>
<P>Intellectual and moral Creatures carry an Image of God's <HI>Dominion</HI> in their Nature. They are made for Rule and Government in their Places. <HI>Angels</HI> are therefore called <HI>Dominions</HI> and <HI>Thrones, Princi|palities</HI> and <HI>Powers.</HI> And <HI>Man</HI> was in like manner made for <HI>Government</HI> here on Earth. The <HI>Fear</HI> of him was put upon the Creatures, and they herein are put <HI>under his Feet.</HI> God fir&s;t &s;aid to him, <HI>Have thou Dominion,</HI> and then bro't them to <HI>Adam</HI> to give them <HI>Names.</HI> So he gave him Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them all. This is celebrated in the <HI>Eighth P&s;alm;</HI> the Glory is given to God and all Pride is hidden from Man: "<HI>What is Man that Thou art mindful of him! Thou ha&s;t made him a little lower than the Angeis, and ha&s;t crowned him with Glory and Honour.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Man</HI> is made for <HI>Dominion</HI> in his Place as <HI>Angels</HI> are in their. Rational and moral <HI>Powers</HI> are given to be &s;ure to be u&s;ed and <HI>applied,</HI> to great and good <HI>Ends</HI> and Purpo&s;es, re&s;pecting <HI>God, Self,</HI> and <HI>Fel|low Creatures,</HI> in one World or other. The Appli|cation of the&s;e Powers mu&s;t be in <HI>Subjection</HI> to God, the <HI>Government</HI> of our Selves, and a righteous <HI>Con|duct</HI> toward others, below or above us, or on a Le|vel with us.</P>
<P>But principally Man's <HI>Glory</HI> is, that he is made for <HI>Self-Government,</HI> for Rule over him&s;elf, for <HI>a Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his own Soul,</HI> the Government of his own <HI>Mind</HI> and <HI>Will, De&s;ires</HI> and <HI>Appetites, Thot's, Words</HI> and <HI>Actions.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This</HI> was the Dominion he was principally de&s;ign|ed for, and inve&s;ted with. The <HI>Law</HI> of his God put <HI>within</HI> him, and given to him in <HI>Words</HI> as &s;oon
<PB N="17" REF="004001_0032_1003749473285040">as he found him&s;elf in Being, &s;ufficiently told him this. It &s;pake indeed plainly his <HI>Subjection to-God,</HI> that he was made for <HI>Obedience</HI> and a rea&s;onable Service; But it &s;pake al&s;o his <HI>Preheminence</HI> above the Creatures put under him, in a di&s;tingui&s;hing Power for the <HI>Rule</HI> of his own Actions, with Un|der&s;tanding and Choice, Liberty and Freedom, and from a Con&s;cience of right and wrong.</P>
<P>Under&s;tanding and Wi&s;dom, the Power of Tho't and Con&s;ideration was given to Man <HI>for this End. "The Lord God put the Man into the Garden to dre&s;s and keep it, and He commanded the Man, &s;aying</HI> &amp;c. Thus Man was made <HI>under the Law to God,</HI> a Law to him&s;elf, and was both able and inclined to do the Will of God, and to govern him&s;elf thereby. And this Power for <HI>Self-Government,</HI> by the Light and Law of God within him, and by the Will of God revealed to him, was the <HI>Image</HI> of his God upon him.</P>
<P>For the <HI>Divine Dominion</HI> and Government is in the Perfection of Wi&s;dom and Righteou&s;ne&s;s. <HI>The Sceptre of his Kingdom is a right Sceptre.</HI> He does according to <HI>his Will</HI> in the Armies of Heaven, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth; but his Will is <HI>perfect,</HI> his <HI>Ways are Truth and Judgment,</HI> He is <HI>holy in all his Work, ju&s;t and right is He.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore the <HI>Subjection</HI> of Man to <HI>God</HI> is his <HI>go|verning Him&s;elf,</HI> in all his Thot's Words &amp; Actions, in a wi&s;e, righteous and &s;uperiour manner; as be|comes a Creature in the <HI>Likene&s;s of God,</HI> and made for Authority and Rule on Earth.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Lord</HI> therefore tells us that he came into our World to recover Man into his Original Freedom and Liberty.

<P><HI>Man</HI> was made innocent, wi&s;e and holy, and therefore nece&s;&s;arily <HI>happy.</HI> He was made ble&s;&s;ed for ever, in ca&s;e he did not commit <HI>Sin,</HI> from which Mi&s;ery naturally flows, and with which it is nece&s;|&s;arily connected.&mdash;<HI>Man</HI> was made happy both as to Soul and Body: He wanted nothing for either. He had Wi&s;dom and Purity within, Peace &amp; Joy, Content and Plea&s;ure. Without him he had a Pa|radi&s;e, a Garden of God. Every thing grew there, plea&s;ant to the Eye, to the Smell and to the Ta&s;te. His Eye beheld a Creation of God's in Perfection. He had a charming Tongue and Voice to prai&s;e Him. The mu&s;ical <HI>Birds,</HI> happy in the <HI>Branches,</HI> &s;inging and fea&s;ting there, were but an Emblem of their Owners Liberty and Freedom to what was good and joyous.

<P>Every intellectual and moral Plea&s;ure attended Man in his Paradi&s;aic State, as well as every &s;en&s;i|tive Delight.

<P>No doubt but the Image of God was <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> upon Man in his Earthly Paradi&s;e, and <HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> to him&s;elf in his inward Frame.
