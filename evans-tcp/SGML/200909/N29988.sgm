<HEAD>A brief Account, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Occa&s;ion of this Meeting, was up|on the Reque&s;t of <HI>Mary Man</HI> of <HI>Le|banon,</HI> who &s;ent us Word that &s;he de|&s;ired to be Bapti&s;ed by our Society according to the Rule given in Scripture, by <HI>Burying in the Water;</HI> and upon our re|ceiving this Me&s;&s;age, and con&s;idering that Chri&s;t's Ordinances ought to be Publickly Ad|mini&s;tred, we drew up a Paper Signed by &s;everal of us, Signifying the time when we de&s;igned to Admini&s;ter the Ordinance; which Paper was publickly &s;et up in <HI>Lebanon,</HI> &s;ome Weeks before the time appointed; and though we ordered our Meeting there, <HI>(viz.)</HI> at <HI>Lebanon</HI> to begin on the fir&s;t day of the Week, the day which we u&s;u|ally meet on as well as the re&s;t of our Neigh|bours, yet we appointed the &s;econd day of the Week for the Admini&s;tration of the Ordinance, de&s;igning thereby to give the greater opportuni|ty to any to be pre&s;ent, that otherwi&s;e might be prevented by their own Meetings. And accor|dingly when the day came, we &s;et out from our &s;everal Habitations in order to attend our ap|pointed Meeting; and as we were pa&s;&s;ing through <HI>Norwich,</HI> we were &s;topt by the Con&s;ta|ble and a rude Company of young Men, who
<PB N="4" REF="039855_0003_101490ECBAD395E8">
offered great abu&s;e to &s;ome of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Company, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">rticularly dragging a Woman <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Company by the Arm along on the Ground, and violently twitching her over the Door-Cill and throwing her on the Floor, whereby &s;he was much hurt. The next day we were very cruelly whipt with an unmerciful In&s;trument, and then &s;ent back to <HI>New-London</HI> and committed to Pri&s;on, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In the next place I &s;hall proceed to make Re|ply to the afore&s;aid Pamphlet, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In page fir&s;t he calls the Sufferers <HI>Notorious Offenders.</HI></P>
<P>In his 2d. page he &s;ignifies, that the Offence which the&s;e Offenders gave, was with notorious aggravating Circum&s;tances. In his 3d. page he declares, that the Per&s;on here named, <HI>(viz.) An|drew Davis,</HI> was one of <HI>John Rogers</HI>'s Brethren in Iniquity and Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and that they were Travelling from <HI>New-London</HI> and <HI>Groton,</HI> with a de&s;ign for <HI>Lebanon,</HI> and all this as pernici|ou&s;ly as needle&s;sly &s;hall be made evident, <HI>(Says he.)</HI></P>
<P>In his 4th. page he &s;ignifies, that we were equally concerned in the Admini&s;tration of Bap|ti&s;m, and that we knew not who &s;hould be imme|diately call'd to do it when we came there, and that there was not any of us that pretended to be an Officer more than the re&s;t. Whereupon he argues, that we were very ignorant or unbe|lieving of that Text. <HI>Heb.</HI> 5.4. <HI>And no Man taketh the Honour unto him&s;elf, but he that is called of God, as was</HI> Aaron.</P>
<P>To which I an&s;wer, That by this Account which he here gives, it is very manife&s;t that none
<PB N="5" REF="039855_0004_101490EE4AF49C78">
of us w<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ward to take the Honour to our &s;elves, but <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">e waiting on God to know his Mind and Will in the matter, and who he would call to the Work, like as did tho&s;e Servants of the Lord that were in the Church of <HI>Antioch,</HI> Acts 13.1, 2, 3. ver&s;es; who not pre&s;uming to take the Honour to them&s;elves, were in like manner waiting for a Call from God. By which it is manife&s;t that they knew not who the Lord would Call to that Work, until he made it ma|nife&s;t to them, by commanding them to &s;eparate <HI>Barnabas</HI> and <HI>Saul,</HI> and &s;o when they were called of God as was <HI>Aaron,</HI> they immediately attended on the Work.</P>
<P>Now the fal&s;e Teachers and Hirelings which the World heaps up to them&s;elves, &s;poken of 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.3. are not Called of God as was <HI>Aa|ron,</HI> but have their Call and Authority from Men, and by human Art prepare them&s;elves for their Trade as other Crafts-Men do, and then through Covetou&s;ne&s;s with feigned or &s;tudied words, make Merchandize of the People, as it is writ|ten 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. Chap. 1, and 3. ver&s;es. Now the&s;e fal&s;e Teachers here de&s;cribed, are they who are not called of God as was <HI>Aaron,</HI> but for the lucre of great Sums of Money, pre&s;ume to take the Honour to them&s;elves of being call'd Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> By all which it is manife&s;t that he greatly wre&s;ts this Scripture through his own darkne&s;s. Now in the latter part of this 4th. page he begins to &s;et forth, what was the Notorious aggravating Circum&s;tance of the&s;e Notorious Offenders Offence. And fir&s;t he &s;eems to In&s;inuate, as if we ordere'd our coming
<PB N="6" REF="039855_0005_101490EFDAB92FC0" MS="y">
into Town on purpo&s;e to meet <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">em fir&s;t re|turning from their Meeting, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> our other Company to meet them returning from their Sacramental Solemnity. Yet in the begining of his 5th. Page he &s;eems to yield that this coming might be purely accidental, and &s;o an&s;wers him&s;elf; and &s;aves me the trouble of an&s;wering him to this matter. For mo&s;t certain our coming into Town at that time, was purely accidental as he allows, nor did we know what bu&s;ine&s;s they were upon; being only de&s;igned to pa&s;s along the Country-Road to our own Meet|ing. Now let the Reader judge, whether our pa&s;&s;ing along the Road to our own Meeting, was any more ju&s;t ground of Offence to them, than their doing the like was to us, or whether it was not &s;o far wide of the Golden Rule, to do to all Men, as ye would they &s;hould do to you; that it bears the plain Image of Per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>In the next place he adds, that we might have gone another way. To which I an&s;wer, that I never knew or under&s;tood that there was any way to <HI>Lebanon</HI> from <HI>New-London</HI> or <HI>Groton,</HI> but that Road, except we had cro&s;&s;ed a multitude of Fields and Inclo&s;ures, whereby we &s;hould have given ju&s;t grounds of Offence to our Neigh|bours, by tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing upon their Fences and Lands, and unaccountable Difficulty to our &s;elves, and might ju&s;tly have been puni&s;hed for Tre&s;pa&s;&s;ers; and it is marvellous that even <HI>Envy</HI> it &s;elf &s;hould &s;o much blind any Per&s;on, as to cau&s;e them to de&s;ire to put their Neighbours upon &s;uch an unrea&s;onable and unlawful Action.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="039855_0006_101490F357D43840" MS="y">He proceeds al&s;o to inform the Reader, that the fir&s;t Company brought a Chair with them, to aggravate the Offence.</P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> That there was a &s;mall Child's Chair brought for the Relief of a poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Child, which the Grand-father, Grand-mother and Uncle were carrying to its Mother at <HI>Lebanon,</HI> (I grant) which di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Child was attended with a &s;ore Malady, whereby the Bowels often|times fell out of the Body in great quantities, to the wonderful Angui&s;h and Di&s;tre&s;s of the Child; and there being no way to help or move the Child many times but in the Chair, &s;o that the nece&s;&s;ity of the Chair was &s;o apparant to all the Spectators, that not one of them blamed us on that account; nor did the Ju&s;tice make it any Article again&s;t us: And therefore it is very unfair for him to endeavour to deceive the World, by giving &s;o unintelligible an Account of that matter.</P>
<P>He al&s;o adds, That &s;ome of the other Com|pany called out to the People, <HI>Did ye not hear there is a &s;olemn Ordinance to be admini&s;tred to mor|row upon a Per&s;on at</HI> Lebanon, <HI>according to Chri&s;t's In&s;titution?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> This is another of the notorious ag|gravating Circum&s;tances which he charges the Sufferers to be guilty of. And indeed it is mat|ter of great Lamentation to con&s;ider, that &s;uch who call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, &s;hould &s;o long practice the Ordinances contrary to Chri&s;t's In|&s;titution: That they &s;hould be &s;o hardned there|in, as not to indure to be told that they are like to be admini&s;tred according to Chri&s;t's In&s;titu|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="039855_0007_101490F5D7A58B08">He farther adds as follows, <HI>And though it can|not be ju&s;tly thought a matter of Con&s;cience in them, to come to us in &s;uch Time and Manner, when they knew it was contrary to the Law of the Govern|ment.</HI></P>
<P>To the fir&s;t of the&s;e A&s;&s;ertions, <HI>(viz.) That we came to them,</HI> I utterly deny; for we were on|ly pa&s;&s;ing along the Country Road towards our own Meeting, and was got onward of our way beyond their Meeting Hou&s;e, I &s;uppo&s;e the be&s;t part of a Mile, where they came to us, and with Violence &s;topt us, and made Pri&s;oners of us, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by which it is manife&s;t that it was they that came to us, &amp; not we to them, as he has wrong|ly a&s;&s;erted.</P>
<P>He al&s;o a&s;&s;erts, That we knew it was contra|ry to the Law of the Government.</P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> Here I think he does the Government no Honour by informing the World, that they have made Laws to debar &s;uch as differ from them in matters of Religion, the liberty of the Kings High way to pa&s;s to their own Meetings, &s;ince our Lord the King hath granted equal Li|berty of Con&s;cience to all di&s;&s;enters to hold their Meetings, and &s;erve God according to their Con&s;ciences.</P>
<P>In his 7th. page he a&s;&s;erts, that we knew not who or whether any of us was to Bapti&s;e, or whether any Per&s;on would be Bapti&s;ed, and &s;o <HI>(&s;ays he)</HI> it proved the next time when they actu|ally went to <HI>Lebanon,</HI> under the &s;ame Pretence, Bapti&s;m was not admini&s;tred, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> Here again I mu&s;t deny his a&s;&s;ertions; for the very next time that we went up pretend|ing
<PB N="9" REF="039855_0008_101490F75A715920">
to Admini&s;ter the Ordinance, it was actually done, and another Per&s;on who was convinced by our means, <HI>(viz.) Eli&s;ha Man,</HI> was al&s;o Bap|ti&s;ed at the &s;ame time. Indeed there was before this three of us that went up to vi&s;it our Friends, and hold a Meeting among them, but with no pretence of Bapti&s;ing any Per&s;on at that time.</P>
<P>However he makes the&s;e fal&s;e a&s;&s;ertions a foundation to build &s;ome of his Mocks and Scoffs on, for he immediately adds, that our In|fallible Spirit doth &s;ometimes deceive us, as it did our great Apo&s;tle the late <HI>John Rogers,</HI> who pre|tended from the In&s;piration of it, that he was proof again&s;t all Infection of Body, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And to put the matter upon Tryal, daringly ventured in|to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> in the time of the <HI>Small Pox,</HI> but receiv|ed the Infection and dyed of it, with &s;everal of his Family taking it from him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> Here I think he plainly di&s;covers his unchri&s;tianlike and unmanly &s;pirit, by Raking a Man out of his Grave to be the Subject of his Game; and it is great Pre&s;umptuou&s;ne&s;s in him, to take upon him to judge one that is gone into the Hands of a Righteous Judge. For in the fir&s;t place he a&s;&s;erts, That our <HI>Infallible Spirit deceives us as it did</HI> John Rogers, <HI>who pretended from the In&s;piration of it, that he was proof again&s;t all Infecti|on of Body,</HI> &amp;c. Now I am fully per&s;waded that <HI>J. R.</HI> never &s;pake tho&s;e words but that <HI>J. Bac|kus</HI> is highly guilty of &s;landering him in his Grave concerning this matter. He al&s;o adds, <HI>That to put the matter upon tryal, daringly ventured into</HI> Bo&s;ton, <HI>in the time of the</HI> Small Pox, <HI>but re|ceived the Infection and ayed of it, with &s;everal of
<PB N="10" REF="039855_0009_101490FA2244FEB8">
his Family.</HI> Now how pre&s;umptuous and &s;en&s;o|rious a Judgment is it for him to a&s;&s;ert, that his going to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> was <HI>daringly to put the matter upon Tryal,</HI> when it is well known that it had been his Practice for more than forty years pa&s;t, to vi|&s;it all &s;ick Per&s;ons as often as he had opportuni|ty, and particularly tho&s;e who had the <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> when in the height of their Di&s;temper he has &s;at on their Bed-&s;ide &s;everal hours at a time, di&s;|cour&s;ing of the things of God; &s;o that his going to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> the la&s;t time, was no other than his con&s;tant Practice had been ever &s;ince he made a profe&s;&s;ion of Religion. Now it is certain that <HI>J. Rogers</HI> in his life time, and all his Society to this day, do firmly believe from the te&s;timony of the Scripture, that God's Protection is with his faithful Children through the Cour&s;e of this Life, to continue them to old Age, (notwith&s;tanding the Calamities which he &s;ends on the Earth,) except when he Calls them to lay down their Lives for his Truth by way of Martyrdom, as may be &s;een abundantly in Scripture. <HI>Job.</HI> 6.26. <HI>Thou &s;halt come to thy Grace in a full Age, like as a &s;hock of Corn cometh in in his Sea&s;on.</HI> P&s;al. 91.16. <HI>With long life will I &s;atisfy him,</HI> &amp;c. Now the Age of Man is &s;et forth in Scripture to be &s;even|ty years, as is to be &s;een <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 90.10. <HI>The days of our years are three &s;core years and ten,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now although we have the Scripture plenti|fully to confirm us in this Principle of God's pro|tecting his faithful Children to old age, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Yet we know it is <HI>appointed for all Men once to die,</HI> ac|cording to what is written <HI>Heb.</HI> 9.27. and by what manner of Death it may plea&s;e God to
<PB N="11" REF="039855_0010_101490FEA501ADB8">
take them to him&s;elf, after he hath pre&s;erved them to old age, he has not revealed to us, and therefore neither <HI>J. Rogers</HI> in his life time, nor any of his Society &s;ince his Death has underta|ken to decide the matter; judging it to be one of tho&s;e &s;ecret things which God has not reveal|ed to us, and therefore is not our Bu&s;ine&s;s to meddle with, according to what is written <HI>Deut.</HI> 29.29. <HI>The &s;ecret things belong unto the Lord our God; but tho&s;e things which are revealed belong unto us,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now let every unprejudiced Reader take no|tice how little cau&s;e <HI>J. Backus</HI> has to reflect <HI>John Rogers</HI>'s manner of Death upon him, who lived to the age of &s;eventy three years, and then died in his own Hou&s;e, and on his own Bed, having his Rea&s;on continued to the la&s;t, and manife&s;ting his Peace with God, and perfect a&s;|&s;urance of a better Life. He had al&s;o a very ea|&s;y Death, without any &s;trugling or &s;triving, as is common to many People.</P>
<P>He farther adds, <HI>That &s;everal of his Family al&s;o died, taking the di&s;temper from</HI> him. To which I an&s;wer, That this is another mi&s;take, for not one of his Family died of the <HI>Small-Pox,</HI> tho' &s;everal of my Family did.</P>
<P>He al&s;o adds, <HI>That more In&s;tances of their decepti|on might be mentioned,</HI> &amp;c. To which I an&s;wer, That hitherto he has mentioned no deception at all, and therefore very improper to &s;ay, <HI>more might be mentioned.</HI></P>
<P>In his 8th. page he &s;ays, we <HI>wilfully cho&s;e the Corporal Puni&s;hment,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="039855_0011_10149100293BCD28">And in the 9th. page he adds, That <HI>by our Re|&s;olute Choice we con&s;trained him to order this Puni&s;h|ment, or di&s;regard the Law, and that in a moral &s;en&s;e we whipt our own Backs, and may thank our &s;elves for it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> Here I cannot but take notice how ex|actly he &s;peaks the Language of the <HI>Papi&s;t</HI> a|gain&s;t the Martyrs, who always informed the World, that they cho&s;e the Flames and were guilty of their own Deaths, and were Self-mur|therers, and might e&s;cape if they would, and that the Authority were compelled to Puni&s;h them, or di&s;regard the Laws, &amp;c.</P>
<P>By which it appears, that Per&s;ecutors are not only of one &s;pirit, out naturally &s;peak one Lan|guage: And indeed I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that accor|ding to my Judgment, the <HI>Papi&s;t</HI> &s;pake as much Truth as <HI>J. Backus.</HI></P>
<P>For the Martyrs cho&s;e the <HI>Flames</HI> as much as we cho&s;e the Whip; for neither they nor we cho&s;e either the Flames or the Whip, but as we were compelled thereto by our cruel Per&s;ecu|tors.</P>
<P>In the next place he labours to hide the Cruel|ty of the Whip, he &s;ignifies that the Whip was but a &s;ingle Cord, without a knot in it.</P>
<P>All which I allow to be true, for that the Cord was &s;o large that it would not admit of a knot, but in&s;tead of a knot it was firmly whipt with a waxed thread at lea&s;t four Inches at the end, and then &s;oaked in Liquor.</P>
<P>He al&s;o adds in his 10th page, That <HI>he &s;tood by and &s;aw every &s;troke, and di&s;covered not a drop of
<PB N="13" REF="039855_0012_10149103AA6D5BD0">
Blood, &s;ave only from &s;ome &s;trokes with the end of the Whip, under the Arms of &s;ome of them,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Here I can but marvel at his Confidence in rendering the Effects of the Whip &s;o &s;mall. How|ever &s;ince he produceth no better Proof for his a&s;&s;ertion than his own bare Word, which to di&s;|prove I &s;hall Produce two &s;ufficient Te&s;timonies; the fir&s;t is the multitude of Spectators, who&s;e Eyes &s;aw the terrible Wounds which every &s;troke gave, excepting a few &s;trokes which accidental|ly took the Cloathing of one or two of the Suf|ferers.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Te&s;timony which I &s;hall produce, is the Wounds in the Bodies of every one of the Sufferers, which till the Grave &s;hall hide, will re|main as a &s;ufficient Te&s;timony to di&s;cover the deceit of his A&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame page he adds, <HI>That he &s;aw no Per|&s;on in&s;ult them or triumph in their Correction, but the whole multitude of Spectators with a becoming a&s;pect of</HI> Grief, &amp;c.</P>
<P>To which I an&s;wer, That although the whole Body of People (&s;ome few &s;ober Per&s;ons only ex|cepted) had &s;pent the greate&s;t part of the day in as great Revilings, Mocks, Scoffs, Flouts and Deri&s;ions perhaps as has been &s;een in any age of the World, by Per&s;ecutors again&s;t God's Chil|dren, which is a manife&s;t Token of the Enmity that is between the &s;eed of the Woman and the &s;eed of the Serpent, yet it was very ob&s;ervable, that in the time of the Execution of the Sen|tence, it was acted with &s;uch Barbarity, that it &s;eemed to &s;trike a d<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">mp upon the whole A&s;&s;em|bly; in &s;o much that I never heard of any Per|&s;on
<PB N="14" REF="039855_0013_101491057758C320">
triumphing in their Suffering &s;o much as <HI>J.

<P>In the &s;ame Page he &s;peaks deridingly of the Sufferers for calling upon God and Chri&s;t for A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Support in the time of their Tor|ment, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>To which I an&s;wer, That this is no new thing either for God's Children to call to their Heavenly Father for Help, when under the hands of their cruel Per&s;ecutors, or for their Per&s;ecutors to mock and deride them for it, as the Hi&s;tory of Per&s;ecutions will fully prove; as al&s;o our Narative of the Wars in <HI>New-Eng|land</HI> with the <HI>Indians</HI> informs us, that &s;ome of the fir&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Words which the Natives learned of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> was <HI>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t help me;</HI> which Words they had learned of their di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Pri|&s;oners, when under the Hands of their cruel Tormentors: Which Words tho&s;e Salvages would often repeat by way of Deri&s;ion to the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> perhaps too much in the &s;ame Spirit which <HI>J. B.</HI> here derides the&s;e Sufferers, where he calls them, <HI>Creatures in Human Shapes;</HI> and calls their Prayers <HI>wild and un&s;criptural Zeal, and clamorous Invocations of the Name of God and Chri&s;t for A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Support,</HI> &amp;c. However, that he may not remain &s;o ignorant in the Scripture a|ny longer, I de&s;ire him to read <HI>Acts</HI> 7.59, 60.

<HI>And they &s;toned Stephen, calling upon God and &s;ay|ing, Lord Je&s;us receive my Spirit: And he kneeled down and cryed with a loud voice,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>In his 13th Page he gives a Record (of his own making) relating to <HI>John Bolles,</HI> which Re|cord declares that <HI>J. Bolles</HI> acknowledged that he came from <HI>New-London,</HI> and was going to <HI>Lebanon,</HI> and that he knew it was contrary to our Law, and that they did it in defiance to the Law.</P>
<P>To which I an&s;wer, That God's three Chil|dren were ca&s;t into the fiery Furnace for de|claring their defiance to the King's Law, which was made to force Men's Con&s;ciences in mat|ters of Religion; and all the Prophets &amp; Apo|&s;tles &s;uffered for oppo&s;ing tho&s;e Laws which was &s;et up to force Peoples Con&s;ciences in matters of wor&s;hipping God: And all the Martyrs which have &s;uffered the Flames and other Tor|tures ever &s;ince, it has been for manife&s;ting their defiance to &s;uch Laws as have been &s;et up by the worldly Government to uphold fal&s;e Wor&s;hip, or to re&s;train them from wor&s;hipping God according to their Con&s;ciences. Now for as much as God has ju&s;tified all tho&s;e Sufferers above-mentioned, for their bold defiance of &s;uch Laws as were &s;et up by Man to prevent People &s;erving God according to their Con&s;ci|ences, well may we have Confidence that God will ju&s;tify us for the &s;ame thing. We have al|&s;o
<PB N="16" REF="039855_0015_1014910C7503C700">
farther to plead in our own Ju&s;tification in this matter than tho&s;e Sufferers above mention|ed had, in as much as our Lord the King has granted us the &s;ame liberty to meet together and wor&s;hip God according to our Con&s;ciences, as he has given to our Per&s;ecutors: So that in the con&s;ideration of what is here expre&s;t, I think <HI>J.

<P>In his 14th. page he charges the Sufferers to be mo&s;t <HI>daring and malicious Offenders, utterly di&s;re|garding tho&s;e Scriptures,</HI> Rom. 13. Tit. 3. 1 Pet. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> My An&s;wer to the&s;e la&s;t Charges will con&s;i&s;t chiefly in opening the&s;e Scriptures which he has here wre&s;ted, and re&s;toring them to their natural Sen&s;e; by which it will appear, that he is one of tho&s;e <HI>unlearned and un&s;table Souls</HI> &s;poken of 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.16. who <HI>wre&s;t the Scripture to their own De&s;truction.</HI></P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place I &s;hall fully grant from tho&s;e Scriptures, and many more that might be menti|oned, that the worldly Government is &s;et up of God, and are God's Mini&s;ters to act in worldly matters between Man and Man, and that the Law which God hath put into their Hands is good, if they u&s;e it lawfully; that is to Puni&s;h Murtherers of Fathers and Murtherers of Mo|thers, and Man-&s;layers, Whoremongers, and them that defile them&s;elves with Mankind; for Men-&s;tealers, for Liars, for perjured Per&s;ons,
<PB N="17" REF="039855_0016_1014910E289B7260">
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> According to what is written 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.8, 9, 10.</P>
<P>And while the worldly Government act with|in their Commi&s;&s;ion, God is with them, and has put &s;uch Carnal Weapons in their Hands, as is &s;ufficient to rule all Carnal Per&s;ons, which are Stocks, Fines, Pri&s;ons, Whips and Gallows: Which above-named Weapons are &s;ufficient to conquer and &s;ubdue all carnal and guilty Per|&s;ons, &s;o that Rulers are a <HI>Terror to evil doers.</HI> And for as much as we acknowledge the worldly Government to be &s;et up of God, we have al|ways paid all publick Demands for the uphold|ing of the &s;ame; as Town-Rates, County-Rates and Country-Rates, and all other De|mands, excepting &s;uch as are for the upholding of Hireling Mini&s;ters and fal&s;e Teachers, which God has called us to te&s;tify again&s;t. Now when the worldly Rulers take upon them&s;elves to make Laws relating to God's Wor&s;hip, and thereby to force and command Men's Con&s;ci|ences, and &s;o turn their Sword again&s;t God's Children, they then act beyond their Com|mi&s;&s;ion, and out of their Juri&s;diction; and are &s;o far from being God's Mini&s;ters, that they are fighters again&s;t God and his Church; and God is &s;o far from making them a Terror to his Church, that he gives his Church and People Faith and Boldne&s;s to with|&s;tand them to their Faces; Nor are their car|nal Weapons able to overcome God's Children, who&s;e Weapons are not <HI>carnal but mighty, to the pulling down of &s;trong holds,</HI> &amp;c. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.4 And that this is a right Expo&s;ition of all tho&s;e Scrip|tures quoted by him, I &s;hall prove by the&s;e fol|lowing Texts of Scripture; <HI>Dan.</HI> 5.18, 19. <HI>O
<PB N="18" REF="039855_0017_1014910FC521FAE8">
thou King, the mo&s;t high God gave</HI> Nebuchadnezzer <HI>thy Father a Kingdom, and Maje&s;ty, and Glory, and Honour, and for the Maje&s;ty that he gave him, all People Nations and Languages trembled and feared before him,</HI> &amp;c. Thus it appears that <HI>Nebuchad|nezzer</HI> was &s;et up of God to act in the worldly Government, and that God laid a Terror upon all his &s;ubjects to fear and tremble at his Pre&s;ence &s;o long as he acted within the Bounds of his Com|mi&s;&s;ion; but when he exceeded the Bounds of his Commi&s;&s;ion, by acting in matters of Wor|&s;hip which was out of his Juri&s;diction, God's Children publickly with&s;tood him, and open|ly to his Face manife&s;ted their defiance to his Laws: And God was &s;o far from laying his Terror on them, that he gave them Faith pub|lickly to oppo&s;e him; nor was his Carnal Wea|pons able to compel them to attend his fal&s;e Wor&s;hip, as may be &s;een <HI>Dan.</HI> 3.16, 17, 18.

Here Chri&s;t commands his Children to be faith|ful to him, and not to fear them that kill the Body. Now we know that tho&s;e which kill the Bodies of God's Children are the worldly Powers, when they exceed their Commi&s;&s;ion, (which is only to judge in worldly matters) then they turn fighter&punc; again&s;t God, and per|&s;ecute his Children; for the worldly Govern|ment is the Kingdoms of this World, but Chri&s;t's Kingdom is not of this World. <HI>Joh.</HI> 18.36. And when the Man in the Go&s;pel de&s;ired Chri&s;t to &s;peak to his Brother to divide the
<PB N="19" REF="039855_0018_1014911161F106A0">
Inheritance, he refu&s;ed to do it, &s;ignifying it was not his Bu&s;ine&s;s to judge in &s;uch matters. <HI>Luke</HI> 12.13, 14. Nor would he condemn the Woman taken in Adultery, <HI>Joh.</HI> 8. becau&s;e &s;uch Judgment did properly belong to the world|ly Government, and not to Chri&s;t's Kingdom: For Chri&s;t's Church is his Kingdom, and they are not of this World, for he hath cho&s;en them out of the World. <HI>Joh.</HI> 15.19.</P>
<P>And now though I might go on to multiply Scriptures to prove this great Truth, <HI>(viz)</HI> That the worldly Rulers are not impowered by God to act in matters of Wor&s;hip to God, but only in worldly Affairs; yet I mu&s;t de&s;i&s;t at pre&s;ent, for that I only intended Brevity in this &s;mall Volume; but do boldly affirm, that Chri&s;t's Church &s;ince his coming in the Fle&s;h, are no where commanded to be &s;ubject to the worldly Powers relating to God's Wor&s;hip, and &s;o &s;hall forbear at pre&s;ent to enlarge upon this Subject, de&s;iring <HI>Jo&s;eph Backus</HI> (if he be able) to produce Scripture to the contrary.</P>
<P>In the next place it may be needful for the &s;atisfaction of the Reader, to look back and ob&s;erve what are the Crimes which he charges the Sufferers to be guilty of, and which are to be &s;een in his fifth page. The fir&s;t is our pa&s;|&s;ing along the Country Road towards our own Meeting.</P>
<P>The next Crime which he charges us with, is the merciful act in carrying the &s;mall Chair for the Relief of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Child, of which I have already given a particular Account.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="039855_0019_10149114FA68CDF8">The third Crime he charges us with is, That &s;ome of our Company asked &s;ome People if they did not hear that there was a &s;olemn Or|dinance to be Admini&s;tred to Morrow on a Per&s;on at <HI>Lebanon,</HI> according to Chri&s;t's In&s;ti|tution? Now how Criminal the&s;e three Arti|cles will appear in the Eyes of indifferent Per|&s;ons I know not, but doubtle&s;s they &s;eem very great to <HI>J. Backus,</HI> otherwi&s;e he would not have made u&s;e of &s;o much foul and Railing Language again&s;t the Sufferers as he has done throughout his Book; as in page fir&s;t he calls them <HI>Notorious Offenders.</HI> Pape 2d. he charges them to be guilty of <HI>Notorious aggravating Cir|cum&s;tances.</HI> Page 3d. he &s;ays, <HI>The Per&s;on here named, was one of</HI> John Rogers<HI>'s Brethren in Ini|quity and Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion,</HI> and that our de&s;ign for <HI>Lebanon</HI> was <HI>needle&s;ly and perniciou&s;ly.</HI> Page 9th. he calls them <HI>Notorious Malefactors.</HI> Page 10. he calls them <HI>Creatures in human &s;hapes.</HI> Page 19. he calls them Mi&s;creants, or <HI>Infidels,</HI> and char|ges them with tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the Laws of God, but doth not mention what Law of God they were found in the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of. Surely pa&s;&s;ing along the Road to our Meeting, could be no Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the Laws of God, nei|ther could the merciful Deed done to the Child be contrary to any Law of God, neither could our informing our Neighbours concern|ing Chri&s;t's Ordinance be a breach of God's Laws. Now I de&s;ire him to con&s;ider, whether all this evil Communication above-mentioned doth not prove him to be guilty of corrupting good Manners, according to what is written
<PB N="21" REF="039855_0020_10149117840E7F78">
1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.33. <HI>Be not deceived, evil Communicati|ons corrupt good Manners.</HI> Or whether &s;uch Rail|ing doth not prove him to be a Railer, or whe|ther &s;uch Reviling of his Neighbours doth not prove him to be a Reviler, which if he be &s;uch a Per&s;on he may &s;ee 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.10. that no &s;uch Per&s;on &s;hall inherit the Kingdom of God.</P>
<P>In his 24th Page he &s;ignifies, that &s;ome of the People at <HI>Norwich</HI> offered freely to pay the fine for &s;ome of us, and that we refu&s;ed the Kindne&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And that the Week after being &s;entenced at <HI>Lebanon</HI> to undergo the &s;ame Puni&s;hment; that our Courage failed &s;o as to accept a Di&s;charge by other Men's Money, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>To which I an&s;wer, That if he had &s;aid that &s;ome at <HI>Norwich</HI> talked of paying the Fine and did not do it, but at <HI>Lebanon</HI> they actually did pay it, he had then &s;aid Truth; for we were no more active in that matter at <HI>Lebanon,</HI> than we were at <HI>Norwich.</HI></P>
<P>In the latter end of the &s;ame Page, and be|ginning of the 25th. he adds, That we chal|lenged a Di&s;pute on tho&s;e Articles, the <HI>Sabbath</HI> and <HI>Bapti&s;m,</HI> and had a publick Confutation by the Reverend Mr. <HI>Wells</HI> and <HI>Williams,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> Here he boldly a&s;&s;erts, that we had a publick Confutation on tho&s;e Articles the <HI>Sab|bath</HI> and <HI>Bapti&s;m;</HI> but he produceth no better Proof for his A&s;&s;ertion, than his own bare Word, which I think is not a &s;ufficient Proof to &s;atisfy the World that it was really &s;o. How|ever, for the better &s;atisfaction of all Per&s;ons in that matter, we do here freely offer him to

manage tho&s;e two Points again&s;t any two Mi|ni&s;ters which he &s;hall make choice of in <HI>New-England;</HI> either tho&s;e which he has here na|med, or any other, if he knows any more capa|ble than they. And farther, that we will give him his choice to do it either in Writing or publick Di&s;pute; and that we will be at the one half of the Charge to print and publi&s;h it to the World; whereby every one may judge for them&s;elves, and not be confined to his Judg|ment in that matter. And that he may be at no lo&s;s in the matter, we will here &s;tate the Points to be debated.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> We deny that the Name <HI>Sabbath</HI> is any where in Scripture impo&s;ed on the fir&s;t Day of the Week.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> We deny that Chri&s;t or any of his Di&s;ciples have left any Command, Precedent or Example for the keeping the fir&s;t day of the Week as a <HI>Sabbath</HI> or <HI>Holy time</HI> throughout the New-Te&s;tament, or given it any Name &s;uperior to any other day of the Week.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> We affirm from the Scripture, that Water Bapti&s;m was and ought to be Admini&s;|tred by Burying in the Water.</P>
<P>And we utterly deny that there is either Command or Example in Scripture for &s;prink|ling of Infants.</P>
<P>And the&s;e great Truths we are ready to de|fend as above&s;aid.</P>
<P>In his 24th. page he &s;ays, <HI>That as much of Cru|elty as there was in this, (viz.</HI> our whipping,) <HI>&s;ome of them did notwith&s;tanding their &s;ore Backs, zea|lou&s;ly expo&s;e them&s;elves by the like Crime, to the
<PB N="23" REF="039855_0022_1014911BC4FD7B28">
like Puni&s;hment the Week after at</HI> Lebanon&punc;</P>
<P><HI>Reply,</HI> Here he plainly makes it manife&s;t, that his cruel Per&s;ecution wrought no effect upon the Sufferers; but even as it has always been ob&s;erved, that when Per&s;ecutors have act|ed with the mo&s;t Tyranical Cruelty again&s;t God's Children, that God hath at &s;uch times in a &s;pecial manner appeared, by giving Faith and boldne&s;s to his Children to oppo&s;e them in their Delu&s;ions, &s;o that they have never been able to &s;top their Te&s;timony, or hinder God's Work.</P>
<P>Here likewi&s;e it is ob&s;ervable how contrary he is to him&s;elf, and how much he thwarts di|vers Pa&s;&s;ages in the foregoing part of his Book; particularly in the 6th. page where he argues, That if they had not puni&s;hed us for this Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion, they might have had ju&s;t Rea&s;on to conclude that we would have &s;oon proceeded to give them di&s;turbance in the Publick Wor&s;hip of the Sabbath, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>So that his argument in the 6th. page is as if their puni&s;hing us had prevented our farther proceedings of that nature: yet in his 24th. page he plainly confe&s;&s;es, that we did proceed the Week after in the &s;ame nature, notwith|&s;tanding our &s;ore Backs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Al&s;o in the 10th. page where he is labouring to hide the Cruelty of the Whipping, he &s;ays he &s;tood by and &s;aw every Stroke, and di&s;covered not a drop of Blood, &s;ave only from &s;ome &s;trokes with the end of the Whip, under the Arm of &s;ome of them. But in this 24th. page he confe&s;&s;es, that notwith&s;tanding their &s;ore Backs, they did zea|lou&s;ly expo&s;e them&s;elves by the like Crime the
<PB N="24" REF="039855_0023_1014911E4A73C800">
Week after. Now it is certain that what he calls the like Crime was our going the next fir&s;t day to hold our Meeting with our Brethren at <HI>Lebanon,</HI> which was &s;even days after. Now let any one judge, whether it is likely that our Backs could remain &s;ore &s;even days if there had been no Blood drawn, but only by &s;ome &s;trokes under the Arms of &s;ome of us.</P>
<P>But I am willing to put the mo&s;t Charitable Con&s;truction upon the&s;e gro&s;s Contradictions, and that is to &s;uppo&s;e that they are occa&s;ioned by the weakne&s;s of his Memory.</P>
<P>Page 26th. he &s;ays that the word Per&s;ecute &s;ignifies to follow hard after, and when u&s;ed in &s;uch a &s;en&s;e as is here intended, it &s;ignifies to pur&s;ue Men with wild and ungoverned Zeal for malicious de&s;igns upon them for the &s;ake of their Religion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> Here I allow his Expo&s;ition of the word to be right, and then how fully has he proved their proceeding again&s;t us to be Per|&s;ecution, who when they fir&s;t took us up it was I &s;uppo&s;e near a Mile beyond their Meeting-hou&s;e, onward of the Road towards our own Meeting. And &s;everal times &s;ince at <HI>Lebanon,</HI> when we have pa&s;&s;ed by their Meeting-hou&s;e along the Road towards our own Meeting, their Con&s;table has Pre&s;t a con&s;iderable number of Men out of their Meeting-hou&s;e, who with Hor&s;es have followed hard after us with an un|governed zeal, and have &s;topt us and made Pri|&s;oners of us for the &s;ake of our Religion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So that by his own Confe&s;&s;ion their proceeding again&s;t us is Per&s;ecution. In the latter end of
<PB N="25" REF="039855_0024_1014912128294FA0">
the 26th. and beginning of the 27th. page he falls to heaping up a great number of charges again&s;t us, in a very confu&s;ed manner without any proof at all; &s;ome of which I &s;uppo&s;e to be only the fal&s;e Reports which our Enemies have &s;cattered about the World. However, at the end of the&s;e charges he adds, That to per|&s;wade us to forbear, our late honourable Gover|nour hath a&s;&s;ured us, that if we would be quiet and wor&s;hip God in our own way according to our Con&s;ciences, he would puni&s;h any of their People that &s;hould di&s;turb us in our Wor&s;hip. Now for as much as he concludes all his charges with this Article of the Governour, I &s;hall par|ticularly give the Reader an Account of that matter, which is as follows, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And fir&s;t, I grant that the Governour did ac|tually make this Promi&s;e, as fully as <HI>J. Backus</HI> has given it, and that it was in a Publick Court before a multitude of Hearers.</P>
<P>Now &s;ome time after this, <HI>John Rogers,</HI> &s;ince decea&s;ed, and &s;everal of his Society (having as good a Right to <HI>New-London</HI> Meeting-hou&s;e as any in the Town) did propo&s;e to hold our Meeting there at Noon-time, between the Meetings of the other Congregation, &s;o as not to di&s;turb them in either of their Meetings. And accordingly we met there, and finding their Meeting not ended, we &s;tood without Door until their Forenoon Meeting was ended and the People come out, and then <HI>John Rogers</HI> told them that our de&s;ign was to make no di&s;tur|bance,
<PB N="26" REF="039855_0025_10149124D7BE3770">
but to hold our Meeting while they were at Dinner, and when they were ready for their Afternoon Meeting we would de&s;i&s;t and go a|way. Whereupon I heard no Per&s;on manife&s;t any di&s;like of our proceedings. Whereupon <HI>J. Rogers</HI> went into the Seat which the Town Officers &s;eated him in, after the Meeting-hou&s;e was built, and proceeded to Expound a Chapter in the Bible. But in the time of our Meeting, the Con&s;table was &s;ent with a Warrant to break up our Meeting, and was attended with a Rude Company of Men, who began to haul Men and Women out of the Meeting, committing &s;ome to Pri&s;on, as did <HI>Paul</HI> in his unconverted &s;tate, as may be &s;een <HI>Acts</HI> 8.3. And when <HI>Sarah Bolles,</HI> one of our Society, &s;aw the Con&s;table and his attendance carrying her Husband to Pri&s;on by his Legs and Arms, with his Belly downward, in a very Cruel manner, &s;he and <HI>Jo&s;iah Gates,</HI> another of our Society, went to the Governour, minding him of his late Promi&s;e to defend us in our Meetings from any that &s;hould di&s;turb us, and de&s;ired him that her Husband might not be &s;o abu&s;ed, but all the Relief they had, <HI>Jo&s;iah Gates</HI> received a Box on the Ear from the Go|vernour's own Hand, and were both turned out of Doors by the Governour, and the next day the Governour &s;at Judge him&s;elf of the matter, and Bound over <HI>J. Rogers</HI> to the County Court, charging him with a Riot, though all that he did was to Expound a Chapter as afore&s;aid, and all that his People did, was to attend to his Ex|po&s;ition, in as quiet a manner as was ever in any Meeting in the Kings Dominions, till the
<PB N="27" REF="039855_0026_10149129C10F4168">
Con&s;table with his rude Attendance made the de&s;turbance. However the Court fined <HI>J. Ro|gers</HI> Ten Shillings, for which ten &s;hillings and the Charges, Execution was given out, and the Shereff fir&s;t took ten Sheep, and then complain|ed that they were not &s;ufficient to an&s;wer the Fine and Charges, and came a &s;econd time and took a milch Cow out of the Pa&s;ture on the &s;ame account, and &s;o we heard no more about it; by which I &s;uppo&s;e that the Cow and ten Sheep &s;atisfied them for the ten Shillings and Charges. And tho' for brevity I here omit to make any Proof of this matter, yet if <HI>Jo&s;eph Bac|kus</HI> &s;hall pre&s;ume to deny any part thereof, in my next <HI>Reply</HI> I &s;hall prove every Article that I have here a&s;&s;erted. And I do farther add, that I know of no Protection that we have met with from the Authority relating to our Wor&s;hip, but what has been of the &s;ame nature; and I de&s;ire <HI>J. Backus</HI> (if he be able) to make the contrary appear. By which it is manife&s;t, that his end in mentioning this Article of the Governour was to deceive the World, and to mock us.</P>
<P>In his 27th Page he adds as follows, <HI>But if it were Per&s;ecution, how &s;trangely have they forgot that Advice, When they per&s;ecute you in one City, flee into another.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply,</HI> Here he greatly wre&s;ts and abu&s;es the Scripture, for want of a right under&s;tanding thereof: For this Text which he mentions a &s;mall part of, has only reference to a particu|lar Commi&s;&s;ion given by Chri&s;t to his Apo&s;tles,
<PB N="28" REF="039855_0027_1014912B43D650A8">
as may be &s;een <HI>Mat.</HI> 10.5, 6. <HI>The&s;e twelve Je|&s;us &s;ent forth, and commanded them, &s;aying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not. But go rather to the lo&s;t Sheep of the Hou&s;e of I&s;rael,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Thus it appears, that under this Commi&s;&s;ion the Apo&s;tles were &s;trictly commanded to go to none but the Hou&s;e of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and utterly forbidden to go to any other Nation. In the 9th and 10th Ver&s;es he commands them to provide neither <HI>Gold nor Silver,</HI> &amp; <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> Coats, nor Shoes,</HI> &amp;c. By which it <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> under this Commi&s;&s;ion they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> act with all the &s;peed <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> allowing them time to provide Money, not <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">fering them to burthen them&s;elves with Cloath|ing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And in the 23d Ver&s;e he charges them, that if they were per&s;ecuted <HI>in this City, to flee to another: For verily</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>ye &s;hall not have gone over the Cities of I&s;rael, till the Son of Man be come.</HI></P>
<P>Thus it appears, that the Rea&s;on why Chri&s;t &s;ent his Apo&s;tles in &s;uch great ha&s;te at that time, was becau&s;e it was the will of God fir&s;t to proclaim the coming of Chri&s;t, and the glad Tidings of the Go&s;pel to the Hou&s;e of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> before other Nations had the offer of it.</P>
<P>And the Rea&s;on why he did not allow them time to provide Money, nor &s;uffer them to bur|then them&s;elves with Cloathing, and command|ed them not to be &s;topt by Per&s;ecution, but to
<PB N="29" REF="039855_0028_1014912D11913CF8">
flee to the next City with their Me&s;&s;age, was becau&s;e the time that Chri&s;t would publi&s;h him|&s;elf to be the Saviour of the World was &s;o near at hand, that there was not time for the Apo&s;|tles fir&s;t to publi&s;h it in all the Cities of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and therefore the Lord &s;oon after this, &s;ends other Seventy under the &s;ame Commi&s;&s;ion, and with greater Injunctions to make &s;peed than the fir&s;t, for they were forbidden to &s;alute any Man by the way, <HI>Luke</HI> 10.4.</P>
<P>Thus it plainly appears, that this Text of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> has only Reference to that particular <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> on given to the Apo&s;tles at that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"></P>
<P>And there can be no greater abu&s;e of Scrip|ture, than to apply it to wrong ca&s;es; and Chri&s;t is &s;o far from Countenancing his Chil|dren in &s;huning Per&s;ecution for his &s;ake, that he hath commanded them <HI>not to fear them that Kill the Body,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
