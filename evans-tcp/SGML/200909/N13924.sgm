<HEAD>A PREMONITION TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE great light of the world, and the only living and true way to God and happine&s;s, having &s;aid, as in Matt. vii. 13 and 14, <HI>Enter ye in at the &s;traight gate: For wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to de&s;truction; and many there be which go in thereat: For &s;traight is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth to life; and few there be that find it.</HI> He then immediate|ly adds in the two next ver&s;es, <HI>Beware of</HI> fal&s;e prophets, <HI>which come to you in &s;heep's cloathing; but inwardly they are ravening wolves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Ye &s;hall know them by their fruits.</HI></P>
<P>HERE our divine teacher and ma&s;ter gives us to under&s;tand, that they are <HI>fal&s;e prophets,</HI> or teachers, who encourage them, that <HI>enter the wide gate, and walk in the broad way to de&s;truction,</HI> that <HI>they &s;halt all be &s;aved:</HI> And He directs us to <HI>beware of &s;uch fal&s;e teachers,</HI> however fair and innocent they may appear: For they are inimical to the flocks of our Lord.</P>
<P>AND, that &s;o &s;uch <HI>fal&s;e teachers</HI> may be di&s;covered; our Lord, who <HI>knew what was in man, and who indeed knew all men,</HI> acquaints us, that <HI>by their fruits ye &s;hall know them;</HI> which may intend and mean, that ye &s;hall not only <HI>know them by their own fruits,</HI> or from their own irregular, worldly and &s;en&s;ual lives and conver&s;ations; but <HI>ye &s;hall know them</HI> al&s;o by <HI>the fruits of their doctrine:</HI> For their doctrine will &s;urely produce tho&s;e <HI>fruits whereof</HI> the children of men <HI>may well be a&s;hamed;</HI> and of which they may well be afraid,&mdash;for <HI>the end of them will be death,</HI> and even everla&s;ting de&s;truction.</P>
<P>WHEREFORE may <HI>the&s;e things be</HI> duly <HI>con&s;idered</HI> by us: <HI>And the Lord grant us under&s;tanding in all things</HI> to know and practice his will and our duty; that &s;o, being found in <HI>this good old way,</HI> we may obtain and enjoy perfect and everla&s;ting <HI>re&s;t</HI> and happine&s;s;&mdash; while the ungodly and vicious &s;hall be <HI>condemned in judgment, nor &s;uffered an admi&s;&s;ion into the congregation of the righteous.</HI></P>

<HEAD>An <HI>ANSWER</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Title Page noticed.</HEAD>
<P>THE charitable author of the pamphlet, intitled, <HI>Salvation for all Men,</HI> unhappily &s;tumbles and falls at the thre&s;hold of his performance: For even the title page is not without its er|rors.&mdash;It is this, <HI>Salvation for all men illu&s;trated and vindicated as a &s;cripture doctrine.</HI></P>
<P>HAD the writer intended and &s;aid, <HI>Salvation for all men revealed and offered</HI> in the go&s;pel; <HI>this</HI> would have pa&s;&s;ed well enough for a &s;criptural doctrine. But, that <HI>all men &s;hall actually obtain &s;alvation</HI> &s;ooner or later, which is the intent and meaning of this writer; <HI>this</HI> cannot be fairly illu&s;trated from the &s;acred writings; nor can it be truly and hone&s;tly vindicated as a <HI>&s;criptural doctrine.</HI></P>
<P>BUT how is it propo&s;ed to illu&s;trate and vindicate <HI>this?</HI> Not, it &s;hould &s;eem, from the &s;tudies and endeavours of this generous <HI>well-wi&s;her to all mankind;</HI> but <HI>in numerous extracts from a variety of pi|ous and learned men, who have purpo&s;ely written on this &s;ubject; toge|ther with their an&s;wer to the objections urged again&s;t it.</HI></P>
<P>WE are not certain as to the <HI>piety and learning</HI> of the&s;e per&s;ons, to be hereafter quoted by him. The extracts from them afford no &s;uffi|cient evidence of the one or the other. But, were they ever &s;o learn|ed and pious, they were only weak and fallible mortals, like their neighbours: And it will be found, upon due examination, that they have imbibed error, and endeavoured to promote it.</P>
<P>THE author of this pamplet, or the collector of the&s;e various ex|tracts, is plea&s;ed to give him&s;elf <HI>the flattering title</HI> of <HI>One who wi&s;hes well to all mankind.</HI> But his whole farrago of <HI>extracts</HI> gives no &s;ati&s;|factory evidence of his being &s;o: For it is probable, that his ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">racts may prove hurtful and ruinous to many: And, if they &s;hould do &s;o, <HI>his wi&s;hing them well</HI> will make no &s;ufficient amends for it.</P>
<P>THE collector then quotes the &s;peech of <HI>the Angel</HI> to the Shepherds at <HI>Bethlehem.</HI>&mdash;And he is chargeable with a faulty mi&s;application of it: For <HI>the good tidings of great joy,</HI> promulged by the Angel <HI>to all people,</HI> was <HI>the birth of the Saviour,</HI> the CHRIST of GOD: But if
<PB N="6" REF="017603_0005_0FA1DA9F29821558">
this extractor meant to in&s;inuate, as he doubtle&s;s did, that the Angel declared <HI>univer&s;al &s;alvation</HI> to be given <HI>to all people, as matter of great joy</HI> to them; as it is not true, we &s;ee not but that he mu&s;t be taxed as <HI>handling the word of the Lord</HI> by his Angel <HI>deceitfully.</HI></P>
<P>AND now having got over the thre&s;hold, we may go into <HI>the porch,</HI> or the preface, and give a few &s;trictures upon the &s;ame before we en|ter into the dome, that is con&s;tructed of tra&s;h, errors and fal&s;hoods.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Preface con&s;idered.</HEAD>
<P>THE preface begins, That <HI>mankind &s;hall univer&s;ally,</HI> in the final i&s;&s;ue of the go&s;pel plan of mercy, <HI>be de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ivered from the bondage of cor|ruption. and be admitted to the felicity of the &s;ons of GOD,</HI> is no novel doctrine, as many may be ready to imagine. It is very true, as he &s;ays, that <HI>it is no novel doctrine:</HI> But in truth it is an <HI>old error</HI> revived, that has been again and again refuted, and repeatedly exploded; and like <HI>Jonah</HI>'s g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urd, it has <HI>come up in a night, and peri&s;hed in a night.</HI></P>
<P>THEN the preface goes on; it was, as &s;ome writers on the &s;ubject have ob&s;erved, received as a revealed truth by <HI>Origen</HI> and <HI>Clemens of Alexandria,</HI> in the latter end of the &s;econd century.</P>
<P>IN an&s;wer to which it may be &s;aid, that it is que&s;tionable whether <HI>Origen</HI> received this as a revealed truth, that <HI>all men will be &s;aved,</HI> and even <HI>the Devils</HI> too; though he has often been taxed with hold|ing this. For we are well a&s;&s;ured, that one <HI>Ruffians</HI> has taken the unbecoming and licentious liberty with <HI>Origen</HI>'s works to leave out of them, and to add to them, as he plea&s;ed; which, as that learned and judicious writer of <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory,</HI> Mr. <HI>Du Pin,</HI> has ob&s;erved, has occa&s;ioned &s;ome to doubt, whether a great part of tho&s;e works, publi&s;hed under his name, were <HI>Origen</HI>'s or no.</P>
<P>AND as for <HI>Clemens</HI> of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> though he writes indeed of one <HI>Ephe&s;ies,</HI> who learned from barbarous philosophy, that <HI>there is an ex|purgation by fire of them that have lived badly;</HI> yet we do not recollect that he any where writes this as his own &s;entiment, and that he tho't all mankind would be finally happy. And although he writes in his fourth book of <HI>Stromes,</HI> that <HI>when&s;oever &s;inners do repent, whether here in this world, or in the next, they may be received to GOD's mercy;</HI> it mu&s;t be &s;aid, that nothing can be offered from the &s;acred writings to &s;upport it, as to the future world. &mdash;But this his a&s;&s;ertion is not only contrary to the &s;acred &s;criptures, but it &s;hews a forgetful|ne&s;s of what he had written before and is incon&s;i&s;tent with it: For he had before a&s;&s;erted, that <HI>after our calling to the knowledge of the truth, p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">l; GOD might grant to them, that have &s;inned a recovery into their former &s;tate for once or twice by repentance: But if they &s;hould fall oftener into &s;in, then there is no more re&s;titution to be expected or hoped for, but a fearful looking for a final judgment.&mdash;Clemens</HI> there|fore may here be &s;et again&s;t <HI>Clemens.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="017603_0006_0FA1DAA04CB3FFB8">BUT was it really fact, that both the&s;e fathers received and owned this tenet, <HI>the &s;alvation of all,</HI> as an evangelical truth? It mu&s;t be acknowledged however, that they were really but mi&s;taken mortals: And they have actually &s;hewed them&s;elves to be &s;o, by admitting <HI>as a revealed truth,</HI> if they have done &s;o, a palpable error.</P>
<P>IT is then added by the prefacer; <HI>It appears from</HI> Au&s;tin and Je|rom, <HI>and other celebrated writers in their day, that it was not then a new or uncommon tenet.</HI></P>
<P>BUT this is a very fallacious account: And, if the writer of it was acquainted with <HI>Au&s;tin's and Jerom's</HI> works; he writes not hone&s;tly, but with a de&s;ign to deceive: For many, by this account, would be led to think, that tho&s;e fathers were favourers of this tenet of <HI>univer|&s;al &s;alvation:</HI> Whereas <HI>both</HI> of them have written plainly, explicitly and &s;trongly again&s;t it.</P>
<P>THE prefacer then mentions <HI>a variety of books in various languages,</HI> publi&s;hed in favor of this doctrine; and particularly <HI>an ingenious piece</HI> written in French by a noble mini&s;ter in the court of the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> &s;tiled, <HI>A treati&s;e on the univer&s;al re&s;titution of the creation:</HI> What a pity it is, that our prefacer has not favored us with &s;ome ex|tracts from <HI>this ingenious piece?</HI>&mdash;But the&s;e writers that have been mentioned have never yet &s;hewed them&s;elves able to prove, to the &s;a|tisfaction of the wi&s;e and judicious, <HI>the univer&s;al &s;alvation of men and of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>HEREUPON this new writer adds, that there is a <HI>con&s;iderable number of other books on the &s;ame &s;ubject now extant in</HI> Engli&s;h And what then? this is only telling us, what we knew before, that mankind are prone to errors; and they are apt too &s;oon and ea&s;ily both to re|ceive them, and to promote them, as far as they can, among others.</P>
<P>BUT here our prefacer &s;ees cau&s;e to mention one or two, out of many others, as favourers of his charming <HI>doctrine of univer&s;al &s;al|vation.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of the&s;e is "<HI>Jeremiah White,</HI> chaplain to <HI>Oliver Cromwell;</HI> (who, by the way, had no chaplain to his own particular family, nor wanted one; for he always <HI>ble&s;&s;ed his own hou&s;hold;</HI> though he had a <HI>chaplain</HI> for his &s;tate family;) <HI>and an eminently pious good man, who has written a large book in vindication of God's goodne&s;s to be ma|nife&s;ted at la&s;t in the recovery of the whole lower creation from the fall.</HI>" If by <HI>this lower creation,</HI> we under&s;tand the <HI>whole terraqueous globe; this</HI> will undoubtedly be recovered from its pre&s;ent morbid and langui&s;hing condition. But, if it is to be under&s;tood, that all the finally wicked and impenitent will be recovered to perfect hap|pine&s;s; the pious good man has advanced an idle whim and an erro|neous fancy.</P>
<P>THEN after pious good <HI>White,</HI> Dr. <HI>Hartley</HI> is mentioned as a man of known &s;erious piety, who, in his <HI>ob&s;ervations on man, has &s;everal chapters on the &s;alvation of all men:</HI> And it is &s;aid of him, that <HI>he
<PB N="8" REF="017603_0007_0FA1DAA111C06B18">
was a di&s;ciple of Mr.</HI> John We&s;ley; <HI>and, in common with him and all his followers, a believer in the re&s;toration of all mankind in God's time and way to final happine&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>MR <HI>John We&s;ley</HI> may be a precious good man too, as well as the Doctor his di&s;ciple; and the re&s;t of his di&s;ciples may be precious good people al&s;o: With all our hearts.&mdash;But good people may hold errors; and with re&s;pect to the point of doctrine which they are &s;aid to hold, we &s;cruple not to &s;ay, it is an error that is held in common by them, and may endanger the happine&s;s of others, as well as their own.</P>
<P>BUT why mu&s;t good Dr. <HI>Hartley</HI> be introduced and commended for holding this error as a truth? If the real truth of the ca&s;e had been known by this prefacer, he &s;hould have been &s;o fair and candid as to have informed his readers, that the good doctor was &s;trong in the opinion concerning <HI>fatality:</HI> and in order to &s;upport this favou|rite doctrine, he found it nece&s;&s;ary to bring forward, and plead for, the error of the <HI>univer&s;al &s;alvation of men:</HI> And herein he has di&s;|played a con&s;i&s;tence in his errors: For if GOD be the cau&s;e or <HI>author</HI> of all the actions in the world, good and bad; does it not &s;eem fit and right to render the <HI>doers of the bad actions,</HI> as well as good, fi|nally happy? for they have acted by his impul&s;e and according to his will, when they have been di&s;obedient to his commandments.&mdash; Thus, we may &s;ee, that one error prepares the way for the &s;upport of another; as indeed <HI>this doctrine of univer&s;al &s;alvation</HI> opens the door for the reception and maintenance of other errors and delu&s;ions: and therefore all con&s;iderate people have need to be on their guard again&s;t it.</P>
<P>BUT let us now &s;ee, <HI>what</HI> our prefacer &s;ays, <HI>it may not be un&s;ea|&s;onable to add here&punc;</HI> and this is, as follows: <HI>It is freely and fully acknowledged by all the above writers, that</HI> many among the &s;ons and daughters of <HI>Adam</HI> will <HI>pa&s;s through a &s;tate of unutterable mi&s;ery,</HI> before they will be prepared for and admited to, the joys of GOD'S pre&s;ence in the heavenly world.</P>
<P>WHAT a fine di&s;covery have we here! Though it is no novelty. Here are &s;ome per&s;ons, that would be thought by them&s;elves and o|thers <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> who however are repre&s;ented as declaring for the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> doctrine of <HI>purgatory,</HI> though not in plain and explicit terms, yet in truth and reality: for they think, that the wicked, by pa&s;&s;ing through a <HI>&s;tate of unutterable mi&s;ery,</HI> are to be <HI>prepared for a &s;tate</HI> of perfect happine&s;s. And is not this <HI>&s;tate of mi&s;ery</HI> then to be accounted <HI>purgatorial?</HI> Precious doctrine indeed, which can neither profit them that advance it, nor any others! There is however one thing wanting to complete the &s;cheme; and this is, There &s;hould be <HI>certain prie&s;ts</HI> &s;et apart to <HI>&s;ay ma&s;&s;es</HI> for the <HI>re&s;t of their &s;ouls in</HI> purgatory, and <HI>their relea&s;e from it!</HI> And they &s;hould do this kind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ice for them on the account of &s;ome pecuniary con&s;ideration.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="017603_0008_0FA1DAA164FE8520">THIS <HI>&s;tate of unutterable mi&s;ery,</HI> the prefacer judges it proper to mention as <HI>taking place before the re&s;toration</HI> of the wicked to happi|ne&s;s; becau&s;e, as he acquaints us, <HI>a &s;tranger</HI> under the a&s;&s;umed character of a preacher in direct contradiction, not only to all the writers before-mentioned, but to the whole tenor of the new te&s;ta|ment books, has <HI>held forth the doctrine of univer&s;al &s;alvation; and, according to him, a man may go to heaven, notwith&s;tanding all the &s;ins that he has been guilty of in the cour&s;e of his life.</HI></P>
<P>BUT <HI>wherein he judges another, does he not condemn his own &s;elf?</HI> For is it not the plain and manife&s;t tendency of the doctrine col|lected by our extracter to &s;hew forth <HI>the univer&s;al &s;alvation of men,</HI> and even the very wor&s;t of them, after &s;ome intervening and <HI>unutter|able puni&s;hment:</HI> And where then is the mighty difference between <HI>this &s;tranger</HI> and this novel extracter? For they converge and meet in the &s;ame point of doctrine, <HI>the &s;alvation of all.</HI></P>
<P>AND yet our prefacer &s;ays, with a placid air and a great deal of a&s;&s;urance &s;uch a doctrine <HI>looks very like an encouragement to liberti|ni&s;m; and falls in with the &s;cheme of too many in this degenerate age; who, under pretence of promoting religion, undermine it at the very root.</HI></P>
<P>WITHOUT critici&s;ing here on the <HI>undermining of a root</HI> in&s;tead of a <HI>foundation;</HI> we will venture to &s;ay, that not only the doctrine of the wandering <HI>&s;tranger</HI> but the <HI>&s;trange doctrine of our extracter,</HI> whether he has the <HI>real</HI> or <HI>a&s;&s;umed character of a preacher</HI> or not, <HI>not only looks like,</HI> but they both really and in fact are <HI>encouragements to libertini&s;m:</HI> And, if they &s;hould be generally received and enter|tained, they not only <HI>may,</HI> but certainly <HI>will, prove as hurtful to civil &s;ociety as to religion.</HI></P>
<P>HEREUPON the preface writer delivers a pathetic wi&s;h; <HI>would to GOD it might be realized as an undoubted truth, that there is the &s;ame rea&s;on to believe there is a Hell, as a Heaven.</HI>&mdash;And may we not take leave to add our fervent wi&s;h? Would to GOD it might be realized, that there is the &s;ame rea&s;on from &s;cripture to believe, that <HI>the puni&s;hment of the wicked in Hell will be eternal,</HI> as there is to believe, that <HI>the happine&s;s of the righteous</HI> in Heaven will be &s;o? For the very &s;ame terms are u&s;ed for the <HI>former</HI> as for the latter. And we unite with the preface writer in &s;aying, that tho&s;e, who are <HI>infidels</HI> as to <HI>the former, would do well to take care, le&s;t they &s;hould know from their own experience the horrors,</HI> and we add <HI>the eternal ones,</HI> of that dreadful place.</P>
<P>THE prefacer lets us know, that the following doctrine, held forth in his extracts, <HI>is capable of being perverted and abu&s;ed: Which,</HI> he &s;ays <HI>is the truth with every other doctrine.</HI>&mdash;And we are taught to conceive, that the chri&s;tian religion is <HI>the doctrine according to God|line&s;s:</HI> And we have cau&s;e to be per&s;uaded, that <HI>every truth</HI> of this religion is calculated and adapted to promote piety and virtue: Whereas every error and fal&s;hood has a contrary tendency: And
<PB N="10" REF="017603_0009_0FA1DAA25BAB0200">
this verily is the ea&s;e of <HI>that particular error,</HI> which is held forth by our <HI>well wi&s;hing</HI> extracter. And, if any <HI>turn the grace,</HI> which our prefacer intends to magnify, <HI>into wantonne&s;s;</HI> while they may re|flect proper <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> on them&s;elves,</HI> they may po&s;&s;ibly <HI>bla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e and cur&s;e him,</HI> who has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rawn and led them on to a &s;tate of <HI>unutterable</HI> and long <HI>puni&s;hment,</HI> even for ages of ages, <HI>and to an awful degree of it.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, after getting over the thre&s;hold, and pa&s;&s;ing through the por<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h, we come now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nto <HI>the hou&s;e it&s;elf, the building of hay and &s;tubble,</HI> that is not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> put together, nor will be able to &s;tand the trial.</P>

<P>THE pamphlet, intitled, <HI>Salvation for all men,</HI> is aptly de&s;igned and accommodated to make bad men ea&s;y, and cau&s;e them to conti|nue deceived and hardened in their wicked and vicious choices and ways; and to unhinge the minds of &s;erious and well di&s;po&s;ed per|&s;ons from the truth, on which they were &s;ettled, and to betray them into errors, iniquity and ruin.</P>
<P>IT may probably therefore be of &s;ome con&s;equence and advantage to take this in&s;idious pamphlet into a &s;erious and impartial con&s;ide|ration, and to &s;hew the erroneous and wrong notions that are con|veyed in it and by it. And as this has been reque&s;ted by a number of &s;erious, virtuous and godly per&s;ons; hence it has been underta|ken.</P>
<P>THE author of the pamphlet would have us to think him contra|ry and oppo&s;ite to the notion that has been carried about by a &s;tran|ger from <HI>England,</HI> who, in&s;tead of following the bu&s;ine&s;s of the world, has been <HI>preaching up the general &s;alvation of all mankind,</HI> without any future puni&s;hment at all for the wicked; for, according to him, as it is &s;aid, their follies and crimes will be laid on <HI>the De|vil:</HI> And he therefore alone will bear the puni&s;hment of them.</P>
<P>BUT although this author appears to be aver&s;e to the doctrine of this <HI>&s;tranger;</HI> and he owns and profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf to be <HI>a believer of the puni&s;hment of the wicked in the future &s;tate;</HI> yet he is plainly for <HI>confining this puni&s;hment,</HI> however &s;evere and unutterable, <HI>to a limited &s;ea&s;on:</HI> And he has ran&s;acked &s;ome books, and produced &s;ome authorities, to &s;upport his hypothe&s;is and to gain it a favoura|ble reception among mankind.</P>
<P>NOW we &s;hall take &s;ome proper notice of his plau&s;ible &s;ayings; and we &s;hall con&s;ider and animadvert on his produced authorities: which, <HI>what&s;oever they are, it maketh no matter to us: GOD accepteth no man's per&s;on:</HI> He calleth whom he will to his &s;ervice; and he di&s;|pen&s;es his gifts and benefits to whom&s;oever he plea&s;es</P>
<P>THE doctrine of the future &s;tate of puni&s;hment, as to <HI>the eternity of it,</HI> if not as to <HI>the extremity</HI> of it, &s;eems by &s;ome accounts to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> been attacked in the beginning of the <HI>&s;econd century</HI> from the birth

of our Lord. However it &s;tood its ground again&s;t the gain &s;ayers at that time and afterwards. And both <HI>Au&s;tin,</HI> the celebrated mi|ni&s;ter of <HI>Hippo</HI> in <HI>Africa&punc;</HI> and the learned Father <HI>Jerom.</HI> bare their te&s;timony again&s;t it, as having an unhappy tendency to promote and encourage all manner of vice and wickedne&s;s and a continuance in the &s;ame.</P>
<P>BUT &s;ince tho&s;e early times of chri&s;tianity, this doctrine of <HI>the eternal duration of the puni&s;hment</HI> of the wicked has been oppo&s;ed at one time and another by &s;ome particular per&s;ons; and it has been &s;o particularly in the pre&s;ent century, as well as in that pre|ceeding it: However it has not yet been &s;ubverted; but it has &s;tood its ground; Nor is it to be overthrown by any thing we have yet &s;een advanced again&s;t it, nor will it be overturned: For <HI>the truth is great</HI> and &s;trong; and though for a &s;ea&s;on there my be a running upon it and a &s;triving again&s;t it, <HI>it will &s;urely prevail</HI> and &s;tand &s;e|cure.</P>
<P>BUT, in order to its &s;tanding and prevailing again&s;t oppo&s;ition, it is highly proper and requi&s;ite, that &s;ome one or other &s;hould &s;et <HI>the pre&s;ent truth</HI> in a fair light, prove it a chri&s;tian doctrine, and endeavour to e&s;tabli&s;h wavering chri&s;tians in the faith of it, left, <HI>being led away with the error</HI> of the deceiving or <HI>the wicked, they &s;hould fall from their &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>THE collector of other men's &s;entiments begins with acquainting us, that <HI>after &s;ome pertinent ob&s;ervations;</HI> [for the pertinence of which, as we have not the book, we mu&s;t implicitly rely on his judgment and &s;aying] the pious and ingenious Mr. <HI>White</HI> proceeds in the following manner, &amp;c &mdash;Here, as the extract is large, it is ra|ther too long to write: And there is no need of it, e&s;pecially as there is no argument and convictive evidence to &s;upport it. We &s;hall only &s;ay at pre&s;ent of the long extract, that it is a meerly fan|ciful harangue, in a declamatory way and with a great flow of words, to &s;hew what a love he has for mankind and how plea&s;ed he is wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h the notion, that <HI>they are all like to be happy.</HI> And as this appears to be a favourite and mo&s;t beautiful tenet to this ingenious ma&s;ter <HI>White,</HI> he di&s;covers him&s;elf to be dotingly fond of it: for it removes vari|ous difficulties; it is ravi&s;hing to his own heart; it is a mo&s;t com|fortable doctrine for the human race; and, according to his view of it, very honorary to the divine being.</P>
<P>THIS fine introduction of Mr. ingenious <HI>White,</HI> which our collec|tor &s;ays <HI>breathes a &s;pirit of piety and benevolence,</HI> is however only a &s;pecious and plau&s;ible repre&s;entation of error: nor is there any thing in it but fancy and flouri&s;h to &s;upport and e&s;tabli&s;h the truth of it.</P>
<P>AND as the extracter him&s;elf is aware of this, he therefore re|marks, that, <HI>after the ending of this introduction, our author</HI> (he pi|ous Mr. <HI>White) proceed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to confirm the doctrine of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n univer&s;al re&s;|toration of the human race by a variety of te&s;timonies from</HI> &s;cripture.

will endeavour to give the ideas of the author in as few words as po&s;+&s;ible.</HI> We may take it very well, that he has kindly promi&s;ed not to be tedious: and we &s;hall u&s;e our endeavours to &s;hew, in as few words as po&s;&s;ible, that Mr. <HI>White,</HI> with all his ingenuity, has mi&s;ta|ken and mi&s;interpreted the meaning of tho&s;e &s;criptural te&s;timonies, and we &s;hall produce much &s;uperior and more e&s;tabli&s;hed authorities than his that he has not given the right &s;en&s;e and meaning of them.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t text that he produces is found, 1 Tim. ii. 3.4. <HI>God our Saviour, who will have all men to be &s;aved, and come to the know|ledge of the truth.</HI> Upon which Mr. <HI>White</HI> ob&s;erves that the <HI>letter of this text is full and expre&s;s: God will have all men to be &s;aved: And &s;hould we pre&s;s it, there are almo&s;t as many arguments as words.</HI> For 1&s;t, it is not &s;aid, that <HI>God would have all men to be &s;aved by his good will,</HI> but that <HI>he authoritatively wills it; wills it</HI> as a being of &s;upreme, uncontroulable power; a being, that will be obeyed in+&s;pite of the corrupt di&s;po&s;itions of men or the mi&s;chievous arts of de|vils: It is <HI>a fixed, determinate immutable will, not tran&s;ient nor re|vokable: Thus powerfully and irre&s;i&s;tably does God will all men to be &s;aved.</HI> This is all <HI>gratis dictum,</HI> freely &s;aid of his own head&punc; and has no truth in it: For God has no where &s;aid in his word, that he <HI>authoritatively wills the &s;alvation of all men,</HI> &s;o as powerfully and irre&s;i&s;tably to effect it. But he goes on, <HI>As God wills the end, he wills the nece&s;&s;ary means leading to it: he will have all men come to the knowledge of the truth:</HI> For, <HI>no man is or can be &s;anctified and &s;aved without the knowledge of the truth</HI> &mdash;And further <HI>he</HI> remarks that <HI>this will has its ground in the e&s;&s;ential benevolence of the divine nature.</HI> And to what does this amount, but <HI>that God is not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h?</HI> And he has therefore <HI>furni&s;hed them with the means of grace and &s;alvation.</HI> But, as to God's ab&s;olutely, powerfully and irre&s;i&s;tably willing it, &s;o as that it &s;hall certainly and infallibly take place, the <HI>word of God &s;ays no &s;uch thing:</HI> and he not only <HI>adds to the word of God in &s;aying as he has, but he palms an untruth</HI> upon it.&mdash;And yet to his corrupt fancy he applies, 1 Tim. vi. 13. that, <HI>God quickens all things:</HI> which intends and means, that <HI>he</HI> from his quickning influence <HI>maketh all things that are living, to be alive:</HI> which is nothing to his purpo&s;e. And then, &s;ays he, our &s;aviour tells us, <HI>all things live to God&punc;</HI> as in Luke xx. 38: which is in Greek <HI>Pantes, all,</HI> not things; but it means men, particularly the <HI>pious and faithful Patriarchs</HI> before mentioned: and this is far from his in|tention and meaning: but there is one thing, which follows, that is quite inexcu&s;eable. Mark, &s;ays he, <HI>who is this Saviour,</HI> i. e. of all men? <HI>It is GOD, and not CHRIST.</HI> Let us only look into 1 Tim. ii. 3, and we &s;hall &s;ee who is <HI>God our Saviour:</HI> And we &s;hall &s;ee, that in the <HI>Greek</HI> it runs, <HI>in the &s;ight of the Saviour our GOD:</HI> and &s;ervants are enjoined to <HI>&s;hew all good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of GOD our Saviour in all things,</HI> in Tit. ii. 10. But it is in the <HI>Greek,</HI> that <HI>they may adorn the doctrine of the Saviour, our GOD in all things:</HI> And how contrary is this to the interpretation of Mr. <HI>White,</HI> as well as other Arians. However it is <HI>the truth as it is in Je&s;us,</HI> the &s;aviour GOD, and <HI>worthy of acceptation.</HI></P>

<P>OUR extracter then tells us, that our author Mr. <HI>White,</HI> further illu&s;trates his rea&s;oning by the following words: <HI>For there is one God and one mediator between God and man, the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all, to be te&s;tified in due time;</HI> as at the 5th and 6th ver&s;es. 1. <HI>There is one GOD,</HI> or more properly as he &s;ays, <HI>God is one.</HI> Though it is more literally and exactly in the Greek, <HI>one God</HI> This he &s;trangely explains, <HI>all men, reprobated as well as elect, have one and the &s;elf &s;ame GOD.</HI> But, if he means, that <HI>GOD is the &s;elf-&s;ame GOD to the reprobate,</HI> as well as to the elect, to ble&s;s them and make them eternally happy; he is gro&s;ly mi&s;taken him&s;elf, and he tries to deceive others by it.&mdash;Again, 2. <HI>The Mediator is al&s;o one:</HI> And he interprets it, that <HI>He is the Me|diator between GOD and all men: He is not nearer to one party of the human race than another.</HI> But he &s;ays more than he has au|thority from the text to &s;ay, and he &s;infully adds to it. &mdash;And, 3. This Mediator <HI>gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all.</HI> And, as the greate&s;t part of mankind have no benefit from it now, <HI>the time will come when the happy effects of it will be univer&s;ally felt and mo&s;t illu&s;tri|ou&s;ly di&s;played.</HI> For which rea&s;on the apo&s;tle adds, <HI>to be te&s;tified in

And we &s;hall now g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the genuine intent and meaning of it. If the words be ju&s;tly tran&s;lated, the &s;en&s;e will be. <HI>There is one God and one mediator of God and man, the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us:</HI> And &s;o it &s;ignifies, <HI>that the mediator in both God and man. But we may note that the</HI> learned Mr. <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tterfield</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> propo&s;&s;ed this tran&s;lation of the words, which it mu&s;t b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, an&s;wers word for word to the <HI>Greek The one GOD the one who is al&s;o mediator of GOD and man, is the man CHRIST JESUS</HI> So then <HI>the man CHRIST JESUS,</HI> who is <HI>the mediator,</HI> is GOD, as well as man; &s;o that he is GOD and man united. But although this mediator <HI>has given him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all:</HI> For it mu&s;t be granted, that he has given <HI>a &s;ufficient ran&s;om and propitiation for all;</HI> and he <HI>will not ca&s;t out abroad any,</HI> who penitently come to him as he requires, to gain and enjoy the benefit of it; yet it is no where &s;aid that they, who <HI>will not come to him for life</HI> and happine&s;s <HI>&s;hall en|joy the benefit of</HI> his ran&s;om and propitiation. And, whereas Mr. <HI>White,</HI> who may be called <HI>an interpreter, one of a thou&s;and</HI> for in|terpreting ami&s;s, has explained <HI>to be te&s;tified in due time</HI> that <HI>there &s;hall a time come when the reconciliation &s;hall finally operate on all,</HI> &amp;c. he has egregiou&s;ly erred from the truth: For the&s;e words re|fer to what went before: And according to the learned <HI>Grotius,</HI> they &s;ignify, that <HI>CHRIST gave him&s;elf to death as a ran&s;om</HI> in the proper &s;ea&s;on; and that not merely that he might <HI>yield a te&s;timony to the truth of his doctrine;</HI> but that he might lay down his life <HI>in the proper time and &s;ea&s;on, of which the prophets predicted:</HI> And this appears to be all that is meant by it.</P>
<P>AND then, there is another text, produced by our author that is, Mr. <HI>White,</HI> in 1 Tim. iv. 10, <HI>The living GOD, who is the Saviour of all men; e&s;pecially of tho&s;e that believe.</HI> Here he allows, <HI>that GOD is the common Saviour of the whole human race;</HI> and particu|larly of them that <HI>believe the go&s;pel of his &s;on.</HI> But although <HI>be|lievers have the advantage above other men;</HI> yet this does not prove that <HI>GOD is not their Saviour: Becau&s;e he condemne them to &s;uf|fering, he has not ca&s;t them off.</HI> His meaning is, that <HI>GOD will be their final and eternal Saviour.</HI></P>
<P>WE have now heard with one ear what our extractor has errone|ou&s;ly told us: And let us now open the other ear that we may gain the right &s;en&s;e of that pa&s;&s;age. <HI>Grotius</HI>'s explication of it, which is preferable to Mr. <HI>White</HI>'s, is&punc; <HI>the living GOD will have all men to be &s;aved if they believe: But he will &s;ave chri&s;tians, becau&s;e they believe; to wit, if their faith be efficacious by love</HI> &mdash;But <HI>Corne|lius a Lapide,</HI> a learned Je&s;uit, interprets it, and very ju&s;tly as we

<P>THEN Mr <HI>White,</HI> according to our extractor, &s;ays, if we turn to 1 Cor xv 22 &amp;c. we &s;hall &s;ee this matter cleared up. But, if we are not mi&s;taken, his interpretation will only <HI>enlighten our minds with a beam of darkne&s;s,</HI> as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n ancient writer has expre&s;&s;ed it. The text is, <HI>As in Adam all die; &s;o in CHRIST &s;hall all be made alive:</HI> This is interpreted for us, that <HI>believers will be rai&s;ed to everla&s;ting lif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> at CHRIST's &s;econd coming: And unbelievers will be rai&s;ed too, but only to puni&s;h them in Hell: And when their puni&s;hment &s;hall have a proper effect,</HI> i. e. &s;uch an effect as Mr. <HI>White</HI> plea&s;es; they <HI>will then be recovered to the &s;ame happine&s;s with the &s;aints.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is certainly nothing of this &s;ort &s;aid in the text: nor is there any thing offered in it from which it may be ju&s;tly argued. The mo&s;t, that can be gathered from it is, that <HI>as in</HI> Adam <HI>all died, &s;o in Chri&s;t &s;hall all be made alive;</HI> i. e. by a <HI>re&s;urrection from the dead</HI> But it may be ju&s;tly remarked here; that the latter clau&s;e may be read; &s;o <HI>in Chri&s;t all,</HI> or, <HI>all in Chri&s;t &s;hall be made alive.</HI> And the learned Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI> has very well paraphra&s;ed it; and we mu&s;t be allowed to &s;ay, we think better than Mr. <HI>White,</HI> that <HI>all of his nature and &s;pirit &s;hall be made alive.</HI> And &s;o indeed it follows: <HI>In CHSIST all &s;hall be made alive.</HI> How? it follows, <HI>every man in his own order, Chri&s;t the fir&s;t fruits; afterwards they that are Chri&s;t</HI>'s <HI>at his coming;</HI> and no others are mentioned.</P>
<P>BY our collector we are referred to the ingenious <HI>White</HI> for his next quotation, and the &s;en&s;e of it. This is out of Rom. v. from ver&s;e 15 to 19. Upon which, having made his own remarks, he forms this conclu&s;ion, <HI>Here you &s;ee grace has the preference in the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot: GOD hath a de&s;ign to &s;hew his wrath, and to make his power known,</HI> i e for a &s;ea&s;on; for that appears to be his meaning; <HI>but more to glorify his grace.</HI> And he tells us at the bottom of the 11th page, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hen he &s;hall have exhibited acts of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t univer|&s;al grace, GOD will be viewed with admiration by the whole intelli|ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t creation, and celebrated with the loude&s;t anthems of prai&s;e.</HI> But will there not be cau&s;e for the highe&s;t admiration and prai&s;e, when

<P>BUT the plain &amp; natural &s;en&s;e of the words according to various learned authors, may be given thus, that it is the divine de&s;ign and intention, under the <HI>di&s;pen&s;ation of the go&s;pel,</HI> here called in the Greek, <HI>the di&s;pen&s;ation of the filling up of the &s;ea&s;ons, to rec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pitulate;</HI> to bring them by a penitent faith to a reconciliation to God, and &s;o to good terms with all the heavenly beings, and to bring them thus to an union, and good agreement among them&s;elves: thus heaven and earth will be reconciled.: And they are thus in Chri&s;t, as <HI>the head</HI> recapitulated and gathered together in one. And it mu&s;t be putting a &s;trange force on the words to make them &s;ignify <HI>the re&s;to|ration</HI> of the wicked and impenitent to the divine favour and ever|la&s;ting happine&s;s: They are not adapted to convey any &s;uch wrong apprehen&s;ion, only to &s;uch as are fond of errors and delu&s;ions, and love deceit.</P>
<P>BUT now let us hear in&s;tead of Mr. <HI>White,</HI> what the learned and judicious <HI>Beza</HI> has to &s;ay, on Col. i. 20. Now he under&s;tands it <HI>of the whole church,</HI> which, contains in it <HI>things in heaven and things in earth.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="017603_0016_0FA1DC935A9E0A88">ORIGIN, as it has been &s;aid, gathered from <HI>this,</HI> but very unad|vi&s;edly that it would &s;ome time come to pa&s;s, <HI>that damned men and devils would be reconciled to God and &s;aved.</HI> But the mo&s;t di&s;cern|ing learned and judicous interpreters both <HI>Prote&s;tant and Roman Catholic,</HI> under&s;tand it, that <HI>God by the &s;hedding of the blood of his &s;on on the cro&s;s, has reconciled all to him&s;elf both in heaven and earth, and men as well as angels.</HI></P>
<P>AND we may add here the interpretations which the learned and judicious Mr <HI>Dail<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&eacute;</HI> has given of this text: which is, <HI>the will of GOD was to reconcile things on earth and in Heaven by his &s;on,</HI> and reduce all the parts of the univer&s;e unto good terms each with the other: This great work is begun; the foundations of it are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">; the pledges of it are given us; but it will not be perfectly accom|pli&s;hed until the <HI>latter day;</HI> when the world, free from <HI>the bondage un|der which it yet groaneth</HI> &s;hall be entirely changed; <HI>its new Hea|vens, and its new earth,</HI> and its new elements, with the angels and the &s;aints, and all the other parts of the world, con&s;piring together in eternal concord and in inviolable corre&s;pondence to the glory of their common creator, who, as the apo&s;tle &s;ays, &s;hall then <HI>be all in all.</HI> Thus he.</P>
<P>AND it is very &s;ure and certain be&s;ides, that the be&s;t expo&s;itors, both ancient and modern, who&s;e expo&s;itions we need not tarry to annex to tho&s;e that we have mentioned have not given &s;uch a <HI>lati|tod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nary expo&s;ition</HI> of this text as this extraordinary benev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt wri|ter has done, without any good rea&s;on; but only from a partial at|tachment to his own un&s;criptural notion.</P>
<P>GOD extracter here clo&s;es his quotations from this author by &s;ay|ing <HI>Thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uch for</HI> the excellent <HI>Jeremiah White.</HI> But we &s;ee, that <HI>his excellency for interpreting is not di&s;covered and manife&s;ted:</HI> And they may well be a&s;hamed, who have laid any great &s;tre&s;s and pla|ced any dependance, on the fanciful interpretations of &s;uch a whim|&s;ical brain.</P>
<P>AND we are now to proceed to another author, who&s;e te&s;timonies for <HI>univer&s;al &s;alvation</HI> from the &s;criptures are to be noticed by us: This author is indeed a namele&s;s one: And we &s;hall produce au|thors of name and eminence to &s;hew, that he has not aright under|&s;tood and interpreted the&s;e &s;criptural te&s;timonies.</P>
<P>ANOTHER portion of &s;cripture, proceeds our extractor, mentioned by another writer may be found in 1 Corinth. xv. from 24th to 28th ver&s;e. And this writer thinks <HI>it is here mo&s;t peremptorily affir|med, that univer&s;al &s;ubjection to CHRIST &s;hall be effected: And the affirmation,</HI> he &s;ays, is expre&s;&s;ed in a variety of as &s;trong and exten|&s;ive terms as could have been u&s;ed, as <HI>by putting down all rule, all authority, and all power; by putting all enemies and all things under his feet,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>BUT there are very learned men be&s;ides <HI>Grotius,</HI> who, by <HI>the all rule, principality and power, that are to be put down,</HI> under&s;tand <HI>all
<PB N="18" REF="017603_0017_0FA1DC941BDB2638">
the empires and kingdoms of the world, and all the le&s;&s;er governments.</HI> And when it is &s;aid, that after the <HI>&s;ubjection of the&s;e the &s;on him&s;elf will become &s;ubject:</HI> they under&s;tand the meaning of it to be, that the glorious &s;on of GOD will be as <HI>an amba&s;&s;ador,</HI> who, having laid a&s;ide the bu&s;ine&s;s and burthen of his emba&s;&s;y, will &s;till retain his pri&s;tine dignity and glory.</P>
<P>AND it may be advi&s;eable here to give out in a particular manner the &s;entiments of the excellent <HI>Wit&s;ius,</HI> excellent and celebrated both for learning and piety: Now the&s;e are his thoughts, that the divine, e&s;&s;ential and natural kingdom of the Me&s;&s;iah is nothing &s;hort of eter|nal: Dan. iv. 34 That the manhood of the Me&s;&s;iah will be for|ever per&s;onally united to his Godhead, and will therein enjoy a glory far above all the creatures of GOD: Phil 11 8: That the Me&s;&s;iah will be forever <HI>the head of the church;</HI> and con&s;idered, ac|knowledged and celebrated by it, as being <HI>the head,</HI> the mo&s;t illu&s;|trious member of that body; and finally, that there will be ever|la&s;ting effects of the Me&s;&s;iah's mediatorial kingdom; &s;uch as the ef|fulgence of the Divine maje&s;ty and glory in the per&s;on of the GOD man, and the full deliverance of the people of GOD from all their enemies and afflictions; and e&s;pecially the full abolition of all their &s;ins. This ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of the people of GOD will be forever ac|knowledged as obtained by the Me&s;&s;iah and the &s;pirit inhabiting the faithful. And our apo&s;tle makes it his de&s;ign every where to e&s;ta|bli&s;h the&s;e things. But, after the day of judgment, and <HI>at the end, the mediatorial kingdom</HI> of our Lord will come into other circum|&s;tances. <HI>Fir&s;t, the pre&s;ent oeconomy will be at an end: All rule,</HI> as it now is, <HI>&s;hall be put down.</HI> Then, our Lord will give an account concerning the con&s;ummation of his whole <HI>mediatorial undertaking</HI> to obtain and apply the &s;alvation of his church, and pre&s;ent it with|out defect to him, the Father: And this may be meant by <HI>deliver|ing up the kingdom to GOD.</HI> And then, as <HI>all &s;in,</HI> with all the con|&s;equences of it, will be removed; there appears not to be any fur|ther need of a mediator, which <HI>there will be until then</HI> It &s;eems therefore, that the Deity will now more immediately make its com|munications to the ble&s;&s;ed, as unto the angels: which favor will be forever owned as owing to the merits of their Saviour: Thus <HI>GOD will be all in all.</HI> And in fine, our Lord in his human nature, cea|&s;ing from his mediatorial function, that he had faithfully di&s;charged, <HI>will be &s;ubject to GOD,</HI> with his brethren, and at the head of them, <HI>in the mo&s;t excellent glory,</HI> and without any diminution of the glory, which he now enjoys. And we &s;hall conclude with giving you the learned <HI>Wit&s;ius</HI>'s compari&s;on for it; <HI>As any &s;on of a king, who goes from his father with the highe&s;t power to &s;ubdue rebels and vindicate citizens from the tyrannical u&s;urpation, having happily ac|compli&s;hed the bu&s;ine&s;s according to the plea&s;ure of the father, and laying a&s;ide the laborious empire, of which there is now no further u&s;e; he will now and henceforth &s;ecurely live in the delights of the royal court.</HI> Thus <HI>the &s;on him&s;elf will al&s;o become &s;ubject.</HI> And, as the
<PB N="19" REF="017603_0018_0FA1DC94DC23A4D0">
<HI>mediatorial kingdom</HI> of our Lord &s;uppo&s;es and intimates &s;ome im|perfection in his church; <HI>this wi&s;e and good end of it,</HI> makes not for the di&s;honor, but for <HI>the glory, of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord</HI> and Saviour.</P>
<P>WE have be&s;ides at hand the accounts, which the Baron <HI>Pu&s;&s;en|dorf,</HI> and &s;undry others of eminence for learning and piety, have given of this place, that are quite different from the crude and loo&s;e no ions of this author. But we apprehend, that truth enough has been offered to &s;hew the error and fal&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y of the notions of this un|known author.</P>
<P><HI>THERE is another</HI> text, &s;ays our extracter, <HI>produced by the &s;ame author,</HI> which is <HI>the very fir&s;t, that reveals the promi&s;e of a Saviour and &s;ummarily comprehends the whole of what has been &s;aid concerning the reduction of mankind univer&s;ally to an obedient &s;ubjection to the go|verning will of GOD.</HI> Such, alas! is the ignorance and fooli&s;hne&s;s of &s;ome among mankind, that when they have embraced any particu|lar notion and mere whim&s;y in religion, they &s;oon contract a fond|ne&s;s for it: And they will then apply as many pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture as they can, and put them to the rack and torture, to make them confe&s;s their favorite opinion.</P>
<P>THUS this unknown writer will have this pa&s;&s;age in <HI>Gene&s;is</HI> to be under&s;tood as conveying his own &s;en&s;e and corroborating of it; becau&s;e he has a mind that it &s;hall do &s;o; which &s;en&s;e of his is, in a narrow compa&s;s, that <HI>&s;in &s;hall be totally de&s;troyed by the reduction of all men under moral &s;ubjection to GOD.</HI></P>
<P>BUT there is not the lea&s;t countenance given to this fancy in the text: It is all the forgery of his own brain from it: All, that can be fairly and hone&s;tly gathered from this pa&s;&s;age is, that after the apo&s;tacy, there <HI>was an enmity commenced between the woman and the &s;erpent, and between his &s;eed and hers.</HI> Now <HI>the &s;eat,</HI> where in the con|trover&s;y ari&s;ing from <HI>this enmity</HI> will be maintained, is the pre&s;ent world. And the only que&s;tion is, who &s;hall get the better? Now it is mo&s;t certain, that <HI>the &s;eed of the woman</HI> will be victorious over the devil; and he will <HI>de&s;troy all the works of the devil:</HI> And when he comes to judge and rule the world at the la&s;t day; he will <HI>cau&s;e the earth and the works therein to be burnt up:</HI> When <HI>the &s;in|ners &s;hall be con&s;umed out of the earth and the wicked be no more,</HI> as in P&s;alm. civ. 34. And, after the conflagration, and the re&s;toration of the earth to a paradi&s;aic &s;tate, <HI>the earth will be a new one, where|in &s;hall dwell righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> This is the &s;en&s;e which the learned <HI>Comenius</HI> thinks, that this pa&s;&s;age in <HI>Gene&s;is</HI> affords to us: And other learned men are very well &s;atisfied with this interpretation of it: And it has certainly more truth in it, and is more worthy of re|ception with us, than the bold and yet weak imagination and flou|ri&s;hing of our extracted author.</P>
<P>AND now we come to <HI>another text from this &s;ame writer and the la&s;t,</HI> &s;ays the extracter, <HI>that I &s;hall bring to view:</HI> It is recorded Rev. v. 13. The&s;e words, our author ob&s;erves, <HI>evidently look for|ward
<PB N="20" REF="017603_0019_0FA1DC9599BCDE00">
to the completion of the &s;cheme of GOD with reference to man|kind, or the time of GOD's being all in all.</HI> But he evidently di&s;cov|ers to us his ignorance of the matter: For the time to which this pa&s;&s;age refers, is <HI>before the opening of the &s;even &s;eals.</HI> And here <HI>&s;aints and angels, and all creatures,</HI> are repre&s;ented as making this acknowledgment, in the 13th ver&s;e of this 5th of the Revelation, in order to &s;ignify, that <HI>GOD in CHRIST JESUS is the &s;ole object of wor&s;hip and not</HI> any <HI>creature what&s;oever.</HI> The ingenius Mr <HI>Wap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e</HI> and others have ob&s;erved to this purpo&s;e; and it is worthy to be regarded. But, as CHRIST is now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his kingdom, and his power and dominion will be acknowledged by all creatures; <HI>the opening of the &s;eals of</HI> the &s;ealed book, or volume, hereupon follows: And con&s;equently this knowing and a&s;&s;uming author is egregiou&s;ly mi&s;taken, when he declares, that it looks forward to the completion of GOD's &s;cheme with reference to mankind: For it refers to the <HI>opening of the &s;eals:</HI> And by the <HI>opening of the &s;eals,</HI> it is &s;hewed, that there are no creatures but what are &s;ubject and &s;ub&s;ervient to CHRIST, the Lord and judge of this world in the conduct of his providence We &s;ee then, how little regard is to be paid to &s;uch &s;uperficial interpreters of the word of the living GOD.</P>
<P>BUT our extracter is not yet &s;atisfied: He is not contented with extracting from a number of writers <HI>the many texts they have men|tioned in favor of &s;alvation for all men;</HI> but, out of his abundant kindne&s;s <HI>he will exhibit,</HI> as he tells us, a <HI>like extract from what they and others have offered in an&s;wer to the objections brought again&s;t the truth of this,</HI> i. e. his precious <HI>doctrine.</HI></P>
<P>AND here Mr. <HI>Jo&s;eph Nicol Scot,</HI> is produced to an&s;wer the ob|jection, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>the puni&s;hment of the wicked is declared in the &s;cripture to be eter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">,</HI> &amp;c. And this &s;ame Mr. <HI>Scot,</HI> &s;ays, <HI>For my own part, I mu&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> confe&s;s, that after having with repeated care examined all the pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture that relate to the future puni&s;hment, I have not been able to find one &s;ingle text in which this article of an eternal and endle&s;s mi&s;ery is either expre&s;sly affirmed or nece&s;&s;arily implied.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is a very peremptory and bold a&s;&s;ertion; and yet it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed there is no truth in it: For after all his pretended care to examine all the pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture relating to this matter it is certain, that he has not &s;o carefully examined them as he &s;hould; or he has not taken the genuine &s;en&s;e and meaning of many of them.</P>
<P>HERE we readily grant, that the word <HI>Aione,</HI> as well as the <HI>He|brew</HI> word <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m,</HI> in the Old Te&s;tament, is frequently u&s;ed for <HI>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> age,</HI> or a li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ed time: And our tran&s;lators have again and again, and very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> mi&s;taken in giving the &s;en&s;e of this word very va|riou&s;ly and unaccountably.</P>
<P>HOWEVER this word <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> even in the <HI>&s;ingular</HI> &s;ometimes, is u&s;ed to &s;ignify <HI>an interminable duration</HI> of puni&s;hment and mi&s;ery. Thus we under&s;tand it, when it is &s;aid concerning him, that <HI>&s;peak|eth again&s;t the holy &s;pirit,</HI> as in Matt. xii. 32, <HI>It &s;hall not be forgiven
<PB N="21" REF="017603_0020_0FA1DC965CEA34D8">
him, neither in this world, nor in the world to come;</HI> or, more ex|actly according to the Gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k <HI>It &s;hall not be forgiven him either in this age or that to come.</HI> Where, by <HI>this age,</HI> we under&s;tand <HI>the age</HI> in which CHRIST lived&punc; and from <HI>that</HI> time to the end of the world; and <HI>by the age to come,</HI> we under&s;tand the lengthy age, <HI>the perpetual age,</HI> that is to &s;ucceed it: So, that <HI>this &s;in will never be forgiven.</HI> And the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> has given the rea&s;on, why &s;uch as are guilty of this &s;in will never be forgiven: For writes he, in Heb. vi 4 &amp; 6 <HI>It is impo&s;&s;ible to renew them again to repentance.</HI> And &s;urely if it is impo&s;&s;ible to recover them to repentance; it is im|po&s;&s;ible, that they &s;hould be <HI>pardoned here or hereafter:</HI> And there|fore they mu&s;t undergo an <HI>eternal puni&s;hment.</HI></P>
<P>THE Greek word <HI>Aione,</HI> we have allowed, is &s;ometimes u&s;ed for <HI>an age:</HI> But it is derived from the <HI>Greek</HI> adverb <HI>Aci,</HI> which &s;igni|fies <HI>always</HI>&mdash;And we a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> per&s;uaded, that the <HI>adjective</HI> from it, with, or without, Mr. Scot's leave, generally &s;ignifies <HI>everla&s;ting:</HI> Nor can we recollect any place, where it has a different &s;ignification.</P>
<P>WITHOUT in&s;i&s;ting here on this term, <HI>Aionios,</HI> as it is applied to the <HI>ble&s;&s;ed GOD;</HI> and, when it is &s;o, &s;urely it cannot be aright un|der&s;tood of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>limited duration:</HI> For the Divine Being is <HI>without be|ginning;</HI> and he is a <HI>never ending Being:</HI>&mdash;This term is often attri|buted to things that <HI>had a beginning, and will never know a period.</HI> Thus, the terms <HI>eternal,</HI> or <HI>everla&s;ting,</HI> as <HI>adjectives</HI> are attributed, not only to <HI>angels,</HI> to <HI>the &s;ouls of men,</HI> and to the <HI>heavens and earth</HI> with regard to their &s;ub&s;tance; but to various other things in the book of GOD.</P>
<P>IT is as certain as any thing can be, that the <HI>Greek</HI> word, which the knowing Mr <HI>Scot</HI> will not have to be &s;ignifying <HI>eternal,</HI> is u&s;ed for <HI>eternal</HI> in numerous places, as we &s;hall make plain and evident. Thus <HI>this adjective is adduced</HI> concerning the <HI>covenant of God;</HI> which is &s;aid to be <HI>everla&s;ting;</HI> becau&s;e, according to the tenor of it, <HI>God will eternally be reconciled and favourable</HI> to them, that are in it. So <HI>the go&s;pel</HI> is called the <HI>everla&s;t|ing go&s;pel;</HI> which &s;urely cannot mean of a temporary dura|tion: for, as it has had its influence and efficacy from the begin|ning of the world; its influence and efficacy will al&s;o endure thro'|out all ages &mdash;So <HI>the redemption</HI> purcha&s;ed and procured by CHRIST JESUS is expre&s;ly called <HI>eternal redemption;</HI> fora&s;much as the pow|er and efficacy of this redemption will <HI>la&s;t forever.&mdash;So the con&s;ola|tion,</HI> that is conveyed by the go&s;pel and grace of our divine redeemer to renewed and gracious &s;ouls, is &s;aid to be <HI>everla&s;ting:</HI> Why? They who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this <HI>everla&s;ting con&s;olation,</HI> will not enjoy it, merely for a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ea&s;on; but they will never be deprived of it. So we read of enjoying in the heavenly world <HI>life eternal;</HI> and that the holy and gracious will have <HI>eternal &s;alvation, eternal glory,</HI> and <HI>the things invi&s;ible and eternal,</HI> in the <HI>everla&s;ting kingdom</HI> of God our Saviour. And what can this &s;ame adjective here over and over again
<PB N="22" REF="017603_0021_0FA1DC971A3EFE80">
u&s;ed, mean? Certainly it cannot mean any thing &s;hort of a perpe|tual duration in any one of the&s;e places: And the term is adapted to convey that idea. And &s;o we read of the <HI>eternal judgment</HI> in Heb. vi 2 <HI>Aioniou Krimatos.</HI> And why <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s it &s;o called? From its effects and con&s;equences: for it will bring <HI>life eternal</HI> to the good and gracious; and <HI>eternal wretchedne&s;s and mi&s;ery</HI> to the wicked, unrighteous and uncharitable.</P>
<P>BUT here is the in&s;urmountable difficulty: Mr. <HI>Nicol S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t</HI> can find <HI>not &s;o much as one &s;ingle text in which this article of eterna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> mi|&s;ery is either expre&s;ly affirmed or nece&s;&s;arily imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ied.</HI> What a &s;trange thing is this, that he could not find Matt xxv 46! <HI>The&s;e,</HI> i. e the wicked and ungracious, <HI>&s;hall go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment, but the righteous into life eternal.</HI> Every one that has eyes to &s;ee, may &s;ee that <HI>the &s;ame epithet</HI> is u&s;ed for the puni&s;hment of the wick|ed, as for the life of the righteous: And why then mu&s;t a two fold meaning be given to it?

<P>BUT &s;ome will in&s;i&s;t on it, that it is very hard for the wicked to have <HI>their bodies and &s;ouls forever tormented in hell fire.</HI> Now we cannot pretend to &s;ay, in what way and to what a degree the cor|poreal part of the impenitent may be puni&s;hed. However, it is high|ly rea&s;onable, that the impenitent tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, who &s;inned in and with <HI>the body,</HI> &s;hould al&s;o <HI>&s;uffer in it.</HI> And therefore the <HI>re&s;urrecti|on of the dead</HI> is certified and a&s;&s;ured to us. And it would be ad|vi&s;eable for all, who are wicked and vicious, when they are indulg|ing to their lu&s;ts and vices, to think of that &s;ore puni&s;hment, which is hereafter to be inflicted on <HI>their bodies,</HI> as well as their &s;ouls and &s;pirits, for what they are doing.</P>
<P>AND yet it &s;hould be remembered, that <HI>the fire,</HI> in which impeni|tent &s;inners are to be tormented, cannot be a gro&s;s <HI>culinary fire:</HI> For it is &s;aid to be <HI>the fire prepared for the devil and his angels.</HI> And it may be &s;uppo&s;ed, that <HI>the principal puni&s;hment</HI> of &s;inning men may be intellectual and &s;piritual, and beyond the <HI>reach of any corporeal &s;en&s;e.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rhimund<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> de Sabunde.

eminence, perfection and glory of the Divine Being, again&s;t whom they are committed: For the faults and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions are height|ened and greatened from the great and glorious qualities of that Be|ing, again&s;t whom they are committed. It mu&s;t therefore be deem|ed no &s;mall matter, but a <HI>great wickedne&s;s, to &s;in again&s;t GOD,</HI> even in the lea&s;t re&s;pects and in&s;tances: And how much greater is the crime <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f &s;inning knowingly, wilfully, pre&s;umptuou&s;ly and impeni|tently again&s;t him? Surely then <HI>this</HI> mu&s;t de&s;erve a puni&s;hment pro|portioned to its aggravated nature and malignity.</P>
<P>IT is the <HI>will and choice</HI> of rational beings, who offend, which is the grand principle in action: And <HI>this</HI> in right con&s;truction may be allowed to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s for <HI>the deed.</HI> And as bad per&s;ons quit the world with a <HI>confirmed choice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;inning,</HI> and a <HI>re&s;olution for continuing in it;</HI> they mu&s;t &s;urely de&s;erve to be continued and confirmed in their exqui&s;ite puni&s;hment for it.</P>
<P>WICKED and vicious per&s;ons are &s;o addicted to their wickedne&s;s and their vices, and &s;o powerful and predominent are their lu&s;ts, that <HI>the threatening of the mo&s;t extreme torments</HI> will not deter them from gratifying and pur&s;uing their lu&s;ts and vices: And when <HI>eternity</HI> is added to the <HI>extremity</HI> of the puni&s;hment threatened; even <HI>this</HI> is not &s;ufficient to affright and reclaim them from their evil choices and pur&s;uits. And, if &s;uch a threatening will not an&s;wer this end, much le&s;s will the <HI>threatening of &s;horter puni&s;hments,</HI> however great, avail for this purpo&s;e. They are therefore no friends to mankind, who attempt to make them believe again&s;t the apparent di&s;coveries of divine revelation, that after &s;uffering con&s;iderably and unutter|ably for a &s;ea&s;on, they &s;hall be brought, and even by means of their &s;uffering, to perfect and endle&s;s happine&s;s.</P>
<P>THERE are, however, &s;ome men, who go beyond them, that think the Almighty <HI>to be &s;uch an one as them&s;elves;</HI> and who, by their manner of &s;peaking and writing, would make us believe, that they are <HI>more gracious and merciful than GOD him&s;elf:</HI> And becau&s;e they cannot find in their own hearts, that they or others &s;hould be <HI>condemned to everla&s;ting puni&s;hments</HI> for their tran&s;ient faults and follies; therefore they are not willing that GOD &s;hould be incli|ned and re&s;olved to condemn them to &s;uch puni&s;hments, notwith|&s;tanding his peremptory declarations and threatenings.</P>
<P>BUT it is very weak and wrong to judge and conclude from the Divine benignity and infinite goodne&s;s, either that there is <HI>no place of torments and mi&s;eries re&s;erved</HI> for the puni&s;hment of wicked and impenitent mortals; or that <HI>the puni&s;hments and torments</HI> of that place, however great, <HI>are of a &s;hort duration:</HI> For the arguing in this manner is founded on error and fal&s;hood: I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> has this import and carries this &s;ignification in it, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> GOD be <HI>e&s;&s;entially and in|finitely good,</HI> he cannot be <HI>holy and righteous and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ithful;</HI> which can by no means be admitted by any &s;erious and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> per|&s;ons.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="017603_0029_0FA1DCA26EF73D38">AND what rea&s;on have any to think, that if &s;inners were allowed a longer time and continued advantages for growing penitent and reformed, it would an&s;wer a happy end and reclaim the children of di&s;obedience and impenitence? That <HI>&s;pace for repentance</HI> and tho&s;e continued advantages for turning and living to GOD if granted to &s;tupid and hardened tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, would only embolden them to be more pre&s;umptuous, ob&s;tinate and vile &s;till, and render them more hardened in their wicked and vicious choices and ways: For &s;o it is found in fact often.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>how long &s;hall GOD wait</HI> upon impenitent and hardened &s;in|ners? And who &s;hall &s;et bounds and limits to the exerci&s;e of his goodne&s;s? If guilty wretches, if hardened criminals, could have their own will and way, the gracious GOD might <HI>wait forever</HI> for their penitence and amendment. But if pre&s;umptuous mortals will think, that GOD has never &s;ufficiently tried and proved them&s;elves and others; they &s;hould be informed, that <HI>his thoughts and ways are not as their's</HI> but infinitely above them: And that glorious GOD, who is <HI>a GOD by judgment, by whom actions are weighed,</HI> certainly knows be&s;t, and indeed he only knows, when he has &s;ufficiently tried and puni&s;hed them.</P>
<P>AND ought not all the human race to acquie&s;ce in the rectitude and ju&s;tice of the Divine appointments and the executions of them?

<P>SOME have pre&s;umed to &s;peak of it as cruel to inflict long conti|nued torments on criminals, however de&s;erving of them. But <HI>at great &s;uffering</HI> and much affliction is in the nature of things con|nected with <HI>puni&s;hment;</HI> &s;o indeed there cannot be puni&s;hment without it: And it is the de&s;ign and end of anger and wrath to inflict it: We read therefore, that <HI>GOD di&s;tributes,</HI> that is in a proportional way, <HI>&s;orrows in his anger.</HI> Now, as the writer <HI>of &s;orrowful things</HI> mournfully &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gs, <HI>the anger of</HI> Cae&s;ar <HI>draws all evil along with it,</HI> mu&s;t not <HI>the anger of the immortal King bring all manner of evil, and in the highe&s;t degree with it?</HI> And as GOD in a peculiar manner claims <HI>vengeance to him&s;elf;</HI> for he &s;ays, <HI>it is mine, and I will repay it:</HI> What then can be plainer, than that <HI>it is GOD, who taketh vengeance,</HI> and that <HI>he will &s;urely and greatly do it:</HI> And <HI>let GOD be true,</HI> though <HI>all men &s;hould be found liars.</HI></P>

<P>BUT if a truth be cleared and &s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;hed there is no need of indulging to imaginations, or laying any &s;tre&s;s on &s;pecula|tions, for the &s;upport of it.</P>
<P>WE have &s;een, that the puni&s;hment threatened <HI>again&s;t impeni|tence in &s;in and wickedne&s;s, is eternal:</HI> It is <HI>that fire that is eternal,</HI> &s;uch as is prepared for the devil and his angels: <HI>Aeternus, nulli&s;que domabilis undis:</HI> It is <HI>an unquenchable fire.</HI> And nothing but what is idle and frivolous has been offered again&s;t the <HI>infliction of the threatened puni&s;hment.</HI></P>
