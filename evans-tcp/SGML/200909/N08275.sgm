<P>_I OFFER no other apology for the appearance of this plain unadorned Di&s;cour&s;e from the Pre&s;s, than, that it is in Compliance with the de&s;ire of a number of friends, who were plea&s;ed to &s;olicite a copy, in order to its publication. As I had no thoughts of any &s;uch thing as the printing of the Sermon, when I prepared it for the Pulpit, I took very imperfect notes of only the doctrinal part; it cannot therefore be expected, that it now appears verbatim, as it was delivered. However, the thoughts are &s;ub&s;tantially the &s;ame, though, perhaps, &s;ometimes a little tran&s;|po&s;ed, and in &s;ome parts a little enlargement of argument. Such thoughts as &s;eemed to be properly new, i. e. did not occur in the delive|ry, I have chiefly thrown into marginal notes.&mdash; The reader will, indeed, find in this di&s;cour&s;e, neither novelty of thought to gratify his curio|&s;ity, nor elegance of compo&s;ition, to rai&s;e in him a kind of &s;uperficial plea&s;ure.

<P>_IT is no uncommon thing for the men of this world to look upon the people of GOD as be&s;ide them&s;elves. They account their fervency and &s;pirituality in Religion enthu&s;ia&s;m. This impu|tation the Apo&s;tle obviates in the 13th ver&s;e of our Context; and vindicates him&s;elf and brethren by con&s;idering the greatne&s;s of the object, and impor|tance of the matter of their exerci&s;e. If you reckon us be&s;ides our&s;elves, it is, (as tho' the Apo&s;tle had &s;aid) to GOD, who is worthy of the warme&s;t devo|tion; though, &s;ometimes, for your &s;akes we &s;up|pre&s;s the emotion of our affections, that we may addre&s;s you with &s;ober &s;olemn arguments.&mdash;It is impo&s;&s;ible to have any proper &s;en&s;e of the love of CHRIST, expre&s;&s;ed by his dying for us, and not feel a mighty energy from it upon the heart. He died in order to deliver &s;uch as were in a legal and &s;piri|tual &s;en&s;e dead, from their wretched and woful
<PB N="6" REF="010562_0005_0F80BC255911FFD0">
condition, and re&s;tore them to life.&mdash;A life devoted to his honour and &s;ervice.&mdash;He died for all, that they which live, &s;hould not henceforth live to them&s;elves, but to him who died for them, and ro&s;e again.</P>
<P>HENCE they are rai&s;ed above the government of carnal principles, nor do they live according to the cour&s;e of this world: they know no man after the fle&s;h, &s;o as to accommodate them&s;elves to his carnal reli&s;h and principles. True Chri&s;tians live under the impre&s;&s;ion of divine and &s;piritual truths, and tho' they know not CHRIST, nor conver&s;e with him in that manner in which the Di&s;ciples did in the days of his fle&s;h here below, yet they have a &s;piri|tual acquaintance and intercour&s;e with him. Their life mu&s;t, therefore, be &s;uch as the maxims and principles are, upon which it is formed; and con|&s;equently, very different from that cour&s;e, in which the men of this world live. The illative par|ticle <HI>therefore,</HI> &s;hews that the words of my text are a native inference from the forementioned con&s;iderations. The words are an hypothetical pro|po&s;ition, in the antecedent of which, we have the &s;tate and condition of true Chri&s;tians expre&s;&s;ed. They are in CHRIST. That is, they are united to him by faith, have an intere&s;t in his per&s;on, righteou&s;|ne&s;s, and all the benefits of his purcha&s;e, and have his Spirit dwelling in them.&mdash;The con&s;equent gives us their character. They are new creatures. If any man be in CHRIST, he is a new creature. The word might be rendered a new creation. It &s;ignifies that ble&s;&s;ed change wrought in the hearts of &s;inners by the Holy Spirit, whereby they become dead to &s;in, and alive to GOD thro' CHRIST JESUS. Thus the
<PB N="7" REF="010562_0006_0F80BC26344BC1A0">
Apo&s;tle adds by way of explication, old things are pa&s;&s;ed away, behold all things are become new.&mdash; What I intend from this pa&s;&s;age, at pre&s;ent, is, <LIST>
<ITEM>I. To explain the nature of this change, here called the new creature, or new creation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. To &s;hew that this is the certain character of all tho&s;e, who are in CHRIST JESUS.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I RETURN to the fir&s;t propo&s;ed, viz. To explain the nature of this change here, called the new creature.</P>
<P>IT con&s;i&s;ts in a new temper and di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;oul towards GOD and divine things, formed by the Holy Spirit's infu&s;ing a principle of &s;piritual life, whereby the heart of a &s;inner is turned from the love and &s;ervice of &s;in to GOD and holine&s;s; the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of which, is an happy change in the prevailing cour&s;e of his practice.</P>
<P>IN this de&s;cription, you may ob&s;erve, 1&s;t. that the author of this change, or the agent by whom it is effected, is the Holy Spirit. It is expre&s;sly a&s;cribed to him by the Apo&s;tle, Tit. iii. 5. Not by works of righteou&s;ne&s;s which we have done, but according to his mercy he &s;aved us, by wa&s;hing of regeneration, and <HI>renewing of the Holy Ghost.</HI> A &s;e|rious and attentive con&s;ideration of the &s;cripture-account of man's fallen &s;tate, will plainly &s;hew, that none, le&s;s than &s;uch a divine Almighty Agent, can bring a creature, &s;o entirely revolted from GOD, to a right temper towards him.&mdash;He is dead in tre&s;s|pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, Ephe&s;. ii. 1. his carnal mind is en|mity again&s;t GOD, for it is not &s;ubject to the law of
<PB N="8" REF="010562_0007_0F80BC26C05649D8">
GOD, neither indeed can be. Rom. viii. 7. From the&s;e repre&s;entations it appears, that there is not any power or principle in a &s;inner, while in his na|tural &s;tate, in the lea&s;t degree, tending to a return to GOD. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Where there is no love to GOD, there is, certainly, no prin|ciple of life, no tendency to choo&s;e and cleave to GOD. For love is the fulfilling of the law. Upon the love of GOD and our neigh|bour, hang all the Law and the Prophets. Mat. xxii. 40. Now where enmity again&s;t GOD reigns, there love to him is altogether wanting.&mdash;To &s;uppo&s;e, therefore, an unregenerate per&s;on may love GOD and holine&s;s, would be, to &s;uppo&s;e him po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a principle of &s;piritual life, and that love and enmity are not contra|dictory, but quite con&s;i&s;tent, which is ab&s;urd.</NOTE> But on the contrary, principles of &s;tronge&s;t oppo&s;ition to any &s;uch change govern him. He is under the power of &s;in and in love with it. His reli&s;hes and inclinations are all earthly and car|nal; and enmity denotes the mo&s;t fixed unyeilding oppo&s;ition of the will to GOD; the greate&s;t di&s;gu&s;t and aver&s;ion. This temper, therefore, mu&s;t be broken and removed, before the &s;oul can &s;ubmit to the divine government. The metaphors made u&s;e of, in the &s;acred Scripture, to repre&s;ent this change, give us the &s;ame idea of the matter, viz. a re&s;ur|rection, or pa&s;&s;ing from death to life. Eph. v. 14. John v. 24. a new birth; John iii. 3. and a new creation, as in the text, and Eph ii. 10. all which, denote the utter ab&s;ence of any principle or power, whereby the &s;inner can di&s;po&s;e, or determine his own heart to turn to GOD. Nor can any meer moral &s;ua&s;ion prevail with him.</P>
<P N="2">2d. The effect produced, by the agency of the holy Spirit, is a principle of &s;piritual life. You hath he quickened (&s;ays the Apo&s;tle) who were dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins. Eph. ii. 1. The implan|tation of this divine principle, in which the &s;oul is
<PB N="9" REF="010562_0008_0F80BC27BA9AEA18">
pa&s;&s;ive, is what is &s;trictly called <HI>Regeneration;</HI> and the exerci&s;e thereof, in &s;inners actually turning from the power of &s;in to GOD, is what divines mean by <HI>Conver&s;ion.</HI>&mdash;This principle of life, perhaps, con|&s;i&s;ts in &s;piritual knowledge of GOD and divine things, whereby their nature and excellency are truly apprehended, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, as they are.&mdash; Such knowledge as gives a proper impre&s;&s;ion and reli&s;h of things to the heart. The nature of true grace &s;eems to be thus expre&s;&s;ed, Jer. xxxi. 34.&mdash; They &s;hall all <HI>know me,</HI> from the lea&s;t to the great|e&s;t. <HI>vide</HI> 1 John ii. 20.&mdash;27. The &s;pread of true Religion in the world, is &s;ignified by the prevalence of knowledge; the earth &s;hall be full of the know|ledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the &s;ea. I&s;a. xi. 9. And the encrea&s;e of true Religion is ex|pre&s;&s;ed, by the metaphor of encrea&s;ing light. More|over, the light of the moon &s;hall be as the light of the &s;un, and the light of the &s;un &s;hall be &s;evenfold, as the light of &s;even days, in the day that the LORD bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the &s;troke of their wound. I&s;a. xxx. 26.</P>
<P>THE reality, and true nature of this divine prin|ciple of life, can only be known to us by its effects. The&s;e are briefly pointed out in the latter part of my text; old things are pa&s;&s;ed away, behold all things are become new.&mdash;The&s;e words are not to be taken in an ab&s;olute &s;en&s;e, as though the work of grace was compleat and perfect in degree and no remainders of corruption were left in that heart, in which this ble&s;&s;ed change is wrought. This would be contrary to both &s;cripture and experience. The &s;aints, in &s;cripture, bitterly complain of indwelling corruption. Says holy David. Who can under|&s;tand
<PB N="10" REF="010562_0009_0F80BC285B604D00">
his errors? P&s;alm xix. 12. He laments, that his iniquities were gone over his head, as an heavy burden, they were too heavy for him. He acknow|ledges his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and his &s;in was ever before him. P&s;a. xxxviii. 4. and li. 3. The Apo&s;tle bewails his carnality; that he did what he allowed not, what he hated; that when he would do good, evil was pre&s;ent with him; that indwelling &s;in, as a law in his members, warred again&s;t the law of his mind; and cries out, O wretched man that I am, who &s;hall deliver me from the body of this death? Rom. vii. 14. and <HI>&s;eq.</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">To &s;uppo&s;e, as &s;ome do, that the Apo&s;tle here &s;peaks of his unconverted &s;tate, is very ab&s;urd. For that is to &s;uppo&s;e an un|regenerate per&s;on to delight in the law of GOD after the inward man; to have a law in his mind different from, and oppo&s;ite to the law of &s;in in his members, &s;o that he can truly &s;ay, it is no more I that do it, but &s;in that dwelleth in me; to long for deliverance from &s;in, and rejoice in the pro&s;pect of it through CHRIST JESUS his Lord; and, with his mind, he &s;erves the law of GOD. And that is to &s;uppo&s;e the mo&s;t flat contradictions. Such a &s;uppo&s;ition de&s;troys all di&s;tinctions between a regenerate and an unregenerate &s;tate.</NOTE>&mdash;If in regeneration, no indwel|ling &s;in, no remainders of corruption were left in the heart, then the true Chri&s;tian would love GOD with the utmo&s;t inten&s;ene&s;s his nature would be ca|pable of, and that, without the lea&s;t abatement or intermi&s;&s;ion, any moment of his life. For coldne&s;s of love to GOD, or not to love him to the highe&s;t degree we are, in the nature of things, capable of, is corruption; and &s;ome &s;inful di&s;temper in the heart, mu&s;t be the rea&s;on why we love him no bet|ter. Now, how arrogant would that man be, who would &s;ay, that he loved GOD in &s;o high a degree, and with &s;o much inten&s;ene&s;s, that he could not wi&s;h to love him better, or more con&s;tantly than he does! would any one look upon &s;uch a per&s;on to be a true Chri&s;tian, or, to know any thing about true love to GOD at all?</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="010562_0010_0F80BC290908CE20">UPON this &s;uppo&s;ition too, there would, at no time, be any motion of &s;in in the heart of a Chri&s;|tian; nor any the lea&s;t tendency to evil. Con&s;e|quently, he would be perfect as &s;oon as regenerated, and could never commit any &s;in in his practice.&mdash; It will not avail any thing here, to &s;ay that a Chri&s;|tian may be drawn into &s;in by external temptation, as Adam was, when he eat the forbidden fruit. For external temptation can never entangle a per&s;on in &s;in, but by fir&s;t defiling the heart. While that is untainted, he is proof again&s;t temptation. Thus, it fir&s;t gained Adam's heart, and then he committed the outward tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and &s;o apo&s;tatized from GOD.&mdash;In like manner, according to this notion, when a Chri&s;tian is by temptation drawn into &s;in, his heart is defiled, and then he has corruption dwelling in him. Con&s;equently, he apo&s;tatizes from his regenerate &s;tate, and relap&s;es into his former natural condition, which is ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>IT is plain, therefore, that the language of my text is not to be taken in an ab&s;olute, but a quali|fied &s;en&s;e. Yet, it certainly denotes a very great change in the whole man. The whole temper of the heart, and &s;tate of things are quite altered, &s;o that the man is not in a moral &s;en&s;e the &s;ame &s;ort of a creature that he was. He is, indeed, phy&s;ically the &s;ame, yet morally a new creature. In whom there is a perfection of parts, though not of degrees. <HI>i. e.</HI> The whole man is renewed, though he be but in part renewed. This matter, I would endeavour more fully to illu&s;trate in the few following particu|lars.&mdash;This happy change,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. SUPPOSES the removal of the &s;inner's old &s;e|curity.
<PB N="12" REF="010562_0011_0F80BC29EF826638">
His natural &s;tate is repre&s;ented, in the word of GOD, by the metaphors of &s;leep and death, which denote great in&s;en&s;ibility. He is the va&s;&s;al of &s;atan; who works in the children of di&s;obedience. Eph. ii. 2. And while &s;atan, as a &s;trong man armed, keeps the hou&s;e, his goods are in peace.&mdash;The &s;inner's heart is compared to fallow ground, which lies &s;till, &s;pontaneou&s;ly yeilding weeds and thorns, and not broke up, to prepare it for &s;eed, in order to a crop. The fir&s;t work of the Holy Spirit, in order to bring about this change, is to arou&s;e the &s;inner out of this deep &s;ecurity. This he does, by the application of the divine law to the con&s;cience. Perhaps, the threatening of the law for &s;ome particular tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ion, fir&s;t alarms the &s;inner, and brings him to &s;eri|ous con&s;ideration. Brings him to think what he has been doing all his life. Upon this he finds he has been living in carele&s;s neglect of GOD, and his own eternal intere&s;t. He begins to &s;ee this cour&s;e will never do, there is a nece&s;&s;ity of turning to GOD. But alas! he finds an indi&s;po&s;ed di&s;inclined heart. The Holy Spirit opens, by light let into the under|&s;tanding, the &s;pirituality and &s;trictne&s;s of the law, and thereby di&s;covers the exceeding corruption and wickedne&s;s of the heart. When the commandment comes with power, corruption is irritated, and ri&s;es up in oppo&s;ition. Sin, taking occa&s;ion by the com|mandment, works in him all manner of concupi&s;|cence.&mdash;His &s;ins revive, and he dies. Rom. vii. 8, 9. Hence, the con&s;cience is impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of divine wrath. The poor &s;inner becomes deeply &s;en|&s;ible of his mi&s;ery, and exceeding anxious about a way of e&s;cape. All his attempts to relieve him&s;elf, and mend his own heart, only di&s;cover more and more, his exceeding &s;infulne&s;s and wretchedne&s;s.
<PB N="13" REF="010562_0012_0F80BC2A847D3F08">
He now &s;ees his ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of mercy, and the grace of GOD to change his heart; without which, he mu&s;t be undone forever. This conviction of &s;in and mi&s;ery is not, indeed, an ingredient in the change it&s;elf, of which my text &s;peaks, but only di&s;covers the nece&s;&s;ity of it, and awakens the &s;inner to &s;eek after it. Many are deeply convinced, who never become new creatures. But, &s;uch as the Holy Spirit has never awakened out of a deep &s;leep of carnal &s;ecurity, have, certainly, never been the &s;ubjects of his gracious operations. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. WHEN the &s;aving change takes place, the old darkne&s;s and blindne&s;s of the mind pa&s;&s;es away, and the under&s;tanding is divinely enlightened. He, who was &s;ometimes darkne&s;s, is made light in the LORD. Eph. v. 8. The &s;inner is, in his natural &s;tate, ali|enated from the life of GOD through the ignorance that is in him, becau&s;e of the blindne&s;s of his heart. Eph. iv. 18. The mind is, by nature, &s;o greatly e&s;tranged from GOD and divine things, that it is called darkne&s;s in the ab&s;tract. But the Spirit of GOD di&s;pels this darkne&s;s, and enlightens the mind in the knowledge of CHRIST, and the &s;cheme of &s;alvation through him, as revealed in the go&s;pel. GOD who commanded the light, in creating the natural world, to &s;hine out of darkne&s;s, &s;hines in the heart; to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of GOD, in the face of JESUS CHRIST. 11 Cor. iv. 6. JEHOVAH appears tran&s;cendently ex|cellent. The law of GOD appears then to be, indeed, &s;piritual, and holy, and ju&s;t, and good. The mind beholds the beauty and excellency of &s;piritual things; and of that internal purity and holine&s;s, which the law of GOD requires. Now, the abomi|nable
<PB N="14" REF="010562_0013_0F80BC2B43CAA848">
vilene&s;s of &s;in is clearly apprehended. In a word, all things appear in a new and very different point of light. The under&s;tanding beholds them in their true nature. Hence,</P>
<P N="3">3. THE per&s;on's old e&s;timate of things pa&s;&s;es away. By nature, he was filled with a high e&s;teem of the world, &s;in, and &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures. This world, in one point of view or another, he accounted his chief good. He accounted it plea&s;ure, to riot in the day time. 11 Pet. ii. 13. He thought the &s;ervice of &s;in plea&s;ant, and judged it liberty, to make pro|vi&s;ion for the fle&s;h, to fulfil the lu&s;ts thereof.&mdash;He accounted the &s;ervice of GOD a grieveous burden, and the law of GOD, e&s;pecially as it re&s;pected the inward man, a di&s;agreeable re&s;traint. He exceed|ingly di&s;reli&s;hed the &s;overeignty, and freene&s;s of the grace of GOD.&mdash;He could not think of renouncing all his own righteou&s;ne&s;s as filthy rags, and coming poor, and mi&s;erable, and blind, and naked to the righteou&s;ne&s;s of CHRIST, as his only refuge.&mdash;But now, how changed his judgement of matters! He accounts all things but lo&s;s, for the excellency of the knowledge of JESUS CHRIST his Lord, for whom he &s;uffers the lo&s;s of all things, and counts them but dung, that he may win CHRIST. Phil. iii. 8. JESUS CHRIST is altogether lovely and precious; and he highly prizes, and greatly admires the grace of GOD. He e&s;teems the favour and friend|&s;hip of GOD his life. He exceedingly values the di|vine law, and &s;ees the beauty of holine&s;s.&mdash;He apprehends the emptine&s;s, and vanity of this world. He looks upon &s;in as very vile and abomi|nable, and groans under it, as a heavy load.&mdash;In con&s;equence of all this,</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="15" REF="010562_0014_0F80BC2C050172C8">4. THE choice and inclination of the will is quite changed. In the &s;inner's natural &s;tate, his will freely choo&s;es, fully con&s;ents to &s;in.&mdash;It is in &s;uch a &s;tate of fixed oppo&s;ition to GOD, that it is enmity again&s;t him; for it is not &s;ubject to the law of GOD, neither, indeed, can be. Rom. viii. 7. It does not &s;ubmit to the righteou&s;ne&s;s of CHRIST, or the &s;cheme of &s;alvation exhibited in the go&s;pel.&mdash; But upon &s;uch a new view of things as has been &s;ugge&s;ted, this enmity and oppo&s;ition is &s;ubdued. A rational creature cannot chu&s;e evil as evil, and therefore, the will mu&s;t needs follow this practical judgement of the under&s;tanding.&mdash;It chearfully choo&s;es the righteou&s;ne&s;s of CHRIST, and &s;ubmits to the terms of reconciliation with GOD, which the go&s;pel propo&s;es. It &s;weetly re&s;ts in GOD as a chief good, &s;ubmits to him as a mo&s;t rightful Sovereign, and e&s;teems it as a great priviledge to be under his government.

<P N="5">5. THE affections take a new cour&s;e. Their old current was earthly and carnal. They were impetu|ous and overbearing in their tendency towards for|bidden objects, or inordinate towards &s;uch as are, in them&s;elves, lawful. They had the government, and led the poor &s;oul captive: they blinded the un|der&s;tanding, perverted the judgement, &s;tupified the con&s;cience, and entangled the will; and thus, things were in di&s;order and confu&s;ion.&mdash;But now, divine light having repre&s;ented things in their true nature and importance to the under&s;tanding, rectified the
<PB N="16" REF="010562_0015_0F80BC2CD6AC9890">
judgement, and gained the will; the affections na|turally follow and become &s;ubject. In re&s;pect of their objects and exerci&s;e, they are, indeed, new. They terminate on &s;piritual objects, and &s;o become &s;piritual. Now love, de&s;ire, delight, joy, zeal, hope, embrace GOD and &s;piritual communications from him, which the heart before di&s;reli&s;hed; and evan|gelical &s;orrow and hatred have &s;in (in which the &s;oul was wont to delight) for their object.</P>
<P>AS this alteration does not re&s;pect the pa&s;&s;ions or affections only, but takes place, primarily, in the under&s;tanding, judgement and will, it will, there|fore, not be a tran&s;ient fla&s;h, or &s;hort lived zeal, like the &s;tony ground hearers; but is habitual and fixed. The graces of the Holy Spirit are not always in exerci&s;e, but there is always &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of things as makes the &s;oul re&s;tle&s;s and unea&s;y in &s;uch a ca&s;e. There is always a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;eek the lively exer|ci&s;e of grace, a tendency towards it. This &s;hews, that a principle of life abides in the &s;oul; which, from time to time, is drawn forth into &s;ome &s;en&s;ible exerci&s;e. From &s;uch a change in the &s;oul's temper and &s;en&s;e of things, it follows,</P>
<P N="6">6. THAT the old cour&s;e of practice is changed. Old cour&s;es of &s;in are for&s;aken and abandoned. The duties of religion, formerly neglected, are now performed with con&s;cientious &s;trictne&s;s. The &s;ubject of this happy change, immediately, withdraws from the company of the loo&s;e and ungodly; and choo&s;es the &s;ociety of God's people. But it is not only in the openly vicious and irreligious, that a change of conduct appears. Such as have &s;upported an exter|nally regular and religious character, upon this new
<PB N="17" REF="010562_0016_0F80BC2D78EF1A90">
view and &s;en&s;e of things, behave in a very different manner. By the influences of the Holy Spirit, they are, frequently, enabled to perform holy du|ties with much &s;olemnity and &s;piritual life: nor can they re&s;t ea&s;y with a cold formality in the &s;ervice of GOD. They &s;eek communion with him. They hear the word of GOD with another kind of attention. They often hang upon the lips of the preacher.&mdash; Their conver&s;ation often &s;avours of Heaven, and things divine. They cannot make light of &s;in, and indulge indwelling corruption as heretofore. They are jealous of their own hearts, and watch again&s;t the motions of &s;in there. They mourn over, and maintain a prevailing oppo&s;ition to it. They that are CHRIST'S have crucified the fle&s;h, with its af|fections and lu&s;ts. Gal. v. 24. Through the Spirit they mortify the deeds of the body, and &s;o live. Rom. vii. 13. Hence their conflict and &s;piritual warfare: for the fle&s;h lu&s;teth again&s;t the &s;pirit, and the &s;pirit again&s;t the fle&s;h, and the&s;e are contrary the one to the other. Gal. v. 17.</P>

John viii. 36. This de&s;ign, therefore, he carries into execu|tion, by the agency of the Holy Spirit. He &s;aves, not only from the guilt, but al&s;o from the power of &s;in. He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> called JESUS, for he &s;hall &s;ave his people from their &s;ins. Mat. i. 21.&mdash;For this purpo&s;e was the SON of GOD manife&s;ted, that he might de&s;troy the works of the devil. 1 John iii. 8. In accom|pli&s;hing this purpo&s;e, they who are his, are born of GOD, and do not commit &s;in, for his &s;eed remaineth in them, and they cannot &s;in, for they are born of GOD. ver. 9. <HI>i e.</HI> they do not commit &s;in, they can|not &s;in habitually, with free con&s;ent, and delight: and &s;o, do not continue in the practice of any known &s;in. In any other &s;en&s;e, the Apo&s;tle would contradict him&s;elf. For he tells us, if we &s;ay we have no &s;in, we deceive our&s;elves, and the truth is not in us. 1 John i. 8. And in this &s;en&s;e, his ob&s;er|vation is &s;ufficient to &s;hew, that &s;uch are new creatures.</P>
<P N="2">2. THEY who are in CHRIST, have his Spirit dwelling in them. If any man have not the Spirit of CHRIST, he is none of his. Rom. viii. 9.&mdash; Now the indwelling of the Spirit mu&s;t denote his pre|&s;ence, grace, and influence in the heart, as a &s;anc|tifier. He is a holy Spirit, and cannot endure the power and dominion of &s;in where he dwells. They who are joined to the LORD are one &s;pirit. 1 Cor. vi. 17.

<P><PB N="19" REF="010562_0018_0F80BC2F01F2A070">IT remains now to make &s;ome Reflections upon this &s;ubject by way of Improvement.</P>
<P><HI>Reflection</HI> I. WHAT has been &s;aid &s;erves to cor|rect a fatal mi&s;take of tho&s;e who imagine, they do not &s;tand in need of &s;uch a change as has been de|&s;cribed, becau&s;e they have been born in the vi&s;ible church; have been early devoted to GOD in bap|ti&s;m; have had a religious education; and e&s;pe|cially when their lives are externally religious and regular. They acknowledge, that heathens and in|fidels, or the gro&s;sly wicked and profligate mu&s;t be regenerated, and become new creatures. But as for them, they have been brought up in a religious manner, and therefore, it cannot be nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould experience &s;o great and remarkable a change. Thus Paul once thought, he was circumci&s;ed the eighth day, of the &s;tock of I&s;rael, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews, as touching the law, a Phari&s;ee (the &s;tricte&s;t &s;ect among the Jews) concerning zeal, per&s;ecuting the Church; touching the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the law blamele&s;s. The&s;e things he counted his gain. Phil. iii. 5, 6, 7. He imagined, he was in a fair way to heaven. He was alive in his own apprehen&s;ion, until the commandment came, and then &s;in revived, and he died. Rom. vii. 8, 9.&mdash;But alas! all mankind are born the &s;ubjects of &s;piritual death, and de&s;ti|tute of principles of &s;piritual life and holine&s;s. By our fir&s;t apo&s;tacy from GOD, we have all lo&s;t his moral image, and have a carnal mind, which is en|mity again&s;t GOD. Hence how orthodox &s;oever our profe&s;&s;ion may be, and how &s;trict &s;oever our practice, yet all will be dead and &s;piritle&s;s, while that inward &s;tate of the mind continues. All our

religious &s;ervices will be but dead works, and can|not be acceptable in the &s;ight of GOD. There will be no &s;en&s;e or reli&s;h of the beauty and excellency of GOD, and divine things. And &s;uch a life, cannot be &s;aid to be truly holy. The heart is &s;uch as its governing principles are. It is, therefore, indi&s;|pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary, that the &s;oul be delivered from the governing power of carnal principles, and re|&s;tored to life, in order to &s;erve GOD in a &s;piritual manner. But &s;uch a change of governing principles, will infer a very great alteration in the &s;tate and temper of the heart; as great, as the difference between life and death. Such a per&s;on will, con|&s;equently, feel a very different frame of mind, and &s;en&s;e of things; and be engaged in the ways of re|ligion, in a very different manner: and with a very different zeal and integrity of heart. He is not the &s;ame &s;ort of per&s;on as he was, he becomes indeed a new creature. He &s;erves GOD upon principles truly &s;piritual, and his practice of religious duties partakes of the &s;pirituality of the&s;e principles.

<P><HI>Reflection</HI> II. SEEING all mankind are, by nature, in &s;uch a &s;tate, as that they mu&s;t become new crea|tures, and experience &s;o great a change as I have repre&s;ented, in order to their becoming capable of truly &s;erving GOD, and happine&s;s in the enjoyment of him; it is of the la&s;t importance, my hearers, that you examine whether you are the &s;ubjects of &s;uch a change. Recollect the particulars included in it, which I have mentioned in this di&s;cour&s;e, compare your&s;elves with them, and &s;ee whether they are de&s;criptive of your ca&s;e. As to &s;uch of you as are &s;trangers to any thing like &s;uch a change,
<PB N="21" REF="010562_0020_0F80BC3436CBAA08">
as I have been endeavouring to explain to you; who live in the neglect of GOD and Religion, and indulge your&s;elves in the practice of &s;in; you may conclude, without any further debate upon the matter, that you are yet in your natural &s;tate, a &s;tate of death and ruin.&mdash; But with re&s;pect to &s;uch of you as have experienced &s;omething like &s;uch a change, there is need of clo&s;er &s;crutiny. You have need to examine the matter, with much &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and impartiality, and to &s;eek the aid of the Holy Spirit in the &s;earch. For there are common opera|tions of the Spirit, as well as &s;pecial; common grace, as well as &s;aving: <HI>i. e.</HI> There are operations of the Spirit, whereby &s;olemn impre&s;&s;ions of the word of GOD are made upon the heart, and a con|&s;iderable alteration is effected, which, yet, come &s;hort of a &s;aving change: or, in other words, they do not make the &s;ubject of them truly holy. Hence, deep convictions, illumination of the mind, and great emotions of the affections. This, our LORD teaches by the Parable of the &s;tony ground hearers. Luke viii. 13. The Apo&s;tle &s;uppo&s;es per&s;ons to be enlightened, to ta&s;te of the heavenly gift, be made partakers of the Holy Gho&s;t, to ta&s;te the good word of GOD, and the powers of the world to come, who yet may fall away &s;o, as that it is impo&s;&s;ible to renew them to repentance. Heb. vi. 4, 5. Hence, great external reformation, and zeal in the practice of religious duties for a &s;ea&s;on; like Herod, who heard John the Bapti&s;t gladly, and did many things. Mark vi. 20. Here are effects re&s;embling true grace, yet come &s;hort of it. Many too who have had (as the event at la&s;t &s;hews) only common grace, have high confidences, and (as they apprehend) &s;trong a&s;&s;urance of their ju&s;tified, converted &s;tate;
<PB N="22" REF="010562_0021_0F80BC34CCA89DA8">
&s;tronger confidence, than many exerci&s;ed &s;ince Chri&s;tians.&mdash;That you have been the &s;ubjects of very deep impre&s;&s;ions of the word of GOD, and have experienced a great alteration, you can not doubt; but whether they have gone further than common grace; whether it is a thorough and &s;av|ing change, is the que&s;tion. Nor will your &s;trong|e&s;t confidence of your gracious &s;tate, of it&s;elf, prove the matter to be &s;o, unle&s;s it is founded on &s;criptural evidence of a work of &s;aving grace in the heart, an&s;wering to the characters of grace in the word of GOD, it is a &s;ign of pre&s;umption rather than grace.&mdash;The reality and truth of grace is not im|mediately &s;elf-evident, but mu&s;t be di&s;cerned by comparing the experiences of the heart, and their influence on the life, with the unerring rule of God's Word&mdash;indeed, when the &s;oul embraces CHRIST by faith, from the very nature of that ex|erci&s;e, it will have &s;ome &s;weet &s;en&s;e of the mercy and grace of GOD appearing in that way of &s;alvation, &s;uch as will introduce a refre&s;hing calm and peace into the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed con&s;cience: and that, in propor|tion to the &s;trength of faith, and the clearne&s;s of its views.&mdash;I would not &s;ay that there may not be a real &s;aving clo&s;ure with CHRIST, when yet there may be &s;uch ob&s;curity in faith's views, and &s;o much weakne&s;s in its exerci&s;e, as not to afford &s;en|&s;ible comfort, but only relieve the &s;oul from &s;ink|ing, though the &s;oul cannot re&s;t there. I believe, there are in&s;tances of this. But for the mo&s;t part, I apprehend, at the &s;oul's clo&s;ure with CHRIST, &s;uch a&s;toni&s;hing &s;cenes of mercy and grace open to view, and &s;uch di&s;coveries of the glory of GOD, and ex|cellency of divine things, as make the &s;oul exceed|ingly to rejoice, with joy un&s;peakable and full of
<PB N="23" REF="010562_0022_0F80BC34F844C518">
glory. While the believer is taken up with the&s;e views, and feels his &s;oul re&s;ting upon the righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of CHRIST, he cannot but have a lively hope of the mercy of GOD, yea, for the pre&s;ent, does not doubt of it. But this is very different from a fixed a&s;&s;urance of his gracious &s;tate. For when the&s;e views are abated, the divine pre&s;ence is with|drawn, and corruptions (which the Chri&s;tian was ready to flatter him&s;elf, he &s;hould never feel any more) are again felt in the heart, it is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that the young Chri&s;tian (who had very different expectations) will call all in que&s;tion again. Renewed light, and exerci&s;es of faith again relieve him: yet &s;ucceeding darkne&s;s temptation and exerci&s;e with the indwelling corruptions of his heart may from time to time fill him with fear and jealou&s;ies of him&s;elf. I make no doubt, but there are in&s;tances of &s;uch, who, at their fir&s;t clo&s;ure with CHRIST, are favoured with a &s;criptural fixed a&s;&s;urance of their gracious &s;tate. But this is not a common ca&s;e. Such a&s;&s;urance is, u&s;ually, the con|&s;equence of a cour&s;e of experience, after many con|flicts and repeated &s;elf-examination. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">To &s;uppo&s;e that the very e&s;&s;ence or nature of regeneration, and the very fir&s;t act of faith includes a full a&s;&s;urance, by an im|mediate witne&s;s of the Spirit, te&s;tifying the per&s;on's ju&s;tification, and gracious &s;tate as &s;ome do, is to &s;uppo&s;e, that faith and rege|neration cannot exi&s;t without this a&s;&s;urance; that without this immediate witne&s;s of the Spirit, faith and grace are not. And that is to &s;uppo&s;e, that regeneration is before it is. For the mat|ter te&s;tified is the per&s;on's renegeration, which pre-&s;uppo&s;es its exi&s;tence, and that it is &s;omething di&s;tinct from this witne&s;s con|cerning it. And yet, according to this notion, it is not previous to this witne&s;s, nor di&s;tinct from it; which is a contradiction. It is al&s;o to &s;uppo&s;e, that in a&s;&s;uring Chri&s;tians, the Holy Spirit does not witne&s;s <HI>together with their &s;pirits,</HI> as the Scriptures declare, Rom. viii. 16. but by an immediate witne&s;s, independent on any witne&s;s of their own &s;pirit. For the witne&s;s of their &s;pirit con&s;i&s;ts in a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of what they have experienced, and mu&s;t &s;up|po&s;e the thing witne&s;&s;ed, to be before this witne&s;s about it, in the order of time as well as the order of nature. And if &s;o, how long, or how &s;hort the time may be, before the Holy Spirit adds his wit|ne&s;s to the witne&s;s of their own &s;pirits. I think, none can de|termine.</NOTE> Many exer|ci&s;ed chri&s;tians, too, have their attention &s;o taken up with the corruptions and wickedne&s;s of their hearts, and &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, with a &s;en&s;e thereof, as to overlook their oppo&s;ition, and the principles of that oppo&s;ition. And this is a great &s;ource of their doubts and fears; from which, a careful examina|tion
<PB N="24" REF="010562_0023_0F80BC3A97209010">
of the rea&s;ons of their di&s;tre&s;s, and the prin|ciples, and manner of their oppo&s;ition would tend to relieve them. Now from all the&s;e con&s;iderations, it appears, how highly nece&s;&s;ary a very &s;trict exa|mination of your&s;elves is, upon this intere&s;ting matter; on the one hand, to prevent your &s;ettling upon a fal&s;e foundation; on the other, in order to di&s;cover the evidence of true grace where it does exi&s;t, and &s;o remove groundle&s;s fears of &s;incere Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>THAT you may examine this matter with advan|tage, it will be nece&s;&s;ary, that you attentively con|&s;ider the dictinction between common and &s;aving grace.&mdash;For your a&s;&s;i&s;tance herein, I would ju&s;t &s;ugge&s;t, 1&s;t. that whatever light may be let into the mind by the common influence of the &s;pirit, its only effects &s;eem to be the commotion of the pa&s;|&s;ions, and &s;ome temporary reformation, and zeal in the external practice of Religion. But the will is not &s;weetly bowed, and brought to &s;ubmit to the Go&s;pel. The &s;inner does not come out of him&s;elf to CHRIST'S righteou&s;ne&s;s, as his only refuge: he does not renounce his own righteou&s;ne&s;s as filthy rags. If he &s;eems to tru&s;t in CHRIST, his primary encouragement is from &s;ome apprehended goodne&s;s
<PB N="25" REF="010562_0024_0F80BC3C0E86D388">
in him&s;elf, or &s;ome good affection, and not alone from a view of the glorious fulne&s;s in CHRIST, and the freene&s;s of the grace of GOD in him, to the mo&s;t wretched and unworthy of &s;inners. Hence, there is no truly &s;piritual temper and di&s;po&s;ition formed in the heart.&mdash;2. The effects of common grace are tran&s;ient, and the zeal and engagedne&s;s in religion, thence ari&s;ing, &s;oon pa&s;&s;es away. It may continue for a while, but in time of temptation, &s;uch per|&s;ons fall away; for they have no root in them&s;elves. Luke viii. 13. They have no abiding principle of life. Their religion &s;ub&s;ides into a lifele&s;s form. Their hearts return to their former habitual cold|ne&s;s and carnality. They have no &s;uch habitual tendency towards GOD, &s;uch frequent breathings and pantings after him, &s;uch re&s;tle&s;s unea&s;ine&s;s in his ab&s;ence; &s;uch oppo&s;ition to, and victory over temptation and &s;in; &s;uch frequent exerci&s;es of re|pentance, and quickening of grace into life and ex|erci&s;e, as true Chri&s;tians have.&mdash;Bring the&s;e mat|ters clo&s;e home to your&s;elves, I pray you; &s;earch and &s;ee how the ca&s;e &s;tands with you.

It is very true, experience only can give you a thorough clear idea of it, yet ye can, at lea&s;t, &s;o far take up the repre&s;entation of the matter in the word of GOD, as to learn from it, that it mu&s;t be a very great change in the whole man, and that a temper, directly contrary to that, which you now feel, mu&s;t obtain in you.&mdash;For want of attending to this, many take up with &s;uperficial appearances, apparent good de&s;ires, fla&s;hes of affections, and &s;ome external reformation as evidences of regene|ration, tho' they have no univer&s;al change in the whole &s;oul, nor any abiding new principles and temper.&mdash;Others again imagine, that if ever this ble&s;&s;ed change &s;hall take place in them, they will have &s;ome extraordinary witne&s;s of the Holy Spirit, a&s;&s;uring them of their ju&s;tification and regeneration; and that faith contains an a&s;&s;urance of a per&s;onal in|tere&s;t in CHRIST, in its very nature. Hence, they are altogether taken up in de&s;iring and praying for this, and neglect every other con&s;ideration.&mdash;But this is not the fir&s;t thing to be obtained. Such a&s;|&s;urance is the fruit of faith, and the re&s;ult of expe|rience.&mdash;The fir&s;t thing you are to &s;eek for, is to be &s;o inlightened in the knowledge of the all &s;ufficient fulne&s;s of CHRIST'S righteou&s;ne&s;s, and the glory of that way of &s;alvation, as that your wills may be per&s;uaded to acquie&s;ce in it with &s;weet complacen|cy and to yield your&s;elves to GOD. That ye may be brought to choo&s;e GOD him&s;elf as your portion;
<PB N="28" REF="010562_0027_0F80BC3E43F2B248">
to delight in holine&s;s and hate &s;in.&mdash;3. At the foot|&s;tool of &s;overeign grace. Re&s;olve to continue crying to GOD, and cea&s;e not till you obtain. Wicked and corrupt as you are, and though you are unable to change your own hearts, yet GOD, who created the natural world, can create your depraved &s;ouls a-new. And he is infinitely gracious; he has com|pa&s;&s;ion on whom he will have compa&s;&s;ion, and mer|cy on whom he will have mercy; &s;o that it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth, but of GOD that &s;heweth mercy. Rom. ix. 15, 16.&mdash;But while you cry unto GOD, con&s;ider your&s;elves as ob|jects of meer mercy and grace, who are utterly un|worthy of any favour. Nor can you do any to merit the divine grace. If he vi&s;it you with mercy, it will be according to the good plea&s;ure of his own will. Yet it is in the u&s;e of means that GOD is plea|&s;ed to meet with &s;inners: he has made it your duty to wait upon him, and has told you, that for this will he be enquired of by the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, to do it for them. Ezek. xxxvi. 37.</P>
<P><HI>Reflection</HI> V. THIS &s;ubject loudly calls upon care|le&s;s &s;inners to awake out of their carnal &s;ecurity, and lay to heart their great danger, and ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;upernatural work of divine grace, to make them new creatures in CHRIST JESUS.&mdash; Without holine&s;s, no man &s;hall &s;ee the LORD. Heb. xii. 14. The happine&s;s of rational creatures depends upon the favours and friend&s;hip of GOD. The enjoyment of GOD mu&s;t be by way of friendly intercour&s;e and communion. Now all friend&s;hip is mutual between the parties, and ari&s;es from a conformity or agreeablene&s;s of the parties each to the other. But &s;inners, in their natural &s;tate, are
<PB N="29" REF="010562_0028_0F80BC3EBADA40F0">
altogether oppo&s;ed to GOD and holine&s;s. Their re|li&s;hes and plea&s;ures are earthly and carnal. The ten|dency of their hearts, their inclinations are to &s;in; their delight is in it, in one way or other, and that continually. And con&s;equently, they have a fixed aver&s;ion to the divine government, and enmity again&s;t GOD. Therefore, they mu&s;t be equally the objects of the divine aver&s;ion and abhorrence. Hence it follows, that the nature of one or the other of the parties mu&s;t be changed, before they can come together, or have any fellow&s;hip. There|fore, this change mu&s;t take place in &s;inners, and the moral image of GOD, to which they are by na|ture, quite oppo&s;ed, mu&s;t be re&s;tored; or, they mu&s;t be cut off from his gracious pre&s;ence, and fall under his dread re&s;entments forever.&mdash;Poor &s;inners, is it fit you &s;hould be ea&s;y and at re&s;t in &s;uch a ca&s;e as this? Mu&s;t you not be forever mi|&s;erable and undone, if you die in your pre&s;ent con|dition? Do but ob&s;erve the prevailing temper and plea&s;ures of your own hearts; the cour&s;e of your practice, and tendency of your lives. Can you per&s;wade your&s;elves, that you are &s;piritual, and re|li&s;h the things of GOD? and that the frame and temper of your hearts &s;uits the &s;tate and entertain|ments of Heaven? Are you not earthly, and &s;uch as mind the things of the fle&s;h? therefore, you are po&s;ting, as fa&s;t as time can carry you, to ever|la&s;ting ruin. I be&s;eech you, to enter upon &s;ome &s;erious &s;olemn con&s;ideration of your ca&s;e.&mdash;Do not harden your hearts, by giving loo&s;e reins to your lu&s;ts and &s;inful practices. Do not give your&s;elves up to di&s;&s;ipation and &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures. Keep at a di&s;tance from temptations to &s;in. One cannot take fire into his bo&s;om, and not be burned. Who&s;oever will
<PB N="30" REF="010562_0029_0F80BC3F9A6917D8">
throw him&s;elf into the way of temptation, may ex|pect to be entangled. Avoid the pre&s;ent public &s;nare in this city, I mean the entertainments of the Theatre. Whatever preten&s;ions to the expo&s;ing of vice are alledged in its favour, yet, &s;urely, the vicious characters are, in the fir&s;t place, acted. When, by the&s;e exhibitions, the vicious pa&s;&s;ions of the corrupt heart are enflamed, the alledged mo|ral is either not at all ob&s;erved, or, if it is &s;et in view, it has not any influence. GOD has not ap|pointed the &s;tage as a mean of the reformation of mankind, and therefore, we have no rea&s;on to ex|pect his ble&s;&s;ing upon it, without which nothing will be effectual for that purpo&s;e: nor is it attended upon with any &s;uch view. Yea, it has been the complaint of every age, that it has promoted im|morality and impiety. And certainly, facts mu&s;t expo&s;e the vanity of every &s;pecious pretence to the contrary. Many, by attending the &s;tage, have learned arts of intrigue, and methods of accom|pli&s;hing wicked de&s;igns, which, otherwi&s;e, pro|bably, they would never have known. What though it may have fared ill with the per&s;on, who&s;e vicious character is acted? Will this deter a &s;inner, unawed by the divine threatenings, from pur&s;uing the &s;ame cour&s;e? No; he hopes it will &s;ucceed better with him; and thus, prompted by lu&s;t enflamed, he ru&s;hes into an imitation, whene|ver he has a proper opportunity. I would &s;olemn|ly warn you not to run the ri&s;k of &s;uch dangerous con&s;equences. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">I will not undertake to determine, whether a public &s;tage might be &s;o contrived and regulated, as to render it, at lea&s;t, in|nocent, <HI>i. e.</HI> not dangerous to the morals, or in &s;ome re&s;pects even u&s;eful. But, I believe, &s;uch a &s;tage would not an&s;wer the pur|po&s;es of our comedians. He, who appears as an advocate for the theatre, &s;hould con&s;ider it as in fact it is; and not attempt to im|po&s;e upon the public, by plau&s;ible &s;uppo&s;itions of a well regulated Stage, without &s;ettling the idea of it, and which, the writer knows, does not any where exi&s;t.&mdash;He mu&s;t al&s;o know, that our comedians &s;eem greatly afraid of any &s;uch effects, as are mo&s;t plau&s;ibly alledged, in favour of the &s;tage's u&s;efulne&s;s, and very careful to prevent them. Therefore, lea&s;t tragedy &s;hould too deeply affect, a force mu&s;t &s;ucceed, in order, if po&s;&s;ible, to eraze every &s;erious impre&s;&s;ion.</NOTE> O &s;irs, I pray you, attend the

means of grace with con&s;cientious diligence, &s;tudy carefully, and with application to your&s;elves, the important doctrines of religion, con&s;ider your lat|ter end, commune with your own hearts, and ex|amine whither you are tending; be much in earne&s;t prayer to GOD: O pro&s;trate your&s;elves at the throne of grace.&mdash;Though there be no certain nece&s;&s;ary connection between all this, and your obtaining the &s;pecial grace of GOD. (For GOD is a &s;overeign in the di&s;pen&s;ation of his mercy to &s;inners, and can never be brought under obligations to any) yet, none ever obtained grace in a &s;tate of carnal &s;ecuri|ty. In this way of earne&s;tly &s;eeking GOD, all who ever have obtained mercy, found it. Without be|ing &s;olemnly engaged in &s;uch a cour&s;e, as I have here hinted at, you cannot be &s;aid to wait upon GOD, or to be &s;eeking &s;alvation. Yea, by your carele&s;s neglect, you are ju&s;tly chargeable with choo&s;ing your own death.&mdash;Surely, you cannot ra|tionally imagine, that your pre&s;ent cour&s;e tends to eternal life. For can you think, a carnal mind is life and peace?&mdash;Your precious immortal &s;ouls are or greater value than the whole world: and will you be content to loo&s;e them for trifles, and a thing of nought? What will it profit a man, if he &s;hould gain the whole world, and loo&s;e his own &s;oul, or what &s;hall a man give in exchange for his &s;oul? Mat. xvi. 26. Now is the accepted time, now is the day of &s;alvation; to-day, if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts. Time is po&s;ting

on, and when it &s;hall come to a clo&s;e with you, all opportunity of obtaining grace will be over forever. What profit will ye then have of your &s;en&s;ual plea|&s;ures, &s;inful indulgences, and carnal &s;ecurity, of which you will indeed be a&s;hamed? Take no re&s;t, I pray you, in your pre&s;ent condition. Seek ye the LORD, while he may be found, call upon him, while he is near. For which purpo&s;e, may GOD, of infinite mercy, give you his HOLY SPIRIT, for CHRIST'S &s;ake. Amen.</P>
