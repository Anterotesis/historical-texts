</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_FROM the&s;e Words, con&s;ider'd in their Con|nection and Dependance, I might rai&s;e a Variety of in&s;tructive Notes, for your profitable and plea&s;ing Entertainment. But this would &s;ome|thing carry me away from the &s;pecial De&s;ign I had in chu&s;ing this Text; which was, to lead you into &s;ome Meditations agreable to the pre&s;ent Sea&s;on, the Commencement of a <HI>New Year,</HI> &mdash; after a <HI>wonderful Year</HI> of great Deliverances and &s;ignal Mercies; tho' &s;haded with a Mix|ture of cloudy and afflictive Di&s;pen&s;ations. <HI>I will &s;ing of Mercy and Judgment: unto Thee, O Lord, will I &s;ing.</HI></P>
<P>To commemorate the <HI>Works</HI> of God, and <HI>remember the Years of the right Hand of the mo&s;t High,</HI> is a Duty of perpetual, as well as univer&s;al Obligation, and can never be <HI>out of Sea&s;on:</HI> but on &s;uch a Day as this, it appears to be eminently <HI>in Sea&s;on;</HI> it &s;eems the &s;pecial <HI>Duty of the Day.</HI> &mdash; It has been the Practice of God's Children (a very fit and rea&s;onable Practice) to take &s;ome peculiar Notice of the <HI>Beginning</HI> and <HI>Ending</HI> of the <HI>Year,</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="005947_0004_102727B32FC6DD90">
in their &s;olemn Meditations and religious Exerci&s;es. And while we are careful to avoid every Thing of a &s;uper&s;titious A&s;pect, not <HI>turning back to weak and beggarly Elements,</HI> nor <HI>ob&s;erving Days and Months and Times and Years</HI> (from a Principle of <HI>Con&s;cience toward God,</HI> &s;trictly, as if any Sea&s;on had the &s;ame Character of <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> upon it as the <HI>Lord's Day</HI>) but only employing common Time to holy Purpo&s;es, as we have Opportunity, from a Prin|ciple of Zeal toward God, and of Care for our Souls; I cannot but think it a laudable Cu&s;tom, to <HI>begin</HI> and <HI>end</HI> the Year with the Exerci&s;es of more &s;olemn Devotion. It &s;eems to fall within the Limits of tho&s;e general Rules, &mdash; <HI>Walk circum&s;pectly, not as Fools, but as Wi&s;e, redeeming the Time: &mdash; Gird up the Loins of your Mind: &mdash; Stabli&s;h your Hearts; for the Coming of the Lord draweth nigh: &mdash; Be diligent, that you may be found of Him in Peace, without Spot, and blamele&s;s.</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">By Means of the Abu&s;e of <HI>Chri&s;tmas-Holidays,</HI> when many, that pretend to commemorate one of the mo&s;t glorious Facts in the &s;acred Story, our <HI>Lord's Nativity,</HI> do on that Occa&s;ion indulge a loo&s;e Behaviour, Idlene&s;s, and &s;en&s;ual Exce&s;s, com|monly more than at other Times, it's to be fear'd the Year is <HI>begun</HI> and <HI>concluded</HI> in &s;uch a Manner by Multitudes, that &s;carce any Part of it &s;eems pro&s;tituted &s;o much as this Sea&s;on, to the Service of Sin and the Di&s;grace of Chri&s;tianity, by <HI>making Pro|vi&s;ion for the Fle&s;h to fulfil the Lu&s;ts thereof,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>putting on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>Among the religious Exerci&s;es of <HI>New Year's Day,</HI> a very fit one is <HI>Meditation:</HI> and on &s;uch Occa&s;ions one very fit Subject to employ our devout Thoughts, is that pointed out to us by the P&s;almi&s;t in our Text. <HI>I will remember the Years of the right Hand of the mo&s;t High: I will remember the Works of the LORD.</HI></P>
<P>Po&s;&s;ibly he may not here intend &s;trictly the Period of a <HI>Year;</HI> but only in general, by <HI>Years</HI> he may mean the <HI>Times</HI> and <HI>Sea|&s;ons,</HI> wherein the <HI>Works</HI> were wrought, which he re&s;olves to recollect and celebrate. In the Context he u&s;es the Terms of <HI>Day</HI> and <HI>Year</HI> as equivalent. So by <HI>Years</HI> in our Text may be under&s;tood in general the <HI>Aera</HI>'s of God's marvellous Works, the <HI>Times</HI> or <HI>Sea&s;ons</HI> of his remarkable Di&s;pen&s;ations of Kind|ne&s;s. &mdash; Only, it may be, &s;o much is hinted, &s;ometimes at lea&s;t,
<PB N="3" REF="005947_0005_102727B71F3C0478">
when the Word <HI>Year</HI> is made U&s;e of, &mdash; as in our Text, <HI>the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ears of the right Hand of the mo&s;t High,</HI> &mdash; that it refers to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">vine Works <HI>protracted</HI> to a con&s;iderable Length of Time; it may point at a <HI>long Sea&s;on</HI> of glorious divine Operations. A <HI>Year</HI> being the mo&s;t extended Period in the natural Divi&s;ion of Time, this Word may be cho&s;en to denote a <HI>Series</HI> of Days of God's Power and Goodne&s;s, a <HI>continued Cour&s;e</HI> of his wonderful Works to the Children of Men.</P>
<P>However, taking the Term in its literal Signification, for the Space of Duration properly denominated a <HI>Year,</HI> it mu&s;t be granted, that &s;ome <HI>Years</HI> are eminently <HI>the Years of the right Hand of the mo&s;t High.</HI></P>
<P>We mu&s;t note here, 'tis but by a Figure that <HI>Hands</HI> are a&s;cribed to God, who is a <HI>Spirit,</HI> and hath not <HI>bodily</HI> Parts or Pa&s;&s;ions as Men have. The <HI>Hand</HI> being one of the comelie&s;t, &s;tronge&s;t, mo&s;t active and important Members of the human Sy&s;tem, of con&s;tant and exten&s;ive U&s;e, &s;erving to a va&s;t Variety of valuable Purpo&s;es in human Life; hence, while the Scripture conde&s;cends to accommodate its Language to our Capacity, in de&s;cribing the ble&s;&s;ed God, we find his <HI>Hand</HI> fre|quently &s;poken of: which yet is to be under&s;tood only as ex|pre&s;s'd by Way of Analogy or Allu&s;ion, and principally imports the divine Influence and Activity, or the Exertment of God's Power and Perfections on the Creature. &mdash; We may further ob&s;erve, that as <HI>Man,</HI> to whom &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions allude, is pri|vileged with a Duplicity of <HI>Hands,</HI> a right and a left, hence in the &s;ame analogical Way a <HI>Plurality</HI> of this excellent Member is attributed to God in Scripture, and under the expre&s;s Di&s;tinction too of <HI>his right Hand</HI> and <HI>his left;</HI> &mdash; tho' when the <HI>Hand</HI> of God is mention'd with one or other of the&s;e Epithets join'd to it, 'tis the former that is mo&s;t commonly u&s;ed. So in our Text, <HI>the Years of the Right Hand of the mo&s;t High.</HI></P>
<P>It mayn't be unfit to note here more particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Right Hand</HI> commonly being the <HI>&s;tronge&s;t</HI> and the <HI>mo&s;t u&s;ed,</HI> and having a greater <HI>Aptitude</HI> for Exerci&s;e, hence this does mo&s;t &s;ignificantly expre&s;s <HI>Power,</HI> and <HI>Action,</HI> and <HI>Skill:</HI> and when figuratively apply'd to God, it often denotes his infi|nite Strength, Activity, and Dexterity in Operation. So <HI>the Years of the right Hand of the mo&s;t High</HI> may intend the Years of his mighty Works, and glorious Atchievements, di&s;playing
<PB N="4" REF="005947_0006_102727B8B0A579D8">
his immen&s;e Wi&s;dom, mo&s;t active Nature, and divine Omni|potence.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Right Hand</HI> is of all the Members of the Body one of the mo&s;t <HI>beloved</HI> and <HI>endeared</HI> to us. This is the Favourite-Hand. In Allu&s;ion to which Property, the Mortification of a darling Lu&s;t is compar'd in Scripture to the <HI>Cutting off a Right Hand.</HI> &mdash; The Patriarch <HI>Jacob</HI>'s Son <HI>Benjamin</HI> (which &s;ignifies <HI>a Son of the Right Hand</HI> had his Name given him for this Rea&s;on, becau&s;e he was the Son of his peculiar <HI>Affection.</HI> &mdash; So <HI>the Years of the right Hand of the mo&s;t High</HI> may intend &s;uch as have been di&s;tingui&s;h'd by the Smiles of Heaven, and been full of the Ble&s;&s;ing of the Lord, &mdash; remarkable Years of his Loving-kind|ne&s;s and Favour, wherein his <HI>good Hand</HI> has been &s;ignalized towards his People; &mdash; and &s;uch as may be called the <HI>Favourite-Years,</HI> which he hath as it were <HI>embraced with his Right Hand.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Right Hand</HI> is &s;ignificant, among Men, of <HI>Dignity</HI> and <HI>Preheminence.</HI> The Right Hand is that on which, as the worthie&s;t, the <HI>Signet</HI> has been wont to be worn: and in Token of Honour, Per&s;ons of Di&s;tinction are placed on our Right Hand. Hence Chri&s;t's Exaltation in the heavenly Places is repre&s;ented in figurative Language, by his <HI>&s;itting down on the Right Hand of the Maje&s;ty on high:</HI> which imports his being near and dear to God, and crown'd with &s;uperlative Glory. Hence he is &s;aid to be <HI>&s;et down with his Father on his Throne:</HI> and is called <HI>the Man of his right Hand.</HI> To him God hath <HI>&s;worn by his Right Hand;</HI> Him hath God <HI>exalted with his Right Hand;</HI> Him hath He exalted <HI>to his Right Hand;</HI> and he is indeed <HI>his Right Hand,</HI> the <HI>Right Hand of his Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and the Strength of his Salvation. &mdash; So the Expre&s;&s;ion in our Text, <HI>the Years of the right Hand of the mo&s;t High,</HI> may be under&s;tood of Years which God has emi|nently dignify'd, rai&s;ed in Fame above other Years, and put a remarkable Lu&s;tre and Di&s;tinction upon, by great Works of the Arm of the Lord bringing Salvation and Pro&s;perity, that make them &s;hine in the Annals of the Church. The&s;e may be called <HI>Years crowned with his Goodne&s;s,</HI> as the Expre&s;&s;ion is in <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 65.11. &mdash; He hath <HI>&s;tretched out his Right Hand,</HI> and <HI>laid it on their Head,</HI> honouring them (as the <HI>Fir&s;t born</HI>) with a double Portion of his Ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="005947_0007_102727BA8CCA3350">It may be &s;ubjoin'd,</P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>Right Hand</HI> is given among Men, one to another, in Token of <HI>Covenanting,</HI> and profe&s;&s;ing <HI>Friend&s;hip.</HI> Holding up the <HI>Hand</HI> was the ancient Mode of taking a &s;olemn <HI>Oath:</HI> and <HI>giving the Hand</HI> has always been practi&s;ed as a federal Rite, as a Signal of Agreement, and an Expre&s;&s;ion of Friendline&s;s. This was the Token between <HI>Jebu</HI> and <HI>Jebonadab,</HI> when he came to meet him; <HI>Is thy Heart right, as my Heart is with thy Heart? If it be, give me thine Hand.</HI> In this View the Apo&s;tle u&s;es the Phra&s;e; When <HI>James, Cephas,</HI> and <HI>John</HI> perceived the Grace that was given unto me, <HI>they gave to me and</HI> Barnabas <HI>the Right Hands of Fellow&s;hip.</HI> &mdash; Thus the <HI>Years of the right Hand of the mo&s;t High</HI> may intend the &s;pecial Sea&s;ons of God's <HI>covenanting</HI> with his People, giving them the A&s;&s;urances of his Friend&s;hip, and confirming his Promi&s;es by an <HI>Oath,</HI> to &s;hew the Immutabi|lity of his Coun&s;el. The Lord is &s;aid to <HI>&s;wear by his Right Hand;</HI> and that's the Form of the Oath, <HI>I lift up my Hand to Heaven, and &s;ay, I live for ever.</HI> Be&s;ides the <HI>Oath</HI> which he &s;ware to <HI>Abraham,</HI> there were <HI>Promi&s;es made to the Fathers</HI> both before and after him. The Lord &s;ware unto <HI>David,</HI> both the Type and Antitype; and he &s;pake by the Mouth of all the holy <HI>Prophets,</HI> which have been &s;ince the World began; remembring his <HI>holy Covenant,</HI> and renewing the Promi&s;es of it from Age to Age; declaring him&s;elf the God of the righteous Seed, and avouching them to be his peculiar People. In particular, he often repeated the&s;e federal Tran&s;actions with <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> but more &s;olemnly in <HI>Horeb;</HI> and finally, having broken down the Wall of Partition, he has extended his Covenant to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> &s;ay|ing to them which in Times pa&s;t were not a People, <HI>Thou art my People,</HI> and bringing them to <HI>avouch the God of I&s;rael for the Lord their God.</HI> &mdash; Now &s;uch <HI>Covenanting-Times</HI> may be included in the Idea of <HI>the Years of the Right Hand of the mo&s;t High:</HI> and the&s;e as God is ever <HI>mindful</HI> of, &s;o &s;hould we; <HI>taking Heed to our&s;elves, le&s;t we forget the Covenant of the Lord our God; for our God is a con&s;uming Fire, a jealous God.</HI></P>
<P>Thus I have a&s;&s;ign'd &s;ome of the mo&s;t probable Sen&s;es of the Phra&s;e in our Text. Po&s;&s;ibly they may all be comprehended: tho' Expo&s;itors generally interpret it as u&s;ed here with a &s;pecial View to the fir&s;t Sen&s;e, and more directly intending the peculiar Sea&s;ons of God's di&s;playing his <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Perfection</HI> in great and wonderful <HI>Works</HI> of Goodne&s;s. And indeed this is counte|nanced
<PB N="6" REF="005947_0008_102727BC28C2B910">
by the Connection of the Words. <HI>I will remember the Years of the Right Hand of the mo&s;t High: I will remember the Works of the Lord: Surely I will remember thy Wonders of old,</HI> &amp;c. Then in the following Ver&s;es the P&s;almi&s;t proceeds to celebrate the mighty Acts of God, and his gracious Appearances for his People. &mdash; Accordingly in the pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e I &s;hall have a particular Eye to this Sen&s;e, as primarily intended; tho' not excluding the others. &mdash; And when the Text &s;peaks of <HI>remem|bring the Works of the Lord,</HI> and <HI>the Years of his Right Hand,</HI> we are to under&s;tand by this, not a meer &s;peculative Exerci&s;e of the Mind and Memory on the&s;e Objects, but al&s;o corre&s;pondent Actions of the Judgment and Con&s;cience, Will and Affections, with agreable Practice and Behaviour in the outward Life.</P>
<P>Having premi&s;ed the&s;e general Ob&s;ervations, I &s;hall now di&s;tinctly mention &s;ome of tho&s;e <HI>Years</HI> of God's Right Hand, and &s;ome of tho&s;e <HI>Works</HI> of the mo&s;t High, which challenge from us this devotional and practical Commemoration.</P>
<P N="1">1. I begin with commending to your Remembrance the Year of the <HI>Creation,</HI> and its mighty Wonders.</P>
<P>This is a great and notable <HI>Year of the Lord;</HI> as it were, <HI>the Beginning of his Strength,</HI> and the <HI>Fir&s;t-born</HI> among the <HI>Years of the Right Hand of the mo&s;t High.</HI> This ancient Year, the fir&s;t Date of Time, mu&s;t never be forgotten, when we profe&s;s to <HI>remember the Works of the Lord,</HI> and to <HI>con&s;ider the Days of old, the Years of ancient Times.</HI> It mu&s;t ever be remembred, that <HI>in the Beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth,</HI> and formed all Things by the Word of his Power. Then his <HI>Right Hand</HI> became glorious in Power, and wrought wondrou&s;ly: He re|vealed his <HI>mighty Arm,</HI> &s;trong was his <HI>Hand,</HI> and high his <HI>Right Hand.</HI> Then the Greatne&s;s of his Excellency appeared; then he manife&s;ted forth his Glory, the Glory of his Strength, and Wi&s;dom, and Goodne&s;s, Sovereignty, and Al&s;ufficiency, in pro|ducing the&s;e Worlds out of Nothing, in forming them with &s;uch admirable Beauty and Harmony, filling them with &s;uch un&s;earch|able Riches, and &s;tocking them with &s;uch glorious Inhabitants: All which &s;hould come into our Remembrance. &mdash; We &s;hould <HI>con&s;ider his Heaven,</HI> the Work of his Fingers; and enter with our Meditations into the upper and invi&s;ible World, the Habita|tion of ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Angels.</HI> &mdash; But <HI>the Years of the Right Hand of the mo&s;t High</HI> is a Phra&s;e that calls our Thoughts down to this vi&s;ible
<PB N="7" REF="005947_0009_102727C0DA4B9140">
and lower World, the Stage of <HI>Time</HI> and the Seat of <HI>Mankind.</HI> The Sons of the Morning &s;aw that great Work, which the Lord did, when he created this Earth, and brought forth Man upon it: tho&s;e <HI>Morning-Stars</HI> &s;ang the Prai&s;es of their and our Creator, and &s;houted for Joy at the building this Temple, &s;acred to the Honour of his Name. The Lord him&s;elf <HI>rejoiced in the Works of his Hand:</HI> and upon a Review of the whole, pronounced <HI>all very good.</HI> He con&s;tantly claims it as his Prerogative to <HI>create,</HI> and glories in his Character of univer&s;al <HI>Creator.</HI> Thus &s;aith the Lord, <HI>I am the Fir&s;t, and I am the La&s;t; and be&s;ides Me there is no God. &mdash; I am the Lord that maketh all Things, that &s;tretcheth forth the Heavens alone, that &s;preadeth abroad the Earth by my &s;elf.</HI> And again, <HI>I have made the Earth, and created Man upon it; I, even my Hands have &s;tretched out the Heavens, and all their Ho&s;t have I commanded.</HI></P>
<P>Verily the Year of the <HI>Creation</HI> is one of the mo&s;t glorious and memorable <HI>Years of the Right Hand of the mo&s;t High.</HI> &mdash; The <HI>in|vi&s;ible Things of Him</HI> from the <HI>Creation</HI> of the World are clearly &s;een, being under&s;tood by the Things that are made, even <HI>his eternal Power and Godhead.</HI> &mdash; The <HI>Heavens</HI> declare his <HI>Glory;</HI> the <HI>Earth</HI> al&s;o is full of his <HI>Riches;</HI> at its fir&s;t Formation 'twas eminently &s;o. In its Production and E&s;tabli&s;hment, the <HI>Glory of the Lord</HI> brake forth with an a&s;toni&s;hing Lu&s;tre, and the <HI>Right Hand of his Power</HI> wrought marvellous Things without Num|ber. &mdash; Well may we adore the Creator in that Language, <HI>Who is a God like unto Thee! Glorious in Holine&s;s, fearful in Prai&s;es, doing Wonders. &mdash; Worthy art Thou, O Lord, to receive Glory, and Honour, and Power; for Thou ha&s;t created all Things, and for thy Plea&s;ure they are, and were created.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;hould often contemplate on the Glories of the <HI>Creation</HI> in its <HI>general</HI> View; and wi&s;ely apply the Meditation to its pro|per practical U&s;es, &mdash; to make us hate and mourn for Sin, which ca&s;ts Contempt on God and his wonderful Works, &mdash; to rai&s;e our Admiration of the divine Excellency, Fulne&s;s and Ble&s;&s;ed|ne&s;s of the great <HI>Creator,</HI> &mdash; to excite our Veneration, Love, Gratitude, with every other devout Pa&s;&s;ion; &mdash; particularly to confirm our Faith in the Promi&s;es of an al&s;ufficient God, &mdash; e&s;pecially with Re&s;pect to the coming Day of the <HI>Re&s;titution of all Things.</HI>&mdash;And &s;ince our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> the only Begotten of the Father, &s;u&s;tains in common with him this exalted Cha|racter of the <HI>Former of all Things,</HI> as well as the Saviour of his

Body the Church, this Reflection &s;hould e&s;tabli&s;h us in the Belief of his <HI>eternal Divinity,</HI> &s;o plainly taught us in the Scriptures: for <HI>He that built all Things is God.</HI> Hence, according to his Demand, <HI>all Men &s;hould honour the Son, even as they honour the Father.</HI> The <HI>Earth</HI> is the Lord's, and the Fulne&s;s thereof; we &s;hould therefore <HI>honour the Lord with our Sub&s;tance;</HI> and we &s;hould <HI>glorify him in all Things,</HI> con&s;ecrating our &s;elves and all our Enjoyments to his Service and Honour: Particularly as we <HI>believe</HI> in God the Father, &s;o &s;hould we al&s;o in God the Son, by whom he hath in the&s;e la&s;t Days &s;poken to us, <HI>by whom al&s;o he made the Worlds,</HI> and whom he hath appointed Heir of all Things. What a powerful Motive have we to the firme&s;t <HI>Tru&s;t</HI> in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;ince he is the <HI>Maker,</HI> and therefore <HI>Lord of all!</HI> And well may the con&s;cious <HI>Believer</HI> triumph in the Name of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> to whom he has committed and devoted him&s;elf. &mdash; But <HI>Sinners</HI> in <HI>Zion,</HI> on the contrary, may well be <HI>afraid,</HI> when they con&s;i|der <HI>Whom</HI> they de&s;pi&s;e and refu&s;e, even the <HI>great Creator</HI> and <HI>high Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of Heaven and Earth,</HI> the <HI>one Lawgiver</HI> that is able to &s;ave and to de&s;troy; who &s;pared not the <HI>old World,</HI> but brought a <HI>Flood</HI> upon the Ungodly, nor will &s;pare <HI>the World that now is,</HI> but <HI>re&s;erveth it unto Fire</HI> again&s;t the Day of Judgment and Per|dition of ungodly Men, which &s;hall &s;o come as a Thief in the Night, in the which the <HI>Heavens</HI> being on Fire &s;hall be di&s;&s;olved, and the Elements melt with fervent Heat, the <HI>Earth</HI> al&s;o and the Works therein &s;hall be burnt up.

Now indeed they are in a depraved State univer&s;ally, and the Wicked|ne&s;s of Man is great upon the Earth; <HI>nor can he be clean, that is born of a Woman:</HI> But from the Beginning it was not &s;o; for <HI>God made Man upright, &mdash; in the Image of God created he him,</HI> with a &s;uperior Light in his Under&s;tanding, a heavenly Bias on his Will and Affections, and a divine Rectitude in all the Powers of his intellectual and moral Nature; whereby he &s;hone at fir&s;t as a little <HI>Image</HI> of God upon Earth, and had the Bea&s;ts of the Field in League with him, a League of Friend&s;hip and Sub|mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Production of this noble Creature, <HI>Man,</HI> is celebrated every where in Scripture as a tran&s;cendent Work of divine Wi&s;|dom and Power, and the Account we have of it in the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Hi&s;tory is accordingly introduced with that peculiar En&s;ign of Coun&s;el and Solemnity, <HI>Let us make Man.</HI> &mdash; And truly if <HI>Man</HI> be con&s;ider'd in his twofold <HI>Nature</HI> and original <HI>Con&s;titution,</HI> he appears to have been <HI>fearfully and wonderfully made.</HI> &mdash; His <HI>Body</HI> an admirable Structure, full of My&s;tery and Glory, a meet Ta|bernacle for his pure and immortal Spirit, and the Temple of the living God, every Way fitly framed together, and exhibiting the infinite Skill and Perfection and Goodne&s;s of its divine Crea|tor. &mdash; But the <HI>Soul</HI> of Man &s;till more excellent, as it fir&s;t came out of his forming Hand; participating of the divine Nature, in its Spirituality and Immortality, in its Powers of Perception, Judgment and Choice, and in the Harmony, the moral Purity and Perfection of all its Faculties. &mdash; And above all the vi&s;ible Creation, <HI>Man</HI> had a con&s;picuous Re&s;emblance to his ble&s;&s;ed Maker and Sovereign, in the Dignity and Felicity of his exalted <HI>Condition;</HI> as having Dominion over all the other Creatures in this &s;ublunary World, &s;ituated in Paradi&s;e, the Centre of all ter|rene

Plea&s;ures, Riches and Glories, and enjoying the mo&s;t inti|mate Communion with his divine Maker.</P>
<P>What a happy and excelling Creature was <HI>Man</HI> in the Begin|ning! How dignify'd and di&s;tingui&s;h'd! An Angel in Fle&s;h, a Kind of terre&s;trial God, an illu&s;trious Image of the &s;upreme Maje&s;ty!</P>
<P>And how did his Maker exalt him by entring into <HI>Covenant</HI> with him, a Covenant of Friend&s;hip and of glorious Grace, con|taining the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t righteous Demands, as well as en|forced with the mo&s;t weighty Sanctions, perfectly adju&s;ted to his Nature and State, addre&s;&s;ing to his Rea&s;on and Con&s;cience, to his Hopes and Fears, and to every Pa&s;&s;ion of his Soul; and thus mo&s;t excellently calculated to &s;ecure his Obedience, and hereby his Happine&s;s! Surely this is a memorable Occurrence: one of the mo&s;t &s;ignal and admirable in the primitive Year of Won|ders.</P>
<P>But after all it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, there's one <HI>dark</HI> and mo&s;t <HI>melancholy</HI> Event (which not <HI>God,</HI> but <HI>Man</HI> only was the Author of) that eclip&s;ed the Glory of this <HI>Year of the Right Hand of the mo&s;t High,</HI> &s;pread a univer&s;al Gloom upon the Face of the Earth, turn'd Man out of Paradi&s;e, and degraded him to a Level with the brutal Herd, &mdash; I mean <HI>Adam</HI>'s <HI>Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion,</HI> in the Matter of the forbidden Fruit. An amazing Fall! and a horrid Guilt, that reach'd Heaven and &s;pread through all the Earth, that ter|minated not in his &s;ingle Per&s;on, but extends to his whole natu|ral Po&s;terity through all Generations! Alas, <HI>Man being in Ho|nour, under&s;tood not,</HI> but quickly corrupted his Way, and <HI>became like the Bea&s;ts that peri&s;h.</HI> God made him holy and happy, but with a mutable Nature and in a mutable State; and having in his adorable Sovereignty put him upon Trial, by a di&s;ciplinary Prohibition, he di&s;obey'd, and <HI>fell by Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion,</HI> lo&s;t the Image of God his Maker, forfeited the divine Pre&s;ence and Favour, and involved his numerous Progeny in Guilt and Ruin together with him&s;elf. For &s;o the Scripture teaches us to account for the pre&s;ent State of this evil World, &mdash; <HI>By one Man's Di&s;obedience many were made Sinners &mdash; By the Offence of one, Judgment came upon all Men to Condemnation &mdash; By one Man Sin entred into the World, and Death by Sin; and &s;o Death pa&s;&s;ed upon all Men, for that all have &s;inned.&mdash;In</HI> Adam <HI>all die.</HI>&mdash;And <HI>cur&s;ed</HI> was the very <HI>Ground for his Sake, the Creature by Rea&s;on of him was made &s;ub|ject to Vanity,</HI> and the Earth groans under the Burden of its

guilty Inhabitants, and the Effects of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Fall, even until now. Thus the Creation was &s;carce fini&s;h'd before <HI>Man</HI> re|volted, and by the Merit of his Sin filled this habitable Word with Darkne&s;s and Death, and introduced a mo&s;t formidable Train of Evils. <HI>This is for a Lamentation;</HI> and it &s;hould always be called to Mind with ju&s;t Re&s;entments of Shame and Grief, while we are recollecting the wondrous Events of <HI>the Year of God's</HI> crea|ting <HI>Hand.</HI></P>
<P>However, it &s;hould be remember'd too, that God our Maker, in his &s;overeign Grace, pre&s;ently upon the Fall of Man, pub|li&s;h'd the <HI>good Tidings of Peace;</HI> and opened a <HI>new Covenant,</HI> in the Promi&s;e, that <HI>the Seed of the Woman &s;hould brui&s;e the Serpent's Head,</HI> who had <HI>beguiled</HI> Eve <HI>through his Subtilty:</HI> &mdash; which im|ply'd a Declaration of God's gracious Purpo&s;e to <HI>vi&s;it and redeem his People,</HI> and to <HI>rai&s;e up a Horn of Salvation</HI> in his own ap|pointed Time.</P>
<P>Thus I have hinted at &s;ome of the memorable and &s;urprizing Occurrences of this fir&s;t <HI>Year of the Right Hand of the mo&s;t High,</HI> the Year of <HI>Creation.</HI></P>
<P>Now this &s;urely is a Year <HI>much to be remembred,</HI> and never for|gotten by us. While we read our <HI>Bible,</HI> we find it frequently reminding us of this memorable Year, and calling its remarkable Events to our Remembrance. Indeed it's here only, that we meet with the Hi&s;tory of the&s;e ancient Facts. How thankful &s;hould we be for the &s;acred Scriptures, to which we are indebted, as for peculiar Di&s;coveries of the Mind and Will of God, &s;o of his Works? In this divine Revelation to Mankind we have &s;uch Di&s;coveries as tran&s;cend tho&s;e of the mo&s;t improv'd Philo|&s;ophy, particularly in Relation to the <HI>fir&s;t Cau&s;e</HI> and the <HI>la&s;t End</HI> of all Things, the <HI>Origin of Good and Evil,</HI> the pri&s;tine <HI>perfect</HI> and pre&s;ent <HI>fallen</HI> States of Man, &amp;c. Di&s;coveries, of the la&s;t Importance to us, and &s;uch as &s;peak the <HI>Scriptures</HI> to be of in|comparable Excellency and U&s;efulne&s;s. How thankful &s;hould we be for this &s;ingular Privilege of Scripture-Revelation? How diligently &s;hould we con&s;ult it? And while we do &s;o, we &s;hall find it often reading to us entertaining Lectures on the Works of God, particularly tho&s;e in the memorable Year of <HI>Creation:</HI> calling this to our Thoughts, and &s;peaking of its various Events as de&s;erving our &s;olemn Attention and Con&s;ideration; in which therefore we &s;hould frequently exerci&s;e our &s;elves, &mdash; not on a mere <HI>Philo&s;ophic</HI> De&s;ign, but on <HI>Theological</HI> Principles, and with

a View to tho&s;e <HI>devotional</HI> and <HI>practical</HI> Ends, which this Me|ditation has in its Nature a Fitne&s;s to &s;ub&s;erve.</P>
<P>Our whole Life is not too much to be employ'd in the Com|memoration of God's wonderful Works in the Year of <HI>Creative.</HI> The longe&s;t Life, yea, Eternity it&s;elf, can never exhau&s;t the boundle&s;s Subject. We &s;hould enter early on the Bu&s;ine&s;s of remembring God and his Works. What &s;aith the Scripture <HI>I Remember now thy Creator in the Days of thy Youth.</HI> Under this his fir&s;t relative Character, we &s;hould all of us, Young and Old, be much in <HI>remembring the Lord our God.</HI> &mdash; We &s;hould remem|ber, that <HI>God made the Earth, and created Man upon it;</HI> gave him his Being, and this at fir&s;t a Being admirably excellent, at|tended with all the Advantages of intrin&s;ick Per&s;ection, and every de&s;irable external Accommodation. Our Commemoration of the&s;e Things &s;hould be frequent; nor merely contemplative, but influential on our Hearts and Lives.</P>
<P>Let it be &s;aid here di&s;tinctly,</P>
<P N="1">1. Con&s;idering the <HI>Production</HI> of Man, in its <HI>general</HI> or more &s;imple and ab&s;olute, View, it is to be <HI>remembred</HI> by us, with due Acknowledgments to God, practical and devotional.</P>
<P>We &s;hould confe&s;s God the <HI>fir&s;t Cau&s;e</HI> of Man's <HI>Exi&s;tence,</HI> the <HI>Origin</HI> of our <HI>Being,</HI> the Author of human <HI>Nature,</HI> in its very fir&s;t and all &s;ucce&s;&s;ive In&s;tances. And this <HI>Work of the Right Hand of the mo&s;t High</HI> is to be <HI>remembred</HI> by us in the Exerci&s;e of every corre&s;pondent Di&s;po&s;ition, and with all agreable De|portments. &mdash; We &s;hould &s;ee and own our common <HI>Obligations</HI> to God our Maker, and ever maintain a <HI>thankful</HI> Sen&s;e of the Riches of his creating Goodne&s;s. &mdash; We &s;hould, by often view|ing Him as <HI>Creator,</HI> &s;tudy to get and keep our Minds under the deepe&s;t Impre&s;&s;ion of our ab&s;olute <HI>Dependance</HI> on him; and learn the great Le&s;&s;on of intire <HI>Submi&s;&s;ion</HI> to his &s;overeign Will. &mdash;We &s;hould apply this Reflection to invigorate and enliven our Belief of a divine <HI>Providence,</HI> &s;uperintending the World moral, as well as natural; and learn accordingly to refer all our Affairs, all our Intere&s;ts (together with our Per&s;ons) to the divine Direction and Di&s;po&s;al, with a firm <HI>Confidence</HI> in God, as a Being perfectly &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve us, and to provide for us, whether in Rela|tion to Body or Soul, to Time or Eternity. &mdash; The Con&s;ideration of God as <HI>Creator</HI> &s;hould &s;erve al&s;o to awaken in us the mo&s;t humble <HI>Fear,</HI> and awful Apprehen&s;ions of him. This divine
<PB N="13" REF="005947_0015_102727D254BA0BA8">
Character &s;peaks his infinite Di&s;tance from us in Nature, his in|finite Dignity above us, his ab&s;olute Authority over us; there|fore &s;peaks him the ju&s;t Object of our highe&s;t Re&s;pect and &s;olemn Dread, and challenges our mo&s;t &s;olicitous Care to plea&s;e and ho|nour him, and to walk humbly before him.&mdash; Should we not al&s;o <HI>love,</HI> as well as reverence the Hand that formed us? Ought not our De&s;ire to be unto his Name, and to the Remembrance of him? As we are in a natural Sen&s;e <HI>the Offspring of God,</HI> &s;urely our heavenly <HI>Father</HI> de&s;erves our be&s;t Affections. Accordingly that is his Demand, <HI>My Son, give me thy Heart.</HI> A Demand founded in the mo&s;t perfect Rea&s;on, and approving it&s;elf to every enlighten'd Con&s;cience. How then can any of us (viler than the <HI>Ox,</HI> that knoweth his Owner) be &s;o &s;tupid and ungrateful, as not to <HI>inquire after God our Maker,</HI> but <HI>forget the Rock that beg at us!</HI> Or how can we deny him our whole Thought and Heart, who gave us our very Breath and Being! Yet <HI>this is our Manner from our Youth.</HI> &mdash; And how ab&s;urd our Conduct, while <HI>by breaking the Law</HI> we <HI>di&s;honour God</HI> that made us! Surely we ought to be <HI>in Subjection to the Father of Spirits,</HI> and <HI>learn Obedi|ence</HI> from this View of God. The <HI>Creator</HI> mu&s;t needs be the Lawgiver and the chief End of Man. He that made all Things <HI>for him&s;elf,</HI> has an undoubted Right of Propriety in and Domi|nion over them, and ju&s;tly claims a Tribute of Prai&s;e from them, according to their various Natures and Capacities: and mo&s;t certainly he propo&s;ed <HI>his own Glory</HI> as the &s;upreme De&s;ign of <HI>Man</HI>'s Creation, whom he fram'd with a Capacity of rendring to him a <HI>rea&s;onable Service,</HI> a voluntary active Homage, and reli|gious Wor&s;hip; thereby di&s;tingui&s;hing him from the <HI>Fowls of Heaven</HI> and <HI>Bea&s;ts of the Earth, that have no Under&s;tanding,</HI> to con&s;titute them fit Subjects of moral Government. Wherefore, as we would <HI>&s;hew our&s;elves Men,</HI> it becomes us to &s;tudy the Will of God, and be <HI>obedient</HI> in all Things. And how befitting the fallen Creature is that Prayer of the P&s;almi&s;t? <HI>Thy Hands,</HI> O God, <HI>have made and fa&s;hioned me; Give me Under&s;tanding, that I may learn thy Commandments.</HI>&mdash;Now (to add no more here) the Commandments which re&s;pect our <HI>Neighbour,</HI> as well as tho&s;e which more immediately re&s;pect God, are what we have to learn. That comprehen&s;ive and excellent Law, <HI>Thou &s;halt love thy Neighbour as thy &s;elf,</HI> receives Light and Force from the Con|&s;ideration of God as our original <HI>Creator</HI> and <HI>common Father.</HI> This Thought &s;hould re&s;train us from de&s;pi&s;ing, injuring, or

<P>But I go on to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="2">2. When we contemplate the <HI>Manner</HI> of Man's Production, and <HI>how</HI> he was form'd <HI>originally,</HI> this complex View of the Ca&s;e will afford us &s;till more Le&s;&s;ons of Wi&s;dom; and lead us to other practical U&s;es, to which we &s;hould apply our Reflections on the <HI>Year of God's</HI> creating <HI>Hand.</HI></P>
<P>Particularly as to Man's <HI>Body,</HI> when we remember that this was originally made <HI>out of the Du&s;t of the Ground,</HI> it &s;hould lead us to admire the infinite <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Skill</HI> of the Creator, in form|ing &s;o curious and comely a Fabrick, out of &s;uch mean and un|apt Materials: and to admire the <HI>My&s;tery</HI> of Wi&s;dom in the <HI>Union</HI> of two &s;uch di&s;tant Natures, a heavenly Spirit and earthly Fle&s;h, in one human Per&s;on:&mdash; as al&s;o to admire the infinite <HI>Conde&s;cen&s;ion</HI> of God in admitting an embody'd Spirit to the Pri|vileges of his &s;acred Pre&s;ence and Communion, while he had Thou&s;ands of <HI>Angels</HI> to mini&s;ter about his Throne above, nor &s;tood in any Need of the &s;ublime&s;t Homages and Honours of his mo&s;t exalted Creatures, much le&s;s of the mean Services of <HI>Man</HI> upon his Foot&s;tool here below. &mdash; And when we reflect, that Man (as to his vi&s;ible Part) was <HI>formed out of Clay,</HI> that <HI>the fir&s;t Man was of the Earth earthy,</HI> and that <HI>we have born the Image of the Earthy,</HI> this &s;hould mortify the <HI>Pride of Life,</HI> humble us by a Sen&s;e of our mean Original, and make us afraid to <HI>&s;trive with our Maker,</HI> or to exalt our&s;elves in the Vanity of our Mind above our <HI>Fellow-Creatures.</HI> &mdash; This &s;hould teach us, not to over-rate our <HI>bodily</HI> Part, but to prefer our <HI>&s;piritual</HI> and <HI>immortal,</HI> in all our Care and Provi&s;ion for our &s;elves. &mdash; And may not this admi|ni&s;ter &s;ome Encouragement to us (at lea&s;t to the People of God) to hope for divine <HI>Compa&s;&s;ion</HI> towards us? For he <HI>remembreth that he hath made us as the Clay,</HI> he <HI>knoweth our Frame,</HI> and <HI>remembreth that we are but Du&s;t.</HI> &mdash; However, let all our Complaints be for ever &s;ilenced by the Sovereignty of God that made us; and let none murmur, that they are of <HI>them who dwell in Hou&s;es of Clay, who&s;e Foundation is in the Du&s;t;</HI> nor even that they are put to &s;uffer grievous Things in the Body. <HI>Wo unto him, that &s;aith to his Father, What begotte&s;t thou?

<P>Let it now be ob&s;erv'd,</P>
<P>When it's remembred how the <HI>Soul</HI> of Man was at fir&s;t made in the <HI>Image of God,</HI> this Reflection al&s;o may be apply'd to many profitable <HI>U&s;es</HI> in Religion, and &s;hould con&s;tantly be directed to its ju&s;t <HI>practical</HI> Ends.</P>
<P>Thus, it &s;hould lead us to review and admire the <HI>Perfections</HI> of God, his Sanctity and Skill and Power and Goodne&s;s, di&s;|play'd in <HI>forming the Spirit of Man within him;</HI> an intelligent, active, holy and unblemi&s;h'd Spirit, as it was when it came fir&s;t out of his creating Hand.

Thus, <HI>Man</HI> was at fir&s;t a little <HI>Image</HI> of God in the World, &s;hining with all the Glories of intellectual and moral Perfection, compatible to human Nature in its probationary State, and with the Honours of Sovereignty over all other &s;ublunary Creatures. With what Gratitude and Prai&s;e &s;hould we always remember the Goodne&s;s of God our Maker, in all this!</P>
<P>Yet at the &s;ame Time, with what Tears of bitter Grief and Confu&s;ion of Face ought we again to reflect on the unhappy <HI>Fall</HI> of our fir&s;t Parents, and mourn the fir&s;t Rebellion, as a Di&s;honour to God, a Reproach and Ruin to them&s;elves, and fatal to their Po&s;terity, in &s;piritual and moral Regards e&s;pecially!</P>
<P>However, we &s;hould take a thankful Notice of God's &s;paring Goodne&s;s, in that there are &s;till &s;ome <HI>Remains,</HI> in the Soul of Man, of <HI>the Similitude of God,</HI> in natural Re&s;pects, I mean, in Regard of natural Rea&s;on, and natural Con&s;cience; which pre|&s;erves a Di&s;tinction between the human and brutal Kinds, and lays the Foundation for a Po&s;&s;ibility of our Recovery, makes us (tho' fallen Creatures) &s;till capable Subjects of moral Govern|ment, and by the Influence of divine Re&s;traints &s;till capable, in &s;ome Mea&s;ure, to pur&s;ue the Ends and enjoy the Good of Society.</P>
<P>Hence, in Conformity to the Precepts of Scripture, as well as Rea&s;on, we &s;hould learn, <HI>not to de&s;pi&s;e</HI> human Nature, even under its mo&s;t uncomely Forms, but to <HI>honour all Men,</HI> tho' in the mo&s;t &s;ervile and abject Condition, as excelling the Brutal

<P>Should we not al&s;o be convinced by the Reflection before us, that the great God, the <HI>Former of Spirits,</HI> is the &s;upreme <HI>Happine&s;s</HI> of Man, and the only Object of our religious <HI>Wor&s;hip?</HI> And &s;hould it not teach us the ab&s;olute <HI>Rea&s;onablene&s;s</HI> of all that <HI>Duty</HI> which God requires of Man, to reflect, that we are <HI>his Creatures,</HI> and as made at fir&s;t in his <HI>Image,</HI> had originally &s;ufficient <HI>Power</HI> per|fectly to obey his Will? &mdash; But, on the other Hand, &s;hould not this Reflection &s;erve to convince us of the utter Unrea&s;onablene&s;s and Ba&s;ene&s;s of <HI>Sin,</HI> in all its Kinds and in every In&s;tance and Degree?

<P>Thus, God's forming the Garden of <HI>Eden</HI> for our fir&s;t Father, and <HI>putting him into it,</HI> a Place abounding with all terrene Riches, Beauties, and Delights, perfectly &s;uited to all the regular Propen|&s;ities of animal Nature, and undoubtedly adju&s;ted to the &s;upe|rior Purpo&s;es of divine Contemplation and &s;piritual Devotion (perhaps &s;acred to the peculiar U&s;es of a holy <HI>Temple,</HI> and exhi|biting a mo&s;t lively emblematical Idea of the heavenly <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI>) as al&s;o God's planting therein, amid&s;t other Trees mo&s;t beauti|ful to the Eye and good for Food, that &s;ingularly excellent one, the <HI>Tree of Life,</HI> which be&s;ides it's beneficial and lovely natural Properties, &s;eems to have been de&s;tin'd to a <HI>Sacramental</HI> U&s;e, to be a Seal of the Covenant made with <HI>Adam,</HI> and a Pledge of his Reward in Ca&s;e of Obedience, having this In&s;cription upon it, <HI>Eat and Live;</HI> our <HI>Remembrance</HI> of the&s;e Things furni&s;hes us with Matter of <HI>Prai&s;e</HI> and <HI>Thank&s;giving</HI> to God, for his pri|mitive Goodne&s;s to Man, in this di&s;tingui&s;hing Provi&s;ion for his Comfort and Well-being, both in Soul &amp; Body.

<P>But to proceed unto another Fact,</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="005947_0022_102727E820A0D050">God's in&s;tituting a <HI>Sabbath</HI> for Man, immediately on his Creation (as it's commonly judg'd) and before his Fall, is a fur|ther Demon&s;tration of divine Goodne&s;s, Holine&s;s, Wi&s;dom, and Sovereignty, which &s;hould be <HI>remembred</HI> by us with Gratitude and Prai&s;e, and with due practical Acknowledgements. God having fini&s;hed the Work of Creation in the &s;pace of &s;ix Days, <HI>re&s;ted on the &s;eventh Day;</HI> wherefore the Lord <HI>ble&s;&s;ed the Sabbath-Day, and hallowed it.</HI> This Reflection &s;hould teach us to honour the <HI>Sabbath,</HI> for its venerable Antiquity, its divine Authority, and the Stamp of Holine&s;s from the Beginning put upon it. We &s;hould celebrate the <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> of God, in appointing &s;o fit a Me|morial of the World's Creation, and in appropriating to his own immediate Service &s;o fit a Proportion of the Life of Man. We &s;hould &s;ee in this In&s;titution an early and la&s;ting Te&s;timony of God's <HI>Sovereignty</HI> over Man; and withal, of his <HI>Goodne&s;s</HI> to him. <HI>The Sabbath was made for Man,</HI> to be a Day of &s;pecial Com|munion with God in this World, and a Pledge of ever|la&s;ting Re&s;t in God, in the World to come. We &s;hould admire the Grace of God in continuing to Man the Privilege of a <HI>Sabbath,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the Forfeiture of it by his Fall. We &s;hould give our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> the Glory of having purchas'd this Privilege for his People; and as <HI>He</HI> has claim'd to be <HI>Lord al&s;o of the Sabbath,</HI> we &s;hould acknowledge Him in this his di|vine Character, by <HI>remembring the Sabbath-Day, to keep it holy</HI> to his Honour; looking to him for the Sabbath-Ble&s;&s;ing, and per|forming Sabbath-Duty in his Name; Commemorating as well the <HI>new</HI> Creation, as the <HI>old,</HI> and <HI>honouring the Son, even as we honour the Father.</HI>&mdash; A <HI>&s;eventh Part</HI> of Time has been &s;acred to God, for a <HI>Sabbath,</HI> by his own In&s;titution, from the Founda|tion of the World: and &s;ince Chri&s;t's Re&s;urrection, the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Day of the Week (being that on which he ro&s;e) worthily &s;u&s;tains the Honour of being <HI>the Lord's Day,</HI> &s;acred to the Memory of a <HI>ri&s;en</HI> JESUS, the <HI>Lord of Glory,</HI> our Creator and our Redeemer.</P>
<P>Another Fact, which &s;hews God's Kindne&s;s to <HI>Adam</HI> in his Paradi&s;iacal State, and which we &s;hould <HI>remember,</HI> is the provid|ing and be&s;towing upon him a fit <HI>Companion.</HI> God &s;aid, <HI>It is not good, that the Man &s;hould be alone:</HI> and therefore he prepared <HI>an Help meet for him,</HI> by his own creating Hand made he a <HI>Woman, brought her to the Man,</HI> &amp;c. &mdash; While we remember this admi|rable Occurrence, we &s;hould in general learn from it to con&s;ider our &s;elves as <HI>conver&s;able</HI> Creatures, form'd for amicable and u&s;eful

<HI>Society,</HI> &mdash; not to herd di&s;honourably with the <HI>Bea&s;ts</HI> of the Earth (as the Manner of &s;ome is) but as the moral Fitne&s;s and Rea&s;on of Things in&s;truct us, to a&s;&s;ociate with tho&s;e of our own &s;uperior Species: And this teaches us, that we ought by all pro|per Ways to cultivate human Friend&s;hips and Alliances, to value and promote e&s;pecially the Communion of Saints, to be <HI>&s;erving one another in Love,</HI> and <HI>&s;erving our Generation according to the Will of God,</HI> in the uniform Practice of every &s;ocial and relative Duty. &mdash; In particular, As the <HI>Family</HI> was the fir&s;t Society, and is that little Community we are all fir&s;t initiated into, and mo&s;t conver&s;ant in, it &s;hould be our early and abiding Care to exer|ci&s;e our &s;elves in <HI>Family-Duty,</HI> of every Kind &s;uitable to the Re|lations we &s;u&s;tain, and to practi&s;e all the important Virtues of Dome&s;tick Life.&mdash; As the Relation of <HI>Hu&s;band</HI> and <HI>Wife</HI> was in&s;tituted with a View to their being mutual <HI>Helps,</HI> even in the State of primitive Perfection, all &s;hould con&s;ider this as one va|luable <HI>End</HI> of the conjugal Relation, directing their Choice of a Companion by it, and adju&s;ting their Conduct in the Relation, to this excellent De&s;ign; ever &s;olicitous to approve them|&s;elves <HI>Helps meet</HI> for each other.

<P>Here the mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing Scenes open to our View; the rich|e&s;t, the &s;weete&s;t, and mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Themes of Meditation offer to our Thoughts. <HI>I&s;rael's</HI> Redemption out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> that Work of Wonder, was but a Metaphor and Shadow to this &s;piritual and eternal Redemption, which I now &s;peak of. Nay, on a Variety of Accounts, this &s;urpa&s;&s;es in Glory the Work of <HI>Creation</HI> it &s;elf.

A Work it is, of the noble&s;t Kind, and mo&s;t my&s;terious Nature, of the highe&s;t Account with God, and the la&s;t Importance to Man; what <HI>Angels de&s;ire to look into,</HI> and what demands <HI>our</HI> mo&s;t attentive Notice, con&s;tant Inquiry, and clo&s;e&s;t Application of Thought, as the main Subject of Divine Revelation, and the grand Ba&s;is of all the Tran&s;actions of Divine Mercy, the nece&s;&s;ary Spring of a rational Hope to the fallen Crea|ture, and the primary Source of all our Religion and all our Hap|pine&s;s. Accordingly the in&s;pir'd Scriptures frequently cele|brate <HI>the acceptable Year of the Lord, the Year of his Redeemed,</HI> and teach us to regard this as in a tran&s;cendent Sen&s;e <HI>the Year of the Right Hand of the mo&s;t High.</HI> Be&s;ure in this ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Year</HI> are to be &s;een the mo&s;t illu&s;trious Di&s;coveries of <HI>his eternal Power</HI> and <HI>Godhead,</HI> the brighte&s;t Characters of Divine Sovereignty, Strength, Wi&s;dom, Ju&s;tice, Holine&s;s, and Truth, with an infinite Profu&s;ion of Goodne&s;s and Mercy.</P>
<P>This wonderful <HI>Year,</HI> in it's large&s;t Con&s;ideration, may be &s;aid to know <HI>no End</HI> nor <HI>Beginning</HI> of Days.

<P>Now, to make &s;ome <HI>Reflections</HI> and <HI>Inferences</HI> very briefly, let it be &s;aid, &mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. We &s;hould con&s;ider the di&s;tingui&s;hing <HI>Obligations</HI> we are under, in Point of Gratitude, to the ble&s;&s;ed God, who has <HI>revealed the&s;e Things to Babes,</HI> when they are <HI>hid from many Wi&s;e and Pru|dent</HI> and <HI>Great</HI> in the Earth; and has given us &s;o many precious <HI>Helps</HI> for the <HI>remembring</HI> of Chri&s;t and the Things of Chri&s;t, while Thou&s;ands in the World are &s;itting in the <HI>Shadow of Death,</HI> igno|rant of the Saviour and eternal Salvation. &mdash; We &s;hould e&s;teem it a glorious Advantage, a ble&s;&s;ed Privilege, that we enjoy, in the <HI>Word written,</HI> where <HI>the Things of our Peace</HI> are di&s;cover'd, and
<PB N="39" REF="005947_0041_10272820B6AFE890">
the <HI>Memoirs</HI> of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> the Redeemer (the mo&s;t excellent, the mo&s;t important what&s;oever) are pre&s;erv'd; and which we have in our own Hands, in our own Language, to be our daily Coun&s;eller, and as a Light to our Path, as a Lamp to our Feet, to guide us in the Way of Peace. &mdash; It is an additional Privilege we enjoy, in the <HI>Word preached;</HI> which rehear&s;es to us the Go&s;pel-Hi&s;tory &amp; Doc|trine of Chri&s;t, from time to time, in&s;tructs us in the Knowledge of the Divine Records, and a&s;&s;i&s;ts us in remembring tho&s;e impor|tant Facts and Events, in which the Salvation of the Soul is &s;o nearly concern'd. &mdash; We have further Helps in the <HI>Sabbath,</HI> the <HI>Sacraments,</HI> the <HI>Example</HI> of Saints, the <HI>Coun&s;els</HI> and <HI>Reproofs</HI> of chri&s;tian Monitors, and other Means (withal likewi&s;e the con|current Aids of God's <HI>Spirit</HI>) conducing to promote our Acquain|tance with Chri&s;t, &amp; Remembrance of him; nor only &s;erving to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Under&s;tanding &amp; Memory, but likewi&s;e to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Con&s;|cience &amp; Affections in their re&s;pective Offices, &amp; to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in Point of Devotion &amp; Practice. O how thankful &s;hould we be for &s;uch &s;ignal Advantages and Helps in this momentous Ca&s;e? Happy we, if we improve the <HI>Talents</HI> committed to our Tru&s;t. &mdash; But indeed, if we are <HI>&s;lothful Servants,</HI> if we are <HI>evil</HI> and <HI>unthankful,</HI> and found finally Strangers to a true <HI>Remembrance</HI> of the Redeemer, how aggravated will be our Guilt and Condemnation!

<P N="2">2. We &s;hould therefore &s;olemnly and impartially <HI>examine</HI> into our Ca&s;e, into our Experience, our Temper and Management; and inquire whether we have ever yet been bro't by the Grace of God to <HI>remember</HI> Chri&s;t and Redemption, as we ought. &mdash; Do we in our deliberate Judgment <HI>value</HI> the Memory of Chri&s;t and his redeeming Love; <HI>accounting all Things but Lo&s;s for the Excel|lency of the Knowledge of Chri&s;t Je&s;us our Lord,</HI> and looking upon them as comparatively not worth our <HI>remembring?</HI> Are we firm|ly <HI>per&s;uaded</HI> of the glorious Realities in the Go&s;pel-Report? And are we labouring for an increa&s;ed Acquaintance with the <HI>Theory</HI> of Divine Truths referring to Chri&s;t and Redemption? Do we <HI>inure</HI> our&s;elves to the Contemplation, and <HI>delight</HI> in the notional Study of the&s;e Things?

And have we ever felt Impre&s;&s;ions on our <HI>Hearts</HI> &amp; <HI>Con&s;ciences,</HI> an&s;werable to the Nature and Moment of the&s;e Divine Subjects? In brief, do we labour to apply what Knowledge and Sen&s;e we have of the&s;e Things to all their genuine

<P>But thus much for the fir&s;t great and comprehen&s;ive Article of Wonder in the <HI>Year of Redemption.</HI> &mdash;And <HI>the &s;econd is like unto it;</HI> which yet I mu&s;t more briefly con&s;ider.</P>
<P N="2">[2.] Another great and memorable Wonder in the <HI>Redemp|tion-Year of the Right Hand of the mo&s;t High,</HI> is the <HI>Application</HI> or actual Be&s;towment of the <HI>Salvation which is by Chri&s;t Je&s;us;</HI> comprehending the Mi&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> the Light of <HI>Chri&s;|tian Revelation,</HI> and Privileges of the Evangelical <HI>Church-State,</HI> the <HI>Succe&s;s</HI> of Go&s;pel-Means, and the Communication of all <HI>&s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings</HI> in this World, follow'd with <HI>compleat eternal</HI> Happine&s;s in the World to come.</P>
<P N="1">1. By the <HI>Application</HI> of Redemption is to be under&s;tood, in ge|neral, according to the Repre&s;entation of it in Scripture, our being made <HI>Partakers of Chri&s;t,</HI> and brought into the <HI>Fellow&s;hip of the Son of God.</HI> It implies our having the vital Principle of <HI>Faith</HI> planted in us, and being thereby <HI>united to Chri&s;t,</HI> in <HI>effectual Calling:</HI> wherein the Spirit of God, convincing us of our Sin and Mi&s;ery, enlightning our Minds in the Knowledge of Chri&s;t, and renewing our Wills, doth per&s;uade and enable us to embrace Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as he is exhibited to us in the Go&s;pel. &mdash; Particularly we thro'
<PB N="49" REF="005947_0051_1027283C92CFDB60">
Faith <HI>receive the Atonement,</HI> and have <HI>God imputing to us Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s without Works, ju&s;tifying us freely by his Grace;</HI> at the &s;ame Time al&s;o <HI>purifying our Hearts by Faith:</HI> And <HI>to as many as receive Chri&s;t, to them He giveth Power to become the Children of God;</HI> and <HI>if Children then Heirs, Heirs of God and Joint-Heirs with Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> God becometh <HI>their God</HI> in Chri&s;t, and takes them for <HI>his People.</HI> So <HI>the Ble&s;&s;ing of</HI> Abraham <HI>comes upon them thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> They <HI>receive the End of their Faith, the Salvation of their Souls.</HI> They &s;hare in the Purcha&s;es of the meritorious Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, the Acqui&s;itions of his victorious Re&s;urrection and trium|phant A&s;cen&s;ion, the Procurements of his ever-prevalent Inter|ce&s;&s;ion, and the Donations of his Royal Power and Grace. God <HI>crowneth them with Loving-kindne&s;s,</HI> in the Life which now is, but mo&s;t eminently in the Life which is to come. For the Work of <HI>Application,</HI> tho' begun and carry'd on here, is not perfected till hereafter.</P>
<P N="2">2. A Work this is of equal <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> as that of Impetration. Our Lord <HI>Je&s;us</HI> de&s;ign'd his Humiliation and Exaltation to be &s;ub&s;ervient to this ultimate End of his Mediation. This is a ne|ce&s;&s;ary Evidence of the Validity of his Sacrifice, and the Efficacy of his Interce&s;&s;ion. Indeed without this, the <HI>Grace of God</HI> would be <HI>fru&s;trated,</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> dead <HI>in vain.</HI> The <HI>Purcha&s;e</HI> of Redemp|tion would become of <HI>none Effect</HI> to us, without the <HI>Application</HI> of it. The Glory of God and the Lamb is connected with this, and the whole Happine&s;s of his People is immediately founded in it. It is therefore a Work of the la&s;t Importance.</P>
<P N="3">3. It's a Work full of <HI>Difficulty,</HI> in&s;uperable to all meer created Power and Skill: Nothing &s;hort of a Divine Agent is equal to this arduous Affair.

<P>Sure I am, 'tis a wondrous and memorable <HI>Year of Vi&s;itation,</HI> this, wherein <HI>God hath vi&s;ited the</HI> Gentiles, <HI>to take out of them a People for his Name;</HI> hath vi&s;ited a dark and benighted World, that lay in Wickedne&s;s, with <HI>the Day-&s;pring from on high,</HI> with the <HI>Light of the glorious Go&s;pel of the ble&s;&s;ed God,</HI> the <HI>Revelation</HI> of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> diffu&s;ing the <HI>Knowledge of Salvation</HI> thro' his Name far and wide, and &s;etting up his vi&s;ible <HI>Kingdom</HI> among Men, even among <HI>all Nations:</HI> nor only &s;ending forth his <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> to preach unto every Creature under Heaven, and di&s;pen&s;e the Ordinances, which He had appointed for Means of Grace, but al&s;o &s;ending forth the <HI>Spirit of Grace,</HI> to accompany his Word and In&s;titutions with enlightning and quickning <HI>Influences,</HI> to put <HI>Power</HI> into them, and give them <HI>Succe&s;s;</HI> and thus to <HI>win</HI> Souls to Chri&s;t, place them in <HI>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion</HI> of purcha&s;ed Salvation, and bring them to Life ever|la&s;ting. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord God of I&s;rael; for He hath vi&s;ited and redeemed his People.</HI> He hath <HI>redeemed</HI> them in the Way of <HI>Ap|plication,</HI> as well as Purcha&s;e; and to that End, hath <HI>vi&s;ited</HI> them

by his <HI>Spirit,</HI> as well as by his Son. He hath <HI>vi&s;ited</HI> them by the Go&s;pel, and the Mini&s;try of the Word, which reports the Savi|our, and &s;hews Men the Way of Salvation: but that were to little Purpo&s;e, had He not al&s;o <HI>vi&s;ited</HI> them by the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> &s;ent down from Heaven, in the Capacities of a Teacher, Sanctifier, and Comforter, to pre&s;ide over the <HI>Church,</HI> the <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> and <HI>Means</HI> of Salvation, and as &s;upreme Agent for the Son of God to impart the Benefits of Redemption to his People. And with a &s;overeign Liberty He communicates the &s;ame; <HI>dividing to every Man &s;everally as He will:</HI> Yet proportioning and timing his Di&s;tributions with an un&s;potted Rectitude and unerring Wi&s;dom; ever adju&s;ting the whole Admini&s;tration of his ble&s;&s;ed Office to the Plan of Redemption, and Scheme of the Go&s;pel, and by Con|&s;equence in a Sub&s;erviency to the Ends of the <HI>Redeemer's</HI> Honour and Intere&s;t, and the <HI>Redeemed's</HI> Safety and Happine&s;s. O if we <HI>knew the Gift of God,</HI> and <HI>knew our &s;elves,</HI> we &s;hould at once &s;ee the Nece&s;&s;ity, the Excellency, and Advantage of the <HI>Spirit's</HI> Mi|ni&s;tration! He is an omnipre&s;ent, omni&s;cient, infinitely wi&s;e and powerful Agent, and perfectly benign, and faithful, holy, and true. His gracious Pre&s;ence is the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, vital, and fun|damental Good. The riche&s;t and happie&s;t Effects re&s;ult from it, in Proportion to the Degree of it's Enjoyment. Where He &s;u&s;|pends the Activity and Influence of his Pre&s;ence, there is all Weakne&s;s, and Darkne&s;s, and Deadne&s;s, in the Souls of Men, and in the be&s;t of Means and In&s;truments: But where He di|vinely exerts the Powers of his Office and the Perfections of his Nature, there is a proportionable Strength, Light, and Life. He can &s;urmount the &s;tronge&s;t Oppo&s;ition from Men or Devils; He can do all his Plea&s;ure without Controul. But in the Admini&s;tration of his Office He exerci&s;es an <HI>ordinate Power,</HI> regulated and limited by the Coun&s;el of his own Will: hence, when harden'd Rebels do always <HI>re&s;i&s;t</HI> and <HI>grieve</HI> the Holy Spirit, He righteou&s;ly with|draws his forfeited Pre&s;ence, and gives them up into the Hand of their own Coun&s;el. &mdash; However, he <HI>abides</HI> with the Church of God <HI>for ever;</HI> and has been always <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> with his faithful Mini&s;ters &amp; People, with his own Word &amp; Ordinances, from Age to Age, tho' in divers Manners and in various Mea&s;ures. &mdash; As the grand De&s;ign of his Mi&s;&s;ion is to <HI>glorify Chri&s;t,</HI> &s;o &s;ince the A&s;cen&s;ion of our Lord <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> the <HI>Manife&s;tation of the Spriit</HI> has been afforded more exten&s;ively and more abundantly.

<P>In this Regard, it was emphatically <HI>the Year of the Right Hand of the mo&s;t High,</HI> in the <HI>Beginning</HI> of this la&s;t and mo&s;t perfect Di&s;pen&s;ation, in the Times e&s;pecially of the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> of our Lord. They were them&s;elves <HI>burning and &s;hining Lights,</HI> and in a &s;ingu|lar Manner <HI>endued with Power from on High;</HI> the <HI>Spirit of Glory and of God</HI> re&s;ting upon them in the large&s;t Mea&s;ures: and they had a &s;urpri&s;ing <HI>Succe&s;s</HI> attending their Labours in the Go&s;pel, <HI>thro' the Power of the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> which <HI>went with their Word.</HI> In&s;omuch that the Apo&s;tle writes in that Language, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.14. <HI>Now Thanks be unto God, who always cau&s;eth us to triumph in Chri&s;t, and maketh manife&s;t the Savour of his Knowledge by us in every Place.</HI> In that Day the <HI>Labourers</HI> were numerous, and the <HI>Harve&s;t plente|ous.</HI> A <HI>great Door and effectual was opened,</HI> tho' there were many Adver&s;aries. Then the <HI>Kingdom of God</HI> came, not in Word only, but in <HI>Power,</HI> and in the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> It was a mo&s;t remarkable Time of general Awaknings; and tho' there were <HI>Counterfeit Profe&s;&s;ors</HI> then, as in every Age, and not a few In&s;tances of <HI>Apo&s;|tacy,</HI> yet &s;ound <HI>Conver&s;ions</HI> were uncommonly multiply'd, and the <HI>Souls of the Di&s;ciples</HI> eminently <HI>confirmed,</HI> and <HI>built up on their mo&s;t holy Faith.</HI> The Word of the Lord <HI>Je&s;us</HI> prevailed, &amp; grew migh|tily. Multitudes of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and even of their <HI>Prie&s;ts,</HI> became obedient to the Faith. <HI>Thou&s;ands</HI> were added to the Lord in <HI>one Day:</HI> and the Partition-Wall being broken down, which had &s;o long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between <HI>Jew</HI> and <HI>Gentile,</HI> the Word of Salvation was carry'd into the <HI>Heathen</HI> World; <HI>Idols</HI> were &s;een falling every where before the preached Go&s;pel, their <HI>Temples</HI> quickly demo|li&s;h'd, the Empire of <HI>Satan</HI> in a Manner de&s;troy'd, &amp; the King|dom of God our Saviour &s;et up, on the Ruins of the Devil's King|dom. Then was Chri&s;t <HI>ju&s;tified in the Spirit, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the World;</HI> the Religion of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> trium|phant over all Oppo&s;ition, the Churches multiply'd and in a flou|ri&s;hing State, the Mini&s;try magnify'd and had in Reputation, adorn'd with eminent Gifts and Graces, and honour'd with glori|ous Tokens of our Lord's promis'd Pre&s;ence. The <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> was &s;hed forth <HI>abundantly</HI> on that Generation, thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t.&mdash; This is but an imperfect Account of the <HI>Apo&s;tolick</HI> Age, agreable to the Current of the &s;acred Story. Now <HI>the&s;e Things were writ|ten

for our Learning, upon whom the Ends of the World are come;</HI> that thro' Comfort of the Scriptures we might have <HI>Hope towards God,</HI> and might <HI>pray in Faith</HI> for the Return of primitive and vital Chri&s;tianity, for renew'd Triumphs and an univer&s;al Spread of the glorious Go&s;pel. With this View, the&s;e <HI>ancient Things</HI> are to be recollected by us: and tho&s;e <HI>Years of the Right Hand of the mo&s;t High</HI> often to be reflected on, that we may give God the Glory due to his great Name, for the Wonders of his Power and Grace in the Days of old.</P>
<P>Nor were the <HI>&s;ucceding</HI> Ages of the primitive Church left without the <HI>Fruit of the Spirit,</HI> and &s;ome &s;ignal Tokens of the <HI>Power of the Highe&s;t</HI> pre&s;ent with the Mini&s;ters of the Word, and with the Churches of Chri&s;t, in one Place and another. &mdash; But indeed (the Reflection is melancholy) there was a gradual Dying of Religion, and a partial Withdraw of the Spirit of Grace; un|til at length, in Place of the Temple of the living God, <HI>Satan</HI> obtained to have his Seat, <HI>Iniquity</HI> no longer hid it's Head, but regain'd much of it's old Empire, and the <HI>Man of Sin,</HI> that Son of Perdition, for Ages u&s;urp'd the Throne of Chri&s;t in the vi&s;ible Church; &s;aving among a Few: for &s;till all along God re&s;erv'd to him&s;elf a <HI>Remnant</HI> of &s;uch as bow'd not the Knee to <HI>Baal.</HI></P>
<P>But there has been a glorious Return and evident Pre&s;ence of the <HI>Spirit</HI> of Chri&s;t in the&s;e <HI>later</HI> Generations of his People. A &s;ignal <HI>Year of the Right Hand of the mo&s;t High</HI> it was, when the <HI>Man of Sin</HI> began to fall before the <HI>Sword of the Spirit;</HI> I mean, when the <HI>Papal</HI> Intere&s;t about two Centuries &s;ince receiv'd a fatal Shock, by the Re&s;urrection of a long-bury'd Go&s;pel, in &s;un|dry Parts of the World, and &s;o many <HI>Nations,</HI> at the Reformation from Popery, were <HI>&s;prinkled</HI> from on high by the Bapti&s;m of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> yea, <HI>Floods</HI> &s;eem'd poured on the dry Ground; at a Time while &s;ome few righteous Souls, that had been groaning under the Tyranny of <HI>Antichri&s;t</HI> and lamenting after the Lord, were ready to &s;ay, <HI>Now behold, if the Lord would open Windows in Heaven, might &s;uch a Thing be!</HI> Yet the marvellous Event was &s;een, to the Glory of &s;overeign Grace in Chri&s;t. Here was now a &s;urpri&s;ing Revival of primitive Chri&s;tanity. This was a ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Re&s;toration</HI> indeed, worthy of an annual &amp; perpetual <HI>Remembrance.</HI> And the Memory of this happy <HI>Year of the Lord</HI> &s;hould, under the pre&s;ent awful Decline of the <HI>Reformed Religion,</HI> encourage our Faith in God for the <HI>Revival</HI> of this langui&s;hing Intere&s;t among the Nations.</P>

<P>I can't but think (to come nigher home) that there was an uncommon <HI>Pre&s;ence</HI> of God by his Holy <HI>Spirit,</HI> as well as Provi|dence, with our excellent <HI>Progenitors,</HI> the original Settlers of <HI>New-England.</HI> We have Rea&s;on to believe, a great Part (if not the Generality) of the fir&s;t Planters of the&s;e Colonies were happy In|&s;tances of the <HI>Application</HI> of Redemption in effectual Calling, and experienc'd much of the Spirit of Grace, in his &s;anctifying, teach|ing, quickning, and comforting Influences. In that Day, the <HI>Word</HI> had <HI>free Cour&s;e</HI> and was <HI>glorify'd</HI> among them: God was very remarkably &s;een <HI>in his Power and Glory</HI> in the Sanctuary: <HI>His Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> was upon his People: <HI>His Work</HI> appear'd unto his Servants, and <HI>his Glory</HI> unto their Children.

<P>Nor may we <HI>de&s;pi&s;e the</HI> pre&s;ent <HI>Day of &s;mall Things</HI> with the Saints, in this their militant State (imperfect as indeed it is, in a comparative View) but looking forward to the <HI>la&s;t Re&s;ult</HI> of Things, when all their Gifts, Graces, Ble&s;&s;ings, and Con&s;olations &s;hall be advanc'd to their intended <HI>Perfection,</HI> the Pro&s;pect of this &s;hould exalt our Idea's of the <HI>Glory</HI> of the <HI>Spirit's Mini&s;tration,</HI> &amp; &s;trongly commend his Work in the <HI>Application</HI> of Redemption to our fre|quent and devout <HI>Remembrance.</HI> &mdash; In the mean time let the <HI>Spi|rite in Paradi&s;e</HI> &s;peak the Prai&s;es of this Divine Agent, and mag|nify his Work, tell the Joy of God's Salvation, and declare what is the Hope of his Calling, what the Riches of the Glory of his Inheritance in the Saints: and let their noble <HI>Pattern,</HI> who are perpetually chanting forth their joyful Anthems in Celebration of the Sanctifier, equally as of the Redeemer, attract our Imita|tion. &mdash; Or, as Contraries plac'd in a comparative Light, &s;erve to illu&s;trate one another, let the Horrors of <HI>Hell</HI> demon&s;trate to us the Happine&s;s of Heaven; let the <HI>Spirits in Pri&s;on,</HI> by the Angui&s;hes of De&s;pair, proclaim the infinite Value of <HI>Chri&s;t in us the Hope of Glory.</HI> &mdash; Nay, let the <HI>Spirits in Fle&s;h,</HI> that have felt

We &s;hould <HI>ob&s;erve the&s;e Things,</HI> in reading the Apo&s;tles and Evangeli&s;ts; and often review the &s;acred Story, to entertain and affect our &s;elves with the glorious <HI>Memoirs</HI> they have left us of the <HI>Mini&s;tration of the Spirit,</HI> which were written for our Information and U&s;e. And if in <HI>other</HI> Writings, tho' but of meer human Original, or if in cre|dible Report, we meet with Accounts of the <HI>like A&s;pect,</HI> the&s;e al&s;o (in Proportion to the Motives of Credibility accompanying them) we &s;hould readily receive, and think &s;uch valuable Hi&s;tory de&s;erving our Notice and Remembrance. Or indeed if In&s;tances of the Work of the <HI>spirit</HI> fall within our own <HI>Ob&s;ervation</HI> (much more if <HI>we</HI> our &s;elves are happy Examples of it) we &s;hould <HI>regard the Works of his Hands,</HI> trea&s;ure up in our Memory &s;uch wonder|ful Events, and often employ our Mind in &s;uitable Reflections upon them.</P>
<P>But here, as in the Ca&s;e of other <HI>the Works of the Right Hand of the mo&s;t High,</HI> we mu&s;t take Heed, that we don't content our &s;elves with a mere <HI>hi&s;torical,</HI> and <HI>&s;uperficial, heartle&s;s</HI> Commemo|ration: but ever look that our <HI>Remembrance</HI> of the&s;e high and &s;acred Events be attemper'd to the <HI>Nature</HI> &amp; <HI>Importance</HI> of them, and apply'd to <HI>experimental, devotional,</HI> and <HI>practical</HI> Purpo&s;es in Religion. I might now di&s;tinctly &s;tate the Qualifications of a due <HI>Remembrance</HI> in this Ca&s;e, and &s;ay, it &s;hou'd be &mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. With <HI>A&s;&s;ent</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ua&s;ion.</HI> &mdash; None may &s;uppo&s;e it a Fa|ble, a Fancy, or Fiction, but it &s;hould be admitted for unque&s;ti|onable Fact and Reality, <HI>that there is a Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> His Exi&s;tence and Per&s;onality, as one of <HI>the Three that bear Record in Heaven;</HI> his Character and Office as the <HI>Paraclete,</HI> the Comforter or Ad|vocate; his actual Mi&s;&s;ion, and divine Operations, as reported to us in the Scripture-Records; the&s;e are infallible Truths, to be

a&s;&s;ented to on the Te&s;timony of God in his Word. And as there are A&s;&s;urances given by our Lord, that the <HI>Comforter</HI> &s;hall <HI>abide</HI> with his People for <HI>ever;</HI> this affords &s;ufficient Ground for a rational Belief of the <HI>Spirit's</HI> uncea&s;ing Pre&s;ence with the Churches of the Saints. Why then &s;hould it be tho't incredible, that God has been wont to <HI>pour the Spirit from on High,</HI> tho' in varying Degrees, from Age to Age? Or why &s;hould we be &s;low of Heart to believe the Di&s;plays of his Grace in our own Times?</P>
<P N="2">2. With <HI>Study</HI> and <HI>Meditation.</HI> &mdash; Not only the Dignity of the Agent, but the Weight and Excellency of the Work, as it is mo&s;t honorary to God and beneficial to Man, and the Depth of Wi&s;dom and My&s;tery in the Nature, Manner and Method, as well as Foundation of it, are Con&s;iderations, that con&s;pire to &s;hew it equally de&s;erving and requiring our clo&s;e&s;t Attention and de|liberate &s;olemn Contemplation.

<P N="3">3. With <HI>Approbation</HI> and <HI>Wonder.</HI> &mdash; The Office of the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> is glorious in the Eyes of God and the Lamb: and his Performan|ces therein mo&s;t plea&s;ing to Heaven. The Work of the <HI>Sancti|fier,</HI> even as that of the Redeemer, is the Admiration of inquiring Angels and reflecting Saints. In the &s;acred Writers we have e|minently a Pattern of our Duty, who every where celebrate the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> his Per&s;on, Office, and Work, in Terms of the highe&s;t Applau&s;e and Wonderment. Ours, like theirs, &s;hould be an approving and admiring, as well as a believing and contemplative Remembrance. We &s;hould be pleas'd with and admire the Work of Redemption, as in it's Purcha&s;e, &s;o in it's <HI>Application.</HI> We &s;hould admire this, as for it's divine Efficient, &s;o for it's my&s;te|rious and excellent Nature, and it's ble&s;&s;ed Fruits, for the Ho|nour redounding therefrom to God and the Mediator, and the Good accruing to Man; for the dignifying &amp; enriching Change wro't on it's happy Subjects, even in the Commencement of this Work, much more in it's final Completion. Surely the <HI>Spirit of Glory</HI> will at la&s;t be <HI>admir'd</HI> in his <HI>Temple,</HI> when he has put his fini&s;hing Hand to it.</P>
<P N="4">4. With <HI>Humility</HI> and <HI>Reverence.</HI> &mdash; When we contemplate the <HI>Things of the Spirit,</HI> we mu&s;t always be mindful that the&s;e are among the <HI>deep Things of God,</HI> which it becomes us ever to think and &s;peak of with a religious Awe and Solemnity on our Mind.

The <HI>Spirit's</HI> Breathings are liken'd to the <HI>Wind.</HI> (Joh. 3.8.)

<P N="6">6. With <HI>Affection</HI> and <HI>Complacence.</HI> &mdash;The Scriptures mention the <HI>Love of the Spirit,</HI> as the Duty and Property of the Believer; and recommend <HI>Joy in the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> as one of the Fruits of the <HI>Kingdom of God.</HI> Our Commemorations of the <HI>Spirit</HI> and the Wonders of his Admini&s;tration &s;hould be animated with <HI>Love,</HI> to his Divine Per&s;on, to his &s;acred Office, to the Subjects of his ble&s;&s;ed Work, and to the Means and In&s;truments He employs. And our Love mu&s;t operate by <HI>De&s;ire</HI> towards Him, by <HI>Delight</HI> in Him.

<P N="8">8. With <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Hope.</HI> &mdash; The Remembrance of what the <HI>Spirit of Holine&s;s</HI> hath been and done in his Office, &s;hould en|gage us to an Affiance in his Power and Grace for further Bene|fits to our &s;elves and others.

Former Expe|riences &s;hould encourage future Expectations. <HI>Is the Spirit of the Lord &s;traitned?</HI> Or are we &s;traitned in Him? No, but in our &s;elves.</P>
<P N="9">9. With <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Interce&s;&s;ion.</HI>&mdash; It mu&s;t be a <HI>prayerful</HI> Re|membrance. Even Believers need to pray for the Spirit.

keep up in out Mind a lively Sen&s;e of the holy <HI>Spirit,</HI> his Exi&s;tence, his Office, and Influence?</P>
<P>La&s;tly, With a corre&s;pondent <HI>Life</HI> and Cour&s;e of <HI>Action,</HI> re|&s;pecting both the inner and outer Man. &mdash; Our Remembrance of the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Spirit,</HI> his Office and Agency, which participates in the <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> of his Per&s;on, is never genuine and effectual, un|le&s;s we are bro't to re&s;emble Him in the moral Complexion of our whole Man, unle&s;s we are conform'd to Him in the Tempe|rature of our Hearts and in the Tenor of our Lives. But if having <HI>begun in the Spirit,</HI> we are <HI>walking after the Spirit, &s;owing to the Spi|rit, living according to God in the Spirit, thro' the Spirit mortifying the Deeds of the Body, purifying our Souls in obeying the Truth thro' the Spirit,</HI> in the Current of our Di&s;po&s;itions and Deportments <HI>led by the Spirit,</HI> and exhibiting the <HI>Fruit of the Spirit, in all Good|ne&s;s, Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and Truth;</HI> This is a true vital and practical <HI>remembring</HI> of the holy <HI>Spirit;</HI> this is to be our &s;elves the <HI>Monu|ments</HI> of his Office and <HI>Specimens</HI> of his Work, this is to <HI>repre&s;ent</HI> Him in his moral Perfections by the Image thereof in our &s;elves, and to <HI>honour</HI> Him in his Admini&s;tration by an active Homage and Conformity, which demon&s;trates our Faith a living Principle, and &s;hews our Religion to be of a Divine Texture. The&s;e practical Regards are a nece&s;&s;ary <HI>Evidence,</HI> that we are of tho&s;e to whom that noble Characteri&s;tick belongs (<HI>Rom.</HI> 8.5.) <HI>They that are af|ter the Spirit, do mind the Things of the Spirit.</HI> The very Nature of the&s;e Things, and their Place in the Scheme of Redemption, &s;peaks their nearly concerning us, and their directly tending to influence our whole Temper &amp; Conduct: &s;o that it's ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e, they &s;hould be <HI>minded</HI> at all truly, if they be not minded <HI>practically.</HI> Where there are no Impre&s;&s;ions and Effects corre|&s;ponding to the Nature and Moment of <HI>the Things of the Spirit,</HI> Men do not properly <HI>mind</HI> them, but rather treat them as Things of Indifference and Impertinency to them.</P>
<P>Now by Way of <HI>U&s;e</HI> (omitting many Inferences) I &s;hall only offer the following Hints.</P>
<P N="1">1. It's Matter of &s;orrowful Reflection, that the <HI>holy Spirit,</HI> his Office and Agency in the <HI>Application</HI> of Redemption, are &s;o much <HI>forgotten</HI> (either doctrinally and &s;peculatively, or virtually and practically) in the profe&s;&s;ing World: and when we con&s;ider the Impieties but of <HI>one Year,</HI> it may well make us wonder, that He hath not utterly <HI>for&s;aken</HI> this evil Generation. &mdash; An ab&s;olute, total, and final Dereliction would be but a ju&s;t Puni&s;hment upon an

<P N="2">2.

May Con&s;cience now awake to it's Office, and reduce you to Con&s;ideration, before it be too late! <HI>As &s;aith the Holy Gho&s;t, To Day if ye will hear his Voice, harden not your Hearts.</HI> Dread that awful Charge lying again&s;t you, <HI>Ye &s;tiffnecked, and uncircumci&s;ed in Heart and Ears, ye do always re&s;i&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> Be not deceived: <HI>It is a fearful Thing, to fall into the Hands of the living God.</HI> Nor can you expect any other End, unle&s;s you &s;hould be chang'd and <HI>born of the Spirit:</HI> for <HI>if any Man have not the Spirit of Chri&s;t, he is none of his;</HI> and <HI>with|out Chri&s;t,</HI> no Salvation.

Have you had merciful Re&s;traints from Sin, A&s;&s;i&s;tances in the Chri&s;tian Life, An&s;wers of Prayer, Supports and Con&s;olations under Trou|bles, or a Sen&s;e of Covenant-Kindne&s;s &s;weetning temporal En|joyments, &amp;c.? Now think the&s;e Things over, &s;ing the Prai&s;es of &s;overeign Grace, and give the Spirit of Chri&s;t the Glory of his ble&s;&s;ed Agency in &amp; for you. But be humbled in the Reflection upon all your &s;inful Neglects and Di&s;honours to his Name. &mdash; And be &s;olicitous, that this <HI>new Year</HI> may open with new Di&s;co|veries of the <HI>Things of the Spirit,</HI> with new Experiences of his Power and Grace, and new Evidences of his dwelling in you. Begin the Year with lamenting the &s;ad Remains of Darkne&s;s and Corruption in you, and with an earne&s;t Care of Improvement in vital Piety, with &s;olemn Self-Dedication to God, with renewed Vows of a more clo&s;e Walk with God; and to that End, with pathetick and believing Supplications for the <HI>Renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> without whom you are Nothing and can do Nothing. Be importunate with God, that the Year now beginning may be very remarkably a <HI>Year of the Right Hand of the mo&s;t High,</HI> in a general <HI>Reviving of his Work</HI> among his People; and in &s;pecial, that you may be <HI>filled with the Spirit.</HI> Pray for the <HI>Spirit,</HI> to fill every Ordinance and every Providence, to fill the Mini&s;try of the Word, to fill the Hou&s;e of God, and to fill your Clo&s;et, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that you may make happy Advances in Soul-Pro&s;perity &amp; holy Fruit|fulne&s;s. &mdash; Nor content your &s;elves in the Ab&s;ence of the <HI>Com|forter</HI> at any Time, but a&s;pire after the <HI>Joy of the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> that you may in this and every remaining Year &s;erve the Lord with Gladne&s;s of Heart. &mdash; Be you <HI>after the Spirit,</HI> in point of Con|formity to Him and Pur&s;uit of Him; and both contemplatively and practically <HI>mind the Things of the Spirit.</HI> So you will be pre|pared for all the Events of the Year; and may be chearful Ex|pectants of Sufferings, and of Death and Judgment. &mdash; In fine,

<P N="3">III. Years of Remarkable <HI>Providences,</HI> in a way of temporal Salvation and Mercy, are al&s;o <HI>Years of the Right Hand of the mo&s;t High,</HI> to be <HI>remembred</HI> by us.</P>
<P>Indeed this Character is, in providential Re&s;pects, properly enough applicable to <HI>every Year.</HI> For the &s;ame <HI>almighty Hand,</HI> which originally formed all Things, &s;till &s;upports and governs the Univer&s;e, from Year to Year; perpetually &s;uperintending the whole Circle of Cau&s;es and Effects, in every Sy&s;tem of his Crea|tures, natural and moral. The <HI>World is his,</HI> with the Fulne&s;s thereof: and <HI>his Eyes</HI> are always upon it, <HI>from the Beginning of the Year, even to the End of the Year. The Day</HI> is his, the <HI>Night</HI> al&s;o is his, and He keeps up their alternate Succe&s;&s;ion thro' out the <HI>Year.</HI> The Number of it's <HI>Months</HI> is with Him, and He continues their regular Series, with all the Variety of their Com|plexion, Produce, and Influence. He revolves it's different Sea|&s;ons. <HI>Summer</HI> and <HI>Winter, Seed-time</HI> and <HI>Harve&s;t, Cold</HI> and <HI>Heat,</HI> have their yearly Returns by his Appointment and Efficience. The Heaven, Earth, and Sea, the Sun, Moon, and Stars, Fire, Air, and Elements, with their various Powers, Motions, &amp; Ope|rations, are all under his &s;upreme Dominion, his continual Direc|tion, and Controul. He perpetuates the di&s;tinct Species of cre|ated Beings, maintains their Order and Dependance, &amp; excites, &s;u&s;pends, or limits, and over-rules their re&s;pective Virtues and Actions, according to the Coun&s;el of his own Will.&mdash;He <HI>pre&s;erveth

Man</HI> and <HI>Bea&s;t,</HI> and <HI>giveth Food to all Fle&s;h.</HI> He <HI>ruleth in the Kingdoms of Men,</HI> and <HI>is the Governour among the Nations,</HI> pre&s;id|ing over all the Affairs and Intere&s;ts of Societies and Per&s;ons, di&s;|pen&s;ing all that Variety of temporal Good, which brightens the <HI>Year</HI> from Time to Time. Our annual Pre&s;ervations and Deli|verances, Succe&s;&s;es and Supplies, our daily Benefits, Supports, and Comforts in every Part of the Year and Period of Life, are the Re&s;ults of a vigilant and bountiful Providence. Nor is there a &s;ingle <HI>Year,</HI> how little &s;oever di&s;tingui&s;h'd by uncommon Occur|rences, but what is repleni&s;h'd with the Mercies of God and with my&s;terious and va&s;t Events, that witne&s;s to his Being, Perfecti|ons, &amp; Government. So that even the mo&s;t <HI>common</HI> Years may with Propriety be &s;tiled <HI>Years of the Right Hand of the mo&s;t High:</HI> and the In&s;tances of his Care and Kindne&s;s from <HI>Year</HI> to <HI>Year,</HI> in ge|neral, are numerous and &s;ignificant enough to de&s;erve our grateful Acknowledgements, and a frequent &s;erious Recollection, with a View to the practical Returns expected from us. God requires, that we <HI>regard the Operations of his Hand:</HI> Va&s;t are the Advan|tages of doing this, but equal the Mi&s;chiefs of neglecting it. God hath a <HI>Book of Remembrance written before Him,</HI> wherein are re|corded all his Providences, and all our Improvements: and e'er long He will call us to a <HI>Reckoning,</HI> nor &s;hall we be able to <HI>give an Account of our Steward&s;hip, with Joy, and not with Grief,</HI> unle&s;s we practi&s;e that <HI>Ob&s;ervation</HI> and <HI>Remembrance</HI> of his Dealings with us, which make up &s;o great a Part of the Duty of the Chri&s;tian Life. <HI>Who&s;o is wi&s;e, will ob&s;erve the&s;e Things.</HI> Nor indeed with|out fir&s;t <HI>ob&s;erving,</HI> &s;hall we be able to <HI>remember</HI> them: &amp; without <HI>remembring</HI> them, we &s;hall but <HI>evilly requite the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;till &s;ome <HI>Years</HI> are di&s;tingui&s;h'd in Providence, and by Way of Eminence claim this Character in our Text: which therefore we ought to &s;et an Afteri&s;m upon, and &s;ignali&s;e in our grateful Commemorations. There's a Diver&s;ity of <HI>Years,</HI> even as a &s;o|vereign God is pleas'd to <HI>change the Times</HI> and <HI>Sea&s;ons.</HI> Some are made remarkable by <HI>Judgments:</HI> nor are the&s;e to be unheeded or forgotten by us. But our <HI>Text</HI> points at Years of a contrary A&s;pect, brighten'd with <HI>pro&s;perous</HI> Events, &amp; recommended to our delightful Remembrance by <HI>benign</HI> Di&s;pen&s;ations, wherein the <HI>Goodne&s;s</HI> of God appears with a &s;uperiour Lu&s;tre.

<P>God hath in the Scripture-Hi&s;tory given us la&s;ting <HI>Memorials</HI> of his wonderful Works in ancient Times, which we &s;hould of|ten review, with &s;erious Meditation: Nor &s;hould we &s;light the Memory of le&s;s di&s;tant Ages.

<P>If we reflect on the Story of <HI>New England,</HI> whether re&s;pecting it's Beginnings or Improvements, we &s;hall find &s;ome of the mo&s;t <HI>wondrous Works of God</HI> pre&s;enting them&s;elves to our View, great Salvations and great Benefits, worthy to be had in <HI>everla&s;ting Re|membrance.</HI> We &s;hould frequently look back on the fir&s;t Times of <HI>New England,</HI> and not forget tho&s;e <HI>Years of the Right Hand of the mo&s;t High.</HI> Such, in an impartial View of the Ca&s;e, were tho&s;e di&s;tingui&s;h'd <HI>Years,</HI> wherein our pious <HI>Forefathers</HI> flying from the Face of Per&s;ecution and Oppre&s;&s;ion, <HI>God gave them Deliverance, &s;ought out a Place of Retreat for them and for their little ones,</HI> bro't them &s;afe over the wide and dangerous Ocean, and planted them here in a <HI>good Land,</HI> by his own Sword driving out the <HI>Heathen</HI> Natives to make Way for his People, and honouring them with eminent Tokens of his gracious Pre&s;ence, Protection, and Bene|diction. &mdash; Nor has He been a Wilderne&s;s to the <HI>&s;ucceding</HI> Ge|nerations; but his <HI>Paths</HI> have been <HI>Mercy</HI> and <HI>Truth</HI> toward his People, even unto this Day, when for our great Degeneracies He might ju&s;tly <HI>con&s;ume our Years in Trouble.</HI> Tho' there have been <HI>Years wherein we have &s;een Evil,</HI> yet have there been al&s;o <HI>Years of</HI> favourable <HI>Vi&s;itation:</HI> we have <HI>fa&s;ted and &s;een that the Lord is good,</HI> and have experienc'd the <HI>&s;aving Strength of his Right
