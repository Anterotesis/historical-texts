<P>WHEREAS by the Confu&s;ions occa&s;ioned in the Saxon, Dani&s;h, and Norman Wars, the <HI>Records</HI> of Ma&s;ons have been much vitiated, the Free-Ma&s;ons of Eng|land twice thought it nece&s;&s;ary to correct their <HI>Con&s;titutions, Charges,</HI> and <HI>Regulations;</HI> fir&s;t in the Reign of king Athel|&s;tan the Saxon, and long after in the Reign of King Ed|ward IV. the Norman: And whereas the old <HI>Con&s;titutions</HI> in England have been much interpolated, mangled, and mi&s;erably corrupted, not only with fal&s;e Spelling, but even with many fal&s;e Facts and gro&s;s Errors in Hi&s;tory and Chronology, through Length of Time, and the Ignorance of Tran&s;cribers, in the dark illiterate Ages, before the Revival of Geometry and ancient Architecture, to the great Offence of all the learned and judicious Brethren, whereby al&s;o the Ignorant have been deceiv'd.</P>
<P>And our late worthy Grand-Ma&s;ter, his Grace the Duke of MONTAGU, having order'd the Author to peru&s;e, cor|rect, and dige&s;t into a new and better Method, the Hi&s;to|ry, Charges, and Regulations of the ancient Fraternity; He has accordingly examin'd &s;everal Copies from Italy and Scotland, and &s;undry Parts of England, and from thence, (tho' in many things erroneous) and from &s;everal other an|cient Records of Ma&s;ons, he has drawn forth the above-written <HI>new Con&s;titutions,</HI> with the Charges and General Regulations.
