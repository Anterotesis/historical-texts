</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_DEATH is elegantly de&s;cribed in Scripture, as <HI>the King of terrors:</HI> And to an eye of &s;en&s;e is a mo&s;t formidable evil. It tears down the&s;e tabernacles of clay, which are the habitations of our immortal &s;pirits: It turns the&s;e beautiful and active bodies, into heaps of deformity and corruption: It &s;eparates us from this world and its agreable enjoyments, and fixes the &s;oul in an <HI>unalterable</HI> &s;tate of happine&s;s or mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>SO great is the fondne&s;s of mankind for this pre&s;ent life; &mdash; &s;o &s;trong their aver&s;ion to a di&s;&s;olution; that we need the highe&s;t cordials to &s;upport us again&s;t the approaches of Death, and to enable us with a becoming fortitude to en|counter this grand enemy of human nature.</P>
<P>AND, Ble&s;&s;ed be God, the Go&s;pel has laid a &s;ufficient foundation for our &s;upport and comfort in this melancholly hour. &mdash; Our great
<PB N="4" REF="005268_0004_1016F2C638A4EA60">
REDEEMER hath &s;cattered the darkne&s;s of the grave, <HI>and brought life and immortality to light. Thro'</HI> the vertue of his own meritorious <HI>death; he hath de&s;troyed him that had the power of death, that is the devil, and delivered them who thro' fear of death, were all their life time &s;ubject to bondage.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Heb.</HI> II. 14, 15.</NOTE> In his name, and by the victorious power of his grace, every true believer may meet this univer&s;al terror of mankind with an holy triumph, and lay down his head in the du&s;t with &s;erenity and joy.</P>
<P>THE Go&s;pel repre&s;ents death to the true Chri&s;tian, not as an enemy but as a friend: Not as the object of their terror and aver&s;ion, but rather of their complacency and de&s;ire. It de|&s;cribes our departure out of this world, as a deliverance from this vale of tears, and an intro|duction to a &s;tate of con&s;ummate ble&s;&s;edne&s;s: A tran&s;lation from the fading enjoyments of time, to all the ineffable glories of eternity.</P>
<P>UPON the&s;e principles many of the Di&s;ciples of JESUS have welcom'd the approach of death as the me&s;&s;enger of their heavenly Father, and breath'd out their &s;ouls into the hands of God with extacy and triumph. A pro&s;pect of obtaining complete deliverance from &s;in their greate&s;t burden, and dwelling with Chri&s;t their &s;upreme delight, has wonderfully reconciled their tho'ts

to a dying hour, and changed the dark valley of the &s;hadow of death, into a &s;cene of light and glory.</P>
<P>THUS the Apo&s;tle in my text, with an holy impatience, looks forward to the time of his di&s;|&s;olution, and waits for the happy period, as the weary traveller for the grateful &s;hades of the evening.</P>
<Q><HI>Having a de&s;ire to depart,</HI> AND TO BE WITH CHRIST, WHICH IS FAR BETTER.</Q>
<P>In &s;peaking to which words I &s;hall (by divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance) proceed in the following method:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, I &s;hall &s;hew that every true believer, when he departs out of this world goes to Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Secondly, THIS is infinitely better than to abide in the fle&s;h.</P>

<HEAD>FIRST PART.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY true believer, when he departs out of this world, goes to Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>THIS was not peculiar to this favourite Apo&s;tle, but is the common privilege of every true Chri&s;tian: When we <HI>are ab&s;ent from the body, then we are pre&s;ent with the Lord.</HI> The Doctrine of Purgatory is an idle fiction of the Prie&s;ts of mammon, contrived and propagated to e&s;tabli&s;h
<PB N="6" REF="005268_0006_1016F2C94B29ECE8">
the tyranny of the BISHOP OF <HI>ROME,</HI> and &s;upport the grandeur of the PAPAL EMPIRE. The Opinion of the Sleep of the Soul, till the morning of the general re&s;urrection, is a &s;en&s;ele&s;s dream, de&s;tructive of the very nature and e&s;&s;ence of an immaterial &s;pirit, and contrary to many plain and expre&s;s pa&s;&s;ages in the in&s;pired Scrip|tures. &mdash; Why &s;hould the Apo&s;tle expect with plea&s;ure the time of his &s;eparation from the body, if death were to ca&s;t him into an in&s;en&s;ible &s;lumber, and deprive him of all tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed commmunications of divine LIFE and LOVE which he enjoy'd upon earth? &mdash; Why &s;hould he de&s;ire to be di&s;&s;olv'd and be with Chri&s;t, if all his perceptive powers were to be chain'd up in a profound &s;leep, and he was to remain for &s;o long a &s;ea&s;on without any delightful views of the divine glory, or any participation of the joys of his immediate pre&s;ence? &mdash; Upon this &s;uppo|&s;ition, it would be evidently more eligible to abide in the fle&s;h, amid&s;t the labours and enjoy|ments of this life, than to &s;ink into an in&s;en&s;ible &s;tate, and &s;pend &s;o many years in darkne&s;s and oblivion. But not to enlarge, &mdash;</P>
<P>NOTHING is more plain than that the &s;cripture gives no countenance to this ab&s;urd and unrea&s;onable imagination: But on the contrary a&s;&s;ures us, that <HI>when this earthly hou&s;e of our
<PB N="7" REF="005268_0007_1016F2CB0C2A1ED8">
tabernacle is di&s;&s;olved, we have a building of God, an hou&s;e not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Cor.</HI> V. 1.</NOTE> Hence our Lord declares unto the penitent thief, when in the agonies of death, <HI>THIS DAY &s;halt thou be with me in Paradi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>NOW to be with Chri&s;t, implies that the believer upon his departure out of this world, &s;hall be immediately introduced into his divine pre&s;ence, and be favoured with an intuitive vi&s;ion of his glory. No &s;ooner are they delivered from the burden of the fle&s;h, but immediately they mount up upon the wings of love, and are con|vey'd by a bright guard of mini&s;tring &s;pirits into the imperial palace of heaven, &mdash; the pre&s;ence chamber of their exalted Redeemer; where they &s;ee him, not in the humble form of a &s;ervant, but in the maje&s;tic &s;tate of an incarnate GOD: &mdash; Not in the inferior circum&s;tances of poverty and di&s;grace, but incircled with all the dazzling &s;plendors of heaven: &mdash; Not crown'd with thorns, but diadems of cele&s;tial glory: &mdash; Not hanging upon an infamous cro&s;s, but &s;eated on the right-hand of the Maje&s;ty on high: &mdash; Not &s;urrounded with in&s;ulting crouds of in&s;olent &s;inners, but in|compa&s;s'd with myriads of &s;potle&s;s &s;aints.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="005268_0008_1016F2CF19EF6B68">THIS mu&s;t needs be to every true believer a &s;cene of the pure&s;t joy, the &s;ublime&s;t plea&s;ure. &mdash; If St. <HI>Peter</HI> was &s;o tran&s;ported with a tran&s;ient glimp&s;e of his glory, when transfigured on the mount, that he forgot this lower world, and cried out, <HI>Lord it is good to be here;</HI> how will the &s;aints exult and triumph when they have not only a vani&s;hing glance, but a full view of his beautiful countenance: Not on Mount <HI>Tabor,</HI> in company with <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Elias,</HI> but &s;tanding upon the Holy Hill of <HI>Zion,</HI> attended by the whole hierarchy of heaven. &mdash; If the Di&s;ciples were glad, when they &s;aw their Lord break a&s;under the bars of the grave, and ri&s;e from the dead; how great will be their joy, when they &s;ee him &s;eated upon a radiant throne, and &s;waying the &s;ceptre of the invi&s;ible world.</P>
<P>WHAT can be more delightful to the&s;e holy &s;ouls, than to enjoy the ble&s;&s;ed &s;ociety of their deare&s;t friend, and mo&s;t generous benefactor; &mdash; to dwell continually with him, on who&s;e name they have believed, in who&s;e merits they have confided, and from who&s;e hands they have re|ceived a crown of eternal Life? How will it revive and rejoice their hearts, to behold him who was &s;o unrighteou&s;ly de&s;pi&s;ed, &s;o inhumanly tortured, &s;o ignominiou&s;ly crucified for their &s;akes; advanced to the highe&s;t pitch of &s;plendor and
<PB N="9" REF="005268_0009_1016F2D306515EE0">
dignity, honoured and adored by all the happy inhabitants above; who with one con&s;ent ca&s;t their crowns at his feet, and celebrate the prai&s;es of his redeeming grace? With what rapturous plea&s;ure &s;hall they hear from his own ble&s;&s;ed lips, the amazing hi&s;tory of his Love, the mighty triumphs of his Grace, and the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;orrows he pa&s;t thro' for the redemption of an apo&s;tate world.</P>
<P>ESPECIALLY, Since they not only behold his glory, but dwell under the perpetual effu&s;ions of his love: They not only &s;ee his face, but partake of his goodne&s;s; they not only view the amiable excellencies of his nature, but find by happy experience all tho&s;e divine attributes en|gaged to promote their perfection and happine&s;s. In the pre&s;ent &s;tate he advances them to the dignity of his children, adorns them with the graces of his &s;pirit, and affords them the reviving foreta&s;tes of his love; but in heaven he unfolds all the trea&s;ures of his goodne&s;s, and &s;howers down the boundle&s;s riches of his glory, into their purified and enlarged bo&s;oms. The Ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer looks down upon them with infinite plea&s;ure, as the &s;acred purcha&s;e of his blood, and the conque&s;ts of his almighty grace; and is highly delighted with the reflection of his own

<P>AND now, what higher conception of hap|pine&s;s can we frame, than to dwell for ever with the be&s;t and mo&s;t amiable of BEINGS; to love him with the mo&s;t ardent affection; to receive the continual vi&s;its of <HI>his favour, which is life, and his loving kindne&s;s which is better than life it&s;elf.</HI> HAPPY SOULS! who are incircled in the arms of everla&s;ting mercy, and lie imparadi&s;ed in the bo&s;om of GOD. They now, more than ever, rejoice in God their Saviour, and perpe|tually triumph in their union to and communion with him: They break forth in the language of the &s;pou&s;e. &mdash; <HI>As the apple-tree among the trees of the wood, &s;o is my beloved among the &s;ons: I &s;it under his &s;hadow with great delight, and his fruit is plea&s;ant unto my ta&s;te: he has brought me into his banquetting-hou&s;e, and &s;pread his banner of love over me.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cant.</HI> II. 3-5.</NOTE> &mdash; This it is to be with Chri&s;t. &mdash; But how broken and imperfect an account are we able to give of tho&s;e joys, <HI>which eye hath not &s;een, nor ear heard, nor hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> II. 9.</NOTE> their excellency and glory.

defiled with &s;in, and encompa&s;s'd with darkne&s;s.

<P>LET us then proceed to con&s;ider in what re&s;pects <HI>to be with Christ is far better.</HI></P>
<P>THE body indeed is &s;ubject to a melancholly change; &mdash; tho&s;e <HI>eyes</HI> are clo&s;ed in darkne&s;s, that once beheld the light of the &s;un, and the beauties of this lower creation; &mdash; tho&s;e <HI>hands</HI> are rendered u&s;ele&s;s, that were active in&s;truments in the various offices of life; &mdash; tho&s;e <HI>feet</HI> are fettered with the bands of death, that went about doing good: &mdash; our <HI>vi&s;ible frame</HI> is utterly de|moli&s;hed, and blended with its original du&s;t; but the Soul is delivered from the pri&s;on in which it was long confined, and in all re&s;pects makes a ble&s;&s;ed exchange: &mdash; For,</P>
<P N="1">I. THEY change a &s;tate of toil and labour, for that of ea&s;e and refre&s;hment: While upon
<PB N="12" REF="005268_0012_1016F2DA46AA5838">
earth, the &s;ervants of God are nece&s;&s;arily engaged in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the world, and are often called to a great deal of trouble and fatigue. While encumbered with the&s;e tabernacles of clay, and &s;urrounded with an en&s;naring world, they are obliged to be upon their perpetual guard, to <HI>watch and pray, le&s;t they enter into temptation.</HI> But the &s;aints above are delivered from all the&s;e toil&s;ome labours: &mdash; <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the dead, who die in the Lord; for they re&s;t from their labours, and their works follow them.</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rev.</HI> XIV. 13.</NOTE> <HI>They have fought the good fight, they have fini&s;hed their cour&s;e, henceforth there is laid up for them a crown of righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Tim.</HI> IV. 7, 8.</NOTE> They are no longer condemn'd to earn their bread with the &s;weat of their brows, but are fed with the heavenly <HI>Manna,</HI> the <HI>food of Angels!</HI> They no more &s;pend their weari&s;ome days in the pur&s;uit of their general or particular callings; but receive the approbation of their Lord, and the reward of faithful &s;ervants. It is now no &s;mall part of a Chri&s;tian's exerci&s;e, to bear up with a becoming fortitude and courage again&s;t the darkne&s;s, and difficulties, the temptations, and &s;ufferings of this pre&s;ent life; but when their &s;pirit's are lodged in <HI>Abraham</HI>'s bo&s;om, they have no more &s;ufferings to go through, no more lu&s;ts to mortify, no more enemies to conquer: <HI>Patience

has had its perfect work;</HI> their day of battle is over, and their warfare is finally accompli&s;h'd.</P>
<P>NOT that the righteous will lead an idle and unactive life: This would be contrary to the oeconomy of heaven, and an abatement of their particular happine&s;s. &mdash; In what employments they will be engaged, we know not; &mdash; upon this head the &s;cripture is &s;ilent; and it becomes us not to be wi&s;e above what is written. But this we know, &mdash; that they are perpetually engaged in the &s;ervice of God; &s;tand before him in the character of mini&s;tring &s;pirits, inviolably keep|ing the charge of his commandments: They join the bli&s;sful choir above in the joyful celebration of the divine prai&s;es, and re&s;t not day and night, &s;aying, &mdash; <HI>Holy, Holy, Holy, LORD GOD ALMIGHTY!</HI> And doubtle&s;s they look back with a grateful mixture of plea&s;ure and &s;urprize, upon the various &s;cenes of providence toward them, while they dwelt upon earth; and adore the &s;tupendous methods of divine grace, by which they were kept in the mid&s;t of number|le&s;s dangers, and &s;afely guided and pre&s;erved in the ways of &s;alvation. Doubtle&s;s with the highe&s;t affection and gratitude, they rai&s;e fre|quent and delightful &s;ongs to the honour of the beloved JESUS; who &s;aved them from the ignominious bondage of &s;in, by his almighty
<PB N="14" REF="005268_0014_1016F2DFCE50FA60">
power; who ju&s;tified them by his perfect righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, and has finally made them the ever|la&s;ting monuments of his &s;overeign mercy.</P>
<P N="2">II. THEY pa&s;s out of a valley of tears, into a world of light and joy. The evils that attend human life, are as numerous, and often as violent as the tempe&s;tuous waves of the &s;ea. Various and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive afflictions, like <HI>Job</HI>'s me&s;&s;engers, tread clo&s;e upon the heels of each other. &mdash; Our Bodies are the &s;eat of innumerable di&s;ea&s;es; they frequently totter and &s;hake, and are &s;wiftly tending to the grave, <HI>the hou&s;e appointed for the living.</HI> &mdash; Our Characters are expo&s;ed to the malignant breath of envy and malice. &mdash; Our E&s;tates to rapine and violence. &mdash; And our deare&s;t Friends are oftentimes &s;natched from our affectionate embraces. Upon the&s;e accounts, it is ju&s;tly &s;aid, that <HI>men is born to trouble as the &s;parks fly upward.</HI> But all the&s;e evils are confined to this tran&s;itory &s;cene. The &s;aints at death are tran&s;lated to a world of perfect light, and un|mingled joy: They are admitted to that place which infinite wi&s;dom has contrived, almighty power hath framed, and everla&s;ting love hath appointed for the reception of his cho&s;en friends, his di&s;tingui&s;hed favourites. &mdash; <HI>There</HI> he &s;heds abroad his brighte&s;t glory, and &s;howers down his abundant grace, to the unutterable tran&s;port of its happy inhabitants. &mdash; <HI>There</HI> &s;hines a bright
<PB N="15" REF="005268_0015_1016F2E2A2011400">
and eternal day, without any intervening clouds or darkne&s;s. &mdash; <HI>There</HI> all is calm and &s;erene, without confu&s;ion or di&s;order; <HI>all tears are wiped from their eyes;</HI> all &s;orrow bani&s;hed from their brea&s;ts. &mdash; <HI>There</HI> is no more pain, no more death, <HI>for the former Things are pa&s;&s;ed away:</HI> In the&s;e peaceful regions, <HI>the wicked cea&s;e from troubling, and the weary are at re&s;t:</HI> Their joys are without mixture or alloy; their plea&s;ures divine and perpetual; and the remembrance of their pa&s;t afflictions, &s;erves only to encrea&s;e their pre&s;ent &s;atisfaction, and inflame their gratitude to their almighty Deliverer.</P>
<P N="3">III. THEY are tran&s;lated from a world of &s;in and temptation, to a &s;tate of purity and perfection. The true Chri&s;tian, even in this imperfect &s;tate, is ab&s;olved from the guilt of &s;in, the cur&s;e of the fiery law, and the condemning &s;entence of divine ju&s;tice. He is al&s;o &s;aved from the tyrannical reign of lu&s;t, and no longer lives in a voluntary &s;ubjection to its unrea&s;onable demands. The dominion of &s;in was de&s;troyed in the day of his fir&s;t conver&s;ion; and its intere&s;ts are gradually decaying thro' the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive periods of the chri&s;tian life.</P>
<P>BUT our univer&s;al nature is &s;o deeply infected with this &s;preading <HI>lepro&s;y,</HI> that it will never be perfectly purged out, while the earthly hou&s;e of
<PB N="16" REF="005268_0016_1016F2E555892B18">
this tabernacle remains undi&s;&s;olved. Our mo&s;t exact obedience to the divine law, is attended with innumerable defects, and our highe&s;t acts of faith weakened with the remains of unbelief. Our pure&s;t gold has an alloy of dro&s;s, and our be&s;t duties are polluted with &s;inful mixtures.</P>
<P>THIS is the con&s;tant burthen of the &s;aints upon earth; and above all things embitters the pre&s;ent life, with its enjoyments. The relicks of indwelling corruption, ca&s;t a gloom upon their brighte&s;t days, and often obliges them to breathe out that melancholly complaint, in the pa&s;&s;ionate language of the Apo&s;tle, &mdash; <HI>O wretched man that I am, who &s;hall deliver me from the body of this death!</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> VII. 24.</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT no &s;ooner is the vital tie di&s;&s;olved between the &s;oul and body, but they are entirely purified from all remains of &s;in, and made perfect in holine&s;s forever. Every corrupt affection and inclination is buried in the du&s;t of death; and their &s;anctified &s;pirits &s;tand before the throne of GOD, without &s;pot or blemi&s;h, without deformity or di&s;order. &mdash; O happy DAY! O joyful DELIVERANCE! when the &s;ervants of Chri&s;t &s;hall no longer complain of any &s;inful darkne&s;s in their under&s;tanding, any remaining rebellion in their wills, or any defiling di&s;order in their
<PB N="17" REF="005268_0017_1016B924B3594380">
affections. &mdash; O thrice HAPPY SOULS! who are not only delivered from &s;in, but from all temp|tation to it; &mdash; who have no more difficulties to conquer; &mdash; no more dangers to encounter; &mdash; no more &s;piritual enemies to vanqui&s;h; but have overcome <HI>thro' the blood of the Lamb,</HI> and are entered into a &s;tate of perfect victory and eternal triumph.</P>
<P>SURELY, to be with Chri&s;t is be&s;t of all! for &s;uch are a&s;cended above the territories of the prince of darkne&s;s, and are out of the reach of all his fiery a&s;&s;aults: They dwell where there is no <HI>roaring lion</HI> to devour; no <HI>&s;ubtle &s;erpent</HI> to allure; no malignant influences to de&s;troy their purity, or di&s;turb their happine&s;s. That promi&s;e is completely fulfilled, &mdash; <HI>To him that overcometh, will I grant to &s;it with me in my throne, even as I al&s;o overcame, and am &s;et down with my Father in his throne.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rev.</HI> III. 21.</NOTE></P>

<P N="2">II. THIS affords abundant ground of comfort, when the &s;ervants of Chri&s;t are taken from us by death. Their piety gives no exemption from the common accidents of life: They fall by the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;es with the re&s;t of mankind; and their bodies are buried in the common du&s;t. &mdash; In this re&s;pect, there is <HI>one event to the righteous, and the wicked;</HI> &mdash; the &s;ervants of God and the &s;ubjects of Satan.

<P>LET then the wicked tremble at the approach of the <HI>king of terrors;</HI> but let us congratulate the righteous upon their deliverance out of this world, the abode of guilt and &s;orrow. &mdash; They have left

our &s;ociety, for the <HI>innumerable company of angels, and the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect.</HI> &mdash; They have laid a&s;ide their polluted garments, for the &s;potle&s;s robes of purity and righteou&s;ne&s;s. &mdash; Their eyes &s;hall no longer flow down with tears, nor their tongues utter the language of complaint, &mdash; all their difficulties are removed, &mdash; all their clouds &s;cattered, &mdash; all their doubts re&s;olved.

<P>AND, Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, we have ju&s;t ground to believe, that the&s;e are the happy circum&s;tances of our DEPARTED BROTHER, who&s;e death has occa&s;ioned the pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e. &mdash; I am not fond of funeral encomiums; nor aver&s;e to pay a ju&s;t tribute of honour to tho&s;e GOD his di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by his grace, and made uncommonly u&s;eful in the world; &mdash; <HI>The memory of the just is ble&s;&s;ed, and the righteous &s;hould be had in everla&s;ting remembrance.</HI> To give flattering titles, I am &s;ure is contrary to my principles, and, I think, as di&s;tant from my temper.

decea&s;ed <HI>Friend,</HI> which were <HI>lovely and of good report;</HI> and recommend them to the imitation of the &s;urvivors.</P>
<P>HE was born and brought up in the bo&s;om of the CHURCH OF SCOTLAND; and ever retained the highe&s;t reverence for its DOCTRINE, CONSTITUTION and DISCIPLINE. He was educated in the <HI>Univer&s;ity of EDINBURGH,</HI> and advanced by that illu&s;trious Body, to the highe&s;t honours that belong to his profe&s;&s;ion. &mdash; But piety is the brighte&s;t ornament of human nature; and of this he was a &s;hining example. He was favoured with a religious education, which made an early impre&s;&s;ion upon his mind, and thro' grace di&s;po&s;ed him to a thoughtful concern for his eternal welfare. In the younger years of life, &mdash; in tho&s;e days which in the lan|guage of <HI>Solomon,</HI> are emphatically &s;tiled <HI>the days of vanity;</HI> he gave up him&s;elf to GOD, and joyfully entered under the bonds of the covenant of grace; and in the cour&s;e of a long and u&s;eful life, maintained the honour of his profe&s;&s;ion, and adorned it by a conver&s;ation becoming the Go&s;pel. He dedicated his morning hours to the &s;acred exerci&s;es of devotion; and ro&s;e early, that he might have time to conver&s;e with GOD and divine things, without noi&s;e or interruption. He was very punctual and exemplary in the devotions of his family; and took care, not only of the
<PB N="25" REF="005268_0025_1016F2FE63FFDDB8">
bodies, but &s;ouls, of tho&s;e committed to his charge; in&s;tructing them in the principles of religion, and exhorting them to the &s;ervice of his and their common LORD.</P>
<P>THESE WALLS will be a la&s;ting monument of his zeal for the hou&s;e and public wor&s;hip of GOD; in the erecting of which he &s;pent a con|&s;iderable part of his e&s;tate; and undertook a hazardous voyage to <HI>EUROPE,</HI> for the e&s;tabli&s;hment and &s;ecurity of this infant &s;ociety. Upon the&s;e, and other accounts too numerous to be mentioned, &mdash; while a PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in the <HI>City of NEW-YORK,</HI> the name of D^R. NICOLL, will ever be remembered with honour, as one of its principal <HI>Founders,</HI> and greate&s;t <HI>Benefactor.</HI></P>
<P>THERE were few projects &s;et on foot, for the propagation of undefiled religion, in which his affectionate de&s;ires were not engaged for their pro&s;perity, and his charitable contributions for their &s;upport.</P>
<P>IN the bu&s;ine&s;s of his calling, he was faithful and &s;ucce&s;sful. He <HI>went about doing good,</HI> with unwearied diligence; not barely from a worldly motive, &mdash; that he might increa&s;e his bu&s;ine&s;s, and recommend him&s;elf to his patients; but from a &s;en&s;e of duty to GOD, and an affectionate regard to the lives and health of men.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="005268_0026_1016F300401E74E0">FROM this principle it was, that he not only vi&s;ited the poor in their &s;ickne&s;s, and admini&s;tred to them, without any pro&s;pect of gain; &mdash; but al&s;o with a large and bountiful hand di&s;pen&s;ed his charity among them. He was never deaf to the complaints of the mi&s;era|ble; nor blind to the objects of pity and compa&s;&s;ion: His eye affected his heart, and his hand was continually &s;tretched forth for their relief and &s;upport. His charities were not at|tended with noi&s;e and o&s;tentation, nor proclaimed with the &s;ound of a trumpet; but carefully concealed from the eyes of the world; and like the gentle &s;howers of heaven, de&s;cended in a &s;ecret and &s;ilent plenty. There are few men to whom tho&s;e words of <HI>Job</HI> may be more ju&s;tly applied, &mdash; <HI>he delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherle&s;s that had none to help him: the ble&s;&s;ing of her that was ready to peri&s;h came upon him, and he cau&s;ed the widow's heart to &s;ing for joy.</HI> In the character of a friend, he was kind and beneficient, chearfully embracing all opportunities of doing good, within the circle of his acquaintance.</P>
<P>IF I &s;hould go on, and con&s;ider him in the &s;tation of a <HI>Hu&s;band, Father,</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> &mdash; he de&s;erves the character of one of the FIRST THREE; and upon a ju&s;t compari&s;on, will be found to have left but few equals. &mdash; But the
<PB N="27" REF="005268_0027_1016F3041EED82D0">
mo&s;t amiable qualifications of nature, and riche&s;t endowments of grace, afford no exemption from the common law of mortality. Our dear Friend, &mdash; THE BELOVED PHYSICIAN, &mdash; is dead!</P>
<P>HIS di&s;temper was &s;udden, and &s;natch'd him out of the world, almo&s;t without any warning. But during his &s;hort &s;ickne&s;s, he was favoured with the free u&s;e of his under&s;tanding, and the comfortable exerci&s;e of his faith. He declared his only hope of eternal happine&s;s, was built upon the merits and RIGHTEOUSNESS OF JESUS CHRIST, and expre&s;s'd a firm and un&s;haken tru&s;t in that <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer,</HI> to whom he had committed his Soul in the days of his health and &s;trength. He met death without terror, and with calmne&s;s and compo&s;ure, re|&s;igned his immortal &s;pirit into the hands of GOD that gave it.</P>
<P>HIS children have lo&s;t an affectionate parent; &mdash; his &s;ervants an indulgent ma&s;ter; &mdash; the common-wealth a valuable member; &mdash; the church of Chri&s;t a &s;tedfa&s;t friend; &mdash; the &s;ick a &s;kilful phy&s;ician, &mdash; and the poor a generous benefactor: His removal has occa&s;ioned a general grief; but has made the wide&s;t breach in this congregation.</P>
