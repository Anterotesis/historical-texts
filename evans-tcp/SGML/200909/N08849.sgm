<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE natural increa&s;e of people upon the Briti&s;h continent of North-America is &s;o great as to make it highly probable that in a few generations more a mighty Empire will be formed there.</P>
<P>The ri&s;e and progre&s;s of the &s;everal Colonies, of which this Empire will be con&s;tituted, will be &s;ubjects of entertain|ment for &s;peculative and ingenious minds in di&s;tant ages.</P>
<P>He who re&s;cues from oblivion intere&s;t|ing hi&s;torical facts is beneficial to po&s;terity as well as to his contemporaries, and the pro&s;pect thereof to a benevolent mind cau&s;es that employment to be agreeable and plea&s;ant which otherwi&s;e would be irk|&s;ome and painful.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="011300_0003_0F89726F7346CCF0">The papers of which this volume con&s;i&s;ts are intended to &s;upport and elucidate the principal facts related in the fir&s;t part of the Hi&s;tory of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets-Bay, and may &s;erve as an Appendix to it.</P>
<P>The author of that Hi&s;tory was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of many other ancient and very curious original papers, which are irrecoverably lo&s;t by an unfortunate event, &s;ufficiently known.</P>
<P>If this Collection &s;hall be favourably received, another volume of Papers will probably be publi&s;hed, to &s;erve as an Ap|pendix to the &s;econd part of the &s;ame Hi&s;tory.</P>

<HEAD>Generall con&s;iderations for the plantation in New England, with an an&s;wer to &s;everal objections.</HEAD>
<P>FIRST, it will be a &s;ervice to the church of great con|&s;equence, to carry the go&s;pell into tho&s;e parts of the world, and to rai&s;e a bulwarke again&s;t the kingdom of Antichri&s;t which the Je&s;uits labour to rear up in all places of the world.</P>
<P>Secondly, all other churches of Europe are brought to de&s;olation, and it may be ju&s;tly feared that the like judgment is coming upon us; and who knows but that God hath provided this place to be a refuge for many whom he meanes to &s;ave out of the general de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Thirdly, the land growes weary of her inhabitants, &s;o that man, which is the mo&s;t precious of all creatures, is here more vile and ba&s;e than the earth they tread upon; &s;o as children, neighbours and friends, e&s;pecially of the poore, are counted the greate&s;t burdens which, if things were right, would be the highe&s;t earthly ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>Fouthly. Wee are growen to that exce&s;s and intem|perance in all exce&s;s of riot as no meane e&s;tate almo&s;t will &s;uffice to keep &s;aile with his equals, and he that fayles in it mu&s;t live in &s;orrow and contempt. Hence it comes to pa&s;&s;e that all arts and trades are carried in that deceit|ful manner and unrighteous cour&s;e as it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for a good upright man to maintayne his chardge and live comfortably in any of them.</P>
<P>Fifthly. The &s;chools of learning and religion are &s;o corrupted, as (be&s;ides the un&s;upportable chardge of this education) mo&s;t children, (even the be&s;t wittie&s;t and of fayere&s;t hopes) are perverted, corrupted and utterly over powered by the multitude of evill examples and licentious governors of tho&s;e &s;eminaries.</P>
<P>Sixthly. The whole earth is the Lord's garden and hee hath given it to the &s;ons of Adam to bee tilled and improved by them, why then &s;hould we &s;tand &s;tarving
<PB N="28" REF="011300_0017_0F89727B7B74F280">
here for places of habitation (many men &s;pending as much labour and co&s;t to recover or keepe &s;ometymes an acre or two of lands, as would procure him many hun|dreds of acres, as good or better in another place) and in the meane tyme &s;uffer whole countryes as profitable for the u&s;e of man, to lye wa&s;te without any improvement?</P>
<P>Seventhly. What can bee a better worke and more no|ble and worthy a chri&s;tian, than to helpe to rai&s;e and &s;up|port a particular church while it is in its infancy, and to join our forces with &s;uch a company of faithfull peo|ple, as by a tymely a&s;&s;i&s;tance may grow &s;tronger and pro&s;|per, and for want of it may be put to great hazzard if not wholly ruined?</P>
<P>Eightly. If any &s;uch as are known to bee godly and live in wealth and pro&s;perity here, &s;hall for&s;ake all this to joyn them&s;elves with this church, and runne in hazard with them of hard and meane condition, it will be an ex|ample of great u&s;e both for the removing of &s;candall and &s;ini&s;ter and worldly re&s;pects, to give more lyfe to the faith of God's people in their prayers for the plantation and al&s;o to encourage others to joyne the more willingly in it.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="objections">
<HEAD>OBJECTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>Object. 1. It will be a great wrong to our owne church and country to take away the be&s;t people; and we &s;till lay it more open to the judgments feared.</P>
<P>An&s;. 1&s;t The number will be nothing in re&s;pect of tho&s;e that are left. 2dly, Many that live to no u&s;e here, more than for their own private familyes may bee employ|ed to a more common good in another place. 3dly, Such as are of good u&s;e here may yett be &s;o employed as the church &s;hall receive no lo&s;&s;e. And &s;ince Chri&s;t's coming the church is to be conceived as univer&s;all without di&s;|tinction of countryes, &s;o as he that doth good in any one place &s;erves the church in all places, in regard of the unitye. 4thly, It is the revealed will of God that the go&s;|pell &s;hould be preached to all nations, and though we know not whether the Indians will receive it or not, yet
<PB N="29" REF="011300_0017_0F89727B7B74F280">
it is a good worke to ob&s;erve God's will in offering it to them; for God &s;hall have glory by it though they re|fu&s;e it.</P>
<P>Obj. 2. Wee have feared a judgment a long tyme, but yet we are &s;afe; therefore it were better to &s;tay till it come, and either we may flie then, or if we be overtaken in it wee may well be content to &s;uffer with &s;uch a church as ours is.</P>
<P>An&s;. It is likely that this con&s;ideration made the churches beyond the &s;eas as the Palatinate and Rochel, &amp;c. to &s;it &s;till at home, and not look out for &s;helter while they might have found it, but the wofull &s;pectacle of their ruine may teach us more wi&s;dome to avoid the plague while it is fore&s;eene, and not to tarry as they did till it overtooke them. If they were now at their former liberty wee may be &s;ure they would take other cour&s;es for their &s;afety. And though mo&s;t of them had mi&s;carried in their e&s;cape, yet it had not been halfe &s;o mi&s;erable to them&s;elves, or &s;candalous to religion, as this de&s;perate back&s;liding and abjuring the truth, which many of the antient profe&s;&s;ors among them, and the whole po&s;terity that remayne are plunged into.</P>
<P>Obj. 3. Wee have here a fruitfull land with peace and plenty of all things.</P>
<P>An&s;. Wee are like to have as good conditions there in tyme; but yet we mu&s;t leave all this abundance, if it bee not taken from us. When we are in our graves, it will be all one whether we have lived in plenty or in penury, whether we have dyed in a bed of downe or lockes of &s;traw. Onely this is the advantage of the meane condi|tion, that it is a more freedom to dye. And the le&s;&s;e comfort any have in the things of this world, the more liberty they have to lay up trea&s;ure in heaven.</P>
<P>Obj. 4. Wee may peri&s;h by the way or when wee come there, having hunger or the &s;word, &amp;c. and how uncom|fortable will it be to &s;ee our wives and children and friends come to &s;uch mi&s;erie by our occa&s;ion?</P>

can &s;ecure him&s;elfe or his from the like calamities here? If this cour&s;e be warrantable, we may tru&s;t God's provi|dence for the&s;e things. Either he will keepe tho&s;e evils from us, or will di&s;po&s;e them for our good and enable us to beare them.</P>
<P>Obj. 5. But what warrant have we to take that land, which is and hath been of long tyme po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of others the &s;ons of Adam?</P>
<P>An&s;. That which is common to all is proper to none. This &s;avage people ruleth over many lands without title or property; for they inclo&s;e no ground, neither have they cattell to maintayne it, but remove their dwellings as they have occa&s;ion, or as they can prevail again&s;t their neighbours. And why may not chri&s;tians have liberty to go and dwell among&s;t them in their wa&s;te lands and woods (leaving them &s;uch places as they have manured for their corne) as lawfully as Abraham did among the Sodo|mites? For God hath given to the &s;ons of men a two-fould right to the earth; there is a naturall right and a civil right. The fir&s;t right was naturall when men held the earth in common, every man &s;owing and feeding where he plea&s;ed: Then, as men and cattell increa&s;ed, they ap|propriated &s;ome parcells of ground by enclo&s;ing and pe|culiar manurance, and this in tyme got them a civil right. Such was the right which Ephron the Hittite had to the field of Machpelah, wherein Abraham could not bury a dead corp&s;e without leave, though for the out parts of the countrey which lay common, he dwelt upon them and tooke the fruite of them at his plea&s;ure. This appears al&s;o in Jacob and his &s;ons, who fedd their flocks as bould|ly in the Canaanites land, for he is &s;aid to be lord of the country; and at Dotham and all other places men ac|counted nothing their owne, but that which they had ap|propriated by their own indu&s;try, as appears plainly by Abimelech's &s;ervants, who in their own countrey did often contend with I&s;aac's &s;ervants about wells which they had digged; but never about the lands which they occupied. So likewi&s;e betweene Jacob and Laban; he would not
<PB N="31" REF="011300_0018_0F89727C7AB85940">
take a kidd of Laban's without &s;peciall contract; but he makes no bargaine with him for the land where he fedd. And it is probable that if the countrey had not been as free for Jacob as for Laban, that covetuous wretch would have made his advantage of him, and have upbraided Jacob with it as he did with the re&s;t. 2dly, There is more than enough for them and us. 3dly, God hath con&s;umed the natives with a miraculous plague, whereby the greater part of the country is left voide of inhabitants. 4thly, We &s;hall come in with good leave of the natives.</P>
<P>Obj. 6. We &s;hould &s;end our young ones and &s;uch as can be&s;t be &s;pared, and not of the be&s;t of our mini&s;ters and magi&s;trates.</P>
<P>An&s;. It is a great worke, and requires more &s;kilfull ar|tificers to lay the foundation of a new building, than to uphold and repayre one that is already built. If great things be attempted by weake in&s;truments, the effects will be an&s;werable.</P>
<P>Obj. 7. Wee &s;ee that tho&s;e plantations that have been formerly made &s;ucceeded ill.</P>
<P>An&s;. The fruit of any public de&s;igne is not to be di&s;|cerned by the imediate &s;ucce&s;s: it may appear in tyme, that they were all to good u&s;e. 2dly, There were great fundamental errours in others, which are like to be avoid|ed in this: for 1&s;t there mayne end and purpo&s;e was car|nall and not religious. 2d, They aymed chiefly at profitt and not at the propagation of religion. 3d, They u&s;ed too unfitt in&s;truments, a multitude of rude and ungoverned per&s;ons, the very &s;cums of the land. 4th, They did not &s;tabli&s;h a right fourme of government.</P>

<P>A true relation of the la&s;t voyage to New England, made the la&s;t &s;ummer, begun the 25th of April, being Satur|day Anno Domini, 1629.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Company of New England, con&s;i&s;ting of many worthy gentlemen in the citty of London, Dor|ce&s;ter, and other places, ayming at the glory of God, the propagation of the go&s;pell of Chri&s;t, the con|ver&s;ion of the Indians, and the enlargement of the King's Maje&s;ty's dominions in America, and being authori&s;ed by his royal letters patents for that end, at their very great co&s;ts and charges, furni&s;hed 5 &s;hips to go to New England, for the further &s;ettling of the Engli&s;h plantation that they had already begun there.</P>
<P>The names of the 5 &s;hipps were as followeth.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is called the Talbot, a good and &s;trong &s;hip of 300 tunnes, and 19 pieces of ordinance, and &s;erved with 30 mariners. This &s;hip carried about an 100 planters, 6 goates, 5 great pieces of ordinance, with meale, oatemeale, pea&s;e, and all manner of munition and provi&s;ion for the plantation for a twelve monthe.</P>
<P>The &s;econd the George, another &s;trong &s;hip al&s;o, about 300 tunnes, 20 pieces of ordinance, &s;erved with about 30
<PB N="33" REF="011300_0019_0F89727CF4046BE8">
mariners; her chiefe carriage were cattell, 12 mares, 30 kyne, and &s;ome goates: Al&s;o there gad in her 52 planters and other provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>The third is called the Lyon's Whelpe, a neat and nim|ble &s;hip of 120 tunnes, 8 pieces of ordinance, carrying in her many mariners and about 40 planters, &s;pecially from Dorce&s;ter and other places thereabouts, with provi&s;ion, and 4 goats.</P>
<P>The 4th is called the Four Si&s;ters, as I heare, of about 300 tunns, which &s;ayme &s;hip carried many cattell, with pa&s;&s;engers and provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>The 5th is called the Mayflower, carrying pa&s;&s;engers and provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>Now among&s;t the&s;e 5 &s;hips, the George having the &s;pecial and urgent cau&s;e of ha&s;tening her pa&s;&s;age, &s;et &s;ayle before the re&s;t about the middle of April. And the Four Si&s;ters and the Mayflower, being not thoroughly furni&s;hed, intended, as we heard, to &s;et forth about 3 week after us: But we that were in the Talbot and the Lyon's Whelpe, being ready for our voyage, by the good hand of God's providence, hoy&s;ted our &s;ayle from Graves-end on Saturday the 25th of April, about 7 o'clock in the morning. Hav|ing but a faynt wynd we could not go farre that day, but at night we arrived again&s;t Leigh, which is 12 miles from Graves-end, and there we re&s;ted that night, and kept Sabbath the next day.</P>
<P>On Monday (the 27th) we &s;at forward and came to the flatts, a pa&s;&s;age &s;omewhat difficult by rea&s;on of the narrow|nes of the channel and &s;hallownes of the water; and going over this we were in &s;ome daunger: for the &s;hip being heavy laden and drawing deepe water was &s;en&s;ibly felt of us all to &s;trike 3 or 4 tymes on the ground: but the wind blowing &s;omewhat &s;trong we were carried &s;wiftly on, and at la&s;t by God's ble&s;&s;ing came &s;afe to ancre at Gorin roade.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day (28th) we went a little further, and ancred over again&s;t Margret downe, &s;taying for a wind for the Downes.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day (29th) we came &s;afely through with much turning and tacking thorow the gullies into the Downes, and &s;tayed that night.</P>

But &s;ayling with a good wind we went &s;peedily, and at night came neere the I&s;le of Wight, but being darke, we dur&s;t not put into the channell, but put backe for &s;ea-roome 4 houres, and then other 4 houres &s;ayled backe agayne the &s;ame way.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day (5th) early in the morning we entered the channell, the wind being weake and calme, and pa&s;&s;ed by Port&s;mouth very &s;lowly; but in the afternoone the wind quickened, and we were forced to ancre a little on this &s;ide Cowca&s;tle, but the wind growing more favourable, we weighed and came to ancre againe, right again&s;t Cow|ca&s;tle, thinking to &s;tay that night, the wind being very calme. Here I and my wiffe and my daughter Mary, and 2 maids, and &s;ome others with us, obtained of the ma&s;ter of the &s;hip to go a &s;hoare to refre&s;h us, and to wa&s;h our linnens, and &s;o we lay at Cowes that night. But the wind turning when we were ab&s;ent, they hoy&s;ted &s;ayle and left us there, and ancred 8 miles further, over again&s;t Yar|mouth, about 8 of the clocke at night.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day (6th) betyme in the morning the &s;halope was &s;ent from the &s;hip to fetch us to Yarmouth; but the water proved rough and our women de&s;ired to be &s;ett on &s;hoare 3 miles &s;hort of Yarmouth, and &s;o went on foote by land and lodged in Yarmouth that night.</P>

<P>Wedne&s;day (10th) the wind &s;till houlding ea&s;terly, we came as farre as the land's end, in the utmo&s;t part of Cornwall, and &s;o left our deare native &s;oyle of England behind us; and &s;ayling about 10 leagues further we pa&s;&s;ed the Iles of Scillic and launched the &s;ame day a great way into the maine ocean. And now my wiffe and other pa&s;|&s;engers began to feele the to&s;&s;ing waves of the we&s;terne &s;ea, and &s;o were very &s;ea &s;icke,</P>
<P>And this is to be noted, that all this while our pa&s;&s;age hath beene upon the coa&s;t of England, &s;o ought truly to be accounted the fir&s;t day of our parting with Ould England.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day (14th) the &s;ame ea&s;terly wind blew all day and night, and the next day (15th) &s;o that &s;ome of the &s;eamen thought we were come by this tyme 200 leagues from England, but toward night the wind was calme.</P>

<P>This day my two children Samuel and Mary began to be &s;icke of the &s;mall pocks and purples together, which was brought into the &s;hip by one Mr. Browne who was &s;icke of the &s;ame at Graves-end, whom it plea&s;ed God to make the fir&s;t occa&s;ion of bringing that contagious &s;icknes among us, wherewith many were after afflicted.</P>

And this day towards night my daughter grew &s;icker, and many blew &s;pots were &s;eene upon her brea&s;t, which affrighted us. At the fir&s;t we thought they had beene the plague tokens; but we found afterwards that it was only an high mea&s;ure of the infection of the pocks, which were &s;trucke agayne into the child, and &s;o it was God's will the child dyed about 5 of the clocke at night, being the fir&s;t in our &s;hip that was buried in the bowells of the great Atlantic &s;ea; which, as it was a griefe to us her parents and a terrrour to all the re&s;t, as being the beginning of a contagious di&s;ea&s;e and mortality, &s;o in the &s;ame judgment it plea&s;ed God to remember mercy in the child, in forcing it from a world of mi&s;ery wherein other|wi&s;e &s;he had lived all her daies.

For though there came a mighty &s;treame from the north yet it moved not, which made us &s;ound, and we found a banke of 40 fathom deepe where|upon we judged it to re&s;t: and the height above was as much. We &s;aw al&s;o 6 or 7 pieces of ice, floating on the &s;ea, which was broken off from the former mountayne. We al&s;o &s;aw great &s;tore of water fowle &s;wimming by the &s;hipp within mu&s;ket &s;hott, of a pyde colour and about the bigne&s;s of a wild duck, about 40 in a company. The mariners call them hag birds. Towards night came a fogge, that the Lions Whelp was lo&s;t till morning. And now we &s;aw many bony fi&s;h porpu&s;es and grampu&s;es every day more and more.</P>
<P>Fryday (12th) Foggie and calmi&s;h, the wind northerly in the morning, but about noon it came S. E. a dainty loome gale which carried us 6 leagues a watch.</P>
<P>Saturday (13th) the &s;ame wind till night, and we &s;aw great &s;tore of porpu&s;es and grampu&s;es.</P>
<P>The 5th &s;abbath, (14th) the &s;ame wind, towards noon it began to be foggie, and then it rained till night, we went 4 or 5 leagues a watch.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="011300_0023_0F89727FF52210E8">Monday (15th) a fayre day but foggie, the &s;ame wind blowing but with fre&s;h gales carried us 7 leagues a watch. In the afternoon it blew harder, &s;o the &s;ea was rough, and we lo&s;t the &s;ight of the Whelpe: it being foggie we drummed for them, and they &s;hot of a great piece of or|dinance, but we heared not one another.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day (16th) wind S. by E. foggie till about 10 a clocke. While we were at prayers it cleared up about an houre, and then we &s;aw the Lion's Whelpe, di&s;tant about 2 leagues &s;outhward, we pre&s;ently tackt about to meet her, and &s;he did the &s;ame to meet us, but before we could get together a thick fogge came, that we were long in finding each other. This day we &s;ounded divers tymes, and found our&s;elves on another banke, at fir&s;t 40 fathom, after 36, after 33, after 24. We thought it to have been the bank over again&s;t Cape Sable, but we were deceived, for we knew not certainly where we were becau&s;e of the fogge. After 3 or 4 hours company we lo&s;t the Lion's Whelpe agayne, and beate the drum and &s;hot of a great piece of ordinance, and yet heard not of them. But perceiving the banke to grow &s;till &s;hallower we found it 27 and 24 fa|thoms. Therefore, being a fogg, and fearing we were too neare land we tackt about for &s;ea-roome for 2 or 3 watches, and &s;teered &s;outhea&s;t.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day (17th) very foggie &s;till, and wind S. by W. and &s;ounding found no bottome that we could reach.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day (18th) wind full W. and contrary to us. This day a notorious wicked fellow that was given to &s;wering and boa&s;ting of his former wickednes, bragged that he had got a wench with child before he came this voyage, and mocked at our daies of fa&s;t, railing and je&s;ting again&s;t puritans, this fellow fell &s;ick of the pockes and dyed. We &s;ounded and found 38 fathom, and &s;tayed, for a little while, to take &s;ome cod fi&s;h, and fea&s;ted our&s;elves merrily.</P>
<P>Fryday (19th) wind We&s;t &s;till, a very fayre cleare day. About 4 a clock in the afternoone &s;ome went up to the top of the ma&s;t, and affirmed to our great comfort they &s;aw land to the northea&s;tward.</P>

<P>Sabbath (21&s;t) being the 6th Lord's day; wind norther|ly but fayre and calm.</P>
<P>Monday (22d) wind ea&s;terly, a fayre gale. This day we &s;aw a great deal of froth not farre from us: we feared it might be &s;ome breach of water again&s;t &s;ome rockes, therefore the ma&s;ter of our &s;hip hoi&s;ted out the &s;hal|lop and went with &s;ome of the men to &s;ee what it was; but found it onely to be a froath carried by the &s;treame.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day (23d) the wind N. E. a fayre gale.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day (24th) wind N. E. a fayre day and cleare; about 9 a clocke in the morning we e&s;pied a &s;hipp about 4 leagues behind us; which proved to be the Lions Whelpe, which had been a weeke &s;eperated from us, we &s;toped for her company. This day a child of good man Clarke, which had a con&s;umption before it came to &s;hipp, died. This day we had all a cleare and comfortable &s;ight of America, and of the Cape Sable that was over again&s;t us 7 or 8 leagues northward. Here we &s;aw yellow gilliflowers on the &s;ea.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day (25th) wind &s;till N. E. a full and fre&s;h gale. In the afternoon we had a cleare &s;ight of many i&s;lands and hills by the &s;ea &s;hoare. Now we &s;aw abundance of mack|rill, a great &s;tore of great whales puffing up water as they goe, &s;ome of them came neere our &s;hipp: this creature did a&s;toni&s;h us that &s;aw them not before; their back appeared like a little i&s;land. At 5 a clocke at night the wind turned S. E. a fayre gale. This day we caught mackrill.</P>
<P>Fryday (26th) a foggie morning, but after cleare and wind calme. We &s;aw many &s;cools of mackrill, infinite multitudes on every &s;ide our &s;hip. The &s;ea was abun|dantly &s;tored with rockweed and yellow flowers like gilly|flowers. By noon we were within 3 leagues of Capan, and as we &s;ayled along the coa&s;ts we &s;aw every hill and dale and every i&s;land full of gay woods and high trees. The nearer we came to the &s;hoare the more flowers in abundance, &s;ometymes &s;cattered abroad, &s;ometymes joyned

in &s;heets 9 or 10 yards long, which we &s;uppo&s;ed to be brought from the low meadowes by the tyde. Now what with fine woods and greene trees by land, and the&s;e yel|low flowers paynting the &s;ea, made us all de&s;irous to &s;ee our new paradi&s;e of New England, whence we &s;aw &s;uch forerunning &s;ignals of fertilitie afarre off. Coming neare the harbour towards night we takt about for &s;ea-roome.</P>
<P>Saturday (27th) a foggie morning; but after 8 o'clocke in the morning very cleare, the wind being &s;omewhat con|trary at So. and by We&s;t, we tackt to and againe with get|ting little; but with much adoe, about 4 o'clock in the afternoone, having with much payne compa&s;&s;ed the har|bour, and being ready to enter the &s;ame, &s;ee how things may &s;uddenly change! there came a fearfull gu&s;t of wind and rayne and thunder and lightning, whereby we were borne with no little terrour and trouble to our mariners, having very much adoe to loo&s;e downe the &s;ayles when the fury of the &s;torme held up. But God be prai&s;ed it la&s;ted but a while and &s;oone abated agayne, And hereby the Lord &s;hewed us what he could have done with us, if it had plea&s;ed him. But ble&s;&s;ed be God, he &s;oone removed this &s;torme and it was a fayre and &s;weet evening.</P>
<P>We had a we&s;terly wind which brought us between 5 and 6 o'clock to a fyne and &s;weet harbour, 7 miles from the head point of Capan. This harbour 20 &s;hips may ea&s;ily ryde therein, where there was an i&s;land whither four of our men with a boate went, and brought backe agayne ripe &s;trawberries and goo&s;eberries, and &s;weet &s;ingle ro&s;es. Thus God was merciful to us in giving us a ta&s;t and &s;mell of the &s;weet fruit as an earne&s;t of his bountiful goodnes to welcome us at our fir&s;t arrivall. This harbour was two leagues and &s;omething more from the harbour at Naim|kecke, where our &s;hips were to re&s;t, and the plantation is already begun. But becau&s;e the pa&s;&s;age is difficult and night drew on, we put into Capan habour.</P>
<P N="28">(28th) The Sabbath, being the fir&s;t we kept in Ame|rica, and the 7th Lord's day after we parted with England.</P>
<P>Monday (29th) we came from Capan, to go to Naim|kecke,

the wind northerly. I &s;hould have tould you before that the planters &s;pying our Engli&s;h colours the Governour &s;ent a &s;halop with 2 men on Saturday to pilot us. The&s;e re&s;ted the Sabbath with us at Capan; and this day, by God's ble&s;&s;ing and their directions, we pa&s;&s;ed the curious and difficult entrance into the large &s;pacious harbour of Naimkecke. And as we pa&s;&s;ed along it was wonderful to behould &s;o many i&s;lands repleni&s;hed with thicke wood and high trees, and many fayre greene pa&s;tures. And being come into the harbour we &s;aw the George to our great comfort then being come on Tue&s;day which was 7 daies before us. We re&s;ted that night with glad and thankful hearts that God had put an end to our long and tedious journey through the greate&s;t &s;ea in the world.</P>
<P>The next morning (30th) the governour came aboard to our &s;hip, and bade us kindly welcome, and invited me and my wiffe to come on &s;hoare, and take our lodging in his hou&s;e, which we did accordingly,</P>
<P>Thus you have a faithful report collected from day to day of all the particulars that were worth noting in our pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="remarkable things">
<HEAD>NOW in our pa&s;&s;age divers things are remarkeable.</HEAD>
<P>FIRST, through God's ble&s;&s;ing our pa&s;&s;age was &s;hort and &s;peedy, for whereas we had 1000 leagues, that is 3000 miles Engli&s;h, to &s;aile from Ould to New England, we performed the &s;ame in 6 weeks and 3 dayes.</P>
<P>Secondly, our pa&s;&s;age was comfortable and ea&s;ie for the mo&s;t part, having ordinarily fayre and moderate wind, and being freed for the mo&s;t part from &s;tormie and rough &s;eas, &s;aving one night only, which we that were not u&s;ed thought to be more terrible than indeed it was, and this was Wedne&s;day at night May 27th.</P>
<P>Thirdly, our pa&s;&s;age was al&s;o healthfull to our pa&s;&s;en|gers, being freed from the great contagion of the &s;curvie
<PB N="45" REF="011300_0025_0F897281725B9A00">
and other maledictions, which in other pa&s;&s;ages to other places had taken away the lives of many. And yet we were in all rea&s;on in wonderful danger all the way, our &s;hip being greatly crowded with pa&s;&s;engers; but through God's great goodne&s;s we had none that died of the pockes but that wicked fellow that &s;corned at fa&s;ting and prayer. There were indeed 2 little children, one of my owne and another be&s;ide; but I do not impute it meerely to the pa&s;|&s;age; for they were both very &s;ickly children, and not likely to have lived long, if they had not gone to &s;ea. And take this for a rule, if children be healthfull when they come to &s;ea, the younger they are the better they will endure the &s;ea, and are not troubled with &s;ea-&s;icknes as older people are, as we had experience in many children that went this voyage. My wiffe indeed, in to&s;&s;ing wea|ther, was &s;omething ill by vomiting, but in calme weather &s;he recovered agayne, and is now much better for the &s;ea &s;icknes. And for my owne part, whereas I have for di|vers yeares pa&s;t been very &s;ickly and ready to ca&s;t up what|&s;oever I have eaten, and was very &s;icke at London and Grave&s;end, yet from the tyme I came on &s;hipboard to this day, I have been &s;traungely healthfull. And now I can dige&s;t our &s;hip diett very well, which I could not when I was at land. And indeed in this regard I have great cau&s;e to give God prai&s;e, that he hath made my coming to be a method to cure me of a wonderful weake &s;tomacke and continual payne of melancholly wynd from the &s;plene: Al&s;o divers children were &s;icke of the &s;mall pockes, but are &s;afely recovered agayne, and 2 or 3 pa&s;&s;engers towards the latter end of the voyage fell &s;icke of the &s;curvie, but coming to land recovered in a &s;hort tyme.</P>
<P>Fourthly, our pa&s;&s;age was both plea&s;urable and profi|table. For we received in&s;truction and delight in behould|ing the wonders of the Lord in the deepe waters, and &s;ometimes &s;eeing the &s;ea round us appearing with a terrible countenance, and as it were full of high hills and deepe vallyes; and &s;ometimes it appeared as a mo&s;t plain and even meadow. And ever and anon we &s;aw divers kynds of
<PB N="46" REF="011300_0026_0F89728301D0FF10">
fi&s;hes &s;porting in the great waters, great grampu&s;es and huge whales going by companies and puffing up water-&s;treames. Tho&s;e that love their owne chimney corner, and dare not go farre beyond their owne townes end &s;hall neever have the honour to &s;ee the&s;e wonderfull workes of Almighty God.</P>
<P>Fifthly, we had a pious and chri&s;tian-like pa&s;&s;age; for I &s;uppo&s;e pa&s;&s;engers &s;hall &s;eldom find a company of more religious, hone&s;t and kynd &s;eamen than we had. We con|&s;tantly &s;erved God morning and evening by reading and expounding a chapter, &s;inging, and prayer. And the Sab|bath was &s;olemnely kept by adding to the former, preach|ing twi&s;e and catechi&s;ing. And in our great need we kept 2 &s;olemne fa&s;ts, and found a gracious effect. Let all that love and u&s;e fa&s;ting and praying take noti&s;e that it is as prevaileable by &s;ea as by land, where&s;oever it is faithfully performed. Be&s;ides the &s;hip ma&s;ter and his company u&s;ed every night to &s;ett their 8 and 12 a clocke watches with &s;inging a p&s;alme and prayer that was not read out of a booke. This I wryte not for boa&s;ting and flattery; but for the benefit of tho&s;e that have a mynd to come to New England hereafter, that if they looke for and de&s;yre to have as pro&s;perous a voyage as we had, they may u&s;e the &s;ame meanes to attayne the &s;ame. So letting pa&s;&s;e our pa&s;&s;age by &s;ea, we will now bring our di&s;cour&s;e to land on the &s;hoare of New England, and I &s;hall by God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance endeavour to &s;peake nothing but the naked truth, and both acquaint you with the commodities and di&s;commodities of the country.</P>

<P>NOW for the pre&s;ent condition of the plantation what it is. When we came fir&s;t to Naimkecke, now called Salem, we found about half a &s;core hou&s;es built: and a fayre

hou&s;e newly built for the governour, and we found al&s;o abundance of corne planted by them, excellent good and well liking. We brought with us about 200 pa&s;&s;engers and planters more, which now by common con&s;ent of all the ould planters are all now combyned together into one body politique under the &s;ame governor. There are with us in all ould and new planters 300, whereof 200 are &s;et|tled at Naimkecke, now called Salem, and the re&s;t plant them&s;elves at Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets bay, being to build a towne there called Charle&s;ton or Charle&s;towne; we that are &s;et|tled at Salem make what ha&s;te we can to build, &s;o that within a &s;hort tyme we &s;hall have a fayre towne. We have great ordnance whereof we doubt not but to fortifye our&s;elves in &s;hort tyme, to keepe out a potent adver&s;arye. But that which is our greate&s;t comfort and means of de|fence above all others, is, that we have here the true re|ligion and holy ordinances of almighty God among&s;t us. Thanks be to God we have plenty of preaching and dili|gent catechi&s;ing, with &s;trict and carefull exerci&s;e of good and commendable orders to bring our people to chri&s;tian conver&s;ation, which whil&s;t we do we doubt not but God will be with us, and &s;o Rom. 8.31. what &s;hall we then &s;ay to the&s;e things.

<HEAD>Some brief collections out of a letter that Mr. Higgin&s;on &s;ent to his friends at Leice&s;ter.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are certainly expected here the next &s;pring the coming of 60 familyes out of Dorcetter&s;hire, who have by letters &s;ignified &s;o much to the Governour to de&s;yre him to appoint them places of habitations; they bringing their mini&s;ters with them. Al&s;o many families are expected out of Lincoln&s;hire and a mini&s;ter with them, and a great company of godly chri&s;tians out of London. Such of you as come from Lei&s;ter, I would coun&s;ell you to come quickly, and that for two rea&s;ons. 1&s;t, if you lin|ger too long, the pa&s;&s;ages of Jordan through the malice of

Sathan may be &s;topped; that you can not come if you would. 2dly, Tho&s;e that come fir&s;t &s;peed be&s;t here, and have the priviledge of choo&s;ing choi&s;e places of habita|tions. Little children of 5 years ould may by &s;etting corne one month be able to get their owne maintenance abun|dantly. Oh what a good worke might you that are rich do for your poore brethren, to helpe them with your pur&s;es onely to convey them hither with their children and families, where they may live as well both for &s;oule and body as any where in the the world. Be&s;ides they will recompen&s;e the co&s;t by helping to build hou&s;es and plant your ground for a tyme; which &s;hall be difficult worke at the fir&s;t, except you have the helpe of many hands. Mr. John&s;on out of Lincoln&s;hire and many others have helped our godly chri&s;tians hither, to be employed in their worke for a while, and then to live of them|&s;elves. We have here about 40 goats that give milke, and as many milch kyne; we have 6 or 7 mares and an hor&s;e, and do every day expect the coming of half a &s;core mares more, and 30 kyne by two &s;hipps that are to follow us. They that come let them bring mares, kyne and &s;heepe as many as they can: Ireland is the be&s;t place to provide &s;heepe, and lyes in the way. Bring none that are in lambe, nor mares in foale; for they are in more dan|ger to peri&s;h at &s;ea. Of all trades carpenters are mo&s;t needful, therefore bring as many as you can. It were a wi&s;e cour&s;e for tho&s;e that are of abilityes to joyne toge|ther and buy a &s;hipp for the voyage and other merchan|dize. For the governor would that any man may em|ploy his &s;tocke in what merchandi&s;es he plea&s;e, excepting onely beaver &s;kins, which the company of merchants re|&s;erve to them&s;elves and the managing of the publique &s;tocke.

<P>No man hath or can have a hou&s;e built for him here unle&s;&s;e he comes him&s;elfe, or el&s;e &s;ends &s;eruants before to do it for him. It was an errour that I now perceive both in my&s;elfe, and others did conceive by not rightly under|&s;tanding the merchaunts meaning. For we thought that all that put in their money into the common &s;tocke &s;hould have a hou&s;e built for them, be&s;ides &s;uch a portion of land; but it was not &s;o. They &s;hall indeed have &s;o much land allotted to them when they come to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it and make u&s;e of it, but if they will have hou&s;es they mu&s;t build them. Indeed we that are mini&s;ters, and all the re&s;t that were entertained and &s;ent over and maintained by the re&s;t of the company, as their &s;ervants, for &s;uch a tyme in &s;uch employments, all &s;uch are to have hou&s;es built them of the companies charge and no others nor otherwi&s;e. They that put money into the &s;tocke, as they do a good worke to helpe forwards &s;o worthy a plantation, &s;o all the gayne they are like to have, is according to the increa&s;e of the &s;tocke at 3 yeares end, by the trade of beaver, be&s;ides the lands which they &s;hall enjoy when they will.</P>
<P>All that come mu&s;t have victualls with them for a twelve month, I meane they mu&s;t have meale, oatmeale and &s;uch like &s;u&s;tenaunce of food, till they can gett increa&s;e of corne by their owne labour. For, otherwi&s;e, &s;o many may come without provi&s;ion at the fir&s;t, as that our &s;mall beginnings may not be &s;ufficient to maintayne them.</P>
<P>Before you come be carefull to be &s;trongly in&s;tructed what things are fitte&s;t to bring with you for your more comfortable pa&s;&s;age at &s;ea, as al&s;o for your hu&s;bandrey oc|ca&s;ions when you come to the land. For when you are once parted with England you &s;hall meete neither with taverns nor alehou&s;e, nor butchers, nor gro&s;ers, nor apo|thecaries &s;hops to helpe what things you need, in the mid&s;t of the great ocean, nor when you are come to land, here

are yet neither markets nor fayres to buy what you want. Therefore be &s;ure to furni&s;h your&s;elves with things fitting to be had before you come; as meale for bread, malt for drinke, woollen and linnen cloath, and leather for &s;hoes, and all manner of carpenters tooles, and a good deale of iron and &s;teele to make nailes, and lockes for hou&s;es and furniture for ploughs and carts, and gla&s;&s;e for windowes, and many other things which were better for you to think of them there than to want them here.</P>

<P>WHEREAS his Maje&s;ty hath lately been informed of great di&s;traction and much di&s;order in the planta|tions in the parts of America called New-England, which if they be true, and &s;uffered to run on, would tend to the di&s;honour of this kingdom, and utter ruine of the planta|tion: for prevention whereof, and for the orderly &s;etling of government, according to the intentions of tho&s;e patents which have been granted by his Maje&s;ty and from his late royal father king James, it hath plea&s;ed his Maje&s;ty that the Lords and others of his mo&s;t honorable Privy Council &s;hould take the &s;ame into con&s;ideration. Their Lord&s;hips in the fir&s;t place thought fitt to make a committee of this Board to take examinations of the matters informed.

my &s;alvation: How&s;oever God dealt otherwi&s;e with my co&s;igne Suckey, and which might give unto &s;ome whom it nearly concerned a &s;ea&s;onable adverti&s;ement, yet I am per|&s;waded it was in much faithfulne&s;&s;e to hir, that God took her away to prevent the di&s;quietne&s;&s;e and di&s;couragement of her &s;pirit, which the evills en&s;ueinge, evills ha&s;teninge upon the towne, would have brought upon hir: The Lord is wi&s;e and gracious, and knoweth how to deliver his, out of the houre of temptation; ble&s;&s;ed for ever be his name in Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The que&s;tions you demand, I had rather an&s;wer by word of mouth, than by letter, yet I will not refu&s;e to give you account of my brother Hookers removall and mine owne, &s;einge you require a rea&s;on thereof from us both. We both of us concurre in a 3 fold ground of re|moval. 1. God havinge &s;hut a doore again&s;t both of us from mini&s;tringe to him and his people in our wonted con|gregations, and calling us by a remnant of our people, and by others of this countrye to mini&s;ter to them here, and opening a dore to us this way, who are we that we &s;hould &s;trive again&s;t God and refu&s;e to follow the concurrence of his ordinance and providence together, callinge us forth to mini&s;ter here. If we may and ought to follow Gods callinge 3 hundred myles, why not 3 thou&s;and? 2. Our Saviors war|rant is in our ca&s;e, that when we are di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in our cour&s;e in one country (nequid dicam gravius) we &s;hould flee to another. To choo&s;e rather to bear witnes to the truth by impri&s;onment than by bani&s;hment, is indeede &s;ometimes Gods way, but not in ca&s;e men have ability of body and op|portunity to remove, and no nece&s;&s;ary engagement for to &s;tay. Whil&s;t Peter was young he might gird him&s;elfe and goe wither he would, Joh. 21.8. but when he was old and unfitt for traveyle, then indeed God called him rather to &s;uffer him&s;elfe to be girt of others, and led along to pri&s;on, and to death. Nevertheles in this point I conferred with the chefe of our people, and offered them to beare witnes to the truth I had preached, and practi&s;ed among&s;t them
<PB N="56" REF="011300_0031_0F897286B3F1B2F0">
even unto bonds, if they conceived it might be any confir|mation to their fayth and patience; but they di&s;waded me that cour&s;e, as thinking it better for them&s;elves, and for me, and for the church of God, to withdraw my &s;elfe from the pre&s;ent &s;torme, and to mini&s;ter in this country to &s;uch of their towne as they had &s;ent before hither, and &s;uch others as were willinge to goe alonge with me, or to follow after me; the mo&s;t of the  <GAP DESC="blank">  choo&s;ing rather to dwell in the [obliterated]
there. What &s;ervice my &s;elfe, and brother Hooker might doe to our people or other bretheren in pri&s;on (e&s;pecially in clo&s;e pri&s;on which was feared) I &s;uppo&s;e we both of us (by Gods helpe) doe the &s;ame, and much more, and with more freedom from hence, as occa&s;ion is offered: Be&s;ides all our other &s;ervice to the people here, which yett is enough, and more than enough to fill both our handes, yea and the hands of many brethren more, &s;uch as your &s;elfe, &s;hould God be plea&s;ed to make way for your comfortable pa&s;&s;age to us. To have tarryed in England for the end you mention, to appear in defence of that cau&s;e for which we were que&s;tioned, had been (as we conceyve it in our ca&s;e) to limitt witne&s;&s;e-bearing to the cau&s;e (which may be done more ways than one) to one onely way, and that &s;uch a way as we doe not &s;ee God callinge us unto. Did not Paul beare witne&s;&s;e again&s;t the Levitical ceremonyes, and yett choo&s;e rather to depart quickly out of Hieru&s;alem, becau&s;e the mo&s;t of the Jews would not receyve his te&s;timony concerninge Chri&s;t in that que&s;tion (Acts 22.18.) than to &s;tay at Hieru&s;alem to bear witne&s;&s;e to that cau&s;e unto pri&s;on and death? Not that we came hither to &s;trive again&s;t ceremonyes (or to fight again&s;t &s;hadowes) there is noe neede of our further labor in that cour&s;e; our people here de&s;ire to wor&s;hip God in &s;pirit and in truth, and our people left in England know as well the groundes and rea&s;ons of our &s;uffering again&s;t the&s;e things, as our &s;ufferings them&s;elves, which we be&s;eech the Lord to accept and ble&s;&s;e, in our ble&s;&s;ed Savior. How
<PB N="57" REF="011300_0031_0F897286B3F1B2F0">
farre our te&s;timony there hath prevayled with any others, to &s;earch more &s;eriou&s;lye into the cau&s;e, we doe rather ob|&s;erve in thankfullne&s;&s;e and &s;ilence, than &s;peake of to the prejudice of our bretheren.</P>
<P N="3">3. It hath been noe &s;mall inducement to us, to choo&s;e rather to remove hither, than to &s;tay there, that we might enjoy the libertye, not of &s;ome ordinances of God, but of all, and all in purity. For though we ble&s;&s;e the Lord with you for the gracious meanes of &s;alvation, which many of your congregations doe enjoy (whereof our owne &s;oules have founde the ble&s;&s;inge, and which we de&s;ire may be for ever continued, and enlarged to you) yet &s;eeing Chri&s;t hath in&s;tituted no ordinance in vayne (but all to the of|ferringe of the body of Chri&s;t) and we know that our &s;oules &s;tand in neede of all to the uttmo&s;t, we dur&s;t not &s;o farre be wanting to the grace of Chri&s;t, and to the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of our owne &s;oules, as to &s;itt downe &s;ome where el&s;e, under the &s;hadowe of &s;ome ordinances, when by two monthes travayle we might come to enjoy the libertie of all.</P>
<P>To your 2d que&s;tion, how farre mini&s;ters are bound to beare wittne&s;&s;e again&s;t corruptions ca&s;t upon the face of Gods ordinances, it is too large a point for me to give an&s;wer to in the heele of a letter. But thus much briefly, wittnes is to be borne again&s;t corruptions. 1. By keeping a mans owne garments cleane; I meane his owne outward practice. Rev. 16.15. 2. By declaringe the whole coun|&s;ell of God to his people, not &s;hunninge any part of it, as rea&s;onable occa&s;ion is offered, to prevent &s;inne in them. Acts 20.26.27. 3. By avoyding appearances of evill, as well as evill it &s;elfe. 1 The&s;&s;. 5.22. Eleazerus dur&s;t not eate mutton, or bread, or any other cleane foode, when it had an appearance of eateing &s;wines fle&s;h, but cho&s;e death rather than deliverance by &s;uch meanes. 2 Maccab. cap. 6. ver. 21. to 25. who&s;e &s;tory though it be apochry|phall, yet the example authenticall, as being ratifyed by the apo&s;tles te&s;timonie among&s;t the re&s;t of like nature. Heb. 11.35. where by the others he &s;peaketh of he meaneth not other women, but other men, for the word is <GAP DESC="foreign">
<PB N="58" REF="011300_0032_0F897287743A1248">
ma&s;culine. How&s;oever, Peters di&s;&s;emblinge is evidently blamed by Paul in a like ca&s;e, when by his example he countenanced the impo&s;inge of ceremonyes upon the Gen|tiles, to whom God never gave them. Gal. 2.11. to 14.4. By contendinge for the truth in an holy manner, when others contend with us again&s;t it. Jude 3.4. By givinge account of our fayth before magi&s;trates, if they call us to it publiquely, requireing to be informed of our doctrine and manner of life. 1 Pet. 3.15. Otherwi&s;e, if they call us to knowe our opinions in private (intending to bringe us into trouble) or publiquely, rather as captions que&s;tio|ni&s;ts than judiciall governors, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, I &s;uppo&s;e we may conceale our mindes, and put our adver&s;aryes upon proofe, as our Savior did, John 18.19, 20, 21. But why doe I &s;pend time and wordes to you in the&s;e thinges, who know them as well as I can tell you, I rather de&s;ire you may be kept in a peaeable way of bearinge wittne&s;&s;e to the truth (if the will of God be &s;uch) than expo&s;ed to hazards by &s;uch confe&s;&s;ions as mighte prejudice your liberty. My poore reque&s;ts are to heaven for you, as I de&s;ire you might not forgett me and mine, and all us here. Now the God of peace and power guide and &s;upport your &s;pirit, in all your holy endeavours, ble&s;&s;e and pro&s;per your labors, and keepe you as a cho&s;en ve&s;&s;ell in the &s;hadowe of his hande, through him that hath loved us.</P>

the relation wholly, &s;eeing a lively voyce will do it: and therefore I entreat your favour for this omi&s;&s;ion; &s;pecially becau&s;e it is late in the night and a faire wind attends us. Surely there have been &s;o many &s;ingular providences as are worthy of due ob&s;ervance and eternall pray&s;e.

<HEAD>Libertye and the Weale Publick reconciled: In a briefe and cleare declaration of the mi&s;|apprehen&s;ion of &s;ome grieved mindes concern|inge the lawfull and orderly proceedings of the late Court of Elections at Newtown, the 17th of the 3d month, 1637.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Hi&s;tory Vol. I p. 61.</NOTE></HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The complaint is, that the peoples libertye was re&s;trained, by &s;uch as with&s;tood the reading of a petition ten|dered before the elections made.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>FOR clearing hereof it is to be con&s;idered, 1. What the libertye is which they de&s;ire to have pre&s;erved: That I take to be this, viz. That the people may not be &s;ubjected to any lawe or power amonge them&s;elves with|out their con&s;ent; what&s;oever is more than this, is neither lawfull nor durable, and in&s;tead of libertye may prove bondage or licentiou&s;ne&s;&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. If this libertye be at any tyme re&s;trayned by the people them&s;elves, they are guilty of their owne harme; if any be.</P>
<P N="3">3. If &s;uch re&s;traint be not redre&s;&s;ed, upon any &s;ea&s;ona|ble opportunity, when lawfully it may, they can blame none &s;o much as them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="4">4. That the power of a popular &s;tate being unlimited in its owne nature, and being by free con&s;ent and wi&s;e
<PB N="64" REF="011300_0035_0F89728A79239FE0">
advi&s;e, brought into a methode; and &s;o bounded, in order onely, not in power, it is more &s;afe to be &s;o continued and exerci&s;ed (though with offence or perhaps damage to &s;ome particulars in &s;ome tran&s;ient ca&s;es, the original power re|maining &s;till inviolate) than to be putt out of its &s;ettled cour&s;e, upon every pretence, or occa&s;ion, of publick grie|vance: &s;eeing every deviation in the verye forme of any &s;uch government is allways attended with much trouble, and &s;ome danger.</P>
<P>An&s;w. If we examine the pa&s;&s;ages of the court, we &s;hall &s;ee where the error was.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable that the proper bu&s;ine&s;s of this court was matter of election, and it is al&s;o obviou&s;e, that it hath obtained, by cu&s;tom, the fir&s;t place in that day (except ad|mi&s;&s;ion of freemen) and where it was objected, that in the court 1635, the petition in Mr. Endecotts ca&s;e, was heard and an&s;wered before election: It is not true: For I can &s;hew by that which hath been faithfully kept of the pa&s;|&s;ages of that court, among other, that all petitions were rejected till the elections were pa&s;&s;ed; and many can re|member, that when that ca&s;e was heard, Mr. Heynes &s;ate governour, who had been elected that court.</P>
<P>It is objected againe, that the court might yet have heard the petition fir&s;t, and &s;eeing it was for the peoples libertye, why was it &s;topped? To this it may be an&s;wered, that it is true, they might, if they had &s;o plea&s;ed: But fir&s;t they would not, and their refu&s;al was lawfull upon the&s;e rea&s;ons.</P>
<P N="1">1. It had been no point of wi&s;dom to break order, without pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ity, or for &s;ome prevalent advantage, neither of which could the court then apprehend.</P>
<P N="2">2. When the que&s;tion was, whether petition or election &s;hould be fir&s;t, 1 one could give an&s;wer there, but the court it &s;elfe, which was the whole bodye of freemen (for none of the magi&s;trates had any more influence in that court than any other freeman) &s;o as here was no other way to knowe the minde of the court but by putting it to vote, and by numbering either &s;ide, to decide the que&s;tion; this
<PB N="65" REF="011300_0035_0F89728A79239FE0">
was done, and the major part being for election, it may truely be &s;ayde, that the people or the court did order that election &s;hould proceed before the petition &s;hould be heard: And now let any wi&s;e man judge, who hath done the people wronge, or what re&s;traint hath been putt upon their liberty. For if the people would have had the peti|tion fir&s;t heard, who could have judged it, or what expo|&s;ition did any make again&s;t it, otherwi&s;e than is lawfull for any freeman to doe, by &s;hewing his di&s;like and giving rea&s;on for it?</P>
<P>If it be objected, that a great parte of the people did not con&s;ent: I an&s;wer, there was not one freeman there but his con&s;ent was to it: for it is an in&s;epparable inci|dent to all bodyes politick, which are compo&s;ed of volun|tary members, that every one (in his admi&s;&s;ion) gives an implicite con&s;ent to what&s;oever the maior parte &s;hall e&s;tabli&s;he, not being again&s;t religion or the weale publick, and this they are further bound unto by their oathe: yea if the oath be di&s;putable, yet their con&s;ent is in it, till it be cleared, and the error of the maior part convinced by plain arguments: otherwi&s;e no &s;uch &s;ocietye would long &s;ub|&s;i&s;t: neither could peace be at all pre&s;erved in it; for it is hardly po&s;&s;ible, to e&s;tabli&s;he any thinge (except of indiffe|rent nature) that &s;hall plea&s;e every man: and if one or more in any &s;ociety may be at libertye, when the re&s;t are re&s;trayned, it can neither be equal nor &s;afe.</P>
<P N="3">3. It had been meere inju&s;tice, for the people then a&s;&s;embled to have concluded any publick bu&s;ine&s;&s;e by po|pular vote. The rea&s;on is apparent. Becau&s;e tho&s;e towns, which by lawful order, upon publick con&s;iderations, &s;ent their proxies for elections, and their deputyes for other affaires, had been iniuriou&s;ly &s;urprized, and deprived of their due intere&s;t to di&s;cerne of tho&s;e things, which did no le&s;s concerne them than the re&s;t who were pre&s;ent. And upon this grounde, what&s;oever the freemen then pre&s;ent had concluded had been meerely voide and no man bound to &s;ubmit to it: for, be&s;ides the manife&s;t iniurye to &s;uch as had been &s;o unduly kept awaye, it might have fallen out,
<PB N="66" REF="011300_0036_0F89728B75195E58">
that, beinge pre&s;ent, they might have given &s;uch rea&s;ons as might have altered the judgment of the re&s;t of the court.</P>
<P N="4">4. If the petition had contained any matter of grievance which had nece&s;&s;arily required the helpe of the people to redre&s;&s;e it (as in &s;ome ca&s;es it may fall out) yet why this might not as well have been done after the election as be|fore doth not appeare: for the people mu&s;t have &s;tayed as long tyme, for di&s;patch of bothe, which&s;oever had fir&s;t been handled, petitions or elections: And if they had unadvi&s;edly elected any unworthy per&s;on, they might &s;oone have removed him: and the ju&s;t di&s;grace upon &s;uch an one had more than recompenced the &s;hort tyme it would have required.</P>
<P N="5">5. So the generall court at Bo&s;ton, in the 3. mo. 1634, when the people e&s;tabli&s;hed a reformation of &s;uch things as they judged to be ami&s;&s;e in the government, they then &s;ettled an order, that in the court of elections they &s;hould leeve their deputyes to manage all other affaires.</P>
<P N="6">6. It is verye difficult and dangerous for &s;o great a people and of &s;o different apprehen&s;ions, to give judg|ment in a cau&s;e of right or wronge, being &s;uddainly di&s;|covered to them: and if we &s;hould growe to &s;uch a mul|titude as (through Gods ble&s;&s;ing) we may &s;oone be, it will be impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be well carried.</P>
<P N="7">7. It is ea&s;ye to judge, that 30 or 40 di&s;tinct men, cho&s;en out of all the countrye, and by all rea&s;on as free from partialitye or preiudice as any other, may give a more ju&s;t &s;entence in any &s;uch cau&s;e (upon deliberation and quiet di&s;cour&s;e) than a whole multitude upon the &s;uddaine, when many may be thought not to heare what is propo&s;ed, and others not to under&s;tand it, and perchance the greater part in a heate and tumult, and when the weake&s;t and wor&s;t member of the common-wealth adds as much weight to the &s;entence as the mo&s;t godly and judicious.</P>
<P N="8">8. The people (in the &s;aid court 1634) having (by &s;earious advice of &s;uch as they be&s;t knew, and that &s;eem|ed to be much lovers of their libertye) given power to their deputyes, for future tyme, to doe what&s;oever them|&s;elves
<PB N="67" REF="011300_0036_0F89728B75195E58">
might (&s;ave in matters of elections) order requires they &s;hould fir&s;t referre the redre&s;&s;e of their grievances to their deputyes, and the people not to entermeddle, except the deputyes &s;hould fir&s;t fayle, and that apparently and previou&s;ly: which is &s;eldom like to fall out in a popular &s;tate, where nothing but force can deprive them of their libertye, except they &s;hall wittinglye and willinglye give them away, and then <HI>volunti non fit injuria,</HI> a man cannot blame another for the harme he does to him&s;elfe.</P>

<HEAD>A Defence of an Order of Court made in the Year 1637.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A Declaration of the Intent and Equitye of the Order made at the la&s;t Court, to this effect, that none &s;hould be received to inhabite within this Juri&s;diction but &s;uch as &s;hould be allowed by &s;ome of the Magi&s;trates.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Defence and the Replication are undoubtedly the Per|formances of Mr. Winthrop. The An&s;wer is by Mr. Vane, afterwards Sir H&punc; Vane. I leave the Reader to judge who had the be&s;t cau&s;e and who be&s;t defended it. See <HI>Ma&s;&s;. Hi&s;t. Vol. I. p.</HI> 62.</NOTE></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>FOR clearing of &s;uch &s;cruples as have ari&s;en about this order, it is to be con&s;idered, fir&s;t, what is the e&s;&s;entiall forme of a common weale or body politic &s;uch as this is, which I conceive to be this&mdash;The con&s;ent of a certaine companie of people, to cohabite together, under one go|vernment for their mutual &s;afety and welfare.</P>
<P>In this de&s;cription all the&s;e things doe concurre to the well being of &s;uch a body, 1 Per&s;ons, 2 Place, 3 Con&s;ent, 4 Government or Order, 5 Wellfare.</P>
<P>It is clearely agreed, by all, that the care of &s;afety and wellfare was the original cau&s;e or occa&s;ion of common weales and of many familyes &s;ubjecting them&s;elves to rulers and laws; for no man hath lawfull power over ano|ther, but by birth or con&s;ent, &s;o likewi&s;e, by the law of proprietye, no man can have ju&s;t intere&s;t in that which be|longeth to another, without his con&s;ent.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="011300_0037_0F89728BF3A8C310">From the premi&s;es will ari&s;e the&s;e conclu&s;ions.</P>
<P N="1">1. No common weale can be founded but by free con&s;ent.</P>
<P N="2">2. The per&s;ons &s;o incorporating have a public and re|lative intere&s;t each in other, and in the place of their co|habitation and goods, and laws, &amp;c. and in all the means of their wellfare &s;o as none other can claime priviledge with them but by free con&s;ent.</P>
<P N="3">3. The nature of &s;uch an incorporation tyes every member thereof to &s;eeke out and entertaine all means that may conduce to the wellfare of the bodye, and to keepe off what&s;oever doth appeare to tend to theire damage.</P>
<P N="4">4. The wellfare of the whole is to be put to apparent hazard for the advantage of any particular members.</P>
<P>From the&s;e conclu&s;ions I thus rea&s;on.</P>
<P N="1">1. If we heere be a corporation e&s;tabli&s;hed by free con&s;ent, if the place of our cohabitation be our owne, then no man hath right to come into us &amp;c. without our con&s;ent.</P>
<P N="2">2. If no man hath right to our lands, our government priviledges, &amp;c. but by our con&s;ent, then it is rea&s;on we &s;hould take notice of before we conferre any &s;uch upon them.</P>
<P N="3">3. If we are bound to keepe off what&s;oever appears to tend to our ruine or damage, then may we lawfully refu&s;e to receive &s;uch who&s;e di&s;po&s;itions &s;uite not with ours and who&s;e &s;ociety (we know) will be hurtfull to us, and there|fore it is lawfull to take knowledge of all men before we receive them.</P>
<P N="4">4. The churches take liberty (as lawfully they may) to receive or reject at their di&s;cretion; yea particular towns make orders to the like effect; why then &s;hould the com|mon weale be denied the like liberty and the whole more re&s;trained than any parte?</P>
<P N="5">5. If it be &s;inne in us to deny &s;ome men place &amp;c. a|mong us, then it is becau&s;e of &s;ome right they have to this place &amp;c. for to deny a man that which he hath no right unto is neither &s;inne nor injury.</P>
<P N="6">6. If &s;trangers have right to our hou&s;es or lands, &amp;c. then it is either of ju&s;tice or of mercye; if of ju&s;tice let them plead it, and we &s;hall know what to an&s;wer: but if
<PB N="69" REF="011300_0037_0F89728BF3A8C310">
it be only in way of mercye, or by the rule of ho&s;pitality, &amp;c. then I an&s;wer 1&s;t, A man is not a fit object of mercye except he be in mi&s;erye. 2d, We are not bound to exer|ci&s;e mercye to others to the ruine of our&s;elves. 3d, There are few that &s;tand in neede of mercye at theire fir&s;t com|ing hither. As for ho&s;pitality, that rule doth not bind fur|ther than for &s;ome pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, not for continual re|&s;idence.</P>
<P N="7">7. A family is a little common wealth, and a common wealth is a greate family. Now as a family is not bound to entertaine all comers, no not every good man (otherwi&s;e than by way of ho&s;pitality) no more is a common wealth.</P>
<P N="8">8. It is a generall received rule, <HI>turpius ejicitur quam non admittitur ho&s;pes,</HI> it is wor&s;e to receive a man whom we mu&s;t ca&s;t out againe, than to denye him admittance.</P>
<P N="9">9. The rule of the Apo&s;tle, John 2.10. is, that &s;uch as come and bring not the true doctrine with them &s;hould not be received to hou&s;e, and by the &s;ame rea&s;on not into the common weale.</P>
<P N="10">10. Seeing it mu&s;t be granted that there may come &s;uch per&s;ons (&s;uppo&s;e Je&s;uits, &amp;c.) which by con&s;ent of all ought to be rejected, it will follow that this law (being only for notice to be taken of all that come to us, without which we cannot avoyd &s;uch as indeed are to be kept out) is no other but ju&s;t and needfull, and if any &s;hould be rejected that ought to be received, that is not to be imputed to the law, but to tho&s;e who are betru&s;ted with the execution of it. And herein is to be con&s;idered, what the intent of the law is, and by con&s;equence, by what rule they are to walke, who are betru&s;ted with the keeping of it. The intent of the law is to pre&s;erve the wellfare of the body; and for this ende to have none received into any fellow&s;hip with it who are likely to di&s;turbe the &s;ame, and this intent (I am &s;ure) is lawful and good. Now then, if &s;uch to whom the keeping of this law is committed, be per&s;uaded in theire judgments that &s;uch a man is likely to di&s;turbe and hinder the publick weale, but &s;ome others who are not in the &s;ame tru&s;t, judge otherwi&s;e, yet they are to
<PB N="70" REF="011300_0038_0F89728CB2D0ED28">
follow theire owne judgments, rather then the judgments of others who are not alike intere&s;ted: As in tryall of an offender by a jury; the twelve men are &s;atisfied in their con&s;ciences, upon the evidence given, that the party de|&s;erves death: but there are 20 or 40 &s;tanders by, who conceive otherwi&s;e, yet is the jury bound to condemn him according to their owne con&s;ciences, and not to acquit him upon the different opinion of other men, except theire rea|&s;ons can convince them of the errour of theire con&s;ciences, and this is according to the rule of the Apo&s;tle, Rom. 14.5. Let every man be fully per&s;uaded in his own mynde.</P>
<P>If it be objected, that &s;ome prophane per&s;ons are received and others who are religious are rejected, I an&s;wer 1&s;t, It is not knowne that any &s;uch thinge hath as yet fallen out. 2, Such a practice may be ju&s;tifiable as the ca&s;e may be, for younger per&s;ons (even prophane ones) may be of le&s;&s;e danger to the common weale (and to the churches al&s;o) than &s;ome older per&s;ons, though profe&s;&s;ors of religion: for our Saviour Chri&s;t when he conver&s;ed with publicans, &amp;c. &s;ayth that &s;uch were nearer the kingdom of heaven than the religious phari&s;ees, and one that is of large parts and confirmed in &s;ome erronious way, is likely to doe more harme to church and common weale, and is of le&s;&s;e hope to be reclaymed, then 10 prophane per&s;ons, who have not yet beene hardened, in the contempt of the meanes of grace.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, Whereas it is objected that by this law, we re|ject good chri&s;tians and &s;o con&s;equently Chri&s;t him&s;elfe: I an&s;wer 1&s;t, It is not knowne that any chri&s;tian man hath beene rejected. 2, A man that is a true chri&s;tian, may be denyed re&s;idence among us, in &s;ome ca&s;es, without reject|ing Chri&s;t, as admitt a true chri&s;tian &s;hould come over, and &s;hould maintaine community of goods, or that magi&s;|trates ought not to puni&s;h the breakers of the fir&s;t table, or the members of churches for criminal offences: or that no man were bound to be &s;ubject to tho&s;e lawes or magi&s;|trates to which they &s;hould not give an explicite con&s;ent, &amp;c. I hope no man will &s;ay, that not to receive &s;uch an one, were to reject Chri&s;t; for &s;uch opinions (though being
<PB N="71" REF="011300_0038_0F89728CB2D0ED28">
maintained in &s;imple ignorance, they might &s;tand with a &s;tate of grace yet) they may be &s;o dangerous to the pub|lick weale in many re&s;pects, as it would be our &s;inne and unfaithfullne&s;s to receive &s;uch among us, except it were for tryall of theire reformation, I would demand then in the ca&s;e in que&s;tion (for it is bootele&s;&s;e curio&s;ity to re|frayne opene&s;&s;e in things publick) whereas it is &s;ayd that this law was made of purpo&s;e to keepe away &s;uch as are of Mr Wheelwright his judgment (admitt it were &s;o which yet I cannot confe&s;&s;e) where is the evill of it? If we conceive and finde by &s;add experience that his opi|nions are &s;uch, as by his own profe&s;&s;ion cannot &s;tand with externall peace, may we not provide for our peace, by keeping of &s;uch as would &s;trengthen him, and infect others with &s;uch dangerous tenets? and if we finde his opinions &s;uch as will cau&s;e divi&s;ions, and make people looke at their magi&s;trates, mini&s;ters and brethren as enemies to Chri&s;t and Antichri&s;ts, &amp;c. were it not &s;inne and unfaithfullne&s;s in us, to receive more of tho&s;e opinions, which we all|ready finde the evill fruite of: Nay, why doe not tho&s;e who now complayne joyne with us in keeping out of &s;uch, as well as formerly they did in expelling Mr. Williams for the like, though le&s;&s;e dangerous? Where this change of theire judgments &s;hould ari&s;e I leave to them&s;elves to examine, and I earne&s;tly entreate them &s;o to doe, and for this law let the equally mynded judge, what evill they finde in it, or in the practice of tho&s;e who are betru&s;ted with the execution of it.</P>

<P>For the ground worke which is layde in the fir&s;t place; it con&s;i&s;ts partly of a de&s;cription of a common wealth, which in &s;ome &s;ort is explycated, and partly of diver&s;e conclu&s;ions ari&s;eing from &s;uch de&s;cription and explication.</P>
<P>The de&s;cription which is &s;ett downe in effect is this. A common-wealth is a certaine companie of people con|&s;enting to cohabit together under one government, for their mutual &s;afetye and wellfare. In which de&s;cription this maine faulte is founde. At the be&s;t it is but a de&s;crip|tion of a common-wealth at large, and not of &s;uch a com|mon-wealth as this (as is &s;aid) which is not only chri&s;tian but dependant upon the grante al&s;o of our Souveraigne; for &s;o are the expre&s;&s;e words of that order of court to which the whole countrey was required to &s;ub&s;cribe.</P>
<P>Now if you will define a chri&s;tian common-wealth, there mu&s;t be put in; &s;uch a con&s;ent as is according to God;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov 8.5. I&s;ai. 6.7.</NOTE> a &s;ubjecting to &s;uch a government as is ac|cording unto Chri&s;t. And if you will define a corporation, incorporated by vertue of the grante of our Souveraigne, it mu&s;t be &s;uch a con&s;ent as the grante re|quires and permitts and in that manner and forme as it pre&s;cribes, or el&s;e it will be defective. The common-wealth here de&s;cribed, may be a companye of Turki&s;h pirates as well as Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ors, unle&s;&s;e the con&s;ent and go|vernment be better limitted than it is in this definition; for &s;ure it is, all Pagans and Infidels, even the Indians here among&s;t us, may come within this compa&s;&s;e. And is this &s;uch a body politicke as ours, as you &s;ay? God forbid. Our common-wealth we feare would be twi&s;e mi&s;erable, if Chri&s;t and the King &s;hould be &s;hut out &s;o. Rea&s;ons taken from the nature of a common-wealth, not founded upon Chri&s;t, nor by his Maje&s;tyes charters, mu&s;t needs fall to
<PB N="73" REF="011300_0039_0F89728D79D22790">
the ground, and faile tho&s;e that relye upon them. In the application of the de&s;cription, and the conclu&s;ions inferred, all things are not currant, all things doe not agree con|cerning the cau&s;es of common-wealths as is affirmed. There are 7 &s;everal opinions of this matter, which writers &s;peak of, though this be not &s;o material. Members of a common-wealth may not &s;eeke out all meanes that may conduce to the wellfare of the body, but all lawful and due meanes, according to the charter they hold by, either from God or the King, or from both: Nor may they keepe out what|&s;oever doth appeare to tend to theire damage (for many things appeare which are not) but &s;uch, as upon right and evident grounds, doe &s;o appeare, and are &s;o in truth. Thus farre concerning that which hath beene touched may for the pre&s;ent &s;uffice.</P>
<P>The &s;econd thinge is the rea&s;ons, which we &s;hall &s;ett downe and an&s;wer.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t rea&s;on of the equity of the order is this, <Q>If we be a corporation e&s;tabli&s;hed by free con&s;ent, if the place of our habitation be our owne, then no man hath right to come unto us without our con&s;ent.</Q></P>
<P>An&s;. We do not know how we that &s;tand a corporation, by vertue of the Kings charter, can thus argue; yet to avoyd di&s;pute, &s;uppo&s;e the antecedent &s;hould be granted, the con|&s;equence doth not follow. This is all that can be inferred, that our con&s;ent regulated by the worde, and &s;utable to our patent ought to be required, not this va&s;t and illimitted con&s;ent here &s;poken off, our con&s;ent is not our owne, when rightly limitted, 1 Cor. 6.19, 20. An unlawful di&s;&s;ent can hinder no man, though a lawful may.</P>
<P>The 2d rea&s;on runs thus,
<Q>If no man hath right to our lands, our government privilegdes, &amp;c. but by our con&s;ent, then it is rea&s;on we &s;hould take notice of men before we conferre any &s;uch upon them</Q></P>
<P>An&s;w. Be&s;ydes the doubtfulne&s;s of the truth of the &s;uppo&s;ition, the que&s;tion here is changed; for &s;o mo&s;t &s;tates doe in takeing the names of &s;uch as come to dwell among them, but the que&s;tion is whether the admitting or
<PB N="74" REF="011300_0040_0F89728E340590E0">
rejecting of per&s;ons &s;hould depend upon &s;uch unlimitted and un&s;afe a rule, as the will and de&s;cretion of men, &s;up|po&s;e magi&s;trates or others not regulated.</P>
<P>The 3d rea&s;on is thus framed, <Q>If we are bound to keepe off what&s;oever appeares to tende to our ruine and damage, then may we lawfully refu&s;e to receive &s;uch who&s;e di&s;po&s;itions &s;uite not with ours, and who&s;e &s;ocietye we know will be hurtefull unto us, and therefor it is lawful to take knowledge of men before we doe receive them.</Q></P>
<P>An&s;w. This kinde of rea&s;oning is very confu&s;ed and fallacious, for the que&s;tion here is not only changed, but there is this further deceite of wrapping up many que&s;tions in one, and be&s;ides if it were put into a right forme, the a&s;&s;umption would be fal&s;e.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion is not, as was &s;aid before, whether know|ledge may not be taken of men, before they be received, nor whether magi&s;trates may refu&s;e &s;uch as &s;uite not with their di&s;po&s;itions, or &s;uch who&s;e &s;ocietye they know will be hurteful to them; though the &s;econd of the&s;e is not, nor cannot be proved; but whether per&s;ons may be rejected, or admitted, upon the illimitted con&s;ent or di&s;&s;ent of ma|gi&s;trates. The a&s;&s;umption al&s;o would be fal&s;e, for men are not to keepe off what&s;oever appeares to tend to their ruine, but what really doth &s;o; Eliah appeared to Ahab, and, no doubt, to his coun&s;ell of &s;tate, a troubler of the common-wealth, one that brought 3 yeares famine, enough to ruine the whole &s;tate: Yet the Jewi&s;h magi&s;trates ought not to have rejected him and all tho&s;e of his frame and judgment, becau&s;e thus it appeared; for in truth Elijah was the hor&s;emen of I&s;rael and the chariots thereof. It appeared al&s;o to the chiefe prie&s;ts and phari&s;ees, that if our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour were let alone, it would tend to their ruine, John 11.47, 48. and therefore u&s;ed meanes to keep it off by rejecting Chri&s;t and his go&s;pel, and yet we hope you will not &s;ay they were bound to doe &s;o. La&s;tly, it appeares to the Natives heere (who by your definition are compleat common-wealths among them&s;elves) that the
<PB N="75" REF="011300_0040_0F89728E340590E0">
cohabitation of the Engli&s;h with them tends to their utter ruine, yet we beleeve you will not &s;ay they may lawfully keepe us out upon that grounde, for our cohabitation with them may tend to theire conver&s;ion and &s;o to theire eternal &s;alvation, and then they &s;hould doe mo&s;t de&s;pe|rately and &s;innefully. Let us then doe unto our brethren at lea&s;t as we would de&s;yre to be done unto by Barbari|ans, which is not to be rejected, becau&s;e we &s;uite not with the di&s;po&s;ition of theire Sechem, nor becau&s;e, by our com|ing, God takes them away and troubles them, and &s;o, to theire appearance, we ruine them.</P>
<P>The 4th argument &s;tands thus, <Q>The churches take libertye (as lawfully they may) to receive or rejecte at their di&s;cretion; yea particular townes make orders to &s;uch effect, why then &s;hould the commonwealth be denied the like libertye, and the whole more re&s;trained than any part?</Q></P>
<P>An&s;w. Though the que&s;tion be here concluded, yet it is farre from being &s;oundly proved, yea, in trueth, we much wonder that any member of a church &s;hould be ignorant of the fal&s;ene&s;s of the ground worke upon which this conclu&s;ion is built; for &s;hould churches have this power, as you &s;ay they have, to receive or rejecte at their di&s;cretion, they would quickely grow corrupt enough. Churches have no libertye to receive or rejecte, at their di&s;cretions, but at the di&s;cretion of Chri&s;t, what&s;oever is done in word or deed, in church or common-wealth, mu&s;t be done in the name of the Lord Je&s;us. (Coll. 3.17.) Neither hath church nor common-wealth any other than mini&s;teriall power from Chri&s;t (Eph. 5.23.) who is the head of the church, and the prince of the kings of the earth. (Rev. 1.5.) After that Cornelius and his companye had received the holy gho&s;t, whereby the right which they had to the covenant was evidenced, it is not now left to the di&s;cretion of the church whether they would admitte them there|unto or not. But can any man forbid them water faith Peter, he commanded them to be baptized. (Acts 10.47, 48.) There is the like rea&s;on of admi&s;&s;ion into churches,
<PB N="76" REF="011300_0041_0F89728EF40513E0">
when Chri&s;t opens a door to any theres none may take libertye to &s;hut them out. In one word, there is no liber|tye to be taken neither in church nor commonwealth but that which Chri&s;t gives and is according unto him, Gal. 5.1.</P>
<P>The 5th rea&s;on produced is, <Q>If it be &s;inne in us, to denye &s;ome men place among&s;t us, then it is becau&s;e they have &s;ome right to our place.</Q></P>
<P>An&s;w. The que&s;tion is heere againe changed, for it is not whether &s;ome may be denyed, but whether any or all &s;uch as the magi&s;trates illimitted di&s;&s;ent &s;hall rejecte. But be&s;ydes this, we &s;ay, that the kings chri&s;tian &s;ubjects have right by his maje&s;ties pattent, to come over and plante in places not inhabited, for a double end, 1&s;t, to enlarge his maje&s;ties dominions, 2dly, for the conver&s;ion of the Pagans. And &s;ince his maje&s;tie hath given them right for the&s;e ends, we may not denye them, unle&s;s they forfeite it, either by denyeing the land which they inhabite to be an enlarge|ment of his maje&s;ties dominions, or becoming &s;uch di&s;&s;olute and prophane per&s;ons as rather doe harden the Indians than be a meanes of their conver&s;ion, for by &s;o doing we &s;hall exceed the limitts of his maje&s;ties grante, and forfeite the priviledges, government and lands which we challenge to be our owne.</P>
<P>Moreover, we may not denye re&s;idence, to any of his maje&s;ties &s;ubjects without ju&s;t grounds, except we will doe injury both to the king and his &s;ubjects, who have adven|tured both theire e&s;tates and lives to enjoye tho&s;e privi|ledges and libertyes, which he hath granted them. Be|&s;ydes the law doth not only prohibite tho&s;e whom the ma|gi&s;trates &s;hall di&s;like to plante in tho&s;e places uninhabited, though in an orderly manner, but to make their abode in friends hou&s;es, either given or &s;old, or hyred, which are lawful meanes of obtaineing right. Now if the kings maje&s;tie give me right, if title be procured by donation, purcha&s;e, farmeing, &amp;c. If now this &s;tate at theire plea|&s;ure, take this away and expell men from the &s;ame, what were this but to exerci&s;e robbery, and to vex the poore
<PB N="77" REF="011300_0041_0F89728EF40513E0">
and the needy, and oppre&s;&s;e the &s;tranger wrongfully, a &s;inne forerunning de&s;olation, (Ezek. 22.29.) and &s;uch an one as will more ruine the &s;tate by the execution thereof, than tho&s;e per&s;ons (whom the law intend to expell) were the law aboli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The 6th rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned is this,
<Q>If &s;trangers have right to our hou&s;es or lands, &amp;c. then it is either of ju&s;tice or mercye,</Q>
&amp;c.</P>
<P>An&s;w. The que&s;tion &s;till is changed, but in an&s;wer to this we &s;ay, &s;uch may the &s;tranger be as have true right of cohabitation, and &s;ojourning with us, as hath beene &s;hewed, and that of ju&s;tice, by his maje&s;ties pattent, for they are fellow &s;ubjects to one and the &s;ame prince, they are al&s;o of the &s;ame nation, and if they be chri&s;tians they are in a farre nearer relation than all the&s;e, even fellow brethren, and coheires of all the ble&s;&s;ings layd up for them in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and in all the&s;e con&s;iderations have right of cohabitation and re&s;idence with us.</P>
<P>The 7th rea&s;on is this, <Q>A familye is a little common-wealth and a common-wealth is a great familye, now a familye is not bound to entertaine all comers, no not every good man, otherwi&s;e than by way of ho&s;pitalitye, no more is a common-wealth.</Q></P>
<P>An&s;w. Here againe the que&s;tion is much changed, it &s;hould not have been proved that we are not bound to receive all comers nor all good men, but rather no comers at all, unle&s;&s;e it be upon the unlimitted con&s;ent of the magi&s;trates. Although it be true, that there is &s;ome proportion betweene a familye and a common-wealth, yet there is a great di&s;paritye in this matter. A mai&s;ter of a familye hath another kinde of right to his hou&s;e and e&s;tate than this common-wealth hath to all the hou&s;es and lands within this patent. The mai&s;ter of a familye may bequeath his whole e&s;tate to his wife and children, and &s;o may not the body of this common-wealth to theires. The king will looke for &s;ome right, nor may we blame him, if he doe. Many are no members of the common-wealth, and yet have good right both to hou&s;es and lands here, many members of this &s;tate agree not to this law, but have
<PB N="78" REF="011300_0042_0F89728FB40BB718">
prote&s;ted again&s;t it as &s;innfull and unwhole&s;ome, and yet we hope the re&s;t have not as good right to their hou&s;es goods and lands as the mai&s;ter of the familye hath to his. If the &s;tate &s;hould take upon them &s;uch a right, I pray you con&s;ider whether it would not prove a greater wronge, even like to that of Labans toward Jacob, who told him that all were his, Gen. 31.43. It is to be feared &s;uch pleas of right will worke more trouble to this &s;tate, if they be noy&s;ed abroad, than the entertainment of tho&s;e people again&s;t whom this law is made.</P>
<P>Eighthly it is thus rea&s;oned, <Q>It is a generall rule, <HI>turpius ejicitur quam non admittitur ho&s;pes,</HI> it is wor&s;e to receive a man whom we mu&s;t ca&s;t out, than to deny him admittance.</Q></P>
<P>An&s;w. Let any man re&s;olve the&s;e words, and they will be farre from proveing the equitye, though they may per|haps the intent of the courts order. The thinge which from hence is concluded will only amount to this. That it is wor&s;e for a common-wealth to receive a man whom they mu&s;t ca&s;t out againe, than to deny him admittance. The rea&s;on is taken from humane authoritye, but what is this to the pointe in controver&s;ye, why &s;hould men thus argue, and their conclu&s;ions &s;o farre from the marke, yet as we &s;aid perhaps this may &s;hew the courts intent, for this intimation we have from hence, That the intent of the common-wealth is to ca&s;t out all &s;uch as have beene received in tymes pa&s;t, who are of the &s;ame judgment with them, whom the magi&s;trates will not admitt but ca&s;t out, though with a greate deale more di&s;hone&s;tye, for <HI>turpius ejicitur,</HI> &amp;c. which if it mu&s;t be, the Lords will be done.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Vane's adherents were afterwards bani&s;hed. See <HI>Ma&s;&s;. Hi&s;t. Vol. p.</HI> 75.</NOTE></P>
<P>Ninthly, it is thus further argued, <Q>The rule of the Apo&s;tle, John 2.10. is, that &s;uch as come and bring not the true doctrine with them &s;hould not be received to hou&s;e, and by the &s;ame rea&s;on not into the com.wealth.</Q></P>
<P>The que&s;tion is &s;till wonderfully changed, for if the order now in que&s;tion were but conformable to this rule of the Apo&s;tle none would oppo&s;e it, but the order is
<PB N="79" REF="011300_0042_0F89728FB40BB718">
therefore &s;crupelled, becau&s;e it &s;etts downe no rule for the magi&s;trates to walke by in that admittance or rejection of &s;uch as come, but leaves it to their illimitted con&s;ent or di&s;&s;ent, nay &s;uch were the expre&s;&s;ions of the &s;ame, in the court, who had a hand in this law, as cleares it to us that this law oppo&s;eth directly this rule; for &s;uch as doe bring the doctrine intended in the text, are the per&s;ons which are aymed at to be denyed re&s;idence, as &s;ad experience al&s;o in the execution hath given us in parte to &s;ee already, and wee feare in the future will yet doe more.</P>
<P>The 10th and la&s;t rea&s;on is this in effect, <Q>Such may not come into the land as by the con&s;ent of all are to be re|jected, and therefore it is lawful to take notice of them.</Q></P>
<P>We much marvaile that it &s;hould be &s;o often &s;aid, the law is only for takeing notice, is it not plaine that &s;uch are to be fined who receive them whom the magi&s;trates allow not? and cannot notice be taken of men without &s;uch a cour&s;e as this? Why &s;hould any in higher place &s;peake in open court&mdash;Let us have their money fir&s;t?&mdash; What meanes the words immediately following which &s;peake of rejecting and keeping out by vertue of this order, if it were only made to take notice of &s;uch? It would have done very well to have kept to the que&s;tion, and not argue &s;o farre di&s;tant from the purpo&s;e as this doth. What if &s;ome come into the land and are to be rejected, are any therefor to be rejected in an undue and &s;innful way? In the enlargement of this rea&s;on the law is excu&s;ed, if it be not rightly executed, and they which are to execute it are likewi&s;e defended, if they follow their judgments and con|&s;ciences. The law is excu&s;ed becau&s;e it hath a good intent, but good intents do not make a law or action good, what was intended the execution doth declare. Now is it &s;uffi|cient for tho&s;e who are betru&s;ted with the execution of this law to follow their per&s;wa&s;ions, judgments, and con&s;ciences, except they be rightly ruled by the word of trueth? Paul was per&s;waded that he &s;hould doe tho&s;e things which he did again&s;t Je&s;us of Nazareth, Acts 26.9. They which kill Gods children may thinke they doe God good &s;ervice,

John 16.1. but in &s;o doeing, neither the one nor the other are to be excu&s;ed. It is not a full per&s;wa&s;ion that makes a thinge lawfull from the rule Rom. 14.5. but a full per|&s;wa&s;ion upon good grounds. All the actions of chri&s;tians mu&s;t be according to the rule Chri&s;t gives them to walke by, Gal. 6.6.</P>
<P>Object. 1. Some prophane per&s;ons are received, and others who are religious are rejected. To which you an|&s;wer there is no &s;uch thing knowne to be done, and if it were it might be ju&s;tified, becau&s;e prophane per&s;ons may be le&s;&s;e dangerous, than &s;uch as are religious, of large parts, confirmed in &s;ome erroneous way, our Saviour conver&s;ed with publicans, &amp;c. and &s;ayd they were nearer the king|dom of heaven than religious phari&s;ees. This is the &s;umme. As for the objection which is made, it is your owne; for any thing we know, we would not object in this manner. It is not the refu&s;ing of &s;ome religious per&s;ons again&s;t which we except, but again&s;t the libertye which is given by this law of rejecting tho&s;e, that are truly and parti|cularly religious, if the magi&s;trates doe not like them, which is already put in practice, as farre as may be judged. If you deny any thing to be done, there are divers wit|ne&s;&s;es will affirme the contrarye. If you &s;ay it be more dangerous to accept &s;uch than prophane per&s;ons you need not much confutation, &s;uch &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ings where&s;oever they come, Gen. 12.2. they will not need to be bound to the peace or good behaviour as &s;ome that are admitted by authoritye by their bla&s;phemous and quarrelling &s;peeches. As for &s;cribes and phari&s;ees wee will not pleade for them, let them doe it who walke in their way; nor for &s;uch as are confirmed in any way of errour, though all &s;uch are not to be denyed cohabitation, but are to be pitied and reformed, Jude 22, 23. I&s;hmael &s;hall dwell in the pre&s;ence of his brethren, Gen. 16.12.</P>
<P>Object. 2. It is objected that by this law we reject good chri&s;tians and &s;o con&s;equently Chri&s;t him&s;elfe, and it is made of purpo&s;e to keepe away &s;uch as are of Mr. Wheel|wrights judgment. To the former parte of this objection
<PB N="81" REF="011300_0043_0F8972907214F028">
you &s;ay, it is not knowne that any chri&s;tian man hath been rejected, and that chri&s;tians in &s;ome ca&s;es may be rejected, holding &s;ome pernicious errors. This is the &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>To which we an&s;wer that diver&s;e chri&s;tians have been already rejected &s;o farre, as they are not allowed to make any abode among&s;t us, but for a &s;hort limitted tyme, and by the law they may be rejected for ever. All the tyme &s;uch are rejected Chri&s;t is rejected, Luke 10.16. Acts 9.4. Suppo&s;e &s;ome chri&s;tians may be refu&s;ed and Chri&s;t not re|fu&s;ed (which is not yet proved) that is nothing to the law nor to the pre&s;ent execution of it. If you deale with &s;uch make it appear. To the latter parte of this objection you an&s;wer, that you cannot confe&s;&s;e that it is made again&s;t them of Mr. Wheelwights judgment, and if it were, where is the evil of it, &s;eeing that the opinions are &s;uch as he pro|fe&s;&s;eth cannot &s;tand with external peace, and will cau&s;e divi&s;ions, and will make the people looke at their magi|&s;trates, mini&s;ters and brethren, as enemyes to Chri&s;t and antichri&s;tian, more dangerous than the opinion of Mr. Williams? We omitt divers words for brevityes &s;ake and change not the matter. To this we replye, that though you cannot confe&s;&s;e it, yet it doth appeare by your examina|tions of them you refu&s;e, for pre&s;ent demanding of them whether they know him, and wi&s;hing of them to di&s;claime his doctrine, and excepting again&s;t them becau&s;e they are allyed to them of the &s;ame judgment, as likewi&s;e by the courts proceeding again&s;t him, that there is &s;ome &s;uch thing; though indeed we would not make this objection, though &s;ome of the like kinde.</P>
<P>Now whereas you grante this by way of conce&s;&s;ion, and give rea&s;ons to ju&s;tifie the &s;ame, they are either weak or greate mi&s;takes.

and all Jeru&s;alem is troubled, Matth. 2.3. Paul and Silas were accu&s;ed for turneing the world up&s;yde downe, Acts 17.5. We que&s;tion not but he will grante that the Lord can and doth &s;ometymes give his church re&s;t, Acts 9.31. but this will not &s;tand nor continue, which we know to be his meaneinge. A man cannot be Chri&s;t's di&s;ciple but he mu&s;t meete with cro&s;&s;es, Matth. 16.24. E&s;au and Jacob wre&s;tled together in their mothers wombe, Gen. 25.22. In the 2d place you except again&s;t his opinions, becau&s;e they make devi&s;ions. The go&s;pell which he or any man holds forth will cau&s;e devi&s;ions by accident, Matth. 10.34.35. If he be blamed for this, Chri&s;t cannot be excu&s;ed. The 3d thing you alledge is that his opinions make people looke at their magi&s;trates, mini&s;ters and brethren as antichri&s;tians, enemies to Chri&s;t, but we know no &s;uch doctrine which he taught, all which he delivered concerning this matter, was a de&s;cription of the way of workes and antichri&s;tiani&s;me, and &s;o farre as magi&s;trates and mini&s;ters walke in that way they are to be looked at as antichri&s;tian, John 4.1, 2, 3. La&s;tly, it is &s;aid that his opinions are more dangerous than tho&s;e of Mr. Williams which, if it be true, then is the doctrine of the go&s;pell more dangerous than that for which Mr. Wil|liams was bani&s;hed; for as yet we know nothing which Mr. Wheelwright helde di&s;&s;onant from the go&s;pell, nei|ther hath he beene confuted, though condemned, and it is not our judgments &s;o much as the cau&s;e which is changed.</P>
<P>The&s;e objections and an&s;wers being viewed, and what is un&s;ound refuted, we come to the conclu&s;ion, wherein we are de&s;yered to judge what evill we finde in the law, and this we will doe faithfully by the helpe of Chri&s;t. This law we judge to be mo&s;t wicked and &s;innefull, and that for the&s;e rea&s;ons.</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e this law doth leave the&s;e weightye matters of the common-wealth, of receiving or rejecting &s;uch as come over to the approbation of magi&s;trates, and &s;u&s;pends the&s;e things upon the judgment of man, whereas the judg|ment is Gods, Deut. 1.17. This is made a ground worke of gro&s;&s;e popery. Prie&s;ts and magi&s;trates are to judge, but
<PB N="83" REF="011300_0044_0F897291F9E968B0">
it mu&s;t be according to the law of God, Deut. 17.9, 10, 11. That law which gives that without limittation to man, which is proper to God, cannot be ju&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. Becau&s;e here is libertye given by this law to expell and reject tho&s;e which are mo&s;t eminent chri&s;tians, if they &s;uite not with the di&s;po&s;ition of the magi&s;trates, whereby it will come to pa&s;&s;e, that Chri&s;t and his members will finde wor&s;e entertainment among&s;t us than the I&s;raelites did among&s;t the Egyptians and Babilonians, than Abram and I&s;aack did among&s;t the Phili&s;tines, than Jacob among&s;t the Shechemites, yea even than Lott among&s;t the Sodo|mites. The&s;e all gave leave to Gods people, to &s;it downe among&s;t them, though they could not clayme &s;uch right as the Kings &s;ubjects may. Now that law, the execution whereof may make us more cruell and tyrannicall over Gods children than Pagans, yea than Sodomites, mu&s;t needs be mo&s;t wicked and &s;innefull.</P>
<P N="3">3. This law doth cro&s;&s;e many lawes of Chri&s;t, Chri&s;t would have us render unto Cae&s;ar the things that are Cae|&s;ars, Math. 22.21. But this law will not give unto the Kings maje&s;ty his right of planting &s;ome of his &s;ubjects among&s;t us, except they plea&s;e them, Chri&s;t bids us not to forget to entertaine &s;trangers, Heb. 13.2. But here by this law we mu&s;t not entertaine, for any continuance of time, &s;uch &s;tranger as the magi&s;trates like not, though they be never &s;o gracious, allowed of both by God and good men, except we will forfeite unto them our whole e&s;tates, it may be and much more than our e&s;tates comes unto. Chri&s;t commands us to do good unto all, but e&s;pecially to them of the hou&s;ehold of faith. Many other lawes there are of Chri&s;t, which this law da&s;heth again&s;t, and therefore is mo&s;t wicked and &s;innefull.</P>

<HEAD>A Reply to an An&s;wer made to a Declaration of the Intent and Equity of the Order made at the Court in May la&s;t, whereby none are to be re|ceived &amp;c. but by allowance of the Magi&s;trates.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Court was held at Newtown, now Cambridge, in May 1637.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>COntentions among brethren are &s;ad &s;pectacles, among the churches of Chri&s;t, e&s;pecially when they come once to &s;avour of bitterne&s;&s;e, which would have di&s;cou|raged me from publi&s;hing the former declaration, if I could have expected &s;uch an an&s;wer: And in that re&s;pect I &s;hould willingly have &s;itten downe under my reproach, if the cau&s;e of truth and ju&s;tice had not called me againe to this ta&s;ke; wherein, if I deale more &s;harply, than myne owne di&s;po&s;ition leads me, the blame mu&s;t fall upon him, who puts &s;uch occa&s;ions upon me, as I cannot otherwi&s;e &s;hunne.</P>
<P>Many faults doth the An&s;werer find in my declara|tion. which I mu&s;t examine as thay come in order. The <Q>1&s;t is, that in de&s;cribing a common wealth (&s;uch as ours is) I do not de&s;cribe it, as it is chri&s;tian, nor as it is founded upon the grant of our King.</Q></P>
<P>To this I replye 1&s;t, the defininition or de&s;cription of the genus may be applyed to all the &s;pecies, re&s;erving the &s;pecificall differences: To define a man to be a rea&s;onable creature is a true definition of any man, whether rich or poor, chri&s;tian or heathen: and when I de&s;cribe a com|mon wealth in general or in a more civil or politicke re&s;|pecte, the churches or chri&s;tians which are in it, fall not into con&s;ideration, as to the being of it, for it may be a true body politicke, though there be neither church nor chri&s;|tian in it.</P>
<P>The like may be &s;ayd for the forme of government, whether it be by patent or otherwi&s;e yet it is a govern|ment, and &s;o the de&s;cription is &s;afe and true.</P>
<P N="2">2d. The de&s;cription which I make doth include all that which he doth complaine to be wanting. The words
<PB N="85" REF="011300_0045_0F89729304165748">
are the&s;e. A company of people, con&s;enting to cohabite under one government, for their mutual &s;afety and well|fare. Now let ours be layd to this de&s;cription and the truth will appeare. We A.B.C. &amp;c. con&s;ented to cohabite in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and under the government &s;et up among us by his Maje&s;ty's patent or grant for our mutual &s;afety and wellfare, we agreed to walke according to the rules of the go&s;pell. And thus you have both a chri&s;tian common weale and the &s;ame founded upon the patent, and both in|cluded within my de&s;cription.</P>
<P>I will adde only what I conceive from this and other like pa&s;&s;ages in his an&s;wer, viz. that he makes this exception rather to &s;helter him&s;elf under pretence of his renderne&s;s of the kings honour and right, than out of any ignorance of the true latitude of my de&s;cription; and withall he di&s;|covers how little he regardeth what jealou&s;yes he put us under, &s;o he may &s;helter his owne parties. The Lord give him to &s;ee his &s;ecret underminings, that it may be forgiven him. Having thus faulted my de&s;cription, he taketh upon him to teach me a better; and for this he refers me, by a marginal quotation to Proverb 8.5. the text is this, Oh ye &s;imple under&s;tand wi&s;dome and ye fools be ye of an un|der&s;tanding heart; and to I&s;ai. 6.7. And he layd it upon my mouth and &s;ayd loe this hath touched thy lipps &amp;c. How the&s;e places will prove his de&s;cription of a chri&s;tian common wealth, founded upon the kings patent is beyond my reach, but it &s;uits well with a practi&s;e now in u&s;e, to &s;peak nothing but what they bring &s;cripture for; &s;o &s;crip|ture be alledged it matters not how impertinent they be.</P>
<P>As for your de&s;cription it &s;elf, I have no more to &s;ay again&s;t it, but that it was not requi&s;ite, to that which I projected, to expre&s;&s;e tho&s;e particulars; and our lawyers will tell you that <HI>expre&s;&s;io eorum quae tacit&egrave; in&s;unt nihil operatur:</HI> My intent was to prove the proprietye and privi|ledges of a common weale which may al&s;o belong to &s;uch government among Turkes and Pagans, &s;o far as they may fall within my de&s;cription without any prejudice to the mo&s;t chri&s;tian government, that is, as if I &s;peake of one
<PB N="86" REF="011300_0046_0F897293749326F8">
that is an hone&s;t man, and &s;ay that he goeth upright, &s;peakes, laughs, &amp;c. when a Turke or a Pagan doth the &s;ame.</P>
<P>His next exception is, that I &s;ay <Q>that &s;uch a body politic may u&s;e all meanes, which may conduce to their wellfare, and do not re&s;train it to lawful meanes.</Q></P>
<P>To this I reply, that it is according to &s;cripture phra&s;e, and our common &s;peach. When we call upon a &s;icke man, to u&s;e meanes for his recoverye, we are well enough under|&s;tood, though we put not the word lawful: I may do all things, &s;aith Paul, and give all diligence &s;aith Peter, with|out expre&s;&s;ing lawful, which the An&s;werer would have un|der&s;tood well enough, if he had not beene minded to &s;eeke a knot in a ru&s;h; only I &s;ee not why he &s;hould pa&s;&s;e over tho&s;e many things which he &s;aith are que&s;tionable in my ground worke, and take up tho&s;e which will afford &s;o little advantage.</P>
<P>Then he proceeds to examine the rea&s;ons which I layd downe to prove the equitie of this law.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t rea&s;on is this, "If we be a corporation e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by free con&s;ent, if the place of our habitation be our owne&mdash;then no man hath right to come in to us, without our con&s;ent."</P>
<P>To this he an&s;wers, that "he knoweth not how we who &s;tand a corporation by the Kings patent can thus argue." To this I replye then. I will tell him, that which the King is plea&s;ed to be&s;tow upon us, and we have accepted, is truly our owne.</P>
<P N="2">2. He denyeth the con&s;equence by a di&s;tinction of a con&s;ent regulated, and a va&s;t and illimited con&s;ent.</P>
<P>Replye: To &s;peake of con&s;ent in general, implyeth alwayes a con&s;ent &s;uitable to the power or intere&s;t of him who is to give it; as when we &s;ay, a child may not marrye without con&s;ent of parents, we know it is regulated, yet when a father pleads it, he doth not neede to expre&s;&s;e all the limitations.</P>
<P>Thus he runs on in a frivolous di&s;cour&s;e, and in the end falls upon this fal&s;e conclu&s;ion, "An unlawful di&s;&s;ent can hinder no man," So that if he had need to borrow my
<PB N="87" REF="011300_0046_0F897293749326F8">
hor&s;e, and I ought by the rule of love to lend him to him, though I refu&s;e to con&s;ent to his reque&s;t herein, yet he may take him, becau&s;e my di&s;&s;ent is unlawfull; &s;o by this conclu&s;ion a wife, a childe, a &s;ervant may doe any thinge that is lawfull, though the hu&s;band, father, or mai&s;ter deny their con&s;ent. If this &s;peed well, the next conclu&s;ion will be an anarchie.</P>
<P>After this di&s;cour&s;e I expected &s;omewhat to have taken away the con&s;equence of my argument, but I finde not a word to that purpo&s;e, he is &s;uddainly fallen upon my &s;econd rea&s;on, which is this,</P>
<P>"If no man hath right to our land, &amp;c. but by our con|&s;ent, then it is rea&s;on we &s;hould take nottice of men, be|fore we conferre any &s;uch upon them."</P>
<P>This he partly grants, but complaines of the change of the que&s;tion, to which I replye that I did not propound any rea&s;ons in a &s;yllogi&s;ticall frame, but by way of di&s;|cour&s;e, and that which this argument tends unto was only to &s;hew why &s;ome were not pre&s;ently allowed, but a time taken, wherein we might gayne &s;ome nottice and tryall of them, and there was no need why the an&s;werer &s;hould &s;o often complaine of the change of the que&s;tion; for if he takes my rea&s;ons together he cannot denye but the que&s;tion it&s;elfe is argued and concluded, as will appeare by the &s;equell, I will therefore pa&s;&s;e by all that he &s;trives about, upon this &s;uppo&s;ed fallacie, and joyne with him in the que&s;tion, as he &s;tates it, viz.</P>
<P>Whether the admitting or rejecting of per&s;ons &s;hould depend upon the di&s;cretions of men, which he calls an unlimitted and un&s;afe rule and their di&s;cretion not regu|lated, though they &s;hould be magi&s;trates.</P>
<P>To this I replye, or rather an&s;were, fir&s;t, That which he takes for granted, and wherein lyes the whole &s;trength of his defence is untrue, viz. That the magi&s;trates will and di&s;cretion in our ca&s;e is not regulated, for 1&s;t, the magi|&s;trates are members of the churches here and, by that covenant, are regulated to direct all their wayes by the rule of the go&s;pell, and if they faile in any thinge, they are &s;ubject to the churches correction. 2dly. As they are
<PB N="88" REF="011300_0047_0F89729432B6F0D0">
freemen, they are regulated by oath, to direct their aymes to the wellfare of this civill body. 3dly. As they are ma|gi&s;trates, they are &s;worne to doe right to all, and regulated by their relation to the people, to &s;eeke theire wellfare in all things; &s;o as here is no &s;uch irregulated di&s;cretion as is &s;uppo&s;ed, and it &s;eems to me an improper &s;peech and &s;avouring of contradiction; for di&s;cretion alwayes im|plyes a rule for its guide. And herein I have occa&s;ion to take in his an&s;were to my 4th rea&s;on drawne from the practice of our churches, and &s;ome towns where matters of admitting or rejecting are ordered by di&s;cretion. And here it is made a wonder that I &s;hew &s;o much ignorance. I mu&s;t confe&s;&s;e my ignorance is greate, and I cannot hide it, being expo&s;ed &s;o much as I am to publick view: Yet that will not cover the an&s;werers blindne&s;s, from prejudice in this greate wonder, which is &s;uch as he cannot di&s;cerne the voyce and will of Chri&s;t di&s;penced in the di&s;cretion of his &s;ervants and people, and yet tells us not how it &s;hould be knowne otherwi&s;e. Did he never heare. that our prac|ti&s;e is, that none are propounded to the congregation, ex|cept they be fir&s;t allowed by the elders,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This mu&s;t needs render the influence of the Clergy very great under the old Con&s;titution. No body could be propo&s;ed to the Church for a Member unle&s;s the Mini&s;ter allowed it. No body could be admitted a freeman unle&s;s he was a Member of the Church.</NOTE> and is not this to admitt or reject by di&s;cretion? Did he never heare of a chri&s;tian man rejected by the church, or put off at lea&s;t, be|cau&s;e a brother hath profe&s;&s;ed want of &s;atisfaction? Hath he never heard that the di&s;&s;ent of &s;ome few brethren may, by rule, (as hath beene &s;ayd) cau&s;e the rejection of a man, whom all the re&s;t of the brethren &s;hall approve of? And where is Chri&s;ts voyce to be heard now, if he will have di&s;cretion &s;hut out of the church. So &s;ays the in&s;tance of townes matters (which he wi&s;ely declines and gives no an|&s;wer to) he well knowes that within the towne of Bo&s;ton it is an e&s;tabli&s;hed order, that none &s;hould be received into cohabitation there, except they be allowed by certain men appointed to judge of their fitne&s;s for church-fellow&s;hip. And &s;o, whereas the way of God hath alwayes beene to gather his churches out of the world; now, the world, or
<PB N="89" REF="011300_0047_0F89729432B6F0D0">
civill &s;tate, mu&s;t be rai&s;ed out of the churches. And yet the an&s;werer can finde nothing of wonder of ignorance here. And if he had enquired of our neighbours at Ply|mouth, they could have tould him that their practice hath beene upon the like law, for many yeares, I mean in referring it to the di&s;cretion of the magi&s;trates to receive and reject &s;uch as come to them. And if he had con|&s;idered of a rule in the law of Mo&s;es, he &s;hould finde that there is power given to a hu&s;band or father to allow or make void any vow of a wife or childe at their di&s;cretion, yet I hope he will not call this a va&s;t and unlimitted rule.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e the word di&s;cretion &s;eems &s;o offen&s;ive and un&s;afe, let us trye it by the ballance of the &s;anctuarye, if we can finde it to hold weight there, &s;ure it will prove a good mea&s;ure for civill affaires.</P>
<P>The word in &s;cripture is &s;ometymes taken for &s;ound rea&s;on, as P&s;al. 112.5. He will order his affaires by di&s;cre|tion; &s;o Pro. 11.12. Sometymes for under&s;tanding, as Pro. 19.11. I&s;ai. 28.26. Sometymes for &s;kill, as Pro- 2.11. Pro. 3.21. Sometymes for judgment, Phill. 1.9. And in all places in a good &s;ence, for it is a gift of God wherein he de&s;pen&s;eth his own wi&s;dome in all the affairs of men, both in church and common wealth; all lawes are made by di&s;cretion, and the equitie of them is found out and applyed to particular ca&s;es by di&s;cretion; by it (being guided by the &s;pirit of God) the mynde and will of God is found out in his word, Acts 5.8 and Acts 8.23. Acts 15.38. Acts 21.23. Levit. 27.8, 12. So for judgment in civil cau&s;es; by di&s;cretion did Solomon judge betweene the harlots. It is not po&s;&s;ible to provide a law that in the letter of it &s;hall reach every ca&s;e which may fall out, as we &s;ee by the law of God it &s;elfe in the &s;ame place of Levit. 27.8. then it mu&s;t re&s;t in the di&s;cretion of the judge to di&s;cerne, &s;o doth the Lord him&s;elfe appointe, Deut. 17.8.9. &amp;c. they are to do as the judge &s;hall deter|mine, and that which he &s;hall declare for law, that mu&s;t they obey, otherwi&s;e there could be no determination in hard and doubtful ca&s;es. As for the&s;e &s;criptures which the An&s;werer alledgeth about Chri&s;t his &s;ouerainty, &amp;c.
<PB N="90" REF="011300_0048_0F897294F4B5FCF0">
they are nothing to the que&s;tion; for the prerogative authority of Chri&s;t in all affaires in church and common wealth, doth not hinder the manner of his di&s;pen&s;ations of the mini&s;try of his &s;ervants, and in the improvement of &s;uch gifts of his, of wi&s;dome, di&s;cretion, &amp;c. as he is plea&s;ed to exerci&s;e his authority in, according to the rule of his word.</P>
<P>My 5th rea&s;on is, that it is no &s;inne or injury to deny a man that which he hath no right unto, therefore we may denye &s;ome men place among&s;t us. In the an&s;wer, there is againe complainte of changing the que&s;tion, becau&s;e I go about to prove that &s;ome men may be rejected, which he &s;eemeth to grant, and if &s;o then that which he maketh the maine que&s;tion will ea&s;ily be cleared, for if we may re|ject &s;ome, then the care of this mu&s;t be committed to &s;ome per&s;ons, for to &s;peak of di&s;cerning Chri&s;t his autho|rity in church or common wealth, otherwi&s;e than as it is di&s;pen&s;ed in the mini&s;try of men, is a meer idea or fan|ta&s;ye. If then it mu&s;t be committed to &s;ome per&s;ons, to whom may it more properly than to the fathers of the common wealth? And if it cannot be fore&s;eene who are to be received and who to be rejected, tho&s;e per&s;ons mu&s;t be tru&s;ted with the tryall of them, and if no certaine rule can be &s;et downe which may be &s;ufficient to di&s;cerne of every man, then mu&s;t it be committed to their di&s;cretion, regulated by the word of God, and the dutye of their place, which they are bound to ob&s;erve. And whereas the An&s;werer cryes out again&s;t this cour&s;e as va&s;t, illimitted, &s;inefull and injurious, and yet will not (and cannot) pre|&s;cribe us a better, neither in his an&s;wer, nor at the court when he oppo&s;ed the makeing of this law, may we not &s;afely judge that &s;uch oppo&s;ition and tho&s;e reproachful termes as are ca&s;t from it, upon an ordinance of God, in the faces of tho&s;e whom he would have to be had in honor for his &s;ake, proceed rather from di&s;temper of minde, than from any ju&s;t cau&s;e of offence?</P>
<P>Now here I might &s;trike him with his owne weappon, for when he &s;eekes to prove that any of the kings &s;ub|jects, have right by our patent to come and plant in places
<PB N="91" REF="011300_0048_0F897294F4B5FCF0">
not inhabited, he changes the que&s;tion indeed, for both the law and our di&s;pute have beene about entertaining into hou&s;es and townes, and not into places not inhabited. That que&s;tion may fall to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed upon &s;ome other occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Againe (that we may take notice how his zeale for the cau&s;e outrunes his judgment) he gives to all the kings chri&s;tian &s;ubjects a right to plant among us, by vertue of our patent, and &s;uch a right as by mi&s;u&s;age whereof they may forfeit the patent, and here he might fitly have brought in his va&s;t and illimitted termes, had he not mi&s;|placed them, for ha&s;t, for there was never &s;eene &s;uch a va&s;t patent of incorporation as &s;hould comprehend all the kings chri&s;tian &s;ubjects, which is as large as if he had &s;aid all his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>But that others may &s;ee his errour, if he him&s;elfe will not, let the patent be peru&s;ed, and there it will be found, that the incorporation is made to certaine per&s;ons by name, and unto &s;uch as they &s;hall a&s;&s;ociate to them&s;elves, and all this tract of land is granted to them and their a&s;&s;ociates: And after this he gives leave to any of his &s;ubjects to de|part out of his other dominions to this place: So then the ca&s;e &s;tandeth thus, the 10 men of Bo&s;ton allow a &s;trainger to &s;it downe among them, yet this gives him no right to any mans hou&s;e or land, nor to any lot in the towne, till it be granted him, nor to any privilege there till he be made free; we mu&s;t have a new &s;ort of rea&s;on to make this a good argument; the King gives a man leave to inhabite in the incorporate colony of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets, <HI>ergo,</HI> he hath hereby right to the lands there. His di&s;cour&s;e about the matter of general right by patent is &s;o confu&s;ed and irra|tional, as I &s;hould but wa&s;te tyme and paper to follow him in it, <HI>valeat ut valere pote&s;t.</HI> I finde nothing in it which may endainger my argument, except it be put out of countenance, by a fal&s;e clamour of robbery, vexation, op|pre&s;&s;ion, &amp;c. as if the &s;tate here went about to take from men their lawful right and expell them from their hou&s;es, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The 6th rea&s;on is this, if &s;traingers have right to our hou&s;es, &amp;c. then it is either of ju&s;tice or of mercye, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="011300_0049_0F897295B403DF48">The an&s;werer, after his wonted prejudice of change of the que&s;tion, undertakes to prove,
<Q>that &s;ome &s;traingers have right in ju&s;tice by the Kings patent,</Q>
only he re|&s;traineth it to cohabitation and &s;ojourning (which will con|clude nothing for him, &s;eeing this law doth not &s;hutt out all &s;traingers) The rea&s;ons he bringeth are three, the 1&s;t, becau&s;e they are fellow-&s;ubjects, 2dly, becau&s;e they are of the &s;ame nation, 3dly, becau&s;e they are chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>To this I replye, that I have alreadye cleared this pointe in laying open the extent and meaneing of the patent, and this I may &s;ay further, that I have reade over all the lawes of England and all the general cu&s;tomes and privi|leges of the Kings &s;ubjects there, but I have not found any thinge that may give the lea&s;t colour for &s;uch a privi|ledge as is pretended.</P>
<P>As for that of chri&s;tianitye I have granted in my de|claration that there is a right of ho&s;pitalitye, but for other right of cohabitation or &s;ojourning it mu&s;t be con&s;idered in &s;uch &s;pecial ca&s;es, as may fall out and cannot be pro|vided for by general rule.</P>
<P>My 7th rea&s;on is drawne from the proportion or re|&s;emblance that a common-wealth hath to a familye, which is not bound to entertaine all comers, no not every good man, otherwi&s;e than by way of ho&s;pitalitye.</P>
<P>The an&s;werer (his complainte of changing the que&s;tion premi&s;ed) &s;eekes to di&s;prove the proportion, by <Q>di&s;tin|gui&s;hing between the right which the mai&s;ter of a familye hath to his hou&s;e, &amp;c. and the right which this common wealth hath to all the hou&s;es, &amp;c. within this paient.</Q> This he amplyfyes by particular in&s;tances. <Q>1. in power of bequeathing them to his wife and children. 2. In re|gard of the King's right. 3. In re&s;pect of &s;uch as are no members, &amp;c. and yet have right to their hou&s;es, &amp;c. 4. In regard to &s;uch as have prote&s;ted again&s;t this law.</Q></P>
<P>To this I replye, that it is not needful they &s;hould hold proportion in all re&s;pect. It is &s;ufficient if they hold in that which is intended, viz. libertye to receive or reject; which being knowne to all and confe&s;&s;ed by the an&s;werer,
<PB N="93" REF="011300_0049_0F897295B403DF48">
in granting that &s;ome may be rejected, is &s;ufficient to make good the argument drawne from this &s;imilitude: yet to make it more cleare, I replye to the&s;e in&s;tances.</P>
<P>To the fir&s;t I &s;ay, that a bodye politicke may leave their hou&s;es, &amp;c. to their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, which are in the place of their children. 2. For the Kings right, that being para|mount, hinders no more in a common-wealth than it doth in a familye, for he hath the &s;ame intere&s;t in the hou&s;es, &amp;c. of the father of a familye. 3. For &s;uch as are no members they are as &s;ojourners in a familye, who though they have right to be in the familye them&s;elves, yet may not receive in any to re&s;ide in their particular chambers, without con|&s;ent of the ma&s;ter of the familye. 4. For &s;uch as prote&s;ted again&s;t this law, that prote&s;tation cometh too late (except they fir&s;t convince us of the inju&s;tice of the law) &s;eeing they formerly gave an implicite con&s;ent to all the whole|&s;ome lawes and orders of the body; neither need we feare to proclaime our right to our hou&s;es, &amp;c. again&s;t all in|truders, more than particular per&s;ons and corporations may do in England, notwith&s;tanding his Maje&s;ties intere&s;t in them al&s;o. Such objections are not worth any an&s;wer.</P>
<P>In his an&s;wer to my 8th rea&s;on, viz. <Q>Turpius eijcitur quam non admittititur ho&s;pes,</Q> he &s;aith it is of humaine authority, and that my conclu&s;ions are farr from the marke.</P>
<P>To this I replye, that though this &s;entence be humaine, yet the equitye of it is &s;trengthened by divine truths: It had been le&s;&s;e griefe to Abraham not to have received Hagar to his bed then it was after to ca&s;t her out; and it was <HI>turpius</HI> for Tobija and his &s;tuffe to be ca&s;t out of the temple, then it would if he had not been received in. Now that it may appear how farre my conclu&s;ion is from the marke, I will thus lay downe the argument. That law which &s;huts out &s;uch as being received in, &s;hall be worthy to be ca&s;t out is hone&s;t and of good reporte, but this law doth &s;o, <HI>ergo,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The major propo&s;ition is proved by the examples of Hagar and Tobija, the minor I prove thus; the law pro|vides to have &s;uch kept out as will di&s;turbe the peace here,
<PB N="94" REF="011300_0050_0F897296769937F8">
rightly e&s;tabli&s;hed by the rules of Gods word, <HI>ergo,</HI> &amp;c. except the argument may be avoyded, the conclu&s;ion will hitt the marke.</P>
<P>But the An&s;werer &s;aith that, <Q>1. Such ones as are in|tended to be kept out, are no di&s;turbers of our peace. 2. That the law doth not declare who are to be kept out and who not.</Q></P>
<P>To the&s;e I replye fir&s;t, for brevitys &s;ake let the apo|logie and the remon&s;trance, with the coppie of the whole &s;ermon (which him&s;elfe delivered into the court) be com|pared and examined, and they &s;hall decide the que&s;tion, if you will &s;tand to it.</P>
<P>To the &s;econd I replye, that your&s;elfe confe&s;&s;es who the law intended to keepe out; and though &s;uch a preamble as might have expre&s;&s;ed the full intent, was (for want of time) omitted (which was indeed a defect) yet &s;uch as were of the court, and did well know, can make no &s;uch advan|vantage of it, &s;eeing the magi&s;trates have other rules to guide them in the execution of it; and &s;o it is warranted by &s;cripture examples as that of our &s;aviour Math. 16.19. and 18.18. what&s;oever you binde on earth &s;hall be bound in heaven &amp;c. yet he doth not there tell them, who they ought to binde or loo&s;e.</P>
<P>The 9th argument is taken from that of the 2 John 10. Such as bring not the true doctrine are not to be received to hou&s;e, and con&s;equently not into the common wealth.</P>
<P>The An&s;werer (after his u&s;ual complainte of the change of the que&s;tion) acknowledgeth, that if the order had been made again&s;t &s;uch it would not have been oppo&s;ed; but affirmeth that it appears (by the &s;ame expre&s;&s;ions in the court, and by the execution of the law in part) that this law is made to keepe out &s;uch as bring the true doctrine of the go&s;pell, &s;o that now he hath brought the que&s;tion to this &s;tate, whether the opinions &s;pread in the country. and oppo&s;ed by the magi&s;trates and elders, be the doctrines of the go&s;pell or not, which &s;eeing it is to be decyded by the &s;ynod a&s;&s;embled, it will be be&s;t to attend the i&s;&s;ue thereof.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="011300_0050_0F897296769937F8">In his an&s;wer to the 10th rea&s;on, he doth only di&s;cour&s;e and finde fault with a conclu&s;ion which is of his own fram|ing (for I do not conclude that the law was only for taking notice of &s;uch as come to us, but I add al&s;o the ende of &s;uch notice, viz. for avoyding &s;uch as are to be kept out) which being all included in one parente&s;is, it is more than a &s;lip thus to mi&s;take it.</P>
<P>And whereas he chargeth me, as if I grounded the law upon no better foundation than a good intent, the reader may ea&s;ily judge that it is a meere &s;lander: For I lay down the order of the law to be, that &s;uch &s;hould not be received into our fellow&s;hip who are likely to di&s;turbe the &s;ame; and thence I inferre that this intent is lawfull and good.</P>
<P>The like ca&s;t he hath at the per&s;ua&s;ion and con&s;cience of &s;uch as are to execute this law: And here I mu&s;t make bold to a&s;ke him this que&s;tion, viz. Seeing you are bound by your oath in all cau&s;es wherein you are to give your vote for elections, &amp;c. to goe according to your con&s;cience, if then one be propounded to be cho&s;en a magi&s;trate, and you are per&s;uaded in your con&s;cience, by the be&s;t know|ledge you can get of him, that he is not fitt for that place, whether are you to give your vote for him or not? When you have an&s;wered this que&s;tion, I will replye further to you: And with all I de&s;yre the an&s;werer to take this along with him; that this law concerning the freemens oath, whereunto all the godly of this common-wealth con&s;ented, (and which referrs the judgment of per&s;ons and churches in that cau&s;e to the con&s;cience and per&s;ua&s;ion of chri&s;tian men) was never yet held to be a va&s;t and illimitted rule.</P>
<P>The An&s;werer proceeds to the objections, and lea&s;t his arguments &s;hould not reach his ayme, he &s;peakes to pre|judice the readers judgment, by averring much un&s;oundnes, &amp;c. beforehand, but I mu&s;t intreate him to make a better di&s;covery ere it be yeelded.</P>
<P>The 1&s;t objection is, that &s;ome profane per&s;ons are re|ceived and others who are religious are rejected.</P>
<P>The an&s;werer di&s;claymes this objection as none of theirs, which matters not greatly. I know from whome I heard
<PB N="96" REF="011300_0051_0F86A008DA5107B0">
it, though he did not; yet he might as well owne it, as offer to prove that &s;uch as are truly and chri&s;tianly reli|gious have been rejected, except he will denye &s;uch to be religious: But I affirme &s;till, as I did before, that I know of none &s;uch, who have been rejected, nor any &s;uch bla&s;|phemers or quarrellers (as he &s;peakes of) to have been received.</P>
<P>In his an&s;wer to my &s;olution of this objection, I only ob&s;erve this, that whereas my argument is by way of com|pari&s;ion <Q>betweene a younge prophaine per&s;on and an elder profe&s;&s;or confirmed in &s;ome errour,</Q> he gaine &s;aith the compari&s;on by introduction of Abraham, who was a ble&s;&s;ing to others; but alledgeth not any oppo&s;ite member; but &s;ure he was in a greate &s;treight, otherwi&s;e he would not have held forth the father of the faithfull as &s;uch an one, as he mu&s;t produce to an&s;wer my compari&s;on; but it well accords with his owne tenent, that he mu&s;t have leave to advance his owne partie, whatever danger or damage befall others by it.</P>
<P>After this he takes upon him to prove, <Q>that all &s;uch as are confirmed in any way of errour, are not to be de|nyed cohabitation, but are to be pittyed and reformed, for this he alledgeth two places of &s;cripture, Jude 22, 23. Gen. 16.17.</Q></P>
<P>To this I replye 1&s;t, Let it be ob&s;erved how this an|&s;wers my argument. I endeavoured to prove that &s;ome profe&s;&s;ors were to be denyed cohabitation, rather than &s;ome prophaine ones, for this rea&s;on, viz. becau&s;e they may be more dangerous. His an&s;wer is, that all &s;uch as are con|firmed in any way of errour are not to be denyed, &amp;c. and omitts that wherein the weight of the argument lies, viz. their being dangerous to publick peace. 2dly, I denye that the&s;e &s;criptures prove his propo&s;ition, for that in Jude &s;peakes nothinge of cohabitation, or confirmation in errour, nor &s;peakes he to magi&s;trates, or &s;uch as had power, to re|ceive or reject, &amp;c. and if he will bring that place to his purpo&s;e it will inferre this conclu&s;ion, that no compa&s;&s;ion is to be had of &s;uch as we may denye cohabitation unto.
<PB N="97" REF="011300_0051_0F86A008DA5107B0">
As for that, Gen. 16.12. it is as little to the purpo&s;e. I&s;maell dwelt in the hou&s;e of his brethren, but not among them; &s;o, by our law, &s;uch as we hold not fitt to dwell among us are not denyed to dwell by us.</P>
<P>Another objection is, "that by this law we reject true chri&s;tians, and &s;o con&s;equently Chri&s;t him&s;elfe."</P>
<P>The &s;olution of this objection is, that in &s;ome ca&s;es a man that is a true chri&s;tian may be rejected or denyed re|&s;idence, and yet Chri&s;t not rejected; for proof whereof I in&s;tance in diver&s;e particulars, all which he pa&s;&s;eth by, without any directe an&s;wer; but concludes, that is nothing to the law; which I mu&s;t leave to the reader to judge of, &s;eeing he brings neither rea&s;on nor &s;cripture again&s;t it, to which I may replye.</P>
<P>After this he comes to the particular occa&s;ion of the law, and here he layes about him in earne&s;t, and &s;trikes all that come in his way, magi&s;trates, elders, and all that doe walk in that way which Mr. Wheelewright hath de&s;cribed to be a way of a covenant of workes, and holds them forth as Anti|chri&s;ts; and for proof hereof alledges that in 1 John 4.1, 2, 3. where the Apo&s;tle, giving a rule to di&s;cover fal&s;e &s;pirits by, gives this as the marke, they confe&s;&s;e not that Je&s;us Chri&s;t came in the fle&s;h, and &s;uch a &s;pirit is of Antichri&s;t. How this place proves his a&s;&s;ertion I am not able to di&s;|cerne: Sure I am that &s;uch, as he ca&s;ts under a covenant of workes, doe confe&s;&s;e that Chri&s;t is come in the fle&s;h, but then I &s;ee that hereby he hath brought the cau&s;e, which he is &s;o zealous for, into &s;uch a toyle as all the &s;kill he hath cannot extricate, unle&s;&s;e (as before) he will draw in Abraham into the &s;ame e&s;tate of antichri&s;tiani&s;m; &s;eeing by that doctrine he walked in the &s;ame way of a covenant of workes, 14 yeares together, viz. while he kept Hagar, &amp;c.</P>
<P>For his an&s;wer in defence of Mr. Wheelewright his opinions, I will make no replye, but waite the &s;ucce&s;&s;e of the conference among the churches now a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t place he bringeth diver&s;e rea&s;ons to prove "that this law is mo&s;t wicked and &s;innefull."</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="011300_0052_0F86A00B86F0D330">His 1&s;t rea&s;on is, this law giveth that, without limitation, to men, which is proper to God; and &s;o is a ground of gro&s;&s;e popery; for proofe he cites Deut. 1.17. and 17.9, 10, 11.</P>
<P>To which I an&s;wer, that I have proved already that the magi&s;trates are limitted both by their church covenant and by their oath, and by the dutye of theire places, to &s;quare all their proceedings by the rule of Gods word, for the advancement of the go&s;pell and the weale publick; neither doth it cro&s;&s;e either of the places mentioned, for what&s;oever &s;entence the magi&s;trate gives, according to the&s;e limitta|tions, the judgment is the Lords, though he do it not by any rule particularly pre&s;cribed by civill authority. As for that other place in Deut. 17.9. it &s;trengthens our law, and reflects &s;harply upon &s;uch as doe oppo&s;e it; for it &s;treightly commands all per&s;ons to &s;ubmitt to the &s;entence of the judge, and to receive the expo&s;ition of the law from his mouth; &s;o as &s;uch gaine&s;ayers &s;tand guilty of pre|&s;umption in oppo&s;eing the &s;entence of the judges, before they have clearely convinced them that their &s;entence is contrary to the law of God.</P>
<P>As for that a&s;per&s;ion of popery, &amp;c. it will draw no blood; his earne&s;tnes in the cau&s;e makes him thus to ca&s;t dirt upon his oppo&s;ers, when he hath &s;pent his &s;hott.</P>
<P N="2">2. His 2d rea&s;on again&s;t this law is, that it gives libertye to the magi&s;trates to expell and reject tho&s;e who are mo&s;t eminent chri&s;tians, if they &s;uite not with the magi&s;trates di&s;po&s;ition; and thence concludes that Chri&s;t and his mem|bers will finde wor&s;e entertainment among us than the I&s;raelites did among the Egyptians and Babilonians, han Abraham and I&s;aack among the Phili&s;tines, than Lott among the Sodomites, &amp;c.</P>
<P>To this I an&s;wer, 1. His earne&s;tnes confounds his me|morye; he knows well, that this law gives no power to ex|pell any, neither doth it make the magi&s;trates di&s;po&s;ition the rule for rejecting any; but this &s;lander hath beene con|futed before. 2. For a brother in church covenant and a fellow member of &s;uch a civill body as ours, to conclude
<PB N="99" REF="011300_0052_0F86A00B86F0D330">
&s;o peremptorily of his fellow brethren, favours of much arogance and de&s;perate prejudice. If his charity can hope no better of us, but that we will deale wor&s;e with Gods people than the Pagans (and that before he hath &s;eene any experience of it) it is no marvaile if he favour &s;uch as have ranked us with the &s;ame before; onely herein he deales fairely with us, in giving us tymely warneing what to ex|pect from the imbittered mynde of &s;uch a brother; but for his argument it &s;elfe thus it &s;tands: The Egyptians, &amp;c. gave leave to Gods people, to &s;ett downe among&s;t them: But the magi&s;trates will not give leave, &amp;c. <HI>ergo,</HI> they are wor&s;e than the Egyptians, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, how&s;oever the magi&s;trates cannot &s;topp his fury, yet we &s;hall free the law from the force of his argu|ment: For except he had a&s;&s;umed thus, the magi&s;trates mu&s;t or may &amp;c. for it is nothing to the law, that they will doe &s;o, &s;eeing a magi&s;trates will may tran&s;gre&s;&s;e a good law, and if they &s;hould doe &s;o, yet I denye that it is by the liberty of the law, which I &s;hall not need further to prove, &s;eeing my denyall will bear as much weight as his affirmation.</P>
<P N="3">3. His 3d rea&s;on is, this law doth cro&s;&s;e many lawes of Chri&s;t. This he proves by enumeration of 3 particulars, Matt. 22.21. Heb. 13.2. Gal. 6.10.</P>
<P>To this I an&s;wer, and 1. to that of Matt. 22.21. Give unto Ce&s;ar the things which are Ce&s;ars. The rea&s;on lyes thus: The King hath right to plant any of his &s;ubjects among us; but we denye to let him plant &s;ome of his &s;ub|jects among us, unle&s;&s;e they plea&s;e us; <HI>ergo,</HI> we denye to Ce&s;ar, &amp;c. The propo&s;ition is fal&s;e; for I have proved before, that the King haveing given all the land within cer|taine limitts to the patentees and their a&s;&s;ociates, cannot &s;end others to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e that which he hath granted before.</P>
<P N="2">2. As for that in Heb. 13. it is nothing to the purpo&s;e; This law of the court hinders not the entertainment of &s;traingers &s;o farre as the rule of ho&s;pitalitye requires; and there is no other intended in that place.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="100" REF="011300_0053_0F86A00BF6714568">3. For that in Gal. 6. I confe&s;&s;e the hou&s;hold of faith are principally to be regarded; and it is apparent that the care of their wellfare was the only occa&s;ion and ground (next the glory of God) of the making of this law: For, the court, taking nottice how the hearts of the faithfull were &s;added by the &s;preading of diver&s;e new and unfound opinions, and the uncharitable cen&s;ures which they laye under by occa&s;ion of them, how brotherly love and com|munion decayed, how the ordinances of religion were neg|lected, and the faithfull di&s;pen&s;ers thereof (&s;ometimes more precious than fine gold) &s;lighted and reproached, through|out the whole countrey, they found it needfull to provide remedye in tyme, that it might goe well with the hou&s;hold of faith, and though the execution of this law &s;hould turne to the damage of &s;ome of this hou&s;hold, yet better it is &s;ome member &s;hould &s;uffer the evill they bring upon them|&s;elves, than that, by indulgence towards them, the whole familye of God in this countrey &s;hould be &s;cattered, if not de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>His la&s;t argument (by which we may &s;ee that he ment not to quitt the cau&s;e, &s;o long as his breath would hold) is this, This law da&s;heth again&s;t many other lawes of Chri&s;t <HI>ergo,</HI> it is mo&s;t wicked and &s;innefull.</P>
<P>To which my an&s;wer may be &s;hort, and yet &s;ufficient to with&s;tand the force of his argument. This law da&s;heth not again&s;t any law of Chri&s;t; <HI>ergo,</HI> it is ju&s;t and good.</P>

<P>I Thank you for your continued offices of love in your coun&s;aile to my &s;ervant, while the Lord granted him health, and your kindnes and re&s;pect to him in his &s;ick|nes; as the Lord &s;hall offer me opportunitie you &s;hall ever find me ready to performe the like or any other fruit of well affection for you or yours.

I wrote to you con|cerning powder that was left in the bay, the &s;tore we had here grows &s;hort, but I hope we &s;hall have noe need till next &s;pringe, until when I leave it al&s;o, only I directed my man that if he &s;aw it decaying, haveing been long kept, (though that we have here holds yet well) he &s;hould &s;ell 8 or 10 barrels of it. Concerning the la&s;t part of your letter I can yet &s;ay little, only thus much that what&s;oever tends to mutual defence and &s;hall conduce to the &s;ettling and maintaining unfained love, you may expect from me and all tho&s;e who are intre&s;ted in this place.

<P>HAD not the Almighty (who is righteous in the mid|de&s;t of mans unrighteou&s;nes) &s;tirred up certaine malicious and &s;landerous per&s;ons to defame me with impu|dent, falfe and &s;hameles reports, to my no &s;mall griefe and trouble, I had been with you before this day, knowing right well how comfortable the face of a friend is in &s;uch &s;ad conditions as yours at pre&s;ent. How I have been and am affected with tho&s;e lo&s;&s;es and cro&s;&s;es as are befallen you by your unfaithful &s;ervant, he that made the heart be&s;t knoweth.

How prone would Gods people be to have their hearts en&s;nared and taken up with the world and the riches and honors thereof, if he &s;hould not &s;ometimes &s;hew us their vanity. He that brought Job &s;o low (after he was humbled before him) ble&s;&s;ed his latter daies more than his former. We have to doe with the &s;ame God: He can doe what he will, and let this be our comfort, he will doe what is be&s;t for us: Therefore let us &s;hew forth his prai&s;e by patient &s;ubmitting to his hand, joining therewith a diligent enquiry after the cau&s;e twixt him and our&s;elves. I have too often u&s;ed a fooli&s;h proverb, I had rather be envyed than pittyed: But I finde by lamentable experience Gods word true, That none can &s;tand before envy; and there|fore prefer your condition farre before mine owne, whom I conceive to be compa&s;&s;ed about with friends.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Worthy Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR pious and good letter I received; for which I humbly thanke you. Your judicious coun&s;el therein I lovingly imbrace, as concurring fully with mine owne judgment: Hence have I not troubled the people at all with church di&s;cipline, or con&s;titutions of churches, &amp;c. but have bent my whole &s;tuddies to &s;hew them their mi&s;erable and lo&s;t e&s;tate without Chri&s;t, &amp;c. Nor have I enveyed, in the lea&s;t mea&s;ure, again&s;t the church of Eng|land (to my remembrance) but have been (and &s;till am) very fearefull to give one word of di&s;ta&s;t about tho&s;e things, but altogether do &s;eek to gaine them to Chri&s;t. True, I do acknowledge that after I had been here for the &s;pace of a month or 6 weeks, and perceiving them very &s;uper&s;titious, (performing mans invention rather than the
<PB N="112" REF="011300_0059_0F86A0139C713060">
in&s;tituted wor&s;hip of God) now, that I might gaine their good e&s;teeme of Gods pure ordinances, and make them &s;ee the evill and folly of their &s;uper&s;tition and will-wor|&s;hip, I made choi&s;e of P&s;. 19. and 7. to handle it at large: And, in one of the u&s;es of reproof, I bent my&s;elfe as &s;trong|ly as I could again&s;t the religion of the Papi&s;ts, and con|demned tho&s;e practices, which I &s;aw the people here were &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly addicted to, in that u&s;e again&s;t the Papi&s;ts; who&s;e religion I &s;hewed, at large, con&s;i&s;ted either of a new in&s;tructed wor&s;hip not mentioned in the law of God, or of Gods in&s;tituted wor&s;hip mi&s;erably abu&s;ed, either by their additions or diminutions; and &s;hewed the particulars wherein. Now (I heartily thank God for it) it took a generall good impre&s;&s;ion, excepting Mr. Vines and one more who told me I &s;truck at the church of England, though I mentioned her not. Whereupon he pre&s;&s;ed me to di&s;pute with him about one part, of baptizing infants with godfathers and godmothers; the which I was very loth to di&s;pute about; yet I &s;aw that either I mu&s;t, or el&s;e &s;it downe with &s;hame, for he had called together his whole family to heare it. Now, it plea&s;ed God &s;o to &s;trengthen me (through the riches of his mercy) that he was utterly &s;ilent; and &s;ince that time hath manife&s;ted more re&s;pect and love to me and my ma&s;ter than formerly, and doth take notes of the &s;ermons dayly, and repeateth them in his family very orderly, as I am informed.</P>

<HEAD>Copy of a Letter from Mr. Endecott to Governor Winthrop, about La Tour.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Deare Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am glad that La Tour hath not ayd from us; and I could wi&s;h hee might not have any from the &s;hipps: For as long as La Tour and Daulney are oppo&s;ites they will weaken one another. If La Tour &s;hould prevail again&s;t him we &s;hall undoubtedly have an ill neighbour. His father and him&s;elfe, as I am informed, have &s;hed the blood of &s;ome Engli&s;h already, and taken away a pinnace and goods from Mr. Allerton. It were (I think) good, that that bu&s;ines were cleared before hee had either ayd or libertie to hire &s;hipps, yea, or to depart.</P>
<P>Sir, it is not the manner abroad to &s;uffer &s;traingers to view forts or fortifications, as it &s;eems the&s;e French have done. I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, that I feare we &s;hall have little comfort in having any thing to doe with the&s;e idolatrous French. The countrey hereabouts is much troubled that they are &s;o entertayned and have their libertie as they have to bring their &s;oldiers a&s;hore, and to &s;uffer them to trayne their men. And great jealou&s;ies there are, that it is not Daulney that is aymed at; &s;eeing &s;uch a &s;trength will neither &s;ute &s;uch a poore de&s;igne, and La Tour a man of weake e&s;tate, as it is &s;aid. Wherefore, other mens hands are employed, and pur&s;es too, for &s;ome other &s;ervice. But I leave all the&s;e things to your &s;erious con&s;iderations, de&s;ireing the Lord to guide you therein to the glorie and peace of the churches here, to who&s;e grace I commit you and humblie re&s;t,</P>

<SALUTE>Right worthy Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Under&s;tand by Mr. Parker that you have written to me by Mr. Shurt, which as yet I have not received. It cannot be unknown to you the fears that we are in &s;ince La Tours promi&s;e of ayd from you; for my part, I thought fitt to certifye foe much unto you, and I doubt not only the&s;e parts which are naked, but all N. E. will finde D'Aulnay a &s;courge. He hath long wayted (with the expence of neer 800<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> per month) for the apprehending of this &s;upply, and if all his hopes &s;hall be fru&s;trated through your ayd, you may conceive where he will &s;eeke for &s;atisfaction. If a thorough worke could be made, that he might utterly be extirpated, I &s;hould like it well; other|wi&s;e it cannot be thought but a &s;oldier and a gentleman will &s;eeke to revenge him&s;elf, having 500 men, 2 &s;hipps, a galley, and 3 pinna&s;es, well provided: Be&s;ides you may plea&s;e to conceive in what manner he now be&s;iedges La Tour, his &s;hipps lye on the S. W. part of the i&s;land at the entrance of St. Johns river, within which &s;ide is only the entrance for &s;hipps, on the N. E. lye his pinna&s;es; it can|not be conceived but he will fortifye the i&s;land, which will debarr the entrance of any of your &s;hipps and force them backe, &s;hewing the will, having not the power, to hurt him.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hall for England in this &s;hipp, I am not as yet certayn, which makes me forbear to be large at this tyme, or to de&s;ire your commands thither. Thus in ha&s;te I re&s;t,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Much honoured in the Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THough we doe, and may truly, profe&s;&s;e our&s;elves to be both unfit and unwilling to interpo&s;e in a matter of &s;uch &s;tate and weight, as we conceive this French af|fair to bee, yet the honour we owe to the religion we pro|fe&s;&s;e, the loyalty we beare to our native country, e&s;pecially in its pre&s;ent condition and the reference wherein it &s;tands to the kingdome of France, out of re&s;pect to the reputa|tion of our government and governors, our tender care of the &s;ouls and lives of &s;uch as are committed to the tru&s;t thereof, the eye of care we ought to have upon our friends in the ea&s;t, our regard to our chri&s;tian confede|rates, &s;o lately combined with us, in confidence of our piety and wi&s;dome, and the religious di&s;charge of our own con&s;ciences and duties, will not permit us to be &s;ilent, &s;o long as there is any roome left for us to &s;peake. We have littel hope to revoke re&s;olutions &s;oe farre tran&s;acted and ripned, but we pre&s;ume it &s;hall not be taken ami&s;&s;e, if we labour to wa&s;h our hands wholly of this de&s;igne, and what ill con&s;equences &s;oever it may produce. The rea&s;ons moving us hereto, are our deepe feares that the &s;tated rules of undertaking warres, either by proper and direct enter|prize, or by lending ayd, have not been &s;o duly ob&s;erved, as we could wi&s;h.</P>
<P N="1">1. The grounds of warre ought to be ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary. For the ju&s;tice of this warre by la Tour agayn&s;t Daulnay, we conceive that all the light and information New Eng|land hath, or may probably receive, cannot be &s;ufficient for us to determine it po&s;&s;itively; we under&s;tand it hath beene variou&s;ly judged in the courts of France, one while for Daulnay, another while for la Tour, and it is not impo&s;|&s;ible that la Tour hath now rather outfriended than out|pleaded Daulnay; we &s;hall therefore runne into an un|chri&s;tian
<PB N="116" REF="011300_0061_0F86A0175875FE50">
premunire of pre&s;umption if we re&s;olve upon &s;uch an enterprize with an irre&s;olved faith, <HI>in cau&s;&acirc; dubi&acirc; bellum non e&s;t &s;u&s;cipiendum.</HI> For the nece&s;&s;ity of it, it mu&s;t either be in point of charity towards de la Tour or upon &s;ome engageing intere&s;t of our owne. For any bond of charity, we conceive the &s;peech of the prophet to Jeho|&s;haphat, 2 Chron. 19.2. and of Solomon, Proverbs 26.17. not only di&s;charge but &s;trongly prohibite us. 1. For our owne intere&s;t, if it be cleare that Daulnay hath offered us &s;uch great wrong, as invites us to a warre (which we much que&s;tion, for it mu&s;t be <HI>atrox injuria)</HI> we &s;uppo&s;e it would &s;tand more with the honor of our religion and plan|tation, to proceed profe&s;&s;edly and orderly again&s;t him, then for us Engli&s;h to become but margent notes upon a French text, which to us is as yet but apocripha; and to undertake him upon more certaine grounds, and at a more &s;ea&s;onable time when he doth le&s;s expect us, and is not &s;o well provided for us as now he is. Warrs are extreme remedies and are not to be enterpri&s;ed unle&s;&s;e their cau&s;es will beare out all manner of effects and con&s;equences, whe|ther per&s;onall or nationall, which may en&s;ue. And what may not en&s;ue, if either of the nations to whom we belong will comment upon our action in a &s;tate language? And how apt a time this is for mi&s;con&s;tructions we cannot be ignorant. The &s;pirit of warre is &s;chola&s;tick and je&s;uitical, traver&s;ing the very po&s;itions and principles, which peace hath held both dogmatical and irrefragable, even to the wonderment of rational men. We are informed that Daulnay de&s;ires our friend&s;hip, and we are inclined to believe that if it did as well become him to appeal to our judgment as it ill be|&s;eemes us to expect it, he would not refu&s;e to ca&s;t him&s;elf upon our compromi&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. Warres ought not to be undertaken without the coun&s;ell and command of the &s;upreame authority, whence expeditions i&s;&s;ue. It is not hard to &s;ay, the pre&s;ent re|ference betweene the kingdomes of England and France con&s;idered, that the &s;ubjects of the one ought not to wage warre again&s;t the other without a publick commi&s;&s;ion of
<PB N="117" REF="011300_0061_0F86A0175875FE50">
&s;tate, unle&s;&s;e it be in defence upon a &s;udden a&s;&s;ault: Nei|ther do we yet heare that La Tour him&s;elf hath any &s;uch commi&s;&s;ion for this his action; though if he had it were little to us. It is a rule ob&s;erved among&s;t confederates, that during any league of peace betweene them, one friend may not ayd another again&s;t any part of his pro|vince, till that part be pro&s;cribed by the authority of a generall a&s;&s;embly whereof it is a member, and the confe|derates a&s;&s;ured thereof in a &s;tate way. The breach of this rule is a breach of league. Publick actions of ho&s;ti|lity worke farre and wide, having their national and con|federal influences and con&s;equences. The daggers we draw here may happly prove &s;words in Chri&s;tendome for ought we know.</P>
<P>But this de&s;igne, whatever the cau&s;e was, &s;eemed &s;hy even of our New-Engli&s;h Coun&s;el to warrant and guide it: How clo&s;ely it concernes the peace and &s;afety of the whole plantation may ea&s;ily be conjectured, and how farre it declined the advice thereof in a repre&s;entative cour&s;e we are very &s;orry to con&s;ider or mention.</P>
<P>We dare not &s;o much impeach the honour of the ad|vi&s;ours as to think they would vaile the action with this, that they only permit and give way to volunteirs; for who knows not this to be a rule of &s;tate, that Not to for|bid, when there is notice and power, is to bidd.</P>
<P>This were al&s;o to proclaime our weaknes, in pro&s;trating our government to nothing; for who is ignorant that To permit voluntiers to i&s;&s;ue out in ayd of a friend is never done without an act of &s;tate, where any &s;tate is?</P>
<P>Daulnay, nor France, are not &s;o feeble in their intel|lectuals as to deeme it no act of &s;tate, when, upon con&s;ul|tation with &s;ome of our chiefe per&s;ons, our men are &s;uf|fered, if not incouraged, to goe forth with our provi&s;ion and munition upon the de&s;igne: We do therefore wonder that our people, having no warrant from authority, will, of their own heads, runne &s;uch a hazzard of their &s;oules and lives, as can neither looke for any prayers or thankes for their good &s;ucce&s;&s;e, nor any &s;uccours if it &s;ares ill, and
<PB N="118" REF="011300_0062_0F86A0182AC40750">
as it may fall out, rather call for the cur&s;es of their friends from whom they went, and of po&s;terity yet unborne, and yet the&s;e poore men pre&s;ume that if Daulnay &s;hould &s;ay, as the King of Egypt to Jo&s;iah, what have I to do with thee, thou King of Judah? I come not out again&s;t thee this day, but again&s;t the hou&s;e with whome I have warre, or if they &s;hould &s;hed innocent blood or feel their owne &s;oules dropping &s;uddenly into hell, they had their warrant from the Coun&s;el and countenance of tho&s;e upon whom they might and ought to confide. It were to be wi&s;hed they had been taught the Germane proverb, which &s;ayth, He that lo&s;eth his life in an unnece&s;&s;ary quarrel dyes the Devill's martyr. Had they had the voyces of the people with them, it had beene better than nothing; but that wind &s;eemes to us to blow &s;trong in the teeth of their voyage. We &s;hall pre&s;ume to propound the&s;e que&s;tions. 1. If Daulnay or France &s;hall hereafter demand any of them from us as enemies, or murtherers, whether will our court protect or deliver them? 2. If any of the parents or wives &s;hall require their lives at our hands, who &s;hall an|&s;wer them? 3. If any of their widdowes or children &s;hall require &s;u&s;tenance, or any maimed &s;ouldier in this expedi|tion call for maintenance, who &s;hall give it them? or if taken captive and made &s;laves, who &s;hall re&s;cue or redeem them?</P>
<P N="3">3. The ends of warre ought to be religious: What glory is intended hereby to God we &s;ee not, and how our peace &s;hall hereby be &s;ettled we fore&s;ee not, but &s;u&s;pect it will rather be a beginning than an end of our troubles and feares, if we doe not wholly &s;uppre&s;&s;e Daulnay, we may be &s;ure of it. He is already very &s;trong, and if our &s;hips and munition fall into his hand, it will demini&s;h from us, and incourage, exa&s;perate and &s;trengthen him.</P>
<P>If La Tour prevaile he is like to cavill with our men for &s;ome mi&s;carriages, or we with him for non-payment. The pa&s;&s;age of our &s;hips to and from England hath hither|to beene quiet and &s;afe, in regard of the French, but we cannot &s;o expect it hereafter, if they &s;hall meete with any of La Tours or Daulnayes &s;pecial friends, or at lea&s;t with
<PB N="119" REF="011300_0062_0F86A0182AC40750">
the friends of &s;uch of them as we &s;hall &s;eeme to wrong. <HI>Bellum contra ho&s;tem non e&s;t &s;u&s;cipiendum cum periculo rei|publicae,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="4">4. Undertakings of warrs ought to be probably fea&s;able, but this &s;eemes not &s;oe to us. We learne out of the Ea&s;t, be an eye witne&s;&s;e, that Daulnay is very &s;trong, in artillery, men and munition, at land, and very well provided at &s;ea, in&s;omuch that &s;ome of the Ea&s;t have con&s;ulted to repayre to him in his ayd, lea&s;t he &s;hould upon revenge annoy and ruine them; he is reported to be a valiant, prudent and experienced &s;ouldier and commander, and defendants have great advantages of a&s;&s;aylants, &s;oe that, we feare, our &s;heep have ha&s;tned to their &s;laughter.</P>
<P N="5">5. La&s;tly, The manner of enterpri&s;ing warre calls for many rules, according to &s;cripture and the cu&s;tome of re|ligious and ingenuous nations, as to &s;ummon and give warning before they &s;trike: To heare what the defendant can pleade for the ju&s;tice of his cau&s;e, to offer termes of peace with equal articles, and to give &s;pecial cautionary commi&s;&s;ions and commands how farre to per&s;i&s;t in ayd, and when to de&s;i&s;t; but we neither can &s;end fitt men for &s;uch charges, nor can we pre&s;cribe &s;uch directions, without a profe&s;&s;ed imbarquing our&s;elves in the action; which, it &s;eems, is wholly declined on our parts.</P>
<P>We therefore trouble you no further, only we itterate our prote&s;tation that we are and de&s;ire to be held cleare and innocent of this undertakeing, and</P>

I am much grieved to heare what I heare; and I &s;ee more of the &s;pirits of &s;ome men than ever I thought I &s;hould &s;ee. The Lord rebuke Satan. Sir, be of good comfort, I doubt not but our God that is in heaven will carry you above all the injuries of men; for I know you would not permitt any thinge, much le&s;s act in any thinge that might tend to the lea&s;t damage of this people, and this I am a&s;&s;ured of, that mo&s;t of Gods people here about us are of the &s;ame minde. The rumours of the countrey, you know, they ri&s;e out of ignorance principallie, and much out of fears; wherefore, I pray you, let there be &s;ati&s;|faction given as &s;oone as you convenientlie can, in the way you wrote me of; for I finde the &s;pirits of of men in this countrie are too quick and forward. I cannot excu&s;e my|&s;elfe, yet I ble&s;&s;e God, not to wronge you, but according to the information and light I received from you, I acted publiquelie &s;o farre forth as to break downe all prejudices again&s;t your&s;elfe or the re&s;t that advi&s;ed with you. Our prayers here are publiquely and privately for a good i&s;&s;ue of it, and that continually. I hope God will looke upon your &s;inceritie in mercie and will heare our reque&s;ts.</P>
<P>I &s;ee no good u&s;e of &s;uch prote&s;tations as I heare of, but they may prove more dangerous than the French bu|&s;ines by farre, if our God hinder not. However, it will be of u&s;e (God directing) to make a holy u&s;e of it.</P>
<P>Touching my coming to Bo&s;ton about the Dutch bu|&s;ines, I cannot &s;ee how it will be of any u&s;e: For the me&s;&s;enger cannot have a determinate an&s;wer till the ge|nerall court, and to morrow we have appointed many of the towne for the working of the fort, which, unle&s;s I be there, there will not any thing be done, and I received not your letter till this day after our lecture.</P>

<HEAD>The Governor's An&s;wer to the Ip&s;wich Letter about La Tour.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen and beloved brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is not unknowne to you, that (through the Lords gracious a&s;&s;i&s;tance) I have thankfully imbraced and &s;ubmitted unto the wi&s;e and loveing advi&s;e and admonitions of any of my brethren; and truly it is &s;till my de&s;ire &s;o to doe: And this (I hope) may well &s;tand (upon this pre|&s;ent occa&s;ion) with the maintenance of what is good and righteous in our cau&s;e, about this French bu&s;ines, and with that faithfulnes that is againe required of me towards you all, whom I love honour and reverence in the Lord. And though I have lately written to you about this matter, yet that which I have &s;ince received from you calls upon me for &s;ome addition and an&s;wer al&s;o; which I do not with any purpo&s;e to contend, but in di&s;charge of my con&s;cience and duty of my place, and let the Lord do what &s;eemes good in his eyes.</P>
<P>The prote&s;tation, which was directed to my&s;elfe fir&s;t, but came to me through many hands (and &s;o it &s;eemes it
<PB N="122" REF="011300_0064_0F86A019B66D0F48">
was intended by you, being &s;ent un&s;ealed) was entertained of me as proceeding from your zealous care for the publick &s;afety: But, con&s;idered in it&s;elfe, it is an act of an exorbi|tant nature, out of rule, out of &s;ea&s;on, and of dangerous con&s;equence. Such prote&s;tations are publique and judicial acts, and therefore mu&s;t be warranted by &s;ome authority, which appears not in this. I know no law, order, cu&s;tome or &amp;c. that can give power to 3 a&s;&s;i&s;tants, by any &s;uch publick in&s;trument, to contradict the proceedings of a greater number, the Governor al&s;o being one of them; and how it will con&s;i&s;t with the obligation of a freeman is al&s;o con&s;iderable. Suppo&s;e now, 3 other a&s;&s;i&s;tants and &s;o many elders &s;hould prote&s;t again&s;t your prote&s;tation, it would be of equal force, and as warrantable for ought I knowe. Againe, it comes not like Solomons apples of gold if plates of &s;ilver; it is <HI>con&s;ilium po&s;t factum:</HI> Whereas, if you had &s;ent it in &s;ea&s;on, it might perchance have &s;topped tho&s;e proceedings which you &s;o much complaine again&s;t; whereas, at pre&s;ent (you know and may &s;ee) you do but beate the ayre, and &s;trive for that which (you are &s;ure) you cannot reach. It is al&s;o of dangerous con&s;equence in the&s;e re&s;pects. 1. It may be a pre&s;ident for others to at|tempt the like in any ca&s;e; for you take upon you the &s;ole judgment of your owne act, and if others may have the like liberty, they may countenance their oppo&s;ition to authority, as well in evill cau&s;es as in good. 2. It blowes a trumpet to divi&s;ion and di&s;&s;ention among&s;t our&s;elves, magi&s;trates prote&s;ting again&s;t magi&s;trates, elders again&s;t elders, blameing, condemning, expo&s;eing brethren to the peoples cur&s;es, and ca&s;ting them down to hell it&s;elfe; and all this mu&s;t be indured, while we walk after the light God affords us from his owne word, and the pre&s;idential acts of former times, and of our owne generall court (as will be expre&s;&s;ed hereafter) whereas the way of God, and of order, and of peace, had beene to have referred your grievance to the generall court, and not by &s;uch an un|warrantable prote&s;tation and outcry again&s;t your brethren, to incite the people again&s;t them; whereof, if any evill
<PB N="123" REF="011300_0064_0F86A019B66D0F48">
effect &s;hould follow, your prote&s;tation of innocencie would afford you little comfort or defence. 3. This is the ready way to ha&s;ten upon us the evill &s;o much feared: For if Daulnay under&s;tand our divi&s;ions to be &s;uch, as he is like to have a party among&s;t our&s;elves, (as you declare your intelligence to be) this may imboulden him to attempt that again&s;t us which, otherwi&s;e, he dared not have done. It is al&s;o again&s;t the rule of ju&s;tice, your owne plea on Daul|nays behalfe, for you pa&s;&s;e &s;entence and publi&s;h it without calling us to an&s;wer: If may be one or two of you have accidentally heard us &s;peake &s;omewhat about it, but did you ever enquire of us, if we had any more to &s;ay for our &s;elves, why judgment &amp;c. For you will find we have more to &s;ay for our &s;elves than you formerly heard, and it is a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, if you had power to be our judges, you had the &s;ame to require our an&s;wer. I intreate you to call to mind that beaten rule of equity, <HI>Qui aliquid &s;ta|tuit parte inaudit&acirc; alter&acirc;,</HI> &amp;c. We are condemned in court, in country, by private tongues and by publick edict, and never a&s;ked, Why have you done this? and all this &s;o carryed on, and un&s;ea&s;onably di&s;pen&s;ed as no man can tell (nor do your&s;elves propound) what you would have, or how it may tend to any publick good or prevention of that great danger which you &s;uppo&s;e to hang over us; except it may be conceived that, either Daulnay will be pacified with a prote&s;tation, or the people will be &s;tirred up to &s;acrifice &s;ome of us to make their owne peace. You &s;ay, indeed, you will hereby be innocent of all the evill that may in&s;ue, &amp;c. Amen, &s;ay I; but &s;urely wi&s;e men will not believe that &s;uch a prote&s;tation will acquit you, either before God or men: No more than if one of the magi&s;trates <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> court while a man is con|demned, and after he is executed &s;hall tender a prote&s;ta|tion of his di&s;&s;ent from the &s;entence. And truly (brethren) you might have dealt a little more tenderly with us, for &s;uch &s;aileings as you have apprehended in our coun&s;ells, being the fruite but of a few houres con&s;ultation; &s;eeing your&s;elves, (upon &s;o many weekes deliberation) could not

free your owne acts from &s;uch mi&s;carriage as you &s;ee your prote&s;tation, out of date and out of cour&s;e, doth hould forth.</P>
<P>This I thought needfull to tender to your wi&s;e and chri&s;tian con&s;ideration, concerning your prote&s;tation in ge|nerall: Somewhat I mu&s;t &s;ay to your arguments, be&s;ides what may concerne them in my former writings. But, fir&s;t, you may plea&s;e to con&s;ider, that it cannot be denyed but that the Governor, a&s;&s;i&s;ted with &s;ome of the magi|&s;trates, may take order for &s;uch &s;udden affaires of the &s;tate as either need not, or cannot, &s;tay the a&s;&s;embling of the general court; of which &s;ort, we conceived this was (the rea&s;ons you may &s;ee in my former writing) and when, in &s;uch ca&s;es, we have proceeded according to our be&s;t &s;kill and judgment, we are to be excu&s;ed, and &s;o it was wont to be: And the generall court &s;eemes lately to have in|larged this tru&s;t, when, by the order of (4) 1641, it gives power, out of court, to any 3 magi&s;trates to do that which may occa&s;ion a warre, with the Indians, as likely as this with the French: For they may give commi&s;&s;ion to any ma&s;ter to right him&s;elfe upon the Indians, for his fugitive &s;ervant. By like authority it was that &s;ome of us di&s;armed the Indians and impri&s;oned &s;ome of them, upon the late &s;u&s;picion: And although it was conceived to be full of danger, and proved trouble&s;ome and chargeable, yet wee were not reproved for it. Other in&s;tances might be brought, but in tho&s;e times, indeed, when &s;uch prote&s;ta|tions were not in u&s;e. Now, in this ca&s;e of the French, wherein the onely doubt was, not whether wee &s;hould in|gage our&s;elves in a warre with La Toure again&s;t Daulney, or not; for, we know that neither the magi&s;trates nor the generall court it &s;elfe could determine that,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No War could be declared without the con&s;ent of the united Colonies&punc;</NOTE> but whether it were &s;afer or more ju&s;t and honourable for us to &s;top the cour&s;e of God's providence, offering us opportunity to &s;ave a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed neighbour, to weaken a dangerous ene|my without our chardge or engagement, or to &s;uffer it to go on freely in its owne cour&s;e. Of the&s;e two we judged the la&s;t to be be&s;t, &amp;c. And of this opinion &s;ome of us &s;hall &s;till be untill we &s;ee &s;tronger arguments again&s;t it, than as yet we have met with.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="011300_0065_0F86A01A34D3AA98">Now for your arguments, (whereof &s;ome concerne the preceedings, others the con&s;equences) I will pa&s;&s;e by that of Jeho&s;aphat as no parallel to our ca&s;e; and &s;ee if I can free us from that of Prov. 26. And here it may be fir&s;t ob&s;erved, that he &s;peaks of one that pa&s;&s;eth by, viz. that had no calling or invitation to deale in it. But 2, I will &s;hew that this &s;trife betweene La Tour and Daulnay doth neerly concerne us: and fir&s;t in point of duty, in that our di&s;tre&s;&s;ed neighbour calls to us for help; a &s;peciall pro|vidence of God and his owne good opinion of our chari|tablene&s;s, brought him to us, for &s;ome ends, and no other appearing to us, it was our duty to attend his; nor were we in this ca&s;e to &s;tand upon the ju&s;tice of the quarrell betweene them, no more than Abraham did when Lot and the Sodomites were in pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;e; nor than any man would doe, if he &s;aw his neighbour under foote and in danger to be killed, he would fir&s;t re&s;cue him from dan|ger, ere he enquire of the cau&s;e. And how we might withould &s;uch helpe from La Tour which that providence which brought him hither, might here offer him in his apparent di&s;tre&s;&s;e and danger of utter ruine, I profe&s;&s;e I &s;ee no warrant.</P>
<P>For cleareing of this point I de&s;ire you &s;eriou&s;ly to con|&s;ider an argument or two. 1, He is either a neighbour or no neighbour. If he be not a neighbour, then is he in no relation to us by the &s;econd table, and then we may rob, beate, or kill him without breach of any commandment. But if he be a neighbour then mu&s;t we do to him in his di&s;tre&s;&s;e, as we would have others do to us in ours. 2dly, If he be one of tho&s;e ALL, to whom by the rule of the Apo&s;tle we mu&s;t doe good (as he mu&s;t needs be, if he be either of the hou&s;hould of faith or out of it) then that is the good we mu&s;t do to him, which he hath mo&s;t pre&s;ent neede of; and that we may not withould from him, when it is in our hands to give it him, Prov. 3.27. I pray you con&s;ider the place. 3dly, If my neighbours or mine ene|mies oxe be in that &s;tate as he cannot get to his place without my helpe, I mu&s;t helpe him to his place, Exod.
<PB N="126" REF="011300_0066_0F86A01D75A54E90">
23.4. much rather my neighbour him&s;elfe; and therefore La Tour and his company being now before us in that condition, we ought to helpe him hence. The&s;e are plain and general rules and will not beare di&s;tinctions of prote&s;|tant and papi&s;t: For the morall law being given to man by nature was given to him as man, not as man &s;o and &s;o qualifyed, and therefore when it requires duty from him, it requires it as from a man &s;imply; and when it pro|pounds man as an object of this duty, it propounds him al&s;o &s;imply con&s;idered without di&s;tinction of good or bad, chri&s;tian or heathen, &amp;c. and our Saviour inforceth this by propounding the example of our heavenly father, who cau&s;eth the &s;un to &s;hine upon the ju&s;t and unju&s;t, &amp;c. and commands us to follow his example. And the go&s;pell makes this difference only, that in que&s;tion of priority, or nece&s;&s;i|ty of neglect of one, the faithfull mu&s;t be preferred. Therefore let us &s;ee &s;omething of like authority to di&s;|pen&s;e with the&s;e rules, or el&s;e we mu&s;t conclude, that this (&s;o farr as we deale in it) is a thing that concernes us. 2dly, As it concerns us in point of duty, &s;o doth it al&s;o in point of danger. I have &s;hewed in my former writing, how Daulnay hath dealt with us and our neighbours, when he was weak, what principles he is acted by, and what pretences he hath again&s;t us; and all hi&s;tories teach us that the ambition and covetou&s;nes of conquerours and &s;poylers, hath always increa&s;ed with their power: And &s;hall we not believe that Daulnay onely will be more calmed and moderated by acce&s;&s;e of 200 &s;oldiers, and 4 or 5000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> yearely revenue: Let the latin proverb be attended as well us the Germaine, and that will tell us that <HI>res no&s;tra agitur, paries cum proximus ardet.</HI> I may &s;trengthen this con|cernment by a late Germaine hi&s;tory. When the bi&s;hop of Spiers had begun to rai&s;e a &s;trong fortification upon his owne territories, the late Palatine of Rhine demoli&s;hed it by force of armes in a time of peace, becau&s;e it might be dangerous to him if warr &s;hould ari&s;e. And the Lacede|monians being in league with the Athenians (their owne city being unwalled) would not &s;uffer the Athenians to
<PB N="127" REF="011300_0066_0F86A01D75A54E90">
wall theirs, becau&s;e it concerned them in point of advan|tage. And it hath beene u&s;ual for the States of Europe to interpo&s;e in quarrells of their neighbour States, when they have concerned them but in point of danger onely. Now for your di&s;cour&s;e about our di&s;tinction betweene commanding and not forbidding, let the di&s;tinction be rightly &s;tated as it concerns our practi&s;e, and not as you would put upon us, and we hope it will hould &s;o well, as neither the advi&s;ers nor the actors &s;hall neede to be a&s;ham|ed to owne it. We di&s;claime to have any hand in yield|ing leave to any of ours to go make warr upon Daulnay, but this we owne and no more, that we gave leave to &s;uch as could be hyred, &amp;c. to accompany La Tour and to con|duct him to his owne place. And &s;uch a permi&s;&s;ion at this (though it were a commi&s;&s;ion to this purpo&s;e) we &s;tand &s;till to maintaine is no undertaking of warr, nor act of ho&s;tility, but a meere liberty of commerce, and if any blood &s;hed &s;hould follow upon it, it is accidentall and not depending uppon this as any cau&s;e of it. Nor is it any ju&s;t provocation of warr, or any breach of peace, nor &s;o accounted among civil &s;tates. I &s;hall cleare it by an in|&s;tance or two both private and public. If I have a neigh|bour within a few miles of me &s;u&s;pected to be a robber, if I &s;end my &s;ervant to beate him and he doth &s;o, I am a tre&s;pa&s;&s;er; if he kill him, I am a murderer. But if a tra|veller comes by and tells me that he hath a chardge about him, and he is afraid to goe alone on his journey for feare of &s;uch man, and de&s;ires me to let my &s;ervant go with him (if he be willing) though it may be dangerous to his life, and may al&s;o prove danger to mee or mine from &s;uch robber: And if the traveller be now &s;ett upon by this robber and my &s;ervant kills him, we may both ju&s;tify it.</P>
<P>I will give another in&s;tance. A merchant of Spaine being in London, by leave of the King of England, hires a London &s;hip to tran&s;port him and his goods into Spaine; upon the way, a Holland man of war meetes and fights with him, and men are &s;laine on both &s;ides, yet without any breach of peace on either &s;ide, or any act of ho&s;tility in
<PB N="128" REF="011300_0067_0F86A01EA58C2EC0">
the King of England, as it would have beene if he had granted a commi&s;&s;ion to a&s;&s;ault the Hollander: So that you may &s;ee there is a wide difference betweene giveing commi&s;&s;ion to fight and giveing leave to be hyred to guard or tran&s;port. So as you mu&s;t needs have beene mi&s;taken in the right &s;tatinge of the di&s;tinction, or el&s;e I cannot conceive what your apprehen&s;ions &s;hould be of the Engli&s;h and Iri&s;h and Scotti&s;h, who in &s;o greate numbers, for the&s;e many years, have &s;erved the States again&s;t the Spaniards, and the Spaniards again&s;t the States, the Swedes again&s;t the Emperor, and <HI>e contra,</HI> without any breach of the peace between tho&s;e nations. But, admit &s;uch a permi&s;&s;ion were again&s;t a rule of &s;tate; yet, if that rule of &s;tate be again&s;t the rule of charity, it will not be hard to judge which mu&s;t give place. I will conclude this argument with that which I touch|ed in my former writing. That which is lawful for a private per&s;on to do, in the way of his calling, the magi&s;trate (if he judge it expedient, or not hurtfull to the commonwealth) ought to furder, or not to hinder him in it. But it is lawful for the owners and ma&s;ters of &s;hipps, and is in the way of their calling, to be hyred by La Tour, to convey him to his rightfull habitation, and we judge it no way hurtfull but advantagious to this commonwealth; there|fore we did well, according to the duty of our office, in yielding leave to them, and in not hindering them. And it is no &s;ufficient plea again&s;t it, to &s;ay that we know not the ju&s;tice of his cau&s;e; for that will not concerne us in this ca&s;e (and yet we do know it in good mea&s;ure) But if our &s;hipps &s;hall be oppo&s;ed in their lawfull cour&s;e, the ju&s;|tice of their cau&s;e will lye in that: As for example: A man travaileing in a waggon in England, and carrying his goods with him, his creditor &s;ets upon the waggon to take his debtors goods from him by force, the waggoner may defend him and his goods, being now in his charge, with|out any re&s;pect to the former ingagement; for the ju&s;tice of his cau&s;e ari&s;eth upon another ground. Neither is there any need to &s;end to Daulnay before they goe (no, though they went of purpo&s;e to fight with him) for be&s;ides divers
<PB N="129" REF="011300_0067_0F86A01EA58C2EC0">
examples in &s;cripture to warrant the forbearance of it, the rule in Deut. 20.10. gives other direction: When thou come&s;t <HI>neere to</HI> a city to fight again&s;t it, thou &s;halt &s;end to offer peace, &amp;c. This point being thus cleared, that we have not enterpri&s;ed any warre in this our pro|ceeding, all your complaints again&s;t us, and all your argu|ments tending that way do fall to the ground. This is not the ca&s;e, neither are we the men, and therefore I &s;hall not need to examine your rea&s;ons and allegations again&s;t &s;uch; nor am I willing to mention the&s;e pa&s;&s;adges wherein our power &s;eemes to be &s;o much &s;lighted. I dare not believe that you intended all that is held forth in them. I looke at your queries al&s;o as rai&s;ed upon the &s;ame mi&s;taken grounds, which being now cleared to you, you will ea&s;ily re&s;olve your&s;elves about them. And yet this I will pro|pound to your con&s;ideration, which may be a full an&s;wer to them all in the mo&s;t knotty con&s;truction, viz. If our brethren &s;hould erre in theire way and thereby bring them &s;elves into di&s;tre&s;&s;e, yet (if we mu&s;t pardon them upon their repentance) &s;ure we may not de&s;ert them, nor hide our eyes from theire mi&s;ery. If any of our confederates (through humane infirmity) &s;hould, again&s;t their covenant, bring a ju&s;t warre upon them&s;elves, yet if they call to us for helpe, and tender them&s;elves to equall &s;atisfaction, we mu&s;t not leave them to de&s;truction. No relation among&s;t men could &s;tand or be u&s;efull, if meere errour (which we are all continually &s;ubject to) might di&s;&s;olve it, or ob&s;truct the vitall &s;pirit which &s;hould breathe in it.</P>
<P>Whereas you object that, in this permi&s;&s;ion, we make the &s;tate but a cypher: I an&s;wer, the &s;tate hath the &s;ame influence into this which it hath into other merchants voyages, by a general and implicit con&s;ent, which may be &s;ufficient in &s;o free a &s;tate as ours is; where there is no re&s;traint upon per&s;ons or &s;hips (but upon &s;peciall occa&s;ion) they goe and come at their liberty.</P>
<P>Now for the point of danger. I conceive, fir&s;t, the rule of the Apo&s;tle Peter will hould even in this ca&s;e; while we do well we are not to be frighted with any terrour. Againe, there is no cour&s;e or voyage undertaken by us, but
<PB N="130" REF="011300_0068_0F86A01F22F96A38">
it may expo&s;e the undertakers to perill, and may occa&s;ion di&s;plea&s;ure and danger to us from abroad; but &s;uch dan|gers have not hitherto deterred us from any probable way of our &s;afety or advantage; nor have we &s;u&s;tained any harme hitherto, by ca&s;ting our&s;elves upon the Lord and his good providence, in &s;uch ca&s;es. I will remember you of &s;ome. When we fir&s;t &s;et up reformation in our church way, did not this expo&s;e us to as greate an hazard as we could run, both from abroad and at home? Did not our friends in England, many of them, forewarne us of it ere we came away? Did not others &s;end letters after us, to de|terre us from it? Did not &s;ome among our&s;elves (and tho&s;e no meane ones) inculcate our inevitable dangers at home, from no &s;mall company left out of church fellow&s;hip, and civill offices, and freedome hitherto? Yet we tru&s;ted in God (though there appeared no meanes of &s;afety) and went on our way; and the Lord hath &s;till pre&s;erved us and fru&s;trated all councells and attempts again&s;t us. Againe, when upon grievous complaints again&s;t us to the Lords of the Privy Coun&s;el, of &s;uch civil innovations among&s;t us as we could not ju&s;tify by the laws of that &s;tate, a &s;trict order and command was &s;ent to us to deliver up our patent, or el&s;e to expect to have it fetched by force, what greater danger could be towards us than appeared in not obeying of this command? Yet we had then courage enough to returne an an&s;wer without our patent. When we undertooke a warre again&s;t the Pequots, which no ne|ce&s;&s;ity put us upon, but only in point of con&s;cience (they had done us no injury) on others behalfe, there were more objections (in point of dangerous con&s;equences) again&s;t that, than again&s;t this; our friends of Plimouth complained of it, and wrote to us accordingly; &s;o did our friends of Con|necticot, laying forth the dangers we had expo&s;ed them unto by it, wi&s;hing we had forborne to a fitter &s;ea&s;on; but neither of them prote&s;ting again&s;t it: Yet, in due time, the Lords hand appeared in it, to the good of the whole country, and we felt but little of tho&s;e great dangers which were ju&s;tly to be feared. Our intelligence was believed, which we heard long &s;ince, and hath been more certainly

confirmed of late, that the je&s;uitical State<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">They were in great fear of the French when they &s;ettled, under Richlieu, at Port Royal and afterwards, when D'Aulnay came to Penob&s;cot. See <HI>Ma&s;&s;a. Hi&s;tory, V. I. p.</HI> 28.</NOTE> have had an evil eye upon us, and not without cau&s;e (as them&s;elves appre|hend) and though we looke at this as the head of all for|rein enmity, yet the Lord hath &s;till &s;aved us, and that without any great impre&s;&s;ion of feare upon our &s;pirits. In the treaty about our confederacie, the doubtful con&s;truc|tion of it in England, the danger from a General Governor (e&s;pecially in regard of our brethren of Plimouth) the nece&s;&s;ity of our being involved in the quarrel with the Dutch, on the behalfe of our brethren of Hartford, were taken notice of by the generall court and many of the elders, &amp;c. yet neither would the court be deterred from entring into that brotherly league, nor were our elders or people troubled with feare of tho&s;e dangers. And now, lately, when we received Pumham and Sawconoco in to our juri&s;diction, the generall court con&s;idered how offen|&s;ive it would be to the Naragan&s;ets, and &s;o likely to ingage us in a warre with them; yet, the thing being lawful and expedient for us, and giving hope of opening a doore to the conver&s;ion of &s;ome of them, they would not let &s;lipp the opportunity of &s;uch advantages, for the feare of doubtful dangers. More I might add: All amounts to this &s;umme, the Lord hath brought us hither, through the &s;welling &s;eas, through perills of pyrates, tempe&s;ts, leakes, fires, rocks, &s;ands, di&s;ea&s;es, &s;tarvings, and hath here pre&s;erved us the&s;e many yeares from the di&s;plea&s;ure of Princes, the envy and rage of Prelates, the malignant plots of Je&s;uits, the mutinous contentions of di&s;contented per|&s;ons, the open and &s;ecret attempts of barbarous Indians, the &s;editious and undermineing practi&s;es of hereticall fal&s;e brethren; and is our confidence and courage all &s;wallowed up in the feare of one D'aulnay? Admit we &s;hould have &s;tepped a&s;ide out of our way, doth the favour and pro|tection of our God wholely depend upon our perfect walking? Were we never out of our way before, under all our former mercies and deliverances? Did Abraham,
<PB N="132" REF="011300_0069_0F86A01F78BCA498" MS="y">
I&s;aack, Jacob, David, Jeho&s;aphat, the people of I&s;rael, Judas, and others, never find protection and deliverance, when, by infirmity, they were found to be out of their way? If they did, why may not we &s;till &s;eeke and hope for the like, &s;eeing the Lords mercies indure for ever? For my part (if there were not other &s;ins, which God may have a controver&s;ie with us for) I &s;hould little feare any harme from this. If any breach were made in our peace, this is not the way to make it up. We may bring more di&s;plea&s;ure and danger upon our&s;elves, by the divi&s;ions and breaches of rule which may be occa&s;ioned by our un&s;ea|&s;onable &s;triveings about that which is now pa&s;t remedie, than would otherwi&s;e ari&s;e from any mi&s;carriage in the bu&s;ines it &s;elfe, in the wor&s;t con&s;truction that can be made thereof.</P>

<P>I Received, together with others, two letters from your &s;elfe, concerning the French affaire, and had I not hoped that you &s;hould have receaved a finall an&s;wer from us longe before this tyme, I &s;hould not have been &s;o longe &s;ilent, nor &s;hewed &s;oe much &s;eeming neglect, but being now almo&s;t out of hope of accompli&s;hing that which was intended, I thought meete to pre&s;ent you with the&s;e few lynes. Howe unplea&s;ing it was to mee for to expre&s;&s;e my &s;elfe by word or writeing contrary to the apprehen|&s;ion of your &s;elfe and other friends, both godly and wi&s;e, whome I both love and honour, hee that is the &s;earcher of hearts knoweth; and howe farr it was from my will

or intent, when I &s;ett my hand to that letter you receaved, to ca&s;t any di&s;honour upon your &s;elfe or others, I hope in tyme you &s;hall know and be fully per&s;uaded of. The truth is, our ayding of Latour was very grievous to many hereabouts, the de&s;igne being feared to be unwarrantable by dyvers, as the ca&s;e &s;tands with us; of which number I confe&s;&s;e I was, and &s;oe &s;till remaine one, and though the bu&s;ine&s;s was &s;oe farr proceeded in before wee writt the letter, as (for my parte) I had noe hope of &s;tayeing the &s;hippes, yet &s;ome of us thought it might be of good u&s;e to intimate that &s;ome cautions might be given to tho&s;e that went, and they be &s;trictly required to ob&s;erve the &s;ame, that &s;oe the undertaking myght be pre&s;erved from &s;inne and the common wealth from damage, &s;oe much as the ca&s;e was capable of, which cautions if refu&s;ed, then to &s;ig|nifie under our hands, our not con&s;enting to the proceed|ing, with our rea&s;ons thereof; but for any prote&s;tation again&s;t the act, condemning it, we never intended it, but frequently fully and expre&s;ly declined it, &s;oe the &s;ending the letter without tho&s;e cautions and after the &s;hippes were gone, concernes tho&s;e to an&s;wer that did it, for my parte I was much troubled att it &s;o &s;oone as I heard of it.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Deare&s;t Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Heard nothing further of Gloce&s;ter bu&s;ines till the 3d day of this week at even, when I received a letter from Mr. Blinman, together with a complaint of the towne again&s;t Griffens companie for &s;everal mi&s;demeanors. And at the foote of the complaint a referrence from your&s;elfe and 3 other magi&s;trates to me, for the redre&s;&s;e of them. I therefore di&s;patched away a me&s;&s;enger betimes the next morning, with a letter to Mr. Griffen, that he would &s;end me &s;uch of his men who&s;e names I had underwritten his letter, to an&s;wer to the mi&s;demeanors of &s;abbath-breaking, &s;wearing and drunkennes: And withall I &s;ent a letter with in&s;tructions to Mr. Blinman, with a warrant addre&s;&s;ed to the con&s;table. That if Mr. Griffen would not &s;end his men, that the con&s;table &s;hould attach their per&s;ons and bring them before mee: If they did re&s;i&s;t or refu&s;e, not to &s;trive with them nor to u&s;e any provoking termes, but to take witnes of their carriadge and to returne mee an an&s;wer; which here I have &s;ent you inclo&s;ed.

<P>THE mo&s;t con&s;iderable part of the Engli&s;h colonies profe&s;&s;e they came into the&s;e parts of the world with de&s;ire to advance the kingdome of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and to enjoy his precious ordinances with peace; and (to his prai&s;e they confe&s;&s;e) he hath not failed theire expectation hitherto, they have found &s;afety, warmth and refre&s;hing under his wings, to the &s;atisfaction of theire &s;oules. But they know and have con&s;idered that theire Lord and Ma&s;ter is King of righteou&s;nes and peace, that he gives an&s;werable lawes, and ca&s;ts his &s;ubjects into &s;uch a mould and frame, that (in theire weake mea&s;ure) they may hould forth his vertues in theire cour&s;e and carriage, not onely with the nations of Europe, but with the bar|barous natives of this wildernes. And accordingly, both in their treaties and conver&s;e, they have had an awfull re&s;pect to divine rules, endeavouring to walke uprightly and inoffen&s;ively, and in the midde&s;t of many injuries and in&s;olencies, to exerci&s;e much patience and long &s;uffrance towards them.</P>
<P>The Pequotts grew to an exce&s;&s;e of violence and out|rage, and proudly turned a&s;ide from all wayes of ju&s;tice and peace, before the &s;word was drawne or any ho&s;tile attempts made again&s;t them. During tho&s;e warres, and after the Pequotts were &s;ubdued, the Engli&s;h colonies were carefull to continue and e&s;tabli&s;h peace with the re&s;t of the Indians, both for the pre&s;ent and for po&s;terity, as by &s;everall treatyes with the Narrowgan&s;et and Mohiggin Sagamores may appeare. Which treaties, for a while,
<PB N="139" REF="011300_0072_0F86A021DE2168D0">
were in &s;ome good mea&s;ure duely ob&s;erved by all the In|dians; but, of late, the Narrowgan&s;ets, and e&s;pecially the Nyanticks theire confederats, have many wayes injuriou&s;ly broken and violated the &s;ame, by intertaineing and keeping among&s;t them, not onely many of the Pequot nation, but &s;uch of them as have had theire hands in the blood and murther of the Engli&s;h, &s;eizing and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing at lea&s;t a part of the Pequot country; which, by right of conque&s;t, appertaines to the Engli&s;h; by allowing or harbouring and withhoulding &s;everall Pequot captives fled from the En|gli&s;h, and making proud and in&s;olent returnes when they were redemanded. And, more lately, the Engli&s;h had manie &s;trong and concurrent Indian te&s;timonies from Long I&s;land, Uncoway, Hartford, Kinnibeck, and other parts, of Miantonimoes ambitious de&s;ignes, travelling through all the plantations of the neighbouring Indians, and, by promi&s;es and gifts, labouring to make him&s;elfe their uni|ver&s;al Sagamore or commander, per&s;uadeing and engage|ing them, at once, to cut off the whole bodie of the Engli&s;h in tho&s;e parts. Which treacherous plotts were confirmed by the Indians generall preparations in me&s;&s;ages, in&s;olencies and outrages again&s;t the Engli&s;h and &s;uch Indians as were &s;ubjects or friends to them; &s;o that the Engli&s;h colonies, to theire greate charge and damage, were forced to arme, to keep &s;trong watch, day and night, and &s;ome of them to travell with convoyes from one plantation to another, and when Miantonimo, in his circular travell, was que&s;tioned at Newhaven concerneing the&s;e things, in&s;tead of other and better &s;atisfaction, he threatned to cutt off any Indians head that &s;hould lay &s;uch a charge upon him to his face.</P>
<P>The commi&s;&s;ioners, by the premi&s;&s;es, ob&s;erved Mianto|nimoes proud and treacherous di&s;po&s;ition, yet thought not fitt to proceed again&s;t him in that re&s;pect, till they had collected more legall and convinceing proo&s;e.</P>
<P>But while the&s;e things were under deliberation, Mian|tonimo was brought pri&s;oner by Uncas to Hartford, and the ca&s;e being opened and cleared as followeth, he craved the commi&s;&s;ioners advi&s;e how to proceed with him.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="011300_0073_0F86A02274C6C1E8">It appeared that in a treatie made with the Engli&s;h, at the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Anno 1637, Miantonimo engaged him|&s;elfe not to fight with any of the Indians, and particularly not to invade Uncas without the Engli&s;h con&s;ent; and af|ter in a tripartite agreement made and concluded at Hart|ford betwixt Miantonimo and Uncas with reference to the Engli&s;h, Anno 1638, in which one of the articles runns, That though either of the &s;aid Indian Sagamores &s;hould receive injury from the other, yet neither of them &s;hall make or begin warre, untill they had appealed to the Engli&s;h, and till their grievances were fir&s;t heard and de|termined, and if either of them &s;hould refu&s;e, the Engli&s;h might a&s;&s;i&s;t again&s;t, and compell the refu&s;eing and ob&s;ti|nate partie.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding which, Miantonimo and his confede|rates have both forcibly and openly plotted and practi&s;ed again&s;t the life of Uncas not at all acquainting the Engli&s;h or advi&s;ing with them; but more e&s;pecially of late, &s;ince the forementioned plotts and de&s;ignes were in hand.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, a Pequott Indian, one of Uncas his &s;ubjects, in the &s;pring 1643, ayming at Uncas life, &s;hot him with an ar|row through the arme, and pre&s;ently fled to the Narrow|gan&s;etts or their confederates, boa&s;ting in the Indian plan|tations that he had killed Uncas. But when it was known that Uncas (though wounded) was alive, the Pequot (taught as was &s;uppo&s;ed) changed his note, affirming that Uncas had cut through his owne arme with a flint, and had hired him to &s;ay he had &s;hott and killed him.</P>
<P>Miantonimo, being &s;ent for by the governour of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts upon another occa&s;ion, brought this Pequott with him and would have covered him with the former di&s;gui&s;e, but when the Engli&s;h, out of his own mouth, found him guilty and would have &s;ent him to Uncas his Sagamore, Miantonimo earne&s;tly de&s;ired he might not be taken out of his hands, promi&s;ing he would &s;end him &s;afe to Uncas to be examined and puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>But feareing (as it &s;eems) his own treachery would be di&s;covered in a day or twoe, he &s;topped the Pequotts mouth by cutting off his heade; but at parting he tould
<PB N="141" REF="011300_0073_0F86A02274C6C1E8">
the governour in di&s;content that he would come no more to Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>After this &s;ome attempts were made (as is reported) to take away Uncas life by poy&s;on, and by forcery; the&s;e faileing, &s;ome of Sequa&s;&s;ons companie (an Indian Sagamore allyed unto and an intimate confederate with Miantonimo) &s;hott at Uncas, with an arrow or two, as he was goeing downe Connecticut river.</P>
<P>Uncas, according to the forementioned treatie (1638) complained, and the Engli&s;h, by mediation, &s;ought to make peace, but Sequa&s;&s;on expre&s;&s;ing his dependance on Mian|tonimo refu&s;ed, and cho&s;e warre. They fought and Uncas had the victory.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, Miantonimo, without any provocation from Uncas (unle&s;s the di&s;appointment of former plotts provoked) and &s;uddenly, without denouncing warre, came upon the Moheg|gins with 900 or 1000 men, when Uncas had not halfe &s;o many to defend him&s;elfe. Uncas, before the battle, tould Miantonimo that he had many wayes &s;ought his life, and for the &s;paring of bloud offered by a &s;ingle combate be|twixt them&s;elves to end the quarrell. But Miantonimo pre&s;uming upon his number of men, would have nothing but a battle. The i&s;&s;ue fell contrary to expectation, his men were routed, divers of con&s;iderable note &s;laine, and him&s;elfe taken pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>The&s;e things being duely weighed, the commi&s;&s;ioners judged that Uncas could not be &s;afe while Miantonimo lived: Wherefore, they thought he might ju&s;tly put &s;uch a treacherous and blood-thir&s;ty enemy to death; but ad|vi&s;ed him to doe it in his owne juri&s;diction, without torture or cruelty.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The be&s;t that can be &s;aid of this advice is, that it was politick. Miantonimo was a man of great &s;pirit. The Engli&s;h were in more fear of him than of any other Indian upon the continent.</NOTE></P>
<P>And Uncas, having hitherto &s;hewed him&s;elfe a friend to the Engli&s;h, and in this and former outrages (according to the treatie) craveing theire advi&s;e, if the Narrowgan&s;etts or their confederates &s;hould, for his ju&s;t execution, unju&s;tly a&s;&s;ault him, the commi&s;&s;ioners for the colonies promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t and protect him.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="011300_0074_0F86A025A44C09B8">Uncas hereupon &s;lew an ennemie, but not the enmity again&s;t him. The Narrowgan&s;etts &s;oon fell to new con|trivements. They pretended they had payd a ran&s;ome for theire Sachems life, and gave in particulars to the value of about fourty pounds. This, for a while, call an imputation of foule and unju&s;t dealing upon Uncas: But, in September 1644, the Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners, meeting at Hartford, &s;ent for the Narrowgan&s;ett Sachems, or theire deputies, de&s;ire|ing they might be in&s;tructed to make good theire charge.</P>
<P>Uncas came him&s;elfe; they &s;ent theire deputies. But after due examination it appeared, though &s;ome loo&s;e di&s;|cour&s;e had pa&s;&s;ed that, for &s;uch quantities of waompum and &s;uch parcells of other goods, to a greate value, there might have been &s;ome probability of &s;pareing his life, yet no &s;uch parcells were brought, and the Narrowgan&s;ett deputies did not alledge, much le&s;&s;e prove, that any ran&s;ome was agreed, nor &s;o much as any &s;erious treatie begun to re|deeme theire impri&s;oned Sachem; and as for the waom|pum and goods &s;ent, as they were but &s;mall parcells, and &s;carce con&s;iderable for &s;uch a purpo&s;e, &s;o they were di&s;|po&s;ed of by Miantonimo him&s;elfe, to &s;undry per&s;ons, for curte&s;ies received during his impri&s;onment, and upon hope of further favour.</P>
<P>The Narrowgan&s;ett deputies &s;aw theire proofes fell farre &s;hort of former pretences, and were &s;ilent. The commi&s;&s;ioners promi&s;ed that, upon better evidence here|after, they &s;hould have due &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Whereupon a truce was made, and both parties were in|gaged that all ho&s;tility &s;hould cea&s;e till planting time 1645, and after that they would give thirty dayes warning either at the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts or Hartford before the truce &s;hould cea&s;e. Yet in February la&s;t, the Narrowgan&s;etts by me&s;|&s;engers &s;ent to Bo&s;ton, declared that unle&s;s Uncas would render 160 fadom of waompum, or come to a new heare|ing within &s;ix weekes they would begin the warre.</P>
<P>This cro&s;&s;ed the former agreement, and the &s;ea&s;on was &s;uch that neither the commi&s;&s;ioners could be advi&s;ed with, nor could Uncas travel if notice had been given. After which about or before planting time Tantaquei&s;on a Mo|hegin

captaine who took Miantonimo pri&s;oner was dange|rou&s;ly and treacherou&s;ly wounded, at night, as he &s;lept in his wigwam, and other ho&s;tile arts were on both parts at|tempted in a private and underhand way, as they could take advantage one again&s;t the other.</P>
<P>But &s;ince the Narrowgan&s;etts have at &s;everal times open|ly invaded Uncas &s;o that Connecticut and New-Haven were forced, according to ingagement, to &s;end men from tho&s;e colonies for his pre&s;ent defence, but with expre&s;&s;e direction not to begin any offen&s;ive warre again&s;t the Nar|rowgan&s;etts or their confederates till further order.</P>

<P>The commi&s;&s;ioners being met &s;ent me&s;&s;engers, the &s;econd time, both to the Narrowgan&s;etts and Moheggin Indians, minding them of the former treatie and truce, de&s;iring them to &s;end their deputies in&s;tructed and furni&s;hed with autho|rity to declare and open the grounds of the warr, to give and receive due &s;atisfaction, and to re&s;tore and &s;ettle peace.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t, the Narrowgan&s;ett Sachem gave a rea&s;onable faire an&s;wer, that he would &s;end guides with them to the Moheggins, and if Uncas permitted he would &s;end his de|puties to the commi&s;&s;ioners, and, during eight dayes, ho&s;ti|lity &s;hould cea&s;e; but he &s;oone repented of his moderation, tould the Engli&s;h me&s;&s;engers his mind was changed, &s;ent private in&s;tructions to the Nyantick Sachem, after the de|livery of which there was nothing but proud and in&s;olent pa&s;&s;ages; the Indian guides which the Engli&s;h me&s;&s;engers brought with them from Pumham and Soconoco, were by frownes and threatning &s;peeches di&s;couraged, and re|turned; no other guides could be obtained, though much pre&s;&s;ed; they knew (as they expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves) by the cour&s;e held at Hartford the la&s;t yeare, that the commi&s;&s;io|ners
<PB N="144" REF="011300_0075_0F86A02639AD59B0">
would mediate and pre&s;&s;e for peace, but they were re&s;olved to have no peace without Uncas his head, it mattered not who began the warre, they were re&s;olved to continue it; the Engli&s;h &s;hould withdrawe theire gar|ri&s;on from Uncas, or they would take it as a breach of former covenants, and would procure as many Moquakes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Maquas or Mohawks.</NOTE> as the Engli&s;h &s;hould affront them with; that they would lay the Engli&s;h cattle on heapes as high as theire hou&s;es; that no Engli&s;h man &s;hould &s;tepp out of his hou&s;e to pi&s;&s;e, but he &s;hould be killed.</P>
<P>They reviled Uncas, charged him with cutting through his owne arme, and &s;aying the Narrowgan&s;etts had &s;hott him; affirmed, that he would now murder the Engli&s;h me&s;&s;engers, as they went or returned, (if he had opportu|nity) and lay it upon the Narrowgan&s;etts.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h me&s;&s;engers, upon this rude and uncivill u&s;age, wanting guides to proceed, and fearing danger, re|turned to the Narrowgan&s;etts, acquainted Pe&s;icus with the former pa&s;&s;ages, and de&s;ired guides from him, he (in &s;corne, as they apprehended it) offered them an ould Pequot &s;quawe, but would afford no other guides. There al&s;o they conceived them&s;elves to be in danger, three In|dians with hatchets &s;tanding behind the interpreter in a &s;u&s;picious manner, whil&s;t he was &s;peaking with Pe&s;icus, and the re&s;t frowneing and expre&s;&s;ing much di&s;temper in theire countenance and carriage. The Engli&s;h me&s;&s;en|gers, not hopeing for better &s;ucce&s;&s;e at that time, departed; telling Pe&s;icus, that if he would returne any other an&s;wer, he &s;hould &s;end it to the Engli&s;h tradeing hou&s;e, where they intended to lodge that night. In the morning, he invited them to returne, and promi&s;ed them a guide to Uncas, but would grant no ce&s;&s;ation of armes. When they came to Providence, they under&s;tood that, in their ab&s;ence, a Nar|rowgan&s;ett Indian had been there, and faineing him&s;elfe to be of Connecticot, &s;pake in that dialect, but could not put off the Narrowgan&s;ett tone. He tould Benedict Arnolds wife (who well under&s;tands the Indian language) that the Engli&s;h me&s;&s;engers &s;hould not pa&s;&s;e to the Moheggins;
<PB N="145" REF="011300_0075_0F86A02639AD59B0">
he knew they &s;hould have no guides, but &s;hould be de|&s;troyed in the woods, as they travelled towards Uncas.</P>
<P>Thus the Engli&s;h me&s;&s;engers returned, and the inter|preter, under his hand and upon his oath, related the former pa&s;&s;ages, with others le&s;&s;e materiall, more largely.</P>
<P>Mr. Williams, by the me&s;&s;engers, wrote to the com|mi&s;&s;ioners, a&s;&s;ureing them that the country would &s;uddenly be all on fire, meaneing by warre; that, by &s;trong rea&s;ons and arguments, he could convince any man thereof that was of another mind; that the Narrowgan&s;etts had been with the plantations combined with Providence and had &s;olemnly treated and &s;ettled a neutrality with them, which fully &s;hewes their councells and re&s;olutions for warre.</P>
<P>Thus while the commi&s;&s;ioners, in care of the public peace, &s;ought to quench the fire kindled among&s;t the Indians, the&s;e children of &s;trife breath out threatnings, provocations and warre again&s;t the Engli&s;h them&s;elves. So that unles they &s;hould di&s;honor and provoke God, by vio|lating a ju&s;t ingagement, and expo&s;e the colonies to con|tempt and danger from the Barbarians, they cannot but exerci&s;e force, when no other meanes will prevaile, to reduce the Narrowgan&s;etts and theire confederates to a more ju&s;t and &s;ober temper.</P>
<P>The eyes of other Indians, under the protection of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and not at all ingaged in this quarrell, are (as they have expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to the Engli&s;h me&s;&s;en|gers) fa&s;tned upon the Engli&s;h with &s;trict ob&s;ervation, in what manner and mea&s;ure they provide for Uncas &s;afety. If he peri&s;h, they will charge it upon them, who might have pre&s;erved him; and no Indians will tru&s;t the Engli&s;h, if they now breake ingagement, either in the pre&s;ent or &s;ucceeding generations. If Uncas be ruined in &s;uch a cau&s;e, they fore&s;ee theire heads, upon the next pretence, &s;hall be delivered to the will of the Narrowgan&s;etts, with whom therefore they &s;hall be forced to comply as they may, for theire future &s;afety, and the Engli&s;h may not tru&s;t an Indian in the whole country. The premi&s;&s;es being duely weighed, it clearely appeares that God calls the coloni&s;ts to a warre.</P>

<P>WHEREAS you Sergeant Major Edward Gibbones are appointed commander in chiefe of all &s;uch forces as are or &s;hall be &s;ent forth of the &s;everall colonies, as by your commi&s;&s;ion bearinge the date of the&s;e pre&s;ents doth more fully appeare, and whereas there is joyned to you by the &s;ame authority, as a councell of warre, divers of your chiefe officers, per&s;ons of approved worth and fidelity, as in the &s;aid commi&s;&s;ion they are more fully ex|pre&s;&s;ed: And whereas the cau&s;e and &s;cope of this expedi|tion is not onely to ayde the Moheggins, but to offend and invade the Narrowgan&s;etts, Nyanticks, and other theire confederates, who, upon making warre upon Uncas the Moheggin Sachem, contrary to theire ingagements, are become as well our enemies as his: Yet it being the ear|ne&s;t de&s;ire of the commi&s;&s;ioners, if it may be obtained with ju&s;tice, honour and &s;afety, to procure peace, rather than to pro&s;ecute warre; it is fir&s;t commended to your good di&s;cretions to take any fitt occa&s;ion, or (if with &s;afety you may without any con&s;iderable delay or danger to your proceedings) to u&s;e meanes to drawe on &s;uch a peace,
<PB N="150" REF="011300_0078_0F86A02ADF968858">
which you have hereby power to treate and conclude, wherein you are to take due con&s;ideration of the charges the colonies have expended in the warre, which you may e&s;timate by the numbers of men &s;ent forth at &s;everal times, by their continuance abroad, with wages and provi&s;ions appertaineing. And of the damage which Uncas hath &s;u&s;tained &s;ince the warre began, wherein it were meete (if it may be done with conveniency) he were con&s;ulted with, that both the colonies and he may receive ju&s;t &s;ati&s;|faction and repaire; which if the Narrowgan&s;etts cannot pre&s;ently make, a con&s;iderable part may be paid in hand, and the re&s;t by a yearely tribute; but withall, according to our ingagements, you are to provide for Uncas his fu|ture &s;afety, that his plantations be not invaded, that his men and &s;quawes may attend their planting, fi&s;hing and other occa&s;ions, without feare or injury; and that O&s;&s;wo|mekin, Pumham, Soconoco, Cutchamekin, and other Indians, friends or &s;ubjects to the Engli&s;h, be not mo|le&s;ted, which will di&s;turb the peace and draw on further charge and inconvenience. But a peace well framed will hardly be &s;ecured, unle&s;s either &s;ome of the chiefe Sa|chems deliver their &s;oones as ho&s;tages, or that &s;ome con&s;i|derable part of theire country be yeelded to the Engli&s;h for plantations, wherein there may be forts built by the Engli&s;h and maintained (at lea&s;t in part) by a tribute from the Narrowgan&s;etts, to &s;ecure the agreement. And it might probably conduce to the &s;ettling or pre&s;erving of peace, if a trade were &s;ettled betwixt the colonies and them; by which they might be &s;upplied with nece&s;&s;aries, but peeces and powder kept backe, which other traders furni&s;h them with. If you cannot conclude a peace with them, upon the termes above mentioned (to prevent greater inconvenience) you may abate &s;omewhat of our charges, and of the damage Uncas hath &s;u&s;tained: But much care mu&s;t be taken to &s;ecure both our and his future peace, which, if it may be done by rai&s;ing forts and keeping gar|ri&s;ons in the Narrowgan&s;ett and Nyantick countries, at theire charge, though we require ho&s;tages as above, they may be re&s;tored when the fortifications are fini&s;hed and

<OPENER><SALUTE>Honored Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOURS I long &s;ince received in an&s;wer of my reque&s;t in behalf of my friend Mr. Sherley and thanke you for your readines herein. Sir, I had written to you long &s;ince, but the truth is I could neither have content in &s;ilence or writing, by rea&s;on of &s;ome unworthy pa&s;&s;ages in our la&s;t generall court, to the great offence of our Gover|nor Mr. Prence, my&s;elfe, and &s;undry others. In the middle of October we had two courts &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, the fir&s;t being the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of our election court, the other our ordinary quarter court, and both generall courts. Before either of the&s;e two, at a court of a&s;&s;i&s;tants, other things giving opportunity, the Governor, Mr. Collier, Capt. Stan|di&s;h, and my&s;elfe being there, took into con&s;ideration a matter of great concernment, as we apprehended, and agreed mutually in the thing as nece&s;&s;ary to propound it to the generall court, which was the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of our election court: Accordingly it was propounded, and after a whole daies agitation it was allowed and entred in the wa&s;te booke, there being but one deputy again&s;t it, and he not direct; &s;ave onely, as he thought, it did not properly concerne that court. The next weeke, being in cour&s;e another of our generall courts, came more of our magi|&s;trates that live remote and were not with us either at the court of a&s;&s;i&s;tants or the foregoing generall court, where this act was done; And after a tumultuous manner except|ed again&s;t the entry of that order, as pernicious and de|&s;tructive to the weale of the government, with very many un&s;eemly termes concerning others, &amp;c. which exception of his was &s;trengthned by 3 other magi&s;trates, one where|of had joyned with us twice before and now again&s;t his own act, bat made beforehand by the fir&s;t excepter as well as the other two and many of the deputies: They cried
<PB N="154" REF="011300_0080_0F86A02C8B78F748">
out to have it defaced and cro&s;&s;ed. The Governor Mr. Prence, and my&s;elfe, would not allow it, or any other act, (Mr. Collier being ab&s;ent to our greefe) to be defaced; but if hereafter it &s;hould be found prejudiciall, it might be repealed by another act, but not otherwi&s;e. In briefe (for I am a&s;hamed to mention particulars, e&s;pecially to write them) a promi&s;e was made that it &s;hould re&s;t till the next generall court and nothing be done in it: And then, when court and country had duly thought of it, if they thought meet to repeale it they might. After this, the fir&s;t ex|cepter having been ob&s;erved to tender the view of a &s;croule from man to man, it came at length to be tendered to my &s;elfe, and withall, &s;aid he, it may be you will not like this. Having read it, I told him I utterly abhorred it as &s;uch as would make us odious to all chri&s;tian commonweales: But at length he told the Governor he had a written propo&s;i|tion to be propounded to the court, which he de&s;ired the court to take into con&s;ideration, and according to order, if thought meet, to be allowed: To this the deputies were mo&s;t made beforehand, and the other three a&s;&s;i&s;tants, who applauded it as their Diana; and the &s;um of it was, To allow and maintaine full and free tollerance of religion to all men that would pre&s;erve the civill peace and &s;ubmit unto government; and there was no limitation or excep|tion again&s;t Turke, Jew, Papi&s;t, Arian, Socinian, Nicho|laytan, Famili&s;t, or any other &amp;c. But our Governor and divers of us having expre&s;&s;ed the &s;ad con&s;equences would follow, e&s;pecially my&s;elfe and Mr. Prence, yet notwith|&s;tanding it was required, according to order, to be voted: But the Governor would not &s;uffer it to come to vote, as being that indeed would eate out the power of godlines, &amp;c.</P>
<P>By this you may &s;ee that all the troubles of N. E. are not at the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets. The Lord in mercy looke upon us, and allay this &s;pirit of divi&s;ion that is creeping in among&s;t us. You would have admired to have &s;een how &s;weet this carrion reli&s;hed to the pallate of mo&s;t of the deputies! What will be the i&s;&s;ue of the&s;e things our all-ordering God onely knows.

<P>I Cannot but out of that re&s;pect I owe your &s;elfe pre|&s;ente my re&s;pects to you in the&s;e few lines, and to give you to under&s;tand how things are here with us; we gott well to this i&s;land of Barbados through grace; here I found greate re&s;pect &s;ince my coming both from the go|vernment and people, only &s;orry I have been to heare told me by the governour off this place what our reve|rend Mr. Dudley &s;hould publickly &s;ay concerning him. The man &s;eems to me to be wi&s;e, moderate in his way and temperate, orthodox in his judgment, and I hope godly, his natural temper is affable and not violente; this take from me as from one that will declare the truth, he would nouri&s;h and honour religion according to his light, only here&s;ies (which this i&s;land abounds withall) he expo&s;eth.
<PB N="156" REF="011300_0081_0F86A02CF6B124F8">
A kind re&s;pective friend he hath beene to me, he &s;aith he de&s;ires corre&s;pondencie with you off New-England, and many able to come hither, as by my letters may appeare; I may be mi&s;taken, but love thinks noe ill and yet not blind.</P>
<P>I am here engaged to preach only for the pre&s;ent, the manner how I refer you to Mr. Wil&s;on, to whome I have wrote and Mr. Cotton.</P>
<P>The i&s;land &s;uites very well with my temper hitherto, through bountie, it is now and like to be very wealthy, full of &s;ugar, cotton, indigo, and ginger, &s;ome have made this yeare off one acre off canes about 4000 weight of &s;u|gar ordinarily 3000. Much drought now oppre&s;&s;eth, and I wonder, in the eye off argument, at Gods greate pa|tience to &s;o profaine a people for &s;wearing and drinking as the vulgar be. It mu&s;t certenly, in my apprehen&s;ion, be &s;ome &s;trong hand mu&s;t reforme them.</P>
<P>I would not be tedious to you. There hath this yeare beene brought over 3 commi&s;&s;ions, one from the Earle of Warwicke and commi&s;&s;ioners with him to command this government to profe&s;s them&s;elves for the parliament, and to lay a&s;ide their neutralitie. But this they &s;eem not to embrace, but have an&s;wered it thus, profe&s;&s;ing their wil|lingne&s;s to be &s;erviceable to the kingdome, their honour for the parliament, but their yet allegiance to the King, therefore de&s;ired to be &s;pared a little till things be &s;ettled.</P>
<P>There were one other for libertie of con&s;cience, that they have thus an&s;wered, that they are not unwilling not to pre&s;s any mans con&s;cience in matters of ceremonie, only in regard there are many &s;ects that under pretence off liber|tie may take occa&s;ion to denie all ordinances, and &s;o con|&s;equently the Lords day, therefore this they would require of all, to come to the publick preaching, and that &s;hall be &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>There is a 3d, and that is to call the Governor and &s;ome off the Councill into que&s;tion for &s;ome pretended acts off inju&s;tice here pa&s;t. And the&s;e things to be examined by inferiour per&s;ons here, and that not off the be&s;t in matter of opinion, and that &s;eems to exa&s;perate.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="011300_0081_0F86A02CF6B124F8">For &s;oe much, if I &s;hould be demanded how I thinke things will goe here, I would &s;ay, I am afrayde when I con|&s;ider off the profane&s;s off the place, and the divi&s;ions that are here and like to be, &s;oe much I certainly would &s;ay, had not a man greater arguments to carrie hither and here, for the pre&s;ent, to &s;tay him than temporalls, he would faile. How oft have I thought in my hearte, oh howe happie are New England people!</P>
<P>Not only thus, but even in re&s;pect off temporalls, for the common people, that have but meane e&s;tates, are very meane in re&s;pect of provi&s;ions, little fle&s;h if any, noe bread but ca&s;ader, a bread I approve not off; though its true the rich live high.</P>
<P>The country to my &s;en&s;e is not very hott, but that which I like well off; and a man with about 200 off pounds, in an ordinarie way off providence, might quickly gaine an e&s;tate by &s;ugar, which thrives wonderfully.</P>
<P>Capt. Middleton, ma&s;ter off the Parimour, is here like to &s;ettle, as he tells me, your younge&s;t &s;onne wente from New England with him into the Straits.</P>
<P>I cea&s;e to write any newes out off Old England, becau&s;e I heare Capt. Leverate came out with thee&s;e &s;hips here. Only we heare &s;ayd the King defended Scotland with 600 hor&s;e and were defeated and 2 or 300 cutt off. We heare he is come to the citie, but noe certaintie off that.</P>
<P>I have yet &s;ente for my wife to me, in the mid&s;t off theefe greate di&s;tractions, I &s;hall be glad to heare from your&s;elff. Sorry I am that I have not to expre&s;s my dear engagement to your per&s;on. Whether I &s;hall returne for New England I know not.

"Con&s;idering that the&s;e plantations had libertie to mould their civill order into that forme which they &s;hould finde to be be&s;t for them&s;elves, and that here the churches and commonwealth are complanted together in holy covenant and fellow&s;hip with God in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, he did at the reque&s;t of the general courte in the Baye drawe an ab&s;tract of the lawes of judgment delivered from God by Mo&s;es to the Commonwealth of I&s;rael, &s;o far forth as they are of moral, that is of perpetual and univer&s;al, equity among all nations, e&s;pecially &s;uch as the&s;e plantations are; where|in he advi&s;ed that Theocracie, i. e.

<P>A. 1.

This an&s;wer is grounded upon &s;undry pa&s;&s;ages in the &s;aid pattent, as p. 10. where it is &s;aid that the Gover|nor,
<PB N="180" REF="011300_0093_0F86A03B98AE2168">
Deputie Governor and A&s;&s;i&s;tants &s;hall apply them&s;elves to take care of the be&s;t di&s;po&s;eing and ordering of the ge|nerall affaires and bu&s;ine&s;&s;es of for and concerning the lands and premi&s;&s;es and the plantations thereof, and the government of the people there. Al&s;oe p. 11. it is &s;aid that the Governor, Deputie Governor and A&s;&s;i&s;tants, or anie number of them as is expre&s;&s;ed, &s;hall be a full and &s;uf|ficient courte for the handling, ordering and di&s;patching of all &s;uch bu&s;ine&s;&s;es and occurrences as &s;hall from time to time happen touching and concerning the &s;aid company or plantation. And it is &s;aid p. 12. that it is in the power of the generall courte to make laws and ordinances for the good and wellfare of the companie, and they may make and e&s;tabli&s;h whole&s;ome laws, &s;tatutes and ordinances for the &s;ettling of the forms and ceremonies of government and magi&s;tracie, and for managing and &s;ettling all &s;orts of officers, &s;uperiour and inferiour, and for the di&s;tingui&s;hing and &s;etting forth the &s;everall duties, powers and limmitts in every &s;uch office and place. 2dly. We doe not find that by the pattent they are expre&s;sly directed to proceed ac|cording to the word of God, but we under&s;tand that by a law or libertie of the country, they may act in ca&s;es wherein as yet there is no expre&s;&s;e law, &s;oe that in &s;uch acts they proceed according to the word of God.</P>
<P>Q. 2. Whether the Governor and A&s;&s;i&s;tants have anie power by pattent to di&s;pence ju&s;tice in the vacancie of the generall courte, without &s;ome law or order of the &s;ame to declare the rule?</P>
<P>A. We doe not find in this commonwealth now con&s;ti|tuted by this pattent that the Governor and A&s;&s;i&s;tants have any power to di&s;pence ju&s;tice in the vacancie of the gene|rall courte, without &s;ome law or order of the &s;ame, as the rule of theire admini&s;tration, which we conceive were meete to be expre&s;&s;ed for the regulateing of all particulars as far as may be, when &s;uch cannot be &s;upplyed by generall rules.</P>
<P>Q. 3. Whether anie generall courte hath not power in particular ca&s;es to choo&s;e any commi&s;&s;ioners, either a&s;&s;i&s;|tants or freemen, exempting all others, to give theire com|mi&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="181" REF="011300_0093_0F86A03B98AE2168">
to &s;ett forth theire power and places by any par|ticular ca&s;e, we meane in all things, and in tho&s;e of all the officers the commonwealth &s;tands in need of between elec|tion and election, not taking away the peoples liberties in election, nor turneing out any officer &s;oe elected by them without &s;hewing cau&s;e?</P>
<P>A. If the tearmes (all thinges) intend or imply all ca&s;es of con&s;tant judicature and coun&s;ell, we an&s;wer negatively, viz. that the generall courte hath not power by pattent in all ca&s;es to choo&s;e anie officers, as commi&s;&s;ioners, either a&s;&s;i&s;tants or freemen, exempting that is excluding all others, to give them commi&s;&s;ion, to &s;et forth theire power and places, becau&s;e it would then follow, that the magi&s;trates might be excluded from all ca&s;es of con&s;tant judicature and coun&s;ell which are theire principall worke, whereby al&s;oe the end of the peoples election would be made fru&s;trate. 2dly. But if the&s;e tearms (all things) imply and intend ca&s;es, whether occa&s;ionall or other, belonging neither to con&s;tant judicature nor coun&s;ell, we an&s;wer affirmatively, viz. The generall courte hath power by pattent in &s;uch particular ca&s;es to choo&s;e anie officers and commi&s;&s;ioners, either a&s;&s;i&s;tants or freemen, exempting all others, to give them commi&s;&s;ion, to &s;ett forth theire power and places, which yet we under&s;tand with this di&s;tinction, viz. that if the affaires committed to &s;uch officers or commi&s;&s;ioners be of generall concernment, we conceive the freemen accor|ding to the pattent are to choo&s;e them, the generall courte to &s;ett forth theire power and places; but if the affaires committed to &s;uch officers or commi&s;&s;ioners be meerely of particular concernment, then we conceive the generall courte may both choo&s;e them and &s;ett forth theire power and places. Whereas we give places of con&s;tant judicature and coun&s;ell to the magi&s;trates, we thus interpret the word (coun&s;ell) Coun&s;ell con&s;i&s;ts of care and action; in re&s;pect of care they are not to be limited, in re&s;pect of action they are to be limited by the generall courte as the &s;upreme coun&s;ell. Finally, it is our humble reque&s;t that if anie difference grow in the generall courte betweene

<P>Q. 2. Whether by pattent the generall courte, con&s;i&s;t|ing of magi&s;trates and deputies, as a generall courte, have judiciall and magi&s;traticall authoritie?</P>
<P>A. 1. The pattent in expre&s;&s;e words giveth full power and authoritie, as to the governor and a&s;&s;i&s;tants &s;oe to the freemen al&s;oe a&s;&s;embled in generall courte, p. 11. 2dly, Whereas there is a 3 fold power of magi&s;traticall authori|tie, legi&s;lative, judicative, and con&s;ultative or directative, of the publique affaires of the commonwealth, for provi|&s;ion and protection. The 1&s;t of the&s;e, namely, legi&s;lative, is expre&s;&s;ely given to the freemen joyntly with the gover|nor and a&s;&s;i&s;tants, p. 12. Con&s;ultative or directative power of the publique affaires of the commonwealth, for provi|&s;ion and protection, is al&s;o granted by the pattent unto the freemen as to the governor and a&s;&s;i&s;tants, p. 13. But now for the judicature, if we &s;peake of the con&s;tant and u&s;uall admini&s;tration hereof, we doe not find that it is granted to the freemen or deputies in the generall courte, either by the pattent or by the election of the people, or by anie law of the country. But if we &s;peake of the occational admini&s;tration thereof we find the power of judicature admini&s;trable by the freemen joyntly with the governor and a&s;&s;i&s;tants, upon a double occa&s;ion, 1. In ca&s;e of de|fect or delinquency of a magi&s;trate we find the whole generall courte of governor, deputy governor, a&s;&s;i&s;tants and freemen may proceed to remove him, p. 12. 2dly. If by the law of the countrey there lye anie appeale to the general courte or any other &s;pecial cau&s;es referred to theire judgement, it will nece&s;&s;arily inferre that in &s;uch ca&s;es, by &s;uch laws, the freemen joyntly with the governor

and a&s;&s;i&s;tants have power of judicature touching the ap|pealeants and cau&s;e, the appeale and tho&s;e re&s;erved ca&s;es. What we &s;peake of the power of freemen, the &s;ame may be &s;aid of deputies, &s;oe far forth as the power of the freemen is delegated to them by order of law.</P>
<P>Q. 3. Whether we may warrantably pre&s;cribe penalties to offences which may probably admitt of variable de|grees of guilt?</P>
<P>Q. 4. Whether a judge be bound to pronounce &s;en|tence as a po&s;itive law pre&s;cribes, in ca&s;e it be apparently above or beneath the merit of the offence?</P>
<P>A. 1. Certaine penalties may and ought to be pre&s;cribed to capitall crimes, although they may admitt variable de|grees of guilt, as in ca&s;e of murder upon prepen&s;ed malice and upon &s;udden provocation there is pre&s;cribed the &s;ame death in both, though murder upon a prepen&s;ed malice be a farre greater guilt than upon &s;udden provocation, <HI>Num.</HI> 35, 16, 17, 18. with ver. 20 21. al&s;oe in crimes of le&s;&s;e guilt, as in theift, though &s;ome theift be of greater guilt than other (as for &s;ome men to &s;teale a &s;heepe that hath le&s;&s;e nede is of greater guilt than for another who hath more nede) the Lord pre&s;cribed one &s;ame mea&s;ure of re&s;ti|tution to both, <HI>Exod.</HI> 22.1. 2dly, In ca&s;e variable circum&s;tances of an offence doe &s;oe much varie the degrees of guilt, as that the offence is rai&s;ed to a higher nature, then the penaltie mu&s;t be varied to an higher an&s;werable proportion; the &s;trikeing of a neighbour may be puni&s;hed with &s;ome pecuniary mulct, when the &s;trikeing of a father may be puni&s;hed with death; &s;oe any &s;in committed with an hie hand, as the gathering &s;ticks of the Sabbath day may be puni&s;hed with death, when a le&s;&s;er puni&s;hment might &s;erve for gathering &s;ticks privily and in &s;ome need. 3dly, In ca&s;e circum&s;tances doe &s;oe varie a &s;inne as that many &s;innes are complicated and wrapped up in it, the pe|naltie is to be varied according to the penaltie of tho&s;e &s;everall &s;innes. A &s;ingle lye may be puni&s;hed with a le&s;&s;e mulct than if it be tould before the judgement &s;eate, or

el&s;ewhere to the damage of any per&s;on, whether in his good name by &s;lander, or in his e&s;tate by detriment in his commerce, in which ca&s;e a lye aggravated by circum&s;tances is to be puni&s;hed with re&s;pect both to a lye and a &s;lander, and to the detriment which another &s;u&s;taineth thereby. 4thly, In ca&s;e that the circum&s;tances, which varie the degrees of guilt, concerne only the per&s;on of the offender (as whether it were his fir&s;t offence, or cu&s;tomarie, whether he was inticed thereto or the inticer, whether he was prin|cipall or acce&s;&s;ary, whether unadvi&s;ed or wittingly and wil|lingly, &amp;c.) there it were meete that the penaltie &s;hould be expre&s;&s;ed with a latitude, whereof the lowe&s;t degree to be expre&s;&s;ed, &s;uppo&s;e 5<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> or as the ca&s;e may be 5 &s;tripes, and the highe&s;t degree 20<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> or 40<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> or &s;tripes more or le&s;s, within which compa&s;s or latitude it may be free to a magi|&s;trate to aggravate or mitigate the penaltie as the circum|&s;tances doe require or alleviate the offence. Yet we would have care be taken that a magi&s;trate attend in his &s;entence to a certaine rule, as much as may be in tho&s;e cir|cum&s;tances, le&s;t &s;ome per&s;on who&s;e &s;ins be alike circum|&s;tantiated with another, if his puni&s;hment be not equall the one with the other, one may thinke him&s;elfe more unequally dealt withall than another. 5thly, In tho&s;e ca&s;es wherein a judge is per&s;waded in con&s;cience that a crime de&s;erved a greater puni&s;hment than the law inflict|eth, he may lawfully pronounce &s;entence according to the pre&s;cript penaltie of the law, becau&s;e he hath noe power committed to him by law to goe higher; but where the law may &s;eem to the con&s;cience of the judge to inflict a greater penalty than the offence de&s;erveth, it is his part to &s;u&s;pend his &s;entence till by conferrence with the law|givers he hath liberty, either to inflict the &s;entence or to mitigate it. 6thly, The penalties of great crimes may be &s;ometimes mittigated by &s;uch as are in cheife power, which in this country is the generall courte, out of re&s;pect to the publique good &s;ervices which the delinquent hath done to the &s;tate in former times; &s;o Solomon mittigated the pu|ni&s;hment

<P>Q. 1. Whether the di&s;tinction of power and authoritye in magi&s;trates, and only libertie of coun&s;ell in the people, be according to the pattent, with re&s;pect of the magi&s;trates and deputies in the generall court?</P>

<P>A.

<P>Q. 3. Whether our government be a pure ari&s;tocracie or mixt with a democracie? If mixt, whether it &s;hould not be mixt in all the admini&s;trations of the &s;ame?</P>
<P>A. 1. Our government is not a meere ari&s;tocracy, but mixt of an ari&s;tocracy and democracy, in re&s;pect of the generall courte. 2dly, Notwith&s;tanding it be mixed in the generall courte, yet it followeth not nece&s;&s;ary thereupon,

The Remon&s;trance and humble Petition of us who&s;e names are underwritten, in behalfe of our&s;elves and divers others within this juri&s;diction, humbly &s;heweth,</OPENER>
<P>THAT we cannot but with all thankfulnes acknow|ledge your indefatigable paines, continuall care and con&s;tant vigilancy, which, by the ble&s;&s;ing of the Almighty, hath procured unto this wilderne&s;s the much de&s;ired fruits of peace and plenty: While our native land, yea the chri&s;tian world, is &s;harply afflicted with the devour|ing &s;word and the &s;ad con&s;equents of inte&s;tine wars. And further, that you whom the Lord hath placed at the helme of the&s;e plantations and endowed with eminent gifts fitt for &s;uch honourable callings, are be&s;t able to fore&s;ee the clouds which hang over our heads, the &s;torms and tem|pe&s;ts which threaten this poor handfull here planted, and timou&s;ly to amend them.

<P N="1">1. Whereas this place hath been planted by the incou|ragement, next under God, of letteris patents given and granted by his Maje&s;ty of England to the inhabitants there|of, with many privileges and immunities, viz. Incorpora|tion into a company, liberty of choo&s;ing governors, &s;etling government, making lawes not repugnant to the lawes of England, power of admini&s;tring the oath of allegiance to

Notwith&s;tanding, we cannot, according to our judg|ments, di&s;cerne a &s;etled forme of government according to the lawes of England, which may &s;eeme &s;trange to our countrymen, yea to the whole world, e&s;pecially con&s;ider|ing we are all Engli&s;h. Neither do we &s;o under&s;tand and perceyve our owne lawes or libertyes, or any body of lawes here &s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed, as that thereby there may be a &s;ure and comfortable enjoyment of our lives, libertyes, and e&s;tates, according to our due and naturall rights, as free|borne &s;ubjects of the Engli&s;h nation. By which, many in|conveniences flow into plantations, viz. jealou&s;ies of intro|ducing arbitrary government, which many are prone to beleeve, con&s;truing the procra&s;tination of &s;uch &s;etled lawes to proceed from an overgreedy &s;pirit of arbitrary power (which it may be is their weaknes) &s;uch proceedings be|ing dete&s;table to our Engli&s;h nation, and to all good men, and at pre&s;ent a chief cau&s;e of the inte&s;tine warre in our deare country: Further, it gives cau&s;e to many to thinke them&s;elves hardly dealt with, others too much favored, and the &s;cale of ju&s;tice too much bowed and unequally bal|lanced: From whence al&s;o proceedeth feares and jealou&s;ies of illegall committments, unju&s;t impri&s;onments, taxes, rates, cu&s;tomes, levyes of ungrounded and undoing a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments, unju&s;tifiable pre&s;&s;es, undue fynes, unmea&s;urable expences and charges, of unconceyvable dangers through a negative or de&s;tructive vote unduly placed, and not well regulated, in a word, of a non certainty of all things we enjoy, whe|ther lives, liberties or e&s;tates; and al&s;o of undue oaths, being &s;ubject to expo&s;ition, according to the will of him or them that gives them, and not according to a due and un|bowed rule of law, which is the true interpreter of all oathes to all men, whether judge or judged.</P>
<P>Wherefore our humble de&s;ire and reque&s;t is, that you would be plea&s;ed to con&s;ider of our pre&s;ent condition and upon what foundation we &s;tand, and unanimou&s;ly concurr to e&s;tabli&s;h the fundamentall and whole&s;ome lawes of our native country, and &s;uch others as are no wayes repugnant

<HEAD>A Declaration of the General Court holden at Bo&s;ton 4 (9) 1646. concerning a Remon&s;trance and Petition exhibited at la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion of this Court by Doctor Child, Thomas Fowle, Samuel Maverick, Thomas Burton, John Smith, David Yale, and John Dand.</HEAD>
<P>IN this Petition and Remon&s;trance (as they call it) which is the fir&s;t of the &s;orte that we have received, and (as we conceive) without pre&s;ident in any plantation or e&s;tabli&s;hed commonwealth, as will appear by the &s;male cau&s;e of &s;uch remon&s;trance, and as little rea&s;on for what is petitioned. We fir&s;t ob&s;erve the &s;olemne and religious profe&s;&s;ion they make of the &s;incerity and &s;inglene&s;s of their end in re&s;pect of the glory of God and the good of this colonie, which we have rea&s;on to be jealous of with a godly jealou&s;ie, when we con&s;ider what connexion and affi|nity there is betweene &s;uch greate and glorious ends and the pur&s;uit they make in their remon&s;trance, &s;o far from truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s, together with the means they have propounded for attaining the fame. We therefore wi&s;h them well and deeply to con&s;ider that they have herein to doe with him by whom actions are weighed, who&s;e eyes
<PB N="197" REF="011300_0101_0F86A0438037F438">
are like a flame of fire, who will make all the churches knowe that he &s;earcheth the heart and the reines, and will render to every one of them according to theire workes. It were a dreadful dareing pre&s;umption, if the ble&s;&s;ed name of the mo&s;t high God (who&s;e honor is &s;o oft avouch|ed to be theire ayme in this de&s;igne) &s;hould be made to &s;erve a corrupt project. The next thing we ob&s;erve is, a divine over-ruling hand leadinge them to a cleare acknow|ledgment of that truth which cutts the &s;inewes of theire remon&s;trance, and ju&s;tifies our government and all the ad|mini&s;trations thereof, again&s;t all that reproach and blame they endeavour after to ca&s;t upon it. The words are the&s;e, We cannot but with all thankfulnes acknowledge your in|defatigable paines, continuall care and con&s;tant vigilance, which (by the ble&s;&s;ing of the Almighty) hath procured unto this wildernes the mo&s;t de&s;ired fruites of peace and plenty; whil&s;t our native land (yea the chri&s;tian world) is &s;harpely afflicted, &amp;c. From which words we inferre the&s;e 4 propo&s;itions. 1. The government e&s;tabli&s;hed in this colonie (by the ble&s;&s;ing of the Lord) hath beene di&s;penced and admini&s;tred, from the fir&s;t to la&s;t, with a &s;peciall and eminent mea&s;ure of care and watchfullnes upon all occa&s;ions. 2dly, By the ble&s;&s;ing of the Lord, the government e&s;ta|bli&s;hed and admini&s;tred as afore&s;aid, hath beene a procuring cau&s;e of peace and plentie to this colonie. 3dly, By the ble&s;&s;ing of the Lord, the government e&s;tabli&s;hed as afore|&s;aid, and the good effects thereof have beene graunted to us in this wildernes, and that at &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on, while not only our native country, but the chri&s;tian world, are &s;harp|ly vi&s;ited and afflicted with contrary evills (we may &s;ay in this ca&s;e with a&s;toni&s;hment, Not unto us, Lord, but to thy name be the prai&s;e, we confe&s;&s;e it is our &s;hame (we de&s;ire it may be al&s;o our &s;orrow) that we have not rendered to the Lord according to his great goodnes.) 4thly, The Petitioners (by theire owne confe&s;&s;ion) have not only no cau&s;e to blame this government, or the admini&s;tration or effects thereof, but are bound with all thankfulnes to ac|knowledge the good fruites thereof, as wherein them|&s;elves have had theire &s;hare.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="011300_0102_0F86A044353E0528">The&s;e foure propo&s;itions (allowing to the fir&s;t of them that which humane frailty calls for) are (as we conceive) no le&s;&s;e evident in the truth of them than in theire depen|dance upon the petitioners owne words. Yet we ob&s;erve 3dly, How they &s;ometimes &s;ende forth &s;weete water and bitter. For in the following pa&s;&s;ages they &s;peake of leakes, which (they &s;ay) will inevitablie &s;inke this weake and ill-compacted ve&s;&s;ell, which they wholly impute to the evills of our government, civill and eccle&s;ia&s;ticall, both in the ad|mini&s;tration and effects thereof. And though in the &s;aid propo&s;itions, they make us monuments of mercie, prefer|ring us above our native country, yea above the chri&s;tian world; yet, in the conclu&s;ion they affirme the quite con|trary; houlding us forth as the &s;cumme and off-&s;couring, &s;uch as our brethren in England, in their ju&s;t indignation, avoyde as a pe&s;t, which they wholely a&s;cribe to the evills of our government. They highly commend the admini|&s;tration of this government, and yet complaine of an arbi|trary power, dete&s;table (as they &s;ay) to our Engli&s;h nation and to all good men. They commend this government in re&s;pect of care and watchfulnes; and yet they &s;peake of many &s;heepe in this wildernes without &s;hepheard, in a forlorne condition. They largely acknowledge the good effects of this government; and yet cry out of intollerable &s;lavery and bondage. They commend it in re&s;pect of peace and plenty; and yet they &s;peake of di&s;contents fretting like cancers, of merchants wa&s;teing, of hu&s;bandry wither|ing, of villages and plantations much de&s;olated, and that all bu&s;ines both in church and commonwealth have &s;eemed to go backward, and that for many year. They commend it in re&s;pect of peace; and yet affirme they have no &s;ecu|rity of theire lives and liberties, but are under a non cer|tainty of all they enjoy. They commend it in re&s;pect of peace; and yet &s;peake of contentions, readie to breake out into a fearful flame, blameing the government as the cau&s;e thereof. They commend it in re&s;pect of plenty; yet pro|&s;e&s;&s;e they are brought to the brinke of extreame poverty, &s;o as they beg of the parliament &s;ome help for tran&s;porta|tion
<PB N="199" REF="011300_0102_0F86A044353E0528">
to &s;ome other place. They profe&s;&s;e they owe ac|knowledgment with all thankfulnes for what they here enjoy; and yet affirme that by rea&s;on of unju&s;tifiable, un|grounded and undue taxes impo&s;ed on them, they are in wor&s;e condition than the natives them&s;elves. They pro|fe&s;&s;e &s;uch acknowledgment as afore&s;aid; and yet affirme that they are in &s;uch a place, where they cannot live like chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>The&s;e petitioners fabricke being thus overthrowne by theire owne confe&s;&s;ion and manife&s;t contradictions, we might have throwne out theire petition, as not worthie our further trouble, but le&s;t they &s;hould pretend, that theire &s;aid thankfull acknowledgment was but a complement, or a piece of theire rhetorick <HI>(ad acquirendam gratiam)</HI> to gaine favour (yet let them con&s;ider what we put them in mind of at fir&s;t, how dangerous it is to engage the greate name of the Almighty, to advance theire corrupt and un|charitable de&s;ignes. <HI>(Nec tutum e&s;t ludere cum &s;acris)</HI> It is not &s;afe to dally with things &s;acred. We will there|fore, for the petitioners more cleare conviction, and further &s;atisfaction to all the world, examine their particular grie|vances, and other pa&s;&s;ages which we meete with in theire remon&s;trance, &amp;c. and give &s;uch account of our government and admini&s;trations both civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical, as none &s;hall be able (we hope) to contradict the truth thereof.</P>
<P>For our government it&s;elfe, it is framed according to our charter, and the fundamental and common lawes of England, and carried on according to the &s;ame (takeing the words of eternal truth and righteou&s;nes along with them, as that rule by which all kingdomes and juri&s;dictions mu&s;t render account of every act and admini&s;tration, in the la&s;t day) with as bare allowance for the di&s;proportion between &s;uch an ancient, populous, wealthy kingdome, and &s;o poore an infant thinne colonie, as common rea&s;on can afford. And becau&s;e this will better appeare by compareing par|ticulars, we &s;hall drawe them into a parallel. In the one columne we will &s;ett downe the fundamental and common lawes and cu&s;tomes of England, beginning with Magna

Charta, and &s;o goe on to &s;uch others as we had occa&s;ion to make u&s;e of, or may at pre&s;ent &s;uite with our &s;mall be|ginnings: In the other columne we will &s;ett downe the &s;umme of &s;uch lawes and cu&s;tomes as are in force and u&s;e in this juri&s;diction, &s;hewing withall (where occa&s;ion &s;erves) how they are warranted by our charter. As for tho&s;e po&s;itive lawes or &s;tatutes of England, which have been from tyme to tyme e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the ba&s;is of the com|mon law, as they have been ordained upon occa&s;ions, &s;o they have been alterable &s;till upon like occa&s;ion, without hazarding or weakening the foundation, as the experience of many hundred yeares hath given proofe of. Therefore
<PB N="201" REF="011300_0103_0F86A04537AA80E8">
there is no nece&s;&s;itie that our owne po&s;itive lawes (which are not fundamental) &s;hould be framed after the patterne of tho&s;e of England, for there may be &s;uch different re|&s;pects, as in one place may require alteration, and in the other not.</P>
<P>For our&s;elves, we mu&s;t profe&s;&s;e our in&s;ufficiencie for &s;o greate matters (as the remon&s;trants al&s;o judge of us) and that in the lawes of England we have but the knowledge of novices, which is mixed with ignorance, and therefore &s;uch faileings as may appeare either in our collection of tho&s;e lawes, or in conforming our owne to that patterne, are to be imputed to our want of &s;kill. If we had able lawyers among&s;t us, we might have beene more exact.</P>

<P><PB N="208" REF="011300_0107_0F86A04A643D9E50">By this it may appeare that our politic and fundamen|talls are framed according to the lawes of England, and according to the charter; &s;o that the petitioners (if they had not ca&s;t off all mode&s;ty) mu&s;t needs be a&s;hamed of this complaint, as al&s;o of tho&s;e which follow, viz. Arbitrarie government, The negative vote, Illimited oathes, Unju&s;t taxes, Illegall committments, &amp;c. For the fir&s;t, we u&s;e to &s;ay, Rome was not built in a day: Nay, they could write of it many hundred yeares after, <HI>Tantae molis erat,</HI> &amp;c. Let them produce any colonie or commonwealth in the world, where more hath beene done in 16 yeares. Let them &s;hew where hath beene more care and &s;trife to pre|vent all arbitrarines, and to bring all judgements to a cer|taine rule, &s;o farre as may be. Let them confe&s;&s;e theire ignorance of the judiciall proceedings in England, or theire malice which &s;etts them on, to take up any thing to throw at us, though it cutt theire owne fingers, as the practi&s;e of England (which they would &s;eeme &s;o much to adhere unto) will mo&s;t certainely doe, if they looke into any of tho&s;e courts of judicature (except it be the common pleas) but e&s;pecially the chauncery (which is the highe&s;t court of judicature) the court of reque&s;ts, the chauncery of the exchequer and of the dutchie, in which courts they are not tyed to the common lawes or &s;tatutes of England, but doe judge arbitrarily <HI>(&s;ecundum aequum et bonum)</HI> accord|ing to equitie. If they can give no rea&s;onable an&s;wer here (as we are &s;ure they cannot) they mu&s;t either harden theire hearts or confe&s;&s;e theire guilt, and be as carefull to reforme theire arbitrary obedience, as we are to keepe off arbitrary government. We may &s;ay the &s;ame for the &s;econd, the Negative vote. Sure the&s;e men would &s;eeme to have mi&s;teries of &s;tate in theire heads, and they meane to keepe them there. They tell us of a de&s;tructive negative vote, but they neither &s;hew where nor what this daunger is, nor what remedie for it. It may be they have found out a way how a mixt government may &s;ub&s;i&s;t with|out a negative vote, which this court (with all the help of all the elders, and other the wi&s;e&s;t in the country, after
<PB N="209" REF="011300_0107_0F86A04A643D9E50">
two or three years endeavour) could not attaine; nor would the farre deeper wi&s;dome of the parliament of England ever attempt it (and that the&s;e remon&s;trants are not igno|rant of) nor doe they affect a democracie. Therefore this mu&s;t needs be put in only as a fine device <HI>(ad facien|dum populum)</HI> to plea&s;e the people. For the third, viz. Illimitted oathes, and covenants not explained by lawe: They &s;hould have done well to have tould us what oathes and covenants they meane, for <HI>(dolus ver&s;atur in univer&s;a|libus)</HI> deceit lyes hid in generalls. We know no oathes we impo&s;e upon any, other than &s;uch as are allowed by our charter, and were in practi&s;e by the company in London (as occa&s;ion required) before we came into the&s;e parts. And for covenants of a civill nature, there hath not beene &s;o much as any mention of any &s;uch among&s;t us the&s;e many yeares, &s;ave only, the la&s;t yeare, a motion was made in court of complying with our native country in the na|tionall covenant there, which was referred to further con|&s;ideration. As for our church covenant, that &s;hall be &s;poken to in its proper place. Be&s;ides (to prevent all &s;uch burdens) we have e&s;tabli&s;hed a lawe to that end, as appears here before. 5thly, For unju&s;t taxes, there is none that come among&s;t, us or heare of our condition and affaires, but will marvaile for what purpo&s;e &s;uch great &s;ummes &s;hould be rai&s;ed upon the country, as &s;hould occa&s;ion this grievance; &s;eeing we attempt nothing of chardge, but what is nece&s;&s;arie, and what the freemen and members of the court contribute unto, as largely as any other. We &s;pend nothing &s;uperfluou&s;ly in buildings, fea&s;tings, pen|&s;ions, public gratuities, officers fees, or the like; nay we are a&s;hamed &s;ometimes at our penuriou&s;nes, but that we had rather beare &s;hame and blame, than overburden the people. Such as are in chiefe office among&s;t us are con|tent to live beneath the honour of their places that they might ea&s;e the common charge. All our publick expences have beene about &s;ome &s;mall fortifications, makeing lawes, di&s;pen&s;eing ju&s;tice, &s;ome expeditions again&s;t the Indians, who by their injuries and in&s;olencies have provoked us
<PB N="210" REF="011300_0108_0F86A04AF58120D8">
thereunto, and &s;ome forraigne occa&s;ions of late, which accidentally fell upon us. If the remon&s;trants have knowne of any lavi&s;h wa&s;ting or mi&s;pence of the publick trea&s;ure, it had beene fitt they &s;hould have mentioned it, otherwi&s;e they deale unju&s;tly and injuriou&s;ly with us, to expect we &s;hould provide for theire peace and &s;afety, and yet deny us the meanes whereby we &s;hould accompli&s;h it. 6thly, For illegall committments, theire complaint pre|tends frequencie, otherwi&s;e it were not a publick grie|vance, therefore we conceive they might have produced &s;ome cleare in&s;tances in this kind. But let them bring forth one: Or let them charge any of the courts or magi|&s;trates with corruption in theire places, or manife&s;t inju&s;tice in theire &s;entences: Or the government with allowance of any thing that is morally evill. If not; they are impu|dent &s;landerers, and deeply guilty of the breach of the 5th commandment which (without &s;erious repentance) God will require of them. 7thly, The&s;e remon&s;trants would be thought to be a repre&s;entative part of all the non-free|men in the countrie; but when we have pulled off theire vizards, we find them no other but Robert Child, Thomas Fowle, &amp;c. For fir&s;t, although their petition was re|ceived with all gentlenes, yet we heare of no other part|ners that have appeared in it, though it be four months &s;ince it was pre&s;ented. Againe, we know that divers of the non-freemen have lived &s;ome in Virginia and other plantations, where the government hath not been &s;o ea&s;y to them as they have found it here. Others have lived in Kent, under the lawes of Gavelkind, more repugnant to the common lawes of England than any of ours. Others have had to doe in maritime affaires; others in cau&s;es te&s;|tamentrie and matrimoniall; others in the chancery, and others in London and other corporations, and &s;o have found by experience that Engli&s;hmen may live comforta|bly and &s;ecurely under &s;ome other lawes be&s;ides the com|mon and &s;tatute lawes of England; and that all the privi|ledge of a freeborne Engli&s;h &s;ubject is his intere&s;t in the lawes, without right of election of publick officers, which
<PB N="211" REF="011300_0108_0F86A04AF58120D8">
they were never acquainted with there, and yet payd their equall proportions to all publick charges, &amp;c. The&s;e non-freemen al&s;o are well &s;atisfyed (as we conceive) and doe ble&s;&s;e God for the ble&s;&s;ings and priviledges they doe enjoy under this government. They think it is well, that ju&s;tice is equally admini&s;tred to them with the free|men; that they have equall &s;hare with them in all towne lotts, commons, &amp;c. that they have like libertie of acce&s;&s;e to the church a&s;&s;emblies, and like place and re&s;pect there, according to theire qualities, as al&s;o in all neighbourly meetings for maintenance of love, as al&s;o like freedome of trade and commerce. So that we have good cau&s;e to be per&s;waded, that there are not many of the&s;e di&s;contented remon&s;trants within our juri&s;diction, nor in New England. We are further confirmed herein, when we con&s;ider what hard &s;hifts the&s;e remon&s;trants were put unto, to make up the number of &s;even. The fir&s;t (and he that mu&s;t <HI>(ducem agere in hujus militiae)</HI> be the leader in this de&s;igne) is a Paduan Doctor (as he is reputed) lately come into the country, who hath not &s;o much as ta&s;ted of their grievances, nor like to doe, being a batchelour and only a &s;ojournour, who never payd penny to any publick charge, though (of his owne good-will) he hath done &s;omething for publick u&s;e. A &s;econd, is a church member, but will be no free|man; he likes better to be ca&s;ed of that trouble and charge. A third, is a freeman, but no member of any church, and the rea&s;on hath beene his profe&s;&s;ed affection to the hierar|chie. A fourth, is a clarke of the prothonotaries office, a &s;ojournour al&s;o, and of no vi&s;ible e&s;tate in the country, one who hath never appeared formerly in &s;uch de&s;igne, how|ever he hath been drawne into this; it is like to be as tho&s;e who were called by Ab&s;olom to accompany him to Hebron. A fifth, is a young merchant, little acquainted with com|monwealth affaires. We are willing to &s;uppo&s;e he might al&s;o be one of them, who were invited by Ab&s;olom to He|bron, but &s;ure we are, it is no &s;mall griefe to his honoured godly friends to find him there, when they prayed and waited dayly to heare of him in Jeru&s;alem. A &s;ixth was
<PB N="212" REF="011300_0109_0F86A04BE292F3C0">
taken up by accident, being none of this juri&s;diction, but him&s;elfe and familie inhabiting at Rhode-I&s;land. The &s;eventh, is an ould grocer of London, who&s;e forgetfulnes of the lawes and cu&s;tomes of that citty, and unmindfull|nes of his dutie to the government under which he now lives and pro&s;pers, we may impute to his age and &s;ome other infirmities. And the&s;e are the champions who mu&s;t repre&s;ent the bodie of non-freemen. If this be their head, &s;ure they have <HI>(in&s;ul&s;um caput et non multo &s;ale defaecandum)</HI> an un&s;avoury head, not to be &s;ea&s;oned with much &s;alt. It may be thought rather that this was &s;ome dareing bu&s;ines at &s;ome of their merry-meetings, like that of Sir Roger Williams and the Dutch commander Skencke, who in a vyeing bravery would adventure to fetch the prince of Parma out of his tent in the midde&s;t of his army.</P>
<P>Thus have we traced our remon&s;trants through the civill &s;tate, wherein it was ea&s;ie to follow them by theire ill &s;cent; they are now pa&s;&s;ing over to the church, but in theire way they will needs ob&s;erve &s;ome notable decay of trade and hu&s;bandry, &amp;c. and withall &s;ome malignant and noi&s;ome di&s;ea&s;es among us, and they are bould to deliver Gods councell therein without con&s;ulting with his ora|cles, where they might have learned that all things come alike to all, and as many as I love I rebuke and cha&s;ti&s;e, and judgment mu&s;t begin at the hou&s;e of God (and how then mu&s;t malignants &s;peed) So as theire imputeing &s;uch afflictions to the evil of our government is without rule, nor doe they deale faithfully in their di&s;covery. For although our merchants have &s;u&s;tained &s;ome late lo&s;&s;es at &s;ea in two or three voyages, yet we have no cau&s;e to mur|mure at the good providence of the Lord, who hath well repaired tho&s;e lo&s;&s;es by his ble&s;&s;ing upon us in our fi&s;hing and other tradeing abroade, and by the &s;ucce&s;&s;e he hath given to our labours at home, &s;o as we could &s;pare twenty thou&s;and bu&s;hells of corne the la&s;t yeare (&s;o much at lea&s;t being tran&s;ported) and a good quantity &s;hipped out al|ready this pre&s;ent yeare. As for tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es they &s;peak of, it is true (and the Lord teach us to profitt thereby)
<PB N="213" REF="011300_0109_0F86A04BE292F3C0">
God was plea&s;ed to vi&s;it &s;ome of our townes the la&s;t &s;pring with a more violent fever than ordinary, whereby (as we gue&s;&s;e) &s;ome fifty or &s;ixty per&s;ons were taken away in a few weekes; but when we con&s;ider the nature and &s;trength of the di&s;ea&s;e, and the weakne&s;s of the meanes for pre|vention or cure, we mu&s;t acknowledge it a &s;ingular te&s;ti|monie of fatherly love, that among &s;o many thou&s;ands he tooke away &s;o few, and &s;tayed it &s;o &s;uddenly. And for that &s;hamefull di&s;ea&s;e they mention, we may &s;ee how rea|die they are to publi&s;h any thing to our di&s;grace. They might have covered this blemi&s;h, being the fir&s;t of this kind that we have knowne in the countrie, and no guilt there|of lyeing upon the government, or upon the country that we can find. There came indeed the la&s;t yeare out of England a lewd per&s;on infected with the French di&s;ea&s;e, who &s;tayed not long with us; but &s;ince his departure &s;ome others have been infected, but by what meanes we cannot find; the infection &s;preading by a worke of charitie, in drawing the brea&s;ts of one infected, but nei|ther knowne to them nor to her&s;elfe, that we can learne. But this was more ob&s;ervable (wherein the remon&s;trants might have &s;eene the good hand of the Lord toward us) that a &s;tranger coming accidentally into the country at that time, who had &s;peciall &s;kill in that di&s;ea&s;e, through the ble&s;&s;ing of God, &s;oone cured them.</P>
<P>The&s;e remon&s;trants are now come to the church doore, when one of theire companie gives them the flipp, not dareing (it &s;eemes) to enter for feare of an admonition. But let us &s;ee what exceptions the other &s;ide have to our churches, &amp;c. They tell us, <Q>that divers &s;ober, righteous, and godly men, eminent for knowledge and other gra|cious gifts of the Holy Spirit, no wayes &s;candalous in theire lives, are detained from the &s;eales, becau&s;e (as is &s;uppo&s;ed) they will not take the&s;e churches covenant.</Q> The petitioners are &s;ure mi&s;taken or mi&s;repre&s;ent the matter; for the true rea&s;ons why many per&s;ons in the country are not admitted to the &s;eales are the&s;e. Fir&s;t, many are fraudulous in theire conver&s;ation; or 2dly, noto|riou&s;ly
<PB N="214" REF="011300_0110_0F86A04D13FAC6D0">
corrupt in their opinions; or 3dly, gro&s;ly igno|rant in the principles of religion; or 4thly, if any have &s;uch knowledge and gifts, yet they doe not manife&s;t the &s;ame by any publick profe&s;&s;ion before the church or be|fore the elders, and &s;o it is not knowne that they are thus qualified. And our churches may not receive men blind-foulded, or upon other mens creditt, when they &s;hall re|fu&s;e to give account of their faith or repentance, which is &s;o expre&s;ly required, 1 Pet. 3.15. Matt. 3.6. Acts 8.37. Matt. 16.16, 17, 18. Few examples (if any) can be given of &s;uch as have manife&s;ted them&s;elves to be &s;o qualified and yet have beene refu&s;ed meerely for &s;crupleing the covenant. And it is ju&s;tly que&s;tionable whether &s;uch &s;hould be admitted to the &s;eales, who will not be &s;ubject to the di&s;cipline appointed by Chri&s;t in his churches. For what is the covenant but a &s;ubmitting them&s;elves under the ordinances of Chri&s;t, as the &s;ame are exerci&s;ed according to the rule of the word, in that church where &s;uch an one joynes as a member? Let a man profe&s;&s;edly engage him|&s;elfe hereto, and (we &s;uppo&s;e) our churches will re&s;t &s;ati&s;|fyed therewith. Our churches are not alone, nor the fir&s;t that have walked in this way. The like cour&s;e is held in the French and Dutch churches, and allowed by &s;ome of the chiefe patrons of the pre&s;byterian way: As Mr. Rath|beard, Nar. p. 16.

They &s;ay they &s;ee no light in Gods word for &s;uch a covenant, which may well be; for it appeares by other pa&s;&s;ages in theire remon|&s;trance, that they have &s;mall acquaintance therewith, or el&s;e like not to come under the power of it. And it ap|peares al&s;o, by the offence they take, to be compelled to attend to it in the publick a&s;&s;emblies. They profe&s;&s;e to
<PB N="215" REF="011300_0110_0F86A04D13FAC6D0">
approve of the covenant lately impo&s;ed by the honourable hou&s;es of parliament, and that they are all of them very willing to take &s;uch oathes and covenants as are expre&s;&s;ions of theire de&s;ires of advanceing the glory of God and good of this place, &amp;c. and yet they boggle at the covenants of the&s;e churches, which are wholely framed according to the &s;ame de&s;cription. So as it is cleare, it is not want of light (as they pretend) but &s;omething in theire owne hearts, which they &s;eeke to cover. For let them &s;tand to that profe&s;&s;ion, and they can never &s;tick at our covenants. And whereas they &s;ay they cannot perceive what our covenants are, becau&s;e they are not one and the &s;ame in every church; they might as well &s;ay, they could not un|der&s;tand our prayers and &s;ermons, becau&s;e they differ al&s;o one from another in forme of words. For the difference of our covenants in the &s;everall churches is no other. In &s;ub&s;tance (for ought we know) they all agree. And what ever the &s;everall expre&s;&s;ions may be, this &s;ufficeth us (which we conceive to be intended by them all) that in this covenant we profe&s;&s;e our engagement of relation to God, and one to another, in all the duties which belong to the publick wor&s;hip of God, and edification one of ano|ther, according to the rule of the go&s;pell.</P>
<P>Another matter which troubles them is, that they are compelled (under a &s;evere fine) every Lords day to ap|peare at the congregation. The law which they account &s;o &s;evere is this: Any two a&s;&s;i&s;tants may fine or impri&s;on &s;uch per&s;ons inhabiting here, as &s;hall u&s;ually ab&s;ent them|&s;elves from church meetings upon the Lords day, &s;o as the fine exceed not 5<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> for one offence. We cannot conceive that &s;uch &s;ober and godly men as the&s;e remon&s;trants &s;peak of, &s;hould feare any hurt by this lawe, for &s;ure &s;uch per&s;ons need not to be compelled to re&s;ort to church meetings. Therefore it &s;hould &s;eeme rather, that they would pleade for libertie for loo&s;e and irreligious per&s;ons, or for &s;uch as are tainted with &s;uch corrupt opinions as doe cau&s;e them to ca&s;t off all publick ordinances of Gods wor&s;hip, or el&s;e they would not have the civill authoritie to meddle with
<PB N="216" REF="011300_0111_0F86A04DC798C360">
men, for matters of the fir&s;t table; and &s;o they would have the 4th commandment to be ceremoniall, which ex|pre&s;ly requires that all within our gates be looked unto, that they doe not violate the Lords &s;abbath, but &s;anctify it. And if they would have all men admitted to the &s;eales of Gods covenant, they mu&s;t either allowe they may be brought to the ordinary meanes of in&s;truction, whereby they may be made fitt for the &s;ame; or el&s;e they confe&s;&s;e again&s;t them&s;elves that they would have them admit|ted in theire ignorance and profanenes.</P>
<P>They are offended al&s;o at our lawe again&s;t Anabapti&s;ts. The truth is, the great trouble we have beene putt unto and hazard al&s;o, by famili&s;ticall and anabapti&s;ticall &s;pirits, who&s;e con&s;cience and religion hath been only to &s;ett forth them&s;elves and rai&s;e contentions in the country, did pro|voke us to provide for our &s;afety by a lawe, that all &s;uch &s;hould take notice, how unwelcome they &s;hould be unto us, either comeing or &s;taying. But for &s;uch as differ from us only in judgment, in point of bapti&s;m or &s;ome other points of le&s;&s;e con&s;equence, and live peaceably among&s;t us, with|out occa&s;ioning di&s;turbance, &amp;c. &s;uch have no cau&s;e to complaine; for it hath never beene as yet putt in execu|tion again&s;t any of them, although &s;uch are knowne to live among&s;t us.</P>
<P>Another of their grievances is, that in &s;ome places they are forced to contribute to the maintenance of tho&s;e mini|&s;ters who vouch&s;afe not to take them into their flocke. They doe well to re&s;traine this grievance to &s;ome places; for it is well knowne, that in many of our churches no &s;uch cour&s;e is u&s;ed. And &s;ure we are, that none of the&s;e re|mon&s;trants were ever compelled &s;o &s;uch contribution. And although the &s;cripture &s;aith the labourour is worthy of his wages, yet there are among&s;t us &s;ome, who live under the mini&s;try of the word, them&s;elves and theire families, yeare after yeare, and yet never contribute the worth of one penny to the maintenance thereof, though they have place in the a&s;&s;embly equall to any of theire ranke, and though the wives of &s;ome of them doe commu|nicate
<PB N="217" REF="011300_0111_0F86A04DC798C360">
at the Lords table, and their children are received to bapti&s;me. And whereas they complaine that they are not accounted &s;o much as brethren, nor publickly &s;o called. The truth is, we account all our countrymen brethren by nation, and &s;uch as in charity we may judge to be be|leevers are accounted al&s;o brethren in Chri&s;t. If they be not publickly &s;o called (e&s;pecially in the church a&s;&s;emblies) it is not for want of due re&s;pect or good will towards them, but only for di&s;tinction &s;ake, to putt a difference betweene tho&s;e that doe commuicate together at the Lords table, and tho&s;e who doe not. As for that complaint of want of exerci&s;ing chri&s;tian vigilancie towards them, it is a mo&s;t untrue and unju&s;t charge. For it is evident in mo&s;t places (and for ought we know) in all, that be&s;ides the publick prayers and in&s;tructions which is common to them with the members of the church, they are admitted (&s;uch as will) to private conference and prayers; they are vi&s;ited in tymes of &s;icknes, &amp;c. as occa&s;ion requires. If any faileing be in particular members in this kind, it is again&s;t the mind of the churches and the intent of the civill government. If &s;ome duties of church di&s;cipline are not exerci&s;ed towards them, they can blame none but them|&s;elves, in that they refu&s;e to &s;ubmitt them&s;elvs thereto.</P>
<P>Concerning the bapti&s;me of the children of &s;uch as are not members of our churches, there is an a&s;&s;embly of the elders now in being, and therefore we think fitt to deferr any re&s;olution about that and &s;ome other pointes concern|ing the church di&s;cipline, untill we &s;hall under&s;tand theire conclu&s;ion therein, for further light in the&s;e things.</P>
<P>In theire conclu&s;ion, the&s;e remon&s;trants progno&s;ticate what peace and felicitie we may certainely expect both in church and common wealth, if theire petition be granted, viz. that every man be left to his owne libertie, and no di&s;tinctions or qualifications ob&s;erved, &amp;c. which they might have illu&s;trated by &s;ome examples, which we mar|vaile they omitted, e&s;pecially haveing one &s;o neere and fre&s;h; we &s;hall therefore help theire memory. They well know that &s;ome eight yeares &s;ince, here were a
<PB N="218" REF="011300_0112_0F86A05061BBD570">
certaine companie (which were petitioners and remon|&s;trants al&s;o though in another kind) who out of theire tendernes of libertie of con&s;cience, and civill libertie with|all, made greate di&s;turbance both in church and civill &s;tate, but not obtaineing their de&s;ire, and fearing &s;uch a ruine to come upon us as the&s;e remon&s;trants fore&s;ee, they removed to Rhode-I&s;land, where haveing given equall priviledge to all and e&s;tabli&s;hed this as their ba&s;is, &amp;c. that no man &s;hould ever be mole&s;ted for profe&s;&s;ing his judgment, &amp;c. they thought them&s;elves the onely happy concording people under heaven. But, alas! it was but a dreame; it was not of God and therefore could not &s;tand. For this li|berty and equallity &s;o fomented naturall corruption, as they pre&s;ently fell at variance among them&s;elves, and grew into three or foure oppo&s;ite parts, which continue to this day; and in&s;tead of e&s;tabli&s;hing church and civill &s;tate have overthrowne both.</P>
<P>Such peace, unity, pro&s;perity, &amp;c. is that which we may expect, if we will ca&s;t off the rules of Gods word, the civill prudence of all nations, and our owne ob&s;ervation of the fruite of other mens follies, and hearken to the coun|&s;ell of the&s;e new &s;tate&s;men.

<P>I Had ended as you &s;ee what I intended at this tyme, but it being &s;till in my hand I thought good to add a little more. The &s;cope of what I would expre&s;&s;e is, to ob&s;erve Gods providences in mans motions at this tyme &s;eeme plainly to tend to &s;ettle his people here, and to recover new Engli&s;h &s;pirit for Chri&s;ts kingdome againe.

The irregular departure of &s;ome cau&s;eth a deeper &s;earch of heart, wherefore God hath brought his people hither, (I will briefly mention Gods ends, as I conceive them, by and by) and the plotting of others under the alluring notion of liberty, thereby to winne the opinioni&s;ts and loo&s;er &s;ort, cau&s;es the &s;olid chri&s;tians to prize the rare and rich liberty which God hath given them, and they have deerly purcha&s;ed, (viz. in re&s;pect of men in this their great adventure) at a very high rate. Is not government in church and common weale (according to Gods owne rules) that new heaven and earth promi&s;ed, in the fullnes ac|compli&s;hed when the Jewes come in, and the fir&s;t fruites begun in this part New England, though neglected by many and oppo&s;ed by &s;ome? Now to name what &s;eemes to be Gods ende in bringing his people hether, whatever more there may be which tyme may yet di&s;cover.</P>
<P N="1">1. To be an occa&s;ion to &s;tirre up the zeale of the two nations to &s;ett upon reformation of religion, and that with good &s;ucce&s;&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. To have liberty and power to &s;ett up Gods owne ordinances in church government, and thereby to hold forth matter of conviction to the epi&s;copacy and others that this way of church government and civill government may &s;tand together.</P>
<P N="3">3. To exerci&s;e the graces of the richer &s;ort in a more mixt condition, they &s;hall have the liberty of good govern|ment in their hands, yet with the abatement of their out|ward e&s;tates. And that the poorer &s;ort (held under in England) &s;hould have inlargement.</P>
<P N="4">4. To afford a hiding place for &s;ome of his people that &s;tood for the truth while the nation was exerci&s;ed unto blood.</P>
<P N="5">5. To have an opportunity to trayne up a godly &s;killfull &s;oldiery, which &s;hortly may be imployed again&s;t that bla&s;|phemous citty. And to the&s;e may be added (at lea&s;t a &s;prinkling) of godly &s;eamen, formerly rare in the world.</P>
<P N="6">6. To make this place a rendezvous for our deare En|gli&s;h friends when they &s;hall make their voyages to the We&s;t Indies, to dry up that Euphrates.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="221" REF="011300_0113_0F86A050F946E338">7. To be hopefull in&s;truments in Gods hand to gaine the&s;e Indians to Chri&s;ts kingdome. Which mercy if at|tained in any con&s;iderable mea&s;ure will make us goe &s;ing|ing to our graves.</P>
<P>I will al&s;o mention the text preached upon at our la&s;t fa&s;t, and the propo&s;itions rai&s;ed thereupon, becau&s;e it was &s;o &s;ea&s;onable to New-Englands condition, and &s;o pro&s;ecut|ed, that did you &s;ee a coppy I thinke you would de&s;ire the &s;ermon to be &s;ett forth in printe for publick advantage.</P>

<P N="1">1. Prop. That &s;ick tymes doe pa&s;&s;e over Zion.</P>
<P N="2">2. That &s;ad and bitter neglect is the portion and ag|gravation and affliction of Zion in the tyme of its &s;ick|nes and wounds, but &s;pecially in the neglect of tho&s;e that doe neglect it, and yet notwith&s;tanding doe acknowledge it to be Zion.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the &s;ea&s;on of penitent Zions pa&s;&s;ion is the &s;ea|&s;on of God's compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>This &s;ermon tended much to the &s;ettling of godly minds here in Gods way, and to rai&s;e their &s;pirits, and as I con|ceive hath &s;utable effects.</P>
<P>I think the magi&s;trates, &amp;c. may ju&s;tly long for a happy conclu&s;ion of the Synod, that they may atte&s;t to the govern|ment of Chri&s;t in his church, and that they may with re|newed vigor attend the mighty providences in the&s;e tymes and opportunities for the advance of Chri&s;ts cau&s;e, the elders being &s;oe zealou&s;ly &s;ett thereupon.</P>
<P>Sir, its conceived this place will prove either very ho|nourable or very meene and contemptable, according as religion is attended or neglected.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Right Honourable,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FOR &s;o I mu&s;t acknowledge you, not only for the eminency of place and command which the God of power and honour hath called you unto; but al&s;o for that the Lord hath &s;at you forth as a ve&s;&s;ell of honour to his name, in working many and great deliverances for his peo|ple, and for his truth, by you; and yet helping you to re|&s;erve all the honour to him, who is the God of &s;alvation, and the Lord of hoa&s;ts, mighty in battell. I am not igno|rant that you &s;uffer no &s;mall di&s;honour in the tongues of many, not only as a &s;ectary, but as out of your calling, be|ing &s;at on worke (as is pretended) by an u&s;urped power, and your&s;elfe (with the army) exerci&s;ing a power de&s;truc|tive in &s;ome ca&s;es to the priviledges of parliament, and the liberty and &s;afety of the kingdome. But 3 or 4 principles there be, upon which it &s;eemeth to me your proceedings have been grounded and carryed on, and whein my judg|ment (rea&s;onable it is) hath been fully &s;atisfyed: 1. That the conce&s;&s;ions of the late king never came up to &s;uch a po&s;ture as whereon to lay a firme foundation of a &s;afe peace, either to church or commonwealth. 2. That when the Parliament was full, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted with the commi&s;&s;ioners of Scotland (in the treaty at Uxbridge or Newport, or el&s;ewhere) they agreed together that the king could not be re&s;tored to his former &s;tate upon &s;uch termes. And therefore (unles his conce&s;&s;ions afterwards in the I&s;le of Wight were more &s;afe and &s;atisfactory)<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is expre&s;&s;ed very cautiou&s;ly.</NOTE> if the Parliament of England voted the contrary afterwards, in a mighty con&s;ultation, it was not an act of Parliament, but a praevari|cation of a former ju&s;t and lawfull act. And therefore, when the army di&s;cerned, not only their owne &s;afetyes, but the &s;afety of religion and &s;tate, and their cau&s;e and victoryes given in defence thereof, all of them given away in that praevarication, I know not how they could have
<PB N="234" REF="011300_0120_0F86A0593739AE18">
approved their faithfullne&s;&s;e better to the &s;tate and cau&s;e, then by purging the Parliament of &s;uch corrupt humours, and pre&s;enting the king to publique tryall. 3. That the army, though they be inferiour and &s;ubordinate to the &s;tate that giveth them commi&s;&s;ion and pay; yet neither their con&s;ciences nor &s;ervices are mercenary, though they doe receive wages for their &s;upport in the &s;ervice; though &s;oldiers may take oathes of fidelity to the &s;tate, in under|taking an expedition, yet they, regarding the cau&s;e as well as the per&s;ons that &s;et them on worke, doe performe their fidelity, if they attend to the cau&s;e for which they fight, rather than to the private ends or lu&s;ts of &s;uch as &s;end them forth. Joab (the generall of Davids hoa&s;t) though he went beyond his commi&s;&s;ion in putting Ab&s;alom to death, yet not beyond his fidelity. 4. That when covenants are plighted, which con&s;i&s;t of many articles (&s;ome principall and fundamentall, others &s;ubordinate and acce&s;&s;ary) if it &s;o fall out that all the articles cannot be performed without breach of &s;ome or other, there may be ju&s;t cau&s;e of re|penting the undertaking of &s;uch covenants; but yet, if &s;ome articles cannot be performed without breach of others, the covenanters mu&s;t chiefely attend to the performance of the principall articles, though (with griefe) they be put to it to violate the &s;ubordinate. The&s;e things are &s;o cleare to mine owne apprehen&s;ion, that I am fully &s;atisfyed, that you have all this while fought the Lords battells, and the Lord hath owned you, and honoured him&s;elfe in you, in all your expeditions, which maketh my poor prayers the more &s;erious and faithfull and affectionate (as God helpeth) in your behalfe. In like frame (as I conceive) are the &s;pirits of our brethren (the elders and churches of the&s;e parts) carried forth, and the Lord accept us, and help you in Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>If you a&s;ke upon what &s;tructure I have made thus bold to addre&s;&s;e my&s;elfe in the&s;e rude lynes to your Lord&s;hip, I mu&s;t acknowledge it is abhorrent from my native ba&s;h|fullne&s;&s;e to run into the pre&s;ence of great men: But I received the other day a letter from my reverend brother Mr. Hooker of Newhaven, who certifyeth me that your Lord&s;hip made &s;peciall mention of me in your late letters

to him, with tender of loving and more re&s;pectfull &s;aluta|tions than I could expect; withall he moved me to write to your Lord&s;hip, as believing you would accept the &s;ame in good part. This is my excu&s;e, &s;uch as it is.</P>
<P>The Scots, whom God delivered into your hands at Dunbarre, and whereof &s;undry were &s;ent hither, we have been de&s;irous (as we could) to make their yoke ea&s;y. Such as were &s;ick of the &s;curvy or other di&s;ea&s;es have not want|ed phy&s;ick and chyrurgery. They have not been &s;old for &s;laves to perpetuall &s;ervitude, but for 6 or 7 or 8 yeares, as we do our owne; and he that bought the mo&s;t of them (I heare) buildeth hou&s;es for them, for every 4 an hou&s;e, layeth &s;ome acres of ground thereto, which he giveth them as their owne, requiring 3 dayes in the weeke to worke for him (by turnes) and 4 dayes for them&s;elves, and promi&s;eth, a&s;&s;oone as they can repay him the money he layed out for them, he will &s;et them at liberty.</P>
<P>As for the a&s;per&s;ion of factious men, I hear, by Mr. De&s;boroughs letter la&s;t night, that you have well vindicated your&s;elfe therefrom by ca&s;hiering &s;undry corrupt &s;pirits out of the army. And truly, Sir, better a few and faith|full, than many and un&s;ound.

Go on therefore (good Sir) to overcome your&s;elfe (Prov. 16.32.) to overcome your army, (Deut. 29.9, with v. 14.) and to vindicate your orthodoxe integrity to the world.</P>
<P>Pardon, I be&s;eech you, my boldne&s;&s;e and rudene&s;&s;e, which not arrogancy but due re&s;pect and ob&s;ervancy to your Lord&s;hip hath put upon me.</P>

The Lord hath marvelou&s;ly appeared even again&s;t them; and now again when all the power was devolved into the Scotti&s;h Kinge and the malignant partie, they invading England, the Lord has rayned upon them &s;uch &s;nares as the enclo&s;ed will &s;hew, only the narrative is &s;hort in this, that of their whole armie, when the narrative was framed, not five of their whole armie were returned. Surely Sir, the Lord is greatly to be feared, as to be prai&s;ed, wee need the prayers in this as much as ever. How &s;hall wee behave our&s;elves after &s;uch mercy? What is the Lord a doinge? What prophe&s;ies are now fulfilling? Who is a God like ours? to know his will, to do his will are both of him. I took this liberty from bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;a|lute you thus in a word, truly I am readie to &s;erve you and the re&s;t of our brethren and the churches with you. I am a poore weak creature and not worthy the name of a worme, yet accepted to &s;erve the Lord and his people, indeed my deare friend between you and me you know not me, my weakne&s;&s;es, my inordinate pa&s;&s;ions, my un&s;kil|fulne&s;s, and every way unfitne&s;&s;e to my worke, yet, yet, the Lord who will have mercye on whome he will, does

<HEAD>An An&s;wer to the Propo&s;itions pre&s;ented by the honored French Agent to the Pre&s;ident and Commi&s;&s;ioners for the Engli&s;h united Colonies.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. UPON due con&s;ideration and re&s;pect of what the honnored deputyes from the illu&s;trious Governor of New-France have informed and upon experience our|&s;elves have had of the in&s;olency and treachery of &s;ome of the barbarians, we can conceive and grant, that the French and tho&s;e ea&s;terne Indians may have ju&s;t grounds to their owne &s;afisfaction, for a warr again&s;t the Mohawks.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Engli&s;h looke upon all &s;uch Indians as receive the yoke of Chri&s;t with another eye than upon tho&s;e that wor&s;hip the Divell.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Engli&s;h de&s;ire by all ju&s;t meanes to keep peace (if it may be) with all men, even with the&s;e barbarians.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Mohawkes, living at a di&s;tance from the &s;ea, have little intercour&s;e in the&s;e parts, but in the warr the Engli&s;h had with the Indians 14 or 16 yeares &s;ince, the Mohawkes &s;hewed a reall re&s;pect, and have not &s;ince done any knowne ho&s;tile acts again&s;t them.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Engli&s;h engage not in any warr before they have full and &s;atisfying evidence, that in all re&s;pects and con&s;iderations it is ju&s;t, and before peace upon ju&s;t termes hath been offered and refu&s;ed.</P>
<P N="6">6. The Mohawkes are neither in &s;ubjection nor league with the Engli&s;h, &s;o that we can neither require any account of their warres, or other proceedings, nor have we meanes to informe our&s;elves what they can &s;ay for them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="7">7. If all other con&s;iderations were cleered, to make warr with the Mohawkes may endanger all our neighbour
<PB N="241" REF="011300_0123_0F86A05B77110FA8">
Indians (of which divers profe&s;&s;e chri&s;tianity) and the re&s;t doe rather expect ju&s;t protection than that we &s;hould ex|po&s;e them, by our voluntary invading the Mohawkes.</P>
<P N="8">8. Though the Engli&s;h in the&s;e juri&s;dictions are free to performe all neighbourly offices of righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace, towards the French collonie, yet they fore&s;ee they can neither permitt volunteeres or auxilliary forces to be taken up again&s;t the Mohawkes, nor that the French or ea&s;tern Indians pa&s;&s;e through the Engli&s;h juri&s;dictions, to invade them, but they &s;hall expo&s;e both the chri&s;tian and other Indians and &s;ome of the &s;maller Engli&s;h plantations to dainger.</P>
<P N="9">9. The Engli&s;h are much un&s;attisfied with that mi&s;|chievous trade the French and Dutch have had and &s;till continue, &s;elling gunns, powder and &s;hott to all the In|dians, of which we have dayly complaints, and by which the Indians are animated and apt to grow in&s;olent not only again&s;t Indian converts and catechumens, but again&s;t the chri&s;tians of Europe.</P>
<P N="10">10. If the Engli&s;h colonies were a&s;&s;ured of the ju&s;tice of this warre, and engaged with the French to pro&s;ecute again&s;t the Mohawkes, yet we have no &s;uch &s;hort and convenient pa&s;&s;age either by water or land to approach them, as may be had up Hud&s;ons river, to and beyond Aurania forte, which is in the Dutch juri&s;diction.</P>
<P N="11">11. They hope the auncient peace and amitye betwixt England and France will be continued and confirmed, which they both de&s;ire and as far as lyes in them &s;hall by all due meanes readily promote.</P>
<P N="12">12. They conceave that the honored deputies have power and authoritie at pre&s;ent to agree and &s;ettle a free commerce betweene the Engli&s;h and French colonies in the&s;e parts, but if the &s;aid deputyes, upon rea&s;ons knowne to them&s;elves, &s;ee cau&s;e to limitt the Engli&s;h colonies to &s;uch re&s;trictions, or rather prohibitions as the unpriviledged French are under, that they may not trade till they have fir&s;t procured a particular licence from the Governor and Councell of New-France, at lea&s;t till they have i&s;&s;ued the

<P>The Engli&s;h Colonies, as in the 2d article, are ready upon a fitt opportunity to &s;hew all due re&s;pect to all truly converted and chri&s;tian Indians, and much more than to others, but while they live at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the En|gli&s;h juri&s;dictions they neither may promi&s;e nor afford them any protection to &s;ecure them from dainger.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Ma&s;&s;a.

<HEAD>Concerning the life of the famous Mr. Cotton, teacher to the church of Chri&s;t at Bo&s;ton in New-England.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT I have to adde concerning the life of this ble&s;&s;ed man of God now tryumphing in glory, to what hath been already &s;et forth by the reverend Mr. Davenport, the worthy pa&s;tor of the church of Chri&s;t at New-Haven, I &s;hall hold forth in the&s;e particulars. 1. Concerning the place of his birth and education, till he went to the univer&s;ity and his abode in Cambridge. 2dly, Concerning his removall from Cambridge to Bo&s;ton in Lyncoln&s;hire, and what he met with and did there. 3dly. Concerning his departure from thence into New-England, and what &s;ervice the Lord made him an in&s;trument of in that remote country. For the fir&s;t,</P>
<P>The place of his birth was the towne of Derby, the mo&s;t eminent place in that country; his father trained him up to &s;uch learning as the &s;choole afforded, for the fitting him for Cambridge, whither he went when he was very young, at 13 years of age, and was admitted into the famous &s;ociety of Trinity-College, where he fell &s;oe hard to his &s;tudie, and &s;oe profitted in the knowledge of the tongues and arts that he had undoubtedly beene fel|low there, but that at that time their great hall was then
<PB N="243" REF="011300_0124_0F86A05C5418AF10">
in building, which cau&s;ed &s;uch expences to them that the election was put by or at lea&s;t deferred till &s;ome longer time. And this providence I cannot pa&s;&s;e by concerning him, that his father (who&s;e calling was to be imployed in the &s;tuddy and practi&s;e of the law) had not many clients that made u&s;e of his advice in law matters before, it plea&s;ed God after he was gone to Cambridge, to put his father upon great practi&s;e, &s;oe that he was very able to keepe him there and allow him liberall maintenance; in&s;oemuch that the ble&s;&s;ed man &s;aid, God kept me at the univer&s;ity. From Trinity colledge he removed to Emanuel colledge, the happy &s;eminary of learning and piety, where he was honoured with a fellow&s;hip in that &s;ociety, after a diligent and &s;trict examen, according to the &s;tatutes of that hou&s;e: wherein this is worth the taking notice of, that when the po&s;er came to examine him in the Hebrew tongue, the place where he was to be examined was that in I&s;ai. 3. that &s;peakes again&s;t the bravery of woemen, which hath more hard words together than any place in the Bible within &s;oe narrow a compa&s;&s;e, and might have po&s;ed a very good Hebrician, but he was very ready at it, and all tho&s;e difficult words were ea&s;y to him. Afterwards he was head-lecturer and dean and catechi&s;t in the colledge, and was a diligent tutor to many pupills and very much be|loved of them: His exerci&s;es that he performed in the colledge, whether in way of common-place or di&s;pute, wanted not &s;innewes and &s;trength, were highly commended and applauded of tho&s;e that knew him. The fir&s;t time that he became famous throughout the whole univer&s;ity, was from a funerall oration which he made in latine for Doctor Some, who was Ma&s;ter of Peter-hou&s;e, which was &s;oe elegantly and oratoriou&s;ly performed that he was much admired for it by the greate&s;t witts in the univer&s;ity. After that, being called to preach at the univer&s;ity church called St. Maries, he was yet more famous for that &s;ermon, and very much applauded by all the gallant &s;chollars for it: After that, being called to preach there againe, God helped him not to flaunt, as before, but to make a plain, hone&s;t
<PB N="244" REF="011300_0125_0F86A05F30920948">
&s;ermon, which was ble&s;&s;ed of God to famous Dr. Pre&s;ton's &s;oules eternal good: His <HI>Concio ad Clerum,</HI> when he tooke his degree for Bachelor of Divinity, which was after he had beene at Bo&s;ton halfe a yeare or more, was very much admired and applauded more than he de&s;ired; his text was out of Math. 5.13. <HI>Vos e&s;tis &s;al terrae, qu&ograve;d &s;i &s;al in|fatuatus fuerit, quo &s;alietur?</HI> In handling of which, both the matter and the rhetorical &s;treighnes, elegancy of phra&s;e, and &s;weet and grave pronunciation rendered him yet more famous in the univer&s;ity; and &s;oe did his an&s;wering of the divinity act in the &s;chools, though he had a very nimble opponent, Mr. William Chappel by name, who di&s;puted with him.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Concerning his removal from Cambridge to Bo&s;ton in Lyncoln&s;hire, this is to be &s;aide, that his call was good, for their de&s;ire was urgent, their need pre&s;&s;ed, their a&s;&s;em|bly of people very great, him&s;elfe very able, and his heart inclining to come to them. At his fir&s;t coming he found &s;ome ob&s;truction from the Bi&s;hop of the Dioce&s;&s;e, which was B. Barlow, who told him he was a young man and unfit to be over &s;uch a factious people: Mr. Cotton being ingenuous and undervaluing him&s;elfe, thought &s;oe too, and was purpo&s;ing to returne to the colledge againe; but &s;ome of Mr. Cotton's Bo&s;ton friends under&s;tanding that one Simon Biby was to be &s;poken with, which was near the Bi&s;hop,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which &s;ome called Simony &amp; Bribery.</NOTE> they pre|&s;ently charmed him, and &s;o the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e went on &s;mooth, and Mr. Cotton was a learned man with the Bi&s;hop, and he was admitted into the place, after their manner in tho&s;e dayes. Well, to Bo&s;ton the good man came, and for 3 yeares he preached and lived &s;oe among&s;t them, that they accounted them&s;elves happy (as they well might) in the enjoyment of him, both the towne and country thereabout being much bettered by him: But it plea&s;ed God, after 3 or 4 yeares being there, that he could not dige&s;t the ceremonies that were &s;oe pre&s;&s;ed, nor conformity to them, which in &s;ome &s;pace of time after bred him trouble in the court of Lyncolne, from
<PB N="245" REF="011300_0125_0F86A05F30920948">
which he was advi&s;ed to appeale to a higher court, and imploying Mr. Leverit (which was afterwards one of the ruling elders of the church at Bo&s;ton in N. E.) to deale in that bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, and he being a plaine man as Jacob was, yet &s;ubtile to get &s;uch a &s;piritual ble&s;&s;ing, &s;oe far in&s;inuated him&s;elfe into one of the proctors of the high court, that he &s;ware <HI>in animam Domini,</HI> that Mr. Cotton was a con|formable man, and &s;o he was re&s;tored to Bo&s;ton; as likewi&s;e by the meanes that a gentleman of Bo&s;ton, called Mr. Ben|net, u&s;ed to bring him in againe: After which he was marvelous &s;ucce&s;sful in his mini&s;try, till he had beene 20 yeares there, and in that 20 yeares &s;pace, he on Lords-day, on afternoones, went over, thrice, the whole body of divinity in a catechi&s;tical way, and gave the heads of his di&s;cour&s;e to tho&s;e that were young &s;chollars and others in that towne, to an&s;wer to his que&s;tions in publique, in that great congregation, and after their an&s;wers he opened tho&s;e heads of divinity and &s;weetly applyed all to the edification of his people, and to &s;uch &s;trangers as came to heare him: In the morning on the Lords-day, he preach|ed over the fir&s;t &s;ix chapters of the go&s;pel by John, the whole booke of Eccle&s;ia&s;tes, the prophe&s;ye of Zephaniah, and many other &s;criptures, and when the Lords &s;upper was admini&s;tred (which was u&s;ually every month) he preached upon 1 Cor. 11. and the whole 30th chapter of the 2 Chron. and &s;ome other &s;criptures about the Lords &s;up|per: On his lecture dayes he preached through the whole 1&s;t and 2d epi&s;tles of John, the whole booke of Solomons &s;ong, the Parables of our Saviour &s;et forth in Matthewes go&s;pel to the end of cap. 16. comparing them with Mark and Luke. He tooke much paines in private, and read to &s;undry young &s;chollars that were in his hou&s;e, and &s;ome that came out of Germany, and had his hou&s;e full of au|ditors. Afterwards, &s;eeing &s;ome inconveniences in the peoples flocking to his hou&s;e, be&s;ides his ordinary lecture on the 5th day of the weeke, he preached thrice more on the weeke dayes, on the 4th and 6th dayes, early in the morning, and on the la&s;t day at 3 of the clock in the after|noone;
<PB N="246" REF="011300_0126_0F86A0606209DA18">
only the&s;e 3 la&s;t lectures were performed by him but &s;ome few yeares before he had another famous col|league with him, and not many yeares before he left Bo&s;ton: He alwayes preached at the election of their mayors and at that time when they tooke their oath and were in&s;talled in their office; and alwayes (if he were at home) at the funerals of tho&s;e of the abler &s;ort that died: He was frequent in duties of humiliation and thank&s;giving, in which I have knowne him in prayer and opening the word and applying it, 5 or 6 houres, &s;oe indefatigable he was in the Lords worke, and &s;oe ready to &s;pend and be &s;pent for his peoples &s;oules: He was of admirable candor, of unparalleled meekne&s;&s;e, of rare wi&s;dome, very loving even to tho&s;e that differed in judgment from him, yet one that held his owne &s;toutly, <HI>arct&egrave; tenens accurat&egrave;que defen|dens,</HI> what him&s;elfe judged to be the truth. He an&s;wered many letters that were &s;ent far and neare, wherein were handled many difficult ca&s;es of con&s;cience, and many doubts by him cleared, to the greate&s;t &s;atisfaction. He was ex|ceedingly beloved of the be&s;t, and admired and reverenced of the wor&s;t of his hearers. Nothing was wanting to make him a compleat mini&s;ter, nothing lacking to make him a perfect chri&s;tian, but the perfection of grace which he hath now attained to, and the glory he hath now arrived at. He was a man that was in great favour with Dr. Wil|liams the Bi&s;hop of Lincolne, who admired him for his learning, and (as I have beene told) when he was lord keeper of the great &s;eale, he went to King James, and &s;peaking of Mr. Cottons great learning and worth before him, the King was willing, notwith&s;tanding his non-confor|mity, to give way that he &s;hould have his liberty, to goe on without interruption in his mini&s;try, which was very marvelous, con&s;idering how the Kings &s;pirit was carryed out again&s;t &s;uch men; the my&s;tery of which Mr. Samuel Ward of Ip&s;wich being ignorant of, &s;pake merrily among &s;ome of his friends: Of all men in the world I envy Mr. Cotton of Bo&s;ton mo&s;t, for he doth nothing in way of conformity, and yet hath his liberty, and I doe every

thing that way and cannot enjoy mine. He had many enemies at Bo&s;ton, as well as many friends, and &s;ome that ro&s;e up again&s;t him and plotted &s;ecretly to undermine him, and others that practi&s;ed more openly again&s;t him; but they all of them were bla&s;ted, either in their names, or in their e&s;tates, or in their familyes, or in their devices, or el&s;e came to untimely deathes, which &s;hewes how God both owned his &s;ervant in his holy labours, and that in the things wherein they dealt proudly again&s;t him, he would be above them.</P>
<P>One thing more, and I have done with him as he was one of Englands gloryes, and then come to him as over the Atlantique ocean, and in New-England, and it is this; concerning his ho&s;pitality, wherein he did exceed mo&s;t that ever I heard of, and e&s;pecially his heart and doores were open to receive (as all that feared God, &s;oe) e&s;pecially godly mini&s;ters, which he mo&s;t curteou&s;ly entertained, and many other &s;trangers be&s;ides; only one mini&s;ter, Mr. Hacket by name, which had got into the fellow&s;hip of famous Mr. Arthur Heilder&s;ham, with many other godly mini&s;ters, and being acquainted with their &s;ecrets, betrayed them into the prelates hands; this man coming into Bo&s;ton and meeting with Mr. Cotton, the good man had not the heart to &s;peake to him, nor invite him to his hou&s;e, which he &s;aid he never did to any &s;tranger that he knew before, much le&s;&s;e to any mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>Concerning the la&s;t thing, viz. his departure from Bo&s;ton to New-England. The times growing perillous, he was envied of &s;ome at home and others abroad; and letters mi&s;&s;ive were come to convent him before the high-commi&s;&s;ion-court, and a profligate fellow and a filthy for|nicator, Gowen John&s;on by name (who not long after dyed of the plague) was to bring the letters to him, as he did to &s;ome others near him, which when Mr. Cotton under|&s;tood, he looked for nothing from the court but &s;cornes and pri&s;on, and therefore with advice from many able heades and gracious hearts, he kept clo&s;e for a time, and fitted him&s;elfe to goe to N. E. and God bringing him and his

company over in &s;afety, through his mercy, after they had beene there a while, there grew &s;ome trouble betweene tho&s;e that were to &s;ettle matters in church and common|wealth, but Mr. Cotton then preaching before the general court an excellent &s;ermon out of Hag. 2. Be &s;trong Ze|rubbabel, and be &s;trong Jo&s;hua, and be &s;trong ye people of the land, &amp;c. it plea&s;ed God &s;oe to compo&s;e and calme and quiet &s;pirits, that all apprehen&s;ions were laid a&s;ide, and they went about the worke of the Lord very comfortably and were much encouraged. After which time how u&s;e|full he was to England, to New-England, to magi&s;trates, mini&s;ters, people, in publique, in private, by preachings, coun&s;ells, di&s;&s;olving hard knots, and an&s;wering difficult que&s;tions, all knew, that knew the grace of God &s;oe evi|dently manife&s;ted in him. What &s;criptures he went over on Lords dayes in expounding and preaching, I cannot certainly &s;ay, becau&s;e I was of another church, &s;erving there according to the grace be&s;towed upon me; but &s;urely he went through very many, for on his lecture dayes he preached over the whole booke of the Revelation, Eccle&s;ia&s;tes and Canticles, the 2d and 3d Epi&s;tles of John, the 2 Epi&s;tles of Timothy, with divers others, all which &s;hews the unwearied paines which he tooke in the Lords worke, be&s;ides all the bookes that were written by him, and other unknowne labours that he went through. I could &s;peake much more, but at this pre&s;ent want &s;trength, but this I &s;ay, he may be a patterne to us all, and happy they that come neare&s;t him, in tho&s;e things wherein he mo&s;t followed Chri&s;t. I am not like to live to &s;ee &s;uch another in N. E. though I know God is able to double the &s;pirit of that Elias upon him that &s;ucceeds him, and upon many others in our native country and here. It is well for both the Bo&s;tons, that they had &s;uch a light, if they walke in the light, and continue in that word of Chri&s;t and light of grace and truth that he held out to them. I end all with that of our Saviour concerning John-Bapti&s;t, he was a burning and &s;hining light, and God graunt the after words be not verified of both Englands

<OPENER>To the right reverend and my very honourable good Lord, John Lord Bi&s;hop of Lincoln, at his pallace in Kurkden, pre&s;ent the&s;e. <SALUTE>My very good Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is now above twenty yeares agoe, &s;ince by the good|nes of God and (for a good part of this time) by your Lord&s;hips lawfull favour, I have enjoyed the happines to mini&s;ter to the church of God at Bo&s;ton, a remote corner of your Lord&s;hips dioce&s;&s;e. What I have done there, all this while, and how I have &s;pent my time and cour&s;e, I mu&s;t ere long give account to the great &s;hepherd of the &s;heep, the bi&s;hop of our &s;oules. Meane while, give me leave to make your Lord&s;hip this &s;hort account: The bent of my cour&s;e hath been (according to my weake mea|&s;ure) to make and keep a 3 fold chri&s;tian concord among&s;t the people; between God and their con&s;cience; between true hearted loyaltie and chri&s;tian liberty; between the fear of God and the love of one another. That wherein I have mo&s;t &s;eemed to your Lord&s;hip to fayle (to witt in not di&s;cerning chri&s;tian liberty to practi&s;e &s;ome commands of authority, in &s;ome circum&s;tances) I doe humbly thanke your Lord&s;hip, and freely acknowledge, your Lord&s;hip
<PB N="250" REF="011300_0128_0F86A06185FD2078">
hath not been wanting freely and often to admoni&s;h me thereof, and that with &s;uch wi&s;dom and gravity, and with &s;uch well tempered authority and mildne&s;s, that I profe&s;s unfeynedly noe outward re&s;pect in the world could have deteyned me from reque&s;ting your Lord&s;hips favour with ready &s;ubjection to your Lord&s;hips coun&s;ell, that I might have prolonged myne owne peace and your Lord&s;hips fa|vour together, but &s;o it is (my good Lord) though I doe unfeynedly and de&s;ervedly honour your Lord&s;hip, and highly e&s;teem many hundreths of other reverend divines, great lights of the church (in compari&s;on of whom what am I poore &s;parke?) who doubt not of their liberty in tho&s;e matters; yet to this day (I &s;peake in the &s;implicity of my heart) I can only follow your Lord&s;hip with ob&s;er|vance, and them with reverence, but not with that plero|phory of fayth in the&s;e thinges which in &s;uch ca&s;es the apo&s;tle requireth, Rom. 14.5. Your Lord&s;hip well knoweth it is both the apo&s;tles and prophets principle (and it holdeth in every righteous man from the meane&s;t to the greate&s;t) <HI>Ju&s;tus ex fide &s;u&acirc; vivit, non alien&acirc;,</HI> and therefore, how&s;oever I doe highly prize and much preferre other mens judgment and learning, and wi&s;dom, and piety, yet in thinges pertaining to God and his wor&s;hip, &s;till, I mu&s;t (as I ought) live by mine own fayth, not theirs. Neverthele&s;s, where I cannot yeeld obedience of fayth, I am willing to yeeld patience of hope.</P>
<P>And now, my good lord, I &s;ee the Lord who began a yeare or two agoe to &s;u&s;pend (after a &s;ort) my mini&s;try from that place by a long and &s;oare &s;ickne&s;s (the dregs whereof &s;till hang about me) doth now putt a further ne|ce&s;&s;ity upon me, wholly to lay down my mini&s;try there, and freely to re&s;igne my place into your Lord&s;hips hands. For I &s;ee neither my bodily health, nor the peace of the church will now &s;tand with my continuance there. I doe now therefore humbly crave this la&s;t favour at your Lord|&s;hips hand, to accept my place as voyd, and to admitt there|to &s;uch a &s;ucce&s;&s;or as your Lord&s;hip &s;hall finde fitt, and the patron (which is the corporation of Bo&s;ton) &s;hall pre&s;ent to

you therefor. The congregation is great, and the church duetyes many, and tho&s;e, many times, requiring clo&s;e atten|dance, and I would be very loth the &s;ervice of God, or the helpe of the people &s;hould be in any &s;ort neglected by my long di&s;continuance.</P>
<P>What though this re&s;ignation of my place into your Lord&s;hips hands may be defective in &s;ome forme of law; yet I tru&s;t your Lord&s;hip will never forgett the auncient moderation and aequity of that honourable and high court of chauncery, whereunto your Lord&s;hip was advanced, to temper the rigour of legall ju&s;tice, to the relief of many di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. Never (I thinke) came there any cau&s;e before your Lord&s;hip more di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, nor more ju&s;tly craving chri&s;tian aequity.</P>
<P>Now the Lord of heaven and earth &s;oe guide and keep and ble&s;&s;e your Lord&s;hip on earth, that he may delight to crown your Lord&s;hip with honour in heaven, at the end of your dayes, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Thus at once com|mending my hmmble &s;ute and late vicarage, and the com|fort of the whole congregation to your Lord&s;hips honour|able favour and integrity, I humbly take leave and re&s;t</P>

And truly you would wonder had wee but time to relate the &s;everall &s;orts of objections, which for the mo&s;t part turne all to ob&s;tructions for a &s;ea&s;on; till by the elaborate paines of Mr. Win&s;low, wee are forced to take off and remove the &s;ame, you wrote to us not to &s;end any more goods till you &s;ent for them, and to tye our&s;elves to &s;uch and only &s;uch provi&s;ions to be &s;ent.

Now whether it be or no wee know not, but verily believe the worke will &s;uffer &s;ome thou&s;ands of pounds by it, for it flyeth like lightning and takes like tinder, men being extreame glad

to meete with any thing may colour over theire covetou&s;|nes, and dull theire zeale in &s;o good a worke: Nay Mr. Peters who, but fourteene daies before, told Mr. Win&s;low in plaine termes he heard the worke was but a plaine cheate, and that there was no &s;uch thing as go&s;pell con|ver&s;ion among&s;t the Indians, pre&s;ently after, charged the &s;ame man upon a letter he received from Mr. Weld, by information from Mr. Elliot that you the commi&s;&s;ioners for the united colonies forbad the worke in that you would not allow competent maintenance to Mr. Elliot, and others that laboured therein; and however wee have otherwi&s;e charitable thoughts of Peters yett he hath been a very bad in&s;trument all along towards this worke, who (though of a committee in the army for the advance of it among&s;t them) yett prote&s;ted again&s;t contributing a penny to|wards it in per&s;on, and indeede &s;ome of us have been faine to intreate the re&s;t of the gentlemen not to trouble him any further in the bu&s;ines, nor know wee any cau&s;e unle&s;&s;e it be that the worke is coming to &s;uch perfection and he hath not had the lea&s;t hand or finger in it.

<P>MY &s;elfe, who&s;e name is underwritten, being impowered by the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the united Colonies, bearing date the 25th Sept. 1654, doe declare the particular acts of the proceeding of the councill of warre being a&s;&s;embled at Thomas Stantons, according to the in&s;tructions received from the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ioners, as followeth.</P>
<P>Imprimis, our fir&s;t in&s;truction being forthwith to march into the Nyanticke countrey, the place of Ninnigrets or|dinary place of re&s;idence, and to demand of him (if he may be &s;poke with) the Pequotts, &amp;c. The rea&s;ons why wee did not attend to that particular was, wee knew he was removed from that place up into the woods into a &s;wamp, &s;ome 15 myles from our quarters, and further, by a &s;torm the boates of Conecticott and Newhaven, whereas all were to meete 13 October 54, we &s;ay, the boates and &s;ome of the &s;ouldiers with their &s;tocke of ammunition came not to us untill the 16th day the one, and the 17th day the other. Further, we had one clau&s;e in our in&s;tructions to act as might &s;tand with the honour of the Engli&s;h and the &s;afety of the countrey, but for us to move with our forces wee thought it would make great rumour to &s;tirr among&s;t the Indians, when they &s;hould heare wee were returned to our quarters and did nothing; therefore wee thought it would expedite our worke to attend that that was pre&s;ented to us, which are as followeth.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="011300_0135_0F86A068F8A00478">Fir&s;t, Ninnegret haveing &s;ome of his Indians pre&s;ent with us, who as we &s;uppo&s;ed were willing to &s;alve up things as well as they could, we agreed to &s;end &s;ome of them to him to advi&s;e him to come and &s;peake with us, but we haveing intelligence of his great feare to con&s;ent to this motion, wee offered him ho&s;tages for the &s;ecurity of his per&s;on, and if this plea&s;ed him not, he &s;hould acquaint us what he would de&s;ire to &s;ecure him; his an&s;wer was, by 4 of his men, that one of our Indians had taken away a canoe of his and made prize of it, and upon this he was more afraid than before.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, He demanded what he had done to the Engli&s;h that they came &s;o again&s;t him round about, and will not let him alone, and he would de&s;ire to tran&s;act this bu&s;ines by me&s;&s;engers, and not come face to face.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, He &s;aid his father was a friend to the Engli&s;h in former times, and he wondered they &s;hould be &s;o again&s;t him now. Our an&s;wer to the&s;e things were as followeth. Fir&s;t, wee knew nothing of the canoe, and that if any of our Indians had wronged him in this kind they &s;hould re&s;tore it againe; but they would not forbeare this di&s;|cour&s;e, &s;o wee &s;ent them away with the&s;e following an|&s;wers, Fir&s;t, wee wondered that he, a wi&s;e man as he would be accounted, that he &s;hould offer to hold us in di&s;cour&s;e about &s;uch a trifle as a canoe is, either he mu&s;t be unwi&s;e him&s;elfe, or thinke us unwi&s;e, if wee &s;hould be delayed with &s;uch things at the&s;e. 2dly, That it was not the fa&s;hion of the Engli&s;h to tran&s;act things of &s;uch a nature by me&s;|&s;engers from an amba&s;&s;ador, but to come face to face. 3dly, If this cour&s;e might have beene taken, wee could have done this from the place of our habitation, without rai&s;ing the&s;e forces. The 16th, there came &s;ome of the Pequotts and told us that, the day before this, they went to|wards Ninnegretts company to per&s;wade their kindred to come from him, fearing otherwi&s;e it would goe ill with them, but they met with three Pequotts that did adhere to Ninegrett, who a&s;ked them what they did there, they &s;aid they had &s;omething to doe; then they a&s;ked our Pequotts
<PB N="266" REF="011300_0136_0F86A069B4EE9920">
how many there were of them, they &s;aid 30, then &s;aid the 3 men there are 30 heads for us; then our Pequotts &s;aid they did attend the Engli&s;h to carrey letters or burthens abroad, where the Engli&s;h &s;hould have occa&s;ion to &s;end them, then one of the 3 men told them they would have their 30 heads before to morrow in the afternoone, though the Engli&s;h men were with them, and they &s;aid they would not de&s;ert from the warr again&s;t the Long I&s;landers, neither would they for&s;ake Ninegrett. This day they came into us and gave in their names to the number of 73. The 17th day there came into us more Pequotts that lived neere to Ninegrett, which, before, wee com|manded to bring away their hou&s;es and goods, which things they did, and gave in their names as the re&s;t to the num|ber of 36. The 18th day, Ninegrett &s;till keeping off and would no ways comply with us, wee agreed and &s;ent two gentlemen with two to attend them, and two inter|preters to make &s;ome demands of him; but there being &s;ixe he refu&s;ed to &s;peake with above two of them, but after much debate with his &s;cours and &s;ome of his chiefe men, they came to &s;peake with them, viz. Capt. Davis and Capt. Seely, and fir&s;t they demanded the Pequotts under him, his an&s;wer was, why doe yee demand the Pequotts of me when you have them already? they demanded more, his an&s;wer was he had not above 3 or 4 with him, but the re&s;t were di&s;po&s;ed abroad a hunting and el&s;ewhere, but in the i&s;&s;ue he ingaged by writing to &s;urrender all that were under him into the hands of Mr. Winthrop or Capt. Ma&s;on within &s;even days. 2dly, They demanded the tribute due for the Pequotts, his an&s;wer was he never engaged for them; he was told he payd it at New-Haven; he &s;aid the rea&s;on of that was he feared they would have been taken from him, therefore he payd 9 or 10 fathom of his owne peage to make up the &s;ome. 3dly, They further required not to make any more war again&s;t the Long I&s;land Indians, to this he was &s;ilent for a time, but after &s;aid this; Shall &s;uch a prince and two &s;uch captains loo&s;e their lives and their blood not be revenged? the an&s;wer to this was,

he mu&s;t act in a right way by making the commi&s;&s;ioners acquainted with it, but he was &s;ilent. Further he was charged not to mole&s;t them nor any other of the friends of the Engli&s;h le&s;t his head were &s;et up upon an Engli&s;h pole. Al&s;o he was informed that none of ours &s;hould mole&s;t him. 4thly, The charges of this expedition was demanded of him, his an&s;wer was he was not the cau&s;e of it, but the Long I&s;land Indians killed him a man at Connecticott.</P>

<P>ABOUT twelve days &s;ince I wrote to you by Capt. Collens, wherein I gave you a large account of our proceedings in this i&s;land of the Barbadoes; how that by Gods ble&s;&s;ing we attained our pa&s;&s;age in five weekes, made the 2500 men we landed 6000, and becau&s;e our &s;tores for the army were not as yet come up clo&s;e we &s;hould lo&s;e the drie &s;ea&s;on and my lords honor &s;uffer there|by and have &s;crabled up &s;o many arms as to make the 1500, we here brought, 6000 or near thereabout: that we rai&s;ed two &s;mall troopes of hor&s;e upon the i&s;land and gotten &s;uch and &s;o many other &s;tores as we are to &s;ett &s;aile this evening from the place: We thought to have gone the 24th in|&s;tant but could not attaine thereunto. Since which time came Capt. Ha&s;&s;efield of London and tells us of the Great Charity, that &s;he was at &s;ea with him; but &s;aies that &s;he with many others in company were forced back by the fowle weather. This gentleman was above two months, from Falmouth hither, and tells us our &s;tore&s;hips were in the Downes with a &s;afe convoy and believes they will

<SALUTE>Much honoured Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is my humble and earne&s;t petition unto God and you, that you may &s;o be plea&s;ed to exerci&s;e command over your own &s;pirits that you may not mind my&s;elfe nor the Engli&s;h of the&s;e parts (unworthy with my&s;elf of your eye) but only that face of equitie (Engli&s;h and chri&s;tian) which I humbly hope may appeare in the&s;e repre&s;entations following.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="011300_0141_0F86A070745B36A8">Fir&s;t, May it plea&s;e you to remember, that concerning the town of Warwick (in this colonie) there lies a &s;uite of &pound;. 2000 dammages again&s;t you before his highnes and the lords of his councell, I doubt not if you &s;o plea&s;e but that (as Mr. Win&s;low and my&s;elf had well nigh ordered it) &s;ome gentlemen from your&s;elves and &s;ome from Warwick deputed, may friendly and ea&s;ily determine that affair be|tweene you.</P>
<P>Secondly, The Indians which pretend your name at Warwick and Pawtuxet (and yet live as barbarou&s;ly if not more than any in the country) plea&s;e you to know their in&s;olences upon our&s;elves and cattell (unto &pound;. 20 dammages per annum) are in&s;ufferable by Engli&s;h &s;pirits; and plea&s;e you to give credence that to all the&s;e they pretend your name and affirme that they dare not (for offending you) agree with us, nor come to rules of righteous neighbour|hood, only they know you favour us not and therefore &s;end us for redre&s;&s;e unto you.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Concerning four Engli&s;h families at Paw|tuxet, may it plea&s;e you to remember that two controver&s;ies they have long (under your name) maintained with us, to a con&s;tant ob&s;tructing of all order and authoritie among&s;t us.</P>
<P>To our complaint about our lands they lately have pro|fe&s;t a willingnes to arbitrate, but to obey his highnes au|thoritie in this charter, they &s;ay, they dare not for your &s;akes, though they live not by your lawes, nor bear your common charges nor ours, but evade both under colour of your authoritie.</P>
<P>Honoured Sirs, I cordially pro&s;e&s;&s;e it before the mo&s;t high, that I believe it, if not only they but our&s;elves and all the whole country, by joint con&s;ent, were &s;ubject to your government, it might be a rich mercy; but as things yet are, and &s;ince it plea&s;ed fir&s;t the parliament, and then the lord admirall and committee for foraigne plantations, and &s;ince the councell of &s;tate, and la&s;tly the lord pro|tector and his councell, to continue us as a di&s;tinct colonie, yea and &s;ince it hath plea&s;ed your&s;elves by publick letters and references to us from your publick courts to owne
<PB N="277" REF="011300_0141_0F86A070745B36A8">
the authoritie of his Highnes among&s;t us; be plea&s;ed to con&s;ider how un&s;uitable it is for your&s;elves (if the&s;e fami|lies at Pawtuxet plead truth) to be the ob&s;tructers of all orderly proceedings among&s;t us; for I humbly appeale to your owne wi&s;edomes and experience how unlikely it is for a people to be compelled to order and common charges, when others in their bo&s;oms are by &s;uch (&s;eeming) par|tialitie exempted from both.</P>
<P>And therefore (la&s;tly) be plea&s;ed to know, that there are (upon the point) but two families which are &s;o ob|&s;tructive and de&s;tructive to an equall proceeding of civill order among&s;t us; for one of the&s;e 4 families, Stephen Arnold, de&s;ires to be uniforme with us; a &s;econd Zacharie Rhodes, being in the way of dipping is (potentially) bani&s;h|ed by you. Only Wm. Arnold and Wm. Carpenter (very far all&s;o in religion from you, if you knew all) they have &s;ome coulour, yet in a late conference they all plead that all the ob&s;tacle is their offending of your&s;elves.</P>
<P>Fourthly, whereas (I humbly conceave) with the peo|ple of this colonie your commerce is as great as with any in the countrey, and our dangers (being a frontier people to the Barbarians) are greater than tho&s;e of other colonies, and the ill con&s;equences to your&s;elves would be not a few nor &s;mall, and to the whole land, were we fir&s;t ma&s;&s;acred or ma&s;tered by them. I pray your aequall and favourable reflection upon that your law which prohibits us to buy of you all meanes of our nece&s;&s;ary defence of our lives and families (yea in this mo&s;t bloudy and ma&s;&s;acring time.)</P>
<P>We are informed that tickets have rarely bene denied to any Engli&s;h of the country; yea the barbarians (tho' notorious in lyes) if they profe&s;&s;e &s;ubjection, they are fur|ni&s;hed: Only our&s;elves, by former and later denyall, &s;eem to be devoted to be the Indian &s;hambles and ma&s;&s;acres.</P>
<P>The barbarians all the land over are filled with artillerie and ammunition from the Dutch, openly and horridly, and from all the Engli&s;h over the country (by &s;tealth) I know they abound &s;o wonderfully, that their activitie and in&s;olencie is grown &s;o high, that they dayly con&s;ult and
<PB N="278" REF="011300_0142_0F86A0720953E0E0">
hope and threaten to render us &s;laves, as they long &s;ince (and now mo&s;t horribly) have made the Dutch.</P>
<P>For my&s;elfe (as through Gods goodne&s;s) I have refu&s;ed the gaine of thou&s;ands by &s;uch a murtherous trade, and think no law yet extant among&s;t your&s;elves or us &s;ecure enough again&s;t &s;uch a villainie; &s;o am I loath to &s;ee &s;o many hundreds (if not &s;ome thou&s;ands) in this colonie de&s;troyed like fools and bea&s;ts without re&s;i&s;tance: I grieve that &s;o much bloud &s;hould cry again&s;t your&s;elves, yea and I grieve that (at this in&s;tant by the&s;e &s;hips) this cry and the premi&s;&s;es &s;hould now trouble his highnes and his councell.

<P>Your wi&s;edomes know the inhumane in&s;ultations of the&s;e wild creatures, and you may be plea&s;ed al&s;o to ima|gine, that they have not bene &s;paring of your name as the patron of all their wickednes again&s;t our Engli&s;h men, women and children, and cattle to the yearely dammage of 60, 80 and 100<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P>The remedie is (under God) only your plea&s;ure that Pumham &s;hall come to an agreement with the towne or colonie, and that &s;ome convenient way and time be &s;et for their removall.</P>
<P>And that your wi&s;domes may &s;ee ju&s;t grounds for &s;uch your willingne&s;s, be plea&s;ed to be informed of a realitie of a &s;olemne covenant betweene this town of Warwick and Pumham, unto which, notwith&s;tanding that he pleads his being drawne to it by the awe of his &s;uperiour Sachims, yet I humbly offer that what was done was according to the law and tenour of the natives (I take it) in all New England and America, viz. that the inferiour Sachims and &s;ubjects &s;hall plant and remove at the plea&s;ure of the highe&s;t and &s;upreme Sachims, and I humbly conceave that it plea&s;eth the Mo&s;t High and only Wi&s;e to make u&s;e of &s;uch a bond of authoritie over them, without which they could not long &s;ub&s;i&s;t in humane &s;ocieties, in this wild condition wherein they are.</P>
<P N="2">2. Plea&s;e you not to be in&s;en&s;ible of the &s;lipperie and dangerous condition of this their intermingled cohabita|tion.
<PB N="280" REF="011300_0143_0F86A073348991D8">
I am humbly confident, that all the Engli&s;h towns and plantations in all New-England put together &s;uffer not &s;uch mole&s;tation from the natives as this one towne and people. It is &s;o great and &s;o oppre&s;&s;ive that I have dayly feared the tidings of &s;ome publicke fire and mi&s;chief.</P>
<P N="3">3. Be plea&s;ed to review this copie from the lord admi|rall and that this Engli&s;h towne of Warwick &s;hould pro|ceede, al&s;o that if any of yours were there planted they &s;hould by your authoritie be removed. And we humbly conceave that if the Engli&s;h (who&s;e removes are difficult and chargeable) how much more the&s;e wild ones, who re|move with little more trouble and dammage then the wild bea&s;ts of the wildernes.</P>
<P N="4">4. Plea&s;e you to be informed that this &s;mall neck (wherein they keepe and mingle fields with the Engli&s;h) is a very den of wickednes, where they not only practice the horrid barbari&s;ms of all kind of whoredoms, idolatries and conjurations but living without all exerci&s;e of actual authoritie, and getting &s;tore of liquors (to our griefe) there is a confidence and rendezvous of all the wilde&s;t and mo&s;t licentious natives and practices of the whole country.</P>
<P N="5">5. Be&s;ide &s;atisfaction to Pumham and the former inha|bitants of this neck, there is a competitour who mu&s;t all&s;o be &s;atisfied, another Sachim, one Nawwu&s;haw&s;uck, who (living with Ou&s;amaquin) layes claime to this place, and are at dayly fewd with Pumham (to my knowledge) about the title and lord&s;hip of it. Ho&s;tilitie is daily threatned.</P>
<P>Our &s;econd reque&s;t concerns 2 or 3 Engli&s;h families at Pawtuxet who, before our charter, &s;ubjected them&s;elves unto your juri&s;diction. It is true, there are many grie|vances betweene many of the town of Providence and them, and the&s;e I humbly conceave may be&s;t he ordered to be compo&s;ed by reference.</P>
<P>But (2) we have formerly made our addre&s;&s;es and now doe for your prudent removall of this great and long ob&s;truction to all due order and regular proceedings among us, viz. the refu&s;all of the&s;e families (pretending your name) to conforme with us unto his Highnes authoritie among&s;t us.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="281" REF="011300_0143_0F86A073348991D8">3. Your wi&s;edomes experimentally know how apt men are to &s;tumble at &s;uch an exemption from all duties and &s;ervices from all rates and charges either with your&s;elves or us.</P>

<P>Our third reque&s;t is for your favourable leave to us to buy of your merchants fower or more barrells of powder yearely, with &s;ome convenient proportion of artillerie, con|&s;idering our hazardous frontier &s;ituation to the&s;e Barbari|ans, who from their abundant &s;upply of armes from the Dutch (and per&s;idious Engli&s;h all the land over) are full of our artillerie, which hath rendered them exceedingly in&s;olent, provoking and threatning, e&s;pecially the inlanders which have their &s;upply from the fort of Aurania. We have bene e&s;teemed by &s;ome of you as your thornie hedge on this &s;ide of you; If &s;o, yet an hedge to be maintained: If as out &s;entinells, yet not to be di&s;couraged.

<P>For the obtaining of the&s;e our ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary peti|tions we have no inducement or hope from our&s;elves; only we pray you to remember that the matters prayed are no way di&s;honourable to your&s;elves and we humbly conceave doe greatly promote the honour and plea&s;ure of his Highnes, yea of the Mo&s;t High all&s;o, and la&s;tly, &s;uch

<P>THE remembrance of the &s;olemne covenants and pro|mi&s;es the united colonies (in the beginning of their combination) made one with another, not only to &s;trengthen the hearts and hands each of other in appointing and maintaineing of religion in its purity, but al&s;o to be a&s;&s;i&s;t|ing each to other where any deficiency in &s;uch re&s;pects may appear, hath putt us upon the pur&s;uance of our en|deavours to di&s;charge our duties in de&s;ireing you to con&s;i|der of &s;ome &s;uch meete way and expedient, as where any defect appeares in any colony in the right improvement of &s;uch meanes and ordinances as the Lord hath appointed all his to u&s;e and improve for the edification of the body whereof Chri&s;t is the head, till his &s;econd coming.</P>

<P N="1">1. Fir&s;t, wee cannot (without breach of charitie) but take it for a thing graunted generally by the inhabitants of the united colonies, that an able orthodox mini&s;try is a precious fruite of Chri&s;t's death, re&s;urrection and a&s;cen|tion, and nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;piritual good of his people, and to be duely &s;ought after in every &s;ociety or town&s;hip within the &s;everal juri&s;dictions.</P>
<P N="2">2. And &s;econdly, that a competent maintenance propor|tionable to the abilitie of the place and nece&s;&s;itie of the mini&s;ter is a debt of ju&s;tice not charitie.</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence thirdly, the mini&s;ter may ju&s;tly expect it from that &s;ocietie and town&s;hip wherein he labours.</P>
<P N="4">4. The reference or relation of a mini&s;ter being to the whole &s;ocietie joyntly, whether in church order or not, his expectation of maintenance, and the debt of ju&s;tice, is from the whole &s;ocietie joyntly.</P>
<P N="5">5. Although the &s;ocietie may according to their di&s;|cretion u&s;e divers wayes to rai&s;e this maintainance, yet if the wayes be ineffectual (though the defect may be in &s;ome particular per&s;ons) the &s;ocietie cannot be di&s;charged, but is the debtor.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="286" REF="011300_0146_0F86A076951779A0">6. The ingagement being upon the &s;ocietie, and that according to religion and right rea&s;on, it nece&s;&s;arily follows that the &s;ociety be enabled with &s;ufficient power to di&s;|charge it &s;elfe.</P>
<P N="7">7. Therefore the generall court &s;hould declare &s;uch a power to be in &s;uch &s;ocieties, that there may be no pre|tence in them for want thereof, and if any &s;ocietie or town&s;hip &s;hall be wanting, either out of neglect or opinion, to procure and maintaine as above&s;aid an orthodoxe mini|&s;try according to the go&s;pell, wee conceive (by the rules of &s;cripture and the practi&s;e not only of all chri&s;tian go|vernments but even of heathen who not only held their &s;acra in veneration but tooke care of tho&s;e that had the keeping of them and the charge of making knowne their mi&s;teries) the &s;everall generall courts &s;tand charged with the care that the people profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tianitie owne and live according to rules and ordinances of their profe&s;&s;ion, and that the di&s;pen&s;ers of them be incouraged as afore&s;aid. The maintenance of the mini&s;try being a debt of ju&s;tice from the &s;ocietie and the &s;ocietie impowered to di&s;charge it, if any particular per&s;on &s;hall be defective to the &s;ocietie they ought to be ordered by the ordinary cour&s;e of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The&s;e generalls wee thought meete to propo&s;e, from whence wee leave to the wi&s;dome of the generall court to draw up &s;uch conclu&s;ions and orders as may attaine the end de&s;ired. And if any of the members of the &s;aid court &s;hould not concur (at pre&s;ent) with our apprehen&s;ions, wee doe earne&s;tly de&s;ire that by all meanes they would labour to informe and &s;atisfy them&s;elves of the trueth of the particulars above&s;aid, whereof wee (for our parts) have noe doubt. Wee doe further propo&s;e to the &s;everall ge|nerall courts that all Quakers, Ranters, and other notori|ous heretickes be prohibited comeing into the united co|lonies and if any &s;hall hereafter come or arri&s;e among&s;t us, that they be forthwith &s;ecured or removed out of all the juri&s;dictions.

<P>Fir&s;t, This may be given as a rea&s;on, that it is again&s;t a fundamentall law in nature to be compelled to pay that which others doe give. For then no man hath any cer|taynty or right to what he hath, if it be in the power of others (by pretence of authority or without) to give it away (when in their prudence they conceive it to be for the benefit of the owner) without his owne con&s;ent.</P>
<P>Secondly, This to me is &s;ome &s;trengthning to induce my apprehen&s;ion in this ca&s;e, viz. That notwith&s;tanding in England, it cannot be denied, but that mens e&s;tates were &s;ometymes unduly taken from them: Some by force, &s;ome by fraud, &s;ome by &s;ini&s;ter wre&s;ting of evidences, yea, and &s;ometimes of lawe it&s;elfe, as about knighthood-money, &s;hipmoney, &amp;c. yet I dare &s;ay, if &s;earch be made into hi&s;tories, lawyers bookes of reports, &amp;c. it cannot be made to appeare that in the mo&s;t exorbitant times any man hath had his e&s;tate taken from him as by the guift of others, under colour of lawe, or countenance of authority. Noe, noe, lawyers would have blu&s;hed to have given &s;uch a con|&s;truction of lawes; and &s;uddenly their faces would have waxed pale. For the Kinge would have beene too wi&s;e to have owned the plea. And what would all wi&s;e men have &s;aid for &s;uch taking away the greate&s;t outward right or liberty from them? For it may be under&s;tood, that bene|volencies, incouraging gratuities, leaves, or privy &s;eales, were not required by lawe, or by pretence of lawe, but de|&s;ired as by favour. However they were obtained by ille|gall and tyrannicall meanes, as was apprehended.</P>
<P>This I &s;ay further, and I doe argue it from the greater to the le&s;&s;e. That if noe kinge or parliament can ju&s;tly enact and cau&s;e that one mans e&s;tate, in whole or in part, may be taken from him and given to another without his owne con&s;ent, then &s;urely the major part of a towne or other inferior powers cannot doe it. But &s;hew us any man that can produce any foot&s;tep for &s;uch a way, either directly or indirectly.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="011300_0148_0F86A0781D26C4C0">But to the contrary it appeareth unto me. See Dalton page 401. where it is to this effect. That the kinge can|not relea&s;e a man out of pri&s;on (being in at a private mans &s;uit) to his damage, without his owne con&s;ent. Al&s;o to the &s;ame purpo&s;e &s;ee Sir Henry Finch, recorder of London, in his fir&s;t booke of lawe, page 74, having ended his rules about native or fundamentall lawes, he &s;aith in the next page, Therefore lawes po&s;itive doe lo&s;e their force and are noe lawes at all, which are directly contrary to the former viz. native or fundamentall.</P>
<P>The parliament may tax (and that ju&s;tly) the whole country to give a guift or reward to one man for &s;ome &s;er|vice; for they are betru&s;ted &s;oe to doe. The rea&s;on is, it is levied upon the whole country, with their con&s;ent, and for the immediate benefitt of the whole.</P>
<P>But if they &s;hould doe it between per&s;ons (though they &s;hould &s;oe doe by power, and the per&s;on wronged hath noe remedy in this world) yet it would be accounted ty|ranny. Is it not to take from Peter and give it to Paul?</P>
<P>If one man, for &s;uch or &s;uch a turne or good end, may ju&s;tly be deprived of a fundamentall right or liberty, then an other and an other, and &s;o every man. In England there is but one &s;ort of men that might be deprived of their goods; which &s;ort are u&s;ually called &s;laves but there they are called villeynes to the lord of the mannor.</P>
<P>Thus much concerning fundamentall lawe, in reference to mine and thine, not to be given or taken away without his owne con&s;ent.</P>
<P>But now to an&s;wer &s;ome objections that may be made to the ca&s;e in hande.</P>
<P>Objection. Suppo&s;e it be true what is expre&s;&s;ed, and granted that he were a &s;trange man that &s;hould deny the &s;ame in the generall: Yet, notwith&s;tanding, it hindereth not but that a towne (when and as often as they thinke good, in their prudence) may doe it for good ends, and &s;oe (in &s;peciall ca&s;es) it may lawfully be done in the particular, upon the lawe made page the 9th, <HI>that every inhabitant

&s;hall contribute to all charges in church and commonwealth (whereof he doth or may receive a benefitt) el&s;e he &s;hall be &s;trayned.</HI></P>
<P>An&s;wer. I conceive that it is an extreame di&s;honour ca&s;t upon the generall court, to make &s;uch a con&s;truction of their po&s;itive laws as doth infringe the fundamentall law of mine and thine; for it mu&s;t needs be voyd, if it &s;hould indeed be nece&s;&s;aryly con&s;trued again&s;t the right or liberty of the &s;ubject. But the law in its true &s;en&s;e is good.</P>
<P>Before this recited law was made, though &s;ome churches, or townes rather, did agree how much yearely maintenance the mini&s;ter &s;hould have, yet it was not rated, at lea&s;t in any compellable way by the towne, but men did pay their proportion in a way of voluntary contribution. But &s;ome (e&s;pecially non members) &s;ome of them did grow &s;lacke; and &s;o the burthen grew too hevy upon church members, &amp;c. And upon con&s;ideration it was found lawfull to make a law to compell every one to beare his owne &s;hare; for|a&s;much as by hearing the word and publique prayer, &amp;c. he did or might receive a benefitt and (in a way of God) be received as a member with the re&s;t. And yet the law was framed &s;oe, as &s;uch churches as cho&s;e to goe in a volun|tary way of weekly contribution or &s;oe, might &s;oe conti|nue, notwith&s;tanding this law, as &s;ome churches in this country doe to this day.</P>
<P>But for the right under&s;tanding of the word <HI>benefitt</HI> in the law, it is worthy the con&s;ideration or attendance, that benefit and nece&s;&s;ary duty mu&s;t goe together. The law both of God and the country doth require people to goe to the meeting for publique wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>But it is not under&s;tood that any law doth provide that every towne &s;hall buy or build a hou&s;e for the mini&s;ter as often as there is a removall by death or otherwi&s;e, I mean to be his in propriety.</P>
<P>Let us a little examine the poynt of <HI>benefitt</HI> that a man doth or may receive, as a motive to &s;uch a gift.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="011300_0149_0F86A0794DCA22D8">Fir&s;t, &s;uppo&s;e or admitt the giver (compelled by the act of others again&s;t his will) &s;hould gaine twenty fold there|by, viz. by the u&s;e of &s;uch a &s;mith, or per&s;on obtained into towne, yet that doth nothing at all warrant the act.</P>
<P>And if you &s;hould onely con&s;ider matter of <HI>benefitt</HI> (not at all in this con&s;ideration minding the poynt of law|fullne&s;&s;e or unlawfullne&s;&s;e in being compelled to pay) though it be not material to the ca&s;e (as hath been &s;ayd) whether it be <HI>benefitt</HI> or not in this re&s;pect, yet then the other way voted by the towne, viz. for the mini&s;try, accor|ding to the law provided, (by &s;o generall if not univer&s;all con&s;ent) is to be compared with this way now &s;trayned for, to under&s;tand which way turnes the &s;cale for matter of <HI>benefitt.</HI></P>
<P>He that layeth downe a &s;umm of money in hand for worke to be done, gives ju&s;t occa&s;ion for others to take into the con&s;ideration whether a mans life be &s;oe certayne or his continuance in the place and worke is made &s;o &s;ure as that it is a <HI>benefitt</HI> to goe in that way rather than in the other: For in any matter of this kind, rightly to under&s;tand whether &s;oe or &s;oe be a <HI>benefitt,</HI> yea or noe, both the pre&s;ent and future arguments mu&s;t be weighed together.</P>

<P>An&s;. It is fully granted in one &s;en&s;e, but not in the &s;en&s;e of our enquiry. Here externall <HI>benefitt</HI> (in the compari&s;on) is the thing con&s;iderable, as that the labourer is worthy of his hire.</P>
<P>For if the objecter &s;hould have men otherwi&s;e to under|&s;tand the matter of <HI>benefitt,</HI> he mu&s;t alter his mind upon this con&s;ideration: Whoever doth but ride through the towne, and the people being met at that tyme, the &s;tranger comes in and &s;peaks &s;ome heavenly truths among&s;t them: Is not this of greater value than all the lands, hou&s;es and cattle in the towne?

<HEAD>About a bargain or contract.</HEAD>
<P>Obj. Suppo&s;e it &s;hould be endeavoured to be made a bargain, &amp;c.</P>
<P>An&s;. It is no matter to the ca&s;e in que&s;tion: For though it be in the power of a per&s;on or of many (each per&s;on con|&s;enting) to make a bargain never &s;o much to his owne lo&s;&s;e, yet he or they mu&s;t be holden to it: But otherwi&s;e it is with a derived power or tru&s;t, being a &s;ociety; for they have not &s;uch an unlimited domination over other mens e&s;tates or per&s;ons; For, &s;etting a&s;ide the con&s;ideration of the fundamentall law (before &s;ufficiently &s;poken unto) they are limited by &s;tatute law. And &s;uch bargains as bind the non con&s;enters mu&s;t be ju&s;t, rationall, and the termes or conditions al&s;o expre&s;&s;ed and certayne: If any of the&s;e fayle noe law will bind them.</P>
<P>This is knowne, that upon motions in towne meetings and other companies, &s;ome u&s;e one argument or motive, &s;ome another. Some are moved with one argument or con&s;ideration in his mind, &s;ome with another. And is the rule to &s;eeke then (or onely &s;oe in this ca&s;e) what is the way of nations to under&s;tand the mind of the company? Mu&s;t not recour&s;e be had to the record?</P>
<P>In the ca&s;e in que&s;tion, doe the agitations end in a bar|gain, or in a gift? Whatever the motives were that did incline, &amp;c. if &s;o expre&s;&s;ed in termes, it is hard worke to add thereunto or to alter therefrom.</P>
<P>If it were &s;o, that any man were not capable to receive a gift, it might have &s;ome colour to be interpreted to be a bargain, or contract.</P>
<P>But if it be an equall or rationall thing to have pay laid downe, or urged to be laid downe afore-hand, where a call of God is acknowledged by accepting and taking office before. And be&s;ides the knowledge of the yearely &s;alary. knowing al&s;o that the place was willing to expend 150 <HI>l.</HI> to buy or build a hou&s;e for the u&s;e of the mini&s;try, which during his abode there he was to dwell in.</P>
<P>And when there are noe certayne conditions that doe provide, in ca&s;e he die or remoove within one yeare, or

one month, his executor to returne part of it to the towne, or when there is no &s;uch conditions, nor any at all expre&s;&s;|ed, and onely one party knowne to con&s;ent, and that as they have done, whether this can be called a ju&s;t and binding contract or bargain, yea or noe, or any at all, let the world judge.</P>
<P>And certayne &s;uch as plead on the now defendants party mu&s;t &s;ay it is either a gift or a bargain. If this be endea|voured to be a bargain or contract, it is a very blind bar|gain, as they &s;ay, which (acting upon oath) I could not allow. If a gift (for there may be motives and high con|&s;iderations in the minds of the granters to give as well as to conclude a bargain) then it doth not bind &s;uch as doe not con&s;ent to be forced to pay what doe move other men to give away out of their e&s;tates.</P>

<P>Let us not (here in New-England) de&s;pi&s;e the rules of the learned in the lawes of England, who have both great helps and long experience.</P>
<P N="1">1. Fir&s;t rule is, that where a law is &s;uch as that, by wre&s;ting, a man may give &s;uch an interpretation as will overthrow it, when it might be con&s;trued to be good; this is a corrupt interpretation. So holy &s;cripture may be wre&s;ted.</P>

<P N="2">2. Another rule is about equality. Hence where a com|pany in tru&s;t doth act, if any will imply conditions (noe way expre&s;t) yet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">F. p. 20.</NOTE> to hold forth any color of binding, they mu&s;t be knowne to be equall and certaine: though a &s;tatute law &s;hould provide or expre&s;&s;e mi&s;chief|ou&s;ly. See his words at large, ju&s;tly applyable as is expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="297" REF="011300_0151_0F86CB2DD907BED0">3. Another rule appeareth to this effect. That where a per&s;on is &s;ued at a private mans &s;uit, and put in pri&s;on upon execution,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dalton p. 401.</NOTE> the king cannot pardon that impri&s;onment without the con&s;ent of the party plt. and the rea&s;on is there given; for it is in lieu of damage to the party, as hath been touched before.</P>

<P>So far touching rules for interpretation of laws.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. By the way: Seeing there is &s;o much &s;poken about fundamentall lawes and interpretations, what may be the difference betweene the late Earle of Straffords inter|pretations and actings again&s;t fundamentall lawes, and &s;ome|times tho&s;e of other men?</P>
<P>An&s;w. Although in &s;ome things materially they &s;hould be the &s;ame, yet formally they are not, or may not be &s;o.</P>
<P>The Earle of Straffords acting was found to be a trea|cherous and perfidious attempt to alter and &s;ubvert the frame of polity.</P>
<P>So there were the&s;e particulars in it, viz. Fir&s;t, his end was naughr. 2dly, He acted arbitrarily again&s;t &s;uch lawes. 3dly, It was done perfidiou&s;ly, it being done willingly.</P>
<P>But others acting again&s;t fundamentall law, charity con|&s;trueth that their end they ayme at is good. Secondly, their arbitrary con&s;truction (where it is &s;o) may be through ignorance, or through want of notice taking of &s;uch rules for interpretation of laws as are expre&s;&s;ed in the lawyers bookes.</P>

<P>But the re&s;ult of all motions and arguments was to give 100<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> as it is expre&s;&s;ed in the record. From which I dare not in any wi&s;e in point of ju&s;tice receed.</P>
<P>Obj. La&s;tly, if it be objected that in that there was &s;oe great a &s;ume given or granted it may &s;tumble the bu&s;ines, but had there beene a matter of half of it or le&s;&s;e it would have been held good.</P>
<P>An&s;. However too often it falls out in the world that &s;maller injuries or errors are pa&s;&s;ed by, being done by the hands of &s;uch as have power in their hands and &s;pecially if acted by &s;uch as are in &s;upreme authority, yet &s;uch act|ings were but a crooked or le&s;bian rule to ju&s;tify an act thereby. Will it not be yeelded that <HI>majus &amp; minus non variant &s;peciem?</HI> If the major part can ju&s;tly give away one pound, by the &s;ame rea&s;on 100<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> yea 1000<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> If one acre of another mans ground, his orchard al&s;o, yea his farme as well. And that although a parliament or generall court cannot doe it.</P>
<P>Such as promi&s;&s;e a guift it behoves them in poynt of con&s;cience to make payment (and they only it is conceived) though not as vote of the towne, but as each particular mans promi&s;&s;e doth binde him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. If it be demanded whether there be any diffe|rence detweene di&s;po&s;ing mens e&s;tates by way of guift (under colour of law and countenance of authority) unto other men again&s;t or without the con&s;ent of the owners and the doctrine of levelli&s;me.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="011300_0153_0F86CB2ED5383C58">An&s;. It may be an&s;wered (I conceive) to this effect, viz. That of the levellers, though wicked and ab&s;urd, yet it is as yet but doctrinall (I thinke) but this kinde of tran&s;po&s;e|ing mens e&s;tates is both doctrinall and practicall al&s;oe, and &s;oe leadeth more directly to tiranny as it &s;eemeth.</P>
<P>Secondly, Levelli&s;me (I take it) reacheth but to the e&s;tate, &amp;c. But this (if accounted legall) men may for a debt &s;oe obtained (as in other ca&s;es) upon execution for a debt inforce the per&s;on to pri&s;on, or expo&s;e him to be &s;ould to make payment.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. But what if there be an interpretation put upon the words of the records, and call it a contract, will not this help the matter.</P>
<P>An&s;. This liberty to interprett acts or records again&s;t the playne words thereof (if it be a help) I &s;uppo&s;e it is to make the matter wor&s;e in this re&s;pect (if wor&s;e can be) then the doctrine of levelli&s;me, for by their doctrine (I thinke) a man may under&s;tand what they meane by their words, and their words are u&s;ed (its likely) in one fence.</P>
<P>But this kinde of liberty of interpreting &s;eems to coun|tenance and &s;trengthen the opinion of the &s;cepticks, which makes all things true, and &s;oe indeed nothing true or cer|tayne. Hence when an act will &s;erve the turne let the words &s;tand, el&s;e take liberty to interpret them for their purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>If this kind of liberty be good, either to con&s;true laws (provided for nece&s;&s;ary payments) or turning guifts into contracts (as men plea&s;e) then indeed it is all one whether both parties be pre&s;ent when the bu&s;ines is in hand or not. And though it was wont to be lawe that a bargain, whether it proveth gaynfull or loo&s;ing, yet being made bindeth both parties. But had this vote beene for 20<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> M (or &s;oe) in&s;tead of 100<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> would it be interpreted good, binding and di&s;anulling of the vote for the 150<ABBR><HI>l</HI></ABBR>? But this was intended doubtle&s;s by &s;ome, namely by granting a new &s;ume to change or repeale the act for the former way agreed on, according to the lawe and the townes con|tentment, though herein al&s;oe they did mi&s;take, for there
<PB N="302" REF="011300_0154_0F86CB2FD76526A8">
appeareth to be noe vote to di&s;anull the former. Soe that if there were divers more graunts or gifts in this kind, they were all additionall, and would all be gotten by &s;uit and di&s;tre&s;&s;e, and if this may, ju&s;tly be obtained by lawe.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion unto this court is annexed under the hand of the clerk of Salem court.</P>
<P>It being framed in one que&s;tion by Salem court, it doth con&s;i&s;t of a compound axiome.</P>
<P>Upon viewing whereof I finde the paper to contayne two que&s;tions di&s;tinctly taken.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Fir&s;t, Whether the vote doth binde all or any of the inhabitants of the &s;aid towne to pay any thinge towards the &s;aid 100 <HI>l.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Secondly, Whether &s;uch as voted not but are and were unwilling may be compelled thereunto, yea or noe?</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e doth not concerne &s;uch as refu&s;e to pay or are defendants in the ca&s;e originally: Save that they are bound to de&s;ire that matters may be rightly under&s;tood and judged. Not doubting but the court &s;eeth a manife&s;t difference betweene a mans being bound in private con|&s;cience to performe his owne promi&s;&s;e, and being legally bound by a vote of a towne. For a towne or court cannot or need not di&s;tingui&s;h of particular per&s;ons who is for the affirmative, who not. But how many, &amp;c. Its the vali|dity of a major part's vote is in que&s;tion; not the per&s;onall vote of this man or of that.</P>
<P>The latter doth properly concerne the &s;aid defendants. For payment whereunto, or accordingly, they are &s;ued and their goods di&s;treyned. And the ca&s;e is now come to this court for re&s;olution.</P>
<P>The order of the towne of Ip&s;wich, its proceeding in re|ference to the an&s;wers in que&s;tion was to this effect, viz.</P>
<P>At a meeting in Ip&s;wich October 55, about the tyme of Mr. Cobbetts coming to towne, there was a vote pa&s;t to pay 80<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> per ann. for his maintenance.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="011300_0154_0F86CB2FD76526A8">Al&s;oe there was another vote of the towne expre&s;&s;ing their willingnes to di&s;bur&s;e a &s;ume not exceeding 150<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> to provide for the mini&s;try.</P>
<P>And there was a meeting of the towne in February following (being about &s;ix weekes after Mr. Cobbett was ordayned) upon much agitation to and fro there was a vote pa&s;t in the&s;e words, viz. Voted by the towne to give 100<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> to buy or build a hou&s;e for Mr. Cobbett.</P>
<P>It is conceived that the view hereof doth afford argu|ment for further clearing and confirming (if need were) of what is argued for in this paper.</P>
<P>To conclude this matter, I thank God, I am for ordi|nances both in church and common wealth; and con&s;e|quently for due meanes for the upholding of them (and doe account it not onely a great wickednes to be contrary-minded, but extreme folly and madnes) and I thinke it tends to the honour of them, when, in reference there|unto, provi&s;ion is made either in a voluntary or el&s;e in a way of compul&s;ion, grounded upon &s;uch principles as both here and in other nations will be owned as ju&s;t and equall.</P>
<P>I doe &s;ometymes remember what is &s;aid of Levy. In poynt of right and truth, he tooke noe notice of father or mother. And that is the way to e&s;tabli&s;h love and peace in this our I&s;rael. And the holy &s;cripture doth oblige the doctrine and practice of piety according to the fir&s;t table, and of di&s;tributive ju&s;tice in the &s;econd, both expre&s;sly, or by nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, at the hands of &s;uch as are called to di&s;pence the &s;ame, though they take not oath &s;oe to doe.</P>
<P>It is &s;uppo&s;ed that noe man is come to New England to have his goods given and taken from him, unto, or for what good end, or under what pretence &s;oever.</P>
<P>If this &s;hould be confirmed for good law; henceforth then (I conceive) there will be noe more need, or little, to make any more propo&s;itions for voluntary contri|butions.</P>

<P>WHEREAS it hath plea&s;ed God in the way of his providence to exerci&s;e the towne of Ip&s;wich with great troubles, by removing tho&s;e reverend elders which they formerly enjoyed, it plea&s;ed God in our &s;traits by the help of our honoured Governor, Deputy Governor and &s;everall of the reverend Elders, to provide for us an able helpe in the worke of the Lord among us, our rev. pa&s;tour Mr. Th. Cobbet, whom now at pre&s;ent we enjoy. After he was come among&s;t us, we came in a church-meeting to con&s;ider how to provide for his maintenance, in which we conceive a hou&s;e mu&s;t be provided for him. Then the ca&s;e came to be propounded to the towne in a generall towne-meeting, where being &s;ome agitations about it, there pa&s;&s;ed a vote, which is here expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<Q>Voted to give 100<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> towards the building or buying a hou&s;e for Mr. Cobbet.</Q>

came to con&s;ider with the &s;electmen what to do about it, and they ordered the mar&s;hall to di&s;treine one, or two. He was &s;ued in an action of tre&s;pa&s;&s;e before our honoured magi&s;trate Mr. Samuel Symonds, from who&s;e judgment he appealed to Salem court; where the partyes appearing, were de&s;ired by the court to cea&s;e pro&s;ecution and to let the que&s;tion be &s;tated by the court and pre&s;ented to the generall court. Which was accordingly con&s;ented unto. Which we humbly intreat this honoured court to take into their con&s;ideration.</P>

<HEAD>A copy of the order of Salem court.</HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS there were &s;everall actions commenced at this court by &s;ome of the inhabitants of Ip&s;wich, which were of great and generall concernment. And the court fearing the u&s;uall manner of proceedings would not put a comfortable i&s;&s;ue to the &s;aid ca&s;es, propounded to the partyes that the que&s;tion in controver&s;y might be &s;tated and pre&s;ented to the generall court for re&s;olution, which &s;hould determine the particular actions and all others that might ari&s;e upon the &s;aid que&s;tion, which que&s;tion was by the court &s;tated with the con&s;ent of partyes, and is as followeth.</P>
<Q>At a generall yearely meeting of the inhabitants of the towne of Ip&s;wich Feb. 25. 55. voted to give 100<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> toward building or buying a hou&s;e for Mr. Cobbet.</Q>
<P>The que&s;tion is, Whether this vote doth bind all or any of the inhabitants of the &s;aid towne to pay any thing to|ward the &s;aid 100<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> and that &s;uch as are or were unwilling may be compelled thereunto, yea or no? And it is agreed that either party &s;hall have liberty to pre&s;ent their rea&s;ons, in writing, to the generall court, pro and con. But no other pleadings by either party to be allowed.</P>
<P>According to which liberty we pre&s;ent as followeth.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion hath two parts, 1. Whether the vote be binding. 2. Whether &s;uch as refu&s;e may be compelled.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t being proved, the other will ea&s;ily follow.</P>
<DIV4 TYPE="reasons">
<PB N="306" REF="011300_0156_0F86CB3102A7DEE0">
<HEAD>Rea&s;ons tending to prove the affirmative.</HEAD>
<P>The vote is legall, therefore binding. It is legall in re&s;pect of the matter and manner. For the matter, it is nece&s;&s;ary, publicke towne charges, viz. honourable main|tenance of the mini&s;try, which the law requires in generall, but leaves to each towne to determine and apply in parti|cular, &s;uitable to their owne condition; provided they are &s;ubject to be regulated by higher authority, where need &s;hall require. This honourable maintenance, we conceive, cannot be le&s;&s;e than that a mini&s;ter, for his labour in preach|ing the go&s;pell, (whatever e&s;tate he hath of his owne) &s;hould have &s;uch a recompence whereby he may be enabled comfortably to provide for the pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity of his family, to be given to ho&s;pitality, and to leave &s;ome com|fortable provi&s;ion for his family after his decea&s;e, as other men by Gods ble&s;&s;ing upon their ordinary labours are generally enabled to doe. This being granted which (we hope) &s;eems but ju&s;t and rea&s;onable, that mini&s;ters families may not be left in a wor&s;e condition than mo&s;t other mens, the particular way and manner of affording this maintenance (where there are variety of apprehen&s;ions) mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be determined by the major part. So it was in our ca&s;e, and the towne pitched upon what is ex|pre&s;&s;ed in the vote, the due fullfilling of which is nece&s;&s;ary and ju&s;tifiable upon the&s;e grounds.</P>
<P N="1">1. The u&s;uall yearly allowance will not reach the for|mer end, viz. to afford any provi&s;ion for a mini&s;ters family after his death.</P>
<P N="2">2. This hath been a common practi&s;e among our&s;elves formerly, and in other places in the country le&s;&s;e able, not only to give their fir&s;t but &s;ucceeding mini&s;ters a dwelling hou&s;e, or &s;omewhat proportionable that way.</P>
<P N="3">3. This we perceived would be mo&s;t acceptable, and might rationally be expected, and the other way pro|pounded, of providing a hou&s;e meerely for u&s;e, would not be acceptable, as not being u&s;uall in the country, and apprehended prejudiciall to the familyes of mini&s;ters after their decea&s;e.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="307" REF="011300_0156_0F86CB3102A7DEE0">4. The &s;ume given is not &s;o great as to exceed the end for which it is granted, or to burden the towne in payment of it, and other le&s;&s;e &s;umes being propounded, this was freely cho&s;en and re&s;olved on.</P>
<P>This for the legality of the vote in re&s;pect of the mat|ter and &s;ub&s;tance of it.</P>
<P>For the manner. It was a lawful meeting, free liberty of debate being given, and at la&s;t concluded by the farre major part, very few oppo&s;ing it either in debate or voting.</P>
<P>Thus the vote appearing legall, we conceive it binding, and being &s;o, we conceive the towne hath power to com|pell &s;uch as refu&s;e to yield to it, by virtue of a law enact|ed and e&s;tabli&s;hed by the generall court, p. 9. providing that all common charges to church and commonwealth may be compelled by a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment and di&s;tre&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>To conclude, we hope and per&s;uade our&s;elves that our brethren are one with us in their love and de&s;ire to en|courage an able godly mini&s;try among us, and will judge it &s;afe&s;t and &s;uitable&s;t both to the mind of God and the godly zeale and religious care of our honoured generall court, to be open, rather then &s;trait-handed that way: And that we would not be ju&s;tly taxed for, nor exemplary in, the lea&s;t di&s;couragement of that nature, and that we agree in the end, only differ about the meanes of attain|ing it.</P>

<P>The humble petition of &s;everall the inhabitants of the townes of Yorke, Kittery, Wells, Saco and Cape Porpus, &s;ometymes under the provinciall government of Mayne and Lygonia, now under the juri&s;diction of the Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;ets in New England,</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<OPENER>Humbly &s;heweth,</OPENER>
<P>WHEREAS as information doth report unto us of &s;everal addre&s;&s;es lately made unto your Highnes, by &s;ome gentlemen of worth, for re&s;titution of their right of juri&s;diction over us, claimed by theyr patents, the de|termination whereof (we humbly conceive) after a legall hearing, re&s;ts upon your plea&s;ure, wherein our&s;elves not being &s;o properly concerned as others, at pre&s;ent, doe pur|po&s;ely wave, craving onely to pre&s;ent your Highnes with a true narrative, though implicite, of our fir&s;t and la&s;t e&s;tate, before and &s;ince we had this government which through Gods mercy we now enjoy to our good &s;atisfaction, and for our continued &s;etlednes under it we dayly pray, for the&s;e rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Becau&s;e of our&s;elves we have &s;mall power to carry on government, being a people but few in number, and tho&s;e not competent per&s;ons to manage &s;uch weighty affayres, our weakenes occa&s;ioning di&s;traction, our paucity divi&s;ion, our meanes contempt, as our owne former experi|ence hath fully evinced to the totall &s;ubverting all civill order among&s;t us.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, Becau&s;e chainges cannot reduce things from im|po&s;&s;ibilityes to make things, of &s;uch as are not, to be, the ca&s;e is ours, the places of our re&s;idence admit but of &s;mall

<P N="5">5thly, Changes are apt to inihilate, unle&s;s they prove much for the better, e&s;pecially in weake boddyes, where heades are far remote; touching &s;uch events our former experience hath taught us &s;omething, el&s;e we crave of tho&s;e gentlemen who are now &s;o &s;olicitous for government over us, what ment the deepne&s;s of theyr &s;ylence &s;everall yeares, both in theyr tongues and penns, as not after our frequen|cy of writing to them they not &s;o much as returne us one &s;ylable of an&s;wer, or afford us the lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance in go|vernment;

<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE have received your letter of October 58, with the petition of Mr. George Rigby, &amp;c. have con&s;idered the contents of both, and have herewith &s;ent you a copie of our patent, and of the extent of our lyne taken by ar|te&s;ts, with &s;everall other writings and letters to friends in reference thereunto, which we de&s;ire and hope may be improved to our advantage, and judge it convenient, if there be a fitt opportunitie and friends propitious for us, that it may be a &s;peedy i&s;&s;ue. Some con&s;iderations we thought good to &s;ugge&s;t, which you may make u&s;e of as there &s;hall be occa&s;ion; as fir&s;t, from the expre&s;&s;e words of the pattent that determines our northerly bounds, which our generall court hath always under&s;tood to meane as you know, as al&s;o one other pa&s;&s;age in the pattent where it is &s;aid that any thing of doubtfull interpretation &s;hall be under&s;tood in favour of the patentees. 2dly, At our fir&s;t coming hither into this wilderne&s;s, and for &s;ome yeares after, multitude of occa&s;ions in the beginning of &s;o great an undertaking did hinder our exact taking notice of our laying claim to the utmo&s;t extents of our limits, e&s;pecially to the norward, nor had we for &s;ome time after our com|ing hither occa&s;ion to make u&s;e thereof, yet did we never &s;ett up our bounds 3 myles ea&s;t of Merimack, as the peti|tion mentions, but as occa&s;ion was given have always a&s;|&s;erted the &s;ame limits that now we claim, though we knew not certainly (till tryall made) where it would fall. In the meane time, &s;everall per&s;ons procured pattents of certaine tracts of land within the limits formerly graunted us, all or mo&s;t whereof were obtained &s;urreptitiou&s;ly and illegally, and afterwards ordered and governed as unduely, the pattentees chiefly ayming at trade or private profitt, neglecting the chiefe end intended, and declared in his

Maje&s;ty's original graunt, whence it came to pa&s;&s;e that there were &s;everall pettie governments, &s;ometimes by pat|tent, &s;ometimes by combination, and &s;ometimes the people left in di&s;traction and confu&s;ion without any, and in great danger and hazard of &s;hedding one anothers blood, where|upon fir&s;t divers of the inhabitants of Pa&s;kataqua, about the year  <GAP DESC="blank">  petitioned this court that as they were conceived to be within our lyne, &s;o they might be actually taken in and governed by us, which accordingly was done by com|mi&s;&s;ions &s;ent from this court, with the con&s;ent and good liking of all the inhabitants and per&s;ons intere&s;ted therein, and &s;o have continued with much &s;atisfaction, living in peace and enjoying the fruit and benefitt of good government to this day. In the yeare  <GAP DESC="blank">  we took a more exact &s;urvey of our limits, and finding the&s;e ea&s;terly parts men|tioned in the petition to fall within our pattent (which is more ancient and more authenticke than any other pre|tended to by the petitioners) we made declaration thereof to the inhabitants re&s;iding within the afore&s;aid precincts, being likewi&s;e petitioned &s;o to doe by divers of the inha|bitants beyond Pa&s;kataqua river, now called York&s;hire, and after &s;ome agitation and conference with the re&s;t of the people there, we came to a friendly and amicable conclu|&s;ion, that as they were within our pattent &s;o they would forever be &s;ubject to this government, wherein they are well &s;atisfied and find the benefitt thereof, as theire peti|tion to his Highnes doth declare; nor was it matter of profitt that moved us hereunto, for we have neither re|ceived or expected any thereby, but the obligation of dutie that lay upon us to &s;ee the people within our pattent go|verned according to God, and hath been our diligent care and indeavour, and &s;o &s;hall allwayes be, that all ju&s;t po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions and improvements &s;hall be pre&s;erved and confirm|ed to the true proprietors there, as it is among&s;t the re&s;t of the inhabitants that have beene under our government from the beginning.

of your and the countryes concernes that neyther my&s;elfe nor any other for you can heare from you; the con&s;ide|ration whereof had almo&s;t wrought me to a re&s;olve of neglecting this opportunity of pre&s;enting my due re&s;pects in giveing you any account of others motions in England concerneing you; but lea&s;t you &s;hould have cau&s;e of chargeing me with neglect I have &s;et pen to paper, to let you under&s;tand what I heare in relation to New England. The complaynants again&s;t you to the Kings maje&s;ty, as I am informed, are Mr. Godfrey and that company, Mr. Reckes and Sefford and company of iron workes, &s;ome of the &s;ometymes fyned and impri&s;oned petitioners, whoe thought, fir&s;t, to have made theyr complaynts &s;everally, after, re&s;olved in joint by petition; moved to have the quakers and anabapti&s;ts joyned but they refu&s;ed. I have endea|voured to have a &s;ight of theyr petition but cannot pro|cure it; but am informed that, haveing mentioned the articles they petition for, the di&s;tance of place does not ad|mit of a way of heareing as being nigher it might. They move that a generall governour may be &s;ent to give reliefe to them. To this petition they get what hands they can of per&s;ons that have been in New England, though never inhabitants. The quakers I heare have been with the King concerneing your putting to death tho&s;e of theyr friends executed at Bo&s;ton. The generall vogue of peo|ple is that a governour will be &s;ent over. Other rumours there are concerneing you, but I omitt them, not knowing how to move and appeare at court on your behalfe, I made bold to addre&s;s my&s;elf to the Lord Say and de&s;yred his favour that in ca&s;e of complaynts to his maje&s;ty he would be your friend, &s;o far as to de&s;yre his maje&s;ty that you might be heard before any thing were determined concerneing you as to judgment. His lord&s;hip profe&s;&s;ed his greate re&s;pect for the plantations and thanked God he prayed for you dayly, promi&s;ing to improve his intere&s;t according to my motion. I likewi&s;e addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elfe to the Earle of Manche&s;ter, Lord Chamberlaine, who pro|mi&s;ed the like. By the &s;hips that are expected I perceive

that &s;ome of tho&s;e that complaine doe expect that you will impower &s;ome to appeare for you, and thereupon make &s;ome demurr in theyr pro&s;ecution, but if that be not, then they intend to have &s;omething done again&s;t the &s;pring of the yeare. The peace with Spayne was proclaimed in London 11th in&s;tant, upon the &s;ame articles concluded in his late maje&s;tyes tyme.

&s;cript, the tran&s;cript of our loyall hearts, into your royall hands, wherein we crave leave to &s;upplicate your Maje&s;ty for your gracious protection of us in the continuance both of our civill as of our religious liberties (according to the grantees known end of &s;uing for the pattent) conferred upon this plantation by your royall father. This, this, viz. our libertie to walke in the faith of the go&s;pell with all good con&s;cience, according to the order of the go&s;pell (unto which the former in the&s;e ends of the earth is but &s;ub&s;er|vient) was the cau&s;e of our tran&s;porting our&s;elves with our wives, little ones, and our &s;ub&s;tance, from that plea&s;ant land over the Atlantick ocean into the va&s;t wilderne&s;s, choo&s;ing rather the pure &s;cripture wor&s;hip with a good con&s;cience in this remote wilderne&s;s among the heathen, than the plea|&s;ures of England with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the impo&s;itions of the then &s;o di&s;po&s;ed and &s;o far prevailing hierarchy, which we could not doe without an evill con&s;cience. For this cau&s;e we are this day in a land which lately was not &s;owne, wherein we have conflicted with the &s;ufferings thereof much longer than Jacob was in Syria. Our witne&s;s is in heaven that we left not our native country upon any di&s;&s;a|tisfaction as to the con&s;titution of the civill &s;tate. Our lot, after the example of the good old nonconformi&s;ts, hath been only to act a pa&s;&s;ive part throughout the&s;e late vici&s;&s;i|tudes and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive overturnings of &s;tates. Our &s;epera|tion from our brethren in this de&s;art hath been and is a &s;ufficient bringing to mind the afflictions of Jo&s;eph: But providentiall exemption of us hereby from the late warres and temptations of either party we account as a favour from God; the former cloaths us with &s;ackcloth, the latter with innocency. What reception, courte&s;y and equanimity, tho&s;e greater, and others, adherers to the royall intere&s;t, who in their adver&s;e changes vi&s;ited the&s;e parts, were en|tertained with among&s;t us, according to the meane&s;s of our condition, we appeal to their own reports.</P>
<P>Touching complaints put in again&s;t us, our humble reque&s;t only is, that for the interim, while we are as dumb by rea&s;on of our ab&s;ence, your Maje&s;ty would permit no|thing

to make an impre&s;&s;ion on your royall heart again&s;t us, untill we have both opportunity and leave to an&s;wer for our&s;elves: Few will be innocent, &s;aid that impleader, if it be enough to deny: Few will be innocent, &s;aid the then Emperor, if it be enough to accu&s;e. Concerning the quakers, open and capitall bla&s;phemers, open &s;educers from the glorious Trinity, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the ble&s;&s;ed go&s;pell, and from the holy &s;criptures as the rule of life, open enemies to the government it&s;elfe as e&s;tabli&s;hed in the hands of any but men of their owne principles, malignant and a&s;&s;iduous promoters of doctrines directly tending to &s;ubvert both our church and &s;tate, after all other meanes for a long time u&s;ed in vaine, we were at la&s;t con&s;trained for our owne &s;afety to pa&s;&s;e a &s;en|tence of bani&s;hment again&s;t them, upon pain of death. Such was their dangerous and impetuous and de&s;perate turbulence both to religion and &s;tate civill and eccle&s;ia&s;ti|call, as that how unwillingly &s;oever (could it have been avoyded) the magi&s;trate at la&s;t, in con&s;cience both to God and man, judged him&s;elf called for the defence of all, to keep the pa&s;&s;age with the point of the &s;word held towards them, this could do no harm to him that would be warned thereby, their wittingly ru&s;hing them&s;elves thereupon was their owne act, we with all humility conceive a crime bring|ing their blood upon their owne head. The quakers died, not becau&s;e of their other crimes how capitall &s;oever, but upon their &s;uperadded pre&s;umptuous and incorrigible con|tempt of authority breaking in upon us, notwith&s;tanding their &s;entence of bani&s;hment made known to them; had they not been re&s;trained, &s;o far as appeared, there was too much cau&s;e to fear that we our&s;elves mu&s;t quickly have died or wor&s;e, and &s;uch was their in&s;olency that they would not be re&s;trained, but by death; nay, had they at la&s;t but promi&s;ed to depart the juri&s;diction, and not to re|turne without leave from authority, we &s;hould have been glad of &s;uch an opportunity to have &s;aid they &s;hould not dye.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Honourable Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WEE according to your honours order departed in &s;earch after Col. Goffe and Whaley (per&s;ons de|clared traytors to his Maje&s;tie) from Bo&s;ton May the 7th, 1661, about &s;ix a clock at night, and arrived at Harford the 10th day and repaired to Governour Winthrop and gave him your honours letter and his Maje&s;ties order for the apprehending of Col. Whaley and Goffe, who gave us an accompt that they did not &s;tay there but went directly for New Haven, but informed us that one Symon Lobden guided them to the towne. The honourable Governour carried him&s;elfe very nobly to us, and was very diligent to &s;upply us with all manner of conveniencies for the pro&s;ecu|tion of them, and promi&s;ed all dilligent &s;earch &s;hould be made after them in that juri&s;diction, which was after|wards performed. The 11th day we arrived at Guild|ford and repaired to the Deputy Governor, William Leete, and delivered him your honours letter and the coppie of his Maje&s;ties order for the apprehending of the afore&s;aid per&s;ons, with whome at that time was &s;everall per&s;ons. After the peru&s;al of them, he began to read them audibly, whereupon wee tould him it was convenient to be more private in &s;uch concernements as that was; upon which, withdrawing to a chamber, he tould us he had not &s;eene the two Colonels not in nine weekes. We acquainted him of the information we had received that they were at Newhaven &s;ince that time he mentioned, and thereupon de&s;ired him to furni&s;h us with hor&s;es, &amp;c. which was pre|pared with &s;ome delays, which wee tooke notice of to him, and after our parting with him out of his hou&s;e and in the
<PB N="335" REF="011300_0170_0F86CB43259EEF88">
way to the ordinary, came to us one Dennis Scranton and tould us he would warrant that Col. Goffe and Whaley. at the time of his &s;peaking was harboured at the hou&s;e of one Mr. Davenport, a mini&s;ter at New-Haven, and that one Goodman Bi&s;hop of the towne of Guildford, was able to give us the lyke accompt, and that, without all que&s;tion, Deputy Leete knew as much, and that Mr. Davenport had put in ten pounds worth of fre&s;h provi&s;ions at one tyme in|to his hou&s;e, and that it was imagined it was purpo&s;ely for the entertainment of them.</P>
<P>And the &s;aid Scranton &s;aid further, That Goffe and Whaley &s;hould &s;ay that if they had but two hundred friends that would but &s;tand by them, they would not care for Old or New-England: Whereupon wee a&s;kt him if he would depo&s;e to that: He replied he would, that it was openly &s;poken by them in the head of a companie in the field a traineing. Which words was al&s;o confirmed by &s;everall others, as all&s;o information that Goffe and Whaley was &s;eene verie lately betwixt the hou&s;es of Mr. Daven|port and one Jones, and it was imagined that one lay at one of theire hou&s;es and the other at the others. Upon which wee went back to the Deputies and required our hor&s;es, with aide, and a power to &s;earch and apprehend them; hor&s;es was provided for us, but he refu&s;ed to give us any power to apprehend them, nor order any other, and &s;aid he could doe nothing untill he had &s;poken with one Mr. Gilbert and the re&s;t of the Magi&s;trates: Upon which wee tould him wee &s;hould goe to New-Haven and &s;tay till wee heard from him, but before wee tooke hor&s;e the afore&s;aid Dennis Scranton gave us information, there was an Indian of the towne wanting, which he tould us was to give notice of our comeing. But to our certaine know|ledge one John Megges was &s;ent a hor&s;eback before us, and by his &s;peedie and unexpected goeing &s;o early before day was to give them an information, and the rather be|cau&s;e by the delayes was us'd it was breake of day before wee got to hor&s;e, &s;oe hee got there before us; upon our &s;u&s;picion wee required the Deputie that the &s;aid John

Meggs might bee examined what his bu&s;ine&s;s was that might occa&s;ion his &s;oe early goeing: To which the De|putie an&s;wered that hee did not know any &s;uch thing, and refu&s;ed to examine him; and being at Newhaven, which was on the 13th day, the Deputie arrived within two hours or thereabouts after us and came to us to the court cham|ber, where wee againe acquainted him with the informa|tion wee had received and that wee had cau&s;e to believe they were concealed in Newhaven, and thereupon wee required his a&s;&s;i&s;tance and aide for their apprehen&s;ion: To which he an&s;wered that he did not believe they were. Whereupon wee de&s;ired him to impower us, or order others for it. To which he gave us this an&s;wer, That hee could not, nor would not make us magi&s;trates: Wee replied, wee our&s;elves would per&s;onally adventure in the &s;earch and apprehen&s;ion of them in two hou&s;es where wee had rea&s;on to imagine they lay hid, if they would give way to it and enable us: To which hee re|plied, Hee neither would, nor could not doe any thinge untill the freemen were met together. To which wee &s;et before him the danger of that delay and their inevatable e&s;cape, and how much the honour and &s;ervice of his Ma|je&s;tie was de&s;pi&s;ed and trampled on by him, and that wee &s;uppo&s;ed by his unwillingne&s;s to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the apprehen&s;ion, hee was willing they &s;hould e&s;cape: After which hee left us and went to &s;everall of the magi&s;trates and were toge|ther five or &s;ix hours in con&s;ultation, and upon breakeing up of their coun&s;ell, they tould us, they would not nor could not doe any thing untill they had called a generall court of the freemen: Whereupon wee repre&s;ented to them your Honours and Governour Winthrops warrants as pre|&s;idents, who upon the receite of his Maje&s;ties plea&s;ure and order concerning the &s;aid per&s;ons, &s;tood not upon &s;uch niceties and formallities, but endeavoured to make all ex|pedition in &s;eizing on them, if to bee found in their govern|ment, and all&s;o how your honour had recommended this grand affaire to him, and how much the honour and ju&s;tice of his Maje&s;tie was concerned, and how ill his &s;acred Ma|je&s;tie

would re&s;ent &s;uch horrid and dete&s;table concealments and abettings of &s;uch traitors and regicides as they were, and a&s;kt him whether he would honour and obey the king or noe in this affaire, and &s;ett before him the daunger which by law is incurred by any one that conceales or abetts traytors; to which the Deputie Leete an&s;wered, wee honour his Maje&s;tie, but wee have tender con&s;ciences.</P>
<P>To which wee replied, that wee believed that he knew where they were, and onely pretended tenderne&s;s of con|&s;cience for a refu&s;all: Upon which they drew into con|&s;ultation againe, and after two or three houres &s;pent, in the evening the Deputie and Magi&s;trates came to us at the head of the &s;taires in the ordinarie, and takes one of us by the hand and wi&s;ht he had binn a plowman and had never binn in the office, &s;ince he found it &s;oe weightie.</P>

<P>THE council of our juri&s;diction being a&s;&s;embled the 4th in&s;tant at Bo&s;ton, ordered me to &s;ignify to you what lately they have receaved from England by Captain Leverett, his letter bearing date 12th April 1661, who tells us that however our addre&s;&s;e to his Maje&s;ty came &s;ea&s;onably and had a gracious an&s;wer, yett many com|plaints and claims are multiplied again&s;t us, and that wee are like to heare from his Maje&s;ty's committee what tho&s;e
<PB N="339" REF="011300_0172_0F86CB4481F0BC10">
complaints are, and what is expected from us; that an oath was produced again&s;t him for &s;aying that rather then wee &s;hould or would admitt of appeales here, wee would or &s;hould &s;ell the country to the Spaniards; which though he ab&s;olutely denyed that ever he &s;o &s;aid, and that if he &s;hould have &s;o &s;aid he had wronged the country very much, &s;ome of the &s;aid committee &s;aid the words if &s;poken they were pardoned, but they looked at the words not &s;o much his as the &s;pirit of the country, and tho' againe he de&s;ired that the country might not &s;uffer, in theire minds, for what he knew was &s;o much and &s;o farre from them, as to thinke ought in any &s;uch re&s;pect, yet one of them proceeded to que&s;tion him, whether if wee dur&s;t wee would not ca&s;t off our allegiance and &s;ubjection to his Maje&s;ty; He an&s;wer|ed, he did apprehend wee were hone&s;t men and had de|clared in our application to his Maje&s;ty the contrary, and therefore could not have &s;uch thoughts of us without the breach of charity; that it is no le&s;&s;e than nece&s;&s;ary we had &s;ome able per&s;on to appeare for us, well furni&s;hed to carry on our bu&s;ines, which will not be without money; that the councill for plantations demanded of him whether wee had proclaimed the King and whether there was not much oppo&s;ition to the agreeing of our application. He an&s;wer|ed he knew not, only had heard Capt.

<P>Sir, Since what I wrote, news and certaine intelligence is come hither of the two colonells being at New Haven from Saturday to Monday and publickly knowne, and however it is given out that they came to &s;urrender them&s;elves and pretended by Mr. Gilbert that he looked when they would have come in and delivered up them|&s;elves, never &s;etting a guard about the hou&s;e nor endea|vouring to &s;ecure them, but when it was too late to &s;end to Totocut &amp;c. Sir, How this will be taken is not difficult to imagine, to be &s;ure not well; nay, will not all men condemn you as wanting to your&s;elves, and that you have &s;omething to rely on, at lea&s;t that you hope will an&s;wer your ends? I am not willing to med|dle with your hopes, but if it be a duty to obey &s;uch lawfull warrants, as I believe it is, the neglect thereof will prove uncomfortable.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A writing being exhibited by the honored commi&s;&s;ioners of the generall court for negotiating of our affairs with the king's maje&s;ty and his mo&s;t honorable councill. The tenure whereof was as followeth.</HEAD>
<P>THE honored generall court not having lei&s;ure to communicate, unto their me&s;&s;engers intended, the matter of their mi&s;&s;ion with an opportunity to con&s;ider thereof, and upon its communication by the honored com|mittee theire appeared the&s;e en&s;uing and unexpected difficulties.</P>
<P N="1">1. Two of the magi&s;trates either not giving their placet, or &s;ignifying their non-placet as to the mi&s;&s;ion at this time, the governor and deputy governor being two of them, and though members of the committee, yet declining &s;o much as to owne the bu&s;ines with their pre&s;ence.</P>
<P N="2">2. The very &s;ub&s;tance of the me&s;&s;uage, doubted even by the greater part of the committee (&s;o farre as appear|eth to us) to be inexpedient to the end, if pre&s;ented at this time, in conjunction with the courts in&s;truction to the committee not to recede from the &s;ub&s;tance of what hath been agreed upon by them.</P>
<P N="3">3. The &s;eeming difficulties of preparing any me&s;&s;uage, as becometh, in the &s;treight of time remaining.</P>
<P N="4">4. The hazard of the undertaking, in the judgment of the honored committee, &s;o &s;en&s;ible thereof as that they thought meete to order the me&s;&s;engers (who&s;e coming can|not

<P>THE committee, taking the premi&s;&s;es into their &s;erious con&s;ideration, cannot but look upon it as a humbling providence of God towards his poore people, that whil&s;t they are endeavouring (and as they hope in &s;ome mea&s;ure of &s;incere love to the Lord his truth and ordinances) to wait on God in the u&s;e of all lawfull means left unto them for the pre&s;ervation of &s;uch high favours as in &s;undry re&s;pects he hath been plea&s;ed to betru&s;t us withall, that &s;o many clouds &s;hould hover over our heads for the darkning our pathes, and &s;tumbling blocks appearing in our way to hinder the &s;ame, yet neverthele&s;&s;e being per&s;uaded that not only prudentiall arguments referring to our owne peace and &s;afety, but al&s;o the honor of the Lords name, church and wayes, which is now principally &s;hott at by our ad|ver&s;aries,
<PB N="351" REF="011300_0178_0F86CB51C5AE0290">
doeth call aloud upon us not to delay the u&s;e of all lawful meanes, and this propounded being upon mature councills in &s;undry debates agreed upon as the be&s;t expe|dient conducing to &s;uch an end, doe account it their duty (the &s;aid objections notwith&s;tanding) to further the &s;aid gentlemen in the di&s;charge of the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them, and cannot con&s;ent to any unnece&s;&s;ary delay therein.</P>
<P>Further briefly to the &s;everal partes.</P>
<P>To the fir&s;t, The committee doe indeed concurr with the commi&s;&s;ioners that a more full and explicite acting of the &s;aid honored gentlemen, were very de&s;irable, but yet not e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary. The honored governor having manife&s;ted him&s;elf willing not only to give his approbation to &s;uch commi&s;&s;ion in&s;tructions and particulars as &s;hall be orderly agreed upon, as al&s;o to &s;ign the &s;ame according to the appointment of the generall court.</P>
<P>To the &s;econd, The committee conceive there is no doubt on their part as to this me&s;&s;age, nor yet any incon|&s;i&s;tency of what they have propounded with what the general court agreed upon, but &s;uch as may be rationally interpreted to be the true meaning of the power com|mitted to them.</P>
<P>To the third, The committee doe conceive they are already agreed of the me&s;&s;age, viz. the commi&s;&s;ions in|&s;tructions and petitions as in the former returnes.</P>
<P>To the fourth, That as yet no act hath beene pa&s;&s;ed by them of &s;uch tendency, only &s;ome propo&s;als, where they have rather expre&s;&s;ed their tender re&s;pect towards our honored and deare friends, than any ju&s;t rea&s;on that they have for the entertaining &s;uch fears.</P>
<P>Finally, the committee doe propo&s;e as a further expe|dient for the &s;atisfaction of our honored commi&s;&s;ioners, that they them&s;elves would be plea&s;ed to con&s;ider and pre&s;ent unto us what them&s;elves apprehend there yet remains to be done by us for their furtherance in this &s;o great an un|dertaking, and we hope we &s;hall not be found wanting to their encouragement in what we may.</P>

<P>Sir, I received yours dated 27. 3d. 65. for which I returne humble and hearty thanks, and for the inclo&s;ed narrative, whereby I perceive that the powers of darknes which have prevailed in other parts of the world are at worke here al&s;o, to &s;ubvert the kingdom of Chri&s;t in the&s;e ends of the earth. But God hath not yet &s;aid that this is theire hour in reference to N. E. though our unthank|fulnes for the go&s;pel, unfruitfulne&s;s under it, di&s;&s;obedience
<PB N="393" REF="011300_0199_0F86CB6C51A8E3A8">
to it, declen&s;ions from the &s;implicity that is in Chri&s;t, and &s;inful compliances, &amp;c. have de&s;erved that our hedge &s;hould be broken down. That admonition which Chri&s;t &s;ent unto the church at Ephe&s;us &s;hould &s;ound in our hearts continually, Repent and doe thy fir&s;t workes. For even David had his fir&s;t and his latter wayes. Therefore it is noticed concerning Jeho&s;aphat, in 2 Chron. 17.3. that the Lord was with him, becau&s;e he walked in the fir&s;t waies of his father David. If N. E. would returne to the fir&s;t waies of reformation here begun, according to go&s;pel rules and patternes (from which the compas of the la&s;t &s;ynods conclu&s;ions &s;eemes to be varied by &s;ome degrees towards the antartique, or is newly di&s;covered to be other than I formerly apprehended to have been the way of the&s;e churches) I would hope that the &s;ame onely wi&s;e God who di&s;&s;appointed the councel of that archprelate in the raigne of the la&s;t king (whereby your pattent was once and againe demanded by the &s;aid king, and as often refu&s;ed by your generall court, to be returned to England) would al&s;o &s;till appeare, in this juncture, by fru&s;trating the pre&s;ent de&s;igne and making it an abortion, or a mere tryall of the country, whether they will &s;tand to their church rights and privi|ledges or permit them to be invaded and violated by &s;uch attempts, which when they are tried and found un&s;ucce&s;&s;|ful, will cea&s;e for the future. For the Lord is and will be with his people while they are with him; and if yee &s;eeke him he will be found of you. An experiment here|of you had in the quiet proceeding of your elections, as a gracious an&s;wer to prayers. Their claiming power to &s;it authoritatively as a court for appeales, and that to be ma|naged in an arbitrary way, was a manife&s;t laying of a ground worke to undermine your whole government e&s;tabli&s;hed by your charter. If you had con&s;ented thereunto, you had plucked downe with your owne hands that hou&s;e which wi&s;dom had built for you and your po&s;terity. For all your courts would then have &s;ignified nothing; the &s;entences of them being liable to be di&s;&s;annulled, upon complaints to the commi&s;&s;ioners made by delinquents, as
<PB N="394" REF="011300_0200_0F86CB6E70689018">

Nor can I &s;ee that your pre|&s;erving that authority and juri&s;diction which the la&s;t king, by his roial charter, gave you, can rationally be accounted an oppo&s;ing the &s;overaignety which this king hath over you, &s;eeing <HI>id po&s;&s;unt reges quod jure po&s;&s;unt.</HI> There is indeed a verbal profe&s;&s;ion of pre&s;erving your liberties.

<P>IT doth not a little grieve my &s;pirit to heare what &s;add things are reported dayly of your tyranny and per&s;e|cutions in New-England, as that you fyne, whip and im|pri&s;on men for their con&s;ciences.

Truely, friends, this your practice of compelling any in matters of wor&s;hip to doe that whereof they are not fully per&s;uaded, is to make them &s;in, for &s;oe the apo&s;tle (Rom. 14 and 23.) tells us, and many are made hypocrites thereby, conforming in their outward man for feare of puni&s;hment. We pray for you and wi&s;h you pro&s;|peritie every way, hoped the Lord would have given you &s;o much light and love there, that you might have been eyes to God's people here, and not to practice tho&s;e cour&s;es in a wildernes, which you went &s;o farre to prevent.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured and deare Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY brother Wil&s;on and &s;elfe doe both of us acknow|ledge your love, as otherwi&s;e formerly, &s;o now in the late lines wee received from you, that you grieve in &s;pirit to heare dayly complaints again&s;t us, it &s;pringeth from your compa&s;&s;ion of our afflictions therein, wherein wee &s;ee ju&s;t cau&s;e to de&s;ire you may never &s;uffer like in|jury your&s;elfe, but may finde others to compa&s;&s;ionate and condole with you. For when the complaints you hear of are again&s;t our tyranny and per&s;ecutions in fining, whip|ping and impri&s;oning men for their con&s;ciences, be plea&s;ed to under&s;tand wee looke at &s;uch complaints as altogether injurious in re&s;pect of our&s;elves, who had noe hand or tongue at all to promote either the coming of the per&s;ons you ayme at into our a&s;&s;emblyes, or their puni&s;hment for their carriage there. Righteous judgment will not take up reports, much le&s;&s;e reproaches, again&s;t the innocent. The cry of the &s;innes of Sodome was great and loude, and reached up to heaven; yet the righteous God (giving us an example what to doe in the like ca&s;e) he would fir&s;t goe downe to &s;ee whether their crime were altogether according to the cry, before he would proceede to judge|ment, Gen. 18.20, 21. and when he did finde the truth of the cry, he did not wrap up all alike promi&s;cuou&s;ly in the judgement, but &s;pared &s;uch as he found innocent; wee are among&s;t tho&s;e whom (if you knew us better) you would account of (as the matron of Abel &s;pake of her&s;elfe) peaceable in I&s;rael, 2 Sam. 20.19. Yet neither are wee &s;o va&s;t in our indulgence or toleration as to thinke the men
<PB N="404" REF="011300_0205_0F86CB79A18C12E0">
you &s;peake of &s;uffered an unju&s;t cen&s;ure. For one of them (Obadiah Holmes) being an excommunicate per&s;on him&s;elfe, out of a church in Plymouth patent, came into this juri&s;diction and took upon him to baptize, which I thinke him&s;elfe will not &s;ay he was compelled here to per|forme. And he was not ignorant that the rebaptizing of an elder per&s;on, and that by a private per&s;on our of office and under excommunication, are all of them manife&s;t con|te&s;tations again&s;t the order and government of our churches e&s;tabli&s;hed (wee know) by Gods law, and (he knoweth) by the lawes of the country. And wee conceive wee may &s;afely appeale to the ingenuity of your owne judgement, whether it would be tolerated in any civill &s;tate, for a &s;tranger to come and practi&s;e contrary to the knowne principles of their church-e&s;tate? As for his whipping, it was more voluntarily cho&s;en by him than inflicted on him. His cen&s;ure by the court was to have payed (as I know) 30 pounds or el&s;e to be whipt, his fine was offered to be payed by friends for him freely; but he cho&s;e rather to be whipt; in which ca&s;e, if his &s;uffering of &s;tripes was any wor&s;hip of God at all, &s;urely it could be accounted no better than will-wor&s;hip. The other (Mr. Clarke) was wi&s;er in that point and his offence was le&s;&s;e, &s;o was his fine le&s;&s;e, and him&s;elfe (as I heare) was contented to have it payed for him, whereupon he was relea&s;ed. The impri|&s;onment of either of them was noe detriment. I believe they &s;ared neither of them better at home, and I am &s;ure Holmes had not been &s;o well clad of many yeares before.</P>
<P>But be plea&s;ed to con&s;ider this point a little further. You thinke to compell men in matter of wor&s;hip is to make men &s;inne, according to Rom. 14.23. If the wor&s;hip be lawfull in it&s;elfe, the magi&s;trate compelling him to come to it compelleth him not to &s;inne, but the &s;inne is in his will that needs to be compelled to a chri&s;tian duty. Jo&s;iah compelled all I&s;rael, or (which is all one) made to &s;erve the Lord their God, 2 Chron. 34.33. yet his act herein was not blamed but recorded among&s;t his virtuous actions. For a governour to &s;uffer any within his gates to prophane
<PB N="405" REF="011300_0205_0F86CB79A18C12E0">
the &s;abbath, is a &s;inne again&s;t the 4th commandment, both in the private hou&s;eholder and in the magi&s;trate; and if he requires them to pre&s;ent them&s;elves before the Lord, the magi&s;trate &s;inneth not, nor doth the &s;ubject &s;inne &s;o great a &s;inne as if he did refraine to come. If the magi|&s;trate connive at his ab&s;enting him&s;elfe from &s;abbath duties the &s;inne will be greater in the magi&s;trate than can be in the others pa&s;&s;ive comeing. Naamans pa&s;&s;ive goeing into the hou&s;e of Rimmon did not violate the peace of his con|&s;cience, 2 Kings 5.18 19. Bodily pre&s;ence in a &s;tewes, forced to behold the leudne&s;&s;e of whoredomes there com|mitted, is noe whoredome at all. Noe more is it &s;pirituall whoredome to be compelled by force to goe to ma&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>But (&s;ay you) it doth but make men hypocrites, to com|pell men to conforme the outward man for feare of pu|ni&s;hment. If it did &s;o, yet better to be hypocrites than prophane per&s;ons. Hypocrites give God part of his due, the outward man, but the prophane per&s;on giveth God neither outward nor inward man.</P>
<P>Your prayers for us wee thankfully accept, and wee hope God hath given us &s;o much light and love (which you thinke wee want) that if our native country were more zealous again&s;t horrid bla&s;phemies and here&s;ies than wee be, wee believe the Lord would looke at it as a better improvement of all the great &s;alvations he hath wrought for them than to &s;ett open a wide doore to all abominations in religion. Doe you thinke the Lord hath crowned the &s;tate with &s;o many victoryes that they &s;hould &s;uffer &s;o many mi&s;creants to pluck the crown of &s;overaign|ty from Chri&s;ts head? Some to deny his godhead, &s;ome his manhood; &s;ome to acknowledge noe Chri&s;t, nor hea|ven, nor hell, but what is in a mans &s;elfe? Some to deny all churches and ordinances, and &s;o to leave Chri&s;t noe vi|&s;ible kingdome upon earth? And thus Chri&s;t by ea&s;ing England of the yoke of a kingdome &s;hall forfeit his owne kingdome among the people of England. Now God forbid, God from heaven forbid, that the people and &s;tate of England &s;hould &s;o ill requite the Lord Je&s;us. You

know not, if you thinke wee came into this wilderne&s;&s;e to practi&s;e tho&s;e cour&s;es here which wee fled from in Eng|land. Wee believe there is a va&s;t difference betweene mens inventions and God's in&s;titutions; wee fled from mens inventions, to which wee el&s;e &s;hould have beene compelled; wee compell none to mens inventions.</P>
<P>If our wayes (rigid wayes as you call them) have layd us low in the hearts of God's people, yea and of the &s;aints (as you &s;tile them) wee doe not believe it is any part of their &s;aint&s;hip.

I pre&s;ume they will not openly profe&s;&s;e them|&s;elves enemyes to us, till they have either vanqui&s;ht the Mohaukes, or made peace with them; however I have &s;trengthened my garri&s;on in the fort to with&s;tand their attempts; hereof I have al&s;o &s;ent governor Winthrop an account, and cannot imagine any rea&s;on to the contrary why &s;o faire an advantage again&s;t the French &s;hould bee let &s;lip, &s;ince his Maje&s;ty's directions therein are &s;o po&s;&s;itive. And truly if from your colony a &s;peedy force of hor&s;e and dragoones, not exceeding 150, would march and joyne with a proportionable number of Conecticott colony, in all probability few of the French could return to Canada, who&s;e whole &s;trength is now &s;o farr engaged from home,
<PB N="408" REF="011300_0207_0F86CB7CCB0F9AA0">
and by con&s;equence the re&s;t of the French will not be able to make any con&s;iderable re&s;i&s;tance; the nece&s;&s;ity of your &s;peedy determination is &s;o evident, that I &s;hall not make u&s;e of other arguments, only a&s;&s;uring you of my utmo&s;t endeavours to &s;erve his Maje&s;ty upon this occa&s;ion in the defence of his dominions, not doubting but that the com|mon &s;afety is precious to you, although the danger at pre|&s;ent more immediately threatens this colony; I remitt the con&s;ideration of the premi&s;&s;es to your &s;erious thoughts, and remaine your very affectionate friend and &s;ervant,</P>

<HEAD>Copy of a Narrative of the Commi&s;&s;ioners from England, about New-England.</HEAD>
<P>THE colony of Conecticote returned their humble thankes to his Maje&s;ty for his gracious letters and for &s;ending commi&s;&s;ioners to them, and made great pro|mi&s;es of their loyalty and obedience. And they did &s;ub|mit to have appeales made to his Maje&s;ties commi&s;&s;ioners, who did hear and determine &s;ome differences among them. All formes of ju&s;tice pa&s;&s;e only in his Maje&s;tyes name, they admit all that de&s;ire it to be of their corporation; they will not hinder any from enjoying the &s;acraments and u&s;ing the common prayer book, provided that they hinder not the maintenance of the publick mini&s;ter; they will amend any thing that hath been done derogatory to his Maje&s;tyes honour, if there be any &s;uch thing, &s;o &s;oone as they &s;hall come to the knowledge of it. The bounds betwixt the Dukes province and Conecticote were mi&s;taken by wrong information, for it was not intended that they &s;hould come nearer to Hud&s;on's river then twenty miles, yet the line was &s;et downe by the commi&s;&s;ioners to goe from &s;uch a poynt N. N. W. whereas it ought to goe
<PB N="413" REF="011300_0209_0F86CB7E47D84D00">
ju&s;t N. otherwi&s;e the line will goe into Hud&s;ons river. They have nothing to &s;ay again&s;t Duke Hamiltons pat|tent, but their writings were burnt, and that they bought the land of the Lord Say and Brook and others, and that his Maje&s;ty hath confirmed it to them, and that they never knew that the late Marquis Hamilton had a graunt of it, for he never &s;ent any to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it or to inhabit upon it. Their ea&s;tern bounds are determined to be a line drawn we&s;tward from the mid&s;t of the road Pawtucket river, neere to Shaws hou&s;e. Their northern bounds is the &s;outh line of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets, which, as the collony complaines, is &s;tretched much too &s;outherly. This colony hath many good rivers and harbours, many &s;cattering towns not worthy of their names, and a &s;coller to their mini&s;ter in every town or village, but noe places fortified except Seabrook fort, which is much gone to decay, and here, for the mo&s;t part, they are rigid pre&s;byterians.</P>
<P>The colony of Road I&s;land and Providence plantations returned their humble thankes to his Maje&s;ty for &s;ending commi&s;&s;ioners and made great demon&s;tration of their loy|alty and obedience. They approved, as mo&s;t rea&s;onable, that appeals &s;hould be made to his Maje&s;tyes commi&s;&s;ioners, who having heard and determined &s;ome cau&s;es among them, referred other &s;ome, in civility, to their generall court, and &s;ome to the governor and others; &s;ome of which cau&s;es they again remitted to the commi&s;&s;ioners to be de|termined. All proceedings are in his Maje&s;tyes name, they admit all to be freemen that de&s;ire it; they allow liberty of con&s;cience and wor&s;hip to all who live civilly, and if any can inform them of any thing in their lawes or practi|&s;es derogatory to his Maje&s;tyes honour, they will amend it. The Marquis of Hamiltons pattent takes in all Road I&s;land colony and about half of Conecticote. The Narhigan&s;et Sachims did in the year 1664, by writing, &s;urrender them|&s;elves, their people and country, into the late Kings pro|tection; two of which Sachims, now living, did actually, in their own per&s;ons, &s;urrender them&s;elves, people and coun|try, into his royall Maje&s;tyes protection before his com|mi&s;&s;ioners,
<PB N="414" REF="011300_0210_0F86CB7F18561E28">
and deliverd to them them that very deed made in 1664, which had been carefully kept by Mr. Gorton, &amp;c. whereupon the commi&s;&s;ioners, according to their in&s;truc|tions, entred upon the country in his Maje&s;tyes name and have named it the Kings province, have taken the na|tives into his Maje&s;tyes protection, and have appoynted ju&s;tices of the peace to govern it untill his Maje&s;tyes plea|&s;ure be farther known. For this Narhygan&s;et country is allmo&s;t all the land belonging to the country, the which cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without it, and therefore the commi&s;&s;ioners ordered that the magi&s;trates for the colony &s;hould be ju&s;ti|ces of the peace for the Kings province, that noe difference may ari&s;e betwixt the officers. The Sachims did thank|fully receive the two coates pre&s;ented to them in his Ma|je&s;tyes name. In acknowledgment of their &s;ubjection they are to pay yearly, upon the 26th of May, two wolf &s;kins to his Maje&s;ty, and did now &s;end two caps of peague and two clubs inlayed with peague for a pre&s;ent to the King, and a feather mantle and a porcupine bag for a pre&s;ent to the Queen, which ware all taken by the Dutch. One of the&s;e princes, named Pa&s;&s;icus, de&s;ired the commi&s;&s;ioner to pray King Charles that noe &s;trong liquor might be brought into that country, for he had 32 men that died by drink|ing of it. The&s;e Indian princes gave a long petition to the commi&s;&s;ioners, complaining of many acts of violence and inju&s;tice which the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets had done to them: Among others, they fir&s;t cau&s;ed them to be fined, then tooke their whole country in mortgage (according to the remon&s;trance &s;ent to his Maje&s;ty) and would have juggled them out of it; but there could be noe redre&s;&s;e, the Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;ets refu&s;ing to let the commi&s;&s;ioners have the hearing of appeals. Their we&s;tern bounds are determined with Conecticote, their northern bounds mu&s;t be the Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;ets &s;outhern line, wherever it falls (which they complain to be too &s;outherly) their ea&s;tern bounds betwixt them and New Plymouth could not be determined by con&s;ent of both parties (Road I&s;land claiming a &s;hred of land 3 miles broad all the length of the maine land lying next to
<PB N="415" REF="011300_0210_0F86CB7F18561E28">
the Narhygan&s;et i&s;land, which they of New Plymouth could not part with without great prejudice) whereupon commi&s;&s;ioners appoynted the water (the naturall bounds of each colony) to be their pre&s;ent bounds, untill his Ma|je&s;tves plea&s;ure be farther known. Mr. William Brenton, deputy governor of Road I&s;land, having bought a farm upon that &s;hred of land which he hoped would belong to that colony, humbly de&s;ires his Maje&s;ty that he may continue to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e that farme though it falls within the line of New Plymouth, and Doctor Alcock, a phy&s;ician, having bought Block I&s;land for 400<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> of &s;ome of Bo&s;ton, who took upon them power (never graunted them) to &s;ell it, and having been at great charges in planting of it, de&s;ires his Maje&s;ty that he may not be di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it, he humbly &s;ubmitting to the government of Road I&s;land; both the&s;e petitions to his Maje&s;ty are lo&s;t. This colony, which ad|mits of all religions, even Quakers and Genneralli&s;ts, was begun by &s;uch as the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets would not &s;uffer to live among them and is generally hated by the other colonyes, who endeavoured &s;everall wayes to &s;uppre&s;&s;e them; they maintained &s;everal other Indians again&s;t the Narhygan&s;et Indians. The commi&s;&s;ioners of the united colonyes di&s;|po&s;ed of a great part of this country, pretending they had conquered it from the Pequod Indians, but evidence being made that the Narhygan&s;ets had conquered it before the Engli&s;h began their war, and that the right was in him who had &s;old it to the Road I&s;landers, and his Maje&s;tyes commi&s;&s;ioners not thinking it ju&s;tifiable for any colony to di&s;po&s;e of land without their own lymits, determined it for the Road I&s;landers. The Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets did maintain Pumham (a petty Sachim in this province) twenty years again&s;t this colony and his chief Sachim, and did, by armed &s;oldiers, be&s;iedge and take pri&s;oners Mr. Gorton, Howden, Weeks, Green and others in this province, and carryed them to Bo&s;ton, put them in chains, and took eighty head of cattle from them, for all which they could never yet get &s;atisfaction. This colony could never be acknowledged for a colony till his Maje&s;ty's
<PB N="416" REF="011300_0211_0F86CB7FC17D6C88">
charter was publi&s;hed, though in the year 1643 they &s;ent over &s;ome into England to procure the King's charter then, but finding that unnaturall war begun, and the King gone from London, they took a charter from the lords and commons, which was more then Newhaven did pretend to, and more then Conecticot could &s;hew, yet the&s;e two were admitted colonys in their great combination, and Road I&s;land &s;lighted. The Narhygan&s;et bay is the large&s;t and &s;afe&s;t port in New-England neare&s;t the &s;ea and fitte&s;t for trade; this colony hath two &s;cattered towns upon Road I&s;land, two upon the maine land, and four &s;mall villages; here only yet is lime &s;tone found, and here only the gover|nour and magi&s;trates &s;erve the publick at their own charge. In this colony is the greate&s;t number of Indians, yet they had never any thing allowed towards the civillizing and converting the Indians, and in this colony they have the greate&s;t playnes, but noe place of &s;trength fortified, altho' many places capable of fortification. In this province is the be&s;t Engli&s;h gra&s;&s;e and mo&s;t &s;heep, the ground very fruitfull, ewes bringing ordinarily two lambs, corn yields eighty for one, and in &s;ome places they have had corn twenty &s;ix years together without manuring. In this pro|vince only they have not any places &s;ett apart for the wor|&s;hip of God, there being &s;oe many &s;ubdivided &s;ects they cannot agree to meet together in one place, but according to their &s;everal judgments they &s;ometimes a&s;&s;ociate in one hou&s;e &s;ometimes in another.</P>
<P>The colony of New-Plymouth did &s;ubmit to have ap|peals made to the commi&s;&s;ioners, who here had but one plaint to them, which was, that the governour would not let a man enjoy a farm of four miles &s;quare which he had bought of an Indian, the complaint &s;oone &s;ubmitted to the governor when he under&s;tood the unrea&s;onablenes by it. They are here con&s;trained to per&s;wade men, &s;ometimes to compell there, to be free men, &s;oe far are they from hinder|ing any. This colony is &s;eated on a neck of land the barane&s;t part of the country. They were the fir&s;t plan|ters in New-England, though the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts got the
<PB N="417" REF="011300_0211_0F86CB7FC17D6C88">
fir&s;t charter, and &s;ince hath much &s;treightned this colony by &s;tretching their line &s;o much &s;outherly. They &s;hewed their charter and gave a copy of it to their commi&s;&s;ioners, and told them they were &s;o poore they could not renew it; whereupon the commi&s;&s;ioners took occa&s;ion to offer to get their charter renewed and delivered to them at the com|mi&s;&s;ioners own charge, if, for a further demon&s;tration of their loyalty, they would let his Maje&s;ty choo&s;e one of three (who&s;e names them&s;elves &s;hould &s;end to the King) to be their governor, and this to be done every 3 yeare, or every 5 years, which they thought be&s;t. The com|mi&s;&s;ioners thought if this had &s;ucceeded in this the fir&s;t colony they had vi&s;itted it might have been a good exam|ple for the re&s;t; but after the generall a&s;&s;embly had con|&s;idered of it, with many thankes to the commi&s;&s;ioners and great prote&s;tations of their loyalty to the King, they cho&s;e to be as they were. They have about twelve &s;mall towns, one &s;aw mill for boards, one bloomary for iron, neither good river nor good harbour, nor any place of &s;trength; they are &s;oe poore, they are not able to maintain &s;collers to their mini&s;ters, but are nece&s;&s;itated to make u&s;e of a guifted brother in &s;ome places.</P>
<P>The collony of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts was the la&s;t and hardlie&s;t per&s;waded to u&s;e his Maje&s;tyes name in the forms of ju&s;tice. In this collony, at the fir&s;t coming over of the commi&s;&s;ioners, were many untruths rai&s;ed and &s;ent into the collonyes, as that the King had &s;ent to rai&s;e 5000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> yearly for his Maje&s;tyes u&s;e, whereupon Major Hawthorne made a &s;editious &s;peech at the head of his company, and the late Governor another at their meeting hou&s;e in Bo&s;ton, but neither of them were &s;oe much as que&s;tioned for it by any of their magi&s;trates. The commi&s;&s;ioners vi&s;itted all other collonyes before this, hoping both that the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and conde&s;cention of the other collonyes to his Maje&s;tyes de|&s;ires would have abated the refractorine&s;&s;e of this collony, which they much feared, and that the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Colonel Nicholls (whome they expected) would have prevailed much: But neither examples nor rea&s;ons could prevaile

with them to let the commi&s;&s;ioners hear and determine &s;oe much as tho&s;e particular ca&s;es (Mr. Deanes and the Indian Sachims) which the King had commanded them to take care of and doe ju&s;tice in: And though the commi&s;&s;ioners, who never de&s;ired they &s;hould appear as delinquents but as defendents, either by them&s;elves or by their attorneys, a&s;&s;ured them that if they had been unju&s;tly complained of to his Maje&s;ty, their fal&s;e accu&s;ers &s;hould be &s;everely pu|ni&s;hed, and their ju&s;t dealing made known to his Maje&s;ty and all the world, yet they proclaimed by &s;ound of trum|pet that the generall court was the &s;upreame&s;t judicatory in all that province, that the commi&s;&s;ioners pretending to hear appeals was a breach of their priviledges graunted them by the Kings royall father and confirmed to them by his Maje&s;tyes own letter, and that they &s;hould not per|mitt it; by which they have for the pre&s;ent &s;ilenced above 30 petitions which de&s;ired ju&s;tice again&s;t them, and were all lo&s;t at &s;ea. To elude his Maje&s;tyes de&s;ire of their ad|mitting men civill and of competent e&s;tates to be freemen, they have made an act, whereby he that is 24 years old, a hou&s;ekeeper, and brings a certificate of his civill life, ano|ther of his being orthodox in matters of faith, and a third of his paying ten &s;hillings, be&s;ide head money, at a &s;ingle rate, may then have liberty to make his de&s;ires known to the court, and then it &s;hall be put to vote. The com|mi&s;&s;ioners examined many town&s;hips, and found that &s;carce three in a hundred pay ten &s;hillings at a &s;ingle rate; yet, if this rate were generall it would be ju&s;t; but he that is a church member, though he be a &s;ervant and pay not two pence, may be a freeman: They will not admitt any who is not a member of their church to communion, nor their children to bapti&s;me, yet they will marry their children to tho&s;e whome they will not admitt to bapti&s;me, if they be rich: They did impri&s;on and barbarou&s;ly u&s;e Mr. Jour|dan for baptizing children, as him&s;elf complained in his petition to the commi&s;&s;ioners. Tho&s;e whom they will not admitt to the communion they compell to come to their &s;ermons, by forcing from them five &s;hillings for every

neglect; yet the&s;e men thought their paying one &s;hilling for not coming to prayers in England was an un&s;upport|able tyranny: They have put many Quakers to death, of other provinces, for which al&s;o they are petitioned again&s;t; fir&s;t they bani&s;hed them, as Quakers, upon payn of death, and then executed them for returning: They have beate &s;ome to jelly, and have been otherwayes exceeding cruell to others, and they &s;ay the king allows it in his letters to them; indeed they have mi&s;con&s;trued all the king's letters to their own &s;ence. They yet pray con&s;tantly for their per&s;ecuted brethren in England. They have many things in their laws derogatory to his Maje&s;ty's honnor, of which the commi&s;&s;ioners made a breviate and de&s;ired that they might be altered, but they have yet done nothing in it; among others, whoever keeps Chri&s;t|mas day is to pay five pounds. They cau&s;ed at length a mapp of their territoryes to be made, but it was made in a chamber by direction and gue&s;&s;e: in it they claim fort Albany, and beyond it all the land to the &s;outh &s;ea. By their &s;outh &s;ea line they intrench upon the colonys of New Plymouth, Road I&s;land and Conecticote; and in the ea&s;t they have u&s;urped Capt. Ma&s;ons and Sir Ferdinando Gorges pattents; and &s;aid that the commi&s;&s;ioners had no|thing to doe betwixt them and Mr. Gorges, becau&s;e his Maje&s;ty neither commanded them to deliver po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to Mr. Gorges, or to give his Maje&s;ty rea&s;on why they did not. The commi&s;&s;ioners being at Per&s;cataqua when they received his Maje&s;tyes letter which commanded them to &s;ee the harbours fortified, &amp;c. &s;ent their warrants to four towns upon that river, requiring them to meet at &s;uch a time and place to hear his Maje&s;tyes letter read, one of the&s;e warrants was &s;ent po&s;t to Bo&s;ton, from whence two mar&s;halls are &s;ent from the governor and coun&s;ell with an|other warrant to forbid the towns either to meet or doe any thing commanded them by the commi&s;&s;ioners, at their utmo&s;t perills; and withall &s;ent an unbe&s;eeming letter to the commi&s;&s;ioners, both which letter and warrant were lo&s;t at &s;ea. Col. Whaley and Gough were entertained by the magi&s;trates with great &s;olemnity and fea&s;ted in every place,

after they were told they were traytors and ought to be apprehended; they made their abode at Cambridge untill they were furni&s;hed with hor&s;es and a guide and &s;ent away to Newhaven; for their more &s;ecurity, Capt. Daniell Gookin is reported to have brought over and to manage their e&s;tates; and the commi&s;&s;ioners being informed that he had many cattle at his farm in the Kings province which were &s;uppo&s;ed to be Whalyes or Goughs, cau&s;ed them to be &s;eazed for his Maje&s;tyes u&s;e, till further order, but Capt. Gookin, &s;tanding upon the priviledge of their charter and refu&s;ing to an&s;wer before the commi&s;&s;ioners, as &s;oe, there was noe more done in it; Capt.

They of this colony &s;ay that King Charles the fir&s;t gave them power to make laws and to execute them, and graunted them a charter as a warrant again&s;t him&s;elf and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and that &s;o long as they pay the fifth part of all gold and &s;ilver oare which they &s;hall gett they &s;hall be free to u&s;e the privileges graunted them, and that they are not obliged to the King but by civillity; they hope by writing to tire the King, Lord Chancellor and Secretaryes too; &s;eaven years they can ea&s;ily &s;pin out by writing, and before that time a change may come, nay, &s;ome have dared to &s;ay, who knows what the event of this Dutch war will be? This colony furni&s;h|ed Cromwell with many in&s;truments out of their corpo|ration and their collidg, and tho&s;e that have retreated thether &s;ince his Maje&s;ty's happy return are much re&s;|pected, and many advanced to be magi&s;trates. They did &s;olicit Cromwell, by one Mr. Win&s;low, to be declared a free &s;tate, and many times in their lawes &s;tiling them&s;elves this &s;tate, this common wealth, and now beleve them&s;elves to be &s;oe. They demand what taxes they plea&s;e, but their accounts could never yet be &s;een.

among&s;t them over tens, twentyes, fiftyes. The lives manners and actions of tho&s;e whom they &s;ay are converted, cannot be di&s;tingui&s;hed from tho&s;e who are not, except it be by being hired to hear &s;ermons, which the more gene|rous natives &s;corn. This colony, which hath ingro&s;&s;ed the whole trade of New-England and is therefore the riche&s;t, hath many townes, but not one regularly built within its ju&s;t limitts, which the commi&s;&s;ioners &s;uppo&s;e to be Seconett brook on the S. W. and Merimack river on the N. E. and two right lines drawn from each of tho&s;e two places, till they come within 20 miles of Hud&s;on river, for that river is already planted and given to his royall highne&s;s. Bo&s;ton is the chief town in it, and &s;eated upon a penin|&s;ula in the bottom of a bay, which is a good harbour and full of fi&s;h. It was fortified this year 1665 with two block hou&s;es, they had, before, a ca&s;tle upon an i&s;land in the roade where &s;hips mu&s;t pa&s;&s;e, about 5 or 6 miles from the town. Their hou&s;es are generally wooden, their &s;treets crooked, with little decency and noe uniformity and, there, neither months, dayes, &s;ea&s;ons of the year, churches nor inns are known by their Engli&s;h names. At Cambridg they have a wooden collidg and, in the yard, a brick pile of two bayes for the Indians, where the com|mi&s;&s;ioners &s;aw but one; they &s;aid they had 3 or more at &s;cooll. It may be feared this collidg may afford us many &s;ci&s;maticks to the church, and the corporation as many rebells to the king, as formerly they have done, if not timely prevented. In this colony too the king hath many loyall &s;ubjects, who petitioned this general court at his Maje&s;ty's fir&s;t coming in, for the owning of his Maje&s;ty, and now la&s;tly for complying with his Maje&s;ty's commi&s;|&s;ioners, but have had neither an&s;wer nor good look &s;ince; they are &s;orry that &s;oe few (for there are &s;carce above 8 of the mo&s;t factious) &s;hould carry on &s;oe &s;trong a faction, yet they are &s;o over-awed that they can doe nothing to remedy it. They only &s;ay it is now with them as it was with the king's party in Cromwell's time; one of tho&s;e was derided for being &s;oe civill to accompany one of the

commi&s;&s;ioners from the town where he lived to Bo&s;ton, and others in Bo&s;ton derided tho&s;e of Road I&s;land for hav|ing yielded &s;oe much to the commi&s;&s;ioners. In Bo&s;ton lyes 10 iron guns brought from the French fort taken in Cromwell's time, which would doe well at Pe&s;cataqua to defend the mouth of that river, where the ma&s;ts are laden, if they be the king's. On the 10th of September 1664 they publi&s;hed by order of court a paper to deter and af|frighten all from making any complaints to the commi&s;|&s;ioners. The commodities of the country are fi&s;h, which is &s;ent into France, Spain and the Streights, pipe &s;taves, ma&s;ts, firr boards, &s;ome pitch and tarr, pork, beef, hor&s;es, and corn, which they &s;end to Virginia, Barbados, &amp;c. and take tobacko and &s;ugar for payment, which they after &s;end for England. There is good &s;tore of iron made in this province; their way of government is common wealth like; their way of wor&s;hip is rude and called congregational, they are zealous in it, for they per&s;ecute all other formes.</P>
<P>New-Hamp&s;hire is the name of a province granted to Capt. Robert Ma&s;on about the year 1635, and was to be|gin on the &s;ea coa&s;t 3 miles E. of Merimack river, and reaches to Pe&s;cataqua, and 60 miles of that breadth up into the country; but now it is u&s;urped by the Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts who pretend that it is within their bounds, and that the people petitioned to be within their protection; it is true that difference of oppinion made a divi&s;ion among them, and a few who were for congregationall churches did petition for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, by which occa&s;ion, partly by force and partly by compo&s;ition, they have engro&s;&s;ed the whole and named it Norfolk. When the Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;etts charter was fir&s;t graunted, the mouths only of the two rivers, Charles and Merimack, were known to them, for they dur&s;t not travill far up into the country, pre&s;ently after there was a hou&s;e erected three large miles from Merimack, which was for 17 years called and known to be the bounds of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and in that time was this pattent graunted to Capt. Ma&s;on. Mr. Wheelwright was bani&s;hed out of the juri&s;diction of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and was
<PB N="423" REF="011300_0214_0F86CB836DDBD670">
permitted to inhabit immediately beyond the bound hou&s;e, as him&s;elf gave te&s;timony before the commi&s;&s;ioners. Mr. Ma&s;on had a pattent for &s;ome land about Cape Ann before the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts had their fir&s;t pattent, whereupon Capt. Ma&s;on, and Mr. Cradock, who was the fir&s;t governor of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and lived in London, agreed that the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts &s;hould have that land which was graunted to Capt. Ma&s;on about Cape Ann, and Capt. Ma&s;on &s;hould have that land which was beyond Merimack river, and graunted to the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. This agreement was &s;ent to Mr. Henry Jo&s;lin to get recorded at Bo&s;ton, but before he could have lea&s;ure to goe thither he heard that Capt. Ma&s;on was dead, and therefore went not, of this he made affidavit before the commi&s;&s;ioners, who forbore to doe any thing about the limitts of this province till this might more fully be proved, though the generallity of the peo|ple petitioned to be taken from under the tyranny of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, as them&s;elves &s;tiled it. The Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, &s;ince they have had the government of this land, have graunted and divided the province into &s;everal town&s;hips, which are very long and thin, three of which are &s;eated upon Pe&s;cataqua river, which is a very good harbour and very capable of fortification; here are excellent ma&s;ts got|ten, and here dry docks might be made, and upon the river are above twenty &s;aw mills, and here are great &s;tore of pipe &s;taves made, and great &s;tore of good timber &s;poyled.</P>
<P>The province of Mayne begins at the E. &s;ide of Pe&s;ca|taqua, and reacheth to Kennebeck river; it was named and graunted to Sir Ferdinando Gorges by king Charles the fir&s;t, but was u&s;urped al&s;o by the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts under pre|tence that it was within the limitts of their charter, and that the people petitioned to be under their government, and they named it York&s;hire. One gentleman, who re|fu&s;ed to &s;ubmitt to the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and &s;uffered great lo&s;&s;e by them, &s;hewed the commi&s;&s;ioners a warrant the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts made to have him brought to Bo&s;ton alive or dead, and now demands ju&s;tice again&s;t them. This province upon petition of the inhabitants and the diffe|rence
<PB N="424" REF="011300_0215_0F86CB842FD9DCD8">
betwixt Mr. Gorges commi&s;&s;ioners and the Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts, his Maje&s;ty's commi&s;&s;ioners took into his Maje&s;|ty's protection and government, and appoynted ju&s;tices of the peace to govern them untill his Maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure be farther known. The inhabitants afterwards petitioned his Maje&s;ty that they might allways continue under his Maje&s;ty's immediate government, and that Sir Rob. Carr might continue their governor under his Maje&s;ty, which petition was lo&s;t at &s;ea: In this province all&s;o lives an In|dian Sachim, who lives neer to the great lake, from whence flowes Merimack river; petitioned his Maje&s;ty to take him into his protection, which was all&s;o lo&s;t. In this province there are but few townes and tho&s;e much &s;cattered, as ge|nerally they are throughout New-England; they are ra|ther farmes than townes: But in this province there is a bay called Ca&s;co bay, in which are very many i&s;lands, two outletts to the &s;ea, many good harbours and great &s;tore of fi&s;h and oy&s;ters, crabs and lob&s;ters. In this province, as in all the re&s;t there are great &s;tore of wild ducks, gee&s;e and deer in their &s;ea&s;ons, &s;trawberyes, ra&s;beryes, goo&s;beryes, barberyes, and &s;everall &s;orts of billberyes, &s;everall &s;orts of oaks and pines, che&s;nut trees, wallnut trees, &s;ometimes for four of five miles together; the northerly the country the better the timber is accounted: On the N. E. of Kenibeck river, which is the bounds of the province of Mayn, upon Ship&s;cot river and upon Pemaquid, 8 or 10 miles a&s;under, are 3 &s;mall plantations belonging to his royall highne&s;&s;e, the bigge&s;t of which hath not above 30 hou&s;es in it, and tho&s;e very mean ones too, and &s;pread over 8 miles at lea&s;t. Tho&s;e people, for the mo&s;t part, are fi&s;hermen and never had any government among them, mo&s;t of them are &s;uch as have fled hether from other places to avoide ju&s;tice. Some here are of opinion that as many men may &s;hare in a woman as they doe in a boat, and &s;ome have done &s;oe. The commi&s;&s;ioners, for nece&s;&s;ity &s;ake, have appoynted the be&s;t whom they could find, in each place, to be a ju&s;tice of peace, and have ordered 3 of tho&s;e ju&s;tices of the peace in the province of Mayn, who live

next to them, to joyn with them in holding of &s;e&s;&s;ions, till further order be taken. In the&s;e parts are the be&s;t white oaks for &s;hip timber. All the lands graunted to his royall highne&s;&s;e in the&s;e north parts of New England, except the&s;e 3 plantations, are all&s;o graunted to Sir Thomas Temple, in the pattent of Nova Scotia.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Narrative was undoubtedly the work of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, or &s;ome Per&s;on employed by them.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Worthy Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Was for &s;ome time pa&s;t very unwilling to believe that you would rea&s;&s;ume a power of government in the province of Mayne or Yorke&s;hire, the ab&s;olute deci&s;ion whereof is lodged with his Maje&s;ty; and &s;urely it will appeare an open breach of duty that any of his Maje&s;tyes inferiour courtes &s;hould u&s;urpe a power over townes and per&s;ons after it hath plea&s;ed his Maje&s;ty to &s;ignifie his plea&s;ure to your&s;elves, in the&s;e following words: "And for the better preventing of all differences and di&s;putes upon the bounds and lymitts of the &s;eaverall collonyes, his Ma|je&s;tyes plea&s;ure is, that all determinations made by his Maje&s;tyes &s;ayd commi&s;&s;ioners with reference to the &s;ayd bounds and lymitts may &s;till continue and be ob&s;erved till upon a full repre&s;entation of all pretences his Maje&s;tye &s;hall make his owne finall determination," &amp;c. Which very words you will finde in your owne letter from his Ma|je&s;ty, concluding thus: "And his Maje&s;ty expects that full obedience be given to this &s;ignification of his plea&s;ure in all particulars. Given at the court at Whitehall, the 10th day of Aprill 1666, in the 18th year of his Maje&s;tyes raigne, by his Maje&s;tyes command, Wm. Morice." But I have now &s;eene the order of your la&s;t generall court, in an&s;wer to the petition of &s;ome re&s;tle&s;&s;e and unquiet &s;pirits, wherein your re&s;olution is already taken to &s;end commi&s;&s;io|ners to keepe a court and to exerci&s;e ju&s;tice, &amp;c. as under your government. I know you have force enough to compell mo&s;t of your neighbours to &s;ubmitt to your go|vernment; but if you thinke his Maje&s;tyes arme will ne|ver be &s;tretched forth to defend his &s;ubjects from u&s;urpa|tion, you may attempt any thinge under the notion of &s;ettling peace and order.

<P>WE received yours dated from Bo&s;ton Aug. 21. 1671. directed to many of us, which al&s;o we have &s;eve|rall times con&s;idered, as the providence of God hath per|mitted to us opportunities of meeting together. The im|portance of the contents thereof, together with the honor and re&s;pect we owe you all, obligeth us to return you &s;uch an&s;wer as we are at pre&s;ent capable of, according to that di&s;po&s;all which it hath plea&s;ed the infinitely wi&s;e God to make of us in our &s;tations, and al&s;o of the conditions which he hath mea&s;ured out to his people among&s;t whom he hath placed us, from whom, as well as our&s;elves, you cannot expect (as things &s;tand with us) to receive that fruit that either your need calls for or our love would produce, were we not our&s;elves, together with the churches of Chri&s;t in the&s;e nations, intangled in many &s;traits, and thereby call'd to a more univer&s;all de&s;ignment of what God hath graciou&s;ly left his poor people to the &s;upportation of the intere&s;t of his go&s;pell and the mini&s;ters and profe&s;&s;ors thereof, who&s;e daily relief depends, as to many counties, principally upon this citty, from whom al&s;o we mu&s;t pro|mi&s;e our&s;elves the greate&s;t part if not all of that little we can hope to attain to, to expre&s;&s;e the value we have for the intere&s;t of our dear Lord Je&s;us among&s;t you, and more e&s;pecially the promoting of the continuance of it in our a&s;&s;i&s;tence to the education of &s;uch as may by the ble&s;&s;ing of his grace and &s;pirit be u&s;efull in their generation for the running and glorifying of his go&s;pell in and by your numerous growing po&s;terity.</P>
<P>As to the three branches of your letter, which com|prize the whole of it, we doe according to the be&s;t of our judgments repre&s;ent our thoughts to you which we hope will be acceptable to you, as you may find in it any labor of love towards you.</P>
<P><PB N="430" REF="011300_0218_0F86CB8DEB101410">Fir&s;t, We join with you in that humble thankfullne&s;&s;e which is due to the God and Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that he hath for &s;o long a time planted and conti|nued among&s;t you a &s;chool of the prophets, from whence have i&s;&s;ued &s;uch in&s;truments as God hath u&s;ed for &s;ervice to him&s;elf, even in both Englands, and heartily condole, that not only the dead &s;tones, but al&s;o the living ones in that foundation are &s;o much crumbled and dimini&s;hed, and gladly would we contribute our helping hand to the repairing of the one and the reviving of the other, were our power &s;uited to our wills. But upon con&s;ideration of the &s;traits and troubles the mini&s;ters and churches of Chri&s;t are here wre&s;tling with, and after con&s;ultation had with &s;ome wi&s;e and godly gentlemen, &s;incere lovers of you, we find in our&s;elves and them the concentring of the &s;ame thoughts, that the exhau&s;ted pur&s;es of tho&s;e that are mo&s;t able to contribute, cannot reach any &s;umme con&s;iderable to|wards the repair of the edifice, &s;o many of God's &s;ervants here calling for daily relief, even of nece&s;&s;aries to them and their impoveri&s;hed families, yet have we advi&s;ed about &s;ending you what a&s;&s;i&s;tance God &s;hall enable us unto for the maintenance of Fellows and Tutors for the in&s;truc|tion and education of youths, who may be bred up in good literature and fear of the Lord, for future imploy|ment in church and common-wealth, in which we can &s;ay there is a reall zeale for you and them in this great con|cerne. Several wayes have been propo&s;ed and debated, we cannot yet acquaint you with any fully determinate meanes for effecting, yet this we were willing to advi&s;e you of, that you are in our hearts, and that we are fully purpo&s;ed (if the pre&s;ent liberty we have to meet be not interrupted by tho&s;e pre&s;aged hurryes which &s;eeme to be in the womb of Providence coming upon us) to u&s;e all our indeavour to collect &s;uch &s;ummes of money (and &s;o to di&s;po&s;e them by the be&s;t advice we can take) as may in time amount to &s;ome comfortable help towards the end which we &s;pecified before, in the &s;ervice whereof we judge that which is mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for you (at lea&s;t that we are capable of) may be attended.</P>

admit us unto the hearing of among&s;t them&s;elves for our formation in the &s;tate of the ca&s;e, the&s;e propo&s;als following.</P>
<P N="1">1.

<P N="2">2.

<P>YOUR &s;hort letter with the trea&s;urer's and your bills I received, which were very welcome, having re|ceived by them the newes of your hopeful recovery from &s;oe great an illne&s;s, wherein God hath &s;pared you to that country as a publique mercy I hope as well as your friends and family, which the Lord in mercy continue, and carry you on in your worke to the perfecting of that

which God in his councell hath further to continue your u&s;e and &s;ervices to accompli&s;h. According to your orders the 100<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> is payd in to Mr. Floyd upon Mr. Raw&s;on's ac|count, and 64<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> 10<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> received into my owne hands by vertue of the bill &s;ent by Mr. Salton&s;tall, and the new one of 44<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> 10<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> charged on Capt. Peirce, which is in my hands, &s;aving what hath binn di&s;bur&s;ed, according to your order, to Mr. Ru&s;hworth, whom I have, as you directed, employed &s;ince 24th June la&s;t, to have an eye upon your affayres, though I neglect it not my&s;elfe. I agreed to give him 3 guynies a quarter and have accordingly payd him 9 at the rates they goe, which is 20<ABBR>s.</ABBR> a piece, and have agreed to be at all contingent charges of fees or tran&s;cribing papers; which be&s;ides a croune or thereabout which I have layd out is all yet out of pur&s;e; unle&s;s you &s;hall think fitt to allow any thing towards the charges of the publique papers I have formerly and now &s;ent, which I have hitherto payd out of my owne wholly. Your letter directed to Dr. Owen, Mr. Woodbridge and my&s;elfe, wee did not communicate to him, his abode being at Newberry and &s;eldome in towne, and, betwixt you and I, wee judge one that is not very likely to be &s;erviceable to you. You need not give any account of it to Mr. Symons. Through Gods goodne&s;s there is not the lea&s;t cau&s;e to write to you about any thing at pre&s;ent that concernes you, &s;aving that New-York being re&s;tored by the peace one Mr. Andrews is appointed governor, a man I know not; and &s;ome rumour is mali|ciou&s;ly &s;pread at court that you have made peace with the Dutch there, which is obviated by the readine&s;s of &s;ome per&s;ons to &s;hew the fal&s;hood of it. I hope nothing will for this year further di&s;turbe you, and if any thing doe ari&s;e it will be from New-Yorke and the government there, I have therefore greatly encouraged &s;ome gentlemen your friends, who would purcha&s;e it of his royall highne&s;s, as thinking it will be much for your peace, who are about it, but how it will i&s;&s;ue I know not. Mr. Ru&s;hworth hath not had any thing to doe for you as yet, but only to at|tend what the council table or council of trade &s;hould

pa&s;&s;e, before the la&s;t of which Plymouth patent hath layn long, but nothing done in it. I hope you &s;hall want no infor|mation, only I hear the King is offended that &s;ome of your &s;hips take in their lading from Virginia and goe to France and defraud his cu&s;tomes, as al&s;oe from other plantations; to which I know not what to &s;ay. The truth is, pro|roguing the parliament is &s;ome yea much di&s;content to them, when they had &s;oe many good things before them, and the pre&s;ent tran&s;actions in Europe, with the kings va&s;t debts, and their not having yet come to any re&s;olve as to the future way of paying of them, takes up all their thoughts that they have little time to mind &s;uch minute things as yours, untill &s;ome old things be againe revived or new provocations given, in which I doubt not God will enable you to walke wi&s;ely. All the publique news and papers mo&s;t choyce, as to manu&s;cript or print, that have come out in the time of war or parliament, I have enclo&s;ed in a box which my brother Hammond will take up, it is &s;hipped in Mr. Clements, whom I have ordered to deliver them to you and pray you, after you have peru&s;ed them, to let my father have them for the u&s;e of friends; and were there any thing con&s;iderable that is not there I &s;hould add it, &s;aving the pre&s;aging of mens minds of &s;ome dangers of papi&s;ts and popery, and other things not fit for papers. The 2 nations are di&s;compo&s;ed as to the prorogueing of the parliament, e&s;pecially Scotland, where hath binn &s;ad jangling betwixt the Duke of Lauderdale and the nobility, which may i&s;&s;ue in di&s;quietments. I am, I ble&s;s God, well, with my wife, who pre&s;ents you and your lady with her &s;ervice, and &s;oe are all your relations. God hath binn afflicting our family here, having taken away lately my only daughter, and al&s;oe, as I hear, my relations there have had &s;ore breaches, the Lord &s;anctifye to them and me his holy hand. Since my la&s;t it hath plea&s;ed God to re|move by death Mr. Lodor, Mr. Venning and &s;ome other mini&s;ters of the pre&s;biterian per&s;wa&s;ion, holy men and much lamented; as al&s;oe lately Sir Thomas Temple, whom melancholy and griefe hath killed by his hard u&s;age

from Mr. Elliott, but e&s;pecially the occa&s;ion given of &s;can|dall by his lodging at his old Mrs. her hou&s;e, Mrs. Martin, which having heard the echo of again from New England, from the letters that &s;ome too uncharitably wrote, did &s;it deep upon his &s;pirit and ha&s;tened his end: He &s;ent for mee and I was with him &s;everall houres, before hee dyed a week, and hee layd open his &s;oul; it was a meer acci|dent, yea great nece&s;&s;ity, I judge, afterward that ca&s;t him at that wretches hou&s;e; hee did declare in the pre&s;ence of God, that noe temptation, noe not in a lu&s;t after her, had ever come upon his &s;pirit but contrarywi&s;e a great abhor|rence of it, was deeply afflicted that any had &s;oe much ag|grevated the report, and that the name of God &s;hould &s;uffer. I &s;aw neither di&s;ea&s;e nor paine that would ha&s;ten his end, but his &s;pirit broken, his inward e&s;tate darke, wherein God did enable mee to doe him &s;ome &s;mall &s;ervice. I hope he had the root of the matter in him and is gone home to re&s;t. Your concu&s;&s;ions you have at the colledge doe greatly grieve mee, and &s;oe much the more that noe friend hath binn plea&s;ed to give me a true &s;tate of it, but all I gather, from them that I &s;ee, are wholly of one &s;yde; it cau&s;eth a great rumour here, and is greatly ag|gravated to the pre&s;idents reproach, in whom I am con|cerned, for hee was a member with us, but it &s;eems hath joined him&s;elfe with the 3d church at Bo&s;ton, which &s;ur|prizeth me, although I doe judge his relation thereby to us is erazed, all that I would &s;ay is, that it hath by our New England friends here binn layd as a reproach upon all the elders, yet I think without cau&s;e; for if our letter bee viewed you will not find that wee did recommend him to bee your pre&s;ident, wee judged that too much for us to undertake, nor did wee excite him to come or urge him upon &s;uch hopes; it was his own eagre de&s;ire after it and his thinking that hee might bee &s;erviceable there; all wee &s;ayd was, that &s;ince hee was prepared to come wee thought him one that might bee helpfull in your colledge worke and left it with you to judge how; if there be any other expre&s;&s;ions, or to the like purpo&s;e of what I mention, they

Mr. John Richards and Mr. Peter Sergeant, to be im|proved for that worke. If you plea&s;e to advi&s;e with them and others, and find a way of certain improvement by buying lands, mortgages or other &s;ecurity, I am confi|dent the corporation may be inclined to goe in debt here to remitt a good &s;ome over. And indeed if you had my apprehen&s;ions of things you would endeaver it.</P>
<P>And now to returne to what I began with. I am per|&s;waded your country will afford good peter and it would be your advantage to make powder your&s;elves, and in the mean time to have a &s;tore by you, that you may not be in &s;traights, upon any &s;udden breach. I wi&s;h I may not be a prophet (as I have binn twice to &s;ome among&s;t you) in this, that I feare another warre. Upon which account, had I had the freedom of the di&s;po&s;e of the commodity, or that the country would have bought it now its cheape, I &s;hould have &s;ent a large &s;upply this yeare, but now for|beare untel I heare from you, and may then doe it, if the doar be open.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Mo&s;t dear and honored Mother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON the 23d July I received yours of the 29th March 1674, with the inclo&s;ed that &s;hould have come la&s;t year, hoping you have al&s;o by this time received mine of the 21&s;t May la&s;t, which informs you how it was then with my&s;elfe and your old friend Mr. R.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whaley.</NOTE> and that I wrote largely to your&s;elfe and dear Mrs. Jaines, in October la&s;t, which I perceive you have not received, which I am very &s;orry for; but it hath been a great mercy that all my former letters came &s;afely to your hands, and as for tho&s;e, know|ing the hazard of their mi&s;carriage by rea&s;on of the warres, I kept the coppyes of them, and for your further &s;atis|faction I have again tran&s;cribed, that you may &s;ee I was not unmindfull of my duty in writing to you and an&s;wer|ing your de&s;ire of my advice concerning my &s;i&s;ter Fr.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">His daughter Frances.</NOTE> of who&s;e di&s;po&s;all in marriage you have now given me the account, &s;o far as you conceive you could, and I believe are longing to under&s;tand my thoughts of it. Dear mo|ther, you are plea&s;ed to &s;ay well, that you gave me an account how it hath plea&s;ed the Lord to di&s;po&s;e of her, &amp;c. It is indeed the Lord, who is her heavenly father, that hath di&s;po&s;ed of her and provided this hu&s;band for her, and therefore, tho he be unknowne to me, I do believe he is the fitte&s;t per&s;on in the world for her, and that &s;he like|wi&s;e is the mo&s;t meet help for him. I remember in a former letter to your&s;elfe, when you de&s;ired my thoughts in a matter concerning her, I tould you I was confident the Lord would take care of her and in due time provide a hu&s;band for her, and now he hath done it, &s;hall I que&s;tion whether he hath done it well? No, I dare not do it. It is a great &s;atisfaction to me that you &s;ought the Lord, and tooke advi&s;e of our dear and chri&s;tian friends, and that my &s;y&s;ter was guided in her choy&s;e by your&s;elfe
<PB N="454" REF="011300_0230_0F86CBA202552330">
and them, and de&s;ire with you to ble&s;&s;e the Lord that hath provided &s;o well for her, and &s;hall not cea&s;e to pray night and day on their behalfe, that the Lord will be plea&s;ed to make them great ble&s;&s;ings to each other, and that this new condition may be, every way and allways, comfortable to them both, for as you very truely &s;ay, it will be as the Lord &s;hall be plea&s;ed to make it. I pray remember my mo&s;t tender and affectionate love to them both, and tell them that I greatly long to &s;ee them; but &s;ince that can|not be at pre&s;ent, you may a&s;&s;ure them that whil&s;t they &s;hall make it their great worke to love the Lord Je&s;us in &s;incerity, and love one another dearly for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, and to carry it with tender love and dutyfull re&s;pect to your&s;elfe, I &s;hall e&s;teem it my duty to love and pray, and act faith for them as if they were my own children, being not otherwi&s;e able at this di&s;tance to be helpfull to them. Dear mother, that your&s;elfe and all friends did &s;o well ap|prove the match gives much content to my heart, and I be&s;eech you not to give way to any recoylings that may ari&s;e in your own &s;pirit; do not &s;ay, as to the world, my &s;i&s;ter might have done much better, the Lord knowes what is be&s;t for us, and ours; it may be that which wee may think would have been better might have proved much wor&s;e. The&s;e are dying times, wherein the Lord hath been and is breaking down what he hath built, and plucking up what he hath planted, and therefore it is not a time to be &s;eekeing great things for our&s;elves. Let us read the 45th chap. of Jeremiah, and apply to our&s;elves what the Lord there &s;peakes to Baruch, and account it a great mercy if he give us our lives for a prey, and bring us again to &s;ee the faces one of another with comfort, The things, that Baruch is dehorted from &s;eeking, were worldly things, why then are they called great things? Surely the Lord &s;peakes it onely according to the e&s;teem that we are too apt to have of them, for the worlds great things are indeed and in truth but poor little things, and the &s;aints &s;hould looke down upon them with contempt, and &s;hew them&s;elves to be of high rai&s;ed &s;pirits, &s;eeking
<PB N="455" REF="011300_0230_0F86CBA202552330">
things truly great, as our Lord him&s;elfe doth exhort us, Mat. 6.33. But &s;eeke you fir&s;t the kingdom of God and his righteou&s;ne&s;&s;e, as if he had &s;aide, for they are great things, worthy your affectionate endeavours, and as for all the&s;e little things which gentiles &s;o earne&s;tly pur&s;ue, they &s;hall be added unto you &s;o far as your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of them. My poor &s;i&s;ter begins her hou&s;ekeeping at a time when trading is low, and all provi&s;ions dear, and I cannot but pitty her in that re&s;pect. I hope &s;he will not be di&s;couraged nor her hu&s;|band neither, but for prevention I de&s;ire them to con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly and to act faith upon that mo&s;t excellent councell our Lord delivered with authority in his &s;ermon on the mount, Mat. 6th from the 24th ver. to the end of the chapter. I cannot but be full of longings to heare how the Lord hath dealt with her in her lying in, but I doubt not you will take the fir&s;t opportunity to inform us of it, in the mean time I &s;hall endeavour to &s;tay my&s;elfe upon the promi&s;e made to childe-bearing women, 1 Tim. 2.15.</P>
<P>Dear mother, I have been hetherto congratulating my newly marryed &s;y&s;ter, but I mu&s;t now turn a&s;ide to drop a few tears upon the hear&s;e of her that is decea&s;ed, who&s;e lo&s;&s;e I cannot choo&s;e but lament with tears, and &s;o &s;hare with you in all the providences of God towards us; but my dear mother, let me not hereby be the occa&s;ion of re|newing your griefe, for I doubt not but you have grieved enough, if not too much, allready. Let us con&s;ider how graciou&s;ly the Lord deales with us (as for my dear &s;y&s;ter, &s;hee is got beyond our pitty, we need not lament for her &s;ake, but rather rejoyce that &s;hee is at re&s;t in the bo&s;om of Chri&s;t) who while&s;t he is taking from us with one hand, gives double with the other. He hath added one to your family on whom I hope you may &s;et that motherly affection as if he were your own &s;on, and I hope hath before this time al&s;o made you to rejoyce in the fruit of my &s;y&s;ters womb; and &s;hall not we &s;ay with Job, the Lord hath gi|ven, and the Lord hath taken, ble&s;&s;ed be the name of the Lord. But oh how apt are wee to murmur, if the Lord
<PB N="456" REF="011300_0231_0F86CBA369D8FF58">
do in any thing di&s;plea&s;e us, but what a &s;hame it were that we &s;hould be di&s;plea&s;ed at any thing which God doth? Who are wee, that wee &s;hould &s;et our corrupt wills in op|po&s;ition to his mo&s;t holy and ble&s;&s;ed will. It is ble&s;&s;ed coun&s;ell that a reverend mini&s;ter of the go&s;pell gives, who had been in the &s;choole of affliction, that I lately met with in a printed booke of his, I pray you (&s;aith he) drink in that notion, viz. That the will of God being pure, holy, perfect, yea God him&s;elfe, &s;hould not onely be &s;ubmitted to, or re&s;ted in, but loved and cho&s;en above all creatures, yea above life it&s;elfe, the be&s;t of creatures. Would wee but once learne this le&s;&s;on (which the Lord is, I hope, teaching of us by all his dealings with us) and help us (as you &s;ay &s;weetly in your letter) to &s;ee love in all his di&s;|pen&s;ations, there could nothing come ami&s;&s;e to us.</P>
<P>Dear mother, I perceive, when you wrote la&s;t, you were upon a remove from tho&s;e dear friends with whome you then &s;ojourned, I hope the Lord guided you to that mo|tion, and &s;hall long to hear where you &s;ettle; in the mean time, it is my comfort that the Lord tells all your wan|drings, and receives all your tears into his bottle, and will not faile to direct all your &s;teps, till he hath given you a &s;afe conduct through your weary&s;ome pilgrimage, and at the end thereof open unto you an abundant entrance into tho&s;e man&s;ions that are prepared for you in our fathers hou&s;e, where you &s;hall be at re&s;t in the bo&s;ome of Chri&s;t for ever.</P>
<P>Your old friend, Mr. R. is yet living, but continues in that weake condition of which I formerly have given you account, and have not now much to add. He is &s;carce capable of any rationall di&s;cour&s;e, his under&s;tanding, me|mory and &s;peech doth &s;o much faile him, and &s;eems not to take much notice of any thing that is either done or &s;aid, but patiently bears all things and never complaines of any thing, tho' I feare it is &s;ome trouble to him that he hath had no letter of a long time from his cozen Rich, but &s;peaks not one word concerning it, nor any thing you wrote of in your la&s;t, onely, after I had read your
<PB N="457" REF="011300_0231_0F86CBA369D8FF58">
letters to him, being a&s;ked whether it was not a great re|fre&s;hment to him to hear &s;uch a gracious &s;pirit breathing in your letters, he &s;aid it was none of his lea&s;t comforts, and indeed he &s;carce &s;peakes any thing but in an&s;wer to que&s;tions when they are put to him, which are not of many kinds, becau&s;e he is not capable to an&s;wer them; the com|mon and very frequent que&s;tion is to know how he doth, and his an&s;wer, for the mo&s;t part, is, very well, I prai&s;e God, which he utters with a very low and weake voyce; but &s;ometimes he &s;aith, not very well, or very ill, and then if it be further &s;aid, do you feele any pain any where, to than he allwaies an&s;wereth, no; when he wants any thing he cannot well &s;peake for it, becau&s;e he forgets the name of it, and &s;ometimes a&s;ks for one thing when he meanes another, &s;o that his eye or his finger is oftentimes a better interpreter of his mind than his tounge; but his ordinary wants are &s;o well known to us, that mo&s;t of them are &s;up|plyed without a&s;king or making &s;ignes for them, and &s;ome help he &s;tands in need of in every thing to which any motion is required, having not been able, of a long time, to dre&s;&s;e or undre&s;&s;e him&s;elfe, nor to feed, or ea&s;e nature either way, orderly, without help, and its a great mercy to him that he hath a friend that takes plea&s;ure in being helpfull to him, and I ble&s;&s;e the Lord that gives me &s;uch a good mea&s;ure of health and &s;trength, and an opportunity and a heart to u&s;e it in &s;o good and nece&s;&s;ary a worke; for tho' my help be but poor and weake, yet that ancient &s;ervant of Chri&s;t could not well &s;ub&s;i&s;t without it, and I do believe, as you are plea&s;ed to &s;ay very well, that I do enjoy the more health for his &s;ake. I have &s;ometimes wondered much at this di&s;pen&s;ation of the Lord towards him, and have &s;ome expectations of more than ordinary i&s;&s;ue; the Lord help us to profit by all, and to waite with patience upon him, till we &s;hall &s;ee what end he will make with us. Thus farr I write of my&s;elfe, I &s;hall now a&s;k him what he would have me to &s;ay to his friends concern|ing him. The que&s;tion being a&s;ked, he &s;aith, I am better than I was. And being a&s;ked what I &s;hould &s;ay more to

his cozen R. or any other friends, after a long pauze, he again &s;aide, the Lord hath vi&s;itted me in much mercy, and hath an&s;wered his vi&s;itation upon me. (I give it you in his own words.) Being de&s;irous to draw more from him, I propo&s;ed &s;everall que&s;tions and the &s;ume of his an&s;wers were, that he earne&s;tly de&s;ires the continuance of the fervent prayers of all his friends for him, and de&s;ires to be remembered to his cozen Rich and longs to receive a let|ter from her, and de&s;ires her to exhort her &s;on and daugh|ters, his dear cozens, to fear God, and to be remembered to her aunt at Chel&s;ey, praying that the Lord will requite all her great love, as al&s;o to be remembred to Mrs. Jaines and her good hu&s;band, to whom al&s;o he thinkes him&s;elfe greatly obliged for their great love, and in particular for Mrs. Jaines her care of poor Nol. de&s;iring her to continue the &s;ame; as al&s;o to be remembred to your&s;elfe, and wi&s;h|eth Frank much comfort in her new condition, and &s;aith he &s;hall not cea&s;e to pray for you and all yours. This is written on the 6th of Augu&s;t, but I know not when I &s;hall have opportunity to &s;end to Bo&s;ton, it may be there|fore before I &s;end away my letter I may have &s;omething more to add concerning him.</P>
<P>Thus far I proceeded ye&s;terday, but night coming on and having &s;omething el&s;e to do, I could proceed no fur|ther, and &s;o laid a&s;ide my paper, intending this morning to fini&s;h (if the Lord plea&s;ed) my an&s;wer to yours of the 29th March. But now my fir&s;t worke mu&s;t be to tell you that, thro' the great goodne&s;&s;e of God, I did al&s;o la&s;t night, after &s;upper, receive your welcome letter of the 8th of May (Franks birthday) wherein you let me know that you have al&s;o received mine of the 2d of October la&s;t, at &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on, which made it the more refre&s;hing to you, which is a great &s;atisfaction and comfort to me, for which I de&s;ire to ble&s;&s;e the Lord; but it would have been the more full if you had but &s;aid, with the inclo&s;ed to dear Mrs. Jaines, which I have lately tran&s;cribed, together with your owne, from the originalls, with a purpo&s;e to have &s;ent them with this, but I &s;hall &s;end neither, for I have good hopes that
<PB N="459" REF="011300_0232_0F86CBA561E58D20">
both were received, for I cannot but think when you com|plained that the dore of your hou&s;e was opened, if halfe of your goods had been taken away you would have made mention of it; for your own letter was both the hou&s;e and inventorie of all the goods contained in it.</P>
<P>Dear Mother, it is al&s;o a great comfort to me to hear that the Lord was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to appear on my dear &s;y&s;ters behalfe in the needfull hour, and de&s;ire with you to ble&s;&s;e the Lord for that great mercy, and I heartily thanke you for giving me &s;o quick a notice of it. Dear mother, it was likewi&s;e a great mercy that the Lord was plea&s;ed &s;o far to &s;atisfie your de&s;ire as to &s;hew you the fruite of her wombe and to make you the joyfull grandmother of a &s;on, and tho' it hath plea&s;ed the Lord &s;o &s;oon to tran&s;|plant him from the militant to the triumphant church, yet it may be a great comfort to your&s;elfe and my dear &s;y&s;ter, that from your wombs hath proceeded the increa&s;e to the mi&s;ticall body of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and reckon it a mercy that the Lord being purpo&s;ed to take him from you in his in|fancy, was plea&s;ed (that it might be the more ea&s;y to you) to do it before it had much time to take deep root in your affections, for I do believe the longer your&s;elves and his other relations had enjoyed him the harder it would have been to us all to have parted with him: But what &s;hall we &s;ay more? It may be &s;uch con&s;iderations as the&s;e are too &s;elfi&s;h, it is enough to compo&s;e the hearts of the children of God under every providence, to &s;ay, it is the Lord that hath done it, our loving and tender hearted infinitely wi&s;e Father hath declared his royall plea&s;ure, and it is our duty to &s;ub|mit to it, yea to rejoyce in it (for it is mo&s;t meet he &s;hould di&s;po&s;e of us and ours as &s;hall &s;eem good in his &s;ight) and to apply our&s;elves to learn the le&s;&s;ons he would teach us thereby, and among the re&s;t that is none of the lea&s;t which you mention, to get our hearts weaned from creature comforts and to live upon him&s;elfe as our all&s;ufficient &s;oul &s;atisfying portion; and let my dear brother and &s;y&s;ter re|member what the H.

I humbly thanke you for your motherly love and care for me, in your being &s;o de&s;irous to &s;upply my wants; and becau&s;e you are plea&s;ed to lay your com|mands upon me, I &s;hall make bould, when I need your help in that kind, to write to you for it. There is yet a little meale in the barrel and oyle in the crui&s;e. The greate&s;t thing I need is a heart to abide patiently in this condition untill it be expended. I cannot but account it a great mercy that in the&s;e hard times you &s;hould be able to be &s;o helpfull to your poor children; but I be&s;eech you let not your love to them make you to forget your&s;elfe, in parting with what is nece&s;&s;ary for your own comfort in your old age. Dear mother, you &s;ay you find nature greatly decaying in you, and therefore de&s;ire prayers that grace may be &s;trengthened, &amp;c. It cannot be otherwi&s;e expected but that as age comes on nature will decay; but I be&s;eech you pre&s;erve it what you can, and take heed of immoderate griefes, or what&s;oever el&s;e may be prejudiciall to your health, which you are able ta avoyde, and when you have done all you can, if you &s;till perceive the out|ward man peri&s;hing, yet faint not, for I do believe, through the faithfulne&s;&s;e of God, your inward man &s;hall be re|newed day by day, 2 Cor. 4.16.

yet I have and do enjoy a competent mea&s;ure of health and &s;trength, and beg your pardon if I have been too &s;low in acquainting you with and giving you the comfort of it. I thanke you for what you have written concerning tho&s;e relations I de&s;ired to heare of; and the rather becau&s;e you &s;ay you cannot write much, through the weakne&s;&s;e of your eyes, and I feare it may hurt them to read the&s;e long let|ters, for I de&s;ire you fir&s;t to reade and then &s;eale and de|liver the inclo&s;ed to my honored and dear friend D.

<P>Now, my dear mother, give me leave in a po&s;t&s;cript to be a little merry with you, and yet &s;erious too. There is one word in one of your letters that &s;ounds &s;o har&s;hly, and looks &s;o untowardly, that I cannot tell well how to read or looke upon it, and I know not how to write it, and yet I mu&s;t, though I cro&s;&s;e it out againe. I &s;up|po&s;e you do by this time &s;ufficiently wonder what will follow; but the matter is this, after you had given me a loving account of a bu&s;ine&s;&s;e wherein you have done your be&s;t, you were plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that if I &s;hould be

<HI>angry</HI> you had many to beare with you, &amp;c. Ra&s;h an|ger, I confe&s;&s;e, is a burthen that needs more &s;houlders than one to beare it; for Solomon &s;aith, a &s;tone is heavy and the &s;and weighty, but a fools wrath is hea|vier than them both. But oh, my dear mother, how could you feare &s;uch a thing from me? Your&s;elfe knoweth I never yet &s;pake an angry word to you, nay I hope I may &s;ay (without taking the name of God in vain) the Lord knoweth I never conceived an angry thought towards you, nor do I now, nor I hope never &s;hall, and in &s;o &s;aying I do not commend my&s;elfe, for you never gave me the lea&s;t cau&s;e, neither have you now, and I believe never will; therefore, dear mother, the whole prai&s;e belongs to your&s;elfe, or rather to the Lord, who, ble&s;&s;ed be his name, hath &s;o united our hearts together in love that it is a thing &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to be angry one with another. But I &s;hall now con|clude with a reque&s;t that you will not be angry with your&s;elfe for writing that word I have &s;poken &s;o much again&s;t, for I &s;uppo&s;e all your meaning was, if I &s;hould not alltogether approve of what was done, &amp;c. and I am abundantly &s;atisfied that the root from which that feare &s;prung was tender love, and that you &s;peake your heart when you &s;ay you love and honour me as much as ever, which may well increa&s;e my longings after you, for the exceeding grace of God in you. Now thankes be unto God for his un&s;peakeable gift. 2 Cor. 9.14, 15.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The remarkable circum&s;tances of two per&s;ons who had made &s;o con&s;iderable a figure in England will, I hope, excu&s;e the publi|cation of this long letter, altho' it has no immediate relation to the affairs of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets colony.</NOTE></P>

<P>BY yours of the 27 April 74, you give me to under|&s;tand that you have information from Mr. Peter Sergeant that the authority of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets prohibited him from &s;elling of your powder in his hand, and from thence claim ju&s;tice by the taking off the powder at the price he could have &s;ould it; I &s;hall not need but re|fer you to Mr. Sergeant, by whome the&s;e come, for the giveing you a more right under&s;tanding of what he wrote,

for I a&s;&s;ure you never any order pa&s;t for the re&s;traynning of him or any other to make &s;ale of that or any other &s;ort of goods, but the contrary, &s;ince upon the warre, an order pa&s;t that the &s;torekeeper &s;hould not deliver any but by order from &s;ome magi&s;trates; nor will Mr. Sergeant &s;ay that ever he had any denyal upon any de&s;ire for the deli|very of powder &s;ould by him; there was one bound for Guyny, that had bought of him twenty barrels and clan|de&s;tinely, contrary to law, &s;hipped it, &s;o that it was &s;eiza|ble by a law in force when you was in the&s;e parts; which powder, upon his petition, was &s;et at liberty, and he allowed to &s;hip off ten barrels, the other he privetly conveyed, &s;o that he carryed all away. At the &s;ame tyme the order before mentioned was given to the &s;torekeeper, there was an order i&s;&s;ued for the &s;everal townes to have their &s;tores fully &s;upplyed according to law, which quickened the de|mand of powder within our&s;elves; and the other collonyes under&s;tanding the order applyed them&s;elves for liberty to recruite their &s;tores, which was redily granted them, &s;o that the order pa&s;t by authority was noe ob&s;truction but a furtherance to tho&s;e that had of that commodity, both for quicknes of &s;ale and advance of price, and this I hope is &s;ufficient to rectifie your thoughts in that matter.</P>
<P>Sir, For the bu&s;ines of Mr. Gorges pattent, which was graunted, as by the date appeares, after the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets, &s;o that the juri&s;diction lyeth within the government there|of is without que&s;tion here; that there hath been &s;everal turnes therein is very true; but that there hath been any ju&s;t cau&s;e of complaint of the government of the Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;ets, I am per&s;waded that if the whole matter weare prepared noe indifferent judges would blame them for what hath beene done by them; yet, could there be a way hit upon to &s;top clamours it would be a &s;ervice to them. I am confident, and that upon good and rational grounds, had Mr. Gorges what he de&s;ires from the Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;ets he would not find the place turne to his profitt, but rather an addition to former lo&s;&s;e; and &s;hould any purcha&s;e his pretentions, in expectation of profitt, they

In order thereto, and you plea&s;e to treat with them concerned, that thereby you may under&s;tand what they claime and the grounds thereof, and what propo&s;al they will make, and give notice thereof, you &s;hould receive an&s;wer thereto; or might his preten|tions be bought off for five hundred pounds, and a&s;&s;urance given to take off all after claimes and claimers again&s;t the collony of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets or others upon the place, and you plea&s;e to ingage in it for the collony, I doe hereby oblige that the money &s;hall be ordered to be paid there, upon &s;uch a&s;&s;urance given. Concerning which I may not que&s;tion but that you will doe it by &s;uch advice as may be had, that it may &s;tand good in law, and for that, po&s;&s;ibly, you may meet with an opportunity that for pre&s;ent money more may be effected than by taking tyme, if you plea&s;e to di&s;bur&s;e it to the &s;um forementioned, I doe pa&s;s my word that you &s;hall be imbur&s;ed your money, with con&s;i|deration for the &s;ame. I &s;hould not have made thus bould with you in this matter, but from your loveing encourage|ment given by yours to me, and the confidence I have of that loveing re&s;pect you have to the peace and welfare of this place, and the churches of our Lord Je&s;us therein; de&s;iring that what I have wrote in this matter may be for your u&s;e and noe thing therein may be imparted to any that may &s;eeke occa&s;ion again&s;t the government thereby.</P>
<P>By yours of the 4th June, which came fir&s;t to hand (the other not coming to my hand until the 18th in&s;tant, Mr. Sergeant can give the rea&s;on) I perceive your mind is la|bouring for the publique good, your informations there|to I heartily thanke you for, and &s;hall in any thing to my power promote, for the Indian affaire with the commi&s;&s;io|ners or the other gentlemen.

<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY yours of the 24th of Augu&s;t I per&s;eave you judge my complaint about the powder was groundle&s;s: The rea&s;on you give me. For my applying to you, it was upon my cozin Sergeants informing me, as I then wrote, which he &s;till affirmes, and though he's loath to offend the government in &s;aying any thing now that he thinkes may not be acceptable, I thinke your owne excu&s;e, if weyed, &s;aith enough for me; for when 20 barrels ware &s;ould there was a great trouble to git a licence for 10, and the other ten privately carried away, which certainly hin|dred others from endeavouring to buy any to &s;end abroad, and that voyage, I know, might well have carried to ad|vantage ten times that quantity: And I a&s;&s;ure you, let the law be as aintient as it will, I will never (if I can help it) have my e&s;tate under &s;uch a re&s;traint, and had I known it would never have had a barrel in your collony. Yet the oldne&s;s of the law takes not off the equity again&s;t the new law to compell all into one &s;tore-hou&s;e, under your &s;tore|keeper,
<PB N="470" REF="011300_0238_0F86CBA9BB738B20">
and that he &s;hould deliver none but by the mage|&s;trates order; which is prejudiciall to its &s;ayle; for trade is a &s;eacret thinge, and when made publicke in the perticu|lers proves injurious to the concerned, but where &s;uch &s;u|pervi&s;ers will make it otherwi&s;e, and &s;oe, upon the whole, I am not &s;atisfied, but my fir&s;t demand is grounded upon rea&s;on, and &s;oe expect you &s;hould doe me ju&s;tice. The ca&s;e of peter I in&s;tanced in houlds good, for it was re|&s;trained by a law made before ours was imported, and yet his Maje&s;tie tooke ours off at the rate it would have yeild|ed, which is what you ought to doe for my powder. I am al&s;oe much di&s;&s;atisfied with my cozin Sergeants great charge of &s;tore-hou&s;e rome, 32<ABBR><HI>&s;.</HI></ABBR> per ton a year. It was a prudent ca&s;e to have powder at a di&s;tance from the towne, as here in the tower, but let the quantity be never &s;oe great that we lodge there, nothing is paid for it; &s;oe if you had laid it upon the countrys charge, or at lea&s;t a rea|&s;onable ware-hou&s;e rome, it might have bin excu&s;ed, but becau&s;e a private per&s;on, for a barrel or two, is willing, therefore to injoine for quantities, I thinke is not equall (though a factor may con&s;ent) which al&s;oe I leave with you for ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>For the bu&s;ine&s;s of Mr. Gorge I &s;hould willingly have di&s;bur&s;t the money you mention, but they are now in the clouds and expect as much a yeare, &s;ecured here, for their intere&s;t; the coppy of his, with others their petition, I gave Mr. Collins to &s;end you, and is heare inclo&s;ed. The councell of trade have don nothing, &s;oe its remanded to his Maje&s;ties prevy councell. As any thing pa&s;&s;eth (&s;oe far as I can learne) &s;hall advi&s;e you, but am of opinion that &s;ome pre&s;ents might be pla&s;te to the countrys advantage, and yet of noe great vallue.</P>
<P>As to what you write of the 26th of September, I am glad I could &s;ay &s;oe much to &s;ome of his Maje&s;ty's officers, yet I mu&s;t informe you that the paying the cu&s;tome in Virgina doth not priveledg any ve&s;&s;el to carry tobacco to any place but to the Engli&s;h plantations, and the gover|nor of the plantation where &s;uch tobacco is brought, if it
<PB N="471" REF="011300_0238_0F86CBA9BB738B20">
be againe exported, is bound to take bond to bring it for England. I &s;hould be &s;orry that his Maje&s;tie &s;hould have any ground of offence in this kind, for a little profitt to &s;ome particular per&s;ons, to be an occa&s;ion of depriveing the whole of their chiefe&s;t injoyments.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOURS by Mr. Sprague I received and de&s;ire to ble&s;s God for the tydings it brings of your health and your familye, and to bee &s;uitably affected with all other providential alterations the holy and wi&s;e God hath brought among&s;t you, wherein I humbly beg that poor country may hear the voice of the rod and who hath ap|pointed it. I &s;hall take things in order as I find them in your letter, that I may not omitt to an&s;wer all that is needfull. For Dr. Hoares concerne as to the colledge, I am very &s;orry that matters are &s;oe ill that nothing can heal that breach but his laying downe, and more that hee &s;hould put the over&s;eers to the utmo&s;t wayting for it, which I think very little prudence in him; by comparing report with report, letter with letter, I am almo&s;t con|founded in makeing a judgment of this matter; &s;ome &s;oe &s;evere as to lay all the blame on him and that not only of unmeetne&s;s for the place but &s;everal moral mi&s;carriages; others again wholly in charging one Mr. Graves and others of the fellows, and adding the emulation of &s;everal

expecting the preferment; your&s;elfe, with others mo&s;t ju|dicious, parting it betwixt both. I chu&s;e the medium to judge by; only methinks a pa&s;&s;age in your letter, more direct again&s;t him than any thing formerly, doth a little &s;tartle mee, at lea&s;t &s;oe far as to beg, in your next, a true account of it, namely his want of truth in his words. Pray Sir, if you judge him ju&s;tly culpable in that matter, let me privately know it, for hee is a member with us, if he re|turne. The enclo&s;ed coppy of the letter is, as far as I remember, ju&s;t as wee wrote it. My only concerne in this bu&s;ines is to &s;ympathize with the broken &s;tate of that once flouri&s;hing hou&s;e, to beg of God a revival of the worke and all el&s;e in which his glory is concerned in the mid&s;t of the yeares, and to mourne over that di&s;united &s;pirit among&s;t Gods people which appeares in this matter and all others; and what tokens of Gods di&s;plea&s;ure are but too evident with you; the Lord humble his people, par|don and heal the land. For the bu&s;ines of Mr. Dyers petition I know nothing of that in particular but, as I hope God hath &s;ent in Mr. Fo&s;ter, you will, by my letters, under&s;tand the &s;ame thing, in effect, which now I am able to give you an account of, as far as yet the affair hath gone. The enclo&s;ed petition will &s;hew you what they are about to put the King upon, a purcha&s;e of the propriety of the province of Main and Hamp&s;hire, and by whome tran&s;acted; hee that the King &s;hould buy it for is the Duke of Monmouth, though nothing as yet is determined; many complaints are made again&s;t you; they have thoughts of &s;ending a commi&s;&s;ioner thither, and it was determined to do it with &s;ome force, but their more weighty affaires and want of money will hardly admit this, I &s;uppo&s;e, this &s;ummer; but a letter from his Maje&s;ty you will have, to order &s;ome account of the&s;e things to bee given him, and I fear that which is aymed at is to call your patent to a &s;trict account, upon what termes you hold it; you would doe well to be in a preparation for it, e&s;pecially to make good your title to that part of your government. Here is none able to &s;peake for you, wee want in&s;tructions, papers that

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="inquiry">
<HEAD>Where the legi&s;lative and executive powers of the government of New England are &s;eated.</HEAD>
<P>The legi&s;lative power is &s;eated in a generall court, from which there is no appeal, con&s;i&s;ting at pre&s;ent of a gover|nor, deputy governor and 10 magi&s;trates, with the depu|ties of the &s;everall townes in that juri&s;diction, all which are yearely elected.</P>
<P>This court is the &s;upreme judicature of the colony, and only hath power to make lawes, rai&s;e money, and lay taxes upon the whole colony, di&s;po&s;e lands, give and confirme properties, impeach, &s;entence and pardon, and receave ap|peals from all inferior courts, and cannot be adjourned or di&s;&s;olved without the con&s;ent of the major part.</P>
<P>The governor, deputy governor and magi&s;trates are cho&s;en by the majority of the votes of the freemen of the colony, who are to attend at Bo&s;ton, either in per&s;on or by proxy, without any &s;ummons, the la&s;t Wedne&s;day in Ea&s;ter terme, and upon that day to con&s;ummate the elec|tion, which is done by writing the names in paper, but no

<P>The deputies for the generall court are cho&s;en by the freemen of every towne, who have all the power of the freemen transferred to them. No town can &s;end more than two deputies, and where a town hath but 20 freemen, that town can &s;end but one deputy, and when not 10 freemen the town &s;ends none; no per&s;on being an attor|ney is to be cho&s;en a deputy.</P>

It contains 20 chambers for &s;tudents, two in a chamber; a large hall, which &s;erves for a chappel; over that a convenient library, with &s;ome few bookes of the ancient fathers and &s;chool divines, but in regard divinity is the generall &s;tudy, there are many Engli&s;h bookes of the late non-conformi&s;t writers, e&s;pe|cially of Mr. Baxter and Dr. Owen. Here they teach Hebrew before they well under&s;tand Latin. No forma|lities or di&s;tinctions of habits, or other decencies, as in England, much le&s;&s;e the&s;e exhibitions and &s;upports for &s;chollars. They take no degrees above ma&s;ter of arts.</P>
<P>Their commencement, kept yearly the 2d of Augu&s;t, in the meeting-hou&s;e, where the governor and magi&s;trates are pre&s;ent, attended with throngs of illiterate elders and church members, who are entertained with Engli&s;h &s;peeches and ver&s;es. Mo&s;t of the &s;tudents are come for England, and at pre&s;ent no &s;ettled pre&s;ident, but one Mr.
<PB N="502" REF="011300_0254_0F86CD0C167D4360">
Oakes, a rigid independent, &s;upplies the place. The al|lowance of the pre&s;ident is 100<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> per ann. and a good hou&s;e. There are but 4 fellow&s;hips, the two &s;eniors have each 30<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> per ann. and the two juniors 15<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> but no diet is al|lowed: The&s;e are tutors to all &s;uch as are admitted &s;tu|dents. Mr. Thomas Graves, an ingenious and worthy per&s;on, was put by his fellow&s;hip, by the late Dr. Hoar, becau&s;e he would not renounce the church of England. The government of the&s;e colledges is in the governor and magi&s;trates of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets and the pre&s;ident of the colledge, together with the teaching elders of the &s;ix adjacent towns.</P>
<P>As to the colonies of New-Plymouth and Connecticot, it is humbly offered.</P>
<P>The lawes of England are there ob&s;erved with &s;uch of their own as are not contradictory thereunto. The oath of allegiance is taken by every magi&s;trate and officer, whe|ther civill or military, and by all freemen. All com|mi&s;&s;ions, proclamations, writs and &s;ummons are in his Maje&s;ties name.</P>
<P>The number of inhabitants in both colonies are computed to be 80000 &s;oules. There are noe &s;laves, only hired &s;ervants. The chief profe&s;&s;ions are farmers, gra&s;iers and fi&s;hermen. Very few merchants, they being &s;upplied with all forreign commodities from Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>The militia con&s;i&s;ts of 4 troops of hor&s;e and 5 regiments of foot, who are well armed and di&s;ciplined, no old &s;oldiers among them. The number fit to bear armes 20000.</P>
<P>The country is very fertile and plea&s;ant and abounds in corn and cattle, and produceth very good hor&s;es, the be&s;t in all N. E. which are &s;ent into &s;everall parts. There is great abundance of tarre and excellent good hemp, and there is made good quantity of whale oyle, which fi&s;h they take upon the coa&s;ts. The act of navigation is duely ob|&s;erved. No &s;tranger is admitted to come into their ports. They have no &s;hips of burthen, but only &s;mall ketches and barkes, to trade along the coa&s;ts and take fi&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="503" REF="011300_0254_0F86CD0C167D4360">They are generally very loyall and good people, and doe upon all occa&s;ions expre&s;&s;e great love to the per&s;on and government of his Maje&s;tie, and doe heartily wi&s;h that his Maje&s;ties authority were e&s;tabli&s;hed over the whole country.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent governor of New Plymouth is Jo&s;iah Win&s;low, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> a per&s;on eminently popular and beloved in all the colonies of N. E. and was generall of the united forces again&s;t the Indians.</P>
<P>The governor of Connecticot is Wm. Leet, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> a very worthy per&s;on, as are mo&s;t of the magi&s;trates of that colony.</P>
<P>The lo&s;&s;es which the&s;e colonies have &s;u&s;tayned by the Indian warre is e&s;timated to be near 100,000 pound.</P>
<P>This is (may it plea&s;e your Lord&s;hips) the be&s;t account I have been able to gather, during my &s;hort &s;tay in tho&s;e parts, as well from my own ob&s;ervation as from the information of others. And for what pa&s;&s;ed par|ticularly between the magi&s;trates of Bo&s;ton and my|&s;elf, upon the delivery of my letters, and with the inhabitants of that and the other colonies, I have pre&s;ented his Maje&s;tie with a &s;hort narrative.

<OPENER><SALUTE>May it plea&s;e your Maje&s;tie,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING receaved your Maje&s;ties letters for the go|vernor and magi&s;trates of your Maje&s;ties town of Bo&s;ton in N. E. dated 20th of March la&s;t, with my parti|cular in&s;tructions from the right hon. Mr. &s;ecretary Co|ventry, upon the 30th of the &s;ayd month I &s;ayled from the Downes. After a tedious pa&s;&s;age of 10 weeks arrived at Bo&s;ton on 10th June. At my landing I went immedi|ately to the governor John Leveret, and &s;hewed him your
<PB N="504" REF="011300_0255_0F86CD0C7A500A20">
Maje&s;ties pa&s;&s;e and acquainted him with the cau&s;e of my coming, and that I had brought a letter from his Maje&s;tie unto the magi&s;trates of that colony, and did therefore de|&s;ire him that, with what convenient &s;peed might be, the magi&s;trates might be a&s;&s;embled to hear your Maje&s;ties letter read. The governor an&s;wered, that the council was to meet that afternoon, upon other bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, and that then I &s;hould be &s;ent for; as I was, by the mar&s;hall of their court; where being come and admitted into the councill, I delivered your Maje&s;ties letters to the governor, there being &s;ix of the magi&s;trates and their &s;ecretary a&s;&s;embled with him, and there being a chaire placed purpo&s;ely for me, I was de&s;ired by the governor to &s;itt.</P>
<P>The governor having opened your Maje&s;ties letter &s;ayd to the re&s;t of the magi&s;trates, it was a letter from your Maje&s;tie, and looking to the bottom of the letter, he read by his Maje&s;ties command Hen. Coventry. The gover|nor a&s;ked me who that Mr. Coventry was. I told him he was your Maje&s;ties principall &s;ecretary of &s;tate.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the reading of your Maje&s;ties let|ter, the whole councill being covered, I put off my hat; whereupon three of the magi&s;trates tooke off their hats and &s;ate uncovered; but the governor with the re&s;t con|tinued to keep their hats on.</P>
<P>Your Maje&s;ties letters, with the inclo&s;ed petitions of Mr. Ma&s;on and Mr. Gorges, being read in my hearing, the governor told the councill that the matters therein contained were very incon&s;iderable things and ea&s;ily an|&s;wered, and it did no way concern that government to take any notice thereof. I acquainted them that your Maje&s;tie had commanded me to require an an&s;wer of your &s;ayd letters, and for which your Maje&s;tie had ordered me one month to attend. The governor an&s;wered, that they &s;hould con&s;ider of tho&s;e things. Whereupon I withdrew.</P>
<P>Then I delivered the particular letters of Mr. Ma&s;on, which he had writt unto &s;everall of the mo&s;t eminent in|habitants of Bo&s;ton, &s;ome whereof are the principall offi|cers of the militia. The&s;e gentlemen receaved me with
<PB N="505" REF="011300_0255_0F86CD0C7A500A20">
much kindne&s;&s;e and expre&s;&s;ed great loyalty to your Ma|je&s;tie. The letters he wrote were to give them an account of the contents of your Maje&s;ties letters, his own com|plaints again&s;t the proceedings of that government, with the occa&s;ion of my coming into the&s;e parts, de&s;iring them to communicate the &s;ame to others, the which was &s;oon &s;pread abroad, to the great plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction of all tho&s;e who are well-wi&s;hers to your Maje&s;tie.</P>
<P>Within a day or two after my arrivall, I met with a report which &s;eemed artificially ray&s;ed to amu&s;e and di|&s;tract the people about dome&s;tique troubles here in Eng|land, the &s;ume whereof was, that the Duke of Yorke, with diver&s;e of the nobility, upon di&s;content, had left the court, and had applied them&s;elves to the citty for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and that all was going to confu&s;ion at home. This was re|ported with much confidence, and &s;ayd to be writt from &s;ome very good people in London, and therefore mu&s;t be true. I &s;oon confuted this report, by many arguments, &s;hewing them the fal&s;ene&s;&s;e of it, and &s;o in a &s;hort tyme it vani&s;hed.</P>
<P>After two days con&s;ideration it was re&s;olved in their councell that thankes be returned to your Maje&s;tie for your gracious letter, and that an an&s;wer be forthwith &s;ent by a ma&s;ter of a ve&s;&s;el ready to &s;aile for London.</P>
<P>The 15th of June I was &s;ent for to the councell. The governour a&s;ked me whether I intended for London by that &s;hip that was ready to &s;aile, if &s;o I &s;hould have a du|plicate of their letter to your Maje&s;tie, the originall being to accompany his own particular an&s;wer to a letter he had receaved from Mr. &s;ecretary William&s;on by the &s;ame ma&s;ter of the &s;hip I came with. I told them I had other matters of concern under my charge, and &s;hould not return &s;o &s;oon, and withall a&s;ked them if they had well con|&s;idered of his Maje&s;ties letter and the inclo&s;ed petition in &s;o &s;hort a time, and concluded on their agents and the time of their going for England, to which they gave me no reply, but the governour a&s;ked me if I had any thing fur|ther to offer them from your Maje&s;tie, I told them I had
<PB N="506" REF="011300_0256_0F86CD13883EF640">
nothing further to communicate to them, whereupon the governor &s;aid that he looked upon me as Mr. Ma&s;on's agent, and that I might withdraw.</P>
<P>The day after, I went to vi&s;it the governour at his hou&s;e, and among other di&s;cour&s;e I told him I tooke notice of &s;everall &s;hips that were arrived at Bo&s;ton, &s;ome &s;ince my being there, from Spain, France, Streights, Canaries and other parts of Europe, contrary to your Maje&s;ties lawes for encouraging navigation, and regulating the trade of the plantations. He freely declared to me that the lawes made by your Maje&s;tie and your parliament obligeth them in nothing but what con&s;i&s;ts with the intere&s;t of that colony, that the legi&s;lative power is and abides in them &s;olely to act and make lawes by virtue of a charter from your Ma|je&s;ties royall father, and that all matters in difference are to be concluded by their finall determination, without any appeal to your Maje&s;tie, and that your Maje&s;tie ought not to retrench their liberties, but may enlarge them if your Maje&s;tie plea&s;e, and &s;aid, your Maje&s;tie had confirmed their charter and all their privileges by your Maje&s;ties letter of the 28th of June 1662, and that your Maje&s;ty could doe no le&s;&s;e in rea&s;on than let them enjoy their liberties and trade, they having upon their own charge and without any contribution from the crown made &s;o large plantation in the wilderne&s;&s;e, and that during the Dutch warrs your Maje&s;tie &s;ent ammunition to New-Yorke for that place, but &s;ent them word they mu&s;t &s;hift for them&s;elves and make the be&s;t defence they could, and that notwith&s;tand|ing the colony had many enemies, yet they did believe your Maje&s;tie to be their very good friend, for that your Maje&s;tie had by &s;everall letters expre&s;&s;ed your great kind|ne&s;&s;e to them.</P>
<P>Within a few days after I met with one Mr. Harris, a gentleman who arrived there from England about &s;ix months before, who told me that at his arrival at Bo&s;ton, he was, according to their law, conducted to the governor, which enjoins all ma&s;ters of ve&s;&s;els to bring all pa&s;&s;engers to the governor upon penalty of 20<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> who enquiring of
<PB N="507" REF="011300_0256_0F86CD13883EF640">
him if he knew Mr. Ma&s;on and whether he was coming over and what commi&s;&s;ioners were coming with him, Mr. Harris told him there was a report that Mr Ma&s;on was to come over. The governor then &s;aid he had re|ceaved information from England that commi&s;&s;ioners had come over la&s;t &s;ummer or the &s;pring, but that your Maje&s;|tie had not money to defrey that charge and &s;et them forth, and did therefore beleave no commi&s;&s;ioners would come.</P>
<P>The 23d June I gave in a memoriall to the governour, the councill being then a&s;&s;embled at his hou&s;e, wherein I acquainted them that in pur&s;uance of my in&s;tructions I did remind then of your Maje&s;ties command of &s;ending over agents that might be &s;ufficiently qualified and im|powered, and did de&s;ire that &s;eeing a generall court &s;eemed much more proper for di&s;patch of matters of &s;o great and weighty concerns, that a generall court might on this oc|ca&s;ion be a&s;&s;embled, that &s;o I might receave their delibe|rate and &s;olemn an&s;wer to your Maje&s;ties letters, for the which I would attend. But hereunto they gave me no other an&s;wer then that when I was ready to &s;aile for Eng|land I &s;hould have a coppy of their letter which they had writ unto your Maje&s;tie.</P>
<P>About the beginning of July, I went into the province of New-Hamp&s;hire, belonging unto Mr. Ma&s;on, but now divided by the Bo&s;toneers into three counties, and by them called Norfolk, Suffolk and Middle&s;ex. And travailed through &s;everall of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable towns, acquaint|ing the inhabitants with the occa&s;ion of my coming into the country, and read Mr. Ma&s;on's letter unto them, which gave them great &s;atisfaction, the whole country complaining of the oppre&s;&s;ion and u&s;urpation of the magi&s;trates of Bo&s;ton, impo&s;ing mini&s;ters upon them, not admitting them to the &s;acrament of the Lord's Supper, denying bapti&s;m to their children, and liberty of choo&s;ing their own magi&s;trates and officers becau&s;e they were not members of their con|gregations. And as a farther marke of their power and &s;overeignty over them they &s;end twice a year magi&s;trates from Bo&s;ton to keep courts for trying of cau&s;es, and that
<PB N="508" REF="011300_0257_0F86CD1513F6E2B8">
they lay at plea&s;ure what impo&s;itions, fines and taxes they thinke fit upon their e&s;tates, per&s;ons and trade, contrary to the lawes of England, and that they have been for a long time earne&s;tly expecting to be delivered from the govern|ment of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets Bay, and doe now humbly hope your Maje&s;tie will not permitt them any longer to be op|pre&s;&s;ed, but will be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to give them relief, according to the promi&s;es made them by your Maje&s;ties commi&s;&s;ioners in 1665, who were then in that province, and declared them not to be under the government of Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>And being at Port&s;mouth, a town of very great trade, lying upon the river of Pi&s;cataway, in the northermo&s;t part of New-Hamp&s;hire, about &s;eventy miles from Bo&s;ton, &s;everall of the principall inhabitants of the province of Main, belonging unto Mr. Gorges, and now by the Bo&s;|toneers, &s;ince the &s;eizing thereof, called York&s;hire, came unto me making the &s;ame complaints, with tho&s;e of New-Hamp&s;hire, entreating me to repre&s;ent their condition to your Maje&s;tie and are pa&s;&s;ionately expecting relief, &s;ome of them having been &s;uffered to be ruined by the Indians for having formerly expre&s;&s;ed their duty to your Maje&s;tie when your Maje&s;ties commi&s;&s;ioners were in that country, and for having taken commi&s;&s;ions from them to act as ju&s;tices of the peace.</P>
<P>At my return to Bo&s;ton I receaved a me&s;&s;age from Jo&s;iah Win&s;low, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> governor of your Maje&s;ties colony of New-Plymouth, de&s;iring I would give him a vi&s;it before I left New-England. Whereupon I made a journey to him, whome I found a gentleman of loyal principles and hath &s;hewed him&s;elf a per&s;on of great courage and conduct in the management of the Indian warre, tho&s;e barbarous people being chiefly overcome by his conduct and troops, which makes him to be feared and not loved by his neigh|bours the Bo&s;toners.</P>
<P>In his di&s;cour&s;e he expre&s;&s;ed his great di&s;like of the carriage of the magi&s;trates of Bo&s;ton to your Maje&s;ties royall per&s;on and your &s;ubjects under their government;
<PB N="509" REF="011300_0257_0F86CD1513F6E2B8">
of their incroaching upon the rights, trades and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the neighbouring colonies, laying what rates they plea&s;e on the commodities and products of the other colonies imported into their harbours; the dayly breach of your Maje&s;ties lawes concerning trade and navigation, trading with and incouraging all nations &s;o trade with them, to the great prejudice and detrement of your Maje&s;tie and this your kingdom: And that he, finding the inconve|niences of a divided government dayly ari&s;ing, did &s;ay, that New-England could never be &s;ecure, flouri&s;h, nor be &s;er|viceable to your Maje&s;tie, untill the &s;everall colonies and plantations were reduced under your Maje&s;ties immediate government, and that the colonies of New-Plymouth and Connecticot would readily and willingly &s;ubmitt to your Maje&s;ties plea&s;ure and commands in the di&s;po&s;all and &s;et|tlement of the civill government.</P>
<P>That during my &s;tay at Bo&s;ton I made acquaintance with &s;everall of the chief inhabitants and &s;ome of the magi&s;trates, and did particularly informe my&s;elf of the humour, di&s;po&s;ition and affections of the people, and found the principal inhabitants, &s;ome whereof are the chief offi|cers of the militia, and the generality of the people com|plaining of the arbitrary government and oppre&s;&s;ion of their magi&s;trates and doe hope your Maje&s;tie will be plea&s;ed to free them from this bondage by e&s;tabli&s;hing your own royall authority among them and govern them according to your Maje&s;ties lawes. And many of the better &s;ort did intreat me to repre&s;ent this their condition to your Maje&s;tie, not daring publickly to expre&s;&s;e their de&s;ires or complaint by petition, becau&s;e of the &s;everity and arbitrary proceeding of their rulers, and that many of them have been &s;ufferers for petitioning formerly. Altho' at the general court in Octob. 1666, upon occa&s;ion of your Maje&s;ties letter and declaration of the 10th Aprill in the &s;aid year, which petition was &s;ub&s;cribed by upwards of 100 of the principall inhabitants of that colony, wherein they did a&s;&s;ert your Meje&s;ties right of juri&s;diction and &s;o|veraignty over them, a copy whereof is hereunto annexed,
<PB N="510" REF="011300_0258_0F86CD16B1EA9850">
being given me by &s;ome of the chief per&s;ons that had &s;ub|&s;cribed it, de&s;iring that your Maje&s;tie might &s;ee the &s;ame; the&s;e gentlemen &s;oe delivering this petition, did then re|ceave a &s;evere check, the petition voted &s;candalous, they &s;tiled the betrayers of the libertyes of that colony and ill-affected to that government, for which &s;ome of them have been greatly prejudiced in their e&s;tates and fortunes, and &s;till lye under many inconveniences, and are not admitted into any offices of the government or choyce of the ma|gi&s;trates.</P>
<P>Being ready to return for England, the tyme allotted by your Maje&s;tie being expired, I went to the governor on the 20th July, for my di&s;patches, and was entertained by him with a &s;harp reproof for publi&s;hing the &s;ub&s;tance of my errand into tho&s;e parts, contained in your Maje&s;ties letters, as al&s;oe in Mr. Ma&s;ons petition and what he re|pre&s;ented to his friends there, with that of Mr. Gorges unto the inhabitants of Bo&s;ton, New-Hamp&s;hire and Main, telling me that I de&s;igned to make a mutiny and di&s;tur|bance in the country and to withdraw the people from their obedience to the magi&s;tracy of that colony and the authority thereof. I told him, if I had done any thing ami&s;&s;e, upon complaint made to your Maje&s;tie he would certainly have ju&s;tice done him.</P>
<P>The governor then gave me the duplicate of a letter directed unto the right honorable Mr. Secretary Coven|try, which he told me was the an&s;wer which the councill thought fit to give to your Maje&s;ties letters, the originall being &s;ent for England a month before.</P>
<P>At my departure from him, both he and &s;ome of the magi&s;trates, &s;everally, intreated me to give a favourable report of the country and the magi&s;trates thereof, adding, that tho&s;e that ble&s;&s;ed them God would ble&s;&s;e, and tho&s;e that cur&s;ed them God would cur&s;e. And withall, de&s;ired me to acquaint your Maje&s;tie that whatever reports were ray&s;ed again&s;t them, by wicked and evill minded men, to draw away your Maje&s;ties grace and favour from them, yet they were a people truely fearing the Lord and very obe|dient to your Maje&s;tie.</P>
<P><PB N="511" REF="011300_0258_0F86CD16B1EA9850">So that altho' by your Maje&s;ties command I was &s;ent to the magi&s;trates of Bo&s;ton, and was named in your royall letters as one who &s;hould &s;ollicit a fit determi|nation in the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e depending, and bring back the an&s;wer thereof, yet I mu&s;t wholly refer my&s;elf to their own an&s;wer, they not having thought fit to acquaint me with the contents thereof.</P>

<P>The receaving a charter from his Maje&s;ties royall pre|dece&s;&s;or for the planting of this colony, with a confirma|tion of the &s;ame from his royal per&s;on, by our late addre&s;&s;e &s;ufficiently declare this place to be part of his dominions, and our&s;elves his &s;ubjects, in te&s;timony of which al&s;o our fir&s;t governour Mr. Mathew Cradock, as we are informed, &s;tands recorded <HI>juratus de fide &amp; obedienti&acirc;</HI> before one of the ma&s;ters of chancery, whence it is evident that if any proceedings of this colony have given occa&s;ion to his Ma|je&s;tie to &s;ay that we beleave he hath no juri&s;diction over us, what effectual cour&s;e had need be taken to free our|&s;elves from incuring his Maje&s;ties farther di&s;plea&s;ure, by continuing in &s;o dangerous an offence, and to give his Maje&s;tie all due &s;atisfaction in that point? Such an a&s;&s;er|tion would be no le&s;&s;e de&s;tructive to our welfare than de|rogatory to his Maje&s;ties honour. The doubtful interpre|tation of the words of a patent, which there can be no rea&s;on to beleeve can ever be con&s;trued to the dive&s;ting of a &s;overaign prince of his royall power over his naturall &s;ubjects and liege people, is too frail a foundation to build &s;uch a tran&s;cendent immunity and privilege upon.</P>
<P>Your petitioners &s;hall ever be willing to acknowledge to the utmo&s;t how much they are bound to your&s;elves and others in the like capacity for your abundant care and paines in carrying on they government of this colony and endeavouring to uphold the liberties thereof, and &s;hould not be unwilling to run any hazard with you for the re|gular defence and &s;ecurity of the &s;ame, and would be mo&s;t unwilling to reflect upon the per&s;ons of them they &s;o much honour and re&s;pect, by a nece&s;&s;ary di&s;&s;enting from them in &s;ome things wherein they could not approve the

<P>They earne&s;tly de&s;ire, that no party will &s;o irre&s;i&s;tably carry on any de&s;ign of &s;o dangerous con&s;equence as to ne|ce&s;&s;itate their brethren, equally engaged with them in the &s;ame undertaking, to make a particular addre&s;&s;e to his Maje&s;tie and declaration to the world to clear them&s;elves from the lea&s;t imputation of &s;o &s;candalous an evill, as the appearance of di&s;affection, or di&s;loyalty to the per&s;on and government of their lawfull prince and &s;overaign would be.</P>
<P>Wherefore your petitioners doe humbly intreat, that if any occa&s;ion hath been given unto his Maje&s;tie &s;o to re|&s;ent any of your former actions, as in his la&s;t letter is held forth, that nothing of that nature be further proceeded in, but contrawi&s;e that application be made to his Maje&s;tie by meet per&s;ons immediately to be &s;ent for that end, to clear the tran&s;actions of them that govern this colony from any &s;uch con&s;truction, lea&s;t otherwi&s;e that, which duly im|proved, might have been as a cloud of the latter rain, be turned into that which in the conclu&s;ion may be more ter|rible than the roaring of a lyon.</P>

<P>THERE comes with this another letter to your&s;elfe from mee, which Mr. Raw&s;on will give you, with that which your committee here for the colledge hath &s;ent to the over&s;eers. There is one Mr. Smith, I think his name is &s;oe, an expert &s;urveyor, who hath built forty of the&s;e famous hou&s;es in London, though he be a &s;tranger to my&s;elfe, yet hath the commendations of eminent mini|&s;ters for his goodnes, be&s;ides &s;ome of the chiefe workmen in the city for his ability in his calling.

<P>Sir, there is another trouble which I pre&s;ume to putt upon you, which is, to &s;peak to the reverend Mr. Higgin|&s;on, pa&s;tour of Salem, to move that congregation to doe &s;omething for the maintenance of Mrs. Peters,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Widow of Hugh Peters.</NOTE> who, &s;ince her hu&s;band &s;uffered here, hath depended wholly upon Mr. Cockquaine and that church whereof he is pa&s;tour.

<P>TRUSTY and well beloved, Wee greet you well. The&s;e our letters are to accompany our tru&s;ty and well beloved William Stoughton and Peter Bulkley, E&s;qrs. your agents, who having manife&s;ted to us great nece&s;&s;ity in their dome&s;tick concernes to returne back into New-England, Wee have graciou&s;ly con&s;ented thereunto, and the rather becau&s;e, for many months pa&s;t, our councill hath been taken up in the di&s;covery and pro&s;ecution of a popi&s;h plott, and yet there appears little pro&s;pect of any &s;peedy lea&s;ure for entring upon &s;uch regulation in your affaires as is certainly nece&s;&s;ary, not only in re&s;pect of our dignity but of your owne perfect &s;ettlement. But it is very probable that if either your &s;aid agents had brought commi&s;&s;ion to intermeddle in &s;uch regulation (which they have di&s;owned) or that you had &s;ent &s;uch commi&s;&s;ion after them, when, from time to time, intimations were given them of what wee did expect, and what wee were thereupon willing to grant, neither their &s;tay had been thus long, nor had the matter now been undetermined.

<P>There is one thing which wee cannot omit to let you know wee are &s;urprized at, which is, that during the time wee had the complaints of Mr. Gorges under our con&s;ideration, you &s;hould pre&s;ume, without a&s;king our royall permi&s;&s;ion, to purcha&s;e his intere&s;t in the province of Maine, the truth whereof is but lately owned by your &s;aid agents, when almo&s;t at the &s;ame time wee come to heare of &s;ome effects of a &s;evere hand layd by you on our &s;ubjects there in con&s;equence thereof.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Articles of high mi&s;demeanour exhibited again&s;t a faction in the generall court, &s;itting in Bo&s;ton, 15 Feb. 81. viz. again&s;t Tho. Danforth, Dan. Gookin, Mr. Salton|&s;tall, Sam.

By Edward Randolph, collector, &amp;c. of his Maje&s;ties cu&s;toms in New-England.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">I. THAT the &s;aid faction, the governor not con&s;ent|ing thereto, have refu&s;ed to publi&s;h his Maje&s;ties proclamation of the 24th of November in the 23d year of his reign, &s;ent by his Maje&s;ties &s;pecial command, and received by this government in October 1680, which en|forceth the act made in 25th year of his Maje&s;ties reign.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="527" REF="011300_0266_0F86CD1DEDD6E8B8">II. The &s;aid faction have refu&s;ed to declare and admit of his Maje&s;ties letters pattents bearing date at We&s;tmin&s;ter 15th October, in the 33d year of his reign, erecting an office of collector, &amp;c. of his Maje&s;ties cu&s;toms in New-England, and of the powers granted to his Maje&s;ties offi|cer by the &s;ame, tho' often pre&s;&s;ed thereunto, in the gene|rall court, by the governour, Major Dudley and &s;everall of the magi&s;trates of the colony.</P>
<P N="3">III. The &s;aid faction have refu&s;ed to pay me &s;everall &s;ummes of money which I was forced to depo&s;it in court before I could proceed to triall of cau&s;es relating to his Maje&s;ty's concerns, by virtue of an order of court made October 1. 1681, no law of this colony directing the &s;ame, though by his Maje&s;ty's royall letters of Octob. 21. 1681, they are particularly required thereunto.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The &s;aid faction, under pretence of &s;atisfaction of his Maje&s;ty and regulating the trade of this colony, in op|po&s;ition to the &s;aid officer of collector of his Maje&s;ty's cu&s;toms, have confirmed the place and powers of the col|lector of the cu&s;toms and impo&s;ts laid upon wines and &s;trong waters imported into their colony, &s;et up by a law made in their colony in 1645, their pre&s;ent navall officer, having been chiefe collector of the&s;e dutyes above a yeare before this navall office was ordered, as by their law, navall office, doth appeare.</P>
<P N="5">V. The &s;aid faction continue to exerci&s;e the power of governor and court of a&s;&s;i&s;tants, which, through the inad|vertency of former governors, the court of deputyes have a&s;&s;umed, to heare, repeale and determine in civill cau&s;es, which, for want of education and being under no particu|lar oath, they are uncapable to manage: &s;o that by their numbers outvoting the governor and court of a&s;&s;i&s;tants, his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects greatly &s;uffer in their e&s;tates, and be&s;ides, there is no &s;uch power granted them in their charter.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The &s;aid faction have neglected to repeale all laws of their colony contrary to the laws of England, though required thereunto by his Maje&s;ty's letters of 28th of Feb. 1662, and the ob&s;ervance thereof promi&s;ed by their agents

Al&s;o their laws eccle|&s;ia&s;ticall continued, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="7">VII. The &s;aid faction have refu&s;ed to admit of his Maje&s;ties letters pattents beating date at We&s;tmin&s;ter 19th of May in the 32d year of his Maje&s;ty's reign, granted to William Blathwait, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> erecting an office of &s;urveyor and auditor generall of his Maje&s;ties revenues ari&s;ing in America, and do appropriate to them&s;elves the fines, for|feitures, &amp;c. which appear by the &s;aid letters pattents to belong to his Maje&s;ty, and they make the condition of all recognizances and penall bonds payable to the trea&s;urer and not to the King.</P>

<P>HIS Maje&s;ties great goodnes and favour in giving us a farther opportunity to attend him in the affaires of this his colonie expre&s;&s;ed in his gracious letter of  <GAP DESC="blank">  wee with mo&s;t humble thankfulnes acknow|ledge.

<P><PB N="529" REF="011300_0267_0F86CD21AE0B8578">Upon the receipt of his Maje&s;ties &s;aid letter (though at a &s;ea&s;on, in regard of the extremity of the cold and &s;now, very difficult for the members, e&s;pecially tho&s;e remote, to a&s;&s;emble in) the governour forthwith &s;ummoned a gene|ral court; which being met January 4th and his Maje&s;ties letter communicated with all duty and regard, the contents thereof were taken into &s;erious con&s;ideracion.</P>
<P>And, in the fir&s;t place, wee applyed our&s;elves to the choi&s;e of agents that they might have timely notice and, accordingly, &s;o prepare them&s;elves for that &s;ervice as to be ready to imbarque upon the fir&s;t opportunity.</P>
<P>Wee con&s;idered of in&s;tructions for them, wee carefully peru&s;ed our whole booke of lawes, pur&s;uant to the excep|tions made to &s;ome of them by Mr. Atturny and Sollicitor generall when our late agents were attending his Maje&s;tie and their information given us, &s;ince their returne home, wherein wee have made a con&s;iderable progre&s;&s;e towards a conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>But &s;o it is, right honourable, that wee find it no ea&s;y matter to prevaile with per&s;ons, in any degree qualifyed, to undertake &s;uch a voyage at this time; and though &s;e|veral elections have been made, wee have not as yet ob|tain'd the con&s;ent of any.</P>

<HEAD>Copy of a Letter from Edward Randolph to the Bi&s;hop of London.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my attendance on your Lord&s;hip, I often expre&s;t that &s;ome able mini&s;ters might bee appoynted to per|forme the officies of the church with us. The maine ob|&s;tacle was, how they &s;hould be mainetayned. I did for|merly, and doe now propo&s;e, that a part of that money &s;ent over hither and pretended to bee expended among&s;t the Indians, may be ordered to goe towards that charge. I am told by credible per&s;ons that there is nigh two thou|&s;and pounds of that money put out to intere&s;t in this country, I know two hundred hath bin for many yeeres in the hands of Mr. Raw&s;on, their &s;ecretary, who is now pre&s;&s;ed for to pay the money, to his utter ruin. Nece&s;&s;ity, and not duty, hath obliged this government to &s;end over two agents to England; they are like to the two con&s;uls of Rome, Ce&s;ar and Bibulus. Major Dudley is a great op|po&s;er of the faction heere, again&s;t which I have now arti|cled to his Maje&s;ty, who, if he finds things re&s;olutely man|niged, will cringe and bow to any thing; he hath his for|tune to make in the world, and if his Maje&s;ty, upon alte|ration of the government, make him captain of the ca&s;tle of Bo&s;ton and the forts in the colloney, his Maje&s;ty will gaine a popular man and obleidge the better party.</P>
<P>But if, whatever I have &s;aid and proved again&s;t, and even confe&s;&s;ed by their former agents, their money rai&s;ed upon the mi&s;erable inhabitants &s;hall &s;till prove a prevailing argument, and the agents be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed before every mat|ter concluded in England bee certified to bee duly and punctually ob&s;erved heere, you will render them more capable to oppo&s;e his Maje&s;tys authority.</P>
<P>I have rea&s;on, from &s;uch great pre&s;&s;ing rea&s;ons to pay in this 200<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> to believe that this money is a banke layd up heere upon mannaging &s;ome publick de&s;igne. There was
<PB N="532" REF="011300_0269_0F86CD2845E03A08">
a great difference betwixt the old church and the members of the newchurch, about bapti&s;me and their members joyn|ing in full communion with either church; this was &s;oe high that there was impri&s;oning of parties and great di&s;tur|bances, but now, heereing of my propo&s;als for mini&s;ters to be &s;ent over, for they have very good corre&s;pondancy with &s;ome of the clarks of the councell, they are now joyned together, about a fortnight ago, and pray to God to con|found the devices of all who di&s;turbe their peace and li|berties. I have made it an article again&s;t them, for not repealing their lawes eccle&s;ia&s;ticall, and &s;ent in my papers to Mr. Blackworth a large account of their latter tran&s;ac|tions, to which I humbly be&s;eech your Lord&s;hip to be referred and to be pre&s;ent at the committys making a party again&s;t their great friend L. P. S. who cannot with&s;tand their weighty arguments. They have bin this 3 yeeres rai&s;ing money for this expedition, their la&s;t agents ex|pended above 4000<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> in their agency, the poore people mu&s;t pay all, for by their law neither magi&s;trates, mini|&s;ters or any publick officers are charged with any publick rate. The&s;e agents have certaynly one great advantage by my ab&s;ence, haveing liberty to &s;ay what they plea&s;e; but I thinke I have &s;o cleerly layd downe the matter of fact, &s;ent over their lawes and orders to confirme what I have wrote, that they cannot deny them; however, if commanded, I will readily pa&s;s the &s;eas to attend at White|hall, e&s;pecially if Danford, Goggin and Newell, maje&s;trates, and Cooke, Hutchin&s;on and Fi&s;her, members of their late generall court and great oppo&s;ers of the hone&s;t governor and maje&s;trates, be &s;ent for to appeare before his Maje&s;ty, till which time this country will always be a &s;hame as well as inconveniency to the government at home. Your Lord|&s;hip hath a great pledge for &s;uch mini&s;ters as your Lord|&s;hip &s;hall thinke convenient to &s;end over, for their civell treatment, and I thinke no per&s;on &s;itter than Major Dudley, their agent, to accompany them, who will be very carefull to have them &s;ettled as ordered in England. He is one of the commi&s;&s;ioners for the money &s;ent over for
<PB N="533" REF="011300_0269_0F86CD2845E03A08">
the converting the Indians; I give him two or three lines to recommend him to your Lord&s;hips favour, &s;oe far as he may bee &s;erviceable to the de&s;igne; as for Capt. Richards, he is one of the faction, a man of meane extraction, com|ing over a poore &s;ervant, as mo&s;t of the faction were at their fir&s;t planting heere, but by extraordinary feats and cou&s;&s;inadge have gott them great e&s;tates in land, e&s;pecially Danford, &s;o that if his Maje&s;ty doe fine them &s;ufficiently, and well if they e&s;cape &s;oe, they can goe to worke for more. As for Mr. Richards, he ought to be kept very &s;afe till all things tending to the quiett and regulation of this government be perfectly &s;ettled. I give your Lord|&s;hip my humble thankes for the great pre&s;ent of excellent bookes. I have di&s;po&s;ed of them to advantage and, with my wife, are cryed out upon as di&s;turbers of the peace of the churches, for bringing in damnable bookes. We have in Bo&s;ton one Mr. Willard, a mini&s;ter, brother to Major Dudley, he is a moderate man and bapti&s;eth cho&s;e who are refu&s;ed by the other churches, for which he is hated. My Lord, we heere the &s;laves in Algier are all to be re|deemed, that I bouldly write itt that the &s;ettlement of this country and putting the government into the hands of hone&s;t gentlemen, &s;ome or which are already in the maje|&s;tracy, and di&s;countenancing utterly the faction, will be more gratefull to us, for now our conciences as well as our bodys are in captivity to &s;ervants and illiterate plan|ters. My Lord, your goodnes and readines to &s;erve his Maje&s;ty in the &s;ettlement of this great plantation, invites me, upon all occa&s;ions, to interpo&s;e your Lord&s;hips more weighty affayres, but &s;ince wee are heere immediately un|der your Lord&s;hips care, I with more freedome pre&s;s for able and &s;ober mini&s;ters, and wee will contribute largely to their maintenance, but one thing will mainely helpe, when no marriages heereafter &s;hall be allowed lawfull but &s;uch as are made by the mini&s;ters of the church of England.

<SALUTE>Right honourable,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Wrote your Lord&s;hip largely by Mr. Foy, which I hope is come to your Lord&s;hips hands. Our agents are &s;ayled from hence about a fortnight ago. Wee heare, Maj. Dudley, one of them, is very &s;ick of a feavor and not like to hold out the voyage, Mr. Richards, the other, one of Danforths faction and a great oppo&s;er of the governor, will, upon Maj. Dudleys death, have an opportunity to &s;ay what he plea&s;eth, in defence of the &s;everall mi&s;demeanors objected again&s;t them and their faction.</P>
<P>They have been the&s;e 2 yeares ray&s;ing money upon the poore inhabitants, to make friends at court, certainly they have &s;ome there, too nigh the councill chamber, otherwi&s;e they could not have coppies of my petition again&s;t their government, my articles of high mi&s;demeanures again&s;t Danforth, and now of Mr. Cranfields in&s;tructions and ne|gotiations in the province of New-Hamp&s;hire.</P>
<P>I heartily congratulate the happy returne of his Royall H. my gracious ma&s;ter, to Whitehall, the news whereof and of his Maje&s;ties bringing quo warrantos again&s;t &s;everal charters in England, and of Mr. Cranfields being con&s;tituted
<PB N="535" REF="011300_0270_0F86CD29CD67D2E0">
governor of New-Hamp&s;hire, puts the faction in a great perplexity; their generall court hath &s;ett above a month, and made only the inclo&s;ed law, and appointed a fa&s;t throughout the government. I am confident, if his Ma|je&s;tie had bene plea&s;ed, at the &s;ame time he made Mr. Cran|field governor, to bring a Q. W. again&s;t their charter and made him governor of this collonie, they would thanck|fully receive him, e&s;pecially upon declaring liberty of con|&s;cience in matters of religion; but &s;o long as their charter remaines undi&s;turbed, all his Maje&s;tie &s;aith or commands &s;ignifies nothing here. The governor is very much trou|bled that the faction will not hearken to rea&s;on; he en|deavoured to have their navall office (&s;ett up in oppo&s;ition to my letters pattents) taken away this generall court, and have all the acts of parliament relating to trade declared and publi&s;hed, but the faction are re&s;olved to doe nothing to oblige the governor or an&s;wer his Maje&s;ties expecta|tions. His Maje&s;ties quo warranto again&s;t their charter and &s;ending for Tho. Danforth, Sam. Nowell, a late factious preacher and now a magi&s;trate, and Dan. Fi&s;her and Eli&s;ha Cooke, deputies, to attend and an&s;wer the articles of high mi&s;demeanures I have now exhibited again&s;t them, in my papers &s;ent Mr. Blaithwait per Capt. Foy, will make the whole faction tremble. I was very much threatned for my prote&s;t again&s;t their navall office, but it was at a time when they heard of troubles in England; but, &s;ince, I am very ea&s;y, and they would be glad to heare no more of it. His Maje&s;tie commanded them to repay me the money they tooke from me by their arbitrary orders, which the faction would not heare of, I have therefore arre&s;ted Mr. Danforth for 10<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> part of that money, and their trea&s;urer, Mr. Ru&s;&s;ell, for 5<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> due to me for a fine, and I am to have a tryall with them. I humbly be&s;eech your Lord&s;hip that I may have coe&s;ideration for all my lo&s;&s;es and money laid out in pro&s;ecuting &s;eizures here, in the year 1680. If I may not have it out of his Maje&s;ties trea&s;ury in England, that the heads of this faction here may be &s;trictly pro&s;ecuted and fined for their trea&s;ons and mi&s;demeanures, and my
<PB N="536" REF="011300_0271_0F86CD2A8DD45050">
money paid out of their fines. My Lord, I am at a great di&s;advantage, by rea&s;on of my di&s;tance from court, and in no condition to &s;ollicite his Maje&s;ties concernes and the good and wellfare of this colony, as formerly, I well re|member, bu&s;ine&s;s with your Lord&s;hip, as with other Lords of the councill, &s;ometimes intervenes, which hath occa|&s;ioned not only delays but quite alters the face of things, e&s;pecially when a committee of Lords meete, who are not acquainted with the whole &s;eries of this affaire: It is there|fore my humble reque&s;t to your Lord&s;hip to move that 2 or 3 committyes may be appointed for this matter, when your Lord&s;hip, my Lord Hide, and Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer, may be pre&s;ent, and the whole matter of fact examined and &s;tated. I know the agents, at lea&s;t one of them, will confe&s;s what is charged upon their government, as their former agents did, in their petition to his Maje&s;tie, which is a &s;tanding evidence again&s;t them; but if that be not &s;ufficient ground to avoid their charter, together with the mi&s;demeanors charged upon them, on which your Lord&s;hip hath the opinion of Sir Wm. Jones, if his Ma|je&s;tie plea&s;e to direct Gov. Cranfield to examine the la&s;t articles again&s;t the faction, there will be rea&s;on not only to vacate their charter but to &s;end over a prudent gentleman to be generall governor. If the party were &s;o con&s;idera|ble as to revolt, upon his Maje&s;ties re&s;olution to &s;ettle this plantation (as hath been &s;ometime &s;ugge&s;ted) their fir&s;t worke would be to call me to account, for endeavouring, openly, the alteration of their con&s;titution, which by their law is death, but they dwindle away and are very much divided, magi&s;trate again&s;t magi&s;trate, the one hoping, the other fearing a change. My Lord, I have but one thing to reminde your Lord&s;hip, that nothing their agents can &s;ay or doe in England can be any ground for his Maje&s;tie to depend upon: Be plea&s;ed to remember, from the time your Lord&s;hips honorable father, the late Lord Chancellor, engaged with their agents, in 1662, who undertooke and a&s;&s;ented to every thinge his Lord&s;hip propo&s;ed for his Maje&s;ties honour and the benefit of his &s;ubjects here in|habiting,
<PB N="537" REF="011300_0271_0F86CD2A8DD45050">
nothing but open contempt, of all his Maje&s;ties commands, with &s;mall eva&s;ions and tricks, have followed, and wor&s;e may be daily expected, if it be left to them to regulate the abu&s;es complained of. My Lord, one un|happy (if not willfull) mi&s;take hath very much promoted the&s;e mi&s;chiefs, his Maje&s;tie hath been repre&s;ented to this people very low in his trea&s;ury, unable and unwilling to give them any di&s;turbance, though never &s;o much pro|voked to it, which is here believed, when to this day their contempts putt upon his Maje&s;ties commi&s;&s;ion and com|mi&s;&s;ioners in 1664, his Maje&s;tie not calling them to account for refu&s;ing to &s;end over Bellingham and Hathorne, when commanded upon their allegiance to attend at Whitehall by his Maje&s;ties letter of 1666, no not &s;o much as the lea&s;t notice taken of it in any of his Maje&s;ties letters at any time &s;ince to this government, and on the other hand, by a certain <HI>deceptio vi&s;us,</HI> the&s;e people have been repre&s;ented to his Maje&s;tie as a very dutifull and loyall people, that they are a great people and can rai&s;e great forces, be&s;ides that they have been at va&s;t charges and expences in &s;ub|duing a wilderne&s;&s;e and making a great country, without any charge or expence to the crown. Its true there are many loyall &s;ubjects here, but few of them in any places of tru&s;t. Their forces are very incon&s;iderable, more for &s;hew than &s;ervice. I will engage with 500 of his Maje&s;ties guards to drive them out of their country. And for their expences, I know very few now living, nor their children, who were at that charge. Mr. Dudley, one of the pre&s;ent agents, was one of the fir&s;t planters and a gentleman, came over with a good e&s;tate, but the fir&s;t adventurers are either all dead and their children drave out of all, by their fathers &s;ervants, or el&s;e &s;o few and incon&s;iderable that no notice is taken of them; and as for all the per&s;ons joyned and con|cerned in the faction here, I know but one man who was not a &s;ervant or a &s;ervants &s;on, who now governe their governor and the whole country.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is a &s;candalous mi&s;repre&s;entation, unle&s;s he intended to &s;ave him&s;elf by &s;uppo&s;ing the governor and the whole country to be governed by a few, only, of tho&s;e again&s;t whom he had ju&s;t be|fore exhibited articles of high mi&s;demeanor.</NOTE> I be&s;eech your Lord|&s;hip

<SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Gave your Lord&s;hip the trouble of mine of 29th of May la&s;t, which I hope is long &s;ince received. Wee have advice by Capt. Barrett, now arrived from London, that your lord&s;hip hath remembered us, and &s;ent over a mini&s;ter with Mr. Cranfield, the very report hath given great &s;atisfaction to many hundreds who&s;e children are not baptized, and to as many who never, &s;ince they came out of England, received the &s;acrament. I wrote your

lord&s;hip of our two agents coming over to attend and re|ceive his Maje&s;ties commands, they have large commi&s;|&s;ions to promi&s;e as much as any of their former agents, and have credit for large &s;umes of money to purcha&s;e (if they can) what their promi&s;es cannot obtaine, but I hope nothing will be concluded upon, and they thereupon per|mitted to returne home, till his Maje&s;tie have full a&s;&s;u|rance from governor Cranfield that all things are here duly performed which are expected and commanded to be done in this collonie. But nothing will &s;o effectually &s;et|tle this government on a firme dependence upon the crowne as bringing a quo warranto again&s;t their charter, which will wholly di&s;inable many, now, great &s;ticklers and promoters of the faction among us from acting further in a publick &s;tation, e&s;pecially tho&s;e again&s;t whom I have ex|hibited the inclo&s;ed articles &s;ent in my la&s;t to Mr. Blathwait.</P>
<P>My Lord, I am at a great di&s;tance and &s;o not able per&s;onally to attend and &s;ollicite in this affaire as for|merly, but in regard the matter is more ea&s;y to be effected, I thinke it unnece&s;&s;ary, yet in regard its ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for his Maje&s;ties &s;ervice and advantage to the crown to have the whole plantation &s;ettled upon the true ba&s;is of duty and allegiance, I had rather take a voyage to England, if commanded, to make out my alle|gations, than to have this matter pa&s;&s;ed over and hur&s;ht up upon bare pretences and promi&s;es. I confe&s;&s;e my particular bu&s;ine&s;&s;e is to take care of the trade of this country, I dayly expo&s;e my&s;elfe to many hazards and troubles, but all I have done or can project is to little purpo&s;e, &s;o long as this government (now &s;ufficiently di|vided) which the lawes of England enjoyne to my aide and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, are parties and chiefe ob&s;tructers of my de&s;igns, for till this government be thoroughly regulated, all that his Maje&s;tie commands will &s;ignify nothing. This inde|pendency in government claimed and daily practi&s;ed by us is one chiefe occa&s;ion of the many mutinies and di&s;tur|bances in other his Maje&s;ties forreigne plantations. If wee are mi&s;informed concerning your lord&s;hip's &s;ending
<PB N="540" REF="011300_0273_0F86CD2BFB75FC20">
over a mini&s;ter, be plea&s;ed to commi&s;erate our condition, and &s;end us over a &s;ober di&s;creet gentleman. Your lord|&s;hip hath now good &s;ecurity, &s;o long as their agents are in England, for his civill treatment by the contrary partie; he will be received by all hone&s;t men with hearty chri&s;tian re&s;pects and kindne&s;s, and if his Maje&s;ties lawes (as none but fanaticks que&s;tion) be of force with us, wee could rai&s;e a &s;ufficient maintenance for divers mini&s;ters out of the e&s;tates of tho&s;e who&s;e trea&s;ons have forfeited them to his Maje&s;tie. I have wrote to the Earl of Clarendon, to Mr. &s;ecretary Jenkins, to remind them of the many &s;mall eva|&s;ions and tricks putt upon his Maje&s;tie and the lords of the councill by this incon&s;iderable faction, who&s;e &s;o long delayed puni&s;hment and reformation, invites and incou|rageth to greater contempts. I que&s;tion not but your lord&s;hips un&s;potted loyalty to his Maje&s;tie, and charitie to us his dutifull &s;ubjects, will now engage your lord&s;hip timely and vigorou&s;ly to a&s;&s;i&s;t, &s;o to reduce this faction, as to put it ab&s;olutely out of their power to attempt the like for the future. Our mini&s;ters hope God will &s;upport them in all their extravagancies, and now wee have a &s;ol|lemne fa&s;t ordered to intreate the Lord to give our agents favour in the eyes of the King, and with all they are to be concerned. Serjeant Maynard, his Maje&s;ties &s;erjeant at law, hath made a pre&s;ent of eight che&s;ts of books, now &s;ent over to the colledge at Cambridge, by Capt. Barrett, and con&s;igned them to Capt. Richards, one of the agents &s;ent to England. They are valued at above 400<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> I finde his marrying Mr. Bantries neece will oblige him to &s;tand up for the good old cau&s;e, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t the agents, who a|mong&s;t other matters, are to repre&s;ent me as an enemie to this government, and an open di&s;turber of their peace.

<HEAD>Copy of a Letter from Mr. Edward Randolph to Mr. Jo&s;eph Dudley.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have yours of Sept. 10th by me and am now to give you the news of your charter being vacated, by judg|ment, for non-appearance. His Maje&s;ty has cho&s;en Coll. Kerke, late governor of Tangier, to be your governor. He is a gentleman of very good re&s;olution and, I believe, will not faile in any part of his duty to his Maje&s;ty nor be wanting to doe all good offices for your di&s;tracted colony, if, at la&s;t, they will hear what is rea&s;on and be governed. Here was &s;ent over a mo&s;t &s;candilous paper, preached, as tis &s;aid, by Mr. Moody and Mr. Mather; the Duke of Yorke hath a copy of it, and others have coppies al&s;o; twill doe your country great prejudice and put jealou&s;ies into the minde of the councel here, as if the collony would not abide by the judgment again&s;t their charter, but &s;tand up to defend their liberties. My bu&s;ine&s;s has been and &s;hall be to ward off as much as I can. And if, by the iniquity and folly of your mini&s;ters and maje&s;trates, you faile of what was expected, the whole blame will re&s;t upon them&s;elves. The King &s;ent me over to Holland, to in|quire after the irregular traders; 3 or 4 had been there, and they were gone before my coming. I returned back a fortnight after judgment was given and would have been glad to have &s;een Sir Edmund Andrews in England, who is yet in Guern&s;ey. I que&s;tion not but you will have reports, as if a great fleet of &s;hips, with regements of hor&s;e and foote, are coming again&s;t you, but I know of no &s;uch thing, only, I believe, a frigott or two will attend the go|vernor, who is leftenant of one of his Maje&s;ties regiments of guards and one of the bed chamber. I remember what you advi&s;e, that the government be, in the fir&s;t place, tran&s;po&s;ed and committed to the care of fitting per&s;ons upon the place to prepare and accommodate affairs again&s;t the arrival of the governour. I am not wanting to pre&s;s for liberty of con&s;cience and confirmation of all your rights and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and have nominated, according to what was
<PB N="543" REF="011300_0274_0F86CD2CC28A73A0">
agreed betwixt you and my&s;elfe, per&s;ons for the councill, and di&s;&s;wade all I can from rai&s;ing any rates upon the peo-to &s;upport government, more than what has been u&s;ual with you. The King has been plea&s;ed to make me &s;ecretary and regi&s;ter of New-England. I have nominated you for the King's receiver generall of all New-England, which will be a place of profit. I had other things to propo&s;e on your behalfe, but that mu&s;t attend a farther opportuni|tie. Re&s;pects to the governor and his lady, madam Taylor, Mr. Stoughton, Mr. Bulkeley, Mr. Page and his lady, and all friends. Its yet very uncertain whether proce&s;&s;e will i&s;&s;ue out again&s;t Rhode I&s;land and Connecticut collony to bring in both them before the governour come over, or to do that afterward in ca&s;e they refu&s;e to &s;ubmit to a gene|ral governour, as yet nothing has been di&s;covered of it. A committee of Lords but &s;aturday next is appointed for that bu&s;ines. Dr. Cox is well and &s;o is Mr. Boyl and all your friends, among&s;t whom I de&s;ire to be recorded, becau&s;e I am Sir,</P>

<P>PURSUANT to his Maje&s;tyes order in council of the 13th July 1685, directing Mr. Attourney Generall to cau&s;e writs of Quo Warranto to be brought again&s;t the charters of the colonys of Rhode I&s;land and Connecticot in New England, I accordingly &s;erved the&s;e writts, tho' by a tedious pa&s;&s;age of almo&s;t 6 months from London to this place, the time of their returne was lap&s;ed. However, the governor of Connecticott, upon my delivering the writt to him at Harford, on 21&s;t in&s;tant, has appointed a meet|ing of the generall courte of that colony to be called to|gether to &s;urrender their charter to his Maje&s;tie, if not per&s;waded by the factious people (who are unwilling to depend on his Maje&s;ties favour) to &s;tand a triall, only to gain time and delay his Maje&s;ties &s;ending over a generall. Upon my delivering the governor of R. I&s;land the &s;ummons of the writt, he a&s;&s;embled the freemen, and they have drawne a petition and addre&s;s to be forthwith humbly pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;tie.</P>
<P>I intended, long before this time, humbly to lay before your Lord&s;hips a more early account of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of this government, but have forbore, to wait the effect his Maje&s;ties gracious commi&s;&s;ion and con&s;titution of govern|ment, containing libertie of con&s;cience, would have upon
<PB N="545" REF="011300_0275_0F86CD2D79B0A188">
the people of this colony, which, at my fir&s;t arrivall, was received with all outward &s;hew of &s;atisfaction and a com|pliment of gratitude was returned his Maje&s;ty for that favour; but &s;ince, the proceeding of the governor and councill, whatever they write or pretend in their letters to their Lord&s;hips, are managed to the incouragement of the independant faction and utter di&s;countenancing both the mini&s;ter and the&s;e gentlemen and others who dare openly profe&s;s them&s;elves to be of the church of England, not making any allowance for our mini&s;ter, more than we ray&s;e by contribution among&s;t our&s;elves. The frame of this government, only, is changed, for our independant mi|ni&s;ters flouri&s;h, and expect to be advi&s;ed with in publick affaires. I need no further arguments to confirme the truth hereof to your Lord&s;hip than to &s;ay, but two of the pre&s;ent members of the government, viz. Mr. Ma&s;on and my&s;elfe, are members of the church of England, that of above 60 officers in the militia of the whole government, there are not above 2 captains, or 3 inferior officers, but are either church members or &s;uch as con&s;tantly frequent tho&s;e meetings, which makes nonconformi&s;ts from all places re&s;ort there. About 2 months agoe Mr. Morton, an ex|communicated mini&s;ter, came hither from Nuington green; he was welcomed by our pre&s;ident and de&s;igned to be ma&s;ter-head of our colledge, but not daring to proceed, at fir&s;t, by &s;uch large &s;teps, he is called to be mini&s;ter at Charle&s;towne, a very good liveing, and is ready at hand to be pre&s;ident of the colledge.</P>
<P>Two brothers, of the name of Baylie, great and daring nonconformi&s;ts at Lymbrick in Ireland, have been here 2 yeares and well provided for. In the time of Mon|mouths rebellion, mo&s;t part of the mini&s;ters animated the people, &s;aying the time of their deliverance was at hand, and not one of them prayed for his Maje&s;tie, nor would give credit to his Maje&s;ties mo&s;t gracious letter, &s;ignifying the overthrow of the rebells. I humbly propo&s;e, as great|ly for the quiet and wellfare of this plantation of New-England, that no mini&s;ter from England be permitted to
<PB N="546" REF="011300_0276_0F86CD2FC2055968">
land without the licence of the generall governour, and that he have power or licence to re&s;train from preaching &s;uch as are already upon the place. From all which it will appear very nece&s;&s;ary that his Maje&s;ty would be gra|ciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to &s;end over to us a generall governour, to unite and &s;ettle this di&s;tracted country, and al&s;o to make good what is already begun in this colony, the delay where|of may be of evil con&s;equence and give way for the factious people here to rea&s;&s;ume the government, which they openly declare they have not parted withall, but expect an opportunity to be re&s;tored.</P>
<P>And as to the di&s;charge of that tru&s;t repo&s;ed in me, I humbly repre&s;ent to your Lord&s;hips, that under his Ma|je&s;ties authority the pre&s;ident takes great liberty to injoyne upon me in my &s;tation, and would not a&s;&s;i&s;t me to make a &s;ei|zure of a ve&s;&s;el in the harbour, which my officers were not permitted to board. I am by all accounted the foule enemy of the country, having been for 11 yeares attending his Maje&s;ties command in this affaire, and by &s;erving the writts upon the other colonies, my life may be made very unea&s;y, unle&s;s his Maje&s;ty &s;hall be plea&s;ed graciou&s;ly to recommend me to the care and protection of his generall governour, for who&s;e &s;peedy arrivall all good men hear|tily pray.</P>

<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>INCLOSED is a letter &s;ent &s;ome time &s;ince from the government of Road I&s;land, they call it a &s;urrender of their charter. I have &s;ince the receipt of it called on them in my way to Hartford in Connecticott, the governor tells
<PB N="547" REF="011300_0276_0F86CD2FC2055968">
me they will pa&s;s a &s;urrender in fuller tearmes under the &s;eale of their colony, but are willing to have this &s;ent. I was with the governor of Connecticott and delivered to him the quo woranto. I &s;uppo&s;e they intend not to &s;tand it out, our councill have &s;ent Major Pincheon and Capt. Winthrop to Hardford to per&s;wade them to accommodate the matter, &s;o as they may be added to the government here; how farr that will prevaile I know not; they are &s;en|&s;ible of Mr. Dudleyes encroachment on all and every &s;ide, and are unwilling to tru&s;t him, and are &s;trongly invited to come under New Yorke, but it is more for the publick advantage to have that colony continued to us. Since my goeing to Hartford, the pre&s;ident has &s;o contrived the matter that Capt. George has received above two hundred pounds mony which legally belongs to me who, as collec|tor and informer, ought to be admitted to pro&s;ecute a &s;hip laden with Scotch goods, but its all as Capt. George plea&s;es, the pre&s;ident and he carry all as they plea&s;e, to the greate di&s;&s;attisfaction of the members of the councill, that now in|&s;tead of meeting to do publick bu&s;ine&s;s, tis only to quarrill and that in &s;uch heats that I feare it will occa&s;ion the de|&s;olving this government. I am forced to moderate others pa&s;&s;ions (tho' I have mo&s;t cau&s;e to complaine) and quietly to &s;uffer my proffitts to be &s;hared out among&s;t others till Sir Edmund Andros come over; he is longed for by all &s;ober men who find them&s;elves abu&s;ed by the fal&s;e pre&s;ident. Mr. Wharton is comeing over our agent, I have offered Mr. Ma&s;on at lea&s;t to be joined with him, but I think I cannot gett it to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>There will I fear be an eruption betwixt the French of Nova Scotia and our people in Mayne and New Hamp|&s;hire, occa&s;ioned by Capt. Palmer and Mr. We&s;t of New Yorke, who being at the fort of Pemmequid and haveing advice of a &s;hip of Pi&s;cattaqua which landed wine at Ponop|&s;cutt belonging, as they &s;ay, to Nova Scotia, they by force went a&s;hoar and took of the wine: I referr you to the inclo&s;ed, a copie of Mr. Palmers letter: The gover|nor of New-Yorke I am told has given them directions to
<PB N="548" REF="011300_0277_0F86CD309585FE98">
claim all the land as farr ea&s;tward as the River St. Croix. We have &s;ent to all places to warne our people and to the fi&s;hermen, not to venter upon their coa&s;ts, lea&s;t they be &s;urprized, and made to an&s;wer for damages done by &s;tran|gers. Ju&s;t now I have received a letter from my good friend Mr. Chaplin, who acquaints me of your happy recovery from a dangerous &s;ickne&s;s, for which I returne hearty thancks to allmighty God. Mr. Stoughton is inclined to the nonconformi&s;t mini&s;ters, yet &s;tands right to his Maje&s;|tyes intere&s;t. Mr. U&s;her is made a great criminall for in|forming again&s;t Moody and Allin, who are &s;tirring up the people to rebellion, he is a ju&s;t hone&s;t man, and will not &s;ee his Maje&s;tyes intere&s;t &s;uffer. But we are over voted and cannot help our &s;elves till Sir Edmund come to regulate the matter. Sir, I am under great difficultyes, and were it not for my ingagement in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the ma&s;ts, I would once more make a journey over, for I am treated by Mr. Dudly wor&s;e than by Mr. Danforth, yet all under the pretence of friend&s;hip, and is angry that I do not believe him. Hone&s;t Major Buckly is quite tyred out and can hardly be per&s;waded to come to Bo&s;ton. This is our pre&s;ent di&s;tracted condition. Wee have only patience and our friends a&s;&s;i&s;tance to depend upon in England for redre&s;s.</P>
<P>I remaine, Sir, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Sir, I am informed that the land wheron the wine was landed have been allwayes deemed to belong to the French and was the very place formerly belonging to Sir Thomas Temple, and was delivered up to the French upon the articles of Breda by Capt. Wibourne, by his Maje&s;ty's &s;pe|ciall command, in exchange for the Engli&s;h plantation on St. Chri&s;tophers and that done about the yeare 1667.</P>
<P>Sir, Some of the members of the councill are of opi|nion that &s;ince the con&s;titution of this government is by a pre&s;ident and councill, who united are all but governor, that therefore they ought to have a proportionable &s;hare of the profitt as well as the charge and burthen, haveing not one penny comeing to them as members of the councill more then to any ju&s;tice of the peace; &s;ome &s;tay here five

or &s;ix weeks together and neglect their own bu&s;ine&s;s, and have nothing to defrey their ordinary charges, be&s;ides lo&s;s of time, which they have de&s;ired me to repre&s;ent and pray your opinion thereupon, as al&s;o whether the pre&s;ident is <HI>virtute officii</HI> the ordinary to grant admini&s;trations and to allow the probate of wills, he producing no authority from his Maje&s;ties lords of the councill, or from my lord of London.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>May it plea&s;e your Grace,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have forborne riteing to your grace till I had been &s;ome time upon the place, to &s;ee how the poore peo|ple here would demean them&s;elves under this new govern|ment. At my fir&s;t arrivall I met with outward expre&s;&s;ions of joy and &s;atisfaction, and many &s;eemed well plea&s;ed at the change, having been &s;truck with a panicke feare upon the aprihention of Colonel Kurcks coming hither to be theire governor; but finding a commi&s;&s;ion directed to a gentleman borne among them&s;elves, the then governor and companie, growing hardie by theire mini&s;ters, began to per&s;wade Mr. Dudlie not to except of his Maje&s;ties com|mi&s;&s;ion to be pre&s;ident, hoping thereby to continue the government among them&s;elves: But that faileing them, they adjourned the meeting of their generall a&s;&s;embly to the &s;econd of October next, and &s;o broke up with hopes, that either &s;ome unhappie accident in affairs of &s;tate at home, or by di&s;&s;ention rai&s;ed by their artifices among the members in this new government, they might prevaile &s;o far as to di&s;&s;olve this new con&s;titution and then rea&s;&s;ume the government, which to accompli&s;h they are &s;oli&s;&s;itou&s;e. I take leave humbly to remind, that when your grace was pre&s;ent at a committee of the Lords and was therein plea&s;ed to move, that one of theire meeting hou&s;es in
<PB N="550" REF="011300_0278_0F86CD327676B020">
Bo&s;ton &s;hould be ordered to be &s;et apart for the exerci&s;e of the religion according to the church of England, it was then an&s;wered by &s;ome of tho&s;e noble Lords who di&s;cor&s;ed in theire favour, provided they might have libertie of con|cience in matters of religion, they would voluntarilie &s;ub|mit to have one of theire three meeting hou&s;en to be di&s;|po&s;ed of by the pre&s;ident and councell, for that u&s;e. Since my arrivall with Mr. Ratcliffe, a &s;ober man, recommended by my Lord of London to be our mini&s;ter; who, be&s;ides his Lord&s;hips faire te&s;timonials, brought with him a letter from the right honourable the Lords of the committe for trade and foraine plantations to the pre&s;ident and councell for their countenance and incouridgement in the di&s;charge of his office; yet twas a long time before they tooke the lea&s;t notice of him or his bu&s;ines; at la&s;t, though &s;trongly oppo&s;ed, I got a little roome in their towne hou&s;e, for &s;uch as were for the church of England to a&s;&s;emble in, but found it &s;o &s;traite that we are forced now to make u&s;e of the exchange for that purpo&s;e; where, to humour the people our mini&s;ter preaches twice a day and bapti&s;es all that come to him, &s;ome infants, &s;ome adults per&s;ons; we are now come to have praiers every Wedne&s;day and Friday mornings on their exchange, and re&s;olve not to be baffled by the great affronts; &s;ome calling our mini&s;ter Baals prie&s;t, and &s;ome of their meni&s;ters, from the pulpit, calling our praiers leeks, garlick and tra&s;h. We have often moved for an honourable maintenance for oure meni&s;ter; but they tell us tho&s;e that hire him mu&s;t mainetaine him, as they maintaine their owne meni&s;ters, by contribution. Of a pre&s;ident and eighteen members of the councell, there is onely my&s;elfe, &s;ince Mr Ma&s;ons departure for England, that is of the church of England, and twas never intended that that charge &s;hould be &s;upported by my&s;elfe and &s;ome few others of oure communion.</P>
<P>I humbly repre&s;ent to your grace, that the three meet|ing hou&s;es in Bo&s;ton might pay twentey &s;hillings a weeke, a piece, out of their contribution, towards the defraieing our church charges; that &s;ume being le&s;s per annum
<PB N="551" REF="011300_0278_0F86CD327676B020" MS="y">
than each of their mini&s;ters receive. We have yet ne|ce&s;&s;itie for another mini&s;ter to come over to us; for if any illne&s;s or indi&s;po&s;ition happen to the pre&s;ent incumbent, we have no man heere to performe the office. I am not to forgit to your grace the banke of monie in the hands of the corporation for evangelizing the Indians. Your grace was very de&s;ireous that that monie might be inquired af|ter, and applied to build us a church and free &s;chooll, that our youth might be no longer poy&s;oned with the &s;edi&s;&s;ious principles of this country: I am told that there is not le&s;s then two thou&s;and pounds here, but adventure not to &s;tir the lea&s;t in it, having all redie brought upon my &s;elf &s;o many enemi&s;e, and to all my crimes added this one as the greate&s;t in bringing the letherdge and cerimoni&s;e of the church of England to be ob&s;erved among&s;t us, and this day is a commencement at our collidge, which your grace was plea&s;ed to honoure with a pre&s;ent of the learn|ed Hamonds works, that rich man: They are all at pre&s;ent more taken up in puting in one Morton of Neventon-green, a rank independent, to be theire precident, than to &s;hew any re&s;pect which is due to youre graceou&s;e pre&s;ent, and I cannot expect it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e till his Maje&s;|tie &s;hall be plea&s;ed to &s;end us a generall governor from England.</P>
<P>Thus much relating to the&s;e affairs of oure church, that of our &s;tate little differs; mo&s;t part of our chiefe officers, as ju&s;tices of the peace, &amp;c. are congregationall men, and not above three church of England men; and not above three church of England officers in the militia; &s;o that in the maine I can only a&s;&s;ure your grace that the per&s;ons onely and not the government is changed.</P>
<P>Now from all this, after &s;o many hazards and difficulties which I have gon throw in the pro&s;ecution of his Maje|&s;ties &s;ervice in New England, I am, by their maliciou&s;e practi&s;es made very unea&s;ie; and &s;uch per&s;ons who reape particular advantages by the change of government hate me for accompli&s;hing it, and are makeing parties and factions to mi&s;repre&s;ent me to his Maje&s;tie.

<P>I Have &s;ome time &s;ince humbly repre&s;ented to your grace a nece&s;&s;ity of having a church built in Bo&s;ton to receive tho&s;e of the church of England. Wee have at pre|&s;ent 400 per&s;ons who are daily frequenters of our church, and as many more would come over to us, but &s;ome being trade&s;men, others of mechanick profe&s;&s;ions, are threatened by the congregationall men to be arre&s;ted by their creditors, or to be turned out of their work, if they offer to come to our church; under &s;uch di&s;couragements wee lye at pre&s;ent, and are forced to addre&s;s your grace for reliefe.</P>
<P>I have taken care to informe my&s;elf how the money &s;ent over hither for the company of evangelizing Indeans in New England (for &s;oe by their pattent from his late Maje&s;ty they are &s;tiled) is di&s;po&s;ed of here. Here are 7 per&s;ons, called commi&s;&s;ioners or tru&s;tees, who have the &s;ole manage of it; the chief of which are Mr. Dudley, our pre&s;ident, a man of a ba&s;e, &s;ervile and antimonarchicall principle, Mr. Stoughton, of the old leaven, Mr Richards, a man not to be tru&s;ted in publique bu&s;ine&s;s, Mr. Hinkley, governor of New Plimouth collony, a rigid independant, and others like to the&s;e. The poor Indians (tho&s;e who
<PB N="553" REF="011300_0279_0F86CD32B9B87958">
are called mini&s;ters) come and complaine to Mr. Ratclieffe, our mini&s;ter, that they have nothing allowed them: We have &s;poken to the commi&s;&s;ioners to have &s;ome allowance for them; all we can gett is the promi&s;e of a coar&s;e coat again&s;t winter, and would not &s;uffer Aaron, an Indian teacher, to have a bible with the common prayer in it, but took it away from him. This money is not le&s;s than 3 or 400<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> which is yearly returned over hither (&s;ome &s;ay 600) with which they enrich them&s;elves, yet charge it all as layd out among the poore Indians. I humbly pre&s;ume to remind your grace of your promi&s;e to me, when in Eng|land, that a commi&s;&s;ion &s;hould be directed to &s;ome per&s;ons here, unconcerned, to audit and report their acts of this money. We want good &s;choolema&s;ters, none being here allowed of but of ill principle, and, till there be provi&s;ion made to rectifye the youth of this country, there is noe hopes that this people will prove loyall. The money now converted to private, or wor&s;e u&s;es, will &s;et up good and publick &s;chooles and provide maintenance for our mini&s;ter, who now lives upon a &s;mall contribution, and are yet forced to meet in the town-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I cannot omit to acquaint your grace, how tender con|&s;cienced, members of our old church, for &s;oe they are di|&s;tingui&s;hed from the other 2 churches in Bo&s;ton, are. Not long &s;ince, I de&s;ired them to let their clerk toll their bell at 9 clock, Wedne&s;days and Fridays, for us to meet to go to prayers. Their men told me, in excu&s;e for not doing it, that they had con&s;idered and found it intrenched on their liberty of con&s;cience granted them by his Maje&s;tyes pre&s;ent commi&s;&s;ion, and could in noe wi&s;e a&s;&s;ent to it. The nece&s;&s;ity of a church and publick &s;chooles and encourage|ment of mini&s;ters pre&s;&s;es me to give your grace this trou|ble, which I humbly intreat your grace to remember to effect, lea&s;t the &s;mall beginnings of the church of England &s;ettled here with great difficulty, fall to the ground and be lo&s;t, for want of tymely relief and countenance.

<P>I Have with me your three letters of March the 7th, 11th and 7th April, by Mr. Ma&s;on, for all which I heartily thank you, and for your particular direction in the &s;everal &s;tages of my employ. I have very lately had the bonds of ma&s;ters of &s;hips bound from hence to England in my cu&s;tody, and tho&s;e are indor&s;ed that copys thereof are &s;ent for England; you &s;hall not faile of the duplicates if this &s;hip makes not too much &s;peed, and for the future you may expect them with my other accounts of the cu&s;|tom-hou&s;e; however I am to take it as a favour if I be per|mitted to &s;end them directly to the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, in regard I have been cen&s;ured for &s;uffering my papers but to look fir&s;t into the plantation office, and the primier, there now, objected hard again&s;t me. Pardon my digre&s;&s;ion, you are &s;en&s;ible how much bu&s;ine&s;s I have lying upon me, to &s;end accounts and duplicates from my cu&s;tom-office. I am at 50<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> a year charge to keep an able clerke. I cannot yet get any fees &s;ettled &s;ufficient to pay that charge, Mr. Stough|ton, Mr. Wharton and others objecting that his Maje&s;ties &s;alary for 100<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> a year is to defrey all that charge, &s;o that I am a great lo&s;er, be&s;ides I am to have deputies in our &s;everal ports, and unle&s;s they allow fees I am not capable of doing that &s;ervice at a di&s;tance without deputies, and their not allowing moderate fees is only to di&s;courage from in&s;pecting their irregular trade. This his excellency has endeavoured to have rectified, but is oppo&s;ed by my enemies, to my very great lo&s;&s;e, and prejudice to my deputyes.

<P>By the &s;everall Gazetts, filled with addre&s;&s;es, I find you are all at liberty at home, and I believe the court is &s;o taken up with the weightier matters of &s;tate that there will be no room for my wife to addre&s;&s;e my petition for a confirmation of my office of &s;ecretary and &s;ole regi&s;ter, &amp;c. which I pray may be enlarged and extended to the limitts of the pre&s;ent government. I &s;ee no rea&s;on why I &s;hould re&s;ede in my de&s;ires of getting an under&s;tanding gentleman to come from home to engage in the di&s;charge of the &s;ecretary's and regi&s;ter's office, which is very bene|ficiall to We&s;t, no fees being as yet agreed upon, and I have ground to believe de&s;ignedly done to di&s;courage any to undertake that office, whil&s;t, in the mean time, he extorts what fees he plea&s;es, to the great oppre&s;&s;ion of the people, and renders the pre&s;ent government grievous. I have wrote you of the want we have of two or three hone&s;t atturneys (if any &s;uch thing in nature) we have but two, one is Mr. We&s;t's creature, came with him from New-York, and drives all before him; he al&s;o takes extravagant fees, and for want of more the country cannot avoid com|ing to him, &s;o that we had better be quite without them than not to have more. I have wrote Mr. Blathwait the great nece&s;&s;ity of judges from England. I know there are &s;ome loyall gentlemen and able lawyers, who have not practice; the judges with us, being now 3, have 390<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> be|twixt them all, be&s;ides their fees, which they make very con&s;iderable to them: Now, two will &s;erve our occa&s;ions.

<P>I Am to thank you for yours of the 23d of November, and would not faile to an&s;wer the chief particulars. If the union of all New England under one governor be acceptable on your &s;ide the water, what will the joining and annexing to the &s;ame government be of all the En|gli&s;h territories in America, from Delaware bay to Nova Scotia? This is already determined by his Maje&s;ty, and a commi&s;&s;ion con&s;tituting Sir Edmund Andros governor al&s;o of New-York, as united to and parcel of his Maje&s;ties dominion of New-England. And for the two Jer&s;ies, &s;cire facias's are expediting towards their union. This, be&s;ides other advantages, will be terrible to the French and make them proceed with more caution than they have lately done.</P>
<P>I am obliged to you for your kind pre&s;ent of cranberries, acorns, che&s;nuts, &amp;c. which came very well and are im|parted to Mr. Robert Southwell. The little box of locu&s;t trees was broke open and they are lo&s;t, which was a pity, &s;ince they are &s;o &s;hady as you mention. I told the king of the black fox, who taking not much notice of it, I keep it my&s;elf, unle&s;s you think otherwi&s;e to di&s;po&s;e of it.</P>
<P>Care is already taken for the pa&s;&s;ing your patent for all New-England, and if Mr. Spragg were not in the way, it might have been for the whole new dominion.</P>
<P>Pray, pre&s;ent my humble &s;ervice to Mr. Ma&s;on and let him know Mr. Povey gives him particular in&s;tructions by this &s;hip how to proceed regularly. The governour needs not any order from hence to do ju&s;tice. If Mr. Ma&s;on be aggrieved he may appeal.</P>
<P>My humble &s;ervice likewi&s;e to Capt. Nichol&s;on, who I hope may be the lieut. governour intended by the King
<PB N="560" REF="011300_0283_0F86CD3E02F33BD8">
for the New-England. Nor let my &s;ervice be forgot to my cou&s;in Treffry, who&s;e relations are all very well.</P>
<P>Since you are &s;o mindfull of my concerns, the inclo&s;ed paper will &s;hew you how the article for the auditors is to be worded. But pray remember the fir&s;t accompt of the pre&s;ident and councill. It was &s;ent back with &s;everall queries, in order to the &s;atisfying the lords commi&s;&s;ioners of the trea&s;ury, and I expect your return of it. And you may do well to help Sir E. Andros to di&s;patch the fir&s;t ac|compt &s;ince his arrivall, by &s;etting forth every particular, how expended, more minutely than the parchment &s;ent me does contain, that the Lords of the trea&s;ury may not except again&s;t the method of it.</P>
<P>I &s;end you the gazettes touching the pirates and Sir R. Holmes. The King has granted him all pirates goods for 3 years and the power of pardoning for one year. He offers fair to di&s;coverers and &s;uch as &s;urrender them&s;elves, and will certainly make good his promi&s;e. An accident on that account may make your fortune, as you are mo&s;t in the way of that &s;ort of people.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not forget my humble &s;ervice to all my other friends and acquaintance with you. Time and patience will &s;tand you in great &s;tead, amid&s;t your di&s;appointments and afflictions, and you will always find that I am mo&s;t truly</P>

<P>I Received your two letters of the 8th and 18th March, the fir&s;t at Pemmequid, where, after a tedious pa&s;&s;age in 5 or 6 boats and other water carriage, I overtooke his excellency, being left behind at Bo&s;ton, by &s;ickne&s;s, about the end of Aprill la&s;t. The Governor, with his &s;ervants, travelled by land to Pi&s;cataqua; Col. Ma&s;on was vi&s;iting the militia in the province of Maine, and was forced to follow the Governor to Ca&s;co bay, where the Governor's &s;loop and barge with 10 oares attended their coming; he
<PB N="562" REF="011300_0284_0F86CD3ECBC444A0">
went among&s;t all the i&s;lands in Ca&s;co bay, vi&s;ited Mr. Whar|ton's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions at Pejep&s;gut, and rowed up many leagues in Kennebeck river; from thence, by ea&s;y motions, they got to Pemmequid, where he &s;tayed 3 or 4 dayes to refre&s;h them&s;elves with &s;heep and foules, and then, with the Ro&s;e frigott, made towards Ponob&s;cott; his Excellency had &s;ooner, by me before, appointed Capt. George to &s;peake to Mon&s;ieur St. Ca&s;teen, and to acquaint him with his come|ing; the captain roade with his frigott before Ca&s;teen's doore, &s;ent his lieut. a&s;hoare, Ca&s;teen &s;poake to him and told him, but upon notice of the Governor's comeing, Ca&s;teen and all the company retired, left the place to that  <GAP DESC="blank">  and left his hou&s;e &s;hutt; the Governor landed, with other gentlemen with him, and went into the hou&s;e and found a &s;mall altar in the common roome, which altar, and &s;ome pictures and ordinary ornaments, they did not meddle with any thing belonging thereto, but tooke away all his armes, powder, &s;hott, iron kettles and &s;ome trucking cloath and his chaires, all which were putt aboard the Ro&s;e and laid up in order to a condemnation of tradeing, in the forte at Pemmequid; at their returne, notice being irregularly given to the Indian Sachem, neighbour to Ca&s;teen, that he &s;hould have all his goods re&s;tored if he would demand them at Pemmequid and come under obedience to the King, it is &s;uppo&s;ed he went and acquainted the Governor at Port Royall of it, and how re&s;ented we were to expect by the returne of our fi&s;hing ve&s;&s;els. This Ca&s;teen is a Frenchman, has lived there many yeares, has 3 or 4 Indian wives and goes a hunting with the Indians, he has a tradeing hou&s;e and &s;old the Indians, armes and ammunition in the late Indian wars; he does not well like to be under the French government, de&s;ires to live indifferent. His Excellency carryed with him carpenters and boards, nailes and all nece&s;&s;ary &s;tores, intending to erect a forte at Ponop&s;cutt, the old one, as they &s;ay, being gone to ruin, formerly made up with &s;tone and turfe, but finding none there, was re&s;olved to &s;pare that charge till a more proper time offered, and in his Ex|cellency's
<PB N="563" REF="011300_0284_0F86CD3ECBC444A0">
returne from Ponop&s;cutt, 5 or 6 leagues off from thence, I meete the Governor at &s;ea, I being bound to Po|nop&s;cutt, but I then returned with him to Pemmaquid. The Governor &s;ent out, every way, me&s;&s;engers to &s;ummon in all the Indian Sachems; &s;uch as were at Pemmaquid at his fir&s;t arrivall, &s;tayd his returne; they were well treated with &s;hirts, rumm and trucking cloath, but his Excellency, with a &s;hort &s;peech, by an interpreter, acquaint|ed them that they &s;hould not fear the French, that he would defend them, and ordered them to call home all their young men and they &s;hould live quietly and undi|&s;turbed. There I went to one Shurt, town clarke of Pemmequid, to know what lea&s;es were made lately and by whom, and for what quitt rent; he told me that above 2 years agoe Capt. Palmer and Mr. We&s;t produced to them a commi&s;&s;ion from Col. Dongan, to di&s;po&s;e of all their land to whoever would take lea&s;es at 5<ABBR><HI>&s;.</HI></ABBR> the hundred acres quitt rent; they lett there and at a place called Dart|mouth, 12 or 16 miles di&s;tant from Pemmequid, about 140 lea&s;es, &s;ome had 800 or 1000 acres, few le&s;s than 100, &s;ome but 3 or 4 acres, and all paid 2<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> 10<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 0<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> for pa&s;&s;ing their grantes of 100 acres of woodland with 20 acres of mar&s;h, wherever it could be found; but this bred a great mi&s;chiefe among&s;t the people, few or none have their land mea&s;ured or marked, they were in ha&s;te and gott what they could; they had their emi&s;&s;aries among&s;t the poore people and frighted them to take grantes, &s;ome came and complained to the Governor and prayed him to confirme their rights, which he refu&s;ed to doe, the commi&s;&s;ion and whole proceeding being illegall, having notice they were to be under his government, they re&s;ented it, but it &s;erved their turne. The poor have been very much oppre&s;&s;ed here, the forte run all to ruin and wants a greate deale to repaire it; the Governor has ordered it to be well re|paired; it &s;tands very well to command a very good bay and harbour about it, and will in time be a good place, being the only good porte for all ve&s;&s;els, ea&s;tward, to ride well and &s;ecure by the forte from danger. At this time,

Capt. Palmer and Mr. We&s;t laid out for them&s;elves &s;uch large lotts, and Mr. Graham, tho' not there, had a child's portion, I think &s;ome have 8 or 10000 acres; I hear not of one penny rent comeing in to the King from them who have their grants confirmed at Yorke, and this 5<ABBR><HI>&s;.</HI></ABBR> an hundred acres was only a &s;ham upon the people. At our returne, we &s;aw very good land at Winter harbour, enough to make large &s;ettlements for many people: The Governor will have it fir&s;t mea&s;ured and then &s;urveyed, and then will di&s;po&s;e of it for &s;ettlements.</P>
<P>Mr. Graham and his family are &s;ettled in Bo&s;ton, he is made attourny generall and now the Governor is &s;afe in his New Yorke confidents, all others being &s;trangers to his councill. My cou&s;en Ma&s;on can make no progre&s;s in his bu&s;ine&s;s, he has attempted to try his title at Pi&s;cataqua, but has been delayed by the judges, and the inhabitants are far more ob&s;tinate than formerly, Mr. We&s;t haveing told &s;ome of them that his title is little worth. All Mr. We&s;t aimes at is to have the pa&s;&s;ing grantes for all Mr. Ma&s;on's lands, and neither he nor Graham will allow that he has power to make a grante to any tennant; they are for leiveing him out of all. The newes of the di&s;&s;enters being indulged and taken into favour, at home, encouraged this people, and the judges will not give a cau&s;e for the King. They now di&s;pute his Excellency's grantes and plead either po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or Indian purcha&s;e in barr of it. The addition of New Yorke to this government does very much inlarge our bounds and may be of greate &s;ervice to the crowne, but they have been &s;queezed dry by Colonell Dongan and his agents We&s;t and Graham, that there is little good to be done. We are in greate expectation of Foyes arrivall, and &s;ome preparations are makeing for a &s;outharne expedition, but I believe Sir Edmund will not goe into New Yorke till Col. Dongan is removed off the place, there is no good under&s;tanding betwixt them, and twas not well done of Palmer and We&s;t to tear all in pieces that was &s;ettled and granted at Pemmequid by Sir Edmund, that was the &s;ceene where they placed and di&s;placed at

<P>THESE are only to returne you thanks for your kind letter dated July 3. 88. It was exceeding welcome to heare from you, and the good a&s;pect that his Maje&s;tie hath towards his poor New-England &s;ubjects. I hope mine to your &s;elfe, by Capt. Belcher, might come &s;ea&s;on|ably; only let me advi&s;e not to pre&s;ent any thing by way of complaint to his Maje&s;tie, for that I feare will do us more hurt than good; it may be of u&s;e to pre&s;ent to friends to &s;hew the rea&s;on why we &s;upplicate his Maje&s;tie for the confirmation of us in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and that he will grant us the &s;ame privileges that others of his plan|tations are not denyed, namely a generall a&s;&s;embly, with|out which our condition is little inferiour to ab&s;olute &s;la|very. And for my own part, if that cant be obtained, I do not think the change of our governour will ea&s;e any thing, for the greater intere&s;t at court will add greatly to our burthens, and emboulden him that hath the power in his hand to &s;quea&s;e to extremity. I entreat you wholly to conceale my name from tho&s;e of our own people or others that you confer with, for it may do me much harm and no good to the publick. I &s;hall think long till I hear the i&s;&s;ue of matters.</P>
<P>Concerning tho&s;e matters that I wrote to you about, re|ferring to my&s;elfe, I have received a letter from my &s;i&s;ter that gives mee account the time hath now pa&s;&s;ed &s;o long

<P>Mr. Peter Bulkley dyed about three months &s;ince, and verely his &s;un did &s;et in a cloud.</P>
<P>It hath plea&s;ed God again to &s;uffer the natives to do us mi&s;chiefe in July la&s;t, three or more per&s;ons killed at Quackeage on Connecticot river, one man at New Haven, and &s;undry at the Ea&s;tward, &s;ome at Kenebeck and Cape Porpos, in all, about twenty &s;ix per&s;ons killed, &s;o that all the out towns are driven into garri&s;ons, and under great affrightment. Sir Edmund hath lately been at New York, and from thence to Albany, &amp;c. thorow the country, was ab&s;ent about 11 weeks, and, as I hear, will not allow it to be called a war, but murtherous acts, and he will inquire the grounds; is not plea&s;ed that any &s;oldiers were levyed, in his ab&s;ence, to &s;end ea&s;tward, and hath re|lea&s;ed from pri&s;on Indians that were &s;ent thence, i. e. from ea&s;tward.

<SALUTE>Rev. Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR loveing lines were with much joy received and read by me, for which I humbly ble&s;s God, and return your&s;elfe many thanks. By rea&s;on of the great expectation of your &s;udden arrivall (with other of your friends) I did willingly omitt writeing unto you by the la&s;t opportunity, but now, con&s;idering the times are among tho&s;e things re&s;erved by God to his own di&s;po&s;e, I &s;hall adventure the ri&s;ke of a few lines, committing your&s;elfe and my endeavours herein to the good providence of God.</P>
<P>Its now 14 weeks &s;ince the revolution of the government here, the manner whereof, before the&s;e can reach you, will &s;pread farr and neare; future con&s;equences wee are igno|rant of, yet wee know that, at pre&s;ent, wee are ea&s;ed of tho&s;e great oppre&s;&s;ions that wee groaned under, by the ex|erci&s;e of an arbitrary and illegall commi&s;&s;ion, &s;ome briefe account whereof is contained in the declaration publi&s;hed the &s;ame day, a coppie whereof I herewith &s;end you. The bu&s;ines was acted by the &s;oldiers that came armed into Bo&s;ton from all parts, to the great amazement of all beholders, being greatly animated by the Prince's declara|tions, which about that time came into the country, and
<PB N="568" REF="011300_0287_0F86CD42A5D75508">
heightened by the oppre&s;&s;ions of the governor, judges, and the mo&s;t wicked extortion of their debauched officers. The ancient magi&s;trates and elders, although they had &s;trenuou&s;ly advi&s;ed to further waiting for orders from England, and di&s;couraged any attempts of that nature &s;o farr as they had opportunity, yet were they now com|pelled to a&s;&s;i&s;t with their pre&s;ence and councells for the prevention of blood&s;hed, which had mo&s;t certainly been the i&s;&s;ue if prudent coun&s;ells had not been given to both parties. A coppie of that paper &s;ent Sir Edm. Andro&s;s I have herewith &s;ent you, upon which he forthwith came and &s;urrendered him&s;elfe. The &s;ame day, about 30 more of the principall per&s;ons of that knot were &s;ecured, where|of &s;ome were quickly relea&s;ed, and &s;ome yet remaine un|der re&s;traint, Eight of whom, viz. Mr. Dudley, Sir Ed|mund, Mr. Randolph, Mr. We&s;t, Mr. Palmer, Mr. Grai|ham, Mr. Sherlock, Mr. Farwell, the repre&s;entatives of the people, at their la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ions, voted unbailable. Mr. Dudley in a peculiar manner is the object of the peoples di&s;plea&s;ure, even thorow out all the colonies where he hath &s;at judge, they deeply re&s;ent his corre&s;pondency with that wicked man Mr. Randolph for the overturning the government, and the manner of his procuring his pre&s;ident|&s;hip, his extream covetou&s;nes, getting to him&s;elf &s;o many bags of money, to the ruinating of trade, and &s;ince Sir Edmund's arrivall here, hath been his great in&s;trument in the oppre&s;&s;ion of the people, choo&s;ing rather to do that ba&s;e drudgerie then to di&s;plea&s;e, and thereby endanger the lo&s;&s;e of his honor and gaine. The&s;e and &s;uch like things have made him vile in the eyes of all generally both good and bad, &s;o that the governor and councill, though they have done their uttermo&s;t to procure his inlargement, yet cant prevaile, but the people will have him in the jaile, and when he hath been by their order turned out, by force and tumult they fetch him in againe, and both he and the re&s;t of them there remaine till relea&s;ed by orders from England. I am deeply &s;en&s;ible that we have a wolfe by the ears. This one thing being circum&s;tanced
<PB N="569" REF="011300_0287_0F86CD42A5D75508">
with much difficulty, the people will not permitt any in|largement, they having accu&s;ed them of trea&s;on again&s;t their king and country; and tho&s;e re&s;trained, they, threa|ten at a high rate for being denyed an habeas corpus. I do therefore earne&s;tly entreat of you to procure the be&s;t advice you can in this matter that, if po&s;&s;ible, the good in|tents of the people and their loyalty to the crown of Eng|land may not turn to their prejudice. The example of England, the declarations put forth by the Prince of Orange, now our King, the alteration of the government in England making the arbitrary commi&s;&s;ion of Sir Edmund null and void in the law; the&s;e con&s;iderations, in conjunction with the great oppre&s;&s;ions they lay under, were &s;o far prevalent in the minds of all, that although &s;ome could not advi&s;e to the enterpri&s;e, yet are hopefull that we &s;hall not be greatly blamed, but &s;hall have a pardon granted for any error the law will charge us with in this matter. The exerci&s;e of Sir Edmund's commi&s;&s;ion, &s;o contrarie to the magna charta, is &s;urely enough to call him to account by his &s;uperiours, and al&s;o Mr. Dudley that led the van in that tragedy; and for others of them, may we be quit of them, as we hope for no good from them, &s;o we are farr from de&s;iring to revenge our &s;elves upon them, let what they have met with be a warn|ing to others how they e&s;&s;ay to oppre&s;s their Maje&s;ties good &s;ubjects any more in that kind. I crave an an&s;wer hereunto by the fir&s;t opportunity.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t al&s;o yet a little further acquaint you that &s;undry of tho&s;e gentlemen and merchants that were very active in this matter on the day of the revolution yet, &s;ince, mi&s;|&s;ing of what they expected the people univer&s;ally crying up their charter priviledges and urging the old governor and magi&s;trates to rea&s;&s;ume the former government all which they were de&s;igned to oppo&s;e but had hopes to advance their private intere&s;ts of which finding them&s;elves now di&s;appointed, are greatly di&s;contented and &s;peake high|ly again&s;t the repre&s;entatives of the people and pre&s;ent government and, as we are informed, &s;undry of them, mo&s;tly

factors and &s;trangers, have drawn a petition to the lords of the committee for forreign plantations, pretending loyalty and advance of revenue to the crown, and highly inveighing again&s;t the government and people, whereas, in truth, they are the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of tho&s;e acts for trade and navigation, and tho&s;e whom they complain again&s;t are ge|nerally unconcerned in either, and &s;o uncapable to do the thing they accu&s;e them of. If any thing of this nature be pre&s;ented, let me intreat you &s;edulou&s;ly to divert the mi&s;|chief intended and &s;end me a coppie thereof by the fir&s;t opportunity.</P>
<P>Capt. George, commander of the Ro&s;e frigott, was al&s;o the &s;ame day with the re&s;t of that knott &s;eized, reports being &s;pread by &s;undry of his men, that he intended for France, there to waite on the late King James, and before his departure to &s;hew his &s;pleen again&s;t Bo&s;ton, &s;o that the people were afraid of being murdered and burnt up in their beds, the lieutenant al&s;o a known papi&s;t. The &s;ails of the frigott are brought on &s;hore and &s;ecured till the go|vernment here receive their Maje&s;ty's order, for which deed its hoped we &s;hall not receive blame. We do crave that the circum&s;tances of our ca&s;e and condition in all re&s;|pects may be con&s;idered. Nature hath taught us &s;elfe pre&s;ervation: God commands it, as being the rule of cha|rity towards our neighbour: Our great remotenes from England denys us the opportunity of direction and order from thence for the regulating our&s;elves in all imergencies, nor have we meanes to know the laws and cu&s;tomes of our nation: The&s;e things are our great di&s;advantage: We have alwayes endeavoured to approve our&s;elves loyall to the crown of England, and are well a&s;&s;ured that none of our wor&s;t enemyes dare to tax us in that matter, and we have al&s;o laboured to attend the directions of our charter, under the &s;ecurity whereof were laid by our fathers the foun|dation of this his Maje&s;ties colony, and we are not with|out hopes but that before you do receive the&s;e lines we &s;hall receive from their royall Maje&s;ties the confirmation of our charter, with &s;uch addition of privileges as may ad|vance

<OPENER><DATELINE>Goal in Bo&s;ton,

<SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY a heady multitude po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with jealou&s;yes that our Governor, Sir Edmund Andros, was a papi&s;t and intended to bring on the French and Indians to cut off the inhabitants, a generall in&s;urrection was intended and &s;o perfected on the 18th of Aprill la&s;t, that the Governor, hoping to &s;ecure him&s;elfe in our fort, mi&s;&s;ed an opportu|nity of going aboard the Ro&s;e frigott, then at anchor in the harbour, and &s;o, being overpowered, wee were taken pri&s;oners of warr, as the &s;illy multitude told us. This proceeded from a dayly expectation (that one Mather, one of their mini&s;ters in Bo&s;ton, had rai&s;ed by his letters to them from court in the height of popery) of a new charter. I know he or any other (having fir&s;t &s;ub&s;cribed to re|pealing their penall lawes and te&s;t) might for their money obtain fair promi&s;es of, and he had &s;o far prevailed with Sir Thomas Powis, atturney generall, that he had obtained a report in their favour, upon many fal&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions, which, immediately on the P. of Orange his intending to vi&s;it the court of England vani&s;hed; however, he had no other engine to draw &s;upplyes of money from the di&s;&s;ati&s;|fied party here, but to feed them up with a&s;&s;urances of a
<PB N="572" REF="011300_0289_0F86CD483B413C38">
new and much larger charter. They were impatient at his delay and, hearing the newes that all papi&s;ts were either &s;ecured or fled out of England, and would not be|lieve but Sir Edmund was a papi&s;t and his commi&s;&s;ion ar|bitrary and calculated onely for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing all per&s;ons of a different per&s;wa&s;ion; they caballed and accordingly executed their principall re&s;olutions: They have not yet &s;ent to England, expecting Mather, their Mahomett, or at lea&s;t particular orders from court, which will not operate here unle&s;&s;e con&s;onant to their humours. We have, at this day, above 100 per&s;ons equally concerned as con&s;ervators of the peace, but their power &s;ignifies nothing, further than it plea&s;es the people; &s;ometymes they are for having their old magi&s;trates rea&s;&s;ume their former government; &s;ometymes to form a new modell of government; but their being many more ready (and of nece&s;&s;ity di&s;po&s;ed) to pull down than build up, they know not what to be att: Some, that have e&s;tates and &s;hipping abroad, feare they have done more than they can an&s;wer, believing other go|vernments will treat them as revolters from their alle|giance, and give them neither protection nor lett them de|part till they have orders from home how to treat them. This you may plea&s;e to communicate to the other govern|ments leeward of you, to whom I have not an opportu|nity to write, who, I am well a&s;&s;ured, will al&s;o highly re&s;ent it, and &s;o will the pre&s;ent con&s;titution at home, whoever be in the throne, and not &s;uffer &s;o high an in|dignity to be putt upon the mo&s;t authentick authority any Prince can give his &s;ubjects for their &s;ecurity and pro|tection, whil&s;t they act by a power confirmed by the broad &s;eal. God onely knowes how affaires &s;tand at home. I am confident they will never part with me, unle&s;&s;e de|manded, by a force or their &s;hips &s;toped in the plantations till I am delivered up for their liberty and licence to trade. This country is poor, the exact execution of the acts of trade hath much impoveri&s;hed them; all the blame lyes upon me, who fir&s;t attacked and then overthrew their charter, and was made the officer to continue their Egyp|tian

&s;ervitude, by my office of collector, &amp;c. I intreat you to repre&s;ent my &s;tate to the Earls of Clarendon and Ro|che&s;ter, by the fir&s;t opportunity, and that the Governor and I may be &s;ent for home by &s;ome frigotts. I mu&s;t confe&s;&s;e there have been ill men from New-York, who have too much &s;tuddied the di&s;ea&s;e of this people, and both in courts and councills they have not been treated well. However, nothing done can amount to countenance &s;uch an open rebellion, and, were I in England, I mu&s;t advi&s;e a generall pardon, many hundred of innocent per|&s;ons being forced to act, otherwi&s;e to be impri&s;oned; and the kingdome of England cannot loo&s;e this country nor govern it without &s;ome re&s;pect and allowance to the weak|nes of tho&s;e who are mi&s;lead and the force of education and the byas of common prejudices: However, we are, at pre&s;ent, as much di&s;tracted and as far from cementing into any &s;ort of government as at the building of Babell. God onely keeps them from de&s;troying us.</P>
<P>You will have one Robert Glanvill from Salem, ma&s;ter of a ketch, he was impri&s;oned here, for an abettor of py|rates, and was impri&s;oned with 7 pyrates, he can tell you their names; he brought into this country 3700 and odd Spani&s;h hides, robb'd from a Portuge&s;&s;e ve&s;&s;ell, the men thrown overboard, with other goods to the value of about 2000<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> This is all proved by &s;ufficient witne&s;&s;es and they kept in goal till &s;ome particular order from Sir Robert Holmes. About Oct. la&s;t, he &s;ent his commi&s;&s;ion to the Governor and my&s;elfe, dated the 26 Aug. 88. which we receiving not till November, and the Governor and I &s;tay|ing to the ea&s;tward till the limite was pa&s;t, could not a|gree upon a method of proceeding again&s;t them, in regard they &s;tood upon their ju&s;tification, but rather, wee could not be a&s;&s;ured of a jury that would find again&s;t them, up|on the mo&s;t evident proofe, but now they are at liberty, have their goods, and perhaps may bring &s;ome of the hides, or barrels of &s;mall barrs of copper to your i&s;land: However, I think the ketch is forfeited for bringing in the pyrates and their goods to this country, knowing the

men to be &s;uch, for Glanvill, in his ketch, &s;ayled in com|pany with the pyrates, in the ve&s;&s;ell they tooke, as far as New England; he went to Salem, appointed to meet them at Port a Bear, in Nova Scotia, and did &s;o and carried them &s;upplyes and provi&s;ions; when they burned the ve&s;&s;ell and brought away the goods in this ketch and other ve&s;&s;els. This I heartily refer to your conduct and privacy, my life lying at &s;take for the lea&s;t di&s;covery.

That you have not ere this had an account of our affaires particularly directed unto your &s;elfe, proceeded neither from forgetfullne&s;s nor neglect, but &s;olely from our daily expectations of &s;eeing you here, wee being &s;o long time without any intelligence from England.
