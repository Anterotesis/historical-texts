<HEAD>THE <HI>Scripture Doctrine</HI> of <HI>Prede&s;tination, Election</HI> and <HI>Reprobation.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE Scripture &s;aith, <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Eph&s;.</HI> i. 4.</NOTE> <HI>God hath cho&s;en us in Chri&s;t, before the Foundation of the World, that we &s;hould be holy, and without Blame before him in Love.</HI> And St. <HI>Peter</HI> calls the Saints, <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Pet.</HI> i. 2.</NOTE> <HI>Elect according to the Fore-knowledge of God the Father, thro' Sanctification of the Spirit, unto Obedi|ence.</HI> And St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aith unto them, <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>The&s;.</HI> ii. 13, 14.</NOTE> <HI>God hath from the Beginning cho&s;en you to Salvation, thro' Sanctification of the Spi|rit, and belief of the Truth; whereunto he hath called you by our Go&s;pel, to the obtaining of the Glory of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. From all the&s;e Places of Scripture, it is plain that God hath cho&s;en &s;ome to Life and Glory, before or from the Foun+dation of the World. And the Wi&s;dom of all Chri&s;tians is, to labour that their Judgments may be informed herein, ac|cording to the Scripture. And to that End let us con&s;ider the Manner of God's &s;peaking to the Sons of Men.</P>
<P N="3">3. God &s;aith to <HI>Abraham,</HI> Rom. iv. 17. <HI>As it is written, I have made thee a Father of Many Nations before him whom he believed, even God who quickeneth the Dead, and calleth Things that are not as tho' they were.</HI> Ob&s;erve, God &s;peaks then, at that pre&s;ent Time, to <HI>Abraham,</HI> &s;aying, <HI>I have made thee a Father of many Nations</HI> notwith&s;tanding <HI>Abraham</HI> was not at that Time the Father of one Child, but <HI>I&s;hmael.</HI> How then mu&s;t we under&s;tand <HI>I have made thee a Father of many Nations?</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The Apo&s;tle tells us plainly, it was &s;o, <HI>Before God, who calleth Things that are not, as tho' they were.</HI> And &s;o he calleth <HI>Abraham, The Father of many Nations,</HI> tho' he
<PB REF="005881_0003_102758EBB6643990">
was not as yet; tho' he was not as yet the Father even of <HI>I&s;aac, in whom his Seed was to be called.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. God u&s;eth the &s;ame Manner of Speaking, when he calleth Chri&s;t, <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Revel.</HI> xiii 8.</NOTE> <HI>The Lamb &s;lain from the Foundation of the World;</HI> altho' in Deed he was not &s;lain for &s;everal thou&s;and Years after. Hence therefore we may ea&s;ily un|der&s;tand what he &s;peaketh of <HI>Electing us from the Founda|tion of the World.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. God calleth <HI>Abraham a Father of many Nations,</HI> tho' not &s;o at that Time. He calleth Chri&s;t, <HI>The Lamb &s;lain from the Foundation of the World,</HI> tho' not &s;lain till he was a Man in the Fle&s;h. Even &s;o he calleth Men <HI>Elected from the Foundation of the World,</HI> tho' not elected till they were Men in the Fle&s;h. Yet it is all &s;o before God, who knowing all Things from Eternity. <HI>Calleth Things that are not, as tho' they were.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. By all which it is clear, that as Chri&s;t was called <HI>The Lamb &s;lain from the Foundation of the World,</HI> and yet not &s;lain till &s;everal thou&s;and Years after, till the Day of his Death; &s;o al&s;o Men are called <HI>Elect from the Foundation of the World,</HI> and yet are not elected perhaps till &s;everal thou&s;and Years after, till the Day of their Conver&s;ion to God.</P>
<P N="8">8. And indeed this is plain, without going farther, from tho&s;e very Words of St. <HI>Peter, Elect, according to the Fore-knowledge of God, thro' Sanctification of the Spirit, unto Obedience.</HI> For,</P>
<P>If the Elect are cho&s;en thro' the Sanctification of the Spirit, then they were not cho&s;en before they were &s;anc|tify'd by the Spirit. But they were not &s;anctify'd by the Spirit, before they had a Being. It is plain then neither were they cho&s;en from the Foundation of the World. But <HI>God calleth Things that are not, as tho' they were.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. This is al&s;o plain from tho&s;e Words of St. <HI>Paul, God hath from the Beginning cho&s;en you to Salvation, thro' Sanctification of the Spirit, and Belief of the Truth.</HI> Now,</P>
<P><PB REF="005881_0004_102758ED43F29308">If the Saints are cho&s;en to Salvation, thro' believing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> the Truth, and were called to believe that Truth by the hearing of the Go&s;pel, then they were not cho&s;en before they believed the Truth, and before they heard the Go&s;pel, whereby they were called to believe. But they were cho&s;en thro' Belief of the Truth, and called to believe it by the Go&s;pel. Therefore they were not cho&s;en before they believed; much le&s;s before they had a Being, any more than Chri&s;t was &s;lain, before <HI>he</HI> had a Being. So plain is it, that they were not elected, till they believed; altho' <HI>God calleth Things that are not, as tho' they were.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. Again, how plain is it, where St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aith that they whom <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ephe&s;.</HI> i. 11, 12.</NOTE> <HI>God did prede&s;tinate, according to the Coun&s;el of his own Will, to be to the Prai&s;e of his Glory,</HI> were &s;uch as did <HI>fir&s;t tru&s;t in Chri&s;t?</HI> And in the very next Ver&s;e, he &s;aith, that they <HI>tru&s;ted in Chri&s;t, after they heard the Word of Truth</HI> (not before.) But they did not hear the Word before they were born. Therefore, it is plain, the Act of Election is <HI>in Time,</HI> tho' known of God before; who, according to his Knowledge, often &s;peaketh of the Things <HI>which are not, as tho' they were.</HI> And thus is the great Stumbling-Block about Election taken away, that Men may <HI>make their Calling and Election &s;ure.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. The Scripture tells us as plainly what Prede&s;tina|tion is: It is, God's fore appointing obedient Believers to Salvation, not without, but <HI>according to his Fore-knowledge</HI> of all their Work, <HI>from the Foundation of the World.</HI> And &s;o likewi&s;e he prede&s;tinate or fore appoints all di&s;|obedient Unbelievers to Damnation, not without, but <HI>ac|cording to his Fore-knowledge</HI> of all their Works, <HI>from the Foundation of the World.</HI></P>
<P N="12">12. We may con&s;ider this a little farther. God from the Foundation of the World fore knew all Men's believing or not believing. And according to this his Fore-know|ledge, he cho&s;e or <HI>elected</HI> all obedient Believers, as &s;uch, to Salvation, and refu&s;ed or <HI>reprobated</HI> all di&s;obedient Unbe|lievers,
<PB REF="005881_0005_102758F1418FF2B8">
as &s;uch, to Damnation. Thus the Scriptures teach us to con&s;ider <HI>Election</HI> and <HI>Reprobation, according to the Fore-knowledge of God from the Foundation of the World.</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. But here &s;ome may object, that I hold our Faith and Obedience to be the Cau&s;e of God's electing us to Glory.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, I do hold, That Faith in Chri&s;t producing Obedience to him is <HI>a Cau&s;e without which</HI> God electeth none to Glory; for we never read of God's electing to Glory, any who liv'd and died a di&s;obedient Unbeliever. But I do not hold, that it is <HI>the Cau&s;e for which</HI> he elects any: The contrary of this is ea&s;ily &s;hewn, thus:</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e my Obedience is a Cau&s;e of my Election to Salvation, What is the Cau&s;e of my Obedience?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> My Love to Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>But what is the Cau&s;e of my Love to Chri&s;t?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> My Faith in Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>But what is the Cau&s;e of my Faith in Chri&s;t?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> The Preaching of the Go&s;pel of Christ.</P>
<P>But what is the Cau&s;e of the Preaching of the Go&s;pel to us? <HI>An&s;</HI> Chri&s;t's dying for us.</P>
<P>But what is the Cau&s;e of Chri&s;t's dying for us?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> God's great Love of Pity wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins.</P>
<P N="14">14. Thus all Men may &s;ee, that I do not hold God cho&s;e any Man to Life and Salvation for any Good which he had done, or for any which was in him, before he put it there. And this I &s;hall now &s;hew more at large from the Oracles of God.</P>
<P N="1">1. God's great Love of Pity, wherewith he loved the Sons of Men, even while they were dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins, was the Cau&s;e of his &s;ending his Son to die for them; as appears from the following Scriptures; <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> iii. 16.</NOTE> <HI>God &s;o loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, to the End that all who believe in him, &s;hould not peri&s;h but have everla&s;ting Life.</HI> For <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> v. 6. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> <HI>when we were yet without Strength,
<PB REF="005881_0006_102758F5889065E8">
in due Time Chri&s;t died for the Ungodly.</HI> And, <HI>God com|mendeth his Love to us, in that while we were yet Sinners, Chri&s;t died for us.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Chri&s;t's dying for our Sins is the Cau&s;e of the Go&s;|pel's being preach'd to us, as appears from tho&s;e Scriptures, <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Matt.</HI> xxviii. 18.</NOTE> <HI>Je&s;us came and &s;pake unto them, &s;aying, All Power is given unto me in Heaven and Earth. Go ye therefore and teach all Nations.</HI> <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mark</HI> xvi. 15.</NOTE> <HI>Go ye into all the World and preach the Go&s;pel to every Creature.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The Go&s;pel's being preached to Sinners is the Cau&s;e of their believing, as appears from tho&s;e Scriptures, <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> x. 15. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>
<HI>How &s;hall they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how &s;hall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? And how &s;hall they hear without a Preacher? So then Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Men's believing is the Cau&s;e of their Ju&s;tification, as appears from tho&s;e Scriptures, <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Acts</HI> xiii. 39.</NOTE> <HI>By him all that believe are ju&s;tified from all Things.</HI> <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> iii. 26. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> <HI>He is the Ju&s;tifier of all that believe in Je&s;us. Therefore we conclude that a Man is ju&s;tified by Faith, without the Deeds of the Law.</HI> <NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> iv. 3, 23, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> Abra|ham <HI>believed God, and it was imputed to him for Righteou&s;|ne&s;s. Now it was not written for his Sake alone, that it was imputed to him; but for us al&s;o to whom it &s;hall be imputed if we believe on him that rai&s;ed up Je&s;us from the Dead; who was delivered for our Offences, and ro&s;e again for our Ju&s;ti|fication.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Our knowing our&s;elves ju&s;tified by Faith is the Cau&s;e of our Love to Chri&s;t, as appears from the&s;e Scriptures, <NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>John</HI> iv. 10.</NOTE> <HI>Herein is Love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and &s;ent his Son to be the Propitiation for our Sins.</HI> <NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>John</HI> iv. 19.</NOTE>
<HI>We love him, becau&s;e he fir&s;t loved us.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Our Love to Chri&s;t is the Cau&s;e of our obeying him, as appears from tho&s;e Scriptures, <NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> xiv. 15, 21. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> <HI>If ye love me keep my

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> them, he it is that loveth me.</HI> And, <HI>If any Man loveth me he will keep my Words.</HI> <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>John</HI> v. 3.</NOTE> <HI>For this is the Love of God, that we keep his Commandments.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Our obeying Chri&s;t is the Cau&s;e of his giving us eternal Life, as appears from tho&s;e Scriptures, <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Matt.</HI> vii. 21.</NOTE> <HI>Not every one that &s;aith unto me, Lord, Lord, &s;hall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; but he that doth the Will of my Father which is in Heaven.</HI> <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rev.</HI> xxii. 14.</NOTE> <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are they that do his Com|mandments, that they may have Right to the Tree of Life, and may enter in thro' the Gates into the City.</HI> And <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hebr.</HI> v. 9.</NOTE> <HI>Chri&s;t being made perfect thro' Sufferings, he became the Au|thor of eternal Salvation to all that obey him.</HI></P>
<P N="15">15. This may be more briefly expre&s;t thus:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. God's Love was the Cau&s;e of his &s;ending his Son to die for Sinners.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Chri&s;t's dying for Sinners is the Cau&s;e of the Go&s;pel's being preached.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The preaching of the Go&s;pel is the Cau&s;e (or Means) of our believing.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Our believing is the Cau&s;e (or Condition) of our Ju&s;tification.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The knowing our&s;elves ju&s;tified thro' his Blood, is the Cau&s;e of our Love to Chri&s;t.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. Our Love to Chri&s;t is the Cau&s;e of our Obedience to him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. Our Obedience to Chri&s;t is the Cau&s;e of his be|coming the Author of eternal Salvation to us.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="16">16. The&s;e following Things therefore ought well to be con&s;idered by all that fear God.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. There was a Nece&s;&s;ity of God's Love in &s;ending his Son to die for us, without which he had not come to die.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. There was a Nece&s;&s;ity of Chri&s;t's Love in dying for us, without which the Go&s;pel could not have been preached.</ITEM>

<ITEM>4. There is a Nece&s;&s;ity of our believing the Go&s;pel, without which we cannot be ju&s;tified.</ITEM>

<ITEM>8. There is a Nece&s;&s;ity of our keeping his Command|ments, without which we cannot enter into eternal Life.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>By all which we &s;ee, that there is as great a Nece&s;&s;ity of our keeping the Commandments of God, as there was of God's &s;ending his Son into the World, or of Chri&s;t's dying for our Sins.</P>
<P N="17">17 But for who&s;e Sins did Chri&s;t die? Did he die for <HI>All</HI> Men, or but for <HI>Some?</HI></P>
<P>To this I &s;hall an&s;wer by the Scriptures, &s;hewing 1. The Te&s;timony of all the Prophets. 2 Of the Angel of God. 3. Of Chri&s;t him&s;elf. And 4 Of his Apo&s;tles.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> &s;aith thus, <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>I&s;aiah</HI> liii. 4, 5, 6.</NOTE> <HI>Surely he hath born our Griefs, and carried our Sorrows; yet did we e&s;teem him &s;tricken, &s;mitten of God and afflicted. But he was wound|ed for our Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, he was brui&s;ed for our Iniquities, the Cha&s;ti&s;ement of our Peace was upon him, and with his Stripes we are healed. All we, like Sheep, have gone a&s;tray; we have turn'd every one to his own Way; and the Lord hath laid on him the Iniquities of us all.</HI> Thus <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> &s;heweth plainly, that the Iniquities of all tho&s;e who went a&s;tray, were laid upon Chri&s;t. And to him the Te&s;timony of all the other Prophets agreeth: <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Acts</HI> 10.43.</NOTE> <HI>To him give all the Pro|phets Witne&s;s, that thro' his Name who&s;oever believeth in him &s;hall receive Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins.</HI> The &s;ame &s;aith that great
<PB REF="005881_0009_102759018883FA38">
Prophet, <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t, who <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> 1.7.</NOTE> <HI>came to bear Witne&s;s of the Light, that</HI> all Men <HI>thro' it might believe.</HI> And again, <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">v. 29</NOTE> <HI>Behold, &s;aith he, the Lamb of God, that taketh away the Sins</HI> of the World. Thus have all the Prophets with one Con&s;ent te&s;tified, that God <HI>laid upon Chri&s;t the Iniquities of all</HI> that were <HI>gone a&s;tray;</HI> that he is <HI>the Lamb of God, which taketh away the Sins of the World;</HI> that <HI>all Men thro' him may believe;</HI> and that <HI>thro' his Name who&s;oever believeth in him, &s;hall receive Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The Angel of God te&s;tified the &s;ame Thing, &s;aying, <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Luke</HI> ii. 10.</NOTE> <HI>Fear not; for I bring you glad Tidings of great Joy, which &s;hall be to all People,</HI> which was, that there was <HI>born unto them a Saviour, even Chri&s;t the Lord.</HI> By this al&s;o it appears, that Chri&s;t died for all Men For el&s;e it could not have been glad Tidings of great Joy, to all People; but rather &s;ad Tidings to all tho&s;e for whom he died not.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> We come now to the Words of Chri&s;t him&s;elf, who knew his own Bu&s;ine&s;s better than any Man el&s;e; and therefore, if his Te&s;timony agree with the&s;e, we mu&s;t needs be convinced that they are true. Now, he &s;peaks thus, <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> iii. 14. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> <HI>As</HI> Mo&s;es <HI>lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderne&s;s, even &s;o mu&s;t the Son of Man be lifted up, that who&s;oever believeth in him, &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting Life. For God &s;o loved the World that he gave his only begotten Son, that who&s;oever believeth in him &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have ever|la&s;ting Life. For God &s;ent not his Son to condemn the World, but that the World thro' him might be &s;aved.</HI> Thus we &s;ee the Words of Chri&s;t agree with the Words of the Pro|phets; therefore it mu&s;t needs be own'd that Chri&s;t died for all.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> And now we will hear what the Apo&s;tles &s;ay concerning this Thing. <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Cor.</HI> v. 14. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> <HI>The Love of Chri&s;t,</HI> &s;aith the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul, con&s;traineth us, becau&s;e we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead; and that he died for all,
<PB N="10" REF="005881_0010_10275903F7753460">

<P N="18">18. What then can they, who deny this, &s;ay? Why, they commonly &s;ay <HI>All Men,</HI> in the&s;e Scriptures, does not mean <HI>All Men,</HI> but only <HI>The Elect;</HI> that <HI>Every Man</HI> here does not mean <HI>Every Man,</HI> but only every one of the Elect; that <HI>The World</HI> does not mean <HI>the whole World,</HI> but only the World of Believers; and that <HI>the whole World,</HI> in St. <HI>John</HI>'s Words, does not mean <HI>the whole World,</HI> but only, The whole World of the Elect.</P>
<P N="19">19. To this &s;hamele&s;s, &s;en&s;ele&s;s Eva&s;ion, I an&s;wer thus:</P>
<P>If the Scripture no where &s;peaks of a World of Believers or Elect, then we have no Ground, Rea&s;on, Pretence or Excu&s;e for &s;aying, Chri&s;t died only for a World of Be|lievers or Elect. But the Scripture no where &s;peaks of &s;uch a World. Therefore we have no Ground or Pre|tence for &s;peaking thus.</P>
<P>Nay, the Scripture is &s;o far from calling Believers or elected Per&s;ons, <HI>The World,</HI> that they are every where in Scripture plainly and expre&s;ly di&s;tingui&s;hed from <HI>The

World.</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> xv. 19.</NOTE> <HI>If ye were of the World,</HI> &s;aith Chri&s;t, <HI>the World would love its own; but becau&s;e I have cho&s;en you out of the World, therefore the World hateth you.</HI></P>
<P N="20">20. But let the Scripture it&s;elf &s;peak, what World Chri&s;t died for. <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> v. 6, 10</NOTE> <HI>When we were yet without Strength, Chri&s;t died for the Ungodly. While we were yet Sinners, Chri&s;t died for us. When we were Enemies, we were recon|ciled to God by the Death of his Son.</HI> From all which we may clearly &s;ee, that Chri&s;t died for the <HI>World of the Un|godly,</HI> for the <HI>World of Sinners,</HI> for the <HI>World of his Ene|mies;</HI> the Ju&s;t One for the <HI>World of the Unju&s;t.</HI> But the Elect, as Elect, are not unju&s;t. Therefore he died not for the Elect, as Elect; but even for that World, St. <HI>John</HI> &s;peaks of, when he &s;ays, <HI>The whole World lieth in Wicked|ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="21">21. If it be &s;aid, <Q>The Elect were Sinners once as well as others;</Q> I an&s;wer, True; but not <HI>as they are Elect in Chri&s;t,</HI> but as they were <HI>out of Chri&s;t, without Hope and without God in the World.</HI> Therefore, to &s;ay that Chri&s;t died for the Elect, as Elect, is ab&s;olute Non|&s;en&s;e and Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P N="22">22. To put this Matter out of Doubt, I would com|mend the&s;e following Con&s;iderations to all &s;ober-minded Men.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Scripture &s;aith, Chri&s;t <HI>came to &s;eek and to &s;ave that which was lo&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>But the Elect, as Elect, were not lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Therefore Chri&s;t died not for the Elect, as or becau&s;e they were Elect; for that had been to &s;eek and &s;ave what was found and &s;aved before.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Scripture &s;aith, Chri&s;t died for <HI>the Unju&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>But the Elect, as &s;uch, are not unju&s;t.</P>
<P>Therefore, Chri&s;t died not for the Elect, as Elect; for that had been to ju&s;tify them who were ju&s;t before.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Scripture &s;aith, <HI>He came to preach Deliverance to the Captive.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="005881_0012_102759074FB69540">But the Elect, as Elect, are not Captive; for Chri&s;t hath &s;et them free.</P>
<P>Therefore he died not for the Elect, as Elect; for that had been to &s;et them at Liberty who were at Liberty before.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Scripture &s;aith, <HI>He quickened them who were dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins &s;uch as were without Chri&s;t, Aliens from the Common-wealth of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>and Strangers to the Cove|nant of Promi&s;e, without Hope and without God in the World.</HI></P>
<P>But the Elect, as &s;uch, are not <HI>dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins,</HI> but <HI>alive unto God.</HI> Neither are they <HI>without Chri&s;t;</HI> for they are cho&s;en <HI>in him:</HI> Nor are they <HI>Aliens from the Commonwealth of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>and Strangers to the Covenant of Promi&s;e</HI> But they are <HI>Fellow-Citizens with the Saints, and the Hou&s;hold of God.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore Chri&s;t died not for the Elect, as or becau&s;e they were Elect. For that had been to quicken them that were alive before, and to bring them into Covenant, who were in Covenant before. And thus, by the&s;e Men's Account, our Lord lo&s;t his Labour of Love, and accom|pli&s;hed A SOLEMN NOTHING.</P>
<P N="23">23. Thus having &s;hewn the grievous Folly of tho&s;e who &s;ay, that <HI>Chri&s;t died for none but the Elect.</HI> I &s;hall now prove by undeniable Rea&s;ons, that <HI>he died for All Man|kind.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rea&s;.</HI> 1. Becau&s;e all the Prophets, the Angel of God, Chri&s;t him&s;elf, and his holy Apo&s;tles with one Con&s;ent, affirm it.</P>
<P><HI>Rea&s;.</HI> 2. Becau&s;e there is not one Scripture, from the Beginning of <HI>Gene&s;is</HI> to the End of the <HI>Revelation,</HI> that denies it, either negatively, by &s;aying, that <HI>he did not die for all;</HI> or affirmatively, by &s;aying, that <HI>he did die but for &s;ome.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rea&s;.</HI> 3. Becau&s;e he him&s;elf commanded, that the Go&s;|pel &s;hould be preached to <HI>every Creature.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rea&s;.</HI> 4. Becau&s;e <HI>he calleth all Men, every where to repent.</HI></P>

<P N="24">24. I &s;hall now briefly &s;hew the dreadful Ab&s;urdities that follow from &s;aying <HI>Chri&s;t died only for the Elect.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. If Chri&s;t died not for All, then Unbelief is no Sin in them that finally peri&s;h; &s;eeing there is not any Thing for tho&s;e Men to believe unto Salvation, for whom Chri&s;t died not.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. If Chri&s;t died not for All Men, then it would be a Sin in the greate&s;t Part of Mankind to believe he died <HI>for Them;</HI> &s;eeing it would be to believe a Lye.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. If Chri&s;t died not for tho&s;e that are damned, then they are not damned for Unbelief. Otherwi&s;e, you &s;ay, that they are damned for not believing a Lie.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. If Chri&s;t died not for All, then tho&s;e who obey Chri&s;t, by going and preaching the Go&s;pel to every Crea|ture, as glad Tidings of Grace and Peace of great Joy <HI>to all People,</HI> do &s;in thereby, in that they go <HI>to mo&s;t People</HI> with a Lye in their Mouth.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. If Chri&s;t died not for All Men, then God is not in Earne&s;t in <HI>calling all Men every where to repent;</HI> For what good could Repentance do tho&s;e, for whom Chri&s;t died not?</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. If Chri&s;t died not for all, then why does he &s;ay <HI>He is not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h?</HI> Surely he is willing,
<PB N="14" REF="005881_0014_1027590DA76D2F78">
yea re&s;olved that mo&s;t Men &s;hould peri&s;h; el&s;e he would have died for them al&s;o.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. How &s;hall God <HI>judge the World by the Man Chri&s;t-Je&s;us,</HI> if Chri&s;t did not die for the World? Or how &s;hall he judge them <HI>according to the Go&s;pel,</HI> when there was never any Go&s;pel or Mercy for them?</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="25">25. But, &s;ay &s;ome, <Q>If Chri&s;t died for all, why are not all &s;aved?</Q></P>
<P>I an&s;wer, <HI>Becau&s;e they believe not in the Name of the only begotten Son of God.</HI> Becau&s;e God <HI>called, and they refu&s;ed to an&s;wer; he &s;tretch'd out his Hand, and they regarded not; he coun&s;ell'd them, but they would none of his Coun&s;els;</HI> he reproved them, but <HI>they &s;et at nought all his Reproofs; they followed after lying Vanities, and for&s;ook their own Mercies;</HI> they <HI>denied the Lord that bought them, and &s;o brought upon them&s;elves &s;wift De&s;truction;</HI> And <HI>becau&s;e they received not the Love of the Truth, that they might be &s;aved, therefore</HI> (if you would know wherefore) <HI>God gave them up to believe a Lye,</HI> and to be damned. <HI>How often</HI> (&s;aith our Lord) <HI>would I have gathered you together,</HI> and ye would not? <HI>Ye would not.</HI> Here is the plain Rea&s;on, why all Men are not &s;aved. For God promi&s;eth no Man Salvation, whether he will or no. But leaveth them to everla&s;ting De&s;tructi|on, who will not <HI>believe and obey the Go&s;pel.</HI></P>
<P N="26">26. <Q>O, then you are an <HI>Arminian!</HI> You are a <HI>Free|willer.</HI> You hold Free will in Man!</Q></P>
<P>I hold nothing but what the Scripture &s;aith; and that you &s;hall give me Leave to hold. I do not hold, that any Man has any Will or Power of him&s;elf, to do any Thing that is Good; but by the Grace of God we may do all Things. I have already &s;hewn, he hath given Chri&s;t for all Men. And <HI>he who &s;pared not his own Son, but de|livered him up for us all, how &s;hall he not with him freely give us all Things?</HI> And what Man knoweth not, that if he make U&s;e of all the Will and Power God hath given him, God will double his Talent, and give him more? If any therefore de&s;ire to have more, let him faithfully im|prove
<PB N="15" REF="005881_0015_102759122C9B20E0">
what he has. Likewi&s;e what Man is he, who doth not know that he is not condemn'd, <HI>for not doing what he could not do,</HI> but <HI>for leaving undone what he could have done if he would.</HI> Let any Man deny it if he can.</P>
<P N="27">27. "What then, may all Men be &s;aved if they will?"</P>
<P>Before I an&s;wer this Que&s;tion directly, I &s;hall &s;hew that tho&s;e who a&s;k it, are them&s;elves compell'd to grant as much Freedom of Will, as we de&s;ire to plead for.</P>
<P>For 1. The A&s;&s;embly of Divines, in their Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, c. 9. do expre&s;ly &s;ay, <HI>God hath endowed the Will of Man with that natural Liberty, that it is neither forced, nor by any ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity determined to do Good or Evil.</HI> 2. Mr. <HI>Baxter,</HI> in the Preface of his <HI>Call to the Unconverted,</HI> &s;ays, that <HI>Calvin as well as</HI> Arminius <HI>held Free-will,</HI> and that <HI>no Man of Brains denieth, that Man hath a Will that is naturally free; it is free from Violence, it is a &s;elf-deter|mining Principle.</HI> Sure here is as much &s;aid for Free-will, as any Man need to &s;ay, and perhaps more. For,</P>
<P>The Difference between us, is this. They &s;ay, <HI>Man hath a Will which is naturally free.</HI> We &s;ay, <HI>Man hath this Freedom of Will, not naturally, but by Grace.</HI></P>
<P>We believe, that in the Moment <HI>Adam</HI> fell, he had no Freedom of Will left; But that God, when of his own Free Grace he gave the Promi&s;e of a Saviour to him and his Po&s;terity, graciou&s;ly re&s;tored to Mankind a Liberty and Power to accept of proffered Salvation. And in all this, Man's boa&s;ting is excluded; the whole of that which is Good in him, even from the fir&s;t Motion of his Will, being of Grace and not of Nature. And now we come directly to the Que&s;tion, Whether All Men may be &s;aved if they will?</P>
<P N="28">28. To tho&s;e who have con&s;ider'd what has been pre|mi&s;ed; I an&s;wer, 1. What &s;hould hinder them if they be willing? For 2. God is not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h; yea, 3. He is willing that all Men &s;hould be &s;av'd. And Chri&s;t is willing; for he <HI>came not to judge the World, but to &s;ave the World.</HI> And how did he weep over <HI>Jeru&s;alem?</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="005881_0016_102759168B612988">
How often would he have gather'd them together, even as an Hen gathereth her Chickens under her Wings, but they would not? And now, what hinders Mens Salvation, but that &s;ame, <HI>they would not?</HI></P>
<P N="29">29. They would not, they will not come at Chri&s;t's Call, and hearken to his Reproof, and wait for his Coun|&s;els, and receive Power from on high to live to him who died for them, walking in all his Commandments and Ordinances blamele&s;s, and following him whither&s;oever he goeth.
