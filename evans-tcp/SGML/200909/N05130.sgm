<P>TO make Way for, and to pre&s;s to the diligent ob&s;erving the following Directions, let the&s;e three Things be premi&s;ed.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Power of Religion is much fallen, at lea&s;t, is at a &s;tand, among Multitudes of Profe&s;&s;ors of the pre&s;ent Day. Sure this needs no Proof, when we have &s;o many &s;ad ocular Demon&s;trations hereof before us.</P>
<P N="2">2. That for this, the Lord hath a Controver&s;ie with us at this Day, <HI>Rev.</HI> 2.4. Whatever Controver&s;ie the Lord hath with the <HI>Belials</HI> among&s;t us,

<P N="3">3. No Prayers will avail, nor have the lea&s;t Help in them, but the Prayers of &s;uch, with whom the Lord's Contro|ver&s;ie is taken up and compo&s;ed; tho&s;e with whom he hath a particular Quarrel, are like to be unhappy Mediators for others. We chu&s;e the Favourites of Princes to be our Interce&s;&s;ors with them.</P>
<P N="4">4. There can be no taking up GOD's Controver&s;ie, unle&s;s the Matter fit he|re noved, by Repentance and Reforma|tion, <HI>Rev.</HI> 2.5. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 1.15, 16, 18. <HI>When ye make many Prayers. I will not hear, your Hands are full of Blood; wa&s;h ye, make you clean,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Come now and let us Rea&s;on together.</HI> Jo&s;h. 7.10. <HI>Get thee up; wherefore lie&s;t thou thus upon thy Face?

Behold the Wedg of Gold, and the <HI>Babyloni&s;h</HI> Garment, their Pride and their Cove|tou&s;ne&s;s, hid in their Hearts for a Tent. God &s;earch out the&s;e, and every other accur&s;ed Thing within you, let them be de&s;troyed, if ye would have the Lord to be at Peace.</P>
<P N="5">5. If there may be &s;uch a Spirit of Prayer &s;tir'd up among us, as may have its Fruit unto Holine&s;s, and real Refor|mation of the Evils of our Ways; this would Comfort us, and give us great Hopes in the harde&s;t Ca&s;es.</P>
<P N="6">6. Therefore, in all our crying to God for his Help, in Ca&s;e of publick Fears, Dangers or Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, our Eye &s;hould be fir&s;tly upon, and we &s;hould wre&s;tle with the Lord for the pardoning, purging, and Sanctification of our own Hearts and Lives; wherein if we pre|vail not, we &s;hall be as a rotten Tooth, or a Bone out of joynt, for any Help there is in us, or in any Thing we do; unle&s;s we can pray up a Spirit of Holi|ne&s;s in our &s;elves, a Spirit of Love, and

<P N="7">7. 'Tis not praying alone that will do: to the bringing on our Reforma|tion, there mu&s;t be al&s;o a con&s;tant and &s;edulous U&s;e of all God's other Means, in our whole Cour&s;e of Life.</P>
<P N="8">8. Some of the&s;e Means are pre&s;ented in the following Directions.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>General Directions.</HI></P>
<P>Direct. 1. <HI>Take up a deep and &s;erious De&s;ign of making an advance in &s;erious Religion.</HI> Set not down by, take not up with, what you have already attained, but re&s;olve for reaching forward, and following after, towards that which you have not attained; content not your

Say to thine Heart, How is it with me? Doth my Sold pro&s;per? Are my Ways &s;uch as plea&s;e and Lord? What is mine Expectation and mine Hope? What is the Aim and Bu&s;ine&s;s of my Life? is it that Chri&s;t may be magni|fied by me, and that I may be made Partaker of his Holine&s;s, and &s;hew forth his Vertues in my Generation? Can I &s;ay with the Apo&s;tle, <HI>To me to live is Chri&s;t?</HI> Ah Wretch that I am! How deeply hath this Self and this World gone &s;hares with my Lord! O! How little of my Time, my Parts, my Strength, yea, and of my very Heart al&s;o have been inclo&s;ed and con&s;ecrated as Holi|ne&s;s to the Lord? How much of me hath been left out in common for the World? Well, but what meane&s;t thou for the future? Wilt thou henceforth change the purpo&s;e and intent of thine Heart? Come Man, wilt take up a De|&s;ign for, and henceforth centermine, and &s;et thine Heart upon a more watchful, fruitful and heavenly Life? If thou wilt

En|courage your Hearts with the Words of the Apo&s;tle. <HI>Phil.</HI> 4.13. <HI>I &s;hall be able to do all Things through Chri&s;t that &s;trengthens me.</HI></P>

At the Prayers of the Church the iron Gates fly open, and the Apo&s;tles Fetters fall off. Sometimes the Prayers of one Man that hath an eminent Inte|re&s;t in God, are a Means to pre&s;erve a whole Town, yea a whole Land from De|&s;truction.&mdash;</P>
