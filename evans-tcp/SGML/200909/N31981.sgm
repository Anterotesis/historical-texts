<P>IN di&s;cour&s;ing on the&s;e Words, I &s;hall, with the Help of GOD,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. De&s;cribe the Sleepers to whom they are &s;poken.</ITEM>

<ITEM>III. Explain the Promi&s;e made to &s;uch as do awake and ari&s;e, CHRIST <HI>&s;hall give thee Light.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">I. 1. And fir&s;t, as to the Sleepers here &s;poken to. By Sleep is &s;ignified the natural State of Man; that deep Sleep of the Soul into which the Sin of <HI>Adam</HI> hath ca&s;t all who &s;pring from his Loins; that Supinene&s;s, Indolence and Stupidity, that In&s;en&s;ibi|lity of his real Condition, wherein every Man comes into the World, and continues 'till the Voice of GOD awakes him.</P>
<P N="2">2. Now <HI>they that &s;leeps &s;leep in the Night.</HI> The State of Na|ture is a State of utter Darkne&s;s; a State wherein <HI>Darkne&s;s covers the Earth, and gro&s;s Darkne&s;s the People.</HI> The poor unawakened Sinner, how much Knowledge &s;oever he may have, as to other Things, has no Knowledge of him&s;elf: In this Re&s;pect <HI>he know|eth Nothing yet as he ought to know.</HI> He knows not that he is a fallen Spirit, who&s;e only Bu&s;ine&s;s in this pre&s;ent World is to recover from his Fall, to regain that Image of GOD wherein he was created. He &s;ees no <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> for <HI>the one Thing needful,</HI> even that inward univer&s;al Change, that <HI>Birth from above,</HI> (figured out by Bapti&s;m,) which is the Beginning of that total Renovati|on, that Sanctification of Spirit, Soul and Body, <HI>without which no Man &s;hall &s;ee the</HI> LORD.</P>
<P N="3">3. Full of all Di&s;ea&s;es as he is, he fancies him&s;elf in perfect Health: Fa&s;t bound in Mi&s;ery and Iron, he dreams that he is happy, and at Liberty. He &s;ays, Peace, Peace, while the Devil, <HI>as a &s;trong Man armed,</HI> is in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Soul. He &s;leeps on &s;till, and takes his Re&s;t, tho' Hell is moved from beneath to meet him; tho' the Pit, from whence there is no Return, hath opened its Mouth to &s;wallow him up: A Fire is kindled around
<PB N="3" REF="042191_0003_101BA5F99F6F4590">
him, yet he knoweth it not; yea, it burns him, yet he lays it not to Heart.</P>
<P N="4">4. By one who &s;leeps, we are therefore to under&s;tand (and would to GOD we might all under&s;tand it!) a Sinner &s;atisfied in his Sins, contented to remain in his fallen State, to live and die without the Image of GOD: One who is ignorant both of his Di&s;ea&s;e, and of the only Remedy for it: One who never was warned, or never regarded the warning Voice of GOD <HI>to flee from the Wrath to come:</HI> One that never yet &s;aw he was in Danger of Hell-fire, or cried in the Earne&s;tne&s;s of his Soul, <HI>What mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved?</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. If this Sleeper be not outwardly vicious, his Sleep is u&s;u|ally the deepe&s;t of all: Whether he be of the <HI>Laodicean</HI> Spirit, <HI>neither cold nor hot;</HI> but a quiet, rational, inoffen&s;ive, good-na|tured Profe&s;&s;or of the Religion of his Fathers; or whether he be zealous and orthodox, and <HI>after the &s;traite&s;t Sect of our Religion, lives a Phari&s;ee,</HI> that is, according to the &s;criptural Account, one that <HI>ju&s;tifies him&s;elf;</HI> one that labours <HI>to e&s;tabli&s;h his own Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> as the Ground of his Acceptance with GOD.</P>
<P N="6">6. This is he, who, <HI>having the Form of Godline&s;s, denies the Power thereof;</HI> yea, and probably reviles it where&s;oever it is found, as mere Extravagance and Delu&s;ion. Mean-while, the wretched Self-deceiver thanks GOD that <HI>he is not as other Men are; Adulterers, Unju&s;t, Extortioners:</HI> No, he doth no Wrong to any Man. He <HI>fa&s;ts twice in the Week,</HI> u&s;es all the Means of Grace, is con&s;tant at Church and Sacrament; yea, and <HI>gives Tythes of all that he has,</HI> does all the Good that he can: <HI>Touching the Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of the Law,</HI> he is <HI>blamele&s;s:</HI> He wants Nothing of God|line&s;s, but the Power; Nothing of Religion, but the Spirit; Nothing of Chri&s;tianity, but the Truth and the Life.</P>
<P N="7">7. But know ye not, that however highly e&s;teemed among Men, <HI>&s;uch a Chri&s;tian</HI> as this may be, he is an Abomination in the Sight of GOD, and an Heir of every Woe, which the Son of GOD, Ye&s;terday, To-day and for ever, denounces again&s;t <HI>Scribes and Phari&s;ees, Hypocrites?</HI> He hath <HI>made clean the Out&s;ide of the Cup and Platter,</HI> but within is full of all Filthine&s;s. <HI>An evil Di&s;|ea&s;e cleaveth</HI> &s;till <HI>unto him;</HI> &s;o that <HI>his inward Parts are very Wick|edne&s;s.</HI> Our LORD fitly compares him to a <HI>painted Sepulchre,</HI> which <HI>appears beautiful without;</HI> But neverthele&s;s is <HI>full of dead Mens Bones, and of all Uncleanne&s;s.</HI> The Bones indeed are no longer dry; <HI>the Sinews and the Fle&s;h are come upon them, and the Skin covers them above:</HI> But <HI>there is no Breath</HI> in them, no Spi|rit of the Living God. And <HI>if any Man have not the Spirit</HI> of
<PB N="4" REF="042191_0004_101BA5FC61907010">
CHRIST, <HI>he is none of His. Ye are</HI> CHRIST<HI>'s if &s;o be that the Spi|rit of</HI> GOD <HI>dwell in you.</HI> But if not, GOD knoweth that ye a|bide in Death, even until now.</P>
<P N="8">8. This is another Character of the Sleeper here &s;poken to. He abides in Death, tho' he knows it not. He is dead unto GOD, <HI>dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins.</HI> For, <HI>to be carnally mind|ed, is Death.</HI> Even as it is written, <HI>by one Man Sin entered into the World, and Death by Sin: And &s;o Death pa&s;&s;ed upon all Men,</HI> not only temporal Death, but likewi&s;e &s;piritual and eternal. <HI>In the Day thou eate&s;t</HI> (&s;aid GOD to <HI>Adam) thou &s;halt &s;urely die:</HI> Not bodily (unle&s;s as he then became mortal) but &s;piritually: Thou &s;halt lo&s;e the Life of thy Soul: Thou &s;halt die to GOD; &s;hall be &s;eparated from Him thy e&s;&s;ential Life and Happine&s;s.</P>
<P N="9">9. Thus fir&s;t was di&s;&s;olved the vital Union of our Soul with GOD; in&s;omuch that in <HI>the Mid&s;t of</HI> natural <HI>Life we are</HI> now <HI>in</HI> &s;piritual <HI>Death.</HI> And herein we remain, 'till the Second <HI>Adam</HI> becomes a quickning Spirit to us, 'till He rai&s;es the Dead, the Dead in Sin, in Plea&s;ure, Riches, or Honours. But before any dead Soul can live, he hears, (hearkens to) <HI>the Voice of the Son of</HI> GOD: He is made &s;en&s;ible of his lo&s;t E&s;tate, and receives the Sentence of Death in him&s;elf. He knows him&s;elf to be <HI>dead while he liveth,</HI> dead to GOD; and all the Things of GOD: Having no more Power to perform the Actions of a living Chri&s;tian, than a dead Body to perform the Functions of a liv|ing Man.</P>
<P N="10">10. And mo&s;t certain it is, that one dead in Sin, has not his <HI>Sen&s;es exerci&s;ed to di&s;cern</HI> &s;piritual <HI>Good and Evil: Having Eyes he &s;ees not; he hath Ears, and hears not.</HI> He doth not <HI>ta&s;te and &s;ee the</HI> LORD <HI>is gracious.</HI> He <HI>hath not &s;een</HI> GOD <HI>at any Time, nor heard his Voice,</HI> nor <HI>handled the Word of Life.</HI> In vain is the Name of JESUS <HI>like Ointment poured fourth,</HI> and <HI>all his Garments &s;mell of Myrrh, Aloes, and Ca&s;&s;ia.</HI> The Soul that &s;leepeth in Death, hath no Perception of any Objects of this Kind. His Heart is <HI>pa&s;t feeling,</HI> and under&s;tands none of the&s;e Things.</P>
<P N="11">11. And hence, having <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> Sen&s;es, no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">ets of &s;pi|ritual Knowledge, the natural Man receiveth not the Things of the Spirit of GOD: Nay, he is &s;o far from receiving them, that what&s;over is &s;piritually di&s;cerned, is mere Fooli&s;hne&s;s unto him. He is not content with being utterly ignorant of &s;piri|tual Things, but he denies the very Exi&s;tence of them. And &s;piritual Sen&s;ation it&s;elf is to him, the Fooli&s;hne&s;s of Folly. <HI>How,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>can the&s;e Things be?</HI> How can any Man <HI>know</HI> that he is alive to GOD? Even as you know, that your Body is
<PB N="5" REF="042191_0005_101BA5FDEC510438">
now alive? Faith is the Life of the Soul; And if ye have this Life abiding in you, ye want no Mark to evidence it to <HI>your|&s;elf,</HI> but that divine Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, that <HI>Witne&s;s of</HI> GOD, which is more and greater than ten thou&s;and human Witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P N="12">12. If He doth not now bear Witne&s;s with thy Spirit, that thou art a Child of GOD; O that He might convince thee, thou poor unawakened Sinner, by his Demon&s;tration and Pow|er, that thou art a Child of the Devil! O that, as I prophe&s;y, there might now be <HI>a Noi&s;e and a Shaking,</HI> and may <HI>the Bones come together, Bone to his Bone.</HI> Then <HI>come from the four Winds, O Breath, and breathe on the&s;e Slain, that they may live!</HI> And do not ye harden your Hearts, and re&s;i&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t, who even now is come to <HI>convince</HI> you <HI>of Sin, becau&s;e you believe not on the Name of the only begotten Son of</HI> GOD.</P>
<P N="2">II. 1. Wherefore <HI>Awake thou that &s;leepe&s;t, and ari&s;e from the Dead.</HI> GOD calleth thee now by my Mouth; and bids thee know thy&s;elf, thou fallen Spirit; thy true State, and only Concern below. <HI>What meane&s;t thou O Sleeper? Ari&s;e! Call upon thy</HI> GOD <HI>if &s;o be thy</HI> GOD <HI>will think upon thee, that thou peri&s;h not.</HI> A migh|ty Tempe&s;t is &s;tirred up round about thee, and thou art &s;inking into the Depths of Perdition, the Gulph of GOD'S Judgments. If thou would e&s;cape them, ca&s;t thy&s;elf into them. <HI>Judge thy|&s;elf, and thou &s;halt not be judged of the</HI> LORD.</P>
<P N="2">2. Awake, awake! Stand up this Moment, le&s;t thou <HI>drink at the</HI> LORD<HI>'s Hand the Cup of his Fury.</HI> Stir up thy&s;elf <HI>to lay hold on the</HI> LORD, <HI>the</HI> LORD <HI>thy Righteou&s;ne&s;s, mighty to &s;ave! Shake thy&s;elf from the Du&s;t.</HI> At lea&s;t, let the Earthquake of GOD'S Threatnings &s;hake thee. Awake and cry out with the trembling Goaler, <HI>What mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved?</HI> And never re&s;t, 'till thou believe&s;t on the LORD JESUS, with a Faith which is his Gift, by the Operation of his Spirit.</P>
<P N="3">3. If I &s;peak to any one of you more than to another, it is to thee, who thinke&s;t thy&s;elf unconcerned in this Exhortation. <HI>I have a Me&s;&s;age from</HI> GOD <HI>unto thee.</HI> In his Name I <HI>warn</HI> thee <HI>to flee form the Wrath to come.</HI> Thou unholy Soul, &s;ee thy Picture in condemned <HI>Peter,</HI> lying in the dark Dungeon, between the Sol|diers, bound with two Chains, the Keepers before the Door keeping the Pri&s;on. The Night is far &s;pent, the Morning is at Hand when thou art to be brought forth to Execution. And in the&s;e dreadful Circum&s;tances thou art fa&s;t a&s;leep in the Devil's Arms, on the Brink of the Pit, in the Jaws of everla&s;ting De|&s;truction.</P>
<P N="4">4. O may <HI>the Angel of the</HI> LORD <HI>come upon thee, and the Light
<PB N="6" REF="042191_0006_101BA60087EFF798">
&s;hine into thy Pri&s;on!</HI> And maye&s;t thou feel the Stroke of an Al|mighty Hand, rai&s;ing thee with, <HI>Ari&s;e up, quickly gird thy&s;elf, and bind on thy Sandals, ca&s;t thy Garment about thee, and follow me!</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Awake thou everla&s;ting Spirit, out of thy Dream of world|ly Happine&s;s. Did not GOD create thee for Him&s;elf? Then thou can&s;t not re&s;t, 'till thou re&s;te&s;t on Him. Return thou Wan|derer. Fly back to thy Ark. <HI>This is not thy home.</HI> Think not of building Tabernacles here. Thou art but <HI>a Stranger, a Sojourner upon Earth:</HI> A Creature of a Day, but, ju&s;t launching out into an unchangeable State. Make Ha&s;te, Eternity is at Hand. Eternity depends on this Moment. An Eternity of Happine&s;s, or an Eternity of Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P N="6">6. In what State is thy Soul? Was GOD, while I am yet &s;peak|ing, to require it of thee, Art thou ready to meet Death and Judgment? Can&s;t thou &s;tand in his Sight, <HI>who is of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity?</HI> Art thou <HI>meet to be Partaker of the Inheri|tance of the Saints in Light?</HI> Ha&s;t thou <HI>fought a good Fight, and kept the Faith?</HI> Ha&s;t thou &s;ecured <HI>the one Thing needful?</HI> Ha&s;t thou recovered the Image of GOD, even <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s and true Holine&s;s?</HI> Ha&s;t thou <HI>put off the Old Man, and put on the New?</HI> Art thou <HI>cloathed upon with</HI> CHRIST?</P>
<P N="7">7. Ha&s;t thou Oil in thy Lamp? Grace in thy Heart? Do&s;t thou <HI>love the</HI> LORD <HI>thy</HI> GOD, <HI>with all thy Heart, and with all thy Mind, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Strength?</HI> Is <HI>that Mind in thee, which was al&s;o in</HI> CHRIST JESUS? Art thou a Chri&s;tian indeed? That is, a new Creature? <HI>Are old Things pa&s;t away, and all Things become new?</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. Art thou <HI>Partaker of the Divine Nature? Knowe&s;t thou not, that</HI> CHRIST <HI>is in thee, except thou be reprobate?</HI> Knowe&s;t thou, that GOD <HI>dwelleth in thee, and thou in</HI> GOD, <HI>by his Spirit which He hath given thee?</HI> Knowe&s;t thou not, that <HI>thy Body is a Temple of the Holy Gho&s;t, which thou ha&s;t of</HI> GOD? Ha&s;t thou the <HI>Witne&s;s in thy&s;elf? The Earne&s;t of thine Inheritance?</HI> Art thou <HI>&s;ealed by that Spirit of Promi&s;e, unto the Day of Redemption?</HI> Ha&s;t thou <HI>received the Holy Gho&s;t?</HI>&mdash;Or do&s;t thou &s;tart at the Que&s;tion, not knowing whether there be any Holy Gho&s;t?</P>
<P N="9">9. If it offends thee, be thou a&s;&s;ured, that thou neither art a Chri&s;tian, nor de&s;ire&s;t to be one. Nay, thy <HI>very Prayer is turned into Sin;</HI> and thou ha&s;t &s;olemnly mocked GOD this very Day, by praying for the In&s;piration of his holy Spirit, when thou did&s;t not believe there was any &s;uch Thing to be received.</P>
<P N="10">10. Yet on the Authority of God's Word, and our own
<PB N="7" REF="042191_0007_101BA605EE6B6C40">
Church, I mu&s;t repeat the Que&s;tion, <HI>Ha&s;t thou received the Holy Gho&s;t?</HI> If thou ha&s;t not, thou art not yet a Chri&s;tian: For a Chri&s;tian is a Man that is <HI>anointed with the Holy Gho&s;t, and with Power.</HI> Thou art not yet made a Partaker of the pure Religion, and undefiled. Do&s;t thou know what Religion is? That it is a Participation of Divine Nature: The Life of GOD in the Soul of Man: CHRIST <HI>in thee, the Hope of Glory:</HI> Happine&s;s and Holine&s;s: Heaven begun upon Earth: <HI>A Kingdom of</HI> GOD <HI>within thee; not Meat and Drink;</HI> no outward Thing; <HI>but Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Gho&s;t?</HI> An everla&s;ting Kingdom brought into thy Soul, a <HI>Peace of</HI> GOD, <HI>that pa&s;&s;eth all Under&s;tanding; a Joy un&s;peakable, and full of Glory?</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. Knowe&s;t thou, that in JESUS CHRIST, <HI>neither Circumci&s;i|on availeth any Thing, or Uncircumci&s;ion; but Faith that worketh by Love;</HI> but a new Creation: See&s;t thou the Nece&s;&s;ity of that in|ward Change, that &s;piritual Birth, that Life from the Dead, that Holine&s;s? And art thou throughly convinced, that <HI>without it, no Man &s;hall &s;ee the</HI> LORD? Art thou labouring after it? <HI>Giving all Diligence to make thy Calling and Election &s;ure? Working out thy Salvation with Fear and Trembling? Agonizing to enter in at the &s;trait Gate?</HI> Art thou <HI>in earne&s;t</HI> about thy Soul? And can&s;t thou tell the Searcher of Hearts, <HI>Thou, O</HI> GOD <HI>art the Thing that I long for!</HI> LORD, Thou knowe&s;t all Things, Thou knowe&s;t that I <HI>would</HI> love thee!</P>
<P N="12">12. Thou hope&s;t to be &s;aved&mdash;but what Rea&s;on ha&s;t thou to give of the Hope that is in thee? Is it becau&s;e thou ha&s;t done no Harm? Or becau&s;e thou ha&s;t done much Good? Or becau&s;e thou art not like other Men; but wi&s;e, or learned, or hone&s;t and morally good? E&s;teemed of Men, or of a fair Reputation? Alas, all this will never bring thee to GOD. It is in his Ac|count lighter than Vanity. Do&s;t thou <HI>know</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>whom he hath &s;ent&punc;</HI> Hath he taught thee, that <HI>by Grace we are &s;aved, thro' Faith; and that, not of our&s;elves; it is the Gift of</HI> GOD; <HI>Not of Works, le&s;t any Man &s;hould boa&s;t?</HI> Ha&s;t thou re|ceived the faithful Saying, as the whole Foundation of thy Hope, <HI>that</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>came into the World to &s;ave Sinners!</HI> Ha&s;t thou learnt what that meaneth, <HI>I came not to call the Righteous, but Sinners, to Repentance? I am not &s;ent but to the lo&s;t Sheep? Art</HI> thou (he that heareth, let him under&s;tand) lo&s;t, dead? <HI>Damned already?</HI>&mdash;Do&s;t thou know thy De&s;erts? Do&s;t thou feel thy Wants? Art thou <HI>poor in Spirit? Mourning for</HI> GOD, and refu&s;ing to be comforted? Is the Prodigal <HI>come to him&s;elf,</HI> and well con|tent to be therefore thought <HI>be&s;ide him&s;elf,</HI> by tho&s;e who are &s;till
<PB N="8" REF="042191_0008_101BA60B39650610">
feeding upon the Hu&s;ks which he had left? Art thou willing to <HI>live godly in</HI> CHRIST JESUS? And do&s;t thou therefore <HI>&s;uffer Per|&s;ecution?</HI> Do <HI>Men &s;ay all Manner of Evil again&s;t thee fal&s;ly, for the Son of Man's Sake?</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. O that in all the&s;e Que&s;tions ye may hear the Voice that wakes the Dead, and feel that Hammer of the Word, Which <HI>breaketh the Rock in Pieces!&mdash;If ye will hear his Voice To-day, while it is called To-day, harden not your Hearts.</HI> Now <HI>awake thou that &s;leepe&s;t</HI> in &s;piritual Death, that thou &s;leep not in Death eternal! Feel thy lo&s;t E&s;tate, and <HI>ari&s;e from the Dead.</HI> Leave thine own Companions in Sin and Death. Follow thou JESUS, and <HI>let the Dead bury the Dead. Save thy&s;elf from this untoward Generation. Come out from among them, and be thou &s;eparate, and touch not the un|clean Thing, and the</HI> LORD <HI>&s;hall receive thee.</HI> CHRIST <HI>&s;hall give thee Light.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. 1. This Promi&s;e I come, la&s;tly, to explain. And how encouraging a Con&s;ideration is this, That who&s;oever thou art who obeye&s;t his Call, thou can&s;t not &s;eek his Face in vain. If thou even now <HI>awake&s;t, and ari&s;e&s;t from the Dead.</HI> He hath bound him&s;elf to <HI>give thee Light. The</HI> LORD <HI>&s;hall give</HI> thee <HI>Grace and Glory;</HI> the Light of his Grace here, and the Light of his Glo|ry, when thou receive&s;t the <HI>Crown that fadeth not away.</HI> Thy Light <HI>&s;hall break forth as the Morning, and thy Darkne&s;s be as the Noon-Day.</HI> GOD, <HI>who commandeth the Light to &s;hine out of Dark|ne&s;s,</HI> &s;hall <HI>&s;hine in thy Heart, to give the Knowledge of the Glory of</HI> GOD <HI>in the Face of</HI> JESUS CHRIST. <HI>On them that fear the</HI> LORD, <HI>&s;hall the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s ari&s;e, with healing in his Wings.</HI> And <HI>in that Day it &s;hall be &s;aid unto thee, Ari&s;e, &s;hine; for thy Light is come, and the Glory of the</HI> LORD <HI>is ari&s;en upon thee.</HI> For CHRIST <HI>&s;hall</HI> reveal him&s;elf in thee. And he is the <HI>true Light.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. GOD is the Light, and will give him&s;elf to every awak|ened Sinner that waiteth for Him: And thou &s;halt then be a Temple of the living GOD, and CHRIST &s;hall <HI>dwell in the Heart of Faith:</HI> And <HI>being rooted and grounded in Love, thou &s;halt be a|ble to comprehend with all Saints, what is the Breadth, and Length and Heighth of that Love of</HI> CHRIST <HI>which pa&s;&s;eth Knowledge, that thou may&s;t be filled with all the Fullne&s;s of</HI> GOD.</P>
<P N="3">3. Ye &s;ee your Calling, Brethren. We are called to be <HI>an Habitation of</HI> GOD <HI>through his Spirit: And thro' his Spirit dwel|ling in us, to be Saints</HI> here, <HI>and Partakers of the Saints in Light.</HI> So <HI>exceeding great</HI> are the <HI>Promi&s;es which are given unto us,</HI> ac|tually given unto us who believe. For by Faith <HI>we receieve not the Spirit of the World, but the Spirit which is of</HI> GOD, the Sum
<PB N="9" REF="042191_0009_101BA60CD390B678">
of all the Promi&s;es, <HI>that we may know the Things that are freely given to us of</HI> GOD.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Spirit of CHRIST is that great Gift of GOD, which at &s;undry Times, and in divers Manners He hath promi&s;ed to Man, and hath fully be&s;towed &s;ince the Time that CHRIST was glorified. Tho&s;e Promi&s;es before made by the Father, he hath thus fulfilled; <HI>I will put my Spirit within you, and cau&s;e you to walk in my Statutes</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ezek.</HI> xxxvi. 27.</NOTE>. <HI>I will pour Water upon him that is thir|&s;ty, and Floods upon the dry Ground: I will pour my Spirit upon thy Seed, and my Ble&s;&s;ings upon thine Offspring</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>I&s;aiah</HI> xliv. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="5">5. Ye may be all living Witne&s;&s;es of the&s;e Things: Of Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins, and the Gift of the Holy Gho&s;t. <HI>If thou can&s;t believe, all Things are po&s;&s;ible to him that believeth. Who a|mong you is there that feareth the</HI> LORD, and yet <HI>walketh in Dark|ne&s;s, and hath no Light?</HI> I a&s;k thee in the Name of JESUS, Be|lieve&s;t thou that <HI>his Arm is not &s;hortened at all?</HI> That He is &s;till <HI>mighty to &s;ave?</HI> That He is <HI>the &s;ame Ye&s;terday, To-day, and for ever?</HI> That He hath <HI>now</HI> Power <HI>on Earth</HI> to forgive Sins? <HI>Son, be of good Chear, thy Sins are forgiven.</HI> GOD for CHRIST'S Sake hath forgiven thee. Receive this, <HI>not as the Word of Man; but as it is, indeed, the Word of</HI> GOD; and thou art <HI>ju&s;tified freely thro' Faith.</HI> Thou &s;halt be &s;anctified al&s;o thro' Faith which is in JESUS, and &s;hall &s;et to thy Seal, even thine, that GOD <HI>hath</HI> giv|en unto us <HI>eternal Life, and this Life is in his Son.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Men and Brethren, let me freely &s;peak unto you: And <HI>&s;uffer ye the Word of Exhortation,</HI> even from one the lea&s;t e&s;teemed in the Church. Your Con&s;cience beareth you Witne&s;s in the Holy Gho&s;t, that the&s;e Things are &s;o, <HI>if &s;o be ye have ta&s;ted that the</HI> LORD <HI>is gracious. This is eternal Life, to know the only true</HI> GOD, <HI>and</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>whom He hath &s;ent.</HI> This is ex|perimental Knowledge, and this alone is true Chri&s;tianity. He is a Chri&s;tian, who hath received the Spirit of CHRIST. He is not a Chri&s;tian, who hath not received Him. Neither is it po&s;&s;ible to have received Him, and not know it. For <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> xiv. 20.</NOTE> <HI>at that Day</HI> (when He cometh, &s;aith the LORD) <HI>ye &s;hall know, that I am in my Father, and you in Me, and I in you.</HI> This is <HI>that Spi|rit of Truth, whom the World cannot receive, becau&s;e it &s;eeth Him not, neither knoweth Him: But ye know Him: for he dwelleth with you, and &s;hall be in you.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. The World cannot receive Him, but utterly rejecteth the Promi&s;e of the Father, contradicting and bla&s;pheming. But e|very Spirit which confe&s;&s;eth not this, is not of GOD. Yea,
<PB N="10" REF="042191_0010_101BA60E70940900">
<HI>this is that Spirit of Antichri&s;t, whereof ye have heard, that it &s;hould come into the World, and even now it is in the World.</HI> He is Antichri&s;t, who&s;oever denies the In&s;piration of the Holy Gho&s;t, or that the indwelling Spirit of GOD is the common Privilege of all Believers, the Ble&s;&s;ings of the Go&s;pel, the un&s;peakable Gift, the univer&s;al Promi&s;e, the Criterion of a real Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P N="8">8. It nothing helps them to &s;ay, <Q>We do not deny the A&s;|&s;i&s;tance of GOD'S Spirit; but only this <HI>In&s;piration,</HI> this <HI>re|ceiving the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> and being <HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> of it. It is only this <HI>feeling of this</HI> Spirit, this being <HI>moved</HI> by the Spirit, or <HI>filled</HI> with it, which we deny to have any Place in &s;ound Religion.</Q> But in <HI>only denying this,</HI> you deny the whole Scriptures, the whole Truth and Promi&s;e and Te&s;timony of GOD.</P>
<P N="9">9. Our own excellent Church knows nothing of this devili&s;h Di&s;tinction: But &s;peaks plainly of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Art.</HI> 17.</NOTE> <HI>feeling the Spirit of</HI> CHRIST; of being <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Office of con&s;ecrating Prie&s;ts.</NOTE> <HI>moved by the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> and knowing and <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vi&s;itation of the Sick.</NOTE> <HI>feeling there is no other Name than that of</HI> JESUS, whereby we can re|ceive any Salvation. She teaches us al&s;o to pray for the <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Collect before the Holy Communion.</NOTE> <HI>In&s;pi|ration of the Holy Spirit;</HI> yea that we may be <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Order of Confirmation.</NOTE> <HI>filled with the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> Nay, and every Pre&s;byter of her's, profe&s;&s;es to <HI>receive the Holy Gho&s;t, by the Impo&s;ition of Hands.</HI> Therefore to deny any of the&s;e, is, in Effect, to renounce the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as well as the whole Chri&s;tian Revelation.</P>
<P N="10">10. But the <HI>Wi&s;dom of</HI> GOD was always <HI>Fooli&s;hne&s;s with Men.</HI> No marvel then, that the great My&s;tery of the Go&s;pel &s;hould be now al&s;o <HI>hid from the Wi&s;e and Prudent,</HI> as well as in the Days of Old; that it &s;hould be almo&s;t univer&s;ally denied, ridiculed and exploded as mere Frenzy: And all who dare avow it &s;till, branded with the Names of Madmen and Enthu&s;ia&s;ts. This is <HI>that falling away</HI> which was to come: The general Apo&s;tacy, of all Orders and Degrees of Men, which we even now find to have over&s;pread the Earth. <HI>Run to and fro in the &s;treets of</HI> Je|ru&s;alem, <HI>and &s;ee if you can find a Man;</HI> a Man that loveth the LORD his GOD with all his Heart, and &s;erveth him with all his Strength; How does our own Land mourn (that we look no far|ther) under the Overflowings of Ungodline&s;s? What Villanies of every Kind are committed Day by Day? Yea, too often with Impunity, by tho&s;e who &s;in with a high Hand, and glory in their Same? Who can reckon up the Oaths, Cur&s;es, Profane|ne&s;s, Bla&s;phemies, the Lying, Slandering, Evil-&s;peaking, the Sabbath-breaking, Gluttony, Drunkenne&s;s, Revenge, the
<PB N="11" REF="042191_0011_101BA6132F6EEDD8">
Whoredoms, Adulteries, and various Uncleanne&s;s, the Frauds, Inju&s;tice, Oppre&s;&s;ion, Extortion which over&s;pread our Land as a Flood?</P>
<P N="11">11. And even among tho&s;e who have kept them&s;elves pure from tho&s;e gro&s;&s;er Abominations, how much Anger and Pride, how much Sloth and Idlene&s;s, how much Softne&s;s and Effemi|nacy, how much Luxury and Self-indulgence, how much Covet|ou&s;ne&s;s and Ambition, how much Thir&s;t of Prai&s;e, how much Love of the World, how much Fear of Man is to be found? Mean while, how little of true Religion? For where is he that loveth either GOD or his Neighbour; as He hath given us Com|mandment? On the one Hand are tho&s;e, who have not &s;o much as the Form of Godline&s;s: On the other, tho&s;e who have the Form only: There &s;tands the <HI>open,</HI> there the <HI>painted</HI> Sepulchre. So that in very Deed, who&s;oever were earne&s;tly to behold any publick gathering togethether of the People, (I fear tho&s;e in our Churches, are not to be excepted) might ea&s;ily perceive, <HI>that the one Part were Sadduces, and the other Phari&s;ees:</HI> The one having almo&s;t as little Concern about Religion, as if there were no <HI>Re&s;urrection, neither Angel, nor Spirit:</HI> and the other making it a mere lifele&s;s Form, a dull round of external Per|formances, without either true Faith, or the Love of GOD, or Joy in the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P N="12">12. Would to GOD I could except us of this Place, Bre|thren, my Heart's De&s;ire, and Prayer to GOD for you is, that ye may be &s;aved from this Overflowing of Ungodline&s;s, and that here may its proud Waves be &s;tay'd! But is it &s;o indeed? GOD knoweth, yea, and our own Con&s;cience, it is not. We have not kept our&s;elves pure. Corrupt are we al&s;o, and abomina|ble; and few are there that under&s;tand any more, few that wor&s;hip GOD in Spirit and in Truth. We too are <HI>a Generation that &s;et not our Hearts aright, and who&s;e Spirit cleaveth not &s;tedfa&s;tly unto</HI> GOD. He hath appointed us indeed, to be <HI>the Salt of the Earth: But if the Salt hath lo&s;t its Savour, it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be ca&s;t out, and to be trodden under Foot of Men.</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. And <HI>&s;hall I not vi&s;it for the&s;e Things, &s;aith the</HI> LORD? <HI>Shall not my Soul be avenged on &s;uch a Nation as this?</HI> Yea we know not how &s;oon He may &s;ay to the Sword, <HI>Sword, go through this Land!</HI> He hath given us a long Space to repent. He lets alone this Year al&s;o: But He warns and awakens us by Thunder. His Judgments are abroad in the Earth. And we have all Rea&s;on to expect that heavie&s;t of all, even <HI>that He &s;hould come unto us quickly, and remove our Candle&s;tick out of its Place, ex|cept
<PB N="12" REF="042191_0012_101BA617323C36D8">
we repent and do the fir&s;t Works:</HI> Unle&s;s we return to the Principles of the Reformation, the Truth and Simplicity of the Go&s;pel. Perhaps we are now re&s;i&s;ting the la&s;t Effort of divine Grace to &s;ave us. Perhaps we have well nigh <HI>filled the Mea|&s;ures of our Iniquities,</HI> by rejecting the Council of GOD again&s;t our&s;elves, and ca&s;ting out his Me&s;&s;engers.</P>
<P N="14">14. <HI>O God, in the mid&s;t of Wrath remember Mercy!</HI> Be glorified in our Reformation, not in our De&s;truction! Let <HI>us hear the Rod, and him that appointed it.</HI> Now that <HI>thy Judgments are a|broad in the Earth,</HI> let the <HI>Inhabitants of the World learn Righteous|ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="15">15. My Brethren, it is high Time for us to awake out of Sleep, before the <HI>great Trumpet of the</HI> LORD <HI>be blown,</HI> and our Land become a Field of Blood. O may we &s;peedily &s;ee the Things that make for our Peace before they are hid from our Eyes! <HI>Turn Thou us, O good</HI> LORD, <HI>and let thine Anger cea&s;e from us. O</HI> LORD <HI>look down from Heaven, behold and vi&s;it this Vine;</HI> and cau&s;e us to know the Time of our Vi&s;itation. <HI>Help us, O</HI> GOD <HI>of our Salvation, for the Glory of thy Name: O deliver us, and be merciful to our Sins, for thy Name's Sake: And &s;o will we not go back from Thee. O let us live and we &s;hall call upon thy Name. Turn us again, O</HI> LORD GOD <HI>of Ho&s;ts, &s;hew the Light of thy Countenance, and we &s;hall be whole.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Now unto Him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can a&s;k or think, according to the Power that worketh in us, unto Him be Glory in the Church by</HI> CHRIST JESUS <HI>throughout all Ages, World without End,</HI> Amen.</P>
