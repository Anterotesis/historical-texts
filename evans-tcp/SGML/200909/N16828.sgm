Jude <HI>4, 16.</HI> With &s;uch, nothing can be too bad to &s;ay of any who expo&s;e their darling errors, while they will not allow us to be charitable, if we cannot think them all to be good men, whom they ad|mire.

<HEAD>PARTICULAR ELECTION AND FINAL PERSEVERANCE <HI>VINDICATED.</HI></HEAD>
<P>CONTROVERSY is generally complained of, and peace is earne&s;tly &s;ought; but often in a way, which denies to all others the liberty we claim for our&s;elves. The revealed will of God is the only perfect law of liberty; but how little is it believed and obeyed by mankind. Both the Hebrew and Chri&s;tian churches, were to be wholly governed by it; and when the fir&s;t King of I&s;rael pre&s;umed to violate a plain command of God, and then thought to atone for it by acts of wor&s;hip, he was guilty of <HI>rebellion,</HI> which is as the &s;in of <HI>witchcraft.</HI> 1 Sam. xv. 23. And in like way My&s;tery Babylon, by her <HI>&s;orceries, has deceived all nations,</HI> and in her was found the <HI>blood of prophets,</HI> and <HI>of &s;aints, and of all that were &s;lain upon the earth.</HI> Rev. xviii. 23, 24. Yet the&s;e exten&s;ive terms are &s;o limited by carnal rea&s;oners, that none of them, in any nation, will allow them&s;elves to be of that bloody city. And at the &s;ame time they are for extending general words of grace, beyond any li|mits; and are ready to accu&s;e us with making God deceitful, if we hold that he did not de&s;ign the merits of his Son, equally for all mankind. If we enquire then, why all are not &s;aved? the general
<PB N="4" REF="021663_0004_0FB500C6EF9B5120">an&s;wer is, that they would not receive that &s;alva|tion; or if they did for a while, and then turned away from it, God rejects and de&s;troys them there|for. We readily grant that God always rewards the righteous, and never de&s;troys any for any thing but &s;in and iniquity; but this cannot content many, without we will allow that grace hath put power into the wills of all mankind, to become righteous, and to obtain &s;alvation, when they &s;hall plea&s;e to &s;et about it in earne&s;t. The fruit of which is, that men <HI>neglect the great &s;alvation, becau&s;e they love dark|ne&s;s rather than light. Yea, every one that doeth evil, hateth the light.</HI> Heb. ii. 3. John iii. 19, 20. And when any are brought to obey the truth, and &s;o come to the light, every art is made u&s;e of, to get them into darkne&s;s again, if po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>This has been remarkably the ca&s;e in the &s;outh|ern parts of America. Many of their teachers were &s;o dark as to &s;wear profanely, drink to exce&s;s, and follow gaming; and at the &s;ame time to preach up <HI>do and live</HI> to their people. But the light of the pure go&s;pel, produced &s;ome reformation among them above forty years ago; and it has greatly in|crea&s;ed &s;ince 1768, as I was well informed, when I was called to travel and preach in Virginia and North-Carolina, la&s;t winter. But after this refor|mation had &s;pread exten&s;ively, the followers of Mr. John We&s;ley introduced his writings again&s;t par|ticular election and final per&s;everance, and thereby greatly ob&s;tructed the work. I was therefore re|que&s;ted to publi&s;h a brief an&s;wer thereto. His fir&s;t piece on that &s;ubject, was publi&s;hed above fifty years ago, under the title of <HI>Free grace,</HI> and it was clo&s;ed with a hymn called, <HI>Univer&s;al redemption,</HI> and therein he &s;ays,</P>
<Q><PB N="5" REF="021663_0005_0FB500C7C1E0ED30">
<L>Thine eye &s;urvey'd the fallen race,</L>
<L>When &s;unk in &s;in they lay,</L>
<L>Their mi&s;ery call'd for all thy grace,</L>
<L>But Ju&s;tice &s;top'd the way.</L>
<L>Mercy the fatal bar remov'd,</L>
<L>Thy only Son it gave,</L>
<L>To &s;ave a world &s;o dearly lov'd,</L>
<L>A &s;inful world to &s;ave.</L>
<L>For every man he ta&s;ted death,</L>
<L>He &s;uffered once for all,</L>
<L>He calls as many &s;ouls as breathe,</L>
<L>And all <HI>may</HI> hear the call.</L>
<L>A power to chu&s;e, a will t'obey,</L>
<L>Freely his grace <HI>re&s;tores;</HI></L>
<L>We all may find the living way,</L>
<L>And call the Saviour ours.</L></Q>
<P>He denied that man had any <HI>natural</HI> liberty of will left, after the fall, until it was <HI>re&s;tored</HI> by grace. This he more explicitly did in a pamphlet on pre|de&s;tination, election and reprobation, publi&s;hed in 1776; and &s;aid upon it, "We believe, that in the moment Adam fell, he had no freedom of will left; but that God, when of his own free grace he gave the promi&s;e of a Saviour to him and his po&s;te|rity, graciou&s;ly re&s;tored to mankind a liberty and power to accept of proffered &s;alvation." P. 16. But if the fall took all <HI>natural</HI> liberty of choice from man, until grace re&s;tored it, then the fall relea&s;ed him from the authority of the law of God, as it was fir&s;t given to him, and he never hath been under it &s;ince, but under grace. The bea&s;ts are not under that law, becau&s;e they never had the powers of thinking and choice, as rational creatures have; and if men are not under that law, what are they better then bea&s;ts? Yea, do they not <HI>corrupt</HI> them|&s;elves
<PB N="6" REF="021663_0006_0FB500D0055D0FE8">more than brute bea&s;ts, that know and obey their owners? Jude, 10. I&s;aiah i. 2&mdash;4. And if all freedom of will is from grace, then it is only by grace that any have power to &s;in again&s;t God, as none can &s;in again&s;t him who have no natural li|berty of will. This opinion is mo&s;t plainly con|futed by the ca&s;e of the fallen angels, who ne|ver had any grace revealed to them; yet the <HI>de|vil &s;inneth from the beginning,</HI> and all wilful &s;inners are <HI>children of the devil,</HI> in oppo&s;ition to all tho&s;e who are <HI>born of God.</HI> John iii. 8&mdash;10. In the &s;ame book Mr. We&s;ley &s;ays,

<P>And is not this a going about to e&s;tabli&s;h our own righteou&s;ne&s;s? For Mo&s;es de&s;cribeth the righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of the law, <HI>That the man who doth tho&s;e things, &s;hall live by them.</HI> This is a <HI>zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.</HI> Rom. x. 2&mdash;5. Mr. We&s;ley goes on to &s;ay, "I &s;hall now briefly &s;hew the dreadful ab&s;urdities that follow from &s;aying <HI>Chri&s;t died only for the elect.</HI>

<ITEM>If Chri&s;t died not for all, then unbelief is no &s;in in them that finally peri&s;h; &s;eeing there is not any thing for tho&s;e men to believe unto &s;alvation for whom Chri&s;t died not.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. If Chri&s;t died not for all men,
<PB N="7" REF="021663_0007_0FB500D960AD3818">then it would be a &s;in in the greate&s;t part of man|kind to believe he died <HI>for them;</HI> &s;eeing it would be to believe a lie.</ITEM>

<ITEM>5. If Chri&s;t died not for all men, then God is not in earne&s;t in <HI>calling all men every where to repent;</HI> for what good could repentance do tho&s;e, for whom Chri&s;t died not?</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. If Chri&s;t died not for all, then why does he &s;ay, <HI>He is not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h?</HI> Surely he is willing, yea re&s;olved that mo&s;t men &s;hould peri&s;h; el&s;e he would have died for them al&s;o.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. How &s;hall God judge the world by the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us, if Chri&s;t did not die for the world? or how &s;hall he judge them according to the go&s;pel, when there was never any go&s;pel or mercy for them?"</ITEM>
</LIST>
P. 14.</P>
<P>An&s;wer, If Chri&s;t died with a de&s;ign to &s;ave all men, why are not all &s;aved? Can the devil cheat him of a great part of his purcha&s;e? Or can men defeat his merciful de&s;igns? No, &s;ay many, he died for all, and he will finally &s;ave all. Others go farther, and conclude that a God of infinite goodne&s;s could not give exi&s;tence to any creature that &s;hall be mi&s;erable without end; but that he will finally deliver every child of Adam from hell, though many of them will be tormented therein for <HI>ages of ages.</HI> But how is their deceit here di&s;|covered? Fallen angels were as really the creatures of God, as fallen men; yet no &s;alvation was ever
<PB N="8" REF="021663_0008_0FB500E1E711E848">revealed for them, but they are re&s;erved in ever|la&s;ting chains under darkne&s;s, unto the judgement of the great day. And this is a clear evidence again&s;t ungodly men, who turn grace into la&s;civi|ou&s;ne&s;s. Jude 4, 6. God was &s;o far from ever proclaiming atonement to all men, without any exception, that he &s;aid, <HI>The &s;oul that doth ought pre&s;umptuou&s;ly, the &s;ame reproacheth the Lord; and that &s;oul &s;hall be cut off from among his people.</HI> And for &s;uch pre&s;umption, Korah and his company pe|ri&s;hed mo&s;t terribly. Num. xv. 30. xvi. 1&mdash;3, 31&mdash;34. And teachers who privily brought dam|nable here&s;ies into the Chri&s;tian church, were <HI>pre|&s;umptuous</HI> and <HI>&s;elf-willed,</HI> under the name of <HI>liber|ty.</HI> They <HI>de&s;pi&s;ed government,</HI> and <HI>peri&s;hed in the gain&s;aying of Core.</HI> 2 Peter, ii. 1, 10, 19. Jude 11. For if the inability of debtors and criminals, could relea&s;e them from the authority of the laws, until rulers would give them power to bring the government to their own terms, how would all <HI>dominion be de&s;pi&s;ed!</HI> The&s;e <HI>filthy dreamers</HI> have now filled the world with Babylonian confu&s;ion. Jude 8. The Jews called it <HI>here&s;y</HI> in Paul, to be|lieve in and obey Je&s;us, as a lawgiver above Mo&s;es. Acts xxiv. 14. And this is the fir&s;t place where the word here&s;y is u&s;ed in the Bible; and if we ob&s;erve what is &s;aid in the la&s;t chapter in it, of ev|ery man who &s;hall add to, or take from its words, mu&s;t we not conclude that all men who do &s;o, and violently impo&s;e their inventions upon others, are guilty of here&s;y? The head of the church of Rome a&s;&s;umed God's place in the church, and exalted him&s;elf above God, who never could violate his <HI>promi&s;e</HI> or his <HI>oath,</HI> or <HI>entice</HI> any into &s;in; and how ju&s;tly are all tho&s;e given up to &s;trong delu&s;ion, who
<PB N="9" REF="021663_0009_0FB500E2F4F937E0">practi&s;e either of the&s;e evils? 2 The&s;&s;. ii. 3&mdash;12. Heb. vi. 18. James i. 13&mdash;15. And how happy &s;hould we &s;oon be, if the&s;e iniquities were exclud|ed from our land?</P>
<P>True believers are &s;o far from pre&s;uming upon the &s;ecret de&s;igns of God, that when the &s;ame are revealed, they dare not make his de&s;igns, but his laws, the rule of their conduct. Though his de|&s;ign of removing Saul, and making David King over I&s;rael, was clearly revealed, yet David refu&s;ed to kill Saul, when greatly provoked thereto, becau&s;e he had no direction to do it. Neither did David a&s;&s;ume the regal power over I&s;rael, until each tribe freely received him as their King by a &s;olemn covenant. But the envious Jews, no &s;ooner had it declared to them, that Je&s;us was to die for that nation, than from that day forth, they took coun&s;el together for to put him to death. John xi. 53. Hereby we may &s;ee the plain difference between true believers and reprobates. For unto the pure all things are pure; but unto the defiled and un|believing, is nothing pure; but even their mind and con&s;cience is defiled. They profe&s;s that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and di&s;obedient, and unto every good work <HI>reprobate.</HI> Titus i. 15, 16. In this way, teachers who turn grace into la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s, deny the only Lord God, and our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Jude 4. But many are deceived by them, becau&s;e in words they profe&s;s to know him. Since Chri&s;t was exalted to the right hand of the Father, his only prie&s;ts upon earth, are <HI>elect</HI> according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through &s;ancti|fication of the Spirit unto obedience, and &s;prink|ling of the blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.&mdash;Being born
<PB N="10" REF="021663_0010_0FB500E44C64E9A0">again, not of corruptible &s;eed, but incorruptible, by the word of God which liveth and abideth for|ever. The&s;e are a <HI>cho&s;en</HI> generation, a royal prie&s;t|hood, an holy nation, a peculiar people, that they &s;hould &s;hew forth the prai&s;es of him who hath call|ed them out of darkne&s;s into his marvellous light. 1 Peter, i. 2, 23. ii. 5, 9. But Mr. We&s;ley, in his piece on prede&s;tination, election, and reproba|tion, &s;ays, "They were cho&s;en through belief of the truth, and called to believe it by the go&s;pel; therefore they were not cho&s;en before they be|lieved, much le&s;s before they had a being." P. 5. And in his &s;ermon from Rom. viii. 29, 30, he &s;ays, "Good looking on all ages from the creation to the con&s;ummation as a moment, and &s;eeing at once whatever is in the hearts of all the children of men, knows every one that does or does not believe in every age or nation. Yet what he knows, whether faith or unbelief, is in no wife cau&s;ed by his knowledge. Men are as <HI>free</HI> in be|lieving or not believing, as if he did not know it at all." P. 6.</P>
<P>I readily grant that his knowledge does not cau&s;e any &s;in, which is altogether of the creature. The angels who fell, <HI>kept not their fir&s;t e&s;tate, but left their own habitation.</HI> Jude 6. And tho&s;e who &s;tood were <HI>elect angels.</HI> 1 Tim. v. 21. And &s;in came into human nature by violating a known command; and Adam was a <HI>figure</HI> of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and therefore death reigned over all his po&s;terity, many of whom never committed any actual tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion, as he did. And the word <HI>as,</HI> &s;o often u&s;ed in this affair, cannot be true in any &s;en&s;e, if both Adam and Chri&s;t were not heads and repre|&s;entatives of all the &s;eed of each. It is certain that
<PB N="11" REF="021663_0011_0FB500E5C724EB20">Adam was not a figure of Chri&s;t, as he conveyed death and ruin to his po&s;terity by a <HI>ju&s;t &s;entence of law;</HI> for Chri&s;t conveys life and &s;alvation to &s;ouls by a free <HI>gift of grace.</HI> Neither could Adam be a figure of Chri&s;t, in the great things that he did by <HI>one offence;</HI> for Chri&s;t atoned for <HI>many offences;</HI> therefore <HI>where &s;in abounded, grace did much more abound.</HI> Rom. v. 12.&mdash;21. Even to the <HI>re&s;ur|rection of the dead.</HI> 1 Cor. xv. 21, 22. I &s;ay the word <HI>as</HI> cannot be true in the&s;e places, unle&s;s tho&s;e two men acted for all their &s;eed. Many would have it, that this word cannot be true unle&s;s Chri&s;t atoned for as many as fell in Adam; but certain death came upon all Adam's race, while multitudes hold that &s;alvation by Chri&s;t is <HI>uncer|tain,</HI> and depends upon the wills of individuals. In this view they would make Chri&s;t va&s;tly infe|rior to Adam, who&s;e doings were efficacious, and the doings of Chri&s;t exceeding precarious, upon their plan. And they who hold that Chri&s;t will finally &s;ave all the race of Adam from hell, yet imagine that the creature's &s;ufferings mu&s;t &s;ave them, and not the efficacy of the death and grace of Chri&s;t. Or if they hold that he will &s;ave all from future &s;ufferings, they hold al&s;o that he hath now &s;aved them from the authority of the law of God, which Adam never did. By the &s;entence of it, every child of Adam returns to the du&s;t, the righteous as well as the wicked; &s;o that if the do|ings of Chri&s;t are not efficacious for the final &s;al|vation of his &s;eed, it cannot truly be &s;aid that <HI>as</HI> in Adam all die, <HI>even &s;o</HI> in Chri&s;t &s;hall all be made alive. Adam was <HI>made upright;</HI> but Solomon could not tell how many <HI>inventions</HI> his children would &s;eek out. Eccle. vii. 29. A darling one
<PB N="12" REF="021663_0012_0FB500F35BF8B4A0">in our day is, that a man cannot be worthy of re|ward or puni&s;hment, unle&s;s he hath power in his will to become righteous when he plea&s;eth. And if &s;o, then faith would be of him&s;elf, and not the <HI>gift of God,</HI> directly again&s;t the truth of his word. Eph. ii. 8. Boa&s;ting could not be excluded in &s;uch a ca&s;e, as it is by the <HI>law of faith.</HI> Rom. iii. 27. So that this controver&s;y is not with poor worms, but with the eternal God. His <HI>will</HI> was as really exerci&s;ed in rai&s;ing up Pharaoh and others, and &s;uffering them to go far in their rebellion, and in oppre&s;&s;ing the &s;aints; as it was in finally de&s;troy|ing the former and &s;aving the latter. But the ob|jection again&s;t this doctrine, was and is, <HI>Why doth he yet find fault? for who hath ever re&s;i&s;ted his will?</HI> This was the language of tho&s;e who followed after the law of righteou&s;ne&s;s, but did not attain to it, becau&s;e they &s;ought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. Rom. ix. 16&mdash;32. Yea, and tho&s;e who do &s;o are exceeding <HI>partial</HI> in the law.</P>
<P>Mr. We&s;ley, in his book called, <HI>Prede&s;tination calmly con&s;idered,</HI> &s;ays, "I believe election to be conditional, as well as the reprobation oppo&s;ite thereto. I believe the eternal decree concerning both, is expre&s;&s;ed in tho&s;e words, <HI>He that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved: he that believeth not, &s;hall be damned.</HI> And this decree without doubt God will not change, and man cannot re&s;i&s;t." P. 10. But where did he make any &s;uch decree? In the go&s;|pel commi&s;&s;ion, he &s;ays, <HI>He that believeth and is bapti&s;ed &s;hall be &s;aved.</HI> Mark xvi. 16. But men have pre&s;umed to alter that decree, ever &s;ince the third century; before which no man hath proved that infant bapti&s;m was ever named in the world.
<PB N="13" REF="021663_0013_0FB500F4C4E017B8">By bapti&s;m believers <HI>put on Chri&s;t.</HI> Gal. iii. 27. Which no one can do for another, any more than one can be &s;aved or damned for another in eternity. Chri&s;t is the only lawgiver to his church, and when Kings &s;hall become nur&s;ing fathers to her, they will <HI>bow down</HI> to his authority therein. I&s;aiah xlix. 23. And how great is the difference betwixt a nur&s;e and a whorema&s;ter. The good tidings to Zion is, <HI>Thy God reigneth.</HI> And <HI>with the heart man believeth unto righteou&s;ne&s;s, and with the mouth con|fe&s;&s;ion is made unto &s;alvation.</HI> I&s;aiah III. 7. Rom. x. 10, 15. And none will be owned by him in the la&s;t day, who are now a&s;hamed to confe&s;s him before men. Mat. x. 32, 33. And if God look|ed on all ages as a moment, how could he elect per|&s;ons, and then reject them again in that moment? Yet We&s;ley &s;ays, "One who is a true believer, or, in other words, one who is holy or righteous in the judgment of God him&s;elf, may neverthele&s;s finally fall from grace." P. 49.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t argument to prove this a&s;&s;ertion is taken from God's &s;aying, When the righteous turneth away from his righteou&s;ne&s;s, and committeth ini|quity, in his tre&s;pa&s;s that he hath tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed, and in his &s;in that he hath &s;inned, in them &s;hall he die. Ezek. xviii. 24. From whence We&s;ley &s;ays, "One who is righteous in the judgment of God him&s;elf, may finally fall from grace." P. 51. An&s;wer, God never promi&s;ed to &s;upport any one in an unrighteous way; neither will he de&s;troy any true penitent, for his own &s;ins, or for the iniquity of his fathers; and if God cannot &s;peak of the&s;e things in a conditional way, without having the final event uncertain in his own infinite mind un|til the creature decides it, then this argument may
<PB N="14" REF="021663_0014_0FB500F64DE962D8">&s;tand, and not el&s;e. And if the creature could di&s;appoint the Creator, then we &s;hould fear man more than God. A horrible evil! A &s;econd ar|gument is drawn from 1 Tim. i. 18, 19, from whence it is &s;aid, "Ob&s;erve,

<ITEM>1. The&s;e men had once the faith that produceth a <HI>good con&s;cience,</HI> which they had, or they could not have <HI>put it away.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. They <HI>made &s;hipwreck</HI> of the faith, which nece&s;&s;arily implies the total and final lo&s;s of it."</ITEM>
</LIST>
P. 51. But in the &s;ame chapter it is &s;aid, The end of the commandment is charity, out of a pure heart, and of a good con&s;cience, and of faith unfeigned; from which &s;ome having &s;werved, have turned a&s;ide unto vain jangling; de&s;iring to be teachers of the law, under&s;tanding neither what they &s;ay, nor whereof they affirm. And if men cannot be greatly enlightened and reformed by the Spirit of truth, and yet afterwards &s;werve from it and put it away, without ever being born again, then this argument may &s;tand, and not otherwi&s;e. His third argument is framed from Rom. xi. 17, &amp;c. Upon which he &s;ays, "Tho&s;e who are grafted into the &s;piritual, invi&s;ible church, may neverthele&s;s finally fail." P. 53. To which I reply, That the unbelieving Jews failed from the vi&s;ible church, and &s;aving faith was nece&s;&s;ary to graft the Gentiles into it, who ought not to be high-minded, but fear, as is very evident from this pa&s;&s;age; and God &s;ays, I will put my fear in their hearts, that they &s;hall not depart from me. Jer. xxxii 40. And who will dare to contradict him! Mr. We&s;|ley takes his fourth argument from John xv. 1&mdash;6, from whence he infers, "That true believers, who are branches of the true vine, may neverthele&s;s fi|nally fall." P. 55. But as Chri&s;t is the only head
<PB N="15" REF="021663_0015_0FB500F7B67CDE28">of the true church, many may be vi&s;ible branches in him, and yet be ca&s;t into the fire for their un|fruitfulne&s;s, while living branches are purged and made more fruitful. And to &s;uch Chri&s;t &s;aid in the &s;ame chapter, Ye have not <HI>cho&s;en</HI> me, but I have <HI>cho&s;en</HI> you, and ordained you, that you &s;hould go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit &s;hould remain. Afterwards he &s;aid to the Father, <HI>Of them which thou gave&s;t me have I lo&s;t none.</HI> John xviii. 9. Yet, fifthly, Mr. We&s;ley brings 2 Peter ii. 20, 21, to prove that "Tho&s;e who by the inward know|ledge of Chri&s;t, have e&s;caped the pollutions of the world, may yet fall back into tho&s;e pollutions and peri&s;h everla&s;tingly." P. 56. But all ought to know, that the dog who returns to his vomit again, and the &s;ow that was wa&s;hed to her wallowing in the mire, never had their natures changed, though their behaviour was &s;o for a while. Therefore we are warned again&s;t giving the holy things of the church to dogs, &s;wine or wolves, as far as we can di&s;cover them by their fruits. Mat. vii. 6, 15. His &s;ixth argument is taken from Heb. vi. 4&mdash;8. p. 56. But we may &s;ee that the per&s;ons here &s;poken of, are like ground which beareth <HI>thorns and briars,</HI> and are entirely di&s;tinct from &s;ouls who receive the &s;eed into <HI>good</HI> ground. Mat. xiii. 23. Our author takes his &s;eventh argument from Heb. x. 38, which he &s;ays, if rightly tran&s;lated, is, "If the ju&s;t man that lives by faith draws back, my &s;oul &s;hall have no plea&s;ure in him." P. 58. But we ought to know, that living by faith, and drawing back, are too oppo&s;ite things; and the fir&s;t is here urged as an effectual guard again&s;t the la&s;t. Eighth|ly, our opponant brings Heb. x. 26&mdash;29, to prove "That tho&s;e who are &s;anctified by the blood of
<PB N="16" REF="021663_0016_0FB500FE75D1D8E8">the covenant, may yet peri&s;h everla&s;tingly." P. 62. But though per&s;ons who &s;in <HI>wilfully</HI> again&s;t the laws, blood and Spirit of Chri&s;t, will have a much &s;orer puni&s;hment than they who died without mer|cy under the law of Mo&s;es, yet this cannot prove that any &s;uch per&s;on was ever truly regenerated. However, after quoting many more &s;cripture warn|ings again&s;t di&s;obedience and apo&s;tacy, Mr. We&s;|ley lets us know, that he would not have us con|&s;ider this doctrine by it&s;elf, "but as it &s;tands in connection with unconditional reprobation, that mill-&s;tone which hangs about the neck of your whole hypothe&s;is." P. 65.</P>
<P>From whence we may &s;ee, that the plain lan|guage of revelation is of no avail with him again&s;t his horrid ideas of reprobation. When any try to put that terrible word out of their minds, he &s;ays, "To think about a <HI>certain number</HI> of &s;ouls, whom <HI>alone</HI> God hath decreed to &s;ave, in that very thought reprobation lurks: it entered your heart the mo|ment that entered: it &s;tays as long as that &s;tays; and you cannot &s;peak that thought, without &s;peak|ing reprobation. True, it is covered with fig-leaves, &s;o that a heedle&s;s eye may not ob&s;erve it to be there. But if you narrowly ob&s;erve, uncondi|tional election cannot appear, without the cloven foot of reprobation." P. 9. An&s;wer, We well know that the doctrine of particular election, im|plies, that the re&s;t of mankind are left to peri&s;h in their &s;ins, as God might ju&s;tly have dealt with us all. But this idea is rejected by Mr. We&s;ley. And when it was &s;aid, "You know in your own con&s;ci|ence, God might ju&s;tly have pa&s;t by you," he &s;aid, "I deny it. That God might <HI>ju&s;tly,</HI> for my un|faithfulne&s;s to his grace, have <HI>given me up</HI> long <HI>ago,</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="021663_0017_0FB500FF9F4CAA30">I grant: but this conce&s;&s;ion &s;uppo&s;es me to have had that grace, which you &s;ay a reprobate never had." P. 18. An&s;wer, We are far from believ|ing that all the <HI>natural</HI> liberty of men is by grace, as he hath a&s;&s;erted; for God &s;ays, In the la&s;t days perilous times &s;hall come; for men &s;hall be lovers of their own&s;elves, covetous, boa&s;ters, proud, bla&s;|phemers, di&s;obedient to parents, unthankful, unho|ly, without natural affection, truce-breakers, fal&s;e accu&s;ers, incontinent, fierce de&s;pi&s;ers of tho&s;e that are good, traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of plea&s;ures more than lovers of God; having a form of godline&s;s, but denying the power thereof: from &s;uch turn away.&mdash;The&s;e re&s;i&s;t the truth; <HI>reprobate</HI> concerning the faith. 2 Tim. iii. 1&mdash;8. This is a mo&s;t exact de&s;cription of the reprobates of our day. But I am far from thinking that grace gave them a power to love them&s;elves above God and their neighbours, and to run into all this wicked|ne&s;s under a form of godline&s;s, while they deny the power thereof. Yea, do not all tho&s;e deny the power of it, who deny particular election and final per&s;everance? Mr. We&s;ley &s;ays, "I have heard, that God the Father made a covenant with his Son, before the world began, wherein the Son agreed to &s;uffer &s;uch and &s;uch things, and the Father to give him &s;uch and &s;uch &s;ouls for a recompen&s;e: that in con&s;equence of this, tho&s;e &s;ouls <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be &s;av|ed, and tho&s;e only, &s;o that all others <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be damn|ed." This idea of the covenant he rejects, and &s;ays, "The tenor of it is this; Who&s;oever believeth unto the end, &s;o as to &s;hew his faith by his works, I the Lord will reward that &s;oul eternally: but who&s;oever will not believe, and con&s;equently dieth in his &s;ins, I will puni&s;h him with everla&s;ting de|&s;truction."
<PB N="18" REF="021663_0018_0FB50102627D3D28">P. 44, 45. And what difference is there between this and &s;aying, <HI>The man that doth them &s;hall live in them?</HI> They who turn the go&s;pel into this &s;en&s;e, are <HI>bewitched.</HI> Gal. iii. 1, 12. As to the covenant, Je&s;us &s;aid, <HI>I lay down my life for the &s;heep.&mdash;Ye believe not, becau&s;e ye are not of my &s;heep, as I &s;aid unto you.

My Father who gave them me, is greater than all, and none is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand. Je&s;us lift up his eyes to heaven, and &s;aid, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son al&s;o may glorify thee. As thou ha&s;t given him power over all fle&s;h, that he &s;hould give eternal life to as many as thou ha&s;t given him.</HI> John x. 15, 26&mdash;29. xvii. 1, 2. If particular election, and final per&s;everance, are not contained in the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, I know not what can be intended therein. And as Mr. We&s;ley and his followers are &s;o vehement again&s;t that doc|trine, and tell of &s;hewing their faith by their works, it is needful to examine &s;ome of their works con|cerning America.</P>
<P>In November 1763, Mr. We&s;ley &s;aid in his <HI>Journal,</HI> "Many have been convinced of &s;in, many ju&s;tified, and many back&s;liders healed. But the peculiar work of this &s;ea&s;on has been, what St. Paul calls <HI>The perfecting of the &s;aints.</HI> Many per|&s;ons in London, in Bri&s;tol, in York, and in vari|ous parts both of England and Ireland, have ex|perienced &s;o deep and univer&s;al a change, as it had not before entered into their hearts to receive. After a deep conviction of inbred &s;in, of their total fall from God, they have been &s;o filled with faith
<PB N="19" REF="021663_0019_0FB50103C9F1B338">and love (and generally in a moment) that &s;in va|ni&s;hed, and they found from that time no pride, anger, de&s;ire or unbelief. They could rejoice ever|more, pray without cea&s;ing, and in every thing give thanks. Now whether we call this the <HI>de&s;truc|tion</HI> or <HI>&s;u&s;pen&s;ion</HI> of &s;in, it is a glorious work of God: &s;uch work, as con&s;idering both the depth and extent of it, we never &s;aw in the&s;e kingdoms before. It is po&s;&s;ible, &s;ome who &s;poke in this manner, were mi&s;taken, and it is certain, &s;ome have lo&s;t what they then received." That many of them were mi&s;taken, can ea&s;ily be believed; much ea&s;ier than to believe that any of them were per|fect, and then fell from it. For as long as their controver&s;y in Britain, about taxing America, was carried on by words, Mr. We&s;ley openly appeared in our favour; but when they came to blows, he &s;hifted &s;ides, and exerted all his exten&s;ive influence in that <HI>bloody cau&s;e;</HI> and &s;o did Mr. John Fletcher, an author much e&s;teemed by that &s;ect. Mr. We&s;|ley was in the city of Bri&s;tol in September 1774, and highly recommended to his friends a pamphlet wrote by M. P. entitled, <HI>An argument in defence of the exclu&s;ive right claimed by the colonies to tax them|&s;elves.</HI> But when the &s;word was drawn the next year, Mr. We&s;ley took out the &s;ub&s;tance of a piece wrote by Dr. J. entitled, <HI>Taxation no tyranny,</HI> and added &s;ome warm reflections of his own, and pub|li&s;hed the whole as his own, to inflame all his fol|lowers again&s;t us. Therefore a Bapti&s;t mini&s;ter in Bri&s;tol, publi&s;hed a brief an&s;wer to him, with a men|tion of the&s;e facts, under the name of Americanus. Hereupon We&s;ley reprinted his pamphlet, with a preface, in which he &s;aid, "The book which this writer &s;ays I &s;o &s;trongly recommended, <HI>I never yet

<P>But did he let go per&s;onal reflections? Mr. Evans's reply is before me, wherein he &s;ays, "Your in&s;inuating that I have taken more from Mr. P. that you have from Dr. J. is an artifice to cover
<PB N="21" REF="021663_0021_0FB5010849BA8E08">your own plagiari&s;m, too thin not to be &s;een through by the mo&s;t &s;uperficial. It is not <HI>fact.</HI> I have not taken a line from that or any other author without acknowledging it. But when you pub|li&s;hed your addre&s;s, you gave not even a hint of having taken any part of it from Dr. J. or any other writer." Thus did Mr. We&s;ley exert all his influence, to a&s;&s;i&s;t Great-Britain in her at|tempts to bind us in all ca&s;es whatever. And had they &s;ucceeded therein, we &s;hould have been in as bad a ca&s;e, as he &s;ays Adam was before a Saviour was revealed to him. Yea, as much wor&s;e as fall|ing into the hands of unmerciful men, is wor&s;e than being in the hands of a merciful God. And the&s;e men are &s;till pur&s;uing us, with attempts to rob us of our only hope in Chri&s;t, and al&s;o of the liberty wherewith he hath made us free. For in 1784, M. We&s;ley and his followers publi&s;hed a book in England, which they call, <HI>The Sunday &s;ervice in North-America.</HI> Three orders of mini&s;ters are pre|&s;cribed therein, who are to have the whole power of receiving and excluding church members, with|out calling any vote of the brethren; and when the lowe&s;t order of tho&s;e mini&s;ters is to be ordained, they &s;ay to him, "Will you reverently obey them to whom the charge and government over you is committed, following with a glad mind and will their godly admonitions? An&s;wer, I will endeavour &s;o to do, the Lord being my helper." P. 283. Soon after which they publi&s;hed a pamphlet, entitled, "A form of di&s;cipline, for the mini&s;ters, preachers, and members of the Methodi&s;t epi&s;copal church in America; con&s;idered and approved at a conference held at Baltimore, in the State of Maryland, on Monday the 27th of December, 1784; in which

About twenty years ago, Philip Embary, a local preacher from Ireland, began to preach in the city of New-York, and formed a &s;ociety of his own countrymen and the citizens. About the &s;ame time, Robert Strawbridge, a local preacher from Ireland, &s;ettled in Frederick county, in the &s;tate of Maryland, and preaching there, formed &s;ome &s;ocieties. In 1769, Richard Boardman and Jo&s;eph Pilman, came to New-York, who were the fir&s;t regular Methodi&s;t preachers on the continent. In the latter end of the year 1771, Francis A&s;bury and Richard Wright, of the &s;ame order, came over.</ITEM>

After which they &s;ay, "We are all agreed, we may be &s;aved from all &s;in before death." P. 13, 30. Thus a &s;ociety, many of who&s;e laws are contrary to the laws of Chri&s;t, and who&s;e head is in Great-Britain, are &s;preading their influence in America, and have al|ready tried to get &s;ome of their leaders elected in|to the &s;tate Legi&s;lature in Virginia, if not in other States.</P>
<P>The law of Chri&s;t puts all <HI>Elders</HI> in the church upon a level, and &s;ays to the whole community, <HI>All of you be &s;ubject one to another, and be clothed with humility, for God re&s;i&s;teth the proud, and giveth grace unto the humble.</HI> 1 Peter v. 1&mdash;5. And when Chri&s;t came a light into the world, the only per&s;ons that believed on him, <HI>were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the fle&s;h, nor of the will of man, but of God. Except a man be born again he cannot &s;ee the kingdom of God.</HI> John i. 12, 13. iii. 3. But ever &s;ince the ri&s;e of the man of &s;in, teachers have claimed a power of office above the church, which none could convey to others but officers; and al&s;o a power in their wills to bring children into the kingdom of God, without their own knowledge or choice. And to this day men are exceeding tenacious of this arbitrary power. The followers of Mr. We&s;ley &s;ay, in their form of di&s;cipline, "Que&s;t. 1. How is a bi&s;hop con&s;tituted?

An|&s;wer, Let the conference immediately elect a bi&s;hop, and let the elders, or any three of them, con&s;ecrate him to his office." The Pre&s;byterians hold bi&s;hops and elders to be equal, but both above the church, and in this way many hold their &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of of|fice from the old bi&s;hops in England. The pre|&s;ident of their univer&s;ity in Connecticut, in a &s;er|mon before the Legi&s;lature of that State, &s;aid of the fir&s;t mini&s;ters in New-England, "The induc|tion of the mini&s;ters of the fir&s;t churches, was per|formed by lay-brethren, and this was called ordi|nation, but &s;hould be con&s;idered what in reality it was, only induction or in&s;talment of tho&s;e who were ve&s;ted with official power.

<P>Indeed it may ju&s;tly be matter of thankful won|der to all, con&s;idering the errors of learned mini|&s;ters on every hand. For if our civil rulers &s;hould now declare, that they derived their office power from Great-Britain, and that the people of America had only inducted them into their offices to which they had a prior right, what a confu&s;ion &s;hould we &s;oon be in! But this is not the wor&s;t of our ca&s;e; for all who have renounced the only living and true God, are pagans, and the covenant of circum|ci&s;ion, on which infant bapti&s;m is built, required I&s;rael to de&s;troy all the pagans in Canaan, and to &s;eize upon their e&s;tates. And from the bloody imagination, that Chri&s;tians had a right to do the like, came the late war. The church of Rome acted upon this bloody imagination, un|til England revolted from her in 1533, and &s;et up their king as the head of their church. The inhabitants of Mun&s;ter in Germany did the like the &s;ame year. Yet the madne&s;s of Mun&s;ter, becau&s;e it was &s;oon defeated, hath been ca&s;t upon all believers through the world, who refu&s;ed to put bapti&s;m before faith in Chri&s;t. And it is now &s;aid, "In church government the Bapti&s;ts have adopted the <HI>independent</HI> plan; the inconveniency of which they often experience, as it provides no
<PB N="26" REF="021663_0026_0FB501225B892DD8">final and deci&s;ive judge of controver&s;y, nor tribu|nal to pronounce in here&s;y or fal&s;e doctrine. But the di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tic of the bapti&s;t pro|fe&s;&s;ion is their excluding infant, and practi&s;ing only adult bapti&s;m, and making it their great term of communion, excluding all other Chri&s;tians from the Lord's table among them, and not &s;uffering their members to communicate with other church|es. How they can acknowledge any other people to be a church of Chri&s;t, and yet continue this bar of &s;eparation, is not to be accounted for; and we mu&s;t leave them under the weight of this diffi|culty, until them&s;elves are plea&s;ed to remove it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. P. 48, 49.</NOTE></P>
<P>Here all may &s;ee that it is much ea&s;ier to charge others with incon&s;i&s;tency, than to act con&s;i&s;tently our&s;elves. For the&s;e three la&s;t authors profe&s;s the doctrine of particular election and final per&s;e|verance, and yet they blame us, becau&s;e we dare not practically allow, that per&s;ons may be brought into the covenant of grace without their own knowledge or choice, many of whom fall away and peri&s;h forever. They al&s;o condemn the <HI>indepen|dent</HI> plan of government in the church, though they celebrate it in the &s;tate. But there can be no government in the &s;tate if officers therein are not inve&s;ted with power to compel delinquents to &s;ub|mit to their lawful judgments; but the votes of officers in the church, are no more than the votes of the brethren, and the whole community have no more power in this re&s;pect than to exclude unwor|thy members from their communion. And to al|low mini&s;ters a power of office in any church, which that church could not give, and cannot take away,
<PB N="27" REF="021663_0027_0FB501290BD64600">is to make them <HI>lords over God's heritage,</HI> in&s;tead of being examples to the flock. We are &s;o far from denying the vi&s;ible Chri&s;tianity of all who do not &s;ee with us about bapti&s;m, that we view it as a point of va&s;t importance, that none &s;hould be bapti&s;ed but vi&s;ible Chri&s;tians. <HI>If any man have not the Spirit of Chri&s;t, he is none of his.</HI> Without it they are not Chri&s;tians; yet many contend with us becau&s;e we dare not &s;ay the contrary in practice. All who have received that Spirit, ought to be bap|tized in water. Rom. vi. 4. viii. 9. Acts. x. 47, 48. I believe that the di&s;pen&s;ing with the plain laws of Chri&s;t, and the forcibly impo&s;ing the in|ventions of men in his wor&s;hip, is the &s;carlet col|oured bea&s;t which &s;upports the whore of Babylon. It was, and is not, yet is. It will change into all &s;hapes, as circum&s;tances and inclinations carry men. God hath many people in this my&s;terious city; but his voice from heaven is, <HI>Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her &s;ins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</HI> The writings of the <HI>apo&s;tles,</HI> who have explained the <HI>prophets,</HI> and all centre in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is the only <HI>foundation</HI> of his church; and they will triumph over Babylon when &s;he falls. Eph. ii. 19. Rev. xvii. 3, 5, 8. xviii. 4, 20. Early warning was given, again&s;t grievous wolves, and perver&s;e &s;chi&s;matics; to avoid whom God, and the word of his grace is our only &s;ecuri|ty. Acts xx. 29&mdash;32. The <HI>perfection</HI> of the holy &s;criptures is held up as what mu&s;t be continued in, if we would get out of the perils which love to &s;elf, under a form of godline&s;s, hath brought upon the&s;e la&s;t days. 2 Tim. iii. 1&mdash;5, 14&mdash;17. In tho&s;e writings we have no mention of any in&s;tance
<PB N="28" REF="021663_0028_0FB5012AB9FDBBD0">of bapti&s;m without a per&s;onal profe&s;&s;ion of faith and repentance; nor of any one who was admitted into the Chri&s;tian church without water bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>The followers of George Fox, who have formed a large &s;ociety without it, have &s;et up a rule in them&s;elves above the holy &s;criptures. A late writer of theirs, after attempting to excu&s;e George Fox for &s;aying the &s;oul was <HI>infinite,</HI> and trying to prove their opinion of an inward rule from the fir&s;t chapter of the go&s;pel of John, without being able clearly to do it, &s;aid, "Is not the apo&s;tle John's Greek as ordinary as G. Fox's Engli&s;h?"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phipps again&s;t Newton; reprinted at Philadelphia, 1783, P. 191, 203.</NOTE> Thus he would &s;et the leader of their &s;ect on a level with the oracles of God! And it is well known that the majority of them held with Great-Britain in her late bloody attempts again&s;t American liberty; and al&s;o are &s;trongly &s;et again&s;t the doctrine of particular election and final per&s;everance. And can any men be found upon earth, who deny that doctrine, and yet make con&s;cience of obeying the following plain rules of &s;cripture? In Je&s;us Chri&s;t, neither circum|ci&s;ion availeth any thing, nor uncircumci&s;ion, but faith which worketh by love. And they that are Chri&s;t's, have crucified the fle&s;h, with the affections and lu&s;ts. Bear ye one another's burdens, and &s;o fulfil the law of Chri&s;t. Let him that is taught in the word, communicate unto him that teacheth, in all good things. For in Chri&s;t Je&s;us neither circumci&s;ion availeth any thing, nor uncircumci|&s;ion, but a new creature. Gal. v. 6, 23. vi. 2, 6, 15, 16. God calls his covenant with Abraham, The covenant of circumci&s;ion. And Abraham had
<PB N="29" REF="021663_0029_0FB5012C69723EA8">no right to circumci&s;e any &s;tranger, until he had bought him as a &s;ervant with money. Acts vii. 8. Gen. xvii. 13. But the go&s;pel &s;ays to Zion, Ye &s;hall be redeemed without money. Thy God reigneth. I&s;aiah lii. 3, 7. Rom. x. 15. He pur|cha&s;ed the church with his own blood. Acts xx. 28. And after he had done it, he &s;aid, Circumci|&s;ion is nothing, and uncircumci&s;ion is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God. Ye are bought with a price, be not ye the &s;ervants of men. I have written unto you, not to keep com|pany, if any man that is called a brother, be a for|nicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner, with &s;uch an one, no not to eat. 1 Cor. v. 2. vii. 19, 23. Let no man deceive you with vain words; for becau&s;e of the&s;e things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of di&s;obedience. Be not ye therefore partakers with them. Have no fellow&s;hip with the unfruitful works of darkne&s;s, but rather reprove them. Eph. v. 6, 7, 11. Every tree is known by his own fruit; for of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble-bu&s;h gather they grapes. A good man out of the good trea&s;ure of his heart, bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil trea&s;ure of his heart, bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth &s;peaketh. And why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I &s;ay? Luke vi. 43&mdash;46. When the blade &s;prung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares al&s;o.&mdash;Let both grow together until the harve&s;t. The field is the world; the good &s;eed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one. Mat. xiii. 26, 30, 38.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="021663_0030_0FB5013410E98760">
In the&s;e plain &s;criptures, the covenant of circum|ci&s;ion is repealed, by the name which God gave to it; and the church and world are clearly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, as two different judicatories; the one to exclude all who appear by their fruits to be forni|cators, covetous, railers, drunkards, or extortioners, from their fellow&s;hip; the other to let them grow together with the children of the kingdom, in the world, until the end of it, only puni&s;hing &s;uch as work ill to their neighbours. Rom. xiii. 1&mdash;10. And fighting and oaths are allowed of in this latter government. John xviii. 36. Heb. vi. 16. And wars will not fully come to an end, until the na|tions &s;hall freely receive the <HI>law from Zion,</HI> and <HI>guile</HI> &s;hall be bani&s;hed from the church. A loud cry will then be heard, <HI>Babylon is fallen, is fallen.</HI> Mi|cah iv. 1&mdash;10. Rev. xiv. 1&mdash;8. The covenant of circumci&s;ion will no more be called the covenant of grace, nor men be bewitched, as the Galatians were, with the practice of confounding works and grace together. God never injured Cain, in giving &s;aving faith to Abel, nor the Midianites, who were of the &s;eed of Abraham, in electing I&s;rael for his church; neither did he injure Korah, or the child|ren of Reuben, Jacob's fir&s;t born, in electing Aaron and his lawful &s;eed for prie&s;ts: and he never in|jured any man in uniting the prie&s;tly and kingly offices in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and in &s;ouls who are born again, who are the only kings and prie&s;ts in the go&s;pel church. Heb. v. 4&mdash;6. Rev. i. 5, 6. v. 10. And no others have any right to be members there|in; and they all ought ever to be like little child|ren, in&s;tead of &s;triving who &s;hould be the greate&s;t. Mat. xviii. 3, 4. None can have a right in the
<PB N="31" REF="021663_0031_0FB5013AE3FDA750">kingdom of God, who do not receive it as a little child. Mark x. 15. Such are glad of gifts. But Mr. We&s;ley has flatly denied that God could ju&s;tly have pa&s;&s;ed him by, and not have given him pow|er in his will to believe, which is his notion of grace. Wages can be recovered by law, but a gift is be&s;towed on whom, and in what manner the giver plea&s;eth. Therefore God &s;ays, Is it not law|ful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil becau&s;e I am good? So the la&s;t &s;hall be fir&s;t, and the fir&s;t la&s;t; for many are call|ed, but <HI>few cho&s;en.</HI> Mat. xx. 15, 16.</P>
<P>This is the true idea of <HI>election,</HI> which men have an amazing quarrel again&s;t. For if it depends en|tirely upon the <HI>will</HI> of God, whether he will &s;ave any of us, or not, then we can have no encourage|ment to &s;et up our <HI>wills</HI> again&s;t him. If we do &s;o, he can bla&s;t all our &s;chemes as he plea&s;eth; and when we come to die, he may then chu&s;e whe|ther he will hear our cries for mercy or not. Yea, he hath a&s;&s;ured us that he will not hear our cries then, if we now <HI>delight in &s;corning, and hate know|ledge.</HI> Prov. i. 20&mdash;29. Giving diligence in the believing pur&s;uit of virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godline&s;s, brotherly kindne&s;s and charity, is the only way to make our <HI>calling and election &s;ure;</HI> while heretics are <HI>&s;elf-willed,</HI> under the name of <HI>liberty.</HI> 2 Peter i. 5&mdash;11. ii. 1, 10, 19. Our Lord hath &s;et before us an example of <HI>great faith,</HI> which may encourage us in this pur&s;uit. Luke vii. 1&mdash;9. Here ob&s;erve,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That this Roman centurion took all his encouragement from God, as he revealed him&s;elf in his Son, and none of it from any imaginary worthine&s;s in the creature. <HI>I
<PB N="32" REF="021663_0032_0FB5013CBABDE720">am not worthy that thou &s;hould&s;t enter under my roof; wherefore neither thought I my&s;elf worthy to come unto thee.</HI> Yet he believed that Je&s;us, of his own infi|nite mercy, would grant relief.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. He was careful to &s;eek it in a lawful way; and before the death of Chri&s;t, it was <HI>unlawful</HI> for a member of that church to keep company with other nations. Acts x. 28. Therefore he would not violate the law of God, even to &s;ave life.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. He believed that Je&s;us could do it when ab&s;ent, as well as if he was pre|&s;ent. <HI>Say in a word, and my &s;ervant &s;hall be healed.</HI> Herein his faith was much greater than the faith of Martha, Mary, or of Thomas the apo&s;tle. John xi. 21, 32. xx. 29. He clearly acted by faith, and not by &s;ight.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. He made good u&s;e of his rea&s;on to &s;trengthen his faith, and not to weaken or de|&s;troy it, as is the ca&s;e with multitudes.</ITEM>
</LIST>
He &s;aid, <HI>I al&s;o am a man &s;et under authority, having under me &s;oldiers; and I &s;ay unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my &s;ervant, Do this, and he doth it.</HI> And if an unworthy &s;inner, with a commi&s;&s;ion from a heathen power, could be thus obeyed, what can be too hard for the Captain of our &s;alvation!</P>
<P>He took not on him the nature of angels, but the &s;eed of Abraham, that through death he might de&s;troy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil, and deliver them who through fear of death were all their life-time &s;ubject to bondage. Every di&s;covery of &s;in and want &s;hould &s;peed our flight to the throne of his grace, that we may ob|tain mercy and find grace to help in time of need. For he is able to &s;ave them to the uttermo&s;t, that come unto God by him, &s;eeing he ever liveth to
<PB N="33" REF="021663_0033_0FB5013E373D0590">make interce&s;&s;ion for them. Heb. ii. 14&mdash;18. iv. 16. vii. 25. His only temple here below is in them who are <HI>poor, and of a contrite &s;pirit, and tremble at his word.</HI> And if their brethren pretend a regard to the glory of God, in hating of them, and ca&s;ting them out, yet he &s;ays, I &s;hall appear to your joy, and they &s;hall be a&s;hamed. I&s;aiah lxvi. 1&mdash;5. The fir&s;t Chri&s;tian martyr &s;ealed this te&s;timony with his blood. Acts vii. 48&mdash;51. And others overcame the great <HI>accu&s;er,</HI> by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their te&s;timony, and they loved not their lives unto the death. And when their <HI>&s;ouls</HI> &s;hall be rai&s;ed, the devil will be bound, and be ca&s;t into the bottomle&s;s pit, out of which the bea&s;t came who kills the two witne&s;&s;es. Rev. xi. 7. xii. 11. xx. 1&mdash;4. The word of God, both by Mo&s;es and the Lamb, is as clear as <HI>gla&s;s,</HI> and as powerful as <HI>fire;</HI> and they who obtain the victory over the bea&s;t, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, &s;tand and act joyfully upon the &s;ea of gla&s;s, mingled with fire. 2 Cor. iii. 18. Jer. xxiii. 29. Rev. xv. 2, 3. Covetou&s;ne&s;s is idolatry. Col. iii. 5. And to de&s;troy idolatry Elijah &s;aid, How long halt ye be|tween two opinions? if the Lord be God, follow him; and if Baal, then follow him; which point was decided by <HI>fire from heaven.</HI> 1 Kings xviii. 21, 39. And way for the fir&s;t coming of our Lord was prepared by a man who came in the <HI>Spirit and power of Elijah.</HI> Mal. iv. 1, 2, 5. Luke i. 17. And way for his &s;econd coming will be prepared, by the rai&s;ing of the <HI>&s;ouls</HI> of the old martyrs; which I think means the re&s;urrection of their <HI>Spirit and power in the churches.</HI> For God gave them not
<PB N="34" REF="021663_0034_0FB5014855024008">the &s;pirit of fear, but of power, of love, and of a a &s;ound mind. 2 Tim. i. 7. Even &s;uch love as to &s;acrifice their lives, before they would violate any rule of truth or equity.</P>
<P>All the world have now &s;een, that love is a va&s;tly more powerful principle of action than fear. For as long as the Americans were afraid of de&s;truction or &s;lavery, their union and activity defeated all the attempts of their enemies; but no &s;ooner was that fear removed, than the love of riches, hon|ors and plea&s;ures, prevailed over contracts and oaths, and filled the land with di&s;cord, treachery and infidelity. By the love of money, va&s;t num|bers have erred from the truth, and pierced them|&s;elves through with many &s;orrows. And our only remedy is, Not to tru&s;t in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy. That we do good, that we be rich in good works, ready to di&s;tribute, willing to communicate; laying up in &s;tore a good foundation again&s;t the time to come, that we may lay hold on eternal life. 1 Tim. vi. 9&mdash;19.</P>
