<P>THE following Sheets were plan'd at the &s;ame Time with the Pam|phlet on the Situation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of our intended College, publi&s;h'd la&s;t <HI>October;</HI> and de&s;ign'd to follow it whenever the Public, by a more ge|neral Attention to the Concerns of Education, &s;hou'd &s;eem prepar'd to receive it. For, however nece&s;&s;ary and &s;ea&s;onable an Enquiry, concerning the proper Situation and Advantages of a College in this Province, was in it&s;elf, as a fir&s;t Step, to &s;ettle a Point that had been long di&s;puted, and to unite all Parties in a &s;peedy Execution; yet I was always convinced, that this is but the lea&s;t Part of what ought to be &s;ettled previous to our propos'd E&s;tabli&s;hment, and Nothing more than a mere Trifle in Compari&s;on of the Con&s;titution, Government, and Di&s;cipline of a College; with which indeed Nothing can be compared; and concerning which no Per&s;on, I be|lieve, has more frequently employ'd his Thoughts than I have done. This will fully appear to tho&s;e who can form a ju&s;t Idea of the Study and Labor it mu&s;t have co&s;t to bring all the Parts of the following Work into their pre&s;ent Order in &s;uch a &s;mall Compa&s;s: A Labor, nothing cou'd have induc'd me, at pre&s;ent, to undergo, but an unfeign'd Zeal for the Advance|ment of u&s;eful Literature in this uncultivated Corner of the Globe, and a fond De&s;ire to make &s;ome Amends to the Public, on the <HI>main Subject,</HI> for their kind and unmerited Reception of the former E&s;&s;ay.</P>
<P>This Work is addre&s;s'd more immediately to the Con&s;ideration of the Tru&s;tees, tho' I am &s;en&s;ible that, by the De&s;ign of their Nomination, they are not empower'd to give any ab&s;olute Deci&s;ion on the Expediency of Propo&s;als of this Nature. However, as they are the only &s;tanding Body, upon whom this great Work re&s;ts, &s;o far as it is yet advanc'd, it was proper to &s;end the&s;e Papers abroad under their Protection. The Manu&s;cript wou'd have been pre&s;ented to them at their fir&s;t public Meeting, had I not been advis'd by &s;ome of them, to whom I &s;hew'd it, as private Friends, that &s;uch a Scheme cou'd be be&s;t judg'd of in Print; when every Per&s;on might have the calm Peru&s;al of a Copy; and that the &s;ooner it appear'd, of the greater Service might it become.&mdash;As it was written with this very Intention, to give Men of Sen&s;e and Learning an Opportunity of blaming, altering, or improving it, before the Meeting of the General A&s;&s;embly, I immediately committed it to the Pre&s;s, without con&s;ulting Reputation, by advi&s;ing, as u&s;ual, with &s;ome of my very conde&s;cending and learn'd City Friends, by which Means it might have appear'd to greater Advantage. &mdash;But as I have &s;till a better Aim than any Reputation to be gain'd by the be&s;t executed Thing of this Nature, I &s;hall not even envy my very Enemies the Plea&s;ure they may find in detecting &s;ome Imperfections which, on more Thought, I cou'd have remov'd; or others which, perhaps, I never intended to remove: Let them only &s;hew they can do &s;o with good Manners; then every Error they di&s;cover, or Improvement they propo&s;e, on the fol|lowing Scheme, will be of &s;ome Service to the Public, and Matter of great Joy to the Author.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO every One that has the Intere&s;t and Reputation of this Province at Heart, particularly to You, it mu&s;t give a very &s;en&s;ible Satisfaction to behold, at length, the general At|tention drawn towards the E&s;tabli&s;hing a public <HI>Seminary</HI> in it, under the Patronage of the Government, for the In&s;titution of Youth in the liberal <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Sciences.</HI> The Spirit now &s;eems to burn &s;o much the &s;tronger in Proportion to its Slowne&s;s in Catching; and gives &s;ure Pre&s;age that we &s;hall not only re|trieve our Honor, by rivaling the foremo&s;t of our Neighbors in this truly pious Work, but as far out-do them as they
<PB N="8" REF="007121_0007_102AF94589FD9248">have got the Start of Us, and as our &s;uperior Abilities have put it in our Power.</P>
<P>The Day, on which it is expected the <HI>General A&s;&s;embly</HI> will meet, draws near; when, in Con&s;equence of a V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of la&s;t Se&s;&s;ions, this important Affair will be the Subject of their De|liberations. And, as the Plan or Idea of the whole In&s;titution ought, fir&s;t of all, to be fix'd, that every Step they take may tend uniformly to the Execution of the &s;ame, it is the indi&s;pen|&s;able Duty of every Per&s;on of Learning and Lei&s;ure, to a&s;&s;i&s;t with his unbya&s;s'd Thoughts on this Head. I, therefore, thought it incumbent on me to contribute my Mite for this good Pur|po&s;e, as well to exonerate my&s;elf of what I owe the State, as to &s;atisfy the Expectations of &s;ome Gentlemen who have a Right at all Times to command me.</P>
<P>While I was ruminating upon the Con&s;titutions of the &s;everal Colleges, I had either per&s;onally vi&s;ited or read of, without be|ing able to fix on any Thing, I dur&s;t recommend as a Model worthy our Imitation, I chanc'd to fall into the Company of a valuable young Gentleman, named <HI>Evander,</HI> who is a Per|&s;on of &s;ome Di&s;tinction of the Province of <HI>Mirania,</HI> After &s;ome Conver&s;ation on learn'd Topics, he was led to give me an Account of a Seminary e&s;tabli&s;h'd about twelve Years ago in that Province, in which I thought I perceiv'd all that &s;eems excellent in the ancient and modern <HI>In&s;titutions</HI> reduc'd to the greate&s;t Method and Simplicity. This I have pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m'd to pro|po&s;e to your Con&s;ideration; which, as it may be further improv'd by you, and other learn'd Men among us, &s;eems extremely well adapted to the Circum&s;tances of this Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> as we are now entirely &s;uch as the <HI>Miranians</HI> were when they founded their College, with Regard to Riches, Trade and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he Number of People.</P>
<P><HI>Mirania,</HI> Gentlemen, is one of the Provinces of the <HI>New-World</HI> fir&s;t &s;ettled by our Country-Men, the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> above a Century ago. In what Degrees of Lat. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it lies, is of no Importance; I am not to write its Hi&s;tory, but only to give a general Account of its College and the Method of Education practis'd in it; which, as nearly as I can remember, I &s;hall do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ander</HI>'s own Words, as I am &s;en&s;ible that every Deviation from them would be a Blemi&s;h.&mdash;After a mode&s;t Apology, with which I &s;hall not trouble You, he began as follows,&mdash;</P>

<P>"_IT had been the peculiar Happine&s;s of my Countrymen, ever &s;ince their fir&s;t Settlement, to enjoy an uninterrupted Tranquillity; at Peace with their Neighbours, unrival'd in their Trade, and ble&s;t in one Admini&s;tration of a Succe&s;&s;ion of mild and ju&s;t Governors, who had the real Intere&s;t of the Province at Heart. The&s;e favorable Circum&s;tances had, from time to time, be&s;ides con&s;tant Supplies from the Mother-Country, invited over va&s;t Numbers of Foreigners, who, quitting their native Land, &s;ought a calm Retreat in <HI>Mirania;</HI> where under the Protection of wi&s;e and equal Laws, and far beyond the Reach of Prie&s;tly Domination, and the rapacious Minions of &s;cep|tred Robbers, they might dare to think for them&s;elves, dare to challenge and enjoy the Fruits of their own Indu&s;try.</P>
<P>THUS, about twelve Years ago, the <HI>Miranians</HI> &s;aw them&s;elves a mighty and flori&s;hing People, in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an exten&s;ive Country, capable of producing all the Nece&s;&s;aries, and many of the Superfluities of Life. They reflected that the only Method of making the&s;e natural Advantages of la&s;ting U&s;e to them&s;elves and Po&s;terity,&mdash; the only infallible Source of Tranquillity, Happine&s;s and Glory,&mdash;was to contrive and execute a proper Scheme for forming a Succe&s;&s;ion of &s;ober, virtuous, indu&s;trious Citizens, and checking the Cour&s;e of growing Luxury. They were &s;en&s;ible, that tho' a Combination of lucky Circum&s;tances, almo&s;t wholly independent on them, had rais'd them &s;o high, they &s;hou'd be wanting to them&s;elves if they depended longer on blind Chance for any Thing which was now in their Power to command. They were convinced that, without a previous good Education, the be&s;t Laws are little better than <HI>Verba minantia,</HI> and, con|&s;ider'd as &s;uch, will be dup'd and broke thro' with Im|punity
<PB N="10" REF="007121_0009_102AF94A8753FDE8">by illu&s;trious Villains;&mdash;That the Magi&s;trate can at be&s;t but fright Vice into a Corner, and that 'tis Edu|cation alone can mend and rectify the Heart;&mdash;That no Government can &s;ub&s;i&s;t long on Violence and brute Force; and that Nature follows ea&s;ily when treated rationally, but will not bear to be led, or driven. They &s;aw al&s;o, that among the Foreigners, who were as numerous as the Engli&s;h, many Di&s;tinctions were forming upon their different Cu&s;toms, Languages and Extractions, which, by creating &s;eparate Intere&s;ts, might in the I&s;&s;ue prove fatal to the Government. They wi&s;ely judg'd, therefore, that Nothing cou'd &s;o much contribute to make &s;uch a Mixture of People coale&s;ce and unite in one common Intere&s;t, as the common Education of all the Youth at the &s;ame public Schools under the Eye of the civil Autho|rity. Thus, &s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">y, indi&s;&s;oluble Connexions and Friend&s;hips will be form'd; Prejudices worn off; and the Youth will in Time either forget their very Extrac|tion, or from a more liberal Education, and manly Turn of Thought, learn to contemn tho&s;e little ridiculous Di&s;tinctions that ari&s;e among the Vulgar, becau&s;e their Fathers fir&s;t &s;poke a different Language, or drew Air in a different Clime.</P>
<P>With the&s;e Views the <HI>Miranians</HI> applied them&s;elves to project a Plan of Education; every Per&s;on of Genius, Learning and Experience offering their impartial Thoughts on this Subject, whether they were in a private or public Capacity; as &s;en&s;ible that an Undertaking of &s;uch la&s;ting Con&s;equences demanded the united Councils,&mdash;the Heads and Hearts of a whole country.</P>
<P>The Object they kept always in Sight, was the ea&s;ie&s;t, &s;imple&s;t and mo&s;t natural Method of forming Youth to the Knowlege and Exerci&s;e of private and public Virtue; and therefore they did not &s;cruple to reject &s;ome Things commonly taught at Colleges; to add others; and &s;horten or invert the Order of others, as be&s;t &s;uited their Circum&s;tances. They often had this Sentence in their Mouth, which I think, in other Words, I have read in
<PB N="11" REF="007121_0010_102AF94C778EA030">TILLOTSON,&mdash;That the Knowledge of what tends neither directly nor indirectly to make better Men and better Citizens, is but a Knowlege of Trifles; it is not Learn|ing, but a &s;pecious and ingenious &s;ort of Idlene&s;s.&mdash;We mu&s;t not then, &s;aid they, wilder our&s;elves in the Search of Truth, among the Rubbi&s;h contain'd in the va&s;t Tomes of ancient Rabbies, Commentators and School|men; nor in the more refin'd Speculations of modern Metaphy&s;icians concerning Spirit, Matter, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> nor yet in the polemic Writings about Grace, Prede&s;tination, mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">l Agency, the Trinity, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> which &s;o enflame the World at this Day, to the Di&s;grace of Chri&s;tian Meekne&s;s and Charity. The Years of <HI>Methu&s;alem</HI> would be far too &s;hort to attain any Proficiency in all the Di&s;putes and Re&s;earches of this Kind, which have &s;o long puzzled the learn'd World, and are &s;till as much undecided as at fir&s;t. Almighty God &s;eems to have &s;et the Knowledge of many Things beyond our pre&s;ent Ken, on purpo&s;e to confound our Pride, and whi&s;per to us continually the Degeneracy and Imper|fection of our Nature, and when we con&s;ider &s;uch Things in this Light, we make the only proper U&s;e of them: For, &s;uppo&s;e we could live long enough to become as well vers'd in all the&s;e Points, as the mo&s;t &s;ubtle Doctor that ever breath'd, what would it con|tribute to the main Point, the making better Men and Citizens? Why, ju&s;t nothing at all! We ought then, continued they, rejecting Things &s;uperfluous and hypo|thetical, to mount directly up to fundamental Principles, and endeavour to a&s;certain the Relations we &s;tand in to <HI>GOD and univer&s;al Intelligence,</HI> that we may &s;u&s;tain, with Dignity, the Rank a&s;&s;ign'd us among intellectual Natures, and move in Concert, with the re&s;t of Creation in accompli&s;hing the great End of all Things.</P>
<P>To &s;atisfy our&s;elves of this,&mdash;<HI>Quid &s;umus, et quid|nam victuri gignimur</HI>&mdash;requires no &s;uch Depth of Un|der&s;tanding, no &s;uch &s;ubtle Rea&s;onings and tedious Re&s;earches, as &s;ome would per&s;uade us. For, be&s;ides
<PB N="12" REF="007121_0011_102AF94F01DDF760">his reveal'd Will, God has given Intimations of his Will to us, by appealing to our Sen&s;es in the Con&s;titu|tion of our Nature, and the Con&s;titution and Harmony of the material Univer&s;e. We have only to rea&s;on by Analogy, and cha&s;ti&s;e our Rea&s;onings by the&s;e holy Oracles. Then the lea&s;t Attention will convince us, that what God chiefly expects of us here, is to love Him, and all his Creatures, for his &s;ake;&mdash;to view thro' the Medium of Benevolence and Charity, tho&s;e incon&s;iderable Differences which, in a State of Imper|fection, mu&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;t among free Agents, and which God him&s;elf, perhaps, views with Plea&s;ure;&mdash;to do always the greate&s;t Good in our Power, whether to our|&s;elves or Fellow Creatures, of whatever Country, Sect or Denomination they may be;&mdash;to act a ju&s;t and hone&s;t Part in our &s;ocial Capacity;&mdash;and la&s;tly, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to repair the Ruins of our Nature, by impro|ving and enlarging our Faculties, and confirming our|&s;elves in Habits of Virtue, that thus we may in &s;ome &s;ort, be qualified to be replac'd in our original high Rank, to which, thro' the Redeemer's Merit, we may yet a&s;pire to ri&s;e, and be advanc'd from Stage to Stage of Perfection and Bli&s;s, thro' all the endle&s;s Periods of our Being.&mdash;</P>
<P>To &s;ay, or even think, our pre&s;ent Span is too &s;hort for the&s;e Purpo&s;es, is Pre&s;umption, is &s;hocking Impiety; it is to arraign the Councils of the mo&s;t HIGH, and charge him with Inju&s;tice. We have, in reality, not only Time enough to obey the Dictates of our &s;erious Affections, by learning and di&s;charging the Duties we owe to God and Man, but &s;ufficient left for Recreation, and innocent Amu&s;ement; unle&s;s we will make Life too &s;hort by creating Bu&s;ine&s;s for our&s;elves which no Way concerns us, and turning our Attention to Subjects which, after all our Searches and Re&s;earches, will make us neither wi&s;er nor better than when we fir&s;t &s;et out.</P>
<P>Hence it appears, continued they, of what la&s;ting Importance it is, to accu&s;tom Youth early to di&s;tingui&s;h

Were Men as generally agreed what the&s;e Things are, as they &s;oon would be, cou'd they lay Pa&s;&s;ion and Prejudice wholly a&s;ide, then indeed the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Education wou'd be &s;hort, ea&s;y and plea&s;ant; and the Government of <HI>Mirania</HI> would have found no Difficulty in fixing on a proper and unexcep|tionable Plan for this Purpo&s;e. But they &s;aw with Concern, that while there were Pa&s;&s;ion, Prejudice, Cu&s;tom, Malice, Pride, Ignorance and different Opi|nions in the Province to &s;truggle with, the be&s;t Scheme they could concert would not be alike acceptable to all, and would be liable to many Exceptions and Mi&s;con|&s;tructions.&mdash;No matter: That did not deter them from their Duty. They had the noble Re&s;olution to follow the unbia&s;s'd Dictates of their own Good Sen&s;e, con&s;cious that, tho' they could not project an inexceptionable, far le&s;s a perfect, Plan, they &s;hould acquit them&s;elves to GOD, and the uncorrupted Judgment of Po&s;terity, by rendering it as perfect as they cou'd, and delivering it down in a Condition of being improved as often as Circum&s;tances might alter, and Experience di&s;cover De|fects in it.&mdash;But it would be needle&s;s to trouble you with all the Difficulties and Toils they encountered, be|fore they brought the Scheme to the Point of Perfection aim'd at:&mdash;I &s;hall give an Account of the &s;everal Cla&s;&s;es, and Method of Study, as they are at pre&s;ent: after that I &s;hall give an Account of the Building, and conclude with taking Notice of the chief Steps taken by them in carrying the whole into Execution. This is what is mo&s;t material for your Purpo&s;e. You mu&s;t not, how|ever expect, I can be very particular in this Account: A full Detail of every Thing worth Notice in &s;uch an In&s;titution, would furni&s;h Matter for a Volume; which would be an u&s;eful Book, if done by an able Pen.</P>
<P>With Regard to Learning, the <HI>Miranians</HI> divide the whole Body of People into two grand Cla&s;&s;es. The
<PB N="14" REF="007121_0013_102AF95356E22780">Fir&s;t con&s;i&s;ts of tho&s;e de&s;igned for the learn'd Profe&s;|&s;ions; by which they under&s;tand <HI>Divinity, Law, Phy&s;ic, Agriculture,</HI> and the chief Offices of the State. The Second Cla&s;s of tho&s;e de&s;ign'd for Mechanic Profe&s;&s;ions, and all the remaining People of the Country. Such a Divi&s;ion is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary: For, if the &s;horte&s;t Way of forming Youth to act in their proper Spheres, as good Men and good Citizens ought always to be the Object of Education, the&s;e two Cla&s;&s;es &s;hould be edu|cated on a very different Plan. The Knowlege of the learned Languages, as the Means of acquiring other u&s;e|ful Knowlege, is indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary to the fir&s;t Cla&s;s. To the Second, the Time thus &s;pent is entirely thrown away, as they never have any Occa&s;ion to make u&s;e of tho&s;e Languages. A more general Tincture of the Sciences, except Arithmetic and Mathematics, will al&s;o &s;erve their Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Any Scheme then, that either propo&s;es to teach both the&s;e grand Cla&s;&s;es after the &s;ame Manner, or is wholly calculated for one of them, without regarding the other, mu&s;t be very defective. And yet &s;o it is, that Colleges are almo&s;t unver&s;ally calculated for the Fir&s;t Cla&s;s; while a collegiate School for breeding Mechanics, is rarely to be met with. This Cla&s;s of People, by far the mo&s;t numerous, and al&s;o the Hands and Strength of every Government, are overlook'd, and have No|thing but this wretched Alternative left them; either to glean what Scraps of <HI>Science</HI> they can at private Schools, (often under no Regulations as to Morals or Method) or to go thro' a Cour&s;e of Learning at Colleges, for which they have neither Time nor U&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e Con&s;iderations gave Ri&s;e to what is call'd the <HI>Mechanic's School</HI> in this Seminary. It might, how|ever, as well have been call'd a di&s;tinct College; for it is no Way connected with what is call'd the College, (by Way of Di&s;tinction) than by being under the In&s;pection of the &s;ame Tru&s;tees, and the Government of the &s;ame Head, whom they call <HI>Provo&s;t</HI> or <HI>Principal.</HI> Mo&s;t of

In the Three lowe&s;t, <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> is taught grammatically, and as a Lan|guage, with Writing. In the &s;ix higher Cla&s;&s;es, <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and Writing are continued, at the &s;ame Time that

Thus, at about fifteen Years of Age, the Mechanic's Education is fini&s;h'd; and he comes out well qualified to make a good Figure in every Profe&s;&s;ion wherein Lan|guages are not required.

When this is attain'd, it is a noble Ba&s;is; but wou'd, however, be u&s;ele&s;s without its Super&s;tructure, without teaching them to call forth, and avail them&s;elves of, their Thoughts, in <HI>writing, &s;peaking, acting</HI> and <HI>living well.</HI> To make Youth Ma&s;ters of the fir&s;t two, <HI>viz.</HI> writing and &s;peaking well, which are the Bu&s;ine&s;s of this Cla&s;s, nothing con|tributes &s;o much as being capable to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">h what has been well written or &s;poken by others: Hence the proper Studies of this Cla&s;s, are Rhetoric and Poetry, from which ari&s;e Critici&s;m and Compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;peak fir&s;t of Rhetoric, as it is the fir&s;t Study. The Profe&s;&s;or begins with giving the Students a general Notion of the Precepts and different Kinds of <HI>Rhetoric,</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="007121_0019_102AF9619C147618">from <HI>Tully</HI> and <HI>Quintilian;</HI> then proceeds to make them read <HI>Tully</HI>'s Cration for <HI>Milo,</HI> lei&s;urely in its Original; applying, as they go along, the Precepts of Oratory; and making them apprehend its Plan, Series, Delicacy of Addre&s;s; the Strength and Di&s;po&s;ition of the Proofs; the Ju&s;tne&s;s of the Tropes and Figures; the Beauty of the Imagery and Painting; the Harmony and Fullne&s;s of the Periods; the Pomp and Purity of the Diction; and, in fine, that Grandeur of Thought; that a&s;toni&s;h|ing Sublime; that Torrent of Eloquence, which, mov|ing, warming, &s;eizing the Soul, &s;weeps all irre&s;i&s;tably down before it.&mdash;After this, <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI>'s Harangue for <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;iphon,</HI> which <HI>Tully</HI> calls the Model of perfect Elo|quence, is read in its Original, and explain'd in the &s;ame Manner.</P>
<P>The&s;e two celebrated Orations, thus explain'd and ap|prehended, are judged &s;ufficient to give Youth a right Idea of Oratory, and fix its Precepts in their Mind, which is not to be done &s;o much by reading many Ora|tions, as by &s;tudying a Few thoroughly: And therefore, only three more Orations, one in Greek, one in Latin, and one in Engli&s;h, are read in the School through the whole Year. The&s;e are &s;ucce&s;&s;ively handled thus: In the Evening the Profe&s;&s;or pre&s;cribes a certain Portion of the Oration, and appoints the Students to write out their Ob&s;ervations upon its Conformity to the Laws of Rhe|toric; the Plan, Thoughts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by Way of Critici&s;m; this they bring with them next Day to the Cla&s;s or School, when the Part pre&s;crib'd is read over, and this Critici&s;m of theirs examin'd and corrected. A new Portion, as before, is pre&s;crib'd again&s;t next Meeting, till in this Manner they have fini&s;h'd the whole three Orations.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame Manner is Poetry &s;tudy'd, which is, in|deed, rather the &s;ame than a different Study; Poetry being nothing el&s;e but the elde&s;t Daughter of Eloquence. The Arrangement of the Fable in the One corre&s;ponds to the Plan and Series of the Other. Tropes and Fi|gures they have in common: And where, in the Pecu|liarity
<PB N="21" REF="007121_0020_102AF963599C4A28">of her Dre&s;s, and the more frequent U&s;e of Epi|thets, <HI>&amp;c. Poetry</HI> affects to differ, the Youth are not unacquainted with it; as they have been made to ob&s;erve it in reading the Cla&s;&s;ic-Poets. The Rules, Nature and De&s;ign of the &s;everal Kinds of Poetry, are, in the fir&s;t Place explain'd; then, as in the Study of Rhetoric, they privately write a Piece of Critici&s;m upon them, beginning with the le&s;&s;er Kinds, as the Ode, Elegy, Satyr, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> proceeding to the Drama, Pa&s;toral and Epopaea. All the&s;e Critici&s;ms are carefully revis'd and corrected by the Profe&s;&s;or, which is all the public Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Cla&s;s. The Reading of <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s Poetry, and the be&s;t French and Engli&s;h Critics is allow'd, and even recommended, to a&s;&s;i&s;t and direct the Judgment of Youth in this Ex|erci&s;e.</P>
<P>Here I interrupted <HI>Evander,</HI> by telling him, that I thought this Study alone, might require half the Year. No, replied he; They don't &s;pend above eight Weeks on the Study of all the Kinds of Poetry. This is owing chiefly to the placing the Study of Poetry after Philo&s;o|phy and Rhetoric, which makes it extreme ea&s;y: And partly to the Age of the Youth, they being now, at lea&s;t, in their 18th Year, and capable of greater Application; partly to the Delight they take in the Study, and partly to their having read mo&s;t of the different Kinds of Poems, when learning Languages, which renders the Review of them plea&s;ant, in order to apply the Rules of Critici&s;m.&mdash;About a Fortnight is enough for all the le&s;&s;er Poems; the &s;ame Space of Time &s;erves for the Drama and Pa&s;toral, (which all but the Engli&s;h Critics examine by the Laws of the Drama) and la&s;tly, about a Month &s;erves for the Epopaea.&mdash;</P>
<P>The Remainder of the Year, which is about &s;ix Months, is &s;pent in compo&s;ing and delivering Orations; and 'tis no Wonder, that this Exerci&s;e is attended with great Succe&s;s, when defer'd to this its proper Sea&s;on. Philo&s;ophy, Rhetoric and Poetry, being &s;ufficiently ta&s;ted and admir'd; the Youth mu&s;t be animated, in
<PB N="22" REF="007121_0021_102AF966DD7ABCD8">their Compo&s;itions, to imitate tho&s;e bright Models that gave them &s;o much Plea&s;ure in the Reading. The Study of Poetry, in particular, teaches them a certain Elevation of Thought; makes them give lively De&s;criptions, with Strength, Variety, Copiou&s;ne&s;s and Harmony of Style; and diffu&s;e a Delicacy over every Thing they compo&s;e.&mdash;They begin fir&s;t with &s;maller E&s;&s;ays on proper Subjects; thence proceed to frame Orations according to the Pre|cepts, and on the Models, of perfect Eloquence: The&s;e the Profe&s;&s;or corrects, carefully pointing out where the Subject wou'd have requir'd more Conci&s;ene&s;s; where more Copiou&s;ne&s;s; where the figurative Style, and Gra|ces of Speech; where the Plain and Simple; where they ought to have ris'n; where fallen; where they have given Conceit in&s;tead of Wit; the forc'd and far-fetch'd, in&s;tead of the ea&s;y and natural; Bomba&s;t and Swelling, in&s;tead of the Sublime and Florid. Thus to correct one Oration and hear another (that has been corrected before) deliver'd, with proper Grace and Action, is all the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the Cla&s;s at one Meeting or Diet. Of this the Youth have their Turns, &s;o that when the Cla&s;s con&s;i&s;ts of twenty Students, each of them, in their Turns, com|po&s;e and deliver an Oration once in
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">When we allow but ten Days to compo&s;e an Oration, be&s;ides attending the Duties of the Cla&s;s: we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e their Pieces &s;hort.</NOTE> ten Days. And as they mu&s;t all be pre&s;ent at the correcting and deliver|ing two Orations each Day, they profit as much by the Faults or Beauties found in the Compo&s;itions of their School-Fellows, as by their own.&mdash;</P>
<P>In correcting the Compo&s;itions of Youth, however, the Profe&s;&s;or is &s;en&s;ible, that great Judgment and Art is requir'd: Always remembring that they are Youth, he is greatly careful not to di&s;courage them by too much Severity. If ever he &s;eems di&s;pleas'd at any Thing, it is when he di&s;covers a Sort of Stiffne&s;s, Preci&s;ion and Judgment in their Pieces above their Years, which he con&s;iders as a certain Sign of Coldne&s;s and Sterility;
<PB N="23" REF="007121_0022_102AF9695592BC50">while, on the other Hand, Redundancy of Thought, and &s;prightly Sallies of Imagination, &s;hare his di&s;tingui&s;h'd Indulgence. The&s;e he calls the blooming Shoots of Genius; and, tho' exuberant, thinks they are no more to be lopp'd off at an improper Sea&s;on, or in an un|&s;kilful Manner, than the luxuriant Growth of a thriving young Tree. It is dangerous for any Hand, but that of Time, to reduce the&s;e wholly within their proper Bounds.</P>
<P>I'm per&s;uaded, you will think it no Objection again&s;t the Study of Rhetoric, that it has often been pro&s;tituted to the vile&s;t Purpo&s;es. What is there that may not be abus'd by <HI>bad Men?</HI> But in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a <HI>good Man</HI> (and &s;uch my Countrymen are careful to form all their Youth) Eloquence is the mo&s;t glorious Gift of Nature. It makes Him the Sanctuary of the Unfortunate; the Protector of the Weak; the Support and Prai&s;e of the Good; and the eternal Terror and Controul of the Bad. We mu&s;t often addre&s;s to the Pa&s;&s;ions wou'd we reach the Heart. And till we can lay Body a&s;ide, and re|&s;olve our&s;elves into pure Spirit, 'tis proud unmeaning Jargon, to &s;ay we can reli&s;h naked unornamented Truth; or be ravi&s;h'd with the plain unaffected Beauties of Virtue.&mdash;The <HI>Miranians</HI> don't, however, propo&s;e to make Orators and Poets of their Youth, by the&s;e Studies. They are &s;en&s;ible both the Orator and Poet mu&s;t be born, not made. But, &s;ay they, tho&s;e to whom Nature has given a Genius for Compo&s;ition, either in Poetry or Pro&s;e, will be thus put in the Method of im|proving that Genius to the greate&s;t Advantage; and tho&s;e who have no &s;uch Genius, will, however, be en|abled, by the&s;e Studies to write elegantly, or at lea&s;t cor|rectly, in the epi&s;tolary Way, and on the common and mo&s;t important Concerns in Life.</P>
<P>Unle&s;s the Ta&s;te is thus form'd, and Youth taught to be &s;ound Critics, on the Beauties of tho&s;e celebrated Pieces that have challeng'd the Admiration of all Mankind, and &s;tood the Te&s;t of Time; unle&s;s they can di&s;cover wherein tho&s;e Beauties con&s;i&s;t;&mdash;what is Lear|ning?

<HEAD>FIFTH or highe&s;t CLASS.</HEAD>
<P>The Principal, who&s;e Name is <HI>Aratus,</HI> in&s;tructs this Cla&s;s in the Study of Agriculture and Hi&s;tory. The Knowlege of Nature acquir'd in the third Cla&s;s, con|tributes greatly to make the Study of Agriculture ea&s;y at this Time. In &s;ome previous Lectures <HI>Aratus</HI> re|&s;umes this Subject; and particularly gives the Youth a good Tincture of Phy&s;ic and animal Anatomy, which is not only of great U&s;e to teach them the proper Care of their own Health and Bodies; but highly nece&s;&s;ary to explain the Oeconomy and Mechani&s;m of Plants, the Structure of their Ve&s;&s;els, their Generation, Manner of Life and Accretion, Per&s;piration, Circulation of Sap, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Of all which, the &s;ure&s;t Way of giving any Idea, is by ob&s;erving and tracing the Analogy between Plants and Animals.&mdash;After this he examines, with the Youth, the mineral Strata of the Earth; enquires into the Nature of tho&s;e &s;aline and aqueous Juices that con&s;titute the nutri|tious Matter or Food of Vegetables; and of tho&s;e other Fo&s;&s;ils which, being either heterogeneous to the vege|table Sub&s;tance, or too gro&s;s and &s;cabrous to enter into the Roots of Plants, &s;erve however to &s;often and &s;epa|rate the concreted Parts of the <HI>Earth,</HI> and prepare it for the Ends of <HI>Vegetation.</HI> The Whole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> illu&s;trated by a Cour&s;e of chymical and &s;tatical Experiments.</P>
<P>The Theory of Vegetation once explain'd, and toler|ably under&s;tood; what remains in the Study of Hu&s;|bandry is not very difficult. For after obtaining a good In&s;ight into the vegetable Oeconomy, the Quality of Soils, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by the Analy&s;is of Plants, Fo&s;&s;ils and Air, the Youth are enabled to judge what Effect every Manure will have on every Soil; what is the proper Manner of
<PB N="27" REF="007121_0026_102AF9724F96FB68">preparing the Ground for the Seed; and what Seed or Plant &s;hou'd be a&s;&s;ign'd each natural Earth. In this chiefly con&s;i&s;ts the Hu&s;bandman's Art. After this Foundation is laid, they proceed to read the be&s;t <HI>Geo|ponic</HI> Writers, &s;uch as <HI>Varro, Columella, Tull, Bradley, &amp;c.</HI> a&s;&s;igning, as they go along, the rationale, for the natural Phenomena and Rules of Tillage, recorded in the&s;e Authors, upon the Principles and Philo&s;ophy of modern Naturali&s;ts.</P>
<P>One Part of the Day is given thro' the Year, to the Study of Agriculture, as laid down above: The Re|mainder to the Study of Hi&s;tory; by which, it is plain I do not mean the Reading of Hi&s;tory to &s;atisfy the Cu|rio&s;ity for a Moment, with the Knowlege of &s;ingle un|relative Facts; which, to their great Lo&s;s is all that Youth generally profit by Hi&s;tory, at the Age, and ac|cording to the Method, it is handled at Colleges.&mdash;In the Cour&s;e of the above-mentioned Studies, and from their private Reading for Amu&s;ement, the <HI>Miranian-Youth,</HI> I need not tell you, mu&s;t by this Time have a pretty full Knowlege of the principal Events that hap|pened in the World before they were born. The Bu&s;i|ne&s;s of this Cla&s;s is of a far more noble and exten&s;ive Nature. It is to review tho&s;e Events in the calm <HI>Light of Philo&s;ophy,</HI> when related in their full Extent, attended with a Deduction of their immediate and remote Cau&s;es and Con&s;equences, in order to make them a Le&s;&s;on of <HI>Ethics</HI> and <HI>Politics,</HI>&mdash; an u&s;eful Rule of Conduct and Manners thro' Life. It is dangerous to &s;end raw un|practis'd Virtue abroad into a World where Right and Wrong are too often confounded; and nothing can ob|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e this Danger but the giving Youth a previous Ac|quaintance with the World, and making them behold Virtue and Vice with all their Con&s;equences painted in genuine Colors by the Hi&s;torian. Numerous are the Evils that ari&s;e in Society when Youth are &s;ent into it, e&s;pecially in any high Station without this Knowlege. In this Ca&s;e neither Logics, Mathematics, Phy&s;ics, Rhe|toric,
<PB N="28" REF="007121_0027_102AF9742A6F4FD0">nor all the Branches of &s;peculative Knowlege they are capable of attaining can direct their Conduct, nor prevent their falling a Prey to de&s;igning Men. The&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ciences, however, if we do not &s;top at them, are high|ly u&s;eful, and render the Studies of this Cla&s;s, plea&s;ant and profitable. As the Study of Agriculture was made ea&s;y by the previous Knowlege in natural Philo&s;ophy; &s;o is the previous Knowlege of the fundamental Princi|ples of Ethics, a fine Introduction to the Philo&s;ophical Study of Hi&s;tory. This Subject <HI>Aratus</HI> re&s;umes before entring upon Hi&s;tory. He con&s;iders Man in the &s;olitary State of <HI>Nature,</HI> &s;urrounded with Wants and Dangers, the whole Species at Enmity with one another, the &s;tron|ger lording it over the weaker, and nothing &s;ecure to any Man, but what he can either acquire or maintain by Violence: From thence he takes Occa&s;ion to &s;hew the Nece&s;&s;ity Mankind lay under, of entering into Society, and voluntarily re&s;igning &s;ome Share of their natural Freedom and Property to &s;ecure the Re&s;t. Then he explains the different Forms of Government with the Advantages, and Inconveniencies in the Admini&s;tration of each.</P>
<P>This being pren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s'd, the Youth enter upon the Study of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Hi&s;tory in this Manner, <HI>viz.</HI> the Principal pre&s;cribes a Portion of it, which again&s;t next Day they mu&s;t read in their Chambers, and abrige the Sub&s;tance of it into Writing, about twice or thrice as large as a copious Argument of any Chapter. This fixes the Facts deeply in their Minds; teaches them moreover to expre&s;s them&s;elves in a &s;hort laconic Man|ner when Occa&s;ion requires it; and when the Hi&s;tory is fini&s;h'd, &s;erves as a Recapitulation of the Whole, to which they may always have Recour&s;e thro' Life, and bring the Facts fre&s;h into their Memory. The&s;e Sum|maries are revis'd in the Cla&s;s by the Principal, who is careful to make them apprehend the Blameable and Prai&s;e-worthy in the Con&s;titution of the &s;everal <HI>Grecian</HI> States; and, in the familiar Way of Dialogue, to make

From the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> VIIths Reign, to the End of Queen <HI>Ann</HI>'s, is what they &s;tudy; and that Part of <HI>Rapin,</HI> with the Continuation to the End of the Third Queen <HI>Ann</HI> takes up about five Months. They conclude the whole with a View of our Colonies in this Hemi&s;phere; their State, Produce, Intere&s;ts, Government, &amp;c; taking &s;ome Notice as they go along, of the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI> Settlements we are chiefly concern'd with in Trade. Every Sunday Night about an Hour is &s;pent in the Study of the Bible Hi&s;tory.</P>

Tho' this is but a &s;mall Part of the Hi&s;tory of Man|kind, yet it is as much as can conveniently be brought, and much more than generally is brought, into a Scheme of collegiate Education. The Youth are thus &s;ent into the World well acquainted with the Hi&s;tory of tho&s;e Nations they are likely to be mo&s;t concerned with in Life; and al&s;o with the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> which may be ju&s;tly call'd the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Heroi&s;m, Virtue</HI> and <HI>Patrioti&s;m.</HI> This is enough to prepare them for Society, and put them in the Method of &s;tudying the Hi&s;tory of any other Nations they think proper, in a philo&s;ophical Manner, whenever their Inclination and Lei&s;ure &s;hall prompt them to it.</P>
<P>This, continued <HI>Evander,</HI> is a Sketch of the Studies of the &s;everal Cla&s;&s;es; which I could with Plea&s;ure, in this Account, pur&s;ue thro' all their different Ramificati|ons. But as this is incon&s;i&s;tent with my de&s;ign'd Bre|vity, I have only mention'd the general Heads of Science, wholly neglecting &s;uch Branches as are either included in, or nece&s;&s;ary to, the Knowledge of tho&s;e I have men|tion'd.&mdash;In the Second Cla&s;s, you will ob&s;erve I have not &s;poke a Word of plain Trigonometry, becau&s;e it is &s;uppos'd in the Study of Geometry. Neither have I mention'd Per&s;pective, Painting, &amp;c. becau&s;e included in the beautiful Sciences of Optics; nor even Optics them&s;elves, nor &s;pherical Trigonometry, as they are all &s;uppos'd in the general Study of A&s;tronomy. In like Manner, I have not mention'd Dialing, becau&s;e after being taught A&s;tronomy, and the U&s;e of the Globes, the whole Theory of Dialing is learn'd in a few Hours: And &s;o of all the other Cla&s;&s;es, which I take Notice of expre&s;sly, that you may not judge the Studies of any one Cla&s;s unproportion'd to tho&s;e of another, without taking into the Account all their Branches, Praecognita, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>&mdash;Here I told <HI>Evander,</HI> that I was well enough &s;a|tisfy'd the Studies of the Cla&s;&s;es were very well pro|portion'd, as they become &s;till more exten&s;ive the far|ther the Youth advance in Years; but that I thought
<PB N="31" REF="007121_0030_102AF97BC6708F40">the Studies of every Cla&s;s were more than Youth could probably become &s;ufficiently acquainted with in the Time allotted them.</P>
<P>He reply'd, that if the <HI>Miranian</HI> Youth did not at|tend the Duties of the College longer than the ordinary Terms, my Ob&s;ervation would be ju&s;t. But, continued he, my Countrymen are entirely again&s;t long Vacancies, and interrupting the Studies of Youth for half the Year. They can't &s;ee any Advantage in &s;uch a Practice; and are certain that it is attended with many Inconveniencies. Vacations and holy Days in this College, don't exceed two Months. Be&s;ides, they don't propo&s;e any Thing more than to give the Youth a general Knowlege and Tincture of the&s;e Studies. This is all that can be done at College: For as Bent of Genius will not carry all the Youth of a Cla&s;s the &s;ame Lengths in every Study; that Scheme of Education is humanly perfect, by which all the Students may become ordinary Proficients in all the Studies; and are put in a Method of excelling in tho&s;e particular Sciences to which Nature has bent their Ge|nius. The

But, tho' my Countrymen could af|ford Salaries for &s;uch a Number of Pofe&s;&s;ors, they would never give into this Method; for they think it a great
<PB N="32" REF="007121_0031_102AF97E54C1A4F8">Di&s;advantage to Youth, to be concern'd with two many Ma&s;ters and Studies at the &s;ame Time. They judge it a much better Method, that &s;uch Branches of Science as are related to one another, &s;hould be thoro'ly &s;tudied under one and the &s;ame Ma&s;ter, before the Youth pro|ceed farther; and that the whole Studies or Branches of Science, &s;hou'd be rang'd in their natural Order; that tho&s;e of each lower Cla&s;s may be an Introduction to the Cla&s;s above it, and the Youth thus rais'd by a Chain of ea&s;y Steps to the Summit of their Education. Hence a Profe&s;&s;or &s;erves, by the above Scheme, for all the Branches of Knowlege that can be acquir'd in one Year; which re&s;olves the Cla&s;&s;es and Ma&s;ters into a Number proportion'd to the Number of Years; and renders the whole Plan plain and regular.</P>
<P>That the Studies laid down for the five foregoing Cla&s;&s;es, are rang'd in their natural Order, will be&s;t ap|pear to tho&s;e who are be&s;t acquainted with the Nature and Object of them. I &s;hall not trouble you, then, with any Defence of what may appear an Innovation of the Method of Study in the&s;e Cla&s;&s;es; &s;ince you will allow, when you con&s;ider the whole attentively, that to change this Order ever &s;o little wou'd greatly confound and retard the Execution. With Regard to the three lower Cla&s;&s;es, there can be no Objection; as Mathema|tics go before Philo&s;ophy in every Seminary; and are &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to it, that Mr. <HI>Locke,</HI> I think, advi&s;es the Study of Mathematics &s;uppo&s;e we &s;hould propo&s;e no other Advantage by them than to &s;trengthen the rea&s;o|ning Faculty, and prepare the Mind for the Study of Philo&s;ophy, by accu&s;toming it to think clo&s;ely, and call forth tho&s;e Thoughts in a &s;y&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">matical Manner.</P>
<P>That Rhetoric, Poetry, Critici&s;m and Compo&s;ition, &s;hould be learn'd after Philo&s;ophy, &s;eems decided by the Authority of the greate&s;t Orators and Poets.&mdash;Thus<HI>Horace&mdash;Scribendi recte, &s;apere e&s;t &amp; Principium &amp; Fons.</HI>&mdash;Thus <HI>Tul'y</HI> blames the Orators of his Time for neglecting the Study of Philo&s;ophy and polite Literature,
<PB N="33" REF="007121_0032_102AF9806B9F30C8">&mdash;<HI>Nemo vederetur exqui&s;itius quam Vulgus Hominium &s;tudui&s;&s;e Literis, quibus Fons perfec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Eloquentiae conti|netur; Nemo qui Philo&s;ophiam complexus e&s;&s;et, Matrem O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ium bene Factorum, beneque Dictorum.

Eloquence is generally the &s;ublime&s;t Philo&s;ophy; now it is ab&s;urd to &s;peak of writing or compo&s;ing philo&s;ophi|cally till we are Philo&s;ophers; or of writing elegantly without a Ta&s;te for polite Letters. In Reality, no Man but he who can di&s;tingui&s;h philo&s;ophically between Right and Wrong, (the <HI>Honestum &amp; Turpe</HI>) and who is po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd of all the moral Virtues, can be a good Orator, for this Rea&s;on that no Man can move others, unle&s;s he him&s;elf is mov'd with what he &s;peaks. A bad Man may, to give his Words Force, &s;eem mov'd when he rea&s;ons of Virtue; but whenever his Character <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s fully detected, all his mo&s;t artful Pretences this Way will only, &s;o much the more, &s;hock his Audience.</P>
<P>Here I a&s;k'd <HI>Evander,</HI> why foreign Univer&s;ities, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> plac'd Rhetoric before Philo&s;ophy, if the latter was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to it? He an&s;wer'd, that as far as he could learn, the Difference between the Method of his Coun|trymen, and that of the be&s;t model'd Colleges, was not material. 'Tis true, &s;aid he, the&s;e Colleges begin the Study of Rhetoric in the lower Cla&s;&s;es, but they continue it thro' the higher Ones. Thus the fir&s;t Year perhaps the Youth learn no more than the Figures of Speech, and the Precepts; the Knowelege of Logic and Gram|mar is enough for this Purpo&s;e. Compo&s;ition, Criti|ci&s;m, and that Part of Rhetoric to which Philo&s;ophy and polite Letters are nece&s;&s;ary, fall of Cour&s;e after the Study of Philo&s;ophy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which is the &s;ame Thing upon the Whole; unle&s;s that it is incon&s;i&s;tent with this Maxim of my Countrymen, never to engage Youth in more than one or two Studies till they are fully Ma&s;ters
<PB N="34" REF="007121_0033_102AF9834D5AC708">of them; and to render their Plan as &s;imple as po&s;&s;ible, that they may &s;tand in need of no more Profe&s;&s;ors and Tutors than their Circum&s;tances enable them to employ; the &s;ole Con&s;ideration that ever makes them depart from the Practice of Nations more learn'd than them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I pre&s;ume, I need offer no Rea&s;ons for placing the Studies of Agriculture, Hi&s;tory and Politics in the high|e&s;t Cla&s;s. As the&s;e Studies &s;eldom enter into the Scheme of Education, but are left for every Man's private read|ing after his Education at the Univer&s;ity is fini&s;hed, it is plain they &s;hould be la&s;t. They are indeed the Studies of Men, and require a ripe Judgment. But moreover all the former Studies, as I have ob&s;erv'd already, are nece&s;&s;ary and &s;ub&s;ervient to them. Even Rhetoric her|&s;elf is of great U&s;e in reading a well-wrote Hi&s;tory, as the Beauties of the Diction and Speeches mu&s;t otherwi&s;e be in &s;ome Degree lo&s;t and unta&s;ted. And if this was not the Ca&s;e, yet &s;till, methinks, Hi&s;tory and Agriculture &s;hould be plac'd la&s;t, in order to &s;end Youth abroad into the World, warm (if I may &s;o expre&s;s it) from tho&s;e Studies which their own Intere&s;ts, and the Service of their Country will require them chiefly to cultivate till Death.</P>
<P>The next Thing to be &s;poken of is the public Exer|ci&s;es of the&s;e five Cla&s;&s;es; for the <HI>Miranians</HI> are fully convinc'd of the great Advantages con&s;equent upon bringing Youth early to &s;peak in Public; and therefore have &s;et all the Saturdays of the Year wholly apart for this Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e Days, the Ma&s;ters, Scholars, and as ma|ny of the Citizens as plea&s;e to attend, being a&s;&s;embled in the Chapel after Morning Prayers; one of the Stu|dents in the Fir&s;t or <HI>Greek</HI> Cla&s;s appears as Re&s;pondent with an Opponent or Interrogator from the Third Cla&s;s; the latter pitches upon any <HI>Greek</HI> Author, the Re&s;pon|dent has read during the Cour&s;e of the Year in his Cla&s;s, and pre&s;cribes a Pa&s;&s;age in it to be render'd into Engli&s;h <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">empore;</HI> this the Re&s;pondent does, pointing out the
<PB N="35" REF="007121_0034_102AF98590738088">Author's Beauties, Spirit and Sentiments; clearing up his Ob&s;curities and Difficulties; and giving an Account of the Ca&s;e, Ten&s;e, Mood, Derivation, Con&s;truction, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of every Word. The Opponent takes Care to &s;et him right where he errs; and gives him an Opportunity, by proper Interrogations, to di&s;play his Skill and Improve|ments to the be&s;t Advantage. The Ma&s;ter of that Cla&s;s to which the Opponent belongs, &s;uperintends the&s;e Exer|ci&s;es, and may interfere with his A&s;&s;i&s;tance if there &s;hou'd be Occa&s;ion. But this &s;eldom happens.&mdash;</P>
<P>After the&s;e, one of the 2d Cla&s;s appears as Re&s;pondent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with an Opponent from the 4th, the Opponent endeavors to impugn a The&s;is given out and defended by the Re|&s;pondent. Then he changes the Subject and interrogates him concerning his Skill in &s;uch Branches of the Mathe|matics as he (the Re&s;pondent) has learn'd in his Cla&s;s.</P>
<P>In the next Place, a Re&s;pondent appears from the 3d Cla&s;s with an Opponent from the 5th. The Method of Exerci&s;e the &s;ame as above. The Subject Ethics and Phy&s;ics.&mdash;</P>
<P>Be&s;ides bearing a Part, as Interrogators, in the fore|going Exerci&s;es, the 4th and 5th Cla&s;&s;es have an Exerci&s;e of Declamation peculiar to them&s;elves. Fir&s;t one of the Youth in the Cla&s;s of Rhetoric delivers a Speech with proper Grace and Action on any philo&s;ophical Subject, or on the Nature, Rules and Advantages of Eloquence and Poetry, which are their pre&s;ent Studies.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, one of the 5th or highe&s;t Cla&s;s delivers an Oration, fram'd according to the exact Rules of Rhetoric, upon any civil Topic that is, or may be, di&s;puted with Regard to the Intere&s;t of their Country. And &s;uch Ha|rangues I have often known to be of very public Service, not only when deliver'd, but when thought worthy of appearing in Print. Sometimes too their Subject is the U&s;efulne&s;s of Hi&s;tory and Agriculture; the Plea&s;ures of Retirement, or any moral Subject. Thus when there are not above twenty Boys in each Cla&s;s, every Boy in the three lower Cla&s;&s;es appears in public twice a Year, and
<PB N="36" REF="007121_0035_102AF987191B17F0">tho&s;e of the two higher Cla&s;&s;es four Times.&mdash;There are Exerci&s;es of the &s;ame Kind in the higher Cla&s;&s;es of the Mechanic's School: And in the Latin School, in&s;tead of Exerci&s;es or public Acts, there are quarterly Ex|aminations; and proper Rewards di&s;tributed to ex|cite Emulation.</P>
<P>Under this Article it may be proper to ob&s;erve that the fourth, or Cla&s;s of Rhetoric, on the King's Birth-Night, entertain the Town with &s;ome of our be&s;t dramatic Per|formances. And at their Commencement, the fifth Cla&s;s do the &s;ame. On the&s;e Occa&s;ions, they are honor'd with the Pre&s;ence of the Governor and all the Ladies and Gentlemen of Di&s;tinction. But the three lower Cla&s;&s;es, as they have not been taught Rhetoric, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are not per|m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ed a Share in this; nor are the&s;e two higher Cla&s;&s;es <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">llow'd to exhibit any more, but this one Performance a-piece; as it wou'd interfere with the Duties of the Cla&s;s to prepare them&s;elves for more: And this is &s;uf|ficient to teach Them this &s;ort of Exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>There is one Thing peculiar to the <HI>Miranians</HI> in the&s;e Exerci&s;es, which I had almo&s;t forgot to mention; and that is that all their public Acts, Declamations, <HI>&amp;c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the Engli&s;h Tongue. No People are more careful than they to teach Youth to tran&s;late Latin readily, as may appear in the Cour&s;e of the foremention'd Studies, where every Author is read in the Original: But, when this is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ttain'd, they aim at nothing more. They are &s;en&s;ible, there is a great Difference between being able to explain a Cla&s;&s;ic Author extempore, and the Writing as good Language as that Author. Almo&s;t any Per&s;on may at|tain to the fir&s;t:&mdash; But only an <HI>Era&s;mus,</HI> a <HI>Ca&s;imir,</HI> a <HI>Buchanan,</HI> and a few more, have wrote pure cla&s;&s;ic La|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in, unmixt with Barbari&s;ms and foreign Idioms, &s;ince it became a dead Language. They don't however, deny, but learned Men, to render their Works more univer&s;ally u&s;eful, may write in the Latin-Tongue, tho' they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">annot write with cla&s;&s;ic Elegance and Purity. But they greatly condemn the Practice of neglecting the Mo|ther-Tongue,
<PB N="37" REF="007121_0036_102AF98947E11ED0">and embara&s;&s;ing a young Student, by obliging him to &s;peak or compo&s;e in a dead Language. While he is hunting after Words to explain Him&s;elf by, he mu&s;t be continually on the Rack; one Half of his Sentiments, one Half of his &s;prightly Sallies of Fancy, which wou'd otherwi&s;e &s;hine thro' his Compo&s;itions, mu&s;t e&s;cape his Memory ere he can find Words to ex|pre&s;s them. The Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;peaking improperly, often barbarou&s;ly, mu&s;t damp his Ardor, and re&s;train him from delivering him&s;elf with that becoming Ea&s;e and Confidence, that Grace of Voice and Action, that Pro|priety and Harmony, which he cou'd not fail of, did he apply that Time and Pains to the Engli&s;h-Tongue, which is often without Succe&s;s given to the Latin.&mdash;Be&s;ides, my Countrymen &s;eem to think it below their Dignity, to declaim in a foreign Tongue, before an Engli&s;h Au|dience. In particular, my Friend, continued <HI>Evander,</HI> very gaily; to &s;peak in Latin, we think, wou'd be an In&s;ult on our Ladies, who often honor us with their Pre|&s;ence on tho&s;e Occa&s;ions; and, by their brilliant Ap|pearance, add new Grace to the Action, new Mu&s;ic to the Tongues, new Sprightline&s;s to the Imagination, and new Fire to the Bo&s;oms of the Youth.&mdash;</P>
<P>There are likewi&s;e Ma&s;ters in the College for teaching the French, Italian, Spani&s;h and German Tongues, at private Hours; and a Fencing-Ma&s;ter, who, be&s;ides the U&s;e of the Sword, teaches the military Exerci&s;e. There is, la&s;tly, a Dancing-Ma&s;ter; whom I &s;hou'd have mention'd fir&s;t; as this Art is learn'd by the Boys when very young; <HI>viz.</HI> in the lowe&s;t Cla&s;&s;es of the Latin and Mechanic's School. None of the Youth, how|ever, are oblig'd by the Statutes of the College to attend the&s;e Ma&s;ters; and if they do attend them, it mu&s;t be before they are enter'd into the fourth or rhetorical Cla&s;s, becau&s;e it wou'd interfere with the Duties of the two higher Cla&s;&s;es, which, as you'll remember, con&s;i&s;ts chie|fly in Reading and Writing in private. The Students in the&s;e two Cla&s;&s;es are e&s;teem'd Men; and it is reckon'd
<PB N="38" REF="007121_0037_102AF98C2EE9C400">&s;hameful for them to be ignorant of Dancing, Fencing and modern Languages till that Time.&mdash;None of the&s;e Ma&s;ters are included in the In&s;titution, in any other Thing, but that the Governors or Tru&s;tees upon any Complaint that their Characters are bad and their Ex|ample dangerous, may deprive them of the Benefit of teaching the Youth; A Puni&s;hment great enough: For, tho' they have no Salaries from the Public, yet as each of them has generally thrice the Number of Boys that are in any of the Cla&s;&s;es, their Income is nothing inferior to the Income of the Ma&s;ters that are upon the E&s;tabli&s;h|ment. And the College al&s;o gives each of them, that behave well, a hand&s;om Gratuity yearly; as a Te&s;ti|mony of their being willing to encourage the Learning of all polite Arts and manly Exerci&s;es among the Youth.</P>
<P>Here <HI>Evander</HI> paus'd, as if in Expectation of &s;ome Remarks from me upon the Excellency of the In&s;titution he had given me an Account of. I told him that as far as he had yet proceeded I mightily approv'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> But that I thought the Study of Religion, without which no Scheme of Education cou'd be of Advantage to the State or private Per&s;ons, did not &s;ufficiently enter into his Account; and that if the <HI>Miranians</HI> did nothing more this Way than he had &s;poken of, I judg'd their Scheme deficient in the mo&s;t intere&s;ting Article.</P>
<P>He re&s;um'd, that my Ob&s;ervation was ju&s;t; and that it was for this very Rea&s;on he had left the Account of their Method of &s;tudying Religion and Morals to a &s;e|parate Article; as well, becau&s;e of their Importance, as becau&s;e they are the chief Object of the Studies of every Cla&s;s, and con&s;equently cou'd not be brought into the Account of any particular Cla&s;s.</P>
<P>My Countrymen, proceeded he, are fully per&s;uaded that tho&s;e who are entru&s;ted with the Education of Youth can do more la&s;ting Service to the <HI>Intere&s;ts</HI> of <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Virtue,</HI> at a Time when the Heart is &s;u&s;ceptible of every Impre&s;&s;ion, than all the good Men, all the Philo|&s;ophers, all the Magi&s;trates, arm'd with all the Power, of
<PB N="39" REF="007121_0038_102AF98E0CF68AE0">a Country, can do, if, for Want of Education, the Heart is &s;uffer'd to become callous, as it were, and ob&s;tinate in the Habits of Vice. They were, therefore, extreme careful to look for &s;omething &s;till better than Learning in all the Ma&s;ters they cho&s;e into the Seminary; admit|ting none but Men of irreproachable Characters; MEN who&s;e Lives &s;hou'd be a daily Comment on their Precepts, and their genuine Goodne&s;s of Heart a con&s;tant Pledge for the Morals of the Youth committed to their Care; Men indefatigable in the Di&s;charge of their Duty from a Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the weighty Tru&s;t repos'd in them, and an unfeign'd Zeal for the pre&s;ent and future Intere&s;ts of their Pupils; Men, in a Word form'd to command Love and Reverence; and from their Sweetne&s;s of Temper di&s;pos'd to &s;trew the Path to Science with Ro&s;es.

<P>Thus have I, as briefly as I could, given you a Sketch of the Method of teaching Science and natural Religion in the&s;e five higher Cla&s;&s;es. The &s;ame is to be under|&s;tood of the higher Cla&s;&s;es in the Mechanics School, where the &s;ame Opportunities of inculcating natural Goodne&s;s offer in the Study of Phy&s;ics and Hi&s;tory, tho' in a Method &s;omewhat different. To this I have added a few of the Advantages my Country-Men have in Part reap'd, and mu&s;t more and more reap from &s;uch an In&s;titution. There is only one Thing wanting to im|prove and perfect the whole; and that is the Study of <HI>ceveal'd Religion,</HI> by which I mean the general uncon|troverted Principles of Chri&s;tianity, which is all they teach at College. For this Purpo&s;e the Sunday Evenings are &s;et apart; when about an Hour is &s;pent, in all the Cla&s;&s;es, in the Study of the Old and New Te&s;tament; the Law and hi&s;torical Parts being chiefly left for the

For when every proper Opportunity is embraced throughout the Week, to lay in &s;uch a Fund of natural Religion and Goodne&s;s, as I have &s;hewn above; the great Truths of Chri&s;tianity cannot fail of a favorable Reception on the Sundays, whether they come from the Ma&s;ters in the Evening Cla&s;&s;es; or from the Pulpit in the Time of di|vine Service.&mdash;Ea&s;y and delightful mu&s;t the Ta&s;k of the Clergy be, when by the Con&s;titution of a Country the whole In&s;tructors of Youth go Hand in Hand with them in advancing the Intere&s;ts of Vertue and Piety!&mdash; Happy, &s;aid <HI>Evander</HI> (his Face brightening with a lau|dable Exce&s;s of Fondne&s;s for his Country) Happy are the People that are in &s;uch a Ca&s;e!&mdash;Is it po&s;&s;ible to figure aught more venerable and augu&s;t than the whole Wi&s;dom and Experience of a Community thus u&s;ing every human Effort, to train up, and &s;ecure to the State, a Succe&s;&s;ion of good Men and good Citizens to the late&s;t Generations?

Here al&s;o all public Exa|minations, public Acts and Orations on the Saturdays; Commencements, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are held.&mdash;The Floor over this, of the &s;ame Length, is the <HI>public Hall,</HI> where the Youth eat in public; and where all public Entertain|ments, Balls, Plays, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are given. The Cielings of the&s;e two Floors being very high, this Building is of the &s;ame Height with the other Sides of the Square, where the Buildings con&s;i&s;t of three Floors or Stories each. This Chapel and public Hall are capable of re|ceiving &s;everal Hundreds of People, be&s;ides all the Youth of the Seminary. They are each of them well &s;eated along the Walls, leaving a large Space in the Middle empty. The Chapel has a very beautiful Ro&s;trum.&mdash;</P>

But the Building being 26 f. wide, 8 f. is left towards the Area which con&s;titutes a Piazza or Portico, 100 f. long, &s;upported by a deli|cate

This Method of making a Door for every Cla&s;s, will be found of great Service to let the particular Cla&s;&s;es go out and come in without di&s;turbing one ano|ther, when the Curtains are &s;hut; and when the Scho|lars become &s;o numerous as to require a Ma&s;ter for every Cla&s;s.

They have likewi&s;e a Door, Chimney and two Windows each. Before the&s;e Cla&s;&s;es, and over the Portico is a Gallery, of the &s;ame Breadth of 8 f. and Length of 100. This Gallery, as their Circum&s;tances permit, is to be adorn'd with all curious Hi&s;tory-Painting for the Im|provement of Ta&s;te.

<P>The fourth or <HI>We&s;t-Building,</HI> is divided in the Centre by the public Entrance to the Area, which is an Arch 10 f. wide; and has a &s;trong Gate which is &s;hut every Night.

In every Thing &s;trict Decorum and Oeconomy are ob&s;erv'd. The <HI>Meals</HI> are plain, neat and plentiful. Every Scholar pays his Proportion of the monthly Bill.

<P>This is a rude Sketch of the whole In&s;titution as it is at pre&s;ent: It remains to take Notice, according to my Promi&s;e, of the chief Steps taken in the E&s;tabli&s;hment of it.&mdash;The foregoing Plans of Education and Building being &s;ketch'd out and agreed upon, a Charter was obtain'd incorporating a certain Number of Gentlemen by the Name of <HI>Tru&s;tees,</HI> with Powers to carry the &s;aid Plans into Execution, as far as they &s;hould be enabled by public or private Contributions; and make &s;uch Improvements of them as &s;hou'd &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary, keeping always up to the original Intent of the In&s;titution. To enable Them to open the Seminary, a Law was made applying the Intere&s;t of a Sum that had formerly been rais'd, as Sala|ries for In&s;tructors, in &s;uch Proportions as they &s;hou'd judge proper. But this Sum being in&s;ufficient to employ any more In&s;tructors than would be nece&s;&s;ary for the fir&s;t Year; about an hundred public-&s;pirited Gentlemen &s;ub|&s;cribed to pay, for the Space of five Years, &s;uch Propor|tions of any Sum not exceeding 600 <HI><ABBR>l.</ABBR> per An.</HI> as the encrea&s;ing Number of In&s;tructors, &s;hou'd render nece&s;&s;ary; hoping before the Expiration of that Term a &s;ufficient Sum might be rais'd for Endowment.</P>
<P>Thus authoris'd, and enabled, the Tru&s;tees apply'd them&s;elves with all po&s;&s;ible Diligence, Prudence and Unanimity to the Execution of their weighty Tru&s;t; and in the fir&s;t Place to engage three proper Per&s;ons to open the Mechanic's and Latin School, and the Greek or
<PB N="65" REF="007121_0064_102AF9CBCADAAFC0">lowe&s;t Cla&s;s of what they call the College. This was the mo&s;t difficult Part of their Work. Men duly qualified were not ea&s;ily to be met with; and tho&s;e who were be&s;t quality'd were mo&s;t backward to engage; as having an adequate Idea of the Importance and Difficulty of the Work they were invited to. They fore&s;aw that even the greate&s;t Prudence, with the mo&s;t indefatigable Labor and Vigilance, cou'd not command Succe&s;s in the Beginning of &s;uch a Work, unle&s;s they further laid their Account to bear patiently Reproaches, Slanders and the very Mar|tyrdom of their Characters from a Few.&mdash;(&s;hall I di&s;grace my Country by naming Them!)&mdash;a few lurking Traitors, who did not blu&s;h to throw Dirt at every Propo&s;al for e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;uch an u&s;eful In&s;titution in <HI>Mirania;</HI> either becau&s;e they Them&s;elves cou'd not model it to their own Minds, or that they might favor the Intere&s;ts of tho&s;e that were already &s;o model'd in other Places. This and every other Ob&s;tacle, however, the laudable Zeal of the Tru&s;tees &s;urmounted. They prevail'd upon the three Men, who are now, <HI>Principal, Vice-Principal,</HI> or <HI>Ma&s;|ter</HI> of the <HI>Mechanic</HI>'s School, and <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> of the Latin-School, to open their re&s;pective Parts of the Seminary in a Hou&s;e of the City &s;et a&s;ide for this U&s;e, till the Edi|fice &s;hou'd be fini&s;h'd; a&s;&s;uring the&s;e Men, that they, as Tru&s;tees, wou'd not only &s;upport them in the Di&s;|charge of their Office, but that they might depend on being al&s;o &s;upported by the concurring Intere&s;t and Countenance of every Man of Worth in the Province. Happy was it for the Province, that Men of &s;uch di&s;|tingui&s;h'd Zeal were pitch'd upon as Tru&s;tees; and hap|py was it for the Tru&s;tees that Heaven directed them, in the fir&s;t In&s;tance, to the Choice of &s;uch Ma&s;ters! To the&s;e concurring Circum&s;tances, under GOD, may be a&s;crib'd all that Reputation, the Seminary has acquir'd. The Ma&s;ters as el&s;ewhere ob&s;erv'd, are truly affable, indefatigable and patient; which renders their Method of Communication familiar and &s;ecure. If at any Time the Youth &s;hou'd not &s;eem to comprehend their Meaning
<PB N="66" REF="007121_0065_102AF9CF63B0DB28">thoroughly, they vary their Method, and expo&s;e what they wou'd communicate in every po&s;&s;ible Light, being apt, always, rather to &s;u&s;pect their own Want of Method and Per&s;picuity of Addre&s;s, than any Defect of Genius or Atten|tention in the Youth. <HI>Learning</HI> in them, tho' univer&s;al, is but a &s;econdary Qualification. Their amiable Tem|per, mild Behaviour, Forbearance and Placability, have long &s;ince &s;truck Envy and Calumny dumb. Supported by the Te&s;timony of a good Con&s;cience, and the Coun|tenance of the better Part of their Citizens, the Slanders of their Enemies had no other Effect upon them, but to quicken their Toils, make them redouble their Di|ligence, in their Country's Service; and, with the Phi|lo&s;opher of old, live and act &s;o, that no Per&s;on &s;hou'd believe any Thing to their Prejudice. On the Model of their Virtues, the other Ma&s;ters, admitted from Time to Time into the Seminary, thought it their Honor and Duty to form Them&s;elves, and &s;ecure general E&s;teem. The <HI>Principal</HI> is a Clergyman of the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Religion of the Country, which was deem'd a rea&s;onable Com|pliment, to the Con&s;titution; but, by an expre&s;s Act of the Corporation, he forfeits his Place by accepting any pa&s;toral Cure, or following any other Profe&s;&s;ion. The Government of &s;uch a Seminary, and teaching the high|e&s;t Cla&s;s, was deem'd &s;ufficient Bu&s;ine&s;s for one Man; and Bu&s;ine&s;s too of &s;uch a Nature, as to entitle the Man, who di&s;charges it con&s;cientiou&s;ly, to hand&s;ome Encourage|ment from his Country, without uniting incon&s;i&s;tent Offices to patch up a Living for Him.&mdash; There are, however, &s;ome of the other Profe&s;&s;ors that are allow'd to encrea&s;e their Income, by &s;erving as Clergymen, Phy|&s;icians, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the City. This was not thought incon|&s;i&s;tent, as they have little other Care of the College up|on them, but attending their re&s;pective Cla&s;&s;es duly at proper Hours; which Hours they mu&s;t keep &s;acred; and upon no Pretence whatever break in upon them.&mdash;</P>
<P>The Seminary being thus opened, every private School, in or near the City, was &s;uppre&s;t. For &s;uch
<PB N="67" REF="007121_0066_102AF9D21C0C9290">Schools there was now no U&s;e, the Province having, as it were, taken the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Education out of pri|vate into public Hands, and open'd one general School, calculated for training up all Ranks and Conditions of People, in the &s;ure&s;t and lea&s;t expen&s;ive Method, to be good Men and good Citizens in their proper Spheres. Without this Step, the Cla&s;&s;es cou'd never have been fill'd; and the whole Intention of the In&s;titutors wou'd have been defeated, had private Per&s;ons been &s;uffer'd to teach on a different Plan, and draw off the Youth by their Intere&s;t with particular Families, Sects and Parties; or, which is oftner the Ca&s;e by a mean Attention to the Foibles and Weakne&s;s of Parents. In this Ca&s;e, we &s;hou'd never have beheld &s;uch a divine Sight as all the <HI>Miranian</HI>-Youth a&s;&s;embled, as before &s;aid, in <HI>One School of Virtue,</HI> fir'd with the noble Emulation of di&s;tingui&s;h|ing them&s;elves by all that is Good, in the Eye of the Public. We &s;hou'd never have &s;een that Mixture of People, of which <HI>Mirania</HI> con&s;i&s;ts, coale&s;c'd in the ri|&s;ing Generation. As, therefore, it is the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Go|vernment to &s;ee that Youth, who are the Property of the State, &s;hou'd be educated according to the Intention of the State, they thought it incumbent on Them to take Care, that Nothing &s;hou'd retard the Execution of that Plan for which they had toil'd &s;o much, and re|&s;olv'd to be at &s;o much Expence. Tho&s;e, they thought, who cou'd be Enemies to &s;uch a generous Undertaking, and wou'd not avail Them&s;elves of &s;uch an In&s;titution, were certainly Enemies to the Well-Being of their Country; and, as &s;uch, ought to be depriv'd of every other Means of public In&s;truction. Tho' this Precaution was commen|dable, and &s;eem'd ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the Succe&s;s of the Underaking; yet the Con&s;equence and Di&s;po&s;ition of the People, render'd it needle&s;s.&mdash;In a &s;hort Time, there was &s;carce a Per&s;on &s;o blind, as not to &s;ee how far &s;uch a public In&s;titution mu&s;t be &s;uperior to any other Education, and to prefer it accordingly. They &s;aw, Nothing was propos'd but to train up their Children to
<PB N="68" REF="007121_0067_102AF9D3ACC84778"><HI>Science</HI> and <HI>natural Goodne&s;s;</HI> and to keep them free of all Prejudices, with Relation to idle Di&s;putes, Di&s;tinc|tions, and Opinions, till a liberal Education and ripe Judgment, &s;hou'd make them capable of thinking for them&s;elves.&mdash;Such an Education, &s;ay they, is what we owe to our Children; to educate them otherwi&s;e, is an unju&s;t Impo&s;ition on their rea&s;onable Faculties&mdash;What cou'd we wi&s;h more?

A Profe&s;&s;or of Greek was cho&s;en in his &s;tead to teach the Greek Cla&s;s, which was fill'd up with the highe&s;t Cla&s;s from the Latin-School; and &s;ome Youth from the Country.&mdash;This Year the Number of Scholars required one U&s;her to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Ma&s;ter of the Latin-School; and two to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Ma&s;ter of the Mechanic's School. Thus four new Ma&s;ters were added, and the Gentlemen-Sub&s;cribers a&s;&s;e&s;s'd propor|tionably.</P>
<P N="3">3d Year. <HI>Aratus</HI> advanc'd with his Scholars to the third Cla&s;s. A Profe&s;&s;or of Mathematics was cho&s;en to &s;upply his Place in the &s;econd Cla&s;s, which was now fill'd up by tho&s;e that had been in the Greek Cla&s;s the fore|going Year; the highe&s;t Cla&s;s in the Latin School being advanc'd into the Greek Cla&s;s as before.</P>
<P N="4">4th Year. He advanc'd with his Scholars into the fourth Cla&s;s. A Profe&s;&s;or of Philo&s;ophy was cho&s;en to &s;upply his Room in the third Cla&s;s, which was fill'd up by advancing all the inferior Cla&s;&s;es as before.</P>
<P N="5">5th Year. <HI>Aratus</HI> open'd the Fifth, or highe&s;t Cla&s;s. A Profe&s;&s;or of Rhetoric and Poetry was cho&s;en for the fourth Cla&s;s, which was fill'd up by the Youth that had made the third Cla&s;s the former Year; all the inferior Cla&s;&s;es being advanced one Cla&s;s higher as u&s;ual. Thus, the fifth Year, the Seminary was brought to that State in which I have above de&s;cribed it; all the Cla&s;&s;es being full.&mdash;</P>

During the&s;e five Years, the Tru&s;tees had been car|rying on the Edifice according to the Plan laid down; which they had been enabled to do by an yearly Lottery. But as they &s;aw that a great Sum would be wanting be|&s;ides what might remain of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Lotteries, after the Erection of the Buildings; they empower'd certain Gen|tlemen to &s;ollicit and manage a Scheme of a Lottery for them in <HI>London,</HI> in order to rai&s;e &pound;. 8000 Sterling to be added to their own Funds for compleating the Reve|nues of the College. The&s;e Gentlemen having previ|ou&s;ly publi&s;hed the whole Plan of the <HI>Miranian</HI> In&s;titu|tion, the generous De&s;ign of it was &s;o much approv'd and countenanc'd by the pious and learned of all Deno|minations in that great City, that the Managers no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oner advertis'd the Scheme of a Lottery to enable the <HI>Miranians</HI> to carry their Project into Execution, than all the Tickets were &s;old. And tho' it was propos'd to rai&s;e only eight Thou&s;and Pounds, yet as a great many of the &s;maller Prizes were generou&s;ly given to the Managers for the U&s;e of the College, about &pound;. 12000 Ster. came clear to the <HI>Miranians.</HI> A famous Bi&s;hop al&s;o gave a large Sum to be laid out in purcha&s;ing a Library; and a Layman, a great Promoter of natural Knowlege, complimented them, at his Death, with his whole mathematical and philo&s;ophical Apparatus. Thus at the Conclu&s;ion of the 5th Year, my Countrymen, by a Concurrence of happy Circum&s;tances, found their Edifice fini&s;h'd, and them&s;elves enabled to endow it in a Manner far &s;uperior to their warme&s;t Hopes.&mdash;Then it was that the fifth Cla&s;s, of which I was one, com|menc'd

On this Occa&s;ion the new Edifice was open'd with prodigious Eclat. The Orations and Ceremony of Commencement were held in the Chapel; after this a magnificent Entertainment was
<PB N="71" REF="007121_0070_102AF9DB4F61A710">&s;erv'd up in the public Hall; and in the Evening, we who had commenc'd Ma&s;ters of Arts, entertain'd the Company with the Tragedy of <HI>Cato.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>The Day following, all the Cla&s;&s;es in the Seminary were publickly examined: That which was the 4th now becoming the 5th, in Lieu of tho&s;e who had proceeded Ma&s;ter of Arts; and all the lower Cla&s;&s;es being ad|vanc'd one Cla&s;s higher, to the lowe&s;t in the Latin-School, which being thus left empty, was fill'd up from the Engli&s;h Cla&s;&s;es in the Mechanic's School, by &s;uch of the Youth as were de&s;ign'd for the learn'd Profe&s;&s;i|ons. It was further appointed that this Cu&s;tom &s;hould be ob&s;erv'd yearly, on the Day after the Commence|ment; and that for the more Regularity in the Cla&s;&s;es of the Latin-School, upon which depends the Regularity of the Re&s;t, it was appointed that no Boys &s;hould, for the future, be admitted into it but once each Year, and that always on the &s;aid Day. There is no Inconveni|ency in this Method; becau&s;e every Per&s;on, being ap|priz'd of it, can take his Mea&s;ures accordingly.&mdash;</P>
<P>It was now at la&s;t, continued <HI>Evander,</HI> that the <HI>Mi|ranians,</HI> encourag'd by their Succe&s;s in this great Un|dertaking, propos'd to render it &s;till more exten&s;ive, by erecting Schools throughout the Province. You may be ready to imagine this &s;hou'd have been the fir&s;t Step, in order to &s;upply the College with Students. But they con&s;ider'd, that it would be impo&s;&s;ible to find pro|per Ma&s;ters for the&s;e Country Schools, unle&s;s they fir&s;t bred them at their own College; by which Means one uniform Scheme of Education might be carried on in every Part of the Province.&mdash;</P>
<P>In every Town&s;hip, they erected an Engli&s;h School; and one Latin School in the mo&s;t convenient Town of each County. As Ma&s;ters to the Engli&s;h Schools, they &s;ent young Men of Genius that had been educated gratis in the Mechanic's School. To the Latin-Schools, in the &s;everal Counties, they &s;ent fit Per&s;ons, chiefly educated gratis in the Latin School and learned Cla&s;&s;es

<P>This is all that need be done in the Province for the Education of Youth at pre&s;ent. And it redounds greatly to the Glory of the Projectors, that little more need be done for many Generations. The College and the two Schools, if quite full, are capable of educating thirty Boys in each Cla&s;s, (570 in the whole) and of &s;ending abroad yearly 30 well tutor'd Mechanics, and the &s;ame Number of Gentlemen for the learn'd Pro|fe&s;&s;ions and the Offices of the State. How many more are educated at the Country Schools I cannot a&s;certain. The whole annual Expence of this In&s;titution, for Sala|ries to the Ma&s;ters, is but &pound;. 1200 <HI>Miranian</HI> Currency: Cou'd it be po&s;&s;ible to educate &s;uch a Number of Youth with &s;o little Expence by any other Method? Before the public E&s;tabli&s;hment of it, the Education of Youth (if it then might be call'd Education) co&s;t the Province, and perhaps the City, a Sum equal to this: There was at lea&s;t as much more drawn out of the Province for the Want of &s;uch an In&s;titution; and if we take into the Con&s;ideration, that there is more than the Revenue of the College brought into the Province from other Coun|tries that prefer it to any other Seminary; and la&s;tly, that the Capital of this &pound;. 1200 was for the mo&s;t Part rais'd in <HI>England;</HI> it will appear how much we are Gainers by &s;uch an In&s;titution even in Money Matters. What we have gain'd, and &s;till hope to gain, in other Re&s;pects, I have partly taken Notice of in the Cour&s;e of this Nar|rative; and &s;hall only add that &s;ome of our Country-Men, who have return'd, after being ab&s;ent for the

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>This is the Account, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> my Friend gave of the Seminary of <HI>Mirania.</HI> How far it may be &s;till im|prov'd, and imitated by us, is entirely &s;ubmitted to your Wi&s;dom. It is no romantic Scheme, but &s;uch as I am certain may be ea&s;ily put in Execution. Nothing that I can think of can be more &s;imple, if the Exten&s;ivene&s;s of the Scheme is con&s;ider'd. It is al&s;o well adapted, I conceive, to our Circum&s;tances: And as I have already &s;aid that <HI>Mirania</HI> was &s;uch as this Province is now, when its College was opened twelve Years ago; &s;o it is not unrea&s;onable to add, that by following, and perhaps im|proving, their Plan, we may, twelve Years hence, be all that <HI>Mirania</HI> is now repre&s;ented to be. The Mechanic's School is an In&s;titution as nece&s;&s;ary, in this trading Country, as in <HI>Mirania.</HI> To the Latin School, and the five learned Cla&s;&s;es, there can be no Objection. Ten Years is the lea&s;t Time that can be allow'd for fini&s;hing the Studies laid down above for tho&s;e intended for the learned Profe&s;&s;ions. A Cla&s;s for each Year is the Stan|dard generally agreed upon, unle&s;s where the Numbers of Scholars render more nece&s;&s;ary: But this is the greate&s;t Interval that can conveniently be between the Cla&s;&s;es; con|&s;equently the Number of Cla&s;&s;es, in the foregoing Scheme, cannot be reduc'd. But as the&s;e Cla&s;&s;es may perhaps be
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is not probable however, that the Cla&s;&s;es will be thin at fir&s;t: For, even in the &s;mall Part of the Province, I have had an Oppor|tunity of knowing, there are above a Dozen young Gentlemen fit at pre&s;ent to be entered into the Greek Cla&s;s, which is the highe&s;t that can be open'd in the College at fir&s;t: Now &s;uppo&s;e there were no more for this Cla&s;s, and nearly the &s;ame Number for the lower Cla&s;&s;es in the Latin School;&mdash;has there ever been a College open'd at fir&s;t in this Part of the World under greater Advantages, or with &s;uch a Number of Youth?</NOTE> thin at fir&s;t, we can do what is equivalent
<PB N="74" REF="007121_0073_102AF9E2E186AFF8">to a Diminution of their Number; I mean, to appoint but one In&s;tructor for two or three Cla&s;&s;es: And when the Numbers of Students &s;hall render more In&s;tructors nece&s;&s;ary, our Abilities to employ more mu&s;t be pro|portionably greater; for to me it &s;eems incon&s;i&s;tent to &s;ay a thriving Country cannot always &s;ub&s;i&s;t a Number of In&s;tructors proportion'd to the encrea&s;ing Numbers of its Youth.</P>
<P>In this Province one Ma&s;ter and two A&s;&s;i&s;tants may for many Years be &s;ufficient for the Mechanic's School: A Ma&s;ter and one A&s;&s;i&s;tant for the Latin-School: And the Head of the Seminary with two A&s;&s;i&s;tants for the five learned Cla&s;&s;es. But for the two or three fir&s;t Years even one half of this Number may be enough. Now, as no other School will be wanted in the City, is the Expence of employing this Number of In&s;tructors for the whole Youth of the City, and as many as &s;hall be &s;ent from the Country, too much for this Province without any foreign A&s;&s;i&s;tance? Let tho&s;e, who think it is, enquire whether the Education of Youth does not, at this very Day, co&s;t the Province more within and
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">How much this Province lo&s;es at pre&s;ent, by &s;ending their Youth to be educated in other Places, &s;eems but too little attended to. Se|veral of tho&s;e I have mention'd as fit for the Greek Cla&s;s, among whom are the young Gentlemen at pre&s;ent under my Care, are pre|paring to leave the Province in a few Weeks, for Want of &s;ome collegiate Institution. It &s;eems &s;till le&s;s con&s;idered how much Money might be brought into the Country from the We&s;t-Indies, if we had a College model'd in &s;ome &s;uch manly Manner as that propo&s;ed above. I am certainly inform'd by Gentlemen that have an Intere&s;t in the We&s;t-Indies, that we might expect very great A&s;&s;i&s;tance from the&s;e I&s;lands, wou'd we only &s;hew them that we have &s;ome good In&s;titu|tion in View, and have made a Law for carrying it &s;peedily and properly into Execution. There are many Rea&s;ons that induce the People of the&s;e Countries to give the Preference to this Province; particularly the Healthfulne&s;s of the Climate, our Situation, Simila|rity of Manners, and &s;ome others I &s;hall not mention; which wou'd al&s;o induce the Mother Country to patronize and encourage &s;uch an In&s;titution among us. Happy for us, did we know as well as &s;ome of our Neighbours to make a right Improvement of the &s;uperior Advantages, with which Nature and Fortune have favor'd us. This I do not mention to create mean Jealou&s;ies between neighbouring Provinces, but to awaken and animate that generous Emulation, by which it will ever be the Intere&s;t of all of them to be actuated.</NOTE> without it&s;elf, than it would co&s;t us by the E&s;tabli&s;h|ment
<PB N="75" REF="007121_0074_102AF9E4697E5C38">propos'd. But if we are really unable to carry &s;uch a Scheme into Execution, yet &s;till let us begin it: There is no Danger &s;uch a noble Undertaking &s;hould fail of Succe&s;s. Why may we not expect the &s;ame good Fortune which the <HI>Miranians</HI> had in an Engli&s;h Lottery? If we &s;hou'd be di&s;appointed in our Expectations from every Quarter; yet &s;till it will be glorious to have at|tempted an exten&s;ive and great Work. As we are about the E&s;tabli&s;hment of a Seminary, we &s;hou'd have an exten&s;ive and univer&s;al In&s;titution, &s;uch as is laid down above, always in our Eye. If we cannot do the Whole, in the foremention'd Space of Time, let us begin to do what is mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary; and do it in &s;uch a Manner, that our Po&s;terity &s;hall have nothing to do but fini&s;h, in an uniform Manner, the Scheme at fir&s;t projected.</P>
<P>With Regard to the Edifice; what is call'd, in the foregoing Plan, the Second or <HI>Ea&s;t Building,</HI> might ac|commodate all the Cla&s;&s;es of a College in this Province for &s;ome Time. The Re&s;t of the Buildings of the Square may be added as Occa&s;ion &s;erves&mdash;</P>
<P>A &s;ingle Province has a va&s;t Advantage, in the Exe|cution of a Scheme of this Nature, above an exten&s;ive Monarchy. In large and populous Countries, Educa|tion cannot be immediately the Care of the Legi&s;lature; they can only enact good Laws for Education, and de|volve the Execution of them upon fit Per&s;ons, in every particular Seminary: But in a &s;ingle Province, where all the Youth may be collected into one general Semina|ry, the Legi&s;lature, or tho&s;e commi&s;&s;ion'd by them, may, and &s;hould, be the immediate Superintendants of Education; than which nothing can be more worthy their Care. The Practice of ancient States, in this re|&s;pect, is truly &s;urprizing and worthy our Regard. In their Infancy they did not bu&s;y them&s;elves &s;o much in
<PB N="76" REF="007121_0075_102AF9E5F87BBB68">making Laws for the Puni&s;hment of Criminals, as for hindering there being any Criminals among them, by &s;topping up the great Inlets of Vice, and training up Youth to be, as it were, con&s;titutionally Good. Hence a mighty Republic &s;ub&s;i&s;ted many Generations without a Law to puni&s;h <HI>Parricide;</HI> becau&s;e, as the fir&s;t Legi&s;|lators wi&s;ely fore&s;aw, no Per&s;on would be guilty of &s;uch a Crime, while the Laws for educating Youth in the ju&s;t Reverence of Magi&s;trates, Parents and all Superiors remain'd in full Force. Hence it was that the Infancy of States generally exhibited all tho&s;e bright Models of Virtue mention'd above; who&s;e happy Effects had taken &s;uch deep Root as to &s;upport them for &s;ome Time after all <HI>real Virtue</HI> was expired among them. We &s;hould always keep tho&s;e Ages of Simplicity in our View, and form our Conduct upon the bright Patterns they pre&s;ent us with; remembring always, that as this is our Infant-Condition, we mu&s;t follow tho&s;e Patterns, would we tran&s;mit to our Po&s;terity, a healthful and thriving State.</P>
<P>Hence it appears how nece&s;&s;ary it is to give <HI>Hi&s;tory, Agriculture</HI> and <HI>Religion,</HI> the chief Place in a Plan of Education calculated for an Infant-Country. It is Hi&s;tory that, by pre&s;enting tho&s;e bright Patterns to the Eyes of Youth, awakens Emulation, and calls them forth &s;teady Patriots to fill the Offices of the State. It is not by forming them mere Scholars the State can be|come flouri&s;hing; but by forming them Patriots, and putting them in the Method of becoming Politicians and good Lawgivers. 'Tis but a few that have either Lei|&s;ure or Genius to be benefited by the Labors of a mere learn'd Man; but a whole Country, may be made hap|py by the &s;ucce&s;sful Toils of the Patriot; and happy not for one, but many Generations. Tho&s;e that are educa|ted to be true Patriots, are like &s;o many <HI>Suns</HI> in Society. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a larger Share of etherial Spirit, they infu&s;e Life, Spirit and Joy into all around them.</P>
<P>'Tis &s;hameful for any Man to be entirely ignorant of what happen'd in the World before he was born; but
<PB N="77" REF="007121_0076_102AF9E8E1080248">for a Man to be call'd to the Service of his Country, or to worm him&s;elf into high Offices, and even the Councils of his Prince, not only without knowing the Cau&s;es a&s;&s;igned for the Ri&s;e, Glory and Fall of the chief Nations of the World, but even without knowing the Hi&s;tory and Con&s;titution of his own Country, it is not only &s;hameful, but the blacke&s;t Treachery; and wor&s;e, methinks, than an open Con&s;piracy again&s;t his Prince and Country.</P>
<P>The Advantages of training up &s;kilful Hu&s;bandmen, are &s;o manife&s;tly great to us, as an Infant-Colony &s;ettled in the mo&s;t fertil Soil, that it is needle&s;s to in&s;i&s;t on them. Did Gentlemen of Di&s;tinction under&s;tand the rational Part of Hu&s;bandry, as they mu&s;t by this Scheme, and &s;et the Example to the Countrymen around them; were there &s;ome proper Laws made for encouraging an Ac|ce&s;&s;ion of Hands, and better &s;ettling this Province, it might be made the <HI>Granary</HI> of half the European Set|tlements in <HI>America.</HI>&mdash;Who, that con&s;iders this, but mu&s;t be &s;urprized at the general Complaint, that this Country mu&s;t be ruin'd unle&s;s a new War happens &s;oon? Good Heaven! It is tho&s;e very Riches acquir'd in Time of War that impoveri&s;h us, and mu&s;t in the I&s;&s;ue prove our Ruin if not prevented by proper Mea&s;ures. In Time of War Riches pour in upon us all at once, and &s;eem even to deluge our Streets: This turns our Atten|tion from the Improvement of our &s;lower, but &s;urer, natural Wealth; introduces Luxury; multiplies our Wants; and turns the Balance of Trade again&s;t us with the Mother-Country, which in a Moment drains us of all our Money, and leaves us dependent on the Chance of War for a fre&s;h Recruit. What a precarious Situa|tion is this? Whereas, let us &s;et our our&s;elves to im|prove our Manufactures, and chiefly to call forth, from the teeming Womb of a grateful Soil of Earth, that luxuriant Wealth it is capable to produce, then have we in our Power an unprecarious Source of never-failing Plenty. In that Ca&s;e the Balance of Trade can never be again&s;t us. In the longe&s;t Peace we cannot be poor;
<PB N="78" REF="007121_0077_102AF9EC0C1C0190">and in War, the Returns of our Bravery, in Defence of the true <HI>Briti&s;h Cau&s;e, Religion, Liberty</HI> and <HI>Commerce,</HI> mu&s;t infallibly make us rich! We &s;hall then no more, like the Waggoneer in the Fable, be &s;een idly praying <HI>Jupiter</HI> to do that for us, which, by applying our Shoulders to the Wheel, we may do for our&s;elves.</P>
<P>As for the Study of <HI>Religion,</HI> in the above Scheme, it is the Soul of the Whole. It teaches us not only to enjoy aright what Science, Hi&s;tory and Agriculture enable us to acquire in Life; but con&s;ecrates us for Eter|nity, and makes this Life, what it &s;hould be, an Intro|duction to all the future Stages of the Con&s;ummation of our Virtue and Happine&s;s!&mdash;</P>
<P>All I have to add, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> is to beg your kind Acceptance, and candid Peru&s;al of this Work; remem|bring always that it comes from a &s;ingle Per&s;on, of &s;mall Experience, una&s;&s;i&s;ted with proper Books, and at a Di&s;tance from the Conver&s;ation of &s;ome of you, who&s;e Sentiments I &s;hould otherwi&s;e have often taken the Free|dom to enquire into, relating to many Parts of it. Con&s;cious of the&s;e Di&s;advantages, I &s;hou'd never have attempted &s;uch a tedious and difficult Work, had I not &s;een it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and been apprehen&s;ive that no other Per&s;on wou'd be&s;tow their Lei&s;ure upon it. As to the Faults that may be found in it, I &s;hall never be a&s;ham'd of them, becau&s;e none but a Per&s;on that has an univer&s;al Knowledge of all the Branches of Science treated of, which I do not pretend to, cou'd avoid Faults. Whoever looks for a perfect Scheme, looks for what the Author never dream'd of, in a Work that might employ all the learn'd Men of the Province, and &s;till leave Room to find Faults and propo&s;e Improvements. &mdash;You, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> who&s;e &s;uperior Stations and Abilities have recommended you as the Fir&s;t and more immediate Patrons of this great Work, will not, I hope, think the rude&s;t Hints below your Notice; &s;ince even from the&s;e you are capable to reap Advantage. My very Errors may be render'd u&s;eful; &s;ince tho&s;e who can be&s;t di&s;co|ver
<PB N="79" REF="007121_0078_102AF9EDC4D71708">will be lea&s;t liable to fall into, them. I &s;hall not be &s;orry to &s;ee the foregoing Scheme &s;et wholly a&s;ide, if Per&s;ons of more Abilities can thereby be excited to plan a Better. Would every Per&s;on offer his Sentiments with the &s;ame Frankne&s;s that I have offer'd mine; a good Scheme might certainly be extracted from the Whole. Shou'd this Scheme of <HI>Mirania</HI> de&s;erve any Notice, no Per&s;on &s;hall be more ready than I to ac|knowlege what is deficient in it; and a&s;&s;i&s;t in improving what is commendable, when I am enabled &s;o to do by the Ob&s;ervations of tho&s;e who &s;incerely wi&s;h Pro&s;perity to this Undertaking. As for tho&s;e Writers who delight to give frequent Specimens of their Knack at Wrangling and Chicane; or who are determin'd to think Nothing right in this Affair, but what comes from them&s;elves, my Time is too precious to follow them thro' the Maze of Perplexity. They may, if they plea&s;e, a&s;cribe every Thing I have done to a &s;elfi&s;h Motive; I &s;hall leave it to Time and the I&s;&s;ue of the Thing to convince them how much they have injur'd me. It will then be &s;ufficient Puni&s;hment for them to reflect on their U&s;age of One who never offended them, but by a Zeal for the Happine&s;s of that Province, which they ought to love more, than one, who is a Stranger in it. There was no other Way I cou'd manife&s;t that Zeal but on the Subject of Education, as all the Time I have liv'd in the World has been &s;pent in my own Education and that of others. As this Sub|ject then happens to be very intere&s;ting to this Province at pre&s;ent, I &s;hou'd never have forgiven My&s;elf, had I neglected the &s;ole Opportunity I can ever have of being in the lea&s;t Degree u&s;eful to it.&mdash;Sorry &s;hou'd I be, however, if, after all my Partiality in treating this Mat|ter, I &s;hou'd fall under the Di&s;plea&s;ure of any Sect or Party, who may claim an exclu&s;ive Right of modeling this In&s;titution to their Mind. Every Per&s;on is at Li|berty, and I think ought, to offer his Sentiments. You, Gentlemen, and the Legi&s;lature are the only proper Judges of the Whole; and I make no Doubt you will,
<PB N="80" REF="007121_0079_102AD6EB4D1040E8">prefer that Scheme which you think be&s;t calculated to promote the Peace and Happine&s;s of the Province with|out regarding the Heats and Di&s;putes that may ari&s;e at fir&s;t on this Head; or be &s;tarted on purpo&s;e, to retard the Execution of a Work, far too long delay'd already.</P>
<P>But, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> I will not embara&s;s You, nor my|&s;elf, at the End of a Work of this Nature, by de&s;cen|ding farther into Particulars: Neither &s;hall I once ad|dre&s;s You to exert your&s;elves in this great Undertaking, for the &s;ame Rea&s;on that I did not once addre&s;s You, nor an honorable Branch of the Legi&s;lature on a former Occa&s;ion. If You con&s;ider my De&s;ign at that Time, &s;uch an Addre&s;s as forc'd and foreign to it, wou'd have been Cen&s;ure. My Bu&s;ine&s;s, then, was with tho&s;e who are the <HI>Ma&s;ters of the Pur&s;e,</HI> and the chief Projectors of new Laws. This I &s;hou'd never have mention'd in this Place, as being &s;en&s;ible that no Addre&s;s of mine can be of Importance enough to give or dimini&s;h Fame, had it not been made a Handle of, for want of a better, to create Jealou&s;ies and Di&s;tru&s;ts.&mdash;</P>
<P>An Apology for the Method of conveying the fore|going Propo&s;als wou'd, I hope, be needle&s;s to tho&s;e who con&s;ider the Dryne&s;s of the Subject. When hand|ling the Article of Religion, I de&s;ignedly &s;catter'd a few Flowers, that I might help to remove the vulgar Preju|dice; and &s;hew that, by proper Conduct, this might be made the mo&s;t agreeable and amu&s;ing Part of Educa|tion. What I have &s;aid on this Subject &s;tands as it flow'd at fir&s;t upon my Thoughts; which has made &s;ome of the Periods perhaps too long. But this I cou'd not help, unle&s;s I cou'd have &s;par'd Time to divide &s;uch Periods, and add &s;omething for Connexion; which wou'd, however, have made the particular Paragraphs much longer. The Ver&s;es prefix'd, are part of an unfini&s;h'd <HI>Pa&s;toral</HI> in Imitation of <HI>Virgil</HI>'s <HI>Silenus,</HI> entitled <HI>Science,</HI> and therefore a-kin to my Subject.&mdash;</P>
<P>To conclude, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> I have &s;par'd no Pains, and left none of the few Books, I have on Education,
<PB N="81" REF="007121_0080_102AF9F3AEB9E618">uncon&s;ulted: that I might render it u&s;eful, it being the la&s;t Service I am capable of offering to promote this great Undertaking. All I can do more, is to pray GOD that the Succe&s;s may be an&s;werable.&mdash;Under GOD, it greatly depends on You to make it &s;o: And no one can doubt, but you will zealou&s;ly exert your&s;elves for this Purpo&s;e, who reflects, that whatever Degree of Glory this Province &s;hall acquire from &s;uch an In&s;titution, your immediate De&s;cendents will reap the chief Advantage of it, &s;ince the large Share of Property you will leave them po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of, mu&s;t make them nearly concern'd in the Intere&s;t of the Province; and point them out for the chief Offices of the Government, which you now de&s;er|vedly fill.&mdash;</P>

<P>LAST Lo&s;t, after mo&s;t of the foregoing Sheets were printed off, I had the Honor to receive, by the Way of <HI>Philadel|phia,</HI> a Letter from a Gentleman of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd for his Rank and Fortune, but more &s;o, in the learn'd World, as a Patriot Writer. It came in Return to one &s;ent Him with my former Pamphlet, in <HI>November</HI> la&s;t; and as it contains &s;ome new Arguments for fixing the College in our Metropolis, which did not occur to me, and al&s;o confirms in the &s;tronge&s;t Manner what I have hinted in the

Some, I am well aware, will mi&s;con&s;true what I do into Vanity. Be it &s;o; 'tis a Vanity the mo&s;t commendable of all others; and &s;uch as the Latin-Philo&s;opher has taught me not to di&s;own. <HI>Contemptu Famae, Virtus contemnitur.</HI>&mdash;But to return to the Let|ter, my learn'd Corre&s;pondent writes thus;</P>
<Q><P>&mdash;Your Thoughts on Education are very ju&s;t, and your Arguments in Favor of e&s;tabli&s;hing of a College rather in the City of <HI>New-York</HI> than el&s;ewhere are convincing: But I wi&s;h you had been more copious on the latter Subject, and much more explicit and preci&s;e on the former. I wi&s;h you had fully de&s;crib'd the Plan of <HI>Gla&s;gow-College,</HI> as improv'd by that great Philo&s;opher, Mr. <HI>Hutchin&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> together with your own, or other People's Improvements upon the proper Di&s;cipline of a College, which, perhaps, is the mo&s;t material Part of &s;uch a Plan; as it is the only &s;trong Barrier again&s;t the Admi&s;&s;ion of Vice: For, I conceive, by proper Di&s;cipline, the Vices of a populous City, might be excluded from a College built in the very Suburbs; from whence the Youth might be per|mitted, twice a Week, at &s;ea&s;onable Hours, to vi&s;it Coffee-Hou&s;es, the Exchange, and all the Re&s;orts of Bu&s;ine&s;s, except Taverns. Thus their Minds might be form'd to what the French call <HI>Police;</HI> as al&s;o to Comme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce, and to a &s;trict Ob&s;ervation of Mechanic Arts, which are the main Springs of Commerce. For want of Skill in tho&s;e Points of greate&s;t Importance to our Mother-Country it is, that Trade is &s;o little under&s;tood by our Members of Parliament, and &s;o much neglected at this very Time, when all other Nations are trying every Art to extend their Commerce. Is not this Ig|norance of our learn'd Men imputable chiefly to the Situa|tion of our Univer&s;ities, &s;o remote from every Theatre of Action, and of real and u&s;eful Life? And to what is the aukward Ru&s;ticity of our Book-Worms to be a&s;crib'd, but to an ab&s;olute Rece&s;s from all <HI>practical Politene&s;s?</HI></P>
<P>I wi&s;h al&s;o you had carry'd your Argument one Step farther, and hinted to the Legi&s;lature that a

I have heard it &s;aid, that we have no Rea&s;on to expect the <HI>We&s;t-Indians</HI> wou'd &s;end their Children here, as they have been long accu&s;tom'd to &s;end them to <HI>England:</HI> But they who &s;ay &s;o, know little what our Engli&s;h Univer&s;ities are at pre&s;ent: For, to u&s;e the Words of the Authors of the <HI>Revie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> for <HI>November,</HI> 1750,&mdash;
<Q>That even both our Univer&s;ities (not forgetting that in the Metropo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is of a neighbouring Kingdom) are render'd of little U&s;e to the Public, or to the Welfare of Religion, by the idle Doctrines and corrupt Manners which prevail in them, is a Truth equally notorious and melancholy: and any effectual Scheme for a thoro' Reformation, or (if this is impo&s;&s;ible, thro' the Perver&s;ene&s;s of their Members) a <HI>total A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lition</HI> of them, wou'd merit the Attention of every Lover of his Country, every Well-wi&s;her to true Chri&s;tianity, and to civil and religious Liberty.</Q>&mdash;Be&s;ides this, the Ri&s;que and Expence of &s;ending Children from the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> to this Place, are not &s;o great as to &s;end them to <HI>England.</HI> It is not to be que&s;tion'd then, but the&s;e young I&s;landers, as my Corre|&s;pondent hints, wou'd infallibly come for their Education to the&s;e Provinces, and that of <HI>New-York</HI> above all others, wou'd we go into &s;ome &s;uch generous and liberal In&s;titution as that propos'd above. And what a noble Pro&s;pect of Wealth and Glory does this open to <HI>Us,</HI> unle&s;s we will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ar the Whole by &s;ome unprecedented religious E&s;tabli&s;hment, that may be di&s;agreeable to the Per&s;ua&s;ion of the&s;e I&s;landers? I always fore&s;aw the Di&s;putes that would ari&s;e on this Head, and there|fore, in the foregoing Work &s;teer'd quite clear of every Thing that might kindle them among a People that, till a few Months ago, &s;eem'd remarkable for that Chri&s;tian Peace and Charity which reign'd among all religious Sects in the Province. But as the&s;e Di&s;putes have now taken their Ri&s;e from another Quarter, I &s;hould as freely give my Sentiments on them, as I have on every other Point relating to our intended Seminary, did not the <HI>Printer</HI> wait for this <HI>Po&s;t&s;cript,</HI> to enable him to perform his Promi&s;e of publi&s;hing the&s;e Papers to-morrow.&mdash; Tho' I have every where given it as my Opinion that, in a

In this E&s;tabli&s;hment then, the Preference mu&s;t be given to &s;ome one of the Modes of Wor&s;hip, or let me call them Churches, &s;ub|fi&s;ting at pre&s;ent; unle&s;s we delay the Founding a College for twenty, perhaps a hundred, Years more, till all Sides can agree to patch up &s;ome new &s;ort of religious Wor&s;hip for it, out of all tho&s;e we have at pre&s;ent; which, however &s;trange it ap|pears, &s;eems to be contended for. That &s;uch a Preference will be productive of none of tho&s;e dreadful Con&s;equences denounc'd again&s;t it, might ea&s;ily be made manife&s;t.
