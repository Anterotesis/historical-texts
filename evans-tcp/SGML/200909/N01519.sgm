<P>_IN this <HI>Chapter</HI> we have the la&s;t Publick Appearance of <HI>Solomon</HI> in all his <HI>Glory;</HI> His <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> yet remaining with him. He is vi&s;i|ted here and admir'd by the Renowned <HI>Queen of Sheba.</HI> She had heard the fame of his Great <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> as well as of his Magnificence and Great <HI>Build|ings;</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="001805_0003_0FB842BBECA707C0">but more the fame of his <HI>Religion,</HI> and <HI>concerning the Name of the LORD</HI> who&s;e Hou&s;e he had built; and &s;he came to be In&s;tructed by him, both in matters of <HI>Government</HI> and the <HI>Wor&s;hip</HI> of the true God. She came with a Great <HI>Equipage</HI> and very Princely <HI>Retinue.</HI> "She came to <HI>trade for Wi&s;dom,</HI> to purcha&s;e it at any Rate, with very much <HI>Gold and precious Stones,</HI> which yet were not to be <HI>weigh'd</HI> with Wi&s;dom. She appear'd even a <HI>Rival to Solomon</HI> in Riches and Magnificence, Genero&s;ity &amp; <HI>Largene&s;s of heart.</HI> She came with Great <HI>Expectations,</HI> rais'd by the <HI>Reports</HI> &s;he had heard in her own Land, but owns the <HI>one half</HI> had not been told her. When &s;he had &s;een <HI>all his Wi&s;dom, and the Hou&s;e that he had built, and the meat of his Table, and the &s;itting of his Servants, and the Attendance of his Mi|ni&s;ters, and their Apparel, and his Cup-bearers, and his A&s;cent by which he went up into the Hou&s;e of the LORD,</HI> (and I &s;uppo&s;e with what Gra|vity and Seriou&s;ne&s;s, true Maje&s;ty, Humility and Devotion this <HI>Great Prince</HI> was won't to wor&s;hip) <HI>there remained no more any Spirit in Her.</HI> She <HI>ble&s;s'd</HI> his very <HI>Servants,</HI> and was ready to envy them, and wi&s;h her &s;elf in their place. <HI>Happy are thy Men, happy are the&s;e thy Servants, which &s;tand continually before thee, and hear thy Wi&s;dom.</HI> "Finally, She <HI>ble&s;&s;es</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="001805_0004_0FB842BD6A56E9B8" MS="y"><HI>GOD</HI> the Giver of <HI>Solomons</HI> Wi&s;dom, Wealth and Grandeur, and the Author of his Ad|vancement; <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord thy GOD which delighted in thee, to &s;et Thee on the Throne of I&s;rael; becau&s;e the LORD loved I&s;rael for ever, therefore made He Thee King, to do Judgment and Ju&s;tice.</HI></P>
<P>THUS &s;he turns all her Amiration and Delight into <HI>an Act of Religious Thanksgiving</HI> to GOD. Something is &s;aid of <HI>Solomon,</HI> but more of <HI>God,</HI> by whom he reigned. <HI>He</HI> was made <HI>King,</HI> and &s;et on the throne of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> to do Judgment and Ju&s;tice. But it was GOD that made him King, and who advanc'd him to the Throne, partly in kindne&s;s to <HI>Him,</HI> becau&s;e that he delighted in him; but more in kindne&s;s to his <HI>People,</HI> becau&s;e the Lord loved I&s;rael for Ever.</P>
<P>MIND the <HI>Decency</HI> and <HI>Devotion</HI> of this wi&s;e and <HI>Princely Speech:</HI> which tho' it was the mo&s;t honourable to <HI>Solomon</HI> that cou'd be, yet was void of <HI>Flattery.</HI> Flattery&mdash;, No, <HI>Solomon</HI>'s State and Wi&s;dom were too Great to allow it, and <HI>Her</HI> Noble Heart and Ma|je&s;ty, as well as Di&s;cretion, too High to give it. Her Words are Grave and Solemn, and did in excellent manner <HI>admoni&s;h Solomon,</HI> that he receiv'd his Crown <HI>from</HI> God; that he was to reign <HI>for</HI> Him; <HI>to</HI> be <HI>Ju&s;t,</HI> ruling
<PB N="6" REF="001805_0005_0FB842C3689C06D0">in his fear; that it was from the Unde&s;er|ved <HI>Love</HI> and Good Will of God towards him that he was Accompli&s;ht for and Exal|ted to the Throne from among his Brethren; that what God had done for him was done in favour to <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and from his <HI>love</HI> unto them; and finally that He was bound and &s;o were others to ble&s;s &amp; prai&s;e the LORD his God, and give him all the <HI>Glory</HI> of his Ad|vancement to and E&s;tabli&s;hment on his Throne: <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord thy God which delighted in thee,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Words teach us this <HI>Doctrinal Truth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>THAT when God rai&s;es up a wi&s;e and good KING to do Judgment and Ju&s;tice, it is a &s;ignal Expre&s;&s;ion of his delight in Him and of his love unto his People, for which they are highly Obliged to laud and prai&s;e him.</HI> Or, <HI>That when God delights in a PRINCE to &s;et him on the Throne over his People, becau&s;e he loves them, they are highly obliged to render Him their thankful prai&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>I will take the <HI>Text</HI> into the following <HI>Propo&s;itions.</HI></P>

<PB N="7" REF="001805_0006_0FB842C6DB575420" MS="y">
<ITEM>1. That it is the GOD of Heaven that makes Men Kings, and &s;ets them on their Thrones.</ITEM>

<P N="1">I. <HI>THAT it is the GOD of Heaven that makes Men Kings and &s;ets them upon their Thrones.</HI> So the <HI>Text</HI> &s;ays that it was the <HI>LORD GOD</HI> that &s;et <HI>Solomon</HI> on the Throne, and made him King. The Dominion and Providence of God is the Supream, Ab&s;olute and Uni|ver&s;al <HI>Government.</HI> <Q>The Heavens are his Throne and the Earth is his Foot&s;tool. He is Lord of all. He rules in the Armies of Heaven above, and over the Inhabitants of Earth below, and doeth his Will. His is the Kingdom the Power and the Glory. He is the Ble&s;&s;ed and only Potentate, King
<PB N="8" REF="001805_0007_0FB842C7F0A5D3B0">of Kings and LORD of Lords. His is the Greatne&s;s, and the power and the Glory and the Victory and the Maje&s;ty; for all that is in the Heaven and on the Earth is his: Both riches and honour come of him, and he reigns over all, and in his hand is Power and Might, and in his hand it is to make Great and to give Strength unto all. He the mo&s;t High ruleth in the King|doms of Men, &amp; giveth them to whom&s;oe|ver he will. Wi&s;dom &amp; Might are His: He changeth the Times and Sea&s;ons; He re|moveth Kings and &s;etteth up Kings; He giveth wi&s;dom unto the Wi&s;e, and Know|ledge to them that know Under&s;tanding. Thus the Kingdom is the Lords, and he is the Governour among the Nations: The Shields of the Earth belong to him, and he is greatly Exalted.</Q></P>
<P>THE Dominions and Thrones, the Princi|palities and Powers in Heaven are his Sub|jects and Va&s;&s;als; and &s;o are Soverain Prin|ces here on Earth. <HI>The Lord is high above all Nations, and his Glory above the Heavens. Who is like unto the Lord our God, who dwelleth on High! who humbles him&s;elf to behold the things that are in Heaven and on the Earth! He rai&s;eth up the Poor out of the du&s;t, and lifteth the Needy out of the dunghill, that he may &s;et him with
<PB N="9" REF="001805_0008_0FB842C965BE27B8" MS="y">Princes, even with the Princes of his People.</HI> He gives to Men their <HI>Princely Spirits,</HI> and <HI>another heart,</HI> and calls them forth to Reign; Again he <HI>cuts off the Spirit of Princes and is terrible to the Kings of the Earth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>BY Him Kings reign and Princes decree Ju|&s;tice, by Him Princes rule and Nobles, even all the Judges of the Earth.</HI> Sometimes by a &s;in|gular Providence he brings Them to their Thrones <HI>without their &s;eeking</HI> and calls them to reign by a clear and certain loud Voice of his Providence and of a People, without their A&s;piring or forming De&s;igns for their own Advancement; a wonderful Providence <HI>makes the motion</HI> to them, and opens their Way before them: As <HI>David</HI> was &s;urpri&s;ed by the Divine <HI>Election</HI> and <HI>Anointing,</HI> and then by Providence call'd to <HI>Court</HI> and on the &s;tage of Action; And to the Conduct of Providence he <HI>re&s;ign'd</HI> him&s;elf and waited on it to chu&s;e his Way and lead him in it, and in Its own time to crown him. Such a KING was <HI>Solomon,</HI> of God's chu&s;ing and Anoint|ing: He was not the <HI>Elde&s;t Son,</HI> nor the <HI>fir&s;t Branch</HI> of the <HI>Royal Stock;</HI> but the <HI>Per&s;on</HI> whom God pitch'd upon and Endowed to fill the Throne.</P>
<P>AND &s;uch a KING we ble&s;s God for this day, whom He Him&s;elf has cho&s;en and
<PB N="10" REF="001805_0009_0FB842CAF860F7D8">called to the Throne, and e&s;tabli&s;hed there|on, by a <HI>Wonderful and Over-ruling Govern|ment</HI> of his own Soverain, Wi&s;e and Gracious Providence. It has been the Lord's doing and wonderful in our Eyes. The <HI>Hearts of Kings and Nobles</HI> are in the hand of God, and &s;o the <HI>Hearts of a Wi&s;e and free People</HI> and the Lord turned them in the <HI>Reign before the la&s;t,</HI> in a legal manner to fix the <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> to the Crown on the Serene Hou&s;e of <HI>HAN|NOVER,</HI> being the next <HI>Prote&s;tant Heirs.</HI> The Sub&s;equent <HI>Parliaments</HI> in the following <HI>Reign</HI> did from time to time and many ways Confirm that wi&s;e and Happy <HI>Settlement</HI> of the Crown; which render'd it the mo&s;t <HI>Le|gal and Rightful</HI> that could be. And when at la&s;t &s;ome <HI>Adonijah</HI> was exalting him&s;elf, and &s;aying <HI>I will be King,</HI> under the &s;ecret Aid and Abetting of <HI>&s;uch as Joab and Abiathar the Prie&s;t;</HI> then better <HI>Nobles and Princes of the Nation,</HI> both Temporal and Spiritual, &s;uch as <HI>Zadock</HI> and <HI>Benaiah</HI> and <HI>Nathan the Pro|phet</HI> remembred the <HI>Royal. Oath</HI> and the En|gagement of Providence, and &s;aid to one another&mdash;"Did we not <HI>&s;wear</HI> by the Lord, and give the <HI>Public Faith</HI> unto our People and unto the Serene Hou&s;e of <HI>Hannover,</HI> that they &s;hou'd now <HI>Reign</HI> and &s;it upon the Throne over us? <HI>As the Lord liveth that re|deemeth
<PB N="11" REF="001805_0010_0FB842D01F220FF0" MS="y">our Soul out of all di&s;tre&s;s, as we &s;ware unto them by the LORD our God, even &s;o will we certainly do this day:</HI> So they blew the Trumpet and all the People &s;aid, <HI>God &s;ave King George;</HI> &s;houting and rejoicing with &s;o great a Joy as made the Earth to rend again. The <HI>Pretender</HI> to the Crown and his <HI>wretched Adherents</HI> were beyond mea&s;ure &s;urpri&s;ed and amazed at the <HI>wondrous Turn.</HI> Scarce cou'd they believe their own Eyes and Ears. And tho&s;e that <HI>wi&s;h'd and waited</HI> for the Event, but had long <HI>de&s;pair'd</HI> of ever &s;eeing it, were now <HI>like them that dream; then was their mouth filled with laughter and their tongue with &s;inging;</HI> then &s;aid they one to another, <HI>The LORD hath done Great Things for us whereof we are glad:</HI> O <HI>Lord turn again our Captivity as the Streams of the South,</HI> i.e. As when God &s;ends Streams of Water in a hot and parching Sea|&s;on to refre&s;h and revive a Land.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>WITH a peculiar Care God fills the Throne of his I&s;rael.</HI> The Lord's Portion is his People; as <HI>Jacob</HI> was his Inheritance. <HI>Happy is the People that is in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, yea happy is that People who&s;e GOD is the LORD.</HI> It plea&s;es the LORD to make &s;ome Places and People more his own <HI>Peculiar</HI> than others. As the <HI>Children of I&s;rael</HI> were &s;o of old, &s;o are the
<PB N="12" REF="001805_0011_0FB842D178F5F090"><HI>Places</HI> which God now favours with the Ad|mini&s;trations of the Kingdom of his Grace in the Purity and Power of them. <HI>The Peo|ple &s;hall dwell alone, and not be numbred among the Nations.</HI> They are a favoured and di&s;tin|gui&s;hed Race whom God has taken near to him&s;elf, and mark'd out for his Own, and given to them his <HI>Adoption, his Covenant, his Law and Promi&s;es.</HI> So when at fir&s;t the <HI>Mo&s;t High</HI> divided to the Nations their Inheri|tance, when he Separated the Sons of <HI>Adam,</HI> he &s;et the Bounds of the People according to the number of the Children of <HI>I&s;rael:</HI> He found him, he led him about, he In&s;tructed him, and kept him as the Apple of his Eye; So the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no &s;trange God with him. God gave them not a <HI>King</HI> like the Nations round about them, for the LORD him&s;elf was their King, &amp; their Government a <HI>Theocracy.</HI> But when they in proce&s;s of time would have a King like the Nations round about them, God <HI>cho&s;e them their Kings.</HI> And how many mo&s;t <HI>Excellent Princes</HI> did God rai&s;e up to them to be their Governours in Supream? <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> and the <HI>Judges; David</HI> and <HI>Solomon,</HI> &amp;c. It is true too that <HI>I&s;rael</HI> had their <HI>Evil Princes,</HI> more e&s;pecially in their la&s;t and <HI>degenerate Times;</HI> for as they grew
<PB N="13" REF="001805_0012_0FB842D266B18868" MS="y"><HI>wor&s;e and wor&s;e,</HI> they had at la&s;t the <HI>wor&s;t of Kings,</HI> who were given them in Wrath, and bro't on their la&s;t De&s;tructions and <HI>Captivi|ties.</HI></P>
<P>AND thus it is with the Profe&s;&s;ing Peo|ple of God unto this day: altho' it &s;eems to &s;are with one Nation as with another, all things hapning alike to all, to the Good and to the bad, as well to <HI>Places</HI> as <HI>Per&s;ons.</HI> There are <HI>Tyrants</HI> and <HI>U&s;urpers</HI> and <HI>Pretenders</HI> and <HI>Traitors</HI> in one Country and in another; and we cannot know good or evil by all that is before us. Neverthele&s;s there is really a more &s;pecial Providence concerning is &s;elf for and exerci&s;ed towards the Profe&s;&s;ing and Covenant People of God, <HI>and that more or le&s;s peculiar too as they are more or le&s;s reformed, and as there is more or le&s;s of Vital Religion, Spiritual Wor&s;hip, and true Obedience among a people.</HI> So the Lord <HI>loves</HI> a people as he makes them <HI>his Own;</HI> and as they <HI>know</HI> and <HI>fear him</HI> they are <HI>dear</HI> to him and his <HI>&s;pecial Care; All his Saints are in his hand, and they &s;it down at his feet and receive of his Words.</HI> He covers them and he bears them <HI>on Eagles wings,</HI> and makes them to ride on the high places of the Earth.</P>
<P>AND in &s;ome Mea&s;ure of Great di&s;tin|ction, &s;uch has been the Grace and Favour

BUT was it for <HI>Solomon</HI>'s &s;ake only, or <HI>David</HI>'s either, that God delighted in Him to make him this Wi&s;e and Good and Great Prince? No, no! As David &s;aid on this very Occa&s;ion, (that is, on the Promi&s;e and Pro&s;pect of it,) <HI>Who am I and what is my hou&s;e&mdash;! O Lord according to thine own Heart ha&s;t thou done all this Greatne&s;s! &mdash;for thou did&s;t make thy People I&s;rael thine own peo|ple and became&s;t their God.</HI> In truth there can be no higher <HI>Compliment</HI> made to a Prince than <HI>the&s;e two</HI> in the Text; Becau&s;e the Lord thy God <HI>delighted in thee,</HI> and be|cau&s;e <HI>he loved his People for Ever. Huram</HI> the King of <HI>Tyre</HI> knew this, and Congratulates in the&s;e very Words: 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 2.11. Becau&s;e the Lord hath loved his people, he has made thee King over them.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IT is in Kindne&s;s to the Prince him&s;elf, and God</HI>'s <HI>delight in the Per&s;on whom he makes a Good and Wi&s;e and Righteous Prince.</HI> For wherein can Providence &s;how a Man more favour on this &s;ide Heaven (at lea&s;t in a Hu|mane Judgment of things) than fir&s;t to <HI>quali|fie and furni&s;h</HI> Him for the highe&s;t Dignities and Powers in the World, and then to <HI>ad|vance</HI> him to them? It is no ways de&s;irable
<PB N="21" REF="001805_0020_0FB842E923745AE0" MS="y">to be a Prince in Name or by Birth without a <HI>Princely Spirit:</HI> The <HI>folly</HI> is but the more expo&s;ed in the high <HI>Dignity.</HI> Rule carries worldly Greatne&s;s, Riches and Honour a|long with it; but the <HI>true Glory</HI> lies in the Internal Accompli&s;hments of the Mind, In|tellectual and Moral. A <HI>Prince</HI> without <HI>Knowledge</HI> becomes an <HI>Image</HI> and a <HI>Stock;</HI> or it may be a <HI>Scorpion,</HI> a roaring <HI>Lion</HI> and a ranging <HI>Bear</HI> to the poor people: Or tho' the <HI>Prince</HI> have the Knowledge of an <HI>Angel</HI> yet if without <HI>Goodne&s;s and Vertue</HI> he only becomes a <HI>Devil</HI> to his wretched Subjects. Wherefore I conclude, that as it is no favour to us that we <HI>be,</HI> unle&s;s we be wi&s;e and good; &s;o neither is it any favour of Provi|dence to any one that he is a <HI>Prince,</HI> a <HI>Go|vernour,</HI> a <HI>Magi&s;trate,</HI> if he be a fooli&s;h and a wicked one.

His Advancement is a Judgment upon him&s;elf and a Cur&s;e to his People. But now where there is Per&s;onal Worth and a Prinoly Spirit, Solomon's Wi&s;dom and Largene&s;s of Heart, and then a Throne given to <HI>&s;hine</HI> on and Power to <HI>do good</HI> with, how has God delighted to honour the Per&s;on? To make

There is as much difference between a wi&s;e Prince and one that is <HI>de&s;titute within,</HI> as there is between the Princes Stamp on <HI>Paper</HI> and on <HI>Gold.</HI> The one has an Intrin&s;ic Va|lue and is worth what it pa&s;&s;es at, but the other in a time of nece&s;&s;ity may pa&s;s for as much when it is in it&s;elf worth nothing. Then again, what a <HI>noble Plea&s;ure</HI> is it to a Princely Mind, to be in <HI>Gods &s;tead</HI> to the World in re&s;pect of unknown Benefits done to it, and to know that he reigns not only <HI>over</HI> &s;uch a Kingdom and Provinces, but <HI>in</HI> the Reverence, Honour, E&s;teem and Love of the hearts of all that are Wi&s;e and Good in his Dominions? While fooli&s;h and wick|ed Princes are contemned and de&s;pi&s;ed, loath'd and hated in the hearts of them whom they tyranni&s;e over and oppre&s;s.
