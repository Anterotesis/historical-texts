<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE de&s;ign of the following E&s;&s;ay was, partly to era|dicate &s;ome ab&s;urd notions which have been hand|ed down from the darke&s;t periods of antiquity, and which are &s;till entertained by &s;ome, upon the appearance of a Comet; and to remove the apprehen&s;ions which may have been excited in the minds of others, even by the writings of &s;ome great men among the moderns: And partly to offer to tho&s;e who indulge them&s;elves in more ab&s;tru&s;e re&s;earches after the operations of natural cau&s;es, a few hints, the pro&s;ecution of which may enlarge the field of philo&s;ophical &s;peculation, and open to all a new &s;ource for adoration of the wi&s;dom and beneficence of that Being, who has made nothing in vain, and has di&s;po&s;ed the various parts of the Univer&s;e by <HI>weight and mea&s;ure.</HI> It may therefore be pre&s;umed, that, if the Author is &s;o happy as to be under&s;tood by the gene|rality of his readers (which he has aimed at throughout the whole) the gentlemen of &s;cience will pardon tho&s;e minute di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, which <HI>they</HI> may judge unnece&s;&s;ary, and that they will weigh with impartiality the arguments which may be offered for their con&s;ideration, overlook any immaterial inaccuracies, which may have ari&s;en through inadvertency, and point out and refute with candour any mi&s;takes which <HI>he</HI> may have fallen into.</P>
<P>IT is now well known to a&s;tronomers that the motions of Comets are regulated by the univer&s;al law of gravitation, and that they regard the Sun as the common center of all their motions, equally with the Planets, although they are
<PB N="ii" REF="012498_0005_0F8A8ECE57FD3C40">more numerous, and apparently di&s;tinct in &s;pecies from them. The Planets, &s;ince the di&s;covery of the <HI>Satellites</HI> or <HI>Moons</HI> which attend &s;ome of them, are generally, and with the highe&s;t rea&s;on &s;uppo&s;ed to be inhabited Worlds like the Earth.&mdash; Whereas it has been thought even by &s;ome of the greate&s;t modern a&s;tronomers, that the extremes of heat and cold to which Comets are alternately expo&s;ed in the different parts of their orbits, are irreconcileable with the notion of their being fit habitations for any material race of beings what|ever. They are to this day regarded by the bulk of man|kind, either as <HI>portentous meteors,</HI> exhibited only to threaten war, famine or pe&s;tilence to the inhabitants of the Earth; or as <HI>fiery globes</HI> which move thro' the Heavens at random, and might fortuitou&s;ly come acro&s;s the Earth in its way, to it is no &s;mall detriment, if not to the de&s;truction of its inhabitants; or la&s;tly as <HI>penal worlds,</HI> ordained to a perpetual chaotic &s;tate, who&s;e inhabitants are condemned to be frozen and burned alternately, at their <HI>aphelia</HI> and <HI>peri|helia;</HI> agreeable to <HI>Milton</HI>'s idea of the puni&s;hment of apo&s;tate &s;pirits; &s;peaking of whom he &s;ays,
<Q><L>"They&mdash;feel by turns the bitter change</L>
<L>Of fierce extremes, extremes by change more fierce,</L>
<L>From beds of raging fire to &s;tarve in ice</L>
<L>Their &s;oft aethereal warmth, and there to pine</L>
<L>Immovable, infix'd, and frozen round</L>
<L><HI>Periods of time,</HI> thence <HI>hurried</HI> back to fire."</L>
<BIBL>PARADISE LOST, Book II.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>THE fir&s;t of the&s;e opinions was exploded long ago by <HI>Seneca;</HI> who, in&s;tead of regarding Comets as tran&s;ient meteors, on the contrary ranks them with "the eternal works of Nature." The &s;econd directly contradicts the
<PB N="iii" REF="012498_0005_0F8A8ECE57FD3C40">idea of a divine &s;uperintendency, and falls of cour&s;e, in the minds of tho&s;e who entertain any ju&s;t apprehen&s;ion of the providential care of the great Author and Governor of the Univer&s;e. And as to the la&s;t, with what colour of rea&s;on can we &s;uppo&s;e that the Creator would provide upwards of fifty Worlds (for &s;o many different Comets and more there certainly are) &s;olely for the puni&s;hment of the incor|rigible inhabitants of five or &s;ix Planets only? On the contrary does it not redound more to his honour, to con&s;ider the&s;e bodies as &s;o many inhabited Worlds, provided with every nece&s;&s;ary for the comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tance of innumera|ble inhabitants, rational and irrational, like the Earth? Or as Doctor <HI>Young</HI> (&s;peaking of the CREATOR and his works) beautifully expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf;
<Q><L>"Darts not <HI>HIS</HI> Glory a &s;till brighter Ray,</L>

<BIBL>NIGHT THOUGHTS, Night 9.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>THE reader will find (in the introduction) that the con&s;ideration of the &s;ubject, in this light, was fir&s;t &s;tarted by <HI>Hugh William&s;on,</HI> M. D. of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> in a treati&s;e that was publi&s;hed in one of the weekly papers; which, as it contained &s;ome new thoughts, the pur&s;uit of which (it was judged) would tend to the improvement of natural philo&s;ophy, fir&s;t induced the Author to undertake the following E&s;&s;ay, upon a &s;ubject indeed which, till then, he had but little attended to: He therefore hopes that, if any ob&s;ervations or reflections &s;hall turn up, in the cour&s;e of it, which may merit the attention of his readers, and may have e&s;caped the notice of others, they may in &s;ome mea&s;ure
<PB N="iv" REF="012498_0006_0F8A8ECF10647110">atone for the many defects; of which he is apprehen&s;ive, and which are &s;ubmitted to tho&s;e who have made greater pro|ficiency in natural knowledge, than he pretends to, to rectify.</P>
<P>DIVERS of the Author's friends, who are gentlemen of &s;peculation and learning, peru&s;ed the E&s;&s;ay in manu&s;cript, upon who&s;e approbation of it, and at who&s;e reque&s;t, he was induced to con&s;ent to its publication: But when the unex|pected number of &s;ub&s;cribers, and their re&s;pectable characters in general, came to his knowledge, his diffidence of its title to their fovourable reception was naturally increa&s;ed, which would have excited in his mind a proportionable reluctance to its appearance abroad, le&s;t their expectations &s;hould be di&s;ap|pointed, had he not been fully per&s;uaded, that the greate&s;t candour was naturally to be expected from tho&s;e who are the be&s;t judges of the &s;ubject; e&s;pecially, as the treati&s;e con|tains nothing more than an attempt to di&s;cover &s;ome phi|lo&s;ophical truths, the knowledge of which may tend to pro|mote the cau&s;e of Science, and thereby may po&s;&s;ibly be of &s;ome &s;ervice to mankind.</P>
<P>IT was with plea&s;ure He found that Doctor <HI>Gowin Knight,</HI> F. R. S. had attempted to account for the phaenomena of the tails of Comets from the &s;ame principle which he has endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h in the following pages, viz. a mutual repellency, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the atmo&s;pheres of the heavenly bodies: As the Doctor, when he wrote his treati&s;e, was engaged in the general &s;olution of all the phaenomena in Nature, by the help of two univer&s;al principles, viz. Attraction and Repul&s;ion, he but &s;lightly touched upon the particular phaenomena, now under con&s;ideration; accordingly what he &s;ays upon the &s;ubject is
<PB N="v" REF="012498_0006_0F8A8ECF10647110">very &s;hort, being included within the compa&s;s of a &s;ingle corollary, which ari&s;es out of a long chain of deductions from the <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> properties of an <HI>imaginary</HI> repellent fluid, uniformly di&s;tributed <HI>throughout the infinity of &s;pace;</HI> the exi&s;tence of which, however probable, has never been proved: When the author wrote that part of the E&s;&s;ay which is confined particularly to this &s;ubject, Doctor <HI>Knight</HI>'s &s;olution was entirely out of his mind, if he had ever &s;een it before. He therefore took a different cour&s;e to e&s;tabli&s;h the principle, deducing it from the <HI>known</HI> pro|perties of air, a <HI>real</HI> fluid, the exi&s;tence of which we are <HI>certain</HI> of, from the <HI>immediate te&s;timony of our &s;en&s;es,</HI> as we are of its properties from <HI>innumerable experiments.</HI> This element differs e&s;&s;entially from the Doctor's univer&s;al fluid, which indeed he &s;uppo&s;es to con&s;i&s;t of particles mutually repellent, like tho&s;e of air, but &s;o inconceivably rare, that a quantity of it &s;ufficient to fill the whole &s;pace occupied by the &s;olar Sy&s;tem, might not weigh one &s;ingle grain (Knight's E&s;&s;ay, page 15): Air on the contrary, is a heavy fluid, the pre&s;&s;ure of which, merely from its gravity, is capable of giving great pain to tho&s;e who may attempt to &s;u&s;tain its weight, in pneumatical experiments.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, it does not follow, that if air, con|&s;idered as a fluid <HI>&s;ui generis,</HI> is &s;ufficient <HI>immediately</HI> to account for the phaenomena before us, we &s;hould therefore exclude the agency of another, upon who&s;e exi&s;tence and properties (if proved) the properties of air it&s;elf may po&s;&s;ibly depend. By &s;uppo&s;ing &s;uch an univer&s;al <HI>repellent</HI> fluid, Doctor <HI>Knight</HI> has very curiou&s;ly accounted for many of the phaenomena of Nature, which are &s;o common as to be but little attended to; &s;uch as <HI>fluidity, ela&s;ticity, mag|neti&s;m,</HI> &amp;c. And, whether the mutual repellency of the
<PB N="vi" REF="012498_0007_0F8A8ED0E3C0DCD0">particles of air does (as he &s;uppo&s;es) or does not depend upon the pre&s;ence of the &s;ame fluid, the conclu&s;ion will equally follow that, <HI>The aerial atmo&s;pheres of the heavenly bodies are mutually repellent.</HI></P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION TO THE ESSAY.</HEAD>
<P>IN the month of <HI>September,</HI> 1769, during the ap|pearance of a remarkable Comet, Doctor <HI>Hugh William&s;on</HI> of <HI>Philadelphia</HI> favoured the publick with a treati&s;e on the &s;ubject of the following E&s;&s;ay, which was read before, and publi&s;hed by order of the Philo&s;ophical Society in that city. This piece con|tained &s;ome curious hints, well de&s;erving the attention of the friends of &s;cience: Particularly, that Com|ets, as well as the Planets, may be <HI>habitable Worlds;</HI> that the comfortable &s;tate the inhabitants of the various globes of the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem enjoy, may not depend merely upon their &s;everal di&s;tances from the Sun; and, that although the rays of the Sun may be ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the very exi&s;tence of planetary heat, yet the temperature of that heat may depend upon the den&s;ities of the atmo&s;pheres &s;urrounding the &s;everal globes; whereby the Comets, even in their aphelia, may be rendered comfortable habitations, by means of the va&s;t atmo&s;pheres which attend them, and which, when they might become detrimental to their inhabitants, as when they are in the neighbourhood of the Sun, are, by the momentum of the Sun's rays, or by &s;ome other cau&s;e, thrown off to immen&s;e di&s;tances behind them.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="012498_0008_0F8A8ED1704FD028">
THE peru&s;al of this treati&s;e occa&s;ioned the following attempt to e&s;tabli&s;h the doctrine of the habitability of Comets, advanced therein by Doctor William&s;on.</P>
<P>We differ indeed in our hypothe&s;es to account for the phaenomena of their tails; but which&s;oever may be the true one, all <HI>his</HI> conclu&s;ions, relative to the den|&s;ities of their atmo&s;pheres in the various parts of their orbits, may equally follow.</P>
<P>THE Doctor's hypothe&s;is, which is the &s;ame with <HI>Kepler</HI>'s, &s;uppo&s;es the atmo&s;phere of a Comet, by the velocity and con&s;equent momentum of the Sun's rays, to be propelled through immen&s;e &s;paces behind its body, whereby the tail is formed, which is rendered vi&s;ible by reflecting tho&s;e rays.</P>
<P>THIS, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, &s;eems to be as natural and ea&s;y a &s;olution as any one hitherto offered; and might be embraced as &s;uch, had any one experiment ever been produced to prove the rays of light endued with any &s;uch power, even upon the mo&s;t minute cor|pu&s;cles, or the mo&s;t rarefied vapor, Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> pa&s;&s;es it by with little more than a bare mention, (Princip. under Prop. XLI. Book III.) which, as it is &s;o plau&s;ible, is difficult to account for; e&s;pecially as he fills pages to refute others, that are almo&s;t &s;elf-evidently ab&s;urd. This hypothe&s;is, however, has ne|ver been confirmed by any one experiment, although an age has elap&s;ed &s;ince <HI>Kepler</HI>'s time, during which experimental philo&s;ophy has been at its zenith. There|fore, as Mr. Profe&s;&s;or <HI>Winthrop,</HI> in his lectures on Comets, ob&s;erves, <Q>much &s;tre&s;s &s;hould not be laid
<PB N="3" REF="012498_0008_0F8A8ED1704FD028">upon it, as we know of no parallel in&s;tance in na|ture to &s;upport it.</Q> The hypothe&s;is contained in this E&s;&s;ay is founded upon a mutual repellency, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;ub&s;i&s;t between the &s;everal atmo&s;pheres of the heavenly bodies; which is deduced from the repellency of the particles of air, of which the atmo&s;|phere of the earth, and tho&s;e which &s;urround the other globes, are compo&s;ed. That our atmo&s;phere con&s;i&s;ts of particles thus repellent, is certain from the whole &s;y&s;tem of pneumaticks, as no one experiment, in that u&s;eful, in&s;tructive and entertaining branch of natural philo&s;ophy, can be performed, which does not depend upon this property of AIR. That the Sun and Planets have &s;imilar atmo&s;pheres, will appear in the following pages.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> after having refuted &s;everal hypothe&s;es, which had been rai&s;ed by others, to account for the a&s;cent of Comets tails from the Sun, at length rather hints at, than &s;ub&s;titutes one of his own; as he a&s;&s;erts nothing po&s;itively, but only offers a query for the con|&s;ideration of his readers. Therefore it is hoped that nothing here advanced will be con&s;idered as a <HI>vain, ra&s;h</HI> attempt to confute that illu&s;trious author. <Q>The a&s;cent of &s;moke in a chimney (&s;ays he) is owing to the impul&s;e of the air with which it is entangled. The air, rarefied by heat, a&s;cends becau&s;e its &s;pecific gravity is dimini&s;hed, and in its a&s;cent carries along with it the &s;moke with which it is engaged</Q> (Prin|cip. ubi &s;upra). To which he adds the following query: <Q>And why may not the tail of a Comet ri&s;e from the Sun after the &s;ame manner?</Q> Previous to an an|&s;wer to this query, let us con&s;ider more particularly
<PB N="4" REF="012498_0009_0F8A8ED21AEB0D60">the cau&s;es of the a&s;cent of vapors in our atmo&s;phere. It is indeed beyond doubt, that to the cau&s;e above a&s;&s;igned, by Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> is in a great mea&s;ure owing the ri&s;e of &s;moke from common fire; from which, if enkindled in the open air, it will curl up in broad volumes, &s;preading as it ri&s;es; but if confined in a chimney, the rarefied air having but one way to expand it&s;elf, viz. through the funnel, the more con|den&s;ed air in the room below driving it upwards, to|gether with the &s;moke engaged with it, it a&s;cends in a &s;trait cour&s;e, with a greater velocity, and apparently to a greater height than when unconfined.</P>
<P>BUT this is not the &s;ole, nor yet the principal cau&s;e of the a&s;cent of vapors in general, but rather an acci|dental one, which increa&s;es their velocity when already on the wing. For, <HI>really,</HI> the <HI>cau&s;a &s;ine qua non</HI> of their a&s;cent, in a quie&s;cent atmo&s;phere, is the difference of the &s;pecific gravities of tho&s;e vapors, and the air they float in<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">How they are generated, and detached from the &s;urfaces of bodies, is a proper &s;ubject for an enquiry by it&s;elf, but foreign here.</NOTE>; the former, being generally lighte&s;t, continue ri&s;ing till they arrive at that region of the at|mo&s;phere in which the den&s;ities of both are equal.&mdash;There they gather and form into clouds;
there they remain &s;u&s;pended, or are driven by winds in directions parallel to the &s;urface of the Earth, until &s;ome ca&s;ual rarefaction of the air, the meeting of contrary winds, or of electrified clouds differently charged, cau&s;e them, either to conden&s;e imperceptibly, and fall in dews or gentle rains, or to ru&s;h more violently together, and precipitate in &s;howers, according to the nature of the cau&s;e by which they are actuated. The &s;moke of a
<PB N="5" REF="012498_0009_0F8A8ED21AEB0D60">chimney is for the mo&s;t part lighter than the circum|ambient air it a&s;cends through, otherwi&s;e it would de&s;cend again as &s;oon as it could di&s;engage it&s;elf from that column of air which carried it up; in con&s;equence of which, life would be very uncomfortable in large, populous cities; for, at times, the air with us is &s;o rarefied that the &s;moke does in fact thus de&s;cend, and hover ju&s;t above the &s;urface of the Earth, to the no &s;mall annoyance of the eyes and lungs of tho&s;e who breathe in &s;uch an impure medium. Were it nece&s;&s;ary, experiments in pneumaticks might be recited, which prove that air, near the &s;urface of the Earth, is in ge|neral den&s;er or heavier than the &s;moke and other vapors which float therein; which are here omitted, as it is pre&s;umed the fact will not be di&s;puted.</P>
<P>NOW, if the tail of a Comet ri&s;es from its head, or rather from the Sun, in the &s;ame manner as &s;moke does from fire with us, and from a &s;imilar cau&s;e, the aethereal medium, thro' which it a&s;cends, mu&s;t be nearly of the &s;ame den&s;ity with the vapors of the tail; other|wi&s;e the latter could not float in, nor get &s;o entangled with it as to be carried up thereby through di&s;tant re|gions of the Heavens; but that the tails may a&s;cend to &s;uch amazing heights, as &s;ome of them do, we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;e their &s;pecific gravities much le&s;s than that of the aether it&s;elf.</P>

<P>A COMET con&s;i&s;ts of two parts which fall under our ob&s;ervation, viz. a &s;olid, &s;pherical, opaque body, which, like the planets, &s;hines by reflecting the light of the Sun, and no way differs in appearance from a planetary globe; this is by a&s;tronomers called the <HI>nucleus:</HI> Al&s;o a very exten&s;ive atmo&s;phere; which, from the form it u&s;ually exhibits to us, is called the <HI>tail,</HI> and commonly exhibits a faint beam of light, which diverges as it recedes from the head, and often appa|rently extends thro' di&s;tant con&s;tellations, when it nearly re&s;embles tho&s;e momentary corru&s;cations which &s;hoot upwards from the horizon towards the zenith, during the appearance of an <HI>aurora borealis,</HI> or northern light.

<P>WE &s;hall now endeavour to prove the following propo&s;itions.</P>
<P>FIRST, THAT the primary Planets, the Comets, and the Sun, are all &s;urrounded with atmo&s;pheres.</P>

<P N="1">1. AS the proof of the exi&s;tence of the at|mo&s;pheres of the Sun, Planets and Comets depends upon a variety of a&s;tronomical ob&s;ervations, it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to be particular as to each of them.</P>

<P N="8">8.

<P N="2">II. WE &s;hall now endeavour to prove that the planetary, cometary, and &s;olar atmo&s;pheres, con&s;i&s;t of the &s;ame elementary fluid with the atmo&s;phere of the Earth, viz. <HI>AIR.</HI></P>
<P>AIR is a fluid, which when pure is tran&s;parent, and in the highe&s;t degree ela&s;tic, being indefinitely com|pre&s;&s;ible and dilatable; which qualities are truly cha|racteri&s;tic of it, as we know of no other fluid to which they belong.</P>
<P>IT may be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve here, that upon our globe, which (as already ob&s;erved) is it&s;elf a Planet, the pre&s;ence of air is nece&s;&s;ary, both to the pre&s;ervation of animal life, and to the exi&s;tance of flame: For in a gla&s;s receiver, &s;mall animals die, and candles go out, immediately upon the air being exhau&s;ted; upon air al&s;o &s;eems to depend the explo&s;ive power of enkindled vapors; for gun-powder it&s;elf, one of the mo&s;t powerful agents hitherto invented by the art of man, if fired by an hot Iron in vacuo, will con&s;ume away, but never fla&s;h, nor explode; and it is generally agreed by tho&s;e who are acquainted with experimental philo&s;ophy, that this vi|vifying, inflammating quality of air, depends upon its ela&s;ticity, or the active, contrifugal power of its par|ticles, to be con&s;idered under the next general head. This being premi&s;ed, we proceed to prove, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> THAT the atmo&s;pheres of the &s;everal globes
<PB N="16" REF="012498_0015_0F8A8ED68A1129E8">of the Sy&s;tem con&s;i&s;t of tran&s;parent fluids: The truth of which will be &s;ufficiently evident, if we con&s;ider the &s;everal phaenomena by which they were di&s;covered.</P>
<P>IT has already been &s;hewn that Mars is &s;urrounded with a very exten&s;ive atmo&s;phere; which, had it not been tran&s;parent, mu&s;t have e&s;caped the notice of a&s;|tronomers during the time of the occultation of the &s;tar before mentioned; for were it opaque, it would, by reflecting the Sun's rays, as well as by its want of tran&s;parency, have hid the Planet it&s;elf, and by the ob|&s;ervers have been confounded with it<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In like manner, as Sir I. Newton concludes, (Prin. B. III.

<P>THE changes which are ob&s;ervable in tho&s;e fluctu|ating collections of heterogeneous matter, of which the belts and &s;pots in the other Planets, and the Sun con&s;i&s;t, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, could never have been di&s;covered, were they not &s;u&s;tained in tran&s;parent fluids above the &s;urfaces of their re&s;pective globes.</P>
<P>THE tran&s;parency of the cometic atmo&s;pheres in un|deniable, as their nuclei are frequently &s;een thro' them, although they occupy &s;paces equal to many diameters of the Earth; and the &s;malle&s;t &s;tars are vi&s;ible through

<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> ALTHOUGH there are no ob&s;ervations in the records of a&s;tronomy which prove this ela&s;ticity in the planetary atmo&s;pheres; yet, as the Planets are with the highe&s;t rea&s;on &s;uppo&s;ed to be inhabited Worlds, the pre&s;umption is at lea&s;t very &s;trong, if &s;hort of a demon&s;tration, that their atmo&s;pheres are de&s;igned to an&s;wer purpo&s;es every way &s;imilar to tho&s;e which are ef|fected by the atmo&s;phere of the Earth, and that they are endued with all tho&s;e properties, which are, with us, ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the pre&s;ervation of animal Life, con&s;equently that they are ela&s;tic, as well as tran&s;parent, and alto|gether like our air.</P>
<P>THE atmo&s;phere of the Sun is, by his exce&s;&s;ive lu&s;tre, hid from our view; but if we con&s;ider him as an im|men&s;e flaming globe, kindled up to warm and en|lighten the whole &s;y&s;tem, we may well &s;uppo&s;e that he has a large &s;hare of that fluid, without which (as before ob&s;erved) &s;carcely any flame can &s;ub&s;i&s;t with us for a moment. Some Authors indeed are of opinion, and not without rea&s;on, that the Sun is not a body of fire, as commonly &s;uppo&s;ed; Doctor <HI>Knight</HI> in particular, in his curious treati&s;e of at|traction and repul&s;ion, as two univer&s;al principles, by which he endeavours to &s;olve all the phaenomena in nature, &s;eems to be of opinion, that the inhabitants of the Sun (if inhabited) are in as much danger of

<P>IT mu&s;t here be ob&s;erved; that in rea&s;oning upon gravitation, the great Author of the pre&s;ent phi|lo&s;ophical &s;y&s;tem of the Heavens argues downward from the greater to the le&s;&s;er, from <HI>Worlds</HI> to <HI>Atoms;</HI> thus, finding by mathematical deductions, compared with a&s;tronomical ob&s;ervations, that all the globes of the &s;olar Sy&s;tem, Sun, Planets and Comets gravitate, or have a mutual tendency towards each other, and that this reciprocal attraction is proportional to the quantities of &s;olid matter they re&s;pectively contain; he very ju&s;tly concludes, that every &s;ingle particle in any one of their &s;olid ma&s;&s;es both attracts, and is attracted by, every other particle of matter, contained in every globe throughout the &s;olar Sy&s;tem.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">.</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT as the Heavens exhibit no phaenomena from which we can, directly and with equal certainty, infer the exi&s;tance and univer&s;al extent of the contrary principle of repul&s;ion, as &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the at|mo&s;pheres of the heavenly bodies; we are here obliged to u&s;e a contrary method, and to rea&s;on up|ward from the powers and properties which, by their effects, we di&s;cover to belong to tho&s;e parcels of air upon which we can make experiments; to the effects, which the &s;ame powers and properties would naturally produce, in tho&s;e va&s;t collections of air, which con|&s;titute
<PB N="20" REF="012498_0017_0F8A8ED9A9529148">the atmo&s;pheres of the &s;everal globes; and if by tracing the nece&s;&s;ary operations of the&s;e powers, &s;tep by &s;tep, we can at length arrive at any of the grand phaenomena of nature, we may with the highe&s;t rea&s;on conclude, that the&s;e phaenomena are the effects of tho&s;e powers.</P>
<P>WE &s;hall therefore endeavour to prove from authors of the be&s;t credit, or from experiments which any one may try at his lei&s;ure,</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT there is a mutual repellency &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the particles of air, whereby they continually endeavour to recede from each other; in con&s;equence of which, that fluid is indefinitely dilatable from the centrifugal activity of its particles, as well as com|pre&s;&s;ible by any foreign power.</P>
<P>THE honourable <HI>Robert Boyle,</HI><ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> found by expe|riments, that air might be &s;o rare&s;ied as to occupy 13769 times the &s;pace it fills when in its natural &s;tate near the &s;urface of the Earth<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Abridgment of Boyle, Vol. I.

But the cube root of 826140 is 94 nearly; therefore the central di&s;tances of the particles from each other, as di&s;coverable by actual experiment, may be as one to ninety-four, and that from their centritugal activity.</P>

MOREOVER, Sir <HI>I.

<P N="2">2. THIS mutual repellency of the particles of air is greatly increa&s;ed by heat. For if a bladder not more than half filled with air, be tied up tight, and laid before the fire, the additional expan&s;ive power, which the air contained therein acquires from the heat, will &s;well the bladder to its utmo&s;t extent, and will at length bur&s;t it with an explo&s;ion.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE particles of air, although mutually repel|lent among&s;t them&s;elves, are with regard to other mat|ter, in the common &s;tate of gravitation or attraction. This is evident from their being conden&s;ed in the form of atmo&s;pheres round the &s;olid globes of the Sy&s;tem, and attending them through all their revolutions.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE mutual repellency of the particles of air is indefinitely greater, in proportion to the quantities of repelling matter, than the mutual attraction, &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ing betwixt the &s;olid particles of attracting matter.</P>
<P>THE truth of this propo&s;ition will appear, at lea&s;t highly probable, if we con&s;ider that the quantity of
<PB N="22" REF="012498_0018_0F8A8EDA6F71C080">matter contained in our air near the &s;urface of the Earth, and which gravitates in common with other matter towards its center, is &s;o &s;mall, tho' conden&s;ed by the incumbent weight of the whole atmo&s;phere, that one quart of it weighs no more than eight grains, as appears from experiments; yet &s;o great is the re|pul&s;ive power of its particles, that a &s;mall quantity of it, conden&s;ed by art in the barrel of an air-gun, of the &s;ize and bore of a common fowling-piece, is &s;ufficient, when permitted &s;uddenly to expand it&s;elf through the tube, to di&s;charge a mu&s;ket ball, in the &s;ame manner as fired gun-powder, the noi&s;e excepted, and with the like fatal effects.</P>
<P>WE &s;hall now proceed to prove the following pro|po&s;ition, viz. If two corpu&s;cles of matter be in a &s;tate of mutual repul&s;ion at any given di&s;tance, as <HI>A.

<P>NOW whatever the di&s;tance a&s;&s;igned between the two particles may be, and whatever may be the index of the power which expre&s;&s;es the ratio of the decrea&s;e of their repul&s;ive force, this force will in every ca&s;e be expre&s;&s;ible by a fraction who&s;e numerator is 1, and its denominator equal to the given di&s;tance, in|volved according to the index of the given power, as is evident from in&s;pection of the foregoing fractions as they &s;tand. It can never, therefore, become equal to nothing, until the denominator of the fraction be|comes infinite, which never can be at any a&s;&s;ignable di&s;tance, however great; therefore, the extent of this mutual repul&s;ion is indefinite.

<P>IN mathematical rea&s;oning, the &s;malle&s;t quantities are not to be di&s;regarded, unle&s;s &s;uppo&s;ed &s;maller than any a&s;&s;ignable, as in fluxions, &amp;c.; for, as all the huge ma&s;&s;es of the &s;olar Sy&s;tem, are compo&s;ed of par|ticles of matter inconceivably &s;mall, &s;o their me|chanical effects upon each other are proportional to the numbers of &s;uch component particles they re|&s;pectively contain; and though the mutual effects of
<PB N="24" REF="012498_0019_0F8A8EDC3B8B5CC8">two &s;ingle particles, at any given di&s;tance, might be indefinitely &s;mall, yet we may ea&s;ily conceive, that, when indefinite numbers of &s;uch particles are con&s;oli|dated into one ma&s;s, and exert their influence from a common center, that <HI>that influence</HI> may be as exten|&s;ive as the &s;olar Sy&s;tem, and perhaps as the material univer&s;e. Thus the Sun, by the united attractive force of his con&s;tituent particles, regulates the motions of the Comets, even at their aphelia, where their di&s;tances from him confound the human imagination; amounting in &s;ome of the to many thou&s;ands of millions of miles; yet, at tho&s;e amazing di&s;tances from the Sun, they are by his influence retained in their proper orbits, without any deviation, till at length they are brought back to him again, many of them after excur&s;ions of &s;ome hundreds, and po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome of them after thou&s;ands of years; in effecting which every particle of matter in the Sun, however &s;mall, bears a part.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, the atmo&s;pheres of the heavenly bodies con&s;i&s;t of particles mutually repellent; not con&s;olidated indeed, as that would be incompatible with the nature of the fluid compo&s;ed of them, but each, in con&s;equence of the mutual attraction between its con&s;tituent particles and the globe it &s;urrounds, conden&s;ed into a fluid ma&s;s.</P>
<P>IN this ca&s;e al&s;o, though the mutual repellency be+tween two &s;ingle particles might at a given di&s;tance be indefinitely &s;mall, yet the influence of two &s;uch ma&s;&s;es upon each other, when thus conden&s;ed, may
<PB N="25" REF="012498_0019_0F8A8EDC3B8B5CC8">be as exten&s;ive as in the former ca&s;e of attraction. The united repul&s;ive force of the particles in each, would in like manner exert it&s;elf as from their com|mon center.</P>
<P>LET us, for illu&s;tration of the &s;ubject, &s;uppo&s;e this repellent power between the particles A and B, Fig. 1, to decrea&s;e as the &s;quares of the di&s;tances increa&s;e, then at a di&s;tance equal to 100000000 A B, or, in other words, &s;uppo&s;e the particles A and B removed <HI>one hundred millions</HI> of times further a&s;under than repre&s;ented in the figure, the repul&s;ive force would then be equal to 1/10000000000000000, or to one <HI>ten-thou&s;and-million-millionth</HI> part of what it is at the &s;imple di&s;tance A B; which, though &s;mall indeed, is yet &s;omething, for the &s;ame di&s;tance remaining, viz. 100000000 A B, if <HI>ten thou&s;ands of millions of millions</HI> of &s;uch particles of equal bulk and repellency were conden&s;ed round the point A as a center, then the repul&s;ive force between the ma&s;s at A and the particle B would be equal to that between the two &s;ingle par|ticles A and B, at the di&s;tance A B; once more, &s;uppo&s;e the &s;ame di&s;tance, viz. 100000000 A B to remain, and the particle B to have the &s;ame number of repellent particles conden&s;ed round it, as we have already &s;uppo&s;ed, to be conden&s;ed round A; then the repul&s;ive power &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the two ma&s;&s;es would be <HI>ten thou&s;ands of millions of millions</HI> of times greater than between the two particles <HI>A</HI> and <HI>B,</HI> at the di&s;tance <HI>A B.</HI></P>

<P>IT &s;eems mo&s;t agreeable to mathematical rea&s;oning, to &s;uppo&s;e, that all powers, whether attractive or repel|lent, which act in right lines, to, or from the centers of the attracting or repelling bodies, are proportioned to the inver&s;e ratio of the <HI>&s;quares</HI> of the di&s;tances of their centers.

<PB N="31" REF="012498_0022_0F8A8EDF8C2BD840">it arrives at its perihelion; entering deeper and deeper within the &s;pheres, both of the repul&s;ion of the Sun's atmo&s;phere, and of the activity of his rays; in con&s;equence whereof the cometic atmo&s;phere is con|tinually rarefying during this de&s;cent, both from the expan&s;ion it undergoes, by means of that re|pul&s;ion, and from the increa&s;ing heat, which it ac|quires, as it approaches the Sun, which heat, as already ob&s;erved, contributes greatly to the repellency of the particles of the aerial fluid. By the con|currence of the&s;e cau&s;es, if admitted, a tail mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily be formed, the length of which would depend, partly upon the quantity of air contained in the cometic atmo&s;phere, and partly upon its proximity to that of the Sun, and con&s;equently would increa&s;e until the Comet arrived at its perihelion, or rather, from the continuance of the cau&s;es, until a few days after, which is mo&s;t agreeable to ob&s;ervation. When a Comet is at this &s;tage of its revolution, if it pa&s;s near the Sun, the tail u&s;ually extends from its head through va&s;t regions of &s;pace, exhibiting a curious &s;pectacle to di&s;tant Worlds.</P>
<P>IF a cometic atmo&s;phere con&s;i&s;ted of an <HI>unela&s;tic</HI> fluid, and were thus repelled by the atmo&s;phere of the Sun. it would put on the form of a very oblong &s;pheroid, both ends of which would be terminated by a regular curvilinear &s;urface as at <HI>A</HI> and <HI>a</HI> (Fig. 3); but as it is an ela&s;tic fluid, who&s;e con&s;tituent particles are, among&s;t them&s;elves, mutually repellent, as &s;oon as ever the at|traction of the nucleus, which before conden&s;ed them &s;pherically round it&s;elf, is dimini&s;hed in <HI>any</HI> part of that atmo&s;phere, by this oppo&s;ite repul&s;ion, the particles

<P>AFTER the perihelion, as the Comet recedes from the Sun, the mutual repul&s;ion of the two atmo&s;pheres gradually decrea&s;es, while the mutual gravitation of the Comet and its own atmo&s;phere proportionably gets the better of it, until at length the exiled atoms are drawn home, and that perhaps without the lo&s;s of a &s;ingle one; unle&s;s the tail &s;hould happen to &s;weep the &s;phere of &s;ome Planet in its way; in which ca&s;e, if the atmo&s;phere of the Planet were large, the mutual repellency of the two would rather occa&s;ion a bifurca|tion of the cometic atmo&s;phere than a union or con|fu&s;ion

<P>THE thickne&s;s of a Comet's tail, or the diameter of a &s;ection made perpendicularly thro' it, is amazingly great towards its extremity; the apparent breadth of the tail of the Comet of 1680, where its di&s;tance from the Earth was equal to the di&s;tance of the Earth from the Sun, was equal to above three apparent diameters of the Sun<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Author remembers to have met with this Ob&s;ervation &s;omewhere, but cannot at pre&s;ent recollect where.

<P>SO much for the third general propo&s;ition, which the reader will receive or reject, according to the weight of the evidence offered in &s;upport of it. It is however hoped that candor will be exerci&s;ed, and that the whole will not be exploded, merely, for want of accuracy in the method, or of per&s;picuity in handling a &s;ubject &s;o difficult of acce&s;s.</P>
<P>A &s;hort digre&s;&s;ion here may not be ami&s;s, in order to prevent the uncomfortable impre&s;&s;ions, which the appearance of a Comet is apt to make upon the minds of &s;ome, and which were greatly increa&s;ed dur|ing the appearance of the Comet of 1769, by an in|judicious publication in one of the &s;outhern news|papers, wherein it was in&s;inuated, that if that Comet &s;hould pa&s;s between the Earth and the Sun, the Earth would pa&s;s through the tail of the Comet; the con|&s;equence of which, the writer &s;uppo&s;ed, might be fatal even to the World it&s;elf. But from the foregoing ob&s;ervations it is evident, that &s;uch apprehen&s;ions were groundle&s;s. The ingenious and learned Mr. <HI>Whi&s;ton</HI> has indeed endeavoured to prove, in order to &s;upport his <HI>Theory,</HI> that a Comet pa&s;&s;ing near the Earth in its de&s;cent towards the Sun, occa&s;ioned the univer&s;al deluge, by leaving behind it a &s;ufficient quantity of vapors from its atmo&s;phere and tail, (in which he &s;uppo&s;ed the Earth to be inveloped,) when conden&s;ed into rain, to drown the World. He fur|ther &s;uppo&s;ed that a Comet, in its a&s;cent from the Sun, might be &s;ufficiently heated to cau&s;e a general Conflagration, &s;hould it find the Earth in the &s;ame
<PB N="35" REF="012498_0024_0F8A8EE110902878">&s;ituation. In con&s;equence of which the fears of many are u&s;ually alarmed, at the appearance of a Comet, by the apprehen&s;ion of &s;ome grand cata&s;trophe. But if the tails of Comets are &s;o extremely rare, as we find they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be, and as every one mu&s;t be convinced they are, who ever &s;aw the Stars &s;hining through them; how can we conceive that the Earth in pa&s;&s;ing through one of them, could carry off <HI>oceans</HI> &s;ufficient to &s;ubmerge <HI>"all the high hills under the whole Heaven"?</HI> to effect which, many of <HI>our</HI> oceans would, doubtle&s;s, be nece&s;&s;ary. On the contrary, it &s;eems probable, from the foregoing con&s;iderations, that the tails of all the Comets which ever appeared, could not, jointly, furni&s;h water &s;ufficient for one <HI>ocean</HI> only.&mdash; If &s;o, the near approach of a Comet mu&s;t be found ut|terly in&s;ufficient to account for the &s;uperior waters of the deluge, or the forty days rain mentioned by <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> whatever di&s;orders might otherwi&s;e be occa&s;ioned in both globes, by their mutual gravitation, in &s;uch vi|cinity. And had the Earth pa&s;&s;ed directly through the mid&s;t of the tail of the Comet of 1769, or of any other, it is not in the lea&s;t probable, unle&s;s the Comet had come near enough to injure us upon other ac|counts, that the Earth could have carried off with it, or that the Comet would have imparted to us, vapors &s;ufficient, even for a common thunder-&s;hower. But this is &s;ubmitted to the reader; who, perhaps, upon the peru&s;al of the &s;econd part of this e&s;&s;ay, may be of opinion, that a Comet, in its a&s;cent from the Sun, is no more calculated to &s;et the World on fire, than to drown it in its de&s;cent. But to return to our &s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="012498_0025_0F8A8EE1D323E700">
HERE a material objection may naturally ari&s;e, viz, why &s;hould the Comets appear with tails, and tho&s;e, generally, of enormous lengths, while the Planets, which have atmo&s;pheres as well as the Com|ets, are always &s;een without them, even when at equal di&s;tances from the Sun?</P>
<P>TO this it may be an&s;wered; that the atmo&s;pheres of the Planets are &s;o &s;mall, in proportion to the globes they &s;urround, compared with tho&s;e of Comets, that whatever may be the cau&s;e of the tails of the latter; if the &s;ame cau&s;e act upon their &s;everal atmo&s;pheres, proportionably to the &s;paces they re&s;pectively occupy, the tails of Comets may appear of a&s;toni&s;hing lengths, while tho&s;e of the Planets &s;hall be totally in&s;en&s;ible. In other words; the Planets in &s;imilar &s;ituations &s;hall have no tails at all.</P>
<P>THE Earth, as has been repeatedly ob&s;erved, is a Planet, with which, as it is the place of our abode, we are well acquainted: The height of its atmo&s;phere is generally computed at about fifty miles; beyond which, its den&s;ity is not &s;ufficient to reflect the rays of the Sun in the crepu&s;culum or twilight: The diameter of the Earth is about 8000 miles, the dia|meter then of the Earth and atmo&s;phere together is about 8100 miles; from whence it appears by com|putation, that the &s;pace occupied by the atmo&s;phere alone is to the &s;pace occupied by the Earth alone, as 1 to 26 nearly.</P>
<P>THE diameter of the atmo&s;phere of a Comet, as before ob&s;erved, is, at a medium, equal to ten times
<PB N="37" REF="012498_0025_0F8A8EE1D323E700">the diameter of its nucleus; and, &s;pheres being as the cubes of their diameters, the magnitude of a Comet and its atmo&s;phere together is equal to one thou&s;and times the magnitude of the Comet alone; con&s;equently, the &s;pace occupied by the atmo&s;phere, is to the &s;pace occupied by the nucleus as 999 to 1.</P>
<P>LET us &s;uppo&s;e a Comet of equal bigne&s;s with the Earth, having an atmo&s;phere as above de&s;cribed, to be &s;o &s;ituated, as that the Sun, the Earth and the Comet, may be in the Angles of an equi|lateral triangle: Let us &s;uppo&s;e al&s;o the vi&s;ible effect of the repelling power of the Sun's atmo&s;phere upon tho&s;e of the Earth and the Comet, to be in pro|portion to the &s;paces they re&s;pectively occupy: The magnitudes of the&s;e atmo&s;pheres being one to the other as 999 to 1/26, that is as 25974 to 1; when a &s;pectator upon the Earth might &s;ee the tail of the Comet extend through an arch in the Heavens of 60&deg;; had the atmo&s;phere of the Earth a tail, ari&s;ing from the &s;ame cau&s;e, in proportion to the &s;pace it oc|cupied, to a &s;pectator upon the Comet it would &s;ub|tend an angle of no more than 0&deg; 0&prime; 8&Prime; 81&tprime; or 60&deg; di|vided by 25974, an angle which the be&s;t in&s;truments could never di&s;cover in an object &s;o dubiou&s;ly defined: In other words, when the Comet would have a tail 60&deg; in length, a Planet at the &s;ame di&s;tance from the Sun would have none at all.</P>
<P>THE atmo&s;pheres of the inferior Planets are pro|bably le&s;s in proportion, and tho&s;e of the &s;uperior, larger than that of the Earth. But this &s;ubject may

<P>The principle of repul&s;ion by which we have en|deavoured to account for the tails of Comets, and their oppo&s;ition to the Sun, may receive further confirma|tion by con&s;idering &s;ome of the phaenomena which the atmo&s;phere of a Comet would exhibit in the neigh-bourhood of the Sun, were the Sun dive&s;ted of his atmo&s;phere, or were his atmo&s;phere deprived of its repellent principle: We &s;hall therefore endeavour to prove the following propo&s;ition, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>WERE the Sun without an atmo&s;phere, or &s;ome other appendage in its nature repellent to the atmo&s;|phere of Comets, and the aethereal &s;paces void of re|&s;i&s;tance; in&s;tead of <HI>one</HI> tail, and that always turned from the Sun, every Comet would have <HI>two;</HI> the direction of one being <HI>towards,</HI> the other <HI>from</HI> the Sun, of which the former would be the mo&s;t con&s;i|derable, and both would increa&s;e as the Comet ap|proached the Sun, from the increa&s;ing gravitation towards him.</P>
<P>FOR though a Comet's atmo&s;phere in its natural &s;tate &s;urrounds the nucleus in a &s;pherical form, (a form that all fluids which tend to a common center of gravity mu&s;t put on) yet if we &s;uppo&s;e this atmo&s;|phere to be affected by its gravitation towards the Sun, and to con&s;i&s;t of an unela&s;tic fluid, like water; tho&s;e parts of this fluid which were neare&s;t to, and mo&s;t remote from the Sun, would have their gravita|tion towards the center of the Comet le&s;&s;ened by the
<PB N="39" REF="012498_0026_0F8A8EE2E5FCC310">Sun's attraction, and thereby, from a &s;pherical form the whole would be changed to an oblong &s;pheroid. This is in fact the ca&s;e with our ocean, which is changed from a &s;phere to a &s;pheroid by the gravita|tion of the Moon; the axis of which &s;pheroid, revol|ving round <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> of the Earth in con&s;equence of the diurnal motion, cau&s;es the flux and reflux of our &s;ea. But the atmo&s;phere of a Comet is indefinitely ela&s;tic, and thence capable of an unlimited expan&s;ion; therefore; in proportion as it is in any part elevated above the &s;uperficies of the &s;phere it occupies when in its natural quie&s;cent &s;tate, &s;uch parts are proportionably at liberty to expand them&s;elves, by virtue of the mu|tual repul&s;ion of their component particles, which are now in great mea&s;ure freed from that con&s;traint which before conden&s;ed them;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Page 31.</NOTE> which would change both ends of the &s;pheroidal figure, to forms &s;imilar to the tails which commonly attend the Comets, being broader as they become rarer towards their extremities, on one &s;ide and the other: But the tail next the Sun would be the mo&s;t con&s;iderable, the effects of his attraction on that &s;ide being greate&s;t; and, &s;hould the Comet approach near enough to the Sun, a continued aerial &s;tream would be formed from one globe to the other, whereby the Sun, by his &s;uperior attractive power, would by de|grees rob the Comet of its atmo&s;phere, conden&s;ing the &s;ame round his own globe, without leaving the Comet a &s;ufficiency for the purpo&s;es of life and vegetation in its &s;olitary retreat without the planetary &s;pheres. But as the Sun has an atmo&s;phere, repellent to the atmo&s;pheres of the other heavenly bodies, the&s;e in|conveniences
<PB N="40" REF="012498_0027_0F8A8EE4B3537720">are thereby prevented, and every globe of the &s;y&s;tem retains its own, unimpaired, through every &s;tage of its revolution.</P>
<P>THAT the projection of the tail of a Comet from its nucleus, and its perpetual oppo&s;ition to the Sun, do ari&s;e from the mutual repellency of the atmo&s;|pheres of Sun and Comet, as we have endeavoured to prove in the foregoing pages; may be confirmed and il|lu&s;trated, if not demon&s;trated by electrical experiments.</P>
<P>THE electric fluid is an element, as di&s;tinct from all others which we are acquainted with, as air is from water; and if there be any &s;uch thing exi&s;ting in na|ture, as pure elementary fire, this claims that character, in preference to all others. For fire, in its common: form, is &s;o far from being a pure element, of it&s;elf, that the pre&s;ence of air is nece&s;&s;ary to its very being. Whereas the electric fire, in many experiments, acts with greater freedom <HI>in vacuo,</HI> than in the open air. But, different as this wonderful &s;ub&s;tance is from all others, we find, that &s;ome of its properties greatly re&s;emble tho&s;e of air, already treated of: And, if the following propo&s;itions, which are introduced to prove that re&s;emblance, can be cofirmed by experiments; and it be allowed, that &s;imilar cau&s;es, naturally, pro|duce &s;imilar effects; it is pre&s;umed, that the &s;olutions of the cometic phaenomena, offered in this e&s;&s;ay, when compo&s;ed with tho&s;e experiments, will be found not inadequate to the phaenomena.</P>
<P><HI>Prop.</HI> 1. THERE is a mutual attraction, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting betwixt the electric fluid and common matter; in
<PB N="41" REF="012498_0027_0F8A8EE4B3537720">con&s;equence of which, the former is capable of, and liable to a conden&s;ation round the latter; in the &s;ame manner as air, by common gravitation, is conden&s;ed round the heavenly bodies, in the form of atmo&s;pheres.</P>
<P>THE truth of this propo&s;ition has been abundantly proved by Doctor: <HI>Franklin,</HI> and other writers upon this &s;ubject: Indeed, the &s;ucce&s;s of all our electrical experiments depends upon this property: We may add further, that all the phaenomena which have ever been ob&s;erved, in which that element is concerned, from the attraction of &s;mall hairs, du&s;t, &amp;c. in con&s;equence of the attrition of amber, to the mo&s;t &s;evere blaze and irre&s;i&s;table force of lightning; de|pend in a great mea&s;ure, upon the &s;ame property.</P>

But if two &s;uch balls be &s;u&s;pended and electrified, and cau&s;ed to approach each other, the threads of each, which happen to be next to the other, in&s;tead of &s;tanding out every way from the center, as before, will be incurvated towards the line of oppo&s;i|tion, as at B and C; whereby the reciprocal repul&s;ion of their atmo&s;pheres is rendered vi&s;ible, as the direct|ions of the threads &s;hew the tendencies of tho&s;e at|mo&s;pheres re&s;pectively; from which it appears, that they recede from each other, as far as the mutual at|traction &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between each atmo&s;phere and its own ball, (which at fir&s;t occa&s;ioned a conden&s;ation of the former round the latter,) will permit. But that the atmo&s;pheres do not wholly fly off, in con&s;equence of this repul&s;ion, is evident, as the threads continue in the &s;ame directions, until one, or both be di&s;charged.</P>

<HEAD>EXPERIMENT III.</HEAD>
<P>PROVIDE a wooden &s;phere, of four or five inches in diameter (call it A); let it be gilt, as the metal will better conden&s;e the electric fluid upon its &s;urface; al&s;o a &s;mall pellet, of cork, or pith of elder (which call B), &s;trung, as in the la&s;t experiment, with a few threads, of three or four inches in length: Suppo&s;e A to repre&s;ent the Sun, B, a Comet; fix A on the wire of an electric bottle, and &s;u&s;pend B by a &s;ilken thread from a point, directly over the center of A, &s;o as that, when neither of them is electrified, B may re&s;t again&s;t A, a little below the level of its center; and charge both ball and pellet. The mutual repellency of their electric atmo&s;phere is &s;o great, as that <HI>that</HI> of B is thrown off as far from A, as the mutual attraction between the pellet and its atmo&s;phere will permit; which attraction is at the &s;ame time &s;o &s;trong, as that, rather than &s;uffer a &s;eparation, the pellet flies off with its atmo&s;phere, to a certain di&s;tance from A, where its na|tural gravitation to the Earth is ju&s;t balanced by the re|pellent force of the two atmo&s;pheres: There B remains
<PB N="46" REF="012498_0030_0F8A8EE65CE5A4E0">at re&s;t, while its atmo&s;phere retires as much farther as po&s;&s;ible from A, without quitting it wholly; in&s;tead of which it undergoes a longitudinal dilatation, in op|po&s;ition to the center of A, as the atmo&s;pheres of Co|mets do, with regard to the Sun: This is evident from the directions of the threads, which, ob&s;erved in a &s;ide view, bear a near re&s;emblance to the tails of Comets. When the pellet is in this &s;ituation, blow it gently with a bellows, in a direction perpendicular to the line connecting the centers; this will give it a projectile motion, which will be regulated by its com|mon gravitation; and as the center of A is directly under the point from which B is &s;u&s;pended, the lat|ter will be carried round the former, as the center of its motion. Thus will this little Comet perform many revolutions round its electric Sun, and in every one, and through every part of each, the tail of threads will con&s;tantly maintain its oppo&s;ition to it, as the tails of Comets do to the Sun in the Heavens.</P>
<P>THIS experiment was very agreeably repeated with an artificial Comet, con&s;i&s;ting of a &s;mall, gilt cork ball, with a tail of leaf-gold, about two inches and an half in length; when, during the whole time of the expe|riment, in which it performed, at lea&s;t, twenty revolu|tions, the tail, as nearly as the eye could judge, was con&s;tantly projected in the line of the oppo&s;ition of the centers of the two balls; the thread, by which the &s;maller one was &s;u&s;pended, either twi&s;ting, or untwi&s;t|ing, the &s;ame way, during the whole time. When thus in motion, if we rai&s;ed the globe, the tail was de|pre&s;&s;ed; when it was lowered, the tail was elevated; maintaining its oppo&s;ition, in every &s;ituation.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="012498_0030_0F8A8EE65CE5A4E0">
BUT now, from the&s;e experiments, &s;ome may, per|haps, be inclined to think, that the electric fluid is the &s;ole cau&s;e of the phaenomena of the tails of Comets: That the Sun, as it is the grand &s;ource of light and heat, throughout our &s;y&s;tem, may be the fountain, from which this element, al&s;o, is &s;omehow derived to its &s;everal globes: That Comets, for wi&s;e ends, un|known to us, have a larger &s;hare of this fluid than the Planets; and that, when they approach the Sun's electrical atmo&s;phere, their own are thereby repelled, as in the foregoing experiments; and appear as lucid, diverging beams, like tho&s;e which, in the dark, we &s;ee &s;treaming from electrified points.</P>
<P>THIS hypothe&s;is might indeed &s;olve the phaenomena of the cometic tails, provided the electric atmo&s;pheres or bodies, charged with that fluid, were vi&s;ible in any of our experiments, even when made in the dark: But as that is never the ca&s;e, unle&s;s the fluid be in mo|tion; and as the proof of the exi&s;tence of &s;uch atmo&s;|pheres, when at re&s;t, depends &s;olely upon their effects upon other &s;ub&s;tances, the hypothe&s;is can|not be admitted. Were this indeed the <HI>true</HI> and <HI>&s;ole</HI> cau&s;e of the phaenomena, a Planet, near which a Comet might happen to pa&s;s, would be in a &s;ituation, truly hazardous; for it is evident that the Planets (upon that &s;uppo&s;ition) are not accommodated with &s;uch va&s;t electric atmo&s;pheres as attend the Comets; con&s;equently, have not the &s;ame proportion of that fluid conden&s;ed round them, but far &s;hort of it:&mdash; Therefore, whenever the electric tail of a Comet pa&s;&s;ed near a Planet, it would be attracted by <HI>it,</HI> be drawn a&s;ide, from its oppo&s;ition to the Sun, towards <HI>it,</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="012498_0031_0F8A8EE712435E88">and upon <HI>it</HI> di&s;charge the <HI>&s;urplu&s;&s;age</HI> of its fire, that both might have equal, or proportional &s;hares; which di&s;charge, if we con&s;ider the &s;nap of a &s;mall &s;park be|tween two cork pellets, and enlarge the idea, propor|tionably, to that in&s;tantaneous cataract of fire which would nece&s;&s;arily take place between two Worlds in &s;imilar &s;ituations, we may well imagine would give an explo&s;ion, which nothing could equal, &s;hort of the final voice of an archangel; and, if it were not &s;uffi|cient to rou&s;e the a&s;hes of the dead, might reduce the living to their primitive du&s;t. But &s;uch a cata&s;trophe, we have not the lea&s;t rea&s;on to dread, from the neigh|bourhood of a Comet, unle&s;s we can &s;uppo&s;e, that in|finite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s would create one world, merely for the de&s;truction of another; as we cannot conceive of any other ends, to which &s;uch huge electrical atmo&s;pheres could be adapted. Indeed the di&s;charge would be equally fatal to both worlds; as it is certain from electrical experiments, that the ef|fects of a &s;troke of lightning are the &s;ame, whether the fla&s;h proceeds from the cloud to the Earth, or is di&s;charged from the Earth into the cloud, both of which have happened during the &s;ame thunder-gu&s;t; as appears from ob&s;ervations made by Mr. <HI>Kinner&s;ly</HI> and Doctor <HI>Franklin,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Franklin</HI>'s Letter, page 116 and 12<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> communicated to the Royal Society. But to put this matter beyond all rea&s;onable doubt, we may further ob&s;erve, that if the phaenome|na of Comet's tails aro&s;e from the &s;ame cau&s;e, which renders the electric &s;tream vi&s;ible, when proceeding from a &s;teel point, the&s;e tails would &s;hine by their own light, as the electric fluid does, when in motion; whereas, an apparent ob&s;curation or defect, in one of

<P>AS the con&s;ideration of the properties of the electric element was introduced, merely, to <HI>illu&s;trate</HI> the &s;eve|ral propo&s;itions, and the conclu&s;ions re&s;ulting from them, contained in the foregoing pages; it was thought proper to add thus much upon that &s;ubject, in order to prevent the framing an hypothe&s;is from tho&s;e properties, which, in&s;tead of removing the fears of the timorous, upon the appearance of a Comet, (which was one de&s;ign of this e&s;&s;ay,) would naturally tend to increa&s;e their apprehen&s;ions.

<HEAD>ESSAY ON COMETS. PART II.</HEAD>
<P>AS ancient geographers imagined the polar and equatorial regions, or the frigid and torrid zones of the earth, were uninhabitable, in con&s;equence of the extremes of heat and cold, to which tho&s;e climates are expo&s;ed: So, modern a&s;tronomers have pa&s;&s;ed a &s;imilar judgment upon the &s;uperior and inferior Planets, e&s;pecially on <HI>Saturn</HI> and <HI>Mercury;</HI> concluding, that our water would always boil upon the latter, and be frozen upon the former; and that merely in con&s;equence of their different di&s;tances from the Sun<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Newt. Princip. Book III. Prop. VIII. Cor. 4.</NOTE>. Whence it has been naturally concluded, that the textures of their various fluids, and of their inhabitants, to who&s;e u&s;es the&s;e fluids are adapted, are very different from what they are found to be upon our Earth: And, con&s;idering the near ap|proaches of mo&s;t Comets <HI>to,</HI> and the va&s;t elongations of all their orbits <HI>from</HI> the Sun, it has been generally
<PB N="52" REF="012498_0033_0F8A8EE893A77E80">&s;uppo&s;ed, that no material race of beings could &s;ub&s;i&s;t under &s;uch amazing vici&s;&s;itudes of heat and cold, as tho&s;e bodies mu&s;t, from their different &s;ituations, ne|ce&s;&s;arily be expo&s;ed to; con&s;equently that they are uninhabited.</P>
<P>BUT the conclu&s;ivene&s;s of this rea&s;oning depends upon the truth of the following Propo&s;ition; ad|vanced indeed by Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton;</HI> but not &s;upported by experiments, which were, with him, the <HI>criterion veritatis;</HI> viz. that, <Q><HI>The heat of the Sun is as the den&s;ity of his rays, that is reciprocally as the &s;quares of the di&s;tances from the Sun.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Princip. under Prop.

<P>HERE, we are again reduced to the di&s;agreeable nece&s;&s;ity, of di&s;&s;enting from the opinion of the greate&s;t GENIUS that ever dignified human rea&s;on; which, con&s;idering the ju&s;tly celebrated fame of that illu&s;tri|ous author, may be &s;tigmatized as ignorance or vanity: But it is hoped that the reader will wave that imputation, if he &s;hall judge, upon the whole, that Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI> him&s;elf would have altered his opinion, upon the evidence which we &s;hall produce in &s;upport of the contrary po&s;ition: We may, however, lay down this as a maxim, that, in the pro&s;ecution of any &s;cience, the progre&s;s of the mind mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be retarded, in proportion to the <HI>implicit</HI> a&s;&s;ent we give to the de|ci&s;ions of any man, however great. We &s;hall there|fore, without further apology, endeavour to prove that the heat of the Sun, as perceived by us, and as di&s;|coverable by its effects upon other &s;ub&s;tances expo&s;ed to his rays, does not depend upon the den&s;ity of tho&s;e

<P>IN the mean time, before we engage in the di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion of planetary heat, as depending upon the &s;eve|ral di&s;tances of the Planets from the Sun; it may throw &s;ome light upon this &s;ubject if we con&s;ider the portion of that heat which falls to our own &s;hare, and the di&s;tribution of it throughout the various climates of the Earth.</P>
<P>THE &s;urface of the Earth has, by geographers, been divided into five zones, viz. one <HI>torrid,</HI> including all the regions between the tropics, upon every part of which the Sun &s;hines perpendicularly twice every year: Two <HI>frigid,</HI> which are &s;ituated between the polar-circles and the poles, and endure the rigors of perpetual winter, as the former is always ba&s;king in a &s;ummer Sun: And two <HI>temperate,</HI> which experience the vici&s;&s;i|tudes of winter and &s;ummer, and, in &s;ome parts of them, in their extremes; the&s;e are &s;ituated between the <HI>frigid</HI> and <HI>torrid</HI> zones, in both hemi&s;pheres. In the fir&s;t of the&s;e, the &s;ea&s;ons are much more uniform than in the others, the days and nights being nearly of equal lengths, the year round; and although the heat may, for a con&s;tancy, be greater therein than in any other climate, yet it is not liable to &s;uch great and &s;udden changes as are experienced in the temperate

<P><HI>AIR</HI> is a grand medium in nature, through which an all-bountiful providence conveys to us many of the conveniences, comforts, and delights of life.

SIR <HI>I.

WE are now naturally led to con&s;ider &s;ome exten|&s;ive purpo&s;es which the great Author of Nature pro|bably had in view, when he formed the atmo&s;pheres of, and annexed them to, the &s;everal Planets and Comets of our Sy&s;tem. We have &s;een from indi&s;pu|table authority, that the den&s;ity of the Sun's rays alone does not produce a competency of heat, for the com|fortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tance of the inhabitants of the Earth, even in its hotte&s;t climates, but, that a certain den&s;ity of air is equally nece&s;&s;ary, for the&s;e rays to operate upon, and to co-operate with them, in promoting the various purpo&s;es of life and vegetation. This air we are abundantly furni&s;hed with from the atmo&s;phere which &s;urrounds us, the den&s;ity of which at every height, is proportional to the pre&s;&s;ure of the incum|bent fluid. We may conclude from analogy that the atmo&s;pheres of the other Planets, and of the Comets, are de&s;igned for, and adapted to the &s;ame purpo&s;es for which the atmo&s;phere of the Earth was originally pro|vided: And if we &s;uppo&s;e the general &s;tock of heat, which falls to the &s;hare of any Planet, to be in a ratio compounded of the den&s;ity of the Sun's rays and the den&s;ity of the air upon the &s;urface of the Planet, it is ea&s;y to conceive, that the&s;e globes may be &s;everally furni&s;hed with &s;uch atmo&s;pheres, as may render them comfortable habitations, whatever their di&s;tances from the Sun may be. That the heat of the Sun is actually thus di&s;pen&s;ed to the Planets nece&s;&s;arily follows from the experiments and ob&s;ervations contained in the foregoing pages, upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that they are &s;urrounded with aerial atmo&s;pheres, &s;uited to their &s;e|veral di&s;tances from the Sun; that they have &s;uch at|mo&s;pheres is already proved, and the Creator, has,
<PB N="68" REF="012498_0041_0F8A8EF302256870">doubtle&s;s wi&s;ely proportioned their re&s;pective quanti|ties and den&s;ities according to tho&s;e di&s;tances.</P>
<P>THE <HI>tails</HI> of Comets are nothing more than expan|&s;ions of their atmo&s;pheres, who&s;e lengths depend upon their nearne&s;s to the Sun (as before ob&s;erved) and de|crea&s;e as they recede from the Sun, becoming invi&s;ible to us (generally) before their <HI>heads</HI> di&s;appear: There|fore we have the highe&s;t rea&s;on to conclude that when the&s;e globes are in the mo&s;t remote parts of their or|bits, or at their aphelia, their tails wholly &s;ub&s;ide, and their atmo&s;pheres re&s;ume &s;pherical forms, like tho&s;e of the Earth and of the other Planets, &s;urrounding their nuclei at equal altitudes in every part; the Sun's at|mo&s;phere being too remote to have any &s;en&s;ible effect upon them by its repellency. The air mu&s;t of con|&s;equence be prodigiou&s;ly den&s;e near the &s;urfaces of their globes, being compre&s;&s;ed by the weight of &s;uch a va&s;t incumbent fluid; whereby the Sun's rays, though weaker, or le&s;s den&s;e than with us in the ratio of the &s;quares of the di&s;tances, may, upon our principles, be rendered as active with them, and as productive of &s;uch degrees of heat as are nece&s;&s;ary for the purpo&s;es of animal and vegetable life, as with us, or any other Planet of the Sy&s;tem.</P>
<P>BUT, (as was ob&s;erved by Doctor <HI>William&s;on,</HI>) &s;hould the&s;e atmo&s;pheres continue of the &s;ame den&s;ity, through all parts of their orbits, the degrees of heat which their inhabitants mu&s;t undergo at their peri|helia would be un&s;ufferable: To prevent which, the great Author of Nature has made &s;ufficient provi&s;ion; for as they approach the Sun, they are by the repul&s;ion of his atmo&s;phere (or &s;ome other cau&s;e equivalent to &s;uch &s;uppo&s;ed repul&s;ion) gradually ea&s;ed of that incumbrance,
<PB N="69" REF="012498_0041_0F8A8EF302256870">the cometic atmo&s;phere being gradually rarefied and driven behind its body through va&s;t &s;paces of the Heavens; what remains from time to time being more and more rarefied by the increa&s;ing action of the Sun's rays upon it, and repelled as rarefied; till at length, if they come near enough to the Sun, the inhabitants may have little more than pure aether to breathe in. Thus the Comet of 1769, (than which but few have gone nearer to the Sun) before it ar|rived at its perihelion, although it projected a mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing tail, yet the remaining atmo&s;phere was den&s;e enough to hide the nucleus it &s;urrounded; the Comet, when viewed through the be&s;t tele&s;copes, pre|&s;enting only a dubiou&s;ly defined luminous appearance: But when it made its re-appearance in the evening about the latter end of <HI>October,</HI> its atmo&s;phere had undergone &s;o great a degree or rarefaction in pa&s;&s;ing its perihelion, that it was &s;ufficiently pellucid to di&s;|cover the nucleus, which appeared plainly and di&s;|tinctly through it.</P>
<P>MAY we not then conclude, even with certainty, that as a Comet is perpetually varying its di&s;tance from the Sun, &s;o the den&s;ity of its atmo&s;phere is con|tinually changing through the various &s;tages of its revolution; and thence, that its inhabitants may at all times enjoy as much benefit, and receive as little injury, from the Sun's rays, as the inhabitants of any other Planet in the &s;olar Sy&s;tem?</P>
<P>AS the primary Planets revolve in orbits nearly cir|cular, they have no occa&s;ion for &s;uch va&s;t atmo&s;pheres as are nece&s;&s;ary for the Comets in the remote regions of the Heavens to which they retire; but are &s;ur|rounded

1. IT may be objected, that, as the <HI>light</HI> of the Sun is confe&s;&s;edly proportional to the den&s;ity of his rays, that is inver&s;ely as the &s;quares of the di&s;tances from the Sun, the inconveniencies ari&s;ing therefrom to the inhabitants of the Comets, at their <HI>perihelia</HI> and <HI>aphelia,</HI> might be nearly as great as tho&s;e which would ari&s;e from the Sun's <HI>heat</HI> were it di&s;tributed in the &s;ame pro|portion; or at lea&s;t, if it did not render the Comets uninhabitable, would make the conditions of their in|habitants, at times very uncomfortable. For example, were the light of the Sun adapted to their various pur|po&s;es, at their <HI>mean di&s;tances,</HI> at their <HI>aphelia,</HI> they might not enjoy a &s;ufficiency; and on the contrary at their <HI>perihelia,</HI> the &s;plendor would be un&s;ufferable.</P>
<P>THIS objection, it is pre&s;umed will vani&s;h upon a careful attention to the &s;tructure of the eyes of terre&s;trial animals, who&s;e pupils contract or dilate involuntarily, according as the den&s;ity of the rays which pa&s;s thro' them and fall upon their retinas is greater or le&s;s, whereby more or fewer of tho&s;e rays are admitted, as may be re|qui&s;ite for di&s;tinct, inoffen&s;ive vi&s;ion: Thus mo&s;t per|&s;ons can &s;ee to read by candle light near as well as by day light, whereas the quantities of light reflected from objects in the two ca&s;es &s;carely bear any pro|portion one to the other. But the aperture of the pu|pil is much greater in the former than in the latter, and more rays in proportion are con&s;equently admitted. Moreover, there are &s;ome animals with us which re|tire to their holes and caves at the approach of day, who&s;e purpo&s;es are as well an&s;wered by the glimmer|ing
<PB N="72" REF="012498_0043_0F8A8EF3D39394D8">light of the Stars, as tho&s;e of others are by the pre&s;ence of the Sun; there are yet others which can behold the Sun in his meridian &s;plendor, without of|fence. Now if we only &s;uppo&s;e that the inhabitants of Comets in general have, in the original formation of their optic organs, the power of contracting and dilating their pupils, according to the &s;trength or weakne&s;s of the light which is tran&s;mitted through them, we may ea&s;ily conceive, that the rays of the Sun might be no more offen&s;ive to them at one time than at another; for at their aphelia their pupils might be dilated to their utmo&s;t extent; on the other hand, at their perihelia, they might be contracted to phy&s;ical points, if the &s;plendor of the Sun &s;o required, whereby a proportionally &s;maller quantity would be admitted.</P>
<P>THE light of the Sun which the Cometarians enjoy at their aphelia is indeed much greater than we &s;hould be apt to imagine; for let us con&s;ider the Comet of 1680, who&s;e period is the longe&s;t and its aphelion di&s;tance the greate&s;t of any one known, being (according to Dr. <HI>Halley</HI>) to the mean di&s;tance of the Earth from the Sun nearly as 138 to 1; but from the rea&s;oning of Doctor <HI>Smith,</HI> in his optics it appears, that the pro|portion of our day light to moon light with a full moon, is nearly as 90000 to 1;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smith's Opticks, Vol. 1. Page 29.</NOTE> and the light of the Sun upon the Comet at its la&s;t mentioned &s;tage is to his light with us but as about 1 to 19000, therefore if we divide 90000 by 19000 we &s;hall find that Moon|light with us is to Sun-light upon the Comet, nearly as 1 to 4&frac34;, and con&s;equently that the light of the Sun
<PB N="73" REF="012498_0043_0F8A8EF3D39394D8">enjoyed by the inhabitants of that Comet at its aphe|lion is nearly five times as great as the light of our full Moon. But it is &s;till much greater upon account of the largene&s;s and den&s;ity of the atmo&s;phere; for it is certain, that our day light, which is equally diffu|&s;ed upon all terre&s;trial objects, and renders them vi|&s;ible; depends upon the reflection of the Sun's rays, from the atmo&s;phere, together with the hete|rogeneous corpu&s;cles floating in it; without which all &s;uch objects would be as ob&s;cure as at midnight, even with the Sun &s;hining in full &s;plendor above the hori|zon; excepting tho&s;e upon which the direct rays of the Sun might fall, or &s;uch as might be faintly illumi|minated by the reflection of tho&s;e rays from neigh|bouring objects: The Heavens would appear perfectly black, and the &s;malle&s;t Stars would appear, at noon|day, which is prevented, only, by the illumination of the atmo&s;phere. The beautiful azure, which we ob|&s;erve in the Sky, after the atmo&s;phere is purged of its vapors, by a &s;torm or thunder-gu&s;t, ari&s;es from the appearance of this black Sky, through the air, which is now become more tran&s;parent, than when charged with a heterogeneous collection of opaque corpu&s;cles.</P>
<P>THE atmo&s;pheres of Comets, being much larger and den&s;er than that of the Earth, reflect a much greater proportion of the Sun's rays; their hemi&s;pheres next the Sun mu&s;t therefore be more illuminated, and their day light increa&s;ed, in the &s;ame proportion; although the light ari&s;ing from the direct rays of the Sun would be con&s;iderably weakened thereby.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="012498_0044_0F8A8EF49605DCF8">
THIS rea&s;oning may be illu&s;trated by calling to mind the effects of two great ecliples of the Sun, one of which happened on the 5th or 6th day of Augu&s;t, 1766; the other on the 19th day of January, 1768; which effects, mo&s;t per&s;ons among us, who&s;e attention was turned that way, may recollect; during the for|mer the air was very clear, and the &s;ky cloathed in a fine blue, excepting, here and there, where a few &s;um|mer clouds were &s;cattered: In the mid&s;t of this eclip&s;e the air was darkened to &s;uch a degree, that, although the Sun &s;hone unclouded, a &s;ickly gloom &s;eemed to &s;pread over the face of nature. In the latter, (though a much greater eclip&s;e) the air was full of vapors, the reflection of the Sun's rays from which was &s;o copious, as to render it offen&s;ive to the eyes to look at the Heavens, before the eclip&s;e began, and in the middle of it, the darkne&s;s occa&s;ioned thereby would &s;carcely have been noticed, had not the eclip&s;e been known beforehand.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants of Comets enjoy another advan|tage from their great atmo&s;pheres, which is peculiar to them alone; for, in the hemi&s;phere turned from the Sun, they can have no dark nights like tho&s;e of the Planets; but, in con&s;equence of the reflection of the Sun's rays from tho&s;e atmo&s;pheres, mu&s;t be fa|voured with perpetual twilight if not day light; for a cometic atmo&s;phere is enlightened by the Sun by night as well as by day, excepting only a column, which is nearly cylindrical at the aphelion, who&s;e ba&s;e is a great circle of the Comet, and who&s;e altitude is equal to the height of the atmo&s;phere; which, (con&s;idering the
<PB N="75" REF="012498_0044_0F8A8EF49605DCF8">great extent of the latter,) bears but a &s;mall propor|tion to the whole atmo&s;pheric hemi&s;phere; this column includes that part of the atmo&s;phere which is eclip&s;ed by the &s;hadow of the globe it&s;elf, and, if the diameter of the atmo&s;phere is equal to ten diameters of the globe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Page 14.</NOTE>, does not contain <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">th part of the whole vi&s;i|&s;ible hemi&s;phere; and is &s;till le&s;s upon account of the refraction of the Sun's rays, which &s;hortens and con|tracts the cone of the &s;hadow. Whence it is probable that the darke&s;t nights of the Cometarians, at their aphelia, are much lighter than our brighte&s;t moon|light nights. But this is &s;ubmitted to the judgment of the reader.</P>
<P N="2">2. IT may further be objected; that if the atmo&s;|pheres of Comets undergo &s;uch amazing, rarefactions and conden&s;ations, as they nece&s;&s;arily mu&s;t, from the alternate projections and retractions of their tails, it is difficult to conceive that they can at all times be fit for the re&s;piration of their &s;uppo&s;ed inhabitants.</P>
<P>THIS objection might, perhaps, have remained un|an&s;werable, had it not been for the genius of that truly great philo&s;opher Doctor <HI>Edmund Halley;</HI> who, if he was not the original inventor of the <HI>diving-bell,</HI> yet, by a &s;agacity peculiar to him&s;elf, improved it to a de|gree of perfection, which might, before, have rather been wi&s;hed for, than expected.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Jones's Abridgment of Philos. Trans. Vol. IV. Page 188, and onward.</NOTE> In this <HI>bell</HI> per&s;ons may be let down with &s;afety to the bottom of the &s;ea; but the included air differs in den&s;ity at every depth below the &s;urface of the water. At the depth of
<PB N="76" REF="012498_0045_0F8A8EF54D631020">thirty-two or thirty-three feet, as the air may occa|&s;ionally change, or le&s;s, in proportion as &s;alt water is heavier than fre&s;h, the den&s;ity of the air within the bell is double the den&s;ity of the external air; at double that depth the den&s;ity is triple; at three times, four|fold, and &s;o on. Now if the bell be let down without proper precaution, the too &s;udden conden&s;ation of the air within, would give the adventurers extreme pain, as they &s;ometimes found by experience; and &s;hould the bell &s;ink &s;uddenly to the bottom of the &s;ea, the con&s;equence might be fatal to them; for the &s;ame rea&s;on that a &s;quare ca&s;e-bottle, filled only with com|mon air above the &s;urface of the water, and corked tight, if it were let down with the divers in the bell, would from the increa&s;ing pre&s;&s;ure of the conden&s;ing air without it, be cru&s;hed inwards, and broken in pieces, in the &s;ame manner as if the air in the bottle had been exhau&s;ted by an Air-Pump above the &s;ur|face of the water; which effect would be prevented by the &s;malle&s;t hole in the cork, provided the bell were let down lei&s;urely, &s;o that the air as it conden&s;ed without, might gradually in&s;inuate it&s;elf through the hole into the bottle: On the contrary were the bottle corked at the bottom of the &s;ea, and the bell drawn up from the depth of nine or ten fathoms; before the bell could arrive at the &s;urface of the water, the bot|tle would bur&s;t outwards, from the expan&s;ive force of the conden&s;ed air within it; which might al&s;o be prevented by a &s;imilar precaution. And it is doubt|le&s;s from the latter cau&s;e that &s;ome per&s;ons who have a&s;cended to the tops of high mountains, have been &s;eized with reachings, vomitings and other inconve|niences
<PB N="77" REF="012498_0045_0F8A8EF54D631020">related by travellers; the external air of the atmo&s;phere at &s;uch heights being too rare to counter|act by its pre&s;&s;ure, the expan&s;ive force of the den&s;er air which is inter&s;per&s;ed throughout the various ve&s;&s;els and organs of animal bodies.</P>
<P>BUT Doctor <HI>Halley</HI> te&s;tifies from his own experience, that <Q>if the diving-bell be let down (or drawn up) gradually, about twelve feet at a time with an in|terval of but a few minutes between, no inconve|nience would follow</Q>; as the &s;everal organs of the body would by degrees be inured to the den&s;ity of the air, as it increa&s;ed or decrea&s;ed at the &s;everal depths. The Doctor tells us, that he him&s;elf was hours toge|ther at the bottom of the &s;ea in nine or ten fathoms of water; and felt him&s;elf as well as if he had been all the time on board the &s;hip: But the den&s;ity of the air he then breathed, mu&s;t have been more than three times as great as that of the air above the &s;urface of the water: In other words, he then breathed in air, compre&s;&s;ed by the weight of between three and four of our atmo&s;pheres in&s;tead of one, and of ten or a dozen &s;uch as <HI>Don de Ulloa</HI> breathed in, when upon the tops of the mountains of <HI>Quito,</HI> without any inconvenience. Therefore, if time &s;ufficient be allowed for the air, in|cluded in the &s;everal ve&s;&s;els of the human body, gra|dually to contract, expand or otherwi&s;e accommodate it&s;elf, to the increa&s;ing or decrea&s;ing den&s;ity of the exterior air; no bad con&s;equences or even inconve|niencies are to be apprehended, although the difference of den&s;ity be exceeding great.</P>
<P>BUT by the gradual and regular approach of any Comet to, or rece&s;s from its perihelion, (at and near which its
<PB N="78" REF="012498_0046_0F8A8EF611B8AEA0">velocity is greate&s;t and the con&s;equent changes in its atmo&s;phere are mo&s;t &s;udden of all) the increa&s;e or decrea&s;e of its atmo&s;phere, is much more regular, uniform, and in&s;en&s;ible to its inhabitants, than any increa&s;e or decrea&s;e of the den&s;ity of the air can be in the diving bell by Doctor <HI>Halley</HI>'s method; for by the latter, a degree of rarefaction, or conden&s;ation, is effected in a few minutes, which might not take place in the cometary atmo&s;pheres under &s;ome days.</P>
<P>PERHAPS enough has been already &s;aid to remove every material objection; but if any difficulties yet remain, in the mind of the reader, on account of the va&s;t changes which the &s;everal climates in each, and the atmo&s;pheres of all Comets mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily under|go, in the various parts of their orbits: the following additional ob&s;ervations are &s;ubmitted to his con&s;ide|ration; which may tend to le&s;&s;en tho&s;e difficulties, if they do not wholly remove them, viz.</P>
<P>AS a Comet approaches its perihelion, that hemi&s;|phere of its atmo&s;phere which is next to the Sun, be|ing more immediately expo&s;ed to his rays, will feel the effects of his neighbourhood &s;ooner than the oppo&s;ite hemi&s;phere, and con&s;equently will be warmed, rarefied, and thrown off behind the Comet by the repul&s;ion of the Sun's atmo&s;phere, &s;ooner than the other; the colder and den&s;er parts of the fluid will of cour&s;e continually flow in from the other &s;ide of the Comet to &s;upply its place, in order to pre&s;erve, as near as may be, an equilibrium; in con&s;equence of which there will be a con&s;tant &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of the cooler air from thence; whereby the inhabitants on the hemi&s;phere next the Sun may be
<PB N="79" REF="012498_0046_0F8A8EF611B8AEA0">continually refre&s;hed with gales of wind during that vicinity, which would increa&s;e till the Comet arrived at its perihelion, when their velocity would be greate&s;t of all; but even then they would not (from this cau&s;e) blow in &s;udden violent gu&s;ts like our hurricanes, but &s;teadily, unle&s;s di&s;turbed by cau&s;es from within the Comet's atmo&s;phere; be&s;ides, as the velocity of the current increa&s;ed, the den|&s;ity of the fluid would le&s;&s;en from the increa&s;ing rarefaction, whereby its momentum might continue nearly the &s;ame; for this momentum would be in a ratio compounded of the velocity of the fluid and its den&s;ity together; and as the violence of our high winds, and their con&s;equent effects depend, not upon the velocity, merely, but upon the momentum of the current, this bri&s;k circulation of the cometic air may, (however great we &s;uppo&s;e its velocity) be rather grate|ful than injurious to the <HI>Cometarians:</HI> And how unfit &s;oever the air in &s;uch a rarefied &s;tate might be for their u&s;e, if &s;tagnant, yet, when thus put in motion, it may be rendered &s;ufficiently active to an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es of re&s;piration. This rea&s;oning is confirmed by daily experience: For it is not an uncommon thing for people of tender frames to faint in a clo&s;e hot and rarefied air; and as the fan is generally near at hand, it is as common for the by-&s;tanders to apply it to their faces, which, by giving a bri&s;k motion to the air, without any alteration of its den&s;ity, generally revives them, in a &s;hort time, even when no other remedy is at hand.&mdash; This bri&s;k motion of the air would al&s;o remove or pre|vent the di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ations of heat which the
<PB N="80" REF="012498_0047_0F8A8EF6CB46A090"><HI>cometary</HI> inhabitants might otherwi&s;e &s;uffer from an expo&s;ure to the Sun's rays at their perihelia: For, if a per&s;on &s;it with his face uncovered before the &s;corching blaze of a common fire, the motion of the air excited by a common fan, even without hiding the blaze from the face, is &s;ufficient, not only to make the &s;ituation comfortable, but to change the painful &s;en&s;ation to an agreeable coolne&s;s: As any one will find upon trial.</P>
<P>IF we &s;uppo&s;e that every Comet has a diurnal ro|tation round an axis of its own, the inhabitants may enjoy grateful vici&s;&s;itudes, from the alternate ab|&s;ence and pre&s;ence of the Sun; and if we further &s;uppo&s;e this diurnal motion to be performed contrary to its apparent heliocentric motion; the returns of day and night would be quickened as it approached the Sun, from the increa&s;e of its angular velocity round that globe, whereby the pre&s;ence of the Sun, in that neighbourhood, would be of &s;horter duration, upon any one part of the Comet, and his heat might be rendered &s;till le&s;s irk&s;ome to the inhabitants, on that account. It is true, no di&s;covery has been made of any &s;uch diurnal motion, but as all the primary Planets, &s;o far as our ob&s;ervations can reach, are di&s;|covered to have &s;uch motions, we may well be allowed to &s;uppo&s;e that the Comets are not without them; e&s;pe|cially now we are endeavouring to prove their habi|tability, to which this motion is perhaps as nece&s;&s;ary as to the habitability of the primary Planets. The&s;e rotations have been already di&s;covered and determined in <HI>Venus,</HI> the <HI>Earth, Mars</HI> and <HI>Jupiter. Saturn,</HI> though a va&s;t globe in it&s;elf, is &s;o remote, and <HI>Mercury</HI> is &s;o near the Sun, and &s;o very &s;mall, that this motion has
<PB N="81" REF="012498_0047_0F8A8EF6CB46A090">never been di&s;covered in either, by our be&s;t in&s;tru|ments, but is ju&s;tly inferred by analogy; which me|thod of rea&s;oning will equally extend to the Comets of the Sy&s;tem. The diurnal motions of the Planets indeed are performed nearly in the &s;ame directions with their annual, both motions in all, as far as they have been di&s;covered, being direct, or from We&s;t to Ea&s;t, whereas the diurnal motions of Comets, accord|ing to the foregoing &s;uppo&s;ition, are performed con|trary to this rule: But this is no objection again&s;t the hypothe&s;is; for Planets and Comets differ as widely, in almo&s;t every other particular; the annual motions of the former (as now ob&s;erved,) are all direct, and are apparently confined within the limits of the zodiac, the latter move indifferently in all directions through the Heavens; the periodical revolutions of the former are made in orbits nearly circular, tho&s;e of the latter are prodigiou&s;ly excentric, and nearly para|bolical; all which &s;eem wi&s;ely to be ordered, that a multitude of Worlds may exi&s;t at the &s;ame time, and be enlightened, warmed, and rendered prolific, by the rays of the &s;ame Sun, without interfering in their mo|tions, or di&s;turbing the harmony of the Sy&s;tem.</P>

<P><Q>ONE of the primary ideas we form of the &s;upreme Being is, that he is the &s;ource of life, intelli|gence and happine&s;s, and delights to communicate them; the Earth we tread, the water we drink, and the very air in which we breathe, &s;warm with living
<PB N="84" REF="012498_0049_0F8A8EF92181CA10">creatures, all fitted to their &s;everal habitations.&mdash;Are we to &s;uppo&s;e that this little globe is the only animated part of the creation, while the Comets, many of which are larger worlds, and run a nobler cour&s;e, are an idle chaos, formed for the &s;ole pur|po&s;e of being frozen and burnt in turns?&mdash;We cannot admit the thought; the Comets are doubt|le&s;s inhabited.</Q></P>

<P>IF we &s;uppo&s;e all the &s;olid globes of the &s;olar Sy&s;tem to be annihilated, their atmmo&s;pheres remaining; the power of gravity, which had theretofore con|den&s;ed them round their re&s;pective orbs, cea&s;ing, they would immediately expand them&s;elves <HI>quaquaver&s;um,</HI> in con&s;equence of the mutual repellency of their par|ticles, till the whole &s;pace in which the bodies of the Sy&s;tem had revolved, was equally filled with the fluid, and when its den&s;ity became equal in every part, the whole world be at re&s;t.</P>
<P>SO, <HI>vice ver&s;a,</HI> if we &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch a fluid, to have been the fir&s;t material &s;ub&s;tance in the order of crea|tion, equally diffu&s;ed, in that rarefied &s;tate, through|out the mundane &s;pace; next after it, the &s;everal ma&s;&s;es of the Sun, Planets and Comets, nearly about the &s;ame time with each other: This fluid, though its particles are in a &s;tate of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> repul&s;ion, yet as they are in the common &s;tate of gravitation to the other bodies of the Sy&s;tem, would be attracted by the &s;eve|ral globes, every particle moving towards that globe, which &s;hould have the balance of attraction in its favour.</P>
<P><HI>Mercury</HI>'s atmo&s;phere, by rea&s;on of its neighbour|hood to the Sun, and the &s;mallne&s;s of his globe would be lea&s;t of all and very incon&s;iderable: For &s;uppo&s;e a right line A B. &Merc;A&mdash;D&mdash;B&Sun; drawn from the center of the Sun to the center of <HI>Mercury,</HI> to be &s;o divided in D, that the part next the Sun may be to the part next <HI>Mercury</HI> in the &s;ub-duplicate ratio of the quantity of matter in the
<PB N="86" REF="012498_0052_0F8A904A972264D0">Sun to the quantity of matter in <HI>Mercury;</HI> every particle between D and B would de&s;cend to, and be conden&s;ed round the Sun, and tho&s;e only be|tween D and A to <HI>Mercury;</HI> and it appears by computation that DB : DA :: 3693 : 1 nearly, and in all oblique directions the particles, who&s;e di&s;tances from the Sun and Mercury were proportionably greater or &s;maller, would de&s;cend to, and conden&s;e round one or the other; unle&s;s drawn a&s;ide by &s;ome other Planet: What is here &s;aid of <HI>Mercury,</HI> is equally applicable to the other Planets; and as the attraction of the Sun is va&s;tly greater than the united attractions of all the Planets together; &s;o, in every part of the Sy&s;tem, where the attractive power of the Sun might be greater than that of any neighbouring Planet; the fluid oc|cupying that part of the &s;pace, would de&s;cend and join the Sun's atmo&s;phere; while the re&s;t would be con|tinually conden&s;ing round the Planets, till at length the &s;everal globes would be accommodated with their proper atmo&s;pheres; when the Heavens would be left a perfect vacuum for the various bodies to revolve in, without the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>IF the Comets be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been created and projected in their &s;everal orbits, at their aphelia, or at their greate&s;t di&s;tances from the Sun, it may be ea&s;y upon this hypothe&s;is to account for their having at|mo&s;pheres &s;o much exceeding tho&s;e of the Planets in their dimen&s;ions, for providence has &s;o ordered it, that the angles of the inclinations of their orbits to the eclyptic and to each other are generally very great, and their motions are directed to all parts of the Heavens indi&s;criminately, whereby their di&s;tances from the Planets and from each other at their aphelia,
<PB N="87" REF="012498_0052_0F8A904A972264D0">are great beyond human conception; con&s;equently they were at liberty to &s;hare among&s;t them&s;elves, with|out any mole&s;tation from the Planets, all that part of the fluid, which filled the va&s;t &s;paces of the Sy&s;tem, without the planetary regions; therefore if the hypo|the&s;is be granted, they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have &s;uch at|mo&s;pheres, as, in fact, we find they have, and which, in their de&s;cent through the planetary &s;pheres, are, by the (&s;uppo&s;ed) repul&s;ion of the Sun's atmo&s;phere, driven to &s;uch a&s;toni&s;hing di&s;tances behind them, as occa&s;ion may require. Tho&s;e who&s;e aphelion di&s;|tances were greate&s;t, being more &s;olitary, would con|den&s;e round them the greate&s;t atmo&s;pheres, and &s;uch, their greater di&s;tances from the Sun would require, upon the foregoing principles, to make them comfor|table habitations. As the lengths of their tails would probably, at equal di&s;tances from the Sun, be propor|tional to the quantities of this repellent matter contain|ed in their atmo&s;pheres re&s;pectively, it may not be impo&s;&s;ible to form a rational conjecture of their real aphelion di&s;tances, by ob&s;erving the apparent lengths of their tails, when at equal di&s;tances from the Sun, in their de&s;cent, and thence computing their real lengths, and comparing tho&s;e who&s;e aphelion di&s;tances are unknown with tho&s;e which are already determined; and as nearly as we can by this method come at their greate&s;t di&s;tances from the Sun, &s;o nearly may we (by comparing their computed trajectories, with tho&s;e di&s;tances,) determine their mean di&s;tances and periodic revolutions. But this is humbly &s;ubmitted to better judges, and is de&s;igned only as a hint for future inquiries.</P>
