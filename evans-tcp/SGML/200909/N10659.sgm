<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THERE is great Engagedne&s;s, in the&s;e Colonies, to cultivate PSALMODY; and I believe it to be the Duty of Chri&s;ti|ans to learn the Songs of Zion, accor|ding to good Method or Rule; but the People ought not to be contented with the outward Form of Singing, but &s;hould &s;eek after the <HI>inward</HI> Part:&mdash;There are two Parts of Singing as St. Paul informs us, in 1 Cor. 14.15. <HI>(I will &s;ing with the</HI> Spirit, <HI>and I will &s;ing with the</HI> Under&s;tanding <HI>al&s;o.)</HI> To &s;ing without the Spirit, (though with good Method) is like the Sound of a mu&s;ical In&s;trument without Life. To &s;ing with the Spirit, I under&s;tand Paul further to mean, to &s;ing with &s;piritual Matter: And thus when we &s;ing with the Under&s;tanding or Method, and with &s;piritual Matter, by the Influence of God's Spirit, we &s;ing agreeable to God's Mind. St. Paul exhorts, in Col. 3.16. <HI>Let the Word of Chri&s;t dwell in you richly in all Wi&s;dom; teaching and admoni&s;hing one another in P&s;alms and Hymns, and &s;piritual Songs, &s;inging with Grace in your Hearts to the Lord.</HI> The Songs of Zion, when they are &s;ung with the Spirit of the Go&s;pel, are very comforting, refre&s;hing, and edifying to the Chil|dren of God&mdash;convincing to a carnal Wold&mdash;well-plea&s;ing

to God, and de&s;tructive to the Kingdom of Satan. And it being a good Work, I am wil|ling to contribute &s;omething towards promoting it. For this End I have taken no &s;mall Pains to col|lect a Number of choice Hymns, P&s;alms, and &s;piritual Songs, from a Number of Authors of dif|ferent Denominations of Chri&s;tians, that every Chri&s;tian may be &s;uited. I have, in the fir&s;t Place, cho&s;e out &s;ome awakening and mo&s;t alarm|ing Hymns, next to them penitential, then invi|ting, and then con&s;olating Hymns, and the la&s;t Part contains Hymns of the Birth, Death, Re&s;ur|rection and A&s;cen&s;ion of Chri&s;t, and his Appea|rance in the la&s;t Great Day. The&s;e Hymns are in various Metres, and e&s;pecially the la&s;t Part are of uncommon Mea&s;ures, for new Tunes and new Singers.</P>
<P>Here I pre&s;ent you, O Chri&s;tians, of what De|nomination &s;oever, with cordial Hymns, to com|fort you in your weary Pilgrimage; I hope they will a&s;&s;i&s;t and &s;trengthen you through the various Changes of this Life, till you &s;hall all &s;afely arrive to the general A&s;&s;embly Above, and Church of the Fir&s;t-Born, where you &s;hall have no more need of the&s;e imperfect Hymns; but &s;hall per|fectly join the Songs of Mo&s;es and the Lamb; where all your imperfect Services &s;hall forever be at an End; and you &s;hall have open and full Vi&s;ion and Fruition of GOD and the LAMB; where you &s;hall &s;it down in perfect Harmony with Abraham, I&s;aac and Jacob, and with all the Saints and Angels in the New-Jeru&s;alem; where all Sorrow, Grief, Trouble and Pain &s;hall forever cea&s;e, and all Tears wiped away from your Eyes.</P>
