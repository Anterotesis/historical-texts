<P>She was one, who in her Childhood, was much afflicted with weak Eyes, which made her unfit for the u&s;ual Employment of Girls; and being of a large natural Capacity, quick, witty, and &s;tudiou&s;ly inclined, her Father brought her up to more Learning, than is commonly be&s;towed upon our Sex; in which &s;he became &s;o good a Proficient, that &s;he well under&s;tood the <HI>Latin Tongue,</HI> fluently di&s;cour|&s;ed in it; and made a con&s;iderable Progre&s;s in <HI>Greek</HI> al&s;o; wrote &s;everal Hands well; was a good <HI>Arithmetician,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">P&s;al. 90.11.</NOTE> yea in the be&s;t Arithmetick; <HI>for &s;he &s;o num|bered her Days, as to apply her Heart unto Wi&s;|dom;</HI> as al&s;o to the Study of &s;everal u&s;eful Arts; had a good Under&s;tanding of Phy&s;ick and Chirurgery, the Nature of Plants, Herbs, and Minerals; and made &s;ome In&s;pection in|to divers profitable Sciences, delighting in the Study of Nature, and to admire the great God of Nature, in the various Operations of his Power and Goodne&s;s, the wonderful Har|mony and Order of the Creation, and the in|finite Wi&s;dom by which it is govern'd; of

She was one who loved the Ble&s;&s;ed Truth (and they who walk|ed according to it) from a Child, being ear|ly convinced thereof; tho' &s;he was not &s;atis|fiyed with a bare Profe&s;&s;ion of Religion, but zealous for the Life of it, both in her &s;elf and others; al&s;o furni&s;hed with good Argu|ments to defend it, being ready to give an An&s;wer to every one that asked <HI>a Rea&s;on of the Hope which was in her,</HI> with Meekne&s;s and Fear: Not forward to begin a Di&s;pute, yet &s;ound in what the undertook, and never (that I know of) foil'd in an Argument; for &s;he had an Eye to the Lord, and liked to be &s;a|tisfied

<P>Nor was &s;he proud, or conceited of her Parts and Learning, but adorned with an humble Mode&s;ty; having, I believe, meaner Thoughts of her &s;elf, than any one el&s;e had of her, who knew her Qualifications.</P>
<P>Plain and decent in her Cloaths, which &s;he valued for Service more than Sight; and &s;lighted in Compari&s;on of tho&s;e better Or|naments of the Mind, which &s;he preferr'd above &s;plendid or co&s;tly Apparel.</P>
<P>She was one who loved to read the Holy Scriptures, and &s;uch u&s;eful Authors, as had a Tendency to Improvement; in which &s;he &s;pent much Time: God having furni&s;hed her with an extraordinary Memory, to retain the &s;ame.</P>
<P>She delighted much in Solitude, and was often alone; &s;etting apart &s;ome Time of the Day for Retirement; and would frequently &s;ay to me, in the Evenings, <HI>Let us go a&s;ide, and wait upon the Lord; we have daily need of daily Bread, and to renew our Strength; and how can we expect it, if we do not wait for it?</HI> and would recite the Pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Elijah,</HI> 1 Kings

She was one who willingly and chearfully &s;ufferted for the Truth, encomaging others to do the like, both by Precept and Example: One ju&s;t, hone&s;t, and true to her Word, tem|perate and &s;elt-denying; keeping within the Limits pre&s;cribed for Health, which &s;he re|garded, more than to gratify a luxurious Ap|petite; &s;olid and grave in her Carriage, mixt with an innocent Chearfulne&s;s; not formal|ly au&s;tere; yet rather re&s;erved, than over|free; ba&s;hful, than bold.</P>

But what I have written, is from an expe|rimental Knowledge of her; and no one, I believe, knew her better than my &s;elf: For &s;he was as much without Re&s;erve to me, I think, as one Friend could be to another for we loved entirely, communicated ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Minds and Exerci&s;es to each other freely advi&s;ing with one another on mo&s;t Occa&s;i|ons: And great was our Nearne&s;s and Uni|ty of the Spirit, in the Truth; yea, great her Concern for my Welfare, which &s;he zea lou&s;ly labour'd for; as the many Letters, both in Ver&s;e and Pro&s;e, to me writ, and here with printed, largely demon&s;trates.</P>

<P>And tho' living Te&s;timonies to the Truth are numerous, yet few extant in Ver&s;e, which hath an harmonious delighting Faculty in it, that influences the Minds of &s;ome more than Pro&s;e, e&s;pecially young People, and is more apt to imprint it felt in the Memory: Therefore, her Subject being divine, and &s;o &s;en&s;ibly and &s;olidly managed; as it hath been of Service to tho&s;e few who have had the Peru&s;al of it, &s;o, I hope, will be attended with a General Benefit.</P>

<HEAD>A Te&s;timony concerning my dear Friend, <HI>Mary Molineux.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AS concerning my dearly beloved Friend, <HI>Mary Molineux,</HI> I have more to te&s;tify, than I &s;hall commit to Writing, having had intimate Acquaintance and Fellow&s;hip with her above Sixteen Years; in all which Time, her grave, vertuous mode&s;t Life and Conver|&s;ation, de&s;erveth &s;ingular Remembrance; be|cau&s;e and Deportment, was always &s;olid &s;en&s;ible, and tender, mixt with a feeling and &s;ympathizing Love to her Friends, in all Exerci&s;es and Afflictions: She was one to whom I could freely impart my Mind and Concerns, in any Exerci&s;es; as I often have done, to my Comfort and Refre&s;hment. My
<PB REF="003191_0008_0FF01692AC669F78">Heart is moved, in the Remembrance of her Faithfulne&s;s and Integrity, from the Day that I was fir&s;t acquainted with her, with Sorrow for the Lo&s;s of &s;o near a Friend; who, al|tho' &s;he was plentifully endued with many worthy Gifts and Parts, both natural and Spiritual, yet I never knew her <HI>lifted up</HI> in any of them, nor <HI>exalted above her Mea&s;ure;</HI> but rather re&s;erved than in any wi&s;e forwardly divulging her Gifts to the publick Cen&s;ure, without weighty Con&s;ideration; &s;o that &s;he would not ca&s;t her Pearls before Swine: Yet not &s;o much re&s;erved, but that to her near intimate Friends, whom &s;he knew in the Fellow&s;hip and Bond of Truth, &s;he was very free and tender. I remember, that &s;everal Years ago, when &s;he was a &s;ingle Woman, upon the Peru&s;al of &s;ome Copies of her Ver|&s;es, which &s;he gave me, I felt &s;uch Unity of Spirit with them, that I &s;aid, I thought they might be of Service, if made publick in Print; but &s;he was not then free, that her Name &s;hould be expo&s;ed; &s;he not &s;eeking Prai&s;e among&s;t Men, but to communicate the Exerci&s;e of peculiar Gifts among&s;t her near Friends and Acquaintance: But now, &s;ince it hath plea&s;ed the Lord to remove her out of the Earthly Tabernacle, into Everla&s;ting Re&s;t, in which, I am well &s;atisfied, &s;he is for ever ble&s;&s;ed, I think it would be ungrate|ful to her Memory, and al&s;o a wronging of

<HEAD>A <HI>Te&s;timony</HI> concerning my late Wife, <HI>Mary Mollineux</HI> decea&s;ed.</HEAD>
<P>COncerning my dear, loving, and late de|cea&s;ed Wife, <HI>Mary Mollineux,</HI> formerly <HI>Mary Southworth,</HI> whom I took in Marriage on the 10th Day of the 2d Month, 1685. I was fir&s;t acquainted with her at <HI>Lanca&s;ter-Ca&s;tle,</HI> where we both, at one Time, were Pri&s;oners for being at peaceable religious Meetings of the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> in the Year 1684, (tho' we had &s;een each other before.) In which Impri&s;onment, I believed that &s;he &s;hould be my Wife; but never intended to expre&s;s any thing thereof, whil&s;t we were both Pri&s;oners, there; and after &s;he was relea&s;ed, I &s;aw her and was in Company with her &s;everal Times, before I expre&s;&s;ed any thing of my Concern to take her to be my Wife; &s;everal con&s;ide|rable Men having before attempted to prevail with her on that Account: And during the whole Time of my Acquaintance with her, which was above Eleven Years; her Life and
<PB REF="003191_0010_0FF01697A23A19A8">Conver&s;ation was &s;erious, innocent, &s;weet and &s;avoury; and &s;he was very loving, diligent, ten|der-hearted, and kindly affectionate towards me and our Children; and generally loving and tender towards all People, e&s;pecially &s;uch as were in any Di&s;tre&s;s, Sickne&s;s, or Affliction, tho' never &s;o poor; and the Lord ble&s;&s;ed her En|deavours, as well in Advice, as Admini&s;tra|tion of Remedies, to &s;everal; &s;o that they have acknowledged their Recoveries to have been thereby, thro' his Ble&s;&s;ing: And what &s;he did therein, was free. She was very care|ful, that nothing of Evil might get a Place in her Children, or in any with whom &s;he was concerned: And therefore good Advice and Admonition &s;he frequently gave, which many received in Love and good E&s;teem of her. The Lord opened her Under&s;tanding, and enlarged her Capacity, in a great Degree, upon &s;everal Accounts; yet her Mind was not lifted up thereby, &s;o as to glory in her Gifts or Parts; but, learning of Chri&s;t the Truth, to be <HI>lowly in Heart,</HI> &s;he cho&s;e rather to appear little to Men. She was very con|&s;tant and cordial to her Friends, and true in concealing of Secrets. She was often con|cerned to make Peace among&s;t them that were at Difference, and often prevailed therein. She was plain and free in &s;peaking to the Faces of any, but abhorred to reproach any in &s;ecret. Her Heart was inclined towards
<PB REF="003191_0010_0FF01697A23A19A8">God, therefore &s;he was ju&s;t in her Dealing with all People, with whom &s;he had to do. She was convinced of the Way of Truth in her Youth, by the Light or inward Appea|rance of Chri&s;t in her Heart, which &s;he lo|ved; and therefore (&s;he retaining her In|tegrity to the End of her Time) a Crown of endle&s;s Life and Glory, I believe, the Lord hath be&s;towed upon her. She was very no|ble in &s;uffering Per&s;ecution for the Te&s;timo|ny of Truth, and in enduring hard Exerci|&s;es, occa&s;ioned by my &s;everal Impri&s;onments for the &s;ame Cau&s;e, whil&s;t &s;he was my Wife. And thro' &s;everal Sickne&s;&s;es and Afflictions the Lord &s;upported her, to per&s;evere in Pa|tience, Faithfulne&s;s, and Con&s;tancy to him. She was very punctual in Performance of her Undertakings, and quick, di&s;creet and diligent in her Bu&s;ine&s;s; yet &s;till &s;he u&s;ed to take a Time for private Retirement in Evenings alone, (except I was with her) to wait upon, and feel after the Lord, in the Gift of his Light, Love and Grace in her Heart; and to &s;ee that, with the wi&s;e Vir|gins, &s;he had Oyl in her Burning Lamp, that it might not go out; but that &s;he might be ready to enter into the Marriage-Chamber, when&s;oever the Lord, the Bride|groom of her Soul, came. She was al&s;o very diligent, in attending the A&s;&s;emblies of the People of God, called <HI>Quakers,</HI> with
<PB REF="003191_0011_0FF0169A045B0168">them, to meet in the Name, Power, Light and Spirit of the Lord, to wait upon him, to be opened by him, and to receive Re|fre&s;hment, Strength and Comfort from him, and to feel the Renewings of his Love and Goodne&s;s in her Soul. And that Day-week next before her la&s;t Illne&s;s &s;eized her (after a more than u&s;ual Manner) &s;he &s;aid to me, <HI>That the feeling and enjoying of the &s;weet eternal Love of God in her Heart, was more precious to her, than all other things that could be enjoyed, &amp;c.</HI> She was concerned in her Spirit, that many, with her, and all that are faithful to God, might <HI>come</HI> to <HI>ta&s;te and &s;ee how good the Lord is;</HI> and upon that Account, her Words, Writings, and Conver&s;ation, were acceptable, prevalent and &s;erviceable, to the Invitation, Convincement, Strengthning and Encourage|ment of &s;ome to &s;eek after the Lord, and his blei&s;ed Way and Truth, inwardly re|vealed, and to be revealed; wherein many have found great Satisfaction, and Cau&s;e of rejoycing. And that many more may receive Benefit by her Writings, I am de&s;irous and concerned to publi&s;h them, and refer all &s;o|ber Readers, in the Fear of God, to peru&s;e them; not doubting but &s;uch may receive Advantage thereby; tho' &s;he was not free to commit them to publick View in her Life-Time, yet &s;he had nothing again&s;t the publi&s;hing thereof afterwards.</P>

<P>Upon the Eighth Day of the 10th Month, 1695. &s;he was &s;eized with violent Pain and Sickne&s;s, which continued, &s;ometimes more, and &s;ometimes le&s;s: And one Morning, &s;oon after, &s;he &s;aid to me thus; <HI>I have had &s;uch a Dream, as I have &s;eldom had; it is an Emblem of my Life;</HI> and then &s;he told it me thus; viz. <HI>She dreamed, that &s;he was going at the Side of a plea&s;ant broad River, and &s;ometimes &s;he came to Breaches; which, Brooks running into the River, or the like, had made upon the Shore of it; which Breaches &s;he pa&s;&s;ed over, but &s;ometimes with Difficulty, and then ran fa&s;t on &s;till, till &s;he came to another Breach; and having pa&s;&s;ed &s;eve|ral Breaches, &s;ome greater, and &s;ome le&s;&s;er, at la&s;t &s;he came to a Breach which was greater than any of the re&s;t, and &s;he &s;aid within her &s;elf, How &s;hall I get over this Breach? But &s;he went on, and pa&s;&s;ed thro' it, and it was fair on the other Side; and &s;he awaked.</HI> Now, as &s;he looked upon this Dream to be an Emblem of her Life, &s;o I cannot (nor could not &s;ince &s;he told it me) expound it otherwi&s;e than thus; <HI>viz.</HI> That
<PB REF="003191_0012_0FF0169D3518D1B8">the plea&s;ant broad River &s;ignified the Lord her Creator, (who is to his People <HI>a Place of broad Rivers,</HI> I&s;a. 31.21.) and the Shore thereof, upon which &s;he walked, &s;ignified Time, and the Breaches, which &s;he pa&s;&s;ed over, were the Difficulties and Afflictions which &s;he pa&s;&s;ed thro' in her Time; and the la&s;t and greate&s;t Breach, which &s;he came to, and pa&s;&s;ed over, &s;ignified her la&s;t Sickne&s;s and Death. From which Dream (as a &s;ignificant Parable) all may learn and con&s;ider how fa&s;t they are ha&s;tning or run|ning towards their la&s;t and greate&s;t Breach; even the Death or Di&s;&s;olution of their earth|ly Tabernacles; and none knoweth how near they are to it. About Nine Days after her &s;aid Illne&s;s began, &s;he &s;aid to me thus, viz. <HI>I am well content, if the Lord &s;ee meet, that he take me away by this Di&s;temper, rather to be in this Pain; for my Pain is great, and I know not what is in this World I can de&s;ire, to &s;tay to enjoy, except it is my Love, and my little Lads;</HI> meaning me, and our two Children. Of whom &s;he then &s;aid thus, <HI>I would rather have my Children en|riched with the Fear of the Lord, than with all Manner of Worldly Riches.</HI> About the &s;ame Time, &s;he &s;aid, <HI>I am thinking of hone&s;t</HI> Rich|ard John&s;on, (who was a near Friend to us) <HI>that &s;lept much of the Time of his Illne&s;s, before his Departure; methinks it &s;eemeth like an ea&s;ie Pa&s;&s;age.</HI> And &s;oon after that, &s;he began to
<PB REF="003191_0012_0FF0169D3518D1B8">be inclind to Sleepine&s;s, and &s;lept more and more, till the End; yet, at her awaking, was &s;till &s;en&s;ible and chearful: And tho' &s;he was daily weaker and weaker, yet &s;he would &s;till &s;it up five or &s;ix, or more Hours in the E|venings, and di&s;cour&s;e freely and chearfully, till within five Days of her Departure. I often de&s;ired her to to accept of the Advice of &s;ome Phy&s;itian, but &s;he was &s;till aver&s;e thereto, in this Illne&s;s, tho' in others &s;he had complied. On the 20th Day of her Ill|ne&s;s, in the Evening, di&s;cour&s;ing very freely (as formerly) &s;he told me, <HI>She was well &s;a|tisfied, that if the Lord took her away by that Di&s;temper, &s;he &s;hould be eternally Happy;</HI> with many other &s;en&s;ible and comfortable Expre&s;|&s;ions: Tho' &s;he was &s;o weak, that the &s;ame Evening, about the eleventh Hour, I thought &s;he had been departing; but in a little Time, recovering her Breath, &s;he &s;poke chearfully and &s;lept. At her awaking, that Night, I asked her, How &s;he was? She an&s;wered, <HI>Thro' Mercy, indifferent.</HI> And after a little Pau&s;e, &s;he very &s;en&s;ibly &s;aid, <HI>Amictum iri, vet Amiciendum e&s;&s;e;</HI> which is in <HI>Engli&s;h, To be cloathed hereafter,</HI> in two Expre&s;&s;ions of it: Whereby I under&s;tood, that &s;he was mind|ing, how the Lord would cloath her here|after, when her Mortal Cloathing was put off. Then I de&s;ired her in Engli&s;h Words, (for they that were pre&s;ent, under&s;tood not
<PB REF="003191_0013_0FF0169ED29BF638"><HI>Latin,</HI>) that if &s;he had any thing in her Mind, either concerning her Children, or any other Thing farther to communicate to me, that &s;he would do it; but &s;he, (as if all outward Things were then out of her Thoughts) quickly replied in <HI>Latin, Why &s;peake&s;t thou &s;uch Things? Do&s;t not thou under&s;tand me?</HI> I an&s;wer|ed in <HI>Latin, Yes, I very well under&s;tand thee, and that thou &s;peake&s;t of Spiritual Things:</HI> She an&s;wered, <HI>Yes, but &s;he had nothing concerning outward Things, farther to communicate to me.</HI> The next Morning, about the Ninth Hour, I again thought &s;he had been departing; but after a little Time, &s;omewhat recover|ing her Breath, and &s;eeing me expre&s;s, to Friends that were pre&s;ent, &s;omething or my Concern for her, &s;he &s;aid to me, <HI>Ne nimis &s;olicitus e&s;to;</HI> that is, in <HI>Engli&s;h, Be not thou overmuch careful,</HI> or <HI>troubled;</HI> which Advice took Impre&s;&s;ion in my Heart: And that was the la&s;t <HI>Latin</HI> Sentence that &s;he &s;pake, that I know of; and &s;he never &s;pake in <HI>Latin,</HI> in this Illne&s;s, that I remember, except when Company was pre&s;ent, that &s;he would &s;peak only to me? A little after, mo&s;t of the Company being gone out, I asked her, how &s;he was? She an&s;wered, <HI>Drawing nearer and nearer.</HI> And many &s;weet and loving Senten|ces &s;he &s;pake to me that Day, and the Day next after; but afterwards was &s;carcely able to an&s;wer to any Que&s;tion, but continued
<PB REF="003191_0013_0FF0169ED29BF638">mo&s;tly &s;leeping, as it were, &s;weetly and qui|etly: And on the Third Day of the 11th Month, 1695, in the Evening, &s;he departed, without any Noi&s;e, Sigh, or Groan.</P>
<P>And &s;o, tho' the Lord, who in his Love, joyned us together, and gave us for Ble&s;&s;ings to each other, and ble&s;&s;ed us with the abun|dant Increa&s;e of his Love in our Hearts, even to the end of her Time, hath &s;een meet to take from me her Company, which I valu|ed above all other Temporal Enjoyments; the Lo&s;s whereof is great to me: Yet being &s;a|tisfied, that &s;he is entred into Re&s;t, in the Bo&s;om of God's Love, with him, to live in Peace and Happine&s;s for ever; and al&s;o, be|ing clear, in that, thro' his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, ac|cording to the Under&s;tanding given me, I have endeavoured fully to di&s;charge my Duty of endeared Love to her in every re&s;pect, in her la&s;t (as well as former) Exerci&s;es; there|fore I am, in the Love of God, comforted, and can chearfully and freely &s;ay, The Lord's Will is worthy to be done in all things, and his Name to be ble&s;&s;ed, prai&s;ed and magni|ted, over all, for ever,</P>

<L>Of endle&s;s Glory, and rejoyce to &s;ing</L>
<L>Melodious Songs of Prai&s;e to <HI>Sion</HI>'s King?</L>
<L>Should then this World's inferiour Trifles be</L>
<L>Of &s;uch Regard, as to prevail with thee</L>
<L>To look a&s;ide: Ah! nay; for thou ha&s;t learn'd</L>
<L>To pa&s;s by all her Triumphs unconcern'd.</L>
<L>Now therefore, per&s;evere, my worthy Friend,</L>
<L>In that where Friend&s;hip never knoweth end.</L>
