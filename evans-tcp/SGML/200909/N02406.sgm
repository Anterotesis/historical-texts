<P>THE late &s;urpri&s;ing and awful <HI>Event</HI> of Provi|dence wherein the <HI>mo&s;t High GOD</HI> hath pa&s;|&s;ed before us, in an amazing <HI>Earthquake,</HI> of va&s;t <HI>extent</HI> and in a <HI>degree</HI> of uncommon ter|ror; whether we con&s;ider the greatne&s;s of the <HI>Shock,</HI> or the great <HI>noi&s;e</HI> that attended it; is the occa&s;ion of <HI>publi&s;hing</HI> the following <HI>Sermons,</HI> tho' not of the <HI>preach|ing</HI> them all.</P>
<P>For within the <HI>month</HI> wherein the <HI>earthquake</HI> came I had preached <HI>twice</HI> to my People from this awful <HI>Subject, The Judgments of Providence in the hand of CHRIST:</HI> to which I added <HI>three</HI> Sermons more, in a proper and &s;erious <HI>Application</HI> of the Subject to &s;o &s;ingular and uncommon a <HI>Providence;</HI> wherein I have con&s;ider'd the <HI>Earthquake in the hand of CHRIST,</HI> and what <HI>his voice to us</HI> is in that teaching and affecting Di&s;pen&s;ation. The&s;e <HI>five</HI> Sermons I have here re|duced into <HI>three,</HI> only pointing the <HI>Reader</HI> where he may divide the contracted <HI>double</HI> Sermons, for the u&s;e and benefit of his hou&s;hold.</P>
<P>It is only the <HI>Chri&s;tian Improvement</HI> of this awak|ning Providence that I have here attended to, and the <HI>Reader</HI> is de&s;ired to expect no other; leaving the Enquiry into the <HI>natural Cau&s;es</HI> of Earthquakes, and the <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> of them, to a <HI>better Hand,</HI> which has pro|mis'd to gratify the <HI>Publick</HI> therewith.</P>
<P>Something of the <HI>Scriptural hi&s;tory</HI> of the <HI>Earthquake</HI> is here given, and the peculiar honour of the&s;e <HI>Di&s;|cour&s;es</HI> is their &s;incere Aim to render unto CHRIST the glory of this tremendous <HI>Judgment,</HI> and of our <HI>Pre&s;ervation</HI> in it.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="002853_0004_0FE67810CED7E958">
To HIM therefore let the&s;e <HI>Meditations</HI> be &s;acred (however mean and unworthy to be offer'd to his glorious <HI>Name</HI>) according to the Commandment and declared Will of the FATHER to us, Who <HI>hath com|mitted all judgment to the SON, that all men &s;hould honour the Son even as they honour the father.</HI></P>
<P>Our LORD has vi&s;ited us this year as he told <HI>Ariel,</HI> the City where <HI>David</HI> dwelt, that it &s;hould be <HI>vi&s;ited of the LORD of ho&s;ts with Thunder, and with Earthquake, and with great Noi&s;e; with Storm and Tem|pe&s;t, and the flame of devouring Fire.</HI></P>
<P>The great noi&s;e of <HI>thunder</HI> we have often heard, I hope with trembling and godly fear, as <HI>Elihu</HI> did in his day. And we have &s;carce ever heard more of it in a <HI>&s;ummer,</HI> than in this which is now pa&s;t. But we never heard <HI>the great noi&s;e of an Earthquake</HI> till in the late <HI>calm and &s;till night,</HI> when it came ru&s;hing and roaring on us in hollow &s;ubterraneous <HI>thunders,</HI> the be&s;t and true&s;t Compari&s;on I can make of it.</P>
<P>As for <HI>the flame of devouring fire</HI> we had very much of it in the &s;ultry and parching extream <HI>heat</HI> of the &s;ummer, of a long continuance, for many weeks to|gether. This <HI>burning drought</HI> penetrated far into the earth, &s;o that many wells and &s;prings of water fail'd that never had before. Some have been ready to ask, Whether <HI>this</HI> might contribute any thing, as a natural cau&s;e in the hand of CHRIST, to the Earth|quake that has follow'd upon the rains and cold of <HI>Autumn,</HI> which &s;uddenly &s;et in after &s;o uncommon and long a <HI>heat?</HI> But when we &s;earch (as I think we mu&s;t) <HI>very deep</HI> after the probable natural Cau&s;e of &s;o <HI>great</HI> a &s;hake, I am con&s;trained to drop this burning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> on the <HI>&s;urface,</HI> had it been more than it was.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this <HI>&s;ultry</HI> heat, and in the <HI>Evening</HI> after a very <HI>parching</HI> day, (<HI>Augu&s;t.</HI> 1.) the Heavens broke out into a continued <HI>blaze</HI> of flame and <HI>roar</HI> of thunder, horrible to behold and hear, for two or three hours together. The <HI>fla&s;hes</HI> of lightning were almo&s;t
<PB N="v" REF="002853_0005_0FE64683A0EFB3A0">without intermi&s;&s;ion, and con&s;equently the <HI>peal</HI> of thunder perpetual in our ears; As if <HI>the heavens being on fire were di&s;&s;olving and pa&s;&s;ing away with a great noi&s;e, and the earth al&s;o with its works were to be burnt up.</HI> Yet the lightning did little or no hurt that I heard of.</P>
<P><HI>Forty &s;ix</HI> days after this, namely on the 16th. of <HI>Sep|tember,</HI> the &s;ame <HI>Almighty power</HI> in like maje&s;ty and terror came down to us in the <HI>whirlwind</HI> and in the <HI>&s;torm,</HI> and the <HI>clouds were the du&s;t of his feet; He made darkne&s;s his &s;ecret place, his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.</HI> The furious <HI>wind</HI> &s;hiver'd the mighty <HI>oaks</HI> and the &s;trong <HI>elms,</HI> tore off their va&s;t <HI>branches</HI> as a man plucks a <HI>twig</HI> with his hand, and turn'd up the wide <HI>roots</HI> of innumerable trees with all their <HI>turf</HI> cleaving to them into the air; a new and &s;trange <HI>&s;pectacle</HI> of de&s;olation in the fields and woods. Yet it pleas'd GOD again to pre&s;erve our dwellings and our lives that tempe&s;tuous day and night; Only a family or two &s;uffer'd by lo&s;s of <HI>life</HI> or broken <HI>bones,</HI> who had the due and hearty Sympathy of their &s;pared nei'bours.</P>
<P>And now that after all <HI>this flame, thunder and tempe&s;t,</HI> at the end of <HI>forty three</HI> days more, <HI>October.</HI> 29. we &s;hould be vi&s;ited with a tremendous <HI>Earthquake,</HI> has fill'd the year with &s;o many remarkable <HI>threatnings of judgment</HI> as were never known among us before in &s;o &s;hort a compa&s;s of time. Truly the LORD has pa&s;&s;ed by in the <HI>great and &s;trong wind,</HI> in the <HI>flame</HI> and <HI>earth|quake;</HI> and what &s;hould follow but <HI>his &s;mall and &s;till voice</HI> in his preached Word? if we might be &s;o happy and honoured of him as to interpret his <HI>Providences</HI> aright, and bring his mind and will in &s;uch a clear and &s;trong light, as by the ble&s;&s;ing of the HOLY SPIRIT to make &s;utable and &s;aving impre&s;&s;ions upon our &s;ouls.</P>
<P>There is but one <HI>doub,</HI> in a way of <HI>Speculation,</HI> that I would here propo&s;e, and in a few words offer to re|&s;olve: namely,</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="002853_0006_0FE64683B32D74A8">
Whence might it come to pa&s;s, that the late <HI>&s;hock</HI> of the Earth was <HI>felt,</HI> and the <HI>noi&s;e</HI> or roar of the earth <HI>heard,</HI> in all the very <HI>di&s;tant</HI> places to which it reach'd, &s;o far as we can yet learn, <HI>at</HI> or very near <HI>the &s;ame moment of time?</HI></P>
<P>I &s;ee not how <HI>this</HI> can be accounted for, but by &s;up|po&s;ing the <HI>whole Shake</HI> to come from <HI>one &s;ingle bla&s;t</HI> or &s;troke, in &s;ome mighty <HI>Cavern</HI> at a va&s;t <HI>depth</HI> in the earth: Where let us &s;uppo&s;e a va&s;t body of prepared <HI>&s;ulphurious matter,</HI> like that from whence the <HI>lightnings and thunders</HI> in our air proceed; or if you plea&s;e com|pare it to that prodigious preparation of man on earth <HI>Gun-powder:</HI> Let us imagine a <HI>quantity</HI> hereof &s;uffici|ent to &s;hake a <HI>Circle</HI> of our Earth of <HI>five hundred miles diameter;</HI> which I take to be much <HI>within</HI> the mea|&s;ure of the <HI>Circle</HI> &s;haken by our late Earthquake, which reach'd from our mo&s;t <HI>northern</HI> bounds as far &s;outhward as <HI>Philadelphia:</HI> Say now that this prodigi|ous quantity of prepared &s;ulphureous matter <HI>take fire</HI> all at once, and <HI>blow up,</HI> tearing to pieces a va&s;t part of the <HI>Intrails</HI> of the earth, but chiefly di&s;charging it &s;elf into the mighty <HI>Deep</HI> below, while at the &s;ame time it mu&s;t al&s;o &s;trike dreadfully <HI>upwards,</HI> and <HI>heave</HI> at once the earth of &s;uch a circle as is before named, and &s;et it all a <HI>trembling</HI> near the &s;ame in&s;tant of time: But then in the <HI>extremities</HI> of the Circle the <HI>&s;hake</HI> will naturally be <HI>le&s;s,</HI> and toward the <HI>center</HI> of it more; and the <HI>noi&s;e</HI> of the bla&s;t below will naturally <HI>accompany</HI> the &s;hock it gives, and be <HI>heard</HI> every where in that in&s;tant that the &s;hake is <HI>felt,</HI> and in <HI>proportion</HI> to the &s;hock the noi&s;e will be in one place and another.</P>
<P>This is my plain and &s;hort <HI>rea&s;oning</HI> upon the point, and I am glad to find I am <HI>not alone</HI> in it; &s;uppo&s;ing the <HI>Letter from Marblehead</HI> to mean the &s;ame thing, when it &s;ays, <Q>I am ready to conclude that the &s;hocks were <HI>general</HI> and at the <HI>&s;ame</HI> time, and that <HI>their direction was from beneath upwards, and not along the &s;urface of the earth.</HI></Q> That this <HI>opinion</HI> is right
<PB N="vii" REF="002853_0007_0FE677E61B9E8E80">&s;eems very evident from the nature of the thing. For both the <HI>&s;hock</HI> and <HI>&s;ound</HI> being almo&s;t at the <HI>&s;ame</HI> time in <HI>every</HI> place, where it was felt or heard at all, "the <HI>direction</HI> mu&s;t be from <HI>beneath</HI> upwards, and not along the <HI>&s;urface</HI> of the earth, as our <HI>&s;en&s;es</HI> at the time would have per&s;waded us.</P>
<P>And accordingly in the <HI>extremity</HI> of the Circle &s;ha|ken, for in&s;tance at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> the &s;hake and rumble we hear was but <HI>&s;mall.</HI> Moreover, In <HI>proportion</HI> to the va&s;t Circle &s;haken, I conclude we mu&s;t conceive of the <HI>depth</HI> below where the <HI>blow</HI> was given; and al|&s;o of the <HI>force</HI> of the blow it &s;elf, as well as of the va&s;t <HI>quantity</HI> of matter'<HI>fir'd</HI> and blown up: For a &s;hake of &s;uch <HI>dimen&s;ion</HI> and to &s;uch a <HI>degree,</HI> is mo&s;t ea&s;ily accounted for from a <HI>fiery bla&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Every <HI>Generation,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e, may look for Earth|quakes in this <HI>Continent;</HI> and in every <HI>Century</HI> &s;ome very <HI>great</HI> &s;hocks may be rea&s;onably expected. <HI>Sixty five</HI> years are now pa&s;&s;ing &s;ince the Land was &s;hook much as it was now: The <HI>pewter</HI> fell off the &s;helves, the <HI>joice</HI> wro't in and out of the mortices as the hou&s;es rock'd, the <HI>lids</HI> of warming-pans were flung up; <HI>pa&s;|&s;engers</HI> on the way were unable to keep their feet and &s;at down while the ground <HI>heav'd</HI> them: Something al&s;o of the like noi&s;e and <HI>rore</HI> of the earth accompani|ed <HI>that</HI> &s;hake.</P>
<P>Many <HI>&s;maller</HI> &s;hakes have been felt &s;ince. <HI>Greater</HI> and more dreadful ones may be expected, as the <HI>Coun|try</HI> fills more with <HI>&s;in.</HI> For the <HI>Great GOD</HI> fore&s;ees all the <HI>Events of nature</HI> in its cour&s;e, and the <HI>Sins of places</HI> and people in their cour&s;e and increa&s;e; and in his mo&s;t wi&s;e and ju&s;t <HI>Government</HI> of the World they exactly <HI>tally</HI> one with the other, to his infinite glory and ever|la&s;ting prai&s;e from the <HI>Intellectual</HI> world.</P>
<P>We may conceive that every &s;uch <HI>bla&s;t</HI> from within the bowels of the Earth, very much <HI>thins the cru&s;t</HI> be|tween the <HI>&s;urface</HI> whereon we live and the <HI>Aby&s;&s;e</HI> of fire below. And the more <HI>this</HI> is &s;hatter'd and <HI>broken</HI> by
<PB N="viii" REF="002853_0008_0FE64685972402E0">bla&s;ts within, the nearer is the <HI>&s;inking</HI> of the earth, and the <HI>eruption</HI> of fire, here and there, by &s;hakes that are to come: The &s;hakes that are <HI>&s;till</HI> felt in divers places, with the rumbling noi&s;e accompanying them, &s;eem to me to proceed from the <HI>fall</HI> of certain huge <HI>pieces</HI> of the earth, which the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> great &s;hake had loo&s;ned, and the furious <HI>flames</HI> have &s;ince prey'd on and torn down. By all of which <HI>they</HI> gain more and more upwards. At the Contemplation of the&s;e things our <HI>fle&s;h</HI> may well <HI>tremble becau&s;e of GOD,</HI> and we &s;hould be <HI>afraid of his judgments.</HI></P>
<P>The vi&s;itation by <HI>Earthquakes</HI> this year &s;eems direct|ed more e&s;pecially to <HI>Great Britain</HI> and its <HI>Dominions.</HI> The accounts from thence tell us of <HI>Earthquakes</HI> there the la&s;t <HI>July,</HI><Q>preceeded by a <HI>mighty noi&s;e</HI> like thun|der at a di&s;tance; the hou&s;es &s;hook, the walls of gardens rock'd like a cradle, the tops of &s;everal chim|neys fell; many left their hou&s;es in great fear think|ing them falling on 'em, and others were to&s;s'd in their beds.</Q> What the <HI>import</HI> of the&s;e things may be to a &s;inful (otherwi&s;e happy) <HI>Kingdom,</HI> and to the&s;e <HI>Provinces;</HI> Whether our holy <HI>Prote&s;tant Religion</HI> or our <HI>Civil Liberties</HI> are to be &s;haken; as GOD only knows, &s;o may He avert the <HI>Omen.</HI> Our part is <HI>to make &s;up|plication to our Judge.</HI></P>
<P>To be &s;ure the great <HI>Mercy</HI> of GOD to us in our <HI>Pre&s;ervation</HI> ought greatly to <HI>affect</HI> us, and never be forgotten. I have endeavoured to give <HI>this</HI> a due place and con&s;ideration in the following <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e;</HI> and the <HI>Subject</HI> naturally led to it, the <HI>Judgment</HI> and the <HI>Sal|vation</HI> coming from the &s;ame hand of our <HI>Lord Redeemer.</HI></P>
<P>That <HI>He may &s;anctify</HI> to us all his Di&s;pen&s;ations, every <HI>Mercy</HI> and every <HI>Judgment,</HI> and ble&s;s this <HI>humble Offering</HI> to that <HI>&s;aving</HI> effect, is the <HI>Prayer</HI> of the un|worthy <HI>Author.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Judgments of Providence in the hand of CHRIST.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>Ezekiel X. 2.</HI></BIBL>
<P>And he &s;pake unto the Man clothed with linnen, and &s;aid, Go in between the Wheels, even under the Cherub, and fill thy hand with coals of fire from between the Cherubims, and &s;catter them over the City: And he went in in my &s;ight.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>FOR the under&s;tanding the&s;e <HI>dark</HI> and <HI>awful</HI> words we mu&s;t know, 1. who the <HI>Man</HI> is here &s;poken to, <HI>clothed with linnen;</HI> 2. <HI>who</HI> &s;peaks to him; and then 3. con&s;ider the meaning of the <HI>thing</HI> commanded him and done by him.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Man</HI> here &s;poken unto, <HI>clothed with linnen,</HI> is no other than the Man CHRIST JESUS; the eternal <HI>Son of God</HI> appearing in fa&s;hion as a <HI>man;</HI> that <HI>Son of man</HI> whom the FATHER hath made <HI>&s;trong</HI> for him&s;elf, and who is now &s;et down on the right hand of GOD, our <HI>High prie&s;t</HI> and <HI>King,</HI> both to make <HI>interce&s;&s;ion</HI> and al&s;o to execute <HI>judgment.</HI></P>
<P>We read of the &s;ame <HI>Man</HI> before pre&s;iding over the executioners of the wrath and judgments of God; <HI>Chap.</HI> 9.2. <HI>And behold &s;ix men came from the north, every
<PB N="2" REF="002853_0010_0FE64685A6962898">man with his &s;laughter weapon in his hand, and One man among them was cloathed with linnen.</HI> HE was not one of the <HI>&s;ix,</HI> but they were mini&s;ters and &s;ervants under <HI>Him,</HI> and obeyed his orders. Here are <HI>&s;ix Angels</HI> the mini&s;ters of the GOD MAN Mediator, hearkening to the voice of his word, to do his plea&s;ure while he performs the whole coun&s;el and purpo&s;e of GOD.</P>
<P>In the <HI>ninth Chapter</HI> this glorious <HI>Per&s;on</HI> clothed in linnen is the mini&s;ter of <HI>mercy,</HI> v. 4. employed to go thro' the city and to <HI>&s;et his mark on the men that &s;ighed and cried for the Abominations done therein.</HI> In this <HI>tenth Chapter</HI> he appears as the mini&s;ter of GOD's <HI>vengeance,</HI> as will pre&s;ently be &s;een. And the&s;e <HI>two</HI> are indeed the &s;umm of tho&s;e <HI>Offices</HI> which CHRIST executes as <HI>Mediator</HI> between GOD and man: He effectually <HI>&s;aves</HI> the Elect of GOD from &s;in and wrath, and then he executes <HI>judgment</HI> on all the re&s;t, who will not be &s;aved from &s;in by him.</P>
<P>CHRIST appears here in his <HI>prie&s;tly</HI> Office, <HI>clothed in linnen;</HI> for the Prie&s;ts of old were &s;o clothed; the <HI>white linnen</HI> being &s;ignificant of <HI>purity and holine&s;s;</HI> their <HI>profe&s;&s;ion</HI> thereof, and their <HI>bonds</HI> to it. The &s;potle&s;s holine&s;s and &s;hining righteou&s;ne&s;s of CHRIST is the thing here repre&s;ented. As we read, Revel. 19.8. <HI>The fine linnen is the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;aints.</HI> But here the <HI>linnen</HI> clothing is the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Holy JESUS him&s;elf. He clothes believers in his <HI>own</HI> righteou&s;ne&s;s, and makes them <HI>prie&s;ts to GOD,</HI> and they &s;hall walk with him <HI>in white.</HI></P>
<P>CHRIST is here a <HI>prie&s;t upon his throne,</HI> the judge and the prie&s;t together. This is the <HI>Man,</HI> the <HI>&s;inle&s;s</HI> man, more than a man.</P>
<P N="2">2. This Man is <HI>&s;poken</HI> to: <HI>HE &s;pake unto the Man clothed with linnen and &s;aid.</HI> It is <HI>God the Father,</HI> the &s;upream <HI>Maje&s;ty,</HI> who here &s;peaks to CHRIST, as his <HI>Servant</HI> whom he upholds, his <HI>Elect</HI> in whom his
<PB N="3" REF="002853_0011_0FE677E78296A8A0">heart delighteth. The voice and words came from the <HI>Throne,</HI> &s;ays the fir&s;t ver&s;e. <HI>Then I looked</HI> (&s;ays the Prophet) <HI>and behold in the firmament that was above the head of the Cherubims, there appeared over them as it were a &s;apphire &s;tone, as the appearance of the likene&s;s of a THRONE; and HE &s;pake unto the man clothed in lin|nen,</HI> &amp;c. That is, the <HI>enthroned MAJESTY</HI> in the heavens, HE &s;pake: <HI>GOD THE FATHER Almighty</HI> he &s;pake to his Only begotten <HI>Son,</HI> the <HI>Man CHRIST JESUS.</HI> And now</P>
<P N="3">3. Let us hear the <HI>things &s;aid,</HI> and let him that heareth under&s;tand: <HI>Go in between the wheels, even un|der the cherub, and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims, and &s;catter them over the city.</HI></P>
<P>You mu&s;t know that the day of the de&s;truction of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> was now at hand, even the <HI>burning</HI> of the City and Temple by the army of the king of <HI>Baby|lon. Zedekiah</HI> was now king of the remnant of <HI>Judah,</HI> his reign was &s;hort and his ruine at hand; and the de&s;truction of the city <HI>by fire</HI> is the thing here repre|&s;ented and foretold. <HI>Burnt</HI> it was by <HI>Nebuzaradan</HI> captain of the guard, but <HI>who</HI> did it? why CHRIST the king and judge of the church and of the world. The <HI>Man</HI> the ordained <HI>judge,</HI> he goes in between the <HI>wheels;</HI> for he turns them all, high and dreadful as they are; <HI>He fill'd his hands with coals of fire from be|tween the cherubims,</HI> for they had profaned his altars and his temple; and then he <HI>&s;cattered the coals</HI> over the defiled city and &s;anctuary, which was once <HI>Holi|ne&s;s to the LORD.</HI></P>
<P>It was CHRIST's own hand did it: The flaming brands in the hand of the <HI>Chaldeans</HI> were the coals in <HI>his</HI> hand: <HI>They</HI> did but perform <HI>His</HI> holy word and will and dreadful plea&s;ure. They were the <HI>&s;taff of his indignation.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="002853_0012_0FE677D6941F6DA0">
Finally ob&s;erve, how readily and fully CHRIST executes the will of the FATHER in them whom he <HI>&s;aves,</HI> and in them that <HI>peri&s;h.</HI> Has the FATHER &s;aid to Him, "<HI>Go &s;et a mark</HI> on &s;uch and &s;uch to &s;ave them? He does it: Ezek. 9.11. <HI>And the man clothed with linnen reported the matter, &s;aying, I have done as thou ha&s;t commanded me.</HI> Or doth the FATHER &s;ay to CHRIST, "Go &s;et the city in flames?

<P>Now the thing to be remarked is, That the <HI>burning coals,</HI> the di&s;pen&s;ation of <HI>Judgments,</HI> are put into <HI>the hand of the Man clothed with linnen, and &s;cattered</HI> by Him: Which teaches us this <HI>Doctrine</HI>&mdash; "That the pre&s;ent Judgments of Providence are put into the hand of CHRIST, and come forth from his hand.</P>
<P>But when I &s;ay the <HI>Judgments</HI> of Providence, it can't be meant in exclu&s;ion of the di&s;pen&s;ations of <HI>Mercy</HI> and Grace; which as they do equally belong to the kingdom of <HI>Providence,</HI> &s;o the admini&s;tration of them is equally in the hand of CHRIST. Nor when we &s;ay that the di&s;pen&s;ation <HI>both</HI> of mercy and of judgment is from the hand of the LORD JESUS, can this be under&s;tood in exclu&s;ion of, or derogation from the FATHER and the HOLY GHOST, as if the kingdom of <HI>Providence</HI> were not always in their glorious hand: For the glorious <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> in the GODHEAD are one in e&s;&s;ence and in operation. And altho' there is a &s;pecial <HI>Mediatorial Kingdom</HI> com|mitted to the SON, which takes in the whole Admi|ni&s;tration of the kingdom till the con&s;ummation of all things, when the whole <HI>my&s;tery</HI> of GOD &s;hall be fini&s;hed; yet the <HI>FATHER worketh hitherto</HI> in and by the SON, and &s;o doth the HOLY GHOST with and from Him; and this in a way of <HI>Sovereign</HI> dominion.

<P>The SPIRIT of GOD is therefore repre&s;ented as guiding all the motions of <HI>Providence,</HI> together with the SON OF MAN, in the vi&s;ions which <HI>Ezekiel</HI> had of the <HI>living creatures</HI> and of the <HI>wheels,</HI> Chap. 1.12, 19, 20. <HI>The living creatures</HI> (i. e. the Cherubims or Angels, mini&s;ters in the executing of the Divine will) <HI>went &s;traight forward whither the SPIRIT directed them; and the wheels</HI> (the cour&s;e of nature) <HI>followed them: Whither&s;oever the SPIRIT went, they went; for the SPIRIT of life</HI> (&s;o the Hebrew is) <HI>was in the wheels.</HI> So that we do not exclude the agency, power and &s;overeign influence of the HOLY SPIRIT, in the judgments or mercies of Providence, when we &s;ay that the&s;e are put, into the hand of CHRIST; For the <HI>Man clothed with linnen</HI> is in the <HI>mid&s;t</HI> of the &s;ame Wheels together with the <HI>SPIRIT of life;</HI> And while the <HI>SPIRIT lifts up the wheels,</HI> and the <HI>Cherubims</HI> act under his immedi|ate direction; <HI>lo above the firmament</HI> appears the <HI>Throne,</HI> and the likene&s;s of a <HI>Man</HI> upon it, with a <HI>rain-bow</HI> over his head, and <HI>fire</HI> from his loins down-ward.

I.

Be wi&s;e now therefore O ye kings, be in&s;tructed ye judges of the earth: &s;erve the LORD with fear and rejoice with trembling: Ki&s;s the SON, le&s;t he be angry and ye peri&s;h from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little: Ble&s;&s;ed are all they that put their tru&s;t in him.</HI> The &s;um of this <HI>P&s;alm</HI> is CHRIST's dominion over the kingdoms of men and his <HI>judgments</HI> on them. <HI>In vain</HI> do the <HI>rulers</HI> or <HI>people</HI> of them <HI>take coun&s;el together, and rage again&s;t the LORD, and again&s;t his ANOIN|TED: He &s;hall &s;peak to them in his wrath and vex them in his &s;ore di&s;plea&s;ure.</HI></P>
<P>The like to <HI>this</HI> is the 110. <HI>P&s;alm: The LORD &s;aid to my LORD, &s;et thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy foot&s;tool: The LORD &s;hall &s;end the rod of thy &s;trength out of Zion; rule thou in the mid&s;t of thy ene|mies: &mdash; Thou art a prie&s;t</HI> and king <HI>for ever,</HI> at my <HI>right hand,</HI> and &s;halt <HI>&s;trike thro' kings in the day of</HI> thy <HI>wrath;</HI> &s;halt <HI>judge among the heathen,</HI> and <HI>wound the heads over many countries.</HI> Here the judgments of Providence are put into CHRIST's hand, in words as plain and full as can well be utter'd.</P>
<P>At his fir&s;t manife&s;tation to <HI>I&s;rael, John</HI> the <HI>bapti&s;t</HI> told them that <HI>his Fan was in his hand:</HI> Matth. 3.12.

Agreeably he &s;aid again, <HI>All power is given to me in
<PB N="7" REF="002853_0015_0FE677EED94F8DA0">heaven and on earth.</HI> This power mu&s;t take in that of all the pre&s;ent <HI>judgments</HI> of Providence. As he told the <HI>Jews,</HI> John. 5.22, 27. That <HI>the FATHER had committed all judgment to the SON, and given him authority to execute judgment,</HI> now and hereafter, <HI>becau&s;e he was the Son of man.</HI> The &s;ame thing is in effect &s;aid over and over to the <HI>Chri&s;tian Churches</HI> in the &s;econd and third <HI>Chapters</HI> of the <HI>Revelations</HI> of St. <HI>John.</HI> All the&s;e are plain <HI>Affirmations</HI> that the judgments of Providence are in the hand of CHRIST, and come forth from his hand.</P>
<P N="2">II. We have <HI>vi&s;ionary Repre&s;entations</HI> of this in the Book of God.

He is clad with <HI>zeal as with a cloke,</HI> while he is arrayed in <HI>the garments of &s;alvation.</HI> The fire about the <HI>loins</HI> of the Son of man is alike &s;ignificant of his executing judgment, as the <HI>coals in his hand.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> &s;aw him in the form of <HI>a Stone cut out of the mountain without hands,</HI> which &s;mote the <HI>Image</HI> of Idolatry and <HI>brake</HI> it in pieces, and <HI>it &s;elf became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.</HI> Dan. 2.44.</P>
<P><HI>Zechariah</HI> &s;aw a <HI>Man</HI> riding upon a <HI>red</HI> hor&s;e, and he &s;tood among the <HI>myrtle trees</HI> which were in the

<P>But the&s;e <HI>vi&s;ionary</HI> repre&s;entations of the <HI>Son of man</HI> with the judgments of Providence in his hand are more abundant in the Book of the <HI>Revelations.</HI> So <HI>John</HI> &s;aw him in the mid&s;t of the <HI>golden Candle&s;ticks,</HI> his feet as if they <HI>burned in a furnace,</HI> and his voice as the &s;ound of many waters, and out of his mouth a &s;harp &s;word.</P>
<P>In the 19. <HI>Chap.</HI> of that book, <HI>John</HI> &s;aw a <HI>Man</HI> upon a white hor&s;e, and in righteou&s;ne&s;s he doth <HI>judge</HI> and make war: His eyes were <HI>as a flame of fire,</HI> and on his head were <HI>many</HI> Crowns, and he was clothed in a ve&s;ture dipt in <HI>blood,</HI> and his Name is called the WORD OF GOD: And the <HI>armies</HI> in heaven follow him, clothed in <HI>fine linnen</HI> white and clean, &mdash; Lo the <HI>livery</HI> of CHRIST, which the heavenly ho&s;ts wear, the executioners of his judg|ments upon men, &s;uch as becomes his righteous and <HI>&s;potle&s;s</HI> admini&s;tration. As <HI>He</HI> him&s;elf is clothed with <HI>linnen,</HI> &s;o his <HI>armies</HI> follow him in fine and <HI>white</HI> linnen.

<P N="3">III. I come now to give you &s;ome <HI>Scripture In&s;tan|ces,</HI> or <HI>Facts related,</HI> in which CHRIST has appeared unto men with the Judgments of Providence in his hand.

<P>The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> is the Judgment of GOD on wicked <HI>Sodom:</HI> With re&s;pect to which we read of <HI>three men</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="002853_0017_0FE677EEFA796410">(i. e. two Angels attending CHRIST their Lord and ours) who appeared to <HI>Abraham</HI> in the plains of <HI>Mamre,</HI> as he &s;at in his tent-door, in the heat of the day. Gen. 18.1. <HI>Abraham</HI> as &s;oon as he &s;aw them ran to meet them, bowing him&s;elf to the earth; and perceiving that <HI>One</HI> of the three appeared much the Superior of the other two, he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in a particular manner, and with a more e&s;pecial reve|rence to Him, and &s;aid, <HI>My Lord, If now I have found grace in thy &s;ight, pa&s;s not I pray thee from thy &s;ervant.</HI> It was this <HI>Chief</HI> of the heavenly Gue&s;ts that &s;aid to <HI>Abraham,</HI> v. 10. <HI>I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life, and Sarah &s;hall have a Son:</HI> At the hearing of which when <HI>Sarah</HI> laughed, it is &s;aid v. 13. <HI>And the LORD &s;aid to Abraham, Why did Sarah laugh?</HI> So that this Per&s;on was the LORD him&s;elf, in fa&s;hion as a <HI>Man;</HI> and the other <HI>two</HI> were <HI>Angels,</HI> his &s;ervants and mini&s;ters, who waited on him in this his de&s;cent to our earth.</P>
<P>But there was a more &s;pecial rea&s;on of <HI>His</HI> com|ing down, and <HI>theirs</HI> with Him, than this vi&s;it to <HI>Acraham;</HI> as it pre&s;ently appeared. For as <HI>Abraham</HI> bro't them on their way after their courteous vi&s;it was over, the LORD &s;ent the <HI>two Angels</HI> on their way to <HI>Sodom,</HI> to deliver righteous <HI>Lot</HI> and to <HI>burn</HI> up the cities of that polluted plain; But he &s;topt &s;hort Him&s;elf, and told <HI>Abraham</HI> how great <HI>the cry of the &s;in of Sodom</HI> was before him. Then <HI>Abraham &s;tood before the LORD, and drew near to him,</HI> and made, that mo&s;t awful and reverend <HI>Interce&s;&s;ion</HI> for mercy on the wicked place, which will be famous in the Church for ever; And the LORD granted him his petition till he could not pre&s;ume to ask further. And then the LORD went his way, and <HI>Abraham</HI> returned to his place.</P>
<P>The mean while the heavenly <HI>Me&s;&s;engers</HI> reached <HI>Sodom,</HI> and found as we all know, and the next morn|ing
<PB N="10" REF="002853_0018_0FE677DE5F5D4C00">the <HI>LORD rained brim&s;tone and fire from the LORD out of heaven.</HI> Gen. 19.24. The <HI>Lord the SON</HI> rained the fire from the <HI>Lord the FATHER,</HI> who worketh by the <HI>Son.</HI> It was not the <HI>two Angels</HI> that rained the fire; No, It was the LORD who &s;tood with <HI>Abraham</HI> when <HI>the&s;e</HI> went on their way. It was the <HI>Lord CHRIST,</HI> and He did it from the <HI>FATHER,</HI> who hath committed all judgment to him.</P>
<P>Here now was my <HI>Text</HI> exemplified in the very <HI>letter</HI> of it. Tho&s;e burning <HI>coals</HI> of fire which were <HI>&s;cattered</HI> over the cities of the valley in <HI>Abraham</HI>'s time, came from the hand of the SON OF GOD, the <HI>Man</HI> CHRIST JESUS. That fiery judgment and de&s;olation, the image of the devouring eternal fire and everla&s;ting burnings, came from tho&s;e gra|cious arms which had ju&s;t before embrac'd <HI>Abraham,</HI> and all his &s;piritual <HI>Seed</HI> in him. &mdash; Go, &s;aid the FATHER to Him, <HI>go in between the wheels,</HI> the high and dreadful wheels of my all-governing Providence, and <HI>fill thy hand</HI> with fire and brim&s;tone, and <HI>&s;catter</HI> it down in a rain of furious <HI>flames</HI> upon the accur&s;ed cities, and <HI>burn</HI> them up together: And it was done.</P>
<P>The &s;ame hand that burnt <HI>Sodom,</HI> the <HI>Alient</HI> from his Covenant, did afterward burn <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> the <HI>holy</HI> City.</P>
<P>This in&s;tance alone is a &s;ufficient <HI>Illu&s;tration</HI> of my <HI>text,</HI> and a <HI>Demon&s;tration</HI> of the Truth before us, <HI>That the Judgments of Providence are in CHRIST's hand, and come from Him.</HI></P>
<P>But I come to a <HI>&s;econd</HI> In&s;tance, which is the Judgment of GOD upon the wicked <HI>Cananites,</HI> the Nations which GOD rooted out by fire and &s;word before the Children of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> I might have nam'd the <HI>plagues</HI> that de&s;troyed <HI>Egypt;</HI> for it was CHRIST who appeared to <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in the bu&s;h on fire and &s;ent him to <HI>Pharaoh.</HI> But the latter in&s;tance of his ap|pearance to <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> before <HI>Jericho</HI> may &s;uffice, be|cau&s;e

For to be &s;ure the &s;ame hand that de&s;troyed the <HI>Cananites</HI> executed al&s;o the other judgments.</P>
<P>Now the &s;tory of CHRIST's appearing to <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> with the judgments of Providence in is hand, you have in the 5.

<P>Here was a <HI>Man</HI> in form, but <HI>more</HI> than a man, the mighty SON OF GOD him&s;elf, who afterward took our <HI>fle&s;h,</HI> and took the name of <HI>Jo&s;hua, JESUS,</HI> a <HI>Sa|viour,</HI> the Captain of our &s;alvation. He is the <HI>Cap|tain</HI> of all the <HI>Lord's ho&s;ts,</HI> in heaven above and on earth below; the King of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI>'s Lord. He appeared here with a <HI>drawn &s;word</HI> in his hand, for the <HI>defence</HI> of his Church and for the <HI>&s;laughter</HI> of their enemies.</P>
<P><HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> fell on his face and <HI>wor&s;hipp'd</HI> him, as <HI>Abra|ham</HI> had done in his day with fear and trembling. And becau&s;e he permitted this, we know certainly that he was no meer <HI>Angel</HI> of God; for then he would have forbid it. But this <HI>Man</HI> in appearance received the profound wor&s;hip of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and requir'd it from <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> who fell pro&s;trate before him with aw|ful reverence, faith, love, attention and ready obedi|ence; and &s;aid unto Him, <HI>What &s;aith my LORD unto his &s;ervant?</HI> It became him to fall, and &s;ay thus, be|fore

<P>It was the &s;ame <HI>GOD of I&s;rael</HI> who now appeared to <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> in the form of a <HI>Man,</HI> and had appeared to <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in the form of <HI>devouring fire.</HI> We know him to be the &s;ame GOD, becau&s;e the &s;ame word of com|mand is given to <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> that was before given to <HI>Mo|&s;es, Put off thy &s;hoe from thy foot, for the place whereon thou &s;tande&s;t is holy.</HI></P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s as &s;oon as <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> heard the&s;e words, he knew that it was the &s;ame LORD GOD whom his ma&s;ter <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> had &s;een at <HI>Horeb;</HI> even the <HI>GOD of Abra|ham, of I&s;aac and of Jacob.</HI> See Exod. 3.4, 5.</P>
<P>But <HI>why</HI> did He now appear to <HI>Jo&s;hua?</HI> It was to execute <HI>judgment,</HI> the wrath of God upon the nations of <HI>Canaan,</HI> who&s;e iniquity was now <HI>full.</HI> He threw down the wall of <HI>Jerico,</HI> and commanded it to be <HI>burnt with fire.</HI> A <HI>&s;word</HI> or a <HI>coal</HI> in his hand is the &s;ame thing.

<P>The LORD looked on him and &s;aid, <HI>HAVE NOT ISENT THEE?</HI> If it had not been for <HI>tho&s;e</HI> words, we might have taken the heavenly Appearance for a common Angel; but from <HI>them</HI> we perceive plain|ly that it was the LORD CHRIST him&s;elf, the <HI>An|gel of the Covenant,</HI> the SON OF GOD, in the like|ne&s;s of <HI>man.</HI></P>
<P>And <HI>what</HI> came he for? but to <HI>judge</HI> the enemies of his people, and to &s;end <HI>Gideon</HI> to de&s;troy them. He commi&s;&s;ioned him in his <HI>own</HI> name; <HI>Have not I &s;ent thee?</HI> and in&s;pir'd him with a look.</P>
<P>The Angel is called JEHOVAH, v. 14. <HI>Jehovah</HI> looked on him. I AM &s;ent him: The &s;ame <HI>Angel of the LORD</HI> who called to <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> out of the burning <HI>bu&s;h.</HI> He put a <HI>lamp of fire</HI> into <HI>Gideon</HI>'s hand and gave him the <HI>Word, The &s;word of the LORD and of Gideon.</HI>&mdash; So in all the <HI>Judgments</HI> on the enemies of the Church, in ancient or later times, there has been the hand of CHRIST.</P>

But I come to the <HI>New Te&s;tament,</HI> and mean only to <HI>point</HI> unto a few in&s;tances, and not enlarge on them.&mdash; When our LORD appeared in the fle&s;h, he &s;hew'd that he had the power of <HI>Judgment</HI> com|mitted to him. The <HI>devils</HI> own'd his power, and be&s;o't him not to <HI>torment</HI> them before their time. The <HI>Gadarenes</HI> &s;aw and felt his power to judge them, when he permitted the <HI>devils</HI> to enter into <HI>the herd of &s;wine,</HI> and the whole herd ran violently down a &s;teep place and peri&s;hed in the waters. Matth. 8.32. It was an <HI>awful</HI> thing to behold, and and a &s;evere <HI>judgment</HI> they thought upon their country. The <HI>di&s;ciples</HI> were &s;o &s;en&s;i|ble that the power of judgment re&s;ted on CHRIST, that when &s;ome look'd with di&s;re&s;pect on him and would not receive him, they ask'd him, <HI>Lord wilt thou that we command fire from heaven to de&s;troy them?</HI> Luke 9.54. But the <HI>Son of man</HI> came not <HI>to de&s;troy men's lives, but to &s;ave them.</HI> It was not the time for <HI>Judgment</HI> when he was here on earth. He us'd this power &s;paringly in the days of his fle&s;h. He <HI>fill'd</HI> his hands with <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>&s;catter'd</HI> it about on all the mi|&s;erable that came in his way.&mdash; He had the pow|er of <HI>life</HI> and <HI>death</HI> while he liv'd here, and when he went to die. He &s;truck none <HI>dead,</HI> but he rais'd &s;ome to <HI>life.</HI> He told <HI>Peter</HI> by what kind of death he &s;hould glorify GOD; but when <HI>Peter</HI> ask'd, what &s;hould be|come of <HI>John?</HI> the LORD an&s;wer'd him in a <HI>&s;ove|reign</HI> manner, <HI>If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?</HI></P>
<P>When JESUS was a&s;cended and glorified he &s;hew'd his Church that he exerci&s;ed the power of judgment over men. The death of <HI>Ananias</HI> and <HI>Sap|phira</HI> was a fearful in&s;tance of it: And &s;o was the blow on <HI>Elima<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> the Sorcerer. Act 13.11.</P>
<P>To name no more, The &s;econd burning of <HI>Jeru&s;a|lem</HI> was from the hand of CHRIST. When the <HI>Romans</HI> compa&s;&s;ed the City, it was <HI>the &s;ign of the Son of man

<P>Let this &s;uffice for the <HI>third</HI> Illu&s;tration and proof of the <HI>Doctrine,</HI> That the judgments of Providence are in CHRIST's hand. The&s;e are &s;o many <HI>facts</HI> and in&s;tances from &s;acred <HI>&s;tory.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. The &s;acred <HI>Doctrines</HI> of Chri&s;tianity do infer and confirm this truth. I will name <HI>two</HI> only, and but name them.</P>
<P N="1">1. The GODHEAD of CHRIST infers this, That the judgments of Providence are in his hand. For can he be GOD and this glory not belong to him? According to tho&s;e words of GOD concerning Him|&s;elf; <HI>Is there any evil in the city and the LORD hath not done it? See now that I, even I am He, and there is no GOD with me! I kill and I make alive, I wound and I heal.</HI></P>
<P>I might argue from the nature, end, extent and duration of the <HI>Mediatorial Kingdom,</HI> that CHRIST is GOD over all, and that all <HI>judgment</HI> is in his hand. The <HI>end</HI> of it is to <HI>recover the elect</HI> of GOD out of that &s;tate of <HI>&s;in</HI> and <HI>mi&s;ery</HI> into which they fell by <HI>A|dam</HI>'s tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, into a &s;tate of holine&s;s and hap|pine&s;s for evermore; and to <HI>execute judgment</HI> (the ven|geance of a holy and righteous GOD) upon all &s;uch as will not accept of his offered grace, and &s;ubmit to the terms of his mercy. Now in order to <HI>this</HI> the kingdom, power and rule put into the <HI>Mediator</HI>'s hand mu&s;t be <HI>univer&s;al</HI> and <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> as to this world of ours: <HI>all</HI> things mu&s;t be put into his hand and <HI>under his feet,</HI> and he mu&s;t <HI>reign</HI> till all his enemies are made his <HI>foot&s;tool.</HI>&mdash; So that whether we con&s;ider CHRIST in his GODHEAD, or in his <HI>Mediatorial</HI> dignity and
<PB N="16" REF="002853_0024_0FE6781850552700">offices, the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of Providence and the <HI>Judgment</HI> of Providence mu&s;t be in his hand.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>general Judgment</HI> of the world at the la&s;t day being committed to CHRIST, nece&s;&s;arily &s;up|po&s;es that the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> judgments of Providence are &s;o. That CHRIST is the <HI>Judge</HI> of quick and dead at the great Day, is one of the cleare&s;t Doctrines of the <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Mat. XXv. 31, 32. Acts XVII. 31. 2 Cor. v. 10. 2 The&s;&s; I. 7, 8.</NOTE>: <HI>Then the Son of man &s;hall come in his glory with all his holy Angels, and before him &s;hall be gathered all nations: The Lord JESUS &s;hall be revealed from heaven in flaming fire taking vengeance.</HI> The <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> judgments of Providence are but previous and preparatory for this <HI>final</HI> Judgment. <HI>That</HI> is but the period and con&s;um|mation of the&s;e; the la&s;t and mo&s;t eminent act of his <HI>Regality,</HI> and di&s;play of his judicial power; at the clo&s;e whereof he will &s;urrender the Kingdom to the FATHER. 1 Cor. 15.28.</P>
<P>Indeed the&s;e great and &s;acred <HI>Doctrines</HI> of Chri&s;ti|anity, like Truth which is uniform, do infer and prove one another. If CHRIST be GOD he mu&s;t have the power of <HI>Judgment,</HI> pre&s;ent and future. If he have <HI>this power</HI> truly he is the SON OF GOD, and all men mu&s;t honour Him even as they honour the FATHER. Again, If the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> judgments of Pro|vidence are in his hand, no doubt but he is the <HI>or|dained Judge</HI> in the la&s;t day: And if the <HI>General</HI> judg|ment be committed to Him, no wonder that the <HI>pre|&s;ent</HI> executing of judgment is &s;o.</P>
<P>But this for the <HI>Proof</HI> of the Doctrine: I come to the <HI>Application</HI> and U&s;e of it.</P>
<P>And <HI>fir&s;t</HI> in a more <HI>general</HI> manner I &s;hall <HI>hint</HI> at many things, which in the choice of the Subject I de&s;igned to have enlarged on; and then <HI>&s;econdly</HI> I
<PB N="17" REF="002853_0025_0FE677F593099C88">&s;hall <HI>enlarge</HI> on a more <HI>particular</HI> Application, which could not be fore&s;een and de&s;igned, but <HI>Providence</HI> has ca&s;t it in our way, and loudly calls to it in the late awful and threatning <HI>Earthquake.</HI></P>
<P>We have &s;een the united Glories of <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> and <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> in the Per&s;on and Offices of our <HI>LORD Re|deemer.</HI> We &s;ee that He is GOD and JUDGE, who is our <HI>Saviour.</HI> We &s;ee the <HI>evil</HI> (the great evil) of <HI>&s;in</HI> and <HI>&s;inners,</HI> from the terrible Judgments and puni&s;h|ments that come from the hand of CHRIST him&s;elf. We &s;ee that tho' He be <HI>gracious and merciful and abun|dant in goodne&s;s,</HI> yet he will <HI>by no means clear the guilty</HI> and impenitent. We &s;ee the <HI>rea&s;on</HI> of the great <HI>pati|ence,</HI> forbearance and long&s;uffering of GOD to pro|voking &s;inners; It is CHRIST the <HI>Saviour</HI> who thus waiteth to be gracious to them, <HI>not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h, but that all &s;hould come to repentance.</HI> We &s;ee the <HI>&s;afety</HI> of believers in the power of Judgment committed to CHRIST; his <HI>Saints</HI> are in one hand while the <HI>burning coals</HI> are in the other: As he took a mo&s;t gracious care of <HI>Lot</HI> in the day of <HI>Sodom,</HI> and as he <HI>marked out</HI> the humble and penitent for Salvati|on in my <HI>context,</HI> before he took a <HI>coal</HI> in his hand for the de&s;truction of the wicked.</P>
<P>If the Judgments of Providence are in CHRIST's hand and come from his hand, <HI>He</HI> then is the object of our <HI>fear,</HI> our <HI>tru&s;t,</HI> our <HI>prayer</HI> and <HI>prai&s;e.</HI> He is to be <HI>feared</HI> for his power, holine&s;s, ju&s;tice and goodne&s;s. <HI>Wilt thou not be afraid of the Power?</HI> He is the <HI>Mini|&s;ter</HI> of GOD to execute vengeance. It is a <HI>fearful</HI> thing to fall into his living hands. The <HI>forgivne&s;s</HI> which is with him commands our <HI>fear,</HI> for it comes to us in the way of glorious <HI>holine&s;s</HI> and ju&s;tice. P&s;al. 2. ult. <HI>Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trem|bling; ki&s;s the SON le&s;t he be angry and ye peri&s;h from the way;&mdash; Ble&s;&s;ed are all they that put their tru&s;t in him.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="002853_0026_0FE6781871E2D408">
Again, We may be &s;ure there is as much <HI>Mercy</HI> in all the judgments of Providence, as is con&s;i&s;tent with <HI>rectoral Wi&s;dom</HI> and righteous <HI>Government.</HI> So it was in the judgment of the <HI>old World,</HI> of <HI>Sodom,</HI> of the <HI>Ca|naanites,</HI> and afterward of <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> And &s;o it is in the executions of wrath upon particular <HI>per&s;ons,</HI> while in the afflictions of the <HI>Godly</HI> there is abundance of mercy and love.</P>
<P>No wonder that <HI>afflictions</HI> are made <HI>&s;aving</HI> to men, means of grace and holine&s;s to them; &s;ince the Judg|ments of Providence are in the hand of CHRIST. Why el&s;e &s;hould they be put into the hand of a <HI>holy Saviour,</HI> but to be made ble&s;&s;ed and effectual means of <HI>&s;anctification</HI> and <HI>&s;alvation</HI> to &s;ouls?</P>
<P>And no wonder then that we are &s;o &s;trictly requir'd to be <HI>patient, &s;ilent, re&s;ign'd</HI> in all our afflictions; yea <HI>thankful and joyful</HI> in our tribulations. For can a Be|liever acting like him&s;elf do otherwi&s;e, when he con|&s;iders every di&s;pen&s;ation of Providence coming from the &s;ame merciful hands of CHRIST, which were once &s;tretched on the <HI>cro&s;s</HI> and peirced for his &s;alva|tion? He that judges and corrects us is the <HI>LORD</HI> that has loved us and died for us; and &s;hall we not with <HI>Aaron</HI> hold our peace? and with <HI>Job</HI> &s;till ble&s;s his name?</P>
<P>And if <HI>death</HI> comes to thee or thine, do we not know that the <HI>key</HI> of it is in CHRIST's hand? He will order for the be&s;t all that concerns the living and the dying of his cho&s;en and called ones; And what &s;hould calm and moderate a Chri&s;tian's grief like this, "It is CHRIST has done it?</P>
<P>But while it <HI>comforts</HI> us it mu&s;t al&s;o <HI>humble</HI> us, to con&s;ider that our many and great <HI>afflictions</HI> come from the hands of CHRIST. How <HI>awful</HI> is it to a belie|ver on JESUS to think,&mdash; Are the judgments of Providence in <HI>His</HI> hand, and I <HI>&s;o</HI> judged by him? O how my LORD convinceth me of &s;in! how evil am
<PB N="19" REF="002853_0027_0FE677F8460F6440">I in his holy eyes! What have I done to offend and provoke a gracious <HI>Saviour?</HI> how vile and odious are <HI>my</HI> &s;ins to him, and &s;hould be to me! what a corrupt nature have I that needs all this correction! that I mu&s;t be <HI>&s;aved &s;o as by fire!</HI> O what would have be|come of me long ago, if the judgments of GOD had been in any other hand but that of my <HI>Lord RE|DEEMER!</HI> Therefore it is <HI>that I am not con&s;umed!</HI></P>
<P>Once more O <HI>afflicted</HI> child of GOD, think <HI>who&s;e</HI> hand it is that corrects thee: Is it CHRIST's? then it is more and better than any <HI>friend</HI>'s, or <HI>brother</HI>'s, or <HI>father</HI>'s hand: And wilt thou not be in a quiet <HI>&s;ubje|ction?</HI> &s;hall we <HI>murmur again&s;t CHRIST? as they of old murmured, and were de&s;troyed by him?</HI> Alas! <HI>they</HI> knew not <HI>the hand</HI> that proved them, as <HI>we</HI> do: <HI>They</HI> &s;aw him in <HI>types</HI> and &s;hadows, but <HI>we</HI> &s;ee him in a <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> light. The <HI>end</HI> of afflictions mu&s;t be very gracious to <HI>Believers,</HI> and the <HI>fruit</HI> of them happy. CHRIST, who&s;e care and charge <HI>they</HI> are, will &s;ee to <HI>this.</HI> It is the very work of a <HI>Saviour</HI> to &s;ee to it: <HI>Faithful is he that hath called you, who al&s;o will do it.</HI></P>
<P>The maje&s;ty and judgment of CHRIST is only <HI>terrible</HI> to unbelieving and <HI>impenitent &s;inners;</HI> and to them it may well be the more terrible to &s;ee <HI>the wrath</HI> in the face of the <HI>LAMB.</HI> For if <HI>He</HI> judge them, who &s;hall pity or &s;ave them? GOD has put this <HI>honour and maje&s;ty</HI> on him that his <HI>right hand may find out all his enemies, all that hate him:</HI> He will <HI>make them as a fiery oven in the time of his anger;</HI> He will <HI>&s;wallow them up in his wrath, and the fire &s;hall devour them: Be theu ex|alted LORD in thy own &s;trength, &s;o will we &s;ing and prai&s;e thy power.</HI></P>
<P>Finally, In all our approaches to CHRIST in his holy <HI>In&s;titutions</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This part of the <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> was preached before the <HI>Sacra|ment</HI> of the LORD's SUPPER.</NOTE>, it &s;hould &s;trike us with exceeding

<P>Particularly in the Ordinance of the SUPPER. our <HI>Lord JESUS</HI> exhibits him&s;elf to us with the <HI>judgments</HI> of Providence in his hand. Read the awful words of this import, 1.

For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh JUDGMENT to him&s;elf, not di&s;cerning the LORD's body. For this cau&s;e many are WEAK and SICKLY among you, and &s;ome SLEEP. For if we would JUDGE our &s;elves we &s;hould not be JUDGED. But when we are JUDGED we are cha&s;tened of the LORD that we &s;hould not be condemned with the world.</HI></P>
<P>You &s;ee that the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> is &s;peaking here of <HI>temporal</HI> judgments, which the LORD inflicted on the <HI>Corin|thians</HI> for their &s;trange irreverence and carnality in their participation of the <HI>holy Supper.</HI> They eat and drank <HI>not di&s;cerning</HI> the LORD's body; therefore they eat and drank <HI>judgment</HI> to them&s;elves. &mdash; But what was the <HI>judgment?</HI> why for this cau&s;e many were <HI>&s;ick</HI> and <HI>weak</HI> among them. &mdash; And yet as to &s;ome of them the&s;e judgments were <HI>not in wrath,</HI> but in <HI>mercy;</HI> For when they were <HI>judged</HI> they were but <HI>cha&s;tned</HI> of the LORD (to humble and reform them) that they &s;hould not be condemned with the would. &mdash; Wherefore here was CHRIST, even

Both the threatning and the pre&s;ervation came to us from the holy, mighty, terrible and merciful hand of our <HI>Lord and Saviour JESUS CHRIST. He</HI> &s;hook the earth under us in that awful manner, and to that fearful degree, which we lately felt; and <HI>He</HI> kept it from rending and clea|ving a&s;under under us, &s;o that we and all that apper|tains to us were not &s;wallowed up quick. It &s;hould be very <HI>affecting</HI> to us to realize &s;uch a <HI>Providence</HI> and di&s;pen&s;ation as coming from the hand of CHRIST him&s;elf.</P>

<P>I told you that it was CHRIST came down to <HI>Sodom,</HI> and rained the <HI>fire (&s;catter'd the coals)</HI> on <HI>Go|morrah,</HI> and <HI>Admah,</HI> and <HI>Zeboim,</HI> from the LORD out of heaven. He then al&s;o <HI>rent</HI> that ground to pieces on which tho&s;e polluted <HI>Cities</HI> had &s;tood, and from the <HI>deep</HI> which lieth under he bro't up a <HI>flood of water,</HI> and quench'd the flames that had burnt up the wick|ed, and turn'd that once <HI>rich and plea&s;ant vale</HI> into a &s;tanding <HI>filthy lake,</HI> or <HI>dead &s;ea.</HI> The SON OF GOD came down in the form of a <HI>Man,</HI> (<HI>Abraham</HI> &s;aw Him) and executed that <HI>judgment:</HI> The accur&s;ed places <HI>&s;unk</HI> under his feet, and a flood ro&s;e and cover'd them from mortal eyes for ever.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o &s;aid before how the &s;ame <HI>Lord CHRIST</HI> came down in the day of <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> the fatal day of ac|cur&s;ed <HI>Jerico,</HI> and produced another <HI>Earthquake,</HI> or what was like it and equal to it. <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> &s;aw a <HI>Man</HI> with his &s;word drawn, but he &s;ound him to be a GOD, with the <HI>fires</HI> and winds of vengeance in his hand, prepared again&s;t the enemies of his Church and people. The <HI>fire</HI> he put into <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI>'s hand and order'd the devoted City to be <HI>burnt</HI> as &s;oon as he &s;hould take it; but the &s;ubterraneous <HI>wind</HI> he kept in
<PB N="24" REF="002853_0032_0FE6782119D07988">the hollow of his <HI>own</HI> hand, and on the <HI>&s;eventh</HI> day, at the <HI>&s;eventh</HI> compa&s;&s;ing the city, the <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> blew with their rams-horns, and <HI>the hand of CHRIST</HI> (pro|bably an <HI>Earthquake</HI> at his &s;pecial command) <HI>threw down</HI> the walls of <HI>Jerico</HI> in an in&s;tant; all but the hou&s;e of <HI>Rahab,</HI> who <HI>by faith</HI> had received his &s;er|vants and protected them.</P>
<P>Thus CHRIST was in the Earthquake at <HI>Sodom,</HI> and at the falling of the wall of <HI>Jerico;</HI> and every <HI>other</HI> &s;hake of the earth, whether before or after tho&s;e times, have come from the <HI>&s;ame</HI> hand.</P>
<P>For in&s;tance, The <HI>earthquake</HI> at the time of <HI>Noah</HI>'s flood (if we may &s;o &s;peak) when <HI>the foundations of the great Deep were broken up,</HI> was the Judgment of CHRIST upon the world of the ungodly. It was as much &s;o as the <HI>Conflagration,</HI> or the peri&s;hing of the world <HI>by fire</HI> at the la&s;t day, will be from the <HI>coals</HI> in CHRIST's hand. The &s;ame <HI>Judge,</HI> and the &s;ame <HI>Power</HI> and ven|geance which once came by <HI>water,</HI> will hereafter <HI>be revealed in flaming fire.</HI></P>
<P>The earthquake at <HI>Sinai</HI> was from the pre&s;ence of CHRIST and his immediate hand, who came down then in the glory of the FATHER, as he will do another day, with his holy <HI>Angels,</HI> in devouring <HI>fire,</HI> and <HI>the mount quaked greatly.</HI> Exod. 20.18. The <HI>Chari|ots of GOD were twenty thou&s;and</HI> (even <HI>chariots of fire</HI>) thou&s;ands of <HI>Angels,</HI> and the LORD was among them. The mountain <HI>melted</HI> before Him, even that <HI>Sinai.</HI> Judg. 5.5. The Apo&s;tle to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> tells us that it was CHRIST's <HI>voice which then &s;hook the earth,</HI> who has promis'd &s;aying, <HI>Yet once more I &s;hake not the earth only, but heaven al&s;o.</HI> Heb. 12.26.</P>
<P>CHRIST was the <HI>LORD GOD of Elijah,</HI> and in the &s;pirit of <HI>that Prophet</HI> his Fore-runner came. He came to his <HI>&s;ervant</HI> once in a <HI>whirlwind,</HI> and in an <HI>earthquake,</HI> and in devouring <HI>fire.</HI> You have the repre|&s;entation of this fearful thing, I Kings 19.11, 12.
<PB N="25" REF="002853_0033_0FE677FED92CAFD8"><HI>And behold the LORD pa&s;&s;ed by, and a great and &s;trong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: And after the wind an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake: And after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the fire: And after the fire a &s;till &s;mall voice: And it was &s;o, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out.</HI> How terrible was this appearance of CHRIST unto his <HI>Prophet?</HI> Who without a divine &s;upport could <HI>abide the indignation,</HI> and the tokens of &s;o tremendous a <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> and of the <HI>fiercene&s;s of his anger? His fury was poured out like fire, and the rocks were thrown down by him.</HI> (To apply here the maje&s;tic words of the Prophet <HI>Nahum.</HI>) &mdash;But how is it &s;aid, <HI>That the LORD was not</HI> in the rending wind or earthquake? <HI>Who</HI> was in it, but the <HI>LORD</HI> him&s;elf? &mdash; It means not that the &s;pecial and immediate hand of CHRIST was <HI>not</HI> therein: No, it only means <HI>"That he did not manife&s;t his pre&s;ence by any di&s;tinct voice</HI> (the &s;mall and &s;till voice of a <HI>Man</HI>) in that wind and fire and earthquake, as he afterward did in the <HI>calm</HI> that &s;ucceeded. So <HI>Eli|jah</HI> beheld the glory of CHRIST, in all the <HI>terrors</HI> of an infinitely holy, powerful, offended Maje&s;ty; and yet in the <HI>&s;oft</HI> voice of grace.</P>
<P>And thus we have &s;een CHRIST in one <HI>Earth|quake</HI> and another in the days of old. And no won|der then is it that we read of the earth's <HI>quaking</HI> by his power at his <HI>death</HI> and <HI>re&s;urrection.</HI> Mat. 27.51. <HI>The earth did quake and the rocks rent.</HI> Well might they at the horrid deed, and marvailous event, <HI>the Cruci|fixion of the SON OF GOD.</HI> v. 54. <HI>The Centurion and they that were with him, watching JESUS,</HI> (the <HI>guard</HI> at the execution) <HI>&s;aw the earthquake, and feared greatly, &s;aying, Truly this was the SON OF GOD.</HI> Like trem|bling &s;eiz'd the guard at his <HI>Sepulchre,</HI> Mat. 28.2. <HI>And
<PB N="26" REF="002853_0034_0FE67821404B5528">behold there was a great Earthquake, and the keepers did &s;hake and became as dead men.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;uch maje&s;ty and great terror did CHRIST die and ri&s;e again. The wonder was that the revi|ling <HI>Soldiers</HI> and hardy <HI>keepers</HI> (or rather their <HI>ma&s;ters</HI> and rulers) were not &s;wallow'd up alive. But <HI>the Son of man came not to de&s;troy mens lives, but to &s;ave them.</HI></P>
<P>When he pleas'd afterward to manife&s;t Him&s;elf to his <HI>Di&s;ciples,</HI> by &s;haking the places where they were <HI>wor&s;hipping</HI> him or <HI>&s;uffering</HI> for him, it was in token of his <HI>favour</HI> and grace to them. So he came upon them in the day of <HI>Penteco&s;t</HI> in <HI>a ru&s;hing mighty wind;</HI> and again, when they had <HI>prayed,</HI> (Act. 4.31.) the place was <HI>&s;haken</HI> where they were a&s;&s;embled together, and they were again <HI>filled with the HOLY GHOST, and &s;pake the word of GOD with boldne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>So at the prayers and prai&s;es of <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI> in the <HI>pri&s;on,</HI> &s;uddenly there was an <HI>Earthquake,</HI> and the <HI>foundations</HI> of the pri&s;on were &s;haken. Act. 16.30. Happy Earthquake to the <HI>Jailor</HI> and his hou&s;e! the ordained means of his effectual conviction and con|ver&s;ion. The impre&s;&s;ion of that ble&s;&s;ed fright never wore off; we charitably think. <HI>He and all his were &s;traightway bapti&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>To add no more on this head: In the Book of the <HI>Revelations</HI> we find the great <HI>Events</HI> of Providence and the mighty <HI>changes</HI> re&s;pecting the Church of CHRIST and the whole World; which are yet ma|ny of them in the hand of the MOST HIGH, and in his times to be &s;hewn <HI>who is the ble&s;&s;ed and only Potentate, King of kings and LORD of lords;</HI> The&s;e changes and events (I &s;ay) are repre&s;ented by <HI>earth|quakes</HI> as well as by <HI>thundrings and lightnings</HI> &amp;c. CHRIST governs in all the&s;e concu&s;&s;ions and revo|lutions, the&s;e <HI>literal</HI> or <HI>figurative</HI> earthquakes; with an immediate hand, order and direction.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="002853_0035_0FE67800CBC26BF8">
As in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> chapter of that <HI>Book,</HI> it is HE THE SON OF MAN that appears in his maje&s;ty and great <HI>terror,</HI> in the mid&s;t of his Churches, <HI>the &s;even golden Candle&s;ticks;</HI> to &s;how his <HI>&s;ervant</HI> the things that &s;hall be hereafter.

<P>At the opening of the <HI>&s;ixth &s;eal,</HI> Rev 6.12. <HI>John &s;aw a great Earthquake; and the &s;un became black as Sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood, and the &s;tars fell to the earth, and the heaven departed as a &s;erowl, and every mountain and i&s;land moved out of their place.</HI> This was but a <HI>vi&s;ion;</HI> yet was it a vi&s;ion of the <HI>true</HI> power of CHRIST, in the kingdom of <HI>nature,</HI> and over the <HI>nations</HI> of men: And it gives us a fair image of his immediate <HI>agency</HI> and rule in all the revolutions in the <HI>natural</HI> or <HI>moral</HI> world.

<P>In the 8th. <HI>Chap.</HI> 5. v. we have a place exactly <HI>parallel</HI> to my <HI>text:</HI> It may be worth our while to <HI>compare</HI> them, and &s;ee if the <HI>coals of fire</HI> from the altar, and the <HI>earthquake</HI> be not in the &s;ame hand. &mdash; In my <HI>text</HI> the GOD-MAN, <HI>Mediator,</HI> goes in between the <HI>wheels,</HI> and fills his hand with <HI>fire</HI> from between the <HI>cherubims,</HI> and <HI>&s;catters</HI> it over the City. &mdash; In the 8th.

But while He is continually doing this for his &s;aints, &s;o his vi&s;ible Church on earth grows <HI>earthly, worldly,</HI> formal and corrupt; And then (v. 5.)

<P>I might turn you to <HI>&s;everal</HI> more places in the <HI>Re|velations of St. John</HI> to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, but I will point unto <HI>one</HI> only. We read (<HI>Chap.</HI> 16.17.) of the <HI>&s;eventh Angel</HI> his pouring out his <HI>vial</HI> into the air, and there was a <HI>GREAT EARTHQUAKE,</HI> &s;uch as was not &s;ince men were upon the earth, &s;o <HI>MIGHTY AN EARTHQUAKE</HI> and &s;o great: For the <HI>great City</HI> (the Empire of <HI>Antichri&s;t</HI>) fell into <HI>three</HI> parts, and the <HI>cities of the nations</HI> (which have given their power to the <HI>bea&s;t</HI>) fell; and <HI>GREAT BABYLON</HI> came in|to remembrance before GOD; and every i&s;land fled away and the mountains were not found.&mdash; A <HI>ble&s;|&s;ed</HI> earthquake truly! <HI>Lord JESUS</HI> ha&s;ten it on! hor|rible and tremendous to bloody <HI>Rome</HI> and the <HI>papal</HI> powers! more e&s;pecially to <HI>Italy</HI> that &s;eat of <HI>&s;odomy</HI> and earthquakes! that land of <HI>&s;ulphur</HI> and &s;ubterrane|ous <HI>fires!</HI>&mdash; And why may not its <HI>fall</HI> be by <HI>literal</HI> earthquakes and eruptions of <HI>&s;ulphureous</HI> flames? The fiery hand of CHRIST &s;hall effect this. See the 18. <HI>Chap.</HI> of the <HI>Revelations.</HI></P>
<P>Thus I have at large &s;hown that <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> both proper and figurative, are in the hand of our <HI>Lord JESUS CHRIST,</HI> and come forth from his hand.</P>
<P>When therefore in the days of his fle&s;h he &s;pake of <HI>this Sign,</HI> that &s;hould fore&s;hew <HI>the Day of his coming;</HI> whether to judge <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> or <HI>Babylon,</HI> or the <HI>World</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="002853_0037_0FE67800F10B9290">at the la&s;t day; He then &s;ufficiently informed us that <HI>this judgment</HI> was in his hand among others. Mat. 24.7. <HI>There &s;hall be earthquakes in divers places,&mdash; the beginning of &s;orrows.</HI> Luke 21.11. <HI>Earthquakes and great &s;igns from heaven.</HI> He will accompli&s;h <HI>in his times</HI> the things of which he has thus given warn|ing.</P>
<P>And now to return unto the <HI>Inference</HI> I am upon: From all that we have heard we mu&s;t needs be con|vinced and &s;atisfied, That <HI>the late ama&s;ing Earthquake which vi&s;ited us the la&s;t Lord's-day in the night was &s;ent to warn us from CHRIST, our king, our lawgiver, our judge and our &s;aviour.</HI></P>
<P>It was <HI>He him&s;elf</HI> who threatned to der&s;toy us, as in a moment. The <HI>earthquake</HI> was from <HI>his</HI> hand, whatever might be the <HI>natural Cau&s;es</HI> of it; all <HI>which</HI> are al&s;o in the hand of CHRIST, and he works by <HI>them</HI> as he plea&s;es with infinite <HI>fore&s;ight</HI> of men and things, and with an unerring direction. We <HI>need</HI> not, we <HI>&s;hould</HI> not look any further, (in a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> and practical con&s;ideration of the thing, and a religious improvement of it) than the will and government of CHRIST. This becomes us as <HI>Sinners</HI> that would be awakned, and as <HI>Believers</HI> that de&s;ire to be humbled and edified; and it behoves us to act the part of <HI>&s;uch</HI> rather than of <HI>Philo&s;ophers.</HI> They &s;earch darkly and uncertainly (however curiou&s;ly and laudably) into the bowels of the earth and the &s;ecrets of nature; but we have the plain <HI>Go&s;pel of CHRIST</HI> to look into, and <HI>&s;ee as in a gla&s;s the glory of the LORD.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the <HI>threatning</HI> of a &s;udden and a fearful de|&s;truction coming on us in the terrible earthquake was from CHRIST.</P>
<P N="2">II. Our PRESERVATION from the threatned de&s;truction was from the &s;ame glorious HAND. The hand that <HI>&s;hook</HI> the rod over us could have <HI>&s;tricken</HI> with it; he that threatned could ea&s;ily have executed.
<PB N="30" REF="002853_0038_0FE67823DC8BE838">He that &s;et the earth a trembling, held it together under us; the &s;ame hand is mighty to &s;ave and to de&s;troy. <HI>The LORD is our judge, and he &s;aves it.</HI></P>
<P>There are not <HI>two Principles</HI> or powers, as &s;ome of the fooli&s;h <HI>Heathen</HI> conceived; the one the author of the <HI>evil,</HI> the other of the <HI>good</HI> that comes to the children of men: No, the living and only true GOD is the author of <HI>both; A ju&s;t GOD and a Saviour.</HI> I&s;ai. 45.7. <HI>I form the light and create darkne&s;s, I make peace and create evil; I the LORD do all the&s;e things</HI> &mdash; And the <HI>mea&s;ure</HI> of every judgment is from him; the mo|deration of it and period to it.

<P>CHRIST &s;its upon the floods, and rides upon the winds, and reigns King for ever; Ab&s;olute, Sove|reign, irre&s;i&s;tible and unaccountable. His blood is the cement that binds the fabrick of heaven and earth together. The earth and its inhabitants were <HI>di&s;&s;ol|ving,</HI> but he came and holds up the <HI>pillars</HI> of it.</P>
<P>The ground had &s;wallow'd up <HI>Adam</HI> in the day of his fall, if it had not been for this <HI>SEED of the Woman,</HI> this <HI>IMMANUEL, GOD with us.</HI> Our fallen <HI>parents</HI> heard immediately why they did not <HI>in&s;tantly die,</HI> and return to their ground; Namely, becau&s;e there &s;hould <HI>a Child be born, a Son be given</HI> them, who &s;hould be <HI>the Mighty GOD, the Prince of peace,</HI> on whom the <HI>Government</HI> &s;hould be laid.

<P>As &s;oon as the <HI>Angels</HI> &s;inned the heavens <HI>rent</HI> under them, and they <HI>fell</HI> (O mighty fall!) from the height
<PB N="31" REF="002853_0039_0FE67806DD280510">of heaven down into the deep Aby&s;s of hell, into the bottomle&s;s pit. The rea&s;on was, <HI>CHRIST took not the nature of Angels,</HI> took not <HI>hold</HI> of them as they fell. He took the &s;eed of <HI>Adam,</HI> and therefore the earth rent not under him; the pit did not &s;wallow him up as it did <HI>the angels that &s;inned,</HI> for whom there is no redemption.</P>
<P>CHRIST has been the Saviour of all <HI>tho&s;e</HI> that have e&s;caped in one de&s;troying <HI>earthquake</HI> and another &s;ince the world began.</P>
<P>In the <HI>flood,</HI> when the <HI>foundations of the great deep</HI> were <HI>broken up,</HI> CHRIST &s;aved <HI>Noah</HI> and his family: <HI>He</HI> gave him <HI>faith,</HI> provided him an <HI>Ark,</HI> &s;hut him up in it, &s;et it gently afloat, held and &s;teer'd it in that boy&s;terous &s;ea (that fury of the waters) without a rudder or a &s;ail, and &s;oftly re&s;ted it (without an an|chor to ca&s;t out) on the mountains of <HI>Ararat.</HI> Well therefore did <HI>Noah</HI> bring his <HI>&s;acrifices</HI> to his Deliverer, when he came forth from the <HI>Ark,</HI> &s;o many <HI>types</HI> of that <HI>Death</HI> from whence come all our <HI>&s;alvations.</HI>&mdash; Who &s;et the <HI>bow</HI> in the sky, and gave it to <HI>Noah</HI> as the token of his <HI>Covenant?</HI> but HE who afterward ap|peared in vi&s;ion to <HI>Ezekiel</HI> as a <HI>Man upon the throne, with the bow as in the day of rain.</HI></P>
<P>To go on, When <HI>Lot</HI> was &s;aved from the fire and earthquake, it was CHRIST him&s;elf came down, and &s;ent his <HI>angels</HI> to his hou&s;e: If he had found but <HI>ten</HI> &s;uch righteous ones, he would have &s;pared the place for their &s;akes.&mdash; Again, When the wall of <HI>Jerico</HI> fell, <HI>faith</HI> &s;aved <HI>Rahab</HI> and her hou&s;e.

<P>The &s;ame <HI>Lord JESUS</HI> &s;aved <HI>us</HI> and our families, our lives and our limbs, our dwellings and &s;ub&s;tance, in the day when he lately &s;hewed us his power, his anger and our de&s;erts. As he reach'd out his arm to

<P>To conclude, The inference is &s;trong and obvi|ous, That if the <HI>judgments</HI> of Providence are in the hand of CHRIST, &s;o are the <HI>mercies</HI> thereof equally from his all-governing hand; many and great and various as they are.

<P>We have our per&s;onal and family mercies, which are exceeding <HI>precious;</HI> and there are the common and publick mercies to the Church and people of GOD together, which are <HI>greater</HI> than tho&s;e; The <HI>publick</HI> &s;hares in the goodne&s;s of Providence to every private per&s;on, and <HI>every one</HI> &s;hares in the general goodne&s;s of Providence to the publick; the <HI>glory</HI> of all belongs to CHRIST, and to Him we mu&s;t <HI>&s;ing</HI> both of the mercy and the judgment.</P>
<P>The &s;ame hand that fed <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in the wilderne&s;s and puni&s;hed them there, feeds and judges the <HI>Church</HI> &s;till. Believers mu&s;t know and con&s;ider that it is the death of CHRIST has purchas'd for them the com|mon favours and bounties of Providence; in which they &s;hould ta&s;te his covenant love, <HI>ta&s;te and &s;ee that

<P>By every <HI>&s;hake</HI> of the earth GOD &s;ays to his <HI>Pro|te&s;tant</HI> people, <HI>Partake not of her &s;ins that ye receive not of her plagues.</HI> So he &s;aid of <HI>old Babylon,</HI> Jerem. 51.6. <HI>Flee out of the mid&s;t of her, and deliver every man his &s;oul: Be not cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of the LORD's vengeance.</HI> So the <HI>Angels</HI> &s;aid to <HI>Lot</HI> in the la&s;t night of <HI>Sodom,</HI> Gen. 19.12. <HI>Ha&s;t thou here any be&s;ides? &s;on or daughter? bring them out of this place; for the LORD hath &s;ent us to de&s;troy it.</HI></P>

<P N="3">III. The <HI>Earthquake</HI> that vi&s;ited us, and wherein we have been mercifully <HI>pre&s;erved</HI> by CHRIST not only meant to awaken <HI>greater Sinners</HI> to repentance, but <HI>all</HI> and every one, even the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> of &s;inners. The &s;hake was <HI>common</HI> to all; the greater and the le&s;s, elder and younger, godly and ungodly; and <HI>awful</HI> to all, awakning to all. It bro't every ones <HI>&s;in</HI> to re|membrance, and &s;et every one a <HI>trembling.</HI> Every ones <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> an&s;wer'd to the terrible Voice of GOD at that in&s;tant, as &s;peaking to him. The <HI>child</HI>'s heart &s;mote him as well as the <HI>Parents,</HI> and his <HI>that feared GOD</HI> as well as his <HI>who feared</HI> him not.</P>
<P>He that is without <HI>&s;in</HI> let him be without <HI>fear,</HI> and &s;tand excepted from the call to <HI>repent.</HI> It came not to call the <HI>righteous</HI> but <HI>&s;inners</HI> to repentance; even as CHRIST him&s;elf came. Who can &s;ay, <HI>I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my &s;in?</HI> And if not, Who then can &s;ay, The warning was not to <HI>me?</HI> Every <HI>&s;in</HI> (and much more every <HI>&s;inner,</HI> the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> of whom is guilty of <HI>many</HI> &s;ins) "de&s;erves the wrath and cur&s;e of GOD both in this life and that which is to come.</P>
<P>Indeed the <HI>greate&s;t</HI> &s;inners are in the greate&s;t <HI>dan|ger,</HI>
<PB N="45" REF="002853_0053_0FE67861C5307208">and &s;hould be in the greate&s;t <HI>fear:</HI> But it is not always &s;o. Very often the <HI>lea&s;t &s;inners</HI> fear <HI>mo&s;t</HI> under the judgments of GOD, and always the <HI>mo&s;t Godly</HI> fear <HI>be&s;t,</HI> if not mo&s;t, under his awful threatnings; while <HI>greater</HI> &s;inners are too often fearle&s;s and hard|ned. So <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was afraid of the fierce anger of the LORD, le&s;t it &s;hould break forth upon the fearle&s;s &s;inners; and <HI>Jo&s;iah</HI>'s heart was <HI>tender</HI> and he <HI>rent</HI> his robes, when it may be his <HI>Courtiers</HI> were not a whit moved.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t</HI> then let me &s;ay, The <HI>Earthquake</HI> came to awa|ken <HI>greater &s;inners</HI> to a <HI>great</HI> repentance for their <HI>many</HI> and <HI>mighty</HI> &s;ins. It came to &s;et <HI>the&s;e</HI> in order before them, and it call'd upon <HI>them</HI> to <HI>rend their hearts.</HI> Did not <HI>their</HI> hearts &s;mite them? was not their <HI>Countenance changed,</HI> and how did their <HI>tho'ts trouble</HI> them? Well might their <HI>joynts be loo&s;ed,</HI> and their <HI>knees &s;mite one a|gain&s;t another? Fearfulne&s;s and trembling came upon</HI> them, and <HI>horror overwhelmed</HI> them. A <HI>vi&s;ion pa&s;s'd before</HI> them <HI>which made all</HI> their <HI>bones to &s;hake, and the hair of</HI> their <HI>head &s;tood up.</HI> Every hardy &s;inner <HI>&s;prang up trem|bling;</HI> the <HI>athei&s;t</HI> believ'd and trembled, the <HI>prayerle&s;s</HI> called upon GOD, the <HI>profane</HI> tongue faulter'd, and the lips of the <HI>bla&s;phemer</HI> quiver'd: The <HI>worldling</HI> felt his earth &s;inking, the <HI>drunkard</HI> &s;aw it reeling like him&s;elf, and rottenne&s;s enter'd into the <HI>lewd</HI> man's bones: the <HI>liar,</HI> the <HI>thief</HI> and the <HI>fal&s;e &s;wearer</HI> &s;aw the <HI>flying-roll</HI> enter'd into their <HI>hou&s;e, to con&s;ume it with the timber and &s;tones thereof:</HI> The <HI>Sabbath-breaker</HI> tho't his &s;oul <HI>that night required</HI> for the profanation of the <HI>Day</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Earthquake</HI> was in the night after the <HI>Lord's day.</HI></NOTE> pa&s;t; and every <HI>formal,</HI> carele&s;s, irreverent and hy|pocritical wor&s;hipper had that peal of <HI>woes</HI> rung in his cars, Matth. 23.</P>
<P>Thus CHRIST came in the <HI>earthquake,</HI> as he will hereafter in the <HI>judgment day,</HI> to <HI>convince all that are
<PB N="46" REF="002853_0054_0FE67834F20A68D8">ungodly of their ungodly deeds and hard &s;peeches;</HI> yet to &s;often and take away the <HI>heart of &s;tone,</HI> and to break the <HI>rock</HI> in pieces. The wicked are harder than the earth and &s;tones if they are not moved and &s;haken and broken under &s;uch a providence; harder than the cruel hearts of the inraged mob and magi&s;trates at <HI>Phi|lippi,</HI> who when they had &s;orely beaten <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Si|las,</HI> and thru&s;t them into the dungeon, yet when the <HI>earthquake</HI> came at night they were &s;o terrified and convinced of their unrighteous act, that as &s;oon as it was day they &s;ent and relea&s;ed them; yea came them&s;elves and be&s;o't them and brought them out of pri&s;on. And well might "<HI>their Con&s;ciences make furi|ous reflections</HI> on them for what they had done, when they came to con&s;ider that they had u&s;ed the <HI>Men of GOD</HI> &s;o barbarou&s;ly only for ca&s;ting the <HI>devil</HI> out of a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed <HI>dam&s;el;</HI> and when GOD had <HI>&s;hook</HI> the City, made the ground to tremble, at their horrid deed.</P>
<P>But <HI>&s;econdly, Le&s;&s;er</HI> &s;inners &s;hould be awakned and much affected at a terrifying <HI>earthquake,</HI> as well as greater &s;inners. And indeed <HI>the&s;e</HI> are more likely to hear and fear, and receive in&s;truction. The impre|&s;&s;ion enters the ea&s;ier and deeper on a <HI>tender</HI> heart. In what a fright were our <HI>Children</HI> and young people, many of them, when they heard and felt the <HI>Earth|quake?</HI> how did they <HI>run</HI> to the pre&s;ence and arms of their helple&s;s <HI>Parents,</HI> and attend to their <HI>prayers</HI> in that hour of con&s;ternation? what <HI>gracious words</HI> did many of them &s;peak to their pious Parents at that time? And how were <HI>all that fear GOD</HI> affected with his hand, humbled under it and the more penitent before him? The <HI>men of GOD</HI> did, like <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> fear <HI>exceedingly;</HI> were afraid of his <HI>fierce</HI> anger. Like <HI>Abra|ham</HI> they were moved for the &s;ouls and bodies of o|thers, for the godly and for the wicked, for <HI>Lots hou&s;e</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="002853_0055_0FE67861E7B000F0">and for every <HI>&s;odomite.</HI> Like <HI>Ezra</HI> they rent their hearts for their own and their people's &s;ins. Like <HI>Jo&s;iah</HI> their heart was tender, and they cried out&mdash; <HI>Great is the wrath of the LORD again&s;t us.</HI> Like <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> they ran into the <HI>gap,</HI> and &s;tood in the <HI>breach,</HI> to turn away GOD's anger. And like <HI>David</HI> &s;ome might <HI>open</HI> their own con&s;cious hearts to the &s;word of ju&s;tice, and &s;ay, <HI>Upon me LORD let thy hand be,</HI> but &s;pare the &s;heep of thy pa&s;ture.</P>
<P>Every gracious heart is tender and <HI>contrite</HI> before GOD, and <HI>trembles</HI> at his voice, whether in his writ|ten Word or &s;peaking Providence: And to every &s;uch per&s;on the <HI>high and lofty One</HI> will look. I&s;ai. 66.2. Gracious <HI>Elihu</HI> could not &s;ee the <HI>lightning</HI> of GOD nor hear his <HI>thunder</HI> (things much more common than an <HI>Earthquake,</HI> yet awful like it) but <HI>his heart trembled and was moved out of its place:</HI> Job 37.1. <HI>Hear atten|tively</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>the noi&s;e of his voice, and the &s;ound that goeth out of his mouth! He directeth it under the whole heaven,&mdash; after it a voice roareth:&mdash; Hearken to it, O. Iob: &s;tand &s;till, and con&s;ider the wondrous works of GOD.</HI> The be&s;t of men need to be awakned, and to awake them&s;elves to a very humble diligent attenti|on to the mind of GOD in his wondrous works. And none will hearken to him with like reverence and godly fear as the mo&s;t godly. Like the Prophet <HI>Hab|bakkuk</HI> who <HI>heard GOD's &s;peech and was afraid,</HI> and pray'd, <HI>O LORD in wrath remember mercy.</HI> Hab. 3.16. <HI>When I heard my belly trembled, my lips quivered, rottenne&s;s enter'd into my bones.</HI> Well might this be, had the <HI>Prophet</HI> been holier than he was; for he &s;aw <HI>the ever|la&s;ting mountains &s;cattered and the perpetual hills bowing</HI> before the Maje&s;ty of GOD.</P>
<P>So then under &s;uch a di&s;pen&s;ation as this, of a dreadful <HI>Earthquake,</HI> every &s;inner, the <HI>greater</HI> and the <HI>le&s;s</HI> are loudly called to humiliation and repentance. Surely the <HI>greater</HI> will think the &s;hake &s;ent to <HI>them,</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="002853_0056_0FE6783C133D52D0">and &s;urely not to them only, but to <HI>me</HI> al&s;o, will the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> of &s;inners be ready to &s;ay; Yea <HI>to me the chief of &s;inners</HI> will he &s;ay that is mo&s;t <HI>eminent in grace</HI> and in repentance. &mdash; But to go on,</P>
<P N="4">IV. The <HI>earthquake</HI> came and CHRIST <HI>pre&s;erv'd us in it</HI> to awaken us to an in&s;tant flight to <HI>Him</HI> as the <HI>Refuge</HI> of our &s;ouls, the rock and <HI>tower of &s;alvation</HI> to us. <HI>The name of the LORD is a &s;trong tower, the righte|ous runneth into it and is &s;afe.</HI> Prov. 18.10.

We mu&s;t put our &s;elves by faith into tho&s;e <HI>&s;aving hands</HI> which are filled with the <HI>burning coals.</HI> No other hand can &s;ave us.

How would he gather us, <HI>as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings</HI> in a time of dan|ger! How gladly then &s;hould we <HI>gather</HI> to him, to the <HI>covert</HI> of his wings. P&s;al. 57.1. <HI>Be merciful unto me O GOD, be merciful unto me, for my &s;oul tru&s;teth in thee; Yea in the &s;hadow of thy wings will I make my re|fuge until the&s;e calamities be overpa&s;t.</HI> There is no &s;afe|ty for us <HI>now,</HI> at <HI>death,</HI> nor in the day of <HI>judgment,</HI> without an intere&s;t in CHRIST by faith.

<P>Thus the <HI>Earthquake,</HI> and our pre&s;ervation in it by the hand of CHRIST, &s;hould ha&s;ten our <HI>flight</HI> to <HI>Him</HI> as the <HI>refuge</HI> of our &s;ouls; with faith, fear, love, prayer, prai&s;e, and &s;elf con&s;ecration. We &s;hould
<PB N="52" REF="002853_0060_0FE6783D9B741F38">be very &s;olemn, fervent, deliberate and yet &s;peedy in this per&s;onal tran&s;action with the great GOD.</P>
<P N="5">V. FAMILY-RELIGION is a very &s;pecial duty which the earthquake and our pre&s;ervation in it ad|moni&s;hes us of and calls us to. The threatning was to <HI>families</HI> and the pre&s;ervation was of them. Our <HI>hou&s;es</HI> were &s;haken, and yet &s;pared. They might have cru&s;h'd and buried us. CHRIST's voice to us is &s;erve me in your hou&s;es; and our an&s;wer &s;hould be that, Jo&s;h. 24.15. <HI>As for me and my hou&s;e we will &s;erve the LORD.</HI> Our hou&s;holds and our &s;ub&s;tance &s;hould be bro't under a renewed con&s;ecration to CHRIST, and have HOLINESS TO THE LORD written on them. The walls and <HI>&s;tones</HI> of our hou&s;es in a manner <HI>cried</HI> to us as they &s;eem'd falling, and they may <HI>cry out</HI> again&s;t us if the fear and wor&s;hip of GOD be not always in them for time to come.</P>
<P>CHRIST calls us to repent of and reform our <HI>family &s;ins,</HI> and that <HI>we put iniquity far from our taberna|cles.</HI> Job. 22.23. And he warns us to make more con&s;cience of family and <HI>relative duties.</HI> For in&s;tance, FAMILY INSTRUCTION; according to the command of GOD Deut. 6.6, 7, 8. <HI>And the&s;e words which I command thee this day &s;hall be in thy heart, and thou &s;halt teach them diligently unto thy children; and &s;halt talk of them when thou &s;itte&s;t in thy hou&s;e, and when thou lie&s;t down and when thou ri&s;e&s;t up.</HI> FAMILY-WOR|SHIP is another duty which the pre&s;ervation of our dwellings and hou&s;holds demands of us: family <HI>prayer</HI> and <HI>prai&s;e</HI> morning and evening, together with the reading GOD's word. Shall there be any <HI>prayerle&s;s families</HI> among us, or prayerle&s;s <HI>per&s;ons</HI> and <HI>clo&s;ets</HI> in any family, after &s;uch a &s;hake of our hou&s;es? GOD forbid. Read the righteous and terrible Imprecation or cur&s;e that hangs over &s;uch irreligious hou&s;es, Jer. 10.25. <HI>Pour out thy fury upon the heathen, and upon
<PB N="53" REF="002853_0061_0FE6786A009F12A8">the families that call not upon thy name.</HI> Say not it means the families of fal&s;e wor&s;hip and <HI>Idolatry</HI> in the heathen nations; for grant it &mdash; yet thy hou&s;e <HI>(O Chri&s;tian)</HI> is wor&s;e in GOD's &s;ight than any <HI>hea|thens</HI> if CHRIST be not daily wor&s;hipt in it. Carry thy hou&s;e daily to <HI>him</HI> to be <HI>&s;prinkled</HI> with his blood, <HI>the blood of the pa&s;&s;over,</HI> that the <HI>Angel of death</HI> may not &s;mite it. Let our &s;pared dwellings be <HI>Bethels,</HI> for GOD to be <HI>wor&s;hipt</HI> in, for him to <HI>dwell</HI> in. And let the pre&s;ence of CHRIST in them, with the judg|ments and &s;alvations of Providence in his hand, be awfully apprehended by us in daily family wor&s;hip. As <HI>Jacob</HI> wak'd in the morning and &s;aid, <HI>How dread|ful is the place! it is the hou&s;e of GOD and gate of heaven.</HI> And that CHRIST may come under our <HI>roof,</HI> and bring <HI>&s;alvation</HI> with him as he did to the hou&s;e of <HI>Zaccheus,</HI> let FAMILY-GOVERNMENT be pre|&s;erved and maintained among us. When GOD threatned our hou&s;es lately, did he not in effect &s;end us the me&s;&s;age which he did once to <HI>Eli, Tell him that I will judge his hou&s;e, for that when his &s;ons made them&s;elves vile he re&s;trained them not.</HI> And now that GOD has pre&s;erv'd our hou&s;es and hou&s;holds, &s;hould we not re&s;olve and pray and &s;ing with <HI>David,</HI> P&s;alm. 101. <HI>I will &s;ing of mercy and of judgment, unto thee O LORD will I &s;ing: I will behave my &s;elf wi&s;ely in a perfect way; O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my hou&s;e with a perfect heart; I will &s;et no wicked thing before my eyes; I hate the work of them that turn a&s;ide, it &s;hall not cleave to me:&mdash; He that walk|eth in a perfect way he &s;hall &s;erve me; he that worketh deceit &s;hall not dwell within my hou&s;e; he that telleth lies &s;hall not tarry in my &s;ight.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover,</P>
<P>Not only &s;hould Heads of families, but <HI>children</HI> and <HI>&s;ervants</HI> al&s;o, be greatly aw'd and affected with the threatning and &s;alvation of GOD's providence. Be

Attend the <HI>wor&s;hip</HI> of the family with great &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and reverence, and &s;ubmit to the <HI>good order</HI> and rule of the Hou&s;e, for it is the Government of CHRIST. There is a parental as well as a pa&s;toral <HI>watch,</HI> and it is for your <HI>&s;ouls, as tho&s;e that mu&s;t give an account, that they may do it with joy and not with grief.</HI>&mdash; In a word, We read of <HI>the voice of &s;alvation and rejoicing in the taber|nacles of the righteous:</HI> So let it be with <HI>us;</HI> The voice of <HI>&s;alvation</HI> and rejoicing is in our dwellings, let them be the tabernacles of the <HI>righteous.</HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. From <HI>our own</HI> hou&s;es let us pa&s;s to the <HI>Hou&s;e of GOD:</HI> The threatning <HI>Earthquake</HI> and our pre|&s;ervation in it loudly calls us to a more reverend re|gard to his <HI>holy Sabbath</HI> and the <HI>Ordinances</HI> of his Wor&s;hip. The <HI>Lord's-day,</HI> is the religious &s;anctifica|tion of it, is the &s;pecial &s;ea&s;on and means of <HI>holine&s;s</HI> among men, and of <HI>glory</HI> to CHRIST. Therefore is the ob&s;ervation of it &s;o &s;trictly commanded, and the profanation &s;o &s;everely threatned and revenged<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Levit. 19.30. Exod. 31.13 Jorem. 17.27. Levit. 26.31, 34. 2 Chron. 36.20, 21.</NOTE>. <HI>ye &s;hall keep my Sabbaths, I am the LORD: Verily my Sabbaths ye &s;hall keep, for it is a &s;ign between me and you thro' out your generations, that I am the LORD that doth &s;anctify you. But if ye will not hearken to me to hallow the Sabbath day, then I will kindle a fire in the gates of Jeru&s;alem, which &s;hall devour its palaces.</HI> And accor|dingly the <HI>coals</HI> in my text were &s;cattered on <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> for polluting GOD's &s;abbaths: <HI>They burnt the hou&s;e of GOD and brake down the wall of Jeru&s;alem, and carried the remnant to Babylon, to fulfil the word of the LORD, until the land enjoy'd her Sabbaths.</HI> As therefore it was in the night after the <HI>Lord's-day</HI> that the terrible
<PB N="55" REF="002853_0063_0FE6786A241EB828">Earthquake vi&s;ited us, &s;o it calls us to judge our &s;elves for the many <HI>Sabbaths</HI> which we may have trifled away and lo&s;t, profaned and polluted. Take it as a loud warning again&s;t the <HI>loo&s;ene&s;s</HI> of multitudes on the <HI>Evenings</HI> of the <HI>Lord's-day;</HI> as well as for the <HI>neglect</HI> of GOD's public Wor&s;hip by multitudes among us. And let per&s;ons and families judge them&s;elves for their &s;ecret and family omi&s;&s;ions and di&s;orders. Do they not <HI>bring wrath</HI> upon the land <HI>by profaning the Sabbath?</HI> Nehem. 13.18.</P>
<P>Let tho&s;e that live in an ea&s;ie and carele&s;s neglect of the holy <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> of CHRIST, for them&s;elves or their children, remember how the <HI>Angel</HI> of the LORD met <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in the <HI>Inn</HI> and threatned to &s;lay him, for his omitting to <HI>circumci&s;e</HI> his &s;on. Exod. 4.24, 25. <Q><HI>Omi&s;&s;ions</HI> are &s;ins, and mu&s;t come into judgment, and particularly the neglect and contempt of the <HI>&s;eals</HI> of the Covenant; for it is a &s;ign we undervalue the <HI>promi&s;es</HI> of the Covenant, and are di&s;pleas'd with the <HI>conditions</HI> of it.</Q> So Mr. <HI>Henry. Mo&s;es</HI> in&s;tantly humbled him&s;elf, and put the mark of GOD upon his &s;on, and the <HI>angel of death</HI> departed from him.</P>
<P>Some think <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was &s;truck with a <HI>mortal &s;ickne&s;s</HI> in the Inn, and GOD let him know that it was for his neglecting to circumci&s;e his child. And we know the threatning of GOD in the day when he gave the law of Circumci&s;ion to <HI>Abraham,</HI> Gen. 17.14. <HI>The uncircumci&s;ed man-child&mdash; that &s;oul &s;hall be cut off from my people, he hath broken my covenant.</HI> The threat|ning had like to have been executed on the excel|lent <HI>parent</HI> for his omi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Let tho&s;e al&s;o fear the <HI>judgments of CHRIST</HI> who <HI>never</HI> came to his <HI>Table,</HI> or come <HI>unworthily</HI> thereunto. Are the <HI>judgments of Providence in his hand?</HI> and has he &s;aid, <HI>This do in remembrance of me?</HI> and will he not judge men for their <HI>Omi&s;&s;ion</HI> of this duty? Or has he &s;aid again, <HI>Let a man examine him&s;elf and &s;o let him eat
<PB N="56" REF="002853_0064_0FE67845D7D30790">of that bread and drink of that cup; for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh judgment to him|&s;elf?</HI> and &s;hall we not <HI>judge</HI> our &s;elves that we may not be <HI>judged?</HI> We know how the <HI>Corinthians</HI> were judged for their <HI>irreverence,</HI> 1. Cor. 11.30. <HI>Many were &s;ick and weak</HI> among them, and <HI>&s;ome</HI> died. Judge then, (and &s;urely the <HI>coals</HI> in the hand of CHRIST call us to judge our &s;elves) Whether there is not a general faulty <HI>neglect</HI> of the <HI>Table</HI> of <HI>CHRIST</HI> among us? And whether there be not much <HI>unworthy eating and drinking</HI> found with us? &mdash; Should not the loud and terrible threatning of judgment bring <HI>both the&s;e</HI> to a &s;erious con&s;ideration with us? &mdash; Surely CHRIST calls many among us to his long neglected <HI>Table,</HI> that his hou&s;e may be full; and I hope is bringing many to it by the awful alarm which he has given them. And &s;urely he calls all his <HI>Churches</HI> to a more reve|rend ob&s;ervation of <HI>this,</HI> and every <HI>other</HI> of his Infti|tutions. Let us remember how <HI>Nadab</HI> and <HI>Abibu,</HI> as well as <HI>Corah,</HI> died with their <HI>cen&s;ers</HI> in their hands; and what the HOLY ONE &s;aid thereupon, <HI>I will be &s;anctified in them that draw nigh me.</HI> Very awful al|&s;o is his threatning, Levit. 26.14, 15. <HI>If ye will not bearken to me, and will not do all the&s;e Commandments; if ye &s;hall de&s;pi&s;e my &s;tatutes, and if your &s;oul abhor my judg|ments, and you break my covenant; I al&s;o will do this unto you, I will even appoint over you terror.</HI></P>
<P N="7">VII. And la&s;tly, By the terrible <HI>threatning</HI> and the merciful <HI>pre&s;ervation</HI> in the late amazing <HI>Earthquake,</HI> CHRIST warns us <HI>to get ready for his Coming;</HI> for death, judgment and eternity. Is it not a <HI>&s;ign</HI> to us of the <HI>Son of man,</HI> how quickly and &s;uddenly he may come? Is it not a warning to us to get ready for it? Mat. 24.42. <HI>Watch therefore, for ye know not what hour your LORD doth come: Therefore be ye al&s;o ready, for in &s;uch an hour as you think not the &s;on of man cometh:
<PB N="57" REF="002853_0065_0FE678722FDC1728">Ble&s;&s;ed is that &s;ervant whom his LORD when he cometh &s;hall find &s;o doing.</HI> Luke 12 35, 36. <HI>Let your loins be girded about and your lights burning, and be ye as men that wait for their LORD, to open unto him immediately.</HI> Is not this the meaning of his <HI>threatning, "Or I will come upon thee quickly?</HI> and this the language of his <HI>&s;paring mercy, "Ble&s;&s;ed is he that watcheth and keepeth his gar|ments.</HI></P>
<P>Surely CHRIST meant to give us a very &s;en&s;ible conviction of the <HI>vanity and emptine&s;s of this world</HI> and all the enjoyments of it; and to rai&s;e our <HI>affections</HI> to and fix them on <HI>the things that are above, where He is at the right hand of GOD?</HI> O what did <HI>this</HI> world and life and all the things of it &s;eem to us, while the earth was &s;haking and as it were &s;inking under us! So let us always look on it as a peri&s;hing thing, and far from being any portion for an immortal Creature. 1. John. 2.17. <HI>The world pa&s;&s;eth away and the lu&s;ts thereof, but he that doeth the will of GOD abideth for ever.</HI> Col. 3.3. <HI>Set your affections on things above, and not on things upon the earth; for ye are dead and your life is hid with CHRIST in GOD; When CHRIST who is your life &s;hall appear then &s;hall ye al&s;o appear with him in glory</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Mat. 6.19. 1. Cor. 7 29, &mdash; 31.</NOTE></P>
<P>Let us realize it, that there is a more terrible <HI>&s;hake</HI> before us, than that which &s;o lately terrified us; even DEATH! which with a cold but &s;trong hand will &s;hake our &s;ouls out of our bodies. And what will it avail us that we have been delivered from an <HI>Earth|quake</HI> now, if a few days hence the pit below, <HI>the bot|tomle&s;s pit,</HI> open its mouth upon us and &s;wallow us up? What will it avail us that CHRIST grants this <HI>&s;pace for repentance,</HI> if after a hard and <HI>impenitent heart</HI> we only trea&s;ure up <HI>wrath</HI> again&s;t the day of wrath! When it &s;hall be <HI>more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah</HI>

<P>The &s;inners of the <HI>Old world,</HI> on whom the Long, &s;uffering of GOD waited in the days of <HI>Noah,</HI> tho' they peri&s;hed by a <HI>flood</HI> of water for their impeni|tence, will fare <HI>better</HI> in the day of judgment than <HI>Go&s;pel &s;inners.</HI> And the wicked <HI>Sodomites,</HI> who re|jected the warnings of <HI>Lot</HI>'s righteous and grieved &s;oul from day to day, tho' they peri&s;hed by <HI>fire</HI> here, yet will hereafter find a more <HI>tolerable</HI> place in hell than Go&s;pel &s;inners. And the &s;inners of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> that had &s;uch a <HI>Vengeance</HI> taken of them in the fir&s;t and &s;econd de&s;truction of that famous City, yet will be le&s;s mi&s;erable than <HI>we</HI> in the day of judgment, if we peri&s;h in their &s;ins.

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>I&s;aiah XXIv. 6.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Therefore hath the Cur&s;e devoured the Earth.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS <HI>Chapter</HI> is fill'd with <HI>lamentation and mourning and woe.</HI> The <HI>burden of the whole earth</HI> it may be called. For tho' it doubt|le&s;s refers more immediately to the <HI>ravages and de&s;olations</HI> made far and near by the &s;word of the <HI>A&s;&s;irian,</HI> or the <HI>Babylonian</HI> armies; yet it may &s;eem al&s;o de&s;igned to repre&s;ent and bewail the <HI>general Cur&s;e</HI> which <HI>&s;in</HI> has bro't upon the world of mankind.</P>
<P>It begins thus, <HI>Behold the LORD maketh the earth empty, and maketh it wa&s;te, and turneth it up&s;ide down;&mdash; the land &s;hall be utterly emptied and utterly &s;poiled;&mdash; the world langui&s;heth and fadeth away;&mdash; the earth is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; becau&s;e they have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the law, changed the ordinance, broken the everla&s;ting covenant: Therefore hath the Cur&s;e devoured the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>It is GOD's <HI>cur&s;e</HI> that is here &s;poken of; what He has uttered, and which he inflicts. The <HI>&s;ubject</HI> of this cur&s;e is the <HI>Earth</HI> whereon Mankind dwell: <HI>That</HI> &amp;c its inhabitants are under the cur&s;e. The <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of the cur&s;e is <HI>Sin,</HI> and the holy wrath of GOD which
<PB N="64" REF="002853_0070_0FE67847293B5BE0">it provokes. The <HI>cur&s;e</HI> is the threatning of the law, the righteous puni&s;hment of &s;in. The <HI>nature</HI> of the cur&s;e is de&s;cribed here from the terrible <HI>effects</HI> of it, its <HI>de|vouring the Earth.</HI> This makes the <HI>Cur&s;e,</HI> namely, its devouring and de&s;tructive nature.</P>
<P>This is according to the <HI>threatning of GOD</HI> and his Judgment pa&s;s'd on <HI>Adam, Cur&s;ed is the ground for thy &s;ake.</HI> This became the glory and holine&s;s of the infinite GOD, the Maker and Sovereign of the Uni|ver&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Doct. That the Cur&s;e of the great GOD is come upon the Earth for Man's &s;in, and hath devoured it.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. There is the <HI>Cur&s;e</HI> of the great and holy GOD. <HI>Behold the LORD maketh the Earth empty,</HI> &amp;c. He only hath a <HI>right</HI> to cur&s;e, and he alone has <HI>power</HI> to do it. To <HI>Him</HI> it belongs to <HI>cur&s;e</HI> and to <HI>ble&s;s,</HI> and whom he ble&s;&s;eth are ble&s;&s;ed indeed, and his cur&s;e is effe|ctual and takes place. P&s;alm 94.1. <HI>O LORD God to whom vengeance belongeth.</HI></P>
<P>He made the earth <HI>good</HI> and ble&s;&s;ed it: he made <HI>man</HI> holy and happy and ble&s;&s;ed him. The cur&s;e is of <HI>our &s;elves,</HI> we bro't it on the earth. GOD is the &s;ame ble&s;&s;ed, holy, good and wi&s;e Being, when he cur&s;eth as when he ble&s;&s;eth. There is <HI>no &s;hadow of change</HI> in Him.

<P N="2">II. There are <HI>many Plagues</HI> which belong to death and the cur&s;e, by which the earth has been and &s;till is devoured.

<P>I will &s;ingle out and name <HI>&s;ome</HI> of the&s;e <HI>plagues</HI> and cur&s;es, which devour the Earth; whereof <HI>how little a part</HI> is known by us, and how little can the <HI>lea&s;t part</HI> be de&s;cribed by us.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>War</HI> is one part of the Cur&s;e; one cruel and woful thing whereby it has devour'd the earth. From the days of <HI>Nimrod</HI> it has been ravaging and devour|ing; &s;laying its thou&s;ands and ten thou&s;ands, laying wa&s;te Cities and Provinces. One devouring <HI>Bea&s;t</HI> and another have been the true <HI>Images</HI> of war.

And thus the &s;word goes on devouring for ever: The de&s;tructions are perpetual and never like to come to an end. Death and the cur&s;e have even &s;ub&s;i&s;ted upon the wars, which have murder'd the nations of men. The labours and fruits of the field are the lea&s;t part of its devouring; It makes <HI>its arrows drunk with blood,</HI> and <HI>the &s;word devours fle&s;h.</HI> Would you &s;ee the Earth de|vour'd? you have it, Dan. 7.23. <HI>And the fourth bea&s;t &s;hall devour the whole earth, and &s;hall tread it down and break it in pieces.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>pe&s;tilence,</HI> that invi&s;ible &s;word of death, <HI>which walketh in darkne&s;s,</HI> is another <HI>form</HI> of the Cur&s;e which devours the earth.

<P N="3">3. <HI>Famine</HI> and the cau&s;es of it are another part of the cur&s;e which devours the earth.

<P>But the day of <HI>Judgment</HI> is the day of terror; when the <HI>graves</HI> &s;hall open at the voice of CHRIST, and the <HI>&s;eas</HI> too, and throw up their dead, <HI>&s;pue</HI> out the vile bodies of the wicked; which would be glad then if the earth would kindly open again, and cover them for ever from the face and wrath of the <HI>Lamb.</HI> Then the mo&s;t <HI>fearle&s;s</HI> and audacious &s;inners that are or have been on earth, <HI>the Captains and the mighty men,</HI> with all their ungodly train of dependents, <HI>every bond man</HI>

<P>But I &s;aid that I did not call it a <HI>Judgment,</HI> but a <HI>warning</HI> and threatning of judgment, and a <HI>call</HI> to <HI>re|pentance.</HI> It had been a terrible judgment if GOD had &s;uffer'd it to go further, as he ea&s;ily could, and was eno' provoked by our &s;ins.

<P>But O the <HI>mercy!</HI> the wonder of mercy! that after &s;uch a &s;hock we do not hear of one hou&s;e fallen, nor of a &s;ingle life lo&s;t, nor of a broken bone!

<P>And I tru&s;t GOD means this Providence in <HI>mercy</HI> to many, and of great <HI>glory</HI> to Him&s;elf in their con|ver&s;ion and &s;alvation.

It looks as if GOD had ordained to him&s;elf <HI>prai&s;e and &s;trength from the mouths of babes and &s;ucklings</HI> for the pre&s;ent: But O how &s;oon may the fearful minute be forgotten, and this &s;udden impre&s;&s;i|on wear off? It will certainly do &s;o if GOD do not graciou&s;ly fa&s;ten it by the power of his SPIRIT on our hearts; which we mu&s;t earne&s;tly beg of him with in|ce&s;&s;ant &s;upplications, and be often looking back on that <HI>night of trembling,</HI> and call to mind what our apprehen&s;ions, pravers and tho'ts then were; and of|ten put our hou&s;holds on thinking over their &s;ober tho'ts and fervent holy de&s;ires and purpo&s;es (by the grace of GOD) at that time.</P>
<P>Indeed &s;uch <HI>extraordinary</HI> things are not the ordina|ry means of <HI>conver&s;ion</HI> to &s;inners. They may be &s;o, and they ought to be &s;o; but the impre&s;&s;ions of &s;ud|den frights and &s;urprizing terrors are apt as &s;uddenly and &s;trangely to wear off. If men hear not <HI>Mo&s;es and the Prophets,</HI> the preached <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> neither will they be per&s;uaded tho' one &s;hould come to them <HI>from the dead.</HI> The congregation of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> lay quaking before the burning and &s;haking <HI>Mountain,</HI> but how few of them were &s;uitably or &s;avingly affected with what they &s;aw and heard? Yea tho' they had a <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> with them, to teach and warn and entreat them.</P>
<P>Again, One day the &s;inners in <HI>I&s;rael</HI> fled at the cry of &s;inking <HI>Dathan</HI> and <HI>Abiram,</HI> but the very next day they fell a murmuring again, and called <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> the murderers of the LORD's people.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="002853_0091_0FE6788994DF1808">
Yet in the hand of the SPIRIT, and by his ble&s;|&s;ing on the <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Prayer,</HI> this Providence may be|come an effectual means for convincing and convert|ing &s;inners, and for the building up of &s;aints in faith and holine&s;s to eternal life. GOD of his infinite mercy grant it may be &s;o.</P>
<P>He has u&s;ed one more <HI>Means</HI> with us, if we will be wro't upon by things <HI>extraordinary;</HI> and the Year has been filled with many <HI>&s;uch</HI> means, even <HI>thunder and tempe&s;t and the flame of devouring fire.</HI> O that there were &s;uch an heart in us! this was GOD's own wi&s;h re&s;pecting his trembling and promi&s;ing people before the burning mountain; but it &s;trongly intimated to them how deceitful their hearts were, and how little would come of their &s;udden promi&s;es and hopes of a perpetual future obedience.</P>
<P>If great terror and great goodne&s;s together will affect us and work on us, we &s;hall be wro't upon. But the&s;e united will effect nothing without GOD's powerful hand.</P>
<P>Did ever any people &s;ee or hear or feel &s;uch a &s;hock of the earth, from one end of the Land to the other, and yet no hurt done to man or bea&s;t? They that have been in earthquakes in other places, in <HI>Ja|maica</HI> and in <HI>Italy</HI> tell us, that they never felt, heard and &s;aw the like. <HI>It is the LORD's doing and marvel|lous in our eyes.</HI></P>
<P>Who of us is there that can now wi&s;h GOD had not done this! It was terrible for the time, may it be joyous in the fruits and remembrance of it. Every one is ready to &s;ay, <HI>LORD that I may never forget it!</HI> Ask <HI>this</HI> of GOD humbly, and beg of him an expe|rience of &s;aving good from it.</P>
<P>If it have not a <HI>&s;anctifying</HI> effect on us, (as was hin|ted before) it will have a <HI>bad</HI> one, which GOD for|bid! If it be not for the <HI>better</HI> to us, it will be for the <HI>wor&s;e;</HI> like the <HI>other</HI> means that GOD u&s;es with men
<PB N="86" REF="002853_0092_0FE6786021FCED80">for their &s;piritual good. If we do not improve <HI>this</HI> call and warning of GOD <HI>from below</HI> to us, after the <HI>many</HI> we have had from <HI>above;</HI> it will aggravate our guilt now and our condemnation hereafter. We mu&s;t an&s;wer for <HI>this</HI> al&s;o in the day of Judgment, That after the publick In&s;tructions of the la&s;t <HI>Lord's day,</HI> GOD came at <HI>night</HI> to every family and to every per&s;on, and &s;pake to them from the <HI>Deep</HI> that lieth under; and if yet we <HI>repent not to give him glory</HI> and to &s;ave our &s;elves from wrath and ruine, we &s;hall <HI>receive the greater damnation.</HI></P>
<P>I now clo&s;e my <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e,</HI> as it hath plea&s;ed the HOLY GHOST to do the <HI>Scriptures</HI> of the <HI>Old Te&s;ta|ment: Words</HI> worthy of our mo&s;t &s;erious attention and con&s;ideration: Words full of <HI>terror</HI> to the wicked and impenitent, and as full of <HI>comfort</HI> to the penitent and obedient: Words full of proper <HI>warning</HI> and <HI>in&s;truction</HI> unto both: Mal. IV. <HI>For behold the Day cometh that &s;hall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea and all that do wickedly &s;hall be &s;tubblc; and the day that cometh &s;hall burn them up, &s;aith the LORD of ho&s;ts; that it &s;hall leave them neither root nor branch. But unto you that fear my name &s;hall the Sun of righteou&s;ne&s;s ari&s;e with healing in his wings; and ye &s;hall go forth and grow up as calves of the &s;tall.&mdash;Behold I &s;end you Elijah the Prophet be|fore the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD: And he &s;hall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, le&s;t I come and SMITE THE EARTH WITH A CURSE.</HI></P>
