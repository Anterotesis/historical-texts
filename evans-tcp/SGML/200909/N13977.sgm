<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT, BY THE TRANSLATOR.</HEAD>
<P>THE Philo&s;ophical and Political Hi&s;tory of the E&s;tabli&s;hments and Commerce of the Europeans in both the Indies, by the Abbe Raynal, is certainly one of the fine&s;t works which have appeared &s;ince the revival of letters; and perhaps the mo&s;t in&s;tructive of any which have been known. It is an original as to its formation; and ought to &s;erve henceforward for a model. An addi|tional part to this work, di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the di&s;putes of Great-Britain with her Colonies, has been long and ardently expected. In the cour&s;e of his travels, the tran&s;lator happily &s;ucceeded in obtaining a copy of this exqui&s;ite little piece, which has not yet made its appearance from any pre&s;s. He publi&s;hes a French edition, in favour of tho&s;e who will feel its eloquent rea&s;oning more forcibly in its native language, at the &s;ame time with the follow|ing tran&s;lation of it; in which he has been de&s;irous, per|haps in vain, that all the warmth, the grace, the &s;trength, the dignity of the original, &s;hould not be lo&s;t. And he flatters him&s;elf, that the indulgence of the illu&s;trious hi&s;|torian will not be wanting to a man, who, of his own motion, has taken the liberty to give this compo&s;ition to the public, only from a &s;trong per&s;ua&s;ion, that its mo|mentous argument will be u&s;eful, in a critical conjuncture, to that country which he loves with an ardour, that can be exceeded only by the nobler flame, which burns in the bo&s;om of the philanthropic author, for the freedom and happine&s;s of all the countries upon earth.</P>
<P>It may not, perhaps, be quite needle&s;s to ob&s;erve, though it ought to be under&s;tood, that the valuation of &s;ums, made in the original in foreign money, is, in the tran&s;lation, made in &s;terling.</P>
<P>The abundant good &s;en&s;e, the political &s;agacity, and even the &s;alutary &s;arca&s;m, to be found, amid&s;t the effu|&s;ions of benevolence, in this hi&s;torical tract, could never, it is apprehended, be more opportunely laid before tho&s;e

whom it may concern, than now. It now &s;eems to be the general and anxious expectation, that, before the ri|&s;ing of Parliament from its pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;ome proper and efficacious &s;teps will at la&s;t, at this high time, be thought of, towards clo&s;ing the unnatural, the &s;hameful, and di&s;tre&s;sful breach, between the mother country and her colonies; a breach in which, as it is ob&s;erved, with great truth, by the author of a Plan of Accommodation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Printed in 1780.</NOTE>, founded in ju&s;tice and liberality, <Q>The people on both &s;ides are robbed of their true&s;t intere&s;ts, and made to &s;acrifice their mutual happine&s;s, to gain nothing but contempt and mi&s;ery.</Q></P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT, FROM THE ACADEMY Of Sciences, Polite Literature, and Arts, at Lyons.</HEAD>
<P>THE Abbe Raynal, after having in&s;tructed mankind by his writings, would &s;till contribute to the im|provement of their knowledge, by exciting emulation. An A&s;&s;ociate in the labours of the Academy of Lyons, he propo&s;ed to it to give out two &s;ubjects for prizes, of which he has con&s;tituted the fund, to be di&s;tributed by the Academy, to the authors whom it &s;hall judge to have be&s;t an&s;wered the views of the propounded que&s;tions.</P>

<HEAD>THE REVOLUTION OF AMERICA.</HEAD>
<P>ENGLAND was ju&s;t di&s;engaged from a long and bloody war, in which her fleets had di&s;played the banner of victory in all &s;eas; in which a dominion, already too va&s;t, was augmented by an immen&s;e acce&s;&s;ion of territory in both the Indies. This &s;plendid face of things might have an impo&s;ing air abroad; but the na|tion was reduced within to groan for its acqui&s;itions and its triumphs. Overwhelmed with a debt of &pound;. 148,000,000 which co&s;t her an intere&s;t of &pound;. 4,959,000, &s;he was &s;carce|ly &s;ufficient to the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary expences with the five millions eight hundred thou&s;and pounds which remained to her of her revenue; and this revenue, &s;o far from be|ing capable of increa&s;e, had no certain and a&s;&s;ured con|&s;i&s;tency.</P>
<P>Land remained loaded with a higher tax than it ever had been in time of peace. New taxes had been laid on windows and on hou&s;es. The&s;e acts laid a heavy charge on all real e&s;tate. Wine, plate, cards, dice, all that was regarded as an object of luxury, or amu&s;ement, paid more than could have been thought po&s;&s;ible. To reimbur&s;e it|&s;elf for the &s;acrifice made to the pre&s;ervation of the public health, in the prohibition of &s;piritous liquors, the trea&s;ury had recour&s;e to malt, beer, cider, and all the u&s;ual beve|rages of the people. The &s;ea-ports di&s;patched nothing to foreign countries, and received nothing from them, but what was burthened cruelly with duties, on the import and the export. Raw materials and workman&s;hip were ri&s;en to &s;o high a price in Great-Britain, that her mer|chants found them&s;elves &s;upplanted in countries where they had never before experienced a competition. The
<PB N="10" REF="017686_0008_0FA21D45DC459838">
profits of her commerce, with all parts of the globe, a|mounted not annually to above two millions and a half; and, from this balance in her favour, there mu&s;t have been deducted a million and a half, paid in intere&s;t to foreigners, on their capitals placed in her public funds.</P>
<P>The &s;prings of the &s;tate were &s;trained. All the mu&s;cles of the body politic, experiencing at once a violent ten|&s;ion, were in &s;ome &s;ort di&s;placed. It was a critical mo|ment. It was nece&s;&s;ary to let the people breathe. They could not be relieved by a dimmution of expence. That of the government was nece&s;&s;ary, either to give value to conque&s;ts bought at the price of &s;o much trea&s;ure, at the price of &s;o much blood; or to re&s;train the hou&s;e of Bour|bon, angered by the humiliations of the la&s;t war, and by the &s;acrifice<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the la&s;t peace. In default of other means, to fix <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;ecurity of the pre&s;ent, and the pro&s;perity of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> future, an idea was formed of calling the colonies to the aid of the mother-country. This view was wi&s;e and ju&s;t.</P>
<P>The members of a confederacy ought all, in proportion to the extent of their powers, to contribute to its defence and to its &s;pendor, &s;ince it is by the public power alone that each cla&s;s can pre&s;erve the entire and peaceable en|joyment of its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. The indigent man has, with|out doubt, le&s;s intere&s;t in it than the rich; but he has the intere&s;t of his quiet in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and in the next, that of the pre&s;ervation of the public wealth, which he is called upon to partake of by his indu&s;try. There is no principle of &s;ociety more evident; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">et no fault in po|litics more common than its infraction. Whence can ari&s;e this perpetual contradiction between the knowledge and the conduct of tho&s;e who govern? From the vice of the legi&s;lative power, which exaggerates the maintenance of the public power, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, for its fancies, a part of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> de&s;tined to this maintenance.

ultimately into &s;till viler hands, to pay the &s;candal and the ignominy of their plea&s;ures. It is prodigally &s;quan|dered in a fa&s;tuous &s;hew of grandeur, the vain decoration of tho&s;e who cannot attain to real grandeur, and in fe&s;ti|vities and entertainments, the re&s;ource of impotent idle|ne&s;s, in the mid&s;t of the cares and labours which the right government of an empire would demand. A portion of it, it is true, is given to the public wants; but inatten|tion, and incapacity, apply it without judgment, as with|out oeconomy. Authority deceived, and which will not conde&s;cend even to make an effort at being undeceived, &s;uffers an unju&s;t di&s;tribution in the taxes, and a manner of gathering them which is it&s;elf but an oppre&s;&s;ion more. Then is every patriotic &s;entiment extingui&s;hed. A war is e&s;tabli&s;hed between the prince and &s;ubjects. They who rai&s;e the revenues of the &s;tate appear to be no other than the enemies of the citizen. He defends his fortune from taxation as he would defend it from inva&s;ion. Whatever cunning can purloin from power &s;eems lawful gain; and the &s;ubjects, corrupted by the government, make repri&s;als on the ma&s;ter by whom they are pillaged. They perceive not, that in this unequal combat, they are them&s;elves dupes and victims. The in&s;atiable and ardent trea&s;ury, le&s;s &s;atisfied with what if given, than irritated by what has been refu&s;ed, reaches eagerly, with a hundred hands, after what one alone has dared to divert from its g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ipe. It joins the activity of power to, that of intere&s;t. Vex|ations are multiplied, under the &s;pecious name of cha&s;ti&s;e|ment and ju&s;tice; and the mon&s;ter who beggars all tho&s;e whom he torments, thanks heaven devoutly for the num|ber of the criminals who have been puni&s;hed by him, and of the crimes by which he is enriched. Happy the &s;ove|reign who &s;hould not di&s;dain, for the prevention of &s;o many abu&s;es, to render to his &s;ubjects a faithful account of the employment of the &s;ums he might exact! But this &s;overeign has not yet appeared; and, without doubt, he never will appear. The debt, however, of the protected people, towards the protector &s;tate, is not a le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary and &s;acred tie; and no nation has di&s;owned it. The En|li&s;h colonies in North-America had not given an example
<PB N="12" REF="017686_0010_0FA21D4772C75BF0">
of it; and never had the Briti&s;h mini&s;try recour&s;e to them without obtaining the &s;uccour it &s;olicited.</P>
<P>But this &s;uccour was granted in gifts, and not in taxes, &s;ince the conce&s;&s;ion of it was preceded by free and public deliberations in the a&s;&s;emblies of each e&s;tabli&s;hment. The mother-country had found her&s;elf engaged in expen&s;ive and cruel wars. Tumultuous and enterpri&s;ing parliaments had di&s;turbed her tranquillity. She had fallen into the hands of mini&s;ters corrupt and bold; unhappily di&s;po&s;ed to rai&s;e the authority of the throne upon the ruin of all the rights, and all the powers of the people. And even re|volutions had taken place, before an attack upon a cu&s;|tom, &s;tabli&s;hed and &s;trengthened by the happy experience of two ages, had ever once been dreamed of.</P>
<P>The colonies in the new world had been accu&s;tomed to regard this mode of furni&s;hing their contingent, in men and money, as a right. Had this preten&s;ion been doubt|ful, or erroneous, prudence would have forbidden its be|ing too openly attacked. The art of maintaining autho|rity is a delicate art, which requires more circum&s;pection than is generally thought. They who govern, are, per|haps, too much accu&s;tomed to hold men in contempt. They regard them too much as &s;laves, &s;ubdued and bent down by nature, whil&s;t they are only &s;o from habit. If you lay on them a new load, take care le&s;t they &s;hake it off with fury and with intere&s;t. Forget not that the lever of power has no other fulcrum than opinion; that the power of tho&s;e who govern, is, in reality, but the power of tho&s;e who &s;uffer government. Remind not people at|tentively occupied by their labours, or &s;leeping in their chains, to lift up their eyes to truth too terrible for you; and whil&s;t they are obeying, bring not to their remem|brance their right to command. When the moment of this fearful rou&s;ing &s;hall arrive; when they &s;hall have thought in earne&s;t that they are not made for their ma|gi&s;trates, but that their magi&s;trates are made for them; when they &s;hall once have been able to bring them&s;elves together, to feel the communication of kindred minds, and to pronounce with a voice unanimous; <HI>We will not have this law; this practice it offen&s;ive;</HI> medium is no

more; you will be con&s;trained, by an unavoidable alter|native, either to puni&s;h or to yield; either to be tyran|nical or weak; and your authority henceforth dete&s;ted or de&s;pi&s;ed, whichever part it take, will have to chu&s;e from the people but their upon in&s;olence, or their hidden ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t duty, therefore, of a wi&s;e admini&s;tration, is to manage the prevailing opinions in any country: for opinion is the property mo&s;t dear to man, dearer even than his life, and con&s;equently much dearer than his wealth. A wi&s;e admini&s;tration may, without doubt, en|deavour to rectify opinions by information, or to altar them by per&s;ua&s;ion, if they tend to the diminution of the public power. But it is not permitted to thwart them without nece&s;&s;ity; and there never was any nece&s;&s;ity for rejecting the &s;y&s;tem adopted by North-America.</P>
<P>In effect, whether the different &s;ettlements in this new world had been authorized, as they wi&s;hed, to &s;end re|pre&s;entatives to parliament, where they might have deli|berated with their fellow-citizens on the nece&s;&s;ities of the Briti&s;h empire at large; or, whether they had continued to examine within them&s;elves what &s;hould be the contri|bution which it was right for them to make, no inconve|nience could have re&s;ulted from it to the trea&s;ury. In one ca&s;e, the voice of their delegated claimants would have been drowned in that of the majority; and the&s;e provin|ces would have found them&s;elves legally loaded with &s;uch a portion of the burden as it &s;hould be wi&s;hed to make them bear. In the other, the mini&s;try, continuing to di&s;po&s;e of the dignities, the employments, the pen&s;ions, and even of the elections, would have experienced no more re&s;i&s;tance to its will in that hemi&s;phere than in this.</P>
<P>But the maxims con&s;ecrated by cu&s;tom in America were not founded in prejudice alone. The preten&s;ions of the coloni&s;ts re&s;ted on the nature of their charters, and on the &s;till more &s;olid ba&s;is of that right of every Engli&s;h &s;ubject, not to be taxed without con&s;ent, expre&s;&s;ed by him&s;elf or his repre&s;entative. This right, which ought to be that of every people, &s;ince it is founded on the eternal law of rea&s;on, originated &s;o far back as in the reign of the fir&s;t Edward. From that epoch the Engli&s;hman has never
<PB N="14" REF="017686_0012_0FA21D48C24F4B18">
lo&s;t &s;ight of it. In peace, in war, under weak or wicked kings, in &s;lavi&s;h or tumultuous times, it has been his un|permitted claim. Under the Tudors, this Engli&s;hman has been &s;een to give up &s;ome of his mo&s;t precious privileges, and, unre&s;i&s;tingly, to &s;ubmit his neck to the axe of ty|rants; but never to renounce the right of &s;elf-taxation. It was in the defence of it that he has &s;hed rivers of blood, that he has puni&s;hed or dethroned his kings. In &s;hort, at the Revolution in 1688, this right was &s;olemnly ac|knowledged, by the celebrated act, in which liberty was &s;oon to trace, with the &s;ame hand with which it had dri|ven out the royal de&s;pot, the conditions of the contract between a nation and the &s;overeign it had newly cho&s;en. This prerogative of a people, much more &s;acred, without all que&s;tion, than &s;o many imaginary rights which &s;uper|&s;tition would &s;anctify in tyrants, was, with regard to England, at once both the in&s;trument and the rampart of her liberty.

Di&s;per&s;ed throughout an immen&s;e continent; free as the wild na|ture which &s;urrounds them, amid&s;t their rocks, their mountains, the va&s;t plains of their de&s;erts, on the confines of tho&s;e fore&s;ts in which all is &s;till in its &s;avage &s;tate, and where there are no traces of either the &s;lavery or the ty|ranny of man, they &s;eem to receive from every natural ob|ject a le&s;&s;on of liberty and independence. Be&s;ides, the&s;e people, given up almo&s;t all of them to agriculture and to commerce, to u&s;eful labours, which elevate and fortify the &s;oul in in&s;piring &s;imple manners, hitherto as far re|moved from riches as from poverty, cannot be yet cor|rupted either by the exce&s;s of luxury, or by the exce&s;s of want. It is in this &s;tate above all others, that the man who enjoys liberty is mo&s;t capable to maintain it, and to &s;hew him&s;elf jealous in the defence of an hereditary right, which &s;eems to be the mo&s;t certain &s;ecurity for all the re&s;t. Such was the re&s;olution of the Americans.</P>
<P>Whether the Briti&s;h mini&s;try were ignorant of the&s;e di&s;|po&s;itions, of whether they hoped that their delegates would &s;ucceed in changing them, they laid hold of the moment of a glorious peace for exacting a forced contri|bution from the colonies. For war, and let it be well remarked, war, whether unfortunate or &s;ucce&s;sful, &s;erves always as a pretext for the u&s;urpations of governments; as if the directors of the warring powers propo&s;ed to them|&s;elves by it le&s;s to vanqui&s;h their enemies, than to en&s;lave their &s;ubjects. The year 1764 &s;aw the birth of the fa|mous &s;tamp act, which forbid the admi&s;&s;ion in the courts of ju&s;tice of any in&s;trument which &s;hould not be written on paper marked and &s;old for the profit of the Briti&s;h trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h provinces of North America become in|dignant at this u&s;urpation of their mo&s;t precious and mo&s;t &s;acred rights. By an unanimous agreement they renounce the con&s;umption of whatever was furni&s;hed them by the mother country, 'till it &s;hould have withdrawn this ille|gal and oppre&s;&s;ive bid.

the men, animated by this example, give up on their part other conveniencies and enjoyments. Many cultivators of land quit the plough, to form them&s;elves to the indu&s;try of the work&s;hop; and wool, flax, and cotton, coar&s;ely wrought, are &s;old at the price which would before have purcha&s;ed the fine&s;t cloths and the mo&s;t beautiful &s;tuffs.</P>
<P>This kind of con&s;piracy &s;tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the government. By the clamour of the merchants, who&s;e wares are without vent, its inquietude is increa&s;ed. The enemies of the mini&s;try uphold the&s;e di&s;contents; and the &s;tamp-act is revoked after two years of a convul&s;ive agitation, which, in other times, would have lighted up a civil war.</P>
<P>But the triumph of the colonies is of &s;hort duration. The parliament, which had retreated but with extreme repugnance, ordains, in 1767, that the revenue which could not be obtained by means of &s;tamps, &s;hould be rai|&s;ed by taxes on the gla&s;s, the lead, the pa&s;te-board, the colours, the paper-hangings, and the tea, which are car|ried from England to America. The people of the North|ern Continent are not le&s;s revolted at this innovation than at the former. In vain are they told that no one could di&s;pute the right of Great-Britain to lay on her exporta|tions the duties which her intere&s;t demands, &s;ince &s;he de|nies not to her colonies, &s;ituated beyond the &s;eas, the li|berty of fabricating them&s;elves the wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es &s;ubjected to the new taxation. This &s;ubterfuge appears but as a deri&s;ion to men, who, being cultivators of land alone, and redu|ced to the having no communication but with their mo|ther-country, cannot procure, either by their own in|du&s;try, or by foreign connections, the objects which had recently been taxed. Whether this tribute be paid in the old or new world, they perceive that the word makes no alteration in the thing, and that their liberty would not be le&s;s attacked by this mode, than by that which had been repelled by them with &s;ucce&s;s. The coloni&s;ts &s;ea clearly that the government would beguile them; and they will not be beguiled. The&s;e political &s;ophi&s;ms ap|pear to them as they are, the ma&s;k of tyranny.</P>
<P>Nations in general are made more for feeling than for thinking. The greate&s;t part of them never had an

idea of analy&s;ing the nature of the power by which they are governed. They obey without reflection, and becau&s;e they have the habit of obeying. The origin and the ob|ject of the fir&s;t national a&s;&s;ociations being unknown to them, all re&s;i&s;tance to government appears to them a crime. It is chiefly in tho&s;e &s;tates where the principles of legi&s;lation are confounded with tho&s;e of religion, that this blindne&s;s is to be met with. The habit of believing, fa|vours the habit of &s;uffering. Man renounces not any one object with impunity. It &s;eems as if nature would re|venge her&s;elf upon him who dares thus to degrade her. The &s;ervile di&s;po&s;ition which &s;he &s;tamps upon his &s;oul in con&s;equence, extends it&s;elf throughout. It makes a duty of re&s;ignation as of meanne&s;s; and ki&s;&s;ing chains of all kinds with re&s;pect, trembles to examine either its doc|trines or its laws. In the &s;ame manner that a &s;ingle ex|travagance in religious opinions is &s;ufficient to make many more to be adopted by minds once deceived, a fir&s;t u&s;ur|pation of government opens the door to all the re&s;t. He who believes the greater, believes the le&s;s; he who can do the greater, can do the le&s;s. It is by this double abu&s;e of credulity and authority, that all the ab&s;urdities in mat|ters of religion and of policy have been introduced into the world for the hara&s;&s;ing and the cru&s;hing of the hu|man race. Thus, at the fir&s;t &s;ignal of liberty among&s;t na|tions, they have been prompted to &s;hake off both the&s;e yokes together; and the epoch in which the human mind began to di&s;cu&s;s the abu&s;es of the church and clergy, is that in which rea&s;on perceived at la&s;t the rights of men; and in which courage attempted to &s;et the fir&s;t limits to de&s;potic power. The principles of toleration and of li|berty, e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Engli&s;h colonies, had made them a different people from all others. There it was known what was the dignity of man; and when the Briti&s;h mi|ni&s;try violated it, it could not be otherwi&s;e but that a peo|ple all compo&s;ed of denizens, &s;hould ri&s;e again&s;t the wick|edne&s;s of the attempt.</P>
<P>Three years elap&s;ed, without a revenue from any one of the taxes which had &s;o wounded the Americans to the quick. This was &s;omething: but it was not all to which

They <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;i&s;ted upon a general and formal renunciation of what had been &s;o illegally ordained; and this &s;atisfaction was given them in 1770. Tea only was excepted. But the object of this exception was only to palliate the &s;hame of entirely giving up the &s;uperiority of the mother country <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ver her colonies: for this duty was not more cogently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">xacted than the others had been.</P>
<P>The mini&s;try, deceived by their delegates, believed un|doubtedly that the di&s;po&s;ition of the new world was alter|ed, when, in 1773, they ordered the collection of the duty upon tea.</P>
<P>At this news the indignation becomes general in North-America. In &s;ome provinces, formal thanks are agreed upon to be rendered to the ma&s;ters of ve&s;&s;els who would not &s;uffer this production to make any part of their cargo. In others, the merchants to whom it is con&s;igned will not receive it. Here, he is declared an enemy of his country who &s;hall dare to vend it. There, they are &s;tig|matized with the &s;ame reproach who &s;hall keep it in their &s;tores. Many provinces &s;olemnly renounce the u&s;e of this elegant refre&s;hment. A &s;till greater number burn what they had remaining of this leaf, 'till then the object of their delight. The tea &s;ent to this part of the globe was valued at more than two hundred thou&s;and pounds; and not a &s;ingle che&s;t of it was landed. Bo&s;ton was the prin|cipal theatre of this in&s;urrection. Its inhabitants de&s;troy|ed, in their very port, three cargoes of tea which arrived from Europe.</P>
<P>This great town had always appeared more occupied by a &s;en&s;e of its rights than the re&s;t of America. The lea&s;t attempt that was made upon their privileges had been repelled without &s;cruple and without re&s;erve. This re|&s;i&s;tance, &s;ometimes not unaccompanied by tumult, had for &s;ome years been tire&s;ome to government. The mini|&s;try who had a vengeance to wreak, &s;eized too eagerly upon the circum&s;tance of a blameable exce&s;s; and requi|red the parliament to puni&s;h it &s;everely.</P>
<P>Moderate men wi&s;hed that the offending town might be &s;entenced only to an indemnification proportioned to

This &s;entence was thought too &s;light; and on the 13th of March, 1774, a bill was pa&s;&s;ed for &s;hut|ting up the port of Bo&s;ton, and forbidding any thing to be landed or loaded at it.</P>
<P>The court of London applauded it&s;elf for &s;o rigorous a law, and doubted not but that it would bring the Bo&s;toni|ans to that di&s;po&s;ition to &s;lavery which it had vainly la|boured 'till then to give them. If, contrary to all ap|pearance, the&s;e &s;turdy men &s;hould per&s;evere in their pre|ten&s;ions, their neighbours would be ardent in profiting from the interdiction laid upon the principal harbour of the province. Suppo&s;ing the wor&s;t, the other colonies, long &s;ince jealous of that of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, would aban|don it with indifference to its melancholy fate, and gather up the immen&s;e trade which would flow in to them on the tide of its misfortunes. By the&s;e means would be broken the union of the&s;e different e&s;tabli&s;hments, which had for &s;ome years pa&s;t acquired a greater degree of con&s;i&s;tency than was plea&s;ing to the mother-country.</P>
<P>The expectation of the mini&s;try was totally deceived. An act of rigour &s;ometimes over-awes. The people who have murmured as long as the thunder-&s;torm grow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed on|ly at a di&s;tance, when it comes to bur&s;t upon them, fre|quently &s;ubmit. It is then that they weigh the advanta|ges and di&s;advantages of re&s;i&s;tance; that they contem|plate their own &s;trength and that of their oppre&s;&s;ors; that a panic terror &s;eizes tho&s;e who have every thing to lo&s;e, without any thing to gain; that they lift up their voice, that they intimidate, that they corrupt; that divi&s;ion ari&s;es in the minds of men, and that the community is &s;eparated into two factions, which irritate each other, which come oftentimes to blows, and cut each other's throats under the eyes of their tyrants, who, with &s;weet complacency, behold their &s;treaming blood. But tyrants &s;eldom find accomplices but among&s;t a people already cor|rupted to their hands. It it vice which gives them allies among&s;t tho&s;e whom they oppre&s;s. It is humanly &s;oft|ne&s;s, which, filled with terrors, dares not barter its re|po&s;e
<PB N="20" REF="017686_0018_0FA21D4D46250368">
for honourable peril. It is the vile ambition to com|mand, which lends its arm to de&s;potic power, and con|&s;ents to be a &s;lave in order to domineer; to give up a peo|ple in order to partake their &s;poil; and to renounce real honour for the obtaining of titles, the nick-names of ho|nour. It is, above all, the indifferent and cold per&s;on|ality, which is the la&s;t vice among&s;t a people, the la&s;t crime of governments, for it is ever the government which gives it birth; it is that, which, from principle, &s;acrifices a nation to a man, and the happine&s;s of an age and of po&s;terity to the enjoyment of a day and of a moment. None of the&s;e vices, the production of a &s;ociety opulent and voluptuous, of a &s;ociety grown old and verging to its end, belong to a people newly e&s;tabli&s;hed and occu|pied in u&s;eful labours. The Americans remained united. The execution of a bill, which they called inhuman, bar|barous, and bloody, tended but to &s;trengthen them in the re&s;olution of maintaining their rights with the more ac|cord and con&s;tancy.</P>
<P>At Bo&s;ton, the acrid and ardent &s;pirit is more and more exalted. The try of religion adds force to that of liberty. The hou&s;es of wor&s;hip re echo with the mo&s;t vi|olent exhortations again&s;t England. It was, without doubt, an intere&s;ting &s;pectacle for philo&s;ophy, to &s;ee that even in temples, at the foot of altars, where &s;uper&s;tition has &s;o often ble&s;&s;ed the chains of nations, where prie&s;ts have &s;o often flattered tyrants, liberty lifted up her voice in defence of the privileges of an oppre&s;&s;ed people; and if it can be thought that the Deity vouch&s;afes to look down upon the unhappy feuds of men, it was better plea&s;|ed undoubtedly to &s;ee its &s;anctuary con&s;ecrated to this u&s;e, and hymns to liberty make a part of the wor&s;hip by which it was addre&s;&s;ed. The&s;e exhortations of the preach|ers mu&s;t have had a great effect; and when a free people invokes heaven again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion, it delays not long to have recour&s;e to arms.</P>
<P>The other inhabitants of the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts di&s;dain even the idea of drawing the lea&s;t advantage from the ci&s;a&s;ters of the capital. They think but of drawing clo&s;er the bonds which unite them with the Bo&s;tonians,

<P>All the provinces attach them&s;elves to the cau&s;e of Bo&s;|ton; and their affection increa&s;es in proportion to the &s;ufferings of this unhappy town. Nearly as culpable of a re&s;i&s;tance &s;o &s;everely puni&s;hed, they are well aware that the mother country but defers her vengeance again&s;t them; and that all the grace with which the mo&s;t favoured can be flattered, is to be the la&s;t on which the hand of op|pre&s;&s;ion &s;hall be doomed to fall.</P>
<P>The&s;e di&s;po&s;itions to a general in&s;urrection are aug|mented by the act again&s;t Bo&s;ton, which is &s;een circulating throughout the continent upon paper edged with black, emblematical of mourning for liberty departed. Soon the di&s;quietude communicates it&s;elf from hou&s;e to hou&s;e. The inhabitants a&s;&s;emble and conver&s;e together in the public places: and writings, full of eloquence and vigour, are delivered every where from the pre&s;s.</P>
<P>"The &s;everities of the Briti&s;h Parliament again&s;t Bo&s;|ton (&s;ay they in the&s;e writings) &s;hould cau&s;e all the Ame|rican provinces to tremble.

<P>This di&s;po&s;ition was the common one: but the impor|tant object, the difficult thing, in the mid&s;t of a general tumult, was to contrive that a calm might be brought on, by favour of which might be formed a concert of wills, to give dignity, &s;trength, and con&s;i&s;tency, to their re&s;olu|tions. It is this concert, which, of a multitude of &s;cat|tered parts, and each ea&s;ily to be broken, compo&s;es a whole that is not to be rendered tractable, unle&s;s it be to be divided by policy or by power. The nece&s;&s;ity of this grand combination, or totality, is &s;trikingly perceived by the provinces of New-Hamp&s;hire, of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, of Rhode-I&s;land, of Connecticut, of New York, of New-Jer&s;ey, of the Delaware counties, of Maryland, of Penn|&s;ylvania, of Virginia, and of both the Carolinas.

<P>The di&s;putes of the mother country with her colonies, a&s;&s;ume at this period an importance to which they had not been before intitled. It is no longer a few individuals who make an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance to imperious ma&s;ters. It is the &s;truggle of one body of men again&s;t another; of the Congre&s;s of America again&s;t the Parliament of En|gland; of a nation again&s;t a nation. By the re&s;olutions taken on either &s;ide, minds mutually are heated. The ferment of animo&s;ity increa&s;es. All hope of reconciliation vani&s;hes. On each &s;ide the &s;word is whetted.

<P>This &s;ucce&s;s was the fir&s;t &s;tep of Engli&s;h America to|wards the revolution. It was begun to be openly de&s;ired. The principles which ju&s;tified it were di&s;per&s;ed on all &s;ides. The&s;e principles, which were indebted for their birth to Europe, and particularly to England, had been tran&s;planted in America by philo&s;ophy.

<P>Man, thrown, as it were, by chance, upon this globe, &s;urrounded by all the evils of nature; obliged continually to defend and protect his life again&s;t the &s;torms and tem|pe&s;ts of the air, again&s;t the inundations of water, again&s;t the fire of volcanos, again&s;t the intemperature of frigid or torrid zones, again&s;t the &s;terility of the earth, which refu&s;es him aliment, or its baneful fecundity, which makes p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;ons &s;pring up beneath his feet; in &s;hort, again&s;t the claws and teeth of &s;avage bea&s;ts, who di&s;pute with him

his habitation and his prey, and, attacking his per&s;on, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">em re&s;olved to render them&s;elves rulers of this globe, of which he thinks him&s;elf to be the ma&s;ter: man in this &s;tate, alone and abandoned to him&s;elf, could do nothing for his pre&s;ervation. It was nece&s;&s;ary, therefore, that he &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uld unite him&s;elf, and a&s;&s;ociate with his like, in order to bring together their &s;trength and intelligence in common &s;tock. It is by this union that he has triumphed over &s;o many evils, that he has fa&s;hioned this globe to his u&s;e, re&s;trained the rivers, &s;ubjugated the &s;eas, in&s;ured his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, conquered a part of the animals in obli|ging them to &s;erve him, and driven others far from his empire, to the depths of de&s;erts or of woods, where their number dimini&s;hes from age to age. What a man alone would not have been able to effect, men have executed in concert; and all together they pre&s;erve their work. Such is the origin, &s;uch the advantage and the end of all &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Government owes its birth to the nece&s;&s;ity of prevent|ing and repre&s;&s;ing the injuries which the a&s;&s;ociated indi|viduals had to fear from one another. It is the &s;entinel who watches, in order that the common labours be not di&s;turbed.</P>
<P>Thus &s;ociety originates in the wants of men, govern|ment in their vices. Society tends always to good; go|vernment ought always to tend to the repre&s;&s;ing of evil. Society is the fir&s;t, it is in its origin independent and free; government was in&s;tituted for it, and is but its in&s;tru|ment. It is for one to command; it is for the other to obey. Society created the public power; government, which has received it from &s;ociety, ought to con&s;ecrate it entirely to its u&s;e. In &s;hort, &s;ociety is e&s;&s;entially good; government, as is well known, may be, and is but too often, evil.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid that we were all born equal; that is not &s;o: that we had all the &s;ame rights. I am ignorant of what are rights, where there is an inequality of talents, or of &s;trength, and no &s;ecurity nor &s;anction: that nature offered to us all the &s;ame dwelling, and the &s;ame re&s;our|ces; that is not &s;o: that we are all endowed indifferently
<PB N="26" REF="017686_0024_0FA21D54032920B8">
with the &s;ame means of defence; that is not &s;o: and&punc; know not in what &s;en&s;e it can be true, that we all enjoy the &s;ame qualities of mind and body.</P>
<P>There is among&s;t men an original inequality which no|thing can remedy. It mu&s;t la&s;t for ever; and all that can be obtained by the be&s;t legi&s;lation, is, not to de&s;troy it, but to prevent the abu&s;e of it.</P>
<P>But in making di&s;tinctions between her children, like a &s;tep mother, in creating &s;ome children &s;trong and others weak, has not nature her&s;elf formed the germe or princi|ple of tyranny? I do not think it can be denied; e&s;pe|cially if we look back to a time anterior to all legi&s;lation, a time in which man will be &s;een as pa&s;&s;ionate and as void of rea&s;on as a brute.</P>
<P>What then have founders of nations, what have legi|&s;lators propo&s;ed to them&s;elves? To obviate all the di&s;|a&s;ters ari&s;ing from this germe when it is expanded, by a &s;ort of artificial equality, which might reduce all the mem|bers of a &s;ociety, without exception, under an impartial, &s;ole authority. It is a &s;word which moves gently, equa|bly, and indifferently, over every head: but this &s;word was ideal. It was nece&s;&s;ary that there &s;hould be a hand, a corporeal being who &s;hould hold it.</P>
<P>What has re&s;ulted thence? Why, that the hi&s;tory of civilized man is but the hi&s;tory of his mi&s;ery. All the pages of it are &s;tained with blood; &s;ome with the blood of the oppre&s;&s;ors, the others with the blood of the op|pre&s;&s;ed.</P>

as of their duration, are they obligatory upon their de|&s;cendants? There is no &s;uch thing: and it is impo&s;&s;ible that you Engli&s;hmen, who have &s;ucce&s;&s;ively undergone &s;o many different revolutions in your political con&s;titution, to&s;&s;ed as you have been from monarchy to tyranny, from tyranny to ari&s;tocracy, from ari&s;tocracy to democracy, and from democracy to anarchy; it is impo&s;&s;ible that you, without accu&s;ing your&s;elves of rebellion and of perjury, can think otherwi&s;e than I do.</P>
<P>We examine things with a philo&s;ophic eye; and it is well known, that it is not the &s;peculations of philo&s;ophers which bring on civil troubles. No &s;ubjects are more pa|tient than we are. I proceed then in pur&s;uit of my ob|ject, without any cau&s;e to fear that mi&s;chief can follow from my rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>If the people are happy under their form of govern|ment, they will keep it. If they are unhappy, it will not be either your opinions or mine, it will be the impo&s;&s;ibi|lity of &s;uffering more, and longer, which will determine them to change it; a &s;alutary impul&s;e, which the oppre&s;|&s;or will call revolt, though it be but the ju&s;t exerci&s;e of a natural and unalienable right of the man who is oppre&s;&s;ed, and even of the man who is not oppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>A man wills and chu&s;es for him&s;elf. He cannot will nor chu&s;e for another; and it would be a madne&s;s to will and to chu&s;e for him who is yet unborn, for him who will not yet exi&s;t for ages. There is no individual but who, di&s;contented with the form of the government of his coun|try, may go el&s;ewhere to &s;eek a better. There is no &s;o|ciety but which has the &s;ame right to change, as their an|ce&s;tors had to adopt, their form of government. Upon this point, it is with &s;ocieties as if they were at the fir&s;t moment of their civilizaiion. Without which there would be a great evil; nay, the greate&s;t of evils would be with|out a remedy. Millions of men would be condemned to mi&s;ery without end. Conclude then with me.</P>
<P>That there is no form of government which has the prerogative to be immutable.</P>
<P>No political authority, which, created ye&s;terday, or a thou&s;and years ago, may not be ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ogated in ten years time or to-morrow.</P>

<P>Whoever thinks otherwi&s;e is a madman, who devotes him&s;elf to eternal mi&s;ery, who devotes to it his family, his children, and his children's children, in allowing to his ance&s;tors the right of &s;tipulating for him when he ex|i&s;ted not, and in arrogating to him&s;elf the right of &s;tipu|lating for a progeny which does not yet exi&s;t.</P>
<P>All authority in this world has begun either by the con&s;ent of the &s;ubjects, or by the power of the ma&s;ter. In both one and the other ca&s;e, it may ju&s;tly end. There is no pre&s;cription in favour of tyranny again&s;t liberty.</P>

<P>"In order to make us &s;u&s;pend our blows, and di&s;arm our hands, we have been told, and told repeatedly, that the land is peopled by our countrymen, by our friends, by our brethren.

<P>Until this memorable period, the Americans had con|fined them&s;elves to a re&s;i&s;tance, authorized even by the Engli&s;h laws.

<P>Never, &s;ays the author of this celebrated performance, never did a more grand concernment call for the attention of the world. It is not that of a city or a province, it is that of an immen&s;e continent, and of a con&s;iderable por|tion of the globe. It is not the affair of a day, it is that of ages. The pre&s;ent is about to decide upon a long fu|turity; and many hundreds of years after that we &s;hall be no more, the &s;un, in illuminating this hemi&s;phere, will il|luminate our glory, or expo&s;e our &s;hame. A long time did we &s;peak of peace and reconcilement: all is changed, On the day when, in con&s;equence of the recour&s;e which has been had to arms, the fir&s;t drop of blood was &s;hed, time for di&s;qui&s;ition pa&s;&s;ed away. A day has given birth to a revolution. A day has tran&s;ported us to another age.</P>
<P>Timid &s;ouls, &s;ouls who mea&s;ure the future by the pa&s;t, think that we &s;tand in need of the protection of England. That protection might be u&s;eful to a ri&s;ing colony; it is become dangerous for a nation formed. Infancy mu&s;t needs be &s;upported, in its weak endeavours to walk; youth &s;hould march actively and freely, in power and pride of port.

will entail upon America the dower of perpetual war. Let us part, let us part. Neutrality, trade and peace; &s;uch, and &s;uch only, can be the foundations of our great|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>The authority of Great-Britain over America mu&s;t &s;ooner or later be extinct. So wills nature, nece&s;&s;ity, and time. The Engli&s;h government can, therefore, give us only a tran&s;ient con&s;titution; and we &s;hall bequeath to our po&s;terity but debts, and di&s;&s;entions, and a precarion &s;tate. If we would in&s;ure their happine&s;s, let us part. If we are fathers, if we love our children, let us part. Laws and liberty are the heritage we owe them.</P>
<P>England is too far removed from us; we cannot be go|verned by &s;uch a di&s;tant country. What, to traver&s;e, al|ways, two thou&s;and leagues, to claim ju&s;tice, or to a&s;k for laws! to exculpate our&s;elves from imaginary crimes, or &s;olicit, with meanne&s;s, the court and mini&s;ters of a fo|reign clime! What, to wait for years for every an&s;wer; and to find, as we might too often, when we had cro&s;&s;ed and recro&s;&s;ed the ocean, that inju&s;tice only would be the product of our voyage! No; to be a great &s;tate, the cen|tre and the &s;eat of power mu&s;t be in the &s;tate it&s;elf. No|thing but the de&s;poti&s;m of the Ea&s;t can inure men thus to receive their laws from rulers far remote, or from the ba|&s;haws, by whom invi&s;ible tyrants are repre&s;ented. But let it not be forgotten, that the more the di&s;tance is aug|mented, the more ponderous and cruel is the pre&s;&s;ure of the de&s;potic power; and the people then, deprived of al|mo&s;t all the advantages of government, feel only its mi|&s;eries and its vices.</P>
<P>Nature did not create a world to &s;ubject it to the inha|bitants of an i&s;land. Nature has e&s;tabli&s;hed the laws of equilibrium, which &s;he every where ob&s;erves, in the hea|vens as well as upon the earth. By the laws of bodies, and of di&s;tances, America can belong but to it&s;elf.</P>
<P>There is no government without a mutual confidence between him who commands and him who obeys. It is all over; this mutual confidence is gone, and never can return. England has too clearly &s;hewn that &s;he would command us like &s;laves; America, that &s;he was equally

us! Ah, we &s;hould then be but a vile object of pity|ing wonder to Europe, of indignation to America, and of contempt even to our enemies. If we can obey them, we had not the right to combat them. Liberty only can ab&s;olve us. Liberty, and perfect liberty, is the only ob|ject worthy of our labours and our dangers. What do I &s;ay? From this moment it is our own. Our title is writ|ten on the bloody plains of Lexington; it was there that the hand of England tore the contract by which we were united to her. Yes. At the moment when the report of the fir&s;t mu&s;quet di&s;charged by England was heard, na|ture her&s;elf proclaimed us free and independent.</P>
<P>Let us profit by the benefit of foes. The youth of na|tions is the age mo&s;t favourable to their independence. It is the time of energy and vigour. Our &s;ouls are not yet &s;urrounded by that apparatus of luxury, which &s;erves as ho&s;tage to a tyrant. Our arms are not yet enervated in the arts of &s;oftne&s;s. Among&s;t us are not &s;een to domineer tho&s;e nobles, who, by their very con&s;titution, are the ne|ce&s;&s;ary allies of kings; who love not liberty, but when they can make of it an in&s;trument of oppre&s;&s;ion; tho&s;e no|bles, eager for privilege and title, for whom, in critical conjunctures, the people are but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ools, for whom the &s;u|preme power is a ready corruptor.</P>
<P>Your colonies are formed of plain, brave, laborious, upright men, proprietors and cultivators of their land in one. Liberty is their fir&s;t want. Rural labours have al|ready hardened them for war. Public enthu&s;ia&s;m brings to light unknown talents. It is in revolutions that great minds are formed, that heroes &s;how them&s;elves, and take their place. Remember Holland, and all her &s;ons; and that number of extraordinary men to which the quarrel of her liberty gave birth: behold in the&s;e men an example for you; remember their &s;ucce&s;s, and behold a pre&s;age.</P>
<P>Let our fir&s;t &s;tep be to form a con&s;titution by which we may be united. The moment is arrived. Later, it would be abandoned to an uncertain fururity and the caprice of chance.

<P>Let the moment, which, in re&s;pect to us, is &s;ingular, be &s;eized on. We have it in our power to frame the fine&s;t con&s;titution that the world has &s;een.

We are this family. De&s;poti&s;m has deluged all; and we can a &s;econd time renew the world.</P>
<P>We are about, at this moment, to decide the fate of a race of men more numerous, perhaps, than all the peo|ple of Europe put together. Shall we wait till we may be the prey of a conqueror, and &s;uffer the hope of the uni|ver&s;e to be de&s;troyed? Imagine to your&s;elves, that all the generations of the world to come, have at this moment their eyes fixed on us, and demand of us their liberty. We are about to fix their de&s;tiny: If we give them up, they will, perhaps, one day, drag their chains acro&s;s our tombs, and load them with imprecations.</P>
<P>Call to mind a writing which has appeared among&s;t you, and had for a motto, UNITE OR DIE.</P>

<P>A &s;tep which broke the ties formed by blood, by reli|gion, and by habit, was to be &s;upported by a grand con|cert of wills, by wi&s;e and vigorous mea&s;ures.

<P>Each province had an a&s;&s;embly formed by the repre|&s;entatives of the different di&s;tricts, and in which the le|gi&s;lative power re&s;ided.

<P>But &s;ome people have thought that the in&s;titution of this body was not &s;o well contrived as the legi&s;lation of the provinces. It &s;eems, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that fede|rate &s;tates, which rai&s;e them&s;elves from the condition of &s;ubjects up to that of being independent, cannot, without danger, tru&s;t their delegates with the unlimited power of making peace and war.

It &s;eems, that in the&s;e times of revolution, the public will cannot be too well known, too literally pronounced. It is nece&s;&s;ary, undoubtedly, they &s;ay, that all the mea|&s;ures, all the operations, which relate to the common de|fence and offence, &s;hould be decided on by the common

repre&s;entatives of the body of the &s;tate: but the continu|ation of war, and the conditions of peace, ought to be deliberated upon in every province; and the deliberations to be tran&s;mitted to the congre&s;s by the deputies, who would &s;ubmit the opinion of their provinces to the plura|lity of voices. In &s;hort, they add, that if in e&s;tabli&s;hed governments it is proper that the people &s;hould rely with confidence in the wi&s;dom of their &s;enate, in a &s;tate where the con&s;titution is forming, where the people, as yet un|certain of their fate, call for their liberty, &s;word in hand, it is nece&s;&s;ary that all the citizens &s;hould be continually in council, in camp, in the public places, and have their eyes continually open upon the repre&s;entatives to whom their de&s;tiny has been committed.</P>
<P>Though the&s;e principles are true in general, there might be a difficulty, we may an&s;wer, in applying them to the new republic formed by the Americans. It is not with that republic as with the federate republics which we &s;ee in Europe, I mean Holland and Switzerland, which oc|cupy a country but of &s;mall extent, and in which it is ea&s;y to e&s;tabli&s;h a rapid communication between all the provinces. The &s;ame thing may be &s;aid of the confede|racies of ancient Greece. The&s;e &s;tates were &s;ituated at a &s;mall di&s;tance from each other, confined almo&s;t within the narrow compa&s;s of the Peloponne&s;us, or, at mo&s;t, within the limits of the Archipelago. But the United States of America, di&s;per&s;ed over an immen&s;e continent; occupy|ing in the new world a &s;pace of almo&s;t fifteen degrees; &s;eparated by de&s;arts, by mountains, by gulfs, and by a va&s;t extent of coa&s;t, cannot have the advantage of this ra|pid communication. If the general congre&s;s could not de|cide upon political intere&s;ts without the particular delibe|rations of each province; if on every important occa&s;ion, on every unfore&s;een event, it &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary to give new in&s;tructions, and, as we may &s;ay, a new power to the repre&s;entatives, this body would remain inactive. The di&s;tances to be pa&s;&s;ed, the delays and the multitude of de|bates, might too often be hurtful to the public good.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, it is never at the birth of a con&s;titution, and amid&s;t the great fermentations of liberty, that there is
<PB N="56" REF="017686_0054_0FA21D70F36C5268">
cau&s;e to fear that a body of repre&s;entatives &s;hould, either from weakne&s;s or corruption, betray the intere&s;ts with which they are entru&s;ted. It is rather in &s;uch a body that the general &s;pirit is both exalted and inflamed. In that re&s;ides, in its vigour, the genius of the nation. Cho&s;en by the e&s;teem of their fellow-citizens, cho&s;en at a time when every public function is a danger, and every vote an honour, placed at the head of tho&s;e who will compo&s;e for ever that celebrated Areopagus, and thence even na|turally carried to regard the public liberty as their own work, they cannot but have the enthu&s;ia&s;m of founders, who make it their pride to have their names engraved con|&s;picuou&s;ly, to be read by di&s;tant ages, on the fronti&s;piece of an augu&s;t monument which is ri&s;ing. The fears which the parti&s;ans of the contrary &s;y&s;tem might have upon this object, &s;eem, therefore, to have &s;mall foundation.</P>
<P>I will &s;ay more. It might happen that a people who are fighting for liberty, fatigued with a long and painful &s;truggle, and more &s;truck with the pre&s;ent danger than the future good, might feel their courage failing, and perhaps, one day, be tempted to prefer dependence and peace to independence and tumult, attended with peril and with blood. Then would it be advantageous to this people to have dive&s;ted them&s;elves of the power of making peace with their oppre&s;&s;ors, and depo&s;ited it in the hands of the &s;enate which they had cho&s;en to &s;erve as an organ to their will, when this will could &s;hew it&s;elf with freedom, pride, and courage. It &s;eems as it each individual, when he had given his voice for the in&s;tituting &s;uch a &s;enate, &s;hould &s;ay to it&punc; I rai&s;e the &s;tandard of war again&s;t my ty|rants. If my arm &s;hould weary in the war, if I could de|ba&s;e my&s;elf &s;o low as to implore repo&s;e, &s;upport me again&s;t my weakne&s;s. Li&s;ten to no prayer or wi&s;h unworthy of me, which I di&s;avow beforehand; and pronounce not the name of peace until my bonds be broken.</P>
<P>In reality, if we con&s;ult the hi&s;tory of republics, we &s;hall &s;ee, that the multitude have almo&s;t always great im|petuo&s;ity and heat at the fir&s;t moment; but that it is only in a &s;mall number of cho&s;en men, and qualified to &s;erve as chiefs, that re&s;ide tho&s;e con&s;tant and vigorous re&s;olu|tions

which march, with a &s;teady, firm, undaunted &s;tep, towards &s;ome great and worthy end, never turning, or looking, from the path, and never cea&s;ing mo&s;t &s;tubborn|ly to combat all ob&s;tructions that they meet with, from fortune, from mi&s;ery, and from man.</P>
<P>However it be, and what&s;oever &s;ide may be taken in this political di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, the Americans had not yet created for them&s;elves a &s;y&s;tem of government, when in the month of March, Hopkins plundered the i&s;land of Provi|dence of a large train of artillery and a con&s;iderable quan|tity of ammunition; when in the beginning of May, Carleton drove out of Canada the provincial troops, which were employed to reduce Quebec with a view of compleat|ing the conque&s;t of that important territory; when in the month of June, Clinton and Parker had been &s;o vigorou&s;ly repul&s;ed on the Southern coa&s;ts of America. Far greater &s;cenes followed the declaration of independence.</P>
<P>Howe had been appointed to &s;uper&s;ede the feeble Gage: and it was this new general who had evacuated Bo&s;ton. Having arrived on the 2d of April at Halifax, on the 10th of June he departed for Staten-I&s;land. The forces, which were to act both by &s;ea and land, &s;ucce&s;&s;ive|ly joined him according to expectation; and on the 28th of Augu&s;t he landed on Long-I&s;land without oppo&s;ition, under the protection of a fleet commanded by the admiral his brother. The Americans exhibited as little &s;pirit in defending the interior part of their country as they did on the landing of the enemy.</P>
<P>After a very feeble re&s;i&s;tance, and con&s;iderable lo&s;s, they took refuge on the continent with a facility which would hardly have been granted them by a conqueror who knew how to avail him&s;elf of the advantages he had ob|tained. The city of New-York too was abandoned by the&s;e new republicans with &s;till greater precipitation than they had evacuated Long I&s;land: and they filed off to|wards King&s;bridge, where they appeared determined to make an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>If the Engli&s;h had followed up their &s;ucce&s;s with that vivacity which circum&s;tances demanded, the new-rai&s;ed troops which had oppo&s;ed them, had infallibly been di&s;|per&s;ed,
<PB N="58" REF="017686_0056_0FA21D73DA7C78C8">
or reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of laying down their arms. On the contrary, they were allowed &s;ix week: to recover from their con&s;ternation: nor did they abandon their intrenchments till the night of the fir&s;t or &s;econd of November, when the movements, which were making in their view, were &s;ufficient to convince them that their camp was upon the point of being attacked.</P>
<P>Their commander in chief, Wa&s;hington, was unwil|ling to tru&s;t the fate of his country to an action, which might, and naturally would have terminated to the pre|judice of tho&s;e important intere&s;ts which had been com|mitted to him. He knew, that delays, ever favourable to a native, are ever fatal to a &s;tranger. This conviction determined him to retire to the Jer&s;eys with a de&s;ign of protracting the war. Favoured both by the inclemency of the &s;ea&s;on, by his knowledge of the country, and by the nature of the ground, which compen&s;ated in &s;ome mea&s;ure for the want of di&s;cipline, he had rea&s;on to flatter him&s;elf, that he &s;hould be able to cover the greate&s;t part of this fertile province, and keep the enemy at a di&s;tance from Penn&s;ylvania. In a moment, however, he &s;ees his colours abandoned by the &s;oldiers, who&s;e engagement, at the end of &s;ix, and even at the end of three months, had expired: and of an army of twenty five thou&s;and men, there &s;carce remained two thou&s;and five hundred, with which he was fortunate enough to retire beyond the De|laware.</P>
<P>Without lo&s;ing a moment, the King's troops ought to have pa&s;&s;ed the river in pur&s;uit of this handful of fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|tives, and have put them totally to the route. If the fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> thou&s;and men, de&s;tined for the conque&s;t of Rhode-I&s;land, had gone up the river in the tran&s;ports they were aboard of, the junction of the two corps might have been effected without oppo&s;ition even in Philadelphia it&s;elf, and the new republic had been &s;tifled in that important and cele|brated city which gave it birth.</P>
<P>At this time, perhaps, reproaches were ca&s;t on the Engli&s;h general for being timid and too circum&s;pect in the operations of the campaign. Certain it is, however, that he was ra&s;h enough in the di&s;tribution of his winter-can|tonments.
<PB N="59" REF="017686_0057_0FA21D7433461D28">
They were di&s;po&s;ed in &s;uch a manner, as if there remained not in America a &s;ingle individual, who had either inclination or power to mole&s;t them.</P>
<P>This pre&s;umption encouraged the militia of Penn&s;yl|vania, Maryland, and Virginia, collected together and re-united for the &s;upport of the common cau&s;e.</P>
<P>On the 25th of December they cro&s;&s;ed the Delaware, and fell accidentally upon Trenton, which was occupied by fifteen hundred of the twelve thou&s;and He&s;&s;ians, &s;old in &s;o ba&s;e a manner, by their avaricious ma&s;ter, to the king of Great-Britain. This corps was ma&s;&s;acred, taken, or entirely di&s;per&s;ed. Eight days after three Engli&s;h re|giments were in like manner driven from Princeton, but after having better &s;upported their reputation than the foreign troops in their pay.</P>
<P>The&s;e unexpected events reduced the enemies of Ame|rica, in the Jer&s;eys, to the nece&s;&s;ity of confining their po&s;ts to Amboy and Brun&s;wick, where yet they were exceed|ingly harra&s;&s;ed during the remainder of the winter.</P>
<P>The effect of &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, and of great dangers, is often to a&s;toni&s;h the mind, and to throw it into that kind of torpor that deprives it of the u&s;e of its powers; by de|grees it recovers and collects it&s;elf; all its faculties, &s;u&s;|pended for a moment, di&s;play them&s;elves with redoubled vigour: every &s;pring of action is awakened, and it feels its powers ri&s;e at once to a level with the difficulties it has to encounter. In a great multitude there are always &s;ome who feel this immediate effect, which rapidly communi|cates it&s;elf to others. Such a revolution took place a|mong&s;t the confederate &s;tates. It cau&s;ed armed men to i&s;&s;ue from all quarters.</P>
<P>It was very late before the campaign of 1777 was open|ed. The Engli&s;h army, in de&s;pair of penetrating into Penn&s;ylvania by way of the Jer&s;eys, at la&s;t embarked on the 23d of July, and, by the bay of Che&s;apeak, landed in a country which their generals may very ju&s;tly be re|proached for not having invaded the year before. Their march is uninterrupted, till they reach Brandywine. There, on the 11th of September, they attack and beat the Americans, and arrive on the 30th at Philadelphia,
<PB N="60" REF="017686_0058_0FA21D75D080EE08">
which had been abandoned on the 25th by the Congre&s;s, and a few days later or &s;ooner by the greate&s;t number of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>This victory is attended with no con&s;equences. The conqueror &s;ees nothing around him but hatred and de|va&s;tation. Pent up in a &s;pace extremely circum&s;cribed, he meets with in&s;urmountable ob&s;tacles in extending him|&s;elf over an uncultivated country. Even his gold affords him not its u&s;ual re&s;ources in the neighbouring di&s;tricts, nor is there a po&s;&s;ibility of any &s;upplies, but what mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily cro&s;s the &s;eas. The irk&s;omene&s;s of an impri|&s;onment of nine months duration, determined him to re|gain New York by way of the Jer&s;eys; and under the command of Clinton, &s;ucce&s;&s;or to Howe, this long and dangerous retreat was effected, without &s;u&s;taining &s;o much lo&s;s as a more experienced enemy would have occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P>While the Engli&s;h were wa&s;ting away their time in Penn&s;ylvania, an important &s;cene opens it&s;elf in the more northern part of America. In the month of May, 1776, Carleton had driven the provincials out of Canada, and in October de&s;troyed the armed &s;loops which they had con&s;tructed on the Lake Champlain. This &s;ucce&s;s drew Burgoyne to Ticonderoga, in the month of July in the following year. At his approach, a garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ting of four thou&s;and men, abandoned this important po&s;t, with the lo&s;s of their rear-guard, their artillery, and am|munition.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h general was naturally pre&s;umptuous. A weakne&s;s &s;o extraordinary increa&s;ed his arrogance. He had conceived the de&s;ign of re uniting the troops of Ca|nada with tho&s;e of New-York by Hud&s;on's-river. This project was bold and great. Had he &s;ucceeded he would have out North-America in two, and, perhaps, have end|ed the war. But, to have had &s;ucce&s;s, it would have been nece&s;&s;ary, that whil&s;t one army was going down, the other &s;hould have gone up, the river. Having failed in this idea. Burgoyne ought to have &s;een, from the very fir&s;t &s;teps of it, that his enterprize was chimerical. At every march it became more and more &s;o. His communication grew more di&s;tant; his provi&s;ions le&s;s abundant. The Ameri|cans,
<PB N="61" REF="017686_0059_0FA21D775C360FA8">
taking heart again, a&s;&s;embled from all parts round him. At length this unlucky body of men found them|&s;elves caught, on the 13th of October, at Saratoga; and nations learned with a&s;toni&s;hment, that &s;ix thou&s;and of the be&s;t di&s;ciplined troops of the old hemi&s;phere, had laid down their arms before the hu&s;bandmen of the new, con|ducted by the fortunate Gates. Tho&s;e who remembered that the Swedes, under Charles the twelfth, till then in|vincible, had capitulated before the Ruffians, yet uncivi|lized, did not accu&s;e the Engli&s;h troops, but only bla|med the imprudence of their general.</P>
<P>This event, &s;o deci&s;ive in the opinion of our politicians, was of no greater con&s;equence than that with which other actions, le&s;s favourable to the American arms, had been attended. After three years of fighting, ma&s;&s;acre, and deva&s;tacion, the &s;tate of things was &s;carcely changed from what it had been a fortnight after the commencement of ho&s;tilities. Let us endeavour to di&s;cover the cau&s;es of &s;o &s;trange a &s;ingularity.</P>
<P>Great-Britain, accu&s;tomed to &s;torms at home, &s;aw not at fir&s;t all the danger there might be in the tempe&s;t which was ri&s;ing in her remote po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. For a long time her troops had been in&s;ulted at Bo&s;ton; an authority, inde|pendent of her's, had been formed in the province of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. The other colonies were making di&s;po|&s;itions to follow this example, had not the admini&s;tration taken tho&s;e great objects into their &s;erious con&s;ideration. When th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> were laid before parliament, both hou&s;es were filled with clamour; and much declamation followed af|ter much declamation that had gone before. The &s;enate of the nation decreed at la&s;t, that the country which was rebellious to its decreed, &s;hould by force be made obedient: but his violent re&s;olution was executed with the &s;lowne&s;s too frequent in &s;tates of freedom.</P>
<P>England thought, in general, that coa&s;ts without de|fence, that countries entirely open, could not re&s;i&s;t her fleets and armies. It did not appear to her that this ex|pedition could be of &s;ufficient duration to give time to the peaceful hu&s;bandmen of America to learn the art of war. It was forgotten that the climate, the rivers, the de&s;ires,
<PB N="62" REF="017686_0060_0FA21D78026F9C88">
the &s;wamps, the want of provi&s;ion, in proportion as ad|vances were made into the country, and an infinity of o|ther natural ob&s;tructions, militating again&s;t a rapid pro|gre&s;s in a region three-fourths uncultivated, &s;hould have made a part of the calculation.</P>
<P>Succe&s;s was &s;till more retarded by the influence of mo|ral cau&s;es.</P>
<P>Great-Britain is the region of party. Her kings have generally &s;eemed to be well enough convinced of the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of leaving public affairs to the management of the prevailing faction, by which they were conducted com|monly with intelligence and with vigour, becau&s;e the principal agents of which it was compo&s;ed were animated by a common intere&s;t. Then, to public &s;pirit, which reigns more in England than in any other government of Europe, was added the power of a faction, and that &s;pirit of party which moves men's minds &s;o powerfully, becau&s;e it is always the effect of pa&s;&s;ion. To rid him&s;elf of this re&s;traint, George the third compo&s;ed his council of detached, unconnected members. This innovation was not attended with any very great inconveniencies, as long as events rolled round in their common cour&s;e. But as &s;oon as a war with America had complicated a ma|chine, which was not before too &s;imple, it was perceived that it had neither that &s;trength, nor that union, which are &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for the execution of great affairs. The wheels, too far a&s;under, wanted, as we may &s;ay, a cen|tre of motion, and a common impul&s;e. They went &s;lug|gi&s;hly and precipitately, by turns. The admini&s;tration too much re&s;embled that of an ordinary monarchy, when the principle of action proceeds not from the head of an intelligent and active monarch, who brings together all the &s;prings under his own hand. There was no longer any integrity or wholene&s;s in what was undertaken, nor was there more of it in what was executed.</P>
<P>A mini&s;try, without harmony and concord, was expo|&s;ed to the ince&s;&s;antly renewed attacks of a body of ene|mies, united, clo&s;e, and firm. Its re&s;olutions, be they what they would, were &s;ure to be combated by rea&s;oning or by ridicule. It was reproached for having been &s;evere
<PB N="63" REF="017686_0061_0FA21D7A8DC84260">
with the di&s;tant members of the &s;tate, as it would have been reproached for having been too tender to them. Even they who in parliament were the mo&s;t outrageous again&s;t the treatment which had been &s;hewn to the Ame|ricans; they who mo&s;t encouraged them to re&s;i&s;tance; they who, perhaps, &s;ecretly &s;ent them &s;uccour, were as aver&s;e to their independence as the very mini&s;ters whom they laboured, without cea&s;ing, to remove or vilify. Could the oppo&s;ition have &s;ucceeded in di&s;gu&s;ting the king with his confidents, or have obtained the &s;acrifice of them by the cry of the nation, the project of &s;ubjugating America had &s;till been followed, but with more dignity, more force, and perhaps with mea&s;ures better planned. As the reduction of the revolted provinces was not to be their work, they rather wi&s;hed that this immen&s;e part of the Briti&s;h empire might be &s;eparated from it, than that it &s;hould be re-united by any other hands than theirs.</P>
<P>The activity of the generals repaired not the vice of the&s;e contrarieties, and the delays in con&s;equence. They indulged the &s;oldier with too long repo&s;e; they employed in meditating, the time for acting; they approached new-rai&s;ed men with the precaution they would have taken before veteran troops. The Engli&s;h, who have &s;o much impetuo&s;ity in party, are of a cool and calm character in other things. They are to be agitated but by violent pa&s;|&s;ions. When this &s;pring is wanting, they move &s;low e|nough to count their &s;teps. Then they govern them&s;elves by the temper of their mind, which, in general, if we except the arts of imagination and ta&s;te, is, in every thing el&s;e, methodical and wi&s;e. In war, their valour never lo&s;es &s;ight of principles, or leaves much to chance. Rarely do they leave, either on their flanks, or in their rear, any thing which may give them trouble. This &s;y|&s;tem has its advantages, particularly in a clo&s;e and nar|row country, in a country &s;et thick with &s;trong holds and fortified towns. But in the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, and upon the va&s;t continent of America, again&s;t a people who &s;hould not have had time allowed them for their being fortified, or inured to war, the perfection of the art, per|haps, had been to have forgot it, and to &s;ub&s;titute, in its

&s;tead, the rapid and impetuous march, and the mighty da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ngs which at once a&s;toni&s;h, &s;trike, and overcome. It was in the fir&s;t moments, above all, that it would have been nece&s;&s;ary to impre&s;s upon the Americans, not the terror of &s;uch ravages as affect a people, armed for their liberty, more with indignation than with fear; but that dread which is &s;truck from a &s;uperiority of talents and of arms, and which a warlike people, of the old world, &s;hould naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed to carry to the new. The confidence of victory had &s;oon been victory it&s;elf. But by too much circum&s;pection, by their too &s;ervile attach|ment to rules and principles, &s;kilful leaders failed of ren|dering to their country the &s;ervice it expected from them, and which it was ju&s;tified in expecting.</P>
<P>The troops, on their &s;ide, did not pre&s;s their com|manders to lead them on. They were ju&s;t come from a country, where the cau&s;e which had &s;ent them acro&s;s the ocean, made no impre&s;&s;ion. It was, in the eyes of the people, but a broil which could not be of any con&s;e|quence. They confounded the debates it occa&s;ioned in parliament with other debates, often of &s;mall importance. It was not talked of; or if &s;ome per&s;ons entertained them&s;elves with it, they were not more earne&s;t about it than about tho&s;e pieces of news, which, in great cities, occupy the idlene&s;s of every day. The indifference of the nation had communicated it&s;elf to the defenders of its rights. They would even have been afraid, perhaps, to gain too deci&s;ive advantages over countrymen, who had taken arms but to keep them&s;elves from chains. In all the monarchies of Europe, the &s;oldier is but an in&s;tru|ment of de&s;poti&s;m, and has its di&s;po&s;ition. He looks up|on him&s;elf as belonging to the throne, and not to the country; and a hundred thou&s;and armed men, are but a hundred thou&s;and di&s;ciplined and formidable &s;laves. The habit even of exerci&s;ing the empire of force, that empire to which all gives way, contributes to extingui&s;h in them every &s;park o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the love of liberty. At length, the mili|tary government and &s;ubordination, which moves thou|&s;ands of arms by a &s;ingle voice, which permits no a&s;king, nor &s;eeing, nor judging, nor thinking; and, at the first

&s;ignal, makes it a law to kill or die, compleats the work of changing the&s;e &s;entiments into principles, which make what may be called the morals of their &s;tate. It is not &s;o in England. The influence of the con&s;titution is &s;o great, that it extends it&s;elf even to the troops. There, a man is a citizen before he is a &s;oldier. Public opinion, con|forming it&s;elf to the con&s;titution, honours one, and light|ly regards the other, of the&s;e titles. That we &s;ee by the hi&s;tory of the revolutions and tempe&s;ts by which that tur|bulent i&s;land has been torn, that the Engli&s;h &s;oldier, though enli&s;ted for life, pre&s;erves for political liberty a pa&s;&s;ion, of which an idea is not ea&s;ily to be formed in our countries of &s;laves.</P>
<P>How &s;hould the ardour which was wanting in the Bri|ti&s;h troops have animated the He&s;&s;ians, the Brun&s;wickers, and the other Germans ranking under the &s;ame banners, all equally di&s;contented with the princes who had &s;old them, di&s;contented with the &s;overeign who had bought them, di&s;contented with the nation which paid their wa|ges, and di&s;contented with their comrades, who treated their mercenarine&s;s with contempt? Be&s;ides, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d al&s;o brothers in the enemy's camp, to whom they dreaded to give death, and from who&s;e hand a wound would have grieved them with a double pain.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit of the Engli&s;h army had been altered too, in con&s;equence of a revolution in the manners of their country, which had taken place about fifteen or eighteen years before. The &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the la&s;t war; the exten&s;ion which the peace had given to commerce; the great ac|qui&s;itions made in the Ea&s;t Indies: all the&s;e means of fortune had, without interruption, accumulated in Great-Britain prodigious riches. The&s;e riches kindled the de|&s;ire of new enjoyments. The great went to acquire them in foreign countries; and, above all, in France; and brought home the poi&s;on to their country. From the higher conditions, it flowed down into all the cla&s;&s;es, even to the lowe&s;t. To a character of plainne&s;s, &s;implicity, re|&s;erve, and haughtine&s;s, &s;ucceeded a ta&s;te for exterior &s;hew, for di&s;&s;ipation, gallantry, and what is called politene&s;s. Travellers who had formerly vi&s;ited this i&s;land &s;o renown|ed,
<PB N="66" REF="017686_0064_0FA21D7D127C0E40">
thought them&s;elves in another climate. The conta|gion had &s;pread to the troops. They carried with them to the new hemi&s;phere the pa&s;&s;ion which they had con|tracted in the old, for gaming, for &s;oft accommodation, and good living. In departing from their coa&s;t, they &s;hould have renounced the &s;uperfluities of which they were enamoured. This ta&s;te for luxury, this ardour, &s;o much the more violent as it was new, did not encourage them to pur&s;ue, into the interior part of the country, an enemy ever ready to plunge into it for &s;helter. Ye new politi|cians, who advance with &s;o much confidence, that man|ners have no influence on the fate of nations; that, with regard to them, the mea&s;ure of greatne&s;s is that of riches; that the plea&s;ures of peace and the voluptuou&s;ne&s;s of the citizen cannot weaken the effect of tho&s;e great machines called armies, and of which the European di&s;cipline has, according to your account, &s;o perfected the infallible and tremendous operations: you, who to &s;upport your opi|nion, mu&s;t turn away your eyes from the a&s;hes of Carthage and the ruins of Rome, upon the recital I am making to you; &s;u&s;pend your judgment, and believe it po&s;&s;ible that there may be opportunities of &s;ucce&s;s which are lo&s;t by luxury. Believe, that, even to courageous troops, inde|pendence on wants has been often the chief cau&s;e of con|que&s;t. It is too ea&s;y perhaps to brave only death. For nations corrupted by opulence, a &s;everer trial is re&s;erved, that of &s;upporting the lo&s;s of their plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Add to all the&s;e rea&s;ons, that the means of war &s;eldom arrived, acro&s;s &s;uch a length of &s;ea, in the convenient &s;ea&s;on for action. Add, that the councils of George the third were wi&s;ely determined to have too much influence in military operations which were to be executed at &s;uch a di&s;tance from them; and you will know the greate&s;t part of the ob&s;tacles by which the ruinous efforts of the mo|ther country again&s;t the freedom of her colonies were op|po&s;ed.</P>
<P>But how happened it that America did not her&s;elf re|pul&s;e from her &s;hores the&s;e Europeans who were bringing to her chains or death?</P>
<P>This new world was de&s;ended by regular troops, which

at fir&s;t had been enli&s;ted but for three or &s;ix months, and afterwards for three years, or as long as ho&s;tilities might continue. It was defended by citizens who took the field only when their particular province was invaded or me|naced. Neither this army always on foot, nor this mili|tia ca&s;ually a&s;&s;embled, had a military turn. They were farmers, traders, lawyers, exerci&s;ed only in the arts of peace, and conducted to danger by guides, as little ver&s;ed as their &s;ubalterns in the very complicated &s;cience of war. In this &s;tate of things, what hope could they have of mea|&s;uring them&s;elves with advantage again&s;t veterans in di&s;|cipline, formed to evolution, in&s;tructed in tactics, and abundantly provided with all the in&s;truments nece&s;&s;ary to a vigorous attack, to an ob&s;tinate defence?</P>
<P>Enthu&s;ia&s;m alone might have &s;urmounted the&s;e difficul|ties: but did there in reality exi&s;t more enthu&s;ia&s;m in the colonies than in the mother-country?</P>
<P>The general opinion in England, was, that the parlia|ment had e&s;&s;entially the right of taxing every country which made a part of the Briti&s;h empire. Perhaps, in the beginning of the troubles, not a hundred individuals were to be found who would have called this authority in que&s;tion. Yet no anger was excited by the refu&s;al of the Americans to acknowledge it. No hatred was borne to|wards them even after they had taken arms in &s;upport of their preten&s;ions. As the labours of the people in the interior part of the kingdom were not affected by it, as the &s;torm murmured but at a di&s;tance, every one was peaceably occupied with his bu&s;ine&s;s, or gave him&s;elf up without di&s;turbance to his plea&s;ures. They all waited for the conclu&s;ion of the drama without impatience, as if al|ready certain of what was to be exhibited in the unravel|ling of the plot.</P>
<P>The ferment mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;hewn it&s;elf at fir&s;t much greater in the new hemi&s;phere than the old. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ever the co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s name of tyranny, or the grateful &s;ound of independence, pronounced to nations without commu|nicating to them that warmth which produces motion? But did that warmth &s;u&s;tain it&s;elf? Had the fir&s;t vehe|mence of imagination la&s;ted, mu&s;t not the repre&s;&s;ing of
<PB N="68" REF="017686_0066_0FA21D7DF950BAC0">
exce&s;&s;es have occupied the attention of the new authority? But &s;o far from having cau&s;e to withhold courage, it had cowardice to pur&s;ue. It was &s;een to puni&s;h de&s;ertion with death, &s;taining the &s;tandard of liberty with blood. It was &s;een to refu&s;e admitting of an exchange of pri&s;oners, for fear of augmenting the inclination of the troops to &s;ur|render at the fir&s;t &s;ummons. It was &s;een reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of erecting tribunals for the pro&s;ecution of the generals or their lieutenants who &s;hould too ea&s;ily give up the po&s;ts which their vigilance was to guard. It is true, that a hoary patriot, of four&s;core years, who was de&s;ired to return to his fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;ide, cried out, <HI>My death will be of u&s;e; I &s;hall &s;hield with my body a younger man.</HI> It is true, that Putnam &s;aid to a royali&s;t his pri&s;oner, <HI>Return to thy com|mands, and if be a&s;ks thee how many troops I have, tell him, that I have enough; that, even if he &s;hould beat them, I &s;hould have &s;till enough; and that he will find, in the event, that I have too many for him and for the tyrants whom he &s;erves.</HI> The&s;e &s;entiments were heroic, but they were rare; and they became le&s;s common every day.</P>
<P>The intoxication was never general; and it could be but momentateous. None of tho&s;e energetic cau&s;es, which have produced &s;o many revolutions upon the globe, exi&s;t|ed in North-America. Neither religion nor lawe had there been outraged. The blood of martyrs or patriots had not there &s;treamed from &s;caffolds. Morals had not been there in&s;ulted. Manners, cu&s;toms, habits, no ob|ject dear to nations had there been the &s;port of ridicule. Arbitrary power had not there torn any inhabitant from the arms of his family and his friends, to drag him to a dreary dungeon. Public order had not been there invert|ed. The principles of admini&s;tration had not been chang|ed there; and the maxims of government had there al|ways remained the &s;ame. The whole que&s;tion was re|duced to the knowing whether the mother country had, or had not, the right to lay, directly, or indirectly, a flight tax upon the colonies: for the accumulated griev|ances in the manife&s;to were valid only in con&s;equence of this leading grievance. This, almo&s;t metaphy&s;ical, que|&s;tion, was &s;carcely of &s;ufficient importance to cau&s;e the

multitude to ri&s;e, or at lea&s;t to intere&s;t them &s;trongly in a quarrel for which they &s;aw their land deprived of the hands de&s;tined to its cultivation, their harve&s;ts laid wa&s;te, their fields covered with the dead bodies of their kindred, or &s;tained with their own blood. To the&s;e calamities, the work of the royal troops upon the coa&s;t, were &s;oon added more in&s;upportable ones in the heart of the country.</P>
<P>Never had the re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s of the courts of London and Ver&s;ailles di&s;turbed the tranquillity of North America but both the&s;e powers brought &s;ome of the migratory clans in this part of the new hemi&s;phere to partake in their &s;an|guinary &s;trife. In&s;tructed by experience in the weight which the&s;e bordes could add to the &s;cale, the Engli&s;h and the coloni&s;ts were equally re&s;olved to employ them for their mutual de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Carleton tried, fir&s;t, to arm the&s;e barbarous bands in Canada. "It is the di&s;pute," &s;aid they in an&s;wer to his &s;olicitations, "of a father with his children; we do not think it right for us to enter into this dome&s;tic &s;quabble." &mdash;"But if the rebels &s;hould come to attack this province, would not you help us to drive them back?"&mdash;"Ever &s;ince the peace, the hatchet of war has been buried forty fathoms deep."&mdash;"You would certainly find it, if you were to dig for it."&mdash;"The helve of it is rotten, and we cannot make any u&s;e of it."</P>
<P>The United States were not more fortunate. "We have heard talk of &s;ome differences that have happened between Old and New England (&s;aid the tribe of the O|neidas to their deputies) but we &s;hall never take a part in &s;uch atrocious divi&s;ions. War between brethren is a new and a &s;trange thing in the&s;e regions. Our traditions have left us no example of this nature. Suppre&s;s your mad ha|tred; and may a benevolent &s;un di&s;per&s;e the black vapour in which you are involved!"</P>
<P>The Ma&s;phies alone &s;eemed to intere&s;t them&s;elves in the cau&s;e of the Americans. "There (&s;aid the&s;e good &s;avages to them) there's &s;ixteen &s;hillings for you. 'Tis all that we have. We thought to have bought &s;ome rum with it; we'll drink water. We'll go a hunting. If any bea&s;ts fall by our arrows, we'll &s;ell their &s;kins, and bring you the money."</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="017686_0068_0FA21D7F79EF6FA8">But in time, the very active agents of Great Britain &s;ucceeded in conciliating to it many nations of the&s;e abo|rigines. Its intere&s;ts were preferred to tho&s;e of its ene|mies, as well becau&s;e the remoter di&s;tance had prevented the &s;avages from having received &s;o many outrages from it as from their proud neighbours, as becau&s;e it could and would better pay the &s;ervices which might be rendered to its cau&s;e.

<P>The&s;e calamities attacked but a more or le&s;s con&s;idera|ble number of the members of the United States, who &s;oon after were all, collectively, afflicted by an inward hurt.</P>
<P>The metals, which, throughout the whole globe, re|pre&s;ent all the object of commerce, had, in this part of the new world, never been abundant. The &s;mall quan|tity of them which had been &s;een there, di&s;appeared even at the commencement of ho&s;tilities. To the&s;e &s;igns, uni|ver&s;ally agreed upon, were &s;ub&s;tituted &s;igns peculiar to the&s;e provinces. Paper replaced &s;ilver and gold.

The artifice did not &s;uc|ceed. The&s;e ideal riches were rejected. The more the multiplication of them was urged by want, the greater did their depreciation grow. The Congre&s;s was indig|nant at the affronts given to its money, and declared all tho&s;e to be traitors to their country who &s;hould not receive it as they would have received gold it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Did not this body know, that prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions are no more to be controled than feelings are?

Could it pretend that it did not puni&s;h a want of confidence with the pains which would have been &s;carcely merited by revolt and trea&s;on? Of all this was the Congre&s;s well aware. But it had no choice of means. Its de&s;pi&s;ed and de&s;picable &s;craps of paper were actually thirty times below their original va|lue, when more of them were ordered to be made. On the 13<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h of September, 1779, there was of this paper mo|ney, among&s;t the public, to the amount of &pound; 35, 544.155.

<P>The people had no amends for this dome&s;tic &s;courge, as it might be called, by an ea&s;y communication with all the other parts of the world. Great-Britain had inter|cepted their navigation with Europe, with the We&s;t-In|dies, with all the latitudes which their ve&s;&s;els covered. Then, they &s;aid to the univer&s;e, "It is the Engli&s;h name which makes us od<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">us; we &s;olemnly abjure it.

An invitation, &s;o &s;edu|cing in appearance, was not complied with. Tho&s;e &s;tates which are truly commercial ones, knowing that North-America had been reduced to contract debts at the e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> even of her greate&s;t pro&s;perity, thought wi&s;ely that in her pre&s;ent d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tre&s;s &s;he would be able to pay but very little for what might be carried to her. The French alone, who dare every thing, dared to brave the incon|veniencies of this new connection.

<P>A multitude of privateers, added to &s;o many other mis|fortunes, might make the Americans regret their former

tranquillity, and incline them to an accommodation with England. In vain had the people been bound to the new government by the &s;acredne&s;s of oaths and the influ|ence of religion. In vain had endeavours been u&s;ed to convince them that it was impo&s;&s;ible to treat &s;afely with a country in which one parliament might overturn what &s;hould have been e&s;tabli&s;hed by another. In vain had they been threatened with the eternal re&s;entment of an exa&s;perated and vindictive enemy. It was po&s;&s;ible that the&s;e di&s;tant troubles might not be balanced by the weight of pre&s;ent evils.</P>
<P>So thought the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, when they &s;ent to the new world public agents, authori&s;ed to offer every thing except independence to the&s;e very Americans, from whom they had two years before exacted an unconditional &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion. It is not improbable but that by this plan of conciliation, a few months &s;ooner, &s;ome effect might have been produced. But at the period at which it was pro|po&s;ed by the court of London, it was rejected with di&s;|dain, becau&s;e this mea&s;ure appeared but as an argument of fear and weakne&s;s. The people were already re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;&s;ured. The Congre&s;s, the generals, the troops, the bold and &s;kil|ful men who in each colony had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of the authority; every thing had recovered its fir&s;t &s;pirit. This was the effect of a treaty of friend&s;hip and commerce between the United States and the court of Ver&s;ailles, &s;igned the 6th of February, 1778.</P>
<P>If the Briti&s;h mini&s;try had reflected upon it, they would have comprehended that the &s;ame delirium which was drawing them to attack their colonies, was reducing them to the nece&s;&s;ity of declaring war in the &s;ame in&s;tant again&s;t France. Then prevailed in the councils of this crown the circum&s;pection which mu&s;t always be in&s;pired by a new reign. Then the finances were &s;till in the confu&s;ion into which they had been plunged by a madne&s;s of twen|ty years. Then the decayed condition of the navy was &s;uch as filled every citizen with di&s;quiet. Then Spain, already fatigued with her extravagant expedition of Al|giers, found her&s;elf in embarra&s;&s;ments which would not have permitted her to run to the &s;uccour of her ally. And
<PB N="73" REF="017686_0071_0FA21D81C8077B20">
then might England, without ra&s;hne&s;s, have promi&s;ed her&s;elf &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t the mo&s;t powerful of her enemies, and to intimidate America by victories gained or conque&s;ts made near home. The importance that it was of, for this crown to take away from its rebellious &s;ubjects the only &s;upport of which they might be a&s;&s;ured, would have dimini&s;hed the indignation in&s;pired by a violation of the mo&s;t &s;olemn treaties.</P>
<P>George the third &s;aw nothing of all this. The ob|&s;cure &s;uccours which the court of Ver&s;ailles &s;ent to the provinces armed for the defence of their rights, did not open his eyes. The dock-yards of France were fil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing with &s;hipwrights. Her ar&s;enals were filling with artillery. Scarcely was there room remaining in her magazines for more naval &s;tores. Her ports pre&s;ented the mo&s;t mena|cing appearance; and this &s;trange blindne&s;s &s;till conti|nued. To awaken the court of St. James's from its le|thargy, it was nece&s;&s;ary that Lewis the &s;ixteenth &s;hould &s;ignify to i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, on the 14th of March, that he had acknow|ledged the independence of the United States.</P>
<P>This &s;ignification was a declaration of war. It was impo&s;&s;ible that a nation, more accu&s;tomed to give provo|cation than receive it, could patiently look on, whil&s;t ano|ther nation was loo&s;ening its &s;ubjects from their bonds of allegiance, and rai&s;ing them up with much parade to the rank of &s;overeign powers. All Europe fore&s;aw that two &s;tates, in rival&s;hip for ages, were about to tinge the wa|ters of the ocean with their blood, and again play that dreadful game, in which public pro&s;perities will never compen&s;ate for particular di&s;a&s;ters. They in whom am|bition had not extingui&s;hed all benevolence for their fel|low-creatures, deplored beforehand the calamities, which, in either hemi&s;phere, were ready to fall upon the human race.</P>
<P>The bloody &s;cene, notwith&s;tanding, did not open yet; and this delay gave credulity a ground of hope, that peace would &s;till continue. It was not known that a fleet, which had &s;ailed from Tou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on, was commi&s;&s;ioned to at|tack the Engli&s;h in North America.

<P>Here our ta&s;k becomes more and more difficult. Our &s;ole object is to be u&s;eful, and to be true. Far be from us that &s;pirit of party which blinds and degrades tho&s;e who are the conductors, and tho&s;e who a&s;pire to be the in&s;tructors, of mankind. Our wi&s;h is for our country; our homage is to ju&s;tice. We honour virtue, in whatever place, in whatever form, &s;he is &s;een: the di&s;tinctions of condition and of nation cannot e&s;trange us from her; and the man who is ju&s;t and magnanimous is our country|man over all the world. If in the different events which pa&s;s under our eyes, we blame with boldne&s;s what appears to us blame worthy, we &s;eek not the vain and &s;orry plea|&s;ure of ca&s;ting indi&s;creet reproach. But we are &s;peaking to nations and to po&s;terity. We ought to give them the hi&s;tory of errors, to teach them how they may be &s;hun|ed. Should we dare to be traitorou&s;ly wanting to &s;o great a duty, we might, perhaps, flatter the generation which pa&s;&s;eth away; but truth and ju&s;tice, which are eternal, would impeach us to future generations, who would read us with contempt, and pronounce not our name but with di&s;dain. In this long career we &s;hould be ju&s;t to tho&s;e who &s;till exi&s;t, as we have been to tho&s;e who exi&s;t no more. If, among&s;t the men of power, there are any who are offended at this freedom, let us not fear to tell them, that we are but the organ of a &s;upreme tribunal, which rea&s;on is erecting upon a ba&s;is that cannot be &s;haken. There is no longer a government in Europe but &s;hould &s;tand in fear of its determinations. Public opinion, which is becoming more and more informed, and which nothing has power to arre&s;t or awe, has its eyes open upon nations and their courts. It penetrates into the cabinets where policy would he hid. There it judges the de|po&s;itaries of power, their weakne&s;&s;es and their pa&s;&s;ions;
<PB N="75" REF="017686_0073_0FA21D8336E62748">
and, by the empire of genius and knowledge, rai&s;es it|&s;elf, on all &s;ides, above the mini&s;ters of kings, to incite or to re&s;train them. Wo to them who de&s;pi&s;e or brave it! This &s;eeming courage is weakne&s;s in reality. Wo to them who&s;e talents cannot arm them with a confidence to &s;u&s;tain its look! Let &s;uch, that they may once do ju&s;tice, at lea&s;t to them&s;elves, lay down the burden too heavy for their feeble &s;houlders. They will cea&s;e to expo&s;e them&s;elves and the nations they pretend to &s;erve.</P>
<P>France began the war with invaluable advantages. The time, the place, the circum&s;tances; &s;he had cho&s;en all. It was not till after &s;he had, at lei&s;ure, made her preparations, till after &s;he had increa&s;ed her power to the proper pitch, that &s;he &s;hewed her&s;elf upon the field of battle. She had to combat but an enemy who was humbled, weakened, and di&s;couraged by dome&s;tic feuds. The wi&s;hes of other nations were with her, again&s;t tho&s;e imperious ma&s;ters, or, as they were called, tho&s;e tyrants of the ocean.</P>
<P>Events &s;eemed to corre&s;pond to the de&s;ire of Europe. The French officers, who had old humiliations to wipe away, performed brilliant actions, the remembrance of which will be of long duration. Great theoretic know|ledge, and un&s;haken courage, &s;upplied what might be wanting in them from practice and experience. All the &s;ingle engagements, of &s;hip to &s;hip, did them the highe&s;t honour, and mo&s;t of them terminated to their advantage. The Briti&s;h fleet ran &s;till greater danger than the i&s;olated ve&s;&s;els. It was &s;o roughly treated as to have cau&s;e to fear being wholly or partially de&s;troyed; had not the French fleet, by which it was reduced, off U&s;hant, to this almo&s;t de&s;pairing &s;tate, been de&s;tined, from timid orders, from odious intrigues, from the weakne&s;s of its admirals, or from all the&s;e motives together, to quit the &s;ea and be the fir&s;t to make for port.</P>
<P>In the intoxication of this, perhaps, unexpected &s;ucce&s;s, France &s;eemed to lo&s;e &s;ight of her deare&s;t intere&s;ts. Her principal object &s;hould have been to intercept the com|merce of her enemies, cutting the double nerve of their &s;trength, their &s;eamen and their wealth, and &s;o &s;ap, at

once, the two foundations of Engli&s;h greatne&s;s. Nothing was more ea&s;y for a power prepared a long while for ho&s;tilities, than to intercept fleets of merchantmen, quite unprepared, and very feebly convoyed. This was not done. The immen&s;e riches expected by Great Britain, from all parts of the globe, entered peaceably into her harbours, without &s;uffering the &s;malle&s;t diminution.</P>
<P>The commerce of France, on the contrary, was hara&s;&s;|ed in both the hemi&s;pheres, and every where intercepted. Her colonies &s;aw ravi&s;hed from them, on their very coa&s;ts, &s;ub&s;i&s;tences, to welcome which they were reaching out their arms with all the eagerne&s;s of want; whil&s;t the mo|ther country was deprived of four millions &s;terling, arri|ved almo&s;t in her fight. This rever&s;e was not without a cau&s;e. Let us endeavour to di&s;cover it.</P>
<P>The French navy had been a long time un&s;ucce&s;sful; and it was to the vice of its con&s;titution that &s;o many mis|fortunes had been a&s;cribed. Many attempts had been made to modify or change the regulations of it; but the&s;e innovations, good or bad, were always repelled with a more or le&s;s &s;trongly marked di&s;dain. At length its ad|mirals dictated them&s;elves, in 1776, a di&s;po&s;ition, which rendering them ab&s;olute ma&s;ters of the roads and anchor|ing places, of the ar&s;enals, of the dock-wards, and the magazines, de&s;troyed that mutual in&s;pector&s;hip, which Lewis the fourteenth thought it was right he &s;hould e&s;ta|bli&s;h, between the military officers and tho&s;e of the admi|ni&s;tration. From that time there was no longer any re|&s;pon&s;ibility, regulation, or oeconomy; in the ports. Eve|ry thing there fell into di&s;order and confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The new plan had an influence that was &s;till more un|happy. Till this period, it was the mini&s;try who had directed the naval operations towards the end aimed at by their politics. This authority pa&s;&s;ed, perhaps, almo&s;t without being perceived, to tho&s;e who were to execute the&s;e operations, which took in&s;en&s;ibly a tincture from their prejudices. The&s;e prejudices inclined them to think, that it was not in heavily and laboriou&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; convoying the &s;hips of their nation, or in remaining out upon difficult crui&s;es, to &s;urpri&s;e or de&s;troy tho&s;e of the enemy's nation,

that fame was to be acquired. This double duty, there|fore, was entirely neglected, or very ill performed, in con&s;equence of the opinion common at Bre&s;t, that &s;uch a &s;ervice had nothing noble in it, and led not to any kind of glory.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that this prejudice is a very odd one, and qui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e contrary to all the laws of &s;ociety. What can be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the de&s;ign of &s;tates in in&s;ti|tuting this military force de&s;tined to &s;cour the &s;eas? Was it only to procure promotions for tho&s;e who command or &s;erve? Only to give them opportunities of exerci&s;ing a valour u&s;ele&s;s to every body but them&s;elves? Only to &s;tain red another element with bloody battles? No, un|doubtedly. Fleets of war upon the ocean, are what for|tre&s;&s;es and ramparts are for inhabitants of cities; what the national armies are for provinces expo&s;ed to incur&s;ions of the foe. There are &s;ome &s;orts of property attached to the &s;oil; there are others which are created, tran&s;ported by commerce, and, as they may be called, wandering on the ocean. Both the&s;e &s;orts of property want defenders. Warriors, that is your function. What would be &s;aid, if the land forces &s;hould refu&s;e to protect the inhabitants of cities, the cultivators of fields, and to drive back the fire threatened to the harve&s;t? Naval officers, you think your&s;elves deba&s;ed by convoying and protecting com|merce. But if commerce is to be no more protected, what will become of the riches of the &s;tate, of which, without doubt, you expect a part, in recompence of your &s;ervice? What will become of your own property, in the revenue of your land, which commerce and the circulation of wealth chiefly contribute to make fruitful? You think your&s;elves deba&s;ed.

<P>The max<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ms &s;acred at Port&s;mouth were very different. There was felt, there was re&s;pected, the dignity of com|merce. There, it was both a duty and an honour to de|fend it; and events have decided on which &s;ide the na|val officers had the ju&s;te&s;t ideas of their function.</P>
<P>Great-Britain had ju&s;t experienced a very humiliating rever&s;e in the new world, and a more powerful enemy threatened her with greater di&s;a&s;ters in the old. This alarming &s;ituation filled all minds with doubtfulne&s;s and di&s;tru&s;t. The national riches arrive. Tho&s;e of the rival power add to the enormous ma&s;s; and in&s;tantly public credit is reanimated; hope &s;orings up again, and this people, who were contemptuou&s;ly thought to be brought down, re&s;ume, and &s;u&s;tain, their u&s;ual prowe&s;s and their u&s;ual pride.</P>

<P>But let us &s;uppo&s;e that the hou&s;e of Bourbon have the advantages with which it may have been flattered. What ought to be its conduct?</P>
<P>France is in all points of view the empire the mo&s;t &s;trongly con&s;tituted, of which any remembrance has been pre&s;erved in the annals of the world. Without being able to bear any compari&s;on with her, Spain is likewi&s;e a ve|ry powerful &s;tate, and her means of pro&s;perity are conti|nually increa&s;ing. The mo&s;t important concern then of the hou&s;e of Bourbon ought to be, to obtain pardon of its neighbours for the advantages which it has from nature, which it owes to art, or which have been be&s;towed on it by events. Should it endeavour to augment its &s;uperiori|ty, the alarm would become general, and it would be thought that an univer&s;al &s;lavery was threatened. It is perhaps to be wondered at, that the other nations of Eu|rope have not yet thwarted it in its projects again&s;t Eng|land. The re&s;entment which the inju&s;tice and the haugh|tine&s;s of this proud i&s;land have every where in&s;pired, mu&s;t be the cau&s;e of this inaction. But hatred is &s;ilent when intere&s;t appears. It is po&s;&s;ible that Europe may think the weakening of Great Britain in the old and the new hemi&s;phere contrary to its &s;afety; and that, after having enjoyed the humiliations and dangers of this lofty and tyrannie power, &s;he may at length take arms in its defence. Should it be &s;o, the courts of Ver&s;ailles and Madrid would &s;ee them&s;elves fallen from the hope which they have conceived of a deci&s;ive prepondence upon the globe. The&s;e con&s;iderations &s;hould determine them to ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ten their attacks, and not give time, for the forming of new di&s;po&s;itions, to a prophetic or even a jealous poli|cy.

<P><PB N="88" REF="017686_0086_0FA21D925465AE00">The United States have &s;hewn openly the project of drawing all North America to their league. Many mea|&s;ures, that in particular of inviting the people of Canada to rebellion, have given cau&s;e to believe that this was likewi&s;e the wi&s;h of France. Spain may be &s;u&s;pected to have equally adopted this idea.</P>
<P>The conduct of the provices which have &s;haken off the yoke of Great-Britain is &s;imple, and &s;uch as was to be expected. But would not their allies be wanting is fore&s;ight, if they &s;hould have really the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem?</P>

<P>But would it be right for Spain and France, who&s;e po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions in the new world are an inexhau&s;tible &s;ource of riches; would it be right for them to precipitate this rup|ture?

The new people would

have compleated their preparations for inva&s;ion before the report of it had reached our climates. They would chu&s;e their enemy, the field and the moment of their vic|tories. Their thunder would fall always upon &s;eas with|out defence, or on coa&s;ts taken at unawares. In a little while the &s;outhern provinces would become their prey, and &s;upply by the riches of their productions the medi|ocrity of tho&s;e of the northern. Perhaps the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of our ab&s;olute monarchies might even be candidates for the honour of being admitted to a confederacy with a free people, or would detach them&s;elves from Europe in order to belong but to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The part which the courts of Madrid and Ver&s;ailles &s;hould take, if they are free to chu&s;e, is to let two powers &s;ub&s;i&s;t in North America&punc; who may watch, re&s;train, and counterpoize each other.

<P>In all probability, indeed, it is the very order of things which would be mo&s;t &s;uitable even for the confederate provinces them&s;elves. Their re&s;pective limits are not regulated. A great jealou&s;y &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the countries to the northward and tho&s;e to the &s;outhward. Political principles vary from one river to another. Great animo|&s;ities are ob&s;erved between the inhabitants of the &s;ame town, between the members of the &s;ame family. Each would throw off from him&s;elf the heavy burden of public expences and debts. A thou&s;and principles of divi&s;ion are generally &s;pringing in the bo&s;om of the United States. When dangers are once at an end, how is the explo&s;ion of &s;o many di&s;contents to be retarded? how are &s;o many un&s;ettled minds, and angered hearts, to be held attach|ed to a common centre? Let the true friends of Ameri|ca reflect upon it, and they will find that the only means to prevent di&s;turbances, among&s;t that people, is to leave remaining on their frontiers a powerful rival, always di&s;|po&s;ed to profit by their di&s;&s;entions.</P>

<P>Here, in order to form a &s;ound judgment, let us im|mediately begin with laying a&s;ide the intere&s;t which all hearts, not excepting tho&s;e of &s;laves, have taken in the generous efforts of a people, who expo&s;ed them&s;elves to the mo&s;t dreadful calamities to be free. The name of li|berty is &s;o &s;weet, that all they who fight for it are &s;ure to intere&s;t our &s;ecret wi&s;hes. Their cau&s;e is that of the whole human race; it becomes our own. We revenge our&s;elves of our own oppre&s;&s;ors, by giving vent, at lea&s;t, with liberty, to our hatred again&s;t tho&s;e oppre&s;&s;ors who cannot puni&s;h it. At the &s;ound of breaking chains, it &s;eems as if our own were about to become lighter; and we think for &s;ome moments that we breathe a purer air, in learning that fewer tyrants are to be counted in the world. The&s;e great revolutions of liberty, moreover, admoni&s;h de&s;pots. They warn them not to tru&s;t to too long patience in the people, not to tru&s;t to impunity with|out end. Thus, when the laws of &s;ociety execute ven|geance upon the crimes of private individuals, the good man hopes that the puni&s;hment of the guilty will, by its terrible example, prevent the commi&s;&s;ion of new crimes. Terror &s;ometimes &s;upplies the place of ju&s;tice to the thief, and con&s;cience to the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. Such is the &s;ource of the warm intere&s;t we feel in all the wars of liberty. Such is that with which we have been in&s;pired for the Americans. Our imaginations have been inflamed in their favour.

<P>In this region the lands are, almo&s;t throughout, bad, or of a middling quality. Scarcely any thing but maze grows in the four mo&s;t northern colonies.

<P>Corn &s;u&s;tains principally the provinces of New-York, Jer&s;ey, and Penn&s;ylvania. But the &s;oil there is &s;o rapid|ly become wor&s;e than it was, that an acre, which former|ly yielded full &s;ixty bu&s;hels of wheat, now produces but very rarely above twenty.</P>

<P>The Engli&s;h government, &s;eeing that North America could never enrich them by the productions proper to that country, thought of the powerful motive of premi|ums, for the creating, in this part of the new world, of linen, wine, and &s;ilk. The poverty of the &s;oil, which would not bear flax, ob&s;tructed the fir&s;t of the&s;e views; the badne&s;s of the climate, which would not agree with vines, oppo&s;ed the &s;ucce&s;s of the &s;econd: and the want of hands permitted not the third to take place.

<P>We cannot determine, without ra&s;hne&s;s, what may one day be the population of the United States. Such a cal|culation, generally pretty difficult, becomes impracticable for a region where the land degenerates very rapidly, and where the expence of labour and improvement is not pro|portionably an&s;wered by the reproduction. If ten millions of men ever find a certain &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in the&s;e provinces, it will be much. Even then the exportation will be re|duced to nothing, or next to nothing: but interior in|du&s;try will replace foreign indu&s;try. The country, with|in a little, will be able to &s;uffice for it&s;elf, provided that the inhabitants know how to make them&s;elves happy by oeconomy and with mediocrity.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="017686_0092_0FA21D9843637A38">Ye people of North-America, let the example of all the nations who have gone before you, and above all that of your mother-country, &s;erve you for in&s;truction. Fear the affluence of gold, which brings with luxury the cor|ruption of manners, the contempt of laws. Fear a too unequal di&s;tribution of riches, which exhibits a &s;mall number of citizens in opulence, and a great multitude of citizens in extreme poverty; whence &s;prings the in&s;olence of the former, and the deba&s;ement of the latter. Secure your&s;elves again&s;t the &s;pirit of conque&s;t. The tranquility of an empire dimini&s;hes in proportion to its exten&s;ion. Have arms for your defence; have none for offence. Seek competency and health, in labour; pro&s;perity, in the cul|ture of lands, and the work&s;hops of indu&s;try; power, in manners and virtue. Cau&s;e arts and &s;ciences, which di|&s;tingui&s;h the civilized from the &s;avage man, to flouri&s;h and abound. Above all, watch carefully over the educa|tion of your children. It is from public &s;chools, be a&s;|&s;ured, that come the wi&s;e magi&s;trates, the capable and courageous &s;oldiers, the good fathers, the good hu&s;bands, the good brothers, the good friends, the good men. Wherever the youth are &s;een depraved, the nation is on the decline. Let liberty have an immoveable foundation in the wi&s;dom of your laws, and let it be the inde&s;tructi|ble cement to bind your provinces together. E&s;tabli&s;h no legal preference among&s;t the different forms of wor&s;hip. Super&s;tition is innocent, wherever it is neither per&s;ecuted nor protected; and may your duration, if it be po&s;&s;ible, equal the duration of the world!</P>
