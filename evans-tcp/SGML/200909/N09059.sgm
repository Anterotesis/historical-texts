<HEAD>The Fourth DIALOGUE Between a MINISTER and his PARISHIONER.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pari&s;hioner.</SPEAKER>
<P>SIR, three times I have been with you here|tofore, to get my child baptized; and I am now come to make you a fourth vi&s;it, with the <HI>letter,</HI> lately printed at <HI>New-Haven,</HI> in my hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mini&s;ter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am willing, Sir, and ever have been, to oblige you in all things wherein I lawfully may. And particularly, I am willing to baptize your child, if you, really under&s;tanding the true import of the action, are wil|ling to offer your child in bapti&s;m; even, to <HI>dedicate it to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Gho&s;t;</HI> in who&s;e name it is to be baptized. But, if you do indeed love God &s;o well, as that you are willing to give him your child, to be his for ever; why are you not as willing, to give him your &s;elf? And why &s;hould you not, fir&s;t of all, give your &s;elf up to God thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and then, after that, give your child to him? In this way God will become your covenant God and Father in this world, and your eternal portion in the next. This is all I wait for. And this is what I have, from the beginning, been urg|ing upon you, as your immediate, indi&s;pen&s;ible duty. You remember what I &s;aid to you in your fir&s;t vi&s;it,
<Q>if you love God &s;o, as to be willing to have him for your por|tion; if you love Chri&s;t &s;o, as to be willing to deny your &s;elf, take up your cro&s;s and follow him; you may have your choice: you may do as you like: <HI>Come, for all things are now ready.</HI> And if you would now in fact make this choice, it would put an end to your pre&s;ent
<PB N="4" REF="011566_0003_0F87261809B01270">
difficulties about your child. Nothing, therefore, can hinder the bapti&s;m of your child, but your continuing to reject God and the Redeemer, by which you practi|cally renounce your own bapti&s;m, and forfeit all the ble&s;&s;ings of the covenant.</Q>&mdash; And you remember my parting words in your la&s;t vi&s;it,
<Q>every circum&s;tance of your own &s;oul, and every circum&s;tance of your dear offspring, calls upon you, without delay, to awake, and to turn to God thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in &s;incerity and truth.&mdash;O, what joy would it give me, e're long, to admit you into full communion with the church, on a profe&s;&s;ion of a compliance with the covenant of grace, in which you &s;hould appear to act under&s;tandingly and hone&s;tly!</Q>&mdash;And you are my witne&s;s, that, at all times, I am ready to in&s;truct you, to pray for you, and, if need be, to rebuke you, with all tenderne&s;s and kindne&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>In&s;pired by the &s;pirit, which runs thro' the <HI>New-Haven letter,</HI> I mu&s;t &s;ay, that I di&s;pi&s;e your rebukes, p. 4. and do not de&s;ire your prayers, p. 18. "Could I &s;uffi|ciently di&s;&s;emble, I &s;hould <HI>give you joy,</HI> and gain a &s;peedy, ea&s;y admittance into your church." p. 10.&mdash;But, for my part, I look upon you, as little or nothing better than the very wor&s;t of hereticks. For <Q>your principles, Sir, are too near of kin to tho&s;e mo&s;t &s;hocking principles, lately broach'd in the land, by &s;everal who have a fond|ne&s;s for being authors; particularly, by Mr. Sandeman and Mr. Hopkins. Mr. Sandeman &s;ays, that <HI>faith is obtained, as the mo&s;t remarkable di&s;coveries have been obtain|ed, the u&s;e of the magnet, Je&s;uit's-bark, and many chimical di&s;coveries, i. e. not when the&s;e things, but &s;ome thing el&s;e was looked for.</HI>&mdash;Mr. Hopkins &s;ays, <HI>it is indeed, as great an ab&s;urdity as can be thought of, to &s;uppo&s;e that the corrupt, vicious heart does any thing towards becoming holy.</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;<HI>for all the exerci&s;es and volitions of the corrupt unregenerate heart are certainly the exerci&s;es of &s;in.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>The&s;e principles, Sir, I look upon of the mo&s;t dan|gerous tendency, of any that were ever broach'd in the chri&s;tian world, dei&s;m it&s;elf not excepted.</Q> p 20.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Sir, be cool, and think a minute or two, who you are, and what you &s;ay, and what you have been doing. You are my pari&s;hioner. In this character you have made me three vi&s;its before this. In this character you are now talking with me. You knew my principles before you ever de&s;ired me to baptize your child. And you knew that the church under my care profe&s;s to be in the &s;ame &s;cheme of religion with me. And would you de&s;ire, that your child &s;hould be baptized by the wor&s;t of hereticks! Or would you de&s;ire to join with &s;uch a church! Where is the hone&s;ty or con&s;i&s;tence of your conduct! You are in&s;pired with a <HI>&s;pirit</HI> indeed; but I fear, you <HI>know not what &s;pirit you are of.</HI></P>
<P>As to our &s;entiments touching <HI>total depravity, works done by unregenerate men,</HI> and the <HI>&s;overeignty of divine grace in the conver&s;ion of &s;inners,</HI> we profe&s;s to agree with the <HI>a&s;&s;embly of divines at We&s;tmini&s;ter.</HI> And you know, that their <HI>confe&s;&s;ion of faith,</HI> and <HI>larger</HI> and <HI>&s;horter catechi&s;ms</HI> are adopted by the church of Scotland, as their te&s;t of orthodoxy; and are much the &s;ame with the <HI>Savoy confe&s;&s;ien of faith,</HI> which is adopted, in general, by the churches in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and in Connecticut.&mdash;But,</P>
<P>The&s;e public formulas declare, as to <HI>total depravety,</HI> that "we are utterly indi&s;po&s;ed, di&s;abled and oppo&s;ite to all good, and wholly inclined to all evil."&mdash;And as to <HI>works done by unregenerate men,</HI> that
<Q>altho' for the matter of them, they may be things which God commands, and of good u&s;e to them&s;elves and others; yet, becau&s;e they proceed not from a heart purified by faith, nor are done in a right manner, according to the word; nor to a right end, the glory of God; they are therefore &s;inful and cannot plea&s;e God, or make a man meet to receive grace from God. And yet their neglect of them is more &s;inful and di&s;plea&s;ing to God.</Q>&mdash; And as to the <HI>divine &s;overeignty in the conver&s;ion of &s;inners,</HI> they &s;ay, that
<Q>all tho&s;e whom God hath prede&s;tinated unto life, and tho&s;e only, he is plea&s;ed in his appointed and accepted time effectually to call,
<PB N="6" REF="011566_0004_0F8726181341CB58">
&amp;c.&mdash;This effectual call is of God's free and &s;pecial grace alone, not from any thing at all fore&s;een in man, who is altogether pa&s;&s;ive therein, until being quickened and renewed by the Holy Spirit, he is thereby enabled to an&s;wer this call,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And the famous Mr. Stoddard, in his <HI>treati&s;e concerning the nature of conver&s;ion,</HI> &s;ays, p. 7. <Q>If men do not act from gracious motives and for gracious ends, they do not the thing that God commands; there is no obedience to God in what they do: they don't attend the will of God." And p. 9. "There is an oppo&s;ition between &s;aving grace and common grace&mdash;common graces are lu&s;ts and do oppo&s;e &s;aving grace. Making his own &s;alvation his end, is contrary to making the glory of God his la&s;t end: hating &s;in, not becau&s;e it wrongs God, but becau&s;e it expo&s;es him, is re&s;i&s;ting the com|mand of God: bringing every thing into &s;ub&s;erviency to his own ends, is oppo&s;ite to the bringing every thing into a &s;ub&s;erviency to God's glory: The man that hath but common grace goeth quite in another path than that which God directs unto: When he goeth about to e&s;tabli&s;h his own righteou&s;ne&s;s, he &s;ets him&s;elf again&s;t that way of &s;alvation which God pre&s;cribes. Rom. 10.3. There is an enmity in the ways of &s;uch men as have but common grace, to the ways that godly men take.</Q> Thus Mr. Stoddard.</P>
<P>And now, my pari&s;hioner, I appeal to you, to judge, whether the&s;e quotations, out of the confe&s;&s;ion of faith and Mr. Stoddard,&mdash;<Q>are not as near of kin to tho&s;e &s;hock|ing principles, which you look upon of the mo&s;t dan|gerous tendency, of any that were ever broach'd in the chri&s;tian world, dei&s;m it&s;elf not excepted,</Q> as any thing I ever advanced from the pulpit or the pre&s;s.</P>
<P>And if &s;ome of the important doctrines of chri&s;tianity are more obnoxious to you than dei&s;m it&s;elf; that is, if you are nearer a dei&s;t than you are a chri&s;tian; certainly you are not fit to be a church member, or to offer your
<PB N="7" REF="011566_0004_0F8726181341CB58">
child in bapti&s;m, or to partake of the Lord's-&s;upper, ac|cording to your own principles: For, you &s;ay, that men mu&s;t be orthodox. And you cannot deny, that the church of Scotland, and the churches in New-England have as good a right to judge for them&s;elves, what prin|ciples are agreeable to the word of God, and of importance to be profe&s;&s;ed, as you have to judge for your &s;elf. We are willing, that tho&s;e who look upon the doctrines con|tained in our public formulas, as being wor&s;e than dei&s;m, &s;hould hold communion among them&s;elves, but we think it an incon&s;i&s;tence in them to de&s;ire to be members of our churches.</P>

<P><Q>Unholy obedience is a contradiction in terms, for holine&s;s and obedience are the &s;ame thing.</Q> p. 8.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>In &s;aying this, you condemn Mr. Mather's &s;cheme of an external gracele&s;s covenant, by whole&s;ale.&mdash;How|ever, &s;trictly &s;peaking, what you &s;ay, is true. And in this view Mr. Stoddard's words are exactly right, (&s;peaking of the unregenerate) 'There is no obedience to God in what they do.' And thus it is &s;aid by the church of England in her 39 articles. <Q>Works done before the grace of Chri&s;t, and the in&s;piration of his &s;pirit, are not plea&s;ant to God.&mdash;Yea, rather, for that they are not done as God hath commanded and willed them to be done, we doubt not but that they have the nature of &s;in.</Q> See article 13.&mdash;Do you, Sir, believe this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. Far from it. Rather I believe, that <Q>all the obedience of an unconverted man is holy obedience.</Q> Yea, I believe, that <Q>the obedience of an unrenewed man, &s;o far forth as it is obedience, is as holy as any, that a gracious man can yield. Tho' 'tis but a partial and im|perfect obedience, yet ju&s;t &s;o much as there is of obedi|ence, ju&s;t &s;o much holine&s;s.</Q>&mdash;And&mdash;'a mea&s;ure of &s;trength is given him by God, to walk in all his ways and keep all his Commands, &s;eeking his glory.' p. 8, 9. &mdash;And in any other view, I mu&s;t acknowledge, that the inconverted covenanter would be 'perjured.' For <HI>to &s;wear to obey a covenant which we cannot obey is perjury.</HI> And there|fore
<PB N="8" REF="011566_0005_0F872618CD317100">
had the unconverted no power to yield a holy obe|dience, it would be perjury in them to enter into covenant engagements to do it. p. 8.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I under&s;tand you right, and you are in earne&s;t in this declaration, then you believe that the unconverted are, in a mea&s;ure, really holy. And, therefore, are not totally depraved, as is a&s;&s;erted in the confe&s;&s;ion of faith adopted by our churches. And if this be &s;o, then you are not &s;ound in the faith. And tho&s;e who are not found in the faith have no right to church privileges, according to your own principles. You, therefore, cannot con&s;i&s;tently claim church privileges of any of our churches. &mdash; Indeed, you may think our confe&s;&s;ion of faith not agreeable to the word of God, and you may think the &s;ame of the articles of the church of England: If, therefore, you would act a con&s;i&s;tent part, you &s;hould join, neither with us, nor them; but, rather form a new church, on a new plan, with tho&s;e who think as you do. For, it is ab&s;urd for tho&s;e, who differ in e&s;&s;entials, to walk together, as brethren. And to profe&s;s our belief of articles of religion, which we do not believe, for the &s;ake of church privileges, is as gro&s;s di&s;&s;i|mulation in the laity among us, as it is in the clergy in England, who &s;ub&s;cribe the 39 articles of that church, in order to enjoy a benefice, when they do not believe them, as in the ca&s;e with the Arians, Socinians and Arminians a|mong them.&mdash;In a word, if you really di&s;believe the doc|trines of <HI>total depravity</HI> and of <HI>divine &s;overeignty,</HI> you can by no means con&s;i&s;tently join with us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P><Q>The&s;e principles deny the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the unre|generate to be a &s;tate of probation: they deny him to be a moral agent: they deny the ju&s;tice of puni&s;hment for any &s;in.</Q> p. 21.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>So &s;ays Dr. Taylor, &s;o &s;ays Dr. Whitby, &s;o &s;ays Dr. Stebbins, and all other Pelegian and Arminian writers I ever read. They all agree, that the doctrines of <HI>total depravity,</HI> and of <HI>divine &s;overeignty,</HI> as held by the Calvini&s;ts, are ab&s;o|lutely incon&s;i&s;tent with moral agency. They have &s;aid it a
<PB N="9" REF="011566_0005_0F872618CD317100">
thou&s;and times, and they have been an&s;wered as often.&mdash; Thus &s;tands the controver&s;y.&mdash;"Becau&s;e I have no heart to love GOD, therefore I cannot be bound in duty to love him."&mdash;"Becau&s;e I am <HI>dead in &s;in,</HI> and oppo&s;ite to all good;" therefore that law which &s;ays, <HI>Cur&s;ed is every one that continueth not in all things,</HI> cannot ju&s;tly reach me."&mdash; "Becau&s;e we all, with one con&s;ent, excu&s;e our&s;elves from coming to the go&s;pel fea&s;t; therefore we are not in a &s;tate of probation."&mdash;"Becau&s;e GOD &s;ays, <HI>may I not do what I will with my own?</HI> Therefore, we may &s;ay, we are not in duty bound, to regard his law, or hearken to his go&s;pel."&mdash; Rea&s;oning, which, if it has weight in it, proves the funda|mental maxims of the bible to be be fal&s;e; for, that book teaches, that we may be <HI>dead in &s;in,</HI> and yet <HI>de&s;erve to be damned</HI> for that &s;in: That GOD is not <HI>obliged</HI> in ju&s;tice, or by promi&s;e, to grant converting grace to any impenitent &s;inner; and yet it is the duty of &s;uch &s;inners <HI>every where to repent.</HI>&mdash;But, you may, at your lei&s;ure, &s;ee my &s;entiments on the&s;e &s;ubjects at large, and my confutation of Mr. San|deman's &s;cheme of religion, both at once, in a book lately printed at Bo&s;ton; entitled, <HI>An e&s;&s;ay on the nature and glory of the go&s;pel.</HI>&mdash;However,</P>
<P>I will readily grant, that there is an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, of denying total depravity, on the one hand; or, of giving up the covenant of grace, and &s;ub&s;tituting a gracele&s;s cove|nant in its room, on the other hand; in order to open a door for the unconverted, as &s;uch, to enter into covenant with GOD, and join in full communion with the church, con&s;i&s;tently with truth and hone&s;ty.&mdash;But, yet, &s;o it happens, that, on either plan men cannot con&s;i&s;tently be admitted into our churches.&mdash;For, if they deny total depravity, they mu&s;t be deemed not &s;ound in the faith, according to our approved &s;tandard; and, therefore, mu&s;t not be admitted. And if they &s;ub&s;titute a gracele&s;s covenant in the room of the covenant of grace, they go off from the plan on which our churches were originally founded; and &s;o, con&s;i&s;tantly, cannot be members of them.&mdash;We mu&s;t have a new confe&s;&s;ion of faith, and a
<PB N="10" REF="011566_0006_0F87261CEA853160">
new plan of church order, and form new churches, before either of the&s;e ways will an&s;wer the end.&mdash;Be&s;ides, if the unconverted have a degree of real holine&s;s, and do, tho' in an imperfect manner, yet really comply with the covenant of grace, then the unconverted are, in fact, entituled not only to the &s;eals, but al&s;o to all the ble&s;&s;ings of the covenant of grace; even to pardon, ju&s;tification, and eternal life. Than which nothing can be more contrary to the whole tenor of &s;cripture, which every where declares all &s;uch to be under the wrath of GOD, and cur&s;e of the law, con|demned already liable to be &s;truck dead and &s;ent to hell at any moment.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>You can, if you will do as they did, viz. <HI>Flatter him with your mouth and lie unto him with your tongue.</HI> But then, you ought not to take it ill, if the true nature of your con|duct, is from the word of God, &s;et in a clear light before you.</P>

<SPEAKER>P:</SPEAKER>
<P>But I do take it ill: indeed I do.&mdash;Particularly, the rebuke you gave me for di&s;&s;imulation, in my la&s;t vi&s;it, I do not take well at your hands. For I am not the guilty man. p. 3.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Man, I rebuked for di&s;&s;imulation, was my pari&s;h|ioner, who&s;e conver&s;ation with me was printed in the <HI>New-Ha|ven Dialogue;</HI> and who, in his fir&s;t vi&s;it, told me, 'that he did not mean to profe&s;s a compliance with the covenant of grace, when he <HI>owned the covenant.</HI>'&mdash;On which, I let him know, that he, for that very rea&s;on, had no right, by virtue of that profe&s;&s;ion, to claim the &s;eal of the covenant of grace for his child. For, this very &s;ame man, afterwards, came again to me, to baptize that very &s;ame child, and put on a bold face, and declared, that "he had entered into that covenant," and, therefore, had a right to the &s;eal of it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>"I &s;hall not trouble my &s;elf to defend this pari&s;hioner again&s;t the charge of di&s;&s;imulation." p. 4. But I am not the &s;ame man. p. 3.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you are not the &s;ame man, why do you take the charge of di&s;&s;imulation to your &s;elf <HI>now?</HI> Or why did you
<PB N="11" REF="011566_0006_0F87261CEA853160">
pretend to be the &s;ame man <HI>then?</HI> Why did you call your &s;elf by the &s;ame name? And why did you begin with me in the&s;e words? "Sir, I find the dialogue which pa&s;&s;ed be|tween us the other day is printed."&mdash;Is it not evident, by this, that you intended, then, that I &s;hould con&s;ider you, as the very &s;ame man? but no &s;ooner do I find you con|contradicting your&s;elf, and rebuke you for it, but you cry out, "This dialogue did not pa&s;s between you and me." &mdash;To u&s;e your own words, Sir, "'tis ea&s;y to &s;ee your un|lucky mi&s;take."&mdash;And "'tis really plea&s;ant enough" to &s;ee you drove to a nece&s;&s;ity, of changing your name, in order to get rid of the fault, which, otherwi&s;e, you mu&s;t, even in your own judgment, be reputed guilty of. We have heard of mens changing their names, when pur&s;ued for their crimes, that they might avoid their pur&s;uers, but did you, before now, ever hear of a pari&s;hioner, that went to his mini&s;ter to get his child baptized, that did &s;o?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be this as it may, the grand que&s;tion is this, viz.
<Q>Can a man, who knows he has no grace, profe&s;s a com|pliance with the covenant of grace, without wilful ly|ing?</Q>
p. 5.&mdash;You &s;ay, he cannot.&mdash;I &s;ay, he can.&mdash; Indeed, once, I was of your opinion; and this was the rea&s;on I did not join in full communion; but I am of another mind now. And I can, tho' I know I have no grace, yet make a profe&s;&s;ion of a compliance with the co|venant of grace, as hone&s;tly as any man.&mdash;And to charge any one with wilful lying for this, is virtually to charge the mini&s;ters and churches thro' the land with that horrid crime. p. 3.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>As this is a matter of importance, it de&s;erves to be thought of &s;eriou&s;ly, and to be thoro'ly looked into. And if you will be &s;erious, only long enough to under&s;tand the propo&s;ition, you will be forced to believe it.&mdash;For,</P>

<P>When, therefore, it is &s;aid, that "a man, who knows that he has no grace, cannot profe&s;s a compliance with the Covenant of grace, without wilful lying;" the truth of the propo&s;ition is as evident, as when it is &s;aid, that "a man who knows that two and two are but four, cannot &s;ay, that two and two are five, without wilful lying." And, therefore, as &s;oon as the propo&s;ition is under&s;tood, it can|not but be believed. There is no way to avoid it.&mdash;For,</P>
<P N="1">1. If you explain down the covenant of grace, into a gracele&s;s covenant, with which a gracele&s;s heart may really comply, it will not help your cau&s;e in the lea&s;t.

For, this gracele&s;s man, &s;o called, is, in fact, a gracious man, and is intitled not only to the &s;eals, but al&s;o to the ble&s;&s;ings of the covenant of grace.
<PB N="13" REF="011566_0007_0F87261E1D46C810">
Becau&s;e, he does, in fact, comply with it.&mdash;Rather, it runs you into the ab&s;urdity, of &s;aying, that &s;ome unconverted, gracele&s;s &s;inners, are real converts and true &s;aints, and have a title to eternal life, i. e. of expre&s;sly contradicting your &s;elf.&mdash;Or,</P>
<P N="3">3. If you &s;ay, "a gracele&s;s &s;inner may comply with the covenant of grace, with moral &s;incerity, tho' not with gra|cious &s;incerity:" it will not help your cau&s;e, For there is but one kind of real complying with the covenant of grace; and this entitles to eternal life. For he that really complies with the covenant of grace, doth, in &s;o doing act graciou&s;ly. Thus, he who loves God &s;upremely, with moral &s;incerity, does love God &s;upremely, in reality; but this real &s;upreme love to God is a gracious and holy love to God. And you have already &s;aid, "that obedience to God is always holy"&mdash;"and the obedience of the unre|newed, as holy as any, that a gracious man can yield." p. 8. But if &s;o, then this obedience is performed with gra|cious &s;incerity, as really as the obedience of any gracious man is.&mdash;But, if your gracele&s;s man does comply with the covevant of grace, in a gracious manner, he will go to hea|ven along with true &s;aints.

<P>It remains, therefore, that this propo&s;ition mu&s;t pa&s;s for a &s;elf-evident truth, which cannot but be believed, as &s;oon as it is under&s;tood, viz. <Q>A man, who knows he has no grace, cannot profe&s;s a compliance with the covenant of grace, without wilful lying.</Q>&mdash;You may as well &s;ay, that <HI>black is white,</HI> or that <HI>a dead man is alive</HI> or that a <HI>gracele&s;s &s;in|ner is a real &s;aint,</HI> as &s;ay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> "a man, who knows he has no grace, can profe&s;s a compliance with the covenant of grace, hone&s;tly and with a good con&s;cience."&mdash;And, there|fore, a man mu&s;t either not know what he is about, or his con&s;cience mu&s;t be very much &s;eared, or he will not dare to profe&s;s a compliance with the covenant of grace, while he knows he has no grace. Indeed, it is a full proof, that
<PB N="14" REF="011566_0008_0F87261EDE8A92B0">
a man is to a great degree de&s;titute of moral hone&s;ty, if, with his eyes open, he dare to make &s;uch a profe&s;&s;ion.

<P>To be con&s;i&s;tent, therefore, we mu&s;t vote the covenant of grace out, in our church, and vote in a gracele&s;s cove|nant in its room, or you cannot be admitted as a member.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>P.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shocking con&s;equence! However, this I lay down for an infallible truth, that all who have vi&s;ibly entered into covenant, as I have done, "to walk in all God's ways and to keep all his commands," are bound by their own vow to attend &s;pecial ordinances. p. 10, 11, 12.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! Bound, tho' they know them&s;elves to be un|qualified? Is the abovementioned infidel and adulterer bound? What! bound in the &s;ight of GOD and a well re|gulated con&s;cience, to come to the Lord's table, as he is? Pray, who bound him? GOD never did: nor does the vow he publickly made to "walk in all GOD'S ways and keep all his commands" bind him to come <HI>as he is.</HI> For, this, is what GOD <HI>never commanded.</HI></P>
<P>And it is equally evident, that GOD never commanded men to make a lying profe&s;&s;ion, in any in&s;tance, either ver|bally, or practically. But to &s;eal a covenant is (practically)
<PB N="16" REF="011566_0009_0F87261FA664C410">
to profe&s;s a compliance with it. To &s;eal a covenant, there|fore, with which we know we do not comply, is what GOD <HI>ne|ver commanded.</HI> Yea, it is what GOD has forbidden in every text in the bible, which forbids lying. So that, if the co|venant to be &s;ealed in bapti&s;m and the Lord's-&s;upper is the covenant of grace, as you allow it is, then tho&s;e who know they have no grace are forbidden to &s;eal it, by every text in the bible, which forbids lying. And, therefore, that command, <HI>do this in remembrance of me,</HI> is, beyond all doubt, a command which re&s;pects believers, and them only; a|greeable to the publickly profe&s;&s;ed belief of the church of, Scotland, and the churches in New-England, held forth in their public formulas.&mdash;Indeed, it is the duty, the indi&s;pen|&s;able duty of every one to whom the go&s;pel comes, and their highe&s;t intere&s;t, to comply with the covenant of grace, and that on the very fir&s;t invitation. As &s;oon as the glad tydings come to our ears, <HI>come, for all things are now ready, who|&s;oever will let him come.</HI> We ought not to delay a moment, we ought not to make one excu&s;e, we ought not to feel the lea&s;t reluctance: no, rather, on the contrary, we ought with Peter's hearers, <HI>to receive the word gladly</HI> that &s;ame day, and to make a public profe&s;&s;ion and join with the church the fir&s;t opportunity. Mat. 13.44.&mdash;And to neglect this, is a &s;in &s;o great and aggravated, as to expo&s;e the neglecters to be given up of GOD in this world, Luke 14.24. And to be ca&s;t off for ever in the world to come. Mark 16.16. So that your mouth is &s;topped, and you &s;tand guilty be|fore GOD.&mdash;But, to return, to a con&s;ideration of your vi|&s;ible &s;tanding.&mdash;Pray, &s;ir, was you e&s;teemed a church member, in full communion, in the town where you lived, before you moved into this pari&s;h?</P>

But if bapti&s;m delivers men from the covenant of works, they cannot <HI>any one of them</HI> be under its cur&s;e. For no man is liable to the cur&s;e of a law which he is not under. Be&s;ides, in this Apo&s;tles view of things, it was peculiar to true believers to be really in the covenant of grace, and not under the law as a covenant of works. Rom. 6.14. <HI>For &s;in &s;hall not have dominion over you, for ye are not under law, but under grace.</HI> For according to this &s;cheme of re|ligion, every &s;oul is either <HI>married to the law;</HI> and the&s;e <HI>bring forth fruit unto death;</HI> or <HI>married to Chri&s;t;</HI> and the&s;e <HI>bring forth fruit unto God.</HI> (chap. 7.) Wherefore, know a&s;|&s;uredly, that your bapti&s;m, altho' it increa&s;es your obliga|tions and &s;o enhances your guilt; yet it, alone, gives you not the lea&s;t right to any one of the peculiar ble&s;&s;ings of the covenant of grace, &s;o as at all to exempt you from the cur&s;e of the law; but you are now, this moment, in fact, as li|able to be &s;truck dead and &s;ent to hell, by the Divine Ju&s;|tice; as any unbaptized &s;inner in the land. And &s;hould you die in the &s;tate you are now in, you would mo&s;t cer|tainly be damned along with the unbaptized heathen: only your hell would be hotter than theirs. Mat. 11.20&mdash;24.
<PB N="22" REF="011566_0012_0F87262227622358">
For <HI>if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumci&s;ion is made un|circumci&s;ion.</HI> Rom. 2.25.&mdash;Wherefore, I advi&s;e you,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t of all, immediately to repent of your &s;ins, and re|turn to God thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t, looking only to free grace thro' him for pardon and eternal life. For I te&s;tify unto you, that if you tru&s;t in your bapti&s;m to recommend you to God, Chri&s;t &s;hall profit you nothing. Gal. 5.2. Where|fore; give up this, and all your other &s;elf-righteous claims, and apply to the mere, pure, free grace of God thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as all your hope. For, as to acceptance with God, <HI>there is no difference,</HI> between the circumci&s;ed Jew and the uncircumci&s;ed Greek, or between the baptized nominal Chri&s;tian and an unbaptized Indian. Rom. 3.22. If you will thus <HI>repent and believe the go&s;pel,</HI> and in this way, not in fal&s;ehood, but in truth, "avouch the Lord Jehovah to be your &s;overeign Lord and &s;upreme good thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t," you &s;hall, in fact, have your choice, that is, have God for your God and portion in time and eternity. This, my dear Pari&s;hioner, this is the way to take upon you your bapti&s;mal covenant, and to get delivered from the cur&s;e of the covenant of works, and to enter into the covenant of grace, in reality and in truth.&mdash;This therefore do without delay.&mdash;And having done this, then make a public pro|fe&s;&s;ion of religion, and join your&s;elf to God's people, and bring your dear child and dedicate it to the &s;ame God to whom you have dedicated your&s;elf. And let it be the bu|&s;ine&s;s of your life to bring up that, and your other chil|dren, in <HI>the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>And now as you travel thro' the country, for I un|der&s;tand you are become a great traveller and gain ad|mittance into all companies, and among men of all de|nominations and character, I advi&s;e you to u&s;e your utmo&s;t influence, to diffu&s;e a friendly &s;pirit every where, among all your acquaintance, in this controver&s;y. Par|ticularly, urge it upon pari&s;hioners of your acquain|tance, to treat their mini&s;ters in a re&s;pectful manner,
<PB N="23" REF="011566_0012_0F87262227622358">
while they apply to them for light and in&s;truction, or when they undertake to di&s;pute the&s;e points with them, e&s;pecially, wherever your influence extends, let no man, on our &s;ide of the que&s;tion, treat his mini&s;ter ill, becau&s;e he is in the oppo&s;ite &s;cheme. It is not man|ly, it is not chri&s;tian-like, it is not prudent to do it. For there is no way to promote truth &s;o effectually, as to hold forth light in love; and to treat your oppo|nents in a kind and friendly manner.&mdash;For my part, I have an high e&s;teem for many in the mini&s;try, who differ in their practice in the admi&s;&s;ion of per&s;ons to &s;ealing ordinances for them&s;elves and for their children, from what I think is right. For it is a controver&s;y which has not been attended to, nor is it an ea&s;y thing, at once, to get rid of the prejudices of education, and in the face of a frowning world to e&s;pou&s;e the true &s;cripture plan. I have great hopes, however, that, ere long, we &s;hall think and act nearer alike, when there has been &s;ufficient time to under&s;tand one another, to weigh and deliberate, to get rid of the prejudices of e|ducation, &amp;c. &amp;c. In the mean time, I mo&s;t earne&s;tly de&s;ire, that the controver&s;y may be carried on, in the mo&s;t open, fair, hone&s;t, cool, calm, friendly manner po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Who this <HI>letter-writer</HI> is, is not know by the pub|lic, as he has &s;ecreted his name. And whether it was on de&s;ign, or thro' inadvertance, that he hath gi|ven up the doctrine of total depravity, as held forth in &s;cripture and in our public formulas, I &s;hall not deter|mine. Perhaps, on &s;econd thoughts, he will retract e|very thing he hath &s;aid, which hath that a&s;pect. I wi&s;h he may. But if it &s;hould come to pa&s;s, as I fear it will, that in the cour&s;e of this controver&s;y, numbers
<PB N="24" REF="011566_0013_0F87262296153E78">
&s;hould openly fall off to the Arminian &s;cheme, in or|der to defend their lax manner of admi&s;&s;ion to &s;eal|ing ordinances, I advi&s;e you, to keep by you, and to &s;pread every where among your acquaintance, the We&s;tmini&s;ter confe&s;&s;ion of faith, &amp; larger and &s;horter catechi&s;ms: a book, which will be of excellent &s;ervice to teach people &s;ound doctrine, and to guard them a|gain&s;t Arminian errors.</P>
<P>To conclude, I &s;hall always retain a mo&s;t grateful &s;en&s;e of your kind treatment of your mini&s;ter, <HI>when acting your&s;elf,</HI> and be always ready to do every kind office in my power, which either you, or any other of my pari&s;hioners &s;hall need at my hands. I e&s;teem it among the great ble&s;&s;ings of my life, that I live in a pari&s;h, and among a people, &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed to treat a mini&s;ter with that re&s;pect which is due to his office. And I hope you may never find me wanting in any in&s;tance of kind and friendly conduct towards you.&mdash; I wi&s;h you the be&s;t of heaven's ble&s;&s;ings.&mdash;My dear pari&s;hioner, adieu.</P>
