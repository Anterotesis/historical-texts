<HEAD>A LETTER to Mr. BENJAMIN LORD, of NORWICH.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend and Honoured SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_TO <HI>do to others as we would have them do to us,</HI> mu&s;t be allowed to be the uni|ver&s;al rule of equity; yet, alas! how far is it from being univer&s;ally practi|&s;ed? and I have thought that it is often as little regarded in the manage|ment of di&s;putes about religion, as in almo&s;t any affair at all: a view of which has cau&s;ed in my mind, the&s;e many years, a great cautiou&s;ne&s;s of engaging in any warm debates: tho' where the cau&s;e of truth really calls for it, no doubt there is warrant &s;till to appear in it's defence. Such a call &s;eems now to pre&s;ent it&s;elf to my view; for as you, Sir, have lately exerted your&s;elf con&s;iderably, to &s;upport the cau&s;e of the churches and mini&s;try that are e&s;tabli&s;hed by law in our land, &s;o you have not failed to repre&s;ent the characters and &s;entiments of tho&s;e who have lately di&s;&s;ented therefrom, in very odious, and I believe, in very unju&s;t colours. In your &s;ermon at Mr. <HI>Hart</HI>'s ordination at <HI>Pre&s;ton,</HI> 1762, you a&s;&s;ert, that <Q>no ju&s;t cau&s;e of withdrawment from your a&s;&s;emblies can be produced,</Q> and a&s;k, <Q>what meaneth this conduct?</Q> which &s;eems to require an an&s;wer;
<PB N="4" REF="009587_0003_0F76DBAB206B2220">
tho' you immediately &s;ay, <Q>I only put the que&s;tion, and leave it to CHRIST and con&s;cience for a de|ci&s;ion.</Q> Page 28.&mdash;But if it was left there then, yet you, Sir, and &s;ix of your neighbouring brethren, have &s;o far taken the ca&s;e into your own hands &s;ince, as that, in a preface which you have added to a new edition of Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on's dialogue</HI> about <HI>infant bap|ti&s;m,</HI> ju&s;t publi&s;hed, after mentioning the direction to mini&s;ters, to <HI>blow the trumpet in Zion, and &s;ound the alarm in the holy mountain,</HI> and then ju&s;t touching upon &s;ome other evils, which now expo&s;e us to GOD'S judgments, you go on to &s;ay, <Q>very e&s;pecially, the error and iniquity of <HI>going in the way of Cain,</HI> and following the example of <HI>the gain&s;aying of Core,</HI> in departing from GOD'S in&s;titutions, and without any &s;criptural warrant, &s;etting up &s;eparately them|&s;elves.</Q> Page 4. And in page 7, you proceed in &s;ounding the alarm, thus, <Q>Do not the late &s;epara|tions, and one &s;eparation from another, already di&s;cover their nature by their fruits? in that &s;ome have by this time apo&s;tati&s;ed even from all religion: while &s;ome others are renouncing infant bapti&s;m, and going fa&s;t to the like dreadful apo&s;tacy.&mdash;It is hid from them, that <HI>evil men and &s;educers wax wor&s;e and wor&s;e:</HI> it is hid from them, or rather, they will not &s;ee that they have fell <HI>into the way of Cain,</HI> and are in danger of <HI>peri&s;hing in the gain&s;aying of Core.</HI></Q> Thus Sir, you and your brethren have decided the ca&s;e with a witne&s;s, and if there was no appeal from your judgment, in your own cau&s;e, our ca&s;e would be &s;ad indeed. I &s;ay <HI>in your own cau&s;e;</HI> for the whole procedure evidently goes upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, that your mini&s;ters are as certainly right, as tho&s;e were that <HI>Core</HI> appeared again&s;t, and that your churches in their pre&s;ent order, are as certainly right as tho&s;e which <HI>evil men and &s;educers</HI> departed from in <HI>Paul</HI>'s
<PB N="5" REF="009587_0004_0F76DBABD504D048">
time: and if &s;o, then pray who is it that are <Q>in their own e&s;teem, holier and better than others.</Q> Page 7.</P>
<P>NOW as I happen to be one again&s;t whom this dreadful indictment is laid, for leaving your church, and &s;ince that infant bapti&s;m, the law of &s;elf-defence will warrant a criminal to &s;peak, before he is con|demned; but the nobler principle of regard to the honor of GOD and good of &s;ouls, even demand a reply, when truth and reformation are repre&s;ented by men of note, as error and apo&s;tacy, which I believe in my heart is the ca&s;e here. Therefore, without any further apology, I &s;hall make a few <HI>remarks</HI> upon &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in your late writings, and then give &s;ome of the &s;cripture <HI>grounds</HI> and <HI>rea&s;ons</HI> of my &s;enti|ments and conduct, in the points which you con|demn me for; and &s;o leave it to every con&s;cience to judge, whether that is ju&s;tly called the way of apo&s;tacy or no.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t remark that I &s;hall make, is upon page 18 of Mr. <HI>Hart</HI>'s ordination &s;ermon, where you &s;ay of CHRIST, <Q>He was &s;ent as well as furni&s;hed, (&s;ee <HI>Luke</HI> iv. 18, 19) and &s;o mu&s;t we be; el&s;e the di&s;|ciple covets to be above his ma&s;ter; which is the ca&s;e with tho&s;e that imagine the fullne&s;s of the &s;pirit (or &s;ingular gifts) which they think they po&s;&s;e&s;s, doth warrant their a&s;&s;uming the character, and entering on the work of mini&s;ters of CHRIST.</Q> In this, I &s;uppo&s;e, you have &s;ome reference to what I have &s;aid on that point in my di&s;cour&s;e on an <HI>internal call to preach the go&s;pel;</HI> but I am &s;orry you had not &s;tated it more fairly. We don't argue that per&s;ons have a warrant to enter into the mini&s;try, merely from their having &s;ingular gifts; but we are of opinion, that tho&s;e to whom GOD has given grace and &s;ingular gifts, he commands to improve them:
<PB N="6" REF="009587_0005_0F76DBAC93DF5760">
his command is very expre&s;s, <HI>As every man hath re|ceived the gift, even &s;o mini&s;ter the &s;ame one to another, as good &s;tewards of the manifold grace of God,</HI> &amp;c. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> iv. 10, 11. <HI>Rom.</HI> xii. 6&mdash;8. And we believe that the &s;pirit of GOD, by light and truth, mu&s;t make that clear to the &s;oul, in order for their going forth; and that his teachings and call, gives warrant &s;ufficient to go upon and improve the gifts which he has given, and that will open the way for their being introduced and ordained in the church of CHRIST. You go on to &s;ay, <Q>And what great confu&s;ion doth this tend unto? would it not tend to throw the STATE into confu&s;ion if any man that would, might &s;et up for a civil magi&s;trate, who thought him&s;elf fit, and could find a party to encourage and follow him? and why &s;hould it not tend to make the &s;ame mi&s;|chief in the church?</Q> But would Mr. <HI>Lord</HI> have us under&s;tand that he claims the &s;ame power in the church, for him&s;elf and brethren, as rulers have in the &s;tate, to give commi&s;&s;ions to &s;uch only as they plea&s;e? If mini&s;ters have &s;uch power given them, why did <HI>Zion</HI>'s king reprove his di&s;ciples for a&s;&s;um|ing the power of forbidding one to act in his name, becau&s;e <HI>he followed not them?</HI> and why did he tell them, when at &s;trife about who &s;hould be greate&s;t, that it &s;hould <HI>not be &s;o among</HI> them, as it was in the civil &s;tate?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mark</HI> ix. 38, 39. <HI>Matt.</HI> xx. 25, 26. <HI>Luke</HI> xxii. 24&mdash;26.</NOTE> No doubt but his in&s;tructions made <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Peter,</HI> &s;o very cautious again&s;t <HI>dominion</HI> and <HI>lord&s;hip</HI> in the church of CHRIST. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> i. 24. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> v. 3. We hold to ordination of church officers as well as you; but one main di&s;pute is about where the right of ordination lies: you, Sir, &s;hew a great di&s;like again&s;t the arguments of &s;ome, as if rea&s;on were to govern in that affair, (page 23) tho' I think
<PB N="7" REF="009587_0006_0F76DBAEC09571D0">
that you have &s;everal far-fetch'd rea&s;onings about it in that &s;ermon. In general you hold forth, that CHRIST received his commi&s;&s;ion from his Father, and that he &s;ent forth the apo&s;tles, and that they ordained <HI>Timothy</HI> and others, who were to commit the things which they had heard to faithful men, which carries it down to the mini&s;try which &s;hould continue to the end. Page. 20, 21. And by all your arguing, you plainly endeavour to repre&s;ent, that the common mi|ni&s;ters of our land, have their authority in a line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion thus down from the apo&s;tles.&mdash;Yet &s;ince them has been the apo&s;tacy of the church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and then the breaking off from that in the <HI>reformation;</HI> and in our nation, we are told by one of the be&s;t informed hi&s;torians that this country ever bred, that after the nation had been over&s;pread with <HI>popery</HI> and cruelty in <HI>Mary</HI>'s days, and queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> was ad|vanced in her &s;tead, that on <Q><HI>December</HI> 15, 1559, Dr. <HI>Parker</HI> was con&s;ecrated archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canter|bury,</HI> by three <HI>deprived</HI> bi&s;hops: then they con&s;e|crate the re&s;t.</Q> Mr. <HI>Prince</HI>'s <HI>New-England</HI>'s Chro|nology, page 98. From tho&s;e <HI>deprived</HI> bi&s;hops then, the church of <HI>England</HI> mini&s;ters derive their &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion; and they afterwards u&s;ed their power &s;o as to &s;ilence and deprive many of the be&s;t mini&s;ters in the nation, for not conforming to their corrupt ways. Numbers of the&s;e came over and &s;ettled this country: and as cen&s;ures and deprivations plainly take away all the authority which was given by them that lay on the cen&s;ure; &s;o it &s;eems that our fathers did not pre|tend to act by any power derived from the <HI>bi&s;hops;</HI> but the fir&s;t mini&s;ters in <HI>Salem, Bo&s;ton,</HI> and many other places, were ordained by their churches. See <HI>Prince</HI>'s Chronology, page 189, and Vol. II. pag. 73. Yea, we have often been told (and I believe truly&punc;) that Mr. <HI>Fitch,</HI> the fir&s;t mini&s;ter of that church which you&punc;
<PB N="8" REF="009587_0007_0F76DBAF6249A238">
Sir, now &s;tand pa&s;tor of, was ordained by the church; the two deacons being appointed by them to perform that work. And the <HI>Cambridge</HI> platform, and other writings, &s;o plainly expre&s;s it, that I can't think you will deny that they held the right of ordination to be in the church. And if it is now &s;uppo&s;ed that they erred therein, yet which way will they that de|rive their &s;ucce&s;&s;ion from them, make out a whole line clear back to the apo&s;tles? if you don't like that rea&s;on &s;hould govern in this ca&s;e, would you have us throw rea&s;on away &s;o much, as to believe gro&s;s ab|&s;urdities to be con&s;i&s;tent truths? But if this is not enough, the truths which are given into in Mr. <HI>Hart</HI>'s ordination &s;ermon, are quite &s;ufficient to &s;hew the in|con&s;i&s;tency of imagining that mini&s;terial authority is derived by an external line of an uninterrupted &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of regular ordinations down from the apo&s;tles. For (1.) you ob&s;erve, that the &s;criptures determine that <HI>bi&s;hops</HI> and <HI>pre&s;byters,</HI> or <HI>elders,</HI> are the &s;ame. Page 20. Well then, &s;urely the <HI>lord bi&s;hops,</HI> which claim &s;o much &s;uperiority over the <HI>pre&s;byters,</HI> and act &s;ingle in ordinations, are be&s;ide the &s;cripture line, and therefore can't tran&s;mit that line down to others.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) YOU ob&s;erve of mini&s;ters, that <Q>In the di&s;|charge of this mini&s;try given to them, they mu&s;t u&s;e the very word of reconciliation committed to them.&mdash;An emba&s;&s;ador &s;ent by a prince, mu&s;t keep to his orders, &s;peak the very mind of his employer, and not go a &s;tep be&s;ide his will; for, then he is be&s;ide his bu&s;ine&s;s, acts out of charac|ter, and without commi&s;&s;ion. So here, CHRIST'S emba&s;&s;adors derive their commi&s;&s;ion from him, not from the church; not from the ordainers, but from CHRIST only.</Q> Page 24, 25.</P>
<P>THIS, Sir, is right; this puts the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion where it ought to be, in the line of divine truth, and <HI>every
<PB N="9" REF="009587_0008_0F76DBB01853AD28">
one that is of the truth heareth Chri&s;t's voice.</HI> Joh. xviii. 37. But all that are out of that line, <HI>act out of character,</HI> and <HI>without commi&s;&s;ion,</HI> let them pretend to a de&s;cent from <HI>Peter</HI> or <HI>Paul,</HI> as much as they will. The ancient commi&s;&s;ion to teach and baptize, is plainly limitted there, viz. <HI>Teaching them to ob&s;erve all things, what&s;oever I have commanded you: and lo, I am with you alway even unto the end of the world. Amen.</HI> Matt. xxviii. 20. JESUS never promi&s;ed his pre|&s;ence with any who turn a&s;ide from the line of truth, let them be ordained how they will: Yea, &s;o far from it, that if <HI>Paul,</HI> or an <HI>angel from heaven,</HI> &s;hould thus turn a&s;ide, the <HI>cur&s;e</HI> and not the <HI>promi&s;e</HI> would be the con&s;equence. <HI>Gal.</HI> i. 8. And where is the <HI>pro|te&s;tant</HI> in the world, that will pretend that there has been an uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ordained mini&s;ters clear down from the apo&s;tles, who have none of them gro&s;sly <HI>perverted the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t?</HI></P>
<P>HAVING thus given &s;ome brief touches concern|ing the mini&s;try, I &s;hall nextly make a few remarks upon what you have &s;aid about bapti&s;m. In your late di&s;cour&s;e on <HI>Sober-mindedne&s;s,</HI> page 16, in warn|ing young people again&s;t erroneous per&s;ons, you &s;ay, <Q>Some few, I perceive, begin already to follow &s;uch, and to hearken unto corrupt doctrines, which tend to their renouncing of their infant bapti&s;m,&mdash; which you may be a&s;&s;ured, is a dangerous road, and often i&s;&s;ueth fatally; to which purpo&s;e might be recited, facts of ancient date in foreign countries, and in our own, enough to make both ears to tingle.</Q> And in the next page, you refer to the <HI>annabapti&s;ts</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> 240 years ago, whom Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on</HI> calls "the madmen of <HI>Mun&s;ter:</HI>" But pray, Sir, why are we &s;o often referred to them, in this controver&s;y about bapti&s;m? when we have in no re&s;pect a whit more, if &s;o much relation to them, as
<PB N="10" REF="009587_0009_0F76DBB06688D288">
you have to the <HI>pope</HI> of <HI>Rome.</HI> Were they <HI>annabap|ti&s;ts?</HI>&mdash;&s;o is he a <HI>paedobapti&s;t.</HI> Did they u&s;e violence to &s;upport their cau&s;e?&mdash;&s;o does he, even impri&s;on|ment and death, to maintain his:&mdash;and let every con|&s;cience judge which party has the greate&s;t re&s;em|blance to &s;uch methods now. You know, Sir, that there have been numerous in&s;tances of late years, among us, of impri&s;onments and confi&s;cations of goods, for no greater crime than refu&s;ing to conform to, and &s;upport that wor&s;hip which you are pleading for. I know 'tis pretended that tho&s;e people at <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> were the fir&s;t that appeared again&s;t infant bapti&s;m; but that is &s;ufficiently proved by many to be a groundle&s;s pretence. Mr. <HI>Cro&s;by,</HI> in the preface to the fir&s;t volume of his <HI>hi&s;tory of the Engli&s;h bapti&s;ts,</HI> has produced authorities from <HI>paedobapti&s;t</HI> writers, of no le&s;s than &s;even other different periods of time, which they a&s;&s;ign for the original of this opinion. Dr. <HI>Gill</HI> has done the like, in his an&s;wer to Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on</HI>'s dialogue; by which, compared with Mr. <HI>Peter Clark</HI>'s defence thereof again&s;t him, it appears, not only that many, both of mini&s;ters and people, in various parts of <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Switzerland,</HI> &s;uffered death for denying infant bapti&s;m, &s;undry years before that affair in <HI>Mun&s;ter;</HI> but al&s;o, that at &s;everal diffe|rent times, witne&s;&s;es have appeared again&s;t that prac|tice, clear back to the third century; and that is the earlie&s;t expre&s;s mention thereof, that Mr. <HI>Clark,</HI> with the help of Dr. <HI>Wall</HI>'s famous <HI>hi&s;tory of infant bapti&s;m,</HI> has been able to bring. Near the beginning of that century, <HI>Origen</HI> appeared for infant bapti&s;m, and &s;aid that it <HI>takes away the pollution of our birth;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Clark</HI>'s defence, page 111.</NOTE> but <HI>Tertullian</HI> appeared again&s;t it. So that we have as early account of that practice being oppo&s;ed, as we
<PB N="11" REF="009587_0010_0F76DBB114945B38">
have of its being expre&s;sly mentioned: And no wonder it was oppo&s;ed; for they called bapti&s;m <HI>regeneration,</HI> thinking, it &s;eems, that being <HI>born of water,</HI> intends bapti&s;m: and it &s;o, then that infants mu&s;t be bapti&s;ed, or they could not be &s;aved.</P>
<P>PERMIT me therefore, here to in&s;ert the words of Dr. <HI>Barlow,</HI> afterwards bi&s;hop of <HI>Lincoln:</HI>&mdash;he, after much &s;earch into the&s;e things, in a letter to Mr. <HI>Tombes,</HI> frankly owns thus, <HI>viz.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cro&s;by</HI>'s hi&s;tory, preface, page 56.</NOTE> <Q>The truth is, I do believe, <HI>paedobapti&s;m,</HI> how or by whom I know not, came into the world in the &s;econd century, and in the third and fourth began to be practi&s;ed, tho' not generally; and defended, as lawful, from the text gro&s;sly mi&s;under&s;tood, <HI>Joh.</HI> iii. 5. Upon the like gro&s;s mi&s;take of <HI>John</HI> vi. 53, they did, for many centuries, both in the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> church, communicate infants, and give them the Lord's &s;upper; and I do confe&s;s, &s;ays he, they might do both, as well as either.</Q></P>
<P>AND as there is no truth in repre&s;enting that the fir&s;t <HI>bapti&s;ts</HI> began at <HI>Mun&s;ter;</HI> &s;o, on a careful &s;earch, I find, that their character has been exceeding fal&s;ely repre&s;ented in our own nation. The chief accounts that the public have had of them, have been from their adver&s;aries, till about twenty-five years ago, Mr. <HI>Thomas Cro&s;by,</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> publi&s;hed a hi&s;tory of them, in four volumes. Therein he has &s;hewn, that about the time of the long parliament, Mr. <HI>John Tombes,</HI> Mr. <HI>Henry Je&s;&s;ey,</HI> Mr. <HI>Han&s;erd Knollys,</HI> Mr. <HI>Vava&s;or Powel,</HI> and many others, who had been educated at the univer&s;ities in <HI>England,</HI> and were as pious and &s;ucce&s;sful as almo&s;t any preachers in their day, em|braced the <HI>bapti&s;t</HI> principles, and &s;uffered a great deal therefor too, with a courage and patience equal
<PB N="12" REF="009587_0011_0F76DBB2018B85E8">
to any of the witne&s;&s;es for CHRIST in that day. And a great part of what they &s;uffered was from the <HI>Pre&s;|byterians,</HI> who when they had got the power into their own hands, wrote and acted &s;martly again&s;t to|lerating other &s;ects: to which Dr. <HI>Watts</HI> evidently refers, when he &s;ays,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orthodoxy and Charity, page 229.</NOTE> <Q>'Tis a pain and &s;hame to our eyes to look backward upon other times, and to behold pamphlets written again&s;t toleration, by &s;uch as are mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel of peace, that perfect law of liberty.

Accordingly he circum|ci&s;ed him&s;elf, his &s;on, and <HI>all the men</HI> of his hou&s;e; which, I conceive, con&s;tituted the old te&s;tament church. Well, in <HI>Jacob</HI>'s time, this church went into <HI>Egypt,</HI> where they endured a long &s;ea&s;on of bondage, 'till by an almighty hand they were delivered; and then the <HI>pa&s;&s;over</HI> was in&s;tituted, and the rules con|cerning it were very expre&s;s, that <HI>no uncircumci&s;ed per|&s;on &s;hould eat thereof: but every man's &s;ervant that was bought for money, when</HI> he was circumci&s;ed, <HI>then &s;hould he eat thereof: all the congregation of I&s;rael &s;hould keep it.</HI> Exod. xii. 43&mdash;48.

In this, I conceive, is di&s;covered the plain rea&s;on why <HI>Abraham</HI> was directed to circumci&s;e his &s;eed at <HI>eight days old,</HI> and not before; even becau&s;e he who knew all his works and de&s;igns from the beginning, knew what precepts and directions he de&s;igned to give to that church, to &s;hew who were clean, and who not: and therefore he ordered it &s;o, that none might be circumci&s;ed till they were clean.

<P>EXACTLY agreeable hereto, is the language of the <HI>me&s;&s;enger</HI> that came to <HI>prepare the way</HI> of our LORD; for when he &s;aw many of the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> and <HI>Sadducees</HI> come to his <HI>bapti&s;m,</HI> he &s;aid unto them, <HI>O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?

<P>THIS is further confirm'd by <HI>Matt.</HI> xviii. where you &s;ay, "CHRIST e&s;teemed <HI>tho&s;e little ones</HI> as be|lievers, vi&s;ibly &s;o;" as if all the little children of profe&s;&s;ors were e&s;teemed believers: tho' what the evangeli&s;t &s;ays, is, that <HI>Je&s;us called a little child unto him, and &s;et him in the mid&s;t,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;and he &s;aid, <HI>Who|&s;oever therefore &s;hall humble him&s;elf as</HI> THIS <HI>little child, the &s;ame is greate&s;t in the kingdom of heaven.</HI> Ver. 2, 4.

The <HI>other</HI> is, that JESUS &s;ays of <HI>the&s;e little ones</HI> which believe in him, that, <HI>in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my father.</HI> Ver. 10. Now the angels are <HI>&s;ent forth to mini&s;ter for the heirs of &s;alvation.</HI> All which proves plain enough, that we ought earne&s;tly to labour, to &s;hew to children the nece&s;&s;ity of believ|ing in CHRIST, and that many little ones do believe in him: but 'tis &s;o far from proving that CHRIST e&s;teem'd all the natural offspring of his people to be believers, that I really think &s;uch a notion is both fal&s;e and dangerous.</P>
<P>AND if we come to the commi&s;&s;ion, in <HI>Matt.</HI> xxviii. 19. our tran&s;lation &s;ays, <HI>Go, teach all nations, baptizing them.</HI> Mr. <HI>Dickin&s;on</HI> renders it, <HI>di&s;ciple all nations,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Dodderidge, pro&s;elyte all nations;</HI> either of which plainly carries in it, that there is a work to be done to the &s;ubjects, before they are baptized: namely, that they are fir&s;t to be <HI>taught,</HI> to be made <HI>di&s;ciples,</HI> or <HI>pro&s;elytes;</HI> (&s;ee <HI>Joh.</HI> iv. 1.) which is abundantly con|firmed by the evangeli&s;t <HI>Mark,</HI> chap. xvi. 15, 16. <HI>Go ye into all the world, and preach the go&s;pel to every crea|ture: he that believeth and is baptized, &s;hall be &s;aved.</HI> What can be plainer than this is? that CHRIST'S or|ders are to preach the go&s;pel to all nations, and that he that believeth it, and &s;o becomes his di&s;ciple, is to be baptized: but not the lea&s;t word of direction to bap|tize any other. And as little warrant (I believe) can be found from the apo&s;tles practice: for when the three thou&s;and were pricked in their hearts, and cried, <HI>What &s;hall we do? Peter &s;aid unto them, repent, and be baptized every one of you, in the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, and ye &s;hall receive the gift of the Holy Gho&s;t: for the promi&s;e is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God &s;hall call.</HI> Acts ii. 37&mdash;39.</P>

'Tis exceeding natural for us to think that all who hold &s;entiments different from ours, are influenced by bad motives: but this we are cautioned again&s;t, becau&s;e none but GOD can <HI>make manife&s;t the coun&s;els of the heart.</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> iv. v. And all breaches of the&s;e rules, I de&s;ire to condemn and renounce in my&s;elf and all others.</P>
<P>AND I would intreat you, Sir, to review your cen&s;ure again&s;t us, and &s;ee if they can &s;tand with the&s;e rules. Particularly, that charge, that we are <Q>going in the way of <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Core,</HI> in departing from GOD'S in&s;titutions, and without any &s;criptu|ral warrant, &s;etting up &s;eparately our&s;elves.</Q> Now in order for a ju&s;t view of the ca&s;e, it may be needful to give a brief narrative of facts relating to this affair.</P>
<P>LET it then be remembered, that before that ble&s;&s;ed revival of religion, which happened about twenty-three years ago, it was generally allowed there had been a great declen&s;ion in the churches of <HI>New-England.</HI> Well, in that revival, great numbers flocked into the churches; of which I was one, tho' not without great &s;truggles of mind, becau&s;e I thought the go&s;pel rules about admitting and di&s;ciplining of church members, were not &s;o &s;trictly ob&s;erved as they ought to have been; yet, as I &s;aw no other way to enjoy the precious ordinance of the LORD'S &s;upper, I joined with your church; where I continued more than two years, hoping for a reformation; but in&s;tead
<PB N="33" REF="009587_0032_0F76DBC2C1F5E848">
of that, the cu&s;tom was continued of letting &s;uch as did not pretend to be converted, bring their children to bapti&s;m; and of receiving members upon written relations of experiences into the church, which I ever thought to be an un&s;criptural way; 'till from that, you obtained a vote to admit per&s;ons without any relation at all, if they did not &s;ee cau&s;e to give any. And the church, which was a <HI>garden inclo&s;ed,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Cant.</HI> iv. 12.</NOTE> &s;eemed to be laid as an open field; and when a re|formation was urged, many would bring the parable of the <HI>tares</HI> again&s;t it. And that <HI>field,</HI> which CHRIST &s;ays is the <HI>world,</HI> was often declared to be the church, and that the <HI>good &s;eed</HI> and the <HI>tares</HI> mu&s;t grow toge|ther therein till harve&s;t.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>John Cotton,</HI> preached a &s;ermon at <HI>Attleborough,</HI> in <HI>January</HI> 1747, again&s;t the &s;eparation, and printed it; throughout which, he improves the parable in that line.</NOTE> I may here ob&s;erve, it was after the <HI>good &s;eed</HI> and <HI>tares</HI> both <HI>appeared</HI> by their <HI>fruit,</HI> that the &s;ervants were forbidden to gather up the tares: &s;o that if the <HI>field</HI> was the church, then tho&s;e that <HI>appeared</HI> by their <HI>fruit</HI> to be <HI>children of the wicked one,</HI> mu&s;t be let alone therein, till the end of the world. <HI>Matt.</HI> xiii. 26, 29, 38, 39. Another thing I'll mention here, and that is, that tho' liberty for chri&s;tians to improve their gifts, was allowed for a while, and it was owned that much good was done thereby; yet afterwards an outcry was made of their invading the mini&s;terial office, and the pulpits &s;ounded with warnings again&s;t <HI>lay exhorters,</HI> (as they were plea|&s;ed to call them) and &s;undry mini&s;ters who had been greatly engaged in the work of GOD, turned and joined with others that had called it a delu&s;ion of the Devil, and united all their force to cru&s;h the&s;e <HI>exhort|ers:</HI> and the public were cautioned again&s;t admitting any into the mini&s;try, but &s;uch as <HI>man had taught</HI> for that purpo&s;e <HI>from their youth;</HI> yea, tho' they might

<P>THESE, Sir, were certain facts; and mo&s;t of them known to your&s;elf:&mdash;and tho' I am far from ju&s;tify|ing every &s;tep of our conduct, in the manner of our withdrawing, or &s;ince; yet the principal grounds of our withdraw, I believe, were ju&s;t. <HI>The way of Cain,</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="009587_0034_0F76DBC3DE9EA368">
according to your own explanation, was <Q>a depart|ing from GOD'S in&s;titution, and devi&s;ing one of his own, which he offered without faith.</Q> Well, here was our very difficulty, you would admit tho&s;e to offer their children to bapti&s;m, that did not pretend to have <HI>Abel</HI>'s faith, and opened a door for others to come to the LORD'S table, without giving the church any account that they had that faith, and in the&s;e, and &s;ome other things, you had warped off from the ori|gininal con&s;titution of the church; therefore we with|drew from you, holding near or quite to it's fir&s;t principles: and to this day, I may boldly &s;ay, that our &s;ocieties in general, hold as fully to the doctri|nal articles of your church, as any in the land; and the only rea&s;on of my leaving infant bapti&s;m &s;ince, was becau&s;e I found it wanted "the &s;tamp of divine in&s;titution upon it." And I might &s;ay the &s;ame, as to the mode of &s;prinkling: for the numerous and plain accounts we have of their baptizing in <HI>rivers,</HI> and where there was <HI>much water,</HI> and of their going <HI>into,</HI> and coming <HI>out of the water,</HI> together with it's being twice called a <HI>burial,</HI> fully &s;atisfied me that CHRIST and his apo&s;tles were baptized by immer&s;ion: and the arguments of &s;ome to the contrary, appeared to me but weak; and &s;o they have to many <HI>paedo|bapti&s;t</HI> writers too. Dr. <HI>Wall,</HI> who took great pains to prove infants to be &s;ubjects; yet, as to the ancient mode, &s;ays, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tory of infant bapti&s;m, vol. II. page 291. Vide <HI>Cro&s;by</HI>'s hi&s;tory, vol. I. preface, page 6.</NOTE> <Q>Their general and ordinary way was, to baptize by immer&s;ion, or dipping the per|&s;on, whether it were infant, or grown man or wo|man, into the water. This, adds he, is &s;o plain and clear, by an infinite number of pa&s;&s;ages, that as one cannot but pity the weak endeavours of &s;uch <HI>paedobapti&s;ts</HI> as would maintain the negative

of it; &s;o al&s;o we ought to di&s;own, and &s;hew a di&s;|like of the prophane &s;coffs which &s;ome people give to the <HI>Engli&s;h antipaedobapti&s;ts,</HI> merely for their u&s;ing dipping. 'Tis one thing to maintain, that that circum&s;tance is not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the e&s;&s;ence of bapti&s;m; and another to go about to repre&s;ent it as ridiculous and fooli&s;h, or as &s;hame|ful and indecent; when it was in all probability the way by which our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, and for cer|tain was the mo&s;t u&s;ual and ordinary way by which the ancient chri&s;tians did receive their bapti&s;m.</Q> So that the way it &s;eems he has to &s;upport &s;prinkling, is by &s;uppo&s;ing it not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to keep to the ancient mode in that ordinance. But tho' after <HI>I&s;rael</HI> had got fine hou&s;es to dwell in, they likely thought they could keep the fea&s;t of tabernacles well enough in them, and not take the pains to build <HI>booths;</HI> yet, when their hou&s;es had lain de&s;olate &s;eventy years, tho&s;e which returned from captivity found it duty to return to the ancient pattern. (<HI>Lev.</HI> xxiii. 42. <HI>Nehem.</HI> viii. 14&mdash;18.) And &s;o I believe GOD'S people will in this ca&s;e, &s;ooner or later. But to re|turn from this digre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>INSTEAD of our departing from GOD'S in&s;tituti|ons, the very cau&s;e of our departing from you, was becau&s;e of your holding the&s;e things, which we could not find the &s;tamp of his in&s;titution upon: from whence I leave others to judge, who mo&s;t re&s;emble <HI>Cain,</HI> in treating their brethren as he did his brother. Concerning <HI>Core</HI>'s <HI>company,</HI> we read, that they were <HI>famous in the congregation, men of renown:</HI> and they <HI>gain&s;ayed Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> whom GOD had called to teach and lead his <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and they &s;aid, <HI>Ye take too much upon you, &s;eeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them&mdash;wherefore then lift you up your&s;elves,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Numb.</HI> xvi. 2, 3. Now, who are they in our day that &s;ay, all the congregation are holy, and that their voice

in calling mini&s;ters, is the voice of GOD? So far are tho&s;e who e&s;pou&s;e an internal call by the divine &s;pirit, from lifting them&s;elves up in this matter, that, I pre&s;ume, they could freely &s;ay as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> did before this, <HI>Would God that all the Lord's people were pro|phets, and that</HI> he <HI>would put his &s;pirit upon them.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Numb.</HI> xi. 29.</NOTE> But we dare not &s;ay, that being taught and called of men, without that &s;pirit, can make them true mini&s;|ters of CHRIST.

And tho&s;e that &s;till go on in tho&s;e churches, which rulers, mini&s;ters and people have often declared, would not &s;tand if it were not for the &s;upport of the civil authority, we leave in the hand of GOD, praying that he would in his own time, <HI>de&s;troy the face of covering ca&s;t over all people;</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>I&s;a.</HI> xxv. 7.</NOTE> and cau&s;e his light and truth to prevail every where.</P>
<P>AND to conclude;&mdash;what I aimed at in this letter, was, not a di&s;pute upon every branch of the&s;e con|trover&s;ies; that has been often done already: but to endeavour to &s;hew the inju&s;tice of the reproaches which you have ca&s;t upon us, and upon the truth, thro' us; and to open a little of the true &s;tate of the ca&s;e between us; and thro' the whole, to &s;hew all proper re&s;pect to mens per&s;ons, and yet to &s;peak the truth plainly, according to the be&s;t of my under&s;tand|ing. How far I have accompli&s;hed what I aim'd at, others mu&s;t judge: and if you, Sir, or any others, can convince me, in a friendly way, of any mi&s;take, I hope I &s;hall take it kindly; tho' I am not to be

<P>SINCE I fini&s;hed the foregoing letter, I have thought &s;o much of one thing, that I concluded to add a little upon it here; and that is, your &s;aying, <Q>Do not the late &s;eparations already di&s;cover their nature by their fruits; in that &s;ome have by this time apo&s;tatized even from all religion:&mdash;while &s;ome others are renouncing infant bapti&s;m, and going fa&s;t to the like dreadful apo&s;tacy?</Q> Now, Sir, unle&s;s you could have &s;hewn, that renouncing the notion of bringing per&s;ons into the church and into the mini&s;try, by natural generation, and human in&s;truction and influence; and holding to the nece&s;|&s;ity of regeneration, and divine teachings and influ|ence in order thereto; (which are the central points of the controver&s;y) I &s;ay, unle&s;s you could have &s;hewn that the&s;e principles had a natural tendency to apo&s;tacy, there is not a whit more of ju&s;tice in this cen&s;ure, becau&s;e of the unhappy conduct of &s;ome that have been among us, than there would be for a per&s;on that was prejudiced again&s;t your denomination, to &s;ay, <Q>Do not the&s;e mini&s;ters di&s;cover what they are by their fruits; in that &s;ome of them have already been proved to be whore-mongers and drunkards,
<PB N="39" REF="009587_0038_0F76DBC7976BE150">
and others are going fa&s;t in the &s;ame way?</Q> But where is the per&s;on or people under heaven that would be willing to be judged by &s;uch a rule? &s;urely there is none. And whether we believe it or no, yet all will be made to know, &s;ooner or later, that, <HI>with what judgment ye judge, ye &s;hall be judged: and with what mea&s;ure ye mete, it &s;hall be mea&s;ured to you again.</HI> Matt. vii. 2. Which words, if rightly view'd, would be enough to deter every one from condemning any for their neighbours evils, which they abhor.</P>
<P>THE truth is, that notwit&s;tanding our many mi&s;|takes and wanderings, (for which we have great cau&s;e to be humbled before GOD) yet, in&s;tead of <HI>apo&s;tacy,</HI> there has been a great <HI>revival</HI> of religion within the&s;e two or three years, among the&s;e people that you bear &s;o hard again&s;t, in many parts of the land. I know that two years ago, after &s;uch a revival in the north|ea&s;t part of your town, one that joins with you in ranking &s;uch in&s;truments as were u&s;ed in that work, with <HI>Core and his company,</HI> declared there, publicly, that, <Q>In times of general &s;ecurity, Satan finds it to his advantage to &s;tir up per&s;ons to fal&s;e zeal, and &s;eeming religion,</Q> and that <Q>he can and does of|ten affright many, filling them with terror and fears of hell.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Whitaker</HI>'s &s;ermon on the Trial of the Spirits, preach'd <HI>March</HI> 17, 1762, page 4.&mdash;<HI>N. B.</HI> When &s;ouls are awakened, Satan often fills them with fears that heaven will not receive them, and &s;o would drive them to hell; but that he &s;tirs up the &s;ecure, and fills them with fears of hell, I believe is far from being true.</NOTE></Q> And when he comes to lay down <HI>marks</HI> to <HI>try the &s;pirits</HI> by, he &s;ays, <Q>I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to &s;uch marks and characters, which, as I appre|hend, be&s;t &s;uit with tho&s;e appearances of Satan in the garb of an angel of light, which of late years he has a&s;&s;umed.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 14.</NOTE></Q> Which plainly in&s;inuates that the work which had then been among the &s;eparati&s;ts
<PB N="40" REF="009587_0039_0F76DBC85CA1C5E0">
in that place, was a delu&s;ion of Satan: yet after all his in&s;inuations, take the very marks which he lays down, according to the plain language of &s;cripture, without turning them into allegory, (as he &s;ays many do) <HI>viz.</HI> That the true &s;pirit fir&s;t brings light to the under&s;tanding, &s;hewing to per&s;ons by the truths re|vealed in the word, the moral evil of their hearts and lives, and the abominable nature of &s;in as committed again&s;t GOD, till they find them&s;elves utterly unable to obey the law aright in one point or tittle. And that it leads men to tru&s;t in CHRIST as he is exhi|bited in the word, and to re&s;t upon him there. That it empties men, and makes them become as <HI>little children, teachable</HI> and <HI>humble,</HI> yea, and charitable al&s;o to others. And la&s;tly, that the true &s;pirit teacheth us, that religion con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in <HI>practice,</HI> i. e. in <HI>holy actions,</HI> ari&s;ing from <HI>holy tempers,</HI> and <HI>divine exer|ci&s;es of the heart.</HI> I &s;ay, according to the&s;e marks which he lays down, there is abundant rea&s;on to be|lieve that there has been a glorious reformation, and &s;everal hundred &s;ouls turned from &s;in to GOD, in many parts of <HI>New-England,</HI> within the&s;e two or three years; and a very great part of it among tho&s;e which you re|pre&s;ent as going in the way of apo&s;tacy. Yea, and &s;uch a glorious work is now going on in your own place, which I hope will be a means to convince you, Sir, and others, of their wrong charges again&s;t us.</P>
