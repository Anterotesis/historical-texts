<P>&rindx; AT a time when public credit is &s;unk very low, and our highe&s;t Rulers are loudly complained of, all men among us may ju&s;tly be alarmed; for a Government divided again&s;t it&s;elf, is brought to de&s;o|lation; and every city or hou&s;e divided again&s;t it&s;elf, &s;hall not &s;tand.

<P>Even &s;o hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach the Go&s;pel, &s;hould live of the Go&s;pel.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS is as plain an ordinance of God as any he ever in&s;tituted; and it is as di&s;|tinct from the ordinances of men, as heaven is from earth. The ordinances of men, enforced by the &s;word, are to defend the per&s;ons and property of all impartially, and to puni&s;h &s;uch as work ill to their neighbours; but the ordi|nances of the go&s;pel are for begetting and pro|moting faith and love in the &s;ouls of men, &s;o as to act towards God and their neighbours from heavenly motives. Therefore pure religion is an infinite ble&s;&s;ing to mankind; and fal&s;e pretences to it, produce infinite mi&s;chiefs. This hath been experienced in all ages, and in all countries. Fear and love are the great principles of human actions; but they were divided by the fall, and the devil hath held men in bondage through fear of death. And nothing can unite the&s;e two principles, but faith in the death and merits of Chri&s;t, our great high prie&s;t and king in heaven. His kingdom is not of this world, and therefore the world have no right to u&s;e force about his mini&s;ters. This will more fully appear, if we con&s;ider what the go&s;pel is, who are the true preachers of it, and what is intended by living of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="4" REF="022322_0004_0FB7FB2268E74870">
1. What is the go&s;pel? It is a pure revela|tion from God, of &s;alvation through his Son, by the power of the Holy Gho&s;t. It is by the &s;eed of the woman, who hath brui&s;ed the &s;erpent's head. Truth and love form the character of Chri&s;t and his children; and deceit and cruelty form the character of the devil and his children; and God hath put <HI>enmity</HI> between them. Gen. iii. 15. This appeared in the old world between Cain and Abel; and between the &s;eed of Cain and the &s;eed of Seth. After the flood the church de&s;cended in the line of Shem, until Abraham was called out of Chal|dea, and received the promi&s;e of the de&s;cent of the church in his &s;eed, until Chri&s;t came, in whom all the families of the earth &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed. And when he received the <HI>bloody</HI> &s;ign of circum|ci&s;ion, it was a <HI>&s;eal</HI> to him of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the faith which he before had in Chri&s;t, who was delivered for our offences, and was rai&s;ed again for our ju&s;tification. Rom. iv. 11 &mdash;23. Gal. iii. 10&mdash;22. Circumci&s;ion was a type of the death of Chri&s;t, and of a change of heart by his word and &s;pirit. Therefore he &s;aid of the remnant who are &s;aved, The Lord thy God will circumci&s;e thine heart, and the heart of thy &s;eed, to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart and with all thy &s;oul, that thou may&s;t live.&mdash;The word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou may&s;t do it. And an in&s;pired apo&s;tle &s;ays, That is the word of faith which we preach, that if thou &s;halt confe&s;s with thy mouth the Lord Je&s;us, and &s;halt believe in thine heart, that God hath rai&s;ed him from the dead, thou &s;halt be &s;aved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteou&s;|ne&s;s, and with the mouth confe&s;&s;ion is made unto &s;alvation. Deut. xxx. 6&mdash;14. Rom. x. 6&mdash;10.
<PB N="5" REF="022322_0005_0FB7FB2389671AC0">Abraham had no right to circumci&s;e any per&s;on that was not born in his hou&s;e, until he had bought him as &s;ervant with money; and he was an emi|nent type of the Son of God, who purcha&s;ed the church with his own blood. Therefore the go&s;|pel &s;ays, Awake, awake, put on &s;trength, O Zion, put on thy beautiful garments, O Jeru&s;alem the holy city; for henceforth there &s;hall no more come into thee the uncircumci&s;ed and the unclean.&mdash; Shake thy&s;elf from the du&s;t; ari&s;e, and &s;it down, O Jeru&s;alem: loo&s;e thy&s;elf from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion: for thus &s;aith the Lord, Ye have &s;old your&s;elves for nought, and ye &s;hall be redeemed without money. How beauti|ful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publi&s;heth peace, that bringeth good tidings of good, that publi&s;heth &s;al|vation, that &s;aith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth? Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. I&s;aiah lii. 1&mdash;3, 7. Rom. x. 15&mdash;17. And without controver&s;y, great is the my&s;tery of godline&s;s; God was manife&s;t in the fle&s;h, ju&s;tified in the Spirit, &s;een of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory. Bodily exerci&s;e profiteth little; but god|line&s;s is profitable unto all things, having pro|mi&s;e of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. 1 Tim. iii. 16. iv. 8. Every one that doth evil, hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, le&s;t his deeds &s;hould be reproved. But he that doth truth, cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manife&s;t, that they are wrought in God. John iii. 20, 21. The go&s;pel is a pure re|velation from God, which the angels &s;aw more of when God was manife&s;t in the fle&s;h, than they ever did before; and the promi&s;es of grace belong
<PB N="6" REF="022322_0006_0FB7FB25E8B40370">only to tho&s;e who believe in and obey the Son of God. We come therefore to inquire,</P>
<P N="2">II. Who are the true preachers of the go&s;pel. In the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, they are all <HI>taught of God,</HI> with|out which no man can come to his Son. John vi. 44, 45. When he came as the light of the world, none received him but they who were <HI>born, not of blood, nor of the will of the fle&s;h, nor of the will of man, but of God.</HI> John i. 9&mdash;14. No man can &s;ay that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the Lord, but by the Holy Gho&s;t. 1 Cor. xii. 3. If any man have not the <HI>Spirit of Chri&s;t</HI> he is none of his. Rom. viii. 9. Without it he is not a Chri&s;tian, but a blind leader of the blind. He who hath not a &s;ingle eye to God, to learn and do his will, is full of darkne&s;s. Matt. vi. 21&mdash;23. An evil bias blinds the eyes of the wi&s;e, and perverts the words of the righte|ous; and how much more the unrighteous, who were never born again? In the <HI>&s;econd</HI> place, all true mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, receive &s;pecial gifts from him, for the great work to which they are called. A good natural capacity for teaching, and human learning and accompli&s;hments; e&s;pecially a good acquaintance with language, and with the be&s;t methods of conveying our ideas to others, are of great importance in the&s;e affairs. Yet all the&s;e, without an hone&s;t heart, enable men to do the more mi&s;chief, both in the world, and in the church of God. Therefore we read of the &s;light of men, and cunning craftine&s;s, whereby they lie in wait to deceive, in the &s;ame chapter which a&s;|&s;ures us, that our a&s;cended Lord gives gifts for pa&s;tors and teachers, who <HI>&s;peak the truth in love.</HI> Eph. iv. 11&mdash;16. In the <HI>third</HI> place, the apo&s;tle Peter &s;ays, As every man hath received the gift, even &s;o mini&s;ter the &s;ame one to another, as good
<PB N="7" REF="022322_0007_0FB7FB2B0597A7E8">&s;tewards of the manifold grace of God. If any man &s;peak, let him &s;peak as the oracles of God; if any man mini&s;ter, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth; that God in all things may be glorified through Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The elders which are among you I exhort, who am al&s;o an elder, and a witne&s;s of the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t, and al&s;o a partaker of the glory that &s;hall be revealed; feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the over&s;ight thereof, not by con&s;traint, but will|ingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being en&s;amples to the flock. And when the chief Shepherd &s;hall appear, ye &s;hall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away. Likewi&s;e ye younger, &s;ubmit your&s;elves unto the elder: yea, all of you be &s;ubject one to another, and be clothed with humility; for God re&s;i&s;teth the proud, and giveth grace unto the humble. 1 Peter iv. 10, 11. v. 1&mdash;5. Here we may &s;ee, that all true mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, are regenerate per&s;ons, and have re|ceived &s;pecial gifts from him for that work, with a command to be faithful &s;tewards thereof, as they can an&s;wer it to him in the great day. They are leaders in the church, who are all to act as a unit|ed community, and to be &s;ubject one to another, as they would expect the <HI>grace</HI> of God to direct and a&s;&s;i&s;t them, and not to be <HI>re&s;i&s;ted</HI> by him, as all the <HI>proud</HI> are. The name <HI>Clergy,</HI> which min|i&s;ters have arrogated to them&s;elves, came from the word which is here tran&s;lated <HI>heritage;</HI> and mini&s;ters have acted as <HI>lords</HI> over God's heritage, by a&s;&s;uming the power of church government unto them&s;elves, as the prie&s;ts had under the law, who could turn a king out of the temple. 2 Chron. xxvi. 18. And in this way the mother of harlots
<PB N="8" REF="022322_0008_0FB7FB2FC52E7E08">hath reigned over the kings of the earth. Rev. xvii. 18. She hath a&s;&s;umed the power of di&s;po&s;|ing of crowns and countries at her plea&s;ure, while &s;he hath claimed a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of church power from the apo&s;tles, which none but mini&s;ters could give or take away. America hath been divided, and filled with blood and &s;lavery, from that helli&s;h claim of power. But the Apo&s;tle Peter was &s;o far from claiming any &s;uch power, that he allows none to be <HI>prie&s;ts</HI> in the church of Chri&s;t, but tho&s;e who are <HI>born again, not of corruptible &s;eed, but incorrupt|ible, by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever.</HI> And to this royal prie&s;thood, and holy nation, he &s;ays, <HI>Submit your&s;elves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's &s;ake.</HI> 1 Peter i. 23. ii. 9&mdash;13. But when men invaded the prerogative of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, he and John &s;aid, <HI>Whether it be right in the &s;ight of God, to hearken unto you, more than unto God, judge ye: for we cannot but &s;peak the things which we have &s;een and heard.</HI> Acts iv. 19, 20. And John &s;ays, <HI>Who&s;oever is born of God, doth not commit &s;in, for his &s;eed remaineth in him; and he cannot &s;in, becau&s;e he is born of God. In this the children of God are manife&s;t, and the children of the devil.</HI> 1 John, iii. 9, 10. And when our Lord &s;ent his go&s;pel into the wide field of the world, he commanded his &s;ervants to let the&s;e two &s;orts of chil|dren grow together therein, until he &s;hould come to judgment, and ca&s;t the wicked into hell, and take his &s;aints to heaven. Matt. xiii. 24&mdash;30, 37&mdash;43. While he requires his church to exclude all men who are fornicators, or covetous, or idola|ters, or railers, or drunkards, or extortioners, from their communion. Purging out the&s;e evils, is the antitype of putting away all <HI>leavened bread</HI> out of their hou&s;es, in the time of the pa&s;&s;over. 1 Cor. v.
<PB N="9" REF="022322_0009_0FB7FB354E53B598">7&mdash;13. But by <HI>confounding</HI> church and world to|gether, the holy government which Chri&s;t ap|pointed in his church, hath been long trodden un|der foot. This will more plainly appear, if we con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="3">III. What is intended by living of the go&s;pel. As Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the only HEAD of his church, all the ordinances and commandments of men therein, is <HI>will-wor&s;hip.</HI> And his command to his church is, What&s;oever ye do, in word or deed, do all <HI>in the name of the Lord Je&s;us,</HI> giving thanks to God and the Father by him. Col. ii. 10, 19&mdash;23. iii. 17. Covetous men, who privily brought in damnable here&s;ies, were <HI>&s;elf-willed,</HI> under the name of <HI>liberty.</HI> 2 Peter, ii. 1&mdash;3, 10, 19. They &s;inned <HI>wilfully</HI> again&s;t the laws, blood and &s;pirit of Chri&s;t. Heb. x. 26&mdash;29. And all &s;uch u&s;e <HI>force</HI> to &s;upport religious teachers, or el&s;e they refu&s;e to &s;upport them any further than &s;uits their inclina|tions. Men who love &s;elf above God and their neighbours, heap to them&s;elves teachers, having itching ears; and they turn away their ears from the truth, and are turned unto fables. 2 Tim. iii. 1&mdash;5, iv. 1&mdash;4. But God &s;aid unto Aaron, Thou and thy &s;ons with thee &s;hall keep your prie&s;t's of|fice for every thing of the altar, and within the vail, and ye &s;hall &s;erve: I have given your prie&s;t's office unto you as a &s;ervice of gift; and the &s;tranger that cometh nigh, &s;hall be put to death. And the Lord &s;pake unto Aaron, Behold, I al&s;o have given thee the charge of mine heave-offerings, of all the hallowed things of the children of I&s;rael; unto thee have I given them, by rea&s;on of the <HI>anointing,</HI> and to thy &s;ons by an ordinance forever. Numb. xviii. 7, 8. The ointment with which they were anointed, was of &s;uch a &s;acred compo&s;ition, that
<PB N="10" REF="022322_0010_0FB7FB3646F4BB30">God &s;aid, Who&s;oever &s;hall make like unto that, to &s;mell thereto, &s;hall even be cut off from his people, Exod. xxx. 38. But the holy Spirit, wherewith Chri&s;t and his &s;aints are <HI>anointed,</HI> is infinitely more &s;acred. It brings &s;ouls to know the <HI>truth,</HI> and that <HI>no lie is of the truth.</HI> All <HI>deceit</HI> is of the <HI>&s;pirit of antichri&s;t.</HI> 1 John, ii. 20&mdash;27. And if it were not for that &s;pirit, the laws of Chri&s;t would be plain, which &s;ay, Do ye not know that they which mini&s;ter about holy things, live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar, are partakers with the altar? Even &s;o hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach the go&s;pel &s;hould live of the go&s;pel. Ye have been called unto li|berty; only u&s;e not liberty for an occa&s;ion to the fle&s;h, but by love &s;erve one another. They that are Chri&s;t's, have crucified the fle&s;h, with the af|fections and lu&s;ts. Bear ye one another's burdens, and &s;o fulfil the law of Chri&s;t. Let him that is taught in the word, communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things. Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for what&s;oever a man &s;ow|eth, that &s;hall he al&s;o reap. For he that &s;oweth to his fle&s;h, &s;hall of the fle&s;h reap corruption; but he that &s;oweth to the Spirit, &s;hall of the Spirit reap life everla&s;ting. Gal. v. 13, 24, vi. 2&mdash;8. Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, e&s;pecially they who labour in the word and doctrine; for the &s;cripture &s;aith, Thou &s;hall not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn; and the labourer is worthy of his reward. 1 Tim. v. 17, 18.</P>
<P>As the go&s;pel is a pure revelation from God, living of the go&s;pel cannot mean a living by the laws of men, enforced by the &s;word. Neither can it mean, that the bodies of mini&s;ters &s;hould live
<PB N="11" REF="022322_0011_0FB7FB37DA579760">upon &s;piritual food. To communicate unto them in all <HI>good things,</HI> cannot mean only <HI>good words and fair &s;peeches,</HI> neither can a <HI>reward</HI> for <HI>labour,</HI> mean <HI>alms to the poor.</HI> Yet the world is full of the&s;e ab&s;urd imaginations. Teaching the fear of God by the precepts of men, hath made them deaf and blind to the voice and light of revelation. But the day is coming, when he &s;ays, The deaf &s;hall hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind &s;hall &s;ee cut of ob&s;curity, and out of dark|ne&s;s; the meek al&s;o &s;hall increa&s;e their joy in the Lord, and the poor among men &s;hall rejoice in the holy One of I&s;rael: for the terrible one is brought to nought, and the &s;corner is con&s;umed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off; that make a man an offender for a word, and lay a &s;nare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn a&s;ide the ju&s;t for a thing of nought. I&s;aiah xxix. 13&mdash;21. This prophecy was verified when Chri&s;t came in the fle&s;h. Mat. xi. 6, xv. 7&mdash;9. And it will have a much more glorious accompli&s;hment, when he &s;hall reign with his &s;aints upon earth. But the glory of that reign is de&s;cribed in &s;uch bright figures, that many put it beyond the re&s;urrection of the body. Though, as the coming of Elijah meant the coming of John the Bapti&s;t, in the <HI>&s;pirit and power of Elias,</HI> &s;o I believe that the re&s;urrec|tion of the <HI>&s;ouls</HI> of the old martyrs, means the rai&s;ing of their <HI>&s;pirit and power</HI> in the churches, who would yield to <HI>death,</HI> rather than neglect obe|dience to the <HI>commandments</HI> of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Mal. iv. 6. Luke i. 17. Rev. xii. 11, 17. xx. 4&mdash;6. The <HI>words</HI> of &s;cripture ought ever to be regarded, <HI>comparing &s;piritual things with &s;piritual.</HI> 1 Cor. ii. 13. But <HI>confounding</HI> natural and &s;piritual things together, erected my&s;tery Babylon. The Son of
<PB N="12" REF="022322_0012_0FB7FB3953DF95E0">God was within the Jewi&s;h church, when he warn|ed her leaders again&s;t looking el&s;ewhere for his Kingdom; but he is now at the right hand of the Father, making his people willing by the power of his go&s;pel; and he will &s;trike through kings in the day of his wrath, and wound the heads over many countries. Luke xvii. 21. Acts ii. 29&mdash;39. P&s;alm cx. 1&mdash;6. Rev. xix. 11&mdash;21. But from the word <HI>within,</HI> many have imagined that they were to fol|low a rule <HI>within</HI> them&s;elves, above what is writ|ten. Scornful men of old &s;aid, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agree|ment; when the overflowing &s;courge &s;hall pa&s;s through, it &s;hall not come unto us; for we have made lies our refuge, and under fal&s;ehood have we hid our&s;elves. I&s;aiah xviii. 14&mdash;16. To be car|nally minded is death, and deceit came from hell; and all men who think to &s;ecure them&s;elves by their own doings, are in covenant with death, and at agreement with hell. I&s;rael followed after the law of righteou&s;ne&s;s, but did not attain to it, be|cau&s;e they &s;ought it not by faith, but as it were by the deeds of the law; for they &s;tumbled at that &s;tumbling-&s;tone, as it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a &s;tumbling-&s;tone, and rock of offence: and who&s;oever believeth on him, &s;hall not be <HI>a&s;hamed.</HI> Rom. viii. 6&mdash;9.ix. 31&mdash;33. Hearing and doing the <HI>&s;ayings</HI> of Chri&s;t, is the only way for any to build upon the <HI>Rock.</HI> Mat. vii. 24. All others make lies their refuge. The death of Chri&s;t broke down the middle wall of partition between Jews and Gentiles; and &s;ays our apo&s;tle, Through him we both have acce&s;s by one Spirit unto the Father. Now therefore ye are no more &s;trangers and for|eigners, but fellow-citizens with the &s;aints, and of the <HI>hou&s;hold of God;</HI> and are built upon the foun|dation
<PB N="13" REF="022322_0013_0FB7FB3AC51E3610">of the <HI>apo&s;tles</HI> and <HI>prophets,</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf being the chief corner &s;tone; in whom all the building fitly framed together, groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord; in whom you al&s;o are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit. Eph. ii. 18&mdash;22.</P>
<P>The <HI>apo&s;tles</HI> are &s;et before the <HI>prophets,</HI> both in the fir&s;t building of the Chri&s;tian church, and al&s;o in her triumph over Babylon. Rev. xviii. 20.

<P>From Abraham unto the death of Chri&s;t, pecu|liar religious privileges were confined to certain families. Even the preaching of the go&s;pel was limited to the <HI>hou&s;e of I&s;rael,</HI> which is now free for <HI>all nations.</HI> Matt. x. 6. xxviii. 19.

Lot was a righteous man, as well as Abraham; but the I&s;raelites were not allowed to invade the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the children of Lot, nor to receive them into the church of God. Deut. ii. 17.&mdash;19. Num. xxiii. 9. The fir&s;t &s;on of Abra|ham was ca&s;t out of the church, for <HI>mocking</HI> at the joy of faith; and the unregenerate do the like to this day.

Ezek. xxi. 25&mdash;27. Luke i. 31&mdash;33. Rev. iii. 9. The Hebrew and Chri&s;tian churches, are the two candle&s;ticks, into which God poured the oil of his grace, by his pre|cepts to direct their way, and by his promi&s;es to &s;upport their &s;ouls, in holding up light to the world, who hate it, becau&s;e it torments their con|&s;ciences. The writings of Mo&s;es are the only records that any men have of the fir&s;t creation, of the primitive &s;tate of man, of his fall, and of the promi&s;es of grace to the fathers, from Adam to his time. And the law of Mo&s;es was given, to expo&s;e the nature and infinite evil of &s;in, and to point &s;in|ners to the Son of God, who only can &s;ave from the guilt and power of it. Therefore the in&s;pired apo&s;tle of the Gentiles &s;ays, The law entered, that the offence might abound; but where &s;in abound|ed, grace did much more abound: that as &s;in hath reigned unto death, even &s;o might grace reign through righteou&s;ne&s;s unto eternal life, by Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord. And to guard again&s;t the ima|gination,
<PB N="20" REF="022322_0020_0FB7FB4EC066A940">that free &s;alvation by grace, would en|courage men to continue in &s;in, he &s;aid, To whom ye yield your&s;elves &s;ervants to obey, his &s;ervants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of &s;in unto death, or of obedience unto righteou&s;ne&s;s. Rom. v. 20, 21. vi. 1, 16. Chri&s;t was made a <HI>cur&s;e</HI> for us, that we might <HI>receive the promi&s;e of the Spirit through faith.</HI> And all men are <HI>bewitched,</HI> who claim the <HI>promi&s;es of grace</HI> in any other way. Gal. iii. 1, 10&mdash;14. Yet after the power of the devil was broken in the Roman empire, by the power of the go&s;pel, men who were the &s;ervants of &s;in, a&s;&s;umed the place of the Son of God in his church, &s;o as to be lawgivers and judges for all in religious af|fairs. And as he takes all that is done to his word, and to his &s;aints, as done to him&s;elf, he &s;ays, He that de&s;pi&s;ed Mo&s;es' law, died without mercy, un|der two or three witne&s;&s;es: of how much &s;orer puni&s;hment, &s;uppo&s;e ye, &s;hall he be thought wor|thy, who hath <HI>trodden under foot the Son of God!</HI> Heb. x. 28, 29.

Rev. xi. 2&mdash;10. xiii. 5. And as <HI>Lord&s;hip</HI> is of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> but is excluded from the church of Chri&s;t, I take the <HI>holy city</HI> to mean the government of his church, which men have trampled upon. Mark x. 42, 43. In&s;tead of obeying the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;o that his grace might reign through righteou&s;ne&s;s, un|godly men turned his grace into la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s, in imitation of Cain, Balaam and Core. Jude 4&mdash;11. The way of Cain, was to wor&s;hip God without faith in the blood of the Lamb, and to kill Abel becau&s;e God accepted his believing wor&s;hip, and did not accept Cain's will wor&s;hip. Heb. xi. 4.
<PB N="21" REF="022322_0021_0FB7FB50876A3568">1 John iii. 7&mdash;12. The error of Balaam was lov|ing the world above God, and coun&s;elling a king to entice I&s;rael into &s;in, for an earthly reward. The Midianites who did it, were of the &s;eed of Abra|ham, as well as the I&s;raelites, but not of that church. A &s;word was held up before Balaam to warn him of his danger; and he was finally &s;lain with the &s;word. Gen. xxv. 2. Num. xxii. 31. xxiii. 9. xxxi. 8, 16. And Chri&s;t will &s;lay all, with the &s;word of his mouth, who love the wages of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, except they repent. 2 Peter ii. 15, 16. Rev. ii. 14&mdash;16. xix. 11&mdash;21. Korah rai&s;ed a rebellion in I&s;rael again&s;t the government which God had e&s;tab|li&s;hed therein, under Mo&s;es and Aaron, who were eminent types of Chri&s;t. Num. xvi. 1&mdash;3. For Mo&s;es truly &s;aid unto the fathers, A prophet &s;hall the Lord your God rai&s;e up unto you, of your bre|thren, like unto me; him &s;hall ye hear in all things what&s;oever he &s;hall &s;ay unto you. And it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, that every &s;oul which will not hear that prophet &s;hall be de&s;troyed from among the people. Acts iii. 22, 23. Mo&s;es verily was faith|ful in all his hou&s;e as a <HI>&s;ervant,</HI> for a te&s;timony of tho&s;e things which were to be &s;poken after; but Chri&s;t as a <HI>Son</HI> over his own hou&s;e; who&s;e hou&s;e are we, if we hold fa&s;t the confidence, and the re|joicing of the hope firm unto the end. And of the prie&s;thood, it is &s;aid, No man taketh this honor unto him&s;elf, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron: &s;o al&s;o, Chri&s;t glorified not him&s;elf, to be made an high prie&s;t; but he that &s;aid unto him, Thou art my Son, to-day have I begotten thee. As he &s;aith al&s;o in another place, Thou art a prie&s;t forever after the order of Melchi&s;edec. Heb. iii. 5, 6. v. 4&mdash;6.
