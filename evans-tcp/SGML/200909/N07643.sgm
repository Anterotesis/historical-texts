<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THE Importance of the liberal education of youth, both to church and &s;tate, and the nece&s;&s;ity of public &s;chools and colleges for that end, is now &s;o univer&s;ally acknow|ledged, as to render an enlargement upon it unnece&s;&s;ary, by way of introduction to the following account. The main de&s;ign of this publication, is to acquaint the world, with the ri&s;e, progre&s;s, and pre&s;ent &s;tate of the COLLEGE OF NEW-JERSEY, which for &s;ome Years pa&s;t, hath been an Object of public Attention.</P>
<P>THE great di&s;advantages, this, and the conti|guous provinces lay under, &s;ome years ago, for want of &s;uch an in&s;titution, are well known. The di&s;tance of the briti&s;h univer&s;ities, and the expences
<PB N="6" REF="009752_0004_0F7A47DE090D8528">
attending an education abroad, were, to the american coloni&s;ts, in&s;uperable ob&s;tacles. The two colleges of <HI>New-England,</HI> and that of <HI>Virginia,</HI> then the only &s;eats of learning, in the wide-extended briti&s;h empire in America, were too remote from each other, to extend their influence through the&s;e intermediate colonies. Hence, in point of litera|ture, a large tract of a well-peopled country, nece&s;&s;arily lay rude and uncultivated.</P>
<P>AS the colonies encrea&s;ed, the exigencies of affairs, both of an eccle&s;ia&s;tical and political nature, became more and more urgent. Religious &s;ocieties were annually formed, in various places; and had they long continued vacant, or been &s;upplied with an ignorant illiterate clergy, chri&s;tianity it&s;elf, in a cour&s;e of years, might have become extinct among them. Affairs of &s;tate al&s;o became more embarra&s;&s;ed for want of proper direction, and a competent number of men of letters, to fill the various political offices. The bench, the bar, and &s;eats of legi&s;lation, required &s;uch accompli&s;hments, as are &s;eldom the &s;pontaneous growth of nature, unimproved by education.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="009752_0005_0F7A47E04D3C7168">YET, even in this dark period, there were not wanting &s;everal gentlemen, both of the civil and &s;acred character, who, forming a ju&s;t e&s;timate of the importance of learning, exerted their utmo&s;t efforts, to plant and cheri&s;h it in the province of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey.</HI> After &s;ome di&s;appointments and fruitle&s;s attempts, application was at length made to his excellency <HI>Jonathan Belcher,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> at that time governor of the province, and, in the year 1748, he was plea&s;ed, with the approbation of his maje&s;ty's council, to grant a CHARTER, incorporating &s;undry gentlemen of the clergy and laity, to the number of twenty-three, as tru&s;tees; inve&s;ting them with &s;uch powers, as were requi&s;ite to carry the de&s;ign into execution, and con&s;tituting his maje&s;ty's governor for the time being, <HI>ex officio,</HI> their pre&s;ident.</P>
<P>THAT the con&s;titution of this college, is founded upon a free and catholic bottom, and calculated for the equal and general advantage, of every religious denomination of prote&s;tants, will clearly appear, by the following extract from this charter; <Q>AND WHEREAS by the fundamental Conce&s;&s;ions made at the fir&s;t Settlement of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> by
<PB N="8" REF="009752_0006_0F7A47E12AA79DE0">
the Lord <HI>Berkely</HI> and Sir <HI>George Carteret</HI> then Proprietors it was among other things conceded and granted that <HI>no Freemen within the &s;aid Province &s;hould at any time be mole&s;ted puni&s;hed di&s;quieted or called in Que&s;tion for any Difference of Opinion or Practice in Matters of religious Con|cernment who do not actually di&s;turb the Peace of the &s;aid Province they behaving them&s;elves peace|ably and quietly and not u&s;ing this Liberty to Licenciou&s;ne&s;s nor to the civil Injury or outward Di&s;turbance of others</HI> WHEREFORE and for that the &s;aid Petitioners have al&s;o expre&s;&s;ed their earne&s;t De&s;ire that tho&s;e of every religious Deno|mination may have free and equal Liberty and Advantage of Education in the &s;aid College any different Sentiments in Religion notwith&s;tanding &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q> The world hath here the &s;tronge&s;t atte&s;tation, of the liberal principles, not only of the government in granting, but al&s;o of the petiti|oners them&s;elves in their application for a charter. The views of the latter, extended to the common benefit, of all their prote&s;tant brethren. Indeed, had they been otherwi&s;e di&s;po&s;ed, the con&s;titution happily di&s;ables them, from ever perverting the in&s;titution, to any narrow or &s;ini&s;ter purpo&s;es: For
<PB N="9" REF="009752_0007_0F7A47E1BB38D3E0">
the charter further contains the following clau&s;e, <Q>And we do further will give and grant unto the Tru&s;tees of the &s;aid College that they and their Succe&s;&s;ors or the major part of any thirteen of them which &s;hall convene for that Purpo&s;e may make and they are hereby fully empowered to make and e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch Ordinances Orders and Laws as may tend to the good and whol&s;ome Government of the &s;aid College and all the Stu|dents and &s;everal Officers and Mini&s;ters thereof and to the public Benefit of the &s;ame not repug|nant to the Laws and Statutes of our Realm of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> or of this our Province of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey</HI> and not excluding any Per&s;on of any religious Denomination what&s;oever from free and equal Liberty and Advantage of Education or from any of the Liberties Immunities or Privi|ledges of the &s;aid College on Account of his or their being of a religious Profe&s;&s;ion different from the &s;aid Tru&s;tees of the &s;aid College &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>IF any unfavourable repre&s;entations, have been any where made of this in&s;titution, as an illiberal &s;cheme, contrived to &s;ub&s;erve the contracted inte|re&s;ts of a religious party, it manife&s;tly appears,
<PB N="10" REF="009752_0008_0F7A47E8D5AEEF10">
from the above view of its fundamental con&s;titu|tion, that they are untrue and groundle&s;s. And, from its management hitherto, which is no &s;ecret, it may be affirmed in the face of the world, that the execution has been as fair, impartial, and generous, as the plan upon which it was originally founded.</P>
<P>THUS were the tru&s;tees po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a naked charter, without any fund at all to accompli&s;h the undertaking. This, in the eyes of &s;ome, gave it the appearance of an idle chimerical project. Their only re&s;ource, indeed, under the &s;miles of Heaven, was in the beneficence of the advocates and friends of learning. After various &s;olicitations in <HI>America,</HI> the contributions, tho' often generous and worthy of grateful acknowledgment, were found by no means adequate to the execution of &s;o exten&s;ive a de&s;ign. Therefore, in the year 1753, two gentlemen were &s;ent as agents to <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> to &s;olicit additional benefactions. There the in&s;titution was honoured, beyond the mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations, with the approbation and liberality of &s;everal political and eccle&s;ia&s;tical bodies; and of many private per&s;ons
<PB N="11" REF="009752_0009_0F7A47E94FE09EF8">
of the nobility and gentry, among the laity and clergy of various denominations.</P>
<P>THE &s;tudents, in the mean time, who, in the beginning, were few in number, lived di&s;per&s;ed in private lodgings, in the town of <HI>Newark;</HI> at which place, the college was fir&s;t opened; the public academical exerci&s;es being generally performed in the county court-hou&s;e. The difficulties and danger of the&s;e circum&s;tances, both with regard to the morals and literary improvement of the youth, could &s;carcely have been encountered &s;o long, had it not been for the indefatigable indu&s;try and vigilance of Mr. PRESIDENT BURR, the fir&s;t who officiated in that &s;tation. And it was much owing to his unremitted zeal and activity, that this college &s;o &s;uddenly ro&s;e to &s;uch a flouri&s;hing condition.</P>
<P>THE tru&s;tees, thus generou&s;ly a&s;&s;i&s;ted, imme|diately &s;et about erecting a building, in which the &s;tudents might be boarded as well as taught, and live always under the in&s;pection of the college officers, more &s;eque&s;tred from the various tempta|tions, attending a promi&s;cuous conver&s;e with the world, that theatre of folly and di&s;&s;ipation. The
<PB N="12" REF="009752_0010_0F7A47EB841BC200">
little village of <HI>Princeton</HI> was fixed upon, as the mo&s;t convenient &s;ituation; being near the center of the colony, on the public road between <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and not inferior in the &s;alubrity of its air, to any village upon the conti|nent.</P>
<P>THE edifice being nearly fini&s;hed, and con|&s;idered as &s;acred to liberty and revolution-princi|ples, was denominated NASSAU-HALL, from that great deliverer of <HI>Britain,</HI> and a&s;&s;ertor of prote&s;tant liberty, K. WILLIAM the IIId, prince of <HI>Orange</HI> and <HI>Na&s;&s;au.</HI> It will accommodate about 147 &s;tu|dents, computing three to a chamber. The&s;e are 20 feet &s;quare, having two large clo&s;ets, with a window in each, for retirement. It has al&s;o an elegant hall, of genteel workman&s;hip, being a &s;quare of near 40 feet, with a neatly fini&s;hed front gallery. Here is a &s;mall, tho' exceeding good organ, which was obtained by a voluntary &s;ub&s;cription: Oppo&s;ite to which, and of the &s;ame height, is erected a &s;tage, for the u&s;e of the &s;tudents, in their public exhibitions. It is al&s;o ornamented, on one &s;ide, with a portrait of his late maje&s;ty, at full length; and, on the other,
<PB N="13" REF="009752_0011_0F7A47EC4590F510">
with a like picture, (and above it the family-arms neatly carved and gilt,) of his excellency governor BELCHER. The&s;e were bequeathed by the latter to this college. The library, which is on the &s;econd floor, is a &s;pacious room, furni&s;hed at pre&s;ent with about 1200 volumes, all which have been the gifts of the patrons and friends of the in&s;titution, both in <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>America.</HI> There is, on the lower &s;tory, a commodious dining hall, large enough to accommodate as many as the hou&s;e will contain, together with a large kitchen, &s;teward's apartments, &amp;c. The whole &s;tructure, which is of durable &s;tone, having a neat cupola on its top, makes a han&s;ome appearance; and is e&s;teemed to be the mo&s;t conveniently plan'd for the purpo&s;es of a college, of any in <HI>North-America;</HI> being de&s;igned and executed by that approved architect Mr. <HI>Robert Smith,</HI> of <HI>Philadelphia.</HI></P>
<P>IN the year 1757, the &s;tudents, to about the number of 70, removed from <HI>Newark,</HI> the hou&s;e being then &s;o far completed, as to be ready for their reception. Experience &s;oon taught the &s;ociety, the &s;uperior convenience of their new circum&s;tances. The numbers encrea&s;ed very fa&s;t. The country
<PB N="14" REF="009752_0012_0F7A47ED05517EF8">
became more and more convinced of the impor|tance of learning, in general, and the utility of &s;uch a &s;eat of education in particular; both from the regularity of its admini&s;tration, and the figure which &s;everal of its &s;ons already made, in the various literary profe&s;&s;ions. But it was not long before it &s;uffered, what was then looked upon, as an almo&s;t irretrievable lo&s;s. For this &s;ame year died, univer&s;ally deplored, Mr. PRESIDENT BURR.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following epitaph, which ju&s;tly delineates his character, is in&s;cribed on a marble tomb, erected by the college, to his memory.</P>

eulogium, publi&s;hed &s;oon after his decea&s;e.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">By WILLIAM LIVINGSTON, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR></NOTE> The &s;ame year died al&s;o his excellency governor BELCHER, who continued, to the la&s;t, a zealous patron of religion and learning. His library, con&s;i&s;ting of 474 volumes, together with &s;everal other u&s;eful and ornamental articles, he left to this college, of which he was him&s;elf the founder.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="009752_0015_0F7A47EF4BA8F858">THE REV. MR. JONATHAN EDWARDS &s;uc|ceeded to the pre&s;ident&s;hip. Great were the ex|pectations of the public, from the admini&s;tration of a clergyman of his very di&s;tingui&s;hed rank in the literary world. But in a few days after his arrival at <HI>Na&s;&s;au-Hall,</HI> he was &s;eized with a mortal di&s;temper: And it plea&s;ed the &s;overeign of the univer&s;e to call him from this &s;tage of action, before he could apply his &s;kilful hand to the work, which his predece&s;&s;or had &s;o dexterou&s;ly forwarded.</P>
<P>THUS a vacancy again en&s;ued, which continued near eighteen months; when the Rev. Mr. SAMUEL DAVIES, of <HI>Virginia,</HI> was cho&s;en to the Office: A gentleman, well known on both &s;ides the atlantic; but who was, perhaps, no where more e&s;teemed and beloved than at <HI>Na&s;&s;au-Hall;</HI> His fine talents, added not a little, to the dignity and reputation of the &s;ociety, which received many improvements, from his ingenuity and polite ta&s;te. The repeated &s;trokes it had lately &s;uffered, in the lo&s;s of two &s;uch excellent heads, extremely affected the well-wi&s;hers to the intere&s;ts of virtue and literature. But the cloud now &s;eemed to be di&s;per&s;ed, and all things to revive within. For,
<PB N="18" REF="009752_0016_0F7A47F1A465F670">
tho', in the vacancy of the chair, there always had been one of the board of tru&s;tees, appointed to act, <HI>pro tempore,</HI> yet, it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that as to any new improvements in the education of the youth, matters were, in a great mea&s;ure, at a &s;tand.&mdash;But how uncertain are human things! How precarious the mo&s;t elevated hopes! In the month of <HI>February,</HI> 1761, this brilliant genius, in the mid&s;t of his ri&s;ing reputation and growing u&s;efulne&s;s, &s;uddenly re&s;igned his breath, to the incon&s;olable grief of the whole &s;ociety, and univer&s;al lamentation of all good men.</P>
<P>SOON after his death, the Rev. Dr. SAMUEL FINLEY, was elected to the pre&s;ident's chair: a gentleman, who for many years, had di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him&s;elf in the management of a private academy at <HI>Nottingham</HI> in <HI>Pen&s;ylvania;</HI> and in the month of <HI>July</HI> following, he arrived at NASSAU-HALL, and entered upon his office. As to the hap|pine&s;s of this &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, the pre&s;ent flouri&s;hing &s;tate of the college, the general diligence of the youth in their literary pur&s;uits, and the internal harmony and good order &s;o ob&s;ervable in the &s;ociety, are &s;ufficient atte&s;tations.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="009752_0017_0F7A47F27A8166D8">WE &s;hall now give the world &s;ome account of the modes of government and in&s;truction, together with the whole plan of education, the manner and expences of boarding, the circum&s;tances of the fund, and whatever el&s;e may be requi&s;ite to ex|hibit a view of the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the in&s;titution.</P>
<P>IT would be unnece&s;&s;ary and tedious, to trouble the reader, with a minute detail of all the private laws and &s;tatutes, which have been made, from time to time, for the better regulation of its members. They are intended, in general, to &s;ettle the terms of admi&s;&s;ion, to pre&s;cribe the duties, and adju&s;t the powers of the officers, who are univer&s;ally accountable to the tru&s;tees: and e&s;pecially to direct the conduct and &s;tudies of the youth; and to re&s;|train them from &s;uch liberties and indulgencies, as would tend to corrupt their morals, or alienate their minds from a &s;teady application. In the&s;e re|gulations, it hath been the de&s;ign to fix upon a me|dium, between too great a licentiou&s;ne&s;s on the one hand, or an exce&s;&s;ive preci&s;ion on the other. The penalties are generally of the more humane kind; &s;uch as are at once expre&s;&s;ive of compa&s;&s;ion to the offender, and indignation at the offence; &s;uch
<PB N="20" REF="009752_0018_0F7A47F2FA767228">
as are adapted to work upon the nobler principles of humanity, and to move the more honourable &s;prings of good order and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to govern|ment. The laws indeed authori&s;e the infliction of pecuniary mulcts, according to the practice of other colleges; but they are &s;eldom executed, as it would &s;eem to be puni&s;hing the parents for the offences of the children. It cannot be recollected, that there have been above three or four &s;ines impo&s;ed, for upwards of three years la&s;t pa&s;t; nor even one, &s;ince Dr. FINLEY hath pre&s;ided. And in tho&s;e few &s;ingular ca&s;es, it was done, rather for the &s;ake of variety, as another particular method, of fixing a brand of odium upon a bad action, than as a pe|cuniary puni&s;hment. A &s;mall fine will an&s;wer that end, as well as a larger.</P>
<P>IN the exerci&s;e of di&s;cipline, the more u&s;ual proce&s;s is this.&mdash;The pre&s;ident or tutors, &s;eparately or in conjunction, privately rea&s;on with the offender, in order to make him &s;en&s;ible of his ill conduct; and endeavour, by their manner of addre&s;s, to convince him, that in their proceedings again&s;t him, they are actuated from motives of &s;incere regard to his own welfare, and that their &s;everity is
<PB N="21" REF="009752_0019_0F7A47F9F7279160">
not the effect of moro&s;ene&s;s, ill-nature, or per&s;onal re&s;entment. If the offence charged, be denied, evidences are adduced in proof of it. But if the youth di&s;covers an ingenuous temper, by an open frank acknowledgment, &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition is encouraged, by a mitigation of the puni&s;hment. On the other hand, all low and di&s;hone&s;t artifices, particularly lying and wilful equivocation, are re&s;ented as the highe&s;t aggravations. In the re&s;ult, if found guilty, according to the nature of the offence, he is di&s;mi&s;&s;ed either with a private reprimand, or required to &s;ubmit to a public formal admonition;&mdash;or, to make a penitent confe&s;&s;ion in the hail, before the whole hou&s;e;&mdash; or, deprived of &s;ome of the peculiar privileges of his cla&s;s;&mdash;or, for &s;ome limited time, pro|hibited a free conver&s;ation with his fellow &s;tudents, and admi&s;&s;ion into their chambers, as unworthy of their &s;ociety;&mdash;or, &s;u&s;pended from re&s;idence, and all the privileges of the college, until the matter be laid before a committee of &s;ix of the tru&s;tees. In the&s;e &s;everal kinds and degrees of puni&s;hment, an impartial regard is had, not only to the nature of the offence, but al&s;o to the di&s;|po&s;ition, age, rank in college, habitual conduct,

and other circum&s;tances of the offender. Su&s;pen&s;ion is the highe&s;t cen&s;ure the pre&s;ident and tutors can inflict.

It may not be ami&s;s, in this place to remark, that among one hundred and twenty pupils, who, for this year pa&s;t, have been under the care of the immediate governors of the college, there have been but very few, who&s;e conduct hath rendered them obnoxious even to the milder methods of puni&s;hment. This is mentioned, particularly, in due re&s;pect to the gentleman who now pre&s;ides; government being the mo&s;t difficult and delicate part of the pre&s;iden|tal office. To teach a cla&s;&s;ic author, or &s;y&s;tem of philo&s;ophy is a much ea&s;ier ta&s;k, than to govern a &s;ociety of youth, in the gay and volatile period of life, when the pa&s;&s;ions are predominant, and rea&s;on but in a forming &s;tate; a &s;ociety, collected from almo&s;t all the &s;everal colonies on this continent, educated in different manners, with different views, and an endle&s;s variety of tempers and circum|&s;tances.

Hence frugality in the &s;tudent, may &s;ometimes, without meanne&s;s, reduce the accompt. The particulars, as they &s;tand, for the mo&s;t part, in the &s;teward's books, are here &s;pecified, and charged upon an average.</P>

<P><PB N="40" REF="009752_0038_0F7A481345DFE030">THO' this in&s;titution has &s;ucceeded, beyond the expectation of its warme&s;t friends, notwith&s;tanding the &s;evere &s;hocks it received, by the death of three pre&s;idents, in &s;o quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and its un&s;ettled &s;tate, till the chair was filled; yet it &s;till labours under &s;everal deficiencies, which nothing but the beneficent hand of charity can relieve. With mathematical in&s;truments, and an apparatus for experiments in natural philo&s;ophy, it is but very indifferently furni&s;hed. The library wants many of the mo&s;t approved modern writers, as hath been already hinted. It would be al&s;o of eminent &s;ervice, had it revenues ample enough, to &s;upport profe&s;&s;ors in &s;ome of the di&s;tinct branches of literature; who might each make a figure in his own province, could his &s;tudies and in&s;tructions be confined to his peculiar department. A profe&s;&s;or of divinity, e&s;pecially, for the benefit of the theological &s;tudents, would be of &s;ingular utility. At pre&s;ent, there are three tutors, be&s;ides the pre&s;ident. To the&s;e, the college fund, can as yet, afford but &s;canty livings; the tutors particularly, unle&s;s they a&s;&s;ume a vow of celibacy, are unable to continue in their offices for life. Hence it happens, that when a young gentleman has, by &s;tudy and
<PB N="41" REF="009752_0039_0F7A48140127F988">
experience, thoroughly qualified him&s;elf for the employment, he often re&s;igns it; and the tru&s;tees are then obliged to elect another, perhaps out equally fit for it. Affluent revenues are, indeed, too often fatal &s;nares to political bodies, as well as individuals. And &s;hould a profe&s;&s;or&s;hip be con|verted into a money-jobb, or lucrative po&s;t, and the &s;alaries be &s;o con&s;iderable as to become objects of avarice and ambition to unworthy men, it might be a much greater misfortune to the &s;ociety, than its pre&s;ent indigent &s;tate. Hence an income, ju&s;t &s;ufficient to &s;upply the abovementioned defects, and to afford &s;uch livings to a proper number of tutors or profe&s;&s;ors, as would enable them, decently to maintain their families, &s;eems only to be de&s;irable and requi&s;ite.</P>
<P>THE fund, until within about a year pa&s;t, hath not much exceeded 1300 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> but from a lottery, which was generou&s;ly &s;et on foot by a number of gentlemen in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> in favour of the in&s;titu|tion, it was increa&s;ed to nearly 2800 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> the neat produce of the &s;ame, after nece&s;&s;ary charges, and lo&s;&s;es which u&s;ually happen, be&s;ides what was di&s;bur&s;ed to pay urgent debts, being about 1500 <ABBR>l.</ABBR>
<PB N="42" REF="009752_0040_0F7A4814BA4E2D90">
Exclu&s;ive of the annual &s;upport of officers, the expences from other quarters are not incon&s;iderable; nay, do yearly increa&s;e, as the number of &s;tudents increa&s;e. The tru&s;tees have been obliged to com|plete the chambers of one whole &s;tory of the building, which were at fir&s;t left unfini&s;hed, not being then wanted; and to build a large kitchen, with &s;ervants apartments, both to an&s;wer its peculiar intention, and, at the &s;ame time, to leave more room for lodgings in the college it&s;elf. This too &s;till remains without a proper inclo&s;ure of its court|yard and back grounds; which would greatly add to the beauty, as well as real convenience of the hall.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the plate hereunto annexed, the court-yard is repre|&s;ented as inclo&s;ed by a pale-&s;ence, in like manner with that of the pre&s;ident's hou&s;e: But this is done only from the fancy of the engraver.</NOTE> The&s;e, together with &s;everal other mediums of expence, will unavoidably exhau&s;t all the ca&s;h, that can po&s;&s;ibly be &s;pared from its &s;lender fund. Hence, is ea&s;ily &s;een, the impo&s;&s;ibility under pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, of making new additions or improvements, either in regard to books, an ap|paratus, or e&s;tabli&s;hment of profe&s;&s;or&s;hips. Indeed, from the countenance of the general a&s;&s;embly of
<PB N="43" REF="009752_0041_0F7A481726B178C8">
this province, in pa&s;&s;ing an act for a lottery of three thou&s;and pounds, for the benefit of this college, &s;ome good addition will probably be made to its revenues. But the returns of this lottery, which was lately drawn, are not yet made; the accompts being &s;till un&s;ettled. However, much greater lo&s;&s;es have accrued therein, than might have been rea&s;onably expected, e&s;pecially from the very unfortunate i&s;&s;ue of the tickets left, on the ri&s;que of the college, at the time of drawing. So that the managers have rea&s;on to think, that, on the clo&s;e of their books, the clear profits will not much exceed <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 2200. Such an acce&s;&s;ion can only enable the tru&s;tees, to make &s;ome addition, perhaps, to the annual allowances of the college officers; tho' not &s;uch as will be &s;ufficient to retain them for life, in the character of profe&s;&s;ors, much le&s;s to main|tain a greater number. Be&s;ides, it is not impro|bable, that by the time they reap the intere&s;t of it, another building may become nece&s;&s;ary: For an addition of 25 or 30 &s;tudents more would fill the pre&s;ent hou&s;e, in &s;uch a manner, as that by no po&s;&s;ible contrivance, it could be made to contain a greater number, with any tolerable convenience or comfort. And &s;hould the numbers increa&s;e,
<PB N="44" REF="009752_0042_0F7A481802388EC8">
in the &s;ame proportion they have done, for the&s;e three years pa&s;t, (which is as 50 to 70) the nece&s;|&s;ity of &s;uch additional building, will be no di&s;tant event. This, however, would be a work im|po&s;&s;ible to be carried into execution, upon the &s;trength of the pre&s;ent funds.</P>
<P>BUT be&s;ide the occa&s;ions of public encourage|ment abovementioned, and the many private benefactions received, &s;ince the foundation of this &s;eminary; it is matter of plea&s;ure to acquaint its friends, that, not long &s;ince, a very generous legacy was ordered in the will of the late col. <HI>Alford,</HI> of <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> in the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay:</HI> The &s;um de&s;igned for this college, is not yet preci&s;ely a&s;certained, that being left to the di&s;cre|tion of his executors: It is pre&s;umed however, from good intelligence, that the appropriation here will not be le&s;s in value than <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 500 &s;terling. Benefactions of this &s;ort are peculiarly honourable,&mdash; an indubitable indication of a warm regard for the intere&s;ts of learning, and of the te&s;tator's high &s;en&s;e of the utility of this &s;eat of education in particular. No actions of a man's life are more memorable, than his deeds of liberality, before
<PB N="45" REF="009752_0043_0F7A481879EA0108">
the hour of death; when chiefly he con&s;iders, what di&s;tribution of the gifts of Heaven, may be mo&s;t agreeable to the will of his divine bene|factor. May providence excite an emulation in the brea&s;ts of others, among the virtuous and opulent, to follow an example of &s;uch laudable and chri&s;tian benevolence: A benevolence, which will extend its influence to remote po&s;terity, and advance the genuine felicity of their country, when they are received into <HI>everla&s;ting habitations,</HI> and are triumphing in the enjoyment of a glorious RECOMPENSE OF REWARD.</P>
<P>THUS is exhibited a faithful account of the origin and pre&s;ent &s;tate of the college of <HI>New-Jer&s;ey:</HI>&mdash;A college, originally de&s;igned for the promotion of the general intere&s;ts of chri&s;tianity, as well as the cultivation of human &s;cience. This end therefore is kept in view, in all the in&s;tructions and modes of di&s;cipline: To inculcate or even recommend the di&s;criminating opinions of any one prote&s;tant denomination in preference to another, is carefully avoided. In tho&s;e matters, the &s;tudents are left without any bya&s;s offered to their private judgments; and are always allowed, without
<PB N="46" REF="009752_0044_0F7A481E8645E948">
re&s;traint, to attend the religious wor&s;hip of any prote&s;tant &s;ociety, whenever they have oppor|tunity.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, it is pre&s;umed it mu&s;t appear manife&s;t upon reflection, to every &s;erious ob&s;erver, that providence hath, in a peculiar manner, &s;uper|intended the affairs of this nur&s;ery, from its foun|dation to the pre&s;ent time. And indeed, it is e&s;teemed by its directors their highe&s;t honour and happine&s;s, that the almighty hath vouch&s;afed &s;o remarkably to countenance and &s;ucceed their undertaking, and thereby to encourage their humble expectations of his continued benediction. To the &s;ingular favour of Heaven, on the means of in&s;truction here u&s;ed, it mu&s;t be gratefully a&s;cribed, that many youth who have come to <HI>Na&s;&s;au-Hall</HI> for education, without any ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the obligations either of natural or revealed re|ligion, have been here effectually reformed, become men of &s;olid and rational piety, and now appear upon the &s;tage of public action, employing their talents to the honour of the &s;upreme Be&s;tower, and in promoting the good of mankind. Hence the managers of this &s;eminary are emboldened to hope,
<PB N="47" REF="009752_0045_0F7A4820E9132AD0">
that while the original de&s;ign of its e&s;tabli&s;hment is &s;teadily pur&s;ued, the &s;ame indulgent providence which hath hitherto &s;upported it, amid&s;t the re|proaches of envy, and the oppo&s;itions of malice, will &s;till rai&s;e up benefactors to &s;upply its defici|encies; and &s;ucceed their di&s;intere&s;ted endeavours to train up our youth in the paths of piety and erudition, for the future &s;ervice of their country, in any civil or eccle&s;ia&s;tical employments.</P>
