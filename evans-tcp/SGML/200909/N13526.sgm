<HEAD>Truth is great, and will prevail.</HEAD>
<P>THIS maxim has been a&s;&s;ented to in all countries, and in all ages; but the grand que&s;tion has been, WHAT IS TRUTH? Pilate a&s;ked it, but waited not for the an&s;wer. So far from it, that the fear of man moved him to give &s;entence again&s;t the eternal SON OF GOD, who came into our world on purpo&s;e to <HI>bear witne&s;s unto</HI> THE TRUTH. Jews and Gentiles were confederates in this helli&s;h act, and all nations and denominations ever &s;ince have been more agreed in oppo&s;ing the truth, than in any other point: Yet truth prevails &s;till.</P>
<P>That there is one &s;upreme BEING, who&s;e kingdom ruleth over all, is the fir&s;t and capital article of truth, which no nation upon earth were ever able to era&s;e entirely out of their minds; for no government could ever be e&s;tabli&s;h|ed among them&s;elves, without appeals to HIM for the truth of what was a&s;&s;erted, and to avenge inju&s;tice, and the violation of contracts and engagements.</P>
<P>That it is the indi&s;pen&s;able duty of every man to love his creator and pre&s;erver with all his faculties and powers, and to love his neighbour as him&s;elf, is a truth in&s;eparably connected with the other: For while JE|HOVAH remains infinitely and unchangeably good, and we remain his offspring, our obligation to love him can never be di&s;annulled or abated; and his command, to love our neighbours as our&s;elves, is as immutable as his perfections are.</P>
<P>That all mankind, in their natural condition, are in a &s;tate of revolt from this heavenly ruler, is a truth as evident as the other; what need el&s;e could there be for
<PB N="4" REF="017083_0004_0F9FC224052828F0">the&s;e appeals and re&s;traints? The attempts that have often been made again&s;t this truth, have always con|firmed it, and have demon&s;trated the corruption of the authors of tho&s;e attempts. Nothing can di&s;cover a more mean and di&s;hone&s;t di&s;po&s;ition, than for a per&s;on to &s;teal the property of another, and then to labour to adorn and exalt him&s;elf therewith, while he tries hard to &s;ink the credit of the true owner, &s;o as to &s;et &s;elf above him: Yet this is the very practice of all tho&s;e who &s;et up their rea&s;on above divine revelation. The writings of the greate&s;t men in Pagan countries are full of the intrigues, adulteries, thefts and murders, of their imaginary deities; which, by God's righteous judgment, and from their natural tendency, have pro|duced like abominations in their wor&s;hippers; becau&s;e they <HI>changed the truth of God into a lie.</HI> Rom. i. 18&mdash;32. And tho&s;e who were favoured with the oracles of God, and yet did the <HI>&s;ame thing,</HI> thereby brought upon them&s;elves a much greater condemnation than the others did. Rom. ii. 1&mdash;24. If &s;o, then what advantage can it be to have tho&s;e oracles? An&s;wer, <HI>much every way: For what if &s;ome did not believe?</HI> Shall their <HI>unbelief make the faith of God without effect?</HI> The thought is to be rejected with the utmo&s;t abhorrence. <HI>Yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is writ|ten, that thou mighte&s;t be ju&s;tified in thy &s;ayings, and mighte&s;t overcome when thou art judged.</HI> Rom. iii. 1&mdash;4. This is the exact &s;tate of the controver&s;y. Men have a&s;&s;um|ed the judgment &s;eat, and have arraigned the <HI>&s;ayings of God</HI> to their bar. This practice began near the forbid|den tree, Gen. iii. 1&mdash;6; and from that day to this men have been <HI>ever learning,</HI> and yet, of them&s;elves, were <HI>never able to come to the knowledge of the truth;</HI> and that becau&s;e the judge is the criminal, who cannot live in that way any longer than he is kept in darkne&s;s;
<PB N="5" REF="017083_0005_0F9FC224B95B74D8">for whenever the authority of truth takes place in his con&s;cience, <HI>&s;in revives, and he dies;</HI> and his only way of relief is by faith in the perfect obedience and atoning &s;acrifice of our great &s;urety, who <HI>offered him&s;elf without &s;pot to God.</HI> Rom. vii. 1&mdash;12, Heb. ix 14, and x. 1&mdash;14. Una&s;&s;i&s;ted rea&s;on could never go any farther in this re&s;pect, than to move men to imbrue their hands in the blood of their own children, by offering the fruit of their body for the &s;in of their &s;oul: Yet many are now guilty of &s;tealing a finer dre&s;s for human nature, from the oracles of God, and then of improving the &s;ame again&s;t the authority of the book they took it from; &s;o that in&s;tead of &s;aying, let God be true, but every man a liar; their argument is, that every man is not a liar, therefore in &s;everal points God does not &s;peak the truth! And it is a common thing for the&s;e rea&s;oners, to claim a power for them&s;elves which they deny to JEHOVAH; and daily to practi&s;e that, under his name, which, with reverence be it &s;poken, was never within HIS POWER to do! Num. xxiii. 19, John x. 35, 2d Tim. ii. 13, Heb. vi. 18.</P>
<P>They often in&s;i&s;t upon it, that men cannot de&s;erve prai&s;e for doing right, nor blame for doing wrong, un|le&s;s they have power within them&s;elves to act with mo|tive or again&s;t motive, as they plea&s;e. If their volunta|ry actions are not determined by what is within them, they &s;ay they are not free. Yet the &s;ame men are po&s;i|tive, that God's choice of &s;ome to &s;alvation, while he leaves the re&s;t to peris;h in their &s;ins, mu&s;t be determined by what he &s;ees in them, and not in him&s;elf; or el&s;e, &s;ay they, he would be a re&s;pecter of per&s;ons. Thus &s;elf-determination is claimed for man, but is denied to God; directly in the face of Chri&s;t, and the in&s;pired apo&s;tle. Matt. xi. 26, Rom. xi. 33&mdash;36. The evi|dent cau&s;e of this horrid impiety, is a &s;ecret conceit,
<PB N="6" REF="017083_0006_0F9FC225826F0430">that there is a good to be obtained which is better than truth, and for which truth may be di&s;pen&s;ed with, and contradicted; therefore, though it is impo&s;&s;ible for God to lie, or to deny him&s;elf, yet men often do it, in hopes of obtaining that imaginary good. Indeed Chri&s;t calls us to deny our&s;elves, and to take-up our cro&s;s dai|ly; but it is only that corrupt and delu&s;ive &s;elf, which is &s;et up again&s;t the revealed will of God. He requires us daily to cro&s;s our lu&s;ts, and &s;elf-righteous conceits; while Satan tempts us to cro&s;s the truth, and the light of our own con&s;ciences; and can any rational &s;oul he&s;i|tate a minute upon which of them is to be regarded!</P>
<P>That all men have a power within them to act in every ca&s;e as then &s;eems be&s;t to them, is a truth as fully given into by the advocates for divine &s;overeignty, as by any free-willer on earth. Perhaps Dr. Owen opened and defended the great doctrines of &s;overeign grace, as well as any man did in the la&s;t century; and he &s;ays, <Q>to &s;uppo&s;e that in all things of &s;piritual and eternal concernment, men are not determined and acted eve|ry one by his own judgment, is an imagination of men who think but little of what they are, or do, or &s;ay, or write. Even tho&s;e who &s;hut their eyes again&s;t the light, and follow in the herd,, re&s;olving not to en|quire into any of the&s;e things, do it becau&s;e <HI>they judge it be&s;t for them &s;o to do</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Original of evangelical churches, p. <HI>101.</HI></NOTE>.</Q> And the greate&s;t writer again&s;t a &s;elf-determining power in man, that our age has &s;een, &s;ays, <Q>liberty is the power, opportunity or advantage, that any one has to do as he plea&s;es, or to conduct in any re&s;pect according to his plea&s;ure.</Q> And &s;ays he, <Q>it is demon&s;trable, and I think has been demon&s;trated, that no nece&s;&s;ity of men's volitions that I maintain is incon&s;i&s;tent with this liberty.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Edwards on the will; third edition, p. <HI>38.</HI> Appendix, p. <HI>2.</HI></NOTE>.</Q>

Yet how unwilling are many, even in this land of go&s;pel light, to yield their &s;ouls to this authority? Being called by our churches to act as their agent in this great affair, I have had cau&s;e to know more of the aver&s;ion of many thereto, than mo&s;t others have; of which take the following plain account.</P>
<P>When a new plan of government was formed for the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts State, which took in their old taxing laws for religious teachers, I was called to meet our com|mittee at Bo&s;ton upon it, in February, 1778. And find|ing that &s;aid plan was to be e&s;tabli&s;hed or &s;et a&s;ide by our next General Court, we drew up a petition, directed to them, that it might be fixed, <Q>as a fundamental principle of our con&s;titution, that religious mini&s;ters &s;hall be &s;upported only by Chri&s;t's authority, and not at all by a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment and &s;ecular force.</Q> This was &s;igned by many, in various parts of the State, which alarmed the mini&s;ters who were &s;upported by tax and compul&s;ion; and one of them, who was called to deli|ver the election &s;ermon to that A&s;&s;embly, &s;aid therein, <Q>the fear and reverence of God, and the terrors or eternity, are the mo&s;t powerful re&s;traints upon the minds of men.&mdash;Let the re&s;traints of religion once be broken down, as they infallibly would be by leav|ing the &s;ubject of public wor&s;hip to the humours of the multitude, and we might well defy all human wi&s;dom and power to &s;upport and pre&s;erve order and

In September, 1778, a mini&s;ter of the fir&s;t church in Bo&s;ton, hearing of the defeat of our army on Rhode-I&s;land, delivered a lecture before many of our rulers, from the &s;eventh of Jo&s;hua, wherein he tried hard to per&s;uade them, that one of the <HI>accur&s;ed things</HI> which cau&s;ed that defeat, was becau&s;e a new law had not been made and enforced, to help mini&s;ters about their &s;alaries.

<P>After Robert Sandeman, with his &s;atyrical pen, had, in a convincing manner, expo&s;ed the corruption of tho&s;e who imagine, that reconciliation to God can take its ri&s;e from any thing good in man, Dr. Chauncy publi&s;h|ed a volume of &s;ermons, in which he &s;ays, <Q>it is &s;aid by mo&s;t Chri&s;tian writers, that the fir&s;t man was &s;o placed, under the natural or moral law of God, as that he mu&s;t work his way to life by perfectly doing all things commanded by it; in&s;omuch that he could not have obtained it, but by per&s;evering obe|dience in every point of duty, without the lea&s;t failure. But this is &s;aid entirely without book. The &s;cripture nowhere in&s;inuates, that he was under <HI>&s;uch a covenant of works.</HI> It &s;ugge&s;ts, on the contrary, that God, in favour to him, did not put him upon &s;o <HI>&s;evere</HI> a trial for life. His trial, if we may believe the &s;acred record of it, was in a <HI>&s;ingle in&s;tance,</HI> and this not of doing, but of forbearing to do. Gen. ii. 16, 17.&mdash;It would be the exact truth, &s;hould I &s;ay, that the parents of men, while innocent, in common with their po&s;terity &s;ince the lap&s;e, could have ob|tained life in no way but that of <HI>grace through faith</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">His <HI>12</HI> &s;ermons, <HI>1765,</HI> p. <HI>18&mdash;20.</HI></NOTE>.</Q> I will do this writer the honor to &s;ay, that he has here &s;tated their &s;entiments with as much fairne&s;s and preci|&s;ion
<PB N="14" REF="017083_0014_0F9FC23236AFDCD8">as any that I ever &s;aw upon that &s;ide of the que|&s;tion. And the difference betwixt his ideas and mine about this matter is chiefly upon the following points.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. He &s;uppo&s;es that Adam was to work his way <HI>to life,</HI> after he was created; but I believe that the <HI>image of God, in which he was created,</HI> was his life.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. I know that faith in God was as nece&s;&s;ary then for the <HI>continuance</HI> of life, as it is now in Chri&s;t for the <HI>recovery</HI> thereof; but <HI>grace,</HI> in the go&s;pel &s;en&s;e of the word, means relief to the guilty and mi&s;erable, in di&s;tinction from <HI>works,</HI> which innocent man was to have lived by, if he had continued in that &s;tate. Debt means the reward that is promi&s;ed, which becomes due when the condition of it is performed; and that reward may then be claimed by law, whatever difference there is in value betwixt the work and the reward. The angels of light will ever ac|knowledge an infinite difference between their works and the reward they receive therefor; which at the &s;ame time is as di&s;tinct from free grace to &s;inners, as heaven is from earth. It de&s;troys the nature, both of grace and works, to confound them together. Rom. xi. 6. God never fails to pay all his debts; and &s;ooner or later he will make all to know his right to <HI>give grace and glory</HI> to whom he plea&s;eth, while he ju&s;tly inflicts endle&s;s puni&s;hment upon impenitent &s;inners. How &s;olemn and convincing is that demand, <HI>is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil becau&s;e I am good!</HI> Matt. xx. 15. He is the fountain of all good; and the root of all error is a conceit that good can be had in &s;ome other way, better than in obedience to his revealed will. James i. 13&mdash;25.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. This author &s;up|po&s;es that perfect and per&s;evering obedience, in every point of duty required by the moral law, would have been too <HI>&s;evere a trial</HI> for life to innocent Adam; which in my view is &s;o contrary to truth, that a turning there|from
<PB N="15" REF="017083_0015_0F9FC2333648CA20">was his death. The forbidden tree was the te&s;t, to try whether or not he would regard God's &s;overeignty over all, and his property in all the creatures he had made; and by taking and eating of that fruit man rebelled again&s;t HEAVEN, and &s;eized upon the earth as his own. And when our Saviour came, the Jews, from the &s;ame principle, &s;aid, <HI>this is the heir, come let us kill him, and let us &s;eize on his inheritance.</HI> Matt. xxi. 38. Every wi&s;e ruler will lay his plans &s;o as to need as little altera|tion hereafter as may be, and never to be defeated or di&s;appointed in his de&s;igns, if he can help it; yet tho&s;e who firmly hold, and boldly a&s;&s;ert, that JEHOVAH'S plan is ab&s;olutely perfect in all the&s;e re&s;pects, &s;o that <HI>nothing can be put to it, not any thing taken from it,</HI> are often looked upon and treated as the wor&s;t of men; and that becau&s;e men are not willing to <HI>fear before</HI> HIM. Eccl. iii. 14. Our Saviour was &s;o far from removing or abating this fear, that he greatly enforced it; and when Peter would fondly have prevented his dying for us, he rejected the attempt, with the &s;ame dete&s;tation as he would have &s;hewn to the devil him&s;elf; and al&s;o a&s;&s;ures us, that the only time for having our debts paid by him, is before we are <HI>ca&s;t into pri&s;on.</HI> Matt. v. 17&mdash;26, and xvi. 23. Nor can the conceit of tho&s;e, who deny the endle&s;s puni&s;hment of &s;uch as die in an impenitent &s;tate, be true, till rebellion again&s;t HEAVEN &s;hall become a finite evil, &s;o that finite doings and &s;ufferings, either in this or another world, can purge it away. Nor, in|deed, till JEHOVAH &s;hall become a <HI>&s;ervant</HI> to peri&s;hing worms, &s;o as to go and come at their bidding or call. Job xxi. 14, 15, I&s;a. xxvii. 11, and xliii. 24, Jer. ii. 27, Acts iv. 12, Dan. xii. 2.</ITEM>

<P>The ca&s;e of the Bapti&s;t accu&s;ers, before mentioned, is as follows. On Sept. 8, 1767, a number of our elders and brethren met at Warren, and agreed upon an annual
<PB N="16" REF="017083_0016_0F9FC235EC145128">meeting, under the name of the Warren A&s;&s;ociation; the de&s;ign whereof they &s;ince publi&s;hed in the&s;e words, viz. "we are not in&s;en&s;ible of the attempts that have been made by mini&s;ters, in various ways, to a&s;&s;ume a cla&s;&s;ical power and juri&s;diction over the churches; nei|ther are we unaware of the evil and pernicious effects of their obtaining &s;uch a power; which therefore we de&s;ire we may always watch again&s;t. Yet, as it is cer|tain that the churches in the apo&s;tolic age did, by me&s;|&s;engers and letters, hold a friendly corre&s;pondence with each other, for mutual advice, help and comfort, and &s;ometimes by the meeting of many of them together for that purpo&s;e; and as we are commanded to follow af|ter the things that make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another, we have been convinced, that it is both warrantable and expedient for our churches, that are &s;o much &s;cattered through this land, and who have here|tofore been &s;o much unacquainted with each other, thus, to a&s;&s;ociate together for prayer, preaching of the word, mutual advice and endeavours to promote union and go&s;|pel order among them, and to guard again&s;t the contrary; as well as to afford what a&s;&s;i&s;tance we can to flocks that are de&s;titute, weak or oppre&s;&s;ed." This was publi&s;hed in Sept. 1771; and this plan has been &s;o fully ob&s;erved, that no <HI>appeals</HI> of any per&s;onal ca&s;e of di&s;cipline in any church, nor <HI>complaints</HI> again&s;t any other community of Chri&s;tians, have ever been admitted by the A&s;&s;ociation; and it &s;tands on record in our church book, that the do|ing of any &s;uch thing would break the conditions that we joined them upon. They have been &s;o far from it, that when a breach of communion once happened betwixt two churches in the A&s;&s;ociation, which affected others, and an attempt from thence was made to bring the ca&s;e before this body, it was po&s;itively refu&s;ed; and the contending parties were prevailed with, to agree in
<PB N="17" REF="017083_0017_0F9FC235F6354608">calling a few judicious men, to hear and labour with them upon it; and &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing was granted upon the&s;e means, as entirely to remove the difficulty. Yet one Bapti&s;t teacher has di&s;covered &s;ome di&s;like to our A&s;&s;ociation for ten years pa&s;t, which might partly be cau&s;ed by information, that by this means was &s;pread, of his pre&s;uming to break bread to a minor part of a Bapti&s;t church, whom the majority had cen&s;ured; this information being an impediment in the way of his preaching el&s;ewhere. His mind has al&s;o been &s;omewhat intangled with Sandeman's notion, of exalting the atone|ment in &s;uch a manner as to pay little or no regard to a divine work <HI>within us,</HI> of conviction by the law, and relief by the go&s;pel. And, in preaching at Chelmsford la&s;t &s;pring, he delivered &s;uch <HI>que&s;tions about the law,</HI> as greatly burdened the church who heard it; though one or two members were plea&s;ed therewith, they having privately propagated &s;uch que&s;tions there for &s;ome years. When &s;aid teacher came there again in the fall, the church refu&s;ed to admit him to preach therein again, till he &s;hould give them &s;atisfaction. Upon this two brethren got five or &s;ix &s;i&s;ters to join with them in openly withdrawing from the church, and &s;etting up a &s;eparate meeting near by, to hear that teacher, without &s;tating the principles they differed upon. A council was &s;oon after called by the church, whereof I was &s;cribe; and when we had gone through with hearing other ca&s;es, the church was de&s;irous of laying this al&s;o before us. Said teacher and brethren were pre|&s;ent; and though they were not active in calling the council, and were unwilling to &s;ubmit any cau&s;e there|to, as &s;uch, yet they con&s;ented to di&s;cour&s;e with us upon the&s;e affairs. This was done for about two hours; and then we &s;aid in our re&s;ult, "it appears plainly, that they hold, that God the Father has given the govern|ment
<PB N="18" REF="017083_0018_0F9FC2360529D6A0">of the world into the hands of his Son, in &s;uch a manner, that none of the human race are now under the cur&s;e of the law that was given to Adam; and that Chri&s;t's mini&s;ters are &s;o far from being called to preach that law, and to tell any men that they are under the cur&s;e of it, that they que&s;tioned with earne&s;tne&s;s, whe|ther &s;o to preach is not to preach a lie! Which opinion we fully believe to be contrary to the holy &s;criptures of truth, and of a very dangerous and pernicious tendency to the &s;ouls of men; and therefore we earne&s;tly call up|on the&s;e brethren to retract it, and warn all again&s;t it." Great relief was hereby given to the church, and two valuable men were baptized, and added thereto the next Lord's day. I gave no copies of our re&s;ult to any but the churches immediately concerned; yet tho&s;e two brethren, who &s;igned this publication again&s;t us, &s;ay, "every Chri&s;tian man's character is too &s;acred to be to&s;t about at the plea&s;ure of every one.&mdash;For a &s;elect number from &s;everal churches to undertake to judge &s;uch ca&s;es, may well alarm us to look about us, and &s;ee where our privileges are going; for we think it is not hard to &s;ee what &s;uch a&s;&s;uming councils are aiming at. This council have excommunicated two brethren&mdash;this &s;olemn warning is like hanging them in gibbets.&mdash;But may indulgent heaven interpo&s;e for us, &s;eeing vain is the help of man<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Remarks, p. <HI>4, 11, 12.</HI></NOTE>."</P>
<P>How far their pa&s;&s;ions have carried them beyond the truth, is left to con&s;ideration. They had a&s;&s;umed the power to make a &s;chi&s;m in that church, and to write an account of it, by &s;aid teacher, to the pa&s;tor of ano|ther church, whom they hoped to have drawn to their party, before we met there in council; and we did no more to them than I have related, let them call it by what name they will. They own that they a&s;ked the
<PB N="19" REF="017083_0019_0F9FC236E42DBBE8">que&s;tion we have mentioned, and al&s;o the following, viz. "if any of the human race are under the law, in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, and upon the &s;ame conditions, as it was delivered to Adam, what will ever bring them from under it, &s;eeing Chri&s;t dieth no more?" And they now &s;ay, "we hold, that mankind are not without law to God, but under law to Chri&s;t: Now the law of Chri&s;t, which mankind are now under, is for &s;ub&s;tance the &s;ame which was given to Adam, namely, to love God and our neighbour; but it is not given to men, nor are men holden under it upon the &s;ame terms and condi|tions as it was given to Adam.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. <HI>7, 9.</HI></NOTE>."</P>
<P>In my view, this is &s;o far from <HI>rightly dividing the word of truth,</HI> that it is really a <HI>confounding</HI> of law and grace together. They have taken words which are peculiar to the regenerate, 1 Cor. ix. 21, and have ap|plied them to all the human race, which, alas! is too common through the world! Our Saviour plainly ap|plies the moral law to mankind in general, and &s;ays, <HI>This do, and thou &s;halt live.</HI> Matt. xxii. 40, compar|ed with Luke x. 28.

The oldne&s;s of the letter makes every defect a bar again&s;t coming; the newne&s;s of the &s;pirit makes the greatne&s;s of our evils and di&s;tempers a rea&s;on why we &s;hould come without delay. P&s;al. xxv. 11&mdash;14. The ark was to be carried upon the prie&s;t's &s;houlders, according to God's &s;pecial direction. Numb. ix. 17&mdash;23.

Yet the two la&s;t publications again&s;t me are built entirely upon a &s;uppo&s;ition of its being a <HI>legal certificate;</HI> and upon this &s;uppo&s;ition it is repre&s;ented in the fir&s;t of them, that either a <HI>new revelation</HI> or <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> had moved me <Q>to di&s;pen&s;e with my &s;acred promi&s;es and con&s;cience;</Q> and the writer &s;ays, <Q>I hope his laudable example will be punctually imitated by all others of the &s;ame pro|fe&s;&s;ion.</Q> And he &s;till pleads for this, in his la&s;t pub|lication,

<P>In reply to him, I a&s;k, why the <HI>&s;pirit of truth</HI> does not guide us into <HI>all truth at once?</HI> John xvi. 12, 13.

But when it came to be contended for, in a way which ob&s;tructed that great and good end, he refu&s;ed to <HI>give place by &s;ub|jection, even for an hour, that the truth of the go&s;pel might remain with the churches;</HI> and he had no mercy to &s;hew to <HI>di&s;&s;imulation,</HI> no not in Peter him&s;elf. Gal. ii. 4&mdash;14. And the word of truth &s;hews, that the victo|ry of the church, over that evil in him who pretends to be Peter's &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and his followers, will be gra|dual, viz. <HI>over the bea&s;t, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name,</HI> which is the number of a MAN. Be it in units, tens or hundreds, it is no more than <HI>man</HI> &s;et up in God's place. 2 The&s;&s;. ii. 3, 4, Rev. xiii. 18, and xv. 2. And that the pow|er now contended for is of that nature, is mo&s;t evident. For in the Bo&s;ton Evening-Po&s;t of May 17, 1773, mention was made of their law to tax all members of the church of England in each town, with others, which the church mini&s;ter, if they had any, was to draw out of the town-trea&s;ury; and then it was &s;aid, <Q>had the &s;ame prudent precaution been taken with re&s;pect to Anabapti&s;ts, when they were exempted from being tax|ed towards the maintenance of the mini&s;ters of the churches by law <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed,</HI> tho&s;e avaricious and di&s;&s;o|lute per&s;ons, who get under water to wa&s;h away their mini&s;ters rates, without any expectation or de&s;ire of

<PB N="34" REF="017083_0034_0F9FC244F9662EF0">to <HI>divide,</HI> and conquer his little colony; and all the di&s;or|ders, which by the&s;e and other means were cau&s;ed therein, have been a prevailing argument for tyranny in the Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts; and their tyranny has been a &s;trong argument for the continuance of tho&s;e di&s;orders in the other State ever &s;ince; and how far the&s;e two parties have now been confederates in trying to cru&s;h our attempts to remove that tyranny, and tho&s;e di&s;orders, I know not.</P>
<P>Some would have us look to Britain for help again&s;t the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ors; but we have no idea of any &s;uch thing. For their king, in a &s;peech to his new parliament, Nov. 2, 1780, exclaims aloud again&s;t others "boundle&s;s ambition;" and urges for &s;uch preparations and exertions, as, &s;ays he, "&s;hall convince our enemies, that we <HI>will</HI> not &s;ubmit to receive law from any powers what&s;oever." And yet before this &s;peech arrived among us, a declaration was received from his commi&s;&s;ioners at New-York, which would fain per&s;uade us, that the Briti&s;h parliament have received law from America, &s;o as to give up more to us than we a&s;ked for before the war; and thereupon they earne&s;tly invite us to return under their protection, while in the &s;ame declara|tion they exhort tho&s;e whom they call <HI>the loyal,</HI> "to per&s;e|vere in <HI>their integrity,</HI> for the pre&s;ervation of <HI>their religion</HI> and liberties." Compare this with the bi&s;hop of Landa&s;t's &s;ermon, and who can put any tru&s;t in &s;uch men? Such men as a century ago accu&s;ed Dr. Owen and his friends of fa|vouring POPERY, becau&s;e they refu&s;ed to join in fellow&s;hip with the church of England, who&s;e claims of arbitrary pow|er &s;oon after brought the nation to the brink of ruin. In an&s;wer to that accu&s;ation, Dr. Owen ob&s;erved, that all the reformation from popery which any had attained to, was
<PB N="35" REF="017083_0035_0F9FC24645856808">built entirely upon the&s;e three principles.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That the ho|ly &s;criptures are our only rule in religious matters.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That each rational man has an equal right to judge of their meaning for him&s;elf.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That all church power, and office power therein, is derived from Chri&s;t, by his word and &s;pi|rit, to each particular church. That the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of mini|&s;terial power is &s;ecured, by his continuing, according to his promi&s;e, to call &s;ouls effectually by his grace, and to furni&s;h men with <HI>&s;piritual gi&s;ts,</HI> fit for &s;uch offices as he has in&s;ti|tuted, and making it the duty of the church to call them thereto and &s;et them apart therein. And &s;ays he, "tho&s;e who plead for a <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ive mini&s;try</HI> without re&s;pect to the&s;e things, without re&s;olving both the authority and office of it unto them, do but erect a <HI>dead image,</HI> or embrace a dead carca&s;e, in&s;tead of the living and life-giving in&s;titutions of Chri&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Original of evangelical churches, <HI>1681,</HI> p. <HI>165, 291&mdash;297.</HI></NOTE>."</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>This was emphatically the ca&s;e with New-England, when God was plea&s;ed remarkably to pour out his &s;pirit, and glo|riou&s;ly to revive religion therein, forty years ago. This Mr. Edwards, in his book of five parts, very plainly proved. But in an&s;wer thereto, the next year, Dr. Chauncy laboured hard to prove, that the <HI>itinerant preaching,</HI> which was the chief means of that work, was a thing of very bad and dan|gerous tendency, and that the fir&s;t leader therein was guilty of very <HI>ra&s;h and uncharitable judging,</HI> for expre&s;&s;ing his fears, that many, nay mo&s;t of the teachers in the land, did not ex|perimentally know Je&s;us Chri&s;t; therefore he raked this country, and even ran&s;acked the church of Rome, for filthy &s;tories to ca&s;t upon the in&s;truments and &s;ubjects of that work. And to prove that the mini&s;ters of New-England had not then lo&s;t their character, he produced Dr. Cotton Mather's te&s;timony in their favour, who &s;aid, "no man becomes a mini&s;ter in our churches, till he fir&s;t be a communi|cant; and no man becomes a communicant, until he hath been <HI>&s;everely</HI> examined about his <HI>regeneration,</HI> as well as con|ver&s;ation." But when was it &s;o? This te&s;timony was pub|li&s;hed in 1696. But twelve years after, it was openly preach|ed
<PB N="36" REF="017083_0036_0F9FC24679252680">up, that the Lord's &s;upper was a converting ordinance; which doctrine had &s;pread through the country before this revival began. And to guard again&s;t the increa&s;e of the Bap|ti&s;ts in Bo&s;ton in 1772, Dr. Chauncy &s;aid to the world, "the divinely appointed way, in which per&s;ons <HI>become</HI> members of the vi&s;ible church of Chri&s;t, is utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;uppo&s;ition, that, in order to their being, &s;o, they mu&s;t be the &s;ubjects of <HI>&s;aving faith,</HI> or judged to be &s;o." According to which opinion, the fathers of New-England were the un|charitable men, for &s;everely examining into that matter, as much as the Newlights were for reviving that practice, or the Bapti&s;ts for per&s;evering therein; and it was an impo&s;ition upon mankind to bring that te&s;timony, to uphold a cau&s;e that was and is contrary thereto.</P>
<P>TRUTH and MERCY &s;hine with equal lu&s;tre, in the glo|rious kingdom of the Redeemer; and to his <HI>works</HI> of this nature he appeals, as his greate&s;t <HI>witne&s;&s;es</HI> again&s;t the pow|ers of darkne&s;s. John v. 36, 37. Their united influence convey the <HI>golden oil</HI> into the church, to make her the <HI>light of the world.</HI> Zech. iv. 2&mdash;14. The&s;e witne&s;&s;es have long prophe&s;ied in <HI>&s;ackcloth;</HI> till of late it &s;eems as if they had &s;carce any <HI>entrance</HI> into any admini&s;trations of civil govern|ment in the world, but rather to have <HI>fallen in the &s;treets,</HI> &s;o that he that <HI>departeth from evil maketh him&s;elf a prey.</HI> I&s;ai. lix. 14, 15. But when the <HI>&s;pirit of life from God &s;hall enter into them, the kingdoms of this world</HI> will &s;oon become <HI>the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his anointed;</HI> and <HI>the ark of his te&s;tament will be &s;een again.</HI> Rev. xi. 3&mdash;19.

And when the influence above de&s;cribed &s;hall extend &s;o far as to re&s;train tho&s;e who would <HI>hurt and de&s;troy,</HI> the &s;word will be entirely laid a&s;ide.

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE the foregoing pages were printed, I have &s;een a letter from a Bapti&s;t mini&s;ter in Penn&s;ylva|nia, who has lately been drawn into the opinion of the final re&s;toration of all creatures to happine&s;s; where|in it is laid down, as a rule to interpret &s;cripture by, that "whatever is to be known of God is <HI>manife&s;t within.</HI>" And his &s;entiments re&s;pecting the go&s;pel he delivers in the&s;e words, viz. "God in his written word declares him|&s;elf as the everla&s;ting e&s;&s;ential love: <HI>He that loveth not, knoweth not God; for God is love.</HI> If God be love, em|phatically &s;o, ab&s;tractedly &s;o, he can be nothing el&s;e; hence it nece&s;&s;arily follows, whatever he inflicts upon his creatures mu&s;t have its ri&s;e and &s;pring in love and in wi&s;dom, however &s;evere and terrible it may appear to the &s;hort-&s;ighted creature. If in love, it mu&s;t finally, center in <HI>their</HI> happine&s;s."</P>
<P>This &s;hews the weight of the apo&s;tle's &s;aying, <HI>I am jealous over you with a godly jealou&s;y; for I have e&s;pou&s;ed you to one bu&s;hand, that I may pre&s;ent you as a cha&s;te vir|gin to Chri&s;t. But I fear, le&s;t by any means, as the &s;erpent beguiled Eve through his &s;ubtilty, &s;o your minds &s;hould be corrupted from the</HI> SIMPLICITY <HI>that is in Chri&s;t.</HI> 2 Cor. xi. 2, 3. The tempter's argument with Eve was, that it could not be con&s;i&s;tent with <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>goodne&s;s</HI> to take God's <HI>&s;aying</HI> in its literal &s;en&s;e. And to &s;et up an inter|preter <HI>within man,</HI> which &s;hall con&s;true the <HI>written</HI> word in a &s;en&s;e, that mu&s;t finally center in the happine&s;s of all
<PB N="2" REF="017083_0038_0F9FC2481C9857D0">creatures, is making a regard <HI>to them</HI> the ultimate end of God's di&s;pen&s;ations; which is evidently a <HI>changing the truth of God into a lie.</HI> Rom. i. 25. See what is before &s;aid thereon, p. 4, 5, 15, 23. Chri&s;tianity is built upon the&s;e three points.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That God is &s;elf-moved in all his ac|tions, and that no higher rea&s;on can be given for his &s;hewing mercy to any, than becau&s;e <HI>&s;o it &s;eemed good in his &s;ight.</HI> Matt. xi. 26. Rom. ix. 8&mdash;23, and xi. 33&mdash;36.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That &s;in is an infinite evil, and can only be removed by the merits of God the Son, and by the renewing power of God the Holy Spirit.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That this &s;alvation mu&s;t take place upon the &s;oul in time, or not at all, p. 15. But my&s;tery Babylon was built by calling in hea|then philo&s;ophy, to con&s;true things in the oppo&s;ite way, p. 22, 23. And let it be covered ever &s;o artfully, I am bold in it, that to &s;uppo&s;e that God's choice is determined by what he &s;ees in the creature, and not in him&s;elf; and to hold &s;in to be but a finite evil, and that creature-&s;ufferings can remove it, is antichri&s;tiani&s;m. And the fruits of it always &s;hew the propriety of that remark; <HI>he that loveth not his brother whom he hath &s;een, how can be love God whom he hath not &s;een?</HI> 1 John, iv. 20. And a temper contrary to equity has ever been di&s;covered in all &s;orts of men, who have been unwilling to let the <HI>written</HI> laws of Chri&s;t be their own interpret|ers; but have &s;et up any thing <HI>within man</HI> above them. One candle&s;tick was an emblem of the church which &s;prang from the twelve patriarchs; and two were &s;o, of the church that was con&s;tituted by the mini&s;try of the twelve apo&s;tles, from among both Jews and Gentiles. Zech. iv. 2&mdash;14. Eph. ii. 18&mdash;20. Rev. xi. 4. This church which is built upon, and governed by, the <HI>writ|ings</HI> of the <HI>apo&s;tles</HI> and <HI>prophets,</HI> I believe is intended by the twenty-four <HI>elders,</HI> and its mini&s;ters by the <HI>four bea&s;ts or living creatures,</HI> who unite in high prai&s;es to God for
<PB N="3" REF="017083_0039_0F9FC248B54A8C30">the di&s;plays of <HI>redeeming</HI> grace to them, and of righteous judgments towards the impenitent. Ezek. i. 19&mdash;21, Rev. iv. 4&mdash;11, and v. 9, and vii. 11&mdash;14, and xi. 16, 17, and xix. 4. And the di&s;plays of TRUTH and EQUITY which the Redeemer makes in all the&s;e <HI>works,</HI> I take to be the <HI>two witne&s;&s;es</HI> &s;poken of in Rev. xi. 3&mdash;12. And when a full victory &s;hall be gained over the bea&s;t, the church will &s;ing the &s;ong of Mo&s;es, lawgiver to the Jewi&s;h church, and of the Lamb, who is lawgiver to the Chri&s;tian church. Acts iii. 22, 23. Rev. xv. 2, 3. And what follows, contains a demon&s;tration of the impo&s;&s;ibility of uniting truth and equity with the exerci&s;e of a legi&s;lative and executive power in civil States, as to the affairs of divine wor&s;hip.</ITEM>

<P>ON reading the memorial of Rev. I&s;aac Backus, agent to the Bapti&s;t churches in this government,</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, That the e&s;tabli&s;hment of civil and reli|gious liberty, to each denomination in the Province, is the &s;incere wi&s;h of this Congre&s;s: But being by no means ve&s;ted with powers of civil government, whereby they can redre&s;s the grievances of any per&s;on whatever, they therefore recommend to the Bapti&s;t churches, that when a General A&s;&s;embly &s;hall be con|vened in this Colony, they lay the real grievances of &s;aid churches before the &s;ame; when and where their petition will mo&s;t certainly meet with all that attention, due to the memorial of a denomination of Chri&s;tians &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed to the public weal of their country.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>By order of the Congre&s;s, JOHN HANCOCK, Pre&s;ident. A true extract from the minutes, BENJAMIN LINCOLN, Sec'ry.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Accordingly we laid our ca&s;e before the A&s;&s;embly, which met at Watertown, September 20, 1775, to whom we &s;aid, "we humbly repre&s;ent that our real grievances are, that we, as well as our fathers, have from time to time been taxed on religious accounts where we are not repre&s;ented, and when we have &s;ued for our rights, our cau&s;es have been tried by intere&s;ted judges."
<PB N="5" REF="017083_0041_0F9FC24CE87EF950">Which we went on plainly to prove; and toward the clo&s;e &s;aid, "as we are per&s;uaded that an entire freedom from being taxed by <HI>civil</HI> rulers to <HI>religious</HI> wor&s;hip, is not a mere favour from any man or men in the world, but a right and property granted us by God, who com|mands us to <HI>&s;tand fa&s;t in it;</HI> we have not only the &s;ame rea&s;on to refu&s;e an acknowledgment of &s;uch a taxing power here, as America has the taxing power of the Briti&s;h Parliament; but al&s;o, according to our pre&s;ent light, we &s;hould wrong our con&s;ciences, in allowing that power to man, which we believe belongs only to God." This memorial was read at three different times in the A&s;|&s;embly, and then liberty was granted for one of our bre|thren who belonged to it to bring in &s;uch a bill as he want|ed to have pa&s;&s;ed in our favour. He did &s;o, and it was read once, and a time was &s;et for a &s;econd reading; but when that time came, other things were crowded in, and nothing more was ever done upon it, as we know of. And when the third article, now in que&s;tion, came to be acted upon in the Convention, tho&s;e old accu&s;ations, about the de&s;ign of my going to Philadelphia, were again brought up to prejudice the Convention again&s;t all that the Bapti&s;t members could &s;ay for equal liberty. Being well informed of this inju&s;tice &s;oon after, I publi&s;h|ed a brief &s;tate of the affair on Dec. 2, 1779, wherein I named our accu&s;ers, and challenged them to a fair hearing thereon; but have been denied it to this day. And Lieut. Elijah Ames, as hearty a friend to the American cau&s;e as any man in Bridgwater, with his brother Jo&s;eph, two baptized members of our church, were impri&s;oned for a mini&s;terial tax, on the day that my challenge was printed in Bo&s;ton; and two other of my hearers were fined for refu&s;ing to a&s;&s;i&s;t the collector in that iniquitous act. And on March 27, 1780, a cow was taken from Oliver Wetherbee, for a tax to a
<PB N="6" REF="017083_0042_0F9FC24D45434E28">mini&s;ter he never had any connexion with; being a baptized member of our &s;i&s;ter church in Harvard, be|fore he removed into Lanca&s;ter, and &s;till walked in fel|low&s;hip therewith. The cow was the property of one of his brethren, who took lawful methods to recover her, and got her into his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but a band of men came and violently wre&s;ted her from him, and threaten|ed to <HI>kill</HI> any Bapti&s;ts that &s;hould attempt to take her again. But as Worce&s;ter Court gave judgment that the owner &s;hould be paid for his cow, Jonathan Ken|dell, the collector, aided by Capt. Ha&s;kal, who had be|fore threatened life, &s;eized brother Wetherbee on June 26; and though there was no appearance of any de&s;ign to re&s;cue him, yet he was conducted into Worce&s;ter gaol by a <HI>drawn &s;word.</HI> John Hawkes was al&s;o a bap|tized member of the &s;ame church, before he removed into Lanca&s;ter, and had done near four years &s;ervice in this war; yet he, with Nathan Willard, one of that &s;ociety, were &s;eized on April 11, for taxes to the &s;ame mini&s;ter, and all three of them were confined at Worce&s;ter till September. And the teachers and lawyers who oppo&s;e our claims of liberty, di&s;covered no more <HI>compa&s;&s;ion</HI> to them, than the prie&s;t and levite did to the man who fell among thieves. All civil officers, who received their power in the name of the Kings of Britain, long &s;ince quitted the exerci&s;e of it among us; but each of the&s;e brethren were impri&s;oned for the &s;upport of mini&s;ters who received their pari&s;h power in that name; and is not this a being <HI>partial in the law?</HI> Mal. ii. 9. In&s;tead of <HI>equal</HI> protection, great numbers in our State are now daily expo&s;ed to &s;poiling of goods or impri&s;on|ment, for the &s;upport of teachers they never cho&s;e; one of whom is Mr. Eleazer Snow, of Bridgwater, who was baptized in September, 1761, and has walked in fellow&s;hip with our church ever &s;ince, being now
<PB N="7" REF="017083_0043_0F9FC24E0723ED38">within three months of four&s;core years of age; yet a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> has lately been demanded of him, for a young teacher, from whom he never heard a &s;ingle &s;ermon.</P>
<P>I am not in&s;en&s;ible of the prejudices of many again&s;t hearing any thing from me upon the&s;e matters; therefore I &s;hall clo&s;e at this time with a brief view of the rea&s;ons of the pre&s;ent publication. Mini&s;ters have told us that we were initiated into the covenant of grace in infancy; but forty years ago this month, the holy &s;pirit took me in hand, and effectually taught me, that I was under the covenant of works, and in Augu&s;t following he brought me into the covenant of grace, by giving my &s;oul &s;uch a revelation of the glory and excellency of the way of &s;alvation by the Redeemer, as drew my heart gladly to quit all confidence in the fle&s;h, that I might win Chri&s;t, and be found in him. Yet I was &s;uch a dull &s;cholar in his &s;chool, that it took thirty-two years to learn me this &s;hort le&s;&s;on; <HI>one Lord, one faith, one bapti&s;m.</HI> It was ten years before I came to &s;ee, that what men call bapti&s;m, which they have put before faith, is a <HI>nullity;</HI> and it took four more to bring me to refrain from communing with that <HI>nullity</HI> at the Lord's table. Af|ter which it co&s;t the farther di&s;cipline of eighteen years to learn me &s;o much as to treat all laws about wor&s;hip as <HI>nullities,</HI> which come not from the <HI>one Lord.</HI> And his authority upon my con&s;cience has con&s;trained me, to improve what gifts and influence he has been plea&s;ed to give me, in attempts to propagate this le&s;&s;on among my country men, it being the only way to obtain and keep the <HI>unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</HI> Eph. iv. 1&mdash;6, xv. 25. The <HI>covenant of circunci&s;ion</HI> gave I&s;rael a right to make &s;laves of &s;uch as were not in it; and the <HI>taking away</HI> that name which God gave to it (Acts vii. 8) and <HI>adding</HI> a name to it which he never gave, is the very way that the <HI>mother of harlots</HI> has taken
<PB N="8" REF="017083_0044_0F9FC24F4AFE5C90">to make <HI>merchandize of &s;laves and &s;ouls of men.</HI> And the call from HEAVEN is, <HI>Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her &s;ins, and that ye receive not of her plagues. For her &s;ins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.</HI> Rev. xviii. 4, 5, 13, 20&mdash;24. If this call be duly regarded, we are <HI>well able</HI> to overcome every foe, and to go in and po&s;&s;e&s;s' all the ble&s;&s;ings promi&s;ed in the go&s;pel.
