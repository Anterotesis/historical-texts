<P>That they &s;hould &s;eek the LORD, if haply they might feel after him, and find him.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>BEFORE we can undertake to determine the proper u&s;e and improvement of the principles of Natural Religion, we mu&s;t know what Natural Religion is, and what tho&s;e principles are, which we are to u&s;e and improve.</P>
<P>It was ju&s;tly ob&s;erved by one <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. GAY</NOTE> who hath gone before me on this &s;ubject, that "the belief of God's exi&s;tence is mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially fundamental to all religion."&mdash;If we could &s;uppo&s;e an intel|ligent creature to do every thing that we call right, and to forbear what we call evil; yet, if he did not act from a &s;en&s;e of the Being and Perfections of God, we &s;hould not pronounce this religion, whatever el&s;e we might call it.</P>
<P>It is the opinion of many great and good men, that there is an e&s;&s;ential and immutable difference between moral good and evil; and
<PB N="vi" REF="012033_0004_0F8971840DB75E28">that this difference ari&s;es from the very nature of things, &s;o as to be entirely independent on the will of God. I &s;hall not determine whether the&s;e &s;entiments are true or fal&s;e but allowing that they are true, and that &s;ome &s;uperior minds are influenced by this ab&s;tract and unalterable fitne&s;s of things to act agreable to it, without any other con&s;ideration; we may call them wi&s;e and virtuous; but if there is no regard to a Deity, they cannot be denominated religious, becau&s;e a re&s;pect to a Deity is nece&s;&s;arily im|plied in the very notion of Religion&mdash;If there is no God, there is, there can be no Religion&mdash; The &s;acred writings lay this down as a funda|mental principle, "He that cometh to God mu&s;t believe that He is"&mdash;This is the foundation of all Religion both Natural and Revealed.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t thing therefore in di&s;cour&s;ing on Natural Religion is to e&s;tabli&s;h this great, this fundamental, this e&s;&s;ential truth&mdash;That there is a God.</P>
<P>ALLOWING the Being and Perfections of God, we are next to prove that there is &s;uch a thing as Religion.</P>
<P>IN the la&s;t place we &s;hall &s;how in what re|&s;pects this Religion may be called Natural or the Religion of Nature.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="012033_0005_0F897184C823E490">
THE fir&s;t thing before us is, to prove the Being of a God, or that there is a Deity of in|finite perfection&mdash;I &s;hall not take up much of your time upon this head, as I am not able to offer any arguments, but &s;uch as will ea&s;ily occur to your minds without any help of mine.</P>
<P>"The high priori road" is, I fear, too intricate for men of common under&s;tanding, either when they attempt to find it out them&s;elves, or to tra|vel in it when di&s;covered by others&mdash;The&s;e ex|alted rea&s;onings become men of &s;uch prodigious reach of thought as the late Dr. Clark, but even with the help of this clear and con&s;um|mate Rea&s;oner, the mo&s;t are rather puzzled and confounded, than enlightned and e&s;tabli&s;hed by &s;uch ab&s;tract &s;peculations&mdash;"The argument a po&s;teriori", &s;ays that very great man, "is indeed by far the mo&s;t generally u&s;eful argument, mo&s;t ea&s;y to be under&s;tood, and in &s;ome degree &s;uited to all capacities".</P>
<P>THAT every Effect mu&s;t have &s;ome cau&s;e is as plain and undeniable a truth as any axiom in Euclid. That the whole &s;en&s;ible univer&s;e is an Effect, we have all the evidence that the nature of the thing will admit. If it is not the effect of &s;ome cau&s;e, it mu&s;t exi&s;t from Eternity: Now, &s;ays Dr. Clark, "whatever exi&s;ts from Eternity and
<PB N="viii" REF="012033_0006_0F89718574EE6658">without any external cau&s;e, is &s;elf-exi&s;tent: What|ever is &s;elf-exi&s;tent, mu&s;t exi&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, by an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity in the nature of the thing it&s;elf. It follows evidently, that unle&s;s the material world exi&s;ts nece&s;&s;arily, by an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity in its own nature, &s;o as that it mu&s;t be an expre&s;s contradiction to &s;uppo&s;e it not to exi&s;t; it cannot be independent, and of it&s;elf eternal. Now that the materi|al world doth not exi&s;t thus nece&s;&s;arily, is ve|ry evident. For ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of exi&s;ting, and a po&s;&s;ibility of not exi&s;ting, being contradic|tory ideas; it is manife&s;t the material world can|not exi&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, if without a contradiction we can conceive it either not to be, or to be in any re&s;pect, otherwi&s;e than it now is. Than which, nothing is more ea&s;y. Every thing in it, both the whole and every one of its parts, their &s;itu|ation and motion, the form and al&s;o the matter, are the mo&s;t arbitrary and dependent things, and farthe&s;t removed from nece&s;&s;ity, that can po&s;|&s;ibly be imagined". We rationally conclude therefore that the univer&s;e is the effect of &s;ome powerful cau&s;e.</P>
<P>THE &s;tructure and con&s;titution of the world, the accurate adju&s;tment of its various parts, and the u&s;es and ends to which they are mutually adapted, prove this cau&s;e to be intelligent, wi&s;e and good.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="012033_0007_0F89718639004130">
THE two fir&s;t of the&s;e attributes, I conclude, will readily be allowed. Po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome may di&s;pute, whether the Goodne&s;s of God can be ju&s;tly argued from the &s;tate of things in this world, where there is &s;uch a mixture of &s;orrow, di&s;tre&s;s and mi&s;ery. But there is certainly a large &s;hare of good com|municated, enough to preponderate the evil there is in the univer&s;e, &s;o far as it is known to us, and even if we leave out all con&s;ideration of a future &s;tate. The mo&s;t enjoy a great degree of comfort, and would enjoy much more, were it not for their own irregular pa&s;&s;ions, and the faults and follies which are the con&s;equence of them. As bad as things are, there are very few, who are reduced to &s;uch a &s;tate of extreme mi&s;ery, as to be willing to exchange it for a &s;tate of non-exi&s;tence, if this were in their pow|er. Who then can rea&s;onably di&s;pute the good|ne&s;s of God? e&s;pecially when we con&s;ider, that &s;o great and wi&s;e a Being as God is, hath with|out doubt a large and exten&s;ive plan; and po&s;&s;ibly, at the winding up of the drama, tho&s;e things which are at pre&s;ent dark, may have a quite contrary a&s;pect.</P>
<P>IT would not be difficult to prove the other moral perfections of the Deity, by arguments fetched from tho&s;e we have mentioned; or per|haps, though we are obliged to think and &s;peak
<PB N="x" REF="012033_0008_0F897186F627F3E0">of them as di&s;tinct attributes in God, there is but one principle of action in him; all may be reduced to boundle&s;s intelligence or wi&s;dom; or, as Mr. Wolla&s;ton calls it, "Divine Rea&s;on, which, as it exerts it&s;elf upon this or that occa&s;ion, is by us variou&s;ly denominated" Ju&s;tice, Mercy, Truth, or whatever el&s;e goes to con&s;titute moral perfection, or perfect moral conduct. An infi|nitely pure Being mu&s;t always propo&s;e to him&s;elf the be&s;t end in acting, and mu&s;t know what are the be&s;t means to accompli&s;h that end; He can have no temptation to act contrary to what his wi&s;dom dictates; He cannot be under any undue influence, either from prejudice within, or deceit without; and if this allwi&s;e Being is al&s;o infinite in power, He mu&s;t be an object of the highe&s;t confidence, or the greate&s;t fear; according as we have rea&s;on to think, He is our friend or our enemy; engaged to promote our happine&s;s, or determined to make us mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>To &s;ay that God has exerted his power or his wi&s;dom, ad ultimum po&s;&s;e, &s;o that He can proceed no farther, is to &s;ay a great deal too much: But we may with rea&s;on a&s;&s;ert, that he has di&s;covered infinite wi&s;dom and infinite pow|er; or in other words, that none but a Being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the&s;e perfections in the highe&s;t po&s;&s;i|ble
<PB N="xi" REF="012033_0009_0F897187B620DF60">degree could have created this &s;tupendous univer&s;e. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"The arrangement nece&s;&s;ary, for the production of the &s;malle&s;t plant, requires in the cau&s;e a degree of power, in|telligence and wi&s;dom, which infinitely tran&s;cends the &s;ubli|me&s;t exertions of human ability. What then &s;hall we &s;ay of the chu&s;e that produces an animal, a rational &s;oul, a world, a &s;y&s;tem of worlds, an univer&s;e? &s;hall we &s;ay, that infinite pow|er and wi&s;dom are not nece&s;&s;ary attributes, of that univer&s;al cau&s;e, though they be nece&s;&s;ary attributes of the cau&s;e that pre|duces a plant"? Profe&s;&s;or Beattie's e&s;&s;ay on thenature and im|mutability of truth in oppo&s;ition to for hi&s;try and &s;ceptici&s;m.</NOTE></P>
<P>THAT we do not di&s;cern more wi&s;dom, pow|er and goodne&s;s in the works of God, is not owing to any defect in them, but in us. The more we &s;tudy and know of them, the more do we &s;ee of the&s;e perfections in their production. This is true not only of men who&s;e capacities are weak, and who have but &s;mall advantages to &s;earch out the works of God, it is equally true of men of the mo&s;t &s;ublime genius, who have the be&s;t opportunities to look into nature and to inquire after truth. The effect of their in|quiries is, a deeper &s;en&s;e of their own igno|rance, and a more exalted thought of the Divine Excellence. This would be the ca&s;e, if we &s;hould contemplate the works of God through numberle&s;s ages, even to eternity. The rea&s;on we do not di&s;cern Infinite Perfection in the works of God, is, becau&s;e we cannot comprehend In|finity.
<PB N="xii" REF="012033_0010_0F897188755CC828">The Apo&s;tle &s;peaking of the heathen &s;ays, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Rom. 20.</NOTE> "The invi&s;ible things of God from," or ever &s;ince, "the creation of the world, are clearly &s;een, being under&s;tood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and godhead, &s;o that they are without excu&s;e". His eternal power and godhead are under&s;tood by the things that are made, &s;o far as they are under&s;tood; men are capable of under&s;tanding, of forming right conceptions of the nature and perfections of God from the things which He has made, if they duly con&s;ider and attend to them. But though we might form right conceptions of Him by an attentive con&s;ideration of his works, yet this great and glorious being can never be comprehended by a finite mind.</P>
<P>THE evidence of the Being and Perfections of God from his works, is not only conclu&s;ive, but clear and level to the meane&s;t capacity. It &s;trikes the mind with conviction, almo&s;t as &s;oon as it is propo&s;ed. The rude&s;t barbarian, is no &s;ooner put upon thinking and reflecting, than he feels the ab&s;urdity of &s;uppo&s;ing, that he him&s;elf and evey thing around him, were produced by chance, that is by nothing, a mere non-entity, that they were effects without a cau&s;e. He a&s;&s;ents to the exi&s;tence of &s;ome powerful and
<PB N="xiii" REF="012033_0011_0F8971893441F9B8">de&s;igning mind, who made and pre&s;erveth all things; and the more he looks into him&s;elf, contemplates the curious workman&s;hip of his bo|dy, the nature of the human &s;oul, and the &s;ur|prizing union which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between the&s;e two very different &s;ub&s;tances, &s;o much the more &s;a|tisfied he is that the conclu&s;ion is ju&s;t. While he looks abroad and &s;urveys the univer&s;e, wonders of wi&s;dom and power multiply upon him, and his faith continually gathers &s;trength. Evident marks of the&s;e Divine Perfections are to be &s;een in the adju&s;tment of tho&s;e va&s;t heavenly bodies, which pre&s;ent them&s;elves to the wondring &s;ight. With what exact order, harmony and beauty do they perform their &s;everal revolutions, and di&s;|charge their appointed functions! Or if we only traver&s;e the globe on which we dwell, and ob|&s;erve, how it is variegated with hills, valleys, plains, rivers, &s;eas, which all have their particu|lar u&s;e; the tribes of different animals with which it is &s;tocked; the &s;urprizing variety of trees, plants, and vegetables with which every part abounds, new &s;cenes perpetually opening to the enquiring mind, it is impo&s;&s;ible to doubt, the couclu&s;ion is irre&s;i&s;tible, that there is One, and only One, great and adequate cau&s;e of all, and that this cau&s;e is God. There needs only common &s;en&s;e and under&s;tanding to make this deduction&mdash;But there is this peculiar advantage
<PB N="xiv" REF="012033_0012_0F897189F3E66850">attending this argument, that the more clo&s;ely we examine the con&s;titution of the univer&s;e, and the greater di&s;coveries we make of the works and laws of nature, the rea&s;oning from them grows &s;tronger and approaches nearer to demon|&s;tration&mdash;A &s;ure evidence that it is founded in truth.</P>
<P>THE Being and Perfections of God being once e&s;tabli&s;hed, it is not hard to prove that there is &s;uch a thing as Religion&mdash;when I &s;ay there is &s;uch a thing as Religion, I intend, that there are duties incumbent on man towards the Deity, which God hath a right to require of us, and which we are under obligations to perform. I ob&s;erved in the beginning of the di&s;cour&s;e, that the very notion of Religion implies a regard to God: If we &s;hould allow that moral good and evil do not depend on the will of God, yet there is nothing of religion in the be&s;t action, unle&s;s we have re&s;pect to God in doing it, unle&s;s we do it becau&s;e it is conformable to his will. God is a Being of infinite excellency, the foun|tain of under&s;tanding and wi&s;dom; all creatures, received their being from Him, and depend con|&s;tantly upon Him; they derive from his goodne&s;s all the benefits of which they partake, and it is He only that can &s;upply their wants, or &s;atisfy their de&s;ires. On the&s;e accounts He has an ab|&s;olute
<PB N="xv" REF="012033_0013_0F89718B7B068CC8">right of government, and it is the duty of the whole intelligent world to obey, &s;erve and honor Him.</P>
<P>GOD, having given us our re&s;pective capaci|ties, and placed us in &s;uch particular circum&s;tan|ces and relations, has hereby intimated to us, that it is his will we &s;hould act agreably to them. A wi&s;e and good Being would not have confer|red the&s;e capacities, and con&s;tituted the&s;e relati|ons, without &s;ome wi&s;e and good de&s;ign; and what de&s;ign could He have, but to point out to them that method of conduct, which would be proper for them, and agreable to Him? And what makes it quite evident, that this was his de&s;ign, is, that while we act agreably to the circum&s;tan|ces in which He hath placed us, we promote our own felicity, whereas a contrary conduct tends to bring mi&s;ery on our &s;elves, and to in|troduce di&s;order into the world. This therefore is the con&s;titution of nature, or rather of the God of nature, from whence ari&s;es fitne&s;s and obligation.</P>
<P>IT is fit and right that we &s;hould act in con|formity to the will of an all perfect Being, who&s;e will is rectitude it&s;elf, and who requires nothing of us, but what tends to make us like him&s;elf, who is the &s;tandard of excellence. And to act other|wi&s;e is wrong.</P>
<P><PB N="xvi" REF="012033_0014_0F89718C7070A668">
IF it be a&s;ked; what is it that makes this con|formity a duty? may we not as well enquire why two and two make four? why one quan|tity is greater than another? The under&s;tanding determines both. If men are &s;ceptical in the&s;e points, arguments will not cure them. A long &s;eries of rea&s;oning will not make it clearer, af|ter all, the mind is no more &s;atisfied, and we are obliged often to return to the point from whence we fir&s;t &s;et out. Right in this ca&s;e is a kind of &s;imple perception. Rea&s;on and con&s;ci|ence dictate that God is to be obeyed&mdash;We feel their authority. To renounce it is to offer vio|lence to our under&s;tanding&mdash;"Right implies duty in its idea. To perceive that an action is right, is to &s;ee a rea&s;on for doing it. Now, this per|ception, this acknowledged rectitude in the ac|tion, is the very e&s;&s;ence of obligation; that which commands the approbation and choice, and binds the con&s;cience of every rational be|ing". A creature to whom his Creator has grant|ed the powers of rea&s;on and reflection, if he doth not improve the&s;e powers, or act agreably to the dictates of rea&s;on, doth not act as the being he is; he rebels again&s;t his Sovereign and Lord, and doth what he can, to defeat the de&s;ign of Hea|ven in bringing him into exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>THERE are a variety of ways in which God may make known his will to us; whatever way He
<PB N="xvii" REF="012033_0015_0F89718CF4B73188">choo&s;es, the obligation is the &s;ame, it is our du|ty to act in conformity to it. He who made us and conferred &s;o many benefits upon us, hath an unlimited right to our homage and obedi|ence; as it is quite certain, that a Being of &s;uch ab&s;olute rectitude can never require any thing, which is not agreable to his own perfect nature, or in other words, which is not right and fit.</P>
<P>IT cannot be indifferent to this All-perfect Mind, whether his creatures act agreably to his will or not. "The righteous Lord loveth righteou&s;ne&s;s". The &s;ame rectitude, which in|fluences his will and directs his requirements from his creatures, nece&s;&s;arily cau&s;es Him to be plea&s;ed when they do right, and di&s;plea&s;ed when they do wrong. And being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of uncon|trolable power, it is rea&s;onable to conclude, that He will evidence his approbation and di&s;like, by rewarding tho&s;e who do his will, and puni&s;h|ing tho&s;e who do it not. This is what we call his moral government, which is his rendering to men according to their actions, whether they be good or evil. Something of this we &s;ee in this life, in the tendency which moral piety hath to produce happine&s;s; and in the evils which are often con&s;equent on our acting contrary to the nature and will of God. 'Tis true, in the pre|&s;ent &s;tate, this di&s;tinction is not uniformly and
<PB N="xviii" REF="012033_0016_0F89718DB525D5C0">con&s;tantly maintained, according to men's moral or religious conduct. There is frequently a pro|mi&s;cuous di&s;pen&s;ation of things, without any ap|parent regard to the merit or demerit of charac|ters. Virtue and goodne&s;s fail of their proper ge|nuine effect; while vice and wickedne&s;s not only e&s;cape the puni&s;hment, which the general nature and di&s;po&s;ition of things would lead us to ex|pect, but &s;eem to triumph and pro&s;per. From this view of things, it is a ju&s;t and unavoidable conclu&s;ion, that there will be a future &s;tate, when the perfection of God's moral government will be di&s;played; all the pre&s;ent inequalities will be &s;et to rights; and He will appear to be holy, wi&s;e and good, beyond all di&s;pute and contra|diction.</P>
<P>THE whole of this rea&s;oning is founded on the &s;uppo&s;ition that man acts freely; and upon any other &s;uppo&s;ition, it is idle to talk of moral go|vernment, of rewards and puni&s;hments, or in|deed of religion or virtue. "That", &s;ays Mr. Wolla&s;ton, "which hath not the opportunity or liberty of chu&s;ing for it&s;elf, and acting accord|ingly, from an internal principle, acts, if it acts at all, under a nece&s;&s;ity incumbent ab extra. But that, which acts thus, is in reality only an in|&s;trument in the hand of &s;omething which impo|&s;es the nece&s;&s;ity; and cannot properly be &s;aid
<PB N="xix" REF="012033_0017_0F89718E76F07BD0">to act, but to be acted. The act mu&s;t be the act of an agent, therefore not of his in&s;trument. A Being under the above-mentioned inabilities is, as to the morality of its acts, in the &s;tate of inert and pa&s;&s;ive matter, and can be but a machine; to which no language or philo&s;ophy ever a&s;crib|ed morals". <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"What is moral agency, and what is implied in it? This at lea&s;t mu&s;t be implied in it, that we ought to do &s;ome things, and not to do others. But if every intention and action of my life is fixed by eternal laws, which I can neither elude nor alter, it is as ab&s;urd to &s;ay to me, you ought to be hone&s;t to morrow, as to &s;ay, you ought to &s;top the nature of the planets to mor|row. Unle&s;s &s;ome events depend on my determination, ought, and ought not, have no meaning when applied to me. Moral agency further implies, that we are accountable for our conduct, and that if we do what we ought not to do, we de&s;erve blame and puni&s;hment. My con&s;cience tells me, that I am accountable for tho&s;e actions only that are in my own power; and neither blames nor approves, in my&s;elf and in others, that conduct which is the effect, not of choice, but of nece&s;&s;ity. Convince me that all my actions are equally nece&s;&s;ary, and you &s;ilence my con&s;cience for ever, or at lea&s;t prove it to be a fallacious and impertinent monitor: You will then convince me that all circum&s;pection is unnece&s;&s;ary, and all remor&s;e ab|&s;urd." Profe&s;&s;or BEATTIL's e&s;&s;ay on truth.</NOTE> The &s;cheme of nece&s;&s;ity in the actions of an intelligent being, or that all our volitions, determinations and actions proceed from God, as infru&s;trable effects from their proper cau&s;e, hath hitherto been embraced by a very few, except in&s;idels, and tho&s;e of the mo&s;t ma|lignant cla&s;s, who have very con&s;i&s;tently given up the doctrine of future puni&s;hment. In this they
<PB N="xx" REF="012033_0018_0F89718F35E16178">di&s;cover that they have more ju&s;t and honorary thoughts of God, than tho&s;e Chri&s;tians, who fir&s;t make God the author of &s;in, and then repre&s;ent him as inflicting eternal puni&s;hment on men for it; for that which is originally, and in &s;trict con&s;truc|tion his own act. Mr. Howe calls it, "a black conception of God, that He &s;hould be &s;uppo&s;ed irre&s;i&s;tibly to determine the will of man to the hatred of his own mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed &s;elf, and then to exact the &s;evere&s;t puni&s;hments for the offence done. "We &s;hould rather chu&s;e", &s;ays he, "to have our &s;ight, hearing, and motive power, or what not be&s;ides, di&s;puted or even torn away from us, than ever &s;uffer our&s;elves to be di&s;puted in to a belief, that the holy and good God &s;hould irre&s;i&s;tibly determine the wills of men to, and puni&s;h the &s;ame thing".</P>
<P>IT is a conclu&s;ive argument again&s;t &s;uch a fatal nece&s;&s;ity as &s;ome men plead for, that it is contrary to the perceptions of the human mind,&mdash;we have a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of liberty, we perceive no external influence, we have a moral &s;en&s;e, we pa&s;s a judgment on our own actions, approve or di&s;approve our &s;elves and others. It &s;hows the difficulty, to which a very &s;en&s;ible writer <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ays on the principles of morality and natural religion.</NOTE> of the pre&s;ent day is reduced, who al|lows this inward perception, that we are nece&s;&s;i|tated
<PB N="xxi" REF="012033_0019_0F89718FF5F57618">to think our&s;elves and others free; and yet denies the reality of liberty. God has, according to him implanted a delu&s;ive &s;en&s;e in us, our feel|ing is deceitful, the God of truth doth continu|ally by a po&s;itive influence deceive and delude us. What &s;trange notions have &s;ome men of that glorious Being, all who&s;e ways are truth, and who is righteous altogether! Is it not better to &s;et limits to our enquiries, and to &s;uppo&s;e there may be a mi&s;take in &s;ome curious &s;peculations, than to entertain &s;entiments &s;o di&s;honorable to God, and &s;o intirely &s;ubver&s;ive of all moral go|vernment? I admire the mode&s;ty, as well as goodne&s;s of heart, di&s;covered by the great Mr. Locke, in one of his Letters to Mr. Molineux, "I freely own" &s;ays he, "the weakne&s;s of my un|der&s;tanding, that though it be unque&s;tionable, that there is Omnipotence and Omni&s;cience in God our Maker, and I cannot have a clearer per|ception of any thing, than that I am free; yet I cannot make freedom in man con&s;i&s;tent with Omnipotence and Omni&s;cience in God, though I am as fully per&s;uaded of both, as of any truths I mo&s;t firmly a&s;&s;ent to, and therefore I have long &s;ince left off the con&s;ideration of the que&s;tion". <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lock's works Vol 3. page 527.</NOTE></P>
<P>IF &s;ome of our modern rea&s;oners, who have not a tenth part of his under&s;tanding, had a little more of his humility, the world would be free
<PB N="xxii" REF="012033_0020_0F897190B5920128">from tho&s;e angry di&s;putes about fate and free-will, liberty and nece&s;&s;ity, which puzzle the heads, but &s;eldom mend the hearts, of tho&s;e who engage in them.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid&mdash;There is a God&mdash;That there is Reli|gion&mdash;I am now to con&s;ider in what &s;en&s;e this Religion is called Natural. And it is thus denomi|nated, not becau&s;e men di&s;cover it in the &s;ole exerci&s;e of their natural faculties and powers; but becau&s;e it hath its foundation in the Perfections of God, and in that con&s;titution of nature which he has e&s;tabli&s;hed, or which ari&s;es from the mutual relation between God and His creature Man. God having made us the beings we are, intelli|gent rational creatures, and having fixed our par|ticular &s;ituation, there ari&s;e certain fitne&s;&s;es and obligations, which con&s;titute the law of our na|ture. This is the law of Him who is the author of our being; to act agreable to that, is therefore to obey God, which con&s;titutes it Religion. And to obey a law, which re&s;ults, not from the po&s;itive will of God, but from the nature He hath given to man, is to him natural religion. This religion is immutably the &s;ame, the law of our nature can never cea&s;e to oblige, nor can it ever be right to act in contradiction to it. "The nature of God is unchangeable, the original relations wherein we &s;tand in to Him are al&s;o unchangeable, and the
<PB N="xxiii" REF="012033_0021_0F8971917493DE90">duties thence re&s;ulting are &s;till owing to Him, and ever will be. Man mu&s;t ever be bound to own his glorious perfections, to pay Him venera|tion love and prai&s;e, on account of them, and to endeavor after a re&s;emblance to Him in his moral excellencies". Having received our being from God, and entirely depending upon Him, we are bound to own Him as Maker, Pre&s;erver; Lord and Ruler; to make the utmo&s;t returns of gratitude and love; to pray to Him for what we want, to prai&s;e Him for what we enjoy; to commit our&s;elves and our affairs to his di&s;|po&s;al; to be re&s;igned to his will, &s;ubmit to His government, and yield obedience to his com|mands, whenever, and however, He is plea&s;ed to &s;ignify his mind to us. The&s;e duties ari&s;e from the nece&s;&s;ary relations between a Creator and a creature; between a being who is conti|nually conferring benefits, and one who is as con&s;tantly receiving them.</P>
<P>THE Religion of Nature, doth not depend on the conceptions we may form of God, or the apprehen&s;ions we have of our duty to Him. Men may have very fal&s;e and unworthy notions of a Deity, they may make many mi&s;takes in religi|on, or about the duties which God requires of them. But the mi&s;takes they make do not alter he nature of things. God is the &s;ame, whe|ther
<PB N="xxiv" REF="012033_0022_0F897192361B6120">we conceive aright of Him or not: Reli|gion is the &s;ame, whether we form ju&s;t notions of it or not: The obligations we are under to obey God are the &s;ame, whether we obey Him or not.</P>
<P>THE Chri&s;tian Religion is contained in the book we call the Bible; it remains the &s;ame whether men attend to it or not, whether they under|&s;tand it or not, whether they act agreably to it or not. The Bible is the &s;tandard; the rule to which Chri&s;tians are to appeal, in all differ|ences of opinion and practice. In like manner, the religion of nature is written in the book of nature, in the works of God; man may read there the being and perfections of God. "The heavens declare the glory of God; and the fir|mament &s;heweth his handy work; day unto day uttereth &s;peech; and night unto night &s;heweth knowlege; there is no &s;peech nor language where their voice is not heard". The truths which the heavens declare are always the &s;ame, the religion they teach doth not alter and change according to our apprehen&s;ions and prejudices; it is quite independent of our notions and per|ceptions; and remains &s;teady and permanent, whether we attend to it or not. Indeed, every thing in religion, which approves it&s;elf to the unprejudiced rea&s;on of man, is undoubtedly a part
<PB N="xxv" REF="012033_0023_0F897192F3EE1140">of natural religion; but there is &s;uch a thing as truth and duty, whether they are di&s;covered to us or not, whether our rea&s;on is exerci&s;ed about them or not. This religion, which is taught by the natural order and con&s;titution of things, all men are ca|pable in &s;ome degree of knowing, of embrac|ing and practicing. "The Gentiles which have not the law, are a law unto them&s;elves, which &s;hew the work of the law written in their hearts, their con&s;cience al&s;o bearing witne&s;s, and their thoughts the mean while accu&s;ing or el&s;e excu&s;ing one another". <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Rom. 14, 15.</NOTE> What the apo&s;tle Paul evident|ly intends, is, that all intelligent creatures are &s;ubjects of law; that rea&s;on implies duty; that man hath a capacity to di&s;tingui&s;h between good and evil; and is con&s;cious that he is bound to practice the one, and to avoid the other. "What is intended," &s;ays the pious Mr. Hallyburton, "may be reduced to the&s;e two a&s;&s;ertions, viz. That men are born with &s;uch faculties, which cannot, after they are capable of exerci&s;ing them, but admit the obligation and binding force of &s;ome, at lea&s;t, of the laws of nature, when they are fairly offered to their thoughts. And that man is &s;o &s;tated, that he cannot mi&s;s occa&s;ions of thinking of, or coming to the knowledge of tho&s;e laws of nature. The Gentiles, all of them, do
<PB N="xxvi" REF="012033_0024_0F897193B5D82A18">by nature tho&s;e things, that is, the material part of tho&s;e duties, which the law of nature enjoins; which &s;hews the work of the law, or &s;ome part of it, at lea&s;t, to be written in their hearts, &s;ince they do &s;ome things it enjoins: I do not think that this writing of the law imports innate ideas, or innate actual knowledge; neither the apo&s;tle's &s;cope nor words oblige us to this". nor doth it imply, that the will of God in it's full extent is immediately clear and evident to men.</P>
<P>ONE would imagine by the exalted terms in which &s;ome men &s;peak of the light of nature, that the whole &s;y&s;tem of moral truth aro&s;e &s;pon|taneou&s;ly in the mind of man, without any help at all; that he had need only to open his eyes, in order to have a right di&s;cernment of the perfections of God, and a compleat view of all the duty we owe him.</P>
<P>IT is doubtful, whether the original progenitors of the human race, however perfect in their kind they are repre&s;ented, had &s;uch an intire acquaint|ance with moral truth, as to need no in&s;truction from their Maker. It is hardly probable, that they had &s;uch exalted powers, and &s;uch a com|prehen&s;ive view of divine truth, as &s;ome have a&s;cribed to them. There is no accounting for their &s;o ea&s;y defection from their original &s;tate, if we &s;uppo&s;e this to be the ca&s;e. Perhaps we
<PB N="xxvii" REF="012033_0025_0F897194C1FD8580">&s;hall carry our thoughts of human nature, in it's fir&s;t con&s;titution, as high as the &s;cripture warrants; if we &s;uppo&s;e, that the under&s;tanding and other powers were adju&s;ted to the law, under which man was placed. He had the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions and appetites that men have now; but being free from all moral blemi&s;hes and defects, he was able to re&s;train and govern them, and to make them conducive to the enjoyment of greater good. His rea&s;on was &s;ufficient, with the helps he might ex|pect from his Creator, to direct his moral con|duct, and to rai&s;e him to that exalted happine&s;s, which his rank in the &s;cale of beings qualified him for. But he was to come to the perfection of his nature by degrees; and had he &s;tood the trial appointed by his Maker, he would have con&s;tant|ly improved, in the knowlege of God and of the divine law; and have made continual approaches to that glorious Being, who is the &s;tandard of perfection.</P>
<P>MAN is evidently at pre&s;ent in a &s;tate of degra|dation, we &s;ee only the ruins of an excellent and noble creature. If we had no help from revela|tion, it would be a rational deduction from the &s;tate in which we find our&s;elves, that human nature is not in all re&s;pects the &s;ame it once was; that mankind are in a fallen, as they certainly are in a weak and depraved &s;tate. Man is &s;till an intelli|gent
<PB N="xxviii" REF="012033_0026_0F89719655198510">creature, he is capable of thinking and re|flecting, of judging of truth and fal&s;hood, of di&s;tingui&s;hing between right and wrong; but the candle of the Lord gives but a dim and feeble light. Man, through inattention and corruption, or &s;ome other cau&s;e, if left to him&s;elf, would certainly attain to very little knowlege of God or his duty. Rea&s;on is blinded by a thou&s;and pa&s;&s;ions, and we often act in direct contradiction to it. Yea, &s;o great is the darkne&s;s which has over&s;pread the human mind, that we &s;ome|times "call evil good, and good evil".</P>
<P>THOSE men, who talk in &s;uch high &s;trains of the light of nature, and who affirm with &s;o much confidence, that all, "even the mo&s;t ignorant and illiterate of the human race, have naturally and nece&s;&s;arily a clear and intimate perception of the whole of religion and their duty", <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chri&s;tianity as old as the Creation.</NOTE> forget that they were once children, and by what gradual &s;teps they arrived to the degree of knowlege, to which they have attained, and of which they are &s;o rea|dy to boa&s;t. The mo&s;t acute Philo&s;opher at his fir&s;t entrance into life, had &s;carce any ideas or con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s at all. He who afterwards makes the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed figure among the great and wi&s;e men of the earth, is, when born, as much an infant in knowlege and under&s;tanding, as in
<PB N="xxix" REF="012033_0027_0F897196B4D42F68">&s;tature and in &s;peech. He knows not the u&s;e of the various parts of his body, is incapable of con|&s;idering the objects around him, or of providing for his own nece&s;&s;ities; much le&s;s is he capable of contemplating the works of God, of forming any conceptions of his Being and Perfections. Mo&s;t of the knowlege he gets is by the help of others, and from the tuition and in&s;truction he receives in &s;ociety. Many truths, which are com|municated by others, and which we &s;ee to be quite agreable to rea&s;on, we might never have thought of, if we had been left wholly to our &s;elves, and had received no a&s;&s;i&s;tance or in&s;truction from abroad. We nece&s;&s;arily a&s;&s;ent to mathematical truths, when we &s;ee them demon&s;trated; and yet we have not any innate knowledge of them, they do not ari&s;e &s;pontaneou&s;ly in our minds, and only a very few have any acquaintance at all with them.</P>
<P>THE great truths of Religion are founded in the rea&s;on and nature of things. Man hath na|tural powers capable of &s;eeing and approving the&s;e truths; by a diligent u&s;e and improvement of the&s;e powers, he may make great proficiency in knowlege, not only of the things of nature, but of the things of God and Religion. The powers of human nature have never been carried to their highe&s;t pitch: It is very po&s;&s;ible it may arrive to
<PB N="xxx" REF="012033_0028_0F8971977B2DAC68">higher degrees of perfection, than any meer man hath ever attained to. But whatever men's natural powers are, or whatever they are capable of attain|ing to, if they do not exerci&s;e the&s;e powers, and have no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from tho&s;e about them, their knowlege will be confined within a very narrow compa&s;s. We may be ignorant of &s;elf-evident truths, if we do not attend to them; much more may we be ignorant of the truths of Natural Re|ligion, if we do not exerci&s;e our minds about them. If we are of our &s;elves capable of di&s;co|vering the&s;e truths in their full extent, a point not &s;o clear as &s;ome think it, they mu&s;t be di&s;cover|ed, not by intuition, but by clo&s;e application and a cour&s;e of rea&s;oning. Men are bound, by dili|gent &s;tudy and enquiry, to endeavor to know what God requires of them, and to practice the whole of their duty. They ought al&s;o to improve all tho&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tances and helps which are afforded them. A neglect, which proceeds from voluntary ignorance, is as really a crime, as if we had known our Lord's will and did it not.</P>
<P>BUT whatever powers man is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, and how agreable &s;oever the truths of religion are to pure and unprejudiced rea&s;on, it is impo&s;&s;ible to determine, how much or how little acquaintance man would have had with moral truths, by his own natural light, without in&s;truction. Certainly
<PB N="xxxi" REF="012033_0029_0F89719843F8BD28">many of the heathen lo&s;t &s;ome which we e&s;teem among the fir&s;t principles of Religion. "They changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed bea&s;ts, and creeping things". <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Rom. 23.</NOTE></P>
<P>IT is by no means fair to conclude, that man would, by the meer &s;trength of rea&s;on, have in|ve&s;tigated all that we can now prove to be ratio|nal. Nor doth it follow, becau&s;e we are capable of finding out a truth, that therefore we &s;hould cer|tainly have found it out. The corruptions of the human heart often, where they have the a&s;cendant, make them indolent with re&s;pect to the improve|ment of their minds; at lea&s;t, they might have kept us from &s;earching out &s;uch truths as would be di&s;agreable and unplea&s;ant to us; or if we had, by the exerci&s;e of our rea&s;oning powers, di&s;|covered &s;omething of the nature of moral virtue, if we were brought to &s;ee the difference between right and wrong; it is likely they would have been meer &s;peculations. Rea&s;on alone could &s;carce have &s;et moral truths before us, in &s;o &s;trong and amiable a light, as to have captivated our &s;ouls with its charms, overcome our corruptions, and brought us to a univer&s;al conformity to the nature and will of God. Mere conjectural di&s;coveries, or &s;urmi&s;es built on &s;ubtle &s;peculations, are not
<PB N="xxxii" REF="012033_0030_0F897198F64BE700">firm enough to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch a per&s;ua&s;ion of truth as would influence the mind to univer&s;al and con|&s;tant holine&s;s, in oppo&s;ition to its own corrupti|ons, and the enticements and temptations of an evil world. It mu&s;t be a full &s;atisfying and abiding conviction of the truth, that hath &s;uch powerful effects; a conviction too clear to be produced by una&s;&s;i&s;ted rea&s;on however impro|ved.</P>
<P>BUT if we &s;uppo&s;e, that we might, by the ex|erci&s;e of rea&s;on, arrive at the cleare&s;t view of the moral beauty there is in right action, or the fit|ne&s;s there is in the practice of virtue, yet I much que&s;tion, whether according to the pre&s;ent con&s;ti|tution of our natures, any ab&s;tract ideas of the fitne&s;s or unfitne&s;s of things would produce a right moral conduct. A &s;en&s;e of moral beauty, or of the excellency of holine&s;s, is of great u&s;e to a good mind; but it never was de&s;igned to be our only principle of action, in this &s;tate of trial. I own our natures would be more excellent, if a love of goodne&s;s were alone a &s;ufficient incitement to do right; it is likely this is the ca&s;e with &s;ome of the creatures above us; and po&s;&s;ibly our na|tures may ri&s;e to this. We are capable now of di&s;cerning the intrin&s;ic fitne&s;s of things, and of being moved by it; this capacity may gradually increa&s;e, till it &s;wallow up all other motives. The more we &s;ee of God, and conver&s;e with him, the more we
<PB N="xxxiii" REF="012033_0031_0F897199B5804618">&s;hall become like Him in his holine&s;s and his happine&s;s. At pre&s;ent, our nature is very much con&s;tituted of appetites and pa&s;&s;ions, which move us to action. So it was at fir&s;t, "The woman &s;aw", &s;ays the &s;acred Hi&s;torian, &s;peaking of Eve, "that the tree was good for food, and that it was plea&s;ant to the eyes". The motives to obe|dience, which God &s;aw fit to propo&s;e to Adam, were addre&s;&s;ed to his hopes and fears. "In the day thou eate&s;t thereof, thou &s;halt &s;urely die". The threatning implied a promi&s;e, that if he did not eat, he &s;hould live&mdash;and certainly we do not need &s;uch arguments le&s;s in our pre&s;ent &s;tate, than man did in a &s;tate of innocence.</P>
<P>IF man was &s;o con&s;tituted in his primaeval &s;tate, as to be influenced by his hopes and fears, we are not to &s;uppo&s;e he will be governed by higher motives now; at lea&s;t not by higher mo|tives only. But if we take man without a parti|cular revelation from God, what is there to excite his hopes?&mdash;Let us allow, that by the &s;trength of his own powers, and without any communi|cations from above, he hath conceived ju&s;t no|tions of God and of his law; for if his notions are not ju&s;t, all inferences from them are but idle imaginations; but if his notions are ju&s;t, the lea&s;t reflection will convince him, that he hath in many in&s;tances tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the law of his na|ture,
<PB N="xxxiv" REF="012033_0032_0F89719A745771D0">which is the law of God; that he hath ex|po&s;ed him&s;elf to the ju&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure of a Being, who&s;e arm none can re&s;i&s;t. And what rea&s;on hath he to think God will pa&s;s by his offence and receive him into favor?</P>
<P>IF from the promi&s;cuous di&s;pen&s;ation of things in the pre&s;ent &s;tate, he infers that there will be a future &s;tate of retribution, wherein a difference will be made according to men's moral conduct, yet rea&s;on alone could not make it certain, that God would reward any obedience which man now yields; as he yields none, that is not mingled with a great deal of imperfection and &s;in. All are &s;inners, all may therefore expect to be treat|ed as &s;inners; they who have &s;inned more than others, may ju&s;tly expect greater puni&s;hment. But how any can upon the principles of rea&s;on be certain of a reward, becau&s;e they have not been &s;o bad as &s;ome others, I cannot &s;ee. The light of nature cannot a&s;&s;ure us, that God will forgive a &s;inner upon his repentance; of con&s;e|quence he hath no encouragement to repent; and if he hath no encouragement to repent, there is no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e he will repent. It is more likely, that, if he reflects on his &s;tate, he will &s;ink under a &s;en&s;e of his guilt, and an appre|hen&s;ion of puni&s;hment. Such would probably be the ca&s;e, if men had ju&s;t &s;entiments of God
<PB N="xxxv" REF="012033_0033_0F89719B36596808">and his law, without any intimation from Him, that He would pardon their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions and re|&s;tore them to favor.</P>
<P>You will &s;ay perhaps, that the Heathen have had &s;ome per&s;ua&s;ion of a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments; but I fear, if the light of na|ture will afford no better evidence of future re|wards than the Heathen have had, moral virtue or religion will receive but little a&s;&s;i&s;tance from it. Alas! what dark and confu&s;ed notions have they entertained! how gro&s;s and &s;en&s;ual their repre&s;entations of future happine&s;s! &s;uch as we evidently &s;ee to be unworthy of God, and no way calculated to convey re&s;t to the mind of man. Their good men after this life, remember their griefs, and are afflicted with the enmities they contracted here; their exerci&s;es and enjoyments are &s;uited to a bodily &s;tate, rather than to a &s;tate of pure &s;pirits.</P>
<P>If here and there an eminent Philo&s;opher had more rational conceptions of the&s;e things, yet no one acquainted with the hi&s;tory of the world, even of the politer nations, will pretend, that this was the ca&s;e with the body of the people. Even their wi&s;e&s;t Philo&s;ophers had rather a &s;u&s;pi|cion, than a full per&s;ua&s;ion of a future &s;tate; and "yet &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s &s;eems of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity in
<PB N="xxxvi" REF="012033_0034_0F89719BF6789868">this ca&s;e, &s;ince a re&s;pect to the recompence of the reward mu&s;t be always prevalent, in order to influence to a &s;teady pur&s;uit". Agreably you &s;eldom find their be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t men fetching any con&s;olation from the &s;tate of re&s;t which remaineth for good men; their exhortations to virtue are not enforced by this; if they believed the doc|trine of future rewards them&s;elves, yet they did not think it worth while to per&s;uade others into a belief of it. For want of this argument, how fri|gid and jejune are all their exhortations to virtue! Even the di&s;cour&s;es of a Seneca or a Cicero have not a tendency to warm our hearts, like the una|dorned addre&s;&s;es of a plain unlettered Chri&s;tian, who is acquainted with the &s;acred &s;criptures, and the powerful motives of the Go&s;pel. How much better notions of morality hath a common Chri&s;ti|an, who at all attends to the precepts of the Go&s;|pel, or even a modern Dei&s;t, who is acquainted with the Bible, than the wi&s;e&s;t &s;ages of antiqui|ty! How much clearer his views of a future &s;tate! The Go&s;pel makes that certain, which, without it, is but a dark conjecture.</P>
<P>BESIDES, the revelation with which God hath favored us, teaches how He can be ju&s;t and yet ju&s;tify the &s;inner; it opens the my&s;teries of redeem|ing love and grace; it contains the mo&s;t graci|ous declarations of God's readine&s;s to pardon the
<PB N="xxxvii" REF="012033_0035_0F89719D9404B5C8">penitent believer; it offers the mo&s;t gracious a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and promi&s;es the mo&s;t glorious rewards. By the help of this, we know many truths, which una&s;&s;i&s;ted rea&s;on never would have taught us; and we under&s;tand the truths of natural religion, much better than we could have under&s;tood them without this help. By means of revelation, we are capable of making a much better u&s;e of rea&s;on, than we could have made without it.</P>
<P>THERE is nothing in Chri&s;tianity that is contra|ry to rea&s;on. God never did, He never can, au|thorize a religion oppo&s;ite to it, becau&s;e this would be to contradict him&s;elf. The Go&s;pel is not de&s;igned to abrogate the Religion of Nature, it always &s;uppo&s;es an eternal rule of righteou&s;ne&s;s, from which man had deviated, and by which he was condemned. Man had rebelled again&s;t his Maker and Lord; had renounced his dependence on God, and &s;et him&s;elf up in oppo&s;ition to Him; in all which he acted contrary to the Religion of Nature. The de&s;ign of the Go&s;pel was to re|duce him to a right &s;tate, to bring him to live on God, to &s;ubmit to his authority, to re&s;ign to his will, and to rely upon him for every good thing.</P>
<P>UNDER this di&s;pen&s;ation God appears in a new character, in a new relation, as the God and Fa|ther
<PB N="xxxviii" REF="012033_0036_0F89719E94A22290">of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as a God pardoning iniquity tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and &s;in. This was a cha|racter in which the Deity could not appear, till man had &s;inned, it was a di&s;covery of &s;omething in his nature, which neither Men nor Angels had before any conception of. From this new cha|racter, or new relation, ari&s;e new obligations, and new duties; duties which there could be no place for, while man was in a &s;tate of innocence, but which are perfectly adapted to his &s;tate as a &s;inner. This is by no means contrary to the Reli|gion of Nature. It is perfectly agreable to it, that we &s;hould conform to every new di&s;covery which God makes of him&s;elf, and attend to every new intimation of his will.</P>
<P>To give credit to a divine te&s;timony; to &s;ub|mit to a me&s;&s;enger &s;ent by God; to accept of pardon in his way, which is mo&s;t wi&s;e and good, and approves it&s;elf to the rea&s;on of man, all this is perfectly agreable to every principle of Natural Religion. Nothing is more contrary to truth, than to repre&s;ent faith and repentance as po&s;itive duties, they are founded in rea&s;on, they are the re&s;ult of that relation in which we &s;tand to God and Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and are exactly &s;uited to our pre|&s;ent apo&s;tate &s;tate.</P>
<P>THE Religion of Nature then, is the &s;ame it
<PB N="xxxix" REF="012033_0037_0F89719EF567D060">ever was, and "Chri&s;tianity is this very Religion, with &s;ome wi&s;e and merciful additions, accommo|dated to the &s;tate of mankind as &s;inners". The Go&s;pel adopts the whole law of nature, it ex|plains it, enjoins conformity to it, adds new obli|gations to obedience; and at the &s;ame time pro|vides and offers the kinde&s;t helps, to the perfor|mance of what it requires.</P>
<P>SOME may po&s;&s;ibly object, that I am di&s;cour&s;|ing of Revealed Religion, when my bu&s;ine&s;s was to treat of that which is Natural. But how is it po&s;&s;ible to give you any tolerable view of Natural Religion, without recurring to Revelation? "Who is there, &s;ays Mr. Locke, that ever did or un|dertook to give the law of nature to us all in|tire, as a law, no more, nor no le&s;s, than what is contained in, and had the obligation of, that law? who ever made out all the parts of it, put them together, and &s;hewed the world their obli|gations? where was there any &s;uch Code, that mankind might have recour&s;e to, as their unerring rule, before our Savior's time". <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Locke's rea&s;onablene&s;s of the Chri&s;tian Religion.</NOTE></P>
<P>BESIDES, what is "the proper u&s;e and im|provement of Natural Religion", the &s;ubject ex|pre&s;sly appointed for this Lecture by the pious Founder, but to lead you to that which is Reveal|ed?
<PB N="xl" REF="012033_0038_0F89719FB5A9DAA0">To what purpo&s;e &s;hould we di&s;cour&s;e of the obligations of Natural Law, if we could not lead you to the merciful di&s;coveries of the Go&s;pel? this would be to throw di&s;couragements in your way. He that rea&s;ons ju&s;tly upon the principles of Natural Religion, and goes no further, I will not &s;ay, mu&s;t de&s;pair, but mu&s;t have many doubts and &s;u&s;picions of ever obtaining the divine favor. In this re&s;pect "the law is our &s;chool-ma&s;ter to bring us to Chri&s;t". The doctrine of the atonement and of ju&s;tification by the merits and righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, not only &s;ees the divine character in the cleare&s;t light; but gives the great|e&s;t encouragement to repentance and obedience. "If thou, Lord, &s;houlde&s;t mark iniquity, O Lord, who &s;hall &s;tand? but there is forgivene&s;s with thee, that thou maye&s;t be feared." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">130 P&s;al. 3, 4.</NOTE></P>
<P>FURTHER, If Natural Religion is no more than has been found out by the natural powers of man, if we are not to include any thing that hath come to us by revelation, who is able to draw the line, and to &s;hew exactly which truths have been di&s;covered by rea&s;on, or the mere light of nature, and which have come to us by revelation? It is probable at lea&s;t, that God fir&s;t in&s;tructed men in the principles of religion, or taught them the law by which they were to be governed;
<PB N="xli" REF="012033_0039_0F8971A079889B70">and that their de&s;cendants, in all parts of the world, have received by tradition and education, &s;ome degree of that light and knowlege, which was communicated to their progenitors from the Deity him&s;elf. And if this was the ca&s;e, and no one can determine it was not, then we mu&s;t &s;ay, that there is no natural religion at all, or that its be|ing revealed doth not make it cea&s;e to be natural. If a law is founded in nature; and God, in&s;tead of leaving us to find it out by &s;tudy and applica|tion, is plea&s;ed kindly to make it known to us by revelation, will that make it cea&s;e to be a law of nature? if we may call that natural religion, which we receive by in&s;truction from our parents and others; why may we not call that natural reli|gion, which we are taught by our Heavenly Fa|ther? <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Nature is nothing but the &s;ettled Divine con&s;titution, fixing the way in, and the means by which He conveys his grace, or which is the &s;ame thing in which He exerts his creating and &s;upporting power, and whatever order He &s;ees fit to e&s;tabli&s;h for this purpo&s;e is nature, and that con|&s;titution is the Law of Nature".
<P>A view of the Law of Nature, written, it is &s;aid, by Dr. Ricaltoun.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>HOWEVER Chri&s;tianity comes to us; or how|ever &s;upernatural the way in which it was origi|nally communicated; it &s;o far coincides with the Religion of Nature, that it is founded in the per|fections of God, and is perfectly con&s;onant to the rea&s;on of man.</P>
<P><PB N="xlii" REF="012033_0040_0F8971A135AF6C68">
I KNOW it is &s;aid, that "were we not capable of di&s;tingui&s;hing good from evil, or knowing from the con&s;ideration of the invariable perfecti|ons of God, what the divine goodne&s;s could command or forbid his creatures, antecedently to any external revelation, we could not di&s;tingui&s;h the true in&s;tituted religion from the many fal&s;e ones". <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chri&s;tianity as old as the Creation.</NOTE> But this rea&s;oning is founded upon a mi&s;take, it &s;uppo&s;es that when men have once corrupted religion, they are left intirely without remedy. The capacity of thinking and rea&s;oning, with which God hath di&s;tingui&s;hed man, how|ever it hath been neglected or perverted, will, whenever he is led to make a proper u&s;e of it, enable him to di&s;tingui&s;h between true and fal&s;e religion. There is no nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a previous comprehen&s;ive knowlege of God, or of good and evil. It is not of &s;o great importance, whether men have antecedently rea&s;oned ju&s;tly or not, or indeed whether they have rea&s;oned at all. If they are awakened to attend to a religion propo&s;ed to them, and to examine it with impartiality and care, they are capable of di&s;tingui&s;hing between right and wrong, and of perceiving whether this religi|on is worthy of God. A revelation from God may &s;et many truths and duties before them, which
<PB N="xliii" REF="012033_0041_0F8971A1F5F9FA58">were before unknown, and yet when pre&s;ented to their minds, may appear perfectly agreable to their rea&s;on and under&s;tanding; otherwi&s;e when men have once formed wrong notions of religion, it is impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould correct their errors, and rea&s;on becomes for ever unprofitable.</P>
<P>BUT what &s;hall we &s;ay of the Heathen, who have no written revelation? By what rule will they be judged? and what will be their &s;tate after this life? &s;uch inquiries are too bold and pre&s;umptuous, "&s;ecret things belong unto the Lord our God, but tho&s;e things which are re|vealed belong unto us and to our children". It is certain the mo&s;t ignorant have &s;ome rule, however they came by it, and they will be judged by the rule which they have, and not by that which they have not. It is evident that the Hea|then have &s;ome notion of expiation and forgive|ne&s;s, as well as &s;ome knowlege of God, and of the di&s;tinction between virtue and vice; both are imperfect, and it may be &s;aid of them, that "they hold the truth in unrighteou&s;ne&s;s", and with &s;uch a mixture of ignorance and uncertainty, as that it can afford but little re&s;t to their minds. But we may a&s;&s;ure our&s;elves that the Judge of all the earth will do right; and that He will &s;o order things, that none of mankind will have any rea|&s;on
<PB N="xliv" REF="012033_0042_0F8971A2B5A8B1C0">to complain. If the Heathen have no hope of the &s;alvation, which the Go&s;pel promi&s;es; nei|ther are they expo&s;ed to that damnation, which it threatens to tho&s;e who de&s;pi&s;e and reject it. In|&s;tead of puzzling our &s;elves with &s;uch curious inquiries, let us fear le&s;t this &s;hould be our "con|demnation, that light is come into the world, but we have loved darkne&s;s rather than light, becau&s;e our deeds have been evil".</P>
<P>WE, in this favored land, are lift up to Heaven, with re&s;pect to our &s;piritual privileges; we have many and great advantages to know our Ma&s;ter's will; we have the &s;criptures which are able to make us wi&s;e unto &s;alvation; we have &s;ingular helps to under&s;tand them; we have line upon line, and precept upon precept. As to means nothing is wanting. We ought often to think of that mo&s;t equitable rule, by which our Savior a&s;&s;ures us the Great God will conduct him&s;elf. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">12 Luke 48.</NOTE> "Unto whom&s;oever much is given, of him &s;hall be much required".</P>
<P>You, my Young Friends, who are &s;o happy, as to have your education in this Seat of Learning, have a mo&s;t valuable price put into your hands, an op|portunity
<PB N="xlv" REF="012033_0043_0F8971A376CFD088">not only to furni&s;h your minds with human literature, but to acquire &s;piritual and divine knowlege&mdash;All will be in&s;ufficient, unle&s;s "God, who cau&s;ed the light to &s;hine out of darkne&s;s, &s;hine in your hearts to give the light of the glory of God in the face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t". We take plea&s;ure in your literary accompli&s;h|ment, the&s;e things are well worthy your atten|tion and diligent application. But while you a&s;|pire after an acquaintance with the various bran|ches of learning, we &s;hew unto you a more ex|cellent way. "This is life eternal, that ye know God and Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom he hath &s;ent". "Wi&s;|dom is the principal thing, therefore get wi&s;dom, and with all thy getting, get under&s;tanding. Ex|alt her and &s;he &s;hall promote thee; &s;he &s;hall bring thee to honor, when thou do&s;t embrace her".</P>
