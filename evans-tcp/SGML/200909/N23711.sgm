<DIV3 TYPE="deposition">
<P>William Smith, one of the repre&s;entatives of the &s;tate of South-Carolina, in the Congre&s;s of the United States, declares&mdash;</P>
<P>That on Tue&s;day la&s;t, the twenty-&s;econd in&s;tant, a per|&s;on who called him&s;elf Randall, and who is &s;aid to be from the &s;tate of Maryland, applied to him at his lodgings, in the city of Philadelphia, and reque&s;ted a private and confidential conver&s;ation of an hour, which the informant agreed to; and at the time appointed, which was the &s;ame evening, the &s;aid Randall being alone with the informant, communicated to him a pro|po&s;al for procuring from the legi&s;lature of the United States, a grant of about eighteen or twenty millions of acres, in the north we&s;tern territory, between lakes Mi|chigan, Huron and Erie. That the &s;aid Randall ob&s;erv|ed, that the grant he propo&s;ed, would be of great &s;ervice to the United States, from the per&s;ons who would be in|tere&s;ted
<PB N="12" REF="031364_0011_0FEC44011C29EE30">
therein, (to wit; certain Canada merchants, at or near Detroit, who&s;e names he did not mention) having great influence over the Indians, who were not pacified by the late treaty concluded with general Wayne; and that the &s;aid per&s;ons would extingui&s;h the Indian claims, at their own expen&s;e; and after &s;etting forth the &s;aving of expen&s;e, by the ce&s;&s;ation of the Indian war, and other rea&s;ons to induce a belief that the propo&s;ed grant would be of public utility, he proceeded to inform the informant, that the intention was to divide the land into about forty &s;hares, twenty-four of which would be allowed to, or di&s;tributed among &s;uch per&s;ons (mean|ing, as this informant under&s;tood him, from the whole purport of his conver&s;ation, members of Congre&s;s) as would favor the mea&s;ure: that of the&s;e twenty-four &s;hares, he had the management or di&s;tribution of twelve, for the &s;outhern part, (meaning, as the informant un|der&s;tood, the &s;outhern members of Congre&s;s) and ano|ther per&s;on, who&s;e name he did not mention, had the di&s;po&s;ition of the other twelve, for the ea&s;tern part, (&s;till, as the informant under&s;tood, and believes, meaning as afore&s;aid.) That he, the &s;aid Randall, propo&s;ed &s;ubdi|viding the &s;aid &s;hares into &s;o many portions, as to have a &s;ufficiency to obtain a majority (meaning, as the in|formant under&s;tood him, a majority of Congre&s;s) and that gentlemen, after the &s;e&s;&s;ion was over, or when they returned to private life, might then have &s;uch parts of &s;hares, as the &s;aid twenty-four &s;hares would be re|&s;erved for &s;uch of them as would favor the bu&s;ine&s;s, on the &s;ame terms as the original a&s;&s;ociators. That the view of him, the &s;aid Randall, and of tho&s;e concerned with him, was to pre&s;ent a memorial, on the following Mon|day, to Congre&s;s, to obtain the &s;aid grant for a &s;mall price, mentioning half a million of dollars; and that he &s;uppo&s;ed the land was worth more than two &s;hillings an acre. On taking leave, he pre&s;&s;ed the informant for an early and deci&s;ive an&s;wer to the foregoing propo|&s;als; to which the informant replied, that he would not wi&s;h to &s;ee him again before Friday morning, and
<PB N="13" REF="031364_0012_0FEC4390DE9DB520">

<P>Mr. Murray declares, that on Wedne&s;day la&s;t, the twenty-third in&s;tant, Mr. Smith, member of Congre&s;s, of South-Carolina, informed him, that a man of the name of Randall, of Maryland, had the evening before attempted to bribe him in we&s;tern lands, on condition of his &s;upporting an application, which Randall told him he &s;hould &s;oon make to Congre&s;s; the object of which application was, a grant from Congre&s;s, of from eighteen to twenty millions of acres of land, between Erie, Hu|ron and Michigan. That Mr. Smith was extremely &s;o|licitous, that &s;ome other gentleman &s;hould immediately be informed of the infamous propo&s;al, and that he &s;aid he would mention it to Mr. Henry, of the Senate, and advi&s;e with him, upon proper mea&s;ures for the detecting
<PB N="14" REF="031364_0013_0FEC44059478EFB0">
of the full extent of the &s;cheme, and cru&s;hing it.&mdash;That he had no opportunity of talking to Mr. Henry, on that day; but early on the morning of the twenty-fourth in|&s;tant, communicated the intelligence to Mr. Henry, who recommended, that Mr. Smith &s;hould immediately in|form the Pre&s;ident: That on the &s;aid day, Mr. Randall of Maryland, was introduced to him, the informant, and reque&s;ted a confidential interview, at his, the in|formant's lodgings, which the informant readily pro|mi&s;ed him, to be at five, for the purpo&s;e of developing his &s;cheme. That Randall came at or near five, that day la&s;t named, to wit; on Thur&s;day, and communi|cated to Mr. Henry and him&s;elf, in general terms, the outline of a plan, by which he, Randall and his Cana|da friends, would extingui&s;h the Indian title to all the lands between lakes Erie, Huron and Michigan, as mark|ed on a map which Randall then &s;hewed, containing from eighteen to twenty millions of acres. That he, the informant, then a&s;ked Randall into his apartment, where they were alone. That Randall expatiated at fir&s;t upon the public utility of his &s;cheme, which was, that Congre&s;s &s;hould grant to him, and his company, all the land afore|&s;aid mentioned, for five hundred thou&s;and, or at mo&s;t, one million of dollars; and that he would undertake, in four months, that the harmony of the Indians &s;hould be &s;ecured to the union; or if Congre&s;s thought proper, that the Indian tribes, now on &s;aid land, &s;hould be removed to the Briti&s;h &s;ide, or down lake Michigan, re&s;erving to &s;ome aged chiefs, a few miles &s;quare; that his com|pany and him&s;elf had determined to divide the lands afore&s;aid, into forty (or forty-one) &s;hares. That of the&s;e &s;hares, twenty-four were to be re&s;erved for the di&s;|po&s;al of him&s;elf and his partner, now in town, for &s;uch members of Congre&s;s as a&s;&s;i&s;ted them, by their abilities and votes, in obtaining the grant afore&s;aid.&mdash;That of the&s;e twenty-four &s;hares, his partner had twelve un|der his management, for the ea&s;tern members of Con|gre&s;s, and that he, Randall, had the other twelve &s;hares under his management, for the &s;outhern members of

Congre&s;s. That the&s;e &s;hares were to be &s;o divided as to accompli&s;h the object by &s;ecuring a majority of Congre&s;s.

<P>William B. Giles, a member of the Hou&s;e of Repre|&s;entatives, in the Congre&s;s of the United States, de|clares&mdash;</P>
<P>That in the evening of Thur&s;day, the &s;eventeenth of December, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and ninety-five, as well as this informant recollects, a per&s;on called upon this informant, at his lodgings, under the name of Robert Randall, with an introductory note from Mr. Gabriel
<PB N="16" REF="031364_0015_0FEC440CC4B8E878">
Chri&s;tie, in the u&s;ual form, dated the fifteenth of the &s;ame month.</P>
<P>That the &s;aid Robert Randall informed this informant, that he had &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s of importance to communicate to this informant, which would probably come before Congre&s;s: That it re&s;pected the fur trade, at pre&s;ent car|ried on by the Briti&s;h traders with the Indians, through the lakes. He ob&s;erved, that it would be important to change the cour&s;e of that trade into &s;ome channel through the United States.&mdash;That he believed he could put Congre&s;s upon &s;ome plan of effecting that object.&mdash;That the plan was of a &s;ecret nature.&mdash;That he was not then prepared to di&s;clo&s;e it, and reque&s;ted a private interview with this informant, for that purpo&s;e, at &s;ome other time. Upon which reque&s;t, this informant appointed the next Satur|day, at twelve o'clock, (being the nineteenth of Decem|ber) to receive the communication.</P>
<P>That about the time appointed, the &s;aid Robert Ran|dall called on this informant, and after &s;ome general con|ver&s;ation, informed this informant, that an a&s;&s;ociation had been formed by him&s;elf and others, with &s;ome of the mo&s;t influential traders at Detroit, for the purpo&s;e of purcha|&s;ing all the lands contained in the penin&s;ula formed by the lakes Erie, Huron and Michigan, and the waters connect|ing tho&s;e lakes, amounting in the whole to twenty or thir|ty millions of acres, if the con&s;ent of Congre&s;s could be obtained for the extingui&s;hment of the Indian claims thereto. The &s;aid Randall then produced a map of the penin&s;ula and lakes.</P>
<P>That this tract of country was to be divided into &s;hares, and that a number of &s;hares was to be left unappropriated, until the nece&s;&s;ary law of Congre&s;s &s;hould pa&s;s, authoriz|ing the extingui&s;hment of the Indian claims; and might then be filled up by tho&s;e who might think proper to con|cur in the plan, and &s;hould give their aid for procuring the pa&s;&s;age of &s;uch law. Upon this intimation, this in|formant ob&s;erved, that he hoped the &s;aid Randall did not intend to addre&s;s the information of the unappropriated &s;hares, particularly to this informant.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="031364_0016_0FEC44E1665C5FA0">
To which the &s;aid Randall replied, that he did not: That he only meant it as general information; but he could &s;ee no impropriety in the members of Congre&s;s be|ing concerned in the &s;cheme, if the public good was to be promoted by it; and that thirty or forty members were already engaged in its &s;upport; or words to that effect.</P>
<P>After &s;ome further conver&s;ation of a general nature, re&s;pecting the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the fur trade; the value of the lands contained in the penin&s;ula; and the probable effect of the late treaty upon that trade and country, the &s;aid Randall enquired of this informant "whether he deemed his plan advi&s;able, and whether it would meet with the &s;upport of this informant, in Congre&s;s." To which this informant replied, that if the &s;aid Randall &s;hould bring his propo&s;als before Congre&s;s, this infor|mant would give them the con&s;ideration which his duty required, and &s;hould give &s;uch vote as he deemed right; or words to the &s;ame effect. Very &s;hortly after this ob&s;ervation, Mr. Edward Living&s;ton, a member of Con|gre&s;s from New-York, entered the room, and the &s;aid Randall left it, without further ob&s;ervation, as well as this informant recollects. This informant immediately communicated the contents of this conver&s;ation to Mr. Living&s;ton, and declared that he con&s;idered the proffer of the unappropriated &s;hares to the members of Con|gre&s;s, a direct attempt at corruption.</P>
<P>This informant, on the &s;ame day, communicated the &s;ub&s;tance of the conver&s;ation to the Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives of the United States, to Me&s;&s;rs. Blount and Macon of North-Carolina, and to Me&s;&s;rs. Madi&s;on and Venable of Virginia. It was deemed ad|vi&s;able by all the&s;e gentlemen, as well as by this infor|mant, to permit the plan to be brought before Congre&s;s in the u&s;ual way, by memorial, and to cau&s;e a detection, by means of a committee, to whom the &s;aid memorial &s;hould be referred: and in the mean time, if the &s;aid Randall &s;hould again call on this informant, he &s;hould proceed to make further di&s;covery of the real &s;tate and nature of the tran&s;action.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="031364_0017_0FEC44E32DEEE940">
That on the next day, the &s;aid Randall did again call on this informant, and informed him, that he, the &s;aid Randall, then propo&s;ed to di&s;clo&s;e his plan more particularly; and after &s;ome general remarks upon the public utility, as well as individual benefit of the plan, he &s;aid that it was in &s;ub&s;tance as follows:</P>
<P>The tract of country before de&s;cribed, was to be divided into forty-one &s;hares; five of which were to be re&s;erved to the Indian traders at Detroit; the other thirty-&s;ix were to be divided into two departments; eighteen to the ea&s;tern, and eighteen to the &s;outhern department. That &s;ix, out of the eighteen &s;hares, were to be re&s;erved to his ea&s;tern partner and a&s;&s;ociates, and &s;ix, out of the remaining eighteen, to him&s;elf and his a&s;&s;ociates. That the remaining twenty-four &s;hares were to be left unappropriated, for the u&s;e of &s;uch members of Congre&s;s as &s;hould &s;upport the mea&s;ure. That the names of tho&s;e members were not to be made known until after the law for the extingui&s;hment of the Indian claims had pa&s;&s;ed: and then reque&s;ted this informant to prepare &s;ome writing which would compel the o&s;ten|&s;ible per&s;ons to &s;urrender the unappropriated &s;hares to the real &s;upporters of the mea&s;ure, after it &s;hould be effected. That one million of dollars were &s;poken of, as the price for the lands; but that he deemed that &s;um by far too much; and as Congre&s;s would have to fix the price, they might make the terms &s;uch as to en|&s;ure con&s;iderable emoluments to the purcha&s;ers. That a majority of the Senate had con&s;ented to give the plan their &s;upport, and within three of a majority of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives. After much further conver|&s;ation on the &s;ubject, which this informant thinks unne|ce&s;&s;ary to particularize, the &s;aid Randall promi&s;ed to wait again on this informant, at his lodgings, on Tue&s;day evening, at &s;even o'clock, and introduce to this infor|mant, his ea&s;tern a&s;&s;ociate.</P>
<P>The &s;aid Randall did not call at the appointed hour, and this informant did not &s;ee him again until Friday, the twenty-fifth of December, when the &s;aid Randall
<PB N="19" REF="031364_0018_0FEC44E5B241D070">
again called on this informant, and after making an apology, for not calling at the appointed hour of the preceding Tue&s;day, informed him at the door of his apartment, that his memorial to Congre&s;s would be ready to be pre&s;ented on the next Monday; but as &s;everal gentlemen were in this informant's room, at that time, the &s;aid Randall did not enter, and no further conver&s;ation was then had: &s;ince which time this in|formant has not &s;een the &s;aid Randall, until he was brought to the bar of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, in cu&s;tody.</P>
<P>This informant further &s;aith, that he communicated the &s;ub&s;tance of every material conver&s;ation with the &s;aid Randall, to the Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Repre|&s;entatives, and to the &s;everal gentlemen before men|tioned.</P>

<P>I, Daniel Buck, inform and &s;ay, that about ten days previous to my &s;etting out on my journey to Congre&s;s (which was on the thirtieth day of November la&s;t,) a &s;tranger, whom I now know to be Charles Whitney, in cu&s;tody of the Serjeant-at-arms, called at my office in Norwich, in the &s;tate of Vermont, introduced him|&s;elf by the name of Whitney, and informed me, that he had &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s of importance which he wi&s;hed to conver&s;e with me upon. I a&s;ked if he wi&s;hed to be in private, he &s;ignified that he did, upon which my clerk withdrew; and the &s;aid Whitney proceeded to in|form me that the bu&s;ine&s;s of which he wi&s;hed to con|ver&s;e, was of great importance to the public, as well as to the individuals immediately concerned.&mdash;That it would come before Congre&s;s, but was &s;o circum&s;tanced as to render it nece&s;&s;ary to make a previous &s;tatement to &s;ome of the members, that they might be able to ex|plain to others; and the whole thereby be better prepa|red to judge upon the bu&s;ine&s;s: he declared he wi&s;hed for nothing improper, and that he did not want that I
<PB N="20" REF="031364_0019_0FEC44E765927820">
&s;hould favor the plan, unle&s;s I &s;aw it to be con&s;i&s;tent; for he &s;aid he wanted nothing but what was perfectly ju&s;t and honorable, and was confident that if the mat|ter could be under&s;tood, it would appear to be of great public utility: he then &s;tated, that he and his a&s;&s;ocia|tes had di&s;covered a large and immen&s;ely valuable tract of land, between, or contiguous to, lakes Erie, Huron and Michigan, (if I mi&s;take not the names) which he &s;aid might be purcha&s;ed of the Indians, at a low rate: That this purcha&s;e would conciliate the affections, and &s;ecure the friend&s;hip of the ho&s;tile tribes.&mdash;That he, the &s;aid Whitney, together with Ebenezer Allen, doctor Randall, and a number of Canadian merchants at De|troit, had formed an a&s;&s;ociation for the purpo&s;e of extingui&s;hing the Indian title, and petitioning Con|gre&s;s for the pre-emption right to tho&s;e lands; that if they &s;ucceeded, it was their intention immediately to make &s;ettlement on them.&mdash;That tho&s;e merchants had &s;uch influence with, and controul over the Indians, that there would be no difficulty with them; and that &s;uch a &s;ettlement would be a barrier again&s;t the &s;avages, and effectually &s;ecure peace to the United States.&mdash;That tho&s;e merchants were then employed in the bu&s;ine&s;s, among the Indians; and that his partner, doctor Ran|dall and his other a&s;&s;ociates, had &s;uch connections, that there was a fair pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s.&mdash;That it was not their intention, however, to engro&s;s all this property to them&s;elves; but that it was to be divided into a num|ber of &s;hares, and that he and the &s;aid Randall had the di&s;po&s;al of them.&mdash;That he, the &s;aid Whitney, was then directly from Philadelphia, and that it was agreed that Randall &s;hould di&s;po&s;e of a part among&s;t his friends, and the influential characters in the &s;outhern &s;tates; that he, the &s;aid Whitney, was to di&s;tribute the other part among&s;t his the &s;aid Whitney's friends, and the influ|ential characters in the ea&s;tern and northern &s;tates.&mdash;That they had already got a number engaged, but that the &s;ub&s;cription was not full, and that I might become an adventurer, if I wi&s;hed for it; and as he conceived
<PB N="21" REF="031364_0020_0FEC44EA7A97C180">
that I could make my&s;elf acquainted with the facts, they, the &s;aid a&s;&s;ociates, would be able &s;o clearly to demon|&s;trate the public utility of the mea&s;ure, that there could be no impropriety in my being concerned in the bu&s;ine&s;s, as I &s;hould thereby only connect my private intere&s;t with the public good; and while I was advancing the greate&s;t intere&s;t of my country, might put two or three thou&s;and dollars in my own pocket. Upon my &s;ug|ge&s;ting that, by a late treaty, a peace was already con|cluded with the Indians: and that this was a bu&s;ine&s;s that might involve in it an important national que&s;tion, as, by the treaty, the right of purcha&s;ing lands of the Indians, was re&s;erved to the United States, the &s;aid Whitney replied and &s;aid, that the Indians were greatly di&s;&s;atisfied with the treaty, and would not keep it; and that another war would be the certain con&s;equence, un|le&s;s other mea&s;ures were adopted. He then renewed the prote&s;tations of the purity of his intentions, and &s;aid, that he conceived that they (meaning him&s;elf and a&s;&s;ociates, as I under&s;tood him) &s;hould &s;o clearly evince the utility of the plan, as that there could be no doubt of its pro|priety in the mind of any well-wi&s;her to his country; and &s;aid, that he thought it would be hard to &s;uppo&s;e that members of Congre&s;s were, in con&s;equence of their appointment, to be deprived of tho&s;e advantages to ac|quire property which might be taken by others. The &s;aid Whitney &s;hewed me a plan of the country, and the articles of agreement between the a&s;&s;ociates, which appear to be the &s;ame as have been read in Congre&s;s: he al&s;o &s;aid much upon the magnitude of the object, in re&s;pect to the &s;ub&s;cribers and partners: and though I cannot now repeat his expre&s;&s;ions, yet I can truly a&s;&s;ert, that I then clearly under&s;tood him, that if I would &s;ub&s;cribe as a partner, my name might be kept &s;ecret, and after the grant was obtained, if I cho&s;e to relinqui&s;h my &s;hare in the lands, I might receive money in lieu of it; though no &s;pecified &s;um was mentioned, other than has already been &s;tated; and the conver&s;ation finally broke off upon my declaring that I would make no engagement in the

bu&s;ine&s;s, until I was better informed as to the merits of the que&s;tion.</P>

<P>The declaration of Gabriel Chri&s;tie is, that &s;ome time in the month of October or November la&s;t, this informant was in Philadelphia, when he &s;aw Robert Randall, who had, as he informed this informant, ju&s;t returned from Canada, where he had been di&s;appointed in the bu&s;ine&s;s he went to that country on; but he, Randall, informed this informant, that on his way home, he had called at Detroit, where he had &s;pent &s;ome time; and had, he believed, entered into an a&s;&s;o|ciation, to which, if he got the con&s;ent of the govern|ment of the United States, would be of con&s;iderable advantage to him, and tho&s;e who cho&s;e to a&s;&s;ociate with him; and informed this informant, that he might be concerned with him, provided he liked the &s;pecula|tion:
<PB N="24" REF="031364_0023_0FEC45000D7F0C30">
he then informed this informant, that he had a&s;&s;ociated with a number of influential per&s;ons at De|troit, for the purpo&s;e of obtaining the pre-emption right to a large tract of country within the territory of the United States, and produced to this informant, the original a&s;&s;ociation. After this informant had heard all that Randall had to communicate to him, this in|formant told Randall, that he con&s;idered his &s;cheme as a wild goo&s;e one; and that this informant would not have any concern in it. Randall then reque&s;ted this informant, to give him his opinion in what manner he, Randall, ought to proceed: this informant told him, that the mo&s;t proper per&s;on to apply to, was Mr. Ran|dolph, the late &s;ecretary of &s;tate; and if he, Randall, thought proper, this informant would inform Mr. Ran|dolph of it, and get his advice, which Randall agreed to: this informant then went to Mr. Randolph, and gave him all the information that the informant had received from Randall. After con&s;idering the bu&s;ine&s;s &s;ome time, Mr. Randolph advi&s;ed, that an application &s;hould be made to the Pre&s;ident of the United States; which advice, the informant gave to Randall, who &s;eemed, at that time, fully &s;atisfied with the propo&s;al, and reque&s;ted the informant to introduce him to the Pre&s;ident, for that purpo&s;e; but as this informant was going out of town in a day or two, he told Randall, that he would introduce him to the Pre&s;ident, on his return to Congre&s;s. When the informant came to Philadelphia, in December, he found Randall in the city; and after a&s;king Randall, what he had done in his bu&s;ine&s;s, and whether he &s;till meant to apply to the Pre&s;ident, Randall then informed the informant, that his friend and a&s;&s;ociate, Mr. Whitney, had arrived in Philadelphia, and that upon con&s;ulting with him, they came to a determination not to apply to the Pre|&s;ident, as he heretofore had agreed, but had determin|ed to pre&s;ent a memorial to the legi&s;lature, for a grant of the &s;aid land. This informant told Randall, that he di&s;approved of this mode, and a&s;ked Randall who
<PB N="25" REF="031364_0024_0FEC4501E4FC5688">
had advi&s;ed him to it. Randall then informed the in|formant, that this &s;aid Mr. Whitney had informed him, that he had con&s;ulted with a number of the ea&s;tern members of Congre&s;s, and in particular, with Mr. Sedg|wick, who had advi&s;ed this mode of proceeding. Ran|dall al&s;o informed this informant, that Mr. Sedgwick had agreed to draw up, and pre&s;ent his memorial. This informant then informed Randall, that by this mode of proceeding, he had put it out of this inform|ant's power to be concerned with him, if he thought ever &s;o well of it. Randall a&s;ked the informant the rea&s;on; the informant an&s;wered, that it would be im|proper in any member of Congre&s;s, to be concerned in any thing that he was to vote on. This informant was not able to impre&s;s Randall with the propriety of his remark. The informant never under&s;tood, that Mr. Sedgwick was, in any manner, concerned with Randall, or his a&s;&s;ociates; but that he, Mr. Sedgwick, thought the thing a public benefit, and would &s;upport it. That Randall never informed this informant, that any of the members of Congre&s;s were concerned, but that a majority of them thought favourably of the plan, and would &s;upport it. In all the conver&s;ation the in|formant had with Randall, this informant told him, that he could not expect this informant's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as the informant would never agree to &s;ell any of the lands of the United States, for le&s;s than a dollar per acre. Randall then informed the informant, before a witne&s;s, that it was &s;trange, that the informant was the only per&s;on in Congre&s;s, that he had applied to, but what &s;eemed to think favorably of his plan; the informant told Randall, that his opinion was fixed, and &s;till advi&s;ed his application to the Pre&s;ident, which Randall declined.</P>

<P>The informant, Theodore Sedgwick, a member of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives of the United States, declares, that &s;ome time before he left the place of his re&s;idence in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, one I&s;rael Jones, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> of Adams, in that &s;tate, waited on him and introduced to him, a man whom he now knows by the name of Charles Whitney, of the &s;tate of Vermont. That Mr. Jones is a man of re&s;pectable character, a magi&s;trate, a member of the &s;tate legi&s;lature, (as the informant believes) and a tru&s;tee of the corporation of Williams college. That Mr. Jones informed the informant, that he, with others, had in contemplation an application to Congre&s;s, for a grant of a tract of country lying be|tween the lakes Huron, Michigan and Erie.&mdash;Con&s;i|derations of a public nature having been &s;tated and enlarged upon, the opinion of the informant was re|que&s;ted, relative to the propriety and &s;ucce&s;s of the propo&s;ed application. He an&s;wered in &s;ub&s;tance, that he believed it was to be doubted whether the legi&s;la|ture would undertake actually to contract for any of the vacant public lands, and that the doubt was &s;till &s;tronger re&s;pecting the&s;e lands, the Indian claim to which had not been previou&s;ly extingui&s;hed. He &s;tated to Mr. Jones that, by rea&s;on of &s;ickne&s;s in his family, it was not probable he &s;hould attend the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of Congre&s;s; at all events, however, he advi&s;ed Mr. Jones not to make an early application, as it was probable the &s;ubject of di&s;po&s;ing of the public lands would occu|py the attention of Congre&s;s, during the then en&s;uing &s;e&s;&s;ion; and that, by the delay, Mr. Jones could form a more correct judgment of the cour&s;e which it would be mo&s;t eligible for him to pur&s;ue, relative to this &s;ubject. That while the informant was waiting on Mr. Jones to the door, at his departure, Mr. Jones a&s;ked him if there would be any impropriety in a member of Congre&s;s be|ing concerned in an application for a grant of lands? The informant an&s;wered, that it would depend on the circum&s;tances under which the application was made; proper, if the application was made to a land-office, but
<PB N="27" REF="031364_0026_0FEC4505E4DE3798">
otherwi&s;e, if to the legi&s;lature; becau&s;e in the latter ca&s;e it would be for a man to contract with him&s;elf: to this an&s;wer Mr. Jones gave an explicit a&s;&s;ent. That the in|formant never at any time before or afterwards, to his remembrance, &s;aw the &s;aid Whitney, until he &s;aw him in this city, during the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion. That the inform|ant came from his own home to New-York, in compa|ny with col. Pepoon, &s;tated by the &s;aid Whitney, as one of his a&s;&s;ociates. That the informant hath been inform|ed and believes that the &s;aid Pepoon is now in this city; but that he had never &s;poken to the informant on the &s;ubject of the &s;aid land &s;peculation. That not long after the arrival of the informant in this city, the &s;aid Whit|ney, one morning waited on him, and &s;tated to him an intended memorial re&s;pecting the tract of land afore&s;aid, and urged on the con&s;ideration of the informant, the motives of a public nature for a grant thereof. That the informant enquired of the &s;aid Whitney, to what &s;tate he belonged, and being an&s;wered to Vermont, he recommended to him to reque&s;t the repre&s;entatives of that &s;tate to pre&s;ent his memorial. That the &s;aid Whit|ney reque&s;ted the informant to peru&s;e his memorial when it &s;hould be prepared, which he under&s;tood was not then the ca&s;e. That he an&s;wered, according to his be&s;t re|collection, that whenever he had lei&s;ure he &s;hould be willing to do it; or to that effect. That the whole time of the interview he believes did not exceed &s;ix, he is very confident, could not exceed ten minutes. That twice afterwards, the informant's &s;ervant informed him, that the &s;aid Whitney wi&s;hed to &s;ee him, and that he cau&s;ed him&s;elf to be denied; and the informant is very confi|dent he never undertook either to draft, or to pre&s;ent any memorial, for the &s;aid Whitney.</P>
<P>On the morning of the twenty-eighth of December, Mr. Smith of South-Carolina, informed the informant of what he afterwards &s;tated in evidence to the Hou&s;e, re&s;pecting Robert Randall. The informant advi&s;ed Mr. Smith, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, to make the &s;ame known to the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, (which Mr. Smith inform|ed
<PB N="28" REF="031364_0027_0FEC4508D65479F8">
the informant he had determined to do) and the in|formant having previou&s;ly advi&s;ed the &s;aid Whitney to apply to the Repre&s;entatives of Vermont, he thought it his duty, and he accordingly took the earlie&s;t opportu|nity to reque&s;t Mr. Smith of that &s;tate, to avoid pre|&s;enting any memorial with which he might be entru&s;ted for a grant of land, and de&s;ired him to make the &s;ame reque&s;t to Mr. Buck, the other member from the &s;ame &s;tate.</P>
<P>The informant further declares, that he never, to his remembrance, &s;aw Robert Randall, till he &s;aw him at the bar of the Hou&s;e.</P>
