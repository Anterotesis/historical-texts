<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>PSALM cxlvii. 16, 17.</HI></BIBL>
<P>He giveth Snow like Wool; he &s;cattereth the hoar Fro&s;t like A&s;hes.</P>

<P>_THE Glories of God the Creator, are every where &s;een in his Works, and preached in his Word. Look where we will in his World, we &s;ee them; and attend where we will to his Word, and we hear them. The holy Scriptures begin with the Declaration, That <HI>In the Beginning God created the Heavens and the Earth;</HI> and the Account is carried on, and inter&s;per&s;ed thro' all the &s;acred Pages. The Honours of God are here celebrated, in his
<PB N="6" REF="005354_0003_10170F68F1ACA4F0">Power and Sovereignty, and creating Attributes. P&s;al. lxxiv. 16, 17. <HI>The Day is thine, the Night al&s;o is thine: Thou ha&s;t prepared the Light and the Sun: Thou ha&s;t &s;et all the Borders of the Earth: Thou ha&s;t made the Summer and the Winter.</HI> The great Frame of Nature is the Work of God: He orders all the <HI>Motions</HI> of Nature, and is him&s;elf the fir&s;t Mover. He is the Owner and Proprietor of Nature then; and the Day and Night, the Light and Sun, the Summer and Winter are his.</P>
<P>But it is the Winter Scene that now opens. And the Skies and the Earth around, and the &s;acred Volume before us unite to claim our Honours to the God of Glory, as he appears grand at the Head of this Part of Nature and Pro|vidence, <HI>He &s;endeth forth his Commandment upon Earth; his Word runneth very &s;wiftly. He giveth Snow like Wool; he &s;cattereth the Hoar-fro&s;t like A&s;hes. He ca&s;teth forth his Ice like Mor&s;els; who can &s;tand before his Cold?</HI></P>
<P>The Theme before us is, <HI>GOD is adorable in the Scenes of the Winter.</HI> How does it appear? And what Evidence can we bring for it? It is proved every Way: And Con|viction pours in upon us from all Quarters. He has created it; He has e&s;tabli&s;hed it; He &s;till continues to bring it upon the Earth; He gives us the Sen&s;ation of it; a Capacity to feel it, in the Di&s;po&s;ition of our Bodily Or|gans: And he acts, and operates in all the &s;econd Cau&s;es, that con&s;pire to form it.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>He has created it.</HI> The Cold it &s;elf is a Creature of God. Some have argued Cold to be only the Privation of Heat, as Darkne&s;s is only the Privation of Light. But even in this Sen&s;e, God who forms the Heat and the Light, is the Author of the Cold and the Darkne&s;s. He lays his Claim, in the Letter as well as the Metaphor, <HI>I form the Light: I create Darkne&s;s.</HI> But there is &s;omething further in the Nature and Philo&s;ophy of Cold, than a bare Privati|on.
<PB N="7" REF="005354_0004_1017218AEB37DF90">A Non-entity and Cold one would think were diffe|rent. A <HI>cold Nothing</HI> were an ab&s;urd &s;ort of Curio&s;ity. Cold has really &s;omething material in its Nature; and it is not barely the Privation of Heat. The God of Nature has filled the Air with the Nitre, which &s;o penetrates the Pores, and even cuts the Skin, in the bleak Winds of the Winter. By this he &s;wells and fixes the frozen Water, and binds the Sea and Rivers in Fetters of Ice, bringing the Globules of the Fluid into that Attraction which we call Cohe&s;ion. He created the Cau&s;es of the Cold.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>He has e&s;tabli&s;hed the Winter.</HI> He formed all the Cau&s;es, and contrived all the Laws of it: And he has pro|claimed the Laws, and keeps them in Force and Authority. Gen. viii. 21, 22. <HI>The Lord &s;aid, While the Earth re|maineth, Seed time and Harve&s;t, and Cold and Heat, and Summer and Winter, and Day and Night &s;hall not cea&s;e.</HI> We know not how far the Flood it &s;elf contributed to this Inequality of Sea&s;ons, and brought the Sun and Earth to &s;lant to one another, as we find they now do: But this we know, that at the Flood the Law of Summer and Win|ter, was confirmed and e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P N="3">3. 'Tis he who <HI>&s;till continues to bring it upon the Earth.</HI> He keeps up the Performance of his own Laws, and leads on the Summer and Winter in their perpetual Circle. The Wheels of Nature would &s;tand &s;till, were it not for his powerful and unerring Hand: But having fir&s;t com|municated Motion to them, he maintains it, and keeps them rolling to this Day. The <HI>&s;teady</HI> Return of the annu|al Cold, is a Proof that there is &s;ome intelligent Agent at work, to bring it &s;o orderly and u&s;efully onward. The whole Voice of modern Philo&s;ophy, is aloud for this, that the Motion of the heavenly Globes is owing to the per|petual Energy of God. It is demon&s;trable from Princi|ples of Nature, that &s;hould the great God &s;pend his
<PB N="8" REF="005354_0005_1017219C9FE1CDE0">Power one Moment, all the Planets would leave the Sun, and &s;catter thro' Immen&s;ity. Summer and Winter would cea&s;e in a Moment, and the Inhabitants of the Earth would wonder to &s;ee the Sun le&s;&s;en &s;o fa&s;t to them, as our Globe, &s;hot off in a right Line, into eternal Cold and Darkne&s;s. What &s;hall I &s;ay! Should the great God withdraw his Operations, we &s;hould no more have the Sun go off and return as the Cau&s;e of Winter and Summer: But on the contrary, the Earth and Sun would &s;eparate forever, and retire to further and further Di&s;tances in the immen&s;e Space, to all Eternity. God, then, who &s;till keeps the Sun, (to &s;peak in the Language of the Vulgar) in its Circle, and makes it approach and retire; makes it &s;hine a&s;lant, or direct, is the Author of the Summer and the Winter. He made the Winter: For he is &s;till forever at Work to bring it on us. Not only did he create it at fir&s;t; and e&s;tabli&s;h it by a &s;tated Law; but he &s;tills puts this Law in Execution. He <HI>makes</HI> the Winter: He made <HI>This</HI> Winter. He does not leave the Year to run Riot; but &s;till orders and produces and changes all the Sea&s;ons.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>He has made the Power in us to perceive the Scenes of Winter.</HI> He has given us the Faculties of Sen&s;ation, to hear the Tempe&s;ts roar, to &s;ee the Snows de&s;cend, and to feel the chill and cutting Bla&s;ts. To what Purpo&s;e would the material Scenes of the Winter be, if our Organs were not di&s;po&s;ed and adapted to perceive them? Nay, if our Souls were not furni&s;hed with a Power of forming Ideas from them, different from what are in the Objects them&s;elves? There is, in our Perceptions of Cold and Heat, no Con|nexion between the material Object, and the conceived Idea, but the unaccountable Will of God. He it is, who has made the Snow, and the Winds, and the Cold; and he it is that gives us the Power to perceive them. <HI>He</HI> has filled the Winter Sky with the pointed Fro&s;t, and
<PB N="9" REF="005354_0006_1017218C77A6E708">impregnated it with the Particles of Nitre: And he has given us the Power to apprehend Cold, from the&s;e diffe|rent Cau&s;es. We depend upon him to keep the&s;e Sen&s;es in Exerci&s;e; for it is the continual Exertion of his Power by which they act. Our Sen&s;es are the Springs of the&s;e Perceptions; and in this Sen&s;e, <HI>All our Springs are in him.</HI> He keeps them acting, as he at fir&s;t awakened them in us. He ranged and modified our Nerves; he filled them with the animal Spirits; he formed the Imagination &amp; Fancy in us, by a Combination of all which, we feel the Cold, and &s;hudder at the keen Winter. He fir&s;t contrived the &s;mall pointed Matter, and then he contrived our Pores to re|ceive the&s;e little Particles; then he formed our animal Spirits to convey the Sen&s;ation to our Brain; and after all he lighted up the Imagination, to perceive the Idea, and pronounce upon it, <HI>Cold.</HI> Thus is the great God adorable in the Winter. 'Tis all his &s;trange Work, within us, and without us. 'Tis intricate, and my&s;te|rious! We know but Part of his Ways; nor can we find them out unto Perfection. We amu&s;e our &s;elves, and wonder, and adore. Our Philo&s;ophy reaches a little Way: And where that cea&s;es, our Devotion goes on, and our A&s;cription to God mu&s;t &s;till be, 'Tis <HI>His</HI> Ice, 'tis <HI>His</HI> Cold.</P>
<P N="5">5. He has <HI>made all tho&s;e Things which unite to form the Winter.</HI> The Cold, the Snow, the Winds, the Fro&s;t and Ice, the Nitre in the Air, the Obliquity of the Sun, and all the &s;hivering Attendants of the Winter, are the Pro|ductions of his Hand. <HI>For he &s;aith to the Snow, be thou on the Earth,</HI>&mdash;Job xxxvii. 6,&mdash;10. 'Tis all a&s;crib'd to God, to the Voice of God, to the Breath of God. The Snow falls, and the Ice thickens at his great Command: And by his Cold he &s;eals up the Hand of every Man, and puts a Stop to his Work. As &s;oon as ever his Word is
<PB N="10" REF="005354_0007_1017219E3573D298">given, all the Terrors of the bleak Winter, collect and mu&s;ter together. <HI>He &s;endeth forth his Commandment upon Earth, his Word runneth very &s;wiftly:</HI> Swift as his Com|mand, his Creation obeys him, and performs his &s;overeign Order. He bids his Wind blow, and the &s;tormy Wind fulfills his Word. It ru&s;hes out, and roars aloud; it blu&s;ters and &s;weeps the Earth, and battles in the Air; it rai&s;es the Ocean, to&s;&s;es up the Billows in white Foam, and da&s;hes Wave upon Wave, and Cloud upon Cloud. If he enlarges his Commi&s;&s;ion, it roots up Fore&s;ts, and a whole Grove &s;hall fly before it's Rage; and Cities &s;hall be overturn'd and laid wa&s;te in an In&s;tant. In all this, the lawle&s;s Tumult of the Winds is &s;trictly govern'd by God: They do but blow his Prai&s;es, as with the Sound of a Trumpet. When he Commands, they retire, and are hu&s;h; a profund Calm en&s;ues; not a Whi&s;per, not a Breath of Air moves a Sprig of the Trees, or bends the Smoaks of the Chimneys: The Sea &s;mooths its &s;hining Surface, and the Sky gleams &s;erene in Silence. 'Tis this &s;ame God, who orders his Cold to chill the Air, and &s;trip the Fore&s;ts: To arre&s;t the Rivers in their rapid Motion, and bind them in Fetters of Ice: To &s;eize the living Cre|ation, &s;lacken the Motion of the Blood, and make the Limbs &s;hake, and the Teeth chatter. 'Tis this &s;ame God, who makes his &s;nows gently de&s;cend, &s;port in the light Air, and whiten the &s;oft Ground. At his Order, the beautiful Fleeces cover the Fields with a dazling and a warm Robe. He it is, that forms the &s;lippery and gli&s;ter|ing Paths, and fini&s;hes the Looks and the Form of the rugged Lan&s;kip. Every little Ri&s;ing about us, the Banks of Snow, or the &s;hining Ice, are the common Works of him, the God who made the Winter. He has made all the various Parts of it, and furni&s;hed and compleated the whole Scene.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="005354_0008_1017218F9AE7E4C8">
Thus I have illu&s;trated and confirmed the Doctrine; I come now to apply it to the holy Ends of Plety and De|votion.</P>
<P N="1">1. Learn the <HI>adorable Perfections of this GOD.</HI> See his Grandeur and Maje&s;ty, in the terrible Work! How con|temptuous is his Challenge to mortal Man, in tho&s;e Ope|rations of his Hands? Job xxxviii. 22, 23. <HI>Ha&s;t thou en|tred into the Trea&s;ures of the Snow? Or ha&s;t thou &s;een the Trea&s;ures of the Hail? Which I have re&s;erved again&s;t the Time of Trouble, again&s;t the Day of Battle and War?</HI> How grand and maje&s;tick is the God who has &s;uch Magazines of Artillery; &s;uch Armies of various De&s;truction all at his uncontroulable Command. See the Winter, and own the almighty Power and of the God who produced it. What a re&s;i&s;tle&s;s Arm mu&s;t he have, who rolls on the Sea|&s;ons in their Order, and forms all the &s;trong Cold, and Wind, and Fro&s;t of the Winter? <HI>Who can &s;tand before his Cold?</HI> Who then can &s;tand before him when once he is angry? Who knows the Power of his Anger? Even as his Fear, &s;o is his Wrath.</P>
<P>See the Winter, and own the Mercy of God, to bring Good out of Evil, and make it beneficial to the Fruitful|ne&s;s of the Year, and the Health of Mankind. See his Mercy in providing us Shelter from the keen Air, and Cloaths as the Covering from the Cold. He has built our Hou&s;es for us; el&s;e had the Artificers laboured in vain. He has given us Fire to oppo&s;e the Cold, and defend us from its un&s;ufferable and mortal Rigour. He gave our fir&s;t Father Coats of Skin, and he gives us all our u&s;eful and beautiful Raiment, to hide us from the fatal Cold. The Winter all over &s;hews the Mercy of the God who made it.</P>
<P>See the Winter, and behold his Ju&s;tice al&s;o. 'Twas for Sin that Cold became painful, and executes part of the Cur&s;e upon the barren Earth. 'Tis not improbable, that
<PB N="12" REF="005354_0009_1017219FC60C7640">the Po&s;ition of the Earth to the Sun, has been altered &s;ince the Sin of <HI>Adam:</HI> And how far the Flood which came up|on the World of the Ungodly, has contributed to this, is di&s;puted among the Learned. 'Tis no unfair Conjecture, that the Di&s;ruption of the Aby&s;s, and the general Con|cu&s;&s;ions of the Globe at that Time, might unhinge the Poles, and alter the Cour&s;e of the Year. Perhaps this is hinted at, when God &s;aid to <HI>Noah</HI> immediately after the Flood, that now there &s;hould be no Ce&s;&s;ation of Winter and Summer, and Cold and Heat. However that may be, we know the Cur&s;e on the Earth for Sin, became more compleated by the Flood, which has very much alter'd the Form of the Earth, and the Healthine&s;s of the Air; and &s;hortned the Life of Man. And we know the Painfulne&s;s and Unfruitfulne&s;s of the Winter Cold, is Part of that Cur&s;e brought upon us by Sin. But I would not enlarge; let us &s;ee the Perfections of God in his Work.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let us <HI>&s;erve God in the Winter.</HI> It is his Time: We ought then to render it to him, and fill it up in his Service. 'Twas for his own Glory that he made it: For this is his End in all his Works. <HI>For his Plea&s;ure they are and were created.</HI> 'Tis ju&s;t then that we &s;hould make the Winter conduce to his Glory, and glorify him in it, and for it. We are apt indeed to be rendred &s;luggi&s;h and &s;loathful by the Winter-Cold. Prov. xx. 4. <HI>The Sluggard will not Plough by rea&s;on of the Cold.</HI> But far be this Cha|racter from us! Amid&s;t the Cold let us be diligent: not &s;lothful in Bu&s;ine&s;s, but fervent in Spirit, &s;erving the Lord. Let not our Love wax cold with the Sea&s;on. Away with the invidious Proverb, <HI>Cold as Charity.</HI> Let us now, as far as God gives us Capacity and Opportunity, relieve the Nece&s;&s;ities of our poor Neighbours. If a Brother of Si&s;ter be naked and de&s;titute of daily Food,
<PB N="13" REF="005354_0010_1017219131D72F90">and one of you &s;ay, Be ye warmed, be ye cloathed, not|with&s;tanding ye give them not tho&s;e Things which are nece&s;&s;ary for the Body, what doth it profit? Your Faith is dead, unle&s;s it in&s;pires the&s;e Works. And the great Demand of Chri&s;t at la&s;t will be concerning the&s;e Works and Labours of Love. And as we, in the&s;e In&s;tances, deal by his Members, he will look upon him&s;elf honoured or abu&s;ed.&mdash;<HI>I was naked, and ye cloathed me not</HI>&mdash;Or, <HI>I was naked, and ye cloathed me. Ina&s;much as ye have done it unto one of the lea&s;t of the&s;e my Brethren, ye did it unto me.</HI> Then &s;hall not a Cup of cold Water lo&s;e its Reward, much le&s;s &s;hall a warm Garment, or a comfortable Fire, or a refre&s;hing Meal.&mdash;And as there are Duties peculiarly adapted to Winter, I &s;hall conclude with a few profitable Meditations pertinent to the Sea&s;on. We may &s;erve God, in his Winter, by making the Winter it&s;elf con|tribute to our &s;acred Contemplations.</P>
<P>For In&s;tance, When we feel the <HI>Cold</HI> of the Winter, let us fear the God who made the Cold. How ea&s;ily can he kill us by this one Creature? There have been In|&s;tances of Per&s;ons pa&s;&s;ing over the northern Mountains, &s;eized and &s;tiffened at once, and left like <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife, a Pillar to be wonder'd at in after Years. In a dreadful Sen&s;e, they <HI>&s;tand</HI> before his Cold; &s;tand <HI>by</HI> it, and are <HI>kept</HI> &s;tanding, the Monuments of his awful Power.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>So Dr. WATTS has de&s;cribed them.</P>
<LG>
<L><HI>Fly to the polar World, my Song,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And mourn the Pilgrims there, (a wretched Throng)</HI></L>
<L><HI>Seiz'd and bound in rigid Chains,</HI></L>
<L><HI>A Troop of Statues on the</HI> Ru&s;&s;ian <HI>Plains.</HI></L>
</LG></NOTE> Who would not fear this God!</P>
<P>When we &s;ee the <HI>Snow</HI> around us, let us meditate on the un&s;potted Holine&s;s of the God who made it. The
<PB N="14" REF="005354_0011_101721A4867CA118">Snow is not pure in his Sight. Let us reflect on our own Guilt &amp; Blackne&s;s, &amp; take up the Prayer, P&s;al. li. 7. <HI>Wa&s;h me, and I &s;hall be whiter than the Snow.</HI> Let us plead the Promi&s;e of God, <HI>Though your Sins be as Scarlet, they &s;hall be white as Snow.</HI> Let us repair to Chri&s;t for his un&s;ullied Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, as the fine Linnen white and clean, which is the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Saints. Let us &s;eek Sanctifica|tion of the Holy Spirit, that we may be <HI>Nazarites purer than Snow.</HI></P>
<P>When we &s;ee the Ice &s;hine in the &s;lippery Paths, let us be caution'd to walk with Care; and remember the Admonition of God, <HI>Let him that &s;tandeth, take Heed lea&s;t he fall.</HI> Let the &s;hort Days of the Winter admoni&s;h us, to work in ha&s;te, and what we do, do quickly. Let the &s;lippery Paths and the &s;hort Days unite to per&s;wade us, to walk circum&s;pectly, redeeming the Time. This I &s;ay, Brethren, the Time is &s;hort; Oh! &s;hall we not fill up the &s;hort Time as full as ever we can. Let the cold Day put us in Mind of the Cold of Death; and the &s;hort Day of our &s;hort Life.&mdash;But I con&s;ider the Cold, and I would <HI>not &s;tand too long before it.</HI> Let us improve the Winter well in this World, and quickly we &s;hall be taken to that ble&s;&s;ed State, where the <HI>Winter</HI> &s;hall cea&s;e from tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">bling, and the Weary are at re&s;t. Death will arrive to us with that Me&s;&s;age from Je&s;us our Lord, Cant. ii. 10, 11. <HI>Ri&s;e up and come away, for lo, the Win|ter is pa&s;t, the Rain is over and gone, the Flowers appear on the Earth, and the Time of the &s;inging of Birds is come: Ri&s;e up, and come away.</HI></P>
