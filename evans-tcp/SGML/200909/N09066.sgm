<Q><P>The&s;e Remarks were written by two eminent Lawyers in one of our Colonies in <HI>America,</HI> immediately after the Publication of the Trial of Mr. <HI>Zenger,</HI> which it &s;eems had been indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread over that Part of the World, before it reached <HI>England!</HI></P>
<P>As the Doctrines contained in that Tryal, or rather in the Speech of Mr. <HI>Hamilton,</HI> are of &s;o new a Ca&s;t, and &s;o ab&s;olutely contra|dictory to all the Re&s;olutions, and Judgments, that have been &s;ettled and e&s;tabli&s;hed for &s;o many Ages, and by Judges of the highe&s;t Reputation, and mo&s;t unque&s;tionable Characters for their Integrity, Virtues, and Abilities; it could not be imagined, &s;o wild, and idle an Harangue, could have had any Weight, or have met with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> Reception here (i. e. in <HI>England</HI>) where the Laws, relating to Libels, have been &s;o often canva&s;&s;ed, and are generally &s;o well under&s;tood; and therefore the Per&s;on, to whom the&s;e Remarks were &s;ent, never thought of making any other U&s;e of them, than to &s;atisfy his own Curio&s;ity, and that of his Friends.</P>

<P>_IT has been a common Remark among tho&s;e who have ob&s;erved upon the capri|cious Di&s;pen&s;ations of Fortune, that great Events are often produced by In&s;tru|ments that are not &s;eemingly adequate; nay, that the &s;ame apparent Cau&s;es have quite contrary Effects, and the Road that leads one Man to Wealth, Honour, and Power, &s;ometimes carries another to Poverty, Infamy, and Ruin. Hence comes that confu&s;ed Di&s;tribution of Axes and Coronets, Halters and Ribbons; which Hi&s;tory di&s;plays by nu|merous &s;hocking Examples, and thus it is, that Fate &s;eems to play at Cro&s;s-Purpo&s;es with Mankind; or to &s;peak in Scripture Phra&s;e, in this Sen&s;e as well as many others, <HI>the Wi&s;dom of this World is Fooli&s;hne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="011573_0003_0F8746FB04627F60">I find my&s;elf drawn into the&s;e grave Reflections, Mr. <HI>Keim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> by reading the Tryal of <HI>John Peter Zen|ger,</HI> at <HI>New-York,</HI> upon <HI>an Information for printing and publi&s;hing a Libel.</HI> This Piece, it &s;eems, has been lately printed there, and was put into my Hands t'other Day, by a Friend who has both a general Acquaintance and a Corre&s;pondence with the north|ern Colonies, as a rare Production, containing many Things new and &s;urpri&s;ing. And in Truth, I mu&s;t &s;ay it affords a lively Specimen, in Miniature, of the Ju&s;tne&s;s of the foregoing Remarks; I mean that Part of it which is attributed to <HI>Andrew Hamilton,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of <HI>Philadelphia, Barri&s;ter at Law;</HI> together with the Sequal, de&s;cribing the munificent Behaviour of the Citizens in Common Council a&s;&s;embled, to the learn|ed Gentleman, for his &s;ingular Performance on that Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t at the &s;ame Time a&s;&s;ure you, that if <HI>Zenger</HI>'s Tryal had been printed by Order of the Court that tried him, or from a Copy taken by a private Hand

at the Tryal, or by any other Means that excluded Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s Approbation or Privity, I &s;hould have enjoy'd my own Opinion, without troubling you or any Body el&s;e about it, and had the Charity to re&s;olve all the Extravagancies that occur throughout his De|clamation, into a right Di&s;cernment of the People he talk'd to, and a Dexterity in captivating them, which had its Effect in the Acquittal of his Client. But when a Gentleman of the Bar takes the Pains to write over a long Di&s;cour&s;e (he being the only Lawyer of either Side who gave the Printer his Notes) in order to &s;end it abroad through the World, as a Spe|cimen of his Abilities, Sentiments, and Principles; as a &s;olemn Argument in the Law, fit to &s;ee the light and abide the Te&s;t in all Places, and above all, <HI>as a Ta&s;k of Duty,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Zeng. <HI>Tryal,</HI> P. 39. 41.</NOTE> <HI>which he thought him&s;elf bound to perform, even by going to the utmo&s;t Parts of the Land</HI> for the Purpo&s;e; and all this, <HI>without Fee or Reward, under the Weight of many Years and great Infirmities of Body:</HI> When a Barri&s;ter, I &s;ay, thus becomes a Volunteer for Error, and pre&s;umes to obtrude bad Law and fal&s;e Rea&s;oning upon the Sen&s;e of Mankind, becau&s;e the &s;age Magi&s;trates of <HI>New-York</HI> have put their Seal to it; I think my&s;elf at Liberty, without u&s;ing any other Apology, to exerci&s;e the judging Privilege of a Rea|der, &s;ince the Gentleman him&s;elf has put me into the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>In doing this, I &s;hall not in the lea&s;t gratifie a vain Itch of Writing, for there are no extraordinary Talents nece&s;|&s;ary for refuting gro&s;s Ab&s;urdities; but I &s;hall have the hone&s;t Merit of endeavouring to undeceive &s;uch of my Fellow Subjects in the Plantations as may; from the late uncommon Succe&s;s of the Doctrine, mi&s;take the Liberty of the Pre&s;s for a Licence to write and publi&s;h infa|mous Things of their Superiors, and of all others, at their Plea&s;ure, provided they write and publi&s;h nothing but what is true. In the next Place, I would pre|&s;erve, as far as I am able, the Dignity of the Profe&s;|&s;ion of the Law in the&s;e remote Parts of the Briti&s;h

Dominions; and prevent its learned Profe&s;&s;ors in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> who probably will &s;ee the renowned Piece above mentioned (if we may judge from the Indu&s;try u&s;ed in di&s;per&s;ing it) from &s;u&s;pecting that all their <HI>American</HI> Brethren u&s;e the like Arts to gain Popularity and ho|nourable Rewards. The former, having the Advant|age of going daily to the great School of Law at <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter,</HI> are already apt enough to think meanly of the Accompli&s;hment of the latter, who are far removed from In&s;truction; and their Opinion mu&s;t be &s;trongly confirmed in this Re&s;pect, if &s;uch a Rhap&s;ody as was utter'd at <HI>New-York,</HI> &s;hould not only be applauded and rewarded publickly there, but printed and &s;catter'd in Reams through the other Colonies, without being followed by a &s;uitable Animadver&s;ion.</P>
<P>Neither will it he ami&s;s to take &s;ome Notice in this Place of the Quackery of the Profe&s;&s;ion in general, without any particular Application, as it has been practi&s;ed with va&s;t Succe&s;s in &s;ome of our Colonies. You will often &s;ee (if common Fame may be tru&s;ted) a &s;elf-&s;ufficient enterpri&s;ing Lawyer, compounded of &s;omething between a Politician and a Broker, who making the Foibles of the Inhabitants his Capital Study, and withal taking Advantage of the Weak|ne&s;s of his Judges, the Ignorance of &s;ome of his Bre|thren, the Mode&s;ty of others, and the hone&s;t Scruples of a third Sort (without having any of his own) be|comes in&s;en&s;ibly an Oracle in the Courts, and acquires by Degrees a kind of Dominion over the Minds as well as the E&s;tates of the People. An Influence never to be obtained but by the help of Qualities very diffe|rent from Learning and Integrity. Where ever &s;uch a Man is found, the Wonder is not great, if from a long Habit of advancing what he plea&s;es, and having it received for Law, he comes in Time to fancy, that what he plea&s;es to advance is really Law.</P>
<P>Give me Leave, therefore, to be&s;peak two or three of your Papers, during this &s;hort Vacation between our Monthly Courts, that I may candidly examine this now Sy&s;tem of <HI>Libels</HI> lately compo&s;ed and propa|gated

<HEAD>From the <HI>Barbados</HI> Gazette, No. 439. <HI>Remarks on Zenger's Trial.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN con&s;idering the Defence made for the Defendant (Mr. <HI>Zenger,</HI> by his Council Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI>) upon <HI>not guilty</HI> pleaded to an <HI>Information for printing and publi&s;hing a Libel,</HI> it is not to the Purpo&s;e to enquire how far the Matters charged in the Information are in their Nature Libellous, nor whether the <HI>Innuendos</HI> are
<PB N="8" REF="011573_0005_0F8746FBDAFF1260">
properly u&s;ed to apply the Matters to Per&s;ons, Things, and Places. It is only nece&s;&s;ary to examine the Truth of this &s;ingle Propo&s;ition, upon which the whole De|fence is grounded, and to which the &s;everal Parts of it refer; namely, <HI>that the &s;everal Matters charged in the Information, are not and cannot be libellous becau&s;e they are true in Fact.</HI></P>
<P>This is the Cardinal Point, upon which the learned Gentleman's whole Argument turns,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zeng. Tryal. P. 17, 18, 30.</NOTE> and which he lays down over and over, as the fir&s;t Principle that governs the Doctrine of Libels; and accordingly he confe&s;&s;es the Printing and Publi&s;hing of the Papers laid in the In|formation, and puts it upon the King's Council to prove the Facts contain'd in them to be fal&s;e; alledg|ing at the &s;ame Time, that unle&s;s that were done, the Defendant could not be guilty; but if the &s;ame were prov'd to he fal&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 21. 22.</NOTE> he would own the Papers containing them to be Libels. To this, it &s;eems, the Attorney General, an&s;wer'd, <HI>that a Negative is not to be proved;</HI> and the latter replied in the&s;e Words, which I choo&s;e to &s;et down that I may not be thought to do him wrong.<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 22.</NOTE>&mdash;<HI>I did expect to hear that a Negative cannot be proved; but every Body knows there are many Exceptions in that gene|ral Rule: For if a Man is charged with killing another, or &s;tealing his Neighbour's Hor&s;e; if he is innocent in the one Ca&s;e, he may prove the Man &s;aid to be killed to be &s;till alive; and the Hor&s;e &s;aid to be &s;tolen, never to have been out of his Ma&s;ter's Stable, &amp;c. And this I think is proving a Negative.</HI> Now I mu&s;t think, in my turn, that it is &s;trange a Gentleman of his Sagacity, who owns he was prepar'd for the Objection, could not yet hit upon &s;ome of tho&s;e many Exceptions which every Body knows. For he does no more than give two In&s;tances of one Affirmative being de&s;troy'd by ano|ther that infers a Negative of the fir&s;t, at which Rate mo&s;t Negatives may be proved, and then the old Rule may be di&s;carded. Thus if it is &s;hewn that a
<PB N="9" REF="011573_0005_0F8746FBDAFF1260">
Man is alive, it follows clearly that he was not kill'd; and if a Hor&s;e is proved to have been always in his Ma&s;ter's Stable (for this is what mu&s;t be under&s;tood of his being never out of the Stable) it certainly fol|lows that he could not be &s;tolen. So that, according to this new Scheme of Proof, he who is accu&s;ed of killing a Man, or &s;tealing a Hor&s;e, is to be put upon proving that he did not kill or &s;teal; becau&s;e it is po&s;&s;ible that &s;uch Proof may be had &s;ometimes: And &s;o in the principal Ca&s;e, if a Que&s;tion ari&s;es whether a certain Magi&s;trate has done particular Acts of In|ju&s;tice or not, the Method is to &s;hew that he did not do &s;uch Acts, not that he did them. I have touch'd upon this, not for its Importance, but as a Specimen of the learned Barri&s;ter's Manner of rea&s;oning, and of the Spirit with which he &s;ets out from the beginning.</P>
<P>At length, however, he takes the <HI>Onus probandi</HI> upon him&s;elf, and rather than the Thing &s;hould go unproved, generou&s;ly undertakes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 24.</NOTE> at his Client's Peril, to prove the Matters charged in the Information as libellous, to be true. But I would be glad to know, by the Way, how this undertaking Gentleman could have proved the Truth of diver&s;e Facts contained in the Paper which the Defendant publi&s;hed, &s;uppo&s;ing the Court had been &s;o much over &s;een as to let him into a Proof of this Sort. Could he prove, for Example, that <HI>Judges</HI> were arbitrarily di&s;placed and new <HI>Courts</HI> erected, in the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> without Con&s;ent of the Le|gi&s;lature? For I am credibly inform'd, there never was a Pretence or Surmi&s;e of more than <HI>One Judge</HI> being di&s;placed, or more than <HI>One Court</HI> erected under Mr. <HI>Co&s;by</HI>'s Admini&s;tration, both which happen'd up|on one and the &s;ame Occa&s;ion. Now I would not have this e&s;teem'd a captious Exception, when I have to deal with a Man of Law, who mu&s;t or ought to know, that if &s;uch a Ju&s;tification as he offer'd were at all al|lowable, it ought to be full and expre&s;s, &s;o as to leave no Room for a Libeller to multiply and exaggerate Facts, at his Plea&s;ure, when he is di&s;po&s;ed to traduce
<PB N="10" REF="011573_0006_0F8746FD38553BF0">
Per&s;ons in Authority; there being a manife&s;t difference between a &s;ingle Act of Power without or again&s;t Law (from which perhaps few Governments have been free) and an habitual Abu&s;e of Power in repeated In|&s;tances of the &s;ame Species. I would further a&s;k, how he could prove <HI>that the Law it&s;elf was at an End, and that Tryals by Juries were taken away when a Governor plea&s;ed;</HI> for if I mi&s;take not, he was, at that Time &s;peaking to a Jury in a regular Court of Law, and in a Pro&s;ecution which the Governor had much at Heart (as the Gentleman him&s;elf in&s;inuates) and would have been highly plea&s;ed to convict his Client, yet would not attempt it but in the ordinary Cour&s;e of Tryal by a Jury, and then too could not find a Jury that would convict him. I think I am warranted in putting the&s;e Que&s;tions, even by the Authority of the Barri&s;ter him&s;elf,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 30, 31.</NOTE> who &s;ays&mdash;<HI>Truth ought to govern the whole Affair of Libels, and yet the Party accu&s;ed runs Ri&s;que enough, even then; for if he fail of proving every Tittle he has wrote, and to the Satisfaction of the Court and Jury too, he may find to his Co&s;t,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But for the pre&s;ent, I will &s;uppo&s;e Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI> was able to prove all the&s;e Things; nay that the Jury knew them all to be true. I will go further and allow, that Juries in criminal Ca&s;es may determine both Law and Fact, when they are complicated, if they will take &s;uch a Deci&s;ion upon their Con&s;ciences (which is almo&s;t the only Point in which I can have the Honour of agreeing with him) yet after all the&s;e Conce&s;&s;ions, the main Que&s;tion re&s;ts &s;till between us, viz. <HI>Whether a Writing can be a Libel, in legal Accep|tation, if the Matter contained in it be true.</HI> He is plea&s;ed indeed, to expre&s;s his Di&s;like of infamous Pa|pers, even when they are true, if levell'd again&s;t pri|vate Vices and Faults; and in this Ca&s;e he calls them <HI>ba&s;e,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 27. 28.</NOTE> <HI>unworthy, &s;candalous, unmanly and unmannerly.</HI> But &s;urely it might be expected, when a Point of Law was in Que&s;tion, that he would have told us whether they
<PB N="11" REF="011573_0006_0F8746FD38553BF0">
were lawful or unlawful, innocent or criminal, &s;ince the&s;e la&s;t are the only Epithets that were relative to his Subject, tho' the fir&s;t might have their Weight in a Sermon or moral E&s;&s;ay. But it is plain, he was aware of the Con&s;equence of being explicit upon this Head: for had he own'd &s;uch Writings to be lawful becau&s;e true, he would have alarmed the common Sen&s;e of Mankind, by opening a Door for expo&s;ing at Mercy, the Frailties, Vices, Defects and Misfortunes of every Per&s;on high and low, which mu&s;t inevitably de&s;troy the Peace of Families, and beget ill Blood and Di&s;|orders. If on the other Hand, he had acknowledg'd &s;uch Writings to be unlawful ina&s;much as they con|cerned private Mi&s;carriages and Tran&s;actions; but that every Man might write as much Truth as he plea&s;ed about the Admini&s;tration of the Government, not only by pointing out Faults and Mi&s;takes, but by publi&s;hing his own Comment and Inferrences in order to fill the Minds of the People with all the Jea|lou&s;ies and Apprehen&s;ions his Imagination can form; it mu&s;t have &s;hock'd Men of Under&s;tanding to be thus told, that the Law had provided again&s;t private Quarrels and Breaches of the Peace occa&s;ion'd by vi|rulent Writing, but had taken no Care to prevent Sedition and publick Di&s;turbances ari&s;ing from the &s;ame Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>His favourite Po&s;ition, however, was to be main|tain'd at all Events; and therefore when <HI>the Chief Ju&s;tice</HI> rightly in&s;tructed him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 22.</NOTE> that he could not be admitted to give the Truth of a Libel in Evidence, <HI>that the Law was clear that he could not ju&s;tify a Libel; for it is never the le&s;s a Libel tho' it is true;</HI> the di&s;cerning Gentleman was pleas'd to under&s;tand by the word <HI>ju&s;tify, a Ju&s;ti|fication by Plea, as it is in the Ca&s;e of an Indictment for Murder, or an A&s;&s;ault and Battery; there</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>the Pri&s;oner cannot ju&s;tify but plead not guilty: yet in Mur|der, he may prove it was in Defence of his Life, his Hou&s;e, &amp;c. and in A&s;&s;ault and Battery, he may give in
<PB N="12" REF="011573_0007_0F8746FDC0BF1210" MS="y">
Evidence that the other Party &s;truck fir&s;t, and in both the&s;e Ca&s;es he will be acquitted.</HI></P>
<P>If the Party in either Ca&s;e is acquitted, the Rea&s;on is I pre&s;ume, becau&s;e the Matter given in Evidence amounts to a Ju&s;tification in Law of the Fact charged on him, and is equivalent to a Confe&s;&s;ion and Avoid|ance in pleading. In like Manner, if Truth be a &s;ufficient Ju&s;tification of a Libel, the Defendant will be acquitted upon proving the Contents of his Paper to be true.<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 25.</NOTE> Now let it be ob&s;erved, that the Words of the Book which the Chief Ju&s;tice relied on are the&s;e&mdash;<HI>It is far from being a Ju&s;tification of a Libel, that the Contents thereof are true, &s;ince the greater Appearance there is of Truth in any ma|licious Invective, &s;o much the more provoking it is.</HI> That this is good Law, I hope I &s;hall be able to &s;hew fully hereafter, as I &s;hall &s;hew, in the mean Time, that it is an expre&s;s Authority again&s;t the well-read Barri&s;ter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 22.</NOTE> who declares, <HI>he has not in all his reading met with an Authority that &s;ays, he cannot be admitted to give the Truth in Evidence, &amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>The fir&s;t is the Ca&s;e of <HI>John de Northampton,</HI> 18 Ed. III.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zeng.

The Ca&s;e, however, &s;tands thus; <Q><HI>John de Northampton,</HI> an Attorney of the King's Bench wrote a Letter to one <HI>Ferrers,</HI> one of the King's Council, that neither Sir <HI>William Scot,</HI> Chief Ju&s;tice, nor his Fellows the King's Ju&s;|tices, nor their Clerks, any great Thing would do by the Commandment of our Lord the King, &amp;c. which &s;aid <HI>John</HI> being called, confe&s;s'd the Letter, &amp;c. <HI>Et quia praedictus Johannes cognovit dictam literam per &s;e &s;criptam, Roberto de Ferrers, qui e&s;t de concilio Regis, quae litero continet in &s;e nullam veritatem: Proetextu cujus Dom.

&amp;c.</Q> Here &s;ays the Barri&s;ter, <HI>by this Judgment it appears the libellous Words were utterly fal&s;e, and there the Fal&s;hood was the Crime, and is the Ground of the Judgment.</HI> For my own Part, I can neither &s;ee <HI>Truth nor Fal&s;hood</HI> in the Words at the Time they were wrote, for they refer to a future Contingency that might or might not be as he &s;aid; and in this Re&s;pect, they were the &s;ame as if the Man had &s;aid, the Roof of We&s;t|min&s;ter-hall would fall upon Sir <HI>William Scot,</HI> and his Fellows. Be&s;ides, the Words taken by them&s;elves have no ill Meaning; for I imagine it will be allowed that mo&s;t of <HI>the great Things</HI> which Judges do, as Jud|ges, are &s;uch as ought neither to be done nor left un|done by the King's Commandment. Where then was the Offence? The Record, I think, &s;hews that in the following Words; <HI>proetextu cujus Dom. Rex ergo Curi|am &amp; Ju&s;tic. &s;uos habere po&s;&s;et indignationem,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Idoe dictus Johannes committitur,</HI> &amp;c. It is ob&s;erveable, that the Author of this Letter was an Attorney of the Court, and by the Contents thereof he pre&s;umes to undertake for the Behaviour of the Judges in &s;ome great Matters that concerned their Office. The Letter was addre&s;s'd to a Per&s;on who was of the King's Council and might po&s;&s;ibly communicate the Contents of &s;uch a Letter to the King; the Con&s;equence of which might naturally be that; <HI>Dom. Rex habere po&s;&s;et indignationem ergo Cu|riam,</HI> &amp;c. for great Things were &s;ome Times done, in tho&s;e Days, by the Kings Commandment, and the Judges, be&s;ides, held their Po&s;ts at Will and Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The Words, <HI>quoe litera continet in &s;e nullam veritatem,</HI> were therefore proper for the Judges to in&s;ert, in Order to acquit them&s;elves to the King; but they are no more the Ground of the Judgment than the&s;e other Words; <HI>qui e&s;t de Concilio Regis,</HI> both being only incidental Clau&s;es that come in by way of Di&s;cription: For it is not &s;aid; <HI>quia litera praedicta continet in &s;e nullam veri|tatem.</HI> After all, I would not have this Con&s;truction of the Ca&s;e, plain and natural as it is, pa&s;s meerly upon my own Credit; for I &s;hall &s;hew that this Ca&s;e was &s;o under&s;tood by one of the greate&s;t Lawyers of his

<P>The Plaintiff brought an Action upon the Ca&s;e again&s;t the Defendant, for delivering of a &s;candalous Writing to the Prince, &amp;c. <HI>Noy</HI> for the Plaintiff cited, 18 Ed. III. a Letter was &s;ent to <HI>Ferrers,</HI> one of the King's Council, the Effect of which was, that <HI>Scot,</HI> Chief Ju&s;tice, and his Companions of the &s;ame Bench, would not do a vain Thing at the Command of the King; <HI>yet becau&s;e he &s;ent &s;uch a Letter to the King's Council, altho' he &s;pake no Ill, yet becau&s;e it might incen&s;e the King again&s;t the Judges, he was puni&s;hed.</HI> If no Ill was &s;aid, will it be pretended that the Fal&s;hood of what was &s;aid could be a Rea&s;on for puni&s;hing a Man? Is it not ridiculous to &s;ay that the Fal&s;hood of inno|cent or in&s;ignificant Words can be Criminal? This Book therefore follows the Record of <HI>Northampton</HI>'s Ca&s;e, and &s;ays; becau&s;e it might incen&s;e the King again&s;t the Judges, he was puni&s;h'd; which is almo&s;t a Tran&s;lation of <HI>praetextu cujus,</HI> &amp;c. which was the Ground of the Judgment, <HI>Idio Committitur.</HI></P>
<P>The next Ca&s;e which the Barri&s;ter called to his Aid, is that of <HI>the Seven</HI> Bi&s;hops; <HI>State Tryals,</HI> vol. 4. and here he relies on a Flouri&s;h of one of the Council for the Bi&s;hops, and a dubious Expre&s;&s;ion of one of the Judges, &s;eparated from the Re&s;t of his Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Robert Sawyer,</HI> 'tis true, &s;ays <HI>both the Fal&s;ity of it</HI> (the Libel) <HI>and that it was malicious and &s;editious, are all Matters of Fact, which they</HI> (the King's Council) <HI>have offer'd to the Jury no Proof of,</HI> &amp;c. This I mu&s;t confe&s;s, proves one Point to which the Barri&s;ter adduced it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 23.</NOTE> viz. <HI>That he was not the fir&s;t who in&s;i&s;ted, that to make a Writing a Libel, it mu&s;t be fal&s;e.</HI> And when I have allow'd this, I may almo&s;t venture to &s;ay, it is the only Point he does prove from the Beginning to the Ending of his long elaborate Speech. Let me, however, oppo&s;e to this the Reply of Sir <HI>Thomas Powis,</HI> in the&s;e Words; <HI>whether a Libel be true or not, as to the Matter
<PB N="17" REF="011573_0009_0F8746FEDD615CC0" MS="y">
of Fact; was it ever yet permitted in any Court of Ju&s;|tice to be made a Que&s;tion; whether the Party be pu|ni&s;hable for it? And therefore I wonder to hear the&s;e Gentlemen &s;ay, that becau&s;e it is not a fal&s;e one, therefore it is not a Libel.</HI> Fol. 382.</P>
<P>Mr. Ju&s;tice <HI>Powel</HI> al&s;o does &s;ay; <HI>that to make it a Libel, it mu&s;t be fal&s;e; it mu&s;t be malicious; and it mu&s;t tend to Sedition.</HI> Upon which Words of this learned and worthy Judge, I would not pre&s;ume to offer any Comment, except that which other Words of his own afford, that plainly &s;hew in what Sen&s;e he then &s;poke. His &s;ub&s;equent Words are the&s;e: <HI>They</HI> (the Bi&s;hops) <HI>tell his Maje&s;ty it is not out of Aver&s;ene&s;s to pay all due Obedience; nor want of Tenderne&s;s to their di&s;&s;enting Fellow Subjects; but becau&s;e they do conceive the Thing that was commanded them, was again&s;t the Law of the Land; they &s;ay, they apprehend the Declaration is illegal, becau&s;e it is founded on a di&s;pen&s;ing Power. I do not remember in any Ca&s;e in all our Law, that there is any &s;uch Power in the King; and the Ca&s;e mu&s;t turn upon that. In &s;hort, if there be no &s;uch di&s;pen&s;ing Power in the King, then that can be no Libel, which they pre&s;ented to the King, which &s;ays that the Declaration, being found|ed upon &s;uch a pretended Power, is illegal.</HI> So that the Judge put the whole upon that &s;ingle Point, whether it be true that the King had &s;uch a di&s;pen&s;ing Power, or not; which is a Que&s;tion of Law, and not of Fact; and accordingly the Judge appeals to his own Read|ing in the Law, not to Witne&s;&s;e&s;s or other Te&s;timony, for a Deci&s;ion of it. In Truth the Petition of the Bi&s;hops is not capable of having Fal&s;hood or Truth apply'd to it in any other Sen&s;e, there being nothing el&s;e affirm'd or deny'd in it, <HI>but that they thought they could not do what was commanded them, becau&s;e it was again&s;t the Law.</HI> This was the Behaviour; the&s;e were the Sentiments of that upright Judge, that gain'd him &s;o much Honour among all good Men, as the Barri&s;ter takes Notice, not any Opinion of his, that the Contents of a Libel mu&s;t be fal&s;e in Fact, to make it a Libel;<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 24.</NOTE> as he would unfairly in&s;inuate.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="011573_0010_0F8746FF9C316458">Sir <HI>Samuel Barnardi&s;ton's Ca&s;e</HI> is the third that is touch'd upon; and here too the Gentleman finds no|thing that can be &s;train'd to his Purpo&s;e, but the De|fendant's Council <HI>in&s;i&s;ting on the want of Proof to the Malice and &s;editious Intent of the Author.</HI> He &s;eems to have forgot that the &s;ame Gentleman in&s;i&s;ted al&s;o to have it proved, <HI>that the Defendant was a Per&s;on of a turbulent and unquiet Spirit,</HI> becau&s;e the&s;e Words were &s;et forth in the Information, and he takes no Manner of Notice how all this was an&s;wer'd; which I mu&s;t now do for him, in the Words of the Court; <Q>Cer|tainly the Law &s;upplies the Proof, if the Thing it&s;elf &s;peaks Malice and Sedition. As it is in Mur|der; we &s;ay always in the Indictment, he did it by the In&s;tigation of the Devil: Can the Jury, if they find the Fact, find he did it not by &s;uch In&s;tigation? No, that does nece&s;&s;arily attend the very Nature of &s;uch an Action or Thing. So in Informations for Offences of this Nature, we &s;ay, he did it fal&s;ely, maliciou&s;ly, and &s;editiou&s;ly, which are the formal Words; but if the Nature of the Thing be &s;uch as nece&s;&s;arily imports Malice, Reproach, and Scan|dal to the Government, there needs no Proof but of the Fact done; the Law &s;upplies the re&s;t. How &s;hall any Man prove another Man's Malice, which is a Thing that lies only in a Man's Mind? How &s;hould any Man know that I am malicious again&s;t the Government, but by my Actions?</Q> The&s;e Words, indeed, were pronounc'd by <HI>the Chief Ju&s;tice Jefferies,</HI> who was then the Mouth of the Court; but tho' he was really an intemperate Judge (or a <HI>Mon&s;ter,</HI> as the Barri&s;ter in <HI>his</HI> Bar-Language, delights to call him) yet I may &s;afely refer it to all Men of Law, whether the&s;e Words could have di&s;credited the be&s;t Mouth that ever &s;poke upon that Bench.

<P>An In&s;tance of this Sort may not be impertinent, where a Chief Ju&s;tice (who was no <HI>Mon&s;ter</HI>) addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to a Jury, that was trying a Libel, in this Manner; <Q>I will not repeat the Particulars to you,

There are &s;ome Things that you that are of the Jury are not to expect Evidence for, which it is impo&s;&s;ible to know but by the Act it&s;elf; Malice is conceiv'd in the Heart; no Man knows it, unle&s;s he declares it. As in Murder, I have Malice to a Man; no Man knows it. I meet this Man and kill him; the Law calls this Malice.

<P>But the Ca&s;e of Ca&s;es is &s;till behind, which he re&s;erved for the la&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 24.</NOTE> <HI>to make the Point clearer on his Side,</HI> than all the re&s;t put together could do. It is <HI>Fuller</HI>'s Ca&s;e.

For in this Ca&s;e the <HI>Cheat</HI> and the <HI>Impo&s;ture</HI> was the Offence, which con&s;i&s;ted wholly in the Fal&s;ity; that is, in affirming &s;uch Things for <HI>Realities,</HI> when they were nought but <HI>Fictions.</HI> On the contrary, had he been able to prove tho&s;e <HI>Letters</HI> and tho&s;e <HI>Depo|&s;itions</HI> to be authentic, the Di&s;covery would have been valuable, and might intitle him perhaps to Favour and Protection, in&s;tead of Puni&s;hment; however irregular he was in taking &s;uch a Method to publi&s;h Matters of that high Con&s;equence. After this, let the learned Barri&s;ter, <HI>in all his Reading,</HI> &s;hew an Information or Indictment for a <HI>Libel,</HI> where the <HI>Fal&s;ity</HI> is a&s;&s;igned in Form with an <HI>ubi revera,</HI> as the Foundation of the Offence; which is done in <HI>Fuller</HI>'s Ca&s;e; and then I will acknowledge that the Que&s;tions put here by <HI>Lord Holt,</HI> would have been proper upon the Tryal of his Client.</P>
<P>This is the Sum of the Barri&s;ter's Law-Ca&s;es. And is it not high Time to a&s;k, whether &s;uch gro&s;s Mi&s;re|pre&s;entations of the Books can proceed from Ignorance

<P N="1">1. It will not be improper to premi&s;e, under the fir&s;t Head, that a Gentleman of the Law, who takes upon him to pronounce &s;o magi&s;terially, as the Nor|thern Barri&s;ter has done concerning <HI>Libels,</HI> ought to have con&s;ider'd well the Nature and Extent of his

Subject. It might be expected that he is not unknow|ing in any Part of Learning nece&s;&s;ary to fix his Idea of a <HI>Libel</HI> And yet the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e would appear to be quite different. This learned Gentleman might have inform'd him&s;elf by reading &s;ome of the ancient Laws before the Conque&s;t, that when the <HI>Fal&s;ity</HI> of virulent Writings and Speeches was taken into the De&s;cription of the Crime, there was a &s;pecifick Pe|nalty annex'd, viz. <HI>Cutting out the Offenders Tongue.

<P>I know the Law Books a&s;&s;ert the Right of Com|plaining to the <HI>Magi&s;trates and Courts of Ju&s;tice,</HI> to the <HI>Parliament,</HI> to the <HI>King</HI> him&s;elf; but a Right of complaining to the <HI>Neighbours</HI> is what has not occur'd to me. After all, I would not be thought to derogate, by any Thing I have &s;aid or &s;hall &s;ay, from that noble Privilege of a free People, <HI>the Liberty of the Pre&s;s.</HI> I think it the Bulwark of all other Liberty; and the &s;ure&s;t Defence again&s;t Tyranny and Oppre&s;&s;ion. But &s;till it is a Two-edged Weapon, capable of cutting both Ways, and is not therefore to be tru&s;ted in the Hands of every di&s;contented Fool or de&s;igning Knave. Men of Sen&s;e and Addre&s;s (who alone de&s;erve publick Attention) will ever be able to convey proper Ideas to the People, in a Time of Danger, without running counter to all Order and Decency, or crying <HI>Fire</HI> and <HI>Murder</HI> thro' the Streets, if they chance to awake from a frightful Dream.

&s;uch a Ca&s;e cannot well happen, and has ne|ver yet happen'd among them.

<P>It is not always nece&s;&s;ary that particular Per&s;ons &s;hould leave their Affairs and Families in the Plantati|ons to pro&s;ecute a Governor in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall,</HI> un|le&s;s their Fortunes are equal to the Expence. For it is &s;eldom &s;een that the Violence of a bad Governor terminates in private Injuries; in as much as he can't find his Account in any Thing le&s;s than what is of a

general and publick Nature. And when this is the Ca&s;e, I hope none of our Colonies are, even at this Time, &s;o de&s;titute, but that they can find the Means of making a regular Application to their <HI>Sovereign,</HI> ei|ther in Per&s;on or in his Courts at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> as their Ca&s;e may require.</P>
<P>But the wild Incon&s;i&s;tency that &s;hines through mo&s;t Parts of this Orator's Speech,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 28.</NOTE> is peculiarly glaring in that Part of it now before me. The Remedy which he &s;ays our Con&s;titution pre&s;cribes for curing or preventing the Di&s;ea&s;es of an evil Admini&s;tration in the Colonies, I &s;hall give in his own Words; <HI>has it not been often &s;een (and I hope it will always be &s;een) that when the Re|pre&s;entatives of a free People are, by ju&s;t Repre&s;entati|ons or Remon&s;trances, made &s;en&s;ible of the Sufferings of their Fellow-&s;ubjects, by the Abu&s;e of Power in the Hands of a Governor, they have declared (and loudly too) that they were not obliged by any Law to &s;upport a Go|vernor who goes about to de&s;troy a Province or Colony,</HI> &amp;c. One would imagine, at fir&s;t Sight, that this Man had the &s;ame Notion, with the Re&s;t of Mankind, of ju&s;t Repre&s;entations and Remon&s;trances to the Repre&s;en|tatives of a free People, which has ever been under|&s;tood to be by Way of Petition or Addre&s;s directed and pre&s;ented to them in Form; in which Ca&s;e it is hoped that they, being moved by the Complaints of the People, will &s;tretch forth their Arms to help them. But alas!<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 29.</NOTE> We are all mi&s;tak|en; for he tells us, in the &s;ame Breath, that the right Way is by telling our Sufferings to our Neighbours, in Gazettes and News-Papers; for the Repre&s;entatives are not to be troubled with every In|jury done by a Governor; be&s;ides they are &s;ometimes in the Plot with the Governor, and the injured Party can have no Redre&s;s from their Hand; &s;o that the fir&s;t Complaint (in&s;tead of the la&s;t Re&s;ort) mu&s;t be to the <HI>Neighbours,</HI> and &s;o come about to the Repre&s;enta|tives through that Channel.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="011573_0018_0F874708A0F9F0B8">Now I would be very glad to know, what the <HI>Neighbours</HI> can do towards effecting the de&s;ired Refor|mation, that will be attended with &s;o good Succe&s;s and &s;o few ill Con&s;equences, as a regular Application to his Maje&s;ty would be. It would be plea&s;ant, doubt|le&s;s, to hear this Politician &s;peak out, and explain him&s;elf at large, upon this Subject. I confe&s;s it &s;ur|pa&s;&s;es my Comprehen&s;ion to conceive what the <HI>Neigh|bours,</HI> in&s;pired with weekly Revelations from the City Journali&s;t, can do with their Governor or A&s;&s;embly, unle&s;s it be to reform them by tho&s;e per&s;ua&s;ive Argu|ments which the <HI>Major vis</HI> never wants good Store of.

<P>In a Word; I &s;hall agree with the Barri&s;ter (and &s;o take my Leave of him) that <HI>the Liberty of expo&s;ing and oppo&s;ing arbitrary Power,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 39.</NOTE> is the Right of a free People; and he ought at the &s;ame Time to admit that, The order of Things and the Peace of Society require that extraordinary Means &s;hould not be u&s;ed, for this Purpo&s;e, till the Ordinary have failed in the Ex|periment. The &s;upreme Magi&s;trate of an <HI>independant Kingdom or State,</HI> cannot always be controul'd by the one, and then the other is ju&s;tified by that Con&s;ider|ation. But in <HI>Colonies,</HI> that are from their Creation &s;ubordinate to the Mother-Country, there is no Per|&s;on who is not controulable by regular and well known Methods of proceeding; and con&s;equently there can be no ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of flying to Extremities, at lea&s;t in the fir&s;t In&s;tance. From all which, I con|ceive, it follows, that <HI>local Con&s;iderations</HI> upon which the Gentleman lays &s;o great Stre&s;s, conclude directly again&s;t him; and I hope the Security which the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Con&s;titution affords to every Man's Per&s;on, Pro|perty, and Reputation, as well as to the publick Tran|quility, is not le&s;&s;en'd by any Di&s;tance from the Foun|tain of Power and Ju&s;tice; but that a <HI>Libel</HI> is a <HI>Libel,</HI> and puni&s;hable as &s;uch in <HI>America</HI> as well as in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IT mu&s;t be mortifying, no doubt, to a Per&s;on who has received peculiar Marks of public Approbation, to be told, that the very Act which procur'd it was &s;o far from being commendable, that it really de&s;erved a &s;evere Cen&s;ure; and one wou'd the rather decline &s;uch an Office, how ju&s;t &s;oever the Occa&s;ion, becau&s;e it cannot be done with|out condemning at the &s;ame Time, the Judgment of tho&s;e who&s;e Sufferage had been thus unworthily ob|tain'd. But when the Laws are openly perverted, and Courts of Ju&s;tice, with an Air of Gravity, <HI>droll'd</HI> out of their e&s;tabli&s;hed Rules by &s;uch who&s;e Profe&s;&s;ion &s;uppo&s;es them Mini&s;ters of Ju&s;tice, and when this too &s;hall be dignify'd with Applau&s;e, and made highly meritorious; I conceive neither good Nature, nor the Solemnity of <HI>public Seals</HI> &s;hould re&s;train an hone&s;t Pen from exploding the Practice, in Order as well to &s;top the Progre&s;s of its evil Effects, as to prevent the like Attempts for the future.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="011573_0020_0F87470A1D3EB990">Virtue and Merit, it is mo&s;t certain, ought to be encouraged, e&s;pecially by all in Authority; but when that which is meerly counterfeit &s;hall gain E&s;teem, &s;tand in the Room of what is truly genuine, and be actually loaded with the Rewards thereof, it does not only fru&s;trate the Original Intention of &s;uch Rewards, but likewi&s;e give Countenance to the Impo&s;tor, and furni&s;h him with &s;till further Means of vending his fal&s;e Wares, in Prejudice of the Public. Now this, with all due Submi&s;&s;ion, I take to be the Ca&s;e of the <HI>Corporation</HI> in <HI>North-America,</HI> with Regard to the Honours they were lately plea&s;ed to confer on a <HI>noted Barri&s;ter</HI> in tho&s;e Parts, for his &s;uppo&s;ed Services in the Affair of <HI>Zenger</HI> the Printer, who&s;e <HI>Tryal</HI> has been &s;o plentifully di&s;pers'd here, and in other Places. Ag|gregate Bodies, we find may be mi&s;taken, and too often are, as well as private Men; and when they do err, it is of the more dangerous Con&s;equence, on Account of the Extent of their Power and Influence. The Province in general of <HI>New-York,</HI> or the City in particular might, for ought I know, have &s;ufficient Cau&s;e of Complaint, in &s;ome Re&s;pects, again&s;t their then Commander in Chief and his Admini&s;tration; but it is to be con&s;idered that as there never was one ab&s;olutely free from Faults, &s;o it is the great Privilege of the Inhabitants of every <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Government that a proper Channel is chalk'd out, in all &s;uch Events, and a Way open for Relief. The Method therefore which the Con&s;titution pre&s;cribes ought to be &s;trictly pur&s;ued, and any illegal Deviation is not only incon|&s;i&s;tent and unju&s;tifiable in it&s;elf, but has, be&s;ides, a Tendency to introduce Mi&s;chiefs more to be dreaded even than tho&s;e that were &s;ought to be redre&s;s'd. It is the Law which mu&s;t be the Standard of Right and Wrong; and whoever has recour&s;e to any other Aid, or knowingly advi&s;es thereto, in the Ca&s;e of particular Grievances, cannot action a true Principle of publick Spirit, but mu&s;t be influenced by unworthy Motives, and is always more or le&s;s an Enemy to the Community, according to his Situation, and in Proportion to the
<PB N="39" REF="011573_0020_0F87470A1D3EB990">
Talents he happens to po&s;&s;e&s;s. If Mr. <HI>Zenger</HI> then will avowedly publi&s;h &s;editious Libels again&s;t the Go|vernment under which he lives, and his Council will offer to &s;upport him by Artifices unbecoming the long Robe, and advancing Propo&s;itions manife&s;tly contrary to Law; as the former de&s;erves to be puni&s;hed by it, &s;o the latter I humbly pre&s;ume to &s;ay, whatever he may claim from his Client, ought not to be paid his Wages by any Set of Men who owe their Being to the Law, and cannot exi&s;t without it.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall not &s;cruple to acknowledge here, and I do it on no &s;uperficial Ob&s;ervation, that there can't be a more pernicious Creature in a di&s;tant Colony, than that of a Practitioner of the Law, with much A&s;&s;urance, little Knowledge, and no Morals; a Cha|racter not unheard of in more than one of his Ma|je&s;ty's Plantations, and which yet I wou'd by no Means apply to Mr. <HI>Hamilton,</HI> any otherwi&s;e than may appear to be ju&s;t from the Performance he has, it &s;eems, taken &s;o much Pains to publi&s;h to the World. The judicious Remarks already made upon it, by <HI>Anglo-Americanus,</HI> will hardly leave Room for any Thing to be added that is very material, and therefore I &s;hall content my&s;elf with a few <HI>Gleanings</HI> only, and make &s;ome cur&s;ory Reflections thereon, whil&s;t they afford me an Opportunity of bearing my Te&s;timony al&s;o again&s;t what I think the mo&s;t undecent Behaviour at lea&s;t, if it may not be called the bolde&s;t Outrage that ever was exhibited from the Bar without a &s;uitable Cha&s;ti&s;ement.</P>
<P>Whoever has enquired into the Doctrine of <HI>Libels,</HI> and the Rea&s;on of their Puni&s;hment will perceive that they take their Degrees, as they affect private Per|&s;ons, particular Magi&s;trates, or are aim'd again&s;t the Government it&s;elf; and I may venture to &s;ay that no Lawyer of Reputation will deny, but what is &s;et forth in the Information again&s;t <HI>John Peter Zenger</HI> was of this la&s;t Kind, and that too, conceived in the gro&s;|&s;e&s;t Terms, &s;uch as will not admit of a different Con|&s;truction, or of any other meaning than what is put

upon them by the Pro&s;ecutor for the Crown. Now I am &s;en&s;ible that great Allowances are with good Rea&s;on made to Council in the Heat of Argument, and when &s;uppo&s;ed to be animated with a laudable Zeal for their Clients. Nor has it been u&s;ual to cor|rect them for every har&s;h and ha&s;ty Expre&s;&s;ion, pro|vided they keep within Bounds, and &s;tick to that which is their Duty without running into Matters that have no Relation to the I&s;&s;ue, and cannot fairly &s;erve the Side they e&s;pou&s;e. Yet, as the Lord Chancellor <HI>Not|ingham</HI> occa&s;ionally &s;aid, <HI>Council &s;hould not &s;peak as if they would abet the Guilt of their Client rather than Advocate for their Innocency.</HI> And &s;ince your ingeni|ous Corre&s;pondent, has clearly evinced that the Truth of a Libel cannot be given in Evidence, that it is no Ju&s;tification, on the general I&s;&s;ue, and con&s;eqently no proper Defence to a Charge of that Nature; of all which Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI> cou'd not, (or ought not to have been ignorant) it is worthy of Con&s;ideration whether he did not involve him&s;elf in his Client's Crime, and partake of his Guilt, by declaring in the mo&s;t publick Manner, that the Facts publi&s;hed in the News-Papers, and contain'd in the Information, were true, and offering to prove them to be &s;o before a Court which had no Power to redre&s;s the Grievances complain'd of. 4 <HI>Co.</HI> 14. <HI>Hob.</HI> 266, 7.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Bartholomew Shower,</HI> I remember in his Argu|ment in the Ca&s;e of the <HI>King</HI> again&s;t <HI>Berchet &amp; al.</HI> a&s;&s;erts, that <Q>in all Ca&s;es of Contempts to a Court, no Pre&s;entment is nece&s;&s;ary, no not &s;o much as to convict; for if done in <HI>Facie curiae,</HI> a Record may be made of it, and a Puni&s;hment judicially in|flicted, and that executed immediately. <HI>Show.

which was executed accordingly the la&s;t Day of the Term. <HI>Mod. Ca. in Law &amp; Eq.</HI> 179, 180. This is the more remarkable becau&s;e it was in the Court of Common Pleas, which has ordinarily no Juri&s;dic|tion in Criminal Ca&s;es&mdash;May it not from hence be inferr'd (I hint it with a due &s;aving to all the ju&s;t Privileges of the Bar) that the Court at <HI>New-York</HI> might well have recorded &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;editious Expre&s;&s;ions in Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s Rhap&s;ody, and com|mitted him for the &s;ame, &amp;c. If they had, I doubt the Blame mu&s;t have center'd in him&s;elf, and his own Conduct; of which therefore he might then have had lei&s;ure to repent, as well as of his <HI>long Journey</HI> to &s;o ill a Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>But it will not be ami&s;s perhaps, for Example Sake, to give an In&s;tance of what has been done on the like Occa&s;ion with that before us; and to this End I &s;hall cite a Ca&s;e in the Court of King's Bench, many Years after that of the Star-Chamber was at an End, and which in the Words of Sir <HI>Thomas Raymond,</HI> was as followeth; <Q><HI>Memorandum, June</HI> 18, 1680. Mr. <HI>Nathaniel Reading</HI> having been convicted (before Ju&s;tices of Oyer and Terminer by Virtue of a &s;pecial Commi&s;&s;ion) for endeavouring to per&s;uade <HI>Bedlow,</HI> who was a Witne&s;s again&s;t the Nobleman impri&s;on'd in the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> to forbear his Pro&s;ecution of them; and he the &s;aid Mr. <HI>Reading</HI> having had Judgement executed upon him by being &s;et in the Pillory, and fin'd 1000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> and impri&s;on'd for the &s;ame, but his Fine &s;ince pardon'd by the King, came this Day into Court, and demanded that an Information which he there brought in his Hand might be received by Mr. <HI>A&s;trey</HI> again&s;t the Commi&s;&s;ioners who condemn'd him, of which my Brother <HI>Jones</HI> and Brother <HI>Dolben</HI> were two, and that the Information may be filed. But the Court did declare that he was in the wrong Way to exhi|bit any Information in this Manner, and did cau&s;e his Words, whereby he did accu&s;e the two Judges of Oppre&s;&s;ion to be recorded; and for the&s;e Words,

and for that he was infamous by having been in the Pillory, the Gentlemen at the Bar did pray that his Gown might be pull'd over his Ears, he having been formerly a Practi&s;er at the Bar, which was ordered and executed in Court; and he was al&s;o condemn'd in Court to pay the King 500 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> and to lie in Pri&s;on till he paid it. <HI>Raym.

<P>It is now Time to take Notice, that there is amid&s;t a Heap of Jargon and Ab&s;urdities, one obvious Mi&s;|take which runs throughout Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s o&s;tenta|tious Harangue, and that is in Relation to the Court of Star-Chamber. He would &s;ugge&s;t that becau&s;e that Court was aboli&s;hed by Act of Parliament, on Ac|count of &s;ome in&s;ufferable Abu&s;es that had crept into it, all the Ca&s;es that had been adjudged there, on Informations for Libels, were con&s;equently of no Authority. Whereas the Judgments given there, in Matters properly cognizable before them, which Libel|ing e&s;pecially was, are allowed to be good Law at this Day, and are con&s;tantly quoted, as &s;uch, in the Court of King's Bench. Indeed it is &s;aid that the Rea&s;on of di&s;allowing the Star-Chamber Court, was becau&s;e their Authority was before and now is in <HI>B. R.</HI> and con&s;equently that Court unnece&s;&s;ary, <HI>Comb.</HI> 36. So the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Holt</HI> declared that <HI>B. R.</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;t all the lawful power the Star-Chamber had, <HI>Id.</HI> 142. And that the Court of Star-Chamber was taken away, becau&s;e the Crimes were puni&s;hable here, 5. <HI>Mods</HI> 464; which is likewi&s;e intimated by the Statute it&s;elf. Now tho' I am as well &s;atisfyed, perhaps, with the taking away of the Court of Star-Chamber, con&s;ider|ing the Occa&s;ion that had been given, as our northern Barri&s;ter can po&s;&s;ibly be, and &s;hould equally rejoice, I hope, at the redre&s;&s;ing any other public Grievance; yet I cannot, with him, condemn by the Lump, and argue, that becau&s;e that Court did &s;ome Things ami&s;s, therefore it did nothing right. At this Rate, every Court that had, or has a Being, may be in Danger of the &s;ame Epithets he loves to be&s;tow on that we are &s;peaking of; and it may as well be &s;uppos'd, that becau&s;e a certain Set of Citizens, not unknown to Mr. <HI>Hamilton,</HI> lately did a very <HI>&s;illy</HI> Thing, they therefore never did a <HI>wi&s;e</HI> one. For which Rea&s;on I pre&s;ume it will not be altogether impertinent to pro|duce

the Sentiments of that Oracle of the Law, Sir <HI>Edward Coke,</HI> concerning the Court of Star-Chamber. <HI>It is</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>the mo&s;t honourable Court, our Parliament excepted, that is in the Chri&s;tian World, both in Re&s;pect of the Judges, and of their honourable Proceedings accord|ing to their ju&s;t Juri&s;diction, and the ancient and ju&s;t Orders of the Court. For the Judges of the &s;ame are the Grandees of the Realm, the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Trea&s;urer, the Lord Pre&s;ident of the King's Council, the Lord Privy Seal, all the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and others of the King's mo&s;t honourable Privy Council, and the principal Judges of the Realm, and &s;uch other Lords of Parliament as the King &s;hall name. And they judge upon Confe&s;&s;ion, or Depo&s;ition of Witne&s;s. And the Court cannot &s;it for hearing of Cau&s;es, under the Number of eight at the lea&s;t.

<P>I need only add on this Head that the Crime of <HI>Libelling</HI> is the &s;ame now as it was while the Court of Star-Chamber &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, and the Nature of the Of|fence the &s;ame then, as now; a Crime that mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be puni&s;hed, as long as there are States and Communities e&s;tabli&s;hed in the World. And our a&s;&s;uming Barri&s;ter will not find an Author that treats of the Crown Law &s;ince the Statute of 16 <HI>Ch.</HI> 1. <HI>Ch.</HI> 10. any more than before, but makes u&s;e of the Ca&s;es adjudged in the Star-Chamber generally as good Law, and of equal Authority in tho&s;e Matters with &s;uch as were afterwards adjudged in the King's Bench.

<P>But the learned Lawyer of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> declares that <HI>he has not in all his reading, met with an Authority that &s;ays we cannot be admitted to give the Truth in Evi|dence upon an Information for a Libel.</HI> I don't know what this Gentleman's reading may be; but if he had read &s;ome of the Ca&s;es above mentioned which cou'd not well e&s;cape him, it might rea&s;onably have been expected he would have taken Warning, been a little more cautious, and not have ventur'd to incur the Penalties which others before him had &s;o ju&s;tly &s;uffer'd. By <HI>all his Reading,</HI> he wou'd in&s;inuate, I &s;uppo&s;e, that he had <HI>read all;</HI> and if that was true, it might well be thought he had read to very little Purpo&s;e, who
<PB N="47" REF="011573_0024_0F87470DE348F198">
could make &s;o ill an U&s;e of it; or think it <HI>a Duty on him to go to the utmo&s;t Part of the Land,</HI> to propagate Doctrines and Principles diametrically oppo&s;ite to, and ju&s;t the Rever&s;e of what he mu&s;t have read. We &s;hall &s;oon di&s;cover that the Barri&s;ter's Reading is not quite &s;o exten&s;ive as he would have it imagin'd. But it is previou&s;ly to be ob&s;erved that if there were no &s;uch Authority <HI>in terminis</HI> as that he calls for, a Man who reads with any tolerable Under&s;tanding wou'd of Cour&s;e infer the &s;ame Thing, when all the Books on the Subject of Libels lay it down as a Rule, which they unanimou&s;ly do, <HI>that it is not material whether the Libel be true or fal&s;e.</HI> For if that be not material, to what end &s;hou'd the Truth be offer'd in Evidence? Or how &s;hou'd it be rejected before, it was offer'd which undoubtedly is the Rea&s;on that there have been no late In&s;tances of that Sort. It might &s;uffice there|fore to undertake as often as this well-read Lawyer produced a Precedent of its being demanded from the Bar to give Evidence of the Truth of a Libel, to &s;hew that it was as often deny'd by the Court. And tho' I admit it has been attempted before, on Tryals for Libels of the le&s;s enormous Kinds, yet he is pro|bably the only one that has done it in any Ca&s;e within the&s;e 100 Years. However if we would find an In|&s;tance of that Sort, we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have Recour&s;e to the Proceedings of the Court where that Crime was u&s;ually puni&s;hed. The <HI>Star-Chamber Reports</HI> then may &s;atisfy Mr. <HI>Hamilton,</HI> that <HI>Term Pa&s;e.</HI> 7 <HI>Car.</HI> 1. there was the Ca&s;e of <HI>Co&s;ton,</HI> Gent. v. <HI>Hitcham Mil Servien. ad legem,</HI> as follows. <Q>The Defendant the Morning before he went to the Se&s;&s;ions, being a Ju&s;tice of the Peace, received &s;candalous and li|bellous Articles again&s;t the Plaintiff, carry'd them to the Se&s;&s;ions in his Pocket, and in open Court, in di&s;grace of the Plaintiff, pull'd them out, and &s;aid you &s;hall &s;ee what a lewd Fellow this is, and not fit to &s;peak in this Place, and then cau&s;e the &s;aid libellous Articles to be read in the publick Se&s;|&s;ions. And the Plaintiff then de&s;iring a Copy of
<PB N="48" REF="011573_0025_0F8746BB4BF33440">
them and to be try'd upon them, the Witne&s;&s;es to prove them being noted in the Margin, the Defen|dant did not &s;uffer him to have a Copy or to be try'd there upon, nor took any Cour&s;e that he might at the next Se&s;&s;ions, or at any Time after be que&s;tion'd for them, but took the Articles again out of the Se&s;&s;ions and carried them away. And after, further to di&s;grace the Plaintiff in his Practice (being an Attorney) &s;ent the &s;aid Articles to Mr. Ju&s;tice <HI>Harvey</HI> at the Reference of a Cau&s;e to him, which <HI>Ca&s;ton</HI> attended; and a Jury having given a Verdict again&s;t the Defendant, he &s;ent for the Jurors and que&s;tion'd them about their Verdict, and told them they were a Company of Fools, and that if there had been but one wi&s;e Man among them their Verdict had not been &s;o And for the&s;e Of|fences he was committed to the Fleet and fin'd 200 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> In this Cau&s;e, the Defendant wou'd have had Witne&s;&s;es to prove the Matter of the &s;aid &s;can|dalous Articles to be true, but that was di&s;allowed by the Court. <HI>Ru&s;hw Col vol.</HI> 3. <HI>P.</HI> 36. <HI>in Ap|pend.</HI></Q> This I pre&s;ume the Barri&s;ter when he is &s;erious will allow to be in Point, tho' it happen'd not to fall in the Way of his Reading. He cannot object &s;urely that it does not appear to be on an Information prefer'd by an Attorney General, &s;ince it is a much &s;tronger Ca&s;e than if it had. For if the Court would not receive &s;uch Evidence in a Cau&s;e depending on the Complaint of a petty Sollicitor for being libell'd, and this too preferred again&s;t a Ju&s;tice of Peace, a Knight and a Serjeant at Law, <HI>a fortiori,</HI> they wou'd never admit it on an Information exhibited by his Ma|je&s;ty's Attorney-General again&s;t a private Per&s;on for libelling the Government.</P>
<P>There was al&s;o as I have learnt, divers Years be|fore, viz. <HI>Mich.</HI> 2 <HI>Jac.</HI> the Ca&s;e of <HI>Peter B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">eton</HI> Clerk, for writing a &s;candalous Letter to <HI>Loyd</HI> Regi&s;|ter of the Bi&s;hop of St. <HI>A&s;aph,</HI> and &s;ent to him&s;elf, who was therein charg'd with Bribery and Extortion in his Office, for which libellous Letter the Defen|dant

was &s;entenc'd, tho' as the Book has it, <HI>he wou'd have undertaken to prove the Contents of the Letter to be true.</HI> Here then are two Precedents of what the Barri&s;ter him&s;elf had never met with in all his Read|ing; the one in a Ca&s;e for Libelling a practi&s;ing At|torney, and the other of the Regi&s;ter of a Bi&s;hop's Court; but I believe I may defy this Gentleman if he were to read as many more Years as he has done, to produce a <HI>third</HI> where the Offence under Pro&s;ecuti|on, being of the highe&s;t Degree, and levell'd at the Government, like that for which he was &s;o zealous an Advocate, the Council for the Defendant dar'd to offer Evidence of the Truth of it. On the contrary, if he had dipt into the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Keling</HI>'s Reports, Fol. 23. (before he left his Chambers) he would have there found it re&s;olv'd by the whole Court that <HI>tho' a Coun&s;ellor at Law may plead his Client's Cau&s;e again&s;t the King, yet if under Colour of that, he takes upon him to vent Sedition, he is to be puni&s;h'd.</HI></P>
<P>It is no Wonder indeed, if our Barri&s;ter &s;hou'd be unapprized of <HI>Brereton</HI>'s Ca&s;e, it not being (at lea&s;t to my Knowledge) in Print; and you perceive I was under no Nece&s;&s;ity of mentioning it, being before provided with an Authority to my Purpo&s;e. But it is reported as above, in <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Part</HI> II. <HI>Con&s;id.</HI> 12.</NOTE> Sir <HI>Thomas Mallet</HI>'s M. S. Treati&s;e of the Court of Star-Chamber, a Copy where|of has fallen into my Hands by the Favour of a Friend. And &s;ince I have named this Work, I &s;hall, with his Leave take a Paragraph out of it, which I'm per&s;uaded will not be deem'd un&s;uitable to the pre&s;ent Debate, after hinting that the Book &s;eems to be wrote in the Time of <HI>James</HI> I. when the Doctrine now revived, and &s;o tenaciou&s;ly advanced by Mr. <HI>Hamilton,</HI> is &s;aid to have been <HI>long before exploded as a gro&s;s Error.</HI> <Q>There are (&s;ays Sir Thomas) two gro&s;s Errors crept into the World concerning Libels; the one that it is no Libel if the Party put his Hand unto
<PB N="50" REF="011573_0026_0F8746BB5F9F61F8">
it; and the other that it is not a Libel if it be true; both which have been long &s;ince exploded out of this Court. For the fir&s;t, the Cau&s;e why the Law puni&s;heth Libels, is for that they tend to rai&s;e the Breach of the Peace, which may as well be done, and more ea&s;ily when the Hand is &s;ub&s;cribed, then when it is not. And for the other, it hath been ever agreed that it is not the Matter, but the Man|ner which is puni&s;hable. For libelling again&s;t a common Strumpet is as great an Offence as again&s;t an hone&s;t Woman, and perhaps more dangerous to the Breach of the Peace; for, as the Woman &s;aid, &s;he &s;hould never grieve to be told of her red No&s;e if &s;he had not one indeed. Neither is it a Ground to examine the Truth or Fal&s;hood of a Libel, becau&s;e it is <HI>&s;ub Judice,</HI> whether it be a Libel or not; for that takes away <HI>Subjectum Que&s;|tionis,</HI> and determines it to be no Libel, by admit|ting the Defendant to prove the Truth, and the Defendant in that Ca&s;e ought to plead a Ju&s;tifica|tion and Demur in Law; but if he plead not guilty, the Que&s;tion is gone, whether it be a Libel or not.</Q> Thus, according to this Author's Opinion, who if I mi&s;take not, was one of the Ju&s;tices of the Court of King's Bench in his Time, Mr. <HI>Hamilton,</HI> cou'd he really have per&s;uaded him&s;elf that the Matters charged in the Information were not libellous, as he <HI>in&s;i&s;ts they are not,</HI> would have di&s;covered more Accuracy in his Profe&s;&s;ion, as well as Candour in his Practice, by advi&s;ing his Client to <HI>Demur</HI> to it, whereby he wou'd have admitted no more than what was avowed at the Tryal on the general I&s;&s;ue. Then indeed it would have fairly come before the Court to be con&s;idered whether the Papers were libellous or not, and he as Coun&s;el for the Defendant, might regularly have been heard to it. He wou'd then have been at Liberty to exert his uncommon Talents, manife&s;t his extraor|dinary Reading, his &s;uperior Genius and great Skill in Language, and in explaining the true import of Words, without &s;o directly flying in the Face of every Autho|rity,
<PB N="51" REF="011573_0026_0F8746BB5F9F61F8">
and oppo&s;ing all the Ca&s;es that ever were adjudged concerning <HI>Libels,</HI> before he was born, and &s;ince. But, alas! That wou'd not have an&s;wered the Inten|tion of our eloquent Barri&s;ter. He wou'd not then have had it in his Power to u&s;e his Arts, and play his Game with a Dozen hone&s;t Men of as good natural Under&s;tandings perhaps, tho' not of equal Experience and Cunning with him&s;elf. If he had gone that way to Work, he wou'd have had no chance for the Prize. Vain had been his Expedition, and lo&s;t, entirely lo&s;t, all his Labour. In a Word, if the Learning and In|tegrity of the Bar only were required, he might as well have &s;tayed at home, where, if I am rightly in|form'd, their are In&s;tances in Abundance of the ble&s;&s;ed Effects of Mr. <HI>Hamilton's well-known Princi|ples.</HI></P>
<P>This &s;agacious Gentleman <HI>begs Leave to ob&s;erve, that Informations for Libels, is a Child, if not born, yet nurs'd up and brought to full Maturity in the Court of Star-Chamber:</HI> But what is particularly to be inferr'd from this &s;hrewd Ob&s;ervation, he does not at pre&s;ent tell us. If the Star-Chamber was the Court where Crimes of this Nature were generally puni&s;hed, ac|cording to its ordinary and proper Juri&s;diction, as it certainly was, how &s;hould it be otherwi&s;e than that Informations for Libels mu&s;t be met with there? And con&s;idering the Antiquity of that Court, 'tis more than probable the Crime was fir&s;t pro&s;ecuted and pu|ni&s;hed in it. But what then? Is the Legitimacy of the Child (if I may be allowed to carry on the Metaphor) therefore to be call'd in Que&s;tion? Or its Education the le&s;s honourable? I might put our witty Barri&s;ter in Mind, that what I have mentioned is the very Rea&s;on why the <HI>&s;purious Brat</HI> he is &s;o fond of, which was never brought to full Maturity, nor ever will, fir&s;t appeared in the Star-Chamber, tho' it has not been heard of &s;ince in any other Court till very lately at <HI>New-York,</HI> I mean that of making Fal&s;hood to be e&s;&s;ential to a Libel, and claiming a Right to give Evidence of the Truth of it by Way of Ju&s;tification.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="011573_0027_0F8746BC22063C50">He mu&s;t however intend by the foregoing Pa&s;&s;age to impeach the Legality of Informations <HI>qua</HI> &s;uch (which by &s;ome Words that drop from him many Pages after, would &s;eem to be what he aims at) or as they relate only to <HI>Libels;</HI> and in either Ca&s;e he will again betray the Scantine&s;s of his Reading and Know|ledge in the Law.

<P>If the Barri&s;ter means notwith&s;tanding to &s;ugge&s;t moreover, that Informations for Libels are but of mo|dern Date, or little longer Standing then about the Time of the Expiration of that Court, where he &s;uppo&s;es they had their Origin, let him be further refuted by the abovementioned Sir <HI>Thomas Mallet,</HI> who wrote profe&s;&s;edly on the Court of Star-Chamber, and may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be pretty well acquainted with his Sub|ject. He tells us, that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Treati&s;e of the Court of Star-Chamber, <HI>ubi &s;upra.</HI></NOTE> <Q>In all Ages Libels have been &s;everely puni&s;hed in this Court, but mo&s;t &s;pe|cially they began to grow frequent about 42 and 43 <HI>Eliz.</HI> when Sir <HI>Edward Coke</HI> was her Attorney General.</Q> And, treating of the Antiquity of that Court he makes it very probable, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Id. <HI>1</HI> Part, 4th Con&s;id.</NOTE> <HI>It was the mo&s;t ancient of any Court of Ju&s;tice, and the Mother Court of the Kingdom;</HI> wherein he does not differ from Sir <HI>Edward</HI> him&s;elf, in his 4th <HI>In&s;t.</HI> 64, already quoted. Now 'twas while this con&s;ummate Lawyer it &s;eems was Attorney General to the renowned Queen <HI>Eliza|beth,</HI> that Informations for Libels began to be mo&s;t frequent, or in Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s elegant Stile, when <HI>the Child was brought to full Maturity:</HI> And it is readily &s;ubmitted to all who are vers'd in our Hi&s;|tory and Con&s;titution, whether that Period will be any Di&s;paragement to the Offspring.</P>
<P>But if Informations for Libels in particular were one of the Grievances of that Court, nay the chief, as the Barri&s;ter would labour to make his Hearers believe,

He de&s;ires the Attorney-General <HI>to favour them with &s;ome Stan|dard Definition of a Libel, by which it may be cer|tainly known whether a Writing be a Libel, yea, or not.</HI> And what is this for? Why truly to <HI>&s;horten the Di&s;pute.</HI> But what Di&s;pute does he &s;peak of? The only Point that could admit of Di&s;pute had been given up before by his confe&s;&s;ing the Matters in I&s;&s;ue, and the Pro&s;ecutor's Witne&s;&s;es, being there|upon di&s;charg'd. As to what he requires, either there was &s;uch a Definition to be met with in the Books, or there was not; if there was, he ought to have known it; if there was not, why &s;hould he de&s;ire Mr. Attorney to <HI>favour</HI> him with one? Yet after he had been indulg'd beyond Mea&s;ure, and a Definition was produc'd from a good Author, who be&s;ides refers to &s;everal others that are unque&s;tiona|ble, all which conclude again&s;t his Client; is this loquatious Advocate contented? No. <HI>There are two Words to that Bargain,</HI> as he had &s;aid before.

own Defence in a de&s;perate Cau&s;e. But I an&s;wer, no Rules certainly can be of U&s;e to tho&s;e, who are de|termin'd to act without any, or in Oppo&s;ition to all Rules, in which Cla&s;s our Northern Barri&s;ter mu&s;t be plac'd, if we are to frame a Judgement of him from the Share he bore in this Tryal. The Rule laid down in our Books concerning <HI>Libels</HI> (I &s;peak of Li|bels in the &s;trict Sen&s;e) according to the Definition of Mr. Serjeant <HI>Hawkins</HI> referr'd to in the Tryal, and which alone concerns the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, is founded on the Rea&s;on of the Thing; and is the &s;ame which is to be ob&s;erved in other Matters that depend upon the Con&s;truction of Words and Writings, which are Signs only, or Images of Ideas intended to be conveyed to the Under&s;tandings of the Reader. There may in|deed, be divers Rules apply'd according to the Cir|cum&s;tances of the Ca&s;e, and this among the Re&s;t, that where Words are capable of two Sen&s;es, the one faulty, the other innocent; the latter is to be taken, provided &s;uch a Con&s;truction may be made without violence to their natural Import and Meaning. From whence it will follow, that the &s;ame Ca&s;es may hap|pen that are doubtful and do not come under any Standard Rule, on all which Occa&s;ions hone&s;t and upright Judges will incline to the favourable Side; there may be others again &s;o clear and evident, that a Man mu&s;t re&s;ign his Rea&s;on, or re&s;olve to &s;acrifice his Con&s;cience that does not di&s;cern, or will not allow them to be Libellous. But in none of the&s;e Ca&s;es can it come properly to be a Que&s;tion before the Jury whether a Libel or not on the Plea of not Guilty, tho' it might afterwards be &s;o, before the Court in Arre&s;t of Judgement. By what has been &s;aid, there appears to be Latitude enough for a &s;kilful Pen, (who not|with&s;tanding mu&s;t do it at his Peril) to la&s;h publick and private Vices, to caution the People again&s;t Mea|&s;ures that may be hurtful to them, or to remon&s;trate a|gain&s;t the evil Practices even of tho&s;e in Power, without being always expos'd to the Penalties of the Law.
