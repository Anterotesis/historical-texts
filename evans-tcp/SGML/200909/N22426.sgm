<L>Big cur&s;es by day, ay, and bigger by night,</L>
<L>On the Jenky-nurs'd Jackall that brought on this plight!</L>
<L>Who has <HI>&s;talk'd on Court &s;tills</HI> to that ruinous brink,</L>
<L>Where it's hopele&s;s to move&mdash;and more hopele&s;s to think.</L>

<L><HI>A while</HI> your brave <HI>tars,</HI> the great <HI>prop of your State,</HI></L>
<L>Have, by glory and conque&s;t, John, put <HI>off</HI> your fate;</L>
<L>But, if e'er on <HI>French decks,</HI> &s;houts of <HI>victory roar,</HI></L>
<L><HI>The Crown's a Red Night-cap&mdash;and Britain's no more!</HI></L>

<L>Troth, the <HI>Cur</HI> was well warn'd of War's <HI>de&s;perate</HI> &s;in,</L>
<L>Then, with head-long pre&s;umption, he <HI>hurry'd</HI> you in.</L>
<L>The voice of &s;ound wi&s;dom cry'd loud on the cur&s;e:</L>
<L>But wi&s;dom was <HI>wind,</HI> to the <HI>voice of the nur&s;e!</HI></L>
