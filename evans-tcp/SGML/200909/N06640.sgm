<HEAD>DISCOURSE I. OF the great Things which GOD hath done for us.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>PSALM CXXVI. Ver&s;e 3d.</HI></BIBL>
<P>THE LORD hath done great Things for us, whereof we are glad.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_NO comment is nece&s;&s;ary for the expla|nation of the&s;e words, which are very plain of them&s;elves: Neither is there need of any preface, or introduction, in order to accommodate them to the pre&s;ent joyful occa&s;ion; &s;ince, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, they mu&s;t appear, even at fir&s;t view, &s;ufficiently adapted to it. We may therefore imme|diately adopt them our&s;elves, and apply them to the bu&s;ine&s;s of this day. For the Lord hath, indeed, done great things for us, whereof we are doubtle&s;s glad; having abundant rea&s;on to be &s;o. And, in the lan|guage of the context, well may "our mouth be now filled with laughter, and our tongue with &s;inging."</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="008417_0005_102F298BAA258D00">IT is propo&s;ed, by divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in the fir&s;t place, to repre&s;ent to you tho&s;e great things which God hath lately done for us, for our land and nation; and which are the occa&s;ion of our being a&s;&s;embled together in his hou&s;e of prai&s;e at this time.</P>
<P>IN the next place will be &s;hown, the propriety of being glad and rejoicing on &s;uch occa&s;ions, and what great rea&s;on we have for it at pre&s;ent; more e&s;pecially on account of that important event, which is the more particular and immediate occa&s;ion of this &s;olem|nity.</P>
<P>SOME needful regulations of our joy on this occa|&s;ion, will then be &s;ubjoined; that it may be taught to flow in a proper channel, and be agreeable to our character as chri&s;tians, in&s;tead of degenerating into the mirth of fools.</P>
<P>AND the whole will be clo&s;ed with &s;uch reflections and exhortations, as the occa&s;ion it&s;elf naturally &s;ug|ge&s;ts; and which may, therefore, be particularly &s;ea|&s;onable at this time.</P>
<P>TO return then, it will be proper, in the fir&s;t place,</P>
<P N="1">I. TO repre&s;ent to you tho&s;e great things which God hath lately done for us, for our land and nation; and which are the occa&s;ion of our being now a&s;&s;embled together in his hou&s;e of prai&s;e. And altho' many of you may, perhaps, have a more accurate knowledge, a ju&s;ter conception, and a deeper &s;en&s;e, of the&s;e favors of heaven, than I have my&s;elf; yet it will be good for us to talk of them, to revolve them in our minds, and &s;peak of the great goodne&s;s of our God to us, with reference to them. If I do not inform you of any
<PB N="7" REF="008417_0006_102F2990A4BF9F90">
thing, which you knew not before; yet I may po&s;&s;ibly revive the remembrance of certain mercies, which had &s;lipped the memories of &s;ome; and contribute towards fixing both them, and others, in your minds; which, it is conceived, will be an&s;wering a valuable end. For the more thorough, or deeper &s;en&s;e, we have of the&s;e mercies, the more permanent it will be; and the more permanent it is, the more la&s;ting will be our gratitude to God for them; and the more la&s;ting our gratitude, the more &s;uitable returns &s;hall we make to him; which will be, in effect, be&s;t to an&s;wer the true ends of this &s;olemnity.</P>
<P>IT is propo&s;ed, as was intimated before, to enlarge chiefly on that great and happy event, which is the principal, and more immediate occa&s;ion, of our pub|lic rejoicing and thank&s;givings at this time. My di&s;|cour&s;e in the afternoon, will be in a manner confined to this event; which will al&s;o employ more of our time this morning, than any other particular one. However, it is humbly conceived, there will be no impropriety in taking a little larger compa&s;s, and ex|tending our views, on this occa&s;ion, even beyond A|merica. Accordingly, if you plea&s;e, we will introduce this intere&s;ting affair, the reduction or &s;urrender of the capital city of Canada, by taking a tran&s;ient view of &s;ome other of our late military &s;ucce&s;&s;es, which pre|ceeded it; looking back to the principal of tho&s;e, which have come to our knowledge &s;ince the time of our la&s;t general and public thank&s;giving; and connecting the&s;e later with former ones, which were taken notice of on that occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>AS you may remember, we then &s;aw the war in ge|neral going on pro&s;perou&s;ly on the &s;ide of Great-Britain and her allies. We then &s;aw the enemy driven, with great lo&s;s and &s;laughter, out of his Maje&s;ty's
<PB N="8" REF="008417_0007_102F2994B9F16790">
German dominions. We then al&s;o &s;aw &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s|ful de&s;cents made on the coa&s;ts of France, from whence we had been threatned, but ju&s;t before, with an inva|&s;ion, as at pre&s;ent. We then &s;aw &s;everal of the ene|my's fortre&s;&s;es, and one of her valuable &s;ettlements, on the coa&s;t of Africa, reduced; and &s;ubjected to the obedience of his Britannic Maje&s;ty. We then &s;aw his Maje&s;ty's illu&s;trious Pru&s;&s;ian Ally, not only &s;tanding his ground again&s;t his numerous enemies, but victori|ous in divers in&s;tances; and, in particular, triumphant over the formidable Ru&s;&s;ian army. We then &s;aw, here in America, the French fortre&s;s, u&s;ually called Frontinac, &s;urrended to his Maje&s;ty's arms; and our troops returning from thence laden with the &s;poils of our enemies. We then &s;aw the enemy driven from the river St. John; and the adjacent country &s;ecured to his Maje&s;ty; the whole Penin&s;ula of Nova-Scotia having been before reduced, and well garri&s;oned by our troops. We then &s;aw the Briti&s;h colours on the walls of Loui&s;bourg; and the i&s;lands of Cape-Breton and St. John, in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. We then &s;aw the trade of the enemy greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; and her mari|time power much le&s;&s;ened: We &s;aw the ports of Great-Britain and her colonies, filled with the merchant|men of France, and her private &s;hips of war; while the ports of the enemy were mo&s;tly blocked up. We then &s;aw the armed ve&s;&s;els of France on lake On|tario, burnt; and no incon&s;iderable part of her royal navy, taken, &s;unk, or otherwi&s;e de&s;troyed. In fine, we then &s;aw the commerce of the enemy, to appear|ance, almo&s;t ruined; her councils di&s;concerted, and her coffers low: the councils of Great-Britain firm and &s;teady; her trade in a flouri&s;hing condition; and her fleets triumphant on every &s;ea, where the Briti&s;h flag made its appearance.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="008417_0008_102F2996565043D8">IT was judged not ami&s;s ju&s;t to hint at the&s;e former &s;ucce&s;&s;es, with which heaven had favoured the Briti&s;h arms, before we came to tho&s;e later ones, which fall within the period mentioned above; and which are now to be &s;poken of. Only it is to be ob&s;erved, that as this di&s;cour&s;e is not de&s;igned for an hi&s;tory, much le&s;s for a journal, of &s;ieges, voyages, and campaigns; &s;o it mu&s;t not be expected, that I &s;hould be minutely circum&s;tantial; but only &s;peak of the great things which God has done for us, in a &s;ummary, general way; which, it is conceived, is the only one that is proper for this place and occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>AS things looked with a favourable and promi&s;ing a&s;pect, where we left off above; &s;o it mu&s;t be acknow|ledged with all gratitude, that God has not di&s;appoin|ted the hopes, which tho&s;e &s;miles of his providence had rai&s;ed in us. The war has gone on with great and remarkable &s;ucce&s;s, on the part of Great Britain, ever &s;ince, as well as for &s;ome time before, our la&s;t general thank&s;giving; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">November 23. 1758.</NOTE> which is now almo&s;t a year. God has done many con&s;iderable, and &s;ome great things for us, in this time; while our lo&s;&s;es and di&s;advan|tages have, comparatively &s;peaking, been few and &s;mall.</P>
<P>SINCE the period la&s;t referred to, we have had au|thentic advices from the Ea&s;t-Indies, of an advantage gained there over the enemy's fleet in an engage|ment, the con&s;equence of which was the utter lo&s;s of &s;everal of their capital &s;hips. And altho', about the &s;ame time, the enemy obtained an advantage by land, in tho&s;e parts; yet there is great rea&s;on to hope, that by means of the &s;uccours &s;oon after received there, whatever lo&s;s we &s;u&s;tained is at lea&s;t retrieved, if not more than retrieved; whereas that of the enemy could not be &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="008417_0009_102F2997E32BA1B0">BUT leaving tho&s;e di&s;tant parts, the &s;ituation of our affairs in which, we have le&s;s certainty of, let us come to Europe; and take a cur&s;ory view of it there.</P>
<P>AT the opening of the pre&s;ent &s;ea&s;on for the de|&s;tructive bu&s;ine&s;s of war, the French King thought proper to &s;end a prodigious army into Germany. This, in conjunction with other troops in tho&s;e parts, was de&s;tin'd to ravage his Maje&s;ty's Hanoverian domini|ons; and, in &s;hort, to conquer, and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof, for his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty: Who, if he re&s;emble his immediate Predece&s;&s;or, of &s;uch famous memory for di&s;turbing and plundering his neighbours, can no more be &s;atisfied, either with conquered, or &s;to|len provinces and countries, than <Q>he that loveth &s;ilver can be &s;atisfied with &s;ilver, or he that loveth abundance, with increa&s;e.</Q> Who&s;e <HI>Greatne&s;s,</HI> in its nature and ri&s;e, was not very different from that of the <HI>great</HI> Chaldean Monarch, thus characterized in &s;a|cred writ: <Q>He is a proud man, neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his de&s;ire as hell, and is as death, and cannot be &s;atisfied; but gathereth unto him all nations, and heaping unto him all people. &mdash; Wo to him that increa&s;eth that which is not his! How long? &mdash; Becau&s;e thou ha&s;t &s;poiled many na|tions, all the remnant of the people &s;hall &s;poil thee; becau&s;e of men's blood, and for the violence of the land &mdash;</Q> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Habak. II. 5, &mdash; 8.</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT not to digre&s;s: This de&s;ign of his Mo&s;t Chri|&s;tian Maje&s;ty upon Hanover, had almo&s;t &s;ucceeded, and taken effect; &s;o that all the friends to the liberties of Europe, who are of cour&s;e enemies to the ambitious views of France, &s;tood agha&s;t, as it were; and trem|bled for the con&s;equence of a general battle, which was now unavoidable; the army on which, under God,
<PB N="11" REF="008417_0010_102F29998563BED8">
the &s;alvation of that country depended, being inferior in number, at lea&s;t by one half, to the united forces of that, which &s;tood ready to devour her to the very heart, having before &s;carce half gorged it&s;elf with her exterior, and le&s;s e&s;&s;ential parts. In this critical and memorable juncture, it plea&s;ed God to in&s;pire Prince Ferdinand with &s;uch wi&s;dom and magnanimity, and his comparatively &s;mall army of Briti&s;h and Hanove|rian troops, with &s;uch invincible bravery and ardor, as not only to maintain their ground, but to gain a compleat victory. This prodigious army they entire|ly routed, not without great &s;laughter; took their ar|tillery, magazines, &amp;c. pur&s;ued them to the We&s;er, and into it; where thou&s;ands of them peri&s;hed in the waters, as the proud Pharaoh and his ho&s;t peri&s;hed in the Red Sea. And altho' there were nothing preter-natural in this ca&s;e, as in the other; yet it &s;eems, up|on the whole, to have been a remarkable interpo&s;ition of providence: So that Prince Ferdinand, who is as much renowned for his piety, as for his great military virtues, might on this occa&s;ion have adopted, with great propriety, the &s;ong of Mo&s;es, on that alluded to above,&mdash;"I will &s;ing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriou&s;ly; the hor&s;e and his rider hath he thrown into the &s;ea.&mdash;Pharaoh's chariots and his ho&s;t &mdash;his cho&s;en captains al&s;o, are drowned in the Red Sea. The depths have covered them; they &s;ank into the bottom as a &s;tone. Thy right hand, O Lord, is become glorious in power; thy right hand, O Lord, hath da&s;hed in pieces the enemy." There is another &s;acred &s;ong, which all his Maje&s;ty's Hanoverian &s;ub|jects might, with peculiar propriety adopt, on occa&s;ion of this memorable deliverance from impending ruin. &mdash;"If it had not been the Lord who was on our &s;ide, now may <HI>Hanover</HI> &s;ay; if it had not been the Lord who was on our &s;ide, when men ro&s;e up again&s;t us;
<PB N="12" REF="008417_0011_102F299C8D220F80">
then they had &s;wallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled again&s;t us. Then the waters had overwhelmed us&mdash;the proud waters had gone over our &s;oul. Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, who hath not given us a prey to their teeth. Our &s;oul is e&s;caped as a bird out of the &s;nare of the fowlers; the &s;nare is broken, and we are e&s;caped. Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth"</P>
<P>BUT to proceed to &s;ome other matters, which more immediately concern Great Britain and her dependencies, though not our gracious Sovereign; who&s;e hereditary German dominions may naturally and ju&s;tly claim a great &s;hare in his royal care and affections: The French have been meditating, or at lea&s;t pretending to meditate, a de&s;cent upon the i&s;land of Britain, with a formidable army; and again to bring the Pretender on the &s;tage. Yea, their pre|&s;umption has talk'd, and vaunted it&s;elf of a conque&s;t of tho&s;e kingdoms; &s;o that they &s;eem, in their own vain imagination, to have anticipated &s;o great a tri|umph. And if they have not been in earne&s;t, at lea&s;t their preparations for an inva&s;ion, have been &s;o va&s;t and expen&s;ive, as might naturally make one believe, they were: For it is hardly to be &s;uppo&s;ed, they would be at &s;uch a prodigious expence of labour and money, without any de&s;ign to put their threats in execution; and &s;o, in the event, to make them&s;elves the je&s;t of Europe, which they have &s;ometimes done at a much cheaper rate; and might doubtle&s;s have done &s;o a|gain. But whatever their real intentions might have been by the&s;e formidable preparations, Great-Britain, on her part, has been attentive to guard again&s;t the wor&s;t. Proper di&s;po&s;itions have been made on her own coa&s;ts for the reception of the enemy; and at the &s;ame time, the ports of France near the Bri|ti&s;h
<PB N="13" REF="008417_0012_102F299F26451E80">
channel, have been &s;o well watch'd and guarded by our &s;uperior fleets, that the enemy, altho' they had had a &s;ufficient force, and al! things in readine&s;s to make a de&s;cent, have not yet had it in their power to leave their own coa&s;ts, without almo&s;t the certain lo&s;s of their whole army and armament, with a great part of their navy. Yea, divine providence has &s;o favour'd us, that one of the Briti&s;h admirals has had it in his power to enter one of the enemy's ports, where the&s;e grand preparations were making; and to de&s;troy a part thereof, with &s;ome of their &s;tores and magazines, &s;ome of their &s;hipping, and even a con&s;iderable part of the city it&s;elf, near which they were. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Havre de Grace.</NOTE></P>
<P>ANOTHER of our admirals, or at lea&s;t part of his &s;quadron, not long after, approached &s;o near their principal port, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bre&s;t.</NOTE> where their chief maritime &s;trength was collected, as to bring off &s;ome of the &s;hips carry|ing &s;upplies to them, even from under the fruitle&s;s fire of their ca&s;tles and batteries.</P>
<P>BUT we have very lately had authentic advices of &s;till greater importance, re&s;pecting the good &s;ucce&s;s of a third Briti&s;h admiral, the &s;ame who commanded the fleet the la&s;t Year at the &s;iege of Loui&s;bourg, &s;till fre&s;h in all our memories. For when one of the enemy's &s;quadrons was about joining their principal fleet, and in a fair way of effecting it, which might have proved of bad con&s;equence to us, this brave and &s;ucce&s;sful admiral, you know, opportunely di&s;covered, at|tacked, and beat it; taking and de&s;troying five or &s;ix capital &s;hips; the remainder, or at lea&s;t the mo&s;t of them, being obliged to betake them&s;elves to a neutral port; and there reduced, in their extremi|ty, to implore convoy of a neutral power, to &s;ee them &s;afe back again into their own, <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Toulon.</NOTE> from whence their evil genius had tempted them to depart. But
<PB N="14" REF="008417_0013_102F29A29FA3D2B0">
in vain; being &s;till blocked up by a &s;uperior force; &s;o that we need not wholly de&s;pair of having further ac|counts of them, which may be agreeable to us.</P>
<P>I MUST not omit, now I am hinting at &s;ome very intere&s;ting occurrencies in Europe, relative to the war, to mention the la&s;t advices, which we hope may be depended on, re&s;pecting the victory of his Maje&s;ty's great Pru&s;&s;ian ally over the Ru&s;&s;ian army, then with|in a few leagues of his own capital, which &s;eemed in imminent danger of falling into the hands of tho&s;e Barbarians. If this advice be not premature, as we all hope it is not, this is a very important event, not only to his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty, who has now &s;tood as it were on the brink of a mighty precipice, for &s;everal years together; but al&s;o to our King, and to Great-Britain, who&s;e intere&s;ts are at pre&s;ent &s;o clo&s;ely con|nected with tho&s;e of that truly great and illu&s;trious Monarch. May angels &s;till guard him! or rather He, who "maketh his angels &s;pirits, and his mini&s;ters a flame of fire:" who giveth &s;alvation unto kings; and has hitherto delivered FREDERIC his &s;ervant from the hurtful &s;word!</P>
<P>BUT if you plea&s;e, we will now come from Europe to America; which is coming &s;till nearer to our&s;elves. But before I &s;ay any thing of the military operations on the continent, we will ca&s;t an eye towards the American i&s;lands. For it is there we are to look for, and there that we may find, one of the great things which God has lately done for us. The reduction of Guadaloupe, with &s;ome of the adjacent i&s;lands, is truly &s;uch; and, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e the greater, becau&s;e effected by &s;o &s;mall a force, and under &s;uch &s;eemingly di&s;ad|vantageous circum&s;tances. This is almo&s;t, and per|haps may prove quite, an irretrievable and irreparable
<PB N="15" REF="008417_0014_102F29A5E8140E38">
lo&s;s, to that haughty, and all-gra&s;ping power which has incurred it; a lo&s;s which &s;he will much longer feel and mourn, than we did that of the i&s;land of Minor|ca, at the beginning of the pre&s;ent war, during a le&s;s watchful mini&s;try than the pre&s;ent. And to Great-Britain, this acqui&s;ition alone, if maintained, will pro|bably much more than make good all the damage &s;he &s;u&s;tained in the former re&s;pect; which, if I mi&s;take not, time and experience make &s;till le&s;s and le&s;s con|&s;iderable.</P>
<P>BUT while our thoughts are in that part of the world, where &s;o valuable and noble an acqui&s;ition has been made, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God on the Briti&s;h arms; while our thoughts are engaged in that part of the world, I &s;ay, and on &s;o worthy and joyful an oc|ca&s;ion; what is it that &s;till gives a kind of damp to my &s;pirits; or rather, rai&s;es my indignation? While a Briti&s;h fleet rides &s;afely and quietly in port, do I &s;ee an inferior French one &s;ailing, in a kind of triumph, from port to port, from i&s;land to i&s;land, from one month to another? Do I &s;ee our merchantmen, by &s;cores, or hundreds, taken within hearing of the Briti&s;h cannon, if they were but di&s;charged? Do I &s;ee them carried into port, in va&s;t numbers, even by the ene|my's privateers, from within a few leagues of our fleet, which looks patiently on? Do I hear our enemies &s;aying, with &s;corn and in&s;ult, <Q>Where is the boa&s;ted courage of the&s;e Britons, who vainly pretend to be lords of the ocean?</Q> And do I hear even &s;ome of our friends whi&s;pering, <Q>that all Briti&s;h comman|ders have not the &s;pirit which becomes their charac|ter?</Q>&mdash;But perhaps all this is but a reverie: If &s;o, I will trouble you no longer with my dreams: But even dreams are not always fal&s;e; and if there &s;hould happen to be any thing of reality in this, &s;uch things

will doubtle&s;s be taken proper notice of by tho&s;e, who want neither the authority, nor the public &s;pirit to do it.</P>
<P>AND having thus taken a &s;hort trip, if I may &s;o ex|pre&s;s it, to the American i&s;lands; and &s;een there, an important acqui&s;ition lately made by his Maje&s;ty's troops, under the favour of divine providence; let us now cro&s;s over to the continent, in the affairs of which we our&s;elves are mo&s;t immediately concerned. And being arrived here, we will not now needle&s;ly ramble about, backwards and forwards. But &s;etting out from the &s;outhermo&s;t &s;cene of action, (I mean, where any thing of great importance has lately been done) which is indeed neare&s;t the parts from whence we la&s;t came, and proceeding thence to the northward, tho' the di&s;|tance is great, thro' a wilderne&s;s, and tho' there are &s;everal noble pro&s;pects in the way to detain and de|light us, even in a wilderne&s;s; yet it will not be long before we arrive at the capital city of Canada. There our chief bu&s;ine&s;s lies: There it will, therefore, be at lea&s;t proper, if not nece&s;&s;ary, to make a longer &s;tay. And tho' it be a cold climate, I flatter my&s;elf, we &s;hall find &s;omething to warm and enliven us; or at lea&s;t to keep our blood from chilling.</P>
<P>TO begin at the &s;outhward then: It was not long after our la&s;t general thank&s;giving, when we had the little expected, and therefore the more joyful tydings, that the Briti&s;h troops, even without the trouble of a &s;iege, were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the French fortre&s;s on the forks of the Ohio, u&s;ually called fort du Que&s;ne; but now Pitt&s;burgh, in honor to that great patriot, that wi&s;e, hone&s;t, and magnanimous Briti&s;h mini&s;ter, dur|ing who&s;e mini&s;try, not only this, but all our other &s;ucce&s;&s;es, worth mentioning, &s;ince the pre&s;ent war commenced, have been obtained. This fortre&s;s, it
<PB N="17" REF="008417_0016_102F29AAECC019B8">
&s;eems, was evacuated by the enemy on the near ap|proach of our army. The acqui&s;ition whereof is of great importance to our &s;outhern colonies; not only with reference to the &s;avages in tho&s;e parts, who are &s;ince, from enemies become friends; but al&s;o in re&s;|pect of that mo&s;t valuable and very exten&s;ive country about it; which, in due time, may probably be peo|pled with Briti&s;h &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>AND there are one or two circum&s;tances be&s;ides, which may ju&s;t be mentioned with relation hereto; and which may, perhaps, heighten the joy of &s;ome on account of this acqui&s;ition. One is, that the pre|&s;ent war with France, had its ri&s;e more immediately from &s;ome differences re&s;pecting this country on the Ohio; here ho&s;tilities began; here it was, that the French had the a&s;&s;urance to &s;eize, captivate, and mur|der, our traders and others, in a time of peace; as al|&s;o to fortify on this river. But we have now the &s;atisfaction to reflect, that the law of arms at lea&s;t, has decided in our favour one con&s;iderable point contro|verted between the two crowns; and which was in|deed a principal ground of the pre&s;ent war, tho' by no means the only one.</P>
<P>ANOTHER circum&s;tance alluded to above, is, that we had received &s;everal repul&s;es and defeats from the enemy, in endeavouring to regain the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country we are &s;peaking of; from whence the enemy had, in a time of peace, driven the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain. The expence of one of the former expeditions again&s;t Du Que&s;ne had been very great, through almo&s;t impracticable woods and mountains: And at la&s;t, when the Briti&s;h army had in a manner &s;urmounted the&s;e difficulties, and thought them&s;elves almo&s;t &s;ure of &s;ucce&s;s, it was in a &s;ort &s;urpri&s;ed, and
<PB N="18" REF="008417_0017_102F29AF0474E650">
put to the rout, by a lurking enemy which it hardly &s;aw; as even the noble and generous Lion, in pa&s;&s;ing thro' a thicket, may be &s;tung and poi&s;on'd to death by a vile in&s;idious &s;erpent undi&s;covered, which one of his paws, or only the flapping of his tail, might have de&s;troyed in an in&s;tant. Thus it was, that a brave Engli&s;h general <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">General Braddock.</NOTE> here received his mortal wound from a foe, contemptible every where but in his own native woods and &s;wamps; a general, who&s;e valor, zeal, and indefatigable indu&s;try in the &s;ervice of his king and country, cannot be too much commended; and who&s;e untimely fall can hardly be too much la|mented.</P>
<P>I MUST confe&s;s, tho' to &s;ome it may perhaps &s;eem a weakne&s;s, that the&s;e circum&s;tances preceeding this acqui&s;ition, give an heightening to my own joy on account of it; tho' it be in it&s;elf &s;o important in many re&s;pects, that it could not, even without the&s;e, fail to rejoice every well-wi&s;her to his Maje&s;ty's American colonies.</P>
<P>BUT having &s;topped long enough here, con&s;idering the time allowed us for our journey; let us now ha&s;ten to the northward, as was propo&s;ed. A very material acqui&s;ition has been made this pre&s;ent cam|paign, of the fortre&s;s of Niagara. This was in it&s;elf a &s;trong fort, and defended by a numerous garri&s;on: Which is not to be wondered at, con&s;idering the im|portance of it to the enemy. For being &s;ituated be|tween the two Lakes, Erie and Ontario, it commanded the communication between Canada and Loui&s;iana, the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ipi, &amp;c. And be&s;ides, it was &s;o &s;ituated as to draw the commerce, and with it the affections, of numerous tribes of &s;avages about tho&s;e lakes; as
<PB N="19" REF="008417_0018_102F29B304C5DCE0">
al&s;o to awe the &s;ix nations, our old friends and allies; and even to &s;tagger their friend&s;hip; which, as might naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed, u&s;ually follows their inte|re&s;t, wherever it leads. This important fortre&s;s is now in our hands; the very con&s;iderable army that had been de&s;tin'd to its relief, and to rai&s;e the &s;iege, being repul&s;ed with great &s;laughter, and the garri&s;on made pri&s;oners of war. By which acqui&s;ition, the wavering nations of the Mohawks, as they are com|monly called, are &s;ecured in their fidelity and friend|&s;hip; many other tribes of the &s;avages have become our u&s;eful allies, in&s;tead of perfidious enemies; the French forts and &s;ettlements at Pre&s;que I&s;le and Ve|nango are abandoned; and, in &s;hort, the whole ex|tent of country between Lake Ontario and Pitt&s;burgh, is left without a per&s;on who dares to own him&s;elf our enemy, unle&s;s we look far to the we&s;tward. It may be added, that by this acqui&s;ition, if maintained, even tho' Canada had remained intire in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the enemy, would have been effectually cut off, all intercour&s;e of any con&s;equence between Canada, De|troit, and all the French forts and &s;ettlements to the &s;outhward of Lake Erie. So that the enemy on that &s;ide, could have maintained their ground only on the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ipi, and &s;ome of its remote branches; where, by rea&s;on of the di&s;tance from us, and the difficulty of the navigation, they could neither give us much di&s;|turbance, nor gain much advantage to them&s;elves. And this acqui&s;ition, &s;o important in its nature, it is to be remembered, was made with the lo&s;s of a very &s;mall number of our troops; tho' not without the lo&s;s of a brave and excellent general; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brigadier-General Prideaux.</NOTE> not indeed, killed by the enemy; but in vulgar phra&s;e, by an ac|cident; yet &s;uch an accident as is directed by the providence of God. For if a &s;parrow does not fall to
<PB N="20" REF="008417_0019_102F29B56B0D8BA0">
the ground without our Father, much le&s;s &s;uch a worthy commander; of more value, not only than many &s;parrows, but than many general officers of an higher rank.</P>
<P>FROM the la&s;t mentioned fortre&s;s to the capital whither we are bound, the neare&s;t and directe&s;t cour&s;e is acro&s;s Ontario to Frontinac, and &s;o down the river Cataraqui to La Galette, &amp;c. However, as we have not heard of any thing lately done there, to invite us that way, we will take another route; which tho' longer, will be much more agreeable to us.</P>
<P>LET us therefore proceed from Niagara to Lake George; a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, and mo&s;tly through a wilderne&s;s; but where we may now travel with &s;afety, tho' unarmed; there being no enemy here to do us any harm. We &s;ee the country all our own, to the latter of the&s;e lakes: At the &s;outhern part of which, a year or two &s;ince, the enemy under general Mont|calm, made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of one of our forts; and, after the capitulation, and &s;urrender thereof, in|humanly &s;tripped, butchered and &s;calped the troops, to whom they had &s;olemnly plighted their faith. At which time the city of Albany it&s;elf trembled for fear; and &s;ome there were, who hardly thought them&s;elves &s;ecure, even in this metropolis. How different, how much more plea&s;ing a &s;cene, is now pre&s;ented to our view, if we ca&s;t our eyes on that quarter? e&s;pecially if we extend our view to the northern part of the la&s;t mentioned lake?</P>
<P>WE there &s;ee the main body of the enemy who, it &s;eems, the la&s;t year were &s;o powerful at Ticon|deroga, as to repul&s;e and rout a large army of 15 or 16,000 men, not without con&s;iderable &s;laugh|ter;
<PB N="21" REF="008417_0020_102F29B70E878350">
I &s;ay we there &s;ee the main body of the enemy, now retiring precipitately before the conqueror of Loui&s;bourg; even without daring to wait the near approach of his army. Doubtle&s;s the name of Am|her&s;t, tho' with a le&s;s numerous army than that which the enemy had &s;o lately defeated at the &s;ame place, taught them a &s;udden fear, and &s;ea&s;onably &s;ugge&s;ted to them, that their only &s;afety was in flight. This almo&s;t impregnable fortre&s;s is now in our hands, and all the country round Lake George; &s;o that between that and us, no enemy pre&s;umes to &s;et his foot. The value of this acqui&s;ition, &s;o important in it&s;elf, is in &s;ome mea&s;ure inhanced by reflecting on the expen|&s;ive, tho' fruitle&s;s attempts, heretofore made to ob|tain it; by reflecting on the lo&s;s of &s;o many brave men at that place; and above all, by reflecting on the untimely fall of one of our general officers there, the la&s;t year. The memory of Lord Howe will long be re&s;pected and honoured by every Briti&s;h &s;ub|ject, who has any e&s;teem for valor, military &s;kill, publick &s;pirit, activity, and unwearied application. His untimely fall, as it were in the fir&s;t bloom of manly age, would even now demand a tear, were not this a day of rejoicing.</P>
<P>BUT let us follow our wi&s;e and excellent general at the we&s;tward, from Lake George to Lake Cham|plain. We there al&s;o &s;ee the enemy flying before him; and leaving him to take a quiet, and uninter|rupted po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of fort Frederic, u&s;ually called Crown Point. A fortre&s;s which, tho' not very &s;trong in it&s;elf, has long been a grievous eye-&s;ore to tho&s;e nor|thern Briti&s;h colonies, and to our allies of the &s;ix nations, and that very ju&s;tly; &s;ince, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> enabled the enemy at any time &s;uddenly to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> frontier &s;ettlements, and afforded the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">

quick and &s;afe retreat; and where they could always &s;upply their good brethren, our &s;avage enemies, with provi&s;ions, cloathing, and warlike &s;tores. This for|tre&s;s we now &s;ee in our hands; or rather, a far better and &s;tronger one, lately built there under the direction of general Amher&s;t. In &s;hort, we &s;ee the whole coun|try thereabouts in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and &s;ecured to us; a communication opened between this lake and our we&s;tern frontiers; and &s;ettlers invited to come, and take up their habitation where, till very lately, it was not &s;afe for us to &s;et our feet. This we owe to general Amher&s;t, under providence: Who, according to our late&s;t advices, was proceeded &s;till farther northward; where we cannot at pre&s;ent follow him; but may &s;afe|ly rely on his prudence and magnanimity, under that divine direction which has thus far attended him; and humbly hope, he will take no &s;tep but what wi&s;dom &s;hall dictate, and providence &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>SOME may po&s;&s;ibly think it &s;trange, that the la&s;t mentioned general has made no quicker advances after a flying enemy; but given them time to fortify them&s;elves towards the northern end of the lake. But it may be taken for granted, that he is a tho|rough ma&s;ter of his profe&s;&s;ion; that he wants not zeal in his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice; and that he has &s;ufficient rea|&s;ons for this part of his conduct. Can any of us pre&s;ume to &s;ay, it was even practicable for him to make more ha&s;te, without being in hazard of mak|ing the wor&s;e &s;peed? Or do we know that this de|lay was not cho&s;en and preferred, upon the &s;ounde&s;t maxims of wi&s;dom and good policy? I am very far from pre&s;uming to be a judge of the&s;e matters; and much farther from pretending to penetrate the parti|cular views and de&s;igns of &s;o &s;ecret and con&s;ummate a commander. But might not this delay, &s;uppo&s;ing
<PB N="23" REF="008417_0022_102F29BB39C3DF50">
it not unavoidable, po&s;&s;ibly have been cho&s;en on the following account,&mdash; That had the general pre&s;&s;ed the enemy in their retreat before him, he would, in a &s;ort, have compelled them to go to the capital city, to add great numbers and &s;trength to the great army already there; and hereby, perhaps, have given an opportunity, and enabled them, to defeat and overthrow the little Briti&s;h army be&s;ieging it; before it would have been po&s;&s;ible for him to join it, which would have fru&s;trated the grand de&s;ign. For it would, on account of the nar|rows, or land-carriage in the way, have been &s;eem|ingly impo&s;&s;ible for this we&s;tern army to get to the capital, till &s;ome weeks after the flying enemy. But all this is only conjecture.</P>
<P>AND I am now, almo&s;t before I was aware of it, tho' perhaps after too long a delay, got to the chief &s;cene of action; where our mo&s;t &s;ignal &s;ucce&s;s has been; and where you will allow me to tarry a little longer than at either of the former places. I am even &s;till almo&s;t "as one that dreameth," when I think of the &s;urrender of the capital of Canada, which is in effect the reduction of the whole country. For it is morally, if not naturally impo&s;&s;ible, that the enemy, having lo&s;t this city, which is now in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;hould hold out half another campaign, again&s;t a force much inferior to that, which his Maje&s;ty has already in North-America. Yea, it is almo&s;t certain, that after taking the capital, laying wa&s;te the country, burning &s;o many of the hou&s;es, taking or de&s;troying &s;o great a part of the &s;tock, &s;tores and magazines; it is almo&s;t certain, I &s;ay, after this, that a great part of the enemy, who pretend &s;till to &s;tand out, mu&s;t either come in, and &s;ubmit to the generous terms of|fered them, or el&s;e, before another &s;pring, peri&s;h by hunger and cold, with their unhappy wives and
<PB N="24" REF="008417_0023_102F29BDCA8C7C38">
children; which God forbid! But not to anticipate tho&s;e ob&s;ervations and reflections, for which we &s;hall find a fitter place hereafter; let us now take a nearer, and more attentive view of this truly great and me|morable thing, which God has &s;o lately done for us, in delivering the capital city of Canada into our hands; with &s;ome of the mo&s;t material circum&s;tances rela|tive thereto.</P>
<P>GOD has remarkably &s;mil'd upon this great enter|prize from the very fir&s;t, till we &s;ee it brought to this happy conclu&s;ion: From the very fir&s;t, I &s;ay; unle&s;s we &s;hould make an exception as to the enemy's get|ting up the river with a con&s;iderable fleet of provi&s;ion and &s;tore &s;hips, under convoy, while a &s;quadron of Bri|ti&s;h men of war, de&s;tin'd to prevent any &s;uch relief and &s;ucours getting in, lay in port; &s;ome &s;ay, from nece&s;&s;i|ty. But however that might be, it is not improbable, that if this fleet had actually been intercepted, the re|duction of Quebec might have been effected much ea&s;ier and &s;ooner than it was; and the whole country, before this time, brought to a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. But not to dwell upon any circum&s;tance which was le&s;s in our favour than we could have wi&s;hed; let us proceed to &s;ome others, which were more &s;o than we could have rea&s;onably expected.</P>
<P>THE navigation of St. Lawrence's river has always, ever &s;ince Sir Hovenden Walker's fruitle&s;s attempt, wherein &s;everal &s;hips were lo&s;t, been repre&s;ented to us by friends and enemies, as being extreamly difficult and hazardous. However, thro' the favour of Him, whom winds and &s;eas obey, our very great fleet of men of war, of provi&s;ion, tran&s;port and &s;tore-&s;hips, arrived &s;afe at Orleans, a little below Quebec, meet|ing with little or no di&s;a&s;ter in the whole voyage. This
<PB N="25" REF="008417_0024_102F29C11CF5DD38">
is very remarkable; a thing almo&s;t unexampled in &s;o long a voyage, and with &s;o large a fleet, even where the navigation is, on all hands, allowed to be far le&s;s difficult and dangerous, than that of this river.</P>
<P>IT was another favourable circum&s;tance, that in the very heart of the enemy's country, our little army &s;hould land, with all their provi&s;ions, artillery and &s;tores, and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ground, almo&s;t with|out the lo&s;s of a man; e&s;pecially con&s;idering the lurking, in&s;idious and guileful genius of the enemies they had to deal with, and who were perfectly acquainted with all the country, &s;o that it might have been expected they would have made &s;ome con&s;iderable advantages hereof.</P>
<P>A THIRD circum&s;tance not unworthy of notice here, is, that after our fleet then at anchor, had been put into &s;ome di&s;order by a &s;torm, and, if my memo|ry does not fail me, before the &s;torm was quite over, the enemy attentive to every incident in their favour, cho&s;e this opportunity to &s;end down with a rapid tide, and full gale, a number of large fire&s;hips, and rafts on fire; hoping, not without &s;ome probability, by this means to de&s;troy a con&s;iderable part of the Briti&s;h fleet. But under the favour of providence, by the wi&s;e precaution of the Briti&s;h admiral, and the addre&s;s, the &s;ingular alertne&s;s and dexterity of the Briti&s;h &s;ea|men, this threatning mi&s;chief was intirely warded off; and &s;oon became only the &s;ubject of their merriment.</P>
<P>IT is further to be thankfully acknowledged, that our great fleet, and little army, have all along been favour'd with remarkable health; but a very &s;mall proportion of them having died by &s;ickne&s;s, or even been &s;ick at all. Whereas had &s;ickne&s;s prevailed a|mong our troops, even in a degree not uncommon in
<PB N="26" REF="008417_0025_102F29C3708EE0B0">
camps, it would have reduced that &s;mall army to &s;uch an handful of men, as mu&s;t in all probability have occa&s;ioned the breaking up of the &s;iege.</P>
<P>AND here I cannot but mention another thing, which, tho' it may &s;eem at fir&s;t view quite remote from the point in hand, has yet a clo&s;e connection with it. There was probably never known among us &s;o fruitful a &s;ea&s;on as that la&s;t pa&s;t. God has cau&s;ed the earth to yield her increa&s;e in very great abun|dance; whereby our fleet and army have had a con|&s;tant &s;upply of fre&s;h provi&s;ions, vegetables, &amp;c. To which it is in part doubtle&s;s owing, thro' the ble&s;&s;ing of God, that our fleet and army have enjoyed &s;o much health.</P>
<P>BUT to proceed to &s;ome other things. Our par|ties that were &s;ent out from time to time to harra&s;s the enemy, and lay wa&s;te the country, after the terms offered by the general were rejected, had &s;o much &s;uc|ce&s;s therein; and the city it&s;elf had been &s;o far ruin|ed by a long, con&s;tant and &s;evere bombardment, that neither of them could, in many years, have retrieved the&s;e damages and lo&s;&s;es, even tho' the &s;iege had been rai&s;ed before the actual reduction of the city.</P>
<P>I HAVE more than once called this a &s;iege; tho' by the way, what was done hardly amounted to &s;o much as is u&s;ually under&s;tood by a blockade. But call it what you plea&s;e, it is a wonder that it was not broken up, without effecting the main point: The enemy having encamped, and &s;trongly entrenched them&s;elves, in thrice the number of our &s;mall army; and in &s;o advantageous a place, that it would proba|bly have required even thrice their own great num|bers to force their lines. And after one un&s;ucce&s;sful
<PB N="27" REF="008417_0026_102F29C6F048CB48">
attempt to this end; when &s;o much of the &s;ea&s;on was gone; the &s;eeming impracticability of approaching the enemy where they were, and the improbability that they would ever give up this advantage, or be brought to hazard a general battle on equal ground, notwith&s;tanding their &s;uperior numbers; after all this, I &s;ay, 'tis probable there are but few generals, who would not have utterly de&s;pair'd of &s;ucceeding, given up the point, and left the enemy to retrieve, as well as they could, the great damages they had already &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>BUT it &s;eems the Briti&s;h general was one of tho&s;e rare military geniu&s;es, which, like the Phoenix, appear but once an age, except perhaps in Great-Britain. He was one of tho&s;e, who&s;e courage nothing could abate; who&s;e ardor, regulated by prudence, nothing could damp; who&s;e re&s;olution no difficulties, however great, could &s;hake or alter, &s;o long as a po&s;&s;ibility remained of carrying his de&s;ign into execution; and in fine, one of tho&s;e, who&s;e wi&s;dom and addre&s;s at a critical juncture, were not inferior to his other great military accompli&s;hments. The&s;e great qualities, with which heaven had endow'd him, and to which heaven &s;eldom fails of giving &s;ucce&s;s, were now all called forth, and di&s;played at once, in drawing the numerous enemy from their inacce&s;&s;ible entrenchments, to a general bat|tle, which he had long de&s;ired.</P>
<P>BEHOLD him there, with his little body of Briti&s;h troops, him&s;elf the head to direct, and the &s;oul to ani|mate the whole, if &s;uch troops needed animation; the force of Canada moving towards him with &s;low and &s;olemn &s;teps, under a try'd, experienced and ap|prov'd commander!&mdash;Unhappy <HI>Montcalm!</HI> courage|ous at lea&s;t, if not prudent at this time! What is it
<PB N="28" REF="008417_0027_102F29CA44D526F0">
that, in an unpropitious hour, tempts thee thus to forego tho&s;e advantages, which could not, perhaps, have been forced from thee? What is it that in|duces thee to put the capital of Canada, and, with it, the whole country, upon &s;o de&s;perate a ri&s;que as the event of the en&s;uing battle? Perhaps thou relie&s;t on thy &s;uperior numbers. But do&s;t thou not know both Briti&s;h troops and French ones better, than to think the latter can &s;tand before the former on even ground, tho' the di&s;proportion of numbers be &s;o great? Is there not &s;omething el&s;e of more con&s;equence than numbers, when things are brought to &s;uch a cri&s;is as the pre&s;ent? Do&s;t thou not know, that God has given men different nerves, &s;inews, arms and hearts? Do&s;t thou not know, that tho&s;e who fight for a Tyrant, will not fight like free-born Britons?

<P>This, my brethren, is the Lord's doing; a great thing which he has performed for us, for our country and nation, whereof we are glad; and it may ju&s;tly be wonderful in our eyes!

Since the &s;urrender of Quebec, we may, without much pre&s;umption, look on Canada as a conquered country. For, as was ob&s;erved above, according to the ordinary cour&s;e of things, if we keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this capital, to prevent which we know of nothing at pre&s;ent, the inhabitants mu&s;t &s;oon be obliged to &s;ubmit to terms, or el&s;e do what will be far wor&s;e for them|&s;elves, tho' not for us perhaps, the matter being con|&s;idered only in a political light.

more particularly upon this point in the after|noon, when we come to con&s;ider the importance of this acqui&s;ition; and how much rea&s;on we have to be glad and rejoice, on account of the great things which God has done for us, e&s;pecially in the &s;ignal victory we have been &s;peaking of, and the &s;urrender of Quebec in con&s;equence of it.</P>
<P>IT may be added here, that as things have turned out, through the good providence of God, almo&s;t the only unfavourable circum&s;tance, worthy of a par|ticular mention here, relative to this great and pro&s;|perous enterprize, and which was taken notice of above, is productive of another, different one, which in a great mea&s;ure, if not entirely, counter|balances it. For that fleet, with her convoy, which arrived at Quebec &s;o opportunely for the enemy, is indi&s;putably and wholly lo&s;t to France; and, not im|probably, before this time in our own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.

<HEAD>Di&s;cour&s;e II. What great Cau&s;e we have for Gladne&s;s and Rejoicing.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>PSALM CXXVI. Ver&s;e 3d.</HI></BIBL>
<P>THE LORD hath done great Things for us, whereof we are glad.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the morning you were reminded of the great things which God hath lately done for us, for our land and nation; particularly in the reduction, or &s;urrender, of the Capital of Canada; which is the principal occa&s;ion of this day's &s;olemnity. How|ever, it was thought not improper to come to a con&s;i|deration of this, by an induction of &s;ome other of our late military &s;ucce&s;&s;es which proceeded it. According|ly we extended our views, on this great and joyful oc|ca&s;ion, to the principal &s;ucce&s;&s;es with which God has favoured us on this continent, &s;ince the time of our la&s;t public and general thank&s;giving; to tho&s;e at the lakes George and Champlain; at Niagara and Du Que&s;ne, now Pittsburgh. We al&s;o ca&s;t an eye towards the We&s;t-India i&s;lands; the coa&s;ts of Portugal and France; towards Hanover and the Pru&s;&s;ian dominions; nor did even the Ea&s;t Indies altogether e&s;cape our notice. In all the&s;e parts, it has plea&s;ed God to give &s;ome
<PB N="34" REF="008417_0033_102F29D7E36D32D8">
&s;ucce&s;s to the arms of our King, or tho&s;e of his allies; and in &s;everal of them, very great and remarkable &s;ucce&s;s. But that, in the reduction of Quebec, con&s;i|dered in it&s;elf, in its probable con&s;equences, and its va&s;t importance to our&s;elves, is &s;o great that it may, with re&s;pect to us, naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed to dimini&s;h from the greatne&s;s, and eclip&s;e the lu&s;tre of the re&s;t. And be|&s;ides&punc; as this was the chief and more particular occa|&s;ion of our a&s;&s;embling together this day in the hou&s;e of prai&s;e, it was, on that account, proper to dwell longer upon it, than upon any of the others.</P>
<P>SOME remarks were of cour&s;e dropped in the pre|ceeding di&s;cour&s;e, on the importance of the&s;e &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;es, and the grounds we have for gladne&s;s and rejoicing on account of them. But the&s;e were only tran&s;ient hints; and as a fuller repre&s;entation of the im|portance of the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es may be u&s;eful to us, and a means of increa&s;ing our gratitude to almighty God, who has done &s;uch great things for us; I now pro|ceed, as was propo&s;ed,</P>
<P N="2">II. MORE particularly to &s;how the propriety of our being glad and rejoicing at this time, and what great rea&s;on we have for it; particularly in re&s;pect of that im|portant event, which is the more immediate occa&s;ion of this &s;olemnity. And indeed my di&s;cour&s;e this after|noon, will be in a manner confined hereto, and to &s;uch reflections as naturally ari&s;e from it; for I &s;hall hardly, if at all, mention any of our other late military &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es, however con&s;iderable in them&s;elves. This, it is conceived, is an event, not only great in it&s;elf, but big with many happy con&s;equences; in &s;hort, an event of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting nature to us, to Great Britain, and all her dependencies; as will pre&s;ently be at|tempted to be &s;hown.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="008417_0034_102F29DA70DE50A0">THE rea&s;onablene&s;s and propriety in general, of rejoicing on &s;uch-like occa&s;ions as the pre&s;ent; for vic|tories over, or &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t our enemies, when God is plea&s;ed to grant it, are &s;o obvious in them&s;elves, &s;o plainly &s;uppo&s;ed in the holy &s;criptures, and, it may be added, this is &s;o frequently enjoined therein as a duty; yea, this is what we are &s;o naturally di&s;po&s;ed to do, that there will not be the lea&s;t need of labouring this point. However, it may ju&s;t be ob&s;erved here, that it was on occa&s;ion of the I&s;raelites being delivered out of the Hands of their oppre&s;&s;ors and enemies, that the P&s;alm of which the text is a part, was compo&s;ed. For it begins thus: "When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dreamed: <HI>then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with &s;inging.</HI>" This, and &s;ome of the happy circum|&s;tances attending, or happy con&s;equences flowing from it, were plainly the "great things" to which the text refers; and on account of which, the church of God that was of old is introduced, expre&s;&s;ing her gratitude and joy, &s;aying, "The Lord hath done great things for us, <HI>whereof we are glad.</HI>" Nor, indeed, can we ever have any cau&s;e for gratitude, on the&s;e, or other occa&s;ions, any further than we have cau&s;e for joy and gladne&s;s. For gratitude or thank&s;giving is due to al|mighty God, only for the favours and mercies which he vouch&s;afes to be&s;tow upon us; all which are, in their own nature, a proper Ground of gladne&s;s and rejoicing to us. And our gratitude ought always to ari&s;e in proportion to the greatne&s;s of the&s;e mercies and favours; or to the real occa&s;ion which we have to rejoice and be glad.</P>
<P>TO repre&s;ent to you, what great cau&s;e we have to rejoice on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, is therefore in other words, or in effect, only to repre&s;ent to you what great
<PB N="36" REF="008417_0035_102F29DEF6CB7740">
rea&s;on we have to be thankful to almighty God, which is what I have in view. It is further to be ob&s;erved here, that as the favours we are con&s;idering, are primarily and chiefly of a national, &s;ecular and political nature, relating more immediately to our common temporal pro&s;perity, tho' remotely to our religious liberties, and &s;piritual good; &s;o it will be proper, and even nece&s;&s;ary, if I &s;peak particularly of them at all, to con&s;ider them, at lea&s;t primarily, in a national, &s;ecular and political light: For, how things of this nature can po&s;&s;ibly be con&s;idered with propriety in any other, I mu&s;t confe&s;s my&s;elf not able to &s;ee. And this mu&s;t be my apology, it is hoped a &s;ufficient one, if on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion I &s;hould verge a little nearer to what is commonly called politics, than is or|dinarily convenient or &s;uitable for the pulpit. Tho' in reality, I &s;hall not di&s;cour&s;e on politics, unle&s;s all kind of di&s;cour&s;e relating to &s;ecular affairs, and the temporal pro&s;perity of nations, may properly be called politics al&s;o. And altho' I do not think it my pro|vince, were I capable of it, to enter deep into matters of this nature, which is far from my de&s;ign; yet it is humbly conceived, I &s;hall not tran&s;gre&s;s by offering &s;ome con&s;iderations in order to &s;how, what great rea&s;on we have for rejoicing at this time; e&s;pecially on account of that acqui&s;ition, which is the principal occa&s;ion of our rejoicing. In order whereto, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to illu&s;trate the importance of that acqui&s;ition it&s;elf, to us, to the&s;e Briti&s;h colonies and provinces in general, and to Great Britain. This is therefore what will now be attempted, without any further apology.</P>
<P>AND to this end, the following things may be ob&s;erved; <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="008417_0036_102F29E08AB74940">THAT the enemy, having lo&s;t the capital of Canada, have it not in their power to recover the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it:</P>
<P>THAT if it remains in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, all Canada mu&s;t of cour&s;e be &s;ubjected in time, even tho' we &s;hould act only upon the defen&s;ive:</P>
<P>THAT as things are now circum&s;tanced, we have it in our power to act offen&s;ively in &s;uch a manner, that the whole country may and mu&s;t, be reduced in a very little while:</P>
<P>THAT the Reduction of this country, will be the bringing all our &s;avage enemies into a friendly alliance with us:</P>
<P>AND then, &s;ince it may po&s;&s;ibly be demanded by &s;ome, What benefits will from hence re&s;ult to us, tak|ing the&s;e things for granted, this demand will be an|&s;wered by a particular, tho' brief induction of &s;ome great advantages accruing from hence, both to Great Britain and her American colonies, who&s;e intere&s;ts are indeed in&s;eparably connected, as both &s;he and they are, of late, more than ever convinced.</P>
<P>THESE are the things which are propo&s;ed under this head. Only it is here premi&s;ed once for all, to pre|vent frequent and needle&s;s repetitions, that when it is &s;aid, &s;uch or &s;uch a thing may, will or mu&s;t be done, or come to pa&s;s; and that another will not, or cannot, both mu&s;t be under&s;tood, as they are intended, with all due &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the over-ruling providence of God, and with proper allowances for extraordinary occurrents. There is doubtle&s;s a certain e&s;tabli&s;hed order of things, or &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of events, which tho' it may be, and &s;ome|times is, broken in upon, is yet a good foundation for
<PB N="38" REF="008417_0037_102F29E219CD06B8">
us to proceed upon in our rea&s;oning as to things of this nature. And otherwi&s;e, indeed, all rea&s;oning about them would be mere childi&s;h impertinence. But &s;till there is no ab&s;olute certainty in any of our conclu&s;ions re&s;pecting them, &s;ince they have &s;ome contingencies for their ba&s;es; contingencies with re&s;pect to us, but which are yet both foreknown and ordered by the &s;upreme Go|vernor of the univer&s;e, to whom therefore we &s;hould always look, in an humble &s;en&s;e of both their, and our, ab&s;olute dependence upon him. Having premi&s;ed the&s;e things once for all, and &s;till keeping them in mind; I now return to the fir&s;t of the propo&s;itions laid down above; <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>THAT having lo&s;t the capital of Canada, the enemy have it not in their power to regain the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. To be &s;ure, they have no Force now in America capable of doing this. Their principal and grand army has been beaten, routed, and cut to pieces; their chief military officers killed and made pri&s;oners; and the poor remains of their regular troops, which were in that memorable battle, &s;ent to Great Britain. If their principal force united under &s;o experienced and capa|ble a commander, with other good officers, was not able to defend their capital, what can be expected, or what need be apprehended from them now, broken and di&s;concerted, without a &s;ufficient number of good officers, without &s;pirit, and perhaps without a &s;ufficiency of provi&s;ions and military &s;tores?</P>
<P>IF this capital is regained, it mu&s;t therefore be by means of large &s;uccours from old France; or rather by an army well &s;upplied and appointed, &s;ent from thence into Canada, to join the forces already there. But this is, humanly &s;peaking, impo&s;&s;ible. The mi&s;&s;i|&s;ipi is at too great a di&s;tance, and the navigation of it
<PB N="39" REF="008417_0038_102F29E3B55E9CE8">
&s;uch, that no con&s;iderable &s;uccours can come that way. Be&s;ides, we are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Niagara, the only way of communication; which fortre&s;s might, were there occa&s;ion, be reinforced almo&s;t with what num|bers we plea&s;e. Neither is it to be &s;uppo&s;ed that an army, or any con&s;iderable &s;uccours, can come to Ca|nada by the river St. Lawrence, of which we have now the command. The Briti&s;h navy is &s;o &s;uperior that the ports of France, where any preparations &s;hould be made for this purpo&s;e, might be blocked up. Or if a fleet &s;hould happen to &s;teal out in the &s;pring, a &s;uperior one might be immediately di&s;patched after it, &s;o as to prevent its effecting any thing; and proba|bly take or de&s;troy it. Or a &s;trong Briti&s;h &s;quadron, were that judged needful, or advi&s;eable, might be kept con&s;tantly in the river, during the &s;ea&s;on for navigating it. All which things being con&s;idered, we need be under no apprehen&s;ions, but that we &s;hall be able to maintain that acqui&s;ition, which has been lately made with &s;o much honor to the Briti&s;h arms. And we will now venture to advance one &s;tep farther. For, as was ob&s;erved above,</P>
<P>IF this Capital remains in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, all Canada mu&s;t of cour&s;e be &s;ubjected in time, even tho' we &s;hould here act only a defen&s;ive part. Some may, perhaps, think this a pretty extraordinary and &s;anguine po&s;ition. It admits, however, of a very &s;hort and ea&s;y proof. For many European commodities are, from u&s;e and habit, become nece&s;&s;ary to the Canadians; &s;o that they neither will, nor can, live long without them. With the&s;e they cannot be &s;upplied from old France, as affairs are now circum&s;tanced, either by the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ipi, or St. Lawrence, or any other way. Their commu|nication with France is now effectually cut off, unle&s;s perhaps it be for <HI>letters of condoleance,</HI> which can nei|ther
<PB N="40" REF="008417_0039_102F29E62A4BDD98">
do us any harm, nor them&s;elves much good. So that if the war &s;hould continue, they will be obliged to come to us for the&s;e nece&s;&s;aries; and to take them of us, if at all, on our own terms: Which would, in effect be &s;ubjecting them&s;elves and their country to the Briti&s;h government. At lea&s;t, this is what they might be compelled to do, &s;hould tho&s;e above us think it proper. And the&s;e remarks, tho' made with particu|lar reference to the Canadians properly &s;o called, are equally applicable to all the French inhabitants on this continent about the lakes, and to the &s;outhward of them, till you come near the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ipi, or &s;ome of its branch|es that are very remote from us; Quebec, and the river St Lawrence, now in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, being the way in which they u&s;e, chiefly at lea&s;t, to be &s;upplied with tho&s;e nece&s;&s;aries; for which, if they continue in the country, they will be forced in time to come to us; even tho' we &s;hould act only on the defen&s;ive with re&s;pect to them. However, there is no need of going on this latter &s;uppo&s;ition: For, in the next place, as was ob&s;erved above,</P>
<P>AS things are now circum&s;tanced, we have it in our power to act offen&s;ively again&s;t them in &s;uch a manner, that the whole country may, and mu&s;t be reduced in a very little time. They can receive no con&s;iderable &s;uc|cours or &s;upplies from Old France, for the rea&s;ons mentioned above. They have no cities, forts or pla|ces of defence, capable of making re&s;i&s;tance, or holding out a &s;iege, even a &s;hort one. The country lies open to us; or rather, we have one army at lea&s;t already in the heart of it. His Maje&s;ty has a large number of brave and try'd troops now in America; &s;o many, that all the forces the enemy can collect, probably would not dare to meet one half of them in the field: That method they have already try'd to their co&s;t! And tho' the country &s;hould not &s;ubmit, or be intirely &s;ubjected
<PB N="41" REF="008417_0040_102F29E96362AF70">
this fall, which is not indeed to be expected, con&s;ider|ing how far the &s;ea&s;on is already elap&s;ed; yet what &s;hould prevent a total conque&s;t, even very early another &s;ea&s;on; when the enemy mu&s;t be &s;till in all probability, more weakened, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and di&s;pirited, than they are at pre&s;ent? Excepting &s;uch things as are quite out of the ordinary cour&s;e, nothing can prevent this. Which being con&s;idered, the reduction of Que|bec is, in effect, the reduction of all Canada, from Hud&s;on's Bay &s;outhward and we&s;tward to the great lakes: and not only &s;o, but of all the territory which the French po&s;&s;e&s;s to the &s;outhward &s;till of tho&s;e lakes till, as was &s;aid before, you come near the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ipi, or &s;ome of tho&s;e branches of it, which are at a very great di&s;tance from us.</P>
<P>OUR next po&s;ition was, that the reduction of this country, will be the bringing all our Indian enemies into a friendly alliance with us. For Quebec &amp; Canada being in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, they cannot be &s;upplied from thence as heretofore, with arms, ammunition and other things, which long u&s;e has been made nece&s;&s;ary to them. They mu&s;t therefore come to us for them; and be obliged to court our friend&s;hip. And this rea&s;oning will hold good with re&s;pect to all the numerous &s;avage nations, quite from the territories of Hud&s;ons Bay, where the Indians have long been our friends, down to the great lakes, and to the &s;outhward of them, as far as Georgia; and We&s;tward, till we approach near the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ipi. Whereever they can be &s;upplied ea&s;ie&s;t, and upon the be&s;t terms, e&s;pecially if it be by tho&s;e who are the mo&s;t powerful on the continent, and can give them the greate&s;t protection &amp; a&s;&s;i&s;tance in ca&s;e of need; there they will, &s;ooner or later, come to be &s;upplied. And this, probably, in a &s;hort time, provided tho&s;e pru|dent mea&s;ures continue to be pro&s;ecuted with reference
<PB N="42" REF="008417_0041_102F29EC19226ED8">
to them, which have lately been u&s;ed. For we &s;ee them now daily for&s;aking the French intere&s;t, coming over to us, and &s;eeking an alliance with us. So that this rea&s;oning is not grounded merely on hypothe&s;is, but partly on certain fact. And it may be added here, that on the foregoing principles, the friend&s;hip of all the&s;e &s;avages may be relied on as hearty &amp; &s;incere, having not only convenience, but even nece&s;&s;ity for its ba&s;is. For they cannot live, but by being and keeping on good terms with us. And &s;o, in &s;hort, they will be a barrier, if one is needed, between our &s;outhern colonies and the French on the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ipi; or, perhaps, with a little of our a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;hould the war continue, make them glad to confine them&s;elves wholly to the we&s;tward of that river.</P>
<P>SAVING the right of the natives, all the territory a|bout Hud&s;on's bay, northward, we&s;tward and &s;outhward as far as the bounds of Canada, already belongs to Great-Britain, where we have long had &s;everal forts and &s;ettlements, of which we are &s;till in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. And upon the foregoing principles, Great-Britain mu&s;t of cour&s;e, in a little time, be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a territory here in North-America, extending and continued from that Bay, and indeed from &s;ome way to the Northward of it, as far as Florida to the &s;outhward, about two thou&s;and miles; and extending as far back to the we&s;tward, almo&s;t, as we &s;hould de&s;ire; re&s;erving always, as was intimated a|bove, to the &s;avage nations, their ju&s;t claims, or proper rights. This is what we may, without much pre&s;ump|tion, promi&s;e our&s;elves, making proper allowance for contingencies, or things out of the ordinary cour&s;e; on which, being unknown, we can ground none of our rea&s;onings in this, or any other ca&s;e. But to &s;ay the lea&s;t, this may probably be the con&s;equence of reducing

Quebec: For all that has been &s;aid above, has a clo&s;e and manife&s;t connection with that important event.</P>
<P>BUT allowing the above conclu&s;ions to be ju&s;tly drawn; yet &s;ome may perhaps demand &s;till, "Cui bono?" Tho' things &s;hould turn out thus; yet what real and con&s;iderable benefit would from hence re&s;ult to Great-Britain and her colonies?

<P>IN the fir&s;t place, one great advantage we &s;hould gain hereby is this, that all the Briti&s;h colonies and provinces would henceforward enjoy peace on their exten&s;ive frontiers, or inland borders. We &s;hall be delivered from the ravages and barbarities of faithle&s;s &s;avages, and more faithle&s;s Frenchmen; of all which ravages and barbarities, the French being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Quebec and St. Lawrence river, has, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, been the principal cau&s;e. For the Indians would all have long &s;ince been our friends, had it not been for them in our neighbourhood, to &s;et them upon us both in war and peace. How much blood has been heretofore &s;hed on the frontiers of the Briti&s;h colonies?

otherwi&s;e very flouri&s;hing, been di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, kept back, and, many of them quite broken up, by the enemy? Whereas we may now rationally expect to have peace in all our borders; and that there will be no more breaking in, or carrying out to a wretched captivity. The public expences, and con&s;equently the public taxes, will be va&s;tly le&s;&s;ened; and become very &s;mall in comparri&s;on of what they have hitherto been in time of war. And we &s;hall &s;ave, not only much money, but, what is far more precious in the &s;ight of God and wi&s;e men, much blood. Our colo|nies will of cour&s;e increa&s;e and people fa&s;t; and, un|der the common ble&s;&s;ing of providence, flouri&s;h more than ever, quickly filling up, and extending them|&s;elves far back into the country. Of which, the mother-country will reap the benefit in common with us. The&s;e are &s;uch great and obvious advantages, that all mu&s;t needs &s;ee them.</P>
<P>IN the next place, an exten&s;ive trade will of cour&s;e be opened with all the &s;avage nations back of us; parti|cularly the fur trade, of late years almo&s;t engro&s;&s;ed by the French, who have had tho&s;e &s;avages in their intere&s;t. They mu&s;t now hunt for us in our turn, in order to pay us for the nece&s;&s;aries which they mu&s;t come to us for. Which is al&s;o in &s;ome mea&s;ure applicable to the Canadians them&s;elves, that country being reduced, if any of them &s;hall remain therein. They mu&s;t all be &s;upplied by us, and pay us for it &s;ome way or other. So that in &s;hort, all the commerce of this part of the world, from the northward of Hud&s;on's Bay to Flori|da,
<PB N="45" REF="008417_0044_102F29F2B1870038">
and back to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ipi, or near it, will of cour&s;e be in the hands of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects: A commerce which will greatly increa&s;e the demand for Briti&s;h manufac|tures, and both well employ and maintain many thou|&s;and more people in Great-Britain, than do or can get a livelihood there at pre&s;ent in any hone&s;t way. It will al&s;o much increa&s;e her navigation, and that of her colonies.</P>
<P>MOREOVER: The reduction of Quebec, and &s;up|po&s;ed reduction of Canada in con&s;equence thereof, will be a benefit to us, as it will be, in &s;ome mea&s;ure at lea&s;t, a cramping of the French &s;ugar-i&s;lands, which have of late much more than rivalled our own. The French We&s;t India i&s;lands, if I am not mi&s;informed, have heretofore had great dependence upon Canada for bread-corn, and other provi&s;ions, for &s;ome kinds of naval &s;tores, and divers other articles, both nece&s;&s;ary for them, and which they cannot, el&s;ewhere, be &s;o commodiou&s;ly &s;upplied with. The depriving them of which, e&s;pecially if an effectual &s;top &s;hould be put to the illicit trade carried on thither from &s;ome Briti&s;h parts of the continent, mu&s;t greatly di&s;tre&s;s and reduce them, and be a proprotionable advantage to ours; le&s;&s;en their commerce and navigation, and increa&s;e our own.</P>
<P>Again: One would think that France would now, almo&s;t of cour&s;e, be wholly cut out of the American cod-fi&s;hery, of which &s;he has heretofore made &s;uch va&s;t advantages. Her Louisbourg fi&s;hery was gone before. That up the gulph and river St. Lawrence is now gone. All treaties, by virtue of which &s;he claimed a right to make fi&s;h on the coa&s;t of Newfound|land, have been violated by her; they are broken thro', and become mere nullities, as tho' they had never
<PB N="46" REF="008417_0045_102F29F7199001A0">
been. And if we &s;hould hold the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Louis|bourg, Canada and Newfoundland, with the coa&s;t of Labrador, one would think it ea&s;y to prevent her making fi&s;h in any of tho&s;e parts, e&s;pecially con&s;ider|ing the great &s;uperiority of the Briti&s;h navy. Nor does it &s;eem improbable that this whole fi&s;hery may fall into the hands of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects; unle&s;s we &s;hould perhaps hereafter have a mini&s;try as complai&s;ant to his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, and the court of Ver&s;ailles, as that in the latter end of Queen Ann's reign, which com|plimented France with the be&s;t places for carrying on the cod-fi&s;hery, in all North-America; i. e. in the world. But at pre&s;ent, to be &s;ure, there is no rea&s;on for any apprehen&s;ions of this &s;ort. Now the de&s;truction of the French fi&s;hery would be the de&s;truction of one mo&s;t material and exten&s;ive branch of her commerce, in which &s;he was before our too &s;ucce&s;sful rival: And this whole fi&s;hery, falling into the hands of Britain, would prodigiou&s;ly increa&s;e her trade and wealth; giving her the advantage of &s;upplying all tho&s;e markets, which France &s;upplied before? This wou'd al&s;o be the le&s;&s;ening of the latter's maritime power in general, and the increa|&s;ing, proportionably, that of Great-Britain. For France, being deprived of this fi&s;hery, could not employ and maintain &s;o many &s;eamen as heretofore, by many thou&s;ands; whereas we might then employ and maintain many thou&s;ands more than ever. This is a con&s;idera|tion of the la&s;t importance to the welfare and &s;afety of Great-Britain, and of her colonies, if not of all Europe; her chief dependence and &s;ecurity, under divine provi|dence, being placed in the &s;uperiority of her naval power, and keeping under that of France. For &s;hould France, who&s;e ambition is &s;o exorbitant and boundle&s;s, and who&s;e power is &s;o great on the continent, once become &s;uperior by &s;ea, the liberties of Great-Britain, and perhaps of Europe, are no more.</P>

<P>And in the fir&s;t place, we &s;hould take heed that our joy is not leavened with pride and vain-glory, as tho' our &s;ucce&s;&s;es were wholly from our&s;elves.

For man has nothing which he did not receive, whe|ther &s;trength, wi&s;dom, courage or magnanimity: Why then &s;hould he glory in it, or in the effects and con|&s;equences of it, "as tho' he had not received it?"</P>
<P>THERE is another thing nearly allied to this, again&s;t which we ought al&s;o to guard. Many people who,

tho' they believe in the over-ruling providence of God, and are far from wholly attributing to them&s;elves, the glory of their victories and &s;ucce&s;&s;es, yet rejoice on &s;uch occa&s;ions under the notion of their having as it were merited them, by their &s;uperior goodne&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s. This is al&s;o a vain, proud joy, not be|coming &s;inful creatures. It is indeed po&s;&s;ible, that we may not be altogether &s;o guilty in the &s;ight of God, as our enemies whom he hath thus far &s;ubdued under us; but we are yet far from being &s;o righteous our&s;elves, as to have merited thereby the &s;ucce&s;&s;es which he has given us again&s;t them. And there is a remarkable pa&s;&s;age in the book of Numbers, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chap. IX.</NOTE> &s;o much to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, that I cannot forbear quoting it. The children of I&s;rael were now about to pa&s;s over the river Jordan, where God had promi&s;ed to drive out the idolatrous nations from before them. But le&s;t they &s;hould a&s;cribe this to their own great piety and good|ne&s;s, he gives them the following caution and admoni|tion: <Q>Under&s;tand therefore this day, that the Lord thy God is he that goeth over before thee as a con|&s;uming fire: he &s;hall de&s;troy them, and &s;hall bring them down before thy face: &s;o &s;halt thou drive them out, and de&s;troy them quickly, as the Lord hath &s;aid unto thee.

Some there are, who &s;eem to think they cannot be &s;ufficiently glad and joyful on &s;uch occa|&s;ions, without behaving more like the ancient Bacchi|nalians, or madmen, than like Chri&s;tians and rea&s;onable creatures; running into many fooli&s;h exce&s;&s;es quite incon&s;i&s;tent, not only with chri&s;tian &s;obriety, but with civil order. Let us be admoni&s;hed to ab&s;tain from every kind and degree of extravagant, riotous mirth. <Q>It is better, &s;ays Solomon, to hear the rebuke of the wi&s;e, than for a man to hear the &s;ong of fools. For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, &s;o is the laughter of fools: this al&s;o is vanity.</Q></P>
<P>IN the next place: We &s;hould be at lea&s;t equally far from taking plea&s;ure in reflecting on the mi&s;eries which our enemies &s;uffer. We may, indeed, rea&s;ona|bly rejoice that God has given us &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t them, as may probably put it out of their power to harm us for the future. But their calamities and di&s;|tre&s;&s;es, con&s;idered in them&s;elves, are no proper ground of gladne&s;s to us. And if any part of our joy on this occa&s;ion ari&s;es from hence, &s;o far it is contrary to the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel. If we have good and benevolent hearts, we cannot but be touched with pity for tho&s;e unhappy people, however malicious they have been towards us; e&s;pecially for the poor women and chil|dren, who can hardly be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been "in this tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion," with the re&s;t. Yea, if we could relieve them in their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, without hazard to our|&s;elves and the public, the great law of charity would oblige us to do it; whereby we &s;hould fulfil that evan|gelical command, <Q>If thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thir&s;t, give him drink: For in &s;o doing thou &s;halt heap coals of fire upon his head.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="008417_0053_102F2A0ADF96DA60">AGAIN: We &s;hould by no means plea&s;e our&s;elves with any &s;uch thought as this on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, that being at re&s;t from our enemies, we may hereafter have it in our power to lead a &s;oft and luxurious, an indolent or effeminate life; con&s;uming the bounties of divine providence on our lu&s;ts. To plea&s;e and delight our&s;elves with any &s;uch thought, with any &s;uch hopes as the&s;e, were to rejoice, not as Chri&s;tians, but as Epicures; and would be a certain indication of a corrupt, &s;en&s;ual turn of mind.</P>
<P>BUT having dwelt long enough on the negative here, it may be proper to propo&s;e &s;ome more direct and po&s;itive rules, to guide and a&s;&s;i&s;t us in pointing our joy aright on this great occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>AND here, in the fir&s;t place, we &s;hould <Q>rejoice in the Lord;</Q> in him who has done the&s;e great things for us, whereof we are glad. We are to con|&s;ider God as the &s;upreme author of our victories and &s;ucce&s;&s;es. <Q>All that is in the heaven, and in the earth is his; and in his hand it is to make great, and to give &s;trength unto all.</Q> However brave, prudent and magnanimous the per&s;ons are, or were, to whom we immediately owe the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es, they are yet to be con&s;idered only as the in&s;truments and &s;ervants of God, by whom he has wrought &s;uch &s;alvation, &s;uch great things for us. Thine, O Lord! is <Q>the glory, and the victory, and the maje&s;ty.</Q></P>
<P>WE &s;hould al&s;o a&s;cribe the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es to God, not merely as the &s;upreme cau&s;e and author, but as the gracious, merciful, and bountiful be&s;tower of them; whom we had laid under no obligation, in point of ju&s;tice, thus to e&s;pou&s;e our cau&s;e, <Q>when men ro&s;e up again&s;t us</Q>&punc; but who might, for our &s;ins, have given
<PB N="55" REF="008417_0054_102F2A0D4BFD65A0">
"us a prey to their teeth," however wicked and un|righteous our enemies them&s;elves may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be, or to have been. And indeed God, in his un|&s;earchable wi&s;dom, &s;ometimes permits the wicked grie|vou&s;ly to afflict &s;uch as are more righteous than them|&s;elves; wherein he is not unju&s;t, &s;ince the <Q>whole world is become guilty before him.</Q></P>
<P>IT is moreover nece&s;&s;ary, that our joy &s;hould be accompanied with unfeigned gratitude, or truly thank|ful hearts. Gladne&s;s on &s;uch an occa&s;ion without &s;in|cere thankfulne&s;s, which is very &s;uppo&s;eable, and per|haps very common, would have no degree of piety or virtue; it would be but a natural, human pa&s;&s;ion, the offspring of &s;elf-love. It is only a grateful joy that becomes chri&s;tians, at lea&s;t, that will entitle us to that honourable character. And it is in this, that a religious <HI>Thanksgiving</HI> mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially con&s;i&s;ts; I mean, in having our hearts truly touched and warm|ed with a &s;en&s;e of God's unde&s;erved goodne&s;s to us: Tho' it is highly expedient that this &s;hould be out|wardly expre&s;&s;ed, by talking of his loving-kindne&s;s, by devoutly &s;inging his prai&s;es, and a&s;cribing to him ble&s;&s;ing and honor, glory and power.</P>
<P>OUR rejoicing in the goodne&s;s of our God to us, &s;hould al&s;o be attended with unfeigned good-will and charity towards men. Indeed a proper &s;en&s;e of God's mercies has a natural tendency to &s;often and expand the heart of man; to fill it with the warme&s;t wi&s;hes for the good, the eternal good of o|thers. And if we feel no &s;uch benevolence, or cha|rity, in our brea&s;ts, it is almo&s;t a certain &s;ign that there is in them no religious or virtuous joy; and that however full we may be of gladne&s;s or mirth upon this occa&s;ion, it is only the mirth or gladne&s;s of &s;en|&s;ual
<PB N="56" REF="008417_0055_102F2A0FCBA00F18">
men; of men under the influence of natural hu|man pa&s;&s;ions and affections only, at be&s;t; but po&s;&s;i|bly of &s;uch as are much wor&s;e, <HI>unnatural</HI> ones.</P>
<P>MOREOVER; Our rejoicing in the goodne&s;s of God to us on this occa&s;ion, &s;hould be accompanied with &s;incere re&s;olutions to make the mo&s;t proper and wor|thy returns to him that we po&s;&s;ibly can; i. e. to keep his commandments, and live to his glory. Truly grateful and religious joy is never unattended with &s;uch-like pious and virtuous re&s;olutions. And in|deed, after all that has been &s;aid in the former part of this di&s;cour&s;e, concerning the greatne&s;s and impor|tance of tho&s;e things which God has done for us, the chief, or rather the &s;um-total of the advantage is, that we may, if we have hearts for it, hereafter <Q>lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty;</Q> to do which, is the &s;upreme good of man in this world, and the only way to obtain immortal joys in the next.</P>
<P>FINALLY here; We &s;hould "rejoice with trem|bling". We &s;hould exerci&s;e an humble dependence upon almighty God, in who&s;e hand all future events are; whether pro&s;perous or adver&s;e to us, we can|not certainly fore&s;ee; but we &s;hall know hereafter. We &s;hould be far from a vain confidence that God, who has done &s;uch great things for us, will not in &s;ome other re&s;pects frown upon us, and &s;orely cha|&s;tize us. We may well tremble, or at lea&s;t fear in &s;ome mea&s;ure, le&s;t he &s;hould do thus: E&s;pecially if, in&s;tead of making proper returns of love and obedience to him for the&s;e mercies, we &s;hould forget, or mi&s;im|prove them. Even the pro&s;perity of fools often de|&s;troys them, when their enemies could not do it. And when we con&s;ider our own numerous frailties,
<PB N="57" REF="008417_0056_102F2A128851A768">
follies and corruptions, we may well tremble amid&s;t all our joys, le&s;t we &s;hould prove as wicked and un|grateful as many have been before us; who &s;ung God's prai&s;es, but &s;oon forgot his works; &s;inking under the ble&s;&s;ings they enjoyed, into indolence, di&s;&s;o|lutene&s;s and impiety. How guilty &s;hould we be, if we &s;hould increa&s;e the number of &s;uch, after God has thus manife&s;ted his great goodne&s;s to us, and laid us under &s;uch obligations! However, what is here &s;aid is by no means de&s;igned to damp, but only to regulate our common joy, and the hopes which the&s;e late &s;ucce&s;&s;es may naturally rai&s;e in us re&s;pecting our future pro&s;pe|rity; e&s;pecially if we &s;hould conduct our&s;elves, in con&s;equence of them, as becomes wi&s;e men and chri|&s;tians.</P>
<P>IT were, indeed, an argument both of our in&s;en&s;i|bility and our ingratitude, not to rejoice on &s;o noble an occa&s;ion. We, I mean New-England, and all the Briti&s;h American plantations, had never &s;o much cau&s;e for general joy as we have at pre&s;ent; while we &s;ee our&s;elves in &s;o fair a way, under the ble&s;|&s;ing of providence, to be wholly delivered from our enemies in the&s;e parts. Had the French retained their power, and independency of us here in America, we might be certain from more than an hundred years &s;ad experience of them, that they would &s;till be, not only our enemies, but fal&s;e, perfidious and barbarous ones; and not only &s;o, but that the greater part of the &s;avages &s;till in&s;tigated, as they are already infatuated by them, would be our enemies al&s;o. Canada, even tho' the French &s;hould relinqui&s;h all their encroach|ments, and retire within their old proper bounds, is yet &s;o near to us, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for Frenchmen, retaining their power, and their independency on
<PB N="58" REF="008417_0057_102F2A1529A42BE8">
Great-Britain, to inhabit that country without being pernicious enemies to us, in peace as well as war. Of this we have had experience, much more than &s;uffici|ent: We have &s;adly felt the effects of their perfidy, and of long wars with the &s;avages, wholly owing to them.</P>
<P>WE have all along been more or le&s;s di&s;quieted, often greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, by the&s;e our American enemies: And there was a time, not long &s;ince, when we had con&s;iderable rea&s;on to apprehend what the con&s;equence might be; how far fatal to our&s;elves, and the Briti&s;h intere&s;t in America. We had &s;ome rea&s;on for this, whether we reflect how the enemy conducted, or we our&s;elves conducted, at that time: When they had a &s;trong chain of forts quite round us, and boa&s;ted that they had us in a pound: When, not only all the per|fidy, which is nothing new or &s;trange, but almo&s;t all the policy, the prudence, the military &s;pirit, and I may add, the &s;ucce&s;s al&s;o, &s;eemed to have fallen to <HI>their</HI> &s;hare! The&s;e things then look'd with a dark and threatning a&s;pect on the Briti&s;h affairs in America, and, con&s;equently, in Europe al&s;o. But ble&s;&s;ed be God, that the &s;cene is &s;o much changed! "The &s;nare is broken, and we are e&s;caped." The power of the French is now broken, at lea&s;t here in America; and not likely to be recovered. Our heathen enemies have no longer cau&s;e to "&s;hoot out the lip," to deride and in&s;ult us, &s;aying, Where is their boa&s;ted &s;trength? "Where is their God?" Even they mu&s;t now con|fe&s;s that the Lord hath done great things for us, whereof they al&s;o may in time probably be glad, how &s;orrowful &s;oever they may be at pre&s;ent. And having offered up our prai&s;es to heaven for the&s;e favours, we can now make no prayer more &s;ea&s;onable, than that God would be plea&s;ed &s;o deeply to impre&s;s our
<PB N="59" REF="008417_0058_102F2A16BAE37C38">
hearts with a &s;en&s;e of his goodne&s;s, that it may never be effaced; but that we may always remain humbly and obediently thankful for it.</P>
<P>IF we have but hearts to live an&s;werably to the&s;e mercies, we may expect to &s;ee far "greater things than thefe." We have given many outward demon|&s;trations of our joy. To pa&s;s over &s;ome others, we have chim'd bells, and cannon have roar'd; bon|fires have blaz'd on every hill; colors have been di&s;|play'd; our hou&s;es have been gaily illuminated; and many a &s;plendid rocket has been thrown to illuminate and adorn the &s;kies them&s;elves. Such have been the civil demon&s;trations of our joy on this great occa&s;ion. And we have now as &s;oon indeed, as could well be, manife&s;ted our joy in a religious manner, by ob&s;erving this day of public and general thank&s;giving. The former I do not cen&s;ure; the latter is doubtle&s;s to be commended. What remains then, but that we now give the highe&s;t and be&s;t evidence of all, that we have a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the&s;e favours, and are truly thankful for them; I mean, by "denying ungodline&s;s, and worldly lu&s;ts, and living &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and god|ly in the world?" That we may lead quiet and peaceable lives in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty, is indeed the mo&s;t, if not the only, rational and worthy end we can have in view, in any of our military undertakings. And when once providence has, or &s;hall have, put it in our power to live thus, the great end of war being an&s;wered, we are wholly inexcu&s;able if we live other|wi&s;e; particularly if we &s;hould "turn a&s;ide to vain jangling" among&s;t our&s;elves, "doting about que&s;ti|ons and &s;trifes of words, whereof cometh envy, &s;trife, railings, evil-&s;urmi&s;ings, and perver&s;e di&s;putings;" in&s;tead of "&s;tudying the things that make for peace, and the things whereby we may edify one another."</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="008417_0059_102F2A1A14CE3F88">IF we &s;hould henceforth live as becomes fellow-&s;ubjects, and fellow-chri&s;tians, in the fear of God, and brotherly-love, &s;till "abhorring that which is evil, and cleaving to that which is good," we might then rea|&s;onable hope to &s;ee our&s;elves e&s;tabli&s;hed without any rivals, much le&s;s perfidious and cruel enemies, in this good land, of &s;uch a va&s;t extent; and that our po&s;te|rity after us will al&s;o be glad of tho&s;e great things which God has done, and is &s;till doing for us. Even they will <Q>abundantly utter the memory of his great goodne&s;s, and talk of his righteou&s;ne&s;s,</Q> if we and they become, and continue, a willing and obedient people.

<P>I can &s;carce forbear fancying, that I hear a venera|ble &s;ire talking after this manner to his child, of things that came to pa&s;s in old times, the days of his fore|fathers: <Q>My &s;on, the&s;e friends and brethren of our's, whom you &s;ee of a darker complexion than our|&s;elves, were once our heathen enemies, and vexed our fathers in the wilderne&s;s; (for this was once &s;uch!)

<PB N="62" REF="008417_0061_102F2A1F0E9CCC88">
with them, and without provocation, endeavoured to de&s;troy our fathers out of the land. But &s;everal hundred years ago, when GEORGE the II. an excellent King, &s;at upon the Briti&s;h throne, and a certain wi&s;e and good man, named PITT, was his mini&s;ter, a great General was &s;ent with a little army, to take the enemy's chief city. The name of this brave general was WOLFE; but the name of the enemy's general is forgotten. All we know of the latter is, that &s;ome time before, the army <HI>under his command</HI> perfidiou&s;ly murder'd a great number of our people, after they had &s;urrender'd a certain fortre&s;s to him, and he had plighted them his faith!&mdash;But the &s;trong city of the enemy I ju&s;t now &s;poke of, was taken after a bloody battle, and their whole country was &s;oon &s;ubdued. From that time God, who loved our fathers, gave them re&s;t on every &s;ide. They then grew and flouri&s;hed mightily, and filled the whole land. Such great things, my dear child! did God perform for our fathers in the days of old; for which we have cau&s;e to be glad and rejoice to this time, and prai&s;e his glorious name</Q>&mdash;But whither will ima|gination tran&s;port me! into what times and regions, if I do not check it!&mdash;</P>

Fallen, tho' in youthful ardor, yet not without the pru|dence and wi&s;dom of age! Tho' without an heir; yet &s;uch as thou wa&s;t need not children to bear up, and immortalize their name! And thou ha&s;t here left at lea&s;t one whole grateful country, where all, old as well as young, will honor thee as a father, and enjoy thy fame, as well as the fruit of thy toils! Tho' far from the country which gave thee birth, yet near one which would glory might it be &s;aid, that "this man was born here!"

<P>WHEN I reflect upon the&s;e circum&s;tances of his fall, I am obliged to retract what I &s;aid before: He that fell &s;o gloriou&s;ly, did not fall untimely. No! He falls not untimely, who falls in the &s;ervice of his King and country with &s;uch magnanimity, with the vigor of youth and the wi&s;dom of age united; e&s;pecially if he falls a conqueror, as this brave general did. Whoever falls thus in the di&s;charge of his duty; thus greatly, thus victoriou&s;ly, and with &s;uch glorious circum&s;tances attending his fall, being &s;uppo&s;ed to be an upright good man, falls not immaturely, but "in a good old age." Whether he had lived many years or few, is little to the point. Not he that draws and re&s;pires this vital air the oftene&s;t; not he that &s;leeps the mo&s;t nights, or wakes the mo&s;t days; not he that pa&s;&s;es thro' the mo&s;t &s;ummers and winters; in fine, not he that &s;ees the mo&s;t &s;uns and &s;ea&s;ons rolling over him in &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion; this is not he that lives the longe&s;t, or that dies the mo&s;t maturely. There is another, a far ju&s;|ter &s;tandard of age, of life and death: And he who lives the mo&s;t u&s;efully, the mo&s;t to the proper ends and purpo&s;es of life, lives, both the mo&s;t honourably, and the longe&s;t, and makes the mo&s;t mature, as well as glorious exit.&mdash;<Q>Honourable age is not that which &s;tandeth in length of time, or that is mea&s;ured by number of years: But wi&s;dom is the GREY HAIR unto men, and an un&s;potted life is OLD AGE!</Q></P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="008417_0064_102F2A269A753180">MY Brethren, tho' my heart relented when I be|gan to &s;peak of this Briti&s;h hero's fall in the vigor of his life; yet by means of &s;uch reflections as the&s;e, which are the &s;ugge&s;tions, not of pa&s;&s;ion, that erroneous guide, but of rea&s;on, which will not lead us a&s;tray; by means of &s;uch reflections, I &s;ay, I find my &s;pirits &s;o far returned, that I could now almo&s;t congratulate you on his noble exit, in&s;tead of condoling with you on it! However, not to carry this matter beyond ju&s;t bounds: Who would not die as this brave commander died, to be both remembred and honored in future times, rather than live a while as &s;ome others have lived, and then die to be forgotten; or if not en|tirely forgotten, yet remembered only as having in their day given the mo&s;t flagrant and inglorious proofs, that they were not in places adapted to their talents, when they were found at the head of armies!</P>
<P>BUT &s;till you will &s;ay, that not only we, but the nation, has &s;u&s;tained a great lo&s;s in the fall of this ex|cellent commander. Far be it from me to deny this! But ble&s;&s;ed be God, the nation has other wi&s;e, brave, and magnanimous commanders; One <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen.

Nor will Great-Britain ever be de&s;titute of &s;uch commanders, till either her happy government is &s;ubverted, and her liberties lo&s;t; or till tho&s;e glorious times &s;hall come, when in&s;tead of "learning war any more," all the nations which have hitherto by their mutual enmity and violence, been as it were &s;courges in the hand of almighty God, to

puni&s;h one another for their &s;ins, &s;hall at length "beat their &s;words into plough-&s;hares, and their &s;pears into pruning-hooks;" being both too wi&s;e, and too vir|tuous, thus to "hurt and de&s;troy" each other. At lea&s;t &s;uch commanders will never be wanting in Great-Britain, during a reign and admini&s;tration like the pre&s;ent, wherein &s;uperior merit is &s;o early ob&s;erved, and &s;o gloriou&s;ly di&s;tingui&s;hed!</P>
<P>LET us not therefore de&s;pond under this lo&s;s. We could not expect, according to the e&s;tabli&s;h'd cour&s;e of human affairs, even under the peculiar favour and &s;miles of heaven, to do great things, or obtain great advantages again&s;t our enemies, without &s;ome circum|&s;tances attending them, which cannot be thought of but with regret. It becomes us, therefore, to &s;ubmit with patience to what we could all wi&s;h otherwi&s;e, and to be heartily thankful for what is &s;o agreeable to our de&s;ires, &s;o great in it&s;elf, and &s;o important in its con&s;equences. <Q>For &s;hall we receive good at the hand of God, and &s;hall we not receive evil?</Q></P>
<P>IF &s;uch reflexions as &s;ome of tho&s;e above, tho' I can hardly &s;uppo&s;e it, &s;hould &s;eem to any not &s;uitable to the pre&s;ent &s;ea&s;on, or to a day of general joy and thank&s;|giving, I have only this apology to make: That they were in a manner forced upon me by that great and happy event it&s;elf, which is the &s;pecial occa&s;ion of our rejoicing. For, to have taken no notice of the fall of that excellent general, by means of who&s;e almo&s;t unex|ampled bravery and good conduct, this important acqui|&s;ition was made, would have been both ungrateful and inhuman. And if it were mentioned at all, not to have &s;poken of it in a grave and &s;erious, but light and in|different manner, would have been &s;till more ungrate|ful and inhuman, with the additional bad circum|&s;tances of being gro&s;ly ab&s;urd and unnatural, not to

&s;ay impious. For, not only the fall of &s;uch di&s;tin|gui&s;hed per&s;onages, but death it&s;elf, is a very grave and &s;erious &s;ubject to be thought or &s;poken of. Do any of you doubt it? You will &s;oon be of the &s;ame opinion: For, human life is &s;hort, and "after death the judgment!"</P>
<P>This further <HI>&s;erious</HI> reflexion would not have been added to the former, had not the &s;peaker cho&s;en to &s;ee this a&s;&s;embly di&s;&s;olve, each one with a grave and &s;olemn brow, much rather than with an air and coun|tenance of thoughtle&s;s levity, tho' the occa&s;ion of our coming together was &s;o truly joyful.

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Containing a brief Account of two former Expeditions again&s;t QUEBEC and CANADA, which proved un&s;ucce&s;sful.</HEAD>
<P>MANY people among&s;t us, both in the town and country, who have heard frequent mention of former enterprizes again&s;t Quebec and Canada, have probably, either thro' want of books, or lei&s;ure to con&s;ult &s;uch as are of any con&s;iderable length, no di&s;tinct knowledge of tho&s;e unfortunate expeditions. This is a &s;ea&s;on wherein there is of cour&s;e much conver&s;ation about that city and country; and many who may have a curio&s;ity, have not the advantages before-mentioned, to ac|quaint them&s;elves even with the mo&s;t material facts and cir|cum&s;tances relating to tho&s;e enterprizes. We are by no means to cen&s;ure &s;uch a curio&s;ity in our countrymen and fellow-&s;ubjects, who&s;e &s;ituation in life will not admit of their giving much of their time to reading. It is at lea&s;t innocent; the author of the foregoing di&s;cour&s;es thinks, laudable; and &s;uch an one as ought to be encouraged rather than damped. He therefore propo&s;es in &s;ome mea&s;ure to gratify it, by this appendix. Be&s;ides; reflecting on the&s;e former un&s;ucce&s;sful expeditions, has a natural tendency to heighten our joy and gratitude on account of the la&s;t, which has been &s;o pro&s;perous. Such a contra&s;t will probably have a good effect. So that this may an&s;wer a valuable end, beyond that of merely gra|tifying the curio&s;ity of the le&s;s informed reader.</P>
<P>WERE the en&s;uing account to be prolix, it would not be adapted to the circum&s;tances of tho&s;e, for whom it is princi|pally de&s;igned. It will therefore con&s;i&s;t chiefly of a narra|tion of facts, and &s;ome material circum&s;tances. The&s;e will be mo&s;tly collected from Sir H. Walker's <HI>Journal,</HI> and the <HI>Ap|pendix</HI> thereto; Campbell's <HI>Lives of the Admirals,</HI> and Mather's <HI>Life</HI> of Sir W. Phips; which I here mention once for all. But when the expre&s;&s;ions of either of tho&s;e writers are u&s;ed, notice will be given by the u&s;ual &s;ign of a quotation. How|ever, this account, tho' &s;hort, will contain &s;ome brief hints and ob&s;ervations re&s;pecting the cau&s;es of our mi&s;carriages and di&s;a&s;ters, in the two former attempts again&s;t Canada.</P>
<P>BUT it will not be ami&s;s, before we proceed to the account propo&s;ed, ju&s;t to ob&s;erve that Quebec was long ago reduced by the Engli&s;h; becau&s;e this will furni&s;h us with an ob&s;erva|tion or two, very pertinent by way of introduction; as tend|ing to lay open, both the motives of the French in giving us &s;uch frequent di&s;turbances from that quarter, and the great
<PB REF="008417_0068_102F2A304DBFBAC8">
rea&s;on we have had on our &s;ide, repeatedly to attempt the re|duction of that place.</P>
<P>QUEBEC was reduced 130 years &s;ince, in the reign of K. Charles I. viz. A. D. 1629, by admiral Kirk or Kertk, with a fleet from England. But it was &s;oon after delivered up to France again in pur&s;uance of a treaty, viz. 1632. And as it did not fall directly within the de&s;ign of this appendix to &s;peak at all of this expedition, it is pa&s;&s;ed over with a bare mention of the&s;e facts; which are taken notice of chiefly with a view to the following ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>FATHER Charlevoix, the noted French Je&s;uit and hi&s;torian, tells us, that tho' the French court was much &s;hocked and offended at the Engli&s;h for taking Quebec; yet, excepting rea&s;ons which touch'd their honor, there were many who doubted whether they had &s;u&s;tained any real lo&s;s thereby; and whether it were expedient to demand the re&s;titution of it.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">&mdash;<Q>Mais les rai&s;ons d' honneur &aacute; part, bien de gens douterent &s;i l'on avoit fait une v&eacute;ritable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, &amp; &s;i'l &aacute; propos de deman|der la re&s;titution de Quebec.</Q></NOTE> It &s;eems, according to this hi&s;torian, that there was a great divi&s;ion in the Court of France upon this point. It was warmly debated; and many rea&s;ons were a&s;&s;igned by &s;ome, why the re&s;titution of Quebec &s;hould not be in&s;i&s;ted on. The&s;e rea&s;ons, or objections, were particularly an&s;wered by tho&s;e on the other &s;ide of the que&s;tion, who finally prevailed. By the latter it was &s;aid, among&s;t other things, that the climate of New France would grow milder by degrees as the country was more and more opened: That this could hardly be doubt|ed, &s;ince it was &s;ituated under the &s;ame parallels with the mo&s;t temperate countries of Europe: That the climate was healthy, the &s;oil fertile: That with a little labour the inhabitants might procure all the conveniences of life: That France might every year &s;end a &s;mall number of families, &s;ome &s;oldiers, with &s;ome young women that could well be &s;par'd, for breeders, and di&s;po&s;e of them in Canada, in &s;uch a manner that they might <HI>extend them&s;elves in proportion as they multiplied:</HI> That this would be an excellent nur&s;ery for &s;eamen: That the peltry, or furr-trade, would al&s;o be of con&s;iderable advantage: That for &s;hip-building, the fore&s;ts of Canada would furni&s;h them with an ample &s;upply, being, as they &s;aid, without contradicton, the fine&s;t in the univer&s;e: And la&s;tly, That only the motive of keeping the Engli&s;h from <HI>making them|&s;elves too powerful</HI> in this part of America, by joining both &s;ides of the river St. Lawrence to &s;o many other provinces, where they were already well e&s;tabli&s;hed, <HI>was more than
<PB REF="008417_0069_102F2A337B44CA60">
&s;ufficient to induce them to make a point of recovering Quebec, whatever it co&s;t them.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>En&s;in, que le &s;eul motif d'empecher les Anglois de &s;e rendre trop pui&s;&s;ans dans cette partie de l'Am&eacute;rique, en joign|nant les deux bords du Fleuve S.

<P>IT is not to be wonder'd at, that the&s;e rea&s;ons prevailed in the court of France. It were needle&s;s to ob&s;erve how punc|tually the French have regarded them ever &s;ince; particular|ly in <HI>&s;ending over a number of families and &s;ome &s;oldiers every year, with &s;ome women,</HI> that they might <HI>extend them&s;elves</HI> gra|dually as they <HI>encrea&s;ed;</HI> or, in other words, make encroach|ments upon us; and, in conjunction with the &s;avages, <HI>keep us from becoming too powerful in North America.</HI> At the &s;ame time, the&s;e things, and the French acting all along upon the&s;e maxims, without any regard to ju&s;tice, humanity or honor, equally &s;how that our repreated &s;truggles and efforts to re|take Quebec, tho' not by way of <HI>treaty,</HI> as they did, and as they have <HI>taken</HI> many other places fir&s;t and la&s;t, but by force of arms, were not without &s;ufficient grounds. Whether the &s;ame rea&s;ons will, or will not, hold equally good for maintaining Quebec to the la&s;t, or <HI>at any rate whatever</HI> with|in the bounds of ju&s;tice, belongs not to us to determine.&mdash; There are others who know far better, what <HI>can,</HI> and what is <HI>fit</HI> to be done, than we can pretend to; in who&s;e wi&s;dom, integrity and patrioti&s;m, we may &s;afely confide, as it is our duty to do.</P>
<P>I FEAR I have been too long in this introductory part of the appendix: But the be&s;t apology that can be made, is to proceed directly to the propo&s;ed narrative.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t of the two former expeditions again&s;t Quebec and Canada, of which &s;ome account was to be given, was in the reign of K. William III. &s;ixty-nine years ago, viz. A. D. 1690. No Briti&s;h troops were employed therein. But the people of New-England, having been continually mole&s;ted by the Canadians, and the Indians in their in|tere&s;t; and having been very &s;ucce&s;sful this &s;ame year in reducing Port-Royal, now Annapolis, with all Nova-Scotia, re&s;olved on this more important and arduous en|terprize
<PB REF="008417_0070_102F2A351FC70E38">
again&s;t Quebec. For it was then, and indeed long before, plainly &s;een, that we were never to expect any peace or quiet in the&s;e northern Briti&s;h colonies, while Quebec was in the hands of &s;uch neighbours as the French. Sir William Phips, the next Year Governor of the Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, was a lover of his native country, and of an active genius. He was accordingly a zealous pro|moter of this expedition, and was put at the head of it, as commander in chief.</P>
<P>IN this expedition there &s;ailed from the port of Bo&s;ton, thirty-two frigates and tran&s;ports, having on board, be&s;ides &s;eamen, about 2000 New-England troops. The large&s;t &s;hip, or admiral, carried 44 guns. The &s;ea&s;on was far too much advanced before the fleet took its departure from Bo&s;|ton, which was not till the 9th of Augu&s;t. It did not ar|rive before Quebec till the 5th of October. A 1000 Engli&s;h provincial troops, with 1500 Indians, were to have marched about the &s;ame time from Albany, and to have proceeded by the way of lake Champlain, in order to attack Montreal, or at lea&s;t to divide the French forces, and make a diver&s;ion that way, in favour of the fleet and army up the river St. Lawrence; and thereby facilitate the de&s;ign of reducing Quebec, which was the grand point in view. But, for cer|tain rea&s;ons which cannot here be particularly mentioned, the forces did not proceed at the we&s;tward, according to the original plan. Which, in part, occa&s;ioned the &s;ub&s;equent mi&s;carriage of the expedition up the river: I &s;ay in part; for there were other cau&s;es concurring; particularly &s;ickne&s;s among&s;t the troops there, and, po&s;&s;ibly, want of &s;ufficient ex|perience in the officers for &s;uch an undertaking; to the &s;ucce&s;s whereof, bravery was not the only thing nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>October 6th, Sir William &s;ummoned the French gover|nor, count Frontenac, to &s;urrender; from whom he received the following an&s;wer, <Q>That Sir William Phips, and tho&s;e with him, were traitors to their King,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">James II.</NOTE> and had taken up with that U&s;urper the PRINCE of ORANGE, and had made a <HI>revolution,</HI> which if it had not been made, <HI>N. Eng|land and the French</HI> would have been ALL ONE; and that no other an&s;wer was to be expected from him, but what &s;hould be from the mouth of his cannon.</Q> [Magnal.] The winds continued &s;o high and boi&s;terous, that it was impracti|cable for the army to land before the 8th, when all the ef|fective men, being about 1400, were landed under the com|mand of lieut. general Walley, about 5 miles below the city,
<PB REF="008417_0071_102F2A36AE9A6B80">
on the north &s;ide of the river. They had that day &s;ome &s;kir|mi&s;hes with the enemy; a few being killed on both &s;ides. They advanced &s;ome way towards the city; but the cold was now &s;o &s;evere, that the feet and hands of many were fro|zen; and others were taken &s;ick with the Small-Pox. Be|&s;ides: the enemy having &s;ea&s;onably learnt, a con&s;iderable time before, that they were in no danger of having any di&s;|turbance towards Montreal, our army that way having re|turned, drew all their &s;trength from tho&s;e parts; regular troops, Canadians and Indians; and in &s;hort made them&s;elves much &s;uperior in the field. The&s;e were &s;ufficient rea&s;ons for not advancing farther towards the city, in order to a&s;&s;ault, or be&s;iege it; and the troops were &s;oon re-imbarked. Sir William, however, in the mean time, had brought &s;ome of the &s;hips up to bombard the city; and had his own &s;hip &s;hot thro' in near 100 places. A French writer, Baron LaHonton, then at Quebec, makes him&s;elf very merry with this bombard|ment; telling his reader, that hereby the place &s;uffered da|mage to the amount of about "5 or 6 pi&s;toles." He is al&s;o very &s;evere on the conduct of Sir William. He &s;ays, "he could not have done le&s;s than he did, if the French had hired him to &s;tand &s;till with his hands in his pockets." This is doubtle&s;s an injurious reflection on him. For con&s;idering the bad weather, the cold, the &s;ickne&s;s, the &s;mallne&s;s of his force, the failing of the intended diver&s;ion at the we&s;tward, and the con&s;equent &s;trength of the enemy at Quebec, it was hardly po&s;&s;ible to have done more than he did; tho' that was indeed but very little to the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>IT was Sir William's de&s;ign, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e di&s;|couragements, afterwards to have landed the troops in the face of the city, under cover of his cannon, and to have taken it by &s;torm; the troops, as well as him&s;elf, being &s;till full of &s;pirit and re&s;olution. But &s;oon after, <Q>a violent &s;torm aro&s;e that &s;eperated the fleet, and the &s;now and the cold became &s;o extreme, that they could not continue in tho&s;e quarters any longer.</Q> And it was probably well for them, all circum&s;tances being con&s;idered, that they did not attempt to put this latter de&s;ign into execution; the enemy being at lea&s;t 3 or 4,000, and perhaps 5 or 6,000 &s;trong.</P>
<P>To &s;ay that the &s;ame number of veteran troops, under an experienced commander, and other regularly bred officers, could not have done more under the &s;ame circum&s;tances, is much more than I pre&s;ume to do. But yet it can hardly be
<PB REF="008417_0072_102F2A39E0AF4B58">
&s;uppo&s;ed po&s;&s;ible, even for &s;uch to have reduced the city, un|der all tho&s;e di&s;advantageous circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>THUS ended this expedition, with the lo&s;s of about 1000 men in the whole, and &s;everal tran&s;ports in their return from Quebec: An expedition, certainly ill-timed, being under|taken &s;o late in the year. And hereby was incurred an heavy charge to this government; which gave ri&s;e to the fir&s;t emi&s;&s;ion of a paper currency among us; a mo&s;t pernicious &s;cheme, the bad effects of which we have not got over to this day; the fortunes of many, and perhaps the morals of more, having been ruined by it.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, we ought to &s;peak with honor of Sir William Phips. Tho' neither his education, nor his ex|perience afterwards, and po&s;&s;ibly not his genius, qualified him either for the profounde&s;t policy, or for a great military command, he was a brave, hone&s;t man, of an enterpri&s;ing turn, a lover of his country, and zealous for its honor and &s;ervice; qualities which certainly make his character and memory re&s;pectable. And here, at the clo&s;e of this brief account of his unfortunate expedition, it will not be ami&s;s to &s;peak of one circum&s;tance to his honor, told in the <HI>Lives of the Admirals</HI> before mentioned, tho' relating to quite another Affair. Sir William, then only captain Phips, had, by the interce&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;topher Duke of Albermarle, obtained a &s;hip of King Charles II. in order to fi&s;h on a rich Spani&s;h wreck on the coa&s;t of Hi&s;paniola. He went, and returned without making the de&s;ir'd di&s;co|very; a con&s;iderable proportion of the profits ari&s;ing from which, was to have gone into the King's coffers, for the expence he had been at in fitting out the &s;hip. Captain Phips being again fitted out by private adventurers on the &s;ame de&s;ign, made the di&s;covery; and returned to England with &pound;. 300,000 Sterl. in &s;ilver. "On his arrival, there wanted not &s;ome, who would have per&s;uaded the King to &s;eize his &s;hip and cargo, under the pretence that captain Phips had not given an exact information, when he ap|plied for licence, and the royal a&s;&s;i&s;tance: but his Maje&s;ty generou&s;ly an&s;wered, that he knew the captain to be an hone&s;t man, and a man of honour; and that if he had brought home twice as much trea&s;ure, his proprietors &s;hould divide it. His Maje&s;ty farther expre&s;&s;ed his &s;atisfaction by knighting him." <HI>Lives of the Admirals,</HI> vol. 2. p. 376.</P>
<P><PB REF="008417_0073_102F2743F74696C8">THE other former, and much greater expedition again&s;t Quebec and Canada, was in the reign of Queen Ann, twenty one years after the above mentioned, viz. A. D. 1711. The late Lord Vi&s;count Bolinbroke, then only Mr. St. John, &s;ecretary of &s;tate to the Queen, appears to have had the chief hand in planning and directing this expedition. There were &s;ent from England either 11 or 12 line of battle &s;hips, (for accounts differ) 1 frigate, 2 bombs with their tender, and 32 tran&s;ports with &s;everal regiments, making in all upwards of 5000 men; as al&s;o 8 tran&s;ports and tenders be|longing to the train of artillery. Sir Hovenden Walker was the admiral of the fleet, and general Hill commander in chief of the Briti&s;h troops. It &s;eems they were delayed &s;ome time in the channel of England by contrary winds; which Mr. &s;ecretary St. John, in his letters then written to the admiral, expre&s;&s;es the greate&s;t concern and unea&s;i|ne&s;s. After being put back &s;everal times, from the 28th of April to the 5th of May, the fleet at length proceeded from Plymouth, and continuing its voyage, arrived at Bo&s;ton June 24th, without any material di&s;a&s;ter; when the troops were debarked, and encamped for &s;ome time on Noddle's i&s;land. To the&s;e were joined two regiments from the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, Rhode-I&s;land and New-Hamp&s;hire; all which were de&s;tin'd again&s;t Quebec and Canada, by the way of St. Lawrence.</P>
<P>GENERAL Nichol&s;on was at the &s;ame time to take under his command a body of militia from Connecticut, New-York and the Jer&s;ies, together with the Indians of the five, alias &s;ix nations, which we commonly, tho' not quite properly, blend all together under the general name of Mohawks. This army under the la&s;t mentioned general, was to proceed by the way of Lake Champlain, in order to attack Montreal, or at lea&s;t to make a diver&s;ion in tho&s;e parts; and by keeping the enemy at bay there, to forward the reduction of Quebec by the fleet and principal army. With this view they proceeded from Albany towards the lake; tho' not till the 20th of Augu&s;t. Of what number this army con&s;i&s;ted, I have either never exactly learnt, or have forgotten; probably about 3000 including Indians. This army we now leave in its progre&s;s towards the lake, and return to the other army and the fleet.</P>
<P>IT is &s;aid by &s;ome, that the&s;e were delayed at Bo&s;ton a long time for want of nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ions, &s;ome &s;eamen, &amp;c.
<PB REF="008417_0074_102F2A401B5FD000">
and this thro' the negligence, or rather the mercenary and wicked de&s;igns of certain per&s;ons here, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was to forward them with all po&s;&s;ible expedition. The admiral and general, to be &s;ure, were loud in their com|plaints, not again&s;t particular per&s;ons only, but the govern|ment in general. For the former, in one of his letters to governor Dudley, then in the chair, expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in the following terms: "I concur, &s;ays he, with the opinion of all the &s;ea and land officers here, that the <HI>government</HI> of this colony have prejudiced the pre&s;ent expedition, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;ting it." And &s;uch repre&s;entations were &s;ent home, of this matter, as left, for &s;ome time, impre&s;&s;ions on the minds of many per&s;ons there, much to the prejudice and di&s;advantage of this government. As to the negligence, ill de&s;igns, or ill conduct of &s;ome particular per&s;ons; thus far the accu&s;ation might po&s;&s;ibly be ju&s;t; which, however, I do not a&s;&s;ert. But the imputation, as it re&s;pected the go|vernment, and people in general, was doubtle&s;s a very unworthy one, to &s;ay nothing wor&s;e of it. No government could well be more zealous in promoting any expedition; all the people in general had the &s;ucce&s;s of it greatly at heart: and it may be added, that as much was done by the government to promote it, as could well be done, con&s;idering their circum&s;tances, and that they had little or no previous warning to make the needful preparations. A great genius, Jer. Dummer, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> while agent for this province at the court of London, in his excellent defence of our charter, long &s;ince did the government and province ju&s;tice; and wiped off the&s;e foul and ba&s;e a&s;per&s;ions, by &s;etting this matter in a true and clear light.</P>
<P>BUT to whatever cau&s;e or cau&s;es, the delay of the fleet and army at Bo&s;ton was owing, the fact is, that they did not proceed from hence on the expedition till July the 30th; much too late for &s;uch an enterpri&s;e, at &s;uch a di&s;tance, thro' &s;uch a navigation, and in &s;uch a country as Canada. The fleet, when it took its departure from hence for the river, con&s;i&s;ted of about 68 or 70 &s;ail, having on board 6,463 troops, including the provincials. Being got into the gulph of St. Lawrence, and having taken a French prize, the people of which gave the mo&s;t di&s;couraging and formi|dable accounts po&s;&s;ible, the admiral in his journal writes thus, August 15th; from whence it will appear, not only how much he was deceived in &s;ome re&s;pects, but how much he was di&s;concerted by that means: "Having informed
<PB REF="008417_0075_102F2A4427688FE0">
my&s;elf by all means po&s;&s;ible, &s;ays he, of the nature of Canada river, both from the French and Engli&s;h, I &s;till perceive there were more difficulties to &s;urmount than could have been imagined; for the ma&s;ter of the French prize, who had made forty voyages, as he told me, in that river, out and home, a&s;&s;ured me no &s;hip ever winter'd there, but hazarded every thing, rather than let the fro&s;t overtake them. That between the mouth of the river and Quebec, being about 130 leagues, there was <HI>neither road, bay,</HI> or <HI>har|bour,</HI> where &s;hips could be in tolerable &s;ecurity; that he <HI>never found ground,</HI> tho' he tried with a line of 400 fathom; that the &s;hoar was &s;teep too all along, being exceeding high and mountainous, and in mo&s;t places you &s;hould have 100 fathom <HI>within a cable's length</HI> of the &s;hoar; in &s;ome parts as deep water, and the &s;hips &s;ides touching the rocks. That it has been impo&s;&s;ible for any per&s;on&mdash;to know the cur|rents&mdash;; that <HI>fogs</HI> and <HI>&s;torms</HI> were &s;o frequent, as they might well be e&s;teem'd <HI>continual,</HI>" &amp;c. &amp;c. But the&s;e things I leave without pretending to determine, whether this ad|miral were then the more ea&s;y believer, or the Frenchman the greater L&mdash;r.</P>
<P>ON the 18th of Augu&s;t the fleet was not far from the mouth of the river; but the wind blowing hard again&s;t them, as the admiral &s;ays, he put into the bay of Ga&s;pee, to the &s;outhward. There they were detain'd till the 20th, when they made &s;ail for the river. The night of the 23d, being thick and dark, and the advice of the Engli&s;h pilots, as they declar'd, not being follow'd by the admiral, prov'd fatal to part of the fleet, and put an end to this expedition. Being enter'd the river as far as the egg-i&s;lands on the nor|thern &s;hoar, eight tran&s;ports were there ca&s;t away, and near 1000 people peri&s;hed; among&s;t whom, however, there were none of the New-England troops. About ten days after, the fleet put into Spani&s;h river in the i&s;land of Cape-Breton. After con&s;ulting there &s;ome time, what was to be done, particularly whether any thing &s;hould be attempted again&s;t the enemy at Placentia on Newfoundland, it was at length determined in a council both of land and &s;ea officers, that it was impracticable to do any thing; except to return directly to England, after giving general Nichol&s;on, whom we left in his progre&s;s towards Montreal, advice of the di&s;a&s;ter which had befallen them: For his now going for|ward could an&s;wer no valuable end. The fleet accordingly took its departure from Spani&s;h river Sept. 16. In a &s;hort
<PB REF="008417_0076_102F2A4804266890">
pa&s;&s;age they were in &s;oundings near the Briti&s;h channel; and Oct. 16. the admiral's &s;hip then lying at anchor at Spithead, was blown up, with mo&s;t of his papers, and many people on board, the admiral him&s;elf being on &s;hore. No di&s;covery was ever made, by what means this happened. Some have thought it was not an accidental thing, but done with de&s;ign, as being the mo&s;t expeditious and &s;afe&s;t way of &s;ettling the voyage. However this &s;ugge&s;tion &s;eems hardly credible.</P>
<P>THUS ended the &s;econd, grand expedition again&s;t Cana|da; that of admiral Kirk mentioned above, not being here reckoned as one. "The charge incurred by the province of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay was &s;omething more than &pound;. 24,000 &s;terling, allowed by parliament." Doug. Summ.</P>
<P>THERE were three circum&s;tances e&s;pecially, attending this expedition, either of which might probably have proved fatal to the &s;ucce&s;s of it without the other two. In the fir&s;t place, it was much too late in the year before the fleet &s;ailed from England. In the next, &s;ea&s;onable notice had not been given here, to make preparation for its arrival, and for that part which the colonies were to bear in the enterprize. And la&s;tly, there was want of a number of throughly and &s;ufficiently experienced pilots for the river; at lea&s;t, of &s;uch as the admiral, who was doubtle&s;s a gentle|man of very good &s;en&s;e and accompli&s;hments, could place full confidence in, and rely upon; which &s;eems to have entirely di&s;concerted him. Some have hinted at deep, dark and treacherous de&s;igns, relative to this expedition. Nor is it &s;trange that there &s;hould have been &s;ome &s;u&s;picions of this &s;ort, con&s;idering who were then at the helm, and how &s;ome other matters were carried on about that time. But that there was really any treachery in the ca&s;e, is by no means clear, or certain; and perhaps, upon laying all things together, very improbable. However, it is quite beyond the de&s;ign of this appendix, to make any &s;ort of inquiry into that matter; which, to be &s;ure, would be of no advantage to tho&s;e, who&s;e gratification was propo&s;ed hereby.</P>
<P>AS the account of the&s;e two expeditions was introduced with the mention of one which preceeded them, when both Canada and New-England were in their infant &s;tate; it may be follow'd with the mention of another, which was planned &s;ince the&s;e; but without being carried into execu|tion, or &s;o much as attempted, except &s;o far as the enli&s;ting of troops here for that end. This was during the la&s;t
<PB REF="008417_0077_102F2A49A23877B0">
war, viz. in 1746. The orders from Great Britain for making the&s;e levies, were dated in April that year. Many troops were rai&s;ed in the colonies on &s;o important an occa&s;ion; &s;ome of which were rendezvous'd at Saratoga above Albany. But at length, to our great &s;urprize and mortification, in October of the following year, orders were received here for di&s;banding the troops. Why this de&s;ign was not then pro&s;ecuted, there are others that know better than the author of the&s;e few pages.</P>
<P>BUT be thankful, my countrymen and fellow-&s;ubjects, that what all who have well under&s;tood, and heartily de&s;ired, the true intere&s;t of Briti&s;h America, ever e&s;teemed the grand, e&s;&s;ential point, is now gained. QUEBEC, after repeated &s;truggles and efforts, is at length reduced: QUE|BEC, I had almo&s;t called it that Pandora's box, from whence unnumber'd plagues have i&s;&s;ued for more than an hundred years, to di&s;tre&s;s, to enfeeble, to lay wa&s;te, the&s;e northern colonies; and which might, perhaps, in the end have proved fatal to them! An acqui&s;ition, the con&s;equence of which, <HI>if maintained,</HI> mu&s;t prove, not only the utter ruin of the French power and intere&s;t in America; but in time, accord|ing to the natural cour&s;e of things, the exalting of the&s;e little provinces and colonies, as it were into as many king|doms; and con&s;equently, the rai&s;ing of the Briti&s;h empire in Europe, on which they will continue dependent, to an height and dignity among&s;t the nations, which it never knew before. However, altho' this is not a <HI>&s;ermon,</HI> it may be ju&s;t added here, that under the government and pro|vidence of God, all this will depend, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, on our own wi&s;dom, virtue and piety: For even our pro&s;perity, without the&s;e qualities, may prove our ruin. A pagan &s;aid wi&s;ely, whether ju&s;tly or not, as applied to ancient Rome,
<Q><L>"Diis te minorem quod geris, imperas:</L>
<L>"Hinc omne principium, huc refer exitum"!</L></Q>
Which being put into a more chri&s;tian &s;tile, in plain pro&s;e, may be expre&s;&s;ed thus: You are exalted above other nations, becau&s;e you are virtuous, and <HI>walk humbly with your God:</HI> From hence deduce the origin of your power, its increa&s;e and grandeur; and to the contrary a&s;cribe its fall!&mdash;Or you may take the &s;um of it in the words of a <HI>certain wi&s;e King,</HI> who flouri&s;hed in the days of old: "Righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a nation, but &s;in is a reproach to any people."</P>
<P>TO conclude: However unfortunate the former expedi|tions again&s;t Canada were, in the reigns of K. William and
<PB REF="008417_0078_102F2A4B3B2C0E58">
Q. Ann, e&s;pecially the latter, wherein the fleet met with &s;uch difficulties and di&s;a&s;ters; the la&s;t of all has been at|tended with &s;uch pro&s;perity, as will gloriou&s;ly di&s;tingui&s;h the reign of K. GEORGE II. In the &s;ucce&s;s of who&s;e fleets and arms the elements &s;eem now to intere&s;t them&s;elves, for bringing down the pride of France.</P>
