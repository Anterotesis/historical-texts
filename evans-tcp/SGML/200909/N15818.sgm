<HEAD>AN ADDRESS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Beloved Brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>REASON taught the old Romans, the inju&s;tice of condemning any man before he had his accu&s;ers face to face, with licence to an&s;wer for him&s;elf; and revelation &s;aith to Chri&s;tians, <HI>In the mouth of two or three witne&s;&s;es &s;hall every word be e&s;tabli&s;hed.</HI> 2. COR. xiii. 1. And upon per&s;onal offences, our Lord requires us to give each brother two opportunities to &s;peak for him&s;elf, before he is arraigned before the church; and then &s;ays, <HI>If he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen Man and a Publican.</HI> And he a&s;&s;ures us that none have a right to be in his church, who are not be|come as <HI>little children.</HI> MAT. xviii. 3, 15, 18. And what holine&s;s would &s;oon prevail in his church, if his laws were obeyed therein! <HI>Lord&s;hip</HI> is of the <HI>Gentiles;</HI> and by them hath the <HI>Holy City,</HI> been long troden under foot. MARK x. 15, 42. REV. xi. 2. The church hath been labouring, like a traveling woman, for de|liverance from Antichri&s;tian Tyranny; and this labour hath now come to a point among our churches, as the following facts will &s;hew.</P>
<P>THE Warren a&s;&s;ociation was formed as a friendly conference, without claiming any juri&s;diction over the churches. In September, 1772, they elected me their Agent, to u&s;e my be&s;t endeavours, by the advice of their committee, to obtain the e&s;tabli&s;hment of equal
<PB N="4" REF="020213_0003_0FAE4874A0040798">religious liberty in this country: And for that end we publi&s;hed the&s;e five rea&s;ons, in 1773, again&s;t comply|ing any longer with the certificate laws of the ruling party in New-England, 1&s;t. Becau&s;e it implies an ac|knowledgment, that civil rulers have a right to &s;et one religiou&s; &s;ect above another, which they have not. 2d. Becau&s;e they are not our repre&s;entatives in religious affairs, and therefore have no right to impo&s;e religious taxes. 3d. Becau&s;e their doing it emboldens the ruling party, to a&s;&s;ume God's prerogative, &s;o as to judge the hearts of all who put not into their mouths. 4th. Be|cau&s;e the church is pre&s;ented as a cha&s;te virgin to Chri&s;t; and the placeing of her tru&s;t and love upon any others for temporal &s;upport, is <HI>playing the harlot,</HI> and &s;o the way to de&s;troy all religion. HOSEA ii. 5. 5th. Becau&s;e this practice tends to promote envy, hypocri&s;y, and confu&s;ion, and &s;o to the ruin of civil &s;ociety,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>My Hi&s;tory,</HI> vol. 2. p. 278.</NOTE> But Mr. Ebenezer Hinds di&s;liked our drop|ping that practice; and he was &s;o much offended with the language of our memorial again&s;t it, to our legi&s;la|ture in 1775, that he did not attend our a&s;&s;ociation again in &s;even years. He wrote to them in 1779, to reprove them for continuing me as their Agent: To which they returned a re&s;pectful an&s;wer. He wrote again in like manner, in 1780, when they made him no reply. In September 1781, Mo&s;es Thomas went to the a&s;&s;ociation with a complaint again&s;t elder Hunt's church, becau&s;e they had excommunicated him the winter before. This the a&s;&s;ociation took &s;o much notice of, as to publi&s;h a Note in their Minutes, that they claimed no juri&s;diction in points of di&s;cipline; but recommended it to neighbouring churches, that if they were properly applied to, they would afford &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;|tance as was in their power. Thus matters lay for above eight months, and then three churches were ap|plied to, for a&s;&s;i&s;tance in council upon his ca&s;e, on June
<PB N="5" REF="020213_0004_0FAE4876025B60D8">11, 1782; the time when I was obliged, by an ap|pointment in &s;aid Minutes, to be in the county of Albany.</P>
<P>OUR church &s;ent deacon Alden, and two more delegates to that council; and elder Hunt's church cho&s;e a committee to attend upon them, and to give them what light they could in the affair: Each of the committee were nominated, and then were cho&s;en by the church, by lifting up of hands; until elder Hunt was nominated and &s;econded, without any objection, and he concluded it &s;ufficient, without putting his own choice to a formal vote. Yet becau&s;e that formality was omitted, elder Hinds was &s;o earne&s;t to prevent his having liberty to &s;peak before the council, that he ac|cu&s;ed him of injuring the truth, for &s;aying he was one of that committee. However, two thirds of the coun|cil obtained &s;atisfaction that &s;aid excommunication was ju&s;t. But Hinds was &s;o unea&s;y about it, that he car|ried a long paper of accu&s;ations again&s;t Hunt to your church; and Alden brought another to ours; but I refu&s;ed to read it to our church. In September 1782, elder Hinds went again to our a&s;&s;ociation, to whom another complaint was carried from Mo&s;es Thomas, but the moderator did not think proper to read it pub|lickly. Hinds continued &s;o unea&s;y with Hunt, as to write a letter to the a&s;&s;ociation again&s;t him, in Septem|ber 1783; but it was not read to them. After which I procured a meeting at Ebenezer Nel&s;on's; on January 13, 1784, when Hunt gave Hinds &s;uch &s;atisfaction up|on all the points that he complained of, that the con|trover&s;y &s;eemed to be &s;ettled betwixt them; until in the evening Hinds again brought up his accu&s;ation again&s;t Hunt, of his injuring the truth, in &s;aying he was of that committee. Upon which I aro&s;e, and &s;aid, <Q>I &s;olemnly warn you again&s;t going on in this way, you will ruin your&s;elf.</Q> In March following, he came to my hou&s;e, and told me, he would not take the warning at my hands. On April 26, I wrote to him, and reminded him of the divine rules in MAT. xviii. 4.
<PB N="6" REF="020213_0005_0FAE487669949B88">LUKE xxii. 26, and then &s;aid, <Q>It appeared to my con&s;cience, that you indulged a &s;everity towards brother Hunt, that you would not receive as right towards you, from any man in the world.</Q> To this he wrote an an&s;wer on May 1, wherein, after trying to ju&s;tify his &s;everity, he &s;aid, <Q>Pray my good friend; don't let that or any other man &s;eparate us, as MARK did greater and better men than we.</Q> To this I re|plied on May 31, and &s;aid, "I am very certain that our chief danger does not lie in that place. It is ex|actly here, You have from time to time laid com|plaints before me again&s;t your brethren, for which you have broken fellow&s;hip with them, and, in the ca&s;e in hand, with an elder, &s;o as to refu&s;e to hear him preach, without ever allowing me a hearing thereof in a go&s;|pel way." This he denied, and wrote to our church for a hearing upon it; and they granted it, on Augu&s;t 11, 1784. But then he refu&s;ed to &s;tate or &s;upport any charge again&s;t me, and in&s;i&s;ted upon my proving the truth of what I had writen, nine miles from my wit|ne&s;&s;es. This appeared &s;o unrea&s;onable, that our church di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the ca&s;e, to be &s;ettled betwixt our&s;elves, and Hinds went off; upon which deacon Alden aro&s;e, and railed at our church, at a high rate, and his holding with Hinds in that line of conduct hath moved him to for&s;ake our meeting for above three years pa&s;t.</P>
<P>Elder Hinds made three attempts more to croud that ca&s;e into our church, without letting me know what it was that he denied in my letter; but not being able to do it, he was forced to grant me a hearing in your church, April 29, 1785; when he owned that he had from time to time informed me of actions that he was offended with in his brethren, and who were cen|&s;ured therefor; but he &s;aid my words meant that he had done it before they were cen&s;ured, and that his doing it was the cau&s;e of their cen&s;ure; a meaning which I never thought of till that day. On May 4, 1785, I wrote a plain &s;tate of the&s;e facts to your church, and then &s;aid, "the main &s;upport of Antichri&s;t, from his fir&s;t
<PB N="7" REF="020213_0006_0FAE4877226CA710">ri&s;e to this day, has been by teachers accounting them|&s;elves &s;o much greater than the churches, as to unite all their influence again&s;t di&s;&s;enters from their judgments, and then calling in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">ular arm to &s;upport them, and to enforce all their mea&s;ures." And I informed you, that as elder Hinds had openly broken fellow|&s;hip with me, you mu&s;t not expect that I &s;hould join with him again, until he explicitly renounced tho&s;e evils. This he hath never done; but in general terms he deni|ed that he held them, before our mutual council of Nov. 16, 178<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">, and then denied the truth of facts, in four particulars, without giving a fair opportunity for &s;upporting them by evidence, by which means the council &s;aid in their re&s;ult, that the crimes I had charged him with were not &s;ufficiently proved to them. At the &s;ame time they fully ju&s;tified the re&s;ult of the council of March 15, 1785, in their condemning your cen&s;ure upon brother Samuel Nel&s;on and others, becau&s;e they did not allow that Hinds's confe&s;&s;ion was equal to the offences that he was judged to be guilty of by your mutual council of Sept. 28, 1784. On May 24. 1786, I wrote to elder Hinds, and &s;tated plainly the four points wherein he denied the truth, before the council of Nov. 16, 17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">5, without giving fair opportunity to prove them, and de&s;ired that the&s;e things might be &s;ettled in a go&s;pel way. This he hath not an&s;wered; but he hath &s;ince been guilty of the followlng evils.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, He publi&s;hed a pamphlet la&s;t &s;ummer, called <HI>A Hi&s;tory of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> wherein are &s;undry things, concern|ing our former &s;eparation from the ruling &s;ect in New-England, which are directly contrary to fact.</P>
<P>Secondly, In your church meeting October 8, 1784 he declared that he was &s;orry he had reported &s;o many that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">, and promi&s;ed not to do &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> pamphlet he hath violated that promi&s;e to a high degree.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="020213_0007_0FAE4877FB221B78">
Thirdly, Though he readily went to the council cal|led by an excommunicated man, June 11, 1782, and tried to debar elder Hunt from the privilege of an&s;wer|ing for him&s;elf, after which he brought and read accu&s;a|tions again&s;t him to your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> in his ab&s;ence; yet Hinds hath now accu&s;ed me of being wor&s;e than the heathen, only becau&s;e I went to the council of June 15, 1784, called by &s;even of your aggrieved brethren, and heard &s;ome complaints again&s;t Hinds in his ab&s;ence, and then adjourned to give him opportunity for an&s;|wering thereto. p. 8, 9.</P>
<P>Fourthly, In &s;aid pamphlet he hath plainly manife&s;ted the &s;ame temper that he had, when he refu&s;ed to come to the council of March 15, 1785, at their earne&s;t re|que&s;t, to give them what light he could in ca&s;es that were to be laid before them; and now he hath accu&s;ed them with <HI>lying,</HI> without &s;o much as &s;ub&s;cribing his name to the accu&s;ation. p. 11, 12.</P>
<P>Fifthly, Though our church reque&s;ted a free confer|ence with yours upon the affairs between us, on the 11th. in&s;tant, to give and receive light as God &s;hould direct, and received a promi&s;e of that privilege; yet when we came to the meeting, and I attempted to give the rea|&s;ons why I could not retract tho&s;e former charges that I had laid again&s;t elder Hinds, he, and a party with him, po&s;itively refu&s;ed to grant me that liberty; I there|fore appeal to all your con&s;ciences, whether he ought not to be excluded from your communion until he offers go&s;pel &s;atisfaction for the foregoing offences to others, as well as to your injured brother.</P>
