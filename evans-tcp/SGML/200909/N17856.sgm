<P>See&s;t thou how Faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MANY have imagined that the apo&s;tles, Paul and James, differed in &s;entiment about ju&s;tifying faith; becau&s;e the one &s;ays, A man is ju&s;tified by faith without the deeds of the law; and the other &s;ays, By works a man is ju&s;tified, and not by faith only. But if we duly attend to the occa&s;ion and &s;cope of their writings, it will pull down all &s;uch imaginations. For Paul was called to lay the foundation of Chri&s;tianity, among nations who were &s;trangers to revelation, and to the hope of the go&s;pel; which hope is built upon the pure mercy of God, as revealed in his Son, and not upon any doings of the creature. And to fix the&s;e ideas in the mind is of infinite import|ance to every child of Adam. But after Chri&s;tian|ity had become honorable among men, many pro|fe&s;&s;ed to believe in Chri&s;t, who neglected obedience to his laws, and imagined that true faith and holy works could be &s;eparated. Therefore James was in&s;pired to write unto the twelve tribes who were &s;cattered abroad, and to call them to rejoice in the
<PB N="6" REF="023140_0005_0FBC7F9943C7ED10">divers temptations which they fell into, to try their faith and patience, in pro&s;perity or adver&s;ity, in view of the crown of life, which the Lord hath promi&s;ed to them who love him. But he warns them again&s;t ever &s;aying that God <HI>enticed</HI> any into &s;in; for all &s;in proceeds from the <HI>lu&s;ts of men.</HI> And to guard again&s;t all error, he &s;ays, Every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variablene&s;s, neither &s;hadow of turning. Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we &s;hould be a kind of fir&s;t-fruits of his creatures. James i. 1&mdash;18. So that James held to the doc|trine of the entire depravity of human nature, and to regeneration and &s;alvation by the &s;overeign grace of God, as much as Paul did. There was a &s;weet harmony between them; as will more fully appear, if we con&s;ider the nature of faith, the in|fluence of it upon human conduct, and how it is made perfect by works.</P>
<P N="1">1. What is faith? In the common affairs of life, faith is as ea&s;ily under&s;tood at any word in lan|guage; but in religion, all arts have been made u&s;e of to render it as ob&s;cure and uncertain as po&s;|&s;ible. When it re&s;pects a report or te&s;timony, faith is receiving what is reported or te&s;tified for truth; and when it relates to promi&s;es and cove|nants, it is verity and punctuality in the promifer, and tru&s;t and confidence in him or them to whom the promi&s;es are made. And an impartial and ef|fectual execution of the laws, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and obedience thereto, is the faith of government. But how little of it is now &s;een in the world. When the Son of God was manife&s;ted in the fle&s;h, his &s;ervants &s;aid, Who hath believed our report? Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing, by the word
<PB N="7" REF="023140_0006_0FBC7F9B4E5EE0F8">of God. Rom. x. 16, 17. He that hath received his te&s;timony, hath &s;et to his &s;eal, that God is true; for he whom God hath &s;ent &s;peaketh the words of God; for God giveth not the Spirit by mea&s;ure unto him. The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand. He that believeth on the Son, hath everla&s;ting life; and he that be|lieveth not the Son, &s;hall not &s;ee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him. John iii. 33&mdash;36. We are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe, to the &s;aving of the &s;oul. Now faith is the &s;ub&s;tance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not &s;een. For by it the elders obtained a good report. Through faith we under|&s;tand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, &s;o that things which are &s;een were not made of things which do appear. By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent &s;acrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witne&s;s, that he was righteous, God te&s;tifying of his gifts; and by it he being dead, yet &s;peaketh. Heb. x. 39. xi. 1&mdash;4. But Cain &s;lew his brother, becau&s;e his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous. 1 John iii. 12. And all that dwell upon the earth wor&s;hip the bea&s;t, who received his power from the devil, who&s;e names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb &s;lain from the foundation of the world. Rev. xiii. 4&mdash;8. From whence we may &s;ee the infinite importance of the obedience of faith.</P>
<P>Which leads us,</P>
<P N="2">II. To con&s;ider the influence of faith upon hu|man conduct. When God called Abraham out of Chaldea, he revealed to him, that a great nation &s;hould &s;pring from him, who &s;hould inherit the land of Canaan, out of whom &s;hould come the king Me&s;&s;iah, in whom all the families of the earth &s;hould
<PB N="8" REF="023140_0007_0FBC7F9C6D64A6B8">be ble&s;&s;ed. And Abraham believed in the Lord, and he accounted it to him for righteou&s;ne&s;s. Yet after the promi&s;ed child of Abraham was born, and had obtained a great &s;hare in his affections, God &s;aw fit to try his faith, by &s;aying, Take now thy &s;on, thine only &s;on I&s;aac, whom thou love&s;t, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the moun|tains which I &s;hall tell thee of. And Abraham was all obedience to the command, until God relea&s;ed him from the execution thereof, and &s;aid, Now know I that thou feare&s;t God, &s;eeing thou ha&s;t not withheld thy &s;on, thine only &s;on from me. Gen. xii. 3. xv. 6. xxii. 1&mdash;12. But how could Abraham believe that a great nation, and the king Me&s;&s;iah, could &s;pring from that &s;on, if he was &s;acrificed upon the altar? An&s;wer, He accounted that God was able to rai&s;e him up, even from the dead; from whence al&s;o he received him in a figure. Heb. xi. 19. See&s;t thou how faith wrought with his works. He believed that God was always to be obeyed; and that the iron gates of death could not hinder the fulfilment of his promi&s;es. God gave him that &s;on, when he and Sarah were as good as dead; therefore nothing was too hard to do, nor any fa|vour too great to expect, in the way of obedience. Fear and love were united in his &s;oul, which prin|ciples had been divided by the fall; and faith, hope and love, rai&s;ed his heavenly mind above all the ob&s;tacles that fle&s;hly rea&s;onings, or infernal temptations could ca&s;t in his way. And they who are of faith, the &s;ame are the children of Abraham, and heirs according to the promi&s;e. Gal. iii. 7, 29. The believer views all the precepts of God to be true, and therefore to be obeyed; all his promi&s;es to be true, therefore he &s;hall be &s;upported; and he
<PB N="9" REF="023140_0008_0FBC7F9DB5C66738">views eternal things as real and near, therefore to be regarded without delay. The &s;erpent deceived our mother Eve, by repre&s;enting the law of God as unrea&s;onable, and the penalty of it as fal&s;e; and by the &s;ame arts, the minds of many profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians have been <HI>corrupted</HI> from the <HI>&s;implicity</HI> that is in Chri&s;t. 2 Cor. xi. 3. By inventing a <HI>duplicity</HI> of meanings to the holy &s;criptures, men have <HI>corrupted</HI> them&s;elves more than brute bea&s;ts, who know and obey their owners. Jude 4&mdash;10. I&s;ai. i. 2, 3. Yea, they are two-fold more the chil|dren of hell than the Jews were, who were a genera|tion of vipers. Matt. xxiii. 15, 33. For the Jews have a fixed regard for the law of Mo&s;es, and for the land of Canaan, where they yet hope for an earthly kingdom; but pro&s;elytes to revelation, who are not born again, have no fixed rule of conduct, nor any country that can &s;et any bounds to their pride and love of money, which is the root of all evil. 1 Tim. vi. 3&mdash;10. But true believers under&s;tand our Lord, when he &s;ays, He that hath my com|mandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me; and he that loveth me, &s;hall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manife&s;t my|&s;elf to him. John xiv. 21. For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments; and his commandments are not grievous. 1 John v. 3. We therefore come,</P>
<P N="3">III. To con&s;ider how faith is made perfect by works. An in&s;pired apo&s;tle &s;ays, Who&s;oever is born of God, overcometh the world; and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. 1 John v. 4. As a living child, he grows in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t. 2 Peter iii .18. For the path of the ju&s;t is as the &s;hining light, that &s;hineth more
<PB N="10" REF="023140_0009_0FBC7FA0AF88EE18">and more unto the perfect day. Prov. iv. 18. They who have the knowledge of the truth, yet form many wrong conclu&s;ions therefrom, which are corrected and removed by exerci&s;e and experience. Rebekah believed that her &s;on Jacob was heir to the peculiar promi&s;e of God to their family; but her mi&s;taken apprehen&s;ions cau&s;ed her to move Ja|cob to deceive his father, in order to get the ble&s;&s;|ing; as if God needed any &s;uch methods to help him out with his promi&s;e. So far from it, that &s;he and her &s;on brought them&s;elves into great perplex|ities thereby. And when Jacob was returning from a twenty years exile, none of his inventions could help him; therefore he &s;aid, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father I&s;aac, the Lord who &s;aid&s;t unto me, Return unto thy coun|try, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee: I am not worthy of the lea&s;t of all the mer|cies, and of all the truth, which thou ha&s;t &s;hewed unto thy &s;ervant; for with my &s;taff I pa&s;&s;ed over this Jordan, and now I am become two bands. Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my bro|ther, from the hand of E&s;au; for I fear him, le&s;t he will come and &s;mite me, and the mother with the children. He pleaded the promi&s;e of God, in the way of obedience to his precepts, and in &s;o do|ing he obtained the name of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> which &s;ignifies, <HI>A prince of the &s;trong God.</HI> Gen. xxxii. 9&mdash;28. In reference to which, Je&s;us &s;aid, <HI>Behold an I&s;raelite indeed, in whom is no guile.</HI> John i. 47. And Paul &s;ays, In Je&s;us Chri&s;t neither circumci&s;ion availeth any thing, nor uncircumci&s;ion, but a <HI>new creature.</HI> And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the <HI>I&s;rael of God.</HI> Gal. vi. 15, 16. Faith carried the mind of Mo&s;es above all the allurements of Pharaoh's court, and
<PB N="11" REF="023140_0010_0FBC7FA7C28D9850">above its terrors too; though Egypt was then the riche&s;t, and the mo&s;t powerful kingdom in all the world. Yet Mo&s;es cho&s;e to &s;uffer affliction with the people of God, rather than to enjoy the plea|&s;ures of &s;in for a &s;ea&s;on; e&s;teeming the reproach of Chri&s;t greater riches than the trea&s;ures in Egypt; for he had re&s;pect unto the recompence of the re|ward. By faith he for&s;ook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured as &s;eeing him who is invi&s;ible. Through faith he kept the pa&s;&s;|over, and the &s;prinkling of blood, le&s;t he that de|&s;troyed the fir&s;tborn, &s;hould touch them. Heb. xi. 24&mdash;28. Thus by works is faith made perfect. The believer <HI>grows</HI> up to the &s;tature of a <HI>perfect</HI> man in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. Eph. iv. 13. Even &s;o as to put away <HI>childi&s;h things.</HI> 1 Cor. xiii. 10, 11. Al&s;o by works the perfection of faith is <HI>made manife&s;t.</HI> For Peter &s;aid, Let all the hou&s;e of I&s;rael know a&s;&s;uredly, that God hath <HI>made</HI> that &s;ame Je&s;us whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Chri&s;t. Acts ii. 36. That is, He hath <HI>declared</HI> him to be the Son of God with power. Rom. i. 4. True faith is a growing principle, and by its exerci&s;e the perfec|tion of it is made known, and believers let their light &s;hine before men, that they may &s;ee their good works, and glorify their heavenly Father. Matt. v. 16. And though all evildoers hate the light, yet they will be con&s;trained to glorify God in the day of vi&s;itation. 1 Peter ii. 12. And this view of the obedience of faith may teach us many le&s;&s;ons of great importance.</P>
<P N="1">1. It may teach us the unrea&s;onablene&s;s of all the objections of men, again&s;t the doctrine of &s;ov|ereign grace in Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Many have repre|&s;ented, that the belief of free and certain &s;alvation in him, makes men carele&s;s about their conduct in
<PB N="12" REF="023140_0011_0FBC7FAC00E9AC50">the world, and very injurious to true morality. Yea, not a few have &s;aid, "If I believed that doc|trine, I would gratify my lu&s;ts as much as I plea&s;ed; and if I believed that my good works could not procure the fayour of God, and eternal life, I would not do them." But &s;uch language may well remind us of the words of Solomon, who &s;ays, When he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wi&s;dom faileth him, and he &s;aith to every one that he is a fool. Eccl. x. 3. For &s;uch men &s;hew plainly, that they love them&s;elves above God and their neighbours; and that the only re&s;traint upon their lu&s;ts is fear of puni&s;hment, or &s;ome other &s;elfi&s;h end. And therefore, under high pretences to <HI>rea|&s;on,</HI> they often deal with <HI>revelation,</HI> as crafty poli|ticians do with bills which are propo&s;ed for laws; namely, to endeavour to &s;py faults therein, and propo&s;e amendments, in order that &s;uch laws may be rejected at la&s;t. But before men even venture to <HI>&s;peak evil of the things which they know not,</HI> let them rea&s;on about things which they do know, according to the above principles. Let one of them come out and &s;ay, "I have a very loving and faithful wife; and I keep her &s;o by often threatening to divorce or for&s;ake her; and I have no way to keep her in good order, but by ever holding her in <HI>&s;u&s;pen&s;e</HI> about my un&s;haken love to her. I have al&s;o a family of obedient children, and they are kept &s;o by <HI>terror,</HI> and by always hold|ing them in <HI>doubt</HI> about ever enjoying my inheri|tance." If men could not deceive others about their &s;ouls, any more than &s;uch rea&s;onings would do about their bodies and families, they could not &s;ubvert whole hou&s;es, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's &s;ake, as many do. Ti|tus i. 10, 11. God &s;aid, Two &s;hall be one fle&s;h;
<PB N="13" REF="023140_0012_0FBC7FAD78CBAC40">but he that is joined unto the Lord is one &s;pirit. 1 Cor. vi. 16, 17. And the believer &s;ays to Chri&s;t, Set me as a &s;eal upon thine heart, as a &s;eal upon thine arm; for love is &s;trong as death, jealou&s;y is cruel as the grave. Cant. viii. 6.&mdash; How cruel then are all teachers, who repre&s;ent a&s;&s;urance of the eternal love of God to the &s;oul, as that which would make it carele&s;s about obe|dience to him! God &s;ays, I have made a covenant with my cho&s;en, I have &s;worn unto David my &s;ervant.&mdash;If his children for&s;ake my law, and walk not in my judgments; if they break my &s;ta|tutes, and keep not my commandments; then will I vi&s;it their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion with the rod, and their iniquity with &s;tripes; neverthele&s;s, my loving kind|ne&s;s will I not utterly take from him, nor &s;uffer my faithfulne&s;s to fail; my covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. P&s;alm lxxxix. 3, 30&mdash;34. Beloved, now are we the &s;ons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we &s;hall be; but we know, that when he &s;hall ap|pear, we &s;hall be like him; for we &s;hall &s;ee him as he is. And every man that hath this hope in him, purifieth him&s;elf, even as he is pure. 1 John iii. 2, 3. Therefore all men who imagine that a&s;|&s;urance of our being the children of God, and heirs of eternal life, is injurious to the cau&s;e of holine&s;s, or of human happine&s;s, have not that exerci&s;e of faith which he requires. And this may teach us,</P>
<P N="2">2. The rea&s;on why all &s;in is included in unbe|lief. For our Lord &s;ays, Every one that doth evil, hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, le&s;t his deeds &s;hould be reproved. But he that doth truth, cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manife&s;t, that they are wrought in God. The Comforter will reprove the world of &s;in, and of
<PB N="14" REF="023140_0013_0FBC7FAEF9487590">righteou&s;ne&s;s, and of judgment: of &s;in, becau&s;e they believe not on me. John iii. 20, 21. xvi. 7&mdash;9. Jews and Gentiles are all under &s;in. God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all. Rom. iii. 9. xi. 32. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female; for ye are all one in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; and if ye be Chri&s;t's, then are ye Abraham's &s;eed, and heirs according to the promi&s;e. Gal. iii. 28, 29. The covenant of circumci&s;ion made a great difference between Jews and Greeks, bond and free, males and females; but the Go&s;pel removes all the&s;e di&s;tinctions, and opens a door for each &s;inner to come to God through his Son; and all who do &s;o are equally <HI>heirs of promi&s;e.</HI> Heb. vi. 17, 18. But the main of the natural children of Abraham, loved their lands, their oxen, and their wives, above the Son of God, and his Go&s;pel fea&s;t; and therefore he &s;aid, None of tho&s;e men which were bidden, &s;hall ta&s;te of my &s;upper.&mdash;So likewi&s;e, who&s;oever he be of you, that for&s;aketh not all that he hath, <HI>he cannot be my di&s;|ciple.</HI> Luke xiv. 15&mdash;27, 33. But men have been &s;o far from believing this truth, that multitudes have imagined that they were made di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, and heirs of the promi&s;es of the Go&s;pel, without their own knowledge or choice. And they do not now believe, that intemperance will bite like a &s;erpent, and &s;ting like an adder; nor that uncleanne&s;s is like lying down in the ocean, or upon the top of a ma&s;t. No, nor that the getting of trea&s;ures by a lying tongue, is a vanity to&s;&s;ed to and fro of them who &s;eek death. Prov. xxi. 6. xxiii. 31&mdash;35. In&s;tead of believing the word of truth, they bend their tongues like their bow for lies; but they are not valiant for the truth upon
<PB N="15" REF="023140_0014_0FBC7FB4F533DF80">the earth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, &s;aith the Lord.&mdash;They have taught their tongue to &s;peak lies, and weary them|&s;elves to commit iniquity. Jer. ix. 3, 5. Much u&s;e is made of the maxim, "Of two evils chu&s;e the lea&s;t;" but how is it applied? There is the evil of <HI>&s;in,</HI> and the evil of <HI>affliction;</HI> the one is a|gain&s;t God; the other affects &s;elf; and how often does &s;elf prevail? Wealth, health, and friend&s;hip, are the deare&s;t things in this world. Job &s;pake well of God under the mo&s;t &s;urprizing lo&s;s of the two former of the&s;e; but when friend&s;hip failed him, and rather increa&s;ed his &s;orrows, he cur&s;ed the day of his birth. And after he had wearied him&s;elf and others, in vindicating his character, Elihu &s;aid to him, Take heed, regard not <HI>iniquity;</HI> for this ha&s;t thou cho&s;en rather than <HI>affliction.</HI> And God brought him to &s;ay, I abhor <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> and re|pent in du&s;t and a&s;hes. Job xxxvi. 21. xlii. 6. And they who lived by faith, cho&s;e to endure cruel mockings, &s;courgings, impri&s;onment, and death, rather than accept of deliverance in any &s;inful way. Heb. xi. 35&mdash;38. And from hence we may &s;ee,</P>
<P N="3">III. The infinite importance of a <HI>&s;eparation</HI> of the church of Chri&s;t from the world. He &s;ays, Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers; for what fellow&s;hip hath righteou&s;ne&s;s with unright|eou&s;ne&s;s? and what communion hath light with darkne&s;s? and what concord hath Chri&s;t with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth, with an infidel? and what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath &s;aid, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they &s;hall be my peo|ple.

Multitudes have been deceived with the pretence, that we are only required to &s;eparate from open infidels and idolators. But the Jews are more firm believers in revelation, and greater enemies to open idolatry, than any other men are, who are not born again. And the church of Rome are open idolators, and yet are as firm believers in revelation as any natural men are. It is al&s;o a certain fact, that putting bapti&s;m before a per&s;onal profe&s;&s;ion of faith in Chri&s;t, and holding a &s;ucce&s;&s;ive power in mini&s;ters to admini&s;ter it, came from the church of Rome. She is the <HI>mother of harlots,</HI> and all churches who go after any <HI>lovers</HI> but Chri&s;t, for a temporal living, are guilty of <HI>playing the harlot.</HI> When the prie&s;ts in I&s;rael did &s;o, God &s;aid, As troops of <HI>robbers</HI> wait for a man, &s;o the company of prie&s;ts <HI>murder</HI> in the way by con|&s;ent; for they commit <HI>lewdne&s;s.</HI> Ho&s;ea ii. 5. vi. 9. Chri&s;t is the only <HI>door</HI> into his church, and all teachers who do not come in by faith in him, are <HI>thieves</HI> and <HI>robbers.</HI> John x. 1&mdash;10. Suffering is unavoidable, in this &s;inful world; but the command is, Let none of you &s;uffer as a <HI>murderer,</HI> or as a <HI>thief,</HI> or as an evildoer, or as a <HI>bu&s;ybody</HI> in other men's matters: Yet if any man &s;uffer as a <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> let him not be a&s;hamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf. 1 Peter iv. 15, 16. The word which is here tran&s;lated <HI>bu&s;ybody,</HI> means an <HI>over&s;eer,</HI> and it is &s;ometimes tran&s;lated <HI>bi&s;hop.</HI> Therefore, after a glorious revival of religion in our land, fifty years

Yet many mini&s;ters in America, who received their power to be &s;upported <HI>by force,</HI> in the name of the king of Great-Britain, hold that power over the people to this day. They have exhorted rulers and people to venture their eternal all upon the truth of Chri&s;tianity, while them&s;elves refu&s;e to tru&s;t it for a worldly living. And this deceit and cruelty is made u&s;e of by many, to require their mini&s;ters to go a warfare at their own charges; and if mini&s;ters inculcate the laws of Chri&s;t for their &s;upport, artful men will ruin their characters, if po&s;&s;ible. Yea, as Chri&s;t was crucified between two thieves, even &s;o is his cau&s;e now dealt with. All the villainies that have ever been acted under the name of Chri&s;tianity, are ca&s;t as a reproach upon the pure laws of Chri&s;t; while the hypocri&s;y and infidelity of multitudes is recurred to, as a rea&s;on for continuing the u&s;e of force to &s;upport religious mini&s;ters. God &s;ays, A good name is rather to be cho&s;en than great riches, and loving favour rather than &s;ilver and gold. Prov. xxii. 1. Now all the country are engaged to detect, and to
<PB N="18" REF="023140_0017_0FBC7FB9A79C3A70">hang men who rob others of &s;ilver or gold; while multitudes will try every deceitful art to rob all of their good name, who fear and obey God above man. And when they have robbed them of their good name, they can al&s;o force away their money, for the &s;upport of deceitful teachers, and for other evil purpo&s;es. <HI>Stealing</HI> the <HI>words of God,</HI> is the wor&s;t kind of theft. Jer. xxiii. 30. This is done by claiming the <HI>promi&s;es</HI> of God, without obeying his <HI>precepts.</HI> The Jews who did &s;o, were guilty of <HI>&s;tealing, adultery,</HI> and <HI>&s;acrileges.</HI> Rom. ii. 21, 22. And how full is the world of the&s;e evils in our day! Multitudes claim the promi&s;e of God to Abraham, without doing the works of Abraham. For God &s;aid, I know him, that he will command his chil|dren, and his hou&s;hold after him, and they &s;hall keep the way of the Lord, to <HI>do ju&s;tice and judg|ment;</HI> that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath &s;poken of him. Gen. xviii. 19. <HI>He will,</HI> and <HI>they &s;hall,</HI> was the language of his fir&s;t covenant with Abraham and his &s;eed; and <HI>I will,</HI> and <HI>they &s;hall,</HI> is the language of his &s;econd cove|nant with them; and he took away the fir&s;t that he might e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;econd.

This he &s;ays of the world, while he &s;ays to his church, I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner, with &s;uch an one, no not to eat.&mdash;Put away from among your&s;elves that wicked per&s;on. 1 Cor. v. 11&mdash;13. But by <HI>confounding</HI> church and world together, which is my&s;tery Babylon, all the&s;e characters have been lawgivers and judges for the church of Chri&s;t. And now, <HI>truth is fallen in the &s;treet, and equity can|not enter.</HI> And the nations are rejoicing at the pro&s;pect of enjoying the honours and profits of re|ligion, without being tormented with fears of fu|ture puni&s;hment. Rev. xi. 7&mdash;10. But God will yet repay fury to his enemies, and recompen&s;e to the ISLANDS. And he &s;ays to the <HI>Redeemer in Zion, My Spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, &s;hall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy &s;eed, nor
<PB N="20" REF="023140_0019_0FBC7FBE4189C4B0">out of the mouth of thy &s;eed's &s;eed, &s;aith the Lord, from henceforth and forever.</HI> I&s;ai. lix. 14&mdash;21. And from hence an in&s;pired apo&s;tle proves, that the Jews will again be ingrafted into the church, by the word and Spirit of God, which will be <HI>life from the dead.</HI> Rom. xi. 15&mdash;27. Which &s;cripture hath been often brought to prove, that the <HI>natural</HI> off-&s;pring of Chri&s;tians are taken into the <HI>covenant of grace</HI> with them, without their own knowledge or choice; and al&s;o that &s;ouls who are truly convert|ed, may yet <HI>fall from grace</HI> received, and peri&s;h forever. And innumerable evils have proceeded from the practice of &s;etting every believer in the place of Abraham, in&s;tead of viewing him as an eminent type of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the great head of the church. For Abraham had no right to circum|ci&s;e any per&s;on who was not born in his hou&s;e, un|til he had bought him as a <HI>&s;ervant</HI> with money. And his &s;eed were to de&s;troy all the inhabitants of Canaan, when their iniquity was <HI>full.</HI> Gen. xv. 16. xvii. 13, 14. And as Chri&s;tian privileges are much greater than the Jews enjoyed, the nations who have profe&s;&s;ed the name of Chri&s;tianity, have claim|ed a right to &s;eize upon the lands of the heathen, and to de&s;troy or en&s;lave all men, as far as they could extend their &s;word. They have denied that God ever repealed his covenant with Abraham. Whereas circumci&s;ion was the &s;hedding of human <HI>blood.</HI> And after Chri&s;t had purcha&s;ed his people with his own <HI>blood,</HI> he &s;aid, Circumci&s;ion is no|thing, and uncircumci&s;ion is nothing, but the keep|ing the commandments of God. Ye are bought with a price, be not ye the <HI>&s;ervants</HI> of men. 1 Cor. vii. 19, 23. Which is a full repeal of the cove|nant of <HI>circumci&s;ion,</HI> as he calls his covenant with Abraham. Acts vii. 8. Infant bapti&s;m never was
<PB N="21" REF="023140_0020_0FBC7FBF7306E590">a commandment of God; but it is a wicked in|vention of men, whereby they have held his church in bondage. His &s;aints are his only temple here below; and becau&s;e the Jews rejected the <HI>&s;acrifice</HI> of Chri&s;t, God cho&s;e their delu&s;ions, and brought their fears upon them. I&s;ai. lxvi. 1&mdash;4. Acts vii. 48&mdash;53. They &s;aid, If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him; and the Romans &s;hall come and take away both our place and nation. Yet when a Roman governour would not condemn him for bla&s;phemy, they accu&s;ed him of high trea|&s;on, and &s;aid, If thou let this man go, thou art not Ce&s;ar's friend.&mdash;We have no king but Ce&s;ar. John xi. 48, xix. 12, 15. And Ce&s;ar came and burnt their temple, and de&s;troyed their nation, in a mo&s;t terrible manner. They &s;aid, Crucify him, cruci|fy him; and the Romans crucified a great num|ber of the Jews. The cau&s;e of their rage again&s;t Chri&s;t and his di&s;ciples, was the re&s;traint which light and truth laid upon their con&s;ciences. But God &s;aid, Why do the heathen rage, and the peo|ple imagine a vain thing? the kings of the earth &s;et them&s;elves, and the rulers take coun&s;el toge|ther, again&s;t the Lord, and again&s;t his <HI>Anointed,</HI> &s;aying, Let us break their <HI>bands</HI> a&s;under, and ca&s;t away their <HI>cords</HI> from us. P&s;alm ii. 1&mdash;3. Upon which the di&s;ciples lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and &s;aid, Lord, thou art God which ha&s;t made Heaven and earth, and the &s;ea, and all that in them is; who by the mouth of thy &s;ervant David ha&s;t &s;aid, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things? the kings of the earth &s;tood up, and the rulers were gathered together again&s;t the Lord, and again&s;t his <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> For of a truth again&s;t thy holy child Je&s;us, whom thou ha&s;t <HI>anointed,</HI> both Herod and Pontius Pilate,
<PB N="22" REF="023140_0021_0FBC7FC19F6CD0A8">with the Gentiles, and the people of I&s;rael were gathered together, for to do what&s;oever thy hand and thy coun&s;el determined before to be done. Acts iv. 24&mdash;28. The&s;e things were all determin|ed before by God, and yet were wickedly acted by men; which two things are now generally denied through the world. But let us learn,</P>
<P N="5">5. How God is fulfilling his word, in the late events of his providence. After the Jews returned from Babylon, and began to build the temple at Jeru&s;alem, &s;ome of their old men wept, becau&s;e it appeared as nothing in their eyes, in compari&s;on with Solomon's temple. But God &s;aid unto them, According to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, &s;o <HI>my Spirit</HI> remain|eth with you, fear ye not: for thus &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts, yet once, it is a little while, and I will &s;hake the Heavens and the earth, and the &s;ea, and the dry land; and I will &s;hake all nations, and the de&s;ire of all nations &s;hall come, and I will fill this hou&s;e with glory, &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts. Hag. ii. 5&mdash;7. And accordingly, the Son of God came into the &s;econd temple, and taught as no man ever did before. And after he had given him&s;elf a &s;acrifice for our &s;ins, he a&s;cended to Heaven, and gave the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t and fire,</HI> whereby three thou|&s;and &s;ouls were <HI>born in a day.</HI> And all who were thus born, in every country, <HI>As lively &s;tones, were built up a &s;piritual hou&s;e, an holy prie&s;thood to offer up &s;piritual &s;acrifices, acceptable to God by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> I pet. ii. 5. He is our only High Prie&s;t; and every one of his children are a holy prie&s;t|hood, who may come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. Heb. iv. 15, 16. The mercy-&s;eat was placed upon the ark, in which the
<PB N="23" REF="023140_0022_0FBC7FC28CD2C2B8">law of God was kept whole. Deut. x. 5. And he &s;aid, There I will meet with thee, and I will com|mune with thee from above the mercy-&s;eat, from between the two cherubims, which are upon the ark of the te&s;timony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of I&s;rael. Exod. xxv. 22. Therefore after Chri&s;t had a&s;|cended to Heaven, and given the Holy Spirit to his church, the apo&s;tle of the Gentiles &s;aid, See that ye refu&s;e not him that &s;peaketh; for if they e&s;caped not who refu&s;ed him that &s;pake on earth, much more &s;hall not we e&s;cape, if we turn away from him that &s;peaketh from Heaven: who&s;e voice then &s;hook the earth; but now he hath promi&s;ed, &s;aying, Yet once more I &s;hake not the earth only, but al&s;o Heaven. And this word, yet once more, &s;ignifieth the removing of tho&s;e things that are &s;haken, as of things which are made, that tho&s;e things which cannot be &s;haken may remain. Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may &s;erve God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear; for our God is a con&s;uming fire. Heb. xii. 25&mdash;29.</P>
<P>His fire of truth and love, removed the national con&s;titution of the Hebrew church, which was from Heaven, and it &s;hook down all earthly kingdoms. And though the Gentiles introduced national &s;chemes of religion, whereby the holy city of God hath been trodden under foot, ever &s;ince the bea&s;t aro&s;e out of the bottomle&s;s pit; yet when the &s;ev|enth angel &s;hall &s;ound his trumpet, great voices will be heard in Heaven, &s;aying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chri&s;t, and he &s;hall reign forever and ever.&mdash;And the temple of God was opened in
<PB N="24" REF="023140_0023_0FBC7FC6533C4160">Heaven, and there was &s;een in his temple the ark of his te&s;tament; and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail. Rev. x. 7. xi. 2, 15&mdash;19. Then it will be &s;een, that the only way of <HI>mercy for &s;inners,</HI> is by faith in Chri&s;t, in whom the two tables of the law are kept whole. For on the two command|ments, of loving God with all our powers, and loving our neighbours as our&s;elves, hang all the law and the prophets. Matt. xxii. 36&mdash;40. This is that good part, which &s;hall not be taken away from any who choo&s;e this law of love. Luke x. 25&mdash;28, 42. It is the circumci&s;ion of the heart, which delivers us from dogs, evil workers, and the conci&s;ion. Rom. ii. 29. Phil. iii. 2, 3. It is the change which God requires of us, and which he hath promi&s;ed to work in us. He &s;aid to the church of I&s;rael, Circumci&s;e the fore&s;kin of your heart, and be no more &s;tiff-necked. And when they were &s;cattered among all nations, he &s;aid, The Lord thy God will circumci&s;e thine heart, and the heart of thy &s;eed, to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart and with all thy &s;oul, that thou maye&s;t live.&mdash;The word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou maye&s;t do it. Deut. x. 16. xxx. 6&mdash;14. If any man have not the <HI>Spirit of Chri&s;t,</HI> he is none of his.&mdash;For Chri&s;t is the end of the law for righteou&s;ne&s;s to every one that believeth.&mdash;For with the heart man believeth unto righteou&s;ne&s;s, and with the mouth confe&s;&s;ion is made unto &s;alvation.&mdash;Him that is weak in the faith receive you, but not to doubtful di&s;putations. Rom. viii. 9. x. 4, 10. xiv. 1. Be|ware le&s;t any man &s;poil you through philo&s;ophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Chri&s;t;
<PB N="25" REF="023140_0024_0FBC7FC7BA04FB48">for in him dwelleth all the fulne&s;s of the Godhead bodily; and ye are <HI>complete</HI> in him, which is the HEAD of all principality and power.

<P>Yet in the &s;econd and third centuries, philo&s;ophy and vain deceit, carried teachers into the practice of &s;etting up them&s;elves as prie&s;ts, in di&s;tinction from the brethren; and of &s;etting up &s;ome teach|ers above others, under the name of bi&s;hops; with an imagination that they could regenerate per&s;ons by baptizing of them. And in the fourth century Con&s;tantine adopted this corrupt &s;cheme, as an en|gine of &s;tate-policy. And in writing to each bi&s;hop, he &s;tyled him, "Your holine&s;s." Which was &s;o plea&s;ing to them, that one of them went and delivered a long oration in the pre&s;ence of Con&s;tantine, in the thirtieth year of his reign, wherein he &s;aid, "His empire re&s;embleth the ce|le&s;tial empire, &s;o that lifting up his eyes to Hea|ven, he governeth his &s;ubjects in this inferior em|pire, according to the pattern and form of the heavenly empire. For law, which is king of all, hath pre&s;cribed a Monarchy to be a government mo&s;t &s;uitable to a prince and people. For a Mon|archy doth exceed all other kinds of common|wealths and manners of government; for that government is various which con&s;i&s;teth in an Ari|&s;tocracy, or a government of men equal in riches and dignity; al&s;o a Democracy, or government of the people, which is oppo&s;ed to a Monarchy, is rather a &s;editious confu&s;ion than a government."

And by removing the &s;eat of the em|pire to Con&s;tantinople, and dividing it among his three &s;ons, Con&s;tantine made way for the bi&s;hop of Rome to exalt him&s;elf above all men upon earth, and above the God of Heaven, who can never vi|olate his promi&s;e or oath, or entice any into &s;in. 2 The&s;&s;. ii. 3&mdash;12. And on May 4, 1493, the year after America was fir&s;t di&s;covered, the Pope gave it to the crown of Spain. And though he &s;oon after received a <HI>deadly wound,</HI> by the <HI>&s;word of the Spirit,</HI> yet that deadly wound was healed. Rev. xiii. 1&mdash;5, 11&mdash;18. For the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> bea&s;t hath carried blood and &s;lavery round the world, in gal|leys and gallant &s;hips, as far as the fir&s;t bea&s;t ever did. And the two bea&s;ts of Britain and Spain, agreed la&s;t fall to divide the lands and trade of the heathen, on the other &s;ide of the world, between them. Yet the <HI>&s;piritual tyranny,</HI> which came from Rome and England, is continued in &s;everal of the United States of America. For when the freemen of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts elected Delegates to frame a new con&s;titution of government for us, they em|powered
<PB N="27" REF="023140_0026_0FBC7FCB22B400B0">the majority in each corporation to force the re&s;t to &s;upport &s;uch religious teachers as they were plea&s;ed to choo&s;e.

If Roman catholics will &s;ay the&s;e words, they may be lawgivers and judges for us about the wor&s;hip of God. And in 1782, the doctrine of <HI>purgatory</HI> was publi&s;hed in Bo&s;ton. In 1783, the Pre&s;ident of the Univer&s;ity in Connecticut &s;aid to their legi&s;la|ture, "<HI>Dominion</HI> is founded in <HI>property;</HI> and re|&s;ides where that is, whether in the hands of the few
<PB N="28" REF="023140_0027_0FBC7FCE68B9D3B8">or many.&mdash;The <HI>congregational</HI> and <HI>pre&s;byterian</HI> de|nominations, however hitherto de&s;pi&s;ed, will, by the ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven, continue to hold the great|e&s;t figure in America; and, notwith&s;tanding all the fruitle&s;s labours and exertions to pro&s;elyte us to other communions, become more numerous than the whole collective body of our fellow <HI>prote&s;tants</HI> in Europe."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Election Sermon at Hartford, May 8, 1783, p. 8, 73.</NOTE> And on March 23, 1786, the legi&s;|lature of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts made a law, which gives each inhabitant the power of voting in town affairs, who pays two thirds more in one tax, than a poll tax. And it &s;ays, "That the freeholders, and other inhabitants in each re&s;pective town, qual|ified as afore&s;aid, at the annual meeting, for the choice of town officers, or at any other town meet|ing regularly warned, may grant and vote &s;uch &s;ums of money, as they &s;hall judge nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ettlement, maintenance and &s;upport of the mini&s;try, &s;chools, the poor, and other nece&s;&s;ary charges, ari&s;ing within the &s;ame town; to be a&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed upon the polls and property within the &s;ame, as by law provided."</P>
<P>Here the majority of voters in each town are empowered to compel the re&s;t to &s;upport &s;uch teachers as they are plea&s;ed to choo&s;e, without any regard to the faith of the Go&s;pel. Indeed they are to be <HI>prote&s;tant</HI> teachers. But this name orig|inated in Germany, twelve years after Luther began the reformation there; and above twenty thou&s;and men were hired from thence, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the <HI>prote&s;tants</HI> in Britain, in their late <HI>bloody</HI> attempt to en&s;lave America. And the <HI>congregational</HI> name was in|vented at Bo&s;ton, where they hanged four per&s;ons, an hundred and thirty years ago, for oppo&s;ing their <HI>cruel</HI> &s;cheme. And our con&s;titution &s;ays, "No
<PB N="29" REF="023140_0028_0FBC7FCF40DA4300">&s;ubordination of any one &s;ect or denomination to another, &s;hall ever be e&s;tabli&s;hed by law." And the men who framed it, &s;aid to the people, on March 2, 1780, "Your Delegates did not conceive them|&s;elves ve&s;ted with power to &s;et up one denomina|tion of Chri&s;tians above another; for Religion mu&s;t at all times be a matter between God and individ|uals." So that the above law is a violation of a foundation principle of our government, and di|rectly again&s;t the nature of religion. And <HI>hone&s;t</HI> people, in our various towns, are daily expo&s;ed to the &s;poiling of goods or impri&s;onment, for refu&s;|ing to undermine our government, and to violate their allegiance to our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. For he is the only <HI>lawgiver for his church;</HI> and <HI>every &s;oul who will not hear him, &s;hall be de&s;troyed from among the people.</HI> Acts iii. 22, 23. He was &s;o far from giving any countenance to his church, in their in|va&s;ion of the work of civil rulers, that when one de&s;ired him to &s;peak to his brother to divide the inheritance with him, Je&s;us &s;aid, <HI>Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?</HI> He knew that the way to avoid the <HI>leaven of hypocri&s;y,</HI> was to keep the government of his church di&s;tinct from the world. Luke xii. 1&mdash;14. Murder and lying came from the devil. John viii. 44. And from him came the power which has been claimed, by the churches of Rome and England, to <HI>divide</HI> the lands and trade of America between them. Neither can the putting of bapti&s;m before a per&s;onal con|fe&s;&s;ion of faith in Chri&s;t, and &s;upporting religious mini&s;ters by the &s;word of the magi&s;trate, be traced up to any better &s;ource. The covenant of cir|cumci&s;ion yoked believers and unbelievers together in the church of I&s;rael, until Chri&s;t came and &s;hed his blood for us. But the covenant of circum|ci&s;ion,
<PB N="30" REF="023140_0029_0FBC7FD0B6210670">and the covenant of grace, are as di&s;tinct in their nature, as Hagar and Sarah were in their condition, or as Sinai and Zion are in their &s;itu|ation. The <HI>children</HI> of the fir&s;t were <HI>born after the fle&s;h,</HI> while the <HI>children</HI> of the &s;econd are <HI>born after the Spirit;</HI> and <HI>the promi&s;e</HI> is to the children of the free woman. And Paul &s;ays, Stand fa&s;t therefore in the liberty wherewith Chri&s;t hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the <HI>yoke of bond|age.&mdash;A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.</HI> Gal. iv. 21&mdash;31. v. 1, 9.</P>
<P>And this country is now &s;o much leavened with hypocri&s;y, that our wi&s;e&s;t men have excluded all religious te&s;ts from the government of the&s;e Unit|ed States. And when great oppo&s;ition was made thereto at Bo&s;ton, three years ago, a noted con|gregational mini&s;ter &s;aid, "The great object of <HI>religion</HI> being God &s;upreme, and the &s;eat of religion in man being the heart or con&s;cience, that is, the rea&s;on God has given us, employed on our <HI>moral</HI> actions, in their mo&s;t important con&s;equences, as related to the tribunal of God, hence I infer, that God alone is the God of the con&s;cience, and con|&s;equently, attempts to erect human tribunals for the con&s;ciences of men, are <HI>impious</HI> encroachments upon the prerogatives of God." All religious te&s;ts, impo&s;ed by men, are again&s;t <HI>piety, religion,</HI> and <HI>morality.</HI> Yet the &s;ame mini&s;ter had &s;aid to our legi&s;lature, near ten years before, "Let the re|&s;traints of religion once be broken down, as they <HI>infallibly</HI> would be by leaving the &s;ubject of pub|lic wor&s;hip to the humours of the multitude, and we might well defy all human wi&s;dom and power to &s;upport and pre&s;erve order and government in the &s;tate." But as his <HI>infallibility</HI> has failed him, it is hoped that our civil rulers will &s;oon leave the
<PB N="31" REF="023140_0030_0FBC7FD230FD5608">government of the church to the laws and Spirit of Chri&s;t, and not believe any teachers, who will not <HI>tru&s;t</HI> him for a temporal living. For Je&s;us &s;ays, <HI>If any man love me, he will keep my words;</HI> and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. John xiv. 23. If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your hou&s;e, neither bid him God-&s;peed; for he that biddeth him God|&s;peed, is partaker of his evil deeds. 2 John 10, 11. Faithfulne&s;s in mini&s;ters and people to each other, and to avoid deceivers, are ever matters between God and individuals, as much as faith in Chri&s;t is for eternal &s;alvation. AND LET GOD BE TRUE, BUT EVERY MAN A LIAR.</P>
