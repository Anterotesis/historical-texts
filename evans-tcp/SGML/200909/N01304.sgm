<P>Suffer the Word of Exhortation, &mdash;in a <HI>FEW WORDS.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Publick <HI>Exhortation</HI> mu&s;t be at this Time, confined unto a <HI>Few words:</HI> The Time of the <HI>Year</HI> will have it &s;o! And &s;ince I am to Di&s;cour&s;e IN a <HI>few words,</HI> why &s;hould it be Thought Improper or Indecent, if I do it al&s;o OF a <HI>few words,</HI> and make that the <HI>Subject</HI> of my Di&s;cour&s;e?</P>
<P>Tho' I &s;hall not u&s;e more than a <HI>Few words</HI> be|fore I come to my <HI>Doctrine;</HI> yet I will be guilty of &s;o much Anticipation, as to tell you afore hand, it will be of this Importance; <HI>That a <HI>Few words</HI> may have more than Few or Small Things comprized in them.</HI></P>
<P>Ere I come to a more <HI>direct proof</HI> of that. I will fir&s;t ob&s;erve, an Intimation in the Text before us; That a Good <HI>Exhortation</HI> will &s;ometimes go down the better, becau&s;e there are but a <HI>Few words</HI> Employ'd upon it. <HI>Suffer the Exhortation,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle. One would think, it might have been &s;aid, <HI>Rejoyce</HI> in the <HI>Exhortation; Rejoyce</HI> that you Enjoy &s;uch an <HI>Exhortation.</HI> It &s;eems, Peo|ple
<PB N="2" REF="001552_0003_0FB3A311041C2F60">
are mo&s;t unrea&s;onably indi&s;po&s;ed unto what would be for their <HI>Good. Exhortations</HI> that have a Tendency to make them <HI>Good,</HI> and bring them to Eternal <HI>Good,</HI> &s;uch <HI>Exhortations</HI> are a <HI>Bur|den</HI> and a <HI>Grievance</HI> to them. Oh! the Folly, and Mi&s;chief of <HI>Sin! Original Sin,</HI> What a Depravati|on ha&s;t thou brought upon us! Our Apo&s;tle finds out an <HI>Argument</HI> why his <HI>Exhortation</HI> &s;hould be tolerable. But there &s;eems to be a <HI>Satyr</HI> upon Sin|ful Mankind in the <HI>Argument.</HI> Sayes he; <HI>Tis but in Few words;</HI> Men begrutch the <HI>Time</HI> for long Exerci&s;es and Entertainments of <HI>Religion.</HI> Brave Husbands of their <HI>Time!</HI> Of their <HI>Time,</HI> Two or Three Hours at a Time, can go well enough to meer Impertinencies; but <HI>One Hour</HI> in the <HI>Service</HI> of God; This is a <HI>Suffering.</HI> How many <HI>Hours</HI> of <HI>&V;&s;ele&s;s Conver&s;ation</HI> with a Friend are well e|nough! But <HI>One Hour</HI> to conver&s;e with GOD; This is to <HI>Suffer</HI> Egregiou&s;ly. An Hour or Two at the <HI>Table</HI> is well enough; A <HI>Quarter of an Hour</HI> in the <HI>Clo&s;et,</HI> This is an Hard&s;hip, and hardly to be <HI>Suffered.</HI> Rather <HI>a Thou&s;and Dayes El&s;ewhere,</HI> than One in the <HI>Courts of the Lord;</HI> Notable Re|deemers of <HI>Time</HI> indeed! Well, The affairs of Re|ligion, are, it &s;eems, to be Recommended unto the Children of Men, becau&s;e they may be di&s;|patched in a <HI>Few words</HI> in a very Little Time. I confe&s;s, I do not think, this is much for the <HI>Honour</HI> of the <HI>World!</HI></P>
<P>But then, I &s;ee Something that may be for the <HI>Honour</HI> of <HI>Religion,</HI> and of them that handle the affairs of it. It was alwayes thought an <HI>Honourable</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="001552_0004_0FB3A3128266CEA0">
Thing. <HI>To &s;ay much in a Little,</HI> I need not quote <HI>Euripides</HI> or <HI>Menander</HI> for it. You &s;hall find, They that write the <HI>Maxims of Prudence,</HI> will all tell you, <HI>There is no greater &s;ign of Wit, and Sen&s;e, than to &s;ay much in a Little.</HI></P>
<P>So did our Apo&s;tle. His <HI>Epi&s;tle to the Hebrews,</HI> is but a <HI>Short</HI> Epi&s;tle; it has but a <HI>Few words.</HI> But there is a <HI>Great Deal</HI> in it. It is full of <HI>My&s;teries.</HI> It is an admirable <HI>System of the Chri&s;tian Religion.</HI> There never was a <HI>Richer Compo&s;ure</HI> &s;een upon the Face of the Earth. When <HI>Four Excellent Volumns in Folio,</HI> coming after a Library of other Expo&s;i|tors, have &s;earch'd out the Truths contained in it, there is work yet left for more than as many more. <HI>More Trea&s;ures</HI> are &s;till behind; un&s;peakably more&punc; So that I can obtain this <HI>Doctrine</HI> for you;</P>
<P><HI>That much may be &s;aid in a <HI>Few words.</HI></HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Few words</HI> may have abundance of <HI>matter</HI> in them. A <HI>Few Drops</HI> of Expre&s;&s;ion, may have an <HI>Ocean</HI> of matter in them.</P>
<P>We will in a <HI>Few words</HI> proceed unto the De|mon&s;tration of it.</P>
<P N="1">I. The Great God has in a <HI>Few words</HI> com|prized all the <HI>Duty,</HI> that He has required of us. The <HI>Duty</HI> that we Owe to our God, it is very &s;ure, as there is <HI>much</HI> depends on it; <HI>Eternity</HI> depends on it! So, there is very <HI>much</HI> belongs to it. Well, But as <HI>much</HI> as our <HI>Duty</HI> is, I can carry you, where you &s;hall &s;ee a <HI>Few words</HI> containing of it.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Place; <HI>Ten Words</HI> are a <HI>Few Words.</HI> Now All our <HI>Duty</HI> is compriz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">d in <HI>Ten Words;</HI> You know what I mean; The
<PB N="4" REF="001552_0005_0FB3A31400B175B0">
Law of the <HI>Ten Commandments.</HI> The old <HI>Romans</HI> had a famous In&s;trument among them, called, <HI>The Law of the Twelve Tribes.</HI> They &s;ent Emba&s;&s;adors unto foreign Countrys, to bring home an Account, and a Copy of their <HI>Wi&s;e&s;t Laws.</HI> Then they Employ'd a Number of their <HI>Wi&s;est Men,</HI> to Dige&s;t and Compile a <HI>Body of Laws</HI> out of the&s;e. The Extract, which was a long while in making, was called, <HI>The Twelve Tables.</HI> When it was done, their Orators admired it for its Excellencies; but e&s;pecially for the, <HI>Mira Verborum concinnitas;</HI> its admirable Expre&s;&s;ivene&s;s; its Expre&s;&s;ing in a <HI>Few Words,</HI> the Greate&s;t and Brave&s;t Things that ever were uttered. And yet, we have reco|vered about an Hundred Laws that were in it; Many of them <HI>Fooli&s;h&punc;</HI> many <HI>Trifling,</HI> many <HI>Wick|ed</HI> Ones! Our <HI>Law of the Two Tables,</HI> does as much Exceed their <HI>Law of the Twelve Tables,</HI> as the <HI>Sun</HI> does Exceed a <HI>Gloworm.</HI> In the&s;e <HI>Few Words,</HI> Oh, how much is contained! Well might the Man of God &s;ay, P&s;al. CXIX. 96 <HI>Thy Commandment is Exceeding Broad</HI> Mind the <HI>Rules of Explication</HI> for the&s;e <HI>Few Words,</HI> and you will pre&s;ently be &s;en&s;ible of it</P>
<P>Remember&punc; fir&s;t; That <HI>the Law is Spiritual;</HI> It reaches to the <HI>Spirit;</HI> it calls for the Obedience of the <HI>Inward Man,</HI> as well as of the <HI>Outward Man.</HI></P>
<P>Remember &s;econdly; That when a <HI>Duty</HI> is Commanded&punc; the contrary <HI>Sin</HI> is Forbidden; and when a <HI>Sin</HI> is Forbidden, the contrary <HI>Duty</HI> is commanded.</P>
<P>Remember, thirdly, That when any <HI>One Duty</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="001552_0006_0FB3A315726C3400">
is Commanded, and when any <HI>One Sin</HI> is Forbid|den, all others of the <HI>Same kind</HI> are al&s;o Command|ed and Forbidden.</P>
<P>Remember, fourthly; That when any <HI>Duty</HI> is Commanded, all the <HI>Helps</HI> and all the <HI>Signs</HI> of &s;uch a Duty are al&s;o Commanded: And when any <HI>Sin</HI> is Forbidden, all the <HI>Cau&s;es,</HI> and all the <HI>Occa|&s;ions,</HI> and all the <HI>Appearances</HI> of &s;uch a Sin are al&s;o forbidden.</P>
<P>Remember, la&s;tly; Tis Exacted &amp; Expected, that we are not only to keep the Law <HI>our &s;elves,</HI> but al&s;o do all we can, and u&s;e all <HI>Good Means, that others</HI> may keep it.</P>
<P>Now &s;ay, Is not this <HI>Commandment Exceeding Bread?</HI> And have not a <HI>Few Words</HI> Excee|ding much Comprized in them? Truly, <HI>Brevius nihil e&s;t, nec Plenius i&s;tis.</HI> &mdash;</P>
<P>Here we ought to make a Pau&s;e; and in a <HI>Few Words</HI> de&s;cribe a <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion,</HI> which we mu&s;t all now be nece&s;&s;arily obliged unto.</P>
<P><HI>Confe&s;s,</HI> That your have not kept this <HI>Law;</HI> You are daily breaking of it: <HI>In many things we offend all. Confe&s;s,</HI> That your Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of this Law cannot be Numbred; <HI>Who can under&s;tand his Errors? Confe&s;s,</HI> That your <HI>Justification</HI> by your <HI>own Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> is for ever to be de&s;paired of. But then, <HI>Pitty.</HI> Pitty tho&s;e Deluded Creatures, who have not <HI>Seen an End of all Perfection;</HI>&mdash; but Imagine them&s;elves arrived unto a <HI>Sinle&s;s Perfecti|on.</HI> Unto their Proud <HI>A&s;&s;embly,</HI> my Soul, <HI>Be not thou &V;nited!</HI></P>
<P>I have &s;hown you a <HI>World</HI> of <HI>Duty,</HI> yea, the
<PB N="6" REF="001552_0007_0FB3A318F71DECA0">
<HI>whole</HI> of our <HI>Duty,</HI> comprized in <HI>Ten Words.</HI> Well, but I will &s;how it you in <HI>Three Words. <HI>Three</HI></HI> are not <HI>Many. Tribus Verbis,</HI> was an ancient Proverb for the greate&s;t <HI>Brevity</HI> imaginable In &s;o <HI>Few Words</HI> you have it; Mic. VI 8. <HI>He hath &s;hewed thee, O Man, the Good Thing. And what doth the Lord require of thee, but to Do Ju&s;tice, and to Love Mercy, and to Walk Humbly with thy God?</HI></P>
<P>More Briefly yet&punc; I will &s;how it you in <HI>Two Words. <HI>Two Words</HI></HI> are but <HI>Few Words.</HI> But now, what think you of tho&s;e <HI>Two Words?</HI> Matt. XXII 37.&mdash; 40 <HI>Thou &s;halt Love the Lord thy God, with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Mind. This is the Fir&s;t and Great Command|ment. And the Second is like unto it; Thou &s;halt Love thy Neighbour as thy &s;elf. On the&s;e two Com|mandments hang all the Law, and the Prophets.</HI> How much, how much do the&s;e <HI>Two Words</HI> carry in them! The very &s;ame, and it is a very <HI>In|&s;tructive Hint</HI> that I give you, when I tell you, tis the <HI>very &s;ame!</HI> &mdash; You have, 1 Joh III. 23 <HI>This is His Commandment, That we &s;hould Believe on the Name of His Son</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>and Love One another, as He gave us Commandment.</HI></P>
<P>Yea, What if I &s;hould &s;how you, where tis all compri&s;ed in <HI>One Word?</HI> I can do <HI>that!</HI> The <HI>Jews</HI> have a &s;aying That there are <HI>Six hundred and thirteen</HI> precepts in the <HI>Law;</HI> but that they are all reduced into that one Sentence; <HI>Heb.</HI> II. 4. <HI>The Ju&s;t by his Faith &s;hall live.</HI> There is a World of <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> in that &s;aying of theirs. There is much, much of the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> in it!</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="001552_0008_0FB3A31A9B3AF280">I can give another In&s;tance of &s;uch an <HI>Compre|hen&s;ive Sentence.</HI> Tis that <HI>Golden Rule</HI> of our Savi|our; Matth. VII. 12. <HI>All things what&s;oever ye would, that men &s;hould do unto you, Do ye even &s;o un|to them.</HI> A <HI>Rule</HI> acknowledged among the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles.</HI> The <HI>Jews</HI> have it in their <HI>Talmuds.</HI> Tis al&s;o in the <HI>Apocrypha.</HI> Among the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> the Moral Writers cry it up, an Army of them. One of the <HI>Emperors</HI> had it in his mouth continu|ally; and made the Officers of the Empire put it into publick Proclamations. But, Oh; how <HI>Ex|ten&s;ive</HI> in this Glorious <HI>Rule!</HI> Fir&s;t; All the <HI>Duty</HI> we owe to one another, is compri&s;ed in the&s;e <HI>Few Words.</HI> In all our <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> the&s;e <HI>Few Words,</HI> will Sugge&s;t <HI>All</HI> that we have to do. And in the <HI>Relations</HI> that we &s;u&s;tain, do but mind the&s;e <HI>Few Words,</HI> and our carriage will be marvellou&s;ly Regulated, you will find it marvellou&s;ly applica|ble to the Government of all your <HI>Actions,</HI> and all your <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions.</HI> Yea, Upon further Thoughts, I find this <HI>Rule of Rea&s;on</HI> Extendible beyond what I at fir&s;t imagined Our <HI>Duty</HI> towards our <HI>Creator</HI> may from this very <HI>Rule,</HI> receive &s;ome Direction, For if <HI>we</HI> had power to <HI>Create,</HI> we &s;hould certain|ly demand from <HI>our Creatures,</HI> all the Love, all the Honour, all the Service imaginable.</P>
<P>I will only add, You all know, our Lord gave his Di&s;ciples a <HI>Platform of Prayer,</HI> which in a <HI>Few Words</HI> does contain the whole matter of all our <HI>Prayers.</HI> Our <HI>Prayers</HI> may ask nothing of <HI>Our Fa|ther who is in the Heavens,</HI> (for &s;o the fir&s;t clau&s;e ought to be tran&s;lated,) but what this Exqui&s;ite
<PB N="8" REF="001552_0009_0FB3A31B92572508">
<HI>Platform</HI> allowes and contains. It contains be|yond <HI>all that we can ask or think!</HI></P>
<P>I will in a <HI>Few Words,</HI> yea, in <HI>One Word,</HI> give you the <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> for this <HI>Abbreviation of our Duty.</HI> Our Gracious God, has had <HI>Compa&s;&s;ion</HI> on our Frail and Weak Faculties in this <HI>Abbreviation:</HI> Particularly, on the <HI>Frailty</HI> and <HI>Weakne&s;s</HI> of our <HI>Memories.</HI> We can't <HI>Remember</HI> more than a <HI>Few Words.</HI> Our <HI>Duty</HI> mu&s;t be given us in a <HI>Few Words,</HI> that it may be the more Ea&s;ily <HI>Remembred</HI> with us. If it be not <HI>Remembred</HI> it will not be <HI>Practi&s;ed.</HI> I Remember a notable Word; Rom. IX. 28. <HI>The work, He will cut it &s;hort in Righteou&s;|ne&s;s.</HI> Some under&s;tand it of, <HI>The Go&s;pel. The Go&s;|pel</HI> is that <GAP DESC="foreign">, that <HI>Abbreviated word.</HI> The <HI>Law</HI> was Tedious: It had a <HI>Multipli|city</HI> of ob&s;ervances. But our Lord JESUS CHRIST comes, with a more <HI>Compendious work,</HI> and requires none of tho&s;e <HI>Long &V;ndertakings.</HI> One of the Ancients tells us, By the <HI>Short Word</HI> here, is meant, that <HI>Short word of Faith;</HI> Act. XVI. 31. <HI>Believe on the Lord Je&s;us Christ, and thou &s;halt be Saved.</HI> God has thus in <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and with a &s;weet <HI>Kindne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Goodne&s;s,</HI> con&s;idered our Ca|pacities.</P>
<P>Having offered you this Intimation, I will offer you a very <HI>Short</HI> Inference and <HI>In&s;truction</HI> from it.</P>
<P>Certainly, we may in Like manner <HI>Con&s;ider the Capacities</HI> of tho&s;e that are under <HI>our Instruction.</HI></P>
<P>It is po&s;&s;ible, we have poor Stupid Abject <HI>Ne|gro's</HI> under our Charge. Oh! Remember the <HI>Ac|count</HI> you mu&s;t give to the Glorious Lord, about
<PB N="9" REF="001552_0010_0FB3A31D87539C40">
the <HI>Souls</HI> of tho&s;e poor <HI>Negro's</HI> You complain, you can't make them Learn. Well, But in three &s;hort Que&s;tions well an&s;wered, you may have al|mo&s;t the whole <HI>Body of Divinity.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Who Made you and all the World?</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Great</HI> GOD <HI>Made me to Serve Him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Who Saves the Children of Men from all their Mi&s;eries?</HI></P>
<P>JESUS CHRIST, <HI>who is both God and Man, Saves them that Look unto Him</HI></P>
<P><HI>What will become of you when you Dye?</HI></P>
<P><HI>If I Obey</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>my Soul will go to the Heavenly Paradi&s;e; and He will afterwards Rai&s;e me from the Dead. If I continue Wicked, I &s;hall be ca&s;t among the Devils.</HI></P>
<P>It mu&s;t be an extraordinary <HI>Sotti&s;hne&s;s</HI> indeed, if the Learning of the&s;e <HI>Three Short Que&s;tions</HI> can't be infu&s;ed into them.</P>
<P>And thus, our <HI>Children.</HI> We may betimes get a whole <HI>Body of Divinity</HI> into their Little Souls. We are furni&s;hed with <HI>Abridgments</HI> of it. The <HI>A|brigments</HI> we have in our <HI>Hands,</HI> may be &s;oon get into their <HI>Minds.</HI> Yea, Sometimes <HI>one Text</HI> in the Bible, has <HI>All</HI> in it.

<P>There are the <HI>Benefits</HI> of our Great Saviour Propo&s;ed unto us in a <HI>Few Words;</HI> 1 Cor. I. 30. <HI>Ye are in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who of God is made unto us Wi&s;dom, and Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and Holine&s;s, and Re|demption.</HI> Chri&s;tian, Meditate all thy Dayes on tho&s;e <HI>Few Words;</HI> Thou wilt never fetch out all the <HI>Sweetne&s;s,</HI> all the <HI>Goodne&s;s,</HI> all the <HI>Glory</HI> of tho&s;e <HI>Few Words.</HI> All the Dayes of <HI>Methu|&s;elah,</HI> would not &s;uffice to do it in.</P>
<P>Tis only a <HI>Scriptural Demonstration,</HI> which I have hitherto given you, That <HI>much</HI> may be &s;aid in a <HI>Few Words.</HI> And &s;uch is the mo&s;t <HI>Suitable Demonstration;</HI> for a <HI>Preacher</HI> who would <HI>Seek out Acceptable Words.</HI> But then, for a more <HI>General Demon&s;tration,</HI> I need only refer you to the <HI>Rules of Implication</HI> One Thing will <HI>Imply</HI> many Things. A <HI>Few Words</HI> will have many, many <HI>Things</HI> in them, if the <HI>Rules of Implication</HI> be duely attended unto; And <HI>Wi&s;e Men</HI> will u&s;e to attend unto them.

are drawn out by the <HI>Rules of Implications,</HI> they may reach further than could have been ima|gined. There was a &s;ort of <HI>Sentences,</HI> that of old were called <HI>Laconi&s;ms.</HI> The Wi&s;e men of the Time and Place cho&s;e to Speak <HI>Laconically.</HI> They were very <HI>Sententious.</HI> They gave a De|mon&s;tration, <HI>That much may be Spoken in a <HI>Few Words.</HI></HI> I do not know, why this may not be Practi&s;ed among other People, as well as the <HI>Lacedaemonians.</HI> You Know, <HI>Vir Sapit;</HI> A <HI>Wi&s;e</HI> man will <HI>Speak Little;</HI> but &s;till much more <HI>Wi&s;e</HI> he that will <HI>Speak much in a Little.</HI></P>
<P>But in a <HI>Few Words,</HI> Let a Two-fold <HI>Ex|hortation</HI> arrive unto us.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> The <HI>Art</HI> and <HI>Skill</HI> of Expre&s;&s;ing our &s;elves in a <HI>Few Words,</HI> e&s;pecially on Some Occa&s;i|ons; Let this be more Studied; The <HI>Folly</HI> of u&s;ing <HI>too many Words,</HI> Let this be Di&s;liked, be Avoided.</P>
<P>It is fir&s;t, in our <HI>Devotions,</HI> that &s;uch a Study mu&s;t be maintained. In our <HI>Prayers,</HI> there is e&s;pecially One &s;ort of Words, which we &s;hould beware of having too many of them. <HI>Vowes</HI> are &s;uch Words. Take heed, Sirs, of having too many &s;uch. Thus we are advi&s;ed, Eccl V. 2. <HI>Let not thy Heart be ha&s;ty to utter any Word be|fore God; Let thy Words be Few.</HI></P>
<P>Our Saviour has al&s;o left another Caution with us; That we &s;hould not think, our <HI>Prayers</HI> will find the more Acceptance with Hea|ven, becau&s;e of <HI>Many Words</HI> u&s;ed in them.
<PB N="14" REF="001552_0015_0FB3A3260EBADFC0">
He has cautioned us; Matth. VI. 7. <HI>When ye Pray, u&s;e not Vain Repetitions, as the Heathen do; for they think, they &s;hall be heard for their much Speaking.</HI></P>
<P>I will add; Tho' there may be Occa&s;ion for us to be <HI>Long at Prayer;</HI> yet for a man to u&s;e <HI>Tautologies</HI> in his Prayer; to u&s;e <HI>many Words,</HI> and come with one thing over and over, on purpo&s;e to Spin out the Prayer; This is <HI>to take the Name of the Lord thy God in Vain!</HI></P>
<P>One thing more; We &s;hould not Slubber and Hurry over our <HI>Family-Prayers.</HI> They &s;hould be made, as by Men, who do not know, but that <HI>this is the La&s;t Prayer that over they &s;hall make in this World!</HI> Think &s;o, my Friend, when Kneeling down with thy <HI>Family.</HI> Yet it is for the mo&s;t part an Inconvenient Thing, to make tho&s;e <HI>Prayers</HI> very <HI>Long</HI> ones. It may be no Service to the Intere&s;ts of Piety in the Family. In a word, <HI>Chry&s;o&s;tom</HI> ob&s;erves it unto us, That CHRIST and <HI>Paul,</HI> commands us, to make our Prayers, <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>Short and Frequent.

<P>But then, We are to Watch again&s;t the <HI>Folly</HI> of <HI>Talking too much</HI> in all our <HI>Conver&s;ation.</HI> E&s;pecially, when the <HI>Errors</HI> of other People, are to be taxed, or when we are to Expre&s;s our <HI>Di&s;plea&s;ure,</HI> and <HI>Re&s;entment</HI> of their Mi&s;carriages

<P>But then, Thirdly; In a <HI>Few Words</HI> we are to &s;how the Believer, What <HI>Life</HI> he is to Lead; How he is to <HI>Live,</HI> that he may <HI>Dye</HI> with Safety and Comfort. Oh!
