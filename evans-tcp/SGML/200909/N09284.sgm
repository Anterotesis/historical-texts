<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I PRESUME to lay before Your Ma|je&s;ty the Hi&s;tory of a Period, which, if the abilities of the Writer were equal to the dignity of the Subject, would not be unworthy the attention of a Monarch, who is no le&s;s a Judge than a Patron of Literary Merit.</P>
<P>HISTORY claims it as her prerogative to offer in&s;truction to KINGS, as well as to their people. What reflections the Reign of the Emperor CHARLES V. may &s;ugge&s;t to your Maje&s;ty, it becomes not me to conjecture. But your Subjects cannot ob|&s;erve the various calamities, which that Monarch's ambition to be di&s;tingui&s;hed as a Conqueror, brought upon his dominions, without recollecting the felicity of their own times, and looking up with gratitude to their Sovereign, who, during the fer|vour of youth, and amid&s;t the career of victory, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch &s;elf-command, and maturity of judgment, as to &s;et bounds

to his own triumphs, and prefer the ble&s;|&s;ings of peace to the &s;plendour of military glory.</P>
<P>POSTERITY will not only celebrate the Wi&s;dom of Your Maje&s;ty's choice, but will enumerate the many Virtues, which render Your Reign con&s;picuous for a &s;a|cred regard to all the duties, incumbent on the Sovereign of a Free People.</P>
<P>IT is our happine&s;s to feel the influence of the&s;e Virtues; and to live under the dominion of a Prince, who delights more in promoting the Publick Welfare, than in receiving the ju&s;t Prai&s;e of his royal beneficence. I am,</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>NO period in the hi&s;tory of ones own country can be con&s;idered as altogether unintere&s;ting. Such tran&s;actions as tend to illu&s;trate the progre&s;s of its con&s;titution, laws or manners, merit the utmo&s;t at|tention. Even remote and minute events are objects of a curio&s;ity, which, being natural to the human mind, the gratification of it is attended with plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>BUT, with re&s;pect to the hi&s;tory of foreign States, we mu&s;t &s;et other bounds to our de&s;ire of information. The univer&s;al progre&s;s of &s;cience during the two la&s;t centuries, the art of printing, and other obvious cau&s;es, have filled Europe with &s;uch a multiplicity of hi&s;tories, and with &s;uch va&s;t collections of hi&s;torical materials, that the term of human life is too &s;hort for the &s;tudy or even the peru&s;al of them. It is nece&s;&s;ary, then, not only for tho&s;e who are called to conduct the affairs of nations, but for &s;uch as enquire and rea&s;on concerning them, to remain &s;atisfied with a ge|neral knowledge of di&s;tant events, and to confine their &s;tudy of hi&s;tory in detail chiefly to that period, in which the &s;everal States of Europe having become in|timately connected, the operations of one power are &s;o felt by all, as to influence their councils, and to re|gulate their mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>SOME boundary, then, ought to be fixed in order to &s;eparate the&s;e periods. An aera &s;hould be pointed out, prior to which, each country, little connected with tho&s;e around it, may trace its own hi&s;tory apart;
<PB N="vi" REF="011837_0018_0F9D86FE6FCC2138">
after which, the tran&s;actions of every con&s;iderable na|tion in Europe become intere&s;ting and in&s;tructive to all. With this intention I undertook to write the hi&s;tory of the Emperor CHARLES V. It was during his admini&s;tration that the powers of Europe were formed into one great political &s;y&s;tem, in which each took a &s;tation, wherein it has &s;ince remained with le&s;s variation, than could have been expected after the &s;hocks occa&s;ioned by &s;o many internal revolutions, and &s;o many foreign wars. The great events which happened then have not hitherto &s;pent their force. The political principles and maxims, then e&s;tabli&s;hed, &s;till continue to operate. The ideas concerning the balance of power, then introduced or rendered gene|ral, &s;till influence the councils of nations.</P>
<P>THE age of CHARLES V. may therefore be con&s;i|dered as the period at which the political &s;tate of Eu|rope began to a&s;&s;ume a new form. I have endeavour|ed to render my account of it, an introduction to the hi&s;tory of Europe &s;ub&s;equent to his reign. While his numerous Biographers de&s;cribe his per&s;onal quali|ties and actions; while the hi&s;torians of different coun|tries relate occurrences the con&s;equences of which were local or tran&s;ient, it hath been my purpo&s;e to record only tho&s;e great tran&s;actions in his reign, the effects of which were univer&s;al, or continue to be per|manent.</P>
<P>AS my readers could derive little in&s;truction from &s;uch a hi&s;tory of the reign of CHARLES V. without &s;ome information concerning the &s;tate of Europe pre|vious to the &s;ixteenth century, my de&s;ire of &s;upply|ing this has produced a preliminary work, in which I have attempted to point out and explain the great cau&s;es and events, to who&s;e operation all the improve|ments in the political &s;tate of Europe, from the &s;ub|ver&s;ion of the Roman Empire to the beginning of the &s;ixteenth century, mu&s;t be a&s;cribed. I have exhibited a view of the progre&s;s of &s;ociety in Europe, not only with re&s;pect to interior government, laws and man|ners, but with re&s;pect to the command of the natio|nal force requi&s;ite in foreign operations; and I have de&s;cribed the political con&s;titution of the principal

&s;tates in Europe at the time when CHARLES V. be|gan his reign.</P>
<P>IN this part of my work I have been led into &s;eve|ral critical di&s;qui&s;itions, which belong more properly to the province of the lawyer or antiquary, than to that of the hi&s;torian. The&s;e I have placed near the end of the fir&s;t volume, under the title of Proofs and Illu&s;trations. Many of my readers will, probably, give little attention to &s;uch re&s;earches. To &s;ome they may, perhaps, appear the mo&s;t curious and intere&s;t|ing part of the work. I have carefully pointed out the &s;ources from which I have derived information, and have cited the writers on who&s;e authority I rely with a minute exactne&s;s, which might appear to border upon o&s;tentation, if it were po&s;&s;ible to be vain of hav|ing read books, many of which nothing but the duty of examining with accuracy whatever I laid before the publick, could have induced me to open. As my in|quiries conducted me often into paths which were ob|&s;cure or little frequented, &s;uch con&s;tant recour&s;e to the authors who have been my guides, was not only nece&s;&s;ary for authenticating the facts which are the foundations of my rea&s;onings, but may be u&s;eful in pointing out the way to &s;uch as &s;hall hereafter hold the &s;ame cour&s;e, and in enabling them to carry on their re&s;earches with greater facility and &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>EVERY intelligent reader will ob&s;erve one omi&s;&s;ion in my work, the rea&s;on of which it is nece&s;&s;ary to ex|plain. I have given no account of the conque&s;ts of Mexico and Peru, or of the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Spa|ni&s;h colonies in the continent and i&s;lands of America. The hi&s;tory of the&s;e events I originally intended to have related at con&s;iderable length. But upon a near|er and more attentive con&s;ideration of this part of my plan, I found that the di&s;covery of the new world; the &s;tate of &s;ociety among its ancient inhabitants; their characters, manners, and arts; the genius of the European &s;ettlements in its various provinces, to|gether with the influence of the&s;e upon the &s;y&s;tems of policy or commerce in Europe, were &s;ubjects &s;o &s;plen|did and important, that a &s;uperficial view of them could afford little &s;atisfaction; to treat of them as ex|ten&s;ively
<PB N="viii" REF="011837_0020_0F9D86FFF3F28DB0">
as they merited, mu&s;t produce an epi&s;ode, di&s;proportionate to the principal work. I have there|fore re&s;erved the&s;e for a &s;eparate hi&s;tory; which, if the performance now offered to the public &s;hall receive its approbation, I propo&s;e to undertake.</P>
<P>THOUGH, by omitting &s;uch con&s;iderable but de|tached articles in the reign of CHARLES V. I have circum&s;cribed my narration within more narrow li|mits, I am yet per&s;uaded, from this view of the in|tention and nature of the work which I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to lay before my readers, that the plan mu&s;t &s;till appear to them too exten&s;ive, and the undertak|ing too arduous. I have often felt them to be &s;o. But my conviction of the utility of &s;uch a hi&s;tory prompted me to per&s;evere. With what &s;ucce&s;s I have executed it, the public mu&s;t now judge. I wait, in &s;olicitude, for its deci&s;ion; to which I &s;hall &s;ubmit with a re&s;pectful &s;ilence.</P>

<P>TWO great Revolutions have happened in the political &s;tate, and in the manners of the European nations.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The effects of the Ro|man power on the &s;tate of Europe.</NOTE> The fir&s;t was occa&s;ioned by the progre&s;s of the Roman power; the &s;econd by the &s;ubver&s;ion of the Roman Empire. When the &s;pirit of conque&s;t led the armies of Rome be|yond the Alps, they found all the countries which they invaded, inhabited by people whom they denominated barbarians, but who were neverthele&s;s brave and inde|pendent. The&s;e defended their ancient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions with ob&s;tinate valour. It was by the &s;uperiority of their di&s;|cipline, rather than of their courage, that the Romans gained any advantage over them. A &s;ingle battle did not, as among the effeminate inhabitants of A&s;ia, decide the fate of a &s;tate. The vanqui&s;hed people re&s;umed their arms with fre&s;h &s;pirit, and their undi&s;ciplined valour, animated by the love of liberty, &s;upplied the want of

conduct as well as of union. During the&s;e long and fierce &s;truggles for dominion or indepen|dence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The de&s;ola|tion which it occa&s;ion|ed.</NOTE> the countries of Europe were &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively laid wa&s;te, a great part of their inhabitants peri&s;hed in the field, many were carried into &s;lavery, and a feeble remnant, incapable of further re&s;i&s;tance, &s;ubmitted to the Roman power.</P>
<P>THE Romans having thus de&s;olated Europe, &s;et them&s;elves to civilize it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The im|provements which it in|troduced.</NOTE> The form of go|vernment which they e&s;tabli&s;hed in the con|quered provinces, though &s;evere, was regu|lar, and pre&s;erved public tranquillity As a con&s;olation for the lo&s;s of liberty, they communicated their arts, &s;ciences, language and manners, to their new &s;ubjects. Europe began to breathe, and to recover &s;trength after the calamities which it had undergone; agriculture was encouraged; population encrea&s;ed; the ruined cities were rebuilt; new towns were founded; an appearance of pro&s;perity &s;ucceeded, and repaired, in &s;ome degree, the havock of war.</P>
<P>THIS &s;tate, however, was far from being happy, or favourable to the improvement of the human mind.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The bad con&s;equen|ces of their dominion.</NOTE> The vanqui&s;hed nations were di&s;|armed by their conquerors, and overawed by &s;oldiers kept in pay to re&s;train them. They were given up as a prey to rapacious governors, who plundered them with impunity; and were drained of their wealth by exorbitant taxes, impo&s;ed with &s;o little attention to the &s;ituation of the provinces, that the impo&s;itions were generally increa&s;ed in proportion to their inability to &s;upport them. They were deprived of their mo&s;t enterprizing citizens, who re&s;orted to a di&s;tant capital in que&s;t of preferment, or of riches; and were accu&s;tomed in all their actions to look up to a &s;uperior, and tamely to receive his commands. Under all the&s;e depre&s;&s;ing circum&s;tances, it was impo&s;&s;ible that they could retain vigour or genero&s;ity of mind. The martial and independant &s;pirit, which had di&s;tin|gui&s;hed their ance&s;tors, became extinct among all the people &s;ubjected to the Roman yoke; they lo&s;t not only the habit but even the capacity of deciding for

<P>A SOCIETY in this &s;tate could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t long. There were defects in the Roman government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The irrup|tion of the barbarous nations.</NOTE> even in its mo&s;t perfect form, which threat|ened its di&s;&s;olution. Time ripened the&s;e original &s;eeds of corruption, and gave birth to many new di&s;orders. A con&s;titution, un&s;ound, and worn out, mu&s;t have fallen in pieces of it&s;elf, without any external &s;hock. The violent irruption of the Goths, Vandals, Huns, and other barbarians ha&s;tened this event, and precipitated the downfall of the Em|pire. New nations &s;eemed to ari&s;e, and to ru&s;h from unknown regions in order to take vengeance on the Romans for the calamities which they had inflicted on mankind. The&s;e fierce tribes either inhabited the various provinces in Germany, which had never been &s;ubdued by the Romans, or were &s;cattered over the va&s;t countries in the north of Europe, and north-we&s;t of A&s;ia, which are now occupied by the Danes, the Swedes, the Poles, the &s;ubjects of the Ru&s;&s;ian Empire, and the Tartars. Their condition, and tran&s;actions previous to their inva&s;ion of the Empire are but little known. All our information with re&s;pect to the&s;e is derived from the Romans; and as they did not pene|trate far into countries which were at that time uncul|tivated and uninviting, the accounts of their original &s;tate given by them are extremely imperfect. The rude inhabitants them&s;elves, de&s;titute of &s;cience, and of records, without lei&s;ure, or curio&s;ity to enquire into remote events, retained, perhaps, &s;ome indi&s;tinct memory of recent occurrences, but beyond the&s;e, all was buried in oblivion, or involved in darkne&s;s, and in fable <NOTE N="[B]" PLACE="foot">NOTE II.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE prodigious &s;warms which poured in upon the Empire from the beginning of the fourth century to the final extinction of the Roman power, have given ri&s;e to an opinion that the countries whence they

i&s;&s;ued were crowded with inhabitants; and various the|ories have been formed to account for &s;uch an extraordinary degree of population,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of the countries from which they i&s;&s;ued.</NOTE> as hath procured the&s;e countries the appella|tion of the <HI>Storehou&s;e</HI> of <HI>Nations.</HI> But if we con&s;ider that the countries po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the people who invaded the Empire were of va&s;t extent; that a great part of the&s;e was covered with woods and mar&s;h|es; that &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the barba|rous nations &s;ub&s;i&s;ted entirely by hunting or pa&s;turage, in both which &s;tates of &s;ociety large tracts of land are required for maintaining a few inhabitants; and that all of them were &s;trangers to the arts, and indu&s;try, without which population cannot increa&s;e to any great degree, it is evident, that the&s;e countries could not be &s;o populous, in ancient times as they are at pre&s;ent, when they &s;till continue to be le&s;s peopled than any other part of Europe or of A&s;ia.</P>
<P>BUT if the&s;e circum&s;tances prevented the barbarous nations from becoming populous, they con|tributed to in&s;pire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The people fit for dar|ing enter|prizes.</NOTE> or to &s;trengthen the mar|tial &s;pirit by which they were di&s;tingui&s;hed.

<P>THEIR fir&s;t inroads into the Empire proceeded rather from the love of plunder, than from the de&s;ire of new &s;ettlements.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The mo|tives of their fir&s;t excur&s;ions.</NOTE> Rou&s;ed to arms by &s;ome enterprizing or popular leader, they &s;allied out of their fore&s;ts; broke in upon her frontier provinces with irre&s;i&s;tible violence; put all who oppo&s;ed them to the &s;word; carried off the mo&s;t valuable effects of the inhabitants; dragged along multitudes of captives in chains; wa&s;ted all

Their &s;ucce&s;s, together with the accounts which they gave of the unknown conveniencies and luxuries that abounded in the countries better cultivated, or ble&s;&s;ed with a milder climate than their own, excited new adventur|ers, and expo&s;ed the frontier to new deva&s;tations.</P>
<P>WHEN nothing was left to plunder in the adjacent pro|vinces ravaged by frequent incur&s;ions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their rea|&s;ons for &s;et|tling in the countries which they conquered.</NOTE> they marched farther from home, and finding it difficult, or dangerous to return, they began to &s;ettle in the countries which they had &s;ubdued. The &s;udden and &s;hort excur&s;ions in que&s;t of booty, which had alarmed, and di&s;quieted the Empire, cea&s;ed; a more dreadful calamity im|pended. Great bodies of armed men with their wives and children, and &s;laves and flocks, i&s;&s;ued forth, like regular colonies, in que&s;t of new &s;ettlements. People who had no cities, and &s;eldom any fixed habitation, were &s;o little attached to their native &s;oil, that they migrated without reluctance from one place to another. New adventurers followed them. The lands which they de&s;erted were occupied by more remote tribes of barbarians. The&s;e in their turn, pu&s;hed forward into more fertile countries, and like a tor|rent continually increa&s;ing, rolled on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The extent of their &s;et|tlements.</NOTE> and &s;wept every thing before them. In le&s;s than two centuries from their fir&s;t irruption, barbarians of various names and lineage, plundered and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Thrace, Pannonia, Gaul, Spain, Africa, and at la&s;t of Italy, and Rome it&s;elf. The va&s;t fabrick of the Roman power which it had been the work of ages to perfect, was in that &s;hort period overturned from the foundation.</P>
<P>MANY concurring cau&s;es prepared the way for this great revolution, and en&s;ured &s;ucce&s;s to the nations which invaded the Empire.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cir|cum&s;tances which occa|&s;ioned the downfal of the Roman Empire.</NOTE> The Roman commonwealth had conquered the world by the wi&s;dom of its civil max|ims, and the rigour of its military di&s;cipline. But, under the Emperors, the former were
<PB N="6" REF="011837_0027_0F9D870530F12108">
forgotten or de&s;pi&s;ed, and the latter was gradually relaxed. The armies of the Empire in the fourth and fifth centuries bore &s;carce any re&s;emblance to tho&s;e invincible legions which had been victorious wherever they marched. In&s;tead of freemen, who voluntarily took arms from the love of glory, or of their country, provincials and barbarians were bribed or forced into &s;ervice. They were too feeble, or too proud to &s;ubmit to the fatigue of military duty. They even complained of the weight of their defen|&s;ive armour, as intolerable, and laid it a&s;ide. Infantry, from which the armies of ancient Rome derived their vigour and &s;tability, fell into contempt; the effeminate and undi&s;ciplined &s;oldiers of later times could &s;carce be brought to venture into the field but on hor&s;eback. The&s;e wretched troops, however, were the only guar|dians of the Empire. The jealou&s;y of de&s;poti&s;m had deprived the people of the u&s;e of arms; and &s;ubjects oppre&s;&s;ed and rendered incapable of defend|ing them&s;elves, had neither &s;pirit nor inclination to re&s;i&s;t their invaders, from whom they had little to fear, becau&s;e they could &s;carce make their condition more unhappy. As the martial &s;pirit became extinct, the revenues of the Empire gradually dimini&s;hed. The ta&s;te for the luxuries of the Ea&s;t increa&s;ed to &s;uch a pitch in the Imperial Court, that great &s;ums were carried into India, from whence money never returns. By the va&s;t &s;ub&s;idies paid to the barbarous nations a &s;till greater quantity of &s;pecies was with|drawn from circulation. The frontier provinces wa&s;ted by frequent incur&s;ions became unable to pay the cu&s;tomary tribute; and the wealth of the world, which had long centered in the capital of the Empire, cea&s;ed to flow thither in the &s;ame abundance, or was diverted into other channels. The limits of the Empire con|tinued to be as exten&s;ive as ever, while the &s;pirit re|qui&s;ite for its defence declined, and its re&s;ources were exhau&s;ted. A va&s;t body, languid, and almo&s;t unani|mated, became incapable of any effort to &s;ave it&s;elf, and was ea&s;ily overpowered. The Emperors, who had the ab&s;olute direction of this di&s;ordered &s;y&s;tem, &s;unk in the &s;oftne&s;s of Ea&s;tern luxury, &s;hut up within

the walls of a palace ignorant of war, unacquainted with affairs, and governed entirely by women and eunuchs, or by mini&s;ters equally effeminate, trembled at the approach of danger, and under circum&s;tances which called for the utmo&s;t vigour in coun&s;el as well as in action, di&s;covered all the impotent irre&s;olution of fear, and of folly.</P>
<P>IN every re&s;pect, the condition of the barbarous nations was the rever&s;e of that of the Ro|mans. Among them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cir|cum&s;tances which con|tributed to the &s;ucce&s;s of the bar|barous na|tions.</NOTE> the martial &s;pirit was in full vigour; their leaders were hardy and enterprizing; the arts which had ener|vated the Romans were unknown among them; and &s;uch was the nature of their military in&s;titutions, that they brought forces into the field without any trouble, and &s;upported them at little expence. The mercenary and effeminate troops &s;tationed on the frontier, a&s;toni&s;hed at their fiercene&s;s, either fled at their approach, or were routed in the fir&s;t on&s;et. The feeble expedient to which the Empe|rors had recour&s;e, of taking large bodies of the barba|rians into pay, and of employing them to repel new in|vaders, in&s;tead of retarding, ha&s;tened the de&s;truction of the Empire. They &s;oon turned their arms again&s;t their ma&s;ters, and with greater advantage than ever: for, by &s;erving in the Roman armies, they had acquired all the di&s;cipline, or &s;kill in war, which the Romans &s;till retained; and upon adding the&s;e to their native fero|city, they became altogether irre&s;i&s;table.</P>
<P>BUT though from the&s;e, and many other cau&s;es, the progre&s;s and conque&s;ts of the nations which over-ran the Empire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;pirit with which they carri|ed on war.</NOTE> became &s;o extremely rapid, they were accompanied with horrible deva&s;tations, and an incredible de&s;truction of the human &s;pecies. Civilized nations which take arms upon cool reflection, from motives of policy or prudence, with a view to guard again&s;t &s;ome di&s;tant danger or to prevent &s;ome remote contingency, carry on their ho&s;tilities with &s;o little rancour, or animo&s;ity, that war among them is di&s;armed of half its terrors. Barbarians are &s;trangers to &s;uch refinements. They

ru&s;h into war with impetuo&s;ity, and pro&s;ecute it with violence. Their &s;ole object is to make their enemies feel the weight of their vengeance, nor does their rage &s;ub&s;ide until it be &s;atiated with inflicting on them every po&s;&s;ible calamity. It is with &s;uch a &s;pirit that the &s;avage tribes in America carry on their petty wars. It was with the &s;ame &s;pirit that the more powerful and no le&s;s fierce barbarians in the north of Europe, and of A&s;ia, fell upon the Roman Empire.</P>
<P>WHENEVER they marched, their rout was marked with blood.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The de&s;ola|tion which they bro't upon Eu|rope.</NOTE> They ravaged or de&s;troyed all around them.

What e&s;caped the fury of the fir&s;t inundation peri&s;hed in tho&s;e which followed it. The mo&s;t fertile and populous provinces were converted into de&s;arts, in which were &s;cattered the ruins of vil|lages and cities, that afforded &s;helter to a few mi&s;erable inhabitants whom chance had pre&s;erved, or the &s;word of the enemy, wearied with de&s;troying, had &s;pared. The conquerors who fir&s;t &s;ettled in the countries which they had wa&s;ted were expelled or exterminat|ed by new invaders, who coming from regions farther removed from the civilized parts of the world, were &s;till more fierce and rapacious. This brought new calamities upon mankind, which did not cea&s;e until the north, by pouring forth &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;warms, was drained of people, and could no longer furni&s;h in|&s;truments of de&s;truction. Famine and pe&s;tilence, which always march in the the train of war when it rava|ges with &s;uch incon&s;iderate cruelty, raged in every part of Europe, and compleated its &s;ufferings.

The &s;tate it&s;elf, de&s;titute of union, either remained al|together inactive, or if it attempted to make any effort, that &s;erved only to di&s;cover its impotence.

In their progre&s;s towards the Holy Land, the followers of the cro&s;s marched through countries better cultivated, and more civiliz|ed than their own. Their fir&s;t rendezvous was com|monly in Italy, in which Venice, Genoa, Pi&s;a, and other cities had begun to apply them&s;elves to com|merce, and had made &s;ome advances towards wealth as well as refinement. They embarked there, and landing in Dalmatia, pur&s;ued their route by land to Con&s;tantinople.

Con&s;tantinople was the only mart in Europe for the commodities of the Ea&s;t-Indies.

who had a&s;&s;umed the cro&s;s found the remains of the knowledge and arts which the example and en|couragement of the Caliphs had diffu&s;ed through their empire. Although the attention of the hi&s;torians of the Cru&s;ades was fixed on other objects than the &s;tate of &s;ociety and manners among the nations which they invaded, although mo&s;t of them had neither ta&s;te nor di&s;cernment enough to de&s;cribe them, they relate, however, &s;uch &s;ignal acts of humanity and genero&s;i|ty in the conduct of Saladin as well as &s;ome other lead|ers of the Mahometans, as give us a very high idea of their manners. It was not po&s;&s;ible for the Cru&s;aders to travel through &s;o many countries, and to behold their various cu&s;toms and in&s;titutions without acquir|ing information and improvement.

Accordingly we di&s;cover, &s;oon af|ter the commencement of the Cru&s;ades, greater &s;plen|dour in the courts of Princes, greater pomp in pub|lic ceremonies, a more refined ta&s;te in plea&s;ure and amu&s;ements, together with a more romantic &s;pirit of enterprize &s;preading gradually over Europe; and to the&s;e wild expeditions, the effect of &s;uper&s;tition or folly, we owe the fir&s;t gleams of light which tended to di&s;pel barbarity and ignorance.</P>

The &s;pirit of indu&s;try revived. Commerce became an ob|ject of attention, and began to flouri&s;h. Population increa&s;ed. Independence was e&s;tabli&s;hed; and wealth flowed into cities which had long been the &s;eat of po|verty and oppre&s;&s;ion. Wealth was accompanied by its u&s;ual attendants, o&s;tentation and luxury; and though the former was inelegant and cumber&s;ome, and the latter indelicate, they led gradually to great|er refinement in manners, and in the habits of life. Together with this improvement in manners, a more regular &s;pecies of government and police was introdu|ced. As cities grew to be more populous, and the occa&s;ions of intercour&s;e among men increa&s;ed, &s;tatutes and regulations multiplied of cour&s;e, and all became &s;en&s;ible that their common &s;afety depended on ob&s;erv|ing them with exactne&s;s, and on puni&s;hing &s;uch as vi|olated them, with promptitude and rigour.

as they deemed mo&s;t beneficial to their &s;mall &s;ociety, and granted their &s;uperior &s;uch &s;upplies of money as were proportionable to their abilities, or to his wants. The barons them&s;elves, conformable to the &s;ame maxim, were admitted into the &s;upreme a&s;|&s;embly of the nation, and concurred with the &s;overeign in enacting laws, or in impo&s;ing taxes. As the &s;upe|rior lord, according to the original plan of feudal po|licy, retained the direct property of tho&s;e lands which he granted, in temporary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, to his va&s;&s;als, the law, even after fiefs became hereditary, &s;till &s;up|po&s;ed this original practice to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and a baron con|tinued to be con&s;idered as the guardian of all who re|&s;ided within his territories. The great council of each nation, whether di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of a par|liament, a diet, the Cortes, or the &s;tates general, was compo&s;ed entirely of &s;uch barons and dignified eccle|&s;ia&s;ticks, as held immediately of the crown. Towns, whether &s;ituated in the royal domaine, or on the lands of a &s;ubject, depended for protection on the lord of whom they held. They had no legal name, no poli|tical exi&s;tence, which could entitle them to be admit|ted into the legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly, or could give them any authority there. But as &s;oon as they were en|franchi&s;ed, and formed into Bodies Corporate, they became legal and independent members of the con&s;ti|tution, and acquired all the rights e&s;&s;ential to freemen. Among&s;t the&s;e, the mo&s;t valuable, was the privilege of a deci&s;ive voice in enacting laws, and in granting &s;ub&s;idies. It was natural for cities, accu&s;tomed to a form of municipal government, according to which no regulation could be e&s;tabli&s;hed, and no money could be rai&s;ed without their own con&s;ent, to claim this pri|vilege. The wealth, the power and con&s;ideration which they acquired on recovering their liberty add|ed weight to their claim; and favourable events hap|pened, or fortunate conjunctures occurred in the diffe|rent kingdoms of Europe, which facilitated or for|warded their obtaining po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this important right.

THE various expedients which were employed in order to introduce a more re|gular, equal and vigorous admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, contributed greatly towards the im|provement of &s;ociety. What was the parti|cular mode of di&s;pen&s;ing ju&s;tice in the &s;eve|ral barbarous nations which over-ran the Ro|man Empire, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of its diffe|rent provinces, cannot now be determined with cer|tainty. We may conclude from the form of govern|ment e&s;tabli&s;hed among them, as well as from their ideas concerning the nature of &s;ociety, that the au|thority of the magi&s;trate was extremely limited, and the independance of individuals proportionably great. Hi&s;tory and records, as far as they reach back, ju&s;ti|fy this conclu&s;ion, and repre&s;ent the ideas and exerci&s;e of ju&s;tice in all the countries of Europe, as little diffe|rent from tho&s;e which mu&s;t take place in a &s;tate of na|ture.

le&s;s regarded in practice. The magi&s;trate could &s;carce be &s;aid to hold the &s;word of ju&s;tice; it was left in the hands of private per&s;ons. Re&s;entment was almo&s;t the &s;ole motive for pro&s;ecuting crimes; and to gratify that pa&s;&s;ion, was the end and rule in puni&s;hing them. He who &s;uffered the wrong, was the only per&s;on who had a right to pur&s;ue the aggre&s;&s;or, and to exact or to remit the puni&s;hment.

The church co|operated with the civil magi&s;trate, and interpo&s;ed its authority in order to extirpate a practice &s;o repug|nant to the &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity.

The aid of religion was called in to combat and &s;ubdue the ferocity of the times. The Almighty was &s;aid to have manife&s;ted, by vi&s;ions and revelations to different per&s;ons, his di&s;|approbation of that &s;pirit of revenge, which armed one part of his creatures again&s;t the other. Men were re|quired, in the name of God, to &s;heath their &s;words, and to remember the &s;acred ties which united them as Chri&s;tians, and as members of the &s;ame &s;ociety. But this junction of civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tic authority, though &s;trengthened by every thing mo&s;t apt to alarm and to over-awe the credulous &s;pirit of tho&s;e ages, produced no other effect than &s;ome temporary &s;u&s;pen&s;ions of ho&s;|tilities, and a ce&s;&s;ation from war on certain days and &s;ea&s;ons con&s;ecrated to the more &s;olemn acts of devoti|on. The nobles continued to a&s;&s;ert this dangerous privilege; they refu&s;ed to obey &s;ome of the laws cal|culated to annul or circum&s;cribe it; they eluded others; they petitioned; they remon&s;trated; they &s;truggled for the right of private war as the highe&s;t and mo&s;t honourable di&s;tinction of their order.

As the right of private war left many of the quarrels among indivi|duals to be decided, like tho&s;e between na|tions, by arms; the form of trial by judici|al combat, which was e&s;tabli&s;hed in every country of Europe, bani&s;hed equity from courts of ju&s;tice, and rendered chance or force the arbiter of their determi|nations.

Even in criminal ca&s;es, where a particular fact mu&s;t be a&s;certained, or an accu&s;ation be di&s;proved, the nature and effect of legal evidence was little under&s;tood by barbarous na|tions.

There were circum&s;tances, however, which led the nations of Europe to con&s;ider this equivocal mode of deciding any point in conte&s;t, as a direct appeal to heaven, and a certain method of di&s;covering its will. As men are unable to compre|hend the manner in which the Almighty carries on the government of the univer&s;e, by equal, fixed and general laws, they are apt to imagine that in every ca&s;e which their pa&s;&s;ions or intere&s;t render important in their own eyes, the Supreme Ruler of all ought vi&s;ibly to di&s;play his power, in vindicating innocence and puni&s;hing vice. It requires no incon&s;iderable degree of &s;cience and philo&s;ophy to correct this popular error. But the &s;entiments prevalent in Europe during the dark ages, in&s;tead of correcting, &s;trengthened it. Re|ligion, for &s;everal centuries, con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in be|lieving the legendary hi&s;tory of tho&s;e &s;aints who&s;e names crowd and di&s;grace the Romi&s;h calendar. The fabulous tales concerning their miracles, had been de|clared authentic by the bulls of Popes, and the decrees of councils; they made the great &s;ubject of the in|&s;tructions which the clergy offered to the people, and were received by them with implicit credulity and ad|miration. By the&s;e, men were accu&s;tomed to believe that the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of nature might be violated on the mo&s;t frivolous occa&s;ions, and were taught to look rather for particular and extraordinary acts of power under the divine admini&s;tration, than to con|template the regular progre&s;s and execution of a ge|neral plan. One &s;uper&s;tition prepared the way for another; and whoever believed that the Supreme Being had interpo&s;ed miraculou&s;ly on tho&s;e trivial oc|ca&s;ions mentioned in legends, could not but expect his intervention in matters of greater importance, when &s;olemnly referred to his deci&s;ion.</P>

To be ready to main|tain with his &s;word whatever his lips had uttered, was the fir&s;t maxim of honour with every gentleman. To a&s;&s;ert their own rights by force of arms, to inflict ven|geance on tho&s;e who had injured or affronted them, were the di&s;tinction and pride of high-&s;pirited nobles. The form of trial by combat coinciding with this maxim, flattered and gratified the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions. Every man was the guardian of his own honour, and of his own life; the ju&s;tice of his cau&s;e, as well as his future reputati|on, depended on his own courage and prowe&s;s. This mode of deci&s;ion was con&s;idered, accordingly, as one of the happie&s;t efforts of wi&s;e policy; and as &s;oon as it was introuduced, all the forms of trial by fire or wa|ter, and other &s;uper&s;titious experiments, fell into di&s;|u&s;e, or were employed only in controver&s;ies between per&s;ons of inferior rank. The trial by combat was au|thori&s;ed over all Europe, and received in every coun|try with equal &s;atisfaction. Not only que&s;tions con|cerning uncertain or conte&s;ted facts, but general and ab&s;tract points in law were determined by the i&s;&s;ue of a combat; and the latter was deemed a method of di&s;|covering truth more liberal as well as more &s;atisfacto|ry, than that by examination and argument. Not only might parties, who&s;e minds were exa&s;perated by the eagerne&s;s and the ho&s;tility of oppo&s;ition, defy their antagoni&s;t, and require him to make good his charge, or to prove his innocence, with his &s;word; but wit|ne&s;&s;es, who had no intere&s;t in the i&s;&s;ue of the que&s;tion, though called to declare the truth by laws which ought to have afforded them protection, were equally expo&s;ed to the danger of a challenge, and equally bound to a&s;&s;ert the veracity of their evidence by dint of arms. To complete the ab&s;urdities of this military juri&s;prudence, even the character of a judge was not &s;acred from its violence. Any one of the parties might interrupt a judge when about to deliver his opinion; might accu&s;e him of iniquity and corruption in the mo&s;t reproachful terms, and throwing down

<P>THESE pernicious effects of the trial by combat were &s;o obvious,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Various ex|pedients for aboli&s;hing this practice.</NOTE> that they did not altogether e&s;cape the view of the unob&s;erv|ing age in which it was introduced.

But the maxims and pa&s;&s;ions which favour it, had taken &s;uch hold of the minds of men, that they di&s;regarded admonitions and cen&s;ures, which, on other occa&s;ions, would have &s;truck them with terror. The evil was too great and inveterate to yield to that reme|dy, and continuing to increa&s;e, the civil power at length found it nece&s;&s;ary to interpo&s;e. Con&s;cious, however, of their own limited authority, monarchs proceeded with caution, and their fir&s;t attempt to re|&s;train, or to &s;et any bounds to this practice, were extreme|ly feeble. One of the earlie&s;t re&s;trictions of this practice which occurs in the hi&s;tory of Europe, is that of Hen|ry I. of England.

St. Louis, who&s;e ideas as a legi&s;lator, were far &s;uperi|or to tho&s;e of his age, endeavoured to introduce a more perfect juri&s;prudence, and to &s;ub&s;titute the trial by evidence, in place of that by combat.

In other countries of Europe, efforts equally zealous were employed to maintain the e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;|tom; and &s;imilar conce&s;&s;ions were extorted from their re&s;pective &s;overeigns. It continued, however, to be an object of policy with every monarch of abilities or vigour, to explode the trial by combat; and various edicts were i&s;&s;ued for this purpo&s;e. But the ob&s;erva|tion which was made concerning the right of private war, is equally applicable to the mode of trial under re|view. No cu&s;tom, how ab&s;urd &s;oever it may be, if it has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted long, or derives its force from the man|ners and prejudices of the age in which it prevails, was ever aboli&s;hed by the bare promulgation of laws and &s;tatutes. The &s;entiments of the people mu&s;t change, or &s;ome new power &s;ufficient to counteract it mu&s;t be introduced. Such a change, accordingly, took place in Europe, as &s;cience gradually increa&s;ed and &s;ociety advanced towards more perfect order. In proportion as the prerogative of Princes extended, and came to acquire new force, a power, intere&s;ted in &s;up|pre&s;&s;ing every practice favourable to the independance of the nobles, was introduced. The &s;truggle, never|thele&s;s, &s;ub&s;i&s;ted for &s;everal centuries; &s;ometimes the new regulations and ideas &s;eemed to gain ground; &s;ometimes ancient habits recurred; and though, up|on the whole, the trial by combat went more and more into di&s;u&s;e, yet in&s;tances of it occur, as late as the &s;ixteenth century, in the hi&s;tory both of France and of England. In proportion as it declined, the regular admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice was re&s;tored, the proceedings of courts were directed by known laws, the &s;tudy of the&s;e became an object of attention to judges, and the people of Europe advanced fa&s;t towards civility, when this great cau&s;e of the ferocity of their manners was removed <NOTE N="[Y]" PLACE="foot">NOTE XXII.</NOTE>.</P>

Among the rude people who conquered the various provinces of the Roman Empire, and e&s;tabli&s;hed new kingdoms there, the pa&s;&s;ion of re&s;entment, too impetuous to bear con|troul, was permitted to remain almo&s;t unre&s;trained by the authority of laws. The per&s;on offended, as has been ob&s;erved, retained not only the right of pro&s;e|cuting but of puni&s;hing his adver&s;ary. To him it be|longed to inflict &s;uch vengeance as &s;atiated his rage, or to accept of &s;uch &s;atisfaction as appea&s;ed it. But while fierce barbarians continued to be the &s;ole judges in their own cau&s;e, their enmities were implacable, and immortal; they &s;et no bounds either to the degree of their vengeance, or to the duration of their re&s;ent|ment. The exce&s;&s;es which this occa&s;ioned, proved &s;o de&s;tructive of peace and order in &s;ociety, as forced them to think of &s;ome remedy.

But as &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to per&s;ons who had no legal or ma|gi&s;terial

The leader whom they were accu&s;tomed to follow and to obey, who&s;e courage they re&s;pected, and in who&s;e integrity they placed confidence, was the per&s;on to whom a martial people naturally committed this important preroga|tive. Every chieftain was the commander of his tribe in war, and their judge in peace. Every baron led his va&s;&s;als to the field, and admini&s;tered ju&s;tice to them in his hall. Their high-&s;pirited dependants would not have recognized any other authority, or have &s;ubmitted to any other juri&s;diction. But in times of turbulence and violence, the exerci&s;e of this new function was attended not only with trouble, but with danger. No per&s;on could a&s;&s;ume the character of a judge, if he did not po&s;&s;e&s;s power &s;ufficient to protect the one party from the violence of private revenge, and to compel the other to accept of &s;uch reparation as he enjoined.

In order to guard again&s;t any appearance of &s;ubordination in their courts to tho&s;e of the crown, they con&s;trained their monarchs to prohibit the royal judges from entering their territories, or from claim|ing any juri&s;diction there; and if, either through mi&s;take, or from the &s;pirit of encroachment, any roy|al judge ventured to extend his authority to the va&s;|&s;als of a baron, they might plead their right of exemp|tion, and the lord of whom they held could not only re&s;|cue them out of his hands, but was entitled to legal reparation for the injury and affront offered to him. The juri&s;diction of the royal judges &s;carce reached be|yond the narrow limits of the King's deme&s;nes. In|&s;tead of a regular gradation of courts, all acknowledg|ing the authority of the &s;ame general laws, and look|ing up to the&s;e as the guides of their deci&s;ions, there were in every feudal kingdom a thou&s;and independ|ent tribunals, the proceedings of which were directed by local cu&s;toms and contradictory forms. The colli|&s;ion of juri&s;diction between the&s;e numerous courts, of|ten retarded the execution of ju&s;tice: The variety and caprice of their modes of procedure mu&s;t have for ever kept the admini&s;tration of it from attaining any degree of uniformity or perfection.</P>
<P>ALL the monarchs of Europe perceived the&s;e encroachments on their juri&s;diction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Expedients employed in order to li|mit or abo|li&s;h it.</NOTE> and bore them with impatience. But the u&s;urpations of the nobles were &s;o firmly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, and the danger of endeavouring to overturn them by open force was &s;o manife&s;t, that they were obliged to remain &s;atisfied with attempts to undermine them. Various expedients were employed for this

purpo&s;e; each of which merit attention, as they mark the progre&s;s of law and equity in the &s;everal king|doms of Europe. At fir&s;t, Princes endeavoured to circum&s;cribe the juri&s;diction of the barons, by permit|ting them to take cognizance only of &s;maller offences, re&s;erving tho&s;e of greater moment, under the appel|lation of <HI>Pleas of the Crown,</HI> and <HI>Royal Cau&s;es,</HI> to be tried in the King's courts. This affected only the ba|rons of inferior note; the more powerful nobles &s;corn|ed &s;uch a di&s;tinction, and not only claimed unlimited juri&s;diction, but obliged their &s;overeigns to grant them charters, conveying or recognizing this privilege in the mo&s;t ample form. The attempt, neverthele&s;s, was productive of &s;ome good con&s;equences, and paved the way for more. It turned the attention of men to|wards a juri&s;diction di&s;tinct from that of the baron who&s;e va&s;&s;als they were; it accu&s;tomed them to the preten&s;ions of &s;uperiority which the crown claimed over territorial judges; and taught them, when op|pre&s;&s;ed by their own &s;uperior lord to look up to their &s;overeign as their protector. This facilitated the in|troduction of appeals, by which Princes brought the deci&s;ions of the baron's courts under the review of the royal judges. While trial by combat &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in full vigour, no point decided according to that mode, could be brought under the review of another court. It had been referred to the judgment of God; the i&s;|&s;ue of battle had declared his will; and it would have been impious to have called in que&s;tion the equity of the divine deci&s;ion. But as &s;oon as that barbarous cu&s;tom began to fall into di&s;u&s;e, Princes encouraged the va&s;&s;als of the barons to &s;ue for redre&s;s, by appeal|ing to the royal courts. The progre&s;s, however, of this practice, was &s;low and gradual. The fir&s;t in&s;tan|ces of appeals were on account of <HI>the delay,</HI> or <HI>the refu|&s;al of ju&s;tice</HI> in the baron's court; and as the&s;e were countenanced by the ideas of &s;ubordination in the feudal con&s;titution, the nobles allowed them to be in|troduced without much oppo&s;ition. But when the&s;e were followed by appeals on account of <HI>the inju&s;tice,</HI> or <HI>iniquity of the &s;entence,</HI> the nobles then began to be &s;en&s;ible, that if this innovation became general, the

&s;hadow of power alone would remain in their hands, and all real authority and juri&s;diction would center in tho&s;e courts which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the right of review. They in&s;tantly took the alarm, remon&s;trated again&s;t the en|croachments, and contended boldly for their ancient privileges. But the monarchs in the different king|doms of Europe pur&s;ued their plan with &s;teadine&s;s and prudence. Though forced to &s;u&s;pend their operati|ons, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, and &s;eemingly to yield when any formidable confederacy of their va&s;&s;als united again&s;t them, they re&s;umed their mea&s;ures, as &s;oon as they ob&s;erved the nobles to be remi&s;s or feeble, and pu&s;hed them with vigour. They appointed the royal courts which originally were ambulatory, and irregular with re&s;pect to their times of meet|ing, to be held in a fixed place, and at &s;tated &s;ea&s;ons. They were &s;olicitous to name judges of more di&s;tin|gui&s;hed abilities than &s;uch as pre&s;ided in the courts of the barons. They added dignity to their character, and &s;plendour to their a&s;&s;emblies. They laboured to render their forms regular, and their decrees con&s;i&s;t|ent. Such judicatories became, of cour&s;e, the ob|jects of public confidence as well as veneration. The people, relinqui&s;hing the partial tribunals of their lords, were eager to bring every &s;ubject of conte&s;t un|der the more equal and di&s;cerning eye of tho&s;e whom their &s;overeign had cho&s;en to give judgment in his name. Thus Kings became once more the heads of the community, and the di&s;pen&s;ers of ju&s;tice to their &s;ubjects. The barons, in &s;ome kingdoms, cea&s;ed to exerci&s;e their right of juri&s;diction, becau&s;e it &s;unk in|to contempt; in others, it was circum&s;cribed by &s;uch regulations as rendered it innocent, or it was entirely aboli&s;hed by expre&s;s &s;tatutes.

Upon the maxims of that excel|lent &s;y&s;tem, they founded a code of laws con&s;onant to the great principles of equity. Being directed by fixed and known rules, the forms of their courts were a&s;certained, and their deci&s;ions became uniform and con&s;i&s;tent.

The &s;ame &s;pirit of enterprize which had prompted &s;o many gentlemen to take arms in defence of the oppre&s;&s;ed pilgrims in Pale&s;tine, incited others to declare them&s;elves the patrons and avengers of injured innocence at home. When the final reduction of the Holy Land under the dominion of Infidels put an end to the&s;e foreign expe|ditions, the latter was the only employment left for the activity and courage of adventurers.

Va|lour, humanity, courte&s;y, ju&s;tice, honour, were the characteri&s;tic qualities of chivalry. To the&s;e were ad|ded religion, which mingled it&s;elf with every pa&s;&s;ion and in&s;titution during the middle ages, and by infu&s;|ing a large proportion of enthu&s;ia&s;tic zeal, gave them &s;uch force, as carried them to romantic exce&s;s. Men were trained to knighthood by a long previous di&s;ci|pline; they were admitted into the order by &s;olemni|ties no le&s;s devout than pompous, every per&s;on of noble birth courted that honour; it was deemed a di&s;|tinction &s;uperior to royalty; and monarchs were proud to receive it from the hands of private gentlemen.</P>

More gentle and poli&s;hed manners were introduced, when courte&s;y was recommended as the mo&s;t amiable of knightly virtues. Violence and oppre&s;&s;ion decrea&s;|ed, when it was reckoned meritorious to check and to puni&s;h them. A &s;crupulous adherence to truth, with the mo&s;t religious attention to fulfil every engagement, became the di&s;tingui&s;hed characteri&s;tic of a gentleman, becau&s;e chivalry was regarded as the &s;chool of honour, and inculcated the mo&s;t delicate &s;en&s;ibility with re|&s;pect to that point.

At the time when their Empire was overturned, the Romans, though they had lo&s;t that correct ta&s;te which has rendered the productions of their ance&s;tors the &s;tandards of excellence, and models for imitation to &s;ucceeding ages, &s;till pre&s;erved their love of letters, and cultivated the arts with great ardour.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ignorance of the middle ages.</NOTE> But rude barbarians were &s;o far from being &s;truck with any admiration of the&s;e unknown accompli&s;hments, that they de&s;pi&s;ed them.

interior defects in the form of government which they introduced, bani&s;hed &s;ecurity and lei&s;ure; prevented the growth of ta&s;te, or the culture of &s;cience; and kept Europe, during &s;everal centuries, in that &s;tate of ignorance which has been already de&s;cribed. But the events and in&s;titutions which I have enumerated, produced great alterations in &s;ociety. As &s;oon as their operation, in re&s;toring liberty and independence to one part of the community, began to be felt; as &s;oon as they began to communicate to all the mem|bers of &s;ociety &s;ome ta&s;te of the advantages ari&s;ing from commerce, from public order, and from per&s;onal &s;e|curity, the human mind became con&s;cious of powers which it did not formerly perceive, and fond of oc|cupations or pur&s;uits of which it was formerly incapa|ble. Towards the beginning of the twelfth century, we di&s;cern the fir&s;t &s;ymptoms of its awakening from that lethargy in which it had long been &s;unk, and ob&s;erve it turning with curio&s;ity and attention towards new objects.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t literary efforts, however,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fir&s;t li|terary efforts ill directed, and the cau&s;es of this.</NOTE> of the European nations in the middle ages, were extremely ill-directed. Among nati|ons, as well as individuals, the powers of imagination attain &s;ome degree of vigour before the intellectual faculties are much exerci&s;ed in &s;peculative or ab&s;tract di&s;qui&s;ition. Men are poets before they are philo&s;ophers. They feel with &s;en&s;ibility, and de|&s;cribe with force, when they have made but little pro|gre&s;s in inve&s;tigation or rea&s;oning. The age of Ho|mer and of He&s;iod long preceded that of Thales, or of Socrates. But, unhappily for literature, our an|ce&s;tors deviating from this cour&s;e which nature points out, plunged at once into the depths of ab&s;tru&s;e and and metaphy&s;ical inquiry. They had been converted to the Chri&s;tian faith, &s;oon after they &s;ettled in their new conque&s;ts. But they did not receive it pure. The pre&s;umption of men had added to the &s;imple and in&s;tructive doctrines of Chri&s;tianity, the theories of a vain philo&s;ophy, that attempted to penerate into my|&s;teries, and to decide que&s;tions which the limited fa|culties of the human mind are unable to comprehend,

or to re&s;olve. The&s;e over-curious &s;peculations were incorporated with the &s;y&s;tem of religion, and came to be con&s;idered as the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential part of it. As &s;oon, then, as curio&s;ity prompted men to enquire and to rea&s;on, the&s;e were the &s;ubjects which fir&s;t pre&s;ented them&s;elves, and engaged their attention. The &s;cho|la&s;tic theology, with its infinite train of bold di&s;qui&s;i|tions, and &s;ubtile di&s;tinctions concerning points which are not the object of human rea&s;on, was the fir&s;t pro|duction of the &s;pirit of enquiry after it began to re|&s;ume &s;ome degree of activity and vigour in Europe. It was not this circum&s;tance alone that gave &s;uch a wrong turn to the minds of men, when they began again to exerci&s;e talents which they had &s;o long ne|glected. Mo&s;t of the per&s;ons who attempted to revive literature in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, had received in&s;truction, or derived their principles of &s;cience from the Greeks in the Ea&s;tern Empire, or from the Arabians in Spain and Africa. Both the&s;e people, acute and inqui&s;itive to exce&s;s, corrupted tho&s;e &s;ciences which they cultivated. The former rendered theology a &s;y&s;tem of &s;peculative refinement, or of endle&s;s controver&s;y. The latter communicated to philo&s;ophy a &s;pirit of metaphy&s;ical and frivolous &s;ub|tlety. Mi&s;led by the&s;e guides, the per&s;ons who fir&s;t applied to &s;cience were involved in a maze of intricate inquiries. In&s;tead of allowing their fancy to take its natural range, and to produce &s;uch works of invention as might have improved their ta&s;te, and refined their &s;entiments; in&s;tead of cultivating tho&s;e arts which embelli&s;hed human life, and render it comfortable; they were fettered by authority, they were led a&s;tray by example, and wa&s;ted the whole force of their ge|nius in &s;peculations as unavailing as they were diffi|cult.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They had however con&s;iderable effects.</NOTE>BUT fruitle&s;s and ill-directed as the&s;e &s;pecu|lations were, their novelty rouzed, and their boldne&s;s intere&s;ted the human mind. The ardour with which men pur&s;ued the&s;e unin|viting &s;tudies, was a&s;toni&s;hing. Genuine philo&s;ophy was never cultivated, in any enlightened age, with greater zeal.

by Charlemange, were opened in every cathe|dral, and almo&s;t in every mona&s;tery of note. Colle|ges and univer&s;ities were erected, and formed into communities or corporations governed by their own laws, and inve&s;ted with &s;eparate and exten&s;ive juri&s;|diction over their own members. A regular cour&s;e of &s;tudies was planned. Privileges of great value were conferred on ma&s;ters and &s;cholars. Academical titles and honours of various kinds were invented, as a recompence for both. Nor was it in the &s;chools alone that &s;uperiority in &s;cience led to reputation and authority; it became the object of re&s;pect in life, and advanced &s;uch as acquired it to a rank of no incon&s;ide|rable eminence. Allured by all the&s;e advantages, an in|credible number of &s;tudents re&s;orted to the&s;e new &s;eats of learning, and crowded with eagerne&s;s into that new path which was opened to fame and di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>BUT how con&s;iderable &s;oever the&s;e fir&s;t efforts may appear,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A circum|&s;tance which prevented their being more exten|&s;ive.</NOTE> there was one circum|&s;tance which prevented the effects of them from being as exten&s;ive as they ought to have been. All the languages in Europe, dur|ing the period under review, were barbarous. They were de&s;titute of elegance, of force, and even of per|&s;picuity. No attempt had been hitherto made to im|prove or to poli&s;h them. The Latin tongue was con|&s;ecrated by the church to religion. Cu&s;tom with au|thority &s;carce le&s;s &s;acred, had appropriated it to lite|rature. All the &s;ciences cultivated in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, were taught in Latin. All books with re&s;pect to them were written in that language. To have treated of any important &s;ubject in a modern language, would have been deemed a degradation of it. This confined &s;cience within a very narrow cir|cle. The learned alone were admitted into the tem|ple of knowledge; the gate was &s;hut again&s;t all others, who were allowed to remain involved in their former darkne&s;s and ignorance.</P>
<P>BUT though &s;cience was thus prevented,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its influence on manners merits atten|tion.</NOTE> during &s;everal ages, from diffu&s;ing it&s;elf through &s;ociety, and its influence was cir|cum&s;cribed; the progre&s;s of it may be mentioned,

<P N="10"><NOTE PLACE="marg">The progre&s;s of commerce had great in|fluence on manners and government.</NOTE>X. THE progre&s;s of commerce had con&s;i|derable influence in poli&s;hing the manners of the European nations, and in leading them to order, equal laws, and humanity. The wants of men, in the original and mo&s;t &s;imple &s;tate of &s;ociety, are &s;o few, and their de&s;ires &s;o limited, that they re&s;t contented with the natural productions of their climate and &s;oil, or with what they can add to the&s;e by their own rude indu&s;try.

We find, accordingly, that the fir&s;t effect of the &s;ettlement of the barbarians in the Empire, was to divide tho&s;e nations which the Roman power had united. Europe was broken into many &s;eparte com|munities. The communication between the&s;e divid|ed &s;tates cea&s;ed almo&s;t totally during &s;everal centuries. Navigation was dangerous in &s;eas infe&s;ted by pirates; nor could &s;trangers tru&s;t to a friendly reception in the ports of uncivilized nations. Even between di&s;tant
<PB N="67" REF="011837_0088_0F9D8737721D6FF0">
parts of the &s;ame kingdom, the intercour&s;e was rare and difficult. The lawle&s;s rapine of banditti, to|gether with the avowed exactions of the nobles, &s;carce le&s;s formidable and oppre&s;&s;ive, rendered a journey of any length a perilous enterprize. Fixed to the &s;pot in which they re&s;ided, the greater part of the inhabi|tants of Europe lo&s;t, in a great mea&s;ure, the know|ledge of remote regions, and were unacquainted with their names, their &s;ituations, their climates, and their commodities.</P>
<P>VARIOUS cau&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cau&s;es of its revival.</NOTE> contributed to revive the &s;pirit of commerce, and to renew in &s;ome degree the intercour&s;e between different nations. The Italians, by their connection with Con&s;tantino|ple and other cities of the Greek empire, pre&s;erved in their own country &s;ome reli&s;h for the precious commodities, and curious manufactures of the Ea&s;t. They communicated &s;ome knowledge of the&s;e to the countries contiguous in Italy. This commerce, how|ever, was extremely limited, nor was the intercour&s;e con&s;iderable which it occa&s;ioned between different na|tions. The Cru&s;ades, by leading multitudes from every corner of Europe into A&s;ia, opened a more ex|ten&s;ive communication between the Ea&s;t and We&s;t, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted for two centuries; and though the object of the&s;e expeditions was conque&s;t and not com|merce; though the i&s;&s;ue of them proved as unfortu|tunate, as the motives for undertaking them were wild and enthu&s;ia&s;tic, their commercial effects, as hath been &s;hewn, were both beneficial and permanent. During the continuance of the Cru&s;ades, the great cities in Italy and in other countries of Europe acquir|ed liberty, and together with it &s;uch privileges as ren|dered them re&s;pectable and independent communities. Thus, in every &s;tate there was formed a new order of citizens, to whom commerce pre&s;ented it&s;elf as their proper object, and opened to them a certain path to wealth and dignity. Soon after the clo&s;e of the Holy war, the mariner's compa&s;s was invented, which, by rendering navigation more &s;ecure as well as more ad|ventrous, facilitated the communication between re|mote nations, and brought them nearer to each other.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="011837_0089_0F9D8738313A3410"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fir&s;t among the Italians.</NOTE>THE Italian States, during the &s;ame peri|od, e&s;tabli&s;hed a regular commerce with the Ea&s;t in the ports of Egypt, and drew from thence all the rich products of the Indies. They introduced into their own territories manufactures of various kinds, and carried them on with great ingenuity and vigour. They attempted new arts; and tran&s;planted from warmer climates, to which they had been hitherto deemed peculiar, &s;everal natural productions which now furni&s;h the materials of a lucrative and extended commerce. All the&s;e commodities, whether import|ed from A&s;ia, or produced by their own &s;kill, they di&s;po&s;ed of to great advantage among the other people of Europe, who, began to acquire &s;ome ta&s;te of ele|gance unknown to their ance&s;tors, or de&s;pi&s;ed by them. During the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the commerce of Europe was almo&s;t entirely in the hands of the Italians, more commonly known in tho&s;e ages by the name of Lombards. Companies or &s;ocieties of Lombard merchants &s;ettled in every different king|dom. They were taken under the immediate protec|tion of the &s;everal governments. They enjoyed ex|ten&s;ive privileges and immunities. The operation of the ancient barbarous laws concerning &s;trangers was &s;u&s;pended with re&s;pect to them.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Then by means of the Han|&s;eatick.</NOTE>WHILE the Italians, in the &s;outh of Eu|rope, cultivated trade with &s;uch indu&s;try and &s;ucce&s;s, the commercial &s;pirit awaken|ed in the north, towards the middle of the thirteenth century.

They derived &s;uch advantages from this union, that other towns acceded to their confederacy, and, in a &s;hort time, eighty of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable cities &s;cattered through tho&s;e va&s;t countries which &s;tretch from the bottom of the Bal|tick to Cologne on the Rhine, joined in the famous

Han&s;eatick league, which became &s;o formidable, that its alliance was courted, and its enmity was dreaded by the greate&s;t monarchs. The members of this pow|erful a&s;&s;ociation formed the fir&s;t &s;y&s;tematick plan of commerce known in the middle ages, and conducted it by common laws enacted in their general a&s;&s;emblies. They &s;upplied the re&s;t of Europe with naval &s;tores, and pitched on different towns, the mo&s;t eminent of which was Bruges in Flanders, where they e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;taples in which their commerce was regularly carried on. Thither the Lombards brought the pro|ductions of India, together with the manufactures of Italy, and exchanged them for the more bulky, but not le&s;s u&s;eful commodities of the North. The Han|&s;eatick merchants di&s;po&s;ed of the cargoes which they received from the Lombards, in the ports of the Bal|tick, or carried them up the great rivers into the in|terior parts of Germany.</P>
<P>THIS regular intercour&s;e opened between the North and South of Europe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Commerce makes pro|gre&s;s in the Netherlands.</NOTE> made them &s;en&s;ible of their mutual wants, and created &s;uch new and va&s;t demands for commodities of every kind, that it excited among the inhabitants of the Netherlands a more vigorous &s;pirit in carrying on the two great manufactures of wool and flax, which &s;eem to have been con&s;iderable in that country as far back as the age of Charlemagne. As Bruges became the centre of communication between the Lombard and Han&s;eatick merchants, the Flemings traded with both in that city to &s;uch extent as well as advantage, as &s;pread among them a general habit of indu&s;try, which long rendered Flanders and the adjacent pro|vinces the mo&s;t opulent, the mo&s;t populous, and be&s;t cultivated countries in Europe.</P>
<P>STRUCK with the flouri&s;hing &s;tate of the&s;e provinces,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And in En|gland</NOTE> of which he di&s;cerned the true cau&s;e, Edward III. of England endeavoured to excite a &s;pirit of indu&s;try among his own &s;ubjects, who, blind to the advantages of their &s;ituation, and ignorant of the &s;ource from which opulence was de|&s;tined to &s;low into their country, totally neglected commerce, and did not even attempt tho&s;e manufac|tures,

They are excited to act not by the di&s;tant objects, and &s;ubtile &s;pecula|tions which intere&s;t or affect men in poli&s;hed &s;ocie|ties, but by their pre&s;ent feelings. The in&s;ults of an enemy kindle re&s;entment; the &s;ucce&s;s of a rival tribe awakens emulation; the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions communicate from brea&s;t to brea&s;t, and all the members of the communi|ty, with united ardour, ru&s;h into the field in order to gratify their revenge, or to acquire di&s;tinction. But in widely extended &s;tates, &s;uch as the great kingdoms of Europe at the beginning of the fifteenth century, where there is little intercour&s;e between the di&s;tant members of the community, and where every great enterprize requires previous concert and long prepa|ration, nothing can rou&s;e and call forth their united &s;trength, but the ab&s;olute command of a De&s;pot, or the powerful influence of regular policy.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The power of Monarchs very limited</NOTE>BUT, at the opening of the fifteenth cen|tury, the political con&s;titution in all the kingdoms of Europe was very different from either of the&s;e &s;tates of government.

To the &s;tability and di&s;cipline of their legions, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of infantry, the Romans during the times of the republick were indebted for all their victories; and when their de&s;cendants, forgetting the in&s;tituti|ons which had led them to univer&s;al dominion, &s;o far altered their military &s;y&s;tem as to place their principal confidence in a numerous cavalry, the undi&s;ciplined impetuo&s;ity of the barbarous nations who fought mo&s;tly on foot, was &s;ufficient, as I have already ob|&s;erved, to overcome them. The&s;e nations &s;oon after they &s;ettled in their new conque&s;ts, unin&s;tructed by the fatal error of the Romans, relinqui&s;hed the cu&s;|toms of their ance&s;tors and converted the chief force of their armies into cavalry. Among the Romans this change was occa&s;ioned by the effeminacy of their troops, who could not endure the fatigues of &s;ervice,

There were only two propo&s;itions, however, which he could make with propriety. The one was the marriage of the Dauphin, the other that of the Count of Angouleme, a Prince of the blood, with the heire&s;s of Burgundy. By the former, he would have annexed all her territories to his crown, and have rendered France at once the mo&s;t re&s;pectable monarchy in Europe.

But Louis had been accu&s;tomed &s;o long to the intricacies of a crook|ed and in&s;idious policy, that he could not be &s;atisfied with what was obvious and &s;imple; and was &s;o fond of artifice and refinement, that he came to con&s;ider the&s;e as his ultimate object, not as the means only of conducting affairs.

They quickly perceived that no &s;ingle power, which they could rou&s;e to action, was an equal match for a monarch, who ruled over &s;uch exten&s;ive territories, and was at the head of &s;uch a martial people; but that a confederacy might ac|compli&s;h what the &s;eparate members of it dur&s;t not at|tempt. To this expedient, the only one that remain|ed to deliver or to pre&s;erve them from the yoke, they had recour&s;e. While Charles incon&s;iderately wa&s;ted his time at Naples, in fe&s;tivals and triumphs on account of his pa&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;es, or was fondly dreaming of fu|ture conque&s;ts in the Ea&s;t, to the empire of which he now a&s;pired, they formed again&s;t him a powerful com|bination of almo&s;t all the Italian &s;tates, &s;upported by the Emperor Maximilian, and Ferdinand King of Ara|gon. The union of &s;o many powers, who &s;u&s;pended or forgot all their particular animo&s;ities, that they might act with concert again&s;t an enemy who had be|come formidable to them all, awakened Charles from his thoughtle&s;s &s;ecurity. He &s;aw now no pro&s;pect of &s;afety but in returning to France. An army of thirty thou&s;and men, a&s;&s;embled by the allies, was ready to ob&s;truct his march; and though the French, with a daring courage, which more than counterbalanced their inferiority in number, broke through that great body, and gained a victory, which opened to their monarch a &s;afe pa&s;&s;age into his own territories, he was &s;tripped of all his conque&s;ts in Italy in as &s;hort a time as it had co&s;t him to acquire them; and the poli|tical &s;y&s;tem in that country re&s;umed the &s;ame appear|ance as before his inva&s;ion.</P>

As Rome had &s;o long been the &s;eat of empire, and capital of the world, its bi&s;hops were upon that account entitled to re&s;pect; they received it; but during &s;everal ages they claimed and received nothing more. From the&s;e hum|ble beginnings, they advanced with &s;uch an adventu|rous and well-directed ambition, that they e&s;tabli&s;hed a &s;piritual dominion over the minds and &s;entiments of men, to which all Europe &s;ubmitted with implicit obe|dience. Their claim of univer&s;al juri&s;diction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Origin and progre&s;s of the Papal power.</NOTE> as heads of the church, and their pretentions to infallibility in their deci&s;ions, as &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of St. Peter, are as chimerical, as they are repugnant to the genius of the Chri&s;tian religion. But on the&s;e foundations, the &s;uper&s;tition and credulity of mankind enabled them to erect an amazing &s;uper&s;truc|ture. In all eccle&s;ia&s;tical controver&s;ies, their deci&s;ions were received as the infallible oracles of truth. Nor was the plenitude of their power confined to the&s;e alone; they dethroned monarchs; di&s;po&s;ed of crowns; ab&s;olv|ed &s;ubjects from the obedience due to their &s;overeigns; and laid kingdoms under interdicts. There was not a &s;tate in Europe which had not been di&s;quieted by their ambition. There was not a throne which they had not &s;haken; nor a Prince, who did not tremble at their power.</P>

<P>MANY attempts were made by the Popes, not only to humble the&s;e u&s;urpers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alexander VI. and Ju|lius II. ren|der the Popes con|&s;iderable Princes.</NOTE> who lorded it over the cities in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate, but to break the turbulent &s;pirit of the Roman people.

their country was better cultivated, and more po|pulous; and as they drew large contributions from every part of Europe, their revenues far exceeded tho&s;e of the neighbouring powers, and rendered them capable of more &s;udden and vigorous efforts.</P>
<P>THE genius of the Papal government, however, was better adapted to the exerci&s;e of &s;piritual do|minion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Defects in the nature of eccle&s;i|a&s;tical do|minion.</NOTE> than of temporal power. With re|&s;pect to the former, all its maxims were &s;teady and invariable. Every new Pontiff adopted the plan of his predece&s;&s;or. By education and habit eccle&s;ia&s;tics were &s;o formed, that the charac|ter of the individual was &s;unk in that of the profe&s;&s;ion; and the pa&s;&s;ions of the man were &s;acrificed to the intere&s;t and honour of the order. The hands which held the reins of admini&s;tration might change; but the &s;pirit which conducted them was always the &s;ame. While the mea&s;ures of other governments fluctuated, and the ob|jects at which they aimed varied, the church kept one end in view; and to this unrelaxing con&s;tancy of pur|&s;uit, it was indebted for its &s;ucce&s;s in the bolde&s;t attempts ever made by human ambition.</P>
<P>BUT in their civil admini&s;tration, the Popes followed no &s;uch uniform or con&s;i&s;tent plan. There&punc; as in other governments, the character, the pa&s;&s;ions, and the inte|re&s;ts of the per&s;on who had the &s;upreme direction of affairs, occa&s;ioned a variation both in objects and mea|&s;ures. As few prelates reached the &s;ummit of eccle&s;i|a&s;tical dignity, until they were far advanced in life, a change of ma&s;ters was more frequent in the Papal do|minions than in other &s;tates; and the political &s;y&s;tem was, of cour&s;e, le&s;s &s;table and permanent. Every Pope was eager to make the mo&s;t of the &s;hort period, during which he had the pro&s;pect of enjoying power, in order to aggrandize his family, and to attain his private ends; and it was often the fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or to undo all that he had done, and to overturn what he had e&s;ta|bli&s;hed.</P>
<P>AS eccle&s;ia&s;tics were trained to pacific arts, and early initiated in the my&s;teries of that policy, by which the court of Rome extended or &s;upported its &s;piritual do|minion, the Popes were apt to conduct their temporal

affairs with the &s;ame &s;pirit; and in all their mea&s;ures were more ready to employ the refinements of intrigue, than the force of arms. It was in the Papal court that addre&s;s and &s;ubtilty in negotiation fir&s;t became a &s;cience; and, during the &s;ixteenth century, Rome was con&s;ider|ed as the &s;chool in which it could be be&s;t acquired.</P>
<P>AS the decorum of their eccle&s;ia&s;tical character pre|vented the Popes from placing them&s;elves at the head of their armies, or taking the command, in per&s;on, of the military force in their dominions, they were afraid to arm their &s;ubjects; and in all their operations, whether offen|&s;ive or defen&s;ive, they tru&s;ted intirely to mercenary troops.</P>
<P>AS their power and dominions could not de&s;cend to their po&s;terity, the Popes were le&s;s &s;olicitous than other princes to form or to encourage &s;chemes of public uti|lity and improvement. Their tenure was only for a &s;hort life; pre&s;ent advantage was all that they attended to; to &s;queeze and to ama&s;s, not to meliorate, was their ob|ject. They erected, perhaps, &s;ome work of o&s;tentation, to remain as a monument of their pontificate; they found it nece&s;&s;ary, at &s;ome times, to e&s;tabli&s;h u&s;eful in&s;titu|tions, in order to &s;ooth and &s;ilence the turbulent popu|lace of Rome; but plans of general benefit to their &s;ubjects, and framed with a view to futurity, were rarely objects of attention in the papal policy. The patrimo|ny of St. Peter was wor&s;e governed than any part of Europe; and though a generous Pontiff might &s;u&s;pend for a little, or counter-act the effects of tho&s;e vices which are peculiar to the admini&s;tration of eccle&s;ia&s;tics; the di&s;ea&s;e not only remained incurable, but has even gone on increa&s;ing from age to age; and the decline of the &s;tate has kept pace with its progre&s;s.</P>

<P>THE &s;pirit of government, in a commonwealth of this &s;pecies, was, of cour&s;e, timid and jea|lous.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Defects in its govern|ment, par|ticularly with re&s;pect to its mili|tary opera|tions.</NOTE> The Venetian nobles di&s;tru&s;ted their own &s;ubjects, and were afraid of allowing them the u&s;e of arms.

The military force of the republic con&s;i&s;ted intirely of foreign mercenaries. The command of the&s;e was never tru&s;ted to noble Venetians, le&s;t they &s;hould acquire &s;uch influ|ence over the army, as might endanger the public li|berty; or become accu&s;tomed to the exerci&s;e of &s;uch power, as would make them unwilling to return to the condition of private citizens. A &s;oldier of fortune was placed at the head of the armies of the commonwealth; and to obtain that honour, was the great object of the Italian Condottieri, or leaders of bands, who, in the fifteenth and &s;ixteenth centuries, made a trade of war, and rai&s;ed and hired out &s;oldiers to different &s;tates. But the &s;ame &s;u&s;picious policy, which induced them to em|ploy the&s;e adventurers, prevented their placing intire confidence in them.

The appearance of republican government &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted, the people were pa&s;&s;ionately attached to it, and on &s;ome occa&s;ions contended warmly for their privi|leges, and yet they permitted a &s;ingle family to a&s;&s;ume a direction of their affairs, almo&s;t as ab&s;olute as if it had been formally inve&s;ted with &s;overeign power.

of the Florentines, in putting the military force of the republic upon the &s;ame footing with that of the other Italian &s;tates.

<P>IN the kingdom of Naples, to which the &s;overeignty of the i&s;land of Sicily was annexed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The con&s;ti|tution of the king|dom of Naples.</NOTE> the feu|dal government was e&s;tabli&s;hed in the &s;ame form, and with the &s;ame defects, as in the other nations of Europe. The frequent and violent revolutions which happened in that monarchy, had con&s;iderably increa&s;ed the&s;e defects, and rendered them more intolerable. The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown of Naples had been &s;o often interrupted or alter|ed, and &s;o many princes of foreign blood had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne, that the Neapolitan nobility had lo&s;t, in a great mea&s;ure, that attachment to the fa|mily of their &s;overeigns, as well as that reverence for their per&s;ons, which, in other feudal kingdoms, con|tributed to &s;et &s;ome bounds to the encroachments of the barons upon the royal prerogative and power. At the &s;ame time, the different pretenders to the crown, being obliged to court the barons who adhered to them, and on who&s;e &s;upport they depended for the &s;ucce&s;s of their claims, they augmented their privileges by liberal con|ce&s;&s;ions, and connived at their bolde&s;t u&s;urpations. Even when &s;eated on the throne, it was dangerous for a prince, who held his &s;ceptre by a di&s;puted title, to venture on any &s;tep towards extending his own power, or circum|&s;cribing that of the nobles.</P>
<P>FROM all the&s;e cau&s;es, the kingdom of Naples was the mo&s;t turbulent of any in Europe, and the authority of its monarchs the lea&s;t exten&s;ive. Though Ferdinand I. who began his reign in the year one thou&s;and four hundred and &s;ixty-eight, attempted to break the power of the ari&s;tocracy; though his &s;on Alfon&s;o, that he might cru&s;h it at once by cutting off the leaders of greate&s;t re|putation and influence among the Neapolitan barons, ventured to commit one of the mo&s;t perfidious and cruel actions recorded in hi&s;tory; the order of nobles was, ne|verthele&s;s,

Manfred, his natural &s;on, a&s;piring to the Neapolitan throne, mur|dered if we may believe contemporary hi&s;to|rians) his brother the Emperor Conrad, and by that crime obtained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Struv. corp. hi&s;t.

The Popes, from their implacable enmity to the hou&s;e of Swabia, not only refu&s;ed to recognize Manfred's title, but endea|voured to excite again&s;t him &s;ome rival capable of wre&s;t|ing the &s;ceptre out of his hand. Charles Count of An|jou, the brother of St. Louis King of France, under|took this; and he received from the Popes, the inve&s;|titure of the kingdom of Naples and Sicily, as a fief held of the Holy See. The Count of Anjou's efforts were crowned with &s;ucce&s;s; Manfred fell in battle; and he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the vacant throne. But &s;oon after, Charles &s;ullied the glory which he had acquired, by the inju&s;tice and cruelty with which he put to death, by the hands of the executioner, Conradin, the la&s;t prince of the hou&s;e of Swabia, and the rightful heir of the Nea|politan crown. That gallant young prince a&s;&s;erted his title, to the la&s;t, with a courage worthy of a better fate. On the &s;caffold he declared Peter, at that time Prince, and &s;oon after King of Aragon, who had married Man|fred's only daughter, his heir; and throwing his glove among the people, he entreated that it might be carried to Peter, as the &s;ymbol by which he conveyed all his

The de&s;ire of avenging the in&s;ult of|fered to royalty by the death of Conradin, concurred with ambition, in prompting Peter to take arms in &s;up|port of the title, which he had acquired. From that period, during almo&s;t two centuries, the hou&s;es of Ara|gon and Anjou contended for the crown of Naples. Amid&s;t a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of revolutions more rapid, as well as of crimes more atrocious, than what occur in the hi&s;tory of almo&s;t any other kingdom, monarchs, &s;ome|times of the Aragone&s;e line, and &s;ometimes of the An|gevin, were &s;eated on the throne.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A.D. 1434.</NOTE> At length the princes of the hou&s;e of Aragon obtained &s;uch firm po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this long-di&s;puted inheritance, that they tran&s;mitted it quietly to a ba&s;tard branch of their family <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Giannone, Book xxvi. ch. 2.</NOTE>.</P>

France, among other expedients for rai&s;ing money, which the calamities of his reign obliged him to employ, conde&s;cended to give one of his daughters in marriage to John Galeazzo Vi&s;conti the fir&s;t Duke of Milan, from whom he had received con&s;iderable &s;ums. Valentine Vi&s;conti one of the children of this marriage married her cou&s;in, Louis Duke of Orleans, the only brother of Charles VI. In their marriage-contract which the Pope confirmed, it was &s;tipulated that, upon failure of heirs-male in the family of Vi&s;conti, the dutchy of Mi|lan &s;hould de&s;cend to the po&s;terity of Valentine and the Duke of Orleans. That event took place. In the year one thou&s;and four hundred and forty-&s;even, Philip Ma|ria the la&s;t Prince of the ducal family of Vi&s;conti died. Various competitors pretend to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Charles Duke of Orleans pleaded his right to it, founded on the marriage-contract of his mother Valentine Vi&s;conti. Alfon&s;o King of Naples claimed it in con&s;equenee of a will made by Philip Maria in his favour. The Em|peror contended that upon the extinction of male i&s;|&s;ue in the family of Vi&s;conti the fief returned to the &s;u|perior Lord, and ought to be re-annexed to the Em|pire.

<P>BUT during the &s;truggle among &s;o many competi|tors, the prize for which they contended was &s;eized by one from whom none of them apprehended any danger. Francis Sforza, the natural &s;on of Jacomuzzo Sforza, whom his courage and abilities had elevated from the rank of a pea&s;ant to be one of the mo&s;t eminent and powerful of the Italian <HI>Condottieri,</HI> having &s;ucceeded his father in the command of the adventurers who fol|lowed his &s;tandard, had married a natural daughter of the la&s;t Duke of Milan. Upon this &s;hadow of a title Francis founded his preten&s;ions to the dutchy, which he &s;upported with &s;uch talents and valour as placed him at la&s;t on the ducal throne.

<P>LOUIS XI. who took plea&s;ure in depre&s;&s;ing the Princes of the blood, and who admired the political abilities of Francis Sforza, would not permit the Duke of Orleans to take any &s;tep in pro&s;ecution of his right to the dut|chy of Milan. Ludovico the Moor kept up &s;uch a clo&s;e connection with Charles VIII. that during the greater part of his reign, the claim of the family of Orleans continued to lie dormant. But when the crown of France devolved to Louis XII. Duke of Orleans, he in|&s;tantly a&s;&s;erted the rights of his family with the ardour which it was natural to expect. Ludovico Sforza, in|capable of contending with &s;uch a rival, was &s;tripped of all his dominions in the &s;pace of a few days. The King, clad in the ducal robes, entered Milan in triumph; and &s;oon after, Ludovico having been betrayed by the Swi&s;s in his pay, was &s;ent a pri&s;oner into France, and &s;hut up in the ca&s;tle of Loches, where he lay unpitied during the remainder of his days. In con&s;equence of one of the &s;ingular revolutions which occur &s;o frequently in the hi&s;tory of the Milane&s;e, his &s;on Maximilian Sforza was placed on the ducal throne, of which he kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion during the reign of Louis XII.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A.

<P>IT is unnece&s;&s;ary to enter into any detail with re&s;pect to the form of government in Genoa, Parma, Modena, and the other inferior States of Italy.

Several circum&s;tances contri|buted to &s;ecure this permanence of the feudal in&s;titutions in Spain, notwith&s;tanding the conque&s;t of the Moors, which &s;eemed to have overturned them. Such of the Spaniards, as pre&s;erved their independance, adhered to their ancient cu&s;toms not only from attach|ment to them, but out of antipathy to the Moors, to who&s;e ideas concerning property and government the&s;e cu&s;toms were &s;o totally repugnant. Even among the Chri&s;tians, who &s;ubmitted to the Moori&s;h conquerors, and con&s;ented to become their &s;ubjects, antient cu&s;toms were not entirely aboli&s;hed. They were permitted to retain their religion; their laws concerning private pro|perty; their forms of admini&s;tering ju&s;tice; and their mode of levying taxes. The followers of Mahomet are the only enthu&s;ia&s;ts, who have united the &s;pirit of to|leration with zeal for making pro&s;elytes, and who, at the &s;ame time that they took arms to propagate the doc|trine of their prophet, permitted &s;uch as would not em|brace it to adhere to their own tenets, and to practi&s;e their own rites. To this peculiarity in the genius of
<PB N="118" REF="011837_0145_0F9D8765330ED8B8">
the Mahometan religion, as well as to the de&s;ire of the Moors to reconcile the Chri&s;tians to their yoke, it was owing that the ancient manners and laws in Spain &s;ur|vived the violent &s;hock of a conque&s;t, and continued to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, notwith&s;tanding the introduction of a new re|ligion and a new form of government into that coun|try. It is obvious from all the&s;e particulars, that the Chri&s;tians mu&s;t have found it extremely ea&s;y to re|e&s;tabli&s;h manners and government on their ancient foun|dations, in tho&s;e provinces of Spain, which they wre&s;ted &s;ucce&s;&s;ively from the Moors. A con&s;iderable part of the people retained &s;uch a fondne&s;s for the cu&s;toms, and &s;uch a reverence for the laws of their ance&s;tors, that they wi&s;hed to &s;ee them re&s;tored with full authority, and were not only willing but eager to ob&s;erve the former, and to recognize the authority of the latter.</P>
<P>BUT though the feudal form of government, with all the in&s;titutions that characterize it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Certain pe|culiarities in their con&s;titution and laws.</NOTE> was thus pre&s;erved entire in Ca&s;tile and Aragon, as well as in all the kingdoms which depend|ed on the&s;e crowns, there were certain pecu|liarities in their political con&s;titutions which di&s;tingui&s;h them from tho&s;e of any other country in Eu|rope. The regal prerogative, extremely limited in eve|ry feudal kingdom, was circum&s;cribed, in Spain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The prero|gative more limited, and the immu|nities of the people more exten&s;ive.</NOTE> within &s;uch narrow bounds, as re|duced the power of the Sovereign almo&s;t to nothing.

The executive part of government was committed to the King, but with a prerogative extremely limited. The legi&s;lative authority re&s;ided in the Cortes, which was compo&s;ed of the nobility, the dignified eccle&s;ia&s;ticks, and the repre&s;entatives of the cities. The a&s;&s;embly of the Cortes in Ca&s;tile was very ancient, and &s;eems to have been coeval with the con&s;titution. The members of the three different orders, who had a right of &s;uf|frage, met in one place, and deliberated as one col|lective body; the deci&s;ions of which were regulated by the &s;entiments of the majority. The right of impo&s;ing taxes, of enacting laws, and of redre&s;&s;ing grievances belonged to this a&s;&s;embly; and in order to &s;ecure the a&s;&s;ent of the King to &s;uch &s;tatutes and regulations, as were deemed &s;alutary or beneficial to the kingdom, it was u&s;ual in the Cortes, to take no &s;tep towards grant|ing money, until all bu&s;ine&s;s relative to the publick welfare was concluded.

It was compo&s;ed of an equal number of noblemen, and of deputies cho&s;en by the cities; the latter were ad|mitted to the &s;ame rank, and inve&s;ted with the &s;ame powers, as prelates and grandees of the fir&s;t order <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Marian. hi&s;t lib. 18. c. 15.</NOTE>. But though the members of communities in Ca&s;tile were elevated above the condition wherein they were placed in other kingdoms of Europe; though they had attained to &s;uch political importance, that even the proud and jealous &s;pirit of the feudal ari&s;tocracy could not exclude them from &s;ome &s;hare of government; yet the nobles, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e acqui&s;itions of the commons, continued to a&s;&s;ert the privileges of their or|der, in oppo&s;ition to the crown, in a tone extremely high. There was not any body of nobility in Eu|rope more di&s;tingui&s;hed for independance of &s;pirit, haughtine&s;s of deportment, and bold preten&s;ions, than that of Ca&s;tile. The hi&s;tory of that monarchy affords the mo&s;t &s;triking examples of the vigilance with which they ob&s;erved, and of the vigour with which they op|po&s;ed every &s;cheme of their Kings, that tended to en|croach on their juri&s;diction, to dimini&s;h their dignity, or to abridge their power. Even in their ordinary in|tercour&s;e with their Monarchs, they pre&s;erved &s;uch a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their rank, that the nobles of the fir&s;t order claimed it as a privilege to be covered in the royal pre&s;ence, and approached their &s;overeigns rather as equals than as &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>THE con&s;titution of the &s;ubordinate monarchies, which depended on the crowns of Ca&s;tile and Aragon, nearly re&s;embled that of the kingdom to which they were annexed.

<P><PB N="125" REF="011837_0152_0F9D876A7101C6C0">AS the provinces of Spain were wre&s;ted from the Mahometans gradually and with difficulty, the nobles, who followed the &s;tandard of any eminent leader in the&s;e wars, conquered not for him alone, but for them&s;elves. They claimed a &s;hare in the lands which their valour had torn from the enemy, and their pro&s;perity and power increa&s;ed, in proportion as the territory of the Prince extended.</P>
<P>DURING their perpetual wars with the Moors, the Monarchs of Spain depended &s;o much on their nobles, that it became nece&s;&s;ary to conciliate their good will by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive grants of new honours and privileges. By the time that any Prince could e&s;tabli&s;h his dominion in a conquered province, the greater part of the pro|perty was parcelled out by him among his barons, with &s;uch juri&s;diction and immunities as rai&s;ed them almo&s;t to &s;overeign power.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time, the kingdoms erected in &s;o many different corners of Spain were extremely incon&s;iderable. The petty Monarch was but litttle elevated above his nobles.

The Kings of &s;uch limited do|mains could neither command much re&s;pect, nor po&s;|&s;e&s;s great power; and noblemen, &s;o nearly on the &s;ame level, could not look up to them with that reverence, with which the &s;overeigns of the great monarchies in Europe were viewed by their &s;ubjects <NOTE N="[KK]" PLACE="foot">NOTE XXXIII.</NOTE>.</P>

an enemy who&s;e operations were conducted with regular and per&s;evering vigour. Cities, in which great numbers united for their mutual defence, were the only places to which people could retire with any pro&s;pect of &s;afety. To this was owing the rapid growth of tho&s;e cities in Spain of which the Chri&s;tians recovered po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. All who fled from the Moori&s;h yoke re&s;orted to them, as to an a&s;ylum; and there, the greater part of tho&s;e, who took the field again&s;t the Mahometans, e&s;tabli&s;hed their families.</P>
<P>EACH of the&s;e cities, during a longer or &s;horter cour&s;e of years, was the capital of a little &s;tate, and en|joyed all the advantages, which accelerate the increa&s;e of inhabitants in every place that is the &s;eat of govern|ment.</P>
<P>THE number of cities in Spain, at the beginning of the fifteenth century, was con&s;iderable, and they were peopled far beyond the proportion which was common in other parts of Europe, except in Italy and the Low-Countries. The Moors had introduced manufactures into the&s;e cities, while under their dominion. The Chri&s;tians, who, by intermixture with them, had learned their arts, continued to cultivate the&s;e. The trade of &s;everal of the Spani&s;h towns appears to have ben con|&s;iderable; and the &s;pirit of commerce continued to pre|&s;erve the number of their inhabitants, as the &s;en&s;e of danger had fir&s;t induced them to crowd together.</P>
<P>AS the Spani&s;h cities were populous, many of the in|habitants were of a rank &s;uperior to tho&s;e who re&s;ided in towns in other countries of Europe. That cau&s;e which contributed chiefly to their population, affected equally per&s;ons of every condition, who flocked thither promi&s;cuou&s;ly, in order to find &s;helter, or in hopes of making a &s;tand there again&s;t the enemy, with greater advantage than in any other &s;tation. The per&s;ons elect|ed as their repre&s;entatives in the Cortes by the cities, or promoted to offices of tru&s;t and dignity in the govern|ment of the community, were often, as will appear from tran&s;actions which I &s;hall hereafter relate, of &s;uch con|&s;iderable rank in the kingdom, as reflected lu&s;tre on their con&s;tituents, and on the &s;tations wherein they were placed.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="011837_0154_0F9D876BF0F14430">AS it was impo&s;&s;ible to carry on a continual war a|gain&s;t the Moors, without &s;ome other military force, than that which the barons were obliged to bring into the field, in con&s;equence of the feudal tenures, it be|became nece&s;&s;ary to have &s;ome troops, particularly a body of light cavalry, in con&s;tant pay.

The ince&s;&s;ant depredations of the Moors, the want of

di&s;cipline among the troops which were employed to oppo&s;e them, the frequent civil wars between the crown and the nobility, as well as the undi&s;cerning rage with which the barons carried on their private wars with each other, filled all the provinces of Spain with di&s;order. Rapine, outrage, and murder, became &s;o common, as not only to interrupt commerce, but in a great mea&s;ure to &s;u&s;pend all intercour&s;e between one place and another. That &s;ecurity and protection which men expect from en|tering into civil &s;ociety cea&s;ed almo&s;t totally. Interior order and police, while the feudal in&s;titutions remained in vigour, were &s;o little objects of attention, and the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice was &s;o extremely feeble, that it would have been in vain to have expected relief from the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws or the ordinary judges. But the evil became &s;o intolerable, and the inhabitants of cities, who were the chief &s;ufferers, grew &s;o impatient of this anarchy, that &s;elf pre&s;ervation forced them to have re|cour&s;e to an extraordinary remedy.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1260.</NOTE> About the middle of the thirteenth century, the cities in the kingdom of Aragon, and after their example tho&s;e in Ca&s;tile, formed them&s;elves into an a&s;&s;ociation, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of the <HI>Holy Brotherhood.</HI> They exacted a certain contribution from each of the a&s;&s;ociated towns; they levied a con&s;iderable body of troops, in order to protect travellers, and to pur&s;ue criminals; they appointed judges, who opened their courts in va|rious parts of the kingdom. Whoever was guilty of murder, robbery, or of any act that violated the publick peace, and was &s;eized by the troops of the <HI>Brotherhood,</HI> was carried before their own judges, who, without pay|ing any regard to the exclu&s;ive and &s;overeign juri&s;diction which the lord of the place might claim, tried and con|demned the criminals. By means of this, the prompt and impartial admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice was re&s;tored; and together with it, internal tranquillity and order began to return. The nobles alone murmured at this &s;alutary in&s;titution. They complained of it as an encroachment on one of their mo&s;t valuable privileges. They remon|&s;trated again&s;t it in an high tone; and, on &s;ome occa|&s;ions, refu&s;ed to grant any aid to the crown, unle&s;s it were aboli&s;hed. Ferdinand, however, was &s;en&s;ible not

only of the good effects of the Holy Brotherhood with re&s;pect to the police of his kingdoms, but perceived its tendency to abridge, and at length to annihilate the ter|ritorial juri&s;diction of the nobility. He countenanced the in&s;titution on every occa&s;ion. He &s;upported it with the whole force of royal authority; and be&s;ides the ex|pedients employed by him in common with the other monarchs of Europe, be availed him&s;elf of this in&s;titu|tion, which was peculiar to his kingdom, in order to limit and aboli&s;h that independant juri&s;diction of the no|bility, which was no le&s;s incon&s;i&s;tent with the authority of the Prince, than with the order of &s;ociety <NOTE N="[NN]" PLACE="foot">NOTE XXXVI.</NOTE>.</P>

The &s;pirit of liberty was vigorous among the people of Spain; the &s;pirit of independance was high among the nobility; and though the love of glory, peculiar to the Spaniards in every period of their hi&s;tory, prompted them to &s;upport Ferdinand with zeal in his foreign ope|rations, and to afford him &s;uch aid as enabled him not only to undertake but to execute great enterprizes; he reigned over his &s;ubjects with a juri&s;diction le&s;s exten|&s;ive than that of any of the great monarchs in Europe. It will appear from many pa&s;&s;ages in the following hi&s;|tory, that, during a con&s;iderable part of the reign of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or Charles V. the prerogative of the Spani&s;h crown was equally circum&s;cribed.</P>

The General A&s;&s;emblies of the nation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Power of the General A&s;&s;emblies under the fir&s;t race of Kings.</NOTE> which met annually at &s;tated &s;ea&s;ons, extended their authority to every department of govern|ment.

The right of determining which of the royal family &s;hould be placed on the throne was ve&s;ted in them. The mo|narchs elected by their &s;uffrage were accu&s;tomed regu|larly to call and to con&s;ult them with re&s;pect to every affair of importance to the &s;tate, and without their con|&s;ent no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> was pa&s;&s;ed, and no new tax was levied.</P>
<P>BUT, by the time that Hugh Capet, the father of the third race of Kings, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne of France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Under the third.</NOTE> &s;uch changes had happened in the political &s;tate of the kingdom, as con|&s;iderably affected the power and juri&s;diction of the ge|neral a&s;&s;embly of the nation. The royal authority in the hands of the degenerate po&s;terity of Charlemagne, had dwindled into in&s;ignificance and contempt. Every con&s;iderable proprietor of land had formed his terri|tory into a barony, almo&s;t independant of the &s;ove|reign. The dukes or governors of provinces, the counts or governors of towns and &s;mall di&s;tricts, and the
<PB N="133" REF="011837_0160_0F9D877072AB15A8">
great officers of the crown, had rendered the&s;e dignities, originally granted only during plea&s;ure or for life, here|ditary in their families. Each of the&s;e had u&s;urped all the rights which hitherto had been deemed the di&s;tinc|tions of royalty, particularly the privileges of di&s;pen&s;ing ju&s;tice within their own domains, of coining money, and of waging war. Every di&s;trict was governed by local cu&s;toms, acknowledged a di&s;tinct lord, and pur&s;ued a &s;eparate intere&s;t. The formality of doing homage to their &s;overeign, was almo&s;t the only act of &s;ubjection which haughty barons would perform, and that bound them no farther than they were willing to acknowledge its obligation <NOTE N="[OO]" PLACE="foot">NOTE XXXVII.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN a kingdom broken into &s;o many independant ba|ronies, hardly any common principle of union remained;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The power of the Ge|neral A&s;|&s;embly le&s;s con&s;iderable and exten|&s;ive.</NOTE> and the general a&s;&s;embly in its de|liberations could &s;carce con&s;ider the nation as forming one body, or e&s;tabli&s;h common re|gulations to be of equal force in every part. Within the immediate domains of the crown the king might publi&s;h laws, and they were obeyed, be|cau&s;e there he was acknowledged as the only lord. But if he had aimed at rendering the&s;e general, that would have alarmed the barons as an encroachment upon the independance of their juri&s;diction. The barons, with no le&s;s care, avoided the enacting of general laws, be|cau&s;e the execution of them mu&s;t have been ve&s;ted in the King, and would have enlarged that paramount power which was the object of their jealou&s;y. Thus, under the de&s;cendants of Hugh Capet, the States Gene|ral (for that was the name by which the &s;upreme a&s;&s;emb|ly of the French nation came then to be di&s;tingui&s;hed) lo&s;t their legi&s;lative authority, or at lea&s;t entirely relin|qui&s;hed the exerci&s;e of it. From that period, the juri&s;|diction of the States General extended no farther than to the impo&s;ition of new taxes, the determination of que&s;|tions with re&s;pect to the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown, the &s;ettling of the regency when the preceeding mo|narch had not fixed it by his will, and the pre&s;enting

<P>AS, during &s;everal centuries, the monarchs of Eu|rope &s;eldom demanded extraordinary &s;ub&s;idies of their &s;ubjects, and the other events which required the interpo&s;ition of the States, rarely occurred, their meet|ings in France were not frequent. They were &s;ummon|ed occa&s;ionally by their Kings, when compelled by their wants or by their fears to have recour&s;e to their aid; but they did not, like the Diet in Germany, the Cortes in Spain, or the Parliament in England, form an e&s;&s;en|tial member of the con&s;titution, the regular exertion of who&s;e powers was requi&s;ite to give vigour and order to government.</P>
<P>WHEN the &s;tates of France cea&s;ed to exerci&s;e legi&s;la|tive authority,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The crown begins to acquire le|gi&s;lative au|thority,</NOTE> the Kings began to a&s;&s;ume it. They ventured at fir&s;t on acts of legi&s;lation with great re&s;erve; and after taking every precaution that could prevent their &s;ubjects from being alarmed at the exerci&s;e of a new power. They did not at once i&s;&s;ue their ordinances in a tone of authority and command. They treated with their &s;ubjects; they pointed out what was be&s;t; and al|lured them to comply with it. By degrees, however, as the prerogative of the crown extended, and as the &s;u|preme juri&s;diction of the royal courts came to be e&s;tab|li&s;hed, the Kings of France a&s;&s;umed more openly the &s;tile and authority of law-givers, and before the begin|ning of the fifteenth century, the complete legi&s;lative power was ve&s;ted in them <NOTE N="[PP]" PLACE="foot">NOTE XXXVIII.</NOTE>.</P>

Charles VII. and Louis XI. fir&s;t ventured to exerci&s;e this new power, in the manner which I have already de|&s;cribed, the gradual increa&s;e of the royal authority had &s;o imperceptibly prepared the minds of the people of France for this innovation, that it excited no commo|tion in the kingdom, and &s;eems &s;carce to have given ri&s;e to any murmur or complaint.</P>
<P>WHEN the Kings of France had thus engro&s;&s;ed every power which can be exerted in government;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Govern|ment of France be|comes pure|ly monar|chical.</NOTE> when the right of making laws, of levying money, of keeping an army of mercenaries in con&s;tant pay, of declaring war and of con|cluding peace centered in the crown, the con|&s;titution of the kingdom, which, under the fir&s;t race of Kings, was nearly democratical, which, under the &s;econd race, became an ari&s;tocracy, terminated, under the third race, in a pure monarchy. Every thing that tended to pre&s;erve the appearance, or revive the memory of the ancient mixed government, &s;eems from that period to have been indu&s;triou&s;ly avoided. During the long and active reign of Francis I. the variety as well as extent of who&s;e operations obliged him to lay many heavy im|po&s;itions on his &s;ubjects, the States General of France were not once a&s;&s;embled, nor were the people once al|lowed to exert the power of taxing them&s;elves, which, according to the original ideas of feudal government, was a right e&s;&s;ential to every free-man.</P>
<P>TWO things, however, remained, which moderated the exerci&s;e of the regal prerogative,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The exer|ci&s;e of pre|rogative re|&s;trained by the privi|leges of the nobility.</NOTE> and re&s;train|ed it within &s;uch bounds as pre&s;erved the con|&s;titution of France from degenerating into mere de&s;poti&s;m. The rights and privileges claimed by the nobility mu&s;t be con&s;idered as one barrier again&s;t the ab&s;olute dominion of the crown. Though the nobles of France had lo&s;t that political power which was ve&s;ted in their order as a body, they &s;till retained the per&s;onal rights and pre-eminence which they derived from their rank. They pre&s;erved a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of elevation above other cla&s;&s;es of citizens; an exemption from burdens to which they were &s;ubject; a contempt of the occupations in which they were engaged; the privilege of a&s;&s;uming en&s;igns
<PB N="136" REF="011837_0163_0F9D8772B07C9518">
that indicated their dignity; a title to be treated with a certain degree of deference during peace; and a claim to various di&s;tinctions when in the field. Many of the&s;e preten&s;ions were not founded on the words of &s;tatutes, or derived from po&s;itive laws; they were defined and a&s;certained by the maxims of honour, a title more de|licate, but no le&s;s &s;acred. The&s;e rights, e&s;tabli&s;hed and protected by a principle equally vigilant in guarding, and intrepid in defending them, are to the Sovereign him&s;elf objects of re&s;pect and veneration Wherever they &s;tand in its way, the royal prerogative is bounded. The violence of a De&s;pot may exterminate &s;uch an order of men; but as long as it &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, and its ideas of per|&s;onal di&s;tinction remain entire, the power of the Prince has limits <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Des E&s;prits des Loix, liv. ii. c. 4.

<P>AS in France, the body of nobility was very nume|rous and retained an high &s;en&s;e of their own pre-emi|nence, to this we may a&s;cribe, in a great mea&s;ure, the mode of exerci&s;ing the royal prerogative which peculi|arly di&s;tingui&s;hes the government of that kingdom. An intermediate order was placed between the Monarch and his other &s;ubjects, and in every act of authority it became nece&s;&s;ary to attend to its privileges, and not on|ly to guard again&s;t any real violation of the&s;e, but to avoid any &s;u&s;picion of its being po&s;&s;ible that they might be violated. Thus a &s;pecies of government was e&s;tab|li&s;hed in France, unknown in the ancient world, that of a monarchy, in which the power of the &s;overeign, though unconfined by any legal or con&s;titutional re|&s;traint, has certain bounds &s;et to it by the ideas which one cla&s;s of his &s;ubjects entertain concerning their own dignity.</P>
<P>THE juri&s;diction of the Parliaments of France, parti|cularly that of Paris,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And by the juri&s;diction of the par|liaments, particularly that of Pa|ris.</NOTE> was the other barrier which &s;erved to confine the exerci&s;e of the royal prerogative within certain limits. The parliament of Paris was originally the court of the Kings of France, to which they com|mitted the &s;upreme admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice
<PB N="137" REF="011837_0164_0F9D877372A48210">
within their own domains, as well as the power of de|ciding with re&s;pect to all ca&s;es brought before it by ap|peals from the courts of the barons. When the time and place of its meeting were fixed, when not only the form of its procedure, but the principles on which it decided, were rendered regular and con&s;i&s;tent, when every cau&s;e of importance was finally determined there, and when the people became accu&s;tomed to re&s;ort thi|ther as to the &s;upreme temple of ju&s;tice, the parliament of Paris ro&s;e to high e&s;timation in the kingdom, its members acquired dignity, and its decrees were &s;ub|mitted to, with deference. The Kings of France, when they fir&s;t began to a&s;&s;ume the legi&s;lative power, in or|der to reconcile the minds of their people to this new exertion of prerogative, produced their edicts and or|donances in the parliament of Paris, that they might be approved of and regi&s;tered there, before they were pub|li&s;hed and declared to be of authority in the kingdom. During the intervals between the meetings of the States General of the kingdom, or under tho&s;e reigns when the States General were not a&s;&s;embled, the Monarchs of France were accu&s;tomed to con&s;ult the parliament of Paris with re&s;pect to the mo&s;t arduous affairs of govern|ment, and frequently regulated their conduct by its ad|vice, in declaring war, in concluding peace, and in other tran&s;actions of publick concern. Thus there was erected in the kingdom a tribunal which became the great depo&s;itory of the laws, and by the uniform tenor of its decrees it e&s;tabli&s;hed principles of ju&s;tice and forms of proceeding which were con&s;idered as &s;o &s;acred, that even the &s;overeign power of the Monarch dur&s;t not venture to di&s;regard or to violate them. The members of this illu&s;trious body, though they neither po&s;&s;e&s;s le|gi&s;lative authority, nor can be con&s;idered as the repre|&s;entatives of the people, have availed them&s;elves of the reputation and influence which they had acquired a|mong their countrymen, in order to make a &s;tand to the utmo&s;t of their ability again&s;t every unprecedented and exorbitant exertion of the prerogative. In every period of the French hi&s;tory, they have merited the prai&s;e of

It was a complex body, formed by the a&s;&s;ociation of &s;everal States, each of which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;overeign and independant juri&s;diction within its own territories. Of all the members which compo&s;ed this united body, the Emperor was the head. In his name, all decrees and regulations with re&s;pect to points of common concern, were i&s;&s;ued; and to him the power of carrying them into execution was commit|ted. But this appearance of monarchical power in the Emperor was more than counterbalanced by the influ|ence and authority of the Princes and States of the Em|pire in every act of admini&s;tration. No law extending to the whole body could pa&s;s, no re&s;olution that affected the general intere&s;t could be taken, without the appro|bation of the Diet of the Empire.

But if viewed in another light, &s;triking peculiarities in its political &s;tate pre&s;ent them&s;elves. The Germanick body was not formed by the union of members altogether di&s;tinct and independant. All the Princes and States joined in this a&s;&s;ociation, were originally &s;ubject to the Emperors, and acknowledged them as &s;overeigns. Be&s;ides this, they originally held their lands as Imperial fiefs, and in con|&s;equence of this tenure owed the Emperors all tho&s;e &s;er|vices which feudal va&s;&s;als are bound to perform to their liege lord. But though this political &s;ubjection was en|tirely at an end, and the influence of the feudal relation much dimini&s;hed, the ancient forms and in&s;titutions in|troduced when the Emperors governed Germany with authority, not inferior to that which the other monarchs of Europe po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, &s;till remained. Thus an oppo&s;i|tion was e&s;tabli&s;hed between the genius of the govern|ment, and the forms of admini&s;tration in the German Empire. The former con&s;idered the Emperor only as the head of a confederacy, the members of which, by their voluntary choice, have rai&s;ed him to that dignity; the latter &s;eemed to imply, that he is really inve&s;ted with &s;overeign power. By this circum&s;tance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The defects in the con+&s;titution of the Empire.</NOTE> &s;uch principles of ho&s;tility and di&s;cord were interwoven in the frame of the Germanick body, as affected each of its members, rendering their interior union incomplete, and their external efforts feeble and irregular.

to that of all other monarchs. The great|e&s;t Princes of the Empire attended and &s;erved them on &s;ome occa&s;ions, as the officers of their hou&s;hold. They exerci&s;ed prerogatives which no other &s;overeign ever claimed. They retained preten&s;ions to all the ex|ten&s;ive powers which their predece&s;&s;ors had enjoyed in any former age. But at the &s;ame time, in&s;tead of po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing that ample domain which had belonged to the an|cient Emperors of Germany, and which &s;tretched from Ba&s;il to Cologne, along both banks of the Rhine <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Pfeffel.

As their domain was alienated, their &s;tated revenues were reduced almo&s;t to nothing; and the extraordinary aids which on a few occa&s;ions they obtained, were granted &s;paringly, and paid with reluc|tance. The Princes and States of the Empire, though they &s;eemed to recognize the Imperial authority, were &s;ubjects only in name each of them po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a com|pleat municipal juri&s;diction within the precincts of his own territories.</P>

The Princes and States, aware of the nature as well as extent of their preten&s;ions, were perpetually on their guard, in order to watch all the motions of the Imperi|al court, and to circum&s;cribe its power within limits &s;till more narrow.

During a long period, all the members of the Germanick body a&s;&s;embled, and made choice of the per&s;on whom they appointed to be their head. But amid&s;t the violence and anarchy which prevailed for &s;everal centuries in the Empire, &s;even Princes who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t exten&s;ive territories, and who had obtained a hereditary title to the great offices of the State, acquired the exclu&s;ive privi|lege of nominating the Emperor. This right was con|firmed to them by the Golden Bull; the mode of exer|ci&s;ing it was a&s;certained, and they were dignified with the appellation of <HI>Electors.</HI> The nobility and free ci|ties being thus &s;tripped of a privilege which they had once enjoyed, were le&s;s connected with a Prince, to|wards who&s;e elevation they had not contributed by their &s;uffrages, and came to be more apprehen&s;ive of his au|thority.

The Princes and nobles to whom &s;upreme juri&s;diction be|longed, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;ort of monarchical power within their own territories, and the forms of their interior ad|mini&s;tration nearly re&s;embled tho&s;e of the great feudal kingdoms. The intere&s;ts, the ideas, the objects of States &s;o differently con&s;tituted, cannot be the &s;ame.

<P>THE &s;ecular and eccle&s;ia&s;tical members of the Em|pire were as little fitted for union as the free cities and the nobility.<NOTE PLACE="marg">From the oppo&s;ition between the &s;ecular and eccle&s;ia&s;tical members.</NOTE> Va&s;t territories were annexed to &s;everal of the German bi&s;hopricks and abbeys, and the dignified eccle&s;ia&s;ticks held &s;ome of the highe&s;t offices in the Em|pire by hereditary right. The younger &s;ons of noblemen of the &s;econd order, who had devoted them&s;elves to the church, were commonly promoted to the&s;e &s;tations of eminence and power; and it was no &s;mall mortification to the Princes and great nobility to &s;ee per|&s;ons rai&s;ed from an inferior rank to the &s;ame level with them&s;elves, or even exalted to &s;uperior dignity.

One tribe of the&s;e people, called Turks or Turcomans, extended its conque&s;ts, under various leaders, and during &s;everal centuries, from the &s;hore of the Ca&s;pian to the &s;traits of the Dardanelles. To|wards the middle of the fifteenth century, the&s;e formi|dable conquerors took Con&s;tantinople by &s;torm, and e&s;tabli&s;hed the &s;eat of their government in that Imperial city. Greece, Moldavia, Walachia, and the other pro|vinces of the ancient kingdoms of Thrace and Macedo|nia, together with part of Hungary, were &s;ubjected to their power.</P>
<P>BUT though the &s;eat of the Turki&s;h government was fixed in Europe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its de&s;potic genius.</NOTE> and the Sultans obtained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch exten&s;ive dominions in that quarter of the globe, the genius of their po|licy was purely A&s;iatick; and may be properly termed a de&s;poti&s;m, in contradi&s;tinction to the&s;e monarchical and republican forms of government which we have been hitherto contemplating. The &s;upreme power was ve&s;ted in Sultans of the Ottoman race, that blood being deem|ed &s;o &s;acred, that no other was thought worthy of the throne. From this elevation, the&s;e &s;overeigns could look down, and behold all their &s;ubjects reduced to the &s;ame level before them. The maxims of Turki&s;h po|licy admit not any of tho&s;e in&s;titutions, which, in other countries, limit the exerci&s;e, or moderate the rigour of monarchical power. No great court with con&s;titutional and permanent juri&s;diction to interpo&s;e both in the en|actment and execution of laws. No body of hereditary nobles, who&s;e &s;en&s;e of their own pre-eminence, who&s;e con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of what is due to their rank and character,

who&s;e jealou&s;y of their privileges circum&s;cribe the au|thority of the Prince, and &s;erve not only as a barrier again&s;t the exce&s;&s;es of his caprice, but &s;tand as an in|termediate order between him and the people. Under the Turki&s;h government, the political condition of eve|ry &s;ubject is equal. To be employed in the &s;ervice of the Sultan, is the only circum&s;tance that confers di&s;|tinction. Even this di&s;tinction is annexed &s;o clo&s;ely to the &s;tations in which per&s;ons &s;erve, that it is &s;carce com|municated to tho&s;e who are placed in them. The highe&s;t dignity in the Empire does not give any rank or pre-eminence to the family of him who enjoys it. As every man, before he is rai&s;ed to any &s;tation of authori|ty, mu&s;t go through the preparatory di&s;cipline of a long and &s;ervile obedience <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">State of the Turki&s;h Empire by Rycaut, p 25.</NOTE>, the moment he is deprived of power, he and his po&s;terity return to the &s;ame condition with other &s;ubjects, and &s;ink back into ob&s;curity. It is the di&s;tingui&s;hing and odious characteri&s;tick of the Ea&s;tern de&s;poti&s;m, that annihilates all other ranks of men, in order to exalt the monarch; that it leaves no|thing to the former, while it gives every thing to the latter; that it endeavours to fix in the minds of tho&s;e who are &s;ubject to it, the idea of no relation between men, but that of a ma&s;ter and of a &s;lave, the former de&s;tined to command and to puni&s;h, the latter formed to tremble and to obey <NOTE N="[TT]" PLACE="foot">NOTE XLII.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT as there are circum&s;tances which frequently ob|&s;truct or defeat the &s;alutary effects of the be&s;t regulated governments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Power of the Sultan limited by religion;</NOTE> there are others which contribute to mitigate the evils of the mo&s;t vicious forms of policy. There can in|deed, be no con&s;titutional re&s;traints on the will of a Prince in a de&s;potic government; but there may be &s;uch as are accidental. Ab&s;olute as the Turki&s;h Sul|tans are, they feel them&s;elves circum&s;cribed both by re|ligion, the principle on which their authority is found|ed <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Rycaut, p. 8.</NOTE>, and by the army, the in&s;trument which they mu&s;t employ in order to maintain it.

When the Koran hath pre&s;cribed any religious rite; hath enjoined any moral duty; or hath confirmed by its &s;anction, any political maxim, the command of the Sultan cannot overturn that which an higher autho|rity hath e&s;tabli&s;hed.

As the Turks extended their empire over nations, which they did not exterminate, but reduce to &s;ubjection, they found it nece&s;&s;ary to render their military e&s;tabli&s;hment numerous and formidable. Amurath, their third Sultan,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Origin of the Janiza|ries. A.

The&s;e, after being in&s;tructed in the Mahometan religion, in|ured to obedience by &s;evere di&s;cipline, and trained to warlike exerci&s;es, were formed into a body di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>Janizaries,</HI> or new &s;oldiers. Every &s;en|timent wich enthu&s;ia&s;m can in&s;pire, every mark of di&s;|tinction that the favour of the Prince could confer, were employed in order to animate this body with martial ar|dour, and with a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of its own pre-eminence <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Prince Cantemir's Hi&s;tory of the Othman Empire, p. 87.</NOTE>. The Janizaries &s;oon became the chief &s;trength and pride of the Ottoman armies; and by their number as well as reputation, were di&s;tingui&s;hed above all the troops, who&s;e duty it was to attend on the per&s;on of the Sul|tans <NOTE N="[UU]" PLACE="foot">NOTE XLIII.</NOTE>.</P>

The Janizaries in Con&s;tantinople, like the Praetorian bands in ancient Rome, quickly perceived all the advantages which they

derived from being &s;tationed in the capital; from their union under one &s;tandard; and from being ma&s;ters of the per&s;on of the Prince. The Sultans became no le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of their influence and importance. The <HI>Capi|culy,</HI> or &s;oldiery of the Porte, was the only power in the Empire that a Sultan or his Vi&s;ier had rea&s;on to dread. To pre&s;erve the fidelity and attachment of the Janizaries, was the great art of government, and the principal object of attention in the policy of the Ottoman court. Under a monarch, who&s;e abilities and vigour of mind fit him for command, they are ob&s;equious in&s;truments; execute whatever he enjoins; and render his power irre&s;i&s;tible. Under feeble Prin|ces, or &s;uch as are unfortunate, they become turbu|lent and mutinous; a&s;&s;ume the tone of Ma&s;ters; de|grade and exalt Sultans at plea&s;ure; and teach tho&s;e to tremble, on who&s;e nod, at other times, life or death depend.</P>
<P>FROM Mahomet II. who took Con&s;tanti|nople, to Solyman,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Progre&s;s of the Turks towards do|minion.</NOTE> who began his reign a few months after Charles V. was placed on the Imperial throne, a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of illu&s;trious Prin|ces ruled over the Turki&s;h Empire. By their great abilities, they kept their &s;ubjects of every order, mi|litary as well as civil, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to government; and had the ab&s;olute command of whatever force their va&s;t Empire was able to exert. Solyman, in particu|lar, who is known to the Chri&s;tians chiefly as a con|queror, but is celebrated in the Turki&s;h annals as the great law giver who e&s;tabli&s;hed order and police in their Empire, governed during his long reign with no le&s;s authority than wi&s;dom. He divided his domi|nions into &s;everal di&s;tricts; he appointed the number of &s;oldiers which each &s;hould furni&s;h; he appropriat|ed a certain proportion of the lands in every province for their maintenance; he regulated, with a minute accuracy, every thing relative to their di&s;cipline, their arms, and the nature of their &s;ervice. He put the fi|nances of the Empire into an orderly train of admini|&s;tration; and though the taxes in the Turki&s;h domi|nions, as well as in the other de&s;potic monarchies of the Ea&s;t, are far from being con&s;iderable, he &s;upplied that defect by an attentive and &s;evere oeconomy.</P>

The long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of able Princes, which I have mentioned, had given &s;uch vigour and firmne&s;s to the Ottoman government, that it &s;eems to have attained, during the &s;ixteenth century, the highe&s;t degree of perfection of which its con&s;titution was capable. Whereas the great monarchies in Chri&s;tendom were &s;till far from that &s;tate, which could enable them to act with a full exertion of their force. Be&s;ides this, the Turki&s;h troops in that age po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every advan|tage which ari&s;es from &s;uperiority in military di&s;ci|pline. At the time when Solyman began his reign, the Janizaries had been embodied near a century and a half, and during that long period the &s;everity of their military di&s;cipline had in no degree relaxed. The &s;oldiers drawn from the provinces of the Empire had been kept almo&s;t continually under arms, in the vari|ous wars which the Sultans had carried on with hardly any interval of peace. Again&s;t troops thus trained and accu&s;tomed to &s;ervice, the forces of the Chri&s;tian powers took the field with great di&s;advantage.

<P>THE barbarous nations were not only illiterate, but regarded literature with contempt. They found the inhabitants of all the provinces of the Empire &s;unk in effeminacy, and aver&s;e to war. Such a character was the object of &s;corn to an high-&s;pirited and gallant race of men. "When we would brand an enemy," &s;ays Liutprandus, "with di&s;graceful and contumelious ap|pellations, we call him a Roman; hoc &s;olo, id e&s;t <HI>Ro|mani</HI> nomine, quicquid ignobilitatis, quicquid timi|ditatis, quicquid avaritiae, quicquid luxuriae, quic|quid

This degeneracy of manners, illiterate barbarians imputed to their love of learning. Even after they &s;ettled in the countries which they had conquered, they would not permit their children to be in&s;tructed in any &s;cience; "for, (&s;aid they,) in&s;truction in the &s;ciences tends to corrupt, enervate, and depre&s;s the mind; and he who has been accu&s;tomed to tremble under the rod of a pedagogue, will never look on a &s;word or &s;pear with an undaunt|ed eye." Procop. de bello Gothor. lib. i. p. 4. ap Script. Byz. vol. i. A con&s;iderable number of years elap&s;ed, before nations &s;o rude, and &s;o unwilling to learn, could produce hi&s;torians capable of recording their tran&s;actions, or of de&s;cribing their manners and in&s;titutions. By that time, all memory of their anci|ent condition was lo&s;t, and no monument remained to guide their fir&s;t writers to any certain knowledge of it. If one expects to receive any &s;atisfactory account of the manners and laws of the Goths, Lombards, or Franks, during their re&s;idence in tho&s;e countries where they were originally &s;eated, from Jornandes, Paulus Warnefridus, or Gregory of Tours the earlie&s;t and mo&s;t authentick hi&s;torians of the&s;e people, he will be mi&s;erably di&s;appointed.

<P>A REMARKABLE confirmation of both parts of this rea&s;oning occurs in the hi&s;tory of England. The Sax|ons carried on the conque&s;t of that country with the &s;ame de&s;tructive &s;pirit, which di&s;tingui&s;hed the other barbarous nations. The ancient inhabitants of Bri|tain were either exterminated; or forced to take &s;hel|ter among the mountains of Wales; or reduced into &s;ervitude. The Saxon government, laws, manners and language were of con&s;equence introduced into Britain? and were &s;o perfectly e&s;tabli&s;hed, that all memory of the in&s;titutions previous to their conque&s;t was aboli&s;hed. The very rever&s;e of this happened in a &s;ub&s;equent revolution. A &s;ingle victory placed Wil|liam the Norman on the throne of England. The Sax|on inhabitants though oppre&s;&s;ed, were not exterminat|ed. William employed the utmo&s;t efforts of his pow|er and policy to make his new &s;ubjects conform in every thing to the Norman &s;tandard; but without &s;uc|ce&s;s. The Saxons, though vanqui&s;hed, were far more numerous than their conquerors; when they began to incorporate, their laws and manners gradually gained ground. The Norman in&s;titutions were unpopular and odious; many of them fell into di&s;u&s;e; and in the Engli&s;h con&s;titution and language, at this day, many e&s;&s;ential parts are manife&s;tly of Saxon, not of Norman extract.</P>

But as the change, which I have pointed out as a con&s;equence of the &s;et|tlement of the barbarous nations in the countries for|merly &s;ubject to the Roman Empire, could not have taken place, if the greater part of the ancient inhabi|tants had not been extirpated, an event of &s;uch impor|tance and influence merits a more particular illu&s;trati|on. This will ju&s;tify me for exhibiting &s;ome part of that melancholy &s;pectacle, over which humanity prompted Procopius to draw a veil. I &s;hall not, how|ever, di&s;gu&s;t my readers by a long detail; but re&s;t &s;a|tisfied with collecting &s;ome in&s;tances of the deva&s;tati|ons made by two of the many nations, which &s;ettled in the Empire. The Vandals were the fir&s;t of the bar|barians who invaded Spain. It was one of the riche&s;t and mo&s;t populous of the Roman Provinces; the in|habitants had been di&s;tingui&s;hed for courage, and had defended their liberty again&s;t the arms of Rome, with greater ob&s;tinacy, and during a longer cour&s;e of years, than any nation in Europe. But &s;o entirely were they enervated by their &s;ubjection to the Romans, that the Vandals who entered the kingdom A. D. 409. com|pleated the conque&s;t of it with &s;uch rapidity, that in the year 411, the&s;e barbarians divided it among them by ca&s;ting lots. The de&s;olation occa&s;ioned by their inva&s;ion is thus de&s;cribed by Idatius an eye witne&s;s. "The barbarians wa&s;ted every thing with ho&s;tile cru|elty. The pe&s;tilence was no le&s;s de&s;tructive. A dread|ful famine raged, to &s;uch a degree, that the living were con&s;trained to feed on the dead bodies of their fellow citizens; and all the&s;e terrible plagues de&s;olated at once the unhappy kingdoms." Idatii Chron. ap. Biblioth. Patrum. vol. vii. p. 1233. edit.

is given by I&s;idorus Hi&s;palen&s;is, and the con|temporary writers. I&s;id. Chron. ap. Grot. hi&s;t. Goth. 732. From Spain the Vandals pa&s;&s;ed over to Africa, A. D, 428. Africa was, next to Egypt, the mo&s;t fer|tile of the Roman provinces. It was one of the grana|ries of the Empire, and is called by an ancient writer, the &s;oul of the commonwealth. Though the army with which they invaded it, did not exceed 30,000 fight|ing men they became ab&s;olute ma&s;ters of the province in le&s;s than two years. A contemporary author gives a dreadful account of the havock which they made: "They found a province well cultivated, and enjoying plenty, the beauty of the whole earth. They carried their de&s;tructive arms into every corner of it; they di&s;peopled it by their deva&s;tations; exterminating e|very thing with fire and &s;word. They did not even &s;pare the vines, and fruit trees, that tho&s;e to whom caves and inacce&s;&s;ible mountains had afforded a retreat, might find no nouri&s;hment of any kind. Their ho&s;tile rage could not be &s;atiated, and there was no place ex|empted from the effects of it. They tortured their pri&s;oners with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite cruelty, that they might force from them a di&s;covery of their hidden trea&s;ures. The more they di&s;covered, the more they expected, and the more implacable they became. Nei|ther the infirmities of age nor of &s;ex; neither the dignity of nobility, nor the &s;anctity of the &s;acerdotal office, could mitigate their fury; but the more illu&s;tri|ous their pri&s;oners were, the more barbarou&s;ly they in&s;ulted them. The publick buildings which re&s;i&s;ted the violence of the flames, they levelled with the ground. They left many cities without an inhabitant. When they approached any fortified place, which their undi&s;ciplined army could not reduce, they gathered together a multitude of pri&s;oners, and putting them to the &s;word, left their bodies unburied, that the &s;tench of the carca&s;&s;es might oblige the garri&s;on to a|bandon it."

of the Vandals in Africa, Beli&s;arius attacked and di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them. Procopius, a contemporary hi&s;torian, de&s;cribes the deva&s;tation which that war occa&s;ioned. "Africa, &s;ays he, was &s;o entirely di&s;peopled, that one might travel &s;everal days in it without meeting one man; and it is no exaggeration to &s;ay, that in the cour&s;e of the war five millions of per&s;ons peri&s;hed." Proc. hi&s;t. Arcana cap. 18. ap. Byz. Script. vol. i. 315. I have dwelt longer upon the calamities of this pro|vince, becau&s;e they are de&s;cribed not only by contem|porary authors, but by eye-witne&s;&s;es. The pre&s;ent &s;tate of Africa confirms their te&s;timony. Many of the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing and populous cities with which it was filled, were &s;o entirely ruined, that no ve&s;tiges remain to point out where they were &s;ituated. That fertile territory which &s;u&s;tained the Roman Empire lies in a great mea&s;ure uncultivated; and that province, which Victor in his barbarous Latin called <HI>Specio&s;itas totius ter|rae florentis,</HI> is now the retreat of pirates and banditti.</P>
<P>WHILE the Vandals laid wa&s;te one part of the Em|pire, the Huns de&s;olated the re&s;t of it. Of all the bar|barous tribes they were the fierce&s;t and mo&s;t formida|ble.

"As in poli&s;hed &s;ocieties (&s;ays Ammianus) ea&s;e and tranquil|lity are courted, they delight in war and dangers. He who falls in battle is reckoned happy. They who die of old age or of di&s;ea&s;e are deemed infamous. They boa&s;t, with the utmo&s;t exultation, of the number of enemies whom they have &s;lain, and as the mo&s;t glori|ous of all ornaments, they fa&s;ten the &s;calps of tho&s;e who have fallen by their hand to the trappings of their hor&s;es."

barbarous rage, were a&s;toni&s;hed at the cruelty of their deva&s;tations. Thrace, Pannonia, and Illyricum were the countries which they fir&s;t laid de&s;olate. As they had no thoughts of &s;ettling in Europe, their inroads were frequent, and Procopius computes that in each of the&s;e, at a medium, two hundred thou&s;and per&s;ons peri&s;hed or were carried off as &s;laves. Procop. hi&s;t. Arcan. ap. Byz. &s;cript. vol. i. 316. Thrace the be&s;t cultivated province in that quarter of the Empire, was converted into a de&s;art, and when Pri&s;cus accompa|nied the amba&s;&s;adors &s;ent to Attila, there were no in|habitants in &s;ome of the cities, but a few mi&s;erable people who had taken &s;helter among the ruins of the churches; and the fields were covered with the bones of tho&s;e who had fallen by the &s;word. Pri&s;cus ap. Byz. Script. vol. i. 34. Attila became King of the Huns, A. D. 434. He is one of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t enterpriz|ing conquerors mentioned in hi&s;tory. He extended his Empire over all the va&s;t countries, comprehended un|der the general names of Scythia and Germany in the ancient divi&s;ion of the world. While he was carrying on his wars again&s;t the barbarous nations, he kept the Roman Empire under perpetual apprehen&s;ions, and extorted va&s;t &s;ub&s;idies from the timid and effeminate monarchs who governed it. In the year 451, he en|tered Gaul, at the head of an army compo&s;ed of all the various nations which he had &s;ubdued. It was more numerous than any with which the barbarians had hitherto invaded the Empire. The deva&s;tations which he commited were horrible; not only the open country, but the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing cities were de|&s;olated. The extent and cruelty of his deva&s;tations are de&s;cribed by Salvianus de Gubernat. Dei. edit. Baluz. Par. 1669. p. 139, &amp;c. and by Idatius ubi &s;u|pra p. 1235. Aetius put a &s;top to his progre&s;s in that country by the famous battle of Chalons, in which (if we may believe the hi&s;torians of that age) three hun|dred thou&s;and per&s;ons peri&s;hed.

Italy &s;uffered by the Huns exceeded all the calamities which the preceding incur&s;ions of the barbarians had brought upon it. Conringius has collected &s;everal pa&s;&s;ag|es from the ancient hi&s;torians, which prove that the deva&s;tations committed by the Vandals and Huns in the countries &s;ituated on the banks of the Rhine, were no le&s;s cruel and fatal to the human race. Exercitatio de urbibus Germaniae. Opera, vol. i. 489. But it is endle&s;s, it is &s;hocking to follow the&s;e de&s;troyers of mankind through &s;o many &s;cenes of horror, and to contemplate the havock which they made of the hu|man &s;pecies.</P>
<P>BUT the &s;tate in which Italy appears to have been, during &s;everal ages, after the barbarous nations &s;ettled in it, is the mo&s;t deci&s;ive proof of the cruelty as well as extent of their deva&s;tations. Whenever any coun|try is thinly inhabited, trees and &s;hrubs &s;pring up in the uncultivated fields, and &s;preading by degrees form large fore&s;ts; by the overflowing of rivers, and the &s;tagnating of waters, other parts of it are converted into lakes and mar&s;hes. Ancient Italy, the &s;eat of the Roman elegance and luxury, was cultivated to the highe&s;t pitch. But &s;o effectually did the deva&s;tations of the barbarians de&s;troy all the effects of their indu&s;try and cultivation, that in the eight century Italy appears to have been covered with fore&s;ts and mar&s;hes of va&s;t extent. Muratori enters into a long detail concerning the &s;ituation and limits of the&s;e; and proves by the mo&s;t authentick evidence, that great tracts of territo|ry, in all the different provinces of Italy, were either overrun with, wood, or laid under water. Nor did the&s;e occupy parts of the country naturally barren or of little value, but were &s;pread over di&s;tricts, which ancient writers repre&s;ent as extremely fertile, and which at pre&s;ent are highly cultivated. Muratori an|tiquitates Italicae medii aevi di&s;&s;ert. xxi. v. ii. p. 149, 153, &amp;c. A &s;trong proof of this occurs in a de&s;cripti|on of the city of Modena, by an author of the tenth century.

In many in&s;tances, lands are granted to per&s;ons becau&s;e they had taken them from the de&s;ert, <HI>ab eremo,</HI> and had cultivated and planted them with inhabitants. This appears from a charter of Charlemagne, publi&s;hed by Eckhart de rebus Fran|ciae Orientalis. vol. ii. p. 864, and from many charters of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors quoted by Du Cange voc, <HI>Eremus.</HI></P>
<P>MURATORI adds, that during the eighth and ninth centuries, Italy was greatly infe&s;ted by wolves and o|ther wild bea&s;ts; another mark of its being de&s;titute of inhabitants. Murat. Antiq. vol. ii. p. 163. Thus Italy, the pride of the ancient world for its fertility and cultivation, was reduced to the &s;tate of a country new|ly peopled, and rendered habitable.</P>
<P>I AM &s;en&s;ible, not only that &s;ome of the de&s;criptions of the deva&s;tations which I have quoted, may be ex|aggerated, but that the barbarous tribes proceeded in different manners, in making their new &s;ettlements. Some of them &s;eemed to be bent on exterminating the ancient inhabitants; others were more di&s;po&s;ed to in|corporate with them. It is not my province either to enquire into the cau&s;es which occa&s;ioned this variety in the conduct of the conquerors, or to de&s;cribe the &s;tate of tho&s;e countries where the ancient inhabitants were treated mo&s;t mildly. The facts which I have produc|ed are &s;ufficient to prove that the de&s;truction of the human &s;pecies, occa&s;ioned by their ho&s;tile inva&s;ions of the nothern nations, and their &s;ub&s;equent &s;ettlements, was much greater than the generality of writers &s;eem to imagine.</P>

perhaps, that ever wrote, of ob&s;erving them with profound di&s;cernment, and of de&s;cribing them with propriety and force. The reader mu&s;t perceive that I have Cae&s;ar and Tacitus in my eye. The former gives a &s;hort account of the ancient Germans in a few chap|ters of the &s;ixth book of his commentaries: The latter wrote a treati&s;e expre&s;sly on that &s;ubject.

<P N="1">1. THAT the &s;tate of Society among the ancient Ger|mans, was of the rude&s;t and mo&s;t &s;imple form. They &s;ub&s;i&s;ted entirely by hunting or by pa&s;turage. Cae&s;. lib. vi. c. 21. They neglected agriculture, and lived chiefly on milk, chee&s;e, and fle&s;h. Ibid. c. 22. Taci|tus agrees with him in mo&s;t of the&s;e points; de morib. Germ. c. 14, 15, 23. The Goths were equally negli|gent of agriculture. Pri&s;. Rhet. ap. Byz. Script. v. i. p. 31. B. Society was in the &s;ame &s;tate among the Huns, who di&s;dained to cultivate the earth, or to touch a plough, Amm. Marcel. lib. xxxi. p. 475. The &s;ame manners took place among the Alans; ibid. p. 477.

That the authority of civil goverment was extremely limited among the Germans. During times of peace they had no common or fixed magi&s;trate, but the chief men of every di&s;trict di&s;pen&s;ed ju&s;tice, and ac|commodated differences. Cae&s;. ibid. c. 23. Their kings had not ab&s;olute or unbounded power; their authori|ty con&s;i&s;ted rather in the privilege of advi&s;ing, than in the power of commanding. Matters of &s;mall con|&s;equence were determined by the chief men; affairs of importance by the whole community. Tacit. c. 7., 11. The Huns, in like manner, deliberated in common con|cerning every bu&s;ine&s;s of moment to the &s;ociety; and were not &s;ubject to the rigour of regal authority. Amm. Marcel. lib. xxxi. p. 474. 3. Every individual among the ancient Germans was left at liberty to chu&s;e whe|ther he would take part in any military enterprize which was propo&s;ed; there &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ems to have been no ob|ligation

to engage in it impo&s;ed on him by publick au|thority. "When any of the chief men propo&s;es any expedition, &s;uch as approve of the cau&s;e and of the leader ri&s;e up, and declare their intention of following him; and tho&s;e who do not fulfil this engagement, are con&s;idered as de&s;erters and traitors, and are look|ed upon as infamous." Cae&s;. ibid. c. 23. Tacitus plainly points at the &s;ame cu&s;tom, though in terms more ob|&s;cure. Tacit. c. 11. 4. As every individual was &s;o independant, and ma&s;ter in &s;o great a degree of his own actions, it became, of con&s;equence, the great ob|ject of every per&s;on among the Germans who aimed at being a leader, to gain adherents, and attach them to his per&s;on and intere&s;t. The&s;e adherents Cae&s;ar calls <HI>Ambacti</HI> and <HI>Clientes,</HI> i. e. retainers or clients; Tacitus, <HI>Comites,</HI> or companions. The chief di&s;tinction and power of the leaders, con&s;i&s;ted in being attended by a numerous band of cho&s;en youth. This was their pride as well as ornament during peace, and their defence in war. The favour of the&s;e retainers the leaders gain|ed or pre&s;erved by pre&s;ents of armour, and of hor&s;es; or by the profu&s;e, though inelegant ho&s;pitality, with which they entertained them. Tacit. c. 14, 15. 5. An|other con&s;equence of the per&s;onal liberty and indepen|dance which the Germans retained, even after they united in &s;ociety, was their circum&s;cribing the crimi|nal juri&s;diction of the magi&s;trate within very narrow limits, and their not only claiming but exerci&s;ing al|mo&s;t all the rights of private re&s;entment and revenge. Their magi&s;trates had not the power either of impri|&s;oning, or of inflicting any corporal puni&s;hment on a free man. Tacit. c. 7. Every per&s;on was obliged to avenge the wrongs which his parents or friends had &s;u&s;tained. Their enmities were hereditary, but not irreconcileable. Even murder was compen&s;ated by paying a certain number of cattle. Tac. c. 21. A part of the fine went to the King, or &s;tate, a part to the per&s;on who had been injured, or to his kindred. Ibid. c. 12.</P>
<P>THESE particulars concerning the in&s;titutions and manners of the Germans, though well known to every per&s;on conver&s;ant in ancient literature I have thought,

proper to arrange in this order, and to lay before &s;uch of my readers as may be le&s;s acquainted with the&s;e facts, both becau&s;e they confirm the account which I have given of the &s;tate of the barbarous nations, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd to illu&s;trate all the ob&s;ervations that I &s;hall have occa&s;i|on to make concerning the various changes in their government and cu&s;toms. The laws and cu&s;toms in|troduced by the barbarous nations into their new &s;et|tlements, are the be&s;t commentary on the writings of Cae&s;ar and Tacitus; and their ob&s;ervations are the be&s;t key to a perfect knowledge of the&s;e laws and cu&s;toms.</P>
<P>ONE circum&s;tance with re&s;pect to the te&s;timonies of Cae&s;ar and Tacitus concerning the Germans, merits at|tention. Cae&s;ar wrote his brief account of their man|ners more than an hundred years before Tacitus com|po&s;ed his treati&s;e de moribus Germanorum. An hun|dred years make a con&s;iderable period in the progre&s;s of national manners, e&s;pecially if, during that time, tho&s;e people who are rude and unpoli&s;hed have had much communication with more civilized &s;tates. This was the ca&s;e with the Germans. Their intercour&s;e with the Romans began when Cae&s;ar cro&s;&s;ed the Rhine, and increa&s;ed prodigiou&s;ly during the interval between that event and the time when Tacitus flouri&s;hed. Be&s;ides this, there was a con&s;iderable difference between the &s;tate of &s;ociety among the different tribes of Germans. The Suiones were &s;o much improved, that they began to be corrupted. Tac. cap. 44. The Fenni were &s;o barbarous, that it is wonderful how they were able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t. Ibid. cap. 46. Whoever undertakes to de&s;cribe the manners of the Germans, or to found any politi|cal theory upon the &s;tate of &s;ociety among them, ought carefully to attend to both the&s;e circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>BEFORE I quit this &s;ubject, it may not be impro|per to ob&s;erve, that though &s;ucce&s;&s;ive alterations in their in&s;titutions, together with the gradual progre&s;s of refinement, have made an entire change in the manners of the various people, who conquered the Roman Empire, there is &s;till one race of men nearly in the &s;ame political &s;ituation with that in which they were when they fir&s;t &s;ettled in their new conque&s;ts: I mean the various tribes and nations of Savages in

North-America. It cannot then be con&s;idered either as a digre&s;&s;ion, or as an improper indulgence of curio|&s;ity to enquire, whether this &s;imilarity in their politi|cal &s;tate has occa&s;ioned any re&s;emblance between their character and manners. If the likene&s;s turns out to be &s;triking, it is a &s;tronger proof, that a ju&s;t account has been given of the ancient inhabitants of Europe, than the te&s;timony even of Cae&s;ar or of Tacitus.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Americans &s;ub&s;i&s;t chiefly by hunting and fi&s;hing. Some tribes neglect agriculture entirely. Among tho&s;e who cultivate &s;ome &s;mall &s;pot near their huts, that, together with all works of labour, is performed by the women. P. Charlevoix Journal Hi&s;torique d'un Voyage de L'Amerique 49. Par. 1744. p. 334. In &s;uch a &s;tate of &s;ociety, the common wants of men being few, and their mutual dependence upon each other &s;mall, their union is ex|tremely imperfect and feeble, and they continue to enjoy their natural liberty almo&s;t unimpaired. It is the fir&s;t idea of an American, that every man is born free and independent, and that no power on earth hath any right to dimini&s;h or circum&s;cribe his natural liberty. There is &s;carce any appearance of &s;ubordina|tion either in civil or dome&s;tic government. Every one does what he plea&s;es. A father and mother with their children, live like per&s;ons whom chance has brought together, and whom no common bond unites, Their manner of educating their children is &s;uitable to this principle. They never cha&s;ti&s;e or puni&s;h them, even during their infancy. As they advance in years, they allow them to be entirely ma&s;ters of their own actions, and re&s;pon&s;able to no body. Id. p. 272, 273&mdash;2. The power of their civil magi&s;trates is extremely limited. Among mo&s;t of their tribes, the Sachem or chief is elective. A council of old men is cho&s;en to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, without who&s;e advice he determines no af|fair of importance. The Sachems neither po&s;&s;e&s;s nor claim any great degree of authority. They propo&s;e and intreat rather than command, The obedience of their people is altogether voluntary. Id. p. 266, 268&mdash;3. They engage in any military enterprizes, not from con&s;traint, but choice. When war is re&s;olved a chief
<PB N="176" REF="011837_0196_0F9D87CCBA4FF698">
ari&s;es, and offers him&s;elf to be the leader. They who are willing (for they compel no per&s;on) &s;tand up one after another, and &s;ing their war &s;ong. But if after this, any of the&s;e &s;hould refu&s;e to follow the leader, to whom they have engaged, his life would be in danger, and he would be con&s;idered as the mo&s;t infamous of all men. Id. p. 217, 218.&mdash;4. Such as engage to follow any leader, expect to be treated by him with great attention and re&s;pect; and he is obliged to make them pre&s;ents of con&s;iderable value. Id. p. 218.&mdash;5. Among the Americans, the magi&s;trate has &s;carce any criminal juri&s;diction. Id. p. 272. Upon receiving any injury, the per&s;on or family offended may inflict what puni&s;hment they plea&s;e on the per&s;on who was the author of it. Id. p. 274. Their re&s;entment and de&s;ire of vengeance are exce&s;&s;ive and implacable. Time can neither extingui&s;h or abate it. It is the chief in|heritance parents leave to their children; it is tran&s;|mitted from generation to generation, until an occa&s;i|on be found of &s;atisfying it. Id. p. 309. Sometimes, however, the offended party is appea&s;ed, A compen|&s;ation is paid for a murder that has been committed. The relations of the decea&s;ed receive it; and it con&s;i&s;ts mo&s;t commonly of a captive taken in war, who being &s;ub&s;tituted in the place of the per&s;on who was murder|ed, a&s;&s;umes his name and is adopted into his family. Id. p. 274. The re&s;emblance holds in many other par|ticulars. It is &s;ufficient for my purpo&s;e to have point|ed out the &s;imilarity of tho&s;e great features which di&s;|tingui&s;h and characterize both people. Bochart, and other philologi&s;ts of the la&s;t century, who, with more erudition than &s;cience, endeavoured to trace the mi|grations of various nations, and who were apt, upon the &s;lighte&s;t appearance of re&s;emblance, to find an affinity between nations far removed from each other, and to conclude that they were de&s;cended from the &s;ame an|ce&s;tors, would hardly have failed, on viewing &s;uch an amazing &s;imilarity, to pronounce with confidence "That the Germans and the Americans mu&s;t be the, &s;ame people" But a philo&s;oper will &s;atisfy him&s;elf with ob&s;erving, "That the characters of nations depends on the &s;tate of &s;ociety in which they live, and on the

I do not pretend that the &s;tate of &s;ociety in the two countries was perfectly &s;imilar. Many of the German tribes were more civi|lized than the Americans. Some of them were not unacquainted with agriculture; almo&s;t all of them had flocks of tame cattle, and depended for the chief part of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tance upon the&s;e. Mo&s;t of the Ame|rican tribes &s;ub&s;i&s;t by hunting, and are in a ruder and more &s;imple &s;tate than the ancient Germans.

<P>THE booty gained by an army belonged to an army. The King him&s;elf had no part of it but what he acquir|ed by lot. A remarkable in&s;tance of this occurs in the hi&s;tory of the Franks, the army of Clovis, the foun|der of the French monarchy, having plundered a church, carried off, among other &s;acred uten&s;ils, a va&s;e of extraordinary &s;ize and beauty. The bi&s;hop &s;ent deputies to Clovis, be&s;eeching him to re&s;tore the va&s;e, that it might be again employed in the &s;acred &s;ervices to which it had been con&s;ecrated.

<P>THE hi&s;tory of the e&s;tabli&s;hment and progre&s;s of the feudal &s;y&s;tem, is an intere&s;ting object to all the nations of Europe. In &s;ome countries their juri&s;prudence and laws are &s;till in a great mea&s;ure feudal. In others, many forms and practices e&s;tabli&s;hed by cu&s;tom, or founded on &s;tatutes, took their ri&s;e from the feudal law, and cannot be under&s;tood without attending to the ideas peculiar to it. Several authors of the high|e&s;t reputation for genius and erudition, have endea|voured to illu&s;trate this &s;ubject, but they have left ma|ny parts of it ob&s;cure. I &s;hall endeavour to trace, with preci&s;ion, the progre&s;s and variation of ideas concern|ing property in land among the barbarous nations; and &s;hall attempt to point out the cau&s;es which intro|duced the&s;e changes, as well as the effects which fol|lowed upon them. Property in land &s;eems to have gone through four &s;ucce&s;&s;ive changes among the peo|ple who &s;ettled in the various provinces of the Roman Empire.</P>

has been produced in note VI. While property continued in this &s;tate, we can di&s;cover nothing that bears any re|&s;emblance to a feudal tenure, or to the &s;ubordination and military &s;ervice which the feudal &s;y&s;tem introduced.</P>
<P N="2">II. UPON &s;ettling in the countries which they &s;ub|dued, the victorious army divided the conquered lands. That portion which fell to every &s;oldier, he &s;eized as a recompence due to his valour, as a &s;ettlement acquir|ed by his own &s;word. He took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it as a freeman in full property. He enjoyed it during his own life, and could di&s;po&s;e of it at plea&s;ure, or tran&s;|mit it as an inheritance to his children. Thus pro|perty in land became fixed. It was at the &s;ame time <HI>allodial,</HI> i. e. the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or had the entire right of pro|perty and dominion; he held of no &s;overeign or &s;upe|rior lord, to whom he was bound to do homage, and perform &s;ervice&punc; But as the&s;e new proprietors were in &s;ome danger (as has been ob&s;erved in the text) of be|ing di&s;turbed by the remainder of the ancient inhabi|tants, and in &s;till greater danger of being attacked by barbarians as fierce and rapacious as them&s;elves, they &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of coming under obligations to de|fend the community, more explicit than tho&s;e to which they had been &s;ubject in their original habitati|ons. On this account, immediately upon their fixing in their new &s;ettlements, every freeman became bound to take arms in defence of the community, and if he re|fu&s;ed or neglected &s;o to do, was liable to a con&s;idera|ble penalty. I do not mean that any contract of this kind was formally concluded, or mutually ratified by any legal &s;olemnity. It was, like the other compacts which hold &s;ociety together, e&s;tabli&s;hed by tacit con|&s;ent; and their mutual &s;ecurity and pre&s;ervation made it the intere&s;t of all to recognize its authority, and to enforce the ob&s;ervation of it. We can trace back this new obligation on the proprietors of land to a very early period in the hi&s;tory of the Franks. Chilperic, who began his reign A. D. 562, exacted a fine, <HI>bannos ju&s;&s;et exigi,</HI> from certain per&s;ons who had refu&s;ed to accompany him in an expedition. Gregor. Turon. lib. v. c. 26. p. 211.

<P N="3">III. PROPERTY in land having thus become fixed and &s;ubject to military &s;ervice, another change was introduced, though &s;lowly, and &s;tep by &s;tep.

Leg. Salicor. Tit. 44. &sect;. 1. &amp; 2. While the Germans remained in their own country they courted the favour of the&s;e Comites by pre&s;ents of arms and hor&s;es, and by ho&s;pitality. See note VI. While they had no fixed property in

land, the&s;e were the only gifts that they could be&s;tow, and the only reward which their followers de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed. But upon their &s;ettling in the countries which they conquered, and when the value of property came to be under&s;tood among them, in&s;tead of the&s;e &s;light pre&s;ents, the Kings and chieftains be&s;towed a more &s;ub&s;tantial recompence in land on their adherents. The&s;e grants were called <HI>beneficia,</HI> becau&s;e they were gratuitous donations; and <HI>honores,</HI> becau&s;e they were regarded as marks of di&s;tinction. What were the &s;ervices originally exacted in return for the&s;e <HI>beneficia</HI> cannot be determined with ab&s;olute preci&s;ion; becau&s;e there are no records &s;o ancient. When allodial po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|ons were fir&s;t rendered feudal, they were not, at once, &s;ubjected to the feudal &s;ervices. The tran&s;ition here, as in all other changes of importance, was gradual. As the great object of a feudal va&s;&s;al was to obtain protection, when allodial proprietors fir&s;t con&s;ented to become va&s;&s;als of any powerful leader, they conti|nued to retain as much of their ancient independance as was con&s;i&s;tent with that new relation. The homage which they did to the &s;uperior of whom they cho&s;e to hold, was called <HI>homagium planum,</HI> and bound them to nothing more than fidelity, but without any obli|gation either of military &s;ervice, or attendance in the courts of their &s;uperior. Of this <HI>homagium planum</HI> &s;ome traces, though ob&s;cure, may &s;till be di&s;covered. Bru&s;|&s;el, tom. i. p. 97. Among the ancient writs pub|li&s;hed by D. D.

But the&s;e engagements are accompanied with none of the feudal formalities, and no mention is made of any of the feudal &s;ervices. They appear ra|ther to be a mutual contract between equals, than the engagement of a va&s;&s;al to perform &s;ervices to a &s;uperi|or

But upon com|paring their proofs and rea&s;onings and conjectures, it &s;eems to be evident, that as every free man, in con&s;e|quence of his allodial property, was bound to &s;erve the community under a &s;evere penalty, no good rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned for conferring the&s;e beneficia, if they did not &s;ubject &s;uch as received them, to &s;ome new ob|ligation. Why &s;hould a King have &s;tripped him&s;elf of his domain, if he had not expected, that, by parcel|ling it out, he might acquire a right to &s;ervices to which he had formerly no title? We may then warrantably conclude, "That as allodial property &s;ubjected tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it to &s;erve the community, &s;o <HI>beneficia</HI> &s;ubjected &s;uch as held them, to per&s;onal &s;ervice and fi|delity to him from whom they received the&s;e lands. The&s;e beneficia were granted originally only during plea&s;ure. No circum&s;tance relating to the cu&s;toms of the middle ages is better a&s;certained than this; and innumerable proofs of it might be added to the&s;e pro|duced in L'e&s;prit des Loix, l. xxx. c. 16. and by Du Cange voc. <HI>beneficium &amp; feudum.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. BUT the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of benefices did not continue long in this &s;tate.

De re Diplomatica, lib. vi. p. 353. In the year 889, Odo King of France granted lands to Ricabodo fideli &s;uo jure beneficiario &amp; fructu|ario during his own life; and if he &s;hould die, and a &s;on were born to him, that right was to continue dur|ing the life of his &s;on. Mabillon ut &s;upra. p. 556. This was an intermediate &s;tep between fiefs merely during life, and fiefs hereditary to perpetuity. While benefi|cia continued under their fir&s;t form, and were held on|ly during plea&s;ure, he who granted them not only ex|erci&s;ed the <HI>Dominium</HI> or prerogative of &s;uperior Lord; but he retained the property, giving his va&s;&s;al only the <HI>u&s;ufruct.</HI> But under the latter form, when they became hereditary, although feudal lawyers continu|ed to define a beneficium agreeable to its original na|ture, the property was in effect taken out of the hands of the &s;uperior Lord, and lodged in tho&s;e of the va&s;&s;al. As &s;oon as the reciprocal advantages of the feudal mode of tenure came to be under&s;tood by &s;uperiors as well as va&s;&s;als, that &s;pecies of holding became &s;o a|greeable to both, that not only lands, but ca&s;ual rents, &s;uch as the profits of a toll, the fare paid at ferries, &amp;c. the &s;alaries or perqui&s;ites of offices, and even pen&s;ions them&s;elves, were granted and held as fiefs; and mili|tary &s;ervice was promi&s;ed and exacted on account of the&s;e.

clergy of the church or mona&s;tery which performed that duty, but the&s;e were &s;ometimes &s;eized by the powerful barons. In order to a&s;certain their right to them, they held them as fiefs of the church, and par|celled them out in the &s;ame manner as other property to their &s;ub-va&s;&s;als. Bouquet. recueil des hi&s;t. vol. x. p. 238, 480. The &s;ame &s;pirit of encroachment which rendered fiefs hereditary, led the nobles to ex|tort from their &s;overeigns hereditary grants of offices. Many of the great offices of the crown became heredi|tary in mo&s;t of the kingdoms in Europe, and &s;o con|&s;cious were monarchs of this &s;pirit of u&s;urpation among the nobility, and &s;o &s;olicitous to guard again&s;t it, that, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, they obliged the per&s;ons whom they promoted to any office of dignity, to grant an obligation that neither they, nor their heirs, &s;hould claim it as belonging to them by hereditary right. A remarkable in&s;tance of this is produced, Mem. de l'Acad. des In&s;cript. tom. xxx. p. 595. Another occurs in the The&s;aur. annecdot. publi&s;hed by Mar|tene &amp; Durand, vol. i. p. 873.&mdash;This revolution in property occa&s;ioned a change corre&s;ponding to it in political government; the great va&s;&s;als of the crown, as they acquired &s;uch exten&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, u&s;urped a a proportional degree of power, depre&s;&s;ed the juri&s;dic|tion of the crown, and trampled on the privileges of the people. It is on account of this connection, that the tracing the progre&s;s of feudal property becomes an object of attention in hi&s;tory; for upon di&s;covering in what &s;tate property was at any particular period, we may determine with preci&s;ion what was the degree of power po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the King or by the nobility at that juncture.</P>
<P>ONE circum&s;tance more, with re&s;pect to the changes which property underwent, de&s;erves attention. I have &s;hewn that when the various tribes of barbarians divided their conque&s;ts in the fifth and &s;ixth centuries, the property which they acquired was allodial; but in &s;everal parts of Europe property had become almo&s;t entirely feudal by the beginning of tenth century. The former &s;pecies of property &s;eems to be &s;o much better and more de&s;irable than the latter, that &s;uch a
<PB N="186" REF="011837_0206_0F9D8657380F9FA0">
change appears &s;urpri&s;ing, e&s;pecially when we are in|formed that allodial property was frequently convert|ed into feudal, by a voluntary deed of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. The motives which determined them to a choice &s;o re|pugnant to the ideas of modern times concerning pro|perty, have been inve&s;tigated and explained by M. de Monte&s;quieu with his u&s;ual di&s;cernment and accuracy, lib. xxx. c. 8. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable is that of which we have an hint in Lambertus Arden&s;is, an|cient writer quoted by Du Cange, voce <HI>Alodis.</HI> In tho&s;e times of anarchy and di&s;order which became ge|neral in Europe after the death of Charlemagne; when there was &s;carce any union among the different mem|bers of the community; and individuals were expo&s;ed, &s;ingle and undefended by government, to rapine and oppre&s;&s;ion, it became nece&s;&s;ary for every man to have a powerful protector; under who&s;e banner he might range him&s;elf, and obtain &s;ecurity again&s;t ene|mies, whom he could not &s;ingly oppo&s;e. For this rea|&s;on he relinqui&s;hed his allodial independance, and &s;ub|jected him&s;elf to the feudal &s;ervices, that he might find &s;afety under the patronage of &s;ome re&s;pectable &s;u|perior. In &s;ome parts of Europe, this change from allodial to feudal property became &s;o general, that he who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed land had no longer any liberty of choice left. He was obliged to recognize &s;ome liege Lord, and to hold of him. Thus Beaumanoir informs us, that in the counties of Clermont and Beauvois, if the Lord or Count di&s;covered any lands within his juri&s;|diction, for which no &s;ervice was performed, and which paid to him no tax or cu&s;tom, he might in&s;tantly &s;eize it as his own; for, &s;ays he, according to our cu&s;tom no man can hold allodial property. Cou&s;t. ch. 24. p. 123. Upon the &s;ame principle is founded a maxim, which has at length become general in the law of France, <HI>Nulle terre &s;ans Seigneur.</HI> In other pro|vinces of France allodial property &s;eems to have re|mained longer unalienated, and to have been more highly valued. A va&s;t number of charters containing grants, or &s;ales, or exchanges of allodial lands in the province of Languedoc are publi&s;hed Hi&s;t. gener. de Langued. par D. D.

During the ninth, tenth, and greater part of the ele|venth century, the property in that province &s;eems to have been entirely allodial; and &s;carce any mention of feudal tenures occurs in the deeds of that country.

But the authenticity of that deed has been called in que&s;tion, and perhaps the frequent u&s;e of the word <HI>feudum</HI> in it, is an additional rea&s;on for doing &s;o. The account which I have given of the nature both of allo|dial and feudal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions receives &s;ome confirmation from the etymology of the words them&s;elves. <HI>Alode</HI> or <HI>allodium</HI> is compounded of the German particle <HI>an</HI> and <HI>lot, i. e.</HI> land obtained by lot. Wachteri Glo&s;&s;ar. Germanicum, voc. <HI>Allodium.</HI> p. 35. It appears from the authorities produced by him and by Du Cange, voc. <HI>&s;ors,</HI> that the nothern nations divided the lands which they had conquered in this manner. Feodum is compounded of <HI>od</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or e&s;tate, and <HI>feo</HI> wages pay; intimating that it was &s;tipendary and granted as a recompence for &s;ervice, Wachterus ibid. voc. <HI>feo|dum,</HI> p. 441.</P>
<P>THE progre&s;s of the feudal &s;y&s;tem among the Ger|mans was perfectly &s;imiliar to that which we have tra|ced in France. But as the Emperors of Germany, e&s;|pecially after the Imperial crown pa&s;&s;ed from the de|&s;cendants of Charlemagne to the hou&s;e of Saxony, were far &s;uperior to the contemporary Monarchs of France, in abilities, the Imperial va&s;&s;als did not a&s;pire &s;o early to independance, nor did they &s;o &s;oon obtain the privilege of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing their benefices by heredita|ry right. Conrad II. on the Salic, was the fir&s;t Empe|ror, according to the compilers of the Libri Feudo|rum, who rendered fiefs hereditary. Lib. i. tit. i. Conrad began his reign A. D. 1024. Ludovicus Pi|us,

under who&s;e reign, grants of hereditary fiefs were frequent in France, &s;ucceeded his father, A. D. 814. Not only was this innovation &s;o much later in being introduced among the va&s;&s;als of the German Emperors but even after Conrad had e&s;tabli&s;hed it, the law con|tinued favourable to the ancient practice, and unle&s;s the charter of the va&s;&s;al bore expre&s;ly that the fief de|&s;cended to his heirs, it was pre&s;umed to be granted only during life. Lib. feud. ibid. Even after the al|teration made by Conrad, it was not uncommon in Germany to grant fiefs only for life; a charter of this kind occurs as late as the year 1376. Charta ap. Boeh|mer. Princip. Jur. feud. p. 361. The tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion of fiefs to collateral and female heirs, took place very &s;lowly among the Germans. There is extant a char|ter, A. D. 1201. conveying the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to females, but it is granted as an extraordinary mark of favour, and in reward of uncommon &s;ervices. Boeh|mer. ibid. p. 365. In Germany, as well as in France and Italy, a con&s;iderable part of the lands continued to be allodial long after the feudal mode of tenure was introduced. It appears from the Codex Diplomaticus Mona&s;terii Buch, that a great part of the lands in the marqui&s;ate of Mi&s;nia was &s;till allodial as late as the thirteenth century.

<P>AS I &s;hall, in another note, have occa&s;ion to repre|&s;ent the condition of that part of the people who dwelt in cities, I will confine my&s;elf in this to con&s;ider the &s;tate of the inhabitants of the country. The per&s;ons employed in cultivating the ground during the ages under review may be divided into three cla&s;&s;es: I. <HI>Servi</HI> or &s;laves. This &s;eems to have been the mo&s;t nu|merous cla&s;s, and con&s;i&s;ted either of captives taken in

war, or of per&s;ons, the property in whom was acquir|ed in &s;ome one of the various methods enumerated by Du Cange, voc. <HI>&s;ervus.</HI> v. 6. p. 447. The wretched condition of this numerous race of men will appear from &s;everal circum&s;tances. 1. Their ma&s;ters had ab|&s;olute dominion over their per&s;ons. They had the power of puni&s;hing their &s;laves capitally, without the intervention of any judge. This dangerous right they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not only in the more early periods, when their manners were fierce, but it continued as late as the twelfth century. Joach. Potgie&s;&s;erus de &s;tatu &s;er|vorum. Lemgov. 1736. 4to. lib. ii. cap. i. &sect;. 4, 10, 13, 24. Even after this juri&s;diction of ma&s;ters came to be re&s;trained, the life of a &s;lave was deemed to be of &s;o little value, that a very &s;light compen&s;ation attoned for taking it away. Idem, lib. iii. c. 6. If ma&s;ters had power over the lives of their &s;laves, it is evident that almo&s;t no bounds would be &s;et to the rigour of the puni&s;hments which they might inflict upon them. The Codes of ancient laws pre&s;cribed puni&s;hments for the crimes of &s;laves different from tho&s;e which were inflict|ed on free men. The latter paid only a fine or com|pen&s;ation, the former were &s;ubjected to corporal pu|ni&s;hments. The cruelty of the&s;e was in many in&s;tan|ces exce&s;&s;ive. Slaves, on very &s;light occa&s;ions, might be put to the rack on que&s;tion. The laws with re&s;|pect to the&s;e points are to be found in Potgie&s;&s;erus, lib. iii. cap. 7. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">2. If the dominion of ma&s;ters over the the lives and per&s;ons of their &s;laves was thus exten&s;ive, it was no le&s;s &s;o over their actions and property. They were not originally permitted to marry. Male and fe|male &s;laves were allowed and even encouraged to co|habit together. But this union was not con&s;idered as a marriage, it was called <HI>contubernium,</HI> not <HI>nuptiae</HI> or <HI>matrimonium.</HI> Potgie&s;&s;. lib. ii. c. 2. &sect;. 1. This notion was &s;o much e&s;tabli&s;hed, that during &s;everal centuries after the barbarous nations embraced the Chri&s;tian re|ligion, &s;laves who lived as hu&s;band and wife, were not joined together by any religious ceremony, and did not receive the nuptial benediction from a prie&s;t. Ibid. &sect;. 10, 11. When this conjunction between &s;laves came to be con&s;idered as a lawful marriage, they were
<PB N="191" REF="011837_0211_0F9D865AF06A8BE8">
not permitted to marry without con&s;ent of their ma|&s;ter, and &s;uch as ventured to do &s;o without obtaining that, were puni&s;hed with great &s;everity, and &s;ome|times were put to death. Potgie&s;&s;. ibid. &sect;. 12, &amp;c. Gregor. Turon. hi&s;tor. lib. v. c. 3. When the man|ners of the European nations became more gentle, and their ideas more liberal, &s;laves who married without their ma&s;ter's con&s;ent, were &s;ubjected only to a fine. Potgie&s;&s;. ibid. &sect;. 20. Du Cange Glo&s;&s;. voc. <HI>Fori&s;ma|ritagium.</HI> 3. All the children of &s;laves, were in the &s;ame condition with their parents, and became the pro|perty of the ma&s;ter. Du Cange Glo&s;&s;. voc. <HI>&s;ervus,</HI> vol. 6. p. 450. Murat. antiq. Ital. vol. i. p. 766. 4. Slaves were &s;o entirely the property of their ma&s;ters, that they could &s;ell them at plea&s;ure. While dome&s;tick &s;lavery continued, the property in a &s;lave was &s;old in the manner with that which a per&s;on had in any other moveable. Afterwards &s;laves became <HI>ad&s;cripti</HI> glebae, and were conveyed by &s;ale together with the farm or e&s;tate to which they belonged. Potgie&s;&s;erus has col|lected the laws and charters which illu&s;trate this well known circum&s;tance in the condition of &s;laves. Lib. ii. c. 4. 5. Slaves had a title to nothing but &s;ub&s;i&s;tance and cloaths from their ma&s;ter; all the profits of their labour accrued to him. If a ma&s;ter, from indulgence, gave his &s;laves any <HI>peculium</HI> or fixed allowance for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, they had no right of property in what they &s;aved out of that. All that they accumulated belonged to their ma&s;ter. Potgie&s;&s;. lib. ii. c. 10. Mu|rat. antiq. Ital. vol. 768. Du Cange, voc. <HI>&s;ervus,</HI> vol. vi. p. 451. Conformable to the &s;ame principle, all the ef|fects of &s;laves belonged to their ma&s;ter at their death, and they could not di&s;po&s;e of them by te&s;tament. Pot|gie&s;&s; lib. ii. c. 11. 6. Slaves were di&s;tingui&s;hed from free men by a peculiar dre&s;s. Among all the barba|rous nations, long hair was a mark of dignity and of freedom, &s;laves were for that rea&s;on obliged to &s;have their heads; and by this di&s;tinction, how indifferent &s;o|ever it may be in its own nature, they were reminded every moment of the inferiority of their condition. Potgie&s;&s;. lib. iii. c. 4. For the &s;ame rea&s;on it was en|acted in the laws of almo&s;t all the nations of Europe
<PB N="192" REF="011837_0212_0F9D865BC4DA0508">
that no &s;lave &s;hould be admitted to give evidence again&s;t a free man in a court of ju&s;tice. Du Cange, voc. <HI>&s;er|vus,</HI> vol. vi. p. 451. Potgie&s;&s;. lib. iii. c. 3.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Villani.</HI> They were likewi&s;e <HI>ad&s;cripti glebae</HI> or <HI>vil|lae,</HI> from which they derived their name, and were transferable along with it. Du Cange, voc. <HI>villan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s.</HI> But in this they differed from &s;laves, that they paid a fixed rent to their ma&s;ter for the land which they cul|tivated, and after paying that, all the fruits of their labour and indu&s;try belonged to them&s;elves in proper|ty. This di&s;tinction is marked by Piere de Fontaine's Con&s;eil. Vie de St. Louis par Joinville, p. 119. edit. de Du Cange. Several ca&s;es decided agreeable to this principle are mentioned by Murat. Ibid. p. 773.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE la&s;t cla&s;s of per&s;ons employed in agriculture were free men. The&s;e are di&s;tingui&s;hed by various names among the writers of the middle ages, <HI>Ariman|ni, conditionales, originarii, tributales, &amp;c.</HI> The&s;e &s;eem to have been per&s;ons who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;mall allodial property of their own, and be&s;ides that, cultivated &s;ome farm belonging to their more wealthy neighbours, for which they paid a fixed rent; and bound them|&s;elves likewi&s;e to perform &s;everal &s;mall &s;ervices <HI>in prato vel in me&s;&s;e, in aratura vel in vinea,</HI> &s;uch as ploughing a cer|tain quantity of their landlord's ground, a&s;&s;i&s;ting him in harve&s;t and vintage work, &amp;c. The cleare&s;t proof of this may be found in Muratori, v. i. p. 712&punc; and in Du Cange under the re&s;pective words abovemention|ed. I have not been able to di&s;cover whether the&s;e <HI>arimanni,</HI> &amp;c. were removeable at plea&s;ure, or held their farms by lea&s;e for a certain number of years. The former, if we may judge from the genius and maxims of the age, &s;eems to be mo&s;t probable. The&s;e per&s;ons, however, were con&s;idered as free men in the mo&s;t honourable &s;en&s;e of the word; they enjoyed all the privileges of that condition, and were even called to &s;erve in war; an honour to which no &s;lave was ad|mitted. Murat. Antiq. vol. i. p. 743. vol. ii. p. 446. This account of the condition of the&s;e three different cla&s;&s;es of per&s;ons, will enable the reader to apprehend the full force of an argument which I &s;hall produce in confirmation of what I have &s;aid in the text concern|ing
<PB N="193" REF="011837_0213_0F9D865C760E0EF8">
the wretched &s;tate of the people. Notwith&s;tand|ing the immen&s;e difference between the fir&s;t of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es and the third, &s;uch was the &s;pirit of tyranny which prevailed among the great proprietors of land, and &s;o various their opportunities of oppre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e who were &s;ettled on their e&s;tates, and of rendering their condition intolerable, that many freemen, in de&s;|pair, renounced their liberty, and voluntarily &s;urren|dered them&s;elves as &s;laves to their powerful ma&s;ters. This they did, in order that their ma&s;ters might become more immediately intere&s;ted to afford them protection, to|gether with the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting them&s;elves and their families. The forms of &s;uch a &s;urrender, or <HI>ob|noxiatio,</HI> as it was then called, are pre&s;erved by Mar|culfus, lib. ii. c. 28; and by the anonymous collector of <HI>formulae</HI> publi&s;hed by Bignon, c. 16. together with Marculfus. In both, the rea&s;on for the <HI>obnoxiatio,</HI> is the wretched and indigent condition of the per&s;on who gives up his liberty. It was &s;till more common for freemen to &s;urrender their liberty to bi&s;hops or abbots, that they might partake of the &s;ecurity which the va&s;|&s;als and &s;laves of churches and mona&s;teries enjoyed, in con&s;equence of the &s;uper&s;titious veneration paid to the &s;aint under who&s;e immediate protection they were &s;uppo&s;ed to be taken. Du Cange, voc. <HI>oblatus,</HI> vol. iv. p. 1286. That condition mu&s;t have been mi&s;e|rable indeed, which could induce a freeman volunta|rily to renounce his liberty, and to give him&s;elf up as a &s;lave to the di&s;po&s;al of another. The number of &s;laves in all the nations of Europe was prodigious. The greater part of the inferior cla&s;s of people in France were reduced to this &s;tate, at the commencement of the third race of Kings. L'e&s;pr. des Loix, liv. xxx. c. 11.

Many charters granted by per&s;ons of the highe&s;t rank are pre&s;erved, from which it appears that they could not &s;ub&s;cribe their names. It was u&s;ual for per&s;ons who could not write, to make the &s;ign of the cro&s;s in confirmation of a charter. Several of the&s;e remain, where Kings and per&s;ons of great eminence affix <HI>&s;ig|num crucis manu propria pro ignoratione literarum.</HI> Du Cange, voc. Crux, vol. iii. p. 1191. From this is derived the phra&s;e of &s;igning in&s;tead of &s;ub&s;cribing a paper. In the ninth century, Herbaud Comes Palatii, though &s;upreme judge of the Empire by virtue of his office, could not &s;ub&s;cribe his name. Nouveau Trait&eacute; de Diplomatique par deux Benedictins, 4to. tom. ii. p. 422. So late as the fourteenth century, Du Gue&s;|clin, con&s;table of France, the greate&s;t man in the &s;tate, and one of the greate&s;t men of his age, could neither read nor write. St. Palaye Memoires &s;ur l'ancienne Chevalerie, t. ii. p. 82. Nor was this ignorance confined to laymen; the greater part of the clergy was not many degrees &s;uperior to them in &s;cience. Many dignified eccle&s;ia&s;ticks could not &s;ub&s;cribe the canons of tho&s;e councils in which they &s;at as members. Nouv. Trait&eacute; de diplom. tom. ii. p. 424. One of the que&s;tions appointed by the canons to be put to per&s;ons who were candidates for orders was this, "Whether they could read the go&s;pels and epi&s;tles, and explain the &s;en&s;e of them, at lea&s;t literally?" Regino Prumien&s;is ap. Bruck. Hi&s;t. Philo&s;. v. iii. p. 631. Alfred the Great complained, that from the Humber to the Thames there was not a prie&s;t who under&s;tood the liturgy in his mother tongue, or who could tran&s;late the ea&s;ie&s;t piece of Latin; and that from the Thames to the &s;ea, the eccle&s;ia&s;ticks were &s;till more ignorant. A&s;&s;erus de rebus ge&s;tis Alfredi, ap. Camdeni. Anglica, &amp;c. p. 25. The ignorance of the clergy is quaintly de&s;cribed by an author of the dark ages.

&s;tate of government and manners, from the &s;eventh to the eleventh century, we may add the &s;carcity of books, and the difficulty of rendering them more common during that period. The Romans wrote their books either on parchment or on paper made of the Egyptian papyrus. The latter being the cheape&s;t, was of cour&s;e the mo&s;t commonly u&s;ed. But after the Saracens conquered Egypt in the &s;eventh century, the communication between that country and the people &s;ettled in Italy or in other parts of Europe, was almo&s;t entirely broke off, and the papyrus was no longer in u&s;e among them. They were obliged, on that ac|count, to write all their books upon parchment, and as the price of that was high, books became extreme|ly rare and of great value. We may judge of the &s;carcity of the materials for writing them from one circum|&s;tance. There &s;till remains &s;everal manu&s;cripts of the eighth, ninth, and following centuries, wrote on parchment, from which &s;ome former writing had been era&s;ed, in order to &s;ub&s;titute a new compo&s;ition in its place. In this manner, it is probable, that &s;e|veral works of the ancients peri&s;hed. A book of Li|vy or of Tacitus might be era&s;ed, to make room for the legendary tale of a &s;aint, or the &s;uper&s;titious prayers of a mi&s;&s;al. Murat. Anti. Ital. v. iii. p. 833. P. de Montfaucon affirms, that the greater part of the munu&s;cripts on parchment which he has &s;een, tho&s;e of an ancient date excepted, are written on parchment from which &s;ome former treati&s;e had been era&s;ed. Mem. de L'Acad. des in&s;cript. tom. ix. p. 325. As the want of materials for writing, is one rea&s;on why &s;o many of the works of the ancients have peri&s;hed, it accounts likewi&s;e for the &s;mall number of manu&s;cripts of any kind, previous to the eleventh century, when they began to multiply from a cau&s;e which &s;hall be mentioned. Hi&s;t. Liter. de France, tom. vi. p. 6. Many circum&s;tances prove the &s;carci|ty of books during the&s;e ages. Private per&s;ons &s;el|dom po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed any books whatever. Even mona&s;teries of con&s;iderable note had only one mi&s;&s;al. Murat. An|tiq. v. ix. p. 789. Lupus, abbot of Ferrieres, in a letter to the Pope, A. D. 855, be&s;eeches him to lend

him a copy of Cicero de Oratore and Quintilian's In|&s;titutions, "for," &s;ays he, "although we have parts of tho&s;e books, there is no compleat copy of them in all France." Murat. Ant. v. iii. p. 835. The price of books became &s;o high, that per&s;ons of a moderate fortune could not afford to purcha&s;e them. The coun|te&s;s of Anjou paid for a copy of the Homilies of Hai|mon, bi&s;hop of Halber&s;tadt, two hundred &s;heep, five quarters of wheat, and the &s;ame quantity of rye and millet. Hi&s;toire Literaire de France par des Religieux Benedictins, tom. vii. p. 3. Even &s;o late as the year 1471, when Louis XI. borrowed the works of Ra&s;is, the Arabian phy&s;ician, from the faculty of me|dicine in Paris, he not only depo&s;ited as a pledge a con&s;iderable quantity of plate, but was obliged to pro|cure a nobleman to join with him as &s;urety in a deed, binding him&s;elf under a great forfeiture to re&s;tore it. Gabr. Naud&egrave; Addit. &agrave; l'hi&s;toire de Louys XI. par Comines edit. de Fre&s;noy, tom. iv. p. 281. Many curious circum&s;tances with re&s;pect to the extravagant price of books in the middle ages, are collected by that indu&s;trious compiler, to whom I refer &s;uch of my readers as deem this &s;mall branch of literary hi&s;tory an object of curio&s;ity. When any per&s;on made a pre&s;ent of a book to a church or a mona&s;tery, in which were the only libraries during the&s;e ages, it was deemed a donative of &s;uch value, that he offered it on the altar <HI>pro remedio animae &s;uae,</HI> in order to obtain the forgive|ne&s;s of his &s;ins.

<P>In the eleventh century, the art of making paper in the manner now become univer&s;al, was invented; by means of that not only the number of manu&s;cripts increa&s;ed, but the &s;tudy of the &s;ciences was wonder|fully facilitated. Murat. ib. p. 871. The invention of the art of making paper, and the invention of the art of printing, are two con&s;iderable events in literary hi&s;tory. It is remarkable that the former preceded the fir&s;t dawning of letters and improvement in know|ledge towards the clo&s;e of the eleventh century; the latter u&s;hered in the light which &s;pread over Europe at the aera of the Reformation.</P>

<P>All the religious maxims and practices of the dark ages are a proof of this. I &s;hall produce one remark|able te&s;timony in confirmation of it, from an author canonized by the church of Rome, St. Eloy or Egidi|us, bi&s;hop of Noyne, in the &s;eventh century. "He is a good chri&s;tian who comes frequently to church; who pre&s;ents the oblation which is offered to God up|on the altar; who doth not ta&s;te of the fruits of his own indu&s;try until he has con&s;ecrated a part of them to God; who, when the holy fe&s;tivals &s;hall approach, lives cha&s;tely even with his own wife during &s;everal days, that with a &s;afe con&s;cience he may draw near to the altar of God; and who, in the la&s;t place, can repeat the Creed and the Lord's Prayer. Redeem then your &s;ouls from de&s;truction while you have the means in your power; offer pre&s;ents and tythes to churchmen; come more frequently to church; hum|bly implore the patronage of the &s;aints; for if you ob&s;erve the&s;e things, you may come with &s;ecurity in the day to the tribunal of the eternal Judge, and &s;ay, "Give to us, O Lord, for we have given unto thee."

<P>IT is no incon&s;iderable misfortune to the church of Rome, who&s;e doctrine of infallibility renders all &s;uch in&s;tituitons and ceremonies as have been once univer|&s;ally received, immutable and everla&s;ting, that &s;he mu&s;t continue to ob&s;erve in enlightened times, tho&s;e rites which were introduced during the ages of dark|ne&s;s

and credulity. What delighted and edified the latter, mu&s;t digu&s;t and &s;hock the former. Many of the&s;e rites appear manife&s;tly to have been introduced by a &s;uper&s;tition of the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t illiberal &s;pecies. Many of them were borrowed, with little variation, from the religious ceremonies e&s;tabli&s;hed among the ancient Heathens. Some were &s;o ridiculous, that if every age did not furni&s;h in&s;tances of the fa&s;cinating influence of &s;uper&s;tition, as well as of the whim&s;ical forms which it a&s;&s;umes, it mu&s;t appear incredible that they &s;hould ever be received or tolerated. In &s;everal churches of France, they celebrated a fe&s;tival in com|memoration of the Virgin Mary's flight into Egypt. It was called the fea&s;t of the A&s;s. A young girl richly dre&s;&s;ed, with a child in her arms, was &s;et upon an a&s;s &s;uperbly capari&s;oned. The a&s;s was led to the altar in &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion. High Ma&s;s was &s;aid with great pomp. The a&s;s was taught to kneel at proper places; a hymn no le&s;s childi&s;h than impious was &s;ung in his prai&s;e: And when the ceremony was ended, the prie&s;t, in&s;tead of the u&s;ual words with which he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the people, brayed three times like an a&s;s; and the people in&s;tead of their u&s;ual re&s;pon&s;e, We ble&s;s the Lord, brayed three times in the &s;ame manner. Du Cange, voc. Fe&s;tum. v. iii. p. 424. This ridiculous cere|mony was not, like the fe&s;tival of fools, and &s;ome other pageants of tho&s;e ages, a mere farcical enter|tainment exhibited in a church and mingled, as was then the cu&s;tom, with an imitation of &s;ome religious rites; it was an act of devotion, performed by the mini&s;ters of religion, and by the authority of the church. However, as this practice did not prevail univer&s;ally in the Catholick church, its ab&s;urdity con|tributed at la&s;t to aboli&s;h it.</P>

<P>AS there is no event in the hi&s;tory of mankind more &s;ingular than that of the Cru&s;ades, every circum|&s;tance that tends to explain or to give any rational account of this extraordinary frenzy of the human mind is intere&s;ting. I have a&s;&s;erted in the text, that
<PB N="199" REF="011837_0219_0F9D8660EEC651C8">
the minds of men were prepared gradually for the amazing effort which they made in con&s;equence of the exhortations of Peter the hermit, by &s;everal occur|rences previous to his time. A more particular detail of this curious and ob&s;cure part of hi&s;tory, may per|haps appear to &s;ome of my readers to be of importance. That the end of the world was expected about the clo&s;e of the tenth and beginning of the eleventh cen|tury; and that this occa&s;ioned a general alarm, is evi|dent from the authors to whom I refer in the text. This belief was &s;o univer&s;al and &s;o &s;trong, that it min|gled it&s;elf with their civil tran&s;actions. Many char|ters in the latter part of the tenth century began in this manner: "Apropinquante mundi termino," &amp;c. As the end of the world is now at hand, and by various calamities and judgments the &s;igns of its approach are now manife&s;t. Hi&s;t. de Langued. par. D. D. de Vic Vai&s;ette, tom. ii. Preuves, p. 86, 89, 90, 117, 158, &amp;c. One effect of this was, that a great number of pilgrims re&s;orted to Jeru&s;alem, with a re&s;olution to die there, or to wait the coming of the Lord; Kings, Earls, Marqui&s;&s;es, Bi&s;hops, and even a great number of women, be&s;ides per&s;ons of inferior rank, flocked to the Holy Land. Glaber. Rodulph. Hi&s;t. chez Bou|quet Recueil, tom. x. p. 50, 52. Another hi&s;torian mentions a va&s;t cavalcade of pilgrims who accompa|nied the count of Angouleme to Jeru&s;alem in the year 1026.

D. 1010, that all the forces of Chri&s;tendom were to unite, in order to drive the Mahometans out of Pale&s;tine. Chron. Ademari ap. Bouquet, tom. x. p. 152. It is evident from all the&s;e particulars, that the ideas which led the Cru&s;aders to undertake their wild enterprize were gradually formed; &s;o that the univer&s;al concour&s;e to the &s;tandard of the cro&s;s when erected by Urban II. will appear le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ing.</P>
<P>If the various circum&s;tances which I have enume|rated in this note, as well as in the hi&s;tory, are &s;uffici|ent to account for the ardour with which &s;uch va&s;t numbers engaged in &s;uch a dangerous undertaking, the exten&s;ive privileges and immunities granted to tho&s;e who a&s;&s;umed the cro&s;s, &s;erve to account for the long continuance of this &s;pirit in Europe. 1.

Gui|bert. Abbas, p. 480.

Willierm Tyrien&s;is ap. Bongar&s;. vol. ii. p. 641. The hi&s;to|ries of the Cru&s;ades written by modern authors, who are apt to &s;ub&s;titute the ideas and maxims of their own age in the place of tho&s;e which influenced the per&s;ons who&s;e actions they attempt to relate, convey a very imperfect notion of the &s;pirit at that time predominant in Europe. The original hi&s;torians, who were ani|mated them&s;elves with the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions which po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed their contemporaries, exhibit to us a more &s;trik|ing picture of the times and manners which they de|&s;cribe. The enthu&s;iatic rapture with which they ac|count for the effects of the Pope's di&s;cour&s;e in the coun|cil of Clermont; the exultation with which they men|tion the numbers who devoted them&s;elves to this holy warfare; the confidence with which they rely on the divine protection; the extacy of joy with which they de&s;cribe their taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the holy city, will enable us to conceive in &s;ome degree the extravagance of that zeal which agitated the minds of men with &s;uch violence, and will &s;ugge&s;t as many &s;ingular <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">+flections to a philo&s;opher, as any occurrence in the hi&s;tory of mankind.&mdash;It is unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;elect the particular pa&s;&s;ages in the &s;everal hi&s;torians which con|firm this ob&s;ervation. But left the&s;e authors may be &s;u&s;pected of adorning their narrative with any exag|gerated de&s;cription, I &s;hall appeal to one of the lead|ers who conducted the enterprize. There is extant a

from Stephen, the Earl of Chartres and Blois, to Adela his wife, in which he gives her an account of the progre&s;s of the Cru&s;aders. He de&s;cribes the Cru|&s;aders as the cho&s;en army of Chri&s;t, as the &s;ervants and &s;oldiers of God, as men who marched under the immediate protection of the Almighty, being conduct|ed by his hand to the victory and conque&s;t. He &s;peaks of the Turks as accur&s;ed, &s;acrilegious, and de|voted by Heaven to de&s;truction; and when he men|tions the &s;oldiers in the Chri&s;tian army who had died, or were killed, he is confident that their &s;ouls were admitted directly into the joys of Paradi&s;e. Dacherii Specilegium, vol. iv. p. 257.</P>
<P>THE expence of conducting numerous bodies of men from Europe to A&s;ia, mu&s;t have been exce&s;&s;ive, and the difficulty of rai&s;ing the nece&s;&s;ary &s;ums mu&s;t have been proportionally great, during ages when the public revenues in every nation of Europe were ex|tremely &s;mall. Some account is pre&s;erved of the ex|pedients employed by Humbert II. Dauphin of Vien|ne, in order to levy the money requi&s;ite towards equipping him for the Cru&s;ade, A. D. 1346. The&s;e I &s;hall mention, as they tend to &s;hew the con&s;iderable influence which the Cru&s;ades had, both on the &s;tate of property and of civil government. 1. He expo&s;ed to &s;ale part of his domains; and as the price was de&s;tined for &s;uch a &s;acred &s;ervice, he obtained the con&s;ent of the French King, of whom the&s;e lands were held, ratifying the alienation. Hi&s;t. de Dauphin&egrave; tom. i. p. 332. 335.&mdash;2. He i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, in which he promi&s;ed to grant new privileges to the nobles, as well as new immunities to the cities and towns, in his territories, in con&s;ideration of certain &s;ums which they were in&s;tantly to pay on that account. Ibid. tom. ii. p. 512. Many of the charters of communi|ty, which I &s;hall mention in another note, were ob|tained in this manner.&mdash;3.

<P>THE u&s;ual method of forming an opinion concern|ing the comparative &s;tate of manners in two different nations, is by attending to the facts which hi&s;to|rians relate concerning each of them. Various pa&s;&s;ages might be &s;elected from the Byzantin hi&s;tori|ans, de&s;cribing the &s;plendor and magnificence of the Greek empire. P. de Montfaucon has produced from the writings of St. Chry&s;o&s;tom a very full account of the elegance and luxury of the Greeks in his age. That father in his &s;ermons enters into &s;uch details concern|ing the manners and cu&s;toms of his contemporaries, as appear &s;trange in di&s;cour&s;es from the pulpit. P. de Montfaucon has collected the&s;e de&s;criptions, and ranged them under different heads. The court of the more early Greek Emperors &s;eems to have re&s;embled tho&s;e of Ea&s;tern monarchs, both in magnificence and in corruption of manners. The Emperors in the ele|venth century, though inferior in power, did not
<PB N="204" REF="011837_0224_0F9D86655E038C48">
yield to them in o&s;tentation and &s;plendor. Memoires de l'Acad. des In&s;cript. tom. xx. p. 197.&mdash;But we may decide concerning the comparative &s;tate of man|ners in the Ea&s;tern Empire, and among the nations in the we&s;t of Europe by another method, which if not more certain, is at lea&s;t more &s;triking. As Con&s;tan|tinople was the place of rendezvous for all the armies of the cru&s;aders, this brought together the people, of the ea&s;t and we&s;t as to one great interview. There are extant &s;everal contemporary authors, both among the Greeks and Latins, who were witne&s;&s;es of this &s;in|gular congre&s;s of people formerly &s;trangers, in a great mea&s;ure, to each other. They de&s;cribe with &s;impli|city and candour, the impre&s;&s;ion which that new &s;pec|tacle made upon their own minds. This may be con&s;idered as the mo&s;t lively and ju&s;t picture of the real character and manners of each people. When the Greeks &s;peak of the Franks, they de&s;cribe them as barbarians, fierce, illiterate, impetuous and &s;avage. They a&s;&s;ume a tone of &s;uperiority, as a more poli&s;hed people, acquainted with the arts both of government and of elegance, of which the others were ignorant. It is thus Anna Comnena de&s;cribes the manners of the Latins, Alexias, p. 224, 231, 237. ap. Byz. Script. vol. xi. She always treats them with contempt as a rude people, the very mention of who&s;e names was &s;ufficient to contaminate the beauty and elegance of hi&s;tory, p. 229. Nicetas Choniatas inveighs again&s;t them with &s;till more violence, and gives an account of their ferocity and deva&s;tations, in terms not unlike tho&s;e which preceding hi&s;torians had employed in de|&s;cribing the incur&s;ions of the Goths and Vandals. Ni|cet. Chon. ap. Byz. Script. vol. iii. p. 302, &amp;c. But, on the other hand, the Latin hi&s;torians were &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment at the magnificence, wealth. and elegance which they di&s;covered in the Ea&s;tern em|pire. "O what a va&s;t city is Con&s;tantinople (ex|claims Fulcherius Carnoten&s;is, when he fir&s;t beheld it) and how beautiful! How many mona&s;teries are there in it, and how many palaces built with wonder|ful art! How many manufactures are there in the ci|ty, amazing to behold! It would be a&s;toni&s;hing to

Fulcher. ap. Bongars, vol. i. p. 386. Willermus Archbi&s;hop of Tyre, the mo&s;t intelligent hi&s;torian of the cru&s;ades, takes frequent oc|ca&s;ion to de&s;cribe the elegance and &s;plendour of the court of Con&s;tantinople, and adds, that what they ob&s;erved there exceeded any idea which they could have formed of it, no&s;trarum enim rerum modum &amp; dignitatem excedunt, Willerm. Tyr. ap. Bong. vol. ii. p. 657. 664. Guntherus, a French monk who wrote a hi&s;tory of the conque&s;t of Con&s;tantinople by the cru&s;aders in the thirteenth century, &s;peaks of the magnificence of that city in the &s;ame tone of admirati|on, "Structurum autem Aedificiorum in corpore ci|vitatis, in eccle&s;iis videlicit, &amp; turibus, &amp; in domibus magnatorum, vix ullus vel de&s;cribere pote&s;t, vel cre|dere de&s;cribenti, ni&s;i qui ea oculata fide cognoverit." Hi&s;t. Con&s;tantinop. ap. Cani&s;ii Lectiones Antiquas. fol. Antw. 1725. vol. iv. p. 14. Geoffrey de Ville|hardouin, a nobleman of high rank, and accu&s;tomed to all the magnificence then known in the we&s;t, de|&s;cribes, in &s;imilar terms, the a&s;toni&s;hment and admi|ration of &s;uch of his fellow &s;oldiers who beheld Con|&s;tantinople for the fir&s;t time: "They could not have believed, &s;ays he, that there was a city &s;o beautiful and rich in the whole world. When they viewed its high walls, its lofty towers, its rich palaces, its &s;u|perb churches, all appeared &s;o great that they could have formed no conception of this &s;overeign city, unle&s;s they had &s;een it with their own eyes." Hi&s;|toire de la Conquete de Con&s;tant p. 49. From the&s;e undi&s;gui&s;ed repre&s;entations of their own feelings, it is evident, that to the Greeks, the Latins appeared to be a race of rude, unpoli&s;hed barbarians; whereas the latter, how much &s;oever they might contemn the un|warlike character of the former, could not help re|garding them as far &s;uperior them&s;elves in elegance and arts&mdash;That the &s;tate of government and manners was much more improved in Italy than in the other countries of Europe is evident not only from the facts

recorded in hi&s;tory, but it appears that the more in|telligent leaders of the cru&s;aders were &s;truck with the difference.

<P>The different &s;teps taken by the cities of Italy in or|der to extend their power and dominion are remarka|ble. As &s;oon as their liberties were e&s;tabli&s;hed, and they began to feel their own importance, they endea|voured to render them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the territory round their walls. Under the Romans, when cities enjoyed municipal privileges and juri&s;diction, the cir|cumjacent lands belonged to each town, and were the property of the community. But as it was not the ge|nius of the feudal policy to encourage cities, or to &s;hew any regard for their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and immunities, the&s;e lands had been &s;eized, and &s;hared among the conquerors. The barons to whom they were grant|ed, erected their ca&s;tles almo&s;t at the gates of the city, and exerci&s;ed their juri&s;diction there. Under pretence of covering their ancient property, many of the cities in Italy attacked the&s;e trouble&s;ome neighbours, and di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them, annexed their territories to the communities, and made thereby a con&s;iderable additi|on to their power. Several in&s;tances of this occur in the eleventh, and beginning of the twelfth centuries. Murat. antiq. Ital. vol. iv. p. 159, &amp;c. Their am|bition increa&s;ing together with their power, they af|terwards attacked &s;everal barons &s;ituated at a great di&s;|tance from them, and obliged the&s;e to engage that
<PB N="207" REF="011837_0227_0F9D8666F09823C8">
they &s;hould become members of their community; that they &s;hould take the oath of fidelity to their ma|gi&s;trates; that they &s;hould &s;ubject their lands to all burthens and taxes impo&s;ed by common con&s;ent; that they &s;hould defend the community again&s;t all its ene|mies; and that they &s;hould re&s;ide within the city dur|ing a certain &s;pecified time in each year. Murat. ibid. 163. This &s;ubjection of the nobility to the munici|pal government e&s;tabli&s;hed in cities, became almo&s;t univer&s;al, and was often extremely grevious to per|&s;ons accu&s;tomed to con&s;ider them&s;elves as independ|ant. Otto Fri&s;ingen&s;is thus de&s;cribes the &s;tate of Italy under Frederick I. "The cities &s;o much affect liber|ty, and are &s;o &s;olicitous to avoid the in&s;olence of power, that almo&s;t all of them have thrown off every other authority, and are governed by their own ma|gi&s;trates. In&s;omuch that all that country is now fil|led with free cities, each of which have compelled their bi&s;hops to re&s;ide within their walls, and there is &s;carce any nobleman, how great &s;oever his power may be, who is not &s;ubject to the laws and govern|ment of &s;ome city. De Ge&s;tis Frider. I. Imp. lib. ii. c. 13. p. 453. In another place he ob&s;erves of the Marquis of Mont&s;errat that he was almo&s;t the only Italian baron, who had pre&s;erved his independance, and had not become &s;ubject to the laws of any city. See al&s;o Muratori Antichita E&s;ten&s;i, vol. i. p. 411, 412. That &s;tate into which &s;ome of the nobles were compelled to enter, others embraced from choice. They ob&s;erved that high degree of &s;ecurity as well as of credit and e&s;timation which the growing wealth and dominion of the great communities procured to all the members of them. They were de&s;irous to par|take of the&s;e, and to put them&s;elves under &s;uch pow|erful protection. With this view they voluntarily became citizens of the towns in which their lands were mo&s;t contiguous, and abandoning their ancient ca&s;tles, took up their re&s;idence in the cities at lea&s;t during part of the year. Several deeds are &s;till extant, by which &s;ome of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious families in Italy are a&s;&s;ociated as citizens of different cities. Murat. ib. p. 165, &amp;c. A charter by which Atto de Macerata is

admitted as a citizen of O&s;imo, A. D. 1198. in the Marcha di Ancona is &s;till extant. In this he &s;tipulates, that he will acknowledge him&s;elf to be a burge&s;s of that community; that he will to the utmo&s;t of his power, promote its honour and welfare; that he will obey his magi&s;trates; that he will enter into no league with its enemies; that he will re&s;ide in the town dur|ing two months in every year, or for a longer time if required by the magi&s;trates. The community, on the other hand, take him, his family, and friends, under their protection, and engage to defend him again&s;t every enemy. Fr. Ant. Zacharias Anecdota medii aevi. Aug. Taurm. 1755. fol. p. 66. This privi|lege was deemed &s;o important, that not only laymen, but eccle&s;ia&s;ticks of the highe&s;t rank conde&s;cended to be adopted as members of the great communities, in hopes of enjoying the &s;afety and dignity which that conferred. Murat. ib. 179. Before the in&s;titution of communities, per&s;ons of noble birth had no other re&s;idence but their ca&s;tles. They kept their petty courts there; and the cities were de&s;erted, having hardly any inhabitants, but &s;laves or per&s;ons of low condition. But in con&s;equence of the practice which I have mentioned, cities not only became more popu|lous, but were filled with inhabitants of better rank; and a cu&s;tom, which &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in Italy, was then introduced, that all families of di&s;tinction re&s;ide more con&s;tantly in the great towns, than is u&s;ual in other parts of Europe. As cities acquired new con&s;iderati|on and dignity by the acce&s;&s;ion of &s;uch citizens, they became more &s;olicitous to pre&s;erve their liberty and in|dependance. The Emperors, as &s;overeigns, had an|ciently a palace in almo&s;t every great city of Italy; when they vi&s;ited that country they were accu&s;tomed to re&s;ide in the&s;e, and the troops which accompanied them were quartered in the hou&s;es of the citizens. This the citizens con&s;idered both as ignominious and dangerous. They could not help con&s;idering it as receiving a ma&s;ter and an enemy within their walls. They laboured therefore to get free of this &s;ubjection. Some cities prevailed on the Emperors to engage that they &s;hould never enter their gates, but take up
<PB N="209" REF="011837_0229_0F9D86686F909AF0">
their re&s;idence without the walls, Chart. Hen. IV. Murat. ib. p. 24. Others obtained the imperial li|cence to pull down the palace &s;ituated within their li|berties, on condition that they built another in the &s;uburbs for the reception of the Emperor. Chart. Hen. IV. Murat. ib. p. 25. The&s;e various encroach|ments of the Italian cities alarmed the Emperors, and put them on &s;chemes for re-e&s;tabli&s;hing the imperial juri&s;diction over them on its ancient footing. Frede|rick Barbaro&s;&s;a engaged in this enterprize with great ardour. The free cities of Italy joined together in a general league, and &s;tood on their defence; and after a long conte&s;t, carried on with alternate &s;ucce&s;s, a &s;olemn treaty of peace was concluded at Con&s;tance, A. D. 1183, by which all the privileges and immu|nities granted by former Emperors to the principal cities in Italy were confirmed and ratified. Murat. di&s;&s;ert. XLVIII. This treaty of Con&s;tance was con&s;i|dered as &s;uch an important article in the juri&s;prudence of the middle ages, that it is u&s;ually publi&s;hed toge|ther with the Libri Feudorum at the end of the Cor|pus Juris Civilis. The treaty &s;ecured privileges of great importance to the confederate cities, and though it re&s;erved a con&s;iderable degree of authority and ju|ri&s;diction to the Empire, yet the cities per&s;evered with &s;uch vigour in their efforts in order to extend their immunities, and the conjunctures in which they made them were &s;o favourable, that, before the conclu&s;ion of the thirteenth century, mo&s;t of the great cities in Italy had &s;haken off all marks of &s;ubjection to the Em|pire, and were become independant &s;overeign repub|lics. It is not requi&s;ite that I &s;hould trace the various &s;teps by which they advanced to this high degree of power &s;o fatal to the Empire, and &s;o beneficial to the cau&s;e of liberty in Italy. Muratori with his u&s;ual in|du&s;try has collected many original papers which illu&s;|trate this curious and little known part of hi&s;tory. Murat. Antiq. Ital. Di&s;&s;ert. L. See al&s;o Jo. Bapt.

<HEAD>NOTE XVI. [Q]. SECT. I.</HEAD>
<P>LONG before the in&s;titution of communities in France, charters of immunity or Franchi&s;e were grant|ed to &s;ome towns and villages by the lords on whom they depended. But the&s;e are very different from &s;uch as became common in the twelfth and thirteenth cen|turies. They did not erect the&s;e towns into corpora|tions; they did not not e&s;tabli&s;h a municipal govern|ment; they did not grant them the privilege of bear|ing arms. They contained nothing more than a ma|numi&s;ion of the inhabitants from the yoke of &s;ervi|tude; an exemption from certain &s;ervices which were oppre&s;&s;ive and ignominious; and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a fixed tax or rent which they were to pay to their Lord in place of impo&s;itions which he could formerly lay upon them at plea&s;ure. Two charters of this kind to two villages in the county of Rou&s;illan, one A. D. 974. the other A. D. 1025, are &s;till extant. Petr. de Marca <HI>Marca,</HI> &s;ive limes Hi&s;panicus. app. p. 909. 1038. Such conce&s;&s;ions, it is probable, were not unknown in other parts of Europe, and may be con&s;idered as a &s;tep towards the more exten&s;ive privileges conferred by Louis the Gro&s;s on the towns within his domains. The communities in France never a&s;pired to the &s;ame independance with tho&s;e in Italy. They acquired new privileges, and immunities, but the right of &s;overeign|ty remained entire to the King or baron within who&s;e territories the re&s;pective cities were &s;ituated, and from whom they received the charter of their freedom. A great number of the&s;e charters granted both by the Kings of France, and by their great va&s;&s;als are pub|li&s;hed by M. D'Achery in his Specilegium, and many are found in the collection of the Ordinances des Rois de France. The&s;e convey a very &s;triking repre&s;enta|tion of the wretched condition of cities previous to the in&s;titution of communities, when they were &s;ubject to the judges appointed by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;uperior lords of whom they held, and had &s;carce any other law but their will. Each conce&s;&s;ion in the&s;e charters mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a grant of &s;ome new privilege which the people did not formerly enjoy, and each regulation as a method
<PB N="211" REF="011837_0231_0F9D8669EF619F98">
of redre&s;&s;ing &s;ome grievance under which they former|ly laboured. The charters of communities contain likewi&s;e the fir&s;t expedients employed for the intro|duction of equal laws, and regular government. On both the&s;e accounts they merit particular attention, and therefore in&s;tead of referring my readers to the many bulky volumes in which they are &s;cattered, I &s;hall give them a view of &s;ome of the mo&s;t important articles in the&s;e charters ranged under two general heads. I. Such as re&s;pect per&s;onal &s;afety. II. Such as re&s;pect the &s;ecurity of property.</P>
<P N="1">I. DURING that &s;tate of turbulence and di&s;order which the corruption of the feudal government intro|duced into Europe, per&s;onal &s;afety was the chief object of every individual; and as the great military barons alone were able to give &s;ufficient protection to their va&s;&s;als, this was one great &s;ource of their power and authority. But, by the in&s;titution of communities, effectual provi&s;ion was made for the &s;afety of individu|als independant of the nobles. For, 1. the fundamen|tal article in every charter was, that all the members of it bound them&s;elves by oath to a&s;&s;i&s;t, defend, and &s;tand by each other again&s;t all aggre&s;&s;ors, and that they &s;hould not &s;uffer any per&s;on to injure, di&s;tre&s;s, or mo|le&s;t, any of their fellow citizens. D'Acher. Specil. x. 642. xi. 341, &amp;c.&mdash;2. Whoever re&s;ided in any town which was made free, was obliged under a &s;evere pe|nalty to accede to the community, and to take part in the mutual defence of its members. D'Acher. Spec. xi. 344.&mdash;3. The communities had the privilege of carrying arms; of making war on their private ene|mies; and of executing by military force any &s;entence which their magi&s;trates pronounced. D'Ach. Specil. x. 643, 644. xi. 343.&mdash;4. The practice of making &s;a|tisfaction by a pecuniary compen&s;ation for murder, a&s;&s;ault, or other acts of violence, mo&s;t incon&s;i&s;tent with the order of &s;ociety, and the &s;afety of individu|als, was aboli&s;hed, and &s;uch as committed the&s;e crimes were puni&s;hed capitally, or with rigour adequate to their guilt. D'Ach. xi. 362. Miraei opera Diplomati|ca, i. 292.&mdash;5. No member of a community was bound to ju&s;tify or defend him&s;elf by battle, or combat, but
<PB N="212" REF="011837_0232_0F9D866AB0762890">
if he was charged with any crime, he could be convic|ted only by the evidence of witne&s;&s;es, and the regular cour&s;e of legal proceedings. Miraeus, ibid. D'Ach. xi. 375, 349. Ordon. tom. iii. 265.&mdash;6. If any man &s;u&s;pected him&s;elf to be in danger from the malice or enmity of another, upon his making oath to that ef|fect before a magi&s;trate, the per&s;on &s;u&s;pected was bound under a &s;evere penalty to give &s;ecurity for his peaceable behaviour. D'Ach. xi. 346. This is the &s;ame &s;pecies of &s;ecurity which is &s;till known in Scotland under the name of <HI>Lawburrows.</HI> In France it was fir&s;t introdu|ced among the inhabitants of communities, and hav|ing been found to contribute con&s;iderably towards per|&s;onal &s;afety, it was extended to all the other members of &s;ociety. E&s;tabli&s;&s;emens de St. Louis, liv. i. cap. 28. ap. Du Cange vie de St. Louis, p. 15.</P>
<P N="2">II. THE provi&s;ions in the charters of communities concerning the &s;ecurity of property are not le&s;s con&s;i|derable than tho&s;e re&s;pecting per&s;onal &s;afety. By the ancient law of France no per&s;on could be arre&s;ted or confined in pri&s;on on account of any private debt. Ordon. des Rois de France, tom. i. p. 72, 80. If any per&s;on was arre&s;ted upon any pretext, but his having been guilty of a capital crime, it was lawful to re&s;cue him out of the hands of the officers who had &s;eized him. Ordon. iii. p. 17. Freedom from arre&s;t on ac|count of debt &s;eems likewi&s;e to have been enjoyed in other countries. Gudenus Sylloge Diplom. 473. In &s;ociety, while it remained in its rude&s;t and mo&s;t &s;imple form, debt &s;eems to have been con&s;idered as an obligation merely per&s;onal. Men had made &s;ome progre&s;s to|wards refinement before creditors acquired a right of &s;eizing the property of their debtors in order to reco|ver payment. The expedients for this purpo&s;e were all introduced originally in communities, and we can trace the gradual progre&s;s of them. 1. The &s;imple&s;t and mo&s;t obvious &s;pecies of &s;ecurity was, that the per|&s;on who &s;old any commodity &s;hould receive a pledge from him who bought it, which he re&s;tored upon re|ceiving payment. Of this cu&s;tom there are ve&s;tiges in &s;everal charters of community. D'Ach. ix. 185. xi. 377.&mdash;2. When no pledge was given, and the debtor
<PB N="213" REF="011837_0233_0F9D866C6B2E7950">
became refractory or in&s;olvent, the creditor was al|lowed to &s;eize his effects with a &s;trong hand, and by his private authority; the citizens of Paris are war|ranted by the royal mandate, "ut ubicumque, et quo|cumque modo potuerunt, tantum capiant, unde pe|cuniam &s;ibi debitam integr&egrave; &amp; plenari&egrave; habeant, &amp; in|de &s;ibi invicem adjutores exi&s;tant." Ordon. &amp;c. tom. i. p. 6. This rude practice, &s;uitable only to the vio|lence of a &s;tate of nature, was tolerated longer than one can conceive to be po&s;&s;ible in any &s;ociety, where laws and order were at all known. The ordonance authorizing it was i&s;&s;ued, A. D. 1134. and that which corrects the law, and prohibits creditors from &s;eizing the effects of their debtors, unle&s;s by a warrrnt from a magi&s;trate, and under his in&s;pection, was not pub|li&s;hed until the year 1351. Ordon. tom. ii. 438. It is probable, however, that men were taught, by ob|&s;erving the di&s;orders which the former mode of pro|ceeding occa&s;ioned, to correct it in practice long be|fore a remedy was provided by a law to that effect. Every di&s;cerning reader will apply this ob&s;ervation to many other cu&s;toms and practices which I have menti|oned. New cu&s;toms are not always to be a&s;cribed to the laws which authorize them. The&s;e &s;tatutes only give a le|gal &s;anction to &s;uch things, as the experience of man|kind has previou&s;ly found to be proper and beneficial. 3. As &s;oon as the interpo&s;ition of the magi&s;trate became requi&s;ite, regular provi&s;ion was made for attaching or di&s;training the moveable effects of a debtor; and if his moveable were not &s;ufficient to di&s;charge the debt, his immoveable property, or e&s;tate in land, was liable to the &s;ame di&s;tre&s;s, and was &s;old for the benefit of his creditor. D'Ach. ix. p. 184, 185. xi. p. 348. 380. As this regulation afforded the mo&s;t compleat &s;ecurity to the creditor, it was con&s;idered as &s;o &s;evere, that humanity pointed out &s;everal limitations in the exe|cution of it. Creditors were prohibited from &s;eizing the wearing apparel of their debtors, their beds, the door of their hou&s;e, their in&s;truments of hu&s;bandry, &amp;c. D'Ach. ix. 184. xi. 377. Upon the &s;ame princi|ples, when the power of di&s;training effects became more general, the hor&s;e and arms of a gentleman
<PB N="214" REF="011837_0234_0F9D866CF3CDC7A0">
could not be &s;eized. D'Ach. ix. 185. As hunting was the favourite amu&s;ement of martial nobles, the Emperor Ludovicus Pius prohibited the &s;eizing of a hawk, on account of any compo&s;ition or debt. Capi|tul. lib. iv. &sect;. 21. But if the debtor had no other move|ables, even the&s;e privileged articles might be &s;eized. 4. In order to render the &s;ecurity of property compleat within a community, every per&s;on who was admitted a member of it, was obliged to buy or build a hou&s;e, or to purcha&s;e lands, within its precincts, or at lea&s;t to bring into town a con&s;iderable portion of his move|ables <HI>per quae ju&s;titiari po&s;&s;it, &s;i quid fort&eacute; in eum querel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> evenerit.</HI> D'Ach. xi. 326. Ordon. i. 367. Libertates S. Georgii. de E&s;peranchia. Hi&s;t. de Dauphine, tom. i. p. 26.&mdash;5. That &s;ecurity might be as perfect as po&s;|&s;ible; in &s;ome towns, the members of the community &s;eem to to have been bound for each other. D'Ach. x. 644.&mdash;6. All que&s;tions with re&s;pect to property, were tried within the community by magi&s;trates and judges, which the citizens elected or appointed. Their deci&s;ions were more equal and fixed, than the &s;enten|ces which depended on the capricious and arbitrary will of a baron, who thought him&s;elf &s;uperior to all laws. D'Ach. x. 644, 646. xi. 344. &amp; pa&s;&s;im. Ordon. iii. 204. 7. No member of a community could be burdened by any arbitrary tax; for the &s;uperior lord who granted the charter of community, accepted of a fixed cen&s;us or duty in lieu of all demands, Ordon. t. iii. 204. Li|bertates de Calma. Hi&s;t. de Dauphine, tom. i. p. 19. Libert. St. Georgii de E&s;peranchia, ibid. p. 26. Nor could the members of a community be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by an unequal impo&s;ition of the &s;um to be levied on the com|munity. Regulations are in&s;erted in the charters of &s;ome communities concerning the method of determi|ning the quota of any tax to be levied on each inhabi|tant. D'Ach. xi. 350, 365. St. Louis publi&s;hed an ordonance concerning this matter, which extended to all the communities. Ordon. t. i. 186. The&s;e regula|tions are extremely favourable to liberty, as they ve&s;t the power of proportioning the taxes in a certain num|ber of citizens cho&s;en out of each pari&s;h, who were bound by &s;olemn oath to decide according to ju&s;tice.
<PB N="215" REF="011837_0235_0F9D866DBAFC4BC8">
That the more perfect &s;ecurity of property was one great object of tho&s;e who in&s;tituted communities, we learn, not only from the nature of the thing, but from the expre&s;s words of &s;everal charters, of which I &s;hall only mention that granted by Alienor, Queen of En|gland and Dutche&s;s of Guienne, to the community of Poitiers, "ut &s;ua propria melius defendre po&s;&s;int, &amp; magis integr&egrave; cu&s;todire." Du Cange voc. <HI>Communia,</HI> v. ii. p. 863.&mdash;Such are &s;ome of the capital regulations e&s;tabli&s;hed in communities during the twelfth and thir|teenth centuries. The&s;e may be con&s;idered as the fir&s;t rudiments of law and order, and contributed greatly to introduce regular government among all the mem|bers of &s;ociety. As &s;oon as communities were in&s;titu|ted, high &s;entiments of liberty began to appear. When Humbert, lord of Beaujeu, upon granting a charter of community to the town of Belleville, exacted of the inhabitants an oath of fidelity to him&s;elf and &s;ucce&s;|&s;ors, they &s;tipulated, on their part, that he &s;hould &s;wear to maintain their franchi&s;es and liberties; and for their greater &s;ecurity, they obliged him to bring twenty gentlemen to take the &s;ame oath, and to be bound together with him. D'Ach. ix. 183. In the &s;ame manner, the lord of Moirens in Dauphin&egrave; pro|duced a certain number of per&s;ons as his &s;ureties for the ob&s;ervation of the articles, contained in the char|ter of community to that town. The&s;e were bound to &s;urrender them&s;elves pri&s;oners to the inhabitants of Moirens, if their liege lord &s;hould violate any of their franchi&s;es, and they promi&s;ed to remain in cu&s;tody until he &s;hould grant them redre&s;s. Hi&s;t. de Dau|phin&egrave;, tom. i. p. 17. If the mayor or chief magi|&s;trate of a town did any injury to a citizen, he was obliged to give &s;ecurity for his appearance in judg|ment, in the &s;ame manner as a private per&s;on; and if ca&s;t, was liable to the &s;ame penalty. D'Ach. ix. 183. The&s;e are ideas of equality uncommon in the feudal times. Communities were &s;o favourable to freedom, that they were di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>Libertates.</HI> Du Cange, v. ii. p. 863. They were, at fir&s;t ex|tremely odious to the nobles, who fore&s;aw what a check they mu&s;t prove to their power and dominati|on

Guibert Abbot of Nogent calls them execrable inventions, by which, contrary to law and ju&s;tice, &s;laves withdrew them&s;elves from that obedience which they owed to their ma&s;ters. Du Cange, ib. 862. The zeal with which &s;ome of the nobles and powerful eccle&s;ia&s;ticks oppo&s;ed the e&s;tabli&s;hment of communi|ties, and endeavoured to circum&s;cribe their privileges, was extraordinary. A &s;triking in&s;tance of this oc|curs in the conte&s;ts between the archbi&s;hop of Reims, and the inhabitants of that community. It was the chief bu&s;ine&s;s of every archbi&s;hop, during a con&s;ide|rable time, to abridge the rights and juri&s;diction of the community; and the great object of the citizens, e&s;pecially when the &s;ee was vacant, to maintain, to recover, and to extend their juri&s;diction.

<P>THE ob&s;ervations which I have made concerning the &s;tate of cities, and the condition of their inhabi|tants, are confirmed by innumerable pa&s;&s;ages in the hi&s;torians and laws of the middle ages. It is not im|probable, however, that &s;ome cities of the fir&s;t order were in a better &s;tate, and enjoyed a &s;uperior degree of liberty. Under the Roman government, the mu|nicipal government e&s;tabli&s;hed in cities was extremely favourable to liberty. The juri&s;diction of the &s;enate in each corporation, and the privileges of the ci|tizens, were both exten&s;ive. There is rea&s;on to be|lieve, that &s;ome of the greater cities which e&s;caped the de&s;tructive rage of the barbarous nations, &s;till retain|ed their ancient form of government, at lea&s;t in a great mea&s;ure. They were governed by a council of citizens, and by magi&s;trates whom they them&s;elves elected. Very &s;trong pre&s;umptions in favour of this opinion; are produced by M. l' Abb&eacute; De Bos. Hi&s;t. Crit. de la Mon. Franc. tom. i. p. 18, &amp;c. tom. ii. p. 524. edit. 1742. It appears from &s;ome of the charters of communities to cities, granted in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, that they only confirm the privileges po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the inhabitants, previous to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the community. D'Acher. er. Specileg. vol. xi. p. 345. Other cities claimed

<P>HAVING given a full account of the e&s;tabli&s;hment, as well as effects of communities in Italy and France, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to enquire with &s;ome attention, in|to the progre&s;s of cities and of municipal government in Germany. The ancient Germans had no cities. Even in their hamlets or villages, they did not build their hou&s;es contiguous to each other. Tac. de Mor. Germ. cap. 16. They con&s;idered it as a badge of &s;ervitude, to be obliged to dwell in a city &s;urrounded with walls. When one of their tribes had &s;haken off the Roman yoke, their countrymen required of them, as an evidence of their having recovered liberty, to demoli&s;h the walls of a town which the Romans had built in their country. Even the fierce&s;t animals, &s;aid they, lo&s;e their &s;pirit and courage when they are con|fined. Tacit. Hi&s;tor. lib. iv. c. 64. The Romans built &s;everal cities of note on the banks of the Rhine. But in all the va&s;t countries from that river to the coa&s;ts of the Baltic, there was hardly one city previ|ous to the ninth century of the Chri&s;tian aera. Con|ringius Exercitatio de Urbibus Germaniae Open. vol. i. &sect; 25, 27, 31, &amp;c. Heineccius differs from Con|ringius with re&s;pect to this. But even after allowing to his arguments and authorities their utmo&s;t force, they prove only, that there were a few places in tho&s;e exten&s;ive regions, on which &s;ome hi&s;torians have be|&s;towed the name of towns Elem.

His &s;ucce&s;&s;ors increa&s;ed the number of the&s;e; and as the bi&s;hops fixed their re&s;idence in the&s;e cities and performed religious functions there, that induced many people to &s;ettle in them. Conring. ibid. &sect; 48. But Henry, &s;irnamed the Fowler, who began his reign A. D. 920, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as the great founder of the cities in Germany. The Empire was at that time infe&s;ted by the incur&s;ions of the hungarians and other barbarous people. In order to oppo&s;e them, Henry encouraged his &s;ubjects to &s;et|tle in cities which he &s;urrounded with walls and tow|ers. He enjoined or per&s;uaded a certain propor|tion of the nobility to fix their re&s;idence in the towns, and thus rendered the condition of citizens more ho|nourable than it had been formerly. Wittikindus An|nal. lib. i. ap. Conring. &sect;. 82. From this period the number of cities continued to encrea&s;e, and they be|came more populous and more wealthy. But cities were &s;till de&s;titute of municipal liberty or juri&s;diction. Such of them as were &s;ituated in the Imperial deme&s;nes, were &s;ubject to the Emperors, and their <HI>Comites, Mi&s;&s;i,</HI> and other judges pre&s;ided in them, and di&s;pen&s;ed ju&s;|tice.

of every kind, eccle&s;ia&s;tical as well as civil&punc; in cities. In the eleventh century, many &s;laves were enfranchi&s;|ed, the greater part of which &s;ettled in cities.

The cities began in the thirteenth century to form leagues for their mutual defence, and for repre&s;&s;ing the di&s;orders occa&s;ioned by the private wars among the barons, as well as by their exactions.

there. It appears, however, from Mariana, vol. ii. p. 221, fol. Hagae 1736, that in the year 1350, eigh|teen cities had obtained a &s;eat in the Cortes of Ca&s;tile. From the account which &s;hall be given of their con&s;ti|tution and preten&s;ions, Sect. III. of this volume, it is evident that their privileges and form of government were the &s;ame with tho&s;e of the other feudal corpora|tions; and this, aswell as the pefect &s;imilarity of political in&s;titutions and tran&s;actions in all the feudal kingdoms, may lead us to conclude, that communities were in|troduced there in the &s;ame manner, and probably about the &s;ame time, as in the other nations of Europe. In Aragon, as I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve in a &s;ub|&s;equent note, cities &s;eem early to have acquired exten|&s;ive immunities, together with a &s;hare in the legi&s;la|ture. In the year 1118, the citizens of Sarago&s;&s;a had not only attained political liberty, but they were de|clared to be of equal rank with the nobles of the &s;econd cla&s;s; and many other immunities, unknown to per|&s;ons in their rank of life in other parts of Europe, were conferred upon them. Zurita Anales de Aragon, tom. i. p. 44. In England, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of communi|ties or corporations was po&s;terior to the Conque&s;t. The practice was borrowed from France, and the privileges granted by the crown were perfectly &s;imilar to tho&s;e which I have enumerated. But as this part of hi&s;tory is well known to mo&s;t of my readers, I &s;hall, without entering into any critical or minute di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, refer them to authors who have fully illu&s;trated this intere&s;ting point in the Engli&s;h hi&s;tory. Brady's Treati&s;e of Bo|roughs. Madox Firma Burgi, chap. i. &s;ect. ix. Hume's Hi&s;tory of England, vol. i. append. i. and ii. It is not improbable that &s;ome of the towns in England were formed into corporations, under the Saxon Kings, and that the charters granted by the Kings of the Nor|man race were not charters of enfranchi&s;ement from a &s;tate of &s;lavery, but a confirmation of privileges which they already enjoyed. See Lord Lyttleton's Hi&s;tory of Henry II. vol. ii. p. 317. The Engli&s;h cities, how|ever, were very incon&s;iderable in the twelfth century. A clear proof of this occurs in the hi&s;tory to which I la&s;t referred. Fitz&s;tephen, a contemporary author,

gives a de&s;cription of the city of London in the reign of Henry II. and the terms in which he &s;peaks of its trade, its wealth, and the &s;plendour of its inhabitants, would &s;ugge&s;t no inadequate idea of its &s;tate at pre&s;ent, when it is the greate&s;t and mo&s;t opulent city of Europe. But all ideas of grandeur and magnificence are merely comparative. It appears from a contemporary author, Peter of Blois, archdeacon of London, who had good opportunity of being informed, that this city, of which Fitz&s;tephen gives &s;uch a pompous account, contained no more than forty thou&s;and inhabitants. Ibid. 315, 316. The other cities were &s;mall in proportion, and in no condition to extort any exten&s;ive privileges.

<P>SOON after the introduction of the third e&s;tate into the national council, the &s;pirit of liberty which that excited in France began to produce con&s;picuous effects. in &s;everal provinces of France, the nobility and com|munities formed a&s;&s;ociations, whereby they bound them&s;elves to defend their rights and privileges again&s;t the formidable and arbitrary proceedings of the King. The count de Boulainvilliers has pre&s;erved a copy of one of the&s;e a&s;&s;ociations, dated in the year 1314, twelve years after the admi&s;&s;ion of the deputies from towns into the States General. Hi&s;toire de L'ancien gouvernement de la France, tom. ii. p. 94. The vigour with which the people a&s;&s;erted and prepared to maintain their rights, obliged their &s;overeigns to re|&s;pect them. Six years after this a&s;&s;ociation, Philip the Long i&s;&s;ued a writ of &s;ummons, to the Communi|ty of Narbonne, in the following terms: "Philip, by the Grace, &amp;c. to our well-beloved, &amp;c. As we de|&s;ire with all our heart, and above all other things, to govern our kingdoms and people in peace and tran|quillity, by the help of God: and to reform our &s;aid kingdom in &s;o far as it &s;tands in need thereof, for the

public good, and for the benefit of our &s;ubjects, who in times pa&s;t have been aggrieved and oppre&s;&s;ed in diver&s;e manners by the malice of &s;undry per&s;ons, as we have learned by common report as well as by the information of good men worthy of credit, and we having determined in our council which we have called to meet in our good city, &amp;c. to give redre&s;s to the utmo&s;t of our power, by all ways and means po&s;&s;ible, according to rea&s;on and ju&s;tice, and willing that this &s;hould be done with &s;olemnity and deliberation by the advice of the prelates, barons, and good towns of our realm, and particularly of you, and that it &s;hould be tran&s;acted agreeable to the will of God, and for the good of our people, therefore we command," &amp;c. Mably, ob&s;ervat. ii. App. p. 386. I &s;hall allow the&s;e to be only the formal words of a public and legal &s;tile, but the ideas are &s;ingular, and much more liberal and enlarged than one could expect in that age. A popular monarch of Great-Bri|tain could hardly addre&s;s him&s;elf to the parliament, in terms more favourable to public liberty. There occurs in the hi&s;tory of France a &s;triking in&s;tance of the progre&s;s which the principles of liberty had made in that kingdom, and of the influence which the de|puties of towns had acquired in the States-General. During the calamities in which the war with England, and the captivity of King John, had involved France, the States-General made abold effort to extend their own privileges and juri&s;diction. The regulations e&s;tabli&s;hed by the States held A. D. 1355, concerning the mode of levying taxes, the admini&s;tration of which they ve&s;ted not in the crown, but in commi&s;&s;ioners appointed by the States; concerning the coining of money; concerning the redre&s;s of the grievance of purveyance; concerning the regular admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice; are much more &s;uitable to the genius of a republican go|vernment than that of a feudal monarchy.

bi&s;hop of Laon, and Marcel Provo&s;t of the merchants of Paris, who had the chief direction of this a&s;&s;embly, as &s;editious tribunes, violent, intere&s;ted, ambitious, and aiming at innovations &s;ubver&s;ive of the con&s;titu|tion and government of their country. That may have been the ca&s;e, but the&s;e men po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the confi|dence of the people; and the mea&s;ures which they propo&s;ed as the mo&s;t popular and acceptable, plainly prove that the &s;pirit of liberty had &s;pread wonderfully, and that the ideas which then prevailed in France con|cerning government were extremely liberal. The States general held at Paris A. D. 1355, con&s;i&s;ted of about eight hundred members, and above one half of the&s;e were deputies from towns. M. Secour&s;&s;e Pref. a Ordon. tom. iii. p. 48. It appears that in all the different a&s;&s;emblies of the States, held during the reign of John, the repre&s;entatives of towns had great influence, and in every re&s;pect the third State was con&s;idered as co-ordinate and equal to either of the other two. Ibid. pa&s;&s;im. The&s;e &s;pirited efforts were made in France long before the Hou&s;e of Commons in England acquired any con&s;iderable influence in the legi&s;lature.

In England, almo&s;t all attempts to e&s;tabli&s;h or to extend the liberty of the people have been &s;ucce&s;sful; in France they have proved unfortu|nate.

<P>IN a former note, No. VIII. I have enquired into the condition of that part of the people who were employed in agriculture, and have repre&s;ented the va|rious hard&s;hips and calamities of their &s;ituation. When charters of liberty and manumi&s;&s;ion were grant|ed to &s;uch per&s;ons, they contained four conce&s;&s;ions corre&s;ponding to the four capital grievances to which men in a &s;tate of &s;ervitude are &s;ubject. 1. The right
<PB N="224" REF="011837_0244_0F9D86752FD80C00">
of di&s;po&s;ing of their per&s;ons by &s;ale or grant was re|linqui&s;hed. 2. Power was given to them of convey|ing their property and effects by will or any other le|gal deed. Or if they happened to die inte&s;tate, it was provided that their property &s;hould go to their lawful heirs in the &s;ame manner as the property of other per|&s;ons. 3. The &s;ervices and taxes which they owed to their &s;uperior or liege Lord, which were formerly ar|bitrary and impo&s;ed at plea&s;ure, are preci&s;ely a&s;cer|tained. 4. They are allowed the privilege of marry|ing whatever per&s;on they cho&s;e, as formerly they could contract no marriage without their Lord's permi&s;&s;ion, and with no per&s;on but one of his &s;laves. All the&s;e particulars are found united in the charter granted Habitatoribus Montis-Britonis. A. D. 1376. Hi&s;t. de Dauphin&egrave;, tom. i. p. 81. Many circum&s;tances concurred with tho&s;e which I have mentioned in the text in procuring them deliverance from that wretch|ed &s;tate. The gentle &s;pirit of the Chri&s;tian religion, to|gether with the doctrines which it teaches, concern|ing the original equality of mankind, as well as the impartial eye with which the Almighty regards men of every condition, and admits them to a participati|on of his benefits, are incon&s;i&s;tent with &s;ervitude. But in this, as in many other in&s;tances, con&s;iderations of intere&s;t, and the maxims of fal&s;e policy led men to a conduct incon&s;i&s;tent with their principles. They were &s;o &s;en&s;ible, however, of the incon&s;i&s;tency, that to &s;et their fellow Chri&s;tians at liberty from &s;ervitude was deemed an act of piety highly meritorious and accept|able to heaven. The humane &s;pirit of the Chri&s;tian religion &s;truggled with the maxims and manners of the world, and contributed more than any other cir|cum&s;tance to introduce the practice of manumi&s;&s;ion. When pope Gregory the Great, who flouri&s;hed to+wards the end of the &s;ixth century, granted liberty to &s;ome of his &s;laves, he gives this rea&s;on for it, "Cum redempter no&s;ter, totius conditor naturae, ad hoc pro|pitiatus humanam carnem voluerit a&s;&s;umere, ut <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ivi|nitaxis &s;uae gratia, dirempto (quo tenebamur captivi) vinculo, pri&s;tinae nos re&s;tituerat libertati; &s;alubriter agitur, &s;i homines, quos ab initio liberos natura pro|tulit,

Several laws or charters founded on rea&s;ons &s;imi|lar to this, are produced by the &s;ame author.

Murat. Antiq. Ital. vol. i. p. 849, 850. Du Cange, voc. <HI>manumi&s;&s;io.</HI> The formality of manumi&s;&s;ion was executed in a church, as a religious &s;olemnity. The per&s;on to be &s;et free was led round the great altar with a torch in his hand, he took hold of the horns of the altar, and there the &s;olemn words conferring li+berty were pronounced.

Many other charters might have been &s;elected, which in point of grammar or &s;tile, are in no wi&s;e &s;uperior to this. Manumi&s;&s;ion was frequently granted on death-bed or by latter will. As the minds of men are at that time awakened to &s;entiments of humanity and piety, the&s;e deeds proceeded from religious motives, and are granted <HI>pro redemptione animae,</HI> in order to obtain acceptance with God. Du Cange ubi &s;upra, p. 470. &amp; voc. <HI>&s;ervus</HI> vol. vi. p. 451. Another method of obtaining liberty was by entering into holy orders, or taking the vow in a mona&s;tery. This was permit|ted for &s;ome time; but &s;o many &s;laves e&s;caped, by this means out of the hands of their ma&s;ters, that the practice was afterwards re&s;trained, and at la&s;t prohi|bited by the laws of almo&s;t all the nations of Europe. Murat. ib. p. 842. Conformably to the &s;ame prin|ciples, Princes, on the birth of a &s;on, or upon any other agreeable event, appointed a certain number of &s;laves to be enfranchi&s;ed, as a te&s;timony of their gra|titude to God for that benefit. Marculfi Form. lib. i. cap. 39. There are &s;everal forms of manumi&s;&s;ion publi&s;hed by Marculfus, and all of them are founded on religious con&s;iderations, in order to procure the favour of God, or to obtain the forgivene&s;s of their &s;ins. Lib. ii. c. 23, 33, 34, edit. Baluz. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation holds with re&s;pect to the other col|lections of Formulae annexed to Marculfus. As &s;en|timents of religion induced &s;ome to grant liberty to their fellow-Chri&s;tians who groaned under the yoke of &s;ervitude; &s;o mi&s;taken ideas concerning devotion led others to relinqui&s;h their liberty. When a per&s;on conceived an extraordinary re&s;pect for the &s;aint who was the patron of any church or mona&s;tery in which he was accu&s;tomed to attend religious wor&s;hip, it was not unu&s;ual among men po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an exce&s;s of &s;uper&s;titious reverence, to give up them&s;elves and their po&s;terity to be &s;laves of the &s;aint. Mabillon. de re Diplomat, lib. vi. 632. The <HI>oblati</HI> or voluntary &s;laves of churches or mona&s;teries were very nume|rous, and may be divided into three different cla&s;&s;es.

The fir&s;t were &s;uch as put them&s;elves and effects un|der the protection of a particular church or mona&s;te|ry, binding them&s;elves to defend its privileges and property again&s;t every aggre&s;&s;or.

They were rather va&s;&s;als than &s;laves, and &s;ometimes per&s;ons of noble birth found it prudent to &s;ecure the protection of the church in this manner. Per|&s;ons of the &s;econd cla&s;s bound them&s;elves to pay an annual <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> or quit-rent out of their e&s;tates to a church or mo|na&s;tery.

How zealous the clergy were to encourge the opini|ons which led to this practice will appear from a clau&s;e in a charter by which one gives up him&s;elf as a &s;lave to a mona&s;tery, "Cum &s;it omni carnali ingenuitate genero&s;ius extremum quodcum&abque; Dei &s;ervitum, &s;ci|licet quod terrena nobilitas multos plerum&abque; vitio|rum &s;ervos facit, &s;ervitus vero Chri&s;ti nobiles virtuti|bus reddit, nemo autem &s;ani capitis virtutibus vitia comparaverit, claret pro certo eum e&s;&s;e genero&s;iorem, qui &s;e Dei &s;ervitio praebu erit proniorem.

<P>THERE is no cu&s;tom in the middle ages more &s;in|gular than that of private war. It is a right of &s;o great importance, and prevailed &s;o univer&s;ally, that the regulations concerning it make a con&s;iderable figure

in the &s;y&s;tem of laws during the middle ages. M. de Monte&s;quieu, who has unravelled &s;o many intricate points in feudal juri&s;prudence, and thrown light on &s;o many cu&s;toms formerly ob&s;cure and unintelligible, was not led by his &s;ubject to con&s;ider this. I &s;hall therefore give a more minute account of the cu&s;toms and regulations which directed a practice &s;o contrary to the pre&s;ent ideas of civilized nations concerning go|vernment and order. 1. Among the ancient Ger|mans, as well as other nations in a &s;imilar &s;tate of &s;o|ciety, the right of avenging injuries was a private and per&s;onal right, exerci&s;ed by force of arms, without any reference to an umpire, or any appeal to a magi|&s;trate for deci&s;ion. The cleare&s;t proofs of this were produced Note VI. 2. This practice &s;ub&s;i&s;ted among the barbarous nations after their &s;ettlement in the provinces of the Empire which they conquered; and as the cau&s;es of di&s;&s;ention among them multiplied, their family feuds and private wars became more frequent. Proo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of this occur in their early hi&s;torians. Greg. Turon. hi&s;t. lib. vii. c. 2. lib. viii. c. 18. lib. x. c. 27. and likewi&s;e in the codes of their laws. It was not only allowable for the relations to avenge the in|juries of their family, but it was incumbent on them. Thus by the laws of the Angli and Werini, ad quem|cunque hereditas terrae pervenerit, ad illum ve&s;tis bellica id e&s;t lorica &amp; ultio proximi, &amp; &s;olatio leudis, debet pertinere. tit. vi. &sect; 5. ap. Lindenbr. Leg. Sa|lic. tit. 63. Legi Longob. lib. ii. tit. 14 &sect; 10.&mdash;3. None but gentlemen, or per&s;ons of noble birth, had the right of private war. All di&s;putes among &s;laves, vil|lani, the inhabitants of towns, and freemen of infe|rior condition, were decided in the courts of ju&s;tice. All di&s;putes between gentlemen and per&s;ons of inferi|or rank were terminated in the &s;ame manner. The right of private war &s;uppo&s;ed nobility of birth, and equality of rank in the contending parties. Beauma|noir Cou&s;tumes de Beauv. ch. lix. p. 300. Ordon. des Rois de France, tom. ii. 395. &sect; xvii. 508. &sect; xv. &amp;c. The dignified eccle&s;ia&s;ticks likewi&s;e claimed and exerci&s;ed the right of private war; but as it was not altogether decent for them to pro&s;ecute quarrels

Du Cange voc. <HI>advocatus.</HI> On many occa&s;ions, the martial ideas to which eccle|&s;ia&s;ticks of noble birth were accu&s;tomed, made them forget the pacifick &s;pirit of their profe&s;&s;ion, and led them into the field in per&s;on at the head of their va&s;&s;als, "flamma, ferro, caede, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;iones eccle&s;iarum praelati defendebant." Guido Abbas ap. Du Cange. Ib. p. 179.&mdash;4. It was not every injury or tre&s;pa&s;s that gave a gentleman a title to make war upon his adver|&s;ary. Atrocious acts of violence, in&s;ults and affronts publickly committed, were legal and permitted mo|tives for taking arms again&s;t the authors of them. Such crimes as are now puni&s;hed capitally in civilized nations, at that time ju&s;tified private ho&s;tilities. Beau|man. ch. lix. Du Cange Di&s;&s;ert. xxix. &s;ur Joinville, p. 331. But though the avenging of injuries was the only motive that could legally authorize a private war, yet di&s;putes concerning civil property, often gave ri&s;e to ho&s;tilities, and were terminated by the &s;word. Du Cange Di&s;&s;ert. p. 332.&mdash;5. All per&s;ons pre&s;ent when any quarrel aro&s;e, or any act of vio|lence was committed, were included in the war which it occa&s;ioned, for it was &s;uppo&s;ed to be impo&s;&s;ible for any man in &s;uch a &s;ituation, to remain neutral, with|out taking &s;ide with one or other of the contend|ing parties. Beauman. p. 300.&mdash;6. All the kin|dred of the two principals in the war were included in it, and obliged to e&s;pou&s;e the quarrel of the chieftain with whom they were connected. Du Cange, ib. 332. This was founded on the maxim of the ancient Germans, "&s;u&s;cipere tam inimicitias &s;eu patris, &s;eu propinqui, quam amicitias, nece&s;&s;e e&s;t;" a maxim natural to all rude and &s;imple nations, among which the form of &s;ociety, and political union &s;trengthens &s;uch a &s;entiment.

degree of affinity which obliged a per&s;on to take part in the quarrel of a kin&s;man was curious. While the church prohibited the marriage of per&s;ons within the &s;eventh degree of affinity, the vengeance of private war extended as far as this ab&s;urd prohibition, and all wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;uch a remote connection with any of the principals were involved in the calamities of war. But when the church relaxed &s;omewhat of its rigour, and did not extend its prohibition of marrying beyond the fourth degree of affinity, the &s;ame re&s;triction took place in the conduct of private war. Beauman. 303. Du Cange Di&s;&s;ert. 333.&mdash;7. A private war could not be carried on between two full brothers, becau&s;e both have the &s;ame common kindred, and con&s;equent|ly neither have any per&s;ons bound to &s;tand by him again&s;t the other, in the conte&s;t; but two brothers of the half blood might wage war, becau&s;e each of them has a di&s;tinct kindred. Beauman. p. 299&mdash;8. The va&s;&s;als of each principal in any private war were in|volved in the conte&s;t, becau&s;e by the feudal maxims they were bound to take arms in defence of their chieftain of whom they held, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in every quarrel. As &s;oon, therefore, as the feudal te|nures were introduced, and this artificial connection was e&s;tabli&s;hed between va&s;&s;als and the baron of whom they held, va&s;&s;als came to be con&s;idered as in the &s;ame &s;tate with relations. Beauman. 303&mdash;9. Private wars were very frequent for &s;everal centuries. Nothing contributed more to increa&s;e tho&s;e di&s;orders in government, and that ferocity of manners which reduced the nations of Europe to that wretched &s;tate which di&s;tingui&s;hed the period of hi&s;tory which I am reviewing. Nothing was &s;uch an ob&s;tacle to the intro|duction of a regular admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice.

The contemporary hi&s;torians de&s;cribe the exce&s;&s;es committed in pro&s;ecution of the&s;e quarrels, in &s;uch terms, as excite a&s;toni&s;hment and horror. I &s;hall mention only one pa&s;&s;age from the hi&s;tory of the Holywar, by Guibert, Abbot of Nogent: "Erat eo tempore maximis ad invice<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ho&s;tilitatibus, totius Francorum regni facta turbatio; cebra ubi&abque; latrocinia, viarum ob&s;e&s;&s;io: andiebantur pa&s;&s;im, im|mo fiebant incendia infinita; nullis praeter &s;ola &amp; in|domita cupiditate exi&s;tentibus cau&s;is extruebantur praelia; &amp; ut brevi totum claudam quicquid obtuti|bus cupidorum &s;ubjacebat, nu&s;qua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> attendendo cu|jus e&s;&s;et, praedae patebat.

<P>HAVING thus collected the chief regulations which cu&s;tom had e&s;tabli&s;hed concerning the right and exer|ci&s;e of private war, I &s;hall enumerate in chronological order the various expedients employed to aboli&s;h or re&s;train this fatal cu&s;tom. 1. The fir&s;t expedient em|ployed by the civil magi&s;trate in order to &s;et &s;ome bounds to the violence of private revenge, was the fix|ing by law the fine or compo&s;ition to be paid for each different crime. The injured per&s;on was originally the &s;ole judge concerning the nature of the wrong which he had &s;uffered, the degree of vengeance which he &s;hould exact, as well as the &s;pecies of attonement or reparation with which he &s;hould re&s;t &s;atisfied. Re|&s;entment became of cour&s;e as implacable as it was fierce. It was often a point of honour not to forgive, nor to be reconciled. This made it nece&s;&s;ary to fix tho&s;e compo&s;itions which make &s;o great a figure in the laws of barbarous nations. The nature of crimes and offences was e&s;timated by the magi&s;trate, and the &s;um due to the per&s;on offended was a&s;certained with a minute, and often a whim&s;ical accuracy. Rotharis, the legi&s;lator of the Lombards, who reigned about the middle of the &s;eventh century, di&s;covers his intention both in a&s;certaining the compo&s;ition to be paid by the offender, and in increa&s;ing its value; it is, &s;ays he, that the enmity may be extingui&s;hed, the pro&s;ecution

may cea&s;e, and peace may be re&s;tored. Leg. Langob. lib. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> tit. 7. &sect; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">. About the beginning of the ninth century, Charlemagne &s;truck at the root of the evil, and enacted, "That when any per&s;on had been guilty of a crime, or had committed an outrage, he &s;hould immediately &s;ubmit to the penance which the church impo&s;ed, and offer to pay the compo&s;ition which the law pre&s;cribed; and if the injured per&s;on or his kindred &s;hould refu&s;e to accept of this, and pre|&s;ume to avenge them&s;elves by force of arms, their lands and properties &s;hould be forfeited. Capitul. A. D. 802. edit. Baluz. vol. i. 371&mdash;3. But in this, as well as in other regulations, the genius of Charle|magne advanced before the &s;pirit of his age. The ideas of his contemporaries concerning regular government were too imperfect, and their manners too fierce to &s;ubmit to this law. Private wars, with all the cala|mities whcih they occa&s;ioned, became more frequent than ever after the death of that great monarch. His &s;ucce&s;&s;ors were unable to re&s;train them. The church found it nece&s;&s;ary to interpo&s;e. The mo&s;t early of the&s;e interpo&s;itions now extant, is towards the end of the tenth century. In the year 990, &s;everal Bi&s;hops in the &s;outh of France a&s;&s;embled, and publi&s;hed vari|ous regulations, in order to &s;et &s;ome bounds to the violence and frequency of private wars; if any per&s;on within their dioce&s;&s;es &s;hould venture to tran&s;gre&s;s, they ordained that he &s;hould be excluded from all Chri&s;tian privileges during his life, and be denied Chri&s;tian bu|rial after his death, Du Mont Corps Diplomatique, tom. i. p. 41. The&s;e, however, were only partial remedies; and therefore a council was held at Limo|ges, A. D. 994. The bodies of the &s;aints, accord|ing to the cu&s;tom of tho&s;e ages, were carried thither; and by the&s;e &s;acred relicks men were exhorted to lay down their arms, to extingui&s;h their animo&s;ities, and to &s;wear that they would not for the future violate the public peace by their private ho&s;tilites. Bouquet Recueil des Hi&s;tor. vol. x. p. 49, 147. Several other councils i&s;&s;ued decrees to the &s;ame effect. Du Cange Di&s;&s;ert. 343&mdash;4. But the authority of coun|cils, how venerable &s;oever in tho&s;e ages, was not &s;uf|ficient

to aboli&s;h a cu&s;tom which flattered the pride of the nobles, and gratified their favourite pa&s;&s;ions. The evil grew &s;o intolerable, that it became nece&s;&s;ary to employ &s;upernatural means for &s;urpre&s;&s;ing it. A bi&s;hop of Aquitaine, A. D. 1032, pretended that an angel had appeared to him, and brought him a writ|ing from heaven, enjoining men to cea&s;e from their ho&s;tilities, and to be reconciled to each other. It was during a &s;ea&s;on of public calamity that he publi&s;hed this revelation. The minds of men were di&s;po&s;ed to receive &s;uch pious impre&s;&s;ions; and willing to perform any thing in order to avert the wrath of heaven. A general peace and ce&s;&s;ation from ho&s;tilities took place, and continued for &s;even years; and a re&s;olution was formed that no man &s;hould in times to come attack or mole&s;t his adver&s;aries during the &s;ea&s;ons &s;et apart for celebrating the great fe&s;tivals of the church, or from the evening of Thur&s;day in each week to the morning of Monday in the week en&s;uing, the inter|vening days being con&s;idered as particularly holy, our Lord's pa&s;&s;ion having happened on one of the&s;e days, and his re&s;urrection on another. A change in the di&s;po&s;ition of men &s;o &s;udden, and which produced a re&s;olution &s;o unexpected, was con&s;idered as miracu|lous; and the re&s;pite from ho&s;tilities which followed upon it, was called <HI>The Truce of God.</HI> Glaber.

if this truce of God had been exactly ob&s;erved, it mu&s;t have gone far towards putting an end to private wars. This, however, &s;eems not to have been the ca&s;e; the nobles, di&s;regarding the truce, pro&s;ecuted their quar|rels without interruption as formerly.

The complaints of this were frequent; and bi&s;hops in order to compel them to renew their vows and pro|mi&s;es of cea&s;ing from their private wars, were obliged to enjoin their clergy to &s;u&s;pend the performance of di|vine &s;ervice, and the exerci&s;e of any religious function within the pari&s;hes of &s;uch as were refractory and ob|&s;tinate. Hi&s;t. de Langued. par. D. D. de Vic &amp; Vai&s;ette, tom. ii. Preuves, p. 118&mdash;5. The people, eager to obtain relief from their &s;ufferings, called in a &s;econd time a pretended revelation to their aid. Towards the end of the twelfth century, a carpenter in Guienne gave out that Je&s;us Chri&s;t together with the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin had appeared to him, and having commanded him to exhort mankind to peace, had given him, as a proof of his mi&s;&s;ion, an image of the Virgin holding her &s;on in her arms, with this in&s;crip|tion, <HI>Lamb of God, who take&s;t away the &s;ins of the world, give us peace.</HI> This low fanatic addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to an ignorant age, prone to credit what was marvellous. He was received as an in&s;pired me&s;&s;enger of God. Ma|ny prelates and barons a&s;&s;embled at Puy, and took an oath, not only to make peace with all their own ene|mies, but to attack &s;uch as refu&s;ed to lay down their arms, and to be reconciled to their enemies.

di&s;&s;olution of government. Philip Augu&s;tus, as &s;ome imagine, or St Louis as is more probable, publi&s;hed an ordonance, A.

This was called <HI>the Royal Truce,</HI> and afforded time for the violence of re&s;entment to &s;ub&s;ide, as well as lei&s;ure for the good offices of &s;uch as were willing to compo&s;e the difference. The happy effects of this re|gulation &s;eem to have been con&s;iderable, if we may judge from the &s;olicitude of &s;ucceeding monarchs to enforce it.&mdash;7. In order to re&s;train the exerci&s;e of pri|vate war &s;till farther, Philip the Fair, towards the clo&s;e of the &s;ame century, A. D. 1296, publi&s;hed an ordonance commanding all private ho&s;tilities to cea&s;e, whil&s;t he was engaged in war again&s;t the enemies of the &s;tate. Ordon. tom. i. p. 328, 390. This regu|lation, which &s;eems to be almo&s;t e&s;&s;ential to the exi&s;t|ence and pre&s;ervation of &s;ociety, was often renewed by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and being enforced by the regal au|thority, proved a con&s;iderable check to the de&s;truc|tive conte&s;ts of the nobles. Both the&s;e regulations, introduced fir&s;t in France, were adopted by the other nations in Europe.&mdash;8. The evil, however, was &s;o inveterate, that it did not yield to all the&s;e remedies. No &s;ooner was public peace e&s;tabli&s;hed in any king|dom, than the barons renewed their private ho&s;tilities. They not only &s;truggled to maintain this pernicious right, but to &s;ecure the exerci&s;e of it without any re|&s;traint. Upon the death of Philip the Fair, the no|bles of different provinces in France formed a&s;&s;ociati|ons, and pre&s;ented remon&s;trances to his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, de|manding the repeal of &s;everal laws, by which he had abridged the privileges of their order. Among the&s;e, the right of private war is always mentioned as one of the mo&s;t valuable; and they claim, that the re&s;traint impo&s;ed by the truce of God, the royal truce, as

The ordonances to which I here refer, are of &s;uch length that I cannot in&s;ert them, but they are extremely curious, and may be peculiarly in&s;truc|tive to an Engli&s;h reader, as they throw con&s;iderable light on that period of Engli&s;h hi&s;tory in which the attempts to circum&s;cribe the regal prerogative were carried on, not by the people &s;truggling for liberty, but by the nobles contending for power. It is not nece&s;&s;ary to produce any evidence of the continu|ance and frequency of private wars under the &s;ucce&s;|&s;ors of Philip the Fair.&mdash;9. A practice &s;omewhat &s;imi|lar to the royal truce was introduced, in order to &s;trengthen and extend it. Bonds of a&s;&s;urance on mu|tual &s;ecurity, were demanded from the parties at va|riance, by which they obliged them&s;elves to ab&s;tain from all ho&s;tilities, either during a time mentioned in the bond, or for ever: and became &s;ubject to hea|vy penalties, if they violated this obligation. The&s;e bonds were &s;ometimes granted voluntarily, but more frequently exacted by the authority of the civil magi&s;|trate. Upon a petition from the party who felt him|&s;elf weake&s;t, the magi&s;trate &s;ummoned his adver&s;ary to appear in court, and obliged him to give a bond of a&s;&s;urance. If, after that, he committed any farther ho&s;tilities, he became &s;ubject to all the penalties of trea&s;on. This re&s;traint on private war was known in the age of St. Louis. E&s;tabli&s;&s;emens, liv. i. c. 28. It was frequent in Bretagne, and what is very re|markable, &s;uch bonds of a&s;&s;urance were given mutu|ally between va&s;&s;als and the lord of whom they held.

on the privileges of their order. Ordon. tom. i. p. 558. This mode of &s;ecurity was fir&s;t in|troduced in cities, and the good effects of it having been felt there, was extended to the nobles. See Note XVI&mdash;10. The calamities occa&s;ioned by private wars, became at &s;ome times &s;o intolerable, that the nobles entered into voluntary a&s;&s;ociations; binding them&s;elves to refer all matters in di&s;pute, whether concerning ci|vil property, or points of honour, to the determina|tion of the majority of the a&s;&s;ociates. Morice Mem. pour &s;ervir de preuves &agrave; l'hi&s;t. de Bret. tom. ii. p. 728&mdash;11. But all the&s;e expedients proving ineffectu|al, Charles VI. A. D. 1413, i&s;&s;ued an ordonance ex|pre&s;ly prohibiting private wars on any pretext what|&s;oever, with power to the judge ordinary to compel all per&s;ons to comply with this injunction, and to puni&s;h &s;uch as &s;hould prove refractory or di&s;obedient, by impri&s;oning their per&s;ons, &s;eizing their goods, and appointing the officers of ju&s;tice, <HI>Mangeurs &amp; Ga&s;teurs,</HI> to live at free quarters on their e&s;tate. If tho&s;e who were di&s;obedient to this edict could not be per&s;onally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re&s;ted, he appointed their friends and va&s;&s;als to be &s;eized, and detained until they gave &s;urety for keep|ing the peace; and he aboli&s;hed all laws, cu&s;toms, or privileges which might be pleaded in oppo&s;ition to this ordonance. Ordon. tom. x. p. 138. How &s;low is the progre&s;s of rea&s;on and of civil order!

Such a change in their own manners, and &s;uch a variation from tho&s;e of their neighbours is remarkable. Is it to be a&s;cribed to the extraordinary power which Willi|am the Norman acquired by right of conque&s;t, and tran&s;mitted to his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, which rendered the ex|ecution of ju&s;tice more vigorous and deci&s;ive, and the juri&s;diction of the King's court more exten&s;ive than under the monarchs on the continent? Or, was it ow|ing to the &s;ettlement of the Normans in England, who having never adopted the practice of private war in their own country, aboli&s;hed it in the kingdom which they conquered? It is a&s;&s;erted in an Ordonance of John King of France, that in all times pa&s;t, per&s;ons of every rank in Normandy have been probibited to wage war, and the practice has been deemed unlawful. Or|don. tom. ii. p. 407. If this fact were certain, it would

go far towards explaining the peculiarity which I have mentioned. But as there are &s;ome Engli&s;h Acts of Parliament, which, according to the remark of the learned author of the <HI>Ob&s;ervations on the Statutes, chief|ly the more ancient,</HI> which recite fal&s;hoods, it may be added, that this is not peculiar to the laws of that country. Notwith&s;tanding the po&s;itive a&s;&s;ertion con|tained in this public law of France, there is good rea&s;on for con&s;idering it as a &s;tatute which recites a fal&s;hood. This, however, is not the place for di&s;cu&s;&s;ing that point. It is an inquiry not unworthy the curio&s;ity of an Engli&s;h antiquarian.</P>
<P>IN Ca&s;tile, the pernicious practice of private war prevailed, and was authori&s;ed by the cu&s;toms and law of the kingdom. Leges Tauri. tit. 76. cum commen|tario Anton. Gomezii, p. 551. As the Ca&s;tilian no|bles were no le&s;s turbulent than powerful, their quar|rels and ho&s;tilities involved their country in many ca|lamities. Innumerable proofs of this occur in Maria|na.

<P>IN Germany, the di&s;orders and calamities occa&s;ion|ed by the right of private war, were greater and more intolerable than in any other country of Europe. The Imperial authority was &s;o much &s;haken and enfeebled by the violence of the civil wars, excited by the conte&s;ts between the Popes and the Emperors of the Franco|nian and Suabian lines, that not only the nobility but the cities acquired almo&s;t independant power, and &s;corned all &s;ubordination and obedience to the laws. The frequency of the&s;e <HI>faidae</HI> or private wars, are of|ten mentioned in the German annals, and the fatal effects of them are mo&s;t pathetically de&s;cribed, Datt. de pace Imper. pub. lib. i. cap. v. n^o. 30. &amp; pa&s;&s;im. The Germans early adopted the Treuga Dei, which was fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed in France. This, however, prov|ed but a temporary and ineffectual remedy. The di&s;or|ders multiplied &s;o fa&s;t, and grew &s;o enormous, that they threatned the di&s;&s;olution of &s;ociety, and compel|led the Germans to have recour&s;e to the only remedy of the evil. viz. an ab&s;olute prohibition of private wars. The Emperor William publi&s;hed his edict to this purpo&s;e, A. D. 1255, an hundred and &s;ixty years previous to the ordonance of Charles VI. in France. Datt. lib. i. cap. 4. n^o. 20. But neither honor his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors had authority to &s;ecure th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ob&s;ervance of it. This gave ri&s;e to a practice in Germany, which con|veys to us a &s;triking idea both of the in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lerable cala|mities occa&s;ioned by private wars, and of the feeble|ne&s;s of government during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The cities and nobles entered into allian|ces and a&s;&s;ociations, by which they bound them&s;elves to maintain the public peace, and to make war on &s;uch as &s;hould violate it. This was the origin of the league of the Rhine, of Suabia, and of many &s;maller confederacies di&s;tingui&s;hed by various names. The ri&s;e and beneficial effects of the&s;e a&s;&s;ociations are trac|ed by Datt with great accuracy. Whatever degree of

public peace or of regular admini&s;tration, was pre&s;erv|ed in the Empire from the beginning of the twelfth century to the clo&s;e of the fifteenth, Germany owes to the&s;e leagues. During that period, political order, re&s;pect for the laws, together with the equal admi|ni&s;tration of ju&s;tice made con&s;iderable progre&s;s in Ger|many. But the final and perpetual abolition of the right of private war was not accompli&s;hed until A. D. 1495. The Imperial authority was by that time more firmly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, the ideas of men with re&s;pect to government and &s;ubordination were become more ju&s;t. That barbarous and pernicious privilege which the nobles had &s;o long po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, was declared to be incompatible with the happine&s;s and exi&s;tence of &s;ociety. In order to terminate any dif|ferences which might ari&s;e among the various num|bers of the Germanick body, the Imperial chamber was in&s;tituted with &s;upreme juri&s;diction, to judge without appeal in every que&s;tion brought before it. That court has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted &s;ince that period, forming a very re&s;pectable tribunal, of e&s;&s;ential importance in the German con&s;titution. Datt, lib. iii. iv. v.

<P>IT would be tedious and of little u&s;e to enumerate the various modes of appealing to the ju&s;tice of God, which &s;uper&s;tition introduced during the ages of ignorance, I &s;hall mention only one, becau&s;e we have an account of it in a placitum or trial in the pre&s;ence of Charlemagne, from which we may learn the imperfect manner in which ju&s;tice was admini&s;|tered even during his reign. In the year 775, a con|te&s;t aro&s;e between the bi&s;hop of Paris and the abbot of St. Denys, concerning the property of a &s;mall abbey.

and altered his po&s;ture, lo&s;t the cau&s;e. The per&s;on employed by the bi&s;hop on this occa&s;ion, had &s;trength or le&s;s &s;pirit than his adver&s;ary, and the que&s;tion was decided in favour of the abbot. Mabillon de re Dip|lomat. lib. vi. p. 498. If a Prince &s;o enlightened as Charlemagne countenanced &s;uch an ab&s;urd mode of deci&s;ion, it is no wonder that other monarchs &s;hould tolerate it &s;o long. M. de Monte&s;quieu has treated of the trial by judicial combat at con&s;iderable length. The two talents which di&s;tingui&s;h that illu&s;trious author, indu&s;try in tracing all the circum&s;taces of ancient and ob&s;cure in&s;titutions, and &s;agacity in penetrating into the cau&s;es and principles which contributed to e&s;tabli&s;h them, are equally con&s;picuous in his ob&s;ervations on this &s;ubject. To the&s;e I refer the reader, as they con|tain mo&s;t of the principles by which I have endeavour|ed to explain this practice. De l'E&s;prit des Loix, lib. xxviii. It &s;eems to be probable from the remarks of M. de Monte&s;quieu, as well as from the facts produc|ed by Muratori, tom. iii. Di&s;&s;ert. xxxviii. that the appeals to the ju&s;tice of God by the experiments with fire and water, &amp;c. were practi&s;ed by the people who &s;ettled in the different provinces of the Roman Empire, before they had recour&s;e to the judicial combat. The judicial combat, however, was the mo&s;t ancient mode of terminating any controver&s;y among the barbarous nations in their original &s;ettlements. This is evident from Velleius Paterculus, lib. ii. c. 118. who in|forms us, that all Que&s;tions which were decided among the Romans by legal trial, were terminated among the Germans by arms. The &s;ame thing ap|pears in the ancient laws and cu&s;toms of the Swedes, quoted by Jo. O. Stiernh&ouml;&ouml;k de Jure Sueonum &amp; Go|thorum vetu&s;to. 4to. Holmiae, 1682. lib. i. c. 7. It is probable, that when the various tribes which invaded the Empire were converted to Chri&s;tianity, the repug|nance of the cu&s;tom of allowing judicial combats to the precepts of religion, was &s;o glaring, that, for &s;ome time, it was aboli&s;hed, and by degrees, &s;everal cir|cum&s;tances which I have mentioned, led them to re|&s;ume it.</P>
<P>It &s;eems likewi&s;e to be probable from a law quoted
<PB N="244" REF="011837_0264_0F9D8685AF7B8098">
by Stiernh&ouml;&ouml;k in the treati&s;e which I have mentioned, that the judicial combat was originally permitted, in order to determine points re&s;pecting the per&s;onal cha|racter or reputation of individuals, and was afterwards extended not only to criminal ca&s;es, but to que&s;tions concerning property. The words of the law are, "if any man &s;hall &s;ay to another the&s;e reproachful words. "you are not a man equal to other men," or, "you have not the heart of a man," and the other &s;hall re|ply, "I am a man as good as you." Let them meet on the highway.

If the per&s;on offended appear, and he who gave offence be ab&s;ent, let him call upon the other thrice with a loud voice, and make a mark upon the earth, and then let him who ab&s;ented him&s;elf, be deemed infamous, becau&s;e he uttered words which he dur&s;t not &s;upport. If both &s;hall appear properly arm|ed, and the per&s;on offended &s;hall fall in the combat, let a half compen&s;ation be paid for his death.

<P>AS M. de Monte&s;quieu's view of this &s;ubject did not lead him to con&s;ider every circum&s;tance relative to ju|dicial combats, I &s;hall mention &s;ome particular facts nece&s;&s;ary for the illu&s;tration of what I have &s;aid with re&s;pect to them. A remarkable in&s;tance occurs of the deci&s;ion of an ab&s;tract point of law by combat. A que&s;|tion aro&s;e in the tenth century concerning the <HI>right</HI> of <HI>repre&s;entation,</HI> which was not then fixed, though now univer&s;ally e&s;tabli&s;hed in every part of Europe. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> It was a matter of doubt and di&s;pute (&s;aith the hi&s;torian) whether the &s;ons of a &s;on ought to be reckoned among the children of the family, and &s;ucceed equally with their uncles, if their father happened to die while their grandfather was alive. An a&s;&s;embly was called to de|liberate on this point, and it was the general opinion, that it ought to be remitted to the examination and deci&s;ion of judges. But the Emperor following a bet|ter cour&s;e, and de&s;irous of dealing honourably with his people and nobles, appointed the matter to be de|cided by battle between two champions. He who ap|peared in behalf of the right of children to repre&s;ent their decea&s;ed father, was victorious; and it was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by a perpetual decree, that they &s;hould here|after &s;hare in the inheritance together with their un|cles. Wittickindus Corbeins, lib. Annal. ap. M. de Lauriere Pref. Ordon. vol. i. p. xxxiii. If we can &s;uppo&s;e the caprice of folly to lead men to any action more extravagant than this, of &s;ettling a point in law by combat, it mu&s;t be that of referring the truth or fal&s;hood of a religious opinion, to be decided in the &s;ame manner, To the di&s;grace of human rea&s;on, it has been capable even of this extravagance. A que&s;tion was agitated in Spain in the eleventh century, whe|ther the Mu&s;arabic Liturgy and ritual which had been u&s;ed in the churches of Spain, or that approved of by

See of Rome, which differed in many particulars from the other, contained the form of wor&s;hip mo&s;t accept|able to the Deity. The Spaniards contended zealou&s;ly for the ritual of their ance&s;tors. The Popes urged them to receive that to which they had given their in|fallible &s;anction. A violent conte&s;t aro&s;e. The no|bles propo&s;ed to decide the controver&s;y by the &s;word. The King approved of this method of deci&s;ion. Two knights in compleat armour entered the li&s;ts. John Ruys de Matanca, the champion of the Mu&s;arabic Li|turgy, was victorious. But the Queen and Archbi|&s;hop of Toledo, who favoured the other form, in&s;i&s;t|ed on having the matter &s;ubmitted to another trial, and had intere&s;t enough to prevail in a reque&s;t, incon|&s;i&s;tent with the laws of combat, which being con&s;ider|ed as an appeal to God, the deci&s;ion ought to have been acquie&s;ced in as final. A great fire was kindled. A copy of each Liturgy was ca&s;t into the flames. It was agreed that the book which &s;tood this proof, and remained untouched, &s;hould be received in all the churches of Spain. The Mu&s;arabic Liturgy triumph|ed likewi&s;e in this trial, and if we may believe Rode|rigo de Toledo, remained unhurt by the fire, when the other was reduced to a&s;hes. The Queen and Archbi&s;hop had power or art &s;ufficient to elude this deci&s;ion al&s;o, and the u&s;e of the Mu&s;arabic form of devotion was permitted only in certain churches. A determination no le&s;s extraordinary than the whole tran&s;action. Rodr. de Toledo, quoted by P. Orleans, Hi&s;t. de Revol. d'E&s;pagne, tom. i. p. 217. Mariana, lib. i. c. 18. vol. i. p. 378.&mdash;A remarkable proof of the general u&s;e of trial by combat, and of the prae|dilection for that mode of deci&s;ion occurs in the laws of the Lombards. It was a cu&s;tom in the middle ages, that any per&s;on might chu&s;e the law to which he would be &s;ubjected; and by the pre&s;criptions of that law he was obliged to regulate his tran&s;ac|tions, without being bound to comply with any prac|tice authorized by other codes of law. Per&s;ons who had &s;ubjected them&s;elves to the Roman law, and ad|hered to the ancient juri&s;prudence, as far as any knowledge of it was retained in tho&s;e ages of igno|rance,

were exempted from paying any regard to the forms of proceedings e&s;tabli&s;hed by the laws of the Burgundians, Lombards, and other barbarous people. But the Emperor Otho, in direct contradic|tion to this received maxim, ordained, "That all per|&s;ons, under whatever law they lived, even although it were the Roman law, &s;hould be bound to conform to the edicts concerning the trial by combat."

While the judicial com|bat &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, proof by charters, contracts, or other deeds, became ineffectual; and even this &s;pecies of evi|dence, calculated to render the proceedings of courts certain and deci&s;ive, was eluded. When a charter or other in&s;trument was produced by one of the parties, his opponent might challenge it, affirm that it was fal&s;e and forged, and offer to prove this by combat. Leg. Longob. ib. &sect; 34. It is true, that among the rea&s;ons enumerated by Beaumanoir, on account of which judges might refu&s;e to permit a trial by combat, one is, "If the point in conte&s;t can be clearly proved or a&s;certained by other evidence." Cou&s;t. de Beauv. ch. 63. p. 323. But that regulation removed the evil only a &s;ingle &s;tep. For the party who &s;u&s;pected that a witne&s;s was about to depo&s;e in a manner unfavour|able to his cau&s;e, might accu&s;e him of being &s;uborned, give him the lie, and challenge him to combat; if the witne&s;s was vanqui&s;hed in battle, no other evi|dence was admitted, and the party by whom he was &s;ummoned to appear lo&s;t his cau&s;e. Leg. Baivar. tit. 16. &sect; 2. Leg. Burgund. tit. 45. Beauman. ch. 61. p. 315. The rea&s;on given for obliging a witne&s;s to accept of a defiance, and to defend him&s;elf by combat, is remarkable, and contains the &s;ame idea which is &s;till the foundation of what is called the point of honour; "for it is ju&s;t, that if any one affirms that he per|fectly knows the truth of any thing, and offers to give oath upon it, that he &s;hould not he&s;itate to main|tain the veracity of his affirmation in combat." Leg. Burgund. tit. 45.</P>
<P>THAT the trial by judicial combat was e&s;tabli&s;hed in every country of Europe, is a fact well known, and requires no proof. That this mode of deci&s;ion was
<PB N="248" REF="011837_0268_0F9D8689925ECA10">
frequent, appears not only from the codes of ancient laws which e&s;tabli&s;hed it, but from the earlie&s;t writers concerning the practice of law in the different nations of Europe. They treat of this cu&s;tom at great length; they enumerate the regulations concerning it with minute accuracy; and explain them with much &s;oli|citude. It made a capital and exten&s;ive article in ju|ri&s;prudence. There is not any one &s;ubject in their &s;y&s;tem of law which Beaumanoir, Defontaines, or the compilers of the a&s;&s;i&s;es de Jeru&s;alem &s;eem to have con|&s;idered as of greater importance; and none on which they have be&s;towed &s;o much attention. The &s;ame ob|&s;ervation will hold with re&s;pect to the early authors of other nations. It appears from Madox, that trials of this kind were &s;o frequent in England, that fines, paid on the&s;e occa&s;ions, made no incon&s;iderable branch of the King's revenue. Hi&s;t. of the Excheq. vol. i. p. 349. A very curious account of a judicial combat between Me&s;ire Robert de Beaumanoir, and Me&s;ire Pierre Tournemine, in pre&s;ence of the duke of Bre|tagne, A. D. 1385, is publi&s;hed by Maurice Mem. pour &s;ervir de preuves &agrave; l'hi&s;t. de Bretagne, tom. ii. p. 498. All the formalities ob&s;erved in &s;uch extraor|dinary proceedings are there de&s;cribed more minutely, than in any ancient monument which I have had an opportunity of con&s;idering. Tournemine was accu&s;|ed by Beaumanoir of having murdered his brother. The former was vanqui&s;hed, but was &s;aved from be|ing hanged upon the &s;pot, by the generous interce&s;&s;i|on of his antagoni&s;t. A good account of the origin of the laws concerning judicial combat, is publi&s;hed in the hi&s;tory of Pavia, by Bernado Sacci, lib. ix. c. 8. in Graev. The&s;. Antiquit. Ital. vol. iii. 743.</P>
<P>THIS mode of trial was &s;o acceptable, that eccle&s;i|a&s;ticks, notwith&s;tanding the prohibitions of the church, were con&s;trained not only to connive at the practice, but to authorize it. A remarkable in&s;tance of this is produced by Pa&s;quier Recherches, lib. iv. ch. i. p. 350. The abbot Wittikindus, who&s;e words I have produced in this note, con&s;idered the determination of a point in law by combat, as the be&s;t and mo&s;t ho|nourable mode of deci&s;ion. In the year 978, a judi|cial
<PB N="249" REF="011837_0269_0F9D8689AC9CBEF0">
combat was fought in the pre&s;ence of the Emperor Henry. The archbi&s;hop Aldebert advi&s;ed him to ter|minate a conte&s;t which had ari&s;en between two noble|men of his court, by this mode of deci&s;ion. The vanqui&s;hed combatant, though a per&s;on of high rank, was beheaded on the &s;pot. Chronic. Ditmari Epi&s;c. Mer&s;b. chez Bouquet Recueil des Hi&s;t. tom. x. p. 121. Que&s;tions concerning the property of churches and mona&s;teries, were decided by combat. In the year 961, a controver&s;y concerning the church of St. Me|dard, whether it belonged to the abbey of Beaulieu, was terminated by judicial combat. Bouquet Recueil des Hi&s;t. tom. ix. p. 729. Ibid. p. 612, &amp;c. The Em|peror Henry I. declares, that his law authori&s;ing the practice of judicial combats, was enacted with con|&s;ent and applau&s;e of many faithful bi&s;hops. Ibid p. 231. So remarkably did the martial ideas of tho&s;e ages prevail over the genius and maxims of the canon law, which in other in&s;tances had &s;uch credit and authority with eccle&s;ia&s;ticks. A judicial combat was appointed in Spain, by Charles V. A. D. 1522. The combatants fought in the Emperor's pre&s;ence, and the battle was conducted with all the rites pre&s;cribed by the ancient laws of chivalry. The whole tran&s;ac|tion is de&s;cribed at great length by Pontus Heuterus Rer. Au&s;triac. lib. viii. c. 17. p. 205.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t in&s;tance which occurs in the hi&s;tory of France, of a judicial combat authori&s;ed by the ma|gi&s;trate, was the famous one between M. Jarnac and M. de la Chai&s;taignerie, A. D. 1547. A trial by com|bat was appointed in England, A. D. 1571. under the in&s;pection of the judges in the court of common pleas; and though it was not carried to the &s;ame extremity with the former, Queen Elizabeth having interpo&s;ed her authority, and enjoined the parties to compound the matter, yet in order to pre&s;erve their honour, the li&s;ts were marked out, and all the forms previous to the combat were ob&s;erved with much ceremony. Spelm. Glo&s;&s;. voc. <HI>Campus,</HI> p. 103. In the year 1631. a judicial combat was appointed between Do|nald Lord Rea, and David Ram&s;ay, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> by the autho|rity of the Lord high Con&s;table, and Earl Mar&s;hal of

<HEAD>NOTE XXIII. [Z]. SECT. I.</HEAD>
<P>THE text contains the great outlines which mark the cour&s;e of private and public juri&s;diction in the &s;everal nations of Europe. I &s;hall here follow more minutely the various &s;teps of this progre&s;s, as the mat|ter is curious and important enough to merit this at|tention. The payment of a fine by way of &s;atisfac|tion to the per&s;on or family injured, was the fir&s;t device of a rude people, in order to check the career of private re&s;entment, and to extingui&s;h tho&s;e <HI>faidae,</HI> or deadly feuds which were pro&s;ecuted among them with the utmo&s;t violence. This cu&s;tom may be traced back to the ancient Germans. Tacit. de Morib. Ger. c. 21. and prevailed among other uncivilized nations. Many examples of this are collected by the ingenious and learned author of Hi&s;torical Law-Tracts, vol. i. p. 41. The&s;e fines were a&s;certained and levied in three different manners. At fir&s;t they were &s;ettled by vo|luntary agreement between the parties at variance. When their rage began to &s;ub&s;ide, and they felt the bad effects of their continuing in enmity, they came to terms of concord, and the &s;atisfaction made was called a <HI>compo&s;ition,</HI> implying that it was fixed by mu|tual con&s;ent. De l'E&s;prit des Loix, lib. xxx. c. 19. It is apparent from &s;ome of the more ancient codes of laws, that when the&s;e were compiled matters &s;till remained in that &s;imple &s;tate. In certain ca&s;es, the per&s;on who had committed an offence was left ex|po&s;ed to the re&s;entment of tho&s;e whom he had injured, until he &s;hould recover their favour, quoquo modo potuerit. Lex Fri&s;ion. tit. 11. &sect; 1. The next mode of levying the&s;e fines was by the &s;entence of arbiters. An arbiter is called in the Regiam maje&s;tatem amica|bilis compo&s;itor. lib. 11. c. 4. &sect; 10. He could e&s;timate the degree of offence with more impartiality than the parties intere&s;ted, and determine with greater equity
<PB N="251" REF="011837_0271_0F9D868AEFDAC738">
what &s;atisfaction ought to be demanded. It is diffi|cult to bring an authentic proof of a cu&s;tom previous to the records pre&s;erved in any nation of Europe. But one of the Formulae Andegaven&s;es compiled in the &s;ixth century, &s;eems to allude to a tran&s;action car|ried on not by the authority of a judge, but by the mediation of arbiters. Bouquet Recueil des Hi&s;tor. tom. iv. p. 566. But as an arbiter wanted authority to enforce his deci&s;ions, judges were appointed with compul&s;ive power to oblige both parties to acquie&s;ce in their deci&s;ions. Previous to this la&s;t &s;tep, the ex|pedient of paying compo&s;itions was an imperfect re|medy again&s;t the pernicious effects of private re&s;ent|ment. As &s;oon as this important change was intro|duced, the magi&s;trate, putting him&s;elf in place of the per&s;on injured, a&s;certained the compo&s;ition with which he ought to re&s;t &s;atisfied. Every po&s;&s;ible injury that could occur in the cour&s;e of human &s;ociety, was con&s;idered and e&s;timated, and the compo&s;itions due to the per&s;on aggrieved were fixed with &s;uch minute attention as di&s;covers, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, amazing di&s;cern|ment and delicacy, in &s;ome in&s;tances, unaccountable caprice. Be&s;ides the compo&s;ition payable to the pri|vate party, a certain &s;um, called a <HI>fredum,</HI> was paid to the King or &s;tate, as Tacitus expre&s;&s;es it, or to the fi&s;cus, in the language of the barbarous laws. Some authors, blending the refined ideas of modern policy with their rea&s;onings concerning ancient tran&s;actions, have imagined that the fredum was a compen&s;ation due to the community, on account of the violation of the publick peace. But it is manife&s;tly the price paid to the magi&s;trate for the protection which he af|forded again&s;t the violence of re&s;entment. The en|acting of this was a con&s;iderable &s;tep towards improve|ment in criminal juri&s;prudence. In &s;ome of the more ancient codes of laws, the <HI>freda</HI> are altogether omit|ted, or &s;o &s;eldom mentioned, that it is evident they were but little known. In the latter codes the fre|dum is as preci&s;ely &s;pecified as the compo&s;ition. In common ca&s;es it was equal to the third part of the compo&s;ition. Capitul. vol. i. p. 52. In &s;ome ex|traordinary ca&s;es, where it was more difficult to
<PB N="252" REF="011837_0272_0F9D868BB02921D0">
protect the per&s;on who had committed violence, the fredum was augmented. Capitul. vol. i. p. 515. The&s;e freda made a con&s;iderable branch in the revenues of the barons; and wherever territorial juri&s;diction was granted, the royal judges were prohibited from levy|ing any freda. In explaining the nature of the fre|dum, I have followed, in a great mea&s;ure, the opinion of M. de Monte&s;quieu, though I know that &s;everal learned antiquarians have taken the word in a different &s;en&s;e. De l'E&s;prit des Loix, lib. xxx. c. 20, &amp;c. The great object of judges was to compel the one party to give, and the other to accept the &s;atisfaction pre&s;cribed. They multiplied regulations to this pur|po&s;e, and enforced them by grievous penalties. Leg. Longob. lib. i. tit. 9. &sect; 34. Ib. tit. 37. &sect; 1, 2. Capitul. vol. i. p. 371. &sect; 22. The per&s;on who received a com|po&s;ition was obliged to cea&s;e from all farther ho&s;tility, and to confirm his reconciliation with the adver&s;e par|ty by an oath. Leg. Longob. lib. i. tit. 9. &sect; 8. As an additional and more permanent evidence of reconcili|ation, he was required to grant a bond of &s;ecurity to the per&s;on from whom he received a compo&s;ition, ab|&s;olving him from all farther pro&s;ecution. Marculfus and the other collectors of ancient writs have pre&s;erv|ed &s;everal different forms of &s;uch bonds. Marc. lib. 11. &sect; 18. append. &sect; 23. Form. Sirmandicae, &sect; 39. The <HI>Letters of Slanes,</HI> known in the law of Scotland, are perfectly &s;imilar to the&s;e bonds of &s;ecurity. By the letters of Slanes, the heirs and relations of a per&s;on who had been murdered, bound them&s;elves, in con&s;i|deration of an <HI>A&s;&s;ythment</HI> or compo&s;ition paid to them, to forgive, pa&s;s over, and forever forget, and in ob|livion inter all rancour, malice, revenge, prejudice, grudge and re&s;entment, that they have or may con|ceive again&s;t the aggre&s;&s;or or his po&s;terity, for the crime which he had committed, and di&s;charge him of all action, civil or criminal, again&s;t him or his e&s;tate, for now and ever. Sy&s;tem of Stiles by Dallas of St. Martin's, p. 862. In the ancient form of letters of Slanes, the private party not only forgives and for|gets, but pardons and grants remi&s;&s;ion of the crime. This practice, Dallas, rea&s;oning according to the prin|ciples

of his own age, con&s;iders as an encroachment on the rights of &s;overeignty, as none, &s;ays he, could pardon a criminal but the king. Ibid. But in early and rude times, the puni&s;hment, and the pardon of criminals, were all deeds of the private per&s;on who was injured. Madox has publi&s;hed two writs, one in the reign of Edward I. the other in the reign of Ed|ward III. by which private per&s;ons grant a relea&s;e or pardon of all tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, felonies, robberies, and mur|ders committed. Formul. Anglican. No. 702, 705. In the la&s;t of the&s;e in&s;truments, &s;ome regard &s;eems to be paid to the rights of the &s;overeign, for the pardon is granted <HI>en quant que en nous e&s;t.</HI> Even after the au|thority of the magi&s;trate is interpo&s;ed in puni&s;hing criminals, the puni&s;hment of criminals is long con&s;i|dered chiefly as a gratification to the re&s;entment of the per&s;ons who have been injured. In Per&s;ia a murderer is &s;till delivered to the relations of the per&s;on whom he has &s;lain, who put him to death with their own hands. If they refu&s;e to accept of a &s;um of money as a compen&s;ation, the &s;overeign, ab&s;olute as he is, cannot pardon the murderer. Tavernier's voyages, book v. c. 5 and 10. By a law in the kingdom of Ara|gon as late as the year 1564, the puni&s;hment of one condemned to death cannot be mitigated but by con|&s;ent of the parties who have been injured. Fueros &amp; Ob&s;ervancias del Reyno de Aragon, p. 204, 6.</P>
<P>IF, after all the engagements to cea&s;e from enmi|ty, which I have mentioned, any per&s;on renewed ho&s;|tilities, and was guilty of any violence, either towards the per&s;on from whom he had received a compo&s;iti|on, or towards his relations and heirs, this was deemed a mo&s;t heinous crime, and puni&s;hed with ex|traordinary rigour. It was an act of direct rebellion again&s;t the authority of the magi&s;trate, and was re|pre&s;&s;ed by the interpo&s;ition of all his power. Leg. Longob. lib. i. tit. 9. &sect; 8, 34. Capit. vol. i. p. 371. &sect; 22. Thus the avenging of injuries was taken out of private hands, a legal compo&s;ition was e&s;tabli&s;hed, and peace and amity were re&s;tored under the in&s;pec|tion, and by the authority of a judge. It is evident, that at the time when the barbarians &s;ettled in the pro|vinces
<PB N="254" REF="011837_0274_0F9D868D30B33960">
of the Roman Empire, they had fixed judges e&s;tabli&s;hed among them with compul&s;ive authority. Per&s;ons ve&s;ted with this character are mentioned by the earlie&s;t hi&s;torians. Du Cange, voc. <HI>Judices.</HI> The right of territorial juri&s;diction was not altogether an u&s;urpation of the feudal barons. There is good rea|&s;on to believe that the powerful leaders who &s;eized different di&s;tricts of the countries which they con|quered, and kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them as <HI>allodial</HI> pro|perty, a&s;&s;umed at the &s;ame time the right of juri&s;dic|tion, and exerci&s;ed it within their own territories. This juri&s;diction was &s;upreme, and extended to all cau&s;es. The cleare&s;t proofs of this are produced by M. Bouquet. Le Droit publique de France eclairci, &amp;c. tom. i. p. 206, &amp;c. The privilege of judging his own va&s;&s;als, appears to have been originally a right inherent in every baron who held a fief. As far back as the archives of nations can conduct us with any certainty, we find the juri&s;diction and fief unit|ed. One of the earlie&s;t charters to a layman which I have met with, is that of Ludovicus Pius, A. D. 814. And it contains the right of territorial juri&s;|diction, in the mo&s;t expre&s;s and exten&s;ive terms. Capitul. vol. ii. p. 1405. There are many charters to churches and mona&s;teries of more early date, containing grants of &s;imilar juri&s;diction, and prohi|biting any royal judge to enter the territories of tho&s;e churches or mona&s;teries, or to perform any act of judicial authority there. Bouquet. Recuel. des Hi&s;t. tom. iv. p. 628, 631, 633. tom. v. p. 703, 710, 752, 762. Muratori has publi&s;hed many very an|cient charters containing the &s;ame immunities. An|tiq. Ital. Di&s;&s;ert. lxx. In mo&s;t of the&s;e deeds, the exacting of <HI>Freda</HI> is particularly prohibited, which &s;hews that they con&s;tituted a valuable part of the publick revenue at that juncture. The expence of obtaining a &s;entence in a court of ju&s;tice during the middle ages was &s;o con&s;iderable, that this circum|&s;tance alone was &s;ufficient to render men unwilling to decide any conte&s;t in judicial form. It appears from a charter in the thirteenth century, that the baron who had the right of ju&s;tice, received the
<PB N="255" REF="011837_0275_0F9D868DF0954950">
fifth part of the value of every &s;ubject, the property of which was tried and determined in his court. If, after the commencement of a law &s;uit, the parties terminated the conte&s;t in an amicable manner, or by arbitration, they were neverthele&s;s bound to pay the fifth part of the &s;ubject conte&s;ted to the court before which the &s;uit had been brought. Hi&s;t. de Dauphi|n&egrave;. Geneve, 1722, tom. i. p. 22. Similar to this is a regulation in the charter of liberty granted to the town of Friburg, A. D. 1120. If two of the citizens &s;hall quarrel, and if one of them &s;hall complain to the &s;uperior Lord, or to his judge, and after com|mencing the &s;uit &s;hall be privately reconciled to his adver&s;ary; the judge, if he does not approve of this reconciliation, may compel him to in&s;i&s;t in his law|&s;uit; and all who were pre&s;ent at the reconciliation &s;hall forfeit the favour of the &s;uperior Lord. Hi&s;toria Zaringo Baden&s;is. Auctor. Jo. Dan. Schoepflinus. Carol&s;r. 1765. 4to. vol. v. p. 55.</P>
<P>WHAT was the extent of that juri&s;diction which tho&s;e who held fiefs po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed originally, we cannot now determine with certainty. It is evident that during the di&s;orders which prevailed in every king|dom of Europe, the great va&s;&s;als took advantage of the feeblene&s;s of their Monarchs, and enlarged their juri&s;dictions to the utmo&s;t. As early as the tenth century, the more powerful barons had u&s;urped the right of deciding all cau&s;es, whether civil or crimi|nal. They had acquired the <HI>High Ju&s;tice</HI> as well as the <HI>Low.</HI> E&s;tabl. de St. Louis, lib. i. c. 24, 25. Their &s;entences were final, and there lay no appeal from them to any &s;uperior court. Several &s;triking in|&s;tances of this are collected by Bru&s;&s;el. Trait&eacute; des Fiefs, liv. iii. c. 11, 12, 13. Not &s;atisfied with this, the more potent barons got their territories erected into <HI>Regalities,</HI> with almo&s;t every royal prerogative and juri&s;diction. In&s;tances of the&s;e were frequent in France. Bru&s;&s;. ib. In Scotland, where the power of the feudal nobles became exorbitant, they were very numerous. Hi&s;torical Law Tracts, vol. i. tract. vi. Even in England, though the authority of the Norman Kings circum&s;cribed the juri&s;diction of the
<PB N="256" REF="011837_0276_0F9D868EB1333ED0">
barons more than in any feudal kindom, &s;everal counties palatine were erected, into which the king's judges could not enter, and no writ could come in the King's name, until it received the &s;eal of the county palatine. Spelman. Glo&s;&s;. voc. <HI>Commites Pala|tini;</HI> Black&s;tone's Commentaries on the Laws of Eng|land, vol. iii. p. 78. The&s;e lords of regalities had a right to claim or re&s;cue their va&s;&s;als from the King's judges, if they a&s;&s;umed any juri&s;diction over them. Bru&s;&s;el ubi &s;upra. In the law of Scotland this pri|vilege was termed the right of <HI>repledging;</HI> and the frequency of it not only interrupted the cour&s;e of ju&s;|tice, but gave ri&s;e to great di&s;orders in the exerci&s;e of it. Hi&s;t. Law Tracts, ib. The juri&s;diction of the counties palatine was productive of like inconvenien|cies in England.</P>
<P>THE remedies provided by Princes again&s;t the bad effects of the&s;e u&s;urpations were various, and gradu|ally applied. Under Charlemagne and his immediate de&s;cendants, the regal prerogative &s;till retained great vigour, and the <HI>Duces, Comites,</HI> and <HI>Mi&s;&s;i Dominici,</HI> the former of whom were ordinary and fixed judges, the latter extraordinary and itinerant judges, in the different provinces of their exten&s;ive dominions, ex|erci&s;ed a juri&s;diction co-ordinate with the barons in &s;ome ca&s;es, and &s;uperior to them in others. Du Cange voc. <HI>Dux. Comites</HI> &amp; <HI>Mi&s;&s;i.</HI> Murat. Antiq. Di&s;|&s;ert. viii. &amp; ix. But under the feeble race of Mo|narchs who &s;ucceeded them, the authority of the royal judges declined, and the barons u&s;urped that unlimited juri&s;diction which has been de&s;cribed. Louis VI. of France attempted to revive the function of the <HI>Mi&s;&s;i Dominici</HI> under the title of <HI>Juges des Ex|empts,</HI> but the barons were become too powerful to bear &s;uch an encroachment on their juri&s;diction, and he was obliged to de&s;i&s;t from employing them. He|naut. A breg&eacute; Chron. tom. ii. p. 730. His &s;ucce&s;&s;|ors (as has been ob&s;erved) had recour&s;e to expedients le&s;s alarming. The appeal <HI>de defaute de Droit,</HI> or on account of the refu&s;al of ju&s;tice, was the fir&s;t which was attended with any con&s;iderable effect. Ac|cording to the maxims of feudal law, if a baron had

De l'E&s;prit des Loix, liv. xxviii. c. 28. Du Cange voc. <HI>defectus Ju&s;titiae.</HI> The number of Peers or a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors in the courts of Barons was frequently very con&s;iderable. It appears from a criminal trial in the court of the vi&s;count de Lautrec, A. D. 1299, that upwards of two hundred per&s;ons were pre&s;ent, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the trial, and voted in pa&s;&s;ing judg|ment. Hi&s;t. de Langued. par D. D. De Vic. &amp; Vai|&s;ette, tom, iv. Preuves, p. 114. As the right of ju|ri&s;diction had been u&s;urped by many incon&s;iderable barons, they were often unable to hold courts. This gave frequent occa&s;ion to &s;uch appeals, and rendered the practice familiar. By degrees, &s;uch appeals be|gan to be taken from the courts of the more power|ful barons, and it is evident, from a deci&s;ion record|ed by Bru&s;&s;el, that the royal judges were willing to give countenance to any pretext for them. Trait&eacute; des Fiefs, tom. i. p. 235, 261. This &s;pecies of ap|peal had le&s;s effect in abridging the juri&s;diction of the nobles, than the appeal on account of the inju&s;tice of the &s;entence.

Nothing however, was of &s;uch effect as the attention which monarchs gave to the con&s;titution and dignity of their courts of ju&s;tice. It was the ancient cu&s;tom for the feudal monarchs to pre&s;ide them&s;elves in their courts, and to admini|&s;ter ju&s;tice in per&s;on. Marculf. lib. i. &sect; 25. Murat, Di&s;&s;ert. xxxi.

St. Louis, who encouraged to the utmo&s;t the prac|tice of appeals, revived this ancient cu&s;tom, and ad|mini&s;tred ju&s;tice in per&s;on with all the ancient &s;impli|city.

They took advantage of e|very defect in the rights of the barons, and of every error in their proceedings, to remove cau&s;es out of their courts, and to bring them under their own cog|nizance. There was a di&s;tinction in the feudal law, and an extremely ancient one, between the high ju&s;|tice and the low. Capitul. 3. A. D. 812. &sect; 4. A. D. 815. &sect; 3.

Paris, and the other parliaments which admini&s;tred ju&s;tice in the King's name, in different provinces of the kingdom. This juri&s;diction, however, the par|liament of Paris acquired very &s;lowly, and the great va&s;&s;als of the crown made violent efforts in order to ob&s;truct the attempts of this parliament to extend its authority. Towards the clo&s;e of the thirteenth cen|tury, Philip the fair was obliged to prohibit his par|liament from taking cogni&s;ance of certain appeals brought into it from the courts of the Count of Bre|tagne, and to recognize his right of &s;upreme and fi|nal juri&s;diction.

So violent was the oppo&s;ition of the ba|rons to this right of appeal which they con&s;idered as fatal to their privileges and power, that the authors of the <HI>Encyclopedie</HI> have mentioned &s;everal in&s;tances in which barons put to death, or mutilated, or con|fi&s;cated the goods of &s;uch as ventured to appeal from the &s;entences pronounced in their courts, to the par|liament of Paris, tom. xii.

<P>THE progre&s;s of juri&s;diction in the other feudal kingdoms was in a great mea&s;ure &s;imilar to that which we have traced in France. In England, the territorial juri&s;diction of the barons was both ancient and exten&s;ive. Leg. Edw. Conf. N^o 5 and 9. Af|ter the Norman conque&s;t it became more &s;trictly feu|dal; and it is evident from facts recorded in the En|gli&s;h hi&s;tory, as well as from the in&s;titution of coun|ties Palatine, which I have already mentioned, that the u&s;urpations of the nobles in England were not in|ferior to tho&s;e of their contemporaries on the conti|nent. The &s;ame expedients were employed to cir|cum&s;cribe or aboli&s;h tho&s;e dangerous juri&s;dictions. William the Conqueror e&s;tabli&s;hed a con&s;tant court in the hall of his palace; from which the four courts now entru&s;ted with the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice in England took their ri&s;e.

Ju&s;tices of peace were appointed in every county by &s;ub&s;equent monarchs; to who&s;e juri&s;dic|tion the people gradually had recour&s;e in many civil cau&s;es. The privileges of the Counties Palatine were gradually limited; with re&s;pect to &s;ome points they were aboli&s;hed; and the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice was brought into the King's courts, or before judges of his appointment.

<P>IT is not ea&s;y to fix with preci&s;ion the period, at which Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks fir&s;t began to claim exemption from the civil juri&s;diction. It is certain, that during the early and pure&s;t ages of the church, they pre|tended to no &s;uch immunity. The authority of the civil magi&s;trates extended to all per&s;ons, and to all cau&s;es. This fact has not only been clearly e&s;tabli&s;h|ed by Prote&s;tant authors, but is admitted by many Roman Catholicks of eminence, and particularly by the writers in defence of the liberties of the Gallican church. There are &s;everal original papers publi&s;hed by Muratori, which &s;hew that in the ninth and tenth centuries, cau&s;es of the greate&s;t importance relating to eccle&s;ia&s;ticks were &s;till determined by civil judges. Antiq. Ital. vol. v. Di&s;&s;ert. lxx. Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks did not &s;hake off all at once their &s;ubjection to civil courts. This privilege, like their other u&s;urpations, was gain|ed &s;lowly, and &s;tep by &s;tep. This exemption &s;eems at fir&s;t to have been merely an act of complai&s;ance, flowing from veneration for their character. Thus from a charter of Charlemagne in favour of the church of Mans, A. D. 796, to which M. l'Abbe de Foy re|fers in his Notice de Diplomes, tom. i. p. 201, that monarch directs his judges, if any difference &s;hould ari&s;e between the admini&s;trators of the revenues of that church and any per&s;on whatever, not to &s;ummon the admini&s;trators to appear in mallo publico; but fir&s;t of all to meet with them, and to endeavour to accommodate the difference in an amicable manner. This indulgence was in proce&s;s of time improved into a legal exemption; which was founded on the &s;ame &s;uper&s;titious re&s;pect of the laity for the clerical charac|ter and function. A remarkable in&s;tance of this oc|curs in a charter of Frederick Barbaro&s;&s;a, A. D. 1172, to the mona&s;tery of Altenburg. He grants them ju|dicium non tantum &s;anguinolentis plagae, &s;ed vitae &amp; mortis; he prohibits any of the royal judges from di&s;turbing their juri&s;diction; and the rea&s;on which he gives for this ample conce&s;&s;ion is, nam quorum ex

<P>IT is not nece&s;&s;ary for illu&s;trating what is contain|ed in the text, that I &s;hould de&s;cribe the manner in which the code of the canon law was compiled, and &s;hew that the doctrines in it mo&s;t favourable to the power of the clergy, are founded on ignorance, or &s;upported by fraud and forgery. The reader will find a full account of the&s;e in Gerard. Van Ma&s;tricht, Hi&s;toria Juris Eccle&s;ia&s;tici, &amp; in Science de Govern|ment par M. Real, tom. vii. c. 1. &amp; 3. &sect; 2, 3, &amp;c. The hi&s;tory of the progre&s;s and extent of eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction, with an account of the arts which the clergy employed, in order to draw cau&s;es of every kind into the &s;piritual courts, is no le&s;s curious, and would throw a great light upon many of the cu&s;toms and in&s;titutions of the dark ages; but it is likewi&s;e foreign from the pre&s;ent &s;ubject. Du Cange in his Glo&s;&s;ary, voc. <HI>Curia Chri&s;tianitatis,</HI> has collected mo&s;t of the cau&s;es with re&s;pect to which the clergy arro|gated an exclu&s;ive juri&s;diction, and refers to the au|thors or original papers, which confirm his ob&s;ervati|ons, Giannon&egrave; in his Civil Hi&s;tory of Naples, lib. xix. &sect; 3. has ranged the&s;e under proper heads, and &s;crutinizes the preten&s;ions of the church with his u&s;ual boldne&s;s and di&s;cernment. M. Fleury ob&s;erves, that the clergy multiplied at &s;uch a rate, the pretexts for extending the authority of the &s;piritual courts, that it was in their power to withdraw every per&s;on and every cau&s;e from the juri&s;diction of the civil magi&s;trate. Hi&s;t. Eccle&s;. tom. xix. Di&s;c. Prelim. 16. But how ill founded &s;oever the juri&s;diction of the clergy may be, or whatever might be the abu&s;es to which their manner of exerci&s;ing it gave ri&s;e, the principles and forms of their juri&s;prudence were far more perfect, than that which was known in the civil courts. It is probable, that eccle&s;ia&s;ticks never &s;ubmitted during any period of the middle ages, to the laws contained in the codes of the barbarous nations, but were go|verned entirely by the Roman law. They regulated
<PB N="264" REF="011837_0284_0F9D869588026A40">
all their tran&s;actions by &s;uch of its maxims as were pre&s;erved by tradition, or were contained in the The|odo&s;ian code, and other books extant among them. This we learn from a cu&s;tom which prevailed univer|&s;ally in tho&s;e ages. Every per&s;on was permitted to chu&s;e among the various codes of laws then in force, that to which he was willing to conform. In any tran&s;action of importance, it was u&s;ual for the per&s;ons contracting to mention the law to which they &s;ubmit|ted, that it might be known how any controver&s;y that &s;hould ari&s;e between them was to be decided. In|numerable proofs of this occur in the charters of the middle ages. But the clergy con&s;idered it as &s;uch a valuable privilege of their order to be governed by the Roman law, that when any per&s;on entered into holy orders, it was u&s;ual for him to renounce the laws to which he had been formerly &s;ubject, and to declare that he now &s;ubmitted to the Roman law.

<P>THE code of the cannon law began to be compiled early in the ninth century. Mem. de l'Acad. des In|&s;cript. tom. xviii. p. 346, &amp;c. It was above two centuries after that before any collection was made of tho&s;e cu&s;toms, which were the rule of judgment in the courts of the barons. Spiritual judges decided, of cour&s;e, according to written and known laws; Lay judges, left without any fixed guide, were directed by loo&s;e traditionary cu&s;toms. But be&s;ides this gene|ral advantage of the canon law, its forms and princi|ples were more con&s;onant to rea&s;on, and more fa|vourable to the equitable deci&s;ion of every point in controver&s;y, than tho&s;e which prevailed in lay courts. It appears from Notes XXI. and XXII. concerning private wars, and the trial by combat, that the whole &s;pirit of eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;prudence was adver&s;e to the&s;e &s;anguinary cu&s;toms which were de&s;tructive of ju&s;tice;
<PB N="265" REF="011837_0285_0F9D86962F458060">
and the whole force of eccle&s;ia&s;tical authority was ex|erted to aboli&s;h them, and to &s;ub&s;titute trials by law and evidence in their room. Almo&s;t all the forms in lay courts which contribute to e&s;tabli&s;h, and continue to pre&s;erve order in judicial proceedings, are borrow|ed from the canon law. Fleury In&s;tit. du droit can|on, part iii. c. 6. p. 52. St. Louis in his E&s;tabli&s;&s;e|mens confirms many of his new regulations concern|ing property, and the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, by the authority of the canon law, from which he borrow|ed them. Thus, for in&s;tance, the fir&s;t hint of attach|ing moveables for the recovery of a debt, was taken from the canon law. E&s;tabl. liv. ii. c. 21 and 40.

The&s;e and many other &s;alutary regulations, the Canoni&s;ts borrowed from the Roman law. Many other examples might be pro|duced of more perfect juri&s;prudence in the canon law than was known in lay courts. For that rea&s;on it was deemed an high privilege to be &s;ubject to eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction. Among the many immunities, by which men were allured to engage in the dangerous expedi|tions for the recovery of the Holy Land, one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable was the declaring tho&s;e who took the Cro&s;s to be &s;ubject only to the &s;piritual courts.

about the year 1150. Gratian publi&s;hed the code of canon law, with large additions and emendations, about the &s;ame time. The earlie&s;t collection of the&s;e cu&s;toms, which &s;erved as the rules of deci&s;ion in the courts of ju&s;tice, is the <HI>A&s;&s;i&s;es de Jeru&s;alem.</HI> They were compiled, as the preamble informs us, in the year 1099, and are called Jus Con&s;uetudinarium quo regebatur regnum orientale.

But there was at that time no collection of cu&s;toms, and no attempt to render law fixed in any country of Europe.

As &s;oon as men became acquainted with the advantages of having written cu&s;toms and laws to which they could have recour&s;e on every occa&s;ion, the method of collecting them became common. Charles VII. of France, by an ordonance, A. D. 1453, appointed the cu&s;tomary laws in every province of France to be collected and arranged. Velly and Villaret. Hi&s;toire tom. xvi. p. 113.

never been fully executed, and the French juri&s;pru|dence remains more ob&s;cure and uncertain than if the&s;e prudent regulations of their monarch had taken ef|fect. A practice was e&s;tabli&s;hed in the middle ages, which affords the cleare&s;t proof that judges while they had no other rule to direct their decrees but un|written and traditionary cu&s;toms, were often at a lo&s;s how to find out the facts and principles, accord|ing to which they were bound to decide. They were obliged in dubious ca&s;es to call a certain number of old men, and to lay the ca&s;e before them, that they might inform them what was the practice or cu&s;tom with regard to the point. This was called <HI>Enque&s;te par tourbe.</HI> Du Cange, voc. <HI>Turba.</HI> The effects of the revival of the Roman juri&s;prudence have been ex|plained by M. de Monte&s;quieu, liv. xxviii. c. 42. and by Mr Hume, Hi&s;t. of England, vol. ii. p. 441. I have adopted many of their ideas. Who can pre|tend to review any &s;ubject which &s;uch writers have con&s;idered, without receiving from them light and information? At the &s;ame time I am convinced that the knowledge of the Roman law was not &s;o entirely lo&s;t in Europe during the middle ages, as is common|ly believed. My &s;ubject does not require me to exa|mine this point. Many &s;triking facts with regard to it are collected by Donato Antonio D'A&s;ti Dal' U&s;o e autorita della ragione civil&egrave; nelle provincie dell' Impe|rio Occidentale. Nap. 1751. 2 vol. 8vo.</P>
<P>THAT the civil law is intimately connected with the municipal juri&s;prudence in &s;everal countries of Eu|rope, is a fact &s;o well known, that it needs no illu&s;tra|tion. Even in England, where the Common law is &s;uppo&s;ed to form a &s;y&s;tem perfectly di&s;tinct from the Roman code, and although tho&s;e who apply in that country to the &s;tudy of the Common law boa&s;t, with affectation, of this di&s;tinction, it is evident that many of the ideas and maxims of the civil law are incorpo|rated into the Engli&s;h juri&s;prudence. This is well il|lu&s;trated by the ingenious and learned author or Ob|&s;ervations on the Statutes, chiefly the more ancient. 2d edit. p. 66.</P>

<P>THE whole hi&s;tory of the middle ages makes it evi|dent that war was the &s;ole profe&s;&s;ion of gentlemen, and the only &s;ubject attended to in their education, Even after &s;ome change in manners began to take place, and the civil arts of life had acquired &s;ome re|putation, the ancient ideas with re&s;pect to the accom|pli&s;hments nece&s;&s;ary for a per&s;on of noble birth, con|tinued long in force. In the Memoires de Fleuran|ges, p. 9. &amp;c. we have an account of the youthful ex|erci&s;es and occupations of Francis I. and they are al|together martial and athletic. That father of letters owed his reli&s;h for them, not to education, but to his own good &s;en&s;e, and good ta&s;te. The manners of the &s;uperior order of eccle&s;ia&s;tics, during the mid|dle ages, furni&s;h the &s;tronge&s;t proof, that the di&s;tinc|tion of profe&s;&s;ions was &s;carce known in Europe. The functions and character of the clergy are obviou&s;ly very different from tho&s;e of laymen; and among the inferior orders of churchmen, this con&s;tituted a di&s;|tinct character, &s;eparate from that of their citizens. But the dignified eccle&s;ia&s;tics, who were frequently of noble birth, were above &s;uch a di&s;tinction; they retained the idea of what belonged to them as gentle|men, and in &s;pite of the decrees of Popes, or the ca|nons of coun&s;els, they bore arms, led their va&s;&s;als to the field, and fought at their head in battle. Among them the prie&s;thood was &s;carce a &s;eparate profe&s;&s;ion; the military accompli&s;hments which they thought e&s;&s;ential to them as gentlemen, were cultivated; the theological &s;cience, and pacific virtues &s;uitable to their &s;piritual function, were neglected and de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as the &s;cience of law became a laborious &s;tudy, and the practice of it a &s;eparate profe&s;&s;ion, &s;uch as ro&s;e, to eminence in it obtained honours formerly appropriated to &s;oldiers. Knighthood was the mo&s;t illu&s;trious mark of di&s;tinction during &s;everal ages, and conferred privileges to which rank or birth alone were not entitled. To this high dignity per&s;ons emi|nent for their knowledge of law were advanced, and

by that were placed on a level with tho&s;e whom their military talents had rendered con&s;picuous. <HI>Miles Ju&s;titiae, Miles Literatus</HI> became common titles. Matthew Paris mentions &s;uch knights as early as A. D. 1251. If a judge attained a certain rank in the courts of ju&s;tice, that alone gave him a right to the honour of knighthood.

<P>THE &s;ubject of my enquiries does not call me to write a hi&s;tory of the progre&s;s of &s;cience. The facts and ob&s;ervations which I have produced are &s;ufficient to illu&s;trate the effects of its progre&s;s upon manners and
<PB N="270" REF="011837_0290_0F9D869CEE71F808">
the &s;tate of of &s;ociety. While &s;cience was altogether extinct in the we&s;tern parts of Europe, it was cultiva|ted in Con&s;tantinople and other parts of the Grecian Empire. But the &s;ubtile genius of the Greeks turned almo&s;t entirely to theological di&s;putation. The La|tins borrowed that &s;pirit from them, and many of the controver&s;ies which &s;till occupy, and divide Theolo|gians, took their ri&s;e among the Greeks, from whom the other Europeans derived a con&s;iderable part of their knowledge. See the te&s;timony of Aeneas Sylvi|us ap Coringium de antiq. academicis, p. 43. Hi&s;to|ire literaire de France, tom. vii. p. 113, &amp;c. tom. ix. p. 151, &amp;c. Soon after the Empire of the Caliphs was e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Ea&s;t, &s;ome illu&s;trious princes aro&s;e among them, who encouraged &s;cience. But when the Arabians turned their attention to the lite|rature cultivated by the ancient Greeks and Romans, the cha&s;te and correct ta&s;te of their works of genius appeared frigid, and unanimated to a people of a more warm imagination. It was impo&s;&s;ible for them to ad|mire the poets and hi&s;torians of Athens, or of Rome. But they were &s;en&s;ible of the merit of their philo&s;o|phers. The operations of the intellect are more fixed and uniform than tho&s;e of the fancy or ta&s;te. Truth makes an impre&s;&s;ion nearly the &s;ame in every place; the ideas of what is beautiful, elegant, or &s;ublime, vary in different climates. The Arabians, though they neglected Homer, tran&s;lated the mo&s;t eminent of the Greek philo&s;ophers into their own language; and, guided by their precepts and di&s;coveries, applied them&s;elves with great ardour to the &s;tudy of geome|try, a&s;tronomy, medicine, dialectics and metaphy&s;ics. In the three former they made con&s;iderable and u&s;eful improvements, which have contributed not a little to advance tho&s;e &s;ciences to that high degree of perfecti|on which they have attained. In the two latter, they choo&s;e Ari&s;totle for their guide, and refining on the &s;ubtle and di&s;tingui&s;hing &s;pirit which characterizes his philo&s;ophy, they rendered it altogether frivolous or unintelligible. The &s;chools e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Ea&s;t for teaching and cultivating the&s;e &s;ciences, were in high reputation. They communicated their love of &s;cience
<PB N="271" REF="011837_0291_0F9D869D0818E810">
to their countrymen, who conquered A&s;ia and Spain; and the &s;chools in&s;tituted there were little inferior in fame to tho&s;e in the Ea&s;t. Many of the per&s;ons who di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by their proficiency in &s;ci|ence in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, were educated among the Arabians. Bruckerus collects many in&s;tances of this. Hi&s;tor. Philo&s;. v. iii. p. 681, &amp;c. Almo&s;t all the men eminent for &s;cience during &s;everal centuries, were in&s;tructed in the &s;ciences by the Arabians. The fir&s;t knowledge of the Ari&s;totelian philo&s;ophy in the middle ages, was acquired by tran&s;|lations of his works out of the Arabick. The Arabi|an commentators were deemed the mo&s;t &s;kilful and authentic guides in the &s;tudy of his &s;y&s;tem. Conring. antiq. acad. Di&s;&s;. iii. p. 95, &amp;c. Supplem. p. 241, &amp;c. Murat. antiquit. Ital. vol. iii. p. 932, &amp;c. From them the &s;choolmen derived the genius and principles of their philo&s;ophy, which contributed &s;o much to re|tard the progre&s;s of true &s;cience.</P>
<P>THE e&s;tabli&s;hment of Colleges or univer&s;ities is a remarkable aera in literary hi&s;tory. The &s;chools in cathedrals and mona&s;teries confined them&s;elves chiefly to the teaching of grammar. There were only one or two ma&s;ters employed in that office. But in colleges, profe&s;&s;ors were appointed to teach all the different parts of &s;cience. The time that ought to be allotted to the &s;tudy of each was a&s;certained. A regular form of trying the proficien|cy of &s;tudents was pre&s;cribed; and academical titles and honours were conferred on &s;uch as acquitted them&s;elves with approbation. A good account of the origin and nature of the&s;e is given by Seb. Bac|mei&s;terus Antiquitates Ro&s;tochien&s;es, &s;ive, Hi&s;toria Urbis &amp; Academiae Ro&s;toch. ap. Monumenta inedita Rer. Germ. per E. J. de We&s;tphalen, vol. iii. p. 781. Lip&s;. 1743. The fir&s;t ob&s;cure mention of the&s;e aca|demical degrees in the Univer&s;ity of Paris, (from which the other univer&s;ities in Europe have borrowed mo&s;t of their cu&s;toms and in&s;titutions) occurs, A.

<PB N="272" REF="011837_0292_0F9D869DDD54AAC0">
privileges to which batchelors, ma&s;ters and doctors were entitled. One circum&s;tance is &s;ufficient to de|mon&s;trate the high degree of e&s;timation in which they were held. Doctors in the different faculties contend|ed with knights for the precedence, and the di&s;pute was terminated in many in&s;tances by advancing the former to the dignity of knighthood, the high prero|gatives of which I have mentioned. It was even a&s;|&s;erted, that a doctor had a right to that title without creation. Bartolus taught&mdash;doctorem actualiter regentem in jure civili per decennium effici militem ip&s;o facto. Honore de St. Marie Di&s;&s;ert. p. 165. This was called Chevalierie de lectures, and the per&s;ons ad|vanced to that dignity, milites Clerici. The&s;e new e&s;tabli&s;hments for education, together with the extra|ordinary honours conferred on learned men, greatly increa&s;ed the number of &s;cholars. In the year 1262, there were ten thou&s;and &s;tudents in the univer&s;ity of Bologna; and it appears from the hi&s;tory of that uni|ver&s;ity, that law was the only &s;cience taught in it at that time. In the year 1340, there were thirty thou|&s;and in the univer&s;ity of Oxford. Speed's Chron. ap. Ander&s;on's Chronol. Deduction of Commerce, vol. i. p. 172. In the &s;ame century, ten thou&s;and per&s;ons voted in a que&s;tion agitated in the univer&s;ity of Paris; and as graduates alone were admitted to that privi|lege, the number of &s;tudents mu&s;t have been va&s;t|ly great. Velly Hi&s;t. de France, tom. xi. p. 147. There were indeed few univer&s;ities in Europe at that time; but &s;uch a number of &s;tudents may neverthele&s;s be produced as a proof of the extraordinary ardour with which men turned to the &s;tudy of &s;cience in tho&s;e ages; it &s;hows likewi&s;e that they already began to con&s;ider other profe&s;&s;ions than that of a &s;oldier as ho|nourable and u&s;eful.</P>

<P>MANY proofs occur in hi&s;tory of the little inter|cour&s;e between nations during the middle ages. To|wards the clo&s;e of the tenth century, Count Bouch|ard intending to found a mona&s;tery at St. Maur des Fo&s;&s;es, near Paris, applied to an Abbot of Clugny in Burgundy, famous for his &s;anctity, intreating him to conduct the monks thither. The language in which he addre&s;&s;ed that holy man is &s;ingular: He tells him that he had undertaken the labour of &s;uch a great journey; that he was fatigued with the length of it, therefore hoped to obtain his reque&s;t, and that his journey into &s;uch a di&s;tant country &s;hould not be in vain. The an&s;wer of the abbot is &s;till more extra|ordinary: He refu&s;ed to comply with his de&s;ire, as it would be extreamly fatiguing to go along with him into a &s;trange and unknown region. Vita Burchar|di venerabiles Comites ap. Bouquet Rec. des Hi&s;t. vol. x. p. 351. Even &s;o late as the beginning of the twelfth century, the monks of Ferrieres in the dio|ce&s;e of Sens did not know that there was &s;uch a city as Tournay in Flanders; and the monks of St. Mar|tin of Tournay, were equally unacquainted with the &s;ituation of Ferrrieres. A tran&s;action in which they were both concerned, made it nece&s;&s;ary for them to have &s;ome intercour&s;e. The mutual intere&s;t of both mona&s;teries prompted each to find out the &s;ituation of the other. After a long &s;earch, which is particu|larly de&s;cribed, the di&s;covery was made by accident. Herimannus Abbas de Re&s;tauratione St. Martini Tor|nacen&s;is ap. Dacher. Spicel. vol. xii. p. 400. The ig|norance of the middle ages with re&s;pect to the &s;ituati|on and geography of remote countries was &s;till more remarkable. The mo&s;t ancient geographical chart which now remains as a monument of the &s;tate of that &s;cience in Europe during the middle ages, is found in a manu&s;cript of the Chronique de St. De|nys. There the three parts of the earth then known
<PB N="274" REF="011837_0294_0F9D869F3B8ACC40">
are &s;o repre&s;ented, that Jeru&s;alem is placed in the middle of the globe, and Alexandria appears to be as near to it as Nazareth. Mem. de l'Acad. des Belles Lettres, tom. xvi. p. 185, There &s;eem to have been no inns or hou&s;es of entertainment for the reception of travellers during the middle ages. Murat. An|tiq. Ital. vol. iii. p. 581, &amp;c. This is a proof of the little intercour&s;e which took place between different nations. Among people who&s;e manners are &s;imple, and who are &s;eldom vi&s;ited by &s;trangers, ho&s;pitali|ty is a virtue of the fir&s;t rank. This duty of ho&s;pitali|ty was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary in that &s;tate of &s;ociety which took place during the middle ages, that it was not con&s;idered as one of tho&s;e virtues which men may practi&s;e or not, according to the temper of their minds, and the genero&s;ity of their hearts. Ho&s;pita|lity was enforced by &s;tatutes, and tho&s;e who neglect|ed this duty were liable to puni&s;hment. Quicumque ho&s;piti venienti lectum, aut focum negaverit, trium &s;elidorum inlatione mulctetur, Leg. Burgund. tit. xxxviii. &sect; 1. Si quis homini aliquo pergenti in iti|nere man&s;ionem vetaverit &s;exaginta &s;olidos componat in publico. Capitul. lib. vi. &sect; 82. This increa&s;e of the penalty, at a period &s;o long after that in which the laws of the Burgundians were publi&s;hed, and when the &s;tate of &s;ociety was much improved, is very re|markable. Other laws of the &s;ame purport are col|lected by Jo. Fred. Polac Sy&s;tema Juri&s;prud. Germa|nicae, Lip&s;. 1733. p. 75. The laws of the Slavi were more rigorous than any that he mentions; they or|dained, "that the moveables of an inho&s;pitable per|&s;on &s;hould be confi&s;cated, and his hou&s;e burnt. They were even &s;o &s;olicitous for the entertainment of &s;tran|gers, that they permitted the landlord to &s;teal for the entertainment of his gue&s;t." Quot noctu furatus fueris, eras appone ho&s;pitibus. Rerum Mecleburgicar. lib. viii. a Mat. Jo. Beehr. Lip&s;. 1751. p. 50. In con|&s;equence of the&s;e laws or of that &s;tate of &s;ociety which made it proper to enact them, ho&s;pitality abounded while the intercour&s;e among men was incon&s;iderable, and &s;ecured the &s;tranger a kind reception under every roof where he cho&s;e to take &s;helter. This two proves clearly, that the intercour&s;e among men was rare
<PB N="27" REF="011837_0295_0F9D869FF08D4688">
for as &s;oon as this increa&s;ed, what was a plea&s;ure be|came a burden, and the entertaining of travellers was converted into a branch of commerce.</P>
<P>BUT the laws of the middle ages afford a proof &s;till more convincing of the &s;mall intercour&s;e between dif|ferent nations. The genius of the Feudal &s;y&s;tem, as well as the &s;pirit of jealou&s;y which always accompanies ignorance, joined in di&s;couraging &s;trangers from &s;et|tling in any country. If a per&s;on removed from one province in a kingdom to another, he was bound with|in a year and a day, to acknowledge him&s;elf the va&s;&s;al of the baron in who&s;e e&s;tate he &s;ettled; if he ne|glected to do &s;o, he became liable to a penalty, and if at his death he neglected to leave a certain legacy to the baron within who&s;e territories he re&s;ided, all his goods were confi&s;cated. The hard&s;hips impo&s;ed on foreigners &s;ettling in a &s;trange country, were &s;till more intolerable. In more early times, the &s;uperior lord of any territory, in which a foreigner &s;ettled, might &s;eize his per&s;on, and reduce him to &s;ervitude. Very &s;triking in&s;tances of this occur in the hi&s;tory of the middle ages. The cruel depredations of the Normans in the ninth century, obliged many inhabitants of the maritime provinces of France, to fly into the interior parts of the kingdom. But in&s;tead of being received with that humanity to which their wretched condition entitled them, they were reduced to a &s;tate of &s;ervi|tude. Both the civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical powers found it nece&s;&s;ary to interpo&s;e, in order to put a &s;top to this barbarous practice. Potgie&s;&s;er. de Statu Servor. lib. i. c. 1. &sect; 16. In other countries, the laws permitted the inhabitants of the maritime provinces, to reduce &s;uch as were &s;hipwrecked on their coa&s;t, to &s;ervitude. Ibid. &sect; 17. This barbarous cu&s;tom prevailed in other coun|tries of Europe. The practice of &s;eizing the goods of per&s;ons who had been &s;hipwrecked, and of confi&s;cating as the property of the lord on who&s;e manor they were thrown, &s;eems to have been univer&s;al.

Cou&s;t. de Beauv. ch. 45. p. 254. But as a practice &s;o contrary to humanity could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t, the &s;uperior lords found it nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;t &s;atisfied with levying certain annual taxes from aliens, by impo&s;ing upon them &s;ome extraordinary duties or &s;ervices. But when any &s;tranger died, he could not convey his effects by a will; and all his real as well as per&s;onal e&s;tate fell to the king, or to the lord of the barony, to the exclu&s;ion of his natural heirs.

This practice of confi&s;cating the effects of &s;trangers up|on their death, was very ancient. It is mentioned, though very ob&s;curely, in a law of Charlemagne, A. D. 813. Capitul.

<P>WITH re&s;pect to the progre&s;s of commerce which I have de&s;cribed, p. 78, &amp;c. it may be ob&s;erved that the Italian &s;tates carried on &s;ome commerce with the cities of the Greek empire, as early as the age of Char|lemagne, and imported into their own country the rich commodities of the ea&s;t. Murat. Antiq. Ital. vol. ii. p, 882. In the tenth century, the Venetians had opened a trade with Alexandria in Egypt. Ibid. The inhabitants of Amalphi and Pi&s;a had likewi&s;e ex|tended their trade to the &s;ame ports. Murat. Ib. p. 884, 885. The effects of the Cru&s;ades in increa&s;ing the wealth and commerce of the Italian &s;tates, and particularly that which they carried on with the Ea&s;t, I have already explained in this volume. They not only imported the Indian commodities from the Ea&s;t, but e&s;tabli&s;hed manufactures of curious fabric in their own country. Several of the&s;e are enumerated by Muratori in his Di&s;&s;ertations concerning the <HI>arts</HI> and the <HI>weaving</HI> of the middle ages. Antiq. Ital. vol. ii. p. 349, 399. They made great progre&s;s particularly in the manufacture of &s;ilk, which had long been pe|culiar to the ea&s;tern provinces of A&s;ia. Silk &s;tuffs were of &s;uch high price in ancient Rome, that only a few per&s;ons of the fir&s;t rank were able to purcha&s;e them. Under Aurelian, A. D. 270, a pound of &s;ilk was equal in value to a pound of gold. Ab&s;it ut auro fila pen&s;entur. Libra enim auri tune libra &s;erici fuit. Vopi&s;cus in Aureliano. Ju&s;tinian, in the &s;ixth centu|ry, introduced the art of rearing &s;ilk-worms into Greece, which rendered the commodity &s;omewhat more plentiful, though &s;till it was of &s;uch great va|lue, as to remain an article of luxury or magnificence, re&s;erved only for per&s;ons of the fir&s;t order, or for pub|lic &s;olemnities. Roger I. King of Sicily, about the year 1130, carried off a number of artificers in the &s;ilk trade from Athens, and &s;ettling them in Palermo, introduced the culture of &s;ilk into his kingdom, from which it was communicated to other parts of Italy.

of the fourteenth century, a thou&s;and citizens of Genoa appeared in one proce&s;&s;ion clad in &s;ilk robes. Sugar is likewi&s;e a production of the Ea&s;t. Some plants of the &s;ugar-cane were brought from A&s;ia; and the fir&s;t attempt to cultivate them in Sicily was made about the middle of the twelfth century. From thence they were tran&s;planted into the &s;outhern provinces of Spain. From Spain they were carried to the Canary and Madeira i&s;les, and at length into the new world. Ludovico Guicciardini, in enumerating the goods im|ported into Antwerp, about the year 1560, mentions the &s;ugar which they received from Spain and Portu|gal as a con&s;iderable article. He de&s;cribes that as the product of the Madeira and Canary i&s;lands. De&s;critt. de Pae&s;i Ba&s;&s;i, p. 180, 181. The &s;ugar-cane was either not introduced into the We&s;t-Indies at that time, or the cultivation of it was not &s;o con&s;iderable as to furni&s;h an article in commerce. In the middle ages, though &s;ugar was not rai&s;ed in &s;uch quantities, or employed for &s;o many purpo&s;es, as to become one of the common nece&s;&s;aries of life, it appears to have been a con&s;iderable article in the commerce of the Italian &s;tates.</P>
<P>THESE various commodities with which the Itali|ans furni&s;hed the other nations of Europe, procured them a favourable reception in every kingdom. They were e&s;tabli&s;hed in France in the thirteenth century with mo&s;t exten&s;ive immunities. They not only ob|tained every indulgence favourable to their commerce, but per&s;onal rights and privileges were granted to them, which the natives of the kingdom did not en|joy. Ordon. tom. iv. p. 688. By a &s;pecial provi&s;o, they were exempted from the droit d'aubaine. Ibid, p. 670. As the Lombards engro&s;&s;ed the trade of every kingdom in which they &s;ettled, they became ma&s;ters of its ca&s;h. Money of cour&s;e was in their hands not only a &s;ign of the value of their commodities, but became an object of commerce it&s;elf. They dealt largely as bankers. In an ordonance, A. D. 1295, we find them &s;tiled <HI>mercatores</HI> and <HI>camp&s;ores.</HI> They car|ried on this as well as other branches of their com|merce with &s;omewhat of that rapacious &s;pirit which is

natural to monopolizers, who are not re&s;trained by the concurrence of rivals. An ab&s;urd opinion, which prevailed in the middle ages, was, however, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the cau&s;e, of their exorbitant demands, and may be pleaded in apology for them. Commerce can|not be carried on with advantage unle&s;s the per&s;ons who lend a &s;um are allowed a certain premium for the u&s;e of their money, and as a compen&s;ation for the ri&s;k which they run in permitting another to traffick with their &s;tock. This premium is fixed by law in all com|mercial countries, and is called the legal intere&s;t of money. But the Fathers of the church prepo&s;terou&s;|ly applied the prohibitions of u&s;ury in &s;cripture to the payment of legal intere&s;t, and condemned it as a &s;in. The &s;choolmen, mi&s;led by Ari&s;totle, who&s;e &s;entiments they followed implicitly, and without examination, adopted the &s;ame error, and enforced it. Black&s;tone's Commentaries on the laws of England, vol. ii. p. 455. Thus the Lombards found them&s;elves engaged in a traffick which was deemed criminal and odious. They were liable to puni&s;hment if detected. They were not &s;atisfied, therefore, with that moderate premium, which they might have claimed, if their trade had been open and authori&s;ed by law. They exacted a &s;um proportional to the danger and infamy of a di&s;co|very. Accordingly, we find th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it was u&s;ual for them to demand twenty per cent. for the u&s;e of mo|ney in the thirteenth century. Murat. Antiq.

app. 1433. As late as the year 1490, it appears that the intere&s;t of money in Placentia, was at the rate of forty per cent. This is the more extraordinary, be|cau&s;e at that time the commerce of the Italian States was become con&s;iderable. Memoire Storiche de Pia|cenza, tom. viii. p. 134. Piac. 1760. It appears from Lud. Guicciardini, that Charles V. had fixed the rate of intere&s;t in his dominions in the Low-Coun|tries at twelve per cent. and at the time when he wrote about the year 1560, it was not uncommon to exact more than that &s;um. He complains of this as exorbitant, and points out its bad effects both on agriculture and commerce. De&s;critt. di Pae&s;i Ba&s;&s;i, p. 172. This high intere&s;t of money, is alone a proof that the profits on commerce were exorbitant.&mdash;The Lombards were likewi&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hed in England, in the thirteenth century, and a con&s;iderable &s;treet in the city of London &s;till bears their name. They en|joyed great privileges, and carried on an exten&s;ive com|merce, particularly as bankers. See Ander&s;on's Chronol. Deduction, vol. i. p. 137, 160, 204, 231, where the &s;tatutes or other authorities, which confirm this are quoted. But the chief mart for Italian com|modities was at Bruges. Navigation was then &s;o im|perfect, that a voyage between the Baltick and Me|diterranean could not be performed in one &s;ummer. For that rea&s;on, a magazine or &s;torehou&s;e half way between the commercial cities in the North, and tho&s;e in Italy became nece&s;&s;ary. Bruges was pitched upon as the mo&s;t convenient &s;tation. That choice intro|duced va&s;t wealth into the Low-Countries. Bruges was at once the &s;taple for Engli&s;h wool; for the wool|len and linnen manufactures of the Netherlands; for the naval &s;tores, and other bulky commodities of the north; and for the Indian commodities, as well as do|me&s;tick productions imported by the Italian States. The extent of its commerce in Indian goods with Ve|nice alone appears from one fact. In the year 1318, five Venetian galea&s;&s;es laden with Indian commodities arrived at Bruges, in order to di&s;po&s;e of their cargoes at the fair. L. Guic. De&s;critt, di Pae&s;i Ba&s;&s;i, p. 174. Galea&s;&s;es were ve&s;&s;els of very con&s;iderable bur|then.

It was the greate&s;t emporium in all Europe. Many proofs of this occur in the hi&s;torians and re|cords of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. But in&s;tead of multiplying quotations, I &s;hall refer my readers to Ander&s;on, vol. i. p. 12, 137, 213, 246, The nature of this work prevents me from entering into any long details, but there are &s;ome detached facts, which give an high idea of the wealth both of the Flemi&s;h and Italian commercial &s;tates. The Duke of Brabant contracted his daughter to the Black Prince, &s;on of Edward III. of England, A. D. 1339, and gave her a portion which would amount to three hundred thou&s;and pounds of our pre&s;ent money. Ry|mer's Faed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, vol. v. p. 113. John Galeazzo Vi&s;|conti Duke of Milan concluded a treaty of marriage between his daughter and Lionel Duke of Clarence Edward's third &s;on. A. D. 1367, and granted a por|tion equal to two hundred thou&s;and pounds of our pre&s;ent money. Rymer Faeder. vol. vi. p. 547. The&s;e exorbitant &s;ums &s;o far exceeding what was then granted by the mo&s;t powerful monarchs, and which appear extraordinary even in the pre&s;ent age, when the wealth of Europe is &s;o much increa&s;ed, mu&s;t have ari&s;en from the riches which flowed into the&s;e coun|tries from their exten&s;ive and lucrative commerce.

Ander&s;on has mentioned the chief facts with re&s;pect to their commercial progre&s;s, the extent of the privileges which they obtained in different countries, their &s;ucce&s;sful wars with &s;everal monarchs, as well as the &s;pirit and zeal with which they contended for tho&s;e liberties and rights, without which it is impo&s;&s;ible to carry on commerce to advan|tage. The vigorous efforts of a &s;ociety attentive only to commercial objects, could not fail of diffu&s;ing over Europe new and more liberal ideas concerning ju&s;tice and order wherever they &s;ettled.</P>
<P>IN England the progre&s;s of commerce was extre|mely &s;low; and the cau&s;es of this are obvious. Dur|ing the Saxon heptarchy, England, &s;plit into many petty kingdoms, which were perpetually at va|riance with each other, expo&s;ed to the fierce incur&s;ions of the Danes, and other northern pirates, and &s;unk in barbarity and ignorance, was in no condition to cultivate commerce, or to pur&s;ue any &s;y&s;tem of u&s;eful and &s;alutary policy. When a better pro&s;pect began to open by the union of the kingdom under one monarch, the Norman conque&s;t took place. This occa&s;ioned &s;uch a violent &s;hock, and &s;uch a &s;udden and total re|volution of property, that the nation did not recover from it during &s;everal reigns. By the time that the con&s;titution began to acquire &s;ome &s;tability, and the Engli&s;h had &s;o incorporated with their conquerors as to become one people, the nation engaged with no le&s;s ardour than imprudence in &s;upport of their monarch's preten&s;ions to the crown of France, and long wa&s;ted its vigour and genius in its wild efforts to conquer that kingdom. When by ill &s;ucce&s;s and repeated di&s;appointments, a period was at la&s;t put to this fatal frenzy, and the nation beginning to enjoy &s;ome re|po&s;e, had lei&s;ure to breathe and to gather new &s;trength, the de&s;tructive wars between the hou&s;es of York and Lanca&s;ter broke out, and involved the kingdom in the wor&s;t of all calamities. Thus, be&s;ides the common ob&s;tructions of commerce occa&s;ioned by the nature of

the feudal government, and the &s;tate of manners dur|ing the middle ages, its progre&s;s in England was re|tarded by peculiar cau&s;es. Such a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of events adver&s;e to the commercial &s;pirit was &s;ufficient to have checked its growth, although every other circum&s;tance had favoured it. The Engli&s;h were accordingly one of the la&s;t nations in Europe who availed them&s;elves of their natural commercial advantages. Before the reign of Edward III. all the wool of England except a a &s;mall quantity wrought into cour&s;e cloths for home con&s;umption, was &s;old to the Flemings or Lombards, and manufactured by them. Though Edward, A. D. 1326, began to allure &s;ome of the Flemi&s;h weavers to &s;ettle in England, it was long before the Engli&s;h were capable of fabricating cloth for foreign markets, and the export of unwrought wool &s;till continued to be the chief article of their commerce. Ander&s;on pa&s;&s;im. All foreign commodities were brought into England by the Lombard or Han&s;eatick merchants. The En|gli&s;h ports were frequented by &s;hips both from the north and &s;outh of Europe, and they tamely allowed foreigners to reap all the profits ari&s;ing from the &s;up|ply of their wants. The fir&s;t commercial treaty of England on record, is that with Haquin King or Nor|way, A. D. 1217. Ander&s;. vol. i. p. 108. But they did not venture to trade in their own &s;hips to the Baltick until the beginning of the fourteenth century. Ib. 151. It was after the middle of the fifteenth be|fore they &s;ent any &s;hips into the mediterranean. Ib. p. 177. Nor was it long before this period that their ve&s;&s;els vi&s;ited the ports of Spain or Portugal. But though I have pointed out the &s;low progre&s;s of the Engli&s;h commerce, as a fact little attended to, and yet meriting con&s;ideration; the concour&s;e of foreign|ers to the ports of England, together with the com|munication among all the different countries in Europe, which went on increa&s;ing from the beginning of the twelfth century, is &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify all the ob&s;erva|tions and rea&s;onings in the text concerning the influ|ence of commerce on the &s;tate of manners, and of &s;ociety.</P>

<HEAD>NOTE XXX. [GG.] SECT. III.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE not been able to di&s;cover the preci&s;e man|ner in which the Ju&s;tiza was appointed, Among the claims of the <HI>junta</HI> or <HI>union</HI> formed again&s;t James I. A. D. 1264, this was one; that the King &s;hould not nominate any per&s;on to be Ju&s;tiza without the con&s;ent or approbation of the ricos-hombres. Zurita Anales de Aragon, vol. i. p. 180. But the King in his an|&s;wer to their remon&s;trance a&s;&s;erts, "that it was e&s;tab|li&s;hed by immemorial practice, and was conformida|ble to the laws of the kingdom, that the King, in vir|tue of his royal prerogative, named the Ju&s;tiza. Zuri|ta, Ibid. 181. Blanca, 656. From another pa&s;&s;age in Zurita, it appears that while the Aragone&s;e enjoyed the privilege of <HI>the union,</HI> i. e. the power of confede|rating again&s;t their &s;overeign as often as they conceiv|ed that he had violated any of their rights and immu|nities. the Ju&s;tiza was not only nominated by the King, but held his office during his plea&s;ure. Nor was this practice attended with any bad effects, as the privilege of the union was a &s;ufficient and effectual check to any abu&s;e of the royal prerogative. But when the privilege of the union was aboli&s;hed as dan|gerous to the order and peace of &s;ociety, it was agreed that the Ju&s;tiza &s;hould continue in office during life. Several kings, however, attempted to remove the Ju&s;tizas who were obnoxious to them, and they &s;ome|times &s;ucceeded in the attempt. In order to guard again&s;t this encroachment, which would have de|&s;troyed the intention of the in&s;titution, and have ren|dered the Ju&s;tiza the dependant and tool of the crown, in&s;tead of the guardian of the people, a law was enact|ed in the Cortes, A. D. 1442, ordaining that the Ju&s;tiza &s;hould continue in office during life, and &s;hould not be removed from it unle&s;s by the authority of the Cortes. Fueros &amp; Ob&s;ervancial del Reyno de Arag. lib. i. p. 22. By former laws the per&s;on of the Ju&s;tiza had been declared &s;acred, and he was re|&s;pon&s;able only to the Cortes. Ibid. p. 15. b. Zurita and Blanca, who both publi&s;hed their hi&s;tories, while

the Ju&s;tiza of Aragon retained the full exerci&s;e of his privileges and juri&s;diction, have neglected to explain &s;everal circum&s;tances with regard to the office of that re&s;pectable magi&s;trate, becau&s;e they addre&s;&s;ed their works to their countrymen, who were well acquaint|ed with every particular concerning the functions of a judge, to whom they looked up as to the guardian of their liberties. It is in vain to con&s;ult the latter hi&s;torians of Spain, about any point, with re&s;pect to which the excellent hi&s;torians whom I have named are &s;ilent. The ancient con&s;titution of their country was overturned, and de&s;poti&s;m, e&s;tabli&s;hed on the ruin of its liberties, when the writers of this and the preceed|ing century compo&s;ed their hi&s;tories, and on that ac|count they had little curio&s;ity to know the nature of tho&s;e in&s;titutions to which their ance&s;tors owed the enjoyment of freedom, or they were afraid to de&s;cribe them with much accuracy. The &s;pirit with which Mariana, his continuator Miniana, and Ferreras, write their hi&s;tories, is very different from that of the two hi&s;torians of Aragon, from whom I have taken my account of the con&s;titution of that kingdom.</P>
<P>TWO circum&s;tances concerning the Ju&s;tiza, be&s;ides tho&s;e which I have mentioned in the text, are unwor|thy of ob&s;ervation. 1. None of the ricos-hombres, or noblemen of the fir&s;t order, could be appointed Ju&s;tiza. He was taken out of the &s;econd cla&s;s or ca|valleros, who an&s;wer nearly to gentlemen or com|moners in Great-Britain. Fueros &amp; Ob&s;ervanc. del Reyno, &amp;c. lib. 1. p. 21. b. The rea&s;on was. By the laws of Aragon, the ricos-hombres were not &s;ubject to capital puni&s;hment; but as it was nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ecurity of liberty, that the Ju&s;tiza &s;hould be accountable for the manner in which he executed the high tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him, it was a powerful re&s;traint upon him to know that he was liable to be puni&s;hed with the utmo&s;t rigour. Blanca, p. 657, 756. Zuri|ta, tom. ii. 229. Fueros &amp; Ob&s;ervanc. lib. ix. p. 182. b. 183. It appears too from many pa&s;&s;ages in Zurita, that the Ju&s;tiza was appointed to check the domineering and oppre&s;&s;ive &s;pirit of the nobles, as well as to &s;et bounds to the power of the monarch,

A MAGISTRATE po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch va&s;t powers as the Ju&s;tiza, might have exerci&s;ed them in a manner pernicious to the &s;tate, if he him&s;elf had been &s;ubject to no controul. A con&s;titutional remedy, however, was provided again&s;t this danger. Seventeen per&s;ons were cho&s;en by lot in each meeting of the Cortes. The&s;e formed a tribunal called the court of inqui&s;ition into the office of Ju&s;tiza. This court met at three &s;tated terms in each year. Every per&s;on had liberty of com|plaining to it of any inquiry or neglect of duty in the Ju&s;tiza, or in the inferior judges, who acted in his name. The Ju&s;tiza and his deputies were called to an|&s;wer for their conduct. The members of the court pa&s;&s;ed &s;entence by ballot. They might puni&s;h by de|gradation, confi&s;cation of goods, or even with death. The law which erected this court, and regulated the forms of its procedure, was enacted A. D. 1461. Zu|rita Anales, iv. 102. Blanca Comment. Rer. Aragon 770. Previous to this period, inquiry was made into the conduct of the Ju&s;tiza, though not with the &s;ame formality. He was from the fir&s;t in&s;titution of the of|fice &s;ubject to the review of the Cortes. The con&s;tant dread of &s;uch an impartial and &s;evere inquiry into his behaviour, was a powerful motive to the vigilant and faithful di&s;charge of his duty. A remarkable in&s;tance of the authority of the Ju&s;tiza when oppo&s;ed to that of the King, occurs, in the year 1386. By the con|&s;titution of Aragon, the elde&s;t &s;on or heir apparent of the crown po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed con&s;iderable power and juri&s;dicti|on in the kingdom. Fueros &amp; Ob&s;ervan. del Reyno de Arag. lib. 1. p. 16. Peter IV. in&s;tigated by a &s;e|cond wife, attempted to deprive his &s;on of this, and enjoined his &s;ubjects to yield him no obedience. The Prince immediately applied to the Ju&s;tiza; "the &s;afe|guard and defence, &s;ays Zurita, again&s;t all violence and oppre&s;&s;ion. The Ju&s;tiza granted him the <HI>firmo de derecho,</HI> the effect of which was, that upon his giving &s;urety to appear in judgment, he could not be depri|ved of any immunity or privilege, which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, but in con&s;equence of a legal trial before the Ju&s;tiza,

and of a &s;entence pronounced by him. This was pub|li&s;hed throughout the kingdom, and notwith&s;tanding the proclamation in contradiction to this which had been i&s;&s;ued by the King, the Prince continued in the exerci&s;e of all his rights, and his authority was univer|&s;ally recognized.

<P>I HAVE been induced by the concurring te&s;timony of many re&s;pectable authors, to mention this as the con&s;titutional form of the oath of allegiance, which the Aragone&s;e &s;wore to their Sovereigns. I mu&s;t ac|knowledge, however, that I have not found this &s;ingu|lar oath in any Spani&s;h author whom I have had an opportunity to con&s;ult. It is mentioned neither by Zurita, nor Blanca, nor Argen&s;ola, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Sayas, who were all hi&s;toriographers appointed by the Cortes of Aragon to record the tran&s;actions of the kingdom. All the&s;e writers po&s;&s;e&s;s a merit, which is very rare among hi&s;torians. They are extremely accurate in tracing the progre&s;s of the laws and con&s;titution of their country. Their &s;ilence with re&s;pect to this, cre|ates &s;ome &s;u&s;picion concerning the genuine&s;s of the oath. But as it is mentioned by &s;o many authors, who produce the ancient Spani&s;h words in which it is expre&s;&s;ed, it is probable that they have taken it from &s;ome writer of credit, who&s;e works have not fallen in|to my hands. The &s;pirit of the oath is perfectly agreeable to the genius of the Aragone&s;e con&s;titution.</P>
<P>THE privilege of Union which I mentioned in the preceding note, and alluded to in the text, is indeed one of the mo&s;t &s;ingular which could take place in a regular government, and the oath that I have menti|oned expre&s;&s;es nothing more than this con&s;titutional privilege entitled the Aragone&s;e to perform. If the King or his Mini&s;ters violated any of the laws or immu|nities of the Aragone&s;e, and did not grant immediate redre&s;s in con&s;equence of their repre&s;entations and re|mon&s;trances, the nobles of the fir&s;t rank, or <HI>Ricos-hom|bres de natura. &amp; de me&s;nada,</HI> the eque&s;trian order, or

the nobility of the &s;econd cla&s;s, called <HI>Hidalgos &amp; In|fanciones,</HI> together with the magi&s;trates of cities, might either in the cortes, or in a voluntary a&s;&s;embly, join in union, and binding them&s;elves by mutual oaths and the exchange of ho&s;tages to be faithful to each other, they might require the King, in the name and by the authority of this body corporate, to grant them redre&s;s. If the King refu&s;ed to comply with their re|que&s;t, or took arms in order to oppo&s;e them, they might, in virtue of the privilege of union, in&s;tantly withdraw their allegiance from the King, refu&s;e to acknowledge him as their Sovereign, and proceed to elect another Monarch; nor did they incur any guilt, or become liable to any pro&s;ecution on that account. Blanca Com. Rer. Arag. 661. 669. This union did not re&s;emble the confederacies in other feudal king|doms. It was a con&s;titutional a&s;&s;ociation, which pre|tended to legal privileges, which i&s;&s;ued its mandates under a common &s;eal, and proceeded in all its operati|ons by regular and a&s;certained forms. This dangerous right was not only claimed, but exerci&s;ed in the year 1287, the Aragone&s;e formed an union in oppo&s;ition to Alfon&s;o III. and obliged the King not only to comply with their demands, but to ratify a privilege &s;o fatal to the power of the crown, Zurita Anales, tom. i. p. 322. In the year 1347, an union was formed again&s;t Pe|ter IV. with equal &s;ucce&s;s, and a new ratification of the privilege was extorted. Zurita, tom. ii. p. 202. But &s;oon after, the King having defeated the leaders of the uni|on in battle, the privilege of union was finally abro|gated in the Cortes, and all the laws or records which contained any confirmation of it, were cancelled or de&s;troyed. The King, in pre&s;ence of the Cortes, call|ed for the act whereby he had ratified the union, and having wounded his hand with his poiniard, he held it above the record, <Q>That privilege, &s;ays he, which has been &s;o fatal to the kingdom, and &s;o injurious to royalty, &s;hould be effaced with the blood of a King.</Q> Zurita, tom. ii. p. 229. The law abo|li&s;hing the union is publi&s;hed. Fueros &amp; Ob&s;ervanc. lib. ix. p. 178. From that period the Ju&s;tiza became the con&s;titutional guardian of public liberty, and his

power and juri&s;diction occa&s;ioned none of tho&s;e vio|lent convul&s;ions which the tumultuary privilege of the union was apt to produce. The con&s;titution of Aragon, however, &s;till remained extremely free. One &s;ource of this liberty was from the early admi&s;&s;ion of the repre&s;entatives of cities into the Cortes. It &s;eems probable, from Zurita, that the burge&s;&s;es were con|&s;tituent members of the Cortes from its fir&s;t in&s;tituti|on. He mentions a meeting of Cortes, A. D. 1133, in which the <HI>procuradores de las ciudades y villas</HI> were pre&s;ent. Tom. i. p. 51. This is the con&s;titutional language in which their pre&s;ence is declared in the Cortes. after the journals of that court were regularly kept. It is probable, that an hi&s;torian &s;o accurate as Zurita, would not have u&s;ed the&s;e words, if he had not taken them from &s;ome authentick record. It was more than a century after this period before the repre&s;entatives of cities formed a con&s;tituent part in the &s;upreme a&s;&s;emblies of the other European nations. The free &s;pirit of the Aragone&s;e government is con&s;pi|cuous in many particulars. The Cortes not only op|po&s;ed the attempts of their Kings to increa&s;e their re|venue, or to extend their prerogative, but they claim|ed right and exerci&s;ed powers which will appear ex|traordinary even in a country accu&s;tomed to the en|joyment of liberty. In the year 1286, the Cortes claimed the privilege of naming the members of the King's council and the officers of his hou&s;hold, and they &s;eem to have obtained it for &s;ome time. Zurita, tom. i. p. 303, 307. It was the privilege of the Cortes to name the officers who commanded the troops rai&s;ed by their authority. This &s;eems to be evident from a pa&s;&s;age in Zurita. When the Cortes, in the year 1503, rai&s;ed a body of troops to be employed in Italy, it pa&s;&s;ed an act empowering the King to name the officers who &s;hould command them, Zurita, tom. v. p. 274; which plainly implies that without this warrant, it did not belong to him in virtue of his pre|rogative. In the Fueros and Ob&s;ervancias del reyno de Aragon, two general declarations of the rights and privileges of the Aragone&s;e are publi&s;hed; the one in the reign of Pedro I. A. D. 1284, the other in that
<PB N="291" REF="011837_0311_0F9D86ACB0AC7300">
of James II. A. D. 1323. They are of &s;uch length, that I cannot in&s;ert them, but it is evident from the&s;e, that not only the privileges of the nobility, but the rights of the people, per&s;onal as well as political, were, at that period, more exten&s;ive, and better under&s;tood than in any kingdom in Europe. Lib. 1. p. 7, 9. The oath by which the King bound him&s;elf to ob&s;erve tho&s;e rights and liberties of the people, was very &s;olemn. Ibid. p. 14. b. &amp; p. 15. The Cortes of Aragon di&s;covered not only the jealou&s;y and vigilance, which are peculiar to free &s;tates, in guarding the e&s;|&s;ential parts of the con&s;titution, but they were &s;cru|pulou&s;ly attentive to ob&s;erve the mo&s;t minute forms and ceremonies to which they were accu&s;tomed. Ac|cording to the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws and cu&s;toms of Ara|gon, no foreigner had liberty to enter the hall in which the Cortes a&s;&s;embled. Ferdinand, in the year 1481, appointed his Queen, I&s;abella, regent of the kingdom, while he was ab&s;ent during the cour&s;e of the campaign. The law required that a regent &s;hould take the oath of fidelity in pre&s;ence of the Cortes; but as I&s;abella was a foreigner, before &s;he could be admitted, the Cortes thought it nece&s;&s;ary to pa&s;s an act authorizing the &s;erjeant-porter to open the door of the hall, and to al|low her to enter; <Q>&s;o attentive were they, &s;ays Zu|rita, to ob&s;erve their laws and forms, even &s;uch as may &s;eem mo&s;t minute.</Q> Tom. iv. p. 313.</P>
<P>THE Aragone&s;e were no le&s;s &s;olicitous to &s;ecure the per&s;onal rights of individuals, than to maintain the freedom of the con&s;titution; and the &s;pirit of their &s;tatutes with re&s;pect to both was equally liberal. Two facts relative to this matter merit ob&s;ervation. By an expre&s;s &s;tatute in the year 1325, it was declared to be unlawful to put any native Aragone&s;e to the tor|ture. If he could not be convicted by the te&s;timony of witne&s;&s;es, he was in&s;tantly ab&s;olved. Zurita, tom. ii. p. 66. Zurita records the regulation with the &s;a|tisfaction natural to an hi&s;torian, when he contem|plates the humanity of his countrymen. He compares the laws of Aragon to tho&s;e of Rome, as both exempt|ed citizens and freemen from &s;uch ignominious and cruel treatment, and had recour&s;e to it only in the tri|al
<PB N="292" REF="011837_0312_0F9D86AD71ECD2A0">
of &s;laves. Zurita had rea&s;on to be&s;tow &s;uch an en|comium on the laws of his country. Torture was at that time permitted by the laws of every other nation in Europe. Even in England, from which the mild &s;pirit of legi&s;lation has long bani&s;hed it, torture was not, at that time, unknown. Ob&s;ervations on the Statutes, chiefly the more antient, &amp;c. p. 66.</P>
<P>THE other fact &s;hows, that the &s;ame &s;pirit which influenced the legi&s;lature, prevailed among the people. In the year 1485, the religious zeal of Fer|dinand and I&s;abella, prompted them to introduce the inqu&s;ition into Aragon. Though the Aragone&s;e were no le&s;s &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly attached, than the other Spa|niards, to the Roman Catholick faith, and no le&s;s de|&s;irous to root out the &s;eeds of error and of here&s;y which the Jews and Moors had &s;cattered, yet they took arms again&s;t the inqui&s;itors, murdered the chief inqui&s;itor, and long oppo&s;ed the e&s;tabli&s;hment of that tribunal. The rea&s;on which they gave for their con|duct, was, that the mode of trial in the inqui&s;ition, was incon&s;i&s;tent with liberty. The criminal was not confronted with the witne&s;&s;es, he was not acquainted with what they depo&s;ed again&s;t him, he was &s;ub|jected to torture, and the goods of per&s;ons condemn|ed were confi&s;cated. Zurita Anales, tom. iv. p. 341.</P>
<P>THE form of Government in the kingdom of Va|lencia, and principality of Catalonia, which were an|nexed to the crown of Aragon, was likewi&s;e extreme|ly favourable to liberty. The Valencians enjoyed the privilege of <HI>union</HI> in the &s;ame manner with the Aragone&s;e. But they had no magi&s;trate re&s;embling the Ju&s;tiza. The Catalonians were no le&s;s jealous of their liberties than the two other nations, and no le&s;s bold in a&s;&s;erting them. But it is not nece&s;&s;ary for il|lu&s;trating the following hi&s;tory, to enter into any farther detail concerning the peculiarities in the con|&s;titution of the&s;e kingdoms.</P>

<PB N="293" REF="011837_0313_0F9D86AE2FFBC0A0">
&s;ame degree of accuracy, wherewith I have de&s;cribed the political &s;tate of Aragon. It is manife&s;t, not on|ly from the hi&s;torians of Ca&s;tile, but from its ancient laws, particularly the Fuero Juzgo, that its monarchs were originally elective. Ley 2, 5, 8. They were cho&s;en by the bi&s;hops, the nobility, and the people, ibid. It appears from the &s;ame venerable code of laws, that the prerogative of the Ca&s;tilian monarchs was extremly limited. Villaldiego in his commentary on the&s;e laws, produces many facts and authorities in confirmation of both the&s;e particulars. Dr. Ged|des, who was well acquainted with Spani&s;h lite|rature, complains that he could find no author who gave a di&s;tinct account of the Cortes, or &s;upreme a&s;|&s;embly of the nation, or who de&s;cribed the manner in which it was held, or mentioned the preci&s;e num|ber of members who had a right to &s;it in it. He pro|duces, however, from Gil Gonzales d'Avila, who publi&s;hed a hi&s;tory of Henry II. the writ of &s;ummons to the town of Abula, requiring it to chu&s;e repre&s;en|tatives to appear in the Cortes which he called to meet A. D. 1390. From this we learn, that Prelates, Dukes, Marqui&s;&s;es, the ma&s;ters of the three military orders, Conde's and Riccos-hombres were required to attend. The&s;e compo&s;ed the bodies of eccle&s;ia&s;ticks and nobles, which formed two members of the legi&s;|lature. The cities which &s;ent members to that meet|ing of the Cortes, were forty-eight. The number of repre&s;entatives (for the cities had right to chu&s;e more or fewer, according to their re&s;pective dignity) amounted to an hundred and twenty-five. Geddes Mi&s;cellaneous Tracts, vol. i. 331. Zurita having occa&s;ion to mention the Cortes which Ferdinand held at Toro, A. D. 1505, in order to &s;ecure to him&s;elf the government of Ca&s;tile after the death of I&s;abella, records with his u&s;ual accuracy, the names of the members pre&s;ent, and of the cities which they repre|&s;ented. From that li&s;t it appears, that only eighteen cities had deputies in this a&s;&s;embly. Annales de Ara|gon, tom. vi. p. 3. What was the occa&s;ion of this great inequality, in the number of cities repre&s;ented in the&s;e two meetings of the Cortes, I am unable to explain.</P>

<P>A GREAT part of the territory in Spain was en|gro&s;&s;ed by the nobility. L. Marinaeus Siculus, who compo&s;ed his treati&s;e de Rebus Hi&s;paniae during the reign of Charles V. gives a catalogue of the Spani&s;h nobility, together with the yearly rent of their e&s;tates. According to his account, which he affirms was as accurate as the nature the &s;ubject would admit, the &s;um total of the annual revenue of their lands amount|ed to one million four hundred and eighty-two thou|&s;and ducats. If we make allowance for the va&s;t differ|ence in the value of money in the fifteenth century, from that which it now bears, and con&s;ider that the catalogue of Marinaeus includes only the <HI>Titulados,</HI> or nobility, who&s;e families were di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;ome honorary title, their wealth mu&s;t appear very great. L. Marinaeus ap. Schotti Scriptores Hi&s;pan. vol. i. p. 323. The Commons of Ca&s;tile, in their conte&s;ts with the crown, which I &s;hall hereafter relate, com|plain of the exten&s;ive property of the nobility, as ex|tremely pernicious to the kingdom. In one of their manife&s;to's they a&s;&s;ert, that from Valladolid to St. Ja|go in Galicia, which was an hundred leagues, the crown did not po&s;&s;e&s;s more than three villages. All the re&s;t belonged to the nobility, and could be &s;ubject|ed to no public burden. Sandov. Vida del Emperor, Carl. V. vol. 1. p. 422.

It is probable, that as &s;oon as the&s;e were recovered from the Moors, the inhabitants who fixed their re&s;idence in them, be|ing per&s;ons of di&s;tinction and credit, had all the privi|leges of municipal government and juri&s;diction, con|ferred upon them. Many &s;triking proofs occur of the &s;plendour, wealth, and power of the Spani&s;h cities. Hieronymus Paulus wrote a de&s;cription of Barcelona in the year 1491, and compares the dimen&s;ions of the town to that of Naples, and the elegance of its build|ings, the variety of its manufactures, and the extent of its commerce to Florence, Hieron. Paulus ap. Scottum. Script. Hi&s;p. ii. 844., Marinaeus de&s;cribes Toledo as a large and populous city. A great number of its inhabitants were per&s;ons of quality, and of illu&s;|trious rank. Its commerce was great. It applied par|ticularly to the manufactures of &s;ilk and wool; and the number of inhabitants employed in the&s;e two branches of trade, amounted nearly to ten thou&s;and. Marin. ubi &s;upr. p. 308. I know no city, &s;ays he, that I would prefer to Valladolid for elegance and &s;plendour. Ibid. p. 312. We may form &s;ome e&s;ti|mate of its populou&s;ne&s;s from the following circum|&s;tances. The citizens took arms in the year 1516, in order to oppo&s;e a mea&s;ure concerted by cardinal Ximenes, and they mu&s;tered in the city, and in the territory which belonged to it, thirty thou&s;and fight|ing men. Sandow. Vida del Emper. Carl. V. tom. i. p. 81. The manufactures carried on in the towns of Spain, were not intended merely for home con|&s;umption, they were exported to foreign countries, and that commerce was a con&s;iderable &s;ource of wealth to the inhabitants. The maritime laws of Barcelona, are the foundation of mercantile juri&s;prudence in mo|dern times, as the Leges Rhodiae were among the ancients. All the commercial &s;tates in Italy adopted the&s;e laws, and regulated their trade according to them. Sandi Storia Civile Veneziana, vol, ii. 865.

<P>THE military order of St. Jago, the mo&s;t honour|able and opulent of the three Spani&s;h orders, was in|&s;tituted about the year 1170. The bull of confirma|tion by Alexander III. is dated A. D. 1176. At that time a con&s;iderable part of Spain was &s;ubject to the Moors, and the whole country much expo&s;ed to the depredations, not only of the enemy, but of ban|ditti. It is no wonder, then, that an in&s;titution, the object of which was to oppo&s;e the enemies of the Chri&s;|tian faith, and to re&s;train and puni&s;h tho&s;e who di&s;|turbed the public peace, &s;hould be extremely popular, and meet with general encouragement. The wealth and power of the order became &s;o great, that one hi&s;|torian &s;ays, that the Grand Ma&s;ter of St. Jago, was the per&s;on in Spain of the greate&s;t power and dignity next to the King. Ael. Anton. Nebri&s;&s;en&s;is, ap. Schott. Scrip. Hi&s;p. i. 812. Another ob&s;erves, that the or|der po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every thing in Ca&s;tile that a King would mo&s;t de&s;ire to obtain. Zurita Anales, v. 22. The knights took the vows of obedience, of poverty, and of conjugal cha&s;tity. By the former they were bound implicitly to obey the commands of their grandma&s;ter. The order could bring into the field a thou&s;and men at arms. Ael. Ant. Nebre&s;. p. 813. If the&s;e men at arms were accompanied as was u&s;ual in that age, this was a formidable body of cavalry. There belonged to this order eighty-four commanderies, and two hundred priories and other benefices.

is ea&s;y to &s;ee how formidable to his &s;overeign the com|mand of the&s;e troops, the admini&s;tration of &s;uch re|venues, and the di&s;po&s;al of &s;o many offices, mu&s;t have rendered a &s;ubject. The other two orders though, inferior to that of St. Jago in power and wealth, were neverthele&s;s very con&s;iderable. When the conque&s;t of Granada deprived the knights of St. Jago of tho&s;e enemies again&s;t whom their zeal was originally direct|ed, &s;uper&s;tition found out a new object, in defence of which they engaged to employ their courage. To their u&s;ual oath, they added the following clau&s;e: "We &s;wear to believe, to maintain, and to contend in public and in private, that the Virgin Mary, the mother of God, our Lady, was conceived without the &s;tain of original &s;in." This &s;ingular addition was made about the middle of the &s;eventeenth century. Honor&egrave; de St. Marie Di&s;&s;ertations, &amp;c. p. 263.</P>

<P>I HAVE frequently had occa&s;ion to take notice of the defects in police during the middle ages, occa&s;ion|ed by the feeblene&s;s of Government, and the want of proper &s;ubordination among the different ranks of men. I have ob&s;erved in a former note, that this greatly in|terrupted the intercour&s;e between nations, and even between different places in the &s;ame kingdom. The de&s;cription which the Spani&s;h hi&s;torians give of the frequency of rapine, murder, and every act of vio|lence, in all the provinces of Spain, are amazing, and pre&s;ent to us the idea of Society but little removed from the di&s;order and turbulence of that which has been called a &s;tate of nature.

Though the acce&s;s of the&s;e di&s;orders rendered the in&s;titution of the <HI>Santa Hermandad</HI> nece&s;&s;ary, great care was taken at fir&s;t to avoid giving any offence or alarm to the nobility. The juri&s;diction of the judges of the Hermandad, was expre&s;sly confined to crimes that violated the public peace. All other offences were left to the cognizance of the ordinary judges. If a per&s;on was guilty of

the mo&s;t notorious perjury, in any trial before a judge of the Hermandad, he could not puni&s;h him, but was obliged to remit the ca&s;e to the ordinary judge of the place.

Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e re&s;trictions, the Ba|rons were &s;en&s;ible how much the Hermandad would encroach on their juri&s;diction. In Ca&s;tile. &s;ome op|po&s;ition was made to the in&s;titution; but Ferdinand had the addre&s;s to obtain the con&s;ent of the Con&s;table to the introduction of the Hermandad into that part of the kingdom where his e&s;tate lay; and by that means, as well as the popularity of the in&s;titution, he &s;urmounted every ob&s;tacle that &s;tood in its way. Ael. Ant. Nebri&s;&s;en. 851. In Aragon the Nobles combined again&s;t it with greater &s;pirit; and Ferdi|nand, though he &s;upported it with vigour, was obliged to make &s;ome conce&s;&s;ions in order to reconcile them. Zurita Anales de Arag. iv. 356. The power and revenue of the Hermandad in Ca&s;tile &s;eems to have been very great&punc; Ferdinand, when preparing for the war again&s;t the Moors of Granada, required of the Hermandad to furni&s;h him &s;ixteen thou&s;and bea&s;ts of burden, together with eight thou&s;and men to conduct them, and he obtained what he demanded, Ael. Ant. Nebri&s;&s;. 881. The Hermandad has found to be of &s;o much u&s;e in pre&s;erving peace, and re&s;training or de|tecting crimes, that it is &s;till continued in Spain, al|though it be no longer nece&s;&s;ary either for moderat|ing the power of the nobility, or extending that of the crown.</P>

<P>NOTHING is more common among Antiquarians, and there is not a more copious &s;ource of error, than to decide concerning the in&s;titutions and manners of pa&s;t ages, by the forms and ideas which prevail in their own times. The French lawyers in the &s;eventeenth and eighteenth centuries having found their &s;ove|reigns in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of ab&s;olute, power, &s;eem to think it a duty incumbent on them, to maintain that &s;uch

unbounded authority belonged to the crown in every period of their monarchy. "The government of France, &s;ays M. de Real very gravely, is purely mo|narchical at this day, as it was from the beginning. Our Kings were ab&s;olute originally as they are at pre|&s;ent." Science du Government, tom. ii. p. 31. It is impo&s;&s;ible, however, to conceive two &s;tates of civil &s;ociety more unlike to each other, than that of the French nation under Clovis, and that under Louis XV. It is evident from the codes of laws of the vari|ous tribes which &s;ettled in Gaul and the countries ad|jacent to it, as well as from the hi&s;tory of Gregory of Tours, and other early annali&s;ts, that among all the&s;e people the form of government was extremely rude and &s;imple, and that they had &s;carce begun to acquire the fir&s;t rudiments of that order and police which are nece&s;&s;ary in exten&s;ive &s;ocieties. The King or leader had the command of &s;oldiers or companions, who fol|lowed his &s;tandard from choice, not by con&s;traint. I have produced the cleare&s;t evidence of this, Note VI. An event related by Gregory of Tours, lib. iv. c. 14, affords the mo&s;t &s;triking proof of the dependance of the early French Kings on the &s;entiments and inclina|tions of their people. Clotaire I. having marched at the head of his army, in the year 553, again&s;t the Sax|ons, that people, intimidated at his approach &s;ued for peace, and offered to pay a large &s;um to the offended monarch. Clotaire was willing to clo&s;e with what they propo&s;ed. But his army in&s;i&s;ted to be led forth to battle. The King employed all his eloquence to per&s;uade them to accept of what the Saxons were ready to pay. The Saxons, in order to &s;ooth them, increa&s;|ed their original offer. The King renewed his &s;olici|tations: But the army enraged, ru&s;hed upon the King, tore his tent in pieces, dragged him out of it, and would have &s;lain him on the &s;pot, if he had not con&s;ented to lead them in&s;tantly again&s;t the enemy.</P>
<P>IF the early monarchs of France po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch li|mited authority, even while at the head of their ar|my, their prerogative during peace will be found to be &s;till more confined. They a&s;cended the throne not

by any hereditary right, but in con&s;equence of the election of their &s;ubjects. In order to avoid an unne|ce&s;&s;ary number of quotations, I refer my readers to Hottomanni Francogallia, cap. vi. p. 47. edit. 1573, where they will find the fulle&s;t proof of this from Gre|gory of Tours, Amoinus, and the mo&s;t authentick hi&s;torians of the Merovingian Kings. The effect of this election was not to inve&s;t them with ab&s;olute pow|er. Whatever related to the general welfare of the nation, was &s;ubmitted to publick deliberation, and determined by the &s;uffrage of the people, in the an|nual a&s;&s;emblies called Les Champs des Mars, and Les Champs de Mai. The&s;e a&s;&s;emblies were called <HI>Champs,</HI> becau&s;e, according to the cu&s;tom of all the barbarous nations, they were held in the open air, in &s;ome plain capable of containing the va&s;t number of per&s;ons who had a right to be pre&s;ent.

<P>THAT the general a&s;&s;emblies exerci&s;ed &s;upreme ju|ri&s;diction over all per&s;ons, and with re&s;pect to all cau|&s;es, is &s;o evident as to &s;tand in need of no proof. The trial of Brunchaut. A. D. 613, how unju&s;t &s;oever the &s;entence again&s;t her may be, as related by Fredegari|us, Chron. cap. 42. Bouquet, ibid. 430. is in it&s;elf &s;ufficient proof of this. The notorious violence and ini|quity of the &s;entence &s;erve to demon&s;trate the extent
<PB N="302" REF="011837_0322_0F9D86B5B3F4DF70">
of juri&s;diction which this a&s;&s;embly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, as a Prince &s;o &s;anguinary as Clothaire II. thought the &s;anction of its authority would be &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify his rigour|ous treatment of the mother and grandmother of &s;o many Kings.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to conferring donatives on the Prince, we may ob&s;erve that among nations who&s;e manners and political in&s;titutions are &s;imple, the publick, as well as individuals, having few wants, they are unac|quainted with taxes, and free uncivilized tribes di&s;dain to &s;ubmit to any &s;tated impo&s;ition. This was remark|ably the ca&s;e of the Germans, and of all the various people that i&s;&s;ued from that country. Tacitus pronoun|ces two tribes not to be of the German origin, becau&s;e they &s;ubmitted to pay taxes. De Morib. Germ. c. 43; and &s;peaking of another tribe according to the ideas prevalent in Germany, he &s;ays, "they were not de|graded by the impo&s;ition of taxes." Ibid c. 29. Up|on their &s;ettlement in Gaul, we may conclude that while elated with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of victory, they would not renounce the high-&s;pirited ideas of their ance&s;tors, or voluntarily &s;ubmit to a burthen which they regarded as a badge of &s;ervitude. The evidence of the earlie&s;t records and hi&s;torians ju&s;tify this con|clu&s;ion. M. de Monte&s;quieu in the twelfth and &s;ub|&s;equent chapters of the thirteenth book of l'E&s;prit des Loix, and M. de Mably Ob&s;ervat. &s;ur l'Hi&s;t. de France, tom. i. p. 247. have inve&s;tigated this fact with great attention, and have proved clearly that the property of no free-man among the Franks was &s;ubject to any &s;tated tax. That the &s;tate required nothing from per|&s;ons of this rank but military &s;ervice at their own ex|pence, and that they &s;hould entertain the King in their hou&s;es when he was upon any progre&s;s through his dominions, or his officers when &s;ent on any public employment, furni&s;hing them with carriages and hor|&s;es. Monarchs &s;ub&s;i&s;ted almo&s;t entirely upon the re|venues of their own domains, and upon the perqui|&s;ites ari&s;ing from the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, toge|ther with a few &s;mall fines and forfeitures exacted from tho&s;e who had been guilty of certain tre&s;pa&s;&s;es. It is

foreign from my &s;ubject to ennumerate the&s;e. The reader may find them in Ob&s;ervat. de M. de Mably, vol. i. p. 267.</P>
<P>WHEN any extraordinary aid was granted by free|men to their &s;overeign it was purely voluntary. In the annual a&s;&s;embly of March or May it was the cu&s;tom to make the King a pre&s;ent of money, of hor&s;es or arms, or of &s;ome other thing of value. This was an ancient cu&s;tom, and derived from their ance&s;tors the Germans. Mos e&s;t civitatibus, ultro ac viritim con|ferri principibus vel armentorum vel frugum, quod pro honore acceptum, etiam nece&s;&s;itatibus &s;ubvenit. Ta|cit. de Mor. Germ. c. 15. The&s;e gifts, if we may form a judgment concerning them from the general terms in which they are mentioned by the ancient hi&s;torians, were con&s;iderable, and made no &s;mall part of the roy|al revenue. Many pa&s;&s;ages to this purpo&s;e are produ|ced by M. du Cange, Di&s;&s;ert. iv. &s;ur Joinville, 153. Sometimes a conquered people &s;pecified the gift which they bound them&s;elves to pay annually, and it was exacted as a debt if they failed. Annales Meten&s;es, ap. Du Cange, ibid. p. 155. It is probable that the fir&s;t &s;tep towards taxation was to a&s;certain the value of the&s;e gifts which were originally gratuitous, and to compel the people to pay the &s;um at which they were rated. Still, however, &s;ome memory of their original was pre&s;erved, and the aids granted to monarchs in all the kingdoms of Europe were termed benevolences or free gifts.</P>
<P>THE Kings of the &s;econd race in France were rai&s;ed to the throne by the election of the people, Pepinus Rex pius, &s;ays an author who wrote a few years after the tran&s;action which he records, per authoritatem Papae, &amp; unctionem &s;ancti chri&s;matis, &amp; electionem omnium Francorum in regni &s;olio &s;ublimatus e&s;t. Clau&s;ula de Pepini con&s;ecratione ap. Bouq. Recueil des Hi&s;tor. tom. v. p. 9. At the &s;ame time, as the chief men of the nation had transferred the crown from one family to another, an oath was exacted of them that they &s;hould maintain on the throne the family which they had now promoted; ut nunquam de alterius lum|bis
<PB N="304" REF="011837_0324_0F9D86B7301E2D20">
regem in aevo prae&s;umant eligere. Ibid. p. 10. This oath the nation faithfully ob&s;erved during a con&s;ide|rable &s;pace of time. The po&s;terity of Pepin kept po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne; but with re&s;pect to the manner of dividing their dominions among their children, Princes were obliged to con&s;ult the general a&s;&s;embly of the nation. Thus Pepin him&s;elf, A. D. 768, ap|pointed his two &s;ons, Charles and Charlomannus, to reign as joint &s;overeigns; but he did this, una cum concen&s;u Francorum &amp; procerum &s;uorum &s;eu &amp; epi&s;|coporum, before whom he laid the matter in their ge|neral a&s;&s;embly. Conventus apud &s;anctum Diony&s;ium. Capitular. vol. i. p. 187. This de&s;tination the French confirmed in a &s;ub&s;equent a&s;&s;embly, which was called upon the death of Pepin; for, as Eginhart relates, they not only appointed them Kings, but by their au|thority they regulated the limits of their re&s;pective ter|ritories, Vita Car. Magni. ap. Bouquet Recueil, tom. v. p. 90. In the &s;ame manner, it was by the authori|ty of the &s;upreme a&s;&s;emblies that any di&s;pute which aro&s;e among the de&s;cendants of the royal family was determined. Charlemagne recognizes this important part of their juri&s;diction, and confirms it in his charter concerning the partition of his dominions; for he ap|points, that, in ca&s;e of any uncertainty with re&s;pect to the right of the &s;everal competitors, he whom the people &s;hall chu&s;e, &s;hall &s;ucceed to the crown. Capi|tular, vol. i. 442.</P>
<P>UNDER the &s;econd race of Kings, the a&s;&s;embly of the nation, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of coventus, Malli, Placita, were regularly a&s;&s;embled once a year at lea&s;t, and frequently twice in the year. One of the mo&s;t valuable monuments of the hi&s;tory of France is the treati&s;e of Hincmarus, archbi&s;hop of Rheims, de ordine Palatii. He died A. D. 882. only &s;ixty-eight years after Charlemagne, and he relates in that &s;hort di&s;|cour&s;e the facts which were communicated to him by Adalhardus, a mini&s;ter and confident of Charlemagne. From him we learn that this great monarch never failed to hold the general a&s;&s;embly of his &s;ubjects every year. In quo placito generalitas univer&s;orum majorum tam

clericorum quam laicorum conveniebat. Hincm. oper. edit. Sirmondi, vol. ii. c. 29. 211. In the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies, matters which related to the general &s;afety and &s;tate of the kingdom were always di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, before they en|tered upon any private or le&s;s important bu&s;ine&s;s. Ibid. c. 33. p. 213. His immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ors imitated his example, and tran&s;acted no affair of importance without the advice of their great council.</P>
<P>UNDER the &s;econd race of Kings; the genius of the French government continued to be in a good mea&s;ure democratical. The nobles the dignified eccle&s;ia&s;tics, and the great officers of the crown, were not the only mem|bers of the national council; the people, or the whole body of free-men, either in per&s;on, or by their repre|&s;entatives, had a right to be pre&s;ent in it. Hincma|rus, in de&s;cribing the manner of holding the general a&s;&s;emblies, &s;ays, that if the weather was favourable, they met in the open air, but, if otherwi&s;e, they had different apartments allotted to them, &s;o that the dig|nified clergy were &s;eparated from the laity, and the comites vel huju&s;modi principes &s;ibimet honorificabili|ter a caetera multitudine &s;egregarentur. Ibid. p. c. 35. p. 114. Agobardus, archbi&s;hop of Lyons, thus de|&s;cribes a national council in the year 833, wherein he was pre&s;ent. Qui ubique conventus extitit ex reve|renti&s;&s;imis epi&s;copis, &amp; magnificenti&s;&s;imis viris inlu|&s;tribus, collegio quoque abatum &amp; comitum, promi&s;|cuaeque aetatis &amp; dignitatis populo. The <HI>caetera multi|tudo</HI> of Hincmarus is the &s;ame with the <HI>populus</HI> of Ago|bardus, and both de&s;cribe the inferior order of free|men, the &s;ame who were afterwards known in France by the name of the third e&s;tate, and in England by the name of commons. The people, as well as the mem|bers of higher dignity, were admitted to a &s;hare of the legi&s;lative power. Thus, by a law, A. D. 803, it is ordained, "that the que&s;tion &s;hall be put to the people with re&s;pect to every new law, and if they &s;hall agree to it, they &s;hall confirm it by their &s;ignature. Capit. vol. i. 394. There are two capitularia which convey to us a full idea of the part which the people had in the admini&s;tration of government. When they felt the weight of any grievance, they had a right to
<PB N="306" REF="011837_0326_0F9D86B8E349CC58">
petition the &s;overeign for redre&s;s. One of the&s;e peti|tions, in which they de&s;ire that eccle&s;ia&s;ticks might be exempted from bearing arms, and from &s;erving in per&s;on again&s;t the enemy, is &s;till extant. It is ad|dre&s;&s;ed to Charlemagne, A. D. 803, and expre&s;&s;ed in &s;uch terms as could have been u&s;ed only by men con&s;cious of liberty, and of the exten&s;ive privileges which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. They conclude with requiring him to grant their demand, if he wi&s;hed that they &s;hould any longer continue faithful &s;ubjects to him. That great monarch, in&s;tead of being offended or &s;ur|prized at the boldne&s;s of their petition, received it in a mo&s;t gracious manner, and &s;ignified his willingne&s;s to comply with it. But &s;en&s;ible that he him&s;elf did not po&s;&s;e&s;s legi&s;lative authority, he promi&s;es to lay the matter before the next general a&s;&s;embly, that &s;uch things as were of common concern to all might be there con&s;idered and e&s;tabli&s;hed by common con&s;ent. Capitul. tom. i. p. 405&mdash;409. As the people by their petitions brought matters to be propo&s;ed in the general a&s;&s;embly, we learn from another capitulare the form in which they were approved there, and enacted as laws. The propo&s;itions were read aloud, and then the people were required to declare whether they a&s;&s;ented to them or not. They &s;ignified their a&s;&s;ent by crying three times, "We are &s;atisfied," and then the capitulare was confirmed by the &s;ub&s;crip|tion of the monarch, the clergy and the chief men of the laity. Capitul. tom. i. p. 627. A. D. 822. It &s;eems probable from a capitulare of Carolus Calvus, A. D. 851, that the &s;overeign could not refu&s;e his a&s;&s;ent to what was propo&s;ed and e&s;tabli&s;hed by his &s;ub|jects in the general a&s;&s;embly. Tit. ix. &sect; 6. Capi|tul. vol. ii. p. 47. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to multiply quotations concerning the legi&s;lative power of the nati|onal a&s;&s;embly of France under the &s;econd race, or concerning its rights to determine with regard to peace and war. The uniform &s;tyle of the Capitula|ria is an abundant confirmation of the former. The reader who de&s;ires any farther information with re&s;pect to the latter, may con&s;ult Les Origines ou l'Ancien Gouvernement de la France, tom. iii. p. 87. &amp;c.

What has been &s;aid with re&s;pect to the admi&s;&s;ion of the people or their repre&s;entatives in the &s;upreme a&s;&s;embly merits attention not only in tracing the progre&s;s of the French government, but on account of the light which it throws upon a &s;imilar que&s;tion agitated in England, concerning the time when the commons be|came part of the legi&s;lative body in that kingdom.</P>

<HEAD>NOTE XXXVIII. [PP]. SECT. III.</HEAD>
<P>THAT important change which the con&s;titution of France underwent, when the legi&s;lative power was transferred from the great council of the nation to the King, has been explained by the French antiquarians with le&s;s care, than they be&s;tow in illu&s;trating other events in their hi&s;tory. For that rea&s;on I have endea|voured with the greater attention to trace the &s;teps which led to this memorable revolution. I &s;hall here add &s;ome particulars which tend farther to illu&s;trate it. The Leges Salicae, the Leges Burgundionum, and other codes publi&s;hed by the &s;everal tribes which &s;et|tled in Gaul, were general laws extending to every per&s;on, to every province and di&s;trict where their au|thority was acknowledged. But they &s;eem to have become ob&s;olete; and the rea&s;on of their falling into di&s;u&s;e is very obvious. Almo&s;t the whole property of the nation was allodial when the&s;e laws were fram|ed. But when the feudal in&s;titutions became gene|ral, and gave ri&s;e to an infinite variety of que&s;tions peculi|ar to that &s;pecies of tenure, the ancient codes were of no u&s;e in deciding with regard to the&s;e, becau&s;e they could not contain regulations applicable to ca&s;es which did not exi&s;t at the time when they were compiled. This con&s;iderable change in the nature of property made it nece&s;&s;ary to publi&s;h the new regulations con|tained in the <HI>Capitularia.</HI> Many of the&s;e as is evident from the peru&s;al of them, were general laws extend|ing to the whole French nation, in the general a&s;&s;em|bly in which they were enacted. The weakne&s;s of the greater part of the monarchs of the &s;econd race, and the di&s;order into which the nation was thrown by the depredations of the Normans, encouraged the
<PB N="308" REF="011837_0328_0F9D86BAF00F6BC8">
barons to u&s;urp an independent power formerly un|known in France. The nature and extent of that ju|ri&s;diction which they a&s;&s;umed, I have formerly con&s;i|dered. The political union of the kingdom was at an end, its ancient con&s;titution was di&s;&s;olved, and only a feudal relation &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the King and his va&s;&s;als. The regal juri&s;diction extended no further than the domains of the crown. Under the la&s;t Kings of the &s;econd race, the&s;e were reduced almo&s;t to no|thing. Under the fir&s;t Kings of the third race, they comprehended little more than the patrimonial e&s;tate of Hugh Capet, which he annexed to the crown. Even with this acce&s;&s;ion, they continued to be very narrow. Velly. Hi&s;t. de France, tom. iii. p. 32. Many of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable provinces of France did not at fir&s;t acknowledge Hugh Capet as a lawful Mo|narch. There are &s;till extant &s;everal charters, grant|ed during the fir&s;t years of his reign, with this re|markable clau&s;e in the form of dating the charter; "Deo regnante, rege expectante," regnante domino no&s;tro Je&s;u Chri&s;to, Francis autem contra jus regnum u&s;urpante Ugone rege. Bouquet Recueil. tom. x. p. 544. A Monarch who&s;e title was thus openly di&s;|puted, was not in a condition to a&s;&s;ert the royal juri&s;|diction, or to limit that of the barons.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e circum&s;tances rendered it ea&s;y for the barons to u&s;urp the rights of royalty within their own territories. The capitularia became no le&s;s ob&s;olete than the ancient laws; local cu&s;toms were every where introduced, and became the &s;ole rule by which all civil tran&s;actions were conducted, and all cau&s;es were tried. The wonderful ignorance, which became ge|neral in France, during the ninth and tenth centuries, contributed to the introduction of cu&s;tomary law. Few per&s;ons, except eccle&s;ia&s;tics, could read; and as it was not po&s;&s;ible for them to have recour&s;e to written laws, either as their guide in bu&s;ine&s;s, or their rule in admini&s;tring ju&s;tice, the cu&s;tomary law uni|ver&s;ally prevailed.</P>
<P>DURING this period, the general a&s;&s;embly of the nation &s;eems not to have been called, nor to have once exerted its legi&s;lative authority. Local cu&s;toms regu|lated
<PB N="309" REF="011837_0329_0F9D86BBAFA386B0">
and decided every thing. A &s;triking proof of this occurs in tracing the progre&s;s of the French juri&s;|prudence. The la&s;t of the Capitularia collected by M. Baluze, was i&s;&s;ued in the year 921, by Charles the Simple. An hundred and thirty years elap&s;ed from that period to the publication of the fir&s;t ordonance of the Kings of the third race, contained in the great collection of M. Lauriere, and the fir&s;t ordonance which appears to be an act of legi&s;lation extending to the whole kingdom is that of Philip Augu&s;tus, A. D. 1190. Ordon. tom. i. p. 1, 18. During that long period of one hundred and &s;ixty-nine years, all tran&s;|actions were directed by local cu&s;toms, and no addi|tion was made to the &s;tatutory law of France. The ordonances, previous to the reign of Philip Augu&s;tus, contain regulations, the authority of which did not extend beyond the King's domains.</P>
<P>VARIOUS in&s;tances occur of the caution with which the King's of France ventured at fir&s;t to exerci&s;e le|gi&s;lative authority. M. l'Ab. de Mably produces an ordonance of Philip Augu&s;tus, A. D. 1206, con|cerning the Jews, who, in that age, were in &s;ome mea&s;ure the property of the lord in who&s;e territories they re&s;ided. But it is not &s;o much an act of royal power, as a treaty of the King with the counte&s;s of Champagne, and the comte de Dampierre; and the regulations in it &s;eem to be e&s;tabli&s;hed not by his au|thority, but by their con&s;ent. Ob&s;ervat. &s;ur l'hi&s;t. de France, ii. p. 355. In the &s;ame manner an ordo|nance of Louis VIII. concerning the jews, A. D 1223, is a contract between the King and his nobles, with re&s;pect to their manner of treating that unhappy race of men. Ordon. tom. i. p. 47. The E&s;tabli&s;&s;e|mens of St. Louis, though well adapted to &s;erve as general laws to the whole kingdom, were not publi&s;h|ed as &s;uch, but only as a complete code of cu&s;tomary law, to be of authority within the King's domains The wi&s;dom, the equity and the order con&s;picuous in that code of St. Louis, procured it a favourable re|ception throughout the kingdom. The veneration due to the virtues and good intentions of its author, contributed not a little to reconcile the nation to that
<PB N="310" REF="011837_0330_0F9D86BC71A9F958">
legi&s;lative authority, which the King began to a&s;&s;ume. Soon after his time, the idea of the King's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;upreme legi&s;lative power became common. If, &s;ays Beaumanoir, the King makes any e&s;tabli&s;hment &s;pecially for his own domain, the barons may neverthele&s;s ad|here to their ancient cu&s;toms; but if the e&s;tabli&s;hment be general, it &s;hall be current throughout the king|dom, and we ought to believe that &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hments are made with mature deliberation, and for the gene|ral good. Count de Beauvoi&s;is, c. 48. p. 265. Though the Kings of the third race did not call the general a&s;&s;embly of the nation, during the long period from Hugh Capet to Philip the fair, yet they &s;eem to have con&s;ulted the bi&s;hops and barons who happened to be pre&s;ent in their court, with re&s;pect to any new law which they publi&s;hed. Examples of this occur Ordon. tom. i. p. 3 &amp; 5. The practice &s;eems to have continued as late as the reign of St. Louis, when the legi&s;lative authority of the crown was well e&s;tabli&s;hed. Ordon. tom. 1. p. 58. A. D. 1246. This attention paid to the barons facilitated the King's acquiring &s;uch full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the legi&s;lative power, as enabled them afterwards to exerci&s;e it without ob|&s;erving that formality.</P>
<P>THE a&s;&s;emblies, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of the States General, were fir&s;t called, A. D. 1302, and were held occa&s;ionally from that period to the year 1614, &s;ince which time they have not been &s;ummon|ed. The&s;e were very different from the ancient a&s;|&s;emblies of the French nation under the Kings of the fir&s;t and &s;econd race. There is no point with re&s;pect to which the French antiquarians are more generally agreed, than in maintaining that the States General had no &s;uffrage in the pa&s;&s;ing of laws, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no proper juri&s;diction. The whole tenor of the French hi&s;tory confirms this opinion. The form of proceeding in the States General was this. The King addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the whole body a&s;&s;embled in one place, and laid before them the affairs on account of which he had &s;ummoned them. The deputies of each <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the three orders, of nobles, of clergy, and of the third e&s;tate, met apart, and prepared their <HI>cahier</HI> or

memorial, containing their an&s;wer to the propo&s;iti|ons which had been made to them, together with the repre&s;entations which they thought proper to lay be|fore the King. The&s;e an&s;wers and repre&s;entations were con&s;idered by the King in his council, and ge|nerally gave ri&s;e to an ordonance. The&s;e ordonances were not addre&s;&s;ed to the three e&s;tates in common. Sometimes the King addre&s;&s;ed an ordonance to each of the e&s;tates in particular. Sometimes he mentioned the a&s;&s;embly of the three e&s;tates. Sometimes mention is made only of the a&s;&s;embly of that e&s;tate to which the ordonance is addre&s;&s;ed. Sometimes no mention at all is made of the a&s;&s;embly of e&s;tates, which &s;ugge&s;ted the propriety of enacting the law. Preface au tom. iii. des Ordon. p. xx. Thus the States General had only the privilege of advi&s;ing and remon&s;trating; the le|gi&s;lative authority re&s;ided in the King alone.</P>

<P>IF the parliament of Paris be con&s;idered only as the &s;upreme court of ju&s;tice, every thing relative to its origin and juri&s;diction is clear and obvious. It is the ancient court of the King's palace, new-modelled, rendered &s;edentary, and inve&s;ted with an exten&s;ive and a&s;certained juri&s;diction. The power of this court, while employed in this part of its functions, is not the object of pre&s;ent con&s;ideration. The preten&s;ions of the parliament to controul the exerci&s;e of the legi|&s;lative authority, and its claim of a right to interpo&s;e with re&s;pect to publick affairs and the political admi|ni&s;tration of the kingdom, lead to enquiries attended with greater difficulty. As the officers and members of the parliament of Paris were antiently nominated by the King, were paid by him, and on &s;everal occa|&s;ions were removed by him at plea&s;ure (Chroniq. Scan|deleu&s;e de Louis XI. chez les Mem. de Comines, tom. ii. p. 51. Edit. de M. Lenglet de Fre&s;noy), they can|not be con&s;idered as repre&s;entatives of the people, nor could they claim any &s;hare in the legi&s;lative power as acting in their name. We mu&s;t &s;earch for &s;ome other &s;ource of this high privilege. The parliament was origi|nally
<PB N="312" REF="011837_0332_0F9D86BE111F2208">
compo&s;ed of the mo&s;t eminent per&s;ons in the king|dom. The peers of France, eccle&s;ia&s;ticks of the high|e&s;t order, and noblemen of illu&s;trious birth were mem|bers of it, to whom were added &s;ome clerks and con|&s;ellors learned in the laws. Pa&s;quier Recherches, p. 44, &amp;c. Encyclopedie, tom. xii. Art&punc; <HI>Parlement,</HI> p. 3, 5. A court thus con&s;tituted, was properly a committee of the States General of the Kingdom, and was compo&s;ed of the&s;e barons and <HI>fideles,</HI> whom the Kings of France were accu&s;tomed to con&s;ult with re|gard to every act of juri&s;diction or legi&s;lative autho|rity. It was natural, therefore, during the intervals between the meetings of the States General, or during tho&s;e periods when that a&s;&s;embly was not called, to con&s;ult the parliament, to lay matters of publick con|cern before it, and to obtain its approbation and con|currence, before any ordonance was publi&s;hed, to which the people were required to conform. 2. Un|der the &s;econd race of Kings, every new law was re|duced into proper form by the Chancellor of the king|dom, was propo&s;ed by him to the people, and when enacted, was committed to him to be kept among the publick records, that he might give authentick copies of it to all who &s;hould demand them. Hincm. de ord. palat. c. 16. Capitul. Car. Calv. tit. xiv. &sect; 11. tit. xxxiii. The Chancellor pre&s;ided in the parliament of Paris at its fir&s;t in&s;titution.

It was therefore natural for the King to continue to employ him in his ancient functi|ons of framing, taking into his cu&s;tody, and publi&s;h|ing the ordonances which were i&s;&s;ued. To an ancient copy of the Capitularia of Charlemagne, the following words are &s;ubjoined. Anno tertio Clementi&s;&s;imi do|mini no&s;tri Caroli Augu&s;ti, &s;ub ip&s;o anno, haec facta Capitula &s;unt, &amp; con&s;ignata Stephano comiti, ut haec manife&s;ta faceret Pari&s;iis mallo publico, &amp; illa legere faceret coram Scabineis, quod ita &amp; fecit, &amp; omnes in uno con&s;en&s;erunt, quod ip&s;i volui&s;&s;ent ob&s;ervare u&s;que in po&s;terum, etiam omnes Scabinei, Epi&s;copi, Abbates, Comites, manu propria &s;ubter &s;ignaverunt. Bouquet Recueil. tom. v. p. 663. <HI>Mallus</HI> &s;ignifies not only the publick a&s;&s;embly of the nation, but the court of ju&s;tice

held by the comes, or mi&s;&s;us dominicus. Scabini were the judges, or the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the judges in that court. Here then &s;eems to be a very early in&s;tance, not only of laws being publi&s;hed in a court of ju&s;tice, but of their being verified or confirmed by the &s;ub|&s;cription of the judges. If this was the common prac|tice, it naturally introduced the verifying of edicts in the parliament of Paris. But this conjecture I pro|po&s;e with that diffidence, which I felt in all my rea|&s;onings concerning the laws and in&s;titutions of foreign nations. 3. This &s;upreme court of ju&s;tice in France was dignified with the appellation of parliament, the name by which the general a&s;&s;embly of the nation was di&s;tingui&s;hed towards the clo&s;e of the &s;econd race of Kings; and men, both in rea&s;oning and in conduct, are wonderfully influenced by the &s;imilarity of names. The pre&s;erving the ancient names of the magi&s;trates, e&s;tabli&s;hed while republican government &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in Rome, enabled Augu&s;tus and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to a&s;&s;ume new powers, with le&s;s ob&s;ervation, and greater ea&s;e. The be&s;towing the &s;ame name in France upon two courts, which were extremely different, contributed not a little to confound their juri&s;diction and functions.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e circum&s;tances concurred in leading the Kings of France to avail them&s;elves of the parliament of Paris, as the in&s;trument of reconciling the people to their exerci&s;e of legi&s;lative authority. The French, accu&s;tomed to &s;ee all new laws examined and autho|rized before they were publi&s;hed, did not &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;h between the effect of performing this in the national a&s;&s;embly, or in a court appointed by the King. But as that court was compo&s;ed of re&s;pectable members, and well &s;killed in the laws of their coun|try, when any new edict received its &s;anction, that was &s;ufficient to di&s;po&s;e the people to implicit &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>WHEN the practice of <HI>verifying</HI> and <HI>regi&s;tering</HI> the royal edicts in the parliament of Paris became com|mon, the parliament contended, that this was nece&s;&s;ary in order to give them legal authority. It was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed as a fundamental maxim in French juri&s;pru|dence, that no law could be publi&s;hed in any other
<PB N="314" REF="011837_0334_0F9D86C0306E0A70">
manner; that without this formality, no edict or or|donance could have any effect; that the people were not bound to obey it, and ought not to con&s;ider it as an edict or ordonance until it was verified in the &s;upreme court, after free deliberation. Roche-flavin des Par|lemens de France, 4to. Gen. 1621. p. 921. The par|liament, at different times, hath with great fortitude and integrity, oppo&s;ed the will of their &s;overeigns, and notwith&s;tanding their repeated and peremptory requi&s;itions and commands, hath refu&s;ed to verify and publi&s;h &s;uch edicts, as it conceived to be oppre&s;|&s;ive to the people, or &s;ubver&s;ive of the con&s;titution of the kingdom. Roche-flavin reckons that between the year 1562, and the year 1589, the parliament refu&s;ed to verify more than a hundred edicts of the Kings. Ibid. 924. Many in&s;tances of the &s;pirit and con&s;tan|cy, with which the parliaments of France oppo&s;ed pernicious laws, and a&s;&s;erted their own privileges, are enumerated by Limnaeus Notitiae Regni Franciae, lib. i. c. 9. p. 224.</P>
<P>BUT the power of the parliament to maintain and defend this privilege, bore no proportion to its im|portance, or to the courage with which its members a&s;&s;erted it. When any monarch was determined that an edict &s;hould be carried into execution, and found the parliament inflexibly re&s;olved not to verify or pub|li&s;h it, he could ea&s;ily &s;upply this defect by the pleni|tude of his regal power. He repaired to the parlia|ment in per&s;on, he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his &s;eat of ju|&s;tice, and commanded the edict to be read, verified, regi&s;tered, and publi&s;hed in his pre&s;ence. Then, ac|cording to another maxim of French law, the King him&s;elf being pre&s;ent, neither the parliament, nor any magi&s;trate whatever, can exerci&s;e any authority, or perform any function.

Roche-flavin mentions &s;everal in&s;tances of Kings who actual|ly exerted this prerogative, &s;o fatal to the re&s;idue of the rights and liberties, tran&s;mitted to the French by their ance&s;tors. Pa&s;quier produces &s;ome in&s;tances of the &s;ame kind. Rech. p. 61. Limnaeus enumerates

<P N="1">1. WITH re&s;pect to the power, juri&s;diction and revenue of the Emperors. A very ju&s;t idea of the&s;e may be formed by attending to the view which Pfeffel gives of the rights of the Emperors at two different periods. The fir&s;t at the clo&s;e of the Saxon race, A. D. 1024. The&s;e, according to his enumeration were the right of conferring all the great eccle&s;ia&s;tical beni|fices in Germany; of receiving the revenues of them during a vacancy; of Mort-main, or of &s;ucceeding to the effects of eccle&s;ia&s;ticks who died inte&s;tate. The right of confirming or of annulling the elections of the Popes. The right of a&s;&s;embling councils, and of ap|pointing them to decide concerning the affairs of the church. The right of conferring the title of King upon their va&s;&s;als. The right of granting vacant fiefs. The right of receiving the revenues of the Empire, whether ari&s;ing from the Imperial domains, from im|po&s;ts and tolls, from gold or &s;ilver mines, from the taxes paid by the Jews, or from forfeitures. The right of governing Italy as its proper &s;overeigns. The right of erecting free cities, and of e&s;tabli&s;hing fairs in them. The right of a&s;&s;embling the diets of the Em|pire, and of fixing the time of their duration. The right of coining money, and of conferring that privi|lege on the &s;tates of the Empire. The right of admi|ni&s;tring both high and low ju&s;tice within the territo|ries of the different &s;tates. Abreg&eacute; p. 160. The other period is at the extinction of the Emperors of the families of Luxemburg, and Bavaria, A. D. 1437. According to the &s;ame author the Imperial preroga|tives at that time were the right of conferring all dig|nities and titles, except the privilege of being a &s;tate of the Empire. The right of <HI>Precis primariae</HI> or of ap|pointing once during their reign a dignitary in each chapter or religious hou&s;e. The right of granting di&s;|pen&s;ations with re&s;pect to the age of majority. The right of erecting cities, and of conferring the privilege of coining money. The right of calling the meetings of the diet, and of pre&s;iding in them. Abreg&eacute;, &amp;c.

p. 507. It were ea&s;y to &s;how that M. Pfeffel is well founded in all the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions, and to confirm them by the te&s;timony of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable authors. In the one period the Emperors appear as mighty &s;overeigns with exten&s;ive prerogatives; in the other as the heads of a confederacy with very limited powers.</P>
<P>THE revenues of the Emperors decrea&s;ed &s;till more than their authority. The early Emperors, and par|ticularly tho&s;e of the Saxon line, be&s;ides their va&s;t pa|trimonial or hereditary territories, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an ex|ten&s;ive domain both in Italy and Germany which be|longed to them as Emperors. Italy belonged to the Emperors as their proper kingdom, and the revenues which they drew from it were very con&s;iderable. The fir&s;t alienations of the Imperial revenue were made in this country. The Italian cities having acquired wealth, and a&s;piring at independance, purcha&s;ed their liberty from different Emperors, as I have ob&s;erved Note XV. The &s;ums which they paid, and the Emperors with whom they concluded the&s;e bargains, are mentioned by Ca&s;p. Klockius de Aerario Norimb. 1671. p. 85, &amp;c. Charles IV. and his &s;on Wence&s;laus di&s;&s;ipated all that remained of the Italian branch of the domain. The German domain lay chiefly upon the banks of the Rhine, and was under the government of the Counts Palatine. It is not ea&s;y to mark out the bound|aries, or to e&s;timate the value of this ancient domain, which has been &s;o long incorporated with the terri|tories of different Princes. Some hints with re&s;pect to it may be found in the glo&s;&s;ary of Speidelius which he has intitled Speculum Juridico-Philologico-politico-Hi&s;toricum Ob&s;ervationum, &amp;c. Norimb. 1673. vol. i. 679. 1045. a more full account of it is given by Klockius de Aerario, p. 84. Be&s;ides this, the Empe|rors po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed con&s;iderable di&s;tricts of land lying inter|mixed with the e&s;tates of the Dukes and barons. They were accu&s;tomed to vi&s;it the&s;e frequently, and drew from them what was &s;ufficient to &s;upport their court during the time of their re&s;idence. Annali&s;tae, ap. Struv. tom. i. 611.

the Emperors and the court of Rome. At the &s;ame time that &s;uch encroachments were made on the fixed or territorial property of the Emperors, they were robbed almo&s;t entirely of their ca&s;ual revenues. The Princes and barons appropriating to them&s;elves taxes and duties of every kind, which had u&s;ually been paid to them, Pfeffel Abreg&egrave;, p. 374. The profu&s;e and inconfiderate ambition of Charles IV. &s;quandered what|ever remained of the Imperial revenues after &s;o many defalcations. He, in the year 1376, in order to pre|vail with the electors to chu&s;e his &s;on Wence&s;laus King of the Romans, promi&s;ed each of them a hun|dred thou&s;and crowns. But being unable to pay &s;o large a &s;um, and eager to &s;ecure the election to his &s;on, he alienated to the three eccle&s;ia&s;tical Electors, and to the Count Palatine, &s;uch countries as &s;till belonged to the Imperial domain on the banks of the Rhine, and likewi&s;e made over to them all the taxes and tolls then levied by the Emperors in that di&s;trict. Trithemius, and the author of the Chronicle of Magdeburgh enume|rate the territories and taxes which were thus alienated, and repre&s;ent this as the la&s;t and fatal blow to the Im|perial authority. Struv. Corp. vol. i. p. 437. From that period, the &s;hreds of the ancient revenues po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed by the Emperors have been &s;o incon&s;iderable, that in the opinion of Speidelius, all that they yield would be &s;o far from defraying the expence of &s;upporting their hou&s;hold, that they would not pay the charge of maintaining the po&s;ts e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Empire.

<P N="2"><PB N="319" REF="011837_0339_0F9D86C3F0978B70">2. THE ancient mode of electing the Emperors, and the various changes which it underwent, require &s;ome illu&s;tration. The Imperial crown, as well as tho&s;e of mo&s;t monarchies in Europe, were originally attained by election. An opinion long prevailed among the antiquaries and publick lawyers of Germa|ny, that the right of chu&s;ing the Emperors was ve&s;ted in the archbi&s;hops of Mentz, Cologne and Treves, the King of Bohemia, the Duke of Saxony, the Marquis of Brandenburgh, and the Count Palatine of the Rhine, by an edict of Otho III, confirmed by Grego|ry the V, about the year 996. But the whole tenor of hi&s;tory contradicts this opinion. It appears that from the earlie&s;t period in the hi&s;tory of Germany, the per|&s;on who was to reign over all, was elected by the &s;uf|rage of all. Thus Conrad I. was elected by all the people of the Franks, &s;ays &s;ome annali&s;ts; by all the princes and chief men, &s;ays others; by all the nation, &s;ays others. See their words, Struv. Corp. 211. Con|ringius de German. Imper. Repub. Acroamata Sex. Ebroduni 1654. p. 103. In the year 1024, po&s;terior to the &s;uppo&s;ed regulations of Otho III, Conrad II, was elected by all the chief men, and his election was approved and confirmed by the people, Struv. Corp. 284. At the election of Lotharius II, A. D. 1125, &s;ixty thou&s;and per&s;ons of all ranks were pre&s;ent. He was named by the chief men, and their nomination was approved by the people. Struv. ibid. p. 357. The fir&s;t author who mentions the &s;even Electors is Martinus Polonus, who flouri&s;hed in the reign of Frederick II, which ended A. D. 1250. We find that in all the ancient elections to which I have refer|red, the Princes of greate&s;t power and authority were allowed by their countrymen to name the per&s;on whom they wi&s;hed to appoint Emperor, and the people approv|ed or di&s;approved of their nomination. This privilege of voting fir&s;t is called by the German lawyers the right of <HI>Praetaxation.</HI> Pfeffel Abreg&eacute;, p. 316. This was the fir&s;t origin of the exclu&s;ive right which the Electors acquired. The Electors po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t exten&s;ive territories of any Princes in the Empire; all the great offices of the &s;tate were in their hands by he|reditary
<PB N="320" REF="011837_0340_0F9D86C4AF8D1498">
right; as &s;oon as they obtained or engro&s;&s;ed &s;o much influence in the election, as to be allowed the right of praetaxation, it became unnece&s;&s;ary for the in|ferior eccle&s;ia&s;ticks and barons to attend, when they had no other function but that of confirming the deed of the&s;e more powerful Princes, by their a&s;&s;ent. Dur|ing times of turbulence, they could not re&s;ort to the place of election, without a numerous retinue of arm|ed va&s;&s;als, the expence of which they were obliged to defray out of their own revenues. The rights of the &s;even Electors were &s;upported by all the de&s;cendants and allies of their powerful families, who &s;hared in the &s;plendor and influence, which they enjoyed by this di&s;tingui&s;hing privilege. Pfeffel. Abreg&eacute;, p. 376. The &s;even Electors were con&s;idered as the repre&s;entatives of all the orders, which compo&s;ed the highe&s;t cla&s;s of German nobility. There were three archbi&s;hops, chancellors of the three great di&s;tricts into which the Empire was anciently divided; one King; one Duke; one Marquis; and one Count. All the&s;e circum&s;tan|ces contributed to render the introduction of this con|&s;iderable innovation into the con&s;titution of the Ger|manick body, extremely ea&s;y. Every thing of impor|tance, relating to this branch of the political &s;tate of the Empire, is well illu&s;trated by Onuphrius Panvi|nius an Augu&s;tinian Monk of Verona, who lived in the reign of Charles V. His treati&s;e, if we make &s;ome allowance for that partiality which he expre&s;&s;es in fa|vour of the powers which the Popes claimed in the Empire has the merit of being one of the fir&s;t works in which a controverted point in hi&s;tory is examined with critical preci&s;ion, and with a proper attention to that evidence which is derived from records, or the te&s;timony of contemporary hi&s;torians. It is in&s;erted by Golda&s;tus in his Politica Imperialia, p. 2.</P>
<P>AS the Electors have engro&s;&s;ed the &s;ole right of chu&s;ing the Emperors, they have a&s;&s;umed likewi&s;e that of depo&s;ing them. This high power the Electors have not only pre&s;umed to claim, but have ventured, in more than one in&s;tance, to exerci&s;e. In the year 1298, a part of the Electors de&s;po&s;ed Adolphus of Na&s;&s;au and &s;ub&s;tituted Albert of Au&s;tria in his place.

WITH re&s;pect to the diets or general a&s;&s;emblies of the Empire, it would be nece&s;&s;ary, if my object were to write a particular hi&s;tory of Germany, to enter in|to a minute detail, concerning the forms of a&s;&s;embling it, the per&s;ons who have a right to be pre&s;ent, their divi&s;ion into &s;everal Colleges or Benches, the objects of their deliberations, the mode in which they carry on their debates or give their &s;uffrages, and the au|thority of their decrees or rece&s;&s;es. But in a general hi&s;tory it is &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that, originally, the diets of the Empire were perfectly the &s;ame with the a&s;|&s;emblies of March and of May, held by the Kings of France. They met, at lea&s;t, once a year. Every freeman had a right to be pre&s;ent. They were a&s;&s;em|blies in which a monarch deliberated with his &s;ubjects, concerning their common intere&s;t. Arumaeus de comitiis Rom. German Imperii, 4to. Jenae. 1660, cap. 7. No. 20, &amp;c. But when the Princes, dig|nified eccle&s;ia&s;ticks, and barons, acquired territorial and independant juri&s;diction, the diet became an a&s;|&s;embly of the &s;eparate &s;tates, which formed the con|federacy of which the Emperor was head. While the con&s;titution of the Empire remained in its primitive form, attendance on the diets was a duty, like the other &s;ervices due from feudal &s;ubjects to their &s;ove|reign, which the members were bound to perform in per&s;on; and if any member who had a right to be

pre&s;ent in the diet neglected to attend in per&s;on, he not only lo&s;t his vote, but was liable to an heavy pen|alty. Arumaeus de Comit. c. 5. No. 40. Whereas, from the time that the members of the diet became independant &s;tates, the right of &s;uffrage was annexed to the territory or dignity, not to the per&s;on. The members, if they could not, or would not attend in per&s;on, might &s;end their deputies, as Princes &s;end amba&s;&s;adors, and they were entitled to exerci&s;e all the rights belonging to their con&s;titutients. Ibid. No. 42, 46, 49. By degrees, and upon the &s;ame princi|ple of con&s;idering the diet as an a&s;&s;embly of independ|ant &s;tates, in which each confederate had the right of &s;uffrage, if any member po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more than one of tho&s;e &s;tates or characters which entitle to a &s;eat in the diet, he was allowed a proportional number of &s;uffra|ges. Pfeffel, Abreg&eacute; 622. From the &s;ame cau&s;e the Imperial cities, as &s;oon as they became free, and acquired &s;upreme and independant juri&s;diction within their own territories, were received as members of the diet. The powers of the diet extend to every thing relative to the common concern of the Germanick bo|dy, or that can intere&s;t or affect it as a confederacy. The diet takes no cognizance of the interior admini|&s;tration in the different States, unle&s;s that happens to di&s;turb or threaten the general &s;afety.</P>
<P N="4">4. WITH re&s;pect to the Imperial chamber, the ju|ri&s;diction of which has been the great &s;ource of order and tranquillity in Germany, it is nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that this court was in&s;tituted in order to put an end to the calamities occa&s;ioned by private wars in Germa|ny. I have already traced the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of this practice, and pointed out its pernicious effects as fully as their exten&s;ive influence during the middle ages merited. In Germany, private wars &s;eem to have been more frequent and productive of wor&s;e con|&s;equences than in the other countries of Europe. There are obvious rea&s;ons for this. The nobility of Germany were extremely numerous, and the cau&s;es of their di&s;&s;ention multiplied in proportion. The territorial juri&s;diction which the German nobles ac|quired, was more compleat than that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by
<PB N="323" REF="011837_0343_0F9D86C7C47966A8">
their order in other nations. They became, in reali|ty, independent powers, and they claimed all the pri|vileges of that character. The long interregnum ac|cu&s;tomed them to an uncontrouled licence, and led them to forget that &s;ubordination which is nece&s;&s;ary in order to maintain public tranquillity. At the time when the other monarchs of Europe began to acquire &s;uch an increa&s;e of power and revenues, as added new force to their government, the authority and reve|nues of the Emperors continued gradually to decline. The diets of the Empire, which alone had autho|rity to judge between &s;uch mighty barons, and pow|er to enforce its deci&s;ions, met very &s;eldom. Con|ring. Acroamata, p. 234. The diets when they did a&s;&s;emble were often compo&s;ed of &s;everal thou&s;and members, Chronic, Con&s;tant. ap. Struv. Corp. i. p. 546, and were mere tumultuary a&s;&s;emblies, ill-quali|fied to decide concerning any que&s;tion of right. The &s;e&s;&s;ion of the diets continued only two or three days; Pfeffel Abreg&egrave;, p. 244, &s;o that they had no time to hear or di&s;cu&s;s any cau&s;e that was in the &s;malle&s;t de|gree intricate. Thus Germany was left, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, without any court of judicature, capable of repre&s;&s;ing the evils of private war.</P>
<P>ALL the expedients which were employed in other countries of Europe in order to re&s;train this practice, and which I have de&s;cribed Note XXI. were tried in Germany with little effect. The confederacies of the nobles and of the cities, and the divi&s;ion of Germany in|to various circles, which I mentioned in that Note, were found likewi&s;e in&s;ufficient. As a la&s;t remedy, the Germans had recour&s;e to arbiters whom they call|ed <HI>Au&s;tregae.</HI> The barons and &s;tates in different parts of Germany joined in conventions, by which they bound them&s;elves to refer all controver&s;ies, that might ari&s;e between them, to the determination of <HI>Au&s;tregae,</HI> and to &s;ubmit to their &s;entences as final. The&s;e arbi|ters are named &s;ometimes in the treaty of convention, an in&s;tance of which occurs in Ludewig Reliquae Ma|nu&s;cr. omnis aevi, vol. 2. 212. &s;ometimes they were cho&s;en by mutual con&s;ent; &s;ometimes they were ap|pointed by neutral per&s;ons; and &s;ometimes the choice

was left to be decided by lot. Datt. de Pace publi|ca Imperii, lib. i. cap. 27. N^o 60, &amp;c. Speidelius Speculum, &amp;c. voc. <HI>Au&s;treg.</HI> p. 95. Upon the in|troduction of this practice, the public tribunals of ju&s;|tice became, in a great mea&s;ure, u&s;ele&s;s, and were al|mo&s;t entirely de&s;erted.</P>
<P>IN order to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the authority of govern|ment, Maximilian in&s;tituted the Imperial chamber, at the period which I have mentioned. This tribunal con&s;i&s;ted originally of a pre&s;ident, who was always a nobleman of the fir&s;t order, and of &s;ixteen judges. The pre&s;ident was appointed by the Emperor, and the judges, partly by him, and partly by the States, ac|cording to forms which it is unnece&s;&s;ary to de&s;cribe. A &s;um was impo&s;ed with their own con&s;ent, on the States of the Empire, for paying the &s;alaries of the judges, and officers in this court. The Imperial chamber was e&s;tabli&s;hed fir&s;t at Francfort on the Maine. During the reign of Charles V. it was removed to Spires, and continued in that city above a century and a half. It is now fixed at Wetzlar. This court takes cognizance of all que&s;tions concerning civil right between the States of the Empire, and pa&s;&s;es judg|ment in the la&s;t re&s;ort, and without appeal. To it belongs, likewi&s;e, the privilege of judging in criminal cau&s;es, which may be con&s;idered as connected with the pre&s;ervation of the publick peace. Pfeffel Abreg&eacute;, 560.</P>
<P>ALL cau&s;es relating to points of feudal right or juri&s;diction, together with &s;uch as re&s;pect the territo|ries, which hold of the Empire in Italy, belong pro|perly to the juri&s;diction of the Aulick council. This tribunal was formed upon tihe model of the ancient court of the palace in&s;tituted by the Emperors of Ger|many. It depended not upon the States of the Em|pire, but upon the Emperor; he having the right of appointing at plea&s;ure all the judges of whom it is compo&s;ed. Maximilian, in order to procure &s;ome compen&s;ation for the diminution of his authority, by the powers ve&s;ted in the Imperial chamber, prevailed on the diet A. D. 1512. to give its con&s;ent to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Aulick council. Since that time,
<PB N="325" REF="011837_0345_0F9D86C883584320">
it has been a great object of policy in the court of Vi|enna to extend the juri&s;diction, and &s;upport the au|thority of the Aulick council, and to circum&s;cribe and weaken tho&s;e of the Imperial chamber. The te|dious forms and dilatory proceeding of the Imperial chamber have furni&s;hed the Emperors with pretexts for doing &s;o. Lites Spirae, according to the wittici&s;m of a German lawyer, &s;pirant, &s;ed nunquam ex&s;pirant. Such delays are unavoidable in a court compo&s;ed of members named by States, jealous of each other. Whereas the judges of the Aulick council, depending on one ma&s;ter, and being re&s;pon&s;ible to him alone, are more vigorous and deci&s;ive. Puffendorf. de Statu Imper. German. cap. v. &sect; 20.

<P>THE de&s;cription which I have given of the Turki&s;h government is conformable to the accounts of the mo&s;t intelligent travellers who have vi&s;ited that Empire. The count de Mar&s;igli, in his trea|ti&s;e concerning the military &s;tate of the Turki&s;h Empire, ch. vi. and the Author of ob&s;ervations on the religion, laws, government and manners of the Turks, publi&s;hed at London 1768, vol i. p. 81. differ from other writers who have de&s;cribed the political con&s;titu|tion of that powerful monarchy. As they had opportunity, dur|ing their long re&s;idence in Turky, to ob&s;erve the order and ju&s;tice con&s;picuous in &s;everal departments of admini&s;tration, they &s;eem unwilling to admit that it &s;hould be denominated a de&s;poti&s;m. But when the form of government in any country is repre&s;ented to be de&s;potick, this does not &s;uppo&s;e that the power of the monarch is continually exerted in acts of violence, inju&s;tice and cruelty. Under government of every &s;pecies, unle&s;s when &s;ome frantick tyrant hap|pens to hold the &s;cepter, the ordinary admini&s;tration mu&s;t be con|formable to the principles of ju&s;tice, and if not active in promoting the welfare of the people, cannot certainly have their de&s;truction for its object. A &s;tate, in which the &s;overeign po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the ab&s;o|lute command of a va&s;t military force, together with the di&s;po&s;al of an exten&s;ive revenue; in which the people have no privileges, and no part eitheir immediate or remote in legi&s;lation; in which there is no body of hereditary nobility, jealous of their own rights and di&s;tinctions, to &s;tand as an intermediate order between the Prince and People, cannot be di&s;tingui&s;hed by any name but that of a de&s;poti&s;m. The re&s;traints, however, which I have mention|ed ari&s;ing from the <HI>Capiculy,</HI> and from religion, are powerful.

Count Mar&s;igli and Sir Paul Rycaut have been extracts from this book of regulations, and it appears that the ordinary e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Turki&s;h army exceeded an hundred and fifty thou&s;and men. When the&s;e are added to the &s;oldiery of the Porte, they formed a military power which va&s;tly exceeded what any Chri&s;tian State could command. Mar&s;igli Etat Militaire, &amp;c. p. 136. Rycaut's &s;tate of the Ottoman Empire, book iii. ch. 2. As Solyman, dur|ing his active reign, was engaged &s;o con&s;tantly in war, that his troops were always in the field, the <HI>Serrataculy</HI> became almo&s;t equal to the Janizaries them&s;elves in di&s;cipline and valour.</P>
<P>IT is not &s;urprizing, then, that the authors of the &s;ixteenth century &s;hould repre&s;ent the Turks as far &s;uperior to the Chri&s;tians, both in the knowledge and in the practice of the art of war. Gu|icciardini informs us, that the Italians learned the art of fortifying towns from the Turks. Hi&s;tor. lib. xv. p. 266. Bu&s;bequius, who was amba&s;&s;ador from Ferdinand to Solyman, and who had oppor|tunity to ob&s;erve the &s;tate both of the Chri&s;tian and Turki&s;h ar|mies, publi&s;hed a di&s;cour&s;e concerning the be&s;t manner of carrying on war again&s;t the Turks, in which he points out at great length the immen&s;e advantages which the infidels po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with re&s;pect to di&s;|cipline, and military improvements of every kind. Bu&s;bequii opera edit. Elzevir. p. 393, &amp;c. The Te&s;timony of other authors might be added, if the matter were, in any degree, doubtful.</P>
<P>BEFORE I conclude the&s;e Proofs and Illu&s;trations, I ought to explain the rea&s;on of two omi&s;&s;ions in them; one of which it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to mention on my own account, the other to obviate an ob|jection to this part of the work.</P>
<P>IN all my inquiries and di&s;qui&s;itions concerning the progre&s;s of government, manners, literature, and commerce during the mid|dle ages, as well as in my delineations of the political con&s;titution of the different States of Europe at the opening of the &s;ixteenth century, I have not once mentioned M. de Voltaire, who, in his <HI>E&s;&s;ay &s;ur l'hi&s;toire generale,</HI> has reveiwed the &s;ame period, and has treated of all the&s;e &s;ubjects. This does not proceed from inattenti|on to the works of that extraordinary man, who&s;e genius, no le&s;s enterprizing than univer&s;al, has attempted almo&s;t every different &s;pecies of literary compo&s;ition. In many of the&s;e he excels, In all if he had left religion untouched, he is in&s;tructive and agreeable. But as he &s;eldom imitates the example of modern hi&s;torians in cit|ing the authors from whom they derived their information. I could not, with propriety, appeal to his authority in confirmation of any doubtful or unknown fact. I have often, however, follow|ed him as my guide in the&s;e re&s;earches; and he has not only point|ed out the facts with re&s;pect to which it was of importance to in|quire, but the conclu&s;ions which it was proper to draw from them. If he had, at the &s;ame time, mentioned the books which relate the&s;e particulars, a great part of my labour would have been un|nece&s;&s;ary,
<PB N="328" REF="011837_0348_0F9D86CAB0168818">
and many of his readers who now con&s;ider him only as an entertaining and lively writer, would find that he is a learned and well-informed hi&s;torian.</P>
<P>AS to the other omi&s;&s;ion; every intelligent reader mu&s;t have ob&s;erved, that I have not entered, either in the hi&s;torical part of this volume, or in the Proofs and Illu&s;trations, into the &s;ame de|tail with re&s;pect to the ancient laws and cu&s;toms of the Briti&s;h king|doms, as concerning tho&s;e of the other European nations. As the capital facts with regard to the progre&s;s of government and man|ners in their own country are known to mo&s;t of my readers, &s;uch a detail appeared to me to be le&s;s e&s;&s;ential. Such facts and ob&s;er|vations, however, as were nece&s;&s;ary towards compleating my de&s;ign in this part of the work, I have mentioned under the different arti|cles which are the &s;ubjects of my di&s;qui&s;itions. The &s;tate of go|vernment, in all the nations of Europe, having been nearly the &s;ame during &s;everal ages, nothing can tend more to illu&s;trate the progre&s;s of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, than a careful inquiry into the laws and cu&s;toms of the kingdoms on the continent. This &s;ource of information has been too much neglected by the Engli&s;h antiquarians and lawyers. Filled with admiration of that happy con&s;titution now e&s;tabli&s;hed in Great Britain, they have been more attentive to its forms and principles, than to the condition and ideas of remote times, which, in almo&s;t every particular, differ from the pre&s;ent. While engaged in peru&s;ing the laws, charters, and early hi&s;torians of the continental kingdoms, I have often been led to think that an attempt to illu&s;trate the progre&s;s of the Engli&s;h juri&s;prudence and policy, by a compari&s;on with tho&s;e of other kingdoms in a &s;imilar &s;ituation, would be of great utility, and might throw much light on &s;ome points which are now ob&s;cure, and decide others, which have been long controverted.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE REIGN OF THE EMPEROR CHARLES V. BOOK I.</HEAD>
<P>CHARLES V. was born at Ghent&punc; on the twenty-fourth day of February,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Birth of Charles V.</NOTE> in the year one thou&s;and five hun|dred. His father, Philip the Hand&s;ome, Archduke of Au&s;tria, was the &s;on of the Emperor Maximilian, and of Mary, the only child of Charles the Bold, the la&s;t prince of the hou&s;e of Bur|gundy. His mother, Joanna, was the &s;econd daughter of Ferdinand and I&s;abella, king and queen of Ca&s;tile and Aragon.</P>
<P>A LONG train of fortunate events had opened the way for this young prince to the inheritance of more exten&s;ive dominions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His domi|nions, and the events by which he acquired them.</NOTE> than any Euro|pean monarch, &s;ince Charles the Great, had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Each of his ance&s;tors had ac|quired kingdoms or provinces, towards which their pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was extremely remote, The rich po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of Mary of Burgundy were de&s;tined for another family, &s;he having been contracted by her father to the only &s;on of Lewis XI. of France; but that capricious monarch, indulging his hatred to her fa|mily,

cho&s;e rather to &s;trip her of part of her territories by force, than to &s;ecure the whole by marriage; and by this mi&s;conduct, fatal to his po&s;terity, threw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Ne|therlands and Franche Comt&eacute; into the hands of a rival. I&s;abella, the daughter of John II. of Ca&s;tile, far from having any pro&s;pect of that noble inheritance, which &s;he tran&s;mitted to her grand&s;on, pa&s;&s;ed the early part of her life in ob&s;curity and indigence; but the Ca&s;tili|ans, exa&s;perated again&s;t her brother Henry IV. an ill-advi&s;ed and vicious prince, publicly charged him with impotence, and his queen with adultery; and, upon his demi&s;e, rejecting Joanna, whom the king had uniformly, and even on his death-bed, owned to be his lawful daughter, and whom an a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates had ac|knowledged to be the heir of his kingdom, they obliged her to retire into Portugal, and placed I&s;abella on the throne of Ca&s;tile. Ferdinand owed the crown of Ara|gon to the unexpected death of his elder brother, and acquired the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily by violat|ing the faith of treaties, and di&s;regarding the ties of blood. To all the&s;e kingdoms, Chri&s;topher Columbus, by an effort of genius and of intrepidity, the bolde&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful that is recorded in the annals of man|kind, added a new world, the wealth of which was one con&s;iderable &s;ource of the power and grandeur of the Spani&s;h monarchs.</P>
<P>DON John, the only &s;on of Ferdinand and I&s;abella, and their elde&s;t daughter, the queen of Por|tugal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philip and Joanna, his father and mother, vi|&s;it Spain.</NOTE> being cut off in the flower of youth, all their hopes centered in Joanna and her po&s;terity. But as her hu&s;band, the Archduke, was a &s;tranger to the Spaniards, it was thought expedient to invite him into Spain, that by re|&s;iding among them, he might accu&s;tom him&s;elf to their laws and manners; and it was expected that the Cortes, or a&s;&s;embly of &s;tates, who&s;e authority was then &s;o great in Spain, that no title to the crown was reckoned valid un|le&s;s it received their &s;anction, would acknowledge his right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, together with that of the Infanta, his wife.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1502.</NOTE> Philip and Joanna, pa&s;&s;ing through France, in their way to Spain, were en|tertained in that kingdom with the utmo&s;t magnifi|cence.

The archduke did homage to Lewis XII. for the earldom of Flanders, and took his &s;eat as a peer of the realm in the parliament of Paris. They were re|ceived in Spain with every mark of honour that the pa|rental affection of Ferdinand and I&s;abella, or the re&s;pect of their &s;ubjects could devi&s;e; and their title to the crown was &s;oon after acknowledged by the Cortes of both kingdoms.</P>
<P>BUT amid&s;t the&s;e outward appearances of &s;atisfaction and joy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ferdinand jealous of Philip's power.</NOTE> &s;ome &s;ecret unea&s;ine&s;s preyed upon the mind of each of the&s;e princes. The &s;tately and re&s;erved ceremonial of the Spa|ni&s;h court was &s;o burden&s;ome to Philip, a prince young, gay, affable, fond of &s;ociety and of plea|&s;ure, that he &s;oon began to expre&s;s a de&s;ire of returning to his native country, the manners of which were more &s;uited to his temper. Ferdinand, ob&s;erving the declin|ing health of his queen, with who&s;e life his right to the government of Ca&s;tile mu&s;t cea&s;e, ea&s;ily fore&s;aw, that a prince of Philip's di&s;po&s;ition, and who already di&s;co|vered an extreme impatience to reign, would never con|&s;ent to his retaining any degree of authority in that kingdom; and the pro&s;pect of this diminution of his power, awakened the jealou&s;y of that ambitious mo|narch.</P>
<P>ISABELLA beheld, with the &s;entiments natural to a mother,<NOTE PLACE="marg">I&s;abella's &s;olicitude, with re|&s;pect to him and her daugh|ter.</NOTE> the indifference and neglect with which the Archduke treated her daughter, who was de&s;titute of all tho&s;e beauties of per&s;on, and all tho&s;e accompli&s;hments of mind, which fix the affections of an hu&s;|band. Her under&s;tanding, always weak, was often di&s;ordered. She doated on Philip with &s;uch an exce&s;s of childi&s;h and impertinent fondne&s;s, as excited di&s;gu&s;t rather than affection. Her jealou&s;y, for which her hu&s;band's behaviour gave her too much cau&s;e, was proportioned to her love, and often broke out in the mo&s;t extravagant actions. I&s;abella, though &s;en&s;ible of her defects, could not help pitying her condition, which was &s;oon rendered altogether deplorable, by the arch|duke's abrupt re&s;olution of &s;etting out in the middle of winter for Flanders, and of leaving her in Spain.

intreated him not to abandon his wife to grief and melancholy, which might prove fatal to her, as &s;he was near the time of her delivery. Joanna conjured him to put off his journey for three days only, that &s;he might have the plea&s;ure of celebrating the fe&s;tival of Chri&s;tmas in his company. Ferdinand, after repre&s;enting the im|prudence of his leaving Spain, before he had time to become acquainted with the genius, or to gain the affec|tions of the people, who were one day to be his &s;ub|jects, be&s;ought him at lea&s;t not to pa&s;s through France, with which kingdom he was then at open war.

<P>PHILIP, in pa&s;&s;ing through France, had an interview with Lewis the XII. and &s;igned a treaty with him, by which he hoped that all the differences between France and Spain would be finally terminated. But Ferdinand, who&s;e affairs, at that time, were extremely pro&s;perous in Italy, where the &s;uperior genius of Gon&s;alvo de Cor|dova, the great captain, triumphed, on every occa&s;ion, over the arms of France, did not pay the lea&s;t regard to what his &s;on-in-law had concluded, and carried on ho&s;|tilities with greater ardour than ever.</P>

The union of Ca&s;tile and Aragon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ca&s;tili|ans di&s;&s;atis|fied.</NOTE> for almo&s;t thirty years, had not &s;o entirely extirpated the ancient and hereditary enmity which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the natives of the&s;e kingdoms, that the Ca&s;tilian pride could &s;ubmit, with|out murmuring, to the government of a king of Ara|gon. Ferdinand's own character, with which the Ca&s;ti|lians were well acquainted, was far from rendering his authority de&s;irable. Su&s;picious, di&s;cerning, &s;evere and par&s;imonious, he was accu&s;tomed to ob&s;erve the mo&s;t minute actions of his &s;ubjects with a jealous attention, and to reward their highe&s;t &s;ervices with little liberality; and they were now deprived of I&s;abella, who&s;e gentle qualities, and partiality to her Ca&s;tilian &s;ubjects, often tempered his au&s;terity, or rendered it tolerable. The maxims of his government were e&s;pecially odious to the Grandees; for that artful prince, &s;en&s;ible of the dan|gerous privileges conferred upon them by the feudal in&s;titutions, had endeavoured, by extending the royal juri&s;diction, by protecting their injured va&s;&s;als, by in|crea&s;ing the immunities of cities, and by other mea&s;ures equally prudent, to curb their exorbitant power<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Marian. lib. 28. c. 12.</NOTE>.

If Jo|anna's infirmities, and the nonage of Charles rendered them incapable of government, he, as a hu&s;band, was the proper guardian of his wife, and, as a father, the natural tutor of his &s;on. Nor was it &s;ufficient to oppo&s;e to the&s;e ju&s;t rights, and to the inclination of the people of Ca&s;tile, the authority of a te&s;tament, the ge|nuinene&s;s of which was perhaps doubtful, and its contents certainly iniquitous. A keener edge was added to Phi|lip's re&s;entment, and new vigour infu&s;ed into his coun|cils by the arrival of Don John Manuel. He was Ferdi|nand's amba&s;&s;ador at the Imperial court, but upon the fir&s;t notice of I&s;abella's death repaired to Bru&s;&s;els, flat|tering him&s;elf that in the court of a young and liberal prince, he might attain to power and honours, which he could never hope for in the &s;ervice of an old and frugal ma&s;ter. He had early paid court to Philip, during his re|&s;idence in Spain, with &s;uch a&s;&s;iduity as intirely gained his confidence; and having been trained to bu&s;ine&s;s under Ferdinand, could oppo&s;e his &s;chemes with equal abili|ties, and with arts not inferior to tho&s;e for which that monarch was di&s;tingui&s;hed <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Z<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rita Anales de Aragon, tom. vi. p. 12.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BY his advice, amba&s;&s;adors were di&s;patched to re|quire Ferdinand to retire into Aragon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He requires Ferdinand to re&s;ign the regency.</NOTE> and to re&s;ign the government of Ca&s;tile to tho&s;e per&s;ons whom Philip &s;hould entru&s;t with it till his arrival in that kingdom.

<P>MEANWHILE, Ferdinand employed all the arts of ad|dre&s;s and policy, in order to retain the power of which he had got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. By means of Conchillos, an Aragonian gentleman, he entered into a private nego|ciation with Joanna, and prevailed on that weak prince&s;s

to confirm, by her authority, his right to the regency. But this intrigue did not e&s;cape the penetrating eye of Don John Manuel; Joanna's letter of con&s;ent was in|tercepted; Conchillos was thrown into a dungeon; and &s;he her&s;elf confined to an apartment in the palace, and all her Spani&s;h dome&s;tics &s;ecluded from her pre&s;ence<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">P.

<P>THE mortification which the di&s;covery of this &s;cheme occa&s;ioned to Ferdinand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ferdinand abandoned by the Ca&s;ti|lian nobles.</NOTE> was much increa&s;ed by his ob&s;erving the progre&s;s that Philip's emi&s;|&s;aries made in Ca&s;tile.

<P>A WOMAN, in &s;uch a &s;tate of mind, was little capable of governing a great kingdom; and Joanna,<NOTE PLACE="marg">She is inca|pable of go|vernment.</NOTE> who made it her &s;ole employment to bewail the lo&s;s, and to pray for the &s;oul of her hu&s;|band, would have thought her attention to public af|fairs an impious neglect of tho&s;e duties which &s;he owed to him.

<P>THE death of Philip threw the Ca&s;tilians into the greate&s;t perplexity. It was nece&s;&s;ary to appoint a regent, both on account of Joanna's frenzy, and the infancy of her &s;on; and as there was not among the nobles, any per&s;on &s;o eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed as to be called by the public voice to that high office, all naturally turned their eyes either to Ferdinand, or to the Emperor Maximilian. The former claimed that dignity as admini&s;trator for his daugh|ter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maximili|an the Em|peror and Ferdinand competi|tors for the regency.</NOTE> and by virtue of the te&s;tament of I&s;a|bella; the latter thought him&s;elf the legal guardian of his grand&s;on, whom, on ac|count of his mother's infirmity, he already con&s;idered as king of Ca&s;tile. Tho&s;e who had lately compelled Ferdinand to re&s;ign the government of the kingdom, trembled at the thoughts of his being re&s;tored &s;o &s;oon to his former dignity. They dreaded the return of a monarch not apt to forgive, and who, to tho&s;e de|fects

with which they were already acquainted, added that re&s;entment which the remembrance of their beha|viour, and reflexion upon his own di&s;grace, mu&s;t natu|rally have excited. Though none or the&s;e objections held again&s;t Maximilian, he was a &s;tranger to the laws and manners of Ca&s;tile, and de&s;titute of troops and mo|ney to &s;upport his preten&s;ions, nor co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> his claim be admitted without a public declaration Joanna's inca|pacity for government, an indignity, to which, notwith|&s;tanding the notoriety of her di&s;temper, the delicacy of the Ca&s;tilians would never con&s;ent.</P>
<P>DON John Manuel, however, and a few of the nobles, who con&s;idered them&s;elves as mo&s;t obnoxious to Ferdi|nand's di&s;plea&s;ure, declared for Maximilian, and offered to &s;upport his claim with all their intere&s;t. Maximilian, always enterprizing, and deci&s;ive in council, though feeble and dilatory in execution, eagerly embraced the offer. But a &s;eries of ineffectual negotiations was the only con&s;equence of this tran&s;action.

<P>IT was not, however, the de&s;ire of aggrandizing the archduke, which influenced Ferdinand in this or in any other of his actions. He was more apt to con&s;ider that young prince as a rival, who might, one day, wre&s;t out of his hands the government of Ca&s;tile, than as a grand&s;on, for who&s;e behoof he was entru&s;ted with the admini&s;tration. This jealou&s;y &s;oon begot aver&s;ion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ferdinand jealous of his grand|&s;on Charles.</NOTE> and even hatred, the &s;ymptoms of which he was at no pains to conceal. Hence proceeded his immoderate joy when his young queen was delivered of a &s;on, who&s;e life would have deprived Charles of the crowns of Aragon, Naples, Sicily, and Sardinia; and upon the untimely death of that prince, he di&s;covered, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, an ex|ce&s;&s;ive &s;olicitude to have other children.

Though he now de|&s;paired of having any &s;on of his own, his jealou&s;y of the archduke did not abate, nor could he help viewing him with that aver&s;ion which princes often bear their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.

<P>FERDINAND retained to the la&s;t that jealous love of power, which was &s;o remarkable through his whole life.

nobleman po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in an eminent degree, the talents which fitted him for &s;uch an important office, and di&s;|charged the duties of it with great fidelity. Under Chievres, Adrian of Utrecht acted as preceptor. This preferment, which opened his way to the highe&s;t dig|nities an eccle&s;ia&s;tic can attain, he owed not to his birth, for that was extremely mean; nor to his intere&s;t, for he was a &s;tranger to the arts of a court; but to the opinion which his countrymen entertained of his learning. He was indeed no incon&s;iderable proficient in tho&s;e frivo|lous &s;ciences which, during &s;everal centuries, a&s;&s;umed the name of Philo&s;ophy, and publi&s;hed a commentary, which was highly e&s;teemed, upon The Book of Sen|tences, a famous treati&s;e of Petrus Lombardus, and con&s;idered, at that time, as the &s;tandard &s;y&s;tem of me|taphy&s;ical theology. But whatever admiration the&s;e procured him in an illiterate age, it was &s;oon found that a man accu&s;tomed to the retirement of a college, unac|quainted with the world, and without any tincture of ta&s;te or elegance, was by no means qualified for render|ing &s;cience agreeable to a young prince.

<PB N="351" REF="011837_0370_0F9D86DCC7B5B970">
the Vandals, &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in great force. The nobles, who were powerful and warlike, had long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the exorbitant privileges, which the&s;e in&s;titutions ve&s;ted in their order. The cities in Spain were more numerous and more con&s;iderable than the genius of feudal go|vernment, naturally an enemy to commerce, and to re|gular police, &s;eemed to admit. The per&s;onal rights, and political influence, which the inhabitants of the&s;e cities had acquired, were exten&s;ive. The royal prero|gative circum&s;cribed by the privileges of the nobility, and by the preten&s;ions of the people, was confined within very narrow limits. Under &s;uch a form of go|vernment, the principles of di&s;cord were many; the bond of union was extremely feeble; and Spain felt not only all the inconveniencies occa&s;ioned by the de|fects in the feudal &s;y&s;tem, but was expo&s;ed to di&s;orders ari&s;ing from the peculiarities in its own con&s;titution.</P>
<P>DURING the long admini&s;tration of Ferdinand, no internal commotion, it is true, had ari&s;en in Spain. His &s;uperior abilities enabled him to re&s;train the turbulence of the nobles, and to moderate the jealou&s;y of the com|mons; and by the wi&s;dom of his dome&s;tic government, by the &s;agacity with which he conducted his foreign operations, and by the high opinion that his &s;ubjects entertained of both, he pre&s;erved among them a degree of tranquillity greater than was natural to a con&s;titution, in which the &s;eeds of di&s;cord and di&s;order were &s;o co|piou&s;ly mingled. But, by the death of Ferdinand, the&s;e re&s;traints were at once withdrawn; and faction and di&s;content, from being long repre&s;&s;ed, were ready to break out with fiercer animo&s;ity.</P>
<P>IN order to prevent the&s;e evils,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ferdinand had ap|pointed car|dinal Xime|nes regent.</NOTE> Ferdinand had in his la&s;t will taken a mo&s;t prudent pre|caution, by appointing cardinal Ximenes, archbi&s;hop of Toledo, to be &s;ole regent of Ca&s;tile, till the arrival of his grand&s;on in Spain. The &s;ingular character of this man, and the ex|traordinary qualities which marked him out for that office at &s;uch a juncture, merit a particular de&s;cription.

having determined him to enter into the church, he early obtained benefices of great value, and which pla|ced him in the way of the highe&s;t preferment. All the&s;e however he renounced at once, and after undergoing a very &s;evere noviciate, a&s;&s;umed the habit of St. Francis in a mona&s;tery of Ob&s;ervantine friars, one of the mo&s;t rigid orders in the Romi&s;h church. There he &s;oon be|came eminent for his uncommon au&s;terity of manners, and for tho&s;e exce&s;&s;es of &s;uper&s;titious devotion, which are the proper characteri&s;tics of the mona&s;tic life. But notwith&s;tanding the&s;e extravagancies, to which weak and enthu&s;ia&s;tic minds alone are u&s;ually prone, his un|der&s;tanding, naturally penetrating and deci&s;ive, retained its full vigour, and acquired him &s;uch great authority a|mong his own order, as rai&s;ed him to be their provincial. His reputation for &s;anctity, &s;oon procured him the of|fice of father confe&s;&s;or to the queen I&s;abella, which he accepted with the utmo&s;t reluctance. He pre&s;erved in a court the &s;ame au&s;terity of manners, which had di&s;|tingui&s;hed him in the cloi&s;ter. He continued to make all his journies on foot; he &s;ub&s;i&s;ted only upon alms; his acts of mortification were as &s;evere as ever; and his penances as rigorous. I&s;abella, plea&s;ed with her choice, conferred on him, not long after, the Archbi&s;hopric of Toledo, which, next to the Papacy, is the riche&s;t dignity in the church of Rome. This honour he decli|ned with a firmne&s;s, which nothing but the authoritative injunction of the Pope was able to overcome. Nor did this height of promotion change his manners. Though obliged to di&s;play in public that magnificence which be|came his &s;tation, he him&s;elf retained his mona&s;tic &s;e|verity. Under his pontifical robes he con&s;tantly wore the coar&s;e frock of St. Francis, the rents of which he u&s;ed to patch with his own hands. He at no time u&s;ed lin|nen; but was commonly clad in hair-cloth. He &s;lept always in his habit, mo&s;t frequently on the ground, or on boards, rarely in a bed. He did not ta&s;te any of the delicacies which appeared at his table, but &s;atisfied him&s;elf with that &s;imple diet which the rule in his order pre&s;cribed <NOTE PLACE="foot">Hi&s;toire de l'admini&s;tration du Card.

oppo&s;ite to the manners of the world, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a tho|rough knowledge of its affairs; and no &s;ooner was he called by his &s;tation, and by the high opinion which Fer|dinand and I&s;abella entertained of him, to take a principal &s;hare in the admini&s;tration, than he di&s;played talents for bu&s;ine&s;s, which rendered the fame of his wi&s;dom equal to that of his &s;anctity. Bold and original in all his plans, his political conduct flowed from his real cha|racter, and partook both of its virtues and its defects. His exten&s;ive genius &s;ugge&s;ted to him &s;chemes, va&s;t and magnificent. Con&s;cious of the integrity of his intenti|ons, he pur&s;ued the&s;e with unremitting and undaunted firmne&s;s. Accu&s;tomed from his early youth to morti|fy his own pa&s;&s;ions, he &s;hewed little indulgence towards tho&s;e of other men. Taught by his &s;y&s;tem of religion to check even his mo&s;t innocent de&s;ires, he was the enemy of every thing to which he could affix the name of elegance and plea&s;ure; and, though free from any &s;u&s;|picion of cruelty, he di&s;covered, in all his commerce with the world, a &s;evere inflexibility of mind, and au&s;terity of character, peculiar to the mona&s;tic profe&s;&s;ion, and which can &s;carce be conceived in a country where that is unknown.</P>
<P>SUCH was the man to whom Ferdinand commit|ted the regency of Ca&s;tile, and though he was then near four&s;core, and perfectly acquainted with the labour and difficulty of the office, his natural in|trepidity of mind, and zeal for the public good, prompted him to accept of it without he&s;itation: And though Adrian of Utrecht,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cardinal Adrian ap|pointed re|gent by Charles.</NOTE> who had been &s;ent into Spain a few months before the death of Ferdinand, produced full powers from the archduke to a&s;&s;ume the name and authority of regent, upon the demi&s;e of his grandfather, &s;uch was the aver&s;ion of the Spaniards to the government of a &s;tranger, and &s;o unequal the abili|ties of the two competitors, that Adrian's claim would at once have been rejected, if Ximenes him&s;elf, from complai&s;ance to his new ma&s;ter, had not con&s;ented to acknowledge him as regent, and to carry on the go|vernment in conjunction with him. By this, however,

Ximenes, under pretence of providing more effectually for his &s;afety, removed him from Guadalupe, the place in which he had been educated, to Madrid, where he fixed the re&s;idence of the court. There he was under the cardinal's own eye, and his conduct, with that of his dome&s;tics, were watched with the utmo&s;t atten|tion <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Miniana Contin. Marianae, lib. 1, c. 2.

<P>THE fir&s;t intelligence he received from the Low Countries, gave greater di&s;quiet to the Cardinal, and convinced him how difficult a ta&s;k it would be to con|duct the affairs of a young prince, under the influence of coun&s;ellors unacquainted with the laws and manners of Spain.

the former of whom, it was pretended, had a right, as head of the church, and the latter, as head of the empire, to confer this title; and in&s;tructions were &s;ent to Ximenes, to prevail on the Spaniards to acknow|ledge it.

What Charles required was laid before them; and when, in&s;tead of complying with his demands, they began to murmur again&s;t &s;uch an unprecedented encroachment on their privileges, and to talk high of the rights of Joanna, and their oath of allegiance to her,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Recognized through the influence of Ximenes.

to reap the advantages re&s;ulting from their &s;ucce&s;s. The exorbitant privileges of the Ca&s;tilian nobles circum|&s;cribed the prerogative of the prince within very narrow limits. The&s;e the cardinal con&s;idered as &s;o many unju&s;t extortions from the crown, and determined to reduce them. Dangerous as the attempt was, there were cir|cum&s;tances in his &s;ituation which promi&s;ed him greater &s;ucce&s;s than any king of Ca&s;tile could have expected. His &s;trict and prudent oeconomy of his archiepi&s;copal revenues, furni&s;hed him with more ready money, than the crown could at any time command; the &s;anctity of his manners, his charity and munificence, rendered him the idol of the people; and the nobles them&s;elves, not &s;u&s;pecting any danger from him, did not ob&s;erve his motions, with the &s;ame jealous attention, as they would have watched tho&s;e of one of their monarchs.</P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY upon his acce&s;&s;ion to the regency, &s;e|veral of the nobles, fancying the reins of go|vernment would,<NOTE PLACE="marg">By depre&s;&s;|ing the no|bility.</NOTE> of con&s;equence, be &s;ome|what relaxed, began to a&s;&s;emble their va&s;&s;als, and to pro&s;ecute, by force of arms, animo&s;ities and pre|ten&s;ions, which the authority of Ferdinand had obliged them to di&s;&s;emble, or to relinqui&s;h. But Ximenes, who had taken into pay a good body of troops, oppo&s;ed and defeated all their de&s;igns with unexpected vigour and facility; and though he did not treat the authors of the&s;e di&s;orders with any cruelty, he forced them to acts of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, extremely mortifying to the haughty &s;pi|rit of Ca&s;tilian grandees.</P>
<P>BUT while the Cardinals attacks were confined to in|dividuals,<NOTE PLACE="marg">By forming a body of troops de|pending on the crown.</NOTE> and every act of rigour was ju&s;ti|fied by the appearance of nece&s;&s;ity, founded on the forms of ju&s;tice, and tempered with a mixture of lenity, there was &s;carce room for jealou&s;y or complaint. It was not &s;o with his next mea&s;ure, which, by &s;triking at a privilege e&s;&s;ential to the nobles, gave a general alarm to the whole order. By the feudal con&s;titution, the military power was lodg|ed in the hands of the nobles, and men of an inferior condition were called into the field only as their va&s;&s;als, and to follow their banners. A king, with &s;canty reve|nues, and a limited prerogative, depended on the&s;e po|tent

barons in all his operations. It was with their forces he attacked his enemies, and with them he defended his own kingdom; and while at the head of troops at|tached only to their own lords, and accu&s;tomed to obey no other commands, his authority was precarious, and his efforts feeble. From this &s;tate Ximenes re&s;olved to deliver the crown; and as mercenary &s;tanding armies were unknown, under the feudal government, and would have been odious to a martial and generous people, he i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, commanding every city in Ca&s;tile, to enrol a certain number of its bur|ge&s;&s;es, in order that they might be trained to the u&s;e of arms, on Sundays and holidays; he engaged to provide officers to command them at the public expence; and, as an encouragement to the private men, promi&s;ed them an exemption from all taxes and impo&s;itions. The fre|quent incur&s;ions of the Moors from Africa, and the nece&s;&s;ity of having &s;ome force ready to oppo&s;e them, furni&s;hed a plau&s;ible pretence for this innovation. The object really in view was to &s;ecure the king a body of troops independent of his barons, and which might &s;erve to counterbalance their power <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Minianae Continuatio Marianae fol. Hag. 1733, p. 3.</NOTE>. The nobles were not ignorant of his intention, and &s;aw how effectually the &s;cheme he had adopted would accompli&s;h his end; but as a mea&s;ure which had the pious appearance of re&s;i&s;ting the progre&s;s of the Infidels was extremely popular, and as any oppo&s;ition to it, ari&s;ing from their order alone, would have been imputed wholly to intere&s;ted motives, they endeavoured to excite the cities them&s;elves to re|fu&s;e obedience, and to remon&s;trate again&s;t the procla|mation, as incon&s;i&s;tent with their charters and privileges. In con&s;equence of their in&s;tigations, Burgos, Vallado|lid, and &s;everal other cities, ro&s;e in open mutiny. Some of the grandees declared them&s;elves their protectors. Violent remon&s;trances were pre&s;ented to the king. His Flemi&s;h coun&s;ellors were alarmed. Ximenes alone con|tinued firm and undaunted; and partly by terror, partly by intreaty; by force in &s;ome in&s;tances, and by forbearance in others, he prevailed on all the refractory cities to com|ply <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">P.

his plan with vigour, but &s;oon after his death it was intirely dropt.</P>
<P>HIS &s;ucce&s;s in this &s;cheme for reducing the exorbitant power of the nobility, encouraged him to attempt a diminution of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">By recall|ing the grants of former mo|narchs to the nobili|ty.</NOTE> which were no le&s;s exorbitant. During the conte&s;ts and di&s;orders in&s;eparable from the feudal govern|ment, the nobles, ever attentive to their own intere&s;t, and taking advantage of the weak|ne&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s of their monarchs, had &s;eized &s;ome parts of the royal deme&s;nes, obtained grants of others, and gradually wre&s;ted almo&s;t the whole out of the hands of the prince, and annexed them to their own e&s;tates. The rights, by which mo&s;t of the grandees held the&s;e lands, were extremely defective; it was from &s;ome &s;ucce&s;sful u&s;urpation, which the crown had been too feeble to di&s;pute, that many derived their only title to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. An enquiry carried back to the origin of the&s;e encroachments, which were almo&s;t coeval with the feudal &s;y&s;tem, was impracticable; and as it would have &s;tripped every nobleman in Spain of great part of his lands, it mu&s;t have excited a general revolt. Such a &s;tep was too bold, even for the enterprizing genius of Ximenes. He confined him&s;elf to the reign of Ferdi|nand; and beginning with the pen&s;ions granted during that time, refu&s;ed to make any farther payment, becau&s;e all right to them expired with his life. He then called to account tho&s;e who had acquired crown lands under the admini&s;tration of that monarch, and at once re|&s;umed whatever he had alienated. The effects of the&s;e revocations extended to many per&s;ons of great rank; for though Ferdinand was a prince of little genero&s;ity, yet he and I&s;abella, having been rai&s;ed to the throne of Ca&s;tile by a powerful faction of the nobles, they were obliged to reward the zeal of their adherents with great liberality, and the royal deme&s;nes were their only fund for that purpo&s;e. The addition made to the revenue of the crown by the&s;e revocations, together with his own frugal oeconomy, enabled Ximenes not only to di&s;charge all the debts which Ferdinand had left, and to remit con|&s;iderable &s;ums to Flanders, but to pay the officers of his new militia, and to e&s;tabli&s;h magazines more nume|rous,

and better furni&s;hed with artillery, arms, and war|like &s;tores, than Spain had ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in any former age <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Flechier Vie de Ximen. ii. 600.</NOTE>. The prudent and di&s;intere&s;ted application of the&s;e &s;ums was a full apology to the people for the ri|gour with which they were exacted.</P>
<P>THE nobles, alarmed at the&s;e repeated attacks, thought it nece&s;&s;ary to take precautions for the &s;afety of their order. Many cabals were formed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The nobles oppo&s;e his mea&s;ures.</NOTE> loud complaints were uttered, and de&s;perate re&s;olutions taken; but before they proceeded to extremities, they appointed &s;ome of their number to examine the powers in con&s;equence of which the Cardi|nal exerci&s;ed acts of &s;uch high authority. The admi|ral of Ca&s;tile, the duke de Infantado, and the Cond&eacute; de Benevento, grandees of the fir&s;t rank, were entru&s;ted with this commi&s;&s;ion. Ximenes received them with cold civility, and in an&s;wer to their demand produced the te&s;tament of Ferdinand, by which he was appointed regent, together with the ratification of that deed by Charles. To both the&s;e they objected; and he endea|voured to e&s;tabli&s;h their validity. As the conver&s;ation grew warm,<NOTE PLACE="marg">But with|out &s;ucce&s;s.</NOTE> he led them in&s;en&s;ibly towards a balcony, from which they had a view of a large body of troops, under arms, and of a formidable train of artillery. "Behold," &s;ays he, pointing to the&s;e, and rai&s;ing his voice, "the powers which I have received from his catholic maje&s;ty. With the&s;e I govern Ca&s;tile; and with the&s;e I will govern it, till the king, your ma&s;ter and mine, takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his kingdom <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Flech. ii. 551. Ferreras, Hi&s;t. viii. 433.</NOTE>." A declaration &s;o bold and haughty &s;ilenced them, and a&s;toni&s;hed their a&s;|&s;ociates. To take arms again&s;t a man aware of his danger, and prepared for his defence, was what de|&s;pair alone would dictate. All thoughts of a general confederacy again&s;t the Cardinal's admini&s;tration were laid a&s;ide; and, except from &s;ome &s;light commotions excited by the private re&s;entment of particular noblemen, the tranquillity of Ca&s;tile &s;uffered no interruption.</P>
<P><PB N="360" REF="011837_0379_0F9D86E37674B068">IT was not only from the oppo&s;ition of the Spani&s;h nobility that ob&s;tacles aro&s;e to the execution of the Cardinal's &s;chemes;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thwarted by Charles's Flemi&s;h mi|ni&s;ters.</NOTE> he had a con&s;tant &s;truggle to maintain with the Fle|mi&s;h mini&s;ters, who, pre&s;uming upon their favour with the young king, aimed at directing the affairs of Spain, as well as tho&s;e of their own country. Jealous of his great abilities, and independent &s;pirit, they con&s;idered him rather as a rival, who might circum&s;cribe their pow|er, than as a mini&s;ter, who, by his prudence and vigour was adding to the grandeur and authority of their ma&s;ter. Every complaint again&s;t his admini&s;tration was li&s;tened to with plea&s;ure by the courtiers in the Low Countries. Unnece&s;&s;ary ob&s;tructions were thrown by their means in the way of all his mea&s;ures, and though they could not, either with decency or &s;afety, deprive him of the office of regent, they endeavoured to le&s;&s;en his authority by dividing it. They &s;oon di&s;covered that Adrian of U|trecht, already joined with him in office, had neither genius or &s;pirit &s;ufficient to give the lea&s;t check to his proceedings; and therefore Charles by their advice added to the commi&s;&s;ion of regency La Chau,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An additi|onal num|ber of re|gents ap|pointed.</NOTE> a Flemi&s;h gentleman, and afterwards Amer|&s;torf, a nobleman of Holland; the former di&s;tingui&s;hed for his addre&s;s; the latter for his firmne&s;s. Ximenes, though no &s;tranger to the malevolent intention of the Flemi&s;h courtiers, re|ceived them with all the external marks of di&s;tinction due to the office with which they were inve&s;ted; but when they came to enter upon bu&s;ine&s;s, he abated no|thing of that air of &s;uperiority with which he had treat|ed Adrian, and &s;till retained the &s;ole direction of affairs. The Spaniards, more aver&s;e, perhaps, than any other people to the government of &s;trangers, approved of all his efforts to pre&s;erve his authority;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ximenes retains the direction of affairs.</NOTE> and even the nobles, influenced by this national pa&s;&s;ion, and forgetting their jealou&s;ies and di&s;contents, cho&s;e rather to &s;ee the &s;u|preme power in the hands of one of their countrymen, whom they feared, than in tho&s;e of foreigners, whom they hated.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE REIGN OF THE EMPEROR CHARLES V. BOOK I. <HI>(Part II.)</HI></HEAD>
<P>XIMENES, though engaged in &s;uch great &s;chemes of dome&s;tic policy, and embar|ra&s;&s;ed by the artifices and intrigues of the Flemi&s;h mini&s;ters, had the burden of two foreign wars to &s;upport. The one was in Na|varre, invaded by its unfortunate monarch, John d'Al|bret. The death of Ferdinand, the ab&s;ence of Charles, and the di&s;cord and di&s;affection which reigned among the Spani&s;h nobles, &s;eemed to pre&s;ent him with a fa|vourable opportunity of recovering his dominions. The Cardinal's vigilance, however, defeated a mea&s;ure &s;o well concerted. Fore&s;eeing the danger to which that kingdom might be expo&s;ed, one of his fir&s;t acts of admini&s;tration was to order thither a con&s;iderable body of troops. While the king was employed with one part of his army in the &s;iege of St. Jean Pied en Port, Villalva, an officer of great experience and courage, attacked the other by &s;urprize, and cut it to pieces. The king in&s;tantly retreated with precipitation, and an end was put to the war <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">P. Mart. Ep 570.</NOTE>. But as Navarre was filled
<PB N="2" REF="011837_0410_0F9D879792673A38">
at that time with towns and ca&s;tles, &s;lightly fortified, and weakly garri&s;oned, which being unable to re&s;i&s;t an enemy, &s;erved only to furni&s;h him with places of retreat; Ximenes, always bold and deci&s;ive in his mea&s;ures, or|dered every one of the&s;e to be di&s;mantled, except Pam|peluna, the fortifications of which he propo&s;ed to render very &s;trong. To this uncommon precaution Spain owes the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Navarre. The French, &s;ince that period, have often entered, and have as often over-run the open country; but while they were expo&s;ed to all the inconveniencies attending an invading army, the Spaniards have ea&s;ily drawn troops from the neighbour|ing provinces to oppo&s;e them; and the French, being de&s;titute of &s;trong towns to which they could retire, have been obliged to abandon their conque&s;t with as much rapidity as they gained it.</P>
<P>THE war which he carried on in Africa, again&s;t the famous adventurer Horuc Barbaro&s;&s;a, who, from a private cor&s;air, rai&s;ed him&s;elf by his &s;ingular valour and addre&s;s, to be king of Algiers and Tunis, was far from being equally &s;ucce&s;sful. The ill conduct of the Spa|ni&s;h general, and the ra&s;h valour of his troops, pre&s;ented Barbaro&s;&s;a with an ea&s;y victory. Many peri&s;hed in the battle, more in the retreat, and the remainder returned into Spain covered with infamy. The magnanimity, however, with which the Cardinal bore this di&s;grace, the only one he experienced during his admini&s;tration, ad|ded new lu&s;tre to his character <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gometius, lib. vi. p. 179.</NOTE>. Great compo&s;ure of temper under a di&s;apointment, was not expected from a man &s;o remarkable for the eagerne&s;s and impatience with which he urged on the execution of all his &s;chemes.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;a&s;ter was &s;oon forgotten; while the conduct of the Flemi&s;h court proved the cau&s;e of con&s;tant unea&s;i|ne&s;s, not only to the Cardinal, but to the whole Spa|ni&s;h nation. All the great qualities of Chievres, the prime mini&s;ter and favourite of the young king, were &s;ullied with an ignoble and &s;ordid avarice. The acce&s;|&s;ion of his ma&s;ter to the crown of Spain, opened a new and copious &s;ource for the gratification of this pa&s;&s;ion. During the time of Charles's re&s;idence in Flanders, the
<PB N="3" REF="011837_0411_0F9D879932646FB8">
whole tribe of pretenders to offices or to favour re&s;orted thither. They &s;oon di&s;covered that, without the patron|age of Chievres, it was vain to hope for preferment; nor did they want &s;agacity to find out the proper method of &s;ecuring him. Va&s;t &s;ums of money were drawn out of Spain. Every thing was venal, and di&s;po&s;ed of to the highe&s;t bidder. After the example Chievres, the inferior Flemi&s;h mini&s;ters engaged in this traffick, which became as general and avowed, as it was infamous <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Miniana. Contin. l. i. c. 2.</NOTE>. The Spaniards were filled with rage when they beheld offices of great importance to the welfare of their coun|try, &s;et to &s;ale by &s;trangers, unconcerned for its honour or its happine&s;s. Ximenes; di&s;intere&s;ted in his whole admini&s;tration, and a &s;tranger, from his native grandeur of mind, to the pa&s;&s;ion of avarice, inveighed with the utmo&s;t boldne&s;s again&s;t the venality of the Flemings. He repre&s;ented to the King in &s;trong terms, the mur|murs and indignation which their behaviour excited among a free and high-&s;pirited people, and be&s;ought him to &s;et out without lo&s;s of time for Spain, that, by his pre&s;ence, he might di&s;&s;ipate the clouds which were ga|thering all over the kingdom <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">P. Mart. Ep. 576.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CHARLES was fully &s;en&s;ible that he had delayed too long to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his dominions in Spain. Pow|erful ob&s;tacles, however, &s;tood in his way, and detained him in the Low Countries. The war which the league of Cambray, had kindled in Italy, &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted; though during its cour&s;e, the armies of all the parties engaged in it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> taken different directions. France was now in alliance with Venice, which it had at fir&s;t combined to de&s;troy. Maximilian and Ferdinand had for &s;ome years carried on ho&s;tilities again&s;t France, their original ally, to the valour of who&s;e troops the confederacy ow|ed all its &s;ucce&s;s. Together with his kingdoms, Ferdi|nand tran&s;mitted this war to his grand&s;on; and there was rea&s;on to expect that Maximilian, always fond of new enterprizes, would per&s;uade the young monarch to enter into with ardour. But the Flemings, who had long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an exten&s;ive commerce, which during the league of Cambray, had grown to a great height upon
<PB N="4" REF="011837_0412_0F9D8799CC53D688">
the ruins of the Venetian trade, dreaded a rupture with France; and Chievres, &s;agacious to di&s;cern the true in|tere&s;t of his country, and not warped on this occa&s;ion by his love of wealth, warmly declared for maintaining peace with the French nation. Francis I. de&s;titute of allies, and &s;olicitous to &s;ecure his late conque&s;ts in Italy by a treaty, li&s;tened with joy to the fir&s;t overtures of accommodation. Chievres him&s;elf conducted the ne|gociation in name of Charles. Gouffier appeared as plenipotentiary for Francis. Each of them had pre&s;id|ed over the education of the prince whom he repre&s;ent|ed. They had both adapted the &s;ame pacific &s;y&s;tem; and were equally per&s;uaded that the union of the two monarchs was the happie&s;t event for them&s;elves, as well as for their kingdoms. In &s;uch hands the negociation did not langui&s;h. A few days after opening their con|ferences at Noyon, they concluded a treaty of confe|deracy and mutual defence between the two monarchs; Aug. 13, 1516. the chief articles in which were, that Francis &s;hould give in marriage to Charles his elde&s;t daughter, the prince&s;s Loui&s;a, an infant of a year old, and as her dowry, &s;hould make over to him all his claims and preten&s;ions upon the kingdom of Naples; that in con&s;ideration of Charles's being already in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of Naples, he &s;hould till the accompli&s;hment of the marriage pay an hundred thou&s;and crowns a year to the French king; and the half of that &s;um annually, as long as the prince&s;s had no children; that when Charles &s;hall arrive in Spain, the heirs of the King of Navarre may repre&s;ent to him their right to that kingdom: and if he do not give them &s;atisfaction, Francis &s;hall be at liberty to a&s;&s;i&s;t them with all his forces <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Leonard Recueil des Traitez, tom. ii. 69.</NOTE>. This alli|ance not only united Charles and Francis, but obliged Maximilian, who was unable alone to cope with the French and Venetians, to enter into a treaty with tho&s;e powers, which put a final period to that bloody and te|dious war which the league of Cambray had occa&s;ioned. Europe enjoyed a few years of univer&s;al tranquillity, and was indebted for that ble&s;&s;ing to two princes, who&s;e rival&s;hip and ambition kept it in perpetual di&s;cord and agitation during the remainder of their reigns.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="011837_0413_0F9D879A70CA0168">BY the treaty of Noyon, Charles &s;ecured a &s;afe pa&s;|&s;age into Spain. It was not, however, the intere&s;t of his Flemi&s;h mini&s;ters, that he &s;hould vi&s;it that kingdom &s;oon. While he re&s;ided in Flanders, the revenues of the Spani&s;h crown were &s;pent there, and they engro&s;|&s;ed, without any competitors, all the effects of their monarch's genero&s;ity; their country became the &s;eat of government, and all favours were di&s;pen&s;ed by them. Of all the&s;e advantages, they ran the ri&s;que of &s;eeing them&s;elves deprived, from the moment that their &s;overeign entered Spain. The Spaniards would naturally a&s;&s;ume the direction of their own affairs; the Low Countries would be con&s;idered only as a province of that mighty monarchy; and they who now di&s;tri|buted the favours of the prince to others, mu&s;t then be content to receive them from the hands of &s;trangers. But what Chievres chiefly wi&s;hed to avoid was, an interview between the King and Ximenes. On the other hand, the wi&s;dom, the integrity, and the mag|nanimity of that prelate, gave him a wonderful a&s;|cendant over the minds of men; and it was extremely probable, the&s;e great qualities, added to the reverence due to his age and office, would command the re&s;pect of a young prince, who, capable of noble and generous &s;entiments him&s;elf, would, in proportion to his admi|ration of the Cardinal's virtues, le&s;&s;en his deference towards per&s;ons of another character. Or, on the other hand, if Charles &s;hould allow his Flemi&s;h fa|vourites to retain all the influence over his councils which they at pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, it was ea&s;y to fore|&s;ee that the Cardinal would remon&s;trate loudly again&s;t &s;uch an indignity to the Spani&s;h nation, and vindicate the rights of his country with the &s;ame in|trepidity and &s;ucce&s;s, that he had a&s;&s;erted the pre|rogatives of the crown. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, all his Flemi&s;h coun&s;ellors combined to retard his departure; and Charles, un&s;u&s;picious, from want of experience, and fond of his native country, &s;uffered him&s;elf to be unnece&s;&s;arily detained in the Netherlands a whole year after &s;igning the treaty of Noyon.</P>
<P>THE repeated intreaties of Ximenes, the advice of his grandfather Maximilian, and the impatient mur|murs

of his Spani&s;h &s;ubjects in 1517. prevailed on him at la&s;t to embark, Sept. 13. He was attended not only by Chievres, his prime-mini&s;ter, but by a nume|rous and &s;plendid train of the Flemi&s;h nobles, fond of beholding the grandeur, or of &s;haring in the boun|ty of their prince. After a dangerous voyage, he landed at Villa Vicio&s;a, in the province of A&s;turias, and was received with &s;uch loud acclamations of joy, as a new monarch, who&s;e arrival was &s;o ardently de|&s;ired, had rea&s;on to expect. The Spani&s;h nobility re&s;orted to their &s;overeign from all parts of the king|dom, and di&s;played a magnificence which the Flem|ings were unable to emulate<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">P. Mart. Ep. 599. 601.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>XIMENES, who con&s;idered the pre&s;ence of the king as the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing to his dominions, was advanc|ing towards the coa&s;t, as fa&s;t as the infirm &s;tate of his health would permit, in order to receive him. Dur|ing his regency, and notwith&s;tanding his extreme old age, he abated, in no degree, the rigour or frequency of his mortifications; and to the&s;e he added &s;uch labo|rious a&s;&s;iduity in bu&s;ine&s;s, as would have worn out the mo&s;t youthful and vigorous con&s;titution. Every day he employed &s;everal hours in devotion; he celebrated ma&s;s in per&s;on; he even allotted &s;ome &s;pace for &s;tudy. Not|with&s;tanding the&s;e occupations he regularly attended the council; he received and read all papers pre&s;ented to him; he dictated letters and in&s;tructions; and took un|der his in&s;pection all bu&s;ine&s;s, civil, eccle&s;ia&s;tical, or mi|litary. Every moment of his time was filled up with &s;ome &s;erious employment. The only amu&s;ement in which he indulged him&s;elf by way of relaxation after bu&s;ine&s;s, was to canva&s;s, with a few friars and divines, &s;ome intricate article in &s;chola&s;tic theology. Wa&s;ted by &s;uch a cour&s;e of life, the infirmities of age daily grew upon him. On his journey, a violent di&s;order &s;eized him at Bos Equillos, attended with uncommon &s;ymp|toms; which his followers con&s;idered as the effects of poi&s;on <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Miniana, Contin. lib. i. c. 3</NOTE>, but could not agree whether the crime ought to be imputed to the hatred of the Spani&s;h noble, or to
<PB N="7" REF="011837_0415_0F9D879BF6090DB8">
the malice of the Flemi&s;h courtiers. This accident obliging him to &s;top &s;hort, he wrote to Charles, and with his u&s;ual boldne&s;s advi&s;ed him to di&s;mi&s;s all the &s;trangers in his train, who&s;e numbers and credit gave offence already to the Spaniards, and would ere long alienate the affections of the whole people. At the &s;ame time he earne&s;tly de&s;ired to have an interview with the king, that he might inform him of the &s;tate of the na|tion, and the temper of his &s;ubjects. To prevent this, not only the Flemings, but the Spani&s;h Grandees em|ployed all their addre&s;s, and indu&s;triou&s;ly kept Charles at a di&s;tance from Aranda, the place to which the Car|dinal had removed. Through their &s;ugge&s;tions, every mea&s;ure that he recommended was rejected; the utmo&s;t care was taken to make him feel, and to point out to the whole nation, that his power was on the decline; even in things purely trivial, &s;uch a choice was al|ways made, as was deemed mo&s;t di&s;agreeable to him. Ximenes did not bear this treatment with his u&s;ual for|titude of &s;pirit. Con&s;cious of his own integrity and me|rit, he expected a more grateful return from a prince, to whom he delivered a kingdom more flouri&s;hing than it had been in any former age, and authority more ex|ten&s;ive and better e&s;tabli&s;hed, than the mo&s;t illu&s;trious of his ance&s;tors had ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. He could not, there|fore, on many occa&s;ions, refrain from giving vent to his indignation and complaints. He lamented the fate of his country, and foretold the calamities it would &s;uffer from the in&s;olence, the rapaciou&s;ne&s;s, and ignorance of &s;trangers. While his mind was agitated by the&s;e pa&s;|&s;ions, he received a letter from the king, in which, after a few cold and formal expre&s;&s;ions of regard, he was al|lowed to retire to his dioce&s;e; that after a life of &s;uch continued labour, he might end his days in tranquillity. This me&s;&s;age proved fatal to Ximenes. His haughty mind, it is probable, would not &s;urvive di&s;grace; per|haps his generous heart could not bear the pro&s;pect of the misfortunes ready to fall on his country. Which|&s;oever of the&s;e opinions we embrace, certain it is that he expired Nov. 8, a few hours after reading the letter <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Mar&s;allier Vie de Ximenes, p. 447.

The variety, the grandeur, and the &s;ucce&s;s of his &s;chemes, during a regency of only twenty months, leave it doubtful whether his &s;agacity in council, his prudence in conduct, or his boldne&s;s in execution de&s;erve the greate&s;t prai&s;e. His reputation is &s;till high in Spain, not only for wi&s;dom, but for &s;anctity; and he is the on|ly prime mini&s;ter mentioned in hi&s;tory, whom his con|temporaries reverenced as a &s;aint <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Flechier, Vie de Ximen. ii. 746.</NOTE>, and to whom the people under his government a&s;cribed the power of working miracles.</P>
<P>SOON after the death of Ximenes, Charles made his public entry, with great pomp, into Valladolid in 1518, whither he had &s;ummoned the Cortes of Ca&s;tile, though he a&s;&s;umed on all occa&s;ions the name of king, that title had never been acknowledged in the Cortes. The Spa|niards con&s;idering Joanna as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;ole right to the crown, and no example of a &s;on's having en|joyed the title of king during the life of his parents oc|curring in their hi&s;tory, the Cortes di&s;covered all that &s;crupulous re&s;pect for ancient forms, and that aver&s;ion to innovation, which are con&s;picuous in popular a&s;&s;em|blies. The pre&s;ence, however, of their prince, the ad|dre&s;s, the artifices, and the threats of his mini&s;ters, pre|vailed on them at la&s;t to declare him king, in conjunc|tion with his mother, who&s;e name they appointed to be placed before that of her &s;on in all publick acts; and de|clared that, if at any future period &s;he &s;hould recover the exerci&s;e of rea&s;on, the whole royal authority &s;hould return into her hands. At the &s;ame time, they voted a free gift of &s;ix hundred thou&s;and ducats to be paid in three years, a &s;um more con&s;iderable than had ever been granted to any former monarch <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Miniana, Contin. lib. i. c. 3.

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING this ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s of the Cor|tes to the will of the king, the mo&s;t violent &s;ymptoms of di&s;&s;atisfaction with his government began to break out in the kingdom. Chievres had acquired over the mind of the young monarch the a&s;cendant not only of a tutor, but of a parent. Charles &s;eemed to have no &s;entiments but tho&s;e which his mini&s;ter in&s;pired, and
<PB N="9" REF="011837_0417_0F9D879D71E894B0">
&s;carce uttered a word but what he put into his mouth. He was con&s;tantly &s;urrounded by Flemings; no per&s;on got acce&s;s to him without their permi&s;&s;ion; nor was any admitted to audience but in their pre&s;ence. As he &s;poke the Spani&s;h language very imperfectly, his an&s;wers were always extremely &s;hort, and often delivered with he&s;itation. From all the&s;e circum&s;tances, many of the Spaniards were led to believe that he was a prince of a &s;low and narrow genius; &s;ome pretended to di&s;cover a &s;trong re&s;emblance between him and his mother, and be|gan to whi&s;per that his capacity for government would never be far &s;uperior to hers; and though they who had the be&s;t opportunity of judging concerning his cha|racter, maintained, that notwith&s;tanding &s;uch unpro|mi&s;ing appearances, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a large fund of know|ledge and &s;agacity <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Sandoval, p. 31.

Un|fortunately for Charles, the&s;e favourites were unworthy of his confidence. To ama&s;s wealth &s;eems to have been their only aim; and as they had rea&s;on to fear, that ei|ther their ma&s;ter's good &s;en&s;e, or the indignation of the Spaniards, might &s;oon abridge their power, they ha&s;ten|ed to improve the pre&s;ent opportunity, and their avarice was the more rapacious, becau&s;e they expected their au|thority to be of no long duration. All honours, offices and benefices, were either engro&s;&s;ed by the Flemings, or publickly &s;old by them. Chievres, his wife, and Sau|vage, whom Charles, on the death of Ximenes, had im|prudently rai&s;ed to be chancellor of Ca&s;tile, vied with each other in all the refinements of extortion and venali|ty.

To this prudent precaution, Charles owed the pre&s;ervation of his Spani&s;h dominions. During the violent commotions which aro&s;e there &s;oon after this period, the Spaniards would infallibly have offered the crown to a prince, who was the darling of the whole nation; nor did Ferdinand want ambition, or cou&s;el|lors, that would have prompted him to accept of the offer <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">P.

<P>THE Aragone&s;e had not hitherto acknowledged Charles as King, nor would they allow the Cortes to be a&s;&s;embled in his name, but in that of the Ju&s;tiza, to whom, during an interregnum, this privilege belonged <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">P.

The oppo&s;ition Charles had to &s;truggle with in the Cor|tes of Aragon, was more violent and ob&s;tinate than that which he had overcome in Ca&s;tile; after long delays, however, and with much difficulty, he per&s;uaded the members to confer on him the title of king, in con|junction with his mother. At the &s;ame time he bound him&s;elf by that &s;olemn oath, which the Aragone&s;e ex|acted of their king, never to violate any of their rights or liberties. When a donative was demanded, the mem|bers

were &s;till more intractable; many months elap&s;ed before they would agree to grant Charles two hundred thou&s;and ducats, and that &s;um they appropriated &s;o &s;trictly for paying debts of the crown, which had long been forgotten, that a very &s;mall part of it came into the King's hands. What had happened in Ca&s;tile taught them caution, and determined them rather to &s;atisfy the claims of their fellow citizens, how ob&s;olete &s;oever, than to furni&s;h &s;trangers the means of enriching them&s;elves with the &s;poils of their country <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">P.

<P>DURING the&s;e proceedings of the Cortes, amba&s;&s;a|dors arrived at Sarago&s;&s;a from Francis I. and the young king of Navarre, demanding the re&s;titution of that kingdom in terms of the treaty of Noyon. But neither Charles, nor the Ca&s;tilian nobles whom he con&s;ulted on this occa&s;ion, di&s;covered any inclination to part with this acqui&s;ition. A conference held &s;oon after at Mont|pelier, in order to bring this matter to an amicable i&s;&s;ue, was altogether fruitle&s;s; and while the French urged the inju&s;tice of the u&s;urpation, the Spaniards were at|tentive only to its importance <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">P.

<P>FROM Aragon, Charles proceeded to Catalonia in 1519, where he wa&s;ted as much time, encountered more difficulties, and gained le&s;s money. The Flemings were now become &s;o odious in every province of Spain by their exactions, that the de&s;ire of mortifying them, and of di&s;appointing their avarice, augmented the jealou|&s;y with which a free people u&s;ually conduct their delibe|rations.</P>
<P>THE Ca&s;tilians, who had felt mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly the weight and rigour of the oppre&s;&s;ive &s;chemes, carried on by the Flemings, re&s;olved no longer to &s;ubmit with a tamene&s;s fatal to them&s;elves, and which rendered them the ob|jects of &s;corn among the re&s;t of the Spaniards. Sego|via, Toledo, Seville, and &s;everal other cities of the fir&s;t rank, entered into a confederacy for the defence of their rights and privileges; and notwith&s;tanding the &s;i|lence of the nobility, who, on this occa&s;ion, di&s;covered neither the publick &s;pirit, nor the re&s;olution which be|came their order, they laid before the king a full view

of the &s;tate of the kingdom, and of the mal-admini&s;|tration of his favourites. The preferment of &s;trangers; the exportation of the current coin; the increa&s;e of taxes, were the grievances of which they chiefly complained; and of the&s;e they demanded redre&s;s with that boldne&s;s, which is natural to a free people. The&s;e remon&s;trances, pre&s;ented at fir&s;t at Sarago&s;&s;a, and renewed afterwards at Barcelona, Charles treated with great neglect. The confederacy, however, of the&s;e cities at this juncture, was the beginning of that famous union among the com|mons of Ca&s;tile, which not long after threw the king|dom into &s;uch violent convul&s;ions, &s;hook the throne, and almo&s;t overturned the con&s;titution <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">P.

<P>SOON after Charles's arrival at Barcelona, he received the account of an event which intere&s;ted him much more than the murmurs of the Ca&s;tilians, or the &s;crup|les of the Cortes of Catalonia. This was the death of the Emperor Maximilian, January 12, an occurrence of &s;mall importance in it&s;elf, for he was a prince con|&s;picuous neither for his virtues, his power, nor his abi|lities; but rendered by its con&s;equences more memo|rable than any that had happened during &s;everal ages. It broke that profound and univer&s;al peace which then reigned in the Chri&s;tian world; it excited a rival&s;hip between two princes, which threw all Europe into agi|tation, and kindled wars more general, and of longer duration, than had hitherto been known in modern times.</P>
<P>THE revolutions occa&s;ioned by the expedition of the French king, Charles VIII. into Italy, had in&s;pired the European Princes with new ideas concerning the impor|tance of the Imperial dignity. The claims of the Em|pire upon &s;ome of the Italian &s;tates were numerous; its juri&s;diction over others was exten&s;ive; and though the former had been almo&s;t abandoned, and the latter &s;el|dom exerci&s;ed, under princes of no abilities, and of little influence, it was obvious, that in the hands of an Em|peror po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of power and genius, they would be em|ployed as engines for &s;tretching his dominion over the greater part of that country. Even Maximilian, feeble
<PB N="13" REF="011837_0421_0F9D87A085CF4E00">
and un&s;teady as his conduct always was, had availed him&s;elf of the infinite preten&s;ions of the Empire, and had reaped advantage from every war and every nego|ciation in Italy during his reign. The&s;e con&s;iderations, added to the dignity of the &s;tation, confe&s;&s;edly the fir&s;t among Chri&s;tian princes, and to the rights inherent in the office, which, if exerted with vigour, were far from being incon&s;iderable, rendered the imperial crown more than ever an object of ambition.</P>
<P>NOT long before his death, Maximilian had di&s;covered great &s;olicitude to pre&s;erve this dignity in the Au&s;trian family, and to procure the king of Spain to be cho&s;en his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. But he him&s;elf having never been crown|ed by the Pope, a ceremony deemed e&s;&s;ential in that age, was con&s;idered only as Emperor <HI>elect;</HI> and though hi&s;torians did not attend to that di&s;tinction, neither the Italian nor German chancery be&s;towed any other title upon him than that of King of the Romans; and no example occurring in hi&s;tory of any per&s;on's being cho|&s;en a &s;ucce&s;&s;or to a king of the Romans, the Germans, always tenacious of their forms, and unwilling to con|fer upon Charles an office for which their con&s;titution knew no name, ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed to gratify Maximi|lian in that point <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Guicciardini, lib. 13. p. 15.

<P>BY his death, this difficulty was at once removed, and Charles openly a&s;pired to that dignity which his grandfather had attempted, without &s;ucce&s;s to &s;ecure for him. At the &s;ame time Francis I. a powerful rival, entered the li&s;ts again&s;t him; and the attention of all Europe was fixed upon this competition, no le&s;s illu&s;|trious from the high rank of the candidates, than from the importance of the prize for which they contended. Each of them urged his preten&s;ions with &s;anguine ex|pectations, and with no unpromi&s;ing pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. Charles con&s;idered the Imperial crown as belonging to him of right, from its long continuance in the Au&s;trian line; he knew that none of the German princes po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed power or influence enough to appear as his antago|ni&s;t; he flattered him&s;elf, that no con&s;ideration would
<PB N="14" REF="011837_0422_0F9D87A1F8299FE0">
induce the natives of Germany to exalt any foreign prince to a dignity, which during &s;o many ages had been deemed peculiar to their own nation; and lea&s;t of all, that they would confer this honour upon Francis I. the &s;overeign of a people who&s;e genius, and laws, and man|ners differed &s;o widely from tho&s;e of the Germans, that it was &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to e&s;tabli&s;h any cordial union between them: he tru&s;ted not a little to the effect of Maximilian's negociations, which though they did not attain their end, had prepared the minds of the Ger|mans for his elevation to the imperial throne; but what he relied on as his chief recommendation, was the for|tunate &s;ituation of his hereditary dominions in Germa|ny, which &s;erved as a natural barrier to the Empire again&s;t the encroachments of the Turki&s;h power. The conque&s;ts, the abilities, and the ambition of Sultan Se|lim II. had &s;pread over Europe, at that time, a gene|ral and well founded alarm. By his victories over the Marmalukes&punc; and the extirpation of that gallant body of men, he had not only added Egypt and Syria to his empire, but had &s;ecured to it &s;uch a degree of internal tranquillity, that he was ready to turn again&s;t Chri&s;ten|dom the whole force of his arms, which nothing had hitherto been able to re&s;i&s;t: The mo&s;t effectual expe|dient for &s;topping the progre&s;s of this torrent, &s;eemed to be the election of an Emperor, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of exten&s;ive territories in that country, where its fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion would be felt, and who, be&s;ides, could combat this for|midable enemy with all the forces of a powerful mo|narchy, and with all the wealth furni&s;hed by the mines of the new world, or the commerce of the Low Coun|tries. The&s;e were the arguments by which Charles publickly &s;upported his claim; and to men of integrity and reflection, they appeared to be not only plau&s;ible, but convincing. He did not, however, tru&s;t the &s;uc|ce&s;s of his cau&s;e to the&s;e alone. Great &s;ums of money were remitted from Spain; all the refinements and ar|tifice of negociation were employed; and a con&s;iderable body of troops kept on foot by the &s;tates of the Circle of Suabia, was &s;ecretly taken into his pay. The venal were gained by pre&s;ents; the objections of the more

<P>ON the other hand, Francis &s;upported his claim with equal eagerne&s;s, and no le&s;s confidence of its being well founded. His emi&s;&s;aries contended that it was now high time to convince the Princes of the hou&s;e of Au&s;|tria that the Imperial crown was elective, and not here|ditary; and that other per&s;ons might a&s;pire to an honour which their arrogance had come to regard as the pro|perty of their family; that it required a &s;overeign of mature judgment, and of approved abilities, to hold the reins of government in a country where &s;uch un|known opinions concerning religion had been publi&s;hed, as had thrown the minds of men into an uncommon a|gitation, which threatened the mo&s;t violent effects; that a young prince, without experience, who had hitherto given no &s;pecimens of his genius for command, was no equal match for Selim, a monarch, grown old in the art of war, and in the cour&s;e of victory; whereas a king, who, in his early youth had triumphed over the valour and di&s;cipline of the Swi&s;s, till then reckoned invincible, would be an antagoni&s;t not unworthy of the conqueror of the Ea&s;t; that the fire and impetuo&s;ity of the French cavalry, added to the di&s;cipline and &s;tability of the Ger|man infantry, would form an army &s;o irre&s;i&s;tible, that in&s;tead of waiting the approach of the Ottoman forces, it might carry ho&s;tilities into the heart of their domi|nions; that the election of Charles would be incon&s;i&s;t|ent with a fundamental con&s;titution, by which the per|&s;on who holds the crown of Naples, is excluded from a&s;piring to the Imperial dignity; that his elevation to that honour would &s;oon kindle a war in Italy, on ac|count of his preten&s;ions to the dutchy of Milan, the effects of which could not fail of reaching the Empire, and might prove fatal to it <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Guic. lib. 13. 160.

But while his amba&s;&s;a|dors enlarged upon the&s;e and other topicks of the &s;ame kind, in all the courts of Germany, Francis, &s;en&s;ible of the prejudices entertained again&s;t him as a foreigner,

unacquainted with the German language or manners, endeavoured to overcome the&s;e, and to gain the favour of the princes by immen&s;e gifts, and by infinite pro|mi&s;es. As the expeditious method of tran&s;mitting mo|ney, and the decent mode of conveying a bribe by bills of exchange was then little known, the French amba&s;|&s;adors travelled with a train of hor&s;es loaded with trea|&s;ure, an equipage not very honourable for that prince by whom they were employed, and infamous for tho&s;e to whom they were &s;ent <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Memoires de Marech. de Fleuranges, p. 296.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE other European princes could not remain in|different &s;pectators of a conte&s;t, the deci&s;ion of which &s;o nearly affected them. Their common intere&s;t ought naturally to have formed a general combination, in order to di&s;appoint both competitors, and to prevent either of them from obtaining &s;uch pre-eminence in power and dignity, as might prove dangerous to the liberties of Europe. But the ideas with re&s;pect to a proper di&s;tribution and balance of power were &s;o lately introduced into the &s;y&s;tem of European policy, that they were not hitherto objects of &s;ufficient attention. The pa&s;&s;ions of &s;ome princes, the want of fore&s;ight in others, and the fear of giving offence to the candidates, hindred &s;uch a &s;alutary union of the powers of Europe, and rendered them either totally negligent of the pub|lick &s;afety, or kept them from exerting them&s;elves with vigour in its behalf.</P>
<P>THE Swi&s;s Cantons, though they dreaded the eleva|tion of either of the contending monarchs, and though they wi&s;hed to have &s;een &s;ome prince who&s;e dominions were le&s;s exten&s;ive, and who&s;e power was more mode|rate, &s;eated on the Imperial throne, were prompted, however, by their hatred of the French nation, to give an open preference to the preten&s;ions of Charles, while they u&s;ed their utmo&s;t influence to fru&s;trate tho&s;e of Francis <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Sabinus, p. 6</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Venetians ea&s;ily di&s;cerned, that it was the in|tere&s;t of their republick to have both the rivals &s;et a&s;ide; but their jealou&s;y of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, who&s;e ambition and neighbourhood had been fatal to

their grandeur, would not permit them to act up to their own ideas, and led them ha&s;tily to give the &s;an|ction of their approbation to the claim of the French king.</P>
<P>IT was equally the intere&s;t, and more in the power of Henry VIII. of England, to prevent either Fran|cis or Charles from acquiring a dignity which would rai&s;e them &s;o far above other monarchs. But though Henry often boa&s;ted, that he held the balance of Eu|rope in his hand, he had neither the &s;teady attention, the accurate di&s;cernment, nor the di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate temper which that delicate function required. On this occa&s;ion it mortified his vanity &s;o much, to &s;ee him&s;elf excluded from that noble competition which reflected &s;uch ho|nour upon the two antagoni&s;ts, that he took the re&s;o|lution of &s;ending an amba&s;&s;ador into Germany, and of declaring him&s;elf a candidate for the imperial throne. The amba&s;&s;ador, though loaded with care&s;&s;es by the German princes and the Pope's nuncio, informed his ma&s;ter, that he could hope for no &s;ucce&s;s in a claim which he had been &s;o late in preferring; and Henry, imputing his di&s;appointment to that circum&s;tance alone, and &s;oothed with this o&s;tentatious di&s;play of his own im|portance, &s;eems to have taken no farther part in the matter, either by contributing to thwart both his rivals, or to promote one of them <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Memoires de Fleuranges, 314. Herbert, Hi&s;t. of Henry VIII.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>LEO X, a pontiff no le&s;s renowned for his political abilities, than for his love of the arts, was the only prince of the age who ob&s;erved the motions of the two contending monarchs with a prudent attention, or who di&s;covered a proper &s;olicitude for the public &s;afety. The imperial and papal juri&s;diction interfered in &s;o ma|ny in&s;tances, the complaints of u&s;urpation were &s;o nu|merous on both &s;ides, and the territories of the church owed their &s;afety &s;o entirely to the weakne&s;s of their neighbours, and &s;o little to their, own force, that nothing was &s;o formidable to the court of Rome as an Empe|ror of exten&s;ive power, or of enterprizing genius. Leo trembled at the pro&s;pect of beholding the Imperial crown placed on the head of the king of Spain and of

Naples, and the ma&s;ter of the new world; nor was he le&s;s afraid of &s;eeing a king of France, who was duke of Milan, and lord of Genoa, exalted to that dignity. He foretold that the election of either of them would be fatal to the independence of the holy &s;ee, to the peace of Italy, and perhaps to the liberties of Europe. To oppo&s;e them, however, required addre&s;s and caution in proportion to the greatne&s;s of their power, and their opportunities of taking revenge. Leo was defective in neither. He &s;ecretly exhorted the German Princes to place one of their own number on the Imperial throne, which many of them were capable of filling with honour; he put them in mind of the con&s;titution by which the kings of Naples were for ever excluded from that dig|nity <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Golda&s;ti Con&s;titutiones Imperiales. Francof. 1673. vol. 1. 439.</NOTE>; he warmly exhorted the French king to per&s;i&s;t in his claim, not from any de&s;ire that he &s;hould gain his end, but as he fore&s;aw that the Germans would be more di&s;po&s;ed to favour the king of Spain, he hoped that Francis him&s;elf, when he di&s;covered his own chance of &s;ucce&s;s to be de&s;perate, would be &s;timulated by re|&s;entment and the &s;pirit of rival&s;hip, to concur with all his intere&s;t in rai&s;ing &s;ome third per&s;on to the head of the Empire; or on the other hand, if Francis &s;hould make unexpected progre&s;s, he did not doubt but that Charles would be induced by &s;imilar motives to act the &s;ame part; and thus by prudence and attention, the mutual jealou&s;y of the two rivals might be &s;o dextrou&s;ly managed, as to di&s;appoint both. But this &s;cheme, the only one which a prince in Leo's &s;ituation could adopt, though concerted with great wi&s;dom, was executed with little di&s;cretion. The French amba&s;&s;adors in Germany fed their ma&s;ter with vain hopes; the pope's nuncio be|ing gained by them, altogether forgot the in&s;tructions he had received; and Francis per&s;evered &s;o long and &s;o ob&s;tinately in urging his own preten&s;ions, as rendered all Leo's mea&s;ures abortive <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Guicciar. lib 13. 161.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SUCH were the hopes of the candidates, and the views of the different princes, when the diet was opened according to form at Frankfort, June 17th. The

right of chu&s;ing an Emperor had long been ve&s;ted in &s;even great princes, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Elec|tors, the origin of who&s;e office, and the nature and ex|tent of their powers, have already been explained. The&s;e were, at that time Albert of Brandenburgh, archbi&s;hop of Mentz; Herman count de Wied, archbi&s;hop of Co|logne; Richard de Greiffenklau, archbi&s;hop of Treves; Lewis, king of Bohemia; Lewis, count Palatin of the Rhine; Frederick, duke of Saxony; and Joachim I. marquis of Brandenburgh. Notwith&s;tanding the artful arguments produced by the amba&s;&s;adors of the two kings, in favour of their re&s;pective ma&s;ters, and in &s;pite of all their &s;olicitations, intrigues, and pre&s;ents, the E|lectors did not forget that maxim on which the liberty of the German con&s;titution was thought to be founded. Among the members of the Germanick body, which is a great republick compo&s;ed of &s;tates almo&s;t independent, the fir&s;t principle of patrioti&s;m is to depre&s;s and limit the power of the Emperor; and of this idea, &s;o natural under &s;uch a form of government, a German politician &s;eldom lo&s;es &s;ight. No prince of con&s;iderable power, or exten&s;ive dominions, had for &s;ome ages been rai&s;ed to the Imperial throne; and to this prudent precaution many of the great families in Germany owed the &s;plen|dor and independence which they had acquired during that period. To elect either of the contending mon|archs, would have been a gro&s;s violation of that &s;alutary maxim; would have given to the empire a ma&s;ter, in|&s;tead of an head; and would have reduced them&s;elves from the rank of equals, to the condition of &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>FULL of the&s;e ideas, they all turned their eyes to|wards Frederick, duke of Saxony, a prince of &s;uch emi|nent virtue, and abilities, as to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of the <HI>Sage,</HI> and with one voice offered him the Imperial crown. He was not dazzled with that object, which monarchs &s;o far &s;uperior to him in power courted with &s;uch eagerne&s;s; and after deliberating upon the matter a &s;hort time, he rejected it with a magnanimity and di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, no le&s;s &s;ingular than admirable. Nothing, he ob&s;erved, could be more impolitic, than an ob&s;tinate adherence to a maxim which, though &s;ound and ju&s;t in many ca&s;es, was not applicable to all. In

The Turki&s;h armies, led by a gallant and victorious monarch are now a&s;&s;embling. They are ready to pour in upon Germany with a violence unknown in former ages. New conjunctures call for new expedients. The imperial &s;ceptre mu&s;t be committed to &s;ome hand more powerful than mine, or that of any other German prince. We po&s;&s;e&s;s neither dominions, nor revenues, nor au|thority which enable us to encounter &s;uch a formidable enemy. Recour&s;e mu&s;t be had in this exigency to one of the rival monarchs. Each of them can bring into the field forces &s;ufficient for our defence. But as the King of Spain is of German extraction, as he is a member and prince of the empire by the territories which de|&s;cend to him from his grandfather; as his dominions &s;tretch along that frontier which lies mo&s;t expo&s;ed to the enemy; his claim is preferable, in my opinion, to that of a &s;tranger to our language, to our blood, and to our country; and therefore I give my vote to confer on him the Imperial crown.</P>

It remained to make a choice between the two great competitors. But be&s;ides the prejudice in Charles's favour ari&s;ing from his birth, and the &s;ituation of his German dominions, he owed not a little to the abilities of the cardinal de Gurk, and the zeal of Erard de la Mark, bi&s;hop of Liege, two of his amba&s;&s;adors who had conducted their negociations with more pru|dence and addre&s;s, than tho&s;e entru&s;ted by the French king. The former, who had long been the mini&s;ter and favourite of Maximilian, was well acquainted with the art of managing the Germans; and the latter having been di&s;appointed of a cardinal's hat by Francis, em|ployed all the malicious ingenuity with which the de&s;ire of revenge in&s;pires an ambitious mind, in thwarting the mea&s;ures of that monarch. The Spani&s;h party among the Electors daily gained ground; and the Pope's nuncio, being convinced that it was vain to make any farther oppo&s;ition, endeavoured to acquire &s;ome merit with the future Emperor, by offering voluntarily, in the name of his ma&s;ter, a di&s;pen&s;ation to hold the Imperial crown in conjunction with that of Naples <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Freheri.

<P>ON the twenty-eighth of June, five months and ten days after the death of Maximilian, this important con|te&s;t, which had held all Europe in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, was decided. Six of the Electors had already declared for the king of Spain, and the archbi&s;hop of Treves, the only firm ad|herent to the French intere&s;t, having at la&s;t joined his brethren, Charles was by the unanimous voice of the Electoral college rai&s;ed to the Imperial throne <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Jac Aug.

<P><PB N="22" REF="011837_0430_0F9D87A7F2F81C68">BUT though the Electors con&s;ented, from various motives, to promote Charles to that high &s;tation, they di&s;covered at the &s;ame time great jealou&s;y of his extra|ordinary power, and endeavoured, with the utmo&s;t &s;o|licitude, to provide again&s;t his encroaching on the pri|leges of the Germanick body. It had long been the cu&s;|tom to demand of every new Emperor a confirmation of the&s;e privileges, and to require a promi&s;e that he would never violate them in any in&s;tance. While princes who were formidable neither from extent of territory, nor of genius, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the imperial throne, a general and verbal engagement to this purpo&s;e was deemed &s;ufficient &s;ecu|rity. But under an Emperor &s;o powerful as Charles, other precautions &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary. A <HI>Capitulation,</HI> or claim of rights was formed, in which the privileges and immunities of the electors, of the princes of the empire, of the cities, and of every other member of the Germa|nick body are enumerated. This capitulation was im|mediately &s;igned by Charles's amba&s;&s;adors in the name of their ma&s;ter, and he him&s;elf at his coronation con|firmed it in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner. Since that period, the Electors have continued to pre&s;cribe the &s;ame con|ditions to all his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors; and in Germany the Capi|tulation or mutual contract between the emperor and his &s;ubjects, is con&s;idered as a &s;trong barrier again&s;t the progre&s;s of the imperial power, and as the great charter of their liberties to which they often appeal <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Pfeffel Abreg&egrave; de l'Hi&s;t. de Droit Publique d'Allemagne 590.

<P>THE important intelligence of his election was con|veyed in nine days from Frankfort to Barcelona, where Charles was &s;till detained by the ob&s;tinacy of the Cata|lonian Cortes, which had not hitherto brought to an i&s;|&s;ue any of the affairs that came before it.

ambition which renders the hi&s;tory of his reign &s;o wor|thy of attention.</P>
<P>A TRIVIAL circum&s;tance fir&s;t di&s;covered the effects of this great elevation upon the mind of Charles. In all the publick writs which he i&s;&s;ued as king of Spain, he a&s;&s;umed the title of <HI>Maje&s;ty,</HI> and required it from his &s;ubjects as a mark of their re&s;pect. Before that time, all the monarchs of Europe were &s;atisfied with the ap|pellation of <HI>Highne&s;s,</HI> or <HI>Grace;</HI> but the vanity of other courts &s;oon led them to imitate the example of the Spa|ni&s;h. The epithet of Maje&s;ty is no longer a mark of pre-eminence.

<P>THE Spaniards were far from viewing the promotion of their King to the Imperial throne with the &s;ame &s;atis|faction which he him&s;elf felt. To be deprived of the pre&s;ence of their &s;overeign, and to be &s;ubjected to the go|vernment of a vice-roy and his council, a &s;pecies of ad|mini&s;tration often oppre&s;&s;ive, and always di&s;agreeable, were the immediate and nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences of this new dignity. To &s;ee the blood of their countrymen &s;hed in quarrels wherein the nation had no concern, to behold its trea&s;ures wa&s;ted in &s;upporting the &s;plendour of a foreign title, and to be plunged in the chaos of Ita|lian and German politics, were effects of this event al|mo&s;t as unavoidable. From all the&s;e con&s;iderations, they concluded, that nothing could have happened more pernicious to the Spani&s;h nation; and the fortitude and publick &s;pirit of their ance&s;tors, who, in the Cortes of Ca&s;tile, prohibited Alfonzo the Wi&s;e from leaving the kingdom, in order to receive the Imperial crown, were often mentioned with the highe&s;t prai&s;e, and pronounced to be extremely worthy of imitation at this juncture <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Sandoval, i p. 32.

<P>BUT Charles, without regarding the &s;entiments or murmurs of his Spani&s;h &s;ubjects, accepted of the Impe|rial dignity which the count Palatine, at the head of a &s;olemn emba&s;&s;y, offered him in the name of the Elec|tors;

and declared his intention of &s;etting out &s;oon for Germany, in order to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. This was the more nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e, according to the forms of the German con&s;titution, he could not, before the cere|mony of a publick coronation, exerci&s;e any act of ju|ri&s;diction or authority <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Sabinus. P. Barre, viii. 1085.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THEIR certain knowledge of this re&s;olution aug|mented the di&s;gu&s;t of the Spaniards; and a &s;ullen and refractory &s;pirit prevailed among per&s;ons of all ranks. The Pope having granted the king the tenths of all ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical benefices in Ca&s;tile to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in carrying on war with greater vigour again&s;t the Turks, a convocation of the clergy unanimou&s;ly refu&s;ed to levy that &s;um, upon pretence that it ought never to be exacted but at tho&s;e times when Chri&s;tendom was actually invaded by the In|fidels; and though Leo, in order to &s;upport his autho|rity, laid the kingdom under an interdict, &s;o little re|gard was paid to a cen&s;ure which was univer&s;ally deem|ed unju&s;t, that Charles him&s;elf applied to have it taken off; and thus the Spani&s;h clergy, be&s;ides their merit in oppo&s;ing the u&s;urpations of the pope, and di&s;regarding the influence of the crown, gained the exemption which they had claimed <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">P. Martyr, Ep. 462. Ferreras viii. 473.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE commotions which aro&s;e in the kingdom of Va|lencia, annexed to the crown of Arragon, were more formidable, and produced more dangerous and la&s;ting effects. A &s;editious monk having by his &s;ermons ex|cited the citizens of Valencia, the capital city, to take arms, and to puni&s;h certain criminals in a tumultuary manner, the people, plea&s;ed with this excerci&s;e of pow|er, and with &s;uch a di&s;covery of their own importance, not only refu&s;ed to lay down their arms, but formed them&s;elves into troops and companies that they might be regularly trained to martial exerci&s;es. To obtain &s;ome &s;ecurity again&s;t the oppre&s;&s;ion of the Grandees was the motive of this a&s;&s;ociation, and proved a powerful bond of union; for as the ari&s;tocratical privileges and independence were more complete in Valencia than in any other of the Spani&s;h kingdoms, the nobles, being
<PB N="25" REF="011837_0433_0F9D87AA43D71010">
fearce accountable for their conduct to any &s;uperior, treated the people not only as va&s;&s;als but as &s;laves. They were alarmed, however, at the &s;ucce&s;s of this unexpect|ed in&s;urrection, as it might encourage the people to at|tempt &s;haking off the yoke; but as they could not re|pre&s;s them without taking arms, it became nece&s;&s;ary to have recour&s;e to the Emperor, and to de&s;ire his permi&s;|&s;ion to attack them, 1526. At the &s;ame time the peo|ple made choice of deputies to repre&s;ent their griev|ances, and to implore the protection of their &s;overeign. Happily for the latter, they arrived at court when Charles was exa&s;perated to an high degree again&s;t the nobles. As he was eager to vi&s;it Germany, where his pre&s;ence became every day more nece&s;&s;ary, and as his Flemi&s;h courtiers were &s;till more impatient to return in|to their native country, and to carry thither the &s;poils they had ama&s;&s;ed in Ca&s;tile, it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to hold the Cortes of Valencia in per&s;on. He had for that rea&s;on empowered the cardinal Adrian to repre&s;ent him in that a&s;&s;embly, and in his name to receive their oath of allegiance, to confirm their privileges with the u&s;ual &s;olemnities, and to demand of them a free gift. But the Valencian nobles, who con&s;idered this mea&s;ure as an indignity to their country, which was no le&s;s entitled, than his other kingdoms, to the honour of their &s;ove|reign's pre&s;ence, declared that by the fundamental laws of the con&s;titution they could neither acknowledge a per&s;on who was ab&s;ent as king, nor grant him any &s;ub|&s;idy, and to this declaration they adhered with an haugh|ty and inflexible ob&s;tinacy. Charles piqued by their behaviour, decided in favour of the people, and ra&s;hly authorized them to continue in arms. Their deputies returned in triumph, and were received by their fellow-citizens as the deliverers of their country; and the in&s;o|lence of the multitude increa&s;ing with their &s;ucce&s;s, they expelled all the nobles out of the city, committed the government to magi&s;trates of their own election, and en|tered into an a&s;&s;ociation di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>Germanada</HI> or <HI>Brotherhood,</HI> which proved the &s;ource not only of the wilde&s;t di&s;orders, but of the mo&s;t fatal cala|mities in that kingdom <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">P. Martyr. Ep. 651. Ferreras viii. 476, 485.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="011837_0434_0F9D87AAF3E09420">MEANWHILE, the kingdom of Ca&s;tile was agitated with no le&s;s violence. No &s;ooner was the Emperor's intention to leave Spain made known, than &s;everal cities of the fir&s;t rank re&s;olved to remon&s;trate again&s;t it, and to crave redre&s;s once more of tho&s;e grievances which they had formerly laid before him. Charles artfully avoided admitting their deputies to audience; and as he &s;aw from this circum&s;tance how difficult it would be at this juncture to re&s;train the mutinous &s;pirit of greater ci|ties, he &s;ummoned the Cortes of Ca&s;tile to meet at Com|po&s;tella in Galicia. His only rea&s;on for calling that a&s;|&s;embly, was the hope of obtaining another donative; for as his trea&s;ury had been exhau&s;ted in the &s;ame pro|portion that the riches of his mini&s;ters increa&s;ed, he could not, without &s;ome additional aid, appear in Ger|many with &s;plendour &s;uited to the Imperial dignity. To appoint a meeting of the Cortes in &s;o remote a pro|vince, and to demand a new &s;ub&s;idy before the time for paying the former was expired, were innovations of a mo&s;t dangerous tendency; and among people jealous of their liberties, and accu&s;tomed to &s;upply the wants of their &s;overeigns with a very frugal hand excited an univer&s;al alarm. The magi&s;trates of Toledo remon|&s;trated again&s;t both the&s;e mea&s;ures in a very high tone; the inhabitants of Valladolid, who expected that the Cortes &s;hould have been held in that city, were &s;o en|raged that they took arms in a tumultuary manner; and if Charles with his foreign coun&s;ellors had not fortunate|ly made their e&s;cape during a violent tempe&s;t, they would have ma&s;&s;acred all the Flemings, and have pre|vented him from continuing his journey towards Com|po&s;tella.</P>
<P>EVERY city through which they pa&s;&s;ed, petitioned again&s;t holding a Cortes in Galicia, a point with regard to which Charles was inflexible. But though the utmo&s;t influence had been exerted by the min&s;ters, in order to procure a choice of repre&s;entatives favourable to their de&s;igns, &s;uch was the temper of the nation, that at the opening of the a&s;&s;embly, April 1, there appeared among many of the members unu&s;ual &s;ymptoms of ill humour, which threatened a fierce oppo&s;ition to all the mea&s;ures of the court. No repre&s;entatives were &s;ent by Toledo,
<PB N="27" REF="011837_0435_0F9D87ABB1EC55A0">
for the lot, according to which, by ancient cu&s;tom, the election was determined in that city, having fallen upon two per&s;ons, devoted to the Flemi&s;h mini&s;ters, their fellow-citizens refu&s;ed to grant them a commi&s;&s;ion in the u&s;ual form, and in their &s;tead made choice of two deputies, whom they empowered to repair to Compo&s;|tella, and to prote&s;t again&s;t the lawfulne&s;s of the Cortes a&s;&s;embled there The repre&s;entatives of Salamanca re|fu&s;ed to take the u&s;ual oath of fidelity, unle&s;s Charles con&s;ented to change the place of meeting.

All the arts, however, which influence popular a&s;&s;emblies, bribes, promi&s;es, threats, and even force, were employed in order to gain the members. The nobles, &s;oothed by the re&s;pectful a&s;&s;iduity with which Chievres and the other Flemings paid court to them, or in&s;tigated by a mean jealou&s;y of that &s;pirit of independence which they &s;aw ri&s;ing among the commons, openly favoured the pre|ten&s;ions of the court, or at the utmo&s;t did not oppo&s;e them; and at la&s;t, in contempt both of the &s;entiments of the nation, and of the ancient forms of the con&s;titu|tion, a majority voted to grant the donative for which the Emperor had applied <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">P.

Together with this grant, the Cortes laid before Charles a repre&s;entation of tho&s;e grievances whereof his people craved redre&s;s; but he, having obtained from them all he could expect, paid no attention to this ill-timed petition, which it was no longer dangerous to di&s;regard <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Sandoval, 84.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AS nothing now retarded his embarkation, he di&s;|clo&s;ed his intention with regard to the regency of Ca&s;|tile during his ab&s;ence, which he had hitherto kept &s;e|cret, and nominated Cardinal Adrian to that office, The vice-royalty of Aragon he conferred on Don John de Lanuza; that of Valencia on Don Diego de Men|doza Con de Melito.

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE REIGN OF THE EMPEROR CHARLES V. BOOK II.</HEAD>
<P>MANY concurring circum&s;tances, not only called Charles's thoughts towards the affairs of Germany, but rendered his pre&s;ence in that country ne|ce&s;&s;ary. The Electors grew impatient of &s;o long an in|terregnum; his hereditary dominions were di&s;turbed by inte&s;tine commotions; and the new opinions concerning religion, made &s;uch rapid progre&s;s as required the mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration. But above all, the motions of the French king drew his attention, and convinced him that it was nece&s;&s;ary to take mea&s;ures for his own de|fence, both with &s;peed and with vigour.</P>
<P>WHEN Charles and Francis entered the li&s;ts as candi|dates for the Imperial dignity, they conducted their ri|val&s;hip with many profe&s;&s;ions of regard for each other, and with repeated declarations that they would not &s;uffer any tincture of enmity to mingle it&s;elf with this honour|able emulation. "We both court the &s;ame mi&s;tre&s;s," &s;aid Francis, with his u&s;ual vivacity, "each ought to urge his &s;uit with all the addre&s;s of which he is ma&s;ter, the mo&s;t fortunate will prevail, and the other mu&s;t re&s;t contented <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Guic. lib. 13 p. 159.</NOTE>." But though two young and high-&s;pirited
<PB N="30" REF="011837_0438_0F9D87ADF1071A08">
Princes, and each of them animated with the hope of &s;ucce&s;s, might be capable of forming &s;uch a generous re&s;olution, it was &s;oon found that they promi&s;ed upon a moderation too refined and di&s;intere&s;ted for human na|ture. The preference given to Charles in the &s;ight of all Europe, mortified Francis to the highe&s;t degree, and in&s;pired him with all the pa&s;&s;ions natural to di&s;appointed ambition. To this was owing the per&s;onal jealou&s;y and rival&s;hip which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the two monarchs during their whole reign; and the rancour of the&s;e, ad|ded to a real oppo&s;ition of intere&s;t, and to many una|voidable cau&s;es of di&s;cord, involved them in almo&s;t per|petual ho&s;tilities. Charles had paid no regard to the principal article in the treaty of Noyon, by refu&s;ing of|tener than once to do ju&s;tice to John d'Albret, the ex|cluded monarch of Navarre, whom Francis was bound in honour, and prompted by intere&s;t, to re&s;tore to his throne. The French king had preten&s;ions to the crown of Naples, of which Ferdinand had deprived his prede|ce&s;&s;or by a mo&s;t unju&s;tifiable breach of faith. The Em|peror might reclaim the dutchy of Milan as a fief of the empire, which Francis had &s;eized, and &s;till kept in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, without having received inve&s;titure. Charles con&s;idered the dutchy of Burgundy as the patrimonial domain of his ance&s;tors wre&s;ted from them by the un|ju&s;t policy of Lewis XI, and ob&s;erved with the greate&s;t jealou&s;y the &s;trict connections which Francis had formed with the duke of Gueldres, the hereditary enemy of his family.</P>
<P>WHEN the &s;ources of di&s;cord were &s;o many and va|rious, peace could be of no long continuance even be|tween Princes the mo&s;t exempt from ambition or emu|lation. But as the &s;hock between two &s;uch mighty an|tagoni&s;ts could not fail of being both de&s;perate and dan|gerous, they both di&s;covered no &s;mall &s;olicitude about its con&s;equences, and took time not only to collect, and to weigh their own &s;trength, and to compare it with that of their adver&s;ary, but to &s;ecure the friend&s;hip or a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the other European powers.</P>
<P>THE Pope had equal rea&s;on to dread the two rivals, and &s;aw that he who prevailed, would become ab&s;olute ma&s;ter in Italy. If it had been in his power to engage

them in ho&s;tilities, without rendering Lombardy the the|atre of war, nothing would have been more agreeable to him than to &s;ee them wa&s;te each other's &s;trength in endle&s;s quarrels; but this was impo&s;&s;ible. Leo fore&s;aw that on the fir&s;t rupture between the two monarchs, the armies of France and Spain would take the field in the Milane&s;e, and while the &s;cene of their operations was &s;o near, and the &s;ubject for which they contended &s;o inter|e&s;ting to him, he could not long remain neuter. He was obliged therefore to adapt his plan of conduct to his political &s;ituation. He courted and &s;oothed both the Emperor and King of France with equal indu&s;try and addre&s;s; and tho' warmly &s;olicited by each of them, he a&s;&s;umed all the appearances of entire impartiality, and attempted to conceal his real &s;entiments under that profound di&s;&s;imulation which &s;eems to have been affect|ed by mo&s;t of the Italian politicians in that age.</P>
<P>THE views and intere&s;t of the Venetians were not dif|ferent from tho&s;e of the Pope; nor were they le&s;s &s;olici|tous to prevent Italy from becoming the &s;eat of war, and their own republick from being involved in the quarrel. But thro' all Leo's artifices, and notwith&s;tanding his high preten&s;ions to a perfect neutrality, it was vi&s;ible that he leaned towards the Emperor, from whom he had both more to fear and more to hope than from Francis; and it was equally manife&s;t, that if it became nece&s;&s;ary to take a &s;ide, the Venetians would, from motives of the &s;ame nature, declare for the King of France. No con&s;iderable a&s;&s;i&s;tance, however, was to be expected from the Italian &s;tates, who were jealous to an extreme degree of the Tran&s;alpine powers, and careful to pre|&s;erve the balance between them, unle&s;s when they were &s;educed to violate this favourite maxim of their policy, by the certain pro&s;pect of great advantage to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>BUT the chief attention both of Charles and of Francis was employed in order to gain the king of Eng|land, from whom each of them expected a&s;&s;i&s;tance more effectual, and afforded with le&s;s political caution. Hen|ry VIII. had a&s;cended the throne of that kingdom in one thou&s;and five hundred and nine, with &s;uch circum|&s;tances of advantage, as promi&s;ed a reign of di&s;tingui&s;h|ed felicity and &s;plendour. The union in his per&s;on of
<PB N="32" REF="011837_0440_0F9D87AF9BA04BD0">
the two contending titles of York and Lanca&s;ter, and the alacrity and emulation with which both factions obeyed him, not only enabled him to exert in his dome&s;tic government a degree of vigour and authority which none of his predece&s;&s;ors could have &s;afely a&s;&s;um|ed; but permited him to take a &s;hare in the affairs of the continent, from which the attention of the Engli&s;h had long been diverted by their unhappy divi&s;ions. The immen&s;e trea&s;ures which his father had ama&s;&s;ed, ren|dered him the mo&s;t wealthy prince in Europe. The peace which had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted under the cautious admini&s;|tration of that monarch, was of &s;ufficient length to re|cruit the nation after the de&s;olation of the civil wars, but had not enervated its &s;pirit; and the Engli&s;h, a&s;hamed of having &s;o long rendered their own country a &s;cene of di&s;cord and blood&s;hed, were eager to di&s;play their valour in &s;ome foreign war, and to revive the memory of the victories gained by their ance&s;tors. Henry's own tem|per perfectly &s;uited the &s;tate of his kingdom, and the di&s;po&s;ition of his &s;ubjects. Ambitious, active, enter|prizing and accompli&s;hed in all the martial exerci&s;es which in that age formed a chief part in the education of per&s;ons of noble birth, and in&s;pired them with an early love of war, he longed to engage in real action, and to &s;ignalize the beginning of his reign by &s;ome re|markable exploit. An opportunity of this kind &s;oon pre&s;ented it&s;elf; and the victory at Guinegate, and the &s;ucce&s;sful &s;ieges of Tero&uuml;enne and Tournay, though of little utility to England, reflected great lu&s;tre on its monarch, and confirmed the idea which foreign princes entertained of his power and importance. So many concurring cau&s;es, added to the happy &s;ituation of his own dominions, which &s;ecured them from foreign in|va&s;ion; and to the fortunate circum&s;tance of his being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Calais, which &s;erved not only as a key to France, but opened an ea&s;y pa&s;&s;age into the Nether|lands, rendered the king of England the natural guardi|an of the liberties of Europe, and the arbiter between the Emperor and French monarch. Henry him&s;elf was &s;en&s;ible of this &s;ingular advantage, and convinced, that in order to pre&s;erve the balance even, it was his office to prevent either of the rivals from acquiring &s;uch
<PB N="33" REF="011837_0441_0F9D87B034AA50A8">
&s;uperiority of power as might be fatal to the other, and formidable to the re&s;t of Chri&s;tendom. But he was de&s;titute of the penetration, and &s;till more of the tem|per, which &s;uch a function required. Influenced by caprice, by vanity, by re&s;entment, by affection, he was incapable of forming any regular and exten&s;ive &s;y&s;tem of policy, or of adhering to it with &s;teadine&s;s. His mea&s;ures &s;eldom re&s;ulted from attention to the general welfare, or from a deliberate regard to his own intere&s;t, but were dictated by pa&s;&s;ions which rendered him blind to both, and prevented his gaining that a&s;cendant in the affairs of Europe, or from reaping &s;uch advantages to him&s;elf, as a prince of greater art, though with in|ferior talents, might have ea&s;ily &s;ecured.</P>
<P>ALL the impolitic &s;teps in Henry's admini&s;tration mu&s;t not, however, be imputed to defects in his own character; many of them were owing to the violent pa&s;&s;ions and in&s;atiable ambition of his prime mini&s;ter and favourite cardinal Wol&s;ey. This man, from one of the lowe&s;t ranks in life, had ri&s;en to an height of power and dignity, to which no Engli&s;h &s;ubject ever arrived; and governed the haughty, pre&s;umptuous and untractable &s;pirit of Henry with ab&s;olute authority. Great talents, and of very different kinds, fitted him for the two op|po&s;ite &s;tations of mini&s;ter, and of favourite. His pro|found judgment, his unwearied indu&s;try, his thorough acquaintance with the &s;tate of the kingdom, and his ex|ten&s;ive knowledge of the views and intere&s;ts of foreign courts, qualified him for that uncontrouled direction of affairs with which he was intru&s;ted. The elegance of his manners, the gaiety of his conver&s;ation, his in|&s;inuating addre&s;s, his love of magnificence, and his proficiency in tho&s;e parts or literature of which Henry was fond, gained him the affection and confidence of the young monarch. Wol&s;ey was far from employing this va&s;t and almo&s;t royal power, to promote either the true intere&s;t of the nation, or the real grandeur of his ma&s;ter. Rapacious at the &s;ame time, and profu&s;e, he was in&s;atiable in de&s;iring wealth. Of boundle&s;s ambi|tion, he a&s;pired after new honours with an eagerne&s;s unabated by his former &s;ucce&s;s; and being rendered pre&s;umptuous by his uncommon elevation, and the a&s;|cendant

By the&s;e arts, together with the grant of a large pen&s;ion, Francis &s;ecured the Cardinal, who per&s;uaded his ma&s;ter to &s;urrender Tour|nay to France, to conclude a treaty of marriage be|tween his daughter the prince&s;s Mary, and to con&s;ent to a per&s;onal interview with the French king <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Herbert's Hi&s;t. of Henry VIII. 30.

<P>CHARLES ob&s;erved the progre&s;s of this union with the utmo&s;t jealou&s;y and concern.

His chief &s;olicitude at pre&s;ent was to prevent the intended interview, the effects of which upon two young princes, who&s;e hearts were no le&s;s &s;u&s;ceptible of friend&s;hip than

their manners were of in&s;piring it, he exremely dreaded. But after many delays occa&s;ioned by difficulties about the ceremonial, and by the anxious precautions of both courts for the &s;afety of their re&s;pective &s;overeigns, the time and place of meeting were at la&s;t fixed. Me&s;&s;en|gers had been &s;ent to different courts inviting all comers, who were gentlemen, to enter the li&s;ts at tilt and tour|nament, again&s;t the two monarchs and their knights; and both Francis and Henry loved the &s;plendour of the&s;e &s;pectacles too well, and were too much delighted with the graceful figure they made on &s;uch occa&s;ions, to forego the plea&s;ure or glory which they expected from &s;uch a &s;ingular and brilliant a&s;&s;embly. Nor was the Cardinal le&s;s fond of di&s;playing his magnificence in the pre&s;ence of two courts, and of di&s;covering to the two nations the extent of his influence over both their mo|narchs. Charles finding it impo&s;&s;ible to prevent the interview, endeavoured to di&s;appoint its effects, and to pre-occupy the favour of the Engli&s;h monarch and his mini&s;ter by an act of complai&s;ance &s;till more flat|tering and more uncommon, having failed from Corun|na, as has already been related, he &s;teered his cour&s;e directly towards England, and relying wholly on Hen|ry's genero&s;ity for his own &s;afety, landed at Dover (May 26th.) This unexpected vi&s;it &s;urprized the nation. Wol&s;ey, however, was well acquainted with the Em|perors intention. A negociation, unknown to the hi&s;torians of that age, had been carried on between him and the court of Spain, this vi&s;it had been concerted, and Charles granted the Cardinal, whom he calls his <HI>mo&s;t &s;incere friend,</HI> an additional pen&s;ion of &s;even thou|&s;and ducats <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Rymer, xiii. 714.</NOTE>. Henry, who was then at Canterbury, in his way to France, immediately di&s;patched Wol&s;ey to Dover, and being highly plea&s;ed with an event &s;o &s;oothing to his vanity, ha&s;tened to receive, with &s;uit|able re&s;pect, a gue&s;t who had placed in him &s;uch un|bounded confidence. Charles, to whom time was pre|cious, &s;taid only four days in England: But during that &s;hort &s;pace, he had the addre&s;s not only to give Henry favourable impre&s;&s;ions of his character and in|tentions,
<PB N="36" REF="011837_0444_0F9D87B539DA93D0">
but to detach Wol&s;ey entirely from the in|tere&s;t of the French king. All the grandeur, wealth and power, which the Cardinal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, did not &s;atisfy his ambitious mind while there was &s;till one &s;tep high|er to which an eccle&s;ia&s;tic could a&s;cend. The papal dig|nity had for &s;ome time been the object of his wi&s;hes, and Francis as the mo&s;t effectual method of &s;ecuring his friend&s;hip, had promi&s;ed to favour his preten&s;ions, on the fir&s;t vacancy, with all his intere&s;t. But as the Emperor's influence in the college of cardinals was greatly &s;uperior to the French king's, Wol&s;ey gra&s;ped eagerly at an of|fer which that artful prince had made him of exerting it vigorou&s;ly in his behalf; and allured by this pro&s;pect, which under the pontificate of Leo, &s;till in the prime of his Life, was a very di&s;tant one, he entered with warmth into all the Emperor's &s;chemes. No treaty however, was concluded at that time, between the two monarchs; but Henry, in return for the honour which Charles had done him, promi&s;ed to vi&s;it him in &s;ome place of the Low Countries, immediately after taking leave of the French king.</P>
<P>HIS interview with that prince was in an open plain between Gui&s;nes and Ardres June 7th, where the two kings and their attendants di&s;played their magnificence with &s;uch emulation and profu&s;e expence, as procured it the name of the <HI>Field of the Cloth of Gold.</HI> Feats of chival|ry, parties of gallantry, and &s;uch excerci&s;es and pa&s;times as were in that age reckoned manly or elegant, rather than &s;erious bu&s;ine&s;s, occupied both courts during eighteen days that they continued together <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">The French and Engli&s;h hi&s;torians de&s;cribe the pomp of this inter|view, and the various &s;pectacles with great minutene&s;s.

the liberal and un&s;u&s;picious confidence with which he treated Henry, made on the mind of that monarch, was &s;oon effaced by Wol&s;ey's artifices, or by the interview which he had with the Emperor at Gravelines, (July 10) which was conducted by Charles with le&s;s pomp than that near Gui&s;ne&s;s, but with greater attention to his po|litical intere&s;t.</P>
<P>THIS a&s;&s;iduity with which the two greate&s;t monarchs in Europe paid court to Henry, appeared to him a plain acknowledgement that he held the balance in his hands, and convinced him of the ju&s;tne&s;s of the motto he had cho&s;en, "That whoever he favoured would cer|tainly prevail." In this opinion he was confirmed by an offer which Charles made of &s;ubmitting any difference that might ari&s;e between him and Francis to his &s;ole ar|bitration. Nothing could have the appearance of greater candour and moderation, than the choice of a judge who was reckoned the common friend of both.

It was the peculiar glory of that period to produce mo|narchs the mo&s;t illu&s;trious, that have at any one time appeared in Europe.

<P>THE fir&s;t act of the Emperor's admini&s;tration was to ap|point a Diet of the empire to be held at Worms on the &s;ixth of January, one thou&s;and five hundred and twenty-one; and in his circular letters to the different princes, he informed them that he had called this a&s;&s;embly in or|der to concert with them the mo&s;t proper mea&s;ures for checking the progre&s;s of tho&s;e new and dangerous opinions, which threatened to di&s;turb the peace of Ger|many, and to overturn the religion of their ance&s;tors.</P>

The interpo&s;ition of Heaven in fa|vour of the Chri&s;tian religion at its fir&s;t publication, was manife&s;ted by miracles and prophecies wrought and ut|tered in confirmation of it: And though none of the reformers po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, or pretended to po&s;&s;e&s;s, the&s;e &s;uper|natural gifts, yet that wonderful preparation of cir|cum&s;tances which di&s;po&s;ed the minds of men for re|ceiving their doctrines, that &s;ingular combination of cau&s;es which &s;ecured their &s;ucce&s;s, and enabled men de&s;titute of power and of policy to triumph over tho&s;e who employed both again&s;t them, may be con&s;idered as no &s;light proof that the &s;ame hand which planted the Chri&s;tian religion, protected the reformed faith, and reared it, from beginnings extremely feeble, to an amazing degree of &s;trength and maturity.</P>
<P>IT was from cau&s;es, &s;eemingly fortuitous, and from a &s;ource very incon&s;iderable, that all the mighty effects of the reformation flowed. Leo X. when rai&s;ed to the papal throne, found the revenues of the church ex|hau&s;ted by the va&s;t projects of his two ambitious prede|ce&s;&s;ors, Alexander VI. and Julius II; and his own tem|per, naturally liberal and enterprizing, rendered him in|capable of that &s;evere and patient oeconomy which the &s;ituation of his finances required. On the contrary, his &s;chemes for aggrandizing the family of Medici, his love of &s;plendour, his ta&s;te for plea&s;ure, and his magni|ficence in rewarding men of genius, involved him daily in new expences, in order to provide a fund for which, every device, that the fertile invention of prie&s;ts had fallen upon to drain the credulous multitude, was tried.

<P>The terms in which Tetzel and his a&s;&s;ociates de&s;cribed the benefits of Indulgences, and the nece&s;&s;ity of purcha&s;ing them are &s;o extravagant, that they appear to be almo&s;t incredible. If any man (&s;aid they) pur|cha&s;es letters of indulgence, his &s;oul may re&s;t &s;ecure with re&s;pect to its &s;alvation. The &s;ouls confined in purgatory, for who&s;e redemption in|dulgences are purcha&s;ed, as &s;oon as the money tinkles in the che&s;t, in|&s;tantly e&s;cape from that place of torment, and a&s;cend into heaven. That the efficacy of indulgences was &s;o great, that the mo&s;t heinous &s;ins, even if one &s;hould violate (which was impo&s;&s;ible) the Mother of God, would be remitted and expiated by them, and the per&s;on be freed both from puni&s;hment and guilt. That this was the un&s;peakable gift of God, in order to reconcile men to him&s;elf. That the cro&s;s erected by the preachers of indulgences, was as efficacious as the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t it&s;elf. Lo! the heavens are open; if you enter not now, when will you enter? For twelve-pence you may redeem the &s;oul of your Father out of purgatory; and are you &s;o ungrateful, that you will not re&s;cue your parent from torment? If you had but one coat, you ought to &s;trip your&s;elf in&s;tantly, and &s;ell it, in order to purcha&s;e &s;uch benefits, &amp;c.

<P><PB N="42" REF="011837_0450_0F9D87B871C5CA70">SUCH was the favourable juncture, and &s;o di&s;po&s;ed were the minds of his countrymen to li&s;ten to his di&s;|cour&s;es, when Martin Luther fir&s;t began to call in que&s;|tion the efficacy of Indulgences, and to declaim again&s;t the vicious lives and fal&s;e doctrines of tho&s;e who promul|gated them. He was a native of Ei&s;leben in Saxony, and though born of poor parents, had received a learned education, during the progre&s;s of which he gave many indications of uncommon vigour and acutene&s;s of ge|nius. As his mind was naturally &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;erious im|pre&s;&s;ions, and tinctured with &s;omewhat of that religious melancholy which delights in the &s;olitude and devotion of a mona&s;tic life, he retired into a convent of Augu&s;|tinian friars, and without &s;uffering the intreaties of his parents to divert him from what he thought his duty to God, he a&s;&s;umed the habit of that order. There he ac|quired great reputation, not only for piety, but for his love of knowledge, and unwearied application to &s;tu|dy. He had been taught the &s;chola&s;tic philo&s;ophy and theology which were then in vogue by very able ma&s;ters, and wanted not penetration to comprehend all the niceties and di&s;tinctions with which they abound; but his under&s;tanding, naturally &s;ound, and &s;uperior to every thing frivolous, &s;oon became di&s;gu&s;ted with the&s;e &s;ubtile and unin&s;tructive &s;ciences, and &s;ought for &s;ome more &s;olid foundation of knowledge and of piety in the holy &s;criptures. Having found a copy of the Bible, which lay neglected in the library of his mona&s;|tery, he abandoned all other pur&s;uits, and devoted him|&s;elf to the &s;tudy of it, with &s;uch eagerne&s;s and a&s;&s;iduity, as a&s;toni&s;hed the monks, who were little accu&s;tomed to derive their theological notions from that &s;ource. The great progre&s;s which he made in this uncommon cour&s;e of &s;tudy, augmented &s;o much the &s;ame both of his &s;anc|tity and of his learning, that Frederick, Elector of Sa|xony, having founded an univer&s;ity at Wittemberg on the Elbe, the place of his re&s;idence, Luther was cho&s;en fir&s;t to teach philo&s;ophy, and afterwards theology there, and di&s;charged both offices in &s;uch a manner, that he was deemed the chief ornament of that &s;ociety.</P>
<P>WHILE Luther was at the height of his reputation and authority, Tetzel began to publi&s;h Indulgences in
<PB N="43" REF="011837_0451_0F9D87B9322FCB28">
the neighbourhood of Wittemberg, and to a&s;cribe to them the &s;ame imaginary virtues, which had, in other places, impo&s;ed on the credulity of the people. As Sax|ony was not more enlightened than the other provinces of Germany, Tetzel met with prodigious &s;ucce&s;s there. It was with the utmo&s;t concern, that Luther beheld the artifices of tho&s;e who &s;old, and the &s;implicity of tho&s;e who bought, Indulgences. The opinions of Thomas Aquinas and the other &s;choolmen, on which the doc|trine of Indulgences was founded, had already lo&s;t much of their authority with him; and the &s;criptures, which he began to con&s;ider as the great &s;tandard of the|ological truth, afforded no countenance to a practice, equally &s;ubver&s;ive of faith and of morals. His warm and impetuous temper did not &s;uffer him long to con|ceal &s;uch important di&s;coveries, or to continue a &s;ilent &s;pectator of the delu&s;ion of his countrymen. From the pulpit in the great church of Wittemberg he inveighed bitterly again&s;t the irregularities and vices of tho&s;e who publi&s;hed Indulgences; he ventured to examine the doctrines which they taught, and pointed out to the people the danger of relying for &s;alvation upon any other means than tho&s;e appointed by God in his word. The boldne&s;s and novelty of the&s;e opinions drew great attention, and being recommended by the authority of Luther's per&s;onal character, and delivered with a popu|lar and per&s;ua&s;ive eloquence, they made a deep impre&s;|&s;ion on his hearers. Encouraged by the favourable re|ception of his doctrines among the people, he wrote to Albert, elector of Mentz, and archbi&s;hop of Magde|burg, to who&s;e juri&s;diction that part of Saxony was &s;ub|ject, and remon&s;trated warmly again&s;t the fal&s;e opinions and wicked lives of the preachers of Indulgences; but he found that prelate too deeply intere&s;ted in their &s;uc|ce&s;s to correct their abu&s;es. His next attempt was to gain the &s;uffrage of men of learning. For this purpo&s;e he publi&s;hed ninety-five the&s;es, containing his &s;enti|ments with regard to indulgences. The&s;e he propo&s;ed, not as points fully e&s;tabli&s;hed, or of undoubted certain|ty, but as &s;ubjects of inquiry and di&s;putation; he ap|pointed a day, on which the learned were invited to impugn them either in per&s;on, or by writing; and &s;ub|joined

<P>THE Friars of St. Augu&s;tine, Luther's own order, though addicted with no le&s;s ob&s;eqiou&s;ne&s;s than the o|ther mona&s;tic fraternities to the papal &s;ee, gave no check to the publication of the&s;e uncommon opinions. Luther had by his piety and learning acquired extra|ordinary authority among his brethren; he profe&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t regard for the authority of the Pope; his pro|fe&s;&s;ions were at that time &s;incere; and as a &s;ecret enmi|ty excited by intere&s;t and emulation, &s;ub&s;i&s;ts among all the mona&s;tic orders in the Romi&s;h church, the Augu&s;|tinians were highly plea&s;ed with his invectives again&s;t the Dominicans, and hoped to &s;ee them expo&s;ed to the hatred and &s;corn of the people. Nor was his &s;overeign the Elector of Saxony, the wi&s;e&s;t prince at that time in Germany, di&s;&s;atisfied with this ob&s;truction which Luther threw in the way of the publication of indulgences. He &s;ecretly encouraged the attempt, and flattered him&s;elf that this di&s;pute among the Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks them&s;elves, might give &s;ome check to the exactions of the court of Rome, which the &s;ecular princes had long though with|out &s;ucce&s;s, been endeavouring to oppo&s;e.</P>

That Arcemboldo, a Genoe&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;tic, who had been bred a merchant, and &s;till re|tained all the arts of that profe&s;&s;ion, was appointed by her to col|lect the money which &s;hould be rai&s;ed. F. Paul has followed him in both the&s;e particulars, and adds that the Augu&s;tinians in Sa|xony had been immemorially employed in preaching indulgences, but that Arcemboldo and his deputies, hoping to gain more by committing this tru&s;t to the Dominicans, had made their bar|gain with Tetzel, and that Luther was prompted at fir&s;t to oppo&s;e Tetzel and his a&s;&s;ociates, by a de&s;ire of taking revenge for this injury offered to his order. F. Paul, p. 5. Almo&s;t all the hi&s;to|rians &s;ince their time, popi&s;h as well as prote&s;tant, have, without examination, admitted the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions to be true upon their au|thority. But notwith&s;tanding the concurring te&s;timony of two au|thors &s;o eminent both for exactne&s;s and veracity, we may ob&s;erve, 1. That Felix Contolori who &s;earched the pontifical archives on purpo&s;e could not find this pretended grant in any of tho&s;e regi&s;|ters where it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have been recorded, Palav. p. 5.&mdash;2. That the profits ari&s;ing from Indulgences in Saxony and the adja|cent countries, had been granted not to Magdalen, but to Albert archbi&s;hop of Mentz, who had the right of nominating tho&s;e who publi&s;hed them. Seck. p. 12. Luth Oper. 1. praef. p. 1. Palav. p. 6.&mdash;3. That Arcemboldo never had concern in the publica|tion of Indulgences in Saxony his di&s;trict was Flanders and the Upper and Lower Rhine.

That Luther and his adherents never mention this grant of Leo's to his &s;i&s;ter, though a circum&s;tance of which they could &s;carce have been ignorant, and which they would have been careful not to &s;up|pre&s;s.&mdash;5. The publication of indulgences in Germany was not u&s;ually committed to the Augu&s;tinians. The promalgation of them at three different periods under Julius II. was granted to the Franci&s;cans; the Dominicans had been employed in the &s;ame of|fice a &s;hort time before the pre&s;ent period. Palav. p. 46. 6. The promulgation of tho&s;e Indulgences which fir&s;t excited Luther's in|dignation was entru&s;ted to the archbi&s;hop of Mentz in conjunc|tion with the guardian of the Franci&s;cans; but the latter having declined accepting of that tru&s;t, the &s;ole right became ve&s;ted in the archbi&s;hop.

<P><PB N="46" REF="011837_0454_0F9D87BB73B46F58">MEANWHILE, the&s;e novelties in Luther's doctrines which intere&s;ted all Germany, excited little attention and no alarm in the court of Rome. Leo, fond of ele|gant and refined plea&s;ures, intent upon great &s;chemes of policy, a &s;tranger to theological controver&s;ies, and apt to de&s;pi&s;e them, regarded with the utmo&s;t indif|ference the operations of an ob&s;cure Friar, who in the heart of Germany, carried on a &s;chola&s;tic di&s;putation in a barbarous &s;tile. Little did he apprehend, or Luther him&s;elf dream, that the effects of this quarrel would be &s;o fatal to the papal &s;ee. Leo imputed the whole to mona&s;tic enmity an emulation, and &s;eemed inclined not to interpo&s;e in the conte&s;t, but to allow the Au|gu&s;tinians and Dominicans to wrangle about the matter with their u&s;ual animo&s;ity.</P>
<P>THE &s;olicitations, however, of Luther's adver&s;aries, exa&s;perated to an high degree by the boldne&s;s and &s;eve|rity with which he animadverted on their writings, to|gether with the &s;urprizing progre&s;s which his opinions made in different parts of Germany, rouzed at la&s;t the attention of the court of Rome, and obliged Leo to take mea&s;ures for the &s;ecurity of the church again&s;t an attack that appeared now too &s;erious to be de&s;pi&s;ed. For this end, he &s;ummoned Luther to appear at Rome, within &s;ixty days, before the auditor of the chamber, and the &s;ame Prierias who had written again&s;t him, whom he empowred to examine his doctrines, and to
<PB N="47" REF="011837_0455_0F9D87BC30391F90">
decide concerning them. He wrote at the &s;ame time, to the Elector of Saxony, be&s;eeching him not to pro|tect a man who&s;e heretical and profane tenets were &s;o &s;hocking to pious ears; and enjoined the Provincial of the Augu&s;tinians to check by his authority the ra&s;hne&s;s of an arrogant monk, which brought di&s;grace upon the order of St. Augu&s;tine, and gave offence and di&s;turbance to the whole church.</P>
<P>FROM the &s;train of the&s;e letters as well as from the nomination of a judge &s;o prejudiced and partial as Prierias, Luther ea&s;ily &s;aw what &s;entence he might expect at Rome. He di&s;covered, for that rea&s;on, the utmo&s;t &s;olicitude, to have his cau&s;e tried in Germany, and before a le&s;s &s;u&s;pected tribunal. The univer&s;ity of Wittemberg, anxious for the &s;afety of a man who did &s;o much honour to their &s;ociety, wrote to the Pope, and after employing &s;everal pretexts to excu&s;e Luther from appearing at Rome, intreated Leo to commit the exami|nation of his doctrines to &s;ome per&s;ons of learning and authority in Germany. The Elector reque&s;ted the &s;ame thing of the Pope's legate at the diet of Aug&s;burg; and as Luther him&s;elf, who, at that time, was &s;o far from having any intention to di&s;claim the papal authority, that he did not even entertain the &s;malle&s;t &s;u&s;picion concern|ing its divine original, had written to Leo a mo&s;t &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive letter, promi&s;ing an unre&s;erved compliance with his will, the Pope gratified them &s;o far as to em|power his legate in Germany, cardinal Cajetan, a Domi|nican, eminent for &s;chola&s;tic learning, and pa&s;&s;ionately de|voted to the Roman &s;ee, to hear and determine the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>LUTHER, though he had good rea&s;on to decline a judge cho&s;en among his avowed adver&s;aries, did not he|&s;itate about appearing before Cajetan, and having ob|tained the Emperor's &s;afe-conduct, immediately repaired to Aug&s;burg. The Cardinal received him with decent re&s;pect, and endeavoured at fir&s;t to gain upon him by gentle treatment: But thinking it beneath the dignity of his &s;tation to enter into any formal di&s;pute, he re|quired him, by virtue of the apo&s;tolic powers with which he was cloathed, to retract the errors he had uttered with regard to Indulgences, and the nature of faith; and to ab&s;tain, for the future, from the publication of new
<PB N="48" REF="011837_0456_0F9D87BDD8491A20">
and dangerous opinions. Luther fully per&s;uaded of the truth of his own tenets, and confirmed in the belief of them by the approbation they had met with among per&s;ons con&s;picuous both for their learning and piety, was &s;urprized at this abrupt mention of a recantation be|fore any endeavours were u&s;ed to convince him that he was mi&s;taken. He had flattered him&s;elf, that in a con|ference concerning the points in di&s;pute, with a prelate of &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hed abilities, he would be able to re|move many of tho&s;e imputations with which the igno|rance or malice of his antagoni&s;ts had loaded him; but the high tone of authority which the Cardinal a&s;&s;umed, extingui&s;hed at once all hopes of this kind, and cut off every pro&s;pect of advantage from the interview. His native intrepidity of mind, however, did not de&s;ert him. He declared, with the utmo&s;t firmne&s;s, that he could not, with a &s;afe con&s;cience, renounce opinions which he believed to be true; nor &s;hould any con&s;ideration ever induce him to do what would be &s;o ba&s;e in it&s;elf, and &s;o offen&s;ive to God. At the &s;ame time he continued to ex|pre&s;s no le&s;s reverence than formerly for the authority of the apo&s;tolic &s;ee <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Luth. Oper. vol. i. p. 164.</NOTE>; he &s;ignified his willingne&s;s to &s;ub|mit the whole controver&s;y to certain univer&s;ities which he named, and promi&s;ed neither to write nor to preach for the future concerning Indulgences, provided his ad|ver&s;aries were likewi&s;e enjoined to be &s;ilent with re&s;pect to them <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 169.</NOTE>. All the&s;e offers Cajetan di&s;regarded or re|jected, and &s;till in&s;i&s;ted peremptorily on a &s;imple re|cantation, threatening him with eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ures, and forbidding him to appear again in his pre&s;ence, un|le&s;s he re&s;olved in&s;tantly to comply with what he requir|ed. This haughty and violent manner of proceeding, as well as other circum&s;tances, gave Luther's friends &s;uch &s;trong rea&s;ons to &s;u&s;pect, that even the Imperial &s;afe-conduct would not be able to protect him from the legate's power and re&s;entment, that they prevailed on him to withdraw &s;ecretly from Aug&s;burg, and to return to his own country. But before his departure, accord|ing to a form of which there had been &s;ome examples, he prepared a &s;olemn appeal, from the Pope ill-inform|ed

<P>CAJETAN, enraged at Luther's abrupt retreat, and the publication of his appeal, wrote to the Elector of Saxony, complaining of both; and requiring him, as he regarded the peace of the church, or the authority of its head, either to &s;end that &s;editious monk a pri&s;oner to Rome, or to bani&s;h him out of his territories. It was not from theological con&s;iderations that Frederick had hitherto countenanced Luther, he &s;eems to have been much a &s;tranger to controver&s;ies of that kind, and to have been little intere&s;ted in them. His protection flowed almo&s;t entirely, as hath been already ob&s;erved, from political motives, and was afforded with great &s;ecrecy and caution.

condemned him as an heretick <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Luth. Oper. i. 161.</NOTE>.

<P>LUTHER's &s;ituation, meanwhile, was &s;uch as would have filled any other per&s;on with the mo&s;t di&s;quieting apprehen&s;ions. He could not expect that a prince &s;o prudent and cautious as Frederick would, on his ac|count, &s;et at defiance the thunders of the church, and brave the papal power which had cru&s;hed &s;ome of the mo&s;t powerful of the German Emperors. He knew what veneration was paid, at that time, to eccle&s;ia&s;tical deci&s;ions; what terror eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ures carried a|long with them, and how ea&s;ily the&s;e might intimidate and &s;hake a prince, who was rather his protector from policy, than his di&s;ciple from conviction.

<P>BUT as every &s;tep taken by the court of Rome, par|ticularly the irregular &s;entence by which he had been &s;o precipitately declared an heretick, convinced Luther that Leo would &s;oon proceed to the mo&s;t violent mea|&s;ures again&s;t him, he had recour&s;e to the only expedi|ent in his power, in order to prevent the effect of the Papal cen&s;ures. He appealed to a general council, which he affirmed to be the repre&s;entative of the catho|lic church, and &s;uperior in power to the Pope, who being a fallible man, might err, as St. Peter, the mo&s;t perfect of his predece&s;&s;ors had erred <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Sleid.

<P><PB N="51" REF="011837_0459_0F9D87BFF25740B8">IT &s;oon appeared, that Luther had not formed ra&s;h conjectures concerning the intentions of the Romi&s;h church. A bull of a date prior to his appeal, was i&s;|&s;ued by the Pope, in which he magnifies the virtue and efficacy of Indulgences in terms as extravagant as any of his predece&s;&s;ors had ventured to u&s;e in the darke&s;t ages; and without applying &s;uch palliatives, or men|tioning &s;uch conce&s;&s;ions as the juncture &s;eemed to call for, he required all Chri&s;tians to a&s;&s;ent to what he de|livered as the doctrine of the catholic church, and &s;ub|jected tho&s;e who &s;hould hold or teach any contrary opinion to the heavie&s;t eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ures.</P>
<P>AMONG Luther's followers, this bull, which they con&s;idered as an unju&s;tifiable effort of the Pope in or|der to pre&s;erve that rich branch of his revenue which aro&s;e from Indulgences, produced little effect. But among the re&s;t of his countrymen, &s;uch a clear deci&s;ion of the &s;overeign Pontiff again&s;t him, and inforced by &s;uch dreadful penalties, mu&s;t have been attended with con&s;e|quences very fatal to his cau&s;e; if the&s;e had not been prevented in a great mea&s;ure by the death of the Empe|ror Maximilian, whom both his principles and his in|tere&s;t prompted to &s;upport the authority of the holy &s;ee. In con&s;equence of this event, the vicariat of that part of Germany which is governed by the Saxon laws, was committed to the Elector of Saxony; and under the &s;helter of his friendly admini&s;tration, Luther not only enjoyed tranquillity, but his opinions were &s;uffer|ed, during the inter-regnum which preceded Charles's election, to take root in different places, and to grow up to &s;ome degree of &s;trength and firmne&s;s. Leo too, to whom the election of an Emperor was a point more intere&s;ting than a theological controver&s;y, which he did not under&s;tand, and of which he could not fore&s;ee the con&s;equences, being extremely &s;olicitous not to irritate a Prince of &s;uch con&s;iderable influence in the electoral college as Frederick, di&s;covered a great unwillingne&s;s to pronounce the &s;entence of excommunication again&s;t Luther, which his adver&s;aries continually demanded with the mo&s;t clamorous importunity.</P>

the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of any further proceedings again&s;t Luther for eighteen months. Perpetual negociations, however, in order to bring the matter to &s;ome amicable i&s;&s;ue, were carried on during that &s;pace. The manner in which the&s;e were conducted having given Luther many opportunities of ob&s;erving the corruption of the court of Rome; its ob&s;tinacy in adhering to e&s;tabli&s;hed errors; and its indifference about truth, however clearly pro|po&s;ed, or &s;trongly proved, he began to utter &s;ome doubts with regard to the divine original of the Papal autho|rity. A publick di&s;putation was held upon this im|portant que&s;tion at Leip&s;ic, between Luther and Ec|cius, one of his mo&s;t learned and formidable antagoni&s;ts; but it was as fruitle&s;s and indeci&s;ive as &s;uch &s;chola&s;tic combats u&s;ually prove.

The Franci&s;cans being entru&s;ted with the promulgation of Indulgences in that country, executed their commi&s;&s;ion with the &s;ame indi&s;cretion and rapaci|ou&s;ne&s;s, which had rendered the Dominicans &s;o odious in Germany.

The appearance of &s;uch a vigorous auxiliary, and the progre&s;s which he made, was at fir&s;t, matter of great joy to Luther, though on the other hand, the decrees of the univer&s;ities of Co|logne and Louvain, which pronounced his opinions to be erroneous, afforded great cau&s;e of triumph to his adver&s;aries.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="011837_0461_0F9D87C3AEB45838">BUT the undaunted &s;pirit of Luther acquired fre&s;h vigour from every in&s;tance of oppo&s;ition; and pu&s;hing on his inquiries and attacks from one doctrine to ano|ther he began to &s;hake the firme&s;t foundations on which the wealth or power of the church were e&s;tabli&s;hed.

<P>THE publication of this bull in Germany excited various pa&s;&s;ions in different places. Luther's adver|&s;aries exulted, as if his party and opinions had been cru&s;hed at once by &s;uch a deci&s;ive blow. His followers, who&s;e reverence for the papal authority daily dimini&s;hed,

read Leo's anathemas with more indignation than ter|ror. In &s;ome cities, the people violently ob&s;tructed the promulgation of the bull; in others, tho&s;e who attemp|ted to publi&s;h it were in&s;ulted, and the bull it&s;elf torn in pieces, and trodden under foot <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Seck. p. 116.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS &s;entence, which he had for &s;ome time expected, did not di&s;concert or intimidate Luther. After renew|ing his appeal to a general council, he publi&s;hed re|marks upon the bull of excommunication; and being now per&s;uaded that Leo had been guilty both of im|piety and inju&s;tice in his proceedings again&s;t him, he boldly declared the Pope to be that man of &s;in, or An|tichri&s;t, who&s;e appearance is foretold in the New Te&s;|tament; he declaimed again&s;t his tyranny and u&s;urpa|tions with greater violence than ever; he exhorted all Chri&s;tian Princes to &s;hake of &s;uch an ignominious yoke; and boa&s;ted of his own happine&s;s in being marked out as the object of eccle&s;ia&s;tical indignation, becau&s;e he had ventured to a&s;&s;ert the liberty of mankind. Nor did he confine his expre&s;&s;ions of contempt for the papal power to words alone; Leo having, in execution of the bull, appointed Luther's books to be burnt at Rome, he, by way of retaliation, a&s;&s;embled all the profe&s;&s;ors and &s;tudents in the univer&s;ity of Wittemberg, and with great pomp, and before a va&s;t multitude of &s;pectators, ca&s;t the vo|lumes of the canon law together with the bull of excom|munication into the flames; and his example was imi|tated in &s;everal cities of Germany. The manner in which he ju&s;tified this action was &s;till more provoking than the action it&s;elf. He collected from the canon law &s;ome of the mo&s;t extravagant propo&s;itions with re|gard to the plenitude and omnipotence of the Pope's power, and &s;ubordination of all &s;ecular juri&s;diction to his authority, and publi&s;hed the&s;e with a commen|tary, pointing out the impiety of &s;uch tenets, and their evident tendency to &s;ubvert all civil government <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Luth Oper. ii. 316.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SUCH was the progre&s;s which Luther had made, and &s;uch the &s;tate of his party, when Charles arrived in Germany. No &s;ecular Prince had hitherto embraced Luther's opinions, no change in the e&s;tabli&s;hed forms of

wor&s;hip had been introduced; and no encroachments made upon the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions or juri&s;diction of the clergy; neither party had yet proceeded to action; and the con|trover&s;y, though conducted with great heat and pa&s;&s;ion on both &s;ides, was &s;till carried on with its proper weap|ons, with the&s;es, di&s;putations, and replies. A deep impre&s;&s;ion, however, was made upon the minds of the people; their reverence for ancient in&s;titutions and doc|trines was &s;haken; and the materials were already &s;cat|tered which produced the combu&s;tion that &s;oon &s;pread all over Germany. Students crowded from every pro|vince of the Empire to Wittemberg; and under Lu|ther him&s;elf, Melancthon, Carlo&s;tadius, and other ma&s;|ters, then reckoned eminent, imbibed opinions, which, on their return, they propagated among their country|men, who li&s;tened to them with that fond attention, which truth, when accompanied with novelty, naturally commands <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Seckend. 59.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DURING the cour&s;e of the&s;e tran&s;actions, the court of Rome, though under the direction of one of its able&s;t Pontiffs, neither formed its &s;chemes with that profound &s;agacity, nor executed them with that &s;teady per&s;eve|rance, which had long rendered it the mo&s;t perfect mo|del of political wi&s;dom to the re&s;t of Europe. When Luther began to declaim again&s;t Indulgences, two dif|ferent methods of treating him lay before the Pope; by adopting one of which the attempt, it is probable, might have been cru&s;hed, and by the other it might have been rendered innocent. If Luther's fir&s;t departure from the doctrines of the church had in&s;tantly drawn upon him the weight of its cen&s;ures, the dread of the&s;e might have re&s;trained the Elector of Saxony from protecting him, might have deterred the people from li&s;tening to his di&s;cour&s;es, or have over-awed Luther him&s;elf; and his name, like that of many good men before his time, would now have been known to the world only for his hone&s;t but ill-timed effort to correct the corruptions of the Romi&s;h church. Or on the other hand, if the Pope had early te&s;tified &s;ome di&s;plea&s;ure with the vices and exce&s;&s;es of tho&s;e who had been employed to publi&s;h In|dulgences;
<PB N="56" REF="011837_0464_0F9D87C53253BA60">
if he had forbidden the mentioning of con|troverted points in di&s;cour&s;es, addre&s;&s;ed to the people; if he had enjoined the di&s;putants on both &s;ides to be &s;i|lent; if he had been careful not to ri&s;que the credit of the church by defining articles which had hitherto been left undetermined, Luther would, probably, have &s;topt &s;hort at his fir&s;t di&s;coveries: He would not have been forced in &s;elf-defence to venture upon new ground, and the whole controver&s;y might po&s;&s;ibly have died away in|&s;en&s;ibly; or being confined entirely to the &s;chools, might have been carried on with as little detriment to the peace and unity of the Romi&s;h church, as that which the Franci&s;cans maintain with the Dominicans, concern|ing the immaculate conception, or that between the Jan&s;eni&s;ts and Je&s;uits concerning the operations of grace: But Leo, by fluctuating between the&s;e oppo&s;ite &s;y&s;tems, and by embracing them alternately, defeated the effects of both. By an improper exertion of authority, Luther was exa&s;perated, not re&s;trained. By a mi&s;taken exerci&s;e of lenity, time was given for his opinions to &s;pread, but no progre&s;s made towards reconciling him to the church; and even the &s;entence of excommunication, which at another juncture might have been deci&s;ive, was delayed &s;o long, that it became at la&s;t &s;carce an object of terror.</P>
<P>SUCH a &s;eries of errors in the mea&s;ure of a court, &s;eldom chargeable with mi&s;taking its own true intere&s;t, is not more a&s;toni&s;hing than the wi&s;dom which appeared in Luther's conduct. Though a perfect &s;tranger to the maxims of human prudence, and incapable, from the impetuo&s;ity of his temper, of ob&s;erving them, he was led naturally by the method in which he made his di&s;|coveries, to carry on his operations in a manner which contributed more to their &s;ucce&s;s, than if every &s;tep he took had been pre&s;cribed by the mo&s;t artful policy. At the time when he &s;et him&s;elf to oppo&s;e Tetzel, he was far from intending that reformation, which he afterwards effected; and would have trembled with horror at the thoughts of what at la&s;t he gloried in accompli&s;hing. The knowledge of truth was not poured into his mind, all at once, by any &s;pecial revelation; he acquired it by indu&s;try and meditation, and his progre&s;s, of con&s;e|quence,
<PB N="57" REF="011837_0465_0F9D87C5F08A9708">
was gradual. The doctrines of Popery are &s;o clo&s;ely connected, that the expo&s;ing of one error con|ducted him naturally to the detection of others; and all the parts of that artificial fabrick were &s;o linked together, that the pulling down of one loo&s;ened the foundation of the re&s;t, and rendered it more ea&s;y to overturn them. In confuting the extravagant tenets concerning Indul|gences, he was obliged to inquire into the true cau&s;e of our ju&s;tification and acceptance with God. The know|ledge of that di&s;covered to him by degrees the inutility of pilgrimages and penances; the vanity of relying on the interce&s;&s;ion of &s;aints; the impiety of wor&s;hipping them; the abu&s;es of auricular confe&s;&s;ion; and the ima|ginary exi&s;tence of purgatory. The detection of &s;o many errors, led him of cour&s;e to con&s;ider the charac|ter of the clergy who taught them; and their exorbi|tant wealth, the &s;evere injunction of celibacy, and the intolerable rigour of mona&s;tic vows appeared to him the great &s;ources of their corruption. From thence, it was but one &s;tep to call in que&s;tion the divine original of the papal power, which authorized and &s;upported &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of errors. As the unavoidable re&s;ult of the whole, he di&s;claimed the infallibility of the Pope, the deci&s;ions of &s;choolmen, or any other human authority, and appealed to the word of God as the only &s;tandard of theological truth. To this gradual progre&s;s Luther owed his &s;ucce&s;s. His hearers were not &s;hocked at fir&s;t by any propo&s;ition too repugnant to their ancient pre|judices, or too remote from e&s;tabli&s;hed opinions. They were conducted in&s;en&s;ibly from one doctrine to another. Their faith and conviction were able to keep pace with his di&s;coveries. To the &s;ame cau&s;e was owing the inat|tention, and even indifference, with which Leo viewed Luther's fir&s;t proceedings. A direct or violent attack upon the authority of the church, would have drawn upon him at once the whole weight of its vengeance; but as this was far from his thoughts, as he continued long to profe&s;s great re&s;pect for the Pope, and made re|peated offers of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his deci&s;ions, there &s;eem|ed to be no rea&s;on for apprehending that he would prove the author of any de&s;perate revolt; and he was &s;uffered to proceed &s;tep by &s;tep, in undermining the con&s;titution
<PB N="58" REF="011837_0466_0F9D87C6B7385E28">
of the church, till the remedy applied at la&s;t came too late to produce any effect.</P>
<P>BUT whatever advantages Luther's cau&s;e derived ei|ther from the mi&s;takes of his adver&s;aries, or from his own good conduct, the &s;udden progre&s;s and firm e&s;tab|li&s;hment of his doctrines, mu&s;t not be a&s;cribed to the&s;e alone. The &s;ame corruptions in the church of Rome which he condemned, had been attacked long before his appearance, and the &s;ame opinions which he now propagated, had been publi&s;hed in different places, and were &s;upported by the &s;ame arguments. Waldus in the twelfth century, Wickliff in the fourteenth, and Hu&s;s in the fifteenth, had inveighed again&s;t the errors of Po|pery with great boldne&s;s, and confuted them with more ingenuity and learning than could have been expected in tho&s;e illiterate ages in which they flouri&s;hed. But all the&s;e premature attempts towards a reformation proved abortive. Such feeble lights, incapable of di&s;pelling the darkne&s;s which then covered the church, were &s;oon extingui&s;hed; and though the doctrines of the&s;e pious men produced &s;ome effects, and left &s;ome traces in the countries where they were taught, they were neither ex|ten&s;ive nor con&s;iderable. Many powerful cau&s;es con|tributed to facilitate Luther's progre&s;s, which either did not exi&s;t or did not operate with full force in their days; and at the critical and mature juncture when he ap|peared, circum&s;tances of every kind concurred in ren|dering each &s;tep he took &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>THE long and &s;candalous &s;chi&s;m which divided the church, during the latter part of the fourteenth, and the beginning of the fifteenth centuries, had a great ef|fect in dimini&s;hing the veneration with which the world had been accu&s;tomed to view the papal dignity. Two or three contending Pontiffs roaming about Europe at a time; fawning on the Princes whom they wanted to gain; &s;queezing the countries which acknowledged their authority; excommunicating their rivals, and cur&s;ing tho&s;e who adhered to them, di&s;credited their preten&s;ions to infallibility, and expo&s;ed both their per&s;ons and their office to contempt. The laity, to whom all parties ap|pealed, came to learn that &s;ome right of private judg|ment belonged to them, and acquired the exerci&s;e of it
<PB N="59" REF="011837_0467_0F9D87C7738B8E80">
&s;o far as to choo&s;e, among the&s;e infallible guides, whom they would plea&s;e to follow. The proceedings of the councils of Con&s;tance and Ba&s;il, &s;pread &s;till wider this di&s;re&s;pect for the Romi&s;h &s;ee, and by their bold exer|tion of authority in depo&s;ing and electing Popes, taught the world that there was in the church a juri&s;diction &s;u|perior even to the papal power, which they had long believed to be &s;upreme.</P>
<P>THE wound given on that occa&s;ion to the papal au|thority was &s;carce healed up, when the pontificates of Alexander VI. and Julius II. both able princes, but de|te&s;table eccle&s;ia&s;tics, rai&s;ed new &s;candal in Chri&s;tendom. The profligate morals of the former in private life; the fraud, the inju&s;tice and cruelty of his publick admini&s;|tration, placed him on a level with tho&s;e tyrants, who&s;e deeds are the greate&s;t reproach to human nature. The latter, though a &s;tranger to the&s;e odious pa&s;&s;ions which prompted his predece&s;&s;or to commit &s;o many unnatural crimes, was under the dominion of a re&s;tle&s;s and ungo|vernable ambition, which &s;corned all con&s;iderations of gratitude, of decency, or of ju&s;tice, when they ob&s;truct|ed the execution of his &s;chemes. It was &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to be firmly per&s;uaded that the infallible knowledge of a religion, who&s;e chief precepts are purity and humili|ty, was depo&s;ited in the brea&s;ts of the impious Alexan|der, or the overbearing Julius.

great &s;candal, not only becau&s;e their manners were in|con&s;i&s;tent with their &s;acred character; but the laity being accu&s;tomed to &s;ee &s;everal of them rai&s;ed from the low|e&s;t &s;tations to the greate&s;t affluence, did not &s;hew the &s;ame indulgence to their exce&s;&s;es, as to tho&s;e of per&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of hereditary wealth or grandeur; and viewing their condition with more envy, they cen&s;ured their crimes with greater &s;everity. Nothing, therefore, could be more acceptable to Luther's hearers, than the violence with which he exclaimed again&s;t the immoralities of churchmen, and every per&s;on in his audience could, from his own own ob&s;ervation, confirm the truth of his invectives.</P>
<P>THE &s;candal of the&s;e crimes was greatly increa&s;ed by the facility with which tho&s;e who committed them, ob|tained pardon. In all the European kingdoms, the im|potence of the civil magi&s;trate, under forms of govern|ment extremely irregular and turbulent, made it nece&s;|&s;ary to relax the rigour of ju&s;tice, and upon payment of a certain fine or compo&s;ition pre&s;cribed by law, to remit farther puni&s;hment, even of the mo&s;t atrocious crimes. The court of Rome, always attentive to the means of augmenting its revenues, imitated this prac|tice, and by a prepo&s;terous accommodation of it to re|ligious concerns, granted its pardons to &s;uch tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ors as gave a &s;um of money in order to purcha&s;e them. As the idea of a compo&s;ition for crimes was then fami|liar, this &s;trange traffick was &s;o far from &s;hocking man|kind, that it &s;oon became general; and to prevent any impo&s;ition in carrying it on, the officers, of the Roman chancery publi&s;hed a book, containing the preci&s;e &s;um to be exacted for the pardon of every particular &s;in. A deacon guilty of murder was ab&s;olved for twenty crowns. A bi&s;hop or abbot might a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate for three hundred livres. Any eccle&s;ia&s;tic might commit uncleanne&s;s, though with the mo&s;t aggravating circum&s;tances, for the third part of that &s;um. Even &s;uch &s;hocking crimes, as occur &s;eldom in human life, and perhaps exi&s;t only in the impure imagination of a ca&s;ui&s;t, were taxed at a ve|ry moderate rate. When a more regular and perfect mode of di&s;pen&s;ing ju&s;tice came to be introduced into civil courts, the practice of paying a compo&s;ition for

crimes went gradually into di&s;u&s;e; and mankind having acquired more accurate notions concerning religion and morality, the conditions on which the court of Rome be&s;towed its pardons appeared impious, and were con|&s;idered as one great &s;ource of eccle&s;ia&s;tical corruption <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Fa&s;cicul.

<P>THIS degeneracy of manners among the clergy might, perhaps, have been tolerated with greater indulgence, if their exorbitant riches and power had not enab|led them at the &s;ame time, to oppre&s;s all other orders of men. It is the genius of &s;uper&s;tition, fond of whatever is pompous or grand, to &s;et no bounds to its liberality towards per&s;ons whom it e&s;teems &s;acred, and to think its expre&s;&s;ions of regard defective, unle&s;s it hath rai&s;ed them to the height of wealth and authority. Hence flowed the exten&s;ive revenues and juri&s;diction po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the church in every country of Europe, and which were become intolerable to the laity from who&s;e undi&s;|cerning bounty they were at fir&s;t derived.</P>
<P>THE burden, however, of eccle&s;ia&s;tical oppre&s;&s;ion had fallen with &s;uch peculiar weight on the Germans, as rendered them, though naturally exempt from levity, and tenacious of their ancient cu&s;toms, more inclinable than any people in Europe to li&s;ten to tho&s;e who call|ed on them to a&s;&s;ert their liberty. During the long conte&s;t between the Popes and Emperors concerning the right of inve&s;titure, and the wars which the&s;e occa&s;ioned mo&s;t of the con&s;iderable German eccle&s;ia&s;tics joined the pa|pal faction; and while engaged in rebellion again&s;t the head of the Empire, they &s;eized the Imperial revenues, and u&s;urped the Imperial juri&s;diction within their own dioce&s;es. Upon the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of tranquillity, they &s;till retained the&s;e u&s;urpations, as if by the length of an unju&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion they had acquired a legal right to them. The Emperors, too feeble to wre&s;t them out of their hands, were obliged to grant them fiefs of the&s;e va&s;t territories, and they enjoyed all the immunities and honours which belonged to feudal barons. By means of the&s;e, many bi&s;hops and abbots in Germany were

<P>THE un&s;ettled &s;tate of government in Germany, and the frequent wars to which that country was expo&s;ed, contributed in another manner towards aggrandizing Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tics. The only property during the&s;e times of anarchy which enjoyed &s;ecurity from the oppre&s;&s;ion of the great, or the ravages of war, was that which belong|ed to the church. This was owing, not only to the great reverence for the &s;acred character prevalent in tho&s;e ages, but to a &s;uper&s;titious dread of the &s;entence of excommunication, which the clergy were ready to denounce again&s;t all who invaded their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. Ma|ny ob&s;erving this, made a &s;urrender of their lands to the eccle&s;ia&s;tics, and con&s;enting to hold them in fee of the church, obtained as its va&s;&s;als a degree of &s;afety, which without this device they were unable to procure. By &s;uch an increa&s;e of the number of their va&s;&s;als, the pow|er of eccle&s;ia&s;tics received a real and permanent augmen|tation; and as lands, held in fee by the limited tenures common in tho&s;e ages, often returned to the per&s;ons on whom the fief depended, con&s;iderable additions were made in this way to the property of the clergy <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">F. Paul, Hi&s;t. of Eccle&s;. Benef. p. 66. Boulainvilliers, Etat de France, tom. i. 169. Lond. 1737.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE &s;olicitude of the clergy in providing for the &s;afe|ty of their own per&s;ons, was &s;till greater than that which they di&s;played in &s;ecuring their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and their efforts to attain it were &s;till more &s;ucce&s;sful. As they were con&s;ecrated to the prie&s;tly office with much out|ward &s;olemnity; were di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t of mankind by a peculiar dre&s;s and manner of life; and arrogated to their order many privileges which do not belong to other Chri&s;tians, they naturally became the objects of exce&s;&s;ive veneration. As a &s;uper&s;titious &s;pirit &s;pread, they were regarded as beings of a &s;uperior &s;pe|cies to the profane laity, whom it would be impious to try by the &s;ame laws, or to &s;ubject to the &s;ame puni&s;h|ments.

at fir&s;t to eccle&s;ia&s;tics, as a mark of re&s;pect, they &s;oon claimed as a point of right. This valuable immunity of the prie&s;thood is a&s;&s;erted, not only in the decrees of Popes and councils, but was confirmed in the mo&s;t am|ple form by many of the greate&s;t Emperors <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Golda&s;ti Con&s;titut.

But as the power of degradation was lodged in the &s;piritual courts, the difficulty and expence of obtaining &s;uch a &s;entence, too often &s;ecured offenders of ab&s;olute impunity.

<P>WHILE the clergy a&s;&s;erted de privileges of their own order with &s;uch zeal, they made continual encroach|ments upon tho&s;e of the laity. All cau&s;es relative to matrimony, to te&s;taments, to u&s;ury, to legitimacy of birth, as well as tho&s;e which concerned eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues, were thought to be &s;o connected with religion, that they could be tried only in the &s;piritual courts. Not &s;atisfied with this ample juri&s;diction, which extend|ed to one half of the &s;ubjects which give ri&s;e to litigation among men, the clergy, with wonderful indu&s;try, and by a thou&s;and inventions, endeavoured to draw all other cau&s;es into their own courts <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Giannon&egrave; Hi&s;t. of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aples, book xix. &sect; 3.</NOTE>; and as they had engro&s;|&s;ed the whole learning known in the dark ages, the &s;piritual judges were commonly &s;o far &s;uperior in know|ledge and abilities to tho&s;e employed in the &s;ecular courts, that the people at fir&s;t favoured any &s;tretch that was made to bring their affairs under the cognizance of a judicature, on the deci&s;ions of which they could rely

with &s;uperior confidence.

<P>THE penalty by which the &s;piritual courts enforced their &s;entences, added to them great weight and terror. The cen&s;ure of excommunication was in&s;tituted original|ly for pre&s;erving the purity of the church, that ob&s;tinate offenders, who&s;e impious tenets or profane lives were a reproach to chri&s;tianity, might be cut off from the &s;o|ciety of the faithful: This, eccle&s;ia&s;tics did not &s;cruple to convert into an engine for promoting their own power, and inflicted it on the mo&s;t frivolous occa&s;ions. Who|ever de&s;pi&s;ed any of their deci&s;ions, even concern|ing civil matters, immediately incurred this dreadful cen|&s;ure, which not only excluded them from all the pri|vileges of a Chri&s;tian, but deprived them of their rights as men and citizens<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Centum Gravam &sect; 34.</NOTE>; and the dread of this rendered even the mo&s;t fierce and turbulent &s;pirits ob&s;equious to the authority of the church.</P>
<P>NOR did the clergy neglect the proper methods of pre&s;erving the wealth and power which they had ac|quired with &s;uch indu&s;try and addre&s;s. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the church, being con&s;ecrated to God, were declared to be unalienable; &s;o that the funds of a &s;ociety which was daily gaining, and could never lo&s;e, grew to be im|men&s;e. In Germany, it was computed that the eccle&s;i|a&s;tics had got into their hands more than one half of the national property <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Centum Gravam. &sect; 28.</NOTE>. In other nations, the proportion varied; but the &s;hare belonging to the church was every where prodigious.

were plea&s;ed to grant any aid towards &s;upply|ing the public exigencies, this was con&s;idered as a free gift flowing from their own genero&s;ity, which the civil magi&s;trate had no title to demand, far le&s;s to exact. In con&s;equence of this &s;trange &s;oleci&s;m in government, the laity in Germany had the mortification to find them|&s;elves loaded with exce&s;&s;ive impo&s;itions, becau&s;e tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t property were freed from any obligation to &s;upport, or to defend the &s;tate.</P>
<P>GRIEVOUS, however, as the exorbitant wealth and numerous privileges of the clerical order were to the other members of the Germanick body, they would have reckoned it &s;ome mitigation of the evil, if the&s;e had been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed only by eccle&s;ia&s;tics re&s;iding among them&s;elves, who would have been le&s;s apt to make an improper u&s;e of their riches, or to exerci&s;e their rights with unbecoming rigour. But the bi&s;hops of Rome having early put in a claim, the bolde&s;t that ever human ambition &s;ugge&s;ted, of being &s;upreme and in|fallible heads of the Chri&s;tian church; they by their profound policy and unwearied per&s;everance, by their addre&s;s in availing them&s;elves of every circum&s;tance, which occurred, by taking advantage of the &s;uper&s;ti|tion of &s;ome Princes, of the nece&s;&s;ities of others, and of the credulity of the people, at length e&s;tabli&s;hed their preten&s;ions in oppo&s;ition both to the intere&s;t and com|mon &s;en&s;e of mankind. Germany was the country which the&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;overeigns governed with mo&s;t ab&s;olute authority. They excommunicated and depo&s;ed &s;ome of its mo&s;t illu&s;trious Emperors, and excited their &s;ubjects, their mini&s;ters, and even their children to take arms again&s;t them. Amid&s;t the&s;e conte&s;ts, the Popes continually extended their own immunities, and &s;poiled the &s;ecular Princes of their mo&s;t valuable prero|gatives, and the German church felt all the rigour of that oppre&s;&s;ion which flows from &s;ubjection to foreign dominion, and foreign exactions.</P>
<P>THE right of conferring benefices, which the Popes u&s;urped during that period of confu&s;ion, was an acqui|&s;ition of great importance, and exalted the eccle&s;ia&s;tical power upon the ruins of the temporal. The Emperors and other princes of Germany had long been in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion

of this right, and it &s;erved to increa&s;e both their authority and their revenue. But by wre&s;ting it out of their hands, the Popes were enabled to fill the Empire with their own creatures; they accu&s;tomed a great bo|dy of every prince's &s;ujects to depend not upon him but upon the Roman &s;ee; they be&s;towed the riche&s;t bene|fices in every country upon &s;trangers, and drained their wealth to &s;upply the luxury of a foreign court.

<P>BUT the court of Rome ea&s;ily found expedients for eluding an agreement which put &s;uch re&s;traints on its power. The practice of re&s;erving certain benefices in every country to the Pope's immediate nomination, which had been long known, and often complained of, was extended far beyond its ancient bounds. All the benefices po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Cardinals, or any of the numerous officers in the Roman court; tho&s;e held by per&s;ons who happened to die at Rome, or within forty miles of that city, on their journey to or from it; tho&s;e which became vacant by tran&s;lation, with many others, were included in that number; and Julius II. and Leo &s;tretching the matter to the utmo&s;t, often collated to benefices where the right of re&s;ervation had not been declared, on pre|tence of having mentally re&s;erved this privilege to them|&s;elves. The right of re&s;ervation, however, even with this exten&s;ion, had certain limits, as it could be exerci&s;ed only where the benefice was actually vacant; and there|fore, in order to render the exertion of papal power un|bounded, <HI>expectative graces,</HI> or mandates nominating a per&s;on to &s;ucceed to a benefice upon the fir&s;t vacancy that &s;hould happen, were brought into u&s;e.

the court of Rome, from which it received the&s;e rever|&s;ionary grants; princes were defrauded, in a great de|gree, of their prerogatives, and the rights of lay-patrons were pre-occupied, and rendered almo&s;t entirely vain <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Centum Gravam. &sect; 31.

<P>THE manner in which the&s;e extraordinary powers were exerci&s;ed, rendered them &s;till more odious and in|tolerable.

<P>THE &s;ums, indeed, which the court of Rome drew by its &s;tated and legal impo&s;itions from all the countries that acknowledged its authority, were &s;o con&s;iderable, that it is not &s;trange that they murmured at the &s;malle&s;t addition made to them by unnece&s;&s;ary or illicit means. Every eccle&s;ia&s;tical per&s;on, upon his admi&s;&s;ion to his be|nefice, paid <HI>annats,</HI> or one year's rent of his living to the Pope, and as that tax was exacted with great rigour, its amount was prodigious. To this mu&s;t be added the frequent demands made by the Popes of free gifts from the clergy, together with the extraordinary levies of tenths upon eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices, on pretence of ex|peditions again&s;t the Turks, &s;eldom intended, or car|ried into execution; and from the whole, the va&s;t pro|portion of the revenues of the church which flowed con|tinually to Rome, may be e&s;timated.</P>

century. Nor has this &s;ketch been copied from the controver&s;ial writers of that age, who, in the heat of di&s;putation, may be &s;u&s;pected of having exaggerated the errors, or of having mi&s;repre&s;ented the conduct of that church which they laboured to overturn; it is formed upon more authentick evidence, upon the me|morials and remon&s;trances of the Imperial diets, cooly enumerating the grievances under which the Empire groaned, in order to obtain the redre&s;s of them. Di&s;&s;a|tisfaction mu&s;t have ari&s;en to a great height among the people, when the&s;e grave a&s;&s;emblies expre&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves with &s;uch acrimony; and if they demanded the abolition of the&s;e enormities with &s;o much vehemence, the people, we may be a&s;&s;ured, uttered their &s;entiments and de&s;ires in bolder and more virulent language.</P>
<P>TO men thus prepared for &s;haking off the yoke, Lu|ther addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with certainty of &s;ucce&s;s. As they had long felt its weight, and borne it with impa|tience, they li&s;tened with joy to the fir&s;t propo&s;al for pro|curing deliverance. Hence proceeded the fond and ea|ger reception that his doctrines met with, and the rapi|dity with which they &s;pread over all the provinces of Germany. Even the impetuo&s;ity and fiercene&s;s of Lu|ther's &s;pirit, his confidence in a&s;&s;erting his own opi|nions, and the arrogance and contempt wherewith he treated all who differed from him, which, in ages of greater moderation and refinement, have been reckoned defects in the character of that reformer, did not appear exce&s;&s;ive to his contemporaries, who&s;e minds were &s;trongly agitated by tho&s;e intere&s;ting controver&s;ies which he carried on, and who had them&s;elves endured the ri|gour of papal tyranny, and &s;een the curruptions in the church again&s;t which he exclaimed.</P>
<P>NOR were they greatly offended at that gro&s;s &s;curri|lity with which his polemical writings are filled, or at the low buffoonery he &s;ometimes introduces into his grav|e&s;t di&s;cour&s;es. No di&s;pute was managed in tho&s;e rude times without a large portion of the former, and the lat|ter was common, even on the mo&s;t &s;olemn occa&s;ions, and in treating the mo&s;t &s;acred &s;ubjects. So far were either of them from doing hurt to his cau&s;e, that invec|tive and ridicule had &s;ome effect, as well as more laud|able

arguments, in expo&s;ing the errors of popery, and in determining mankind to abandon them.</P>
<P>BESIDES all the&s;e cau&s;es of Luther's rapid progre&s;s, ari&s;ing from the nature of his enterpri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, and the junc|ture at which he undertook it, he reaped advantage from &s;ome foreign and adventitious circum&s;tances, the beneficial influence of which none of his forerunners in the &s;ame cour&s;e had enjoyed. Among the&s;e may be reckoned the invention of the art of printing, about half a century before his time. By this fortunate di&s;|covery, the facility of acquiring and of propagating knowledge, was wonderfully increa&s;ed, and Luther's books, which mu&s;t otherwi&s;e have made their way &s;low|ly, and with uncertainty into di&s;tant countries, &s;pread at once all over Europe. Nor were they read only by the rich and the learned, who alone had acce&s;s to books before that invention; they got into the hands of the people, who, upon this appeal to them as judges, ventured to examine and to reject many doctrines, which they had formerly been required to believe, without being taught to under&s;tand them.</P>
<P>THE revival of learning at the &s;ame period was a cir|cum&s;tance extremely friendly to the reformation. The &s;tudy of the ancient Greek and Roman authors, and the di&s;covery of that liberal and found knowledge which they contain, rouzed the human mind from the pro|found lethargy in which it had been &s;unk during &s;eve|ral centuries. Mankind &s;eem, at that period, to have recovered the powers of inquiring and of thinking, fa|culties of which they had long lo&s;t the u&s;e; and fond of the acqui&s;ition, they exerci&s;ed them with great boldne&s;s upon all &s;ubjects. They were not now afraid of enter|ing an uncommon path, or of embracing a new opi|nion. Novelty appeals, at this time, rather to have been a recommendation to a doctrine; and in&s;tead of being &s;tartled when the daring hand of Luther drew a&s;ide, or tore the veil which covered e&s;tabli&s;hed errors, the ge|nius of the age applauded and aided the attempt. Lu|ther, though a &s;tranger to elegance in ta&s;te or compo|&s;ition, zealou&s;ly promoted the cultivation of ancient li|terature; and &s;en&s;ible or its being nece&s;&s;ary in &s;tudying the &s;criptures, he him&s;elf had acquired con&s;iderable
<PB N="71" REF="011837_0479_0F9D87D3753A28E0">
knowledge both in the Hebrew and Greek tongues. Melancthon, and &s;ome other of his di&s;ciples, were emi|nent proficients in the polite arts; and as the &s;ame bar|barous monks who oppo&s;ed the introduction of learning into Germany, &s;et them&s;elves with equal fiercene&s;s a|gain&s;t Luther's opinions, and declared the good recep|tion of the one to be the effect of the progre&s;s which the other had made, the cau&s;e of learning and of the refor|mation came to be con&s;idered as clo&s;ely connected, and, in every country, had the &s;ame friends, and the &s;ame enemies. This enabled the reformers to carry on the conte&s;t at fir&s;t with great &s;uperiority. Erudition, indu&s;|try, accuracy of &s;entiment, purity of compo&s;ition, and even wit and raillery, were wholly on their &s;ide, and triumphed with ea&s;e over illiterate monks, who&s;e rude arguments, expre&s;&s;ed in a perplexed and barbarous &s;tile, were found in&s;ufficient for the defence of a &s;y&s;tem, the errors of which, all the art and ingenuity of its lat|er and more learned advocates have not been able to palliate.</P>
<P>THAT bold &s;pirit of inquiry, which the revival of learning excited in Europe, was &s;o favourable to the Reformation, that Luther was aided in his progre&s;s, and mankind were prepared to embrace his doctrines, by per&s;ons who did not wi&s;h &s;ucce&s;s to his undertaking. The greater part of the ingenious men who applied to the &s;tudy of ancient literature, towards the clo&s;e of the fifteenth century, and the beginning of the &s;ixteenth, though they had no intention, and perhaps no wi&s;h to overturn the e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;y&s;tem of religion, had di&s;|covered the ab&s;urdity of many tenets and practices au|thorized by the church, and perceived the futility of tho&s;e arguments, by which illiterate monks endeavoured to defend them. Their contempt of the&s;e advocates for the received errors, led them frequently to expo&s;e the ignorance which they &s;upported, and to ridicule their opinions with the utmo&s;t freedom and &s;everity. By this men were prepared for the more &s;erious attacks made upon them by Luther, and their reverence both for the doctrines and per&s;ons again&s;t whom he inveigh|ed, was con&s;iderably abated. This was particularly the ca&s;e in Germany. When the fir&s;t attempts were made
<PB N="72" REF="011837_0480_0F9D87D435053248">
to revive a ta&s;te for ancient learning in that country, the Eccle&s;ia&s;tics there, who were &s;till more ignorant than their brethren on the other &s;ide of the Alps, &s;et them&s;elves to oppo&s;e its progre&s;s with more active zeal; and the patrons of the new &s;tudies, in return, attacked them with great violence. In the writings of Reuchlin, Hutten, and the other revivers of learning in Germany, the corruptions of the church of Rome are cen&s;ured with an acrimony of &s;tile, litle inferior to that of Luther him&s;elf <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Gerde&s;ius Hi&s;t.

<P>FROM the &s;ame cau&s;e proceeded the frequent &s;tric|tures of Era&s;mus upon the errors of the church, as well as upon the ignorance and vices of the clergy. His reputation and authority were &s;o high in Europe at the beginning of the &s;ixteenth century, and his works were read with &s;uch univer&s;al admiration, that the effect of the&s;e de&s;erves to be mentioned as one of the circum|&s;tances, which contributed towards Luther's &s;ucce&s;s. Era&s;mus having been de&s;tined for the church, and train|ed up in the knowledge of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical literature, ap|plied him&s;elf more to theological inquiries than any of the revivers of learning in that age. His acute judg|ment and va&s;t erudition, enabled him to di&s;cover many errors, both in the doctrine and wor&s;hip of the Romi&s;h church. Some of the&s;e he confuted with great &s;olidity of rea&s;oning, and force of eloquence. Others he treat|ed as objects of ridicule, and turned again&s;t them that irre&s;i&s;tible torrent of popular and &s;atirical wit, of which he had the command. There was &s;carce any opinion or practice of the Romi&s;h church which Luther endea|voured to reform, but what had been previou&s;ly ani|madverted upon by Era&s;mus, and had afforded him &s;ubject either of cen&s;ure or of raillery. When Luther fir&s;t began his attack upon the church, Era&s;mus &s;eemed to applaud his conduct; he courted the friend&s;hip of &s;e|veral of his di&s;ciples and patrons; and condemned the behaviour and &s;pirit of his adver&s;aries <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Seckend. lib. i. p. 40, 96.</NOTE>. He concurred openly with him in inveighing again&s;t the &s;chool di|vines,

as the teachers of a &s;y&s;tem equally unedifying and ob&s;cure. He joined him in endeavouring to turn the attention of men to the &s;tudy of the holy &s;criptures, as the only &s;tandard of religious truth <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Vonder Hardt. Hi&s;tor. Literar.

<P>VARIOUS circum&s;tances, however, prevented Era&s;|mus from holding the &s;ame cour&s;e with Luther. The natural timidity of his temper; his want of that force of mind which alone can prompt a man to a&s;&s;ume the cha|racter of a reformer <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Era&s;mus him&s;elf is candid enough to acknowledge this: "Luther, &s;ays he, has given us many a whole&s;ome doctrine, and many a good coun&s;el. I wi&s;h he had not defeated the effect of them by intolerable faults. But if he had written every thing in the mo&s;t unexceptionable manner, I had no inclination to die for the &s;ake of truth. Every man hath not the courage requi&s;ite to make a martyr; and I am afraid, that if I were put to the trial, I &s;hould imitate St. Peter." Epi&s;t. Era&s;mi in Jortin's Life of Era&s;m. vol i. p. 273.</NOTE>; his exce&s;&s;ive deference for per|&s;ons in high &s;tation; his dread of loo&s;ing the pen&s;ions and other emoluments which their liberality had confer|red upon him; his extreme love of peace, and hopes of reforming abu&s;es gradually, and by gentle methods; all concurred in determining him to repre&s;s and to mo|derate the zeal, with which he had once been animated again&s;t the errors of the church <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Jortin's Life of Era&s;mus, vol. i. p. 2 8.</NOTE>; and to a&s;&s;ume the character of a mediator between Luther and his oppon|ents. But though Era&s;mus &s;oon began to cen&s;ure Lu|ther as too daring and impetuous, and was at la&s;t pre|vailed upon to write again&s;t him, he mu&s;t, neverthe|le&s;s, be con&s;idered as his forerunner and auxiliary in this war upon the church. He fir&s;t &s;cattered the &s;eeds, which Luther cheri&s;hed and brought to maturity. His raillery and oblique cen&s;ures, prepared the way for Lu|ther's invectives and more direct attacks. In this light Era&s;mus appeared to the zealous defenders of the Rom|i&s;h church in his own times <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Vonder Hardt. Hi&s;t. Literar. Reform. pars i. p. 2.</NOTE>. In this light he mu&s;t be con&s;idered by every per&s;on conver&s;ant in the hi&s;tory of that period.</P>
<P>IN this long enumeration of the circum&s;tances which combined in favouring the progre&s;s of Luther's opinions,
<PB N="74" REF="011837_0482_0F9D87D5B10C0F90">
or in weakening the re&s;i&s;tance of his adver&s;aries, I have avoided entering into any di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the theological doctrines of popery, and have not attempted to &s;hew how repugnant they are to the &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity, and how de&s;ti&s;tute of any foundation in rea&s;on, in the word of God, or in the practice of the primitive church, leav|ing the&s;e topics entirely to eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;torians, to who&s;e province they peculiarly belong. But when we add the effect of the&s;e religious con&s;iderations to the in|fluence of political cau&s;es, it is obvious that the united operation of both on the human mind, mu&s;t have been &s;udden and irre&s;i&s;tible. And though, to Luther's con|temporaries, who were too near perhaps to the &s;cene, or too deeply intere&s;ted in it, to trace cau&s;es with accu|racy, or to examine them with coolne&s;s, the rapidity with which his opinions &s;pread appeared to be &s;o unac|countable, that &s;ome of them imputed it to a certain uncommon and malignant po&s;ition of the &s;tars, which &s;cattered the &s;pirit of giddine&s;s and innovation over the world <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Jovii Hi&s;toria, Lut. 1553. fol. p. 134.</NOTE>, it is evident, that their &s;ucce&s;s was the natural effect of many powerful cau&s;es prepared by peculiar pro|vidence, and happily con&s;piring to that end. This at|tempt to inve&s;tigate the cau&s;es, and to throw light on an event &s;o &s;ingular and important, will not, perhaps, be deemed an unnece&s;&s;ary digre&s;&s;ion.&mdash;I return from it to the cour&s;e of the hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>THE Diet at Worms conducted its deliberations with that &s;low formality peculiar to &s;uch a&s;&s;emblies. Much time was &s;pent in e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;ome regulations with re|gard to the internal police of the Empire. The juri&s;dic|tion of the Imperial chamber was confirmed, and the forms of its proceeding rendered more fixed and regu|lar. A council of regency was appointed to a&s;&s;i&s;t Fer|dinand in the government of the Empire during his bro|ther's ab&s;ence; which, from the extent of the Empe|ror's dominions, and the multiplicity of his affairs, was an event that might be frequently expected <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Pont. Heuter. Rer. Au&s;tr. Lib. viii. c. 11. p. 195. P&s;e&s;&s;el Abreg&eacute; Chronol. p. 598.</NOTE>. The &s;tate of religion was then taken into con&s;ideration. There were not wanting &s;ome plau&s;ible rea&s;ons which might

have induced Charles to have declared him&s;elf the pro|tector of Luther's cau&s;e, or at lea&s;t to have connived at its progre&s;s. If he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no other dominions but tho&s;e which belonged to him in Germany, and no other crown be&s;ide the Imperial, he might have been di&s;po&s;ed perhaps to favour a man, who a&s;&s;erted &s;o bold|ly the privileges and immunities for which the Empire had &s;truggled &s;o long with the Popes. But the va&s;t and dangerous &s;chemes which Francis I. was forming again&s;t him, made it nece&s;&s;ary for him to regulate his conduct by views more exten&s;ive than tho&s;e which would have &s;uited a German prince; and it being of the utmo&s;t im|portance to &s;ecure the Pope's friend&s;hip, this determined him to treat Luther with great &s;everity, as the mo&s;t ef|fectual method of &s;oothing Leo into a concurrence with his mea&s;ures. His eagerne&s;s to accompli&s;h this, render|ed him not unwilling to gratify the papal legates in Ger|many, who in&s;i&s;ted that, without any delay or formal deliberation, the diet ought to condemn a man whom the Pope had already excommunicated as an incorrig|ible heretick. Such an abrupt manner of proceeding, however, being deemed unprecedented and unju&s;t by by the members of the diet, they made a point of Lu|ther's appearing in per&s;on, and declaring whether he ad|hered or not to tho&s;e opinions, which had drawn upon him the cen&s;ures of the church <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">P. Mart. Bp. 722.</NOTE>. Not only the Empe|ror, but all the Princes through who&s;e territories he had to pa&s;s, granted him a &s;afe-conduct; and Charles wrote to him at the &s;ame time, requiring his immediate atten|dance on the diet, and renewing his promi&s;es of pro|tection from any injury or violence <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Luth.

But Luther, &s;uperior to &s;uch terrors, &s;ilenced them with this reply, "I am lawfully

<P>THE reception he met with at Worms, was &s;uch as he might have reckoned a full reward of all his labours, if vanity and the love of applau&s;e had been the princi|ples by which he was influenced. Greater crowds a&s;|&s;embled to behold him, than had appeared at the Em|peror's publick entry; his apartments were daily filled with princes and per&s;onages of the highe&s;t rank <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Seckend. 156. Luth. Oper. ii. 414.</NOTE>, and he was treated with all the re&s;pect paid to tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s the power of directing the under&s;tanding and &s;entiments of other men; an homage, more &s;incere, as well as more flattering, than any which pre-eminence in birth or condition can command. At his appearance before the diet, he behaved with great decency, and with equal firmne&s;s. He readily acknowledged an ex|ce&s;s of vehemence and acrimony in his controver&s;ial writings, but refu&s;ed to retract his opinions unle&s;s he were convinced of their fal&s;hood; or to con&s;ent to their being tried by any other rule than the word of God. When neither threats nor entreaties could prevail on him to depart from this re&s;olution, &s;ome of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics propo&s;ed to imitate the example of the council of Con|&s;tance, and by puni&s;hing the author of this pe&s;tilent he|re&s;y, who was now in their power, to deliver the church at once from &s;uch an evil. But the members of the di|et refu&s;ing to expo&s;e the German integrity to fre&s;h re|proach by a &s;econd violation of publick faith; and Charles being no le&s;s unwilling to bring a &s;tain upon the beginning of his admini&s;tration by &s;uch an ignominious action, Luther was permitted to depart in &s;afety <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">F.

<P>BUT this rigorous decree had no con&s;iderable effect, the execution of it being prevented partly by the mul|tiplicity of occupations which the commotions in Spain, and the wars in Italy and the Low Countries, created to the Emperor; and partly by a prudent precaution em|ployed by the elector of Saxony, Luther's faithful pa|tron. As Luther, on his return from Worms, was pa&s;|&s;ing near Alten&s;tein in Thuringia, a number of hor&s;emen in ma&s;ks ru&s;hed &s;uddenly out of a wood, where the Elec|tor had appointed them to lie in wait for him, and &s;ur|rounding his company, carried him, after di&s;mi&s;&s;ing all his attendants, to Wartburg, a &s;trong ca&s;tle not far di&s;|tant. There the Elector ordered him to be &s;upplied with every thing nece&s;&s;ary or agreeable, but the place of his retreat was carefully concealed, until upon a change in the political &s;ituation of Europe, the fury of the pre|&s;ent &s;torm again&s;t him began to abate. In this &s;olitude, where he remained nine months, and which he fre|quently called his Patmos, after the name of that i&s;land to which the apo&s;tle John was bani&s;hed, he exerted his u&s;ual vigour and indu&s;try in defence of his doctrines, or in confutation of his adver&s;aries, publi&s;hing &s;everal trea|ti&s;es, which revived the &s;pirit of his followers, a&s;toni&s;hed to a great degree, and di&s;heartened at the &s;udden di&s;|appearance of their leader.</P>
<P>DURING his confinement, his opinions continued to gain ground, acquiring the a&s;cendant in almo&s;t every city of Saxony. At this time, the Augu&s;tinians of Wit|temberg, with the approbation of the univer&s;ity, and the connivance of the Elector, ventured upon the fir&s;t &s;tep towards an alteration in the e&s;tabli&s;hed forms of publick wor&s;hip, by aboli&s;hing the celebration of pri|vate ma&s;&s;es, and by giving the cup as well as the bread to the laity in admini&s;tering the &s;acrament of the Lord's &s;upper.</P>
<P>WHATEVER con&s;olation the courage and &s;ucce&s;s of his di&s;ciples, or the progre&s;s of his doctrines in his own country afforded Luther in his retreat, he there received

information of two events which con&s;iderably damped his joy, as they &s;eemed to lay in&s;uperable ob&s;tacles in the way of propagating his principles in the two mo&s;t powerful kingdoms of Europe. One was, a &s;olemn decree, condemning his opinions, publi&s;hed by the uni|ver&s;ity of Paris, the mo&s;t ancient, and at that time the mo&s;t re&s;pectable of the learned &s;ocieties in Europe. The other was, the an&s;wer written to his book concern|ing the Babyloni&s;h captivity by Henry VIII. of England. That young monarch, having been educated under the eye of a &s;u&s;picious father, who, in order to prevent his attending to bu&s;ine&s;s, kept him occupied in the &s;tudy of literature, &s;till retained a greater love of learning, and &s;tronger habits of application to it, than are common among Princes of &s;o active a di&s;po&s;ition, and &s;uch vio|lent pa&s;&s;ions; and being ambitious of acquiring glory of every kind, as well as zealou&s;ly attached to the Ro|mi&s;h church, and highly exa&s;perated again&s;t Luther, who had treated Thomas Aquinas, his favourite author, with great contempt, he did not think it enough to exert his royal authority in oppo&s;ing the opinions of the reformer, but re&s;olved likewi&s;e to combat them with &s;chola&s;tic weapons. With this view he publi&s;hed his treati&s;e on the Seven Sacraments, which, though for|gotten at pre&s;ent, as books of controver&s;y always are, when the occa&s;ion that produced them is pa&s;t, is not de&s;titute of polemical ingenuity and acutene&s;s, and was repre&s;ented by the flattery of his courtiers to be a work of &s;uch wonderful &s;cience and learning, as exalted him no le&s;s above other authors in merit, than he was di&s;tingui&s;h|ed among them by his rank. The Pope, to whom it was pre&s;ented with the greate&s;t formality in full con&s;i&s;to|ry, &s;poke of it in &s;uch terms, as if it had been dictated by immediate in&s;piration; and as a te&s;timony of the gratitude of the church for his extraordinary zeal, con|ferred on him the title of <HI>Defender of the Faith,</HI> an ap|pellation which Henry &s;oon forfeited in the opinion of tho&s;e from whom he derived it, and which is &s;till the title of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, though the avowed enemies of tho&s;e opinions, by contending for which he merited that honourable di&s;tinction.

of the monarch, &s;oon publi&s;hed his animadver&s;ions on both, in a &s;tile no le&s;s vehement and &s;evere than he would have u&s;ed in confuting his meane&s;t antagoni&s;t. This indecent boldne&s;s, in&s;tead of &s;hocking his contem|poraries, was con&s;idered by them as a new proof of his undaunted &s;pirit; a controver&s;y managed by di&s;putants &s;o illu&s;trious, drew more general attention; and &s;uch was the contagion of the &s;pirit of innovation diffu&s;ed through Europe in that age, and &s;o powerful the evi|dence which accompanied the doctrines of the reformers on their fir&s;t publication, that, in &s;pite both of the civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical powers combined again&s;t them, they daily gained converts both in France and in England.</P>
<P>HOWEVER de&s;irous the Emperor might be to put a &s;top to Luther's progre&s;s, he was often obliged, during the diet at Worms, to turn his thoughts to matters &s;till more intere&s;ting, and which demanded more immediate attention. A war was ready to break out between him and Francis in Navarre, in the Low-Countries, and in Italy; and it required either great addre&s;s to avert the danger or timely and wi&s;e precautions to re&s;i&s;t it. Eve|ry circum&s;tance, at that juncture, inclined Charles to prefer the former mea&s;ure. Spain was torn with inte&s;|tine commotions. In Italy, he had not hitherto &s;ecured the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any one ally. In the Low-Countries, his &s;ubjects trembled at the thoughts of a rupture with France, the fatal effects of which on their commerce they had often experienced. From the&s;e con&s;iderations, as well as from the &s;olicitude of Chievres during his whole admini&s;tration to maintain peace between the two monarchs, proceeded the Emperor's backwardne&s;s to commence ho&s;tilities. But Francis and his mini&s;ters did not breathe the &s;ame pracific &s;pirit. He ea&s;ily fore|&s;aw that concord could not long &s;ub&s;i&s;t, where intere&s;t, emulation, and ambition con&s;pired to di&s;&s;olve it; and he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;everal advantages which flattered him with the hopes of &s;urpri&s;ing his rival, and of overpowering him before he could put him&s;elf in a po&s;ture of defence. The French King's dominions, from their compact &s;ituation, from their &s;ubjection to the royal authority, from the genius of the people, fond of war, and attach|ed to their &s;overeign by every tie of duty and affection,
<PB N="80" REF="011837_0488_0F9D87DAF1957F28">
were more capable of a great or &s;udden effort, than the larger but di&s;united territories of the Emperor, in one part of which the people were in arms again&s;t his mini&s;|ters, and in all his prerogative was more limited than that of his rival.</P>
<P>THE only princes, in who&s;e power it was to have kept down, or to have extingui&s;hed this flame on its fir&s;t aapearance, either neglected to exert them&s;elves, or were active in kindling and &s;preading it. Henry VIII. though he affected to a&s;&s;ume the name of mediator, and both parties made frequent appeals to him, had laid a&s;ide the impartiality which &s;uited that character. Wol|&s;ey, by his artifices, had e&s;tranged him &s;o entirely from the French King, that he &s;ecretly fomented the di&s;cord which he ought to have compo&s;ed, and waited only for &s;ome decent pretext to join his arms to the Emperor's <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Herbert. Fiddes's Life of Wol&s;ey, 258.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>LEO'S endeavours to excite di&s;cord between the Em|peror and Francis were more avowed, and had greater influence. Not only his duty, as the common father of Chri&s;tendom, but his intere&s;t as an Italian potentate, called upon the Pope to act as the guardian of the pub|lic tranquillity, and to avoid any mea&s;ure that might overturn the &s;y&s;tem, which after much blood&s;hed, and many negociations, was now e&s;tabli&s;hed in Italy. Ac|cordingly Leo, who in&s;tantly di&s;cerned the propriety of this conduct, had formed a &s;cheme upon Charles's pro|motion to the Imperial dignity, of rendering him&s;elf the umpire between the rivals, by &s;oothing them alternately, while he entered into no clo&s;e confederacy with either; and a Pontiff le&s;s ambitious and enterpri&s;izing, might have &s;aved Europe from many calamities by adhering to this plan. But this high &s;pirited prelate, who was &s;till in the prime of life, longed pa&s;&s;ionately to di&s;tingui&s;h his pontificate by &s;ome &s;plendid action. He was impa|tient to wa&s;h away the infamy of having lo&s;t Parma and Placentia, the acqui&s;ition of which reflected &s;o much lu&s;tre on the admini&s;tration of his predece&s;&s;or Julius. He beheld, with the indignation natural to Italians in that age, the dominion which the Tran&s;alpine, or as they in imitation of the Roman arrogance denominated them,
<PB N="81" REF="011837_0489_0F9D87DBB0647938">
the barbarous nations, had attained in Italy. He flat|tered him&s;elf, that after a&s;&s;i&s;ting the one monarch to &s;trip the other of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in that country, he might find means of driving out the victor in his turn, and acquire the glory of re&s;toring Italy to the liberty and happine&s;s it enjoyed before the inva&s;ion of Charles VIII. when every &s;tate was governed by its native princes, or its own laws, and unacquainted with a foreign yoke. Extravagant and chimerical as this project may &s;eem, it was the favourite object of almo&s;t every Italian eminent for genius or enterprize during great part of the &s;ix|teenth century; they vainly hoped, that by &s;uperior &s;kill in the artifices and refinements of negociation, they would be able to baffle the efforts of nations, ruder in|deed than them&s;elves, but much more powerful and warlike. So alluring was the pro&s;pect of this to Leo, that notwith&s;tanding the gentlene&s;s of his di&s;po&s;ition, and his fondne&s;s for the plea&s;ures of a refined and luxu|rious ea&s;e, he ha&s;tened to di&s;turb the peace of Europe, and to plunge him&s;elf in a dangerous war, with an im|petuo&s;ity &s;carce inferior to that of the turbulent and martial Julius <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Guic. l. 14. p. 173.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT was in Leo's power, however, to choo&s;e which of the monarchs he would take for his confederate again&s;t the other. Both of them courted his friend&s;hip; he wavered for &s;ome time between them, and at fir&s;t concluded an alliance with Francis. The object of this treaty was the conque&s;t of Naples, which the confe|derates agreed to divide between them. The Pope, it is probable, flattered him&s;elf that the bri&s;k and active &s;pirit of Francis, &s;econded by the &s;ame qualities in his &s;ubjects, would get the &s;tart of the &s;low and wary coun|cils of the Emperor, and that they might over-run with ea&s;e this detached portion of his dominions, ill provided for defence, and always the prey of every invader. But whether the French King, by di&s;covering too openly his &s;u&s;picions of Leo's &s;incerity, di&s;appointed the&s;e hopes; whether the treaty was only an artifice of the Pope's, to cover the more &s;erious negociations he was carrying on with Charles; whether he was enticed by the pro&s;pect of reaping greater advantages

from an union with that prince; or whether he was &s;oothed by the zeal which Charles had manife&s;ted for the honour of the church in condemning Luther; cer|tain it is, that he &s;oon de&s;erted his new ally, and made overtures of friend&s;hip, though with great &s;ecrecy, to the Emperor <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Guic. lib. 14. p. 175.

<P>WHILE the Pope and Emperor were preparing, in con&s;equence of their &s;ecret alliance, to attack Milan, ho&s;tilities commenced in another quarter. The children of John d'Albret King of Navarre having often de|manded the re&s;titution of their hereditary dominions, in terms of the treaty of Noyon, and Charles having as often eluded their reque&s;t upon very frivolous pretexts, Francis thought him&s;elf authorized by that treaty to a&s;&s;i&s;t the exiled family. The juncture appeared ex|tremely favourable for &s;uch an enterprize. Charles was at a di&s;tance from that part of his dominions; the troops u&s;ually &s;tationed there had been called away to quell the commotions in Spain; the Spani&s;h malecontents warmly &s;olicited him to invade Navarre <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">P.

their ancient monarchs. But in order to avoid, as much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> po&s;&s;ible, giving offence to the Emperor, or King of England, Francis directed forces to be levied, and the war to be carried on, not in his own name, but in that of Henry d'Albret. The conduct of the&s;e troops was committed to Andrew de Foix, de l'E&s;parre, a young nobleman, whom his nea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> alliance to the unfortunate king, who&s;e battles he was to fight, and what was &s;till more powerful, the intere&s;t of his &s;i&s;ter, Madame de Chateaubriand, Francis's favourite mi&s;tre&s;s, recom|mended to that important tru&s;t, for which he had nei|ther talents nor experience. But as there was no army in the field to oppo&s;e him, he became ma&s;ter, in a few days, of the whole kingdom of Navarre, without meet|ing with any ob&s;truction but from the citadel of Pam|peluna. The additional works to this fortre&s;s begun by Ximenes, were &s;till unfini&s;hed; nor would its &s;light re|&s;i&s;tance have de&s;erved notice, if Ignatio Loyola, a Bi&s;|cayan gentleman, had not been dangerou&s;ly wounded in its defence. During the progre&s;s of a lingering cure, Loyola happened to have no other amu&s;ement than what he found in reading the lives of the &s;aints: The effect of this on his mind, naturally enthu&s;ia&s;tic, but ambi|tious and daring, was to in&s;pire him with &s;uch a de&s;ire of emulating the glory of the&s;e fabulous worthies of the Romi&s;h church, as led him into the wilde&s;t and mo&s;t ex|travagant adventures; which terminated at la&s;t in in&s;ti|tuting the &s;ociety of Je&s;uits, the mo&s;t political and be&s;t regulated of all the mona&s;tic orders, and from which mankind have derived more advantages, and received greater hurt, than from any other of the&s;e religious fra|ternities.</P>
<P>IF, upon the reduction of Pampeluna, L'E&s;parre had been &s;atisfied with taking proper precautions for &s;e|curing his conque&s;t, the kingdom of Navarre might &s;till have remained annexed to the crown of France, in reality as well as in title. But, pu&s;hed on by youthful ardour, and encouraged by Francis, who was too apt to be dazzled with &s;ucce&s;s, he ventured to pa&s;s the con|fines of Navarre, and to lay &s;iege to Logrogno, a &s;mall city in Ca&s;tile. This rouzed the Ca&s;tilians, who had hi|therto beheld the rapid progre&s;s of his arms with great

unconcern; and the di&s;&s;en&s;ions in that kingdom being almo&s;t compo&s;ed, both parties exerted them&s;elves with emulation in defence of their country; the one that it might efface the memory of pa&s;t mi&s;conduct by their pre&s;ent zeal; the other that it might add to the merit of having &s;ubdued the Emperor's rebellious &s;ubjects, that of repul&s;ing his foreign enemies. The &s;udden advance of their troops, together with the gallant defence made by the inhabitants of Logrogno, obliged the French ge|neral to abandon his ra&s;h enterprize. The Spani&s;h ar|my, which increa&s;ed every day, hara&s;&s;ing him during his retreat, he, in&s;tead of taking &s;helter under the can|non of Pampeluna, or waiting the arrival of &s;ome troops who were marching to join him, attacked the Spaniards, though far &s;uperior to him in number, with great im|petuo&s;ity, but with &s;o little conduct, that his forces were totally routed, he him&s;elf, together with his prin|cipal officers, were taken pri&s;oners, and Spain recovered po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Navarre in &s;till &s;horter time than the French had &s;pent in the conque&s;t of it <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Bellay, p. 21. P. Mart. Ep. 726.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHILE Francis endeavoured to ju&s;tify his inva&s;ion of Navarre, by carrying it on in the name of Henry D'Albret, he had recour&s;e to an artifice much of the &s;ame kind, in attacking another part of the Emperor's territories. Robert de la Marck, lord of the &s;mall but independent territory of Bouillon, &s;ituated on the fron|tiers of Luxemburg and Champagne, having abandoned Charles's &s;ervice on account of an encroachment which the Aulic council made on his juri&s;diction, and having thrown him&s;elf upon France for protection, was ea&s;ily per&s;uaded, in the heat of his re&s;entment, to &s;end a he|rald to Worms, and to declare war in form again&s;t the Emperor. Such extravagant in&s;olence in a petty prince &s;urprized Charles, and appeared to him a certain proof of his having received promi&s;es of powerful &s;upport from the French King. The ju&s;tne&s;s of this conclu&s;ion &s;oon became evident. Robert with troops levied in France, by the King's connivance, though &s;emingly in contradiction to his orders, entered Luxemburg, and after ravaging the open country, laid &s;iege to Vireton.
<PB N="86" REF="011837_0494_0F9D882C55BC0E70">
Of this Charles complained loudly, as a direct violation of the peace &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the two crowns, and &s;ummoned Henry VIII. in terms of the treaty concluded at London in the year one thou&s;and five hundred and eighteen, to turn his arms again&s;t France as the fir&s;t ag|gre&s;&s;or; and though Francis pretended that he was not an&s;werable for Robert's conduct, who&s;e army fought under his own &s;tandards, and in his own quarrel, and who, contrary to an expre&s;s prohibition, had &s;educed &s;ome &s;ubjects of France into his &s;ervice; Henry paid &s;o little regard to this eva&s;ion, that the French King, ra|ther than irritate a prince whom he &s;till hoped to gain, commanded de la Marck to di&s;band his troops <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Bellay, p. 22. &amp;c. Mem. de Fleuranges, p. 335, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Emperor, meanwhile, was a&s;&s;embling an army to cha&s;ti&s;e Robert's in&s;olence. Twenty thou&s;and men under the Count of Na&s;&s;au invaded his little territories, and in a few days became ma&s;ters of every place in them but Sedan. After making him feel &s;o &s;en&s;ibly the weight of his ma&s;ter's indignation. Na&s;&s;au advanced towards the frontiers of France; and Charles know|ing that he might pre&s;ume &s;o far on Henry's par|tiality in his favour, as not to be over-awed by the &s;ame fears which had re&s;trained Francis, ordered his general to be&s;iege Mou&s;on. The cowardice of the garri&s;on hav|ing obliged the governor to &s;urrender almo&s;t without re|&s;i&s;tance. Na&s;&s;au inve&s;ted Mezieres, a place at that time of no con&s;iderable &s;trength, but &s;o advantageou&s;ly &s;itu|ated, that by getting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, the Imperial army might have penetrated into the heart of Champagne, in which there was &s;carce any other town capable of ob|&s;tructing its progre&s;s. Happily for France, its monarch, &s;en&s;ible of the importance of this fortre&s;s, and of the danger to which it was expo&s;ed, committed the defence of it to the Chevalier Bayard, di&s;tingui&s;hed among his contemporaries by the appellation of <HI>The Knight without fear, and without reproach</HI> <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Oeuvres de Brantome, tom. vi. 114.</NOTE>.

The&s;e he had many occa&s;ions of exerting in the defence of Mezieres; partly by his valour, partly by his conduct, he protracted the &s;iege to a great length, and in the end obliged the Imperiali&s;ts to rai&s;e it, with infamy and lo&s;s <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Bellay, p. 25, &amp;c.</NOTE>. Francis at the head of a numerous army &s;oon retook Mou&s;on, and entering the Low Countries, made &s;everal conque&s;ts of &s;mall importance.

<P>DURING the&s;e operations in the field, a congre&s;s was held at Calais under the mediation of Henry VIII. in order to bring all differences to an amicable i&s;&s;ue; and if the intentions of the mediator had corre&s;ponded in any degree to his profe&s;&s;ions, it could &s;carce have failed of producing &s;ome good effect. Henry committed the &s;ole management of the negociation, with unlimited powers, to Wol&s;ey; and this choice alone was &s;ufficient to have rendered it abortive. That prelate, bent on at|taining the papal crown, the great object of his ambi|tion, and ready to &s;acrifice every thing in order to gain the Emperor's intere&s;t, was &s;o little able to conceal his partiality, that if Francis had not been well acquainted with his haughty and vindictive temper, he would have declined his mediation. Much time was &s;pent in inquir|ing who had begun ho&s;tilities, which Wol&s;ey affected to repre&s;ent as the principal point; and by throwing the blame of that on Francis, he hoped to ju&s;tify by the treaty of London, any alliance into which his ma&s;ter &s;hould enter with Charles. The conditions on which ho&s;tilities might be terminated, came next to be con|&s;idered; but with regard to the&s;e, the Emperor's pro|po&s;als were &s;uch as di&s;covered either that he was utterly aver&s;e from peace, or that he knew Wol&s;ey would ap|prove

The&s;e terms, to which an high-&s;pirited prince would &s;carce have li&s;|tened, after the di&s;a&s;ters of the mo&s;t unfortunate war, Francis rejected with great di&s;dain; and Charles &s;hew|ing no inclination to comply with the more equal and moderate propo&s;itions of the French monarch, that he &s;hould re&s;tore Navarre to its lawful prince, and with|draw his troops from the &s;iege of Tournay, the congre&s;s broke up without any other effect, than that which at|tends un&s;ucce&s;sful negociations, the exa&s;perating of the parties, whom it was intended to reconcile <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">P.

<P>DURING the continuance of the congre&s;s, Wol&s;ey, on pretence that the Emperor him&s;elf would be more willing to make rea&s;onable conce&s;&s;ions than his mini&s;|ters, made an excur&s;ion to Bruges, to meet that mo|narch. He was received by Charles, who knew his vanity, with as much re&s;pect and magnificence as if he had been King of England. But in&s;tead of advancing the treaty of peace by this interview, Wol&s;ey, in his ma&s;ter's name, concluded a league with the Emperor again&s;t Francis; in which it was &s;tipulated, that Charles &s;hould invade France on the &s;ide of Spain, and Henry in Picardy, each with an army of forty thou&s;and men; and that, in order to &s;trengthen their union, Charles &s;hould e&s;pou&s;e the Prince&s;s Mary, Henry's only child, and the apparent heir of his dominions <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Rymer, Foeder. xiii.

The advantages which accrued to his &s;ub|jects from maintaining an exact neutrality, or the ho|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> re&s;ulted to him&s;elf from acting as the arbiter between contending princes, appeared to his youthful imagination &s;o incon&s;iderable, when compared with the glory which Charles and Francis reaped from leading ar|mies or conquering provinces, that he determined to remain no longer in a &s;tate of inactivity. Having once taken this re&s;olution, his inducements to prefer an al|liance with Charles were obvious. He had no claim upon any part of that Prince's dominions, mo&s;t of which were &s;o &s;ituated, that he could not attack them without great difficulty and di&s;advantage; whereas &s;e|veral maritime provinces of France had been long in the hands of the Engli&s;h monarchs, who&s;e preten&s;ions, even to the crown of that kingdom, were not altogether for|gotten; and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Calais not only gave him ea&s;y acce&s;s into &s;ome of the&s;e provinces, but afforded him, in ca&s;e of any di&s;a&s;ter, a &s;ecure retreat. While Charles attacked France upon one frontier, Henry flat|tered him&s;elf that he would find little re&s;i&s;tance on the other, and that the glory of re-annexing to the crown of England the ancient inheritance of its monarchs on the continent, was re&s;erved for his reign. Wol&s;ey art|fully encouraged the&s;e vain hopes, which led his ma&s;ter into &s;uch mea&s;ures as were mo&s;t &s;ub&s;ervient to his own &s;ecret &s;chemes; and the Engli&s;h, who&s;e hereditary ani|mo&s;ity again&s;t the French was apt to rekindle on every occa&s;ion, did not di&s;approve of the martial &s;pirit of their &s;overeign.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE the league between the Pope and the Emperor produced great effects in Italy, and rendered Lombardy the chief theatre of war. There was, at that time, &s;uch contrariety between the character of the French and Italians, that the latter &s;ubmitted to the go|vernment of the former with greater impatience, than they expre&s;&s;ed under the dominion of other foreigners. The phlegm of the Germans and gravity of the Spani|ards, &s;uited their jealous temper and ceremonious man|ners better than the French gaiety, too prone to gal|lantry, and too little attentive to decorum.

however, by the equity and gentlene&s;s of his admini|&s;tration, and by granting the Milane&s;e more exten&s;ive privileges than they had enjoyed under their native princes, had overcome, in a great mea&s;ure, their pre|judices, and reconciled them to the French government. Francis on recovering that dutchy, did not imitate the example of his predece&s;&s;or; and though too generous him&s;elf to oppre&s;s his people, his confidence in his fa|vourites, and his negligence in examining into the con|duct of tho&s;e whom he entru&s;ted with power, embolden|ed them to venture upon many acts of oppre&s;&s;ion. The government of Milan was committed by him to Odet de Foix, Marechal de Lautrec, another brother of Ma|dame de Chateaubriand, an officer of great experience and reputation, but haughty, imperious, rapacious and incapable either of li&s;tening to advice, or bearing con|tradiction. His in&s;olence and exactions totally alienated the affections of the Milane&s;e from France, drove many of the con&s;iderable citizens into bani&s;hment, and forced others to retire for their own &s;afety. Among the la&s;t was Jerome Meron&egrave;, vice-chancellor of Milan, a man who&s;e genius for intrigue and enterprize di&s;tingui&s;hed him in an age and country, where violent factions, as well as frequent revolutions, affording great &s;cope for &s;uch talents, produced or called them forth in great abundance. He repaired to Francis Sforza, who&s;e bro|ther Maximilian he had betrayed; and &s;u&s;pecting the Pope's intention of attacking the Milane&s;e, although his treaty with the Emperor was not yet made publick, propo&s;ed to him in the name of Sforza, a &s;cheme for &s;urprizing &s;everal places in that dutchy, by means of the exiles, who, from hatred to the French, and from at|tachment to their former ma&s;ters, were ready for any de&s;perate attempt. Leo not only encouraged the at|tempt, but advanced a con&s;iderable &s;um towards the execution of it; and when through unfore&s;een accidents it failed of &s;ucce&s;s in every part, he allowed the exiles who had a&s;&s;embled in a body, to retire to Reggio, which belonged at that time to the church. The Marechal de Foix, who commanded at Milan in ab&s;ence of his brother Lautrec, who was then in France, tempted with the hopes of catching at once as in a &s;nare, all the

But the vigilance and good conduct of Guicciardini the hi&s;torian, governor of that place, obliged the French general to abandon the enterprize with di&s;grace <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Guic. lib. xiv. 183. Mem. de Bellay, p. 38, &amp;c.</NOTE>. Leo, on receiving this in|telligence, with which he was highly plea&s;ed, as it fur|ni&s;hed him a decent pretext for a rupture with France, immediately a&s;&s;embled the con&s;i&s;tory of Cardinals, and complaining bitterly of the ho&s;tile intentions of the French King, and magnifying the Emperor's zeal for the church, of which he had given a recent proof by his proceedings again&s;t Luther, declared that he was con|&s;trained in &s;elf-defence, and as the only expedient for the &s;ecurity of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate to join his arms to tho&s;e of that prince. For this purpo&s;e, he now pre|tended to conclude a treaty with Don John Manuel, al|though it had been &s;igned &s;ome months before this time; and he publickly excommunicated De Foix, as an im|pious invader of St. Peter's patrimony.</P>
<P>LEO had already begun preparations for war by tak|ing into pay a con&s;iderable body of Swi&s;s; but the Im|perial troops advanced &s;o &s;lowly from Naples and Ger|many, that it was the middle of autumn before the ar|my took the field under the command of Pro&s;per Co|lonna, the mo&s;t eminent of the Italian generals, who&s;e long experience and extreme caution were oppo&s;ed with great propriety to the impetuo&s;ity of the French. In the mean time, De Foix di&s;patched courier after cou|rier to inform the King of the danger which was ap|proaching. Francis, who&s;e forces were either employ|ed in the Low-Countries, or a&s;&s;embling on the frontiers of Spain, and who did not expect &s;o &s;udden an attack in that quarter, &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to his allies the Swi&s;s, to procure from them the immediate levy of an additional body of troops; and commanded Lautrec to repair forth|with to his government. That general who was well acquainted with the great neglect of oeconomy in the admini&s;tration of the King's finances, and who knew how much the troops in the Milane&s;e had already &s;uf|fered

from the want of their pay, refu&s;ed to &s;et out, un|le&s;s the &s;um of three hundred thou&s;and crowns was im|mediately put into his hands. But the King, Loui&s;e of Savoy, his mother, and Semblancay, the &s;uperintendant of finances, having promi&s;ed, even with an oath, that on his arrival at Milan he &s;hould find remittances for the &s;um which he demanded; upon the faith of this he de|parted. Unhappily for France, Loui&s;e, a woman de|ceitful, vindictive, rapacious, and capable of &s;acrificing any thing to the gratification of her pa&s;&s;ions, but who had acquired an ab&s;olute a&s;cendant over her &s;on by her maternal tenderne&s;s, her care of his education, and her great abilities, was re&s;olved not to perform this promi&s;e. Lautrec having incurred her di&s;plea&s;ure by his haughti|ne&s;s in neglecting to pay court to her, and by the free|dom with which he talked concerning &s;ome of her ad|ventures in gallantry, &s;he, in order to deprive him of the honour which he might have gained by a &s;ucce&s;sful de|fence of the Milane&s;e, &s;eized the three hundred thou&s;and crowns de&s;tined for that &s;ervice, and detained them for her own u&s;e.</P>
<P>LAUTREC, notwith&s;tanding this cruel di&s;appointment, found means to a&s;&s;emble a con&s;iderable army, though far inferior in number to that of the confederates. He adopted the plan of defence mo&s;t &s;uitable to his &s;itu|ation, avoiding a pitched battle with the greate&s;t care, while he hara&s;&s;ed the enemy continually with his light troops, beat up their quarters, intercepted their convoys, and covered or relieved every place which they attempt|ed to attack. By this prudent conduct, he not only re|tarded their progre&s;s, but would have &s;oon wearied out the Pope, who had hitherto defrayed almo&s;t the whole expence of the war, as the Emperor, who&s;e revenues in Spain were di&s;&s;ipated during the commotions in that country, and who was obliged to &s;upport a numerous army in the Netherlands, could not make any con&s;i|derable remittances into Italy. But an unfore&s;een acci|dent di&s;concerted all his mea&s;ures, and occa&s;ioned a fatal rever&s;e in the French affairs, A body of twelve thou|&s;and Swi&s;s &s;erved in their army under the banners of the republick, with which France was in alliance. By a law, no le&s;s political than humane, e&s;tabli&s;hed among

The Cardinal of Sion, who &s;till pre&s;erved his intere&s;t among his country|men, and his enmity to France, having prevailed on them to permit a levy of this kind, twelve thou&s;and Swi&s;s joined the army of the confederates. The can|tons, when they &s;aw &s;o many of their countrymen march|ing under ho&s;tile &s;tandards, and ready to de&s;troy each other, became &s;en&s;ible of the infamy to which they would be expo&s;ed, as well as the lo&s;s they might &s;uffer, and di&s;patched couriers, commanding them to leave both armies, and to return into their own country. The Cardinal of Sion, however, had the addre&s;s, by cor|rupting the me&s;&s;engers appointed to carry this order, to prevent its being delivered to the Swi&s;s in the &s;ervice of the confederates; but being intimated in due form to tho&s;e in the French army, they, fatigued with the length of the campaign, and murmuring for want of pay, in&s;tantly yielded obedience in &s;pite of Lautrec's remon&s;trances and intreaties.</P>
<P>AFTER the de&s;ertion of a body which formed the &s;trength of his army, Lautrec dur&s;t no longer face the confederates; and turning towards Milan, encamped on the banks of the Adda, and placed his chief hopes of &s;afety in preventing the enemy from pa&s;&s;ing the river; an expedient for defending a country &s;o precarious, that their are few examples of its being employed with &s;uc|ce&s;s again&s;t any general of experience or abilities. Ac|cordingly Colonna, notwith&s;tanding Lautrec's vigilance and activity, pa&s;&s;ed the Adda with little lo&s;s, and obliged him to &s;hut him&s;elf up within the walls of Milan, which the confederates were preparing to be&s;iege, when an unknown per&s;on, who never afterwards appeared either to boa&s;t of this &s;ervice, or to claim a reward for it, came from the city and acquainted Morone, that if the army would advance that night, the Ghibelline or Imperial faction would put them in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one of the gates. Colonna, though no friend to ra&s;h enterprizes, allowed

the Marquis de Pe&s;cara to advance with the Spani&s;h in|fantry, and he him&s;elf followed with the re&s;t of his troops. About the beginning of night, Pe&s;cara arriving at the Roman gate in the &s;uburbs, &s;urprized the &s;oldiers whom he found there; tho&s;e po&s;ted in the fortifications adjoining to it, immediately fled; the Marquis, &s;eizing the works which they abandoned, and pu&s;hing forward ince&s;&s;antly, though with no le&s;s caution than vigour, be|came ma&s;ter of the city with little blood&s;hed, and almo&s;t without re&s;i&s;tance; the victors being as much a&s;toni&s;hed as the vanqui&s;hed at the facility and &s;ucce&s;s of the at|tempt.

<P>LEO received the accounts of this rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of pro&s;perous events with &s;uch tran&s;ports of joy, as brought on (if we may believe the French hi&s;torians) a &s;light fever, which being neglected, occa&s;ioned his death on the &s;econd of December, while he was &s;till of a vigorous age, and at the height of his glory. By this unexpected accident, the &s;pirit of the confederacy was broken, and its operations &s;u&s;pended. The Cardinals of Sion and Medici left the army that they might be pre&s;ent in the conclave; the Swi&s;s were recalled by their &s;uperiors; &s;ome other mercenaries di&s;banded for want of pay; and only the Spaniards, and a few Germans in the Emperor's &s;ervice, remained to defend the Milane&s;e. But Lautrec, de&s;titute both of men and of money, was unable to im|prove this favourable opportunity in the manner he would have wi&s;hed. The vigilance of Morone, and the good conduct of Colonna, di&s;appointed his feeble at|tempts on the Milane&s;e; and Guicciardini, by his ad|dre&s;s and valour, repul&s;ed a bolder and more dangerous attack which he made on Parma <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Guic. l. xiv. 214.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="011837_0503_0F9D8833736ADB68">MEANWHILE great di&s;cord prevailed in the conclave, which followed upon Leo's death, and all the arts natu|ral to men grown old in intrigue, when contending for a prize &s;o valuable, were practi&s;ed. Wol&s;ey's name, not|with&s;tanding all the Emperor's magnificent promi&s;es to favour his preten&s;ions, of which that prelate did not fail to remind him, was &s;carce mentioned in the conclave. Julio Cardinal de Medici, Leo's nephew, who was more eminent than any other member of the &s;acred college for his abilities, his wealth, and his experience in tran&s;acting great affairs, had already &s;ecured fifteen voices, a num|ber &s;ufficient, according to the forms of the conclave, to exclude any other candidate, though not to carry his own election. All the old Cardinals combined again&s;t him, without being united in favour of any other per&s;on. While the&s;e factions were endeavouring to gain, to cor|rupt, or to weary out each other, Medici and his adhe|rents voted one morning at the &s;crutiny, which according to form was made every day, for Cardinal Adrian of Utrecht, who at that time governed Spain in the Empe|ror's name. This they did merely to protract time; but the adver&s;e party in&s;tantly clo&s;ing with them, to their own amazement and that of all Europe, a &s;tranger to Italy, unknown to the per&s;ons who gave their &s;uf|frages in his favour, and unacquainted with the man|ners of the people, or the intere&s;t of the &s;tate, the go|vernment of which they conferred upon him, was una|nimou&s;ly rai&s;ed to the papal throne, at a juncture &s;o de|licate and critical, as would have demanded all the &s;aga|city and experience of one of the mo&s;t able prelates in the &s;acred college. The Cardinals them&s;elves, unable to give a rea&s;on for this &s;trange choice, on account of which, as they marched in proce&s;&s;ion from the conclave, they were loaded with in&s;ults and cur&s;es by the Roman people, a&s;cribed it to an immediate impul&s;e of the Holy Gho&s;t. It may be imputed with greater certainty to the influence of Don John Manuel, the Imperial amba&s;&s;ador, who by his addre&s;s and intrigues facilitated the election of a per&s;on devoted to his ma&s;ter's &s;ervice, from grati|tude, from intere&s;t, and from inclination <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ger.

<P><PB N="96" REF="011837_0504_0F9D883433F6B048">BESIDES the influence which Charles acquired by Adrian's promotion, it threw great lu&s;tre on his admini|&s;tration. To be&s;tow on his preceptor &s;uch a noble re|compence, and to place on the papal throne a creature whom he had rai&s;ed, were acts of uncommon magnifi|cence and power. Francis ob&s;erved, with the &s;en&s;ibi|lity of a rival, the pre-eminence which he was gaining, and re&s;olved to exert him&s;elf with fre&s;h vigour, in order to wre&s;t from him his late conque&s;ts in Italy. The Swi&s;s, in order to make &s;ome reparation to the French King, for having &s;o un&s;ea&s;onably withdrawn their troops from his army, which had occa&s;ioned the lo&s;s of the Mi|lane&s;e, permitted him to levy ten thou&s;and men in the republick. Together with this reinforcement, Lautrec received from the King a &s;mall &s;um in money, which enabled him once more to take the field, and after &s;eiz|ing by &s;urprize, or force, &s;everal places in the Milane&s;e, to advance within a few miles of the capital. The con|federate army was in no condition to ob&s;truct his pro|gre&s;s; and though the inhabitants of Milan, inflamed by the artifices of Morone, and by the popular declama|tions of a monk whom he employed, with the mo&s;t en|thu&s;ia&s;tic zeal again&s;t the French government, con&s;ented to rai&s;e extraordinary contributions, Colonna mu&s;t &s;oon have abandoned the advantageous camp he had cho&s;en at Bicocca, and have di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his troops for want of pay, if the Swi&s;s in the French &s;ervice had not once more ex|tricated him out of his difficulties.</P>
<P>THE in&s;olence and caprice of that people were often no le&s;s fatal to their friends, than their valour and di&s;|cipline were formidable to their enemies. Having now &s;erved two months without pay, of which they com|plained loudly, a &s;um de&s;tined for their u&s;e was &s;ent from France under a convoy of hor&s;e; but Morone, who&s;e vigilant eye nothing e&s;caped, po&s;ted a body of troops in their way, &s;o that tho&s;e who e&s;corted the mo|ney dur&s;t not advance. On receiving intelligence of this, the Swi&s;s lo&s;t all patience, and officers as well as &s;oldiers crowding around Lautrec, threatened with one voice in&s;tantly to retire, if he did not either advance the pay which was due, or promi&s;e to lead them next morning to battle. In vain did Lautrec remon&s;trate
<PB N="97" REF="011837_0505_0F9D8834F0EBDD60">
again&s;t the&s;e demands, repre&s;enting to them the impo&s;|&s;ibility of the former, and the ra&s;hne&s;s of the latter, which mu&s;t be attended with certain de&s;truction, as the enemy occupied a camp naturally of great &s;trength, and which by art they had rendered almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible. The Swi&s;s, deaf to rea&s;on, and per&s;uaded that their va|lour was capable of &s;urmounting every ob&s;tactle, re|newed their demand with greater fiercene&s;s, offering them&s;elves to form the van-guard, and to begin the at|tack. Lautrec, unable to overcome their ob&s;tinacy, complied with their reque&s;t, hoping, perhaps, that &s;ome of tho&s;e unfore&s;een accidents which &s;o often determine the fate of battles, might crown this ra&s;h enterprize with unde&s;erved &s;ucce&s;s; and convinced that the effects of a defeat could not be more fatal than tho&s;e which would certainly follow upon the retreat of a body which com|po&s;ed one half of his army. Next morning the Swi&s;s were early in the field, and marched with the greate&s;t int e|pidity again&s;t an enemy deeply entrenched on every &s;ide, &s;urrounded with artillery, and prepared to receive them. As they advanced, they &s;u&s;tained a furious cannonade with great firmne&s;s, and without waiting for their own artillery, ru&s;hed impetuou&s;ly upon the intrenchments. But after incredible efforts of valour, &s;econded with great &s;pirit by the French, having lo&s;t their brave&s;t of|ficers and be&s;t troops, and finding that they could make no impre&s;&s;ion on the enemy's works, they &s;ounded a retreat; leaving the field of battle, however, like men repul&s;ed, but not vanqui&s;hed, in clo&s;e array, and with|out receiving any mole&s;tation from the enemy.</P>
<P>NEXT day, &s;uch as &s;urvived &s;et out for their own country; and Lautrec, de&s;pairing of being able to make any farther re&s;i&s;tance, retired into France, after throwing garri&s;ons into Cremona, and a few other places; all which, except the citadel of Cremona, Co|lonna &s;oon obliged to &s;urrender.</P>
<P>GENOA, however, and its territories, remaining &s;ubject to France, &s;till gave Francis con&s;iderable footing in Italy, and made it ea&s;y for him to execute any &s;cheme for the recovery of the Milane&s;e. But Colonna, rendered en|terprizing by continual &s;ucce&s;s, and excited by the &s;oli|citations of the faction of the Adorni, the hereditary

<P>SUCH a cruel &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of misfortunes affected Fran|cis with deep concern, which was not a little augmented by the unexpected arrival of an Engli&s;h herald, who, in the name of his &s;overeign, declared war in form again&s;t France. This &s;tep was taken in con&s;equence of the treaty Wol&s;ey had concluded with the Emperor at Bru|ges, and which had hitherto been kept &s;ecret. Francis, though he had rea&s;on to be &s;urprized with this denun|ciation, after having been at &s;uch pains to &s;ooth Hen|ry and to gain his mini&s;ter, received the herald with great compo&s;ure and dignity<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Journal de Loui&s;e de Savoie, p. 199.</NOTE>; and without abandon|ing any of the &s;chemes he was forming again&s;t the Em|peror, began vigorous preparations for re&s;i&s;ting this new enemy. His trea&s;ury, however, being exhau&s;ted by the efforts which he had already made, as well as by the &s;ums he expended on his plea&s;ures, he had recour&s;e to extraordinary expedients for &s;upplying it. Several new offices were created, and expo&s;ed to &s;ale; the royal de|me&s;nes were alienated; unu&s;ual taxes were impo&s;ed; and the tomb of St. Martin was &s;tripped of a rail of ma&s;&s;ive &s;ilver, with which Lewis XI. in one of his fits of devotion, had encircled it. By means of the&s;e expe|dients he was enabled to levy a con&s;iderable army, and to put the frontier towns in a good po&s;ture of defence.</P>
<P>THE Emperor, meanwhile, was no le&s;s &s;olicitous to draw as much advantage as po&s;&s;ible from the ac|ce&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a powerful ally; and the pro&s;perous &s;ituation of his affairs, at this time, permitting him to &s;et out for Spain, where his pre&s;ence was extremely nece&s;&s;ary, he vi&s;ited the court of England in his way to
<PB N="99" REF="011837_0507_0F9D883675802EA8">
that country. He propo&s;ed by this interview not only to &s;trengthen the bonds of friend&s;hip which united him and Henry, and to excite him to pu&s;h the war again&s;t France with vigour, but hoped to remove any di&s;gu&s;t or re&s;entment Wol&s;ey might have conceived on account of the cruel di&s;appointment which he had met with in the late conclave. His &s;ucce&s;s exceeded his mo&s;t &s;an|guine expectations; and by his artful addre&s;s, during a re&s;idence of &s;ix weeks in England, he gained not only the King and the Mini&s;ter, but the nation it&s;elf. Hen|ry, who&s;e vanity was &s;en&s;ibly flattered by &s;uch a vi&s;it, as well as by the &s;tudied re&s;pect with which the Empe|ror treated him on every occa&s;ion, entered warmly into all his &s;chemes. The Cardinal, fore&s;eeing from Adri|an's age and infirmities, a &s;udden vacancy in the papal &s;ee, di&s;&s;embled or forgot his re&s;entment; and as Charles augmented the pen&s;ions which he had already &s;ettled on him, and renewed his promi&s;e of favouring his preten|&s;ions to the papacy, with all his intere&s;t, he endeavour|ed to merit the former, and to &s;ecure the accompli&s;h|ment of the latter, by fre&s;h &s;ervices. The nation, &s;har|ing in the glory of its monarch, and plea&s;ed with the confidence which the Emperor placed in the Engli&s;h by creating the Earl of Surrey, his High-Admiral, di&s;|covered no le&s;s inclination to commence ho&s;tilities than Henry him&s;elf.</P>
<P>IN order to give Charles, before he left England, a proof of this general ardour, Surrey &s;ailed with &s;uch forces as were ready, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">vaged the coa&s;ts of Norman|dy. He then made a de&s;cent on Bretagne, where he plundered and burnt Morlaix, and &s;ome other places of le&s;s con&s;equence. After the&s;e &s;light excur&s;ions, attend|ed with greater di&s;honour than damage to France, he repaired to Calais and took the command of the princi|pal army, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ixteen thou&s;and men; with which having joined the Flemi&s;h troops under the Count de Buren, he advanced into Picardy. The army which Francis had a&s;&s;embled, was far inferior in number to the&s;e united bodies. But during the long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ars between the two nations the French had di&s;covered the proper method of defending their country again&s;t the Engli&s;h. They had been taught by their misfortunes to avoid a

pitched battle with the utmo&s;t care, and to endeavour, by throwing garri&s;ons into every place capable of re|&s;i&s;tance, by watching all the enemy's motions, by in|tercepting their convoys, attacking their advanced po&s;ts, and hara&s;&s;ing them continually with their numerous cavalry, to ruin them with the length of the war, or to beat them by piece-meal. This plan the duke of Ven|dome, the French general in Picardy, pur&s;ued with no le&s;s prudence than &s;ucce&s;s; and not only prevented Sur|rey from taking any town of importance, but obliged him to retire with his army greatly reduced by fatigue, by want of provi&s;ions, and by the lo&s;s it had &s;u&s;tained in &s;everal un&s;ucce&s;sful &s;kirmi&s;hes.</P>
<P>THUS ended the &s;econd campaign, in a war the mo&s;t general that hitherto had been kindled in Europe; and though Francis by his mother's ill-timed re&s;entment, by the di&s;gu&s;ting in&s;olence of his general, and the ca|price of the mercenary troops he employed, had lo&s;t his conque&s;ts in Italy, yet all the powers combined again&s;t him had not been able to make any impre&s;&s;ion on his hereditary dominions; and wherever they either intend|ed or attempted an attack, he was well prepared to re|ceive them.</P>
<P>WHILE the Chri&s;tian Princes were thus wa&s;ting each others &s;trength, Solyman the Magnificent, entered Hun|gary with a numerous army, and inve&s;ting Belgrade, which was deemed the chief barrier of that kingdom again&s;t the Turki&s;h arms, &s;oon forced it to &s;urrender. Encouraged by this &s;ucce&s;s, he turned his victorious arms again&s;t the i&s;land of Rhodes, the &s;eat, at that time, of the Knights of St. John of Jeru&s;alem. This &s;mall &s;tate he attacked with &s;uch a numerous army, as the Lords of A&s;ia have been accu&s;tomed in every age to bring into the field. Two hundred thou&s;and men, and a fleet of four hundred &s;ail appeared again&s;t a town de|fended by a garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ting of five thou&s;and &s;oldiers, and &s;ix hundred Knights, under the command of Vil|liers de L'i&s;le Adam, the Grand Ma&s;ter, who&s;e wi&s;dom and valour rendered him worthy of that &s;tation at &s;uch a dangerous juncture. No &s;ooner did he begin to &s;u&s;|pect the de&s;tination of Solyman's va&s;t armaments, than he di&s;patched me&s;&s;engers to all the Chri&s;tian courts, im|ploring

their aid again&s;t the common enemy. But though every Prince in that age, acknowledged Rhodes to be the great bulwark of Chri&s;tendom in the ea&s;t, and tru&s;ted to the gallantry of its Knights as the be&s;t &s;ecu|rity again&s;t the progre&s;s of the Ottoman arms; and though Adrian, with a zeal which became the head and father of the church, exhorted the contending powers, to forget their private quarrels, and by uniting their arms, to prevent the Infidels from de&s;troying a &s;ociety which did honour to the Chri&s;tian name; yet &s;o violent and implacable was the animo&s;ity of both parties, that, regardle&s;s of the danger to which they expo&s;ed all Eu|rope, and unmoved by the intreaties of the Grand Ma|&s;ter, or the admonitions of the Pope, they &s;uffered So|lyman, without di&s;turbance, to carry on his operations again&s;t Rhodes. The Grand Ma&s;ter, after incredible efforts of courage, of patience, and of military conduct during a &s;iege of &s;ix months; after &s;u&s;taining many a&s;&s;aults, and di&s;puting every po&s;t with amazing ob&s;tina|cy, was obliged at la&s;t to yield to numbers, and having obtained an honourable capitulation from the Sultan, who admired and re&s;pected his virtue, he &s;urrendered the town, which was reduced to a heap of rubbi&s;h, and de&s;titute of every re&s;ource <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Fontanus de Bello Rhodio ap.

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE REIGN OF THE EMPEROR CHARLES V. BOOK III.</HEAD>
<P>CHARLES, having had the &s;ati&s;faction of &s;eeing ho&s;tilities begun between France and England, took leave of Henry, and arrived in Spain on the &s;eventeenth of June. He found that country ju&s;t beginning to recover order and &s;trength after the mi&s;eries of a civil war to which it had been expo&s;ed during his ab&s;ence; an account of the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of which, as it was but little connected with the other events that happened in Europe, hath been re&s;erved to this place.</P>
<P>NO &s;ooner was it known that the Cortes a&s;&s;embled in Galicia had voted the Emperor a <HI>free-gift,</HI> without obtaining the redre&s;s of any grievance, than it excited univer&s;al indignation. The citizens of Toledo, who con&s;idered them&s;elves, on account of the great privileges which they enjoyed, as guardians of the liberties of the Ca&s;tilian commons, finding that no regard was paid to the remon&s;trances of their deputies again&s;t that un|con&s;titutional grant, took arms with tumultuary vio|lence, and &s;eizing the gates of the city which were for|tified, attacked the al-cazar, or ca&s;tle, which they &s;oon obliged the governor to &s;urrender.

this &s;ucce&s;s, they deprived of all authority every per&s;on whom they &s;u&s;pected of any attachment to the court, e&s;tabli&s;hed a popular form of government, compo&s;ed of deputies from the &s;everal pari&s;hes in the city, and levied troops in their own defence. The chief leader of the people in the&s;e in&s;urrections was Don John de Padilla, the elde&s;t &s;on of the commendador of Ca&s;tile, a young nobleman of a generous temper, of undaunted courage, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the talents as well as of the ambition which in times of civil di&s;cord rai&s;e men to power and eminence<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sandov. p. 77.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE re&s;entment of the citizens of Segovia produced effects &s;till more fatal. Torde&s;illas, one of their repre|&s;entatives in the late Cortes, had voted for the donative; and being a bold and haughty man, ventured, upon his return, to call together his fellow citizens in the great church, that he might give them, according to cu&s;tom, an account of his conduct in that a&s;&s;embly. But the multitude, unable to bear his in&s;olence, in attempting to ju&s;tify what they thought inexcu&s;able, bur&s;t open the gates of the church with the utmo&s;t fury, and &s;eizing the unhappy Torde&s;illas, dragged him through the &s;treets, with a thou&s;and cur&s;es and in&s;ults, towards the place of publick execution. In vain did the dean and canons come forth in proce&s;&s;ion with the holy &s;acrame<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, in order to appea&s;e their rage. In vain did the monks of tho&s;e mona&s;teries by which they pa&s;&s;ed, conjure them on their knees to &s;pare his life, or at lea&s;t to allow him time to confe&s;s, and to receive ab&s;olution of his &s;ins. Without li&s;tening to the dictates either of humanity or of religion, they cried out, "That the hangman alone could ab|&s;olve &s;uch a traitor to his country," hurried him along with greater violence, and finding that he had expired under their hands, they hung him up with his head downward on the common gibbet <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">P.

<P>ADRIAN, at that time regent of Spain, had &s;carce fixed the &s;eat of his government at Valladolid, when he was alarmed with an account of the&s;e in&s;urrections. He immediately a&s;&s;embled the council to deliberate concern|ing the proper method of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing them. The coun|&s;ellors differed in opinion; &s;ome in&s;i&s;ting it was nece&s;|&s;ary to check this audacious &s;pirit in its infancy by a &s;e|vere execution of ju&s;tice; others advi&s;ing to treat with lenity a people who had &s;ome rea&s;on to be incen&s;ed, and not to drive them beyond all the bounds of duty by an ill-timed rigour. The &s;entiments of the former being warmly &s;upported by the archbi&s;hop of Granada, pre&s;i|dent of the council, a per&s;on of great authority, but cho|lerick and impetuous, were approved of by Adrian, who&s;e zeal to &s;upport his ma&s;ter's authority hurried him into a mea&s;ure, to which, from his natural caution and timidity, he would otherwi&s;e have been aver&s;e. He commanded Ronquillo, one of the King's judges, to re|pair in&s;tantly to Segovia, which had &s;et the fir&s;t exam|ple of mutiny, and to proceed again&s;t the delinquents according to law; and le&s;t the people &s;hould be &s;o out|rageous as to re&s;i&s;t his authority, a con&s;iderable body of troops was appointed to attend him. The Segovians, fore&s;eeing what they might expect from a judge &s;o well known for his au&s;tere and unforgiving temper, took arms with one con&s;ent, and having mu&s;tered twelve thou&s;and men, &s;hut their gates again&s;t him. Ronquil|lo, enraged at this in&s;ult, denounced them rebels and outlaws; and his troops &s;eizing all the avenues to the town, hoped that it would &s;oon be obliged to &s;urrender for want of provi&s;ions. The inhabitants, however, de|fended them&s;elves with vigour, and having received a con&s;iderable reinforcement from Toledo, under the command of Padilla, attacked Ronquillo, and forced him to retire, with the lo&s;s of his baggage and military che&s;t <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Sandov. 112.

<P><PB N="105" REF="011837_0513_0F9D883AF1020D10">UPON this Adrian ordered Antonio de Fon&s;eca, whom the Emperor had appointed commander in chief of the forces in Spain, to a&s;&s;emble an army, and to be|&s;iege the city in form. But the inhabitants of Medina del Campo, where Cardinal Ximenes had e&s;tabli&s;hed a va&s;t magazine of military &s;tores, would not &s;uffer him to draw from it a train of battering cannon, or to de&s;troy their countrymen with tho&s;e arms which had been pre|pared again&s;t the enemies of the kingdom. Fon&s;eca, who could not execute his orders without artillery, de|termined to &s;eize the magazine by force, and the citi|zens &s;tanding on their defence, he a&s;&s;aulted the town with great bri&s;kne&s;s: But his troops were &s;o warmly re|ceived, that de&s;pairing of carrying the place, he &s;et fire to &s;ome of the hou&s;es, in hopes that the citizens would abandon the walls in order to &s;ave their families and ef|fects. In&s;tead of that, the expedient to which he had recour&s;e &s;erved only to increa&s;e their fury, and he was repul&s;ed with great infamy, while the flames &s;preading from &s;treet to &s;treet, reduced to a&s;hes almo&s;t the whole town, one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable at that time in Spain, and the great mart for the manufactures of Segovia, and &s;everal other cities. As the warehou&s;es were then filled with goods for the approaching fair, the lo&s;s was im|men&s;e, and was felt univer&s;ally; and this, added to the impre&s;&s;ion which &s;uch a cruel action made on people long unaccu&s;tomed to the horrors of civil war, enraged the Ca&s;tilians almo&s;t to madne&s;s. Fon&s;eca became the object of general indignation, and was branded with the name of incendiary and enemy to his country; and even the citizens of Valladolid, whom the pre&s;ence of the Cardinal had hitherto re&s;trained, declared that they could no longer remain inactive &s;pectators of the &s;ufferings of their countrymen, and taking arms with no le&s;s fury than the other cities, they burnt Fon&s;eca's hou&s;e to the ground, elected new magi&s;trates, rai&s;ed &s;oldiers, ap|pointed officers to command them, and guarded their walls with as much diligence, as if an enemy had been ready to attack them.</P>
<P>THE Cardinal, who though virtuous and di&s;intere&s;ted, and capable of governing the kingdom with honour in times of tranquillity, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed neither the courage nor
<PB N="106" REF="011837_0514_0F9D883BB5E4DC18">
&s;agacity nece&s;&s;ary at &s;uch a dangerous juncture, finding him&s;elf unable to check the&s;e outrages committed under his own eye, attempted to appea&s;e the people, by pro|te&s;ting that Fon&s;eca had exceeded his orders, and had by his ra&s;h conduct offended him, as much as he had in|jured them. This conde&s;cen&s;ion, the effect of irre&s;olu|tion and timidity, rendered the malecontents bolder and more in&s;olent; and the Cardinal having &s;oon after re|called Fon&s;eca, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his troops, which he could no longer afford to pay, as the trea&s;ury had been drain|ed by the rapaciou&s;ne&s;s of the Flemi&s;h mini&s;ters, and re|ceived no &s;upply from the great cities which were all in arms, the people were left at full liberty to act without controul, and &s;carce any &s;hadow of power remained in his hands.</P>
<P>NOR were the proceedings of the commons the ef|fects merely of popular and tumultuary rage; they aimed at obtaining redre&s;s of their political grievances, and an e&s;tabli&s;hment of publick liberty on a &s;ecure ba|&s;is, objects worthy of all the zeal they di&s;covered in con|tending for them. The feudal government in Spain, was at that time in a &s;tate more favourable to liberty than in any other of the great European kingdoms. This was owing chiefly to the number of great cities in that country, a circum&s;tance of which I have already taken no|tice, and which contributes more than any other to miti|gate the rigour of the feudal in&s;titutions, and to introduce a more liberal and equal form of government. The inha|bitants of every city formed a great corporation with va|luable immunities and privileges; they were admitted to a con&s;iderable &s;hare in the legi&s;lature; they acquired the arts of indu&s;try, without which cities cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t; they accumulated wealth, by engaging in commerce; and being free and independent them&s;elves, were the guardians of the publick freedom and independence. The genius of the internal government e&s;tabli&s;hed in cities, which, even in countries where de&s;potic power prevails mo&s;t, is democratical and republican, rendered the idea of liberty familiar and dear to them. Their re|pre&s;entatives in the Cortes were accu&s;tomed to check with equal &s;pirit the encroachments of the King, and the oppre&s;&s;ion of the nobles. They endeavoured to
<PB N="107" REF="011837_0515_0F9D883C71265DF0">
extend the privileges of their own order; they laboured to &s;hake off the remaining encumbrances with which the feudal tyranny had burdened them; and con&s;cious of being one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable orders in the &s;tate, were ambitious of becoming the mo&s;t powerful.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ent juncture appeared favourable for pu&s;h|ing any new claim. Their Sovereign was ab&s;ent from his dominions; by the ill conduct of his mini&s;ters he had lo&s;t the e&s;teem and affection of his &s;ubjects; the people exa&s;perated by many injuries, had taken up arms, though without concert, almo&s;t by general con&s;ent; they were animated with fury capable of carrying them to the mo&s;t violent extremes; the royal trea&s;ury was ex|hau&s;ted; the kingdom de&s;titute of troops; and the go|vernment committed to a &s;tranger, of great virtue in|deed, but of abilities unequal to &s;uch a tru&s;t. The fir&s;t care of Padilla, and the other popular leaders who ob|&s;erved and determined to improve the&s;e circum&s;tances, was to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ome form of union or a&s;&s;ociation among the malecontents, that they might act with greater regu|larity and pur&s;ue one common end; and as the differ|ent cities had been prompted to take arms by the &s;ame motives, and were accu&s;tomed to con&s;ider them&s;elves as a di&s;tinct body from the re&s;t of the &s;ubjects, they did not find this difficult. A general convention was appointed to be held at Avila. Deputies appeared there in name of almo&s;t all the cities intitled to have repre&s;entatives in the Cortes. They all bound them&s;elves by &s;olemn oath, to live and die in the &s;ervice of the King, and in de|fence of the privileges of their order; and a&s;&s;uming the name of the holy <HI>Junta</HI> or a&s;&s;ociation, proceeded to de|liberate concerning the &s;tate of the nation, and the pro|per method of redre&s;&s;ing its grievances. The fir&s;t that naturally pre&s;ented it&s;elf, was the nomination of a fo|reigner to be regent; this, they declared with one voice to be a violation of the fundamental laws of the king|dom, and re&s;olved to &s;end a deputation of their mem|bers to Adrian, requiring him in their name to lay a&s;ide all the en&s;igns of his office, and to ab&s;tain for the future from the exerci&s;e of a juri&s;diction which they had pro|nounced illegal <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">P.

<P><PB N="108" REF="011837_0516_0F9D883D38B73DC8">WHILE they were preparing to execute this bold re|&s;olution, Padilla accompli&s;hed an enterprize of the greate&s;t advantage to the cau&s;e. After relieving Sego|via, he marched &s;uddenly to Torde&s;illas, the place where the unhappy Queen Joanna had re&s;ided &s;ince the death of her hu&s;band, and being favoured by the in|habitants, was admitted into the town, and became ma&s;ter of her per&s;on, for the &s;ecurity of which Adrian had neglected to take proper precautions <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Vita dell.

Padilla waited immediately upon the Queen, and acco&s;ting her with that profound re&s;pect, which &s;he exacted from the few per&s;ons whom &s;he deigned to admit into her pre|&s;ence, acquainted her at large with the mi&s;erable condi|tion of her Ca&s;tilian &s;ubjects under the government of her &s;on, who being de&s;titute of experience him&s;elf, per|mitted his foreign mini&s;ters to treat them with &s;uch rigour, as had obliged them to take arms in defence of the liberties of their country. The Queen, as if &s;he had been awakened out of a lethargy, expre&s;&s;ed great a&s;to|ni&s;hment at what he &s;aid, and told him, that as &s;he had never heard till that moment of the death of her father, or known the &s;ufferings of her people, no blame could be imputed to her, but that now &s;he would take care to provide a &s;ufficient remedy; and in the mean time, add|ed &s;he, let it be your concern to do what is nece&s;&s;ary for the public welfare. Padilla, too eager in forming a conclu&s;ion agreeable to his wi&s;hes, mi&s;took this lucid in|terval of rea&s;on for a perfect return of that faculty; and acquainting the Junta with what had happened, ad|vi&s;ed them to remove to Torde&s;illas, and to hold their meetings in that place. This was in&s;tantly done; but though Joanna received very graciou&s;ly an addre&s;s of the Junta, be&s;eeching her to take upon her the government of the kingdom, and in token of her compliance, ad|mitted all the deputies to ki&s;s her hand; though &s;he was pre&s;ent at a tournament held on that occa&s;ion, and &s;eemed highly &s;atisfied with both the&s;e ceremonies, which were conducted with great magnificence in order to plea&s;e her, &s;he &s;oon relap&s;ed into her former melan|choly and fullenne&s;s, and could never be brought by

<P>THE Junta concealing as much as po&s;&s;ible this la&s;t circum&s;tance, carried on all their deliberations in her name; and as the Ca&s;tilians, who idolized the memory of I&s;abella, retained a wonderful attachment to her daughter, no &s;ooner was it known that &s;he had con&s;ented to a&s;&s;ume the reigns of government, than the people ex|pre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t univer&s;al and immoderate joy; and believing her recovery to be compleat, a&s;cribed it to a miraculous interpo&s;ition of heaven, in order to re&s;cue their country from the oppre&s;&s;ion of foreigners. The Junta, con&s;cious of the reputation and power they had acquired by &s;eeming to act under the royal authority, were no longer &s;atisfied with requiring Adrian to re&s;ign the office of regent, they detached Padilla to Valado|lid with a con&s;iderable body of troops, ordering him to &s;eize &s;uch members of the council as were &s;till in that city, to conduct them to Torde&s;illas, and to bring away the &s;eals of the kingdom, the public archieves and trea|&s;ury books. Padilla, who was received by the citizens, as the deliverer of his country, executed his commi&s;&s;ion with great exactne&s;s; permitting Adrian, however, &s;till to re&s;ide in Valadolid, though only as a private per&s;on, and without any &s;hadow of power <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Sandov. 174.

<P>THE Emperor, to whom frequent accounts of the&s;e tran&s;actions were tran&s;mitted while he was &s;till in Flan|ders, was &s;en&s;ible of his own imprudence and that of his mini&s;ters in having de&s;pi&s;ed too long the murmurs and remon&s;trances of the Ca&s;tilians. He beheld, with deep concern, a kingdom the mo&s;t valuable of any he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, and in which lay the &s;trength and &s;inews of his power, ju&s;t ready to di&s;own his authority, and on the point of being plunged in all the mi&s;eries of civil war. But though his pre&s;ence might have averted this cala|mity, he could not at that time, vi&s;it Spain without en|dangering the imperial crown, and allowing the French King full lei&s;ure to execute his ambitious &s;chemes. The only points now to be deliberated upon, were, whether

<P>THE conce&s;&s;ions he was willing to make, which, at the time of his leaving Spain, would have fully &s;atisfied the people, came now too late to produce any effect. The Junta, relying on the unanimity with which the nation &s;ubmitted to their authority, elated with the &s;uc|ce&s;s which hitherto had accompanied all their under|takings, and &s;eeing no military force collected to defeat or ob&s;truct their de&s;igns, aimed at a more thorough re|formation of political abu&s;es.

in the admini&s;tration of government, fur|ni&s;hes us with more authentic evidence concerning the intentions of the Junta, than can be drawn from the te&s;ti|mony of the latter Spani&s;h hi&s;torians, who lived in times when it became fa&s;hionable and even nece&s;&s;ary to repre|&s;ent the conduct of the malecontents in the wor&s;t light, and as flowing from the wor&s;t motives. After a long preamble concerning the various calamities under which the nation groaned, and the errors and corruption in go|vernment to which the&s;e were to be imputed, they take notice of the exemplary patience wherewith the people had endured them, till &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, and the duty which they owed to their country, had obliged them to a&s;&s;emble in order to provide in a legal manner for their own &s;afety, and that of the con&s;titution: For this pur|po&s;e they demanded that the King would be plea&s;ed to return to his Spani&s;h dominions, and re&s;ide there, as all their former monarchs had done; that he would not marry but with con&s;ent of the Cortes; that if he &s;hould be obliged at any time to leave the kingdom, it &s;hall not be lawful to appoint any foreigner to be regent; that the pre&s;ent nomination of Cardinal Adrian to that office &s;hall in&s;tantly be declared void; that he would not, at his return, bring along with him any Flemings or other &s;trangers; that no foreign troops &s;hall, on any pretence whatever, be introduced into the kingdom; that none but natives &s;hall be capable of holding any office or benefice either in church or &s;tate; that no fo|reigners &s;hall be naturalized; that free quarters &s;hall not be granted to &s;oldiers, nor to tho&s;e of the King's hou&s;|hold for any longer time than &s;ix days, and that only when the court is in a progre&s;s; that all the taxes &s;hall be reduced to the &s;ame &s;tate they were in at the death of Queen I&s;abella; that all alienations of the royal de|me&s;nes or revenues &s;ince that Queen's death &s;hall be re|&s;umed; that all new offices created &s;ince that period be aboli&s;hed; that the &s;ub&s;idy granted by the late Cortes in Galicia &s;hall not be exacted; that in all future Cortes each city &s;hall &s;end one repre&s;entative of the clergy, one of the gentry, and one of the commons, each to be elected by his own order; that the crown &s;hall not in|fluence or direct any city with regard to the choice of its

<P>SUCH were the chief articles pre&s;ented by the Junta to their Sovereign. As the feudal in&s;titutions in the &s;everal kingdoms of Europe were originally the &s;ame, the genius of tho&s;e governments which aro&s;e from them bore a &s;trong re&s;emblance to each other, and the regu|lations which the Ca&s;tilians attempted to e&s;tabli&s;h on this occa&s;ion, differ little from tho&s;e which other nations la|boured to procure in their &s;truggles with their monarchs for liberty. The grievances complained of, and the remedies propo&s;ed by the Engli&s;h commons in their conte&s;ts with the princes of the hou&s;e of Stuart, parti|cularly re&s;emble tho&s;e upon which the Junta now in&s;i&s;t|ed. But the Spaniards had already acquired ideas of their own liberty and independence, had formed bold and generous &s;entiments concerning government, and di&s;covered an extent of political knowledge to which the Engli&s;h did not attain till more than a century after|wards.</P>
<P>IT is not improbable, however, that the &s;pirit of re|formation among the Ca&s;tilians, hitherto unre&s;trained by authority, and emboldened by &s;ucce&s;s, became too impetuous, and prompted the Junta to propo&s;e innova|tions, which, by alarming the other members of the con&s;titution, proved fatal to their cau&s;e. The nobles, who, in&s;tead of ob&s;tructing, had favoured or connived at their proceedings, while they confined their demands of redre&s;s to &s;uch grievances as had been occa&s;ioned by the King's want of experience, and by the imprudence and rapaciou&s;ne&s;s of his foreign mini&s;ters, were filled with indignation when they began to touch the privileges of
<PB N="114" REF="011837_0522_0F9D8842CAC1CCA8">
their order, and plainly &s;aw that the mea&s;ures of the commons tended no le&s;s to break the power of the ari&s;|tocracy, than to limit the prerogatives of the crown. The re&s;entment which they had conceived on account of Adrian's promotion to the regency, abated con&s;ider|ably upon the Emperor's rai&s;ing the con&s;table and ad|miral to a joint power with him in that office; and as their pride and dignity were le&s;s hurt by &s;uffering the Prince to po&s;&s;e&s;s an exten&s;ive prerogative, than by ad|mitting the high preten&s;ions of the people, they deter|mined to give their Sovereign the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which he had demanded of them, and began to a&s;&s;emble their va&s;&s;als for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>THE Junta, meanwhile, expected with impatience the Emperor's an&s;wer to their remon&s;trance, which they had appointed &s;ome of their number to pre&s;ent. The mem|bers entru&s;ted with this commi&s;&s;ion &s;et out immediately for Germany, but having received at different places certain intelligence from court, that they could not ven|ture to appear there without endangering their lives, they &s;topt &s;hort in their journey, and acquainted the Junta of the information which had been given them <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Sandov. 143.</NOTE>. This excited &s;uch violent pa&s;&s;ions as tran&s;ported the whole party beyond all bounds of prudence, or of mo|deration. That a Ca&s;tilian King &s;hould deny his &s;ub|jects acce&s;s into his pre&s;ence, or refu&s;e to li&s;ten to their humble petitions, was repre&s;ented as an act of tyranny &s;o unprecedented and intolerable, that nothing now re|mained but with arms in their hands to drive away that ravenous band of foreigners which encompa&s;&s;ed the throne, who, after having devoured the wealth of the kingdom, found it nece&s;&s;ary to prevent the cries of an injured people from reaching the ears of their Sovereign. Many in&s;i&s;ted warmly on approving a motion which had formerly been made, for depriving Charles, during the life of his mother, of the regal titles and authority which had been too ra&s;hly conferred upon him from a fal&s;e &s;uppo&s;ition of her total inability for government. Some propo&s;ed to provide a proper per&s;on to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in the admini&s;tration of public affairs, by marrying the Queen

to the Prince of Calabria, the heir of the Aragone&s;e Kings of Naples, who had been detained in pri&s;on &s;ince the time that Ferdinand had di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his ance&s;tors of their crown. All agreed, that as the hopes of obtaining redre&s;s and &s;ecurity merely by pre&s;enting their reque&s;ts to their Sovereign, had kept them too long in a &s;tate of inaction, and prevented them from taking advantage of the unanimity with which the nation declared in their fa|vour, it was now nece&s;&s;ary to collect their whole force, and to exert them&s;elves with vigour, in oppo&s;ing this fatal combination of the King and nobles again&s;t their liberties <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">P.

<P>THEY &s;oon took the field with twenty thou&s;and men. Violent di&s;putes aro&s;e concerning the command of this army. Padilla, the darling of the people and &s;oldiers, was the only per&s;on whom they thought worthy of this honour. But Don Pedro de Giron, the elde&s;t &s;on of the Cond&egrave; de Uruena, a young nobleman of the fir&s;t order, having lately joined the commons out of private re|&s;entment again&s;t the Emperor, the re&s;pect due to his birth, together with a &s;ecret de&s;ire of di&s;appointing Pa|dilla, of who&s;e popularity many of the Junta had become jealous, procured him the office of general; though he &s;oon gave them a fatal proof that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed neither the experience, the abilities, nor the &s;teadine&s;s which that important &s;tation required.</P>
<P>THE regents, meanwhile, appointed Rio&s;eco as the place of rendezvous for their troops, which, though far inferior to tho&s;e of the commons in number, excelled them greatly in di&s;cipline and in valour. They had drawn a con&s;iderable body of regular and veteran in|fantry out of Navarre. Their cavalry, which formed the chief &s;trength of their army, con&s;i&s;ted mo&s;tly of gen|tlemen accu&s;tomed to the military life, and animated with the martial &s;pirit peculiar to their order in that age. The infantry of the Junta was formed entirely of citi|zens and mechanics, little acquainted with the u&s;e of arms. The &s;mall body of cavalry they had been able to rai&s;e, was compo&s;ed of per&s;ons of ignoble birth, and perfect &s;trangers to the &s;ervice into which they entered.

The character of the generals differed no le&s;s than that of their troops. The royali&s;ts were commanded by the Cond&egrave; de Haro, the con&s;table's elde&s;t &s;on, an officer of great experience, and of di&s;tingui&s;hed abilities.</P>
<P>GIRON marched with his army directly to Rio&s;eco and &s;eizing the villages and pa&s;&s;es around it, hoped that the royali&s;ts would be obliged either to &s;urrender for want of provi&s;ions, or to fight with di&s;advantage before all their troops were a&s;&s;embled. But he had not the abi|lities, nor his troops the patience and di&s;cipline nece&s;|&s;ary for the execution of &s;uch a &s;cheme. The Cond&egrave; de Haro found little difficulty in conducting a con&s;ider|able reinforcement through all his po&s;ts into the town&punc; and Giron de&s;pairing of being able to reduce it, ad|vanced &s;uddenly to Villa-panda, a place belonging to the con&s;table, in which the enemy had their chief ma|gazine of provi&s;ions. By this ill-judged motion, he left Torde&s;illas open to the royali&s;ts, whom the Cond&egrave; de Haro led thither in the night, with the utmo&s;t &s;ecrecy and di&s;patch; and attacking the town, in which Giron had left no other garri&s;on than a regiment of prie&s;ts rai&s;ed by the bi&s;hop of Zamora, he, by break of day forced his way into it after a de&s;perate re&s;i&s;tance, be|came ma&s;ter of the Queen's per&s;on, took pri&s;oners ma|ny members of the Junta, and recovered the great &s;eal, with the other en&s;igns of government.</P>
<P>BY this fatal blow, the Junta lo&s;t all the reputation and authority which they derived from &s;eeming to act by the Queen's commands; &s;uch of the nobles as had hitherto been wavering or undetermined in their choice, now joined the regents with all their forces; and an uni|ver&s;al con&s;ternation &s;eized the partizans of the commons. This was much increa&s;ed by the &s;u&s;picions they began to entertain of Giron, whom they loudly accu&s;ed of having betrayed Torde&s;illas to the enemy; and though that charge &s;eems to have been de&s;titute of foundation, the &s;ucce&s;s of the royali&s;ts being owing to Giron's ill-conduct rather than to his treachery, he &s;o entirely lo&s;t credit with his party, that he re&s;igned his commi&s;&s;ion, and retired to one of his ca&s;tles <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Mi&s;cellaneous Tracts by Dr. Mich.

Their army, which grew &s;tronger every day by the arrival of troops from different parts of the kingdom, marched likewi&s;e to Valladolid; and Padilla being appointed commander in chief, the &s;pirits of the &s;oldiery revived, and the whole party forgetting the late misfortune, continued to expre&s;s the &s;ame ar|dent zeal for the liberties of their country, and the &s;ame implacable animo&s;ity again&s;t their oppre&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>WHAT they &s;tood mo&s;t in need of, was money to pay their troops. A great part of the current coin had been carried out of the kingdom by the Flemings; the &s;tated taxes levied in times of peace were incon&s;iderable; commerce of every kind being interrupted by the war, the &s;um which they yielded decrea&s;ed daily; and the Junta were afraid of di&s;gu&s;ting the people by burdening them with new impo&s;itions, to which, in that age, they were little accu&s;tomed. But from this difficulty they were extricated by Donna Maria Pacheco, Padilla's wife, a woman of noble birth, of great abilities, of boundle&s;s ambition, and animated with the mo&s;t ardent zeal in &s;upport of the cau&s;e of the Junta. She, with a boldne&s;s &s;uperior to tho&s;e &s;uper&s;titious fears which often influence her &s;ex, propo&s;ed to &s;eize all the rich and mag|nificent ornaments in the cathedral of Toledo; but le&s;t that action, by its appearance of impiety, might offend the people, &s;he and her retinue marched to the church in &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion, in mourning habits, with tears in their eyes, and beating their brea&s;ts, and falling on their knees, implored the pardon of the &s;aints who&s;e &s;hrines &s;he was about to violate.

<P>THE nobility di&s;covered great unwillingne&s;s to pro|ceed to extremities with the Junta. They were animat|ed with no le&s;s hatred than the commons again&s;t the Flemings; they approved much of &s;everal articles in the remon&s;trance; they thought the juncture favourable, not only for redre&s;&s;ing pa&s;t grievances, but for render|ing the con&s;titution more perfect and &s;ecure by new re|gulations; they were afraid that while the two orders of which the legi&s;lature was compo&s;ed, wa&s;ted each other's &s;trength by mutual ho&s;tilities, the crown would ri&s;e to power on the ruin or weakne&s;s of both, and encroach no le&s;s on the independence of the nobles, than on the pri|vileges of the commons. To this di&s;po&s;ition were ow|ing the frequent overtures of peace which the regents made to the Junta, and the continual negociations they carried on during the progre&s;s of their military opera|tions. Nor were the terms which they offered unrea|&s;onable; for, on condition that the Junta would pa&s;s from a few articles mo&s;t &s;ubver&s;ive of the royal authori|ty, or incon&s;i&s;tent with the rights of the nobility, they engaged to procure the Emperor's con&s;ent to their other demands, which, if he, through the influence of evil coun&s;ellors, &s;hould refu&s;e, &s;everal of the nobles pro|mi&s;ed to join with them in order to extort it <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">P.

Several of the cities which had entered into the confederacy, were filled with that mean jealou&s;y and di&s;tru&s;t of each other, which rival&s;hip in commerce or in grandeur is apt to in&s;pire; the con&s;table, by his influence and promi&s;es, had prevailed on the in|habitants of Burgos to abandon the Junta, and other

noblemen had &s;haken the fidelity of &s;ome of the le&s;&s;er cities; no per&s;on had ari&s;en among the commons of &s;uch &s;uperior abilities or elevation of mind, as to ac|quire the direction of their affairs; Padilla, their gene|ral, was a man of popular qualities, but di&s;tru&s;ted for that rea&s;on by tho&s;e or highe&s;t rank who adhered to the Junta; the conduct of Giron led the people to view with &s;u&s;picion every per&s;on of noble birth who joined their party; &s;o that the &s;tronge&s;t marks of irre&s;olution, mu|tual di&s;tru&s;t, and mediocrity of genius, appeared in all their proceedings at this time. After many con&s;ulta|tions held concerning the terms propo&s;ed by the re|gents, they &s;uffered them&s;elves to be &s;o carried away by re&s;entment again&s;t the nobility, that, rejecting all thoughts of accommodation, they threatened to &s;trip them of the crown-lands, which they or their ance&s;tors had u&s;urped, and to re-annex them to the royal domain: And on this prepo&s;terous &s;cheme, which would at once have annihilated all the liberties for which they had been &s;truggling, by rendering the Kings of Ca&s;tile ab|&s;olute and independent on their people, they were &s;o intent that they exclaimed with le&s;s vehemence again&s;t the exactions of the foreign mini&s;ters, than again&s;t the immen&s;e power and wealth of the nobles, and &s;eemed to hope that they might make peace with Charles, by offering to enrich him with their &s;poils.</P>
<P>THE &s;ucce&s;s which Padilla had met with in &s;everal &s;mall encounters, and in reducing &s;ome incon&s;iderable towns, helped to precipitate them into this mea&s;ure, filling them with &s;uch confidence in the valour of their troops, that they hoped for an ea&s;y victory over the roy|ali&s;ts. Padilla, that his army might not remain inactive, while flu&s;hed with good fortune, laid &s;iege to Torrelo|baton, a place of greater &s;trength and importance than any he had hitherto attacked, and which was defended by a &s;ufficient garri&s;on; and though the be&s;ieged made a de&s;perate re&s;i&s;tance, and the admiral attempted to re|lieve them, he took the town by &s;torm, and gave it up to be plundered by his &s;oldiers. If he had marched in|&s;tantly with his victorious army to Torde&s;illas, the head quarters of the royali&s;ts, he could &s;carce have failed of making an effectual impre&s;&s;ion on their troops, &s;urprized

Incapable alike of carrying on war, or of making peace, they li&s;tened again to overtures of ac|commodation, and even agreed to a &s;hort &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms. This negociation terminated in nothing; but while it was carrying on, many of Padilla's &s;oldiers, un|acquainted with the re&s;traints of di&s;cipline, went off with the booty they had got at Torrelobaton; and others, wearied out by the unu&s;ual length of the cam|paign, de&s;erted<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Sandov. 336.</NOTE>. The con&s;table too had lei&s;ure to a&s;|&s;emble his forces at Burgos, and to prepare every thing for marching, and as &s;oon as the truce expired, he ef|fected a junction with the Cond&egrave; de Haro, in &s;pite of all Padilla's efforts to prevent it. They advanced imme|diately towards Torrelobaton, and Padilla finding the number of his troops &s;o dimini&s;hed that he dur&s;t not ri&s;k a battle, attempted to retreat to Toro, which if be could have accompli&s;hed, the inva&s;ion of Navarre at that juncture by the French, and the nece&s;&s;ity which the regents mu&s;t have been under of detaching men to that kingdom, might have &s;aved him from danger. But Haro, &s;en&s;ible how fatal the con&s;equences would be of &s;uffering him to e&s;cape, marched with &s;uch rapidity at the head of his cavalry, that he came up with him near Villalar, and without waiting for his infantry, advanced to the attack. Padilla's army, fatigued and di&s;hearten|ed by their precipitate retreat, which they could not di&s;tingui&s;h from a flight, happened at that time to be pa&s;&s;ing over a ploughed field, on which &s;uch a violent rain had fallen, that the &s;oldiers &s;unk almo&s;t to the knees at every &s;tep, and remained expo&s;ed to the fire of &s;ome field-pieces which the rovali&s;ts had brought along with them. All the&s;e circum&s;tances &s;o di&s;concerted and in|timidated raw &s;oldiers, that without facing the enemy, or making any re&s;i&s;tance, they fled in the utmo&s;t con|fu&s;ion. Padilla exerted him&s;elf with extraordinary cou|rage and activity in order to rally them, though in vain; fear rendering them deaf both to his threats and intrea|ties: Upon which, finding matters irretrievable, and

<P>THE re&s;entment of his enemies did not &s;uffer Padilla to linger long in expectation of what &s;hould befall him.

<P>"To thee, the crown of Spain, and light of the whole world, free from the time of the mighty Goths; to thee, who by &s;hedding the blood of &s;trangers, as well as thy own blood, ha&s;t recovered liberty for thy&s;elf, and thy neighbouring cities. Thy legitimate &s;on Juan de Padilla gives information, how by the blood of his body, thy ancient victories are to be refre&s;hed. If fate hath not permitted my actions to be placed among your &s;ucce&s;sful and celebrated exploits, the fault hath been in my ill-fortune, not in my good-will. This I reque&s;t of thee as of a mother, to accept, &s;ince God hath given me nothing more to lo&s;e for thy &s;ake, than that which I am now to relinqui&s;h. I am more &s;olicitous about thy good opinion than about my own life. The &s;hiftings of fortune which never &s;tand &s;till, are many. But this I &s;ee with infinite con&s;ola|tion, that I, the lea&s;t of thy children, &s;uffer death for thee; and that thou ha&s;t nur&s;ed at thy brea&s;ts &s;uch as may take vengeance for my wrongs. Many tongues will relate the manner of my death, of which I am &s;till ignorant, though I know it to be near. My end will te&s;tify what was my de&s;ire. My &s;oul I recommend to thee as to the patrone&s;s of Chri&s;tianity. Of my body I &s;ay nothing, for it is not mine. I can write nothing more, for at this very moment, I feel the knife at my throat with greater dread of thy di&s;plea&s;ure, than apprehen&s;ion of my own pain." Sandov. Hi&s;t. vol. i. p. 478.</P>

After this, he &s;ubmitted quietly to his fate. Mo&s;t of the Spani&s;h hi&s;torians, accu&s;tomed to ideas of govern|ment, and of regal power very different from tho&s;e upon which he acted, have been &s;o eager to te&s;tify their di&s;|approbation of the cau&s;e in which he was engaged, that they have neglected, or have been afraid to do ju&s;tice to his virtues; and by blackening his memory, have endeavoured to deprive him of that pity, which is &s;el|dom denied to illu&s;trious &s;ufferers.</P>

a confederacy, formed not upon &s;light di&s;gu&s;ts or upon trifling motives, into which the whole body of the peo|ple had entered, and which had been allowed time to ac|quire &s;ome degree of order and con&s;i&s;tence by e&s;tabli&s;h|ing a regular plan of government, is the &s;tronge&s;t proof of the inability of its leaders, or of &s;ome &s;ecret di&s;cord reigning among the members. Though part of the ar|my by which they had been &s;ubdued, was obliged, a few days after the battle, to march towards Navarre, in order to check the progre&s;s of the French in that king|dom, nothing could prevail on the dejected commons of Ca&s;tile to take arms again, and to embrace &s;uch a fa|vourable opportunity of acquiring tho&s;e rights and pri|vileges for which they had appeared &s;o zealous. The city of Toledo alone, animated by Donna Maria Pa|checo, Padilla's widow, who, in&s;tead of bewailing her hu&s;band with a womani&s;h &s;orrow, prepared to revenge his death, and to pro&s;ecute that cau&s;e in defence of which he had &s;uffered, mu&s;t be excepted. Re&s;pect for her &s;ex, or admiration of her courage and abilities, as well as &s;ympathy with her misfortunes, and veneration for the memory of her hu&s;band, &s;ecured her the &s;ame a&s;cendant over the people which he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. The prudence and vigour with which &s;he acted, ju&s;tified the confidence they placed in her. She wrote to the French general in Navarre, encouraging him to invade Ca&s;tile by the offer of powerful a&s;&s;i&s;tance. She endeavoured by her letters and emi&s;&s;aries to revive the &s;pirit and hopes of other cities. She rai&s;ed &s;oldiers, and exacted a great &s;um from the clergy belonging to the cathedral to de|fray the expence of keeping them on foot<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">P. Mart. Ep. 727.</NOTE>. She em|ployed every artifice that could intere&s;t or inflame the populace. For this purpo&s;e &s;he ordered crucifixes to be u&s;ed by her troops in&s;tead of colours, as if they had been at war with Infidels, and enemies of religion; &s;he marched through the &s;treets of Toledo with her &s;on, a young child, clad in deep mourning, &s;eated on a mule, having a &s;tandard carried before him repre&s;enting the manner of his father's execution <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Sandov. 375.</NOTE>. By all the&s;e means &s;he kept the minds of the people in &s;uch perpetual agi|tation as prevented their pa&s;&s;ions from &s;ub&s;iding, and

rendered them in&s;en&s;ible of the dangers to which they were expo&s;ed by &s;tanding alone in oppo&s;ition to the royal authority. While the army was employed in Navarre, the regents were unable to attempt the reduction of Toledo by force; and all their endeavours either to di|mini&s;h Donna Maria's credit with the people, or to gain her by large promi&s;es, and the &s;olicitations of her brother the Marquis de Mondeair, proved ineffectual. Upon the expul&s;ion of the French out of Navarre, part of the army returned into Ca&s;tile, and inve&s;ted Toledo. Even this made no impre&s;&s;ion on the intrepid and ob&s;ti|nate courage of Donna Maria. She defended the town with vigour, her troops beat the royali&s;ts in &s;everal &s;al|lies, and no progre&s;s was made towards reducing the place, till the clergy, whom &s;he had highly offended by invading their property, having received information of the death of William de Croy Archbi&s;hop of Toledo, who&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that &s;ee was their chief grievance, and that the Emperor had named a Ca&s;tilian to &s;ucceed him, began to turn again&s;t her. They per&s;uaded the people that &s;he had acquired &s;uch influence over them by the force of enchantments, that &s;he was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a familiar demon which attended her in the form of a negro-maid, and that by its &s;ugge&s;tions &s;he regulated every part of her conduct <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">P.

The credulous multitude, whom their impatience of a long blockade, and de&s;pair of obtaining &s;uccours either from the cities formerly in confederacy with them, or from the French, rendered de&s;irous of peace, took arms again&s;t her, and driving her out of the city &s;urrendered it to the royali&s;ts. She retired to the citadel, which &s;he defended with amazing fortitude four months longer; and when reduced to the la&s;t extremities, &s;he made her e&s;cape in di&s;gui&s;e, and fled to Portugal, where &s;he had many relations <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sandov. 375.

The privileges which the cities had enjoyed were gradually circum|&s;cribed or aboli&s;hed; their commerce began from this period to decline; and becoming le&s;s wealthy and le&s;s populous, they lo&s;t that power and influence which they had acquired in the Cortes.</P>
<P>WHILE Ca&s;tile was expo&s;ed to the calamities of civil war, the kingdom of Valencia was torn by inte&s;tine commotions &s;till more violent. The a&s;&s;ociation which had been formed in the city of Valencia in the year one thou&s;and five hundred and twenty, and which was di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the name of the Germanada, continued to &s;ub&s;i&s;t after the Emperor's departure from Spain; and the members of it, upon pretext of defending the coa&s;ts again&s;t the de&s;cents of the Cor&s;airs of Barbary, and under &s;anction of that permi&s;&s;ion, which Charles had ra&s;hly granted them, refu&s;ed to lay down their arms. But as the grievances which the Valencians aimed at redre&s;&s;ing, proceeded from the arrogance and exactions of the no|bility, rather than from any unwarrantable exerci&s;e of the royal prerogative, their re&s;entment turned chiefly again&s;t the former. As &s;oon as they were allowed the u&s;e of arms, and became con&s;cious of their own &s;trength, they grew impatient to take vengeance of their oppre&s;|&s;ors. They drove the nobles out of mo&s;t of the cities, plundered their hou&s;es, wa&s;ted their lands, and a&s;&s;aulted their ca&s;tles. They then proceeded to elect thirteen per&s;ons, one from each company of trade&s;men e&s;tabli&s;h|ed in Valencia, and committed the admini&s;tration of government to them, under pretext that they would re|form the laws, e&s;tabli&s;h one uniform mode of di&s;pen&s;|ing ju&s;tice without partiality, or regard to the di&s;tinction of ranks, and thus re&s;tore men to &s;ome degree of their original equality.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="011837_0534_0F9D884B70F52848">THE nobles were obliged to take arms in &s;elf-defence. Ho&s;tilities began, and were carried on with all the ran|cour, with which re&s;entment at oppre&s;&s;ion in&s;pired the one party, and the idea of in&s;ulting dignity animated the other. As no per&s;on of honourable birth, or of liberal education joined the Germanada, the councils as well as troops of the confederacy were conducted by low me|chanics, who acquired the confidence of an enraged mul|titude chiefly by the fiercene&s;s of their zeal, and the ex|travagance of their proceedings. Among &s;uch men, the laws introduced in civilized nations, in order to re|&s;train or moderate the violence of war, were unknown or de&s;pi&s;ed; and they committed the wilde&s;t acts of cruelty and outrage.</P>
<P>THE Emperor occupied with &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the in&s;ur|rection in Ca&s;tile, which more immediately threatened the &s;ubver&s;ion of his power and prerogative, was unable to give much attention to the tumults in Valencia, and left the nobility of that kingdom to fight their own battles. His viceroy, the Cond&egrave; de Melito, had the &s;upreme command of the forces which the nobles rai&s;ed among their va&s;&s;als. The Germanada carried on the war during the years 1520 and 1521, with a more per|&s;evering courage, than could have been expected from a body &s;o tumultuary, under the conduct of &s;uch leaders. They defeated the nobility in &s;everal actions, which, though not con&s;iderable, were extremely &s;harp. They repul&s;ed them in their attempts to reduce different towns. But the nobles, by their &s;uperior &s;kill in war, and at the head of troops more accu&s;tomed to &s;ervice, gained the advantage in mo&s;t of the rencounters. At length, they were joined by a body of Ca&s;tilian cavalry, which the regents di&s;patched towards Valencia, &s;oon after their victory over Padilla at Villalar, and by their a&s;&s;i&s;tance they acquired &s;uch &s;uperiority, that they en|tirely broke and ruined the Germanada. The leaders of the party were put to death, almo&s;t without any for|mality of legal trial, and &s;uffered &s;uch cruel puni&s;hments, as the &s;en&s;e of recent injuries prompted the nobles to inflict. The government of Valencia was re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in its ancient form <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Argen&s;ola Anales de Aragon, cap. 75. 90. 99. 118. Sayas Anales de Aragon, cap. 5. 12, &amp;c. P. Mart.

But in the i&s;land of Majorca, which was annexed to the crown of Aragon, the &s;ame cau&s;es that had excited the commotions in Valencia, produced effects no le&s;s violent.

The ob&s;tinacy with which the people of Majorca per&s;i&s;ted in their rebellion, was equal to the rage with which they began it.

<P>WHILE the &s;pirit of di&s;affection was &s;o general among the Spaniards, and &s;o many cau&s;es concurred in preci|pitating them into &s;uch violent mea&s;ures, in order to ob|tain the redre&s;s of their grievances, it may appear &s;trange, that the malecontents in the different kingdoms &s;hould have carried on their operations without any mu|tual concert, or even any intercour&s;e with each other. By uniting their councils and arms, they might have acted both with greater force, and with more effect. The appearance of a national confederacy would have rendered it no le&s;s re&s;pectable among the people, than formidable to the crown; and the Emperor, unable to re&s;i&s;t &s;uch a combination, mu&s;t have complied with any terms which the members of it thought fit to pre&s;cribe. Many things, however, prevented the Spaniards from forming them&s;elves into one body, and pur&s;uing com|mon mea&s;ures. The people of the different kingdoms in Spain, though they were become the &s;ubjects of the &s;ame Sovereign, retained, in full force, their national an|tipathy
<PB N="128" REF="011837_0536_0F9D884CF09F9DD8">
to each other. The remembrance of their an|cient rival&s;hip and ho&s;tilities was &s;till recent, and the &s;en&s;e of reciprocal injuries &s;o intire, as to be incompa|tible with their acting with confidence and concert. Each nation cho&s;e rather to depend on its own efforts, and to maintain the &s;truggle alone, than to implore the aid of neighbours, whom they di&s;tru&s;ted and hated. At the &s;ame time, the forms of government in the &s;everal kingdoms of Spain were &s;o different, and the grievances of which they complained, as well as the alterations and amendments which they attempted to introduce, &s;o va|rious, that it was not ea&s;y to bring them to unite in any common plan. To this di&s;union Charles was indebted for the pre&s;ervation of his Spani&s;h crowns; and while each of the kingdoms followed &s;eparate mea&s;ures, all of them were obliged at la&s;t to conform to the will of their Sovereign.</P>
<P>THE arrival of the Emperor in Spain filled his &s;ubjects who had been in arms again&s;t him with deep apprehen|&s;ions; from which he &s;oon delivered them by an act of clemency, no le&s;s prudent than generous. After a re|bellion &s;o general, &s;carce twenty per&s;ons, among &s;o many criminals obnoxious to the law, had been puni&s;hed capi|tally in Ca&s;tile. Though &s;trongly &s;ollicited by his council, Charles refu&s;ed to &s;hed any more blood by the hands of the executioner; and publi&s;hed a general par|don, extending to all crimes committed &s;ince the com|mencement of the in&s;urrections, from which only four|&s;core were excepted. Even the&s;e he &s;eems to have named, rather with an intention to intimidate others, than from any inclination to &s;eize them; for when an officious courtier offered to inform him where one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable among them was concealed, he avoid|ed it by a good-natured plea&s;antry; "Go," &s;ays he, "I have now no rea&s;on to be afraid of that man, but he has &s;ome cau&s;e to keep at a di&s;tance from me, and you would be better employed in telling him that I am here, than in acquainting me with the place of his re|treat <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Sandov. 377, &amp;c.

<P>ADRIAN, though devoted to the Emperor, endea|voured to a&s;&s;ume the impartiality which became the common father of Chri&s;tendom, and laboured to recon|cile the contending Princes, that they might unite in a league again&s;t Solyman, who&s;e conque&s;t of Rhodes rendered him more formidable than ever to Europe <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Bellefor.

To examine &s;uch a variety of preten&s;ions, to adju&s;t &s;uch a number of interfering intere&s;ts, to extingui&s;h the pa&s;|&s;ions which ambition, emulation, and mutual injuries had kindled, to bring &s;o many ho&s;tile powers to pur&s;ue the &s;ame &s;cheme with unanimity and vigour, required not only uprightne&s;s of intentions, but a great &s;uperio|rity both of under&s;tanding and addre&s;s.</P>
<P>THE Italian &s;tates were no le&s;s de&s;irous of peace than the Pope. The Imperial army under Colonna was &s;till kept on foot, but as the Emperor's revenues in Spain, in Naples, and in the Low-Countries, were either exhau&s;ted, or applied to &s;ome other purpo&s;e, it de|pended entirely for pay and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence on the Italians. A great part of it was quartered in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate, and monthly contributions were levied upon the Florentines, the Milane&s;e, the Genoe&s;e, and Lucche&s;e, by the viceroy of Naples; and though all exclaimed again&s;t &s;uch oppre&s;&s;ion, and were impatient to be de|livered from it, the dread of wor&s;e con&s;equences from the rage of the army, or the re&s;entment of the Emperor, obliged them to &s;ubmit<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Guic. l. 15. 238.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SO much regard, however, was paid to the Pope's exhortations, and to a bull which he i&s;&s;ued requiring all Chri&s;tian Princes to con&s;ent to a truce for three years, that the Imperial, the French, and the Engli&s;h Amba&s;|&s;adors at Rome were impowered to treat of that matter;

but while they wa&s;ted their time in fruitle&s;s negocia|tions, their ma&s;ters continued their preparations for war. The Venetians, who had hitherto adhered with great firmne&s;s to their alliance with Francis, being now con|vinced that his affairs in Italy were in a de&s;perate &s;itua|tion, entered into a league again&s;t him with the Emperor; to which Adrian, at the in&s;tigation of his countryman and friend Charles de Lannoy, viceroy of Naples, who per&s;uaded him that the only ob&s;tacles to peace aro&s;e from the ambition of the French King, &s;oon after ac|ceded. The other Italian &s;tates followed their example; and Francis was left without a &s;ingle ally to re&s;i&s;t the efforts of &s;o many enemies who&s;e armies threatened, and who&s;e territories encompa&s;&s;ed his dominions on every &s;ide <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Guic. l. 15, 2, 1, 248.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE dread of this powerful confederacy, it was thought, would have obliged Francis to keep wholly on the defen&s;ive, or at lea&s;t have prevented his entertaining any thoughts of marching into Italy. But it was the character of that Prince, too apt to become remi&s;s, and even negligent on ordinary occa&s;ions, to rouze at the approach of danger, and not only to encounter it with &s;pirit and intrepidity, qualities which never for&s;ook him, but to provide again&s;t it with diligence and indu&s;try. Before his enemies were ready to execute any of their &s;chemes, Francis had a&s;&s;embled a numerous army. His authority over his own &s;ubjects was far greater than that which Charles or Henry po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed over theirs. They depended on their parliaments for money, which was u&s;ually granted them in &s;mall &s;ums, very &s;lowly, and with much reluctance. The taxes he could impo&s;e were more con&s;iderable, and levied with greater di&s;|patch; &s;o that on this, as well as on other occa&s;ions, his army was in the field while they were devi&s;ing ways and means for rai&s;ing theirs. Sen&s;ible of this advan|tage, Francis hoped to di&s;concert all the Emperor's &s;chemes, by marching in per&s;on into the Milane&s;e; and this bold mea&s;ure, the more formidable, becau&s;e un|expected, could &s;carce have failed of producing that ef|fect. The vanguard of his army had already reached

Lyons, and he him&s;elf was ha&s;tening after it with the &s;econd divi&s;ion of his troops, when the di&s;covery of a dome&s;tic con&s;piracy which threatened the ruin of the kingdom, obliged him to &s;top &s;hort, and to alter his mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>THE author of this dangerous plot was Charles duke of Bourbon, Lord High Con&s;table, who&s;e noble birth, va&s;t fortune, and high office, rai&s;ed him to be the mo&s;t powerful &s;ubject in France, as his great talents, equal|ly &s;uited to the field or the council, and his &s;ignal &s;er|vices to the crown rendered him the mo&s;t illu&s;trious and de&s;erving. The near re&s;emblance between the King and him in many of their qualities, both being fond of war, and ambitious to excel in active and manly exerci&s;es, as well as their equality in age, and their proximity of blood, ought naturally to have &s;ecured him a con&s;ider|able &s;hare in that monarch's favour. But unhappily Loui&s;e, the King's mother, had contracted a violent aver&s;ion to the hou&s;e of Bourbon, for no better rea&s;on than becau&s;e Anne of Bretagne, the Queen of Lewis the Twelfth, with whom &s;he lived in perpetual enmity, di&s;covered a peculiar attachment to that branch of the royal family; and &s;he had taught her &s;on, who was too &s;u&s;ceptible of any impre&s;&s;ion &s;he gave him, to view all the con&s;table's actions with a mean and unbecoming jealou&s;y. His di&s;tingui&s;hed merit at the battle of Ma|rignano had not been &s;ufficiently rewarded; he had been recalled from the government of Milan upon very frivo|lous pretences, and had met with a cold reception, which his prudent conduct in that difficult &s;tation did not de&s;erve; the payment of his pen&s;ions had been &s;u&s;|pended without any good cau&s;e; and during the cam|paign of one thou&s;and five hundred and twenty-one, the King, as has already been related, had affronted him in the pre&s;ence of the whole army, by giving the command of the van to the Duke of Alencon. The con&s;table, at fir&s;t, bore the&s;e indignities with greater moderation than could have been expected from an high-&s;pirited Prince, con&s;cious of what was due to his rank, and to his &s;ervices. Such a multiplicity of inju|ries, however, exhau&s;ted his patience; and in&s;piring him with thoughts of revenge, he retired from court,
<PB N="133" REF="011837_0541_0F9D8850B0628538">
and began to hold a &s;ecret corre&s;pondence with &s;ome of the Emperor's mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>ABOUT that time the Dutche&s;s of Bourbon happened to die without leaving any children; and Loui&s;e, of a di&s;po&s;ition no le&s;s amorous than vindictive, and &s;till &s;u&s;ceptible of the tender pa&s;&s;ions at the age of forty-&s;ix, began to view the con&s;table, a Prince as amiable as he was accompli&s;hed, with other eyes; and notwith&s;tand|ing the great di&s;parity of their years, &s;he formed the &s;cheme of marrying him. Bourbon, who might have ex|pected every thing to which an ambitious mind can a&s;|pire, from the doting fondne&s;s of a woman who go|verned her &s;on and the kingdom, being incapable either of imitating the Queen in her &s;udden tran&s;ition from hatred to love, or of di&s;&s;embling &s;o meanly as to pre|tend affection for one who had pro&s;ecuted him &s;o long with unprovoked malice, not only rejected the match, but embittered his refu&s;al by &s;ome &s;evere rai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lery on Loui&s;e's per&s;on and character. She finding her&s;elf not only contemned, but in&s;ulted, her di&s;appointed love turned into hatred, and &s;ince &s;he could not marry, &s;he re&s;olved to ruin Bourbon.</P>
<P>FOR this purpo&s;e &s;he con&s;ulted with the Chancellor du Prat, a man, who by a ba&s;e pro&s;titution of great talents, and of &s;uperior &s;kill in his profe&s;&s;ion, had ri&s;en to that high office. By his advice a law &s;uit was com|menced again&s;t the con&s;table, for the whole e&s;tate be|longing to the hou&s;e of Bourbon. Part of it was claim|ed in the King's name, as having fallen to the crown; part in that of Loui&s;e, as the neare&s;t heir in blood of the decea&s;ed Dutche&s;s. Both the&s;e claims were equally de&s;titute of any foundation in ju&s;tice; but Loui&s;e, by her &s;olicitations and authority, and Du Prat by employ|ing all the artifices and chicanery of law, prevailed on the judges to order the e&s;tate to be &s;equ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tred. This unju&s;t deci&s;ion drove the con&s;table to de&s;pair, and to mea&s;ures which de&s;pair alone could have dictated. He renewed his intrigues in the Imperial court, and flat|tering him&s;elf that the injuries he had &s;uffered would ju&s;tify his having recour&s;e to any means in order to ob|tain revenge, he offered to transfer his allegiance from his natural Sovereign to the Emperor, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t him

The Emperor offered him in marriage his &s;i&s;ter Eleanor, the widow of the King of Portugal, with a va&s;t portion. He was in|cluded as a principal in the treaty between Charles and Henry. The counties of Provence and Dauphin&egrave; were to be &s;ettled on him, with the title of King. The Em|peror engaged to enter France by the Pyrenees, and Henry, &s;upported by the Flemings, to invade Picardy; while twelve thou&s;and Germans, levied at their com|mon charge, were to penetrate into Burgundy, and to act in concert with Bourbon, who undertook to rai&s;e &s;ix thou&s;and men among his friends and va&s;&s;als in the heart of the kingdom. The execution of this deep-laid and dangerous plot was &s;u&s;pended, until the King &s;hould cro&s;s the Alps with the only army capable of defending his dominions; and as he was far advanced in his march for that purpo&s;e, France &s;tood on the brink of de|&s;truction <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">huani Hi&s;t. lib. i. c. 10.

<P>HAPPILY for that kingdom, a negociation which had now been carrying on for &s;everal months, though conducted with the mo&s;t profound &s;ecrecy and commu|nicated only to a few cho&s;en confidents, could not alto|gether e&s;cape the ob&s;ervation of the re&s;t of the con|&s;table's numerous retainers, rendered more inqui&s;itive by finding that they were di&s;tru&s;ted. Two of the&s;e gave the King &s;ome intimation of a my&s;terious corre|&s;pondence between their ma&s;ter and the Comte de Ro|eux, a Flemi&s;h nobleman of great confidence with the Emperor. Francis, who could not bring him&s;elf to &s;u&s;|pect that the fir&s;t Prince of the blood would be &s;o ba&s;e as to betray the kingdom to its enemies, immediately repaired to Moulins, where the con&s;table was in bed, feigning indi&s;po&s;ition, that he might not be obliged to accompany the King into Italy, and acquainted him of

the intelligence which he had received. Bourbon, with great &s;olemnity and the mo&s;t impo&s;ing affectation of in|genuity and candour, a&s;&s;erted his own innocence; and as his health, he &s;aid, was now more confirmed, he pro|mi&s;ed to join the army within a few days. Francis, open and candid him&s;elf, and too apt to be deceived by the appearance of tho&s;e virtues in others, gave &s;uch cre|dit to what he &s;aid, that he refu&s;ed to arre&s;t him, al|though advi&s;ed to take that precaution by his wi&s;e&s;t coun&s;ellors, and as if the danger had been over, he con|tinued his march towards Lyons. The con&s;table &s;et out &s;oon after, &s;eemingly with an intention to follow him; but turning &s;uddenly to the left, he cro&s;&s;ed the Rhone, and after infinite fatigues and perils e&s;caped all the parties which the King, &s;en&s;ible too late of his cre|dulity, &s;ent out to intercept him, and reached Italy in &s;afety<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Bellay, p. 64, &amp;c. Pa&s;quier Recherches de la France, p. 481.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FRANCIS took every po&s;&s;ible precaution to prevent the bad effects of the irreparable error he had commit|ted. He put garri&s;ons in all places of &s;trength in the con&s;table's territories. He &s;eized all the gentlemen whom he could &s;u&s;pect of being his a&s;&s;ociates, and as he had not hitherto di&s;covered the whole extent of the con|&s;pirator's &s;chemes, nor knew how far the infection had &s;pread among his &s;ubjects, he was afraid that his ab&s;ence might encourage them to make &s;ome de&s;perate attempt, and for that rea&s;on relinqui&s;hed his intention of leading his army in per&s;on into Italy.</P>
<P>HE did not, however, abandon his de&s;ign on the Mi|lane&s;e; but appointed admiral Bonnivet to take the &s;u|preme command in his &s;tead, and to march into that country with an army 30,000 &s;trong. Bonnivet did not owe this preferment to his abilities as a general; for of all talents requi&s;ite to form a great commander, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed only per&s;onal courage, the lowe&s;t and the mo&s;t common. But he was the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed gentle|man in the French court, of agreeable manners, an in&s;i|nuating addre&s;s, and a &s;prightly conver&s;ation; and Fran|cis, who lived in great familiarity with his courtiers, was &s;o charmed with the&s;e qualities, that he honoured him

on all occa&s;ions, with the mo&s;t partial and di&s;tingui&s;hing marks of his favour. He was, be&s;ides, the implacable enemy of Bourbon; and as the King &s;carce knew whom to tru&s;t at that juncture, he thought the chief command could be lodged no where &s;o &s;afely as in his hands.</P>
<P>COLONNA, who was entru&s;ted with the defence of the Milane&s;e, his own conque&s;t, was in no condition to re|&s;i&s;t &s;uch a formidable army. He had &s;carce money &s;ufficient to pay his troops, reduced to a &s;mall number by &s;ickne&s;s or de&s;ertion, and had, for that rea&s;on, been obliged to neglect every precaution nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;e|curity of the country. The only plan he formed, was to defend the pa&s;&s;age of the river Te&s;ino again&s;t the French; and, as if he had forgotten how ea&s;ily he him|&s;elf had di&s;concerted a &s;imilar &s;cheme formed by Lau|trec, he promi&s;ed with great confidence on its being ef|fectual. But in &s;pite of all his caution, it &s;ucceeded no better with him than with Lautrec. Bonnivet pa&s;&s;ed the river without lo&s;s, at a ford which had been neglected, and the Imperiali&s;ts retired to Milan, preparing to aban|don the town as &s;oon as the French &s;hould appear be|fore it.

Bonnivet did not ad|vance for three or four days, and lo&s;t the opportunity with which his good fortune pre&s;ented him. The citi|zens recovered from their con&s;ternation: Colonna &s;till active, at the age of four&s;core, and Moron&egrave;, who&s;e en|mity to France was indefatigable, were employed night and day in repairing the fortifications, in ama&s;&s;ing pro|vi&s;ions, in collecting troops from every quarter, and by the time the French approached, had put the city in a condition to &s;tand a &s;iege. Bonnivet, after &s;ome fruitle&s;s attempts on the town, which hara&s;&s;ed his own troops more than the enemy, was obliged, by the inclemency of the &s;ea&s;on to retire into winter-quarters.</P>

The Cardinal de Medici in&s;tantly renewed his preten&s;ions to the Papal dignity, and entered the con|clave with high expectations on his own part, and a ge|neral opinion of the people that they would be &s;ucce&s;sful. But though &s;upported by the Imperial faction, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great per&s;onal intere&s;t, and capable of all the arti|fices, refinements, and corruptions, which reign in tho&s;e a&s;&s;emblies, the ob&s;tinacy and intrigues of his rivals pro|tracted the conclave to the unu&s;ual length of fifty days. The addre&s;s and per&s;everance of the Cardinal &s;urmount|ed at la&s;t every ob&s;tacle. He was rai&s;ed to the head of the church, and a&s;&s;umed the government of it by the name of Clement VII. The choice was univer&s;ally approved of. High expectations were conceived of a Pope, who&s;e great talents, and long experience in bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;eemed to qualify him no le&s;s for defending the &s;piritual intere&s;ts of the church, expo&s;ed to imminent danger by the pro|gre&s;s of Luther's opinions, than for conducting its poli|tical operations with the prudence requi&s;ite at &s;uch a dif|ficult juncture; and who, be&s;ides the&s;e advantages, ren|dered the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate more re&s;pectable, by hav|ing in his hands the government of Florence, and the wealth of the family of Medici <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Guic. lib. 15. 263.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CARDINAL WOLSEY, not di&s;heartened by the di&s;ap|pointment of his ambitious views at the former election, had entertained more &s;anguine hopes of &s;ucce&s;s on this occa&s;ion.

Wol&s;ey be&s;tirred him&s;elf with activity &s;uitable to the importance of the prize for which he contended, and in&s;tructed his agents at Rome to &s;pare neither pro|mi&s;es nor bribes in order to gain his end. But Charles had either amu&s;ed him with vain hopes, which he never intended to gratify, or he judged it impolitic to oppo&s;e a candidate who had &s;uch a pro&s;pect of &s;ucceeding as Medici; or perhaps the cardinals dur&s;t not venture to provoke the people of Rome, while their indignation again&s;t Adrian's memory was &s;till fre&s;h, by placing another Ultramontane in the papal throne.

after all his expectations and endeavours, had the morti|fication to &s;ee a Pope elected, of &s;uch an age, and of &s;o vig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, that he could not comfort him|&s;elf much with the chance of &s;urviving him. Wol&s;ey, by this &s;econd proof, was fully convinced of the Empe|ror's in&s;incerity, and it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">xcited in him all the re&s;entment which an haughty mind feels on being at once di&s;ap|pointed and deceived; and though Clement endea|voured to &s;ooth his vindictive nature by granting him a commi&s;&s;ion to be legate in England during life, with &s;uch ample powers as ve&s;ted in him almo&s;t the whole papal juri&s;diction in that kingdom, the injury he had re|ceived entirely di&s;&s;olved the tie which had united him to Charles, and from that moment he meditated revenge. It was nece&s;&s;ary, however, to conceal his intention from his ma&s;ter, and to &s;u&s;pend the execution of it, until by a dextrous improvement of the incidents which might oc|cur, he &s;hould be able gradually to alienate the King's affections from the Emperor. For this rea&s;on, he was &s;o far from expre&s;&s;ing any unea&s;ine&s;s on account of the repul&s;e he had met with, that he abounded on every oc|ca&s;ion, private as well as public, in declarations of his high &s;atisfaction with Clement's promotion <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Fiddes's life of Wol&s;ey, 294, &amp;c.

<P>HENRY had, during the campaign, fulfilled with great &s;incerity whatever he was bound to perform by the league again&s;t France, though more &s;lowly than he could have wi&s;hed.

The ex|pence which the&s;e alterations in the military &s;y&s;tem ne|ce&s;&s;arily created, appeared intolerable to nations hitherto unaccu&s;tomed to the burthen of heavy taxes. Hence pro|ceeded the frugal, and even par&s;imonious &s;pirit of the Engli&s;h parliaments in that age, which Henry, with all his authority, was &s;eldom able to overcome. The com|mons, having refu&s;ed at this time to grant him the &s;up|plies he demanded, he had recour&s;e to the ample and al|mo&s;t unlimited prerogative, which the Kings of Eng|land then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and by a violent and unu&s;ual ex|ertion of it, rai&s;ed the money he wanted. This, how|ever, wa&s;ted &s;o much time, that it was late in the &s;ea&s;on before his army, under the duke of Suffolk, could take the field. Being joined by a con&s;iderable body of Fle|mings, Suffolk marched into Picardy, and Francis from his extravagant eagerne&s;s to recover the Milane&s;e, hav|ing left that frontier almo&s;t unguarded, he penetrated as far as the banks of the river Oy&s;e, within eleven leagues of Paris, filling that capital with con&s;ternation. But the arrival of &s;ome troops detached by the King, who was &s;till at Lyons; the active gallantry of the French officers, who allowed the allies no re&s;pite night or day; the rigour of a mo&s;t unnatural &s;ea&s;on, together with &s;carcity of provi&s;ions, compelled Suffolk to retire; and La Tremo&uuml;ille, who commanded in tho&s;e parts, had the glory of having, with an handful of men, checked the progre&s;s of a formidable army, and of having driven them with ignominy out of the French territories <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Herbert.

<P>THE Emperor's attempts upon Burgundy and Gui|enne were not more fortunate, though in both the&s;e pro|vinces Francis was equally ill prepared to re&s;i&s;t them.

<P>THE en&s;uing year opened with events more di&s;a&s;trous to France. Fontarabia was lo&s;t by the cowardice or treachery of its governor.

But all his endeavours were ineffectual; a numerous army, to which each of the allies furni&s;hed their contingent of troops, was a&s;|&s;embled at Milan by the beginning of March. Lannoy, viceroy of Naples, took the command of it upon Co|lonna's death, though the chief direction of military ope|rations was committed to Bourbon, and the marquis de Pe&s;cara; the latter, the able&s;t and mo&s;t enterprizing of the Imperial generals; the former in&s;pired by his re|&s;entment with new activity and invention, and acquainted &s;o thoroughly with the characters of the French com|manders, the genius of their troops, and the &s;trength as well as weakne&s;s of their armies, as to be of infinite &s;er|vice to the party which he joined.

<P>BONNIVET was de&s;titute of troops to oppo&s;e this ar|my, and &s;till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ore of the talents that could render him an equal match for its leaders. After various move|ments and encounters, de&s;cribed with great accuracy by the contemporary hi&s;torians, a detail of which, at this di&s;tance of time, would be equally unintere&s;ting and un|in&s;tructive, he was forced to abandon the &s;trong camp in which he had entrenched him&s;elf at Biagra&s;&s;a. Soon af|ter, partly by his own mi&s;conduct, partly by the activity of the enemy, who hara&s;&s;ed and ruined his army by con|tinual &s;kirmi&s;hes, while they carefully declined a battle which he often offered them, and partly by the caprice of 6000 Swi&s;s, who refu&s;ed to join his army, though with|in a day's march of it; he was reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of attempting a retreat into France through the valley of Ao&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> Ju&s;t as he arrived on the banks of the Se&s;&s;ia, and began to pa&s;s that river, Bourbon and Pe&s;cara ap|peared with the vanguard of the allies, and attacked his rear with great fury. At the beginning of the charge, Bonnivet, while exerting him&s;elf with much valour, was wounded &s;o dangerou&s;ly as obliged him to quit the field; and the conduct of the rear was committed to the che|valier Bayard, who, though &s;o much a &s;tranger to the arts of a court, that he never ro&s;e to the chief command, was always called, in times of real danger, to the po&s;ts of difficulty and importance. He put him&s;elf at the head of the men at arms, and animating them by his pre&s;ence and example to &s;u&s;tain the whole &s;hock of the enemy's troops, he gained time for the re&s;t of his countrymen to make good their retreat. But in this &s;ervice he receiv|ed a wound, which he immediately perceived to be mor|tal,

and being unable to continue any longer on hor&s;e|back, he ordered one of his attendants to place him un|der a tree, with his face towards the enemy; then fixing his eyes on the guard of his &s;word, which he held up in&s;tead of a cro&s;s, he addre&s;&s;ed his prayers to God, and in this po&s;ture, which became his character both as a &s;oldier and as a Chri&s;tian, he calmly waited the ap|proach of death. Bourbon, who led the foremo&s;t of the enemies troops, found him in this &s;ituation, and ex|pre&s;&s;ed regret and pity at the &s;ight. "Pity not me," cried the high-&s;pirited chevalier, "I die as a man of honour ought, in the di&s;charge of my duty: They in|deed are objects of pity, who fight again&s;t their King, their country, and their oath." The Marquis de Pe&s;cara, pa&s;&s;ing &s;oon after, manife&s;ted his admiration of Bayard's virtues, and his &s;orrow for his fall, with the genero&s;ity of a gallant enemy; and finding that he could not be removed with &s;afety from that &s;pot, ordered a tent to be pitched there, and appointed proper per&s;ons to at|tend him. He died, notwith&s;tanding their care, as his ance&s;tors for &s;everal generations had done, in the field of battle. Pe&s;cara ordered his body to be embalmed, and &s;ent to his relations; and &s;uch was the re&s;pect paid to military merit in that age, that the Duke of Savoy commanded it to be received with royal honours in all the cities of his dominions; in Dauphin&egrave;, Bayard's na|tive country, the people of all ranks came out in a &s;o|lemn proce&s;&s;ion to meet it <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Bellefor.

<P>BONNIVET led back the &s;hattered remains of his ar|my into France; and in one &s;hort campaign, Francis was &s;tripped of all he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in Italy, and left without one ally in that country.</P>
<P>WHILE the war kindled by the emulation of Charles and Francis &s;pread over &s;o many countries of Europe, Germany enjoyed a profound tranquillity, extremely fa|vourable to the reformation, which continued to make progre&s;s daily. During Luther's confinement in his retreat at Wartburg, Carlo&s;tadius, one of his di&s;ciples,

animated with the &s;ame zeal, but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of le&s;s pru|dence and moderation than his ma&s;ter, began to pro|pagate wild and dangerous opinions, chiefly among the lower people. Encouraged by his ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tions they ro&s;e in &s;everal villages of Saxony, broke into the churches with tumultuary violence, and threw down and de&s;troy|ed the images with which they were adorned. The&s;e irregular and outrageous proceedings were &s;o repug|nant to all the Elector's cautious maxims, that if they had not received a timely check, they could &s;carce have failed of alienating from the reformers that Prince, jea|lous to a great degree of his own authority, and afraid of giving offence to the Emperor, and other patrons of the antient opinions. Luther, &s;en&s;ible of the danger, immediately quitted his retreat, without waiting for Frederick's permi&s;&s;ion, and returned to Wittemberg. Happily for the reformation, the veneration for his per|&s;on and authority were &s;till &s;o great, that his appearance alone &s;uppre&s;&s;ed that &s;pirit of extravagance which began to &s;eize his party.

<P>BEFORE Luther left his retreat, he had begun to tran&s;late the Bible into the German tongue, an under|taking of no le&s;s difficulty than importance, of which he was extremely fond, and for which he was well quali|fied: He had a competent knowledge in the original languages; a thorough acquaintance with the &s;tyle and &s;entiments of the in&s;pired writers; and though his com|po&s;itions in Latin were rude and barbarous, he was rec|koned a great ma&s;ter of the purity of his mother-tongue, and could expre&s;s him&s;elf with all the elegance of which it is capable. By his own a&s;&s;iduous applica|tion, together with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Melancthon, and &s;everal other of his di&s;ciples, he fini&s;hed part of the New Te&s;tament this year; and the publication of it proved more fatal to the church of Rome, than that of all his own works. It was read with wonderful avidi|ty and attention by per&s;ons of every rank. They were a&s;toni&s;hed at di&s;covering how contrary the precepts of

The great advantage ari&s;ing from Luther's tran&s;lation of the Bible, encouraged the advocates for reformation, in the other countries of Europe, to imitate his example, and to publi&s;h ver&s;ions of the Scriptures in their re&s;pective languages.</P>
<P>ABOUT this time, Nuremberg, Franckfort, Ham|burgh, and &s;everal other cities in Germany of the fir&s;t rank openly embraced the reformed religion, and by the authority of their magi&s;trates aboli&s;hed the ma&s;s, and the other &s;uper&s;titious rites of Popery <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Seckend. 241. Chytraei Contin. Krantzii, 203.</NOTE>. The Elector of Brandenburgh, the Dukes of Brun&s;wick and Lunen|burgh, and Prince of Anhalt, became avowed patrons of Luther's opinions, and countenanced the preaching of them among their &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>THE court of Rome beheld this growing defection with great concern; and Adrian's fir&s;t care after his ar|rival in Italy, had been to deliberate with the cardinals, concerning the proper means of putting a &s;top to it. This Pope was profoundly &s;killed in &s;chola&s;tic theolo|gy, and having been early taken notice of on that ac|count, he &s;till retained &s;uch an exce&s;&s;ive admiration of the &s;cience to which he owed his reputation and &s;uc|ce&s;s in life, that he con&s;idered Luther's invectives again&s;t the &s;choolmen, particularly Thomas Aquinas, as little le&s;s than bla&s;phemy. All the tenets of that doctor appeared to him &s;o clear and irrefragable, that he &s;uppo&s;ed every per&s;on who called in que&s;tion or con|tradicted them, to be either blinded by ignorance, or to be acting in oppo&s;ition to the conviction of his own mind: Of cour&s;e, no Pope was ever more bigotted or inflexi|ble with regard to points of doctrine than Adrian; he not only maintained them as Leo had done, becau&s;e they were antient, or becau&s;e it was dangerous for the church to allow of innovations, but he adhered to them with

the zeal of a theologian, and with the tenaciou&s;ne&s;s of a di&s;putant. At the &s;ame time, his own manners being ex|tremely &s;imple, and uninfected with any of the vices which reigned in the court of Rome, he was as &s;en&s;ible of its corruptions as the reformers them&s;elves, and view|ed them with no le&s;s indignation. The brief he ad|dre&s;&s;ed to the Diet of the empire a&s;&s;embled at Nurem|berg, and the in&s;tructions he gave Cheregato the nun|cio whom he &s;ent thither, were framed agreeably to the&s;e views. On the one hand, he condemned Luther's opi|nions with more a&s;perity and rancour of expre&s;&s;ion than Leo had ever u&s;ed; he &s;everely cen&s;ured the Princes of Germany for &s;uffering him to &s;pread his pernicious te|nets, by their neglecting to execute the edict of the Diet at Worms, and required them, if Luther did not in&s;tantly retract his errors, to de&s;troy him with fire as a gangrened and incurable member, in like manner as Dathan and Abiram had been cut of by Mo&s;es, Anna|nias and Sapphira by the apo&s;tles, and John Hu&s;s and Jerome of Prague by their ance&s;tors <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Fa&s;cic.

On the other hand, he, with great candour, and in the mo&s;t expli|cit terms, acknowledged the corruptions of the Roman court to be the &s;ource from which had flowed all the evils that the church now felt or dreaded; he promi&s;ed to exert all his authority towards reforming the&s;e abu&s;es, with as much di&s;patch as the nature and inveteracy of the di&s;orders would admit; and he reque&s;ted of them to give him their advice with regard to the mo&s;t effectual means of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing that new here&s;y which had &s;prung up among them <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Fa&s;cic.

<P>THE members of the Diet, after prai&s;ing the Pope's pious and laudable intentions, excu&s;ed them&s;elves for not executing the edict of Worms, by alledging that the prodigious increa&s;e of Luther's followers, as well as the aver&s;ion to the court of Rome among their other &s;ubjects on account of its innumerable exactions, rendered &s;uch an attempt not only dangerous, but impo&s;&s;ible. They affirmed, that the grievances of Germany, which did not ari&s;e from imaginary injuries, but from impo&s;itions no

Such a council, there|fore, they advi&s;ed him, after obtaining the Emperor's con&s;ent, to a&s;&s;emble without delay, in one of the great cities of Germany, that all who had a right to be pre|&s;ent might deliberate with freedom, and propo&s;e their opinions with &s;uch boldne&s;s, as the dangerous &s;ituation of religion at this juncture required <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Fa&s;cic. Rer. Expet. &amp; Fugiend. p. 346.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE nuncio, more artful than his ma&s;ter, and bet|ter acquainted with the political views and intere&s;ts of the Roman court, was &s;tartled at the propo&s;ition of a council; and ea&s;ily fore&s;aw how dangerous &s;uch an a&s;|&s;embly might prove at a time when many openly denied the papal authority, and the reverence and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion yielded to it vi&s;ibly declined among all. For that rea&s;on he employed his utmo&s;t addre&s;s, in order to prevail on the members of the Diet to proceed them&s;elves with greater &s;everity again&s;t the Lutheran here&s;y, and to re|linqui&s;h their propo&s;al concerning a general council to be held in Germany, They, perceiving the nuncio to be more &s;olicitous about the intere&s;ts of the Roman court, than the tranquillity of the empire, or purity of the church, remained inflexible, and continued to prepare the catalogue of their grievances to be pre&s;ented to the Pope <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 349.</NOTE>.

<P>THE &s;ecular Princes accordingly, for the eccle&s;ia&s;|tics, although they gave no oppo&s;ition, did not think it decent to join with them, drew up the li&s;t (&s;o famous in the German annals) of an hundred grievances which the empire imputed to the iniquitous dominion of the papal &s;ee. This li&s;t contained grievances much of the &s;ame nature with that prepared under the reign of Maxi|milian. It would be tedious to enumerate each of

them; they complained of the &s;ums exacted for di&s;pen|&s;ations, ab&s;olutions and indulgences; of the expence ari&s;ing from the law-&s;uits carried to Rome; of the in|numerable abu&s;es occa&s;ioned by re&s;ervations, commen|dams, and annates; of the exemption from civil juri&s;|diction which the clergy had obtained; of the arts by which they brought all &s;ecular cau&s;es under the cogni|zance of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical judges; of the indecent and profligate lives which not a few of the clergy led; and of various other particulars, many of which have alrea|dy been mentioned among the circum&s;tances which con|tributed to the favourable reception, or to the quick progre&s;s of Luther's doctrines. In the end they con|cluded, that if the holy &s;ee did not &s;peedily deliver them from tho&s;e intolerable burdens, they had deter|mined to endure them no longer, and would employ the power and authority with which God had entru&s;ted them, in order to procure relief <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Fa&s;cic.

<P>INSTEAD of &s;uch &s;everities again&s;t Luther and his fol|lowers as the nuncio had recommended, the <HI>rece&s;s</HI> or edict of the Diet contained only a general injunction to all ranks of men to wait with patience for the determina|tions of the council which was to be a&s;&s;embled, and in the mean time not to publi&s;h any new opinions, contra|ry to the e&s;tabli&s;hed doctrines of the church; together with an admonition to all preachers to ab&s;tain from mat|ters of controver&s;y in their di&s;cour&s;es to the people, and to confine them&s;elves to the plain and in&s;tructive truths of religion <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 348.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE reformers derived great advantage from the tran&s;actions of this Diet, as they afforded them the ful|e&s;t and mo&s;t authentic evidence that gro&s;s corruptions prevailed in the court of Rome, and that the empire was loaded by the clergy with in&s;upportable burthens. With regard to the former, they had now the te&s;timony of the Pope him&s;elf, that their invectives and accu&s;ations were not malicious or ill-founded. As to the latter, the repre&s;entatives of the Germanick body, in an a&s;&s;embly where the patrons of the new opinions were far from be|ing the mo&s;t numerous or powerful, had pointed out as
<PB N="148" REF="011837_0556_0F9D885BEFA46558">
the chief grievances of the empire, tho&s;e very practices of the Romi&s;h church again&s;t which Luther and his di&s;ciples were accu&s;tomed to declaim. Accordingly, in all their controver&s;ial writings after this period, they often ap|pealed to Adrian's declaration, and to the hundred griev|ances, in confirmation of whatever they advanced con|cerning the di&s;&s;olute manners, or in&s;atiable ambition and rapaciou&s;ne&s;s of the papal court.</P>
<P>AT Rome, Adrian's conduct was con&s;idered as a proof of the mo&s;t childi&s;h &s;implicity and imprudence. Men trained up amid&s;t the artifices and corruptions of the papal court, and accu&s;tomed to judge of actions not by what was ju&s;t, but by what was u&s;eful, were a&s;toni&s;hed at a Pontiff, who, departing from the wi&s;e maxims of his predece&s;&s;ors, acknowledged di&s;orders which he ought to have concealed; and forgetting his own dignity, a&s;ked advice of tho&s;e, to whom he was entitled to pre&s;cribe. By &s;uch an exce&s;s of impolitic &s;in|cerity, they were afraid, that in&s;tead of reclaiming, he would render the enemies of the church more pre&s;ump|tuous, and in&s;tead of extingui&s;hing here&s;y, would weak|en the foundations of the papal power, or &s;top the chief &s;ources from which wealth flowed into the church <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">F. Paul. Hi&s;t. of Counc. p. 28. Pallavic. Hi&s;t. 58</NOTE>. For this rea&s;on they indu&s;triou&s;ly oppo&s;ed all his &s;chemes of reformation, and by throwing objections and diffi|culties in his way, endeavoured to retard or to de|feat the execution of them. Adrian, amazed on the one hand, at the ob&s;tinacy of the Lutherans, di&s;gu&s;ted, on the other, with the manners and maxims of the Ita|lians, and finding him&s;elf unable to correct either the one or the other, often lamented his own &s;ituation, and often looked back with plea&s;ure on that period of his life when he was only dean of Louvain, a more humble but happier &s;tation, in which little was expected from him, and there was nothing to fru&s;trate his good in|tentions <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ovii Vit.

was animated not only with the aver&s;ion which all Popes naturally bear to a council, but having gained his own election by means very uncanonical, he was afraid of an a&s;&s;embly that might &s;ubject it to a &s;crutiny which it could not &s;tand. He determined, therefore, to elude by every po&s;&s;ible means the demands of the Ger|mans, both with re&s;pect to the calling of a council, and reforming abu&s;es in the papal court, which the ra&s;hne&s;s and incapacity of his predece&s;&s;or had brought upon him. For this purpo&s;e he made choice of Cardinal Campeg|gio, an artful man, often entru&s;ted by the Popes with negociations of importance, as his nuncio to the Diet of the empire a&s;&s;embled again at Nuremberg.</P>
<P>CAMPEGGIO, without taking any notice of what had pa&s;&s;ed in the la&s;t meeting, exhorted the Diet in a long di&s;cour&s;e, to execute the edict of Worms with vigour, as the only effectual means of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing Luther's doc|trines. The Diet, in return, de&s;ired to know the Pope's intentions concerning the council, and the redre&s;s of the hundred grievances. The former, the nuncio endea|voured to elude by general and unmeaning declarations of the Pope's re&s;olution to pur&s;ue &s;uch mea&s;ures as would be for the greate&s;t good of the church. With regard to the latter, as the catalogue of grievances did not reach Rome till after Adrian's death, and of con&s;equence had not been regularly laid before the pre&s;ent Pope, Cam|peggio took advantage of this circum&s;tance to decline making any definitive an&s;wer to them in Clement's name; though, at the &s;ame <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">me, he ob&s;erved that their catalogue of grievances contained many particulars ex|tremely indecent and undutiful, and that the publi&s;hing it by their own authority was highly di&s;re&s;pectful to the Roman &s;ee.

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE REIGN OF THE EMPEROR CHARLES V. BOOK IV.</HEAD>
<P>THE expul&s;ion of the French, both out of the Milane&s;e, and the republick of Genoa, was con&s;idered by the Italians, as the con|clu&s;ion of the war between Charles and Francis; and as they began immediately to be appre|hen&s;ive of the Emperor, when they &s;aw no power re|maining in Italy capable either to controul or oppo&s;e him, they longed ardently for the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of peace. Having procured the re&s;toration of Sforza to his paternal dominions, which had been their chief mo|tive for entering into a confederacy with Charles, they plainly di&s;covered their intention to contribute no longer towards increa&s;ing the Emperor's &s;uperiority over his rival, which was already the object of their jealou&s;y. The Pope, e&s;pecially, who&s;e natural timidity increa&s;ed his &s;u&s;picions of Charles's de&s;igns, endeavoured by his amba&s;&s;adors and remon&s;trances to in&s;pire him with mo|deration, and incline him to peace.</P>
<P>BUT the Emperor, intoxicated with &s;ucce&s;s, and urged on by his own ambition, no le&s;s than by Bour|bon's de&s;ire of revenge, contemned Clement's admoni|tions, and declared his re&s;olution of ordering his army to pa&s;s the Alps, and to invade Provence, a part of his

rival's dominions where he lea&s;t dreaded an attack, and was lea&s;t prepared to re&s;i&s;t it. His mo&s;t experienced mini&s;ters di&s;&s;uaded him from undertaking &s;uch an en|terprize with a feeble army, and an exhau&s;ted trea&s;ury: But he relied &s;o much on having obtained the concur|rence of the King of England, and on the hopes which Bourbon, with the confidence and credulity natural to ex|iles, entertained of being joined by a numerous body of his parti&s;ans as &s;oon as the Imperial troops &s;hould enter France, that he per&s;i&s;ted ob&s;tinately in the mea&s;ure. Henry undertook to furni&s;h an hundred thou&s;and ducats towards defraying the expence of the expedition during the fir&s;t month, and had it in his choice either to con|tinue the payment of that &s;um monthly, or to invade Picardy before the end of July with a powerful army. The Emperor engaged to attack Guienne at the &s;ame time with a con&s;iderable body of men, and if the&s;e en|terprizes proved &s;ucce&s;sful, they agreed that Bourbon, be&s;ides the territories he had lo&s;t, &s;hould be put in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of Provence, with the title of King, and &s;hould do homage to Henry as the lawful King of France, for his new dominions. Of all the parts of this exten&s;ive but extravagant project, the inva&s;ion of Provence was the only one which was executed. For although Bour|bon, with a &s;crupulous delicacy, altogether unexpected, after the part he had acted, po&s;itively refu&s;ed to acknow|ledge Henry's title to the crown of France, and thereby ab&s;olved him from any obligation to promote the enter|prize, Charles's eagerne&s;s to carry his own plan into ex|ecution did not in any degree abate. The army he em|ployed for that purpo&s;e amounted only to eighteen thou|&s;and men; the &s;upreme command of which was given to the Marquis de Pe&s;cara, with in&s;tructions to pay the greate&s;t deference to Bourbon's advice in all his opera|tions. Pe&s;cara pa&s;&s;ed the Alps without oppo&s;ition, and entering Provence, laid &s;iege to Mar&s;eilles. Bourbon had advi&s;ed him rather to march towards Lyons, in the neigbourhood of which city his territories were &s;ituated, and where of cour&s;e his influence was mo&s;t exten&s;ive: But the Emperor was &s;o de&s;irous to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a port, which would, at all times, &s;ecure him ea&s;y acce&s;s into France, that by his authority he over-ruled the con|&s;table's

<P>FRANCIS, who fore&s;aw, but was unable to prevent this attempt, took the mo&s;t proper precautions to defeat it. He laid wa&s;te the adjacent country, in order to render it more difficult for the enemy to &s;ub&s;i&s;t their army; he razed the &s;uburbs of the city, &s;trengthened its fortifica|tions, and threw into it a numerous garri&s;on under the command of brave and experienced officers. To the&s;e, nine thou&s;and of the citizens, whom their dread of the Spani&s;h yoke in&s;pired with contempt of danger, joined them&s;elves; by their united courage and indu&s;try, all the efforts of Pe&s;cara's military &s;kill, and of Bourbon's activity and revenge, were rendered abortive. Francis, meanwhile, had lei&s;ure to a&s;&s;emble a powerful army un|der the walls of Avignon, and no &s;ooner began to ad|vance towards Mar&s;eilles, than the Imperial troops, ex|hau&s;ted by the fatigues of a &s;iege which had la&s;ted forty days, weakened by di&s;ea&s;es, and almo&s;t de&s;titute of pro|vi&s;ions, retired with precipitation towards Italy <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Guic. l. 15. 277.

<P>IF, during the&s;e operations of the army in Provence, either Charles or Henry had attacked France in the manner which they had projected, that kingdom mu&s;t have been expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t imminent danger. But on this, as well as on many other occa&s;ions, the Emperor found that the extent of his revenues was not adequate to the greatne&s;s of his power, or the ardour of his ambi|tion, and the want of money obliged him, though with much reluctance, to circum&s;cribe his plan, and to leave part of it unexecuted. Henry, di&s;gu&s;ted at Bourbon's refu&s;ing to recognize his right to the crown of France; alarmed at the motions of the Scots, whom the &s;olicita|tions of the French King had per&s;uaded to march to|wards the borders of England; and no longer incited by his mini&s;ter, who was become extremely cool with regard to the Emperor's intere&s;ts; took no mea&s;ures to &s;upport an enterprize, of which, as of all new under|takings, he had been at fir&s;t exce&s;&s;ively fond <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Fiddes's Life of Wol&s;ey.

<P><PB N="154" REF="011837_0562_0F9D88607036A2D8">IF the King of France had been &s;atisfied with having delivered his &s;ubjects from this formidable inva&s;ion, and having &s;hewn all Europe the facility with which the in|ternal &s;trength of his dominions enabled him to re&s;i&s;t the impre&s;&s;ions of a foreign enemy, even when &s;econded by the abilities and powerful efforts of a rebellious &s;ub|ject, the campaign, notwith&s;tanding the lo&s;s of the Mi|lane&s;e, would have been far from ending ingloriou&s;ly. But Francis, animated with courage more becoming a &s;oldier than a general; pu&s;hed on by ambition, enter|prizing rather than con&s;iderate; and too apt to be elated with &s;ucce&s;s; was fond of every undertaking that &s;eem|ed bold and adventurous. Such an undertaking the &s;i|tuation of his affairs at that juncture, naturally pre&s;ent|ed to his view. He had under his command one of the mo&s;t powerful and be&s;t appointed armies France had ever brought into the field, which he could not think of di&s;banding without having employed it in any &s;ervice. The Imperial troops had been obliged to retire almo&s;t ruined by hard duty, and di&s;heartened with ill &s;ucce&s;s; the Milane&s;e had been left altogether without defence; it was not impo&s;&s;ible to reach that country before Pe&s;cara, with his &s;hattered forces, could arrive there; or if fear &s;hould add &s;peed to their retreat, they were in no con|dition to make head again&s;t his fre&s;h and numerous troops; and Milan would now, as in former in&s;tances, &s;ubmit without re&s;i&s;tance to a bold invader. Tho&s;e con&s;iderations, which were not de&s;titute of plau&s;ibility, appeared to his &s;anguine temper to be of the utmo&s;t weight. In vain did his wi&s;e&s;t mini&s;ters and generals repre&s;ent to him the danger of taking the field at a &s;ea|&s;on &s;o far advanced, with an army compo&s;ed chiefly of Swi&s;s and Germans, to who&s;e caprices he would be &s;ub|ject in all his operations, and on who&s;e fidelity his &s;afety mu&s;t ab&s;olutely depend. In vain did Loui&s;e of Savoy advance by ha&s;ty journies towards Provence, that &s;he might exert all her authority in di&s;&s;uading her &s;on from &s;uch a ra&s;h enterprize. Francis di&s;regarded the remon|&s;trances of his &s;ubjects; and that he might &s;ave him&s;elf the pain of an interview with his mother, who&s;e coun|&s;els he had determined to reject, he began his march before her arrival; appointing her, however, by way of

atonement for that neglect, to be regent of the kingdom during his ab&s;ence. Bonnivet, by his per&s;ua&s;ions, con|tributed not a little to confirm Francis in this re&s;olution. That favourite, who &s;trongly re&s;embled his ma&s;ter in all the defective parts of his character, was led by his na|tural impetuo&s;ity, warmly to approve of &s;uch an enter|prize; and being prompted, be&s;ides, by his impatience to revi&s;it a Milane&s;e lady, of whom he had been deeply enamoured during his late expedition, he is &s;aid, by his flattering de&s;criptions of her beauty and accompli&s;h|ments, to have in&s;pired Francis, who was extremely &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;uch pa&s;&s;ions, with an equal de&s;ire of &s;ee|ing her <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">euv. de Brant. tom. vi. 253.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE French pa&s;&s;ed the Alps at mount Cenis; and as their &s;ucce&s;s depended on di&s;patch, they advanced with the greate&s;t diligence. Pe&s;cara, who had been obliged to take a longer and more difficult rout by Monaco and Final, was &s;oon informed of their intention; and being &s;en&s;ible that nothing but the pre&s;ence of his troops could &s;ave the Milane&s;e, marched with &s;uch rapidity, that he reached Alva on the &s;ame day that the French army ar|rived at Vercelli. Francis, in&s;tructed by Bonnivet's er|ror in the former campaign, advanced directly towards Milan, where the unexpected approach of an enemy &s;o powerful, occa&s;ioned &s;uch con&s;ternation and di&s;order, that although Pe&s;cara entered the city with &s;ome of his be&s;t troops, he found that the defence of it could not be undertaken with any probability of &s;ucce&s;s; and having thrown a garri&s;on into the citadel, retired through one gate, while the French were admitted at another <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Bellay, p. 81.

In &s;uch a &s;ituation, it required all the wi&s;|dom of Lannoy, the intrepidity of Pe&s;cara, and the im|placable re&s;entment of Bourbon, to pre&s;erve them from &s;inking under de&s;pair, and to in&s;pire them with re&s;olu|tion to attempt, or &s;agacity to di&s;cover what was e&s;&s;ential to their &s;afety. To the efforts of their genius, and the activity of their zeal, the Emperor was more indebted for the pre&s;ervation of his Italian dominions than to his own power.

<P>FRANCIS, by a fatal error, allowed the Emperor's ge|nerals time to derive advantage from all the&s;e opera|tions. In&s;tead of pur&s;uing the enemy, who retired to Lodi on the Adda, an untenable po&s;t, which Pe&s;cara had re&s;olved to abandon on his approach, he, in com|pliance with the opinion of Bonnivet, though contrary to that of his other generals, laid &s;iege to Pavia on the Te&s;ino; a town, indeed, of great importance, the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of which would have opened to him all the fertile country lying on the banks of that river. But the forti|fications

of the place were &s;trong; it was dangerous to undertake a difficult &s;iege at &s;o late a &s;ea&s;on; and the Imperial generals, &s;en&s;ible of its con&s;equence, had thrown into the town a garri&s;on of &s;ix thou&s;and veterans, under the command of Antonio de Leyva, an officer of high rank; of great experience; of a patient but enterprizing courage; fertile in re&s;ources; ambitious of di&s;tingui&s;h|ing him&s;elf; and capable, for that rea&s;on, as well as from his having been long accu&s;tomed both to obey and to command, of &s;uffering or performing any thing in order to procure &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>FRANCIS pro&s;ecuted the &s;iege with ob&s;tinacy equal to the ra&s;hne&s;s with which he had undertaken it. During three months, every thing known to the engineers of that age, or that could be effected by the valour of his troops, was attempted in order to reduce the place; while Lannoy and Pe&s;cara, unable to ob&s;truct his ope|rations, were obliged to remain in &s;uch an ignominious &s;tate of inaction, that a Pa&s;quinade was publi&s;hed at Rome, offering a reward to any per&s;on who could find the Imperial army, lo&s;t in the month of October in the mountains between France and Lombardy, and which had not been heard of &s;ince that time <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Sandov. i. 608.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>LEYVA, well acquainted with the difficulties under which his countrymen laboured, and the impo&s;&s;ibility of their facing, in the field, &s;uch a powerful army as form|ed the &s;iege of Pavia, placed his only hopes of &s;afety in his own vigilance and valour. The efforts of both were extraordinary, and in proportion to the importance of the place, with the defence of which he was entru&s;ted. He interrupted the approaches of the French by fre|quent and furious &s;allies. Behind the breaches which their artillery made, he erected new works, that ap|peared to be &s;carce inferior in &s;trength to the original fortifications. He repul&s;ed the be&s;iegers in all their a&s;|&s;aults; and by his own example, brought not only the garri&s;on, but the inhabitants to bear the mo&s;t intolerable fatigues, and to encounter the greate&s;t dangers without murmuring. The rigour of the &s;ea&s;on con&s;pired with his endeavours in retarding the progre&s;s of the French.

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the &s;low progre&s;s of the be|&s;iegers, and the glory which Leyva acquired by his gal|lant defence, it was not doubted but that the town would at la&s;t be obliged to &s;urrender. The Pope, who alrea|dy con&s;idered the French arms as &s;uperior in Italy, be|came impatient to di&s;engage him&s;elf from his connec|tions with the Emperor, of who&s;e de&s;igns he was ex|tremely jealous; and to enter into terms of friend&s;hip with Francis. As Clement's timid and cautious temper rendered him incapable of following the bold plan which Leo had formed of delivering Italy from the yoke of both the rivals, he returned to the more obvious and practicable &s;cheme of employing the power of the one to balance and to re&s;train that of the other. For this rea|&s;on, he did not di&s;&s;emble his &s;atisfaction at &s;eeing the French King recover Milan, as he hoped that the dread of &s;uch a neighbour would be &s;ome check upon the Emperor's ambition, which no power in Italy was now able to controul. He laboured hard to bring about a peace that would &s;ecure Francis in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his new conque&s;ts; and as Charles, who was always in|flexible in the pro&s;ecution of his &s;chemes, rejected the propo&s;ition with di&s;dain, and with bitter exclamations again&s;t the Pope, by who&s;e per&s;ua&s;ions, while Cardinal de Medici, he had been induced to invade the Milane&s;e, Clement immediately concluded a treaty of neutrality with the King of France, in which the republick of Flo|rence was included <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Guic. l. 15. 282. 285.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FRANCIS having by this tran&s;action, deprived the Em|peror of his two mo&s;t powerful allies, and at the &s;ame time having &s;ecured a pa&s;&s;age for his own troops thro' their territories, formed a &s;cheme of attacking the kingdom of Naples, hoping either to over-run that

country, which was left altogether without defence, or that at lea&s;t &s;uch an unexpected inva&s;ion would oblige the viceroy to recal part of the Imperial army out of the Milane&s;e. For this purpo&s;e he ordered &s;ix thou&s;and men to march under the command of John Stuart Duke of Albany. But Pe&s;cara fore&s;eeing that the effect of this diver&s;ion would depend entirely upon the operations of the armies in the Milane&s;e, per&s;uaded Lannoy to di&s;re|gard Albany's motions <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Guic. l. 15. 285.</NOTE>, and to bend his whole force again&s;t the King him&s;elf; &s;o that Francis not only weak|ened his army very un&s;ea&s;onably by this great detach|ment; but incurred the reproach of engaging too ra&s;h|ly in chimerical and extravagant projects.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE the garri&s;on of Pavia was reduced to extremity; their ammunitions and provi&s;ions began to fail; the Germans, of whom it was chiefly compo&s;ed, having received no pay for &s;even months <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Gold. Polit. Imperial. 875.</NOTE>, threatened to deliver the town into the enemies hands, and could &s;carce be retained from mutiny by all Leyva's addre&s;s and authority. The Imperial generals, who were no &s;trangers to his &s;ituation, &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of marching without lo&s;s of time to his relief. This they had now in their power: Twelve thou&s;and Germans, whom the zeal and activity of Bourbon taught to move with unu|&s;ual rapidity, had entered Lombardy under his com|mand, and rendered the Imperial army nearly equal to that of the French, greatly dimini&s;hed by the ab&s;ence of the body under Albany, as well as by the fatigues of the &s;iege, and the rigour of the &s;ea&s;on. But the more their troops increa&s;ed in number, the more &s;en&s;ibly did they feel the di&s;tre&s;s ari&s;ing from want of money. Far from having funds for paying a powerful army, they had &s;carce what was &s;ufficient for defraying the charges of conducting their artillery, and of carrying their am|munition and provi&s;ions. The abilities of the gene|rals, however, &s;upplied every defect. By their own example, as well as by magnificent promi&s;es, in the name of the Emperor, they prevailed on the troops of all the different nations which compo&s;ed their army, to take the field without pay; they engaged to lead them

directly towards the enemy; and flattered them with the certain pro&s;pect of victory, which would at once en|rich them with &s;uch royal &s;poils as would be an ample reward for all their &s;ervices. The &s;oldiers, &s;en&s;ible that by quitting the army, they would forfeit the va&s;t ar|rears due to them, and eager to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the promi&s;ed trea&s;ures, demanded a battle with all the im|patience of adventurers who fought only for plunder <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Eryci Peuteani Hi&s;t.

<P>THE Imperial generals, without &s;uffering the ardour of their troops to cool, advanced immediately towards the French camp. On the fir&s;t intelligence of their ap|proach, Francis called a council of war, to deliberate what cour&s;e he ought to take. All his officers of great|e&s;t experience were unanimous in advi&s;ing him to re|tire, and to decline a battle with an enemy who courted it from de&s;pair. The leaders of the Imperiali&s;ts, they ob&s;erved, would either be obliged in a few weeks to di&s;|band an army, which they were unable to pay, and which they kept together only by the hope of pillage, or the &s;oldiers enraged at the non-performance of the promi&s;es to which they had tru&s;ted, would ri&s;e in &s;ome furious mutiny which would allow them to think of nothing but their own &s;afety: That, meanwhile, he might encamp in &s;ome &s;trong po&s;t, and waiting in &s;afe|ty the arrival of fre&s;h troops from France and Swit|zerland, might, before the end of &s;pring, take po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of all the Milane&s;e, without danger, or blood&s;hed. But in oppo&s;ition to them, Bonnivet, who&s;e de&s;tiny it was to give coun&s;els fatal to France during the whole campaign, repre&s;ented the ignominy it would reflect on their Sovereign if he &s;hould abandon a &s;iege which he had pro&s;ecuted &s;o long, or turn his back before an ene|my to whom he was &s;till &s;uperior in number; and in|&s;i&s;ted on the nece&s;&s;ity of fighting the Imperiali&s;ts rather than relinqui&s;h an undertaking, on the &s;ucce&s;s of which the King's future fame depended. Unfortunately, Francis's notions of honour were delicate to an exce&s;s that bordered on what was romantic. Having often &s;aid that he would take Pavia, or peri&s;h in the attempt,
<PB N="161" REF="011837_0569_0F9D8865AFD0B900">
he thought him&s;elf bound not to depart from that re|&s;olution; and rather than expo&s;e him&s;elf to the &s;lighte&s;t imputation, he cho&s;e to forego all the advantages which were the certain con&s;equences of a retreat, and deter|mined to wait for the Imperiali&s;ts before the walls of Pavia <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Guic. l. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. 291.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Imperial generals found the French &s;o &s;trongly entrenched, that notwith&s;tanding the powerful motives which urged them on, they he&s;itated long before they ventured to attack them; but at la&s;t, the nece&s;&s;ities of the be&s;ieged, and the murmurs of their own &s;oldiers obliged them to put every thing to hazard. Never did armies engage with greater ardour, or with an higher opinion of the importance of the battle they were going to fight; never were troops more &s;trongly animated with emulation, national antipathy, mutual re&s;entment, and all the pa&s;&s;ions which in&s;pire ob&s;tinate bravery. On the one hand, a gallant young Monarch, &s;econded by a generous nobility, and followed by &s;ubjects to who&s;e natural impetuo&s;ity, indignation at the oppo&s;ition they had encountered, added new force, contended for victory and honour. On the other &s;ide, troops more completely di&s;ciplined, and conducted by generals of greater abilities, fought from nece&s;&s;ity, with courage heightened by de&s;pair. The Imperiali&s;ts, however, were unable to re&s;i&s;t the fir&s;t efforts of the French va|lour, and their firme&s;t battalions began to give way. But the fortune of the day was quickly changed. The Swi&s;s in the &s;ervice of France, unmindful of the repu|tation of their country for fidelity and martial glory, abandoned their po&s;t in a cowardly manner. Levya, with his garri&s;on, &s;allied out and attacked the rear of the French during the heat of the action with &s;uch fu|ry as threw it into confu&s;ion; and Pe&s;cara falling on their cavalry, with the Imperial hor&s;e, among whom he had prudently intermingled a con&s;iderable number of Spani&s;h foot, armed with the heavy mu&s;kets then in u&s;e, broke this formidable body by an unu&s;ual method of attack again&s;t which they were wholly unprovided. The rout became univer&s;al; and re&s;i&s;tance cea&s;ed in al|mo&s;t

every part, but where the King was in per&s;on, who fought now, not for fame or victory, but for &s;afe|ty. Though wounded in &s;everal places, and thrown from his hor&s;e, which was killed under him, Francis defended him&s;elf on foot with an heroic courage. Ma|ny of his brave&s;t officers gathering round him, and en|deavouring to &s;ave his life at the expence of their own, fell at his feet. Among the&s;e was Bonnivet, the au|thor of this great calamity, who alone died unlamented. The King, exhau&s;ted with fatigue, and &s;carce capable of farther re&s;i&s;tance, was left almo&s;t alone, expo&s;ed to the fury of &s;ome Spani&s;h &s;oldiers, &s;trangers to his rank, and enraged at his ob&s;tinacy. At that moment came up Pomperant, a French gentleman, who had entered together with Bourbon into the Emperor's &s;ervice, and placing him&s;elf by the &s;ide of the Monarch again&s;t whom he had rebelled, a&s;&s;i&s;ted in protecting him from the violence of the &s;oldiers; at the &s;ame time be&s;eech|ing him to &s;urrender to Bourbon, who was not far di&s;|tant. Imminent as the danger was which now &s;urround|ed Francis, he rejected with indignation the thoughts of an action which would have afforded &s;uch matter of tri|umph to his traiterous &s;ubject; and calling for Lannoy, who happened likewi&s;e to be near at hand, gave up his &s;word to him; which he, kneeling to ki&s;s the King's hand, received with profound re&s;pect; and taking his own &s;word from his &s;ide, pre&s;ented it to him, &s;aying, That it did not become &s;o great a Monarch to remain di&s;armed in the pre&s;ence of one of the Emperor's &s;ub|jects <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Guic. l. 15. 292.

<P>TEN thou&s;and men fell on this day, one of the mo&s;t fatal France had ever &s;een. Among the&s;e were many noblemen of the highe&s;t di&s;tinction, who cho&s;e rather to peri&s;h than to turn their backs with di&s;honour. Not a few were taken pri&s;oners, of whom the mo&s;t illu&s;tri|ous was Henry D'Albret, the unfortunate King of Na|varre. A &s;mall body of the rear-guard made its e&s;cape under the command of the Duke Alen&s;on; the feeble

garri&s;on of Milan on the fir&s;t news of the defeat, retired without being pur&s;ued, by another road; and in two weeks after the battle, not a Frenchman remained in Italy.</P>
<P>LANNOY, though he treated Francis with all the out|ward marks of honour due to his rank and character, guarded him with the utmo&s;t attention. He was &s;oli|citous, not only to prevent any po&s;&s;ibility of his e&s;cap|ing, but afraid that his own troops might &s;eize his per|&s;on, and detain it as the be&s;t &s;ecurity for the payment of their arrears. In order to provide again&s;t both the&s;e dangers, he conducted Francis, the day after the battle, to the &s;trong ca&s;tle of Pizzichiton&egrave;, near Cremona, com|mitting him to the cu&s;tody of Don Ferdinand Alarcon, general of the Spani&s;h infantry, an officer of great bra|very, and of &s;trict honour, but remarkable for that &s;e|vere and &s;crupulous vigilance which &s;uch a tru&s;t re|quired.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, Francis, who formed a judgment of the Emperor's di&s;po&s;itions by his own, was extremely de&s;irous that Charles &s;hould be informed of his &s;itua|tion, fondly hoping, that from his genero&s;ity or &s;ympa|thy, he would obtain &s;peedy relief. The Imperial ge|nerals were no le&s;s impatient to give their Sovereign an early account of the deci&s;ive victory which they had gained, and to receive his in&s;tructions with regard to their future conduct. As the mo&s;t certain and expedi|tious method of conveying intelligence to Spain, at that &s;ea&s;on of the year, was by land, Francis gave the Com|mendador Pennalo&s;a, who was charged with Lannoy's di&s;patches, a pa&s;&s;port to travel through France.</P>
<P>CHARLES received the account of this &s;ignal and unexpected &s;ucce&s;s that had crowned his arms, with a moderation, which, if it had been real, would have done him more honour than the greate&s;t victory. Without uttering one word expre&s;&s;ive of exultation, or of intemperate joy, he retired immediately into his chapel, and having &s;pent an hour in offering up his thank&s;givings to heaven, returned to the pre&s;ence-chamber, which by that time was filled with grandees and foreign amba&s;&s;adors, a&s;&s;embled in order to congra|tulate him: He accepted of their compliments with a

mode&s;t deportment; he lamented the misfortune of the captive King, as a &s;triking example of the &s;ad rever&s;e of fortune, to which the mo&s;t powerful Monarchs are &s;ubject; he forbad any publick rejoicings, as indecent in a war carried on among Chri&s;tians, re&s;erving them un|til he &s;hould obtain a victory equally illu&s;trious over the Infidels; and &s;eemed to take plea&s;ure in the advantage he had gained, only as it would prove the occa&s;ion of re&s;toring peace to Chri&s;tendom <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Sandov. Hi&s;t. i. 651. Ulloa Vita dell Carlo V. p. 110.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CHARLES, however, had already begun to form &s;chemes in his own mind, which little &s;uited &s;uch ex|ternal appearances. Ambition, not genero&s;ity, was the ruling pa&s;&s;ion in his mind; and the victory at Pavia opened &s;uch new and unbounded pro&s;pects of gratify|ing it, as allured him with irre&s;i&s;tible force: But it be|ing no ea&s;y matter to execute the va&s;t de&s;igns which he meditated, he thought it nece&s;&s;ary, while proper mea|&s;ures were taking for that purpo&s;e, to affect the greate&s;t moderation, hoping under that veil to conceal his real intentions from the other Princes of Europe.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE France was filled with con&s;ternation. The King him&s;elf had early tran&s;mitted an account of the rout at Pavia in a letter to his mother, delivered by Pennalo&s;a, which contained only the&s;e words: "Ma|dam, all is lo&s;t except our honour." Tho&s;e who &s;urviv|ed, when they arrived from Italy, brought &s;uch a me|lancholy detail of particulars, as made all ranks of men &s;en&s;ibly feel the greatne&s;s and extent of the calamity. France, without its Sovereign, without money in her trea&s;ury, without an army, without officers to command it, and encompa&s;&s;ed on all &s;ides by a victorious and ac|tive enemy, &s;eemed to be on the very brink of de&s;truc|tion. But on that occa&s;ion the great abilities of Loui&s;e the Regent &s;aved the kingdom, which the violence of her pa&s;&s;ions had more than once expo&s;ed to the greate&s;t danger. In&s;tead of giving her&s;elf up to &s;uch lamenta|tions as were natural to a woman &s;o remarkable for her maternal tenderne&s;s, &s;he di&s;covered all the fore&s;ight, and exerted all the activity of a con&s;umate politician. She a&s;&s;embled the nobles at Lyons, and animated them
<PB N="165" REF="011837_0573_0F9D8868B10535A8">
by her example no le&s;s than by her words, with &s;uch zeal in defence of their country as its pre&s;ent &s;ituation re|quired. She collected the remains of the army which had &s;erved in Italy, ran&s;omed the pri&s;oners, paid their arrears, and put them in a condition to take the field. She levied new troops, provided for the &s;ecurity of the frontiers, and rai&s;ed &s;ums &s;ufficient for defraying the&s;e extraordinary expences. Her chief care, however, was to appea&s;e the re&s;entment, or to gain the friend&s;hip of the King of England; and from that quarter, the fir&s;t ray of comfort broke in upon the French affairs.</P>
<P>THOUGH Henry, in entering into alliances with Charles or Francis, &s;eldom followed any regular or con|certed plan of policy, but was influenced chiefly by the caprice of temporary pa&s;&s;ions, &s;uch occurrences often happened as recalled his attention towards that equal balance of power which it was nece&s;&s;ary to keep between the two contending potentates, the pre&s;ervation of which he always boa&s;ted to be his peculiar office. He had ex|pected that his union with the Emperor might afford him an opportunity of recovering &s;ome part of tho&s;e ter|ritories in France which had belonged to his ance&s;tors, and for the &s;ake of &s;uch an acqui&s;ition he did not &s;cruple to give his a&s;&s;i&s;tance towards rai&s;ing Charles to a con&s;iderable pre-eminence above Francis. He had never dreamt, how|ever, of any event &s;o deci&s;ive and &s;o fatal as the victory at Pavia, which &s;eemed not only to have broken, but to have annihilated the power of one of the rivals; &s;o that the pro&s;pect of the &s;udden and entire revolution which this would occa&s;ion in the political &s;y&s;tem, filled him with the mo&s;t di&s;quieting apprehen&s;ions. He &s;aw all Europe in danger of being over-run by an ambitious Prince, to who&s;e power there now remained no coun|terpoi&s;e; and though he him&s;elf might at fir&s;t be ad|mitted, in quality of an ally, to &s;ome &s;hare in the &s;poils of the captive Monarch, it was ea&s;y to di&s;cern that with regard to the manner of making the partition, as well as his &s;ecurity for keeping po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what &s;hould be allotted him, he mu&s;t ab&s;olutely depend upon the will of a confederate, to who&s;e forces his own bore no proportion. He was &s;en&s;ible that if Charles were per|mitted to add any con&s;iderable part of France to the va&s;t
<PB N="166" REF="011837_0574_0F9D88696F5E6B48">
dominions of which he was already ma&s;ter, his neigh|bourhood would be much more formidable to England than that of the antient French Kings; while, at the &s;ame time, the proper balance on the continent, to which England owed both its &s;afety and importance, would be entirely lo&s;t. Concern for the &s;ituation of the unhappy Monarch co-operated with the&s;e political con&s;iderations; his gallant behaviour in the battle of Pavia had excited an high degree of admiration, which never fails of augmenting &s;ympathy; and Henry, natu|rally &s;u&s;ceptible of generous &s;entiments, was fond of ap|pearing as the deliverer of a vanqui&s;hed enemy from a &s;tate of captivity. The pa&s;&s;ions of the Engli&s;h mini&s;ter, &s;econded the inclinations of the Monarch. Wol&s;ey, who had not forgot the di&s;appointment of his hopes in two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive conclaves, which he imputed chiefly to the Emperor, thought this a proper opportunity of taking revenge; and Loui&s;e courting the friend&s;hip of England with &s;uch flattering &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions, as were no le&s;s agree|able to the King than to the Cardinal, Henry gave her &s;ecret a&s;&s;urances that he would not lend his aid towards oppre&s;&s;ing France, in its pre&s;ent helple&s;s &s;tate, and obliged her to promi&s;e that &s;he would not con&s;ent to di&s;member the kingdom, even in order to procure her &s;on's liberty <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Bellay, 94. Guic. l. 16. 318. Herbert.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT as Henry's connections with the Emperor made it nece&s;&s;ary to act in &s;uch a manner, as to &s;ave appear|ances, he ordered public rejoicings to be made in his dominions for the &s;ucce&s;s of the Imperial arms; and as if he had been eager to &s;eize the pre&s;ent opportunity of ruining the French monarchy, he &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to Madrid, to congratulate with Charles upon his vic|tory; to put him in mind, that he, as his ally, engaged in one common cau&s;e, was entitled to partake in the fruits of it; and to require that in compliance with the terms of their confederacy, he would invade Guienne with a powerful army, in order to give him po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that province. At the &s;ame time, he offered to &s;end the Prince&s;s Mary into Spain or the Low-Countries, that &s;he might be educated under the Emperor's direc|tion
<PB N="167" REF="011837_0575_0F9D886A2FDE8440">
until the conclu&s;ion of the marriage agreed on be|tween them; and in return for that mark of his confi|dence, he in&s;i&s;ted that Francis &s;hould be delivered to him, in con&s;equence of that article in the treaty of Bru|ges, whereby each of the contracting parties was bound to &s;urrender all u&s;urpers to him who&s;e rights they had in|vaded. It was impo&s;&s;ible that Henry could expect that the Emperor would li&s;ten to the&s;e extravagant demands, which it was neither his intere&s;t, nor in his power to grant. They appear evidently to have been made with no other intention than to furni&s;h him with a decent pre|text for entering into &s;uch engagements with France as the juncture required <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 64.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT was among the Italian &s;tates, that the victory at Pavia occa&s;ioned the greate&s;t alarm and terror. That balance of power on which they relied for their &s;ecurity, and which it had been the con&s;tant object of all their ne|gociations and refinements to maintain, was de&s;troyed in a moment. They were expo&s;ed by their &s;ituation to feel the fir&s;t effects of the uncontrouled authority Charles had acquired. They ob&s;erved many &s;ymptoms of a boundle&s;s ambition in that young Prince, and were &s;en&s;ible, that as Emperor, or King of Naples, he could either form dangerous preten&s;ions upon each of their territories, or invade them with great advantage. They deliberated, therefore, with much &s;olicitude concerning the means of rai&s;ing &s;uch a force as might ob&s;truct his progre&s;s <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Guic. l. 16. 300. Ru&s;celli Lettere de Princ. ii. 74, 76, &amp;c. Thuani Hi&s;t. lib. i. c. 11.</NOTE>. But their con&s;ultations, conducted with little union, and executed with le&s;s vigour, had no ef|fect. Clement, in&s;tead of pur&s;uing the mea&s;ures which he had concerted with the Venetians for &s;ecuring the liberty of Italy, was &s;o intimidated by Lannoy's threats, or overcome by his promi&s;es, that he entered into a &s;eparate treaty, binding him&s;elf to advance a con|&s;iderable &s;um in return for certain emoluments which he was to receive. The money was in&s;tantly paid; Charles afterwards refu&s;ed to ratify the treaty; and the Pope remained expo&s;ed at once to infamy and to ridicule; to
<PB N="168" REF="011837_0576_0F9D886AF0221138">
the former, becau&s;e he had de&s;erted the publick cau&s;e for his private intere&s;t; to the latter, becau&s;e he had been a lo&s;er by that unworthy action <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Guic. l. 16. 305. Mauroceni Hi&s;tor. Venet ap I&s;torichi delle co&s;e Venez. V. 131, 136.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HOW di&s;honourable &s;oever the artifice might be which was employed in order to defraud the Pope of this &s;um, it came very &s;ea&s;onably into the viceroy's hands, and put it in his power to extricate him&s;elf out of an immi|nent danger. Soon after the defeat of the French army, the German troops which had defended Pavia with &s;uch meritorious courage and per&s;everance, growing in&s;olent upon the fame they had acquired, and impatient of re|lying any longer on fruitle&s;s promi&s;es with which they had been &s;o often amu&s;ed, rendered them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the town, with a re&s;olution to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it as a &s;ecurity for the payment of their arrears, and the re&s;t of the army di&s;covered a much &s;tronger inclination to a&s;&s;i&s;t, than to puni&s;h the mutineers. By dividing among them the money exacted from the Pope, Lannoy quieted the tumultuous Germans; but though this &s;a|tisfied their pre&s;ent demands, he had &s;o little pro&s;pect of being able to pay them or his other forces regularly for the future, and was under &s;uch continual apprehen|&s;ions of their &s;eizing the per&s;on of the captive King, that not long after, he was obliged to di&s;mi&s;s all the Ger|mans and Italians in the Imperial &s;ervice <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Guic. l. 16. p. 302.</NOTE>. Thus, from a circum&s;tance that now appears very &s;ingular, but ari&s;ing naturally from the con&s;titution of mo&s;t European governments in the &s;ixteenth century, while Charles was &s;u&s;pected by all his neighbours of aiming at univer&s;al monarchy, and while he was really forming va&s;t projects of this kind, his revenues were &s;o limited, that he could not keep on foot his victorious army, though it did not exceed twenty-four thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>DURING the&s;e tran&s;actions, Charles, who&s;e preten|&s;ions to moderation and di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s were &s;oon for|gotten, deliberated with the utmo&s;t &s;olicitude, how he might derive the greate&s;t advantages from the misfor|tune of his adver&s;ary. Some of his coun&s;ellors advi&s;ed him to treat Francis with the magnanimity that became
<PB N="169" REF="011837_0577_0F9D886BAF775E00">
a victorious Prince, and in&s;tead of taking advantage of his &s;ituation to impo&s;e rigorous conditions, to di&s;mi&s;s him on &s;uch equal terms, as would bind him for ever to his intere&s;t by the ties of gratitude and affection, more forcible, as well as more permanent, than any which could be formed by extorted oaths and involuntary &s;ti|pulations. Such an exertion of genero&s;ity is not, per|haps, to be expected in the conduct of political affairs, and it was far too refined for that Prince to whom it was propo&s;ed. The more obvious, but le&s;s &s;plendid &s;cheme of endeavouring to make the utmo&s;t of Francis's calamity, had a greater number in the council to recom|mend it, and &s;uited better with the Emperor's genius. But though Charles adopted this plan, he did not execute it in a proper manner. In&s;tead of making one great effort to penetrate into France with all the forces of Spain and the Low-Countries; in&s;tead of cru&s;hing the Italian &s;tates before they recovered from the con&s;terna|tion which the &s;ucce&s;s of his arms had occa&s;ioned; he had recour&s;e to the artifices of intrigue and negociation. This proceeded partly from nece&s;&s;ity, partly from the natural di&s;po&s;ition of his mind. The &s;ituation of his finances at that time rendered it extremely difficult to carry on any extraordinary armament; and he him&s;elf having never appeared at the head of his armies, the command of which he had hitherto committed to his generals, was aver&s;e from bold and martial coun&s;els, and tru&s;ted more to the arts with which he was acquainted. He laid, be&s;ides, too much &s;tre&s;s upon the victory of Pavia, as if by that event the &s;trength of France had been annihilated, its re&s;ources exhau&s;ted, and the king|dom it&s;elf, no le&s;s than the per&s;on of its Monarch, had been &s;ubjected to his power.</P>
<P>FULL of this opinion, he determined to &s;et the highe&s;t price upon Francis's freedom, and having appointed the Count de Roeux to vi&s;it the captive King in his name, he in&s;tructed him to propo&s;e the following articles, as the conditions on which he would grant him his liberty; that he &s;hould re&s;tore Burgundy to the Emperor, from who&s;e ance&s;tors it had been unju&s;tly wre&s;ted; that he &s;hould &s;urrender Provence and Dauphin&egrave;, that they might be erected into an independent kingdom for the Con&s;table
<PB N="170" REF="011837_0578_0F9D886C6F5687C0">
Bourbon; that he &s;hould make full &s;atisfaction to the King of England for all his claims; and finally, re|nounce the preten&s;ions of France to Naples, Milan, or any other territory in Italy. When Francis, who had hitherto flattered him&s;elf that he &s;hould be treated by the Emperor with the genero&s;ity becoming one great Prince towards another, heard the&s;e rigorous conditions, he was &s;o tran&s;ported with indignation, that drawing his dagger ha&s;tily, he cried out, <Q>'Twere better that a King &s;hould die thus.</Q> Alarcon, alarmed at his vehemence, laid hold on his hand; but though he &s;oon recovered greater compo&s;ure, he &s;till declared in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, that he would rather remain a pri&s;oner during life, than purcha&s;e liberty by &s;uch ignominious conce&s;&s;ions <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Bellay, 94. Ferrera's Hi&s;t. ix. 43.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS mortifying di&s;covery of the Emperor's inten|tions, greatly augmented Francis's chagrin and impa|tience under his confinement, and mu&s;t have driven him to ab&s;olute de&s;pair, if he had not laid hold of the only thing which &s;till could admini&s;ter to him any comfort. He per&s;uaded him&s;elf, that the conditions which Roeux had propo&s;ed, did not flow originally from Charles him|&s;elf, but were dictated by the rigorous policy of his Spani&s;h council, and that therefore he might hope in one per&s;onal interview with him, to do more towards ha&s;tening his own deliverance, than could be effected by long negociations pa&s;&s;ing through the &s;ubordinate hands of his mini&s;ters. Relying on this &s;uppo&s;ition, which proceeded from too favourable an opinion of the Em|peror's character, he offered to vi&s;it him in Spain, and was willing to be carried thither as a &s;pectacle to that haughty nation. Lannoy employed all his addre&s;s to confirm him in the&s;e &s;entiments; and concerted with him in &s;ecret the manner of executing this re&s;olution. Francis was &s;o eager on a &s;cheme which &s;eemed to open &s;ome pro&s;pect of liberty, that he furni&s;hed the gallies nece&s;&s;ary for the voyage, Charles being at that time un|able to &s;et any fleet to &s;ea. The viceroy, without com|municating his intentions either to Bourbon or Pe&s;cara, conducted his pri&s;oner toward Genoa, under pretence of tran&s;porting him by &s;ea to Naples; though &s;oon after they

&s;et &s;ail, he ordered the pilots to &s;teer directly for Spain; but the wind happening to carry them near the French coa&s;t, the unfortunate Monarch had a full pro&s;pect of his own dominions, towards which he ca&s;t many a &s;or|rowful and de&s;iring look. They landed, however, in a few days at Barcelona, and &s;oon after, Francis was lodg|ed, by the Emperor's command, in the Alcazar of Ma|drid, under the care of the vigilant Alarcon, who guard|ed him with as much circum&s;pection as ever <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Bellay, 95. P. Mart. Ep. ult. Guic. l. 16. 323.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A FEW days after Francis's arrival at Madrid, and when he began to be &s;en&s;ible of his having relied with|out foundation on the Emperor's genero&s;ity, Henry VIII. concluded a treaty with the Regent of France, which afforded him &s;ome hope of liberty from another quarter. Henry's extravagant demands had been receiv|ed at Madrid with that neglect which they de&s;erved, and which he probably expected. Charles, intoxicated with pro&s;perity, no longer courted him in that re&s;pectful and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive manner which plea&s;ed his haughty tem|per. Wol&s;ey, no le&s;s haughty than his ma&s;ter, was highly irritated at the Emperor's di&s;continuing his wonted care&s;&s;es and profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip to him. The&s;e &s;light offences, added to the weighty con&s;iderations formerly mentioned, induced Henry to enter into a defen&s;ive al|liance with Loui&s;e, in which all the differences between him and her &s;on were adju&s;ted; at the &s;ame time, he engaged that he would employ his be&s;t offices in order to procure the deliverance of his new ally from a &s;tate of captivity <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Herbert.

<P>WHILE the open defection of &s;uch a powerful confe|derate affected Charles with deep concern, a &s;ecret con|&s;piracy was carrying on in Italy, which threatened him with con&s;equences &s;till more fatal. The re&s;tle&s;s and in|triguing genius of Moron&egrave;, chancellor of Milan, gave ri&s;e to this. His revenge had been amply gratified by the expul&s;ion of the French out of Italy, and his vanity no le&s;s &s;oothed by the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of Sforza, to who&s;e intere&s;t he had attached him&s;elf, in the dutchy of Milan.

court, in granting Sforza the inve&s;titure of his new-acquired territories had long alarmed Moron&egrave;; the&s;e were repeated &s;o often, and with &s;uch apparent artifice, as became a full proof to his &s;u&s;picious mind, that the Emperor intended to &s;trip his ma&s;ter of that rich coun|try which he had conquered in his name. Though Charles, in order to quiet the Pope and the Venetians, no le&s;s jealous of his de&s;igns than Moron&egrave;, gave Sforza, at la&s;t, the inve&s;titure which had been &s;o long de&s;ired; the charter was clogged with &s;o many re&s;ervations, and &s;ubjected him to &s;uch grievous burdens, as rendered the Duke of Milan a dependant on the Emperor, rather than a va&s;&s;al of the empire, and afforded him &s;carce any other &s;ecurity for his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, than the good plea&s;ure of an ambitious &s;uperior. Such an acce&s;&s;ion of power as would have accrued from the addition of the Milane&s;e to the kingdom of Naples, was con&s;idered by Moron&egrave; as fatal to the liberties of Italy no le&s;s than to his own power and importance. Full of this idea, he began to revolve in his mind the po&s;&s;ibility of re&s;cuing Italy from the yoke of foreigners, the darling &s;cheme, as has been already ob&s;erved, of the Italian politicians in that age, and which it was the great object of their ambition to accompli&s;h. If to the glory of having been the chief in&s;trument of driving the French out of Milan, he could add that of delivering Naples from the dominion of the Spaniards, he thought that nothing would be wanting to compleat his fame. His fertile genius &s;oon &s;ugge&s;ted to him a project for that purpo&s;e; a difficult indeed, and daring one, but for that very rea&s;on, more agreeable to his bold and enterprizing temper.</P>
<P>BOURBON and Pe&s;cara were equally enraged at Lan|noy's carrying the French King into Spain without their knowledge. The former, being afraid that the two Monarchs might, in his ab&s;ence, conclude &s;ome treaty in which his intere&s;ts would be entirely &s;acrificed, ha&s;ten|ed to Madrid, in order to guard again&s;t that danger. The latter, on whom the command of the army now devolved, was obliged to remain in Italy; but in every company, he gave vent to his indignation again&s;t the viceroy in expre&s;&s;ions full of rancour and contempt; he accu&s;ed him in a letter to the Emperor of cowardice

in the time of danger, and of in&s;olence after a victory, towards the obtaining of which he had contributed no|thing either by his valour or his conduct; nor did he ab&s;tain from bitter complaints again&s;t the Emperor him&s;elf, who had not di&s;covered, as he imagined, a &s;uf|ficient &s;en&s;e of his merit, nor be&s;towed any adequate re|ward on his &s;ervices. It was on this di&s;gu&s;t of Pe&s;cara, that Moron&egrave; founded his whole &s;y&s;tem. He knew the boundle&s;s ambition of his nature, the va&s;t extent of his abilities in peace as well as war, and the intrepidity of his mind capable alike of undertaking and of executing the mo&s;t de&s;perate de&s;igns. The cantonment of the Spani&s;h troops on the frontier of the Milane&s;e, gave oc|ca&s;ion to many interviews between him and Moron&egrave;, in which the latter took care frequently to turn the con|ver&s;ation to the tran&s;actions &s;ub&s;equent to the battle of Pavia, a &s;ubject upon which the Marquis entered wil|lingly and with pa&s;&s;ion; and Moron&egrave; ob&s;erving his re|&s;entment to be uniform and violent, artfully pointed out and aggravated every circum&s;tance that could in|crea&s;e its fury. He painted in the &s;tronge&s;t colours the Emperor's want of di&s;cernment, as well as of gratitude, in preferring Lannoy to him, and in allowing that pre|&s;umptuous Fleming to di&s;po&s;e of the captive King with|out con&s;ulting the man to who&s;e bravery and wi&s;dom Charles was indebted for the glory of having him in his power. Having warmed him by &s;uch di&s;cour&s;es, he then began to in&s;inuate, that now was the time to be avenged for tho&s;e in&s;ults, and to acquire immortal re|nown as the deliverer of his country from the oppre&s;&s;ion of &s;trangers; that the &s;tates of Italy, weary of the igno|minious and intolerable dominion of Barbarians, were at la&s;t ready to combine in order to vindicate their own independence; that their eyes were fixed on him as the only leader who&s;e genius and good fortune could en&s;ure the happy &s;ucce&s;s of that noble enterprize; that the at|tempt was no le&s;s practicable than glorious, it being in his power &s;o to di&s;per&s;e the Spani&s;h infantry, the only body of the Emperor's troops in Italy, through the vil|lages of the Milane&s;e, that, in one night they might be de&s;troyed by the people, who, having &s;uffered much from their exactions and in&s;olence, would gladly under|take

this &s;ervice; that he might then, without oppo&s;i|tion, take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne of Naples, the eleva|tion de&s;tined for him, and a reward not unworthy the re|&s;torer of liberty to Italy; that the Pope, of whom that kingdom held, and who&s;e predece&s;&s;ors had di&s;po&s;ed of it on many former occa&s;ion, would willingly grant him the right of inve&s;titure; that the Venetians, the Floren|tines, the Duke of Milan, to whom he had communi|cated the &s;cheme, together with the French, would be the guarantees of his right; that the Neapolitans would naturally prefer the government of one of their country|men, whom they loved and admired, to that odious do|minion of &s;trangers, to which they had been &s;o long &s;ub|jected; and that the Emperor, a&s;toni&s;hed at a blow &s;o unexpected, would find that he had neither troops nor money to re&s;i&s;t &s;uch a powerful confederacy <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Guic. xvi. l. 325.

<P>PESCARA, amazed at the boldne&s;s and extent of the &s;cheme, li&s;tened attentively to Moron&egrave;, but with the countenance of a man lo&s;t in profound and anxious thought. On the one hand, the infamy of betraying his Sovereign under whom he bore &s;uch high command, deterred him from the attempt; on the other, the pro|&s;pect of obtaining a crown allured him to venture upon it. After continuing a &s;hort &s;pace in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, the lea&s;t commendable motives, as is u&s;ual after &s;uch delibera|tions, prevailed, and ambition triumphed over honour. In order, however, to through a colour of decency on his conduct, he in&s;i&s;ted that &s;ome learned ca&s;ui&s;ts &s;hould give their opinion, "Whether it was lawful for a &s;ub|ject to take arms again&s;t his immediate Sovereign, in obedience to the Lord Paramount of whom the king|dom it&s;elf was held." Such a re&s;olution of the ca&s;e, as he expected, was &s;oon obtained from the divines and ci|vilians both of Rome and Miland; the negociation went forward; and mea&s;ures &s;eemed to be taking with great &s;pirit for the &s;peedy execution of the de&s;ign.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE Pe&s;cara, either &s;hocked at the treachery of the action which he was going to commit, or de&s;pair|ing

of its &s;ucce&s;s, began to entertain thoughts of aban|doning the engagements he had come under. The in|di&s;po&s;ition of Sforza, who happened at that time to be taken ill of a di&s;temper which was thought mortal, con|firmed this re&s;olution, and determined him to make known the whole con&s;piracy to the Emperor, deeming it more prudent to expect the dutchy of Milan from him as the reward of this di&s;covery, than to aim at a kingdom to be purcha&s;ed by a &s;eries of crimes. This re&s;olution, however, proved the &s;ource of actions &s;carce le&s;s criminal and ignominious. The Emperor, who had already received full information concerning the con&s;piracy from other hands, &s;eemed to be highly plea&s;ed with Pe&s;cara's fidelity, and commanded him to continue his intrigues for &s;ome time with the Pope and Sforza, both that he might di&s;cover their intentions more fully, and be able to convict them of the crime with greater certainty. Pe&s;cara, con&s;cious of guilt, as well as &s;en&s;ible how &s;u&s;picious his long &s;ilence mu&s;t have appeared at Madrid, dur&s;t not decline that di&s;honourable office; and to his eternal di&s;grace, was obliged to act the mean|e&s;t of all parts, that of &s;educing with a purpo&s;e to betray. Con&s;idering the abilities of the per&s;ons with whom he had to deal, the part was &s;carce le&s;s difficult, than ba&s;e; but he acted it with &s;uch addre&s;s, as to deceive even the penetrating eye of Moron&egrave;, who relying with full confidence on his &s;incerity, vi&s;ited him at Novara, in order to put the la&s;t hand to their machinations. Pe&s;|cara received him in an apartment where Antonio de Leyva was placed behind the tape&s;try, that he might overhear and bear witne&s;s to their conver&s;ation; as Mo|ron&egrave; was returning homewards, that officer &s;uddenly ap|peared, and to his a&s;toni&s;hment arre&s;ted him pri&s;oner in the Emperor's name. He was conducted to the ca&s;tle of Pavia; and Pe&s;cara, who had &s;o lately been his ac|complice, had now the a&s;&s;urance to interrogate him as his judge. At the &s;ame time, the Emperor declared Sforza to have forfeited all right to the dutchy of Mi|lan, by his engaging in a con&s;piracy again&s;t the Sove|reign of whom he held; Pe&s;cara, by his command, &s;eized on every place in the Milane&s;e, except the ca&s;tles of Cremona and Milan, which the unfortunate Duke

<P>BUT though this un&s;ucce&s;sful con&s;piracy, in&s;tead of &s;tripping the Emperor of what he already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in Italy, contributed to extend his dominions in that coun|try, it &s;hewed him the nece&s;&s;ity of coming to &s;ome agreement with the French King, unle&s;s he would draw on him&s;elf a confederacy of all Europe, which the pro|gre&s;s of his arms, and his boundle&s;s and undi&s;gui&s;|ed ambition, filled with general alarm. He had not hitherto treated Francis with the genero&s;ity which that monarch expected, and &s;carce with the decency due to his &s;tation. In&s;tead of di&s;playing the &s;entiments be|coming a great Prince, he &s;eems to have acted with the mercenary art of a Cor&s;air, who by the rigorous u&s;age of his pri&s;oners, endeavours to draw from them an high price for their ran&s;om. The captive King was confined in an old ca&s;tle, under a keeper who&s;e formal au&s;terity of manners rendered his vigilance &s;till more di&s;gu&s;tful. He was allowed no exerci&s;e but that of riding on a mule, &s;urrounded with armed guards on hor&s;e-back. Charles, on pretence of its being nece&s;&s;ary to attend the Cortes a&s;&s;embled in Toledo, had gone to re&s;ide in that city, and &s;uffered &s;everal weeks to elap&s;e without vi&s;it|ing Francis, though he &s;olicited an interview with the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive importunity. So many indignities made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on an high-&s;pirited Prince; he began to loo&s;e all reli&s;h for his u&s;ual amu&s;e|ments; his natural gaiety of temper for&s;ook him; and after langui&s;hing for &s;ome time, he was &s;eized with a dangerous fever, during the violence of which he com|plained con&s;tantly of the unexpected and unprincely ri|gour with which he had been treated, often exclaiming, that now the Emperor would have the &s;ati&s;faction of his dying in his hands, without having once deigned to &s;ee his face. The phy&s;icians, at la&s;t, de&s;paired of his life, and informed the Emperor that they &s;aw no hopes of his recovery, unle&s;s he were gratified with regard to that point on which he &s;eemed to be &s;o &s;trongly bent. Charles, &s;olicitous to pre&s;erve a life, with which all his
<PB N="177" REF="011837_0585_0F9D8871AF7E8220">
pro&s;pects of farther advantage from the victory at Pavia mu&s;t have terminated, immediately con&s;ulted his mini|&s;ters concerning the cour&s;e to be taken. In vain did the chancellor Gattinara, the mo&s;t able among them, re|pre&s;ent to him the indecency of his vi&s;iting Francis, if he did not intend to &s;et him at liberty immediately upon equal terms; in vain did he point out the infamy to which he would be expo&s;ed, if motives of avarice or ambition &s;hould prevail on him to give the captive Mo|narch this mark of attention and &s;ympathy, for which humanity and genero&s;ity had pleaded &s;o long without effect. The Emperor, le&s;s delicate, or le&s;s &s;olicitous about reputation than his mini&s;ter, &s;et out for Madrid to vi&s;it his pri&s;oner. The interview was &s;hort; Francis being too weak to bear a long conver&s;ation. Charles acco&s;ted him in terms full of affection and re&s;pect, and gave him &s;uch promi&s;es of &s;peedy deliverance and princely treatment, as would have reflected the greate&s;t honour upon him, if they had flowed from another &s;ource. Francis gra&s;ped at them with the eagerne&s;s na|tural in his &s;ituation; and cheared with this gleam of hope began to revive from that moment, and &s;oon re|covered his wonted health <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Guic. l. 16. 339.

<P>HE had &s;oon the mortification to find, that his con|fidence in the Emperor was not better founded than formerly. Charles returned in&s;tantly to Toledo; all negociations were carried on by his mini&s;ters; and Francis was kept in as &s;trict cu&s;tody as ever. A new indignity, and that very galling, was added to all the&s;e he had already &s;uffered. Bourbon arrived in Spain about this time, Charles, who had &s;o long refu&s;ed to vi&s;it the King, received his rebellious &s;ubject with the mo&s;t &s;tudied re&s;pect. He met him without the gates of Toledo, embraced him with the greate&s;t affection, and placing him on his left hand, conducted him to his apartment. The&s;e marks of honour to him, were &s;o many in&s;ults to the unfortunate Monarch; which he felt in a very &s;en&s;ible manner. It afforded him &s;ome con&s;olation, however, to ob&s;erve that the &s;entiments of the Spaniards differed widely from tho&s;e of their Sove|reign.
<PB N="178" REF="011837_0586_0F9D88726F6DB170">
That generous people dete&s;ted Bourbon's crime; and notwith&s;tanding his great talents and im|portant &s;ervices, they &s;hunned all intercour&s;e with him to &s;uch a degree, that Charles having de&s;ired the Mar|quis de Villena to permit Bourbon to re&s;ide in his pa|lace while the court remained in Toledo, he politely re|plied, "That he could not refu&s;e gratifying the Empe|ror in that reque&s;t;" but added with a Ca&s;tilian dignity of mind, "That he mu&s;t not be &s;urprized if the mo|ment the con&s;table departed, he &s;hould burn to the ground a hou&s;e, which having been polluted by the pre|&s;ence of a traitor, became an unfit habitation for a man of honour <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Guic. l. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vi. 335.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Emperor him&s;elf, neverthele&s;s, &s;eemed to have it much at heart to reward Bourbon's &s;ervices in a &s;ignal manner. But as Bourbon in&s;i&s;ted, in the fir&s;t place, on the accompli&s;hment of his promi&s;e of giving him in mar|riage his &s;i&s;ter Eleanora, Queen Dowager of Portugal, the honour of which alliance had been one of his chief inducements to rebel again&s;t his lawful Sovereign; as Francis, in order to prevent &s;uch a dangerous union, had offered before he left Italy, to marry that Prince&s;s; and as Eleanora di&s;covered an inclination rather to match with a powerful Monarch, than with his exiled &s;ubject; all the&s;e interfering circum&s;tances created great emba|ra&s;&s;ment to Charles, and left him &s;carce any hope of extricating him&s;elf with decency. But the death of Pe&s;|cara, who, at the age of thirty-&s;ix, left behind him the reputation of being one of the greate&s;t generals and able&s;t politicians of that century, happened opportunely at this juncture for his relief. By that event, the com|mand of the army in Italy became vacant, and Charles, always fertile in his re&s;ources, per&s;uaded Bourbon, who was in no condition to di&s;pute his will, to accept the of|fice of general in chief there, together with a grant of the dutchy of Milan forfeited by Sforza, and in return for the&s;e, to relinqui&s;h all hopes of marrying the Queen of Portugal <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Sandov.

<P>THE chief ob&s;tacle that &s;tood in the way of Francis's liberty, was the Emperor's in&s;i&s;ting &s;o peremptorily on
<PB N="179" REF="011837_0587_0F9D88732F6940B8">
the re&s;titution of Burgundy, as a preliminary to that event. Francis declared that he would never con&s;ent to di&s;member his kingdom; and that if even he &s;hould &s;o far forget the duties of a Monarch, as to come to &s;uch a re&s;olution, the fundamental laws of the kingdom would prevent its taking effect. On his part, he was willing to make an ab&s;olute ce&s;&s;ion to the Emperor of all his preten&s;ions in Italy and the Low-Countries; he promi&s;ed to re&s;tore Bourbon all his lands which had been confi&s;cated; he renewed his propo&s;al of marrying the Emperor's &s;i&s;ter, the Queen Dowager of Portugal; and engaging to pay a great &s;um by ran&s;om for his own per&s;on. But all mutual e&s;teem and confidence between the two Monarchs were now entirely lo&s;t; there appeared, on the one hand, a rapacious ambition, labouring to avail it&s;elf of every favourable circum&s;tance; on the other, &s;u&s;picion and re&s;entment, &s;tanding perpetually on their guard; &s;o that the pro&s;pect of bringing their negocia|tions to an i&s;&s;ue, &s;eemed to be far di&s;tant. The Dut|che&s;s of Alencon, the French King's &s;i&s;ter, whom Charles permitted to vi&s;it her brother in his confinement, em|ployed all her addre&s;s, in order to procure his liberty on more rea&s;onable terms: Henry of England interpo&s;ed his good offices to the &s;ame purpo&s;e; but both with &s;o little &s;ucce&s;s, that Francis in de&s;pair, took &s;uddenly the re&s;olution of re&s;igning his crown with all its rights and prerogatives to his &s;on the Dauphin, determining rather to end his days in a pri&s;on, than to purcha&s;e his freedom by conce&s;&s;ions unworthy of a King. The deed for this purpo&s;e he &s;igned with legal formality at Madrid, em|powering his &s;i&s;ter to carry it into France, that it might be regi&s;tered in all the parliaments of the kingdom; and at the &s;ame time, intimating his intention to the Empe|ror, he de&s;ired him to name the place of his confine|ment, and to a&s;&s;ign him a proper number of attendants during the remainder of his days <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">This paper is publi&s;hed in Memoires Hi&s;toriques, &amp;c. par M. l'Abbe Raynal, tom. ii. p. 151.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS re&s;olution of the French King had great ef|fect; Charles began to be &s;en&s;ible, that by pu&s;hing ri|gour to exce&s;s, he might defeat his own mea&s;ures, and
<PB N="180" REF="011837_0588_0F9D8873EFFF4310">
in&s;tead of the va&s;t advantages he hoped to draw from ran&s;oming a powerful Monarch, he might at la&s;t find in his hands a Prince without dominions or revenues. About the &s;ame time, one of the King of Navarre's do|me&s;tics happened by an extraordinary exertion of fide|lity, courage and addre&s;s, to procure his ma&s;ter an op|portunity of e&s;caping from the pri&s;on in which his ma&s;|ter had been confined ever &s;ince the battle of Pavia. This convinced the Emperor, that the mo&s;t vigilant at|tention of his officers might be eluded by the ingenuity or boldne&s;s of Francis, or his attendants, and one un|lucky hour might deprive him of all the advantages which he had been &s;o &s;olicitous to obtain. By the&s;e con&s;i|derations, he was induced to abate &s;omewhat of his former demands. On the other hand, Francis's impatience un|der confinement daily increa&s;ed; and having received certain intelligence of a powerful league forming again&s;t his rival in Italy, he grew more compliant with regard to conce&s;&s;ions, tru&s;ting, that if he could once obtain his liberty, he would &s;oon be in a condition to re&s;ume what|ever he had yielded.</P>
<P>AS the&s;e were the views and &s;entiments of the two Monarchs, the treaty which procured Francis his liber|ty was &s;igned at Madrid on the fourteenth of January, one thou&s;and five hundred and twenty-&s;ix. The article with regard to Burgundy, which had hitherto created the greate&s;t difficulty, was compromi&s;ed, Francis en|gaging to re&s;tore that dutchy with all its dependencies in full &s;overeignty to the Emperor; and Charles con&s;ent|ing that this re&s;titution &s;hould not be made till the King was &s;et at liberty; in order to &s;ecure the performance of this, as well as the other conditions in the treaty, Francis agreed that at the &s;ame in&s;tant he him&s;elf was relea&s;ed, he would deliver as ho&s;tages to the Emperor, his elde&s;t &s;on the Dauphin, his &s;econd &s;on the Duke of Orleans, or in lieu of the latter, twelve of his principal nobility, to be named by Charles. The other articles &s;welled to a great number, and though not of &s;uch im|portance, were extremely rigorous. Among the&s;e the mo&s;t remarkable were, that Francis &s;hould renounce all his preten&s;ions in Italy; that he &s;hould di&s;claim any title which he had to the &s;overeignty of Flanders and
<PB N="181" REF="011837_0589_0F9D8874AFC13840">
Artois; that within &s;ix weeks after his relea&s;e, he &s;hould re&s;tore to Bourbon and his adherents, all their goods, moveable and immoveable, and make them full repara|tion for the damages they had &s;u&s;tained by the confi&s;|cation of them; that he &s;hould u&s;e his intere&s;t with Henry D'Albret to relinqui&s;h his preten&s;ions to the crown of Navarre, and &s;hould not for the future a&s;&s;i&s;t him in any attempt to recover it; that there &s;hould be e&s;tab|li&s;hed between the Emperor and Francis a league of per|petual friend&s;hip and con&s;ederacy, with a promi&s;e of mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance in every ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity. That in corroboration of this union, Francis &s;hould marry the Emperor's &s;i&s;ter, the Queen Dowager of Portugal; that Francis &s;hould cau&s;e all the articles of this treaty to be ratified by the &s;tates, and regi&s;tered in the parliaments of his kingdom; that upon the Emperor's receiving this ratification, the ho&s;tages &s;hould be &s;et at liberty; but in their place, the Duke of Angouleme, the King's third &s;on, &s;hould be delivered to Charles, that in order to manife&s;t, as well as to &s;trengthen the amity between the two Monarchs, he might be educated at the Impe|rial court; and that if Francis did not, within the time limited, fulfil the &s;tipulations in the treaty, he &s;hould promi&s;e, upon his honour and oath, to return into Spain, and to &s;urrender him&s;elf again a pri&s;oner to the Empe|ror <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Recueil des Trait. tom. ii. 112. Ulloa Vita dell Carlo V. p. 102, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BY this treaty, Charles flattered him&s;elf that he had not only effectually humbled his rival, but that he had taken &s;uch precautions as would for ever prevent his re|attaining any formidable degree of power. The opi|nion, which the wi&s;e&s;t politicians formed concerning it, was very different; they could not per&s;uade them&s;elves that Francis, after obtaining his liberty, would execute the&s;e articles again&s;t which he had &s;truggled &s;o long, and to which even amid&s;t the horrors of captivity he had con&s;ented with &s;uch reluctance. Ambition and re|&s;entment, they knew, would con&s;pire in prompting him to violate the hard conditions to which he had been con&s;trained to &s;ubmit; nor would arguments and ca&s;u|i&s;try be wanting to repre&s;ent that which was &s;o manife&s;tly

advantageous, to be nece&s;&s;ary and ju&s;t. If one part of Francis's conduct had been known, at that time, this opinion might have been founded, not in conjecture, but in certainty. A few hours before he &s;igned the treaty, he a&s;&s;embled &s;uch of his coun&s;ellors as were then in Ma|drid, and having exacted from them a &s;olemn oath of &s;ecrecy, he made a long enumeration in their pre&s;ence of all the di&s;honourable arts, as well as unprincely rigour, which the Emperor had employed in order to en&s;nare or intimidate him. For that rea&s;on, he took a formal pro|te&s;t in the hands of notaries, that his con&s;ent to the treaty &s;hould be con&s;idered as an involuntary deed, and be deemed null and void <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Recueil des Trait. tom. ii. p. 107.</NOTE>. By this di&s;ingenuous arti|fice, for which even the treatment he had received was no apology, Francis endeavoured to &s;atisfy his ho|nour and con&s;cience in &s;igning the treaty, and providing at the &s;ame time a pretext on which to break it.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, great were the outward demon&s;trations of love and confidence between the two Monarchs; they appeared often together in publick; they fre|quently had long conferences in private; they travelled in the &s;ame litter, and joined in the &s;ame amu&s;ements. But amid&s;t the&s;e &s;igns of peace and friend&s;hip, the Em|peror &s;till harboured &s;u&s;picion in his mind. Though the ceremonies of the marriage between Francis and the Queen of Portugal were performed &s;oon after the con|clu&s;ion of the treaty, Charles would not permit him to con&s;ummate it until the return of the ratification from France. Even then Francis was not allowed to be at full liberty; his guards were &s;till continued; and while he was care&s;&s;ed as a brother-in-law, he was &s;till watched like a pri&s;oner; and it was obvious to attentive ob&s;ervers, that an union, in the very beginning of which, there might be di&s;cerned &s;uch &s;ymptoms of jealou&s;y and di&s;|tru&s;t, could not be cordial, or of long continuance <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Guic. l. 16. 353.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ABOUT a month after the &s;igning of the treaty, the Regent's ratification of it was brought from France; and that wi&s;e Prince&s;s, preferring, on this occa&s;ion, the publick good to dome&s;tic affection, informed her &s;on,

At la&s;t Francis took leave of the Emperor, who&s;e &s;u&s;picion of the King's &s;incerity increa&s;ing, as the time of putting it to the proof approached, he endeavoured to bind him &s;till fa&s;ter by exacting new promi&s;es, which after tho&s;e he had already made, the French Monarch was not &s;low to grant. He &s;et out from Madrid, a place which the re|membrance of many afflicting circum&s;tances rendered peculiarly odious to him, with the joy natural on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, and began the long-wi&s;hed-for journey towards his own dominions. He was e&s;corted by a body of hor&s;e under the command of Alarcon, who, as the King drew near the frontiers of France, guarded him with more &s;crupulous exactne&s;s than ever. When he arrived at the river Andaye, which &s;eparates the two kingdoms, Lautrec appeared on the oppo&s;ite bank with a guard of hor&s;e equal in number to Alarcon's. An empty bark was moored in the middle of the &s;tream; the attendants drew up in order on the oppo&s;ite banks; at the &s;ame in&s;tant, Lannoy with eight gentlemen put off from the Spani&s;h, and Lautrec with the &s;ame number from the French &s;ide of the river; the former had the King in his boat; the latter, the Dauphin and Duke of Orleans; they met in the empty ve&s;&s;el; the exchange was made in a moment; Francis, after a &s;hort embrace to his children leaped into Lautrec's boat, and reached the French &s;hore. He mounted that in&s;tant a Turki&s;h hor&s;e, waved his hand over his head, and with a joyful voice crying aloud &s;everal times, "I am yet a King," gal|loped full &s;peed to St. John de Luz, and from thence to Bayonne.

<P><PB N="184" REF="011837_0592_0F9D8876F04F10C0">SOON after the Emperor had taken leave of Francis, and permitted him to begin his journey towards his own dominions, he &s;et out for Seville, in order to &s;olemnize his marriage with I&s;abella, the daughter of Emanuel, the late King of Portugal, and the &s;i&s;ter of John III. who had &s;ucceeded him in the throne of that kingdom. I&s;abella was a Prince&s;s of uncommon beauty and accom|pli&s;hments; and as the Cortes both in Ca&s;tile and Ara|gon had warmly &s;olicited their Sovereign to marry, the choice of a wife &s;o nearly allied to the royal blood of both kingdoms, was extremely acceptable to his &s;ub|jects.

<P>DURING the&s;e tran&s;actions, Charles could &s;carce give any attention to the affairs of Germany, though it was torn in pieces by commotions, which threatened the mo&s;t dangerous con&s;equences. The feudal in&s;titutions &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted almo&s;t unimpaired in the empire. The property of lands was ve&s;ted in the Princes, and free-barons. Their va&s;&s;als held of them by the &s;tricte&s;t and mo&s;t limited tenures; while the great body of the peo|ple was kept in a &s;tate but little removed from ab&s;olute &s;ervitude. In &s;ome places of Germany, people of the lowe&s;t cla&s;s were &s;o entirely in the power of their ma&s;|ters, as to be &s;ubject to per&s;onal and dome&s;tic &s;lavery, the mo&s;t rigorous form of that wretched &s;tate. In other provinces, particularly in Bohemia and Lu&s;atia, the pea|&s;ants were bound to remain on the lands to which they belonged, and making part of the e&s;tate, were transfer|red like any other property, from one hand to another. Even in Suabia, and the other countries on the banks of

the Rhine, where their condition was mo&s;t tolerable, the pea&s;ants not only paid the full rent of their farms to the landlord; but if they cho&s;e either to change the place of their abode, or to follow a new profe&s;&s;ion, they were obliged to purcha&s;e this privilege at a certain price. Be|&s;ides this, all grants of lands to pea&s;ants expired at their death, without de&s;cending to their po&s;terity. Upon that event, the landlord had a right to the be&s;t of their cattle, and of their furniture; and their heirs, in order to ob|tain a renewal of the grant, were obliged to pay large &s;ums by way of fine. The&s;e exactions, though grievous, were borne with patience, becau&s;e they were cu&s;tomary and antient: But when the progre&s;s of elegance and luxury, as well as the changes introduced into the art of war came to increa&s;e the expence of government, and made it nece&s;&s;ary for Princes to levy occa&s;ional or &s;tated taxes on their &s;ubjects, &s;uch impo&s;itions being new, ap|peared intolerable; and in Germany, the&s;e duties being laid chiefly upon beer, wine, and other nece&s;&s;aries of life, affected the common people in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible manner.

It was to the valour in&s;pired by re&s;entment again&s;t impo&s;itions of this kind, that the Swi&s;s owed the acqui&s;ition of their liberty in the four|teenth century. The &s;ame cau&s;e had excited the pea|&s;ants in &s;everal other provinces in Germany to rebel again&s;t their &s;uperiors towards the end of the fifteenth and beginning of the &s;ixteenth centuries; and though the&s;e in&s;urrections were not attended with like &s;ucce&s;s, they could not however be quelled without much diffi|culty and blood&s;hed <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Seckend. lib. ii. p. 2. 6.</NOTE>.</P>

With this view, they drew up and publi&s;hed a memorial, containing all their demands, and declared, that while arms were in their hands, they would either per&s;uade or oblige the nobles to give them full &s;atisfaction with re|gard to the&s;e. The chief articles were, that they might have liberty to chu&s;e their own pa&s;tors; that they might be freed from the payment of all tythes but tho&s;e of corn; that they might no longer be con&s;idered as the &s;laves or bondmen of their &s;uperiors; that the liberty of hunt|ing and fi&s;hing might be common; that the great fore&s;ts might not be regarded as private property, but be open for the u&s;e of all; that they might be delivered from the unu&s;ual burden of taxes under which they laboured; that the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice might be rendered le&s;s rigorous and more impartial; that the encroachments of the nobles upon meadows and commons might be re|&s;trained <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Sleid.

<P>MANY of the&s;e demands were extremely rea&s;onable; and being urged by &s;uch formidable numbers, might have met with &s;ome redre&s;s.

<P>THESE commotions happened at fir&s;t in provinces of Germany, where Luther's opinions had made little pro|gre&s;s; and being excited wholly by political cau&s;es, had no connection with the di&s;puted points in religion. But the frenzy reaching at la&s;t tho&s;e countries in which the Reformation was e&s;tabli&s;hed, derived new &s;trength from circum&s;tances peculiar to them, and ro&s;e to a &s;till greater pitch of extravagance. The Reformation, where|ever it was received, increa&s;ed that bold and innovating &s;pirit to which it owed its birth. Men who had the courage to overturn a &s;y&s;tem &s;upported by every thing which can command re&s;pect or reverence, were not to be overawed by any authority, however great or vene|rable. After having been accu&s;tomed to con&s;ider them|&s;elves as judges of the mo&s;t important doctrines in reli|gion, to examine the&s;e freely, and to reject, without &s;cruple, what appeared to them erroneous, it was natu|ral for them to turn the &s;ame daring and inqui&s;itive eye towards government, and to think of rectifying whatever di&s;orders or imperfections were di&s;covered there. And as religious abu&s;es had been reformed in &s;everal places without the permi&s;&s;ion of the magi&s;trate, it was an ea&s;y tran&s;ition to attempt the redre&s;s of political grievances in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>NO &s;ooner, then, did the &s;pirit of revolt break out in Thuringia, a province &s;ubject to the Elector of Saxony, the inhabitants of which were mo&s;tly converts to Luthe|rani&s;m, than it a&s;&s;umed a new and more dangerous form. Thomas Muncer, one of Luther's di&s;ciples hav|ing e&s;tabli&s;hed him&s;elf in that country, had acquired a wonderful a&s;cendant over the minds of the people. He propagated among them the wilde&s;t and mo&s;t enthu&s;i|a&s;tic notions, but &s;uch as tended manife&s;tly to in&s;pire them with boldne&s;s, and lead them to &s;edition.

<P>EXTRAVAGANT as the&s;e tenets were, they flattered &s;o many pa&s;&s;ions in the human heart, as to make a deep impre&s;&s;ion. To aim at nothing more than abridging the power of the nobles was now con&s;idered as a trifling and partial reformation, not worth the contending for; it was propo&s;ed to level every di&s;tinction among mankind, and by aboli&s;hing property, to reduce them to their na|tural &s;tate of equality, in which all &s;hould receive their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from one common &s;tock.

with the appellation given to people in the lowe&s;t cla&s;s of life. Va&s;t numbers engaged in this wild under|taking; but Muncer, their leader and their prophet, was de&s;titute of the abilities nece&s;&s;ary for conducting it. He had all the extravagance, but not the courage, which enthu&s;ia&s;ts u&s;ually po&s;&s;e&s;s. It was with difficulty he could be per&s;uaded to take the field; and though he &s;oon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> together eight thou&s;and men, he &s;uffered him|&s;elf to be &s;urrounded by a body of cavalry under the command of the Elector of Saxony, the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e, and Duke of Brun&s;wick. The&s;e Princes, unwil|ling to &s;hed the blood of their deluded &s;ubjects, &s;ent a young nobleman to their camp, with the offer of a ge|neral pardon, if they would immediately lay down their arms, and deliver up the authors of the &s;edition. Mun|cer, alarmed at this, began to harangue them with his u&s;ual vehemence, exhorting them not to tru&s;t the&s;e de|ceitful promi&s;es of their oppre&s;&s;ors, nor to de&s;ert the cau&s;e of God, and of Chri&s;tian liberty.</P>
<P>BUT the &s;en&s;e of pre&s;ent danger made a deeper im|pre&s;&s;ion on the pea&s;ants than his eloquence, and confu|&s;ion and terror were vi&s;ible in every face, when a rain|bow, which was the emblem the mutineers had painted on their colours, happening to appear in the clouds, Muncer, with admirable pre&s;ence of mind, laid hold of that incident, and &s;uddenly rai&s;ed his eyes and hands towards heaven, "Behold," cries he, with an elevated voice, "the &s;ign which God has given. There is the pledge of your &s;afety, and a token that the wicked &s;hall be de&s;troyed." The fanatical multitude &s;et up in&s;tant|ly a great &s;hout, as if victory had been certain; and pa&s;|&s;ing in a moment from one extreme to another, murder|ed the unfortunate nobleman who had come with the offer of pardon, and demanded to be led towards the enemy. The Princes enraged at this &s;hocking viola|tion of the laws of war, prevented them by beginning the attack; but the behaviour of the pea&s;ants in the combat was not &s;uch as might have been expected either from their ferocity or confidence of &s;ucce&s;s; an undi&s;|ciplined rabble was no equal match for well-trained troops; above five thou&s;and were &s;lain in the field, al|mo&s;t without making re&s;i&s;tance; the re&s;t fled, and

Among the&s;e the Teutonic order in Germany was one of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious, the knights of which di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves greatly in all the wild enterprizes carried on in the Holy Land. Being driven at la&s;t from their &s;ettle|ments in the ea&s;t, they were obliged to return to their native country. Their zeal and valour, were too impe|tuous to remain long inactive. They invaded, on very &s;light pretences, the province of Pru&s;&s;ia, the inhabitants of which were &s;till idolaters; and having completed the conque&s;t of it about the middle of the thirteenth centu|ry, held it many years as a fief depending on the crown of Poland.

Albert, a Prince of the hou&s;e or Bran|denburgh, who was elected grand-ma&s;ter in the year one thou&s;and five hundred and eleven, engaging keenly in this quarrel, maintained a long war with Sigi&s;mund, King of Poland; but having become an early convert to Luther's doctrines, this gradually le&s;&s;ened his zeal for the intere&s;ts of his fraternity, &s;o that he took the op|portunity of the confu&s;ions in the empire, and the ab|&s;ence of the Emperor, to conclude a treaty with Sigi&s;|mund, greatly to his private emolument. By it, that part of Pru&s;&s;ia which belonged to the Teutonic order, was erected into a &s;ecular and hereditary dutchy, and the inve&s;titure of it granted to Albert, who, in return, bound him&s;elf to do homage for it to the Kings of Po|land as their va&s;&s;al.

<P>UPON the return of the French King to his domi|nions, the eyes of all the powers in Europe were fixed upon him, that by ob&s;erving his fir&s;t motions, they might form a judgment concerning his &s;ub&s;equent conduct. They were not held long in &s;u&s;pence. Fran|cis, as &s;oon as he arrived at Bayonne, wrote to the King of England, thanking him for his zealous and affection|ate interpo&s;ition in his favour, to which he acknow|ledged that he owed the recovery of his liberty. Next day the Emperor's amba&s;&s;adors demanded audience, and in their ma&s;ter's name, required him to i&s;&s;ue &s;uch or|ders as were nece&s;&s;ary for carrying the treaty of Madrid into full and immediate execution; he coldly an&s;wered, That though for his own part he determined religiou&s;ly to perform all he had promi&s;ed, the treaty contained &s;o many articles relative not to him&s;elf alone, but affect|ing the intere&s;ts of the French monarchy, that he could not take any farther &s;tep without con&s;ulting the &s;tates of his kingdom, and that &s;ome time would be nece&s;&s;a|ry in order to reconcile their minds to the hard condi|tions which he had con&s;ented to ratify <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Bellay, p 97.</NOTE>. This reply was con&s;idered as no ob&s;cure di&s;covery of his being re|&s;olved to elude the treaty; and the compliment paid to Henry, appeared a very proper &s;tep towards &s;ecuring the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of that Monarch in the war with the Em|peror, to which &s;uch a re&s;olution would certainly give ri&s;e. The&s;e circum&s;tances, added to the explicit decla|rations which Francis made in &s;ecret to the amba&s;&s;adors from &s;everal of the Italian powers, fully &s;atisfied them that their conjectures with regard to his conduct had been ju&s;t, and that in&s;tead of intending to execute an unrea&s;onable treaty, he was eager to &s;eize the fir&s;t op|portunity of revenging tho&s;e injuries which had com|pelled

That feeble Prince, deprived now of Moron&egrave;'s advice, and unprovided with every thing nece&s;&s;ary for defence, found means to inform Clement and the Venetians that he mu&s;t &s;oon &s;urrender, if they did not come to his re|lief. The Imperial troops, as they had received no pay &s;ince the battle of Pavia, lived at di&s;cretion in the Milane&s;e, levying &s;uch exorbitant contributions in that dutchy, as amounted, if we may rely on Guiccardini's calculation, to no le&s;s a &s;um than five thou&s;and ducats a day <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Guic. l. 17. 360.</NOTE>; nor was it to be doubted, but that the &s;oldiers, as &s;oon as the ca&s;tle &s;hould &s;ubmit, would choo&s;e to leave a ruined country, which &s;carce afforded them &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, that they might take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of more comfortable quarters in the fertile and untouched terri|tories of the Pope and Venetians.

<P>NO &s;ooner was this league concluded, than Clement, by the plenitude of his papal power, ab&s;olved Francis from the oath he had taken to ob&s;erve the treaty of Ma|drid<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Golda&s;t.

This right, how pernicious &s;oever to morals, and de&s;tructive of that integrity which is the ba&s;is of all tran&s;actions among&s;t men, was the natural con&s;equence of the powers which the Popes arrogated as infallible vicegerents of Chri&s;t upon earth; and they having, in virtue of the&s;e, often di&s;pen&s;ed with obligations which were held &s;acred, the intere&s;t of &s;ome men, and the cre|dulity of others, led them to imagine, that the deci&s;ions of a &s;overeign Pontiff authorized or ju&s;tified actions which would, otherwi&s;e, have been criminal and un|becoming.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, the di&s;covery of Francis's intention to elude the treaty of Madrid, filled the Emperor with a variety of di&s;quieting thoughts. He had treated an unfortunate Prince with the mo&s;t ungenerous rigour; he had di&s;played an in&s;atiable ambition in all his nego|ciations with his pri&s;oner: He knew what cen&s;ures the former had drawn upon him, and what apprehen&s;ions the latter had excited in every court of Europe; nor had he reaped from the mea&s;ures he pur&s;ued, any of tho&s;e advantages which politicians are apt to con&s;ider as an excu&s;e for the mo&s;t criminal conduct, and a compen|&s;ation for the &s;evere&s;t reproaches. Francis was now out of his hands, and not one of all the mighty con&s;equen|ces which he expected from the treaty that &s;et him at

liberty, was likely to take place. His ra&s;hne&s;s in rely|ing &s;o far on his own judgment as to tru&s;t to the &s;ince|rity of the French King, in oppo&s;ition to the &s;entiments of his wi&s;e&s;t mini&s;ters, was now apparent; and he ea&s;i|ly conjectured, that the &s;ame confederacy, the dre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of which had induced him to &s;et Francis at liberty, would now be formed again&s;t him with that gallant and in|cen&s;ed Monarch at its head. Self-condemnation and &s;hame, on account of what was pa&s;t, with anxious ap|prehen&s;ions concerning what might happen, were the nece&s;&s;ary re&s;ult of the&s;e reflections on his own conduct and &s;ituation. Charles, however, was naturally firm and inflexible in all his mea&s;ures. To have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eceded &s;uddenly from any article in the treaty of Madrid, would have been a plain confe&s;&s;ion of imprudence, and a pal|pable &s;ymptom of fear; he determined therefore, that it was mo&s;t &s;uitable to his dignity, to in&s;i&s;t, whatever might be the con&s;equences, on the &s;trict execution of the treaty, and particularly not to accept of any thing which might be offered as an equivalent for the re&s;titu|tion of Burgundy <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Guic. l xvii. 366.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN con&s;equence of this re&s;olution, he appointed Lan|noy and Alarcon, to repair, as his amba&s;&s;adors to the court of France, and formally to &s;ummon the King ei|ther to execute the treaty with the &s;incerity that became him, or to return, according to his oath, a pri&s;oner to Madrid. In&s;tead of giving them an immediate an&s;wer, Francis admitted the deputies of the &s;tates of Burgundy to an audience in their pre&s;ence. They humbly repre|&s;ented to him, that he had exceeded the powers ve&s;ted in a King of France when he con&s;ented to alienate their country from the crown, the domains of which he was bound by his coronation oath to pre&s;erve entire and un|impaired. Francis, in return, thanked them for their attachment to his crown, and intreated them, though very faintly, to remember the obligations which he lay under to fulfil his engagements with the Emperor. The deputies a&s;&s;uming an higher tone, declared they would not obey commands which they con&s;idered as illegal; and if he &s;hould abandon them to the enemies of France,
<PB N="196" REF="011837_0604_0F9D887FF1AA2068">
they had re&s;olved to defend them&s;elves to the be&s;t of their power, with a firm purpo&s;e rather to peri&s;h than to &s;ubmit to a foreign dominion. Upon which Francis turning towards the Imperial amba&s;&s;adors, re|pre&s;ented to them the impo&s;&s;ibility of performing what he had undertaken, and offered in lieu of Bur|gundy, to pay the Emperor two millions of crowns. The viceroy and Alarcon, who ea&s;ily perceived that the &s;cene to which they had been witne&s;&s;es, was con|certed between the King and his &s;ubjects in order to impo&s;e on them, &s;ignified to him their ma&s;ter's fixed re&s;olution not to depart in the &s;malle&s;t point from the terms of the treaty, and withdrew <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Belcar. Comment. de Reb. Gal. 573. Mem. de Bellay, 97.</NOTE>. Before they left the kingdom, they had the mortification to hear the holy league again&s;t the Emperor publi&s;hed with great &s;olemnity.</P>
<P>CHARLES no &s;ooner received an account of this con|federacy than he exclaimed in the mo&s;t publick manner, and in the har&s;he&s;t terms, again&s;t Francis, as a Prince void of faith, or of honour. He complained no le&s;s of Clement, whom he &s;olicited in vain to abandon his new allies; he accu&s;ed him of ingratitude; he taxed him with an ambition unbecoming his character; he threatened him not only with all the vengeance which the power of an Emperor can inflict, but by appealing to a general council, called up before him all the ter|rors ari&s;ing from the authority of tho&s;e a&s;&s;emblies &s;o formidable to the papal &s;ee. It was nece&s;&s;ary, however, to oppo&s;e &s;omething el&s;e than reproaches and threats to the powerful combination formed again&s;t him; and the Emperor, prompted by &s;o many pa&s;&s;ions, did not fail to exert him&s;elf with unu&s;ual vigour, in order to &s;end &s;upplies not only of men, but of money, which was &s;till more needed, into Italy.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, the efforts of the confederates bore no proportion to that animo&s;ity again&s;t the Empe|ror with which they &s;eemed to enter into the holy league. Francis, it was thought, would have infu&s;ed &s;pirit and vigour into the whole body. He had his lo&s;t honour to

repair, many injuries to revenge, and the &s;tation among the Princes of Europe, from which he had fallen, to re|cover. From all the&s;e, added to the natural impetuo|&s;ity of his temper, a war more fierce and bloody than any he had hitherto made upon his rival, was expected. But Francis had gone through &s;uch a &s;cene of di&s;tre&s;s, and the impre&s;&s;ion it had made was &s;till &s;o fre&s;h in his me|mory, that he was become diffident of him&s;elf, di&s;tru&s;tful of fortune, and de&s;irous of tranquillity. To procure the relea&s;e of his &s;ons, and to avoid the re&s;titution of Burgundy by paying &s;ome rea&s;onable equivalent, were his chief ob|jects, and for the &s;ake of the&s;e, he would willingly have &s;acrificed Sforza and the liberties of Italy to the Empe|ror. He flattered him&s;elf, that the dread alone of &s;uch a confederacy would induce Charles to li&s;ten to what was equitable; and was afraid of employing any con&s;ider|able force for the relief of the Milane&s;e, left his allies, whom he had often found to be more attentive to their own intere&s;t, than punctual in fulfilling their engage|ments, &s;hould abandon him as &s;oon as the Imperiali&s;ts were driven out of that country, and deprive his nego|tiations with the Emperor of that weight which they de|rived from his being at the head of a powerful league. Meanwhile, the ca&s;tle of Milan was pre&s;&s;ed more clo&s;ely than ever, and Sforza was now reduced to the la&s;t extre|mity. The Pope and Venetians, tru&s;ting to Francis's concurrence, commanded their troops to take the field, in order to relieve him; and an army more than &s;uffi|cient for that &s;ervice was &s;oon formed. The Milane&s;e, pa&s;&s;ionately attached to their unfortunate Duke, and no le&s;s exa&s;perated again&s;t the Imperiali&s;ts, who had oppre&s;|&s;ed them &s;o cruelly, were ready to aid the confederates in all their enterprizes. But the Duke d'Urbino, their general, naturally &s;low and indeci&s;ive, and re&s;trained, be|&s;ides, by his antient enmity to the family of Medici, from taking any &s;tep that might aggrandize or add re|putation to the Pope <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Guic. l. 17. 382.</NOTE>, lo&s;t &s;ome opportunities, and re|fu&s;ed to improve others, of attacking the Imperiali&s;ts, and rai&s;ing the &s;iege.

to bring up a reinforcement of fre&s;h troops, and a &s;upply of money. He immediately took the command of the army, and pu&s;hed on the &s;iege with &s;uch vigour, as quickly obliged Sforza to &s;urrender, who retiring to Lodi, which the confederates had &s;urprized, left Bour|bon in fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the re&s;t of the dutchy, the in|ve&s;titure of which the Emperor had promi&s;ed to grant him <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Guic. l. 17. 376, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Italians began now to perceive the game which Francis had played, and to be &s;en&s;ible, that, notwith|&s;tanding all their addre&s;s, and refinements in negocia|tion, which they boa&s;ted of as talents peculiarly their own, they had for once been over-reached in tho&s;e very arts by a <HI>tramontane</HI> Prince. He had hitherto thrown almo&s;t the whole burden of the war upon them, taking advantage of their efforts, in order to enforce the propo|&s;als which he often renewed at the court of Madrid for obtaining the liberty of his &s;ons. The Pope and Vene|tians expo&s;tulated and complained <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;celli Le&s;tere de Principi ii. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">7, &amp;c. 159, 160&mdash;166.</NOTE>, but as they were not able to rouze Francis from his inactivity, their own zeal and vigour gradually abated, and Clement having already gone farther than his timidity u&s;ually permitted him, began to accu&s;e him&s;elf of ra&s;hne&s;s, and to relap&s;e into his natural &s;tate of doubt and uncertainty.</P>
<P>ALL the Emperor's motions depending on him&s;elf alone, were more bri&s;k and better concerted. The nar|rowne&s;s of his revenues, indeed, did not allow him to make any &s;udden or great effort in the field, but he abundantly &s;upplied that defect by his intrigues and ne|gociations. The family of Colonna, the mo&s;t powerful of all the Roman barons, had adhered uniformly to the Ghibeline or Imperial faction, during the&s;e fierce con|tentions between the Popes and Emperors, which for &s;everal ages, filled Italy and Germany with di&s;cord and blood&s;hed. Though the cau&s;es which at fir&s;t gave birth to the&s;e de&s;tructive factions exi&s;ted no longer, and the rage with which they had been animated was in a great mea&s;ure &s;pent, the Colonnas &s;till retained their attach|ment to the Imperial intere&s;t, and by placing them&s;elves

under the protection of the Emperors, &s;ecured the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their own territories and privileges. The Cardinal Pompeo Colonna, a man of a turbulent and ambitious temper, at that time the head of the family, had long been Clement's rival, to who&s;e influence in the la&s;t conclave he imputed the di&s;appointment of all his &s;chemes for attaining the papal dignity, of which, from his known connection with the Emperor, he thought him&s;elf &s;ecure. This was too great an injury to an a&s;piring mind ever to be forgiven; and though he had di&s;&s;embled his re&s;entment &s;o far as to vote for Clement at his election, and to accept of great offices in his court, he waited with the utmo&s;t impatience for an opportunity of being revenged. Don Hugo di Moncada, the Imperial amba&s;&s;ador at Rome, who was no &s;tranger to the&s;e &s;en|timents, ea&s;ily per&s;uaded him that now was the time, while all the papal troops were employed in Lombardy, to attempt &s;omething which would, at once, avenge his own wrongs, and be of e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to the Emperor his patron. The Pope, however, who&s;e timidity ren|dered him quick-&s;ighted, was &s;o attentive to their ope|rations, and began to be alarmed &s;o early, that he might have drawn together troops &s;ufficient to have di&s;con|certed all Colonna's mea&s;ures. But Moncada amu&s;ed him &s;o artfully with negociations, promi&s;es, and fal&s;e in|telligence, that he lulled a&s;leep all his &s;u&s;picions, and prevented his taking any of the precautions nece&s;&s;ary for his &s;afety; and, to the eternal di&s;grace of a Prince po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great power, as well as renowned for politi|cal wi&s;dom, Colonna at the head of three thou&s;and men, &s;eized one of the gates of his capital, while he imagined him&s;elf to be in perfect &s;ecurity, and was altogether un|prepared for re&s;i&s;ting &s;uch a feeble enemy. The inhabi|tants of Rome permitted Colonna's troops, from whom they apprehended no injury, to advance without oppo|&s;ition; the Pope's guards were di&s;per&s;ed in a moment; and Clement him&s;elf terrified at the danger, a&s;hamed of his own credulity and de&s;erted by almo&s;t every per&s;on, fled with precipitation into the ca&s;tle of St. Angelo, which was immediately inve&s;ted. The palace of the Vatican, the church of St. Peter, and the hou&s;es of the Pope's mini&s;ters and &s;ervants, were plundered in the mo&s;t

licentious manner; the re&s;t of the city was left unmo|le&s;ted. Clement, de&s;titute of every thing nece&s;&s;ary ei|ther for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence or defence, was &s;oon obliged to de|mand a capitulation: and Moncada being admitted into the ca&s;tle, pre&s;cribed to him with all the haughtine&s;s of a conqueror, conditions which it was not in his power to reject. The chief of the&s;e was, That Clement &s;hould not only grant a full pardon to the Colonnas, but re|ceive them into favour, and immediately withdraw all the troops in his pay from the army of the confederates in Lombardy <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Jovii Vita Pomp.

<P>THE Colonnas, who talked of nothing le&s;s than of de|po&s;ing Clement, and of placing Pompeo, their kin&s;man, in the vacant chair of St. Peter, exclaimed loudly again&s;t a treaty which left them at the mercy of a Pon|tiff ju&s;tly incen&s;ed again&s;t them. But Moncada, atten|tive only to his ma&s;ter's intere&s;t, paid little regard to their complaints, and by this fortunate mea&s;ure, broke en|tirely the power of the confederates.</P>
<P>WHILE the army of the confederates &s;uffered &s;uch a con&s;iderable diminution, the Imperiali&s;ts received two great reinforcements; one from Spain, under the com|mand of Lannoy and Alarcon, which amounted to &s;ix thou&s;and men. The other was rai&s;ed in the empire by George Frond&s;perg, a German nobleman, who having &s;erved in Italy with great reputation, had acquired &s;uch influence and popularity, that multitudes of his country|men, fond on every occa&s;ion of engaging in military en|terprizes, and impatient at that juncture to e&s;cape from the oppre&s;&s;ion of their &s;uperiors both in religious and civil matters, crouded to his &s;tandard; &s;o that without any other gratuity than the payment of a crown to each man, fourteen thou&s;and enli&s;ted in his &s;ervice.

Bourbon, in particular, was involved in &s;uch difficulties, that he &s;tood in need of all his addre&s;s and courage in order to extricate him&s;elf. Va&s;t &s;ums were due to the Spani&s;h troops already in the Milane&s;e, when Frond&s;perg arrived with &s;ixteen thou|&s;and hungry Germans, de&s;titute of every thing. Both made their demands with equal fiercene&s;s; the former claiming their arrears, and the latter the pay which had been promi&s;ed them on their entering Lombardy: Bour|bon was altogether incapable of giving &s;atisfaction to either. In this &s;ituation, he was con&s;trained to commit acts of violence extremely &s;hocking to his own nature, which was gentle and humane. He &s;eized the principal citizens of Milan, and by threats, and even torture, forced from them a con&s;iderable &s;um; he rifled the churches of all their plate and ornaments; the inade|quate &s;upply which the&s;e afforded, he di&s;tributed among the &s;oldiers, with &s;o many &s;oothing expre&s;&s;ions of his &s;ympathy and affection, that, though it fell far &s;hort of the &s;ums due to them, it appea&s;ed their pre&s;ent mur|murs <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ripamont.

<P>SUCH, indeed, were the exigencies of the Imperial troops in the Milane&s;e, that it became indi&s;pen&s;ably ne|ce&s;&s;ary to take &s;ome immediate &s;tep for their relief. The arrears of the &s;oldiers increa&s;ed daily; the Emperor made no remittances to his generals; and the utmo&s;t rigour of military extortion could draw nothing more from a country entirely drained and ruined. In this &s;i|tuation there was no choice left, but either to di&s;band the army, or to march for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence into the enemy's country. The territories of the Venetians lay neare&s;t at hand; but they, with their u&s;ual fore&s;ight and pru|dence, had taken &s;uch precautions as &s;ecured them from any in&s;ult. Nothing therefore remained, but to invade the dominions of the church, or of the Florentines; and Clement had of late acted &s;uch a part, as merited the &s;evere&s;t vengeance from the Emperor. No &s;ooner did the troops return to Rome after the in&s;urrection of the Colonnas, than, without paying any regard to the treaty with Moncada, he degraded the Cardinal Colonna, ex|communicated the re&s;t of the family, &s;eized their places of &s;trength, and wa&s;ted their lands with all the cruelty which the &s;mart of a recent injury naturally excites. After this, he turned his arms again&s;t Naples, and as his operations were &s;econded by the French fleet, he made &s;ome progre&s;s towards the conque&s;t of that king|dom; the viceroy being no le&s;s de&s;titute than the other Imperial generals, of the money requi&s;ite for a vigorous defence <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Jovii Vita Pomp.

<P>THESE proceedings of the Pope, ju&s;tified in appear|ance, the mea&s;ures which Bourbon's &s;ituation rendered nece&s;&s;ary; and he &s;et about executing them under &s;uch di&s;advantages, as furni&s;h the &s;tronge&s;t proof, both of the

de&s;pair to which he was reduced, and of the greatne&s;s of his abilities which were able to &s;urmount &s;o many ob|&s;tacles. Having committed the government of Milan to Leyva, whom he was not unwilling to leave behind; he began his march in the depth of winter, at the head of twenty-five thou&s;and men, compo&s;ed of nations dif|fering from each other in language and manners; with|out money, without magazines, without artillery, with|out carriages; in &s;hort, without any of tho&s;e things which are nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;malle&s;t party, and which &s;eem e&s;&s;ential to the exi&s;tence and motions of a great ar|my. His rout lay through a country cut by rivers and mountains, in which the roads were almo&s;t impracti|cable; as an addition to his difficulties, the enemy's army, &s;uperior to his own in number, was at hand to watch all his motions, and to improve every advantage. But his troops, impatient of their pre&s;ent hard&s;hips, and allured by the hopes of obtaining an immen&s;e booty, did not con&s;ider how ill provided they were for a march, and followed him with great chearfulne&s;s. His fir&s;t &s;cheme was to have made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Placentia, and to have gratified his &s;oldiers with the plunder of that city; but the vigilance of the confederate generals ren|dered the de&s;ign abortive; nor had he better &s;ucce&s;s in his project for the reduction of Bologna, which was &s;ea&s;on|ably &s;upplied with as many troops as &s;ecured it from the in&s;ults of an army which had neither artillery nor am|munition. Having failed in both the&s;e attempts to be|come ma&s;ter of &s;ome great city, he was under a nece&s;|&s;ity of advancing. But he had now been two months in the field; his troops had &s;uffered every calamity which a long march, together with the uncommon rigour of the &s;ea&s;on could bring upon men de&s;titute of all nece&s;|&s;ary accommodations, in an enemy's country; the mag|nificent promi&s;es to which they tru&s;ted, had proved al|together vain; they &s;aw no pro&s;pect of relief; their pa|tience, tried to the utmo&s;t, failed at la&s;t, and they broke out into open mutiny. Some officers, who ra&s;hly at|tempted to re&s;train them, fell victims to their fury; Bourbon him&s;elf, not daring to appear during the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of their rage, was obliged to fly &s;ecretly from

his quarters <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Guic. l. 18. 434. Jovii Vit. Colon. 163.</NOTE>. But this &s;udden ebullition of wrath be|gan at la&s;t to &s;ub&s;ide; when Bourbon, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in a wonderful degree, the art of governing the minds of &s;oldiers, renewed his promi&s;es with more confidence than formerly, and a&s;&s;ured them that they would be &s;oon ac|compli&s;hed. He endeavoured to render their hard&s;hips more tolerable by partaking of them him&s;elf; he fared no better than the meane&s;t centinel; he marched along with them on foot; he joined them in &s;inging their camp-ballads, in which, with high prai&s;es of his valour, they mingled many &s;trokes of military raillery on his po|verty; and wherever they came, he allowed them, as a foreta&s;te of what he had promi&s;ed, to plunder the adja|cent villages at di&s;cretion. Encouraged by all the&s;e &s;oothing arts, they entirely forgot their &s;ufferings and complaints, and followed him with the &s;ame implicit confidence as formerly <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Oeuvres de Brant. tom iv. 246, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BOURBON, meanwhile, carefully concealed his inten|tions. Rome and Florence, not knowing on which the blow would fall, were held in the mo&s;t di&s;quieting &s;tate of &s;u&s;pence. Clement, equally &s;olicitous for the &s;afety of both, fluctuated in more than his u&s;ual uncertainty; and while the rapid approach of danger called for prompt and deci&s;ive mea&s;ures, he &s;pent the time in deliberations which came to no i&s;&s;ue, or in taking re&s;olutions, which next day, his re&s;tle&s;s mind, more &s;agacious in di&s;cerning than in obviating difficulties, overturned, without being able to fix on what &s;hould be &s;ub&s;tituted in their place. At one time, he determined to unite him&s;elf more clo&s;ely than ever with his allies, and to pu&s;h the war with vi|gour; at another, he inclined to bring all differences to a final accommodation by a treaty with Lannoy, who knowing his pa&s;&s;ion for negociation, &s;olicited him ince&s;|&s;antly with propo&s;als for that purpo&s;e. His timidity at length prevailed; and led him to conclude an agree|ment with Lannoy, of which the following were the chief articles: That a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms &s;hould take place between the Pontifical and Imperial troops for eight months; That Clement &s;hould advance &s;ixty thou&s;and crowns towards &s;atisfying the demands of the
<PB N="205" REF="011837_0613_0F9D8886AFBAB060">
Imperial army; That the Colonnas &s;hould be ab&s;olved from cen&s;ure, and their former dignities and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions be re&s;tored to them; That the viceroy &s;hould come to Rome, and prevent Bourbon from approaching nearer to that city, or to Florence <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Guic. l. 18. 436.</NOTE>. On this &s;udden treaty, which deprived him of all hopes of a&s;&s;i&s;tance from his allies, without affording him any &s;olid foundation of &s;e|curity, Clement relied &s;o firmly, that like a man extricat|ed at once out of all difficulties, he was at perfect ea&s;e, and in the fulne&s;s of his confidence di&s;banded all his troops, except as many as were &s;ufficient to guard his own per&s;on. This amazing confidence of Clement's, who on every other occa&s;ion was fearful and &s;u&s;picious to exce&s;s, appeared &s;o unaccountable to Guicciardini, who being at that time the pontifical commi&s;&s;ary-gene|ral and re&s;ident in the confederate army, had great op|portunity as well as great abilities for ob&s;erving how chimerical all his hopes were, that he imputes the Pope's conduct, at this juncture, wholly to infatuation, which tho&s;e who are doomed to ruin cannot avoid <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Guic. l. 18. 446.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>LANNOY, it would &s;eem, intended to have executed the treaty with great &s;incerity; and having detached Clement from the confederacy, wi&s;hed to turn Bour|bon's arms again&s;t the Venetians, who, of all the pow|ers at war with the Emperor, had exerted the greate&s;t vigour. With this view he di&s;patched a courier to Bourbon, informing him of the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms, which in the name of their common ma&s;ter, he had con|cluded with the Pope. Bourbon had other &s;chemes; and he had pro&s;ecuted them now too far to think of re|treating. To have mentioned a retreat to his &s;oldiers, would have been dangerous; his command was indepen|dant on Lannoy; he was fond of mortifying a man whom he had many rea&s;ons to hate; for the&s;e rea&s;ons, with|out paying the lea&s;t regard to the me&s;&s;age, he continued to ravage the eccle&s;ia&s;tical territories, and to advance towards Florence. Upon this, all Clement's terror and anxiety returning with new force, he had recour&s;e to Lannoy, and intreated and conjured him to put a &s;top to Bourbon's progre&s;s. Lannoy accordingly

&s;et out for his camp, but dur&s;t not approach it; Bour|bon's &s;oldiers having got notice of the truce, raged and threatened, demanding the accompli&s;hment of the pro|mi&s;es to which they had tru&s;ted; their general him&s;elf could &s;carce re&s;train them; every per&s;on in Rome, per|ceived that nothing remained but to prepare for re&s;i&s;t|ing a &s;torm which it was now impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;pel.

<P>BOURBON, on his part, was far from being free from &s;olicitude. All his attempts on any places of impor|tance had hitherto mi&s;carried; and Florence, towards which he had been approaching for &s;ome time, was, by the arrival of the Duke d'Urbino's army, put in a con|dition to &s;et his power at defiance. As it now became nece&s;&s;ary to change his rout, and to take in&s;tantly &s;ome new re&s;olution; he fixed without he&s;itation on one no le&s;s daring in it&s;elf, than it was impious according to the opinion of that age. This was to a&s;&s;ault and plun|der Rome. Many rea&s;ons, however, prompted him to it. He was fond of thwarting Lannoy, who had un|dertaken for the &s;afety of that city; he imagined that the Emperor would be highly plea&s;ed to &s;ee Clement, the chief author of the league again&s;t him, humbled; he flattered him&s;elf, that by gratifying the rapacity of his &s;oldiers with &s;uch immen&s;e booty, he would attach them for ever to his intere&s;t; or (which is &s;till more probable than any of the&s;e) he hoped that by means of the power and &s;plendour he would acquire from the conque&s;t of the fir&s;t city in Chri&s;tendom, he might lay the foundation of an independent power; and that after &s;haking off all connection with the Emperor, he might take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Naples, or of &s;ome of the Italian &s;tates in his own name <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Brant. 4. 271. 6. 189. Belcarii Comment. 594.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHATEVER his motives were, he executed his re&s;o|lution with a rapidity equal to the boldne&s;s with which he had formed it. His &s;oldiers, now that they had their prey in full view, complained neither of fatigue,
<PB N="207" REF="011837_0615_0F9D88883006C4F0">
nor famine, nor want of pay. No &s;ooner did they be|gin to move from Tu&s;cany towards Rome, than the Pope, &s;en&s;ible at la&s;t how fallacious the hopes had been on which he repo&s;ed, &s;tarted from his &s;ecurity. But no time now remained, even for a bold and deci&s;ive Pon|tiff, to have taken proper mea&s;ures, or to have formed any effectual plan of defence. Under Clement's feeble conduct, all was con&s;ternation, di&s;order and irre&s;olu|tion. He collected, however, &s;uch of his di&s;banded &s;oldiers as &s;till remained in the city; he armed the ar|tificers of Rome, and the footmen and train-bearers of the cardinals; he repaired the breaches in the walls; he begun to erect new works; he excommunicated Bourbon and all his troops, branding the Germans with the name of Lutherans, and the Spaniards with that of Moors <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Seckend. Lib. ii. 68.</NOTE>. Tru&s;ting to the&s;e ineffectual military preparations, or to his &s;piritual arms, which were &s;till more de&s;pi&s;ed by rapacious &s;oldiers, he &s;eems to have laid a&s;ide his natural timidity, and contrary to the ad|vice of all his coun&s;ellors, determined to wait the ap|proach of an enemy, whom, by a timely retreat, he might ea&s;ily have avoided.</P>
<P>BOURBON, who &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;patch, now that his intentions were known, advanced with &s;uch &s;peed, that he gained &s;everal marches on the Duke d'Ur|bino's army, and encamped in the plains of Rome on the evening of the fifth of May. From thence he &s;hew|ed his &s;oldiers the palaces and churches of that city, into which, as the capital of the Chri&s;tian commonwealth, the wealth of all Europe had flowed during many cen|turies, without having been once violated by any ho&s;tile hand; and commanding them to refre&s;h them&s;elves that night, as a preparation for the a&s;&s;ault next day, promi&s;ed them in reward of their toils and valour, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the trea&s;ures accumulated there.</P>
<P>EARLY in the morning, Bourbon, who had deter|mined to di&s;tingui&s;h that day either by his death, or the &s;ucce&s;s of his enterprize, appeared at the head of his troops, clad in compleat armour, above which he wore a ve&s;t of white ti&s;&s;ue, that he might be more con|&s;picuous
<PB N="208" REF="011837_0616_0F9D8888EF3A1680">
both to his friends and to his enemies; and as all depended on one bold impre&s;&s;ion, he led them in|&s;tantly to &s;cale the walls. Three di&s;tinct bodies, one of Germans, another of Spaniards, and the la&s;t of Italians, the three different nations of whom the army was com|po&s;ed, were appointed to this &s;ervice; a &s;eparate at|tack was a&s;&s;igned to each; and the whole army advan|ced to &s;upport them as occa&s;ion &s;hould require. A thick mi&s;t concealed their approach until they reached almo&s;t the brink of the ditch which &s;urrounded the &s;uburbs; having planted their ladders in a moment, each brigade ru&s;hed on to the a&s;&s;ault, with an impetuo&s;ity heightened by national emulation. They were received at fir&s;t with fortitude equal to their own; the Swi&s;s in the Pope's guards, and the veteran &s;oldiers who had been a&s;&s;em|bled, fought with a courage becoming men to whom the defence of the noble&s;t city in the world was entru&s;ted. Bourbon's troops, notwith&s;tanding all their valour, gained no ground, and even began to give way; when their leader, perceiving that on this critical moment the fate of the day depended, threw him&s;elf from his hor&s;e, pre&s;&s;ed to the front, &s;natched a &s;caling ladder from a &s;oldier, planted it again&s;t the wall, and began to mount it, encouraging his men with his voice and hand, to fol|low him, but at that very in&s;tant, a mu&s;ket bullet from the ramparts pierced his groin with a wound, which he immediately felt to be mortal; but he retained &s;o much pre&s;ence of mind as to de&s;ire tho&s;e who were near him to cover his body with a cloak, that his death might not di&s;hearten his troops; and &s;oon after he expired with a courage worthy of a better cau&s;e, and which would have entitled him to the highe&s;t prai&s;e, if he had thus fallen in defence of his country, not at the head of its enemies <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Bellay, 101.

<P>IT was impo&s;&s;ible, to conceal this fatal event from the army; the &s;oldiers &s;oon mi&s;&s;ed their general, whom they were accu&s;tomed to &s;ee in every time of danger; but in&s;tead of being di&s;heartened by their lo&s;s, it ani|mated them with new valour; the name of Bourbon re|&s;ounded

<P>DURING the combat, Clement was employed at the altar of St. Peter's in offering up to heaven unavailing prayers for victory. No &s;ooner was he informed that his troops began to give way than he fled with precipi|tation; and, with an infatuation &s;till more amazing than any thing already mentioned, in&s;tead of making his e&s;cape by the oppo&s;ite gate where there was no enemy to oppo&s;e it, he &s;hut him&s;elf up, together with thirteen cardinals, the foreign amba&s;&s;adors, and many per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, in the ca&s;tle of St. Angelo, which, from his late misfortune, he might have known to be an in|&s;ecure retreat. In his way from the Vatican to that for|tre&s;s, he &s;aw his troops flying before an enemy who pur|&s;ued without giving quarters; he heard the cries and lamentations of the Roman citizens, and beheld the be|ginning of tho&s;e calamities which his own credulity and ill conduct had brought upon his &s;ubjects <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Jov.

<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe, or even to imagine the mi&s;ery and horror of that &s;cene which followed. What|ever a city taken by &s;torm can dread from military rage, unre&s;trained by di&s;cipline; whatever exce&s;&s;es the fero|city of the Germans, the avarice of the Spaniards, or the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the Italians could commit, the&s;e the wretched inhabitants were obliged to &s;uffer. Churches, palaces, and the hou&s;es of private per&s;ons were plun|dered without di&s;tinction. No age, or character, or &s;ex was exempt from injury. Cardinals, nobles, prie&s;ts, matrons, virgins, were all the prey of &s;oldiers, and at the mercy of men deaf to the voice of humanity. Nor did the&s;e outrages cea&s;e, as is u&s;ual in towns which are carried by a&s;&s;ault, when the fir&s;t fury of the &s;torm was over; the Imperiali&s;ts kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Rome &s;everal months; and during all that time the in&s;olence and brutality of the &s;oldiers &s;carce abated. Their booty in ready money alone amounted to a million of ducats;

what they rai&s;ed by ran&s;oms and exactions far exceeded that &s;um. Rome, though taken &s;everal different times by the northern nations, who over-ran the empire in the fifth and &s;ixth centuries, was never treated with &s;o much cruelty by the barbarous and heathen Huns, Vandals or Goths, as now by the bigotted &s;ubjects of a Catholic Monarch <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Jov.

<P>AFTER Bourbon's death, the command of the Im|perial army devolved on Philibert de Chalons Prince of Orange, who with difficulty prevailed on as many of his &s;oldiers to de&s;i&s;t from the pillage, as were nece&s;&s;ary to inve&s;t the ca&s;tle of St. Angelo. Clement was immediate|ly &s;en&s;ible of his error in having retired into that ill pro|vided and untenable fort. But as the Imperiali&s;ts, &s;corning di&s;cipline, and intent only on plunder, pu&s;hed the &s;iege with little vigour, he did not de&s;pair of holding out until the Duke d'Urbino &s;hould come to his relief. That general advanced at the head of an army compo|&s;ed of Venetians, Florentines, and Swi&s;s in the pay of France, of &s;ufficient &s;trength to have delivered Clement from the pre&s;ent danger. But d'Urbino, perferring the indulgence of his hatred again&s;t the family of Medici to the glory of delivering the capital of Chri&s;tendom, and the head of the church, pronounced the enterprize to be too hazardous; and having from an exqui&s;ite refine|ment in revenge, marched forward &s;o far, that his army being &s;een from the ramparts of St. Angelo, flattered the Pope with the pro&s;pect of certain relief, he imme|diately retired <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Guic. l. 18. 450.</NOTE>.

who, by his &s;evere vigilance in guarding Francis, had given full proof of his being qualified for that office; and thus, by a &s;ingular accident, the &s;ame man had the cu&s;tody of the two mo&s;t illu&s;trious per&s;onages who had been made pri&s;oners in Europe during &s;everal ages.</P>
<P>THE account of this extraordinary and unexpected event was no le&s;s &s;urprizing than agreeable to the Em|peror.

<P>THE good fortune of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria was no le&s;s con&s;picuous in another part of Europe. Solyman hav|ing invaded Hungary with an army three hundred thou|&s;and &s;trong, Lewis II. King of that country, and of Bohemia, a weak and unexperienced Prince, advanced ra&s;hly to meet him with a body of men which did not amount to thirty thou&s;and. With an imprudence &s;till more unpardonable, he gave the command of the&s;e troops to Paul Tomorri, a Franci&s;can monk, archbi&s;hop of Golocza. This aukward general, in the dre&s;s of his order, girt with its cord, marched at the head of the troops; and hurried on by his own pre&s;umption, as well as by the impetuo&s;ity of nobles who de&s;pi&s;ed danger, but were impatient of long &s;ervice, fought the fatal battle of Monacz, in which the King, the flower of the Hungarian nobility, and upwards of twenty thou&s;and men fell the victims of his folly and ill conduct.

This claim was founded on a double title; the one derived from the antient preten&s;ions of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria to both kingdoms; the other from the right of his wife, the only &s;i&s;ter of the decea&s;ed Mo|narch, The feudal in&s;titutions, however, &s;ub&s;i&s;ted both in Hungary and Bohemia in &s;uch vigour, and the no|bles po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch exten&s;ive power, that the crowns were &s;till elective, and Ferdinand's rights, if they had not been powerfully &s;upported, would have met with little regard. But his own per&s;onal merit; the re&s;pect due to the brother of the greate&s;t Monarch in Chri&s;ten|dom; the nece&s;&s;ity of choo&s;ing a Prince able to afford his &s;ubjects &s;ome additional protection again&s;t the Turki&s;h arms, which, as they had felt their weight &s;o lately, they greatly dreaded; together with the intrigues of his &s;i&s;ter, who had been married to the late King, over|came the prejudices which the Hungarians had con|ceived again&s;t: the Archduke as a foreigner; and though a con&s;iderable party voted for the Waywode of Tran&s;il|vania, at length &s;ecured Ferdinand the throne of that kingdom. The &s;tates of Bohemia imitated the example of their neighbour kingdom; but, in order to a&s;certain and &s;ecure their own privileges, they obliged Ferdinand, before his coronation, to &s;ub&s;cribe a deed which they term a <HI>Rever&s;e,</HI> declaring that he held that crown not by any previous right, but by their gratuitous and vo|luntary election.

In a Diet of the empire held at Spires, the &s;tate of religion came to be con&s;idered, and all that the Emperor required of the Princes was, that they would wait patiently, and without encouraging in|novations, for the meeting of a general council, which he had demanded of the Pope. They, in return, acknow|ledged the convocation of a council to be the proper and regular &s;tep towards reforming abu&s;es in the church; but contended that a national council held in Germany would be more effectual for that purpo&s;e than what he had propo&s;ed. To this advice, concerning the di&s;cou|ragement of innovations, they paid &s;o little regard, that even during the meeting of the Diet at Spires, the di|vines who attended the Elector of Saxony and Land|grave of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el thither, preached publickly, and admini&s;tered the &s;acraments according to the rites of the reformed church <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 103.</NOTE>.

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE REIGN OF THE EMPEROR CHARLES V. BOOK V.</HEAD>
<P>THE account of the cruel manner in which the Pope had been treated, filled all Europe with a&s;toni&s;hment and horror. To &s;ee a Chri&s;tian Empe|ror, who, by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing that dignity, ought to have been the protector and advocate of the holy &s;ee, lay violent hands on him who repre&s;ented Chri&s;t on earth, and detain his &s;acred per&s;on in a rigorous captivity, was con&s;idered as an impiety that merited the &s;evere&s;t vengeance, and which called for the immediate inter|po&s;ition of every dutiful &s;on of the church. Francis and Henry, alarmed at the progre&s;s of the Imperial arms in Italy, had, even before the taking of Rome, entered into a clo&s;er alliance; and in order to give &s;ome check to the Emperor's ambition, had agreed to make a vigorous diver&s;ion in the Low-Countries 1527. The force of every motive which had influenced them at that time, was now increa&s;ed; and to the&s;e were added, the de&s;ire of re&s;cuing the Pope out of the Em|peror's hands, a mea&s;ure no le&s;s political, than it ap|peared to be pious. This, however, rendered it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to abandon their de&s;igns on the Low-Coun|tries, and to make Italy the &s;eat of war, as it was by

Francis being now &s;en&s;ible, that in his &s;y&s;tem with regard to the affairs of Italy, the &s;pirit of refinement had carried him too far; and that, by an exce&s;s of remi&s;&s;ne&s;s, he had allowed Charles to attain advantages which he might ea&s;ily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ve prevented, was eager to make reparation for an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">or for which he was not often guilty, by an activity more &s;uitable to his temper.

Wol&s;ey, whom Fran|cis had taken care to &s;ecure by flattery and pre&s;ents, the certain methods of gaining his favour, neglected nothing that could incen&s;e his ma&s;ter again&s;t the Em|peror. Be&s;ides all the&s;e public con&s;iderations, Henry was influenced by one of a more private nature; hav|ing begun about this time to form his great &s;cheme of divorcing Catharine of Aragon, towards the execution of which he knew that the &s;anction of Papal authority would be nece&s;&s;ary, he was de&s;irous to acquire as much merit as po&s;&s;ible with Clement, by appearing to be the chief in&s;trument of his deliverance.</P>
<P>THE negociation, between Princes thus di&s;po&s;ed, was not tedious. Wol&s;ey him&s;elf conducted it, on the part of his &s;overeign, with unbounded powers. Francis treated with him in per&s;on at Amiens, July 11, where the Cardinal appeared, and was received with royal magnificence. A marriage between the duke of Orleans and the prince&s;s Mary was agreed to as the ba&s;is of the confederacy; it was re&s;olved that Italy &s;hould be the theatre of war; the &s;trength of the ar|my which &s;hould take the field, and the contingent of troops or of money which each Prince &s;hould furni&s;h, were &s;ettled; and if the Emperor did not accept of the propo&s;als they were jointly to make him, they bound them&s;elves immediately to declare war, and to begin ho&s;tilities, Aug. 18. Henry, who took every re&s;o|lution with impetuo&s;ity, entered &s;o eagerly into this

new alliance, that in order to give Francis the &s;trong|e&s;t proof of his friend&s;hip and re&s;pect, he formally re|nounced the antient claim of the Engli&s;h Monarchs to the crown of France, which had long been the pride and ruin of the nation; as a full compen&s;ation for which, he accepted a pen&s;ion of fifty thou&s;and crowns, to be paid annually to him&s;elf and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Herbert, 83, &amp;c.

<P>MEANWHILE the Pope, being unable to fulfil the conditions of his capitulation, remained a pri&s;oner un|der the &s;evere cu&s;tody of Alarcon. The Florentines no &s;ooner heard of what had happened at Rome, than they ran to arms in a tumultuous manner; expelled the Cardinal di Cortona, who governed their city in the Pope's name; defaced the arms of the Medici; broke in pieces the &s;tatutes of Leo and Clement; and declaring them&s;elves a free &s;tate, re-e&s;tabli&s;hed their ancient popular government. The Venetians, taking advantage of the calamity of their ally the Pope, &s;eiz|ed Ravenna, and other places belonging to the church, under pretext of keeping them in depo&s;ite. The dukes of Urbino and Ferrara, laid hold likewi&s;e on part of the &s;poils of the unfortunate Pontiff, whom they con&s;idered as irretrievably ruined <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Guic. l. 18. 453.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>LANNOY, on the other hand, laboured to derive &s;ome &s;olid benefit from that unfore&s;een event, which gave &s;uch &s;plendour and &s;uperiority to his ma&s;ter's arms. For this purpo&s;e he marched to Rome, toge|ther with Moncada, and the marquis del Gua&s;to, at the head of all the troops they could a&s;&s;emble in the kingdom of Naples. The arrival of this reinforce|ment brought new calamities on the unhappy citizens of Rome; for the &s;oldiers envying the wealth of their companions, imitated their licence, and with the ut|mo&s;t rapacity gathered the gleanings, which had e&s;caped the avarice of the Spaniards and Germans. There was not now any army in Italy capable of making head again&s;t the Imperiali&s;ts; and nothing more was requi&s;ite to reduce Bologna, and the other towns in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate, than to have appeared before them. But the &s;oldiers having been &s;o long ac|cu&s;tomed,
<PB N="224" REF="011837_0626_0F9D88906F3CDD70">
under Bourbon, to an entire relaxation of di&s;cipline, and having ta&s;ted the &s;weets of living at di&s;cretion in a great city, almo&s;t without the controul of a &s;uperior, were become &s;o impatient of military &s;ubordination, and &s;o aver&s;e to &s;ervice, that they re|fu&s;ed to leave Rome, unle&s;s all their arrears were paid; a condition which they knew to be impo&s;&s;ible; and declared that they would not obey any other per&s;on than the prince of Orange, whom the army had cho&s;|en general. Lannoy, finding that it was no longer &s;afe for him to remain among licentious troops, who de&s;pi&s;ed his dignity, and hated his per&s;on, returned to Naples; &s;oon after the marquis del Gua&s;to and Moncada thought it prudent to quit Rome for the &s;ame rea&s;on. The Prince of Orange, a general only in name, and by the mo&s;t precarious of all tenures, the good will of &s;oldiers whom &s;ucce&s;s and licence had rendered capricious, was obliged to pay more attenti|on to their humours, than they did to his commands. Thus the Emperor, in&s;tead of reaping any of the ad|vantages he might have expected from the reduction of Rome, had the mortification to &s;ee the mo&s;t formi|dable body of troops he had ever brought into the field, continue in a &s;tate of inactivity from which it was im|po&s;&s;ible to rouze them <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Guic. l. 18. 454.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS gave the King of France and the Venetians lei&s;ure to form new &s;chemes, and to enter into new engagements for the delivering the Pope, and pre|&s;erving the liberties of Italy. The newly re&s;tored re|public of Florence very imprudently joined with them, and Lautrec, of who&s;e abilities the Italians entertain|ed a much more favourable opinion than his own ma&s;ter, was, in order to gratify them, appointed ge|nerali&s;&s;imo of the league. It was with the utmo&s;t re|luctance he undertook that office, being unwilling to expo&s;e him&s;elf a &s;econd time to the difficulties and di&s;|graces which the negligence of the King, or the ma|lice of his favourites might bring upon him. The be&s;t troops in France marched under his command, and the King of England, though he had not yet declared war again&s;t the Emperor, advanced a con&s;iderable
<PB N="225" REF="011837_0627_0F9D889130EF7358">
&s;um towards carrying on the expedition. Lautrec's fir&s;t operations were prudent, vigorous, and &s;ucce&s;sful. By the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Andrew Doria, the able&s;t &s;ea offi|cer of that age, he rendered him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Genoa, and re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in that republic the faction of the Frego&s;i, together with the dominion of France. He obliged Alexandria to &s;urrender after a &s;hort &s;iege, and reduced all the country on that &s;ide of the Te&s;ino. He took Pavia, which had &s;o long re&s;i&s;ted the arms of his &s;overeign, by a&s;&s;ault, and plundered it with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">; cruelty which the memory of the fatal di&s;a&s;ter that had befallen the French nation before its walls naturally in&s;pired. All the Milane&s;e, which Antonia de Leyva defended with a &s;mall body of troops kept together and &s;upported by his own addre&s;s and indu&s;try, mu&s;t have &s;oon &s;ubmitted to his power, if he had continu|ed to bend the force of his arms again&s;t that country. But Lautrec dur&s;t not compleat a conque&s;t which would have been &s;o honourable to him&s;elf, and of &s;uch advantage to the league. Francis knew his con|federates to be more de&s;irous of circum&s;cribing the Imperial power in Italy, than of acquiring new terri|tories for him, and was afraid that if Sforza were once re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in Milan, they would &s;econd but cool|ly the attack which he intended to make on the king|dom of Naples. For this rea&s;on he in&s;tructed Lau|trec not to pu&s;h his operations with too much vigour in Lombardy; and happily the importunities of the Pope, and the &s;ollicitations of the Florentines, the one for relief, and the other for protection, were &s;o urgent as afforded him a decent pretext to march for|ward without yielding to the entreaties of the Vene|tians and Sforza, who in&s;i&s;ted on his laying &s;iege to Milan <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Guic l. xviii. p. 461. de Bellay, 170, &amp;c.

<P>WHILE Lautrec advanced &s;lowly towards Rome, the Emperor had time to deliberate concerning the di&s;po&s;al of the Pope's per&s;on, who &s;till remained a pri&s;oner in the ca&s;tle of St. Angelo.

appears to have been but little under the influ|ence of religious con&s;iderations, and had frequently on this occa&s;ion expre&s;&s;ed an inclination to tran&s;port the Pope into Spain, that he might indulge his am|bition with the &s;pectacle of the two mo&s;t illu&s;trious per|&s;onages in Europe &s;ucce&s;&s;ively pri&s;oners in his court. But the fear of giving new offence to all Chri&s;tendom, and of filling his own &s;ubjects with horror, obliged him to forego that &s;atisfaction <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Guic. l. 18. 457.</NOTE>. The progre&s;s of the confederates made it now nece&s;&s;ary either to &s;et the Pope at liberty, or to remove him to &s;ome place of confinement more &s;ecure than the ca&s;tle of St. Angelo. Many con&s;iderations induced him to prefer the form|er, particularly his want of the money requi&s;ite as well for recruiting his army, as for paying off the va&s;t arrears due to it. In order to obtain this he had a&s;&s;embled the Cortes of Ca&s;tile at Valladolid about the beginning of the year, and having laid before them the &s;tate of his affairs, and repre&s;ented the nece&s;&s;ity of making great preparations to re&s;i&s;t the enemies, whom envy at the &s;ucce&s;s which had crowned his arms would unite again&s;t him, he demanded a large &s;upply in the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing terms. But the Cortes, as the nation was already exhau&s;ted by extraordinary donativ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, re|fu&s;ed to load it with any new burden, and in &s;pite of all his endeavours to gain or to intimidate the mem|bers, per&s;i&s;ted in this re&s;olution <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Sandov. i. p. 814.</NOTE>. No re&s;ource, therefore remained but the extorting from Clement, by way of ran&s;om, a &s;um &s;ufficient for di&s;charging what was due to his troops, without which it was vain to mention to them their leaving Rome.</P>
<P>NOR was the Pope inactive on his part, or his in|trigues un&s;ucce&s;sful towards ha&s;tening &s;uch a treaty. By &s;lattery, and the appearance of unbounded confi|dence, he di&s;armed the re&s;entment of the cardinal Colonna, and wrought upon his vanity, which made him de&s;irous of &s;hewing the world that as his power had at fir&s;t depre&s;&s;ed the Pope, it would now rai&s;e him to his former dignity. By favours and promi&s;es he gained Morone, who, by one of tho&s;e whim&s;ical revo|lutions

The ad|dre&s;s and influence of two &s;uch men ea&s;ily removed all the difficulties of the Emperor's amba&s;&s;adors, and brought to a conclu&s;ion the treaty for Clement's li|berty, upon conditions hard indeed, but not more intolerable than a Prince in his &s;ituation had rea&s;on to expect. He was obliged to advance in ready money an hundred thou&s;and crowns for the u&s;e of the army; to pay the &s;ame &s;um at the di&s;tance of a fortnight; and at the end of three months, an hundred and fifty thou&s;and more. He engaged not to take part in the war again&s;t Charles, either in Lombardy or in Naples; he granted him a cruzado, and the tenth of eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal revenues in Spain; and he not only gave ho&s;tages, but put the Emperor in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;everal towns, as &s;ecurity for the performance of the&s;e articles <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Guic. l. 18. 467, &amp;c.</NOTE>.

two Monarchs, di&s;covered an inclination to relax &s;omewhat the rigour of the treaty of Madrid, to which hitherto, he had adhered inflexibly. He of|fered to accept of the two millions of crowns which Francis had propo&s;ed to pay as an equivalent for the dutchy of Burgundy, and to &s;et his &s;ons at liberty on condition that he would recal his army out of Italy, and re&s;tore Genoa together with the other conque&s;ts he had made in that country. With regard to Sforza, he in&s;i&s;ted that his fate &s;hould be determined by the judges appointed to enquire into his crimes. The&s;e propo&s;itions being made to Henry, he tran&s;mitted them to his ally the French King, whom it more near|ly concerned to examine, and to an&s;wer them; and if Francis had been &s;incerely &s;ollicitous either to con|clude peace, or pre&s;erve con&s;i&s;tency in his own con|duct, he ought in&s;tantly to have clo&s;ed with overtures which differed but little from the propo&s;itions he him|&s;elf had formerly made <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Recueil des Traitez, 2. 249.</NOTE>. But his views were now much changed; his alliance with Henry; Lautrec's progre&s;s in Italy, and the &s;uperiority of his army there above that of the Emperor, &s;carce left him room to doubt of the &s;ucce&s;s of his enterprize again&s;t Naples. Full of the&s;e &s;anguine hopes, he was at no lo&s;s to find pretexts for rejecting or evading what the Emperor had propo&s;ed. Under the appearance of &s;ympathy with Sforza, for who&s;e intere&s;ts he had not hitherto di&s;covered much &s;olicitude, he again demanded the full and unconditional re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of that unfor|tunate prince in his dominions. Under colour of its being imprudent to rely on the Emperor's &s;incerity, he in&s;i&s;ted that his &s;ons &s;hould be &s;et at liberty before the French troops left Italy, or &s;urrendered Genoa. The unrea&s;onablene&s;s of the&s;e demands, as well as the re|proachful in&s;inuation with which they were accompa|nied, irritated Charles to &s;uch a degree that he could &s;carce li&s;ten to them with patience; and repenting of his moderation which had made &s;o little impre&s;&s;ion on his enemies, declared that he would not depart in the &s;malle&s;t article from the conditions he had now offer|ed.

<P>NEXT day January 22. 1528 two heralds who had accompanied the emba&s;&s;adors on purpo&s;e, though they had hitherto concealed their character, having a&s;&s;u|med the en&s;igns of their office, appeared in the Empe|ror's court, and being admitted into his pre&s;ence, they in the name of their re&s;pective ma&s;ters, and with all the &s;olemnity cu&s;tomary on &s;uch occa&s;ions, denounced war again&s;t him. Charles received both with a digni|ty &s;uitable to his own rank, but &s;poke to each in a tone adapted to the &s;entiments which he entertained of their &s;overeigns. He accepted the defiance of the Engli&s;h Monarch with a firmne&s;s tempered by &s;ome degree of decency and re&s;pect. His reply to the French King abounded with that acrimony of expre&s;&s;ion, which per&s;onal rival&s;hip, exa&s;perated by the memory of many injuries inflicted as well as &s;uffered, natural|ly &s;ugge&s;ts. He de&s;ired the French herald to acquaint his &s;overeign, that he would henceforth con&s;ider him as a ba&s;e violator of public faith, and a &s;tranger to the honour and integrity becoming a gentleman.

&s;uch general attention, and carried along with it &s;o much authority, as gave ri&s;e to an important change in manners all over Europe. Duels, as has already been ob&s;erved, had long been permitted by the laws of all the European nations, and forming a part of their juri&s;prudence, were authorized by the magi|&s;trate on many occa&s;ions as the mo&s;t proper method of terminating que&s;tions with regard to property, or of deciding in tho&s;e which re&s;pected crimes. But &s;ingle combats being con&s;idered as &s;olemn appeals to the om|ni&s;cience and ju&s;tice of the &s;upreme Being, they were allowed only in public cau&s;es, according to the pre|&s;cription of law, and carried on in a judicial form. Men accu&s;tomed to this manner of deci&s;ion in courts of ju&s;tice, were naturally led to apply it to per&s;onal and private quarrels. Duels, which at fir&s;t could be appointed by the civil judge alone, were fought with|out the interpo&s;ition of his authority, and in ca&s;es to which the laws did not extend. The tran&s;action be|tween Charles and Francis &s;trongly countenanced this practice. Upon every affront, or injury which &s;eem|ed to touch his honour, a gentleman thought him&s;elf entitled to draw his &s;word, and to call on his adver&s;a|ry to make reparation. Such an opinion introduced among men, of fierce courage, of high &s;pirit, and of rude manners, when offence was often given, and re|venge was always prompt, produced mo&s;t fatal con&s;e|quences. Much of the be&s;t blood in Chri&s;tendom was &s;hed; many u&s;eful lives were &s;acrificed; and at &s;ome periods, war it&s;elf hath &s;carce been more de&s;tructive than the&s;e conte&s;ts of honour. So powerful, howe|ver, is the dominion of fa&s;hion, that neither the ter|ror of penal laws, nor reverence for religion have been able entirely to aboli&s;h a practice unknown among the ancients, and not ju&s;tifiable by any principle of rea&s;on; though at the &s;ame time it mu&s;t be admitted, that to this ab&s;urd cu&s;tom, we mu&s;t a&s;cribe in &s;ome degree the extraordinary gentlene&s;s and complai&s;ance of mo|dern manners, and that re&s;pectful attention of one man to another, which, at pre&s;ent, render the &s;ocial intercour&s;es of life far more agreeable and decent than among the mo&s;t civilized nations of antiquity.</P>

His army, which was now increa&s;ed to thirty-five thou&s;and men, advanced by great marches towards Naples. The terror of their approach, as well as the remon&s;trances and the entreaties of the prince of Orange, prevailed at la&s;t on the Imperial troops, though with difficulty to quit Rome, of which they had kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion during ten months. But of that flouri&s;hing army which had entered the city, &s;carce one half re|mained; the re&s;t, cut off by the plague, or wa&s;ted by di&s;ea&s;es, the effects of their inactivity, intemperance, and debauchery, fell victims to their own crimes<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Guic. l. 18. 487.</NOTE>. Lau|trec made the greate&s;t efforts to attack them in their retreat towards the Neapolitan territories, which would have fini&s;hed the war at one blow. But the prudence of their leaders di&s;appointed all his mea&s;ures, and con|ducted them with little lo&s;s to Naples. The people of that kingdom, always the prey of every invader, ex|tremely impatient to &s;hake off the Spani&s;h yoke, re|ceived the French with open arms, wherever they ap|peared to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and Gaeta and Naples ex|cepted, &s;carce any place of importance remained in the hands of the Imperiali&s;ts. The pre&s;ervation of the former was owing to the &s;trength of its fortifications, that of the latter to the pre&s;ence of the Imperial army. Lautrec, however &s;at down before Naples, but finding it vain to think of reducing by force a city defended by &s;o many troops, he was obliged to employ the &s;low|er, but le&s;s dangerous method of blockade; and hav|ing taken mea&s;ures which appeared to him effectual, he confidently a&s;&s;ured his ma&s;ter, that famine would &s;oon compel the be&s;ieged to capitulate. The&s;e hopes were &s;trongly confirmed by the defeat of a vigorous attempt made by the enemy in order to recover the command of the &s;ea. The gallies of Andrew Doria, under the command of his nephew Philippino, guard|ed the mouth of the harbour. Moncada, who had &s;uc|ceeded Lannoy in the viceroyalty, rigged out a num|ber of gallies &s;uperior to Doria's, and going on board

But Doria, by his &s;uperior &s;kill in naval operations, ea&s;ily triumphed over the valour and number of the Spani|ards. The viceroy was killed, mo&s;t of his fleet de|&s;troyed, and Gau&s;to, with many officers of di&s;tinction being taken pri&s;oners, were put on board the captive gallies, and &s;ent by Philippino, as trophies of his vic|tory, to his uncle<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Guic. l. 19. 487.

<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding this flattering pro&s;pect of &s;uc|ce&s;s, many circum&s;tances concurred to fru&s;trate Lau|trec's expectations. Clement, tho' he always acknow|ledged his being indebted to Francis for the recovery of his liberty, and often complained of the cruel treat|ment he had met with from the Emperor, was not influenced at this juncture by principles of gratitude, nor which was more extraordinary, was he &s;wayed by the de&s;ire of revenge. His pa&s;t misfortunes render|ed him more cautious than ever, and his recollection of the errors which he had committed, increa&s;ed the natu|ral irre&s;olution of his mind. While he amu&s;ed Fran|cis with promi&s;es, he &s;ecretly negociated with Charles; and being &s;ollicitous, above all things, to re-e&s;tabli&s;h-his family in Florence with their ancient authority which he could not expect from Francis, who had entered into &s;trict alliance with the new republick, he leaned rather towards the &s;ide of his enemy than that of his benefactor, and gave Lautrec no a&s;&s;i&s;tance towards carrying on his operations. The Venetians, viewing with jealou&s;y the progre&s;s of the French arms, were intent only on recovering &s;uch maritime towns in the Neapolitan dominions as were to be po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by their republick, while they were altogether carele&s;s about the reduction of Naples, on which the &s;ucce&s;s of the common cau&s;e depended <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Guic. l. xix. 491.</NOTE>.

<P>THESE unexpected events retarded the progre&s;s of the French, and di&s;couraged both the general and his troops; but the revolt of Andrew Doria proved a fa|tal blow to all their mea&s;ures. That gallant officer, the citizen of a republick, and trained up from his infancy in the &s;ea-&s;ervice, retained the &s;pirit of inde|pendance natural to the former, and the plain liberal manners peculiar to the latter. A perfect &s;tranger to the arts of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion or flattery nece&s;&s;ary in courts, and con&s;cious at the &s;ame time of his own merit and importance, he always offered his advice with free|dom, and often preferred his complaints and remon|&s;trances with boldne&s;s. The French mini&s;ters, unac|cu&s;tomed to &s;uch liberties, determined to ruin a man who treated them with &s;o little deference; and though Francis him&s;elf had a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of Doria's &s;ervices, as well as an high e&s;teem for his character, the courtiers, by continually repre&s;enting him as a man haughty, intractable, and more &s;ollicitous to aggrandize him|&s;elf, than to promote the intere&s;t of France, gradual|ly undermined the foundations of his credit, and fill|ed the King's mind with &s;u&s;picion and di&s;tru&s;t. From thence proceeded &s;everal affronts and indignities put upon Doria. His appointments were not regularly paid; his advice, even in naval affairs, was often &s;lighted; an attempt was made to &s;eize the pri&s;oners taken by his nephew in the &s;ea-&s;ight off Naples; all which he bore with abundance of ill humour. But an injury offered to his country, tran&s;ported him beyond all bounds of patience. The French be|gan to fortify Savona, to clear its habour, and re|moving thither &s;ome branches of trade carried on at

Genoa, plainly &s;hewed that they intended to render that town, long the object of jealou&s;y and hatred to the Genoe&s;e, their rival in wealth and commerce. Doria, animated with a patriotic zeal for the honour and intere&s;t of his country, remon&s;trated again&s;t this in the highe&s;t tone, not without threats, if the mea|&s;ure were not in&s;tantly abandoned. This bold action, aggravated by the malice of the courtiers, and placed in the mo&s;t odious light, irritated Francis to &s;uch a de|gree, that he commanded Barbe&s;ieux, whom he ap|pointed admiral of the Levant, to &s;ail directly to Ge|noa, with the French fleet, to arre&s;t Doria, and to &s;eize his gallies. This ra&s;h order, of which the mo&s;t profound &s;ecrecy alone could have &s;ecured the execu|tion, was concealed with &s;o little care, that Doria got timely intelligence of it, and retired with all his gal|lies to a place of &s;afety. Gau&s;to his pri&s;oner, who had long ob&s;erved and fomented his growing di&s;content, and had often allured him by magnificent promi&s;es to enter into the Emperor's &s;ervice, laid hold on this fa|vourable opportunity. While his indignation and re|&s;entment were at their height, he prevailed on him to di&s;patch one of his officers to the Imperial court with his overtures and demands. The negociation was not long; Charles fully &s;en&s;ible of the importance of &s;uch an acqui&s;ition, granted him whatever terms he re|quired. Doria &s;ent back his commi&s;&s;ion, together with the collar of St. Michael to Francis, and hoi&s;ting the Imperial colours, &s;ailed with all his gallies towards Naples, not to block up the harbour of that unhappy city as he had formerly engaged, but to bring them protection and deliverance.</P>

<P>THE lo&s;s of Genoa followed immediately upon the ruin of the army in Naples. To deliver his country from the dominion of foreigners was Doria's highe&s;t ambition, and had been his principal inducement to
<PB N="236" REF="011837_0638_0F9D88996F2E23E8">
quit the &s;ervice of France, and enter into that of the Emperor. A mo&s;t favourable opportunity for execu|ting this honourable enterprize now pre&s;ented it&s;elf. The city of Genoa, afflicted by the pe&s;tilence, was al|mo&s;t de&s;erted by its inhabitants: the French garri&s;on being neither regularly paid nor recruited, was redu|ced to an incon&s;iderable number; Doria's emi&s;&s;aries found that &s;uch of the citizens as remained, being weary alike of the French and Imperial yoke, the ri|gour of which they had alternately felt, were ready to welcome him as their deliverer, and to &s;econd all his mea&s;ures. Things wearing this promi&s;ing a&s;pect, he &s;ailed towards the coa&s;t of Genoa; on his approach the French gallies retired; a &s;mall body of men which he landed, &s;urprized one of the gates of Genoa in the night time; Trivulci, the French governor, with his feeble gari&s;on, Sept. 12, &s;hut him&s;elfup in the citadel, and Doria took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town without blood&s;hed or re&s;i&s;tance. Want of provi&s;ions quickly obliged Tri|vulci to capitulate; the people, eager to aboli&s;h &s;uch an odious monument of their &s;ervitude, ran together with a tumultuous violence, and levelled the citadel with the ground.</P>
<P>IT was now in Doria's power to have rendered him|&s;elf the &s;overeign of his country, which he had &s;o hap|pily freed from oppre&s;&s;ion. The fame of his former actions, the &s;ucce&s;s of his pre&s;ent attempt, the attach|ment of his friends, the gratitude of his countrymen, together with the &s;upport of the Emperor, all con&s;pi|red to facilitate his attaining the &s;upreme authority, and invited him to lay hold of it. But with a magnanimity of which there are few examples, he &s;acrificed all thoughts of aggrandizing him&s;elf to the virtuous &s;atisfaction of e&s;tabli&s;hing liberty in his country, the highe&s;t object at which ambition can aim. Having a&s;&s;embled the whole body of the people in the court before his palace, he a&s;&s;ured them, that the happine&s;s of &s;eeing them once more in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of freedom, was to him a full re|ward for all his &s;ervices; that more delighted with the name of citizen than of &s;overeign, he claimed no pre|eminence or power above his equals; but remitted en|tirely to them the right of &s;ettling what form of go|vernment

they would now chu&s;e to be e&s;tabli&s;hed among them. The people li&s;tened to him with tears of admiration, and of joy. Twelve per&s;ons were elected to new-model the con&s;titution of the republic. The influence of Doria's virtue and example, commu|nicated it&s;elf to his countrymen; the factions which had long torn and ruined the &s;tate, &s;eemed to be for|gotten; prudent precautions were taken to prevent their reviving; and the &s;ame form of government which hath &s;ub&s;i&s;ted with little variations &s;ince that time in Genoa, was e&s;tabli&s;hed with univer&s;al applau&s;e. Doria, lived to a great age, beloved, re&s;pected and honoured by his countrymen; and adhering uniform|ly to his profe&s;&s;ions of moderation, without arrogat|ing any thing unbecoming a private citizen, he pre|&s;erved a great a&s;cendant over the councils of the republic, which owed its being to his genero&s;ity. The authority he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed was more flattering as well as more &s;atisfactory, than that derived from &s;overeign|ty; a dominion founded in love and in gratitude; and upheld by veneration for his virtues, not by the dread of his power.

<P>AMIDST the&s;e vigorous operations in the field each party di&s;covered an impatient de&s;ire of peace and continual negociations were carried on for that pur|po&s;e. The French King di&s;couraged, and almo&s;t ex|hau&s;ted by &s;o many un&s;ucce&s;sful enterprizes, was re|duced now to think of obtaining the relea&s;e of his &s;ons by conce&s;&s;ions, not by the terror of his arms. The Pope hoped to recover by a treaty whatever he had lo&s;t in the war. The Emperor, notwith&s;tanding the advantages which he had gained, had many rea&s;ons to make him wi&s;h for an accommodation; Solyman, having over-run Hungary, was ready to break in up|on the Au&s;trian territories with the whole force of the Ea&s;t; the Reformation gained ground daily in Ger|many, the princes who favoured it entered into a con|federacy, which he thought dangerous to the tran|quillity of the Empire; the Spaniards murmured at a war the weight of which re&s;ted chiefly on them; the variety and extent of his operations, far exceeded what his revenues could &s;upport; his &s;ucce&s;s hitherto had been owing chiefly to his own good fortune, and to the abilities of his generals, nor could he flatter him|&s;elf that they with troops de&s;titute of every thing ne|ce&s;&s;ary, would always triumph over enemies &s;till in a condition to renew their attacks. All parties, however, were at equal pains to conceal, or to di&s;&s;emble their real &s;entiments. The Emperor, that his inability to carry on the war might not be &s;u&s;pected, in&s;i&s;ted on high terms in the tone of a conqueror. The Pope, &s;o|licitous not to lo&s;e his pre&s;ent allies, before he came to any agreement with Charles, continued to make a thou&s;and prote&s;tations of fidelity to the former, while he privately negociated with the latter. Francis, a|fraid that his confederates might prevent him by treat|ing for them&s;elves with the Emperor, had recour&s;e to many di&s;honourable artifices in order to turn their at|tention from the mea&s;ures which he was taking to ad|ju&s;t all differences with his rival.</P>

<P>THUS Francis, chiefly from his impatience to pro|cure liberty to his &s;ons, &s;acrificed every thing which had at fir&s;t prompted him to take arms, or which had induced him, by continuing ho&s;tilities, during nine &s;ucce&s;&s;ive campaigns, to protract the war at a length &s;carce known in Europe before the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;tanding armies, and the impo&s;itions of exorbitant taxes became univer&s;al. The Emperor, by this trea|ty,
<PB N="241" REF="011837_0643_0F9D889DB761B818">
was rendered &s;ole arbiter of the fate of Italy; he delivered his territories in the Netherlands from an ignominious badge of &s;ubjection; and after having baffled his rival in the field, he pre&s;cribed to him the conditions of peace. The different conduct and &s;pirit with which the two Monarchs carried on the opera|tions of war, led naturally to &s;uch an i&s;&s;ue of it. Charles, inclined by temper, as well as obliged by his &s;ituation, concerted all his &s;chemes with caution, pur&s;ued them with per&s;everance; and ob&s;erving cir|cum&s;tances and events with attention, let none e&s;cape that could be improved to advantage. Francis, more enterpri&s;ing than &s;teady, undertook great de&s;igns with warmth, but executed them with remi&s;&s;ne&s;s; and, diverted by his plea&s;ures, or deceived by his fa|vourites, he often lo&s;t the mo&s;t promi&s;ing opportuni|ties of &s;ucce&s;s. Nor had the character of the two ri|vals them&s;elves greater influence on the operations of the war, than the oppo&s;ite qualities of the generals whom they employed. Among the Imperiali&s;ts, va|lour tempered with prudence; fertility of invention aided by experience; &s;agacity to penetrate the de&s;igns of their enemies, as well as to conduct their own, with all the talents that form great commanders and en&s;ure victory, were con&s;picuous. Among the French, the&s;e qualities were either wanting, or the very rever&s;e of them abounded; nor could they boa&s;t of one man (unle&s;s we except Lautrec, who was always unfortu|nate) that equalled the merit of Pe&s;cara, Leyva, Gua&s;|to, the prince of Orange, and other leaders whom Charles had to &s;et in oppo&s;ition to them. Bourbon, Morone, and Doria, who might have been capable of balancing by their abilities and conduct the &s;uperiori|ty which the Imperiali&s;ts had acquired, were lo&s;t through the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of the King, and the malice or inju&s;tice of his coun&s;ellors; and the mo&s;t fatal blows given to France during the progre&s;s of the war, pro|ceeded from the de&s;pair and re&s;entment of the&s;e three per&s;ons, who were forced to abandon her &s;ervice.</P>
<P>THE hard conditions to which Francis was obliged to &s;ubmit, were not the mo&s;t afflicting circum&s;tance to him in the treaty of Cambray. He lo&s;t his reputa|tion

They exclaimed loudly again&s;t this ba&s;e and perfidious action, of which Francis him&s;elf was &s;o much a&s;hamed, that, in order to avoid the pain of hearing from their amba&s;&s;adors the reproaches which he ju&s;tly merited, it was &s;ome time before he would con&s;ent to allow them an audience. Charles, on the other hand, was attentive to the intere&s;t of every per&s;on who had adhered to him; the rights of &s;ome of his Flemi&s;h &s;ubjects, who had e&s;tates or pre|ten&s;ions in France, were &s;ecured; one article was in|&s;erted, obliging Francis to re&s;tore the blood and me|mory of the Con&s;table Bourbon; and to grant his heirs the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his lands which had been for|feited; another, by which indemnification was &s;tipu|lated for tho&s;e French gentlemen who had accompa|nied Bourbon in his exile <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Guic. l. 19. p. 525.

This conduct, laudable in it&s;elf, and placed in the mo&s;t &s;triking light by a compari&s;on with that of Francis, gained Charles as much e&s;teem as the &s;ucce&s;s of his arms had acquired him glory.</P>
<P>FRANCIS, did not treat the King of England with the &s;ame neglect as his other allies. He communicat|ed to him all the &s;teps of his negociation at Cambray, and luckily found that Monarch in a &s;ituation which left him no choice, but to approve implicitly of his mea&s;ures, and to concur with them. Henry had been &s;olliciting the Pope for &s;ome time, in order to obtain a divorce from Catharine of Aragon his Queen. Several motives combined in prompting the King to urge this &s;uit; as he was powerfully influenced at &s;ome

&s;ea&s;ons by religious con&s;iderations, he entertained ma|ny &s;cruples concerning the legitimacy of his marriage with his brother's widow; his affections had long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> e&s;tranged from the Queen, who was older than him&s;elf, and had lo&s;t all the charms &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the earlier part of her life; he was pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;i|rous of having male i&s;&s;ue; Wol&s;ey artfully fortified his &s;cruples, and encouraged his hopes, that he might widen the breach between him and the Emperor, Ca|tharine's nephew; and, what was more forcible per|haps in its operation than all the&s;e united, the King had conceived a violent love for the celebrated Anne Boleyn, a young lady of great beauty, and of great|er accompli&s;hments, whom, as he found it impo&s;&s;ible to gain her on other terms, he determined to rai&s;e to the throne. The Papal authority had often been in|terpo&s;ed to grant divorces for rea&s;ons le&s;s &s;pecious than tho&s;e which Henry produced. When the matter was fir&s;t propo&s;ed to Clement, during his impri&s;onment in the ca&s;tle of St. Angelo, as his hopes of recovering liberty depended entirely on the King of England, and his ally of France, he expre&s;&s;ed the warme&s;t in|clination to gratify him. But no &s;ooner was he &s;et free, than he di&s;covered other &s;entiments. Charles, who e&s;pou&s;ed the protection of his aunt with zeal in|flamed by re&s;entment, alarmed the Pope on the one hand with threats which made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on his timid mind; and allured him on the other with tho&s;e promi&s;es in favour of his family, which he after|wards accompli&s;hed. Upon the pro&s;pect of the&s;e Cle|ment not only forgot all his obligations to Henry, but ventured to endanger the intere&s;t of the Romi&s;h religi|on in England, and to run the ri&s;k of alienating that kingdom for ever from the obedience of the Papal &s;ee. After amu&s;ing Henry during two years, with all the &s;ubtleties and chicane which the court of Rome can &s;o dextrou&s;ly employ to protract or defeat any cau&s;e; after di&s;playing the whole extent of his am|biguous and deceitful policy, the intricacies of which the Engli&s;h hi&s;torians, to whom it properly belongs, have found it no ea&s;y matter to trace and unravel; he, at la&s;t, recalled the powers of the delegates whom he

had appointed to judge in the point, avocated the cau&s;e to Rome, leaving the King no other hope of ob|taining a divorce but from the per&s;onal deci&s;ion of the Pope him&s;elf. As Clement was now in &s;trict alliance with the Emperor, who had purcha&s;ed his friend&s;hip by &s;uch exorbitant conce&s;&s;ions, Henry de&s;paired of procuring any &s;entence from the former, but what was dictated by the latter. His honour, however, and pa&s;|&s;ions concurred in preventing him from relinqui&s;hing his &s;cheme of a divorce, which he determined to ac|compli&s;h by other means, and at any rate; and the continuance of Francis's friend&s;hip being nece&s;&s;ary to counterbalance the Emperor's power, he, in order to &s;ecure that, not only offered no remon&s;trances again&s;t the total neglect of their allies, in the treaty of Cam|bray, but made Francis the pre&s;ent of a large &s;um, as a brotherly contribution towards the payment of the ran&s;om for his &s;ons <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Herbert.

<P>MEANWHILE the Emperor landed in Italy with a nu|merous train of the Spani&s;h nobility, and a con&s;idera|ble body of troops. He left the government of Spain during his ab&s;ence to the Empre&s;s I&s;abella. By his long re&s;idence in that country, he had acquired &s;uch thorough knowledge of the character of the people, that he could perfectly accommodate the maxims of his government to their genius. He could even a&s;&s;ume, upon &s;ome occa&s;ions, &s;uch popular manners, as gain|ed wonderfully upon the Spaniards. A &s;triking in|&s;tance of his di&s;po&s;ition to gratify them had occurred a few days before he embarked for Italy: He was to make his public entry into the city of Barcelona; and &s;ome doubts having ari&s;en among the inhabitants, whether they &s;hould receive him as Emperor, or as Count of Barcelona, Charles in&s;tantly decided in fa|vour of the latter, declaring that he was more proud of that antient title, than of his Imperial crown. Soothed with this flattering expre&s;&s;ion of his regard, the citizens welcomed him with acclamations of joy, and the &s;tates of the province &s;wore allegiance to his &s;on Philip, as heir of the county of Barcelona.

<P>THE Emperor appeared in Italy with the pomp and power of a conqueror; and amba&s;&s;adors from all the princes and &s;tates of that country attended his court waiting to receive his deci&s;ion with regard to their fate. At Genoa, where he fir&s;t landed, he was receiv|ed with the acclamations due to the protector of their liberties. Having honoured Doria with many marks of di&s;tinction, and be&s;towed on the republick &s;everal new privileges, he proceeded to Bologna, the place fixed upon for his interview with the Pope. He af|fected to unite in his publick entry into that city the &s;tate and maje&s;ty that &s;uited an Emperor, with the humility becoming an obedient &s;on of the church; and while at the head of twenty thou&s;and veteran &s;ol|diers, able to give law to all Italy, he kneeled down to ki&s;s the feet of that very Pope whom he had &s;o lately detained a pri&s;oner. The Italians, after &s;uffer|ing &s;o much from the ferocity and licentiou&s;ne&s;s of his armies, and after having been long accu&s;tomed to form in their imagination a picture of Charles which bore &s;ome re&s;emblance to that of the barbarous Mo|narchs of the Goths or Huns, who had formerly af|flicted their country with the like calamities, were &s;urprized to &s;ee a prince of a graceful appearance, af|fable and courteous in his deportment, of regular manners, and of exemplary attention to all the offices of religion <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Sandov.

Charles, from all the&s;e con|&s;iderations, finding it nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;ume an air of mo|deration, acted his part with a good grace. He admitt|ed Sforza into his pre&s;ence, and not only gave him a full pardon of all pa&s;t offences, but granted him the inve&s;|titure of the duchy together with his neice the King of Denmark's daughter in marriage.

The Florentines alone did not partake of this general joy. Animated with a zeal for liberty more laudable than prudent, they determined to oppo&s;e the re&s;toration of the Medici. The Imperial army had already entered their territories, and formed the &s;iege of their capital. But though de&s;erted by all their allies, and left without any hope of &s;uccour, they defended them|&s;elves many months with an ob&s;tinate valour worthy of better &s;ucce&s;s, and even when they &s;urrenderd, they obtained a capitulation which gave them hopes of &s;e|curing &s;ome remains of their liberty.

His pre|&s;ence became every day more nece&s;&s;ary in that coun|try, and was &s;olicited with equal importunity by the catholicks and by the favourers of the new doctrines. During that long interval of tranquillity which the ab&s;ence of the Emperor, the conte&s;ts between him
<PB N="248" REF="011837_0650_0F9D88A26FFAA378">
and the Pope, and his attention to the war with France afforded them, the latter had gained much ground. Mo&s;t of the princes who had embraced Luther's opi|nions, had not only e&s;tabli&s;hed in their territories that form of wor&s;hip which he approved, but had entirely &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the rites of the Romi&s;h church. Many of the free cities had imitated their conduct. Almo&s;t one half of the Germanick body had revolted from the pa|pal &s;ee, and its dominion, even in that part which had not hitherto &s;haken off the yoke, was con&s;iderably weakened by the example of the neighbouring &s;tates, or by the &s;ecret progre&s;s of tho&s;e doctrines which had undermined it among them. Whatever &s;atisfaction the Emperor, while he was at open enmity with the &s;ee of Rome, might have felt in tho&s;e events that tended to mortify and embarra&s;s the Pope, he could not help perceiving now, that the religious divi&s;ions in Germany would, in the end; prove extremely hurtful to the Imperial authority. The weakne&s;s of former Emperors had &s;uffered the great va&s;&s;als of the Empire to make &s;uch &s;ucce&s;sful encroachments upon their power and prerogative, that during the whole cour&s;e of a war, which had often required the exertion of his utmo&s;t &s;trength, Charles &s;carce drew any effectual aid from Germany, and found that magnificent titles or ob&s;olete preten&s;ions were almo&s;t the only advanta|ges which he had gained by &s;waying the Imperial &s;cep|tre. He now became fully &s;en&s;ible that if he did not recover in &s;ome degree the prerogatives which his pre|dece&s;&s;ors had lo&s;t, and acquire the authority, as well as po&s;&s;e&s;s the name of head of the Empire, his high dignity would contribute more to ob&s;truct than to pro|mote his ambitious &s;chemes. Nothing, he &s;aw, was more e&s;&s;ential towards attaining this than to &s;uppre&s;s opinions which might form new bonds of confederacy among the princes of the Empire, and unite them by ties &s;trong|er and more &s;acred than any political connection. No|thing &s;eemed to lead more certainly to the accompli&s;h|ment of his de&s;igns, than to employ zeal for the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed religion, of which he was the natural protec|tor, as the in&s;trument of extending his civil authority.</P>

The decree of the diet a&s;&s;embled there in the year one thou&s;and five hundred and twenty &s;ix, which was almo&s;t equi|valent to a toleration of Luther's opinions, had given great offence to the re&s;t of Chri&s;tendom. The great|e&s;t delicacy of addre&s;s, however, was requi&s;ite in pro|ceeding to any deci&s;ion more rigorous. The minds of men kept in perpetual agitation by a controver&s;y car|ried on during twelve years without intermi&s;&s;ion of debate, or abatement of zeal, were now inflamed to an high degree. They were accu&s;tomed to innova|tions, and &s;aw the bolde&s;t of them &s;ucce&s;eful. Hav|ing not only aboli&s;hed old rites, but &s;ub&s;tituted new forms in their place, they were influenced as much by attachment to the &s;y&s;tem which he had embraced, as by aver&s;ion to that which they had abandoned. Lu|ther him&s;elf, of a &s;pirit not to be worn out by the length and ob&s;tinacy of the combat, or to become re|mi&s;s upon &s;ucce&s;s, continued the attack with as much vigour as he had begun it. His di&s;ciples, of whom many equalled him in zeal, and &s;ome &s;urpa&s;&s;ed him in learn|ing, were no le&s;s capable than their ma&s;ter to conduct the controver&s;y in the propere&s;t manner. Many of the laity, and even of the princes, trained up amid&s;t the&s;e ince&s;&s;ant di&s;putations, and in the habit of li&s;|tening to the arguments of the contending parties who alternately appealed to them as judges, came to be profoundly &s;killed in all the que&s;tions which were agi|tated, and, upon occa&s;ion, could &s;hew them&s;elves not in expert in any of the arts with which the&s;e theological encounters were managed.

At the Emperor's de|&s;ire, all the Prote&s;tant princes forbad the divines who accompanied them to preach in publick during their re&s;idence at Aug&s;burg. For the &s;ame rea&s;on they em|ployed Melancthon, the man of the greate&s;t learning, as well as of the mo&s;t pacific and gentle &s;pirit among the Reformers, to draw up a confe&s;&s;ion of their faith, expre&s;&s;ed in terms as little offen&s;ive to the Roman Ca|tholics, as a regard for truth would permit.

<P>FROM the divines, among whom his endeavours had been &s;o un&s;ucce&s;sful, Charles turned to the princes their patrons. Nor did he find them, how de&s;irous &s;oever of accommodation, or willing to oblige the Emperor, more di&s;po&s;ed than the former to renounce their opinions. At that time, zeal for religion took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the minds of men to a degree which can &s;carce be conceived by tho&s;e who live in an age when the pa&s;&s;ions excited by the fir&s;t manife&s;tation of truth, and the fir&s;t recovery of liberty, have in great mea|&s;ure cea&s;ed to operate.

<P>EVERY &s;cheme in order to gain or di&s;unite the Pro|te&s;tant party proving abortive, nothing now remained for the Emperor but to take &s;ome vigorous mea&s;ures towards a&s;&s;erting the doctrines and authority of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church. The&s;e, Campeggio, the Papal nuncio, had always recommended as the only proper and effectual cour&s;e of dealing with &s;uch ob&s;tinate he|retics. In compliance with his opinions and remon|&s;trances, the diet i&s;&s;ued a decree (November 19,) con|demning mo&s;t of the peculiar tenets held by the Pro|te&s;tants; forbidding any per&s;on to protect or tolerate tho&s;e who taught them; enjoining a &s;trict ob&s;ervance of the e&s;tabli&s;hed rites; and prohibiting any further innovation under &s;evere penalties. All orders of men were required to a&s;&s;i&s;t with their per&s;ons and fortunes in carrying this decree into execution; and &s;uch as refu&s;ed to obey it were declared incapable of acting as judges, or of appearing as parties in the Imperial cham|ber, the &s;upreme court of judicature in the Empire. To all which was &s;ubjoined a promi&s;e that an applica|tion &s;hould be made to the Pope, requiring him to call a general council within &s;ix months, in order to ter|minate all controver&s;ies by its &s;overeign deci&s;ions<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Sleid. 139.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE &s;everity of this decree, which they con&s;idered as a prelude to the mo&s;t violent per&s;ecutions, alarmed the Prote&s;tants, and convinced them that the Empe|ror was re&s;olved on their de&s;truction. The dread of tho&s;e calamities which were ready to fall on the church, oppre&s;&s;ed the feeble &s;pirit of Melancthon; and as if the the cau&s;e had already been de&s;perate, he gave him&s;elf

up to melancholy and lamentation. But Luther, who during the meeting of the diet endeavoured to con|firm and animate his party by &s;everal treati&s;es which he addre&s;&s;ed to them, was not di&s;concerted or di&s;may|ed at the pro&s;pect of this new danger.

Sleid. 140.</NOTE>. His exhortations made the deeper impre&s;&s;ion upon them as they were greatly alarmed at that time by the account of a combination among the Popi&s;h princes of the Empire for the maintenance of the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed religion, to which Charles him&s;elf had acced|ed<NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Seck. ii. 200. iii. 11.</NOTE>. This convinced them that it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tand on their guard; and that their own &s;afety as well as the &s;ucce&s;s of their cau&s;e depended on union. Filled with this dread of the adver&s;e party, and with the&s;e &s;entiments concerning the conduct proper for them|&s;elves, they a&s;&s;embled at Smalkalde. There, they concluded a league of mutual defence again&s;t all ag|gre&s;&s;ors<NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Sleid. Hi&s;t. 142.</NOTE> (December 22,) by which they formed the Prote&s;tant &s;tates of the Empire into one regular body, and beginning already to con&s;ider them&s;elves as &s;uch, they re&s;olved to apply to the Kings of France and Eng|land, and to implore them to a&s;&s;i&s;t and patronize their new confederacy.</P>
<P>AN affair not connected with religion furni&s;hed them with a pretence for courting the aid of foreign princes. Charles, who&s;e ambitious views enlarged in proportion to the increa&s;e of his power and grandeur, had formed a &s;cheme of continuing the Imperial crown in his family, by procuring his brother Ferdinand to be elected King of the Romans. The pre&s;ent juncture was favourable for the execution of that de&s;ign. The Emperor's arms had been every where victorious; he had given law to all Europe at the late peace; no rival now remained in a condition to balance or to controul him; and the Electors, dazzled by the &s;plendour of his &s;ucce&s;s, or over-awed by the greatne&s;s of his pow|er, dur&s;t &s;carce di&s;pute the will of a prince who&s;e &s;ol|licitations
<PB N="255" REF="011837_0657_0F9D88A7AFF98268">
carried with them the authority of com|mands. Nor did he want plau&s;ible rea&s;ons to enforce the mea&s;ure. The affairs of his other kingdoms, he &s;aid, obliged him to be often ab&s;ent from Germany; the growing di&s;orders occa&s;ioned by the controver&s;ies about religion, as well as the formidable neighbour|hood of the Turks, who continually threatened to break in with their de&s;olating armies into the heart of the Empire, required the con&s;tant pre&s;ence of a prince, endowed with prudence capable of compo&s;ing the for|mer, and with power and valour &s;ufficient to repel the latter. His brother Ferdinand po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the&s;e quali|ties in an eminent degree; by re&s;iding long in Ger|many, he had acquired a thorough knowledge of their con&s;titution and manners; having been pre&s;ent al|mo&s;t from the fir&s;t ri&s;e of their religious di&s;&s;en&s;ions, he knew what remedies were mo&s;t proper, what they could bear, and how to apply them; as his own do|minions lay on the Turki&s;h frontier, he was the na|tural defender of Germany again&s;t the inva&s;ions of the Infidels, being prompted by intere&s;t no le&s;s than he would be bound in duty to oppo&s;e them.</P>
<P>THESE arguments made little impre&s;&s;ion on the Prote&s;tants. Experience taught them, that nothing had contributed more to the undi&s;turbed progre&s;s of their opinions, than the interregnum after Maximilian's death, the long ab&s;ence of Charles, and the &s;lackne&s;s in the reins of government which the&s;e occa&s;ioned; after deriving &s;uch advantages from a &s;tate of anarchy, they were extremely unwilling to give them&s;elves a new and a fixed ma&s;ter. They perceived clearly the extent of Charles's ambition, that he aimed at render|ing the Imperial crown hereditary in his family, and would of cour&s;e e&s;tabli&s;h in the Empire an ab&s;olute do|minion, to which elective princes could not have a&s;|pired with equal facility. They determined therefore to oppo&s;e Ferdinand's election with the utmo&s;t vigour, and to rou&s;e their countrymen by their example and exhortations, to with&s;tand this encroachment on their liberties. The Elector of Saxony accordingly, not only refu&s;ed to be pre&s;ent in the electoral college, which the Emperor &s;ummoned to meet at Cologne (January

But the other Electors, whom Charles had been at great pains to gain, without regarding either his ab&s;ence, or prote&s;t, cho&s;e Ferdinand King of the Romans; who a few days after was crowned at Aix-la-Chapelle <NOTE N="x" PLACE="marg">Sleid. 142.

<P>THE account of this tran&s;action, as well as of the commencement of &s;ome pro&s;ecutions again&s;t them on account of their religious principles, in the Imperial chamber, being brought to the Prote&s;tants, who were a&s;&s;embled a &s;econd time at Smalkalde, they thought it nece&s;&s;ary both to renew their former confederacy, and immediately to di&s;patch their amba&s;&s;adors into France and England (Febru. 29). Francis had ob&s;erved, with all the jealou&s;y of a rival, the reputation which the Emperor had acquired by his &s;eeming di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s and moderation in &s;ettling the affairs of Italy; and be|held with great concern, the &s;ucce&s;sful &s;tep which he had taken towards perpetuating and extending his au|thority in Germany by the election of a King of the Romans. Nothing however, would have been more impolitic than to precipitate into a new war his king|dom exhau&s;ted by extraordinary efforts, and di&s;|couraged by ill &s;ucce&s;s, before it had got time to re|cruit its &s;trength, or to forget pa&s;t misfortunes. Nor could he, when no provocation had been given, and &s;carce a pretext had been afforded him, violate a trea|ty of peace which he him&s;elf had &s;o lately &s;olicited, without forfeiting the e&s;teem of all Europe, and be|ing dete&s;ted as a prince void of probity and honour. He ob&s;erved, with great joy, powerful factions begin|ning to form in the Empire; he li&s;tened with the ut|mo&s;t eagerne&s;s to the complaints of the Prote&s;tant prin|ces; and without &s;eeming to countenance their religi|ous opinions, determined &s;ecretly to cheri&s;h tho&s;e &s;parks of political di&s;cord which might be afterwards kindled into a flame. For this purpo&s;e, he &s;ent Wil|liam de Bellay, one of the able&s;t negociators in France, into Germany, who vi&s;iting the courts of the male-content

<P>THE King of England, highly incen&s;ed again&s;t Charles, in complai&s;ance to whom, the Pope had long retarded, and now openly oppo&s;ed his divorce, was no le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed than Francis to &s;trengthen a league which might be rendered &s;o formidable to the Empe|ror. But his favourite project of the divorce led him into &s;uch a labyrinth of &s;chemes and negociations, and he was, at the &s;ame time, &s;o intent on aboli&s;hing the papal juri&s;diction in England, that he had no lei&s;ure for foreign affairs; and was obliged to &s;atisfy him&s;elf with giving general promi&s;es, together with a &s;mall &s;upply in money to the confederates of Smalkalde <NOTE N="z" PLACE="marg">Herbert, 152, 154.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, many circum&s;tances convinced Charles that this was not a juncture when the extirpation of he|re&s;y was to be attempted by violence and rigour; that, in compliance with the Pope's inclinations, he had alrea|dy proceeded with imprudent precipitation; and that it was more his intere&s;t to con&s;olidate Germany into one united and vigorous body, than to divide and en|feeble it by a civil war. The Prote&s;tants, already con|&s;iderable by their numbers, and their zeal, had now acquired additional weight and importance by their joining in that confederacy into which the ra&s;h &s;teps taken at Aug&s;burg had forced them. Having now di&s;covered their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wn &s;trength, they de&s;pi&s;ed the deci|&s;ions of the Imperial chamber; and being &s;ecure of foreign protection, were ready to &s;et the head of the Empire at defiance. At the &s;ame time his peace with France was precarious, the friend&s;hip of an irre&s;olute and intere&s;ted pontiff was not to be relied on; and Solyman, in order to repair the infamy and lo&s;s which

his arms had &s;u&s;tained in the former campaign, was preparing to enter Au&s;tria with more numerous for|ces. On all the&s;e accounts, e&s;pecially the la&s;t, a &s;pee|dy accommodation with the malecontent princes, was nece&s;&s;ary not only for the accompli&s;hment of his fu|ture &s;chemes, but for a&s;certaining his pre&s;ent &s;afety. Negociations were, accordingly, carried on by his di|rection with the Elector of Saxony and his a&s;&s;ociates, (1532;) after many delays occa&s;ioned by their jealou&s;y of the Emperor, and of each other, after innumerable difficulties ari&s;ing from the inflexible nature of religi|ous tenets, which cannot admit of being altered, mo|dified, or relinqui&s;hed in the &s;ame manner as points of political intere&s;t, terms of pacification were agreed upon at Nuremberg, (July 23) and ratified &s;olemnly in the Diet at Rati&s;bon (Augu&s;t 3). In this treaty, it was &s;tipulated, That univer&s;al peace be e&s;tabli&s;hed in Germany, until the meeting of a general council, the convocation of which within &s;ix months the Emperor &s;hall endeavour to procure; That no per&s;on be mole&s;t|ed on account of religion; That a &s;top be put to all proce&s;&s;es begun by the Imperial chamber again&s;t Pro|te&s;tants, and the &s;entences already pa&s;&s;ed to their de|triment be declared void. On their part, the Prote&s;|tants engaged to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Emperor with all their for|ces in re&s;i&s;ting the inva&s;ion of the Turks<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Du Mont Corps Diplomatique, tom. iv. part ii. 87, 89.</NOTE>. Thus by their firmne&s;s in adhering to their principles, by the unanimity with which they urged all their claims, and by their dexterity in availing them&s;elves of the Emperor's &s;ituation, the Prote&s;tants obtained terms which amounted almo&s;t to a toleration of their religi|on; all the conce&s;&s;ions were made by Charles, none by them; even the favourite point of approving his brother's election was not mentioned; and the Pro|te&s;tants of Germany, who had hitherto been viewed only as a religious &s;ect, came henceforth to be con&s;i|dered as a political body of no &s;mall con&s;equence<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 149, &amp;c.

<P>THE intelligence which Charles received of Soly|man's having entered Hungary at the head of three hundred thou&s;and men cut &s;hort the deliberations of

the Diet at Rati&s;bon; the contingent both of troops and money which each prince was to furni&s;h towards the defence of the Empire having been already &s;ettled. The Prote&s;tants as a te&s;timony of their gratitude to the Emperor, exerted them&s;elves with extraordinary zeal, and brought into the field forces that exceeded in number the quota impo&s;ed on them; and the Ca|tholics imitating their example, one of the greate&s;t and be&s;t appointed armies that had ever been levied in Germany, a&s;&s;embled near Vienna. Being joined by a body of Spani&s;h and Italian veterans under the mar|quis del Gua&s;to; by &s;ome heavy armed cavalry from the Low-Countries; and by the troops which Ferdi|nand had rai&s;ed in Bohemia, Au&s;tria and his other ter|ritories, it amounted in all to ninety thou&s;and di&s;ci|plined foot, and thirty thou&s;and hor&s;e, be&s;ides a pro|digious &s;warm of irregulars. Of this va&s;t army, worthy the fir&s;t Prince in Chri&s;tendom, the Emperor took the command in per&s;on; and mankind waited in &s;u&s;pence the i&s;&s;ue of a deci&s;ive battle between the two greate&s;t Monarchs in the world. But each of them dreading the other's power and good fortune, they both conducted their operations with &s;uch ex|ce&s;&s;ive caution, that a campaign, for which &s;uch im|men&s;e preparations had been made, ended without any memorable event. Solyman finding it impo&s;&s;ible to gain ground upon an enemy always attentive, and on his guard, marched back to Con&s;tantinople to|wards the end of autumn<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Jovii.

It is remarkable that in &s;uch a martial age, when every gentleman was a &s;oldi|er, and every prince a general, this was the fir&s;t time that Charles, who had already carried on &s;uch exten|&s;ive wars, and gained &s;o many victories, appeared at the head of his troops.

<P>IMMEDIATELY after the retreat of the Turks, Charles, impatient to revi&s;it Spain, &s;et out, on his way thither, for Italy. As he was extremely de&s;i|rous of an interview with the Pope, they met a &s;e|cond time at Bologna, with the &s;ame external de|mon&s;trations of re&s;pect and friend&s;hip, but with little of that confidence which had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them during their late negotiations there. Clement was much di&s;&s;atisfied with the Emperor's proceedings at Aug&s;burg; his conce&s;&s;ions with regard to the &s;peedy convocation of a council, having more than cancelled all the merit of the &s;evere decree again&s;t the doctrines of the Reformers. The toleration granted to the Pro|te&s;tants at Rati&s;bon, and the more explicit promi&s;e concerning a council with which it was accompanied, had irritated him &s;till farther. Charles, however, partly from conviction that the meeting of a council would be attended with &s;alutary effects, and partly from his de&s;ire to plea&s;e the Germans, having &s;olicited him by his amba&s;&s;adors to call that a&s;&s;embly without delay, and now urging the &s;ame thing in per&s;on, Clement was greatly embara&s;&s;ed what reply he &s;hould make to a reque&s;t, which it was indecent to refu&s;e, and dangerous to grant. He endeavoured at fir&s;t to divert Charles from the mea&s;ure, but finding him in|flexible, he had recour&s;e to artifices which he knew would delay, if not entirely defeat the calling of that a&s;&s;embly. Under the plau&s;ible pretext of its being previou&s;ly nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ettle, with all parties con|cerned, the place of the council's meeting; the man|ner of its proceedings; the right of the per&s;ons who &s;hould be admitted to vote; and the authority of their deci&s;ions; he di&s;patched a nuncio, accompanied by an amba&s;&s;ador from the Emperor, to the Elector of Saxony, as the head of the Prote&s;tants. With re|gard to each of the&s;e articles, inextricable difficulties and conte&s;ts aro&s;e. The prote&s;tants demanded a

council to be held in Germany; the Pope in&s;i&s;ted that it &s;hould meet in Italy; they contended that a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> points in di&s;pute &s;hould be determined by the words of the holy &s;cripture alone; he con&s;idered the decrees of the church, and the opinions of fathers and doctors as of equal authority; they required a free council in which the divines commi&s;&s;ioned by different churches &s;hould be allowed a voice; he aimed at modelling the coun|cil in &s;uch a manner as would render it entirely de|pendent on his plea&s;ure: Above all, the Prote&s;tants thought it unrea&s;onable that they &s;hould bind them|&s;elves to &s;ubmit to the decrees of a council, before they knew on what Principles the&s;e decrees were to be founded, by what per&s;ons they were to be pro|nounced, and what forms of proceeding they would ob&s;erve. The Pope maintained it to be altogether un|nece&s;&s;ary to call a council, if tho&s;e who demanded it did not not previou&s;ly declare their re&s;olution to ac|quie&s;ce in its decrees. In order to adju&s;t &s;uch a varie|ty of points, many expedients were propo&s;ed, and the negociations &s;pun out to &s;uch a length, as effectually an&s;wered Clement's purpo&s;e of putting off the meet|ing of a council, without drawing on him&s;elf the whole infamy of ob&s;tructing a mea&s;ure which all Eu|rope deemed &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the good of the church<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">F. Paul. Hi&s;t. 61. Seckend iii. 73.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>TOGETHER with this negociation about calling a council, the Emperor carried on another which he had &s;till more at heart, for &s;ecuring the peace e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in Italy. As Francis had renounced his pre|ten&s;ions in that country with great reluctance, Charles made no doubt but that he would lay hold on the fir&s;t pretext afforded him, or embrace the fir&s;t opportunity which pre&s;ented it&s;elf of recovering what he had lo&s;t. It became nece&s;&s;ary, on this account, to take mea&s;ures for a&s;&s;embling an army able to oppo&s;e him. As his trea&s;ury, drained by a long war, could not &s;upply the &s;ums requi&s;ite for keeping &s;uch a body con&s;tantly on foot, he attempted to throw that burden on his allies, and to provide for the &s;afety of his own dominions at their expence, by propo&s;ing that the Italian &s;tates &s;hould enter into a league of defence again&s;t all inva|ders;
<PB N="262" REF="011837_0664_0F9D88ACEFD8EE90">
that, on the fir&s;t appearance of danger, an ar|my &s;hould be rai&s;ed and maintained at the common charge; and that Antonio de Leyva &s;hould be ap|pointed the generali&s;&s;imo. Nor was the propo&s;al un|acceptable to Clement, though for a rea&s;on very dif|ferent from that which induced the Emperor to make it, (1533.) He hoped, by this expedient, to deliver Italy from the German and Spani&s;h veterans which had &s;o long filled all the powers in that country with terror, and &s;till kept them in &s;ubjection to the Imperi|al yoke. A league was accordingly concluded (Feb. 24); all the Italian &s;tates, the Venetians excepted, acceded to it; the &s;um which each of the contracting parties &s;hould furni&s;h towards maintaining the army was fix|ed; the Emperor agreed to withdraw the troops which gave &s;o much umbrage to his allies, and which he was unable any longer to &s;upport. Having di&s;banded part of them, and removed the re&s;t to Sicily and Spain, he embarked on board Doria's gallies, and arrived at Barcelona, (April 22) <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Guic. l. xx. 551.

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all his precautions for &s;ecur|ing the peace of Germany and maintaining that &s;y&s;|tem which he had e&s;tabli&s;hed in Italy, the Emperor became every day more and more apprehen&s;ive that both would be &s;oon di&s;turbed by the intrigues or arms of the French King. His apprehen&s;ions were well founded, as nothing but the de&s;perate &s;ituation of his affairs could have brought Francis to give his con&s;ent to a treaty &s;o di&s;honourable and di&s;advantageous as that of Cambray: He at the very time of ratifying it, had formed a re&s;olution to ob&s;erve it no longer than nece&s;|&s;ity compelled him, and took a &s;olemn prote&s;t, though with the mo&s;t profound &s;ecrecy, again&s;t &s;everal arti|cles in the treaty, particularly that whereby he re|nounced all preten&s;ions to the dutchy of Milan, as un|ju&s;t, injurious to his heirs, and invalid. One of the crown lawyers, by his command, entered a prote&s;t to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, and with the like &s;ecrecy, when the ratification of the treaty was regi&s;tered in the parliament of Paris <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Du Mont.

thought that, by employing an artifice unworthy of a King, de&s;tructive of public faith, and of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">tual confidence on which all tran&s;actions between nations are founded, he was relea&s;ed from any obligations to perform the mo&s;t &s;olemn promi&s;es, or to adhere to the mo&s;t &s;acred engagements. From the moment he concluded the peace of Cambray, he wi&s;hed and watched for an opportunity of violating it with &s;afety. He endeavoured for that rea&s;on to &s;trengthen his alli|ance with the King of England, who&s;e friend&s;hip he cultivated with the greate&s;t a&s;&s;iduity. He put the mi|litary force of his own kingdom on a better and more re&s;pectable footing than ever. He artfully fo|mented the jealou&s;y and di&s;content of the German princes.</P>
<P>BUT above all, Francis laboured to break the &s;trict confederacy which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between Charles and Cle|ment; and he had &s;oon the &s;atisfaction to ob&s;erve appearances of di&s;gu&s;t and alienation ari&s;ing in the mind of that &s;u&s;picious and intere&s;ted Pontiff, which gave him hopes that their union would not be la&s;ting. As the Emperor's deci&s;ion in favour of the Duke of Ferrara had greatly irritated the Pope, Francis aggra|vated the inju&s;tice of that proceeding, and flattered him that the Papal &s;ee would find in him a more impartial and no le&s;s powerful protector. As the importunity with which Charles demanded a council was extremely offen|&s;ive to the Pope, Francis artfully created ob&s;tacles to prevent it, and attempted to divert the German princes, his allies, from in&s;i&s;ting &s;o ob&s;tinately on that point <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Bellay, 141, &amp;c. Seck. iii. 48. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Paul, 63.</NOTE>. As the Emperor had gained &s;uch an a&s;cendant over Clement by contributing to aggrandize his family, Francis endeavoured to allure him by the &s;ame irre&s;i&s;ti|ble bait, propo&s;ing a marriage between his &s;econd &s;on Henry duke of Orleans, and Catharine, the daughter of the Pope's cou&s;in Laurence di Medici. On the fir&s;t overtures of this match, the Emperor could not per|&s;uade him&s;elf that Francis really intended to deba&s;e the royal blood of France by an alliance with Catha|rine, who&s;e ance&s;tors had been &s;o lately private citi|zens

He thought it nece&s;&s;ary, however to eface the impre&s;|&s;ion which &s;uch a dazzling offer might have made, by promi&s;ing to break off the marriage which had been agreed to between his own niece the King of Den|mark's daughter, and the Duke of Milan, and to &s;ub&s;titute Catherine in her place. But the French amba&s;&s;adors producing unexpectedly full powers to conclude the marriage treaty with the duke of Or|leans, this expedient had no effect, Clement was &s;o highly plea&s;ed with an honour which added &s;uch lu&s;|tre and dignity to the hou&s;e of Medici, that he offer|ed to grant Catharine the inve&s;titure of con&s;iderable territories in Italy by way of portion; he &s;eemed rea|dy to &s;upport Francis in pro&s;ecuting his ancient claims in that country, and con&s;ented to a per&s;onal inter|view with that Monarch <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Guic. l. xx. 551. 533. Belay, 138.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CHARLES was at the utmo&s;t pains to prevent a meeting, in which nothing was likely to pa&s;s but what would be of detriment to him; nor could he bear, after he had twice conde&s;cended to vi&s;it the Pope, in his own territories, that Clement &s;hould be&s;tow &s;uch a mark of di&s;tinction on his rival, as to venture on a voyage by &s;ea, at an unfavourable &s;ea|&s;on, in order to pay court to Francis in the French dominions. But the Pope's eagerne&s;s to accompli&s;h the match overcame all &s;cruples of pride, or fear, or jealou&s;y, which mu&s;t have influenced him on any other occa&s;ion. The interview notwith&s;tanding &s;everal artifi|ces of the Emperor to prevent it, took place at Mar|&s;eilles with extraordinary pomp, and demon&s;trations of confidence on both &s;ides; and the marriage, which the ambition and abilities of Catharine rendered in the &s;equel as fatal to France, as it was then thought di&s;|honourable, was con&s;ummated, (1534). But what|ever &s;chemes may have been &s;ecretly concerted by the Pope and Francis in favour of the duke of Orleans, to whom his father propo&s;ed to make over all his rights in Italy, &s;o careful were they to avoid giving any cau&s;e of offence to the Emperor, that no treaty was con|cluded between them <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Guic. l. 20. 555.</NOTE>; and even in the marriage ar|ticles,
<PB N="265" REF="011837_0667_0F9D88AF2F08C968">
Catharine renounced all claims and pre|ten&s;ions in Italy, except to the dutchy of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Du Mont Corps Diplom. iv. p. ii. 101.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT at the very time when he was carrying on the&s;e negociations, and forming this connection with Francis, which gave &s;o great umbrage to the Empe|ror, &s;uch was the artifice and duplicity of Clement's character that he &s;uffered the latter to direct all his proceedings with regard to the King of England, and was no le&s;s attentive to gratify him in that particular, than if the mo&s;t cordial union had &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted be|tween them. Henry's &s;uit for a divorce had now con|tinued near &s;ix years; during all which period the Pope negociated, promi&s;ed, retracted, and conclud|ed nothing. After bearing repeated delays and di&s;|appointments, longer than could have been expected from a prince of &s;uch a cholerick and impetuous tem|per, his patience was at la&s;t &s;o much exhau&s;ted, that he applied to another tribunal for that decree which he had &s;olicited in vain at Rome. Cranmer, archbi|&s;hop of Canterbury, by a &s;entence founded on the authority of Univer&s;ities, Doctors, and Rabbies, who had been con&s;ulted with re&s;pect to the point, annull|ed the King's marriage with Catharine; her daughter was declared illegitimate; and Anne Boleyn acknow|ledged as Queen of England. At the &s;ame time Hen|ry began to neglect and to threaten the Pope whom he had hitherto courted, and to make innovations in the church, of which he had formerly been &s;uch a zeal|ous defender. Clement, who had already &s;een &s;o many provinces and kingdoms revolt from the Holy &s;ee, became apprehen&s;ive at la&s;t that England would imitate their example, and partly from his &s;olicitude to pre|vent that fatal blow, partly in compliance with the French King's &s;olicitations, determined to give Henry &s;uch &s;atisfaction as might &s;till retain him within the bo|&s;om of the church. But the violence of the Cardi|nals, devoted to the Emperor, did not allow the Pope lei&s;ure for executing this prudent re&s;olution, and hur|ried him with a precipitation fatal to the Roman &s;ee, to i&s;&s;ue a bull (March 23,) re&s;cinding Cranmer's &s;entence, confirmed Henry's marriage with Catharine, and de|claring

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">im excommunicated, if, within a time &s;peci|fied, he did not abandon the wife he had taken, and return to her whom he had de&s;erted. Enraged at this unexpected decree, Henry kept no longer any mea|&s;ures with the court of Rome; his &s;ubjects &s;econded his re&s;entment and indignation; an act of parliament was pa&s;&s;ed, aboli&s;hing the papal power and juri&s;dicti|on in England; by another, the King was declared &s;upreme head of the church, and all the authority of which the Pope<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> were deprived was ve&s;ted in him. That va&s;t fabrick of eccle&s;ia&s;tical dominion which had been rai&s;ed with &s;uch art, and who&s;e foundations &s;eemed &s;o deep, being no longer &s;upported by the ve|neration of the people, was overturned in a moment. Henry him&s;elf, with the caprice peculiar to his cha|racter, continued to defend the doctrines of the Ro|mi&s;h church as fiercely as he attacked its juri&s;diction. He alternately per&s;ecuted the Prote&s;tants for rejecting the former, and the Catholicks for acknowledging the latter. But his &s;ubjects being once permitted to enter into new paths, did not chu&s;e to &s;top &s;hort at the preci&s;e point pre&s;cribed by him. Having been encouraged by his example to break &s;ome of their fetters, they were &s;o impatient to &s;hake off all that remained <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Herbert. Burn. Hi&s;t. of Reform.</NOTE>, that in the following reign, with the ge|neral applau&s;e of the nation, a total &s;eparation was made from the church of Rome in articles of doctrine, as well as in matters of di&s;cipline and juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>A SHORT delay might have &s;aved the See of Rome from all the unhappy con&s;equences of Clement's ra&s;h|ne&s;s. Soon after his &s;entence again&s;t Henry, he fell into a langui&s;hing di&s;temper, which gradually wa&s;t|ing his con&s;titution, put an end to his Pontificate, (September 25) the mo&s;t unfortunate, both during its continuance, and by its effects, that the church had known for many ages. The very day (Octo. 13) on which the Cardinals entered the conclave, they rai&s;ed to the Papal throne Alexander Farne&s;e, dean of the &s;acred college, and the elde&s;t member of that bo|dy, who a&s;&s;umed the name of Paul III. The account

<P>EUROPE, it is probable, owed the continuance of its peace to the death of Clement; for although no traces remain in hi&s;tory of any league concluded be|tween him and Francis, it is &s;carce to be doubted but that he would have &s;econded the operations of the French arms in Italy, that he might have gratified his ambition by &s;eeing one of his family po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;upreme power in Florence, and another in Milan. But upon the election of Paul III. who had hitherto adhered uniformly to the Imperial intere&s;t, Francis found it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;u&s;pend his operations for &s;ome time, and to put off the commencement of ho&s;tilities again&s;t the Emperor, on which he was fully deter|mined.</P>
<P>WHILE Francis waited for an opportunity to renew a war which had hitherto proved &s;o fatal to him&s;elf and his &s;ubjects, a tran&s;action of a very &s;ingular na|ture was carried on in Germany. Among many be|neficial and &s;alutary effects of which the Reformation was the immediate cau&s;e, it was attended, as mu&s;t be the ca&s;e, in all actions and events wherein men are concerned, with &s;ome con&s;equences of an oppo&s;ite nature. When the human mind is rouzed by grand objects, and agitated by &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions, its operati|ons acquire &s;uch force, that they are apt to become irregular and extravagant. Upon any great revolu|tion in religion, &s;uch irregularities abound mo&s;t, at that particular period, when men having thrown off the authority of their ancient principles, do not yet
<PB N="268" REF="011837_0670_0F9D88B1701A5C90">
fully comprehend the nature, or feel the obligation of tho&s;e new ones which they have embraced. The mind, in that &s;ituation, pu&s;hing forward with the boldne&s;s which prompted it to reject e&s;tabli&s;hed opi|nions, and not guided by a clear knowledge of the &s;y&s;tem &s;ub&s;tituted in their place, di&s;dains all re&s;traint, and runs into wild notions that often lead to &s;canda|lous or immoral conduct. Thus, in the fir&s;t ages of the Chri&s;tian church, many of the new converts, hav|ing renounced their ancient Creeds, and being but imperfectly acquainted with the doctrines and pre|cepts of Chri&s;tianity, broached the mo&s;t extravagant opinions equally &s;ubver&s;ive of piety and virtue; all which errors di&s;appeared or were exploded when the knowledge of religion increa&s;ed, and came to be more generally di&s;&s;u&s;ed. In like manner &s;oon after Luther's appearance, the ra&s;hne&s;s or ignorance of &s;ome of his di&s;ciples led them to publi&s;h ab&s;urd and pernicious te|nets, which being propo&s;ed to men extremely illite|rate, but fond of novelty, and at a time when their minds were turned wholly towards religious &s;pecula|tions, gained too ea&s;y credit and authority among them. To the&s;e cau&s;es mu&s;t be imputed the extrava|gancies of Mun&s;ter, in the year one thou&s;and five hundred and twenty-five, as well as the rapid pro|gre&s;s which they made among the pea&s;ants; but tho' the in&s;urrection excited by that Fanatic was &s;oon &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed, &s;everal of his followers lurked in different places, and endeavoured privately to propagate his opinions.</P>
<P>IN tho&s;e provinces of Upper Germany, which had already been &s;o cruelly wa&s;ted by their enthu&s;ia&s;tic rage, the magi&s;trates watched their motions with &s;uch &s;evere attention, that many of them found it nece&s;&s;ary to retire into other countries, &s;ome were puni&s;hed, others driven into exile, and their errors were entirely rooted out. But in the Netherlands and We&s;tphalia, where the pernicious tendency of their opinions was more unknown, and guarded again&s;t with le&s;s care, they got admittance into &s;everal towns, and &s;pread the infection of their principles. The mo&s;t remarkable of their religious tenets related to
<PB N="269" REF="011837_0671_0F9D88B2309FF7B0">
the Sacrament of Bapti&s;m, which as they contended, ought to be admini&s;tred only to per&s;ons grown up to years of under&s;tanding, and &s;hould be performed not by &s;prinkling them with water, but by dipping them in it: For this rea&s;on they condemned the bapti&s;m of infants, and rebaptizing all whom they admitted in|to their &s;ociety, the &s;ect came to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Anabapti&s;ts. To this peculiar notion concerning bapti&s;m, which has the appearance of be|ing founded on the practice of the church in the apo&s;|tolic age, and contains nothing incon&s;i&s;tent with the peace and order of human &s;ociety, they added other principles of a mo&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;tic, as well as dangerous nature. They maintained that, among Chri&s;tians who had the precepts of the go&s;pel to direct, and the &s;pirit of God to guide them, the office of magi&s;tracy was not only unnece&s;&s;ary, but an unlawful encroach|ment on their &s;piritual liberty; that the di&s;tinctions occa&s;ioned by birth, or rank, or wealth, being contrary to the &s;pirit of the go&s;pel, which con&s;iders all men as equal, &s;hould be entirely aboli&s;hed; that all Chri&s;tians throwing their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions into one common &s;tock, &s;hould live together in that &s;tate of equality which be|comes members of the &s;ame family; that as neither the laws of nature, nor the precepts of the New-Te&s;|tament had placed any re&s;traints upon men with re|gard to the number of wives which they might marry they &s;hould u&s;e that liberty which God him&s;elf had granted to the patriarchs.</P>
<P>SUCH opinions, propagated and maintained with enthu&s;ia&s;tic zeal and boldne&s;s, were not long of pro|ducing the violent effects natural to them. Two Ana|bapti&s;t prophets, John Matthias, a baker of Haerlem, and John Boccold, or Be&uuml;kels, a journeyman taylor of Leyden, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the rage of making pro&s;elytes, fix|ed their re&s;idence at Mun&s;ter, an Imperial city in We&s;t|phalia, of the fir&s;t rank, under the &s;overeignty of its bi&s;hop, but governed by its own &s;enate and con&s;uls. As neither of the&s;e Fanaticks wanted the talents nece&s;|&s;ary for &s;uch an undertaking, great re&s;olution, the appearance of &s;anctity, bold preten&s;ions to in&s;piration, and a confident and plau&s;ible manner of di&s;cour&s;ing,
<PB N="270" REF="011837_0672_0F9D88B2EF1E0300">
they &s;oon gained many converts. Among the&s;e were Rothman, who had fir&s;t preached the Prote&s;tant doc|trine in Mun&s;ter, and Cnipperdoling, a citizen of good birth, and con&s;iderable eminence. Emboldened by the countenance of &s;uch di&s;ciples, they openly taught their opinions; and not &s;atisfied with that liberty, they made &s;everal attempts, though without &s;ucce&s;s, to &s;eize the town, in order to get their tenets e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by publick authority. At la&s;t, having &s;ecretly called in their a&s;&s;ociates from the neighbouring coun|try, they &s;uddenly took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ar&s;enal and &s;enate-hou&s;e in the night time, and running through the &s;treets with drawn &s;words, and horrible howlings, cried out alternately, "Repent, and be baptized," and "De|part ye ungodly." The &s;enators, the canons, the no|bility, together with the more &s;ober citizens, whether Papi&s;ts or Prote&s;tants, terrified at their threats and outcries, fled in confu&s;ion, and left the city under the dominion of a frantic multitude, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of &s;trangers. Nothing now remaining to overawe or controul them, they &s;et about modelling the govern|ment according to their own wild ideas; and though at fir&s;t they &s;hewed &s;o much reverence for the ancient con&s;titution, as to elect &s;enators of their own &s;ect; and to appoint Cnipperdoling and another pro&s;elyte con|&s;uls, this was nothing more than form; for all their proceedings were directed by Matthias, who in the &s;tile, and with the authority of a prophet, uttered his commands, which it was in&s;tant death to di&s;obey. Having begun with encouraging the multitude to pil|lage the churches, and deface their ornaments; he enjoined them to de&s;troy all books except the Bible, as u&s;ele&s;s or impious; he appointed the e&s;tates of &s;uch as fled to be confi&s;cated, and &s;old to the inhabitants of the adjacent country; he ordered every man to bring forth his gold, &s;ilver, and precious effects, and to lay them at his feet; the wealth ama&s;&s;ed by the&s;e means, he depo&s;ited in a publick trea&s;ury, and named deacons to di&s;pen&s;e it for the common u&s;e of all. The mem|bers of his common-wealth being thus brought to a perfect equality, he commanded all of them to eat at ta|bles prepared in publick, and even pre&s;cribed the di&s;hes
<PB N="271" REF="011837_0673_0F9D88B3AFE083F8">
which were to be &s;erved up each day. Having fini&s;h|ed his plan of Reformation, his next care was to provide for the defence of the city; and he took mea&s;ures for that purpo&s;e with a prudence which fa|voured nothing of fanatici&s;m. He collected va&s;t maga|zines of every kind; he repaired and extended the for|tifications, obliging every per&s;on without di&s;tinction to work in his turn; he formed &s;uch as were capable of bearing arms into regular bodies, and endeavoured to add the vigour of di&s;cipline to the impetuo&s;ity of enthu&s;ia&s;m. He &s;ent emi&s;&s;aries to the Anabapti&s;ts in the Low-countries, inviting them to a&s;&s;emble at Mun|&s;ter, which he dignified with the name of Mount-Si|on, that from thence they might &s;et out to reduce all the nations of the earth under their dominion. He him&s;elf was unwearied in attending to every thing ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the &s;ecurity or increa&s;e of the &s;ect; animat|ing his di&s;ciples by his own example to refu&s;e no labour, as well as to repine at no hard&s;hip; and their enthu&s;ia&s;tic pa&s;&s;ions being kept from &s;ub&s;iding by a perpetual &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of exhortations, revelations and prophecies, they &s;eemed ready to untertake or to &s;uffer any thing in maintenance of their opinions.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, the bi&s;hop of Mun&s;ter having a&s;&s;em|bled a con&s;iderable army, advanced to be&s;iege the town. On his approach, Matthias &s;allied out at the head of &s;ome cho&s;en troops, attacked one quarter of his camp, forced it, and after great &s;laughter, return|ed to the city loaded with glory and &s;poil. Intoxica|ted with this &s;ucce&s;s, he appeared next day brandi&s;hing a &s;pear, and declared, that in imitation of Gideon, he would go forth with a handful of men and &s;mite the ho&s;t of the ungodly. Thirty per&s;ons, whom he named, fol|lowed him without he&s;itation in this wild enterprize, and ru&s;hing on the enemy with a frantic courage were cut off to a man. The death of their prophet occa&s;ion|ed at fir&s;t great con&s;ternation among his di&s;ciples, but Boccold, by the &s;ame gifts and preten&s;ions which had gained Matthias credit, &s;oon revived their &s;pirits and hopes to &s;uch a degree, that he &s;ucceeded him in the &s;ame ab&s;olute direction of all their affairs. As he did not po&s;&s;e&s;s that enterprizing courage which di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
<PB N="272" REF="011837_0674_0F9D88B471F3E338">
his predece&s;&s;or, he &s;atisfied him&s;elf with car|rying on a defen&s;ive war, and without attempting to annoy the enemy by &s;allies, he waited for the &s;uccours he expected from the Low-countries, the arrival of which was often foretold and promi&s;ed by their pro|phets. But though le&s;s daring in action than Matthi|as, he was a wilder enthu&s;ia&s;t, and of more unbound|ed ambition. Soon after the death of his predece&s;&s;or, having by ob&s;cure vi&s;ions, and prophe&s;ies, prepared the multitude for &s;ome extraordinary event, he &s;trip|ped him&s;elf naked, and marching through the &s;treets, proclaimed with a loud voice, "That the kingdom of Sion was at hand; that whatever was highe&s;t on earth &s;hould be brought low, and whatever was lowe&s;t &s;hould be exalted." In order to fulfil this, he com|manded the churches, as the mo&s;t lofty buildings in the city, to be levelled with the ground; he degrad|ed the &s;enators cho&s;en by Matthias, and depriving Cnipperdoling of the con&s;ul&s;hip, the highe&s;t office in the commonwealth, he appointed him to execute the the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t infamous, that of common hang|man, to which &s;trange tran&s;ition the other agreed, not only without murmuring, but with the utmo&s;t joy; and &s;uch was the de&s;poti&s;m and rigour of Boc|cold's admini&s;tration, that he was called almo&s;t every day to perform &s;ome duty or other of his wretched function. In place of the depo&s;ed &s;enators, he named twelve judges, according to the number of tribes in I&s;rael, to pre&s;ide in all affairs; retaining to him&s;elf the &s;ame authority which Mo&s;es anciently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed as legi&s;lator of that people.</P>
<P>NOT &s;atisfied, however, with power or titles which were not &s;upreme, a prophet, whom he had gained and tutored, having called the multitude to|gether, declared it to be the will of God, that John Boccold &s;hould be King of Sion, and &s;it on the throne of David. John kneeling down, accepted of the heavenly call, which he &s;olemnly prote&s;ted had been revealed likewi&s;e to him&s;elf, and was immediately ac|knowledged as Monarch by the deluded multitude, (June 24). From that moment he a&s;&s;umed all the &s;tate and pomp of royalty. He wore a crown of gold,
<PB N="273" REF="011837_0675_0F9D88B531CE1B58">
and the riche&s;t and mo&s;t &s;umptuous garments. A Bi|ble was carried on his one hand, a naked &s;word on the other. A great body of guards accompanied him when he appeared in publick. He coined money &s;tamped with his own image, and appointed the great officers of his hou&s;hold and kingdom, among whom Cnipperdoling was nominated governor of the city, as a reward for his former &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>HAVING now attained the heighth of power, Boc|cold began to di&s;cover pa&s;&s;ions, which he had hitherto re&s;trained or indulged only in &s;ecret. As the exce&s;&s;es of enthu&s;ia&s;m have been ob&s;erved in every age to lead to &s;en&s;ual gratifications, the &s;ame con&s;titution that is &s;u&s;ceptible of the former, being remarkably prone to the latter, he in&s;tructed the prophets and teachers to harrangue the people for &s;everal days concerning the lawfulne&s;s, and even nece&s;&s;ity of taking more wives than one, which they a&s;&s;erted to be one of the privi|leges granted by God to the &s;aints. When their ears were once accu&s;tomed to this licentious doctrine, and their pa&s;&s;ions inflamed with the pro&s;pect of &s;uch un|bounded indulgence, he him&s;elf &s;et them an example of u&s;ing what he called their Chri&s;tian liberty, by marrying at once three wives, among which the wi|dow of Matthias, a woman of &s;ingular beauty was one. As he was allured by beauty, or the love of va|riety, he gradually added to the number of his wives until they amounted to fourteen, though the widow of Matthias was the only one dignified with the title of Queen, or who &s;hared with him the &s;plendour and ornaments of royalty. After the example of their prophet, the multitude gave them&s;elves up to the mo&s;t licentious and uncontrouled gratification of their de|&s;ires. No man remained &s;atisfied with a &s;ingle wife. Not to u&s;e their Chri&s;tian liberty was deemed a crime. Per&s;ons were appointed to &s;earch the hou&s;es for young women grown up to maturity, whom they in&s;tantly compelled to marry. Together with polygamy, free|dom of divorce, its in&s;eparable attendant, was intro|duced, and became a new &s;ource of corruption. Eve|ry exce&s;s was committed, of which the pa&s;&s;ions of men are capable, when re&s;trained neither by the au|thority

<P>MEANWHILE, the German princes were highly of|fended at the in&s;ult offered to their dignity by Boc|cold's pre&s;umptuous u&s;urpation of royal honours; and the profligate manners of his followers, which were a reproach to the Chri&s;tian name, filled men of all pro|fe&s;&s;ions with horror. Luther, who had te&s;tified again&s;t this fanatical &s;pirit on its fir&s;t appearance, now deeply lamented its progre&s;s, and expo&s;ing the delu&s;i|on with great &s;trength of argument, as well as acri|mony of &s;tile, called loudly on all the &s;tates of Germany to put a &s;top to a phren&s;y no le&s;s pernicious to &s;ociety, than fatal to religion. The Emperor, occupied with other cares and projects, had no lei&s;ure to attend to &s;uch a di&s;tant object. But the princes of the Empire, a&s;&s;embled by the King of the Romans, voted a &s;upply of men and money to the bi&s;hop of Mun&s;ter, who be|ing unable to keep a &s;ufficient army on foot, had con|verted the &s;iege of the town into a blockade. The forces rai&s;ed in con&s;equence of this re&s;olution, were put under the command of an officer of experience, who approaching the town towards the end of &s;pring in the year one thou&s;and five hundred and thirty-five, pre&s;&s;ed it more clo&s;ely than formerly, but found the fortifications &s;o &s;trong, and &s;o diligently guarded, that he dur&s;t not attempt an a&s;&s;ault. It was now above fifteen months &s;ince the Anabapti&s;ts had e&s;ta|bli&s;hed their dominion in Mun&s;ter; they had during that time undergone prodigious fatigue in working on the fortifications, and performing military duty. Notwith&s;tanding the prudent attention of their King

to provide for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and his frugal and regular oeconomy in their publick meals, they began to feel the approach of famine. Several &s;mall bodies of their brethren, who were advancing to their a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance from the Low-Countries, had been intercepted, and cut to pieces; and while all Germany was ready to combine again&s;t them, they had no pro&s;pect of &s;uc|cour. But &s;uch was the a&s;cendant which Boccold had acquired over the multitude, and &s;o powerful the fa&s;cination of enthu&s;ia&s;m, that their hopes were as &s;an|guine as ever, and they hearkened withimplicit credulity to the vi&s;ions and predictions of their prophets, which a&s;&s;ured them, that the Almighty would &s;peedily inter|po&s;e, in order to deliver the city. The faith, however, of &s;ome few, &s;haken by the violence and length of their &s;ufferings, began to fail; but being &s;u&s;pected of an inclination to &s;urrender to the enemy, they were puni&s;hed with immediate death, as guilty of impiety in di&s;tru&s;ting the power of God. One of the King's wives, having uttered certain words that implied &s;ome doubt concerning his divine mi&s;&s;ion, he in&s;tantly called the whole number together, and commanding the bla&s;phemer, as he called her, to kneel down, cut off her head with his own hands; and &s;o far were the re&s;t from expre&s;&s;ing any horror at this cruel deed, that they joined him in dancing with a frantick joy around the bleeding body of their companion.</P>
<P>BY this time, the be&s;ieged endured the utmo&s;t ri|gour of famine; (June 1.) but they cho&s;e rather to &s;uf|fer hard&s;hips, the recital of which is &s;hocking to hu|manity, than to li&s;ten to the terms of capitulation of|fered them by the bi&s;hop. At la&s;t, a de&s;erter, whom they had taken into their &s;ervice, being either le&s;s in|toxicated with the fumes of enthu&s;ia&s;m, or unable any longer to bear &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s, made his e&s;cape to the enemy. He informed their general of a weak part in the fortifications which he had ob&s;erved, and a&s;&s;uring him that the be&s;ieged, exhau&s;ted with hun|ger and fatigue, kept watch there with little care, he offered to lead a party thither in the night. The pro|po&s;al was accepted, and a cho&s;en body of troops ap|pointed for the &s;ervice; who, &s;caling the walls unper|ceived,

&s;eized one of the gates, and admitted the re&s;t of the army (June 24). The Anabapti&s;ts, though &s;urprized, defended them&s;elves in the market place with valour, heightened by de&s;pair; but being over-powered by numbers, and &s;urrounded on every hand, mo&s;t of them were &s;lain, and the remainder taken pri&s;oners. Among the la&s;t were the King and Cnip|perdoling. The King, loaded with chains, was car|ried from city to city as a &s;pectacle to gratify the curio|&s;ity of the people, and was expo&s;ed to all their in&s;ults. His &s;pirit, however, was not broken or humbled by this &s;ad rever&s;e of his condition; and he adhered with un&s;haken firmne&s;s to the di&s;tingui&s;hing tenets of his &s;ect. After this, he was brought back to Mun&s;ter, the &s;cene of his royalty and crimes, and put to death with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite and lingering tortures, all which he bore with a&s;toni&s;hing fortitude.

<P><PB N="277" REF="011837_0679_0F9D88B832D26BF8">THE mutiny of the Anabapti&s;ts, though it drew general attention, did not &s;o entirely engro&s;s the prin|ces of Germany, as not to allow lei&s;ure for other tran&s;actions. The alliance between the French King and the confederates at Smalkalde, began about this time to produce great effects. Ulric, Duke of Wur|temberg, having been expelled his dominions in the year one thou&s;and five hundred and nineteen, on ac|count of his violent and oppre&s;&s;ive admini&s;tration, the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria had got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his dutchy. That prince having now by along exile atoned for the errors in his conduct, which were the effect rather of inexperience than of a tyrannical di&s;po&s;ition, was be|come the object of general compa&s;&s;ion. The Land|grave of He&s;&s;e, in particular, his near relation, warm|ly e&s;pou&s;ed his intere&s;t, and u&s;ed many efforts to re|cover for him his ancient inheritance. But the king of the Romans ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed to relinqui&s;h a va|luable acqui&s;ition which his family had made with &s;o much ea&s;e. The Landgrave, unable to compel him, applied to the King of France his new ally. Francis, eager to embrace any opportunity of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, and de&s;irous of wre&s;ting from it a territory, which gave it footing and influence in a part of Germany at a di&s;tance from its other domini|ons, encouraged the Landgrave to take arms, and &s;e|cretly &s;upplied him with a large &s;um of money. This he employed to rai&s;e troops, and marching with great expedition towards Wurtemberg, attacked, defeated, and di&s;per&s;ed a con&s;iderable body of Au&s;trians, en|tru&s;ted with the defence of the country. All the Duke's &s;ubjects ha&s;tened, with emulation, to receive their native Prince, and re-inve&s;ted him with that au|thority which is &s;till enjoyed by his defendants. At the &s;ame time the exerci&s;e of the Prote&s;tant religion was e&s;tabli&s;hed in his dominions <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 172. Bellay, 159, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FERDINAND, how &s;en&s;ible &s;oever of this unexpect|ed blow, not daring to attack a prince whom all the Prote&s;tant powers in Germany were ready to &s;upport,
<PB N="278" REF="011837_0680_0F9D88B8EFD210C0">
judged it expedient to conclude a treaty with him, by which he recognized in the mo&s;t ample form his title to the dutchy. The &s;ucce&s;s of the Landgrave's operations in behalf of the duke of Wurtemberg, hav|ing convinced Ferdinand that a rupture with a league &s;o formidable as that of Smalkalde, was to be avoided with the utmo&s;t care, he entered likewi&s;e into a ne|gociation with the Elector of Saxony, the head of that union, and by &s;ome conce&s;&s;ions in favour of the Pro|te&s;tant religion, and others of advantage to the Elec|tor him&s;elf, he prevailed on him, together with his confederates to acknowledge his title as King of the Ro|mans. At the &s;ame time, in order to prevent any &s;uch precipitate or irregular election in times to come, it was agreed that no per&s;ons &s;hould hereafter be promoted to that dignity without the unanimous con&s;ent of the Electors; and the Emperor &s;oon after confirmed this &s;tipulation <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 173.

<P>THESE acts of indulgence towards the Prote&s;tants, and the clo&s;e union into which the King of the Ro|mans &s;eemed to be entering with the Princes of that party, gave great offence at Rome. Paul III. though he had departed from a re&s;olution of his predece&s;&s;or, never to con&s;ent to the calling of a general council, and had promi&s;ed in the fir&s;t con&s;i&s;tory held after his election, that he would convoke that a&s;&s;embly &s;o much de&s;ired by all Chri&s;tendom, was no le&s;s enraged than Clement at the innovations in Germany, and no le&s;s aver&s;e to any &s;chemes for reforming either the doctrines of the church, or the abu&s;es in the court of Rome: But having been a witne&s;s of the univer&s;al cen&s;ure which Clement had incurred by his ob&s;tinacy with regard to the&s;e points, he hoped to avoid the &s;ame reproach by the &s;eeming alacrity with which he propo&s;ed a council; flattering him&s;elf, however, that &s;uch difficulties would ari&s;e concerning the time and place of meeting, the per&s;ons who had a right to be pre&s;ent, and the order of their proceedings, as would effectually defeat the intention of tho&s;e who demand|ed that a&s;&s;embly, without expo&s;ing him&s;elf to any

imputation for refu&s;ing to call it. With this view he di&s;patched nuncios to the &s;everal courts, in order to make known his intention, and that he had fixed on Mantua as a proper place in which to hold the coun|cil. Such difficulties as the Pope had fore&s;een, im|mediately pre&s;ented them&s;elves in great number. The French King did not approve of the place which Paul had cho&s;en, as the Papal and imperial influence would nece&s;&s;arily be too great in a town &s;ituated in that part of Italy. The King of England not only concurred with Francis in urging that objection, but refu&s;ed, be&s;ides, to acknowledge any council called in the name and by the authority of the Pope (Dec. 12). The German Prote&s;tants having met together at Smalkalde, in&s;i&s;ted on their original demand of a council to be held in Germany, and pleading the Em|peror's promi&s;e, as well as the agreement at Rati&s;bon to that effect, declared that they would not con&s;ider an a&s;&s;embly held at Mantua as a legal or free repre&s;en|tative of the church. By this diver&s;ity of &s;entiments and views, &s;uch a field for intrigue and negociation opened, as made it ea&s;y for the Pope to a&s;&s;ume the merit of being eager to a&s;&s;emble a council, while at the &s;ame time he could put off its meeting at plea&s;ure. The Prote&s;tants on the other hand &s;u&s;pecting his de|&s;igns, and &s;en&s;ible of the importance which they deriv|ed from their union, renewed for ten years the lea|gue of Smalkalde, which now became &s;tronger and more formidable by the acce&s;&s;ion of &s;everal new members <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">This league was concluded December, one thou&s;and five hundred and thirty five, but not extended or &s;igned in form till September in the following year.

&s;ea, which anciently formed the kingdoms of Mauri|tania and Ma&s;&s;ylia, together with the republick of Carthage, and which is now known by the general name of Barbary, had undergone many revolutions. Subdued by the Romans, it became a province of their empire. Conquered afterwards by the Vandals, they erected a kingdom there. That being overturn|ed by Beli&s;arius, the country continued &s;ubject to the Greek Emperors, until it was over-run towards the end of the &s;eventh century, by the rapid and irre&s;i&s;ta|ble arms of the Arabs. It remained for &s;ometime a part of that va&s;t empire of which the Caliphs were the head. Its immen&s;e di&s;tance, however, from the &s;eat of government, encouraged the de&s;cendants of tho&s;e leaders, who had &s;ubdued the country, or the chiefs of the Moors, its ancient inhabitants, to throw off the yoke, and to &s;et up for independance. The Caliphs, who derived their authority from a &s;pirit of enthu&s;ia&s;m, more fitted for making conque&s;ts than for pre&s;erving them, were obliged to connive at acts of rebellion which they could not prevent; and Barbary was divided into &s;everal kingdoms, of which Moroc|co, Algiers and Tunis were the mo&s;t con&s;iderable. The inhabitants of the&s;e kingdoms were a mixed race, Arabs, Negroes from the &s;outhern provinces, and Moors, either natives of Africa, or who had been ex|pelled out of Spain; all zealous profe&s;&s;ors of the Ma|hometan religion, and inflamed again&s;t Chri&s;tianity with a bigotted hatred proportional to their ignorance and barbarous manners.</P>
<P>AMONG the&s;e people, no le&s;s daring, incon&s;tant and treacherous, than the ancient inhabitants of the &s;ame country de&s;cribed by the Roman hi&s;torians, frequent &s;editions broke out, and many changes in govern|ment took place. The&s;e, as they affected only the in|ternal &s;tate of a country &s;o barbarous are but little known, and de&s;erve to be &s;o. But about the begin|ning of the &s;ixteenth century a &s;udden revolution hap|pened, which by rendering the &s;tates of Barbary for|midable to the Europeans, hath made their hi&s;tory worthy of more attention. This revolution was brought about by per&s;ons born in a rank of life which

entitled them to act no &s;uch illu&s;trious part. Horuc and Hayradin, the &s;ons of a potter in the i&s;le of Le&s;bos, prompted by a re&s;tle&s;s and enterprizing &s;pirit, for|&s;ook their father's trade, ran to &s;ea, and joined a crew of pirates. They &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by their valour and activity, and becoming ma&s;ters of a &s;mall brigantine, carried on their infamous trade with &s;uch conduct and &s;ucce&s;s, that they a&s;&s;embled a fleet of twelve galleys, be&s;ides many ve&s;&s;els of &s;maller force. Of this fleet Horuc, the elder brother, called Barba|ro&s;&s;a from the red colour of his beard, was admiral, and Hayradin &s;econd in command, but with almo&s;t equal authority. They called them&s;elves the friends of the &s;ea, and the enemies of all who &s;ail upon it; and their names &s;oon became terrible from the Straits of the Dardanelles to tho&s;e of Gibraltar. Together with their fame and power, their ambitious views opened and enlarged, and while acting as Cor&s;airs they adopt|ed the ideas, and acquired the talents of conquerors. They often carried the prizes which they took on the coa&s;ts of Spain and Italy into the ports of Bar|bary, and enriching the inhabitants by the &s;ale of their booty, and the thoughtle&s;s prodigality of their crews, were welcome gue&s;ts in every place at which they touched. The convenient &s;ituation of the&s;e harbours lying &s;o near the greate&s;t commercial &s;tates at that time in Chri&s;tendom, made the brothers wi&s;h for an e&s;tabli&s;hment in that country. An opportunity of ac|compli&s;hing this quickly pre&s;ented it&s;elf, which they did not &s;uffer to pa&s;s unimproved. Eutemi, King of Algiers, having attempted &s;everal times, without &s;uc|ce&s;s, to take a fort which the Spani&s;h governors of Oran had built not far from his capital, was &s;o ill ad|vi&s;ed as to apply for aid to Barbaro&s;&s;a, who&s;e valour the Africans con&s;idered as irre&s;i&s;tible. The active Cor&s;air gladly accepted of the invitation, and leaving his brother Hayradin with the fleet, marched at the head of five thou&s;and men to Algiers, where he was received as their deliverer. Such a force gave him the command of the town; and ob&s;erving that the Moors neither &s;u&s;pected him of any bad in|tention, nor were capable with their light-armed
<PB N="282" REF="011837_0684_0F9D88BBEFA92818">
troops of oppo&s;ing his di&s;ciplined veterans, he &s;ecretly murdered the Monarch whom he had come to a&s;&s;i&s;t, and cau&s;ed him&s;elf to be proclaimed King of Algiers in his &s;tead. The authority which he had thus boldly u&s;urped, he endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h by arts &s;uited to the genius of the people whom he had to govern; by liberality, without bounds to tho&s;e who favoured his promotion, and by cruelty no le&s;s unbounded towards all whom he had any rea&s;on to di&s;tru&s;t. Not &s;atisfied with the throne which he had acquired, he attacked the neighbouring King of Tremecen, and having van|qui&s;hed him in battle, added his dominions to tho&s;e of Algiers. At the &s;ame time, he continued to infe&s;t the coa&s;ts of Spain and Italy with fleets which re&s;em|bled the armaments of a great Monarch, rather than the light &s;quadrons of a Cor&s;air. The deva&s;tations which the&s;e committed obliged Charles about the be|ginning of his reign, to furni&s;h the marquis de Co|mares, governor of Oran, with troops &s;ufficient to at|tack him. That officer, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the dethroned King of Tremecen, executed the commi&s;&s;ion with &s;uch &s;pirit, that Barbaro&s;&s;a's troops being beat in &s;eve|ral encounters, he him&s;elf was &s;hut up in Tremecen; after defending it to the la&s;t extremity, he was over|taken in attempting to make his e&s;cape, and &s;lain while he fought with an ob&s;tinate valour, worthy of his former fame and exploits.</P>
<P>HIS brother Hayradin, known likewi&s;e by the name of Barbaro&s;&s;a, a&s;&s;umed the &s;cepter of Algiers with the &s;ame ambition and abilities, but with better fortune. His reign being undi&s;turbed by the arms of the Spaniards, which had full occupation in the wars among the European powers, he regulated with ad|mirable prudence the interior police of his kingdom, carried on his naval operations with great vigour, and extended his conque&s;ts on the continent of Africa. But, perceiving that the Moors and Arabs &s;ubmitted to his government with the utmo&s;t impatience, and being afraid that his continual depredations would, one day, draw upon him the arms of the Chri&s;tians, he put his dominions under the protection of the Grand Seignior, and received from him a body of Turki&s;h
<PB N="283" REF="011837_0685_0F9D88BCB6ED18A0">
&s;oldiers &s;ufficient for his &s;ecurity again&s;t his dome&s;tic as well as his foreign enemies. At la&s;t, the &s;ame of his exploits daily increa&s;ing, Solyman offered him the command of the Turki&s;h fleet, as the only per&s;on who&s;e valour and &s;kill in naval affairs entitled him to command again&s;t Andrew Doria, the greate&s;t &s;ea-offi|cer of that age. Proud of this di&s;tinction, Barbaro&s;&s;a repaired to Con&s;tantinople, and with a wonderful ver&s;atility of mind, mingling the arts of a courtier with the boldne&s;s of a Cor&s;air, gained the entire con|fidence both of the Sultan and his Vizier. To them he communicated a &s;cheme that he had formed of making him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Tunis, the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing kingdom, at that time, on the coa&s;t of Africa; which being approved of by them, he obtained whatever he demanded for carrying it into execution.</P>
<P>HIS hopes of &s;ucce&s;s in this undertaking were founded on the inte&s;tine divi&s;ions in the kingdom of Tunis. Mahmed, the la&s;t King of that country, hav|ing thirty-four &s;ons by different wives, named Mu|ley-Ha&s;cen, one of the younge&s;t among them, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. That weak Prince, who owed his prefe|rence not to his own merit, but to the a&s;cendant which his mother had acquired over an old doating monarch, fir&s;t poi&s;oned his father in order to prevent him from altering his de&s;tination; and then, with the babarous policy which prevails wherever polygamy is permit|ted, and the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is not preci&s;ely fixed, he put to death all his brothers whom he could get into his power. Alra&s;chid, one of the elde&s;t, was &s;o fortunate as to e&s;cape his rage; and finding a retreat among the wandering Arabs, made &s;everal attempts, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome of their chiefs, to recover the throne, which of right belonged to him. But the&s;e proving un&s;ucce&s;sful, and the Arabs, from their na|tural levity, being ready to deliver him up to his mer|cile&s;s brother, he fled to Algiers, the only place of re|fuge remaining, and implored the protection of Bar|baro&s;&s;a; who, di&s;cerning at once all the advantages that might be gained by &s;upporting his title, received him with every po&s;&s;ible demon&s;tration of friend&s;hip and re&s;pect. Being ready, at that time, to &s;et &s;ail for
<PB N="284" REF="011837_0686_0F9D88BD6F6C6950">
Con&s;tantinople, he ea&s;ily per&s;uaded Alra&s;chid, who&s;e eagerne&s;s to obtain a crown di&s;po&s;ed him to believe or undertake, any thing, to accompany him thither, pro|mi&s;ing him effectual a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Solyman, whom he repre&s;ented to be the mo&s;t generous, as well as mo&s;t powerful Monarch in the world. But no &s;ooner were they arrived at Con&s;tantinople, than the fal&s;e Cor&s;air, regardle&s;s of all his promi&s;es to him, opened to the Sultan a plan for conquering Tunis, and annex|ing it to the Turki&s;h empire, by making u&s;e of the name of this exiled Prince, and by means of the party ready to declare in his favour. Solyman approved with too much facility, of this per&s;idious propo&s;al, ex|tremely &s;uitable to the character of its author, but al|together unworthy of a great Prince. A powerful fleet and numerous army were &s;oon a&s;&s;embled; at the &s;ight of which the credulous Alra&s;chid flattered him|&s;elf, that he would &s;oon enter his capital in triumph.</P>
<P>BUT ju&s;t as this unhappy Prince was going to em|bark, he was arre&s;ted by order of the Sultan, &s;hut up in the &s;eraglio, and was never heard of more. Bar|baro&s;&s;a &s;ailed with a fleet of two hundred and fifty ve&s;|&s;els towards Africa. After ravaging the coa&s;ts of Italy, and &s;preading terror through every part of that country, he appeared before Tunis; and landing his men, gave out that he came to a&s;&s;ert the right of Al|ra&s;chid, whom he pretended to have left &s;ick on board the Admiral galley. The &s;ort of Goletta which com|mands the bay, &s;oon fell into his hands, partly by his own addre&s;s, partly by the treachery of its command|er; and the inhabitants of Tunis, weary of Muley-Ha&s;cen's government, took arms, and declared for Alra&s;chid with &s;uch zeal and unanimity, as obliged the former to fly &s;o precipitately, that he left all his trea&s;ures behind him. The gates were immediately &s;et open to Barbaro&s;&s;a, as the re&s;torer of their lawful &s;overeign. But when Alra&s;chid him&s;elf did not ap|pear, and when in&s;tead of his name, that of Solyman alone was heard among the acclamations of the Turk|i&s;h &s;oldiers marching into the town, the people of Tunis began to &s;u&s;pect the Cor&s;air's treachery; and their &s;u&s;picions being &s;oon converted into certainty,
<PB N="285" REF="011837_0687_0F9D88BE2F463028">
they ran to arms with the utmo&s;t fury, and &s;urrounded the citadel, into which Barbaro&s;&s;a had led his troops. But having fore&s;een &s;uch a revolution, he was not un|prepared for it; he immediately turned again&s;t them the artillery on the ramparts, and by one bri&s;k di&s;|charge of it, and of his &s;mall arms, he di&s;per&s;ed the numerous but undirected a&s;&s;ailants, and forced them to acknowledge Solyman as their &s;overeign, and to &s;ubmit to him&s;elf as his viceroy.</P>
<P>HIS fir&s;t care was to put the kingdom of which he had thus got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, in a proper po&s;ture of defence. He &s;trengthened the citadel which commands the town; and fortifying the Goletta in a regular manner at va&s;t expence, made it the principal &s;tation for his fleet, and his great ar&s;enal both for military and na|val &s;tores. Being now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch exten&s;ive ter|ritories, he carried on his depredations again&s;t the Chri&s;tian &s;tates to a greater extent, and with more de&s;tructive violence than ever. Daily complaints of the outrages committed by his cruizers were brought to the Emperor by his &s;ubjects, both in Spain and Ita|ly. All Chri&s;tendom &s;eemed to expect from him, as its greate&s;t and mo&s;t fortunate Prince, that he would put an end to this new and odious &s;pecies of oppre&s;&s;i|on. At the &s;ame time Muley-Ha&s;cen, the exiled king of Tunis, finding none of the Mahometan Princes in Africa willing or able to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in recovering his throne, applied to Charles as the only per&s;on who could a&s;&s;ert his rights in oppo&s;ition to &s;uch a formida|ble u&s;urper. The Emperor, equally de&s;irous of deli|vering his dominions from the dangerous neigbour|hood of Barbaro&s;&s;a; of appearing as the protector of an unfortunate Prince; and of acquiring the glory annexed in that age, to every expedition again&s;t the Mahometans, readily concluded a treaty with Muley-Ha&s;cen, (April 21, 1553) and began to prepare for in|vading Tunis. Having made trial of his own abilities for war in the late campaign in Hungary, he was now become &s;o fond of the military character, that he de|termined to command on this occa&s;ion in per&s;on. The united &s;trength of his dominions was called out upon an enterprize in which the Emperor was about to ha|zard
<PB N="286" REF="011837_0688_0F9D88BEF15107D0">
his glory, and which drew the attention of all Europe. A Flemi&s;h fleet carried from the ports of the Low-Country a body of German infantry <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Hardi Annales Brabant. i 599.</NOTE>; the gallies of Naples and Sicily took on board the veteran bands of Italians and Spaniards, which had di&s;tin|gui&s;hed them&s;elves by &s;o many victories over the French; the Emperor him&s;elf embarked at Barcelona with the flower of the Spani&s;h nobility, and was join|ed by a con&s;iderable &s;quadron from Portugal, under the command of the Infant Don Lewis, the Empre&s;s's brother; Andrew Doria conducted his own gallies, the be&s;t appointed at that time in Europe, and command|ed by the mo&s;t &s;kilful officers: the Pope furni&s;hed all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his power towards &s;uch a pious enter|prize; and the order of Malta, the perpetual enemies of the Infidels, equipped a &s;mall &s;quadron, but for|midable by the valour of the knights who &s;erved on board it. The port of Cagliari in Sardinia was the general place of rendezvous. Doria was appointed High Admiral of the fleet; the command in chief of the land forces was given to the marquis di Gua&s;to.</P>
<P>ON the &s;ixteenth of July, the fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of near five hundred ve&s;&s;els, having on board above thir|ty thou&s;and regular troops, &s;et &s;ail from Cagliari, and after a pro&s;perous navigation, landed within &s;ight of Tunis. Barbaro&s;&s;a having early intelligence of the Emperor's immen&s;e armament, and &s;u&s;pecting its de&s;tination, prepared with equal prudence and vigour for the defence of his new conque&s;t. He called in all his cor&s;airs from their different &s;tations; he drew from Algiers what forces could be &s;pared; he di&s;patched me&s;&s;engers to all the African Princes, Moors as well as Arabs, and by repre&s;enting Muley-Ha&s;cen as an infamous apo&s;tate, prompted by ambition and revenge not only to become the va&s;&s;al of a Chri&s;tian Prince, but to con&s;pire with him to extirpate the Mahomedan faith, he enflamed tho&s;e ignorant and bigotted chiefs to &s;uch a degree, that they took arms as in a common cau&s;e. Twenty thou&s;and hor&s;e together with a va&s;t body of foot, &s;oon a&s;&s;embled at Tunis; and Barbaro&s;|&s;a, by a proper di&s;tribution of pre&s;ents among them from time to time, kept the ardour which had bro't
<PB N="287" REF="011837_0689_0F9D88C03B6BF5B8">
them together from &s;ub&s;iding. But as he was too well acquainted with the enemy whom he had to op|po&s;e, to think that the&s;e light troops could re&s;i&s;t the heavy armed cavalry and veteran infantry which com|po&s;ed the Imperial army, his chief confidence was in the &s;trength of the Goletta, and in his body of Turk|i&s;h &s;oldiers who were armed and di&s;ciplined after the European fa&s;hion. Six thou&s;and of the&s;e, under the command of Sinan, a renegado Jew, the brave&s;t and mo&s;t experienced of all his cor&s;airs, he threw into that fort, which the Emperor immediately inve&s;ted. As Charles had the command of the &s;ea, his camp was &s;o plentifully &s;upplied not only with the nece&s;&s;aries, but with all the luxuries of life, that Muley-Ha&s;cen, who had not been accu&s;tomed to &s;ee war carried on with &s;uch order and magnificence, was filled with admira|tion of the Emperor's power. His troops animated by his pre&s;ence, and con&s;idering it as meritorious to &s;hed their blood in &s;uch a pious cau&s;e, contended with each other for the po&s;ts of honour and danger. Three &s;eparate attacks were concerted, and the Germans, Spaniards and Italians, having one of the&s;e commit|ted to each of them, pu&s;hed them forward with the eager courage which national emulation in&s;pires. Si|nan di&s;played re&s;olution and &s;kill becoming the confi|dence which his ma&s;ter had put in him; the garri&s;on performed the hard &s;ervice on which they were or|dered with great fortitude. But though he inter|rupted the be&s;iegers by frequent &s;allies; though the Moors and Arabs alarmed the camp with their conti|nual incur&s;ions; the breaches &s;oon became &s;o con&s;ide|rable towards the land, while the fleet battered the fortifications which it could approach, with no le&s;s fury and &s;ucce&s;s, that an a&s;&s;ault being given on all &s;ides at once, the place was taken by &s;torm (July 25). Sinan, with the remains of his garri&s;on, retiring, after an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, over a &s;hallow part of the bay towards the city. By the reduction of the Goletta, the Emperor became ma&s;ter of Barbaro&s;&s;a's fleet, con|&s;i&s;ting of eighty-&s;even gallies and galliots, together with his ar&s;enal, and three hundred cannon mo&s;tly bra&s;s, which were planted on the ramparts; a prodi|gious
<PB N="288" REF="011837_0690_0F9D89F05CB1C788">
number in that age, and a remarkable proof of the &s;trength of the fort, as well as of the greatne&s;s of the cor&s;air's power, The Emperor marched into the Goletta through the breach, and turning to Muley-Ha&s;cen who attended him, "Here," &s;ays he, <Q>is a gate open to you, by which you &s;hall return to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your dominions.</Q></P>
<P>BARBAROSSA, though he felt the full weight of the blow which he had received, did not, however, lo&s;e courage, or abandon the defence of Tunis. But as the walls were of great extent, and extremely weak; as he could not depend on the fidelity of the inhabi|tants, nor hope that the Moors and Arabs would &s;u&s;|tain the hard&s;hips of a &s;iege, he boldly determined to advance with his army, which amounted to fifty thou&s;and men <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Epi&s;tres de Princes, par Ru&s;celli, p. 119, &amp;c.</NOTE>, towards the Imperial camp, and to decide the fate of his kingdom by the i&s;&s;ue of a battle. This re&s;olution he communicated to his principal offi|cers, and repre&s;enting to them the fatal con&s;equences which might follow, if ten thou&s;and Chri&s;tian &s;laves, whom he had &s;hut up in the citadel, &s;hould attempt to mutiny during the ab&s;ence of the army, he propo&s;|ed as a nece&s;&s;ary precaution for the public &s;ecurity, to ma&s;&s;acre them without mercy before he began his march. They all approved warmly of his intention to fight; but inured as they were, in their piratical depredations, to &s;cenes of blood&s;hed and cruelty, the barbarity of his propo&s;al concerning the &s;laves filled them with horror; and Barbaro&s;&s;a, rather from the dread of irritating them, than &s;wayed by motives of humanity, con&s;ented to &s;pare the lives of the &s;laves.</P>
<P>BY this time the Emperor had begun to advance towards Tunis; and though his troops &s;uffered in|conceivable hard&s;hips in their march over burning &s;ands, de&s;titute of water, and expo&s;ed to the intolera|ble heat of the &s;un, they &s;oon came up with the enemy. The Moors and Arabs, emboldened by their va&s;t &s;u|periority in number, immediately ru&s;hed on to the attack with loud &s;houts, but their undi&s;ciplined cou|rage did not &s;tand one moment the &s;hock of regular
<PB N="289" REF="011837_0691_0F9D89F13537DEF0">
battalions; and though Barbaro&s;&s;a, with admirable pre&s;ence of mind, and by expo&s;ing his own per&s;on to the greate&s;t dangers, endeavoured to rally them, the rout became &s;o general, that he him&s;elf was hurried along with them in their flight back to the city. There he found every thing in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion; &s;ome of the inhabitants flying with their families and effects; others ready to &s;et open their gates to the conqueror; the Turki&s;h &s;oldiers preparing to retreat; and the citadel, which in &s;uch circum&s;tances might have afforded him &s;ome refuge, already in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on of the Chri&s;tian captives. The&s;e unhappy men, rendered de&s;perate by their &s;ituation, had laid hold on the opportunity which Barbaro&s;&s;a dreaded. As &s;oon as his army was at &s;ome di&s;tance from the town, they gained two of their keepers, by who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance, knocking off their fetters, and bur&s;ting open their pri&s;ons, they overpowered the Turki&s;h garri&s;on, and turned the artillery of the fort again&s;t their former ma&s;ters. Barbaro&s;&s;a, di&s;appointed and enraged, ex|claimed &s;ometimes again&s;t the fal&s;e compa&s;&s;ion of his officers, and &s;ometimes condemning his own impru|dent compliance with their opinion, fled precipitate|ly to Bona.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE Charles, &s;atisfied with the ea&s;y and almo&s;t bloodle&s;s victory which he had gained, and ad|vancing &s;lowly with the precaution nece&s;&s;ary in an enemy's country, did not yet know the whole extent of his own good fortune. But at la&s;t, a me&s;&s;enger di&s;patched by the &s;laves acquainted him with the &s;uc|ce&s;s of their noble effort for the recovery of their li|berty; and at the &s;ame time deputies arrived from the town, in order to pre&s;ent him the keys of their gates, and to implore his protection from military violence. While he was deliberating concerning the proper mea|&s;ures for this purpo&s;e, the &s;oldiers fearing that they would be deprived of the booty which they had ex|pected, broke &s;uddenly, and without orders, into the town, and began to kill and plunder without di&s;|tinction. It was then too late to re&s;train their cruelty, their avarice, or licentiou&s;ne&s;s. All the outrages of which &s;oldiers are capable in the fury of a &s;torm, all

the exce&s;&s;es of which men can be guilty when their pa&s;&s;ions are heightened by the contempt and hatred which difference in manners and religion in&s;pire, were committed. Above thirty thou&s;and of the innocent inhabitants peri&s;hed on that unhappy day, and ten thou&s;and were carried away as &s;laves. Muley-Ha&s;cen took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a throne &s;urrounded with carnage, abhorred by this &s;ubjects on whom he had brought &s;uch calamities, and pitied even by tho&s;e who&s;e ra&s;h|ne&s;s had been the occa&s;ion of them. The Emperor lamented the fatal accident which had &s;tained the lu&s;tre of his victory; and amid&s;t &s;uch a &s;cene of horror there was but one &s;pectacle that afforded him any &s;a|tisfaction. Ten thou&s;and Chri&s;tian &s;laves, among whom were &s;everal per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, met him as he entered the town; and falling on their knees, thanked and ble&s;&s;ed him as their deliverer.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time that Charles accompli&s;hed his promi&s;e to the Moori&s;h King of re-e&s;tabli&s;hing him in his dominions, he did not neglect what was nece&s;&s;ary for bridling the power of the African cor&s;airs, for the &s;ecurity of his own &s;ubjects, and for the intere&s;t of the Spani&s;h crown: In order to gain the&s;e ends, he con|cluded a treaty with Muley-Ha&s;cen on the following conditions; that he &s;hould hold the kingdom of Tu|nis in fee of the crown of Spain, and do homage to the Emperor as his liege lord; that all the Chri&s;tian &s;laves now within his dominions, of whatever nation, &s;hould be &s;et at liberty without ran&s;om; that no &s;ub|ject of the Emperor's &s;hould for the future be detain|ed in &s;ervitude; that no Turki&s;h cor&s;air &s;hould be ad|mitted into the ports of his dominions; that free trade, together with the publick exerci&s;e of the Chri&s;|tian religion, &s;hould be allowed to all the Emperor's &s;ubjects; that the Emperor &s;hould not only retain the Goletta, but all the other &s;ea-ports in the king|dom which were fortified, &s;hould be put into his hands; that Muley-Ha&s;cen &s;hould pay annually twelve thou&s;and crowns for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the Spa|ni&s;h garri&s;on in the Goletta; that he &s;hould enter in|to no alliance with any of the Emperor's enemies, and &s;hould pre&s;ent to him every year, as an acknow|ledgement

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE REIGN OF THE EMPEROR CHARLES V. BOOK VI.</HEAD>
<P>UNFORTUNATELY for the reputation of Francis I. among his contemporaries, his con|duct, at this juncture, appeared a perfect contra&s;t to that of his rival, as he laid hold on the opportunity afforded him, by the Emperor's having turned his whole force again&s;t the common enemy, to revive his preten&s;ions in Italy, and to plunge Europe into a new war. The treaty of Cambray, as has been ob|&s;erved, did not remove the cau&s;es of enmity between the two contending Princes; it covered up, but did not extingui&s;h the flames of di&s;cord. Francis, in par|ticular, who waited with impatience for a proper oc|ca&s;ion of recovering the reputation as well as territo|ries which he had lo&s;t, continued to carry on his ne|gociations in different courts again&s;t the Emperor, taking the utmo&s;t pains to heighten the jealou&s;y which many Princes entertained of his power or de|&s;igns, and to in&s;pire the re&s;t with the &s;ame &s;u&s;picion and fear: Among others, he applied to Francis Sfor|za,
<PB N="293" REF="011837_0695_0F9D89F65F3712D8">
who, though indebted to Charles for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on of the dutchy of Milan, had received it on &s;uch hard conditions, as rendered him not only a va&s;&s;al of the Empire, but a tributary dependant upon the Em|peror. The honour of having married the Emperor's niece, did not reconcile him to this ignominious &s;tate of &s;ubjection, which became &s;o intolerable even to Sforza, a weak and poor &s;pirited Prince, that he li&s;t|ened with eagerne&s;s to the fir&s;t propo&s;als Francis made of re&s;cuing him from the yoke. The&s;e propo&s;als were conveyed to him by Maraviglia, or Merveille, as he is called by the French hi&s;torians, a Milane&s;e gentle|man re&s;iding at Paris; and &s;oon after, in order to carry on the negociation with greater advantage, Merveille was &s;ent to Milan, on pretence of vi&s;iting his relations, but with &s;ecret credentials from Francis as his envoy. In this character he was received by Sforza. But notwithanding his care to keep that cir|cum&s;tance concealed, Charles &s;u&s;pecting, or having received information of it, remon&s;trated and threat|ned in &s;uch a high tone, that the Duke and his mi|ni&s;ters, equally intimidated, gave the world imme|diately a mo&s;t infamous proof of their &s;ervile fear of offending the Emperor. Having decoyed Merveille, who had neither the prudence nor temper which the &s;tation wherein he was placed required, into a quarrel in which he happened to kill his antagoni&s;t, one of the Duke's dome&s;tics, they in&s;tantly commanded him to be &s;eized, to be tried for that crime, and to be be|headed (Dec. 1533). Francis, a&s;toni&s;hed at this vio|lation of a character held &s;acred among the mo&s;t un|civilized nations, and enraged at the in&s;ult offered to the dignity of his crown, threatned Sforza with the effects of his indignation, and complained to the Em|peror, whom he con&s;idered as the real author of that unexampled outrage. But meeting with no &s;atisfacti|on from either, he appealed to all the Princes of Eu|rope, and thought him&s;elf now entitled to take ven|geance for an injury, which it would have been in|decent and pu&s;illanimous to let pa&s;s with impunity.</P>
<P>BEING thus furni&s;hed with a pretext for beginning a war, on which he had already re&s;olved, he multi|plied

his efforts in order to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> other Princes to take part in the quarrel. But all his mea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> for this purpo&s;e were di&s;concerted by unfore&s;een events. After having &s;acrificed the honour of his hou&s;e by the marriage of his &s;on with Catharine of Me|dici, in order to gain Clement, the death of that Pontiff had deprived him of all the advantages which he expected to derive from his friend&s;hip. Paul, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, though attached by inclination to the Impe|rial intere&s;t, &s;eemed determined to maintain the neu|trality &s;uitable to his character as the common father of the contending Princes. The King of England, occupied with dome&s;tic cares and projects, declined for once, engaging in the affairs of the continent, and refu&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t Francis, unle&s;s he would imitate his example, in throwing off the Papal &s;upremacy. The&s;e di&s;appointments led him to &s;olicit, with greater ear|ne&s;tne&s;s, the aid of the Prote&s;tant Princes a&s;&s;ociated by the league of Smalkalde. That he might the more ea&s;ily acquire their confidence, he endeavoured to ac|commodate him&s;elf to their predominant pa&s;&s;ion, zeal for their religious tenets. He affected a wonder|ful moderation with regard to the points in di&s;pute; he permitted Bellay, his envoy in Germany, to ex|plain his &s;entiments concerning &s;ome of the mo&s;t im|portant articles, in terms not far different from tho&s;e u&s;ed by the Prote&s;tants <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Freheri Script. Rer. German. iii. 354, &amp;c. Sleid. Hi&s;t. 178, 183; Seckend. lib. iii. 103.</NOTE>; he even conde&s;cended to invite Melancthon, who&s;e gentle manners and pacific &s;pirit di&s;tingui&s;hed him among the Reformers, to vi&s;it Paris, that by his a&s;&s;i&s;tance he might concert the mo&s;t proper mea&s;ures for reconciling the contending &s;ects, which &s;o unhappily divided the church <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Camerarii Vita Ph.

The&s;e con|ce&s;&s;ions mu&s;t be con&s;idered rather as arts of policy, than the re&s;ult of conviction; for whatever impre&s;&s;ion the new opinions in religion made on his &s;i&s;ters, the Queen of Navarre and Dutche&s;s of Ferrara, the gaiety of Francis's own temper, and his love of plea&s;ure, al|lowed him little lei&s;ure to examine theological con|trover&s;ies.</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="011837_0697_0F9D89F8908BD318">BUT &s;oon after he lo&s;t all the fruits of this di&s;inge|nuous artifice, by a &s;tep very incon&s;i&s;tent with his de|clarations to the German Princes. This &s;tep, however, the prejudice of the age, and the religious &s;entiments of his own &s;ubjects, rendered it nece&s;&s;ary for him to take. His clo&s;e union with the King of England an excommunicated heretick; his frequent negociations with the German Prote&s;tants; but above all, his giv|ing publick audience to an envoy from Sultan Soly|man, had excited violent &s;u&s;picions concerning the &s;incerity of his attachment to religion. To have at|tacked the Emperor, who, on all occa&s;ions, made high preten&s;ions to zeal in defence of the Catholick faith, and at the very juncture, when he was prepar|ing for his expedition again&s;t Barbaro&s;&s;a, which was then con&s;idered as a pious enterprize, could not have failed to confirm &s;uch unfavourable &s;entiments with regard to Francis, and called on him to vindicate him|&s;elf by &s;ome extraordinary demon&s;tration of his reve|rence for the e&s;tabli&s;hed doctrines of the church. The indi&s;creet zeal of &s;ome of his &s;ubjects, who had imbib|ed the Prote&s;tant opinions, furni&s;hed him with &s;uch an occa&s;ion as he de&s;ired. They had affixed to the gates of the Louvre, and other public places, papers containing indecent reflexions on the doctrines and rites of the Popi&s;h church. Six of the per&s;ons con|cerned in this ra&s;h action were di&s;covered and &s;eized. The King, in order to avert the judgments which it was &s;uppo&s;ed their bla&s;phemies might draw down up|on the nation, appointed a &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion. The holy &s;acrament was carried through the city in great pomp; Francis walked uncovered before it, bearing a torch in his hand; the princes of the blood &s;upported the canopy over it; the nobles marched in order be|hind. In the pre&s;ence of this numerous a&s;&s;embly, the King, accu&s;tomed to expre&s;s him&s;elf on every &s;ubject in &s;trong and animating language, declared that if one of his hands were infected with here&s;y, he would cut it off with the other, and would not &s;pare even his own children, if found guilty of that crime. As a dreadful proof of his being in earne&s;t, the &s;ix unhap|py per&s;ons were publickly burnt before the proce&s;&s;ion

was fini&s;hed, with circu&s;tances of the mo&s;t &s;hocking barbarity attending their execution <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Belcarii Camment. Rer, Gallic. 646. Sleid. Hi&s;t. 175, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Princes of the league of Smalkalde, filled with re&s;entment and indignation at the cruelty with which their brethren were treated, could not conceive Fran|cis to be &s;incere, when he offered to protect in Ger|many tho&s;e very tenets, which he per&s;ecuted with &s;uch rigour in his own dominions; &s;o that all Bellay's art and eloquence in vindicating his ma&s;ter, and apologi|zing for his conduct, made but little impre&s;&s;ion upon them. Be&s;ides, the Emperor, who hitherto had ne|ver employed violence again&s;t the doctrines of the Re|formers, nor even given them much mole&s;tation in their progre&s;s, was now bound by the agreement at Rati&s;bon, not to di&s;turb tho&s;e who had embraced the new opinions; and the Prote&s;tants wi&s;ely con&s;idered this as a more certain and immediate &s;ecurity, than the precarious and di&s;tant hopes with which Francis endeavoured to allure them. The manner too in which he had behaved to his allies at the peace of Cambray, was two recent to be forgotten, and did not encou|rage others to rely much on his friend&s;hip or genero&s;ity. Upon all the&s;e accounts, the Prote&s;tant Princes refu&s;|ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t the French King in any ho&s;tile attempt a|gain&s;t the Emperor. The Elector of Saxony, the mo&s;t zealous among them, in order to avoid giving any um|brage to Charles, would not permit Melancthon to vi&s;it the court of France, although that Reformer, flat|tered perhaps by the invitation of &s;o great a Monarch, or hoping that his pre&s;ence there might be of &s;ignal advantage to the Prote&s;tant cau&s;e, di&s;covered a &s;trong inclination to undertake the journey.<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Camerarii Vita Melan. 142, &amp;c. 415.

<P>BUT though none of the many Princes who envied or dreaded the power of Charles, would &s;econd Fran|cis's efforts in order to reduce and circum&s;cribe it, he, neverthele&s;s, commanded his army to advance towards the frontiers of Italy. As his &s;ole pretext for taking arms was, that he might cha&s;ti&s;e the Duke of Milan for his in&s;olent and cruel breach of the law of nations, it might have been expected that the whole weight of
<PB N="297" REF="011837_0699_0F9D89FAE6BB5FF0">
his vengeance was to have fallen on his territories. But on a &s;udden and at their very commencement, the operation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> or war took another direction. Charles Duke of Savoy, one of the lea&s;t active and able Prin|ces of the line from which he de&s;cended, had married Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Portugal, the Empre&s;s's &s;i&s;ter. By her great talents, &s;he &s;oon acquired an ab&s;olute a&s;cendant over her hu&s;band; and proud of her affinity to the Emperor, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> allured by the magnificent promi&s;es with which he flattered her ambition, &s;he formed an union between the Duke and the Imperial court, extremely incon&s;i&s;tent with that neutrality, which wi&s;e policy as well as the &s;ituation of his dominions had hitherto induced him to ob&s;erve in all the quarrels between the contending Monarchs. Francis was abundantly &s;en|&s;ible of the di&s;tre&s;s to which he might be expo&s;ed, if when he entered Italy, he &s;hould leave behind him the territories of a Prince, devoted &s;o ob&s;equiou&s;ly to the Emperor, that he had &s;ent his elde&s;t &s;on to be educa|ted in the court of Spain, as a kind of ho&s;tage for his fidelity. Clement the Seventh, who had repre&s;ented this danger in a &s;trong light during his interview with Francis at Mar&s;eilles, &s;ugge&s;ted to him, at the &s;ame time, the proper method of guarding again&s;t it, hav|ing advi&s;ed him to begin his operations again&s;t the Mi|lane&s;e, by taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Savoy and Piedmont, as the only certain way of &s;ecuring a communication with his own dominions. Francis, highly irritated at the Duke on many accounts, particularly for having &s;upplied the Con&s;table Bourbon with the money, which enabled him to levy that body of troops which ruined the French army in the fatal battle of Pavia, was not unwilling to let him now feel both how deep|ly he re&s;ented, and how &s;everely he could puni&s;h the&s;e injuries. Nor did he want &s;everal pretexts that would give &s;ome colour of equity to the violence which he intended. The territories of France and Savoy lying contiguous to each other, and inter|mingled in many places, various di&s;putes, unavoida|ble in &s;uch a &s;ituation, &s;ub&s;i&s;ted concerning the limits of their re&s;pective property; and be&s;ides, Francis had, in right of his mother Loui&s;e of Savoy, large claims
<PB N="298" REF="011837_0700_0F9D89FCB6DADCA8">
upon the Duke her brother, for her &s;hare in their fa|ther's &s;uccce&s;&s;ion. Being unwilling, however, to be|gin ho&s;tilities without &s;ome cau&s;e of quarrel more &s;pe|cious than the&s;e preten&s;ions, many of which were ob|&s;olete, and others dubious, he demanded permi&s;&s;ion to march through Piedmont in his way to the Milane&s;e, hoping that the Duke, from an exce&s;s of attachment to the Imperial intere&s;t, might refu&s;e this reque&s;t, and thus give a greater appearance of ju&s;tice to all his ope|rations again&s;t him. But&punc; if we may believe the hi&s;|torians of Savoy, better informed with regard to this particular than tho&s;e of France, the Duke readily, and with a good grace, granted what it was not in his power to deny, promi&s;ing free pa&s;&s;age to the French troops as was de&s;ired; &s;o that Francis, as the only me|thod now left of ju&s;tifying the mea&s;ures which he de|termined to take, was obliged to in&s;i&s;t for full &s;ati&s;|faction with regard to every thing that either the crown of France or his mother Loui&s;e could demand of the hou&s;e of Savoy <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;toire Genealogique de Savoye, par. Guichenou. 2. tom. fol. Lyon. 166<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, i. 639, &amp;c.</NOTE>. Such an eva&s;ive an&s;wer, as might have been expected, being made to this requi&s;ition, the French army under the admiral Brion poured at once into the Duke's territories at different places. The countries of Bre&s;&s;e and Bugey, united at that time to Savoy, were over-run in a moment. Mo&s;t of the towns in the dutchy of Savoy opened their gates at the ap|proach of the enemy; a few which attempted to make re&s;i&s;tance were ea&s;ily forced; and before the end of the campaign, the Duke &s;aw him&s;elf &s;tripped of all his dominions, but the province of Piedmont, in which there were not many places in a condition to be de|fended.</P>
<P>TO compleat the Duke's misfortunes, the city of Geneva, the &s;overeignty of which he claimed, and in &s;ome degree po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, threw of his yoke, and its re|volt drew along with it the lo&s;s of the adjacent terri|tories. Geneva was, at that time, an Imperial city; and though under the direct dominion of its own bi|&s;hops, and the remote &s;overeignty of the Dukes of Savoy, the form of its internal con&s;titution was pure|ly
<PB N="299" REF="011837_0701_0F9D89FD0BD1A668">
republican, being governed by &s;yndics and a coun|cil cho&s;en by the citizens. From the&s;e di&s;tinct and often cla&s;hing juri&s;dictions, two oppo&s;ite parties took their ri&s;e, and had long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in the &s;tate; the one compo&s;ed of the advocates for the privileges of the community, a&s;&s;umed the name of <HI>Eignotz,</HI> or confe|derates in defence of liberty; and branded the other, which &s;upported the epi&s;copal or ducal prerogatives, with the name of <HI>Mammelukes</HI> or &s;laves. At length, the Prote&s;tant opinions beginning to &s;pread among the citizens, in&s;pired &s;uch as embraced them with that bold enterprizing &s;pirit which always accompanied or was naturally produced by them in their fir&s;t operations. As both the Duke and Bi&s;hop were from intere&s;t, from prejudice, and from political con&s;iderations, vi|olent enemies of the Reformation, all the new con|verts joined with warmth the party of the Eignotz; and zeal for religion, mingling with the love of liber|ty, added &s;trength to that generous pa&s;&s;ion. The rage and animo&s;ity of two factions, &s;hut up within the &s;ame walls, occa&s;ioned frequent in&s;urrections, which terminating mo&s;tly to the advantage of the friends of liberty, they daily gained ground.</P>
<P>THE Duke and Bi&s;hop, forgetting their ancient conte&s;ts about juri&s;diction, had united again&s;t their common enemies, and each attacked them with his proper weapons. The Bi&s;hop excommunicated the people of Geneva as guilty of a double crime; of impi|ety, in apo&s;tati&s;ing from the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion; and of &s;acrilege, in invading the rights of his &s;ee. The Duke attacked them as rebels again&s;t their lawful Prince, and attempted to render him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the city, fir&s;t by &s;urprize, and then by open force. The citizens, de&s;pi&s;ing the thunder of the Bi&s;hop's cen|&s;ures, boldly a&s;&s;erted their independance again&s;t the Duke; and partly by their own valour, partly by the powerful a&s;&s;i&s;tance which they received from their al|lies, the canton of Berne, together with &s;ome &s;mall &s;upplies both of men and money, &s;ecretly furni&s;hed by the King of France, they defeated all his attempts. Not &s;atisfied with having repul&s;ed him, or with re|maining always upon the defen&s;ive them&s;elves, they
<PB N="300" REF="011837_0702_0F9D8A0071E7DD18">
now took advantage of the Duke's inability to re&s;i&s;t them, while overwhelmed by the armies of France, and &s;eized &s;everal ca&s;tles and places of &s;trength which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the neighbourhood of Geneva; thus delivering the city from the&s;e odious monuments of its former &s;ubjection, and rendering the public liber|ty more &s;ecure for the future. At the &s;ame time the canton of Berne invaded and conquered the Paijis de Vaud, to which it had &s;ome preten&s;ions. The canton of Friburgh, though zealou&s;ly attached to the Catho|lic religion, and having no &s;ubject of conte&s;t with the Duke, laid hold on part of the &s;poils of that unfortu|nate Prince. A great portion of the&s;e conque&s;ts or u&s;urpations being &s;till retained by the two cantons, add con&s;iderably to their power, and have become the mo&s;t valuable part of their territories, Geneva, notwith|&s;tanding many &s;chemes and enterprizes of the Dukes of Savoy to re-e&s;tabli&s;h their dominion there, &s;till keeps po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of its independance; and in con&s;equence of that ble&s;&s;ing, has attained a degree of con&s;ideration, wealth and elegance, which it could not otherwi&s;e have reached <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. de la Ville de Geneve, par Spon. 120.

<P>AMIDST &s;uch a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of di&s;a&s;trous events, the Duke of Savoy had no other re&s;ource but the Empe|ror's protection, which, upon his return from Tunis, he demanded with the mo&s;t earne&s;t importunity; and as his misfortunes were occa&s;ioned chiefly by his at|tachment to the Imperial intere&s;t, he had a ju&s;t title to immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Charles, however, was not in a condition to &s;upport him with that vigour and di&s;patch which the exigency of his affairs called for. Mo&s;t of the troops employed in the African expediti|on, having been rai&s;ed for that &s;ervice alone, were di&s;banded as &s;oon as it was fini&s;hed; the veteran for|ces under Antonio de Leyva were &s;carce &s;ufficient for the defence of the Milane&s;e; and the Emperor's trea|&s;ury was entirely drained by his va&s;t efforts again&s;t the Infidels.</P>
<P>BUT the death of Francis Sforza, (October 24) oc|ca&s;ioned,
<PB N="301" REF="011837_0703_0F9D8A01E91960A8">
according to &s;ome hi&s;torians, by the terror of a French inva&s;ion, which had twice been fatal to his family, afforded the Emperor full lei&s;ure to pre|pare for action. By this unexpected event, the na|ture of the war, and the cau&s;es of di&s;cord, were to|tally changed. Francis's fir&s;t pretext for taking arms, in order to cha&s;ti&s;e Sforza for the in&s;ult offered to the dignity of his crown, was at once cut off; but, as that Prince died without i&s;&s;ue, all Francis's rights to the dutchy of Milan, which he had yielded only to Sforza and his po&s;terity, returned back to him in full force. As the recovery of the Milane&s;e was the fa|vourite object of that Monarch, he in&s;tantly renewed his claim to it; and if he had &s;upported his preten&s;ions by ordering the powerful army quartered in Savoy, to advance without lo&s;ing a moment towards Milan, he could &s;carce have failed to &s;ecure the important point of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. But Francis who became daily le&s;s en|terprizing as he advanced in years, and who was over|awed at &s;ome times into an exce&s;s of caution by the remembrance of his pa&s;t misfortunes, endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h his rights by negociation, not by arms; and from a timid moderation, fatal in all great affairs, ne|glected to improve the favourable opportunity which pre&s;ented it&s;elf. Charles, meanwhile, in quality of &s;overeign, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the dutchy, as a vacant fief of the Empire; and while Francis endeavoured to explain and a&s;&s;ert his title to it, by arguments and memorials, u&s;ing every art in order to reconcile the Italian powers to the thoughts of his regaining foot|ing in Italy, his rival was &s;ilently taking effectual &s;teps to prevent it. The Emperor, however, was very careful not to di&s;cover too early any intention of this kind; but &s;eeming to admit the equity of Francis's claim, he appeared &s;ollicitous only about giving him po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in &s;uch a manner as might not di&s;turb the peace of Europe, or overturn the balance of power in Italy, which the politicians of that country were &s;o fond of pre&s;erving. By this artifice he deceived Francis, and gained &s;o much confidence with the re&s;t of Europe, that almo&s;t without incurring any &s;u&s;pici|on, he involved the affair in new difficulties, and pro|tracted
<PB N="302" REF="011837_0704_0F9D8A025607E098">
the negociations at plea&s;ure. Sometimes he propo&s;ed to grant the inve&s;titure of Milan to the Duke of Orleans, Francis's &s;econd &s;on, &s;ometimes to the Duke of Angouleme, his third &s;on; as the views and inclinations of the French court varied, he trans|ferred his choice alternately from the one to the other, with &s;uch profound and well conducted di&s;&s;imulation, that neither Francis nor his mini&s;ters &s;eem to have pe|netrated his real intention; and all military operations were entirely &s;u&s;pended, as if nothing had remained but to enter quietly into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what they de|manded.</P>
<P>DURING the interval gained in this manner, (1536) Charles prevailed on the &s;tates both of Sicily and Na|ples, who thought them&s;elves greatly honoured by the pre&s;ence of their &s;overeign on his return from Tunis, and who were no le&s;s plea&s;ed with the apparent di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of his expedition into Africa, than dazzled by the &s;ucce&s;s which had attended his arms, to vote him &s;uch liberal &s;ub&s;idies as were &s;eldom granted in that age. This enabled him to recruit his veteran troops, to levy a body of Germans, and to take every other proper precaution for executing or &s;upporting the mea&s;ures on which he had determined. Bellay, the French envoy in Germany, having di&s;co|vered the intention of rai&s;ing troops in that country, notwith&s;tanding all the pretexts employed in order to conceal it, fir&s;t alarmed his ma&s;ter with this evident proof of the Emperor's in&s;incerity <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Bellay, 192.</NOTE>. But Francis was &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at that time with the rage of negocia|tion, in all the artifices and refinements of which his rival far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed him, that in&s;tead of beginning his military operations, and pu&s;hing them with vigour or &s;eizing the Milane&s;e before the Imperial army was a&s;|&s;embled, he &s;atisfied him&s;elf with making new offers to the Emperor, in order to procure the inve&s;titure by his voluntary deed. His offers were, indeed, &s;o liberal and advantageous, that if ever Charles had in|tended to grant his demand, he could not have re|jected them with decency. He dextrou&s;ly eluded
<PB N="303" REF="011837_0705_0F9D8A04BAA467C8">
them by declaring that, until he con&s;ulted the Pope in per&s;on, he could not take his final re&s;olution with regard to a point which &s;o nearly concerned the peace of Italy. By this eva&s;ion he gained &s;ome farther time for ripening the &s;chemes he had in view.</P>
<P>THE Emperor at la&s;t advanced towards Rome, and made his public entry into that city with extraordina|ry pomp; (April 6) but it being found nece&s;&s;ary to remove the ruins of an ancient temple of peace in or|der to widen one of the &s;treets, through which the cavalcade had to pa&s;s, all the hi&s;torians take notice of this trivial circum&s;tance, which they are fond to in|terpret as an omen of the bloody war that followed. Charles, it is certain, had by this time bani&s;hed all thoughts of peace; and at la&s;t threw off the ma&s;k, with which he had &s;o long covered his de&s;igns from the court of France, by a declaration of his &s;entiments no le&s;s &s;ingular than explicit. The French amba&s;&s;a|dors having in their ma&s;ter's name demanded a defi|nitive reply to his propo&s;itions concering the inve&s;ti|ture of Milan, Charles promi&s;ed to give it next day in pre&s;ence of the Pope and Cardinals a&s;&s;embled in full con&s;i&s;tory. The&s;e being accordingly met, and all the the foreign amba&s;&s;adors invited to attend, the Empe|ror &s;tood up, and addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the Pope, ex|patiated for &s;ome time on the &s;incerity of his own wi&s;hes for the peace of Chri&s;tendom, and his abhor|rence of war, the mi&s;eries of which he enumerated at great length, with &s;tudied and elaborate oratory; he comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ined that all his endeavours to pre&s;erve the tranquility of Europe had hitherto been defeated by the re&s;tle&s;s and unju&s;t ambition of the French King; that even during his minority he had proofs of the unfriendly and ho&s;tile intentions of that monarch; that afterwards, he had openly attempted to wre&s;t from him the Imperial crown which belonged to him by a title no le&s;s ju&s;t than natural; that he had next invaded his kindom of Navarre; that not &s;atisfied with this, he had attacked his territories as well as tho&s;e of his allies both in Italy and the Low-Countries; that when the valour of the Imperial troops, rendered ir|re&s;i&s;table by the protection of the Almighty, had
<PB N="304" REF="011837_0706_0F9D8A054D74CF18">
checked his progre&s;s, ruined his armies, and &s;eized his per&s;on, he continued to pur&s;ue by deceit what he had undertaken with inju&s;tice; that he had violated every article in the the treaty of Madrid to which he owed his liberty, and as &s;oon as he returned to his dominions took mea&s;ures for rekindling the war which that pacification had happily extingui&s;hed; that when new misfortunes compelled him to &s;ue again for peace at Cambray, he concluded and ob&s;erved it with great in&s;incerity; that &s;oon thereafter he had formed dangerous connections with the heretical Princes in Germany, and incited them to di&s;turb the tranquillity of the Empire; that now he had driven the Duke of Savoy, his brother-in-law and ally, out of the greater part of his territories; that after injuries &s;o often re|peated, and amid&s;t &s;o many &s;ources of di&s;cord, all hope of amity or concord became de&s;perate; and though he was &s;till willing to grant the inve&s;titure of Milan to one of the Princes of France, there was lit|tle probability of that event's taking place, as Francis on the one hand, would not con&s;ent to what he judg|ed nece&s;&s;ary for &s;ecuring the tranquillity of Europe, nor, on the other, could he think it rea&s;onable or &s;afe to give him the unconditional po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all that he demanded. Let us not, however, added he, conti|nue wantonly to &s;hed the blood of our innocent &s;ub|jects; let us decide the quarrel man to man, with what arms he plea&s;es to chu&s;e, in our &s;hirts, on an i&s;land, a bridge, or aboard a galley moored in a river; let the dutchy of Burgundy be put in depo&s;it on his part, and that of Milan on mine; the&s;e &s;hall be the prize of the conqueror; and after that, let the united forces of Germany, Spain, and France, be employed to humble the power of the Turk, and to extirpate here&s;y out of Chri&s;tendom. But if he, by declining this method of terminating our differences, renders war inevitable, nothing &s;hall divert me from pro&s;e|cuting it to &s;uch extremity, as &s;hall reduce one of us to be the poore&s;t gentleman in his own dominions.

&s;ubjects, the number and valour of my troops, the experience and fidelity of my generals, all combine to en&s;ure it. Of all the&s;e advantages, the King of France is de&s;titute; and were my re&s;ources no more certain, and my hopes of victory no better founded than his, I would in&s;tantly throw my&s;elf at his feet and with folded hands and a rope about my neck, im|plore his mercy <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Bellay, 199.

<P>THIS long harangue the Emperor delivered with an elevated voice, a haughty tone, and the greate&s;t vehemence of expre&s;&s;ion and ge&s;ture. The French amba&s;&s;adors, who did not fully comprehend his meaning, as he &s;pake in the Spani&s;h tongue, were totally di&s;|concerted, and at a lo&s;s how they &s;hould an&s;wer &s;uch an unexpected invective; when one of them began to vindicate his ma&s;ter's conduct, Charles interpo&s;ed abruptly, and would not permit him to proceed. The Pope, without entering into any particular de|tail, &s;atisfied him&s;elf with a &s;hort but pathetic recom|mendation of peace, together with an offer of employ|ing his &s;incere endeavours, in order to procure that ble&s;&s;ing to Chri&s;tendom; and the a&s;&s;embly broke up in the greate&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment at the extraordinary &s;cene which had been exhibited. In no part of his conduct indeed, did Charles ever deviate &s;o widely from his general character. In&s;tead of that prudent recollecti|on, that compo&s;ed and regular deportment &s;o &s;trictly attentive to decorum, and &s;o admirably adapted to conceal his own pa&s;&s;ions, for which he was at all other times con&s;picuous, he appears on this occa&s;ion before the mo&s;t augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly in Europe, boa&s;ting of his own power and exploits with in&s;olence; inveighing again&s;t his enemy with indecency; and challenging him to combat with an o&s;tentatious valour, more be|coming a champion in romance, than the fir&s;t Mo|narch in Chri&s;tendom. But the well known and powerful operation of continued pro&s;perity, and of ex|aggerated prai&s;e, even upon the firme&s;t minds, &s;uffi|ciently account for this &s;eeming incon&s;i&s;tency. After having compelled Solyman to retreat, and having
<PB N="306" REF="011837_0708_0F9D8A0A67D16BA0">
&s;tripped Barbaro&s;&s;a of a kingdom, Charles began to con&s;ider his arms as invincible. He had been enter|tained, ever &s;ince his return from Africa, with re|peated &s;cenes of triumphs and public rejoicings; the orators and poets of Italy, the mo&s;t elegant at that time in Europe, had exhau&s;ted their genius in pane|gyric, to which the a&s;trologers added magnificent promi&s;es of a more &s;plendid fortune &s;till in &s;tore. In|toxicated with all the&s;e, he forgot his u&s;ual re&s;erve and moderation, and was unable to re&s;train this extrava|gant &s;ally of vanity, which became the more remark|able, by being both &s;o uncommon and &s;o public.</P>
<P>HE him&s;elf &s;eems to have been immediately &s;en&s;ible of the impropriety of his behaviour, and when the French amba&s;&s;adors demanded next day a more clear explanation of what he had &s;aid concerning the combat, he told them, that they were not to con&s;ider his pro|po&s;al as a formal challenge to their ma&s;ter, but as an expedient for preventing blood&s;hed; he endeavoured to &s;often other expre&s;&s;ions in his di&s;cour&s;e; and &s;poke in terms full of re&s;pect towards Francis. But though this &s;light apology was far from being &s;ufficient to remove the offence which had been given, Francis by an unaccountable infatuation, continued, to nego|ciate, as if it had &s;till been po&s;&s;ible to bring their diffe|rences to a period by an amicable compo&s;ition. Charles finding him &s;o eager to run into the &s;nare, favoured the deception, and by &s;eeming to li&s;ten to his propo|&s;als gained time to prepare for the execution of his own de&s;igns <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Bellay, 205, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AT la&s;t the Imperial army a&s;&s;embled on the fron|tiers of the Milane&s;e, to the amount of forty thou|&s;and foot, and ten thou&s;and hor&s;e, while that of France encamped near Vercelli in Piedmont, being greatly inferior in number, and weakened by the de|parture of a body of Swi&s;s, whom Charles artfully per&s;uaded the Popi&s;h cantons to recall, that they might not &s;erve again&s;t the Duke of Savoy, their an|cient ally. The French general, not daring to ri&s;que a battle, retired as &s;oon as the Imperiali&s;ts advanced (May 6). The Emperor put him&s;elf at the head of
<PB N="307" REF="011837_0709_0F9D8A0AC52E7250">
his forces, which the marquis del Gua&s;to, the Duke of Alva, and Ferdinand de Gonzago commanded un|der him, though the &s;upreme direction of the whole was committed to Antonio de Leyva, who&s;e abilities and experience ju&s;tly entitled him to that di&s;tinction. Charles &s;oon di&s;covered his intention not to confine his operations to the recovery of Piedmont and Savoy, but to pu&s;h forward and invade the &s;outhern provin|ces of France. This &s;cheme he had long meditated, and had long been taking mea&s;ures for executing it with &s;uch vigour as might en&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s. He had re|mitted large &s;ums to his &s;i&s;ter, the governe&s;s of the Low-Countries, and to his brother, the King of the Romans, in&s;tructing them to levy all the forces in their power, in order to form two &s;eparate bodies, the one to enter France on the &s;ide of Picardy, the other on the &s;ide of Champagne; while he with the main army, fell upon the oppo&s;ite frontier of the kingdom. Tru&s;ting to the&s;e va&s;t preparations, he thought it impo&s;&s;ible that Francis could re&s;i&s;t &s;o many unexpect|ed attacks, on &s;uch different quarters; and begun his enterprize with &s;uch confidence of its happy i&s;&s;ue, that he de&s;ired Paul Jovius the hi&s;torian, to make a large provi&s;ion of paper &s;ufficient to record the victories which he was going to acquire.</P>
<P>HIS mini&s;ters and generals, in&s;tead of entertaining the &s;ame &s;anguine hopes, repre&s;ented to him in the &s;tronge&s;t terms the danger of leading his troops &s;o far from his own territories, to &s;uch a di&s;tance from his magazines, and into provinces which did not yield &s;ufficient &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for their own inhabitants. They entreated him to con&s;ider the inexhau&s;tible re&s;ources of France in maintaining a defen&s;ive war, and the ac|tive zeal with which a gallant nobility would &s;erve a Prince whom they loved, in repelling the enemies of their country; they recalled to his remembrance the fatal mi&s;carriage of Bourbon and Pe&s;cara, when they ventured upon the &s;ame enterprize under circum&s;tan|ces which &s;eemed as certainly to promi&s;e &s;ucce&s;s; the marquis del Gua&s;to in particular, fell on his knees, and conjured him to abandon the undertaking as de&s;|perate. But many circum&s;tances combined in leading
<PB N="308" REF="011837_0710_0F9D8A0C202DC718">
Charles to di&s;regard all their remon&s;trances. He could &s;eldom be brought, on any occa&s;ion, to depart from a re&s;olution which he had once taken; he was too apt to under-rate or de&s;pi&s;e the talents of his rival the King of France, which differed &s;o widely from his own; he was blinded by the pre&s;umption which ac|companies pro&s;perity; and relied, perhaps, in &s;ome degree, on the prophecies which predicted the increa&s;e of his own grandeur. He not only adhered ob&s;tinate|ly to his own plan, but determined to advance to|wards France without waiting for the reduction of any part of Piedmont, except &s;uch towns as were ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary for pre&s;erving his communication with the Milane&s;e.</P>
<P>THE marquis de Saluces, to whom Francis had en|tru&s;ted the command of a &s;mall body of troops left for the defence of Piedmont, rendered this more ea|&s;y than he had any rea&s;on to expect. That nobleman, educated in the court of France, di&s;tingui&s;hed by con|tinual marks of the king's favour, and honoured &s;o lately with a charge of &s;uch importance, &s;uddenly, and without any provocation or pretext of di&s;gu&s;t, re|volted from his benefactor. His motives to this trea|cherous action, were as childi&s;h as the deed it&s;elf was ba&s;e. Being &s;trongly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a &s;uper&s;titious faith in divination and a&s;trology, he believed with full a&s;&s;urance, that the fatal period of the French nation was at hand; that on its ruins the Emperor would e|&s;tabli&s;h an univer&s;al monarchy; that therefore he ought to follow the dictates of prudence, in attaching him&s;elf to his ri&s;ing fortune, and would incur no blame for de&s;erting a Prince whom heaven had devot|ed to de&s;truction <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Bellay. 221. a. 246, b.</NOTE>. His trea&s;on became &s;till more odi|ous, by his employing that very authority with which Francis had inve&s;ted him, in order to open his king|dom to his enemies. Whatever was propo&s;ed or un|dertaken by the officers under his command for the defence of their conque&s;ts, he rejected or defeated. Whatever properly belonged to him&s;elf as command|er in chief, to provide or perform for that purpo&s;e, he totally neglected. In this manner, he rendered towns even of the greate&s;t con&s;equence untenable, by leaving
<PB N="309" REF="011837_0711_0F9D8A0D0BA93AC0">
them de&s;titute either of provi&s;ions, or ammunition or artillery, or a &s;ufficient garri&s;on; and the Imperia|li&s;ts mu&s;t have reduced Piedmont in as &s;hort time as was nece&s;&s;ary to march through it, if Montpezat, the governor of Fo&s;&s;ana, had not, by an extraordinary effort of courage and military conduct, detained them, almo&s;t a month, before that incon&s;iderable place.</P>
<P>BY this meritorious and &s;ea&s;onable &s;ervice, he gain|ed his ma&s;ter &s;ufficient time for a&s;&s;embling his forces, and for concerting a &s;y&s;tem of defence again&s;t a dan|ger which he now &s;aw to be inevitable. Francis fixed upon the only proper and effectual plan for defeating the inva&s;ion of a powerful enemy; and his prudence in chu&s;ing this plan, as well as his per&s;everance in execut|ing it, de&s;erve the greater prai&s;e, as it was equally con|trary to his natural temper, and to the genius of the French nation. He determined to remain altogether upon the defen&s;ive; never to hazard a battle, or even a great &s;kirmi&s;h, without certainty of &s;ucce&s;s; to for|tify his camps in a regular manner; to throw garri&s;ons only into towns of great &s;trength; to deprive the ene|my of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, by laying wa&s;te the country before them; and to &s;ave the whole kingdom, by &s;acrificing one of its provinces. The execution of this plan he committed entirely to the marechal Montmorency, who was the author of it; a man wonderfully fitted by nature for &s;uch a tru&s;t. Haughty, &s;evere, confi|dent in his own abilities, and de&s;pi&s;ing tho&s;e of other men; incapable of being diverted from any re&s;olu|tion by remon&s;trances or intreaties; and in pro&s;ecut|ing any &s;cheme, regardle&s;s alike of love and of pity.</P>
<P>MONTMORENCY, made choice of a &s;trong camp, under the walls of Avignon, at the confluence of the Rho&s;ne and Durance, one of which plentifully &s;up|plied his troops with all nece&s;&s;aries from the inland provinces, and the other covered his camp on that &s;ide, where it was mo&s;t probable the enemy would ap|proach. He laboured with unwearied indu&s;try to render the fortifications of this camp impregnable, and a&s;&s;embled there a con&s;iderable army, though greatly inferior to that of the enemy; while the King with
<PB N="310" REF="011837_0712_0F9D8A0D89E0F610">
another body of troops encamped at Valence, higher up the Rho&s;ne. Mar&s;eilles and Arles were the only towns he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to defend; the former in order to retain the command of the &s;ea; the lat|ter, as the barrier of the province of Languedoc; and each of the&s;e he furni&s;hed with numerous garri&s;ons of his be&s;t troops, commanded by officers, on who&s;e fi|delity and valour he could rely. The inhabitants of the other towns as well as of the open country, were compelled to abandon their hou&s;es, and were conduc|ted to the mountains, to the camp at Avignon or to the inland provinces. The fortifications of &s;uch places as might have afforded &s;helter or defence to the enemy were thrown down. Corn, forage and provi&s;ions of every kind, were carried away or de&s;troyed; all the mills and ovens were ruined, and the wells filled up or rendered u&s;ele&s;s. The deva&s;tation extended from the Alps to Mar&s;eilles and from the &s;ea to the con|fines of Dauphine; nor does hi&s;tory afford any in|&s;tance among civilized nations, in which this cruel expedient for the public &s;afety was employed with the &s;ame rigour.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, the Emperor arrived with the van of his army on the frontiers of Provence, and was &s;till &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with confidence of &s;ucce&s;s, that during a few days, when he was obliged to halt until the re&s;t of his troops came up, he began to divide his future conque&s;ts among his officers; and as a new incitement to &s;erve him with zeal, gave them liberal promi&s;es of offices, lands and honours in France <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Bellay, 266, a.</NOTE>. The face of de&s;olation, however, which pre&s;ented it&s;elf to him, when he entered the country, could &s;carce fail to damp his hopes; and to convince him that a Monarch, who, in order to di&s;tre&s;s an enemy, had voluntarily ruined one of his riche&s;t provinces, would defend the re&s;t with ob&s;tinate de&s;pair. Nor was it long before he became &s;en&s;ible, that Francis's plan of defence was as prudent as it appeared extraordinary. His fleet, on which Charles chiefly depended for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, was prevented for &s;ome time by contrary winds, and o|ther accidents to which naval operations are &s;ubject, from approaching the French coa&s;t; and even after
<PB N="311" REF="011837_0713_0F9D8A0E52587CC8">
its arrival, it afforded at be&s;t a precarious and &s;canty &s;upply to &s;uch a numerous body of troops <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Sandov. ii. 231.</NOTE>; nothing was to be found in the country it&s;elf for their &s;up|port; nor could they draw con&s;iderable aid from the dominions of the Duke of Savoy, exhau&s;ted already by maintaining two great armies. The Emperor was no le&s;s embarra&s;&s;ed how to employ, than how to &s;ub|&s;i&s;t his forces; for, though he was now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of almo&s;t an entire province, he could not however be &s;aid to have the command of it, while he held only defencele&s;s towns; and while the French, be&s;ides their camp at Aviguon, continued ma&s;ters of Mar&s;eil|les and Arles. At fir&s;t he thought of attacking the camp, and of determinating the war by one deci&s;ive blow; but &s;kilful officers, who were appointed to view it, declared the attempt to be utterly impracticable. He then commanded Mar&s;eilles and Arles to be inve&s;ted, hoping that the French would quit their advantageous po&s;t in order to relieve them; but Montmorency ad|hering firmly to his plan, remained immoveable at Avignon, and the Imperiali&s;ts met with &s;uch a warm reception from the garri&s;ons of both towns, that they relinqui&s;hed their enterprize with lo&s;s and di&s;grace. As a la&s;t effort, the Emperor advanced once more to|wards Avignon, tho' with an army harra&s;&s;ed by the perpetual incur&s;ions of &s;mall parties of the French light troops, weakened by di&s;ea&s;es, and di&s;pirited by di&s;a&s;|ters, which &s;eemed more intolerable, becau&s;e they were unexpected.</P>
<P>DURING the&s;e operations Montmorency found him|&s;elf expo&s;ed to greater danger from his own troops than from the enemy; and their incon&s;iderate valour went near to have precipitated the kingdom into the&s;e calamities, which he with &s;uch indu&s;try and caution had endeavoured to avoid. Unaccu&s;tomed to behold an enemy ravaging their country almo&s;t with|out controul; impatient of &s;uch long inaction; unac|quainted with the &s;low and remote, but certain effects of Montmorency's &s;y&s;tem of defence; the French wi&s;hed for a battle with no le&s;s ardour than the Impe|riali&s;ts. They con&s;idered the conduct of their general as a di&s;grace to their country. His caution they im|puted
<PB N="312" REF="011837_0714_0F9D8A0F122EB190">
to timidity; his circum&s;pection to want of &s;pi|rit; and the con&s;tancy with which he pur&s;ued his plan to ob&s;tinacy or pride. The&s;e reflections, whi&s;|pered, at fir&s;t, among the &s;oldiers and &s;ubalterns, were adopted, by degrees, by officers of higher rank; and as many of the&s;e envied Montmorency's favour with the King, and more were di&s;&s;atisfied with his har&s;h di&s;gu&s;ting manner, the di&s;content &s;oon became great in his camp, which was filled with general mur|murings, and almo&s;t open complaints again&s;t his mea|&s;ures. Montmorency, on whom the &s;entiments of his own troops made as little impre&s;&s;ion as the in&s;ults of the enemy, adhered &s;teadily to his &s;y&s;tem; though in order to reconcile the army to his maxims, no le&s;s contrary to the genius of the nation, than to the ide|as of war among undi&s;ciplined troops, he a&s;&s;umed an unu&s;ual affability in his deportment, and often explained with great conde&s;cen&s;ion the motives of his conduct, the advantages which had already re&s;ulted from it, and the certain &s;ucce&s;s with which it would be attend|ed. At la&s;t Francis joined his army at Avignon, which having received &s;everal reinforcements, he now con|&s;idered as of &s;trength &s;ufficient to face the enemy.

<P>HAPPILY the retreat of the enemy delivered the kingdom from the danger which any ra&s;h re&s;olution might have occa&s;ioned. The Emperor, after &s;pending two inglorious months in Provence, having perform|ed nothing &s;uitable to his va&s;t preparations, or that could ju&s;tify the confidence with which he had boa&s;ted of his own power, found that, be&s;ides Antonio de Leyva, and other officers of di&s;tincton, he had lo&s;t one half of his troops by di&s;ea&s;es, or by famine; and that the re&s;t were in no condition to &s;truggle any longer with calamities, by which &s;o many of their companions had peri&s;hed. Nece&s;&s;ity, therefore, extorted from him

orders to retire; and though he was &s;ome time in mo|tion before the French &s;u&s;pected his intention, a bo|dy of light troops, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by crowds of pea&s;ants, ea|ger to be revenged on tho&s;e who had brought &s;uch de&s;olation on their country, hung upon the rear of the Imperiali&s;ts, and by &s;eizing every favourable opportu|nity of attacking them, threw them often into confu|&s;ion.

<P>THUS Francis, by the prudence of his own mea|&s;ures, and by the union and valour of his &s;ubjects, rendered abortive tho&s;e va&s;t efforts by which his rival had almo&s;t exhau&s;ted his whole force. As this hum|bled the Emperor's arrogance no le&s;s than it checked his power, he was mortified more &s;en&s;ibly on this oc|ca&s;ion than on any other, during the cour&s;e of the long conte&s;ts between him and the French Monarch.</P>
<P>ONE circum&s;tance alone embittered the joy with which the &s;ucce&s;s of the campaign in&s;pired Francis. That was the death of the Dauphin, his elde&s;t &s;on, a Prince of great hopes, and extremely beloved by the people on account of his re&s;emblance to his father. This happening &s;uddenly, was imputed to poi&s;on, not only by the vulgar, &s;ond of a&s;cribing the death of il|lu&s;trious per&s;onages to extraordinary cau&s;es, but by the King and his mini&s;ters. The count de Montecu|culi, an Italian nobleman, cupbearer to the Dauphin, being &s;eized on &s;u&s;picion and put to the torture, open|ly charged the Imperial generals, Gonzaga and Leyva, with having in&s;tigated him to the commi&s;&s;ion of that crime, and threw out &s;ome indirect and ob&s;cure accu|&s;ations again&s;t the Emperor him&s;elf. At a time when all France was animated with implacable hatred again&s;t Charles, this was con&s;idered as an inconte&s;tible proof of guilt; while the confidence with which both he
<PB N="315" REF="011837_0717_0F9D8A11674738B8">
and his officers a&s;&s;erted their own innocence, together with the indignation and horror which they expre&s;&s;ed on their being &s;uppo&s;ed capable of &s;uch a dete&s;table ac|tion, were little attended to, and le&s;s regarded <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Bellay, 289.</NOTE>. It is evident however, that the Emperor could have no inducement to perpetrate &s;uch a crime, as Francis was &s;till in the vigour of life him&s;elf, and had two &s;ons, be|&s;ides the Dauphin, grown up to a good age. That &s;ingle con&s;ideration, without mentioning the Empe|ror's general character, unblemi&s;hed by the imputation of any deed re&s;embling this in atrocity, is more than &s;ufficient to counterbalance the weight of a dubious te&s;timony uttered during the angui&s;h of torture <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Sandov. Hi&s;t. del Emper. ii. 231.</NOTE>. Ac|cording to the mo&s;t unprejudiced hi&s;torians, the Dau|phin's death was occa&s;ioned by his having drunk too freely of cold water after overheating him&s;elf at ten|nis; and this account, as it is mo&s;t &s;imple, is likewi&s;e the mo&s;t credible. But if his days were cut &s;hort by poi&s;on, it is not improbable that the Emperor conjec|tured rightly, when he affirmed that it had been ad|mini&s;tred by the direction of Catharine of Medici, in order to &s;ecure the crown to the Duke of Orleans, her hu&s;band <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Vera y Zuniga Vida de Carlo V. p. 75.</NOTE>. The advantages re&s;ulting to her by the Dauphin's death, were obvious as well as great; nor did her boundle&s;s and daring ambition ever &s;cruple at any action nece&s;&s;ary towards attaining the objects which &s;he had in view.</P>
<P>NEXT year (1537.) opened with a tran&s;action very uncommon, but &s;o incapable of producing any effect, that it would not de&s;erve to be mentioned, if it were not a &s;triking proof of that per&s;onal animo&s;ity which mingled it&s;elf in all the ho&s;tilities between Charles and Francis, and which often betrayed them into &s;uch in|decencies towards each other, as le&s;&s;ened the dignity of both. Francis, accompanied by the peers and princes of the blood, having taken his &s;eat in the par|liament of Paris with the u&s;ual &s;olemnities, the advo|cate-general appeared; and after accu&s;ing Charles of Au&s;tria, (for &s;o he affected to call the Emperor) of having violated the treaty of Cambray, by which he
<PB N="316" REF="011837_0718_0F9D8A140687F770">
was ab&s;olved from the homage due to the crown of France for the counties of Artois and Flanders; in|&s;i&s;ted that this treaty being now void, he was &s;till to be con&s;idered as a va&s;&s;al of the crown, and, by con|&s;equence, had been guilty of rebellion in taking arms again&s;t his &s;overeign; and therefore he demanded that Charles &s;hould be &s;ummoned to appear in per&s;on, or by his coun&s;el, before the parliament of Paris, his le|gal judges to an&s;wer for his crime. The reque&s;t was granted; a herald repaired to the frontiers of Picardy, and &s;ummoned him, with the accu&s;tomed formalities to appear again&s;t a day prefixed. The term being expired, and no per&s;on appearing in his name, the parliament gave judgment, "That Charles of Au&s;tria had forfeited by rebellion and contumacy the&s;e fiefs; declared Flanders and Artois to be re-united to the crown of France; and ordered their decree for this purpo&s;e to be publi&s;hed by &s;ound of trumpet on the frontiers of the&s;e provinces <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Lettres et Memoires d'Etat par Ribier, 2. tom. Blois. 1666, tom. i. p. 1.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>SOON after this vain di&s;play of his re&s;entment, ra|ther than of his power, Francis marched towards the Low-Countries, as if he intended to execute the &s;en|tence which his parliament had pronounced, and to &s;eize tho&s;e territories which it had awarded to him. As the Queen of Hungary, to whom her brother the Emperor had committed the government of that part of his dominions, was not prepared for &s;o early a cam|paign, he at fir&s;t made &s;ome progre&s;s, and took &s;eve|ral towns of importance. But being obliged &s;oon to leave his army, in order to &s;uperintend the other ope|rations of war, the Flemings having a&s;&s;embled a nume|rous army, not only recovered mo&s;t of the places which they had lo&s;t, but began to make conque&s;ts in their turn. At la&s;t they inve&s;ted Terouenne, and the Duke of Orleans, now Dauphin, by the death of his brother, Montmorency, whom Francis honoured with the con&s;table's &s;word, as the reward of his great &s;ervice during the former campaign, determined to hazard a battle in order to relieve it. While they were advancing for this purpo&s;e, and within a few miles of the enemy, they were &s;topt &s;hort by the arrival of an
<PB N="317" REF="011837_0719_0F9D8A15EDA4BCF8">
herald from the Queen of Hungary, acquainting him that a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of arms was now agreed upon.</P>
<P>THIS unexpected event was owing to the zealous endeavours of the two &s;i&s;ters, the Queens of France and of Hungary, who had long laboured to reconcile the contending Monarchs. The war in the Nether|lands had laid wa&s;te the frontier provinces of both countries, without any real advantage to either; the French and Flemings equally regretted the interrup|tion of their commerce, which was beneficial to both; and Charles and Francis, who had each &s;trained to the utmo&s;t, in order to &s;upport the va&s;t operations of the former campaign, found that they could not now keep armies on foot in this quarter, without weakening their operations in Piedmont, where both wi&s;hed to pu&s;h the war with the greate&s;t vigour. All the&s;e circum&s;tances facilitated the negociations of the two Queens; a truce was concluded, (July 30) to continue in force for ten months, but it extended no farther than the Low-Countries <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Memoires de Ribier, 56.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN Piedmont the war was &s;till pro&s;ecuted with great animo&s;ity; and though neither Charles nor Francis could make the powerful efforts to which their animo&s;ity prompted them, they continued to exert them&s;elves like combatants, who&s;e rancour remains after their &s;trength is exhau&s;ted. Towns were alter|nately lo&s;t and retaken; &s;kirmi&s;hes were fought every day; and much blood was &s;hed, without any deci&s;ive action, that gave the &s;uperiority to either &s;ide. At la&s;t the two Queens determining not to leave unfini&s;h|ed the good work which they had begun, prevailed by their importunate &s;ollicitations, the one on her brother, the other on her hu&s;band, to con&s;ent al&s;o to a truce in Piedmont for three months, upon conditi|on that each &s;hould keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what was in his hands, and leaving garri&s;ons in the towns, withdraw his army out of the province; and that plenipotentia|ries &s;hould be appointed to adju&s;t all matters in di&s;|pute by a final treaty <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Ribier, 62.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE powerful motives which inclined both Prin|ces
<PB N="318" REF="011837_0720_0F9D8A17E9BF3D98">
to this accommodation, have been often mention|ed. The expences of the war had far exceeded the &s;ums which their revenues were capable of &s;upplying, nor dur&s;t they venture upon any great addition to the impo&s;itions then e&s;tabli&s;hed, as &s;ubjects were not yet taught to bear with patience the immen&s;e burthens to which they have become accu&s;tomed in modern times. The Emperor, in particular, though he had contract|ed debts which in that age appeared prodigious <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Ribier, i. 294.</NOTE>, had it not in his power to pay the large arrears which had been long due to his army. At the &s;ame time he had no pro&s;pect of deriving any aid in money or men either from the Pope or Venetians, though he had employ|ed promi&s;es and threats, alternately, in order to pro|cure it. But he found the former fixed in his re&s;o|lution of adhering &s;teadily to the neutrality which he had always declared to be &s;uitable to his character, and pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;irous of bringing about a peace. He perceived that the latter were &s;till intent on their ancient object of holding the balance even between the rivals, and &s;ollicitous not to throw too great a weight into either &s;cale.</P>
<P>WHAT made a deeper impre&s;&s;ion on Charles than all the&s;e, was the dread of the Turki&s;h arms, which Francis had drawn upon him by his league with Soly|man. Though Francis, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a &s;ingle ally, had a war to maintain again&s;t an enemy greatly &s;uperior in power to him&s;elf, yet &s;o great was the horror of Chri&s;tians, in that age, at any union with Infidels, which they con&s;idered not only as di&s;honourable but profane, that it was long before he could be brought to avail him&s;elf of the obvious ad|vantages re&s;ulting from &s;uch a confederacy. Nece&s;&s;i|ty at la&s;t &s;urmounted his delicacy and &s;cruples; and towards the clo&s;e of the preceding year, La Fore&s;t, a &s;ecret agent at the Ottoman porte, had concluded a treaty with the Sultan, whereby Solyman engaged to invade, next campaign, the kingdom of Naples, and to attack the King of the Romans in Hungary with a powerful army, while Francis undertook to enter the Milane&s;e at the &s;ame time with a proper force. Soly|man
<PB N="319" REF="011837_0721_0F9D8A1811404A50">
had punctually performed what was incumbent on him. Barbaro&s;&s;a with a great fleet appeared on the coa&s;t of Naples, filled that kingdom, from which all the troops had been drawn towards Piedmont, with con&s;ternation, landed without re&s;i&s;tance near Taran|too, obliged Ca&s;tro, a place of &s;ome &s;trength, to &s;ur|render, plundered the adjacent country, and was tak|ing mea&s;ures for &s;ecuring and extending his conque&s;ts, when the unexpected arrival of Doria, together with the Pope's gallies, and a &s;quadron of the Venetian fleet, made it prudent for him to retire. In Hungary the progre&s;s of the Turks was more formidable. Mahmet, their general, after gaining &s;everal &s;mall ad|vantages, defeated the Germans in a great battle at E&s;&s;ek on the Drave<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">I&s;tnanhaffi Hi&s;t. Hung. lib. xiii. p. 139.</NOTE>. Happily for Chri&s;tendom, it was not in Francis's power to execute with equal ex|actne&s;s what he had &s;tipulated; nor could he a&s;&s;emble at this juncture an army &s;trong enough to penetrate into the Milane&s;e. By this he failed in recovering po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of that dutchy; and Italy was not only &s;aved from the calamities of a new war, but from feeling as an addition to all that it had &s;uffered the de&s;olating rage of the Turki&s;h arms <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Jovii. Hi&s;tor. lib. xxxv, p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">83.</NOTE>. As the Emperor knew that he could not long re&s;i&s;t the efforts of two &s;uch powerful confederates, nor could expect that the &s;ame fortunate accidents would concur a &s;econd time to de|liver Naples, and to pre&s;erve the Milane&s;e: As he fore|&s;aw that the Italian &s;tates would not only tax him loudly with in&s;atiable ambition, but might even turn their arms again&s;t him, if he &s;hould be &s;o regardle&s;s of their danger as ob&s;tinately to protract the war, he thought it nece&s;&s;ary, both for his &s;afety and reputati|on, to give his con&s;ent to a truce. Nor was Francis willing to &s;u&s;tain all the blame of ob&s;tructing the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of peace, or to expo&s;e him&s;elf on that account to the danger of being de&s;erted by the Swi&s;s and other foreigners in his &s;ervice. He even began to apprehend that his own &s;ubjects would &s;erve him coldly, if by contributing to aggrandize the power of the Infidels, which it was his duty, and had been the
<PB N="320" REF="011837_0722_0F9D8A18C9EE28F8">
ambition of his ance&s;tors to depre&s;s, he continued to act in direct oppo&s;ition to all the principles which ought to influence a Monarch di&s;tingui&s;hed by the title of Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King. He cho&s;e, for all the&s;e rea&s;ons, rather to run the ri&s;que of di&s;obliging his new ally the Sultan, than, by an un&s;ea&s;onable adherence to the treaty with him, to forfeit what was of greater con|&s;equence.</P>
<P>BUT though both parties con&s;ented to a truce, the plenipotentiaries found in&s;uperable difficulties in &s;et|tling the articles of a definitive treaty. Each of the Monarchs, with the arrogance of a conqueror, aimed at giving law to the other; and neither would &s;o far acknowledge his inferiority, as to &s;acrifice any point of honour, or to relinqui&s;h any matter of right; &s;o that the plenipotentiaries &s;pent the time in long and fruitle&s;s negociations, and &s;eparated after agreeing to prolong the truce for a few months.</P>
<P>THE Pope, however, did not de&s;pair of accom|pli&s;hing a point in which the plenipotentiaries had fail|ed, and took upon him&s;elf the &s;ole burden of negoci|ating a peace. To form a confederacy capable of de|fending Chri&s;tendom from the formidable inroads of the Turki&s;h arms, and to concert effectual mea&s;ures for the extirpation of the Lutheran here&s;y, were two great objects which Paul had much at heart, and he con|&s;idered the union of the Emperor with the King of France as an e&s;&s;ential preliminary to both. To be the in&s;trument of reconciling the&s;e contending Monarchs, whom his predece&s;&s;ors by their intere&s;ted and indecent intrigues had &s;o often embroiled, was a circum&s;tance which could not fail of throwing di&s;tingui&s;hed lu&s;tre on his character and admini&s;tration. Nor was he without hopes that while he pur&s;ued this laudable end, he might &s;ecure advantages to his own family, the ag|grandizing of which he did not neglect, though he aimed at it with a le&s;s audacious ambition than was common among the Popes of that century. Influenced by the&s;e con&s;iderations, he propo&s;ed an interview be|tween the two Monarchs at Nice, and offered to re|pair thither in per&s;on, that he might act as mediator in compo&s;ing all their differences. When a Pontiff of a
<PB N="321" REF="011837_0723_0F9D8A198DB79CA8">
venerable character, and of very advanced age, was willing, from his zeal for peace, to undergo the fa|tigues of &s;uch a di&s;tant journey, neither Charles nor Francis could with decency decline the interview. But though both came to the place of rendezvous, &s;o great was the difficulty of adju&s;ting the ceremonial, or &s;uch the remains of di&s;tru&s;t and rancour on each &s;ide, that they refu&s;ed to &s;ee one another, and every thing was tran&s;acted by the intervention of the Pope, who vi&s;ited them alternately. Nor could he, with all his zeal and ingenuity, find out any method of re|moving the ob&s;tcales, particularly tho&s;e ari&s;ing from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Milane&s;e, which prevented a fi|nal accommodation; nor was all the weight of his authority, &s;ufficient to overcome the ob&s;tinate per&s;e|verance of either Monarch in a&s;&s;erting his own claims. At la&s;t, that he might not &s;eem to have laboured al|together without effect, he prevailed on them to &s;ign a truce for ten years, (June 18) upon the &s;ame condi|tion with the former, that each &s;hould retain what was now in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and in the mean time &s;hould &s;end amba&s;&s;adors to Rome, to di&s;cu&s;s their preten&s;i|ons at lei&s;ure <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Recueil des Traitez, ii. 210.

<P>THUS ended a war of no long continuance, but ve|ry exten&s;ive in its operations, and in which both par|ties exerted their utmo&s;t &s;trength. Tho' Francis fail|ed in the object that he had principally in view, the recovery of the Milane&s;e, he acquired, neverthele&s;s, great reputation by the wi&s;dom of his mea&s;ures, as well as the &s;ucce&s;s of his arms in repul&s;ing a formida|ble inva&s;ion; and by &s;ecuring po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one half of the Duke of Savoy's dominions, he added no incon&s;i|derable acce&s;&s;ion to his kingdom. Whereas, Charles, repul&s;ed and baffled, after having boa&s;ted &s;o arrogant|ly of victory, purcha&s;ed an inglorious truce, by &s;a|crificing an ally who had ra&s;hly confided too much in his friend&s;hip and power. The unfortunate Duke murmured, complained, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">emon&s;trated again&s;t a treaty &s;o much to his di&s;advantage; but in vain; he had no means of redre&s;s, and was obliged to &s;ubmit.

Of all his dominions, Nice, with its dependencies, was the only corner of which he him&s;elf kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on.

<P>A FEW days after &s;igning the treaty of truce, the Emperor &s;et &s;ail for Barcelona, but was driven by contrary winds to the i&s;land St. Margaret on the coa&s;t of Provence.

The Emperor, who would not be outdone by his rival in complai&s;ance, in&s;tantly repaired thither. As &s;oon as he ca&s;t anchor in the road, Francis, without waiting to &s;ettle any point of ceremony, but relying implicitly on the Emperor's honour for his &s;ecurity, vi&s;ited him on board his gal|ley, and was received and entertained with the warm|e&s;t demon&s;trations of e&s;teem and affection.

From implacable enmity, they appeared to pa&s;t, in a moment, to the mo&s;t cordial reconcilement; from &s;u&s;picion and di&s;|tru&s;t, to perfect confidence; and from practi&s;ing all the dark arts of a deceitful policy, they could a&s;&s;ume, of a &s;udden, the liberal and open manners of two gallant gentlemen.</P>
<P>THE Pope, be&s;ides the glory of having re&s;tored peace to Europe, gained, according to his expectati|on, a point of great con&s;equence to his family, by prevailing on the Emperor to betroth Margaret of Au|&s;tria his natural daughter, formerly the wife of Alex|ander de Medici, to his grand&s;on Octavio Farne&s;e, and in con&s;ideration of this marriage, to be&s;tow &s;everal honours and territories upon his future &s;on-in-law. A very tragical event, which happened about the begin|ning of the year one thou&s;and five hundred and thir|ty &s;even, had deprived Margaret of her fir&s;t hu&s;band. That young prince, whom the Emperor's partiality had rai&s;ed to the &s;upreme power in Florence, upon the ruins of the publick liberty, neglected entirely the cares of government, and abandoned him&s;elf to the mo&s;t di&s;&s;olute debauchery. Lorenzo de Medici his neare&s;t kin&s;man, was not only the companion but di|rector of his plea&s;ures, and employing all the powers of a cultivated and inventive genius in this di&s;honour|able mini&s;try, added &s;uch elegance and variety to vice as gained him an ab&s;olute a&s;cendant over the mind of Alexander. But while Lorenzo &s;eemed to be &s;unk in Luxury, and affected &s;uch an appearance of indolence and effeminacy, that he would not wear a &s;word, and trembled at the &s;ight of blood, he concealed under that di&s;gui&s;e, a dark, de&s;igning, audacious &s;pirit. Prompted either by the love of liberty, or allured by the hope of attaining the &s;upreme power, he determi|ned to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate Alexander his benefactor and friend. Though he long revolved this de&s;ign in his mind, his re&s;erved and &s;u&s;picious temper prevented him from communicating it to any per&s;on whatever; and conti|nuing to live with Alexander in their u&s;ual familiari|ty, he, one night, under pretence of having &s;ecured him an a&s;&s;ignation with a lady of high rank, whom-
<PB N="324" REF="011837_0726_0F9D8A1BE9E92BF8">
he had often &s;olicited, drew that unwary Prince into a &s;ecret apartment of his hou&s;e, and there &s;tabbed him, while he lay carele&s;sly on a couch, expecting the arrival of the lady who&s;e company he had been promi&s;ed. But no &s;ooner was the deed done, than &s;tanding a&s;toni&s;hed, and &s;truck with horror at its atro|city, he forgot, in a moment, all the motives which had induced him to commit it, and, in&s;tead of rouz|ing the people to recover their liberty, by publi&s;hing the death of the tyrant, in&s;tead of taking any &s;tep to|wards opening his own way to the dignity now va|cant, he locked the door of the apartment, and, like a man bereaved of rea&s;on and pre&s;ence of mind, fled with the utmo&s;t precipitation out of the Floren|tine territories. It was late next morning before the fate of the unfortunate Prince was known, as his at|tendants, accu&s;tomed to his irregularities, never en|tered his apartment early. Immediately the chief per|&s;ons in the &s;tate a&s;&s;embled. Being induced partly by the zeal of cardinal Cibo for the hou&s;e of Medici, to which he was nearly related, partly by the authority of Francis Guicciardini, who recalled to their memo|ry, and repre&s;ented in &s;triking colours, the caprice as well as turbulence of their ancient popular govern|ment, they agreed to place Co&s;mo di Medici, a youth of eighteen, the only male heir of that illu&s;trious hou&s;e, at the head of the government; though at the &s;ame time &s;uch was their love of liberty, that they e&s;ta|bli&s;hed &s;everal regulations in order to circum&s;cribe and moderate his power.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE Lorenzo having reached a place of &s;afety, made known what he had done, to Philip Strozzi and the other Florentines who had been driven into exile, or who had voluntarily retired, when the republican form of government was aboli&s;hed in or|der to make way for the dominion of the Medici. By them, the deed was extolled with extravagant prai&s;es, and the virtue of Lorenzo was compared with that of the elder Brutus, who di&s;regarded the ties of blood, or with that of the younger, who forgot the friend&s;hip and favours of the tyrant, that they might pre&s;erve or

recover the liberty of their country <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Lettere di Principi, tom. iii. p. 52.</NOTE>. Nor did they re&s;t &s;atisfied with empty panegyricks; they immedi|ately quitted their different places of retreat, a&s;&s;embled forces, animated their va&s;&s;als and partizans to take arms, and to &s;eize this opportunity of re-e&s;tabli&s;hing the publick liberty on its ancient foundation. Being o|penly a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the French amba&s;&s;ador at Rome, and &s;ecretly encouraged by the Pope, who bore no good will to the hou&s;e of Medici, they entered the Florentine do|minions with a con&s;iderable body of men. But the per&s;ons who had elected Co&s;mo po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed both the means of &s;upporting his government, and abilities to employ them in the mo&s;t proper manner. They levi|ed, with the greate&s;t expedition, a good number of troops; they endeavoured by every art, to gain the citizens of greate&s;t authority, and to render the admi|ni&s;tration of the young prince agreeable to the people. Above all, they courted the Emperor's protection, as the only firm foundation of Co&s;mo's dignity and pow|er. Charles, knowing the propen&s;ity of the Floren|tines to the friend&s;hip of France, and how much all the partizans of a republican government dete&s;ted him as the oppre&s;&s;or of their liberties, &s;aw it to be greatly for his intere&s;t to prevent the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the ancient con&s;titution in Florence. For this rea&s;on, he not only acknowledged Co&s;mo as head of the Floren|tine &s;tate, and conferred on him all the titles of ho|nour with which Alexander had been dignified, but engaged to defend him to the utmo&s;t; and as a pledge of this, ordered the commanders of &s;uch of his troops as were &s;tationed on the frontiers of Tu&s;cany, to &s;up|port him again&s;t all aggre&s;&s;ors. By their aid, Co&s;mo obtained an ea&s;y victory over the exiles, who&s;e troops he &s;urprized in the night-time, and took mo&s;t of the chiefs pri&s;oners; an event which broke all their mea|&s;ures, and fully e&s;tabli&s;hed his own authority.

<P>DURING the war between the Emperor and Francis, an event had happened which abated in &s;ome degree the warmth and cordiality of friend&s;hip which had long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the latter and the King of England. James the fifth of Scotland, an enterprizing young Prince, having heard of the Emperor's intention to in|vade Provence, and being fond of &s;hewing that he did not yield to any of his ance&s;tors in the &s;incerity of his attachment to the French crown, as well as eager to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf by &s;ome military exploit, levied a body of troops with an intention of leading them in per&s;on to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the King of France. Though &s;ome unfortunate accident prevented his carrying any troops into France, nothing could divert him from going thither in per&s;on. Immediately upon his land|ing he ha&s;tened to Provence, but had been detained &s;o long in his voyage that he could not have any &s;hare in the military operations, and he met the King on his return after the retreat of the Imperiali&s;ts, (January 1, 1537.) Francis, greatly plea&s;ed with his zeal, and no le&s;s with his manners and conver&s;ation, could not refu&s;e him his daughter Magdalen, whom he demand|ed in marriage. It mortified Henry extremely to &s;ee a Prince of whom he was lately become jealous, after having long treated him and his &s;ubjects with con|tempt, form an alliance, from which he derived &s;uch an acce&s;&s;ion both of reputation and &s;ecurity <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. of Scotland, vol. i. p. 77.</NOTE>. He could not, however, with decency oppo&s;e Francis's be&s;towing his daughter upon a Monarch de&s;cended from a race of Princes, the mo&s;t ancient and faithful allies of the French crown. But when James, upon the &s;udden death of Magdalen, demanded as his &s;econd wife Mary of Gui&s;e, he warmly &s;olicited Francis to deny his &s;uit, and in order to di&s;appoint him a&s;ked that lady in Marriage for him&s;elf. When Francis preferred the Scotti&s;h King's &s;incere court&s;hip to his artful and malevolent propo&s;al, he di&s;covered much
<PB N="327" REF="011837_0729_0F9D8A208661E558">
di&s;&s;atisfaction. The pacification agreed upon at Nice, and the familiar interview of the two rivals at Aigues|mortes, filled Henry's mind with new &s;u&s;picions, as if Francis had altogether renounced his friend&s;hip for the &s;ake of new connections with the Emperor. Charles, thoroughly acquainted with the temper of the Engli&s;h King, and watchful to ob&s;erve all the &s;hift|ings and caprices of his pa&s;&s;ions, thought this a favour|able opportunity of renewing his negociations with him, which had long been broken off. By the death of Queen Catherine, who&s;e intere&s;t the Emperor could not with decency have abandoned, the chief cau&s;e of their di&s;cord was removed; &s;o that without touching upon the delicate que&s;tion of her divorce, he might now take what mea&s;ures he thought mo&s;t effectual for regaining Henry's good will. For this purpo&s;e, he began with propo&s;ing &s;everal marriage-treaties to the King. He offered his niece, a daughter of the King of Denmark, to Henry him&s;elf; he demanded the Prince&s;s Mary for one of the Princes of Portugal, and was even willing to recieve her as the King's ille|gitimate daughter <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Mem, de Ribier, t. i 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">6</NOTE>. Though none of the&s;e projected alliances ever took place, or perhaps were ever &s;eri|ou&s;ly intended, they occa&s;ioned &s;uch frequent inter|cour&s;e between the courts, and &s;o many reciprocal profe&s;&s;ions of civility and e&s;teem, as con&s;iderably abat|ed the edge of Henry's rancour again&s;t the Emperor, and paved the way for that union between them which afterwards proved &s;o di&s;advantageous to the French King.</P>
<P>THE ambitious &s;chemes in which the Emperor had been engaged, and the wars he had been carrying on for &s;ome years proved, as u&s;ual, extremely favoura|ble to the progre&s;s of the reformation in Germany. While Charles was ab&s;ent upon his African expediti|on, or intent on his va&s;t projects again&s;t France, his chief object in Germany was to prevent the di&s;&s;en&s;ions about religion from di&s;turbing the publick tranquilli|ty, by granting &s;uch indulgence to the Prote&s;tant Princes as might induce them to concur with his mea|&s;ures, or at lea&s;t hinder them from taking part with

his rival. For this rea&s;on, he was careful to &s;ecure to the Prote&s;tants the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the advantages which they had gained by the articles of pacification at Nuremberg, in the year one thou&s;and five hundred and thirty-two <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Du Mont Corps Diplom. tom. iv. part 2. p. 138.</NOTE>; and except &s;ome &s;light trouble from the proceedings of the Imperial chamber, they met with nothing to di&s;turb them in the exerci&s;e of their religion, or to interrupt the &s;ucce&s;sful zeal with which they propagated their opinions. Meanwhile the Pope continued his negociations for convoking a general council; and though the Prote&s;tants had expre&s;&s;ed great di&s;&s;atisfaction with his intention to fix upon Mantua as the place of meeting, he adhered ob&s;tinate|ly to his choice, i&s;&s;ued a bull on the &s;econd of June, one thou&s;and five hundred and thirty-&s;ix, appointing it to a&s;&s;emble in that city on the twenty-third of May the year following; he nominated three cardinals to pre&s;ide in his name; enjoined all Chri&s;tian Princes to countenance it by their authority, and invited the prelates of every nation to attend in per&s;on. This ci|tation of a council, an a&s;&s;embly which from its nature and intention demanded quiet times, as well as paci|fic di&s;po&s;itions, at the very juncture, when the Empe|ror was on his march towards France, and ready to involve a great part of Europe in the confu&s;ions of war, appeared to every per&s;on extremely un&s;ea&s;onable. It was intimated, however, to all the different courts by nuncios di&s;patched of purpo&s;e <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Pallavie. Hi&s;t. Conc. Trid. 113.</NOTE>. The Emperor, with an intention to gratify the Germans, had, during his re&s;idence at Rome, warmly &s;olicited the Pope to call a council; but being at the &s;ame time willing to try every art in order to per&s;uade Paul to depart from the neutrality which he pre&s;erved between him and Fran|cis, he &s;ent Heldo his vice chancellor along with the nun|cio whom the Pope employed in Germany, in&s;truct|ing him to &s;econd all the nuncio's repre&s;entations, and to enforce them with the whole weight of the Impe|rial authority (February 25, 1537). The Prote&s;tants gave them audience at Smalkalde, where they had a&s;|&s;embled in a body, in order to receive them. But af|ter
<PB N="329" REF="011837_0731_0F9D8A23088C56D8">
weighing all their arguments, they unanimou&s;ly refu&s;ed to acknowledge a council &s;ummoned in the name and by the authority of the Pope alone; in which he a&s;&s;umed the &s;ole right of pre&s;iding; which was to be held in a city not only far di&s;tant from Ger|many, but &s;ubject to a Prince, a &s;tranger to them, and clo&s;ely connected with the court of Rome, and to which their Divines could not repair with &s;afety, e&s;pecially after their doctrines had been &s;tigmatized in the very bull of convocation with the name of here&s;y. The&s;e and many other objections again&s;t the council, which appeared to them unan&s;werable, they enumerated in a large manife&s;to, which they publi&s;h|ed in vindication of their conduct <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Sli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dan, l. xii. 123, &amp;c.

<P>AGAINST this the court of Rome exclaimed as a fla|grant proof of their ob&s;tinacy and pre&s;umption, and the Pope &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in his re&s;olution to hold the council at the time and in the place appointed. But &s;ome unexpected difficulties being &s;tarted by the Duke of Mantua, both about the right of juri&s;diction over tho&s;e who re&s;orted to the council, and the &s;ecurity of his capital amid&s;t &s;uch a concour&s;e of &s;trangers, the Pope, after fruitle&s;s endeavours to adju&s;t the&s;e, fir&s;t prorogued the council for &s;ome months, and after|wards transferring the place of meeting to Vicenza in the Venetian territories, appointed it to a&s;&s;emble on the fir&s;t of May in the following year. As neither the Emperor nor the French King, who had not then come to any accommodation would permit their &s;ub|jects to repair thither, not a &s;ingle prelate appeared on the day prefixed, and the Pope, that his authority might not become altogether contemptible by &s;o ma|ny ineffectual intimations, put off the meeting by an indefinitive prorogation <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">F.

<P>MEANWHILE, that he might not &s;eem to have turned his whole attention towards a reformation which he was not able to accompli&s;h, while he neglect|ed that which was in his power, he deputed a certain number of cardinals and bi&s;hops with full authority to inquire into the abu&s;es and corruptions of the Ro|man court; and to propo&s;e the mo&s;t effectual method

of removing them (1538). This &s;crutiny, undertaken with reluctance, was carried on &s;lowly and with remi&s;&s;|ne&s;s. All defects were touched with a gentle hand, afraid of probing too deep, or of di&s;covering too much. But even by this partial examination, many irregularities were detected, and many chormities expo&s;ed to light, while the remedies which they &s;ugge&s;ted as mo&s;t pro|per were either inadequate, or were never applied. The report and re&s;olutions of the&s;e deputies, though intended to be kept &s;ecret, were tran&s;mitted by &s;ome accident into Germany, and being immediately made publick, afforded ample matter for reflection and tri|umph to the Prote&s;tants <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Sleidan, 233.</NOTE>. On the one hand they de|mon&s;trated the nece&s;&s;ity of a reformation in the head as well as the members of the church, and even point|ed out many of the corruptions again&s;t which Luther and his followers had remon&s;trated with the greate&s;t vehemence. They &s;hewed on the other hand, that it was vain to expect this reformation from eccle&s;ia&s;ticks them&s;elves, who, as Luther &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed it, pid|dled at curing warts, while they overlooked or con|firmed ulcers <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Seck. l. iii. 164.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE earne&s;tne&s;s with which the Emperor &s;eemed, at fir&s;t, to pre&s;s their acquie&s;cing in the Pope's &s;cheme of holding a council in Italy, having alarmed the Pro|te&s;tant Princes &s;o much, that they thought it prudent to &s;trengthen their confederacy, by admitting &s;everal new members who &s;olicited that privilege, particular|ly the King of Denmark; Heldo, who during his re|&s;idence in Germany, had ob&s;erved all the advantages which they derived from that union, endeavoured to counterbalance its effects by an alliance among the ca|tholick powers of the Empire (1539.) This league, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of <HI>Holy,</HI> was merely defen|&s;ive, and though concluded by Heldo in the Emperor's name, was afterwards di&s;owned by him, and &s;ub&s;crib|ed by very few Princes <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Seck. l. iii. 171.

<P>THE Prote&s;tants &s;oon got intelligence of this a&s;&s;oci|ation, notwith&s;tanding all the endeavours of the con|tracting parties to conceal it; and their zeal, always

apt to &s;u&s;pect and to dread, even to exce&s;s, every thing that &s;eemed to threaten religion, in&s;tantly took the alarm, as if the Emperor had been ju&s;t ready to enter upon the execution of &s;ome formidable plan for the extirpation of their opinions. In order to di&s;appoint this, they held frequent con&s;ultations; they courted the Kings of France and England with great a&s;&s;iduity, and even began to think of rai&s;ing the re&s;pective con|tingents both in men and money, which they were obliged to furni&s;h by the treaty of Smalkalde. But it was not long before they were convinced, that the&s;e apprehen&s;ions were without foundation, and that the Emperor, to whom repo&s;e was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, after being exhau&s;ted by efforts beyond his &s;trength in the war with France, had no thoughts of di&s;turb|ing the tranquillity of Germany. As a proof of this, his amba&s;&s;adors, at an interview with the Prote&s;tant Princes in Francfort, (April 19) agreed that all con|ce&s;&s;ions in their favour, particularly tho&s;e contained in the pacification of Nuremberg, &s;hould continue in force for fifteen months; that during this period, all proceedings of the Imperial chamber again&s;t them &s;hould be &s;u&s;pended; that a conference &s;hould be held by a few divines of each party, in order to di&s;cu&s;s the points in controver&s;y, and to propo&s;e articles of accommodati|on, which &s;hould be laid before the next diet. Though the Emperor that he might not irritate the Pope, who remon&s;trated again&s;t the fir&s;t part of this agreement as impolitick, and again&s;t the latter, as an impious en|croachment upon his prerogative, never formally ra|tified this convention, it was ob&s;erved with con&s;ide|rable exactne&s;s, and greatly &s;trengthened the ba&s;is of that eccle&s;ia&s;tical liberty, for which the Prote&s;tants contended <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">F.

<P>A FEW days after the convention at Francfort, (A|pril 24) happened the death of George Duke of Saxo|ny, an event of great advantage to the Reformation. That Prince, the head of the Albertine or younger branch of the Saxon family, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, as marquis of Mi&s;nia and Thuringia, exten&s;ive territories, comprehending Dre&s;den.

in the electorate. From the fir&s;t dawn of the Reformation, he had been its enemy as avowedly, as the electoral Princes were its protectors, and had car|ried on his oppo&s;ition not only with all the zeal flow|ing from religious prejudices, but with a virulence in|&s;pired by per&s;onal antipathy to Luther, and imbittered by the dome&s;tick animo&s;ity, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between him and the other branch of his family. By his death without i&s;&s;ue, his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion fell to his brother Henry, who&s;e attachment to the Prote&s;tant religion, &s;urpa&s;&s;ed, if po&s;&s;ible, that of his predece&s;&s;or to popery. Henry no &s;ooner took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> new dominions, than, di&s;|regarding a clau&s;e in George's will, dictated by his bi|gotry, whereby he bequeathed all his territories to the Emperor and King of the Romans, if his brother &s;hould attempt to make any innovation in religion; he invited &s;ome Prote&s;tant divines, and among them Luther him&s;elf, to Leip&s;ick. By their advice and a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, he overturned, in a few weeks, the whole &s;y&s;|tem of antient rites, e&s;tabli&s;hing the full exerci&s;e of the reformed religion, with the univer&s;al applau&s;e of his &s;ubjects, who had long wi&s;hed for this change, which the authority of their Duke alone had hitherto prevented <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Sleidan, 249.</NOTE>. This revolution delivered the Prote&s;tants from the danger to which they were expo&s;ed, by hav|ing an inveterate enemy &s;ituated in the middle of their territories; and their dominions now extended in one great and almo&s;t unbroken line, from the &s;hore of the Baltick to the banks of the Rhine.</P>
<P>SOON after the conclu&s;ion of the Truce at Nice, an event happened, which &s;atisfied all Europe, that Charles had pro&s;ecuted the war to the utmo&s;t extremity, that the &s;tate of his affairs would permit. Va&s;t arrears were due to his troops, whom he had long amu&s;ed with vain hopes and promi&s;es. As they now fore&s;aw that little attention would be paid to their demands, when by the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of peace, their &s;ervices became of le&s;s importance, they lo&s;t all patience, broke out into open mutiny, and declared, that they thought them&s;elves entitled to &s;eize by violence, what was de|tained from them contrary to all ju&s;tice. Nor was this

&s;pirit of &s;edition confined to one part of the Emperor's dominions; the mutiny was almo&s;t as general as the grievance which gave ri&s;e to it. The &s;oldiers in the Milane&s;e, plundered the open country without con|troul, and filled the capital it&s;elf with con&s;ternation. Tho&s;e in garri&s;on at Goletta, threatned to give up that important fortre&s;s to Barbaro&s;&s;a. In Sicily, the troops proceeded to &s;till greater exce&s;&s;es; having cha&s;ed away their officers, they elected others in their &s;tead, defeated a body of men whom the viceroy &s;ent again&s;t them, took and pillaged &s;everal cities, con|ducting them&s;elves all the while, in &s;uch a manner, that their operations re&s;embled rather the regular pro|ceedings of a concerted rebellion, than the ra&s;hne&s;s and violence of a military mutiny. But by the ad|dre&s;s and prudence of the generals, who, partly by borrowing money in their own name, or in that of their ma&s;ter, partly by extorting large &s;ums from the cities in their re&s;pective provinces, rai&s;ed what was &s;ufficient to di&s;charge the arrears of the &s;oldiers, the&s;e in&s;urrections were quelled. The greater part of the troops being di&s;banded, &s;uch a number only as was nece&s;&s;ary for garri&s;oning the principal towns, and protecting the &s;ea coa&s;ts from the in&s;ults of the Turks, was kept in pay <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Jovii Hi&s;tor. l. xxxvii, 203. c.

<P>IT was happy for the Emperor, that the abilities of his generals extricated him out of the&s;e difficulties, which it exceeded his own power to have removed. He had depended, as his chief re&s;ource for di&s;charging the arrears due to his &s;oldiers, upon the &s;ub&s;idies which he expected from his Ca&s;tilian &s;ubjects. For this purpo&s;e, he a&s;&s;embled the Cortes of Ca&s;tile at To|ledo, and having repre&s;ented to them the great ex|pence of his military operations, together with the va&s;t debts in which the&s;e had nece&s;&s;arily involved him, he propo&s;ed to levy &s;uch &s;upplies as the pre&s;ent exigen|cy of his affairs demanded, by a general exci&s;e on commodities. But the Spaniards who already felt them&s;elves oppre&s;&s;ed with a load of taxes unknown to their ance&s;tors, and who had often complained that
<PB N="334" REF="011837_0736_0F9D8A28F014E620">
their country, in order to pro&s;ecute quarrels in which it was not intere&s;ted, and to fight battles from which it could reap no benefit, was drained not only of its wealth but of its inhabitants, determined not to add voluntarily to their own burthens, or to furni&s;h the Emperor with the means of engaging in new enter|prizes no le&s;s ruinous to the kingdom than mo&s;t of tho&s;e which he had hitherto carried on. The nobles, in particular, inveighed with great vehemence again&s;t the impo&s;ition propo&s;ed, as an encroachment upon the valuable and di&s;tingui&s;hing privilege of their or|der, that of being exempted from the payment of any tax. They demanded a conference with the the re|pre&s;entatives of the cities concerning the &s;tate of the nation. They contended that if Charles would imi|tate the example of his predece&s;&s;ors, who had re&s;ided con&s;tantly in Spain, and would avoid entangling him|&s;elf in a multiplicity of tran&s;actions foreign to the concerns of his Spani&s;h dominions, the &s;tated revenues of the crown would be fully &s;ufficient to defray the nece&s;&s;ary expences of government. They repre&s;ented to him that it would be unju&s;t to lay new burthens upon the people, while this prudent and effectual me|thod of re-e&s;tabli&s;hing public credit, and &s;ecuring na|tional opulence, was totally neglected <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Sandov. Hi&s;t. vol. ii. 269.</NOTE>. Charles, af|ter employing arguments, entreaties and promi&s;es, but without &s;ucce&s;s, in order to overcome their ob&s;ti|nacy, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the a&s;&s;embly with great indignation. From that period neither the nobles nor the prelates have been called to the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies, on pretence that &s;uch as pay no part of the public taxes, &s;hould claim no vote in laying them on. None have been admit|ted to the Cortes but the procurators or repre&s;enta|tives of eighteen cities. The&s;e to the number of thir|ty-&s;ix, being two from each community, form an a&s;|&s;embly which bears no re&s;emblance either in power or dignity or independence to the ancient Cortes, and are ab&s;olutely at the devotion of the court in all their determinations <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Sandov. ibid. La Science du Gou|vernement, par M. de Real, tom. ii. p. 102.</NOTE>. Thus the imprudent zeal with which the Ca&s;tilian nobles had &s;upported the regal pre|rogative,
<PB N="335" REF="011837_0737_0F9D8A2A001D6758">
in oppo&s;ition to the claims of the commons, during the commotions in the year one thou&s;and five hundred and twenty-one, proved at la&s;t fatal to their own body. By enabling Charles to depre&s;s one of the orders in the &s;tate, they de&s;troyed that balance to which the con&s;titution owed its &s;ecurity, and put it in his power and that of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to humble the other, and to &s;trip it of its mo&s;t valuable privileges.</P>
<P>AT that time, however, the Spani&s;h grandees &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed extraordinary power as well as privileges, which they exerci&s;ed and defended with an haughti|ne&s;s peculiar to them&s;elves. Of this the Emperor him|&s;elf had a mortifying proof, during the meeting of the Cortes at Toledo. As he was returning one day from a tournament, accompanied by mo&s;t of the nobi|lity, one of the &s;erjeants of the court, out of officious zeal to clear the way for the Emperor, &s;truck the Duke of Infantado's hor&s;e with his batton, which that haughty grandee re&s;enting, drew his &s;word, beat and wounded the officer. Charles, provoked at &s;uch an in&s;olent deed in his pre&s;ence, immediately ordered Ronquillo, the judge of the court, to arre&s;t the Duke; Ronquillo advanced to execute his charge, when the con&s;table of Ca&s;tile interpo&s;ing, checked him, claimed the right of juri&s;diction over a grandee as a privilege of his office, and conducted Infanta|do to his own apartment. All the nobles pre&s;ent were &s;o plea&s;ed with the boldne&s;s of the con&s;table in a&s;&s;ert|ing the rights of their order, that de&s;erting the Em|peror, they attended him to his hou&s;e with infinite applau&s;es, and Charles returned to the palace without any per&s;on along with him but the cardinal Tavera. The Emperor, how &s;en&s;ible &s;oever of the affront, &s;aw the danger of irritating a jealous and high-&s;pirited or|der of men, whom the &s;lighte&s;t appearance of offence might drive to the mo&s;t unwarrantable extremes. For that rea&s;on, in&s;tead of &s;training at any ill-timed exer|tion of his prerogative, he prudently connived at the arrogance of a body too potent for him to controul, and &s;ent next morning to the Duke of Infantado, of|fering to inflict what puni&s;hment he plea&s;ed on the per&s;on who had affronted him. The Duke con&s;ider|ing
<PB N="336" REF="011837_0738_0F9D8A2A13C80A88">
this as a full reparation to his honour, in&s;tantly forgave the officer; be&s;towing on him, be&s;ides, a con|&s;iderable pre&s;ent as a compen&s;ation for his wound. Thus the affair was entirely forgotten <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Sandov. 11. 274. Ferreras, ix. 212. Miniana, 113.</NOTE>; nor would it have de&s;erved to be mentioned, if it were not a &s;triking example of the haughty and independent &s;pirit of the Spani&s;h nobles in that age, as well as an in&s;tance of the Emperor's dexterity in accommodating his con|duct to the circum&s;tances in which he was placed.</P>
<P>CHARLES was far from di&s;covering any &s;uch con|de&s;cen&s;ion or lenity towards the citizens of Ghent, who not long after broke out into open rebellion a|gain&s;t his government. An event which happened in the year one thou&s;and five hundred and thirty-&s;ix, gave occa&s;ion to this ra&s;h in&s;urrection &s;o fatal to that flouri&s;hing city. At that time the Queen dowager of Hungary, governe&s;s of the Netherlands, having re|ceived orders from her brother to invade France with all the forces &s;he could rai&s;e, &s;he a&s;&s;embled the States of the united Provinces, and obtained from them a &s;ub&s;idy of twelve hundred thou&s;and florins, to defray the expence of that undertaking. Of this &s;um, the county of Flanders was obliged to pay a third part as its proportion. But the citizens of Ghent, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable city in that country, aver&s;e to a war with France with which they carried on an exten&s;ive and gainful commerce, refu&s;ed to pay their quota, and contended that in con&s;equence of &s;tipulations between them and the ance&s;tors of their pre&s;ent &s;overeign the Emperor, no tax could be levied upon them, unle&s;s they had given their expre&s;s con&s;ent to the impo&s;ition of it. The governe&s;s, on the other hand, maintain|ed that as the &s;ub&s;idy of twelve hundred thou&s;and flo|rins had been granted by the States of Flanders, of which their repre&s;entatives were members, they were bound, of cour&s;e, to conform to what was enacted by them, as it is the fir&s;t principle in &s;ociety, on which the tranquillity and order of government depend, that the inclinations of the minority mu&s;t be over-ruled by the judgment and deci&s;ion of the &s;uperior number.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="011837_0739_0F9D8A2ACD800E00">THE citizens of Ghent, however, were not willing to relinqui&s;h a privilege of &s;uch high importance as that which they claimed. Having been accu&s;tomed, under the government of the hou&s;e of Burgundy, to enjoy exten&s;ive immunities, and to be treated with much indulgence, they di&s;dained to &s;acrifice to the de|legated power of a regent tho&s;e rights and liberties which they had often and &s;ucce&s;sfully a&s;&s;erted again&s;t their greate&s;t Princes. The Queen, though &s;he endea|voured at fir&s;t to &s;ooth them, and to reconcile them to their duty by various conce&s;&s;ions, was at la&s;t &s;o much irritated by the ob&s;tinacy with which they adhered to their claim, that &s;he ordered all the citizens of Ghent, on whom &s;he could lay hold in any part of the Ne|therlands, to be arre&s;ted. But this ra&s;h action made an impre&s;&s;ion very different from what &s;he expected on men, who&s;e minds were agitated with all the vio|lent pa&s;&s;ions which indignation at oppre&s;&s;ion and zeal for liberty in&s;pire. Le&s;s affected with the danger of their friends and companions, than irritated at the go|verne&s;s, they openly de&s;pi&s;ed her authority, and &s;ent de|puties to the other towns of Flanders, conjuring them not abandon their country at &s;uch a juncture, but to concur with them in vindicating its rights again&s;t the encroachments of a woman, who either did not know or did not regard their immunities. All but a few in|con&s;iderable towns declined entering into any confe|deracy again&s;t the governe&s;s; however, they joined in petitioning her to put off the term for payment of the tax &s;o long, that they might have it in their power to &s;end &s;ome of their number into Spain, in order to lay their title to exemption before their &s;overeign. This &s;he granted with &s;ome difficulty. But Charles receiv|ed their commi&s;&s;ioners with an haughtine&s;s to which they were not accu&s;tomed from their ancient Princes, and enjoining them to yield the &s;ame re&s;pectful obedi|ence to his &s;i&s;ter, which they owed to him in per&s;on, remitted the examination of their claim to the council of Malines. This court, which is properly a &s;tanding committee of the parliament or &s;tates of the county, and which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the &s;upreme juri&s;diction in all mat|ters

<P>ENRAGED at this deci&s;ion, which they con&s;idered as notoriou&s;ly unju&s;t, and rendered de&s;perate on &s;eeing their rights betrayed by that very court which was bound to protect them, the people of Ghent ran to arms in a tumultuary manner, drove &s;uch of the no|bility as re&s;ided among them out of the city; &s;ecured &s;everal of the Emperor's officers; put one of them to the torture, whom they accu&s;ed of having &s;tolen or de&s;troyed the record, that contained the privileges of exemption from taxes which they pleaded; cho&s;e a council to whom they committed the direction of their affairs; gave orders for repairing and adding to their fortifications; and openly erected the &s;tandard of re|bellion again&s;t their &s;overeign <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Memoires &s;ur la revolte de Gantois en 1539, par Jean d'Hollander, ecrit en 1547.

Sen&s;ible, however, of their inability to &s;upport what their zeal had prompted them to undertake, and de&s;irous of &s;ecur|ing a protector again&s;t the formidable forces by which they might expect &s;oon to be attacked, they &s;ent &s;ome of their number to Francis, offering not only to acknowledge him as their &s;overeign, and to put him in immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Ghent, but to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with all their forces in recovering tho&s;e provinces in the Netherlands, which had antiently belonged to the crown of France, and had been &s;o lately re-united to it by the decree of the parliament of Paris. This un|expected propo&s;ition coming from per&s;ons who had it in their power to have performed in&s;tantly one part of what they undertook, and who could contribute &s;o effectually towards the execution of the whole, o|pened va&s;t as well as alluring pro&s;pects to Francis's ambition. The counties of Flanders and Artois were of greater value than the dutchy of Milan, which he had &s;o long laboured to acquire with pa&s;&s;ionate but fruitle&s;s de&s;ire; their &s;ituation with re&s;pect to France

rendered it more ea&s;y to conquer or to defend them; and they might be formed into a &s;eparate principality for the Duke of Orleans, no le&s;s &s;uitable to his digni|ty than that which his father aimed at obtaining. From this, the Flemings, who were acquainted with the French manners and government, would not have been aver&s;e; and his own &s;ubjects, weary of their de|&s;tructive expeditions into Italy, would have turned their arms towards this quarter with more good will, and with greater vigour. Several con&s;iderations, ne|verthele&s;s, prevented Francis from laying hold of this opportunity, the mo&s;t favourable in appearance which had ever pre&s;ented it&s;elf, of extending his dominions or di&s;tre&s;&s;ing the Emperor. From the time of their in|terview at Aigues-mortes, Charles had continued to court the King of France with wonderful attention; and often flattered him with hopes of gratifying at la&s;t his wi&s;hes concerning the Milane&s;e, by granting the inve&s;titure of it either to him or to one of his &s;ons. But though the&s;e hopes and promi&s;es were thrown out with no other intention than to detach him from his confederacy with the grand Seignior, or to rai&s;e &s;u&s;picions in Solyman's mind by the appearance of a cordial and familiar intercour&s;e &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the courts of Paris and Madrid, Francis was weak enough to catch at the &s;hadow by which he had been &s;o often deceived, and from eagerne&s;s to &s;eize it, relinqui&s;hed what mu&s;t have proved a more &s;ub&s;tantial acqui&s;ition. Be&s;ides this, the Dauphin jealous to exce&s;s of his bro|ther, and unwilling that a Prince who &s;eemed to be of a re&s;tle&s;s and enterprizing nature &s;hould obtain an e&s;tabli&s;hment, which from its &s;ituation might be con|&s;idered almo&s;t as a dome&s;tick one, made u&s;e of Mont|morency, who by a &s;ingular piece of good fortune, was at the &s;ame time the favourite of the father and of the &s;on, to defeat the application of the Flemings and to divert the King from e&s;pou&s;ing their cau&s;e. Mont|morency repre&s;ented accordingly the reputation and power which Francis would acquire by recovering that footing which he had formerly in Italy, and that nothing could be &s;o efficacious to overcome the Em|peror's aver&s;ion to this, as his adhering &s;acredly to the
<PB N="340" REF="011837_0742_0F9D8A2D551BCB18">
truce, and refu&s;ing on this occa&s;ion to countenance his rebellious &s;ubjects. Francis, apt of him&s;elf to o|ver-rate the value of the Milane&s;e, becau&s;e he e&s;tima|ted it from the length of time as well as from the great efforts which he had employed in order to re|conquer it, and fond of every action which had the appearance of genero&s;ity, a&s;&s;ented without difficulty to &s;entiments &s;o agreeable to his own, rejected the propo&s;itions of the citizens of Ghent, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed their deputies with an har&s;h an&s;wer <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Bellay, p. 263.

<P>NOT &s;atisfied with this, by a farther refinement in genero&s;ity, he communicated to the Emperor his whole negociation with the malecontents, and all that he knew of their &s;chemes and intentions <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Sandov. Hi&s;tor. tom. ii. 282.</NOTE>. This con|vincing proof of Francis's din&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s relieved Charles from the mo&s;t di&s;quieting apprehen&s;ions, and opened a way to extricate him&s;elf out of all difficulties. He had already received full information of all the tran&s;actions in the Netherlands, and of the rage with which the people of Ghent had taken arms again&s;t his government. He was thoroughly acquainted with the genius and qualities of his &s;ubjects in that country; their love of liberty; their attachment to their anci|ent privileges and cu&s;toms; as well as the invincible ob&s;tinacy with which their minds, &s;low but firm and per&s;evering, adhered to any mea&s;ure on which they had lei&s;ure to fix. He ea&s;ily &s;aw what encouragement and &s;upport they would have derived from the a&s;&s;i&s;|tance of France; though now free from any danger on that quarter, he was &s;till &s;en&s;ible that &s;ome immedi|ate and vigorous interpo&s;ition was nece&s;&s;ary in order to prevent the &s;pirit of di&s;affection and rebellion from &s;preading in a country where the number of cities, the multitude of people, together with the great wealth diffu&s;ed among them by commerce, rendered it pecu|liarly formidable, and would &s;upply it with exhau&s;ti|ble re&s;ources. No expedient, after long deliberation, appeared to him &s;o effectual as his going in per&s;on to the Netherlands; and the governe&s;s his &s;i&s;ter being of the &s;ame opinion, warmly &s;olicited him to undertake
<PB N="341" REF="011837_0743_0F9D8A2DCB0BC628">
the journey. There were only two different routs which he could take; one by land through Italy and Germany, the other, entirely by &s;ea, from &s;ome port in Spain to one in the Low-Countries. But the for|mer was more tedious than &s;uited the pre&s;ent exigen|cy of his affairs; nor could he in con&s;i&s;tency with his dignity or even his &s;afety pa&s;s through Germany with|out &s;uch a train both of attendants and of troops, as would have added greatly to the time that he mu&s;t have con&s;umed in his journey; the latter was dange|rous at this &s;ea&s;on, and not to be ventured upon, while he was on bad terms with the King of England, unle&s;s under the convoy of a powerful fleet. This perplexing &s;ituation, in which he was under a nece&s;|&s;ity of chu&s;ing, and did not know what to chu&s;e, in|&s;pired him at la&s;t with the &s;ingular and &s;eemingly ex|travagant thought of pa&s;&s;ing through France, as the mo&s;t expeditious way of reaching the Netherlands. He propo&s;ed in his council to demand Francis's per|mi&s;&s;ion for that purpo&s;e. All his coun&s;ellors joined with one voice in condemning the mea&s;ure as no le&s;s ra&s;h than unprecedented, and which mu&s;t infallibly expo&s;e him to di&s;grace or to danger; to di&s;grace if the demand were rejected in the manner that he had rea&s;on to expect; to danger, if he put his per&s;on in the power of an enemy whom he had often offended, who had ancient injuries to revenge, as well as &s;ub|jects of pre&s;ent conte&s;t &s;till remaining undecided. But Charles who had &s;tudied the character of his rival with greater care, and more profound di&s;cernment than any of his mini&s;ters, per&s;i&s;ted in his plan, and flatter|ed him&s;elf that it might be accompli&s;hed not only without danger to his own per&s;on, but even without the expence of any conce&s;&s;ion detrimental to his crown.</P>
<P>WITH this view he communicated the matter to the French amba&s;&s;ador at his court, and &s;ent Granvelle his chief mini&s;ter to Paris, in order to obtain from Francis permi&s;&s;ion to pa&s;s through his dominions, and to promi&s;e that he would &s;oon &s;ettle the affair of the Milane&s;e to his &s;atisfaction; but at the &s;ame time to intreat that he would not exact any new promi&s;e, or

even in&s;i&s;t on former engagements, at this juncture, le&s;t whatever he &s;hould grant, under his pre&s;ent cir|cum&s;tances, might &s;eem rather to be extorted by ne|ce&s;&s;ity, than to flow from friend&s;hip or the love of ju&s;|tice. Francis, in&s;tead of attending to the &s;nare which &s;uch a &s;light artifice &s;carce concealed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> dazzled with the &s;plendour of overcoming an enemy by acts of genero&s;ity, and &s;o plea&s;ed with the air of &s;uperiority, which the rectitude and di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of his pro|ceedings gave him on this occa&s;ion, that he at once a&s;&s;ented to all that was demanded. Judging of the Emperor's heart by his own, he imagined that the &s;entiments of gratitude, ari&s;ing from the remembrance of good offices and liberal treatment, would determine him more forcibly to fulfill what he had &s;o often pro|mi&s;ed, than the mo&s;t preci&s;e &s;tipulations that could be in&s;erted in any treaty.</P>
<P>UPON this, Charles, to whom every moment was precious, &s;et out, notwith&s;tanding the fears and &s;u&s;|picions of his Spani&s;h &s;ubjects, with a &s;mall but &s;plen|did train of an hundred per&s;ons. At Bavonne, on the frontiers of France, he was received by the Dau|phin and the Duke of Orleans, attended by the con|&s;table Montmorency, The two Princes offered to go into Spain, and to remain there as ho&s;tages for the Emperor's &s;afety; but this he rejected, declaring, that he relied with implicit confidence on the King's honour, and had never demanded, nor would accept of any other pledge for his &s;ecurity. In all the towns through which he pa&s;&s;ed, the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible magni|ficence was di&s;played; the magi&s;trates pre&s;ented him the keys of the gates; the pri&s;on doors were &s;et open; and by the royal honours paid to him, he appeared more like the &s;overeign of the country, than a &s;tran|ger. The King advanced as far as Chatelherault to meet him; their interview was di&s;tingui&s;hed by the warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip and regard. They proceeded together towards Paris, and pre&s;ented to the inhabitants of that city, the extraordinary &s;pecta|cle of two rival Monarchs, who&s;e enmity had di&s;turbed and laid wa&s;te Europe, during twenty years, making their &s;olemn entry together, with all the &s;ymptons of

<P>CHARLES remained &s;ix days at Paris; but amid&s;t the perpetual care&s;&s;es of the French court, and the va|rious entertainments contrived to amu&s;e or to do him honour, he di&s;covered an extreme impatience to con|tinue his journey, ari&s;ing as much from an apprehen|&s;ion of danger which con&s;tantly oppre&s;&s;ed him, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from the nece&s;&s;ity of his pre&s;ence in the Low-Countries. Con&s;cious of the di&s;ingenuity of his own intentions, he trembled when he reflected, that &s;ome fatal accident might betray them to his rival, or lead him to &s;u&s;pect them; and though his artifices to conceal the&s;e &s;hould be &s;ucce&s;sful, he could not help fearing that motives of intere&s;t, might at la&s;t triumph over the &s;cruples of honour, and tempt Francis to avail him&s;elf of the ad|vantage now in his hands. Nor were there wanting per&s;ons among the French mini&s;ters, who advi&s;ed the King to turn his own arts again&s;t the Emperor, and as the retribution due for &s;o many in&s;tances of fraud or fal&s;ehood, to &s;eize and detain his per&s;on, till he granted him full &s;atisfactson with regard to all the ju&s;t claims of the French crown, (1540). But no con&s;i|deration could induce Francis to violate the faith which he had pledged, nor could any argument con|vince him, that Charles, after all the promi&s;es that he had given, and all the favours which he had received, might &s;till be capable of deceiving him. Full of this fal&s;e confidence, he accompanied him to St. Quintin, and the two Princes, who had met him on the borders of Spain, did not take leave of him, until he entered his dominions in the Low-Countries.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as the Emperor reached his own territories (January 24) the French amba&s;&s;adors demanded the accompli&s;hment of what he had promi&s;ed, concerning the inve&s;titure of Milan, but Charles, under the plau|&s;ible pretext, that his whole attention was then en|gro&s;&s;ed by the con&s;ultations nece&s;&s;ary towards &s;up|pre&s;&s;ing the rebellion in Ghent, put off the matter for &s;ome time.

Charles without vouch&s;afing them any other an&s;wer, than that he would appear among them, as their &s;overeign, with the &s;ceptre and the &s;word in his hand, began his march at the head of his troops.

Twenty-&s;ix of the principal citizens were put to death (April 20;) a greater number was &s;ent in|to bani&s;hment; the city was declared to have forfeit|ed all its privileges and immunities; the revenues be|longed to it were confi&s;cated; its ancient form of go|vemnent was aboli&s;hed; the nomination of its magi|&s;trates was ve&s;ted for the future in the Emperor and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors; a new &s;y&s;tem of laws and political ad|mini&s;tration was pre&s;cribed <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Les coutumes &amp; loix da Compt&egrave; de Flandre, par Alex. le Grande, 3 tom. fol.

By the&s;e rigorous proceedings, Charles not only puni&s;hed the citizens of Ghent, but &s;et an awful example of &s;everity before his other &s;ubjects in the Netherlands, who&s;e immunities and privileges, partly the effect, partly the cau&s;e of their exten&s;ive commerce, circum&s;cribed the royal prerogative within very narrow bounds, and often &s;tood in the way of mea&s;ures which he wi&s;hed to undertake, or fettered and retarded him in his operations.</P>
<P>CHARLES having thus vindicated and re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ed his authority in the Low-Countries, and being now under no nece&s;&s;ity of continuing the &s;ame &s;cene of fal&s;ehood and di&s;&s;imulation with which he had long amu&s;ed Francis, began gradually to throw a&s;ide the veil under which he had concealed his intentions with re&s;pect to the Milane&s;e. At fir&s;t, he eluded the demands of the French amba&s;&s;adors, when they again reminded him of his promi&s;es; then he propo&s;ed, by way of equivalent for the dutchy of Milan, to grant the Duke of Orleans the inve&s;titure of Flanders, clog|ging the offer, however, with impracticable conditi|ons, or &s;uch as he knew would be rejected <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Ribier, i. 509. 514.</NOTE>.

preci&s;e and rigid morality by which monarchs think them&s;elves entitled to regulate their conduct. But, on this occa&s;ion, the &s;cheme that he formed of deceiv|ing a generous and open-hearted Prince; the illiberal and mean artifices by which he carried it on; the in|&s;en&s;ibility with which he received all the marks of his friend&s;hip, and the ingratitude with which he requit|ed them; are all equally unbecoming the dignity of his character, and incon&s;i&s;tent with the grandeur of his views.</P>
<P>THIS tran&s;action expo&s;ed Francis to as much &s;corn as it did the Emperor to cen&s;ure. After the experi|ence of a long reign, after &s;o many opportunities of di&s;covering the duplicity and artifices of his rival, the credulous &s;implicity with which he tru&s;ted him at this juncture &s;eemed to merit no other return than it actu|ally met with. Francis, however, remon&s;trated and exclaimed, as if this had been the fir&s;t in&s;tance in which the Emperor had deceived him. Feeling, as is u&s;ual, the in&s;ult which was offered to his under&s;tand|ing &s;till more &s;en&s;ibly than the injury done to his in|tere&s;t, he di&s;covered &s;uch re&s;entment as made it ob|vious that he would lay hold on the fir&s;t opportunity of being revenged, and that a war, no le&s;s rancorous than that which had &s;o lately raged, would &s;oon break out anew in Europe.</P>
<P>THIS year is rendered memorable by the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of the order of Je&s;uits; a body who&s;e influence on eccle&s;ia&s;tical as well as civil affairs hath been &s;o con|&s;iderable, that an account of the genius of its laws and government ju&s;tly merits a place in hi&s;tory.

enthu&s;ia&s;m. Ignatio Loyola, whom I have already mentioned on occa&s;ion of the wound which he receiv|ed in defending Pampeluna <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Book ii. p. 84.</NOTE>, was a fanatick di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by extravagancies in &s;entiment and conduct, no le&s;s incompatible with the maxims of &s;ober rea&s;on, than repug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">t to the &s;pirit of true religion.

<P>PROMPTED by this fanatical &s;pirit, or incited by the love of power and di&s;tinction, from which &s;uch pretenders to &s;uperior &s;anctity are not exempt, Loy|ola was ambitious of becoming the founder of a reli|gious order. The plan which he formed of its con|&s;titution and laws, was &s;ugge&s;ted, as he gave out, and as his followers &s;till teach, by the immediate in&s;piration of heaven <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Compte rendu des Con&s;titutions des Je&s;uites, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Parlement de Provence, par M. de Monclar. p. 285.</NOTE>. But notwith&s;tanding this high preten&s;ion, his de&s;ign met at fir&s;t with violent oppo&s;ition. The Pope, to whom Loyola had applied for the &s;anction of his authority to confirm the in&s;titution, referred his petition to a committee of Cardinals. They repre|&s;ented the e&s;tabli&s;hment to be unnece&s;&s;ary as well as dangerous, and Paul refu&s;ed to grant his approbation of it. At la&s;t, Loyola removed all his &s;cruples by an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">er which it was impo&s;&s;ible for any Pope to re&s;i&s;t. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ropo&s;ed that be&s;ides the three vows of poverty, of cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">y, and of mona&s;tic obedience, which are common to all mona&s;tic orders, the members of his &s;ociety &s;hould take a fourth vow of obedience to the Pope, binding them&s;elves to go whither&s;oever he &s;hould command for the &s;ervice of religion, and without re|quiring any thing from the Holy See for their &s;up|port. At a time when the papal authority had re|ceived &s;uch a &s;hock by the revolt of &s;o many nations from the Romi&s;h church; at a time when every part of the popi&s;h &s;y&s;tem was attacked with &s;o much vio|lence and &s;ucce&s;s, the acqui&s;ition of a body of men, thus peculiarly devoted to the &s;ee of Rome, and whom
<PB N="348" REF="011837_0750_0F9D8A3432B2DDD8">
it might &s;et in oppo&s;ition to all its enemies, was an object of the highe&s;t con&s;equence. Paul in&s;tantly per|ceived this, confirmed the in&s;titution of the Je&s;uits by his bull (September 27;) granted the mo&s;t ample pri|vileges to the members of the &s;ociety; and appointed Loyola to be the fir&s;t general of the order. The event had fully ju&s;tified Paul's di&s;cernment, in expecting &s;uch beneficial con&s;equences to the &s;ee of Rome from this in&s;titution. In le&s;s than half a century, the &s;oci|ety obtained e&s;tabli&s;hments in every country that ad|hered to the Roman catholic church; its power and wealth increa&s;ed amazingly; the number of its mem|bers became great; their character and accompli&s;h|ments were &s;till greater; and the Je&s;uits were cele|brated by the friends, and dreaded by the enemies of the Romi&s;h faith, as the mo&s;t able and enterprizing order in the church.</P>
<P>THE con&s;titution and laws of the &s;ociety were per|fected by Laynez and Aquavia, the two generals who &s;ucceeded Loyola, men far &s;uperior to their ma&s;ter in abilities, and in the &s;cience of government. They framed that &s;y&s;tem of profound and artful policy which di&s;tingui&s;hed the order. The large infu&s;ion of fanatici&s;m, mingled with its regulations, &s;hould be im|puted to Loyola its founder. Many circum&s;tances concurred in giving a peculiarity of character to the order of Je&s;uits, and in forming the members of it not only to take greater part in the affairs of the world than any other body of monks, but to acquire &s;uperi|or influence in the conduct of them.</P>
<P>THE primary object of almo&s;t all the mona&s;tic or|ders is to &s;eparate men from the world, and from any concern in its affairs. In the &s;olitude and &s;ilence of the cloi&s;ter, the monk is called to work out his own &s;alvation by extraordinary acts of mortification and piety. He is dead to the world, and ought not to min|gle in its tran&s;actions. He can be of no benefit to man|kind, but by his example and by his prayers. On the contrary, the Je&s;uits are taught to con&s;ider them&s;elves as formed for action. They are cho&s;en &s;oldiers, bound to exert them&s;elves continually in the &s;ervice of God, and of the Pope, his vicar on earth. Whatever tends
<PB N="349" REF="011837_0751_0F9D8A35327F94F0">
to in&s;truct the ignorant; whatever can be of u&s;e to reclaim or to oppo&s;e the enemies of the Holy See, is their proper object. That they may have full lei&s;ure for this active &s;ervice, they are totally exempted from tho&s;e functions, the performance of which is the chief bu&s;ine&s;s of other monks. They appear in no proce&s;&s;i|ons; they practi&s;e no rigorous au&s;terities; they do not con&s;ume one half of their time in the repetition of te|dious offices <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Compte Rendu, par M. de Monclar. p. 13. 290. Sur la de&s;truct. des Je|&s;uites, par M. D'Alembert, p. 42.</NOTE>. But they are required to attend to all the tran&s;actions of the world, on account of the influ|ence which the&s;e may have on religion; they are di|rected to &s;tudy the di&s;po&s;itions of per&s;ons in high rank, and to cultivate their friend&s;hip <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Compte par M. de Monclar. p. 12.</NOTE>; and by the very con&s;titution as well as genius of the order, a &s;pirit of action and intrigue is infu&s;ed into all its members.</P>
<P>AS the object of the &s;ociety of Je&s;uits differed from that of the other mona&s;tic orders, the diver&s;ity was no le&s;s in the form of its government. The other or|ders are to be con&s;idered as voluntary a&s;&s;ociations, in which whatever affects the whole body, is regulated by the common &s;uffrage of all its members. The ex|ecutive power is ve&s;ted in the per&s;ons placed at the head of each convent, or of the whole &s;ociety; the legi&s;lative authority re&s;ides in the community. Affairs of moment, relating to particular convents, are de|termined in conventual chapters; &s;uch as re&s;pect the whole order are con&s;idered in general congregations. But Loyola, full of the ideas of implicit obedience, which he had derived from his military profe&s;&s;ion, appointed that the government of his order &s;hould be purely monarchial. A General, cho&s;en for life by the deputies from the &s;everal provinces, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed power that was &s;upreme and independent, extending to e|very per&s;on, and to every ca&s;e. He, by his &s;ole au|thority nominated provincials, rectors, and every o|ther officer employed in the government of the &s;ocie|ty, and could remove them at plea&s;ure. In him was ve&s;ted the &s;overeign admini&s;tration of the revenues and funds of the order. Every member belonging to it was at his di&s;po&s;al; and by his uncontroulable man|date,
<PB N="350" REF="011837_0752_0F9D8A354DAD7ED0">
he could impo&s;e on them any ta&s;k, or employ them in what &s;ervice &s;oever he plea&s;ed. To his com|mands they were required to yield not only outward obedience, but to re&s;ign up to him the inclinations of their own wills, and the &s;entiments of their own un|der&s;tandings. They were to li&s;ten to his injunctions, as if they had been uttered by Chri&s;t him&s;elf. Under his direction, they were to be mere pa&s;&s;ive in&s;truments, like clay in the hands of the potter, or like dead car|ca&s;es incapable of re&s;i&s;tance <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Compte rendu au Parlem. de Bretagne, par M. de Chalotais, p. 41, &amp;c. Compte par M. de Monclar. 83. 185. 334.</NOTE>. Such a &s;ingular form of policy could not fail to impre&s;s its character on all the members of the order, and to give a peculiar force to all its operations. There is not in the annals of mankind any example of &s;uch a perfect de&s;poti&s;m, ex|erci&s;ed not over monks &s;hut up in the cells of a con|vent, but over men di&s;per&s;ed among all the nations of the earth.</P>
<P>AS the con&s;titutions of the order ve&s;t, in the Ge|neral, &s;uch ab&s;olute dominion over all its members, they carefully provide for his being perfectly informed with re&s;pect to the character and abilities of his &s;ub|jects. Every novice who offers him&s;elf as a candidate for entering into the order, is obliged to <HI>manife&s;t his con&s;cience</HI> to the &s;uperior, or to a per&s;on appointed by him: and is required to confe&s;s not only his &s;ins and defects, but to di&s;cover the inclinations, the pa&s;&s;ions, and the bent of his &s;oul. This manife&s;tation mu&s;t be renewed every &s;ix months <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Compte par M. de Monclar. p. 121, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The &s;ociety not &s;atisfi|ed with penetrating in this manner into the innermo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of the heart, directs each member to ob&s;erve the words and actions of the novices; they are con|&s;tituted &s;pies upon their conduct; and are bound to di&s;clo&s;e every thing of importance concerning them to the &s;uperior.

<P>AS it was the profe&s;&s;ed intention of the order of Je|&s;uits to labour with unwearied zeal in promoting the &s;alvation of men, this engaged them, of cour&s;e, in many active functions. From their fir&s;t in&s;titution, they con&s;idered the education of youth as their pecu|liar

province; they aimed at being &s;piritual guides and confe&s;&s;ors; they preached frequently in order to in&s;truct the people; they &s;et out as mi&s;&s;ionaries to con|vert unbelieving nations. The novelty of the in&s;titu|tion, as well as the &s;ingularity of its objects procured the Order many admirers and patrons. The govern|ors of the &s;ociety had the addre&s;s to avail them&s;elves of every circum&s;tance in its favour, and in a &s;hort time, the number as well as influence of its members increa&s;ed wonderfully. Before the expiration of the &s;ixteenth century, the Je&s;uits had obtained the chief direction of the education of youth in every catholic country in Europe. They had become the confe&s;&s;ors of almo&s;t all its monarchs, a function of no &s;mall im|portance in any reign, but under a weak Prince, &s;u|perior even to that of mini&s;ter. They were the &s;piri|tual guides of almo&s;t every per&s;on eminent for rank or power. They po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t degree of con|fidence and intere&s;t with the papal court, as the mo&s;t zealous and able champions for its authority. The advantages which an active and enterprizing body of men might derive from all the&s;e circum&s;tances are ob|vious. They formed the minds of men in their youth. They retained an a&s;cendant over them in their advanced years. They po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, at different periods, the direction of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable courts in Eu|rope. They mingled in all affairs. They took part in every intrigue and revolution. The General, by means of the exten&s;ive intelligence which he received, could regulate the operations of the order with the mo&s;t perfect di&s;cernment, and by means of his ab&s;o|lute power could carry them on with the utmo&s;t vi|gour and effect <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">When Lovola in the year 1540 petitioned the Pope to authorize the in&s;tituti|on of the order, he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ly ten di&s;ciples.

<P>TOGETHER with the power of the order, its wealth continued to increa&s;e. Various expedients were de|vi&s;ed for eluding the obligation of the vow of pover|ty.

The order acquired ample po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in every ca|tholic country; and by the number as well as magni|ficence of its publick buildings, together with the value of its property, moveable or real, it vied with the mo&s;t opulent of the mona&s;tic fraternities. Be&s;ides the &s;ources of wealth common to all the regular cler|gy, the Je&s;uits po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed one which was peculiar to them&s;elves. Under pretext of promoting the &s;ucce&s;s of their mi&s;&s;ions, and of facilitating the &s;upport of their mi&s;&s;ionaries, they obtained a &s;pecial licence from the court of Rome, to trade with the nations which they laboured to convert. In con&s;equence of this, they engaged in an exten&s;ive and lucrative commerce, both in the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies. They opened ware|hou&s;es in different parts of Europe, in which they vended their commodities. Not &s;atisfied with trade alone, they imitated the example of other commercial &s;ocieties, and aimed at obtaining &s;ettlements.

<P>UNHAPPILY for mankind, the va&s;t influence which the order of Je&s;uits acquired by all the&s;e different means, has been often exerted with the mo&s;t penicious effect. Such was the tendency of that di&s;cipline ob|&s;erved by the &s;ociety in forming its members, and &s;uch the fundamental maxims in its con&s;titution, that eve|ry Je&s;uit was taught to regard the intere&s;t of the or|der as the capital object, to which every con&s;ideration was to be &s;acrificed. This &s;pirit of attachment to their order, the mo&s;t ardent, perhaps, that ever influenc|ed any body of men <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Compte par M. de Moncl. p. 285.</NOTE>, is the characteri&s;tic principle of the Je&s;uits, and &s;erves as a key to the genius of their policy, and to the peculiarities in their &s;entiments and conduct.</P>
<P>AS it was for the honour and advantage of the &s;o|ciety, that its members &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s an a&s;cendant over per&s;ons in high rank or of great power, the de|&s;ire of acquiring and pre&s;erving &s;uch a direction of
<PB N="354" REF="011837_0756_0F9D8A3857A16C58">
their conduct, with greater facility, has led the Je&s;u|its to propagate a &s;y&s;tem of relaxed and pliant mora|lity, which accommodates it&s;elf to the pa&s;&s;ions of men, which ju&s;tifies their vices, which tolerates their im|perfections, which authorizes almo&s;t every action that the mo&s;t andacious or crafty politician would wi&s;h to perpetrate.</P>
<P>AS the pro&s;perity of the order was intimately connected with the pre&s;ervation of the papal authori|ty, the Je&s;uits, influenced by the &s;ame principle of attachment to the intere&s;ts of their &s;ociety, have been the mo&s;t zealous patrons of tho&s;e doctrines, which tend to exalt eccle&s;ia&s;tical power on the ruins of civil government. They have attributed to the court of Rome a juri&s;diction as exten&s;ive and ab&s;olute as was claimed by the mo&s;t pre&s;umptuous pontiffs in the dark ages. They have contended for the entire indepen|dence of eccle&s;ia&s;ticks on the civil magi&s;trate. They have publi&s;hed &s;uch tenets concerning the duty of op|po&s;ing Princes who were enemies of the catholic faith, as countenanced the mo&s;t atrocious crimes, and tend|ed to di&s;&s;olve all the ties which connect &s;ubjects with their rulers.</P>
<P>AS the order derived both reputation and authori|ty from the zeal with which it &s;tood forth in defence of the Romi&s;h church again&s;t the attacks of the reform|ers, its members, proud of this di&s;tinction, have con|&s;idered it as their peculiar function to combat the o|pinions, and to check the progre&s;s of the Prote&s;tants. They have made u&s;e of every art, and have employed every weapon again&s;t them. They have &s;et them|&s;elves in oppo&s;ition to every gentle or tolerating mea|&s;ure in their favour. They have ince&s;&s;antly &s;tirred up again&s;t them all the rage of eccle&s;ia&s;tical and civil per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>MONKS of other denominations have, indeed, ven|tured to teach the &s;ame pernicious doctrines, and have held opinions equally incon&s;i&s;tent with the order and happine&s;s of civil &s;ociety. But they, from rea&s;ons which are obvious, have either delivered &s;uch opini|ons with greater re&s;erve, or have propagated them with le&s;s &s;ucce&s;s. Whoever recollects the events which
<PB N="355" REF="011837_0757_0F9D8A391D52C278">
have happened in Europe during two centuries, will find that the Je&s;uits may ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as re|&s;pon&s;ible for mo&s;t of the pernicious effects ari&s;ing from that corrupt and dangerous ca&s;ui&s;try, from tho&s;e ex|travagant tenets concerning eccle&s;ia&s;tical power, and from that intolerant &s;pirit, which have been the di&s;|grace of the church of Rome throughout that period, and which have brought &s;o many calamities upon ci|vil &s;ociety <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Encyclopedie, Art, <HI>Je&s;uites,</HI> tom. viii. 513.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT amid&s;t many bad con&s;equences flowing from the in&s;titution of this order, mankind, it mu&s;t be ac|knowledged, have derived from it &s;ome con&s;iderable advantages. As the Je&s;uits made the education of youth one of their capital objects, and as their fir&s;t at|tempts to e&s;tabli&s;h colleges for the reception of &s;tu|dents were violently oppo&s;ed by the univer&s;ities in different countries, it became nece&s;&s;ary for them, as the mo&s;t effectual method of acquiring the publick fa|vour, to &s;urpa&s;s their rivals in &s;cience and indu&s;try. This prompted them to cultivate with great ardour the &s;tudy of ancient literature. This put them upon various methods for facilitating the in&s;truction of youth; and by the improvements which they made in it, they have contributed not a little towards the progre&s;s of polite learning, and have on this account me rited well of &s;ociety. Nor has the order of Je&s;uits been &s;ucce&s;sful only in teaching the elements of litera|ture, it has produced likewi&s;e eminent ma&s;ters in many branches of &s;cience, and can alone boa&s;t of a greater number of ingenious authors, than all the other reli|gious fraternities taken together <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">M. d'Alembert has ob&s;erved that though the Je&s;uits have made extraordina|ry progre&s;s in erudition of every &s;pecies; though they can reckon up many of their brethren who have been eminent mathematicians, antiquarians, and criticks; though they have even formed &s;ome orators of reputation; yet the order has ne|ver produced one man, who&s;e mind was &s;o much enlightened with &s;ound know|ledge, as to merit the name of a philo&s;opher. But it &s;eems to be the unavoidable effect of mona&s;tick education to contract and fetter the human mind. The partial attachment of a monk to the intere&s;t of his order, which is often incompatible with that of other citizens; the habit of implicit obedience to the will of a &s;uperi|or, together with the frequent return of the weari&s;ome and frivolous duties of the cloi&s;ter, deba&s;e his faculties, and extingui&s;h that genero&s;ity of &s;entiment and &s;pi|rit, which qualifies men for thinking or feeling ju&s;tly with repect to what is pro|per in life and conduct. Father Paul of Venice is, perhaps, the only per&s;on edu|cated in a cloi&s;ter, that ever was altogether &s;uperior to its prejudices, or who re|newed the tran&s;actions of men, and rea&s;oned concerning the intere&s;ts of &s;ociety, with the enlarged &s;entiments of a philo&s;opher, with the di&s;cernment of a man conver&s;ant in affairs, and with the liberality of a gentleman.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="356" REF="011837_0758_0F9D8A3A01F5C520">BUT it is in the new world that the Je&s;uits have ex|hibited the mo&s;t wonderful di&s;play of their abilities, and have contributed mo&s;t effectually to the benefit of the human &s;pecies. The conquerors of that unfortu|nate quarter of the globe had nothing in view but to plunder, to en&s;lave, and to exterminate its inhabitants. The Je&s;uits alone have made humanity the object of their &s;ettling there. About the beginning of the la&s;t century they obtained admi&s;&s;ion into the fertile pro|vince of Paraguay, which &s;tretches acro&s;s the &s;outh|ern continent of America, from the bottom of the mountains of Poto&s;i to the confines of the Spani&s;h and Portugue&s;e &s;ettlements on the banks of the river de la Plata: they found the inhabitants in a &s;tate little different from that which takes place among men when they fir&s;t begin to unite together; &s;trangers to the arts; &s;ub&s;i&s;ting precariou&s;ly by hunting or fi&s;hing; and &s;carce acquainted with the fir&s;t principles of &s;ub|ordination and government. The Je&s;uits &s;et them|&s;elves to in&s;truct and to civili&s;e the&s;e &s;avages. They taught them to cultivate the ground, to rear tame animals, and to build hou&s;es. They brought them to live together in villages. They trained them to arts and manufactures. They made them ta&s;te the &s;weets of &s;ociety; and accu&s;tomed them to the ble&s;&s;ings of &s;ecurity and order. The&s;e people became the &s;ubjects of their benefactors; who have governed them with a tender attention, re&s;embling that, with which a fa|ther directs his children. Re&s;pected and beloved al|mo&s;t to adoration, a few Je&s;uits pre&s;ided over &s;ome hundred thou&s;and Indians. They maintained a per|fect equality among all the members of the community. Each of them was obliged to labour not for him&s;elf alone but for the public. The produce of their fields, together with the fruits of their indu&s;try of every &s;pe|cies, were depo&s;ited in common &s;torehou&s;es, from which each individual received every thing nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upply of his wants. By this in&s;titution, al|mo&s;t all the pa&s;&s;ions which di&s;turb the peace of &s;ociety,

and render the members of it unhappy, were extin+gui&s;hed. A few magi&s;trates, cho&s;en by the Indians them&s;elves, watched over the publick tranquillity, and &s;ecured obedience to the laws. The &s;anguinary pu|ni&s;hments frequent under other governments were unknown. An admonition from a Je&s;uit; a &s;light mark of infamy; or, on &s;ome &s;ingular occa&s;ion, a few la&s;hes with a whip, were &s;ufficient to maintain good order among the&s;e innocent and happy people <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. de Paraguay par Pere de Charlevoix, tom. ii. 42. &amp;c.

<P>BUT even in this meritorious effort of the Je&s;uits for the good of mankind, the genius and &s;pirit of their order have mingled and are di&s;cernible. They plain|ly aimed at e&s;tabli&s;hing in Paraguay an independant empire, &s;ubject to the &s;ociety alone, and which, by the &s;uperior excellence of its con&s;titution and police, could &s;carce have failed to extend its dominion over all the &s;outhern continent of America. With this view, in order to prevent the Spaniards or Portu|gue&s;e in the adjacent &s;ettlements, from acquiring any influence over the people whom they governed that might be dangerous, the Je&s;uits endeavoured to in|&s;pire the Indians with hatred and contempt of the&s;e nations. They cut off all intercour&s;e between their &s;ubjects and the Spani&s;h or Portugue&s;e &s;ettlements. They prohibited any private trader of either nation from entering their territories. When they were obliged to admit any per&s;on in a publick character from the neighbouring governments, they did not permit him to have any conver&s;ation with their &s;ub|jects, and no Indian was allowed even to enter the hou&s;e where the&s;e &s;trangers re&s;ided, unle&s;s in the pre|&s;ence of a Je&s;uit. In order to render any communica|tion between them as difficult as po&s;&s;ible, they indu&s;|triou&s;ly avoided giving the Indians any knowledge of the Spani&s;h or any other European language; but en|couraged the different tribes, which they had civilized, to acquire a certain dialect of the Indian tongue, and laboured to make that the univer&s;al language through|out their dominions. As all the&s;e precautions, with|out
<PB N="358" REF="011837_0760_0F9D8A3D82ECCF50">
military force, would have been in&s;ufficient to have rendered their empire &s;ecure and permanent, they in&s;tructed their &s;ubjects in the European arts of war. They formed them into bodies of cavalry and infantry, completely armed and regularly di&s;ciplined. They provided a great train of artillery, as well as magazines &s;tored with all the implements of war. Thus they e&s;tabli&s;hed an army &s;o numerous and well appointed, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> be formidable in a country, where a few &s;ickly and ill-di&s;ciplined battalions compo&s;ed all military force kept on foot by the Spaniards or Por|tugue&s;e <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Juan &amp; de Ulloa, tom. i. 549.

<P>THE Je&s;uits gained no con&s;iderable degree of power during the reign of Charles V. who, with his u&s;ual &s;agacity, di&s;cerned the dangerous tendency of the in|&s;titution, and checked its progre&s;s <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Compte par M. de Moncl. p. 312.</NOTE>.

Europe had ob|&s;erved, for two centuries, the ambition and power of the order. But while it felt many fatal effects of the&s;e, it could not fully di&s;cern the cau&s;es to which they were to be imputed. It was unacquainted with many of the &s;ingular regulations in the political con&s;titution or government of the Je&s;uits, which formed that &s;pi|rit of intrigue and enterprize which di&s;tingui&s;hed its members, and elevated the body it&s;elf to &s;uch a height of power. It was a favourite maxim with the Je&s;uits, from their fir&s;t in&s;titution, not to publi&s;h the rules of their order. The&s;e they kept concealed as an impe|netrable my&s;tery. They never communicated them to &s;trangers; nor even to the greater part of their own members.

<P>NO &s;ooner had Charles re-e&s;tabli&s;hed order in the
<PB N="360" REF="011837_0762_0F9D8A3E60EECD28">
Low-Countries, than he was obliged to turn his atten|tion to the affairs of Germany. The Prote&s;tants pre&s;&s;ed him earne&s;tly to appoint that conference betwen a &s;e|lect number of the divines of each party, which had been &s;tipulated in the convention at Frankfort. The Pope, con&s;idering &s;uch an attempt to examine or de|cide the points in di&s;pute as derogatory to his right of being the &s;upreme judge in controver&s;y, and per&s;uad|ed that it would either be ineffectual by determining nothing, or prove dangerous by determining too much, employed every art to prevent the meeting. The Emperor, however, finding it more for his intere&s;t to &s;ooth the Germans, than to gratify Paul, paid little regard to his remon&s;trances. In a diet held at Haguenaw, matters were ripened for the conference. In another diet a&s;&s;embled at Worms, the conference was begun, Melancthon on the one &s;ide and Eckius on the other, &s;u&s;taining the principal part in the di&s;pute; but after they had made &s;ome progre&s;s, though with|out concluding any thing, it was &s;u&s;pended by the Emperor's command, Dec. 6, that it might be renew|ed with greater &s;olemnity in his own pre&s;ence in a di|et &s;ummoned to meet at Rati&s;bon, 1541. This a&s;|&s;embly was opened with great pomp, and with a ge|neral expectation that its proceedings would be vigo|rous and deci&s;ive. By the con&s;ent of both parties, the Emperor was entru&s;ted with the power of nominating the per&s;ons who &s;hould manage the conference, which it was agreed &s;hould be conducted not in the form of a public di&s;putation, but as a friendly &s;crutiny or exa|mination into the articles which had given ri&s;e to the pre&s;ent controver&s;ies. He appointed Eckius, Gropper and Pflug, on the part of the Catholicks, and Me|lacthon, Bucer and Pi&s;torius, on that of the Prote|&s;tants, all men of di&s;tingui&s;hed reputation among their own adherents, and, except Eckius, all eminent for their moderation, as well as de&s;irous of peace. As they were about to begin their con&s;ultations, the Em|peror put into their hands a book, compo&s;ed, as he &s;aid, by a learned divine in the Low-Countries, with &s;uch extraordinary per&s;picuity and temper, as might go far, in his opinion, to unite and comprehend the
<PB N="361" REF="011837_0763_0F9D8A3F1D42EBC8">
two contending parties. Gropper, a canon of Cologne, whom he had named among the managers of the con|ference, a man of addre&s;s as well as of erudition, was afterwards &s;u&s;pected to be the author of this &s;hort treati&s;e. It contained po&s;itions with regard to twenty-two of the chief articles in theology, which included mo&s;t of the que&s;tions then agitated in the controver&s;y between the Lutherans and the church of Rome. By ranging his &s;entiments in a natural order, and expre&s;|&s;ing them with great &s;implicity; by employing often the very words of &s;cripture, or of the primitive fathers; by &s;oftening the rigour of &s;ome opinions, and explaining away what was ab&s;urd in others; by conce&s;&s;ions, now on one &s;ide, and now on the other; and e&s;pecially by bani&s;hing as much as po&s;&s;ible &s;chola&s;tic phra&s;es, tho&s;e words and terms of art in controver&s;y, which &s;erve as badges of di&s;tinction to the different &s;ects, and for which theologians often contend more fiercely than for opinions them&s;elves; he framed his work in &s;uch a manner, as promi&s;ed fairer than any thing that had hitherto been attempted, to compo&s;e and to terminate religious di&s;&s;en&s;ions <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Golda&s;t. Con&s;tit. Imper. ii. p. 182.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the attention of the age was turned, with &s;uch acute ob&s;ervation, towards theological contro|ver&s;ies, that it was not ea&s;y to impo&s;e on it by any glo&s;s how artful or &s;pecious &s;oever. The length and eagerne&s;s of the di&s;pute had &s;eparated the contending parties &s;o compleatly, and had &s;et their minds at &s;uch variance, that they were not to be reconciled by par|tial conce&s;&s;ions. All the zealous Catholics, particu|larly the eccle&s;ia&s;tics who had a &s;eat in the diet, join|ed in condemning Gropper's treati&s;e as too favourable to the Lutheran opinions, the poi&s;on of which here&s;y it conveyed, as they pretended, with greater danger, becau&s;e it was in &s;ome degree di&s;gui&s;ed. The rigid Prote&s;tants, e&s;pecially Luther him&s;elf, and his patron, the Elector of Saxony, were for rejecting it as an im|pious compound of error and truth, craftily prepared that it might impo&s;e on the weak, the timid, and the unthinking. But the divines, to whom the examina|tion
<PB N="362" REF="011837_0764_0F9D8A4014E94968">
of it was committed, entered upon that bu&s;ine&s;s with greater deliberation and temper. As it was more ea&s;y in it&s;elf, as well as more con&s;i&s;tent with the dignity of the church to make conce&s;&s;ions, and even alterati|ons with regard to &s;peculative opinions, the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion whereof is confined chiefly to &s;chools, and which pre|&s;ent nothing to the people that either &s;trikes their ima|gination or affects their &s;en&s;es, they came to an accom|modation about tho&s;e without much labour, and even defined the great article concerning ju&s;tification to their mutual &s;atisfaction. But, when they proceeded to points of juri&s;diction, where the intere&s;t and authori|ty of the Roman See were concerned, or the rites and forms of external wor&s;hip, where every change that could be made mu&s;t be public, and draw the ob&s;erva|tion of the people, there the Catholics were altogether untractable; nor could the church either with &s;afety or with honour aboli&s;h its ancient in&s;titutions. All the articles relative to the power of the Pope, the au|thority of councils, the admini&s;tration of the &s;acra|ments, the wor&s;hip of &s;aints, and many other parti|culars did not, in their nature, admit of any tempe|rament; &s;o that after labouring long to bring about an accommodation with re&s;pect to the&s;e, the Emperor found all his endeavours ineffectual. Being impati|ent, however, to clo&s;e the diet, July 28, he at la&s;t prevailed on a majority of the members to approve of the following rece&s;s; "That the articles concerning which the divines had agreed in the conference, &s;hould be held as points decided, and be ob&s;erved inviolably by all; that the other articles about which they had differed, &s;hould be referred to the determination of a general council, or if that could not be obtained, to a national &s;ynod of Germany; and if it &s;hould prove impracticable, likewi&s;e to a&s;&s;emble a &s;ynod, that a general diet of the Empire &s;hould be called with|in eighteen months, in order to give &s;ome final judg|ment upon the whole controver&s;y; that the Empe|ror &s;hould u&s;e all his intere&s;t and authority with the Pope, to procure the meeting either of a general council or &s;ynod; that in the mean time, no innova|tions &s;hould be attempted, no endeavours &s;hould be

<P>ALL the proceedings of this diet, as well as the re|ce&s;s in which they terminated, gave great offence to the Pope. The power which the Germans had a&s;|&s;umed of appointing their own divines to examine and determine matters of controver&s;y, he con&s;idered as a very dangerous inva&s;ion on his rights; the renewing of their ancient propo&s;al concerning a national &s;ynod, which had been &s;o often rejected by him and his pre|dece&s;&s;ors, appeared extremely undutiful; but the bare mention of allowing a diet, compo&s;ed chiefly of laymen, to pa&s;s judgment with re&s;pect to articles of faith, was deemed no le&s;s criminal and profane, than the wor&s;t of tho&s;e here&s;ies which they &s;eemed zealous to &s;uppre&s;s. On the other hand, the Prote&s;tants were no le&s;s di&s;&s;atisfied with a rece&s;s, which con&s;iderably abridged the liberty which they enjoyed at that time. As they murmured loudly again&s;t it, Charles, unwill|ing to leave any &s;eeds of di&s;content in the Empire, granted them a private declaration, in the mo&s;t ample terms, exempting them from whatever they thought oppre&s;&s;ive or injurious in the rece&s;s, and a&s;certaining to them the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the privileges which they had ever enjoyed <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 283.

<P>EXTRAORDINARY as the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions may appear, the &s;ituation of his affairs at this juncture made it ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the Emperor to grant them. He fore&s;aw a rupture with France to be unavoidable, as well as near at hand, and dur&s;t not give any &s;uch cau&s;e of di&s;gu&s;t or fear to the Prote&s;tants, as might force them, in &s;elf-defence. to court the protection of the French King, from whom, at pre&s;ent, they were much alienated. The rapid progre&s;s of the Turks in Hungary, was a more powerful and pre&s;ent cau&s;e of the moderation which Charles di&s;covered. A great revolution had happened in that kingdom; John Za|pol Scaepus having cho&s;en, as has been related, rather

to po&s;&s;e&s;s a tributary kingdom, than to renounce the royal dignity to which he had been accu&s;tomed, had, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his mighty protector Solyman, wre&s;ted from Ferdinand a great part of the country, and left him only the precarious po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the re&s;t. But being a prince of pacific qualities, the frequent attempts of Ferdinand, or of his partizans among the Hungarians, to recover what they had lo&s;t, gave him great pain; and the nece&s;&s;ity, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, of calling in the Turks, whom he con&s;idered and felt to be his ma&s;ters rather than auxiliaries, were &s;carce le&s;s mortifying. In order, therefore, to avoid the&s;e di&s;|tre&s;&s;es, and to &s;ecure quiet and lei&s;ure to enjoy the arts and amu&s;ements in which he delighted, he &s;ecret|ly came to an agreement with his competitor, on this condition; That Ferdinand &s;hould acknowledge him as King of Hungary, and leave him, during life, the unmole&s;ted po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that part of the kingdom now in his power; but that, upon his demi&s;e, the &s;ole right to the whole &s;hould devolve upon Ferdinand <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">I&s;luanhaffi Hi&s;t. Hung. lib. xii p. 135.</NOTE>. As John had never been married, and was then far advanced in life, the terms of the contract &s;eemed ve|ry favourable to Ferdinand. But, &s;oon after, &s;ome of the Hungarian nobles, &s;ollicitous to prevent a fo|reigner from a&s;cending their throne, prevailed on John to put an end to a long celibacy, by marrying I&s;abella, the daughter of Sigi&s;mond, King of Poland. John had the &s;atisfaction, before his death, which happened within le&s;s than a year thereafter, to &s;ee a &s;on born to inherit his kingdom. To him, with|out regarding his treaty with Ferdinand, which he con&s;idered, no doubt, as void, upon an event not fore&s;een when it was concluded, he bequeathed his crown; appointing the Queen and George Martinuz|zi, bi&s;hop of Waradin, guardians of his &s;on; and re|gents of the kingdom. The greater part of the Hun|garians immediately acknowledged the young King, to whom, in memory of the founder of their monar|chy, they gave the name of Stephen <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Jovii Hi&s;t. lib. 39. p. 239, a. &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="011837_0767_0F9D8A420C2A0380">FERDINAND, though extremely di&s;concerted by this unexpected event, re&s;olved not to abandon the kingdom which he had acquired by his compact with John. He &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to the Queen to claim po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and to offer the province of Tran&s;ylvania as a &s;ettlement for her &s;on, preparing at the &s;ame time to a&s;&s;ert his right by force of arms. But John had committed the care of his &s;on to per&s;ons, who had too much &s;pirit to give up the crown tamely, and who po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed abilities &s;ufficient to defend it. The Queen, to all the addre&s;s peculiar to her own &s;ex, added a ma&s;cu|line courage, ambition, and magnanimity. Marti|nuzzi, who had rai&s;ed him&s;elf from the lowe&s;t rank in life to his pre&s;ent dignity, was one of tho&s;e extra|ordinary men, who by the extent as well as variety of their talents, are fitted to act a &s;uperior part in bu&s;tling and factious times. In di&s;charging the func|tions of his eccle&s;ia&s;tical office, he put on the &s;em|blance of an humble and au&s;tere &s;anctity. He di&s;co|vered, in civil tran&s;actions, indu&s;try, dexterity and boldne&s;s. During war he laid a&s;ide the ca&s;&s;ock, and appeared on hor&s;eback with his &s;cymeter and buckler, as active, as o&s;tentatious, and as gallant as any of his countrymen. Amid&s;t all the&s;e different and contra|dictory forms which he could a&s;&s;ume, an in&s;atiable de|&s;ire of dominion and authority was con&s;picuous. From &s;uch per&s;ons it was obvious what an&s;wer Ferdi|nand had to expect. He &s;oon perceived that he mu&s;t depend on arms alone for recovering Hungary. Hav|ing levied for this purpo&s;e a con&s;iderable body of Germans, whom his partizans among the Hungarians joined with their va&s;&s;als, he ordered them to march into that part of the kingdom which adhered to Ste|phen. Martinuzzi, unable to make head again&s;t &s;uch a powerful army in the field, &s;atisfied him&s;elf with holding out the towns, all of which, e&s;pecially Buda, the place of greate&s;t con&s;equence, he provided with every thing nece&s;&s;ary for defence; and in the mean time he &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to Solyman, be &s;eeching him to extend towards the &s;on, the &s;ame Imperial protection which had &s;o long maintained the father on his throne. The Sultan, though Ferdinand u&s;ed his utmo&s;t en|deavours

to thwart this negociation, and even offered to accept of the Hungarian crown on the &s;ame ignomi|nious condition of paying tribute to the Ottoman Porte, by which John had held it, &s;aw &s;uch pro&s;pects of advantage from e&s;pou&s;ing the intere&s;t of the young King, that he in&s;tantly promi&s;ed him his protection; and commanding one army to advance towards Hun|gary, he him&s;elf followed with another. Meanwhile the Germans, hoping to terminate the war by the re|duction of a city in which the King and his mother were &s;hut up, had formed the &s;iege of Buda. Marti|nuzzi, having drawn thither the &s;trength of the Hun|garian nobility, defended the town with &s;uch courage and &s;kill, as allowed the Turki&s;h forces time to come up to his relief. They in&s;tantly attacked the Ger|mans, weakened by fatigue, di&s;ea&s;es and de&s;ertion, and defeated them with great &s;laughter <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">I&s;luanhaffi. hi&s;t.

<P>SOLYMAN &s;oon after joined his victorious troops, and being weary of &s;o many expen&s;ive expeditions undertaken in defence of dominions which were not his own, or being unable to re&s;i&s;t this alluring opportu|nity of &s;eizing a kingdom, while po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by an in|fant, under the guardian&s;hip of a woman and a prie&s;t, he allowed intere&s;ted con&s;iderations to triumph with too much facility over the principles of honour and the &s;entiments of humanity. What he planned un|generou&s;ly, he executed by fraud. Having prevailed on the Queen to &s;end her &s;on, whom he pretended to be de&s;irous of &s;eeing, into his camp, and having at the &s;ame time invited the chief of the nobility to an entertainment there, while they, &s;u&s;pecting no trea|chery, gave them&s;elves up to the mirth and jollity of the fea&s;t, a &s;elect band of troops by the Sultan's orders &s;eized one of the gates of Buda. Being thus ma&s;ter of the capital, of the King's per&s;on and of the leading men among the nobles, he ordered the Queen toge|ther with her &s;on to be conducted to Tran&s;ylvania, which province he allotted to them, and appointing a Ba&s;ha to re&s;ide in Buda with a large body of &s;oldiers, annexed Hungary to the Ottoman Empire.

<P>BEFORE the account of this violent u&s;urpation reached Ferdinand he was &s;o unlucky as to have di&s;|patched new amba&s;&s;adors to Solyman with a fre&s;h re|pre&s;entation of his right to the crown of Hungary, as well as a renewal of his former overture to hold the kingdom, of the Ottoman Porte, and to pay for it an annual tribute. This ill-timed propo&s;al was rejected with &s;corn. The Sultan elated with &s;ucce&s;s, and thinking that he might pre&s;cribe what terms he plea&s;ed to a prince who voluntarily profered conditions &s;o un|becoming his own dignity, declared that he would not &s;u&s;pend the operations of war, unle&s;s Ferdinand in&s;tantly evacuated all the towns which he held in Hungary, and con&s;ented to the impo&s;ition of a tribute upon Au&s;tria, in order to reimbur&s;e the &s;ums, which his pre&s;umptuous inva&s;ion of Hungary had obliged the Ottoman Porte to expend in defence of that king|dom <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">I&s;luanhaffi. hi&s;t.

<P>SUCH was the &s;tate of affairs in Hungary. As the unfortunate events there had either happened before the di&s;&s;olution of the diet at Rati&s;bon, or were dread|ed at that time, Charles &s;aw the danger of irritating and inflaming the minds of the Germans, while &s;uch a formidable enemy was ready to break into the Em|pire; and perceived that he could not expect any vigor|ous a&s;&s;i&s;tance either towards the recovery of Hungary or the defence of the Au&s;trian frontiers, unle&s;s he courted and &s;atisfied the Prote&s;tants. By the conce&s;|&s;ions which have been mentioned, he gained this point, and &s;uch liberal &s;upplies both of men and money were voted for carrying on the war again&s;t the Turks, as left him under little anxiety about the &s;ecurity of Germany during next campaign <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 283.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY upon the conclu&s;ion of the diet, the Emperor &s;et out for Italy. As he pa&s;&s;ed through Lucca he had a &s;hort interview with the Pope, but nothing could be concluded concerning the proper
<PB N="368" REF="011837_0770_0F9D8A445E0FA9D8">
method of compo&s;ing the religious di&s;putes in Ger|many, between two princes who&s;e views and intere&s;t with regard to that matter were at this juncture &s;o oppo&s;ite. The Pope's endeavours to remove the cau&s;es of di&s;cord between Charles and Francis, and to extingui&s;h all tho&s;e mutual animo&s;ities which threaten|ed to break out &s;uddenly into open ho&s;tility, were not more &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>THE Emperor's thoughts were bent &s;o entirely, at that time, on the great enterprize which he had concerted again&s;t Algiers, that he li&s;tened with little attention to the Pope's &s;chemes or overtures, and ha&s;tened to join his army and fleet <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Sandov. hi&s;tor. tom. ii. 298</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ALGIERS &s;till continued in that &s;tate of dependence on the Turki&s;h empire to which Barbaro&s;&s;a had &s;ub|jected it. Ever &s;ince he, as captain Ba&s;ha, command|ed the Ottoman fleet, Algiers had been governed by Ha&s;cen-Aga, a renegado eunuch, who by pa&s;&s;ing through every &s;tation in the Cor&s;airs &s;ervice, had ac|quired great experience in war, and was well fitted for a &s;tation which required a man of tried and daring courage. Ha&s;cen, in order to &s;hew how well he de|&s;erved that dignity, carried on his piratical depredati|ons again&s;t the Chri&s;tian &s;tates with amazing activity, and out-did, if po&s;&s;ible, Barbaro&s;&s;a him&s;elf in boldne&s;s and cruelty. The commerce of the Mediterranean was greatly interrupted by his crui&s;ers, and &s;uch fre|quent alarms given to the coa&s;ts of Spain, that there was a nece&s;&s;ity of erecting watch-towers at proper di&s;|tances, and of keeping guards con&s;tantly on foot, in order to di&s;cry the approach of his &s;quadrons, and to protect the inhabitants from their de&s;cents <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Jovii hi&s;t. l. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">. p. 266.</NOTE>. Of this the Emperor's &s;ubjects had long complained, repre|&s;enting it as an enterprize corre&s;ponding to his power, and becoming his humanity, to reduce Algiers, which &s;ince the conque&s;t of Tunis, was the common recep|tacle of all the free booters; and to exterminate that lawle&s;s race, the implacable enemies of the Chri&s;tian name. Moved partly by their intreaties, and party allured by the hope of adding to the glory which he had acquired by his la&s;t expedition into Africa, Charles
<PB N="369" REF="011837_0771_0F9D8A4508886AF0">
before he left Madrid in his way to the Low-Countries, had i&s;&s;ued orders both in Spain and Italy to prepare a fleet and army for this purpo&s;e. No change in cir|cum&s;tances, &s;ince that time, could divert him from this re&s;olution, or prevail on him to turn his arms to|wards Hungary; though the &s;ucce&s;s of the Turks in that country &s;eemed more immediately to require his pre&s;ence there; though many of his mo&s;t faithful ad|herents in Germany urged that the defence of the Empire ought to be his fir&s;t and peculiar care; though &s;uch as bore him no good will ridiculed his prepo&s;te|rous conduct in flying from an enemy almo&s;t at hand, that he might go in que&s;t of a remote and more igno|ble foe. But to attack the Sultan in Hungary, how &s;plendid &s;oever that mea&s;ure might appear, was an undertaking which exceeded his power, and was not con&s;i&s;tent with his intere&s;t. To draw troops out of Spain or Italy, to march them into a country &s;o di&s;|tant as Hungary, to provide the va&s;t apparatus nece&s;|&s;ary for tran&s;porting thither the artillery, ammuniti|on and baggage of a regular army, and to pu&s;h the war in that quarter, where it could &s;carce be brought to any i&s;&s;ue during &s;everal campaigns, were under|takings &s;o exten&s;ive and unwieldly as did not corre&s;|pond with the low condition of the Emperor's trea&s;u|ry. While his principal force was thus employed, his dominions in Italy and the Low-countries mu&s;t have lain open to the French King, who would not have allowed &s;uch a favourable opportunity of attack|ing them to go unimproved. Whereas the African expedition, the preparations for which were already fini&s;hed and almo&s;t the whole expence of it defrayed, would depend upon a &s;ingle effort, and be&s;ides the &s;e|curity and &s;atisfiaction which the &s;ucce&s;s of it mu&s;t give his &s;ubjects, would detain him during &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace, that Francis could &s;carce take advantage of his ab&s;ence, to invade his dominions in Europe.</P>
<P>ON all the&s;e accounts, Charles adhered to his fir&s;t plan, and with &s;uch determined ob&s;tinacy, that he paid no regard to the Pope who advi&s;ed, or to An|drew Doria who conjured him not to expo&s;e his whole armament to almo&s;t unavoidable de&s;truction, by ven|turing

at &s;uch an advanced &s;ea&s;on of the year, and while the autumnal winds were &s;o violent, to ap|proach the dangerous coa&s;t of Algiers. Having em|barked on board Doria's gallies at Porto Venere in the Genoe&s;e territories, he &s;oon found that this experien|ced &s;ailor had not judged wrong concerning the ele|ment with which he was &s;o well acquainted; for &s;uch a &s;torm aro&s;e that it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty and danger he reached Sardinia, the place of general rendezvous. But as his courage was undaunted, and his temper often inflexible, neither the remon&s;trances of the Pope and Doria, nor the danger to which he had already been expo&s;ed by di&s;regarding them, had any other effect than to confirm him in his fatal re&s;o|lution. The force, indeed, which he had collected was &s;uch as might have in&s;pired a Prince le&s;s adven|turous, and le&s;s confident in his own &s;chemes, with the mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes of &s;ucce&s;s. It con&s;i&s;ted of twenty thou&s;and foot and two thou&s;and hor&s;e, Spa|niards, Italians and Germans, mo&s;tly veterans, toge|ther with three thou&s;and volunteers, the flower of the Spani&s;h and Italian nobility, fond of paying court to the Emperor by attending him in this favourite expe|dition, and eager to &s;hare in the glory which they be|lieved he was going to reap; to the&s;e were added a thou&s;and &s;oldiers &s;ent from Malta by the order of St. John, led by an hundred of its mo&s;t gallant Knights.</P>
<P>THE voyage, from Majorca to the African coa&s;t, was not le&s;s tedious, or full of hazard, than that which he had ju&s;t fini&s;hed. When he approached the land, the roll of the &s;ea, and vehemence of the winds, would not permit the troops to di&s;embark. But at la&s;t, the Emperor &s;eizing a favourable opportunity, landed them without oppo&s;ition, not far from Al|giers, and immediately advanced towards the town. To oppo&s;e this mighty army, Ha&s;cen had only eight hundred Turks, and five thou&s;and Moors, partly na|tives of Africa, and partly refugees from Granada. He returned, however, a fierce and haughty an&s;wer when &s;ummoned to &s;urrender. But with &s;uch a handful of &s;oldiers, neither his de&s;perate courage, nor con&s;ummate &s;kill in war could have long re&s;i&s;ted
<PB N="371" REF="011837_0773_0F9D8A4687ABDA18">
forces &s;uperior to tho&s;e which had defeated Barbaro&s;|&s;a at the head of &s;ixty thou&s;and men, and had reduc|ed Tunis, in &s;pite of all his endeavours to &s;ave it.</P>
<P>BUT how far &s;oever the Emperor might think him|&s;elf beyond the reach of any danger from the enemy, he was &s;uddenly expo&s;ed to a more dreadful calami|ty, and one again&s;t which human prudence, and hu|man efforts availed nothing. On the &s;econd day af|ter his landing, and before he had time for any thing but to di&s;per&s;e &s;ome light armed Arabs who mole&s;ted his troops on their march, the clouds began to gather, and the heavens to appear with a fierce and threat|ning a&s;pect. Towards evening rain began to fall, ac|companied with violent wind, and the rage of the tem|pe&s;t increa&s;ing during the night, the &s;oldiers, who had brought nothing a&s;hore but their arms, remained expo&s;ed to all its fury without tents, or &s;helter, or cover of any kind. The ground was &s;o wet that they could not lie down on it; their camp being in a low &s;ituation was overflowed with water, and they &s;unk at every &s;tept to the ancles in mud; while the wind blew with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that to prevent their falling they were obliged to thru&s;t their &s;pears into the ground, and to &s;upport them&s;elves by tak|ing hold of them. Ha&s;cen was too vigilant an officer to allow an enemy in &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s to remain unmole&s;t|ed. About the dawn of morning, he &s;allied out with &s;oldiers, who having been &s;creened from the &s;torm under their own roofs, were fre&s;h and vigorous. A body of Italians who were &s;tationed neare&s;t the city, di&s;pirited and benumbed with cold, fled at the ap|proach of the Turks. The troops at the po&s;t behind them, di&s;covered greater courage, but as the rain had extingui&s;hed their matches and wet their powder, their mu&s;kets were u&s;ele&s;s, and having &s;carce &s;trength to handle their other arms, they were &s;oon thrown in|to confu&s;ion. Almo&s;t the whole army, with the Em|peror him&s;elf in per&s;on, was obliged to advance be|fore the enemy could be repul&s;ed, who, after &s;preading &s;uch general con&s;ternation, and killing a con&s;iderable number of men, retired at la&s;t in good order.</P>
<P><PB N="372" REF="011837_0774_0F9D8A4A01169850">BUT all feeling or remembrance of this lo&s;s and danger were quickly obliterated by a more dreadful as well as affecting &s;pectacle. It was now broad day; the hurricane had abated nothing of its violence, and the &s;ea appeared agitated with all the rage of which that de&s;tructive element is capable; all the &s;hips, on which alone the whole army knew that their &s;afety and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence depended, were &s;een driven from their anchors, &s;ome da&s;hing again&s;t each other, &s;ome beat to pieces on the rocks, many forced a&s;hore, and not a few &s;inking in the waves. In le&s;s than an hour, fifteen &s;hips of war, and an hundred and forty tran&s;|ports with eight thou&s;and men peri&s;hed; and &s;uch of the unhappy crews as e&s;caped the fury of the &s;ea, were murdered, without mercy, by the Arabs, as &s;oon as they reached land. The Emperor &s;tood in &s;i|lent angui&s;h and a&s;toni&s;hment beholding this fatal event, which at once bla&s;ted all his hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, and buried in the depths the va&s;t &s;tores which he had provided as well for annoying the enemy, as for &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting his own troops. He had it not in his power to afford them any other a&s;&s;i&s;tance or relief, than by &s;ending &s;ome troops to drive away the Arabs, and thus delivering a few who were &s;o fortunate as to get a&s;hore from the cruci fate which their companions had met with. At la&s;t the wind began to fall, and to give &s;ome hopes that as many &s;hips might e&s;cape, as to &s;ave the army from peri&s;hing by famine, and tran&s;|port them back to Europe. But the&s;e were only hopes; the approach of evening covered the &s;ea with darkne&s;s; and it being impo&s;&s;ible for the officers on board the &s;hips, that had out-lived the &s;torm, to &s;end any intelligence to their companions who were a&s;hore, they remained during the night, in all the angui&s;h of &s;u&s;pen&s;e and uncertainty. Next day, a boat di&s;|patched by Doria, made &s;hift to reach land, with in|formation, that having weathered out the &s;torm, to which, during fifty years knowledge of the &s;ea, he had never &s;een any equal in fiercene&s;s and horror; he had found it nece&s;&s;ary to bear away with his &s;hattered &s;hips to Cape Metafuz. He advi&s;ed the Emperor, as the face of the &s;ky was &s;till lowering and tempe&s;tuous,
<PB N="373" REF="011837_0775_0F9D8A4B42739810">
to march with all &s;peed to that place, where the troops could reimbark with greater ea&s;e.</P>
<P>WHATEVER comfort this intelligence afforded Charles, from being a&s;&s;ured that part of his fleet had e&s;caped, was balanced by the new cares and perplexity in which it involved him with regard to his army. Me|tafuz was at lea&s;t three days march from his pre&s;ent camp; all the provi&s;ions which he had brought a&s;hore at his fir&s;t landing were now con&s;umed; his &s;oldiers worn out with fatigue, were &s;carce able for &s;uch a journey, even in a friendly country; and being di&s;|pirited by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of hard&s;hips, which victory it|&s;elf would &s;carce have rendered tolerable, they were in no condition to undergo new toils. But the &s;itua|tion of the army was &s;uch, as allowed not one mo|ment for deliberation, nor left it in the lea&s;t doubt|ful what to chu&s;e. They were ordered in&s;tantly to march, the wounded, the &s;ick and the feeble being placed in the centre; &s;uch as &s;eemed mo&s;t vigorous were &s;tationed in the front and rear. Then the &s;ad effects of what they had &s;uffered began to appear more manife&s;tly than ever, and new calamities were added to all the&s;e which they had already endured. Some could &s;carce bear the weight of their arms; others, &s;pent with the toil of forcing their way through deep and almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able roads, &s;unk down and died; many peri&s;hed by famine, as the whole army &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ed chiefly on roots and berries, or the fle&s;h of hor&s;es, killed by the Emperor's order, and di&s;tributed among the &s;everal battalions; many were drowned in brooks which were &s;woln &s;o much by the exce&s;&s;ive rains, that in pa&s;&s;ing them they waded up to the chin; not a few were killed by the enemy, who during the greate&s;t part of their retreat, alarmed, harra&s;&s;ed and annoyed them night and day. At la&s;t they arrived at Metafuz; and the weather being now &s;o calm as to re&s;tore their communication with the fleet, they were &s;upplied with plenty of provi&s;ions, and cheered with the pro&s;pect of &s;afety.</P>
<P>DURING this dreadful &s;eries of calamities, the Em|peror di&s;covered great qualities, many of which an almo&s;t uninterrupted flow of pro&s;perity had hitherto

afforded him no opportunity of di&s;playing. He was con&s;picuous for firmne&s;s and con&s;tancy of &s;pirit, for magnanimity, fortitude, humanity and compa&s;&s;ion. He endured as great hard&s;hips as the meane&s;t &s;oldier; he expo&s;ed his own per&s;on wherever danger appeared; he encouraged the de&s;ponding; vi&s;ited the &s;ick and wounded; and animated all by his words and exam|ple. When the army embarked, he was among the la&s;t who left the &s;hore, although a body of Arabs ho|vered at no great di&s;tance, ready to fall on the rear. By the&s;e virtues, Charles attoned, in &s;ome degree, for his ob&s;tinancy and pre&s;umption in undertaking an expedition &s;o fatal to his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>THE calamities which attended this unfortunate enterprize did not end here; for no &s;ooner were the forces got on board, than a new &s;torm ari&s;ing, though le&s;s furious than the former, &s;cattered the fleet, and obliged them, &s;eparately, to make towards &s;uch ports in Spain or Italy as they could fir&s;t reach; thus &s;pread|ing the account of their di&s;a&s;ters, with all the cir|cum&s;tances of aggravation and horror, which their fear or fancy &s;ugge&s;ted. The Emperor him&s;elf, after e&s;caping great dangers, and being forced into the port of Bugia in Africa, where he was obliged, by contrary winds, to remain &s;everal weeks, arrived at la&s;t in Spain, (December 2.) in a condition very different from that in which he had returned from his former expedition again&s;t the In&s;idels <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Carol. v.

<P>IMPRESSED with the deepe&s;t &s;en&s;ations of gratitude, the Editor takes this opportunity of &s;incerely thanking the numerous Sub&s;cribers to the American edition of Ro|bert&s;on's Hi&s;tory of Charles the Fifth, in periodical Vo|lumes.&mdash;Vivified by the encouragement afforded him in your acceptance of each Volume &s;ewed in blue boards, as an equivalent for One Dollar;&mdash;And animated by this practical proof of your alacrity to promote native fabrica|tions, he re&s;pectfully layeth before the American Public, Propo&s;als for reprinting in periodical Volumes by &s;ub&s;crip|tion.&mdash;Thus humbly to attempt, in the New World, the reprinting of &s;uch celebrated Books at moderate Prices, cal|culated for this Meridian, as Men of Literary Ta&s;te, and Lovers of Country-born Manufactures, are plea&s;ed to contri|bute their names to encourage the republication of in America. &mdash;Becau&s;e &s;ome inimical incendiaries, who daily fo&s;ter the exiguity of their under&s;tandings, by barricading their fa|culties in the vile and almo&s;t impregnable ca&s;tle of igno|rance, exotics to the native rights of American Freedom, have in&s;inuated, that this Edition is an infraction on the monopoly of literary property in Great-Britain, the Editor reque&s;ts their attention to this &s;ubject <HI>for a few moments.</HI></P>
<P>IN the year 1709, the Legi&s;lature of Great-Britain, le|gally a&s;certained to every author the &s;ale of his works for fourteen years certain.&mdash;However rea&s;onable this mono|poly of literature might appear in a country over-grown with riches, thank God and government, this monopoly ex|tendeth no farther than Great-Britain.&mdash;As precedents

<P>IRELAND is a dependent and &s;ubordinate kingdom, be|longing to Great-Britain: It was not till the year 1730, that a ta&s;te for literary knowledge made any con&s;iderable progre&s;s there; but, ever &s;ince the year 1740, this ta&s;te hath made &s;uch rapid and univer&s;al progre&s;s, among the higher rank of people in Ireland, that, as &s;oon as any new Book appears in London, it is immediately reprinted by the Iri&s;h Book&s;ellers in Dublin.</P>
<P>THUS the depre&s;&s;ed, I had almo&s;t &s;aid, the opp&mdash;&s;&s;&mdash;d people of Ireland, hath reprinted two editions of Robert|&s;on's Charles V. three editions of Black&s;tone's Commen|taries, two editions of the Univer&s;al Hi&s;tory, one edition of Chambers's Dictionary, and editions of every valuable Work produced in Great-Britain, without rendering the &s;malle&s;t pecuniary regard either to Authors or to Book&s;ellers. &mdash;The rea&s;on is obvious; becau&s;e the monopoly doth not reach beyond the limits of Great-Britain, and cannot extend into any country governed by an A&s;&s;embly of Repre|&s;entatives, until they become &s;o corrupted, as to barter away the birth-rights of the people, which they were elected to pre&s;erve, and to increa&s;e rather than to dimini&s;h.&mdash;Dr. Robert&s;on did receive for his manu&s;cript copy of Charles V. the &s;um of Four Thou&s;and Guineas; and the Briti&s;h Book|&s;ellers, who gave this money, were purcha&s;ers with full no|tice, for they ab&s;olutely and po&s;itively knew, that, if they were to give him or any other author Four Hundred Thou|&s;and Guineas, they could not purcha&s;e the monopoly of that work in the kingdom of Ireland, nor in the provinces on the va&s;t Continent of North-America.&mdash;The Repre|&s;entatives of the people in Ireland will never give up this high-born privilege of freely di&s;&s;eminating knowledge, be|cau&s;e the nation, when compared with the former inhabi|tants have been by this means, not only Humanified, but al|mo&s;t Angelified:

<P>AS to Ireland, that is &s;till a di&s;tinct kingdom; though a dependent, &s;ubordinate kingdom. It was only in|titled the dominion or lord&s;hip of Ireland, and the king's &s;tile was no other than <HI>dominus Hiberniae,</HI> lord of Ireland, till the thirty-third year of king Henry the eighth; when he a&s;&s;umed the title of King, which is recognized by act of parliament, 35 Hen. VIII. c. 3. But, as Scotland and Eng|land are now one and the &s;ame kingdom, and yet differ in their municipal laws; &s;o England and Ireland are, on the other hand, di&s;tinct kingdoms, and yet in general agree in their laws. The inhabitants of Ireland are, for the mo&s;t part, de&s;cended from the Engli&s;h, who planted it as a kind of colony, after the conque&s;t of it by King Henry the &s;econd; and the laws of England were then received and &s;worn to by the Iri&s;h nation, a&s;&s;embled at the council of Li&s;more. And as Ireland, thus conquered, planted, and governed, &s;till con|tinues in a &s;tate of dependence, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily conform
<PB REF="011837_0801_0F9D898DF0AC7EB8">
to, and be obliged by, &s;uch laws as the &s;uperior &s;tate thinks proper to pre&s;cribe.</P>

<P>THE i&s;lands of Jer&s;ey, Guern&s;ey, Sark, Alderney, and their appendages, were parcel of the duchy of Normandy, and were united to the crown of England by the fir&s;t princes of the Norman line.</P>
<P>* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *</P>
<P>BESIDES the&s;e adjacent i&s;lands, our more di&s;tant planta|tions in America, and el&s;ewhere, are al&s;o in &s;ome re&s;pects &s;ubject to the Engli&s;h laws. Plantations or colonies in di&s;|tant countries, are either &s;uch where the lands are claimed by right of occupancy only, by finding them de&s;art and un|cultivated, and peopling them from the mother country; or where, when already cultivated, they have been either gained by conque&s;t, or ceded to us by treaties. And both the&s;e rights are founded upon the law of nature, or at lea&s;t upon that of nations. But there is a difference between the&s;e two &s;pecies of colonies, with re&s;pect to the laws by which they are bound. For it hath been held, that if an uninhabited country be di&s;covered and planted by Engli&s;h &s;ubjects, all the Engli&s;h laws then in being, which are the birthright of every &s;ubject, are immediately there in force. BUT THIS MUST BE UNDERSTOOD WITH VER<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> MANY AND VERY GREAT RESTRICTIONS. Such coloni&s;ts carry with them only &s;o much of the Eng|li&s;h law, as is applicable to their own &s;ituation and the con|dition of an infant colony; &s;uch, for in&s;tance, as the general rules of inheritance, and of protection from per&s;onal inju|ries. The artificial refinements and di&s;tinctions incident to the property of a great and commercial people, the laws of police and revenue, (&s;uch e&s;pecially as are inforced by penal|ties) the mode of maintenance for the e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy, the juri&s;diction of &s;piritual courts, and a multitude of other pro|vi&s;ions, ARE NEITHER NECESSARY NOR CON|VENIENT FOR THEM, AND THEREFORE ARE NOT IN FORCE. What &s;hall be admitted and what
<PB REF="011837_0802_0F9D898EB1735510">
rejected, at what times, and under what re&s;trictions, mu&s;t, in ca&s;e of di&s;pute, be decided in the fir&s;t in&s;tance by their own provincial judicature, &s;ubject to the rever&s;ion and control of the king in council, the whole of their con&s;titution being al&s;o liable to be new-modelled and reformed, by the general &s;uper|intending power of the legi&s;lature in the mother country. But in conquered or ceded countries, that have already laws of their own, the king may indeed alter and change tho&s;e laws; but, till he does actually change them, the ancient laws of the country remain, unle&s;s &s;uch as are again&s;t the law of God, as in the ca&s;e of an infidel country. Our American plantations are principally of this latter &s;ort, being obtained in the la&s;t century either by right of conque&s;t and driving out the natives (with what natural ju&s;tice I &s;hall not at pre&s;ent enquire) or by treaties. And therefore the com|mon law of England, as &s;uch, has no allowance or autho|rity there; they being no part of the mother country, but di&s;tinct (though dependent) dominions. They are &s;ubject however to the control of the parliament; though (like Ire|land, Man, and the re&s;t) not bound by any acts of parlia|ment, unle&s;s particularly named.</P>

<P>THESE are the &s;everal parts of the dominions of the crown of Great-Britain, in which the municipal laws of England are not of force or authority, merely <HI>as</HI> the municipal laws of England. Mo&s;t of them have probably copied the &s;pirit of their own law from this original; but then it receives its obligation, and authoritative force, from being the law of the country.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="editor's note">
<P>SURELY, the precedent of the people of Ireland's re|printing every work produced in London, and the great Lawyer Black&s;tone's authority concerning the internal legi&s;|lation of colonies, are demon&s;trations of the rectitude of reprinting any, or every work of excellence in America, without the &s;malle&s;t infringement of the Briti&s;h embargo upon literature.&mdash;Is it not enough that their embargo pre|vents Americans from &s;hipping their manufactures of this
<PB REF="011837_0803_0F9D898F744B96A8">
kind into Britain.&mdash;Would it not be incompatible with all freedom, if an American's mind mu&s;t be entirely &s;tarved and en&s;laved in the barren regions of fruitle&s;s vacuity, becau&s;e he doth not wallow in immen&s;e riches equal to &s;ome Briti&s;h Lords, the origin of who&s;e progenitors are lo&s;t in the chaos of antiquity?</P>
<P>THE Editor hopeth, that the facts above exhibited are &s;uf|ficient &s;upport for Americans, to per&s;evere in reprinting what&s;oever books merit their approbation, without leave or licence from the Bibliopoli&s;ts or Monopoli&s;ts of Great-Britain; he is therefore determined, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to practi&s;e the advice contained in George Fi&s;her's emphatic lines.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE REIGN OF THE EMPEROR CHARLES V. BOOK VII.</HEAD>
<P>THE calamities which the Emperor &s;uffered in his unfortunate enterprize again&s;t Al|giers were great; and the account of the&s;e, which augmented in proportion as it &s;pread at a greater di&s;tance from the &s;cene of his di&s;a&s;ters, en|couraged Francis to begin ho&s;tilities, on which he had been for &s;ome time re&s;olved. But he did not think it prudent, to produce as the motives of this re&s;olution, either his antient preten&s;ions to the dutchy of Milan, or the Emperor's di&s;ingenuity in violating his repeated pro|mi&s;es with regard to the re&s;titution of that country. The former might have been a good rea&s;on again&s;t con|cluding the truce of Nice, but was none for breaking it; the latter could not be urged without expo&s;ing his own credulity as much as the Emperor's want of integrity. A violent and unwarrantable action of one of the Impe|rial generals furni&s;hed him with a rea&s;on to ju&s;tify his taking arms, which was of greater weight than either of the&s;e, and &s;uch as would have rouzed him, if he had been as de&s;irous of peace, as he was eager for war. Francis, by &s;igning the treaty of truce at Nice, without con&s;ulting Solyman, gave (as he fore&s;aw) great offence to that haughty Monarch, who con&s;idered an alliance
<PB N="2" REF="011837_0821_0F9D899D77766CE0">
with him as an honour of which a Chri&s;tian Prince had cau&s;e to be proud. The French King's friendly inter|view with the Emperor in Provence, followed by &s;uch extraordinary appearances of union and confidence as accompanied Charles's reception in France, induced the Sultan to &s;u&s;pect that the two rivals had at la&s;t forgotten their antient enmity, in order that they might form &s;uch a general confederacy again&s;t the Ottoman power, as had been long wi&s;hed for in Chri&s;tendom and often at|tempted in vain. Charles, with his u&s;ual art, endea|voured to confirm and &s;trengthen the&s;e &s;u&s;picions, by in&s;tructing his emi&s;&s;aries at Con&s;tantinople, as well as in tho&s;e courts with which Solyman held any intelligence, to repre&s;ent the concord between him and Francis to be &s;o entire, that their &s;entiments, views and pur&s;uits, would be the &s;ame for the future <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Ribier. tom. i. p. 502.</NOTE>. It was not without diffi|culty that Francis effaced the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions; but the addre&s;s of Rincon, the French amba&s;&s;ador at the Porte, together with the manife&s;t advantage of carrying on ho|&s;tilities again&s;t the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria in concert with France, prevailed at length on the Sultan to enter into a clo&s;er conjunction with Francis than ever. Rincon re|turned into France, in order to communicate to his ma&s;ter a &s;cheme of the Sultan's for gaining the concur|rence of the Venetians in their operations again&s;t the common enemy. Solyman having lately concluded a peace with that republic, to which the mediation of Francis, and the good offices of Rincon had greatly con|tributed, thought it not impo&s;&s;ible to allure the &s;enate by &s;uch advantages, as, together with the example of the French Monarch, might over-balance any &s;cruples ari&s;ing either from decency or caution that could operate on the other &s;ide. Francis, warmly approving of this mea&s;ure, di&s;patched Rincon back to Con&s;tantinople, and directing him to go by Venice along with Fergo&s;o, a Genoe&s;e exile, whom he appointed his amba&s;&s;ador to that republic, empowered them to negociate the matter with the &s;enate, to whom Solyman had &s;ent an envoy for the &s;ame purpo&s;e <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. de Venet. de Purata, iv. 125.</NOTE>. The Marquis del Gua&s;to, go|vernor

of the Milane&s;e, an officer of great abilities, but capable of attempting and executing the mo&s;t atrocious actions, got intelligence of the motions and de&s;tination of the&s;e amba&s;&s;adors. As he knew how much his ma&s;|ter wi&s;hed to di&s;cover the intentions of the French King, and of what con&s;equence it was to retard the execution of his mea&s;ures, he employed &s;ome &s;oldiers belonging to the garri&s;on of Pavia to lie in wait for Rincon and Fergo&s;o as they &s;ailed down the Po, who murdered them and mo&s;t of their attendants, and &s;eized their papers. Upon receiving an account of this barbarous outrage, committed, during the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of truce, again&s;t per|&s;ons held &s;acred by the mo&s;t uncivilized nations, Fran|cis's grief for the unhappy fate of two &s;ervants whom he loved and tru&s;ted, his unea&s;ine&s;s at the interruption of his &s;chemes by their death, and every other pa&s;&s;ion were &s;wallowed up and lo&s;t in the indignation which this in&s;ult on the honour of his crown excited. He exclaimed loudly again&s;t Gua&s;to, who, having drawn upon him&s;elf all the infamy of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination without making any di&s;covery of importance, as the amba&s;&s;adors had left their in&s;tructions and other papers of con&s;equence behind them, now boldly denied his being acce&s;&s;ary in any wi&s;e to the crime. He &s;ent an amba&s;&s;ador to the Emperor to demand &s;uitable reparation for an indignity, which no Prince, how incon&s;iderable &s;oever, or pu&s;illanimous, could tamely endure: And when Charles, impatient at that time to &s;et out on his African expedition, endeavoured to put him off with an eva&s;ive an&s;wer, he appealed to all the courts in Europe, &s;etting forth the heinou&s;ne&s;s of the in|jury, the &s;pirit of moderation with which he had applied for redre&s;s, and the iniquity of the Emperor in di&s;re|garding this ju&s;t reque&s;t.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the confidence with which Gua&s;to a&s;&s;erted his own innocence, the accu&s;ations of the French gained greater credit than all his prote&s;ta|tions; and Bellay, the French commander in Piedmont, procured, at length, by his indu&s;try and addre&s;s, &s;uch a minute detail of the tran&s;actions, with the te&s;timony of &s;o many of the parties concerned, as amounted almo&s;t to a legal proof of the Marquis's guilt. In con&s;equence of this opinion of the public, confirmed by &s;uch &s;trong
<PB N="4" REF="011837_0823_0F9D899E6F24F458">
evidence, Francis's complaints were univer&s;ally allowed to be well founded, and the &s;teps he took towards re|newing ho&s;tilities were a&s;cribed not merely to ambition or re&s;entment, but to the unavoidable nece&s;&s;ity of vin|dicating the honour of his crown <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Bellay, 367, &amp;c. Jovii Hi&s;t. lib. 40. 268.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT how ju&s;t &s;oever Francis might e&s;teem his own cau&s;e, he did not tru&s;t &s;o much to that, as to neglect the proper precautions for gaining other allies be&s;ides the Sultan, by who&s;e aid he might counterbalance the Em|peror's &s;uperior power. But his negociations to this ef|fect were attended with very little &s;ucce&s;s. Henry VIII. more and more bent upon &s;chemes again&s;t Scotland, which he knew would at once di&s;&s;olve his union with France, was inclinable rather to take part with the Em|peror than to contribute in any degree towards favour|ing the operations again&s;t him. The Pope adhered in|violably to his antient &s;y&s;tem of neutrality. The Vene|tians, notwith&s;tanding Solyman's &s;olicitations, imitated the Pope's example. The Germans, &s;atisfied with the religious liberty which they enjoyed, found it more their intere&s;t to gratify than to irritate the Emperor; &s;o that the Kings of Denmark and Sweden, who on this occa|&s;ion were fir&s;t drawn in to intere&s;t them&s;elves in the quarrels of the more potent Monarchs of the &s;outh, and the Duke of Cleves, who had a di&s;pute with the Empe|ror about the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Gueldres, were the only con|federates Francis &s;ecured. But the dominions of the two former lay at &s;uch a di&s;tance, and the power of the latter was &s;o incon&s;iderable, that he gained little by their alliance.</P>
<P>FRANCIS, however, &s;upplied all defects by his own activity. Being afflicted at this time with a di&s;temper, the effect of his irregular plea&s;ures, and which prevented his pur&s;uing them with the &s;ame licentious indulgence, he applied to bu&s;ine&s;s with more than his u&s;ual indu&s;try. The &s;ame cau&s;e which occa&s;ioned this extraordinary at|tention to his affairs, rendered him moro&s;e and di&s;&s;ati&s;|fied with the mini&s;ters whom he had hitherto employed. This accidental peevi&s;hne&s;s of temper being &s;harpened by reflecting on the fal&s;e &s;teps into which he had lately
<PB N="5" REF="011837_0824_0F9D899F2E0BE720">
been betrayed, and the in&s;ults to which he had been ex|po&s;ed, &s;ome of tho&s;e in whom he had hitherto placed the greate&s;t confidence, felt the effects of this change in his temper, and were deprived of their offices. At la&s;t he di&s;graced Montmorency him&s;elf, who had long directed affairs, as well civil as military, with all the au|thority of a mini&s;ter no le&s;s beloved than tru&s;ted by his ma&s;ter; and Francis being fond of &s;hewing that the fall of &s;uch a powerful favourite did not affect the vigour or prudence of his admini&s;tration, this was a new motive to redouble his diligence in preparing to open the war by &s;ome &s;plendid and extraordinary effort.</P>
<P>FRANCIS accordingly brought into the field five ar|mies. One to act in Luxembourg under the Duke of Orleans, accompanied by the Duke of Lorraine as his in&s;tructor in the art of war. Another commanded by the Dauphin marched towards the frontiers of Spain. A third led by Van Ro&s;&s;em the mar&s;hal of Guelders, and compo&s;ed chiefly of the troops of Cleves, had Brabant allotted for the theatre of its operations. A fourth, of which the Duke of Vendome was general, hovered on the borders of Flanders. The la&s;t, con&s;i&s;ting of the forces cantoned in Piedmont, was de&s;tined for the Ad|miral Annibaut. The Dauphin and his brother were appointed to command where the chief exertion was in|tended, and the greate&s;t honour to be reaped; the ar|my of the former amounted to forty thou&s;and, that of the latter to thirty thou&s;and men. Nothing appears more &s;urprizing than that Francis did not pour the&s;e numerous and irre&s;i&s;tible armies into the Milane&s;e, which had &s;o long been the object of his wi&s;hes as well as en|terprizes, and that he &s;hould choo&s;e rather to turn al|mo&s;t his whole &s;trength into another direction, and to|wards new conque&s;ts. But the remembrance of the di&s;a&s;ters which he had met with in his former expedi|tions into Italy, together with the difficulty of &s;upport|ing a war carried on at &s;uch a di&s;tance from his own do|minions, had gradually abated his violent inclination to obtain footing in that country, and made him willing to try the fortune of his arms in another quarter. At the &s;ame time, he expected to make &s;uch a powerful imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;|&s;ion on the frontier of Spain, where there were few towns

of any &s;trength, and no army a&s;&s;embled to oppo&s;e him, as might enable him to recover po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the county of Rou&s;illon, lately di&s;membered from the French crown, before Charles could bring into the field any force able to ob&s;truct his progre&s;s. The nece&s;&s;ity of &s;upporting his ally the Duke of Cleves, and the hope of drawing a con&s;iderable body of &s;oldiers out of Germany by his means, determined him to act with vigour in the Low-Countries.</P>
<P>THE Dauphin and Duke of Orleans opened the campaign much about the &s;ame time, the former laying &s;iege to Perpignan the capital of Rou&s;illon, and the lat|ter entering Luxembourg. The Duke of Orleans pu&s;h|ed his operations with the greate&s;t rapidity and &s;ucce&s;s, one town falling after another, until no place in that large dutchy remained in the Emperor's hands but Thi|onville. Nor could he have failed of over-running the adjacent provinces with the &s;ame ea&s;e, if he had not vo|luntarily &s;topt &s;hort in his career of victory. But a re|port prevailing that the Emperor had determined to hazard a battle in order to &s;ave Perpignan, on a &s;udden the Duke, prompted by youthful ardour, or moved, perhaps, by jealou&s;y of his brother, whom he both en|vied and hated, abandoned his own conque&s;ts, and ha&s;tened towards Rou&s;illon in order to divide with him the glory of the victory.</P>
<P>ON his departure, &s;ome of his troops were di&s;banded, others de&s;erted their colours, and the re&s;t, cantoned in the towns which he had taken, remained inactive. By this conduct, which leaves a di&s;honourable imputation either on his under&s;tanding or his heart, or on both, he not only renounced whatever he could have hoped from &s;uch a promi&s;ing opening of the campaign, but gave the enemy an opportunity of recovering, before the end of &s;ummer all the conque&s;ts which he had gained. On the Spani&s;h frontier, the Emperor was not &s;o incon&s;iderate as to venture on a battle, the lo&s;s of which might have endan|gered his kingdom. Perpignan, though poorly forti|fied, and bri&s;kly attacked, having been largely &s;upplied with ammunition and provi&s;ions by the vigilance of Doria <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Sigonii Vita A.

Duke of Alva, the per&s;evering ob&s;tinacy of who&s;e tem|per fitted him admirably for &s;uch &s;ervice, that at la&s;t the French, after a &s;iege of three months, wa&s;ted by di&s;|ea&s;es, repul&s;ed in &s;everal a&s;&s;aults, and de&s;pairing of &s;uc|ce&s;s, relinqui&s;hed the undertaking, and retired into their own country <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Sandov.

Thus all Francis's mighty prepara|tions, either from &s;ome defect in his own conduct, or from the &s;uperior power and prudence of his rival, pro|duced no effects that bore any proportion to his expence and efforts, or &s;uch as gratified, in any degree, his own hopes, or an&s;wered the expectation of Europe. The only &s;olid advantage of the campaign was the acqui&s;i|tion of a few towns in Piedmont, which Bellay gamed rather by &s;tratagem and addre&s;s, than by the force of his arms <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Sandov.

<P>MEANWHILE the Emperor and Francis, though both con&s;iderably exhau&s;ted by &s;uch great but indeci&s;ive ef|forts, di&s;covering no abatement of their mutual animo|&s;ity, employed all their attention, tried every expedient, and turned them&s;elves towards every quarter, in order to acquire new allies, together with &s;uch a reinforcement of &s;trength, as would give them the &s;uperiority in the en&s;uing campaign. Charles, taking advantage of the terror and re&s;entment of the Spaniards, upon the &s;ud|den inva&s;ion of their country prevailed on the Cortes of the &s;everal kingdoms to grant him &s;ub&s;idies with a more liberal hand than u&s;ual. At the &s;ame time, he borrowed a large &s;um from John King of Portugal, putting him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by way of &s;ecurity for his being repaid, of the Molucca i&s;les in the Ea&s;t Indies, with the gainful commerce of precious &s;pices, which that &s;eque&s;tered corner of the globe yields. Not &s;atisfied with this, he negociated a marriage between Philip his only &s;on, now in his &s;ixteenth year, and Mary daughter of that Mo|narch, with whom her father, the mo&s;t opulent Prince in Europe, gave a large dower; and having likewi&s;e per|&s;uaded the Cortes of Aragon and Valencia to recognize Philip as the heir of the&s;e crowns, he obtained from them the donative u&s;ual on &s;uch occa&s;ions <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ferreras, 9. 238. 241.

extraordinary &s;upplies enabled him to make &s;uch addi|tions to his forces in Spain, that he could detach a great body into the Low-Countries, and yet re&s;erve as many as were &s;ufficient for the defence of the kingdom. Hav|ing thus provided for the &s;ecurity of Spain and com|mitted the government of it to his &s;on, he &s;ailed for Italy, in his way to Germany. But how attentive &s;oever to rai&s;e the funds for carrying on the war, or eager to gra&s;p at any new expedient for that purpo&s;e, he was not &s;o in|con&s;iderate as to accept of the overture which Paul, knowing his nece&s;&s;ities, artfully threw out to him. That ambitious Pontiff, no le&s;s &s;agacious to di&s;cern, than watchful to &s;eize opportunities of aggrandizing his fa|mily, &s;olicited him to grant Octavio his grandchild, whom the Emperor had admitted to the honour of being his &s;on-in-law, the inve&s;titure of the dutchy of Milan, in return for which he promi&s;ed &s;uch a va&s;t &s;um of mo|ney, as would have gone far towards &s;upplying his pre|&s;ent exigencies. But Charles, as well from unwilling|ne&s;s to alienate a province of &s;o much value, as from di&s;|gu&s;t at the Pope, who had hitherto refu&s;ed to join in the war again&s;t Francis, rejected the propo&s;al. His di&s;&s;a|tisfaction with Paul at that juncture was &s;o great, that he even refu&s;ed to approve his alienating Parma and Placentia from the patrimony of St. Peter, and &s;ettling them on his own &s;on and grand&s;on as a fief to be held of the holy &s;ee. As no other expedient for rai&s;ing money among the Italian &s;tates remained, he con&s;ented to with|draw the garri&s;ons which he had hitherto kept in the ci|tadels of Florence and Leghorn, in con&s;ideration for which, he received a large pre&s;ent from Co&s;mo de Me|dici, who by this means &s;ecured his own independance and got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of two forts, which were ju&s;tly called the fetters of Tu&s;cany <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Adriani I&s;toria i. 195.

<P>BUT Charles, while he &s;eemed to have turned his whole attention towards rai&s;ing the &s;ums nece&s;&s;ary for defraying the expences of the year, had not been negli|gent of objects more di&s;tant, though no le&s;s important, and had concluded a league offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive
<PB N="9" REF="011837_0828_0F9D89A23286B910">
with Henry VIII. from which he derived in the end, greater advantage than from all his other preparations. Several &s;light circum&s;tances, which have already been mentioned, had begun to alienate the affections of that Monarch from Francis, his pre&s;ent ally, and new inci|dents of greater moment had occurred to increa&s;e his di&s;gu&s;t and animo&s;ity. Henry, de&s;irous of e&s;tabli&s;hing an uniformity in religion in Great-Britain, as well as fond of making pro&s;elytes to his own opinions, had formed a &s;cheme of per&s;uading his nephew the King of Scotland to renounce the Pope's &s;upremacy, and to adopt the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem of reformation which he had in|troduced into England. This mea&s;ure he pur&s;ued with his u&s;ual eagerne&s;s and impetuo&s;ity, making &s;uch ad|vantageous overtures to James, whom he con&s;idered as not over &s;crupulou&s;ly attached to any religious tenets, that he &s;carce doubted of &s;ucce&s;s. His propo&s;itions were accordingly received in &s;uch a manner that he flat|tered him&s;elf with having gained his point. But the Scotti&s;h eccle&s;ia&s;tics, fore&s;eeing the ruin of the church to be the con&s;equence of the King's union with Eng|land; and the partizans of France, no le&s;s convinced that it would put an end to the influence of that crown upon the public councils of Scotland, combined toge|ther, and by their in&s;inuations defeated Henry's &s;cheme at the very moment when he expected it to have taken effect. Too haughty to brook &s;uch a di&s;appointment, which he imputed as much to the arts of the French, as to the levity of the Scotti&s;h Monarch, he took arms again&s;t Scotland, threatening to &s;ubdue the kingdom, &s;ince he could not gain the friend&s;hip of its King. At the &s;ame time, his re&s;entment at Francis quickened his negociations with the Emperor, an alliance with whom he was now as forward to accept, as the other could be to offer it. During this war with Scotland, and before the conclu&s;ion of his negociations with Charles, James V. died, leaving his crown to Mary, his only daughter, an infant a few days old. Upon this event, Henry al|tered at once his whole &s;y&s;tem with regard to Scotland, and abandoning all thoughts of conquering it, aimed at what was more advantageous as well as practicable, an union with that kingdom by a marriage between Edward

his only &s;on and the young Queen. But, here too, he apprehended a vigorous oppo&s;ition from the French faction in Scotland, which began to be&s;tir it&s;elf in order to thwart the mea&s;ure. The nece&s;&s;ity of cru&s;hing this party among the Scots, and of preventing Francis from furni&s;hing them with any effectual aid, confirmed Hen|ry's re&s;olution of breaking with France, and pu&s;hed him on to put a fini&s;hing hand to the treaty of confe|deracy with the Emperor.</P>
<P>IN this league were contained fir&s;t of all, articles for &s;ecuring their future amity and mutual defence; then were enumerated the demands which they were re|&s;pectively to make upon Francis; and the plan of their proceedings was fixed, if he &s;hould refu&s;e to grant them &s;atisfaction. They agreed to require, that Francis &s;hould not only renounce his alliance with Solyman, which had been the &s;ource of infinite calamities to Chri&s;tendom, but al&s;o that he &s;hould make reparation for the damages which that unnatural union had occa&s;ioned; that he &s;hould re&s;tore Burgundy to the Emperor; that he &s;hould de&s;i&s;t immediately from ho&s;tilities, and leave Charles at lei&s;ure to oppo&s;e the common enemy of the Chri&s;tian faith; and that he &s;hould immediately pay the &s;ums due to Henry, or put &s;ome towns in his hands as &s;ecurity to that effect. If, within forty days, he did not comply with the&s;e demands, they then engaged to invade France each with twenty thou&s;and foot, and five thou&s;and hor&s;e, and not to lay down their arms until they had recovered Burgundy, together with the towns on the Somme for the Emperor, and Normandy and Guienne, or even the whole realm of France for Henry <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Rym. xiv. 768. Herb. 238.</NOTE>. Their heralds, accordingly, &s;et out with the&s;e haughty requi&s;itions; but not being permitted to enter France, could not per|form their commi&s;&s;ion, and the two Monarchs held them|&s;elves fully entitled to execute whatever was &s;tipulated in their treaty.</P>
<P>FRANCIS, on his part, was no le&s;s diligent in prepar|ing for the approaching campaign. Having early ob|&s;erved the &s;ymptoms of Henry's di&s;gu&s;t and alienation, and finding all his endeavours to &s;ooth and reconcile

him ineffectual, he knew his temper too well not to ex|pect that open ho&s;tilities would quickly follow upon this ce&s;&s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on of friend&s;hip. For this rea&s;on he redou|bled his endeavours to obtain from Solyman &s;uch aid as might counterbalance the great acce&s;&s;ion of &s;trength which the Emperor would receive by his alliance with England. In order to &s;upply the place of his two am|ba&s;&s;adors murdered by Gua&s;to, he &s;ent as his envoy fir&s;t to Venice, and then to Con&s;tantinople, Paulin, a captain of foot, a man of a daring and active &s;pirit, and on ac|count of the&s;e qualities thought worthy of this &s;ervice, to which he was recommended by Bellay, who had trained him to the arts of negociation, and made trial of his ta|lents and addre&s;s on &s;everal occa&s;ions. Nor did he be|lie the opinion conceived of his courage and abilities. Ha&s;tening to Con&s;tantinople, without regarding the dan|gers to which he was expo&s;ed, he urged his ma&s;ter's demands with &s;uch boldne&s;s, and availed him&s;elf of every circum&s;tance with &s;uch dexterity, that he remov|ed all the Sultan's own difficulties. He &s;ilenced like|wi&s;e &s;ome of the Ba&s;&s;as, who either &s;wayed by opinion, or having been gained by the Emperor, who&s;e emi&s;&s;a|ries had made their way even into that court, had declared in the Divan again&s;t acting in concert with France <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Sandov. Hi&s;tor. tom ii. 346. Jovii Hi&s;t. lib. 41. 285, &amp;c. 300, &amp;c. Brantome.</NOTE>. At la&s;t he obtained orders for Barbaro&s;&s;a to &s;ail with a powerful fleet, and to regulate all his opera|tions by the directions of the French King. Francis was not equally &s;ucce&s;sful in his attempts to gain the Princes of the empire. The extraordinary rigour with which he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to puni&s;h &s;uch of his &s;ub|jects as had embraced the Prote&s;tant opinions, in order to give &s;ome notable evidence of his own zeal for the Catholic faith, and to wipe off the imputation to which he was liable from his confederacy with the Turks, placed an in&s;uperable barrier between him and &s;uch of the Germans as intere&s;t and inclination would have prompted mo&s;t readi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y to join him <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Seck. lib. iii. 403.</NOTE>. His chief ad|vantage, however, over the Emperor he derived on this, as on other occa&s;ions, from the contiguity of his do|minions,
<PB N="12" REF="011837_0831_0F9D89A471862960">
as well as from the extent of the royal autho|rity in France, which exempted him from all the de|lays and di&s;appointments unavoidable wherever popu|lar a&s;&s;emblies provide for the expences of government by occa&s;ional and frugal &s;ub&s;idies. Hence his dome&s;|tic preparations were always carried on with vigour and rapidity, while tho&s;e of the Emperor, unle&s;s when quickened by &s;ome foreign &s;upply, or &s;ome temporary expedient, were to the la&s;t degree &s;low and dilatory.</P>
<P>LONG before any army was in readine&s;s to oppo&s;e him, Francis took the field in the Low-Countries, again&s;t which he turned the whole weight of the war. He made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Landrecy, which he de|termined to keep as the key to the whole province of Hainault; and ordered it to be fortified with great care. Turning from thence to the right, he entered the dutchy of Luxembourg, and found it in the &s;ame defencele&s;s &s;tate as in the former year. Meanwhile, the Emperor, having drawn together an army compo&s;ed of all the different nations &s;ubject to his government, en|tered the territories of the Duke of Cleves, on whom he had vowed to inflict exemplary vengeance. This Prince, who&s;e conduct and &s;ituation were &s;imilar to that of Robert de la Mark in the fir&s;t war between Charles and Francis, re&s;embled him likewi&s;e in his fate. Un|able with his feeble army, to face the Emperor, who advanced at the head of forty four thou&s;and men, he retired at his approach; and the Imperiali&s;ts being at liberty to act as they plea&s;ed, immediately inve&s;ted Du|ren. That town, though gallantly defended, was won by a&s;&s;ault, all the inhabitants put to the &s;word, and the place it&s;elf reduced to a&s;hes. This dreadful example of &s;everity &s;truck the people of the country with &s;uch general terror, that all the other towns, even &s;uch as were capable of re&s;i&s;tance, &s;ent their keys to the Em|peror; and before a body of French, detached to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, could come up, the Duke him&s;elf was obli|ged to make his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to Charles in the mo&s;t abject manner. Being admitted into the Imperial pre&s;ence, he kneeled, together with eight of his principal &s;ubjects, and implored mercy. The Emperor allowed him to remain in that ignominious po&s;ture, and eyeing him with
<PB N="13" REF="011837_0832_0F9D89A5312AE618">
an haughty and implacable look, without deigning to an&s;wer a &s;ingle word, remitted him to his mini&s;ters. The conditions, however, which they pre&s;cribed were not &s;o rigorous as he had rea&s;on to have expected after &s;uch a reception. He was obliged to renounce his al|liance with France and Denmark; to re&s;ign all his pre|ten&s;ions to the dutchy of Guelders; to enter into per|petual amity with the Emperor and King of the Ro|mans. In return for which all his hereditary dominions were re&s;tored, except two towns which the Emperor kept as pledges of his fidelity during the continuance of the war, and he was re-in&s;tated in his privileges as a Prince of the empire. Not long after, Charles, as a proof of the &s;incerity of his reconcilement, gave him in marriage one of the daughters of his brother Ferdi|nand <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Haraei. Annal. Brabant. t. 1. 628. Becueil des Traites, t. ii. 226.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HAVING thus cha&s;ti&s;ed the pre&s;umption of the Duke of Cleves, detached one of his allies from Francis, and added to his dominions in the Low-Countries a con&s;i|derable province which lay contiguous to them, Charles advanced towards Hainault, and laid &s;iege to Landrecy. There, as the fir&s;t fruits of his alliance with Henry, he was joined by &s;ix thou&s;and Engli&s;h, under Sir John Wal|lop. The garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of veteran troops, com|manded by de la Lande and De&s;&s;e, two officers of repu|tation, made a vigorous re&s;i&s;tance. Francis approached with all his forces to relieve the place; Charles covered the &s;iege; both were determined to hazard an engage|ment; and all Europe expected to &s;ee this conte&s;t, which had continued &s;o long, decided at la&s;t by a battle be|tween two great armies led by them in per&s;on. But the ground which &s;eparated their two camps was &s;uch, as put the di&s;advantage manife&s;tly on his &s;ide who &s;hould venture to attack, and neither of them cho&s;e to run that ri&s;que: Amid&s;t a variety of movements, in or|der to draw the enemy into this &s;nare, or to avoid it them&s;elves, Francis, with admirable conduct, and equal good fortune, threw fir&s;t a &s;upply of fre&s;h troops, and then a convoy of provi&s;ions into the town, &s;o that the

<P>MEANWHILE, Solyman fulfilled his engagements to the French King with great punctuality. He him&s;elf marched into Hungary with a numerous army, and as the Princes of the empire made no great effort to &s;ave a country which Charles, by employing his whole force again&s;t Francis, &s;eemed willing to &s;acrifice, there was no appearance of any body of troops to oppo&s;e his pro|gre&s;s. He be&s;ieged one after another, Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inque Eccle|&s;iae, Alba and Gran, the three mo&s;t con&s;iderable towns in the kingdom, of which Ferdinand kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.

About the &s;ame time, Barbaro&s;&s;a &s;ailed with a fleet of an hundred and ten gallies, and coa&s;ting along the &s;hore of Calabria, made a de&s;cent at Rheggio, which he plundered and burnt; and advancing from thence to the mouth of the Tiber, he &s;topt there to water. The citizens of Rome, ignorant of his de&s;tination, and filled with terror, began to fly with &s;uch general precipitation, that the city would have been left de&s;erted, if they had not re&s;umed cou|rage upon letters from Polin the French envoy, a&s;&s;uring them that no violence or injury would be offered by the Turks to any &s;tate in alliance with the King his ma&s;ter <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Jovii Hi&s;t. l. 43. 304, &amp;c.</NOTE>. From O&s;tia Barbaro&s;&s;a &s;ailed to Mar&s;eilles, and being joined by the French fleet with a body of land forces on board under the Count d'Enguien, a gallant young Prince of the hou&s;e of Bourbon, they directed their cour&s;e towards Nice, the &s;ole retreat of the unfortunate Duke of Savoy.

The town, however, was bravely defended again&s;t their combined force by Montfort, a Savoyard gentleman, who &s;tood a general a&s;&s;ault, and repul&s;ed the enemy with great

lo&s;s, before he retired into the ca&s;tle. That &s;ort, &s;ituated upon a rock, on which the artillery made no impre&s;&s;ion, and which could not be undermined, he held out &s;o long, that Doria had time to approach with his fleet, and the Marquis del Gua&s;to to march with a body of troops from Milan. Upon intelligence of this, the French and Turks rai&s;ed the &s;iege <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Guichenon hi&s;toire de Savoye, t. 1. p. 651.

<P>FROM the &s;mall progre&s;s of either party during this campaign, it was obvious to what a length the war might be drawn out between two Princes, who&s;e power was &s;o equally balanced, and who by their own talents or activity, could &s;o vary and multiply their re&s;ources. The trial they had now made of each other's &s;trength might have taught them the imprudence of per&s;i&s;ting in a war, wherein there was greater appearance of their di&s;tre&s;&s;ing their own dominions, than of conquering tho&s;e of their ad|ver&s;ary, and &s;hould have di&s;po&s;ed both to wi&s;h for peace. If Charles and Francis had been influenced by con&s;ide|rations of intere&s;t or prudence alone, this, without doubt, mu&s;t have been the manner in which they would have rea&s;oned, but the per&s;onal animo&s;ity, which ming|led it&s;elf in all their quarrels, had grown to be &s;o vio|lent and implacable, that for the plea&s;ure of gratify|ing it, they di&s;regarded every thing el&s;e; and were in|finitely more &s;olicitous how to hurt their enemy, than how to &s;ecure what would be of advantage to them|&s;elves. No &s;ooner then did the &s;ea&s;on force them to &s;u&s;pend ho&s;tilities, than without paying any attention to the Pope's repeated endeavours, or paternal exhorta|tions to re-e&s;tabli&s;h peace, they began to provide for the operations of the next year with new vigour, and an ac|tivity increa&s;ing with their hatred. Charles turned his chief attention towards gaining the Princes of the em|pire, and endeavouring to rouze the formidable but unweildy &s;trength of the Germanic body again&s;t Fran|cis. In order to under&s;tand the propriety of the &s;teps which he took for that purpo&s;e, it is nece&s;&s;ary to review

<P>MUCH about the time that a&s;&s;embly broke up, Mau|rice &s;ucceeded his father Henry in the government of that part of Saxony which belonged to the Albertine branch of the Saxon family. This young Prince, then only in his twentieth year, had, even at that early pe|riod, begun to di&s;cover the great talents which qualified him for acting &s;uch a di&s;tingui&s;hed part in the affairs of Germany. As &s;oon as he entered upon the admini&s;tra|tion, he &s;truck out into &s;uch a new and &s;ingular path, as &s;hewed that he aimed, from the beginning, at &s;omething great and uncommon. Though zealou&s;ly attached to the Prote&s;tant opinions both from education and prin|ciple, he refu&s;ed to accede to the league of Smalkalde, being determined, as he &s;aid, to maintain the purity of religion which was the original object of that confede|racy, but not to entangle him&s;elf in the political inte|re&s;ts or combinations to which it had given ri&s;e. At the &s;ame time, fore&s;eeing a rupture between Charles and the confederates of Smalkalde, and perceiving which of them was mo&s;t likely to prevail in the conte&s;t, in&s;tead of that jealou&s;y and di&s;tru&s;t which the other Prote&s;tants expre&s;&s;ed of all the Emperor's de&s;igns, he affected to place in him an unbounded confidence; and courted his favour with the utmo&s;t a&s;&s;iduity. When the other Prote&s;tants, in the year fifteen hundred and forty two, either declined a&s;&s;i&s;ting Ferdinand in Hungary, or af|forded him reluctant and feeble aid, Maurice marched thither in per&s;on, and rendered him&s;elf con&s;picuous by his zeal and courage. From the &s;ame motive, he had led to the Emperor's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, during the former cam|paign a body of his own troops; and the gracefulne&s;s of his per&s;on, his dexterity in all military exerci&s;es, together with his intrepidity which courted and delighted in dan|gers, did not di&s;tingui&s;h him more in the field, than his great abilities and in&s;inuating addre&s;s won upon the Emperor's confidence and favour <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 317.

This, which proved in the &s;equel &s;o fatal to the Elector, had almo&s;t occa&s;ioned an open rupture be|tween them; and &s;oon after Maurice's acce&s;&s;ion to the government, they both took arms with equal rage, upon account of a di&s;pute about the right of juri&s;diction over a paltry town &s;ituated on the Moldaw.

<P>MEANWHILE the Pope, though extremely irritated at the Emperor's conce&s;&s;ions to the Prote&s;tants in the Diet of Rati&s;bon, was &s;o warmly &s;olicited on all hands, by &s;uch as were mo&s;t devoutly attached to the &s;ee of Rome, no le&s;s than by tho&s;e who&s;e fidelity or de&s;igns he &s;u&s;pected, to &s;ummon a general council, that he found it impo&s;&s;ible to avoid any longer calling that a&s;&s;embly. The impatience for its meeting, and the expectations of great effects from its deci&s;ions &s;eemed to grow in pro|portion to the difficulty of obtaining it. He &s;till ad|hered, however, to his original re&s;olution of holding it in &s;ome town of Italy, where, by the number of eccle|&s;ia&s;tics, retainers to his court, and depending on his fa|vour, who could repair to it without difficulty or ex|pence, he might influence and even direct all its proceed|ings. This propo&s;ition, though often rejected by the Germans, he in&s;tructed his nuncio to the Diet held at Spires, in the year one thou&s;and five hundred and forty two, to renew once more; and if he found it gave no greater &s;atisfaction than formerly, he empowered him, as a la&s;t conce&s;&s;ion, to propo&s;e for the place of meeting, Trent, a city in the Tyrol, &s;ubject to the King of the Romans, and &s;ituated on the confines between Germany and Italy. The Catholic Princes in the Diet, after giv|ing it as their opinion that the council might have been held with greater advantage in Rati&s;bon, Cologne, or &s;ome of the great cities in the empire, approved of the place which the Pope had named. The Prote&s;tants
<PB N="18" REF="011837_0837_0F9D89A8F3FB30A0">
unanimou&s;ly expre&s;&s;ed their di&s;&s;atisfaction, declaring that they would pay no regard to a council held without the precincts of the empire, called by the Pope's authority, and in which he a&s;&s;umed the right of pre&s;iding <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 291. Seck. l. iii. 283.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Pope, without taking any notice of their ob|jections, publi&s;hed the bull of intimation, named three cardinals to pre&s;ide as his legates, and appointed them to repair to Trent before the fir&s;t of November, the day he had fixed for opening the council. But if Paul had de&s;ired the meeting of a council as &s;incerely as he pre|tended, he would not have pitched on &s;uch an improper time for calling it. In&s;tead of that general union and tranquillity, without which the deliberations of a council could neither be conducted with &s;ecurity, nor attended with authority, &s;uch a fierce war was ju&s;t kindled be|tween the Emperor and Francis, as rendered it impo&s;|&s;ible for the eccle&s;ia&s;tics from many parts of Europe to re&s;ort thither in &s;afety. The legates, accordingly, re|mained &s;everal months at Trent without any per&s;ons ap|pearing, except a few prelates from the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate; upon which the Pope, in order to avoid the ridi|cule and contempt which this drew upon him from the enemies of the church, recalled them and prorogued the council <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">F.

<P>UNHAPPILY for the authority of the papal &s;ee, at the very time that the German Prote&s;tants took every oc|ca&s;ion of pouring contempt upon it, the Emperor and King of the Romans found it nece&s;&s;ary not only to con|nive at their conduct, but to court their favour by repeated acts of indulgence. In the &s;ame Diet of Spires, wherein they had prote&s;ted in the mo&s;t di&s;re&s;pectful terms again&s;t a&s;&s;embling a council at Trent, Ferdinand, who depended on their aid for the defence of Hungary, not only permitted that prote&s;tation to be in&s;erted in the records of the Diet, but renewed in their favour all the Emperor's conce&s;&s;ions at Rati&s;bon, adding to them whatever they could demand for their farther &s;ecurity. Among other particulars, he granted a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of a decree of the Imperial chamber again&s;t the city of Go&s;|lar, one of tho&s;e which had entered into the league of
<PB N="19" REF="011837_0838_0F9D89A9B01B27B0">
Smalkalde, on account of its having &s;eized the eccle|&s;ia&s;tical revenues within its domains, and enjoined Henry Duke of Brun&s;wick to de&s;i&s;t from his attempts to carry that decree into execution. But Henry, a furious bigot, and no le&s;s ob&s;tinate than ra&s;h in all his undertakings, continuing to di&s;quiet the people of Go&s;lar by his in|cur&s;ions, the Elector of Saxony and Landgrave of He&s;&s;e, that they might not &s;uffer any member of the Smalkaldic body to be oppre&s;&s;ed, a&s;&s;embled their forces, declared war in form again&s;t Henry, and in the &s;pace of a few weeks &s;tript him entirely of his domi|nions, and drove him as a wretched exile to take refuge in the court of Bavaria. By this act of vengeance, no le&s;s &s;evere than &s;udden, they filled all Germany with dread of their power, and the confederates of Smalkalde appeared, by this fir&s;t effort of their arms, to be as prompt as capable to protect tho&s;e who had joined their a&s;&s;ociation <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 296.

<P>EMBOLDENED by &s;o many conce&s;&s;ions in their favour, as well as by the progre&s;s which their opinions daily made, the Princes of the league of Smalkalde took a &s;olemn prote&s;t again&s;t the Imperial chamber, and de|clined its juri&s;diction for the future, becau&s;e that court had not been vi&s;ited or reformed according to the decree of Rati&s;bon, and continued to di&s;cover a mo&s;t indecent partiality in all its proceedings.

<P>SUCH were the lengths to which the Prote&s;tants had proceeded, and &s;uch their confidence in their own power, when the Emperor returned from the Low-Countries, to hold a Diet, which he had &s;ummoned to meet at Spires.

and &s;ecular, with the deputies of mo&s;t of the cities were pre&s;ent. Charles &s;oon perceived that this was not a time to offend the jealous &s;pirit of the Prote&s;tants, by a&s;&s;erting in any high tone the authority and doctrines of the church, or by abridgi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g in the &s;malle&s;t article, the liberty which they now enjoyed; but that, on the con|trary, if he expected any &s;upport from them, or wi&s;hed to pre&s;erve Germany from inte&s;tine di&s;orders while he was engaged in a foreign war, he mu&s;t &s;ooth them by new conce&s;&s;ions, and a more ample exten&s;ion of their religious privileges. He began, accordingly, with courting the Elector of Saxony, and Landgrave of He&s;&s;e, the heads of the Prote&s;tant party, and by giving up &s;ome things in their favour, and granting liberal pro|mi&s;es with regard to others, he &s;ecured him&s;elf from any danger of oppo&s;ition on their part. Having a&s;certained this capital point, he then ventured to addre&s;s the Diet with greater freedom. He began by repre&s;enting his own zeal, and unwearied efforts with regard to two things mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential to Chri&s;tendom, the procuring of a gene|ral council, in order to compo&s;e the religious di&s;&s;en&s;ions which had unhappily ari&s;en in Germany, and the pro|viding &s;ome proper means for checking the formidable progre&s;s of the Turki&s;h arms; but that his pious en|deavours had been entirely defeated by the unju&s;tifiable ambition of the French King, who having wantonly kindled the flame of war in Europe, which had been &s;o lately extingui&s;hed by the truce of Nice, rendered it im|po&s;&s;ible for the fathers of the church to a&s;&s;emble in council, or to deliberate with &s;ecurity; and obliged him to employ tho&s;e forces in his own defence, which, with greater &s;atisfaction to him&s;elf, as well as more ho|nour to Chri&s;tendom, he would have turned again&s;t the Infidels: That Francis, not thinking it enough to have called him off from oppo&s;ing the Infidels, had, with unexampled impiety, invited them into the heart of Chri&s;tendom, and joining his arms to theirs, had openly attacked the Duke of Savoy, a member of the empire. That Barbaro&s;&s;a's fleet was now in one of the ports of France, waiting only the return of &s;pring, to carry ter|ror and de&s;olation to the coa&s;t of &s;ome Chri&s;tian &s;tate. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in &s;uch a &s;ituation it was folly to think of di&s;tant expeditions again&s;t the Turk, or of marching to oppo&s;e

his armies in Hungary, while &s;uch a powerful ally re|ceived him into the centre of Europe, and gave him footing there. That prudence dictated to oppo&s;e, fir&s;t of all, the neare&s;t and mo&s;t imminent danger, and by humbling the power of France, to deprive Solyman of the advantages, which he derived from the unnatural confederat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ed between him and a Monarch, who &s;till arrogated the name of Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian. That, in truth, a war again&s;t the French King and the Sultan ought to be con&s;idered as the &s;ame thing; and that eve|ry advantage gained over the former, was a &s;evere and &s;en&s;ible blow to the latter. That, therefore, he now demanded their aid again&s;t Francis, not merely as an enemy of the Germanic body, or of him who was its head, but as an avowed ally of the Infidels, and a pub|lic enemy to the Chri&s;tian name.</P>
<P>IN order to give greater weight to this violent invec|tive of the Emperor, the King of the Romans &s;tood up, and related the rapid conque&s;ts of the Sultan in Hun|gary, occa&s;ioned, as he &s;aid, by the fatal nece&s;&s;ity im|po&s;ed on his brother of employing his arms again&s;t France; and the amba&s;&s;adors of Savoy gave a detail of Barbaro&s;&s;a's operations at Nice, and of the ravages which he had committed on that coa&s;t. All the&s;e, added to the general indignation which Francis's unprecedented union with the Turks excited in Europe, made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion on the Diet as the Emperor wi&s;hed, and di&s;|po&s;ed mo&s;t of the members to grant him &s;uch effectual aid as he had demanded. The amba&s;&s;adors Francis had &s;ent to explain the motives of his conduct, were not permitted to enter the bounds of the empire; and the apology which they publi&s;hed for their ma&s;ter, vindi|cating his alliance with Solyman, by examples drawn from Scripture, and the practice of Chri&s;tian Princes, was little regarded by men, irritated already, or prejudiced again&s;t him to &s;uch a degree, as to be incapable of allow|ing their proper weight to any arguments in his behalf.</P>
<P>SUCH being the favourable di&s;po&s;ition of the Ger|mans, Charles perceived that nothing could now ob|&s;truct his gaining all that he aimed at, but the fears and jealou&s;ies of the Prote&s;tants, which he determined to quiet by granting every thing, that the utmo&s;t &s;olicitude of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions could de&s;ire for the &s;ecurity of their re|ligion.
<PB N="22" REF="011837_0841_0F9D89ABF21B50F8">
With this view, he con&s;ented to a rece&s;s, where|by all the rigorous edicts, hitherto i&s;&s;ued again&s;t the Prote&s;tants were &s;u&s;pended; a council either general or national to be a&s;&s;embled in Germany was declared ne|ce&s;&s;ary in order to re-e&s;tabli&s;h peace in the church; un|til one of the&s;e &s;hould be held, (which the Emperor un|dertook to bring about as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible) the free and public exerci&s;e of the Prote&s;tant religion was authorized; the Imperial chamber was to give no mole&s;tation to the Prote&s;tants; and when the term, for which the pre&s;ent judges in that court were elected, &s;hould expire, per&s;ons duly qualified were then to be admitted as members, without any di&s;tinction on account of religion. In re|turn for the&s;e extraordinary acts of indulgence, the Pro|te&s;tants concurred, with the other members of the Diet, in declaring war again&s;t Francis, in the name of the em|pire; in voting the Emperor a body of twenty-four thou&s;and foot, and four thou&s;and hor&s;e, to be main|tained at the public expence for &s;ix months, and to be employed again&s;t France; and at the &s;ame time the Diet impo&s;ed a poll-tax to be levied throughout all Germany, on every per&s;on without exception, for the &s;upport of the war again&s;t the Turks.</P>
<P>CHARLES, while he gave the greate&s;t attention to the minute and intricate detail of particulars nece&s;&s;ary to|wards conducting the deliberations of a numerous and divided a&s;&s;embly to &s;uch a &s;ucce&s;sful period, negociated a &s;eparate peace with the King of Denmark, who, tho' he had hitherto performed nothing con&s;iderable in con|&s;equence of his alliance with Francis, had it in his pow|er, however, to make a formidable diver&s;ion in favour of that Monarch <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Dumont Corps Diplom. t. iv. p. ii. p. 274.</NOTE>. At the &s;ame time, he did not ne|glect proper applications to the King of England, in order to rouze him to more vigorous efforts again&s;t their common enemy. Little, indeed, was wanting to ac|compli&s;h this; for &s;uch events had happened in Scot|land, as inflamed Henry to the mo&s;t violent pitch of re|&s;entment again&s;t Francis. Having concluded with the parliament of Scotland, a treaty of marriage between his &s;on and their young Queen, by which he reckoned him&s;elf &s;ecure of effecting the union of the two king|doms, which had been long de&s;ired, and often attempt|ed

Henry, however, did not aban|don an object of &s;o much importance. As the hum|bling of Francis, be&s;ides the plea&s;ure of taking revenge upon an enemy who had di&s;appointed a favourite mea|&s;ure, appeared the mo&s;t effectual method of bringing the Scots to accept once more of the treaty which they had rejected; he was &s;o fond of this &s;cheme, that he was ready to &s;econd whatever the Emperor could pro|po&s;e to be attempted again&s;t that Monarch. The plan, accordingly, which they concerted, was &s;uch as, if it had been punctually executed, mu&s;t have ruined France in the fir&s;t place, and would have augmented &s;o prodi|giou&s;ly the Emperor's power and territories as might in the end have proved fatal to the liberties of Europe. They agreed to invade France, each with an army of twenty-five thou&s;and men, and, without lo&s;ing time in be&s;ieging the frontier towns, to advance directly to|wards the interior provinces, and to join their forces near Paris <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Herbert 245.

<P>MEANWHILE, Francis &s;tood alone in oppo&s;ition to all the enemies that Charles was mu&s;tering again&s;t him. Solyman was the only ally who had not de&s;erted him; but the a&s;&s;i&s;tance he received from him had rendered him &s;o odious to all Chri&s;tendom, that he re&s;olved rather to forego all the advantages of his friend&s;hip, than to become, on that account, the object of general horror and dete&s;tation. For this rea&s;on, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed Barba|ro&s;&s;a as &s;oon as winter was over, who, after ravaging the coa&s;ts of Naples and Tu&s;cany, returned to Con|&s;tantinople. As Francis could not hope to equal the forces of his rival, he endeavoured to &s;upply that defect by di&s;patch, which was more in his power, and to get the &s;tart of him in taking the field. Early in the &s;pring the Count d'Enguien inve&s;ted Carignan, a town in Pied|mont, which the Marquis de Gua&s;to, the Imperial ge|neral, having &s;urprized the former year, con&s;idered as
<PB N="24" REF="011837_0843_0F9D89AD6E24F530">
of &s;o much importance, that he had fortified it at great expence. The Count pu&s;hed the &s;iege with &s;uch vi|gour, that Gua&s;to, fond of his own conque&s;t, and &s;ee|ing no other way of &s;aving it from falling into the hands of the French, re&s;olved to hazard a battle in order to relieve it. He began his march from Milan for this purpo&s;e, and as he was at no pains to conceal his inten|tion, it was &s;oon known in the French camp. Enguien, a gallant and enterprizing young man, wi&s;hed pa&s;&s;ion|ately to try the fortune of a battle; his troops de&s;ired it with no le&s;s ardour; but the peremptory injunction of the King not to venture a general engagement, flowing from a prudent attention to the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of affairs, as well as from the remembrance of former di&s;a&s;ters, tied up his hands. Unwilling, however, to abandon Carignan, when it was ju&s;t ready to yield, and eager to di&s;tingui&s;h his command by &s;ome memorable action, he di&s;patched Monluc to court, in order to lay before the King the advantages of fighting the enemy, and the hopes which he had of victory. The King re|ferred the matter to the council; all the mini&s;ters de|clared, one after another, again&s;t fighting, and &s;up|ported their &s;entiments by rea&s;ons extremely plau&s;ible.

Upon this, Monluc, a plai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, but &s;pirited &s;oldier, and of known courage, repre&s;ented the good condition of the troops, their eagerne&s;s to meet the enemy in the field, their con|fidence in their officers, together with the everla&s;ting infamy which the declining of a battle would bring on the French arms; and urged his arguments with &s;uch lively impetuo&s;ity, and &s;uch a flow of military eloquence, as gained over to his opinion, not only the King, natu|rally fond of daring actions, but &s;everal of the council. Francis, catching the &s;ame enthu&s;ia&s;m which had ani|mated his troops, &s;uddenly &s;tarted up, and having lifted his hands to heaven, and implored the divine protec|tion

and aid, he then addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to Monluc, "Go," &s;ays he, "return to Piedmont, and fight in the name of God <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Memoires de Monluc.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>NO &s;ooner was it known that the King had given En|guien leave to fight the Imperiali&s;ts, than &s;uch was the martial ardour of the gallant and high &s;pirited gentle|men of that age, that the court was quite de&s;erted, eve|ry per&s;on de&s;irous of reputation, or capable of &s;ervice, hurrying to Piedmont in order to &s;hare, as volunteers, in the danger and glory of the action. Encouraged by the arrival of &s;o many brave officers, Enguien imme|diately prepared for battle, nor did Gua&s;to decline the combat. The number of cavalry was almo&s;t equal, but the Imperial infantry exceeded the French by at lea&s;t ten thou&s;and men. They met near Ceri&s;oles, in an open plain, which afforded to neither any advantage of ground, and both had full time to form their army in proper order. The &s;hock was &s;uch as might have been expected between veteran troops, violent and ob&s;tinate. The French cavalry running to the charge with their u&s;ual vivacity, bore down every thing that oppo&s;ed them, but on the other hand, the &s;teady and di&s;ciplined valour of the Spani&s;h infantry having forced the body which they encountered to give way, victory remained in &s;u&s;pence, ready to declare for which ever general could make the be&s;t u&s;e of that critical moment. Gua&s;|to, engaged in that part of his army which was thrown into di&s;order, and afraid of falling into the hands of the French, who&s;e vengeance he dreaded on account of the murder of Rincon and Frego&s;o, lo&s;t his pre&s;ence of mind, and forgot to order a large body of re&s;erve to ad|vance; whereas Enguien, with admirable courage and equal conduct, &s;upported, at the head of his gens d'armes, &s;uch of his battalions as began to yield; and at the &s;ame time he ordered the Swi&s;s in his &s;ervice, who had been victorious wherever they fought, to fall upon the Spaniards. This motion proved deci&s;ive. All that followed was confu&s;ion and &s;laughter. The Marquis de Gua&s;to wounded in the thigh, e&s;caped only by the &s;wift|ne&s;s of his hor&s;e. The victory of the French was com|plete, ten thou&s;and of the Imperiali&s;ts being &s;lain, and a

con&s;iderable number, with all their tents, baggage and artillery, taken. On the part of the conquerors, their joy was without allay, a few only being killed, and among the&s;e no officer of di&s;tinction <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Bellay, 429, &amp;c. Memoires de Monluc.

<P>THIS &s;plendid action, be&s;ides the reputation with which it was attended, delivered France from an immi|nent danger, as it ruined the army with which Gua&s;to had intended to invade the country between the Rho&s;ne and Saone, where there were neither fortified towns nor regular forces to oppo&s;e his progre&s;s. But it was not in Francis's power to pur&s;ue the victory with &s;uch vi|gour as to reap the advantages which it might have yielded; for though the Milane&s;e remained now almo&s;t defencele&s;s; though the inhabitants who had long mur|mured under the rigour of the Imperial government, were ready to throw off the yoke; though Enguien, flu&s;hed with &s;ucce&s;s, urged the King to &s;eize this happy opportunity of recovering a country, the acqui&s;ition of which had been long his favourite object; yet as the Emperor and King of England were preparing to break in upon the oppo&s;ite frontier of France with &s;uch &s;upe|rior force, it became nece&s;&s;ary to &s;acrifice all thoughts of conque&s;t to the public &s;afety, and to recal twelve thou&s;and of Enguien's be&s;t troops to be employed in de|fence of the kingdom. Enguien's &s;ub&s;equent opera|tions were, of con&s;equence, &s;o languid and incon&s;ider|able, that the reduction of Carignan and &s;ome other towns in Piedmont, was all he gained by his great vic|tory at Ceri&s;oles <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Bellay, 438, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Emperor, as u&s;ual, was late in taking the field, but he appeared, towards the beginning of June, at the head of an army more numerous, and better appointed than any which he had hitherto led again&s;t France. It amounted almo&s;t to fifty thou&s;and men, and part of it having reduced Luxembourg and &s;ome other towns in the Netherlands, before he him&s;elf joined it, he now marched with the whole towards the frontiers of Cham|pagne. Charles, according to his agreement with the King of England, ought to have advanced directly to|wards

Paris; and the Dauphin, who commanded the only army to which Francis tru&s;ted for the &s;ecurity of his dominions, was in no condition to oppo&s;e him. But the &s;ucce&s;s with which the French had defended Pro|vence in the year one thou&s;and five hundred and thirty-&s;ix, had taught them the mo&s;t effectual method of di|&s;tre&s;&s;ing an invading enemy. Champagne, a country abounding more in vines than corn, was incapable of maintaining a great army, and before the Emperor's approach, whatever could be of any u&s;e to him had been carried off or de&s;troyed. This rendered it nece&s;&s;ary for him to be ma&s;ter of &s;ome places of &s;trength, in order to &s;ecure the convoys on which alone he now perceived that he mu&s;t depend for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; and he found the frontier towns &s;o ill provided for defence, that he hoped it would not be a work either of much time or diffi|culty to reduce them. Accordingly, Ligny and Com|mercy, which he fir&s;t attacked, &s;urrendered after a &s;hort re&s;i&s;tance. He then inve&s;ted St. Di&s;ier, which, though it commanded an important pa&s;s on the Marne, was de&s;titute of every thing nece&s;&s;ary for &s;u&s;taining a &s;iege. But the Count de Sancerre and M. de la Lande, who had acquired &s;uch reputation by the defence of Landrecy, generou&s;ly threw them&s;elves into the town, and undertook to hold it out to the la&s;t extremity. The Emperor &s;oon found how capable they were of making good their promi&s;e, and that he could not expect to take the town without be&s;ieging it in form. This accord|ingly he undertook; and as it was his nature never to abandon any enterprize in which he had once engaged, he per&s;i&s;ted in it with an incon&s;iderate ob&s;tinacy.</P>
<P>THE King of England's preparations for the cam|paign were compleat long before the Emperor's; but as he did not choo&s;e, on the one hand, to encounter alone the whole power of France, and was unwilling, on the other, that his troops &s;hould remain unactive, he took that opportunity of cha&s;ti&s;ing the Scots, by &s;ending his fleet, together with a con&s;iderable part of his infantry, under the Earl of Hertford, to invade their country. Hertford executed his commi&s;&s;ion with vigour, plun|dered and burnt Edinburgh and Leith, laid wa&s;te the adjacent country, and reimbarked his men with &s;uch
<PB N="28" REF="011837_0847_0F9D89CD08C0BCE8">
di&s;patch, that they joined their Sovereign &s;oon after his landing in France. When Henry arrived in that kingdom, he found the Emperor engaged in the &s;iege of St. Di&s;ier; an amba&s;&s;ador, however, whom he &s;ent to congratulate the Engli&s;h Monarch on his &s;afe arrival on the continent, &s;olicited him to march, in terms of the treaty, directly to Paris. But Charles had &s;et his ally &s;uch an ill example of fulfilling the conditions of their confederacy with exactne&s;s, that Henry, ob&s;erving him employ his time and forces in taking towns for his own behoof, &s;aw no rea&s;on why he &s;hould not attempt the reduction of &s;ome places that lay conveniently for him|&s;elf. Without paying any regard to the Emperor's re|mon&s;trances, he immediately inve&s;ted Bologne, and commanded the Duke of Norfolk to pre&s;s the &s;iege of Montreuil, which had been begun before his arrival, by a body of Flemings, in conjunction with &s;ome Engli&s;h troops. While Charles and Henry &s;hewed &s;uch atten|tion each to his own intere&s;t, they both neglected the common cau&s;e; and, in&s;tead of the union and confi|dence requi&s;ite towards conducting the great plan they had formed, they early di&s;covered a mutual jealou&s;y of each other, which, by degrees, begot di&s;tru&s;t, and end|ed in open hatred <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Herbert.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, Francis had, with unwearied indu&s;try, drawn together an army capable, as well from the number as from the valour of the troops, of making head again&s;t the enemy. But the Dauphin, who &s;till acted as gene|ral, prudently declining a battle, the lo&s;s of which would have endangered the kingdom, &s;atisfied him&s;elf with hara&s;&s;ing the Emperor with his light troops, cut|ting off his convoys, and laying wa&s;te the country around him. Though extremely di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the&s;e operations, Charles &s;till pre&s;&s;ed the &s;iege of St. Di&s;ier, which Sancerre defended with a&s;toni&s;hing fortitude and conduct. He &s;tood repeated a&s;&s;aults, repul&s;ing the enemy in them all; and undi&s;mayed even by the death of the brave de la Lande, who was killed by a cannon ball, he continued to &s;hew the &s;ame bold countenance and ob&s;tinate re&s;olution. At the end of five weeks he
<PB N="29" REF="011837_0848_0F9D89CF2BDF1FF8">
was &s;till capable of holding out &s;ome time longer, when an artifice of Granvelle's induced him to &s;urrender. That crafty politician, having intercepted the key to the cypher which the Duke of Gui&s;e u&s;ed in commu|nicating intelligence to Sancerre, forged a letter in his name, authorizing Sancerre to capitulate, as the King, though highly &s;atisfied with his behaviour, thought it imprudent to hazard a battle for his relief. This letter he conveyed into the town in a manner which could rai&s;e no &s;u&s;picion, and the governor fell into the &s;nare. Even then, he obtained &s;uch honourable conditions as his gallant defence merited, and among others a ce&s;&s;a|tion of ho&s;tilities for eight days, at the expiration of which he bound him&s;elf to open the gates, if Francis, during that time, did not attack the Imperial army, and throw fre&s;h troops into the town <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Brantome, tom. vi. 489.</NOTE>. Thus Sancerre, by detaining the Emperor &s;o long before an incon&s;iderable place, afforded his Sovereign full time to a&s;&s;emble all his forces, and, what rarely falls to an officer in &s;uch an inferior command, acquired the glory of having &s;aved his country.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as St. Di&s;ier &s;urrendered, the Emperor ad|vanced into the heart of Champagne, but Sancerre's ob|&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance had damped his &s;anguine hopes of pe|netrating to Paris, and led him &s;eriou&s;ly to reflect on what he might expect before towns of greater &s;trength, and defended by more numerous garri&s;ons. At the &s;ame time, the procuring &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for his army was attended with great difficulty, which increa&s;ed in pro|portion as he withdrew from his own frontier. He had lo&s;t a great number of his be&s;t troops in the &s;iege of St. Di&s;ier, and many fell daily in &s;kirmi&s;hes, which it was not in his power to avoid, though they wa&s;ted his army in&s;en&s;ibly, without leading to any deci&s;ive action. The &s;ea&s;on advanced apace, and he had not yet the command either of a &s;ufficient extent of territory, or of any &s;uch con&s;iderable town as rendered it &s;afe to winter in the enemy's country. Great arrears too, were due to his &s;oldiers, who were upon the point of mutinying for their pay, while he knew not from what funds to &s;atisfy
<PB N="30" REF="011837_0849_0F9D89CF4B9410C8">
them. All the&s;e con&s;iderations induced him to li&s;ten to the overtures of peace which a Spani&s;h Dominican, the confe&s;&s;or of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;i&s;ter the Queen of France, had &s;ecretly made to his confe&s;&s;or, a monk of the &s;ame order. In con&s;equence of this, plenipotentiaries were named on both &s;ides, and began their conferences in Chau&s;&s;e, a &s;mall village near Chalons. At the &s;ame time, Charles, either from a de&s;ire of making one great final effort again&s;t France, or merely to gain a pretext for de&s;erting his ally and concluding a &s;eparate peace, &s;ent an amba&s;|&s;ador formally to require Henry, according to the &s;tipu|lation in their treaty, to advance towards Paris. While he expected a return from him, and waited the i&s;&s;ue of the conferences at Chau&s;&s;e, he continued to march for|ward, though in the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s from &s;carcity of pro|vi&s;ions. But at la&s;t, by a fortunate motion on his part, or through &s;ome neglect or treachery on that of the French, he &s;urprized fir&s;t E&s;pernay and then Chateau Thierry, in both which were con&s;iderable magazines. No &s;ooner was it known that the&s;e towns, the latter of which is not two days march from Paris, were in the hands of the enemy, than that great capital, defencele&s;s, and &s;u&s;ceptible of any violent alarm in proportion to its greatne&s;s, was filled with con&s;ternation. The inhabi|tants, as if the Emperor had been already at their gates, fled in the wilde&s;t confu&s;ion and de&s;pair, many &s;ending their wives and children down the Seine to Rou&euml;n, others to Orleans, and the towns upon the Loire. Fran|cis him&s;elf, more afflicted with this than with any other event during his reign, and &s;en&s;ible as well of the tri|umph his rival would enjoy in in&s;ulting his capital, as of the danger to which the kingdom was expo&s;ed, could not refrain, in the fir&s;t emotion of his &s;urprize and &s;or|row, from crying out, "How dear, O my God, do I pay for this crown, which I thought thou had&s;t granted me freely <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Brantome, tom. vi. 381.</NOTE>." But recovering in a moment from this &s;udden &s;ally of peevi&s;hne&s;s and impatience, he devoutly added, "Thy will, however, be done;" and proceeded to i&s;&s;ue the nece&s;&s;ary orders for oppo&s;ing the enemy with his u&s;ual compo&s;ure and pre&s;ence of mind. The
<PB N="31" REF="011837_0850_0F9D89D01B17B310">
Dauphin detached eight thou&s;and men to Paris, which revived the courage of the affrighted citizens; he threw a &s;trong garri&s;on into Meaux, and by a forced march, got into Ferte, between the Imperiali&s;ts and the capital.</P>
<P>UPON this, the Emperor who began again to feel the want of provi&s;ions, perceiving that the Dauphin &s;till prudently declined a battle, and not daring to attack his camp with forces &s;o much &s;hattered and reduced by hard &s;ervice, turned &s;uddenly to the right, and began to fall back towards Soi&s;&s;ons. Having about this time re|ceived Henry's an&s;wer, whereby he refu&s;ed to abandon the &s;ieges of Bologne and Montreuil, of both which he expected every moment to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he thought him&s;elf ab&s;olved from all obligations of adhering to the treaty with him, and at full liberty to con&s;ult his own in|tere&s;t in what manner &s;oever he plea&s;ed. He con&s;ented, therefore, to renew the conference, which the &s;urprize of E&s;pernay had broke off. To conclude a peace between two Princes, one of whom greatly de&s;ired, and the other greatly needed it, did not require a long negociation. It was &s;igned at Cre&s;py, a &s;mall town near Meaux, on the eighteenth of September. The chief articles of it were, That all the conque&s;ts which either party had made &s;ince the truce of Nice &s;hall be re&s;tored; that the Em|peror &s;hall give in marriage to the Duke of Orleans, ei|ther his own elde&s;t daughter, or the &s;econd daughter of his brother Ferdinand; that if he cho&s;e to be&s;tow on him his own daughter, he &s;hall &s;ettle on her all the pro|vinces of the Low-Countries, to be erected into an in|dependent &s;tate, which &s;hall de&s;cend to the male i&s;&s;ue of the marriage; that if he determined to give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is niece, he &s;hall, with her, grant him the inve&s;titure of Milan and its dependencies; that he &s;hall within four months declare which of the&s;e two Prince&s;&s;es he had pitched upon, and fulfil the re&s;pective conditions upon the con|&s;ummation of the marriage, which &s;hall take place with|in a year from the date of the treaty; that as &s;oon as the Duke of Orleans is put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion either of the Low-Countries or of Milan, Francis &s;hall re&s;tore to the Duke of Savoy all that he now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es of his territories, except Pignerol and Montmilian; that Francis &s;hall re|nounce all preten&s;ions to the kingdom of Naples, or to

<P>BESIDES the immediate motives to this peace ari&s;ing from the di&s;tre&s;s of his army through want of provi&s;ions; from the difficulty of retreating out of France; and the impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;ecuring winter-quarters there; the Em|peror was influenced by other con&s;iderations, more di&s;|tant, indeed, but not le&s;s weighty. The Pope was of|fended to a great degree, as well at his conce&s;&s;ions to the Prote&s;tants in the late Diet, as at his con&s;enting to call a council, and to admit of public di&s;putations in Germany, with a view of determining the doctrines in controver&s;y; and con&s;idering both the&s;e &s;teps as &s;acrile|gious encroachments on the juri&s;diction as well as privi|leges of the holy &s;ee, he had addre&s;&s;ed to him a remon|&s;trance, rather than a letter on this &s;ubject, written with &s;uch acrimony of language, and in a &s;tile of &s;uch high authority, as di&s;covered more of an intention to draw on a quarrel, than of a de&s;ire to reclaim him. This ill humour was not a little enflamed by the Emperor's league with Henry, which being contracted with an he|retic, excommunicated by the apo&s;tolic &s;ee, appeared to the Pope a profane alliance, and was not le&s;s dreaded by him, than that of Francis with Solyman. Paul's &s;on and grand&s;on, highly incen&s;ed at the Emperor for having refu&s;ed to gratify them with regard to the alie|nation of Parma and Placentia, contributed by their in|fu&s;ions to &s;our and di&s;gu&s;t him &s;till more. To all which was added the powerful operation of the flattery and promi&s;es which Francis ince&s;&s;antly employed to gain him. Though from his de&s;ire of maintaining a neutra|lity, the Pope had hitherto &s;uppre&s;&s;ed his own re&s;ent|ment, had eluded the artifices of his own family, and re&s;i&s;ted the &s;olicitations of the French King, it was not

&s;afe to rely much on the &s;teadine&s;s of a man whom his pa&s;&s;ions, his friends, and his intere&s;t combined to &s;hake. The union of the Pope with France, Charles well knew would in&s;tantly expo&s;e his dominions in Italy to be attacked. The Venetians, he fore&s;aw, would pro|bably follow the example of a Pontiff, who was con&s;idered as a model of a political wi&s;dom among the Italians; and thus, at a juncture, when he felt him&s;elf &s;carce equal to the burthen of the pre&s;ent war, he would be overwhelmed with the weight of a new confederacy again&s;t him <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">F.

At the &s;ame time, the Turks, almo&s;t unre&s;i&s;ted, made &s;uch progre&s;s in Hun|gary, reducing town after town, that they approached near to the confines of the Au&s;trian provinces <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">I&s;luanhaffii.

Above all the&s;e, the extraordinary progre&s;s of the Prote&s;tant doctrines in Germany, and the dangerous combination into which the Princes of that profe&s;&s;ion had entered, called for his immediate attention. Almo&s;t one half of Germany had revolted from the e&s;tabli&s;hed church; the fidelity of the re&s;t was much &s;haken; the nobility of Au&s;tria had demanded of Ferdinand the free exerci&s;e of religion <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 285.</NOTE>; the Bohemians, among whom &s;ome &s;eeds of the doctrines of Hu&s;s &s;till remained, openly favoured the new opinions; the archbi&s;hop of Cologne, with a zeal rare among eccle&s;ia&s;tics, had begun the reformation of his dioce&s;e; nor was it po&s;&s;ible, unle&s;s &s;ome timely and effectual check were given to the &s;pirit of innova|tion, to fore&s;ee where it would end.

If, therefore, he wi&s;hed to maintain either the antient religion, or his own autho|rity, and would not choo&s;e to dwindle into a mere no|minal head of the empire, &s;ome vigorous effort was re|qui&s;ite, which could not be made during a war that re|quired

the greate&s;t exertion of his &s;trength again&s;t a fo|reign and powerful enemy.</P>
<P>SUCH being the Emperor's inducements to peace, he had the addre&s;s to frame the treaty of Cre&s;py, &s;o as to promote all the ends which he had in view. By coming to an agreement with Francis, he took from the Pope all pro&s;pect of advantage, in courting the friend&s;hip of that Monarch, in preference to his. By the provi&s;o with regard to a war with the Turks, he not only deprived Solyman of a powerful ally, but turned the arms of that ally again&s;t him. By a private article, not in&s;erted in the treaty, that it might not rai&s;e any un&s;ea&s;onable alarm, he agreed with Francis that both &s;hould exert all their influence and power, in order to procure a general council, to a&s;&s;ert its authority, and to exterminate the Prote&s;tant here&s;y out of their dominions. This cut off all hopes of a&s;&s;i&s;tance which the confederates of Smalkalde might expect from the French King <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Seck. l. iii. 496.</NOTE>; and le&s;t their &s;olicitations, or his jealou&s;y of an antient rival, &s;hould hereafter tempt Francis to forget this engagement, he left him embara&s;&s;ed with a war again&s;t England, which would put it out of his power to take any part in the af|fairs of Germany.</P>
<P>HENRY, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at all times with an high idea of his own power and importance, felt, in the mo&s;t &s;en|&s;ible manner, the neglect with which the Emperor had treated him in concluding a &s;eparate peace. But the &s;ituation of his affairs was &s;uch as &s;omewhat alleviated the mortification which this occa&s;ioned. For though he was obliged to recal the Duke of Norfolk from the &s;iege of Montreuil, becau&s;e the Flemi&s;h troops received orders to retire, Bologne had &s;urrendered before the negociations at Cre&s;py were brought to an i&s;&s;ue. While elated with vanity on account of this conque&s;t, and in|flamed with indignation again&s;t the Emperor, the am|ba&s;&s;adors whom Francis &s;ent to make overtures of peace, found him too arrogant to grant what was moderate or equitable. His demands were indeed extravagant, and made in the tone of a conqueror; that Francis &s;hould renounce his alliance with Scotland, and not only pay

<P>THE treaty of peace, how acceptable &s;oever to the people of France, whom it delivered from the dread of an enemy who had penetrated into the heart of the king|dom, was loudly complained of by the Dauphin. He con&s;idered it as a manife&s;t proof of the King his father's extraordinary partiality towards his younger brother, now Duke of Orleans, and complained that from his ea|gerne&s;s to gain an e&s;tabli&s;hment for a favourite &s;on, he had &s;acrificed the honour of the kingdom, and re|nounced the mo&s;t antient and valuable rights of the crown. But as he dur&s;t not venture to offend the King by refu&s;ing to ratify it, though extremely de&s;irous at the &s;ame time of &s;ecuring to him&s;elf the privilege of re|claiming what was now alienated &s;o much to his detri|ment, he &s;ecretly prote&s;ted, in pre&s;ence of &s;ome of his adherents, again&s;t the whole tran&s;action; and declared, whatever he &s;hould be obliged to do in order to con|firm it, null in it&s;elf, and void of all obligation.

Every circum&s;tance &s;eemed to promi&s;e the continuance of peace. The Emperor, cruelly afflicted with the gout, appeared to be in no condition to undertake any enter|prize where great activity was requi&s;ite, or much fatigue to be endured. He him&s;elf felt this, or wi&s;hed at lea&s;t that it &s;hould be believed; and being &s;o much di&s;abled by this excrutiating di&s;temper, when a French amba&s;&s;a|dor followed him to Bru&s;&s;els, in order to be pre&s;ent at his ratification of the treaty of peace, that it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty he &s;igned his name; he ob&s;erved, that there was no great danger of his violating the&s;e articles, as a hand that could &s;carce hold a pen, was little able to brandi&s;h a lance.</P>
<P>THE violence of his di&s;ea&s;e confined the Emperor &s;e|veral months in Bru&s;&s;els, and was the apparent cau&s;e of putting off the execution of the va&s;t &s;chemes which he had formed in order to humble the Prote&s;tant party in Germany. But there were other rea&s;ons for this de|lay. For, how prevalent &s;oever the motives were which determined him to undertake this enterprize, the nature of that great body which he was about to at|tack, as well as the &s;ituation of his own affairs, made it nece&s;&s;ary to deliberate long, to proceed with caution, and not to throw a&s;ide too &s;uddenly the veil under which he had hitherto concealed his real &s;entiments and &s;chemes. He was &s;en&s;ible that the Prote&s;tants, con|&s;cious of their own &s;trength, but under continual ap|prehen&s;ions of his de&s;igns, had all the boldne&s;s of a powerful party, and all the jealou&s;y of a feeble faction; and were no le&s;s quick-&s;ighted to di&s;cern the fir&s;t ap|pearance of danger, than ready to take arms in order to repel it. At the &s;ame time, he continued involved in a Turki&s;h war; and though, in order to deliver him&s;elf from this incumbrance, he had determined to &s;end an envoy to the Porte, with mo&s;t advantageous, and even &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive overtures of peace, the re&s;olutions of that haughty court were &s;o uncertain, that before the&s;e were known, it would have been the height of imprudence to have kindled the flames of civil war in his own domi|nions.</P>
<P>UPON this account, he appeared di&s;&s;atisfied with a bull i&s;&s;ued by the Pope immediately after the peace of
<PB N="37" REF="011837_0856_0F9D89D6CC474F80">
Cre&s;py, &s;ummoning the council to a&s;&s;emble at Trent ear|ly next &s;pring, and exhorting all Chri&s;tian Princes to embrace the opportuity that the pre&s;ent happy interval of tranquillity afforded them, of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e he|re&s;ies which threatened to &s;ubvert whatever was &s;acred or venerable among Chri&s;tians. But after &s;uch a &s;light expre&s;&s;ion of di&s;like, as was nece&s;&s;ary, in order to cover his de&s;igns, he determined to countenance the council, which might become no incon&s;iderable in&s;trument towards accompli&s;hing his projects, and therefore not only appointed amba&s;&s;adors to appear there in his name, but ordered the eccle&s;ia&s;tics in his dominions to attend at the time prefixed <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">F. Paul, 104.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SUCH were the Emperor's views, when the Imperial Diet, after &s;everal prorogations, was opened at Worms. The Prote&s;tants, who enjoyed the free exerci&s;e of their religion by a very precarious tenure, having no other &s;ecurity for it than the rece&s;s of the la&s;t Diet, which was to continue in force only until the meeting of a coun|cil, wi&s;hed earne&s;tly to e&s;tabli&s;h that important privi|lege upon &s;ome firmer ba&s;is, and to hold it by a perpe|tual, not a temporary title. But, in&s;tead of offering them any additional &s;ecurity, Ferdinand opened the Diet with ob&s;erving, that there were two points, chiefly, which required con&s;ideration; the pro&s;ecution of the war again&s;t the Turks, and the &s;tate of religion; that the former was the mo&s;t urgent, as Solyman, after conquer|ing the greate&s;t part of Hungary, was now ready to fall upon the Au&s;trian provinces; that the Emperor, who, from the beginning of his reign, had neglected no opportunity of annoying this formidable enemy, and with the hazard of his own per&s;on, had re&s;i&s;ted his at|tacks, being animated &s;till with the &s;ame zeal, had now con&s;ented to &s;top &s;hort in the career of his &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t France, that, in conjunction with his antient rival, he might turn his arms with greater vigour again&s;t the common adver&s;ary of the Chri&s;tian faith; that it became all the members of the empire to &s;econd the&s;e pious endeavours of its head; that, therefore, they ought, without delay, to vote him &s;uch effectual
<PB N="38" REF="011837_0857_0F9D89D78FF12D40">
aid as both their duty, and their intere&s;t, called upon them to furni&s;h; that the controver&s;ies about religion were &s;o intricate, and of &s;uch difficult di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, as to give no hope of its being po&s;&s;ible to bring them at pre&s;ent to any final i&s;&s;ue; that by per&s;everance and repeated &s;o|licitations the Emperor had at length prevailed on the Pope to call a council, for which they had &s;o often wi&s;hed and petitioned; that the time appointed for its meeting was now come, and both parties ought to wait for its decrees, and &s;ubmit to them as the deci&s;ions of the uni|ver&s;al church.</P>
<P>THE popi&s;h members of the Diet received this de|claration with great applau&s;e, and &s;ignified their entire acquie&s;cence in every particular which it contained. The Prote&s;tants expre&s;&s;ed great &s;urprize at propo&s;itions, which were &s;o manife&s;tly repugnant to the rece&s;s of the former Diet; they in&s;i&s;ted that the que&s;tions with regard to religion, as fir&s;t in dignity and importance, ought to come fir&s;t under deliberation; that alarming as the pro|gre&s;s of the Turks was to all Germany, the &s;ecuring the free exerci&s;e of their religion touched them &s;till more nearly, nor could they pro&s;ecute a foreign war with &s;pi|rit, while &s;olicitous and concerned about their dome&s;tic tranquillity; that if the latter were once rendered firm and permanent, they would concur with their country|men in pu&s;hing the former, and yield to none of them in activity or zeal. But if the danger from the Turk|i&s;h arms was indeed &s;o imminent, as not to admit of &s;uch a delay as would be occa&s;ioned by an immediate examination of the controverted points in religion, they required that a Diet &s;hould be in&s;tantly appointed, to which the final &s;ettlement of their religious di&s;putes &s;hould be referred; and that, in the mean time, the de|cree of the former Diet, concerning religion, &s;hould be explained in a point which they deemed e&s;&s;ential. By the rece&s;s of Spires it was provided, that they &s;hould en|joy unmole&s;ted the public exerci&s;e of their religion, un|til the meeting of a legal council; but as the Pope had now called a council, to which Ferdinand had required them to &s;ubmit, they began to &s;u&s;pect that their adver|&s;aries might take advantage of an ambiguity in the terms of the rece&s;s, and pretending that the event therein men|tioned
<PB N="39" REF="011837_0858_0F9D89D857C47900">
had taken place, might pronounce them to be no longer intitled to the &s;ame indulgence. In order to guard again&s;t this interpretation, they renewed their former remon&s;trances again&s;t a council called to meet without the bounds of the empire, &s;ummoned by the Pope's authority, and in which he a&s;&s;umed the right of pre&s;iding; and declared, that notwith&s;tanding the con|vocation of any &s;uch illegal a&s;&s;embly, they &s;till held the rece&s;s of the late Diet to be in full force.</P>
<P>AT other junctures, when the Emperor thought it of advantage to &s;ooth and gain the Prote&s;tants, he had devi&s;|ed expedients for giving them &s;atisfaction, with regard to demands &s;eemingly more extravagant; but his views at pre&s;ent being very different, Ferdinand, by his com|mand, adhered inflexibly to his fir&s;t propo&s;itions, and would make no conce&s;&s;ions which had the mo&s;t remote tendency to throw di&s;credit on the council, or to weaken its authority. The Prote&s;tants, on their part, were no le&s;s inflexible; and after much time &s;pent in fruitle&s;s endeavours to convince each other, they came to no conclu&s;ion. Nor did the pre&s;ence of the Emperor, who upon his recovery arrived at Worms, contribute in any degree to render the Prote&s;tants more compliant. Fully convinced that they were maintaining the cau&s;e of God and of truth, they &s;hewed them&s;elves &s;uperior to the allurements of intere&s;t, or the &s;ugge&s;tions of fear; and in proportion as the Emperor redoubled his &s;olicita|tions, or di&s;covered his de&s;igns, their boldne&s;s &s;eems to have increa&s;ed. At la&s;t they openly declared, that they would not even deign to vindicate their tenets in pre|&s;ence of a council, a&s;&s;embled not to examine, but to condemn them; and that they would pay no regard to an a&s;&s;embly held under the influence of a Pope, who had already precluded him&s;elf from all title to act as a judge, by his having &s;tigmatized their opinions with the name of here&s;y, and denounced again&s;t them the hea|vie&s;t cen&s;ures, which, in the plenitude of his u&s;urped power, he could inflict <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 343, &amp;c. Seck. iii. 543, &amp;c. Thuan. Hi&s;tor. lib. ii. p. 56.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHILE the Prote&s;tants, with &s;uch union as well as firmne&s;s, rejected all intercour&s;e with the council, and
<PB N="40" REF="011837_0859_0F9D89D94A2FE900">
refu&s;ed their a&s;&s;ent to the Imperial demands in re&s;pect to the Turki&s;h war, Maurice of Saxony alone &s;hewed an inclination to gratify the Emperor with regard to both. Though he profe&s;&s;ed an inviolable regard for the Pro|te&s;tant religion, he a&s;&s;umed an appearance of modera|tion peculiar to him&s;elf, by which he confirmed the fa|vourable &s;entiments that the Emperor already enter|tained of him, and gradually paved the way for execut|ing the ambitious de&s;igns which always occupied his ac|tive and enterprizing mind <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Seck. iii. 571.</NOTE>. His example, however, had little influence upon &s;uch as agreed with him in their religious opinions; and Charles perceived, that he could not hope either to procure pre&s;ent aid from the Prote&s;tants again&s;t the Turks, or to quiet their fears and jealou&s;ies on account of their religion. But as his &s;chemes were not yet ripe for execution, nor his prepa|rations &s;o far advanced that he could force their com|pliance, or puni&s;h their ob&s;tinacy, he artfully concealed his own intentions; and that he might augment their &s;ecurity, he appointed a Diet to be held at Rati&s;bon early next year, in order to adju&s;t what was now left un|determined; and previous to it, he agreed that a cer|tain number of divines of each party &s;hould meet, in order to confer upon the points in di&s;pute <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 351.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT how far &s;oever this appearance of a de&s;ire to maintain the pre&s;ent tranquillity might have impo&s;ed upon the Prote&s;tants, the Emperor was incapable of &s;uch uniform and thorough di&s;&s;imulation, as to hide al|together from their view the dangerous de&s;igns which he was meditating again&s;t them. Herman Count de Wied, Archbi&s;hop and Elector of Cologne, a prelate, con&s;picuous for his virtue and primitive &s;implicity of manners, though not more di&s;tingui&s;hed for learning than the other de&s;cendants of noble families, who in that age po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed mo&s;t of the great benefices in Ger|many, having become a pro&s;elyte to the doctrines of the Reformers, had begun in the year one thou&s;and five hundred and forty-three, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Melacthon and Bucer, to aboli&s;h the antient &s;uper&s;tition in his dio|ce&s;e, and to introduce in its place the rites e&s;tabli&s;hed
<PB N="41" REF="011837_0860_0F9D89D9CF377A30">
among the Prote&s;tants. But the canons of his cathedral, who were not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the &s;ame &s;pirit of innova|tion, and who fore&s;aw how fatal the levelling genius of the new &s;ect would prove to their dignity and wealth, oppo&s;ed, from the beginning, this unprecedented en|terprize of their archbi&s;hop with all the zeal flowing from reverence for old in&s;titutions, heightened by con|cern for their own intere&s;t. This oppo&s;ition, which the archbi&s;hop con&s;idered only as a new argument to de|mon&s;trate the nece&s;&s;ity of a reformation, neither &s;hook his re&s;olution nor &s;lackened his ardour in pro&s;ecuting his plan. The canons, perceiving all their endeavours to check his career to be ineffectual, &s;olemnly prote&s;ted again&s;t his proceedings, and appealed for redre&s;s to the Pope and Emperor, the former as his eccle&s;ia&s;tical, the latter as his civil &s;uperior. This appeal being laid be|fore the Emperor, during his re&s;idence in Worms, he took the canons of Cologne under his immediate pro|tection; enjoined them to proceed with rigour again&s;t all who revolted from the e&s;tabli&s;hed church; prohibit|ed the archbi&s;hop to make any innovation in his dio|ce&s;e; and &s;ummoned him to appear at Bru&s;&s;els within thirty days, to an&s;wer the accu&s;ations which &s;hould be preferred again&s;t him <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Sleid 310, 340, 351. Seckend. iii, 443, 553.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>TO this clear evidence of his ho&s;tile intentions again&s;t the Prote&s;tant party, Charles added other proofs &s;till more explicit. In his hereditary dominions of the Low-Countries, he per&s;ecuted all who were &s;u&s;pected of Lu|therani&s;m with unrelenting vigour. As &s;oon as he ar|rived at Worms, he &s;ilenced the Prote&s;tant preachers in that city. He allowed an Italian monk to inveigh again&s;t the Lutherans from the pulpit of his chapel, and to call upon him, as he regarded the favour of God, to exterminate that pe&s;tilent here&s;y. He di&s;patched the emba&s;&s;y, which has been already mentioned, to Con|&s;tantinople, with overtures of peace, that he might be free from any apprehen&s;ions of danger or interruption from that quarter. Nor did any of the&s;e &s;teps, or their dangerous tendency, e&s;cape the jealous ob&s;ervation of
<PB N="42" REF="011837_0861_0F9D89DCBAF71F90">
the Prote&s;tants, or fail to alarm their fears, and to ex|cite their &s;olicitude for the &s;afety of their &s;ect.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE Charles's good fortune which predo|minated on all occa&s;ions over that of his rival Francis, extricated him out of a difficulty, from which, with all his &s;agacity and addre&s;s, he would have found it no ea&s;y matter to have di&s;entangled him&s;elf. Ju&s;t about the time when the Duke of Orleans &s;hould have receiv|ed Ferdinand's daughter in marriage, and together with her the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Milane&s;e, he died of a pe&s;tilen|tial fever. By this event, the Emperor was freed from the nece&s;&s;ity of giving up an important province into the hands of an enemy, or from the indecency of vio|lating a recent and &s;olemn engagement, which mu&s;t have occa&s;ioned an immediate rupture with France. He affected, however, to expre&s;s great &s;orrow for the un|timely, death of a young Prince, who was to have been &s;o nearly allied to him; but he carefully avoided enter|ing into any fre&s;h di&s;cu&s;&s;ions concerning the Milane&s;e, and would not li&s;ten to a propo&s;al which came from Francis of new-modelling the treaty of Cre&s;py, &s;o as to make him &s;ome reparation for the advantages which he had lo&s;t by the demi&s;e of his &s;on. In the more active and vigorous part of Francis's reign, a declaration of war would have been the certain and in&s;tantaneous con|&s;equence of &s;uch a flat refu&s;al to comply with a demand &s;eemingly &s;o equitable; but the declining &s;tate of his own health, the exhau&s;ted condition of his kingdoms, together with the burden of the war again&s;t England, obliged him, at pre&s;ent, to di&s;&s;emble his re&s;entment, and to put off thoughts of revenge to &s;ome other juncture. In con&s;equence of this event, the unfortunate Duke of Savoy lo&s;t all hope of obtaining the re&s;titution of his territories; and the rights or claims relinqui&s;hed by the treaty of Cre&s;py, returned in full force to the crown of France, to &s;erve as pretexts for future wars <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Balcarii Comment. 769. Paruta, Hi&s;t. Venet. iv. p. 177.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>UPON the fir&s;t intelligence of the Duke of Orleans's death, the confederates of Smalkalde flattered them&s;elves that the e&s;&s;ential alterations which it occa&s;ioned could &s;carce fail of producing a rupture, which would prove
<PB N="43" REF="011837_0862_0F9D89DDE52D9400">
the means of their &s;afety. But they were not more di&s;|appointed with regard to this, than in their expectations from an event which &s;eemed to be the certain prelude of a quarrel between the Emperor and the Pope. Paul, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ion for aggrandizing his family, increa&s;ed as he advanced in years, and as he &s;aw the dignity and power which they derived immediately from him, be|coming more precarious, finding that he could not bring the Emperor to approve of his ambitious &s;chemes, ven|tured, though at the ri&s;que of incurring his di&s;plea&s;ure, to grant his &s;on Peter Lewis the inve&s;titure of Parma and Placentia. At a time when a great part of Eu|rope inveighed openly again&s;t the corrupt manners and exorbitant power of eccle&s;ia&s;tics, and when a council was &s;ummoned to reform the di&s;orders in the church, this indecent grant of &s;uch a principality to a &s;on of who&s;e illegitimate birth the Pope ought to have been a&s;hamed, and who&s;e licentious morals all good men de|te&s;ted, gave general offence. Some cardinals in the Im|perial intere&s;t remon&s;trated again&s;t &s;uch an unbecoming alienation of the patrimony of the church; the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador would not be pre&s;ent at the &s;olemnity of his enfeofment; and the Emperor peremptorily refu&s;ed, upon pretext that the&s;e cities were part of the Milane&s;e &s;tate, to confirm the deed of inve&s;titure. But both the Emperor and Pope being intent upon one common ob|ject in Germany, &s;acrificed their particular pa&s;&s;ions to that public cau&s;e, and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the emotions of jea|lou&s;y or re&s;entment which were ri&s;ing on this occa&s;ion, that they might jointly pur&s;ue what each e&s;teemed of greater importance <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Paruta, Hi&s;t.

<P>ABOUT this time the peace of Germany was di&s;turbed by a violent but &s;hort eruption of Henry Duke of Brun&s;wick. This Prince, though &s;till &s;tript of his do|minions, which the Emperor held in &s;eque&s;tration, until his differences with the confederates of Smalkalde &s;hould be adju&s;ted, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, however, &s;o much credit in Germany, that he undertook to rai&s;e for the French King, a con&s;iderable body of troops to be employed in the war again&s;t England. The money &s;tipulated for
<PB N="44" REF="011837_0863_0F9D89DEA5E27898">
this purpo&s;e was duly advanced by Francis; the troops were levied; but Henry, in&s;tead of leading them to|wards France, &s;uddenly entered his own dominions at their head, in hopes of recovering them before any ar|my could be a&s;&s;embled to oppo&s;e him. The confede|rates were not more &s;urprized at this unexpected at|tack, than the King of France was a&s;toni&s;hed at a mean thievi&s;h fraud, &s;o unbecoming the character of a Prince. But the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e, with incredible expedi|tion, collected as many men as put a &s;top to the pro|gre&s;s of Henry's undi&s;ciplined forces, and being joined by his &s;on-in-law Maurice, and &s;ome of the troops of the Elector of Saxony, he gained &s;uch advantages over Henry, who was ra&s;h and bold in forming his &s;chemes, but feeble and undetermined in executing them, as obliged him to di&s;band his army, and to &s;urrender him|&s;elf, together with his elde&s;t &s;on, pri&s;oners at di&s;cretion. He was kept in clo&s;e confinement, until a new rever&s;e of affairs procured him liberty <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 352. Seck. iii. 567.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AS this defeat of Henry's wild enterprize added new reputation to the arms of the Prote&s;tants, the reforma|tion of the Palatinate brought a great acce&s;&s;ion of &s;trength to their party. Frederick, who &s;ucceeded his brother Lewis in that Electorate, had long been &s;u&s;pect|ed of a &s;ecret propen&s;ity to the doctrines of the Re|formers, which, upon his acce&s;&s;ion to the principality, he openly manife&s;ted. But as he expected that &s;ome|thing effectual towards a general and legal e&s;tabli&s;hment of religion would be the fruit of &s;o many Diets, confe|rences, and negociations, he did not at fir&s;t attempt any public innovation in his dominions. Finding all the&s;e i&s;&s;ue in nothing, he thought him&s;elf called, at length, to countenance by his authority the &s;y&s;tem which he ap|proved of, and to gratify the wi&s;hes of his &s;ubjects, who by their intercour&s;e with the Prote&s;tant &s;tates had uni|ver&s;ally imbibed their opinions. As the warmth and impetuo&s;ity which accompanied the &s;pirit of Reforma|tion in its fir&s;t efforts had &s;omewhat abated, this change was made with great order and regularity; the antient rights were aboli&s;hed, and new forms introduced with|out
<PB N="45" REF="011837_0864_0F9D89DF203A36B0">
any act of violence, or &s;ymptom of di&s;content. Though Frederick adopted the religious &s;y&s;tem of the Prote&s;tants, he imitated the example of Maurice, and did not accede to the league of Smalkalde <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 356. Seck. l. iii. 616.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A FEW weeks before this revolution in the Palatinate, the general council was opened with the accu&s;tomed &s;o|lemnities at Trent. The eyes of the Catholic &s;tates were turned with much expectation towards an a&s;&s;em|bly, which all had con&s;idered as a natural and adequate remedy for the di&s;orders of the church when they fir&s;t broke out, though many were afraid that it was now too late to hope for great benefit from it, when the malady, by being &s;uffered to make progre&s;s during twenty-eight years, had become inveterate, and grown to &s;uch ex|treme violence. The Pope, by his la&s;t bull of convo|cation, had appointed the fir&s;t meeting to be held in March. But his views and tho&s;e of the Emperor were &s;o different, that almo&s;t the whole year was &s;pent in ne|gotiations. Charles, who fore&s;aw that the rigorous de|crees of the council again&s;t the Prote&s;tants would &s;oon drive them, in &s;elf-defence, as well as from re&s;entment, to &s;ome de&s;perate extreme, laboured to put off its meet|ing until his warlike preparations were &s;o far advanced that he might be in a condition to &s;econd its deci&s;ions by the force of his arms. The Pope, who had early &s;ent to Trent the legates who were to pre&s;ide in his name, knowing to what contempt it would expo&s;e his autho|rity, and what &s;u&s;picions it would beget of his intentions, if the fathers of the council &s;hould remain in a &s;tate of inactivity, when the church was in &s;uch danger as to re|quire their immediate and vigorous interpo&s;ition, in&s;i&s;ted either upon tran&s;lating the council to &s;ome city in Italy, or upon &s;u&s;pending its proceedings at that juncture, or upon authori&s;ing it to begin its deliberations immedi|ately. The Emperor rejected the two former as equally offen&s;ive to the Germans of every denomination; but finding it impo&s;&s;ible to elude the latter, he propo&s;ed that the council &s;hould begin with reforming the di&s;orders in the church, before it proceeded to examine or define ar|ticles of faith. This was the very thing which the court
<PB N="46" REF="011837_0865_0F9D89DFD8D27E00">
of Rome dreaded mo&s;t, and which had prompted it to employ &s;o many artifices, in order to prevent the meet|ing of &s;uch a dangerous judicatory. Paul, though more compliant than &s;ome of his predece&s;&s;ors with regard to calling a council, was no le&s;s jealous than they had been of its juri&s;diction, and &s;aw what matter of triumph &s;uch a method of proceeding would afford the heretics. He apprehended con&s;equences not only humbling, but fatal to the papal &s;ee, if the council came to con&s;ider an in|que&s;t into abu&s;es as their only bu&s;ine&s;s; or if inferior prelates were allowed to gratify their own envy and peevi&s;hne&s;s, by pre&s;cribing rules to tho&s;e who were ex|alted above them in dignity and power. Without li&s;tening, therefore, to this in&s;idious propo&s;al of the Em|peror, he in&s;tructed his legates to open the council.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion was &s;pent in matters of form. In a &s;ub&s;equent one, it was agreed that the framing of a con|fe&s;&s;ion of faith, containing all the articles which the church required its members to believe, ought to be the fir&s;t and principal bu&s;ine&s;s of the council; but that, at the &s;ame time, it &s;hould give attention to what was nece&s;&s;ary towards the reformation of manners and di&s;ci|pline. From this fir&s;t &s;ymptom of the &s;pirit with which the council was animated, from the high tone of autho|rity which the legates who pre&s;ided in it a&s;&s;umed, and from the implicit deference with which mo&s;t of the members followed their directions, the Prote&s;tants con|jectured with ea&s;e what deci&s;ions they might expect. It a&s;toni&s;hed them, however, to &s;ee forty prelates, (for no greater number was yet a&s;&s;embled) a&s;&s;ume authority as repre&s;entatives of the univer&s;al church, and proceed to determine the mo&s;t important points of doctrine in its name. Sen&s;ible of this indecency, as well as of the ri|dicule with which it might be attended, the council ad|vanced &s;lowly in its deliberations, and all its proceed|ings were for &s;ome time langui&s;hing and feeble <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">F.

As &s;oon as the confederates of Smalkalde received informa|tion of the opening of the council, they publi&s;hed a long manife&s;to, containing a renewal of their prote&s;t again&s;t its meeting, together with the rea&s;ons which in|duced

<P>THE Prote&s;tants, as they were not inattentive or un|concerned &s;pectators of their motions, entertained every day more violent &s;u&s;picions of their intentions, and re|ceived intelligence from different quarters of the machi|nations carrying on again&s;t them. The King of Eng|land informed them, that the Emperor having long re|&s;olved to exterminate their opinions, would not fail to employ this interval of tranquillity which he now en|joyed, as the mo&s;t favourable juncture for carrying his de&s;ign into execution. The merchants of Aug&s;burg, which was at that time a city of exten&s;ive trade, received advice by means of their corre&s;pondents in Italy, among whom were &s;ome who &s;ecretly favoured the Prote&s;tant cau&s;e <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Seck. l. iii. 579.</NOTE>, that a dangerous confederacy again&s;t it was forming between the Pope and Emperor. In confirma|tion of this, they heard from the Low-Countries that Charles had i&s;&s;ued orders, though with every precaution which could keep the mea&s;ure concealed, for rai&s;ing troops both there and in other parts of his dominions. Such a variety of information, corroborating with all that their own jealou&s;y or ob&s;ervation led them to appre|hend, left the Prote&s;tants little rea&s;on to doubt of the Emperor's ho&s;tile intentions. Under this impre&s;&s;ion, the deputies of the confederates of Smalkalde a&s;&s;embled at Frankfort, and by communicating their intelligence and &s;entiments to each other, reciprocally heightened their &s;en&s;e of the impending danger. But their union was not &s;uch as their &s;ituation required, or the prepa|rations of their enemies rendered nece&s;&s;ary. Their league had now &s;ub&s;i&s;ted ten years. Among &s;o many members who&s;e territories were intermingled with each other, and who, according to the cu&s;tom of Germany, had created an infinite variety of mutual rights and claims by intermarriages, alliances, and contracts of different kinds, &s;ubjects of jealou&s;y and di&s;cord had un|avoidably

ari&s;en. Some of the confederates, being con|nected with the Duke of Brun&s;wick, were highly di&s;|gu&s;ted with the Landgrave, on account of the rigour with which he had treated that ra&s;h but unfortunate Prince. Others taxed the Elector of Saxony and Land|grave, the heads of the league, with having involved the members in unnece&s;&s;ary and exorbitant expences by their profu&s;ene&s;s or want of oeconomy. The views, likewi&s;e, of the&s;e two great Princes, who, by their &s;u|perior power and authority, influenced and directed the whole body, being extremely different, rendered all its motions languid, at a time when the utmo&s;t vigour and di&s;patch were requi&s;ite. The Landgrave, of a violent and enterprizing temper, but not forgetful, amid&s;t his zeal for religion, of the u&s;ual maxims of human policy, in&s;i&s;ted that the danger which threatened them, being manife&s;t and unavoidable, they &s;hould have recour&s;e to the mo&s;t effectual expedient for &s;ecuring their own &s;afe|ty, by courting the protection of the Kings of France and England, or by joining in alliance with the Prote|&s;tant cantons of Switzerland, from whom they might expect &s;uch powerful and pre&s;ent a&s;&s;i&s;tance as their &s;itua|tion demanded. The Elector, on the other hand, with the mo&s;t upright intentions of any Prince in that age, and with talents which might have qualified him abun|dantly for the admini&s;tration of government in any tranquil period, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with &s;uch &s;uper&s;titious veneration for all the parts of the Lutheran &s;y&s;tem, and &s;uch bigotted attachment to all its tenets, as made him aver&s;e to an union with tho&s;e who differed from him in any article of faith, and rendered him very incapable of undertaking its defence in times of difficulty and dan|ger. He &s;eemed to think, that the concerns of religion were to be regulated entirely by principles and maxims different from tho&s;e which apply to the common affairs of life; and being &s;wayed too much by the opinions of Luther, who was not only a &s;tranger to the rules of po|litical conduct, but de&s;pi&s;ed them; he often di&s;covered an uncomplying &s;pirit, which proved of the greate&s;t de|triment to the cau&s;e that he wi&s;hed to &s;upport. Influ|enced, on this occa&s;ion, by the &s;evere and rigid notions of that reformer, he refu&s;ed to enter into any confede|racy

with Francis, becau&s;e he was a per&s;ecutor of the truth; or to &s;olicit the friend&s;hip of Henry, becau&s;e he was no le&s;s impious and profane than the Pope him&s;elf; or even to join in alliance with the Swi&s;s, becau&s;e they dif|fered from him in &s;everal e&s;&s;ential articles of faith. This di&s;&s;en&s;ion, about a point of &s;uch con&s;equence, produced its natural effects. Each &s;ecretly cen&s;ured and reproach|ed the other. The Landgrave con&s;idered the Elector as fettered by narrow prejudices, unworthy of a Prince called to act a chief part in a &s;cene of &s;uch importance. The Elector &s;u&s;pected him of loo&s;e principles and ambi|tious views, which corre&s;ponded ill with the &s;acred cau&s;e in which they were engaged. But though the Elector's &s;cruples prevented their timely application for foreign aid; and the jealou&s;y or di&s;content of the other Princes defeated a propo&s;al for renewing their original confe|deracy, the term during which it was to continue in force being on the point of expiring; yet the &s;en&s;e of their common danger induced them to agree with regard to other points; particularly that they would never ac|knowledge the a&s;&s;embly at Trent as a lawful council, nor &s;uffer the archbi&s;hop of Cologne to be oppre&s;&s;ed on account of the &s;teps which he had taken towards the re|formation of his dioce&s;e <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Seck. l. iii. 566, 570, 613.

<P>THE Landgrave, meanwhile, de&s;irous of penetrat|ing to the bottom of the Emperor's intentions, wrote to Granvelle, whom he knew to be thoroughly acquainted with all his ma&s;ter's &s;chemes, informing him of the &s;everal particulars which rai&s;ed the &s;u&s;picions of the Prote&s;tants, and begging an explicit declaration of what they had to fear or to hope.

<P>BUT the Emperor's actions did not corre&s;pond with the&s;e profe&s;&s;ions. For, in&s;tead of appointing men of

known moderation and a pacific temper, to appear in defence of the Catholic doctrines, at the conference which had been agreed on, he made choice of fierce bi|gots, attached to their own &s;y&s;tem with a blind ob&s;tina|cy, which rendered all hope of reconcilement de&s;perate. Malvenda, a Spani&s;h divine, who took the conduct of the debate on the part of the Catholics, managed it with all the &s;ubtle dexterity of a &s;chola&s;tic metaphy&s;ician, more &s;tudious to perplex his adver&s;aries, than to con|vince them, and more intent on palliating error than on di&s;covering truth.

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE REIGN OF THE EMPEROR CHARLES V. BOOK VIII.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE appearances of danger daily encrea&s;ed, and the tempe&s;t which had been &s;o long a gathering was ready to break forth in all its violence again&s;t the Prote&s;tant church, Luther was &s;aved, by a &s;ea&s;on|able death, from feeling or beholding its de&s;tructive rage. Having gone, though in a declining &s;tate of health, and during a rigorous &s;ea&s;on, to his native city of Ey&s;leben, in order to compo&s;e, by his authority, a di&s;&s;en&s;ion among the Counts of Mansfield, he was &s;eized with a violent inflammation in his &s;tomach, which in a few days put an end to his life, in the &s;ixty-third year of his age. As he was rai&s;ed up by Providence to be the author of one of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t intere&s;ting re|volutions recorded in hi&s;tory, there is not any per&s;on perhaps who&s;e character has been drawn with &s;uch oppo|&s;ite colours. In his own age, one party, &s;truck with horror, and inflamed with rage, when they &s;aw with what a daring hand he overturned every thing which they held to be &s;acred, or valued as beneficial, imputed to him not only all the defects and vices of a man, but the qualities of a daemon. The other, warmed with admi|ration and gratitude, which they thought he merited as
<PB N="52" REF="011837_0871_0F9D89E4B2D62518">
the re&s;torer of light and liberty to the Chri&s;tian church, a&s;cribed to him perfections above the condition of hu|manity, and viewed all his actions with a veneration bordering on that which &s;hould be paid only to tho&s;e who are guided by the immediate in&s;piration of heaven. It is his own conduct, not the undi&s;tingui&s;hing cen&s;ure, or the exaggerated prai&s;e of his contemporaries, which ought to regulate the opinions of the pre&s;ent age concerning him. Zeal for what he regarded as truth, undaunted intrepidity to maintain it, abilities both natural and ac|quired to defend it, and unwearied indu&s;try to propa|gate it, are virtues which &s;hine &s;o con&s;picuou&s;ly in eve|ry part of his behaviour, that even his enemies mu&s;t allow him to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them in an eminent degree. To the&s;e may be added with equal ju&s;tice, &s;uch purity and even au&s;terity of manners, as became one who a&s;|&s;umed the character of a Reformer; &s;uch &s;anctity of life as &s;uited the doctrine which he delivered; and &s;uch perfect di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s as affords no &s;light pre&s;ump|tion of his &s;incerity. Superior to all &s;elfi&s;h con&s;idera|tions, a &s;tranger to the elegancies of life, and de&s;pi&s;ing its plea&s;ures, he left the honours and emoluments of the church to his di&s;ciples, remaining &s;atisfied him&s;elf in his original &s;tate of profe&s;&s;or in the Univer&s;ity, and pa&s;tor of the town of Wittemberg, with the moderate appointments annexed to the&s;e offices. His extraordi|nary qualities were allayed with no incon&s;iderable mix|ture of human frailty and human pa&s;&s;ions. The&s;e, how|ever, were of &s;uch a nature, that they cannot be im|puted to malevolence or corruption of heart, but &s;eem to have taken their ri&s;e from the &s;ame &s;ource with ma|ny of his virtues, his mind forcible and vehement in all its operations, rouzed by great objects, or agitated by violent pa&s;&s;ions, broke out, on many occa&s;ions, with an impetuo&s;ity which a&s;toni&s;hes men of feebler &s;pirits, or &s;uch as are placed in a more tranquil &s;ituation. By carrying &s;ome prai&s;e-worthy di&s;po&s;itions to exce&s;s, he bordered &s;ometimes on what was culpable, and was of|ten betrayed into actions which expo&s;ed him to cen&s;ure. His confidence that his own opinions were well founded, approached to arrogance; his courage in a&s;&s;erting them, to ra&s;hne&s;s; his firmne&s;s in adhering to them, to ob&s;tinacy;
<PB N="53" REF="011837_0872_0F9D89E50C337D48">
and his zeal in confuting his adver&s;aries, to rage and &s;currility. Accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to con&s;ider every thing as &s;ubordinate to truth, he expected the &s;ame deference for it from other men; and without making any allow|ances for their timidity or prejudices, he poured forth again&s;t tho&s;e, who di&s;appointed him in this particular, a torrent of invective mingled with contempt. Regard|le&s;s of any di&s;tinction of rank or character when his doc|trines were attacked, he cha&s;ti&s;ed all his adver&s;aries, in|di&s;criminately, with the &s;ame rough hand; neither the royal dignity of Henry VIII. nor the eminent learning and abilities of Era&s;mus, &s;creened them from the &s;ame gro&s;s abu&s;e with which he treated Tetzel or Eccius.</P>
<P>BUT the&s;e indecencies of which Luther was guilty, mu&s;t not be imputed wholly to the violence of his tem|per. They ought to be charged, in part, on the man|ners of the age. Among a rude people, unacquainted with tho&s;e maxims, which, by putting continual re|&s;traints on the pa&s;&s;ions of individuals, have poli&s;hed &s;o|ciety, and rendered it agreeable, di&s;putes of every kind were managed with heat, and &s;trong emotions were ut|tered in their natural language, without re&s;erve or de|licacy. At the &s;ame time, the works of learned men were all compo&s;ed in Latin, and they were not only au|thorized, by the example of eminent writers in that language to u&s;e their antagoni&s;ts with the mo&s;t illiberal &s;currility; but in a dead tongue indecencies of every kind appear le&s;s &s;hocking than in a living language, who&s;e idioms and phra&s;es &s;eem gro&s;s, becau&s;e they are familiar.</P>
<P>IN pa&s;&s;ing judgment upon the characters of men, we ought to try them by the principles and maxims of their own age, not by tho&s;e of another. For, although vir|tue and vice are at all times the &s;ame, manners and cu&s;toms vary continually. Some parts of Luther's be|haviour, which to us appear mo&s;t culpable, gave no di&s;gu&s;t to his contemporaries. It was even by &s;ome of tho&s;e qualities, which we are now apt to blame, that he was fitted for accompli&s;hing the great work which he undertook. To rouze mankind, when &s;unk in igno|rance or &s;uper&s;tition, and to encounter the rage of bi|gotry, armed with power, required the utmo&s;t vehe|mence

of zeal, and a temper daring to exce&s;s. A gentle call would neither have reached, nor have excited tho&s;e to whom it was addre&s;&s;ed. A &s;pirit, more amiable, but le&s;s vigorous than Luther's, would have &s;hrunk back from the dangers which he braved and &s;urmounted. Towards the clo&s;e of Luther's life, though without any perceptible declen&s;ion of his zeal or abilities, the infir|mities of his temper increa&s;ed upon him, &s;o that he grew daily more peevi&s;h, more ira&s;cible, and more impatient of contradiction. Having lived to be witne&s;s of his own amazing &s;ucce&s;s; to &s;ee a great part of Europe em|brace his doctrines; and to &s;hake the foundation of the papal throne, before which the mightie&s;t Monarchs had trembled, he di&s;covered, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, &s;ymptoms of vanity and &s;elf-applau&s;e.

<P>THE Emperor, meanwhile, pur&s;ued the plan of di&s;|&s;imulation with which he had &s;et out, employing every art to amu&s;e the Prote&s;tants, and to quiet their fears and jealou&s;ies. For this purpo&s;e he contrived to have an interview with the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e, the mo&s;t ac|tive of all the confederates, and the mo&s;t &s;u&s;picious of his de&s;igns. To him he made &s;uch warm profe&s;&s;ions of his concern for the happine&s;s of Germany, and of his aver&s;ion to all violent mea&s;ures; he denied, in &s;uch ex|pre&s;s terms, his having entered into any league, or hav|ing begun any military preparations which &s;hould give cau&s;e of alarm to the Prote&s;tants, as &s;eem to have di&s;|pelled all the Landgrave's doubts and apprehen&s;ions, and &s;ent him away fully &s;atisfied of his pacific inten|tions. This artifice was of great advantage, and effec|tually an&s;wered the purpo&s;e for which it was intended. The Landgrave upon his leaving Spires, where he had been admitted to this interview, went to Worms, where the Smalkaldic confederates were a&s;&s;embled, and gave them &s;uch a flattering repre&s;entation of the Emperor's favourable di&s;po&s;ition towards them, that they, too apt, as well from the temper of the German nation, as from the genius of all great a&s;&s;ociations or bodies of men, to be &s;low and dilatory, and undeci&s;ive in their delibera|tions, thought there was no nece&s;&s;ity of taking any im|mediate mea&s;ures again&s;t danger, which appeared to be di&s;tant or imaginary <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Sleid.

The council of Trent, though &s;till compo&s;ed of a &s;mall number of Italian and Spani&s;h pre|lates, without a &s;ingle deputy from many of the king|doms which it a&s;&s;umed the right of binding by its de|crees, being a&s;hamed of its long inactivity, proceeded now to &s;ettle articles of the greate&s;t importance. Hav|ing begun with examining the fir&s;t and chief point in controver&s;y between the church of Rome and the Re|formers, concerning the rule which &s;hould be held &s;u|preme, or deci&s;ive, in matters of faith, the council, by its infallible authority, determined, "That the books to which the de&s;ignation of <HI>Apocryphal</HI> hath been given, are of equal authority with tho&s;e which were received by the Jews and primitive Chri&s;tians into the &s;acred canon; that the traditions handed down from the apo&s;tolic age, and pre&s;erved in the church, are intitled to as much re|gard as the doctrines and precepts which the in&s;pired authors have committed to writing; that the Latin tran&s;lation of the Scriptures, made or revi&s;ed by St. Je|rome, and known by the name of the <HI>Vulgate</HI> tran&s;lation, &s;hould be read in churches, and appealed to in the &s;chools as authentic and canonical." Again&s;t all who di&s;|claimed the truth of the&s;e tenets, anathemas were de|nounced in the name and by the authority of the Holy Gho&s;t.

As no per&s;on appeared in behalf of the archbi&s;hop, he was held to be convicted of the crime of here&s;y, and a papal bull was i&s;&s;ued, depriving him of his eccle&s;ia&s;tical dignity, inflicting on him the &s;entence of excommunication, and ab&s;olving his &s;ubjects from the oath of allegiance which they had taken to him as their civil &s;uperior. The countenance which he had given to the Lutheran here&s;y was the only crime im|puted to him, as well as the only rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned to ju&s;tify the extraordinary rigour of this decree. The Prote&s;tants could &s;carce believe that Paul, how zealous &s;oever to defend the e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;y&s;tem, or to humble tho&s;e who invaded it, would have ventured to proceed to &s;uch extremities again&s;t a Prince and Elector of the empire, without having previou&s;ly &s;ecured &s;uch power|ful protection as would render his cen&s;ure &s;omething more than an impotent and de&s;picable &s;ally of re&s;ent|ment. They were of cour&s;e deeply alarmed at this &s;en|tence again&s;t the archbi&s;hop, con&s;idering it as a &s;ure in|dication of the malevolent intentions not only of the Pope, but of the Emperor, again&s;t the whole party <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 354 F.

<P>UPON this fre&s;h revival of their fears, with &s;uch vio|lence as is natural to men rouzed from a fal&s;e &s;ecurity, and con&s;cious of their having been deceived, Charles &s;aw that it was now nece&s;&s;ary to throw a&s;ide the veil, and to declare openly what part he determined to act. By a long &s;eries of artifice and fallacy, he had gained &s;o much time, that his mea&s;ures, though not altogether ripe for execution, were greatly matured. The Pope, by his proceedings again&s;t the Elector of Cologne, as well as by the decree of the council, had precipitated matters into &s;uch a &s;ituation, as rendered a breach between the Emperor and the Prote&s;tants almo&s;t unavoidable. Charles had no choice left him, but either to take part with them in overturning what the &s;ee of Rome had deter|mined, or to &s;upport the authority of the church openly by force of arms. Nor did the Pope think it enough to have brought the Emperor under a nece&s;&s;ity of act|ing; he pre&s;&s;ed him to begin his operations, by pro|mi&s;ing

to &s;econd him with &s;uch vigour, as could &s;carce fail of &s;ecuring his &s;ucce&s;s. Tran&s;ported by his zeal again&s;t here&s;y, he forgot all the prudent and cautious maxims of the papal &s;ee, with regard to the danger of extending the Imperial authority beyond due bounds, and in order to cru&s;h the Lutherans, he was willing to contribute towards rai&s;ing up a ma&s;ter that might prove formidable to him&s;elf as well as to the re&s;t of Italy.</P>
<P>BUT be&s;ides the certain expectation of a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the Pope, Charles was now &s;ecure from any danger of interruption to his de&s;igns by the Turki&s;h arms. His negociations at the Porte, which he had carried on with great a&s;&s;iduity &s;ince the peace of Cre&s;py, were on the point of being terminated in &s;uch a manner as he de|&s;ired. Solyman, partly in compliance with the French King, who, in order to avoid the di&s;agreeable obligation of joining the Emperor again&s;t his antient ally, labour|ed with great zeal to bring about an accommodation between them; and partly from its being nece&s;&s;ary to turn his arms towards the ea&s;t, where the Per&s;ians threatened to invade his dominions, con&s;ented without difficulty to a truce for five years. The chief article of it was, that each &s;hould retain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what he now held in Hungary; and Ferdinand, as a &s;acrifice to the pride of the Sultan, &s;ubmitted to pay an annual tribute of fifty thou&s;and crowns <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">I&s;tuanhaffii Hi&s;t. Hung. 180. Mem. de Ribier. tom. i. 582.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT it was upon the aid and concurrence of the Ger|mans them&s;elves that the Emperor relied with the greate&s;t confidence. The Germanic body, he knew, was of &s;uch va&s;t &s;trength, as to be invincible if it were united, and that it was only by employing its own force that he could hope to &s;ubdue it. Happily for him, the union of the &s;everal members in this great &s;y&s;tem was &s;o feeble, the whole frame was &s;o loo&s;ely compacted, and its different parts tended &s;o violently towards &s;epa|ration from each other, that it was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for it, on any important emergence, to join in a general or vigorous effort. In the pre&s;ent juncture, the &s;ources of di&s;cord were as many, and as various as had been known
<PB N="59" REF="011837_0878_0F9D89EA02B471A0">
on any occa&s;ion. The Roman Catholics, animated with a zeal in defence of their religion proportional to the fiercene&s;s with which it had been attacked, were eager to &s;econd any attempt to humble tho&s;e innovators, who had overturned it in many provinces, and endangered it in more. John and Albert of Brandenburgh, as well as &s;everal other Princes, incen&s;ed at the haughtine&s;s and rigour with which the Duke of Brun&s;wick had been treated by the confederates of Smalkalde, were impatient to re&s;cue him, and to be revenged on them. Charles ob|&s;erved, with &s;atisfaction, the working of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions in their minds, and counting on them as &s;ure auxiliaries whenever he &s;hould think it proper to act, he found it, meanwhile, more nece&s;&s;ary to moderate than to inflame their rage.</P>
<P>SUCH was the &s;ituation of affairs, &s;uch the di&s;cern|ment with which the Emperor fore&s;aw and provided for every event, when the Diet of the empire met at Ra|ti&s;bon. Many of the Roman Catholic members ap|peared there in per&s;on, but mo&s;t of the confederates of Smalkalde, under pretence of their being unable to bear the expence occa&s;ioned by the late unnece&s;&s;ary frequen|cy of &s;uch a&s;&s;emblies, &s;ent only deputies. Their jea|lou&s;y of the Emperor, and apprehen&s;ions that violence, perhaps, might be employed in order to force their ap|probation of what he &s;hould propo&s;e in the Diet, was the true cau&s;e of their ab&s;ence. The &s;peech with which the Emperor opened the Diet was extremely artful. After profe&s;&s;ing, in common form, his regard for the pro&s;perity of the Germanic body, and declaring, that in order to be&s;tow his whole attention upon the re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of its order and tranquillity, he had at pre&s;ent abandoned all other cares, rejected the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing &s;o|licitations of his other &s;ubjects to re&s;ide among them, and po&s;tponed affairs of the greate&s;t importance; he took notice, with &s;ome indignation, that his di&s;intere&s;ted example had not been imitated; many members of chief con&s;ideration having neglected to attend an a&s;&s;em|bly to which he had repaired with &s;uch manife&s;t incon|venience to him&s;elf. He then mentioned their unhap|py di&s;&s;en&s;ions about religion; lamented the ill &s;ucce&s;s
<PB N="60" REF="011837_0879_0F9D89EA84D6D0B8">
of his pa&s;t endeavours to compo&s;e them; complained of the abrupt di&s;&s;olution of the late conference, and craved their advice with regard to the be&s;t and mo&s;t ef|fectual method of re&s;toring union to the churches of Germany, together with that happy agreement in ar|ticles of faith, which their ance&s;tors had found to be of no le&s;s advantage to their civil intere&s;t, than becoming their Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>BY this gracious and popular method of con&s;ulting the members of the Diet, rather than of obtruding upon them any opinion of his own, be&s;ides the appearance of great moderation, and the merit of paying much re&s;pect to their judgment, the Emperor dextrou&s;ly avoided di&s;|covering his own &s;entiments, and re&s;erved to him&s;elf, as his only part, that of carrying into execution what they &s;hould recommend. Nor was he le&s;s &s;ecure of &s;uch a deci&s;ion as he wi&s;hed for by referring it wholly to them&s;elves. The Roman Catholic members, prompt|ed by their own zeal, or prepared by his intrigues, joined immediately in repre&s;enting that the authority of the council, now met at Trent, ought to be final in all matters of controver&s;y; that all Chri&s;tians &s;hould &s;ub|mit to its decrees as the infallible rule of their faith; and therefore they be&s;ought him to exert the power with which he was inve&s;ted by the Almighty, in protecting that a&s;&s;embly, and in compelling the Prote&s;tants to ac|quie&s;ce in its determinations. The Prote&s;tants, on the other hand, pre&s;ented a memorial, in which, after re|peating their objections to the council of Trent, they propo&s;ed, as the only effectual method of deciding the points in di&s;pute, that either a free general council &s;hould be a&s;&s;embled in Germany, or a national council of the empire &s;hould be called, or a &s;elect number of divines &s;hould be appointed out of each party to exa|mine and define articles of faith; they mentioned the rece&s;&s;es of &s;everal Diets favourable to this propo&s;ition, and which gave them hope of terminating all their dif|ferences in this amicable manner; they now conjured the Emperor not to depart from his former plan, and by offering violence to their con&s;ciences to bring calamities upon Germany, the very thought of which mu&s;t fill every lover of his country with horror. The Emperor

receiving this paper with a contemptuous &s;mile, paid no farther regard to it. Having already taken his final re|&s;olution, and perceiving that nothing but force could compel them to acquie&s;ce in it, he di&s;patched the Cardi|nal of Trent to Rome, in order to conclude an alliance with the Pope, the terms of which were already agreed on; he commanded a body of troops, levied on pur|po&s;e in the Low-Countries, to advance towards Germa|ny; he gave commi&s;&s;ions to &s;everal officers for rai&s;ing men in different parts of the empire; he warned John and Albert of Brandenburgh, that now was the proper time of exerting them&s;elves, in order to re&s;cue their al|ly, Henry of Brun&s;wick, from captivity <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 374.

<P>ALL the&s;e things could not be tran&s;acted without the ob&s;ervation and knowledge of the Prote&s;tants. The &s;e|cret was now in many hands; under whatever veil of ar|tifice, or &s;ecrecy, the Emperor &s;till affected to conceal his de&s;igns, his officers kept no &s;uch my&s;terious re&s;erve, and his allies and &s;ubjects &s;poke out his intentions plain|ly. Alarmed with reports of this kind, from every quarter, as well as with the preparations of war which they &s;aw begun, the deputies of the confederates de|manded audience of the Emperor, and in the name of their ma&s;ters, required to know whether the&s;e military preparations were carried on by his command, and for what end, and again&s;t what enemy. To a que&s;tion put in &s;uch a tone, and at a time when facts were become too notorious to be denied, it was nece&s;&s;ary to give an explicit an&s;wer. He owned the orders which he had i&s;|&s;ued, and profe&s;&s;ing his purpo&s;e not to mole&s;t any on account of religion who &s;hould act as dutiful &s;ubjects, declared that he had nothing in view but to maintain the rights and prerogatives of the Imperial dignity, and by puni&s;hing &s;ome factious members to pre&s;erve the antient con&s;titution of the empire from being impaired or di&s;|&s;olved by their irregular or licentious conduct. Though the Emperor did not name the per&s;ons whom he charg|ed with &s;uch high crimes, and de&s;tined to be the objects of his vengeance, it was obvious that he had the Elec|tor of Saxony and Landgrave of He&s;&s;e in view. Their

deputies, con&s;idering what he had &s;aid, as a plain de|claration of his ho&s;tile intentions, immediately retired from Rati&s;bon <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 376.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Cardinal of Trent found it no difficult matter to treat with the Pope, who having at length brought the Emperor to adopt that plan which he had long re|commended, a&s;&s;ented with eagerne&s;s to every article that he propo&s;ed. The league was &s;igned a few days after the Cardinal's arrival at Rome. The pernicious here&s;ies which abounded in Germany, the ob&s;tinacy of the Prote&s;tants in rejecting the holy council a&s;&s;embled at Trent, and the nece&s;&s;ity of maintaining &s;ound doc|trine, together with good order in the church, are men|tioned as the motives of this union between the con|tracting parties. In order to check the growth of the&s;e evils, and to puni&s;h &s;uch as had impiou&s;ly contributed to &s;pread them, the Emperor, having long and without &s;ucce&s;s made trial of gentler remedies, engaged in&s;tant|ly to take the field with a &s;ufficient army, that he might compel by force all who di&s;owned the council, or had apo&s;tatized from the religion of their forefathers, to re|turn into the bo&s;om of the church, and to &s;ubmit with due obedience to the holy &s;ee. He likewi&s;e bound him&s;elf not to conclude a peace with them during &s;ix months without the Pope's con&s;ent, nor without a&s;&s;ign|ing him his &s;hare in any conque&s;t which &s;hould be made upon them; and that even after that period he &s;hould not agree to any accommodation which might be detri|mental to the church, or the intere&s;t of religion. On his part, the Pope &s;tipulated to depo&s;it a large &s;um in the bank of Venice&punc; towards defraying the expence of the war; to maintain at his own charge, during the &s;pace of &s;ix months, twelve thou&s;and foot, and five hundred hor&s;e; to grant the Emperor for one year half of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues throughout Spain; to authorize him by a bull to alienate as much of the lands belonging to religious hou&s;es in that country, as would amount to the &s;um of five hundred thou&s;and crowns; and to em|ploy not only &s;piritual cen&s;ures, but military force

again&s;t any Prince who &s;hould attempt to interrupt or defeat the execution of this treaty <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 381. Pallav. 255. Dumont Corps Diplom. 11.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the explicit terms in which the extirpation of here&s;y was declared to be the object of the war which was to follow upon this treaty, Charles &s;till endeavoured to per&s;uade the Germans that he had no de&s;ign to abridge their religious liberty, but that he aimed only at vindicating his own authority, and re|pre&s;&s;ing the in&s;olence of tho&s;e who had encroached upon it. With this view he wrote circular letters, in the &s;ame &s;train with his an&s;wer to the deputies at Rati&s;bon, to mo&s;t of the free cities, and to &s;everal of the Princes who had embraced the Prote&s;tant doctrines. In the&s;e he complained loudly, but in general terms, of the con|tempt into which the Imperial dignity had fallen, and of the pre&s;umptuous as well as di&s;orderly behaviour of &s;ome members of the empire. He declared he now took arms, not in a religious but in a civil quarrel; not to oppre&s;s tho&s;e who continued to behave as quiet and du|tiful &s;ubjects, but to humble the arrogance of &s;uch as had thrown off all &s;en&s;e of that &s;ubordination in which they were placed under him as head of the Germa|nic body. Gro&s;s as this deception was, and manife&s;t as it might have appeared to all who con&s;idered the Em|peror's conduct with attention, it became nece&s;&s;ary for him to make trial of its effect; and &s;uch was the confi|dence and dexterity with which he employed it, that he derived the mo&s;t &s;olid advantages from this artifice. If he had avowed at once an intention of overturning the Prote&s;tant church, and of reducing all Germany under its antient &s;tate of &s;ubjection to the papal &s;ee, none of the cities or Princes who had embraced the new opinions could have remained neutral after &s;uch a declaration, far le&s;s could they have ventured to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Empe|ror in &s;uch an enterprize. Whereas, by concealing and even di&s;claiming any intention of that kind, he not on|ly &s;aved him&s;elf from the danger of being overwhelmed by a general confederacy of all the Prote&s;tant &s;tates, but he furni&s;hed the timid with an excu&s;e for continuing in|active, and the de&s;igning or intere&s;ted with a pretext for
<PB N="64" REF="011837_0883_0F9D89EECA323AC0">
joining him without expo&s;ing them&s;elves to the infamy of abandoning their own principles, or having an active hand in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing them. At the &s;ame time, the Em|peror well knew, that if he were enabled, by their a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, to break the power of the Elector of Saxony and Landgrave, he might afterwards pre&s;cribe what terms he plea&s;ed to the feeble remains of a party without union or leaders, who would then regret, too late, their mi&s;taken confidence in him, and their incon&s;iderate de|&s;ertion of their a&s;&s;ociates.</P>
<P>THE Pope, by a &s;udden and unfore&s;een di&s;play of his zeal, had well nigh di&s;concerted this plan which the Emperor had formed with &s;o much care and art. Proud of having been the author of &s;uch a formidable confe|deracy again&s;t the Lutheran here&s;y, and happy in think|ing that the glory of extirpating it was re&s;erved for his Pontificate, he publi&s;hed the articles of his league with the Emperor as a proof of their pious intention, as well as of the extraordinary efforts which he him&s;elf was about to make for maintaining the faith in its purity. Not &s;atisfied with this, he &s;oon after i&s;&s;ued a bull con|taining mo&s;t liberal promi&s;es of indulgence to all who &s;hould engage in this holy enterprize, together with warm exhortations to &s;uch as could not bear a part in it them&s;elves, to increa&s;e the fervour of their prayers, and the &s;everity of their mortifications, that they might draw down the ble&s;&s;ing of heaven upon tho&s;e who undertook it <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Du Mont, Corps Diplom.</NOTE>. Nor was it zeal alone which pu&s;hed the Pope to make declarations &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with the account which the Emperor him&s;elf gave of his motives for taking arms. He was much &s;candalized at Charles's di&s;&s;imula|tion in &s;uch a cau&s;e; at his &s;eeming to be a&s;hamed of owning his zeal for the church; and at his endeavours to make that pa&s;s for a political conte&s;t, which he ought to have gloried in as a war which had no other object than the defence of religion. With as much &s;olicitude, therefore, as the Emperor laboured to di&s;gui&s;e the pur|po&s;e of the confederacy, did the Pope endeavour to pub|li&s;h their real plan, in order that they might come at once to a rupture with the Prote&s;tants, that all hope of
<PB N="65" REF="011837_0884_0F9D89EF96D24CE8">
reconcilement might be cut off, and that Charles might be under fewer temptations, and have it le&s;s in his power than at pre&s;ent, to betray the intere&s;ts of the church by an accommodation beneficial to him&s;elf <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">F. Paul, 188. Thuan. Hi&s;t. i. 61.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Emperor, though not a little offended at the Pope's indi&s;cretion or malice in making this di&s;covery, continued boldly to pur&s;ue his own plan, and to a&s;&s;ert his intentions to be no other than what he had originally avowed. Several of the Prote&s;tant &s;tates, whom he had previou&s;ly gained, thought them&s;elves ju&s;tified in &s;ome mea&s;ure, by his declarations, for abandoning their a&s;&s;ociates, and even for giving a&s;&s;i&s;tance to him.</P>
<P>BUT the&s;e artifices did not impo&s;e on the greater and &s;ounder part of the Prote&s;tant confederates. They clearly perceived it to be again&s;t the reformed religion that the Emperor had taken arms, and that not only the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of it, but the extinction of the German li|berties, would be the certain con&s;equence of his obtain|ing &s;uch an entire &s;uperiority as would enable him to execute his &s;chemes in their full extent. They deter|mined, therefore, to prepare for their own defence, and neither to renounce tho&s;e religious truths, to the know|ledge of which they had attained by means &s;o wonder|ful, nor to abandon tho&s;e civil rights which had been tran&s;mitted to them by their ance&s;tors. In order to give the nece&s;&s;ary directions for this purpo&s;e, their deputies met at Ulm, &s;oon after their abrupt departure from Rati&s;bon. Their deliberations were now conducted with &s;uch vigour and unanimity, as the imminent dan|ger which threatened them required. The contingent of troops, which each of the confederates was to furni&s;h having been fixed by the original treaty of union, or|ders were given for bringing them immediately into the field. Being &s;en&s;ible, at la&s;t, that through the narrow prejudices of &s;ome of their members, and the impru|dent &s;ecurity of others, they had neglected too long to &s;trengthen them&s;elves by foreign alliances, they now ap|plied with great earne&s;tne&s;s to the Venetians and Swi&s;s.</P>
<P>TO the former, they repre&s;ented the Emperor's in|tention of overturning the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of Germany,

The &s;itu|ation of the two Monarchs flattered them with hopes of &s;ucce&s;s. Ho&s;tilities between them had continued for &s;ome time after the peace of Cre&s;py. But becoming weary at la&s;t of a war, attended with no glory or advan|tage to either, they had lately terminated all their dif|ferences by a peace concluded at Campe, near Ardres. Francis having with great difficulty procured his allies, the Scots, to be included in the treaty, in return for that conce&s;&s;ion he engaged to pay a great &s;um, which Henry demanded as due to him on &s;everal accounts, and he left Bologne in the hands of the Engli&s;h as a pledge for his faithful performance of that article. But though the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of peace &s;eemed to leave the two Mo|narchs at liberty to turn their attention towards Ger|many, &s;o unfortunate were the Prote&s;tants, that they de|rived no immediate advantage from this circum&s;tance. Henry appeared unwilling to enter into any alliance with them, but on &s;uch conditions as would render him not only the head, but the &s;upreme director of their league, a pre-eminence which, as the bonds of union or intere&s;t between them were but feeble, and as he differed from them &s;o widely in his religious &s;entiments, they had no inclination to admit <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Rymer, xv. 93.

<P>BUT, notwith&s;tanding their ill &s;ucce&s;s in their negoci|ations with foreign courts, the confederates found no difficulty at home, in bringing a &s;ufficient force into the field.

Upon every op|portunity of entering into &s;ervice, they were accu&s;tomed to run eagerly to arms; and to every &s;tandard that was erected, voluntiers flocked from all quarters <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Seck. l. iii. 161.</NOTE>.

Influenced by the&s;e con&s;iderations, which happily for the peace of &s;ociety, operate powerfully on the human mind, the confederates could not think of throwing off that alle|giance which they regularly owed to the head of the empire, of turning their arms again&s;t him without one &s;olemn appeal more to his candour, and the impartial judgment of their fellow &s;ubjects. For this purpo&s;e, they addre&s;&s;ed a letter to the Emperor, and a manife&s;to to all the inhabitants of Germany. The tenor of both was the &s;ame.

The command of a con&s;iderable body of troops rai&s;ed by the city of Aug&s;burgh having been given to Se|ba&s;tian Schertel, a &s;oldier of fortune, who by the booty he had got when the Imperiali&s;ts plundered Rome, to|gether with the merit of long &s;ervice, had acquired wealth and authority, which placed him on a level with the chief of the German nobles, that gallant veteran re&s;olved before he joined the main body of the confe|rates, to attempt &s;omething &s;uitable to his former &s;ame, and to the expectation of his countrymen. As the Pope's forces were ha&s;tening towards Tyrol, in order to penetrate into Germany, by the narrow pa&s;&s;es through the mountains which run acro&s;s that country, he advan|ced thither with the utmo&s;t rapidity, and &s;eized Ehren|berg and Cuff&s;tein, two &s;trong ca&s;tles which commanded the principal defiles.

<P>NOR was the recalling of Sche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">l the only error of which the confederates were guilty. As the &s;upreme command of their army was committed, in terms of the league of Smalkalde, to the Elector of Saxony and Landgrave of He&s;&s;e with equal authority, all the incon|veniencies ari&s;ing from a divided and co-ordinate juri&s;|diction, which is always of fatal con&s;equence in the operations of war, were immediately felt. The Elector, though intrepid in his own per&s;on to exce&s;s, and mo&s;t ardently zealous in the cau&s;e was &s;low in deliberating, uncertain as well as irre&s;olute in his determinations, and con&s;tantly preferred mea&s;ures which were cautious and &s;afek, to &s;uch as were bold and deci&s;ive. The Landgrave, of a more active and enterprizing nature, formed all his re&s;olutions with promptitude, wi&s;hed to execute them with &s;pirit, and uniformly preferred &s;uch &s;chemes as tended to bring the conte&s;t to a &s;peedy i&s;&s;ue.

<P>THE Emperor, who was afraid, that by remaining <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Rati&s;bon, he would render it impo&s;&s;ible for the Pope's forces to join him, having boldly advanced to Land&s;hut on the I&s;er, the confederates lo&s;t &s;ome days in delibe|rating whether it was proper to follow him into the ter|ritories of the Duke of Bavaria, a neutral Prince. When at la&s;t they &s;urmounted that &s;cruple, and began to more towards his camp, they &s;uddenly abandoned the de&s;ign and ha&s;tened to attack Rati&s;bon, in which town Charles could leave only a &s;mall garri&s;on.

<P>THE arrival of the&s;e troops enabled the Emperor to &s;end &s;uch a reinforcement to the garri&s;on of Rati&s;bon, that the confederates relinqui&s;hing all hopes of reducing that town, marched towards Ingold&s;tadt on the Danube, near to which Charles was now encamped. Meanwhile, they exclaimed loudly again&s;t the Emperor's notorious violation of the laws and con&s;titution of the empire, in having called in foreigners to lay wa&s;te Germany, and to oppre&s;s its liberties. As in that age, the dominion of the Roman &s;ee was &s;o odious to the Prote&s;tants, that the name of the Pope was &s;ufficient to in&s;pire them with horror at any enterprize which he countenanced, and to rai&s;e in their minds the blacke&s;t &s;u&s;picions, it came to be univer&s;ally believed among them, that Paul, not &s;a|tisfied with attacking them openly by force of arms, had di&s;per&s;ed his emi&s;&s;aries all over Germany to &s;et on fire their towns and magazines, and to poi&s;on the wells and fountains of water. Nor did this rumour &s;pread only among the vulgar, being extravagant as well as fright|ful enough to make a deep impre&s;&s;ion on their credu|lity; even the leaders of the party, blinded by their pre|judices, publi&s;hed a declaration, in which they accu&s;ed the Pope of having employed the&s;e antichri&s;tian and diabolical arts again&s;t them <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 399.</NOTE>. The&s;e &s;entiments of the confederates were confirmed in &s;ome mea&s;ure, by the behaviour of the papal troops, who, thinking nothing too rigorous towards Heretics anathematized by the church, were guilty of great exce&s;&s;es in the Lutheran territories, and aggravated the calamities of war, by mingling with it all the cruelty of bigotted zeal.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="011837_0895_0F9D87E5711CD0A0">THE fir&s;t operations in the field, however, did not corre&s;pond with the violence of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which animated individuals. The Emperor had prudently taken the re&s;olution of avoiding an action with an ene|my &s;o far &s;uperior in number <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Avila, 78. a.</NOTE>, e&s;pecially as he fore&s;aw that nothing could keep a body compo&s;ed of &s;o many and &s;uch di&s;&s;imilar members from falling to pieces, but the pre&s;&s;ing to attack it with, an incon&s;iderate precipi|tancy. The confederates, though it was no le&s;s evident to them that every moment's delay was pernicious, were &s;till prevented by the weakne&s;s or divi&s;ion of their leaders from exerting that vigour, with which their &s;ituation, as well as the ardour of their &s;oldiers, ought to have in|&s;pired them. On their arrival at Ingold&s;tadt, they found the Emperor in a camp not remarkable for &s;trength, and &s;urrounded only by a &s;light entrenchment. Before the camp lay a plain of &s;uch extent, as afforded &s;uffici|ent &s;pace for drawing out their whole army, and bring|ing it to act at once. Every con&s;ideration &s;hould have determined them to have &s;eized this opportunity of at|tacking the Emperor; and their va&s;t &s;uperiority in numbers, the eagerne&s;s of their troops, together with the &s;tability of the German infantry in pitched battles, afforded them the mo&s;t probable expectation of victory. The Landgrave urged this with great warmth, declar|ing, that if the &s;ole command were ve&s;ted in him, he would terminate the war on that occa&s;ion, and decide by one general action the fate of the two parties. But the Elector reflecting on the valour and di&s;cipline of the enemies forces, animated by the pre&s;ence of the Empe|ror, and conducted by the be&s;t officers of the age, would not venture upon an action, which he thought to be &s;o doubtful, as the attacking &s;uch a body of veterans on ground which they them&s;elves had cho&s;en, and while covered by fortifications, which, though imperfect would afford them no &s;mall advantage in the combat. Not|with&s;tanding his he&s;itation and remon&s;trances, it was agreed, to advance towards the enemies camp in battle array, in order to make trial whether by that in&s;ult, and by a furious cannonade which they began, they could

draw the Imperiali&s;ts out of their works. But the Em|peror had too much &s;agacity to fall into this &s;nare. He adhered to his own &s;y&s;tem with inflexible con&s;tancy; and drawing up his &s;oldiers behind their trenches, that they might be ready to receive the confederates if they &s;hould venture upon an a&s;&s;ault, calmly waited their ap|proach, and carefully re&s;trained his own men from any excur&s;ions or &s;kirmi&s;hes that might bring on an engage|ment. Meanwhile, he rode along the lines, and ad|dre&s;&s;ing the troops of the different nations in their own language, encouraged them by the chearfulne&s;s of his voice and countenance; he expo&s;ed him&s;elf in places of the greate&s;t danger, and amid&s;t the warme&s;t fire of the enemies artillery, the mo&s;t numerous that had hi|therto been brought into the field by any army. Rouz|ed by his example, not a man quitted his ranks; it was thought infamous to di&s;cover any &s;ymptom of fear when the Emperor appeared &s;o intrepid; and the meane&s;t &s;oldier plainly perceived, that their declining the combat at pre&s;ent was not the effect of timidity in their general, but the re&s;ult of a well weighed caution. The confederates, after firing &s;everal hours on the Im|periali&s;ts, with more noi&s;e and terror than execution, &s;ee|ing no pro&s;pect of alluring them to fight on equal terms, retired to their own camp. The Emperor employed the night with &s;uch diligence in &s;trengthening his works, that the confederates, returning the cannonade next day, found that, though they had now been willing to venture upon &s;uch a bold experiment, the opportunity of making an attack with advantage was lo&s;t <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 395, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">97.

<P>AFTER &s;uch a di&s;covery, from their own feeblene&s;s and irre&s;olution, and of the prudence as well as firmne&s;s of the Emperor's conduct, the confederates turned their whole attention towards preventing the arrival of a powerful reinforcement of ten thou&s;and foot, and four thou&s;and hor&s;e, which the Count de Buren was bringing to the Emperor from the Low-Countries. But though that general had to traver&s;e &s;uch an extent of country; though his route lay through the territories of &s;everal &s;tates warmly di&s;po&s;ed to favour the confederates;

though they were apprized of his approach, and by their va&s;t &s;uperiority in numbers might ea&s;ily have detached a force &s;ufficient to overpower him, he advanced with &s;uch rapidity, and by &s;uch well concerted movements, while they oppo&s;ed him with &s;uch remi&s;&s;ne&s;s, and &s;o little military &s;kill, that he conducted this body to the Impe|rial camp without any lo&s;s <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 403.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER the arrival of the Flemings, in whom he placed great confidence, the Emperor altered, in &s;ome degree, his plan of operations, and began to act more upon the offen&s;ive, though he &s;till avoided a battle with the utmo&s;t indu&s;try. He made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Neo|burgh, Dillingen, and Donawert on the Danube; of Nordlingen, and &s;everal other towns, &s;ituated on the mo&s;t con&s;iderable &s;treams that fall into that mighty river. By this he got the command of a great extent of country, though not without being obliged to engage in &s;everal encounters, of which the &s;ucce&s;s was various, nor without the mo&s;t imminent danger oftener than once of being drawn into a battle. In this manner the whole autumn was &s;pent; neither party gained any remarkable &s;uperiority over the other, and nothing was yet done towards bringing the war to a period. The Emperor had often foretold, with confidence, that di&s;|cord and the want of money would compel the confe|derates to di&s;per&s;e that unwieldy body, which they had neither abilities to guide, nor funds to &s;upport <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Belli Smalkaldici Commentarius Graeco &s;ermone &s;criptus a Joach. Camerario ap. Freherum, vol. iii. p. 479.</NOTE>; but though he waited with impatience for the accompli&s;h|ment of his prediction, there was no pro&s;pect of that event being at hand. Meanwhile, he him&s;elf began to &s;uffer from the want of forage and provi&s;ions; even the Catholic provinces being &s;o much incen&s;ed at the intro|duction of foreigners into the empire, that they &s;upplied them with reluctance, while the camp of the confederates abounded with a profu&s;ion of nece&s;&s;aries, which the zeal of their friends in the adjacent countries furni&s;hed with the utmo&s;t liberality and good-will. Great numbers of the Italians and Spaniards, unaccu&s;tomed to the climate or food of Germany, were become unfit for &s;ervice

Con&s;iderable, arrears were now due to the troops, who had &s;carce received any money from the beginning of the campaign; the Emperor, expe|riencing on this as well as on former occa&s;ions, that his juri&s;diction was more exten&s;ive than his revenues, and that the former enabled him to a&s;&s;emble a greater num|ber of &s;oldiers, than the latter were &s;ufficient to pay. Upon all the&s;e accounts, he found it difficult to keep his army in the field; &s;ome of his able&s;t generals, and even the Duke of Alva him&s;elf, per&s;evering and ob&s;ti|nate as he u&s;ually was in the pro&s;ecution of every mea|&s;ure, advi&s;ing him to di&s;per&s;e his troops into winter-quarters. But as the arguments urged again&s;t any plan which he had adopted, rarely made much impre&s;&s;ion upon the Emperor, he paid no regard to their opinion, and determined to continue his efforts in order to weary out the confederates; being well a&s;&s;ured that if he could once oblige them to &s;eparate, their was little probability of their uniting again in a body <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Thuan. 83.</NOTE>. Still, however, it re|mained a doubtful point, whether his &s;teadine&s;s was mo&s;t likely to fail, or their zeal to be exhau&s;ted. It was &s;till uncertain which party, by fir&s;t dividing its forces, would give the &s;uperiority to the other; when an unexpected event decided the conte&s;t, and occa&s;ioned a fatal rever&s;e in the affairs of the confederates.</P>
<P>MAURICE of Saxony having, by the arts which have already been de&s;cribed, in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the Em|peror's confidence, no &s;ooner &s;aw ho&s;tilities ready to break out between him and the confederates of Smal|kalde, than va&s;t pro&s;pects of ambition began to open upon him. That portion of Saxony, which de&s;cended to him from his ance&s;tors, was far from &s;atisfying his a&s;piring mind; and he perceived with plea&s;ure the ap|proach of civil war, as amid&s;t the revolutions or con|vul&s;ions which it occa&s;ions, opportunities which at other times are &s;ought in vain, of aco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iring new power as well as additional dignity, pre&s;ent them&s;elves to an enter|prizing &s;pirit.

on which &s;ide the greate&s;t advantages were to be expected. Having revolved all the&s;e things in his own mind, and having taken his final re&s;olution at join|ing the Emperor, he prudently determined to declare early in his favour; that, by the merit of this, he might acquire a title to a proportional recompence. With the view he had repaired to Rati&s;bon in the month of May, under pretext of attending the Diet; and after many conferences with Charles or his mini&s;ters, concluded, though with the mo&s;t my&s;terious &s;ecrecy, a treaty, in which he engaged to concur in a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Emperor as a faithful &s;ubject; and Charles, in return, &s;tipulated to be&s;tow on him all the &s;poils of the Elector of Saxony, his dignities as well as territories <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Haraec.

Hi&s;tory &s;carce re|cords any treaty which can be con&s;idered as a more ma|nife&s;t violation of tho&s;e ju&s;t principles which ought to influence human actions. Maurice, a profe&s;&s;ed Pro|te&s;tant, at a time when the belief of religion, as well as zeal for its intere&s;ts, took &s;trong po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every mind, binds him&s;elf to contribute his a&s;&s;i&s;tance towards carry|ing on a war, which had manife&s;tly no other object than the extirpation of the Prote&s;tant doctrines. He engages to take arms again&s;t his father-in-law, and to &s;trip his neare&s;t relation of his honours and dominions. He joins a dubious friend again&s;t a known benefactor, to whom his obligations were both great and recent. Nor was the Prince who ventured upon all this, one of tho&s;e au|dacious politicians, who, provided they can accompli&s;h their ends, and &s;ecure their intere&s;t, di&s;regard avowedly the mo&s;t &s;acred obligations, and glory in contemning whatever is honourable or decent. Maurice's conduct, if the whole mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to policy, was more artful and ma&s;terly; he executed his plan in all its parts, and yet endeavoured to pre&s;erve, in every &s;tep which he took, the appearance of what was fair, and virtuous, and laudable. It is probable from his &s;ub&s;equent beha|viour, that with regard to the Prote&s;tant religion at lea&s;t, his intentions were upright, that he fondly tru&s;ted to the Emperor's promi&s;es for its &s;ecurity, but that, according

to the fate of all who refine too much in policy, and who tread in dark and crooked paths, in attempting to deceive others, he him&s;elf was, in &s;ome degree, deceived.</P>
<P>HIS fir&s;t care, however, was to keep the&s;e engage|ments with the Emperor clo&s;ely concealed: And &s;o per|fect a ma&s;ter was he in the art of di&s;&s;imulation, that the confederates, notwith&s;tanding his declining all connec|tions with them, and his remarkable a&s;&s;iduity in paying court to the Emperor, &s;eemed to have entertained no &s;u&s;picion of his de&s;igns. Even the Elector of Saxony, when he marched at the beginning of the campaign to join his a&s;&s;ociates, committed his dominions to his pro|tection, which Maurice, with an in&s;idious appearance of friend&s;hip, readily undertook <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Struvii Corp. 1046.</NOTE>. But &s;carce had the Elector taken the field, when Maurice began to con&s;ult privately with the King of the Romans how to invade tho&s;e very territories, with the defence of which he was entru&s;ted. Soon after, the Emperor &s;ent him a copy of the Imperial ban denounced again&s;t the Elector and Landgrave. As he was next heir to the former, and particularly intere&s;ted in preventing &s;trangers from get|ting his dominions into their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, Charles required him, not only for his own &s;ake, but upon the allegiance and duty which he owed to the head of the empire, in|&s;tantly to &s;eize and detain in his hands the forfeited e&s;tates of the Elector; warning him, at the &s;ame time, that if he neglected to obey the&s;e commands, he &s;hould be held as acce&s;&s;ary to the crimes of his kin&s;man, and be liable to the &s;ame puni&s;hment <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 391. Thuan. 84.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS artifice, which, it is probable Maurice him&s;elf &s;ugge&s;ted, was employed by him in order that his con|duct towards the Elector might &s;eem a ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">er of nece&s;|&s;ity, but not of choice, an act of obedience to his &s;u|perior, rather than a voluntary inva&s;ion of the rights of his kin&s;man and ally. But in order to give &s;ome more &s;pecious appearance to this thin veil with which he en|deavoured to cover his ambition, he had called together, &s;oon after his return from Rati&s;bon, the &s;tates of his country; and repre&s;enting to them that a civil war be|tween the Emperor and confederates of Smalkalde was

now become unavoidable, de&s;ired their advice with re|gard to the part he &s;hould act in that event. They be|ing prepared, no doubt, and tutored before-hand, as well as de&s;irous of gratifying their Prince, whom they both e&s;teemed and loved, gave &s;uch coun&s;el as they knew would be mo&s;t agreeable; advi&s;ing him to offer his mediation towards reconciling the contending par|ties; but if that were rejected, and he could obtain pro|per &s;ecurity for the Prote&s;tant religion, they delivered it as their opinion that he ought, in all other points, to yield obedience to the Emperor. Upon receiving the Imperial re&s;cript, together with the ban again&s;t the Elec|tor and Landgrave, he &s;ummoned the &s;tates of his coun|try a &s;econd time; he laid before them the orders which he had received, and the puni&s;hment with which he was threatened in ca&s;e of di&s;obedience; he acquainted them that the confederates had refu&s;ed to admit of his media|tion, and that the Emperor had given him the mo&s;t &s;a|tisfactory declarations with regard to religion; he men|tioned his own intere&s;t in &s;ecuring po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the elec|toral dominions, together with the danger of allowing &s;trangers to obtain an e&s;tabli&s;hment in Saxony; and, upon the whole, as the point under deliberation re&s;pect|ed his &s;ubjects no le&s;s than him&s;elf, he de&s;ired to know their &s;entiments how he &s;hould &s;teer in that difficult and arduous conjuncture. The &s;tates, no le&s;s ob&s;equious and complai&s;ant, than formerly, relying on the Empe|ror's promi&s;es as a perfect &s;ecurity for their religion, pro|po&s;ed, that before he had recour&s;e to more violent me|thods, they would write to the Elector, exhorting him, as the be&s;t means of appea&s;ing the Emperor, and of pre|venting his dominions from being &s;eized by foreign or ho&s;tile powers, to give his con&s;ent that Maurice &s;hould take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them quietly, and without oppo&s;ition. Maurice him&s;elf &s;econded their arguments in a letter to the Landgrave, his father-in-law. Such an extravagant propo&s;ition was rejected with the &s;corn and indignation which it de&s;erved. The Landgrave, in return to Mau|rice, taxed him with his treachery and ingratitude to|wards a kin&s;man to whom he was &s;o deeply indebted; be treated with contempt his affectation of executing the Imperial ban, which he could not but know to be alto|gether

<P>BUT Maurice had proceeded too far to be diverted from pur&s;uing his plan by reproaches or arguments. Nothing now remained, but to execute with vigour what he had hitherto carried on by artifice and di&s;&s;imulation. Nor was his boldne&s;s in action inferior to his &s;ubtilty in contrivance. Having a&s;&s;embled about twelve thou&s;and men, he &s;uddenly invaded one part of the electoral pro|vinces, while Ferdinand with an army compo&s;ed of Bo|hemians and Hungarians, over-ran the other. Maurice, in two &s;harp encounters, defeated the troops which the Elector had left to guard his country; and improving the&s;e advantages to the utmo&s;t, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the whole electorate, except Wittemberg, Gotha and Ei&s;enach, which being places of con&s;iderable &s;trength, and defended by &s;ufficient garri&s;ons, refu&s;ed to open their gates. The news of the&s;e rapid conque&s;ts &s;oon reached the Imperial and confederate camps. In the former, their &s;atisfaction with an event, which it was fore&s;een would be productive of the mo&s;t important con&s;equences, was expre&s;&s;ed by every po&s;&s;ible demon&s;tration of joy. The latter was filled with a&s;toni&s;hment and terror. The name of Maurice was mentioned with execration, as an apo&s;tate from religion, a betrayer of the German liber|ty, and a contemner of the mo&s;t &s;acred and natural ties. Every thing that the rage or invention of the party could &s;ugge&s;t, in order to blacken and render him odious; in|vectives, &s;atires and lampoons, the furious declamations of their preachers, together with the rude wit of their authors, were all employed again&s;t him. While he, tru&s;ting to the arts which he had &s;o long practi&s;ed, as if his actions could have admitted of any &s;erious ju&s;tifica|tion, publi&s;hed a manife&s;to, containing the &s;ame frivo|lous rea&s;ons for his conduct, which he had formerly al|ledged

<P>THE Elector, upon the fir&s;t intelligence of Maurice<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> motions, propo&s;ed to return home with his troops for the defence of Saxony. But the deputies of the league, a&s;&s;embled at Ulm, prevailed on him, at that time, to remain with the army, and to prefer the &s;ucce&s;s of the common cau&s;e before the &s;ecurity of his own dominions. At length the &s;ufferings and complaints of his &s;ubjects increa&s;ed &s;o much, that he di&s;covered the utmo&s;t impa|tience to &s;et out, in order to re&s;cue them from the op|pre&s;&s;ion of Maurice, and from the cruelty of the Hun|garians, who having been accu&s;tomed to that licentious and mercile&s;s &s;pecies of war which was thought lawful again&s;t the Turks, committed, where ever they came, the wilde&s;t acts of rapine and violence. This de&s;ire of the Elector's was &s;o natural and &s;o warmly urged, that the deputies at Ulm, though fully &s;en&s;ible of the unhap|py con&s;equences of dividing their army, dur&s;t not refu&s;e their con&s;ent, how unwilling &s;oever to grant it. In the perplexity, they repaired to the camp of the confe|derates at Giengen on the Brenz, in order to con&s;ult their con&s;tituents. Nor were they le&s;s at a lo&s;s what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> determine in this pre&s;&s;ing emergence. But, after hav|ing con&s;idered &s;eriou&s;ly the open de&s;ertion of &s;ome of their allies; the &s;candalous lukewarmne&s;s of others who had hitherto contributed nothing towards the war; the intolerable load which had fallen, of con&s;equence, upon &s;uch members as were mo&s;t zealous for the cau&s;e, or mo&s;t faithful to their engagements; the ill &s;ucce&s;s of all their endeavours to obtain foreign aid; the unu&s;ual length of the campaign; the rigour of the &s;ea&s;on; to|gether with the great number of &s;oldiers, and even of|ficers, who had, on that account, quitted the &s;ervice; they concluded that nothing could &s;ave them, but either the bringing the conte&s;t to the immediate deci&s;ion of a battle by attacking the Imperial army, or an accommo|dation of all their differences with Charles by a treaty.

<P>NO &s;ooner did Charles perceive this haughty confe|deracy, which had &s;o lately threatened to drive him out of Germany, conde&s;cending to make the fir&s;t advances towards an agreement, than concluding their &s;pirit to be gone, or their union to be broken, he immediately a&s;|&s;umed the tone of a conqueror; and, as if they had been already at his mercy, would not hear of a negociation, but upon condition of the Elector of Saxony's con&s;ent|ing previou&s;ly to give up him&s;elf and his dominions ab|&s;olutely to his di&s;po&s;al <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hortentius ap. Scard. ii. 485.</NOTE>. As nothing more intolerable or ignominious could have been pre&s;cribed, even in the wor&s;t &s;ituation of their affairs, it is no wonder this propo&s;ition was rejected by a party, humbled and di&s;concerted rather than &s;ubdued. But though they re|fu&s;ed to &s;ubmit tamely to the Emperor's will, they wanted &s;pirit to pur&s;ue the only plan which could have pre&s;erved their independence; and forgetting that it was the union of their troops in one body which had hi|therto rendered the confederacy formidable, and had more than once obliged the Imperiali&s;ts to think of quitting the field; they incon&s;iderately abandoned that advantage, which, in &s;pite of the diver&s;ion in Saxony, would &s;till have kept the Emperor in awe; and yield|ing to the Elector's intreaties, con&s;ented to his propo&s;al of dividing the army. Nine thou&s;and men were left in the dutchy of Wurtemberg, in order to protect that province, as well as the free cities of Upper Germany; a con&s;iderable body marched with the Elector towards Saxony; but the greater part returned with their re|&s;pective leaders into their own countries, and were di&s;|per&s;ed there <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 411.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE moment the troops &s;eparated, the confederacy cea&s;ed to be the object of terror; and the members of it, who, while they compo&s;ed part of a great body, had felt but little anxiety about their own &s;ecurity, began to tremble when they reflected that they now &s;tood ex|po&s;ed &s;ingly to the whole weight of the Emperor's ven|geance.
<PB N="86" REF="011837_0905_0F9D87ECF0CD06D8">
Charles did not allow them lei&s;ure to recover from their con&s;ternation, or to form any new &s;chemes of union. As &s;oon as the confederates began to retire, he put his army in motion, and though it was now the depth of winter, he re&s;olved to keep the field, in order to make the mo&s;t of that favourable juncture for which he had waited &s;o long. Some &s;mall towns in which the enemy had left garri&s;ons immediately opened their gates. Norlingen, Rotenberg and Hall, Imperial cities, &s;ubmitted &s;oon after. Though Charles could not pre|vent the Elector from levying, as he retreated, large contributions upon the archbi&s;hop of Mentz, the abbot of Fulda, and other eccle&s;ia&s;tics <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Thuan. 88.</NOTE>, this was more than balanced by the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of Ulm, one of the chief cities of Suabia, highly di&s;tingui&s;hed by its zeal for the Smalkaldic league. As &s;oon as an example was &s;et of de&s;erting the common cau&s;e, the re&s;t of the members became in&s;tantly impatient to follow it, and &s;eemed afraid le&s;t others, by getting the &s;tart of them in return|ing to their duty, &s;hould, on that account, obtain more favourable terms. The Elector Palatine, a weak Prince, who, notwith&s;tanding his profe&s;&s;ions of neutrality, had very prepo&s;terou&s;ly, &s;ent to the confederates four hun|dred hor&s;e, a body &s;o incon&s;iderable as to be &s;carce any addition to their &s;trength, but great enough to render him guilty in the eyes of the Emperor, made his ac|knowledgments in the mo&s;t abject manner. The inha|bitants of Aug&s;burgh, &s;haken by &s;o many in&s;tances of apo&s;tacy, expelled the brave Schertel out of their city, and accepted &s;uch conditions as the Emperor was plea&s;ed to grant them.</P>
<P>THE Duke of Wurtemberg, though among the fir&s;t who had offered to &s;ubmit, was obliged to &s;ue for par|don on his knees, and even after this mortifying humi|liation obtained it with difficulty <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Ribier. tom. i. 589.</NOTE>. Memmingen, and other free cities in the circle of Suabia, being now abandoned by all their former a&s;&s;ociates, found it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to provide for their own &s;afety by throwing them&s;elves on the Emperor's mercy.

&s;eat of danger, di&s;covered no greater &s;teadine&s;s than tho&s;e which lay more expo&s;ed. Thus, a confederacy, lately &s;o powerful as to &s;hake the Imperial throne, fell to pieces and was di&s;&s;olved in the &s;pace of a few weeks; &s;carce any member of that formidable combination now remaining in arms, but the Elector and Landgrave, whom the Emperor, having from the beginning mark|ed out as the victims of his vengeance, was at no pains to reconcile. Nor did he grant tho&s;e who &s;ubmitted to him a generous and unconditional pardon. Con&s;cious of his own &s;uperiority, he treated them both with haugh|tine&s;s and rigour. All the Princes in per&s;on, and the ci|ties, by their deputies, were compelled to implore mercy in the humble po&s;ture of &s;upplicants. As the Emperor laboured under great difficulties from the want of mo|ney, he impo&s;ed heavy fines upon them, which he le|vied with mo&s;t rapacious exactne&s;s. The Duke of Wur|temberg paid three hundred thou&s;and crowns; the city of Aug&s;burgh an hundred and fifty thou&s;and; Ulm an hundred thou&s;and; Frankfort eighty thou&s;and; Mem|mingen fifty thou&s;and; and the re&s;t in proportion to their abilities, or their different degrees of guilt. They were obliged, be&s;ides, to renounce the league of Smal|kalde; to furni&s;h a&s;&s;i&s;tance, if required, towards exe|cuting the Imperial ban again&s;t the Elector and Land|grave; to give up their artillery and warlike &s;tores to the Emperor; to admit garri&s;ons into their principal cities and places of &s;trength; and in this di&s;armed and dependent &s;ituation, to expect the final award which the Emperor &s;hould think proper to pronounce when the war came to an i&s;&s;ue <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 411, &amp;c.

<P>THE Elector or Cologne, whom, notwith&s;tanding the &s;entence of excommunication i&s;&s;ued again&s;t him by the Pope, Charles had hitherto allowed to remain in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the archiepi&s;copal &s;ee, being now required by the Emperor to &s;ubmit to the cen&s;ures of the church this virtuous and di&s;intere&s;ted prelate, unwilling to ex|po&s;e his &s;ubjects, on his account, to the mi&s;eries of war, voluntarily re&s;igned that high dignity. With a mode|ration becoming his age and character, he cho&s;e to enjoy truth, together with the exerci&s;e of his religion, in the re|tirement of a private life, rather than to di&s;turb &s;ociety by engaging in a doubtful and violent &s;truggle in order to retain his office <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 418.

<P>MEANWHILE the Elector of Saxony reached the fron|tiers of his country. As Maurice could a&s;&s;emble no force equal to the army which accompanied him, he, in, a &s;hort time, not only recovered po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his own territories, but over-ran Mi&s;nir, and &s;tripped his rival of all that belonged to him, except Dre&s;den and Leip&s;ic, which being towns of &s;ome &s;trength could not be &s;ud|denly reduced. Maurice, obliged to quit the field, and to &s;hut him&s;elf up in his capital, di&s;patched courier af|ter courier to the Emperor, repre&s;enting his dangerous &s;ituation, and &s;oliciting him with the mo&s;t earne&s;t im|portunity to march immediately to his relief. But Charles, bu&s;y at that time in pre&s;cribing terms to &s;uch members of the league as were daily returning to their allegiance, thought it &s;ufficient to detach Albert Mar|quis of Brandenburgh An&s;pach with three thou&s;and men to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Albert, though an enterprizing and active officer, allowed him&s;elf to be &s;urprized by the Elector, who killed many of his troops, di&s;per&s;ed the remainder, and took him pri&s;oner <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Avila 99. 6. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">n. de Ribier, tom. i. 620.</NOTE>.

it&s;elf, his ruin mu&s;t have been immediate and un|avoidable. But the Elector, no le&s;s &s;low and dilatory when inve&s;ted with the &s;ole command, than he had been formerly when joined in authority with a partner, never gave any proof of military activity but in this enter|prize again&s;t Albert. In&s;tead of marching directly to|wards Maurice, whom the defeat of his ally had greatly alarmed, he incon&s;iderately li&s;tened to overtures of ac|commodation, which his artful antagoni&s;t propo&s;ed with no other intention than to amu&s;e him, and to &s;lacken the vigour of his operations.</P>
<P>SUCH, indeed, was the po&s;ture of the Emperor's af|fairs that he could not march in&s;tantly to the relief of his ally. Soon after the &s;eparation of the confederate army, he, in order to ea&s;e him&s;elf of the burden of maintaining a &s;uperfluous number of troops, had di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed the Count of Buren with his Flemings <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Avila 83 6. Mem. de Ribier, tom. i. 592.</NOTE>, imagin|ing that the Spaniards and Germans, together with the papal forces, would be fully &s;ufficient to cru&s;h any de|gree of vigour that yet remained among the members of the league. But Paul, growing wi&s;e too late, began now to di&s;cover the imprudence of that mea&s;ure, from which the more &s;agacious Venetians had endeavoured in vain to di&s;&s;uade him. The rapid progre&s;s of the Im|perial arms, and the ea&s;e with which they had broken a combination that appeared &s;o firm and powerful, open|ed at length his eyes, made him forget at once all the advantages which he had expected from &s;uch a com|pleat triumph over here&s;y, and placed, in the &s;tronge&s;t light, his own impolitic conduct, in having contributed towards acquiring for Charles &s;uch an immen&s;e increa&s;e of power, as would enable him, after oppre&s;&s;ing the liber|ties of Germany, to give law with ab&s;olute authority to all the &s;tates of Italy. The moment he perceived his error, he endeavoured to correct it. Without giving the Emperor any warning of his intention, he ordered Farne&s;e, his grand&s;on, to return in&s;tantly to Italy with all the troops under his command, and at the &s;ame time recalled the licence which he had granted Charles, of appropriating to his own u&s;e, a large &s;hare of the church|lands

in Spain. He was not de&s;titute of pretences to ju&s;tify this abrupt de&s;ertion of his ally. The term of &s;ix months, during which the &s;tipulations in their treaty were to continue in force, was now expired; the league, in oppo&s;ition to which their alliance had been framed, &s;eemed to be entirely di&s;&s;ipated; Charles, in all his ne|gociations with the Princes and cities which had &s;ub|mitted to his will, had neither con&s;ulted the Pope, nor had allotted him any part of the conque&s;ts which he had made, nor had communicated to him any &s;hare in the va&s;t contributions that he had rai&s;ed. He had not even made any provi&s;ion for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of here&s;y, or the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Catholic religion, which were Paul's chief inducements to be&s;tow the trea&s;ures of the church &s;o liberally in carrying on the war. The&s;e colours, how &s;pecious &s;oever, did not conceal from the Emperor that &s;ecret jealou&s;y which was the true motive of the Pope's conduct. But, as Paul's orders with regard to the march of his troops were no le&s;s peremptory than unexpected, it was impo&s;&s;ible to prevent their retreat. Charles exclaimed loudly again&s;t this treachery, in abandoning him &s;o un&s;ea&s;onably, while he was pro&s;e|cuting a war undertaken in compliance with his earne&s;t &s;olicitations, and from which, if &s;ucce&s;sful, &s;o much honour and advantage would redound to the church. To complaints he added threats and expo&s;tulations. But Paul remained inflexible; his troops continued their march towards the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate; and in an elabo|rate memorial, intended as an apology for his behavi|our, he di&s;covered new and more manife&s;t &s;ymptoms of alienation from the Emperor, together with a deep-root|ed terror of his power <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">F.

Charles weakened by the withdrawing of &s;o great a body from his army, which was already much dimini&s;hed by the number of garri|&s;ons that he had been obliged to throw into the towns which had capitulated, found it nece&s;&s;ary to recruit his forces by new levies, before he could venture to march in per&s;on towards Saxony.</P>
<P>THE fame and &s;plendour of his &s;ucce&s;s could not have failed of attracting &s;uch multitudes of &s;oldiers into

his &s;ervice from all the exten&s;ive territories now &s;ubject to his authority, as mu&s;t have &s;oon put him in a condi|tion of taking the field again&s;t the Elector; but the &s;udden and violent eruption of a con&s;piracy at Genoa, as well as the great revolutions which that event, ex|tremely my&s;terious in its fir&s;t appearances, &s;eemed to portend, obliged him to avoid entangling him&s;elf in new operations in Germany, before he had fully di&s;|covered its &s;ource and tendency. The form of govern|ment which had been e&s;tabli&s;hed in Genoa, at the time when Andrew Doria re&s;tored liberty to his country, though calculated to obliterate the memory of former di&s;&s;en&s;ions, and received at fir&s;t with eager approbation, did not, after a trial of near twenty years, give univer&s;al &s;atisfaction to the&s;e turbulent and factious republicans. As the entire admini&s;tration of affairs was now lodged in a certain number of noble families, many, envying them that pre-eminence, wi&s;hed for the re&s;titution of a popular government, to which they had been accu&s;tom|ed; and though all reverenced the di&s;intere&s;ted virtue of Doria, and admired his talents, not a few were jea|lous of that a&s;cendant which he had acquired in all the councils of the commonwealth. His age, however, his moderation, and love of liberty, afforded ample &s;ecurity to his countrymen that he would not abu&s;e his power, nor &s;tain the clo&s;e of his days by attempting to overturn that fabrick, which it had been the labour and pride of his life to erect. But that authority and influence, which in his hands were innocent, they ea&s;ily &s;aw would prove de&s;tructive, if u&s;urped by any citizen of greater am|bition, or le&s;s virtue. A citizen of this dangerous cha|racter had actually formed &s;uch preten&s;ions, and with &s;ome pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. Giannetino Doria, whom his grand uncle Andrew de&s;tined to be the heir of his pri|vate fortune, aimed likewi&s;e at being his &s;ucce&s;&s;or in power. His temper haughty, in&s;olent, and overbear|ing to &s;uch a degree as would &s;carce have been tolerated in one born to reign, was altogether in&s;upportable in the citizen of a free &s;tate; and the more &s;agacious among the Genoe&s;e already feared and hated him as the enemy of tho&s;e liberties for which they were indebted to his uncle. While Andrew him&s;elf, blinded by that vio|lent

and undi&s;cerning affection which per&s;ons in ad|vanced age often contract for the younger members of their family, &s;et no bounds to the indulgence with which he treated him; &s;eeming le&s;s &s;olicitous to &s;ecure and perpetuate the freedom of the commonwealth, than to aggrandize that unde&s;erving kin&s;man.</P>
<P>BUT, whatever &s;u&s;picion of Doria's de&s;igns, or what|ever di&s;&s;atisfaction with the &s;y&s;tem of admini&s;tration in the commonwealth, the&s;e circum&s;tances might have oc|ca&s;ioned, they would have ended, it is probable, in no|thing more than murmurings and complaints, if John Lewis Fie&s;co, Count of Lavagna, ob&s;erving this grow|ing di&s;gu&s;t, had not been encouraged by it to attempt one of the bolde&s;t actions recorded in hi&s;tory. That young nobleman, the riche&s;t and mo&s;t illu&s;trious &s;ub|ject in the republic, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in an eminent degree, all the qualities which win upon the human heart, which command re&s;pect, or &s;ecure attachment. He was grace|ful and maje&s;tic in his per&s;on; magnificent to profu&s;ion; of a genero&s;ity that prevented the wi&s;hes of his friends, and exceeded the expectations of &s;trangers; of an in&s;i|nuating addre&s;s, gentle manners, and a flowing affabili|ty. But under the appearance of the&s;e virtues, which &s;eemed to form him for enjoying and adorning civil life, he concealed all the di&s;po&s;itions which mark men out for taking the lead in the mo&s;t dangerous and dark con|&s;piracies; an in&s;atiable and re&s;tle&s;s ambition, a courage unacquainted with fear, and a mind that di&s;dained &s;ub|ordination. Such a temper could ill brook that &s;tation of inferiority, wherein he was placed in the republic; and as he envied the power which the elder Doria had acquired, he was filled with indignation at the thoughts of its de&s;cending, like an hereditary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, to Gian|netino. The&s;e various pa&s;&s;ions, preying with violence on his turbulent and a&s;piring mind, determined him to attempt overturning that domination to which he could not &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>AT fir&s;t he thought of an alliance with Francis, and even propo&s;ed it to the French amba&s;&s;ador at Rome, as the mo&s;t effectual means of accompli&s;hing this; and af|ter expelling Doria together with the Imperial faction by his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he re&s;olved to put the republic once

more under the protection of that Monarch hoping in return for that &s;ervice to be entru&s;ted with the principal &s;hare in the admini&s;tration of government. But having communicated his &s;cheme to a few cho&s;en confidence, from whom he kept nothing &s;ecret, Verrina, the chief of them, a man of de&s;perate fortune, capable alike of advi&s;ing and of executing the mo&s;t audacious deeds, re|mon&s;trated with earne&s;tne&s;s again&s;t the folly of expo&s;|ing him&s;elf to the mo&s;t imminent danger, while he al|lowed another to reap all the fruits of his &s;ucce&s;s; and exhorted him warmly to aim him&s;elf at that pre-emi|nence in his country, to which he was de&s;tined by his illu&s;trious birth, was called by the voice of his fellow-citizens, and would be rai&s;ed by the zeal of his friends. This di&s;cour&s;e opened &s;uch va&s;t pro&s;pects to Fie&s;co, and &s;o &s;uitable to his genius, that abandoning his own plan, he eagerly adopted that of Verrina. The other per|&s;ons pre&s;ent, though &s;en&s;ible of the hazardous nature of the undertaking, did not choo&s;e to condemn what their patron had &s;o warmly approved. It was in&s;tantly re|&s;olved, in this dark cabal, to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the two Dorias, as well as the principal per&s;ons of their party, to over|turn the e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;y&s;tem of government, and to place Fie&s;co on the ducal throne of Genoa. Time, however, and preparations were requi&s;ite to ripen &s;uch a de&s;ign for execution; and while he was employed in carrying on the&s;e, Fie&s;co made it his chief care to guard again&s;t every thing that might betray his &s;ecret, or create &s;u&s;|picion. The di&s;gui&s;e he a&s;&s;umed was of all others the mo&s;t impenetrable. He &s;eemed to be abandoned en|tirely to plea&s;ure and di&s;&s;ipation. A perpetual gaiety, diver&s;ified by the pur&s;uit of all the amu&s;ements becom|ing his age and rank, engro&s;&s;ed, in appearance, the whole of his time and thoughts. But amid&s;t this hurry of di&s;&s;ipation, he pro&s;ecuted his plan with the mo&s;t cool attention, neither retarding the de&s;ign by a timid he&s;itation, nor precipitating the execution by an exce&s;s of impatience. He continued his corre&s;pondence with the French amba&s;&s;ador at Rome, though without com|municating to him his real intentions, that by his means he might &s;ecure the protection of the French arms, if hereafter he &s;hould find it nece&s;&s;ary to call them to his
<PB N="94" REF="011837_0913_0F9D87F30B0672E0">
aid. He entered into a clo&s;e confederacy with Farne&s;e Duke of Parma, who being di&s;gu&s;ted with the Emperor for refu&s;ing to grant him the inve&s;titure of that dutchy, was eager, to promote any mea&s;ure that tended to dimi|ni&s;h his influence in Italy, or to ruin a family &s;o implicitly devoted to him as that of Doria. Being &s;en&s;ible, that in a maritime &s;tate, the acqui&s;ition of naval power was what he ought chiefly to aim at, he purcha&s;ed four gallies from the Pope, who probably was not unacquainted with the de&s;ign which he had formed, and did not di&s;|approve of it. Under colour of fitting out one of the&s;e gallies to &s;ail on a cruize again&s;t the Turks, he not only a&s;&s;embled a good number of his own va&s;&s;als, but engaged in his &s;ervice many bold adventurers, whom the truce between the Emperor and Solyman had deprived of their u&s;ual occupation and &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>WHILE Fie&s;co was taking the&s;e important &s;teps, he pre&s;erved &s;o admirably his u&s;ual appearance of being devoted intirely to plea&s;ure and amu&s;ement, and paid court with &s;uch artful addre&s;s to the two Dorias, as im|po&s;ed not only on the generous and un&s;u&s;picious mind of Andrew, but deceived Giannetino, who, con&s;cious of his own criminal intentions, was more apt to di&s;tru&s;t the de&s;igns of others. So many in&s;truments being now prepared, nothing remained but to &s;trike the blow. Various con&s;ultations were held by Fie&s;co with his con|fidents, in order to &s;ettle the manner of doing it with the greate&s;t certainty and effect. At fir&s;t, they propo&s;ed to murder the Dorias and their chief adherents, during the celebration of high ma&s;s in the principal church; but as Andrew was often ab&s;ent from the&s;e religious &s;o|lemnities, on account of his great age, that de&s;ign was laid a&s;ide. It was then concerted that Fie&s;co &s;hould in|vite the uncle and nephew, with all their friends whom he had marked out as victims, to his hou&s;e; where it would be ea&s;y to cut them off at once without danger or re&s;i&s;tance; but as Giannetino was obliged to leave the town on the day which they had cho&s;en, it became ne|ce&s;&s;ary likewi&s;e to alter this plan. They at la&s;t deter|mined to attempt by open force, what they found dif|ficult to effect by &s;tratagem, and fixed on the night be|tween the &s;econd and third of January, for the execution
<PB N="95" REF="011837_0914_0F9D87F3B0FB1BB8">
of their enterprize. The time was cho&s;en with great propriety; for, as the Doge of the former year was to quit his office, according to cu&s;tom, on the fir&s;t of the month, and his &s;ucce&s;&s;or could not be elected &s;ooner than the fourth, the republic remained during that in|terval in a &s;ort of anarchy, and Fie&s;co might with le&s;s violence take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the vacant dignity.</P>
<P>THE morning of that day Fie&s;co employed in vi&s;iting his friends, pa&s;&s;ing &s;ome hours among them with a &s;pirit as gay and unembara&s;&s;ed as at other-times. Towards evening he paid court to the Dorias with his u&s;ual marks of re&s;pect, and &s;urveying their countenance and behaviour with the attention natural in his &s;ituation, was happy to ob&s;erve the perfect &s;ecurity in which they re|mained, without the lea&s;t fore&s;ight or dread of that &s;torm which had been &s;o long a gathering, and was now ready to bur&s;t over their heads. From their palace he ha&s;ten|ed to his own, which &s;tood by it&s;elf in the middle of a large court, &s;urrounded by a high wall. The gates had been &s;et open in the morning, and all per&s;ons, without di&s;tinction, were allowed to enter, but &s;trong guards po&s;ted within the court &s;uffered no one to return. Ver|rina, meanwhile, and a few per&s;ons tru&s;ted with the &s;e|cret of the con&s;piracy, after conducting Fie&s;co's va&s;&s;als, as well as the crews of his gallies into the palace in &s;mall bodies, with as little noi&s;e as po&s;&s;ible, di&s;per&s;ed them|&s;elves through the city, and in the name of their patron, invited to an entertaiment the principal citizens whom they knew to be di&s;gu&s;ted with the admini&s;tration of the Dorias, and to have both inclination and courage to at|tempt a change in the government. Of the va&s;t num|ber of per&s;ons who now filled the palace, a few only knew for what purpo&s;e they were a&s;&s;embled, the re&s;t a&s;toni&s;hed at finding, in&s;tead of the preparations for a fea&s;t, a court crouded with armed men, and apartments filled with the in&s;truments of war, gazed on each other with a mixture of impatience, curio&s;ity and terror.</P>
<P>WHILE their minds were in this &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;e and agitation, Fie&s;co appeared. With a look full of alacrity and confidence, he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the per&s;ons of chief di&s;tinction, telling them, that they were not now called to partake of the plea&s;ure of an entertainment, but to

join in a deed of valour, which would lead them to li|berty and immortal renown. He &s;et before their eyes the exorbitant as well as intolerable authority of the elder Doria, which the ambition of Giannetino, and the partiality of the Emperor to a family more devoted to him than to their country, was about to enlarge and to render perpetual. This unrighteous domination, con|tinued he, you have it now in your power to &s;ubvert, and to e&s;tabli&s;h the freedom of your country on a firm ba&s;is. The tyrants mu&s;t be cut off. I have taken the mo&s;t effectual mea&s;ures for this purpo&s;e. My a&s;&s;ociates are numerous. I can depend on allies and protectors if nece&s;&s;ary. Happily the tyrants are as &s;ecure as I have been provident. Their in&s;olent contempt of their countrymen, has bani&s;hed the &s;u&s;picion and timidity which u&s;ually render the guilty quick-&s;ighted to di&s;cern, as well as &s;agacious to guard again&s;t the vengeance which they de&s;erve. They will now feel the blow, before they &s;u&s;pect any ho&s;tile hand to be nigh. Let us then &s;ally forth, that we may deliver our country by one generous effort, almo&s;t unaccompanied with danger, and certain of &s;ucce&s;s. The&s;e words, uttered with that irre&s;i&s;table fervour which animates the mind when rouzed by great objects, made the de&s;ired impre&s;&s;ion on the audience. Fie&s;co's va&s;&s;als, ready to execute whatever their ma&s;ter &s;hould command, received his di&s;cour&s;e with a murmur of applau&s;e. To many who&s;e fortunes were de&s;perate, the licence and confu&s;ion of an in&s;urrection afforded an agreeable pro&s;pect. Tho&s;e of higher rank and more virtuous &s;entiments, dur&s;t not di&s;cover the &s;urprize or horror with which they were &s;truck at the propo&s;al of an enterprize &s;o unexpected and attrocious; as each ima|gined the other to be in the &s;ecret of the con&s;piracy, and &s;aw him&s;elf &s;urrounded by per&s;ons who waited only a &s;ignal from their leader to perpetrate the greate&s;t crime. With one voice then all applauded, or feigned to ap|plaud, the undertaking.</P>
<P>HAVING thus fixed and encouraged his a&s;&s;ociates, be|fore he gave them his la&s;t orders, he ha&s;tened for a mo|ment to the apartment of his wife, a lady of the noble hou&s;e of Cibo, whom he loved with tender affection, and who&s;e beauty and virtue rendered her worthy of his love.

The noi&s;e of the armed men who crouded the court and palace, having long before this reached her ears, &s;he concluded &s;ome hazardous enterprize to be in hand, and &s;he trembled for her hu&s;band.

<P>AS &s;oon as he rejoined his companions, he allotted each his proper &s;tation; &s;ome were appointed to a&s;&s;ault and &s;eize the different gates of the city; &s;ome to make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the different &s;treets or places of &s;trength: Fie&s;co re&s;erved for him&s;elf the attack of the harbour where Doria's gallies were laid up, as the po&s;t of chief importance, and of greate&s;t danger. It was now midnight, and the citizens &s;lept in the &s;ecurity of peace, when this band of con&s;pirators, numerous, de&s;|perate and well armed, ru&s;hed out to execute their plan. They &s;urprized, without re&s;i&s;tance, &s;ome of the gates. They got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of others after a &s;harp conflict with the &s;oldiers on guard. Verrina, with the galley that had been fitted out again&s;t the Turks, blocked up the mouth of the Dar&s;ena or little harbour where Doria's fleet lay. All po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;cape being by this pre|caution cut off, when Fie&s;co attempted to enter the gal|lies from the &s;hore to which they were made fa&s;t, as they were unrigged and di&s;armed, having no crew on board but the &s;laves chained to the oar, they were in no con|dition to make re&s;i&s;tance. Every quarter of the city was now filled with noi&s;e and tumult, and all the &s;treets re&s;ounding with the cry of <HI>Fie&s;co and liberty.</HI> At that name, &s;o popular and beloved, many of the lower rank

took arms, and joined the con&s;pirators. The nobles and partizans of the ari&s;tocracy, a&s;toni&s;hed or affrighted, &s;hut the gates of their hou&s;es, and thought of nothing but &s;ecuring them from pillage. At la&s;t, the noi&s;e excited by this &s;cene of violence and confu&s;ion, reached the pa|lace of Doria; Giannetino &s;tarted immediately from his bed, and imagining that it was occa&s;ioned by &s;ome mu|tiny among the &s;ailors, ru&s;hed out with a few attend|ants, and hurried towards the harbour. The gate of St. Thomas through which he had to pa&s;s, was already in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the con&s;pirators, who, the moment he entered, fall upon him with the utmo&s;t fury, and murdered him upon the &s;pot. The &s;ame mu&s;t have been the fate of the elder Doria, if Jerome de Fie&s;co had executed his brother's plan, and had proceeded im|mediately to attack him in his palace; but he, from the &s;ordid con&s;ideration of preventing its being plundered amid&s;t the confu&s;ion, having forbid his followers to ad|vance. Andrew got intelligence of his nephew's death, as well as of his own danger; and mounting on hor&s;e|back, &s;aved him&s;elf by flight. Meanwhile, a few &s;enators that had the courage to a&s;&s;emble in the palace of the re|public <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Il palazza della de Signoria.</NOTE>. At fir&s;t, &s;ome of the mo&s;t daring among them attempted to rally the &s;cattered &s;oldiers, and to attack a body of the con&s;pirators; but being repul&s;ed with lo&s;s, all agreed that nothing now remained, but to treat with the party which &s;eemed to be irre&s;i&s;tible. Depu|ties were accordingly &s;ent to learn of Fie&s;co what were the conce&s;&s;ions with which he would be &s;atisfied, or ra|ther to &s;ubmit to whatever terms he &s;hould plea&s;e to pre&s;cribe.</P>
<P>BUT by this time Fie&s;co, with whom they were em|powered to negociate, was no more. Ju&s;t as he was going to leave the harbour, where every thing had &s;uc|ceeded to his wi&s;h, that he might join his victorious companions, he heard &s;ome extraordinary uproar on board the Admiral galley. Alarmed at the noi&s;e, and fearing that the &s;laves might break their chains, and overpower his a&s;&s;ociates, he ran thither; but the plank which reached from the &s;hore to the ve&s;&s;el happening to
<PB N="99" REF="011837_0918_0F9D87F830B427A8">
overturn, he fell into the &s;ea, whil&s;t he hurried forward too precipitately. Being loaded with heavy armour, he &s;unk to the bottom, and peri&s;hed in the very moment when he mu&s;t have taken full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every thing that his ambitious heart could de&s;ire. Verrina was the fir&s;t who di&s;covered this fatal accident, and fore&s;eeing, at once, all its con&s;equences, concealed it with the ut|mo&s;t indu&s;try from every one but a few leaders of the con&s;piracy. Nor was it difficult, amid&s;t the darkne&s;s and confu&s;ion of the night, to have kept it &s;ecret, until a treaty with the &s;enators &s;hould have put the city in the power of the con&s;pirators. All their hopes of this were di&s;concerted by the imprudence of Jerome Fie&s;co, who, when the deputies of the &s;enate enquired for his brother, the Count of Lavagna, that they might make their pro|po&s;als to him, replied with a childi&s;h vanity, "I am now the only per&s;on to whom that title belongs, and with me you mu&s;t treat." The&s;e words di&s;covered both to his friends and enemies what had happened, and made the impre&s;&s;ion that might have been expected upon both. The deputies, encouraged by this event, the only one which could occa&s;ion &s;uch a &s;udden revolution as might turn to their advantage, a&s;&s;umed in&s;tantly, with admirable pre&s;ence of mind, a new tone, &s;uitable to the change in their circum&s;tances, and made high demands. While they endeavoured to gain time by protracting the negociation, the re&s;t of the &s;enators were bu&s;y in a&s;&s;em|bling their partizans, and forming a body capable of de|fending the palace of the republic. On the other hand, the con&s;pirators, a&s;toni&s;hed at the death of a man whom they adored and tru&s;ted, and placing no confidence in Jerome, a giddy youth, felt their courage <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">away, and their arms fall from their hands. That profound and amazing &s;ecrecy with which the con&s;piracy had been concerted, and which had contributed hitherto &s;o much to its &s;ucce&s;s, proved now the chief cau&s;e of its mi&s;car|riage. The leader was gone, the greater part of tho&s;e who acted under him, knew not his confidents, and were &s;trangers to the object at which he aimed. There was no per&s;on among them who&s;e authority or abilities intitled him to a&s;&s;ume Fie&s;co's place, or to fini&s;h his plan; after having lo&s;t the &s;pirit which animated it, life

and activity de&s;erted the whole body. Many of the con&s;pirators withdrew to their hou&s;es, hoping, that amid&s;t the darkne&s;s of the night they had pa&s;&s;ed unob&s;erved, and might remain unknown. Others &s;ought for &s;afety by a timely retreat; and before break of day, all of them fled with precipitation from a city, which, but a few hours before, was ready to acknowledge them as ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>NEXT morning every thing was quiet in Genoa; not an enemy was to be &s;een; few marks of the violence of the former night appeared, the con&s;pirators having con|ducted their enterprize with more noi&s;e than blood&s;hed, and gained all their advantages by &s;urprize rather than by force of arms. Towards evening Andrew Doria re|turned to the city, being met by all the inhabitants, who received him with acclamations of joy. Though the di&s;grace as well as danger of the preceding night, were fre&s;h in his mind, and the mangled body of his kin&s;man &s;till before his eyes, &s;uch was his moderation and mag|nanimity, that the decree i&s;&s;ued by the &s;enate again&s;t the con&s;pirators, did not exceed that ju&s;t mea&s;ure of &s;everity which was requi&s;ite for the &s;upport of government, and was dictated neither by the violence of re&s;entment, not the rancour of revenge <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Thuan. 93.

<P>AFTER taking the nece&s;&s;ary precautions for prevent|ing the flame, which was now &s;o happily extingui&s;hed, from breaking out anew, the fir&s;t care of the &s;enate was to &s;end an amba&s;&s;ador to the Emperor to give him a particular detail of what had happened, and to beg his a&s;&s;i&s;tance towards the reduction of Montobbio, a &s;trong fort on the hereditary e&s;tate of the Fie&s;ci, in which Je|rome had &s;hut him&s;elf up.

&s;oever, dur&s;t have attempted &s;uch an enterprize, but on foreign &s;ugge&s;tion, and from hope of foreign aid.

Proceeding from this to a farther conjecture, which Paul's cautious maxims of policy in other in&s;tances, rendered extremely probable, he concluded that the French King mu&s;t have known and approved of the de&s;ign; and he began to apprehend that this &s;park might again kindle the flame of war which had raged &s;o long in Italy. As he had drained his Italian territories of troops on account of the German war, he was altogether unprovided for re&s;i&s;ting any ho&s;tile attack in that country; and on the fir&s;t ap|pearance of danger he mu&s;t have detached thither the greate&s;t part of its forces for its defence.

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE REIGN OF THE EMPEROR CHARLES V. BOOK IX.</HEAD>
<P>THE Emperor's dread of the ho&s;tile inten|tions of the Pope and French King did not proceed from any imaginary or ill-ground|ed &s;u&s;picion. Paul had already given the &s;tronge&s;t proofs both of his jealou&s;y and enmity. Charles could not hope, that Francis, after a rival&s;hip of &s;o long continuance, would behold the great advantages which he had gained over the confederate Prote&s;tants, with|out feeling his antient emulation revive. He was not deceived in this conjecture. Francis had ob&s;erved the rapid progre&s;s of his arms with deep concern, and though prevented hitherto, by circum&s;tances which have been mentioned, from interpo&s;ing in order to check them, he was now convinced that, if he did not make &s;ome extraordinary and timely effort, Charles mu&s;t ac|quire &s;uch a degree of power as would enable him to give law to the re&s;t of Europe. This apprehen&s;ion, which did not take its ri&s;e from the envy of rival&s;hip alone, but was entertained by the wi&s;e&s;t politicians of the age, &s;ugge&s;ted various expedients which might &s;erve to retard the cour&s;e of the Emperor's victories, and to form, by degrees, &s;uch a combination again&s;t him as might put a &s;top to his dangerous career.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="011837_0922_0F9D87FA72FBBA30">WITH this view, Francis in&s;tructed his emi&s;&s;aries in Germany to employ all their addre&s;s in order to revive the courage of the confederates, and to prevent them from &s;ubmitting to the Emperor. He made liberal of|fers of his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and entering into a clo&s;e corre&s;pon|dence with the Elector and Landgrave, whom he knew to be the mo&s;t zealous, as well as the mo&s;t powerful of the whole body, he u&s;ed every argument, and propo&s;ed every advantage which could either confirm their dread of the Emperor's de&s;igns, or determine them not to imi|tate the incon&s;iderate credulity of their a&s;&s;ociates in giv|ing up their religion and liberties to his di&s;po&s;al. While he took this &s;tep towards continuing the civil war which raged in Germany, he endeavoured, likewi&s;e, to &s;tir up foreign enemies again&s;t the Emperor. He &s;olicited So|lyman to &s;eize this favourable opportunity of invading Hungary, which had been drained of all the troops ne|ce&s;&s;ary for its defence, in order to form the army again&s;t the confederates of Smalkalde. He exhorted the Pope to repair, by a vigorous and &s;ea&s;onable effort, the error of which he had been guilty in contributing to rai&s;e the Emperor to &s;uch a formidable height of power. Finding Paul, both from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own mi&s;take, and his dread of its con&s;equences, abundantly di&s;po&s;ed to li&s;ten to his exhortations, he availed him&s;elf of this favourable di&s;po&s;ition which the Pontiff began to di&s;|cover, as an argument to gain the Venetians. He en|deavoured to convince them that nothing could &s;ave Italy, and even Europe from oppre&s;&s;ion and &s;ervitude, but their joining the Pope and him, in giving the fir&s;t be|ginning to a general confederacy, in order to humble that ambitious Potentate, whom they had all equal rea|&s;on to dread.</P>
<P>HAVING &s;et on foot the&s;e negociations in the &s;outhern courts, he turned his attention next towards tho&s;e in the north of Europe. As the King of Denmark had par|ticular rea&s;ons to be offended with the Emperor, Francis imagined that he would not be backward to approve of the league which he had projected; and le&s;t con&s;idera|tions of caution or prudence &s;hould re&s;train him from joining in it, he attempted to overcome the&s;e, by offer|ing him the young Queen of Scots in marriage to his

As the mini&s;ters who governed England in the name of Edward VI. had openly declared them&s;elves converts to the opinions of the Reformers, as &s;oon as it became &s;afe upon Henry's death to lay a&s;ide that di&s;|gui&s;e, which his unforgiving bigotry had forced them to a&s;&s;ume, Francis flattered him&s;elf, that their zeal would not allow them to remain inactive &s;pectators of the over|throw and de&s;truction of tho&s;e who profe&s;&s;ed the &s;ame faith with them&s;elves; and he hoped, that notwith&s;tand|ing the &s;truggles of faction incident to a minority, and the pro&s;pect of an approaching rupture with the Scots, he might prevail on them likewi&s;e to take part in the common cau&s;e <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Rib. i. 635.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>OPERATIONS &s;o complicated, and which required the putting &s;o many in&s;truments in motion, did not e&s;cape the Emperor's ob&s;ervation. He was &s;oon in|formed of Francis's intrigues in the &s;everal courts, as well as of his dome&s;tic preparations; and &s;en&s;ible how fatal an interruption a foreign war would prove to his de&s;igns in Germany, he trembled at the pro&s;pect of that event. The danger, however, appeared to him as un|avoidable as it was great. He knew the in&s;atiable and well directed ambition of Solyman, and that he always cho&s;e the &s;ea&s;on for beginning his military enterprizes with prudence equal to the valour with which he con|ducted them. The Pope, as he had good rea&s;on to be|lieve, wanted not pretexts to ju&s;tify a rupture, nor incli|nations to begin ho&s;tilities. He had already made &s;ome

The Venetians, Charles was well a&s;&s;ured, had long ob&s;erved the growth of his power with jealou&s;y, which added to the &s;olicitations and promi&s;es of France, might at la&s;t quicken their flow coun&s;els, and overcome their natural caution. The Danes and Engli&s;h, it was evident, had both peculiar rea&s;on to be di&s;gu&s;ted, as well as &s;trong motives to act again&s;t him. But above all, he dreaded the active emulation of Francis him&s;elf, whom he con&s;i|dered as the &s;oul and mover of any confederacy that could be formed again&s;t him; and as that Monarch had afforded protection to Verrina, who &s;ailed directly to Mar&s;eilles upon the mi&s;carriage of Fie&s;co's, con&s;piracy, Charles expected every moment the commencement of the&s;e ho&s;tile operations in Italy, of which he conceived the in&s;urrection in Genoa to have been only the pre|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">de.</P>
<P>BUT while he remained in this &s;tate of &s;u&s;pen&s;e and &s;olicitude, there was one circum&s;tance which afforded him &s;ome pro&s;pect of e&s;caping the danger. The French King's health began to decline. A di&s;ea&s;e, the effect of his intemperance and incon&s;iderate pur&s;uit of plea&s;ure, preyed gradually on his con&s;titution. The preparations of war, as well as the negociations in the different courts, began to langui&s;h, together with the Monarch, who gave &s;pirit to both. The Genoe&s;e, during that interval, re|duced Montobbio, took Jerome Fie&s;co pri&s;oner, and putting him, together with his chief adherents to death, extingui&s;hed all remains of the con&s;piracy. Several of the Imperial cities in Germany, de&s;pairing of timely a&s;|&s;i&s;tance from France, &s;ubmitted to the Emperor. Even the Landgrave &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to abandon the Elector, and to bring matters to a &s;peedy accommodation, on &s;uch terms as he could obtain. In the mean time,

Charles waited with impatience the i&s;&s;ue of a di&s;temper, which was to decide whether he mu&s;t relinqui&s;h all other &s;chemes, in order to prepare for re&s;i&s;ting a combination of the greater part of Europe again&s;t him, or whether he might proceed to invade Saxony, without interrup|tion or fear of danger.</P>
<P>THE good fortune, &s;o remarkably propitious to his family, that &s;ome hi&s;torians have called it the <HI>Star of the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria,</HI> did not de&s;ert him on this occa&s;ion. Francis died at Rambouillet, on the la&s;t day of March, in the fifty-third year of his age, and the thirty-third of his reign. During twenty-eight years of that time, as avowed rival&s;hip &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between him and the Empe|ror, which involved not only their own dominions, but the greater part of Europe in wars, pro&s;ecuted with more violent animo&s;ity, and drawn out to a greater length, than had been known in any former period. Many cir|cum&s;tances contributed to both. Their animo&s;ity was founded in oppo&s;ition of intere&s;t, heightened by per|&s;onal emulation, and exa&s;perated not only by mutual in|juries, but by reciprocal in&s;ults. At the &s;ame time, whatever advantage one &s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s towards gaining the a&s;cendant, was wonderfully balanced by &s;ome favourable circum&s;tance, peculiar to the other. The Emperor's dominions were of great extent, the French King's lay more compact; Francis governed his kingdom with ab&s;olute power; that of Charles was limited, but he &s;upplied the want of authority by ad|dre&s;s; the troops of the former were more impetuous and enterprizing; tho&s;e of the latter better di&s;ciplined, and more patient of fatigue. The talents and abilities of the two Monarchs were as different as the advantages which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and contributed no le&s;s to prolong the conte&s;t between them. Francis took his re&s;olutions &s;uddenly, pro&s;ecuted them at fir&s;t with warmth, and pu&s;hed them into execution with a mo&s;t adventrous courage; but being de&s;titute of the per&s;everance ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;urmount difficulties, he often abandoned his de&s;igns, or relaxed the vigour of pur&s;uit, from impa|tience, and &s;ometimes from levity. Charles deliberated long, and determined with coolne&s;s; but, having once fixed his plan, he adhered to it with inflexible ob&s;tinacy,
<PB N="107" REF="011837_0926_0F9D87FD705B0B28">
and neither danger nor di&s;couragement could turn him a&s;ide from the execution of it. The &s;ucce&s;s of their en|terprizes was altogether as different as their characters, and was uniformly influenced by them. Francis, by his impetuous activity, often di&s;concerted the Emperor's be&s;t laid &s;chemes; Charles, by a more calm but &s;teady pro&s;ecution of his de&s;igns, checked the rapidity of his rival's career, and baffled or repul&s;ed his mo&s;t vigorous efforts. The former, at the opening of a war or of a campaign, broke in upon his enemy with the violence of a torrent, and carried all before him; the latter, wait|ing until he &s;aw the force of his rival begin to abate, re|covered in the end not only all that he had lo&s;t, but made new acqui&s;itions. Few of the French Monarch's at|tempts towards conque&s;t, whatever promi&s;ing a&s;pect they might wear at fir&s;t, were conducted to an happy i&s;&s;ue; many of the Emperor's enterprizes, even after they appeared de&s;perate and impracticable, terminated in the mo&s;t pro&s;perous manner. Francis was dazzled with the &s;plendour of an undertaking; Charles was al|lured by the pro&s;pect of its turning to his advantage. The degree, however, of their comparative merit and re|putation, has not been fixed either by a &s;trict &s;crutiny into their abilities for government, or by an impartial con&s;ideration of the greatne&s;s and &s;ucce&s;s of their under|takings; and Francis is one of tho&s;e Monarchs who occupies a higher rank in the temple of fame, than ei|ther his talents or performances intitle him to hold. This pre-eminence he owed to many different circum&s;tances. The &s;uperiority which Charles acquired by the victory of Pavia, and which from that period he pre&s;erved through the remainder of his reign, was &s;o manife&s;t, that Francis's &s;truggle again&s;t his exorbitant and grow|ing dominion was viewed by mo&s;t of the other powers, not only with the partiality which naturally ari&s;es for tho&s;e who gallantly maintain an unequal conte&s;t, but with the favour due to one who was re&s;i&s;ting a common enemy, and endeavouring to &s;et bounds to a Monarch equally formidable to them all. The characters of Princes, too, e&s;pecially among their contemporaries, de|pend not only upon their talents for government, but upon their qualities as men. Francis, notwith&s;tanding
<PB N="108" REF="011837_0927_0F9D87FE3113FED0">
the many errors con&s;picuous in his foreign policy and dome&s;tic admini&s;tration, was neverthele&s;s humane, bene|ficent and generous. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed dignity without pride; affability free from meanne&s;s; and courte&s;y exempt from deceit. All who had acce&s;s to him, and no man of merit was ever denied that privilege, re&s;pected and loved him. Captivated with his per&s;onal qualities, he &s;ubjects forgot his defects as a Monarch, and admiring him as the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed and amiable gentleman in his dominions, they never murmured at acts of male-admini&s;tration, which in a Prince of le&s;s engaging di&s;|po&s;itions, would have been deemed unpardonable. This admiration, however, mu&s;t have been temporary only, and would have died away with the courtiers who be|&s;towed it; the illu&s;ion ari&s;ing from his private virtues mu&s;t have cea&s;ed, and po&s;terity would have judged of his public conduct with its u&s;ual impartiality; but an|other circum&s;tance prevented this, and his name hath been tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity with increa&s;ing reputation. Science and the arts had, at that time, made little pro|gre&s;s in France. They were ju&s;t beginning to advance beyond the limits of Italy, where they had revived, and which had hitherto been their only &s;eat. Francis took them immediately under his protection, and vied with Leo him&s;elf, in the zeal and munificence with which he encouraged them. He invited learned men to his court, he conver&s;ed with them familiarly, he employed them in bu&s;ine&s;s, he rai&s;ed them to offices of dignity, and ho|noured them with his confidence. That race of men, not more prone to complain when denied the re&s;pect to which they fancy them&s;elves intitled, than apt to be plea&s;|ed when treated with the di&s;tinction which they con&s;ider as their due, thought they could not exceed in gratitude to &s;uch a benefactor, and &s;trained their invention, and employed all their ingenuity in panegyric. Succeeding authors, warmed with their de&s;criptions of Francis's bounty, adopted their encomiums, and refined upon them. The appellation of Father of Letters be&s;towed upon Francis, hath rendered his memory &s;acred among hi&s;torians, and they &s;eem to have regarded it as a &s;ort of impiety to uncover his infirmities, or to point out his de|fects. Thus Francis, notwith&s;tanding his inferior abili|ties,
<PB N="109" REF="011837_0928_0F9D87FEF481B238">
and want of &s;ucce&s;s, hath more than equalled the fame of Charles. The virtues which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed as a man, have intitled him to greater admiration and prai&s;e than have been be&s;towed upon the exten&s;ive genius and fortunate arts of a more capable, but le&s;s amiable rival.</P>
<P>BY his death, a con&s;iderable change was made in the &s;tate of Europe. Charles, grown old in the arts of go|vernment and command, had now to contend only with younger Monarchs, who could not be regarded as an equal match for him, who had &s;tood the encounter with Henry VIII. and Francis I. and come off with honour in all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e different conte&s;ts. By this event he was ea&s;ed of all his di&s;quietude, and was happy to find that he might begin with &s;afety tho&s;e operations again&s;t the Elector of Saxony, which he had hitherto been obliged to &s;u&s;pend. He knew the abilities of Henry II. who had ju&s;t mounted the throne of France, to be greatly in|ferior to tho&s;e of his father, and fore&s;aw that he would be &s;o much occupied for &s;ome time in di&s;placing the late King's mini&s;ters, whom he hated, and in gratifying the ambitious demands of his own favourites, that he had nothing to dread, either from his per&s;onal efforts, or from any confederacy which this unexperienced Prince could form.</P>
<P>BUT as it was uncertain how long &s;uch an interval of &s;ecurity might continue, Charles determined in&s;tantly to improve it; and as &s;oon as he heard of Francis's demi&s;e, he began his march from Egra, on the borders of Bo|hemia. But the departure or the papal troops, together with the retreat of the Flemings, had &s;o much dimini&s;h|ed his army, that &s;ixteen thou&s;and men were all he could a&s;&s;emble. With this incon&s;iderable body he &s;et out on an expedition, the event of which was to decide what degree of authority he &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s from that period in Germany; but as this little army con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of the veteran Spani&s;h and Italian bands, he did not, in tru&s;ting to them, commit much to the deci&s;ion of chance, and even with &s;o &s;mall a force he had rea&s;on to entertain the mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes of &s;ucce&s;s. The Elector, it is true, had levied an army greatly &s;uperior in number; but neither the experience and di&s;cipline of his troops, nor the abilities of his officers, were to be compared
<PB N="110" REF="011837_0929_0F9D87FFB0E472F0">
with tho&s;e of the Emperor. The Elector, be&s;ides, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> already been guilty of an error, which deprived him o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> all the advantage which he might have derived from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;uperiority in number, and was alone &s;ufficient to have occa&s;ioned his ruin. In&s;tead of keeping his forces united, detached one great body towards the frontiers of Bohe|mia, in order to facilitate his junction with the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> contents of that kingdom, and cantoned a con&s;iderable part of what remained in different places of Saxony, where he expected the Emperor would make the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion, vainly imagining, that the&s;e open town, with &s;mall garri&s;ons, might be rendered tenable again&s;t an enemy.</P>
<P>THE Emperor entered the &s;outhern frontier of Saxony, and attacked Altorf upon the El&s;ter. The folly of the mea&s;ure which the Elector had taken was immediately &s;een, the troops po&s;ted in that town &s;urrendering with|out re&s;i&s;tance; and tho&s;e in all the other places between that and the Elbe, either imitated their example, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> as the Imperiali&s;ts approached. Charles, that they might not recover from the panic with which they &s;eemed to be &s;truck, advanced without lo&s;ing a moment. The Elector, who had fixed his head quarters at Mei&s;&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, continued in his wonted &s;tate of fluctuation and uncer|tainty. He even became more undetermined, in propor|tion as the danger grew near and called for prompt and deci&s;ive re&s;olutions. Sometimes he acted, as if he had re&s;olved to defend the banks of the Elbe, and to hazard a battle with the enemy, as &s;oon as the detachments which he had called were able to join him. At other times, he abandoned this as ra&s;h and perilous, &s;eeming to adopt the more prudent councils of tho&s;e who advi&s;ed him to endeavour at protracting the war, and for that end to retire under the fortifications of Wittemberg, where the Imperiali&s;ts could not attack him without manife&s;t di&s;advantage, and where he might wait in &s;afe|ty for the &s;uccours which he expected from Meckle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|burgh, Pomerania, and the Prote&s;tant cities on the Bal|tic. Without fixing upon either of the&s;e plans, he broke down the bridge at Mei&s;&s;en, and marched along the ea&s;t bank of the Elbe to Muhlberg. There he de|liberated anew, and after much he&s;itation, adopted one
<PB N="111" REF="011837_0930_0F9D880070EA3398">
of the&s;e middle &s;chemes, which are always acceptable to feeble minds incapable of deciding. He left a detach|ment at Muhlberg to oppo&s;e the Imperiali&s;ts, if they &s;hould attempt to pa&s;s at that place, and advancing a few miles with his main body, encamped there in ex|pectation of the event, according to which he propo&s;ed to regulate his &s;ub&s;equent motions.</P>
<P>CHARLES, meanwhile, pu&s;hing forward ince&s;&s;antly, arrived the evening of the twenty-third of April on the banks of the Elbe oppo&s;ite to Muhlberg. The river, at that place, was three hundred paces in breadth, above four feet in depth, its current rapid, and the bank po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Saxons was higher than that which he oc|cupied. Undi&s;mayed, however, by all the&s;e ob&s;tactles, he called together his general officers, and without a&s;k|ing their opinions, communicated to them his intention of attempting next morning to force his pa&s;&s;age over the river, and to attack the enemy wherever he could come up with them. They all expre&s;&s;ed their a&s;toni&s;h|ment at &s;uch a bold re&s;olution, and even the Duke of Alva, though naturally daring and impetuous, and Maurice of Saxony, notwith&s;tanding his impatience to cru&s;h his rival the Elector, remon&s;trated earne&s;tly again&s;t it. But the Emperor, confiding in his own judgment, or good fortune, paid no regard to their arguments, and gave the orders nece&s;&s;ary for executing his de&s;ign.</P>
<P>EARLY in the morning, a body of Spani&s;h and Ita|lian foot marched towards the river, and began an in|ce&s;&s;ant fire upon the enemy. The long heavy mu&s;kets u&s;ed in that age, did execution on the oppo&s;ite bank, and many of the &s;oldiers, hurried on by a martial ardour in order to get nearer the enemy, ru&s;hed into the &s;tream, and advancing brea&s;t high, fired with a more certain aim, and with greater effect. Under cover of their fire, a bridge of boats was begun to be laid for the infantry; and a pea&s;ant having undertaken to conduct the cavalry through the river by a ford with which he was well ac|quainted, they al&s;o were put in motion. The Saxons po&s;ted in Muhlberg endeavoured to ob&s;truct the&s;e ope|rations, by a bri&s;k fire from a battery, which they had erected; but as a thick fog covered all the low grounds upon the river, they could not take aim with any cer|tainty,
<PB N="112" REF="011837_0931_0F9D880131A7DA60">
and the Imperiali&s;ts &s;uffered very little; at the &s;ame time the Saxons being much galled by the Spa|niards and Italians, they &s;et on fire &s;ome boats which had been collected near the village, and prepared to re|tire. The Imperiali&s;ts perceiving this, ten Spani&s;h &s;ol|diers in&s;tantly &s;tript them&s;elves, and holding their &s;words with their teeth, &s;wam acro&s;s the river, put to flight &s;uch of the Saxons as ventured to oppo&s;e them, &s;aved from the flames as many boats as were &s;ufficient to com|pleat their own bridge, and by this &s;pirited and &s;uc|ce&s;sful action, encouraged their companions no le&s;s that they intimidated the enemy.</P>
<P>BY this time, the cavalry, each trooper having a foot &s;oldier behind him, began to enter the river, the light hor&s;e marching in the front, followed by the men at arms, whom the Emperor led in per&s;on, mounted on a Spani&s;h hor&s;e, dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;umptuous habit, and carry|ing a javelin in his hand. Such a numerous body &s;truggling through a great river, in which, according to the directions of their guide, they were obliged to make &s;everal turns, &s;ometimes treading on a firm bottom, &s;ometimes &s;wimming, pre&s;ented to their companions, whom they left behind, a &s;pectacle equally magnificent and intere&s;ting <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Avila, 115. a.</NOTE>. Their courage, at la&s;t, &s;urmounted every ob&s;tacle, no man betraying any &s;ymptom of fear, when the Emperor &s;hared in the danger no le&s;s than the meane&s;t &s;oldier. The moment that they reached the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, Charles, without waiting the arrival of the re&s;t of the infantry, advanced towards the Saxons with the troops which had pa&s;&s;ed along with him, who, flu&s;hed with their good fortune, and de&s;pi&s;ing an enemy who had neglected to oppo&s;e them, when it might have been done with &s;uch advantage, made no account of their &s;uperior numbers, and marched on as to a certain victory.</P>
<P>DURING all the&s;e operations, which nece&s;&s;arily con|&s;umed much time, the Elector remained inactive in his camp; and from an infatuation which appears to be &s;o amazing, that the be&s;t informed hi&s;torians impute it to the treacherous arts of his generals, who deceived him
<PB N="113" REF="011837_0932_0F9D8801F0B7C958">
by fal&s;e intelligence, he would not believe that the Em|peror had pa&s;&s;ed the river, or could be &s;o near at hand <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Camerar. ap. Freher. iii. 493. Struv. corp. hi&s;t. Germ. 1047, 1049.</NOTE>. Being convinced, at la&s;t, of his fatal mi&s;take, by the concurring te&s;timony of eye witne&s;&s;es, he gave orders for retreating towards Wittemberg. But a German ar|my, encumbered, as u&s;ual, with baggage and artillery, could not be put &s;uddenly in motion. They had &s;carce begun, to march when the light troops of the enemy came in view, and the Elector &s;aw an engagement to be unavoidable. As he was no le&s;s bold in action than ir|re&s;olute in council, he made the di&s;po&s;ition for battle with the greate&s;t pre&s;ence of mind, and in the mo&s;t proper manner, taking advantage of a great fore&s;t to cover his wings, &s;o as to prevent his being &s;urrounded by the enemy's cavalry, which were far more numerous than his own. The Emperor, likewi&s;e, ranged his men in order as they came up, and riding along the ranks, ex|horted them with few, but efficacious words, to do their duty. It was with a very different &s;pirit that the two armies advanced to the charge. As the day, which had hitherto been dark and cloudy, happened to clear up at that moment, this accidental circum&s;tance made an im|pre&s;&s;ion on the different parties corre&s;ponding to the tone of their minds; the Saxons, &s;urprized and di&s;|heartened, felt pain at being expo&s;ed fully to the view of the enemy; the Imperiali&s;ts, being now &s;ecure that the Prote&s;tant forces could not e&s;cape from them, re|joiced at the return of &s;un-&s;hine, as a certain pre&s;age of victory. The &s;hock of battle would not have been long or doubtful, if the per&s;onal courage which the Elector di&s;played, together with the activity which he exerted from the moment that the approach of the ene|my rendered an engagement certain, and cut off all po&s;|&s;ibility of he&s;itation, had not revived in &s;ome degree the &s;pirit of his troops. They repul&s;ed the Hungarian light hor&s;e, who began the attack, and received with firmne&s;s the men at arms who next advanced to the charge; but as the&s;e were the flower of the Imperial army, were commanded by experienced officers, and
<PB N="114" REF="011837_0933_0F9D8802B0CFAE88">
fought under the Emperor's eye, the Saxons &s;oon be|gan to give way, and the light troops rallying at the &s;ame time, and falling on their flanks, the flight became general. A &s;mall body of cho&s;en &s;oldiers, among whom the Elector had fought in per&s;on, &s;till continued to de|fend them&s;elves, and endeavoured to &s;ave their ma&s;ter by retiring into the fore&s;t; but being &s;urrounded on every &s;ide, the Elector, wounded in the face, exhau&s;ted with fatigue, and perceiving all re&s;i&s;tance to be vain, &s;urrendered him&s;elf a pri&s;oner. He was conducted im|mediately towards the Emperor, whom he found ju&s;t returned from the pur&s;uit, &s;tanding on the field of battle in the full exultation of &s;ucce&s;s, and receiving the con|gratulations of his officers, upon this compleat victory obtained by his valour and conduct. Even in &s;uch an unfortunate and humbling &s;ituation, the Elector's beha|viour was equally magnanimous and decent. Sen&s;ible of his condition, he approached his conqueror without any of the fullenne&s;s or pride, which would have been improper in a captive; and con&s;cious of his own digni|ty, he de&s;cended to no mean &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, unbecoming the high &s;tation which he held among the German Princes. "The fortune of war," &s;aid he, "has made me your pri&s;oner, mo&s;t gracious Emperor, and I hope to be treated"&mdash;Here, Charles har&s;hly interrupted him. "And am I then, at la&s;t, acknowledged to be Empe|ror; Charles of Ghent was the only title you lately al|lowed me. You &s;hall be treated as you de&s;erve." At the&s;e words, he turned from him abruptly, with an haughty air. To this cruel repul&s;e, the King of the Ro|mans added reproaches in his own name, u&s;ing expre&s;|&s;ions &s;till more ungenerous and in&s;ulting. The Elector made no reply; but, with an unaltered countenance, which di&s;covered neither a&s;toni&s;hment nor dejection, accompanied the Spani&s;h &s;oldiers appointed to guard him <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Sleid hi&s;t. 426.

in the pur&s;uit, and a great number taken pri&s;oners. About four hundred kept in a body, and e&s;caped to Wittemberg, together with the Electoral Prince, who had likewi&s;e been wounded in the action. After re&s;ting two days on the field of battle, partly to refre&s;h his ar|my, and partly to receive the deputies of the adjacent towns, which were impatient to &s;ecure his protection by &s;ubmitting to his will, the Emperor began to move to|wards Wittemberg, that he might terminate the war at once, by the reduction of that city. The unfortunate Elector was carried along in a &s;ort of triumph, and ex|po&s;ed every where as a captive, to his own &s;ubjects; a &s;pectacle extremely afflicting to them, who both ho|noured and loved him; though the in&s;ult was &s;o far from &s;ubduing his firm &s;pirit, that it did not even ruffle the wonted tranquillity and compo&s;ure of his mind.</P>
<P>AS Wittemberg, the re&s;idence, in that age, of the Electoral branch of the Saxon family, was one of the &s;tronge&s;t cities in Germany, and would no be taken, if properly defended, without great difficulty, the Em|peror marched thither with the utmo&s;t di&s;patch, hoping that while the con&s;ternation occa&s;ioned by his victory was &s;till recent, the inhabitants might imitate the ex|ample of their countrymen, and &s;ubmit to his power, as &s;oon as he appeared before their walls. But Sybilla of Cleves, the Elector's wife, a woman no le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed by her abilities than her virtue, in&s;tead of abandoning her&s;elf to tears and lamentation upon her hu&s;band's mi&s;|fortune, endeavoured, by her example as well as exhor|tation, to animate the citizens; and &s;he in&s;pired them with &s;uch re&s;olution, that, when &s;ummoned to &s;urrender, they returned a vigorous an&s;wer, warning the Emperor to behave towards their Sovereign with the re&s;pect due to his rank, as they were determined to treat Albert of Brandenburgh, who was &s;till a pri&s;oner, preci&s;ely in the &s;ame manner that he treated him. The &s;pirit of the in|habitants, no le&s;s than the &s;trength of the city, &s;eemed now to render a &s;iege in form nece&s;&s;ary. After &s;uch a &s;ignal victory it would have been di&s;graceful not to have undertaken it, though at the &s;ame time the Emperor was de&s;titute of every thing requi&s;ite for carrying it on. But Maurice removed all difficulties, by engaging to
<PB N="116" REF="011837_0935_0F9D880430B8CF10">
furni&s;h provi&s;ions, artillery, ammunition, pioneers, and whatever el&s;e &s;hould be needed. Tru&s;ting to this, Charles gave orders to open the trenches before the town. It quickly appeared, that Maurice's eagerne&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">duce the capital of tho&s;e dominions, which he ex|pected as his reward for taking arms again&s;t his kin&s;|man, and de&s;erting the Prote&s;tant cau&s;e, had led him to promi&s;e what exceeded his power to perform. A bat|tering train was, indeed, carried &s;afely down the Elbe from Dre&s;den to Wittemberg; but as Maurice had no &s;ufficient force to pre&s;erve a &s;ecure communication be|tween his territories, and the camp of the be&s;iegers, Count Mansfeldt, who commanded a body of Electoral troops, de&s;troyed a convoy of provi&s;ions and military &s;tores, and di&s;per&s;ed a band of pioneers de&s;tined for the &s;ervice of the Imperiali&s;ts. This put a &s;top to the progre&s;s of the &s;iege, and convinced the Emperor that as he could not rely on Maurice's promi&s;es, recour&s;e ought to be had to &s;ome more expeditious as well as more certain method of getting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town.</P>
<P>THE unfortunate Elector was in his hands, and he was ungenerous and hard-hearted enough to take ad|vantage of this, in order to make an experiment, whe|ther he might not bring about his de&s;ign, by working upon the tenderne&s;s of a wife for her hu&s;band, or upon the piety of children towards their parent. With this view he &s;ummoned Sybilla a &s;econd time to open the gates, letting her know, that if &s;he again refu&s;ed to com|ply, the Elector &s;hould an&s;wer with his head for her ob|&s;tinacy. To convince her that this was not an empty threat, he brought his pri&s;oner to an immediate trial. The proceedings again&s;t him were as irregular, as the &s;tratagem was barbarous. In&s;tead of con&s;ulting the &s;tates of the empire, or remitting the cau&s;e to any court, which, according to the German con&s;titution might have legally taken cognizance of the Elector's crime, he &s;ub|jected the greate&s;t Prince in the empire to the juri&s;dic|tion of a court-martial compo&s;ed of Spani&s;h and Italian officers, and in which the unrelenting Duke of Alva, a fit in&s;trument for any act of violence, pre&s;ided. This &s;trange tribunal founded its charge upon the ban of the empire which had been i&s;&s;ued again&s;t the pri&s;oner, a
<PB N="117" REF="011837_0936_0F9D8804F03B1778">
&s;entence pronounced by the &s;ole authority of the Empe|ror, and de&s;titute of every legal formality which could render it valid; but pre&s;uming him to be thereby ma|nife&s;tly convicted of trea&s;on and rebellion, the court-martial condemned him to &s;uffer death by being beheaded. This decree was intimated to the Elec|tor while amu&s;ing him&s;elf in playing at che&s;s with Er|ne&s;t of Brun&s;wick, his fellow pri&s;oner. He pau&s;ed for a moment, though without any &s;ymptom either of &s;ur|prize or terror; and after taking notice of the irregu|larity as well as inju&s;tice of the Emperor's proceedings: "It is ea&s;y," continued he, "to comprehend his &s;cheme. I mu&s;t die, becau&s;e Wittemberg will not &s;ur|render; and I &s;hall lay down my life with plea&s;ure, if, by that &s;acrifice, I can pre&s;erve the dignity of my hou&s;e, and tran&s;mit to my po&s;terity the inheritance which be|longs to them. Would to God, that this &s;entence may not effect my wife and children more than it inti|midates me! and that they, for the &s;ake of adding a few days to a life already too long, may not renounce honours and territories which they were born to po&s;&s;e&s;s<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Thuan. i. 142.</NOTE>." He then turned to his antagoni&s;t, whom he challenged to continue the game. He played with his u&s;ual atten|tion and ingenuity, and having beat Erne&s;t, expre&s;&s;ed all the &s;atisfaction which is commonly felt on gaining &s;uch victories. After this he withdrew to his own apart|ment, that he might employ the re&s;t of his time in &s;uch religious exerci&s;es as were proper in his &s;ituation <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Struvii corpus 1050.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT was not with the &s;ame indifference, or compo&s;ure, that the account of the Elector's danger was received at Wittemberg. Sybilla, who had &s;upported with &s;uch undaunted fortitude her hu&s;band's misfortunes, while &s;he imagined that they could reach no farther than to dimini&s;h his power or territories, felt all her re&s;olution fail the moment his life was threatened. Solicitous to &s;ave that, &s;he de&s;pi&s;ed every other con&s;ideration; and was willing to make any &s;acrifice in order to appea&s;e an incen&s;ed conqueror. At the &s;ame time, the Duke of Cleves, the Elector of Brandenburgh, and Maurice, to none of whom Charles had communicated the true mo|tives
<PB N="118" REF="011837_0937_0F9D8805B0213678">
of his violent proceedings again&s;t the Elector, in|terceded warmly with him to &s;pare his life. The fir&s;t was prompted to do &s;o merely by compa&s;&s;ion for his &s;i&s;|ter, and regard for his brother-in-law. The two others dreaded the univer&s;al reproach that they would incur, if, after having boa&s;ted &s;o often of the ample &s;ecurity which the Emperor had promi&s;ed them with re&s;pect to their religion, the fir&s;t effect of their union with him &s;hould be the public execution of a Prince, who was ju&s;tly held in reverence as the mo&s;t zealous protector of the Prote|&s;tant cau&s;e. Maurice, in particular, fore&s;aw that he mu&s;t become the object of dete&s;tation to the Saxons, and could never hope to govern them with tranquillity, if he were con&s;idered by them as acce&s;&s;ary to the death of his neare&s;t kin&s;man, in order that he might obtain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his dominions.</P>
<P>WHILE they, from &s;uch various motives, &s;olicited Charles with the mo&s;t earne&s;t importunity, not to exe|cute the &s;entence, Sybilla, and the re&s;t of the Elector's family, conjured him by letters as well as me&s;&s;engers to &s;cruple at no conce&s;&s;ions that would extricate him out of the pre&s;ent danger, and deliver them from their fears and angui&s;h on his account. The Emperor, perceiving that the expedient which he had tried began to produce the effect he intended, fell by degrees from his former rigour, and allowed him&s;elf to &s;often into promi&s;es of clemency and forgivene&s;s, if the Elector would &s;hew him&s;elf worthy of his favour by &s;ubmitting to rea&s;on|able terms. The Elector, on whom the con&s;ideration of what he might &s;uffer him&s;elf had made no impre&s;&s;ion, was melted by the tears of a wife whom he loved, and could not re&s;i&s;t the entreaties of his family. In com|pliance with their repeated &s;olicitations, he agreed to ar|ticles of accommodation, which he would otherwi&s;e have rejected with di&s;dain. The chief of them were, That he &s;hould re&s;ign the Electoral dignity, as well for him&s;elf as for his po&s;terity, into the Emperor's hands, to be di&s;po&s;ed of entirely at his plea&s;ure; that he &s;hould in&s;tantly put the Imperial troops in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ci|ties of Wittemberg and Gotha; that he &s;hould &s;et Al|bert of Brandenburgh at liberty without ran&s;om; that he &s;hould &s;ubmit to the decrees of the Imperial chamber,

and acquie&s;ce in whatever reformation the Emperor &s;hould make in the con&s;titution of that court; that he &s;hould renounce all leagues again&s;t the Emperor or King of the Romans, and enter into no alliance, for the future, in which they were not comprehended. In return for the&s;e important conce&s;&s;ions, the Emperor promi&s;ed not only to &s;pare his life, but to &s;ettle on him and his po&s;terity the city of Gotha and its territories, together with an an|nual pen&s;ion of fifty thou&s;and florins, payable out of the revenues of the electorate; and likewi&s;e to grant him a &s;um in ready money to be applied towards the di&s;charge of his debts. Even the&s;e articles of grace were clogged with the mortifying condition of his remaining the Em|peror's pri&s;oner during the re&s;t of his life<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 427. Thuan. i. 142. Du Mont Corps Diplom. iv. p. 11, 332.</NOTE>. To the whole, Charles had &s;ubjoined, that he &s;hould &s;ubmit to the decrees of the Pope and council with regard to the controverted points in religion; but the Elector, though he had been per&s;uaded to &s;acrifice all the objects which men commonly hold to be the deare&s;t and mo&s;t valuable, was inflexible with regard to this point; and neither threats nor intreaties could prevail to make him renounce what he deemed to be truth, or per&s;uaded him to act in oppo&s;ition to the dictates of his con&s;cience.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as the Saxon garri&s;on marched out of Wit|temberg, the Emperor fulfilled his engagements to Maurice; and in reward for his merit in having de&s;erted the Prote&s;tant cau&s;e, and having contributed with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s towards the di&s;&s;olution of the Smalkaldic league, he gave him po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that city, together with all the other towns in the electorate. It was not without reluctance, however, that he made &s;uch a &s;acrifice; the extraordinary &s;ucce&s;s of his arms had begun to operate, in its u&s;ual manner, upon his ambitious mind, &s;ugge&s;t|ing new and va&s;t projects for the aggrandizement of his family, towards the accompli&s;hment of which the re|taining of Saxony would have been of the utmo&s;t con&s;e|quence. But as this &s;cheme was not then ripe for exe|cution, he dur&s;t not yet venture to di&s;clo&s;e it; nor would it have been either &s;afe or prudent to have offended

Maurice, at that juncture, by &s;uch a manife&s;t violation of all the promi&s;es, which had &s;educed him to abandon his natural allies.</P>
<P>THE Landgrave, Maurice's father-in-law, was &s;till in arms; and though now left alone to maintain the Prote&s;tant cau&s;e, was neither a feeble nor contemptible enemy. His dominions were of con&s;iderable extent; his &s;ubjects animated with zeal for the Reformation; and if he could have held the Imperiali&s;ts at bay for a &s;hort time, he had much to hope from a party who&s;e &s;trength was &s;till unbroken, who&s;e union as well as vi|gour might return, and which had rea&s;on to depend, with certainty, on being effectually &s;upported by the King of France. The Landgrave thought not of any thing &s;o bold or adventurous; but being &s;eized with the &s;ame con&s;ternation which had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his a&s;&s;ociates, he was intent, only, how to procure favour|able terms from the Emperor, whom he viewed as a conqueror, to who&s;e will there was a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ub|mitting. Maurice encouraged this tame and pacific &s;pi|rit, by magnifying, on the one hand, the Emperor's power; by boa&s;ting, on the other, of his own intere&s;t with his victorious ally; and by repre&s;enting the advan|tageous conditions which he could not fail of obtaining by his interce&s;&s;ion for a friend, whom he was &s;o &s;olici|tous to &s;ave. Sometimes, the Landgrave was induced to place &s;uch unbounded confidence in his promi&s;es, that he was impatient to bring matters to a final accom|modation. On other occa&s;ions, the Emperor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s exorbi|tant ambition, re&s;trained neither by the &s;cruples of de|cency, nor the maxims of ju&s;tice, together with the re|cent and &s;hocking proof which he had given of this in the cruel and oppre&s;&s;ive treatment of the Elector of Sax|ony, came &s;o full into his thoughts, and made &s;uch a lively impre&s;&s;ion on them, that he broke off abruptly the negociations which he had begun; &s;eeming to be convinced that it was more prudent to depend for &s;afe|ty on his own arms, than to confide in Charles's ge|nero&s;ity. But this bold re&s;olution, which de&s;pair had &s;ugge&s;ted to an impatient &s;pirit, fretted by di&s;appoint|ments, was not of long continuance.

<P>MAURICE <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Elector of Brandenburgh, acted as mediators between him and the Emperor; and after all that the former had vaunted of his influence, the condi|tions pre&s;cribed to the Landgrave were extremely rigo|rous. The articles with regard to his renouncing the league of Smalkalde, acknowledging the Emperor's au|thority, and &s;ubmitting to the decrees of the Imperial chamber, were the &s;ame which had been impo&s;ed on the Elector of Saxony. Be&s;ides the&s;e, he was required to &s;urrender his per&s;on and territories to the Emperor; to implore for pardon on his knees; to pay an hundred and fifty thou&s;and crowns towards defraying the ex|pences of the war; to demoli&s;h the fortifications of all the towns in his dominions, except one; to oblige the garri&s;on which he placed in it to take an oath of fidelity to the Emperor; to allow a free pa&s;&s;age through his ter|ritories to the Imperial troops as often as it &s;hall be de|manded; to deliver up all his artillery and ammunition to the Emperor; to &s;et at liberty, without ran&s;om, Henry of Brun&s;wick, together with the other pri&s;oners he had taken during the war; and neither to take arms him&s;elf, for the future, nor to permit any of his &s;ubjects to &s;erve again&s;t the Emperor or his allies <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 430.

<P>THE Landgrave ratified the&s;e articles, though with the utmo&s;t reluctance, as they contained no &s;tipulation with regard to the manner in which he was to be treated, and left him entirely at the Emperor's mercy. Nece&s;&s;ity, however, compelled him to give his a&s;&s;ent. Charles, who had a&s;&s;umed the haughty and imperious tone of a conqueror, ever &s;ince the reduction of Saxony, in&s;i&s;ted on an unconditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and would permit no|thing to be added to the terms which he had pre&s;cribed, that could in any degree limit the fulne&s;s of his power, or re&s;train him from behaving as he &s;aw meet, towards a Prince whom he regarded as ab&s;olutely at his di&s;po&s;al. But though he would not vouch&s;afe to negociate with the Landgrave, on &s;uch a footing of equality, as to &s;uf|fer

any article to be in&s;erted among tho&s;e which he had dictated to him, that could be con&s;idered as a formal &s;tipulation for the &s;ecurity and freedom of his per&s;on; he, or his mini&s;ters in his name, gave the Elector of Brandenburgh and Maurice &s;uch full &s;atisfaction with regard to this point, that they a&s;&s;ured the Landgrave, that Charles would behave to him in the &s;ame way that he had done to the Duke of Wurtemberg, and would allow him, as &s;oon as he had made his &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, to re|turn to his own territories. Upon finding the Land|grave to be &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with his former &s;u&s;picions of the Emperor's intentions, and unwilling to tru&s;t verbal or ambiguous declarations, in a matter of &s;uch e&s;&s;ential concern as his own liberty, they &s;ent him a bond &s;igned by them both, containing the mo&s;t &s;olemn obligations, that if any violence what&s;oever were offered to his per|&s;on, during his interview with the Emperor, they would in&s;tantly &s;urrender them&s;elves to his &s;ons, and remain in their hands, to be treated by them in the &s;ame manner as the Emperor &s;hould treat him <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Du Mont Corps Diplom. iv. p. 11, 336.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS, together with the indi&s;pen&s;able obligation of performing what was contained in the articles of which he had accepted, removed his doubts and &s;cruples, or made it nece&s;&s;ary to get over them. He repaired, for that purpo&s;e, to the Imperial camp at Hall in Saxony, where a circum&s;tance occurred which revived his &s;u&s;pi|cions and increa&s;ed his fears. Ju&s;t as he was about to enter the chamber of pre&s;ence, in order to make his public &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Emperor, a copy of the articles which he had approved of was put into his hands, in order that he might ratify them anew. Upon peru&s;ing them, he perceived that the Imperial mini&s;ters had add|ed two new articles; one importing, that if an di&s;pute &s;hould ari&s;e concerning the meaning of the former con|ditions, the Emperor &s;hould have the right of putting what interpretation upon them he thought mo&s;t rea&s;on|able; the other, that the Landgrave was bound to &s;ub|mit implicitly to the deci&s;ions of the council of Trent. This unworthy artifice, calculated to &s;urprize him into an approbation of articles, to which he had not the mo&s;t

With &s;ome diffi|culty, the Elector of Brandenburgh and Maurice pre|vailed at length on the Emperor's mini&s;ters to drop the former article as unju&s;t, and to explain the latter in &s;uch a manner, that he could agree to it, without openly re|nouncing the Prote&s;tant religion.</P>
<P>THIS ob&s;tacle being &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mounted, the Landgrave was impatient to fini&s;h a ceremony, which, how mortifying &s;oever, had been declared nece&s;&s;ary towards his obtain|ing pardon. The Emperor was &s;eated on a magnificent throne, with all the en&s;igns of his dignity, &s;urrounded by a numerous train of the Princes of the empire, among whom was Henry of Brun&s;wick, lately the Landgrave's pri&s;oner, and now, by a &s;udden rever&s;e of fortune, a &s;pectator of his humiliation. The Landgrave was in|troduced with great &s;olemnity, and advancing towards the throne, fell upon his knees. His chancellor, who walked behind him, immediately read, by his ma&s;ter's command, a paper which contained an humble confe&s;|&s;ion of the crime whereof he had been guilty; an ac|knowledgment, that he had merited, on that account, the mo&s;t &s;evere puni&s;hment; an ab&s;olute re&s;ignation of him&s;elf and his dominions, to be di&s;po&s;ed of at the Em|peror's plea&s;ure; a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive petition for pardon, his hopes of which were founded entirely on the Emperor's clemency; and it concluded, with promi&s;es of behaving, for the future, like a &s;ubject, who&s;e principles of loyalty and obedience would be confirmed, and would even de|rive new force from the &s;entiments of gratitude which mu&s;t hereafter fill and animate his heart. While the chancellor was reading this abject declaration, the eyes of all the &s;pectators were fixed on the unfortunate Land|grave; few could behold a Prince, &s;o powerful as well as high-&s;pirited, &s;uing for mercy in the po&s;ture of a &s;uppliant, without being touched with commi&s;eration, and perceiving &s;erious reflections ari&s;e in their minds upon the in&s;tability and emptine&s;s of human grandeur.
<PB N="124" REF="011837_0943_0F9D880A30D795F8">
The Emperor viewed the whole tran&s;action with an haughty, unfeeling compo&s;ure; and pre&s;erving a pro|found &s;ilence him&s;elf, made a &s;ign to one of his &s;ecre|taries to read his an&s;wer; the tenor of which was, That though he might have ju&s;tly inflicted on him the griev|ous puni&s;hment which his crimes de&s;erved, yet, prompt|ed by his own genero&s;ity, moved by the &s;olicitations of &s;everal Princes in behalf of the Landgrave, and influ|enced by his penetential acknowledgments, he would not deal with him according to the rigour of ju&s;tice, and would &s;ubject him to no penalty which was not &s;pe|cified in the articles that he had already &s;ub&s;cribed. The moment the &s;ecretary had fini&s;hed, Charles turned away abruptly without deigning to give the unhappy &s;uppliant any &s;ign of compa&s;&s;ion or reconcilement. He did not even de&s;ire him to ri&s;e from his knees; which the Landgrave having ventured to do unbidden, ad|vanced towards the Emperor with an intention to ki&s;s his hand, flattering him&s;elf, that his guilt being now fully expiated, he might pre&s;ume to take that liberty. B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Elector of Brandenburgh perceiving that this familiarity would be offen&s;ive to the Emperor, inter|po&s;ed, and de&s;ired the Landgrave to go along with him and Maurice to the Duke of Alva's apartments in the ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>HE was received and entertained by that nobleman with the re&s;pect and courte&s;y due to &s;uch a gue&s;t. But, after &s;upper, while he was engaged in play, the Duke took the Elector and Maurice a&s;ide, and communicated to them the Emperor's orders, that the Landgrave mu&s;t remain a pri&s;oner in that place under the cu&s;tody of a Spani&s;h guard. As they had not hitherto entertained the mo&s;t di&s;tant &s;u&s;picion of the Emperor's &s;incerity and rectitude of intention, their &s;urprize was exce&s;&s;ive, and their indignation not inferior to it, on di&s;covering how greatly they had been deceived them&s;elves, and how in|famou&s;ly abu&s;ed in having been made the in&s;truments of deceiving and ruining their friend. They had recour&s;e to complaints, to arguments, and to intreaties, in order to &s;ave them&s;elves from that di&s;grace, and to extricate him out of the wretched &s;ituation into which he had been betrayed by too great confidence in them. But the

Duke of Alva remained inflexible, and pleaded the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of executing the Emperor's commands. By this time it grew late, and the Landgrave, who knew no|thing of what had pa&s;&s;ed, nor dreaded the &s;nare in which he was entangled, prepared for departing, when the fatal orders were intimated to him. He was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> dumb at fir&s;t with a&s;toni&s;hment, but after being &s;ilent a few moments, he broke out into all the violent ex|pre&s;&s;ions which horror at inju&s;tice, accompanied with fraud, naturally &s;ugge&s;ts. He complained, he expo&s;tu|lated, he exclaimed; &s;ometimes inveighing again&s;t the Emperor's artifices as unworthy of a great and generous Prince; &s;ometimes cen&s;uring the credulity of his friends in tru&s;ting to Charles's in&s;idious promi&s;es; &s;ometimes charging them with meanne&s;s in &s;tooping to lend their a&s;&s;i&s;tance towards the execution of &s;uch a perfidious and di&s;honourable &s;cheme; and in the end, he required them to remember their engagements to his children, and in|&s;tantly to fulfil them. They, after giving way for a little to the torrent of his pa&s;&s;ion, &s;olemnly a&s;&s;erted their own innocence and upright intention in the whole tran&s;|action, and encouraged him to hope, that as &s;oon as they &s;aw the Emperor, they would obtain redre&s;s of an injury which affected their own honour, no le&s;s than it did his liberty. At the &s;ame time, in order to &s;ooth his rage and impatience, Maurice remained with him during the night, in the apartment where he was confined <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 433.

<P>NEXT morning, the Elector and Maurice applied jointly to the Emperor, repre&s;enting the infamy to which they would be expo&s;ed throughout Germany, if the Landgrave was detained in cu&s;tody; that they would not have advi&s;ed, nor would he him&s;elf have con|&s;ented to an interview, if they had &s;u&s;pected that the lo&s;s of his liberty was to be the con&s;equence of his &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion; that they were bound to procure his relea&s;e, hav|ing plighted their faith to that effect, and engaged their own per&s;ons as &s;ureties for his.

had the mortification to find, that their former ob&s;equi|ou&s;ne&s;s was forgotten, and little regard paid to their in|terce&s;&s;ion. He was ignorant, he told them, of their par|ticular or private tran&s;actions with the Landgrave, nor was his conduct to be regulated by the&s;e; though he knew well what he him&s;elf had promi&s;ed, which was not that the Landgrave &s;hould be exempt from all re|&s;traint, but that he &s;hould not be kept a pri&s;oner during life <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">According to &s;everal hi&s;torians of great name, the Emperor, in his treaty with the Landgrave, &s;tipulated that he would not de|tain him in any pri&s;on. But in executing the deed, which was written in the German tongue, the Imperial mini&s;ters fraudulent|ly &s;ub&s;tituted the word <HI>ewiger</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>einiger,</HI> and thus the treaty, in place of a promi&s;e, that he &s;hould not be detained in <HI>any</HI> pri&s;on, contained only an engagement, that he &s;hould not be detained in perpetual impri&s;onment. But authors, eminent for hi&s;torical knowledge and critical accuracy, have called in que&s;tion the truth of this common &s;tory. The &s;ilence of Sleidan with regard to it, as well as its not being mentioned in the various memorials which he has publi&s;hed concerning the Landgrave's impri&s;onment, great|ly favour this opinion. But as &s;everal books which contain the information nece&s;&s;ary towards di&s;cu&s;&s;ing this point, with accuracy, are written in the German language, which I do not under&s;tand, I cannot pretend to enquire into this matter with the &s;ame accuracy with which I have endeavoured to &s;ettle &s;ome other controverted facts that have occurred in the cour&s;e of this hi&s;tory.

Having &s;aid this with a peremptory and deci&s;ive tone, he put an end to the conference; and they &s;eeing no probability, at that time, of making any impre&s;&s;ion upon the Emperor, who &s;eemed to have taken his re&s;o|lution deliberately, and to be ob&s;tinately bent on adhe|ring to it, were obliged to acquaint the unfortunate pri|&s;oner with the ill &s;ucce&s;s of their endeavours in his be|half. This di&s;appointment threw him into a new and more violent tran&s;port of rage, &s;o that to prevent his pro|ceeding to &s;ome de&s;perate extremity, the Elector and Maurice promi&s;ed, that they would not quit the Em|peror, until, by the frequency and fervour of their im|portunity, they had extorted his con&s;ent to &s;et him free. They accordingly renewed their &s;olicitations a few days afterwards, but found Charles more haughty and un|tractable than before, and were warned, that if they touched again upon a &s;ubject &s;o di&s;agreeable, and with

regard to which he had determined to hear nothing far|ther, he would in&s;tantly give orders to convey the pri|&s;oner into Spain. Afraid of hurting the Landgrave by an officious or ill-timed zeal to &s;erve him, they not only de&s;i&s;ted, but left the court, and as they did not choo&s;e to meet the fir&s;t &s;allies of the Landgrave's rage upon his learning the cau&s;e of their departure, they informed him of it by a letter, wherein they exhorted him to fulfil all that he had promi&s;ed to the Emperor, as the mo&s;t certain means of procuring a &s;peedy relea&s;e.</P>
<P>WHATEVER violent emotions their abandoning his cau&s;e in this manner occa&s;ioned, his impatience to re|cover liberty made him follow their advice. He paid the &s;um which had been impo&s;ed on him, ordered his fortre&s;&s;es to be razed, and renounced all alliances that could give offence. This prompt compliance with the will of the conqueror produced no effect. He was &s;till guarded with the &s;ame vigilant &s;everity; and being car|ried about, with the degraded Elector of Saxony, where|ever the Emperor went, their di&s;grace and his triumph was each day renewed. The fortitude and equanimity with which the Elector bore the&s;e repeated in&s;ults, were not more remarkable than the Landgrave's fretfulne&s;s and impatience. His active impetuous mind could ill brook re&s;traint; and reflection upon the &s;hameful arti|fices by which he had been decoyed into that &s;ituation, as well as indignation at the inju&s;tice with which he was &s;till detained in it, drove him often to the wilde&s;t ex|ce&s;&s;es of pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE people of the different cities, to whom Charles thus wantonly expo&s;ed the&s;e illu&s;trious pri&s;oners as a public &s;pectacle, were &s;en&s;ibly touched with &s;uch an in|&s;ult offered to the Germanic body, and murmured loud|ly at this indecent treatment of two of its greate&s;t Princes. They had &s;oon other cau&s;es of complaint, and &s;uch as affected them more nearly. Charles proceeded to add oppre&s;&s;ion to in&s;ult, and arrogating to him&s;elf all the rights of a conqueror, exerci&s;ed them with the ut|mo&s;t rigour. He ordered his troops to &s;eize the artil|lery and military &s;tores belonging to &s;uch as had been members of the Smalkaldic league, and having collected upwards of five hundred pieces of cannon, a great num|ber

in that age, he &s;ent part of them into the Low-Coun|tries, part into Italy, and part into Spain, in order to &s;pread, by this means, the fame of his &s;ucce&s;s, and that they might &s;erve as monuments of his having &s;ubdued a nation, hitherto deemed invincible. He then levied, by his &s;ole authority, large &s;ums as well upon tho&s;e who had &s;erved him with fidelity during the war, as upon &s;uch as had been in arms again&s;t him; upon the former, as their contingent towards a war, which having been undertaken, as he pretended, for the common benefit, ought to be carried on at the common charge; upon the latter, as a fine by way of puni&s;hment for their re|bellion. By the&s;e exactions he ama&s;&s;ed above one mil|lion &s;ix hundred thou&s;and crowns, a &s;um which appeared prodigious in the &s;ixteenth century. But &s;o general was the con&s;ternation which had &s;eized the Germans upon his rapid &s;ucce&s;s, and &s;uch their dread of his victorious troops, that all implicitly obeyed his commands; though, at the &s;ame time, the&s;e extraordinary &s;tretches of power greatly alarmed a people, jealous of their pri|vileges, and habituated during &s;everal ages to con&s;ider the Imperial authority as neither exten&s;ive nor formi|dable. This di&s;content and re&s;entment, how indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly &s;oever they concealed them, became univer&s;al; and the more the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions were re&s;trained and kept down for the pre&s;ent, the more likely were they to bur&s;t out &s;oon with additional violence.</P>
<P>WHILE Charles gave law to the Germans like a con|quered people, Ferdinand treated his &s;ubjects in Bohe|mia with &s;till greater rigour. That kingdom po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed privileges and immunities as exten&s;ive as tho&s;e of any nation in which the feudal in&s;titutions were e&s;tabli&s;hed. The prerogative of their Kings was extremely limited, and the crown it&s;elf elective. Ferdinand, when placed on the throne, had confirmed their liberties with every &s;olemnity pre&s;cribed by their exce&s;&s;ive &s;olicitude for the &s;ecurity of a con&s;titution of government to which they were extremely attached. He &s;oon began, however, to be weary of a juri&s;diction &s;o much circum&s;cribed, and to de&s;pi&s;e a &s;ceptre which he could not tran&s;mit to his po|&s;terity; and notwith&s;tanding all his former engage|ments, he attempted to overturn the con&s;titution from
<PB N="129" REF="011837_0948_0F9D880DF0935D20">
its foundations; that in&s;tead of an elective kingdom he might render it hereditary. But the Bohemians &s;eemed re&s;olved not to relinqui&s;h, tamely, privileges which they had long enjoyed. At the &s;ame time, many of them having embraced the doctrines of the Reformers, the &s;eeds of which John Hu&s;s and Jerome of Prague had planted in their country about the beginning of the preceding cen|tury, the de&s;ire of acquiring religious liberty mingled it&s;elf with their zeal for their civil rights; and the&s;e two kindred pa&s;&s;ions heightening, as u&s;ual, each other's force, precipitated them immediately into violent mea|&s;ures. They had not only refu&s;ed to &s;erve their Sove|reign again&s;t the confederates of Smalkalde, but having entered into a clo&s;e alliance with the Elector of Saxony, they bound them&s;elves, by a &s;olemn a&s;&s;ociation, to de|fend their antient con&s;titution; and to per&s;i&s;t, until they &s;hould obtain &s;uch additional grants as they thought ne|ce&s;&s;ary towards perfecting the pre&s;ent model of their go|vernment, or rendering it more permanent. They cho&s;e Ca&s;par Phlug, a nobleman of di&s;tinction, to be their ge|neral; and levied an army of thirty thou&s;and men to enforce their petitions. But either from the weakne&s;s of their leader, or from the di&s;&s;en&s;ions in a great un|wieldy body, which having united ha&s;tily, was not tho|roughly compacted, or from &s;ome other unknown cau&s;e, the &s;ub&s;equent operations of the Bohemians bore no proportion to the zeal and ardour with which they took their fir&s;t re&s;olutions. They &s;uffered them&s;elves to be amu&s;ed &s;o long with negociations and overtures of dif|ferent kinds, that before they could enter Saxony, the battle of Muhlberg was fought, the Elector deprived of his dignity and territories, the Landgrave confined to clo&s;e cu&s;tody, and the league of Smalkalde entirely di&s;&s;ipated. The &s;ame dread of the Emperor's power which had &s;eized the re&s;t of the Germans, reached them. As &s;oon as their Sovereign approached with a body of Imperial troops, they in&s;tantly di&s;per&s;ed, thinking of no|thing but how to atone for their pa&s;t guilt, and to ac|quire &s;ome hope of forgivene&s;s, by a prompt &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. But Ferdinand, who entered his dominions full of that implacable re&s;entment which inflames Monarchs who&s;e authority has been de&s;pi&s;ed, was not to be molified by
<PB N="130" REF="011837_0949_0F9D880EB1F1A8E8">
the late repentance and involuntary return of rebellious &s;ubjects to their duty. He even heard, unmoved, the intreaties and tears of the citizens of Prague, who ap|peared before him in the po&s;ture of &s;uppliants, and im|plored for mercy. The &s;entence which he pronounced again&s;t them was rigorous to extremity; he aboli&s;hed many of their privileges, he abridged others, and new-modelled the con&s;titution according to his plea&s;ure. He puni&s;hed many of tho&s;e who had been mo&s;t active in forming the late a&s;&s;ociation again&s;t him with death, and &s;till a greater number with confi&s;cation of their goods, or perpetual bani&s;hment. He obliged all his &s;ubjects, of every condition, to give up their arms to be depo|&s;ited in forts where he planted garri&s;ons; and after di&s;|arming his people, he loaded them with new and exor|bitant taxes. Thus, by an ill conducted and un&s;ucce&s;s|ful effort to extend their privileges, the Bohemians not only enlarged the &s;phere of the royal prerogative which they intended to have circum&s;cribed, but they almo&s;t annihilated tho&s;e liberties which they aimed at e&s;tabli&s;h|ing on a broader and more &s;ecure foundation <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 408, 419, 434.

<P>THE Emperor, having now humbled, and, as he imagined, &s;ubdued the independent and &s;tubborn &s;pirit of the Germans, by the terror of arms and the rigour of puni&s;hment, held a Diet at Au&s;burg, in order to com|po&s;e finally the controver&s;ies with regard to religion, which had &s;o long di&s;turbed the empire. He dur&s;t not, however, tru&s;t the determination of a matter &s;o intere&s;t|ing to the free &s;uffrage of the Germans, broken as their minds now were to &s;ubjection. He entered the city at the head of his Spani&s;h troops, and a&s;&s;igned them quar|ters there. The re&s;t of his &s;oldiers he cantoned in the adjacent villages; &s;o that the members of the Diet, while they carried on their deliberations, were &s;urrounded by the &s;ame army which had overcome their countrymen. Immediately after his public entry, Charles gave a proof of the violence with which he intended to proceed. He took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by force of the cathedral, together with one of the principal churches; and his prie&s;ts having, by various ceremonies, purified them from the pollution
<PB N="131" REF="011837_0950_0F9D880F7373C4A8">
with which they &s;uppo&s;ed the unhallowed mini&s;trations of the Prote&s;tants to have defiled them, they re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ed with great pomp the rites of the Romi&s;h wor&s;hip <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 435, 437.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE concour&s;e of members to this Diet was extraor|dinary; the importance of the affairs concerning which it was to deliberate, and the fear of giving offence to the Emperor by an ab&s;ence which lay open to mi&s;con|&s;truction, brought together almo&s;t all the Princes, nobles and repre&s;entatives of cities who had right to &s;it in that a&s;&s;embly. The Emperor, in the &s;peech with which he opened the meeting, called their attention im|mediately to the point, which &s;eemed chiefly to merit it. Having mentioned the fatal effects of the religious di&s;&s;en&s;ions which had ari&s;en in Germany, and taken no|tice of his own unwearied endeavours to procure a ge|neral council, which alone could provide a remedy ade|quate to the&s;e evils, he exhorted them to recognize its authority, and to &s;tand to the award of an a&s;&s;embly, to which they had originally appealed, as having the &s;ole right of judgment in the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT the council, to which Charles wi&s;hed them to re|fer all their controver&s;ies, had, by this time, undergone a violent change. The fear and jealou&s;y, with which the Emperor's fir&s;t &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t the confederates of Smalkalde had in&s;pired the Pope, continued to increa&s;e. Not &s;atisfied with attempting to retard the progre&s;s of the Imperial arms, by the &s;udden recal of his troops, Paul began to con&s;ider the Emper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> as an enemy, the weight of who&s;e power he mu&s;t &s;oon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">el, and again&s;t whom he could not be too ha&s;ty in taking precautions. He fore|&s;aw that the immediate effect of the Emperor's acquiring ab&s;olute power in Germany, would be to render him en|tirely ma&s;ter of all the deci&s;ions of the council, if it &s;hould continue to meet in Trent. It was dangerous to allow a Monarch, &s;o ambitious, to get the command of this formidable engine, which he might employ at plea|&s;ure to limit or overturn the papal authority. As the only method of preventing this, he determined to tran&s;|late the council to &s;ome city more immediately under his own juri&s;diction, and at a greater di&s;tance from the
<PB N="132" REF="011837_0951_0F9D881030FD36C8">
terror of the Emperor's arms, or the reach of his influ|ence. An incident fortunately occurred which gave this mea&s;ure the appearance of being nece&s;&s;ary. One or two of the fathers of the council, together with &s;ome of their dome&s;tics, happening to die &s;uddenly, the phy&s;icians, deceived by the &s;ymptoms, or &s;uborned by the Pope's legates, pronounced the di&s;temper to be infectious and pe&s;tilential. Some of the prelates, &s;truck with a panic, retired; others were impatient to be gone; and after a &s;hort con&s;ultation, the council was tran&s;lated to Bologna, a city &s;ubject to the Pope. All the bi&s;hops in the Im|perial intere&s;t, warmly oppo&s;ed this re&s;olution, as taken without nece&s;&s;ity, and founded on fal&s;e or frivolous pre|texts. All the Spani&s;h prelates, and mo&s;t of the Nea|politan, by the Emperor's expre&s;s command, remained at Trent; the re&s;t, to the number of thirty-four, ac|companying the legates to Bologna. Thus a &s;chi&s;m commenced, in that very a&s;&s;embly, which had been call|ed to heal the divi&s;ions of Chri&s;tendom; the fathers of Bologna inveighing again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;taid at Trent, as contumacious and regardle&s;s of the Pope's authority; while the others accu&s;ed them of being &s;o far intimidated by the fears of imaginary danger, as to remove to a place where their con&s;ultations could prove of no &s;er|vice towards re-e&s;tabli&s;hing peace and order in Ger|many <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">F. Paul, 248, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Emperor, at the &s;ame time, employed all his intere&s;t to procure the return of the council to Trent, But Paul, who highly applauded his own &s;agacity in having taken a &s;tep which put it out of Charles's power to acquire the direction of that a&s;&s;embly, paid no regard to a reque&s;t&punc; the object of which was &s;o extremely ob|vious. The &s;ummer was con&s;umed in fruitle&s;s nego|ciations with re&s;pect to this point, the importunity of the one, and the ob&s;tinacy of the other daily increa&s;ing. At la&s;t, an event happened which widened the breach irreparably, and rendered the Pope utterly aver&s;e from li&s;tening to any propo&s;al that came from the Emperor. Charles, as has been already ob&s;erved, had &s;o violently exa&s;perated Peter Lewis Farne&s;e, the Pope's &s;on, by
<PB N="133" REF="011837_0952_0F9D8811747CEB90">
refu&s;ing to grant him the inve&s;titure of Parma and Pla|centia, that he had watched ever &s;ince that time with all the vigilance of re&s;entment for an opportunity of re|venging that injury. He had endeavoured to precipi|tate his father into open ho&s;tilities again&s;t the Emperor, and had earne&s;tly &s;olicited the King of France to in|vade Italy. His hatred and re&s;entment extended to all tho&s;e whom he knew that the Emperor favoured; he per&s;ecuted Gonzaga, governor of Milan, with ill of|fices, and had encouraged Fie&s;co in his attempt upon the life of Andrew Doria, becau&s;e both Gonzaga and Doria po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a great degree of the Emperor's e&s;teem and confidence. His malevolence and &s;ecret intrigues were not unknown to the Emperor, who could not be more de&s;irous to take vengeance on him, than Gonzaga and Doria were to be employed as his in&s;truments in inflicting it. Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne&s;e, by the profligacy of his life, and by enormities of every kind, equal to tho&s;e committed by the wor&s;t tyrants who have di&s;graced human nature, had rendered him&s;elf &s;o odious, that they thought any violence whatever&punc; might be attempted again&s;t him. They &s;oon found among his own &s;ubjects, per&s;ons who were eager, and even deemed it meritorious to lend their hands in &s;uch a &s;ervice. As he, animated with the jealou&s;y which u&s;ually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es petty Sovereigns, had employed all the cruelty and fraud, whereby they endeavour to &s;upply their defect of power, in order to humble and extirpate the nobility &s;ubject to his govern|ment, five noblemen of the greate&s;t di&s;tinction in Pla|centia, combined to avenge the injuries, which they them&s;elves had &s;uffered, as well as tho&s;e which he had offered to their order. They formed their plan in con|junction with Gonzaga; but it remains uncertain whe|ther he originally &s;ugge&s;ted the &s;cheme to them, or on|ly approved of what they propo&s;ed, and co-operated in carrying it on. They concerted all the previous &s;teps with &s;uch fore&s;ight, conducted their intrigues with &s;uch &s;ecrecy, and di&s;played &s;uch courage in the execution of their de&s;ign, that it may be ranked among the mo&s;t au|dacious deeds of that nature mentioned in hi&s;tory. One body of the con&s;pirators &s;urprized, at mid-day, the gates of the citadel of Placentia where Farne&s;e re&s;ided, over|powered
<PB N="134" REF="011837_0953_0F9D8811B073EA58">
his guards, and murdered him. Another party of them made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the town, and call|ed upon their fellow-citizens to take arms, in order to rea&s;&s;ume their liberty. The multitude ran towards the citadel, from which three great guns, a &s;ignal concerted with Gonzaga, had been fired; and before they could gue&s;s the cau&s;e or the authors of the tumult, they &s;aw the lifele&s;s body of the tyrant hanging by the heels from one of the windows of the citadel. But &s;o univer&s;ally dete&s;table had he become, that not one expre&s;&s;ed any &s;entiment of concern at &s;uch a &s;ad rever&s;e of fortune, or of indignation at this ignominious treatment of a &s;ove|reign Prince. The exultation at the &s;ucce&s;s of the con|&s;piracy was general, and all applauded the actors in it, as the deliverers of their country. The body was tumbled into the ditch that &s;urrounded the citadel, and expo&s;ed to the in&s;ults of the rabble; the re&s;t of the citizens re|turned to their u&s;ual occupations, as if nothing extraor|dinary had happened.</P>
<P>BEFORE next morning, a body of troops arriving from the frontiers of the Milane&s;e, where they had been po&s;ted in expectation of the event, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the city in the Emperor's name, and rein&s;tated the inhabitants in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their antient privileges. Parma, which the Imperiali&s;ts attempted likewi&s;e to &s;urprize, was &s;aved by the vigilance and fidelity of the officers whom Farne&s;e had intru&s;ted with the command of the garri&s;on. The death of a &s;on whom, notwith&s;tanding his infamous vices, Paul loved with an exce&s;s of parental tenderne&s;s, overwhelmed him with the deepe&s;t affliction; and the lo&s;s of a city, of &s;uch con&s;equence as Placentia, greatly embittered his &s;orrow. He accu&s;ed Gonzaga, in open con&s;i&s;tory, of having com|mitted a cruel murder in order to prepare the way for an unju&s;t u&s;urpation, and immediately demanded of the Emperor &s;atisfaction for both; for the former, by the puni&s;hment of Gonzaga; for the latter by the re&s;titu|tion of Placentia to his grand&s;on Octavio, its rightful owner. But Charles, who, rather than quit a prize of &s;uch value, was willing to expo&s;e him&s;elf to the imputa|tion of being acce&s;&s;ary to the crime which had given an opportunity of &s;eizing it, and to bear the infamy of de|frauding his own &s;on-in-law of the inheritance which be|longed

<P>THIS re&s;olution, flowing from an ambition &s;o rapa|cious, as to be re&s;trained by no con&s;ideration either of decency or ju&s;tice, tran&s;ported the Pope &s;o far beyond his u&s;ual moderation and caution, that he was eager to take arms again&s;t the Emperor in order to be avenged on the murderers of his &s;on, and to recover the inheri|tance wre&s;ted from his family. Con&s;cious, however, of his own inability to contend with &s;uch an enemy, he warmly &s;olicited the French King and the republic of Venice to join in an offen&s;ive league again&s;t Charles. But Henry was intent, at that time, on other objects. His antient allies the Scots, having been defeated by the Engli&s;h in one of the greate&s;t battles ever fought be|tween the&s;e two rival nations, he was about to &s;end a nu|merous body of veteran troops into that country, as well to pre&s;erve it from being conquered, as to gain the acqui&s;ition of a new kingdom to the French monarchy, by marrying his &s;on the Dauphin to the young Queen of Scotland. An undertaking accompanied with &s;uch ma|nife&s;t advantages, the &s;ucce&s;s of which appeared to be &s;o certain, was not to be relinqui&s;hed for the remote pro&s;pect of benefit from an alliance depending upon the precarious life of a Pope of four&s;core, who had nothing at heart but the gratification of his own private re&s;ent|ment. In&s;tead, therefore, of ru&s;hing headlong into the alliance propo&s;ed, Henry amu&s;ed the Pope with &s;uch general profe&s;&s;ions and promi&s;es, as might keep him from any thoughts of endeavouring to accommodate his differences with the Emperor, but at the &s;ame time avoided any &s;uch engagement as might occa&s;ion an im|mediate rupture between Charles and him&s;elf, or preci|pitate him into a war for which he was not prepared. The Venetians, though much alarmed at &s;eeing Placen|tia in the hands of the Imperiali&s;ts, imitated the wary conduct of the French King, which re&s;embled &s;o nearly the &s;pirit with which they them&s;elves u&s;ually carried on their negociations <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Ribier. ii. 63, 71, 78, 85, 95.

<P><PB N="136" REF="011837_0955_0F9D881330C48710">BUT, though the Pope found that it was not in his power to light up immediately the flames of war, he did not forget the injuries, which he was obliged for the pre&s;ent to endure; re&s;entment &s;ettled deeper in his mind, and became more rancorous in proportion as he felt the difficulty of gratifying it. It was, while the&s;e &s;entiments of enmity were in full force, and the de&s;ire of vengeance at its height, that the Diet of Aug&s;burg, by the Emperor's command, petitioned the Pope, in name of the whole Germanic body, to enjoin the pre|lates who had retired to Bologna, to return again to Trent, and to renew their deliberations in that place. Charles had been at great pains in bringing the mem|bers to join in this reque&s;t. Having ob&s;erved a con|&s;iderable variety of &s;entiments among the Prote&s;tants with re&s;pect to the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion which he had required to the decrees of the council, &s;ome of them being alto|gether intractable, while others were ready to acknow|ledge its right of juri&s;diction upon certain conditions, he employed all his addre&s;s in order to gain or to divide them. He threatened and over-awed the Elector Pa|latine, a weak Prince, and obnoxious to vengeance on account of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which he had given to the con|federates of Smalkalde. The hope of procuring liber|ty for the Landgrave, together with the formal confir|mation of his own electoral dignity, overcame Maurice's &s;cruples, or prevented him from oppo&s;ing what he knew would be agreeable to the Emperor. The Elector of Brandenburgh, le&s;s influenced by religious zeal than any Prince of that age, was ea&s;ily induced to imitate their example in a&s;&s;enting to all that the Emperor required. The deputies of the cities remained &s;till to be brought over; they were more tenacious of their principles, and though every thing that could operate either on their hopes or fears was tried, the utmo&s;t that they would promi&s;e was to acknowledge the juri&s;diction of the council, if effectual provi&s;ion were made for &s;ecuring the divines of all parties free acce&s;s to that a&s;&s;embly, with entire liberty of debate; and if all points in con|trover&s;y were decided according to &s;cripture and the u&s;age of the primitive church. But when the memo|rial, containing this declaration, was pre&s;ented to the Em|peror,
<PB N="137" REF="011837_0956_0F9D881480CC6C08">
he ventured to put in practice a very extraordi|nary artifice. Without reading the paper, or taking any notice of the conditions on which they had in&s;i&s;ted, he &s;eemed to take it for granted that they had com|plied with his demand, and gave thanks to the depu|ties for their full and unre&s;erved &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the de|crees of the council. The deputies, though a&s;toni&s;hed at what they had heard, did not attempt to &s;et him right, both parties being better plea&s;ed that the matter &s;hould remain under this &s;tate of ambiguity, than to pu&s;h for an explanation, which mu&s;t have occa&s;ioned a di&s;pute, and would have led, perhaps, to a rupture <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">F.

<P>HAVING obtained this &s;eeming &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the Diet to the authority of the council, Charles employed that as an argument to enforce their petition for its return to Trent. But the Pope, from the &s;atisfaction of morti|fying the Emperor, as well as from his own aver&s;ion to what was demanded, re&s;olved, without he&s;itation, that this petition &s;hould be rejected; though, in order to avoid the imputation of being influenced wholly by re&s;ent|ment, he had the addre&s;s to throw it upon the fathers at Bologna, to put a direct negative upon the reque&s;t. He referred to their con&s;ideration the petition of the Diet, and they, ready to confirm by their a&s;&s;ent what|ever the legates were plea&s;ed to dictate declared, that the council could not, in con&s;i&s;tence with its dignity, re|turn to Trent, unle&s;s the prelates, who, by remaining there, had di&s;covered a &s;chi&s;matic &s;pirit, would fir&s;t re|pair to Bologna, and join their brethren; and that, even after their junction, the council could not renew its con|&s;ultations with any pro&s;pect of benefit to the church, if the Germans did not prove their intention of obeying its future decrees to be &s;incere, by yielding immediate obedience to tho&s;e which it had already pa&s;&s;ed <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">F.

<P>THIS an&s;wer was communicated to the Emperor by the Pope, who, at the &s;ame time, exhorted him to com|ply with demands that appeared to be &s;o rea&s;onable. But Charles was better acquainted with the duplicity of the Pope's character than to be deceived by &s;uch a

gro&s;s artifice; he knew that the prelates of Bologna dur&s;t utter no &s;entiment but what Paul in&s;pired; and, therefore, overlooking them as mere in&s;truments in the hand of another, he con&s;idered their reply as a full di&s;co|very of the Pope's intentions. As he could no longer hope to acquire &s;uch an a&s;cendant in the council as to render it &s;ub&s;ervient to his own plan, he &s;aw it to be nece&s;&s;ary that Paul &s;hould not have it in his power to turn again&s;t him the authority of &s;o venerable an a&s;&s;embly. In or|der to prevent this, he &s;ent two Spani&s;h lawyers to Bo|logna, who, in the pre&s;ence of the legates, prote&s;ted, That the tran&s;lation of the council to that place had been unnece&s;&s;ary, and founded on fal&s;e or frivolous pre|texts; that while it continued to meet there, it ought to be deemed an unlawful and &s;chi&s;matical conventicle; that all its deci&s;ions ought of cour&s;e to be held as null and invalid; and that as the Pope, together with the corrupt eccle&s;ia&s;tics who depended on him, had aban|doned the care of the church, the Emperor, as its pro|tector, would employ all the power which God had com|mitted to him, in order to pre&s;erve it from tho&s;e cala|mities with which it was threatened. A few days after, the Imperial amba&s;&s;ador at Rome demanded an audience of the Pope, and in pre&s;ence of all the cardinals as well as foreign mini&s;ters, prote&s;ted again&s;t the proceedings of the prelates at Bologna, in terms equally har&s;h and di&s;re&s;pectful <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">F.

<P>IT was not long before Charles proceeded to carry the&s;e threats, which greatly alarmed both the Pope and council at Bologna, into execution. He let the Diet know the ill &s;ucce&s;s of his endeavours to procure a fa|vourable an&s;wer to their petitions, and that the Pope, equally regardle&s;s of their entreaties, and of his &s;ervices to the church, had refu&s;ed to gratify them, by allowing the council to meet again at Trent; that, though all hope of holding this a&s;&s;embly in a place where they might look for freedom of debate and judgment, was not to be given up, the pro&s;pect of it was, at pre&s;ent, di&s;tant and uncertain; that, in the mean time, Germany

was torn in pieces by religious di&s;&s;en&s;ions, the purity of the faith corrupted, and the minds of the people di&s;|quieted with a multiplicity of new opinions and contro|ver&s;ies, formerly unknown among Chri&s;tians; that, moved by the duty which he owed to them as their So|vereign, and to the church as its protector, he had em|ployed &s;ome divines, of known abilities and learning, to prepare a &s;y&s;tem of doctrine, to which all &s;hould con|form until a council, &s;uch as they wi&s;hed for, could be convocated. This &s;y&s;tem was compiled by Pflug, Held|ing and Agricola, of whom the two former were digni|taries in the Romi&s;h church, but remarkable for their pacific and healing &s;pirit; the la&s;t was a Prote&s;tant di|vine, &s;u&s;pected, not without rea&s;on, of having been gained by bribes and promi&s;es, to betray or mi&s;lead his party on this occa&s;ion. The articles pre&s;ented to the Diet of Rati&s;bon, in the year one thou&s;and five hundred and forty-one, in order to reconcile the contending par|ties, &s;erved as a model for the pre&s;ent work. But as the Emperor's &s;ituation was much changed &s;ince that time, and he found it no longer nece&s;&s;ary to manage the Pro|te&s;tants with the &s;ame delicacy as at that juncture, the conce&s;&s;ions in their favour were not now &s;o numerous, nor did they extend to points of &s;o much con&s;equence. The treati&s;e contained a compleat &s;y&s;tem of theology, conformable in almo&s;t every article to the tenets of the Romi&s;h church, though expre&s;&s;ed, for the mo&s;t part, in the &s;ofte&s;t words, or in &s;criptural phra&s;es, or in terms of &s;tudied ambiguity. Every doctrine, however, pecu|liar to Popery, was retained; and all the rites, which the Prote&s;tants condemned as inventions of men, intro|duced into the wor&s;hip of God, were enjoined. With regard to two points only, &s;ome relaxation of their ri|gour was granted, and &s;ome latitude in practice admit|ted. Such eccle&s;ia&s;tics as had married, and would not put away their wives, were allowed neverthele&s;s, to per|form all the functions of their &s;acred office; and tho&s;e provinces which had been accu&s;tomed to partake of the cup, as well as of the bread in the &s;acrament of the Lord's Supper, were &s;till indulged the privilege of receiv|ing both. Even the&s;e were declared to be conce&s;&s;ions for the &s;ake of peace, and granted only for a &s;ea&s;on, in com|pliance

<P>THIS &s;y&s;tem of doctrine, known afterwards by the name of the <HI>Interim,</HI> becau&s;e it contained temporary re|gulations which were to continue no longer in force than until a free general council could be held, the Empe|ror pre&s;ented to the Diet, with a pompous declaration of his &s;incere intention to re-e&s;tabli&s;h tranquillity and order in the church, as well as of his hopes that their adopt|ing the&s;e regulations would contribute greatly to bring about that de&s;irable event. It was read, in pre&s;ence, according to form. As &s;oon as it was fini&s;hed the arch|bi&s;hop of Mentz, pre&s;ident of the electoral college, ro&s;e up ha&s;tily, and having thanked the Emperor for his un|wearied and pious endeavours in order to re&s;tore peace to the church, he, in name of the Diet, &s;ignified their approbation of the &s;y&s;tem of doctrine which he had prepared, together with their re&s;olution of conforming to it in every particular. The whole a&s;&s;embly was amazed at a declaration &s;o unprecedented and uncon&s;ti|tutional, as well as at the Elector's pre&s;umption, in pre|tending to deliver the &s;en&s;e of the Diet, upon a point, which had not hitherto been the &s;ubject of con&s;ultation or debate. But not one member had the courage to contradict what the Elector had &s;aid; &s;ome being over|awed by fears, others remaining &s;ilent through com|plai&s;ance. The Emperor held the archbi&s;hop's decla|ration to be a full con&s;titutional ratification of the Inte|rim, and prepared to enforce the ob&s;ervance of it, as a decree of the empire <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 460.

<P>DURING this Diet, the wife and children of the Land|grave, warmly &s;econded by Maurice of Saxony, en|deavoured to intere&s;t the members in behalf of that un|happy Prince, who &s;till langui&s;hed in confinement. But Charles, who did not choo&s;e to be brought under the nece&s;&s;ity of rejecting any reque&s;t that came from &s;uch a re&s;pectable body, in order to prevent their repre|&s;entatives, laid before the Diet an account of his tran&s;|actions
<PB N="141" REF="011837_0960_0F9D8816F089E358">
with the Landgrave, together with the motives which had at fir&s;t induced him to detain that Prince in cu&s;tody, and which rendered it prudent, as he alledged, to keep him &s;till under re&s;traint. It was no ea&s;y matter to give any good rea&s;on for an action, incapable of be|ing ju&s;tified. But he thought the mo&s;t frivolous pre|texts might be produced in an a&s;&s;embly willing to be deceived, and afraid of nothing &s;o much as to di&s;cover that it &s;aw his conduct in its true colours. His account of his own conduct was accordingly admitted to be ful|ly &s;atisfactory, and after &s;ome feeble intreaties that he would extend his clemency to his unfortunate pri&s;oner, the Landgrave's concerns were no more mentioned <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 441.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN order to counterbalance the unfavourable impre&s;|&s;ion which this inflexible rigour might leave in their minds, Charles, as a proof that his gratitude was no le&s;s permanent and unchangeable than his re&s;entment, inve&s;ted Maurice, in the electoral dignity, with all the legal formalities. The ceremony was performed with extraordinary pomp, in an open court, &s;o near the apart|ment in which the degraded Elector was kept a pri&s;oner, that he could view it from his windows. Even this in|&s;ult did not ruffle his u&s;ual tranquillity; and turning his eyes that way, he beheld a pro&s;perous rival receiving tho&s;e en&s;igns of dignity of which he had been &s;tripped, without uttering one &s;entiment unbecoming the forti|tude which he had pre&s;erved amid&s;t all his calamities <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Thuan.

<P>IMMEDIATELY after the di&s;&s;olution of the Diet, the Emperor ordered the Interim to be publi&s;hed in the German as well as Latin language. It met with the u&s;ual reception of conciliating &s;chemes when propo&s;ed to men heated with di&s;putation; both parties declaimed again&s;t it with equal violence. The Prote&s;tants con|demned it as a &s;y&s;tem containing the gro&s;&s;e&s;t errors of Popery, di&s;gui&s;ed with &s;o little art, that it could impo&s;e only on the mo&s;t ignorant, or on tho&s;e who by wilfully &s;hutting their eyes favoured the deception. The Papi&s;ts inveighed again&s;t it, as a work, in which &s;ome doc|trines
<PB N="142" REF="011837_0961_0F9D8817B14D5680">
of the church were impiou&s;ly given up, others meanly concealed, and all of them delivered in terms calculated rather to deceive the unwary, than to in&s;truct the ignorant, or to reclaim tho&s;e who were enemies to the truth. While the Lutheran divines fiercely attacked it, on one hand, the general of the Dominicans with no le&s;s vehemence impugned it, on the other. But at Rome, as &s;oon as the contents of the Interim came to be known, the indignation of the courtiers and eccle|&s;ia&s;tics ro&s;e to the greate&s;t height. They exclaimed again&s;t the Emperor's profane encroachment on the &s;a|cerdotal function, in pre&s;uming, with the concurrence of an a&s;&s;embly of laymen, to define articles of faith, and to regulate modes of wor&s;hip. They compared this ra&s;h deed to that of Uzzah, who, with an unhallowed hand, had touched the ark of God; or to the bold at|tempts of tho&s;e Emperors, who had rendered their me|mory dete&s;table, by endeavouring to model the Chri&s;|tian church according to their plea&s;ure. They even af|fected to find out a re&s;emblance between the Emperor's conduct and that of Henry VIII. and expre&s;&s;ed their fear of his imitating the example of that Monarch, by u&s;urping the title as well as juri&s;diction belonging to the head of the church. All therefore, contended, with one voice, that as the foundations of eccle&s;ia&s;tical autho|rity were now &s;haken, and the whole fabrick ready to be overturned by a new enemy; &s;ome powerful me|thod of defence mu&s;t be provided, and a vigorous re|&s;i&s;tance mu&s;t be made, at the beginning, before he grew too formidable to be oppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>THE Pope, who&s;e judgment was improved by longer experience in great tran&s;actions, as well as by a more exten&s;ive ob&s;ervation of human affairs, viewed the mat|ter with more acute di&s;cernment, and derived comfort from the very circum&s;tance which filled them with ap|prehen&s;ion. He was a&s;toni&s;hed, that a Prince of &s;uch &s;uperior &s;agacity, as the Emperor, &s;hould be &s;o in|toxicated with a &s;ingle victory, as to imagine that he might give law to mankind, and decide even in tho&s;e matters, with regard to which they are mo&s;t impatient of dominion. He &s;aw that, by joining any one of the contending parties in Germany, Charles might have

had it in his power to have oppre&s;&s;ed the other, but that the pre&s;umption of &s;ucce&s;s had now in&s;pired him with the vain thought of his being able to domineer over both; he foretold that a &s;y&s;tem, which all attack|ed, and none defended, could not be of long duration; and that, for this rea&s;on, there was no need of his inter|po&s;ing in order to ha&s;ten its fall; for as &s;oon as the pow|erful hand which now upheld it was withdrawn, it would &s;ink of its own accord, and be forgotten for|ever <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 468. F. Paul, 271, 277. Pallav. ii. 64.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Emperor, fond of his own plan, adhered to his re&s;olution of carrying it into full execution. But though the Elector Palatine, the Elector of Brandenburgh, and Maurice, influenced by the &s;ame con&s;iderations as for|merly, &s;eemed ready to yield implicit obedience to whatever he &s;hould enjoin, he met not every where with a like ob&s;equious &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. John Marquis of Brandenburgh An&s;pach, although he had taken part with great zeal in the war again&s;t the confederates of Smalkalde, refu&s;ed to renounce doctrines which he held to be &s;acred, and reminding the Emperor of the re|peated promi&s;es which he had given his Prote&s;tant allies, of allowing them the free exerci&s;e of their reli|gion, he claimed, in con&s;equence of the&s;e, to be ex|empted from receiving the Interim. Some other Princes, al&s;o, ventured to mention the &s;ame &s;cruples, and to plead the &s;ame indulgence. But on this, as on other trying occa&s;ions, the firmne&s;s of the Elector of Saxony was mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed, and merited the highe&s;t prai&s;e. Charles, well knowing the authority of his example with all the Prote&s;tant party, laboured, with the utmo&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s, to gain his approbation of the Interim, and by employing &s;ometimes promi&s;es of &s;etting him at li|berty, &s;ometimes threats of treating him with greater har&s;hne&s;s, attempted alternately to work upon his hopes and fears. But he was, alike, regardle&s;s of both. Af|ter having declared his fixed belief in the doctrines of the Reformation, "I cannot now," &s;aid he, "in my old age, abandon the principles, for which I early contend|ed; nor, in order to procure freedom during a few de|clining
<PB N="144" REF="011837_0963_0F9D8819302126D8">
years, will I betray that good cau&s;e, on account of which I have &s;uffered &s;o much, and am &s;till willing to &s;uffer. Better for me to enjoy, in this &s;olitude, the e&s;teem of virtuous men, together with the approbation of my own con&s;cience, than to return into the world, with the imputation and guilt of apo&s;tacy, to di&s;grace and embitter the remainder of my days." By this mag|nanimous re&s;olution, he &s;et his countrymen a pattern of conduct, &s;o very different from that which the Em|peror wi&s;hed to have exhibited to them, that it drew upon him fre&s;h marks of his indignation. The rigour of his confinement was increa&s;ed; the number of his &s;er|vants abridged; the Lutheran clergymen who had hi|therto been permitted to attend him, were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; and even the books of devotion, which had been his chief con&s;olation during a tedious impri&s;onment, were taken from him <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 462.</NOTE>. The Landgrave of He&s;&s;e, his com|panion in misfortune, did not maintain the &s;ame con|&s;tancy. His patience and fortitude were both &s;o much exhau&s;ted by the length of his confinement, that wil|ling to purcha&s;e freedom at any price, he wrote to the Emperor, offering not only to approve of the Interim, but to yield an unre&s;erved &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his will in every other particular. But Charles, who knew, that what cour&s;e &s;oever the Landgrave might hold, neither his example nor authority would prevail on his children or &s;ubjects to receive the Interim, paid no regard to his offers. He was kept confined as &s;trictly as ever; and while he &s;uffered the cruel mortification of having his conduct &s;et in contra&s;t to that of the Elector, he deriv|ed not the &s;malle&s;t benefit from the mean &s;tep which expo&s;ed him to &s;uch de&s;erved cen&s;ure <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 462.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT it was in the Imperial cities that Charles met with the mo&s;t violent oppo&s;ition to the Interim. The&s;e &s;mall commonwealths, the citizens of which were ac|cu&s;tomed to liberty and independence, had embraced the doctrines of the Reformation, when fir&s;t publi&s;hed, with remarkable eagerne&s;s; the bold &s;pirit of innova|tion being peculiarly &s;uited to the genius of free go|vernment. Among them, the Prote&s;tant teachers had
<PB N="145" REF="011837_0964_0F9D8819F17237E8">
made the greate&s;t number of pro&s;elytes. The mo&s;t emi|nent divines of the party were &s;ettled there as pa&s;tors. By having the direction of the &s;chools and other &s;emi|naries of learning, they had trained up di&s;ciples as well in&s;tructed in the articles of their faith, as zealous to de|fend them. Such per&s;ons were not to be guided by example, or &s;wayed by authority, but having been taught to examine, and to decide in matters of contro|ver&s;y, thought that they were both qualified and in|titled to judge for them&s;elves. As &s;oon as the contents of the Interim were known, they, with one voice, joined in refu&s;ing to admit it. Stra&s;burgh, Con&s;tance, Bre|men, Magdeburgh, together with many other towns of le&s;s note, pre&s;ented remon&s;trances to the Emperor, &s;et|ting forth the irregular and uncon&s;titutional manner in which the Interim had been enacted, and be&s;eeching him not to offer &s;uch violence to their con&s;ciences, as to re|quire their a&s;&s;ent to a form of doctrine and wor&s;hip, which appeared to them repugnant to the expre&s;s pre|cepts of the divine law. But Charles, having prevailed on &s;o many Princes of the empire to approve of his new model, was not much moved by the repre&s;enta|tions of the&s;e cities, which, how formidable &s;oever they might have proved, it they could have been formed in|to one body, lay &s;o remote from each other, that it was ea&s;y to oppre&s;s them &s;eparately, before it was po&s;&s;ible for them to unite.</P>
<P>IN order to accompli&s;h this, the Emperor &s;aw it to be requi&s;ite that his mea&s;ures &s;hould be vigorous, and exe|cuted with &s;uch rapidity as to allow no time for concert|ing any common plan of oppo&s;ition. Having laid down this maxim as the rule of his proceedings, his fir&s;t at|tempt was upon the city of Aug&s;burgh, which, though over-awed by the pre&s;ence of the Spani&s;h troops, he knew to be as much di&s;&s;atisfied with the Interim as any in the empire. He ordered one body of the&s;e troops to &s;eize the gates; he po&s;ted the re&s;t in different quarters of the city; and a&s;&s;embling all the burge&s;&s;es in the town, he, by his &s;ole ab&s;olute authority, publi&s;hed a decree, aboli&s;hing their pre&s;ent form of government, di&s;&s;olving all their corporations and fraternities, and nominating a &s;mall number of per&s;ons, in whom he ve&s;ted, for the
<PB N="146" REF="011837_0965_0F9D881AB50DECA8">
future, the right of admini&s;tration. Each of the per&s;ons, thus cho&s;en, took an oath to ob&s;erve the Interim. An act of power, &s;o unprecedented as well as arbitrary, which excluded the body of the inhabitants from any &s;hare in the government of their own community, and &s;ubjected them to men who had no other merit than their &s;ervile devotion to the Emperor's will, gave general di&s;gu&s;t; but as they dur&s;t not venture upon re&s;i&s;tance, they were obliged to &s;ubmit in &s;ilence <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 469.</NOTE>. From Aug&s;burgh, in which he left a garri&s;on, he proceeded to Ulm, and new-modelling its go|vernment with the &s;ame violent hand, he &s;eized &s;uch of their pa&s;tors as refu&s;ed to &s;ub&s;cribe the Interim, committed them to pri&s;on, and at his departure carried them along with him in chains <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 472.</NOTE>. By this &s;everity, he not only &s;e|cured the reception of the Interim in two of the mo&s;t powerful cities, but gave warning to the re&s;t what &s;uch as continued refractory had to expect. The effect of the example was as great as he could have wi&s;hed, and many towns, in order to &s;ave them&s;elves from the like vengeance, found it nece&s;&s;ary to comply with what he enjoined. This obedience, extorted by the rigour of authority, produced no change in the &s;entiments of the Germans, and extended no farther than to make them conform &s;o far to the letter of the law, as was barely &s;ufficient to &s;creen them from puni&s;hment. Their preachers accompanied tho&s;e ceremonies, the ob&s;erva|tion of which the Interim pre&s;cribed, with &s;uch an ex|plication of their tendency, as &s;erved rather to confirm than to remove the &s;cruples of their hearers with regard to them. The people, many of whom had grown up to mature years &s;ince the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Reformed re|ligion, and had been accu&s;tomed to no other form of public wor&s;hip, beheld the pompous pageantry of the popi&s;h &s;ervice with contempt or horror; and in mo&s;t places the Romi&s;h eccle&s;ia&s;tics who returned to take po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of their churches could &s;carce be protected from in&s;ult, or their mini&s;trations from interruption. Thus, notwith&s;tanding the apparent compliance of &s;o many ci|ties, the inhabitants being accu&s;tomed to freedom, &s;ub|mitted
<PB N="147" REF="011837_0966_0F9D881B7113C438">
with reluctance to the power which now oppre&s;|&s;ed them. Their under&s;tanding as well as inclination revolted again&s;t the doctrines and rites impo&s;ed on them; and though, for the pre&s;ent, they concealed their in|dignation and re&s;entment, it was evident that the&s;e pa&s;|&s;ions could not always be kept under re&s;traint, but would break out at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in effects proportional to their violence <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Ribier. ii. 218.

<P>CHARLES, meanwhile, highly plea&s;ed with having bended the &s;tubborn &s;pirit of the Germans to &s;uch gene|ral &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, departed for the Low-Countries, fully determined to compel the cites, which &s;till &s;tood out, to receive the Interim. He carried his two pri&s;oners the Elector of Saxony and Landgrave of He&s;&s;e along with him, either becau&s;e he dur&s;t not leave them behind him in Germany, or becau&s;e he wi&s;hed to give his coun|trymen, the Flemings, this illu&s;trious proof of the &s;uc|ce&s;s of his arms, and the extent of his power. Before Charles arrived at Bru&s;&s;els he was informed that the Pope's legates at Bologna had di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the council by an indefinite prorogation, and that the prelates a&s;&s;em|bled there had returned to their re&s;pective countries. Ne|ce&s;&s;ity had driven the Pope into this mea&s;ure. By the &s;ece&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e who had voted again&s;t the tran&s;lation, together with the departure of others, who grew weary of continuing in a place where they were not &s;uffered to proceed to bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;o few and &s;uch incon&s;iderable members remained, that the pompous appellation of a general council could not, with decency, be be&s;towed any longer upon them. Paul had no choice but to di&s;|&s;olve an a&s;&s;embly which was become the object of con|tempt, and exhibited to all Chri&s;tendom a mo&s;t glaring proof of the impotence of the Romi&s;h &s;ee. But, una|voidable as the mea&s;ure was, it lay open to be unfavour|ably interpreted, and had the appearance of withdraw|ing the remedy at the very time when tho&s;e for who&s;e re|covery it was provided, were prevailed on to acknow|ledge its virtue, and to make trial of its effect. Charles did not fail to put this con&s;truction on his conduct; and
<PB N="148" REF="011837_0967_0F9D881C307526C0">
by an artful compari&s;on of his own efforts to &s;uppre&s;s here&s;y, with Paul's &s;candalous inattention to a point &s;o e&s;&s;ential, he endeavoured to render the Pontiff odious to all zealous Catholics. At the &s;ame time, he com|manded the prelates of his faction to remain at Trent, that the council might &s;till appear to have a being, and might be ready, whenever it was thought expedient, to re&s;ume its deliberations for the good of the church <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Pallav. p. 11. 72.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE motive of Charles's journey to the Low-Coun|tries, be&s;ides gratifying his favourite pa&s;&s;ion of travel|ling from one part of his dominions to another, was to receive Philip his only &s;on, who was now in the twenty-fir&s;t year of his age, and whom he had called thither, not only that he might be recognized by the &s;tates of the Netherlands as heir apparent, but in order to facili|tate the execution of a va&s;t &s;cheme, the object of which, and the reception it met with, &s;hall be hereafter ex|plained. Philip, having left the government of Spain to Maximilian, Ferdinand's elde&s;t &s;on, to whom the Em|peror had given the Prince&s;s Mary, his daughter, in marriage, embarked for Italy attended by a numerous retinue of Spani&s;h nobles <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ochoa, Carolea, 362.</NOTE>.

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE REIGN OF THE EMPEROR CHARLES V. BOOK X.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE Charles laboured, with &s;uch unwearied indu&s;try, to overcome the ob&s;tinacy of the Prote&s;tants, the effects of his &s;teadine&s;s in the execution of his plan were rendered le&s;s con&s;iderable by his rupture with the Pope, which daily increa&s;ed. The firm re&s;olution which the Emperor &s;eemed to have taken again&s;t re&s;tor|ing Placentia, together with his repeated encroachments on the eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction, both by the regulations contained in the Interim, and by his attempt to re-a&s;|&s;emble a council at Trent, exa&s;perated Paul to the ut|mo&s;t, who, with the weakne&s;s incident to old age grew more attached to his family, and more jealous or his au|thority, as he advanced in years. Pu&s;hed on by the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, he made new efforts to draw the French King into an alliance again&s;t the Emperor <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Ribier. ii. 230.</NOTE>. But finding that Monarch, notwith&s;tanding his hereditary enmity to Charles, and dread of his growing power, as unwilling as formerly to involve him&s;elf in immediate ho&s;tilities, he was obliged to contract his views, and to think of preventing future encroachments, &s;ince it was not in
<PB N="151" REF="011837_0970_0F9D881E709B7F28">
his power to inflict vengeance on account of tho&s;e which were pa&s;t. For this purpo&s;e, he determined to recal his grant of Parma and Placentia, and after declaring them to be re-annexed to the holy &s;ee, to indemnify Octavio by a new e&s;tabli&s;hment in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate. By this expedient, he hoped to gain two points of no &s;mall con&s;equence; the &s;ecurity of Parma, fir&s;t of all, as the Emperor would be cautious of invading the pa|trimony of the church, though he might &s;eize without &s;cruple a town belonging to the hou&s;e of Farne&s;e; and in the next place, &s;ome chance of recovering Placentia, as his &s;olicitations to that effect might decently be urged with greater importunity, and would infallibly be at|tended with more weight, when he was con&s;idered not as pleading the cau&s;e of his family, but as an advocate for the intere&s;t of the church. But while Paul was prid|ing him&s;elf in this device, as a happy refinement in po|licy, Octavio, an ambitious and high-&s;pirited young man, who could not bear with patience to be &s;poiled of one half of his territories by the rapaciou&s;ne&s;s of his fa|ther-in-law, and to be deprived of the other by the arti|fices of his grandfather, took mea&s;ures in order to pre|vent the execution of a plan &s;o fatal to his intere&s;t. He &s;et out &s;ecretly from Rome, and having fir&s;t endeavour|ed to &s;urprize Parma, which attempt was fru&s;trated by the fidelity of the governor to whom the Pope had en|tru&s;ted the defence of the town, he made overtures to the Emperor of renouncing all connection with the Pope, and depending entirely on him for his future fortune. This unexpected defection of one of the Pope's own fa|mily to an enemy whom he hated, irritated, almo&s;t to madne&s;s, a mind peevi&s;h with old age; and there was no degree of &s;everity to which Paul might not have pro|ceeded again&s;t a grand&s;on whom he reproached as an unnatural apo&s;tate. But happily for Octavio, death pre|vented his carrying into execution the har&s;h re&s;olutions which he had taken with re&s;pect to him, and put an end to his pontificate in the &s;ixteenth year of his admini&s;tra|tion, and the eighty-&s;econd of his age <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Among many in&s;tances of the credulity or weakne&s;s of hi&s;to|rians in attributing the death of illu&s;trious per&s;onages to extraor|dinary cau&s;es, this is one. Almo&s;t all the hi&s;torians of the &s;ix|teenth century affirm, that the death of Paul III. was occa&s;ioned by the violent pa&s;&s;ions which the behaviour of his grand&s;on excited; that being informed, while he was airing him&s;elf, in one of his gardens near Rome, of Octavio's attempt on Parma, as well as of his negociations with the Emperor, by means of Gonzaga, he faint|ed away, continued &s;ome hours in a &s;woon, then fevered, and died within three days. This is the account given of it by Thuanus, lib. vi. 211. Adriani I&s;tor. di &s;uoi tempi, lib. vii. 480. and by Fa|ther Paul, 280. Even cardinal Pallavicini, better informed than any writer with regard to the events which happened in the papal court, and when not warped by prejudice or &s;y&s;tem, more accu|rate in relating them, agrees with their narrative in its chief cir|cum&s;tances. Pallav. b. ii. 74. Paruta, who wrote his hi&s;tory by command of the &s;enate of Venice, relates it in the &s;ame manner. Hi&s;tories Venez. vol. iv. 212. But there was no occa&s;ion to &s;earch for any extraordinary cau&s;e, to account for the death of an old man of eighty-two. There remains an authentic account of this event, in which we find none of the&s;e marvellous circum&s;tances of which the hi&s;torians are &s;o fond. The cardinal of Ferrara, who was en|tru&s;ted with the affairs of France at the court of Rome, and M. L'Urf&eacute;, Henry's amba&s;&s;ador in ordinary there, wrote an account to that Monarch of the affair of Parma, and of the Pope's death. By the&s;e it appears, that Octavio's attempt to &s;urprize Parma was made on the twentieth of October; that the next day in the even|ing, and not while he was airing him&s;elf in the gardens of Monte-Cavallo, the Pope received intelligence of what he had done; that he was &s;eized with &s;uch a tran&s;port of pa&s;&s;ion, and cried &s;o bitter|ly that his voice was heard in &s;everal apartments of the palace; that next day, however, he was &s;o well as to give an audi|ence to the cardinal of Ferrara, and go through bu&s;ine&s;s of dif|ferent kinds; that Octavio wrote a letter to the Pope, not to car|dinal Farne&s;e his brother, intimating his re&s;olution of throwing him&s;elf into the arms of the Emperor; that the Pope received this on the twenty-fir&s;t without any new &s;ymptoms of emotion, and returned an an&s;wer to it; that on the twenty-&s;econd of October, the day on which the cardinal of Ferrara's letter is dated, the Pope was in his u&s;ual &s;tate of health. Mem. de Ribier. ii. 247. By a letter of M. D'Urf&eacute;, Nov. 5. it appears, that the Pope was in &s;uch good health, that on the third of that month he had celebrated the anniver&s;ary of his coronation with the u&s;ual &s;olemnities. Ibidem, 251. By another letter from the &s;ame per&s;on, we learn, that on the &s;ixth of November, a catarrh, or defluxion fell down on the Pope's lungs, with &s;uch dangerous &s;ymptoms, that his life was immediate|ly de&s;paired of, Ibid. 252. And by a third letter, we are inform|ed, that he died November the tenth. In none of the&s;e letters is his death imputed to any extraordinary cau&s;e. It appears, that more than twenty days elap&s;ed between Octavio's attempt on Par|ma and the death of his grandfather, and that the di&s;ea&s;e was the natural effect of old age, not one of tho&s;e occa&s;ioned by violence of pa&s;&s;ion.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="011837_0971_0F9D881F30FF6948">As this event had been long expected, there was an extraordinary concour&s;e of cardinals at Rome; and the various competitors having had time to form their par|ties, and to concert their mea&s;ures, their ambition and intrigues protracted the conclave to a great length. The Imperial and French factions &s;trove, with emulation, to promote one of their own number, and had, by turns, the pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. But as Paul, during a long pon|tificate
<PB N="153" REF="011837_0972_0F9D881FF3BD0A78">
had rai&s;ed many to the purple, and tho&s;e chiefly per&s;ons of eminent abilities as well as zealou&s;ly devoted to his family. Cardinal Farne&s;e had the command of a powerful and united &s;quadron, by who&s;e addre&s;s and firmne&s;s he exalted to the papal throne the Cardinal de Monte, whom Paul had employed as his principal le|gate in the council of Trent, and tru&s;ted with his mo&s;t &s;ecret intentions. He a&s;&s;umed the name of Julius III. and in order to expre&s;s his gratitude towards his bene|factor, the fir&s;t act of his admini&s;tration was to put Oc|tavio Farne&s;e in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Parma. When he was told of the injury which he did the holy &s;ee by alienating a territory of &s;uch value, he bri&s;kly replied, "That he would rather be a poor Pope, with the repu|tation of a gentleman, than a rich one, with the infamy of having forgotten the obligations conferred upon him, and the promi&s;es which he had made <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Ribier.</NOTE>." But all the lu&s;tre of this candour or genero&s;ity he quickly effaced by an action mo&s;t &s;hockingly indecent. According to an antient and e&s;tabli&s;hed practice, every Pope, upon his election, claims the privilege of be&s;towing, on whom he plea&s;es, the cardinal's hat, which falls to be di&s;po&s;ed of by his being ve&s;ted with the triple crown. Julius, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of the &s;acred college, conferred this mark of di&s;tinction, together with ample eccle&s;ia&s;tical reve|nues, and the right of bearing his name and arms, upon one Innocent, a youth of &s;ixteen, born of ob&s;cure pa|rents, and known by the name of the Ape, from his having been entru&s;ted with the care of an animal of that &s;pecies, in the Cardinal di Monte's family. Such a pro|&s;titution of the highe&s;t dignity in the church would have
<PB N="154" REF="011837_0973_0F9D8821378B15F0">
given offence, even in tho&s;e dark periods, when the credulous &s;uper&s;tition of the people emboldened eccle|&s;ia&s;tics to venture on the mo&s;t flagrant violations of de|corum. But in an enlightened age, when, by the pro|gre&s;s of knowledge and philo&s;ophy the obligations of duty and decency were better under&s;tood, when a blind veneration for the pontifical character was every where abated, and one half of Chri&s;tendom in open rebellion again&s;t the papal &s;ee, this action was viewed with hor|ror. Rome was immediately filled with libels and pa&s;|quinades, which imputed the Pope's extravagant regard for &s;uch an unworthy object to the mo&s;t criminal pa&s;|&s;ions. The Prote&s;tants exclaimed again&s;t the ab&s;urdi|ties of &s;uppo&s;ing that the infallible &s;pirit of divine truth could dwell in a brea&s;t &s;o impure, and called mere loud|ly than ever, and with greater appearance of ju&s;tice, for the immediate and thorough reformation of a church, the head of which was a di&s;grace to the Chri&s;tian name <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 492. F. Paul, 281. Pallav. ii. 76. Thuan. lib. vi. 215.</NOTE>. The re&s;t of the Pope's conduct was of a piece with this fir&s;t &s;pecimen of his di&s;po&s;itions. Having now reached the &s;ummit of eccle&s;ia&s;tical ambition, he &s;eemed eager to indemnify him&s;elf, by an unre&s;trained indulgence of his de&s;ires, for the &s;elf-denial or di&s;&s;imulation which he had thought it prudent to practi&s;e while in a &s;ubordinate &s;tation. He became carele&s;s, to &s;o great a degree, of all &s;erious bu&s;ine&s;s, that he could &s;eldom be brought to at|tend to it, but in ca&s;es of extreme nece&s;&s;ity; and giv|ing up him&s;elf to amu&s;ements and di&s;&s;ipation of every kind, he imitated the luxurious elegance of Leo, rather than the &s;evere virtue of Adrian, the latter of which it was nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;play, in contending with a &s;ect which derived great credit from the rigid and au&s;tere manners of its teachers <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">F. Paul, ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Pope, how ready &s;oever to fulfil his engage|ments to the family of Farne&s;e, di&s;covered no inclina|tion to ob&s;erve the oath, which each cardinal had taken when he entered the conclave, that if the choice &s;hould fall on him, he would immediately call the council to re-a&s;&s;ume its deliberations. Julius knew, by experience,
<PB N="155" REF="011837_0974_0F9D882183F47B50">
how difficult it was to confine &s;uch a body of men with|in the narrow limits which it was the intere&s;t of the church of Rome to pre&s;cribe; and how ea&s;ily the zeal of &s;ome members, the ra&s;hne&s;s of others, or the &s;ug|ge&s;tions of the Princes, on whom they depended, might precipitate a popular and ungovernable a&s;&s;embly into forbidden inquiries, as well as dangerous deci&s;ions. He wi&s;hed, for the&s;e rea&s;ons, to have eluded the obliga|tion of his oath, and gave an ambiguous an&s;wer to the fir&s;t propo&s;als, which were made to him by the Empe|ror, with regard to that matter. But as Charles, either from his natural ob&s;tinacy in adhering to the mea&s;ures which he had once adopted, or from the mere pride of accompli&s;hing what was held to be almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible, per&s;i&s;ted in his re&s;olution of forcing the Prote&s;tants to return into the bo&s;om of the church. As he had per|&s;uaded him&s;elf that the authoritative deci&s;ions of the council might be employed with efficacy in combating their prejudices; and in con&s;equence of that per&s;ua&s;ion, &s;olicited earne&s;tly that a new bull of convocation might be i&s;&s;ued, the Pope could not, with decency, reject that reque&s;t. When Julius found that he could not pre|vent the calling of a council, he endeavoured to take the merit of having procured the meeting of an a&s;&s;em|bly, which was the object of &s;uch general de&s;ire and ex|pectation. A congregation of cardinals, to whom he referred the con&s;ideration of what was nece&s;&s;ary for re|&s;toring peace to the church, recommended, by his di|rection, the &s;peedy convocation of a council, as the mo&s;t effectual expedient for that purpo&s;e; and as the new here&s;ies raged with the greate&s;t violence in Germany, they propo&s;ed Trent as the place of its meeting, that by a near in&s;pection of the evil, the remedy might be ap|plied with greater di&s;cernment and certainty of &s;ucce&s;s. The Pope warmly approved this advice, which he him|&s;elf had dictated, and &s;ent nuncios to the Imperial and French courts, in order to make known his intentions <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">F. Paul, 281. Pallav. ii. 77.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, the Emperor had &s;ummoned a new Diet to meet at Aug&s;burgh, in order to enforce the ob|&s;ervation of the Interim, and to procure a more authentic
<PB N="156" REF="011837_0975_0F9D882231A88258">
act of the empire, acknowledging the juri&s;diction of the council, as well as an explicit promi&s;e of conform|ing to its decrees. He appeared there in per&s;on, toge|ther with his &s;on the Prince of Spain. Few of the elec|tors were pre&s;ent, but all &s;ent deputies in their name. Charles, notwith&s;tanding the de&s;potic authority with which he had given law in the empire during two years, knew that the &s;pirit of independence among the Ger|mans was not entirely &s;ubdued, and for that rea&s;on took care to over-awe the Diet by a con&s;iderable body of Spani&s;h troops which e&s;corted him thither. The fir&s;t point, &s;ubmitted to the con&s;ideration of the Diet, was the nece&s;&s;ity of holding a council. All the popi&s;h mem|bers agreed, without difficulty, that the meeting of that a&s;&s;embly &s;hould be renewed at Trent, and promi&s;ed an implicit acquie&s;cence in its decrees. The Prote&s;tants, inti|midated and di&s;united, mu&s;t have followed their ex|ample, and the re&s;olution of the Diet have proved unani|mous, if Maurice of Saxony had not begun, at this time, to di&s;clo&s;e new intentions, and to act a part very different from that which he had &s;o long a&s;&s;umed.</P>
<P>BY an artful di&s;&s;imulation of his own &s;entiments; by addre&s;s in paying court to the Emperor; and by the &s;eeming zeal with which he forwarded all his ambitious &s;chemes, Maurice had rai&s;ed him&s;elf to the Electoral dignity; and having added the dominions of the elder branch of the Saxon family to his own, was become the mo&s;t powerful Prince in Germany. But his long and intimate union with the Emperor had afforded him ma|ny opportunities of ob&s;erving narrowly the dangerous tendency of his &s;chemes. He &s;aw the yoke that was pre|paring for his country; and from the rapid as well as formidable progre&s;s of the Imperial power, was con|vinced that but a few &s;teps more remained to be taken, in order to render Charles as ab&s;olute a Monarch in Germany, as he had become in Spain. The more emi|nent the condition was to which he him&s;elf had been ex|alted, the more &s;olicitous did he naturally become to maintain all its rights and privileges, and the more did he dread the thoughts of de&s;cending from the rank of a Prince almo&s;t independent, to that of a va&s;&s;al &s;ubject to the will of a ma&s;ter. At the &s;ame time, he perceived
<PB N="157" REF="011837_0976_0F9D8822F0ED19C8">
that Charles, in&s;tead of allowing liberty of con&s;cience, the promi&s;e of which had allured &s;everal Prote&s;tant Princes to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the war again&s;t the confederates of Smalkalde, was bent on exacting a rigid conformity to the doctrines and rites of the Romi&s;h church. As he, notwith&s;tanding all the compliances which he had made from motives of intere&s;t, or an exce&s;s of confidence in the Emperor, was &s;incerely attached to the Lutheran tenets, he determined not to be a tame &s;pectator of the overthrow of a &s;y&s;tem which he believed to be founded in truth.</P>
<P>THIS re&s;olution, flowing from the love of liberty, or zeal for religion, was &s;trengthened by political and inte|re&s;ted con&s;iderations. In that elevated &s;tation, in which Maurice was now placed, new and more exten&s;ive pro|&s;pects opened to his view. His rank and power intitled him to be the head of the Prote&s;tants in the empire. His predece&s;&s;or, the degraded Elector, with inferior abi|lities, and territories le&s;s con&s;iderable, had acquired &s;uch an a&s;cendant over the councils of the party; and Mau|rice neither wanted di&s;cernment to &s;ee the advantage of this pre-eminence, nor ambition to aim at attaining it. But he found him&s;elf in a &s;ituation which rendered the attempt no le&s;s difficult, than the object of it was im|portant. On the one hand, the connection which he had formed with the Emperor was &s;o intimate, that he could &s;carce hope to take any &s;tep which tended to di&s;|&s;olve it, without alarming his jealou&s;y, and drawing on him&s;elf the whole weight of that power, which had cru&s;hed the greate&s;t confederacy ever formed in Ger|many. On the other hand, the calamities which he had brought on the Prote&s;tant party were &s;o recent and &s;o great, that it &s;eemed almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to regain their confidence, or to rally and re-animate a body of men, after him&s;elf had been the chief in&s;trument in breaking their union and vigour. The&s;e con&s;iderations were &s;uf|ficient to have di&s;couraged any per&s;on of a &s;pirit le&s;s ad|venturous than Maurice's. But to him the grandeur and va&s;tne&s;s of the enterprizes were allurements; and he boldly re&s;olved on mea&s;ures, of which a genius of an inferior order could have conceived no idea, or would
<PB N="158" REF="011837_0977_0F9D8823AFEFD9C0">
have trembled at the thoughts of the danger which at|tended the execution of them.</P>
<P>HIS pa&s;&s;ions concurred with his intere&s;t in confirm|ing this re&s;olution; and the re&s;entment excited by an injury, which he &s;uddenly felt, added new force to the motives for oppo&s;ing the Emperor, which &s;ound policy &s;ugge&s;ted. Maurice, by his authority, had prevailed on the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e to put his per&s;on in the Empe|ror's power, and had obtained a promi&s;e from the Impe|rial mini&s;ters that he &s;hould not be detained a pri&s;oner. This had been violated in the manner already related. The unhappy Landgrave exclaimed as loudly again&s;t his &s;on-in-law as again&s;t Charles. The Princes of He&s;&s;e required him ince&s;&s;antly to fulfil his engagements to their father, who had lo&s;t his liberty by tru&s;ting to him; and all Germany &s;u&s;pected him of having betrayed, to an im|placable enemy, the friend whom he was mo&s;t bound to protect. Rouzed by the&s;e &s;olicitations and reproaches, as well as prompted by duty and affection to his father-in-law, Maurice had employed not only entreaties but re|mon&s;trances in order to procure his relea&s;e. All the&s;e Charles had di&s;regarded; and the &s;hame of having been fir&s;t deceived and then &s;lighted by a Prince whom he had &s;erved with zeal and &s;ucce&s;s, which merited a very different return, made &s;uch a deep impre&s;&s;ion on Mau|rice, that he waited with impatience for an opportunity of being revenged.</P>
<P>THE utmo&s;t caution as well as delicacy were requi|&s;ite in taking every &s;tep towards this end; as he had to guard, on the one hand, again&s;t giving a premature alarm to the Emperor; while, on the other, &s;omething con&s;iderable and explicit was nece&s;&s;ary to be done, in order to regain the confidence of the Prote&s;tant party. Maurice had accordingly applied all his powers of addre&s;s and di&s;&s;imulation to attain both the&s;e points. As he knew Charles to be inflexible with regard to the &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion which he required to the Interim, he did not he&s;itate one moment whether he &s;hould e&s;tabli&s;h that form of doctrine and wor&s;hip in his dominions. But being &s;en&s;ible how odious it was to his &s;ubjects, in&s;tead of violently impo&s;ing it on them by the mere terror of authority, as had been done in other parts of Germany,
<PB N="159" REF="011837_0978_0F9D882471AEEAF8">
he endeavoured to render their obedience a voluntary deed of their own. For this purpo&s;e, he had a&s;&s;embled the clergy of his country at Leip&s;ic, and had laid the In|terim before them, together with the rea&s;ons which made it nece&s;&s;ary to conform to it. He had gained &s;ome of them by promi&s;es, others he had wrought upon by threats, and all were intimidated by the rigour with which obedience to the Interim was extorted in the neighbouring provinces. Even Melancthon, who&s;e me|rit of every kind intitled him to the fir&s;t place among the Prote&s;tant divines, being now deprived of the manly coun&s;els of Luther, which were wont to in&s;pire him with fortitude, and to pre&s;erve him &s;teady amid&s;t the &s;torms and dangers that threatened the church, was &s;e|duced into unwarrantable conce&s;&s;ions, by the timidity of his temper, his fond de&s;ire of peace, and his exce&s;&s;ive complai&s;ance towards per&s;ons of high rank. By his ar|guments and authority, no le&s;s than by Maurice's arts, the a&s;&s;embly was prevailed on to declare, that in points which were purely indifferent, obedience was due to the commands of a lawful &s;uperior. Founding upon this maxim, no le&s;s uncontrovertible in theory, than dan|gerous when carried into practice, e&s;pecially in religi|ous matters, they proceeded to cla&s;s, among the num|ber of things indifferent, &s;everal doctrines, which Lu|ther had pointed out as gro&s;s and pernicious errors in the Romi&s;h creed, as well as many of tho&s;e rites which di&s;tingui&s;hed the Reformed from the Popi&s;h wor&s;hip, and by con&s;equence, they exhorted their people to com|ply with the Emperor's injunctions concerning the&s;e particulars <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Sleid 481, 485.

<P>BY this dextrous conduct, the introduction of the In|terim excited none of tho&s;e violent convul&s;ions in Saxo|ny, which it occa&s;ioned in other provinces.

it up from pu&s;illanimity and criminal complai&s;ance to a Prince, capable of &s;acrificing to his political intere&s;t, that which he him&s;elf regarded as mo&s;t &s;acred.

<P>HAVING gone &s;o far in order to remove the fears and jealou&s;ies of the Prote&s;tants, he found it nece&s;&s;ary to ef|face the impre&s;&s;ion which &s;uch a declaration might make on the Emperor. For that purpo&s;e, he not only renew|ed his profe&s;&s;ions of an unviolable adherence to his alli|ance with him, but as the city of Magdeburgh &s;till per|&s;i&s;ted in rejecting the Interim, he undertook to reduce it to obedience, and in&s;tantly &s;et about levying the troops to be employed in that &s;ervice. This damped all the hopes which the Prote&s;tants begun to conceive of Maurice, in con&s;equence of his declaration, and left them more than ever at a lo&s;s to gue&s;s at his real inten|tions. Their former &s;u&s;picion and di&s;tru&s;t of him re|vived, and the divines of Magdeburgh filled Germany with writings, in which they repre&s;ented him as the mo&s;t formidable enemy of the Prote&s;tant religion, who treacherou&s;ly a&s;&s;umed an appearance of zeal for its inte|re&s;t, that he might more effectually execute his &s;chemes for its de&s;truction.</P>
<P>THIS charge, &s;upported by the evidence of recent facts, as well as by his pre&s;ent dubious conduct, gained &s;uch univer&s;al credit, that Maurice was obliged to take take a vigorous &s;tep in his own vindication. As &s;oon as the re-a&s;&s;embling of the council at Trent was propo&s;ed in the Diet, his amba&s;&s;adors prote&s;ted, that their ma&s;ter would not acknowledge its authority, unle&s;s all the points which had been already decided there were re|viewed, and con&s;idered as entire; unle&s;s the Prote&s;tant divines had a full hearing granted them, and were allow|ed a deci&s;ive voice in the council; and unle&s;s the Pope

renounced his preten&s;ions to pre&s;ide in the council, en|gaged to &s;ubmit to its decrees, and ab&s;olved the bi&s;hops from their oath of obedience, that they might deliver their &s;entiments with greater freedom. The&s;e demands, which were higher than any that the Reformers had ventured to make, even when the zeal of their party was warme&s;t, or their affairs mo&s;t pro&s;perous, counter|balanced, in &s;ome degree, the effect of Maurice's prepa|rations again&s;t Magdeburgh, and kept the Prote&s;tants in &s;u&s;pen&s;e with regard to his de&s;igns. At the &s;ame time, he had addre&s;s enough to repre&s;ent this part of his conduct in &s;uch a light to the Emperor, that it gave him no offence, and occa&s;ioned no interruption of the &s;trict confidence which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them. What the pretexts were which he employed in order to give &s;uch a bold declaration an innocent appearance, the con|temporary hi&s;torians have not explained; that they im|po&s;ed upon Charles is certain, for he &s;till continued to pro&s;ecute his plan as well concerning the Interim as the council, with the &s;ame ardour; and to place the &s;ame confidence in Maurice, with regard to the execution of both.</P>
<P>THE Pope's re&s;olution concerning the council not be|ing yet known at Aug&s;burgh, the chief bu&s;ine&s;s of the Diet was to enforce the ob&s;ervation of the Interim. As the &s;enate of Magdeburgh, notwith&s;tanding various en|deavours to frighten or to &s;ooth them into compliance, not only per&s;evered ob&s;tinately in their oppo&s;ition to the Interim, but began to &s;trengthen the fortifications of their city, and to levy troops in their own defence, Charles required of the Diet, that they would a&s;&s;i&s;t him in quelling this audacious rebellion again&s;t a decree of the empire. Had the members of the Diet been left to act agreeably to their own inclination, this demand would have been rejected without he&s;itation. All the Germans who favoured, in any degree, the new opinions in religion, and many who were influenced by no other con&s;ideration than jealou&s;y of the Emperor's growing power, regarded this effort of the citizens of Magde|burgh, as a noble &s;tand for the liberties of their coun|try. Even &s;uch as had not re&s;olution to exert the &s;ame &s;pirit, admired the gallantry of their enterprize, and
<PB N="162" REF="011837_0981_0F9D8826B3084520">
wi&s;hed it &s;ucce&s;s. But the pre&s;ence of the Spani&s;h troops, together with the dread of the Emperor's di&s;|plea&s;ure, over-awed tho&s;e who were pre&s;ent in the Diet to &s;uch a degree, that without venturing to utter their own &s;entiments, they tamely ratified, by their votes, whatever the Emperor was plea&s;ed to pre&s;cribe. The rigorous decrees, which Charles had i&s;&s;ued by his own authority again&s;t the Magdeburghers, were confirmed; a re&s;olution was taken to rai&s;e troops in order to be&s;iege the city in form; and per&s;ons were named to fix the contingent in men or money to be furni&s;hed by each &s;tate. At the &s;ame time, the Diet petitioned that Mau|rice might be entru&s;ted with the command of that ar|my, to which Charles gave his con&s;ent with great ala|crity, and with high encomiums upon the wi&s;dom of the choice which they had made <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 503, 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">2.</NOTE>. As Maurice con|ducted all his &s;chemes with profound and impenetrable &s;ecrecy; it is probable that he took no &s;tep avowedly in order to obtain this charge. The recommendation of his countrymen was either purely accidental, or flowed from the opinion generally entertained of his great abi|lities; and neither the Diet had any fore&s;ight, nor the Emperor any dread of the con&s;equences which followed upon this nomination. Maurice accepted without he&s;i|tation the tru&s;t committed to him, in&s;tantly di&s;cerning the important advantages which he might derive from it.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, Julius, in preparing the bull for the convocation of the council, ob&s;erved all tho&s;e tedious forms which the court of Rome can employ, with &s;o much dexterity, to retard any di&s;agreeable mea&s;ure. At la&s;t it was publi&s;hed, and the council &s;ummoned to meet at Trent on the fir&s;t day of the en&s;uing month of May. As he knew that many of the Germans rejected or di&s;puted the authority and juri&s;diction which the papal &s;ee claims with re&s;pect to general councils, he took care, in the preamble of the bull, to a&s;&s;ert, in the &s;tronge&s;t terms, his own right, not only to call and pre&s;ide in that a&s;&s;embly, but to direct its proceedings; nor would he &s;often the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, in any degree, notwith&s;tand|ing

the repeated &s;olicitations of the Emperor, who fore|&s;aw what offence they would give, and what con&s;truc|tion might be put on them. They were cen&s;ured ac|cordingly, with great &s;everity, by &s;everal members of the Diet, but whatever di&s;gu&s;t or &s;u&s;picion they excited, &s;uch ab&s;olute direction of all their deliberations had the Emperor acquired, that he procured a rece&s;s in which the authority of the council was recognized, and declar|ed to be the proper remedy for the evils which at that time afflicted the church; all the Princes and &s;tates of the empire, &s;uch as had made innovations in religion, as well as tho&s;e who adhered to the &s;y&s;tem of their fore|fathers, were required to &s;end their repre&s;entatives to the council; the Emperor engaged to grant a &s;afe con|duct to &s;uch as demanded it, and to &s;ecure them an im|partial hearing in the council; he promi&s;ed to fix his re&s;idence in &s;ome city of the empire, in the neighbour|hood of Trent, that he might protect the members of the council by his pre&s;ence, and take care that, by con|ducting their deliberations agreeable to &s;cripture and the doctrine of the fathers, they might bring them to a de&s;irable i&s;&s;ue. In this rece&s;s, the ob&s;ervation of the Interim was more &s;trictly enjoined than ever, and the Emperor threatened all who had hitherto neglected or refu&s;ed to conform to it, with the &s;evere&s;t effects of his vengeance, if they per&s;i&s;ted in their di&s;obedience <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 512.

<P>DURING the meeting of this Diet, a new attempt was made in order to procure liberty to the Landgrave. That Prince, nowi&s;e reconciled by time to his &s;ituation, grew every day more impatient of re&s;traint. Having often applied to Maurice and the Elector of Branden|burgh, who took every occa&s;ion of &s;oliciting the Empe|ror in his behalf, though without any effect, he now commanded his &s;ons to &s;ummon them, with legal for|mality, to perform what was contained in the bond they had granted him, by &s;urrendering them&s;elves to be treat|ed with the &s;ame rigour as the Emperor had u&s;ed him. This furni&s;hed them with a fre&s;h pretext for renewing their application to the Emperor, together with an ad|ditional
<PB N="164" REF="011837_0983_0F9D88283395CF80">
argument to enforce it. Charles firmly re&s;olved not to grant their reque&s;t; though, at the &s;ame time, be|ing extremely de&s;irous to get rid of their ince&s;&s;ant im|portunity, he endeavoured to prevail on the Landgrave to give up the obligation which he had received from the two Electors. But that Prince refu&s;ing to part with a &s;ecurity which he deemed e&s;&s;ential to his &s;afety, the Emperor boldly cut the knot which he could not untie; and by a public deed annulled the bond which Maurice and the Elector of Brandenburgh had granted, ab&s;olving them from all their engagements to the Landgrave. No preten&s;ion to a power &s;o pernicious to &s;ociety as that of abrogating at plea&s;ure the mo&s;t &s;acred laws of honour, and mo&s;t formal obligations of public faith, had hitherto been formed by any but the Roman Pontiffs, who, in con&s;equence of their claim of infallibility, arrogate the right of di&s;pen&s;ing with precepts and duties of every kind. All Germany was filled with a&s;toni&s;hment, when Charles a&s;&s;umed the &s;ame prerogative. The &s;tate of &s;ub|jection, to which the empire was reduced, appeared to be more rigorous as well as intolerable than that of the mo&s;t wretched and en&s;laved nations, if the Emperor, by an arbitrary decree, might cancel tho&s;e &s;olemn contracts, which are the foundation of that mutual confidence whereby men are held together in &s;ocial union. The Landgrave him&s;elf now gave up all hopes of recovering his liberty by the Emperor's con&s;ent, and endeavoured to procure it by his own addre&s;s. But the plan which he had formed to deceive his guards being di&s;covered, &s;uch of his attendants as he had gained to favour his e&s;cape were put to death, and he was confined in the ci|tadel of Mechlin more clo&s;ely than ever <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 504.

<P>ANOTHER tran&s;action was carried on during this Diet, with re&s;pect to an affair more nearly intere&s;ting to the Emperor, and which occa&s;ioned likewi&s;e a general alarm among the Princes of the empire. Charles, though formed with talents which fitted him for con|ceiving and conducting great de&s;igns, was not capable, as has been ob&s;erved, of bearing extraordinary &s;ucce&s;s. Its operation on his mind was &s;o violent and intoxicat|ing,
<PB N="165" REF="011837_0984_0F9D8828F4C932E8">
that it elevated him beyond what was moderate or attainable, and turned his whole attention to the pur&s;uit of va&s;t but chimerical objects. Such had been the ef|fect of his victory over the confederates of Smalkalde. He did not long re&s;t &s;atisfied with the &s;ub&s;tantial and certain advantages which were the re&s;ult of that event, but de&s;pi&s;ing the&s;e, as poor or incon&s;iderable fruits of &s;uch great &s;ucce&s;s, he had aimed at bringing all Ger|many to an uniformity in religion, and at rendering the Imperial power de&s;potic. The&s;e were objects ex|tremely &s;plendid, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, and allur|ing to an ambitious mind; the pur&s;uit at them, how|ever, was attended with manife&s;t danger, and the at|tainment of them very precarious. But the &s;teps which he had already taken towards them, being accompanied with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, his imagination, warmed with con|templating this va&s;t de&s;ign, overlooked or de&s;pi&s;ed all difficulties. As he conceived the execution of his plan to be certain, he began to be &s;olicitous how he might render the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch an important acqui&s;ition perpetual in his family, by tran&s;mitting the German empire, as well as the kingdoms of Spain, and his do|minions in Italy and the Low-Countries, to his &s;on. Having long revolved this flattering idea in his mind, without communicating it, even to tho&s;e mini&s;ters whom he mo&s;t tru&s;ted, he had called Philip out of Spain, in hopes that his pre&s;ence would facilitate the carrying forward the &s;cheme.</P>
<P>GREAT ob&s;tacles, however, and &s;uch as would have deterred any ambition le&s;s accu&s;tomed to overcome difficulties, were to be &s;urmounted. He had, in the year one thou&s;and five hundred and thirty, imprudently a&s;&s;i&s;ted in procuring his brother Ferdinand the dignity of King of the Romans, and there was no probability that this Prince, who was &s;till in the prime of life, and h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d a &s;on grown up to the years of manhood, would re|linqui&s;h, in favour of his nephew, the near pro&s;pect of the Imperial throne, which Charles's infirmities and de|clining &s;tate of health opened to him. This did not de|ter the Emperor from venturing to make the propo&s;i|tion; and when Ferdinand, notwith&s;tanding his pro|found reverence for his brother, and ob&s;equious &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion
<PB N="166" REF="011837_0985_0F9D88E83261FEB8">
to his will in other in&s;tances, rejected it in a peremptory tone, he was not di&s;couraged by one re|pul&s;e. He renewed his applications to him by his &s;i&s;ter, Mary Queen of Hungary and Bohemia, and who, by her great abilities, tempered with extreme gentlene&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, had acquired an extraordinary influence over both the brothers. She entered warmly into a mea&s;ure, which tended &s;o manife&s;tly to aggrandize the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria; and flattering her&s;elf that &s;he could tempt Ferdinand to renounce the rever&s;ionary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Imperial dignity for an immediate e&s;tabli&s;hment, &s;he a&s;&s;ured him that the Emperor, by way of compen|&s;ation for his giving up his chance of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, would in&s;tantly be&s;tow upon him territories of very con&s;ider|able value, and pointed out in particular tho&s;e of the Duke of Wurtemberg, which might be confi&s;cated upon different pretexts. But Ferdinand was more am|bitious than to be per&s;uaded, by her addre&s;s or intrea|ties, to approve of a plan, which would have degraded him from the highe&s;t rank among the Monarchs of Eu|rope to that of a &s;ubordinate and dependent Prince. He was at the &s;ame time, more attached to his children than to fru&s;trate, by a ra&s;h conce&s;&s;ion, all the high hopes in pro&s;pect of which they had been educated.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the immoveable firmne&s;s which Ferdinand di&s;covered, the Emperor did not abandon his &s;cheme. He flattered him&s;elf that he might attain the object in view by another channel, and that it was not impo&s;&s;ible to prevail on the electors to cancel their former choice of Ferdinand, or at lea&s;t to elect Philip a &s;econd King of the Romans, &s;ub&s;tituting him as next in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to his uncle. With this view he took Phi|lip along with him to the Diet, that the Germans might have an opportunity to ob&s;erve and become acquainted with the Prince, in behalf of whom he courted their in|tere&s;t; and he him&s;elf employed all the arts of addre&s;s or in&s;inuation to gain the electors, and to prepare them for lending a favourable ear to the propo&s;al. But no &s;ooner did he venture upon mentioning it to them, than they, at once, &s;aw and trembled at the con&s;equences with which it would be attended. They had long felt all the inconveniences of having placed at the head of
<PB N="167" REF="011837_0986_0F9D88E8F2489EA0">
the empire, a Prince who&s;e power and dominions were &s;o exten&s;ive; if they &s;hould now repeat the folly, and continue the Imperial crown, like an hereditary dignity, in the &s;ame family, they fore&s;aw, that they would give the &s;on an opportunity of carrying on that &s;y&s;tem of op|pre&s;&s;ion which the father had begun; and would put it in his power to overturn whatever was yet left entire in the antient and venerable fabric of the German con&s;ti|tution.</P>
<P>THE character of the Prince, in who&s;e favour this ex|traordinary propo&s;ition was made, rendered it &s;till le&s;s agreeable. Philip, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an in&s;atiable de&s;ire of power, was a &s;tranger to all the arts of conci|liating good-will. Haughty, re&s;erved and &s;evere, he, in&s;tead of gaining new friends, di&s;gu&s;ted the antient and mo&s;t devoted partizans of the Au&s;trian intere&s;t. He &s;corned to take the trouble of acquiring the language of the country, to the government of which he a&s;pired; nor would he conde&s;cend to pay the Germans the com|pliment of accommodating him&s;elf, during his re&s;idence among them, to their manners and cu&s;toms. He al|lowed the Electors and mo&s;t illu&s;trious Princes in Ger|many to remain in his pre&s;ence uncovered, affecting a &s;tately and di&s;tant demeanour, which the greate&s;t of the German Emperors, and even Charles him&s;elf, amid&s;t the pride of power and victory, had never a&s;&s;umed <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Frediman Andreae Zulich Di&s;&s;ertatio politico&mdash;Hi&s;torica de Naevis politicis Caroli V.

On the other hand, Ferdinand, from the time of his arrival in Germany, had &s;tudied to render him&s;elf ac|ceptable to the people, by a conformity to their man|ners, which &s;eemed to flow from choice; and his &s;on Maximilian, who was born in Germany, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in an eminent degree, &s;uch amiable qualities, as rendered him the darling of his countrymen, and induced them to look forward to his election as a mo&s;t de&s;irable event. Their e&s;teem and affection for him fortified the re&s;olu|tion which &s;ound policy had &s;ugge&s;ted; and determined the Germans to prefer the popular virtues of Ferdinand and his &s;on, to the &s;tubborn au&s;terity of Philip, which intere&s;t could not &s;often, nor ambition teach him to di&s;|gui&s;e.

All the electors, the eccle&s;ia&s;tical as well as &s;e|cular, concurred in expre&s;&s;ing &s;uch &s;trong di&s;approba|tion of the mea&s;ure, that Charles, notwith&s;tanding the reluctance with which he gave up any point, was obliged to drop the &s;cheme as impracticable. By his un&s;ea&s;on|able per&s;everance in pu&s;hing it, he not only filled the Germans with new jealou&s;y of his ambitious de&s;igns, but laid the foundation of rival&s;hip and di&s;cord in the Au|&s;trian family, and forced his brother Ferdinand, in &s;elf-defence, to court the electors, particularly Maurice of Saxony, and to form &s;uch connections with them, as cut off all pro&s;pect of renewing the propo&s;al with &s;ucce&s;s.

<P>HAVING relinqui&s;hed this plan of dome&s;tic ambition which had long occupied and engro&s;&s;ed him, Charles imagined that he would now have lei&s;ure to turn all his attention towards his grand &s;cheme of e&s;tabli&s;hing uni|formity of religion in the empire, by forcing all the contending parties to acquie&s;ce in the deci&s;ions of the council of Trent. But &s;uch was the extent of his do|minions, the variety of connections in which this entang|led him, and the multiplicity of events to which the&s;e gave ri&s;e, as &s;eldom allowed him to apply his whole force to any one object. The machine which he had to conduct was &s;o great and complicated, that an unfore|&s;een irregularity, or ob&s;truction in one of the inferior wheels, often di&s;concerted the motion of the whole, and di&s;appointed him of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable effects which he expected. Such an unlooked-for occurrence hap|pened at this juncture, and created new ob&s;tacles to the execution of his &s;chemes with regard to religion. Ju|lius III. though he had confirmed Octavio Farne&s;e in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the dutchy of Parma, during the fir&s;t effu&s;ions of joy and gratitude on his promotion to the papal throne, &s;oon began to repent of his own genero|&s;ity, and to be apprehen&s;ive of con&s;equences which ei|ther he did not fore&s;ee, or had di&s;regarded while the

&s;en&s;e of his obligations to the family of Farne&s;e was re|cent. The Emperor &s;till retained Placentia in his hands, and had not relinqui&s;hed his preten&s;ions to Parma, as a fief of the empire. Gonzaga, the governor of Milan, having, by the part which he took in the murder of the late Duke Peter Ludovico, offered an in&s;ult to the fa|mily of Farne&s;e, which he knew could never be for|given, had for that rea&s;on vowed its de&s;truction, and employed all the influence, which his great abilities as well as long &s;ervices gave him with the Emperor, in per|&s;uading him to &s;eize Parma by force of arms.

But as the expence of &s;uch an effort far exceeded his &s;canty revenues, he repre&s;ented his &s;itua|tion to the Pope, and implored that protection and a&s;|&s;i&s;tance which was due to him as a va&s;&s;al of the church. The Imperial mini&s;ter, however, had already pre-occu|pied the Pope's ear; and by di&s;cour&s;ing continually concerning the danger of giving offence to the Empe|ror, as well as the imprudence of &s;upporting Octavio in an u&s;urpation &s;o detrimental to the holy &s;ee, had total|ly alienated him from the family of Farne&s;e. Octavio's remon&s;trance and petition met, of con&s;equence, with a cold reception; and he, de&s;pairing of any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Julius, began to look round for protection from &s;ome other quarter. Henry II. of France was the only Prince powerful enough to afford him this protection, and fortunately he was now in a &s;ituation which allowed him to undertake it. He had brought his tran&s;actions with the two Briti&s;h kingdoms, which had hitherto di|verted his attention from the affairs of the continent, to &s;uch an i&s;&s;ue as he de&s;ired. This he had effected partly by the vigour of his arms, partly by his dexterity in tak|ing advantage of the political factions which raged in

both kingdoms, and rendered the coun&s;els of the Scots violent and precipitate, and the operations of the Eng|li&s;h feeble and un&s;teady. He had procured from the Engli&s;h favourable conditions of peace for his allies the Scots; he had prevailed on the nobles of Scotland not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to affiance their young Queen to his &s;on the Dau|phin, but even to &s;end her into France, that &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> be educated under his eye; and had recovered Bologne, together with its dependencies, which had been con|quered by Henry VIII.</P>
<P>HAVING gained points of &s;o much con&s;equence to his crown, and di&s;engaged him&s;elf with &s;uch honour from the burden of &s;upporting the Scots, and maintaining a war again&s;t England. Henry was now at full lei&s;ure to pur&s;ue the mea&s;ures which his hereditary jealou&s;y of the Emperor's power naturally &s;ugge&s;ted. He li&s;tened, ac|cordingly, to the fir&s;t overtures which Octavio Farne&s;e made him; and embracing eagerly an opportunity of recovering footing in Italy, he in&s;tantly concluded a treaty, in which he promi&s;ed to e&s;pou&s;e his cau&s;e, and to furni&s;h him with all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which he de&s;ired. This tran&s;action could not be long kept &s;ecret from the Pope, who fore&s;eeing the calamities which mu&s;t fol|low if war was rekindled &s;o near the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate, immediately i&s;&s;ued monitory letters, requiring Octavio, to relinqui&s;h his new alliance. Upon his refu&s;al to com|ply with the requi&s;ition, he &s;oon after pronounced his fief to be forfeited, and declared war again&s;t him as a di&s;obedient and rebellious va&s;&s;al. But as he could not hope, with his own forces alone, to &s;ubdue Octavio, while &s;upported by &s;uch a powerful ally as the King of France, he had recour&s;e to the Emperor, who being ex|tremely &s;olicitous to prevent the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the French in Parma, ordered Gonzaga to &s;econd Julius with all his troops. Thus the French took the field as the allies of Octavio; the Imperiali&s;ts as the protectors of the holy &s;ee; and ho&s;tilities commenced between them, while Charles and Henry them&s;elves &s;till affected to give out that they would adhere inviolably to the peace of Cre&s;py.

<P>BUT the motions and alarm which this war, or the preparation for it, occa&s;ioned in Italy, prevented mo&s;t of the Italian prelates from repairing to Trent on the fir&s;t of May, the day appointed for re-a&s;&s;embling the coun|cil; and though the papal legate and nuncios re&s;orted thither, they were obliged to adjourn to the fir&s;t of Sep|tember, hoping &s;uch a number might then a&s;&s;emble, that they might with decency begin their deliberations.

<P>THE Emperor, neverthele&s;s, was &s;training his autho|rity to the utmo&s;t, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h the reputation and juri&s;diction of the council. He had prevailed on the three eccle&s;ia&s;tical Electors, the prelates of greate&s;t power and dignity in the church, next to the Pope, to repair thither in per&s;on. He had obliged &s;everal Ger|man bi&s;hops of inferior rank to go to Trent them&s;elves, or to &s;end their proxies. He granted an Imperial &s;afe conduct to the amba&s;&s;adors nominated by the Elector of Brandenburgh, the Duke of Wurtemberg, and other Prote&s;tant &s;tates, to attend the council; and exhorted them to &s;end their divines thither, in order to propound, explain and defend their doctrine. At the &s;ame time, his zeal anticipated the decrees of the council; and, as if the Prote&s;tant doctrines had already been condemned, he took large &s;teps towards exterminating them. With this intention, he called together the mini&s;ters of Aug&s;|burgh; and after interrogating them concerning &s;everal controverted points, enjoined them to teach nothing with re&s;pect to the&s;e, contrary to the tenets of the Romi&s;h church. Upon their declining to comply with a requi|&s;ition &s;o contrary to the dictates of their con&s;ciences, he commanded them to leave the town in three days, with|out revealing to any per&s;on the cau&s;e of their bani&s;h|ment; he prohibited them to preach for the future in any of the countries &s;ubject to the Imperial juri&s;diction; and obliged them to take an oath that they would punc|tually obey the&s;e injunctions. They were not the only victims to his zeal. The Prote&s;tant clergy, in mo&s;t of the cities in the circle of Suabia, were ejected with the &s;ame violence; and in many places, &s;uch magi&s;trates as had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by their attachment to the new opinions, were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with the mo&s;t abrupt irre|gularity, and their offices filled, in con&s;equence of the Emperor's arbitrary appointment, with the mo&s;t bigotted of their adver&s;aries. The Reformed wor&s;hip was almo&s;t entirely &s;uppre&s;&s;ed throughout that exten&s;ive province. The antient and fundamental privileges of the free cities were violated.

He fixed his re&s;idence in that city, as by its &s;i|tuation in the neighbourhood of Trent, and on the con|fines of Italy, it appeared a commodious &s;tation, whence he might in&s;pect the operations of the council, and ob|&s;erve the progre&s;s of the war in the Parme&s;an, without lo&s;ing &s;ight of the occurrences that might happen in Germany <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 329.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DURING the&s;e tran&s;actions, the &s;iege of Magdeburgh was carried on with various &s;ucce&s;s. At the time when Charles pro&s;cribed the citizens of Magdeburgh, and put them under the ban of the empire, he had exhorted and even enjoined all the neighbouring &s;tates to take arms again&s;t them, as rebels and common enemies. En|couraged by his exhortations as well as promi&s;es George of Mecklenburgh, a younger brother of the reigning Duke, an active and ambitious Prince, collected a con|&s;iderable number of tho&s;e &s;oldiers of fortune who had accompanied Henry of Brun&s;wick in all his wild enter|prizes; and though a zealous Lutheran him&s;elf, invad|ed the territories of the Magdeburghers, hoping, that by the merit of this &s;ervice, he might procure &s;ome part of their domains to be allotted to him as an e&s;tabli&s;hment. The citizens, unaccu&s;tomed as yet to endure patiently the calamities of war, could not be re&s;trained from &s;ally|ing out in order to &s;ave their lands from being laid wa&s;te. They attacked the Duke of Mecklenburgh with more courage than conduct, and were repul&s;ed with great &s;laughter. But as they were animated with that un|conquerable &s;pirit, which flows from zeal for religion, co-operating with the love of civil liberty, far from be|ing di&s;heartened by their misfortune, they prepared to defend them&s;elves with vigour. Many of the veteran &s;oldiers who had &s;erved in the long wars between the
<PB N="174" REF="011837_0993_0F9D88EE30B62F30">
Emperor and King of France, crowding to their &s;tand|ards under able and experienced officers, they acquired military &s;kill by degrees, and added all the advantages of that to the efforts of undaunted courage. The Duke of Mecklenburgh, notwith&s;tanding the &s;evere blow which he had given the Magdeburghers, not daring to inve&s;t a town &s;trongly fortified, and defended by &s;uch a garri&s;on, continued to ravage the open country.</P>
<P>AS the hopes of booty drew many adventurers to his camp, Maurice of Saxony began to be jealous of the power which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by being at the head of &s;uch a numerous body, and marching towards Magdeburgh with his own troops, a&s;&s;umed the &s;upreme command of the whole army, an honour to which his high rank and great abilities, as well as the nomination of the Diet, gave him an indi&s;putable title. With this united force he inve&s;ted the town, and began the &s;iege in form; claiming great merit with the Emperor on that account, as, from his zeal to execute the Imperial decree, he was expo&s;ing him&s;elf once more to the cen&s;ures and male|dictions of the party with which he agreed in religious &s;entiments. But the approaches to the town went on &s;lowly; the garri&s;on interrupted the be&s;iegers by fre|quent &s;allies, in one of which the Duke of Mecklen|burgh was taken pri&s;oner, levelled part of their works, and cut off the &s;oldiers in their advanced po&s;ts. While the citizens of Magdeburgh, animated by the di&s;cour&s;es of their pa&s;tors, and the &s;oldiers encouraged by the ex|ample of their officers, endured all the hard&s;hips of a &s;iege without murmuring, and defended them&s;elves with the &s;ame ardour which they had at fir&s;t di&s;covered; the troops of the be&s;iegers acted with extreme remi&s;&s;ne&s;s, repining at every thing they &s;uffered in a &s;ervice which they di&s;liked. They broke out more than once, into open mutiny, demanding the arrears of their pay, which, as the Germans contributed with great reluctance to|wards defraying the expences of this war, amounted to a con&s;iderable &s;um <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Thuan. 277.

<PB N="175" REF="011837_0994_0F9D88EEEEEA19F0">
which induced him not to pu&s;h the &s;iege with vigour, and made him choo&s;e rather to continue at the head of an army expo&s;ed to all the imputations which his dila|tory proceedings drew upon him, than to precipitate a conque&s;t which might have brought him &s;ome acce&s;&s;ion of reputation, but would have rendered it nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;band his forces.</P>
<P>AT la&s;t, the inhabitants of the town beginning to &s;uf|fer di&s;tre&s;s from want of provi&s;ions, and Maurice, find|ing it impo&s;&s;ible to protract matters any longer without filling the Emperor with &s;uch &s;u&s;picions as might have di&s;concerted all his mea&s;ures, he concluded a treaty of capitulation with the city upon the following conditions; That the Magdeburghers &s;hould humbly implore par|don of the Emperor; that they &s;hould not for the fu|ture take arms, or enter into any alliance again&s;t the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria; that they &s;hould &s;ubmit to the au|thority of the Imperial chamber; that they &s;hould con|form to the decree of the Diet at Aug&s;burgh with re&s;pect to religion; that the new fortifications added to the town &s;hould be demoli&s;hed; that they &s;hould pay a fine of fifty thou&s;and crowns, deliver up twelve pieces of ordnance to the Emperor, and &s;et the Duke of Meck|lenburgh, together with their other pri&s;oners at liberty without ran&s;om. Next day their garri&s;on marched out, and Maurice took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town with great mi|litary pomp.</P>
<P>BEFORE the terms of capitulation were &s;ettled, Mau|rice had held many conferences with Albert Count Mansfeldt, who had the chief command in Magdeburgh, and with Count Heideck, an officer who had &s;erved with great reputation in the army of the league of Smalkalde, whom the Emperor had pro&s;cribed on ac|count of his zeal for that cau&s;e, and whom Maurice had, notwith&s;tanding, &s;ecretly engaged in his &s;ervice, and admitted into the mo&s;t intimate confidence. To them he communicated a &s;cheme, which he had long revolved in his mind, for procuring liberty to his father-in-law the Landgrave, for vindicating the privileges of the Germanic body, and &s;etting bounds to the dange|rous encroachments of the Imperial power. Having con&s;ulted with them about the mea&s;ures which might
<PB N="176" REF="011837_0995_0F9D88EFB669D328">
be nece&s;&s;ary for &s;ecuring the &s;ucce&s;s of &s;uch an arduous enterprize, he gave Mansfeldt &s;ecret a&s;&s;urances that the fortifications of Magdeburgh &s;hould not be de&s;troyed, and that the inhabitants &s;hould neither be di&s;turbed in the exerci&s;e of their religion, nor be deprived of any of their antient immunities. In order to engage Maurice more thoroughly from con&s;iderations of intere&s;t to fulfil the&s;e engagements, the &s;enate of Magdeburgh elected him their Burgrave, a dignity which had formerly be|longed to the Electoral hou&s;e of Saxony, and which in|titled him to a very ample juri&s;diction not only in the ci|ty, but in its dependencies <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 528.

<P>THUS the citizens of Magdeburgh, after enduring a &s;iege of twelve months, and &s;truggling for their liber|ties, religious and civil, with an invincible fortitude, worthy of the cau&s;e in which it was exerted, had at la&s;t the good fortune to conclude a treaty which left them in a better condition than the re&s;t of their countrymen, whom their timidity, or want of public &s;pirit, had be|trayed into &s;uch mean &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to the Emperor. But while a great part of Germany applauded the gallant conduct of the Magdeburghers, and rejoiced in their hav|ing e&s;caped the de&s;truction with which they had been threatened, all admired Maurice's addre&s;s in the con|duct of his negociation with them, as well as the dexte|rity with which he converted every event to his own advantage. They &s;aw, with amazement, that after hav|ing afflicted the Magdeburghers during many months with all the calamities of war, he was at la&s;t, by their voluntary election, ve&s;ted with &s;upreme authority in that city which he had &s;o lately be&s;ieged; that after having been &s;o long the object of their invectives and &s;atire as an apo&s;tate, and an enemy to the religion which he pro|fe&s;&s;ed; they &s;eemed now to place unbounded confidence in his zeal and good will <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Arnoldi vita Maurit. apud Menken, ii. 1227.</NOTE>. At the &s;ame time, the pub|lic articles in the treaty of capitulation were &s;o perfectly conformable to tho&s;e which the Emperor had granted to the other Prote&s;tant cities, and Maurice took &s;uch care to magnify his merit in having reduced a place which
<PB N="177" REF="011837_0996_0F9D88F070697E60">
had defended it&s;elf with &s;o much ob&s;tinacy, that Charles, far from &s;u&s;pecting any thing fraudulent, or collu&s;ive in the terms of accommodation, ratified them without he|&s;itation, and ab&s;olved the Magdeburghers from the &s;en|tence of ban which had been denounced again&s;t them.</P>
<P>THE only point that now remained to embarra&s;s Mau|rice was how to keep together the veteran troops which had &s;erved under him, as well as tho&s;e which had been employed in the defence of the town. For this, too, he found an expedient with &s;ingular art and felicity. His &s;chemes again&s;t the Emperor were not yet &s;o fully ripen|ed, that he dur&s;t venture to di&s;clo&s;e them, and proceed openly to carry them into execution. The winter was approaching, which made it impo&s;&s;ible to take the field immediately. He was afraid that it would give a pre|mature alarm to the Emperor, if he &s;hould retain &s;uch a con&s;iderable body in his pay until the &s;ea&s;on of action returned in the &s;pring. As &s;oon then as Magdeburgh opened its gates, he &s;ent home his Saxon &s;ubjects, whom he could command to take arms and re-a&s;&s;emble on the &s;horte&s;t warning, to their own habitations; and at the &s;ame time, paying part of the arrears due to the merce|nary troops, who had followed his &s;tandard, as well as to the &s;oldiers who had &s;erved in the garri&s;on, he ab|&s;olved them from their re&s;pective oaths of fidelity, and di&s;banded them. But the moment he gave them their di&s;charge, George Duke of Mecklenburgh, who was now &s;et at liberty, offered to take them into his &s;ervice, and to become &s;urety for the payment of what was &s;till owing to them. As &s;uch adventurers were accu&s;tomed often to change ma&s;ters, they in&s;tantly accepted the of|fer. Thus, the&s;e troops were kept united, and ready to march wherever Maurice &s;hould call them, while the Emperor, deceived by this artifice, and imagining that the Duke of Mecklenburgh had hired them with an inten|tion to a&s;&s;ert, by force of arms, his claim to a part of his brother's territories, &s;uffered it to pa&s;s without ob|&s;ervation, as if it had been a matter of no con&s;equence <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Thuan. 278.

<P><PB N="178" REF="011837_0997_0F9D88F2327BD7E8">HAVING ventured to take the&s;e &s;teps which were of &s;o much con&s;equence towards the execution of his &s;chemes, Maurice, that he might divert the Emperor from ob&s;erving their tendency too narrowly, and pre|vent the &s;u&s;picions which that mu&s;t have excited, &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of employing &s;ome new artifice in order to engage his attention, and to confirm him in his pre&s;ent &s;ecurity. As he knew that the chief object of the Em|peror's &s;olicitude at this juncture, was how he might prevail with the Prote&s;tant &s;tates of Germany to recog|nize the authority of the council of Trent, and to &s;end thither amba&s;&s;adors in their own name, as well as de|puties from their re&s;pective churches, he took hold of this predominating pa&s;&s;ion, in order to amu&s;e and to deceive him. He affected a wonderful zeal to gratify Charles in what he de&s;ired with regard to this matter; he nominated amba&s;&s;adors, whom he impowered to at|tend the council; he made choice of Melancthon, and &s;ome of the mo&s;t eminent among his brethren, to pre|pare a confe&s;&s;ion of faith, and to lay it before that a&s;&s;embly. After his example, and probably in con&s;equence of his &s;olicitations, the Duke of Wurtemberg, the city of Stra&s;burgh, and other Prote&s;tant &s;tates appointed am|ba&s;&s;adors and divines to attend the council. They all applied to the Emperor for his &s;afe-conduct, which they obtained in the mo&s;t ample form. This was deem|ed &s;ufficient for the &s;ecurity of the amba&s;&s;adors, and they proceeded accordingly on their journey; but a &s;e|parate &s;afe-conduct from the council it&s;elf, was demand|ed for the Prote&s;tant divines. The fate of John Hu&s;s and Jerome of Prague, whom the council of Con&s;tance, in the preceding century, had condemned to the flames without regarding the Imperial &s;afe-conduct, which had been granted them, rendered this precaution prudent and nece&s;&s;ary. But as the Pope was no le&s;s unwilling that the Prote&s;tants &s;hould be admitted to an hearing in the council, than the Emperor had been eager in bring|ing them to demand it, the legate by promi&s;es and threats prevailed on the fathers of the council to decline i&s;&s;uing a &s;afe-conduct in the &s;ame form with that which the council of Ba&s;il had granted to the followers of Hu&s;s. The Prote&s;tants, on their part, in&s;i&s;ted upon the
<PB N="179" REF="011837_0998_0F9D88F2B6E30A68">
council's copying the preci&s;e words of that in&s;trument. The Imperial amba&s;&s;adors interpo&s;ed in order to obtain what would &s;atisfy them. Alterations in the form of the writ were propo&s;ed; expedients were &s;ugge&s;ted; pro|te&s;ts and counter-prote&s;ts were taken; the legate, toge|ther with his a&s;&s;ociates laboured to gain their point by artifice and chicane; the Prote&s;tants adhered to theirs with firmne&s;s and ob&s;tinacy. An account of every thing that pa&s;&s;ed in Trent was tran&s;mitted to the Emperor at In&s;pruck, who, attempting from an exce&s;s of zeal, or of confidence in his own addre&s;s, to reconcile the con|tending parties, was involved in a labyrinth of inextri|cable negociations. By means of this, however, Mau|rice gained all that he had in view; the Emperor's time was wholely engro&s;&s;ed, and his attention diverted; while he had lei&s;ure to mature his &s;chemes, to carry on his in|trigues, and to fini&s;h his preparations before he threw off the ma&s;k, and &s;truck the blow which he had &s;o long meditated <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 526, 529.

When Solyman, in the year 1541, by a &s;tratagem, which &s;uited the ba&s;e and in&s;idious policy of a petty u&s;urper, rather than the magnanimity of a mighty conqueror, deprived the young King of Hungary of the dominions which his fa|ther had left him, he had granted that unfortunate Prince the country of Tran&s;ylvania, a province of his paternal kingdom. The government of this, together with the care of educating the young King, for he &s;till allowed him to retain that title, though he had rendered it only an empty name, he committed to the Queen and Mar|tinuzzi, bi&s;hop of Waradin, whom the late King had appointed his &s;on's guardians, and regents of his domi|nions, at a time when tho&s;e offices were of greater im|portance. This co-ordinate juri&s;diction occa&s;ioned the &s;ame di&s;&s;en&s;ions in a &s;mall principality, as it would have excited in a great kingdom; an ambitious young Queen, con&s;cious of her capacity for governing, and an high

&s;pirited prelate, contending who &s;hould engro&s;s the greate&s;t &s;hare in the admini&s;tration. Each had their par|tizans among the nobles, but as Martinuzzi, by his great talents, began to acquire the a&s;cendant, I&s;abella turned his own arts again&s;t him, and courted the protection of the Turks.</P>
<P>THE neighbouring Ba&s;has, jealous of the bi&s;hop's power, as well as abilities, readily promi&s;ed her the aid which &s;he demanded, and would &s;oon have obliged Martinuzzi to have given up to her the &s;ole direction of affairs, if his ambition, fertile in expedients, had not &s;ugge&s;ted to him a new mea&s;ure, and one that tended not only to pre&s;erve but to enlarge his authority. Hav|ing concluded an agreement with the Queen, by the mediation of &s;ome of the nobles who were &s;olicitous to &s;ave their country from the calamities of a civil war, he &s;ecretly di&s;patched one of his confidents to Vienna, and entered into a negociation with Ferdinand. As it was no difficult matter to per&s;uade Ferdinand, that the &s;ame man who&s;e enmity and intrigues had driven him out of a great part of his Hungarian dominions, might, upon a reconciliation, become equally in&s;trumental in recover|ing them, he li&s;tened eagerly to the fir&s;t overtures of an union with that prelate. Martinuzzi allured him by &s;uch pro&s;pects of advantage, and engaged, with &s;o much confidence, that he would prevail on the mo&s;t powerful of the Hungarian nobles to take arms in his favour, that Ferdinand, notwith&s;tanding his truce with Solyman, agreed to invade Tran&s;ylvania. The command of the troops de&s;tined for that &s;ervice, con&s;i&s;ting of veteran Spani&s;h and German &s;oldiers, was given to Ca&s;taldo Marquis de Piadena, an officer formed by the famous Marquis de Pe&s;cara, whom he &s;trongly re&s;embled both in his enterprizing genius for civil bu&s;ine&s;s, and in his great knowledge in the art of war. This army, more formidable by the di&s;cipline of the &s;oldiers, and the abi|lities of the general, than by its number, was powerful|ly &s;econded by Martinuzzi and his faction among the Hungarians. As the Turki&s;h Ba&s;has, the Sultan him|&s;elf being at the head of his army, on the frontiers of Per&s;ia, could not afford the Queen &s;uch immediate or effectual a&s;&s;i&s;tance as the exigency of her affairs required,

&s;he quickly lo&s;t all hopes of being able to retain any longer the authority which &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed as regent, and even began to de&s;pair of her &s;on's &s;afety.</P>
<P>MARTINUZZI did not &s;uffer this favourable opportu|nity of accompli&s;hing his own de&s;igns to pa&s;s unimprov|ed, and ventured, while &s;he was in this &s;tate of dejection, to lay before her a propo&s;al, which, at any other time, &s;he would have rejected with di&s;dain. He repre&s;ented how impo&s;&s;ible it was for her to re&s;i&s;t Ferdinand's victo|rious arms; that even if the Turks &s;hould enable her to make head again&s;t them, &s;he would be far from changing her condition to the better, and could not con|&s;ider them as deliverers, but as ma&s;ters to who&s;e com|mands &s;he mu&s;t &s;ubmit; he conjured her, therefore, as &s;he regarded her own dignity, the &s;afety of her &s;on, or the &s;ecurity of Chri&s;tendom, rather to give up Tran&s;yl|vania to Ferdinand, and to make over to him her &s;on's title to the crown of Hungary, than to allow both to be u&s;urped by the inveterate enemy of the Chri&s;tian faith. At the &s;ame time, he promi&s;ed her, in Ferdinand's name, a compen&s;ation for her&s;elf, as well as for her &s;on, &s;uit|able to their rank, and proportional to the value of what they were to &s;acrifice. I&s;abella, de&s;erted by &s;ome of her adherents, di&s;tru&s;ting others, de&s;titute of friends, and &s;urrounded by Ca&s;taldo's and Martinuzzi's troops, &s;ub|&s;cribed, though with a reluctant hand, the&s;e hard con|ditions. Upon this, &s;he &s;urrendered &s;uch places of &s;trength as were &s;till in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;he gave up all the en&s;igns of royalty, particularly a crown of gold, which, as the Hungarians believed, had de&s;cended from heaven, and conferred on him who wore it, an un|doubted right to the throne. As &s;he could not bear to remain a private per&s;on, in a country where &s;he once enjoyed &s;overeign power, &s;he in&s;tantly &s;et out with her &s;on for Sile&s;ia, in order to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the princi|palities of Oppelen and Ratibor, the inve&s;titure of which Ferdinand had engaged to grant her &s;on, and likewi&s;e to be&s;tow one of his daughters upon him in marriage.</P>
<P>UPON the re&s;ignation of the young King, Martinuzzi, and after his example the re&s;t of the Tran&s;ylvanian gran|dees, &s;wore allegiance to Ferdinand; who, in order to te&s;tify his grateful &s;en&s;e of the zeal as well as &s;ucce&s;s

with which that prelate had &s;erved him, affected to di&s;|tingui&s;h him by every po&s;&s;ible mark of favour and con|fidence. He appointed him governor of Tran&s;ylvania, with almo&s;t unlimited authority; he ordered Ca&s;taldo to pay the greate&s;t deference to his opinion and com|mands; he increa&s;ed his revenues, which were already very great, by new appointments; he nominated him archbi&s;hop of Gran, and prevailed on the Pope to rai&s;e him to the dignity of a Cardinal. All this o&s;tentation of good will, however, was void of &s;incerity, and calcu|lated to conceal &s;entiments the mo&s;t perfectly its rever&s;e. Ferdinand dreaded Martinuzzi's abilities; di&s;tru&s;ted his fidelity; and fore&s;aw, that as his exten&s;ive authority enabled him to check any attempt towards circum&s;crib|ing or aboli&s;hing the exten&s;ive privileges which the Hun|garian nobles po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, he would &s;tand forth, on every occa&s;ion, the guardian of the liberties of his country, rather than act the part of a viceroy devoted to the will of his Sovereign.</P>
<P>FOR this rea&s;on, he &s;ecretly gave it in charge to Ca|&s;taldo, to watch his motions, to guard again&s;t his de|&s;igns, and to thwart his mea&s;ures. But Martinuzzi, ei|ther becau&s;e he did not perceive that Ca&s;taldo was placed as a &s;py on his actions, or becau&s;e he de&s;pi&s;ed Ferdi|nand's in&s;idious arts, a&s;&s;umed the direction of the war again&s;t the Turks with his u&s;ual tone of authority, and conducted it with great magnanimity, and no le&s;s &s;uc|ce&s;s. He recovered &s;ome places of which the Infidels had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; he rendered their attempts to re|duce others abortive; and e&s;tabli&s;hed Ferdinand's au|thority not only in Tran&s;ylvania, but in the Bannat of Teme&s;war, and &s;everal of the countries adjacent. In carrying on the&s;e operations, he often differed in &s;enti|ments from Ca&s;taldo and his officers, and treated the Turki&s;h pri&s;oners with a degree of humanity, and even of genero&s;ity, which Ca&s;taldo loudly condemned. This was repre&s;ented at Vienna as an artful method of court|ing the friend&s;hip of the Infidels, that, by &s;ecuring their protection, he might &s;hake off all dependence upon the Sovereign whom he now acknowledged. Though Mar|tinuzzi, in ju&s;tification of his own conduct, contended that it was impolitic to exa&s;perate, by unnece&s;&s;ary &s;eve|rities,
<PB N="183" REF="011837_1002_0F9D88F5B2B84890">
an enemy prone to revenge, Ca&s;taldo's accu&s;a|tions gained credit with Ferdinand, prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed already again&s;t Martinuzzi, and jealous of every thing that could endanger his authority in Hungary, in proportion as he knew it to be precarious and ill e&s;tabli&s;hed. The&s;e &s;u&s;picions, Ca&s;taldo confirmed and &s;trengthened, by the intelligence which he tran&s;mitted continually to his con|fidents at Vienna. By mi&s;repre&s;enting what was inno|cent, and putting the wor&s;t con&s;truction on what &s;eem|ed dubious in Martinuzzi's conduct; by imputing to him de&s;igns which he never formed, and charging him with actions of which he was not guilty; he at la&s;t convinced Ferdinand, that, in order to pre&s;erve his Hungarian crown, he mu&s;t cut off that ambitious pre|late. But Ferdinand, fore&s;eeing that it would be dan|gerous to proceed in the regular cour&s;e of law again&s;t a &s;ubject of &s;uch exorbitant power, as enabled him to &s;et his Sovereign at defiance, determined to employ violence in order to obtain that &s;atisfaction, which the laws were too feeble to afford him.</P>
<P>HE i&s;&s;ued his orders accordingly to Ca&s;taldo, who willingly undertook that infamous &s;ervice. Having com|municated the de&s;ign to &s;ome Italian and Spani&s;h offi|cers whom he could tru&s;t, and concerted with them the plan of executing it; they entered Martinuzzi's apart|ment&punc; early one morning, under pretence of pre&s;enting to him &s;ome di&s;patches which were to be &s;ent off imme|diately to Vienna; and while he peru&s;ed a paper with attention, one of their number &s;truck him with his poniard in the throat. The blow was not mortal; Mar|tinuzzi &s;tarted up with the intrepidity natural to him, and grappling the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, threw him to the ground; but the other con&s;pirators ru&s;hing in, an old man, unarmed, and alone, could not long &s;u&s;tain &s;uch an unequal con|flict, but &s;unk under the wounds which he received from &s;o many hands. The dread of the foreign troops re&s;trained the Tran&s;ylvanians from ri&s;ing in arms, in or|der to take vengeance on the murderers of a prelate, who had long been the object of their love as well as ve|neration. They &s;poke of the deed, however, with hor|ror and execration; and exclaimed again&s;t Ferdinand,
<PB N="184" REF="011837_1003_0F9D88F672BA8E98">
whom neither gratitude for recent and important &s;er|vices, nor reverence for a character con&s;idered as &s;acred and inviolable among Chri&s;tians, could re&s;train from &s;hedding the blood of a man, who&s;e only crime was at|tachment to his native country. The nobles, dete&s;ting the jealous as well as cruel policy of a court, which, upon uncertain and improbable &s;urmi&s;es, had given up a per&s;on no le&s;s con&s;picuous for his merit than his rank, to be butchered by a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, either retired to their own e&s;tates, or, if they continued with the Au&s;trian army, grew cold to the &s;ervice. The Turks, encouraged by the death of an enemy who&s;e abilities they knew and dreaded, prepared to renew ho&s;tilities early in the &s;pring; and, in&s;tead of the &s;ecurity which Ferdinand had ex|pected from the removal of Martinuzzi, it was evident that his territories in Hungary were about to be attacked with greater vigour, and defended with le&s;s zeal than ever <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 535.

<P>MEANWHILE, Maurice having almo&s;t fini&s;hed his in|trigues and preparations, was on the point of declaring his intentions openly, and of taking the field again&s;t the Emperor. His fir&s;t care, after he came to this re&s;olu|tion, was to di&s;claim that narrow and bigotted maxim of the confederates of Smalkalde, which had led them to &s;hun all connection with foreigners. He had ob&s;erv|ed how fatal this had been to their cau&s;e; and in&s;truct|ed by their error, he was as eager to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">urt the pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">|tion of Henry II. as they had been &s;olicitous to prevent the interpo&s;ition of Francis I. Happily for him he found Henry in a di&s;po&s;ition to li&s;ten to the fir&s;t overture on his part, and in a &s;ituation which enabled him to bring the whole force of the French monarchy into action. Henry had long ob&s;erved the progre&s;s of the Emperor's arms with jealou&s;y, and wi&s;hed to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf by trying his &s;trength again&s;t the &s;ame enemy, whom it had been the glory of his father's reign to oppo&s;e. He had laid hold on the fir&s;t opportunity in his power of thwarting the Emperor's de&s;igns, by taking the Duke of Parma under his protection; and ho&s;tilities were alrea|dy

begun, not only in that dutchy, but in Piedmont. Having terminated the war with England by a peace, no le&s;s advantageous to him&s;elf, than honourable for his allies the Scots, the re&s;tle&s;s and enterprizing courage of his nobles was impatient to di&s;play it&s;elf on &s;ome theatre of action more con&s;picuous than the petty operations in Parma or Piedmont afforded them.</P>
<P>JOHN DE FIESSE, bi&s;hop of Bayonne, whom Henry bad &s;ent into Germany, under pretence of hiring troops to be employed in Italy, was empowered to conclude a treaty in form with Maurice and his a&s;&s;ociates. As it would have been very indecent in a King of France to have undertaken the defence of the Prote&s;tant church, the intere&s;ts of religion, how much &s;oever they might be affected by the treaty, were not once mentioned in any of the articles. Religious concerns they pretended to commit entirely to the di&s;po&s;ition of Divine Provi|dence; the only motives a&s;&s;igned for their pre&s;ent con|federacy again&s;t Charles were to procure the Landgrave liberty, and to prevent the &s;ubver&s;ion of the antient con&s;titution and laws of the German empire. In order to accompli&s;h the&s;e ends, it was agreed, that all the contracting parties &s;hould, at the &s;ame time, declare war again&s;t the Emperor; that neither peace nor truce &s;hould be made but by common con&s;ent, nor without including each of the confederates; that, in order to guard again&s;t the inconveniencies of anarchy, or of pre|ten&s;ions to joint command, Maurice &s;hould be acknow|ledged as head of the German confederates, with ab&s;o|lute authority in all military affairs; that Maurice and his a&s;&s;ociates &s;hould bring into the field &s;even thou&s;and hor&s;e, with a proportionable number of infantry; that towards the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of this army, during the three fir&s;t months of the war, Henry &s;hould contribute two hundred and forty thou&s;and crowns, and afterwards &s;ix|ty thou&s;and crowns a month, as long as they continued in arms; that Henry &s;hould attack the Emperor on the &s;ide of Lorrain with a powerful army; that if it were found requi&s;ite to elect a new Emperor, &s;uch a per&s;on &s;hould be nominated as &s;hall be agreeable to the King of France <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Recueil des Traites, tom. ii. 258.

October, &s;ome time before Magdeburgh &s;urrendered, and the preparatory negociations were conducted with &s;uch profound &s;ecrecy, that of all the Princes who after|wards acceded to it, Maurice communicated what he was carrying on to two only, John Albert, the reigning Duke of Mecklenburgh, and William of He&s;&s;e, the Landgrave's elde&s;t &s;on. The league it&s;elf was no le&s;s anxiou&s;ly concealed, and with &s;uch fortunate care, that no rumour concerning it reached the ears of the Empe|ror or his mini&s;ters, nor do they &s;eem to have conceiv|ed the mo&s;t di&s;tant &s;u&s;picion of &s;uch a tran&s;action.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time Maurice, with a &s;olicitude which was careful to draw &s;ome acce&s;&s;ion of &s;trength from eve|ry quarter, applied to Edward VI. of England, and re|que&s;ted a &s;ub&s;idy of four hundred thou&s;and crowns for the &s;upport of a confederacy formed in defence of the Prote&s;tant religion. But the factions which prevailed in the Engli&s;h court during the minority of that Prince, and which deprived both the councils and arms of the nation of their wonted vigour, left the Engli&s;h mini|&s;ters neither time or inclination to attend to foreign af|fairs, and prevented Maurice's obtaining that aid, which their zeal for the Reformation would have prompted them to grant him <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Burnet's Hi&s;t. of the Reform. vol. ii. Append. 37.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MAURICE, however, having &s;ecured the protection of &s;uch a powerful Monarch as Henry II. proceeded with great confidence, but with equal caution, to exe|cute his plan. As he judged it nece&s;&s;ary to make one effort more, in order to obtain the Emperor's con&s;ent that the Landgrave &s;hould be &s;et at liberty, he &s;ent a &s;olemn emba&s;&s;y, in his own name, and in that of the Elector of Brandenburgh, to In&s;pruck. After re&s;uming, at great length, all the facts and arguments upon which they founded their claim, and repre&s;enting in the &s;trong|e&s;t terms, the peculiar engagements which bound them to be &s;o a&s;&s;iduous in their &s;olicitations, they renewed the reque&s;t in behalf of the unfortunate pri&s;oner, which they had &s;o often preferred in vain. The Elector Pala|tine, the Duke of Wurtemberg, the Dukes of Mecklen|burgh, the Duke of Deuxponts, the Marquis of Bran|denburgh
<PB N="187" REF="011837_1006_0F9D88F8B1EFC488">
Bareith, and the Marquis of Baden, by their amba&s;&s;adors, concurred with them in their &s;uit. Letters were likewi&s;e delivered to the &s;ame effect from the King of Denmark, the Duke of Bavaria, and the Dukes of Lunenburgh. Even the King of the Romans, moved with compa&s;&s;ion towards the Landgrave in his wretched &s;ituation, or influenced, perhaps, by a &s;ecret jealou&s;y of his brother's power and de&s;igns, which, &s;ince his attempt to alter the order of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the empire, he had come to view with other eyes, and dreaded to a great degree, joined in this application.</P>
<P>BUT Charles, con&s;tant to his own &s;y&s;tem, with re|gard to the Landgrave, eluded a demand urged by &s;uch powerful interce&s;&s;ors; and having declared, That he would communicate his re&s;olution concerning the mat|ter to Maurice, as &s;oon as he arrived at In&s;pruck, where he was every day expected, he did not deign to de&s;cend into any more particular explication of his intentions <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 531. Thuan. lib. viii. 280.</NOTE>. This application, though of no benefit to the Land|grave, was of great advantage to Maurice. It &s;erved to ju&s;tify his &s;ub&s;equent proceedings, and to demon|&s;trate the nece&s;&s;ity of employing arms in order to extort that equitable conce&s;&s;ion, which his mediation or intrea|ty could not obtain. It was of u&s;e, too, to confirm the Emperor in his &s;ecurity, as both the &s;olemnity of the ap|plication, and the &s;olicitude with which &s;o many Princes were drawn in to enforce it, led him to conclude, that Maurice placed all his hopes of re&s;toring the Landgrave to liberty, in gaining his con&s;ent to di&s;mi&s;s him.</P>
<P>MAURICE employed artifices &s;till more refined to conceal his machinations, to amu&s;e the Emperor, and to gain time. He affected to be more &s;olicitous than ever to find out &s;ome expedient for removing the difficulties with regard to the &s;afe-conduct for the Prote&s;tant divines appointed to attend the council, &s;o that they might repair thither with &s;afety. His amba&s;&s;adors at Trent had frequent conferences concerning this matter, with the Imperial amba&s;&s;adors in that city, and laid open their &s;entiments to them with the appearance of the mo&s;t unre&s;erved con|fidence. He was willing, at la&s;t, to have it believed,
<PB N="188" REF="011837_1007_0F9D88F96F6CCAF8">
that he thought all differences with re&s;pect to this preli|minary article were on the point of being adju&s;ted; and, in order to give credit to this opinion, he commanded Melancthon, together with his brethren, to &s;et out on their journey to Trent. At the &s;ame time, he held a clo&s;e corre&s;pondence with the Imperial court at In&s;pruck, and renewed on every occa&s;ion his profe&s;&s;ions of fidelity and attachment to the Emperor. He talked continual|ly of his intention of going to In&s;pruck in per&s;on; he ordered a hou&s;e to be hired for him in that city, and to be fitted up with the greate&s;t di&s;patch for his recep|tion <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Arnoldi vita Maurit. ap. Menken, ii. 1229.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT, profoundly &s;killed as Maurice was in the arts of deceit, and impenetrable as he thought the veil to be under which he concealed his de&s;igns, there were &s;everal things in his conduct which alarmed the Emperor amid&s;t his &s;ecurity, and tempted him frequently to &s;u&s;pect that he was meditating &s;omething extraordinary. As the&s;e &s;u&s;picions took their ri&s;e from circum&s;tances incon&s;ider|able in them&s;elves, or of an ambiguous as well as un|certain nature, they were more than counterbalanced by Maurice's addre&s;s; and the Emperor would not, lightly, give up his confidence in a man, whom he had once tru&s;ted and loaded with favours. One particular alone &s;eemed to be of &s;uch con&s;equence, that he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to demand an explanation with regard to it. The troops, which George of Mecklenburgh had taken into pay after the capitulation of Magdeburgh, having fixed their quarters in Thuringia, lived at di&s;cretion on the lands of the rich eccle&s;ia&s;tics in their neighbourhood. Their licence and rapaciou&s;ne&s;s were intolerable. Such as felt or dreaded their exactions, complained loudly to the Emperor, and repre&s;ented them as a body of men kept in readine&s;s for &s;ome de&s;perate enterprize. But Maurice, partly by extenuating the enormities of which they had been guilty, partly by repre&s;enting the impo&s;|&s;ibility of di&s;banding the&s;e troops, or of keeping them to regular di&s;cipline, unle&s;s the arrears &s;till due to them, by the Emperor, were paid, either removed the appre|hen&s;ions which this had occa&s;ioned, or as Charles was

not in a condition to &s;atisfy the demands of the&s;e &s;ol|diers, obliged him to be &s;ilent with regard to the mat|ter <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 549. Thuan. 339.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE time of action was now approaching. Maurice had privately di&s;patched Albert of Brandenburgh to Pa|ris, in order to confirm his league with Henry, and to ha&s;ten the march of the French army. He had taken mea&s;ures to bring his own &s;ubjects together on the fir&s;t &s;ummons; he had provided for the &s;ecurity of Saxony, while he &s;hould be ab&s;ent with the army; and he held the troops in Thuringia, on which he chiefly depended, ready to advance on a moment's warning. All the&s;e complicated operations were carried on without being di&s;covered by the court at In&s;pruck, and the Emperor remained there in perfect tranquillity, bu&s;ied entirely in counteracting the intrigues of the Pope's lega<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e at Trent, and in &s;ettling the conditions on which the Prote&s;tant divines &s;hould be admitted into the council, as if there had not been any tran&s;action of greater moment in agi|tation.</P>
<P>THIS credulous &s;ecurity in a Prince, who&s;e &s;agacity in ob&s;erving the conduct of all around him, commonly led him to an exce&s;s of di&s;tru&s;t, may &s;eem unaccount|able, and has been imputed to infatuation. But be&s;ides, the exqui&s;ite addre&s;s with which Maurice concealed his intentions, two circum&s;tances contributed to the delu|&s;ion. The gout returned upon Charles &s;oon after his ar|rival at In&s;pruck, with an increa&s;e of violence; and his con&s;titution being broken by &s;uch frequent attacks, he was &s;eldom able to exert his natural vigour of mind, or to con&s;ider affairs with his u&s;ual vigilance and penetra|tion; and Granvelle, bi&s;hop of Arras, his prime mini|&s;ter, though one of the mo&s;t &s;ubtle &s;tate&s;men of that, or perhaps of any age, was on this occa&s;ion the dupe of his own craft. He entertained &s;uch an high opinion of his own abilities, and held the political talents of the Germans in &s;uch contempt, that he de&s;pi&s;ed all the inti|mations given him concerning Maurice's &s;ecret machi|nations, or the dangerous de&s;igns which he was carrying on. When the Duke of Alva, who&s;e dark &s;u&s;picious
<PB N="190" REF="011837_1009_0F9D88FAF0378950">
mind harboured many doubts concerning the Elector's &s;incerity, propo&s;ed calling him immediately to court, to an&s;wer for his conduct, he replied with great &s;corn, That the&s;e apprehen&s;ions were groundle&s;s, and that a drunken German head was too gro&s;s to form any &s;cheme which he could not ea&s;ily penetrate and baffle. Nor did he a&s;|&s;ume this peremptory tone merely from confidence in his own di&s;cernment; he had bribed two of Maurice's mini&s;ters, and received from them frequent and minute information concerning all their ma&s;ter's motions. But through this very channel, by which he expected to gain acce&s;s to all Maurice's coun&s;els, and even to his thoughts, &s;uch intelligence was conveyed to him as completed his deception. Maurice fortunately di&s;cover|ed the corre&s;pondence of the two traitors with Gran|velle, and in&s;tead of puni&s;hing them for their crime, he dextrou&s;ly availed him&s;elf of their fraud, and turned his own arts again&s;t the bi&s;hop. He affected to treat the&s;e mini&s;ters with greater confidence than ever; he admit|ted them to his con&s;ultations, and &s;eemed to lay open his heart to them; and taking care all the while to let them be acquainted with nothing but what it was his intere&s;t &s;hould be known, they tran&s;mitted to In&s;pruck &s;uch accounts as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Granvelle with a firm belief of his &s;incerity and good intentions <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Melvil. Memoirs, fol. edit. p. 12.</NOTE>. The Emperor him|&s;elf, in the fulne&s;s of &s;ecurity, was &s;o little moved by a memorial, in name of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical electors, ad|moni&s;hing him to be on his guard again&s;t Maurice, that he made light of this intelligence; and his an&s;wer to them abounds with declarations of his entire and confi|dent reliance on the fidelity as well as attachment of that Prince <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Sleid 535.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AT la&s;t Maurice's preparations were completed, and he had the &s;atisfaction to find that his intrigues and de|&s;igns were &s;till unknown. But, though now ready to take the field, he did not lay a&s;ide the arts which he had hitherto employed; and by one piece of craft more, he deceived his enemies a few days longer. He gave out, that he was about to begin that journey to In&s;pruck of which he had &s;o often talked, and he took one of the
<PB N="191" REF="011837_1010_0F9D88FC95ED24D8">
mini&s;ters whom Granvelle had bribed to attend him thi|ther. After travelling po&s;t a few &s;tages, he pretended to be indi&s;po&s;ed by the fatigue of the journey, and di&s;|patching the &s;u&s;pected mini&s;ter to make his apology to the Emperor for this delay, and to a&s;&s;ure him that he would be at In&s;pruck within a few days; as &s;oon as this &s;py on his actions was gone, he mounted on hor&s;e|back, rode full &s;peed towards Thuringia, joined his ar|my, which amounted to twenty thou&s;and foot, and five thou&s;and hor&s;e, and put it immediately in motion <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Melv. Mem. p. 13. The&s;e circum&s;tances, concerning the Saxon mini&s;ters, whom Granvelle had bribed, are not mentioned by the German hi&s;torians; but, as Sir James Melvil received his information from the Elector Palatine, and as they are perfectly agreeable to the re&s;t of Maurice's conduct, they may be con&s;idered as authentic.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time he publi&s;hed a manife&s;to containing his rea&s;ons for taking arms. The&s;e were three in num|ber; That he might &s;ecure the Prote&s;tant religion, which was threatened with immediate de&s;truction; That he might maintain the con&s;titution and laws of the empire, and &s;ave Germany from being &s;ubjected to the domina|tion of an ab&s;olute Monarch; That he might deliver the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e from the mi&s;eries of a long and un|ju&s;t impri&s;onment. By the fir&s;t, he rouzed all the fa|vourers of the Reformation, a party formidable by their zeal as well as numbers, and rendered de&s;perate by op|pre&s;&s;ion. By the &s;econd, he intere&s;ted all the friends of liberty, Catholics as well as Prote&s;tants, and made it their intere&s;t to unite with him in a&s;&s;erting the rights and privileges common to both. The third, be&s;ides the glory which he acquired by his zeal to fulfil his engagements to the unhappy pri&s;oner, was become a cau&s;e of gene|ral concern, not only from the compa&s;&s;ion which the Landgrave's &s;ufferings excited, but from indignation at the inju&s;tice and rigour of the Emperor's proceedings again&s;t him. Together with Maurice's manife&s;to, an|other appeared in the name of Albert, Marquis of Bran|denburgh Culmbach, who had joined him with a body of adventurers, whom he had drawn together. The &s;ame grievances which Maurice had pointed out are mentioned in it, but with an exce&s;s of virulence and ani|mo&s;ity,
<PB N="192" REF="011837_1011_0F9D88FD30FD4A50">
&s;uitable to the character of the Prince in who&s;e name it was publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>THE King of France added to the&s;e a manife&s;to in his own name; in which, after taking notice of the antient alliance between the French and German nations, both de&s;cended from the &s;ame ance&s;tors; and after mention|ing the applications, which, in con&s;equence of this, &s;ome of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious among the German Princes had made to him for his protection; he declared, That he now took arms to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the antient con&s;titu|tion of the empire, to deliver &s;ome of its Princes from captivity, and to &s;ecure the privileges and independence of all the members of the Germanic body. In this ma|nife&s;to, Henry a&s;&s;umed the extraordinary title of <HI>Pro|tector of the Liberties of Germany, and of its captive Princes;</HI> and there was engraved on it a cap, the antient &s;ymbol of freedom, placed between two daggers, in or|der to intimate to the Germans, that this ble&s;&s;ing was to be acquired and &s;ecured by force of arms <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 549. Thuan. lib. x. 339. Mem. de Ribier. ii. 371.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MAURICE had now a very different part to act, but his flexible genius was capable of accommodating it&s;elf to every &s;ituation. The moment he took arms, he was as bold and enterprizing in the field, as he had been cau|tious and crafty in the cabinet. He advanced by rapid marches towards the Upper Germany. All the towns in his way opened their gates to him. He rein&s;tated the magi&s;trates whom the Emperor had depo&s;ed, and gave po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the churches to the Prote&s;tant mini|&s;ters whom he had ejected. He directed his march to Aug&s;burgh, and as the Imperial garri&s;on which was too incon&s;iderable to think of defending it, retired imme|diately, he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that great city, and made the &s;ame changes there, as in the towns through which he had pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>NO words can expre&s;s the Emperor's a&s;toni&s;hment and con&s;ternation at events &s;o unexpected. He &s;aw a great number of the German Princes in arms again&s;t him, and the re&s;t either ready to join them, or wi&s;hing &s;ucce&s;s to their enterprize. He beheld a powerful Mo|narch united with them in clo&s;e league, &s;econding their
<PB N="193" REF="011837_1012_0F9D88FDF7A54510">
operations in per&s;on at the head of a formidable army, while he, through negligence and credulity, which ex|po&s;ed him no le&s;s to &s;corn than to danger, had neither made, nor was in condition to make, any effectual pro|vi&s;ion either for cru&s;hing his rebellious &s;ubjects, or re|&s;i&s;ting the inva&s;ion of the foreign enemy. Part of his Spani&s;h troops had been ordered into Hungary again&s;t the Turks; the re&s;t had marched back to Italy upon oc|ca&s;ion of the war in the dutchy of Parma. The bands of veteran Germans had been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, becau&s;e he was not able to pay them; or had entered into Maurice's &s;ervice after the &s;iege of Magdeburgh; and he remained at In&s;pruck with a body of &s;oldiers, &s;carce &s;trong enough to guard his own per&s;on. His trea&s;ury was as much ex|hau&s;ted, as his army was reduced. He had received no remittances for &s;ome time from the new world. He had forfeited all credit with the merchants of Genoa and Venice, who refu&s;ed to lend him money, though tempt|ed by the offer of exorbitant intere&s;t. Thus, Charles, though undoubtedly the mo&s;t con&s;iderable potentate in Chri&s;tendom, and capable of exerting the greate&s;t &s;trength, (as his power, though violently attacked, was &s;till unimpaired) found him&s;elf in a &s;ituation which rendered him unable to make &s;uch a &s;udden and vigo|rous effort as the juncture required, and was nece&s;&s;ary to have &s;aved him from the pre&s;ent danger <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 555. Thuan. 342.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN this &s;ituation, he placed all his hopes on negociat|ing: the only re&s;ource of tho&s;e who are con&s;cious of their own weakne&s;s. But thinking it incon&s;i&s;tent with his dignity to make the fir&s;t advances to &s;ubjects who were in arms again&s;t him, he avoided that indecorum by employing the mediation of his brother Ferdinand. Maurice, confiding in his own talents to conduct any ne|gociation in &s;uch a manner as to derive advantage from it, and hoping that by the appearance of facility in hearkening to the fir&s;t overtures of accommodation, he might amu&s;e the Emperor, and tempt him to &s;lacken the activity with which he was now preparing to defend him&s;elf, readily agreed to an interview with Ferdinand, in the town of Lintz, in Au&s;tria: and having left his
<PB N="194" REF="011837_1013_0F9D88FEAF21AC80">
army to proceed on its march, under the command of the Duke of Mecklenburgh, he repaired thither.</P>
<P>THE King of France punctually fulfilled his engage|ment to his allies. He took the field early with a nu|merous and well appointed army, and marching directly into Lorain, Toul and Verdun opened their gates at his approach. His forces appeared next before Metz, and that city, by a fradulent &s;tratagem of the con&s;table Montmorency, who having obtained permi&s;&s;ion to pa&s;s through it with a &s;mall guard, introduced as many troops as were &s;ufficient to overpower the garri&s;on, was likewi&s;e &s;eized without blood&s;hed. Henry made his en|try into all the&s;e towns with great pomp; he obliged the inhabitants to &s;wear allegiance to him, and annexed the&s;e important conque&s;ts to the French monarchy. He left a &s;trong garri&s;on in Metz, From thence he ad|vanced towards Al&s;ace, in order to attempt new con|que&s;ts, to which the &s;ucce&s;s that had hitherto attended his arms invited him <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Thuan. 349.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE conference at Lintz did not produce any ac|commodation. Maurice, when he con&s;ented to it, &s;eems to have had nothing in view but to amu&s;e the Empe|ror; for he made &s;uch demands both in behalf of his confederates, and their ally the French King, as he knew would not be accepted by a Prince, too haughty to &s;ubmit, at once, to conditions dictated by an ene|my. But, how firmly &s;oever Maurice adhered, during the negociation, to the intere&s;ts of his a&s;&s;ociates, or how &s;teadily &s;oever he kept in view the objects which had in|duced him to take arms, he often profe&s;&s;ed a &s;trong in|clination to terminate the differences with the Emperor in an amicable manner. Encouraged by this appear|ance of a pacific di&s;po&s;ition, Ferdinand propo&s;ed a &s;e|cond interview at Pa&s;&s;au, on the twenty-&s;ixth of May, and that a truce &s;hould commence on that day, and continue to the tenth of June, in order to give them lei&s;ure for adju&s;ting all the points in di&s;pute.</P>
<P>UPON this, Maurice rejoined his army on the ninth of May, which had now advanced to Gundelfingen. He put his troops in motion next morning; and as &s;ix|teen
<PB N="195" REF="011837_1014_0F9D88FF715A9138">
days yet remained for action before the commence|ment of the truce, he re&s;olved, during that period, to venture upon an enterprize, the &s;ucce&s;s of which would be &s;o deci&s;ive, as would render the negociations at Pa&s;|&s;au extremely &s;hort, and intitle him to treat upon his own terms. He fore&s;aw that the pro&s;pect of a ce&s;&s;ation of arms, which was to take place &s;o &s;oon, together with the opinion of his earne&s;tne&s;s to re-e&s;tabli&s;h peace, with which he had artfully amu&s;ed Ferdinand, could not fail of in&s;piring the Emperor with &s;uch fal&s;e hopes, that he would naturally become remi&s;s, and relap&s;e, into &s;ome degree of that &s;ecurity, which had already been &s;o fatal to him. Relying on this conjecture, he marched di|rectly towards In&s;pruck, and advanced with the mo&s;t rapid motion that could be given to &s;o great a body of troops. On the eighteenth he arrived at Fie&s;&s;en, a po&s;t of great con&s;equence, at the entrance into the Tyrole&s;e. There he found a body of eight hundred men, whom the Emperor had a&s;&s;embled, &s;trongly entrenched, in order to oppo&s;e his progre&s;s. He attacked them in|&s;tantly with &s;uch violence and impetuo&s;ity, that they abandoned their lines precipitately, and falling back on a &s;econd body po&s;ted near Ruten, communicated to tho&s;e troops, the panic terror with which they them&s;elves had been &s;eized, &s;o that they likewi&s;e took to flight after a feeble re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>ELATED with this &s;ucce&s;s, which exceeded his mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes, Maurice pa&s;&s;ed on to Ehrenberg, a ca&s;tle &s;ituated on a high and &s;teep precipice, which com|manded the only pa&s;s through the mountains. As this fort had been &s;urrendered to the Prote&s;tants, at the be|ginning of the Smalkaldic war, becau&s;e the garri&s;on was then too weak to defend it, the Emperor, &s;en&s;ible of its importance, had taken care, at this juncture, to throw into it a body of troops &s;ufficient to maintain it again&s;t the greate&s;t army. But a &s;hepherd, in pur&s;u|ing a goat which had &s;trayed from his flock, having di&s;covered an unknown path, by which it was po&s;|&s;ible to a&s;cend to the top of the rock, came with his &s;ea|&s;onable piece of intelligence to Maurice. A &s;mall band of cho&s;en &s;oldiers, under the command of George of Mecklenburgh, was in&s;tantly ordered to follow this
<PB N="196" REF="011837_1015_0F9D89002FC01348">
guide. They &s;et out in the evening, and clambering up the rugged track with infinite fatigue, as well as danger, they reached the &s;ummit unperceived; and at an hour which had been concerted, when Maurice be|gan the a&s;&s;ault on the one &s;ide of the ca&s;tle, they ap|peared on the other, ready to &s;cale the walls, which were feeble in that place, becau&s;e it had been hitherto deem|ed inacce&s;&s;ible. The garri&s;on, &s;truck with terror at the &s;ight of an enemy on a quarter where they had thought them&s;elves perfectly &s;ecure, immediately threw down their arms. Maurice, almo&s;t without blood&s;hed, and, which was of greater con&s;equence to him, without lo&s;s of time, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a place, the reduction of which might have retarded him long, and have required the utmo&s;t efforts of his valour and &s;kill <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Arnoldi vita Maurit. 123.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MAURICE was now only two days march from In|&s;pruck, and without lo&s;ing a moment he ordered his infantry to advance thither, having left his cavalry, which was un&s;erviceable in that mountainous country, at Fie&s;|&s;en, to guard the mouth of the pa&s;s. He propo&s;ed to advance with &s;uch rapidity as to anticipate any accounts of the lo&s;s of Ehrenberg, and to &s;urprize the Empe|ror, together with his attendants, in an open town, in|capable of defence. But ju&s;t as his troops began to move, a battallion of mercenaries mutinied, declaring that they would not &s;tir until they had received the gra|tuity, which, according to the cu&s;tom of that age, they claimed as the recompence due to them for having taken a place by a&s;&s;ault. It was with great difficulty, as well as danger, and not without &s;ome con&s;iderable lo&s;s of time, that Maurice quieted this in&s;urrection, and prevailed on the &s;oldiers to follow him to a place where he promi&s;ed them &s;uch rich booty as would be an am|ple reward for all their &s;ervices.</P>
<P>TO the delay occa&s;ioned by this unfore&s;een accident, the Emperor owed his &s;afety. He was informed of the approaching danger, late in the evening, and knowing that nothing could &s;ave him but a &s;peedy flight, he in|&s;tantly left In&s;pruck, without regarding the darkne&s;s of the night, or the violence of the rain which happened to
<PB N="197" REF="011837_1016_0F9D89020EF2F338">
fall at that time; and, notwith&s;tanding his being &s;o much debilitated by the gout, that he could bear no motion but that of a litter, he travelled by the light of torches, taking his way over the Alps, by roads almo&s;t impa&s;&s;ible. His courtiers and attendants followed him with equal precipitation, &s;ome of them on &s;uch hor&s;es as they could ha&s;tily procure, many of them on foot, and all in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion. In this mi&s;erable plight, very unlike the pomp with which Charles had appeared during the five preceding years, as the conqueror of Germany, he arrived at length with his dejected train at Villach, in Carinthia, and &s;carce thought him&s;elf &s;e|cure even in that remote inacce&s;&s;ible corner.</P>
<P>MAURICE entered In&s;pruck a few hours after the Em|peror and his attendants had left it; and, enraged that the prey &s;hould e&s;cape out of his hands when he was ju&s;t ready to &s;eize it, he pur&s;ued them &s;ome miles; but find|ing it impo&s;&s;ible to overtake per&s;ons, to whom their fear gave &s;peed, he returned to the town, and abandon|ed all the Emperor's baggage, and that of his mini&s;ters to be plundered by the &s;oldiers; while he pre&s;erved untouched every thing belonging to the King or the Ro|mans, either becau&s;e he had formed &s;ome friendly con|nection with that Prince, or becau&s;e he wi&s;hed to have it believed that &s;uch a connection &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them. As there now remained only three days to the commencement of the truce, (with &s;uch nicety had Mau|rice calculated his operations) he &s;et out for Pa&s;&s;au, that he might meet Ferdinand on the day appointed.</P>
<P>BEFORE Charles left In&s;pruck, he withdrew the guards placed on the degraded Elector of Saxony, whom, dur|ing five years, he had carried about with him as a pri|&s;oner; and &s;et him entirely at liberty, either with an in|tention to embara&s;s Maurice by letting loo&s;e a rival, who might di&s;pute his title to his dominions and digni|ty, or from a &s;en&s;e of the indecency of detaining him a pri&s;oner, while he him&s;elf run the ri&s;que of being de|prived of his own liberty. But that Prince, &s;eeing no way of e&s;caping, but that which the Emperor took, and abhorring the thoughts of falling into the hands of a kin&s;man, whom he ju&s;tly con&s;idered as the author of all his misfortunes, cho&s;e rather to accompany Charles in
<PB N="198" REF="011837_1017_0F9D8902761ABD10">
his flight, and to expect the final deci&s;ion of his fate from the treaty which was now approaching.</P>
<P>THIS was not the only effect which Maurice's opera|tions produced. It was no &s;ooner known at Trent that he had taken arms, than a general con&s;ternation had &s;eized the fathers of the council. The German pre|lates immediately returned home, that they might pro|vide for the &s;afety of their territories. The re&s;t were extremely impatient to be gone; and the legate, who had hitherto di&s;appointed all the endeavours of the Im|perial amba&s;&s;adors to procure for the Prote&s;tant divines an audience in the council, laid hold with joy on &s;uch a plau&s;ible pretext for di&s;mi&s;&s;ing an a&s;&s;embly, which he had found it &s;o difficult to govern. In a congregation held on the twenty eighth of April, a decree was i&s;&s;ued for proroguing the council during two years, and ap|pointing it to meet at the expiration of that time, if peace were then re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in Europe <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">F. Paul, 353.</NOTE>. This pro|rogation, however, continued no le&s;s than ten years; and its proceedings, when re-a&s;&s;embled in the year one thou&s;and five hundred and &s;ixty-two, fall not within the period pre&s;cribed to this hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>THE convocation of this a&s;&s;embly had been &s;o pa&s;|&s;ionately de&s;ired by all the &s;tates and Princes in Chri&s;ten|dom, who, from the wi&s;dom and piety of prelates re|pre&s;enting the whole body of the faithful, expected &s;ome charitable and efficacious endeavours towards compo&s;ing the di&s;&s;en&s;ions which unhappily had ari&s;en in the church. But the &s;everal Popes, by who&s;e authority it was called, had other objects in view; and, exerting all their power or policy to attain the&s;e, acquired, by the abilities as well as addre&s;s of their legates, by the igno|rance of many of the prelates, and by the &s;ervility of the indigent Italian bi&s;hops, &s;uch influence in the council, that they dictated all its decrees, and framed them, not with an intention to re&s;tore unity and concord to the church, but to e&s;tabli&s;h their own dominion, or to con|firm the&s;e tenets, upon which they imagined that do|minion to be founded. Doctrines, which had hitherto been admitted upon the credit of tradition alone, and
<PB N="199" REF="011837_1018_0F9D8903331F5B48">
received with &s;ome latitude of interpretation, were de|fined with a &s;crupulous nicety, and confirmed by the &s;anction of authority. Rites, which had formerly been ob&s;erved only in deference to cu&s;tom, &s;uppo&s;ed to be antient, were e&s;tabli&s;hed by the decrees of the church, and declared to be e&s;&s;ential parts of its wor&s;hip. The breach, in&s;tead of being clo&s;ed, was widened, and made irreparable. In place of any attempt to reconcile the contending parties, a line was drawn with &s;uch &s;tudied accuracy, as a&s;certained and marked out the di&s;tinction between them. This &s;till &s;erves to keep them at a di&s;|tance; and mu&s;t, without &s;ome &s;ignal interpo&s;ition of Divine Providence, render the &s;eparation perpetual.</P>
<P>OUR knowledge of the proceedings of this a&s;&s;embly is derived from three different authors. Father Paul of Venice wrote his hi&s;tory of the council of Trent, while the memory of what had pa&s;&s;ed there was recent, and &s;ome, who had been members of it, were &s;till alive. He has expo&s;ed the intrigues and artifices by which it was conducted, with a freedom and &s;everity which have given a deep wound to the credit and reputation of the council. He has de&s;cribed its deliberations, and ex|plained its decrees, with &s;uch per&s;picuity and depth of thought, with &s;uch various erudition, and &s;uch force of rea&s;on, as have ju&s;tly intitled his work to be placed among the mo&s;t admired hi&s;torical compo&s;itions. About half a century thereafter, the Je&s;uit Pallavicini publi&s;hed his hi&s;tory of the council, in oppo&s;ition to that of Fa|ther Paul, and by employing all the force of an acute and refining genius to invalidate the credit, or to con|fute the rea&s;onings of his antagoni&s;t, he labours to prove, by artful apologies for the proceedings of the council, and &s;ubtile interpretations of its decrees, that it delibe|rated with impartiality, and decided with judgment as well as candour. Vargas, a Spani&s;h doctor of laws, who was appointed to attend the Imperial amba&s;&s;adors at Trent, &s;ent the bi&s;hop of Arras a regular account of the tran&s;actions there, explaining all the arts which the le|gate employed to influence, or over-awe the council. His letters have been publi&s;hed, in which he inveighs again&s;t the papal court with that a&s;perity of cen&s;ure, which was natural to a man who&s;e &s;ituation enabled him

<P>WHILE Maurice was employed in negociating with the King of the Romans at Lintz, or in making war on the Emperor in the Tyrol, the French King had ad|vanced into Al&s;ace as far as Stra&s;burgh; and having de|manded leave of the &s;enate to march through the city, he hoped that by repeating the &s;ame fraud which he had practi&s;ed at Metz, he might render him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the place, and by that means &s;ecure a pa&s;&s;age over the Rhine, into the heart of Germany. But the Stra&s;burghers, in&s;tructed and put on their guard by the credulity and misfortune of their neighbours, &s;hut their gates; and having a&s;&s;embled a garri&s;on of five thou&s;and &s;ol|diers, prepared their fortifications, razed the hou&s;es in their &s;uburbs, and determined to defend them&s;elves to the utmo&s;t. At the &s;ame time they &s;ent a deputation of their mo&s;t re&s;pectable citizens to the King, in order to divert him from making any ho&s;tile attempt upon them. The Electors of Treves and Cologne, the Duke of Cleves, and other Princes in the neighbourhood, interpo&s;ed in their behalf; be&s;eeching Henry that he would not for|get &s;o &s;oon the title which he had generou&s;ly a&s;&s;umed; and, in&s;tead of being the deliverer of Germany, become its oppre&s;&s;or. The Swi&s;s cantons &s;econded them with zeal, &s;oliciting Henry to &s;pare a city which had long been connected with their community in friend&s;hip and alliance.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="011837_1020_0F9D8904B0CF3958">POWERFUL as this united interce&s;&s;ion was, it would not have prevailed on Henry to forego a prize of &s;o much value, if he had been in a condition to have &s;eized it. But, in that age, the method of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting nume|rous armies at a di&s;tance from the frontiers of their own country, was imperfectly under&s;tood, and neither the revenues of Princes, nor their experience in the art of war, were equal to the great and complicated efforts which &s;uch an undertaking required. The French, though not far removed from their own country, began already to &s;uffer for want of provi&s;ions, and had no &s;uf|ficient magazines collected to &s;upport them during a &s;iege, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have been of great length <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Thuan. 351, 352.</NOTE>. At the &s;ame time, the Queen of Hungary, governe&s;s of the Low-Countries, had a&s;&s;embled a con&s;iderable body of troops, which, under the command of Martin de Ro&s;&s;em, laid wa&s;te Champagne, and threatened the ad|jacent provinces of France. The&s;e concurring circum|&s;tances obliged the King, though with reluctance, to abandon the enterprize. But being willing to acquire &s;ome merit with his allies, by this retreat, which he could not avoid, he pretended to the Swi&s;s that he had taken the re&s;olution merely in compliance with their reque&s;t <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Slied. 557.

<P>WHILE the French King and the main army of the confederates were thus employed; Albert of Branden|burgh was entru&s;ted with the command of a &s;eparate body of eight thou&s;and men, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of mer|cenaries who had re&s;orted to his &s;tandard, rather from the hope of plunder, than the expectation of regular pay. That Prince, &s;eeing him&s;elf at the head of &s;uch a num|ber of de&s;perate adventurers, ready to follow wherever he &s;hould lead them, &s;oon began to di&s;dain a &s;tate of &s;ubordination, and to form &s;uch va&s;t &s;chemes of aggran|dizing him&s;elf, as &s;eldom occur, even to ambitious minds, unle&s;s when civil war, or violent factions, rouze them to bold exertions, by alluring them with immediate hopes of

&s;ucce&s;s. Full of the&s;e a&s;piring thoughts, Albert made war in a manner very different from the other confede|rates. He endeavoured to &s;pread the terror of his arms by the rapidity of his motions, as well as the extent and rigour of his deva&s;tations; he exacted contributions wherever he came, in order to ama&s;s &s;uch a &s;um of mo|ney, as would put it in his power to keep his army to|gether; he laboured to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Nuremberg, Ulme, or &s;ome other of the free cities in Upper Ger|many, in which, as a capital, he might fix the &s;eat of his power. But, finding the&s;e cities on their guard, and in a condition to re&s;i&s;t his attacks, he turned all his rage again&s;t the Popi&s;h eccle&s;ia&s;tics, who&s;e territories he plundered with &s;uch wanton and mercile&s;s barbarity, as gave them a very unfavourable impre&s;&s;ion of the &s;pi|rit of that reformation in religion, with zeal for which he pretended to be animated. The bi&s;hops of Bamberg and Wurzburgh, by their &s;ituation, lay particularly ex|po&s;ed to his ravages; he obliged the former to transfer to him, in property, almo&s;t one half of his exten&s;ive dio|ce&s;e, and compelled the latter to advance an immen&s;e &s;um, in order to &s;ave his country from ruin and de&s;ola|tion. During all the&s;e wild &s;allies, Albert paid no re|gard either to Maurice's orders, who&s;e commands, as Generali&s;&s;imo of the league, he had engaged to obey, or to the remon&s;trances of the other confederates; and manife&s;tly di&s;covered that he attended only to his own private emolument, without any &s;olicitude about the common cau&s;e, or the general objects which had in|duced them to take arms <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 561.

<P>MEANWHILE, Maurice having ordered his army to march back into Bavaria, and having publi&s;hed a pro|clamation enjoining the Lutheran clergy and in&s;truc|tors of youth, to re&s;ume the exerci&s;e of their functions in all the cities, &s;chools, and univer&s;ities, from which they had been ejected, met Ferdinand at Pa&s;&s;au on the twenty-&s;ixth day of May. As matters of the greate&s;t con&s;equence to the future peace and independence of the empire were to be &s;ettled in this congre&s;s, the eyes of all Germany were fixed upon it. Be&s;ides Ferdinand

and the Imperial amba&s;&s;adors, the Duke of Bavaria, the bi&s;hops of Saltzburgh, and Aich&s;tadt, the mini&s;ters of all the Electors, together with deputies from mo&s;t of the con&s;iderable Princes and free cities, re&s;orted to Pa&s;|&s;au. Maurice, in name of his a&s;&s;ociates, and the King of the Romans, as the Emperor's repre&s;entative, opened the negociation. The Princes who were pre&s;ent, toge|ther with the deputies of &s;uch as were ab&s;ent, acted as interce&s;&s;ors or mediators between them.</P>
<P>MAURICE, in a long di&s;cour&s;e, explained the motives of his own conduct. After having enumerated all the uncon&s;titutional and oppre&s;&s;ive acts of the Emperor's ad|mini&s;tration, he, agreeably to the manife&s;to, which he had publi&s;hed when he took arms again&s;t him, limited his demands to three articles. That the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e &s;hould be immediately &s;et at liberty; That the grievances in the civil government of the empire &s;hould be redre&s;&s;ed; and that the Prote&s;tants &s;hould be allow|ed the public exerci&s;e of their religion without mole&s;ta|tion. Ferdinand and the Imperial amba&s;&s;adors di&s;cover|ing their unwillingne&s;s to gratify him with regard to all all the&s;e points, the mediators wrote a joint letter to the Emperor, be&s;eeching him to deliver Germany from the calamities of a civil war, by giving &s;uch &s;atisfaction to Maurice, and his party, as might induce them to lay down their arms; and at the &s;ame time they prevailed upon Maurice to grant a prolongation of the truce for a &s;hort time, during which they undertook to procure the Emperor's final an&s;wer to his demands.</P>
<P>THIS reque&s;t was pre&s;ented to the Emperor in the name of all the Princes of the empire, Popi&s;h as well as Prote&s;tant, in the name of &s;uch as had lent a hand to forward his ambitious &s;chemes, as well as of tho&s;e who had viewed the progre&s;s of his power with jealou&s;y and dread. The uncommon and cordial unanimity with which they concurred at this juncture, in enforcing Maurice's de|mands, and in recommending peace, flowed from dif|ferent cau&s;es. Such as were mo&s;t attached to the Ro|man Catholic church could not help ob&s;erving that the Prote&s;tant confederates were at the head of a numerous army, while the Emperor was but ju&s;t beginning to pro|vide for his own defence. They fore&s;aw that great ef|forts
<PB N="204" REF="011837_1023_0F9D8906F37687B0">
would be required of them, and would be nece&s;|&s;ary on their part, in order to cope with enemies who had been allowed to get the &s;tart &s;o far, and to at|tain &s;uch formidable power. Experience had taught them, that the fruit of all the&s;e efforts would be reaped by the Emperor alone, and the more complete any victo|ry proved which they &s;hould gain, the fa&s;ter would they bind their own fetters, and render them the more into|lerable. The&s;e con&s;iderations made them cautious how they contributed a &s;econd time, by their indi&s;creet zeal, to put the Emperor in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of power which would be fatal to the liberties of their country. Notwith&s;tand|ing the implacable fiercene&s;s of the &s;pirit of bigotry in that age, they cho&s;e rather that the Prote&s;tants &s;hould ac|quire that &s;ecurity for their religion which they demand|ed, than, by a&s;&s;i&s;ting Charles to oppre&s;s them, to give &s;uch additional force to the Imperial prerogative, as would overturn the con&s;titution of the empire. To all the&s;e con&s;iderations, the dread of &s;eeing Germany laid wa&s;te by a civil war added new force. Many &s;tates of the empire already felt the de&s;tructive rage of Albert's arms, others dreaded it, and all wi&s;hed for an accom|modation between the Emperor and Maurice, which they hoped would &s;ave them from that cruel &s;courge.</P>
<P>SUCH were the rea&s;ons that induced &s;o many Princes, notwith&s;tanding the variety of their political intere&s;ts, and the oppo&s;ition in their religious &s;entiments, to unite in recommending to the Emperor an accommodation with Maurice, not only as a &s;alutary, but as a nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ure. The motives which prompted Charles to de|&s;ire it were not fewer or of le&s;s weight. He was per|fectly &s;en&s;ible of the advantage which the confederates had acquired through his own negligence; and he now felt the in&s;ufficiency of his own re&s;ources to oppo&s;e them. His Spani&s;h &s;ubjects, di&s;gu&s;ted at his long ab|&s;ence, and weary of endle&s;s wars, which were of no be|nefit to their country, refu&s;ed to furni&s;h him any con|&s;iderable &s;upply either of men or money; and although he might hope by his addre&s;s, or importunity, to draw from them at la&s;t more effectual aid; that, he knew, was too di&s;tant to be of any &s;ervice in the pre&s;ent exigen|cy of his affairs. His trea&s;ury was drained; his veteran

forces were di&s;per&s;ed, or di&s;banded, and he could not depend much either on the fidelity or courage of the new levied &s;oldiers whom he was collecting. There was no hope of repeating with &s;ucce&s;s the &s;ame artifices which had weakened and ruined the Smalkaldic league. As the end at which he aimed was now known, he could no longer employ the &s;pecious pretexts, which had for|merly concealed his ambitious de&s;igns. Every Prince in Germany was alarmed and on his guard; and it was vain to think of blinding them a &s;econd time to &s;uch a degree, as to make one part of them in&s;truments to en|&s;lave the other. The &s;pirit of a confederacy, whereof Maurice was the head, experience had taught him to be very different from that of the league of Smalkalde; and from what he had already felt, he had no rea&s;on to flatter him&s;elf that its coun&s;els would be as irre&s;olute, or its efforts as timid and feeble. If he &s;hould re&s;olve on continuing the war, he might lay his account that the mo&s;t con&s;iderable &s;tates in Germany would take part in it again&s;t him; and a dubious neutrality was the utmo&s;t he could expect from the re&s;t. While the confederates found full employment for his arms in one quarter, the King of France would &s;eize the favourable opportunity, and pu&s;h on his operations in another, with almo&s;t cer|tain &s;ucce&s;s. That Monarch had already made conque&s;ts in the empire, which he was no le&s;s eager to recover, than impatient to be revenged on him for aiding his malecontent &s;ubjects. Though Henry had now retired from the banks of the Rhine, he had only varied the &s;cene of ho&s;tilities, having invaded the Low-Countries with all his forces. The Turks, rouzed by the &s;olicita|tions of the French King, as well as &s;timulated by re&s;ent|ment again&s;t Ferdinand, for having violated the truce in Hungary, had prepared a powerful fleet to ravage the coa&s;ts of Naples and Sicily, which he had left almo&s;t de|fencele&s;s, by calling thence the greate&s;t part of the regu|lar troops, to join the army which he was now a&s;&s;em|bling.</P>
<P>FERDINAND, who went in per&s;on to Villach, in order to lay before the Emperor the re&s;ult of the conferences at Pa&s;&s;au, had likewi&s;e rea&s;ons peculiar to him&s;elf for de|&s;iring an accommodation. The&s;e prompted him to &s;e|cond,
<PB N="206" REF="011837_1025_0F9D89086F7C6328">
with the greate&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s, the arguments which the Princes, a&s;&s;embled there, had employed in recom|mending it. He had ob&s;erved, not without &s;ecret &s;a|tisfaction, the fatal blow which had been given to the de&s;potic power, which his brother had u&s;urped in the empire. He was extremely &s;olicitous to prevent Charles from recovering what he had lo&s;t, as he fore&s;aw that he would immediately re&s;ume with fre&s;h eagerne&s;s, and a better chance of &s;ucce&s;s, his favourite &s;cheme of tran&s;|mitting that power to his &s;on, by excluding him from the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the Imperial throne. On this account, he was willing to contribute towards circum|&s;cribing the Imperial authority, in order to render his own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it certain. Be&s;ides, Solyman, exa&s;|perated at the lo&s;s of Tran&s;ylvania, and &s;till more at the fradulent arts by which it had been &s;eized, had ordered into the field an army of an hundred thou&s;and men, which having defeated a great body of Ferdinand's troops, and taken &s;everal places of importance, threat|ened not only to complete the conque&s;t of the province, but to drive him out of that part of Hungary which was &s;till &s;ubject to his juri&s;diction. He was unable to re&s;i&s;t &s;uch a mighty enemy; his brother, while engaged in a dome&s;tic war, could afford him no aid; and he could not even hope to draw from Germany the con|tingent either of troops or money, u&s;ually furni&s;hed to re|pel the inva&s;ions of the Infidels. Maurice, having ob|&s;erved Ferdinand's perplexity, with regard to this la&s;t point, had offered, if peace were re-e&s;tabli&s;hed on a &s;e|cure foundation, that he would march in per&s;on with his troops into Hungary, to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Such was the effect of this well-timed propo&s;al, that Ferdinand, de|&s;titute of every other pro&s;pect of relief, became the mo&s;t zealous advocate the confederates could have cho&s;en to urge their claims, and there was &s;carce any thing that they could have demanded which he would not have cho&s;en to grant, rather than to have retarded a pacifica|tion, to which he tru&s;ted as the only means of &s;aving his Hungarian crown.</P>
<P>WHEN &s;o many cau&s;es con&s;pired in rendering an ac|commodation elegible, it might have been expected that it would have immediately taken place. But the
<PB N="207" REF="011837_1026_0F9D89093090F008">
inflexibility of the Emperor's temper, together with his unwillingne&s;s to relinqui&s;h, at once, objects which he had long pur&s;ued with &s;uch earne&s;tne&s;s and a&s;&s;iduity, coun|terbalanced for &s;ome time, the force of all the motives which di&s;po&s;ed him to peace, and not only put that event at a di&s;tance, but &s;eemed to render it uncertain. When Maurice's demands, together with the letter of the mediators at Pa&s;&s;au, were pre&s;ented to him, he pe|remptorily refu&s;ed to redre&s;s the grievances which were pointed out, nor would he agree to any &s;tipulation for the immediate &s;ecurity of the Prote&s;tant religion, but propo&s;ed referring both the&s;e to the determination of a future Diet. On his part, he required that in&s;tant re|paration &s;hould be made to all who, during the pre&s;ent war, had &s;uffered either by the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the con|federate troops, or the actions of their leaders.</P>
<P>MAURICE, who was well acquainted with the Em|peror's arts, immediately concluded that he had nothing in view in the&s;e overtures but to amu&s;e and deceive; and therefore, without li&s;tening to Ferdinand's intrea|ties, he left Pa&s;&s;au abruptly, and joining his troops, which were encamped at Mergentheim, a city in Fran|conia, belonging to the knights of the Teutonic order, he put them in motion, and renewed ho&s;tilities. As three thou&s;and men in the Emperor's pay had thrown them&s;elves into Franckfort on the Maine, and might from thence infe&s;t the neighbouring country of He&s;&s;e, he marched towards that city, and laid &s;iege to it in form. The bri&s;kne&s;s of this enterprize, and the vigour with which Maurice carried on his approaches again&s;t the town, gave &s;uch an alarm to the Emperor, as di&s;|po&s;ed him to lend a more favourable ear to Ferdinand's arguments in behalf of an accommodation. Firm and haughty as his nature was, he found it nece&s;&s;ary to bend, and &s;ignified his willingne&s;s to make conce&s;&s;ions on his part, if Maurice, in return, would abate &s;ome|what of the rigour of his demands. Ferdinand, as &s;oon as he perceived that he began to yield, did not de&s;i&s;t from his importunities, until he prevailed on him to de|clare what was the utmo&s;t that he would grant for the &s;ecurity of the confederates. Having gained this diffi|cult point, he in&s;tantly di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger to Mau|rice's

camp, and importing to him the Emperor's final re&s;olution, and conjured him not to fru&s;trate his endea|vours for the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of peace; or, by an un|&s;ea&s;onable ob&s;tinacy on his &s;ide, to di&s;appoint the wi&s;hes of all Germany for that &s;alutary event.</P>
<P>MAURICE, notwith&s;tanding the pro&s;perous &s;ituation of his affairs, was &s;trongly inclined to li&s;ten to his ad|vice. The Emperor, though over-reached and &s;urpriz|ed, had now begun to a&s;&s;emble troops, and how &s;low &s;oever his motions might be, while the fir&s;t effects of his con&s;ternation remained, he was &s;en&s;ible that Charles mu&s;t at la&s;t act with vigour proportional to the extent of his power and territories, and lead into Germany an army formidable by its numbers, and &s;till more by the terror of his name, as well as the remembrance of his pa&s;t victories. He could &s;carce hope that a confedera|cy, compo&s;ed of &s;o many members, would continue to operate with &s;ufficient union and per&s;everance to re&s;i&s;t the con&s;i&s;tent and well directed efforts of an army, at the ab&s;olute di&s;po&s;al of a leader accu&s;tomed to com|mand and to conquer. He felt already, although he had not hitherto experienced the &s;hock of any adver&s;e event, that he was the head of a disjointed body. He &s;aw from the example of Albert of Brandenburgh, how difficult it would be, with all his addre&s;s and credit, to prevent any particular member from detaching him&s;elf from the whole, and how impo&s;&s;ible to recal him to his proper rank and &s;ubordination. This filled him with ap|prehen&s;ions for the common cau&s;e. Another con&s;ide|ration gave him no le&s;s di&s;quiet with regard to his own particular intere&s;ts. By &s;etting at liberty the degraded Elector, and by repealing the act depriving him of his hereditary honours and dominions, the Emperor had it in his power to wound him in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible part. The efforts of a Prince beloved by his antient &s;ubjects, and revered by all the Prote&s;tant party, in order to re|cover what had been unju&s;tly taken from him, could &s;carce have failed of exciting commotions in Saxony, which would endanger all that he had acquired at the expence of &s;o much di&s;&s;imulation and artifice. It was no le&s;s in the Emperor's power to render vain all the &s;o|licitations of the confederates in behalf of the Landgrave.
<PB N="209" REF="011837_1028_0F9D890AAFEA1148">
He had only to add one act of violence more to the in|ju&s;tice and rigour with which he had already treated him; and he had accordingly threatened the &s;ons of that unfortunate Prince, that if they per&s;i&s;ted in their pre&s;ent enterprize, in&s;tead of &s;eeing their father re&s;tored to liberty, they &s;hould hear of his having &s;uffered the puni&s;hment which his rebellion had merited <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 571.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>SUCH was the memorable treaty of Pa&s;&s;au, that over|turned the va&s;t fabric, in erecting which Charles had employed &s;o many years, and had exerted the utmo&s;t of his power and policy; which annulled all his regula|tions with regard to religion; defeated all his hopes of rendering the Imperial authority ab&s;olute and hereditary in his family; and e&s;tabli&s;hed the Prote&s;tant church, which had hitherto &s;ub&s;i&s;ted precariou&s;ly in Germany, through connivance, or by expedients, upon a firm and &s;ecure ba&s;is. Maurice reaped all the glory of having concerted and completed this unexpected revolution. It is a &s;ingular circum&s;tance, that the Reformation &s;hould be indebted for its &s;ecurity and full e&s;tabli&s;hment in Germany, to the &s;ame hand which had formerly brought it to the brink of de&s;truction, and that both events &s;hould have been accompli&s;hed by the &s;ame arts of di&s;|&s;imulation. The ends, however, which Maurice had in view, at the&s;e different junctures, &s;eem to have been more attended to than the means by which he attain|ed them; and he was now as univer&s;ally extolled for his zeal and public &s;pirit, as he had lately been con|demned for his indifference and intere&s;ted policy. It is no le&s;s worthy of ob&s;ervation, that the French King, a Monarch zealous for the Catholic faith, &s;hould, at the very time he was per&s;ecuting his own Prote&s;tant &s;ubjects with all the fiercene&s;s of bigotry, employ his power in order to protect and maintain the Reformation in the empire; and that the league for this purpo&s;e, which proved &s;o fatal to the Romi&s;h church, &s;hould be nego|ciated and &s;igned by a Roman Catholic bi&s;hop. So won|derfully doth the wi&s;dom of God &s;uperintend and regu|late the caprice of human pa&s;&s;ions, and render them &s;ub&s;ervient towards the accompli&s;hment of his own pur|po&s;es!</P>

and his a&s;&s;ociates, having gained what they had in view, di&s;covered no great &s;olicitude about an ally, whom, perhaps, they reckoned to be over-paid, by his acqui&s;i|tions in Lorain, for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance which he had given them. A &s;hort clau&s;e, which they procured to be in|&s;erted in the treaty, importing, that the King of France might communicate to the&s;e confederates his particular preten&s;ions or cau&s;es of ho&s;tility, which they would lay before the Emperor, was the only &s;ign that they gave of their remembering how much they had been indebted to him for their &s;ucce&s;s. Henry experienced the &s;ame treatment, which every prince who lends his aid to the authors of a civil war may expect. As &s;oon as the rage of faction began to &s;ub&s;ide, and any pro&s;pect of accom|modation began to open, his &s;ervices were forgotten, and his a&s;&s;ociates made a merit with their Sovereign, of the ingratitude with which they abandoned their protec|tor. But how much &s;oever Henry might be enraged at the perfidy of his allies, or at the impatience with which they ha&s;tened to make their peace with the Emperor at his expence, he was perfectly &s;en&s;ible that it was more his intere&s;t to keep well with the Germanic body, than to re&s;ent the indignities offered him by any particular members of it. For that rea&s;on he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the ho&s;|tages which he had received from Maurice and his a&s;|&s;ociates, and affected to talk in the &s;ame &s;train, as for|merly, concerning his zeal for maintaining the antient con&s;titution and liberties of the empire.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE REIGN OF THE EMPEROR CHARLES V. BOOK XI.</HEAD>
<P>AS &s;oon as the treaty of Pa&s;&s;au was &s;igned, Mau|rice, in con&s;equence of his engagements with Ferdinand, marched into Hungary at the head of twenty thou&s;and men. But the va&s;t &s;uperiority of the Turki&s;h armies, the frequent mutinies, both of the Spani&s;h and German &s;oldiers, occa&s;ioned by their want of pay, together with the di&s;&s;entions between Mau|rice and Ca&s;taldo, who was piqued at being obliged to re&s;ign the chief command to him, prevented his performing any thing in that country worthy of his former fame, or of great benefit to the King of the Romans <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;luanhaffi Hi&s;t.

<P>WHEN Maurice &s;et out for Hungary, the Prince of He&s;&s;e parted from him with the forces under his com|mand, and marched back into his own country, that he might be ready to receive his father upon his re|turn, and give up to him the reins of government which he had held during his ab&s;ence. But fortune was not yet weary of per&s;ecuting the Landgrave. A battalion of mercenary troops, which had been in the pay of He&s;&s;e, being &s;educed by Reifenberg their colo|nel,
<PB N="194" REF="011837_1032_0F9D890DB0624E88">
a &s;oldier of fortune, and ready to engage in any enterprize, &s;ecretly withdrew from the young Prince as he was marching homewards, and joined Albert of Brandenburgh, who &s;till continued in arms again&s;t the Emperor, refu&s;ing to be included in the treaty of Pa&s;&s;au. Unhappily for the Landgrave, an account of this reached the Netherlands, ju&s;t as he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the citadel of Mechlin where he had been con|fined, but before he had got beyond the frontiers of that country. The Queen of Hungary, who govern|ed there in her brother's name, incen&s;ed at &s;uch an open violation of the treaty to which he owed his li|berty, commanded him to be arre&s;ted, and commit|ted him again to the cu&s;tody of the &s;ame Spani&s;h cap|tain who had guarded him for five years with &s;uch &s;e|vere vigilence. Philip beheld all the horrors of his impri&s;onment renewed, and his &s;pirits &s;ub&s;iding in the &s;ame proportion as they had ri&s;en during the &s;hort interval in which he had enjoyed liberty, he &s;unk in|to de&s;pair, and believed him&s;elf to be doomed to per|petual captivity. But the matter being explained to the Emperor's full &s;atisfaction, that the revolt of Rei|fenberg's mercenaries could be imputed neither to the Landgrave nor to his &s;on, he gave orders for his re|lea&s;e; and Philip at la&s;t obtained the liberty for which he &s;o long langui&s;hed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 573.

But though he recovered his freedom, and was rein&s;tated in his dominions, his &s;ufferings &s;eem to have broken the vigour, and to have extingui&s;hed the activity of his mind: From be|ing the bolde&s;t as well as mo&s;t enterprizing Prince in the Empire, he became the mo&s;t timid and cautious, and pa&s;&s;ed the remainder of his days in a pacific indo|lence.</P>
<P>THE degraded Elector of Saxony likewi&s;e procured his liberty in con&s;equence of the treaty of Pa&s;&s;au. The Emperor having been obliged to relinqui&s;h all his &s;chemes for extirpating the Prote&s;tant religion, had no longer any motive for detaining him a pri&s;oner; and being extremely &s;ollicitous, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that juncture, to recover the confidence and good will of the Germans, who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance was e&s;&s;ential to the &s;ucce&s;s of the en|terprize

which he meditated again&s;t the King of France, he, among other expedients for that purpo&s;e, thought of relea&s;ing from impri&s;onment a Prince who&s;e merit entitled him no le&s;s to e&s;teem, than his &s;ufferings ren|dered him the object of compa&s;&s;ion. John Frederick took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion accordingly of that part of his territo|ries which had been re&s;erved for him, when Maurice was inve&s;ted with the Electoral dignity. As he con|tinued to di&s;play in this &s;ituation, the &s;ame virtuous magnanimity, for which he had been con&s;picuous in a more pro&s;perous and &s;plendid &s;tate, and which he had retained amid&s;t all his &s;ufferings, he lived &s;everal years in that high reputation to which he had &s;o ju&s;t a title.</P>
<P>THE lo&s;s of Metz, Toul and Verdun, had made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on the Emperor. Accu&s;tomed to ter|minate all his operations again&s;t France with advan|tage to him&s;elf, he thought that it nearly concerned his honour not to allow Henry the &s;uperiority in this war, or to &s;uffer his own admini&s;tration to be &s;tained with the infamy of having permitted territories of &s;uch con&s;equence to be di&s;membered from the Em|pire. This was no le&s;s a point of intere&s;t than of ho|nour. As the frontier of Champagne was more nak|ed, and lay more expo&s;ed than that of any province in France, he had frequently, during his wars with that kingdom, made inroads upon it with great &s;uc|ce&s;s and effect; but if Henry were allowed to retain his late conque&s;ts, France would gain &s;uch a formida|ble barrier on that &s;ide, as to be altogether &s;ecure, where formerly &s;he had been the weake&s;t. On the other hand, the Emperor had now lo&s;t as much, in point of &s;ecurity, as France had acquired, and being &s;trip|ped of the defence which tho&s;e cities afforded it, lay open to be invaded on a quarter, where all the towns having been hitherto con&s;idered as interior, and re|mote from any enemy, were but &s;lightly fortified. The&s;e con&s;iderations determined Charles to attempt recovering the three towns of which Henry had made him&s;elf ma&s;ter; and the preparations which he made again&s;t Maurice and his a&s;&s;ociates enabled him to carry his re&s;olution into immediate execution.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="011837_1034_0F9D890F3391E398">AS &s;oon, then, as the peace was concluded at Pa&s;|&s;au, he left his inglorious retreat at Villach, and ad|vanced to Aug&s;burg at the head of a con&s;iderable bo|dy of Germans which he had levied, together with all the troops which he had drawn out of Italy and Spain. To the&s;e he added &s;everal battalions, which having been in the pay of the Confederates, entered into his &s;ervice when di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by them; and he prevailed likewi&s;e on &s;ome of the Princes of the Empire to join him with their va&s;&s;als. In order to conceal the de&s;ti|nation of this formidable army, and to guard again&s;t alarming the French &s;o as to put them on preparing for their defence, he gave out that he was to march forthwith into Hungary, in order to &s;econd Maurice in his operations again&s;t the Infidels. When he began to advance towards the Rhine, and could no longer employ that pretext, he tried a new artifice, and &s;pread a report that he was marching in order to cha&s;ti&s;e Albert of Brandenburg, who&s;e cruel exactions in that part of the Empire called loudly for his interpo&s;ition to check them.</P>
<P>BUT the French having grown acquainted, at la&s;t, with arts by which they had been &s;o often deceived, viewed all Charles's motions with di&s;tru&s;t. Henry immediately gue&s;&s;ed the true object of his va&s;t prepa|rations, and re&s;olved to defend the important con|que&s;ts which he had gained with vigour equal to that with which they were about to be attacked. As he fore&s;aw that he whole weight of the war would be turned again&s;t Metz, the fate of which would decide that of Toul and Verdun, he nominated Francis of Lorrain Duke of Gui&s;e to take the command in that city during the &s;iege, the i&s;&s;ue of which would equal|ly affect the honour and intere&s;t of his country. His choice could not have fallen upon any per&s;on more worthy of that tru&s;t. The Duke of Gui&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in a high degree, all the qualities of courage, &s;agacity and pre&s;ence of mind, which render men eminent in military command. He was largely endowed with that magnanimity of &s;oul which delights in bold enter|prizes, and a&s;pires to fame by &s;plendid and extraor|dinary actions. He repaired with joy to the dange|rous
<PB N="197" REF="011837_1035_0F9D89110BEC8938">
&s;tation a&s;&s;igned him, as to a theatre on which he he might di&s;play his great qualities under the imme|diate eye of his countrymen all ready to applaud him. The martial genius of the French nobility in that age, which con&s;idered it as the greate&s;t reproach to re|main inactive, when there was any opportunity of &s;ignalizing their courage, prompted great numbers to follow a leader who was the darling as well as the pattern of all that courted military fame. Several Princes of the blood, many noblemen of the highe&s;t rank, and all the young officers who could obtain the King's permi&s;&s;ion, entered Metz as voluntiers. By their pre&s;ence they added &s;pirit to the garri&s;on, and enabled the Duke of Gui&s;e to employ on every emer|gency per&s;ons eager to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves, and fit to conduct any &s;ervice.</P>
<P>BUT with whatever alacrity the Duke of Gui&s;e un|dertook the defence of Metz, he found every thing, upon his arrival there, in &s;uch a &s;ituation, as might have induced any per&s;on of le&s;s intrepid courage to de&s;pair of defending it with &s;ucce&s;s. The city was of great extent, with large &s;uburbs; the walls were in many places feeble and without ramparts; the ditch narrow; and the old towers, which projected in&s;tead of ba&s;tions, were at too great di&s;tance from each other to defend the &s;pace between them. For all the&s;e de|fects he endeavoured to provide the be&s;t remedy, which the time would permit. He ordered the &s;ub|urbs, without &s;paring the mona&s;teries or churches, not even that of St. Arnulph, in which &s;everal Kings of France had been buried, to be levelled with the ground; but in order to guard again&s;t the imputation of impiety, to which &s;uch a violation of &s;o many &s;a|cred edifices, as well as of the a&s;hes of the dead might expo&s;e him, he executed this with much religious ce|remony. Having ordered all the holy ve&s;tments and uten&s;ils, together with the bones of the Kings, and other per&s;ons depo&s;ited in the&s;e churches to be re|moved, they were carried in &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion to a church within the walls, he him&s;elf walking before them uncovered, with a torch in his hand. He then pulled down &s;uch hou&s;es as &s;tood near the walls,
<PB N="198" REF="011837_1036_0F9D891170D8FD58">
cleared and enlarged the ditch, repaired the ruinous fortifications, and erected new ones. As it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary that all the&s;e works &s;hould be fini&s;hed with the utmo&s;t expedition, he laboured at them with his own hands; the officers and voluntiers imitated his exam|ple, and the &s;oldiers &s;ubmitted with chearfulne&s;s to the mo&s;t &s;evere fatigues, when they &s;aw that their &s;u|periors did not decline to bear a part in the&s;e together with them. At the &s;ame time he compelled all u&s;e|le&s;s per&s;ons to leave the place; he filled the magazines with provi&s;ions and military &s;tores; burnt the mills and de&s;troyed the corn and forage for &s;everal miles round the town. Such were his popular talents, as well as his arts of acquiring an a&s;cendant over the minds of men, that the citizens &s;econded him with no le&s;s ardour than the &s;oldiers; and every other pa&s;&s;ion being &s;wallowed up in the zeal to repul&s;e the enemy, with which he in&s;pired them, they beheld the ruin of their e&s;tates, together, with the havock, which he made among their publick and private buildings, without any emotion of re&s;entment <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thuan. xi. 387.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MEANTIME the Emperor, having collected all his forces, continued his march towards Metz. As he pa&s;&s;ed through the cities on the Rhine, he &s;aw the di&s;mal effects of that licentious and wa&s;teful war which Albert had carried on in the&s;e parts. Upon his approach, that Prince, though at the head of twenty thou&s;and men, withdrew into Lorrain, as if he in|tended to join the French King, who&s;e arms he had quartered with his own in all his &s;tandards and en&s;igns. Albert was not in a condition to cope with the Impe|rial troops, which amounted at lea&s;t to &s;ixty thou&s;and men, forming one of the mo&s;t numerous and be&s;t ap|pointed armies that had been brought into the field, during that age, in any of the wars among the Chri&s;|tian Princes.</P>
<P>THE chief command under the Emperor, was committed to the Duke of Alva, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Mar|quis de Marignano, together with the mo&s;t experi|enced of the Italian and Spani&s;h generals. As it was
<PB N="199" REF="011837_1037_0F9D89122E6503A0">
towards the end of October, the&s;e intelligent officers repre&s;ented the great danger of beginning, at &s;uch an advanced &s;ea&s;on, a &s;iege which could not fail to prove very tedious. But Charles adhered to his own opinion with his u&s;ual ob&s;tinacy, and being confident that he had made &s;uch preparations, and taken &s;uch precautions as would en&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s, he ordered the city to be inve&s;ted. As &s;oon as the duke of Alva ap|peared, a large body of the French &s;allied out and at|tacked his van guard with great vigour, put it in confu&s;ion, and killed or took pri&s;oners a con&s;iderable number of men. By this early &s;pecimen, which they gave of the conduct of their officers, as well as the valour of their troops, they &s;hewed the Imperial|i&s;ts what an enemy they had to encounter, and how dear every advantage mu&s;t co&s;t them. The place, however, was compleatly inve&s;ted, the trenches were opened, and the other works begun.</P>
<P>THE attention both of the be&s;iegers and be&s;ieged was turned for &s;ome time towards Albert of Branden|burgh, and they &s;trove with emulation which &s;hould gain that Prince, who &s;till hovered in the neighbour|hood, fluctuating in all the uncertainty of irre&s;oluti|on, natural to a man, who being &s;wayed by no prin|ciple, was allured different ways by contrary views of intere&s;t. The French tempted him with offers ex|tremely beneficial; the Imperiali&s;ts &s;crupled at no promi&s;e which they thought would make an impre&s;&s;i|on upon him. After much he&s;itation he was gained by the Emperor, from whom he expected to receive advantages, which were both more immediate and more permanent. As the French King, who began to &s;u&s;pect his intentions, had appointed a body of troops under the Duke of Aumale, brother to the Duke Gui&s;e, to watch his motions, Albert fell upon them unexpectedly, with &s;uch vigour, that he routed them entirely, killed many of the officers, wounded Aumale him&s;elf, and took him pri&s;oner. Imme|diately after this victory, he marched in triumph to Metz, and joined his army to that of the Emperor.

Charles, in reward for this &s;ervice, and the great ac|ce&s;&s;ion of &s;trength which he brought him, granted Albert a pardon, in form, of pa&s;t offences, and con|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d him in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the territories which he had violently u&s;urped during the war <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 575.

<P>THE Duke of Gui&s;e, though deeply affected with his brother's misfortune, did not remit, in any de|gree, the vigour with which he defended the town. He harra&s;&s;ed the be&s;iegers by frequent &s;allies, in which his officers were &s;o eager to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves, that his authority, being &s;carce &s;ufficient to re&s;train the impetuo&s;ity of their courage, he was obliged at different times to &s;hut the gates and to conceal the keys, in order to prevent the Princes of the blood, and noblemen of the fir&s;t rank, from expo&s;ing them|&s;elves to danger in every &s;ally. He repaired in the night what the enemy's artillery had beat down during the day, or erected behind the ruined works, new fortifications of almo&s;t equal &s;trength. The Im|periali&s;ts, on their part, pu&s;hed on the attack with great &s;pirit, and carried forward, at once, approach|es again&s;t different parts of the town. But the art of attacking fortified places was not then arrived at that degree of perfection, to which it was carried towards the clo&s;e of the &s;ixteenth century, during the long war in the Netherlands. The be&s;iegers, after the un|wearied labour of many weeks, found that they had made but little progre&s;s; and although their batteries had made breaches in different places, they &s;aw, to their a&s;toni&s;hment, works &s;uddenly appear, in demoli&s;hing which their fatigues and dangers would be renewed. The Emperor, enraged at the ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance which his army met with, left Thionville, where he had been confined by a violent fit of the gout, and though &s;till &s;o infirm that he was obliged to be carried in a litter, he repaired to the camp; that by his pre&s;ence he might animate the &s;oldiers, and urge on the attack with greater &s;pirit. Upon his arriv|al, new batteries were erected, and new efforts made with redoubled ardour.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="011837_1039_0F9D8913B0D720C8">BUT, by this time, the winter had &s;et in with great rigour; the camp was alternately deluged with rain, or covered with &s;now; at the &s;ame time provi&s;ions were become extremely &s;carce, as the body of French cavalry which hovered in the neighbourhood, often interrupted the convoys, or rendered their arrival difficult and uncertain. Di&s;ea&s;es began to &s;pread among the &s;oldiers, e&s;pecially among the Italians and Spaniards, unaccu&s;tomed to &s;uch inclement weather; great numbers were di&s;abled from &s;erving, and many died. At length, &s;uch breaches were made as &s;eemed practicable, and the Emperor re&s;olved to hazard a ge|neral a&s;&s;ault, in &s;pite of all the remon&s;trances of his generals concerning the imprudence of attacking a numerous garri&s;on, conducted and animated by the mo&s;t gallant of the French nobility, with an army weakened by di&s;ea&s;es, and di&s;heartned with ill &s;uc|ce&s;s. The Duke of Gui&s;e, &s;u&s;pecting his intentions, from the extraordinary hurry which he ob&s;erved in the enemy's camp, ordered all his troops to their re|&s;pective po&s;ts. They appeared immediately on the wall, and behind the breaches, with &s;uch a deter|mined countenance, &s;o eager for the combat, and &s;o well prepared to give the a&s;&s;ailants a warm reception, that the Imperiali&s;ts, in&s;tead of advancing to the charge, when the word of command was given, &s;tood motionle&s;s, in a timid dejected &s;ilence. The Emperor, perceiving that he could not tru&s;t troops who&s;e &s;pirits were &s;o much broken, retired abruptly to his quarters, complaining that he was now de&s;erted by his &s;oldiers, who de&s;erved no longer the name of men <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thuan. 397.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DEEPLY as this behaviour of his troops mortified and affected him, Charles would not hear of abandon|ing the &s;iege, though he &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of changing the method of attack. He &s;u&s;pended the fury of his batteries, and propo&s;ed to proceed by the more &s;e|cure but tedious method of &s;apping. But as it &s;till continued to rain or to &s;now almo&s;t ince&s;&s;antly, &s;uch as were employed in this &s;ervice endured incredible

hard&s;hips; and the duke of Gui&s;e, who&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry was not inferior to his valour, di&s;covering a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their mines, counter-worked them, and prevented their effect. At la&s;t, Charles, finding it impo&s;&s;ible to con|tend any longer with the rigour of the &s;ea&s;on, and with enemies, whom he could neither overpower by force, nor &s;ubdue by art, while at the &s;ame time a contagious di&s;temper raged among his troops, and cut off daily great numbers of his officers as well as &s;oldiers, yielded to the &s;ollicitations of his generals, who conjured him to &s;ave the remains of his army by a timely retreat; "Fortune," &s;ays he, "I now per|ceive, re&s;embles other females, and chu&s;es to confer her favours on young men, while &s;he for&s;akes tho&s;e who are advanced in years."</P>
<P>UPON this, he gave orders immediately to rai&s;e the &s;iege, and &s;ubmitted to the di&s;grace of abandoning the enterprize, after having continued fifty-&s;ix days before the town, during which time he had lo&s;t up|wards of thirty thou&s;and men, who died of di&s;ea&s;es, or were killed by the enemy. The Duke of Gui&s;e, as &s;oon as he perceived the intention of the Imperiali&s;ts, took mea&s;ures to prevent their retiring unmole&s;ted, and &s;ent out &s;everal bodies, both of cavalry and in|fantry, to infe&s;t their rear, to pick up &s;tragglers, and to &s;eize every opportunity of attacking them with advantage. Such was the confu&s;ion with which they made their retreat, that the French might have an|noyed them in the mo&s;t cruel manner. But when they &s;allied out, a &s;pectacle pre&s;ented it&s;elf to their view, which extingui&s;hed at once all ho&s;tile rage, and melted them into tenderne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion. The Imperial camp was filled with the &s;ick and wounded, with the dead and the dying. In all the different roads by which the army retired, numbers were found, who having made an effort beyond their &s;trength to e&s;cape, were left, when they could go no farther, to peri&s;h without a&s;&s;i&s;tance.

<P>TO the&s;e calamities in Germany, were added &s;uch unfortunate events in Italy, as rendered this the mo&s;t di&s;a&s;trous year in the Emperor's life. During his re|&s;idence at Villach, Charles had applied to Co&s;mo de Medici, for the loan of two hundred thou&s;and crowns. But his credit, at that time, was &s;o low, that, in or|der to obtain this incon&s;iderable &s;um, he was obliged to put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the principality of Piombi|no, and, by giving up that, he lo&s;t the footing which he had hitherto maintained in Tu&s;cany, and enabled Co&s;mo to a&s;&s;ume, for the future, the tone and deport|ment of a Prince altogether independant. Much about the time that his indigence con&s;trained him to part with this valuable territory, he lo&s;t Siena, which was of &s;till greater con&s;equence, through the ill conduct of Don Diego de Mendoza <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thuan. lib. xi. 376.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SIENA, like mo&s;t of the great cities in Italy, had long enjoyed a republican government, under the protection of the Empire; but being torn in pieces by the di&s;&s;entions between the nobles and the people, which divided all the commonwealths, the faction of the people, which gained the a&s;cendant, be&s;ought the Emperor to become the guardian of the admini|&s;tration which they had e&s;tabli&s;hed, and admitted into

their city a &s;mall body of Spani&s;h &s;oldiers, whom he had &s;ent to countenance the execution of the laws, and to pre&s;erve tranquillity among them. The direction of the&s;e troops was given to Mendoza, at that time amba&s;&s;ador for the Emperor at Rome, who per&s;uaded the credulous multitude, that it was nece&s;&s;ary for their &s;ecurity again&s;t any future attempt of the no|bles, to allow him to build a citadel in Siena; and as he flattered him&s;elf that by means of this fortre&s;s he might render the Emperor ma&s;ter of the city, he pu&s;h|ed on the works with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch. But he threw off the ma&s;k too &s;oon. Before the fortificati|ons were compleated, he began to indulge his natu|ral haughtine&s;s and &s;everity of temper, and to treat the citizens with great in&s;olence. At the &s;ame time the &s;oldiers in garri&s;on being paid as irregularly as the Emperor's troops u&s;ually were, lived almo&s;t at di&s;|cretion upon the inhabitants, and were guilty of ma|ny acts of licence and oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THESE injuries awakened the Siene&s;e to a &s;en&s;e of their danger. As they &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of exerting them&s;elves, while the unfini&s;hed fortifications of the citadel left them any hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, they applied to the French amba&s;&s;ador at Rome, who readily promi&s;|ed them his ma&s;ter's protection and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. At the &s;ame time, forgetting their dome&s;tic animo&s;ities when &s;uch a mortal blow was aimed at the liberty and exi&s;tence of the republick, they &s;ent agents to the ex|iled nobles, and invited them to concur with them in &s;aving their country from the &s;ervitude with which it was threatned. As there was not a moment to lo&s;e, mea&s;ures were concerted &s;peedily, but with great prudence; and were executed with equal vigour. The citizens ro&s;e &s;uddenly in arms; the exiles flocked into the town from different parts with all their par|tizans, and what troops they could draw together; and &s;everal bodies of mercenaries in the pay of France appeared to &s;upport them. The Spaniards, though &s;urprized, and much inferior in number, defended them&s;elves with great courage; but &s;eeing no pro&s;|pect of relief, and having no hopes of maintaining their &s;tation long, in a half-fini&s;hed fortre&s;s, they &s;oon

<P>TO the&s;e misfortunes, one &s;till more fatal had al|mo&s;t &s;ucceeded. The &s;evere admini&s;tration of Don Pedro de Toledo, viceroy of Naples, having filled that kingdom with murmuring and di&s;affection, the Prince of Salerno, the head of the malecontents, had fled to the court of France, where all who bore ill-will to the Emperor or his mini&s;ters, were &s;ure of finding pro|tection and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. That nobleman, in the u&s;ual &s;tile of exiles, boa&s;ting much of his partizans, and of his great influence with them, prevailed on Henry to think of invading Naples, from expectation of being joined by all tho&s;e with whom the Prince of Salerno held corre&s;pondence, or who were di&s;&s;atisfied with Toledo's government. But though the fir&s;t hint of this enterprize was &s;ugge&s;ted by the Prince of Salerno, Henry did not chu&s;e that its &s;ucce&s;s &s;hould entirely depend upon his being able to fulfil the promi&s;es which he had made. He applied for aid to Solyman, whom he courted after his father's example, as his mo&s;t vigorous auxiliary again&s;t the Emperor, and &s;ol|licited him to &s;econd his operations by &s;ending a pow|erful fleet into the Mediterranean. It was not difficult to obtain what he reque&s;ted of the Sultan, who, at this time, was highly incen&s;ed again&s;t the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, on account of their proceedings in Hungary. He ordered an hundred and fifty &s;hips to be equipped, that they might &s;ail towards the coa&s;t of Naples, at whatever time Henry &s;hould name, and might co|operate with the French troops in their attempts upon that kingdom. The command of this fleet was given to the cor&s;air Dragu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, an officer trained up under

<P>AS the French had never given &s;o &s;evere a check to the Emperor in any former campaign, they expre&s;s|ed immoderate joy at the &s;ucce&s;s of their arms. Charles him&s;elf, accu&s;tomed to a long &s;eries of pro&s;perity, felt the blow mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly, and retired from Metz into the Low-Countries, much dejected with the cruel re|ver&s;e of fortune which affected him in his declining age, when the violence of the gout had increa&s;ed to &s;uch a pitch, as entirely broke the vigour of his con|&s;titution, and rendered him peevi&s;h, difficult of ac|ce&s;s, and often incapable of applying to bu&s;ine&s;s. But whenever he enjoyed any interval of ea&s;e, all his thoughts were bent upon revenge; and he deliberat|ed, with the utmo&s;t &s;ollicitude, concerning the mo&s;t proper means of annoying France, and of effacing the &s;tain which had ob&s;cured the reputation and glory of his arms. All the &s;chemes concerning Germany, which had engro&s;&s;ed him &s;o long, being di&s;concerted by the peace of Pa&s;&s;au, the affairs of the Empire be|came only &s;econdary objects of attention; and enmity to France was the predominant pa&s;&s;ion which chiefly occupied his mind.</P>
<P>THE turbulent ambition of Albert of Branden|burgh excited violent commotions, which di&s;turbed the Empire during this year. That Prince's troops having &s;hared in the calamities of the &s;iege of Metz, were greatly reduced in number. But the Emperor, prompted by gratitude for his di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;ervices

on that occa&s;ion, or perhaps with a &s;ecret view of fo|menting divi&s;ions among the Princes of the Empire, having paid up all the money due to him, he was en|abled, by that &s;um, to hire &s;o many of the &s;oldiers, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the Imperial army, that he was &s;oon at the head of a body of men as numerous as ever. The bi&s;hops of Bamberg and Wurtzburg having &s;ol|licited the Imperial chamber to annul, by its authori|ty, the iniquitous conditions which Albert had com|pelled them to &s;ign, than court unanimou&s;ly finding all their engagements with him to be void in their own nature, becau&s;e they had been extorted by force; enjoined Albert to renounce all claim to the perform|ance of them; and exhorted all the Princes of the Empire, if he &s;hould per&s;i&s;t in &s;uch an unju&s;t demand, to take arms again&s;t him, as a di&s;turber of the publick tranquillity. To this deci&s;ion, Albert oppo&s;ed the confirmation of his tran&s;actions with the two prelates, which the Emperor had granted him as the reward of his having joined the Imperial army at Metz; and in order to intimidate his antagoni&s;ts, and to convince them of his re&s;olution not to relinqui&s;h his preten&s;i|ons, he put his troops in motion, that be might &s;e|cure the territory in que&s;tion. Various endeavours were employed, and many expedients propo&s;ed, in order to prevent the kindling a new war in Germany. But the &s;ame warmth of temper which rendered Albert turbulent and enterprizing, in&s;piring him with the mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, even in his wilde&s;t un|dertakings, he di&s;dainfully rejected all rea&s;onable o|vertures of accommodation.</P>
<P>UPON this, the Imperial chamber i&s;&s;ued its decree again&s;t him, and required the Elector of Saxony, to|gether with &s;everal other Princes mentioned by name, to take arms in order to carry it into execution. Mau|rice and tho&s;e a&s;&s;ociated with him were not unwilling to undertake this &s;ervice. They were extremely &s;ol|licitous to maintain publick order, by &s;upporting the au|thority of the Imperial chamber, and &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of giving a timely check to the u&s;urpations of an am|bitious Prince who had no principle of action but re|gard to his own intere&s;t, and no motive to direct him

but the impul&s;e of ungovernable pa&s;&s;ions. They had good rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that the Emperor encouraged Albert in his extravagant an irregular proceedings, and &s;ecretly afforded him a&s;&s;i&s;tance, that, by rai&s;ing him up to rival Maurice in power, he might, in any future broil, make u&s;e of his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to counterba|lance and controul the authority which the other had acquired in the Empire <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 585.

<P>THESE con&s;iderations united the mo&s;t powerful Princes in Germany in a league again&s;t Albert, of which Maurice was declared generali&s;&s;imo. This for|midable confederacy, however, wrought no change in Albert's &s;entiments; but as he knew that he could not re&s;i&s;t &s;o many Princes, if he &s;hould allow them time to a&s;&s;emble their forces, he endeavoured, by his activi|ty, to deprive them of all the advantage which they might derive from their united power and numbers; and, for that rea&s;on, marched directly again&s;t Mau|rice, the enemy whom he dreaded mo&s;t. It was hap|py for the allies, that the conduct of their affairs was committed to a Prince of &s;uch abilities. He, by his authority and example, had in&s;pired them with vigour, and having carried on their preparations with a degree of rapidity, of which confederate bodies are &s;eldom capable, he was in condition to face Albert be|fore he could make any con&s;iderable progre&s;s.</P>
<P>THEIR armies, which were nearly equal in number, each con&s;i&s;ting of twenty-four thou&s;and men, met at Sieverhau&s;en in the dutchy of Lunenburgh; and the violent animo&s;ity again&s;t each other, which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the two leaders, did not &s;uffer them to continue long inactive. The troops, inflamed with the &s;ame ho&s;tile rage, marched fiercely to the combat; they fought with the greate&s;t ob&s;tinacy; and as both generals were capable of availing them&s;elves of every favoura|ble occurrence, the battle remained long doubtful, each gaining ground upon the other alternately. At la&s;t victory declared for Maurice, who was &s;uperior in cavalry, and Albert's army fled in confu&s;ion, leaving four thou&s;and dead in the field, and their camp, bag|gage

and artillery in the hands of the conquerors. The allies bought their victory dear, their be&s;t troops &s;uf|fered greatly, two &s;ons of the Duke of Brun&s;wick, a Duke of Lunenburg, and many other per&s;ons of di&s;|tinction, were among the number of the &s;lain <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;toria pugnae infelicis inter Maurit. &amp; Albert.

But all the&s;e were &s;oon forgotten, for Maurice him&s;elf, as he led up to a &s;econd charge a body of hor&s;e which had been broken, received a wound with a pi&s;tol bullet in the belly, of which he died two days after the battle, in the thirty-&s;econd year of his age, and in the &s;ixth after his attaining the electoral dignity.</P>
<P>OF all the per&s;onages who have appeared in the hi&s;tory of this active age, when great occurrences, and &s;udden revolutions, called forth extraordinary talents to view, and afforded them full opportunity to di&s;play them&s;elves, Maurice may ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as the mo&s;t remarkable. If his exorbitant ambition, his profound di&s;&s;imulation, and his unwarrantable u|&s;urpation of his kin&s;man's honours and dominions ex|clude him from being prai&s;ed as a virtuous man; his prudence in concerting his mea&s;ures, his vigour in executing them, and the uniform &s;ucce&s;s with which they were attended, entitle him to the appellation of a great Prince. At an age, when impetuo&s;ity of &s;pi|rit commonly predominates over political wi&s;dom, when the highe&s;t efforts even of a genius of the fir&s;t order is to fix on a bold &s;cheme, and to execute it with promptitude and courage, he formed and con|ducted an intricate plan of policy, which deceived the mo&s;t artful Monarch in Europe. At the very junc|ture when the Emperor had attained almo&s;t unlimited de&s;poti&s;m, Maurice, with power &s;eemingly inadequate to &s;uch an undertaking, compelled him to relinqui&s;h all his u&s;urpations, and e&s;tabli&s;hed, not only the reli|gious, but civil, liberties of Germany on &s;uch foun|dations, as have hitherto remained un&s;haken. Al|though at one period of his life, his conduct excited the jealou&s;y of the Prote&s;tants, and at another drew on him the re&s;entment of the Roman Catholicks,
<PB N="201" REF="011837_1048_0F9D891B30929200">
&s;uch was his ma&s;terly addre&s;s, that he was the only Prince of the age, who in any degree po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the confidence of both, and whom both lamented as the mo&s;t able as well as faithful guardian of the con&s;tituti|on and laws of his country.</P>
<P>THE con&s;ternation which Maurice's death occa&s;ion|ed among his troops, prevented them from making the proper improvement of the victory which they had gained. Albert, who&s;e active courage, and pro|fu&s;e liberality, rendered him the darling of &s;uch mili|tary adventurers as were little &s;ollicitous about the ju&s;tice of his cau&s;e, &s;oon re-a&s;&s;embled his broken for|ces, and made fre&s;h levies, with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that he was quickly at the head of fifteen thou&s;and men, and renewed his depredations with additional fury. But Henry of Brun&s;wick, having taken the command of the allied troops, defeated him in a &s;econd battle, &s;carce le&s;s bloody than the former. Even then his courage did not &s;ink, nor were his re&s;ources exhau&s;t|ed. He made &s;everal efforts, and &s;ome of them very vigorous, to retrieve his affairs: but, being laid un|der the ban of the Empire by the Imperial chamber, being driven by degrees out of all his hereditary ter|ritories, as well as tho&s;e which he had u&s;urped; being for&s;aken by many of his officers, and overpowered by the number of his enemies, he fled for refuge into France. After having been, for a con&s;iderable time, the terror and &s;courge of Germany, he linger|ed out a few years in an indigent and dependant &s;tate of exile, the mi&s;eries of which his re&s;tle&s;s and arrogant &s;pirit endured with the mo&s;t indignant impatience. Upon his death without i&s;&s;ue, his territories, which had been &s;eized by the Princes who took arms again&s;t him, were re&s;tored, by a decree of the Emperor, to his collateral heirs of the hou&s;e of Brandenburgh <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sleid. 592. 945. 599.

Augu&s;tus, Maurice's only brother, pleaded his right not only to the hereditary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of their family, but to the electoral dignity and to the territories which Maurice had acquired. As Augu&s;|tus was a Prince of con&s;iderable abilities, as well as of great candour and gentlene&s;s of manners, the States of Saxony, forgetting the merits and &s;ufferings of their former ma&s;ter, declared warmly in his favour.

<P>DURING the&s;e tran&s;actions in Germany, war was carried on in the Low-Countries with con&s;iderable vigour. The Emperor, impatient to efface the &s;tain which his ignominious repul&s;e at Metz left upon his his military reputation, had an army early in the field, and laid &s;iege to Terouane. Though the town was of &s;uch importance that Francis u&s;ed to call it one of the two pillows on which a King of France might &s;leep with &s;ecurity, the fortifications were in di&s;repair; Henry, tru&s;ting to what had happened at Metz, thought nothing more was nece&s;&s;ary to render all the efforts of the enemy abortive, than to reinforce the garri&s;on with a con&s;iderable number of the young nobility. But d'E&s;&s;e, a veteran officer who commanded them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lled, and the Imperiali&s;ts pu&s;hing the &s;iege with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> and per&s;everance, the place was taken

by a&s;&s;ault. That it might not fall again into the hands of the French, Charles ordered not only the fortifications but the town to be ra&s;ed, and the inhabitants to be di&s;per&s;ed in the adjacent cities. Elated with this &s;uc|ce&s;s, the Imperiali&s;ts immediately inve&s;ted He&s;din, which though defended with great bravery, was like|wi&s;e taken by a&s;&s;ault, and &s;uch of the garri&s;on as e&s;ca|ped the &s;word were made pri&s;oners. The Emperor entru&s;ted the conduct of this &s;iege to Emanuel Phili|bert of Savoy Prince of Piedmont, who, on that oc|ca&s;ion, gave the fir&s;t di&s;play of his great talents for military command, which &s;oon entitled him to be ranked among the fir&s;t generals of that age, and faci|litated his re-e&s;tabli&s;hment in his hereditary dominions, the greater part of which having been over-run by Francis in his expeditions into Italy, were &s;till occupi|ed by Henry <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thuan. 411.

<P>THE lo&s;s of the&s;e towns, together with &s;o many per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, either killed or taken by the enemy, was no incon&s;iderable calamity to France, and Henry felt it very &s;en&s;ibly; but he was &s;till more mortified at the Emperor's having a&s;&s;umed his wonted &s;uperiority in the field &s;o &s;oon after the blow at Metz, which the French had repre&s;ented as fatal to his power. He was a&s;hamed, too, of his own remi&s;&s;ne&s;s and ex|ce&s;&s;ive &s;ecurity at the opening of the campaign; and, in order to repair that error, he a&s;&s;embled a numerous army, and led it into the Low-Countries.</P>

<P>THE Imperial arms did not make the &s;ame progre&s;s in Italy. The narrowne&s;s of the Emperor's finances &s;eldom allowed him to act with vigour in two different places at the &s;ame time; and having exerted him&s;elf to the utmo&s;t in order to make a great effort in the Low-Countries, his operations on the other &s;ide of the Alps were proportionally feeble. The viceroy of Na|ples, in conjunction with Co&s;mo di Medici, who was greatly alarmed at the introduction of French troops into Siena, endeavoured to become ma&s;ter of that city. But in&s;tead of reducing the Siene&s;e, the Imperiali&s;ts were obliged to retire abruptly in order to defend their own country, upon the appearance of the Turki&s;h fleet, which threatned the coa&s;t of Naples; and the French not only e&s;tabli&s;hed them&s;elves more firmly in Tu&s;cany, but by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Turks, conquer|ed a great part of the i&s;land of Cor&s;ica, &s;ubject, at that time, to the Genoe&s;e <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Thuan. 417.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE affairs of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria declined no le&s;s in Hungary during the cour&s;e of this year. As the troops which Ferdinand kept in Tran&s;ylvania receiv|ed their pay very irregularly, they lived almo&s;t at di&s;|cretion upon the inhabitants; and their in&s;olence and rapaciou&s;ne&s;s greatly di&s;gu&s;ted all ranks of men, and alienated them from their new &s;overeign, who, in|&s;tead of protecting, plundered his &s;ubjects. Their in|dignation at this, added to their de&s;ire of revenging Martinuzzi's death, wrought &s;o much upon a turbu|lent nobility, impatient of injury, and upon a fierce people, prone to change, that they were ripe for a re|volt. At that very juncture, their late Queen, I&s;a|bella, together with her &s;on, appeared in Tran&s;ylvania. Her ambitious mind could not bear the &s;olitude and inactivity of a private life, and repenting quickly of the ce&s;&s;ion which &s;he had made of the crown, in the year one thou&s;and five hundred and fifty-one, &s;he left the place of her retreat, hoping that the di&s;&s;atisfaction of the Hungarians with the Au&s;trian government,
<PB N="214" REF="011837_1052_0F9D891D7805BC60">
would prompt them to recognize once more her &s;on's right to the crown. Some noblemen of great emi|nence declared immediately in his favour. The Ba|&s;haw of Belgrade, by Solyman's order, e&s;pou&s;ed his cau&s;e in oppo&s;ition to Ferdinand; the Spani&s;h and German &s;oldiers, in&s;tead of advancing again&s;t the enemy, mutinied for want of pay, declaring that they would march back to Vienna; &s;o that Ca&s;taldo, their general, was obliged to abandon Tran&s;ylvania to I&s;a|bella and the Turks, and to place him&s;elf at the head of the mutiniers, that by his authority he might re|&s;train them from plundering the Au&s;trian territories, through which they pa&s;&s;ed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thuan. 430.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FERDINAND's attention was turned &s;o entirely to|wards the affairs of Germany, and his trea&s;ures &s;o much exhau&s;ted by his late efforts in Hungary, that he made no attempt to recover this valuable province, although a favourable opportunity for that purpo&s;e pre&s;ented it&s;elf, as Solyman was then engaged in a war with Per&s;ia, and involved be&s;ides in dome&s;tick calamities which engro&s;&s;ed and di&s;turbed his mind. Solyman, though di&s;tingui&s;hed, by many accompli&s;h|ments, from the other Ottoman Princes, had all the pa&s;&s;ions peculiar to that violent and haughty race. He was jealous of his authority, &s;udden and furious in his anger, and &s;u&s;ceptible of all that rage of love, which reigns in the Ea&s;t, and often produces the wilde&s;t and mo&s;t tragical effects. His favourite mi&s;tre&s;s was a Cir|ca&s;&s;ian &s;lave, of exqui&s;ite beauty, who bore him a &s;on called Mu&s;tapha, whom, both on account of his birth-right and merit, he de&s;tined to be the heir of his crown. Roxalana, a Ru&s;&s;ian captive, &s;oon &s;upplant|ed the Circa&s;&s;ian, and gained the Sultan's heart. Hav|ing the addre&s;s to retain the conque&s;t which &s;he had made, &s;he kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his love without any rival for many years, during which &s;he brought him &s;everal &s;ons and one daughter. All the happine&s;s, however, which &s;he derived from the unbounded &s;way that &s;he had acquired over a monarch, whom one half of the world revered or dreaded, was embittered by perpe|tual reflections on Mu&s;tapha's acce&s;&s;ion to the throne,
<PB N="215" REF="011837_1053_0F9D891E2EB91AF8">
and the certain death of her &s;ons, who &s;he fore&s;aw would be immediately &s;acrificed, according to the bar|barous jealou&s;y of Turki&s;h policy, to the &s;afety of the new Emperor. By dwelling continually on this me|lancholy idea, &s;he came gradually to view Mu&s;tapha as the enemy of her children, and to hate him with more than a &s;tep-mother's ill-will. This prompted her to wi&s;h his de&s;truction, in order to &s;ecure for one of her own &s;ons the throne which was de&s;tined for him. Nor did &s;he want either ambition to attempt &s;uch a high enterprize, or the arts requi&s;ite for carry|ing it into execution. Having prevailed on the Sul|tan to give her only daughter in marriage to Ru&s;tan the Grand Vi&s;ier, &s;he di&s;clo&s;ed her &s;cheme to that crafty mini&s;ter, who, perceiving that it was his own intere&s;t to co-operate with her, readily promi&s;ed his a&s;&s;i&s;tance towards aggrandizing that branch of the royal line, to which he was now &s;o nearly allied.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as Roxalana had concerted her mea&s;ures with this able confident, &s;he began to affect a wonder|ful zeal for the Mahometan religion, to which Soly|man was &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly attached, and propo&s;ed to found and endow a royal Mo&s;que, a work of great ex|pence, but deemed by the Turks meritorious in the highe&s;t degree. The Mufti whom &s;he con&s;ulted ap|proved much of her pious intention; but, having been gained and in&s;tructed by Ru&s;tan, told her that &s;he being a &s;lave could derive no benefit her&s;elf from that holy deed, for all the merit of it would accrue to Solyman, the ma&s;ter who&s;e property &s;he was. Upon this &s;he &s;eemed to be overwhelmed with &s;orrow, and to &s;ink into the deepe&s;t melancholy, as if &s;he had been di&s;gu&s;t|ed with life and all its enjoyments. Solyman, who was ab&s;ent with the army, being informed of this dejecti|on of mind, and of the cau&s;e from which it proceeded, di&s;covered all the &s;ollicitude of a lover to remove it, and by a writing under his hand declared her a free woman. Roxalana having gained this point, proceeded to build the Mo&s;que, and re-a&s;&s;umed her u&s;ual chearfulne&s;s and gaiety of &s;pirit. But when Solyman, on his return to Con&s;tantinople, &s;ent an eunuch, according to the cu&s;tom of the &s;eraglio, to bring her to partake of his bed, &s;he,
<PB N="216" REF="011837_1054_0F9D891EF1A5FDD0">
&s;eemingly with deep regret, but in the mo&s;t peremptory manner, declined to follow the eunuch, declaring that what had been an honour to her while a &s;lave, became a crime, as &s;he was now a free woman, and that &s;he would not involve either the Sultan or her&s;elf in the guilt that mu&s;t be contracted by &s;uch an open violation of the law of their prophet. Solyman, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ion this difficulty, as well as the affected delicacy which gave ri&s;e to it, heightened and inflamed, had recour&s;e im|mediately to the Mufti for his direction. He replied, agreeably to the Koran, that Roxalana's &s;cruples were well founded, but added, artfully, in words which Ru&s;tan had taught him to u&s;e, that it was in the Sul|tan's power to remove the&s;e difficulties, by e&s;pou&s;ing her as his lawful wife. The amorous monarch clo&s;ed eagerly with the propo&s;al, and &s;olemnly married her according to the form of the Mahometan ritual; tho' by doing &s;o, he di&s;regarded a maxim of policy which the pride of the Ottoman blood had taught all the Sultans &s;ince Bajezet I. to con&s;ider as inviolable. From his time, none of the Turki&s;h monarchs had married, becau&s;e, when he was vanqui&s;hed and taken pri&s;oner by Tamerlane, his wife had been abu&s;ed with barbarous in&s;olence by the Tartars. That no &s;imilar calamity might &s;ubject the Ottoman family to the like di&s;grace, the Sultans admitted none to their bed but &s;laves, who&s;e di&s;honour could not bring any &s;uch &s;tain upon their hou&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT the more uncommon the &s;tep was, the more it convinced Roxalana of the unbounded influence which &s;he had acquired over the Sultan's heart; and emboldened her to pro&s;ecute, with greater hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, the &s;cheme that &s;he had formed in order to de&s;troy Mu&s;tapha. This young Prince having been intru&s;ted by his father, according to the practice of the Sultans in that age, with the government of &s;eve|ral different provinces, was at that time inve&s;ted with the admini&s;tration in Diarbequir, the ancient Me&s;o|potamia, which Solyman had wre&s;ted from the Per&s;i|ans, and added to his empire. In all the&s;e different commands, Mu&s;tapha had conducted him&s;elf with &s;uch cautious prudence as could give no offence to his
<PB N="217" REF="011837_1055_0F9D891FB35B08A0">
father, though at the &s;ame time, he governed with &s;o much moderation as well as ju&s;tice, and di&s;played &s;uch valour and genero&s;ity as rendered him equally the favourite of the people and the darling of the &s;oldiery.</P>
<P>THERE was no room to lay any folly or vice to his charge, that could impair the high opinion which his father entertained of him. Roxalana's malevolence was more refined, &s;he turned his virtues again&s;t him, and made u&s;e of the&s;e as engines for his de&s;truction. She often mentioned, in Solyman's pre&s;ence, the &s;plendid qualities of his &s;on; &s;he celebrated his cou|rage, his liberality, his popular arts, with malicious and exaggerated prai&s;e. As &s;oon as &s;he pereeived that the Sultan heard the&s;e encomiums, which were often repeated, with unea&s;ine&s;s; that &s;u&s;picion of his &s;on began to mingle it&s;elf with his former e&s;teem for him; and that by degrees he came to view him with jealou&s;y and fear, &s;he introduced, as by accident, &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e concerning the rebellion of his father Selim again&s;t Bajazet his grandfather; &s;he took notice of the bravery of the veteran troops under Mun&s;tapha's command, and of the neighbourhood of Diarbequir to the territories of the Per&s;ian Sophi. Solyman's mortal enemy. By the&s;e arts whatever remained of paternal tenderne&s;s was entirely extingui&s;hed, and &s;uch pa&s;&s;ions were kindled in his brea&s;t, as gave all Roxalana's malignant &s;ugge&s;tions the colour not only of probability but truth. A deep rooted hatred &s;uc|ceeded, now, to his &s;u&s;picions and fear of Mu&s;tapha. He appointed &s;pies to ob&s;erve and report all his words and actions; he watched and &s;tood on his guard again&s;t him as his mo&s;t dangerous enemy.</P>
<P>HAVING thus alienated the Sultan's heart from Mu&s;tapha, Roxalana ventured upon another &s;tep, and entreated Solyman to allow her own &s;ons the liber|ty of appearing at court, hoping that, by gaining ac|ce&s;s to their father, they might, by their good quali|ties and dutiful deportment, in&s;inuate them&s;elves into that place in his affections, which Mu&s;tapha had for|merly held; and, though what &s;he demanded was con|trary to the practice of the Ottoman family in that age, the uxorious monarch granted her reque&s;t. To
<PB N="218" REF="011837_1056_0F9D8920732A1178">
all the&s;e female intrigues Ru&s;tan added an artifice &s;till more &s;ubtle, which compleated the Sultan's delu&s;ion, and heightened his jealou&s;y and fear. He wrote to the Ba&s;haws of the provinces adjacent to Diarbequir, in&s;tructing them to &s;end him regular intelligence of Mu&s;tapha's proceedings in his government, and to each of them he gave a private hint, flowing, in ap|pearance, from his zeal for their intere&s;t, that nothing would be more acceptable to the Sultan, than to re|ceive favourable accounts of a &s;on, whom he de&s;tined to &s;u&s;tain the glory of the Ottoman name. The Ba|&s;haws, ignorant of his fraudulent intention, and eager to pay court to their &s;overeign at &s;uch an ea&s;y price, filled their letters with &s;tudied but fatal panegyricks of Mu&s;tapha, repre&s;enting him as a Prince worthy to &s;ucceed &s;uch an illu&s;trious father, and as endowed with talents which might enable him to emulate, perhaps to equal his fame. The&s;e letters were indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;hewn to Solyman, at the &s;ea&s;ons when it was known that they would make the deepe&s;t impre&s;&s;ion. Every expre&s;&s;ion in recommendation of his &s;on wounded him to the heart; he &s;u&s;pected his principal officers of being ready to favour the mo&s;t de&s;perate attempts of a Prince whom they were &s;o fond to prai&s;e; and fan|cying that he &s;aw them already a&s;&s;aulting his throne with rebellious arms, he determined, while it was yet in his power, to anticipate the blow, and to &s;e|cure his own &s;afety by his &s;on's death.</P>
<P>FOR this purpo&s;e, though under pretence of renew|ing the war again&s;t Per&s;ia, he ordered Ru&s;tan to march towards Diarbequir at the head of a numerous army, and to rid him of a &s;on, who&s;e life he deemed incon&s;i&s;tent with his own &s;afety. But that crafty mini&s;ter did not choo&s;e to be loaded with the odium of having executed this cruel order. As &s;oon as he arrived in Syria he wrote to Solyman, that the dan|ger was &s;o imminent as called for his immediate pre|&s;ence; that the camp was full of Mu&s;tapha's emi&s;&s;aries; that many of the &s;oldiers were corrupted; that the af|fections of all leaned towards him; that he di&s;cover|ed a negociation which had been carried on with the Sophi of Per&s;ia, in order to marry Mu&s;tapha with one
<PB N="219" REF="011837_1057_0F9D892130B934A0">
his daughters; that he already felt both his talents and his authority to be inadequate to the exigencies of &s;uch an arduous conjecture, that the Sultan alone had &s;agacity to di&s;cern what re&s;olution &s;hould be taken in tho&s;e circum&s;tances, and power to carry that re&s;o|lution into execution.</P>
<P>THIS charge of courting the friend&s;hip of the So|phi, Roxalana and Ru&s;tan had re&s;erved as the la&s;t and mo&s;t envenomed of all their calumnies. It operated with the violence which they expected from Solyman's inveterate abhorrence of the Per&s;ians, and threw him into the wilde&s;t tran&s;ports of rage. He &s;et out in&s;tant|ly for Syria, and ha&s;tened thither with all the precipi|tation and impatience of fear and revenge. As &s;oon as he joined his army near Aleppo, and had concerted mea&s;ures with Ru&s;tan, he &s;ent a Chiaus or me&s;&s;enger of the court to his &s;on, requiring him to repair imme|diately to his pre&s;ence. Mu&s;tapha, though no &s;tran|ger to his &s;tep-mother's machinations, or to Ru&s;tan's malice, or to his father's violent temper, yet relying on his innocence, and hoping to di&s;credit the accu&s;a|tions of his enemies by the promptitude of his obedi|ence, followed the me&s;&s;enger without delay to Aleppo. The moment he arrived in the camp, he was intro|duced into the Sultan's tent. As he entered it, he ob&s;erved nothing that could give him any alarm; no additional croud of attendants, no body of armed guards, but the &s;ame order and &s;ilence which always reign in the Sultan's apartments. In a few minutes, however, &s;everal mutes appeared, at the &s;ight of whom Mu&s;tapha, knowing what was his doom, cried with a loud voice, "Lo, my death!" and attempted to fly. The mutes ru&s;hed forward to &s;eize him, he re|&s;i&s;ted and &s;truggled, demanding with the utmo&s;t earne&s;t|ne&s;s to &s;ee the Sultan; and de&s;pair, together with the hope of finding protection from the &s;oldiers, if he could e&s;cape out of the tent, animated him with &s;uch ex|traordinary &s;trength, that for &s;ome time, he ba&s;&s;led all the efforts of the executioners. Solyman was within hearing of his &s;on's cries, as well as of the noi&s;e which the &s;truggle occa&s;ioned. Impatient of this delay of his revenge, and &s;truck with terror at the thought of
<PB N="220" REF="011837_1058_0F9D8922A0B1E368">
Mu&s;tapha's e&s;caping, he drew a&s;ide the curtain which divided the tent, and thru&s;ting in his head, darted a fierce look towards the mutes, and with wild and threatning ge&s;tures &s;eemed to chide them for &s;loth and timidity. At &s;ight of his father's furious and unre|lenting countenance, Mu&s;tapha's &s;trength failed, and his courage for&s;ook him; the mutes fa&s;tened the bow|&s;tring about his neck, and in a moment put an end to his life.</P>
<P>THE dead body was expo&s;ed before the Sultan's tent. The &s;oldiers gathered round it, and contem|plating that mournful object with a&s;toni&s;hment, and &s;orrow, and indignation, were ready, if a leader had not been wanting, to have broke into the wilde&s;t ex|ce&s;&s;es of rage. After giving vent to the fir&s;t expre&s;&s;i|ons of their grief, they retired each man to his tent, and &s;hutting them&s;elves up, bewailed in &s;ecret the cruel fate of their favourite; nor was there one of them who ta&s;ted food or even water during the re|mainder of that day. Next morning, the &s;ame &s;oli|tude and &s;ilence reigned in the camp; and Solyman, being afraid that &s;ome dreadful &s;torm would follow this &s;ullen calm, in order to appea&s;e the enraged &s;ol|diers, deprived Ru&s;tan of the &s;eals, ordered him to leave the camp, and rai&s;ed Achmet, a gallant officer much beloved in the army, to the dignity of Vi&s;ier. This change, however, was made in concert with Ru&s;tan him&s;elf; that crafty mini&s;ter &s;ugge&s;ting it as the only expedient which could &s;ave him&s;elf or his ma&s;ter. But within a few months, when the re&s;ent|ment of the &s;oldiers began to &s;ub&s;ide, and the name of Mu&s;tapha to be forgotten, Achmet was &s;trangled by the Sultan's command, and Ru&s;tan re-in&s;tated in the office of Vi&s;ier. Together with his former pow|er, he rea&s;&s;umed the plan for extirminating the race of Mu&s;tapha which he had concerted with Roxalana; and, as they were afraid that an only &s;on whom Mu|&s;tapha had left, might grow up to avenge his death, they redoubled their activity, and, by employing the &s;ame arts again&s;t him which they had practi&s;ed again&s;t his father, they in&s;pired Solyman with the &s;ame fears, and prevailed on him to i&s;&s;ue orders for putting to

<P>SUCH a tragical &s;cene, productive of &s;o deep di&s;tre&s;s, &s;eldom occurs but in the hi&s;tory of the great monar|chies of the Ea&s;t, where the force of the climate works up and &s;ublimes all the pa&s;&s;ions of the human mind into the greate&s;t fury, and the ab&s;olute power of &s;o|vereigns enables them to act with uncontrouled vio|lence; but while it pa&s;&s;ed in the court of Solyman and engaged his whole attention, Charles was pur&s;uing with the utmo&s;t ardour a new &s;cheme for aggrandiz|ing his family. About this time, Edward the &s;ixth of England, after a &s;hort reign, in which he di&s;play|ed &s;uch virtues as filled his &s;ubjects with &s;anguine hopes of being happy under his government, and made them bear with patience all that they &s;uffered from the weakne&s;s, the di&s;&s;entions, and the ambition of the mini&s;ters who a&s;&s;umed the admini&s;tration during his minority, was &s;eized with a lingering di&s;temper which threatened his life. The Emperor no &s;ooner re|ceived an account of this, than his ambition, always attentive to &s;eize every opportunity of acquiring an in|crea&s;e of power or of territories to his &s;on, &s;ugge&s;ted the thought of adding England to his other kingdoms, by the marriage of Philip with the Prince&s;s Mary, the heir of Edward's crown. Being apprehen&s;ive, however, that his &s;on, who was then in Spain, might decline a match with a Prince&s;s in her thirty-eighth year, and eleven years older than him&s;elf <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Play. hi&s;t.

<P>BUT though Mary was &s;o far advanced in years, and de&s;titute of every charm, either of per&s;on or of manners, that could win affection, or command e|&s;teem, Philip, without he&s;itation, gave his con&s;ent

to the match propo&s;ed by his father, and was willing, according to the u&s;ual maxim of Princes, to &s;acrifice his inclination to his ambition. In order to in&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s, the Emperor, even before Edward's death, began to take &s;uch &s;teps as might facilitate it. Upon Edward's demi&s;e, Mary mounted the throne of En|gland; the preten&s;ions of the lady Jane Gray proving as unfortunate, as they were ill founded &dagger;. Charles &s;ent immediately a pompous emba&s;&s;y to London, to congratulate Mary on her acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, and to propo&s;e the alliance with his &s;on. The Queen, dazzled with the pro&s;pect of marrying the heir of the greate&s;t Monarch in Europe; fond of uniting more clo&s;ely with her mother's family, to which &s;he had been always warmly attached; and eager to &s;ecure the powerful aid which &s;he knew would be nece&s;&s;ary towards carrying on her favourite &s;cheme of re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hing the Romi&s;h religion in England, li&s;tened in the mo&s;t favourable manner to the propo&s;al. Among her &s;ubjects, it met with a very different reception. Philip, it was well known, contended for all the te|nets of the church of Rome with a &s;anguinary zeal, which exceeded the mea&s;ure even of Spani&s;h bi|gotry: this alarmed all the numerous partizans of the Reformation. The Ca&s;tilian haughtine&s;s and re&s;erve were far from being acceptable to the Engli&s;h, who, having &s;everal times &s;een their throne occupied by tho&s;e who were born &s;ubjects, had become accu&s;tom|ed to an unceremonious and familiar intercour&s;e with their &s;overeigns. They could not think, without the utmo&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s, of admitting a foreign Prince to that influence in their councils, which the hu&s;band of their Queen would naturally po&s;&s;e&s;s. They dreaded, both from Philip's over-bearing temper, and from the maxims of the Spani&s;h monarchy which he had imbibed, that he would infu&s;e ideas into the Queen's mind, dangerous to the liberties of the nation, and would introduce foreign troops and money into the kingdom to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in any attempt again&s;t them.</P>

will of their Monarchs, pre&s;ented a warm addre&s;s a|gain&s;t the Spani&s;h match; many pamphlets were pub|li&s;hed, repre&s;enting the dangerous con&s;equences of the alliance with Spain, and de&s;cribing Philip's bigo|try and arrogance in the mo&s;t odious colours. But Mary, inflexible in all her re&s;olutions, paid no regard to the remon&s;trances of her Commons, or to the &s;enti|ments of the people. The Emperor, having &s;ecured, by various arts, the mini&s;ters whom he tru&s;ted mo&s;t, they approved warmly of the match, and large &s;ums were remitted by him in order to gain the re&s;t of the council. Cardinal Pole, whom, the Pope, immediate|ly upon Mary's acce&s;&s;ion, had di&s;patched as his legate into England, in order to reconcile his native country to the &s;ee of Rome, was detained by the Emperor's command at Dillinghen, in Germany, le&s;t by his pre|&s;ence he &s;hould thwart Philip's preten&s;ions, and em|ploy his intere&s;t in favour of his kin&s;man Courtnay Earl of Devon&s;hire, whom the Engli&s;h ardently wi&s;h|ed their &s;overeign to chu&s;e for a hu&s;band <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Palav. hi&s;t.

<P>MEANWHILE, the negociation was carried forward with the greate&s;t rapidity, the Emperor agreeing, without he&s;itation, to every article in favour of En|gland which Mary's mini&s;ters either repre&s;ented as ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;oothe the people and reconcile them to the match, or that was &s;ugge&s;ted by their own fears and jealou&s;y of a foreign ma&s;ter. The chief articles were, that Philip, during his marriage with the Queen, &s;hould bear the title of King of England, but the en|tire admini&s;tration of affairs, as well as the &s;ole di&s;po&s;al of all revenues, offices, and benefices &s;hould remain with the Queen; that the heirs of the marriage &s;hould, together with the crown of England, inherit the dut|chy of Burgundy and the Low-Countries; that if Prince Charles, Philip's only &s;on by a former marri|age, &s;hould die without i&s;&s;ue, his children by the Queen, whether male or female, &s;hould &s;ucceed to the crown of Spain and all the Emperor's hereditary dominions; that before the con&s;ummation of the marriage, Philip &s;hould &s;wear &s;olemnly that he would retain no dome&s;tick who was not a &s;ubject of the

Queen, and would bring no foreigners into the king|dom that might give umbrage to the Engli&s;h; that he would make no alteration in the con&s;titution or laws of England; that he would not carry the Queen, or any of his children born of this marriage, out of the king|dom; that if the Queen &s;hould die before him with|out i&s;&s;ue, he &s;hould leave the crown to the lawful heir, without claiming any right of admini&s;tration what|ever; that England &s;hould not, in con&s;equence of this marriage, be engaged in any war &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between France and Spain; and that the alliance between France and England &s;hould remain in full force <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rymer's Foed. vol. xv. 377. 393.

<P>BUT this treaty, though both the Emperor and Mary's mini&s;ters employed their utmo&s;t addre&s;s in framing it &s;o as to plea&s;e the Engli&s;h, was far from quieting their fears and jealou&s;ies. They &s;aw that words and promi&s;es were a feeble &s;ecurity again&s;t the encroachments of an ambitious Prince, who, as &s;oon as he got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the power and advantages which the Queen's hu&s;band mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily enjoy, could ea&s;ily evade any of the articles that either limited his authority, or ob&s;tructed his &s;chemes. They were convinced that, the more favourable the conditions of the pre&s;ent treaty were to England, the more Philip would be tempted to violate them; and they dread|ed that England, like Naples, Milan, and the other countries annexed to the Spani&s;h crown, would &s;oon feel the intolerable weight of its oppre&s;&s;ive dominati|on, and be con&s;trained, as the&s;e had been, to wa&s;te its wealth and vigour in wars wherein it had no inte|re&s;t, and from which it could derive no advantage. The&s;e &s;entiments prevailed &s;o generally, that every part of the kingdom was filled with di&s;content at the match, and with indignation again&s;t the advi&s;ers of it. Sir Thomas Wyat, a gentleman of &s;ome note, and of good intentions towards the publick, took ad|vantage of this, and rou&s;ed the inhabitants of Kent to arms, in order to &s;ave their country from a foreign yoke. Such numbers re&s;orted in a &s;hort time to his &s;tandard; he marched to London with &s;uch rapidity; and the Queen was &s;o unutterly provided for defence, that the a&s;pect of affairs was extremely threatening,
<PB N="225" REF="011837_1063_0F9D8925B0188000">
and if any nobleman of di&s;tinction had joined the male-contents, or had Wyat po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed talents equal, in any degree, to the boldne&s;s of his enterprize, the in&s;ur|rection mu&s;t have proved fatal to Mary's power. But all his mea&s;ures were concerted with &s;o little prudence, and executed with &s;uch irre&s;olution, that many of his followers for&s;ook him; the re&s;t were di&s;per&s;ed by an handful of men; and he him&s;elf was taken pri&s;oner, without having made any effort worthy of the cau&s;e that he had undertaken, or &s;uitable to the ardour with which he engaged in it. He &s;uffered the pu|ni&s;hment due to his ra&s;hne&s;s and rebellion. The Queen's authority was confirmed and increa&s;ed by her &s;ucce&s;s in defeating this incon&s;iderate attempt to a|bridge it. The lady Jane Gray, who&s;e title the am|bition of her relations had &s;et up in oppo&s;ition to the Queen's, was, notwith&s;tanding her youth and inno|cence, brought to the &s;caffold. The lady Elizabeth, the Queen's &s;i&s;ter, was ob&s;erved with the mo&s;t jea|lous attention. The treaty of marriage was ratified by the parliament.</P>
<P>PHILIP landed in England, with a magnificent re|tinue, celebrated his nuptials with great &s;olemnity, and though he could not lay a&s;ide his natural &s;everity and pride, or a&s;&s;ume gracious and popular manners, he endeavoured to conciliate the favour of the Engli&s;h nobility by his extraordinary liberality. In ca&s;e that &s;hould fail of acquiring him &s;uch influence in the go|vernment of the kingdom, as he aimed at obtaining, the Emperor kept a body of twelve thou&s;and men on the coa&s;t of Flanders, in readine&s;s to embark for Eng|land, and to &s;upport him in all his enterprizes.</P>
<P>EMBOLDENED by all the&s;e favourable circum&s;tan|ces, Mary pur&s;ued the &s;cheme of extirpating the Pro|te&s;tant religion out of her dominions, with the mo&s;t precipitant zeal. The laws of Edward the &s;ixth in fa|vour of the Reformation were repealed; the prote&s;tant clergy ejected; all the forms and rites of the Popi&s;h wor&s;hip were re-e&s;tabli&s;hed; the nation was &s;olemnly ab&s;olved from the guilt which it had contracted during the period of its apo&s;tacy, and was publickly reconcil|ed
<PB N="226" REF="011837_1064_0F9D89266E7EE888">
to the church of Rome, by cardinal Pole, who immediately after the Queen's marriage was permitted to continue his journey to England, and to exerci&s;e his legantine functions with the mo&s;t ample power. Not &s;atisfied with having overturned the Prote&s;tant church, and having e&s;tabli&s;hed her own &s;y&s;tem on its ruins, Mary in&s;i&s;ted that all her &s;ubjects &s;hould con|form to the &s;ame mode of wor&s;hip which &s;he preferred; &s;hould profe&s;s their faith in the &s;ame creed which &s;he had approved; and abjure every practice or opinion that was deemed repugnant to either of them. Pow|ers, altogether unknown in the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, were ve&s;ted in certain per&s;ons appointed to take cog|nizance of here&s;y, and they proceeded to exerci&s;e them with more than inqui&s;itorial &s;everity. The pro&s;pect of danger, however, did not intimidate the teachers of the Prote&s;tant doctrines, who believed that they were contending for truths of the utmo&s;t con&s;e|quence to the happine&s;s of mankind. They boldly avowed their &s;entiments, and were condemned to that cruel death which the church of Rome re&s;erves for its enemies. This &s;hocking puni&s;hment was in|flicted with that barbarity which the rancour of fal&s;e zeal alone can in&s;pire. The Engli&s;h, who are inferi|or in humanity to no people in Europe, and remark|able for the mildne&s;s of their publick executions, be|held, with a&s;toni&s;hment and horror, per&s;ons who had filled the mo&s;t re&s;pectable &s;tations in their church, and who were venerable on account of their age, their pie|ty and their literature, condemned to endure tor|ments, to which even the mo&s;t atrocious criminals were not &s;ubjected.</P>
<P>THIS extreme rigour did not accompli&s;h the end at which Mary aimed. The patience and fortitude with which the&s;e martyrs for the Reformation &s;ubmitted to their &s;uffering, the heroick contempt of death expre&s;|&s;ed by per&s;ons of every rank, and age, and &s;ex, con|firmed many more in the Prote&s;tant faith, than the threats of their enraged per&s;ecutors could frighten in|to apo&s;tacy. The bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;uch as were entru&s;ted with trying of hereticks grew upon them, and ap|peared to be as endle&s;s as it was odious. The Queen's
<PB N="227" REF="011837_1065_0F9D89272E5EA6B8">
able&s;t mini&s;ters became &s;en&s;ible how impolitick as well as dangerous it was to irritate the people, by the fre|quent &s;pectacle of public executions, which they de|te&s;ted both as unju&s;t and cruel. Even Philip was &s;o thoroughly convinced of her having run to an exce&s;s of rigour, that, on this occa&s;ion, he a&s;&s;umed a part to which he was little accu&s;tomed, becoming an advocate for moderation and lenity.</P>
<P>BUT, notwith&s;tanding this attempt to ingratiate him&s;elf with the Engli&s;h, they di&s;covered a con&s;tant jealou&s;y and di&s;tru&s;t of all his intentions; and when &s;ome members, who had been gained by the court, ventured to move in the hou&s;e of Commons that the nation ought to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Emperor, the Queen's fa|ther-in-law, in his war again&s;t France, the propo&s;al was rejected with general di&s;&s;atisfaction. A motion which was made, that the parliament &s;hould give its con&s;ent that Philip might be publickly crowned as the Queen's hu&s;band, met with &s;uch a cold reception that it was in&s;tantly withdrawn &dagger;.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, the King of France had ob&s;erved the progre&s;s of the Emperor's negociation in England with much unea&s;ine&s;s. The great acce&s;&s;ion of territories as well as reputation which his enemy would acquire by the marriage of his &s;on with the Queen of &s;uch a pow|erful kingdom was obvious and formidable. He ea&s;i|ly fore&s;aw that the Engli&s;h, notwith&s;tanding all their fears and precautions, would be &s;oon drawn in to take part in the quarrels on the continent, and be compelled to act in &s;ub&s;erviency to the Emperor's am|bitious &s;chemes. For this rea&s;on, Henry had given it in charge to his amba&s;&s;ador at the court of London, to employ all his addre&s;s in order to defeat or retard the treaty of marriage; and as there was not, at that time, any Prince of the blood in France, whom he could propo&s;e to the Queen as a hu&s;band, he in&s;truct|ed him to co-operate with &s;uch of the Engli&s;h as wi&s;h|ed they &s;overeign to marry one of her own &s;ubjects. But the Queen's ardour and precipitation, in clo&s;ing

<PB N="228" REF="011837_1066_0F9D8927EEBA6700">
with the fir&s;t overtures in favour of Philip, having rendered all his endeavours ineffectual, Henry was &s;o far from thinking it prudent to give any aid to the Engli&s;h malecontents, though earne&s;tly &s;ollicited by Wyat and their other leaders, who tempted him to take them under his protection, by offers of great ad|vantage to France, that he commanded his amba&s;&s;ador to congratulate the Queen in the warme&s;t terms upon the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the in&s;urrection.</P>
<P>BUT, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e external profe&s;&s;ions, he dreaded &s;o much the con&s;equence of this alliance, which more than compen&s;ated for all that the Emperor had lo&s;t in Germany, that he determined to carry on his military operations both in the Low-Countries, and in Italy, with extraordinary vigour, in order that he might compel Charles to accept of an equitable peace, before his daughter-in-law could &s;urmount the aver&s;i|on of her &s;ubjects to a war on the continent, and prevail on them to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Emperor either with mo|ney or troops. For this purpo&s;e, he exerted him&s;elf to the utmo&s;t in order to have a numerous army early a&s;&s;embled on the frontiers of the Netherlands, and while one part of it laid wa&s;te the open country of Ar|tois, the main body, under the Con&s;table Montmoren|cy, advanced towards the provinces of Liege and Hainant by the fore&s;t of Ardennes.</P>
<P>THE campaign was opened with the &s;iege of Mari|emburgh, a town which the Queen of Hungary, the governe&s;s of the Low-Countries, had fortified at great expence; but, being de&s;titute of a &s;ufficient garri&s;on, it &s;urrendered in &s;ix days. Henry, elated with this &s;ucce&s;s, put him&s;elf at the head of his army, and in|ve&s;ting Bouvines, took it by a&s;&s;ault, after a &s;hort re|&s;i&s;tance. With equal facility he became ma&s;ter of Di|nant; and then, turning to the left, bent his march towards the province of Artois. The va&s;t &s;ums which the Emperor had remitted into England, had &s;o ex|hau&s;ted his trea&s;ury, as to render his preparations, at this juncture, flower and more dilatory than u&s;ual. He had no body of troops to make head again&s;t the French at their fir&s;t entrance into his territories; and though he drew together all the forces in the country,
<PB N="229" REF="011837_1067_0F9D8928B30CF070">
in the utmo&s;t hurry, and gave the command of them to Emanuel Philibert of Savoy, they were in no con|dition to face an enemy &s;o far &s;uperior in number. The Prince of Savoy, however, by his activity and good con|duct, made up for his want of troops. By watching all the motions of the French at a di&s;tance, and by chu&s;ing his own po&s;ts with &s;uch &s;kill as put it out of their power either to form any &s;iege of con&s;equence or to attack him, he obliged them to fall back for want of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence towards their own frontiers, after having burnt all the open towns, and having plundered the country through which they marched with a cruelty and licence more becoming a body of light troops than a royal army led by a great monarch.</P>
<P>BUT Henry, that he might not di&s;mi&s;s his army without attempting &s;ome conque&s;t adequate to the va&s;t preparations, as well as &s;anguine hopes with which he had opened the campaign, inve&s;ted Renti, a place deemed in that age of great importance, as, by its &s;i|tuation on the confines of Artois and Boulonnais, it covered the former province, and protected the par|ties which had made incur&s;ions into the latter. The town, which was &s;trongly fortified and provided with a numerous garri&s;on, made a gallant defence; but being warmly pre&s;&s;ed by a powerful army, it mu&s;t &s;oon have yielded. The Emperor, who at that time enjoyed a &s;hort interval of ea&s;e from the gout, was &s;o &s;ollicitous to &s;ave it, that, although he could bear no other motion but that of a litter, he in&s;tantly put him|&s;elf at the head of his army, which having received &s;everal reinforcements was now &s;trong enough to ap|proach the enemy. The French were eager to decide by a battle, what &s;hould be the fate of Renti, and ex|pected it from the Emperor's arrival in the camp; but Charles avoided it with great indu&s;try, and as he had nothing in view but to &s;ave the town, he hoped to ac|compli&s;h that, without expo&s;ing him&s;elf to the con&s;e|quences of &s;uch a dangerous and doubtful event.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all his precautions, a di&s;|pute, about a po&s;t which both armies endeavoured to
<PB N="230" REF="011837_1068_0F9D89297A4413A0">
&s;eize, brought on an engagement which proved al|mo&s;t general. The Duke of Gui&s;e, who command|ed the wing of the French which &s;tood the brunt of the combat, di&s;played valour and conduct worthy of the defender of Metz; the Imperiali&s;ts, after an ob&s;ti|nate &s;truggle, were repul&s;ed; the French remained ma&s;ters of the po&s;t in di&s;pute; and if the Con&s;table, either from his natural caution and &s;lowne&s;s, or from unwillingne&s;s to &s;upport a rival whom he hated, had not delayed bringing up the main body to &s;econd the impre&s;&s;ion which Gui&s;e had made, the rout of the enemy mu&s;t have been complete. The Emperor, notwith&s;tanding the lo&s;s which he had &s;u&s;tained, con|tinued in the &s;ame camp; and the French, being &s;trait|ened for provi&s;ions, and finding it impo&s;&s;ible to carry on the &s;iege in the face of an ho&s;tile army, quitted their intrenchments. They retired openly, courting the enemy to approach, rather than &s;hunning an engage|ment.</P>
<P>BUT Charles, having gained his end, &s;uffered them to march off unmole&s;ted. As &s;oon as his troops en|tered their own country, Henry threw garri&s;ons into the frontier towns, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the re&s;t of the army. This encouraged the Imperiali&s;ts to pu&s;h forward with a con&s;iderable body of troops into Picardy, and by laying wa&s;te the country with fire and &s;word, they en|deavoured to revenge them&s;elves for the ravages which the French had committed in Hainault and Ar|tois <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Thuan. 460, &amp;c. Haraei Ann. Beab. 674.</NOTE>. But as they were not able to reduce any place of importance, they gained nothing more than the enemy had done by this cruel and inglorious method of carrying on the war.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, the arms of France were &s;till more un&s;ucce&s;sful in Italy. The footing which the French had acquired in Siena occa&s;ioned much unea&s;ine&s;s to Co&s;mo di Medici, the mo&s;t &s;agacious and enterprizing of all the Italian Princes. He dreaded the neighbour|hood of a powerful people, to whom all who favour|ed the ancient republican government in Florence would have recour&s;e, as to their natural protector
<PB N="231" REF="011837_1069_0F9D892A347732B8">
again&s;t that ab&s;olute authority which the Emperor had enabled him to u&s;urp; he knew how odious he was to the French, on account of his attatchment to the Imperial party; and he fore&s;aw that if they were per|mitted to gather &s;trength in Siena, Tu&s;cany would &s;oon feel the effects of their re&s;entment. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, he wi&s;hed with the utmo&s;t &s;ollicitude for the expul&s;ion of the French out of the Siene&s;e, before they had time to e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves thoroughly in the country, or to receive &s;uch reinforcements from France as would render it dangerous to attack them. As this, however, was properly the Emperor's bu&s;i|ne&s;s, who was called by his intere&s;t as well as ho|nour to di&s;lodge the&s;e formidable intruders into the heart of his dominions, Co&s;mo laboured to throw the whole burden of the enterprize on him; and on that account had given no a&s;&s;i&s;tance, during the former campaign, but by advancing &s;ome &s;mall &s;ums of mo|ney towards payment of the Imperial troops.</P>
<P>BUT as the defence of the Netherlands engro&s;&s;ed all the Emperor's attention, and his remittances into England had drained his trea&s;ury, it was obvious that his operations in Italy would be extremely feeble; and Co&s;mo plainly perceived that, if he him&s;elf did not take part openly in the war, and act with vigour, the French would &s;carce meet any annoyance. As his &s;ituation rendered this re&s;olution nece&s;&s;ary and un|avoidable, his next care was to execute it in &s;uch a manner, that he might derive from it &s;ome other ad|vantage, be&s;ide that of driving the French out of his neighbourhood. With this view, he di&s;patched an envoy to Charles, and offered to declare war again&s;t France, and to reduce Siena at his own charges, on condition that he &s;hould be repaid whatever he &s;hould expend in the enterprize, and be permitted to re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m all his conque&s;ts until his demands were fully &s;atisfi|ed. Charles, to whom, at this juncture, the war a|gain&s;t Siena was an intolerable burden, and who had neither expedient nor re&s;ource that could enable him to carry it on with proper vigour, clo&s;ed gladly with this overture; and Co&s;mo, well acquainted with the low &s;tate of the Imperial finaces, flattered him&s;elf that

<P>FULL of the&s;e hopes, he made great preparations for war, and as the French King had turned the &s;trength of his arms again&s;t the Netherlands, he did not de&s;|pair of a&s;&s;embling &s;uch a body of men, as would prove more than a &s;ufficient match for any force which he could bring into the field in Italy. He endeavoured to obtain a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the Pope, or at lea&s;t to &s;e|cure his remaining neutral, by giving one of his daughters to that Pontiff's nephew. He attempted to detach the Duke of Or&s;ini, who&s;e family had been long attached to the French party, from his ancient confederates, by be&s;towing on him another of his daughters; and, what was of greater con&s;equence than either of the&s;e, he engaged John James Medeci|no, Marquis of Marignano, to take the command of his army <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Adriani I&s;toria, vol. i. p. 663.</NOTE>. This officer, from a very low condition in life, had rai&s;ed him&s;elf, through all the ranks of &s;ervice, to high command, and had di&s;played talents and acquired reputation in war, which entitled him to be placed on a level with the greate&s;t generals of that martial age. Having attained a &s;tation of emi|nence &s;o di&s;proportionate to his birth, he laboured with a fond &s;ollicitude to conceal his original ob&s;curi|ty, by giving out that he was de&s;cended of the fami|ly of Medici, to which honour the ca&s;ual re&s;emblance of his name was his only preten&s;ion. Co&s;mo, happy that he could gratify him at &s;uch an ea&s;y rate, flatter|ed his vanity in this point, acknowledged him as a re|lation, and permitted him to a&s;&s;ume the arms of his family: Medecino, eager to &s;erve the head of that fa|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, of which he now con&s;idered him&s;elf as a branch, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lied with wonderful zeal and a&s;&s;iduity to rai&s;e troops; and as, during his long &s;ervice, he had ac|quired great credit with the leaders of tho&s;e mercena|ry bands, which forced the &s;trength of Italian armies, he engaged the mo&s;t eminent of them to follow Co&s;|mo's &s;tandard.</P>

He was the &s;on of Philip Strozzi, who, in the year one thou&s;and five hundred and thirty-&s;even, had concurred with &s;uch ardour in the attempt to ex|pel the family of Medici out of Florence, and to re-e&s;ta|bli&s;h the ancient republican form of government; and who had peri&s;hed in the undertaking.

As Co&s;mo &s;u&s;tained the whole burden of military ope|rations, the expence of which mu&s;t have exhau&s;ted his revenues, neither the viceroy of Naples nor go|vernor of Milon were in condition to afford him any aid; and as the troops which Medecino had left in the camp before Siena could attempt nothing again&s;t it during his ab&s;ence; it was Strozzi's bu&s;ine&s;s to have protracted the war, and to have transferred the &s;eat of it into the territories of Florence; but the hope of ruining the enemy with one deci&s;ive blow, precipi|tated him into a general engagement not far from Marciano. The armies were nearly equal in number; but a body of Italian cavalry, in which Strozzi placed great confidence, having fled, either thro' the trea|chery or cowardice of the officers who commanded it, without making any re&s;i&s;tance, the infantry remained expo&s;ed to the attacks of all Medecino's troops. Encouraged, however, by Strozzi's pre&s;ence and ex|ample, who, after receiving a dangerous wound in endeavouring to rally the cavalry, placed him&s;elf at the head of the infantry, and manife&s;ted an admira|ble pre&s;ence of mind, as well as extraordinary valour, they &s;tood their ground with great firmne&s;s, and re|pul&s;ed &s;uch of the enemy as ventured to approach them. But the&s;e gallant troops, being &s;urrounded at la&s;t on every &s;ide, and torn in pieces by a battery of cannon which Medecino brought to bear upon them, the Plorentine cavalry broke in on their flanks, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">neral rout en&s;ued.

he had lei&s;ure to carry on his approaches again&s;t the town without mole&s;tation. But the Siene&s;e, in&s;tead of &s;inking into de&s;pair upon this cruel di&s;appointment of their only hope of obtaining relief, prepared to de|fend them&s;elves to the utmo&s;t extremity, with that undaunted fortitude, which the love of liberty alone can in&s;pire. This generous re&s;olution was warmly &s;e|conded by Monluc, who commanded the French gar|ri&s;on in the town. The active and enterprizing cou|rage which he had di&s;played on many occa&s;ions had procured him this command; and as he had ambition which a&s;pired at the highe&s;t military dignities, with|out any preten&s;ions to attain them but what he could derive from merit, he determined to di&s;tingui&s;h his defence of Siena by extraordinary efforts of valour and per&s;everance. For this purpo&s;e, he, with un|wearied indu&s;try, repaired and &s;trengthened the for|tifications; he trained the citizens to the u&s;e of arms, and accu&s;tomed them to go thro' the fatigues and dan|gers of &s;ervice in common with the &s;oldiers; and as the enemy were extremely &s;trict in guarding all the a|venues to the city, he hu&s;banded the provi&s;ions in the magazines with the mo&s;t par&s;imonious oeconom, and prevailed on the &s;oldiers, as well as the citizens, to re&s;trict them&s;elves to a very moderate daily allowance for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Medecino, though his army was not numerous enough to &s;torm the town by open force, ventured twice to a&s;&s;ault it by &s;urprize, but he was received each time with &s;o much &s;pirit, and repul&s;ed with &s;uch lo&s;s, as di&s;couraged him from repeating the attempt, and left him no hopes of re|ducing the town but by famine.</P>
<P>WITH this view, he fortified his own camp with great care, occupied all the po&s;ts of &s;trength round the place, and having entirely cut off the be&s;ieged from any communication with the adjacent country, he waited patiently until nece&s;&s;ity &s;hould compel them to open their gates. But the enthu&s;ia&s;tick zeal of the citizens for liberty, made them de&s;pi&s;e the inconve|niencies occa&s;ioned by &s;carcity of provi&s;ions, and even &s;upported them long under all the mi&s;eries of famine; Monluc, by his example and exhortations, taught his
<PB N="236" REF="011837_1074_0F9D892DF1986940">
&s;oldiers to vie with them in patience and ab&s;tinence; and it was not until they had with&s;tood a &s;iege of ten months, until they had eaten up all the hor&s;es, dogs, and other animals in the place, and were reduced al|mo&s;t to their la&s;t mor&s;el of bread, that they propo&s;ed a capitulation. Even then, they demanded honourable terms; and as Co&s;mo, though no &s;tranger to the ex|tremity of their condition, was afraid that de&s;pair might prompt them to venture upon &s;ome wild enterprize, he immediately granted them conditions more favour|able than they could have expected.</P>
<P>THE capitulation was made in the Emperor's name, who engaged to take the republick of Siena under the protection of the Empire; he promi&s;ed to maintain the ancient liberties of the city, to allow the magi|&s;trates the full exerci&s;e of their former authority, to &s;ecure the citizens in the undi&s;turbed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their privileges and property; he granted an ample and un|limited pardon to all who had born arms again&s;t him; he re&s;erved to him&s;elf the right of placing a garri&s;on in the town, but engaged not to rebuild the citadel without the con&s;ent of the citizens. Monluc and his French garri&s;on were allowed to march out with all the honours of war.</P>
<P>MEDECINO ob&s;erved the articles of capitulation, &s;o far as depended on him with great exactne&s;s. No vi|olence or in&s;ult whatever was offered to the inhabi|tants, and the French garri&s;on was received with all the re&s;pect due to its &s;pirit and bravery. But many of the citizens &s;u&s;pecting from the extraordinary facility with which they had obtained &s;uch favourable conditions, that the Emperor, as well as Co&s;mo, would take the fir&s;t opportunity of violating them and di&s;daining to po&s;&s;e&s;s a precarious liberty, which depended on the will of another, abandoned the place of their nativity, and accompanied the French to Monte&eacute;-Alcino, Por|to Ercole, and other &s;mall towns in the territory of the republic. They e&s;tabli&s;hed in Monte&eacute;-Alcino the &s;ame model of government to which they had been accu&s;tomed at Siena, and appointing magi&s;trates with the &s;ame titles and juri&s;diction, &s;olaced them&s;elves with this image of their ancient liberty.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="011837_1075_0F9D892F4488A500">THE fears of the Siene&s;e concerning the fate of their country were not imaginary, or their &s;u&s;picion of the Emperor and Co&s;mo ill-founded; for no &s;ooner had the Imperial troops taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town, than Co&s;mo, without regarding the articles of capitulation, not only di&s;placed the magi&s;trates who were in office, and nominated new ones devoted to his intere&s;t, but commanded all the citizens to deliver up their arms to per&s;ons whom he appointed to receive them. They &s;ubmitted to the former from nece&s;&s;ity, though with all the reluctance and regret which men accu&s;tomed to liberty feel in obeying the fir&s;t commands of a ma&s;ter. They did not yield the &s;ame tame obedience to the latter; and many per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, rather than degrade them&s;elves, by &s;urrendering their arms, from the rank of freemen to the condition of &s;laves, fled to their countrymen at Mont&eacute;-Alcino, and cho&s;e to en|dure all the hard&s;hips, and encounter all the dangers which they had rea&s;on to expect in that new &s;tation, where they had fixed the &s;eat of their republick.</P>
<P>COSMO, not reckoning him&s;elf &s;ecure while &s;uch numbers of implacable and de&s;perate enemies were &s;ettled in his neighbourhood, and retained any de|gree of power, &s;ollicited Medecino to attack them in their different places of retreat, before they had time to recruit their &s;trength and &s;pirits, after the many calamities which they had &s;uffered. He prevailed on him, though his army was much weakened by hard duty during the &s;iege of Siena, to inve&s;t Porto Ercole; and the fortifications being both &s;light and incompleat, the be&s;ieged were &s;oon compelled to open their gates. An unexpected order which Medecino received from the Emperor to detach the greater part of his troops into Piedmont, prevented farther operations, and permitted the Siene&s;e exiles to re&s;ide for &s;ome time undi&s;turbed in Mont&eacute;-Alcino. But their unhappy countrymen who remained at Siena, were not yet at the end of their &s;ufferings; for the Emperor in&s;tead of adhering to the articles of capitulation, granted his &s;on Philip the inve&s;titure of that city and all its de|pendencies; and Francis de Toledo, in the name of their new ma&s;ter, proceeded to &s;ettle the civil and

<P>THE Imperial army in Piedmont had been &s;o fee|ble, for &s;ome time, and its commanders &s;o inactive that the Emperor, in order to give vigor to his ope|rations in that, quarter, found it nece&s;&s;ary not only to call off Medecino's troops from Tu&s;cany, while in the career of conque&s;t, but to employ in Piedmont a ge|neral of &s;uch reputation and abilities, as might coun|terbalance the great military talents of the Marchal Bri&s;&s;ac, who was at the head of the French forces in that country.</P>
<P>HE pitched on the Duke of Alva for that purpo&s;e; but it was as much the effect of a court intrigue, as of his opinion of the Duke's merit, which led him to this choice. Alva had long attended Philip with the utmo&s;t a&s;&s;iduity, and had endeavoured to work him|&s;elf into his confidence by all the in&s;inuating arts of which his haughty and inflexible nature was capable. As he nearly re&s;embled that Prince in many features of his character, he began to gain much of his good will. Ruy Gomez de Silva, Philip's favourite, who dreaded the progre&s;s which this formidable rival made in his ma&s;ter's affections, had the addre&s;s to prevail with the Emperor to name Alva to this command. The Duke, though &s;en&s;ible that he owed this di&s;tinc|tion to the malicious arts of an enemy, who had no other aim than to remove him at a di&s;tance from court, was of &s;uch punctilious honour, that he would not decline a command that appeared dangerous and difficult, but, at the &s;ame time, &s;o haughty that he would not accept of it but on his own terms, in&s;i&s;ting on being appointed the Emperor's Vicar General in Italy, with the &s;upreme military command in all the Imperial and Spani&s;h territories in that country. Charles granted all his demands; and he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on of his new dignity with almo&s;t unlimited authority.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="011837_1077_0F9D89302F803B88">HIS fir&s;t operations, however, were neither propor|tioned to his former reputation and the exten&s;ive powers with which he was inve&s;ted, nor did they come up to the Emperor's expectations. Bri&s;&s;ac had under his command an army which, though inferior in number to the Imperiali&s;ts, was compo&s;ed of cho|&s;en troops, which having grown old in &s;ervice in that country, where every town was fortified, and every ca&s;tle capable of being defended, were perfectly ac|quainted with the manner of carrying on war there. By their valour, and his own good conduct, Bri&s;&s;ac not only defeated all the attempts of the Imperiali&s;ts, but added new conque&s;ts to the territories of which he was formerly ma&s;ter. Alva, after having boa&s;ted with his u&s;ual arrogance, that he would drive the French out of Piedmont in a few weeks, was obliged to retire into winter quarters, with the ignominy of being un|able to pre&s;erve entire that part of the country of which the Emperor had hitherto kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Thuan. lib. xv. 52<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.

<P>AS the operations of this campaign in Piedmont were indeci&s;ive, tho&s;e in the Netherlands were incon&s;i|derable, neither the Emperor nor King of France being able to bring into the field an army &s;trong enough to undertake any enterprize of moment. But what Charles wanted in force he endeavoured to &s;up|ply by a bold &s;tratagem, the &s;ucce&s;s of which would have been equal to that of the mo&s;t vigorous campaign. During the &s;iege of Metz, Leonard Father Guardian of a convent of Franci&s;cans in that city had, by his at|tachment to the French intere&s;t, in&s;inuated him&s;elf far into the e&s;teem and favour of the Duke of Gui&s;e. Being a man of an active and intriguing &s;pirit, he had been extremely u&s;eful both in animating the inhabi|tants to &s;u&s;tain with patience all the hard&s;hips of the &s;iege, and in procuring intelligence of the enemies de|&s;igns and motions. The merit of the&s;e important &s;er|vices, together with the warm recommendations of the Duke of Gui&s;e, &s;ecured him &s;uch high confidence with Vielleville, who was appointed governor of Metz, when Gui&s;e left the town, that he was permitted to

conver&s;e or corre&s;pond with whatever per&s;ons he cho&s;e, and nothing that he did created any &s;u&s;picion. This monk, from the levity natural to bold and pro|jecting adventurers; or from re&s;entment again&s;t the French, who had not be&s;towed on him &s;uch rewards as he thought due to his own merit; or tempted, by the unlimited confidence which was placed in him, to imagine that he might carry on and accompli&s;h any &s;cheme with perfect &s;ecurity; formed a de&s;ign of be|traying Metz to the Imperiali&s;ts.</P>
<P>HE communicated his intentions to the Queen-dowager of Hungary, who governed the Low-Coun|tries in name of her brother. She approving, with|out any &s;cruple, an act of treachery, from which the Emperor might derive &s;uch &s;ignal advantage, a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Father Guardian in concerting the mo&s;t proper plan for en&s;uring its &s;ucce&s;s. They agreed that the Father Guardian &s;hould endeavour to gain the monks of his convert to concur in promoting the de&s;ign; that he &s;hould introduce into the convent a certain num|ber of cho&s;en &s;oldiers, di&s;gui&s;ed in the habit of friars; that when every thing was ripe for execution, the governor of Thionville &s;hould march towards Metz in the night with a con&s;iderable body of troops, and at|tempt to &s;cale the ramparts; that while the garri&s;on was employed in re&s;i&s;ting the a&s;&s;ailants, the monks &s;hould &s;et fire to the town in different places; that the &s;oldiers who lay concealed &s;hould &s;ally out of the convent, and attack tho&s;e who defended the ramparts in the rear. Amid&s;t the univer&s;al terror and confu&s;i|on, which events &s;o unexpected would occa&s;ion, it was not doubted but that the Imperiali&s;ts might be|come ma&s;ters of the town. As a recompence for this &s;ervice the Father Guardian &s;tipulated that he &s;hould be appointed bi&s;hop of Metz, and ample rewards were promi&s;ed to &s;uch of his monks as &s;hould be mo&s;t ac|tive in co-operating with him.</P>
<P>THE Father Guardian accompli&s;hed what he had undertaken to perform with great &s;ecrecy and di&s;|patch. By his authority and arguments, as well as by the pro&s;pect of wealth or honours which he &s;et before his monks, he prevailed on all of them to en|ter
<PB N="241" REF="011837_1079_0F9D8931AED303C8">
into the con&s;piracy. He introduced into the con|vent, as many &s;oldiers as were thought &s;ufficient, without being &s;u&s;pected. The governor of Thionvil|le, appri&s;ed in due time of the de&s;ign, had a&s;&s;embled a proper number of troops for executing it; and the moment approached, which probably would have wre&s;ted from Henry the mo&s;t important of all his con|que&s;ts.</P>
<P>BUT happily for France, on the very day that was fixed for &s;triking the blow, Vielleville, an able and vigilant officer, received information from a &s;py whom he entertained at Thionville, that certain Fran|ci&s;can friars re&s;orted frequently thither, and were ad|mitted to many private conferences with the gover|nor, who was carrying on preparations for &s;ome mi|litary enterprize with great di&s;patch, but with a mo&s;t my&s;terious &s;ecrecy. This was &s;ufficient to awaken Viel|leville's &s;u&s;picions. Without communicating the&s;e to any per&s;on, he in&s;tantly vi&s;ited the convent of Fran|ci&s;cans; detected the &s;oldiers who were concealed there; and forced them to di&s;cover as much as they knew concerning the nature of the enterprize. The Father Guardian, who had gone to Thionville that he might put the la&s;t hand to his machinations, was &s;eized at the gate as he returned; and he, in or|der to &s;ave him&s;elf from the rack, revealed all the cir|cum&s;tances of the con&s;piracy.</P>
<P>VIELLEVILLE not &s;atisfied with having &s;eized the traitors, and having fru&s;trated their &s;chemes, was &s;ol|licitous to take advantage of the di&s;coveries which he had made, &s;o as to be revenged on the Imperiali&s;ts. For this purpo&s;e he marched out with the be&s;t troops in his garri&s;on, and placing the&s;e in ambu&s;h near the road, by which the father guardian had informed him that the governor of Thionville would approach Metz, he fell upon the Imperiali&s;ts with great fury, as they advanced in perfect &s;ecurity, without &s;u&s;pecting any danger to be near. Confounded at this &s;udden attack, by an enemy whom they expected to &s;urpri&s;e, they made little re&s;i&s;tance; and a great part of the troops employed in this &s;ervice, among which were many per&s;ons of di&s;tinction, was killed or taken pri&s;oners.

Before next morning, Vielleville returned to Metz in triumph.</P>
<P>NO re&s;olution was taken for &s;ome time concerning the fate of the Father Guardian and his monks, the framers and conductors of this dangerous con&s;piracy. Regard for the honour of a body &s;o numerous and re|&s;pectable as the Franci&s;cans, and unwillingne&s;s to af|ford a &s;ubject of triumph to the enemies of the Romi&s;h church by their di&s;grace, &s;eem to have occa&s;ioned this delay. But at length, the nece&s;&s;ity of inflicting ex|emplary puni&s;hment upon them, in order to deter others from venturing to commit the &s;ame crime, be|came &s;o evident, that orders were i&s;&s;ued to proceed to their trial. Their guilt was made apparent by the cleare&s;t evidence; and &s;entence of death was pa&s;&s;ed upon the Father Guardian together with twenty monks. On the evening previous to the day fixed for their execution, the jailor took them out of the dungeons in which they had hitherto been confined &s;eparately, and &s;hut them all up in one great room, that they might confe&s;s their &s;ins one to another, and join together in preparing for a future &s;tate. But as &s;oon as they were left alone, in&s;tead of employing them&s;elves in the religious exerci&s;es &s;uitable to their condition, they began to reproach the Father Guar|dian, and four of the &s;enior monks, who had been mo&s;t active in &s;educing them, for their inordinate ambition, which had brought &s;uch mi&s;ery on them, and &s;uch di&s;grace upon their order. From reproaches they proceeded to cur&s;es and exercrations, and at la&s;t in a frenzy of rage and di&s;pair, they fell upon them with &s;uch violence, that they murdered the Father Guardi|an on the &s;pot, and &s;o di&s;abled the other four, that it became nece&s;&s;ary to carry them next morning in a cart, together with the dead body of the Father Guar|dian to the place of execution.

He had not only per&s;uaded his mi&s;tre&s;s, the Queen of England, to enter warmly into his &s;enti|ments and to offer her mediation to the contending powers, but had prevailed both on the Emperor and King of France to &s;end their plenipotentiaries to a vil|lage between Gravelines and Ardres.

<P>DURING the&s;e tran&s;actions in other parts of Eu|rope, Germany enjoyed &s;uch profound tranquillity, as afforded the diet full lei&s;ure to deliberate, and to e&s;ta|bli&s;h proper regulations concerning a point of the greate&s;t con&s;equence to the internal peace of the Em|pire. By the treaty of Pa&s;&s;au in one thou&s;and five hundred and fifty-two, it had been referred to the next diet of the Empire to confirm and perfect the plan of religious pacification, which was there agreed upon.

<P>BUT as a diet was now nece&s;&s;ary on many accounts, Ferdinand about the beginning of this year had re|paired to Aug&s;burg. Though few of the Princes were pre&s;ent either in per&s;on or by their deputies, he opened the a&s;&s;embly by a &s;peech, in which he propo&s;ed the termination of the di&s;&s;entions, to which the new tenets and controver&s;ies with regard to religion had given ri&s;e, not only as the fir&s;t and great bu&s;ine&s;s of the diet, but as the point which both the Emperor and he had mo&s;t at heart. He repre&s;ented the innu|merable ob&s;tacles which the Emperor had to &s;urmount before he could procure the convocation of a general council, as well as the fatal accidents which had for &s;ome time retarded, and had at la&s;t &s;u&s;pended the con&s;ultations of that a&s;&s;embly. He ob&s;erved that expe|rience had already taught them how vain it was to expect any remedy for evils, which demanded immediate re|dre&s;s, from a general council, the a&s;&s;embling of which would either be prevented, or its deliberations be in|terrupted by the di&s;&s;entions and ho&s;tilities of the Princes of Chri&s;tendom; That a national council in Germany, which, as &s;ome imagined, might be called with greater ea&s;e, and deliberate with more perfect &s;ecurity, was an a&s;&s;embly of an unprecedented nature, the juri&s;diction of which was uncertain in its extent, and the form of its proceedings undefined; That in his opinion there remained but one method for com|po&s;ing their unhappy differences, which though it had been often tried without &s;ucce&s;s, might yet prove effectual if it were attempted with a better and more pacific &s;pirit than had appeared on fomer occa&s;ions, and that was to choo&s;e a few men of learning, abilities and moderation, who by di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the di&s;puted articles in an amicable conference, might explain them in &s;uch a manner as to bring the contending parties either to unite in &s;entiment, or to differ with charity.</P>

of the Prote&s;tants; Ferdinand, they ob&s;erved with much &s;urprize, had not once mentioned, in his addre&s;s to the diet, the treaty of Pa&s;&s;au, the &s;tipula|tions in which they con&s;idered as the great &s;ecurity of their religious liberty. The &s;u&s;picions to which this gave ri&s;e were confirmed by the accounts which they daily received of the extreme rigor with which Fer|dinand treated their Prote&s;tant brethren in his heredi|tary dominions, and as it was natural to con&s;ider his actions as the &s;ure&s;t indication of his intentions, this dimini&s;hed their confidence in tho&s;e pompous profe&s;&s;i|ons of moderation or of zeal for the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of concord, to which his practice was &s;o utterly repug|nant.</P>
<P>THE arrival of the Cardinal Morone, whom the Pope had appointed to attend the diet as his nuncio, compleated their conviction, and left them no room to doubt that &s;ome dangerous machination was form|ing again&s;t the peace or &s;afety of the Prote&s;tant church. Julius elated with the unexpected return of the En|gli&s;h nation from apo&s;tacy, began to flatter him&s;elf that the &s;pirit of mutiny and revolt having now &s;pent its force, the happy period was come when the church might re&s;ume its ancient authority, and he obeyed by the people with the &s;ame tame &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion as for|merly. Full of the&s;e hopes, he had &s;ent Morone to Aug&s;burg with in&s;tructions to employ his eloquence in order to excite the Germans to imitate the laudable example of the Engli&s;h, and his political addre&s;s in order to prevent any decree of the diet to the detri|ment of the catholick faith. As Morone inherited from his father, the chancellor of Milan, uncommon talents for negociation and intrigue, he could &s;carce have failed of embarra&s;&s;ing the mea&s;ures of the Pro|te&s;tants in the diet or of defeating whatever they aimed at obtaining in it for their farther &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>BUT an unfore&s;een event delivered them from all the danger which they had rea&s;on to apprehend from Morone's pre&s;ence. Julius, by abandoning him&s;elf to plea&s;ures and amu&s;ements no le&s;s unbecoming his age than his character, having contracted &s;uch habits of di&s;&s;ipation, that any &s;erious occupation, e&s;pecially if

attended with difficulty, became an intolerable bur|den to him, had long re&s;i&s;ted the &s;ollicitations of his nephew to hold a con&s;i&s;tory, becau&s;e he expected there a violent oppo&s;ition to his &s;chemes in favour of that young man. But when all the pretexts which he could invent for eluding his reque&s;t were exhau&s;ted, and at the &s;ame time his indolent aver&s;ion to bu&s;ine&s;s continued to grow upon him, he feigned indi&s;po&s;iti|on rather than yield to his nephew's importunity; and that he might give the deceit a greater colour of probability, he not only confined him&s;elf to his apart|ment, but changed his u&s;ual diet and manner of life. By per&s;i&s;ting too long in acting this ridiculous part, he contracted a real di&s;ea&s;e, of which he died in a few days, leaving his infamous minion the Cardinal de Monte to bear his name, and to di&s;grace the dignity which he had conferred upon him <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Onuphr. Panvinius de vitis Pontificum. p. 320. Thuan. lib. xv. 517.</NOTE>. As &s;oon as Mo|rone heard of his death, he &s;et out abruptly from Aug&s;burg, where he had re&s;ided only a few days, that he might be pre&s;ent at the election of a new Pontiff.</P>
<P>ONE cau&s;e of their &s;u&s;picions and fears being thus re|moved, the Prote&s;tants &s;oon became &s;en&s;ible that their conjectures concerning Ferdinand's intentions, how plau&s;ible &s;oever, were ill-founded, and that he had no thoughts of violating the articles favourable to them in the treaty of Pa&s;&s;au. Charles, from the time that Maurice had defeated all his &s;chemes in the Empire, and overturned the great &s;y&s;tem of religious and civil de&s;poti&s;m, which he had almo&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed there, gave little attention to the internal government of Germa|ny, and permitted his brother to pur&s;ue whatever mea&s;ures he judged mo&s;t &s;alutary and expedient. Fer|dinand, le&s;s ambitious and enterprizing than the Em|peror, in&s;tead of re&s;uming a plan, which he, with power and re&s;ources &s;o far &s;uperior, had failed of ac|compli&s;hing, endeavoured to attach the Princes of the Empire to his family by an admini&s;tration uniform|ly moderate and equitable. To this he gave, at pre|&s;ent, particular attention, becau&s;e his &s;ituation at this juncture rendered it nece&s;&s;ary to court their favour and &s;upport with more than u&s;ual a&s;&s;iduity.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="011837_1085_0F9D89365719F890">CHARLES had again re&s;umed his favourite project of acquiring the Imperial crown for his &s;on Philip, which the ill-reception it had met with when fir&s;t pro|po&s;ed had obliged him to intermit, but had not per|&s;uaded him to relinqui&s;h. This led him warmly to renew his reque&s;ts to his brother that he would accept of &s;ome compen&s;ation for his prior right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and &s;acrifice that to the grandeur of the hou&s;e of Au|&s;tria. Ferdinand who was as little di&s;po&s;ed, as for|merly, to give &s;uch an extraordinary proof of &s;elf-denial, being &s;en&s;ible that, in order to defeat this &s;cheme, not only the mo&s;t inflexible firmne&s;s on his part, but a vi|gorous declaration from the Princes of the Empire in behalf of his title, were requi&s;ite; was willing to pur|cha&s;e their favour by gratifying them in every point that they deemed intere&s;ting or e&s;&s;ential.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, the Turks, after having wre&s;t|ed from him great part of his Hungarian territories, were ready to attack the provinces &s;till &s;ubject to his authority with a formidable army, again&s;t which he could bring no equal force into the field, unle&s;s the diet &s;hould grant him immediate and extraordinary aid. For this he could not hope if the internal peace of the empire were not e&s;tabli&s;hed on a foundation &s;o|lid in it&s;elf, and which &s;hould appear, even to the Prote&s;tants, &s;o &s;ecure and &s;o permanent, as might not only allow them to engage in a di&s;tant war with &s;afety, but encourage them to act with vigour.</P>
<P>A STEP taken by the Prote&s;tants them&s;elves, a &s;hort time after the opening of the diet, rendered him &s;till more cautious of giving them any new cau&s;e of offence. As &s;oon as the publication of Ferdinand's &s;peech created the fears and &s;u&s;picions which have been mentioned, the Electors of Saxony and Branden|burgh, together with the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e, met at Naumburgh, and renewing the ancient treaty of con|fraternity which had long united their families, they added to it a new article, by which the contracting parties bound them&s;elves to adhere to the confe&s;&s;ion of Aug&s;burgh, and to maintain the doctrine which it contained in their re&s;pective dominions <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Chytrai Saxonia, 480.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="011837_1086_0F9D8936F23495B8">FERDINAND, influenced by all the&s;e con&s;iderations, employed his utmo&s;t addre&s;s in conducting the delibe|rations of the diet &s;o as not to excite the jealou&s;y of a party on who&s;e friend&s;hip he depended, and who&s;e enmity, as they had not only taken the alarm, but had begun to prepare for their defence, he had &s;o much rea&s;on to dread. The members of the diet readily agreed to Ferdinand's propo&s;al of taking the &s;tate of religion into con&s;ideration, previous to any other bu|&s;ine&s;s. But, as &s;oon as they entered upon it, both parties di&s;covered all the zeal and animo&s;ity which a &s;ubject &s;o intere&s;ting naturally engenders, and which the rancour of controver&s;y, together with the vio|lence of civil war, had inflamed to the highe&s;t pitch.</P>
<P>THE Prote&s;tants contended that the &s;ecurity which they claimed in con&s;equence of the treaty of Pa&s;&s;au &s;hould extend, without limitation, to all who had hitherto embraced the doctrine of Luther, or who &s;hould here after embrace it. The Catholics, having fir&s;t of all a&s;&s;erted the Pope's right as the &s;upreme and final judge with re&s;pect to all articles of faith, in&s;i&s;ted that the toleration granted, by the treaty of Pa&s;&s;au, to &s;uch as had adopted the new opinions; which on account of the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of the Empire, and for the &s;ake of peace, they were willing to confirm; &s;hould not be extended either to tho&s;e cities which had con|formed to the Interim, or to &s;uch eccle&s;ia&s;tics as &s;hould for the future apo&s;tatize from the church of Rome. It was no ea&s;y matter to reconcile &s;uch oppo|&s;ite preten&s;ions, which were &s;upported, on each &s;ide, by the mo&s;t elaborate arguments, and the greate&s;t acri|mony of expre&s;&s;ion, that the abilities or zeal of theo|logians long exerci&s;ed in di&s;putation could &s;ugge&s;t. Ferdinand, however, by his addre&s;s and per&s;everance; by &s;oftening &s;ome things on each &s;ide; by putting a favourable meaning upon others; by repre&s;enting in|ce&s;&s;antly the nece&s;&s;ity as well as the advantages of con|cord; and by threatening on &s;ome occa&s;ions, when all other con&s;iderations were di&s;regarded, to di&s;&s;olve the di|et, brought them at length to a conclu&s;ion in which they all agreed.</P>

<P>SUCH are the capital articles in this famous Rece&s;s, which is the ba&s;is of religious peace in Germany, and the bond of union among its various &s;tates, the &s;enti|ments of which are &s;o extremely different with re&s;pect to points the mo&s;t intere&s;ting and important. In our age and nation, to which the idea of Toleration is familiar, and its beneficial effects well known, it may

&s;eem &s;trange that a method of terminating their di&s;|&s;entions, &s;o &s;uitable to the mind and charitable &s;pirit of the Chri&s;tian religion, did not &s;ooner occur to the contending parties. But an expedient, which, how &s;alutary &s;oever it might be, was repugnant to the &s;en|timents and practice of Chri&s;tians during many ages, did not lie obvious to di&s;covery. Among the ancient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nens, all who&s;e deities were local and tute<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ver&s;ity of &s;entiment concerning the object or rights of religious wor&s;hip &s;eems to have been no &s;ource of animo&s;ity, becau&s;e the acknowledging veneration to be due to any one God, did not apply denial of the exi&s;tence or the power of any other God; nor were the modes and rites of wor&s;hip e&s;tabli&s;hed in one country incompatible with tho&s;e which other nations approved of and ob&s;erved. Thus the errors in their &s;y&s;tem of theology were of &s;uch a nature as to be pro|ductive of concord, and notwith&s;tanding the amaz|ing number of their deities, as well as the infinite va|riety of their ceremonies, a &s;ociable and tolerating &s;pi|rit &s;ub&s;i&s;ted almo&s;t univer&s;ally in the pagan world.</P>
<P>BUT when the Chri&s;tian revelation declared one Supreme Being to be the &s;ole object of religions vene|ration, pre&s;cribed the form of wor&s;hip mo&s;t acceptable to him, whoever admitted the truth it held, of con&s;e|quence, every other mode of religion to be ab&s;urd and impious. Hence the zeal of the fir&s;t converts to the Chri&s;tian faith in propagating its doctrines, and the ardour with which they laboured to overturn every other form of wor&s;hip. They employed, however, for this purpo&s;e no methods but &s;uch as &s;uited the na|ture of religion. By the force of powerful arguments, they convinced the under&s;tandings of men; by the charms of &s;uperior virtue, they allured and captivat|ed their hearts. At length the civil power declared in favour of Chri&s;tianity, and though numbers, imitat|ing the example of their &s;uperiors, crouded into the church, many &s;till adhered to their ancient &s;uper&s;titi|ons. Enraged at their ob&s;tinacy, the mini&s;ters of reli|gion, who&s;e zeal was &s;till unabated, though their &s;anc|tity and virtue were much dimini&s;hed, forgot &s;o far the nature of their own mi&s;&s;ion, and of the arguments
<PB N="251" REF="011837_1089_0F9D893932118CF8">
which they ought to have employed, that they armed the Imperial power again&s;t the&s;e unhappy men, and as they could not per&s;uade, they tried to compel them to believe.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time, controver&s;ies concerning arti|cles of faith multiplied, from various cau&s;es, among chri&s;tians them&s;elves, and the &s;ame unhallowed wea|pons which had fir&s;t been u&s;ed again&s;t the enemies of their religon, were turned again&s;t each other. Every zealous di&s;putant endeavoured to intere&s;t the civil magi&s;trates in his cau&s;e, and each in his turn employed the &s;ecular arm to cru&s;h or to exter|minate his opponents. Not long after, the bi&s;hops of Rome put in their claim to infallibility in explaining articles of faith, and deciding points in controver&s;y, and bold as the preten&s;ion was, they by their artifi|ces and per&s;everance, impo&s;ed on the credulity of mankind, and brought them to recognize it. To doubt or to deny any doctrine to which the&s;e unerring in&s;tructors had given the &s;anction of their approbation, was held to be not only a re&s;i&s;ting of truth, but an act of rebellion again&s;t their &s;acred authority; and the &s;eculiar power, of which by various arts they had ac|quired the ab&s;olute direction, was in&s;tantly employed to avenge both.</P>
<P>THUS Europe had been accu&s;tomed, during many centuries, to &s;ee &s;peculative opinions propagated or defended by force; the charity and mutual forbear|ance which Chri&s;tianity recommends with &s;o much warmth were forgotten, the &s;acred rights of con&s;cience and of private judgment were unheard of, and not on|ly the idea of toleration, but even the word it&s;elf, in in the &s;en&s;e now affixed to it was unknown. A right to extirpate error by force was univer&s;ally allowed to be the prerogative of tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the know|ledge of truth, and as each party of Chri&s;tians believ|ed that they had got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this invaluable at|tainment, they all claimed and exerci&s;ed, as far as they were able, the rights which it was &s;uppo&s;ed to convey. The Roman catholics, as their &s;y&s;tem re&s;ted on the deci&s;ions of an infallible judge, never doubted that truth was on their &s;ide, and openly called on the
<PB N="252" REF="011837_1090_0F9D8939F320AB38">
civil power to repel the impious and heretical innova|tors who had ri&s;en up again&s;t it. The Prote&s;tants, no le&s;s confident that their doctrine was well founded, re|quired with equal ardour, the Princes of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> party to check &s;uch as pre&s;umed to impugn or to oppo&s;e it. Luther, Calvin, Cranmer, Knox, the founders of the reformed church in their re&s;pective coun|tries, inflicted, as far as they had power and op|portunity, the &s;ame puni&s;hments which were denoun|ced again&s;t their own di&s;ciples by the church of Rome, on &s;uch as called in que&s;tion any article in their creeds. To their followers, and perhaps to their opponents, it would have appeared a &s;ymptom of diffidence in the goodne&s;s of their cau&s;e, or an acknowledgment that it was not well founded, if they had not employed in its defence all tho&s;e means which it was &s;uppo&s;ed truth had a right to employ.</P>
<P>IT was towards the clo&s;e of the &s;eventeenth centu|ry, before toleration, under its pre&s;ent form, was ad|mitted fir&s;t into the republic of the United Provinces, and from thence introduced into England. Long ex|perience of the calamities of mutual per&s;ecution, the influence of free government, the light and humanity acquired by the progre&s;s of &s;cience, together with the prudence and authority of the civil magi&s;trate, were all requi&s;ite in order to e&s;tabli&s;h a regulation &s;o re|pugnant to the ideas which all the different &s;ects had adopted from mi&s;taken conceptions concerning the nature of religion and the rights of truth, or which all of them had derived from the er|roneous maxims e&s;tabli&s;hed by the church of Rome.</P>
<P>THE rece&s;s of Aug&s;burg, it is evident, was found|ed on no &s;uch liberal and enlarged &s;entiments con|cerning freedom of religious enquiry or the nature of toleration. It was nothing more than a &s;cheme of pa|cification, which political con&s;iderations alone had &s;ug|ge&s;ted to the contending parties, and regard for their mutual tranquillity and &s;afety had rendered nece&s;&s;ary. Of this there can be no &s;tronger proof than an article in the rece&s;s it&s;elf, by which the benefits of the paci|fication are declared to extend only to the Catholicks on the one &s;ide, and to &s;uch as adhered to the Con|fe&s;&s;ion
<PB N="253" REF="011837_1091_0F9D893AB79CA9F0">
of Aug&s;burg on the other. The followers of Zuinglius and Calvin remained, in con&s;equence of that exclu&s;ion, without any protection from the rigour of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">aws denounced again&s;t heretics. Nor did they ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ain any legal &s;ecurity, until the treaty of We&s;tpha|lia, near a century after this period, provided that they &s;hould be admitted to enjoy, in as ample manner as the Lutherans, all the advantages and protection which the rece&s;s of Aug&s;burg affords.</P>
<P>BUT if the followers of Luther were highly plea&s;ed with the &s;ecurity which they acquired by this rece&s;s, &s;uch as adhered to the ancient &s;y&s;tem had no le&s;s rea|&s;on to be &s;atisfied with that article in it which pre&s;erv|ed entire to the Roman catholick church the benefices of &s;uch eccle&s;ia&s;ticks as &s;hould hereafter renounce its doctrines. This article, known in Germany by the name of the <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Re&s;ervation,</HI> was manife&s;tly &s;o conformable to the idea and to the rights of an e&s;ta|bli&s;hed church; and it appeared &s;o equitable to prevent revenues, which had been originally appropriated for the maintenance of per&s;ons attached to acertain &s;y&s;tem, from being alienated to any other purpo&s;e, that the prote&s;tants, though they fore&s;aw its con&s;equences, were obliged to relinqui&s;h their oppo&s;ition to it. As the Roman catholick Princes of the Empire have tak|en care to &s;ee this article exactly ob&s;erved in every ca&s;e where there was an opportunity of putting it in execution, it has proved the great barrier of the Rom|i&s;h church in Germany again&s;t the Reformation; and as from this period the &s;ame temptation of intere&s;t did not allure eccle&s;ia&s;ticks to relinqui&s;h the e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;y&s;tem, there have been few of that order, who have loved truth with &s;uch di&s;intere&s;ted and ardent affecti|on, as to abandon for its &s;ake the rich benefices which they had in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>DURING the &s;itting of the diet, Marcellus Cervi|no, Cardinal of Santa Croce, was elected Pope in room of Julius. He, in imitation of Adrian, did not change his name on being exalted to the Papal Chair. As he equalled that Pontiff in purity of intention, and excelled him much in the arts of government, and &s;till more in knowledge of the &s;tate and genius of the

papal court; as he had capacity to di&s;cern what refor|mation it needed, as well as what it could bear, &s;uch regulations were expected from his virtue and wi&s;|dom, as would have removed many of its gro&s;&s;|e&s;t and mo&s;t flagrant corruptions, and have contribu|ted towards reconciling to the church, &s;uch as from indignation at the&s;e enormities had abandoned its communion. But this excellent Pontiff was only &s;hewn to the church and immediately &s;natched away. The confinement in the conclave had impaired his health, and the fatigue of tedious ceremonies upon his acce&s;&s;ion, together with too inten&s;e and anxious application of mind to the &s;chemes of improvement which he meditated, exhau&s;ted &s;o entirely the vigour of his feeble con&s;titution, that he &s;ickened on the twelfth, and died on the twentieth day after his electi|on<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Thuan. 520.

<P>ALL the refinements in artifice and intrigue, pecu|liar to conclaves, were di&s;played in that which was held for electing a &s;ucce&s;&s;or to Marcellus; the Cardi|nals of the Imperial and French factions labouring, with equal ardour, to gain the nece&s;&s;ary number of &s;uffrages for one of their own party. But, after a &s;truggle of no long duration, though conducted with all the warmth and eagerne&s;s natural to men contend|ing for &s;o great an object, they united in chu&s;ing John Peter Caraffa the elde&s;t member of the &s;acred college and the &s;on of Count Montorio, a nobleman of an il|lu&s;trious family in the kingdom of Naples. The ad|dre&s;s and influence of Cardinal Farne&s;e who favoured his preten&s;ions, Caraffa's own merit, and perhaps his great age, which &s;oothed all the di&s;appointed candi|dates with the nearer pro&s;pect of a new vacancy, con|curred in bringing about this &s;peedy union of &s;uffra|ges. In order to te&s;tify his re&s;pect for the memory of Paul III. by whom he had been created Cardinal, and his gratitude to the family of Farne&s;e, he a&s;&s;umed the name of Paul IV.</P>
<P>THE choice of a prelate of &s;uch a &s;ingular character, and who had long held a cour&s;e extremely different from that which u&s;ually led to the dignity now con|ferred

By means of this he not only acquired profound &s;kill in &s;chola&s;tick theology, but added to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t a con|&s;iderable knowledge of the learned languages and of polite literature, the &s;tudy of which had been lately revived in Italy, and was pur&s;ued at this time with great ardour. His mind, however, naturally gloo|my and &s;evere, was more formed to imbibe the four &s;pirit of the former, than to receive any degree of e|legance or liberality of &s;entiment from the latter; &s;o that he acquired rather the qualities and pa&s;&s;ions of a reclu&s;e eccle&s;ia&s;tick, than the talents nece&s;&s;ary for the conduct of great affairs. Accordingly, when he enter|ed into orders, although &s;everal rich benefices were be&s;towed on him, and he was early employed as nun|cio in different courts, he &s;oon became di&s;gu&s;ted with that cour&s;e of life, and langui&s;hed to be in a &s;ituation more &s;uited to his ta&s;te and temper. With this view he re&s;igned at once all his eccle&s;ia&s;tical preferments, and having in&s;tituted an order of regular prie&s;ts, whom he denominated Theatines, from the name of the archbi&s;hoprick which he had held, he a&s;&s;ociated him&s;elf as a member of their fraternity, conformed to all the rigorous rules to which he had &s;ubjected them, and preferred the &s;olitude of a mona&s;tick life, with the honour of being the founder of a new order, to all the va&s;t objects which the court of Rome pre&s;ented to his ambition.</P>
<P>IN this retreat he remained for many years, until Paul III. induced by the &s;ame of his &s;anctity and knowledge called him to Rome, in order to con&s;ult with him concerning the mea&s;ures which might be mo&s;t proper and effectual for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing of here|&s;y, and re-e&s;tabli&s;hing the ancient authority of the

church. Having thus allured him from his &s;olitude, the Pope, partly by his intreaties, and partly by his authority, prevailed on him to accept of a Cardinal's hat, to rea&s;&s;ume the benefices which he had re&s;igned, and to return again into the u&s;ual path of eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal ambition which he &s;eemed to have relinqui&s;hed. But, during two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Pontificates, under the fir&s;t of which the court of Rome was the mo&s;t artful and intere&s;ted, and under the &s;econd the mo&s;t di&s;&s;o|lute of any in Europe, Caraffa retained his mona&s;tic au&s;terity. He was an avowed and bitter enemy not only of all innovation in opinion, but of every irregu|larity in practice; he was the chief in&s;trument in e&s;ta|bli&s;hing the formidable and odious tribunal of the In|qui&s;ition in the papal territories; he appeared a vio|lent advocate on all occa&s;ions for the juri&s;diction and di&s;cipline of the church, and a &s;evere cen&s;urer of every mea&s;ure which &s;eemed to flow from motives of policy or intere&s;t, rather than from zeal for the honour of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical order, and the dignity of the Holy See. Under a prelate of &s;uch a character, the Roman cour|tiers expected a &s;evere and violent Pontificate, during which the principles of &s;ound policy would be &s;acrific|ed to the narrow prejudices of prie&s;tly zeal; while the people of Rome were apprehen&s;ive of &s;eeing the &s;or|did and forbidding rigour of mona&s;tick manners &s;ub|&s;tituted in place of the gaiety or magnificence to which they had long been accu&s;tomed in the papal court. The&s;e apprehen&s;ions Paul was extremely &s;olicitous to remove. At his fir&s;t entrance on the admini&s;tration he laid a&s;ide that au&s;terity which had hitherto di&s;tin|gui&s;hed his per&s;on and family, and when the ma&s;ter of his hou&s;hold inquired in what manner he would chu&s;e to live, he haughtily replied, "as becomes a great Prince." He ordered the ceremony of his coronation to be conducted with more than u&s;ual magnificence; and endeavoured to render him&s;elf popular by &s;everal acts of liberality and indulgence towards the inhabi|tants of Rome<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Platina, p. 327.

the conjectures of the courtiers, and the fears of the people, if he had not, immediately after his election, called to Rome two of his nephews, &s;ons of his brother the Count of Montorio. The elde&s;t he promoted to be governor of Rome, the younge&s;t who had hitherto &s;erved as a &s;oldier of fortune in the ar|mies of Spain or France, and who&s;e di&s;po&s;ition as well as manners were &s;till more foreign from the clerical character than his profe&s;&s;ion, he created a Cardinal, and appointed him legate of Bologna, the &s;econd of|fice in power and dignity which a Pope can be&s;tow. The&s;e marks of favour, no le&s;s &s;udden than extrava|gant, he accompanied with the mo&s;t unbounded con|fidence and attachment, and forgetting all his former &s;evere maxims, he &s;eemed to have no other object than the aggrandizing of his nephews. Their ambi|tion, unfortunately for Paul, was too a&s;piring to be &s;atisfied with any moderate acqui&s;ition. They had &s;een the family of Medici rai&s;ed by the intere&s;t of the Popes of that hou&s;e to &s;upreme power in Tu&s;cany; Paul III. had by his abilities and addre&s;s &s;ecured the dutchies of Parma and Platentia to the family of Far|ne&s;e. They aimed at &s;ome e&s;tabli&s;hment for them|&s;elves, no le&s;s con&s;iderable and independant; and as they could not expect that the Pope would carry his indulgence towards them &s;o far as to &s;ecularize any part of the patrimony of the church, they had no pro&s;|pect of attaining what they wi&s;hed, but by di&s;member|ing the Imperial dominions in Italy, in hopes of &s;eiz|ing &s;ome portion of them. This alone would have been to them a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for &s;owing the &s;eeds of di&s;cord between their uncle and the Emperor.</P>
<P>BUT Cardinal Caraffa, had, be&s;ides, private rea|&s;ons which filled him with hatred and enmity to the Emperor. While he &s;erved in the Spani&s;h troops he had not received &s;uch marks of honour and di&s;tincti|on as he thought due to his birth and merit. Di&s;|gu&s;ted with this ill-u&s;age, he had abruptly quit|ted the Imperial &s;ervice, and entering into that of France; he had not only met with &s;uch a reception as &s;oothed his vanity, and attached him to the French intere&s;t, but by contracting an intimate friend&s;hip
<PB N="258" REF="011837_1096_0F9D893E76E8F608">
with Strozzi, who commanded the French army in Tu&s;cany, he had imbibed a mortal antipathy to the Emperor as the great enemy to the liberty and inde|pendence of the Italian &s;tates. Nor was the Pope him|&s;elf indi&s;po&s;ed to receive impre&s;&s;ions unfavourable to the Emperor. The oppo&s;ition given to his election by the Cardinals of the Imperial faction left in his mind deep re&s;entment, which was heightened by the re|membrance of ancient injuries from Charles or his mi|ni&s;ters.</P>
<P>OF this his nephews took advantage, and employ|ed various devices, in order to exa&s;perate him beyond a po&s;&s;ibility of reconciliation. They aggravated every circum&s;tance which could be deemed any indication of the Emperor's di&s;&s;atisfaction with his promotion; they read to him an intercepted letter in which Charles taxed the Cardinals of his party with negligence or incapacity in not having defeated Paul's election: They pretended, at one time, to have di&s;covered a con&s;piracy formed by the Imperial mini&s;ter and Co&s;|mo de Medici again&s;t the Pope's life; they alarmed him, at another, with accounts of a plot for a&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nating them&s;elves. By the&s;e artifices, they kept his mind, which was naturally violent and become &s;u&s;pi|cious from old age, in &s;uch perpetual agitation, as precipitated him into mea&s;ures, which otherwi&s;e he would have been the fir&s;t per&s;on to condemn<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ripamontii Hi&s;t.

He &s;eized &s;ome of the Cardinals who were mo&s;t attached to the Emperor, and confined them in the ca&s;tle of St. Angelo; he per&s;ecuted the Colonnas and other Roman barons, the antient retainers to the Imperial faction, with the utmo&s;t &s;everity; and di&s;covering on all occa&s;ions his di&s;tru&s;t, fear, or hatred of the Em|peror, he began at la&s;t to court the friend&s;hip of the French King, and &s;eemed willing to throw him&s;elf ab&s;olutely upon him for &s;upport and protection.</P>
<P>THIS was the very point to which his nephews wi&s;hed to bring him as mo&s;t favourable to their ambi|tious &s;chemes; and as the accompli&s;hment of the&s;e de|pended on their uncle's life, who&s;e advanced age did

not admit of lo&s;ing a moment unnece&s;&s;arily in negoti|ations, in&s;tead of treating at &s;econd hand with the French amba&s;&s;ador at Rome, they prevailed on the Pope to di&s;patch a per&s;on of confidence directly to the court of France, with &s;uch overtures on his part as they hoped would not be rejected. He propo&s;ed an alliance offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive between Henry and the Pope; that they &s;hould attack the dutchy of Tu&s;|cany and the kingdom of Naples with their united forces; and if their arms &s;hould prove &s;ucce&s;sful, that the ancient republican form of government &s;hould be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in the former, and the inve&s;titure of the latter &s;hould be granted to one of the French King's &s;ons, after re&s;erving a certain territory which &s;hould be annexed to the patrimony of the church, together with an independent and princely e&s;tabli&s;hment for each of the Pope's nephews.</P>
<P>THE King, allured by the&s;e &s;pecious projects, gave a mo&s;t favourable audience to the envoy. But when the matter was propo&s;ed in council, the con&s;table Montmorency, who&s;e natural caution and aver&s;ion to daring enterprizes increa&s;ed with age and experience, remon&s;trated with great vehemence again&s;t the alliance. He put Henry in mind how fatal every expedition in|to Italy had been to France during three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive reigns, and if &s;uch an enterprize had proved too great for the nation even when its &s;trength and finances were entire, there was no rea&s;on to hope for &s;ucce&s;s, if it &s;hould be attempted now when both were exhau&s;t|ed by extraordinary efforts during wars, which had la&s;ted, with little interruption, almo&s;t half a century. He repre&s;ented the manife&s;t imprudence of entering into engagements with a Pope of four&s;core, as any &s;y&s;tem which re&s;ted on no better foundation than his life mu&s;t be extremely precarious, and upon the event of his death, which could not be di&s;tant, the face of things together with the inclination of the Ita|lian States mu&s;t in&s;tantly change, and the whole weight of the war be left upon the King alone. To the&s;e con&s;iderations he added the near pro&s;pect which they now had of a final accommodation with the Em|peror who having taken the re&s;olution of retiring from

the world, wi&s;hed to tran&s;mit his kingdoms in peace to his &s;on; and he concluded with repre&s;enting the ab&s;olute certainty of drawing the arms of England up|on France, if it &s;hould appear that the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of tranquillity in Europe was prevented by the ambiti|on of its Monarch.</P>
<P>THESE arguments, weighty in them&s;elves, and urged by a mini&s;ter of great authority, would proba|bly have determined the King to decline any connecti|on with the Pope. But the Duke of Gui&s;e and his bro|ther the Cardinal of Lorrain, who delighted no le&s;s in hold and dangerous undertakings than Montmorency &s;hunned them, declared warmly for an alliance with the Pope. The Cardinal expected to be entru&s;ted with the conduct of the negociations in the court of Rome to which this alliance would give ri&s;e; the duke laid his account with obtaining the command of the army which would be appointed to invade Naples; and con&s;idering them&s;elves as already in the&s;e &s;tations, va&s;t projects opened to their a&s;piring and unbounded ambition. Their credit, together with the influence of the King's mi&s;tre&s;s, the famous Diana of Poitiers, who was, at that time entirely devoted to the intere&s;t of the family of Gui&s;e, more than counterbalanced all Montmorency's prudent remon&s;trances, and prevailed on an incon&s;iderate Prince to li&s;ten to the overtures of the Pope's envoy.</P>
<P>THE Cardinal of Lorrain, as he had expected, was immediately &s;ent to Rome with full powers to con|clude the treaty, and to concert mea&s;ures for carry|ing it into execution. Meanwhile, the Pope, either from reflecting on the danger and uncertain i&s;&s;ue of all military operations, or through the addre&s;s of the Imperial amba&s;&s;ador who had been at great pains to &s;ooth him, had not only begun to lo&s;e much of the ar|dour with which he had &s;et on foot the negociation with France, but even di&s;covered great unwillingne&s;s to continue it. In order to rou&s;e him from this fit of de&s;pondency, and to rekindle his former rage, his nephews had recour&s;e to the arts which they had al|ready practi&s;ed with &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s. They alarmed him with new repre&s;entations of the Emperor's ho&s;tile
<PB N="261" REF="011837_1099_0F9D8940AE701790">
intentions, with fre&s;h accounts which they had receiv|ed of threats uttered again&s;t him by the Imperial mini&s;|ters, and with new di&s;coveries which they pretended to have made of con&s;piracies formed, and ju&s;t ready to take effect again&s;t his life.</P>
<P>BUT the&s;e artifices, having been formerly tried, would not have operated a &s;econd time with the &s;ame force, nor have made the impre&s;&s;ion which they wi&s;h|ed, if Paul had not been excited by an offence of that kind which he was lea&s;t able to bear. He received ad|vice of the rece&s;s of the diet of Aug&s;burg, and of the toleration which was thereby granted to the Pro|te&s;tants, and this threw him at once into &s;uch tran&s;|ports of pa&s;&s;ion again&s;t the Emperor and King of the Romans, as carried him headlong into all the violent mea&s;ures, of his nephews. Full of high ideas with re|&s;pect to the papal prerogative, and animated with the fierce&s;t zeal again&s;t here&s;y, he con&s;idered the liberty of deciding concerning religious matters, which had been a&s;&s;umed by an a&s;&s;embly compo&s;ed partly of lay|men, as a pre&s;umptuous and unpardonable encroach|ment on that juri&s;diction which belonged to him alone; and regarded the indulgence which had been given to the Prote&s;tants as an impious act of that power which the diet had u&s;urped. He complained loudly of both to the Imperial amba&s;&s;ador. He in&s;i&s;ted that the re|ce&s;s of the diet &s;hould immediately be declared illegal and void. He threatened the Emperor and King of the Romans, in ca&s;e they &s;hould either refu&s;e or delay to gratify him in this particular, with the &s;evere&s;t effects of his vengeance. He talked in a tone of au|thority and command which might have &s;uited a pon|tiff of the twelfth century, when a papal decree was &s;ufficient to have &s;haken or to have overturned the throne of the greate&s;t Monarch, but which was alto|gether improper in that age, e&s;pecially when addre&s;&s;ed to the mini&s;ter of a Prince who had &s;o often made Pontiffs more formidable feel the weight of his power. The amba&s;&s;ador, however, heard all his extravagant propo&s;itions and menaces, with much patience, and endeavoured to &s;ooth him by putting him in mind of the extreme di&s;tre&s;s to which the Emperor was redu|ced
<PB N="262" REF="011837_1100_0F9D894172777AB8">
at In&s;pruck, of the engagements which he had come under to the Prote&s;tants in order to extricate him&s;elf, of the nece&s;&s;ity of fulfilling the&s;e, and of ac|commodating his conduct to the &s;ituation of his af|fairs. But weighty as the&s;e con&s;iderations were, they made no impre&s;&s;ion on the mind of the haughty and bigotted pontiff, who in&s;tantly replied, that he would ab&s;olve him by his apo&s;tolick authority from the obli|gation of the&s;e engagements, and even command him not to perform them; that in carrying on the cau&s;e of God and of the church, no regard ought to be had to the maxims of wordly prudence and policy, and that the ill &s;ucce&s;s of the Emperor's &s;chemes in Germany might ju&s;tly be deemed a mark of the divine di&s;plea|&s;ure again&s;t him, on account of his having paid little attention to the former, while he regulated his con|duct entirely by the latter. Having &s;aid this, he turn|ed from the amba&s;&s;ador abruptly without waiting for a reply.</P>
<P>HIS nephews took care to applaud and cheri&s;h the&s;e &s;entiments, and ea&s;ily wrought up his arrogant mind, fraught with all the monki&s;h ideas concerning the extent of the papal &s;upremacy, to &s;uch a pitch of re&s;entment again&s;t the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, and to &s;uch an high opinion of his own power, that he talked con|tinually of his being the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of tho&s;e who had depo&s;ed Kings and Emperors; that he was exalted as head over them all, and would trample &s;uch as op|po&s;ed him under his feet. In this di&s;po&s;ition, the car|dinal of Lorrain found the Pope, and ea&s;ily per&s;uad|ed him to &s;ign a treaty, which had for its object, the ruin of a Prince again&s;t whom he was &s;o highly exa&s;|perated. The &s;tipulations in the treaty were much the &s;ame as had been propo&s;ed by the Pope's envoy at Paris; and it was agreed to keep the whole tran&s;action &s;ecret until their united forces &s;hould be ready to take the field <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Pallav. lib. 13. p. 163.

<P>DURING the negociation of this treaty at Rome and Paris, an event happened which &s;eemed to render the fears which had given ri&s;e to it vain, and the operati|ons
<PB N="263" REF="011837_1101_0F9D8942D585A0D8">
which were to follow upon it unnece&s;&s;ary. This was the Emperor's re&s;ignation of his hereditary domi|nions to his &s;on Philip; together with his re&s;olution to withdraw entirely from any concern in bu&s;ine&s;s or the affairs of this world, in order that he might &s;pend the remainder of his days in retirement and &s;olitude. Though it requires neither deep reflection nor extra|ordinary di&s;cernment to di&s;cover that the &s;tate of roy|alty is not exempt from cares and di&s;appointment; though mo&s;t of tho&s;e who are exalted to a throne find &s;olicitude, and &s;atiety, and di&s;gu&s;t to be their perpe|tual attendants in that envied pre-eminence; yet, to de&s;cend voluntarily from the &s;upreme to a &s;ubordi|nate &s;tation, and to relinqui&s;h the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of pow|er in order to attain the enjoyment of happine&s;s, &s;eems to be an effort too great for the human mind. Several in&s;tances, indeed, occur in hi&s;tory of Monarchs who have quitted a throne, and have ended their days in retirement. But they were either weak Princes who took this re&s;olution ra&s;hly, and repented of it as &s;oon as it was taken; or unfortunate Princes from who&s;e hands &s;ome &s;trong rival had wre&s;ted their &s;ceptre, and compelled them to de&s;cend with reluctance into a pri|vate &s;tation. Diocle&s;ian is perhaps the only Prince capable of holding the reins of government, who ever re&s;igned them from deliberate choice, and who conti|nued during many years to enjoy the tranquillity of retirement without fetching one penitent &s;igh, or ca&s;t|ing back one look of de&s;ire, towards the power or dignity which he had abandoned.</P>
<P>NO wonder, then, that Charles's re&s;ignation &s;hould fill all Europe with a&s;toni&s;hment, and give ri&s;e, both among his contemporaries, and among the hi&s;|torians of that period, to various conjectures con|cerning the motives, which determined a Prince, who&s;e ruling pa&s;&s;ion had been uniformly the love of power, at the age of fifty-&s;ix, when objects of ambi|tion operate with full force on the mind, and are pur&s;ued with the greate&s;t ardour, to take a re&s;olution &s;o &s;ingular and unexpected. But while many authors have imputed it to motives &s;o frivolous and fanta&s;tical, as can hardly be &s;uppo&s;ed to influence any rea&s;onable

mind; while others have imagined it to be the re&s;ult of &s;ome profound &s;cheme of policy; hi&s;torians more inteligent, and better informed, neither a&s;cribe it to caprice, nor &s;earch for my&s;terious &s;ecrets of &s;tate, where &s;imple and obvious cau&s;es will fully account for the Emperor's conduct. Charles had been attacked early in life with the gout, and notwith&s;tanding all the precautions of the mo&s;t &s;kilful phy&s;icians in his time, the violence of the di&s;temper encrea&s;ed as he advanced in age, and the fits became every year more frequent, as well as more intolerable. Not only was the vigour of his con&s;titution broken, but the facul|ties of his mind were impared by the excruciating tor|ments which he endured. During the continuance of the fits, he was altogether incapable of applying to bu&s;ine&s;s, and even when they began to abate, as it was only at intervals that he could attend to what was &s;erious, he gave up the greate&s;t part of his time to trifling and even childi&s;h occupations, which &s;erved to relieve or to amu&s;e his mind, enfeebled and worn out with exce&s;s of pain. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, the conduct of &s;uch affairs as occurred, of cour&s;e, in governing &s;o many kingdoms was a burden more than &s;ufficient; but to pu&s;h forward and compleat the va&s;t &s;chemes, which the ambition of his more ac|tive years had formed, or to keep in view and carry on the &s;ame great &s;y&s;tem of policy, extending to every nation in Europe, and connected with the operations of every different court, were ta&s;ks, which far exceed|ed his &s;trength, and oppre&s;&s;ed and overwhelmed his mind. As he had been long accu&s;tomed to view the bu&s;ine&s;s of every department, whether civil, or mili|tary, or eccle&s;ia&s;tical, with his own eyes, and to de|cide concerning it according to his own ideas; it gave him the utmo&s;t pain, when he felt his infirmities encrea&s;e &s;o fa&s;t upon him, that he was obliged to com|mit the conduct of all affairs to his mini&s;ters. He im|puted every misfortune which befel him, and every mi&s;carriage that happened, even when the former was unavoidable, and the latter accidental, to his inability to take the in&s;pection of bu&s;ine&s;s him&s;elf. He com|plained of his hard fortune, in being oppo&s;ed, in his

Having thus grown old be|fore his time, he wi&s;ely judged it more decent to con|ceal his infirmities in &s;ome &s;olitude, than to expo&s;e them any longer to the publick eye; and prudently determined not to forfeit the fame, or lo&s;e the acqui|&s;itions of his better years, by &s;truggling, with a vain ob&s;tinacy, to retain the reins of government, when he was no longer able to hold them with &s;teadine&s;s, or to guide them with addre&s;s <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dom Leve&s;que in his memoirs of cardinal Granvelle gives a rea&s;on for the Emperor's re&s;ignation, which, as I recollect, is not mentioned by any other hi&s;torian. He &s;ays, that the Emperor having ceded the government of the kingdom of Naples and the dutchy of Milan to his &s;on, upon his mar|riage with the Queen of England; Philip, notwith&s;tanding the advice and entreaties of his father, removed all the mini&s;ters and officers in tho&s;e coun|tries, and appointed creatures of his own, to fill the places which they held. That he a&s;pired openly, and with little delicacy, to obtain a &s;hare in the ad|mini&s;tration of affairs, in the Low-Countries. That he endeavoured to thwart the Emperor's mea&s;ures, and to limit his authority, behaving to|wards him &s;ometimes with inattention, and &s;ometimes with haughtine&s;s. That Charles finding that he mu&s;t either yield to his &s;on, or openly contend with him, in order to avoid the&s;e, which were both di&s;agreeable and morti|fying to a father, he took the re&s;olution of re&s;igning his crowns, and of retir|ing from the world, vol. i. p. 24, &amp;c. Dom Leve&s;que derived his informa|tion concerning the&s;e curious facts, which he relates very briefly, from the original papers of cardinal Granvelle. But as that va&s;t collection of papers, one of the mo&s;t valuable hi&s;torical monuments of the &s;ixteenth century, and which could not fail of throwing much light on the tran&s;actions of Charles V. though pre&s;erved and arranged by M. L'Abb&eacute; Boizot of Be&s;ancon, is not publi&s;hed, I cannot determine what degree of credit &s;hould be given to this account of Charles's re&s;ignation. I have therefore taken no notice of it in relating this event.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT though Charles had revolved this &s;cheme in mind for &s;everal years, and had communicated it to his &s;i&s;ters the dowager Queens of France and Hunga|ry, who not only approved of his intention, but of|fered to accompany him to whatever place of retreat he &s;hould choo&s;e; &s;everal things had hitherto prevent|ed his carrying it into execution. He could not think of loading his &s;on with the government of &s;o many kingdoms, until he &s;hould attain &s;uch maturity of age, and of abilities, as would enable him to &s;u&s;tain that weighty burden; but as Philip had now reached his twenty-eighth year, and had been early accu&s;tomed
<PB N="266" REF="011837_1104_0F9D894472F4BD20">
to bu&s;ine&s;s, for which he di&s;covered both inclination and capacity, it can hardly be imputed to the partiality of paternal affection, that his &s;cruples with regard to this point, were entirely removed; and that he thought he might, without further he&s;itation or delay, place him on the throne which he was about to abandon. His mother's &s;ituation had been another ob&s;truction in his way. For although &s;he had continued almo&s;t fifty years in confinement, and under the &s;ame di&s;|order of mind which concern for her hu&s;band's death had brought upon her, yet the government of Spain, was &s;till ve&s;ted in her jointly with the Emperor; her name was in&s;erted together with his, in all the public writs i&s;&s;ued in that kingdom; and &s;uch was the fond attachment of the Spaniards to her, that they would probably have &s;crupled to recognize Philip as their &s;overeign, unle&s;s &s;he had con&s;ented to a&s;&s;ume him as her partner on the throne. Her utter incapacity for bu&s;ine&s;s rendered it impo&s;&s;ible to obtain this. But her death, which happened this year, removed this dif|ficulty; and as Charles, upon that event, became &s;ole Monarch of Spain, it left the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion open to his &s;on. The war with France had likewi&s;e been a rea&s;on for retaining the admini&s;tration of affairs in his own hand, as he was extremely &s;olicitous to have terminated it, that he might have given up his kingdoms to his &s;on in peace with all the world. But as Henry had di&s;|covered no di&s;po&s;ition to clo&s;e with any of his overtures, and had even rejected propo&s;als of peace, which were equal and moderate, in a tone, that &s;eemed to indicate a fixed purpo&s;e of continuing ho&s;tilities, he &s;aw that it was vain to wait longer in expectation of an event, which, how de&s;irable &s;oever, was altogether uncer|tain.</P>
<P>AS this, then, appeared to be the proper juncture for executing the &s;cheme which he had long me|ditated, Charles re&s;olved to re&s;ign his kingdoms to his &s;on, with a &s;olemnity, &s;uitable to the importance of the tran&s;action, and to perform this la&s;t act of &s;ove|reignty, with &s;uch formal pomp, as might leave a la&s;t|ing impre&s;&s;ion on the minds not only of his &s;ubjects but of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. With this view he called Philip

out of England, where the peevi&s;h temper of his Queen, which increa&s;ed with her de&s;pair of having i&s;&s;ue, renderd him extremely unhappy, and the jea|lou&s;y of the Engli&s;h left him no hopes of obtaining the direction of their affairs. Having a&s;&s;embled the &s;tates of the Low-Countries at Bru&s;&s;els, on the twenty-fifth of October, he &s;eated him&s;elf, for the la&s;t time, in the chair of &s;tate, on one &s;ide of which was placed his &s;on, and on the other his &s;i&s;ter the Queen of Hungary regent of the Netherlands, with a &s;plendid retinue of the grandees of Spain and princes of the Empire &s;tand|ing behind him. The pre&s;ident of the council of Flanders, by his command, explained in a few words his intention in calling this extraordinary meeting of the States. He then read the in&s;trument of re&s;igna|tion by which Charles &s;urrendered to his &s;on Philip all his territories, juri&s;diction, and authority in the Low-Countries, ab&s;olving his &s;ubjects there from their oath of allegiance to him, which he required them to trans|fer to Philip his lawful heir, and to &s;erve him with the &s;ame loyalty and zeal that they had manife&s;ted, during &s;o long a cour&s;e of years, in &s;upport of his go|vernment.</P>
<P>CHARLES then ro&s;e from his &s;eat, and leaning on the &s;houlder of the Prince of Orange, becau&s;e he was unable to &s;tand without &s;upport, he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the audience, and from a paper which he held in his hand, in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t his memory, he recounted, with dignity, but without o&s;tentation, all the great things which he had undertaken and performed &s;ince the commencement of his admini&s;tration. He ob&s;erved, that from the &s;eventeenth year of his age, he had de|dicated all his thoughts and attention to publick ob|jects, re&s;erving no portion of his time for the indul|gence of his ea&s;e, and very little for the enjoyment of private plea&s;ure; that either in a pacifick or ho&s;tile manner, he had vi&s;ited Germany nine times, Spain &s;ix times, France four times, Italy &s;even times, the Low-Countries ten times, England twice, Africa as often, and had made eleven voyages by &s;ea; that while his health permitted him to di&s;charge his duty, and the vigour of his con&s;titution was equal, in any
<PB N="268" REF="011837_1106_0F9D8945EF8D04F8">
degree, to the arduous office of governing &s;uch ex|ten&s;ive dominions, he had never &s;hunned labour, nor repined under fatigue; that now when his health was broken, and his vigour exhau&s;ted by the rage of an incurable di&s;temper, his growing infirmities admo|ni&s;hed him to retire, nor was he &s;o fond of reigning, as to retain the &s;ceptre in an impotent hand, which was no longer able to protect his &s;ubjects, or to render them happy; that in&s;tead of a &s;overeign worn out with di&s;ea&s;es, and &s;carce half alive, he gave them one in the prime of life, accu&s;tomed already to govern, and who added to the vigour of youth all the attenti|on and &s;agacity of maturer years; that, if during the cour&s;e of a long admini&s;tration, he had committed any material error in government, or if under the pre&s;&s;ure and amid&s;t the attention which he had been obliged to give &s;o many and great affairs, he had either neglected or injured any of his &s;ubjects, he now im|plored their forgivene&s;s; that for his part; he &s;hould ever retain a grateful &s;en&s;e of their fidelity and attach|ment, and would carry the remembrance of it along with him to the place of his retreat, as his &s;weete&s;t con&s;olation, as well as the be&s;t reward for all his &s;er|vices, and in his la&s;t prayers to Almighty God would pour forth his ardent wi&s;hes for their welfare.</P>
<P>THEN turning towards Philip, who fell on his knees and ki&s;&s;ed his father's hand, "If, &s;ays he, I had left you by my death this rich inheritance, to which I have made &s;uch large additions, &s;ome regard would have been ju&s;tly due to my memory on that account; but now when I voluntarily re&s;ign to you what I might have &s;till retained, I may well expect the warm|e&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of thanks on your part. With the&s;e, however, I di&s;pen&s;e, and &s;hall con&s;ider your concern for the welfare of your &s;ubjects, and your love of them, as the be&s;t and mo&s;t acceptable te&s;timony of your gra|titude to me. It is in your power, by a wi&s;e and vir|tuous admini&s;tration, to ju&s;tify the extraordinary proof which I give this day of my paternal affection, and to demon&s;trate that you are worthy of the confidence which I repo&s;e in you. Pre&s;erve an inviolable regard for religion; maintain the Catholick faith in its puri|ty;
<PB N="269" REF="011837_1107_0F9D8946AE799D10">
let the laws of your country be &s;acred in your eyes; encroach not on the rights and privileges of your people; and if the time &s;hall ever come, when you &s;hall wi&s;h to enjoy the tranquillity of private life, may you have a &s;on endowed with &s;uch qualities, that you can re&s;ign your &s;ceptre to him, with as much &s;a|tisfaction, as I give up mine to you."</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as Charles had fini&s;hed his long addre&s;s to his &s;ubjects and to their new &s;overeign, he &s;unk into the chair, exhau&s;ted and ready to faint with the fa|tigue of &s;uch an extraordinary effort. During his di&s;|cour&s;e, the whole audience melted into tears, &s;ome from admiration of his magnanimity, others &s;oftened by the expre&s;&s;ions of tenderne&s;s towards his &s;on, and of love to his people; and all were affected with the deepe&s;t &s;orrow at lo&s;ing a &s;overeign, who had di&s;tin|gui&s;hed the Netherlands, his native country, with particular marks of his regard and attachment.</P>
<P>PHILIP then aro&s;e from his knees, and after return|ing thanks to his father, with a low and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive voice, for the royal gift which his unexampled boun|ty had be&s;towed upon him, he addre&s;&s;ed the a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates, and regretting his inability to &s;peak the Flemi&s;h language with &s;uch facility as to expre&s;s what he felt on this intere&s;ting occa&s;ion, as well as what he owed to his good &s;ubjects in the Netherlands, he beg|ged that they would allow Granvelle bi&s;hop of Arras, to deliver what he had given him in charge to &s;peak in his name. Granvelle, in a long di&s;cour&s;e, expa|tiated on the zeal with which Philip was animated for the good of his &s;ubjects, on his re&s;olution to devote all his time and talents to the promoting of their hap|pine&s;s, and on his intention to imitate his father's ex|ample in di&s;tingui&s;hing the Netherlands with peculiar marks of his regard. Ma&euml;s, a lawyer of great elo|quence, replied, in name of the States, with large profe&s;&s;ions of their fidelity and affection to their new &s;overeign.</P>
<P>THEN Mary, Queen-dowager of Hungary, re&s;ign|ed the regency, with which &s;he had been entru&s;ted by her brother during the &s;pace of twenty-five years. Next day Philip, in pre&s;ence of the States, took the

<P>A FEW weeks thereafter, Charles, in an a&s;&s;embly no le&s;s &s;plendid, and with a ceremony equally pom|pous, re&s;igned to his &s;on the crowns of Spain, with all their territories depending on them, both in the old and in the new world. Of all the&s;e va&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, he re&s;erved nothing for him&s;elf but an annual pen&s;ion of an hundred thou&s;and crowns, to defray the charges of his family, and to afford him a &s;mall &s;um for acts of beneficence and charity <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">The Emperor's re&s;ignation is an event not only of &s;uch importance, but of &s;uch a nature, that the preci&s;e date of it, one would expect, &s;hould have been a&s;certained by hi&s;torians with the greate&s;t accuracy. There is, however, an amazing and unaccountable diver&s;ity among them with regard to this point. All agree that the deed by which Charles transferred to his &s;on his do|minions in the Netherlands, bears date at Bru&s;&s;els the 25th of October. Sandoval fixes on the 23th of October as the day on which the ceremony of re&s;ignation happened, and he was pre&s;ent at the tran&s;action, vol. ii. p. 592. Godleveus who publi&s;hed a treati&s;e de Abdicatione Caroli V. fixes the pub|lick ceremony as well as the date of the in&s;trument of re&s;ignation on the 25th. Per&eacute; Barre, I know not on what authority, fixes it on the 24th of Novem|ber. Hi&s;t. D'Alem. viii. 976. Herrera agrees with Godleveus in &s;enti|ment, tom i. 155, as likewi&s;e does Pallavicini, who&s;e authority with re&s;pect to dates, and every thing where a minute accuracy is requi&s;ite, is of great weight. Hi&s;t. lib. xvi. p. 168. Hi&s;torians differ no le&s;s with regard to the day on which Charles re&s;igned the crown of Spain to his &s;on. According to M. de Thou, it was a month after his having re&s;igned his dominions in the Netherlands, i. e. about the 25th of November, Thuan. lib. 16 p. 571. Ac|cording to Sandoval it was on the 16th of January 1556, Sand. ii. 603. An|tonio di Vera agrees with him, Epitome del Vida del Car. V. p. 110. Ac|cording to Pallavicini it was on the 17th. Pal. lib. xvi. p. 168. and with him Herrera agrees. Vida del D. Felipe, tom. i. p 233. But Ferreras fixes it on the fir&s;t day of January. Hi&s;t. Gener. tom. ix. p. 371. M. de Beaucaire &s;uppo&s;es the re&s;ignation of the crown of Spain to have been executes, a few days after the re&s;ignation of the Netherlands, Com. de Reb. Gall p. 879. It is remarkable that in the treaty of truce, at Vaucelles, though Charles had made over all his dominions to his &s;on &s;ome weeks previous to the conclu&s;i|on of it, all the &s;tipulations are in the Emperor's name, and Philip is only de&s;igned King of England and Naples. It is certain Philip was not pro|claimed King of Ca&s;tile, &amp;c. at Valladolid &s;ooner than the 24th of March. Sandov. ii. p. 606, and previous to that ceremony, he did not chu&s;e, it would &s;eem, to a&s;&s;ume the title of King of any of his Spani&s;h Kingdoms, or to perform any acts of royal juri&s;diction. In a deed annexed to the treaty of truce, dated April 19th, he a&s;&s;umes the title of King of Ca&s;tile, &amp;c. in the u&s;ual &s;tile of the Spani&s;h monarchs in that age. Corps Dipl. tom. iv.

<P>BY yielding to their intreaties, he had the &s;atisfacti|on, before he left the Low-Countries, of taking a con|&s;iderable &s;tep towards a peace with France, which he ardently wi&s;hed for, not only on his &s;on's account, but that he might have the merit, when quitting the world, of re-e&s;tabli&s;hing that tranquillity in Europe, which he had bani&s;hed out of it almo&s;t from the time that he a&s;&s;umed the admini&s;tration of affairs. Some time previous to his re&s;ignation, commi&s;&s;ioners had been appointed by him and by the French King, in order to treat of an exchange of pri&s;oners. In their conferences at the abbey of Vaucelles, near Cambray, an expedient was accidentally propo&s;ed for terminating ho&s;tilities betwixt the contending monarchs, by a long truce, during the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of which, and without di&s;cu&s;&s;ing their re&s;pective claims, each &s;hould retain what was in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Charles, &s;en&s;ible how much his kingdoms were exhau&s;ted by the expen&s;ive and almo&s;t continual wars in which his ambition had engaged him, and eager to gain for his &s;on a &s;hort in|terval of peace, that he might e&s;tabli&s;h him&s;elf firmly on his throne, declared warmly for clo&s;ing with the overture, though manife&s;tly di&s;honourable as well as di&s;advantageous; and &s;uch was the re&s;pect due to his wi&s;dom and experience, that Philip, notwith&s;tanding his unwillingne&s;s to purcha&s;e peace by &s;uch conce&s;&s;ions, did not pre&s;ume to urge his opinion in oppo&s;ition to that of his father.</P>
<P>HENRY could not have he&s;itated one moment about giving his con&s;ent to a truce or. &s;uch conditions, as
<PB N="272" REF="011837_1110_0F9D8948F1480B08">
would leave him in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the greater part of the Duke of Savoy's dominions, together with the important conque&s;t which he had made on the Ger|man frontier. But it was no ea&s;y matter to reconcile &s;uch a &s;tep with the engagements that he had come under to the Pope, in his late treaty with him. The Con&s;table Montmorency, however, repre&s;ented in &s;uch a &s;triking light, the imprudence of &s;acrificing the true inrere&s;ts of his kingdom to the&s;e ra&s;h obliga|tions, and took &s;uch advantage of the ab&s;ence of the Cardinal of Lorraine, who had &s;educed the King into his alliance with the Caraffas, that Henry, naturally fluctuating and un&s;teady, and apt to be influenced by the advice la&s;t given him, authorized his amba&s;&s;a|dors to &s;ign a treaty of truce with the Emperor for five years, on the terms which had been propo&s;ed. But that he might not &s;eem to have altogether for|gotten his ally the Pope, who he fore&s;aw would be highly exa&s;perated, he, in order to &s;ooth him, took care that he &s;hould be expre&s;ly included in the truce <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Ribier. ii. 626.

the&s;e accounts he confidently pronounced that this like many preceding negociations, would terminate in nothing. But later and more certain intelligence &s;oon convinced him that in political affairs no rea&s;on|ing is more fallacious, than, becau&s;e an event is im|probable, to conclude that it will not happen. The &s;udden and unexpected conclu&s;ion of the truce filled Paul with a&s;toni&s;hment and terror. The Cardinal of Lorrain dur&s;t not encounter that &s;torm of indignation, to which he knew he &s;hould be expo&s;ed from the haughty Pontiff, who had &s;o good rea&s;on to be incen&s;|ed; but departing abruptly from Rome, he left to the Cardinal Tournon the difficult ta&s;k of attempting to &s;ooth Paul and his nephews. They were fully &s;en|&s;ible of the perilous &s;ituation in which they now &s;tood. By their engagements with France, which were no longer &s;ecret, they had highly irritated Philip. They dreaded the violence of his implacable temper. The Duke of Alva, a mini&s;ter, fitted as well by his abilities as by the &s;everity of his nature, for executing all Phi|lip's rigorous &s;chemes, had advanced from Milan to Naples, and began to a&s;&s;emble troops on the frontiers of the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical State. While they, if de&s;erted by France, mu&s;t not only relinqui&s;h all the hopes of do|minion and &s;overeignty to which their ambition a&s;|pired, but remain expo&s;ed to the re&s;entment of the Spani&s;h monarch, without one ally to protect them again&s;t an enemy with whom they were &s;o little able to contend.</P>
<P>UNDER the&s;e circum&s;tances, Paul had recour&s;e to the arts of negociation and intrigue, of which the Pa|pal court knows well how to avail it&s;elf in order to ward off any calamity threatened by an enemy &s;uperi|or in power. He affected to approve highly of the truce, as an happy expedient for putting a &s;top to the effu&s;ion of Chri&s;tian blood. He expre&s;&s;ed his warme&s;t wi&s;hes that it might prove the forerunner of a defini|tive peace. He exhorted the rival Princes to embrace this favourable opportunity of &s;etting on foot a nego|ciation for that purpo&s;e, and offered, as their common father, to be mediator between them. Under this pretext, he appointed Cardinal Rebiba his nuncio to
<PB N="274" REF="011837_1112_0F9D894A70CD8BA8">
the court of Bru&s;&s;els, and his nephew Cardinal Caraffa to that of Paris. The publick in&s;tructions given to both were the &s;ame; that they &s;hould u&s;e their utmo&s;t endeavours to prevail with the two monarchs to ac|cept of the Pope's mediation, that by means of it, peace might be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, and mea&s;ures might be taken for a&s;&s;embling a general council. But under this &s;pecious appearance of zeal for attaining objects &s;o de&s;irable in them&s;elves, and &s;o becoming his &s;acred character to pur&s;ue, Paul concealed very different in|tentions, Caraffa, be&s;ides his publick in&s;tructions, received a private commi&s;&s;ion to &s;olicit the French King to renounce the treaty of truce, and to renew his engagements with the Holy See, and he was im|powered to &s;pare neither entreatries, nor promi&s;es, nor bribes, in order to gain that point. This both the uncle and the nephew con&s;idered as the real end of the emba&s;&s;y; while the other &s;erved to amu&s;e the vul|gar, or to deceive the Emperor and his &s;on. The Car|dinal, accordingly, &s;et out in&s;tantly for Paris, and travelled with the greate&s;t expedition, while Rebiba was detained &s;ome weeks at Rome; and when it be|came nece&s;&s;ary for him to begin his journey, he re|ceived &s;ecret orders to protract it as much as po&s;&s;ible, that the i&s;&s;ue of Caraffa's negociation might be known before he &s;hould reach Bru&s;&s;els, and according to that, proper directions might be given to him with regard to the tone which he &s;hould a&s;&s;ume, in treating with the Emperor and his &s;on <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Pallav. lib. xiii. p. 169.

<P>CARAFFA made his entry into Paris with extraor|dinary pomp; and having pre&s;ented a con&s;ecrated &s;word to Henry as the protector, on who&s;e aid the Pope relied in the pre&s;ent exigency, he be&s;ought him not to di&s;regard the entreaties of a parent in di&s;tre&s;s, but to employ that weapon which he gave him in his defence. This he repre&s;ented not only as a duty of filial piety, but as an act of ju&s;tice. As the Pope, from confidence in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;upport which his late treaty with France entitled him to expect, had taken &s;uch &s;teps as had irritated the King of Spain, he
<PB N="275" REF="011837_1113_0F9D894B2EA78310">
conjured Henry not to &s;uffer Paul and his family to be cru&s;hed under the weight of that re&s;entment which they had drawn on them&s;elves merely by their attachment to France. Together with this argument addre&s;&s;ed to his genero&s;ity, he employed another which he hoped would work on his ambition. He affirmed that now was the time; when, with the mo&s;t certain pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s; he might attack Philip's dominions in Italy; that the flower of the veteran Spani&s;h bands had peri&s;h|ed in the wars of Hungary, Germany, and the Low-Countries; that the Emperor had left his &s;on an ex|hau&s;ted trea&s;ury, and kingdoms drained of men; that he had no longer to contend with the abilities, the ex|perience, and good fortune of Charles, but with a monarch &s;carce &s;eated on his throne, unpracti&s;ed in command, odious to many of the Italian &s;tates, and dreaded by all; that the Pope, who had already levi|ed &s;oldiers, would bring a con&s;iderable army into the field, which, when joined by a &s;ufficient number of French troops, might by one bri&s;k and &s;udden effort, drive the Spaniards out of Naples, and add to the crown of France a kingdom, the conque&s;t of which had been the great object of all his predece&s;&s;ors during half a century, and the chief motive of all their expe|ditions into Italy.</P>
<P>EVERY word Caraffa &s;poke, made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on Henry; con&s;cious, on the one hand, that the Pope had ju&s;t cau&s;e to reproach him with not having con&s;ulted the laws either of genero&s;ity or of decency, when he renounced his league with him, and had agreed to the truce of Vaucelles; and eager on the other hand, not only to di&s;tingui&s;h his reign by a con|que&s;t, which three former monarchs had attempted without &s;ucce&s;s, but likewi&s;e to acquire an e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of &s;uch dignity and value for one of his &s;ons. Reverence, however for the oath, by which he had &s;o lately confirmed the truce of Vaucelles; the extreme old age of the Pope, who&s;e death might occa&s;ion an intire revolution in the political &s;y&s;tem of Italy; to|gether with the repre&s;entations of Montmorency, who repeated all the arguments that he had u&s;ed again&s;t the fir&s;t league with Paul, and pointed out the great
<PB N="276" REF="011837_1114_0F9D894BEFFDFED8">
and immediate advantages which France derived from the truce; kept Henry for &s;ome time in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and might po&s;&s;ibly have outweighed all Caraffa's arguments. But the Cardinal was not &s;uch a novice in the arts of intrigue and negociation, as not to have expedients ready for removing or &s;urmounting all the&s;e ob&s;tacles. To obviate the King's &s;cruple with regard to his oath, he produced powers from the Pope to ab&s;olve him from the obligation of it. By way of &s;ecurity again&s;t any danger which he might apprehend from the Pope's death, he engaged that his uncle would make &s;uch a nomination of Cardinals, as &s;hould give Henry the ab&s;olute command of the next election, and enable him to place in the Papal chair a per&s;on entirely de|voted to his intere&s;t.</P>
<P>IN order to counterbalance the effect of the Con&s;ta|ble's opinion and influence, he employed not only the active talents of the Duke of Gui&s;e, and the eloquence of his brother the Cardinal of Lorrain, but the addre&s;s of the Queen, aided by the more powerful arts of Dia|na of Poitiers, who, unfortunately for France, co|operated with Catharine in this point, though &s;he took plea&s;ure, on almo&s;t every other occa&s;ion, to thwart and mortify her. They, by their united &s;olicitations, ea&s;ily &s;wayed the King, who leaned of his own ac|cord to that &s;ide, towards which they wi&s;hed him to encline. All Montmorency's prudent remon&s;trances were di&s;regarded; the nuncio ab&s;olved Henry from his oath; and he &s;igned a new league with the Pope, which rekindled the flames of war both in Italy and in the Low-Countries.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as Paul was informed by his nephew that there was a fair pro&s;pect of his &s;ucceeding in this ne|gociation, he di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger after the nuncio Rebiba, with orders to return to Rome, without proceeding to Bru&s;&s;els. As it was now no longer ne|ce&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve that tone of moderation, which &s;uited the character of a mediator, and which he had affected to a&s;&s;ume, or to put any farther re&s;traint up|on his re&s;entment again&s;t Philip, he boldly threw off the ma&s;k, and took &s;uch violent &s;teps as rendered a rupture unavoidable. He &s;eized and impri&s;oned the
<PB N="277" REF="011837_1115_0F9D894CB1921BF8">
Spani&s;h envoy at his court. He excommunicated the Collonna's; and having deprived Mark Antonio, the head of that family, of the dukedom of Paliana, he granted that dignity, together with the territory an|nexed to it, to his nephew the Count of Montorio. He ordered a legal information to be pre&s;ented in the con&s;i&s;tory of Cardinals again&s;t Philip, &s;etting forth that he, notwith&s;tanding the fidelity and allegiance due by him to the Holy See, of which he held the crown of Naples, had not only afforded a retreat in his dominions to the Collonna's, whom the Pope had excommunicated and declared rebels, but had fur|ni&s;hed them with arms, and was ready, in conjuncti|on with them, to invade the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical State in an ho&s;tile manner; that &s;uch conduct in a va&s;&s;al was to be deemed trea&s;on again&s;t his liege lord, the puni&s;h|ment of which was the forfeiture of his fief. Upon this the con&s;i&s;toral advocate reque&s;ted the Pope to take cognizance of the cau&s;e, and to appoint a day for hearing of it, when he would make good every arti|cle of the charge, and expect from his ju&s;tice that &s;en|tence which the heinou&s;ne&s;s of Philip's crimes merited. Paul, who&s;e pride was highly flattered with the idea of trying and pa&s;&s;ing judgment on &s;o great a King, a&s;|&s;ented to his reque&s;t; and as if it had been no le&s;s ea&s;y to execute than to pronounce &s;entence, declared that he would con&s;ult with the Cardinals concerning the formalities requi&s;ite in conducting the trial <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Pallav. lib. xiii. 171.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT while Paul allowed his pride and re&s;entment to drive him on with &s;uch headlong impetuo&s;ity, Philip di&s;covered an amazing moderation on his part. He had been taught by the Spani&s;h eccle&s;ia&s;ticks who had the charge of his education, a profound venera|tion for the Holy See. This &s;entiment, which had been early infu&s;ed, grew up with him as he advanced in years, and took full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his mind, which was naturally thoughtful, &s;erious, and prone to &s;u|per&s;tition. When he fore&s;aw a rupture with the Pope approaching, he had &s;uch violent &s;cruples with re&s;pect to the lawfulne&s;s of taking arms again&s;t the Vicege|rent
<PB N="278" REF="011837_1116_0F9D894D6E08DDC8">
of Chri&s;t, and the common father of all Chri&s;tians, that he con&s;ulted &s;ome Spani&s;h divines up|on that point. Though they, with the u&s;ual dexte|rity of ca&s;ui&s;ts in accommodating their re&s;pon&s;es to the circum&s;tances of tho&s;e who apply to them for directi|on, a&s;&s;ured him that, after employing prayers and re|mon&s;trances in order to bring the Pope to rea&s;on, he had full right, both by the laws of nature and of Chri&s;|tianity, not only to defend him&s;elf when attacked, but to begin ho&s;tilities, if that were judged the mo&s;t proper expedient, for preventing the effects of Paul's violence and inju&s;tice. Yet Philip &s;till deliberated and delayed, con&s;idering it as a mo&s;t cruel misfortune, that his admini&s;tration &s;hould open with an attack on a per&s;on, who&s;e &s;acred function and character he &s;o highly re&s;pected <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ferrer.

<P>AT la&s;t the Duke of Alva, who, in compliance with his ma&s;ter's &s;cruples, had continued to negociate long after he &s;hould have begun to act, finding Paul inexorable, and that every overture of peace, and every appearance of he&s;itation on his part encrea&s;ed the Pontiff's natural arrogance, took the field and enter|ed the eccle&s;ia&s;tical territories. His army did not ex|ceed twelve thou&s;and men, but it was compo&s;ed of veteran &s;oldiers, and commanded chiefly by tho&s;e Ro|man barons, whom Paul's violence had driven into exile. The valour of the troops, and the animo&s;ity of their leaders who fought in their own quarrel, and to recover their own e&s;tates, &s;upplied the want of numbers. As none of the French forces were yet ar|rived, Alva &s;oon became ma&s;ter of the Compagna Romana; &s;ome cities being &s;urrendered through the cowardice of the garri&s;ons, which con&s;i&s;ted of raw &s;oldiers, ill di&s;ciplined, and wor&s;e commanded; the gates of others being opened by the inhabitants, who were eager to receive back their ancient ma&s;ters. Al|va, that he might not be taxed with impiety in &s;eiz|ing the patrimony of the church, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the towns which capitulated, in the name of the col|lege of cardinals, to which, or to the Pope that &s;hould

be cho&s;en to &s;ucceed Paul, he declared that he would immediately re&s;tore them.</P>
<P>THE rapid progre&s;s of the Spaniards, who&s;e light troops made inroads to the gates of Rome, filled that city with con&s;ternation; and Paul, though inflexible and undaunted him&s;elf, was obliged to give way &s;o far to the fears and &s;olicitations of the Cardinals, as to &s;end deputies to Alva in order to propo&s;e a ce&s;&s;ation of arms. The Pope yielded the more readily, as he was &s;en&s;ible of a double advantage which might be deriv|ed from obtaining that point. It would deliver the inhabitants of Rome from their pre&s;ent terror, and would afford time for the arrival of the &s;uccours which he expected from France. Nor was Alva un|willing to clo&s;e with the overture, both as he knew how de&s;irous his ma&s;ter was to terminate a war, which he had undertaken with reluctance, and as his army was &s;o much weakened by garri&s;oning the great num|ber of towns which he had reduced, that it was &s;carce in a condition to keep the field without fre&s;h recruits, A truce was accordingly concluded fir&s;t for ten, and afterwards for forty days, during which various &s;chemes of peace was propo&s;ed, and perpetual nego|ciations were carried on, but with no &s;incerity on the part of the Pope. The return of his nephew the car|dinal to Rome, the receipt of a con&s;iderable &s;um re|mitted by the King of France, the arrival of one bo|dy of French troops, together with the expectation of others which had begun their march, rendered him more arrogant than ever, and bani&s;hed all thoughts from his mind, but tho&s;e of war and revenge <NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Pallav. lib. xiii. 177.

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF THE REIGN OF THE EMPEROR CHARLES V. BOOK XII.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE the&s;e operations or intrigues kept the Pope and Philip bu&s;y and attentive, the Emperor di&s;entangled him&s;elf finally from all the affairs of this world, and &s;et out for the place of his retreat. He had hitherto retained the Imperial dignity not from any unwillingne&s;s to relinqui&s;h it, for after having re&s;igned the real and exten&s;ive authority that he enjoyed in his hereditary dominions, to part with the limited and often ideal juri&s;diction, which belongs to an elective crown, was no great &s;acrifice. His &s;ole motive for delay was to gain a few months, for mak|ing one trial more, in order to accompli&s;h his favour|ite &s;cheme in behalf of his &s;on. At the very time Charles &s;eemed to be mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of the vanity of worldly grandeur, and when he appeared to be quit|ting it not only with indifference, but with contempt, the va&s;t &s;chemes of ambition, which had &s;o long oc|cupied and engro&s;&s;ed his mind, &s;till kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. He could not think of leaving his &s;on, among the Princes of Europe, in a rank inferior to that which he him&s;elf had held. As he had, &s;ome years before, made a fruitle&s;s attempt to &s;ecure the Imperial crown to Philip, that by uniting it to the kingdoms of Spain,
<PB N="281" REF="011837_1119_0F9D894FB1F65438">
and the dominions of the hou&s;e of Burgundy, he might put it in his power to pro&s;ecute, with a better pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s, tho&s;e great plans, which his own infirmities had obliged him to abandon, he was &s;till unwilling to relinqui&s;h this flattering project as chime|rical or unattainable.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the repul&s;e which he had formerly met with from his brother Ferdinand, he re|newed his &s;olicitations with fre&s;h importunity, and during the &s;ummer, had tried every art, and employ|ed every argument, which he thought could induce him to quit the Imperial throne to Philip, and to ac|cept of the inve&s;titure of &s;ome province, either in Ita|ly, or in the Low-Countries, as an equivalent <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Amba&s;&s;ades des No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">illes, tom. v. 356.</NOTE>. But Ferdinand, who was &s;o firm and inflexible with regard to this point, that he had paid no regard to the &s;olici|tations of the Emperor, even when they were enforced with all the weight of authority, which accompanies &s;upreme power, received the overture, that now came from him in the &s;ituation to which he had de&s;cended, with greater indifference, and would not deign to li&s;ten to it. Charles, a&s;hamed of his own credulity in having imagined that he might accompli&s;h that now, which he had attempted formerly without &s;ucce&s;s, de&s;i&s;ted finally from his &s;cheme. He then re&s;igned the govern|ment of the Empire, and having transferred all his claims of obedience and allegiance from the Germa|nick body, to his brother the King of the Romans, he executed a deed to that effect, with all the forma|lities, requi&s;ite in &s;uch an important tran&s;action. The in&s;trument of re&s;ignation he committed to William Prince of Orange, and impowered him to lay it be|fore the college of electors <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Golda&s;t. Con&s;tit. Imper. pars i. 576.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOTHING now remained to detain Charles from that retreat for which he langui&s;hed. Every thing having been prepared &s;ome time for his voyage, he &s;et out for Zuitburg in Zealand, where the fleet had orders to rendezvous. In his way thither he pa&s;&s;ed through Ghent, and after &s;topping there a few days, to indulge that tender and plea&s;ant melancholy, which
<PB N="282" REF="011837_1120_0F9D89506E771C70">
ari&s;es in the mind of every man in the decline of life, on vi&s;iting the place of his nativity, and viewing the &s;cenes and objects familiar to him in his early youth, he pur&s;ued his journey accompanied by his &s;on Philip, his daughter the archdutche&s;s, his &s;i&s;ters the dowager Queens of France and Hungary, Maximilian his &s;on-in-law, and a numerous retinue of the Flemi&s;h nobi|lity. Before he went on board, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them, with marks of his attention or regard, and taking leave of Philip with all the tenderne&s;s of a father who embraced his &s;on for the la&s;t time, he &s;et &s;ail on the &s;eventeenth of September under the convoy of a large fleet of Spani&s;h, Flemi&s;h and Engli&s;h &s;hips, He de|clined a pre&s;&s;ing invitation, from the Queen of Eng|land, to land in &s;ome part of her dominions, in order to refre&s;h him&s;elf, and that &s;he might have the com|fort of &s;eeing him once more. It cannot &s;urely, &s;aid he, be agreeable to a Queen to receive a vi&s;it from a father-in-law, who is now nothing more than a private gentleman.</P>
<P>HIS voyage was pro&s;perous and agreeable, and he arrived at Laredo in Bi&s;cay on the eleventh day after he left Zealand. As &s;oon as he landed, he fell pro|&s;trate on the ground; and con&s;idering him&s;elf now as dead to the world, he ki&s;&s;ed the earth and &s;aid, "Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked I now return to thee, thou common mother of man|kind." From Laredo he pur&s;ued his journey to Bur|gos, carried by his attendants &s;ometimes in a chair, and &s;ometimes in a hor&s;e litter, &s;uffering exqui&s;ite pain at every &s;tep, and advancing with the greate&s;t difficulty. Some of the Spani&s;h nobility repaired to Burgos in order to pay court to him, but they were &s;o few in number, and their attendance was &s;o negli|gent, that Charles ob&s;erved it, and felt, for the fir&s;t time, that he was no longer a Monarch. Accu&s;tom|ed from his early youth to the dutiful and officious re|&s;pect with which tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;overeign power are attended, he had received it with the credulity com|mon to Princes, and was weak enough to be mortifi|ed, when he now di&s;covered, that he had been in|debted to his fortune, for much of that ob&s;equious re|gard,
<PB N="283" REF="011837_1121_0F9D8951328EB408">
which he had fondly thought was paid to his per&s;onal qualities. But though he might have &s;oon learned to forget the levity of his &s;ubjects, or to have de&s;pi&s;ed their neglect, he was more deeply afflicted with his &s;on's ingratitude, who, forgetting already how much he owed to his father's bounty, obliged him to remain &s;ome weeks at Burgos, before he paid him the fir&s;t moiety of that &s;mall pen&s;ion, which was all that he had re&s;erved of &s;o many kingdoms. As with|out this &s;um, Charles could not di&s;mi&s;s his dome&s;ticks with &s;uch rewards as their &s;ervices merited, or his ge|nero&s;ity had de&s;tined for them, he could not help ex|pre&s;&s;ing both &s;urpri&s;e and di&s;&s;atisfaction <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Strada de Bello Belg. lib. i. 9.</NOTE>. At la&s;t the money was paid, and Charles having di&s;mi&s;&s;ed a great number of his dome&s;ticks, who&s;e attendance he thought would be &s;uperfluous or cumber&s;ome in his retirement, he proceeded to Valadolid. There he took a la&s;t and tender leave of his two &s;i&s;ters, whom he would not permit to accompany him to his &s;olitude, though they intreated it with tears, not only that they might have the con&s;olation of contributing by their attendance and care to mitigate or to &s;ooth his &s;ufferings, but that they might reap in&s;truction and benefit by join|ing with him in tho&s;e pious exerci&s;es, to which he had con&s;ecrated the remainder of his days.</P>
<P>FROM Valladolid he continued his journey to Pla|zencia in E&s;tremadura. He had pa&s;&s;ed through that city a great many years before, and having been &s;truck at that time with the delightful &s;ituation of the mona|&s;try of St. Ju&s;tus belonging to the order of St. Jerome, not many miles di&s;tant from that place, he had then ob&s;erved to &s;ome of his attendants, that this was a &s;pot to which Diocle&s;ian might have retired with plea&s;ure. The impre&s;&s;ion had remained &s;o &s;trong on his mind, that he pitched on it as the place of his retreat. It was &s;eated in a vale of no great extent, watered by a &s;mall brook, and &s;urrounded by ri&s;ing grounds, covered with lofty trees; both from the nature of the &s;oil, and temperature of the climate, it was e&s;teemed the mo&s;t healthful and delicious &s;ituation in Spain. Some months before his re&s;ignation he had &s;ent an architect
<PB N="284" REF="011837_1122_0F9D8951F0F8D998">
thither, to add a new apartment to the mona&s;tery, for his accommodation; but he gave &s;trict orders that the &s;tile of the building &s;hould be &s;uch as &s;uited his pre&s;ent &s;tation, rather than his former dignity. It con|&s;i&s;ted only of &s;ix rooms, four of them in the form of Friars cells, with naked walls; and the other two, each twenty feet &s;quare, were hung with brown cloth, and furni&s;hed in the mo&s;t &s;imple manner. They were all level with the ground; with a door on one &s;ide into a garden, of which Charles him&s;elf had given the plan, and had filled it with various plants, which he pro|po&s;ed to cultivate with his own hands. On the other &s;ide it communicated with the chapel of the mona&s;te|ry, in which he was to perform his devotions. Into this humble retreat, &s;carce &s;ufficient for the comforta|ble accommodation of a private gentleman, did Charles enter, with twelve dome&s;ticks only. He buried there, in &s;olitude and &s;ilence, his grandeur, his ambition, to|gether with all tho&s;e va&s;t projects, which, during half a century, had alarmed and agitated Europe, filling every kingdom in it, by turns, with the terror of his arms, and the dread of being &s;ubjected to his pow|er <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Sandov. ii. 607 &amp; Zuniga. 110. Thuan. lib. xviii. 609.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE contra&s;t between Charles's conduct, and that of the Pope at this juncture, was &s;o obvious, that it &s;truck even the mo&s;t carele&s;s ob&s;ervers; nor was the compari&s;on which they made much to Paul's advan|tage. The former, a conqueror, born to reign, long accu&s;tomed to the &s;plendour which accompanies &s;u|preme power, and to tho&s;e bu&s;y and intere&s;ting &s;cenes in which an active ambition had engaged him, quitted the world, at an early period of life, that he might clo&s;e the evening of his days in tranquillity, and &s;e|cure &s;ome interval for &s;ober thought, and &s;erious re|collection. The latter, a prie&s;t, who had pa&s;&s;ed the early part of his life in the &s;hade of the &s;chools, and in the &s;tudy of the &s;peculative &s;ciences, who was &s;eem|ingly &s;o detached from the world, that he had &s;hut him&s;elf up for many years in the &s;olitude of a cloi&s;ter, and who was not rai&s;ed to the Papal throne until he had reached the extremity of old age, di&s;covered at
<PB N="285" REF="011837_1123_0F9D8952B062DB28">
once all the impetuo&s;ity of youthful ambition, and engaged in va&s;t &s;chemes, in order to accompli&s;h which, he &s;crupled not to &s;catter the &s;eeds of di&s;cord and to kindle the flames of war in every corner of Europe. But Paul, regardle&s;s of the opinion and cen&s;ures of mankind, held on his own cour&s;e with his wonted arrogance and violence. The&s;e, although they &s;eemed already to have exceeded all bounds, ro&s;e to a &s;till greater height, upon the arrival of the duke of Gui&s;e in Italy.</P>
<P>THAT which the two Princes of Lorrain fore&s;aw and de&s;ired, had happened. The duke of Gui&s;e was entru&s;ted with the command of the army appointed to march to the Pope's a&s;&s;i&s;tance. It con&s;i&s;ted of twenty thou&s;and men, of the be&s;t troops in the &s;ervice of France. So high was the Duke's reputation, and &s;uch the general expectation of beholding &s;ome extraordi|nary exertion of his courage and abilities in a war, in|to which he had precipitated his country, chiefly with the de&s;ign of gaining a field where he might di&s;play his own talents, that many of the French nobility, who had no command in the troops employed, ac|companied him as volunteers. This army pa&s;&s;ed the Alps in a rigorous &s;ea&s;on, and advanced towards Rome, without any oppo&s;ition from the Spaniards, who, as they were not &s;trong enough to act in diffe|rent parts, had collected all their forces in one body on the frontiers of Naples, for the defence of that kingdom.</P>
<P>EMBOLDENED by the approach of the French, the Pope let loo&s;e all the fury of his re&s;entment again&s;t Philip, which, notwith&s;tanding the natural violence of his temper, prudential con&s;iderations had hitherto obliged him to keep under &s;ome re&s;traint. He named commi&s;&s;ioners, whom he impowered to pa&s;s judgment in the &s;uit, which the con&s;i&s;toral advocate had com|menced again&s;t Philip, in order to prove that he had forfeited the crown of Naples, by taking arms again&s;t the Holy See, of which he was a va&s;&s;al. He recalled all the nuncios re&s;ident in the courts of Charles V. of Philip, or of any of their allies. This was chiefly le|velled again&s;t Cardinal Pole, the Papal legate in the
<PB N="286" REF="011837_1124_0F9D89536FD06AE0">
court of England, who&s;e great merit, in having con|tributed &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully to reconcile that kingdom to the church of Rome, together with the expectation of farther &s;ervices that he might perform, was not &s;uf|ficient to &s;creen him from the re&s;entment which he had incurred by his zealous endeavours to re-e&s;tabli&s;h peace between the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria and France. He com|manded an addition to be made to the anathemas an|nually denounced again&s;t the enemies of the church on Maunday-Thur&s;day, whereby he inflicted the cen|&s;ure of excommunication on the authors of the late inva&s;ion of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical territories, whatever their rank or dignity might be; and, in con&s;equence of this, the u&s;ual prayers for the Emperor were omitted next day in the Pope's chapel.<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Pal. lib. xiii. 180. Mem. de Ribier, ii. 678.</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT while the Pope indulged him&s;elf in the&s;e wild and childi&s;h &s;allies of rage, he either neglected, or it exceeded his power, to take &s;uch mea&s;ures as would have rendered his re&s;entment really formidable, and fatal to his enemies. For, when the Duke of Gui&s;e entered Rome, where he was received with a triumph|al pomp, which would have been more &s;uitable if he had been returning from having terminated the war with glory, than when he was going to begin it with a doubtful chance of &s;ucce&s;s, he found none of the preparations for war in &s;uch forwardne&s;s as Caraffa had promi&s;ed, or he had expected. The Papal troops were far inferior in number to the quota &s;tipulated; no magazines &s;ufficient for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tance were form|ed; nor was money for paying them provided. The Venetians, agreeably to that cautious maxim which the misfortunes of their &s;tate had fir&s;t led them to adopt, and which was now become a fundamental principle in their policy, declared their re&s;olution to pre&s;erve an exact neutrality, without taking any part in the quarrels of Princes, &s;o far their &s;uperiors in power. The other Italian &s;tates were either openly united in league with Philip, or &s;ecretly wi&s;hed &s;uc|ce&s;s to his arms again&s;t a Pontiff, who&s;e incon&s;iderate ambition had rendered Italy once more the &s;eat of war.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="011837_1125_0F9D89542F6B2CE8">THE Duke of Gui&s;e perceived that the whole weight of the war would devolve on him; and be|came &s;en&s;ible, though too late, how imprudent it is to rely, in the execution of great enterprizes, on the aid of feeble allies. Pu&s;hed on, however, by the Pope's impatience for action, as well as by his own de&s;ire of performing &s;omething of what he had &s;o con|fidently undertaken, he marched towards Naples, and began his operations. But the &s;ucce&s;s of the&s;e fell far &s;hort of his former reputation, of what the world ex|pected, and of what he him&s;elf had promi&s;ed. He opened the campaign with the &s;iege of Civetella, a town of &s;ome importance on the Neapolitan frontier. But the ob&s;tinacy with which the Spani&s;h governor defended it, baffled all the impetuous efforts of the French valour, and obliged Gui&s;e, after a &s;iege of three weeks, to retire from the town with di&s;grace. He endeavoured to wipe off that &s;tain, by advancing boldly towards the Duke of Alva's camp, and offer|ing him battle. But that prudent commander, &s;en&s;i|ble of all the advantages of &s;tanding on the defen&s;ive before an invading enemy, declined an engagement, and kept within his entrenchments; and adhering to his plan with the &s;teadine&s;s of a Ca&s;tilian, eluded with great addre&s;s all Gui&s;e's &s;tratagems, to draw him into action <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Herrera vida de Felipe, 181.</NOTE>. Meanwhile &s;ickne&s;s wa&s;ted the French ar|my; violent di&s;&s;en&s;ions had ari&s;en between Gui&s;e and the commander of the Pope's forces; the Spaniards renewed their incur&s;ions into the eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate; the Pope, when he found, in&s;tead of the conque&s;ts and triumphs which he had fondly expected, that he could not &s;ecure his own territories from depredation, murmured, complained, and began to talk of peace. The duke of Gui&s;e, mortified to the la&s;t degree with having acted &s;uch an inglorious part, not only &s;olicit|ed his court either to reinforce his army, or to recal him, but urged Paul to fulfil his engagements; and called on Cardinal Caraffa, &s;ometimes with reproach|es, and &s;ometimes with threats, to make good the&s;e magnificent promi&s;es, from a ra&s;h confidence in which
<PB N="288" REF="011837_1126_0F9D8954EE917A70">
he had advi&s;ed his ma&s;ter to renounce the truce of Vau|celles, and to join in league with the Pope <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Thuan. lib. xxviii. 614. Palav. lib. xiii. 181. Durn. ii. app. 317.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT while the French affairs in Italy were in this wretched &s;ituation, an unexpected event happened in the Low-Countries, which called the Duke of Gui&s;e from a &s;tation wherein he could acquire no honour, to the mo&s;t dignified and important charge which could be committed to a &s;ubject. As &s;oon as the French had di&s;covered their purpo&s;e of violating the truce of Vaucelles, not only by &s;ending an army in|to Italy, but by attempting to &s;urprize &s;ome of the frontier towns in Flanders, Philip, though willing to have avoided a rupture, determined to pro&s;ecute the war with &s;uch &s;pirit, as &s;hould make his enemies &s;en|&s;ible, that his father had not erred, when he judged him to be &s;o capable of government, that he had giv|en up the reins into his hands. As he knew that Henry had been at great expence in fitting out the army un|der the Duke of Gui&s;e, and that his trea&s;ury was hardly able to an&s;wer the exorbitant and endle&s;s de|mands of a di&s;tant war, he fore&s;aw that all his opera|tions in the Low-Countries mu&s;t, of con&s;equence, be feeble, and be con&s;idered only as &s;econdary to tho&s;e in Italy. For that rea&s;on he prudently re&s;olved to make his principal effort in that place where he expec|ted the French to be weake&s;t; and to bend his chief force again&s;t that quarter where they would feel a blow mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly. With this view, he a&s;&s;embled in the Low-Countries an army of about fifty thou&s;and men, the Flemings &s;erving him on this occa&s;ion with that active zeal, which &s;ubjects are wont to exert in obeying the commands of a new &s;overeign. But Phi|lip, cautious and provident, even at that early period of life, did not re&s;t all his hopes of &s;ucce&s;s on that formidable force alone.</P>
<P>HE had been labouring for &s;ome time to engage the Engli&s;h to e&s;pou&s;e his quarrel; and though it was manife&s;tly the intere&s;t of that kingdom to maintain a &s;trict neutrality, and the people them&s;elves were &s;en|&s;ible of the advantages which they derived from it; though he knew how odious his name was to the En|gli&s;h, and how aver&s;e they would be to co-operate
<PB N="289" REF="011837_1127_0F9D8955AFE6C588">
with him in any mea&s;ure, he neverthele&s;s did not de&s;pair of accompli&s;hing his point. He relied on the affection wherewith the Queen doated on him, which was &s;o violent, that even his coldne&s;s and neglect had not extingui&s;hed it; he knew her implicit reverence for his opinion, and her fond de&s;ire of gratifying him in every particular. That he might work on the&s;e with greater facility, and more certain &s;ucce&s;s, he &s;et out for England. The Queen who, during her hu&s;band's ab&s;ence, had langui&s;hed in perpetual dejection, re|&s;umed fre&s;h &s;pirits on his arrival; and without paying the lea&s;t attention either to the intere&s;t or to the in|clinations of her people, entered warmly into all his &s;chemes. In vain did her privy-council remon&s;trate again&s;t the imprudence as well as danger of involving the nation in an unnece&s;&s;ary war; in vain did they put in her mind of the &s;olemn treaties of peace &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting between England and France, which the con|duct of that nation had afforded her no pretext to vio|late. Mary, &s;oothed by Philip's care&s;&s;es, or intimi|dated by the threats which his a&s;cendant over her emboldened him at &s;ome times to throw out, was deaf to every thing that could be urged in oppo&s;ition to his &s;entiments, and in&s;i&s;ted with the greate&s;t vehe|mence on an immediate declaration of war again&s;t France. The council, though all Philip's addre&s;s and Mary's authority were employed to gain or over|awe them, &s;truggled long, and yielded at la&s;t, not from conviction, but merely from deference to the will of their &s;overeign. War was declared again&s;t France, the only one perhaps again&s;t that kingdom into which the Engli&s;h ever entered with reluctance. As Mary knew the aver&s;ion of the nation to this mea|&s;ure, &s;he dur&s;t not call a parliament in order to rai&s;e money for carrying on the war. She &s;upplied this want, however, by a &s;train of prerogative; and levied large &s;ums on her &s;ubjects by her own authority. This enabled her to a&s;&s;emble a &s;ufficient body of troops, and to &s;end eight thou&s;and men under the conduct of the Earl of Pembroke to join Philip's army <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Carte iii. 337.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="011837_1128_0F9D89566FAE3128">PHILIP, who was not ambitious of military glory, gave the command of his army to Emanuel Philibert, duke of Savoy, and fixed his own re&s;idence at Cam|bray, that he might be at hand to receive the earlie&s;t intelligence of his motions, and to aid him with his coun&s;els. The duke opened the campaign with a ma&s;terly &s;troke of addre&s;s, which ju&s;tified Philip's choice, and di&s;covered &s;uch a &s;uperiority of genius over the French generals, as almo&s;t en&s;ured &s;ucce&s;s in his &s;ub&s;equent operations. He appointed the general rendezvous of his troops at a place con&s;iderably di&s;|tant from the country which he de&s;tined to be the &s;cene of action; and having kept the enemy in &s;u&s;|pence for a good time with regard to his intentions, he at la&s;t deceived them &s;o effectually by the variety of his marches and counter-marches, that they conclud|ed that he meant to bend all his force again&s;t the pro|vince of Champagne, and would attempt to penetrate into the kingdom on that &s;ide. In con&s;equence of this opinion, they drew all their &s;trength towards that quarter, and reinforcing the garri&s;ons there, left the towns on other parts of the frontier de&s;titute of troops &s;ufficient to defend them.</P>
<P>EMANUEL, as &s;oon as he perceived that this feint had its full effect, turned &s;uddenly to the right, ad|vanced by rapid marches into Picardy, and &s;ending his cavalry, in which he was extremely &s;trong, before him, inve&s;ted St. Quintin. This was a town deemed in that age of con&s;iderable &s;trength, and of great im|portance, as there were few fortified cities between it and Paris. The fortifications, however, had been much neglected, the garri&s;on, weakened by draughts &s;ent towards Champagne, did not amount to a fifth part of the number requi&s;ite for its defence; and the governor, though a brave officer, was neither of rank nor authority, equal to the command in a place of &s;o much con&s;equence, be&s;ieged by &s;uch a formida|ble army. A few days mu&s;t have put the Duke of Sa|voy in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town, if the Admiral de Co|ligny, who thought it concerned his honour to at|tempt &s;aving a place of &s;uch importance to his coun|try, and which lay within his juri&s;diction as gover|nor

of Picardy, had not taken the gallant re&s;olution of throwing him&s;elf into it, with &s;uch a body of men as he could collect of a &s;udden. This re&s;olution he ex|ecuted with great intrepidity, and con&s;idering the nature of the enterprize, with no contemptible &s;ucce&s;s; for though one half of his &s;mall body was cut off, he, with the other, broke through the ene|my, and entered the town. The unexpected arrival of an officer of &s;uch high rank and reputation, and who had expo&s;ed him&s;elf to &s;uch danger in order to join them, in&s;pired the de&s;ponding garri&s;on with courage. Every thing that the Admiral's great &s;kill and experience in the art of war could &s;ugge&s;t, for annoying the enemy, or defending the town, was at|tempted; and the citizens as well as the garri&s;on &s;e|conding his zeal with equal ardour, &s;eemed to be de|termined that they would hold out to the la&s;t and &s;a|crifice them&s;elves in order to &s;ave their country <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Thuan. lib. xix. 647.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Duke of Savoy, whom the Engli&s;h under the Earl of Pembroke, joined about this time, pu&s;hed on the &s;iege with, the greate&s;t vigour. An army &s;o nu|merous, and &s;o well &s;upplied with every thing requi|&s;ite, carried on its approaches with great advantage again&s;t a garri&s;on which was &s;till &s;o feeble that it dur&s;t &s;eldom venture to di&s;turb or retard the enemies opera|tions by &s;allies. The Admiral, &s;en&s;ible of the ap|proaching danger and unable to avert it, acquainted his uncle the con&s;table Montmorency, who had the command of the French army, with his &s;ituation, and pointed out to him a method by which he might throw relief into the town. The Con&s;table, &s;olicitous to &s;ave a town, the lo&s;s of which would open a pa&s;&s;age for the enemy into the heart of France; and eager to extricate his nephew out of that perilous &s;ituation, in which zeal for the publick had engaged him; he re|&s;olved, though aware of the danger, to attempt what he de&s;ired. With this view he marched from La Fere towards St. Quintin at the head of his army, which was not by one half &s;o numerous as that of the enemy, and having given the command of a body of cho&s;en
<PB N="292" REF="011837_1130_0F9D8957EF53CC88">
men to Coligny's brother Dandelot who was colonel general of the French infantry, he ordered him to force his way into the town by that avenue which the Admiral had repre&s;ented as mo&s;t practicable, while he him&s;elf with the main army would give the alarm to the enemies camp on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, and endeavour to draw all their attention towards that quarter. Dan|delot executed his orders with greater intrepidity than conduct. His &s;oldiers ru&s;hed on with &s;uch headlong impetuo&s;ity, that though it broke the fir&s;t body of the enemy which &s;tood in their way, it threw them&s;elves into the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion; and being attacked by fre&s;h troops which clo&s;ed in upon them on every &s;ide, the greater part of them were cut in pieces, Dandelot, with about five hundred of the mo&s;t adventrous, and mo&s;t fortunate, making good his entrance into the town.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE the Con&s;table, in executing his part of the plan, advanced &s;o near the camp of the be&s;ieg|ers, as rendered it impo&s;&s;ible to retreat with &s;afety in the face of an enemy &s;o much &s;uperior in number. The Duke of Savoy in&s;tantly perceived Montmoren|cy's error, and prepared, with the pre&s;ence of mind and abilities of a great general, to avail him&s;elf of it. He drew up his army in order of battle, with the greate&s;t expedition, and watching the moment when the French began to file off towards La Fere, he detached all his cavalry under the command of the count of Egmont to fall on the rear, while he at the head of his infantry, advanced to &s;upport him. The French retired at fir&s;t in perfect order, and with a good coun|tenance; but when they &s;aw Egmont draw near with his formidable body of cavalry, the &s;hock of which they were con&s;cious that they could not with&s;tand, the pro&s;pect of imminent danger, added to di&s;tru&s;t of their general, who&s;e imprudence every &s;oldier now perceived, &s;truck them with general con&s;ternation. They began in&s;en&s;ibly to quicken their pace, and tho&s;e in the rear began to pre&s;s &s;o violently on &s;uch as were before them, that in a &s;hort time their march re|&s;embled a &s;light rather than a retreat. Egmont ob|&s;erving their confu&s;ion, charged them with the great|e&s;t
<PB N="293" REF="011837_1131_0F9D8958B05C2850">
fury, and in a moment all their Gen&s;darmerie, the pride and &s;trength of the French armies in that age, gave way and fled with precipitation. The infantry, however, whom the con&s;table, by his pre&s;ence and authority, kept to their colours, &s;till continued their retreat, until the enemy brought &s;ome pieces of can|non to bear upon their centre, which threw them into &s;uch di&s;order, that the cavalry renewing their attack, broke in, and the rout became univer&s;al. About four thou&s;and of the French fell in the field, and among tho&s;e the Duke of Anguyen a Prince of the blood, together with &s;ix hundred gentlemen. The Con&s;table, as &s;oon as he perceived the fortune of the the day to be irretrievable, ru&s;hed into the thicke&s;t of the enemy, with a re&s;olution not to &s;urvive the cala|mity, which his ill-conduct had brought upon his country; but having received a dangerous wound, and being wa&s;ted with the lo&s;s of blood, he was &s;ur|rounded with by &s;ome Flemi&s;h officers, to whom he was known, who protected him from the violence of the &s;oldiers, and obliged him to &s;urrender. Be&s;ides the Con&s;table, the Dukes of Montpen&s;ier and Longuc|ville, the Marechal St. Andr&eacute;, many officers of di&s;|tinction, three hundred gentlemen, and near four thou&s;and private &s;oldiers were taken pri&s;oners. All the colours belonging to the infantry, all the am|munition, and all the cannon, two pieces excepted, fell into the enemies hands. The victorious army did not lo&s;e above four&s;core men. <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Thuan. 650. Haraei Annal. Brabant. ii. 692. Herrera, 291.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS battle no le&s;s fatal to France than the ancient victories of Cre&s;&s;y and Agincourt, gained by the En|gli&s;h on the &s;ame frontier, bore a more near re&s;em|blance to the&s;e, in the &s;uddenne&s;s of the rout; in the ra&s;hne&s;s of the commander in chief; in the number of per&s;ons of note &s;lain or taken; and in the &s;mall lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by the enemy. It filled France with equal con&s;ternation. Many inhabitants of Paris with the &s;ame precipitancy and trepidation, as if the enemy had been already at their gates, quitted the city, and retired into the interior provinces. The King, by his pre&s;ence and exhortations, endeavoured to con&s;ole
<PB N="294" REF="011837_1132_0F9D89596F0070B0">
and to animate &s;uch as remained, and applying him|&s;elf with the greate&s;t diligence to repair the ruinous fortifications of the city, prepared to defend it again&s;t the attack which he in&s;tantly expected. But happily for France, Philip's caution, together with the intre|pid firmne&s;s of the Admiral de Coligny not only &s;av|ed the capital from the danger to which it was expo&s;|ed, but gained the nation a &s;hort interval, during which the people recovered from the terror and dejection occa&s;ioned by a blow no le&s;s &s;evere than unexpected, and Henry had lei&s;ure to take mea&s;ures for the pub|lick &s;ecurity with the &s;pirit which became the &s;ove|reign of a powerful and martial people.</P>
<P>PHILIP, immediately after the battle, vi&s;ited the camp at St. Quintin, where he was received with all the exultation of military triumph; and &s;uch were his tran&s;ports of joy on account of an event, which threw &s;o much lu&s;tre on the beginning of his reign, that they &s;oftened his &s;evere and haughty temper, in|to an unu&s;ual flow of courte&s;y. When the Duke of Savoy approached, and was kneeling to ki&s;s his hands, he caught him in his arms, and embracing him with warmth, "It becomes me, &s;ays he, rather to ki&s;s your hands, which have gained me &s;uch a glorious and almo&s;t bloodle&s;s victory."</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as the rejoicings and congratulations on Philip's arrival were over, a council of war was held in order to determine how they might improve their victory to the be&s;t advantage. The Duke of Savoy, &s;econded by &s;everal of the able&s;t officers formed under Charles V. in&s;i&s;ted that they &s;hould immediately relin|qui&s;h the &s;iege of St. Quintin, the reduction of which was now an object below their attention, and advance di|rectly towards Paris; that as there were neither troops to oppo&s;e, nor any town of &s;trength to retard their march, they might reach that capital while under the full impre&s;&s;ion of the a&s;toni&s;hment and terror occa&s;ion|ed by the rout of the army, and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it without re&s;i&s;tance. But Philip, le&s;s adventrous or more prudent than his generals, preferred a moderate but certain advantage, to an enterprize of greater &s;plendour, but of more doubtful &s;ucce&s;s. He repre|&s;ented
<PB N="295" REF="011837_1133_0F9D895A2E171668">
to the council the infinite re&s;ources of a king|dom &s;o powerful as France; the great number as well as martial &s;pirit of its nobles; their attachment to their &s;overeign; the va&s;t advantages with which they could carry on war in their own territories; and the una|voidable de&s;truction, which mu&s;t be the con&s;equence of their penetrating too ra&s;hly into the enemy's coun|try, before they had &s;ecured &s;uch a communication with their own, as might render a retreat &s;afe, if up|on any di&s;a&s;trous event that &s;hould become nece&s;&s;ary. On all the&s;e accounts, he advi&s;ed the continuance of the &s;iege, and his generals acquie&s;ced the more readily in his opinion, as they made no doubt of being ma&s;|ters of the town in a few days, a lo&s;s of time of &s;o little con&s;equence in the execution of their plan, that they might ea&s;ily repair it by their &s;ub&s;equent activity <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Belcar. Commentar. di Reb. Gallic. 901.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE weakne&s;s of the fortifications, and the &s;mall number of the garri&s;on, which could no longer hope either for reinforcement, or relief, &s;eemed to autho|ri&s;e this calculation of Philip's generals. But, in making it, they did not attend &s;ufficiently to the cha|racter of Admiral de Coligny, who commanded in the town. A courage undi&s;mayed and undi&s;concerted a|mid&s;t the greate&s;t dangers, an invention fruitful in re&s;ources, a genius which rouzed and &s;eemed to ac|quire new force upon every di&s;a&s;ter, a talent of go|verning the minds of men, together with a capacity of maintaining his a&s;cendant over them even under cir|cum&s;tances the mo&s;t adver&s;e and di&s;tre&s;sful, were qualities which Coligny po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in a degree &s;uperior to any general of that age. The&s;e qualities were pe|culiarly adapted to the &s;tation in which he was now placed; and as he knew the infinite importance to his country of every hour which he could gain at this juncture, he exerted him&s;elf to the utmo&s;t in contriv|ing how to protract the &s;iege, and to detain the enemy from attempting any enterprize more dangerous to France. Such were the per&s;everance and &s;kill with which he conducted the defence, and &s;uch the forti|tude and patience with which he animated the garri|&s;on, that though the Spaniards, the Flemings, and
<PB N="296" REF="011837_1134_0F9D895AEF3D23C0">
the Engli&s;h, carried on the attack with all the ardour which national emulation in&s;pires, he held out the town &s;eventeen days. He was taken pri&s;oner, at la&s;t, on the breach, overpowered by the &s;uperior number of the enemy.</P>
<P>HENRY availed him&s;elf, with the utmo&s;t activity, of the interval which the Admiral's well-timed ob&s;ti|nacy had afforded him. He appointed officers to col|lect the &s;cattered remains of the con&s;table's army; he i&s;&s;ued orders for levying &s;oldiers in every part of the kingdom; he commanded the ban and arriere ban of the frontier provinces in&s;tantly to take the field, and to join the Duke of Nevers at Laon in Picardy; he re|called the greater part of the veteran troops which &s;erved under the Marechal Bri&s;&s;ac at Piedmont; he &s;ent courier after courier to the Duke of Gui&s;e, requir|ing him, together with all his army, to return in&s;tant|ly for the defence of their country; he di&s;patched one envoy to the Grand Seignior, to &s;olicit the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his fleet, and the loan of a &s;um of money; he &s;ent another into Scotland, to incite the Scots to invade the north of England, that by drawing Mary's atten|tion to that quarter, he might prevent her from rein|forcing her troops which &s;erved under Philip. The&s;e efforts of the King were warmly &s;econded by the zeal of his &s;ubjects. The city of Paris granted him a free gift of three hundred thou&s;and livres. The other great towns imitated the liberality of the capital, and con|tributed in proportion. Several noblemen of di&s;tinc|tion engaged to garri&s;on and to defend at their own ex|pence the towns which lay mo&s;t expo&s;ed to be attack|ed by the enemy. Nor was this general concern for the publick confined to communities alone, or to tho&s;e in the higher &s;phere of life, but diffu&s;ing it&s;elf among per|&s;ons of every rank, each individual &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to act with as much vigour as if the honour of the King, and the &s;afety of the &s;tate had depended on his per&s;onal efforts <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Mem. de Ribier, ii. 701, 703.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>PHILIP, who was no &s;tranger either to the prudent mea&s;ures taken by the French monarch for the &s;ecurity of his dominions, or to the &s;pirit with which his &s;ubjects

prepared to defend them&s;elves, perceived, when it was too late, that he had lo&s;t an opportunity which could never be recalled, and that it was now vain to think of penetrating into the heart of France, He a|bandoned, therefore, without much reluctance, a &s;cheme which was too bold and hazardous to be per|fectly agreeable to his cautious temper; and employed his army, during the remainder of the campaign, in the &s;ieges of Ham and Catelet. Of the&s;e, he &s;oon be|came ma&s;ter; and the reduction of the&s;e two petty towns, together with the acqui&s;ition of St. Quintin, were all the advantages which he derived from one of the mo&s;t deci&s;ive victories gained in that century. Phi|lip him&s;elf, however, continued in high exultation, on account of his &s;ucce&s;s; and as all his pa&s;&s;ions were tinged with &s;uper&s;tition, he, in memory of the battle of St. Quintin, which had been fought on the day con&s;ecrated to St. Laurence, vowed to build a church, a mona&s;tery, and a palace &s;acred to that &s;aint and martyr. Before the expiration of the year, he laid the founda|tion of an edifice, in which all the&s;e were united, at the E&s;curial in the neighboured of Madrid; and the &s;ame principle, which dictated the vow, directed the building. But the plan of the work was &s;o formed as to re&s;emble a gridiron, which, according to the legendary tale, had been the in&s;trument of St. Lau|rence's martyrdom. Notwith&s;tanding the va&s;t and expen&s;ive &s;chemes, in which his re&s;tle&s;s ambition in|volved him, Philip continued the building with &s;uch per&s;everance for twenty-two years, and re&s;erved &s;uch va&s;t &s;ums for this monument of his piety and vanity, that the monarchs of Spain are indebted to him for a royal re&s;idence, which though not the mo&s;t elegant, is certainly the mo&s;t &s;umptuous and magnificient of any in Europe <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Colmenar Annales d'E&s;pagne, tom. ii. p. 136.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t account of that fatal blow which the French had received at St. Quintin was carried to Rome by the courier whom Henry had &s;ent to recall the Duke of Gui&s;e. As Paul, even with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his French auxiliaries, had &s;carce been able to check

the progre&s;s of the Spani&s;h arms, he fore&s;aw that as &s;oon as he was deprived of their protection, his terri|tories mu&s;t be over-ran in a moment. He remon&s;trat|ed therefore with the greate&s;t violence again&s;t the de|parture of the French army, reproaching the Duke of Gui&s;e for his ill conduct, which had brought him into &s;uch an unhappy &s;ituation; and complaining of the King for de&s;erting him &s;o ungenerou&s;ly under &s;uch circum&s;tances. Gui&s;e's orders, however, were peremptory. Paul, inflexible as he was, found it nece&s;&s;ary to accommodate his conduct to the exigen|cy of his affairs, and to employ the mediation of the Venetians, and of Co&s;mo di Medici in order to obtain peace. Philip, who had been forced unwillingly to a rupture with the Pope, and who, even while &s;ucce&s;s crowned his arms, doubted &s;o much the ju&s;tice of his own cau&s;e, that he had made frequent overtures of pacification, li&s;tened eagerly to the fir&s;t propo&s;als of this nature from Paul, and di&s;covered &s;uch moderati|on in his demands as could &s;carce have been expected from a Prince elated with victory.</P>
<P>THE Duke of Alva on the part of Philip, and the Cardinal Caraffa in the name of his uncle, met at Cavi, and both being equally di&s;po&s;ed to peace, they, after a &s;hort conference, terminated the war by a treaty on the following terms: That Paul &s;hould renounce his league with France, and maintain for the future &s;uch a neutrality as became the common father of Chri&s;ten|dom; That Philip &s;hould in&s;tantly re&s;tore all the towns of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical territory of which he had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; That the claims of the Caraffa's, to the dutchy of Paliano, and other deme&s;nes of the Co|lonna's &s;hould be referred to the deci&s;ion of the re|publick of Venice; that the Duke of Alva &s;hould re|pair in per&s;on to Rome, and after a&s;king pardon of Paul in his own name, and in that of his ma&s;ter, for having invaded the patrimony of the church, &s;hould receive the Pope's ab&s;olution from that crime. Thus Paul, through Philip's &s;crupulous timidity, fini&s;hed an unpro&s;perous war without any detriment to the Papal See. The conqueror appeared humble, and ac|knowledged his error; while he who had been van|qui&s;hed

Such was the &s;uper&s;titious veneration of the Spaniards for the Papal character, that Alva, though perhaps the proud|e&s;t man of the age, and accu&s;tomed from his infancy to a familiar intercour&s;e with Princes, acknowledged that when he approached the Pope, he was &s;o much overawed, that his voice failed, and his pre&s;ence of mind for&s;ook him <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Pallav. lib. xiii. 185.

<P>BUT though this war, which at its commencement threatened mighty revolutions, was brought to an end without occa&s;ioning any alteration in tho&s;e States, which were its immediate object, it produced effects of con&s;iderable con&s;equence in other parts of Italy. As Philip was extremely &s;olicitous to terminate his quar|rel with Paul as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible, he was willing to make any &s;acrifice in order to gain tho&s;e Princes, who, by joining their troops to the Papal and French army, might have prolonged the war. With this view, he entered into a negociation with Octavio Farne&s;e, Duke of Parma, and in order to &s;educe him from his alliance with France, he re&s;tored to him the city of Placentia with the territory depending on it, which Charles V. having &s;eized in the year one thou&s;and five hundred and forty-&s;even, had kept from that time in his po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, and had tran&s;mitted together with his other do|minions to Philip.</P>
<P>THIS &s;tep made &s;uch a di&s;covery of Philip's charac|ter and views to Co&s;mo di Medici, the mo&s;t &s;agacious and provident of all the Italian Princes, that he con|ceived hopes of accompli&s;hing his favourite &s;cheme of adding Siena and its territories to his dominions in Tu&s;cany. As his &s;ucce&s;s in this attempt depended en|tirely on the delicacy of addre&s;s with which it was con|ducted, he employed all the refinements of policy in the negociation which he &s;et on foot for this purpo&s;e.

When Philip endea|voured to elude a demand which he was unable to &s;a|tisfy, he affected to be extremely di&s;quieted, and mak|ing no &s;ecret of his di&s;gu&s;t, in&s;tructed his amba&s;&s;ador at Rome to open a negociation with the Pope, which &s;eemed to be the effect of it. The amba&s;&s;ador execut|ed his commi&s;&s;ion with &s;uch dexterity, that Paul, imagining Co&s;mo to be entirely alienated from the Spani&s;h intere&s;t, propo&s;ed to him an alliance with France, which &s;hould be cemented by the marriage of his elde&s;t &s;on to one of Henry's daughters. Co&s;mo received the overture with &s;uch apparent &s;atisfaction, and with &s;o many profe&s;&s;ions of gratitude for the high honour of which he had the pro&s;pect, that not only the Pope's mini&s;ters, but the French envoy at Rome talked confidently, and with little re&s;erve, of the ac|ce&s;&s;ion of that important ally, as a matter certain and decided. The account of this was quickly carried to, Philip; and Co&s;mo, who fore&s;aw how much it would alarm him, had di&s;patched his nephew Ludovico de Toledo into the Netherlands, that he might be at hand to ob&s;erve and take advantage of his con&s;ternation, before the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion which it made &s;hould in any degree abate. Co&s;mo was extremely fortunate in the choice of the in&s;trument whom he employed. Tole|do waited, with patience, until he di&s;covered with certainty, that Philip had received &s;uch intelligence of his uncle's negociations at Rome, as mu&s;t have fil|led his &s;u&s;picious mind with fear and jealou&s;y; and then craving an audience, he required payment of the money which had been borrowed by the Emperor, in the mo&s;t earne&s;t and peremptory terms. In urging that point, he artfully threw out &s;everal dark hints and ambiguous declarations, concerning the extremi|ties to which Co&s;mo might be driven by a refu&s;al of this ju&s;t demand, as well as by other grievances of which he had good rea&s;on to complain.</P>
<P>PHILIP, a&s;toni&s;hed at an addre&s;s in &s;uch a &s;train, from a Prince &s;o far his inferior as the Duke of Tu&s;|cany,
<PB N="301" REF="011837_1139_0F9D895EB350BFD0">
and comparing what he now heard with the in|formation which he had received from Italy, imme|diately concluded that Co&s;mo had ventured to a&s;&s;ume this bold and unu&s;al tone on the pro&s;pect of his union with France. In order to prevent the Pope and Hen|ry from acquiring an ally, who by his abilities and the &s;ituation of his dominions would have added both re|putation and &s;trength to their confederacy, he offered to grant Co&s;mo the inve&s;titure of Siena, if he would con&s;ent to accept of this, as an equivalent for the &s;ums due to him, and engage to furni&s;h a body of troops towards the defence of Philip's territories in Italy, again&s;t any power who &s;hould attack them. As &s;oon as Co&s;mo had brought Philip to this, which was the object of all his artifices and intrigues, he did not pro|tract the negociation by any unnece&s;&s;ary delay, or any exce&s;s of refinement, but clo&s;ed eagerly with the pro|po&s;al, and Philip, in &s;pite of the remon&s;trances of his able&s;t coun&s;ellors, &s;igned a treaty with him to that effect <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Thuan. lib. xviii. 624.

<P>AS no Prince was ever more tenacious of his rights than Philip, or le&s;s willing to relinqui&s;h any territory which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, by what tenure &s;oever he held it, the&s;e un&s;ual conce&s;&s;ions to the Dukes of Parma and Tu&s;cany, by which he wantonly gave up countries, in acquiring or defending which, his father had em|ployed many years, and wa&s;ted much blood and trea|&s;ure, cannot be accounted for from any motive, but his &s;uper&s;titious de&s;ire of extricating him&s;elf out of the war which he had been forced to wage again&s;t the Pope. By the&s;e treaties, however, the balance of power among the Italian &s;tates was poized with great|er equality, and rendered le&s;s variable than it had been &s;ince it received the fir&s;t violent &s;hock from the inva|&s;ion of Charles VIII. of France.

other regions of Europe with blood, and rendered them, in their turn, mi&s;erable by the deva&s;tations of war.</P>
<P>THE Duke of Gui&s;e left Rome on the &s;ame day that his adver&s;ary the Duke of Alva made his ignomini|ous &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to the Pope. He was received in France as the guardian angel of the kingdom. His late ill &s;ucce&s;s in Italy &s;eeemed to be forgotten, while his for|mer &s;ervices, particularly his defence of Metz, were recounted with exaggerated prai&s;e; and he was wel|comed in every city through which he pa&s;&s;ed, as the re&s;torer of publick &s;ecurity, who, after having &s;et bounds by his conduct and valour to the victorious arms of Charles V. returned now at the call of his country, to check the formidable progre&s;s of Philip's power. The reception which he met with from Hen|ry was no le&s;s cordial and honourable. New titles were invented, and new dignities created in order to di&s;tingui&s;h him. He was appointed lieutenant-gene|ral in chief both within and without the kingdom, with a juri&s;diction almo&s;t unlimited, and hardly infe|rior to that which was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the king him&s;elf. Thus, through the &s;ingular felicity which attended the Princes of Lorrain, the mi&s;carriage of their own &s;chemes contributed to aggrandize them. The cala|mities of his country, and the ill conduct of his rival the Con&s;table, exalted the Duke of Gui&s;e to a height of dignity and power, which he could not have ex|pected to attain by the mo&s;t fortunate and mo&s;t com|pleat &s;ucce&s;s of his own ambitious projects.</P>
<P>THE Duke of Gui&s;e, eager to perform &s;omething &s;uitable to the high expectations of his countrymen, and that he might ju&s;tify the extraordinary confidence which the King had repo&s;ed in him, ordered all the troops, which could be got together, to a&s;&s;emble at Cam|piegne. Though the winter was well advanced, and had &s;et in with extreme rigour, he placed him&s;elf at their head, and took the field. By Henry's activity and the zeal of his &s;ubjects, &s;o many &s;oldiers had been rai&s;ed in the kingdom, and &s;uch con&s;iderable reinforce|ments had been drawn from Germany and Swi&s;&s;erland, as formed an army re&s;pectable even in the eyes of a
<PB N="303" REF="011837_1141_0F9D896037246CB0">
victorious enemy. Philip, alarmed at &s;eeing it put in motion at &s;uch an uncommon &s;ea&s;on, began to tremble for his new conque&s;ts, particularly St. Quin|tin, the fortifications of which were hitherto but im|perfectly repaired.</P>
<P>BUT the Duke of Gui&s;e meditated a more impor|tant enterprize; and after amu&s;ing the enemy with threatening &s;ucce&s;&s;ively different towns on the fron|tiers of Flanders, he turned &s;uddenly to the left and inve&s;ted Calais with his whole army. Calais had been taken by the Engli&s;h under Edward III. and was the fruit of that monarch's glorious victory at Cre&s;&s;y. Be|ing the only place that they retained of their ancient and exten&s;ive territories in France, and which opened to them, at all times, an ea&s;y and &s;ecure pa&s;&s;age into the heart of that kingdom, their keeping po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it &s;oothed the pride of the one nation as much as it mortified the vanity of the other. Its &s;ituation was naturally &s;o &s;trong, and its fortifications deemed &s;o impregnable, that no monarch of France, how adven|turous &s;oever, had been bold enough to attack it. E|ven when the dome&s;tick &s;trength of England was bro|ken and exhau&s;ted by the bloody wars between the hou&s;es of York and Lanca&s;ter, and its attention en|tirely diverted from foreign objects, Calais had re|mained undi&s;turbed and unthreatened. Mary and her council, compo&s;ed chiefly of Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks, unac|quainted with military affairs, and who&s;e whole at|tention was turned towards extirpating here&s;y out of the kingdom, had not only neglected to take any pre|cautions for the &s;afety of this important place, but &s;eemed to think that the reputation of its &s;trength a|lone was &s;ufficient for its &s;ecurity. Full of this opi|nion, they ventured, even after the declaration of war, to continue a practice which the low &s;tate of the Queen's finances, had introduced in times of peace. As the country adjacent to Calais was overflowed dur|ing the winter, and the mar&s;hes around it became im|pa&s;&s;able, except by one avenue, which the forts of St. Agatha and Newnhambridge commanded, it had been the cu&s;tom of the Engli&s;h to di&s;mi&s;s the greater part of the garri&s;on towards the end of autumn, and
<PB N="304" REF="011837_1142_0F9D8960EE2AA638">
to replace it in the &s;pring. In vain did Lord Went|worth, the governor of Calais, remon&s;trate again&s;t this ill-timed par&s;imony, and repre&s;ent the po&s;&s;ibility of his being attacked &s;uddenly, while had not troops &s;ufficient to man the works. The privy council treat|ed the&s;e remon&s;trances with &s;corn, as if they had flowed from the timidity or the rapaciou&s;ne&s;s of the governor; and &s;ome of them, with that confidence which is the companion of ignorance, boa&s;ted that they would defend Calais with their white rods again&s;t any enemy who &s;hould approach it during winter <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e. iii. 345.</NOTE>. In vain did Philip, who had pa&s;&s;ed through Calais as he returned from England to the Netherlands, warn the Queen of the danger to which it was expo&s;ed; and acquainting her with what was nece&s;&s;ary for its &s;ecuri|ty, offered to reinforce the garri&s;on during winter with a detachment of his own troops. Mary's coun&s;ellors, though ob&s;equious to her in all points wherein religi|on was concerned, di&s;tru&s;ted, as much as the re&s;t of their countrymen, every propo&s;ition that came from her hu&s;band; and &s;u&s;pected this to be an artifice of Philip's in order to gain the command of the town, they neglected his intelligence, declined his offer, and left Calais with le&s;s than a fourth of the men requi&s;ite for its defence.</P>
<P>IT was his knowledge of this, which encouraged the Duke of Gui&s;e to venture on an enterprize, that &s;urprized his own countrymen no le&s;s than his ene|mies. As he knew that its &s;ucce&s;s depended on con|ducting his operations with &s;uch rapidity, as would af|ford the Engli&s;h no time for throwing relief into the town by &s;ea, and prevent Philip from giving him any interruption by land, he pu&s;hed the attack with a de|gree of vigour little known in carrying on &s;ieges, during that age. He drove the Engli&s;h from Fort St. Agatha at the fir&s;t a&s;&s;ault; obliged them to abandon the fort of Newnhambrige, after defending it three days; took the ca&s;tle which commanded the harbour by &s;torm; and, on the eighth day after he appeared before Calais compelled the governor, who&s;e feeble garri&s;on, which did not exceed five hundred men,

was worn out with the fatigue of &s;u&s;taining &s;o many attacks, and defending &s;uch exten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, to &s;ign a capitulation.</P>
<P>THE Duke of Gui&s;e, without allowing the Engli&s;h time to recover from the con&s;ternation occa&s;ioned by this blow, immediately inve&s;ted Gui&s;nes, the garri&s;on of which, though more numerous, defended it&s;elf with le&s;s vigour, and after &s;tanding one bri&s;k a&s;&s;ault, &s;urren|dered the town. The ca&s;tle of Hames was abandoned by the troops po&s;ted there, without waiting the ap|proach of the enemy.</P>
<P>THUS, in a few days, during the depth of winter, and at a time when the fatal battle of St. Quintin had &s;o depre&s;&s;ed the &s;anguine &s;pirit of the French, that their utmo&s;t aim was to protect their own country, without dreaming of making conque&s;ts on the enemy; the en|terprizing valour of one man drove the Engli&s;h out of Calais, after they had held it two hundred and ten years, and deprived them of every foot of land in a kingdom, where their dominions had been once &s;o exten&s;ive. This exploit, at the &s;ame time that it gave an high idea of the power and re&s;ources of France to all Europe, &s;et the Duke of Gui&s;e, in the opinion of his countrymen, far above all the generals of the age. They celebrated his conque&s;ts with immoderate tran|&s;ports of joy; while the Engli&s;h gave vent to all the pa&s;&s;ions, which animate a high-&s;pirited people, when any great national calamity is manife&s;tly owing to the ill conduct of their rulers. Mary and her mini&s;ters, formerly odious, were now contemptible in their eyes. All the terrors of her &s;evere and arbitrary ad|mini&s;tration could not re&s;train them from uttering execrations and threats again&s;t tho&s;e who, having wontonly involved the nation in a quarrel wherein it was no wi&s;e intere&s;ted, had, by their negligence or incapacity, brought irreparable di&s;grace on their country, and lo&s;t the mo&s;t valuable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion belong|ing to the Engli&s;h crown.</P>
<P>THE French King imitated the conduct of its for|mer conqueror, Edward III. with regard to Calais. He commanded all the Engli&s;h inhabitants to quit the town, and giving their hou&s;es to his own &s;ubjects,
<PB N="306" REF="011837_1144_0F9D896271126890">
whom he allured to &s;ettle there by granting them va|rious immunities, he left a numerous garri&s;on, under an experienced governor, for their defence. After this, his victorious army went into quarters of refre&s;h|ment, and the u&s;ual inaction of winter returned.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE Ferdinand a&s;&s;embled the college of e|lectors at Frankfort, in order to lay before them the deed whereby Charles V. had re&s;igned the Imperial crown, and transferred it to him. This he had hi|therto delayed, on account of &s;ome difficulties which had occurred concerning the formalities requi&s;ite in &s;upplying a vacancy occa&s;ioned by an event, to which there was no parallel in the annals of the Empire. The&s;e being at length adju&s;ted, the Prince of Orange executed the commi&s;&s;ion with which he had been en|tru&s;ted by Charles; the Electors accepted of his re&s;ig|nation; declared Ferdinand his lawful &s;ucce&s;&s;or; and put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the en&s;igns of the Imperial dignity.</P>
<P>BUT when the new Emperor &s;ent Gu&s;man, his chancellor, to acquaint the Pope with this tran&s;action, to te&s;tify his reverence towards the Holy See, and to &s;ignify that, according to form, he would &s;oon di&s;|patch an amba&s;&s;ador extraordinary to treat with his holine&s;s concerning his coronation; Paul, who nei|ther experience nor di&s;appointments could teach to bring down his lofty ideas of the papal prerogative to &s;uch a moderate &s;tandard as &s;uited the genius of the times, refu&s;ed to admit the envoy into his pre&s;ence, and declared all the proceedings at Frankfort irregular and invalid. He, contended that the Pope, as the vicegerent of Chri&s;t, was entru&s;ted with the keys both of cele&s;tial and terre&s;trial government; that from him the Imperial juri&s;diction was derived; that though his predece&s;&s;ors had authorized the Electors to chu&s;e an Emperor, whom the Holy See confirmed, this privi|lige was confined to tho&s;e ca&s;es when a vacancy was oc|ca&s;ioned by death; that the in&s;trument of Charles's re|&s;ignation had been pre&s;ented in an improper court, as it belonged to the Pope alone to reject or to accept of it, and to nominate a per&s;on to &s;upply his place; that, &s;etting a&s;ide all the&s;e objections, Ferdinand's election
<PB N="307" REF="011837_1145_0F9D896333A89818">
laboured under two defects which alone were &s;uffici|ent to render it void, for the Prote&s;tant Electors had been admitted to vote, tho', by their apo&s;tacy from the catholick faith, they had forfeited that and every other privilege of the electoral office; that Ferdinand, by ratifying the conce&s;&s;ions of &s;everal Diets in favour of hereticks, had rendered him&s;elf unworthy of the Im|perial dignity, which was in&s;tituted for the protection, not for the de&s;truction of the church. But after thun|dering out the&s;e extravagant maxims, he added with an appearance of conde&s;cen&s;ion, that if Ferdinand would renounce all title to the Imperial crown, found|ed on the election at Frankfort, make profe&s;&s;ions of repentance for his pa&s;t conduct, and &s;upplicate him, with due humility, to confirm Charles's re&s;ignation, as well as his a&s;&s;umption to the Empire, he might ex|pect every mark of favour from his paternal clemency and goodne&s;s. Gu&s;man, though he had laid his ac|count with con&s;iderable difficulties in his negociation with the Pope, little expected that he would have re|vived the&s;e antiquated and wild preten&s;ions, which a&s;toni&s;hed him &s;o much that he &s;carce knew in what tone he ought to reply. He prudently declined enter|ing into any controver&s;y concerning the nature or ex|tent of the papal juri&s;diction, and confining him&s;elf to the political con&s;iderations, which &s;hould determine the Pope to recognize an Emperor already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on, he endeavoured to place the&s;e in &s;uch a light, as he imagined could &s;carce fail to &s;trike Paul, if he were not altogether blind to his own intere&s;t. Philip &s;e|conded Gu&s;man's arguments with great earne&s;tne&s;s, by an amba&s;&s;ador whom he &s;ent to Rome of purpo&s;e, and be&s;ought the Pope to de&s;i&s;t from claims &s;o un&s;ea|&s;onable, as might not only irritate and alarm Ferdi|nand and the Princes of the Empire, but furni&s;h the enemies of the Holy See with a new rea&s;on for repre|&s;enting its juri&s;diction as incompatible with the rights of Princes, and &s;ubver&s;ive of all civil authority. But Paul, who deemed it a crime to attend any con&s;idera|tion &s;ugge&s;ted by human prudence or policy, when he thought him&s;elf called to a&s;&s;ert the prerogatives of the Papal See, remained inflexible; and, during his

<P>WHILE Henry was preparing for the approaching campaign, he received accounts of the i&s;&s;ue of his ne|gociations in Scotland. Long experience having at la&s;t taught the Scots the imprudence of involving their country in every quarrel between France and Eng|land, neither the &s;olicitations of his amba&s;&s;ador, nor the addre&s;s and authority of the Queen-regent, could prevail on them to take arms again&s;t a kingdom, with which they were at peace. On this occa&s;ion, the ar|dour of a martial nobility and of a turbulent people, was re&s;trained by regard for the publick intere&s;t and tranquillity, which, in former deliberations of this kind, had been &s;eldom attended to, by a nation al|ways prone to ru&s;h into every new war. But though the Scots adhered with &s;teadine&s;s to their pacific &s;y&s;|tem, they were extremely ready to gratify the French King in another particular, which he had given in charge to his amba&s;&s;ador.</P>
<P>THE young Queen of Scots had been affianced to the Dauphin, in the year one thou&s;and five hundred and forty-eight, and having been educated &s;ince that time in the court of France, &s;he had grown up to be the mo&s;t amiable, and one of the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed Prince&s;&s;es in that age. Henry demanded the con&s;ent of her &s;ubjects to the celebration of the marriage, and a parliament which was held for that purpo&s;e, appoint|ed eight commi&s;&s;ioners to repre&s;ent the whole body of the nation at that &s;olemnity, with power to &s;ign &s;uch deeds as might be requi&s;ite before it was conclud|ed. In &s;ettling the articles of the marriage, the Scots took all the precautions, that prudence could dictate, in order to pre&s;erve the liberty and independence of their country, while the French u&s;ed every art to &s;e|cure to the Dauphin the conduct of affairs during the Queen's life, and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown on the event of her demi&s;e. The marriage was celebrated with pomp, &s;uitable to the dignity of the parties, and the magnificence of a court, at that time, the mo&s;t

&s;plendid in Europe <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Keith's hi&s;tory of Scotland, p. 73. Append. 13. Corps Diplom. v. 21.</NOTE>. Thus Henry, in the cour&s;e of a few months, had the glory of recovering an impor|tant po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion which antiently belonged to the crown of France, and of adding to it the acqui&s;ition of a new kingdom. By this event, too, the Duke of Gui&s;e acquired new con&s;ideration and importance; the mar|riage of his niece to the apparent heir of the crown, rai&s;ing him &s;o far beyond the condition of other &s;ub|jects, as &s;eemed to render the credit he had gained by his great actions, no le&s;s permanent than it was ex|ten&s;ive.</P>
<P>WHEN the campaign opened, &s;oon after the Dau|phin's marriage, the Duke of Gui&s;e was placed at the head of the army with the &s;ame unlimited powers as formerly. Henry had received &s;uch liberal &s;upplies from his &s;ubjects, that the troops under his command were both numerous and well appointed; while Phi|lip, exhau&s;ted by the extraordinary efforts of the pre|ceding year, had been obliged to di&s;mi&s;s &s;o many of his forces during the winter, that he could not bring an army into the field capable of making head a|gain&s;t him. The Duke of Gui&s;e did not lo&s;e the fa|vourable opportunity which his &s;uperiority afforded him. He inve&s;ted Toinville in the dutchy of Lux|emburg, one of the &s;tronge&s;t towns on the frontier of the Netherlands, and of great importance to France by its neighbourhood to Metz; and, notwith&s;tand|ing the ob&s;tinate valour with which it was defended, he forced it to capitulate after a &s;iege of three weeks<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thuan. lib. xx. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the &s;ucce&s;s of this enterprize which it was ex|pected would lead to other conque&s;ts, was more than counterbalanced by an event that happened in another part of the Low-Countries. The Marechal de Termes, governor of Calais, having penetrated into Flanders without oppo&s;ition, inve&s;ted Dunkirk with an army of fourteen thou&s;and men, and took it by &s;torm on the fifth day of the &s;iege. From that he advanced to|wards Nieuport, which mu&s;t have &s;oon fallen into his hands, if the approach of the Count of Egmont with a &s;uperior army had not made it prudent to retreat.
<PB N="310" REF="011837_1148_0F9D8965EF906440">
The French troops were &s;o much encumbered with the booty which they had got at Dunkirk, or by ravaging the open country, that they moved &s;lowly; and Eg|mont, who had left his heavy baggage and artillery behind him, marched with &s;uch rapidity, that he came up with them near Gravelines, and attacked them with the utmo&s;t impetuo&s;ity. De Termes, who had the choice of the ground, having po&s;ted his troops to advantage in the angle formed by the mouth of the river Aa and the &s;ea, received him with great firmne&s;s. Victory remained for &s;ome time in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, the de&s;pe|rate valour of the French, who fore&s;aw the unavoidable de&s;truction that mu&s;t follow upon a rout in an ene|my's country, counterbalancing the &s;uperior num|ber of the Flemings, when one of tho&s;e accidents to which human prudence does not extend, decided the conte&s;t in favour of the latter. A &s;quadron of Engli&s;h &s;hips of war, which was cruizing on the coa&s;t, being drawn by the noi&s;e of the firing towards the place of engagement, entered the river Aa and turned its great guns again&s;t the right wing of the French with &s;uch effect as immediately broke that body, and &s;pread ter|ror and confu&s;ion through their whole army. The Flemings, to whom a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;o unexpected and &s;o &s;ea&s;onable, gave fre&s;h &s;pirit, redoubling their efforts, that they might not lo&s;e the advantage which fortune had pre&s;ented them, or give the enemy time to reco|ver from their con&s;ternation, the rout of the French &s;oon became univer&s;al. Near two thou&s;and were killed on the &s;pot; a greater number fell by the hands of the pea&s;ants, who, in revenge for the cruelty with which their country had been plundered, pur&s;ued the fugitives and ma&s;&s;acred them without mercy; the re&s;t were taken pri&s;oners, together with de Termes their general, and many officers of di&s;tinction. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Thuan. lib. xx. 694.</NOTE></P>
<P>THIS &s;ignal victory, for which the Count of Eg|mont was afterwards &s;o ill requited by Philip, oblig|ed the Duke of Gui&s;e to relinqui&s;h all other &s;chemes, and to ha&s;ten towards the frontier of Picardy, that he might oppo&s;e the progre&s;s of the enemy there. This di&s;a&s;ter reflected new lu&s;tre on his reputation, and once
<PB N="311" REF="011837_1149_0F9D89663552E100">
more turned the eyes of his countrymen towards him, as the only general on who&s;e arms victory always at|tended, and in who&s;e conduct as well as good fortune, they could confide in every danger. Henry reinforc|ed Gui&s;e's army with &s;o many troops, drawn from the adjacent garri&s;ons, that it &s;oon amounted to forty thou&s;and men. That of the enemy, after the junc|tion of Egmont with the Duke of Savoy, was not inferior in number. They encamped at the di&s;tance of a few leagues from one another; and each monarch having joined his re&s;pective army, it was expected that, after the vici&s;&s;itudes of good and bad &s;ucce&s;s during this and the former campaign, a deci&s;ive bat|tle would at la&s;t determine which of the rivals &s;hould take the a&s;cendant for the future, and give law to Eu|rope. But though both had it in their power, neither of them di&s;covered any inclination to bring the deci&s;i|on of a point of &s;uch importance to depend upon the uncertain and fortuitous i&s;&s;ue of a &s;ingle battle. The fatal engagements at St. Quintin and Gravelines were too recent to be &s;oon forgotten, and the pro&s;pect of encountering the &s;ame troops, commanded by the &s;ame generals, who had twice triumphed over his arms, in&s;pired Henry with a degree of caution which was not common to him. Philip, of a genius aver&s;e to bold operations in war, naturally leaned to cauti|ous mea&s;ures, and would hazard nothing again&s;t a general, &s;o fortunate and &s;ucce&s;sful as the Duke of Gui&s;e. Both monarchs, as if by agreement, &s;tood on the defen&s;ive, and fortifying their camps carefully, avoided every &s;kirmi&s;h or rencounter that might bring on a general engagement.</P>
<P>WHILE the armies continued in this inaction, peace began to be mentioned in each camp, and both Hen|ry and Philip di&s;covered an inclination to li&s;ten to any overture that tended to re-e&s;tabli&s;h it. The king|doms of France and Spain had been engaged during half a centry in almo&s;t continual wars, carried on at a great expence and productive of no con&s;iderable ad|vantage to either. Exhau&s;ted by extraordinary and uncea&s;ing efforts, which far exceeded tho&s;e to which the nations of Europe had been accu&s;tomed before the
<PB N="312" REF="011837_1150_0F9D8966F4FF42C0">
rival&s;hip between Charles V. and Francis I. both nati|ons longed &s;o much for an interval of repo&s;e, in order to recruit their &s;trength, that their &s;overeigns drew from them with difficulty the &s;upplies nece&s;&s;ary for carrying on ho&s;tilities. The private inclinations of both the Kings concurred with tho&s;e of their people. Philip was prompted to wi&s;h for peace by his fond de|&s;ire of returning to Spain. Accu&s;tomed from his in|fancy to the climate and manners of that country, he was attached to it with &s;uch extreme predilection, that he was unhappy in any other part of his domini|ons. But as he could not either with decency or &s;afe|ty quit the Low-Countries, and venture on a voyage to Spain, during the continuance of war, the pro&s;pect of a pacification which would put it in his power to execute this favourite &s;cheme, was highly acceptable. Henry was no le&s;s de&s;irous of being delivered from the burden and avocations of war, that he might have lei&s;ure to turn all his attention, and bend the whole force of his government towards &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the opini|ons of the Reformers, which were &s;preading with &s;uch rapidity in Paris, and other great towns of France, that they began to grow formidable to the e|&s;tabli&s;hed church.</P>
<P>BESIDES the&s;e publick and avowed con&s;iderations ari&s;ing from the &s;tate of the two ho&s;tile kingdoms, or from the wi&s;hes of their re&s;pective monarchs, there was a &s;ecret intrigue carried on in the court of France, which contributed as much as either of the other, to ha&s;ten and to facilitate the negociation of a peace. The Con&s;table Montmorency, during his captivity, beheld the rapid &s;ucce&s;s and growing favour of the Duke of Gui&s;e, with the envious &s;olicitude of a rival. Every advantage gained by him he con&s;idered as a fre&s;h wound to his own reputation, and he knew with what malevolent addre&s;s it would be improved to di|mini&s;h his credit with the King, and to augment that of the Duke of Gui&s;e. The&s;e arts, he was afraid, might by degrees, work on the ea&s;y and ductile mind of Hen|ry, &s;o as to efface all remains of his ancient affection towards him. But he could not di&s;cover any remedy for this unle&s;s he were allowed to return home, that he
<PB N="313" REF="011837_1151_0F9D896804CDDBC0">
might try whether by his pre&s;ence he could defeat the artifices of his enemies, and revive tho&s;e warm and ten|der &s;entiments which had long attached Henry to him, with a confidence &s;o entire, as re&s;embled rather the cordiality of private friend&s;hip, than the cold and &s;elfi&s;h connection between a monarch and one of his courtiers. While Montmorency was forming &s;chemes and wi&s;hes for his return to France with much anxie|ty of mind, but with little hope of &s;ucce&s;s, an unex|pected incident prepared the way for it. The Cardi|nal of Lorrain, who had &s;hared with his brother in the King's favour, and participated of the power which that conferred, did not bear pro&s;perity with the &s;ame di&s;cretion as the Duke of Gui&s;e. Intoxicated with their good fortune, he forgot how much they had been in|debted for their pre&s;ent elevation to their connexions with the Dutche&s;s of Valentinois, and vainly a&s;cribed all to the extraordinary merit of their family. This led him not only to neglect his benefactre&s;s, but to thwart her &s;chemes, and to talk with a &s;arca&s;tick liber|ty of her character and per&s;on. That &s;ingular wo|man, who, if we may believe contemporary writers, retained the beauty and charms of youth at the age of three&s;core, and on whom it is certain that Henry &s;till doated with all the fondne&s;s of love, felt this in|jury with &s;en&s;ibility, and &s;et her&s;elf with eagerne&s;s to revenge it. As there was no method of &s;upplanting the Princes of Lorrain &s;o effectually as by a coalition of intere&s;ts with the Con&s;table, &s;he propo&s;ed the mar|riage of her grand-daughter with one of his &s;ons, as the bond of their future union, and Montmorency readily gave his con&s;ent to the match. Having thus cemented their alliance, the dutche&s;s employed all her influence with the King in order to confirm his incli|nations towards peace, and to induce him to take the &s;teps nece&s;&s;ary for attaining it. She in&s;inuated that any overture of that kind would come with great propriety from the Con&s;table, and if committed to the conduct of his prudence, could hardly fail of &s;uc|ce&s;s.</P>
<P>HENRY, long accu&s;tomed to devolve all affairs of importance on the Con&s;table, and needing only this
<PB N="314" REF="011837_1152_0F9D896871BDAC50">
encouragement to return to his ancient habits, wrote to him immediately with his u&s;ual familiarity and af|fection, impowering him, at the &s;ame time, to take the fir&s;t opportunity of &s;ounding Philip and his mini|&s;ters with regard to peace. Montmorency made his application to Philip by the mo&s;t proper channel. He opened him&s;elf to the Duke of Savoy, who, notwith|&s;tanding the height of preferment to which he had been rai&s;ed, and the military glory which he had ac|quired in the Spani&s;h &s;ervice, was weary of remaining in exile, and langui&s;hed to return into his dominions. As there was no pro&s;pect of his recovering po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e by force of arms, he con&s;idered a definitive treaty of peace between France and Spain, as the only event by which he could hope to obtain re&s;titution. Being no &s;tranger to Philip's private wi&s;hes with re|gard to peace, he ea&s;ily prevailed on him not only to di&s;cover a di&s;po&s;ition on his part towards accommoda|tion, but to permit Montmorency to return, on his parole, to France, that he might confirm his own &s;o|vereign in his pacifick &s;entiments. Henry received the Con&s;table with the mo&s;t flattering marks of re|gard; ab&s;ence, in&s;tead of having abated or extingui&s;h|ed his friend&s;hip, &s;eemed to have given it new ardour; and he a&s;&s;umed, from the moment of his appearance in court, a higher place, if po&s;&s;ible, in his affection, and a more perfect a&s;cendant over his mind, than e|ver. The Cardinal of Lorrain and Duke of Gui&s;e, prudently gave way to a tide of favour too &s;trong for them to oppo&s;e, and confining them&s;elves to their pro|per departments, permitted, without any &s;truggle, the Con&s;table and Dutche&s;s of Valentinois to direct publick affairs at their plea&s;ure. They &s;oon prevailed on the King to nominate plenipotentiaries to treat of peace. Philip did the &s;ame. The abbey of Cercamp was fixed on as the place of congre&s;s; and all milita|ry operations were immediately terminated by a &s;u&s;|pen&s;ion of arms.</P>
<P>WHILE the&s;e preliminary &s;teps were taking to|wards a treaty which re&s;tored tranquillity to Europe, Charles V. who&s;e ambition had &s;o long di&s;turbed it, ended his days in the mona&s;try of St. Ju&s;tus. When
<PB N="315" REF="011837_1153_0F9D896935954900">
Charles entered this retreat, he formed &s;uch a plan of life for him&s;elf, as would have &s;uited the condition of a private gentleman of a moderate fortune. His ta|ble was neat but plain; his dome&s;ticks few; his in|tercour&s;e with them familiar; all the cumber&s;ome and ceremonious forms of attendance in his per&s;on were entirely aboli&s;hed, as de&s;tructive of that &s;ocial ea&s;e and tranquillity which he courted in order to &s;ooth the remainder of his days. As the mildne&s;s of the climate, together with his deliverance from the burdens and cares of government procured him at fir&s;t, a con&s;ide|rable remi&s;&s;ion from the acute pains with which he had been long tormented, he enjoyed, perhaps, more complete &s;atisfaction in this humble &s;olitude, than all his grandeur had ever yielded him. The ambitious thoughts and projects which had &s;o long engro&s;&s;ed and di&s;quited him, were quite effaced from his mind: Far from taking any part in the political tran&s;actions of the Princes of Europe, he re&s;trained his curio&s;ity even from any inquiry concerning them; and he &s;eemed to view the bu&s;y &s;cene which he had abandoned with all the contempt and indifference ari&s;ing from his thorough experience of its vanity, as well as from the plea&s;ing reflection of having di&s;entangled him&s;elf from its cares.</P>
<P>OTHER amu&s;ements, and other objects now occu|pied him. Sometimes he cultivated the plants in his garden with his own hands; &s;ometimes he rode out to the neighbouring wood on a little hor&s;e, the only one that he kept, attended by a &s;ingle &s;ervant on foot. When in infirmities confined him to his apart|ment, which often happened, and deprived him of the&s;e more active recreations, he either admitted a few gentlemen who re&s;ided near the mona&s;try to vi&s;it him, and entertained them familiarly at his table; or he employed him&s;elf in &s;tudying the principles and in forming curious works of mechani&s;m, of which he had always been remarkably fond, and to which his genius was peculiarly turned. With this view he had engaged Turriano, one of the mo&s;t ingenious arti&s;ts of that age, to accompany him in his retreat. He laboured toge|ther with him in framing models of the mo&s;t u&s;eful
<PB N="316" REF="011837_1154_0F9D8969F14743D0">
machines, as well as making experiments with regard to their re&s;pective powers, and it was not &s;eldom that the ideas of the monarch a&s;&s;i&s;ted or perfected the in|ventions of the arti&s;t. He relieved his mind, at in|tervals, with &s;lighter and more fanta&s;tick works of mechani&s;m, in fa&s;hioning puppets, which by the &s;tructure of internal &s;prings, mimicked the ge&s;tures and actions of men, to the no &s;mall a&s;toni&s;hment of the ignorant monks, who beholding movements, which they could not comprehend, &s;ometimes di&s;tru&s;ted their own &s;en&s;es, and &s;ometimes &s;u&s;pected Charles and Turriano of being in compact with invi&s;ible powers. He was particularly curious with regard to the con|&s;truction of clocks and watches, and having found, after repeated trials, that he could not bring any two of them to go exactly alike, he reflected, it is &s;aid, with a mixture of &s;urprize and regret on his own fol|ly, in having be&s;towed &s;o much time and labour on the more vain attempt of bringing mankind to a preci&s;e uniformity of &s;entiment concerning the intricate and my&s;terious doctrines of religion.</P>
<P>BUT in what manner &s;oever Charles di&s;po&s;ed of the re&s;t of his time, he con&s;tantly re&s;erved a con&s;iderable portion of it for religious exerci&s;es. He regularly at|tended divine &s;ervice in the chapel of the mona&s;try, every morning and evening; he took great plea&s;ure in reading books of devotion, particularly the works of St. Augu&s;tine and St. Bernard; and conver&s;ed much with his confe&s;&s;or, and the prior of the mona&s;|try on pious &s;ubjects. Thus did Charles pa&s;s the fir&s;t year of his retreat, in a manner not unbecoming a man perfectly di&s;engaged from the affairs of the pre|&s;ent life, and &s;tanding on the confines of a future world either in innocent amu&s;ement which &s;oothed his pains, and relieved a mind worn out with ex|ce&s;&s;ive application to bu&s;ine&s;s; or in devout occu|pations, which he deemed nece&s;&s;ary in preparing for another &s;tate.</P>
<P>BUT about &s;ix months before his death, the gout, after a longer intermi&s;&s;ion than u&s;ual, returned with a proportional increa&s;e of violence. His &s;hattered con|&s;titution had &s;carce vigour enough remaining to with|&s;tand &s;uch a &s;hock. It enfeebled his mind as much as
<PB N="317" REF="011837_1155_0F9D896AAED384B0">
his body, and from that period we &s;carce di&s;cern any traces of that &s;ound and ma&s;culine under&s;tanding, which di&s;tingui&s;hed Charles among his contempora|ries. An illiberal and timid, &s;uper&s;tition depre&s;&s;ed his his &s;pirit. He had no reli&s;h for amu&s;ements of any kind. He endeavoured to conform, in his manner of living, to all the rigour of mona&s;tick au&s;terity. He de&s;ired no other &s;ociety than that of monks, and was almo&s;t continually employed with them in chant|ing the hymns in the Mi&s;&s;al. As an expiation for his &s;ins, he gave him&s;elf the di&s;cipline in &s;ecret with &s;uch &s;everity, that the whip of cords which he employed as the in&s;trument of his puni&s;hment, was found after his decea&s;e tinged with his blood. Nor was he &s;atisfi|ed with the&s;e acts of mortification, which however &s;evere, were not unexampled. The timorous and di&s;tru&s;tful &s;olicitude which always accompanies &s;u|per&s;tition &s;till continued to di&s;quiet him, and depre|ciating all that he had done, prompted him to aim at &s;omething extraordinary, at &s;ome new and &s;ingular act of piety that would di&s;play his zeal, and merit the favour of heaven. The act on which he fixed was as wild and uncommon, as any that &s;uper&s;tition ever &s;ugge&s;ted to a weak and di&s;ordered fancy. He re&s;olv|ed to celebrate his own ob&s;equies before his death. He ordered his tomb to be created in the chapel of the mona&s;try. His dome&s;ticks marched thither in fune|ral proce&s;&s;ion, with black tapers in their hands. He him&s;elf followed in his &s;hroud. He was laid in his cof|fin, with much &s;olemnity. The &s;ervice for the dead was chanted, and Charles joined in the prayers which were offered up for the re&s;t of his &s;oul, mingling his tears with tho&s;e which his attendants &s;hed, as if they had been celebrating a real funeral. The ceremony clo&s;ed with &s;prinkling holy water on the coffin in the u&s;ual form, and all the a&s;&s;i&s;tants retiring, the doors of the chapel were &s;hut. Then Charles aro&s;e out of the coffin and withdrew to his apartment, full of the&s;e awful &s;entiments, which &s;uch a &s;ingular &s;olemnity was calculated to in&s;pire. But either the fatiguing length of the ceremony, or the impre&s;&s;ion which this image of death left on his mind affected him &s;o much,

<P>AS Charles was the fir&s;t prince of the age in rank and dignity, the part which he acted, whether we con&s;ider the greatne&s;s, the variety, or the &s;ucce&s;s of his undertakings, was the mo&s;t con&s;picuous. It is from an attentive ob&s;ervation of his conduct, not from the exaggerated prai&s;es of the Spani&s;h hi&s;torians, or the undi&s;tingui&s;hing cen&s;ure of the French, that a ju&s;t idea of Charles's genius and abilities is to be col|lected. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed qualities &s;o peculiar, as &s;trongly mark his character, and not only di&s;tingui&s;h him from the Princes who were his contemporaries, but ac|count for that &s;uperiority over them which he &s;o long maintained. In forming his &s;chemes, he was, by na|ture, as well as by habit, cautious and con&s;iderate. Born with talents, which unfolded them&s;elves &s;lowly, and were late in attaining maturity, he was accu&s;tom|ed to ponder every &s;ubject that demanded his con&s;ide|ration with a careful and deliberate attention. He bent the whole force of his mind towards it, and dwell|ing upon it with a &s;erious application, undiverted by plea&s;ure, and hardly relaxed by any amu&s;ement, he revolved it, in &s;ilence in his own brea&s;t. He then communicated the matter to his mini&s;ters, and after hearing their opinions, took his re&s;olution with a de|ci&s;ive firmne&s;s, which &s;eldom follows &s;uch &s;low con|&s;ultations. In con&s;equence of this, Charles's mea|&s;ures, in&s;tead of re&s;embling the de&s;ultory and irregu|lar &s;allies of Henry VIII. or Francis I. had the appear|ance of a con&s;i&s;tent &s;y&s;tem, in which all parts were arranged, the effects were fore&s;een, and the accidents were provided for. His promptitude in execution was no le&s;s remarkable than his patience in deliberati|on. He con&s;ulted with phlegm, but he acted with vigour; and did not di&s;cover greater &s;agacity in his choice of the mea&s;ures which it was proper to pur&s;ue,
<PB N="319" REF="011837_1157_0F9D896D06DCBAA8">
than fertility of genius in finding out the means for rendering his pur&s;uit of them &s;ucce&s;sful. Though he had naturally &s;o little of the martial turn, that during the mo&s;t ardent and bu&s;tling period of life, he remain|ed in the cabinet inactive, yet when he cho&s;e at length to appear at the head of his armies, his mind was &s;o formed for vigorous exertions in every direction, that he acquired &s;uch knowledge in the art of war, and &s;uch talents for command, as rendered him equal in reputation and &s;ucce&s;s to the mo&s;t able generals of the age. But Charles po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in the mo&s;t eminent de|gree, the &s;cience which is of greate&s;t importance to a monarch, that of knowing men, and of adapting their talents to the various departments which he allotted to them. From the death of Chievres to the end of his reign, he employed no general in the field, no mini&s;ter in the cabinet, no amba&s;&s;ador to a foreign court, no governor of a province, who&s;e abilities were inadequate to the tru&s;t which he repo&s;ed in them. Though de&s;titute of that bewitching affability of man|ners, which gained Francis the hearts of all who ap|proached his per&s;on, he was no &s;tranger to the virtues which &s;ecure fidelity and attachment. He placed un|bounded confidence in his generals; he rewarded their &s;ervices with munificence; he neither envied their fame, nor di&s;covered any jealou&s;y of their power. Almo&s;t all the generals who conducted his armies may be placed on a level with tho&s;e illu&s;trious per&s;onages, who have attained the highe&s;t eminence of military glory; and his advantages over his rivals are to be a&s;cribed &s;o manife&s;tly to the &s;uperior abilities of the commanders whom he &s;et in oppo&s;ition to them, that this might &s;eem to detract in &s;ome degree, from his own merit, if the talent of di&s;covering and employing &s;uch in&s;truments were not the mo&s;t undoubted proof of a capacity for government.</P>
<P>THERE were, neverthele&s;s, defects in his political character which mu&s;t con&s;iderably abate the admirati|on due to his extraordinary talents. Charles's ambition was in&s;atiable; and though there &s;eems to be no foun|dation for an opinion prevalent in his own age, that he had formed the chimerical project of e&s;tabli&s;hing an
<PB N="320" REF="011837_1158_0F9D896DAF980D30">
univer&s;al monarchy in Europe, it is certain that his de&s;ire of being di&s;tingui&s;hed as a conqueror involved him in continual wars, which exhau&s;ted and oppre&s;|&s;ed his &s;ubjects, and left him little lei&s;ure for giving attention to the interior police and improvement of his kingdoms, the great objects of every Prince who makes the happine&s;s of his people the end of his go|vernment. Charles, at a very early period of life, having added the Imperial crown to the kingdoms of Spain, and to the hereditary dominions of the hou&s;es of Au&s;tria and Burgundy, this opened to him &s;uch a va&s;t field of enterprize, and engaged him in &s;chemes &s;o complicated as well as arduous, that feeling his power to be unequal to the execution of the&s;e, he had often recour&s;e to low artifices unbecoming his &s;uperior talents, and &s;ometimes ventured on &s;uch de|viations from integrity as were di&s;honourable in a great Prince. His in&s;idious and fraudulent policy ap|peared more con&s;picuous, and was rendered more odious, by a compari&s;on with the open and unde&s;ign|ing character of his contemporaries Francis I. and Henry VIII. This difference, though occa&s;ioned chiefly by the diver&s;ity of their tempers, mu&s;t be a&s;cribed, in &s;ome degree to &s;uch an oppo&s;ition in the principles of their political conduct as affords &s;ome ex|cu&s;e for this defect in Charles's behaviour, though it cannot &s;erve as a ju&s;tification of it. Francis and Hen|ry &s;eldom acted but from the impul&s;e of their pa&s;&s;ions, and ru&s;hed headlong towards the object in view. Charles's mea&s;ures being the re&s;ult of cool reflection, were di&s;po&s;ed into a regular &s;y&s;tem, and carried on up|on a concerted plan. Per&s;ons who act in the former manner naturally pur&s;ue the end in view without a&s;|&s;uming any di&s;gui&s;e, or di&s;playing much addre&s;s. Such as hold the latter cour&s;e are apt, in forming as well as in executing their de&s;igns, to employ &s;uch re|finements, as always lead to artifice in conduct and often degenerate into deceit.</P>
<P>THE circum&s;tances tran&s;mitted to us, with re&s;pect to Charles's private deportment and character, are fewer and le&s;s intere&s;ting, than might have been ex+pected, from the great number of authors who have
<PB N="321" REF="011837_1159_0F9D896E700A5AE8">
undertaken to write an account of his Life. The&s;e are not the object of this hi&s;tory, which aims at repre|&s;enting the tran&s;actions of the reign of Charles V. not at delineating his private virtues or defects.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE the plenipotentiaries of France, Spain and England continued their conferences at Cercamp; and though each of them, with the u&s;ual art of nego|ciators, made at fir&s;t very high demands in name of their repective courts, yet as they were all equally de|&s;irous of peace, they would have con&s;ented recipro|cally to &s;uch abatements and re&s;trictions of their claims as mu&s;t have removed every ob&s;tacle to an accommo|dation. The death of Charles V. was a new motive with Philip to ha&s;ten the conclu&s;ion of a treaty, as it in|crea&s;ed his impatience for returning into Spain, where there was now no per&s;on greater or more illu&s;trious than him&s;elf. But in &s;pite of the concurring wi&s;h|es of all the parties intere&s;ted, an event happened which occa&s;ioned an unavoidable delay in their negociations. About a month after the opening of the conferences at Cercamp, Mary of England ended her &s;hort and inglorious reign, and Elizabeth her &s;i&s;ter was imme|diately proclaimed Queen by the Engli&s;h with univer|&s;al joy. As the powers of the Engli&s;h plenipotentia|ries expired on the death of their mi&s;tre&s;s, they could not proceed until they received a commi&s;&s;ion and in|&s;tructions from their new &s;overeign.</P>
<P>HENRY and Philip beheld Elizabeth's elevation to the throne with equal &s;olicitude. As during Mary's jealous admini&s;tration, under the mo&s;t difficult cir|cum&s;tances, and in a &s;ituation extremely delicate, &s;he had conducted her&s;elf with prudence and addre&s;s far exceeding her years, they had conceived an high idea of her abilities, and already formed expectations of a reign very different from that of her &s;i&s;ter. Equally &s;en&s;ible of the importance of gaining her favour, both monarchs &s;et them&s;elves with emulation to court it, and employed every art in order to in&s;inuate them|&s;elves into her confidence. Each of them had &s;ome|thing meritorious, with regard to Elizabeth, to plead in his own behalf. Henry had offered her a retreat in his dominions, if the dread of her &s;i&s;ter's violence
<PB N="322" REF="011837_1160_0F9D896F2FA73030">
&s;hould force her to fly for &s;afety out of England. Philip had, by his powerful interce&s;&s;ion, prevented Mary from proceeding to the mo&s;t fatal extremities again&s;t her. Each of them endeavoured now, to avail him&s;elf of the circum&s;tances in his favour. Henry wrote to Elizabeth &s;oon after her acce&s;&s;ion, with the warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of regard and friend&s;hip. He repre&s;ented the war which had unhappily been kind|led between their kingdoms, not as a national quar|rel, but as the effect of Mary's blind partiality to her hu&s;band and fond compliance with all his wi&s;hes. He entreated her to di&s;engage her&s;elf from an alliance which had proved &s;o unfortunate to England, and to con&s;ent to a &s;eparate peace with him, without ming|ling her intere&s;ts with tho&s;e of Spain, from which they ought now to be altogether disjoined. Philip on the other hand, unwilling to lo&s;e his connection with England, the importance of which during a rupture with France he had &s;o recently experienced, not only vied with Henry in declarations of e&s;teem for Elizabeth, and in profe&s;&s;ions of his re&s;olution to cul|tivate the &s;tricte&s;t amity with her, but in order to confirm and perpetuate their union, he offered him|&s;elf to her in marriage, and undertook to procure a di&s;pen&s;ation from the Pope to that effect.</P>
<P>ELIZABETH weighed the propo&s;als of the two Monarchs attentively, and with that provident di&s;|cernment of her true intere&s;t which was con&s;picuous in all her deliberations. She gave &s;ome encourage|ment to Henry's overture of a &s;eparate negotiation, becau&s;e it opened a channel of corre&s;pondence with France, which &s;he might find to be of great advan|tage, if Philip &s;hould not di&s;cover &s;ufficient zeal and &s;olicitude for &s;ecuring to her proper terms in the joint treaty. But &s;he ventured on this with the utmo&s;t re&s;erve and caution, that &s;he might not alarm Philip's &s;u&s;picious temper, and lo&s;e an ally in attemping to gain an ene|my<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Forbes i. p. 4.</NOTE>. Henry him&s;elf, by an unpardonable act of indi&s;cre|tion, prevented her from carrying her intercour&s;e with him to &s;uch a length as might have offended or alienated Philip. At the very time he was courting Elizabeth's

friend&s;hip with the greate&s;t a&s;&s;iduity, he yielded with an incon&s;iderate facility to the &s;olicitations of the Princes of Lorrain, and allowed his daughter-in-law the Queen of Scots to a&s;&s;ume the title and arms of England. This ill-timed preten&s;ion, the &s;ource of many calamities to the unfortunate Queen of Scots, extingui&s;hed at once all the confidence that might have grown between Henry and Elizabeth, and left in its place di&s;tru&s;t, re|&s;entment and antipathy. Elizabeth found that &s;he mu&s;t unite her intere&s;ts clo&s;ely with Philip's, and ex|pect peace only from negociations carried on in con|junction with him<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Strype's Annals of the Reformation, i. 11.

<P>AS &s;he had granted a commi&s;&s;ion, immediately af|ter her acce&s;&s;ion, to the &s;ame plenipotentiaries whom her &s;i&s;ter had employed, &s;he now in&s;tructed them to act in every point in concert with the plenipotentiaries of Spain, and to take no &s;tep until they had previou&s;ly con&s;ulted with them <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Forbes full view, i. 1. 37, 40.</NOTE>. But though &s;he deemed it prudent to a&s;&s;ume this appearance of confidence in the Spani&s;h Monarch, &s;he knew preci&s;ely how far to carry it; and di&s;covered no inclination to accept of that extraordinary propo&s;al of marriage which Philip had made to her. The Engli&s;h had expre&s;&s;ed &s;o openly the dete&s;tation of her &s;i&s;ter's choice of him, that it would have been highly imprudent to have exa&s;pe|rated them by renewing that odious alliance. She was too well acquainted with Philip's har&s;h imperious temper, to think of him for a hu&s;band. Nor could &s;he admit a di&s;pen&s;ation from the Pope to be &s;ufficient to authorize her marrying him, without condemning her father's divorce from Catherine of Aragon, and acknowledging of con&s;equence that her mother's mar|riage was null and her own birth illegitimate. But though &s;he determined not to yield to Philip's ad|dre&s;&s;es, the &s;ituation of her affairs rendered it dange|rous to reject them; &s;he returned her an&s;wer, there|fore, in terms which were eva&s;ive, but &s;o tempered with re&s;pect, that though they gave him no rea&s;on to be &s;ecure of &s;ucce&s;s, they did not altogether extin|gui&s;h his hopes.</P>
<P>BY this artifice, as well as by the prudence with
<PB N="324" REF="011837_1162_0F9D8970B11C0968">
which &s;he concealed her &s;entiments and intentions con|cerning religion, for &s;ome time after her acce&s;&s;ion, &s;he &s;o far gained upon Philip, that he warmly e&s;pou&s;ed her intere&s;t in the conferences which were renewed at Cercamp, and afterwards removed to Chateau-Cam|bre&s;is. A definitive treaty, which was to adju&s;t the claims and preten&s;ions of &s;o many Princes, required the examination of &s;uch a variety of intricate points, and led to &s;uch infinite and minute details, as drew out the negociations to a great length. But the Con|&s;table Montmorency exerted him&s;elf with &s;uch indefa|tigable zeal and indu&s;try, repairing alternately to the courts of Paris and Bru&s;&s;els, in order to obviate or re|move every difficulty, that all points in di&s;pute were adju&s;ted, at length, in &s;uch a manner, as to give en|tire &s;atisfaction, in every particular, to Henry and Philip; and the la&s;t hand was ready to be put to the treaty between them.</P>
<P>THE claims of England remained as the only ob&s;ta|cle to retard it. Elizabeth demanded the re&s;titution of Calais, in the mo&s;t preremptory tone, as an e&s;&s;en|tial condition of her con&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ting to peace; Henry re|fu&s;ed to give up that important conque&s;t; and both &s;eemed to have taken their re&s;olution with unalterable firmne&s;s. Philip warmly &s;upported Elizabeth's pre|ten&s;ions to Calais, not merely from a principle of equi|ty towards the Engli&s;h nation, that he might appear to have contributed to their recovering what they had lo&s;t by e&s;pou&s;ing his cau&s;e; nor &s;olely with a view of &s;oothing Elizabeth by this manife&s;tation of zeal for her intere&s;t; but in order to render France le&s;s for|midable, by &s;ecuring to her ancient enemy this ea&s;y acce&s;s into the heart of the kingdom. The earne&s;t|ne&s;s, however, with which he &s;econded the arguments of the Engli&s;h plenipotentiaries, &s;oon began to relax. During the cour&s;e of the negociation, Elizabeth, who now felt her&s;elf firmly &s;eated on the throne, began to take &s;uch open and vigorous mea&s;ures not only for o|verturning all that her &s;i&s;ter had done in favour of po|pery, but for e&s;tabli&s;hing the prote&s;tant church on a firm foundation, as convinced Philip that his hopes of an union with her had been from the beginning vain,
<PB N="325" REF="011837_1163_0F9D897175638E88">
and were now de&s;perate. From that period, his in|terpo&s;itions in her favour became more cold and formal, flowing merely from regard to decorum, or from the con&s;ideration of remote political intere&s;ts. Elizabeth having rea&s;on to expect &s;uch an alteration in his conduct, quickly perceived it. But as nothing would have been of greater detriment to her people, or more incon&s;i&s;tent with her &s;chemes of dome&s;tick ad|mini&s;tration, than the continuance of a war with France, &s;he &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ubmitting to &s;uch conditions as the &s;ituation of her affairs impo&s;ed, and that &s;he mu&s;t lay her account with being de&s;erted by an ally who was now united to her by a very feeble tie, if &s;he did not &s;peedily reduce her demands to what was moderate and attainable. She accordingly gave new in&s;tructions to her amba&s;&s;adors; and Philip's plenipo|tentiaries acting as mediators between the French and them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Forbes, i. 50.</NOTE>, an expedient was fallen on, which ju&s;tified, in &s;ome degree, Elizabeth's departing from the ri|gour of her fir&s;t demand with regard to Calais. All le&s;&s;er articles were &s;ettled without much di&s;cu&s;&s;ion or delay. Philip, that he might not appear to have abandoned the Engli&s;h, in&s;i&s;ted that the treaty be|tween Henry and Elizabeth &s;hould be concluded in form, before that between the French monarch and him. The one was &s;igned on the &s;econd day of April, the other on the day following.</P>
<P>THE treaty of peace between France and England contained no articles of real importance, but that which re&s;pected Calais. It was &s;tipulated that the King of France &s;hould retain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that town, with all its dependencies, during eight years; that, at the expiration of that term, he &s;hould re&s;tore it to England; that in ca&s;e of non-performance, he &s;hould forfeit five hundred thou&s;and crowns, for the pay|ment of which &s;um, &s;even or eight wealthy merchants, who were not his &s;ubjects, &s;hould grant &s;ecurity; that five per&s;ons of di&s;tinction &s;hould be given as ho&s;tages till that &s;ecurity were provided; that, although the forfeit of five hundred thou&s;and crowns &s;hould be paid, the right of England to Calais &s;hould &s;till remain
<PB N="326" REF="011837_1164_0F9D8972304A6188">
entire, in the &s;ame manner as if the term of eight years were expired; that the King and Queen of Scotland &s;hould be included in the treaty; that if they, or the French King, &s;hould violate the peace by any ho&s;tile action, Henry &s;hould be obliged in&s;tantly to re&s;tore Calais; that on the other hand, if any breach of the treaty proceeded from Elizabeth, then Henry and the King and Queen of Scots were ab&s;olved from all the engagements which they had come under by this treaty.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the &s;tudied attention with which &s;o many precautions were taken, it is evident that Henry did not intend the re&s;titution of Calais, nor is it probable that Elizabeth expected it. It was hardly po&s;&s;ible that &s;he could maintain, during the cour&s;e of eight years, &s;uch perfect concord both with France and Scotland, as not to afford Henry &s;ome pretext for alledging that &s;he had violated the treaty. But even if that term &s;hould elap&s;e without any ground for complaint, Henry might then chu&s;e to pay the &s;um &s;tipulated, and Elizabeth had no method of a&s;&s;erting her right but by force of arms. However, by throwing the articles in the treaty with regard to Calais into this form, Elizabeth &s;atisfied her &s;ubjects of every denomination; &s;he gave men of di&s;cernment a &s;triking proof of her addre&s;s, in palliating what &s;he could not prevent; and amu&s;ed the multitude, to whom the final &s;urrender of a place of &s;uch import|ance would have appeared altogether infamous, with the pro&s;pect of recovering in a &s;hort time that favour|ite po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE expedient which Montmorency employed, in order to facilitate the conclu&s;ion of peace between France and Spain, was the negociating two treaties of marriage, one between Elizabeth, Henry's elde&s;t daughter, and Philip, who &s;upplanted his &s;on, the unfortunate Don Carlos, to whom that Prince&s;s had been promi&s;ed in the former conferences at Cercamp, the other between Margaret, Henry's only &s;i&s;ter, and the duke of Savoy. For feeble as the ties of blood of|ten are among Princes, or how little &s;oever they may regard them when pu&s;hed on to act by motives of
<PB N="327" REF="011837_1165_0F9D8972F0247680">
ambition they a&s;&s;ume on other occa&s;ions the appearance of being &s;o far influenced by the&s;e dome&s;tick affections, as to employ them to ju&s;tify mea&s;ures and conce&s;&s;ions which they find to be nece&s;&s;ary, but know to be impolitic or di&s;honourable. Such was the u&s;e Henry made of the two marriages to which he gave his con&s;ent. Having &s;ecured an honourable e&s;tabli&s;hment for his &s;i&s;ter and his daughter, he, in con&s;ideration of the&s;e, granted terms both to Philip and the Duke of Savoy, of which he would not, on any other account, have ventured to approve.</P>
<P>THE principal articles in the treaty between France and Spain were, That a &s;incere and perpetual amity &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed between the two crowns and their re&s;pective allies; that the two monarchs &s;hould labour in concert to procure the convocation of a ge|neral council, in order to check the progre&s;s of here&s;y, and re&s;tore unity and concord to the Chri&s;tian church; that all conque&s;ts made by either party, on this &s;ide of the Alps, &s;ince the commencement of the war in one thou&s;and five hundred and fifty-one, &s;hould be mutually re&s;tored; that the dutchy of Savoy, the principality of Piedmont, the country of Bre&s;&s;e, and all the other territories formerly &s;ubject to the dukes of Savoy, &s;hould be re&s;tored to Emanuel Philibert, im|mediately after the celebration of his marriage with Margaret of France, the towns of Turin, Quiers, Pignerol, Chivaz and Villanova excepted, of which Henry &s;hould keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion until his claims on that Prince, in right of his grand-mother, &s;hould be heard and decided in cour&s;e of law; that as long as Henry retained the&s;e places in his hands, Philip &s;hould be at liberty to keep garri&s;ons in the towns of Vercelli and A&s;ti; that the French King &s;hould immediately eva|cuate all the places which he held in Tu&s;cany and the Siene&s;e, and renounce all future preten&s;ions to them; that he &s;hould re&s;tore the Marqui&s;ate of Montferrat to the duke of Mantua; that he &s;hould receive the Genoe&s;e into favour, and give up to them the towns which he had conquered in the i&s;land of Cor&s;ica; that none of the Princes or &s;tates, to whom the&s;e ce&s;&s;ions were made, &s;hould call their &s;ubjects to account for

any part of their conduct while under the dominion of their enemies, but &s;hould bury all pa&s;t tran&s;actions in oblivion. The Pope, the Emperor, the Kings of Denmark, Sweden, Poland, Portugal, the King and Queen of Scots, and almo&s;t every Prince and &s;tate in Chri&s;tendom, were comprehended in this pacification as the allies either of Henry or of Philip<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Recuell des Traitez, t. ii. 287.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THUS, by this famous treaty, peace was re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in Europe. All the cau&s;es of di&s;cord which had &s;o long embroiled the powerful monarchs of France and Spain, which had tran&s;mitted hereditary quarrels and wars from Charles to Philip, and from Francis to Henry, &s;eemed to be wholly removed, or finally terminated: The French alone complained of the unequal conditions of a treaty, into which an am|bitious mini&s;ter, in order to recover his liberty, and an artful mi&s;tre&s;s, than &s;he might gratify her re&s;ent|ment, had &s;educed their too ea&s;y monarch. They exclaimed loudly again&s;t the folly of giving up to the enemies of France, an hundred and eighty-nine fortified places in the Low-Countries or in Italy, in return for the three in&s;ignificant towns of St. Quin|tin, Ham and Catelet. They con&s;idered it as an in|delible &s;tain upon the glory of the nation, to renounce in one day territories &s;o exten&s;ive, and &s;o capable of being defended, that the enemy could not have hoped to wre&s;t them out of their hands, after many years of victory and &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT Henry, without regarding the &s;entiments of his people, or being moved by the remon&s;trances of his council, ratified the treaty, and executed with great fidelity whatever he had &s;tipulated to perform. The duke of Savoy repaired with a numerous retinue to Paris, in order to celebrate his marrriage with Henry's &s;i&s;ter.

&s;ingular and tragical accident. His &s;on, Francis II. a Prince under age of a feeble con&s;titution, and of a mind &s;till weaker, &s;ucceeded him. Soon after Paul ended his violent and imperious Pontificate, at en|mity with all the world, and di&s;gu&s;ted even with own nephews. They, per&s;ecuted by Philip, and de&s;erted by the &s;ucceeding Pope, whom they had rai&s;ed by their influence to the Papal throne, were condemned to the puni&s;hment which their crimes and ambition had merited, and their death was as infamous, as their lives had been criminal. Thus all the per&s;onages, who had long &s;u&s;tained the principal characters on the great theatre of Europe, di&s;appeared about the &s;ame time. A more known period of hi&s;tory opens at this aera; other actors appear on the &s;tage, with different views and different pa&s;&s;ions; new conte&s;ts aro&s;e, and new &s;chemes of ambition occupied and di&s;quieted mankind.</P>
<P>UPON reviewing the tran&s;actions of any active pe|riod, in the hi&s;tory of civilized nations, the changes which are accompli&s;hed appear wonderfully di&s;propor|tioned to the efforts which have been exerted. Con|que&s;ts are never very exten&s;ive or rapid, but among nations, who&s;e progre&s;s in improvement is extremely unequal. When Alexander the Great, at the head of a gallant people, of &s;imple manners, and formed to war by admirable military in&s;titutions, invaded a &s;tate &s;unk in luxury, and enervated by exce&s;&s;ive re|finement; when Genchizcan and Tamerlane, with their armies of hardy barbarians, poured in upon na|tions enfeebled by the climate in which they lived, or by the arts and commerce which they cultivated, they like a torrent, &s;wept every thing before them, &s;ub|duing kingdoms and provinces in as &s;hort &s;pace of time as was requi&s;ite to march through them. But when nations are in a &s;imilar &s;tate, and keep pace with each other in their advances towards refinement, they are not expo&s;ed to the calamity of &s;udden con|que&s;t. Their acqui&s;itions of knowledge, their pro|gre&s;s in the art of war, their political &s;agacity and ad|dre&s;s, are nearly equal. The fate of &s;tates in this &s;itu|ation, depends not on a &s;ingle battle. Their internal
<PB N="330" REF="011837_1168_0F9D897530CE3788">
re&s;ources are many and various. Nor are they them|&s;elves alone intere&s;ted in their own &s;afety, or active in their own defence. Other &s;tates interpo&s;e, and ba|lance any temporary advantage which either party may have acquired. After the fierce&s;t and mo&s;t lengthen|ed conte&s;t, all the rival nations are exhau&s;ted, none are conquered. At length a peace is concluded, which re-in&s;tates each in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of almo&s;t the &s;ame power, and the &s;ame territories.</P>
<P>SUCH was the &s;tate of Europe during the reign of Charles V. No Prince was &s;o much &s;uperior to the re&s;t in power, as to render his efforts irre&s;i&s;tible, and his conque&s;ts ea&s;y. No nation had made progre&s;s in improvement &s;o far beyond its neighbours, as to have acquired a very manife&s;t pre-eminence. Each &s;tate derived &s;ome advantage, or was &s;ubject to &s;ome in|convenience, from its &s;ituation or its climate; each was di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;omething peculiar in the genius of its people, or the con&s;titution of its government, But the advantages po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by one, were counter-balanced by circum&s;tances favourable to others; and this prevented any from attaining &s;uch &s;uperiority as might have been fatal to all. The nations of Europe in that age, as in the pre&s;ent, were like one great fa|mily; there were &s;ome features common to all, which fixed a re&s;emblance; there were certain peculiarities con&s;picuous in each, which marked a di&s;tinction. But there was not among them that wide diver&s;ity of character and of genius which, in almo&s;t every period of hi&s;tory, hath exalted the Europeans above the in|habitants of the other quarters of the globe, and &s;eems to have de&s;tined the one to rule, and the other to obey.</P>
<P>BUT though the near re&s;emblance and equality in improvement among the different nations of Europe, prevented the reign of Charles V. from being di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by &s;uch &s;udden and exten&s;ive conque&s;ts, as occur in &s;ome other periods of hi&s;tory, yet, during the cour&s;e of his admini&s;tration, all the con&s;iderable &s;tates in Europe &s;uffered a remarkable change in their political &s;ituation, and felt the influence of events, which have not hitherto &s;pent their force, but &s;till
<PB N="331" REF="011837_1169_0F9D8975EE818C50">
continue to operate in a greater or in a le&s;s degree. It was during his reign, and in con&s;equence of the per|petual efforts to which his enterprizing ambition rouzed them, that the different kingdoms of Europe acquired internal vigour, that they di&s;cerned the re|&s;ources of which they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, that they came both to feel their own &s;trength, and to know how to render it formidable to others. It was during his reign, too, that the different kingdoms of Europe, formerly &s;ingle and disjoined, became &s;o thoroughly acquainted, and &s;o intimately connected with each other, as to form one great political &s;y&s;tem, in which each took a &s;tation, wherein it has remained &s;ince that time with le&s;s variation, than could have been ex|pected after the events of two active centuries.</P>
<P>THE progre&s;s, however, and acqui&s;itions of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, were not only greater than tho&s;e of any other power, but more di&s;cernible and con&s;picu|ous. I have already enumerated the va&s;t territories which de&s;cended to Charles from his Au&s;trian, Bur|gundian, and Spani&s;h ance&s;tors <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. p, 331</NOTE>. To the&s;e he him|&s;elf added the Imperial dignity; and, as if all this had been too little, the bounds of the univer&s;e were ex|tended, and a new world &s;ubjected to his command. Upon his re&s;ignation, the Burgundian provinces, and the Spani&s;h kingdoms with their dependencies, both in the old and new worlds, devolved to Philip. But Charles tran&s;mitted his dominions to his &s;on, in a condition very different from that in which he had received them. They were augmented by the acce&s;|&s;ion of new provinces; they were habituated to obey an admini&s;tration which was no le&s;s vigorous than &s;teady; they were accu&s;tomed to expen&s;ive and per&s;e|vering efforts, which, though nece&s;&s;ary in the con|te&s;ts between civilized nations, had been little known in Europe before the &s;ixteenth century. The provin|ces of Frie&s;land, Utrecht and Overy&s;&s;el, which he ac|quired by purcha&s;e from their former proprietors, and the dutchy of Gelders, of which he made him&s;elf ma&s;ter, partly by force of arms, and partly by the
<PB N="332" REF="011837_1170_0F9D8976B2D6BD70">
arts of negociation, were additions of great value to his Burgundian dominions. Ferdinand and I&s;abella had tran&s;mitted to him all the provinces of Spain, from the bottom of the Pyrenees to the frontiers of Portu|gal; but as he maintained a perpetual peace with that kingdom, amid&s;t the various efforts of his enterpriz|ing ambition, he made no acqui&s;ition of territory in that quarter.</P>
<P>CHARLES had gained, however, a va&s;t acce&s;&s;ion of power in this part of his dominions. By this &s;ucce&s;s in the war with the commons of Ca&s;tile, he exalted the regal prerogative on the ruins of the privileges of the people. Though he allowed the name of the Cor|tes to remain, and the formality of holding it to be continued, he reduced its authority and juri&s;diction to nothing, and modelled it in &s;uch a manner, that it became rather a junto of the &s;ervants of the crown, than an a&s;&s;embly of the repre&s;entatives of the people. One member of the con&s;titution being thus lopped off, it was impo&s;&s;ible but that the other mu&s;t feel the &s;troke, and &s;uffer by it. The &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the popular pow|er rendered the ari&s;tocratical le&s;s formidable. The grandees, prompted by the warlike &s;pirit of the age, or allured by the honours which they enjoyed in a court, exhau&s;ted their fortunes in military &s;ervice, or in attending on the per&s;on of their Prince. They did not dread, perhaps did not ob&s;erve, the dange|rous progre&s;s of the royal authority, which leaving them the vain di&s;tinction of being covered in pre&s;ence of their &s;overeign, &s;tripped them by degrees of that real power which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed while they formed one body, and acted in concert with the people. Charles's &s;ucce&s;s in aboli&s;hing the privileges of the commons, and in breaking the power of the nobles of Ca&s;tile, encouraged Philip to invade the liberties of Aragon, which were &s;till more exten&s;ive. The Ca&s;ti|lians, accu&s;tomed to &s;ubjection them&s;elves, a&s;&s;i&s;ted in impo&s;ing the yoke on their more happy and indepen|dant neighbours. The will of the &s;overeign became the &s;upreme law in all the kingdoms of Spain; and Princes who were not checked in their plans by the jealou&s;y of the people, nor controuled in the execut|ing
<PB N="333" REF="011837_1171_0F9D89777354B388">
them by the power of the nobles, could both aim at great objects and call forth the whole &s;trength of the monarchy in order to attain them.</P>
<P>AS Charles, by extending the regal prerogative, rendered the monarchs of Spain ma&s;ters at home, he added new dignity and power to their crown by his foreign acqui&s;itions. He &s;ecured to Spain the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the kingdom of Naples, which Ferdinand had u&s;urped by fraud, and held with difficulty. He united the dutchy of Milan, one of the mo&s;t fertile and populous provinces in Italy, to the Spani&s;h crown; and left his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, even without taking their other territories into the account, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Princes in that country, which had been long the theatre of contention to the great powers of Europe, and in which they had &s;truggled with emulation to obtain the &s;uperiority. When the French, in con&s;e|quence of the treaty of Chateau-Cambre&s;is, withdrew their forces out of Italy, and finally relinqui&s;hed all their &s;chemes of conque&s;t on that &s;ide of the Alps, the Spani&s;h dominions there ro&s;e in importance, and en|abled their Kings, as long as the monarchy retained any degree of vigour, to pre&s;erve the chief &s;way in all the tran&s;actions of that country. But whatever ac|ce&s;&s;ion either of interior authority or of foreign domi|nion Charles gained for the monarchs of Spain in Europe, it was incon&s;iderable when compared with his acqui&s;itions in the new world. He added, there, not provinces, but empires to his crown. He con|quered territories of &s;uch immen&s;e extent; he di&s;co|vered &s;uch inexhau&s;tible veins of wealth, and opened &s;uch boundle&s;s pro&s;pects of every kind, as mu&s;t have rouzed and called forth to action his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, though his ambition had been much le&s;s ardent than Philip's and mu&s;t have rendered him not only enterprizing but formidable.</P>
<P>WHILE the elder branch of the Au&s;trian family ro&s;e to &s;uch pre-eminence in Spain, the younger of which Ferdinand was the head, grew to be con&s;idera|ble in Germany. The ancient hereditary dominions of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria in Germany, united to the kingdoms of Hungary and Bohemia, which Ferdi|nand
<PB N="334" REF="011837_1172_0F9D89785CEACD30">
had acquired by marriage, formed a re&s;pectable power, and when the Imperial dignity was added to the&s;e, Ferdinand po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed territories more exten&s;ive than had belonged to any Prince, Charles V. except|ed, who had been at the head of the Empire during &s;everal ages. Fortunately for Europe, the di&s;gu&s;t which Philip conceived, on account of Ferdinand's refu&s;ing to relinqui&s;h the Imperial crown in his favour not only prevented for &s;ome time the &s;eparate mem|bers of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria from acting in concert, but occa&s;ioned a vi&s;ible alienation and rival&s;hip. By degrees, however, regard to the intere&s;t of their fa|mily extingui&s;hed this impolitic animo&s;ity. The con|fidence which was natural returned; the aggrandiz|ing of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria became the common object of all their &s;chemes; they gave and received a&s;&s;i&s;tance alternately towards the execution of them; and each derived con&s;ideration and importance from the other's &s;ucce&s;s. A family &s;o great and &s;o a&s;piring became the general object of jealou&s;y and terror. All the power as well as policy of Europe were exerted dur|ing a century, in order to check and humble it. No|thing can give a more &s;triking idea of the a&s;cendant which it had acquired, and of the terror which it had in&s;pired, than that after its vigour was &s;pent with ex|traordinary exertions of its &s;trength, after Spain was become only the &s;hadow of a great name, and its monarchs were &s;unk into debility and dotage, the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria &s;till continued to be formidable. The nations of Europe had &s;o often felt its &s;uperior power, and had been &s;o con&s;tantly employed in guarding again&s;t it, that the dread of it became a kind of political habit, the influence of which remained when the cau&s;es, which had formed it, cea&s;ed to exi&s;t.</P>
<P>WHILE the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria went on with &s;uch &s;uc|ce&s;s in enlarging its dominions, France made no incon&s;i|derable acqui&s;ition of new territory. All its &s;chemes of conque&s;t in Italy had proved abortive; it had hi|therto obtained no e&s;tabli&s;hment of con&s;equence in the new world; and after the continued and vigorous efforts of four &s;ucce&s;&s;ive reigns, the confines of the
<PB N="335" REF="011837_1173_0F9D8978EE4CC498">
kingdom were much the &s;ame as Louis XI. had left them. But though France made not &s;uch large &s;trides towards dominion as the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, it continued to advance by &s;teps which were more &s;e|cure, becau&s;e they were gradual and le&s;s ob&s;erved. The conque&s;t of Calais put it out of the power of the Engli&s;h to invade France but at their utmo&s;t peril, and delivered the French from the dread of their ancient enemies, who, previous to that event, could at any time penetrate into the kingdom by that avenue, and thereby retard or defeat the execution of their be&s;t concerted enterprizes again&s;t any foreign power. The important acqui&s;ition of Metz covered that part of their frontier which formerly was mo&s;t feeble, and lay mo&s;t expo&s;ed to in&s;ult. France, from the time of its obtaining the&s;e additional &s;ecurities again&s;t exter|nal inva&s;ion, mu&s;t be deemed the mo&s;t powerful king|dom in Europe, and is more fortunately &s;ituated than any on the continent, either for conque&s;ts or defence. From the confines of Artois to the bottom of the Py|renees, and from the Briti&s;h channel to the frontiers of Savoy and the coa&s;t of the Mediterranean, its ter|ritories lay compact and unmingled with tho&s;e of any other power. Several of the con&s;iderable provinces, which, by their having been long &s;ubject to the great va&s;&s;als of the crown, who were often at variance or at war with their ma&s;ter, had contracted a &s;pirit of in|dependance, were now accu&s;tomed to recognize and to obey one &s;overeign. As they became members of the &s;ame monarchy, they a&s;&s;umed the &s;entiments of that body into which they were incorporated, and co|operated with zeal towards promoting its intere&s;t and honour. The power and influence wre&s;ted from the nobles were &s;eized by the crown. The people were not admitted to &s;hare in the&s;e &s;poils; they gained no new privilege; they acquired no additional weight in the legi&s;lator. It was not for the &s;ake of the people, but in order to extend their own prerogative, that the monarchs of France had laboured to humble their great va&s;&s;als. Satisfied with having brought them un|der entire &s;ubjection to the crown, they di&s;covered no &s;olicitude to free the people from their ancient de|pendance on the nobles of whom they held.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="011837_1174_0F9D8979B12734C8">A MONARCH, at the head of a kingdom thus united at home and &s;ecure from abroad, was entitled to form great de&s;igns, becau&s;e he felt him&s;elf in a condition to execute them. The foreign wars which had continu|ed with little interruption from the acce&s;&s;ion of Charles VIII. had not only cheri&s;hed and augmented the martial genius of the nation, but by inuring the troops during the cour&s;e of long &s;ervice to the fatigues of war, and accu&s;toming them to obedience, had ad|ded the force of di&s;cipline to their natural order. A gallant and active body of nobles who con&s;idered them|&s;elves as idle and u&s;ele&s;s, unle&s;s when they were in the field; who were &s;carce acquainted with any pa&s;time or exerci&s;e but what was military; and who knew no road to power, or fame, or wealth, but war, would not have &s;uffered their &s;overeign to remain long in inaction. The people, little acquainted with the arts of peace, and always ready to take arms at the com|mand of their &s;uperiors, were accu&s;tomed by the va&s;t expence of long wars, carried on in di&s;tant countries, to bear impo&s;itions, which, how incon&s;iderable &s;o|ever they may &s;eem if e&s;timated by the exorbitant rate of modern actions, appear immen&s;e when compared with the &s;ums levied in France, or in any other coun|try of Europe, previous to the reign of Louis XI. As all the members of which the &s;tate was compo&s;ed were thus impatient for action, and capable of great efforts, the &s;chemes and operations of France mu&s;t have been no le&s;s formidable to Europe than tho&s;e of Spain. The &s;uperior advantages of its &s;ituation, the contiguity and compactne&s;s of its territories, together with the peculiar &s;tate of its political con&s;titution at that juncture mu&s;t have rendered its enterprizes &s;till more alarming and more dece&s;ive. The King po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed &s;uch a degree of power as gave him the entire command of his &s;ubjects; the people were &s;trangers to tho&s;e occupations and habits of life which render men aver&s;e to war, or unfit for it; and the nobles, though reduced to &s;ubordination nece&s;&s;ary in a regu|lar government, &s;till retained the high undaunted &s;pirit which was the effect of their ancient indepen|dence. The vigour of the Feudal times remained,
<PB N="337" REF="011837_1175_0F9D897A71BA3D68">
their anarchy was at an end; and the Kings of France could avail them&s;elves of the martial ardour which that &s;ingular in&s;titution had kindled or kept alive, without being expo&s;ed to any of the dangers or in|conveniencies which are in&s;eparable from it when in intire force.</P>
<P>A KINGDOM in &s;uch a &s;tate is, perhaps, capable of greater military efforts, than at any other period in its progre&s;s. But how formidable &s;oever or fatal to the other nations of Europe, the power of &s;uch a monarchy might have been, the civil wars which broke out in France, &s;aved them at that juncture from feeling its effects. The&s;e wars, of which religi|on was the pretext and ambition the cau&s;e; wherein great abilities were di&s;played by the leaders of the dif|ferent factions, and little conduct or firmne&s;s were manife&s;ted by the crown under a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of weak Princes, kept France occupied and embroiled for half a century. During the&s;e commotions, the internal &s;trength of the kingdom was much wa&s;ted, and &s;uch a &s;pirit of anarchy was &s;pread among the nobles, to whom rebellion was familiar, and the re&s;traint of laws unknown, that a con&s;iderable interval became requi|&s;ite, not only for recruiting the internal vigour of the nation, but for re-e&s;tabli&s;hing the authority of the Prince; &s;o that it was long before France could turn her whole attention towards foreign tran&s;actions, or act with her proper force in foreign wars. It was long before &s;he ro&s;e to that a&s;cendant in Europe, which &s;he has maintained &s;ince the admini&s;tration of Cardinal Richlieu, and which the &s;ituation as well as extent of the kingdom, the nature of her govern|ment, and the character of her people, entitle her to maintain.</P>
<P>WHILE the kingdoms on the continent grew into power and con&s;equence, England likewi&s;e made con|&s;iderable progre&s;s towards regular government and in|terior &s;trength. Henry VIII. probably without inten|tion, and certainly without any con&s;i&s;tent plan, of which his nature was incapable, pur&s;ued the &s;cheme
<PB N="338" REF="011837_1176_0F9D897B31F8D4D8">
of depre&s;&s;ing the nobility, which the policy of his fa|ther Henry VII. had begun. The pride and caprice of his temper led him to employ chiefly new men in the admini&s;tration of affairs, becau&s;e he found them mo&s;t ob&s;equious, or lea&s;t &s;crupulous; and he not on|ly conferred on the&s;e &s;uch plenitude of power, but exalted them to &s;uch pre-eminence in dignity, as mor|tified and degraded the ancient nobility. By the ali|enation or &s;ale of the church lands, which were di&s;&s;i|pated with a profu&s;ion not inferior to the rapaciou&s;|ne&s;s with which they had been &s;eized, as well as by the privilege granted by the ancient landholders of &s;elling their e&s;tates, or di&s;po&s;ing of them by will, an immen&s;e property, formerly locked up, being brought into circulation, put the &s;pirit of indu&s;try and com|merce in motion, and gave it &s;ome con&s;iderable de|gree of vigour. The road to power and to opulence became open to per&s;ons of every condition. A &s;udden and exce&s;&s;ive flow of wealth from the We&s;t Indies proved fatal to indu&s;try in Spain; a moderate acce&s;&s;i|on in England to the &s;um in circulation gave life to commerce, awakened the ingenuity of the nation, and and excited it to u&s;eful enterprize. In France, what the nobles lo&s;t the crown gained. In England, the commons were gainers as well as the King. Power and influence accompanied of cour&s;e the property which they acquired. They ro&s;e to con&s;ideration a|mong their fellow &s;ubjects; they began to feel their own importance; and extending their influence in the legi&s;lative body gradually, and often when neither they them&s;elves nor others fore&s;aw all the effect of their claims and preten&s;ions, they at la&s;t attained that high authority, to which the Briti&s;h con&s;titution is indebted for the exi&s;tence, and mu&s;t owe the pre&s;er|vation of its liberty. At the &s;ame time that the En|gli&s;h con&s;titution advanced towards perfection, &s;eve|ral incidents brought on a change in the ancient &s;y&s;tem with re&s;pect to foreign powers, and introduced ano|ther more beneficial to the nation. By di&s;claiming the &s;upremacy and juri&s;diction of the Papal See, con|&s;iderable &s;ums were &s;aved to the nation, of which it had been annually drained, by remittances to Rome

<P>THE &s;ame principle which had led England to adopt this new &s;y&s;tem with regard to the powers on the con|tinent occa&s;ioned a change in its plan of conduct with re&s;pect to Scotland, the only foreign &s;tate, with

which, on account of its &s;ituation in the &s;ame i&s;land, the Engli&s;h had &s;uch a clo&s;e connection as demanded their perpetual attention. In&s;tead of pro&s;ecuting the ancient &s;cheme of conquering that kingdom, which the nature of the country, defended by a brave and hardy people, rendered dangerous if not impractica|ble; it appeared more eligible to endeavour at ob|taining &s;uch influence in Scotland as might exempt England from any danger or di&s;quiet from that quar|ter. The national poverty of the Scots, together with the violence and animo&s;ity of their factions ren|dered the execution of this plan ea&s;y to a people far &s;uperior to them in wealth. Their popular leaders were gained; the mini&s;ters and favourites of the crown were corrupted; and &s;uch ab&s;olute direction of their councils acquired, as rendered the operations of the one kingdom dependant in a great mea&s;ure on the &s;overeign of the other. Such perfect external &s;ecuri|ty added to the interior advantages which England now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, mu&s;t &s;oon have rai&s;ed it to new con&s;i|deration and importance; the long reign of Elizabeth, equally con&s;picuous for wi&s;dom, for &s;teadine&s;s, and for vigour, accelerated its progre&s;s, and carried it with greater rapidity towards that elevated &s;tation which it hath &s;ince held among the powers of Europe.</P>
<P>DURING the period in which the political &s;tate of the great kingdoms underwent &s;uch changes, revolu|tions of con&s;iderable importance happened in that of the &s;econdary or inferior powers. Tho&s;e in the Pa|pal court are mo&s;t obvious, and of more exten&s;ive con&s;equence.</P>
<P>IN the Preliminary Work, I have mentioned the ri&s;e of that &s;piritual juri&s;diction which the Popes claim as Vicars of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and have traced the progre&s;s of that authority which they po&s;&s;e&s;s as temporal Prin|ces <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. I. p. 99.</NOTE>. There was nothing previous to the reign of Charles V. that tended to circum&s;cribe or to moderate their authority, but &s;cience and philo&s;ophy, which began to revive and to be cultivated. The progre&s;s of the&s;e, however, was &s;till incon&s;iderable; they al|ways operate &s;lowly; and it is long before their influ|ence

reaches the people, or can produce any &s;en&s;ible effect upon them. They may perhaps gradually, and in along cour&s;e of years, undermine and &s;hake an e|&s;tabli&s;hed &s;y&s;tem of fal&s;e religion, but there is no in|&s;tance of their having overturned one. The battery is too feeble to demoli&s;h tho&s;e fabricks which &s;uper|&s;tition rai&s;es on deep foundations, and can &s;trengthen with the mo&s;t con&s;ummate art.</P>
<P>LUTHER had attacked the Papal &s;upremacy with o|ther weapons, and with an impetuo&s;ity more formi|dable. The time and manner of his attack concurred with a multitude of circum&s;tances, which have been explained, in giving him immediate &s;ucce&s;s. The charm which had bound mankind for &s;o many ages was broken at once. The human mind, which had continued long as tame and pa&s;&s;ive, as if it had been formed to believe whatever was taught, and to bear whatever was impo&s;ed, rou&s;ed of a &s;udden and became inqui&s;itive, mutinous, and di&s;dainful of the yoke to which it had hitherto &s;ubmitted. That wonderful ferment and agitation of mind, which, at this di&s;|tance of time, appears unaccountable or is condemned as extravagant, was &s;o general, that it mu&s;t have been excited by cau&s;es which were natural and of power|ful efficacy. The Kingdoms of Denmark, Sweden, England and Scotland, and almo&s;t one half of Germa|nany threw off their allegiance to the Pope, aboli&s;hed his juri&s;diction within their territories, and gave the &s;anction of law to modes of di&s;cipline and &s;y&s;tems of doctrine which were not only independant of his pow|er, but ho&s;tile to it. Nor was this &s;pirit of innovati|on confined to tho&s;e countries which openly revolted from the Pope; it &s;pread through all Europe, and broke out in every part of it with various degrees of violence. It penetrated early into France and made progre&s;s apace. The number of converts to the opini|ons of the Reformers was &s;o great, their zeal &s;o en|terprizing, and the abilities of their leaders &s;o di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, that they &s;oon ventured to contend for &s;u|periority with the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, and were &s;ome|times on the point of obtaining it. In all the provin|ces of Germany, which continued to acknowledge
<PB N="342" REF="011837_1180_0F9D897EF306CE20">
the Papal &s;upremacy, as well as in the Low-Coun|tries, the Prote&s;tant doctrines were &s;ecretly taught, and had gained &s;o many pro&s;elytes, that they were ripe for revolt, and were re&s;trained merely by the dread of their rulers from imitating the example of their neighbours, and a&s;&s;erting their independance. Even in Spain and in Italy, &s;ymptoms of the &s;ame di&s;po|&s;ition to &s;hake off the yoke appeared. The preten&s;i|ons of the Pope to infallible knowledge and &s;upreme power were treated by many per&s;ons of eminent learn|ing and abilities with &s;uch &s;corn, or impugned with &s;uch vehemence, that the mo&s;t vigilant attention of the civil magi&s;trate, the highe&s;t &s;trains of pontifical authority, and all the rigour of the inqui&s;itorial ju|ri&s;diction were requi&s;ite to check and extingui&s;h it.</P>
<P>THE defection of &s;o many opulent and powerful kingdoms from the Papal See, was a fatal blow to its grandeur and power. It abridged the dominions of the Popes in extent, it dimini&s;hed their revenues, and left them fewer rewards to be&s;tow on the eccle&s;i|a&s;tics of various denominations, attached to them by vows of obedience as well as by ties of intere&s;t, and whom they employed as in&s;truments to e&s;tabli&s;h or &s;upport their u&s;urpations in every part of Europe. The countries too which now di&s;claimed their autho|rity, were tho&s;e which formerly had been mo&s;t devot|ed to it. The empire of &s;uper&s;tition differs from every other &s;pecies of dominion; its power is often greate&s;t, and mo&s;t implicitly obeyed in the provinces mo&s;t re|mote from the &s;eat of government; while &s;uch as are &s;ituated nearer to that are more apt to di&s;cern the ar|tifices by which it is upheld, or the impo&s;tures on which it is founded. The per&s;onal frailities or vices of the Popes, the errors as well as corruption of their admini&s;tration, the ambition, venality and deceit which reigned in their court, fell immediately under the ob&s;ervation of the Italians, and could not fail of dimini&s;hing that re&s;pect which begets &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. But in Germany, England, and the more remote coun|tries, the&s;e were either altogether unknown, or be|ing only known by report, made a &s;lighter impre&s;&s;ion&punc;
<PB N="343" REF="011837_1181_0F9D897FB1CA23B8">
Their veneration for the Papal dignity increa&s;ed with their di&s;tance from Rome; and that, added to their gro&s;s ignorance, rendered them equally credulous and pa&s;&s;ive. In tracing the progre&s;s of the Papal do|mination, the bolde&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful in&s;tances of encroachment are to be found in Germany and other countries di&s;tant from Italy. In the&s;e its impo&s;itions were heavie&s;t, and its exactions the mo&s;t rapacious; &s;o that in e&s;timating the diminution of power which the court of Rome &s;uffered in con&s;equence of the Reformation, not only the number but the character of the people who revolted, not only the great extent of territory, but the extraordinary ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;ubjects which it lo&s;t, mu&s;t be taken into the account.</P>
<P>NOR was it only by this defection of &s;o many kingdoms and &s;tates which it occa&s;ioned, that the Reformation contributed to dimini&s;h the power of the Roman Pontiffs. It obliged them to adopt a different &s;y&s;tem of conduct towards the nations which continu|ed to recognize their juri&s;diction, and to govern them by new maxims and with a milder &s;pirit. The Reformation taught them, by a fatal example, what they &s;eem not before to have apprehended, that the credulity and patience of mankind might be overbur|dened and exhau&s;ted. They became afraid of ven|turing on any &s;uch exertion of their authority as might alarm or exa&s;perate their &s;ubjects, and excite them to a new revolt. They &s;aw a rival church e&s;tabli&s;hed in many countries of Europe, the members of which were on the watch to ob&s;erve any errors in their ad|mini&s;tration, and eager to expo&s;e them. They were &s;en&s;ible that the opinions adver&s;e to their power and u&s;urpations were not confined to their enemies alone, but had &s;pread even among the people who &s;till adher|ed to them. Upon all the&s;e accounts, it was no long|er po&s;&s;ible to lead and to govern their flock in the &s;ame manner as in tho&s;e dark and quiet ages, when faith was implicit, when &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion was unre&s;erved, and all tamely followed and obeyed the voice of their &s;hepherd. From the aera of the Reformation, the Popes have ruled rather by addre&s;s and management
<PB N="344" REF="011837_1182_0F9D89806E896420">
than by authority. The &s;tile of their decrees is the &s;ame, but the effect of them is very different. Tho&s;e Bulls and Interdicts which, before the Reformation, made the greate&s;t Princes tremble, have &s;ince that period been di&s;regarded or de&s;pi&s;ed by the mo&s;t in|con&s;iderable. Tho&s;e bold deci&s;ions and acts of juri&s;|diction which, during many ages, not only pa&s;&s;ed uncen&s;ured, but were revered as the awards of a &s;a|cred tribunal, would, &s;ince Luther's appearance, be treated by one part of of Europe as the effect of folly or arrogance, and be dete&s;ted by the other as impious and unju&s;t, The Popes, in their admini&s;tration, have been obliged not only to accommodate them&s;elves to the notions of their adherents, but to pay &s;ome re|gard to the prejudices of their enemies. They &s;eldom venture to claim new powers, or even to in&s;i&s;t ob&s;ti|nately on their ancient prerogatives, le&s;t they &s;hould irritate the former; they carefully avoid every mea|&s;ure that may either excite the indignation or draw on them the deri&s;ion of the latter. The policy of the court of Rome has become as cautious, circum&s;pect, and timid, as it was once adventurous and violent; and though their preten&s;ions to infallibility, on which all their authority is founded, does not allow them to renounce any juri&s;diction which they have at any time claimed or exerci&s;ed, they find it expedient to &s;uffer many of their prerogatives to lie dormant, and not to expo&s;e them&s;elves by ill-timed attempts towards reviving the&s;e, to the ri&s;que of lo&s;ing that remainder of power which they &s;till enjoy. Before the &s;ixteenth century, the Popes were the movers and directors in every con&s;iderable enterprize; they were at the head of every great alliance; and being con&s;idered as arbiters of the affairs of Chri&s;tendom, the court of Rome was the centre of political negociation and intrigue. From that time the greate&s;t operations in Europe have been carried on independant of them; they have &s;unk al|mo&s;t to a level with the other petty Princes of Italy; they continue to claim, though they dare not exer|ci&s;e, the &s;ame &s;piritual juri&s;diction, but &s;carce retain any &s;hadow of the temporal power which they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cient|ly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="011837_1183_0F9D898130773618">BUT how fatal &s;oever the Reformation may have been to the power of the Popes, it contributed to improve the church of Rome both in &s;cience and in morals. The de&s;ire of equalling the Reformers in tho&s;e talents which had procured them re&s;pect; the nece&s;&s;ity of acquiring the knowledge requi&s;ite for de|fending their own tenets, or refuting the arguments of their opponents; together with the emulation na|tural between two rival churches, engaged the Roman Catholic clergy to apply them&s;elves to the &s;tudy of u&s;eful &s;cience, which they cultivated with &s;uch a&s;&s;i|duity and &s;ucce&s;s, that they have gradually become as eminent in literature, as they were in &s;ome periods infamous for ignorance. The &s;ame principle occa&s;i|oned a change no le&s;s con&s;iderable in the manners of the clergy of the Romi&s;h church. Various cau&s;es which have formerly been enumerated, had concurred in introducing great irregularity, and even di&s;&s;olution of manners among the Popi&s;h clergy. Luther and his adherents began their attack on the church with &s;uch vehement invectives again&s;t the&s;e, that in order to remove the &s;candal, and &s;ilence their declamations, greater decency of conduct became nece&s;&s;ary. The Reformers them&s;elves were &s;o eminent not only for the purity but even au&s;terity of their manners, and had acquired &s;uch reputation among the people on that account, that the Roman Catholic Clergy mu&s;t have &s;oon lo&s;t all credit, if they had not endeavoured to conform in &s;ome mea&s;ure to their &s;tandard. They knew that all their actions fell under the &s;evere in&s;pection of the Prote&s;tants, whom enmity and emu|lation prompted to ob&s;erve every vice, or even im|propriety in their conduct; to cen&s;ure them without indulgence, and to expo&s;e them without mercy. This rendered them, of cour&s;e, not only cautious to avoid &s;uch enormities as might give offence, but &s;tudious to acquire the virtues that might merit prai&s;e. In Spain and Portugal, where the tyrannical juri&s;diction of the Inqui&s;ition cru&s;hed the Prote&s;tant faith as &s;oon as it appeared, the &s;pirit of Popery continues invaria|ble; &s;cience has made &s;mall progre&s;s, and the charac|ter of eccle&s;ia&s;tics has undergone little change. But
<PB N="346" REF="011837_1184_0F9D88C070AEEFB8">
in tho&s;e countries where the members of the two churches have mingled freely with each other, or have carried on any con&s;iderable intercour&s;e, either commercial or literary, an extraordinary alteration in the ideas as well as in the morals of the Popi&s;h ec|cle&s;ia&s;tics, is manife&s;t. In France, the manners of the Dignitaries and &s;ecular clergy have become decent and exemplary in an high degree. Many of them have been di&s;tingui&s;hed for all the accompli&s;hments and virtues which can adorn their profe&s;&s;ion; and dif|fer greatly from their predece&s;&s;ors before the Refor|mation, both in their maxims and in their conduct.</P>
<P>NOR has the influence of the Reformation been felt only by the inferior members of the Roman Catholick Church; it has extended to the See of Rome, to the &s;overeign Pontiffs them&s;elves. Violations of decorum, and even tre&s;pa&s;&s;es again&s;t morality, which pa&s;&s;ed without cen&s;ure in tho&s;e ages, when neither the pow|er of the Popes, nor the veneration of the people for their character, had any bounds; when there was no ho&s;tile eye to ob&s;erve the errors in their conduct, and no adver&s;aries zealous to inveigh again&s;t them; would be liable now to the &s;evere&s;t animadver&s;ion, and ex|cite general indignation or horror. In&s;tead of rivall|ing the courts of temporal Princes in gaiety, and &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ing them in licentiou&s;ne&s;s, the Popes have &s;tudied to a&s;&s;ume manners more &s;evere and more &s;uitable to their eccle&s;ia&s;tical character. The chair of St. Peter hath not been polluted, during two centuries, by any Pontiff that re&s;embled Alexander VI. or &s;everal of his predece&s;&s;ors, who were a di&s;grace to religion and to human nature. Throughout this long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Popes, a wonderful decorum of conduct, compared with that of preceding ages, is ob&s;ervable. Many of them have been con&s;picuous for the virtues becoming their high &s;tation; and by their humanity, their love of literature, and their moderation, have made &s;ome attonement to mankind for the crimes of their pre|dece&s;&s;ors. Thus the beneficial influences of the Re|formation have been more exten&s;ive than they appear on a &s;uperficial view; and this great divi&s;ion in the Chri&s;tian church hath contributed, in &s;ome mea&s;ure,

to encrea&s;e purity of manners, to diffu&s;e &s;cience, and to in&s;pire humanity.

<P>THE republick of Venice which, at the beginning of the &s;ixteenth century, had appeared &s;o formidable, that almo&s;t all the potentates of Europe united in a confederacy for its de&s;truction, declined gradually from its ancient power and &s;plendour. The Veneti|ans not only lo&s;t a great part of their territory in the war excited by the league of Cambray, but the reve|nues as well as vigour of the &s;tate were exhau&s;ted by their extraordinary and long continued efforts in their own defence; and that commerce by which they had ac|quired their wealth and power began to decay, with|out any hopes of its reviving. All the fatal con&s;equen|ces to their republick, which the &s;agacity of the Ve|netian &s;enate fore&s;aw on the fir&s;t di&s;covery of a pa&s;&s;age to the Ea&s;t-Indies by the Cape of Good Hope, took place.

Li&s;bon, in&s;tead of Venice, became the &s;taple for the precious commodities of the Ea&s;t. The Vene|tians, after having po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed for many years the mo|nopoly of that beneficial commerce, had the mortifi|cation to be excluded from almo&s;t any &s;hare in it. The di&s;coveries of the Spaniards in the we&s;tern world, proved no le&s;s fatal to inferior branches of their com|merce. The original defects which were formerly pointed out in the con&s;titution of the Venetian repub|lick continued, and the di&s;advantages with which it

undertook any great enterprize, increa&s;ed rather than dimini&s;hed. The &s;ources from which it derived its ex|traordinary riches and power being dried up, the in|terior vigour of the &s;tate declined, and of cour&s;e, ren|dered its external operations le&s;s formidable. Long before the middle of the &s;ixteenth century, Venice cea&s;ed to be one of the principal powers in Europe, and became a &s;econdary and &s;ubaltern &s;tate. But as the &s;enate had the addre&s;s to conceal its diminution of power, under the veil of moderation and caution; as it made no ra&s;h effort that could di&s;cover its impo|tence; as the &s;ymptoms of political decay, in &s;tates are not &s;oon ob&s;erved, and are &s;eldom &s;o apparent to their neighbours as to occa&s;ion any &s;udden alteration in their conduct towards them, Venice continued long to be con&s;idered and re&s;pected. She was treated not according to her pre&s;ent condition, but according to the rank which &s;he had formerly held. Charles, as well as the monarchs of France his rivals, courted her a&s;&s;i&s;tance with emulation and &s;olicitude in all their enterprizes. Even down to the clo&s;e of the century, Venice remained not only an object of attention, but a con&s;iderable &s;eat of political negociation and in|trigue.</P>
<P>THAT authority which the fir&s;t Co&s;mo de Medici, and Lawrence, his grand&s;on, had acquired in the re|publick of Florence by their beneficence and abilities, in&s;pired their de&s;cendants with the ambition of u&s;urp|ing the &s;overeignty in their country, and paved their way towards it. Charles placed Alexander de Medici at the head of the republick, and to the natural inte|re&s;t and power of the family added the weight and cre|dit of the Imperial protection. Of the&s;e, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or Co&s;mo, &s;irnamed the Great, availed him&s;elf; and e&s;ta|bli&s;hing his &s;upreme authority on the ruins of the ancient republican con&s;titution, he tran&s;mitted that, together with the title of Grand Duke of Tu&s;cany, to his de|&s;cendants.
