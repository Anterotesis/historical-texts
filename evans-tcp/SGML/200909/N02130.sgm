<HEAD>The <HI>Ruling</HI> and <HI>Ordaining</HI> POWER OF PRESBYTERS, DEFENDED In a LETTER, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Now return the <HI>Book</HI> you were pleas'd, the la&s;t Week, to leave with me; and together with Thanks, I &s;end you my <HI>Re|marks,</HI> upon &s;ome Part of it, in compliance to your De&s;ires. Upon peru&s;al of the Book, I find the main Body of it is in defence of <HI>Forms of Prayer,</HI> &amp; the <HI>Engli&s;h Liturgy;</HI> which being Things that have not &s;o immediate Reference to the Controver&s;y now o'foot among us, I think it be&s;t at pre&s;ent to pa&s;s them over, and to confine my &s;elf intirely within tho&s;e Pages that relate to EPISCOPACY. I remember your Propo&s;al was, that this Reply to Mr. <HI>Bar|clay</HI> &s;hou'd be manag'd &s;o as to &s;erve for an <HI>Ap|pendix</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="002531_0003_0FDB5BC6FA15E750">
to the late Letter of <HI>Sober Remarks</HI> on the <HI>Modest Proof;</HI> which put the Di&s;pute wholly on a <HI>Scripture-Fost.</HI> For this Rea&s;on, although what my Author has offer'd from the <HI>Fathers,</HI> would admit of an ea&s;y An&s;wer, yet I will take little or no notice of his Te&s;timonies from Them; but &s;hall limit my &s;elf to the Arguments he pre|tends to draw out of the BIBLE; which a famous <HI>Epi&s;copalian</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chillingw.</NOTE> well calls the <HI>Religion of Protestants.</HI> And here I don't intend to make Ob&s;ervations upon every little thing liable to Ex|ception in my Author: and as to Things Mate|terial, which I find have receiv'd a ju&s;t An&s;wer in the Letter of <HI>Sober Remarks,</HI> I de&s;ign but briefly to touch upon 'em: unle&s;s perhaps &s;ome <HI>new</HI> Thoughts may occur to me, proper to be added; which the Writer of that Letter did not &s;ee fit to take any Notice of.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Barclay</HI>'s Di&s;cour&s;e, which is now to come under Examination, begins at the 78th Page of his Book. Where, in the fir&s;t place, he lays down this, Propo&s;ition, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>"THAT the Government of</HI> CHRIST's <HI>Church was left by him&s;elf, and manag'd for the fir&s;t Three Centuries by &s;ome Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters of the Word and Sacraments, exerci&s;ing Authority and Juri&s;diction over others, who were <HI>Likewi&s;e</HI> Mini&s;ters of the Word and Sacraments".</HI></P>
<P>HERE not to take notice of any Soleci&s;ms in Grammar, or any thing el&s;e lyable to Exception, in the Propo&s;ition it &s;elf, I will come im|mediately to con&s;ider the Arguments he brings to &s;upport this A&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="002531_0004_0FDB5BC95B55A670">IN the fir&s;t place, I find him harping on the old thread-bare Argument from the 12 and the 70. Though here he &s;eems to yield to Presby|terians the Di&s;pute about the Superiority of the 12 to the 70, during our Savior's Life-time. At lea&s;t, (he &s;ays to us, <HI>to take you in your own way;</HI> a Phra&s;e I &s;hall have frequent occa&s;ion to borrow from him) he will for once <HI>&s;uppo&s;e</HI> that they were <HI>equal.</HI> But then he adds, pag. 79. <Q>If we can find a <HI>Second Superior Ordination</HI> given by our Savior to the <HI>Eleven,</HI> which the <HI>Seventy</HI> did not receive. I hope it will appear that the <HI>Eleven</HI> were of a <HI>higher Order,</HI> and had a greater Degree of Power in the Church than They.</Q> Now to evidence this, he turns us to <HI>Job.</HI> 20.21. <HI>As my Father hath &s;ent me, &s;o &s;end I you,</HI> &amp;c: which (he judges) <Q>doth imply a <HI>new Commi&s;&s;ion,</HI> ve&s;t|ing the Eleven Apo&s;tles with the Power of <HI>Ordination,</HI> or of &s;ending others; for (he argues) unle&s;s CHRIST gave 'em that Power, he did not &s;end them <HI>as his Father &s;ent him.</HI></Q>
Here I might ob&s;erve, There are other and better Interpretations of this Text; but being willing to take the Gentleman in his own way, I will for once &s;uppo&s;e his Con&s;truction to be the be&s;t and true&s;t: yet of what Service it will be to him, in the pre&s;ent Argument, I cannot imagin. Surely 'tis a wild Conclu&s;ion he draws, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>Then it is evident, that our Savior left his Church with a Set of Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters ve&s;ted with <HI>different</HI> degrees of Power and Authority.</Q> For this Inference is grounded on a fal&s;e Hypothe&s;is, <HI>viz.</HI> That CHRIST at his A&s;cen&s;ion left <HI>other</HI> Mi|ni&s;ters in Commi&s;&s;ion be&s;ides the <HI>Eleven;</HI> which is a point he has not &s;aid one word to prove:
<PB N="4" REF="002531_0005_0FDB5BCBA3DF9FD0">
Certainly this Gentleman mu&s;t have a fine Talent in Controver&s;y; &s;ince he has taken &s;o much pains to prove what no body denies, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Eleven were ve&s;ted with a power of Ordination; and then has taken for granted one of the main Things in Que&s;tion, <HI>viz.</HI> The Continuance of the Seventy in Office in the Church. All Anti-Pre|lati&s;ts agree with him in a&s;&s;erting the former, but not the latter. We unanimou&s;ly affirm the <HI>Tem|poreity</HI> of the Seventy. If then the Gentle|man wou'd have (as he promis'd to do) taken us in our own way, He &s;hou'd have &s;uppos'd this; and this notwith&s;tanding, prov'd an <HI>Imparity</HI> of order among Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters. Now that He might well &s;uppo&s;e (with us) the 70 to be tem|porary, every one I believe will readily grant, who reads impartially what is &s;aid on this Sub|ject in the <HI>Sober Remarks</HI> (Edit. 2. <HI>Pag.</HI> 29. &amp;c.) So that I need &s;ay nothing on it here. But he &s;ilently &s;lides over this, as if it were a point not di&s;puted, or were foreign to the Argu|ment; when he knows it is a matter of Debate, and that not a little depends upon it. For, if the Commi&s;&s;ion of the Seventy was but tempo|rary, and not renew'd after CHRIST's Re&s;urrection, then He left only one Order of Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Eleven;</HI> and tho&s;e ve&s;ted with equal Power of Ordination and Juri&s;diction, by the new Commi&s;&s;ion they receiv'd at His A&s;cending.</P>
<P>WE may &s;afely therefore grant our Author, <Q>That the <HI>Eleven Apostles</HI> receiv'd a Power by this la&s;t Commi&s;&s;ion, which they had not be|fore, and which none of the <HI>Seventy</HI> did <HI>then</HI> receive: and yet it will not follow from hence, That our Savior left his Church with a Set of
<PB N="5" REF="002531_0006_0FDB5BCF4E224558">
Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters ve&s;ted with <HI>different</HI> degrees of Power and Authority.</Q></P>
<P>HOWEVER, to take this Gentleman in his own way, I will for once &s;uppo&s;e the Commi&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Seventy</HI> (recorded <HI>Luk.</HI> 10.) was not temporary, but &s;tanding and perpetual: yet this will not certainly infer the Divine Appointment of two different Orders of Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters, in the <HI>Gentile</HI> Churches, with whom it is we are con|cerned. For (as it is argu'd in the <HI>Sober Re|marks,</HI> pag. 31, 32.) the Commi&s;&s;ion of the Se|venty was confined to the <HI>Circumci&s;ion;</HI> and we never read of its being extended by CHRIST, to the <HI>Uncircumci&s;ion.</HI> It is of no Obligation then upon the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> Suppo&s;ing it did continue, &amp; was obligatory to the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Chri&s;tians; yet the <HI>Gentile</HI> Churches are not at all concerned with it. Whether therefore that Commi&s;&s;ion was temporary, or whether it was &s;tanding, it is alike incapable of &s;erving this Gentleman's Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT now leaving the Commi&s;&s;ions, He comes to argue from FACT, Pag. 80. Where He tells us, <Q>The <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> did <HI>(de facto)</HI> exerci&s;e <HI>Juri&s;diction</HI> over all other <HI>Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters</HI> in their Time.</Q>&mdash; This I will for once &s;uppo&s;e to be true; for I'm willing &s;till to take the Gentleman in his own way: but yet I believe, It will not afford any Argument for Dioce&s;an Bi&s;hops, if we con&s;ider things impartially.</P>
<P>HE tells us, The Apo&s;tles exerci&s;ed Authori|ty over the Re&s;t of the Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters, <HI>In making Laws.</HI> What then? Do's this argue, that there mu&s;t be a &s;tanding Order in the Church to make Laws, and pre&s;cribe Rules to Mini&s;ters? No, by no means. The Church was in its <HI>Infant-State</HI> then, and the Canon of <HI>Scripture</HI> not per|fected;
<PB N="6" REF="002531_0007_0FDB5BD2589E5E40">
the Apo&s;tles were therefore extraordi+narily in&s;pir'd, to reveal the Mind and Will of CHRIST, unto his People and Mini&s;ters <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">See the <HI>Sober Remarks,</HI> pag. 33. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Edit. 2.</NOTE>. But, as there is no need of any &s;uch infallible Guides now, &s;ince the Canon of the New Te&s;tament is completed; So, that the Apo&s;tles, who were di|vinely in&s;pir'd, and under an infallible Conduct, did pre&s;cribe Rules and Laws to Churches and Pa&s;tors, This certainly is no Warrant, to Men not &s;o qualify'd, to pre&s;ume to do the &s;ame thing, 'Tis not a <HI>Legi&s;lative,</HI> but an <HI>Executive</HI> Power, that belongs to the ordinary Governors of the Church. They have Authority only to execute the Laws of CHRIST, contained in the Holy Scriptures. And I know of no Laws or Orders there, but what ordinary Pa&s;tors have the Execu|tion of, committed to them.</P>
<P>Again, HE tells us, <Q>The Apo&s;tles Authority over other Mini&s;ters appears from their <HI>Or|daining to Mini&s;terial Offices:</HI> which work (he &s;ays) was always perform'd by <HI>Them.</HI></Q></P>
<P>TO prove this, He ob&s;erves to us, in the fir&s;t place, That the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> ordain'd the <HI>Deacons,</HI> Act. 6.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer; Good Rea&s;on there was, that they &s;hould do it. The Apo&s;tles were the only proper Per&s;ons to perform that fir&s;t Ordination; for it was an appointing a <HI>New Office</HI> in the Church, which none el&s;e had Power to do, and unto which (no doubt) they were directed by the Holy Gho&s;t. If any then will infer from this In&s;tance, that Bi&s;hops only have Power to ordain Deacons; they may as colourably argue from it, That Bi&s;hops have Power to in&s;titute <HI>new</HI> Officers &amp; Mini&s;tries in the Church.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="002531_0008_0FDB5BD80A451AC8">AGAIN, The Gentleman ob&s;erves to us; <Q>That St. <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> ordain'd <HI>Elders</HI> in every City, (<HI>Church,</HI> it &s;hould be.) <HI>Act.</HI> 14.23.</Q> To which I'll reply, in the Words of Another "Good Rea&s;on why; Becau&s;e They were new Churches that had no Mini&s;ters in them till con&s;tituted by the Apo&s;tles. Presbyters cou'd not ordain before they had a Being. Be&s;ides by the way, it may be ob&s;erv'd: "They ordain'd <HI>Presbyters;</HI> not Dioce&s;an Bi&s;hops. 'Tis evident from this In|&s;tance, that the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> left the Churches under the Government of <HI>Presbyters,</HI> without <HI>Supe|rior Bi&s;hops.</HI> How came the Apo&s;tles not to or|dain &s;uch Bi&s;hops in every Church! If they had been nece&s;&s;ary, doubtle&s;s they wou'd have done it".</P>
<P>BUT further, The Gentleman ob&s;erves, <Q>There is one In&s;tance, from which this Apo&s;tolical Superiority appears plainly; for when <HI>Philip</HI> baptis'd the Converts in <HI>Samaria Act.</HI> 8.12. Yet they could receive no <HI>Impo&s;ition of Hands</HI> from him: but the Apo&s;tles at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> &s;ent St. <HI>Peter,</HI> and St. <HI>John</HI> to <HI>lay hands on them;</HI> that is, for Confirmation and <HI>Ordination.</HI></Q> To which I an&s;wer; His Argument is lo&s;t, if he has mi&s;taken the <HI>De&s;ign</HI> of that Impo&s;ition of Hands. And it &s;eems he has done &s;o. For it is highly probable, 'Twas only for <HI>conferring the extraordi|nary Gifts of the Holy Ghost;</HI> which was a Power and Honour peculiar to the <HI>Apo&s;tles.</HI> (See <HI>Act.</HI> 8.15, 18.) That this was the <HI>Primary</HI> End, at lea&s;t, we have the general Concurrence of the be&s;t Expo&s;itors. And if this was the End, it is what was not only out of <HI>Philip</HI>'s power, but out of Bi&s;hop <HI>Timothy</HI>'s too; and had <HI>He</HI> been at <HI>Sa|maria</HI> then, there would have been the &s;ame Oc|ca&s;ion
<PB N="8" REF="002531_0009_0FDB5BD916A58FC8">
to &s;end down the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> thither.&mdash;How|ever, to take the Gentleman in his own way, I will for once &s;uppo&s;e, that this Impo&s;ition of Hands immediately and only refer'd to <HI>Confirma|tion</HI> and <HI>Ordination:</HI> yet I do not &s;ee how <HI>Philip</HI>'s not being capable of performing the&s;e works, can afford any Argument to his purpo&s;e: for, accord|ing to him, <HI>Philip</HI> at that time was but a <HI>Deacon;</HI> and a Deacon's being incapable, is no Argument that a <HI>Presbyter</HI> (an higher Officer) mu&s;t be &s;o too. To make his Rea&s;oning here any thing tolerable. He mu&s;t allow <HI>Philip</HI> was a Presbyter: but then the mi&s;chief is, This will be to contra|dict him&s;elf; &s;ince he expre&s;ly calls him a Dea|con, (<HI>pag.</HI> 93.) and it will unhappily overthrow his great Plea there, [from the In&s;tance of <HI>Philip</HI>] for <HI>Preaching</HI> &amp; <HI>Bapti&s;ing</HI> Deacons.</P>
<P>IN the next place, The Gentleman ob&s;erves. <Q>It is <HI>Objected,</HI> That mere Presbyters ordain'd St. <HI>Timothy&punc;</HI> from 1 Tim. 4.14. <HI>The laying on of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> the Presbytery.</HI> But (&s;ays he) this Text does not at all prove that <HI>Presbyters</HI> (in <HI>our</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of the Word) ordain'd <HI>Timothy.</HI></Q>
I reply, We don't pretend it do's. For we know of no Mini&s;ters in <HI>Scripture,</HI> that were Presbyters, in the modern (<HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI>) &s;en&s;e of the Word. We deny any &s;uch Officer in the Church, us a <HI>mere Presbyter,</HI> that is, a Mini&s;ter of the Word, de&s;titute of Epi&s;copal Power over the Flock. The Elders, or Presbyters, we read of, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5.1. were <HI>Bi&s;hops.</HI> Such Bi&s;hops we are For, and &s;uch Elders; but we know of no In&s;titu|tion for Elders that do not rule over the Flock, or for Bi&s;hops that rule over Elders. We are for Congregational Bi&s;hops; and &s;uch we conclude,
<PB N="9" REF="002531_0010_0FDB5BDAA9FE2328">
were the Presbyters that ordain'd <HI>Timothy.</HI>&mdash;But the Gentleman adds, <Q>If mere Presbyters did lay hands on him, it was only in <HI>Conjunction</HI> with St. <HI>Paul:</HI> for he &s;ays expre&s;ly, (2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.6.) that <HI>Timothy</HI> was ordain'd <HI>by the laying on of</HI> His <HI>Hands.</HI></Q></P>
<P>NOW to this I reply.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE Impo&s;ition of <HI>Paul</HI>'s Hands might be at a <HI>different Time,</HI> and upon &s;ome other Occa|&s;ion.</P>
<P>IT is mo&s;t probable, <HI>Paul</HI>'s laying on of Hands was not for the ordination of <HI>Timothy</HI> to any Office, but only for conferring the extraordinary Gifts of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> upon him. This might be the whole De&s;ign, for ought that appears to the Contrary; and &s;o <HI>Paul</HI> might have no hand at all in <HI>Timothy</HI>'s Ordination. But that might be done by ordinary <HI>Presbyters</HI> at &s;ome other Time; as <HI>Paul</HI> him&s;elf, who receiv'd his &s;ight by the laying on of the Hands of <HI>Ananias,</HI> &amp; was filled with the Holy Gho&s;t, yet afterwards was &s;eparated to his Mini&s;try among the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> by the laying on of the Hands of <HI>certain Prophets and Teachers,</HI> or Presbyters, at <HI>Antioch.</HI> (Act. 13.1, 2, 3.)</P>
<P>BUT I would again take the Gentleman in his own way, and therefore will for once &s;uppo&s;e, That <HI>Paul</HI>'s laying on of Hands was for <HI>Timothy</HI>'s <HI>Ordination;</HI> yet it is po&s;&s;ible it might not be in <HI>Conjunction</HI> with the <HI>Presbytery,</HI> but at a di&s;|tinct Time, if what our Opponents plead for, was then practis'd, <HI>viz. Reordination.</HI> How knows this Gentleman but that <HI>Timothy</HI> might be ordain'd fir&s;t a <HI>Presbyter</HI> by the <HI>Presbytery</HI> alone, and after|wards a <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> by <HI>Paul</HI> only. Some of his Bre|thren I know &s;eem to be of this Mind. Well
<PB N="10" REF="002531_0011_0FDB5BDE234E9AD0">
for once &s;uppo&s;e this was the Ca&s;e; &s;o much then at lea&s;t follows, that <HI>Presbyters</HI> have power to ordain Presbyters: and this is all we at pre|&s;ent demand. As for <HI>Dioce&s;an</HI> Bi&s;hops, &amp; their <HI>Con&s;ecration,</HI> we will contentedly leave our Opponents to enjoy their Opinion about 'em; if we may but enjoy ours without Di&s;turbance.</P>
<P>BUT now to come clo&s;er to our Author,&mdash;</P>
<P N="2">2. I will for once &s;uppo&s;e, that <HI>Paul</HI>'s laying on of hands, and the <HI>Presbytery</HI>'s, were both at the <HI>&s;ame Time,</HI> and in <HI>Conjunction;</HI> yet I can't &s;ee how this Conce&s;&s;ion will give him any Ad|vantage. The Gentleman ob&s;erves, <Q>If <HI>Presby|ters</HI> did lay on hands in <HI>Timothy</HI>'s Ordination, it was <HI>only</HI> in Conjunction with St. <HI>Paul, [yes
verily, and if St.</HI> Paul <HI>lay'd on hands, it was only in Conjunction with the</HI> Presbytery] And &s;o is agreable to our Practice at this day, as may be &s;een in the Rubrick of the Office for ordaining Prie&s;ts.</Q>&mdash;But here I inquire; <HI>How</HI> is it agreable? Do <HI>Presbyters</HI> of the Church of <HI>England</HI> joyn in laying on of Hands in the Con&s;ecrating of a <HI>Bi&s;hop,</HI> &s;uch as <HI>Timothy</HI> is &s;uppos'd by Epi&s;|copalians to be? No, I trow not. 'Tis only the <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hop,</HI> and <HI>Bi&s;hops pre&s;ent,</HI> that joyn in this Act; as may be &s;een in the Rubrick of the Of|fice for the Con&s;ecration of Bi&s;hops. Either then it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, <HI>Timothy</HI> was not a <HI>Bi&s;hop;</HI> and &s;o one of the great Arguments for <HI>Prelacy</HI> will be drop't. Or at lea&s;t it mu&s;t be &s;uppos'd <HI>Timothy</HI> was not ordain'd Bi&s;hop <HI>at that time,</HI> when <HI>Paul</HI> &amp; the <HI>Presbytery</HI> joyn'd together in impo&s;ing hands on him: however he might be afterwards, by <HI>Paul</HI> alone; which I think will &s;uper&s;ede the common Pretences for <HI>Timothy</HI>'s Epi&s;copacy, from the <HI>first</HI> Epi&s;tle to Him. Or el&s;e the Church of <HI>England</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="002531_0012_0FDB5BDF1DA704C8">
mu&s;t confe&s;s, She <HI>Deviates</HI> from the primitive <HI>Pattern,</HI> in excluding <HI>Presbyters</HI> from joyning in the Ordination of her Bi&s;hops: and &s;o far She mu&s;t appear not Primitive and Apo&s;tolical; and her <HI>Prelates</HI> mu&s;t be own'd not <HI>regularly</HI> con&s;e|crated; becau&s;e their Ordinations are without the Concurrence of the <HI>Presbytery.</HI> &mdash; One of the&s;e three, I think, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be granted: and let the Gentleman chu&s;e which he likes be&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT now, &s;uppo&s;ing there were no &s;uch Diffi|culties ari&s;ing on the Head of <HI>Timothy</HI>'s Character, and allowing that <HI>Paul</HI>'s a&s;&s;ociating with him the Presbytery in <HI>Timothy</HI>'s Ordination, was but like the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI>'s taking the Hands of &s;ome <HI>Presbyters</HI> with his, (as is the practice of the Church of <HI>England</HI>) in the ordination of a <HI>Presbyter;</HI> what Advantage will our Opponents be able to make of &s;uch a Conce&s;&s;ion? I think, none at all. For it &s;eems to me, nothing more can be hence collected, but that as the <HI>Apostles</HI> did not appropriate to them&s;elves the Power of Ordination, &s;o neither doth the Church of <HI>England</HI> allow her <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> to arrogate to them&s;elves the &s;ole Power in this matter. The Practice of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as well as of the Apo&s;tles, &s;eems to argue for an inherent Power of ordination in <HI>Presbyters;</HI> which is all we at pre&s;ent plead for. Impo&s;ition of Hands is what our Opponents account a very e&s;|&s;ential Rite in Ordination. That they judge is put for the whole Mini&s;terial Work of Ordina|tion, in 1 Tim. 5.22. <HI>Lay Hands &s;uddenly on no man:</HI> and hence they urge this place, in favour of <HI>Timothy</HI>'s ordaining Power. Now if Impo&s;iti|on of Hands, when perform'd by <HI>Timothy,</HI> was an ordaining Act, and imported an ordaining Power inherent in him; why might it not have the

&s;ame Signification, when perform'd by the <HI>Pres|bytery?</HI> And if Ordination was the End and Im|port of <HI>Paul</HI>'s laying on of Hands; why not al&s;o of the laying on of the Hands of the <HI>Presbyters,</HI> that joyn'd with him?

<P>WELL but for once we will &s;uppo&s;e, that the <HI>Presbytery</HI> did not lay on hands <HI>as Ordainers,</HI> but the whole Efficacy of the Ordination was from
<PB N="13" REF="002531_0014_0FDB5BE5F678DEB8">
the Impo&s;ition of <HI>Paul</HI>s Hands; yet how will this tend to &s;erve our Author's Cau&s;e? Will this infer, that <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> may a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves the whole Power, exclu&s;ively of the Presbyters joyn|ing with them? No, not at all. I will make it out thus. <HI>Paul</HI> laid on hands, either in his ordi|nary, or extraordinary Capacity. Now if the whole Efficacy of the Ordination was from HIS Impo&s;ing of Hands, It cou'd not be in his <HI>ordinary</HI> Capacity, that he ordain'd; becau&s;e an Apo&s;tle in his ordinary Character was but a <HI>Presbyter,</HI> (as I think is fully prov'd in the <HI>Sober Remarks,</HI> to which I mu&s;t refer the Reader for &s;atisfaction) and upon this view of them, there can be no &s;olid Rea&s;ons a&s;&s;ign'd for &s;o e&s;&s;ential a <HI>Difference</HI> (in the Virtue and Meaning) between the Act of <HI>Paul,</HI> and the Act of the <HI>Presbytery,</HI> in <HI>Timothy</HI>'s Ordination. Hence therefore it mu&s;t be in his <HI>extraordinary</HI> Capacity, that <HI>Paul</HI> ordain'd; and if &s;o, then I ask, what Warrant <HI>Paul</HI>'s having the &s;ole ordaining Power, exclu&s;ively of the Presby|tery, will be to <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> for confining the Power of Ordination wholly to them&s;elves? Are they Suc|ce&s;&s;ors to the Apo&s;tles, in the <HI>extraordinary</HI> parts of their Character? Have our Bi&s;hops the Gift of <HI>Infallibility?</HI> Have they the Power of <HI>di&s;|cerning Spirits?</HI> Or can they confer the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> by the laying on of their Hands? Verily, &s;how us Bi&s;hops &s;o qualify'd, and we &s;hall be tempted to leave the work of Ordination <HI>wholly</HI> to Them, wherever they come! But till we can &s;ee &s;uch Bi&s;hops (at lea&s;t till then) we mu&s;t be allow'd to a&s;&s;ert the <HI>Presbyters</HI> Claim to the Power of Ordination. <Q>And indeed the moderate A&s;|&s;ertors of Epi&s;copacy (as one ob&s;erves) do ac|knowlege that the Presbyters lay on hands

<P>NOW therefore, if Presbyters lay on hands with the Bi&s;hop, as <HI>Ordainers,</HI> either They have an equal Power, or not. If they have an <HI>equal</HI> Power, then in the Ordination of a Mini&s;ter, there is as much to be attributed to the Presbyters lay|ing on of Hands, as to the Bi&s;hops: and hence it will follow, that Ordinations perform'd by Pres|byters, without a Dioce&s;an Bi&s;hop, are no more null and void, than ordinations perform'd by &s;uch a Bi&s;hop, without the concurrence of the Presbytery.&mdash; But if any &s;hall &s;ay, <HI>Presbyters</HI> have <HI>not</HI> an equal ordaining Power, with the Bi&s;hop; I then ask, How this appears? If their Power be unequal, it mu&s;t ari&s;e, either from unequal <HI>Commi&s;&s;ions,</HI> or from unequal <HI>Qualifications.</HI> It cannot be owing to any difference of intrin&s;ick <HI>Qualifications</HI> and Gifts. For if we con&s;ider the <HI>Nature</HI> of Ordination, we &s;hall find that the ordi|nary Gifts of <HI>Presbyters</HI> are proportionable to all the outward Acts of it. What is Ordination, but a &s;olemn <HI>Dedication</HI> or <HI>Separation</HI> of a &s;utable Per|&s;on to God for the Mini&s;try, by Fa&s;ting &amp; Prayer, with laying on of Hands? Now what is there in all this, above the Capacity of a <HI>mere</HI> Presbyter? What does the Bi&s;hop do more in his <HI>conferring the Mini&s;try?</HI> Is it in any Moral Act, or in the Phy&s;ical Contact only, that the Bi&s;hop exerts more of an ordaining Power!

Which of 'em, I pray!&mdash;But I believe our Opponents will not &s;o much ground the Di&s;tinction here. If then there be an Inequality of ordaining Power, in Bi&s;hops and in Presbyters, it mu&s;t ari&s;e from the Difference of their <HI>Commi&s;&s;ions.</HI> But this cannot be; becau&s;e the Commi&s;&s;ion for ordination is one, and no more. An ordaining Power is included in the Apo&s;tles Commi&s;&s;ion, Mat. 28.19. <HI>Go teach all Nations, bapti&s;ing them,</HI> &amp;c. Or, (if it will plea&s;e our Author better in his own Text) Joh. 20.21. <HI>As my Father hath &s;ent me, even &s;o &s;end I you.</HI> And they that pretend to the power of or|dination, mu&s;t claim it by this Commi&s;&s;ion, as Succe&s;&s;ors to the Apo&s;tles in the &s;tanding parts of the Go&s;pel-Mini&s;try. Hence then, if Presbyters have any degree of ordaining Power, it is equal &amp; the &s;ame with the Bi&s;hops, without any the lea&s;t Di&s;parity or Di&s;tinction. I think there cannot be a clearer Con&s;equence. If therefore my Lords the Bi&s;hops will claim a &s;uperior Power to Pre&s;|byters; They mu&s;t either produce &s;ome <HI>new</HI> Commi&s;&s;ion for it: or prove that Presbyters do not derive what ordaining Power they have, from the Commi&s;&s;ion <HI>above-mentioned:</HI> or el&s;e that the mini&s;terial Powers given the Apo&s;tles in this Commi&s;&s;ion, might be tran&s;mitted to their Suc|ce&s;&s;ors in <HI>unequal</HI> Degrees. One of the&s;e things they mu&s;t do before we can become their Profe|lytes, and let them undertake which they plea&s;e, I'm afraid they'll fail in the Attempt and Confu&s;ion will cover 'em,&mdash; Thus I have ful|ly con&s;ider'd the Gentleman's <HI>fir&s;t</HI> An&s;wer to

<P N="1">1. I deny this to be very plain and obvious: and rather think the contrary is &s;o.

<P>IN fine, The &s;uppo&s;ed Pre&s;idency of the Apo&s;tles in the Ordinations in their time, can be no more an Objection again&s;t Ordination by <HI>Presbyters</HI> alone, than by <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> alone. For either there were no &s;uch Men as Dioce&s;an Bi&s;hops then;

or admitting there were, the Apo&s;tles had a Su|periority over them, and Bi&s;hops cou'd no more ordain without an Apo&s;tle, than Presbyters cou'd. Let our Adver&s;aries produce either Scripture Pre|cept, or Scripture Precedent, for Dioce&s;an <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> ordaining <HI>without a Superior:</HI> or tell us how the Pre&s;idency of the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> can make for the Pre|&s;idency of <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> in the ordinations of Mini&s;ters: or &s;how us any Divine <HI>Prohibition</HI> of <HI>Presbyters</HI> ordaining <HI>without</HI> a Superior.

Now, if ordinary Pa&s;tors &amp; Presbyters are authoriz'd at all by virtue of that Commi&s;&s;ion, it mu&s;t be by <HI>immediate Inve&s;titure.</HI> The <HI>Deacons</HI> indeed have a more remove and mediate or con|&s;equential Reference to that Commi&s;&s;ion: becau&s;e either their Office was originally <HI>imply'd</HI> in it, but the Apo&s;tles (by the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI>) in&s;tituted a new &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Order of Men</HI> to &s;u&s;tain <HI>that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> of the Commi&s;&s;ion; or el&s;e a <HI>new Office,</HI> di&s;tinct from that of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> was in|&s;tituted, by <HI>virtue</HI> of that Commi&s;&s;ion.&mdash;But now as to the <HI>Presbyters,</HI> their Ca&s;e is va&s;tly different. For the Presbyters Authority is more <HI>immediately</HI> founded in that Commi&s;&s;ion, &amp; is not a <HI>&s;econdary</HI> Thing. The Mini&s;terial Commi&s;&s;ion is but one. I know of no Commi&s;&s;ion to <HI>preach the Word,</HI> and <HI>admini&s;ter Go&s;pel-Sacraments,</HI> but
<PB N="33" REF="002531_0034_0FDB5C18958BEA38">
that which was given to the Apo&s;tles, in <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. And no man may pretend to do tho&s;e Things, but by virtue of that Commi&s;&s;ion, devolv'd upon him. To allude to &s;ome of our Author's own Words be|fore quoted; <Q>If it is not by virtue of [a direct &amp; proper Inve&s;titure in] this Commi&s;&s;ion given to the Apo&s;tles by our Saviour, that ALL <HI>Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters</HI> are authoriz'd, I de&s;ire any one to &s;hew me <HI>what</HI> Authority they have, and <HI>where</HI> it is given.</Q> In &s;hort, let our Opponents pro|duce any Commi&s;&s;ion that the <HI>Apostles</HI> have given, by virtue of that Commi&s;&s;ion granted to them, in&s;tituting an Order of <HI>Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters</HI> or Presby|ters, not having <HI>Epi&s;copal</HI> Powers; and we will yield the Cau&s;e. Or let 'em prove that the <HI>Suc|ce&s;&s;ors</HI> of the Apo&s;tles had <HI>Authority</HI> to con&s;titute a new order of mere Presbyters or Subject Pa&s;|tors; and it will do as well. But till they can perform one or other of the&s;e Things, they mu&s;t indulge our Weakne&s;s, if we &s;till adhere to the Opinion, That all Go&s;pel-Mini&s;ters are in a <HI>di|rect</HI> and <HI>immediate</HI> Way authoriz'd by the Apo&s;|tles Commi&s;&s;ion, or (in other words) actually <HI>inve&s;ted</HI> with it.</P>
<P>AND now, if it be thus, it mu&s;t need follow, that <HI>Presbyters</HI> &amp; <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> are of one &amp; the &s;ame Order and Degree; ina&s;much as their Claim to the Powers contain'd in that Commi&s;&s;ion, is <HI>equal</HI> &amp; the &s;ame.

There is no force then in the pretended Example of Scripture-Deacons, to prove that Deacons as &s;uch, &amp; in ordinary Ca&s;es may preach &amp; baptize.

before quoted [<HI>pag.</HI> 22,] &s;peaking of the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> ob|&s;erves; &mdash; <Q>They condemn without Mercy all who differ from them: They damn them fir&s;t, and then per&s;ecute them without Bowels. They think their Communion is the one Church, out of which there is no Salvation.</Q>
He adds; <Q><HI>I wi&s;h none of <HI>their Leaven</HI> may be <HI>fermenting among Vs:</HI></HI> In this La&s;t Particular, a Notion begins to be &s;pread among us, that goes <HI>further</HI> even than <HI>their</HI> Un|charitablene&s;s. <HI>They</HI> only deny that tho&s;e who are not of their Body are <HI>Catholicks:</HI> but there is a Conceit lately got in among us, that denies all who are not baptized among <HI>Us</HI> [that is, in the Church of England] to be <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> &s;huts them out of CHRIST's Covenant, and thinks them no better than Heathens. A Notion that tho' it once got into &s;ome Churches, who thought that the Bapti&s;m of Hereticks was of no Value, and ought to be repeated upon their Coming into the Church, yet was &s;olemnly condemned and rejected by all the Churches of God now for above Fourteen Hundred Years. In Popery the Midwives gene|rally baptize: yet, though this is again&s;t an expre&s;s Rule of the Apo&s;tles, That a <HI>Woman ought not to &s;peak in the Church,</HI> none of the Reformed ever thought of rebaptizing the Per|&s;ons &s;o baptized: Nor did our Church at the <HI>Re&s;toration</HI> ever entertain the lea&s;t Motion of this &s;ort. But now this is receiv'd by many, among the other wild Conceits of the Corrupter of our Faith &amp; Church, who broached <HI>this,</HI> with many other <HI>mon&s;trous</HI> Errors, which he has carried &s;o near Athei&s;m, as to deny the Immortality of the Soul, and to put the Immortalizing Virtue in a Bapti&s;m given by Per|&s;ons Epi&s;copally ordained.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE common Topick <HI>(adds the Bi&s;hop)</HI> for &s;upporting this <HI>wild unheard of <HI>Paradox,</HI></HI> is, that the Commi&s;&s;ion to preach and baptize was given to the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> &s;o that none but their <HI>Succe&s;&s;ors</HI> can pretend to it. But has not every Chri&s;tian, in ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity, a Right <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>

<P><Q>THIS is not the only &s;tep &s;ome are making towards <HI>Popery;</HI> but with &s;o little Knowledge and Con&s;ideration, that it is to be hoped they do it ignorantly&punc; mi&s;led by a great Name &amp; a &s;hew of Learning; which many &s;eem more willing to admire in others, than diligent to arrive at it them&s;elves.</Q></P>
