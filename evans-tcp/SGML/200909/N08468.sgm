<P>THE pious and benevolent Founder of the&s;e lectures, having limited the preach|ers of this &s;econd in the &s;eries, to the &s;ub|ject of Chri&s;tianity in the mo&s;t preci&s;e idea of it; we are called to review it, and di&s;cour&s;e upon it, as the plan of &s;upreme wi&s;dom for the re&s;toring a degenerate race to virtue and to glo|ry;&mdash;by enlightning human darkne&s;s;&mdash;by reclaiming the di&s;obedient to the wi&s;dom of the ju&s;t;&mdash;by rendring the happine&s;s of offenders con&s;i&s;tent with the perfect purity of the &s;upreme Governor;&mdash;by aboli&s;hing death, and re&s;toring tho&s;e &s;ubjected to it to immortality; that plan "which eye had not before &s;een, nor ear heard, nor had it entred into the heart of man to conceive of;" a plan executed at &s;uch a time, in &s;uch a manner, and by &s;uch in&s;truments, as to Him, the all-perfect &s;ource of it, &s;eemed be&s;t, and which is therefore on all accounts be&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="010827_0004_0F81D3792E2B3E90">
IN order to men's becoming partakers of the bene|fits of this plan of grace, they mu&s;t them&s;elves be active. Not indeed in completely informing them&s;elves, as from their own proper fund, of every article which conduces to their virtue or their hopes; (many of the&s;e mu&s;t be derived immediately from him by who&s;e good plea|&s;ure alone they exi&s;t, and offered from him to the human mind;) but in examining the evidence, by which what|ever claims to be divine truth, &s;upports its claim&mdash;in receiving it in the love of it&mdash;and in being &s;anctified by it.</P>
<P>THEREFORE tho&s;e who would attain the ble&s;&s;ings of the go&s;pel, and experience it to be "the power of God unto &s;alvation," mu&s;t be per&s;uaded of the truth of <HI>Chri&s;tianity properly &s;o called;</HI> and the que&s;tion ari&s;es, How &s;hall men arrive to this per&s;ua&s;ion, which is in our text termed <HI>faith?</HI> Now St. Paul affirms that this faith or per&s;ua&s;ion hath not it's foundation on, or it's exi&s;tence in or by the "wi&s;dom of men, but the power of God."</P>
<P>I SHALL at pre&s;ent take it for granted, that the phra&s;e, "the wi&s;dom of men," means the di&s;qui&s;itions of philo&s;ophers, (e&s;pecially as retailed in the harangues of orators and rhetoricians;) the terms, "wi&s;e men of this world," "the &s;cribe," "the di&s;puter," "the natural man," point out tho&s;e who refu&s;e to receive any thing as divine truth, but what they become ac|quainted with in the &s;ame proce&s;s, thro' which they are informed of the principles of any other &s;cience.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="010827_0005_0F81D379EE376008">
I FURTHER a&s;&s;ume here, and refer my hearers to the cour&s;e of the former part of this epi&s;tle for the ju&s;tice of the con&s;truction; that the apo&s;tle intends by "faith" the a&s;&s;ent of the mind to tho&s;e propo&s;itions which are offered to our a&s;&s;ent from the fountain of truth, though their ab&s;tract nature, rea&s;on and found|ation, did not before, or do not now, fully appear to the mind. (In other parts of the go&s;pel, however, 'tis plain that the word "faith" includes in it's idea an inward, cordial reception of, and reliance upon, Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in all his offices; and in other places, in a yet larger &s;en&s;e, the whole Chri&s;tian temper and life is de&s;cribed under this comprehen&s;ive word "faith.")</P>
<P>AND la&s;tly, I think it plain, that by the expre&s;&s;ions, "the power of God," "demon&s;tration of the Spirit," and "&s;piritual di&s;cernment," he de&s;igns that evidence of miracles and it's influence, which the preachers of Chri&s;t adduced, as full proof of their being immediately employed of God to promulge tho&s;e truths, and upon which evidence tho&s;e they were &s;ent to were bound to embrace them, and act upon them.</P>
<P>FROM this review of our context it may appear, that we are led to lay down &s;ome truths as premi&s;es, from which the ju&s;tice of our text as a conclu&s;ion will follow. I lay it down then as clear, that the per&s;on who will a&s;&s;ent to nothing but what he is intuitively certain of, or convinced of by ab&s;tract rea&s;oning, mu&s;t remain igno|rant of many and very intere&s;ting truths. That there|fore in this &s;tate of imperfection and &s;in, men need to have much religious knowledge conveyed to them in
<PB N="8" REF="010827_0006_0F81D37AAD0B4FA0">&s;ome other way. Chri&s;tianity fully relieves us under this unhappine&s;s, this nece&s;&s;ity. It relieves us by "faith" in it as a divine revelation. And we are induced to this "faith" by the te&s;timony of God; the exertion of his power to warrant the divine mi&s;&s;ion of its founders. Therefore it is "&s;piritually di&s;cerned." "Our faith &s;tandeth not in the wi&s;dom of men, but the power of God."</P>
<P N="1">I. THE fir&s;t part of my bu&s;ine&s;s, then, will be to illu&s;trate and confirm this point; That notwith&s;tanding the various avenues to religious knowledge, yet there are important articles of &s;peculation and motives to practice, which men in the be&s;t improvement of the powers of their minds cannot attain to; (to which I &s;hall add) and many more, which, in a &s;tate of nature, men had but little or no knowledge of.</P>
<P>WE are beings, <HI>my hearers,</HI> of limited capacities; there are bounds we cannot pa&s;s. Within tho&s;e bounds there are three dictinct avenues by which truth enters the mind, and is acknowledged by it. They are, in|tuition, di&s;cu&s;&s;ion or rea&s;oning, and te&s;timony.</P>
<P>INTUITION is the direct view the &s;oul has of the truth and reality of any one, or the relation of any two or more ideas, that they are &s;o immediate as neither to need nor admit of any rea&s;oning to di&s;cover it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THE propo&s;ition, "I am," is intuitively certain; and to argue, "I think therefore I am," is trifling logick. And where one conceives ju&s;tly of God and man, it lies equally clear in the mind, that men are the &s;ubjects of the moral government of God. Perhaps al&s;o the idea of cau&s;e and effect, is among all created things, as clear and unperplexed: The mind &s;ees without a cour&s;e of ar|gument that nothing which begins to exi&s;t, can be without &s;ome agency to pro|duce it. There mu&s;t therefore be &s;ome fixt and nece&s;&s;arily exi&s;ting cau&s;e of it. So with regard to morality, right and wrong appear in many in&s;tances mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">|ous; and he who labours by a cour&s;e of ethical arguments to prove the obliquity of ingratitude, profanene&s;s, murder, and the like, might be more u&s;efully em|ployed.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="010827_0007_0F81D37B6D2386D8">
WHEN &s;elf-evident principles fail us, we apply to rea&s;oning, and come by an indefinite number of &s;teps, in proportion as truth lies near or more remote from intuition, to low probability or moral certainty.</P>
<P>BUT then, with re&s;pect to both the&s;e &s;ources of know|ledge, reflection on our&s;elves, and the experience of mankind in general, compel us to own their deficincy in re&s;pects mo&s;t deeply concerning our be&s;t welfare.</P>
<P>AND though 'tis not intended, by any <HI>Eulogium</HI> on Chri&s;tianity, to deny that the human under&s;tandng, well improved, may attain to many prime truths re&s;pecting God and morality, yet it is to be ob&s;erved that this will be the portion of but comparatively few. The extent of knowledge to which any one can arrive, depends on the original &s;tandard of his intellectual powers, and on their being cultivated by education, expanded by enquiry and the in&s;tructions of the wi&s;e, and emancipated from the &s;hackles of corporeal affection, which war again&s;t truth as well as virtue. So that &s;ome will need foreign aid beyond the operations of their own minds, much more than others, in order to their acquaintance with the &s;ame truths; and after all, there may be many, we are &s;ure there are many, and tho&s;e of great concern, which man at his be&s;t e&s;tate falls &s;hort of.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="010827_0008_0F81D37C35AF8BA8">
WHEREFORE, though we allow, that if all men were philo&s;ophers, if all had capacity, lei&s;ure and di&s;po|&s;ition for ethical and metaphy&s;ical &s;peculations; if the many were not diverted from clo&s;e thought, by the di&s;|&s;ipations and cares of life; nor prejudiced again&s;t truth and virtue by vicious affections; a much better &s;y&s;tem of theology, theoretical and practical, would have been ge|neraly received than has been; yet it is fact, experience has proved it, that not only the untutored populace have, in the &s;tate of nature, been gro&s;sly ignorant of the great things which intimately concern virtue and happine&s;s; not only were philo&s;ophers unable to make any great progre&s;s, in propagating the religion of nature; but the&s;e wi&s;e men of this world were far from agreeing among them&s;elves, in their &s;entiments of the capital doctrines and rules of religion.</P>
<P>ANCIENT hi&s;tory, as well as modern voyagers and travellers, give us credible evidence of the wretched &s;tate of unenlightened, uncultivated nature, notwith&s;tanding all the efforts of the wi&s;dom of this world. St. Paul's account was not exaggerated, when he &s;aid, "The Gen|tiles walk in the vanity of their minds, having the un|der&s;tanding darkned, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, becau&s;e of the blindne&s;s of their hearts; who, being pa&s;t feeling, have given them&s;elves over to la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s, to work all uncleanne&s;s with greedine&s;s.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ephe&s;. iv. 17.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE great God, the Lord of all, is a pure Spirit; and in proportion as the multitude are immer&s;ed in
<PB N="11" REF="010827_0009_0F81D37CE92F7500">&s;en&s;e, their conceptions of him will be gro&s;s and unwor|thy, and in &s;uch proportion the motives to &s;anctity will be weakned. Philo&s;ophers have been few in any age, who have attained to ideas, in any mea&s;ure ju&s;t, of that great Being on whom all depend; and the arguments of tho&s;e few have been &s;o &s;ubtle, that it is no wonder they had little &s;ucce&s;s in promoting true thei&s;m, to any very exten&s;ive and happy effect.</P>
<P>AS re&s;pect to God, is the formal idea of religion; &s;o the fear and love of him, are the main motives to it. For a man may have a quick and lively &s;en&s;e of moral good and evil; may clearly &s;ee beauty and proportion in the one, and ugly deformity in the other; may own an eternal fitne&s;s in the one, and that it's oppo&s;ite is con|trary to the invariable relations of things, and yet may be a very profligate, and &s;ay, "What care I for fitne&s;s, beauty, rea&s;on and right: I gratify my&s;elf, and have my reward for de&s;pi&s;ing the&s;e fine &s;pun &s;peculations? What little hold then mu&s;t &s;uch refinements have on tho&s;e, who think God &s;uch an one, or wor&s;e, than them&s;elves?</P>
<P>THE natural proofs of the immortality of the &s;oul, are extremely ab&s;tracted. The be&s;t genius's, even at this day, mu&s;t labour if they would feel their weight &mdash; The re&s;urrection from the dead, nature never &s;u&s;pected. How then &s;hould the multitude be induced to live as heirs of immortality?</P>
<P>THE chief rational ba&s;is of the doctrine of future re|wards and puni&s;hments, is the pre&s;ent unequal di&s;tribu|tions of Providence. But there are &s;o many circum|&s;tances
<PB N="12" REF="010827_0010_0F81D38059E4E800">to be attended to, before that inequality is proved, that this kind of evidence is not ea&s;ily or generally &s;een in a clear and &s;trong light. For how many never &s;aw in&s;tances of this inequality? Who preci&s;ely knows the moral characters of tho&s;e about him? Who is judge of the degree of happine&s;s attending con&s;cious virtue under &s;ufferings, or of the &s;ecret wretchedne&s;s of a profligate? Upon a penetrating mind, this argument has great force; but 'tis certain, that in times pa&s;t it has not had a general, deep influence in theory or practice.</P>
<P>WHAT man, concerned for his be&s;t intere&s;t, would not de&s;ire to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted, in emerging from the depths wherein the &s;ages of antiquity were plunged, concerning the chief good&mdash;the &s;eat and nature of virtue and vice&mdash;fixt fate and free will&mdash;&s;ullen &s;toici&s;m on the one &s;ide, and profane epicurei&s;m on the other? Who would not de&s;ire a plain direction, "what he &s;hould do to be &s;aved."</P>
<P>ESPECIALLY the great que&s;tion, what the admi|ni&s;trations of God are or &s;hall be, re&s;pecting offending creatures, who have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the divine law, and can have no hope of happine&s;s, but on the ba&s;is of mere mercy? This capital enquiry, I &s;ay, is far beyond hu|man inve&s;tigation. Whether there is with God for|givene&s;s of the penal effects of &s;in, natural or judicial&mdash;and on what terms&mdash;of how many &s;ins, and with what aggravations&mdash;and what degrees of happine&s;s are to be expected&mdash;and when and where: Rea&s;on at it's be&s;t e&s;tate is &s;ilenced here. Becau&s;e the&s;e things depend on the will of him, who&s;e "ways are not as our's;" who&s;e government re&s;pects not merely this little &s;pot, but an interminable univer&s;e; for who&s;e peace and order, &s;everity to offenders
<PB N="13" REF="010827_0011_0F81D38111D3A8E0">might, for ought men could &s;ay, be of the highe&s;t utility. Nature might hope, but unaided nature mu&s;t fear, and be &s;ubjected to an anxious bondage.</P>
<P>WHEREFORE, I &s;ay, that upon the&s;e con&s;iderations,</P>
<P N="2">II. "FAITH" is a &s;uitable, needful and comfortable method of receiving knowledge, re&s;pecting mo&s;t impor|tant points of doctrine, rules of life, and motives to right conduct.</P>
<P>SOME minds may be under &s;uch di&s;advantages, &s;o unable to determine for them&s;elves in weighty matters, that it may be their prudence to act upon the &s;entiments of others wi&s;er than them&s;elves. In matters of fact which our own &s;en&s;es have not been privy to, the te&s;ti|mony of men de&s;erves &s;uch credit, as we ought to hazard our be&s;t intere&s;ts upon.</P>
<P>BUT "if we receive the witne&s;s of men, the witne&s;s of God is greater." "When we are convinced that the fountain of truth has declared, "this propo&s;ition is true," "this conduct is right"&mdash;"this is my method of admi|ni&s;tration"&mdash;"this it is my decree to do"&mdash;"that event you are to expect;" I &s;ay, &s;o convinced, nothing remains for us, but to believe and do. And this is what I mean by "faith." A per&s;ua&s;ion on that evidence, to which we ought in rea&s;on to give credit, that God has thus declared, com|manded or forbidden, or that he has thus determined.</P>
<P>IT may plea&s;e God to reveal his truths or will <HI>imme|diately.</HI> For cannot the Father of Spirits, ever pre&s;ent with us, enlighten imperfect minds by his inward energy; and direct tho&s;e he &s;o conver&s;es with, how to di&s;tingui&s;h
<PB N="14" REF="010827_0012_0F81D381E3533E50">between divine communications, and the heights of an enthu&s;ia&s;tic fancy, or the illu&s;ions of depraved &s;pirits? He who denies this intercour&s;e between God and man, would or might, had he not &s;en&s;ible proof of the fact, ridicule it as an ab&s;urd whim&s;y, that a particular modification and undulation of the air &s;hould convey from one to an|other mind, ideas of the mo&s;t ab&s;tract propo&s;itions.</P>
<P>WHEN the Almighty <HI>mediately</HI> u&s;es in&s;truments, like our&s;elves, to convey his light and truth to us, they mu&s;t be able to give convincing evidence, that they re|ceived their me&s;&s;ages from God, and were ordered by him to publi&s;h them. The proof mu&s;t be &s;uch as &s;hall be perceived by tho&s;e to whom it is offered, and leave them no rea&s;on to doubt, but that what the&s;e me&s;&s;engers deliver, is really the "te&s;timony of God," or that which he in a wi&s;e and &s;ufficient manner te&s;tifies to the truth of.</P>
<P>THERE is no other avenue of moral or religious truth, but what may be aided and rendered more perfect by "faith." Thus when the Pagans heard the pure &s;en|timents of in&s;piration concerning the one true God, which laid before, if at all, yet in dark confu&s;ion in their minds, tho&s;e truths commanded their a&s;&s;ent, not merely on the credit of the preacher, but of their own intuitive truth.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">IN this view it is far from being true, that in order to one's receiving any benefit from holy &s;cripture, he mu&s;t be fir&s;t convinced of it's divine authority, for they may be a means them&s;elves of proving their original, and opening the mind to a thorough conviction thereof.</NOTE> Similar advantages may attend this way of communicat|ing truths, which tho' not before known, yet require but little tho't for conviction of their &s;olid foundation.</P>
<P>BUT in matters of rea&s;oning, the advantage of faith
<PB N="15" REF="010827_0013_0F81D3822E1C2B30">is &s;till more clearly vi&s;ible. For &s;uch is the natural im|perfection of the mind, &s;uch the depths of ignorance into which it may &s;ink, &s;uch its dullne&s;s in tho&s;e who for want of lei&s;ure or application are unu&s;ed to rational proce&s;&s;es, that innumerable doubts are re&s;olved, and diffi|culties removed, by the authority of a "thus &s;aith the Lord," which might otherwi&s;e perplex the &s;oul, and ren|der the practical influence of the mo&s;t weighty doctrines and advices nothing at all. E&s;pecially will the ca&s;e be &s;o with tho&s;e who cannot ab&s;tract, nor enter into the rea&s;on of things. And how many are they?</P>
<P>MOST of all, with re&s;pect to truths which depend on the &s;overeign wi&s;dom of God for their exi&s;tence, relative to &s;uch conduct of his, as we mu&s;t have otherwi&s;e been ignorant of, and yet it may highly concern us to know; there we plainly &s;ee that revelation from him, is the only method whereby we can be informed of them.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;umption therefore would be &s;trong, previ|ous to any trial, that if God in mercy &s;hould appear this way for men, whereby truth &s;hould enter their minds by an ea&s;y convincing proce&s;s, and motives to virtue pre&s;s with their full weight; real religion would be promot|ed and extended, in abundantly greater degrees, than by any different method. If therefore Chri&s;tianity in it's purity has had &s;uch an effect, a &s;trong argument of its divinity ari&s;es.&mdash;But leaving pre&s;umptions, I proceed,</P>
<P N="3">III. Chri&s;tianity is a &s;y&s;tem of truths, &s;peculative and practical, of the highe&s;t importance to men; our faith of which, <HI>properly &s;o called,</HI> or in it's &s;tricte&s;t definition, is
<PB N="16" REF="010827_0014_0F81D38336CCBF60">founded, and &s;tably &s;ounded, on the power of God, ex|ered for the purpo&s;e of demanding and inducing that faith.</P>
<P>THOUGH Chri&s;tianity is mo&s;t firmly founded on ar|gument, yet the go&s;pel is not merely a &s;y&s;tem of rea&s;on|ing. It takes for granted tho&s;e fir&s;t principles, which mu&s;t be fixed in the mind, before it can a&s;&s;ent to any thing, as having the authority of a divine revelation. It offers it&s;elf as a me&s;&s;age from the God of all grace to a dark and degenerate world. Men of penetration will indeed much &s;erve the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t, by their re&s;earch|es into the rational and moral foundation of many re|vealed truths, but it is by a per&s;ua&s;ion that they are the declarations of God, that we formally &s;ubmit to them and embrace them.</P>
<P>CHRISTIANITY is built on this foundation, that there is one only true and eternal God, the creator, &s;up|porter, ruler and judge of all, who is the "hater of ini|quity," but the "rewarder of tho&s;e that diligently &s;eek him", and that "man is his offspring."&mdash;And it teaches us that man was originally de&s;igned for immortality, while he maintained his innocence; but placed in &s;uch a rank of beings that he might offend, the natural fruit of which would be the encrea&s;ed power of vicious incli|nations; the judicial effect, death.&mdash;It a&s;&s;ures us, that man of his own free agency offended, vice propagated, and death took place.&mdash;But that in &s;uch a de&s;perate &s;itu|ation, the mercy of him who is pre&s;ented to us, not by terms which denote his ab&s;tract, metaphy&s;ical e&s;&s;ence, but which in&s;pire reverence and confidence, tempering the
<PB N="17" REF="010827_0015_0F81D383BA302DE0">&s;everity of a judge with the bowels of a father, provid|ed a method worthy of him&s;elf, whereupon the whole human race &s;hould again live, and be placed in various conditions of trial for an happy immortality.&mdash;That his &s;upreme wi&s;dom, which in all his works within our ob|&s;ervation, u&s;es &s;ubordinate means and in&s;truments to bring about his ends, appointed one per&s;on to be under him the &s;aviour of &s;inners, from the fir&s;t &s;tep of it in their being "turned from darkne&s;s to light," to his finally pre&s;enting them to his Father, as worthy of im|mortal honour and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>THIS great per&s;on is characterized, in terms in&s;piring reverence, love, and demanding all credit and confidence, as the "brightne&s;s of the Father's glory, the expre&s;s image of his per&s;on," who "was in the beginning with God, and is God." This Son of God in due time be|came incarnate, and employed life to the mo&s;t beneficent purpo&s;es of bringing men to God; which he e&s;pecially did, by in&s;tructing us in what it mo&s;t of all concerned us to know, and none but a me&s;&s;enger from God could in|form us of, viz. "That God was in him reconciling the world to him&s;elf," being di&s;po&s;ed to forgive &s;inners, and re&s;tore them, on gracious and equitable terms, to &s;uch ble&s;&s;ings as even un&s;potted innocence could not claim of right&mdash;that unfeigned repentance and the genuine fruits of it, "&s;obriety, righteou&s;ne&s;s and godline&s;s," are the terms of that covenant of grace, whereby we are re|newed to hope. He has furni&s;hed us with every motive which can work on a cautious or generous mind, above all with the pro&s;pect of the future terrors of the Lord, and "the ble&s;&s;ed hope of the glorious appearing of the
<PB N="18" REF="010827_0016_0F81D3847AE9D920">great God and our &s;aviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The&s;e &s;olemn futurities he has di&s;tinctly and frequently &s;et before us.</P>
<P>AND to the end that none &s;hould from this di&s;play of unde&s;erved mercy, pre&s;ume upon ea&s;y pardon, but might, when they gratefully own the benefits, reverence the pu|rity of God and fear before him; for the&s;e, I &s;ay, among other intentions, the death of Chri&s;t, a mo&s;t memorable event, is declared to be of the nature of a ran&s;om, a &s;a|crifice, which having been once offered to God, every mea&s;ure of mercy thenceforth con&s;i&s;ted with the recto|ral holine&s;s of the Lord of men and angels. At the &s;ame time the divine love of &s;anctity has been illu&s;triou&s;ly &s;hewn, in the noble reward of the per&s;evering obedience of Je&s;us, who was therefore exalted to all power, that he might have full &s;cope to exerci&s;e that &s;ublime friend&s;hip to men, which by dying for them he proved was near his heart.</P>
<P>JESUS is "head over all things to the church." He promotes his cau&s;e by the wi&s;e&s;t means. He fir&s;t &s;ent forth mini&s;ters to propagate it, armed with the power of God. He fixed con&s;titutions and ordinances, to derive on it all the advantages of religious &s;ociety. And he is the di&s;pen&s;er, under God, of that internal in|fluence, re&s;pecting the real di&s;po&s;itions of men, whereby, in &s;pite of weakne&s;s and corruption, they avail them|&s;elves of the means of repentance and virtue; whereby they are "born of God", and become, in the worthie&s;t &s;en&s;e, the "Sons of God."</P>
<P>THE immediate agent here, is a divine per&s;on, term|ed "the Spirit of God", who&s;e perfections and office demand our veneration and dependance.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="010827_0017_0F81D385A99C5800">
THE exalted Je&s;us is to maintain this po&s;t of dignity, till the ends of wi&s;dom in this &s;tate of things is an&s;wered. Then the &s;cene &s;hall be clo&s;ed; all the&s;e &s;ubordinations &s;hall cea&s;e; and "God &s;hall be all in all."</P>
<P>I HAVE given this <HI>compendium</HI> of Chri&s;tianity <HI>properly &s;o called,</HI> to collect in one view tho&s;e important articles, which evidently need other proof than the "wi&s;dom of men"; they are the chief parts of the admini&s;trations of God, with which our welfare is connected. To a&s;k, why there are &s;uch, rather than of a different nature or form, is a que&s;tion which only pride and petulance would dare to a&s;k. The only proper enquiry is, are they really &s;uch? And the an&s;wer to this que&s;tion, which is our "faith, &s;tandeth not in the wi&s;dom of men, but in the power of God."</P>
<P>THE wi&s;dom of man may be challenged to contrive a more proper way, to reveal &s;uch things, and induce the belief of them, than the &s;ending me&s;&s;engers to declare them, and to give tho&s;e they were &s;ent to, full evidence that the&s;e mini&s;ters of God were &s;pecially charged with them by him; that what they &s;pake was not their own, but his who &s;ent them. That this is the ca&s;e with re&s;pect to Chri&s;tianity, I now proceed briefly to illu&s;trate and con|firm, which will compleat our &s;ubject.</P>
<P>THAT Je&s;us, "the author and fini&s;her of our faith," (for I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to him) wrought, not one or a few, but a continued &s;eries of miraculous works, is a truth of fact as fully proved, as any one of that kind can be.&mdash;They were many,&mdash;indi&s;putably be&s;ide the cour&s;e
<PB N="20" REF="010827_0018_0F81D38608134E78">of nature, and beyond human power,&mdash;done in a man|ner which evinced their reality,&mdash;in places of con&s;picu|ous re&s;ort, and with public appeals to the &s;pectators. And to complete the &s;eries, he aro&s;e from the dead him&s;elf, according to his own prediction and declaration. The&s;e were facts, which his wor&s;t enemies who were contempo|rary with them, &s;agacious, engaged in intere&s;t and incli|nation to deny if they could, yet denied not. Numbers of more impartial minds, eye-witne&s;&s;es of them, were con|vinced, for they became his di&s;ciples. His own re&s;ur|rection was by the effects of it e&s;pecially made &s;o certain, that the continuance and &s;ucce&s;s of his cau&s;e can by no po&s;&s;ibility be accounted for, but by the reality of that re&s;urrection. For con&s;idering the oppo&s;ition of preju|dice, of philo&s;ophy, of lu&s;t, of the &s;ecular arm; thro' their combined influence it mu&s;t have declined and died, if this capital fact had not been true; or, to adopt the &s;ingular language of a &s;ubtle enemy of our faith, it's &s;uc|ce&s;s mu&s;t have been an infinitely greater miracle than any on which it profe&s;&s;ed to be founded; and therefore, according to the doctrine of Mr. <HI>Hume,</HI> the reality of the&s;e miracles mu&s;t be a&s;&s;uredly believed.</P>
<P>JESUS, when he wro't the&s;e works, ever affirmed that he did them by the power of God; and appealed to them as that evidence which the great God and Father of all offered, for the conviction of all who &s;aw them, or &s;hould have credible te&s;timony of them; that all his doctrines and in&s;tructions were divine truths, and &s;uch truths as God had commi&s;&s;ioned him to publi&s;h to the world. The con&s;equence is ungain&s;ayable; that if the power of God was therein manife&s;ted to the very end of
<PB N="21" REF="010827_0019_0F81D386AA755E98">inducing faith of the truth of Je&s;us, we ought to hear him, to attend to, and embrace what he delivered, as firmly as though we heard them by "a voice from the heavenly glory."</P>
<P>To prove that it was &s;o, what &s;hall be &s;aid? Power far &s;uperior to that of the vi&s;ible agent, was certainly exerted. The agent declared, that was "the power of God." And did Je&s;us ever &s;hew a &s;ymptom of deceit or fal&s;hood? Did he not give the &s;tronge&s;t proofs of veracity and integrity? Was not the de&s;ign and ten|dency of his &s;y&s;tem worthy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> God to interpo&s;e in favour of? Superior beings, one at lea&s;t, were certainly con|cerned in the&s;e marvellous works. Were they evil ones? Read Chri&s;t's argument, infidel! in Matth. XV. 25. and be &s;ilent. Were they good ones? They could not then combine with an impo&s;tor. Nor would the God of love &s;uffer an impo&s;ition on his poor creatures, which they &s;hould have no rea&s;onable means of detecting. They mu&s;t therefore have been the mini&s;ters of God; the power in the la&s;t re&s;ort is his. Let any &s;ober mind reflect on the uniform, plain and high Tendency of Chri&s;tianity, to honour the God of purity and mercy, and to enlighten, purify, and ennoble the nature of men; let him review what it enjoins on us at pre&s;ent, and teaches us to expect hereafter; and will he, can he doubt whence it's origin, and who &s;ealed it's truth? Could we tran&s;port our&s;elves back to the times and places, where he "who went about doing good," healed the &s;ick and rai&s;ed the dead; could we then have mixed with the admiring multitude; could we have followed him, and hear the gracious words which proceeded from his
<PB N="22" REF="010827_0020_0F81D389C16C26A8">lips; could we hear him &s;ay, "The words which I &s;peak are not mine, but the Father's which &s;ent me, and "if ye believe not for my words, yet believe for the work's &s;ake;" &s;hould we not without he&s;itation have owned him in his true character, unle&s;s perhaps a yet depraved mind had tempted us, by &s;ubtle fine&s;&s;e and the &s;ophi&s;tic deceitfulne&s;s of &s;in, to leave the plain &s;entiments of common &s;en&s;e and judgment, and to deceive our own &s;elves. Would not infidelity have been beaten out of every entrenchment? Mu&s;t we not have been forced to own, "&s;urely this man is the Son of God?"</P>
<P>THUS much mu&s;t &s;erve for the illu&s;tration and con|firmation of our text, &s;o de&s;criptive of the foundation of Chri&s;tianity, properly &s;o called. Not that I would be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;et up miracles as the only proof of it's truth. The excellency of the moral part of our religion&mdash;the agreement of what is merely revealed with our natural ideas of the holine&s;s, mercy and &s;overeign wi&s;dom of God&mdash;it's improving upon former di&s;pen&s;ations of heaven&mdash;the accompli&s;hment of ancient prophecies&mdash; the propagation of this cau&s;e in &s;pite of all oppo&s;ition.&mdash; All the&s;e and others are arguments of great weight. But they exceed the bounds of one di&s;cour&s;e. And after all, this of miracles is the capital proof in the ca&s;e, which the founder of our faith laid the greate&s;t &s;tre&s;s upon. Take away this, the foundation is comparatively &s;lender; lay this ba&s;is, it will &s;upport whatever you ju&s;tly build upon it, though collateral props were removed. For hereby he who delivered things worthy of God, proved that he came from God.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="010827_0021_0F81D38A7B370308">
THE credibility of the go&s;pel hi&s;tory, whereon we depend for the reality of the&s;e wonders, and all &s;ub&s;e|quent ones wrought by the fir&s;t mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, is al&s;o a di&s;tinct &s;ubject, capable of convincing proof, but mu&s;t be now omitted.</P>
<P>I CONCLUDE with &s;ome REFLECTIONS.&mdash;And,</P>
<P N="1">1. AN oppo&s;er of our religion might well be a&s;ked, whether he could lay his hand on his heart, and &s;ay his de&s;ign was friendly to mankind. If he &s;hould &s;ucceed in his endeavours to evert it, has he a clearer &s;y&s;tem of theology to propo&s;e, better rules of, or higher motives to private and &s;ocial virtue? Has he a more efficacious plan to lay, for promoting the honour of God, and good of men? Or can he relieve our ignorance, and point out the de&s;igns of God to us? Let the writings of mo|dern infidels an&s;wer the&s;e que&s;tions. If then in propor|tion as one weakens the faith of Chri&s;tianity, he hurts the intere&s;ts of peace and order, virtue and happine&s;s, is not the pre&s;umption violent, that he is wrong? What a heart or what a head mu&s;t he have, to labour to over|throw the be&s;t foundation of virtue, and place in its &s;tead a vague, heartle&s;s &s;y&s;tem, which every one may garble, according to his ta&s;te or prejudices. Men of this turn have rea&s;on to examine them&s;elves clo&s;ely, what &s;pirit they are of; for truth comes not "to de&s;troy men, but to &s;ave them."</P>
<P N="2">2. IT ought to be remarked as an in&s;tance of the wi&s;|dom and goodne&s;s of God, that the evidence of mira|cles is extremely well adapted to the working faith in the plain and &s;imple, and for them, as being the body of
<PB N="24" REF="010827_0022_0F81D38B2A62B158">mankind, the go&s;pel was chiefly de&s;igned. Had it been intended only for the "di&s;puter," "the wi&s;e man," it might perhaps have been confirmed in another man|ner. But the people cannot ab&s;tract much, they cannot draw far-fetched inferences, they are expo&s;ed to err, and lo&s;e them&s;elves when they attempt it. But they can &s;ee. Experience has informed them what is beyond human power. When, therefore, they &s;ee works done far be|yond it, and the agent &s;ays, "The&s;e I do to prove that God is with me;" they can infer as certainly as the &s;hrewde&s;t philo&s;opher, "this is the finger of God"; this man could not do the&s;e things, except God were with him: And on the other hand, were &s;uch proof adduced in favour of fal&s;hood and hurtful opinions, they can &s;ay, either the&s;e are juggling frauds, or an enemy to God and goodne&s;s hath done this. But the nature of Chri&s;ti|anity is &s;uch, that this la&s;t comes not in que&s;tion; it's &s;pirit breathes "glory to God in the highe&s;t, peace on earth, good will to and among men."</P>
<P N="3">3. FROM this la&s;t remark, I am led to another, nor very foreign from it: It is this, Chri&s;tianity, properly &s;o called, deals very little in metaphy&s;ics or any ab&s;tru&s;e &s;ci|ence. It is de&s;igned for the high benefit of tho&s;e of common under&s;tanding, of babes. Of "God the eternal &s;pirit," it declares not the phy&s;ical e&s;&s;ence, but his attributes; it pre&s;ents him to us as a creator, lord, judge and father; and from our ideas of the&s;e relations, excites us to every becoming affection towards him. "The ble&s;&s;ed Trinity" is not therein de&s;cribed by the doctrine of triangles, or of the emanation of light from the &s;un; but it teaches us the per&s;onal properties of the Sacred Three, whom we
<PB N="25" REF="010827_0023_0F81D38BEB987A08">adore, and on whom we depend. Beyond the&s;e we ought not, nor can we proceed in our &s;peculations. The go&s;pel relieves entirely under philo&s;ophical perplexities, concerning moral liberty and nece&s;&s;ity; for when one, by applying the properties of mechanical powers to the rea&s;onable mind, has argued him&s;elf or others out of all &s;en&s;e of moral obligation, and reduced him&s;elf or them to be the pa&s;&s;ive &s;ubjects of foreign impul&s;e; if then he turn to the go&s;pel, he will find &s;uch a manner of addre&s;s to him&s;elf and all, as is agreeable to that freedom he was intuitively con&s;cious of, until too ab&s;tracted reveries cau|&s;ed "the light within him to be darkne&s;s." Je&s;us proved him&s;elf to be the way, the truth, and the life; his authority is deci&s;ive; the limits of his di&s;coveries the wi&s;e&s;t. And here may I take the liberty to men|tion it, as an u&s;eful caution to <HI>my young brethren,</HI> the &s;tu|dents of this &s;ociety, e&s;epcially tho&s;e who are de&s;igned for the pulpit, to beware of relying on the wi&s;dom of men, or the re&s;earches of human &s;agacity, where revela|tion ought to be their only guide. There was a time when the <HI>Dogma's</HI> of &s;choolmen and monks were deemed &s;ound rules of expo&s;ition of the go&s;pel. Departure from them was con&s;trued to be a departure from the analogy of faith. Their u&s;urpation has declined. We &s;hall act as wrong, and hazard as much, if we put in their place the <HI>Dogma's</HI> of philo&s;ophy. Fix therefore in your minds the de&s;ign and extent of revelation, and receive it's truths from the mouth of its divine author. Particularly in the article ju&s;t now referred to. There has been a good deal of controver&s;y of late, re&s;pecting human power and weakne&s;s, of the unregenerate in par|ticular; and here and there a text has been &s;uppo&s;ed to
<PB N="26" REF="010827_0024_0F81D38CAF0815B8">favour metaphy&s;ical tenets, contrary to the general tenor of the go&s;pel, as well as to our own intimate con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s. Let others perplex them&s;elves about an unfru&s;tra|ble &s;eries of motives operating on the mind; but do you &s;tudy the whole go&s;pel; a&s;k your&s;elves, who was its author? whom does he addre&s;s? and in what man|ner? and you will be quite ea&s;y. He who &s;peaks there, could not u&s;e a vain, deceitful or en&s;naring addre&s;s. The con&s;equence is plain. Come to Chri&s;t then for light. None teacheth like him. Preach as he did, and you will be "workers together with him". You will have no drawbacks upon your zeal in per&s;uading &s;inners to repentance; nor pull down with one hand, what you build up with the other.</P>
<P N="4">4. Let us be grateful to God for his di&s;tingui&s;hing goodne&s;s to us, that we have &s;uch a &s;ure foundation of our faith, &s;uch high advantages for virtue and happine&s;s. To this end, let us compare our &s;ituation with that of tho&s;e who lived before Chri&s;t appeared, or who now "&s;it in darkne&s;s." And whatever infidels may &s;ugge&s;t, we may have &s;uch re&s;entment, without any di&s;honoura|ble imputation on the &s;overeign di&s;pen&s;er of his own gifts. "Shall our eye be evil, becau&s;e he is good"? In&s;tead of prai&s;ing him for what we enjoy, &s;hall we tax him with cruelty becau&s;e all enjoy not the &s;ame? How ba&s;e! Shall an angel murmur, becau&s;e man ranks not &s;o high as he! A man, becau&s;e he is preferred to brutes! One man becau&s;e he has a better capacity, or more external goods, than another;! "Is it not right that the Lord of all &s;hould do what he will with his own"! But the go&s;pel does not leave us here. It is the doctrine
<PB N="27" REF="010827_0025_0F81D38DA9383B18">of Chri&s;tianity, <HI>properly &s;o called,</HI> that Chri&s;t died for all, that all the human race may have great benefit from his redemption. This is not inferred from the word <HI>All,</HI> not from a &s;ingle, detached word, but from the pro|fe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign of his undertaking for men; which was, according to the will of the univer&s;al Father and Lord, to procure a general re&s;urrection, to the end that all may be tried (in the manner the wi&s;dom of God &s;ees fit) and be judged according to the deeds done in the body. Different religious advantages are various talents put into men's hands to improve. Some have one com|mitted to them, &s;ome ten. Fidelity in the improve|ment of one, will be accepted and rewarded. The good improvement of ten, will receive a much more excellent reward. If any improve not the one talent, God will be righteous when he judgeth. May he not indulge al&s;o to generous benevolence. Leave then our fellow|men to God, and &s;top not the &s;prings of gratitude by gloomy, uncertain &s;peculations.</P>
<P>LASTLY, Let us aim at ju&s;t apprehen&s;ions of the nature and evidence of Chri&s;tianity, that it may lie clearly in our minds; that we may be able to defend it &s;ucce&s;s|fully again&s;t gain-&s;ayers; and that it may become the power of God unto &s;alvation to us. Let us therefore apply to &s;erious con&s;ideration, and &s;earch the &s;criptures; e&s;pecially deliberately &s;tudy the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t; and to all our endeavours add con&s;tant prayers to the Father of lights, to enlighten and direct us, that we may be made wi&s;e to &s;alvation. Tho' I do not think that the apo&s;tle, in our text, meant, by the "power of God," an inward influence upon the mind, yet it is a Chri&s;tian
<PB N="28" REF="010827_0026_0F81D38E2A1DB530">doctrine, that "if any man lack wi&s;dom, he &s;hould a&s;k it of God, who giveth his &s;pirit of light and truth to tho&s;e who a&s;k him." E&s;pecially let us &s;ee to it, if we would be under his direction, that our aims be right and good. The great end of &s;peculation is that practice may be guided and influenced. And our Lord has promi&s;ed. "if any man will do his will, he &s;hall know of the doctrine whether it be of God."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xvii. 7.</NOTE> Let that then be our chief inducement in labouring to be grounded in the faith, which was the chief de&s;ign of the go&s;pel hi&s;tory it&s;elf; the&s;e books were written, that ye might believe that Je&s;us is the Chri&s;t, the Son of God, and that be|lieving ye might have life thro' him." John xx. 31.</P>
