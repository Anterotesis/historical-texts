<P>_WAR is one of the bitter Fruits and deplorable Effects of the Apo&s;tacy and Degeneracy of the human Species: It originates or takes its Ri&s;e from the Lu&s;ts of Men, from Pride, Selfi&s;hne&s;s, Malevolence, Envy, Avarice, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> as appears from tho&s;e Words of In&s;piration, <HI>James</HI> iv. 5. <HI>From whence come Wars and Fightings?</HI> &amp;c. and 'tis one of the &s;ore Judgments and Rebukes wherewith the Holy GOD corrects Man for his Iniquity. Altho' the Kingdom of Chri&s;t is a Kingdom of Peace, and his Go&s;pel breathes Nothing but univer&s;al Love and Benevolence; in&s;omuch that had all Men Faith, and were actuated and govern'd by the noble Principles
<PB N="2" REF="007576_0004_102D7C36A7FB9880">and Maxims of moral Truth and Duty, reveal'd and e&s;tabli&s;h'd in the Go&s;pel, every Man might fit under his own Vine and Fig-Tree, and there would be none to terrify or mole&s;t him: <HI>Ephraim would not envy Judah, nor Judah vex Ephraim:</HI> Men might then <HI>beat</HI> up <HI>their Swords into Plow&s;hares, and learn War no more;</HI> for in Con&s;equence of this, Wars would cea&s;e to the Ends of the Earth. Yet ever &s;ince the ancient Enmity was put be|tween the Seed of the Serpent and the Woman, <HI>Peace has been taken from the Earth,</HI> and Nation has been ri&s;ing up again&s;t Nation: <HI>The Serpent has been ca&s;ting out of his Mouth Water as a Flood after the Woman, that he might cau&s;e her to be carried away of the Flood: The Dragon</HI> has all along been <HI>wroth with the Woman,</HI> viz. the Church of God in the World, and been <HI>making War with the Remnant of her Seed, which keep the Commandments of God, and have the Te&s;timony of</HI> JESUS CHRIST.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rev.</HI> xii. 15, 17.</NOTE> <HI>Cain,</HI> who mortally hated, and embrued his Hands in the Blood of righteous <HI>Abel,</HI> his Brother, has left behind him Numbers in his cur&s;ed Image, po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd of tho&s;e diabolical Di&s;tempers of Pride, Malice, Envy, and &s;uch like, who have hated God's Zion, and been attempting to ra&s;e it to the Foundation thereof. We have a very remarkable Specimen of this <HI>Cainine</HI> Temper and ho&s;tile Spirit, in the unrea&s;onable, in&s;ulting and tyran|nical Demands and Expectations of tho&s;e recorded 1 <HI>Kings</HI> xx. Men there have been, from Age to Age, and now are, who <HI>are Lovers of their own &s;elves, covetous, proud, Truce-breakers, fal&s;e Accu&s;ers, and the&s;e make the Times perillous:</HI> For to the Wills

And &s;ince 'tis &s;o, and the Adver&s;ary will hearken to no Rule or Rea&s;on, and are entirely addicted to Violence and Oppre&s;&s;ion; the Law and Light of Nature and of GOD, will allow, yea, it requires repelling of Force by Force. In this Ca&s;e, 'tis evidently the Mind and Will of God, that his People make military Preparations; labour to furni&s;h them|&s;elves with Skill in the Art military; whet and &s;urbi&s;h their Swords; file off the Ru&s;t of their Firelocks, that exqui&s;itely-contriv'd Engine of Terror, and tremendous In&s;trument of Death; and as Volunteers go forth to the Help of the

'Tis true, we &s;hould likewi&s;e beware of the other Extream, and not &s;ymbolize with them, who in a Way of Di&s;tru&s;t of GOD, <HI>went down to AEgypt for Help, and &s;tay'd on Hor&s;es, and tru&s;ted in Chariots, becau&s;e they were many, and in Hor&s;emen, becau&s;e they were &s;trong; but look'd not to the Holy One of I&s;rael, neither &s;ought the</HI> LORD:
<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>I&s;aiah</HI> xxxi. 1.</NOTE> But with a due Depen|dance on the Power that made us, and is the great Pre&s;erver of Men; when Things are come to this Cri&s;is, we ought to put our&s;elves into a Po&s;ture of Defence, prepare for War, be clad in our Regimentals, every Man of the Valiant of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> having his Sword upon his Thigh, bran|di&s;hing the glittering Spear, the Dart, and the Habergeon, and laying at the Enemy, attempting
<PB N="5" REF="007576_0007_102D7C3E212F21E8">hereby to humble their Pride, tame their Madne&s;s, and oblige them to yield or die! Now it behoves the Officers and Infantry, like General <HI>Joab,</HI> and his Battallions, to <HI>be of good Courage, and play the Men for this People, and for the Cities of their GOD.</HI></P>
<P>That there may be ju&s;t Occa&s;ion for a People profe&s;&s;ing Godline&s;s to arm them&s;elves, and en|gage in a defen&s;ive War again&s;t their Enemies, can't be denied, without offering Violence to Rea&s;on, and wre&s;ting the Scriptures. The Affronts and Abu&s;es offer'd to King <HI>David</HI> and his Men, by the Children of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> related in our Context, were intolerable; and hence we find <HI>Joab</HI> the General, charging his armed Bands to be of good Courage, <HI>and play the Men,</HI> &amp;c. And if any will not own that <HI>Joab</HI> was a good Man; yet they mu&s;t grant, that he here &s;peaks as became one of a noble and martial Spirit, and an experienced valiant Leader of the Armies of <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> yea, and as became a pious General too; for he adds, <HI>and the LORD do that which &s;eemeth him good: q. d.</HI> <Q>Let us do our Parts, and quietly refer our&s;elves and the Event to God's good Plea&s;ure, which we have no Rea&s;on to di&s;tru&s;t; the War on our Part being ju&s;t, and not vainly undertaken to enlarge our Empire, or aggran|dize our&s;elves, but for our own ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary Defence: 'Tis for our People, and for the Cities of our GOD, that we are now called to &s;ight; for the Pre&s;ervation of them from that Ruin which our Enemies de&s;ign for us; the Cities which are devoted to his Wor&s;hip and Service; and therefore we may hope for GOD's Pre&s;ence, Ble&s;&s;ing and A&s;&s;i&s;tance in it; that he will plead
<PB N="6" REF="007576_0008_102D7C408279FCC8">their Cau&s;e, and be on our Side.</Q> 'Twas un|doubtedly their Duty to do as they did; and why not equally ours, when in &s;imilar Circum|&s;tances? &mdash; it being plainly and infinitely impo&s;|&s;ible for that ever to cea&s;e being a Duty, which is founded in and re&s;ults from the eternal unal|terable Nature, Rea&s;on and moral Fitne&s;s of Things. The Example of <HI>Lai&s;h</HI> is written for our Admonition; <HI>Judges</HI> xviii. 27, 28. <HI>And they took the Things which</HI> Micah <HI>had made, and the Prie&s;t which be had, and came unto</HI> Lai&s;h, <HI>unto a People that were at quiet, and &s;ecure; and they &s;mote them with the Edge of the Sword, and burnt the City with Fire: And there was no Deliverer, becau&s;e it was far from</HI> Zidon, <HI>and they had no Bu&s;ine&s;s with any Man.</HI> St. <HI>Paul</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, that <HI>all Scripture given by Divine In&s;piration is profitable for In&s;truction;</HI> and that <HI>what &s;oever was written afore-time, was written for our Learning.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore take Occa&s;ion from the Words of my Text, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> to characterize or de&s;cribe, and <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> to excite the good Soldier.</P>
<P>I am then, in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Place, to de&s;cribe, or give a brief Sketch of the Character of the good Soldier. And in general, he is One that is of good Courage, and when call'd hereto, plays the Man for his People, and for the Cities of his GOD. And if we come to Particulars, the&s;e following Things, I conceive, go to make up, and compleat the Character of a good Soldier.</P>
<P N="1">1. He mu&s;t be of a martial Genius, of a bold and heroick Spirit, and well furni&s;hed with military Knowledge or Skill in the Art of War.
<PB N="7" REF="007576_0009_102D7187B078C0A0">If Courage or Conduct be wanting, whether it be in the Officers or Soldiers, what Pro&s;pect can there be of their copying the Example of <HI>Joab,</HI> or his Warriors? of their being a Safeguard and Defence to their Country, and thence an&s;wering the principal End and De&s;ign of their In&s;titution and Calling? 'Tis required in Soldiers, e&s;pecially in their Leaders and chief Officers, that they be well acquainted with what belongs to the Art-Military; that &s;o they may be able, in the be&s;t Manner, to attack and oppo&s;e, battle, and rout, and vanqui&s;h the Enemy. One that is a Soldier ought to under&s;tand the Words of Command; the &s;everal Beats of that great warlike In&s;trument the Drum, together with the Language of the &s;hrill high-&s;ounding Trumpet, that noble, reviv|ing and animating Sound: Soldiers ought to under&s;tand how to march regularly; keep their Ranks and Files; what are the proper Facings; how to make good the Ground; when to advance or &s;tand, or turn the Sway of Battle; when to open or clo&s;e the grim Ridges of War, and how to make a regular, advantageous and &s;afe Retreat, as there may be occa&s;ion: They ought to be acquainted with the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t Methods of Encamping, of Entrenchment or Circumvalla|tion, of Fortification, of erecting Batteries, Forts, Garri&s;ens or Ca&s;tles, of battering down or &s;caling Walls and Ramparts, and thence forcing the Enemy to &s;urrender, and &s;ubmit them&s;elves. <HI>Joel</HI> ii. 7, 8, 9. <HI>They &s;hall run like mighty Men; they &s;hall climb the Wall like Men of War, and they &s;hall march every one on his Ways, and they &s;hall not break their Ranks, neither &s;hall one thru&s;t another;
<PB N="8" REF="007576_0010_102D7C4212216738">they &s;hall run to and fro in the City; they &s;hall run upon the Wall; they &s;hall climb up upon the Hou&s;es; they &s;hall enter in at the Windows.</HI> Knowledge and Under&s;tanding in the&s;e Things, will in&s;pire Courage; whereas the Want of it tends to inti|midate, di&s;animate, and render Men pu&s;illanimous and cowardly; and Cowardice evermore cuts the Nerves and Sinews of adventurous Attempts.</P>
<P N="2">2. Furthermore, 'tis required in Soldiers, that they be not only Men of Courage and Conduct, of martial Accompli&s;hments, of Activity, and an enterprizing Genius; but that they be loyal to their King, and Lovers of their Country: Of this we have <HI>Joab,</HI> and his valiant Soldiers, for an Example.</P>
<P N="3">3. A Soldier &s;hould be a Man of Religion, a Chri&s;tian Temper of Mind and Conduct, a pure Con&s;cience, an upright &s;elf-approving Mind, Faith, and a good Life: This al&s;o contributes towards making them of good Courage, and prompting them to <HI>play the Men for</HI> their <HI>People, and for the Cities of their GOD.</HI> A &s;trict Regard to Di&s;cipline and good Order, Temperance, Sobriety, Mortification and Self-Denial, and good Decorum, is no &s;mall Embelli&s;hment to the Character of them that are in the Militia, and wear the honorary Title of Soldiers, and tends to make them, under GOD, our <HI>Decus ac Tutamen,</HI> our Glory and our Defence. Faith and Religion in an Army, mu&s;t needs have a great Tendency to engage the Divine Pre&s;ence with them, without which they can expect little Succe&s;s. This makes them <HI>&s;trong and very couragious, bolder than Lions, &s;wifter than Eagles;</HI> now they <HI>wax valiant in Fight,
<PB N="9" REF="007576_0011_102D7C45BAC25FA8">and put to Flight the Armies of the Aliens:</HI> Like David, <HI>run thro' a Troop, and leap over a Wall; pur&s;ue their Enemies, and overtake them; beat them &s;mall as the Du&s;t, and tread them down as Mire in the Streets:</HI> Now <HI>One cha&s;es a Thou&s;and, and Ten put ten Thou&s;and to Flight.</HI> A &s;trict and &s;acred Regard to Truth and Hone&s;ty, Ju&s;tice and Equity, in a Soldier, has a mighty Tendency to fill his Heart with Courage and Valour. A Soldier that is a Man of Religion, a devout Man, a Man of Prayer, a ju&s;t Man, one that can rule his own Spirit, bridle and govern his Tongue, keep under his Body, and bring it into Subjection, and is &s;ober, cha&s;te and temperate in all Things, will not be a&s;ham'd or afraid; but will <HI>&s;peak with the Enemies in the Gate;</HI> will not fear to look his Enemy in the Face, to &s;tand Foot to Foot, and mea&s;ure Arms with him; for he doth not <HI>fear Death with any Amazement.</HI></P>
<P>That the true Knowledge of God, and Tru&s;t in him, is one needful Qualification of a Soldier, is plain from <HI>Dan.</HI> xi. 32. <HI>The People that do know their GOD, &s;hall be &s;trong, and do Exploits:</HI> The Oppo&s;ite to the&s;e are &s;uch as <HI>do wickedly again&s;t the Covenant,</HI> and may be corrupted by Flattery or Bribery, to &s;erve the Wor&s;t of Intere&s;ts, to engage with the Vile&s;t of Men, to promote their wicked De&s;igns, to join with Antichri&s;t in per|petrating the greate&s;t Barbarities and Cruelties, under Pretences of Religion, thinking they are doing God Service, while they are killing his Children.</P>
<P>Since it is evident, that the Calling and Bu&s;ine&s;s of Soldiers is what Chri&s;tianity allows, and gives
<PB N="10" REF="007576_0012_102D7C47B688E830">Countenance to; &s;ince to be a Soldier, and fight the LORD's Battles, is not incon&s;i&s;tent with the Character and Life of a Chri&s;tian, every Soldier ought to be a Chri&s;tian, and in Behaviour as becometh Holine&s;s. He that, under the Light of Revelation, lacketh the&s;e Things, hath <HI>denied the Faith, and is wor&s;e than an Infidel.</HI> The Holy Gho&s;t directs all, and con&s;equently Soldiers, <HI>to take to 'em the whole Armour of God, to &s;tand having their Loins girt about with Truth, and having on the Brea&s;t-plate of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and their Feet &s;hod with the Preparation of the Go&s;pel, taking the Shield of Faith, the Helmet of Salvation, and the Sword of the Spirit, which is the World of God; praying always with all Prayer and Supplication, in the Spirit;</HI> and in the Exerci&s;e of the&s;e military Virtues, faithfully to employ them&s;elves fighting again&s;t not only <HI>Fle&s;h and Blood, but Principalities and Powers, and the Rulers of the Darkne&s;s of this World, and &s;piritual Wickedne&s;&s;es in high Places, till they have overcome thro' the Blood of the Lamb; are Conquerors, and more than Conquerors, thro' him that hath loved us.</HI> And to in&s;truct us, that Soldiers ought to be Men of Piety and Virtue, mu&s;t needs be the De&s;ign of the Spirit of Truth, in tran&s;mitting down to us, in the &s;acred Records, the Examples of &s;o many famous and renowned Warriors, who feared God and kept his Precepts, who <HI>thro' Faith &s;ubdued Kingdoms, quenched the Violence of Fire, e&s;caped the Edge of the Sword, out of Weakne&s;s were made &s;trong, waxed valiant in Fight,</HI> &amp;c. The Example of <HI>Abraham,</HI> for In&s;tance, the Friend of God, who&s;e Victory, and triumphant Return from the Slaughter of the four Kings,
<PB N="11" REF="007576_0013_102D7C4994192440">accompanied with his &s;mall but brave and gallant Train-band, is recorded to his immortal Honour; &mdash;the Example of <HI>David,</HI> the Man after God's own Heart, who made <HI>God his Tru&s;t from his Youth,</HI> and was al&s;o <HI>a Man of War from his Youth,</HI> who <HI>through God did valiantly, and trod down his Enemies;</HI> &mdash;the Example of that pious young Hero King <HI>Jo&s;iah,</HI> who for the Sake of his People, and the Cities of his God, jeopardiz'd his Life, and even &s;acrificed it in a Battle of the Warriors, attended with <HI>confu&s;ed Noi&s;e, and Garments rolled in Blood.</HI>&mdash; And what &s;hall I more &s;ay? for the Time would &s;ail me, to tell of <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> of <HI>Gideon,</HI> of <HI>Barak,</HI> of <HI>Samp&s;on,</HI> and of <HI>Jephthe,</HI> and many others, who&s;e &s;ignal Courage and wife Conduct, and remarkable Succe&s;&s;es, were undoubtedly in no &s;mail Mea&s;ure, owing to their Faith and Hope in GOD, and to their being under the governing Influence of Religion, fearing God, and keeping his Ways. And whoever con&s;iders the Directions given to the Soldiers by <HI>John the Bapti&s;t,</HI> mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that this is one Thing requi&s;ite to fini&s;h the Cha|racter of one that will be likely to <HI>play the Man,</HI> and act the Part of a good Soldier.</P>
<P N="4">4. As Soldiers would be what they ought to be, and act in Character, they mu&s;t be di&s;po&s;ed to obey their Leaders and commanding Officers. Murmurings and Mutinies among Soldiers, and Rebellion, which is as the Sin of Witchcraft, mu&s;t needs be an ill Omen, and have a dark, threatning and di&s;a&s;terous A&s;pect upon the Succe&s;s of the Campaign. If Soldiers de&s;ert their Po&s;t, or fly from their Colours, or de&s;pi&s;e to obey their Commanders; Defeat and Lo&s;s of Victory, mu&s;t
<PB N="12" REF="007576_0014_102D7C4C02F69738">needs en&s;ue: Nor is the Rebel &s;afe; but is awfully expos'd to an untimely Death; to be like <HI>Ab&s;alom</HI> &s;uddenly cha&s;ed out of the World, and driven into Darkne&s;s: He has ju&s;t Ground to fear, that Vengeance will not &s;uffer him to live; &mdash; that he &s;hall be devoured with the Sword, or by &s;ome other Means be forced <HI>to de&s;cend to Hell, with all his Weapons of War;</HI>
<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ezek.</HI></NOTE> and that his <HI>Sins will lye down with him in the Du&s;t;</HI>

Is not that written for our Admonition, <HI>Judges</HI> v. 15, 16, 17. <HI>For the Divi&s;ions of</HI> Reuben <HI>there were great Thought; of Heart: Why abode&s;t thou among the Sheep-folds, to bear the Bleatings of the Flocks?
