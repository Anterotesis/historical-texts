<HEAD>The Means, Nature, Properties and Effects of true Faith.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In a<HI> SERMON </HI>preached at<HI> Hor&s;lydown, </HI>the 24th day of December 1738, in a meeting of the people called<HI> Quakers, </HI>by Mr.<HI> Thomas Story.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is written in the holy &s;cripture. That "without faith it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God," which I think plainly implies, that by faith we may plea&s;e him. And if we &s;hould be &s;o injurious to the divine attributes, and hurtful to our&s;elves in our highe&s;t intere&s;ts, as to think of the Almighty, that he is &s;uch a Being as that we can never plea&s;e him, or to conceive an indi&s;|pen&s;ible duty incumbent upon us to plea&s;e him, and yet that to remain impo&s;&s;ible for us, would be the mo&s;t me|lancholy Thought, and we &s;hould be the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of all creatures.</P>
<P>But &s;eeing the Lord is to be plea&s;ed by faith, and not to be plea&s;ed without it, we may hope and expect, con|&s;idering the attributes of his infinite goodne&s;s and mer|cy; that he hath, or will afford the means of faith; and it is expre&s;sly &s;aid, that faith is the gift of God.</P>
<P>As to the means of faith towards God, that he is, That is afforded to mankind in general; though there is an order of per&s;ons among them of whom the Lord doth not require faith, that is of infants, becau&s;e they are not capable of it in this &s;en&s;e; the&s;e, through his good|ne&s;s, he hath taken into the arms of his mercy, and his own protection, they are under his own care: But as to
<PB N="6" REF="046881_0005_1022439003886758">the re&s;t of mankind, who are arrived at a rational &s;tate, and capable of believing in God, he ju&s;tly expects that all &s;uch &s;hould believe in him.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="means">
<P>As the Almighty hath made us rational creatures, and be&s;towed upon us proper &s;en&s;es, whereby we may be|hold and perceive the vi&s;ible Creation of God, in that beautiful manner and order in which it appears.</P>
<P>This is the fir&s;t means of faith that God hath afford|ed unto mankind, and it is univer&s;al, and altogether &s;uf|ficient for the ends propo&s;ed by it; for every rational per&s;on, in every nation under Heaven, looking upon the Sun, Moon, and Stars, him&s;elf, and the re&s;t of the Creation of God around him, is compelled even by his own under&s;tanding, under a due con&s;ideration of the great and wi&s;e work of the Creation, to refer back from the creatures to the Creator, and determine po&s;itively and ab&s;olutely that he is, and is eternal and infinite in his Being, and that he hath in him&s;elf, eternally and un|alterably, all tho&s;e attributes commonly a&s;cribed unto him; that he is almighty in power, and all-wi&s;e; for nothing le&s;s than infinite almighty power and unlimited wi&s;dom, could produce the vi&s;ible creation, and &s;upport it in that order in which we &s;ee it. And the &s;en&s;es which God hath given us are &s;o well adapted to the cognizance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> their proper objects, that we are able thereby, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in their native and proper rectitude, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> infallibly, and that tho&s;e things are not ficti|tious, and that there is no deception or delu&s;ion in them, but that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and perceive them as they really are.</P>
<P>And to remain a little longer upon the &s;ame &s;ubject; the Apo&s;tle &s;aith, <Q>That who&s;oever cometh to God mu&s;t ar&s;t believe that he is,</Q> and that he is a rewarder of all tho&s;e who diligently &s;eek him; this is a very ra|tional po&s;ition; for he who doth not fir&s;t &s;incerely be|lieve the Being of God, will never &s;eek to know him, nor con&s;ider him as a rewarder of tho&s;e who &s;eek him.</P>
<P>He therefore who believes the Being of God mu&s;t &s;eek him, and that not coldly and indifferently, but with a
<PB N="7" REF="046881_0006_102243918C8E2838">real concern, and engagement of mind, and true de&s;ire to know him; for the knowledge of God is of the highe&s;t importance to us. For if we were able to know our own bodies, and every particular particle of them; and the cau&s;e and manner of the connection of them; and the manner of the connection of our bodies and minds, which are of Natures very different one from the other; or the gradations and medium in which they do meet; or the mode of the exi&s;tence of the mind, in a &s;tate of &s;eperation from the body; or if we could know the whole creation of God, and every particular part of it; and yet ignorant of the Lord him&s;elf, and deprived of the enjoyment of his divine pre&s;ence, that knowledge would not &s;atisfy the &s;oul; nothing can do that rightly but the knowledge of the Lord him&s;elf, in a &s;tate of eternal life with him, and in him.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t al&s;o &s;eek to know the Lord in his moral pro|perties and character: By his mercy, ju&s;tice, righteou&s;|ne&s;s, truth, goodne&s;s, patience, long-&s;uffering, and Ho|line&s;s; in all which if we are duly exerci&s;ed and ob&s;erv|ant, we &s;hall know the Lord God in his divine e&s;&s;ence, as he is love. And that exerci&s;e is known after this manner. As all have &s;inned and come &s;hort of the knowledge of the glory of God &s;ome one way and &s;ome another, but all again&s;t the one true and living God. And as we have &s;inned again&s;t him in various in&s;tances, doing that which is not ju&s;t before him, for which the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t, who is his witne&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s, hath judged and condemned us in our own under&s;tand|ings, whereby we know, in our own experience, the Lord is ju&s;t and righteous; likewi&s;e, in &s;ome in&s;tances in the cour&s;e of life we have been untrue, and partial in our own favour, and re&s;pecters of per&s;ons in unju&s;t &s;a|vour of others; for which we have &s;uffered condemna|tion, by the &s;pirit of truth in our own hearts, by which we know he is truth, &s;ince our untruth and fal&s;hood are reproved by him and judged. And &s;o far as we have &s;inned in any &s;ort, we have defiled our&s;elves there|by
<PB N="8" REF="046881_0007_10224393B9B5AE80">in mind and body, and offended again&s;t the holine&s;s of God; and yet, through his infinite un&s;peakable love and goodne&s;s he hath had mercy upon us, and exerci&s;ed patience and long-&s;uffering towards us, &s;hown us our &s;ins, by the light of his divine grace, and thereby taught us repentance unfeigned, and pardoned all our &s;ins, through Chri&s;t the beloved, whereby we are a&s;&s;ured for ever, that our God is infinitely perfect in mercy, ju&s;tice, truth, righteou&s;ne&s;s, goodne&s;s, long-&s;uffering, and ho|line&s;s; to the endle&s;s and never cea&s;ing prai&s;e of his eternal name: and that by the holy influence and enjoy|ment of his divine love, &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> abroad in our hears by his holy &s;pirit, under proper qualifications wrought thereby in us, WE KNOW THAT GOD IS LOVE.</P>
<P>Now, &s;eeing it &s;o plainly appears, by the works of the creation of God, to the under&s;tanding of every rati|onal being under Heaven, that God is, he is of con&s;e|quence the fir&s;t object of faith unto all &s;uch, in all nati|ons, and in all ages of the world.</P>

<P>And as to that part of the world who profe&s;s the name of God and Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Lord: As God the Father is the fir&s;t object of faith, by the works of the citation, to the mere national or rational man, ignorant of Chri&s;t, &s;o Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Son of God is the &s;econd object of &s;aith (together with the father, as they are one) to all them that believe, according to that &s;aying of Chri&s;t, "Ye believe in God believe al&s;o in me," that is, in him&s;elf; which is the &s;econd point pre&s;ented in my mind, &s;oon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> I &s;at down in this meeting among you, to wait up in God with you at this time.</P>

<P>And the &s;criptures of the new te&s;tament do likewi&s;e witne&s;s, that the very &s;ame per&s;on, attended with all tho&s;e various circum&s;tances, did come into the world, according to the very letter of tho&s;e predictions, and did the things predicted of him, in the &s;ight of the people, of the Jews in that age, (to whom he was &s;ent) and made his departure out of the world according to tho&s;e prophecies. All which, being public and notorious in the world, and written in the &s;ame generation, by com|petent
<PB N="10" REF="046881_0009_10225297A6929E58">witne&s;&s;es, both to matters of fact and doctrine, might ea&s;ily have been detected at the &s;ame time of fal&s;ehood, if they had not been true, &s;eeing the Lord Chri&s;t and his followers were &s;o much hated, oppo&s;ed, and envied, and e&s;pecially by the great, powerful, wi&s;e, and learned of the world, at that time.</P>
<P>What therefore can remain doubtful in any one born under the chri&s;tian name, in this part of the world, where we have the free u&s;e of the holy &s;criptures, in our own language, whereby the outward coming of Chri&s;t is &s;o plainly and fully proved, and e&s;tabli&s;hed as everla&s;ting irrefragable truth, and believed in a general way.</P>
<P>But if there be any objection in the minds of any con|cerning tho&s;e truths, which are &s;o plainly and rationally proved; it can ari&s;e from nothing el&s;e, but invincible, indocible ignorance, the blackne&s;s of darkne&s;s in irrati|onal minds: Or from &s;ome en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y through which the Lord was rejected in that day as an impo&s;tor and de|ceiver, by tho&s;e who&s;e temporal con&s;iderations and in|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> moved again&s;t Him, and tho&s;e who believed in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> received Him.</P>
<P>Or it mu&s;t be &s;ome &s;elect, &s;ecret, beloved, innate lu&s;t, oppo&s;ite to the nature and attributes of God, and even to human nature in its proper rectitude, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;uch &s;ouls, which p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">apts them to deny, at this day, the outward coming and miracles of Chri&s;t, and the great and nece&s;&s;ary ends of it unto all mankind. They will believe nothing as matters of fact, but what they them|&s;elves &s;ee and are witne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">es of, or what &s;uits with their weak under&s;tandings, or what they call their rea&s;on, which they have not yet defined to the re&s;t of mankind, what they mean thereby.</P>
<P>Would &s;uch men be &s;o &s;erved by the re&s;t of mankind? Would they not be believed when they relate matters of fact of which they are eye witne&s;&s;es, or what they have heard? Would any of them have another to &s;ay he is no witne&s;s of what he &s;aith, but a forger of fal&s;ehood, a con|triver of lies? I may rea&s;onably conclude they would
<PB N="11" REF="046881_0010_102252993A52F820">not, even in minute things; if then they them&s;elves ex|pect to be believed in what they &s;ay or witne&s;s, though in things of little con&s;equence, why &s;hould they pretend to &s;u&s;pect the veracity of others equally creditable, and much more &s;o than they? Surely the prophets of God, and apo&s;tles of Chri&s;t, and their te&s;timonies, with the concurrence of the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of men through ages, in the affirmative, ought, in common rea&s;on, to be pre|ferred and take place, again&s;t all the negative di&s;putati|ons and wranglings of a few bold and ignorant men, who neither know or believe any thing of the mo&s;t im|portant truths of the go&s;pel, or what them&s;elves affirm or deny concerning them: Would &s;uch think it rea&s;on|able, that a few men born blind, &s;hould oppo&s;e the re&s;t of mankind, and deny that any &s;ee becau&s;e they them|&s;elves are blind.</P>
<P>Common credit is to be given among mankind one to another, in things of the highe&s;t as well as the lowe&s;t con&s;equence; or el&s;e no innocent per&s;on could be clear|ed from the fal&s;ehood and oppre&s;&s;ion of the blacke&s;t and mo&s;t envious calumny. No wronged per&s;on righted: No bu&s;ine&s;s of any moment carried on: No criminal, how guilty &s;oever of the greate&s;t crimes laid to his charge, could be convicted, and brought to condign puni&s;hment, unle&s;s credit can be given to tho&s;e who are eye and ear witne&s;&s;es of matters of fact, which they have heard or &s;een.</P>
<P>The judges among the Jews, according to their judi|cial law and national order, could not judge of any crime, but by the te&s;timony of two or three witne&s;&s;es. And according to the con&s;titution of our own nation, no judge is witne&s;s of any matter of fact, or offence, by words, objected again&s;t any criminal, or offender; but mu&s;t judge according to the report of a jury, before whom matters and things have been proved, by witne&s;&s;|es furni&s;hed with proper credentials, and duly qualified. And then the judge applies the law to the offender, ac|cording
<PB N="12" REF="046881_0011_1022529B66B50EC0">to the nature of the offence, whether it be again&s;t common and civil right, or is criminal.</P>
<P>Seeing then there is, and mu&s;t be a general credit a|mong mankind one of another, with regard to the low affairs of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ite, much more is it nece&s;&s;ary, that due credit be given by the children of men with re&s;pect to tho&s;e great and important facts we read of in the &s;crip|tures of truth, concerning the &s;tupendous miracles wrought by Chri&s;t the Son of God, &s;o openly done in many in&s;tances, before &s;o many people, and in divers times and places, and authenticly reported unto us by proper witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>But to command all di&s;tempers to be gone: To mul|tiply natural food to &s;o great a degree, and that in two great in&s;tances, before &s;o great multitudes of people, who them&s;elves did partake thereof: to call the dead out of the grave, and the like, in the &s;ight of multitudes of people, things &s;o far tran&s;cending the under&s;tandings and knowledge of poor mortals, that they are apt to con|clude, there cannot be any &s;uch things; and being blinded by corrupt de&s;ires and appetites, &s;en&s;ual lu&s;ts and liberties of divers kinds, de&s;tructive of a right under|&s;tanding in the things of God, and ruinous to the &s;oul, they reject the truth.</P>
<P>This is the foundation of all infidelity, concerning the&s;e matters and things recorded in the holy &s;criptures, touching Chri&s;t the Lord, and &s;o rea&s;onably proved, ac|cording to that &s;aying of Chri&s;t to the like &s;ort in that day, "Verily, verily, I &s;ay unto thee, we &s;peak that we do know, and te&s;tify that we have &s;een; and ye re|ceive not our witne&s;s. If I have told you carthly things, and ye believe not, how &s;hall ye believe if I tell you of heavenly things? And no man hath a&s;cended up to Heaven, but he that came down from Heaven, even the Son of man which is in Heaven. And as Mo&s;es lifted up the &s;erpent in the wilderne&s;s, even &s;o mu&s;t the Son of man be li&s;ted up: That who|&s;oever believeth in him, &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have
<PB N="13" REF="046881_0012_1022529D0E6BC1D8">eternal life. For God &s;o loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that who&s;oever believeth in him, &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have everla&s;ting life, For God &s;ent not his Son into the world to condemn the world: but that the world through him might be &s;aved. He that believeth on him is not condemn|ed: But he that believeth not, is condemned already, becau&s;e he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkne&s;s rather than light, becau&s;e their deeds were evil. For every one that doth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lea&s;t his deeds &s;hould be reproved. But he that doth truth, cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manife&s;t, that they are wrought in God." John 3.11 to 21.</P>
<P>Again, how can&s;t thou comprehend by thy rea&s;on, or all the faculties of thy mind, that a pure, infinite, eter|nal Spirit as God is, free from all corporiety, could produce &s;uch a mighty &s;ub&s;tance as the dead and &s;olid earth, &s;o contrary in nature to a &s;piritual being. This may be above thy capacity to conceive, and yet if thou do&s;t not believe it, thou art &s;carce a rational creature, &s;ince (as &s;uch) thou art compelled to believe, that the earth did not produce it&s;elf, but that its being is owing to another and more excellent cau&s;e.</P>
<P>And &s;eeing the&s;e things are above the reach of thy under&s;tanding, how and after what manner it could be &s;o produced, yet, &s;ince thy &s;en&s;es declare and acknow|ledge its real being, that it is what it appears to be, and thou mu&s;t believe thy &s;en&s;es, again&s;t all the perver&s;e rea&s;onings thou or others can advance. Why then can&s;t thou not believe, that
