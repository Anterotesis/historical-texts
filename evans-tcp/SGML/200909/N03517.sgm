<P>WHEN the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t was fir&s;t publi&s;h'd in the World, it had innume|rable prejudices to conquer, and the &s;tronge&s;t oppo&s;ition to break through. A crucified Saviour was to the <HI>Jews</HI> a &s;tumbling, and to the <HI>Greeks</HI> fooli&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Peple of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were intoxicated with the dream of earthly grandeur, and vainly expected that the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah would a&s;&s;ume the en&s;igns of royalty and power, &s;ubdue all Nations by the force of his victorious Arms, and exalt them to the &s;upreme Government of the World. When therefore our ble&s;|&s;ed Saviour appeared in the humble circum&s;tances of poverty and di&s;grace, and they beheld (in&s;tead of a Conquering Prince) a man of &s;orrows and acquainted with grief; they de&s;pi&s;ed his per&s;on, rejected his Doc|trine, accu&s;ed him as an Impo&s;tor, and condemn'd him as a public Malefactor.</P>
<P>The People of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were intoxicated with the dream of earthly grandeur, and vainly expected that the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah would a&s;&s;ume the en&s;igns of royalty and power, &s;ubdue all Nations by the force of his victorious Arms, and exalt them to the &s;upreme Government of the World.

<P>The <HI>Gentiles</HI> were profe&s;s'd Admirers of Wi&s;dom, and di&s;ta&s;ted every thing that was not recommended with the beauties of Wit, and adorned with the flowers
<PB N="2" REF="004295_0005_10040F8F86ECF300">of Rhetoric: the Go&s;pel they therefore de&s;pis'd as a &s;imple and ill-contriv'd fable, de&s;titute of Art and Eloquence, and treated its profe&s;&s;ors with &s;corn and contempt. But notwith&s;tanding the unhappy preju|dices of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Doctors, and the in&s;olent Pride of the <HI>Gentile</HI> Philo&s;ophers, the Go&s;pel was attended with &s;urpri&s;ing &s;ucce&s;s, and Multitudes of all Orders and Degrees flock'd to the &s;tandard of Chri&s;t. This is plac'd by St. <HI>Paul,</HI> in our Text, among the My&s;teries of Godline&s;s. <HI>Great is the My&s;tery,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In &s;peaking unto the&s;e Words (by Divine A&s;&s;i&s;|tance) I &s;hall.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>Evidence the truth of the Fact,</HI> and &s;how that Chri&s;t was believed on in the World.</P>
<P>Secondly, I &s;hall con&s;ider this as a <HI>My&s;tery of God|line&s;s,</HI> beyond the power of &s;econd Cau&s;es, and to be a&s;cribed to the &s;upernatural influences of the Spirit of God.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. I am to <HI>evidence that Fact</HI> mention'd by the Apo&s;tle, and &s;hew that Chri&s;t was <HI>believed on in the World.</HI></P>
<P>No &s;ooner was the Go&s;pel publi&s;h'd by the fir&s;t Mini&s;ters of his Kingdom, but it was attended with a&s;toni&s;hing &s;ucce&s;s, and made a triumphant Progre&s;s through the Earth.</P>
<P>When the Great Author of our Religion a&s;cended into Heaven, the number of his Di&s;ciples was incon|&s;iderable: But no &s;ooner was the Spirit poured out upon the Apo&s;tles, but there was immediately a mighty Acce&s;&s;ion made to the Church, <HI>and three thou&s;and were added unto it in one Day</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts <HI>2.41.</HI></NOTE>. <HI>The Word of God increa&s;ed, and the Number of the Di&s;ciples multiplied greatly in Jeru&s;alem; and a great Company of the Prie&s;ts were
<PB N="3" REF="004295_0006_1004109D8440D630">obedient unto the Faith</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Acts</HI> 6.7</NOTE>. From thence with incredi|ble &s;wiftne&s;s it pa&s;s'd through all <HI>Judea, Samaria,</HI> &amp;c. and by degrees penetrated to the more di&s;tant parts of the World; &s;o that within thirty Years after the Death of Chri&s;t, and before the great and final de|&s;truction of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> it was not only diffu&s;ed through|out the whole <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, the Seat of Learning and Politene&s;s, but the dark corners of the Earth were inlightned with the Doctrine of Salvation, and the mo&s;t barbarous Nations had the Go&s;pel of the Kingdom convey'd unto them: and wherever it came, it flouri&s;h'd exceedingly; multitudes of all Ages and Sexes embrac'd the faith of Chri&s;t. So quick and &s;urpri&s;ing a progre&s;s it made in the World, that in a few Years we find the Chri&s;tian Apologi&s;ts boa&s;ting of their mighty numbers, and repre&s;enting to the pagan Emperors, <Q>that their Cities and Provinces, their Camps and their Courts, yea the Senate-hou&s;e and Palace, were filled with the de&s;pi&s;ed Sect of Chri&s;tians, and that it would be impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;troy them without exhau&s;ting the &s;trength of the Empire, and leaving all places in a &s;tate of di&s;mal &s;olitude and &s;ilence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tertull.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>And tho' at fir&s;t the Di&s;ciples of Je&s;us were de&s;ti|tute of wordly wi&s;dom and learning, without power and policy, of an humble and inferior character: yet in a few Years Men of uncommon Sagacity and Learning, of &s;uperiour Genius and Figure, laid a&s;ide their ancient prejudices and chearfully embrac'd a de|&s;pi&s;ed Go&s;pel. Thus the Word of God went on con|quering and to conquer, until at la&s;t the mighty Gene|rals of the Earth were &s;ubdued by its victorious power, and re&s;ign'd their lawrels at the foot of the Cro&s;s. The Sovereign Princes of the Roman Empire were per&s;waded to &s;ubmit to the Obedience of Faith, and zealou&s;ly to propagate that Faith which before
<PB N="4" REF="004295_0007_10040F9A1E2DC8C8">they had inhumanly per&s;ecuted. Thus was that Pro|phecy of I&s;aiah accompli&s;h'd, <HI>In the la&s;t days the moun|tain of the Lord's hou&s;e &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the top of the mountains, and be exalted above the hills, and all nations &s;hall flow unto it and be &s;aved</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai. <HI>2.2.</HI></NOTE>. But the &s;wift progre&s;s of the Go&s;pel being a Fact to fully known, and &s;o univer&s;ally acknowledged, I need not enlarge any further in the proof of it.</P>
<P>Secondly. I am to &s;hew, That this is <HI>a My&s;tery,</HI> beyond the power of &s;econd Cau&s;es, and to be a&s;cribed to the &s;upernatural influences of the Spirit of God. And this will appear, if we con&s;ider.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The a&s;toni&s;hing Change it produced in the Lives and Manners of its Profe&s;&s;ors.</HI> They were at once transformed into new Men and became obedient to the Faith, not in word but deed; they renounc'd their ancient Idolatries and became chearful Victims to the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t. When they chang'd their Profe&s;&s;ion they reform'd their manners, and from the depths of iniquity were recovered to the unfeigned practice of Piety. The proud Ma&s;ters of Philo&s;ophy for&s;ook their beloved Sentiments and &s;ubmitted to the di&s;pen&s;ation of Grace, the &s;en&s;ual and voluptuous were per&s;waded to mortify the Fle&s;h, and renounc'd the forbidden Plea&s;ures of Sin, the ambitious de&s;pi&s;ed their earthly honours, and receiv'd the Crown of Mar|tyrdom as their highe&s;t Glory, the covetous Mi&s;er became beneficent and charitable, and con&s;ecrated his Wealth to the &s;ervice of the Saints; Per&s;ecutors were di&s;arm'd of their fury and grew ambitious of appear|ing among the Martyrs of Je&s;us; the fierce&s;t Natures were &s;ubdued into Meekne&s;s, and in&s;ulting tyrants be|came patrons of oppre&s;s'd Innocene and Vertue.</P>
<P>This mighty change was happily exemplified in the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Converts, who were practiced in the
<PB N="5" REF="004295_0008_10040FA8E7BFB860">vile&s;t iniquities, but after their receiving the Go&s;pel were eminent for their temperance and &s;obriety, <HI>they were wa&s;hed, &s;anctified, and ju&s;tified in the Name of the Lord Je&s;us and by the Spirit of our God</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.10, 11.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Yea &s;o exemplary were the lives of Chri&s;tians in the&s;e fir&s;t and pure&s;t Ages of the Church that their very enemies repre&s;ent them as <Q>a devout, innocent and charitable &s;ort of men,</Q> and the ancient defen|ders of the faith challenge their adver&s;aries to produce one of their Number <Q>that was condemn'd as a thief or a murderer, or was guilty of any gro&s;s enormities for which the pagan world was &s;o infamous.</Q> Now certainly nothing but a divine power could produce &s;uch a wonderful Change in the lives and manners of men; it is only the almighty Spirit of grace, that can &s;ubdue the perver&s;ne&s;s of human Nature, re&s;train the tumultuous pa&s;&s;ions of mankind, and transform Mon|&s;ters of Vice and Impiety into patterns of Sobriety and Vertue.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let us con&s;ider <HI>the Meanne&s;s and Simplicity of the In&s;truments, that were employed in this Ble&s;&s;ed Work.</HI> A Stranger to the &s;acred Hi&s;tory will perhaps imagine that the Go&s;pel was propagated at fir&s;t by Men of &s;uperior Genius, intimately acquainted with the &s;ecrets of human Learning, well vers'd in the Art of di&s;|puting, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Charms of Per&s;wa&s;ion and Eloquence; and had this been the ca&s;e, the &s;ucce&s;s of the Go&s;pel had not been &s;o wonderful, nor the divine power &s;o clearly di&s;play'd: therefore <HI>God cho&s;e the fooli&s;h things of the world to confound the wi&s;e, the weak things of the world to confound the mighty, that no fle&s;h &s;hould glory in his pre&s;ence</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.27, 29.</NOTE>. The Apo&s;tles were Men of contemptible figure, inferior extract, and of plain Un|der&s;tanding; they were not poli&s;h'd by Education, nor improv'd by &s;tudy, but brought up to the meane&s;t employments; they had neither Art to in&s;inuate them|&s;elves
<PB N="6" REF="004295_0009_100410A374052B50">into the affections of their hearers, nor power to compel them to embrace their doctrines; they were not &s;upported by authority, nor clothed with pomp and &s;plendor to awe the minds of men into &s;ubjection and reverence; but they appear'd with the utmo&s;t plainne&s;s and &s;implicity, and addre&s;s'd their hearers with humility and meekne&s;s. The&s;e were the fir&s;t Heralds of the Everla&s;ting Go&s;pel, and by the&s;e (in them&s;elves contemptible In&s;truments) it pleas'd God to humble the Pride of man, and &s;ubdue the world to the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t. This then declares the divine power that attended the Publication of the Go&s;pel: <HI>we have this trea&s;ure in earthen Ve&s;&s;els, that the excellen|cy of the Power may be of God and not of us</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.7.</NOTE>. And this divine Power will further appear, if we con|&s;ider</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The manner in which the Go&s;pel was propagated in the world.</HI> The In&s;truments employed were not only mean and contemptible, but the method they took to accompli&s;h their de&s;ign was contrary to carnal Po|licy, and mo&s;t unlikely to prevail. Impo&s;tors have always endeavoured to propagate their doctrines by force, or in&s;inuate them into the minds of men by policy and contrivance.</P>
<P>Thus the Prophet of Arabia introduc'd his religion by the Sword, and by his victorious Arms oblig'd the Nations to receive the Alcoran. The Papal Empire was at fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h'd by force, and has been &s;up|ported ever &s;ince by continual Stratagem.</P>
<P>But the Apo&s;tles of Chri&s;t abhor'd all methods of deceit, nor did they propagate their doctrines by force and &s;word; they were not attended with conquering Armies to prepare the way for their reception, nor did they make u&s;e of torture and violence to &s;upport and enlarge their conque&s;ts. <HI>The Weapons of their War|fare were not carnal but &s;piritual:</HI> They addre&s;t their
<PB N="7" REF="004295_0010_10040F9D2E704E40">nearears <HI>not with the inticing words of man's wi&s;dom</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.4.</NOTE>, with &s;tudied Ornaments of Speech or engaging me|thods of per&s;wa&s;ion, but in the mo&s;t plain and artle&s;s manner declared unto them the doctrine and mira|cles, the death and re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t; they pro|claimed him whom the Jews had &s;lew and hanged upon a tree, the Saviour of the World, and the Prince of the Kings of the Earth. They promi&s;ed an Im|mortality of Happine&s;s and Glory to tho&s;e that believ'd in his Name and obey'd his Commandments: but on the contrary they threatned de&s;truction and mi&s;ery to &s;uch as &s;hould impenitently de&s;pi&s;e and reject him. And yet by the&s;e contemptible methods, in the mid&s;t of innumerable difficulties, they gain'd pro&s;elytes to the faith and baffled the Wi&s;dom and Eloquence, the power and policy of the world: this certainly exceeds the power of man and evidences that the almighty in|fluences of the Spirit attended them.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The Doctrines inculcated in the Go&s;pel make it &s;till more my&s;terious,</HI> that Chri&s;t &s;hould be believed on in the world. Had the doctrine of Chri&s;t been &s;uited to the Pride of human Nature and calculated to flatter Men in their Vices and Plea&s;ures, we might ju&s;tly have expected that it would be &s;uddenly and univer|&s;ally embrac'd: for men are fond of gratifying their &s;en&s;ual inclinations, they ea&s;ily receive a doctrine which indulges their Pride and Pa&s;&s;ions, and affords them an unlimited enjoyment of their darling Plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>By this means the religion of Mahomet, became pa|latable to a vicious World, and quickly over-&s;pread the Nations of the Ea&s;t; for it encouraged an un|bounded indulgence of men's appetites and lu&s;ts upon Earth, and promi&s;ed an eternal paradi&s;e of bruti&s;h and &s;en&s;ual enjoyments in a future world.&mdash;But the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t had nothing of this nature to recom|mend it to the public reception; the doctrines it taught
<PB N="8" REF="004295_0011_100410AF5ADE8658">were &s;ublime and my&s;terious, contrary to the Pride and pa&s;&s;ions of men; the duties it inculcated were har&s;h and ungrateful, again&s;t the grain of our corrupt and defiled Natures; it obliged its profe&s;&s;ors <HI>to deny all ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts, to live &s;oberly and righte|ou&s;ly and godly in this pre&s;ent world</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tit.</HI> 2.12.</NOTE>. It required them to renounce their darling iniquities and part with their mo&s;t de&s;irable enjoyments when they became in|con&s;i&s;tent with a good Con&s;cience. The&s;e were hard &s;ayings indeed and difficult to be practi&s;ed by a dege|nerate Age: and yet notwith&s;tanding the&s;e difficulties and di&s;advantages it prevailed exceedingly in the World, and triumph'd over the vices and follies of men. And this is &s;till more wonderful, if we con|&s;ider</P>
<P N="5"><HI>5. The unhappy Prejudices, that prevailed again&s;t the Go&s;pel-di&s;pen&s;ation.</HI> Prejudice is always an enemy to truth, and fixes the mind in an inveterate oppo&s;ition again&s;t it, and no prejudice is &s;o &s;trong as that which is received from the birth and founded in Educa|tion, e&s;pecially when it is &s;trengthned by Authority and recommended by the venerable claim of Anti|quity. It is next to impo&s;&s;ible to era&s;e the early im|pre&s;&s;ions that men receive in their tender Age, and per&s;wade them to renounce that Religion, which from their infancy they have been taught to revere and obey. And this was a mighty difficulty which the Go&s;pel had to encounter at its fir&s;t appearance. Both Jews and Gentiles were filled with the &s;tronge&s;t prejudices again&s;t it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jews,</HI> the peculiar People of God, had the highe&s;t reverence for the Law o Mo&s;es, which was unque&s;tionably of divine Authority, and deliver'd unto them from Heaven, with the utmo&s;t pomp and &s;o|lemnity. They had al&s;o a venerable regard for the traditions of the Elders which they believed to be
<PB N="9" REF="004295_0012_100410B3F85A3D30">&s;acred and binding upon the Con&s;cience. But above all their minds were filled with a flattering expecta|tion of earthly dignities, and delighted with a ground|le&s;s hope that their Me&s;&s;iah would be a temporal Prince and appear with a pro&s;perous and conquering Army; this filled them with an invincible aver&s;ion to our humble Redeemer, and they de&s;pi&s;ed the afflicted State in which he appear'd.</P>
<P>And the prejudices of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> were as &s;trong as tho&s;e of the <HI>Jews;</HI> they were addicted to the mo&s;t execrable Idolatries and &s;unk into the lowe&s;t State of Ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition; the Prince of darkne&s;s reign'd in their Hearts without controul, and for many Ages maintain'd an undi&s;turb'd dominion over them; the wor&s;hip of their Idols was e&s;tabli&s;h'd by immemo|rial pre&s;cription, and the method of it was &s;tately and magnificent, their Prie&s;ts were engaged by Intere&s;t to maintain their ancient Cu&s;toms, and per&s;waded the multitude that their co&s;tly Sacrifices and &s;uper&s;titious modes of wor&s;hip appeas'd the Anger of the Gods and procur'd continual peace and pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>The Philo&s;ophers were puffed up with a vain con|ceit of their knowledge, and were too proud to &s;ub|mit to the humbling di&s;coveries of the Go&s;pel, they de&s;pi&s;ed the plainne&s;s and &s;implicity of its teachers, and di&s;ta&s;ted the &s;trictne&s;s and purity of its precepts. The Doctrine of the Cro&s;s they e&s;teem'd a ridiculous Story, and the Re&s;urrection from the dead the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ab&s;urdity; thus St. Paul was &s;tiled a babbler by the Wits of Athens, <HI>and look'd upon as a &s;etter forth of &s;trange Gods, becau&s;e he preach'd unto them Je&s;us and the Re&s;urrection</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Acts</HI> 17.18.</NOTE>: and yet the Doctrine of Chri&s;t bore up again&s;t all oppo&s;ition, and triumphantly prevailed in &s;pight of all partiality and prejudice.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>The&s;e prejudices were increa&s;ed by the bitter per|&s;ecutions to which Chri&s;tianity was expo&s;ed.</HI> The Pri|mitive
<PB N="10" REF="004295_0013_100410B74F34CE98">believers had not only the Corruptions of humane Nature to conquer, the propo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of Edu|cation to &s;urmount, but the Rage and Malice of Earth and Hell to contend with. The Dominion of Satan was di&s;turb'd by the preaching of the Go&s;pel, and the prince of darkne&s;s was unwilling to lo&s;e &s;o many &s;ubjects of his Empire, he therefore engag'd the Pow|ers of the World &s;trongly to combine again&s;t it. <HI>The Kings of the Earth and the Rulers took coun&s;el together again&s;t the Lord and again&s;t his anointed</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>P&s;al.</HI> 2, 2.</NOTE>. The High Prie&s;ts and Governors among the Jews u&s;ed their utmo&s;t endeavours to &s;tifle Chri&s;tianity in the birth, and &s;uppre&s;s it in its infancy. And when it began to increa&s;e in the World, the whole face of the Roman Empire the Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Earth was engag'd again&s;t it, and mighty per&s;ecutions were continually rais'd to extirpate and de&s;troy it.</P>
<P>How many for&s;ook their mo&s;t valuable enjoyments and were bani&s;h'd into the mo&s;t de&s;olate Corners of the Earth for the te&s;timony of Je&s;us? how many &s;ub|mitted to the mo&s;t barbarous Cruelties rather than make &s;hipwreck of faith and a good Con&s;cience, and &s;uffer'd the mo&s;t affrighting Deaths for the honour of our great Redeemer. They were expos'd to hunger, thir&s;t and nakedne&s;s, they were de&s;troy'd by fire and &s;word, they were condemned to be devoured by Bea&s;ts and forc'd to expire in the mid&s;t of torments. In fine, the King of terrors was pre&s;ented to their view in its mo&s;t formidable appearance, to deter them from the profe&s;&s;ion of the Go&s;pel, or per&s;wade them to re|nounce and for&s;ake it.</P>
<P>And yet the&s;e ancient Heroes of the Chri&s;tian Church, this noble Army of Martyrs, per&s;i&s;ted in their Faith in the mid&s;t of their bittere&s;t &s;ufferings, they took joyfully the &s;poiling of their goods, and patiently &s;ubmitted to the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite mi&s;eries, they
<PB N="11" REF="004295_0014_100410C2B6829AE8">gloried in the Cro&s;s in the pre&s;ence of their enraged per&s;ecutors, and rejoiced that they were counted wor|thy to &s;uffer for the Name of Chri&s;t; they encountred Death not only with patience and re&s;ignation, but embrac'd it with extacy and triumph; they hugg'd their Chains as the trophies of their honour, and re|ceiv'd their Executioners as the Me&s;&s;engers of Heaven; to convey them to the happy man&s;ions of Paradi&s;e. They enter'd into the fire with Joy, and breath'd out their Souls in chearful Hallelujahs.</P>
<P>Nor was this peculiar to men of undaunted Cou|rage and manly Re&s;olution, but the Number of Con|fe&s;&s;ors was va&s;t, and con&s;i&s;ted of Per&s;ons of all Ages and Sexes, of all Orders and Conditions. The hoary Heads de&s;pis'd the Weakne&s;s of their declining Years, and joyfully devoted the remainder of their days to the defence of the truth. Blooming Youths forgot the tenderne&s;s of their Con&s;titutions, and with undaunted Courage entered the fiery trial, and even delicate Virgins renounc'd the &s;oftne&s;s of their Sex, and de|&s;pi&s;ed Death, tho' attended with the mo&s;t gha&s;tly terrors.</P>
<P>Now what but a divine Power could pre&s;erve the Church in the mid&s;t of the fiery furnace? Had this Work or Coun&s;el been of men, it mu&s;t certainly have been overthrown, when all the Powers of Earth were united to oppo&s;e it: but under all the di&s;couragements that the Policy of men could invent, or the Malice of tyrants inflict, the Go&s;pel flouri&s;h'd, mighty ad|ditions were made to the Church, all attempts to &s;up|pre&s;s it prov'd &s;ucce&s;sful methods to advance its Glory. The Contradiction of Sinners redounded to the Credit of its Di&s;ciples. The Blood of the Martyrs was the &s;eed of the Church, and like the &s;howers of Heaven upon the thir&s;ty Earth, made it more fruitful and flouri&s;hing. This mu&s;t be acknowledged the work of the Lord, and it &s;hould be marvellous in our Eves. It certainly de&s;erves a place among the My&s;te|ries

<P N="1">1. <HI>Let us all be per&s;waded to believe the Truth and Divinity of the Go&s;pel, which was &s;o eminently confirm'd from Heaven, and &s;o miraculou&s;ly prevailed in the world.</HI> The Great Author of our Religion evidenc'd his Mi&s;&s;ion by the mo&s;t unque&s;tionable Authority; the Father te&s;tified his approbation from Heaven, and in a Voice of thunder, declar'd him his beloved Son in whom he was well plea&s;ed.&mdash; The Miracles which he wrought in the pre&s;ence of Multitudes declar'd him to be the Son of God, and the Saviour of the World.&mdash; The wonderful de&s;cent of the holy Gho&s;t upon the Apo&s;tles, and the a&s;toni&s;hing Gift of tongues with which they were at once in&s;pired, was a vi&s;ible confir|mation of his Doctrine, and a &s;tanding te&s;timony that the Go&s;pel was not a cunningly devi&s;ed fable, but of divine and heavenly extract.</P>
<P>But were all the&s;e forgotten, the incredible &s;ucce&s;s that attended it at its fir&s;t promulgation again&s;t all hu|mane probabilities, would be a &s;ufficient demon&s;tra|tion that it was of God and not of Man.&mdash;Is it po&s;&s;ible to conceive, &s;o unacceptable a Scheme could be im|po&s;ed upon the world by men de&s;titute of Education and Learning, without art and addre&s;s; and univer|&s;ally prevail in &s;pight of prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and prejudice, in oppo&s;ition to perpetual force and violence, without any advantages to recommend it, but the promi&s;e of an un&s;een and future Reward?

This mu&s;t be own'd to have been the Work of God, and a remarkable evidence of the divine Authority of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>How va&s;t is the Guilt, how awful the danger of tho&s;e, who reject the Doctrine of Chri&s;t!</HI> The Jews per|&s;ecuted Chri&s;t in his State of &s;uffering and weakne&s;s, and the Gentiles oppos'd the Progre&s;s of the Go&s;pel through the &s;trength and prejudice of Education; but the Infidels of the pre&s;ent Age in&s;ult him upon his Throne, and ca&s;t contempt upon him, to whom all power in Heaven and Earth is committed; and that after the cleare&s;t di&s;coveries of his divine Authority, and the fulle&s;t evidence of the truth of his Mi&s;&s;ion. Their Sin therefore is of a deeper Dye than the Ini|quities of Sodom and Gomorrah, and their puni&s;h|ment will be more &s;evere than the de&s;truction of ignorant Heathens. Had the Princes of this World been acquainted with the dignity of his Per&s;on and the excellence of his Doctrine, they would not have cru|cified the Lord of Glory; this therefore was an abate|ment of their Guilt, and render'd them capable of Pardon: but now the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s hath ap|pear'd in &s;uch vi&s;ible Glory, cha&s;ed away the darkne&s;s of Heatheni&s;m, and e&s;tabli&s;h'd his Kingdom upon the Ruins of Super&s;tition and Idolatry, it is unaccountable Ob&s;tinacy not to acknowledge his Authority, and &s;ub|mit to his ju&s;t and righteous Government.

Alas! in this degenerate Age, Religion is wounded in the Hou&s;e of its Friends, the Profe&s;&s;ors of the Go&s;pel are oftentimes Enemies to the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, and the venerable Name by which we are called, is in|&s;ulted and bla&s;phemed by rea&s;on of the &s;candalous mi&s;carriages of tho&s;e who enroll their Names among the number of his followers: this is indeed a melan|choly reflection, and &s;hould in&s;pire us with a pious Indignation again&s;t the Vices and Impieties of the Age, and inkindle in our Brea&s;ts a fervent Zeal to advance the honour of that holy Religion we pro|&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Let us &s;incerely endeavour after a &s;aving acquain|tance with this My&s;tery of Godline&s;s.</HI> Our ble&s;&s;ed Sa|viour is propos'd unto us in the Go&s;pel as the proper Object of our Faith, and recommended to our E&s;teem

<P>IT is the di&s;tingui&s;hing privilege of Man, the lord of this lower world, that he was made a rea&s;on|able and accountable creature, and de&s;ign'd for a future State of immortality; the noble powers with which he is endowed, and the va&s;t improvements he is capable of, were not intended to be confined to this dark and imperfect Scene of action: Death that de&s;troys our earthly frame, and puts an End to our worldly bu&s;ine&s;s and enjoyments, does not put a final period to our being, but tran&s;lates us into a future &s;tate: when we pa&s;s off the &s;tage of time, we enter upon an unalterable eternity; for <HI>after death comes the Judgment.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Heb.</HI> 9.27.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This is an important Article of the chri&s;tian faith, frequently inculcated in the &s;acred Oracles, and almo&s;t univer&s;ally received in the world. It is mentioned in our text as one of the <HI>fir&s;t principles</HI> of the doctrine of Chri&s;t, and the <HI>foundation</HI> of practical Religion. It is therefore of the highe&s;t con&s;equence, to fix in our
<PB N="17" REF="004295_0020_100410DAD717AAB8">minds an un&s;haken per&s;wa&s;ion of this awful truth, that we may feel its happy influence, and be excited to prepare for the coming of our Lord. To this end it is my de&s;ign from the words now read,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, To con&s;ider the <HI>Evidences</HI> of a future Judg|ment.</P>
<P>Secondly, To make &s;ome <HI>Improvement</HI> of this Im|portant Doctrine.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. I am to con&s;ider the <HI>Evidences of a future Judgment.</HI> And here I &s;hall ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The voice of con&s;cience bears te&s;timony unto it.</HI> There is implanted in the brea&s;t of every man a con|&s;cience, on which is engraven with a pen of iron and the point of a diamond, the nece&s;&s;ary and immutable di&s;tinction between virtue and vice, between good and evil:&mdash; hence ari&s;es that happy &s;erenity of mind, that &s;ecret joy and &s;atisfaction that attends the practice of virtue, and tho&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;ing fears and gloomy &s;u&s;|picions, which are the melancholy companions of vice and impiety: So that the good man has an inward &s;upport and comfort, even when he meets with nothing but frowns and di&s;couragements from without, and is often filled with joyful expectations of a reward in the mid&s;t of worldly darkne&s;s and difficulty; on the other hand the wicked are haunted with perpetual terrors in the mo&s;t pro&s;perous circum&s;tances of life, and terrified with the apprehen&s;ions of future vengeance, tho' their crimes are concealed from the world, and committed in the darke&s;t privacy. At the approach of death, when all hopes and fears are at end with re&s;pect to this life, then the&s;e apprehen&s;ions are the mo&s;t lively and vigorous: in that melancholy hour the wicked are in a more e&s;pecial manner &s;tung with remor&s;e for their iniquities,&mdash; reflect with horror upon their pa&s;t lives, and tremble at the apprehen&s;ion of impending
<PB N="18" REF="004295_0021_100410DC62E41D18">vengeance; whereas the righteous are oftentimes &s;up|ported with the mo&s;t &s;prightly hopes, and amid&s;t the agonies and convul&s;ions of nature, are revived with the joyful pro&s;pect of immortality and glory.</P>
<P>Nor are the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions of futurity peculiar to men of narrow minds, of gloomy and &s;u&s;picious tem|pers, but men of all orders and degrees, of all ages and conditions have felt the force of them. Con&s;cience exerci&s;es its power without re&s;pect of per&s;ons, the greate&s;t monarchs are equally liable to its reproaches with the meane&s;t of their &s;ubjects; &mdash; in&s;ulting tyrants have trembled at the remembrance of their guilt, tho' plac'd above the reach of any human tribunal, and &s;urrounded with a &s;ervile train of flatterers and depen|dants. Con&s;cience is neither aw'd by greatne&s;s, nor brib'd by riches, nor charm'd into &s;ilence by gaieties and plea&s;ure: it breaks through, the &s;tronge&s;t guards, in&s;inuates into the palaces of the mighty, and is not afraid to &s;ay <HI>to a King, thou art wicked, and to Princes, Ye are ungodly.</HI> It &s;ets before them a black catalogue of their crimes, cites them before the inlightned tri|bunal of heaven, and fills them with fearful expecta|tions of a judgment to come.</P>
<P>The Sinner may indeed filence the voice of con&s;ci|ence for a time, and &s;uppre&s;s the&s;e unea&s;y impre&s;&s;ions while he is amu&s;ed with company and ingaged in bu|&s;ine&s;s or diver&s;ion, yet they are hardly ever quite ef|fac'd and obliterated; but when the wicked are retir'd from the vanities of the world, when any accident intervenes, that puts a &s;top to the gaiety of their thoughts, and di&s;po&s;es them to &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and reflec|tion, the mind awakes out of its &s;tupidity, and is hara&s;&s;ed with continual Images of horror. Now to what &s;hall we a&s;cribe the&s;e awful apprehen&s;ions of futurity, that &s;o univer&s;ally po&s;&s;e&s;s the brea&s;ts of men, and attend us to the la&s;t period of Life? Mu&s;t we not &s;uppo&s;e that they are impre&s;&s;ions &s;tampt upon our nature by the wi&s;e Author of our beings, and de|&s;ign'd
<PB N="19" REF="004295_0022_10040FC631ADE928">to warn us of a future judgment? and con&s;e|quently that the&s;e Joys of the righteous are the dawn|ings of immortality and the earne&s;t of eternal happi|ne&s;s, and that the terrors of the wicked are the begin|ning of Sorrows, and the fir&s;t fruits of endle&s;s and intolerable mi&s;ery.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Perfections of God, the &s;upreme Governor of the world, &s;eem to require a future judgment.</HI> The fir&s;t notion we entertain of God is, that he is infinitely perfect in all his attributes; and whatever implies the lea&s;t imperfection, &s;trikes at the very exi&s;tence of the Deity, and bani&s;hes him out of the world.</P>
<P>The admirable beauty that appears on the face of Nature, the wife di&s;po&s;ition of its various parts, and their mutual &s;ub&s;erviency to the good of the whole, are &s;tanding evidences that this world was made at fir&s;t by a wi&s;e and powerful Being, and is continually pre&s;erved and governed by his gracious providence: Nor can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that infinite Wi&s;dom &s;hould be employ'd in ordering the inferior creation with &s;uch &s;urpri&s;ing harmony and exactne&s;s, and ca&s;t off the care of man, his favourite creature, and the mo&s;t noble part of his workman&s;hip.</P>
<P>Now if God is &s;o infinitely perfect in him&s;elf, and human affairs are &s;ubject to his wi&s;e and univer&s;al pro|vidence, we may ju&s;tly conclude, that as he loves righteou&s;ne&s;s and hateth iniquity, &s;o he will encourage the one and di&s;countenance the other, in a way agrea|ble to the undoubted perfections of his nature, and con&s;equently will make a vi&s;ible di&s;tinction between the generation of his faithful Servants, and the com|pany of his implacable enemies.&mdash;The Purity of the divine Nature, and the ju&s;tice of his Government a&s;&s;ures us, that he will not condemn the innocent, nor always &s;uffer the guilty to e&s;cape with impunity; this would be an unan&s;werable reflection upon an earthly Prince, and &s;oon bring his Government into univer&s;al confu&s;ion and contempt, and therefore mu&s;t not be
<PB N="20" REF="004295_0023_100410E9B86B9698">attributed to the &s;upreme Governour of the world, who is wi&s;er than the Kings of the earth.&mdash;The only que&s;tion then is, Whether in the pre&s;ent di&s;pen&s;ations of providence, there is this vi&s;ible difference made between the righteous and the wicked, between him that &s;erves God, and him that &s;erveth him not?&mdash;Is virtue always rewarded in this world, and vice re|markably puni&s;h'd?&mdash;This cannot be pretended, the contrary is evident to the mo&s;t carele&s;s ob&s;erver.</P>
<P>We daily behold a great deal of darkne&s;s and diffi|culty appearing upon the face of providence, and good and evil &s;eem to be indifferently di&s;pen&s;ed to the righ|teons and to the wicked. <HI>There is one event to the ju&s;t and to the unju&s;t, to him that &s;weareth, and to him that feareth an oath</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Eccl.</HI> 9.2.</NOTE>, without any frequent interpo&s;ition to vindicate the cau&s;e of innocence, and puni&s;h the vio|lence of the oppre&s;&s;or. The vertuous man is not &s;ecured from the common trials and afflictions of life, but oftentimes &s;tands peculiarly expo&s;ed to the bla&s;ts of adver&s;ity; his &s;trength and beauty is con&s;umed by wa&s;ting di&s;ea&s;es, his e&s;tate devoured by oppre&s;&s;ion and inju&s;tice, and his reputation &s;ullied by the breath of envy and malice.&mdash;While the wicked are triumphing in pro&s;perity,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>P&s;al.</HI> 73.5.</NOTE> <HI>Neither are they plagued like other men; they live, they become old, they are mighty in power, their &s;eed is e&s;tabli&s;h'd in their &s;ight, and their offspring before their eyes; their hou&s;es are &s;afe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them; they &s;pend their days in wealth, and in a moment</HI> (without any remarkable judgment) <HI>they go down to the grave</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Job,</HI> 21.7.</NOTE> &mdash;<HI>Thus we &s;ee a ju&s;t man to whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked, and a wicked man to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous</HI><NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot"><HI>Eccl.</HI> 8.14.</NOTE>:&mdash; It is no uncommon &s;ight, to behold men of di&s;tingui&s;h'd vice advanc'd to places of dignity and power, and enjoy the large&s;t &s;hare of wealth and e&s;teem, &mdash;while men

Per&s;ecuted innocence &s;tands trembling at the barr, while wickedne&s;s is exalted to the throne. The mo&s;t eminent Saints are clothed in rags, and de&s;titute of the conveniencies of Life, while the bruti&s;h epicure is clothed in purple and &s;carlet, and fares &s;umptuou&s;ly every day.&mdash;Nay, the wicked often attain to their greatne&s;s and power, by the mo&s;t unju&s;t and di&s;grace|ful methods; they a&s;cend to the pinacle of honour upon the ruins of their oppre&s;&s;ed neighbours; when at the &s;ame time the righteous, for their &s;teady adherence to the Laws of God, and zeal and fidelity in his &s;er|vice, are per&s;ecuted in their names, robb'd of their e&s;tates, and expo&s;ed to the lo&s;s of all the valuable en|joyments of life.&mdash;Thus the illu&s;trious Saints of old, <HI>of whom the earth was not worthy,</HI> were per&s;ecuted and abu&s;ed, <HI>they wandered about in &s;heep-&s;kins and goat-&s;kins,</HI> they inhabited the <HI>dens and caverns of the earth, they were de&s;titute, afflicted and tormented</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Heb.</HI> 11.37, 38.</NOTE>, while their guilty per&s;ecutors were honoured with the public e&s;teem, and enjoy'd all the felicities that earth could afford them.&mdash;Now how &s;hall we reconcile the&s;e events, with the wi&s;dom and ju&s;tice of divine Provi|dence, if we confine our thoughts to the pre&s;ent world, and do not look forward to a future judgment?&mdash; Will the &s;overeign Ruler of the univer&s;e make no ju&s;t di&s;tinction between tho&s;e who in&s;olently defy his power and prophanely de&s;pi&s;e his authority, and tho&s;e who &s;tedfa&s;tly obey his laws, and &s;acrifice their deare&s;t enjoyments in obedience to his commands?&mdash; Shall per&s;ecuted vertue be always hi&s;s'd off the &s;tage with di&s;grace, and be buried in eternal &s;ilence and oblivion?&mdash;Shall the triumphing of the wicked en|dure for ever, and the ungodly always po&s;&s;e&s;s the fruits of their pro&s;perous villanies?&mdash;Where would

<P>Tho' for a time he may &s;eem to wink at the &s;ins of men, and &s;uffer them to pa&s;s unpuni&s;h'd: Tho' he may permit his &s;ervants to be abu&s;ed and in&s;ulted, for the trial of their faith, and the brightning of their vertues: yet <HI>the triumphing of the wicked is but &s;hort, and the joy of the hypocrite is but for a moment.</HI> The God of ju&s;tice will &s;hortly appear in the defence of his per&s;ecuted children, and evidence to the whole in|telligent world, that he loveth righteou&s;ne&s;s and hateth iniquity. Tho' clouds and darkne&s;s at pre&s;ent encom|pa&s;s the throne of his Ju&s;tice, and our &s;hallow capa|cities are not able to &s;earch into the rea&s;ons of his conduct; yet we may be a&s;&s;ured, that he will &s;hortly vindicate the honour of his de&s;pi&s;ed laws, and di&s;play the wi&s;dom and equity of his Government. <HI>He will bring forth his righteou&s;ne&s;s as the light, and his judg|ment as the noon-day.</HI> Every eye &s;hall &s;ee, and every tongue &s;hall confe&s;s, <HI>that verily there is a reward for the righteous, there is a God that judgeth in the earth.</HI> I proceed to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The &s;acred Scriptures expre&s;sly reveal a future Judgment.</HI> The light of nature makes it probable, that God who made the world by his power, and
<PB N="23" REF="004295_0026_100410F724554118">governs it by his providence, will al&s;o judge it here|after; but the light of the Go&s;pel gives us the mo&s;t convincing evidence of this important truth, and a&s;&s;ures us, that the day is appointed, and the time is prefix'd in the unalterable decrees of heaven. In all ages of the Church mankind have been warned of this awful day. Before the de&s;truction of the earth by the flood, <HI>Enoch the &s;eventh from Adam prophecied</HI> of a Judgment to come, <HI>&s;aying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thou&s;and of his Saints to execute judgment upon all</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jude</HI> 14, 15.</NOTE>.

<P>Thus we have not only the te&s;timony of con&s;cience, the infinite perfections of God, and the goodne&s;s and
<PB N="24" REF="004295_0027_10040FD307D6D9E8">ju&s;tice of his Government, to a&s;&s;ure us of this great truth; but we have the expre&s;s declarations of his will, which gives us the highe&s;t and mo&s;t &s;atisfactory evi|dence, and by which all the other arguments that &s;up|port it are &s;trengthned and confirm'd; &s;o that we are as certain that there will be a future judgment, as if we &s;aw the heavens opening, and the almighty Judge de&s;cending, the tribunal erected, and the dead &s;mall and great &s;tanding before it. I pa&s;s therefore,</P>
<P>Secondly, To make &s;ome <HI>Improvement</HI> of this aw|ful doctrine. And here,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>This manife&s;ts the ju&s;tice of divine Providence, and an&s;wers the objections that are &s;o frequently brought again&s;t it.</HI> When we &s;ee the tabernacles of robbers pro&s;per, and the prophane and ungodly flouri&s;h in ea&s;e and pro&s;perity; when the vile&s;t men are exalted to the height of honour, and po&s;&s;e&s;s the large&s;t afflu|ence of worldly enjoyments, while the children of God are bow'd down with an heavy weight of cares, and loaded with contempt and di&s;grace:&mdash; When im|penitent tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors depart out of the world in peace, and <HI>the wicked have no bands in their death;</HI> while the righteous are per&s;ecuted to their graves with reproach, and take farewel of the world in darkne&s;s and di&s;|tre&s;s; &mdash; Men are apt to draw the mo&s;t dark and un|comfortable conclu&s;ions, and to imagine that either there is no God, or that human affairs are not under his wi&s;e and righteous admini&s;tration.&mdash; Yea, this has oftentimes been a &s;tumbling-block to the mo&s;t emi|nent Saints, and cau&s;ed their faith to &s;tagger and fail, <HI>their feet have almo&s;t &s;lipp'd,</HI> when they beheld the un|interrupted pro&s;perity of the wicked, and the di&s;tre&s;|&s;ing calamities of the righteous. They have been ready to pour out that melancholy complaint of the P&s;almi&s;t,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>P&s;al.</HI> 73.13</NOTE> <HI>Verily I have clean&s;ed my heart in vain, and
<PB N="25" REF="004295_0028_10041100696F77B8">wa&s;h'd my hands in innocence:</HI> and to join in that pathetic expo&s;tulation of the Prophet: <HI>Wherefore do the wicked pro&s;per? wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherou&s;ly</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jer.</HI> 12.1.</NOTE>? &mdash; And indeed the&s;e would be inextricable difficulties in the di&s;pen&s;ations of pro|vidence, that it would be impo&s;&s;ible to account for, if this were the only life of man, and there were none el&s;e to &s;ucceed it.</P>
<P>But the doctrine of an eternal Judgment &s;catters the clouds that encompa&s;s the paths of divine Provi|dence, clears up the my&s;teries that attend his Govern|ment; and &s;hews the ju&s;tice and equity, the beauty and regularity of his proceedings. For this a&s;&s;ures us, that every &s;ecret iniquity &s;hall be puni&s;h'd with an holy &s;everity, and every vertuous action &s;hall meet with a ju&s;t and &s;uitable recompence. The per&s;ecuted &s;ervants of Chri&s;t &s;hall meet with a di&s;tingui&s;hing reward, while their proud and in&s;olent oppre&s;&s;ors &s;hall be doom'd to a &s;tate of the mo&s;t aggravated mi&s;ery. &mdash; Why then &s;hould the righteous complain of the &s;ufferings of this life, which are but for a moment, and &s;hall be recompenced with a &s;uperior and <HI>an eternal weight of Glory?</HI> &mdash; Why &s;hould they repine at the pro&s;perity of the fooli&s;h, who&s;e enjoyments will vani&s;h as a dream, and prepare them for more &s;evere and intolerable torments? &mdash; This &s;urely may well &s;atisfy men of the Ju&s;tice of divine Providence, even when the greate&s;t difficulties attend it, and his ways appear mo&s;t intricate and my&s;terious.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>This &s;hews us the rea&s;on of God's patience, why he bears &s;o long with the provoking iniquities of men.</HI></P>
<P>Every wilful tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion is an in&s;olent defiance of the eternal Maje&s;ty of heaven, and a daring contempt of his &s;acred authority; impenitent &s;inners challenge almighty Ju&s;tice, and provoke the Lord to jealou&s;y as if they were &s;tronger than he.&mdash; And yet he bears
<PB N="26" REF="004295_0029_1004110205136C58">with a&s;toni&s;hing patience their continual affronts; he &s;pares a guilty world that ungratefully de&s;pi&s;e his goodne&s;s, and abu&s;e his favours to wantonne&s;s and ex|ce&s;s. Notwith&s;tanding their innumerable provocati|ons, he &s;howers down his favours upon them in dai|ly abundance, and fills their hearts with food and gladne&s;s:mdash; from hence they take encouragement in their wickedne&s;s, and flatter them&s;elves that they &s;hall e&s;cape with impunity. They vainly imagine that God does not ob&s;erve their actions, or at lea&s;t that he will not &s;everely puni&s;h them for their crimes. <HI>Becau&s;e &s;entence again&s;t an evil work is not &s;peedily executed, therefore the hearts of the &s;ons of men are fully &s;et in them to do evil</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ecele&s;. <HI>8.2.</HI></NOTE>.&mdash; But how va&s;t is their mad|ne&s;s! how unrea&s;onable is their conclu&s;ion! It is not becau&s;e God is unacquainted with their ways, that he forbears to puni&s;h their rebellions. For <HI>his Eyes run to and fro in the earth, beholding the evil and the good.</HI> The mo&s;t forlorn corner of the world cannot conceal them from his view, nor the darke&s;t privacy bani&s;h them from his pre&s;ence; his Eyes are as a flaming fire, and pierce through the thicke&s;t darkne&s;s; and his diffu&s;ive influence extends to every part of the creation.</P>
<P>It is not any defect of his Power, that can &s;ecure the &s;inner from his avenging wrath; for he made the world by the Authority of a Command, and can de|&s;troy it in a moment by a frown of his countenance. Sinners are always in his hand, and he can at once ea&s;e him&s;elf of his adver&s;aries, and be avenged of his enemies. He can &s;trike dead the intemperate in the height of their jollity, and fill them with the in|venom'd wine of his fury. He can &s;eize the pro|phane &s;wearer in the mid&s;t of his helli&s;h rage, and di&s;patch him out of the world, with his oaths and cur&s;es in his mouth.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="004295_0030_1004110A81DF1870">
It is not becau&s;e divine Ju&s;tice is a&s;leep, that he does not make bare his almighty arm, &s;urpri&s;e the wicked in the very act of &s;in, and hang them up in chains as &s;tanding monuments of his righteous &s;eve|rity. &mdash; But he waits with patience that he may lead them to repentance, and delays the execution of his vengeance to the judgment of the great day. He now &s;eems to wink at the &s;ins of men, to try their reverence for his authority, and obedience to his laws; and has appointed a day for the public triumph of his Ju&s;tice, in the de&s;truction of his implacable adver|&s;aries. He &s;uffers them to remain undi&s;turb'd in their enjoyments, and to wallow in wealth and plenty in this world; but they are fatning for the day of &s;laugh|ter, and are re&s;erved for a more &s;evere adn dreadful execution.</P>

<P N="3">3. <HI>This &s;hews the madne&s;s of unthinking Sinners, who put the evil day far from them, and neglect to prepare for a future judgment.</HI> Since the doctrine of eternal judgment is &s;o evident to the principles of Rea&s;on, and &s;o clearly revealed in the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, it is ju&s;t matter of &s;urpri&s;e and a&s;toni&s;hment, to behold the children of men give a loo&s;e to their vicious inclina|tions, and live in an allowed cour&s;e of impiety and lewd|ne&s;s,

<P>It exceeds all belief, did not melancholy experience make it too plain to be denied, that multitudes of chri&s;tians, who profe&s;s to expect a day of judgment, &s;hould be &s;o &s;lothful and unactive in their preparations for it; that tho&s;e who are convinced, that the wicked &s;hall be condemned in that day, and expo&s;ed to the vengeance of eternal fire, &s;hould yet retain their be|loved lu&s;ts, and continue in as much ea&s;e and &s;ecurity as if the&s;e awful truths were the dreams of enthu&s;ia&s;m, and the wrath of God were no more to be dreaded than an in&s;ignificant &s;carecrow.&mdash; To what &s;hall we a&s;cribe this general &s;tupidity and impiety of men?

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THAT God will judge the World in righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, is a truth agreable to the light of nature, that candle of the Lord, which inlightens every man that comes into the world; and has obtain'd the con&s;ent of all ages, not only among the nations who live in the valley of vi&s;ion and enjoy the &s;upernatural revelation of the Go&s;pel, but al&s;o among tho&s;e who inhabit the regions of dark|ne&s;s, and are &s;trangers to the Covenant of promi&s;e.</P>
<P>Indeed the <HI>Gentile</HI> world had but dark and confu&s;ed notions of a future Judgment; they di&s;gui&s;ed this awful truth under the mo&s;t ab&s;urd and ridiculous ficti|ons; yet the belief of it was almo&s;t univer&s;al: We have frequent intimations of it in the fables of their Poets, the harangues of their Orators, and the pre|&s;cripts of their celebrated morali&s;ts. But tho' they expected a day of future recompence, in which the
<PB N="32" REF="004295_0035_100411249653F528">righteous would be &s;ignally rewarded, and the wicked remarkably puni&s;h'd, yet they were intirely ignorant of the <HI>Per&s;on</HI> by whom this Judgment &s;hould be ad|mini&s;tred, and the &s;urpri&s;ing circum&s;tances that &s;hould attend his approach. This was one of the &s;ecrets of the divine Coun&s;el, which none of the Princes or Phi|lo&s;ophers of the world were acquainted with, and which we could never have di&s;covered by our mo&s;t painful and laborious enquiries, had not God been pleas'd to reveal it unto us in his word; and here we have not only the nature of a future judgment un|folded, but the awful &s;olemnities that will attend it de&s;cribed, and are a&s;&s;ured that the <HI>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is ordained of God to be the Judge of the quick and the dead:</HI> which words afford us this important doctrine for the &s;ubject of our pre&s;ent meditation, <HI>That the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is appointed the &s;upreme and univer&s;al Judge of the world.</HI></P>

<P>Fir&s;t. I am to con&s;ider <HI>how clearly it is revealed in the word of God,</HI> that the Lord <HI>Je&s;us</HI> is appointed the great and univer&s;al Judge of the world.</P>
<P>The &s;upreme power of Judgment belongs to the Ble&s;&s;ed God, who&s;e creatures we are, by who&s;e Laws we are govern'd, and to whom we are accountable for our moral actions: the exerci&s;e of this power is committed to Chri&s;t, the only mediator between God

<P>He is now &s;eated at the right hand of the Maje&s;ty on high, and dwells in inacce&s;&s;ible Glory; the whole creation is &s;ubject to his authority, and he governs the inhabitants of heaven and earth according to his &s;overeign plea&s;ure.

<PB N="34" REF="004295_0037_1004112C132440D8">All human Judgments are &s;ubject to innumerable imperfections, and the cau&s;e of Ju&s;tice is often per|verted through ignorance, partiality and prejudice. To judge the world in righteou&s;ne&s;s, is a work too difficult to be performed by the mo&s;t excellent crea|ture. The Ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> who is in the Bo&s;om of his Father, and is intimately acquainted with the divine &s;ecrets, he alone is capable of this important commi&s;|&s;ion, and he has all tho&s;e qualities which are nece&s;&s;ary to the ju&s;t and impartial di&s;charge of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>His Knowledge is infinite.</HI>&mdash; It is highly requi|&s;ite, that the &s;upreme Judge of the world &s;hould have an exact and intimate acquaintance with all per&s;ons that are brought before him, and a full knowledge of the nature and circum&s;tances of the actions for which they are to be judged.mdash; For want of this, in&s;upera|ble difficulties attend the admini&s;tration of human ju&s;tice: the innocent are oftentimes expo&s;ed to an hard and unrighteous &s;entence, and the guilty e&s;cape the puni&s;hment they have de&s;erved.mdash; But the Judg|ment of the great day will be perfectly free from any uncertainly or mi&s;take; the knowledge of Chri&s;t be|ing univer&s;al and unerring. <HI>All things are naked and open to the Eyes of him with whom we have to do,</HI> Heb. 4.13. He knows the per&s;ons, and is acquainted with all the actions of the children of men. <HI>His Eyes are as flames of fire,</HI> and penetrate into the &s;ecret re|ce&s;&s;es of the &s;oul; he <HI>di&s;cerns the thoughts and intenti|ons of the heart,</HI> the inward motives and de&s;igns of our actions. Tho&s;e abominations which are carefully concealed from the world, and committed in the darke&s;t privacy, are as open to his critical in&s;pection, as if they had been perpetrated in the blaze of day, and expo&s;ed to the public view of the world: for <HI>the darkne&s;s hideth not from him, but the night &s;hineth as. the day,</HI> P&s;al. 139.12. Tho' the wicked fly to un|inhabited de&s;arts, and &s;helter them&s;elves in the dens and caverns of the earth, the&s;e di&s;mal &s;olitudes will
<PB N="35" REF="004295_0038_10041136E0F7ED18">not &s;creen them from the pre&s;ence of their Judge, nor conceal their crimes from his accurate ob&s;ervation. <HI>For be compa&s;&s;eth our paths, and is acquainted with all our ways.</HI> He cannot be abu&s;ed with doubtful evi|dence, deceived by any artful in&s;inuations, nor im|po&s;ed upon by any flattering appearances; but has all that knowledge that is nece&s;&s;ary to form an impartial Judgment.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>His Ju&s;tice is inflexible.</HI>&mdash; Earthly Judges are &s;ubject to corruption, and a righteous cau&s;e oftentimes mi&s;carries, through the partiality and prejudice of tho&s;e who are plac'd in the &s;eat of Judgment. They are &s;ometimes influenc'd by favour and affection, to extenuate the crimes of their friends, or per&s;waded by bribes to pronounce an unrighteous &s;entence. A &s;lavi&s;h cowardi&s;e cau&s;es them to connive at the faults of men of power and e&s;tate, and a &s;ervile fear re|&s;trains them from an impartial execution of public Ju&s;tice. Therefore <HI>Solomon</HI> mentions it as one of the great evils he had &s;een under the Sun, That <HI>he beheld the place of judgment, and behold wickedne&s;s was there, and the place of righteou&s;ne&s;s, that iniquity was there,</HI> Eccl. 3.16. But tho&s;e mean and carnal con&s;idera|tions will have no influence upon the unerring judg|ment of <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> The &s;upreme Governour of the world is infinitely above all &s;u&s;picion of corruption or prejudice, and he will weild the &s;word of ju&s;tice with a &s;teady and impartial hand; he loveth righteou&s;ne&s;s and hateth iniquity, and will make a &s;uitable di&s;tincti|on between his faithful obedient &s;ervants, and his perver&s;e and implacable enemies: the perfection of his nature &s;ecures him from the lea&s;t imputation of inju&s;tice, and his infinite kindne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion a&s;&s;ures us, that he will con&s;ider our frame, and put the mo&s;t favourable con&s;truction upon our actions: he cannot be brib'd by riches, nor aw'd by greatne&s;s and power; for <HI>he is the great and only potentate of heaven and earth, the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords,</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="004295_0039_1004113DE181A6E8">from whom the Princes of this world derive their Power, and to whom they are accountable for their conduct. With him therefore there is <HI>no re&s;pect of per&s;ons,</HI> but the meane&s;t &s;lave &s;hall have as fair a trial as the proude&s;t monarch; Princes &s;hall be dive&s;ted of their imperial diadems, and &s;tand upon a level with their inferior &s;ubjects. Every one &s;hall receive <HI>ac|cording to the things done in the body, whether good or evil.</HI> He will pa&s;s an unalterable doom, not only upon his open and avowed enemies, but al&s;o upon his pretended friends and followers. Secret hypocrites &s;hall be unma&s;k'd to the view of the world, and be expo&s;ed in all their guilt and deformity; tho' they call Chri&s;t Lord, and pretend that they are of the number of his di&s;ciples, yet they will be rejected and condemned by their righteous Judge: with terror in his looks and thunder in his voice, he will <HI>&s;say unto them, Depart from me, for I know you not, ye that work iniquity.</HI> Matth. 7.23. Thus he will judge the world in righteou&s;ne&s;s, and the people with equity; and therefore is admirably fitted for the great work a&s;&s;ign'd him: e&s;pecially if we con&s;ider.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>His power is almighty,</HI> and none can re&s;i&s;t the execution of his will.mdash; How often do we find earthly criminals plac'd above the reach of any human judicature, and defended by wealth and intere&s;t from the puni&s;hment of their crimes? But the great Judge of the world is clothed with omnipotence, and able to execute his vengeance upon the greate&s;t offenders: for <HI>he hath all power in heaven and earth committed unto him,</HI> Matth. 28.18. When he tabernacled in fle&s;h, and was clothed with the infirmities of mankind, univer&s;al nature own'd his dominion, and even Devils were &s;ubject to his authority; the dead were rai&s;ed by the word of his power, and the tempe&s;tuous ele|ments &s;ubmitted to his rebuke: and the power of Chri&s;t will be &s;till more illu&s;triou&s;ly di&s;play'd, when all that are in their graves &s;hall hear his voice, and at
<PB N="37" REF="004295_0040_1004113FD323F2B8">his command &s;hall &s;tart out of their du&s;ty beds; when the righteous &s;hall appear in the &s;hining robes of im|mortal glory, but tho&s;e that de&s;pis'd him upon earth, be condemn'd at his awful barr, and doom'd to un|alterable mi&s;ery. In vain will Sinners fly from his almighty arm, and endeavour to e&s;cape his avenging wrath: Who can contend with offended omnipotence? or &s;ub&s;i&s;t under the terrors of his indignation? The Anger of the mo&s;t enraged Tyrant can only affect the body, and is confin'd within the narrow limits of this Life; but the wrath of our almighty Judge extends to the whole man, accompanies the &s;inner beyond the grave, and endures through eternal Ages. And as he has power to puni&s;h the wicked according to their de&s;erts, &s;o he is able to reward the righteous according to their works: He has man&s;ions of glory prepar'd for their everla&s;ting reception, and will be&s;tow upon them an happine&s;s, va&s;t as their capacities, and immortal as their &s;ouls.mdash; Thus you &s;ee how excellently the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is qualified to be the final Judge of the world: His knowledge is infinite, and extends to the &s;ecret actions of men; his power is almighty, and none can re&s;i&s;t the execution of his will; his Ju&s;tice is inflexible, and will be &s;een in impartially di&s;pen&s;ing Rewards and Puni&s;hments. I proceed,</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>To Enquire into the Rea&s;ons of this Divine Appointment,</HI> why this important Office is devolved upon the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It is in compa&s;&s;ion to the weakne&s;s and frailty of mankind.</HI>&mdash; With GOD is <HI>terrible Maje&s;ty;</HI> He dwells in un&s;ufferable Glory, and the &s;potle&s;s Spirits above vail their faces before his dazling Throne; &s;uch is his un&s;potted purity, that <HI>the heavens are not clean in his &s;ight, and he chargeth his angels with folly: The mountains tremble at his pre&s;ence, and the pillars of hea|ven are a&s;toni&s;h'd at his reproof.</HI> How then could the children of men &s;upport the maje&s;ty of his appearance,
<PB N="38" REF="004295_0041_1004114656B2E9C0">&s;hould he de&s;cend in the naked terrors of the Deity, the unvailed Glories of the Divine Nature! God hath therefore compa&s;&s;ionately ordain'd, that the la&s;t Judg|ment &s;hall be admin&s;tred by one in our nature, <HI>who is bone of our bone, and fle&s;h of our fle&s;h, made in all things like unto us, only without &s;in.</HI> And what can be more de&s;ireable, than to appear before him <HI>who&s;e de|light from eternity has been with the &s;ons of men,</HI> and who &s;hed his invaluable blood to redeem us from eter|nal de&s;truction; who is not only the Judge of the world, but the Saviour of men; who is acquainted with the weakne&s;s of human nature, and the tempta|tions to which we are expo&s;ed; who will make the mo&s;t favourable allowances for the frailties of his Peo|ple! This may convince us with what kindne&s;s, con|de&s;cention and equity, this great tran&s;action will be managed, and a&s;&s;ures us that he will condemn only tho&s;e, who have ob&s;tinately de&s;pis'd his Goodne&s;s, and defeated the endearing methods of his Grace.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Son of Man is appointed to be the Judge of the world, <HI>as a &s;uitable reward for his obedience and &s;ufferings.</HI> This Rea&s;on is expre&s;sly given by St. <HI>Paul,</HI> Phil. 2.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. <HI>Who was in the form of God, and thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made him&s;elf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a &s;ervant, and was made in the likene&s;s of men; and being found in fa&s;hion as a man, he hum|bled him&s;elf and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Cro&s;s: wherefore God hath highly exalted him, and given him a name, which is above every name, that at the name of Je&s;us every knee &s;hould bow, and every tongue &s;hould confe&s;s, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is Lord, to the Glory of God the Father.</HI> It was an amazing &s;toop, for the Son of God to be made in the Likene&s;s of &s;inful Fle&s;h, to de&s;cend from a throne to a manger, from the government of the world to the &s;tate of a &s;ervant, and to &s;ubmit to &s;uch humbling circum&s;tances of poverty and di&s;grace, and at la&s;t to &s;uffer the Death of
<PB N="39" REF="004295_0042_10040FFC8C8FCE18">the Cro&s;s, that he might advance the Glory of God, and procure the Salvation and Happine&s;s of man.&mdash; And what can be more rea&s;onable, than that he &s;hould once more appear, to di&s;play his <HI>glory as the only begotten of the Father,</HI> and convince the world how great and illu&s;trious a per&s;on he is, <HI>God manife&s;ted in the Fle&s;h?</HI> What more &s;uitable than that he who was rejected and de&s;pi&s;ed of men, &s;hould have power to &s;ummon at his awful barr all tho&s;e that in&s;ulted and abu&s;ed him, and puni&s;h them for the indignities they put upon him?</P>
<P>At his fir&s;t coming, his dignity was vailed by the meanne&s;s of his condition, and he appear'd without form or comline&s;s: But is it ju&s;t, that the Sun of righ|reou&s;ne&s;s &s;hould always be cover'd with a cloud? Surely at his &s;econd advent, every Reproach of Chri&s;t &s;hall be wiped away, and he will &s;hine in all the glories of an incarnate God. He was fal&s;ly accu&s;ed by his malicious adver&s;aries, and unju&s;tly arraign'd and condemn'd by the powers of the world: But the &s;cene will be a&s;toni&s;hingly changed, when the Kings and Judges of the Earth &s;hall &s;tand quivering before his tribunal, and receive an irrever&s;ible &s;entence from his mouth. Then every eye &s;hall &s;ee him, not &s;ur|rounded with a croud of in&s;ulting &s;coffers, but attend|ed with an innumerable ho&s;t of adoring Angels; not engag'd in a bloody conte&s;t with the powers of dark|ne&s;s, but with all his enemies &s;ubdued under his feet; not hanging upon a di&s;graceful Cro&s;s, but &s;eated upon a triumphant Throne, and encircled with a &s;hining train of heavenly courtiers. The thorns that pierced his &s;acred head, will be chang'd into a &s;parkling crown of glory; the &s;pear that wounded his &s;ide, into a &s;ceptre of authority and government. <HI>Judas</HI> that betray'd him, <HI>Pilate</HI> that condemn'd him, and all tho&s;e who in all ages of the world have de&s;pi&s;ed and rejected him, &s;hall be confounded at his pre&s;ence, and <HI>call to the mountains to cover them, and the rocks to hide them</HI> from his avenging ju&s;tice.</P>

3. This appointment is de&s;ign'd to <HI>inerea&s;e the vi&s;ible pomp and &s;plendour of the future judgment.</HI> This great affair is to be tran&s;acted in a public and vi&s;ible manner, in the view of the whole world, for the di&s;|play of the divine glory, and the manife&s;tation of his perfections, in the condemnation of a guilty world, and the final reward of his People: God hath there|fore wi&s;ely determined, that the la&s;t judgment &s;hall be executed by a vi&s;ible per&s;on, in the &s;ight and hear|ing of men. God the Father is invi&s;ible: and there|fore <HI>judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son, becau&s;e he is the Son of man;</HI> that every eye may &s;ee him, when he appears on the Throne of Judgment, and every ear may hear that righteous Sentence he will pronounce.&mdash; And how will it in|crea&s;e the glory of that day, to &s;ee the Son of Man de&s;cending in the clouds of heaven, attended by the innumerable company of Angels, the noble army of martyrs, and the general a&s;&s;embly of the Church of the fir&s;t born?

<P N="1">1. <HI>This evidences the Divinity of Chri&s;t, the great Judge of the world.</HI> To judge the world, is the pre|rogative of the &s;upreme God, a Right in&s;eperable from the Crown of Heaven. Who can challenge &s;uch a &s;overeign authority, but he that made the world at fir&s;t by his power, and pre&s;erves it by his gracious providence? To whom &s;hall we give an account of our behaviour, but to him who has given us the&s;e rea|&s;onable natures, and made us moral and accountable creatures? Ju&s;tly then does the Prophet &s;ay, <HI>The Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our Lawgiver, the Lord is our King,</HI> I&s;a. 33.22.&mdash; From him is all inferior authority derived; <HI>by him Kings rule, and Princes de|cree ju&s;tice.</HI>&mdash; And as He is the &s;upreme Judge of the world, &s;o no creature is capable to di&s;charge this important office; for it requires infinite wi&s;dom to know the nature and circum&s;tances of our actions, and almighty power to puni&s;h rebellious Sinners.&mdash; What but the voice of God can awaken the dead, bring them out of their &s;ilent graves, and &s;ummon the whole world before his tremendous Judgment-&s;eat?&mdash; Who but a divine Per&s;on can &s;earch the hearts of men, and unfold the &s;ecret &s;prings of their actions, from whence their malignity or goodne&s;s does principally ari&s;e?&mdash; Since then the Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> is ordain'd to this glorious work, we may ju&s;tly conclude, that he mu&s;t be the great God, as well as the Saviour of the world.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>This takes away the &s;candal of the Cro&s;s, and &s;hews that we have no Rea&s;on to take offence at the meanne&s;s and &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t.</HI> Among all the pre|judices that have been rais'd again&s;t the Go&s;pel, none has had a more fatal influence upon the bulk of man|kind, than the mean and de&s;picable appearance of the
<PB N="42" REF="004295_0045_100414E02A8DF390">great Author of our holy Religion, and the bitter and ignominious &s;ufferings that he underwent. <HI>A cruci&s;ied Chri&s;t was to the Jews a &s;tumbling block, and to the Greeks fooli&s;hne&s;s.</HI> They thought it the highe&s;t ab&s;ur|dity, that the Son of God &s;hould be delivered into the hands of men, and expire upon a &s;hameful Cro&s;s.&mdash; But the firm belief of this truth, that Chri&s;t is ap|pointed to be the Judge of the quick and the dead, takes away the reproach of the Cro&s;s, and removes the darkne&s;s and contempt that attended his &s;uffering &s;tate.&mdash; For this informs us, that his humility and &s;ufferings made way for his advancement and tri|umph, and that he who was &s;o ungratefully abu&s;ed, and &s;o unju&s;tly condemn'd by the Princes of the earth, is now exalted to the Government of the world, and will &s;hortly appear in dignity and power, to the Joy of his friends, and the terror and confu&s;ion of his ad|ver&s;aries. &mdash; Let then the Infidels of the Age de&s;pi&s;e his per&s;on, and deride his &s;ufferings, we are not a&s;ham'd to own, that we are the Di&s;ciples of a cruci|fied Saviour. <HI>God forbid, that we &s;hould not glory in the Cro&s;s of Chri&s;t!</HI> For our Redeemer is great, and greatly to be prai&s;ed: God hath rais'd him up from the dead, and given him a name above every name. We now by faith behold him &s;eated at the right hand of power, and encompa&s;s'd with the triumphant accla|mations of Heaven: but he will &s;hortly rend the Heavens that now conceal his Glory, and appear <HI>in flaming fire to take vengeance on tho&s;e that know not God and obey not the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t:</HI> then &s;hall his enemies bow before him, and lick the du&s;t of his feet; and the dignity of his character and office &s;hall be manife&s;t to the whole world of Angels and men.</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence <HI>the de&s;truction of Go&s;pel-impenitents will be inevitable and intolerable.</HI> Men are apt to &s;helter them&s;elves from the terrors of the Law, by the graci|ous and merciful promi&s;es of the Go&s;pel: They ima|gine, tho' <HI>God is a con&s;uming fire, and wrath from
<PB N="43" REF="004295_0046_100414E8F00F4C88">heaven is declar'd again&s;t all ungodline&s;s and unrighteou&s;|ne&s;s of men,</HI> yet that the merits of Chri&s;t will &s;creen them from the flames of hell, and &s;ecure them a title to im|mortal glory. But the&s;e are wild mi&s;takes, and con|tradict the whole de&s;ign of the Go&s;pel. The ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Je&s;us</HI> indeed is a merciful and compa&s;&s;ionate. Savi|our, but yet he has denounced the &s;evere&s;t dam|nation again&s;t incorrigible finners; his merits will be imputed only to tho&s;e that accept of his offers, and &s;ubmit to his rea&s;onable demands; he will be <HI>the author of eternal Salvation</HI> only <HI>to tho&s;e that obey him.</HI> Such as bear the name and character of Chri&s;tians, and yet by their wicked lives con&s;ute their profe&s;&s;ion, and openly declare that they <HI>will not have this man to reign over them,</HI> will be &s;o far from receiving any advantage by the name of Chri&s;t, that it will be an aggravation of their guilt, and an increa&s;e of their &s;uture condemnation. The <HI>blood of the cove|nant</HI> which they have trampled under foot, will cry aloud for vengeance; and the conde&s;cending mercies of heaven which they have prophan'd and de&s;pis'd, will be turn'd into re&s;entment and fury. They reject the only remedy which infinite grace hath provided for their recovery; and therefore will fall unpitied facrifices to his avenging ju&s;tice. He that now offers to be their compa&s;&s;ionate Saviour, will then appear their inexorable Judge. The meek and innocent Lamb of God will then be arm'd with the terrors of a devouring Lion: and tho&s;e that would not bow to the &s;ceptre of his Grace, &s;hall be broke to pieces with the rod of his Anger. Their doom will be pro|nounc'd by him who was once the me&s;&s;enger of divine Grace, and made them the mo&s;t friendly offers of mercy. This will doubtle&s;s give the bittere&s;t accent to their mi&s;ery, and fill them with the utmo&s;t con&s;ter|nation and horror. How highly therefore does it become us now to &s;ecure an Intere&s;t in his Favour, that &s;o he who will be our Judge, may al&s;o be our Friend!

<P>For the Son of Man &s;hall come in the Glory of his Father, with his Angels; and then he &s;hall re|ward every Man according to his Works.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE di&s;pen&s;ation of the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> is admirably calculated to reclaim a &s;inful world from the paths of error and delu&s;ion; and to per&s;wade the children of men to con&s;ult their duty and happine&s;s: Its <HI>doctrines</HI> are &s;ublime and excellent, worthy of their heavenly de&s;cent, and come recommended to our faith by the brighte&s;t evidences of a divine authority: Its <HI>precepts</HI> contain the noble&s;t rules for our moral conduct, and are happily de&s;ign'd to exalt and purify the nature of man, and advance the univer&s;al pro&s;perity of the world.</P>
<P>And &s;ince we are at pre&s;ent in a corrupt and dege|nerate &s;tate, di&s;inclin'd to our duty, and indeed filled with prejudices again&s;t it; therefore the wi&s;e Author of our Beings hath &s;een fit to enforce his laws by &s;uita|ble <HI>&s;anctions,</HI> and engage us to obedience by the mo&s;t powerful and per&s;wa&s;ive <HI>arguments.</HI> Hence in the
<PB N="47" REF="004295_0050_100414FC84CE3980">Go&s;pel there every where appears the greate&s;t &s;everi|ty to di&s;&s;wade us from &s;in, and the highe&s;t conde&s;cen|tion and goodne&s;s to allure us to holine&s;s.</P>
<P>The Eternal Maje&s;ty of heaven is &s;ometimes re|vealed in the amazing terrors of his <HI>wrath,</HI> as a con|&s;uming fire to the workers of iniquity; at other times he appears in the bright di&s;plays of his <HI>mercy,</HI> as a tender and indulgent father to tho&s;e that &s;erve and obey him: And the great <HI>Saviour</HI> of Souls is repre|&s;ented as one who <HI>dy'd a &s;acrifice</HI> for the &s;ins of the world, and compa&s;&s;ionately invites the children of men to come to him that <HI>they may have life;</HI> but will &s;hortly <HI>appear in flaming fire to take vengeance on tho&s;e that know not God, and obey not the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e different repre&s;entations are wonderfully &s;uited to influence the <HI>hopes</HI> and <HI>fears</HI> of men, the two great ruling pa&s;&s;ions of our nature, and the &s;ecret &s;prings of our actions; and have an happy tendency to deter us from all ungodline&s;s and unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, which lead to de&s;truction and mi&s;ery, and to engage us to a &s;tedfa&s;t adherence to our duty, which is the way to immortality and glory. Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour having therefore urged upon his di&s;ciples the nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>denying them&s;elves, taking up their cro&s;s, and follow|ing Him,</HI> their Lord and Ma&s;ter, in humility and &s;uf|fering, enforces all with this awful con&s;ideration, <HI>That the Son of man &s;hall come in the glory of his Father, with his Angels, and then be &s;hall reward every man according to his works.</HI> In &s;peaking to which words (by divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance) I &s;hall

</LIST></P>
<P>Fir&s;t, I am to con&s;ider <HI>the Manner of Chri&s;t's &s;econd Appearance.</HI>&mdash;When he fir&s;t left the man&s;ions of
<PB N="48" REF="004295_0051_100415008AE57590">glory, and de&s;cended into this lower world, he came in a &s;tate of humility and meanne&s;s, and &s;toop'd to numberle&s;s hard&s;hips and difficulties, that he might an&s;wer the de&s;ign of his manife&s;tation in the fle&s;h, and accompli&s;h the great work of redemption. But his &s;econd advent will be with &s;urpri&s;ing maje&s;ty and glory, to execute vengeance upon the ungodly, and vindicate the cau&s;e of his de&s;pi&s;ed Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>When God came down upon mount <HI>Sinai</HI> to pro|claim the law to the children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> the glory of the Lord appear'd like devouring fire, and the moun|tain was covered with darkne&s;s and &s;moke. So ter|rible was the &s;ight, that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> the friend of God ex|ceedingly fear'd and quak'd; the whole army of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were &s;truck with amazement, and cry'd out in di&s;tre&s;s, <HI>Let not God &s;peak with us, le&s;t we die.</HI>&mdash;If &s;uch &s;ur|pri&s;ing terrors attended the fir&s;t promulgation of the law, with what awful &s;olemnity will the Lawgiver appear, when he comes to <HI>avenge the quarrel of his covenant,</HI> and puni&s;h the profane contempt of his an|thority?</P>
<P>The Scriptures repre&s;ent this awful event in the mo&s;t lofty and magnificent language. Amazing pro|digies will u&s;her in this illu&s;trious day, and proclaim the de&s;cent of our almighty Judge; continual trage|dies will be acted on the great &s;tage of nature, and this lower world will be involved in univer&s;al confu|&s;ion and di&s;order;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Joel</HI> 2.31. <HI>Matth.</HI> 24.29. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 18.7.</NOTE> <HI>the Sun &s;hall be turned into dark|ne&s;s, and the Moon into blood; the Stars of heaven</HI> &s;hall &s;tart from their exalted orbs, <HI>and the powers of the hea|vens &s;hall be &s;haken;</HI> perpetual thunders &s;hall roar from the lower regions of the air, <HI>the earth &s;hall trem|ble and quake, and the foundations of the hills &s;hall be removed.</HI>&mdash;Then &s;hall appear <HI>the &s;ign of the Son of Man in the heavens</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Matth.</HI> 24.30.</NOTE>, and give the world a convincing evidence of the near approach of the great and ter|rible
<PB N="49" REF="004295_0052_10041506346AD6A8">day of the Lord. At which amazing &s;ight, the inhabitants of the earth &s;hall mourn, and the &s;inners in <HI>Zion</HI> &s;hall be horribly afraid.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of their perplexity and di&s;tre&s;s, <HI>the Son of Man &s;hall de&s;cend in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.</HI> He will appear in the pomp and &s;olemnity of an incarnate God, and a&s;&s;ume a glo|ry and magnificence &s;uitable to the dignity of his office.</P>
<P>His <HI>per&s;onal</HI> glory will be inexpre&s;&s;ibly great, his eyes will &s;parkle like flames of fire, his countenance will &s;hine with dazling beams of maje&s;ty and beauty, and his whole body be bright and luminous beyond the Sun in its meridian &s;plendor. Thus he is de|&s;crib'd in the Vi&s;ions of St. <HI>John, In the mid&s;t of the &s;even candle&s;ticks was one like the Son of Man, his head and his hair were white as wool, as white as &s;now, his eyes were as a flame of fire, and his countenance was as the Sun &s;hining in its &s;trength</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rev.</HI> 1.13, 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>He will al&s;o come in the glory of his heavenly <HI>Father,</HI> and be clothed with the authority of the uni|ver&s;al Judge of the world. God has appointed him <HI>King upon his holy Zion,</HI> and proclaim'd an unalterable decree, that <HI>to him every knee &s;hall how;</HI> not in &s;corn and deri&s;ion, as in the days of his infirmity and &s;uffer|ing, but with the deepe&s;t humility and reverence; and <HI>every tongue &s;hall con&s;e&s;s</HI> his royal dignity and power, not with an in&s;ulting &s;coff, but in &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive po&s;tures of adoration.</P>
<P>But to increa&s;e the glory of his appearance, he will be attended with a &s;plendid and numerous <HI>equipage,</HI> becoming the dignity of his per&s;on, and the exalted character he &s;u&s;tains. The innumerable ho&s;t of <HI>Angels</HI> &s;hall leave the man&s;ions of heaven, and attend their de&s;cending Lord, to obey his &s;overeign orders, and adorn the triumphs of his ju&s;tice.

Thus the Patriarch <HI>Enoch</HI> prophe&s;ied of old;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jude</HI> 14.15.</NOTE> <HI>Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thou&s;ands of his Saints, to execute judgment on the un|godly.</HI> And the Prophet <HI>Daniel</HI> a&s;&s;ures us,<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dan.</HI> 7.10.</NOTE> <HI>that thou|&s;and thou&s;ands &s;hall mini&s;ter unto him, and ten thou|&s;and times ten thou&s;and &s;hall &s;tand before him.</HI> And St. <HI>Paul</HI> tells us,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 1.7.</NOTE> <HI>that he &s;hall be revealed from heaven with his mighty Angles.</HI> Tho&s;e &s;potle&s;s Spirit &s;hall be clothed in their brighte&s;t robes of glory, and appear in vi&s;ible &s;plendor to the inhabitants of the earth.

<P N="1">1. <HI>All mankind &s;hall be &s;ummon'd before him.</HI> No &s;ooner &s;hall the Judge de&s;cend to this lower world,
<PB N="51" REF="004295_0054_1004101A8E4B64B0">and erect his throne in the Air, but they that are in their graves &s;hall be awakned out of the &s;leep of death, and all the inhabitants of the world be cited to appear before the Judgment-&s;eat of Chri&s;t.

Thus the Scrip|tures a&s;&s;ure us: <HI>We &s;hall all &s;tand before the judgment|&s;eat of Chri&s;t. Every one of us &s;hall give an account of him&s;elf unto God.</HI> The univer&s;al Father of men <HI>without re&s;pect of per&s;ons judgeth every man according to his work. He accepteth not the per&s;ons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor, for they are all the work of his hands.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> 13.10. x <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.17. <HI>Job</HI> 34.18.19.</NOTE></P>
<P>Civil di&s;tinctions make a mighty &s;ound among men, and per&s;ons of &s;uperior wealth and power are admired and applauded like &s;o many Deities, by their &s;ervile flatterers: hence they are apt to &s;well with pride, upon the account of their elevated circum&s;tan|ces, and vainly hope that they &s;hall be treated with deference and re&s;pect at the future judgment; they flatter them&s;elves that God will not be <HI>&s;trict to mark iniquity</HI> in men of their dignity and &s;tation, but that he will make &s;ome favourable allowances for the ex|ce&s;&s;es and follies which are &s;o common among men of figure and e&s;tate in the world.&mdash;But alas! the&s;e are vain imaginations: the &s;overeign Ruler of the world pays no regard to earthly greatne&s;s, neither has he any value for tho&s;e di&s;tinctions, which are made by birth and e&s;tate. The great Potentates of the earth; who are cry'd up as gods by deluded mortals, are in
<PB N="52" REF="004295_0055_10041511BA0706B8">his &s;ight but contemptible worms of the du&s;t. In that day they will be dive&s;ted of all their &s;tately orna|ments, depriv'd of the en&s;igns of their greatne&s;s and power, and &s;tand upon a level with the meane&s;t &s;lave. Death, the univer&s;al Conqueror, pays no complements to their quality, but arre&s;ts them without ceremony or re&s;pect: and their impartial Judge will irre&s;i&s;tibly &s;ummon them to his tremendous bar. The mighty <HI>Coe&s;ars</HI> and <HI>Alexander,</HI> who have depopulated the earth by their de&s;tructive &s;words, and &s;acrificed nati|ons to their unbounded lu&s;ts, &s;hall tremble at his ap|pearance, and cur&s;e their ambition and madne&s;s. Thus this a&s;toni&s;hing &s;cene is repre&s;ented by St. <HI>John,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rev.</HI> 6.15, 16, 17.</NOTE> <HI>And the Kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, hid them&s;elves in the dens and rocks of the mountains, and &s;aid to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that &s;itteth upon the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb; for the great day of his wrath is come: and who &s;hall be able to &s;tand?</HI></P>
<P>And as none are too great and mighty to be called to an account, &s;o none are too mean and contemptible to be taken notice of. They that have made no figure among men, but have &s;pent their days in want and ob&s;curity, will not be overlook'd in this va&s;t a&s;&s;embly, but &s;trictly examined, whether they have &s;ubmitted to the wi&s;e di&s;po&s;als of providence, and improv'd the talents committed to their tru&s;t.

<P>Finally, while the wicked &s;hall be expo&s;ed in all their guilt and deformity, and be publickly charged with their numberle&s;s tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; God will not be regardle&s;s of the <HI>Saints,</HI> nor <HI>forget their labour of love.</HI> Their heavenly Father knows their works, and with plea&s;ure ob&s;erves their zeal and fidelity in his &s;ervice: Their &s;ecret prayers and tears, their diffu&s;ive charity and beneficence, are &s;et down in the &s;acred records of heaven, and will be mentioned to their immortal honour in the day of the Lord; their patient &s;uffer|ings in the ways of their duty will be carefully re|membred, and their &s;malle&s;t &s;ervices to the Kingdom of Chri&s;t will meet with a va&s;t and un&s;peakable re|ward.&mdash; Thus I am come to the la&s;t thing to be con&s;idered.</P>

<P N="1">1.

Alas! what will it avail you to conceal your wickedne&s;s from the eyes of men, when your mo&s;t &s;ecret actions are vi&s;ible to the God with whom you have to do? What little advantage will you receive by avoiding worldly &s;hame and puni&s;hment, when your &s;ecret enormities will &s;hortly be brought upon the public &s;tage, and di&s;|play'd in their mo&s;t odious colours, to your eternal confu&s;ion?

2. This &s;hew us <HI>the vanity of bypocri&s;y.</HI> For the eyes of our Judge are as flaming fire, and penetrate into the hidden corners of our &s;ouls.

<HEAD>SERMON V. The Nature and Nece&s;&s;ity of Prepara|tion for the Coming of Chri&s;t.</HEAD>

<Q><BIBL><HI>II COR. V. 9.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Wherefore we labour, that whether pre&s;ent or ab|&s;ent we may be accepted of Him.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>OF all the affairs, that employ the time and captivate the affections of the children of men, none &s;o ju&s;tly de&s;erve our attention and concern, as a preparation for that awful day, when we mu&s;t &s;tand before the impartial bar of Chri&s;t, and give an account of the things done in the body. This &s;hould be the work of our early Years, and engage the &s;trength and vigour of our manly age; but alas! it is commonly delay'd to the dark evening of life, 'till the melancholy decays of nature warn us of our approaching end.</P>
<P>The &s;pecious vanities and tri&s;les of the world divert unthinking &s;inners from a &s;erious application to the one thing needful; they flatter them&s;elves, that <HI>the vi&s;ion is for many days,</HI> and they &s;hall have time enough hereafter to &s;ecure the favour of their Judge.</P>
<P>The deluge of waters broke in upon the old world in the height of their &s;ecurity, <HI>whil&s;t they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage,</HI> and
<PB N="63" REF="004295_0066_100415478F3D0428">di&s;patch'd them in a moment into irrecoverable mi|&s;ery: and this pre&s;ent earth, which is re&s;erv'd for the fire of the la&s;t day, &s;hall be de&s;troy'd in as &s;udden and irre&s;i&s;tible a manner. <HI>As it was in the days of</HI> Noah, <HI>&s;o &s;hall it be in the days of the Son of Man.</HI> When the world is drown'd in &s;in and &s;ecurity, and dream of nothing but <HI>peace and &s;afety, then &s;hall &s;udden de&s;truc|tion come upon them, as travail upon a woman with child.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour exhorts his di&s;ciples to continual watchfulne&s;s and diligence. <HI>Take heed, left at any time your hearts be overcharg'd with &s;urfeit|ing and drunkenne&s;s, and the cares of this life, and &s;o that day come upon you unawares; for as a &s;nare will it come on all them that dwell on the face of the earth</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Luk.</HI> 21.24, 25.</NOTE>. And every wi&s;e con&s;iderate man will receive the &s;olemn caution, and avoid the danger of a &s;udden &s;ur|prize: Now this can only be done by making it the great bu&s;ine&s;s of Life to prepare for the coming of our Lord.

Fir&s;t. <HI>I &s;hall con&s;ider what is requir'd of us, that we may be accepted of the Lord in the day of Judgment.</HI> The ca&s;e is practical, and de&s;erves our clo&s;e and dili|gent attention. I &s;hall only in&s;i&s;t on a few general and comprehen&s;ive articles.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>We mu&s;t by faith &s;ecure a title to the Merits and Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t.</HI> We are all by nature involv'd in the guilt of &s;in, expos'd to the condemning &s;entence of the law, and in danger of &s;uffering the vengeance of eternal fire; the holie&s;t of men are encompa&s;s'd with innumerable imperfections, and their be&s;t perfor|mances are defiled with &s;o many blemi&s;hes, that &s;hould God be &s;trict to mark iniquity, who could &s;tand the fiery trial, and appear with &s;afety at the inlightned tribunal of heaven? Hence the humble P&s;almi&s;t vehe|mently deprecates the &s;trict inquiry of ju&s;tice; <HI>Enter not into judgment with thy &s;ervant, O Lord! for in thy &s;ight &s;hall no man living be ju&s;tified.</HI> And the great Doctor of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> tho' among the chief of Saints, and an eminent Apo&s;tle, renounces all confidence in him&s;elf, and <HI>counts all things but lo&s;s, that he may be found in Chri&s;t, not having on his own righteou&s;ne&s;s which is of the law, but that which is through faith in him</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Phil.</HI> 3.8, 9.</NOTE>.&mdash; Not one of the &s;ons of men can perfectly obey the divine commands, nor by any thing that he can do or &s;uffer, appea&s;e the infinite di&s;plea&s;ure of an holy God: But the expiatory &s;acrifice of Chri&s;t com|pleatly an&s;wer'd the demands of ju&s;tice, and by his un&s;potted innocence he vindicated the honour of the law, and purchas'd eternal redemption for his cho&s;en People.</P>
<P>Now if ever we would be acquitted at the bar of God, and obtain the favour of our impartial Judge, we mu&s;t plead, <HI>not any works of righteou&s;ne&s;s that we have done,</HI> but the meritorious obedience and &s;ufferings of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="004295_0068_1004154EA628AD40">
And that we may have a title to his invaluable merits, we mu&s;t by faith accept of him as our only Saviour, and acknowledge him as our &s;overeign Lord and Owner, with an entire dependance on his all|&s;ufficient &s;acrifice, and an unfeigned de&s;ire to obey his excellent precepts; <HI>for he is a Prie&s;t upon a throne, a Prince as well as a Saviour:</HI> And none will be &s;av'd by the merits of his blood, but tho&s;e that &s;ubmit to the &s;ceptre of his government.&mdash; And happy are they who thus by faith receive him upon the terms of the Go&s;pel; for they are deliver'd from the condem|ning &s;entence of the law, and may approach the &s;acred tribunal of Ju&s;tice with an humble confidence of ap|probation and acceptance.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Our natures mu&s;t be &s;anctified by the almighty in|fluences of the Spirit, and renew'd after the image of the ble&s;&s;ed God.</HI> Man by nature is not only involv'd in chains of guilt, but &s;unk into the mo&s;t deplorable &s;tate of deformity and pollution; his under&s;tanding is darkned by clouds of error and ignorance, and filled with mighty prejudices again&s;t the divine and &s;uper|natural my&s;teries of the Go&s;pel: His will is &s;tubborn and refractory, impatient of the yoke of God's autho|rity, and inclin'd to continual rebellion again&s;t him: His affections are captivated to the dominion and tyranny of &s;in, and plac'd upon the mo&s;t degrading and inferiour objects: In &s;hort, the whole man is per|ver&s;ly alienated from the life and &s;ervice of God, and &s;trongly di&s;pos'd to the mo&s;t abominable evils.&mdash; This is the unhappy charcter of man in a &s;tate of unregenerate Nature&mdash; Hence ari&s;es the indi&s;pen|&s;ale nece&s;&s;ity of an holy change, to qualify us for the acceptable &s;evice of God upon earth, and prepare us for the ineffable glories of heaven.&mdash; The under|&s;standing mu&s;t be illuminated by the Spirit of God, to believe the certainty and excellency of things un&s;een and eternal, to perceive the beauty of holine&s;s, and the equity and rea&s;onablene&s;s of the divine command|ments.
<PB N="66" REF="004295_0069_10041555C049DE28">The native enmity of the &s;inner's heart mu&s;t be &s;ubdu'd, and every faculty of the &s;oul brought under a con&s;ection to the &s;ervice of God.&mdash; Till this mighty change is produc'd, the &s;inner <HI>is dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins,</HI> and his mo&s;t perfect &s;ervices are a &s;tench and abhorrence in the no&s;trils of an holy God; and therefore he has nothing el&s;e to expect, but the awful frowns of his incen&s;ed judge, and the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing thunders of his avenging wrath.</P>
<P>The Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is <HI>of purer eyes than to be|hold iniquity, the heavens are not clean in his &s;ight, and his angels he chargeth with folly.</HI> None will be ac|knowledged and accepted by him, in the great day of Judgment, but &s;uch as bear the impre&s;&s;ion of the divine image, who clean&s;e them&s;elves from all filthi|ne&s;s of fle&s;h and &s;pirit, and are perfecting holine&s;s in the fear of the Lord. Without this inward puri|fication, the mo&s;t bright and di&s;tingui&s;h'd profe&s;&s;ion among men will be di&s;approv'd and condemn'd by our all-&s;eeing Judge. Others indeed may have a name in the church upon earth, and pa&s;s for eminent Saints in the &s;ight of the world; but they will be excluded the Sanctuary above, and rank'd among the workers of iniquity, in the day of their deci&s;ive trial.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>A &s;incere and impartial regard to the law of God is nece&s;&s;ary to final acceptance with our judge.</HI> Many that boa&s;t of an high profe&s;&s;ion, and vainly triumph in their Go&s;pel-privileges, are hypocritical in their pretences, and partial in their obedience to the laws of Chri&s;t.&mdash; With the ancient <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> they are &s;trict in their attendance upon the divine wor&s;hip, and zea|lou&s;ly attach'd to the outward formalities of Religion; but unju&s;t and oppre&s;&s;ive in their dealings, carnal and covetous in their conver&s;ations.&mdash; While others build their hopes upon a moral and inoffen&s;ive behaviour towards men, tho' they are &s;adly negligent of their obligations to God, and live in an avow'd contempt
<PB N="67" REF="004295_0070_1004155BFA46F5E8">of his wor&s;hip and ordinances.&mdash; A third &s;ort calculate their Religion for the public view, and make a plau|&s;ble appearance in the Temple, but are &s;trangers to the devotions of the Clo&s;et; they liberally di&s;pen&s;e their alms, when the found of a trumpet proclaims their charity, but are &s;ordidly &s;paring when there is no pro&s;pect of gratifying a vain-glorious humour; they are zealous for the Kingdom of Chri&s;t, when it will advance their honour and intere&s;t, but are cold and indifferent when the great doctrines of Go&s;pel are fallen under reproach, and boidly a&s;&s;aulted by men of figure and e&s;tate.</P>
<P>By &s;uch hypocritical pretences as the&s;e, multitudes lull them&s;elves into &s;ecurity, and vainly imagine to obtain the favour of God. But alas! his all-&s;eeing eye pierces through every di&s;gui&s;e, and marks out the painted formali&s;t, how cautiou&s;ly &s;soever he may be concealed. A partial obedience to the divine com|mands will not &s;tand the trial of an enlightned con&s;ci|ence upon earth, nor be approv'd by the unerring verdict of heaven. <HI>If our hearts condemn us</HI> of any &s;ecret and indulg'd iniquity, <HI>God is greater than our hearts and knoweth all things: but if our hearts condemn us not, then we have confidence towards God,</HI> and may hope for the divine acceptance. 1 Joh. 3.20, 21.</P>
<P>If therefore we would enjoy the te&s;timony of an unreproaching con&s;cience, and receive the euge of our Judge, we mu&s;t have a &s;acred re&s;pect to every duty, without exception or re&s;erve; and be the &s;ame in the &s;ecret clo&s;et, when no Eye but that of God and con|&s;cience is upon us, as when we &s;tand upon the open theatre of the world, and are encompa&s;s'd with a thou|&s;and witne&s;&s;es. We mu&s;t bear an univer&s;al hatred to &s;in, tho' dear unto us as a right hand and a right eye; and particularly watch and &s;trive again&s;t tho&s;e darling ini|quities, which the con&s;titution of our bodies, the di&s;po|&s;ition of our minds, and our company and bu&s;ine&s;s mo&s;t &s;trongly incline us to the commi&s;&s;ion of.

This will afford us a divine &s;upport in the darke&s;t hours of di&s;tre&s;s, and enable us to &s;ay with the in&s;pir'd Apo&s;|t;e, <HI>Our rehoicing is this, the te&s;timony of our con&s;cience, that in &s;implicity and godly &s;incerity, by the grace of God, we have had our conver&s;ation in the world.</HI> 2 Cor. 1.12.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>A frequent Review of our lives and actions, and a judging our &s;elves for our &s;ins,</HI> is an happy preparative for the great day of trial. It is the wi&s;dom of per&s;ons engag'd in worldly bu&s;ine&s;s, frequently to &s;urvey their accounts, and enquire into the &s;tate of their affairs: And it is equally incumbent on the children of light, to examine into the &s;tate of their &s;ouls, that they may know what duties they have omitted, what &s;ins they have been guilty of, and what progre&s;s they have made in the chri&s;tian cour&s;e.&mdash; While we tabernacle in fle&s;h, and are &s;urrounded with &s;o many in&s;naring objects, the be&s;t of men will be &s;ometimes &s;urpri&s;ed into &s;in through the remaining corruption of their na|tures, or overborn by the &s;trength and violence of temptations.&mdash; It is therefore highly nece&s;&s;ary that we frequently review our conduct, and compare it with the law of God, the unerring rule of our duty; that &s;o we may be acquainted with our errors and mi&s;|carriages. &mdash; This will awaken our repentance for our daily offences, and engage us to a fervent appli|cation to the blood of Chri&s;t for pardon, <HI>that fountain which is &s;et open for &s;in and for uncleanne&s;s.</HI>&mdash; This will in&s;pire us with unfeign'd re&s;olutions of amend|ment, and excite our care and vigilance to avoid tho&s;e &s;ins for which we have &s;o &s;everely judg'd and condemn'd our &s;elves.&mdash; And this has a ble&s;&s;ed ten|dency to deep our con&s;ciences clear from indulg'd iniquities, and to prevent that awful &s;urpri&s;e, that mu&s;t &s;eize the impenitent &s;inner, when the midnight|cry

<P>What an un&s;peakable happine&s;s will it then be, to have our con&s;cience puri&s;ied from defiling &s;ins, and all breaches made up between God and our &s;ouls!mdash; Such may hear the &s;ound of the la&s;t trumpet with calmne&s;s and &s;erenity of mind, and &s;tand &s;ecure amid&s;t the &s;hocks of a di&s;&s;olving world.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Continual Meditation upon the certainty and &s;olem|nity of a future Judgment,</HI> is an excellent means to engage us to a &s;erious preparation for it. There's nothing more highly de&s;erves our &s;erious and atten|tive regards, and yet nothing that unthinking &s;inners &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly bani&s;h out of their minds. What &s;ub|ject, of equal importance, can employ our thoughts and engage our attention, as this great and illu&s;trious event? Which will unfold the my&s;teries of divine providence, clear up the difficulties of his government, and di&s;play the perfections of the Deity in their brighte&s;t glories.&mdash;What are all the dazling tri|umph of the mighty Princes and Generals of the Earth, but childi&s;h and de&s;picable trifles, in compari|&s;on with the pompous de&s;cent of our almighty Savi|our, attended with the &s;hining equipage of heaven!&mdash; If now we are affected with the appearance of an earthly Judge, attended with the mini&s;ters of ju&s;tice, to enforce the execution of the law, is it not infinitely more rea&s;onable to employ our thoughts upon that va&s;t and mo&s;t affecting &s;cene, in which all the po&s;te|rity of <HI>Adam</HI> &s;hall &s;tand before the throne of God, and receive an irrevocable &s;entence of happine&s;s, or mi&s;ery, according to their works!&mdash;E&s;pecially if we con&s;ider, that we are all deeply concern'd in this great tran&s;action, and mu&s;t bear a part in the joys and triumphs, or in the fears and terrors of that awful day. The neglect of this great duty is one cau&s;e of the general impiety and wickedne&s;s of the world, and makes them pre&s;umptuous and &s;ecure in the mid&s;t of amazing dangers.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="004295_0073_1004105537E4FD90">
We &s;hould therefore call off our thoughts from the contemptible vanities of time and &s;en&s;e, fix them upon a future Judgment, and con&s;ider its important con&s;e|quences, that &s;o we may be quickned to prepare for that great and terrible day of the Lord.&mdash;I now pro|ceed to con&s;ider,</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Why it &s;hould be the great Study and En|deavour of every Chri&s;tian to prepare for the day of Judgment,</HI> and that he may then be accepted of the Lord.</P>
<P>Now,</P>
<P N="1">1.

He hath a&s;&s;ured us, that <HI>the kingdom of heaven &s;uffereth violence, and the violent take it by force:</HI> He hath commanded us <HI>to &s;trive to enter in at the &s;trait gate; for many will &s;eek to enter in and &s;hall not be able</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mattl. 11.22. Luk. 13.24.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Duties enjoyn'd upon us, are contrary to the corrupt inclinations of fle&s;h and blood, and require the deepe&s;t mortification and &s;elf-denial. The carnal mind is enmity to God, impatient of re&s;traint, and madly bent upon tho&s;e ways that lead to de&s;truction and ruin.&mdash;And what can be a greater difficulty, than to offer violence to our depraved natures, to &s;ubdue our darling luits, and maintain a continual war again&s;t our &s;elves?</P>
<P>And the difficulty is greatly increa&s;ed, by the ex|ternal impediments that attend us. Satan, the grand adver&s;ary of &s;ouls, &s;hoots his invenom'd arrows, on every &s;ide, to wound and de&s;troy us, and u&s;es a thou|&s;and unob&s;erv'd and politic &s;tratagems to entice us
<PB N="71" REF="004295_0074_1004156DDF9E6410">from God and our Duty. The men of the world will revile and per&s;ecute us for our fidelity and dili|gence in the di&s;charge of our duty, and practi&s;e the mo&s;t de&s;tructive Methods to corrupt and defile us. And is it not a laborious ta&s;k to with&s;tand the rage of earth and hell, to re&s;i&s;t the infection of evil exam|ples, and &s;tem the tide of a degenerate age?&mdash; Is it not difficult to oppo&s;e the &s;oft enchantments of vice, and e&s;cape the corruption that is in the world thro' lu&s;t?

Now this mu&s;t be done by every one that would be faithful to the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t, and obtain the ap|probation of his Judge.

<P N="2">2. <HI>This Life</HI> is the <HI>only &s;ea&s;on</HI> allotted for this great work. The foundation of our future happine&s;s mu&s;t be laid in this world, if ever we expect to receive the reward of future glory. We mu&s;t now &s;ow the feeds of righteou&s;ne&s;s, if we would rejoice in a plentiful harve&s;t at the re&s;urrection of the ju&s;t.

<P N="3">3.

They will no longer be able to drown the voice of con&s;cience in floods of wine, nor drive away their melancholy thoughts with mu&s;ick and dancing, with gaiety and entertainment. The Principles of Infide|lity, which are now &s;o greedily imbib'd, again&s;t the repeated admonitions of con&s;cience and to the reproach of human nature, will then afford but a poor and feeble &s;upport.

They will find by &s;ad experience, that <HI>God is not to be mock'd,</HI> that his wrath is not to be trifled with, nor the methods of his grace to be in&s;ulted and bla&s;|phem'd.</P>
<P>What excu&s;e will they plead for their in&s;olent de|fiance of Heaven, their &s;tupid neglect of the invalua|ble offers of a Saviour, their ob&s;tinate continuance in &s;in, in oppo&s;ition to the convictions and &s;trivings of the holy Spirit?&mdash; What defence will they make for their contempt of their bapti&s;inal vows, and their preferring the pomps and vanities of this world, to the favour of God, and the ineffable joys of his prefence?</P>

<P>Under the <HI>Old Te&s;tament</HI>-di&s;pen&s;ation we have clear intimations of this &s;olemn truth.&mdash; <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> the fir&s;t of the in&s;pir'd writers pathetically de&s;cribes it in his &s;acred &s;ong: <HI>Deut.</HI> 32.22. <HI>A Fire is kindled in mine anger, and &s;hall burn to the lowe&s;t bell, and &s;hall con|&s;ume the earth with her increa&s;e; and &s;et on fire the foundations of the mountains.&mdash; David,</HI> the &s;weet P&s;almi&s;t of I&s;rael, prophe&s;ies of this great event, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 50.3. <HI>Our God &s;hall come, and &s;hall not keep &s;ilence: a fire &s;hall devour before him, and it &s;hall be very tempe&s;tuous round about him.</HI> So P&s;al. 102.25, 26. <HI>Of old thou ha&s;t laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of thy bands. They &s;hall peri&s;h, but thou &s;halt endure: yea, all of them &s;hall wax old like a Garment, as a Ve&s;ture &s;halt thou change them, and they &s;hall be changed, but thou art the &s;ame, and thy years &s;hall have no end.</HI></P>
<P>The prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> declares the &s;ame doctrine. Chap. 51.6. <HI>Lift up your Eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath, for the heavens &s;hall vani&s;h away like &s;moke, and the earth &s;hall wax old like a Garment, and they that dwell therein &s;hall die in like manner; but my &s;alvation &s;hall be for ever, and my rightecu&s;ne&s;s &s;hall not be aboli&s;hed.</HI> &mdash; And <HI>Daniel</HI> had
<PB N="81" REF="004295_0084_100410720C09FC48">a di&s;tinct view of this amazing &s;cene in his prophetic Vi&s;ions.&mdash; <HI>And I beheld</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>till the thrones were ca&s;t down, and the Ancient of days did &s;it, who&s;e Gar|ment was white as Snow, and the hair of his bead like pure wool: His throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. A fiery &s;tream i&s;&s;ued and came forth from before him: Thou&s;and Thou&s;ands mini&s;tred unto him, ond ten thou&s;and times ten thou&s;and &s;tood before him.</HI> Dan. 7.9, 10.&mdash; And <HI>Malachi,</HI> the la&s;t of the old te&s;tament prophets, in the Conclu&s;ion of his pro|phecy denounces this awful threatning (Chap. 4. I.) <HI>Behold, the day cometh, that &s;hall burn as an oven; and all the proud, and all that do wickedly, &s;hall be as &s;tub|ble; and the day that cometh, &s;hall burn them, &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts, that it &s;hall neither leave them root nor branch.</HI></P>
<P>But this great truth is more clearly revealed in the <HI>New Te&s;tament.</HI> The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> expre&s;ly a&s;&s;ures us, (2 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 1.7, 8.) <HI>that the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hall be revealed from heaven in flaming fire, taking ven|geance on them that know not God, and obey not the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.</HI> The Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> tells us, in our Con|text, that <HI>the Heavens and Earth which are now, are kept in Store, re&s;erved unto fire, again&s;t the day of judg|ment, and perdition of ungodly men:</HI> And <HI>that the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in which the heavens &s;hall pa&s;s away with a great noi&s;e; and the elements &s;hall melt with fervent heat; the earth al&s;o, and the works that are therein, &s;hall be burnt up.</HI> Thus we find, that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and the Prophets, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and his Apo&s;tles, foretell the future de&s;truction of the world: not by dark and figurative repre&s;entations, but by plain and po&s;itive te&s;timonies.</P>
<P>Nor is there any thing in the <HI>pre&s;ent &s;tate</HI> and <HI>con&s;titution</HI> of the earth, that militates again&s;t this doc|trine, and renders the belief of it ab&s;urd and irrati|onal. On the contrary, the corruptible materials of which this admirable frame is compos'd, the jarring
<PB N="82" REF="004295_0085_10043FB6BA4A2268">elements contain'd in its capacious bo&s;om, expo&s;e it to continual changes and convul&s;ions. It has already pa&s;t through mighty alterations, which have defac'd its Glory, and de&s;troy'd multitudes of its inhabitants.</P>
<P>Soon after this beautiful fabrick was rai&s;ed out of darkne&s;s and confu&s;ion, and the almighty Creator had pronounced of every thing which he had made. <HI>That it was very good;</HI> the whole earth was brought under a <HI>Cur&s;e</HI> for the iniquity of man, and from a fruitful <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI> was turned into a de&s;olate wilderne&s;s, from the &s;eat of innocence and joy it became the abode of guilt and &s;orrow.</P>
<P>When <HI>all fle&s;h had corrupted their ways,</HI> and <HI>the wickedne&s;s of man was great upon the Earth,</HI> God &s;hower'd down a miraculous <HI>deluge of waters,</HI> and &s;wept away the whole world of &s;inners together.</P>
<P>When the Inhabitants of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah</HI> had filled up the mea&s;ure of their &s;ins, and attain'd to the mo&s;t daring height of Impiety and Lewdne&s;s, they were &s;uddenly de&s;troy'd <HI>by fire and brim&s;tone,</HI> and their flouri&s;hing cities were turn'd into heaps of de&s;ola|tion and ruin.</P>
<P>And in all ages of the world there have been terri|ble examples of the divine &s;everity. Whole Coun|tries and Kingdoms have been laid wa&s;te, by fire and &s;word, &mdash; by famine and pe&s;tilence, &mdash; by thunder and lightning, &mdash; by &s;torms and earthquakes. The&s;e things are awful warnings to a guilty world, and &s;tanding evidences of God's ju&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t the workers of Iniquity. The Judgments that he has executed from time to time, loudly declare the Greatne&s;s of his power, and the terrors of his wrath; and may abundantly convince us, that the threatnings of his word are not de&s;ign'd barely to amu&s;e and terrify us, but will be exactly fulfilled in their ap|pointed time.</P>
<P>And <HI>why &s;hould it be thought incredible,</HI> that God who made the world at fir&s;t, as a monument of his
<PB N="83" REF="004295_0086_10043FC5304FD7F8">Power and Goodne&s;s, &s;hould de&s;troy it at la&s;t, to adorn the triumphs of his Ju&s;tice and Holine&s;s? What can be more rea&s;onable than to &s;uppo&s;e, that this Earth, which was de&s;ign'd for the habitation of man, will be di&s;&s;olv'd when its Inhabitants are remov'd off the &s;tage, and &s;ettled in their everla&s;ting abodes?</P>
<P>By what means this a&s;toni&s;hing change will be brought about, is utterly uncertain: but this we know, that there are innumerable fires impri&s;oned in the bowels of the earth, which frequently break forth with a&s;toni&s;hing fury, and have produc'd &s;urprizing alterations in the &s;urface of this Globe; the Air al&s;o that &s;urrounds us, is a continual magazine of thunder and lightning, and fiery Meteors; all which afford abundant provi&s;ion for an univer&s;al Conflagration.</P>
<P>We may therefore &s;uppo&s;e, that at the time ap|pointed in the decrees of heaven, when the end for which this magnificent theatre was erected, &s;hall be accompli&s;h'd, and the &s;ins of men cry aloud for divine ju&s;tice, the great Lord of the Univer&s;e will i&s;&s;ue out his &s;overeign Orders: at which the mighty &s;tores of fire that have hitherto been pent up in the heart of the earth, &s;hall be broke open, flame out, and rage with irre&s;i&s;tible force and fury: all the combu&s;tible materials that are contain'd in the&s;e inferior heavens, &s;hall be &s;et on fire, and de&s;cend in hidious cataracts upon the di&s;&s;olving world. The beautiful order, that has hitherto &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in the works of nature, will then cea&s;e, and the whole &s;ublunary world be involv'd in tumult and di&s;order: The foundations of the earth will be put out of cour&s;e, and all the admired &s;truc|tures of nature and art &s;hall peri&s;h together.</P>
<P>But it is not my de&s;ign to attempt a de&s;cription of this great and terrible day of the Lord; it is beyond the capacity of man, to conceive, and the power of language to expre&s;s the horrors of this amazing Scene. I pa&s;s therefore to the other thing propo&s;ed, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>The world is a &s;trong and prevailing temptation, which wonderfully captivates the hearts of men, and is the unhappy in&s;trument of innumerable pollutions.
<PB N="87" REF="004295_0090_100410824998DD08">Many are &s;o enchanted with wealth and riches, &s;o fond of the pomp and glitter of worldly greatne&s;s, &s;o charm'd with the gay amu&s;ements and plea&s;ures of Life, that they think of nothing but <HI>&s;etting up their tabernacles here;</HI> and entirely neglect their great and immortal intere&s;t: but &s;urely, if we con&s;ider the tran|&s;itory nature of the&s;e enjoyments, it is enough to damp the force of worldly temptations, and put us out of conceit with &s;uch peri&s;hing vanities. Why &s;hould we put our tru&s;t, and place our happine&s;s, in things that are of &s;o &s;hort and momentany a duration; which in a few years at furthe&s;t, will vani&s;h out of our &s;ight, and take their leave of us for ever?

<P>I proceed to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="4">IV. This al&s;o &s;hows us <HI>the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ecuring a more valuable and abiding Inheritance.</HI></P>
<P>Since the world is &s;uch a tran&s;ient &s;cene, and its mo&s;t agreable entertainments are like a morning-cloud, and as the early dew, which will quickly pa&s;s away; it is a Matter of no con&s;iderable con&s;equence, whether our circum&s;tances be pro&s;perous, or afflicting, whether we are carried through the &s;tage of Life with an ea&s;y and plea&s;ant gale, or drove to our long home by &s;torm and di&s;tre&s;s. Our only concern is, to at|tend the duty of our &s;tation, and fulfil the ta&s;k a&s;&s;ign'd us by heaven; that at la&s;t we may &s;afely arrive at the peaceful harbour of happine&s;s and everla&s;ting re&s;t. We are here in a pilgrimage-&s;tate, and are bound for the regions of immortality; nothing therefore de|&s;erves our anxiety and care, but that which will &s;ur|vive our funeral, and pa&s;s over with us into a future world. And, ble&s;&s;ed be God, an heavenly and eter|nal inheritance is offered to our choice, and earne&s;tly recommended to our acceptance: This is the noble&s;t object of our ambition, and &s;hould engage the &s;trength and vigour of all our powers.</P>
<P>Now by the Tenour of the Divine Promi&s;e, as well as the Nature of Things, this can be obtain'd only by tho&s;e that <HI>clean&s;e them&s;elves from all filthine&s;s of fle&s;h and &s;pirit, and perfect holine&s;s in the fear of God;</HI> who <HI>e&s;cape the pollutions of the world,</HI> and are <HI>renewed after the image</HI> of the invi&s;ible God. <HI>What manner of per&s;ons</HI> then <HI>ought we to be, in all holy con|ver&s;ation and Godline&s;s;</HI> that &s;o when all things here

<P N="5">V. The de&s;truction of the world by fire will <HI>heighten the terror and &s;olemnity of a future judgment:</HI> and &s;o the Con&s;ideration of it is a powerful motive to univer&s;al purity and holine&s;s.</P>
<P>The wi&s;e author of our beings hath implanted a principle of <HI>fear</HI> in the hearts of men, to keep them from &s;ecurity and pre&s;umption, to quicken them in their flight from impending dangers. Now what can be more &s;uited to rai&s;e this pa&s;&s;ion in the &s;oul, than the con&s;ideration of that awful time, when we mu&s;t all appear before the judgment-&s;eat of Chri&s;t, and have an irrever&s;ible &s;entence pa&s;s'd upon us, accord|ing to the nature and quality of our actions? But how a&s;toni&s;hingly will the terrors of that day be in|crea&s;ed by the final de&s;truction of this lower world? What confu&s;ion and di&s;tre&s;s will &s;eize the &s;inner, when the heavens from above &s;hall rain down fire and brim&s;tone, and the earth upon which he dwells, &s;hall become one mighty Volcano, and di&s;charge whole rivers of flaming &s;ulphur?</P>
<P>Will it not terrify the hardie&s;t mortals, to &s;ee nature &s;truggling in the agonies of death, and them&s;elves en|compa&s;s'd on all &s;ides with the flames of a di&s;&s;olving world: <HI>The Sun turn'd into darkne&s;s, and the Moon into blood,</HI> and whole cities and countries &s;inking down in a moment into the fiery aby&s;s below! How will they &s;upport the&s;e vi&s;ions of horror and amaze|ment, or whither will they fly for &s;afety and defence? If they a&s;cend to the top of the loftie&s;t mountains, there they will be expo&s;ed to the hot thunderbolts of divine fury: If they de&s;cend into the gloomy caverns of the earth, there they will be &s;wallowed up in an Ocean of liquid fire. In &s;hort, wherever they go, the vengeance of an incen&s;ed God will pur&s;ue them,
<PB N="90" REF="004295_0093_1004108EAE4202B0">and make them the monuments of his almighty di&s;|plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>And now what more powerful argument can be u&s;ed with &s;inful mortals to awaken them out of their impenitence and &s;ecurity? If infinite ju&s;tice cannot affright them from their &s;ins; if the pro&s;pect of a di&s;&s;olving world leave no abiding impre&s;&s;ions upon them; they appear to be lo&s;t, beyond all po&s;&s;ibility of recovery: and it is to be fear'd, they belong to the number of tho&s;e hardned wretches, who are re|&s;olv'd to &s;torm hell, and take the kingdom of dark|ne&s;s by violence.</P>
<P N="6">VI. This al&s;o has a prevailing influence upon the people of God, <HI>as it gives them a bright di&s;covery of the love of Chri&s;t, who will &s;ave them from the terrors of this amazing day.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' this will be a day of tribulation and angui&s;h to impenitent &s;inners, yet it will be a time of joy and refre&s;hment to the Saints. <HI>For the Lord knoweth how to deliver the Godly, and re&s;erve the unju&s;t to the day of judgment to be puni&s;hed</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.9.</NOTE> St. <HI>Paul</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, that the righteous &s;hall be &s;eparated from the wicked, and re&s;cued from the calamity, in which all things el&s;e &s;hall be involv'd. <HI>For the Lord him&s;elf &s;hall de|&s;cend from heaven with a &s;hout, with the voice of the Archangel and the trump of God; and the dead in Chri&s;t &s;hall ri&s;e fir&s;t: Then we which are alive, and re|main, &s;hall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and &s;o &s;hall we ever be with the Lord</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 4.16, 17.</NOTE> What an endearing expre&s;|&s;ion is this of the love of God our Saviour? What obligations are we under, to be&s;tow upon him our be&s;t and deare&s;t affection? In fine, what mighty en|couragement does it afford us now to di&s;entangle our affections from this en&s;naring world, to be fruitful in every good work, to have our conver&s;ation in heaven;
<PB N="91" REF="004295_0094_10043FEC9DBC3E60"><HI>that &s;o we may be accounted worthy to e&s;cape all tho&s;e things, which &s;hall then come to pa&s;s, and may be able to &s;tand with confidence before the Son of Man at his ap|pearing.</HI></P>
<P>The APPLICATION of my di&s;cour&s;e remains: which I &s;hall di&s;patch in a &s;erious and earne&s;t Exhor|tation to &s;everal &s;orts of per&s;ons.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Let tho&s;e that are in</HI> Youth, <HI>be per&s;waded by the&s;e powerful motives that have been &s;et before them, to all holy Conver&s;ation and Godline&s;s.</HI> &mdash; You are ex|ceeding apt to bani&s;h all &s;erious Thoughts out of your minds, and to imagine that it will be time enough hereafter, to attend to religious Concerns, when you have taken a &s;urfeit of the Gaieties and Plea&s;ures of Life. Youth is naturally unthinking; and &s;trongly inclin'd to &s;en&s;ual enjoyments. Their con&s;titutions are ordinarily firm and robu&s;t; not broken with fa|tigue, impair'd by &s;ickne&s;s, or worn out with age. Their pul&s;e beats high, their blood circulates bri&s;kly through their veins, and all the powers of nature are in their highe&s;t &s;prightline&s;s and vigour: Their appe|tites are eager, their pa&s;&s;ions are head-&s;trong, and &s;o apt to hurry them into all manner of riot and exce&s;s, contrary to the &s;acred rules of virtue and &s;obriety. They e&s;teem Religion too dark and melancholy an entertainment for the flouri&s;hing bloom of life, and fit for none but tho&s;e who&s;e temper is &s;oured with lo&s;&s;es and di&s;appointments in the world, and who&s;e &s;trength is wa&s;ted with &s;ickne&s;s or age. Hence they give an unbounded loo&s;e to their vicious inclinations, and wallow in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t &s;en&s;ualities.</P>
<P>But make a pau&s;e, I be&s;eech you, in the mid&s;t of your mad career, and con&s;ider what will be the con&s;e|guence of your actions; <HI>Know it, that for the&s;e things God will bring you into judgment,</HI> and call you to a &s;trict account &s;o: your youthful follies. You may
<PB N="92" REF="004295_0095_10041091C788BDD0">now drink wine in bowls, and &s;ing away your cares, &s;pend your days in mirth, and your years in vanity and plea&s;ure; but the&s;e are dying comforts, &s;hort|liv'd enjoyments, which will &s;oon end in di&s;appoint|ment and &s;orrow. The &s;prightline&s;s of Youth, the &s;trength of your con&s;titutions, is no Protection again&s;t the &s;udden arre&s;ts of Death, and the inevitable &s;um|mons of your almighty Judge. How many of your companions have been cut off in the flower of their days, and di&s;patch'd into an eternal world, without any warning? And have you any &s;ecurity, that this &s;hall not be your ca&s;e? On the contrary, have you not the greate&s;t rea&s;on to fear, that whil&s;t you are re|velling in your intemperate plea&s;ures, and madly pur|&s;uing your guilty de&s;igns, while you are flattering your &s;elves with the pro&s;pect of long life and pro&s;pe|rity, and dream of nothing but peace and &s;afety, the fatal Period will come upon you in a moment, and overwhelm you with &s;wift and unavoidable ruin? <HI>Knowing then the terrors of the Lord, we per&s;wade you,</HI> to break off your Sins by unfeigned Repentance, and get reconciled to God, and prepar'd to die.&mdash; O fly to the great Saviour of the world, who alone can &s;ecure you from the flames of vindictive Ju&s;tice: Cry to him mo&s;t importunately for the powerful in|fluences of his Spirit, to clean&s;e your polluted Souls; that you may be found of your Judge in peace, with|out &s;pot and blamele&s;s.&mdash;But I pa&s;s,</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>To apply this Exhortation to tho&s;e that are in the</HI> Evening of Life, <HI>and have hitherto neglected to prepare for the approaching di&s;&s;olution of all things.</HI></P>
<P>With what confidence will you, under your heavy Loads of Guilt and Defilement, be able to hold up your heads at the bar of Chri&s;t? Can you hope to appear with Safety before his Judgment-Seat, who have hitherto &s;pent your time in the neglect of his Authority, in di&s;obedience to his Go&s;pel, and profane
<PB N="93" REF="004295_0096_10043FEE5FE275D8">contempt of his ine&s;timable Blood? Ala&s;s, your days decline apace, your Sun is almo&s;t &s;et, and <HI>the Night</HI> ha&s;tens upon you, <HI>wherein no man can work.</HI> O then &s;eize the flying moments, and trifle no longer with your eternal Concerns; humble your &s;elves in the du&s;t for your aggravated Iniquities, and turn from all your Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions. <HI>Fly for Refuge to Chri&s;t,</HI> and <HI>give glory to the Lord your God, before your feet &s;tumble upon the dark mountains,</HI> and before the terrors of a future judgment &s;urprize you. O <HI>how will you e&s;cape, if you neglect &s;o great Salvation!</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. Let what we have heard put the <HI>Children of God</HI> upon diligent endeavours to <HI>grow in Grace, and in the Knowledge of Chri&s;t,</HI> to increa&s;e in univer&s;al holine&s;s, that they may be better prepar'd for the awful Events they are expecting, and which will &s;urely come to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>To quicken our Zeal and Activity in the Chri&s;tian Life, let us frequently be looking forward to that important day, when our de&s;cending LORD &s;hall make <HI>the clouds his chariot, and &s;hall ride upon the wings of the wind;</HI> when the Heavens &s;hall bow be|fore him, <HI>and the rocks &s;hall melt at his pre&s;ence, and a fire &s;hall go before him to burn up his enemies on every &s;ide.</HI>&mdash;Con&s;ider how va&s;t will be the joy of tho&s;e holy Souls, who &s;hall be &s;aved from the ruins of a burning world, and be admitted <HI>into the new hea|vens and the new earth, wherein dwells righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> And let the pro&s;pect of this happy &s;tate engage us to unfainting indu&s;try in the &s;ervice of God our Savi|our, to a con&s;tant &s;eparation from the defiling cor|ruptions of the world, and unto a Care to have our Conver&s;ation in Heaven: then we may be a&s;&s;ured, that the day of Chri&s;t's &s;olemn appearance will be the day of our complete and eternal Redemption. While un|godly Sinners &s;hall tremble at the Pre&s;ence of their righteous Judge, and at the &s;ight of a di&s;&s;olving
