<P>&mdash; Without any Order.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE <HI>Words</HI> are &s;poken by holy <HI>Job</HI> of <HI>Death</HI> and the <HI>Grave,</HI> which he tho't ju&s;t before him, and where he wi&s;h'd to have been, by the Will of GOD. "<HI>I go</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>whence I &s;hall not return, even to the land of darkne&s;s and the &s;hadow of death,</HI> WITHOUT ANY ORDER, <HI>and where the light is as darkne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT a dark &amp; melancholly, not to &s;ay di&s;mal De&s;cription is here of the vi&s;ible &s;tate of the <HI>Dead?</HI> and how are the gloomy words doubled and trebled to repre&s;ent the thick <HI>Darkne&s;s;</HI> a darkne&s;s to be felt and &s;een; not by the dead that neither &s;ee nor feel, but by the <HI>living who lay it to their heart.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="003009_0004_0FEFDD622B8D3738">
BUT it is not the <HI>darkne&s;s</HI> of the Grave that I am now to in&s;i&s;t on, only as one part of the darkne&s;s lies in the words of my <HI>Text, Without any Order.</HI> Indeed <HI>Order</HI> is not to be expected in <HI>darkne&s;s.</HI> Dark|ne&s;s implies di&s;order, and the place of <HI>Order</HI> is where Light dwelleth. Were the light of the <HI>Sun</HI> put out, what di&s;order would pre&s;ently follow upon Earth? Such a <HI>Connexion</HI> is there between Order and Light in the nature of things, and between Darkne&s;s &amp; Di&s;|order.</P>
<P>BUT to drop the connexion of the words;</P>
<P><HI>JOB</HI> &s;eems to &s;peak here, 1. of the <HI>time</HI> &amp; <HI>man|ner</HI> of Deaths coming on one and another, that we can ob&s;erve no <HI>Order</HI> in the thing: 2. of the <HI>vi&s;ible State</HI> of the dead, the <HI>Grave,</HI> where we find no Order at all; natural, civil or religious. It is <HI>a land of dark|ne&s;s without any order.</HI></P>
<P>DOCT. <HI>DEATH &s;eems not to us to ob&s;erve and keep any Rule &amp; Order in it's taking away one and another; and the vi&s;ible State of the dead is without any Order.</HI></P>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>DEATH &s;eems not to us to ob&s;erve and keep any Rule &amp; Order, in its taking away one and another.</HI> I &s;ay not, that it does not <HI>ob&s;erve</HI> the be&s;t and mo&s;t exact Order, but that this Order does not <HI>appear</HI> to us.</P>
<P>IT certainly has its Order from GOD as to every one it takes away, when and in what manner they &s;hall die. It certainly proceeds in a wi&s;e and good Or|der by his Will and Direction. Yet we are not &s;en&s;ible of any fixed Rule that it goes by. &mdash; To be &s;ure every one dies in his <HI>own Order;</HI> in his appointed time and hour, which is order'd exactly and performed by GOD as it &s;hou'd be: whether in Judgment, or in Mercy.</P>
<P>DEATH has it's Order from the LORD OF LIFE, the ju&s;t <HI>Rewarder</HI> and the righteous <HI>Judge.</HI> There is <HI>an appointed time to Man upon Earth, the number of his months</HI> and days <HI>are with GOD; his bounds
<PB N="3" REF="003009_0005_0FEFDD6ECC475F20">are determined</HI> to an hour and a minute, which <HI>he cannot pa&s;s.</HI> Not <HI>a Sparrow,</HI> and much le&s;s any Child of <HI>Man, falls to the ground without the will of our</HI> FATHER <HI>in Heaven</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Job vii. 1. Matth. x. 29.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AND be &s;ure the Maker and GOD of our Spirits does all things well, in perfect Wi&s;dom and Order. Death is kept in GOD'S own hand, or (which is the &s;ame thing) it is put into the hand of CHRIST, <HI>the Only-begotten of the</HI> FATHER: It is in the be&s;t Hand: Never the le&s;s we cannot ob&s;erve the Order that it keeps; either,

</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. As to the <HI>Time</HI> of Death's coming to one and another, it &s;eems <HI>without any Order.</HI> We cannot ob|&s;erve any <HI>natural</HI> Order, nor <HI>moral,</HI> nor <HI>political</HI> in the approach of Death, here or there.</P>
<P N="1">1. No <HI>natural</HI> Order. By which I mean, according to the cour&s;e of <HI>Nature;</HI> as to us it would &s;eem order|ly for the <HI>Elder</HI> to go before the Younger, and <HI>Pa|rents</HI> before their Children. But Death ob&s;erves no &s;uch Order of Nature and Age. Younger Per&s;ons do often die <HI>before</HI> their Elders, and Children before their Parents. At the next door again, the Elder dies before the Younger; the Parents before the Children.</P>
<P><HI>SIN</HI> that bro't in Death broke in upon this &s;eem|ing natural Order, and the natural De&s;ires both of Pa|rents and Children. For <HI>Parents</HI> naturally and &s;trongly de&s;ire, if it may plea&s;e GOD, that their Children may out-live them; and <HI>Children</HI> naturally hope and expect to out-live their Parents, by the Will of GOD. But the <HI>fir&s;t Death</HI> we read of broke this Order, namely <HI>Abel's;</HI> and how many more of their Children <HI>Adam</HI> &amp; <HI>Eve</HI> liv'd to bury we know not. But this we know that the <HI>be&s;t</HI> among their fallen Offspring &s;hare in this Grief after them.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="003009_0006_0FEFDD71CE91F330">
SOMETIMES the younge&s;t Children of the Family die fir&s;t, the <HI>Youth</HI> dies before the Adult, the <HI>Adult</HI> before the <HI>Aged,</HI> and the <HI>Hoary Head</HI> follows many an <HI>Infant</HI> to the Grave. But neither is <HI>this</HI> Order kept to by Death, for &s;ometimes an <HI>I&s;aac</HI> and a <HI>Jacob</HI> die in a good old Age, with their Sons about them.</P>
<P N="2">2. DEATH &s;eems not to regard or keep any <HI>Moral Order</HI> in its approch to one and another. The <HI>Good</HI> die before the bad, and the <HI>bad</HI> again before the Good; here the Righteous before the Wicked, and there the wicked before the Godly. Here <HI>the wicked is driven away in his wickedne&s;s,</HI> and there he <HI>lives old and is mighty in power.</HI> Here the Godly die <HI>young</HI> de&s;ired and lamented, and in the mid&s;t of their u&s;efulne&s;s; and there their <HI>hoary head is a Crown of glory in the ways of Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> The lea&s;t worthy and fit to live, as we are ready to think, do often out-live their betters; and tho&s;e of whom the World is not worthy, a <HI>Jo&s;iah,</HI> the <HI>Bapti&s;t,</HI> a <HI>Stephen,</HI> are taken away young; lament|ed and bewailed. <HI>Good Men</HI> are ready to call this <HI>without any Order,</HI> while they <HI>mourn</HI> the early Deaths of the wi&s;e and prudent, the pious and godly, the u&s;e|ful and profitable; and while they <HI>groan</HI> under the u&s;ele&s;s and hurtful prolonged Life of the wicked.</P>
<P N="3">3. DEATH &s;eems not to regard any <HI>Political or Civil Order</HI> among Men, in its approaches to one &amp; another. It regards no Di&s;tinction, Rank, or Degree of Men, in State or Church. The Noble and Ignoble, the Lord or the Slave, the Ma&s;ter and the Servant, are treated ju&s;t alike by Death. There is no <HI>Precedency</HI> kept to. The <HI>Prince</HI> does not go <HI>fir&s;t</HI> here, and his <HI>Nobles</HI> next; nor do they affect or de&s;ire it.</P>
<P>If the fir&s;t in <HI>Quality</HI> and <HI>Rank</HI> were fir&s;t to die, 'twould &s;poil all the <HI>Order</HI> and State and Glory of the World that now is; and turn it up&s;ide down. <HI>Crowns</HI> would grow cheap, and Men would &s;hun the Honours they now court and pride in. The Order that <HI>Courts</HI> and <HI>Parliaments</HI> wou'd be ready to make,
<PB N="5" REF="003009_0007_0FEFDD7382059400">if they had power to Enact about the Time of Death, would be for the <HI>poor</HI> &amp; <HI>low</HI> to go to the Grave <HI>before</HI> their Superiours. But <HI>Riches profit not,</HI> nor Dignity and Power, in the day of Death. None of 'em can by any means deliver Him&s;elf, nor redeem his Brother. <HI>Princes die young,</HI> in the mid&s;t of all their Bloom and Hopes, or of their Fame and Glory; and <HI>Pea&s;ants live old</HI> in their low and homely Cottages. This is <HI>with|out any Order,</HI> in the account and eye of this World.</P>
<P>BUT this for the <HI>Time</HI> of Death's coming to one and another, <HI>without any Order.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. As to the <HI>Manner</HI> and <HI>Circum&s;tances</HI> of one and anothers dying, Death keeps to no Order. The rich and the poor, the high and the low, the Parent and the Child, the young &amp; the old, the Friend &amp; the Enemy, they die alike; or quite differing one from the other: &s;ome a natural Death, &s;ome a violent, or by evil Accidents. The <HI>moral</HI> Characters of Per&s;ons are no &s;ecurity here, <HI>All things come alike to all, there is one Event to the righteous &amp; to the wicked, to the clean &amp; to the unclean; as is the good &s;o is the &s;inner,</HI> Eccl. 9.2. The Sons of <HI>Job,</HI> and tho&s;e of <HI>Aaron</HI> were &s;truck dead, as well as <HI>Onan</HI> and <HI>Ananias</HI> in their Sin. The &s;ame Fevers or Drop&s;ies, the &s;ame Con&s;umptions, or the &s;ame Stu|pors and Lethargies, &s;ei&s;e and carry off one and another. The &s;ame Pains &amp; Torments rend and tear Per&s;ons of the mo&s;t different Characters; whether on worldly Accounts, or on moral and religious. And the &s;ame noi&s;ome Di&s;ea&s;es corrupt the Bodies, and de&s;troy the Lives of Saints and Sinners; of <HI>Lazarus</HI> and of <HI>Herod.</HI> The hard and the ea&s;ie Death, is common to good and bad, young and old, rich or poor, Parent and Offspring. <HI>Queens</HI> in their Palaces and fine linnen, and <HI>Beggars</HI> on the dunghil and in their rags, die of the &s;ame Sores and Ulcers. <HI>Kings</HI> die by evil Accidents, and by the hand of Violence, as well as others; and one as well as another prolong their dayes and <HI>die in their ne&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="003009_0008_0FEFDD75D82AEF78">
ONLY let us except here the <HI>la&s;t and utmo&s;t Di&s;order</HI> in Death, the <HI>dying as a fool dieth,</HI> wickedly and wilfully by his <HI>own hands,</HI> or impiou&s;ly in <HI>brutal DUELS;</HI> which is but another way of SELF-MUR|DER. The&s;e unnatural and dete&s;ted <HI>wayes</HI> of dying are not to be named or &s;uppo&s;ed, when we &s;peak of the <HI>Manner and Circum&s;tances</HI> of one and anothers Death. Let <HI>the&s;e</HI> be proper for the <HI>impious</HI> and un|godly, and to them alone if you will, and <HI>out</HI> of the pre&s;ent Argument, as they ought not to be once named in the World; how common &s;oever they have been in it.</P>
<P>BUT this for the <HI>fir&s;t Propo&s;ition: Death</HI> &s;eems not to ob&s;erve and keep any Rule or <HI>Order</HI> in its taking away one and another, whether we con&s;ider the <HI>Time</HI> or <HI>Manner</HI> of its coming.</P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>THE vi&s;ible State of the dead,</HI> that is, <HI>the Grave, is without any Order.</HI></P>
<P>AND <HI>this</HI> &s;eems to be the meaning of the <HI>Text, A land of darkne&s;s as darkne&s;s it &s;elf, without any Order.</HI> But here we &s;peak only of the <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> State of the dead, not of the <HI>invi&s;ible.</HI></P>
<P>FOR if we look by Faith into the <HI>invi&s;ible</HI> World and State, there we behold the mo&s;t perfect and <HI>glo|rious Order.</HI> The good and the bad, the godly and the wicked are in their proper place; <HI>Judas</HI> in his, and the repenting <HI>Thief</HI> (thro' Grace) in his; namely the <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI> of CHRIST prepared for <HI>Penitents</HI> from the foundation of the World. The Servants of <HI>Sin</HI> and of <HI>Satan</HI> decea&s;ed, are gone accur&s;ed <HI>into everla&s;ting Fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels,</HI> but the <HI>Dead in</HI> CHRIST are in the <HI>Man&s;ions</HI> in the FATHER'S <HI>Hou&s;e.</HI> This is mo&s;t <HI>exact Order,</HI> without re&s;pect of Per&s;ons, every Man according to his Works; the degrees of Reward and Puni&s;hment bearing a ju&s;t Proportion to the degree, of Grace and labours of Love, and to the mea&s;ures and degrees of Sin and Wickedne&s;s done in the Body. This is the bright and &s;hining Order in the un&s;een and eternal State: Matth. 25. ult. <HI>The&s;e &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting Puni&s;hment, but the Righteous
<PB N="7" REF="003009_0009_0FEFDD7787B0BC18">into Life eternal.</HI> Dan. 12.2, 3. <HI>And many of them that &s;leep in the du&s;t of the Earth &s;hall awake, &s;ome to everla&s;ting Life, and &s;ome to Shame &amp; everla&s;ting Con|tempt: And they that be Wi&s;e &s;hall &s;hine as the bright|ne&s;s of the Firmament, and as the Stars for ever &amp; ever.</HI></P>
<P>BUT if we look, with the&s;e mortal Eyes, into the <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> State of the dead, both the godly &amp; ungodly, it it is altogether <HI>without any Order.</HI> All go to one place, and all ly mixt and <HI>confu&s;ed</HI> there. All turn to <HI>du&s;t</HI> again, and ones du&s;t has no Preheminence to &s;ight and &s;en&s;e above anothers, no Di&s;tinction from the others: Alike do they <HI>&s;leep</HI> in the du&s;t, and are covered in dark|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>INDEED a Grave-&s;tone may here and there inform you who&s;e Body was laid in this place, and who&s;e in that; that this was once <HI>Noble</HI> or <HI>Royal,</HI> and that <HI>vul|gar</HI> and <HI>common,</HI> but take away the <HI>Monument</HI> and no appearance remains of Family and Blood, nor of Order civil or &s;acred among the dead. There <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Coun&s;ellors</HI> of the Earthly in their de&s;olate Places, and there lies the hidden and <HI>untimely Birth,</HI> that never faw the light: There lies the <HI>Tyrant</HI> and Oppre&s;&s;or, and there his <HI>Pri&s;oners</HI> are at re&s;t together by him: <HI>The &s;mall and the great are there, and the &s;ervant is free from his ma&s;ter,</HI> Job 3.18, 19. There ly the A&s;hes of the <HI>wi&s;e,</HI> the learned, the virtuous and reli|gious, and there the <HI>fool and bruti&s;h Per&s;on,</HI> that had neither Head nor Heart for any thing great and good, <HI>Like Sheep they are laid in the Grave, Death feeds on them,</HI> and the <HI>Worm</HI> is the only <HI>Relative</HI> that remains to them.</P>
<P>YET again, The Order of the <HI>Univer&s;e</HI> cea&s;es in the Grave. There is neither Light nor Darkne&s;s, Heat or Cold, Day or Night, Summer or Winter known there. There is no <HI>Knowledge, Work or Device the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">,</HI> no Good or Evil, Joy or Sorrow done or felt there: Nei|ther is there Friend&s;hip or Enmity, Love or Hatred there. Eccl. 9.5, 6. <HI>The dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a Reward, al&s;o their Love and their Hatred and their Envy is peri&s;hed; neither
<PB N="8" REF="003009_0010_0FEFDD793773A208">have they any more a Portion for ever in any thing that is done under the Sun.</HI></P>
<P>Finally, THERE is no <HI>religious Order</HI> in the Grave; no not in the Tomb of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and among the bodies of the <HI>Ju&s;t.</HI> There is no <HI>Wor&s;hip,</HI> no Prai&s;e or Prayer, in that place of &s;ilence no <HI>Sabbath</HI> there, tho' a con|tinual <HI>Re&s;t</HI> &amp; quiet. This was the Darkne&s;s &amp; <HI>Di&s;|order</HI> of the Grave to the pious <HI>King,</HI> I&s;a. 38. <HI>I &s;aid in the cutting off my days, I &s;hall no more &s;ee the</HI> LORD <HI>even the</HI> LORD, <HI>in the land of the living; I &s;hall be|hold Man no more with the Inhabitants of the Earth:&mdash; For the Grave cannot prai&s;e thee, Death cannot cele|brate thee, they that go down to the Pit cannot hope for thy Truth: The Living, the living he &s;hall prai&s;e thee, as I do this day; the Father to the Children &s;hall make known thy Truth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>WORSHIP</HI> is the holy <HI>Order</HI> &amp; Beauty both of this World and of that to come: This therefore is the Darkne&s;s of the Grave, that there is nothing of this holy Order in it, the <HI>Beauty of Holine&s;s:</HI> P&s;alm 30.9. <HI>When I go down to the Pit, &s;hall the du&s;t prai&s;e thee? &s;hall it declare thy Truth?</HI> P&s;al. 115. u&s;t. <HI>The dead prai&s;e not the</HI> LORD, <HI>neither any that go down into &s;ilence; but we will ble&s;s the</HI> LORD <HI>from this time forth and for evermore.</HI></P>
<P>WE have look'd thus into the <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> State of the dead, and we find it <HI>without any Order;</HI> without Sun or Stars, Sen&s;e or Motion, Relation or Condition, Wor|&s;hip or Sabbath.</P>
<P>I come now to make &s;ome USE and IMPROVEMENT of this <HI>Meditation.</HI> And if this be one point in the Darkne&s;s of <HI>Death,</HI> that it is <HI>without any Order?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t</HI> then, We &s;ee &s;omething very <HI>valuable</HI> in the Land of the living, and that is <HI>Order;</HI> and we learn, on the contrary, that next to <HI>Death</HI> is <HI>Di&s;order</HI> and Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="003009_0011_0FEFDD63D9C62118">
THE Beauty of the <HI>Univer&s;e,</HI> of the natural and moral World, the U&s;efulne&s;s of things in it and the Fe|licity of the Creatures, depend upon the excellent <HI>Order</HI> that GOD has con&s;tituted. <HI>The LORD is a GOD of Order.</HI> His Works declare it, his Word and Law pre&s;cribe and require it. Decency and Order go together, and &s;o do Order &amp; Right. Every thing is beautiful and right in its time and order.</P>
<P>WHAT was the Work of <HI>Creation?</HI> but GOD'S bring|ing the Heavens &amp; Earth into that beauteous &amp; u&s;e|ful <HI>Order</HI> which we behold, out of a <HI>Chaos</HI> and State of Confu&s;ion? Gen. 1.2. <HI>And the Earth was with|out form and void, and Darkne&s;s was upon the face of it: And the SPIRIT of GOD moved upon the face of the Waters: And GOD &s;aid, Let there be Light, and there was Light: &mdash; And GOD divi|ded the Light from the Darkne&s;s, and GOD called the light Day, and the darkne&s;s He called Night: And GOD &s;aid, Let there be a Firmament,</HI> &amp; <HI>Lights</HI> therein, <HI>and let</HI> them <HI>be for &s;igns, and for &s;ea&s;ons, and for Dayes and for Years.</HI> Thus ORDER was the glo|rious Work of GOD in the beginning, and by it <HI>all things con&s;i&s;t:</HI> the Sun &amp; Moon &amp; Stars, in their various Di&s;t|ances, Magnitude, Motions, Influences and Benefits, are bright and &s;hining In&s;tances of glorious Order. <HI>Their Line is gone thro' all the Earth, and their Words to the End of the World.</HI></P>
<P>AMONG <HI>Men</HI> on Earth, GOD has appointed <HI>Rule and Order,</HI> and made them nece&s;&s;ary to our comfort and &s;afety, in private &amp; in public Society. Family Order is the foundation of our Peace and Welfare, of good Nei'bourhood, of Ju&s;tice and Righteou&s;ne&s;s, of Bro|therly-kindne&s;s and Charity; of civil Government and of joint publick Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>THE whole <HI>Law</HI> of GOD to us is comprehended in this one word <HI>Order;</HI> pre&s;cribing fir&s;t our orderly Sub|jection and Behaviour towards GOD, and then to one another in our &s;everal places and Relations; as Supe|riors, In&s;eriors and Equals.</P>

<P>SEE, &s;ee my <HI>beloved Hearers,</HI> a criminal <HI>Di&s;order</HI> big with the mo&s;t hainous <HI>Guilt,</HI> and tragical <HI>Death!</HI> See the ha&s;ty and cur&s;ed Fruit of criminal <HI>Di&s;orders,</HI> in the <HI>double Murder</HI> of a late hopeful and promi&s;ing <HI>Youth,</HI> who was heretofore of Us, a <HI>Child</HI> of great Expectation; but he went out from us, and ran him|&s;elf into the Paths of the De&s;troyer and an untimely Death.

<P>LET me therefore take this &s;ad Occa&s;ion with a heavy Heart, to warn our Young People in the Name and Fear of GOD, again&s;t bloody &amp; unnatural <HI>DUELS</HI> and all the train of vicious Cour&s;es that lead to it; to a mi&s;erable End here, and to a fiery Hell for ever.</P>
<P><HI>DUELS</HI> are the <HI>Devil</HI> all over, who was <HI>the Murderer from the beginning;</HI> and as they come of him, &s;o they repre&s;ent him to the life, in all his Di&s;|obedience and Enmity to GOD, and in all his Pride, Rage, and bloody Hatred of the life of Man. <HI>Duels</HI> are both kinds of <HI>Murder</HI> united: There's the Murder of a Mans <HI>Self</HI> in it, and the Murder of his <HI>Nei'bour</HI> al|&s;o: And alas! as there is the Murder of the <HI>Body</HI> in

<P><HI>CHILDREN,</HI> Beware of forming your &s;elves into nightly or daily <HI>Tavern-clubs;</HI> or even into &s;uch weekly or monthly Societies, for meeting &amp; &s;pending your Evenings in drinking together and gaming; whether at home or abroad. <HI>It is not for you,</HI> our Sons, <HI>no it is not for you, to drink wine and &s;trong drink; le&s;t you drink and forget the Law &amp; Covenant of the</HI> LORD <HI>your</HI> GOD, and run into every exce&s;s and riot. <HI>Give the &s;trong Drink to him that is ready to peri&s;h, and the wine to them that be of heavy Hearts.</HI></P>

<P>SAY not, <HI>fooli&s;h Child,</HI> There is no &s;uch danger from <HI>us</HI> and <HI>our</HI> Gaming together: Why not as much as there is found to have been in the late <HI>bloody Game</HI> that has put the Town in Mourning? <HI>Leave off Strife,</HI> and &s;o Drinking and Gaming, <HI>before it be medled with;</HI> which is <HI>Solomon</HI>'s advice; meaning <HI>that we never begin</HI> or venture on in &s;uch Cour&s;es, whereof we know not the <HI>End,</HI> and think not the <HI>Tendency</HI> of them.</P>

May the <HI>Blood</HI> of di&s;&s;olute Youths never come upon any of your Hou&s;es, by your indulging them in evil &amp; forbidden Prac|tices, and at forbidden Hours. It calls for a great deal more Virtue, Courage and Prudence, to keep a <HI>Tavern</HI> well, then we are ready to think of.</P>
<P>BUT the Care of <HI>public Hou&s;es</HI> belongs al&s;o to the MAGISTRATES, <HI>Ju&s;tices</HI> &amp; <HI>Officers</HI> in the <HI>Town,</HI> to who&s;e Wi&s;dom and Prudence, Integrity and Fidelity, I commend it in the Fear of GOD. <HI>The Earth and all the Inhabitants of it</HI> would <HI>di&s;&s;olve,</HI> if good <HI>Rulers</HI> did not in their Legi&s;lative and Executive Power, <HI>hold up the Pillars thereof.</HI> Let it &s;trengthen your Hands to know, that you are mini&s;tring to the Honour of GOD and the good <HI>Order</HI> of the World; the common Happine&s;s and Peace of Mankind.</P>
<P>LET the Wicked be <HI>afraid</HI> of the POWER; for <HI>He beareth not the Sword in vain;</HI> but is <HI>the Mini&s;ter of GOD, a Revenger to execute Wrath upon him that doeth Evil.</HI> But let the lovers of Peace and Right and Order reverence and <HI>love</HI> the POWERS which GOD has <HI>ordained; For Rulers are not a Terror to good Works, but to the evil: Do that which is Good and thou &s;halt have prai&s;e of the &s;ame. Wherefore ye mu&s;t needs be &s;ubject, not only for Wrath, but al&s;o for Con&s;cience &s;ake.</HI></P>
