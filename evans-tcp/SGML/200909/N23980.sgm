<HEAD>THE AMERICAN FARMER's GUIDE.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ucce&s;s of Farming depends principally on the collecting manure&mdash;on a proper change of crops, and on good tillage or plough|ing the ground properly to keep it clean; on the choice and manage|ment of &s;tock, and on the care of the orchard and its produce. On the&s;e &s;everal articles I &s;hall make &s;ome notes, which are chiefly col|lected from Mr. Young's Farmer's tour through England, publi&s;hed in 1771.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="4" REF="031718_0003_0FEE1A4ADE4DFAF8">
<HEAD>Means for collecting manure, and ma|nagement of a farm-yard.</HEAD>
<P>Let the farm-yard be made tole|bly large, around it let there be &s;heds or &s;helter for cattle. The yard &s;hould be level, or rather hollow in the middle, that the ooze may not run off. Into this yard throw all your &s;traw, which is not u&s;ed for bedding. But as this will not be &s;ufficient, it will be well to mow &s;tubble, which is cut high, and cart it in the yard. All the rubbi&s;h and weeds in the lanes, &amp;c. which &s;hould be cut while green before they go to &s;eed, &s;hould likewi&s;e be carted in. But above all, rake together the leaves in the woods, which may be loaded into carts with large ba&s;|kets, and carry them into the yard. The&s;e being &s;pread over the yard, will by the cattle's treading on them, and receiving their dung and urine all winter, be converted in|to as rich a manure as any in the world.</P>
<P>When cattle are hou&s;ed, they &s;hould be bedded every night with
<PB N="5" REF="031718_0004_0FEE1A4E3A2BAD88">&s;traw or leaves up to their bellies. This contributes to their health and encrea&s;es the dung. Let their &s;tall be clean&s;ed out once a week, The heat of their bodies lying on the litter for that time will begin to promote a fermentation, by which it will be reduced to a good manure. By this mean, for every hor&s;e or cow kept in a &s;table during the winter, you may make at lea&s;t fif|teen or &s;ixteen large loads of dung. This dung &s;hould, in the &s;pring, be carted out to a &s;tercorary, which &s;hould be prepared in the following manner: Fir&s;t, &s;pread a layer of earth (the clean&s;ing of ditches or earth &s;craped from the &s;urface of the ground will an&s;wer for this) then throw on a thick layer of dung, and then a layer of earth, and &s;o alternately a layer of dung and a layer of earth, but &s;o that the quantity of earth &s;hall not ex|ceed one half the quantity of dung. By this mean you will have 23 or 24 loads of good manure for every bea&s;t, and this laid on in the fall will be a good dre&s;&s;ing for an acre of land.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="031718_0005_0FEE1A519CBF6BB8">
In making the &s;tercorary, the carts &s;hould not drive on the heap, as this would pre&s;s it too much and pre|vent the fermentation, which is nece&s;&s;ary to render it good compo&s;t. The loads may be &s;hot down by the heap and thrown on with &s;hovels, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Great care &s;hould be taken to pre|&s;erve the urine and ooze from the yard and &s;tercorary. For this pur|po&s;e &s;ome careful farmers &s;ink wells, the bottom and &s;ides of which are well clayed. To the&s;e the ooze is conducted, and when they are full, &s;ome pump it up and throw it back upon the heap; others cart it out and &s;prinkle it over the gra&s;s. This la&s;t is &s;aid to be an excellent prac|tice.</P>
<P>There is another practice which turns to great account, as well for increa&s;ing the quantity of manure as for feeding hor&s;es and cattle in the cheape&s;t manner; let a field of red clover be &s;owed near the farm|yard; in the &s;econd year after it is &s;own it will be fit for cutting in the &s;econd week in May. Let the hor|&s;es
<PB N="7" REF="031718_0006_0FEE1A5549BC4388">and cattle be then kept in the yard, and clover cut and given to them in the &s;table or in racks. It has been found by experience that 7 acres of clover will feed 20 hor|&s;es, 7 cows, 5 calves, and as many pigs, for 17 weeks. Suppo&s;e the rate of keeping to be as follows:

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>It will be nece&s;&s;ary here to ob&s;erve, that this calculation is made in Penn&s;ylvania, where the prices and currency may differ materially from tho&s;e of other places; the reader mu&s;t therefore make his calculation according to the cu&s;toms by which he is mo&s;t liable to be regulated.</HI></NOTE> Be|&s;ides this, the quantity of dung is immen&s;e where there is litter at command; and this is always the ca&s;e where leaves can be gathered
<PB N="8" REF="031718_0007_0FEE1A58E10381F0">from the woods; for cattle fed on green food make much more urine in the &s;ummer. It has been e&s;ti|mated that four or five hundred loads of good dung may be made in the time mentioned from the above hor&s;es and cattle. This, mixed with earth as before directed, will produce upwards of 600 loads of manure, which would be a pretty good dre&s;&s;ing for thirty acres of land.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved that a careful farmer &s;uffers nothing to go to wa&s;te; and therefore all the urine and of|fals from the hou&s;e, and all the or|dure from the nece&s;&s;ary are carried and thrown on the &s;tercorary or farm-yard.</P>
<P>In preparing a place for the &s;ter|corery, it may not be ami&s;s fir&s;t to dig out the earth about two or three feet deep. In that ca&s;e the bottom &s;hould be well rammed and clayed, to prevent the ooze from &s;inking into the earth. The earth that is dug out, if of a loomy quality or &s;andy mixed with loom, will &s;erve to mix with the dung; &s;o that the
<PB N="9" REF="031718_0008_0FEE1A5A6BA5A908">labour of digging the pit will not be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>In order to mix the earth and dung well together, the &s;tercorary &s;hould be turned at lea&s;t once in the &s;ummer. For this purpo&s;e a &s;mall &s;pace &s;hould be left at one end, then beginning at that end throw an e|qual &s;pace of the compo&s;t from top to bottom into that empty &s;pace, and &s;o proceed till the whole is well turned and mixed. The &s;ter|corary &s;hould be kept moi&s;t, but not too wet; for though a moderate degree of moi&s;ture promotes fer|mentation and putrefaction, too great a degree will prevent them. As our &s;ummer &s;un is very warm, and exhales too much of the moi&s;t|ure, it will be well to cover the &s;tercorary with hurdles or leavy branches, or a thatched cover may be made over it.</P>

<HEAD>2 <HI>The change and cour&s;e of crops.</HI></HEAD>
<P>It is a common opinion and prac|tice in this country, that land &s;hould yield a crop only once in three
<PB N="10" REF="031718_0009_0FEE1A61B2700878">years: this &s;urely is bad farming, and what nothing but the great quantity of land could warrant. In England and throughout Europe, and indeed in all old &s;ettled coun|tries, where land is &s;carce and rents high, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that a crop of &s;ome &s;ort be rai&s;ed from the ground every year. And expe|rience has evinced that land will bear this, and that the goodne&s;s of the crop depends upon culture and manure, and a proper change of &s;eeds. For though good lands are of great importance, yet the &s;kill and indu&s;try of the farmer, will, in a great degree, compen&s;ate for the want of goodne&s;s in the &s;oil in its natural &s;tate; and it is found that by proper management, lands which are naturally poor have been bro't to yield crops nearly as great as rich lands, and much greater than rich lands ill managed. The man therefore to who&s;e lot it has fallen to po&s;&s;e&s;s lands naturally poor &s;hould not be di&s;couraged, but rather &s;tim|ulated to exert his abilities and &s;hew his &s;kill in meliorating nature.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="031718_0010_0FEE1A6340554BF0">
A &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame fort of crops will &s;peedily exhau&s;t the be&s;t land. For this rea&s;on the &s;kilful farmer changes his crops almo&s;t e|very year. The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion mo&s;t approved, and which is practi&s;ed to great advantage in Norfolk, one of the be&s;t farming counties in Eng|land, is;
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 Turnips,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 Barley with clover &s;eed,</ITEM>
<ITEM>3 Clover,</ITEM>
<ITEM>4 Wheat;</ITEM>
</LIST> Then turnips, &amp;c. in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion a|gain. Some have had the third and fourth year clover, and the fifth wheat.</P>
<P>Another cour&s;e, which they find extremely beneficial, is,

<ITEM>1 Turnips,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 Barley,</ITEM>
<ITEM>3 Clover, two years,</ITEM>
<ITEM>4 Buckwheat,</ITEM>
<ITEM>5 Wheat; then turnips, &amp;c. a|gain.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>They plough four or five times for turnips, beginning in the fall. After the &s;econd ploughing they leave the ground unharrowed to
<PB N="12" REF="031718_0011_0FEE1A64C9A95BB0">receive the benefit of the winter fro&s;ts. They plough it again in the &s;pring, having fir&s;t laid on the ma|nure; then they plough and harrow it again in May, and give it the la&s;t ploughing and harrowing in June, when the &s;eed is &s;own.</P>
<P>Some put on their manure ju&s;t before the la&s;t ploughing. With re&s;pect to this experience will be the be&s;t director. The turnips &s;hould be &s;own in rows, or the &s;eed drilled with a drill plough. The turnips, while growing, &s;hould be hoed twice, or ploughed between the rows, as it is common for pota|toes, and kept clear of weeds.</P>
<P>The crop is fed off with cattle and &s;heep. Some feed them off as they grow, confining the cattle and &s;heep by hurdles to an acre, and when that is eaten up, removing the hurdles, and taking in another acre till the whole is fed off. O|thers pur&s;ue the following method: they fir&s;t feed one piece, &s;uppo&s;e an acre, by running a row of hurdles acro&s;s the field; then, before they move the hurdles, they draw ano|ther
<PB N="13" REF="031718_0012_0FEE1A6BD36587C8">acre, and cart them for the cattle to the acre eating off, and &s;o on through the field, always cart the crop from the land where it grows to the part la&s;t cleared. If the produce is large, and cattle turned in, they &s;poil as much as they eat, but when turnips are laid clear above the &s;oil, and the earth partly &s;haken off, they eat them up clean.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>A method practi&s;ed to de&s;troy the turnip fly.</HEAD>
<P>Collect all &s;orts of weeds, mix them with &s;traw, and lay them in heaps on the windward &s;ide of the field. Then &s;et them on &s;ire, &s;o that the wind may blow the &s;moke over the whole field. This drives away the fly at once and &s;aves the crop. But it &s;hould be ob&s;erved that the weeds mu&s;t not be wither|ed too much, as it is the &s;mother|ing flame that produces the &s;moke, which is expected to have the de&s;i|red effect.</P>
<P>For barley they commonly plow
<PB N="14" REF="031718_0013_0FEE1A6D5B732150">three times, but &s;ome four times, twice in the fall, leaving the la&s;t ploughing unharrowed to receive the benefit of the winter fro&s;ts, the other ploughing or ploughings they give in the winter or &s;pring. With us, as our winters are generally &s;e|vere, three, or even two ploughings will do; one or two in the fall &amp; one in the &s;pring. They &s;ow four bu&s;hels of &s;eed to the acre, and get from thirty-two to forty bu&s;hels in return. This &s;eems a large quan|tity of &s;eed. However, experience will &s;hew, whether the quantity commonly &s;own in this country, which is u&s;ually not more than two bu&s;hels, or that &s;own in Norfolk is be&s;t. And for this purpo&s;e, it will be well to try different quantities on the &s;ame field, and note the dif|ference, and then follow that which an&s;wers be&s;t.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Clover.</HEAD>
<P>After the barley is &s;own and har|rowed, they then &s;ow the clover &s;eed, eight or ten pounds of &s;eed to
<PB N="15" REF="031718_0014_0FEE1A6EE584EB60">the acre, and then roll the ground with a large wooden roller, which pre&s;&s;es in the &s;eed and breaks the clods. In this country &s;ome defer &s;owing the clover till the barley is off. The land is then ploughed and well harrowed, and &s;own with clover &s;eed, eight or ten pounds to the acre, and then rolled. Some recommend the &s;owing buckwheat before the la&s;t harrowing, and then to &s;ow and roll in the clover &s;eed. The buckwheat, they ob&s;erve, &s;hel|ters the young clover from the &s;un, and keeps down weeds and other gra&s;s. But in this ca&s;e the buck|wheat &s;hould be &s;own very thin. The mowing or cutting it in the fall will not injure the clover. Both ways may be tried.</P>
<P>The year following they mow the fir&s;t crop of clover, and feed the &s;econd. The crop of hay is gene|rally two tons to an acre, &s;ometimes three. I am inclined to think it will be be&s;t to mow both crops, and if feed is wanting for the cattle in the beginning of &s;ummer, it would be be&s;t to cut it, and give it them
<PB N="16" REF="031718_0015_0FEE1A706EE74748">green in the farm yard or &s;tables, as before mentioned. If the after crop is rank, it may be fed in the fall; and if it is kept for a clover crop the next year, it &s;hould be co|vered in the beginning of the win|ter with a light coat of long dung, about ten or twelve large loads to the acre, to pre&s;erve the roots from the fro&s;t. The next year, &s;ome mow twice, &s;ome only once, and turn in the &s;econd crop as a manure for wheat.</P>
<P>Clover &s;hould be cut for hay be|fore the &s;eed is ripe, ju&s;t when it &s;eems to be in full blo&s;&s;om; and in making the hay great care &s;hould be taken not to expo&s;e it too much to the &s;un.</P>
<P>In curing clover, it is recom|mended by &s;ome as the be&s;t way to let it lay a &s;hort time in the &s;warth, then ju&s;t turn over the &s;warths, and thus backwards and forwards, with|out expo&s;ing it long at any time to the &s;un, and without &s;preading it abroad, by which means the leaves will be welted and adhere firmly to the &s;talk; whereas, by expo&s;ing them to the warm &s;un, the leaves
<PB N="17" REF="031718_0016_0FEE1A793A7FB928">are &s;hrivelled and drop from the &s;talk, and thereby the riche&s;t part is lo&s;t.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Hay-making.</HEAD>
<P>In an&s;wer to &s;ome enquiries I made of Col. G. M. re&s;pecting his prac|tice of making hay, I received the following letter: "I make a point of mowing only when the weather promi&s;es, with a degree of certain|ty, it will be fair, afternoon gu&s;ts excepted, which, in our climate, cannot be guarded again&s;t only by my proce&s;s. I then &s;et my mowers at work as &s;oon as I can get them at it. They continue to cut until ten o'clock. At nine o'clock I turn my hor&s;es and cattle out of the ploughs, and after the ploughmen have taken their breakfa&s;t, I &s;et them and the mowers to raking my gra&s;s from the &s;warth into winrows, beginning at the gra&s;s la&s;t cut, and proceeding on until they have ga|thered into winrows all the &s;warths which were cut the preceding part of the day. The&s;e winrows are
<PB N="18" REF="031718_0017_0FEE1A7AC7B56768">then made into what we call gra&s;s|cocks. This being done, the mow|ers proceed in cutting, and the ra|kers follow and gather and cock af|ter them as fa&s;t as they cut until night. When I do not choo&s;e to take my ploughmen off, and have not other hands, my mowers cut till 11 o'clock, by which time each has cut an acre or more. The mow|ers then proceed to rake and cock, beginning with the gra&s;s la&s;t cut, and fini&s;hing with that fir&s;t mow|ed in the morning. If I &s;ee clouds ari&s;e in the afternoon, I di&s;patch hands &s;ufficient to a&s;&s;i&s;t and get all into cock before the rain comes on. When it continues fair all day, a mower can cut about as much gra&s;s by eleven or twelve o'clock, as he can conveniently rake and cock be|fore &s;un-&s;et. Thus my mowing and making my hay co&s;ts me about 5<ABBR>&s;.</ABBR> or 5.<ABBR>&s;</ABBR> 6. per. acre; for that is the price I give per day to a good workman, who finds him&s;elf in vic|tuals and liquor, and who will ne|ver cut le&s;s than an acre by eleven o'clock, provided he is not to con|tinue it the &s;ucceeding part of the
<PB N="19" REF="031718_0018_0FEE1A7C50F297B0">day. I &s;ay the mowing, making, and cocking co&s;t me 5<ABBR>&s;.</ABBR> or 5<ABBR>&s;.</ABBR> 6<ABBR>d.</ABBR> per acre, becau&s;e I never open the&s;e cocks till I hou&s;e or &s;tack my hay; for if even repeated and continual rains &s;hould fall, while it is in cock, the water never penetrates farther than the &s;un or wind will immedi|ately dry. This mode of making hay pre&s;erves it (all except the out|er &s;ide of each blade expo&s;ed to the &s;un) of a green colour, and prevents the evaporation of the rich juices of the gra&s;s, which are pre&s;erved in the highe&s;t perfection. I have practi&s;ed this method &s;ix &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ea&s;ons with my common meadow gra&s;s, and having fallen into the very beneficial practice of &s;owing twenty acres of clover every year, I have cured all my clover hay in this method; and you may depend upon it to be the be&s;t as well as the cheape&s;t. All the caution nece&s;&s;a|ry to be u&s;ed in this manner of ma|king hay is, that the gra&s;s be dry when fir&s;t put into cock; by this I mean dry from dew or rain. In the u&s;ual manner of making clover into hay, the leaves become of a
<PB N="20" REF="031718_0019_0FED37DE3B8AFF08">dark tobacco colour, and part from the &s;talks on the very &s;lighte&s;t touch, &s;o that you hou&s;e very few of them. But by this method the whole are pre&s;erved of an olive green, and the &s;talks are &s;oft and pliable and contain great nutriment. In regard to the time your hay mu&s;t continue out in cocks before it be hou&s;ed, that mu&s;t depend on the weather, and your judgment of its &s;tate. Having no fear of its being injured by continuing too long in the field, I leave mine out from one to three weeks, never hurrying my|&s;elf from other nece&s;&s;ary work at this bu&s;y &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>Some put up their clover when it &s;eems to be but half cured, but to pre&s;erve it from heating in the mow they u&s;e this precaution: they have a quantity of &s;traw ready pre|pared; they then fir&s;t lay down a layer of &s;traw, and a layer of hay upon that, and &s;o alternately: Some u&s;e a farther precaution: When they put up their hay in barracks, they leave a &s;pace at the bottom be|tween the ground and the hay:
<PB N="21" REF="031718_0020_0FEE1A86B9D75B98">they have then bags filled with hay, one or more, as they judge nece&s;&s;a|ry, according to the largene&s;s of the barrack and the &s;tate of the gra&s;s. The&s;e bags they &s;et up an end on the floor, and then throw in the hay and &s;traw alternately as above, treading them down and drawing up the bags as the rick ri|&s;es, and thus vent holes are made for the air to pa&s;s through the mid|dle of the hay from bottom to top, which cools it and prevents it from heating. By the&s;e means the dry &s;traw &s;oaks up the &s;uperfluous moi&s;ture of the hay, and becomes &s;o impregnated with the juices of the clover, that the whole is eaten up clean by both hor&s;es and cattle. This practice of intermixing &s;traw with clover is recommended on an|other account: The mixture of &s;traw prevents the bad effects of clover, which, when eaten by it&s;elf is apt to hove cattle. And it is worthy of ob&s;ervation, that when cattle are fed in a yard, if there are racks of &s;traw therein, as well as clover, the cattle will of their own
<PB N="22" REF="031718_0021_0FEE1A8846A0E258">accord go from the clover to the &s;traw, and then to the clover, and &s;o backwards and forwards alternately. And hence it appears to be proper, if &s;traw be not mixed with clover in the rick, that a portion of it &s;hould be given to the cattle along with the clo|ver.</P>
<P>If the &s;econd crop of clover is ploughed in, it will an&s;wer as a ma|nure for wheat; but if the &s;econd crop is cut, then it will be proper to lay on a coat of compo&s;t from the &s;ter|corary, from ten to twenty large loads to an acre, as you have it to &s;pare. Plough it in, and &s;ow the wheat.

<PB N="23" REF="031718_0022_0FEE1A89CEFF14B0">it, and is made with &s;uch a number of drills, that with it one man can &s;ow five or &s;ix acres a day or more.

<P>After the wheat is reaped, it is a common practice with the Norfolk farmers to harrow the &s;tubble and cart it home to the farm yard. If the wheat be cradled there will be le&s;s &s;tubble left on the field; but &s;till it will be worth while to harrow and cart home what can be collected. Af|ter this they proceed in the culture of the land for turnips next year, and in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of crops, as above men|tioned, without ever &s;uffering the land to lie idle.</P>

<HEAD>Indian Corn.</HEAD>
<P>As the culture of turnips is not com|mon, at lea&s;t to &s;uch a degree in this country as in England, I am inclined to think Indian corn may be &s;ub&s;titut|ed
<PB N="24" REF="031718_0023_0FEE1A8B57E91800">to good advantage in place of tur|nips; and as we have not yet found marle for manuring our lands, though I have no doubt there is plenty of it if &s;ought for, but till it be found, lime, where it can be got conveniently, may be u&s;ed in&s;tead of marle. In this cul|ture I would recommend the plough|ing up the field in the fall. Then lay on about forty bu&s;hels of un&s;lack|ed lime fre&s;h from the kiln to every acre. Various methods are u&s;ed in laying on the lime: &s;ome put it in heaps, and when it is &s;lacked, they mix it with earth, and cart out the mixture and &s;pread it over the land. Some &s;hoot down a load of forty bu&s;h|els on each acre, there let it &s;lack, mix it when &s;lacked with &s;ome earth, and carry it out and &s;pread it over the ground. Others divide the load into &s;mall heaps on the ground, and as &s;oon as it &s;lacks, &s;pread it with a &s;hovel without any mixture of earth, taking care to &s;crape up the ground under the heap. They then harrow the ground to mix and cover the lime: which of the&s;e methods is be&s;t I cannot deter|mine, not having had &s;ufficient expe|rience.
<PB N="25" REF="031718_0024_0FEE1A9445B2C938">Different experiments may be made, which is the only mode of acquiring knowledge in this bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>In the &s;pring, plough and harrow the ground, and when it is time to plant, furrow out the ground, cro&s;&s;ing it at right angels with deep furrows for planting: the furrows &s;hould be &s;trait and equidi&s;tant. The breadth of the intervals between the furrows or rows, will depend upon the good|ne&s;s of the &s;oil. When the ground is furrowed out, drop two or three grains at every inter&s;ection of the fur|rows, and cover them with a hoe. If a &s;hovel full of good dung is mixed with earth and put into each inter&s;ec|tion where the corn is planted, the goodne&s;s of the crop would largely pay the expence. Then plough and harrow it as u&s;ual till the corn begins to ta&s;&s;el, always keeping the ground loo&s;e, and clear from weeds and gra&s;s. But after it ta&s;&s;els, and the &s;ilk begins to appear, it &s;hould be left to it&s;elf. Meddling with it at that time is hurt|ful. And if it has had a good fall and &s;pring ploughing, been limed and well tended till that time, the weeds after|wards
<PB N="26" REF="031718_0025_0FEE1A95CF37DFC0">will not come to any great height, at lea&s;t not to injure the crop. When the corn is ripe, plough the ground down from the rows into the furrows or middle, leaving the corn &s;tanding to dry, the blades of the &s;talks being &s;tripped off, and the tops cut and carried home. After the corn is pulled, the &s;talks may be cut down and the ridge ploughed up. And thus the ground may be left the en&s;uing winter either for barley or clover &s;eed, or for potatoes, which is a crop that de&s;erves the attention of the farmer, either for the market or for feeding.</P>
<P>There is another method of prepa|ring the ground for planting Indian corn, which I am inclined to prefer to that ju&s;t mentioned. It is to be ob|&s;erved that corn does not &s;trike a deep root, but draws its nutriment from the upper coat of earth. For this cau&s;e it is common to make hills with hoes round the root of the &s;talks, but as this requires much labour, I would recommend the ploughing the land in the &s;pring, into ridges of the width of the intended intervals between the rows, making the fir&s;t furrow pretty
<PB N="27" REF="031718_0026_0FEE1A97584151F0">deep; then cro&s;s the ridges with a deep &s;urrow, and at the inter&s;ection of the ridge and cro&s;s furrows, plant the &s;eed, and as the corn &s;prings up, plow down the ridges into the fur|rows, and harrow the ground to keep it clear of weeds. By this method the corn will have plenty of rich loo&s;e mould for &s;upplying it with nouri&s;h|ment without much trouble of hoeing.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Potatoes.</HEAD>
<P>If potatoes are fixed on to follow the corn, I would recommend plough|ing the ground in April, pretty deep, into ridges of three and an half feet wide. Dung the furrow with about 14 or 15 loads of yard dung to an acre; then plant the potatoes on the dung, one row in a furrow, and one foot a&s;under. Some recommend the lay|ing the potatoes on the earth, aad the dung over them, and as the beginning of our &s;ummers are u&s;ually dry and warm, I am inclined to believe this is the be&s;t method. However, in this, as has been already ob&s;erved, experi|ence will be the be&s;t guide. Then
<PB N="28" REF="031718_0027_0FEE1A9E5DC98CA0">cover them with a plough from each fide. When the &s;hoots appear a few inches above the ground, plough down the land to them, and repeat the ploughing till the center of the ridges becomes a furrow. Some, after this, give them one hand hoeing, drawing up the earth clo&s;e to the &s;talks; but this is condemned by others, who &s;ay that the centre of the ridge &s;hould be kept low to retain the moi&s;ture and rain, and prevent its running off. If in ploughing between the rows, a plough was u&s;ed with a double mould|board, to throw the earth on both &s;ides, the furrow in the middle might be &s;unk deeper, and the earth thrown up to the &s;talks without injuring the roots. In October they are dug up with prongs. This operation may be ren|dered ea&s;y by cutting down the ridg|es on both &s;ides into the furrows with a plough.</P>
<P>When the potatoes are gathered they &s;hould be &s;pread to dry, and when dry, then &s;tored away till they be car|ried to market or u&s;ed at home. They are found to be an excellent food for cattle and hogs; cows will eat them
<PB N="29" REF="031718_0028_0FEE1A9FE56161B8">raw greedily; hogs will fatten well on them boiled and mar&s;hed with a little barley meal or Indian corn meal mix|ed.

The time for planting is the end of April, but they will do in May, or even the fir&s;t week in June. Next &s;pring &s;ow barley or clover &s;eed as before mentioned, fir&s;t giving the ground one good ploughing, then &s;ow|ing the barley and rolling in the clo|ver &s;eed as before directed.

The clover may re|main two years, then follow it wtth wheat on one ploughing.</P>
<P>After this, &s;ome let the land lie &s;al|low one year; but if this be adopted, it will be be&s;t to plough in the &s;tub|ble,
<PB N="30" REF="031718_0029_0FEE1AA16E7B0C40">and &s;ow early in the &s;pring about one half the u&s;ual quantity of rye. This will afford fine pa&s;ture in the &s;pring and &s;ummer.

<P>If at all adventures oats mu&s;t be rai&s;ed, I would recommend a prac|tice, which, I am told, has been fol|lowed by &s;ome farmers to advan|tage: They choo&s;e out a piece of ground, no matter though of indif|ferent quality, &s;o it be convenient to the hou&s;e; they fir&s;t plough it up in the fall, and lime it with about forty bu&s;hels of un&s;lacked lime to the acre; in the &s;pring, they plough it again and &s;ow it with oats: as &s;oon as the oats are cut and gather|ed in, they plough in the &s;tubble, harrow the ground and &s;hut up the field. The oats &s;cattered in reaping or cradling &s;pring up and yield a good fall pa&s;ture for milch cows. Next &s;pring it is &s;own again with oats, and treated in the &s;ame man|ner, and &s;o from year to year. I was told by a farmer that he had &s;ixteen crops of oats &s;ucce&s;&s;ively

<P>In the la&s;t week of May dig holes at the inter&s;ections of the furrows,
<PB N="35" REF="031718_0034_0FEE1AB26796D3A0">and throw into each two or three &s;hovels full of dung, mixing it well with a parcle of the mould dug out of the holes. About the 10th of June, mix again the dung and mould in the holes and plant the &s;eed. The yellow fle&s;hed round pump|kins or the flat ribbed &s;ort are reck|oned the be&s;t. After the &s;eed is planted, plough up the ground be|tween and harrow it; and while the plants are growing, plough and harrow the ground as often as is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to keep it loo&s;e and clear of weeds, always hand-hoeing round the plants. It is the practice of &s;ome to make up hills and plant the &s;eed in the hills: this may be pro|per in England, from whence I pre|&s;ume the practice has been brought, where the &s;ummer &s;un is weak and faint; but it is certainly improper in this country under our &s;corching &s;uns, and where the &s;ummers are commonly dry; and therefore the holes, when the dung and mould are mixed in them for planting &s;hould be &s;omewhat lower than the &s;urface of the adjoining ground.

<P>Potatoes boiled and mixed with rye or barley meal in the proportion of one or two bu&s;hels to twenty, fatten large hogs better than corn alone. In the proportion of one to forty, they fatten porkers, and half fatten bacon hogs. One third barley meal, and two thirds pota|toes boiled, are found to exceed peas or barley alone in fattening hogs; but what is more material, experience has proved, that being boiled and given alone, they will fatten porkers as well as po&s;&s;ible. Feeding cows with them has like|wi&s;e been tried, and found to an&s;wer well, and the milk and butter have proved exceedingly good. But it is to be ob&s;erved that it is bad man|agement to give cows in winter a food which will an&s;wer for fatten|ing any animal; and therefore the grand object of potatoe culture ought to be the fattening of hogs, for which u&s;e experience has proved

This is a native of Italy or the hilly country border|ing on the Alps: it is now much cultivated in France, and of late years has been introduced into En|gland: and from all accounts, it appears as if it would an&s;wer well in this country. It &s;trikes a deep root, grows on poor &s;oils, and yields a large crop. Even when &s;own on the tops of hills, and on &s;tony or gravelly ground, it is &s;aid that it will yield, on an average, two tons an acre, and a good fall pa&s;ture. It is &s;own broad ca&s;t among oats or o|ther &s;pring grain, in the &s;ame way as clover, and will la&s;t from fifteen to twenty years. Any &s;oil will do for it if free from &s;prings and &s;tag|nant water. When it grows wee|dy it is harrowed till the ground has the appearance of a fallow. This de&s;troys the weeds and natural gra&s;|&s;es without injuring the &s;ainfoine, and adds to its duration. If one half of what is &s;aid of it be true, it certainly will de&s;erve the attenti|on of our farmers. The &s;eed may be imported from France or England. The u&s;ual time of &s;owing it is in

<P>There are &s;everal other artificial gra&s;&s;es, &s;uch as burnet, luzerne, &amp;c. which are highly recommended, but I have &s;ome doubt, notwith&s;tand|ing what is &s;aid of them, whether, upon a fair experiment, they will be found to excel our blue gra&s;s and white clover, or our red clover. Sainfoine, indeed, according to what is &s;aid of it, has this in its favour, that it will thrive and yield a good crop even on poor &s;oils, may be &s;own with grain, and will la&s;t for many years. Its culture is cheap and &s;imple, and when it begins to fail it may be &s;oon renewed. But after all, the culture of clover de|&s;erves the particular attention of the farmer, and will be found to be one great pillar of good hu&s;bandry.

<PB N="45" REF="031718_0044_0FEE1AD6070F01C0">&s;carcely any failure; which will, the year after it is &s;own, yield from three to four tons of hay from an a|cre, and oftentimes more at two mow|ings; which will la&s;t one or perhaps two years longer, if it &s;uits the far|mer, and which is a better prepa|ration for wheat than the fine&s;t fal|low, requiring at the &s;ame time but one ploughing before the wheat is &s;owed. All the&s;e circum&s;tances u|nite to render clover an object of high importance and well de&s;erving the attention of a farmer. The ad|vantage will appear &s;till greater, when it is con&s;idered that the crop may be all, and u&s;ually is, con&s;umed by cattle at home. Hence the farmer is enabled to keep great &s;tocks of cattle on &s;oils where he could not otherwi&s;e have any, and thereby rai&s;e much dung, and keep his land in good heart.</P>
<P>Hitherto I have directed the at|tention of the farmers almo&s;t alto|gether to the collecting and making manure from his &s;tock. This is the more nece&s;&s;ary as other kinds of manure, &s;uch as marle lime, &amp;c.

<HEAD>Liming land.</HEAD>
<P>As the &s;ubject of liming land is of importance, I will here in&s;ert the ob&s;ervations and practice of a friend of mine in the u&s;e of lime for ma|nure, which he was &s;o obliging as to communicate to me as follows:</P>
<P>"I have in the cour&s;e of &s;even years, put on as many thou&s;and bu&s;hels of lime in a great variety of modes. With re&s;pect to farming for wheat, rye or corn, every one takes his own method. It is impo&s;|&s;ible to form a general rule to &s;uit all &s;oils. The method mu&s;t depend on the quality of your land. If the land be much worn out it will take the le&s;s quantity of lime. The &s;oil be&s;t adapted to lime is a loomy ground inclining to &s;and, at lea&s;t I have found it to an&s;wer be&s;t, tho'
<PB N="47" REF="031718_0046_0FEE1ADAF7D4E860">I have heard of great things being done with lime on clay. Deep ploughing, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, ought to be practi&s;ed, but &s;hallow ploughing after the lime is laid on. Lime evaporates, but it has a great|er inclination to &s;ink into the earth. Mixing it well by frequent harrow|ing is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. You may put on a greater quantity if you plough deep; but do not be in ha&s;te for your profit the fir&s;t year as the cultivation requires frequent ploughing and tending. Rye will an&s;wer the fir&s;t year; but wheat will come to nothing, as the crops on the limed lands are late, and the mildews with us operate mo&s;t on late crops. I generally begin with forty bu&s;hels of un&s;lacked lime per acre, and put on the &s;ame quantity every third year. This you may continue to do until you find your land in &s;ufficient heart. I have never exceeded 120 bu&s;hels on an acre, put on as before de&s;cribed. My land would not average with|out lime above eight bu&s;hels of wheat an acre, and when I had
<PB N="48" REF="031718_0047_0FED37E00066C498">limed it &s;ufficiently, I have had in &s;ome in&s;tances twenty-five and on an average twenty bu&s;hels per acre. The be&s;t time for putting on lime is in the autumn; after ploughing deep, put on your lime, harrow it in and let the ground lie fallow through the winter. There is no advantage in letting your ground lie idle, as the lime wa&s;ts as well without as with a crop. If you chu&s;e to turn ground into gra&s;s, the be&s;t way I have found is, after ta|king off three crops of grain, to &s;ow buckwheat with the gra&s;s &s;eed after harve&s;t. Let it lie three years in clover, which of it&s;elf meliorates the land; you may then plough it, and proceed with the u&s;ual cultiva|tion for grain, putting on lime as be|fore. I have &s;ucce&s;sfully plouged clover in when it was in full blo&s;|&s;om: This is a great nanure, and your crop overpays for the lo&s;s of the gra&s;s. I have found great bene|fit in &s;prinkling a pint of &s;lacked lime on every hill of Indian corn ju&s;t after it is planted.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="031718_0048_0FEE1AE22ED25BD0">
On this I would ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that, had my friend attended to the true cour&s;e of crops, he would have expe|rienced much greater advantage from his lime. The taking three crops of grain; or even two crops, after Indi|an corn, mu&s;t foul the land and ex|hau&s;t it too much.</P>
<P>There is another manure for gra&s;s, which has of late been highly extoll|ed, I mean gyp&s;e or plai&s;ter of Paris, powdered fine and &s;cattered over the ground, about three or four bu&s;hels to the acre. The &s;tone u&s;ed about Phi|ladelphia has been brought from No|va Scotia or Cape Breton. I am told there is a vein of it found in Bucks County in Penn&s;ylvania, and another near Patuxent in Maryland. I wi&s;h further experiments to be made with this manure. I have had &s;ome made on light gravelly &s;oils and on dry loa|my ground, which produced amazing effects.</P>
<P>Having been informed that my friend, who&s;e letter I have quoted a|bove on the &s;ubject of lime, had made &s;ome experiments with gyp&s;e, which had exceeded his mo&s;t &s;anguine ex|pectation,
<PB N="50" REF="031718_0049_0FEE1AE3B6827F90">I wrote to him and reque&s;t|ed him to communicate to me his ex|periments, and, at the &s;ame time con|&s;ulted him about taking one of my farms into my own management: his an&s;wer contained the following re|marks.</P>
<P>"If you are &s;erious about your farm, &s;et &s;omebody at work directly to clear your water cour&s;es on your meadow: mend your dams, and get &s;omebody to look after them and the water cour&s;es this winter: (his letter was dated the 8th of November.) One week of the winter water, is better than a month in &s;ummer. Try a few bu&s;hels of lime on your meadow. I &s;pread above twenty bu&s;hels to the acre la&s;t fall, and had good &s;ucce&s;s. I did this becau&s;e I could get no plai&s;|ter of Paris that was good. I am a devotee to the gyp&s;e upon my gra&s;s; my experience this way is of long &s;tanding; but as to grain, I never tri|ed it till this year. I put on my In|dian corn a &s;mall quantity, one large handful to four hills, and I think it produced a wonderful effect. About four bu&s;hels manured nine acres of
<PB N="51" REF="031718_0050_0FEE1AE543AD5090">corn. The whole of my field was li|med; but I left &s;ome rows without the gyp&s;e. And though the corn is all good, there is a very perceptible dif|ference. In the &s;ummer the gyp&s;ed corn was of a deeper green, and now the cars are much the large&s;t. I al&s;o put &s;ome on a field adjoining, where the land was very poor, and had nei|ther been dunged nor limed. The effect is the &s;ame comparatively with the other corn in this field, but not equal to the limed field. I tried a &s;mall quantity on buckwheat, and I think I &s;aw a difference much to the advantage of the gyp&s;e in this experi|ment. As to gra&s;s, I am convinced of its effects&mdash;I never tried it in vain. I have put only four bu&s;hels to the acre, and that in the &s;pring, about the middle of March. It will not do for wet or &s;our land: it is be&s;t to &s;catter or &s;ow it in calm drizly weather.</P>

<HEAD>4th, <HI>The choice and management of Stock.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A choice of the breed of hor&s;es, cattle, &s;heep, and hogs, which is too little regarded, is of great importance to a farmer, and de&s;erves his clo&s;e&s;t attention. The expence is as great, may oftentimes greater, in keeping a creature of a bad breed as of a good, and the value is very different. It appears that the Canada breed of hor|&s;es would be found excellent for the plough or for draught, and the E&s;o|pus breed for the carriage. In the choice of hor&s;es, the form &s;hould be particularly attended to. The Cana|da breed comes the neare&s;t to the form of hor&s;es in the highe&s;t e&s;timation in England for draught, to wit, that of a true round barrel, remarkably &s;hort, and lower over the forehand than in any part of the back; the legs al&s;o &s;hort. The E&s;opus breed, of a pro|per &s;hape and &s;ize, are &s;ightly hor&s;es for a carriage: they are gentle, tract|able, and ea&s;ily broke, and yet have a proper degree of &s;pirit&mdash;have a good
<PB N="53" REF="031718_0052_0FEE1AEFB56B52D0">carriage; are ea&s;ily kept, and hardy. The Narragan&s;et breed have been ac|counted excellent for the &s;addle.</P>
<P>Mr. Bakewell, a farmer in England; has rendered him&s;elf famous by his breed of cattle. His principal aim is to gain the bea&s;t, whether &s;heep or cow, which will weigh mo&s;t in the mo&s;t valuable joints; and at the &s;ame time that he gains the &s;hape, which is of the greate&s;t value in the &s;malle&s;t compa&s;s; he finds, by experience, that he gains a breed much hardier, and ea&s;ier fed than any others. In the breed of cattle, his maxim is "the &s;maller the bones, the truer will be the make of the bea&s;t; the quicker it will fatten, and the weight will have a lar|ger proportion of valuable meat." The &s;hape, which &s;hould be the criterion of a cow, a bull, or an ox, and al&s;o of a &s;heep, is that of a hog&s;head or barrel, truly circular, with &s;mall and as &s;hort legs as po&s;&s;ible; upon this plain principle, that the value lies in the barrel, not in the legs. All breeds, the backs of which ri&s;e in the lea&s;t ridge, are bad.</P>
<P>By proper management, Mr. Bake|well
<PB N="54" REF="031718_0053_0FEE1AF141525160">brings up his cattle in amazing gentlene&s;s. His bulls &s;tand &s;till in the field to be examined. They are driven from one field to another, or home, by a little &s;witch. He or his men walk by their &s;ide, and guide them with a &s;tick wherever they plea&s;e. His cattle are always fat, and this he in&s;i&s;ts is owing to the excellence of the breed. The &s;mall quantity and inferior quality of the food, which will keep a bea&s;t perfectly well made, in good order, is &s;urpri&s;ing. Such an animal will grow fat in the &s;ame pa&s;|ture that would &s;tarve an ill made, great boned one.</P>
<P>He is equally curious in his breed of &s;heep. The bodies of his rams and ewes are as true barrels as can be &s;een, round broad backs, and the legs not above &s;ix inches long. An unu&s;ual proof of their kindly fattening, is their feeling quite fat within their fore-legs, on the ribs, where the common breed never carry any fat. He finds that hardly any land is too bad for a good breed of cattle, and particularly &s;heep.</P>
<P>With regard to the rot in &s;heep, Mr. Bakewell thinks it is &s;olely owing to their feeding on lands that have
<PB N="55" REF="031718_0054_0FEE1AF2C8FE94F0">been flooded. Hence it appears that &s;heep &s;hould not be &s;uffered to feed on watered meadows. Water flowing over the land after the beginning of May, is &s;ure to occa&s;ion the rot, what|ever be the &s;oil.</P>
<P>Mr. Bakewell is remarkably atten|tive to the point of wintering his cat|tle. All his cattle are tied up in open or other &s;heds all winter; and fed ac|cording to their kind; on &s;traw, tur|nips, or hay. The lean bea&s;ts have &s;traw alone. Young cattle, which re|quire to be kept in a thriving &s;tate, and al&s;o fattening ones, have turnips; and in the &s;pring, when turnips are gone, hay is wholly their &s;ub&s;titute. By the&s;e means he is able to keep a large &s;tock. His farm, in all, con|&s;i&s;ts of about 440 acres, 110 acres of which are arable, the re&s;t is gra&s;s; and he keeps &s;ixty hor&s;es, four hun|dred large &s;heep, one hundred and fifty horned bea&s;ts of all &s;orts, yet has generally fifteen acres of wheat and twenty-five acres of &s;pring corn.</P>
<P>He has adopted a new &s;y&s;tem in the management of his horned cattle. He u&s;ed to draw with teams of ox|en, and found that he mu&s;t keep
<PB N="56" REF="031718_0055_0FEE1AF45E241C38">double the number worked, to have one &s;et coming into work and ano|ther going out. He therefore chan|ged that &s;y&s;tem and draws all with cows. They are kept on &s;traw till three years old, then bulled and worked till four years old; by which means he finds a great &s;aving; and that calves bred from cows ri|&s;ing from-three to four, far exceed tho&s;e from cows ri&s;ing from two to three years. He finds al&s;o that the teams of cows are full as handy, and draw as well as oxen of the &s;ame &s;ize.</P>
<P>In working with cows or oxen, I am per&s;uaded, if harne&s;s was u&s;ed in&s;tead of yokes, the cattle would draw with much greater power, would move fa&s;ter, and be more handy and convenient. The har|ne&s;s &s;hould be much the &s;ame as that for hor&s;es; except the collar's o|pening to be b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">hled on, and be|ing worn in the contrary manner to hor&s;es, tha is, the narrow end of the collar which opens being downwards; and as the chains are fa&s;tened to them in the &s;ame direc|tion
<PB N="57" REF="031718_0056_0FEE1AFD4D6CF360">as in hor&s;e-harne&s;s, the cattle draw with them much higher than hor&s;es, the line of the chains being above the che&s;t, and almo&s;t up to their backs. This variation is ne|ce&s;&s;ary from the different &s;hapes of hor&s;es and oxen.</P>
<P>The &s;uffering the horns of cattle to grow, is oftentimes highly di&s;ad|vantageous, by the cattle's goring each other; and at the &s;ame time it renders them more unruly and un|tractable. For the&s;e rea&s;ons a far|mer in Penn&s;ylvania has fallen upon a practice to prevent the horns of his cattle from growing. His me|thod is, when a calf is a month old and the horns begin to &s;prout, he cuts off the knobs with a chizel, and with a &s;harp gouge pares them clean from the bone; he then &s;ears the wound and fills it with hog's lard. He &s;ays he never lo&s;t a calf by the operation, and that they did not &s;eem to thrive the le&s;s for it; that the lo&s;s of their offen&s;ive wea|pon &s;eemed to change the very na|ture of his cattle in re&s;pect to gen|tlene&s;s; and on that account he ap|prehended
<PB N="58" REF="031718_0057_0FEE1AFED5B7E020">his cows gave more milk, and his cattle were ea&s;ier rai&s;ed and hou&s;ed in the winter. For he could drive them young and old into a clo&s;e yard or &s;table like a flock of &s;heep, without difficulty or danger.</P>

<HEAD>Fifth. <HI>Re&s;pecting the orchard and its produce.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The care of orchards and the ma|king good cyder is &s;o very profita|ble, that it will nece&s;&s;arily draw the attention of every farmer.</P>
<P>Mr. Anderton, a gentleman in England, famed for good cyder, gives the following account of his approved method of making it.</P>
<P>"I &s;hould fir&s;t tell you my or|chards are on a clay &s;oil, which cir|cum&s;tance I think conduces much to the &s;trength and goodne&s;s of the li|quor. I will be &s;hort in my practi|cal account, making but few ob&s;er|vations, and leave the curious to draw &s;peculative reflections from it. I permit my fruit to remain on the trees till a great part of them fall by ripene&s;s; then gently &s;haking
<PB N="59" REF="031718_0058_0FEE1B005E163D70">the trees, take in the apples in dry weather, laying them in heaps of equal ripene&s;s in a loft over the pre&s;s. There they remain till they have per&s;pired, and that per&s;pirati|on cea&s;es. As &s;oon as convenient afterwards, I pre&s;s out the juice; if it ca&s;ts a pale colour I permit the pulp after it has pa&s;&s;ed the mill, to remain in vats or other open recep|tacles for twenty-four hours, which will heighten the colour of the juice. As &s;oon as it is impre&s;&s;ed, I pour it into vats through a &s;ieve, where it remains about two days and a night, according to the na|ture of the apple and the &s;tate of the weather, (the longe&s;t when a fro&s;t) till a thick head or &s;cum ri&s;es on it. Then I draw off a little in a gla&s;s to &s;ee if it is fine; and as &s;oon as I catch it &s;o, I fail not without delay to draw it off into open vats, if I have them, if not into hog&s;heads. If the juice be put from the pre&s;s into ve&s;&s;els wider at top than at bottom, and I draw it off as &s;oon as fine, I need not take off the head fir&s;t, as in going downwards, it
<PB N="60" REF="031718_0059_0FEE1B01E6777D08">will not, in that ca&s;e, break and mix with the body of the liquor. But if my ve&s;&s;el, in which it is, be of another con&s;truction, or I have not been attentive to draw it off in the critical hour, I find I do better before I begin to draw, to take off the head with a wooden &s;kimmer and throw it away, and then &s;peed|ily draw off the cyder. Whenever I find the brown head begins to o|pen in the middle or el&s;ewhere and a whitene&s;s appear at the opening, I'm pretty certain it is high time to be bu&s;y in drawing off. But I find from experience that the &s;ure&s;t to|ken is to ob&s;erve its &s;tate by what is drawn off in a gla&s;s, which is to be done by the help of a peg placed at a proper di&s;tance from the bot|tom of the vat, and this method of ob&s;ervation &s;hould be clo&s;ely attend|ed to; for I have drawn a gla&s;s of cyder out of a vat at eight o'clock, foul, another at ten, fine; almo&s;t candle-bright, without any appear|ance of the head's opening as above ob&s;erved: at eleven, it was grow|ing cloudy apace, without high
<PB N="61" REF="031718_0060_0FEE1B0AE38356D0">winds or any extraordinary event which I could perceive, to occa&s;ion it: and I found it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;a|ry not to loo&s;e a moment in drawing it off. If then drawn off into other open ve&s;&s;els, a fre&s;h head may ari&s;e in twenty-four hours or thereabouts, when it may be racked into a clo&s;e hog&s;head or other receiver, where it will begin to ferment after a day or two, according to the weather, the nature of the fruit, and other circum|&s;tances, I then permit it to ferment four or five days generally, never ex|ceeding a week for the harde&s;t fruit, &s;uch as wildings, &amp;c. Then I fumi|gate a clean &s;weet hog&s;head or other clo&s;e ve&s;&s;el, with a match or two made of coar&s;e cloth, dipped into melted &s;tone-brim&s;tone, and rack the cyder into it as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible, watch|ing it again in the &s;ame manner, till I catch it very fine. When another &s;uch racking often turns out the final one. I cover the bung with a tile or piece of thin wood only during the &s;ea&s;on of racking; and when I put a bung-cork into the hole in the &s;pring, I leave a peg-hole open ju&s;t by it.
<PB N="62" REF="031718_0061_0FEE1B0C6C548E78">The foeces through the whole proce&s;s are con&s;tantly removed. I never &s;eek to rai&s;e frequent fermentations, and often compleat the bu&s;ine&s;s by two or three rackings; but have had very good cyder, which has been &s;o prone to ferment, that I have been obliged to &s;top it by racking it into fumigated ve&s;&s;els ten, and even upwards of a dozen times. Many other, probably much better methods of &s;topping the fermentation, and bringing the cyder fine, I have heard of; but the&s;e are what I have in general hitherto u&s;ed, and have the &s;atisfaction of finding my cyder as good as mo&s;t I meet with el&s;ewhere. And though I am far from thinking my management unimprova|ble, I will an&s;wer for its turning out well to tho&s;e, who being unacquaint|ed with a better method, will attend to this."</P>
<P>On a farm managed as above men|tioned, where there will nece&s;&s;arily be much food for bees, the care and ma|nagement of them will naturally at|tract the attention of an intelligent farmer. The expence and trouble is &s;o trifling, and the profit &s;o great, that
<PB N="63" REF="031718_0062_0FEE1B0DF59EA388">he would be inexcu&s;able, if he did not add this to the profit of his farm.

<P>THE fir&s;t thing nece&s;&s;ary on &s;uch lands is, immediately after harve&s;t, to turn them up with the plough as
<PB N="64" REF="031718_0063_0FEE1B1157288338">deep as po&s;&s;ible. In order to do this effectually, it will &s;ometimes be need|ful for a &s;econd plough to follow the fir&s;t in the &s;ame furrow; which will throw the mould over, and bury the &s;tubble and weeds. In this ca&s;e there will be a new &s;oil uppermo&s;t, which, being fre&s;h to the air, will receive much greater and more la&s;ting bene|fit from the &s;un, the rain, and the fro&s;ts, than it otherwi&s;e could do, as thereby it will attract a greater quan|tity of the nutrition which the&s;e afford. The &s;tubble and weeds, being by this method of ploughing buried deep, will much &s;ooner rot than when ju&s;t cover|ed. In this &s;tate the ridges will lie high, and if the land be wet or of the brick-earth kind, will be full of clods or large lumps.</P>
<P>No time &s;hould now be lo&s;t by de|laying to render this newly turned-up &s;oil, as fine as harrowing can make it. I know in this particular, my judg|ment will be called in que&s;tion by numbers. Common farmers will &s;ay, "To what purpo&s;e is all this expence and labour, when, if the land be &s;uf|fered to lie in its rough &s;tate through
<PB N="65" REF="031718_0064_0FEE1B169D5097C8">the winter, the fro&s;ts and rains will do the work for you?" But this is the language of the &s;luggard and inexpe|rienced hu&s;bandman, only.</P>
<P>I am convinced, by repeated expe|riments, clo&s;e ob&s;ervations, and plain rea&s;oning on known facts, that lands which are made fine before the &s;harp fro&s;t and winter rains come on, will receive a much greater &s;hare of their influence than any other.</P>
<P>If the land be left in a rough &s;tate, there is &s;eldom time for the rains and fro&s;t to affect more than the out-&s;ide of the large clods or lumps; the out|&s;ide will indeed be pulverized, but the middle of the lumps, wherever they are large, will be found nearly in the &s;ame hard &s;tiff &s;tate as when turned up by the plough. Hence it mu&s;t appear to every one, that in this ea&s;e the benefit of air, winter rains, and fro&s;ts, on lands thus left, is par|tial; and the con&s;equence is, that harrowing it in the &s;pring, when the&s;e are over, is too late for its receiving the benefit which would have accrued from them; and the power of vegeta|tion is not &s;o vigorous.</P>

But to make winter fallows as fine as they can be in autumn, and then ridge them up in that pulver|ized &s;tate, is acting mo&s;t agreeable to nature. The greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible quantity of &s;urface is by this means expo&s;ed to the atmo&s;phere; and the land is left in a &s;tate wherein the rains and the fro&s;t are mo&s;t ea&s;ily admi&s;&s;ible. They will then pene|trate and enrich the whole ma&s;s to a greater depth.</P>
<P>If the fro&s;t penetrates a quantity of earth, formed into a large hard clod, partially, on account of its bulk and hardne&s;s (which is always &s;ound to be the ca&s;e) it is evident that the &s;ame clod, broken into four parts, would be thereby pene|trated four times as much; or, in other words four times the quanti|ty of earth would be affected by it, and on a thaw be pulverized. For we find that, after the breaking up of a &s;evere fro&s;t, all the &s;mall clods crumble ea&s;ily into powder; while the large ones are only made &s;mall|er by the crumbling of their &s;ur|face to a certain depth.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="031718_0066_0FEE1B1D6FE16A70">
By this deep ploughing which I have recommended, the worn-out foil being turned in, the &s;econd &s;tra|tum or fre&s;h earth is now upper|mo&s;t; and having, by being made as fine as it can be in autumn, been expo&s;ed to the air, the rain, and the fro&s;t during winter, is thereby &s;weetened and clean&s;ed of its impu|rities; and thus becomes a new fre&s;h fertilized earth, in the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible &s;tate, for vigorous vegeta|tion.</P>
<P>Many farmers will probably ob|ject to this method, on account of its being attended with a little ex|tra expence. But I wi&s;h them to con&s;ider, fir&s;t, that this expen&s;e is more in appearance than reality, for le&s;s labour is requi&s;ite in the &s;pring; and &s;econdly, that it will be amply repaid by the goodne&s;s of &s;ucceed|ing crops.</P>
<P>About &s;even years &s;ince, I made a comparative experiment of this kind on a field of ten acres, the &s;oil of which was equal as po&s;&s;ible in goodne&s;s. The one half of this field I left after ploughing in its
<PB N="68" REF="031718_0067_0FEE1B20D3A914C0">rough &s;tate, the &s;urface being co|vered with large hard clods. The other half I made as fine as po&s;&s;ible by harrowing with ox harrows, and beating in pieces the harde&s;t and large&s;t clods which the harrow would not break.</P>
<P>In the &s;pring, the part I had har|rowed was much finer, without any additional labour, than I could ren|der the other (which was left in its rough &s;tate) by repeated harrow|ings; for the rain and the fro&s;t ha|ving not penetrated the middle of the large clods, they had received no benefit therefrom, and were as hard as bricks, being only le&s;&s;ened in &s;ize.</P>
<P>I &s;owed the whole field in barley the la&s;t week in April, and threw nine pounds of broad clover in with it. On harve&s;ting it, I kept the crops &s;eperate: the part left rough produced twenty-four bu&s;hels per acre; the other thirty-one, the lat|ter by much the fine&s;t &s;ample. The crop of clover next year was equal|ly in favour of the method I am re|commending, being heavier by near half a ton per acre.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="031718_0068_0FEE1B242F927780">
The extra expence on this part was only about eight &s;hillings per a|cre; the extra produce yielded an extra profit of more than twenty &s;hillings per acre.</P>

<HEAD>A method for preventing the de&s;truction of Apple-trees, by Canker worms.</HEAD>
<P>THE in&s;ects from which the can|ker worms are produced, are hid in the ground near the root of the tree, not far from the &s;urface, and make their appearance as &s;oon as the &s;now is off, and the top of the ground &s;oft (which &s;ometimes hap|pens as early as February.) The males have wings, and frequently fly directly to the limbs, without touching the body of the tree; for|tunately the females have none, but are a very clum&s;y bug, and very ea&s;ily &s;topped by tarring the tree. To do this with &s;ucce&s;s, it is very nece&s;&s;ary, that the tar made u&s;e of be of a proper con&s;i&s;tence; if it be very thick it will be impo&s;&s;ible to lay it on without fir&s;t heating,
<PB N="70" REF="031718_0069_0FEE1B27D2B68ED0">which makes it form a hard &s;ur|face when cold, that &s;uffers the bug to pa&s;s over without difficulty; &s;ome endeavour to remedy this in|convenience by mixing train oil with the tar, but the thin kind of tar without oil is far preferable; if this be expo&s;ed to the &s;un through the day it will be &s;ufficiently &s;oft to be laid on with a bru&s;h. It is be&s;t the rough bark &s;hould be &s;cra|ped off with a hoe or &s;ome other convenient in&s;trument, and the tar put round the tree about four inch|es wide; this operation mu&s;t be re|peated every day, when the &s;tate of the ground will permit them to move, until they have done going up. It is not common that the weather is &s;uch as to permit them to &s;tir until the middle, and often until the latter end of March; when that is the ca&s;e, and the weather continues warm, they will be all out of the ground in about fourteen days; but as they are commonly interrupted with &s;now or cold, it will generally be nece&s;&s;ary to tar as many as twenty times, and &s;ome|times
<PB N="71" REF="031718_0070_0FEE1B295C0A44B8">more. The time that is ge|nerally cho&s;en to begin is about two hours before &s;un-&s;et (which is the time the in&s;ects begin to move) and if not fini&s;hed until an hour after the &s;un is down (after the fir&s;t time) it is immaterial, for the tar that is already on the tree, &s;oftened by the warmth of the &s;un, will be &s;uffici|ent to &s;top them until that time. I am &s;en&s;ible there have been &s;eve|ral objections to this method of tar|ring, viz. that it is attended with trouble and expence; that it in|jures the tree, and after all that it is ineffectual. As to the expence, a barrel of tar is &s;ufficient for an orchard that will make an hundred barrels of cyder; and four per&s;ons in two hours will be able to tar the whole at once; allowing this to be repeated twenty times, the expence cannot be great, and experience has &s;ufficiently proved, that it does not injure the tree. I know of &s;everal orchards that have been tarred (as often as the worms vi&s;ited them) for twenty years, and could never perceive any injury done them; on
<PB N="72" REF="031718_0071_0FEE1B305EE2DC40">the contrary, I know of &s;ome others in the &s;ame neighbourhood, that have not been tarred, entirely de|&s;troyed by the worms. If the tree be thrifty, it will be nece&s;&s;ary &s;ome time in the &s;ummer following, to &s;crape off the tar, or make a few inci&s;ions through it, to prevent the bark from being confined. That it has never proved ineffectual, I be|lieve no one can produce an in|&s;tance, where proper &s;teps have been taken; but where it has fail|ed, it has been owing to improper management, or want of per&s;eve|rance.</P>

<HEAD>Observations on the management of Bees, with directions for taking their honey without de&s;troying them.</HEAD>
<P>BEES, an indu&s;trious and profit|able &s;pecies of in&s;ects. Rural eco|nomy is incomplete, where bees are wanting. The co&s;t of keeping them is nothing, and the care that is re|quired about them is but trifling.</P>
<P>There are three &s;orts of bees in a hive: 1. The Queen bee, which
<PB N="73" REF="031718_0072_0FEE1B31E728CF90">is larger, and of a brighter red than the re&s;t. Her bu&s;ine&s;s is to conduct the new &s;warms and lay eggs in the cells for a new brood: and her fer|tility is &s;o great, that &s;he brings forth many thou&s;ands of young ones in a year. 2. The drones, which have no &s;tings, are of a darker co|lour than the re&s;t, and are &s;uppo&s;ed to be the males. 3. The honey|bees, or working bees, which are by far more numerous than the other two kinds.</P>
<P>A bee-hou&s;e &s;hould be &s;ituated at a good di&s;tance from the places where cattle are kept, e&s;pecially from hog-&s;ties, hen and dove-hou|&s;es, and remote from filth and dung|hills. It &s;hould be defended from high wind on all &s;ides, &s;o far as may be, con&s;i&s;tently with admitting the heat of the &s;un. The hou&s;e &s;hould be open to the &s;outh or &s;outh-we&s;t, and the back-&s;ide &s;hould be very tight; with a tight roof projecting, that driving rains may not injure the bees. If &s;now lodges upon or about the hives, it &s;hould be bru&s;h|ed off without delay. The bench
<PB N="74" REF="031718_0073_0FEE1B336F969630">on which the hives &s;tand, &s;hould be a little canting outwards, that if wet &s;hould fall on it, it may run off without entering the hives. Mr. Bromwick propo&s;es, "that a bee|hou&s;e be boarded in front; and that the back-&s;ide &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of three doors, which opened, give a full view of the hives, and give oppor|tunity to a&s;&s;i&s;t or lift them. All &s;eams &s;hould be &s;topped which would admit in&s;ects, from which the hou&s;e is often to be bru&s;hed.</P>
<P>"If the hou&s;e &s;hould be in dan|ger of being too hot, when thus enclo&s;ed, it may be occa&s;ionally &s;haded with boughs of trees. As winter approaches, all the &s;eams of the hou&s;e are plai&s;tered with clay. In very cold climates, the hou&s;e &s;hould be filled with &s;traw, to keep the bees warm, watching again&s;t mice, and removing the &s;traw in the &s;pring.</P>
<P>"Cut a hole through the front, of the &s;ame &s;ize as the mouth of the lower hive, and directly again&s;t it. Under this pa&s;&s;age, on a level with the floor, is a lighting board, at
<PB N="75" REF="031718_0074_0FEE1B34F80840E8">the mouth of each hive, of about five inches long and three wide. It is a little &s;helf for the bees to land upon after their excur&s;ions. The&s;e being &s;eparate, not in one piece of the length of the hou&s;e, is to pre|vent intercour&s;e between colony and colony; but more e&s;&s;entially to prevent mice, &s;nails, and other in|truders. The&s;e alighting boards are &s;ometimes painted of different colours, to direct each bee to his home more readily. A long &s;hel|ving board &s;hould be placed over the alighting boards, to &s;helter the bees in a rainy time. It &s;hould be twelve inches wide, and placed nine inches above the mouths of the hives."</P>
<P>Broom, clover, and mu&s;tard, are &s;aid to afford bees an excellent pa&s;|ture, and they appear very fond of the flowers of poppies. Gardens, and any places where flowers a|bound, and e&s;pecially where there is a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of flowers through the greater part of the year, are the mo&s;t favourable to them: for they undoubtedly draw the princi|pal
<PB N="76" REF="031718_0075_0FEE1B3A2C511F90">part of their honey from the nectaria of flowers. Fields of buck|wheat are good, as they continue in bloom for a long time. In Ger|many they move their bee-hives in boats, to the neighbouring fields of buckwheat.</P>
<P>Bees are wont to &s;end out new &s;warms in May and June. Much has been written concerning the management of them on the&s;e occa|&s;ions. But the new mode of mana|ging them renders all this unnece&s;|&s;ary.&mdash;It is this: let the bee-hou&s;e be made &s;o tall as to admit three tier of hives, one above another. The hives &s;hould not be tall &s;haped, but rather broad and &s;hort, that they may take up le&s;s room. A hive of &s;uch dimen&s;ions as to be equal to a cube of thirteen inches, will be &s;ufficiently capacious. Mr. Ther|ley directs that they &s;hould be ten inches deep, and from twelve to fourteen broad in the in&s;ide. If hives be made larger, the &s;warms will not multiply &s;o fa&s;t. An under hive is made with a round hole through the top, of three inches
<PB N="77" REF="031718_0076_0FEE1B41314B5E98">diameter, covered with a &s;liding &s;hutter. Each hive or box &s;hould have a pa&s;&s;age at the bottom for the bees to pa&s;s in and out, 4 or 5 inches long, and about one third of an inch deep. One of the&s;e hives &s;hould be placed directly under an inhabited hive, before they are di&s;|po&s;ed to &s;end out a new &s;warm. This will prevent the going out of a &s;warm, and &s;ave trouble and watching: for in&s;tead of &s;warming when the upper hive is full, they will build and depo&s;it their honey in the one that is below; and when that is full, let them find another beneath it:&mdash;they will take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ion of the lowermo&s;t. It is their manner always to begin at the top, and build downwards. For ano|ther method of management, &s;ee "Cohite's collateral Bee-boxes."</P>
<P>When the top hive is well filled with honey, it may be di&s;covered by lifting it, or more accurately by weighing it gently with a &s;teelyard, in a cool morning, when the bees are &s;tiff, and not apt to come out.</P>
<P>When a hive is taken up, there
<PB N="78" REF="031718_0077_0FEE1B42BA9901D0">is no need of murdering the poor infects with fire and brim&s;tone, as has been the u&s;ual practice: only drive in the &s;hutter, and run a thin long knife round, to part it from that which is below it; &s;lip the hive off upon a &s;mooth piece of board, or &s;lide the board under, and carry the hive into your dwell|ing hou&s;e, which you may do in a cool morning without any danger from their &s;tings. Lay the hive upon its &s;ide, and have a window of the room open. As the &s;un gets up, and the air grows warmer, they will quit the hive, and go in|to the hive next to the place whence they were taken. When you take out the honey, which &s;hould be done &s;peedily, the bees that are found among the honey, &s;tiff and unable to fly, &s;hould be thrown in|to a tub of water. They will &s;oon recover their activity, and go after their companions.</P>
<P>Some practi&s;e feeding bees. But &s;ays one, "There is but little u&s;e in it, becau&s;e tho&s;e which have not a good &s;tock of honey to &s;erve them through the winter, are not fit to
<PB N="79" REF="031718_0078_0FEE1B444677D2A0">keep."&mdash;He adds, "There are &s;ome &s;tocks of bees in the &s;pring time, that may &s;eem worthy of our care to pre&s;erve; &s;uch as have but little honey, and a good number of bees, by means of a cold and dry &s;pring, yet in all probability may prove an excellent &s;tock, and may be worth con&s;ideration."</P>
<P>"The be&s;t method of &s;upplying bees with food, is by &s;mall canes, or troughs conveyed into their hives; and beginning in March when they begin to breed, and &s;it on their young, it mu&s;t be daily continued, till the &s;ea&s;on affords ea&s;e and provi&s;ion abroad.</P>
<P>"Honey is not only the be&s;t, but the mo&s;t natural of all food, and will go much farther mixed well with a moderate quantity of good &s;weet wort. Some pre&s;cribe toa&s;ts of bread &s;opped in good ale, and put into the hive, whereof they will not leave one crumb remain|ing."</P>
<P>Mr. Therley advi&s;es when &s;tocks of bees are weak, to double them, which he thinks the mo&s;t effectual way of pre&s;erving them in common
<PB N="80" REF="031718_0079_0FEE1B45CE372130">hives. He does it by the help of a fume, or opiate, which will &s;o &s;tupify them for a time, that they may be handled at plea&s;ure. Ha|ving done this the queen mu&s;t be &s;earched for and killed. And exa|mine whither the &s;tock to which you intend to join the bees of ano|ther, have honey enough to main|tain the bees of both: it &s;hould weigh twenty pounds.</P>
<P>"The narcotic or &s;tupifying fume, is made with the large mu&s;h|room, commonly known by the name of bunt, puckfi&s;t, or froge|hu&s;e. It is of a brown colour, turns to powder, and is exceeding light. Put one of the&s;e pucks in a large paper; pre&s;s it therein to two thirds, or half its former bulk, and tie it up very clo&s;e; then put it into an oven after the bread has been drawn, and let it remain there all night. When it is dry enough to hold fire, it is fit for u&s;e. The manner of u&s;ing it is thus:</P>
<P>"Cut off a piece of puck as large as a hen's egg, and fix it in the end of a &s;mall &s;tick &s;lit for that purpo&s;e, and &s;harpened at the other end,
<PB N="81" REF="031718_0080_0FEE1B4EB61517C0">which place &s;o that the puck may hang near the middle of the empty hive. This hive mu&s;t be &s;et with the mouth upwarps, near the &s;tock you intend to take. This being done, &s;et fire to the puck, and im|mediately place the &s;tock of bees over it, tying a cloth round the hives, that no &s;moke may come forth. In a minute's time, you will hear the bees fall like drops of hail, into the empty hive. You may then beat the top of the hive gently with your hand, to get out as many of them as you can. After this, loo&s;ing the cloth, lift the hive off to a table, knock it &s;everal times again&s;t the table, &s;everal more bees will tumble out, and perhaps the queen among them. She often is one of the la&s;t that falls. If &s;he is not there, &s;earch for her among the main body in the empty hive, &s;preading them for this purpo&s;e on the table.</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t proceed in the &s;ame manner with the other hive, with the bees of which the&s;e are to be united. One of the queens being &s;ecured, you mu&s;t put the bees of
<PB N="82" REF="031718_0081_0FEE1B50439A2E20">both hives together; mingle them thoroughly, and drop them among the combs of the hive which they are intended to inhabit. When they are all in, cover it with a packing or coar&s;e cloth, which will admit air, and let them re|main &s;hut up all that night, and the next day. You will &s;oon be &s;en&s;ible they are awaked from their &s;leep.</P>
<P>"The &s;econd night after their union, in the du&s;k of the evening, gently remove the cloth from off the mouth of the hive, and the bees will immediately &s;ally forth with a great noi&s;e, but being too late they will &s;oon return. Then keep them confined for two or three days, after which the door may be le&s;t open."</P>
<P>It is convenient to have a pane of gla&s;s in each hive, in order to watch the motions of the bees, and to know by in&s;pection when is the right time to take up a hive. The Rev. Mr. White &s;ays, "In the back part you mu&s;t cut a hole with a rabbet, in which you are to fix a pane of the cleare&s;t and be&s;t crown
<PB N="83" REF="031718_0082_0FEE1B51CB1E63C8">gla&s;s, about five inches in length, and three in breadth, and fa&s;ten it with putty. Let the top of the gla&s;s be placed as high as the roof within&s;ide, that you may &s;ee the up|per part of the combs, where the bees with their riches are mo&s;tly placed. You will, by this means, be the bet|ter able to judge of their &s;tate and &s;trength, than if your gla&s;s was fixed in the middle. The gla&s;s mu&s;t be co|vered with a thin piece of board by way of &s;hutter, which may be made to hang by a &s;tring, or turn upon a nail, or &s;lide &s;ideways between two mouldings. Such as are de&s;irous of &s;eeing more of the bees' works, may make the gla&s;s as large as the box will admit, without weakening it too much. Or they may add a pane of gla&s;s on the top, which mu&s;t likewi&s;e be co|vered with a &s;hutter, fa&s;tened down with pegs to prevent accidents.</P>
<P>"Be careful to fa&s;ten the &s;hutter &s;o clo&s;e to the gla&s;s, that no light may enter; for the bees &s;eem to look up|on &s;uch a light as a hole, or breach in their hou&s;e, and on that account may not &s;o well like their habitation."</P>
