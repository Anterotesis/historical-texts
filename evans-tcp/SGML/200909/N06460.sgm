<P>ENTER into his Gates with Thank&s;|giving, and into his Courts with Prai&s;e: be thankful unto him, and ble&s;s his Name.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WE are this day called in the good providence of God, and exhorted by our civil rulers, to di&s;charge the duty which the royal P&s;almi&s;t here inculcates on the people of I&s;rael: I mean, publickly and &s;olemnly to render thanks to almighty God, for his great and unde&s;erved mercies. It does not indeed appear, that either the p&s;alm in general, or the words read in particular, were occa&s;ioned by
<PB N="6" REF="008192_0004_102E49AED0FF9FA0">
any &s;pecial or remarkable interpo&s;itions of divine pro|vidence in favour of the Jews; but rather, that the p&s;alm has re&s;pect thro out to the goodne&s;s of God in general towards his people: So that the admonition in the text may properly be con&s;idered as a &s;tanding, perpetual exhortation to the people of God in all ages and generations, to pay their public united ac|knowledgments to him for his mercies. However, tho' the exhortation is in it&s;elf thus general or inde|finite, you are &s;en&s;ible that there are &s;ome particular times and &s;ea&s;ons, wherein all &s;uch general coun&s;els demand a &s;pecial attention; wherein there is a pecu|liar propriety in ob&s;erving them; and in which, it would therefore be doubly criminal to di&s;regard them. And this being con&s;idered, I humbly conceive, there will at lea&s;t appear no impropriety in my choice of the&s;e words, for the ground of my di&s;cour&s;es on the pre&s;ent joyful occa&s;ion: E&s;pecially if it be fur|ther con&s;idered, that the mercies and ble&s;&s;ings, for which we are now entered into the courts of our God with prai&s;e, are not, all of them, peculiar to the pre|&s;ent &s;ea&s;on; but &s;ome of them of &s;uch long conti|nuance, that they may, with re&s;pect to us, be looked upon as common mercies; tho' not the le&s;s valuable in them&s;elves on that account, nor the le&s;s demand|ing our gratitude and prai&s;e to the Father of lights, from whom every good and perfect gift de&s;cendeth.</P>
<P>IT is therefore propos'd, by divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance,</P>
<P>FIRST, To repre&s;ent to you, as particularly as the time will well allow, what tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings are, to give thanks to God for which, we are now a&s;&s;embled in his hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="008192_0005_102E4972F6E6CB58">SECONDLY, I &s;hall explain, and inculcate upon you, the duty of religious thankfulne&s;s for the&s;e mercies, And</P>
<P>LASTLY, I &s;hall pre&s;s it upon you to live an|&s;werably to the obligations which God has laid us under by be&s;towing them upon us.</P>
<P N="1">I. LET me repre&s;ent to you, as particularly as is convenient, what tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings are, to give thanks to God for which, we are now a&s;&s;embled together. For unle&s;s we have &s;ome ju&s;t and proper conception of the&s;e, it is impo&s;&s;ible for us to be duly and ra|tionally thankful, or to give God the glory due unto his name on account of them.</P>
<P>IN &s;peaking of the&s;e mercies, I &s;hall not have occa&s;ion, nor indeed would it be altogether proper, to go beyond his Excellency's proclamation, ap|pointing this day to be religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved&punc; and &s;pecifying the occa&s;ion, or particular rea&s;ons thereof. Now the&s;e various ble&s;&s;ings may ea&s;ily be reduced to, and ranged under, the following heads, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. THOSE which relate to the civil &s;tate of the nation in general; as the pre&s;ervation of the Briti&s;h government, and of our rights and liberties; toge|ther with the happy pro&s;pect we have of their being long continued to us.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. THOSE which relate particularly to the pre|&s;ent war; or the &s;ucce&s;&s;es given to his Maje&s;ty's arms, the la&s;t year, and to the arms of his royal and illu&s;trious ally, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. And,</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="8" REF="008192_0006_102E49B266A54B98">3dly. THOSE which relate more e&s;pecially to this province; as the fruitfulne&s;s of the pa&s;t &s;ea&s;on, and the general plenty and health, with which we have been favour'd.</P>
<P>WHATEVER is mentioned in the Governor's pro|clamation, as a ground for our religious rejoycing and thankfulne&s;s to God at this time, may, I &s;uppo&s;e, naturally fall under one or the other of the&s;e heads. Let us proceed to a more di&s;tinct con&s;ideration of them: tho' it is propo&s;ed to enlarge chiefly on the &s;econd.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. LET us con&s;ider tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings which relate to the civil &s;tate of the <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>By</HI> the nation in general, <HI>are here intended,</HI> all Briti&s;h &s;ubjects.</NOTE> nation in general; as the pre&s;ervation of the Briti&s;h government, and of our rights and liberties; together with the happy pro&s;pect we have of their being long continued to us.</P>
<P>THE ble&s;&s;ings of this cla&s;s are referred to in the former part of his Excellency's proclamation, where it is ob&s;erved, that it <Q>hath plea&s;ed the Fa|ther of mercies to continue us in the enjoyment of many invaluable ble&s;&s;ings,&mdash;to prolong the important life of our mo&s;t gracious Sovereign; and to continue to us the pro&s;pect of that invalu|able ble&s;&s;ing, the prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, in his royal hou&s;e; to &s;upport us in our civil and religious rights and liberties.</Q> The&s;e, tho' mentioned as mercies which we have long enjoyed, are neverthe|le&s;s, truly great; and ought, from time to time to be &s;olemnly recognized by us as &s;uch, e&s;pecially upon public occa&s;ions like the pre&s;ent. The Briti&s;h go|vernment and laws, by which the &s;ubject's life and liberty, his property and religion, are all &s;o well
<PB N="9" REF="008192_0007_102E4976AF8EC248">
&s;ecured to him, are ble&s;&s;ings, very exten&s;ive in their nature, and will ever be accounted invaluable, by all who have a ju&s;t conception of what the happine&s;s of civil &s;ociety con&s;i&s;ts in; or who have really any religion, which they can rea&s;onably think them&s;elves bound in con&s;cience to practi&s;e. Indeed &s;uch a free and happy form of government as the Briti&s;h, may po&s;&s;ibly be di&s;reli&s;hed by abject minds, long tutor'd to &s;ervility, or blinded and infatuated by a horrid &s;u|per&s;tition, the rever&s;e of all rational piety. However, the&s;e per&s;ons are not exceptions to the above a&s;&s;er|tion, having neither any proper notion of civil hap|pine&s;s, nor any religion which a well-informed con|&s;cience could po&s;&s;ibly concern it&s;elf at all about, unle&s;s it were &s;o far as to di&s;card it with indignation. Whatever, &s;laves, and the blind votaries to &s;uch a &s;uper&s;tition, fal&s;ely called religion, may think; or however evil they may <Q>&s;peak of tho&s;e things which they under&s;tand not,</Q> wi&s;e, good and un|prejudiced men, will always venerate &s;uch a con&s;ti|tution of government, thinking them&s;elves happy if they live under it, and if they do not, envying to tho&s;e that do, &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hing a priviledge.</P>
<P>OF this free government, and of the&s;e laws, which, next to tho&s;e of the go&s;pel, may be ju&s;tly termed "the laws of liberty", his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty has all along, from his fir&s;t acce&s;&s;ion to the throne, been a &s;teady defender; being both a true prote&s;tant, and a friend to the natural rights of mankind, e&s;pecially to tho&s;e of his own &s;ubjects. For which rea&s;on it ought to be looked on as a great &s;mile of heaven upon the nation, that his life has been lengthened out till he is now become old, and full of days. And tho' his good &s;ubjects cannot, without reluctance, think on that time, now near according to the u&s;ual
<PB N="10" REF="008192_0008_102E49B3EB760D88">
cour&s;e of nature, when their royal benefactor and father mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the common law of mortality; yet we are in &s;ome mea&s;ure relieved under the me|lancholly apprehen&s;ion, by reflecting on his nume|rous po&s;terity, and &s;eeing the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the Briti&s;h throne, made as &s;ure as human laws can make it, in his royal and prote&s;tant hou&s;e. I add prote&s;tant hou&s;e, not only becau&s;e, by the act of &s;ettlement and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, none but a prote&s;tant can reign upon the Briti&s;h throne; but al&s;o, becau&s;e the happine&s;s of the nation, under God, e&s;&s;entially depends on being govern'd by &s;uch a king; and this illu&s;trious hou&s;e has long di&s;tingui&s;h'd it&s;elf by a well-regulated zeal for the prote&s;tant cau&s;e, in oppo&s;ition to papal u&s;urpation.</P>
<P>IT were next to madne&s;s to imagine, that the nation could ever be &s;afe and happy under a roman catholic prince: Common &s;en&s;e &s;hows, that &s;uch a one mu&s;t needs think his power too much re&s;trained by the laws of Britain; looking on which as an in|fringement of the royal dignity, he would of cour&s;e make frequent infractions on them; at lea&s;t as often, and perhaps oftener, than he could do it with &s;afe|ty to him&s;elf. Fact and experience are not wanting to confirm this ob&s;ervation. For the nation has formerly had melancholly experience of its truth, in at lea&s;t two princes of the Stewart race; who&s;e arbitrary principles and practices, naturally, if not nece&s;&s;arily connected with their religion, plainly &s;hew'd that one of the greate&s;t cur&s;es righteous heaven can &s;end upon Great Britain, is a romanca|tholic King. While &s;uch a King reigns, the mo&s;t fundamental laws of the kingdom are no &s;ecurity to the &s;ubject, either with re&s;pect to liberty or pro|perty, religion or life; unle&s;s it be to popi&s;h &s;ub|jects:
<PB N="11" REF="008192_0009_102E497A90BB10D8">
Who indeed may live, and increa&s;e, and flou|ri&s;h abundantly, under that &s;ame baleful influence which bla&s;ts all good men. And if God, in his good providence, had not delivered the nation from the contemptible, tho' royal race above-mentioned, it is not improbable, that we might at this very time have groaned under the iron &s;cepter of a confirmed, lawle&s;s de&s;poti&s;m, and the antichri&s;tian yoke of reli|gious per&s;ecution: Unle&s;s, perhaps, before this time all good prote&s;tants had been rooted out and de|&s;troyed; and &s;o made a mighty addition to the &s;ouls which St. John &s;aw under the altar; the &s;ouls of <Q>them that were &s;lain for the word of God&punc; and for the te&s;timony which they held:</Q> and which he heard <Q>crying with a loud voice, &s;aying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, do&s;t thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rev. 6.9, 10.</NOTE>!</Q></P>
<P>THESE things being briefly ob&s;erved, I may leave you to judge, how great the ble&s;&s;ing is, of having the life of a good prote&s;tant King, the Briti&s;h govern|ment, and with it our rights and liberties, &s;ecular and &s;acred, pre&s;erved to us; and this, while we have had &s;o many enemies, at lea&s;t foreign ones, who would have rejoiced in depriving us of them.</P>
<P>BUT let us now proceed to tho&s;e mercies which were above referred to another cla&s;s; <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2dly. THOSE which relate to the pre&s;ent war; as the &s;ucce&s;&s;es given, the la&s;t year, to the arms of his Maje&s;ty, and to the arms of his illu&s;trious ally, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. Upon the&s;e, I &s;hall be &s;ome|thing more particular than on the former. They
<PB N="12" REF="008192_0010_102E49B6AD251160">
hold the &s;econd place in his Excellency's proclamation; where it is ob&s;erved, That it hath plea&s;ed God <Q>to give remarkable &s;pirit to his Maje&s;ty's coun&s;els and re&s;olutions; and in divers in&s;tances to crown his wi&s;e and vigorous mea&s;ures with &s;ucce&s;s; and to pro&s;per the arms of his Maje&s;ty's ally the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, in &s;upport of the prote&s;tant cau&s;e,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>IT is manife&s;t, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome &s;trange delays, defeats and di&s;graces; (with a detail of which, the religious joy and gratitude of this day ought not to be damped) It is, I &s;ay, manife&s;t, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e delays and di&s;graces, that the war has been pro&s;ecuted the la&s;t year, on the part of Great Britain, with uncommon vigour; and that the advantages gained both by &s;ea and land, have been very con&s;ide|rable: So that, upon the whole, this has been, to us, a &s;ucce&s;sful campaign; and, in proportion, di&s;advan|tageous, and a weakening to the enemy. Let us take a cur&s;ory view of the events of the war this year, and of the lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained by the enemy, both by land and &s;ea. But minute circum&s;tances would not be thought worthy of a place here, tho' there were room for them.</P>
<P>IF we begin with our &s;ucce&s;&s;es by land; It is to be ob&s;erved, that his Maje&s;ty's hereditary dominions on the continent have been re&s;cu'd out of the ene|my's hands, where they triumphed the year before, and committed &s;uch barbarian havock and deva&s;tation. They have in their turn been beaten and routed there, with con&s;iderable lo&s;s both of men, and war|like &s;tores: So that their laurels had but ju&s;t bloomed, when they were &s;uddenly withered, and the cypre&s;s &s;ucceeded them: Whereby was verified that antient ob&s;ervation, <Q>That the triumphing of the wicked is &s;hort, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a

moment; tho' his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Job XX. 5, 6.</NOTE>.</Q> And there is &s;ome rea&s;on at lea&s;t to hope, that the enemy will not &s;oon be in a capacity to make them|&s;elves again ma&s;ters of that country, and repeat their brutal outrages, loudly complained of even by &s;ome of their own greate&s;t commanders<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mar&s;hal Bellei&s;le's Speech in Council, is here more particu|larly alluded to.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE have, moreover, been at lea&s;t two <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">At St. Maloes and Cherbourg.</NOTE> &s;uc|ce&s;sful de&s;cents made by Great Britain on the coa&s;ts of France. In the&s;e the enemy have &s;u&s;tained the lo&s;s of &s;ome con&s;iderable magazines, &s;everal fortre&s;&s;es, many cannon, and military &s;tores; all amounting to a large value: And were likewi&s;e obliged, by ano|ther large &s;um, to ran&s;om one of their cities, or fortified towns. The&s;e events are not a little in our favour; to &s;ay nothing of the con&s;tant alarms on the French coa&s;ts the la&s;t year, with the con&s;e|quences thereof; or the &s;ecurity enjoyed on the coa&s;ts of Britain. It may be added, that the&s;e de|&s;cents would doubtle&s;s have proved of &s;till more pernicious con&s;equence to the enemy than they have, tho' le&s;s honourable to the Briti&s;h General, had not his noble brea&s;t been full of that compa&s;&s;ion, that humanity and genero&s;ity, to which &s;ome of the French commanders, under the like circum&s;tances, have &s;hown them&s;elves &s;trangers<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Witne&s;s, particularly, the Ma&s;&s;acre after the Surrender of Fort William-Henry to Mon&s;. Montealm, and the &s;igning of the Capitulation.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ON the we&s;tern coa&s;ts of Affrica &s;everal forts have been taken from the enemy, together with one
<PB N="14" REF="008192_0012_102E49B937529518">
of their important &s;ettlements<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Senegal.</NOTE>; whereby, it is &s;aid, great trea&s;ures have fallen into the hands of the captors. And, by what we have hitherto learn'd, this conque&s;t may probably prove eventually of very great advantage to Great Britain, and at lea&s;t equally detrimental to the commerce and intere&s;t of France.</P>
<P>AS to the Ea&s;t Indies; our accounts from thence, &s;eem to be quite vague and uncertain at be&s;t, if not contradictory. So that we can &s;ay nothing particu|larly or po&s;itively concerning the &s;tate of affairs in A&s;ia, with re&s;pect to the war; or whether we, or our enemies, have been &s;ucce&s;sful in tho&s;e di&s;tant parts. Let us therefore come to America.</P>
<P>AND here the very &s;trong, and at lea&s;t equally important city and fortre&s;s of the enemy on Cape Breton, have &s;urrender'd to his Maje&s;ty's arms, where a prodigious quantity of artillery, &s;mall-arms, and military &s;tores of all kinds, fell into our hands. In con&s;equence of which acqui&s;ition, obtained with an incon&s;iderable lo&s;s of Briti&s;h troops, all the de|pendencies of Louisbourg, have been &s;urrender'd; and many thou&s;ands of the enemy &s;ent out of America, where their continuance might have proved of very pernicious con&s;equence. I might add, that hereby the enemy have in effect lo&s;t, not only their great fi&s;hery, but the key of Canada; on which &s;ome of their more &s;outhern forts and &s;ettlements are dependent. It would have been proper to en|large on the importance of this acqui&s;ition, and the very favourable circum&s;tances attending it had I not lately done this &s;o particularly, on the day ap|pointed by the government to acknowledge the great goodne&s;s of God on account hereof.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="008192_0013_102E497EA42A7028">HIS maje&s;ty's forces have al&s;o, the &s;ummer pa&s;t, taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the river, and adjacent country, of St. John's, in the bay of Funda: Of the great con&s;equence of which to them, and to their views in America, the French were &s;o fully appri&s;ed, that according to their wonted policy and good faith, they &s;ei&s;ed, and fortified thereon, &s;everal years ago, in a time of profound peace. They were indeed forced by &s;ome Briti&s;h troops, about two years &s;ince, to abandon, and, as &s;ome &s;ay, to demo|li&s;h the fortre&s;s which they had erected there. But till this year we had not fortified, nor done any thing which could well be called taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place: Both which being now done, it may be rea&s;onably hoped, that the future po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that important river and fine country, are effectually &s;ecured to his Britannic maje&s;ty, to whom, of right, they unque&s;tionably belonged before.</P>
<P>IN addition to what has already been mention|ed, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that a fortre&s;s of great con|&s;equence, u&s;ually called Frontinac, at the entrance of the great river St. Lawrence on the lake &s;ide, has been reduced to &s;urrender to a body of his maje&s;ty's troops, chiefly provincial irregulars. This acqui&s;i|tion may be reckoned very con&s;iderable in divers re&s;pects&punc; in re&s;pect of the &s;trength of the fortre&s;s it&s;elf; of its &s;ituation; of the va&s;t quantity of &s;tores, provi&s;ions, arms, and other riches found therein; in re&s;pect of the little lo&s;s of men in ma|king it&punc; and la&s;tly, in re&s;pect of the critical conjunc|ture wherein it was made. For we are a&s;&s;ured, that a con&s;iderable body of the enemy were at that time actually in motion&punc; to proceed again&s;t the we&s;tern part of New-York government; depending wholly upon this place for provi&s;ions, and other &s;tores, ne|ce&s;&s;ary
<PB N="16" REF="008192_0014_102E49BCD3CB69D0">
for the undertaking. So that their whole de&s;ign, which, had they proceeded, might have proved of very bad con&s;equence to us, was at once fru&s;trated, by the very opportune reduction of this fortre&s;s. Hereby al&s;o, it is at lea&s;t probable, the enemy in &s;everal other places to the &s;outhward and we&s;tward, as well as the &s;avages in their alliance, were di&s;appointed of tho&s;e &s;upplies, which they very much needed. How favourable, therefore, was the providence, by which this fortre&s;s was reduced and di&s;mantled, if not entirely demoli&s;hed? e&s;pecially, when we add, that this was effected almo&s;t with|out the lo&s;s of any lives on our &s;ide; or, as &s;ome confidently affirm, without a &s;ingle one?</P>
<P>The&s;e, my brethren, are &s;ome of the &s;ucce&s;&s;es which, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God on his maje&s;ty's arms, we have had by land, in the cour&s;e of the year pa&s;t. As a ballance to which, the enemy can pretend to none again&s;t us; I &s;ay, as a ballance to them; for &s;ome &s;ucce&s;&s;es they have doubtle&s;s had. But they have taken none of our fortre&s;&s;es, that we know of; they have made no de&s;cents on our coa&s;ts; they have made a conque&s;t of no place; they have obtain|ed no con&s;iderable victory. Though it mu&s;t be ac|knowledged, that they repul&s;ed, by &s;ome means or other, and with lo&s;s to us, what might be looked on as a very formidable army in America, coming again&s;t them<NOTE PLACE="foot">At Lake George, near Ticonderoga.</NOTE>.

But how much &s;oever they may be di&s;po&s;ed to glory and triumph in the&s;e heroic exploits, it may be
<PB N="17" REF="008192_0015_102E49859241ACF0">
que&s;tioned whether even they could, without blu&s;h|ing, pretend to make them near equivalent to the advantages obtained again&s;t them; tho' they have foreheads, in &s;uch re&s;pects, inferior to tho&s;e of no nation under heaven.</P>
<P>BUT, if you plea&s;e, we will now take a brief view of our &s;ucce&s;&s;es by &s;ea the la&s;t year; and of what the enemy have &s;uffer'd in their naval power and commerce.</P>
<P>AND, if I mi&s;take not, it is computed that in the Mediterranean, on the coa&s;t of Africa, in the bay of Bi&s;cay, in the Engli&s;h channel, in the We&s;t-Indies, and at the &s;iege and &s;urrender of Loui&s;|bourg, the royal navy of France has &s;u&s;tained the lo&s;s of about thirty &s;hips, greater and le&s;s, the year pa&s;t: Some of them capital ones, and much the greater part of which, not having been de&s;troyed, have been added to the royal navy of Great-Britain. A heavy lo&s;s, indeed, to them, which affects them in the tendere&s;t point; and of great con&s;equence to us. And under this head of what the royal navy of France has &s;uffered, I may ju&s;t mention the capture and de&s;truction of all her armed ve&s;&s;els on lake Ontario, in the very &s;ucce&s;sful expedition again&s;t Frontinac&punc; &s;poken of above. The enemy's lo&s;s of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els of war, and with them, of their u&s;urped dominion of that lake, is not trivial to them, con&s;idering the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of their affairs in America; and e&s;pecially the importance, or rather nece&s;&s;ity, of their having a free and &s;afe communi|cation between Canada and Niagara, the Ohio, &amp;c.</P>
<P>BUT what has been already mentioned is by no means the whole, if indeed it may be ju&s;tly ac|counted
<PB N="18" REF="008192_0016_102E49BF623ED498">
the greater part, of our maritime &s;ucce&s;s, and of the enemy's lo&s;&s;es, the la&s;t year. Their pri|vate &s;hips of war, taken and de&s;troyed in this time, are va&s;tly more numerous, than tho&s;e of the king; &s;o numerous, that I cannot pretend to make any pro|bable conjecture about them.</P>
<P>AND &s;till va&s;tly more numerous than both the&s;e together, have been the captures made of the ene|my's tran&s;port, &s;tore and common merchant-&s;hips; e&s;pecially if we include tho&s;e taken and de&s;troyed in the de&s;cents made on the coa&s;t of France; in one of which only, con&s;iderably more than a hun|dred &s;ail fell into our hands; at lea&s;t, were wholly lo&s;t to the enemy.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e, almo&s;t innumerable captures, the ene|my have lo&s;t immen&s;e trea&s;ure and riches, which have been brought into Great-Britain and her colo|nies. The effects of which in France are vi&s;ible enough, in the multiplied bankruptcies of her mer|chants; in the &s;carcity of money, even in the royal funds and coffers; in the height of intere&s;t and in|&s;urance; in the &s;tagnation of trade and bu&s;ine&s;s, and in the con&s;equent di&s;content, and murmurs, and di&s;|cords of the people. The effects hereof are al&s;o apparent enough in Great-Britain, and mo&s;t of her colonies and plantations, in the wealth of her mer|chants; in the plenty of money found for public u&s;es; in the lowne&s;s of intere&s;t and in&s;urance; in the flouri&s;hing &s;tate of trade and bu&s;ine&s;s; and the con&s;equent general ea&s;ine&s;s, contentment, unanimity and &s;pirit, of the people of all ranks. It mu&s;t in &s;hort be acknowledged by all, who are not &s;ceptical to a great degree, that the commerce of France, on which depend her chief &s;trength and re&s;ources, is
<PB N="19" REF="008192_0017_102E498718E2D1B0">
reduced to a low ebb, and daily decrea&s;ing. For not being able to &s;ecure and defend her trade, it is either blocked up in port, or falls into the hands of the royal navy, and private crui&s;ers, of Great-Britain and her dependencies. On the other hand, by rea|&s;on of the great &s;uperiority of our naval power, and our late maritime &s;ucce&s;&s;es, our trade in general is in a very flouri&s;hing condition; and both the private merchant, and the public, enjoy almo&s;t all the advan|tages of a free, exten&s;ive and gainful commerce.</P>
<P>IT is not, however, pretended that Great-Bri|tain and her colonies have &s;u&s;tained no lo&s;&s;es by &s;ea the year pa&s;t, e&s;pecially of merchant-men. Many of them have fallen into the enemy's hands; and even two or three of theKing's &s;maller &s;hips, I think, have had the &s;ame de&s;tiny; which, without a mira|cle, could hardly have been otherwi&s;e. But (which is the only thing in&s;i&s;ted on, and which will not, I pre&s;ume, be denied) our maritime lo&s;&s;es &s;till bear no proportion, or but a very &s;mall one, to tho&s;e of the enemy. And it is probable that the naval pow|er of Great-Britain, and the number of her mer|chant-&s;hips, are now, both ab&s;olutely and relatively greater, than at the beginning of the year: Ab&s;o|lutely, as their &s;trength and number are increa&s;ed on the whole, in&s;tead of being le&s;&s;ened, notwith|&s;tanding her lo&s;&s;es: And relatively, as there is now a much greater di&s;proportion between her &s;hipping and navy, and that of France, than there was at that time. The latter is indi&s;putably true&punc; And the former is equally certain, at lea&s;t &s;o far as it con|cerns the royal navy.</P>
<P>FROM this cur&s;ory and imperfect review of the military events of the la&s;t year, (for it is with events
<PB N="20" REF="008192_0018_102E49C307A5AC10">
that I chiefly concern my&s;elf) it appears that God, who&s;e dominion extends equally over the mighty waters, and the dry land, has pro&s;pered the Briti&s;h arms on either element; and to &s;uch a degree, all circum&s;tances being con&s;idered, that our pro&s;pects with regard to the pre&s;ent war are now much more favourable and promi&s;ing, than they have ever before been &s;ince the commencement of it.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, we cannot &s;o well form a judgment re&s;pecting this point, con&s;idering the pre&s;ent clo&s;e connexion between the courts of London and Ber|lin, without taking into con&s;ideration the &s;ucce&s;&s;es, with which his <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">However various the opinions of people may be re&s;pecting the advantage or di&s;advantage of continental connexions, to Great-Britain; yet there is certainly one thing wherein they mu&s;t all be united: That while &s;uch connexions ac|tually &s;ub&s;i&s;t, Great-Britain is nearly concerned and inter|re&s;ted in all the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of her allies.</NOTE> Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty has been &s;avour'd the la&s;t year; which, you are &s;en&s;ible are partly the occa&s;ion of our pre&s;ent rejoicing; &s;o that in &s;peak|ing of them, I do not deviate from the proper bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the day; and therefore need make no apology.</P>
<P>INDEED if we only compared his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty's dominions, and the number of his troops, with tho&s;e of his confederated enemies, who &s;eem to have joint|ly vowed his de&s;truction, it might appear as if he had been &s;ufficiently happy and &s;ucce&s;sful, not to &s;ay triumphant, meerly by defending him&s;elf again&s;t them, and not falling, long ago, a &s;acrifice to their re&s;entment. But not &s;o, if we con&s;ider either the character of this Prince, or the righteous cau&s;e, partly the cau&s;e of religious liberty, wherein he has drawn
<PB N="21" REF="008192_0019_102E49889E52F080">
his &s;word. The&s;e things, under the providence and government of God, might &s;eem to promi&s;e other &s;ucce&s;&s;es and triumphs, than merely tho&s;e of not being &s;wallowed up &amp; de&s;troyed, even by &s;uch numerous and potent enemies. And had we formed very &s;anguine hopes of this &s;ort, we &s;ee by the event, that hea|ven would not have fru&s;trated them. For God has, in divers in&s;tances pro&s;pered the arms of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty the la&s;t year pa&s;t. To pa&s;s over his other le&s;s con&s;iderable, tho' not incon&s;iderable &s;ucce&s;&s;es, you are &s;en&s;ible he has obtain'd a very &s;ignal victory over the Ru&s;&s;ian army, much &s;uperior in number to his own, and commanded by a general, inferior, perhaps, to but few of the pre&s;ent age. This conque&s;t, according to our late&s;t accounts, was &s;o deci&s;ive and compleat, and attended with &s;uch a prodigious &s;laughter of the mercenary and uncivilized, the rapacious, bloody, and almo&s;t barbarous enemy, that it is not &s;o properly called a victory over the Ru&s;&s;ian army, as the total ruin and de&s;truction of it.</P>
<P>IN con&s;equence of this deci&s;ive victory, (if I do not &s;eem to le&s;&s;en the event by calling it by that name) his maje&s;ty [the King of Pru&s;&s;ia] was left at liberty and lei&s;ure to turn his arms again&s;t his other enemies, particularly the French and Au&s;trians; and to reinforce his generals with victorious troops, or rather with his own royal pre&s;ence, more powerful and efficacious than many thou&s;ands. His enemies &s;till remaining in the field, after this memorable &s;ucce&s;s, were indeed very numerous and powerful: Nor do we know how the year's campaign ended with this great Commander, if it be yet ended. For we are &s;peaking of a Commander, to whom all &s;ea&s;ons &s;eem to be alike, and with whom the beginning and end
<PB N="22" REF="008192_0020_102E49C69B407890">
of a year, and of a campaign, are almo&s;t the &s;ame thing. And what may not be rea&s;onably expected, at lea&s;t hoped for, from a Monarch &s;o truly <HI>Great;</HI> not by the united &s;uffrages and &s;en&s;ele&s;s adorations of 18 million &s;laves, long di&s;ciplin'd to crouch, and annihi|late them&s;elves before lawle&s;s power; but <HI>Great</HI> by his own per&s;onal actions and virtues? What may not be hoped for from One, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es almo&s;t all hu|man accompli&s;hments, e&s;pecially the virtues military and heroic, in the highe&s;t degree of perfection? What may not be hoped for from a Prince, &s;o vi&s;ibly upheld by providence, to vindicate the rights of mankind again&s;t the inva&s;ions of tyranny, and the u&s;urpations of the papal &s;ee? What, not hoped for from One, by whom heaven has, for a cour&s;e of years, not only wrought wonders, but &s;eemed to delight therein, tho' &s;till without miracle? In fine, What not hoped from a Prince, whom God &s;eems to have rai&s;ed up, on purpo&s;e that in him he <Q>might make his power known, and that his name might be declared thro|out all the earth?</Q> tho' in a far different &s;en&s;e than this is &s;aid of Pharaoh, the great Egyptian mo|narch, and oppre&s;&s;or of the people of God.&mdash;Not, that he might &s;hew his power in his down-fall and de&s;truction; but in his &s;alvation, in his victories, and triumphs over &s;uch numerous and potent enemies, leagued again&s;t him, and that righteous cau&s;e of main|taining the <Q>liberty wherewith Chri&s;t has made us free,</Q> which he has a&s;&s;erted in oppo&s;ition to an|tichri&s;tian u&s;urpation. It would have &s;ome affinity to infidelity and athei&s;m, not to hope from &s;uch a Prince, ingaged in &s;uch a cau&s;e, and hitherto &s;up|ported and &s;ucceeded by divine providence in &s;uch a wonderful manner, what it might be criminal pre|&s;umption, or at be&s;t fooli&s;h credulity, to expect from another, of different talents and de&s;igns, or to whom,

if I may &s;o expre&s;s it, God had not given &s;imilar atte&s;tations and credentials of his approbation, and pre&s;ence with him.</P>
<P>BUT not to digre&s;s too far; and to come more directly to the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day, we may ju&s;tly look upon all the &s;ucce&s;&s;es and victories of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty as our own, con&s;idering the alliance &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ing between our own Sovereign and him, and one common cau&s;e (tho' not the only) wherein they have un&s;heathed the &s;word. The advantage is truly ours, for this good rea&s;on; his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty's enemies are, in effect, ours. But tho' the benefit redound to us in part, the honour is his own; or rather it be|longs to God, who&s;e is the <Q>victory and the maje&s;ty.</Q> However, the more Heaven favours the de&s;igns and enterprizes of this illu&s;trious Prince, the more cau&s;e of thankfulne&s;s we have; and the better pro&s;pect of &s;eeing the pre&s;ent war brought to a happy conclu&s;ion. And if the &s;ame right hand of the Mo&s;t High, which has hitherto been revealed, and made manife&s;t in his protection and conque&s;ts, &s;hould &s;till be made bare for him; and unle&s;s affairs &s;hould take a very different turn from the pre&s;ent, with re&s;pect to the Briti&s;h councils and arms, we may, I humbly conceive, after another campaign, rationally hope for peace with France on more advantageous terms than we have long enjoyed it, even than we had it by the treaty of Utrecht.</P>
<P>BUT &s;till I mu&s;t remind you, tho' you are pro|bably aware of it, that there is almo&s;t infinite uncertainty in all judgments formed on &s;uch-like matters, tho' formed on pre&s;ent appearances. They are grounded at bottom on precarious hypothe&s;es; on &s;uppo&s;itions that &s;ome things will continue as
<PB N="24" REF="008192_0022_102E49C81F20EAF8">
they are, or have been, without any material alte|ration; or that they will be &s;o and &s;o; which things being quite contingent as to us&punc; all opinions grounded on them, e&s;pecially re&s;pecting remote events, mu&s;t of con&s;equence be infinitely precarious, amounting to &s;carce more than conjectures, or gue&s;&s;es in the dark. Many things may intervene, before the con|clu&s;ion of a peace, which may put another face on affairs, and intirely fru&s;trate our hopes re&s;pecting it, tho' they &s;hould not be wholly without foundation. There may po&s;&s;ibly be a &s;udden change in the ad|mini&s;tration, as much for the wor&s;e, as a late one was for the better; than which there can &s;carce be a greater or more apparent. The Spaniard may quite for&s;ake his nutrality, of which, by &s;ome things, he has indeed &s;eemed a little weary already. Our old money-loving friends, the Dutch, may perhaps act more openly and avowedly again&s;t us, tho' they cannot do it more really than they have long done, by &s;upplying our French enemies with provi&s;ions and military &s;tores, and treacherou&s;ly carrying on their trade for them, in their own bottoms and names: Or other nations may ri&s;e up again&s;t us, and join our enemies. Famine, or pe&s;tilence, or both, may be &s;ent to &s;courge us. Our fleets and navies may &s;uffer &s;hipwreck in a &s;torm of God's indignation, like the formidable Armada. Our armies may be wa&s;ted with mortal di&s;ea&s;e; and become le&s;s terrible to the enemy, in re&s;pect of their &s;trength and valor, than of the con|tagion attending them: Or they may po&s;&s;ibly, here|after, have traiterous, weak, or pu&s;illanimous com|manders; by who&s;e authority, enforced by the mo&s;t powerful motive, their own example, they may "flee when no man pur&s;ueth them". I &s;ay, there is a po&s;&s;ibility of this, hereafter; for it might per|haps give offence to &s;ome, if I &s;aid that any thing

&s;imilar to it had actually happened during the pre|&s;ent war. But I cannot but ju&s;t mention it as an happy omen, that there is a gentleman <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">His Excellency Major General Amher&s;t.</NOTE> appointed to the chief military command here in America, the chief &s;eat and object of the pre&s;ent war, who&s;e mili|tary qualifications and character are &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;h|ed; partly, by his prudent and &s;ucce&s;sful conduct in the late &s;iege of Louisbourg. Nor would you, I am per&s;uaded, think me enthu&s;ia&s;tic, if I added&mdash;a gentleman who, as fame reports, has merited, and thereby had an opportunity of improving in the art of war, under the heroe and wonder of his age, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia: For who can help conceiving the highe&s;t expectations from a great military genius, cultivated in the &s;chool, and amid &s;cenes of war, under a ma&s;ter, on who&s;e &s;tandards victory has been &s;o long accu&s;tomed to wait? However,</P>

And now, leaving future events with Him, who only knows, as He only determines them; and acknowledging with gra|titude what he has already done for us, re&s;pecting the pre&s;ent war; let us proceed, according to the method propo&s;ed under the fir&s;t general head of di&s;cour&s;e,</P>
<P N="3">3dly and la&s;tly, TO mention very briefly, tho&s;e mercies and ble&s;&s;ings which relate more particularly to this province; the fruitfulne&s;s of the pa&s;t &s;ea&s;on; the general plenty and health, with which we have been favour'd. For, as it is expre&s;&s;ed in his Excellency's

<P>THE country, (I mean in contradi&s;tinction from the maritime towns, and particularly from this capital) The country, I &s;ay, has not only been &s;upplied, but even enriched, by the plentiful pro|duce of this year. It has enjoyed an abundance with|in it&s;elf; which, at the &s;ame time, has overflowed to di&s;tant places. Great quantities of provi&s;ions have been &s;ent to his Maje&s;ty's fleet and armies: by which
<PB N="27" REF="008192_0025_102E4992A349C870">
means, we have not only been enabled to help for|ward the military operations, and common cau&s;e, in which we have a very particular intere&s;t; but con|&s;iderable wealth has been brought into the country; I might properly &s;ay, into the community. Becau&s;e this is really a common benefit; e&s;pecially in a time of war, a proportionable part of the expence of which we ought doubtle&s;s to bear, and have always, to &s;ay the lea&s;t, done that. For this purpo&s;e, to &s;ay nothing of any others, monies mu&s;t be levied and rai&s;ed from time to time; and what is brought in by the exports of the country's produce, will of cour&s;e circulate; at lea&s;t a con&s;iderable part thereof, however de&s;irous many individuals may be of hoard|ing. In this re&s;pect, a plentiful produce of the earth ought to be accounted a common benefit. Be&s;ides; this of cour&s;e cau&s;eth a plenty, not only of bread, the &s;taff of life; but al&s;o of animal food, and many other things to the advantage of all in general, and not only of the husbandman. For tho' the hus|bandman primarily reaps the benefit hereof, and perhaps principally; yet you know that all others, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, are <Q>&s;erved by the field.</Q> The citizen, the merchant and trade&s;man, all find the advantage of a plentiful &s;ea&s;on, in the proportionably lower price of provi&s;ions, and the nece&s;&s;aries of life. This is at lea&s;t generally, if not univer&s;ally, true. For tho' the maritime towns, and this in particular, have not, perhaps, &s;o fully and clearly perceived this advantage of the la&s;t year's plenty, by rea&s;on of the great exports; yet a little reflection would &s;how them, that under the like peculiar circum&s;tances calling for &s;uch exportation, a year of &s;carcity mu&s;t needs have rai&s;ed the ne|ce&s;&s;aries of life to a price, far beyond what they have been at the &s;ummer pa&s;t, or are at pre&s;ent. So that
<PB N="28" REF="008192_0026_102E49CC7A274888">
it is certain, whether they clearly &s;ee it or not, that they actually reap the mentioned advantage of a plentiful produce; tho' probably, not in &s;o great a degree as the husbandman. All of us therefore, without exception, are bound in rea&s;on to acknow|ledge the goodne&s;s of God to us in this re&s;pect.</P>
<P>AS to the general health enjoyed thro' the pro|vince; this is &s;o evident, and &s;o manife&s;tly a great ble&s;&s;ing, that it were needle&s;s to enlarge upon it.

<P>Enter into his gates with thank&s;giving, and into his courts with prai&s;e: be thankful unto him, and ble&s;s his name.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the morning I recounted to you, as particu|larly as the time would well admit, tho&s;e mer|cies and ble&s;&s;ings, on account of which we this day enter into the courts of our God with prai&s;e. The&s;e mercies were con&s;idered in the order follow|ing; <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>FIRST, Tho&s;e which relate to the civil &s;tate of the nation in general.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="008192_0029_102E4998CFB316B8">THEN, Tho&s;e which relate particularly to the war; or the &s;ucce&s;&s;es granted, the la&s;t year, to his Maje&s;ty's arms, and al&s;o to the Pru&s;&s;ian:</P>
<P>AND LASTLY, Tho&s;e mercies which relate more particularly to this Province; as the uncommon fruitfulne&s;s of the pa&s;t &s;ea&s;on, and the general plen|ty and health, with which we have been favour'd.</P>
<P>IT doubtle&s;s becomes us to make a grateful re|turn to almighty God for the&s;e great and mani|fold expre&s;&s;ions of his loving-kindne&s;s: It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, and <Q>prai&s;e is comely for the upright.</Q></P>
<P>I AM now therefore, in the &s;econd place, by divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and according to the method propo&s;ed,</P>
<P N="2">II. TO explain, and inculcate upon you, the du|ty of religious thankfulne&s;s for the mercies which have been repre&s;ented to you. And this pre&s;up|po&s;es and implies in it various things; more e&s;pe|cially the&s;e which follow;</P>
<P>THAT we have a proper &s;en&s;e of their greatne&s;s and importance, con&s;idered in them&s;elves;</P>
<P>THAT we acknowledge God, who ruleth in the kingdom of men, and who&s;e providence governs all things, as the author of them:</P>
<P>THAT we are &s;en&s;ible, they were unde&s;erved by us, and therefore flow from His mere favour, or free grace:</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="008192_0030_102E49D30894DA88">THAT our hearts are rai&s;ed up to God, on ac|count of them, in the exerci&s;e of devout affection, or internal ble&s;&s;ing and prai&s;e: And la&s;tly,</P>
<P>THAT we expre&s;s the&s;e grateful &s;entiments of our hearts, by the external acts of ble&s;&s;ing the name of the Lord, and &s;inging his prai&s;es.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. RELIGIOUS thankfulne&s;s for the&s;e mercies, &s;uppo&s;es that we have &s;ome proper &s;en&s;e of their greatne&s;s and importance, con&s;idered in them&s;elves. As no per&s;on can, in the nature of the thing, be thankful, or even joyful, on account of what he does not e&s;teem as a real good, or benefit; &s;o nei|ther can any one be thankful or joyful to the degree which he ought to be, unle&s;s his &s;en&s;e and e&s;teem of the &s;uppo&s;ed benefit ari&s;es in proportion to the greatne&s;s, or is adequate to the true nature thereof. As far as he undervalues any ble&s;&s;ing; as much as his e&s;teem thereof falls &s;hort of being commen&s;u|rate to its proper worth; &s;o far he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily fall &s;hort of that gratitude which he owes to his benefactor. For that good which is not perceived by us is, to us, as nothing, however great it may be &s;uppo&s;ed in it&s;elf. And of con&s;equence, the author of it will be defrauded, in part at lea&s;t, of tho&s;e grateful returns from us, which are due to him. This will hold equally true, whether we &s;peak of an human, or of our Divine benefactor.</P>
<P>YOU ought therefore, my brethren, &s;eriou&s;ly to revolve in your minds the &s;everal benefits and ble&s;|&s;ings which have been enumerated to you; to con&s;ider how manifold, how great, they are; and to gain a proper idea of their value. Without
<PB N="33" REF="008192_0031_102E499A53B808E0">
thus meditating upon them, till you perceive their true worth and importance, you will at be&s;t only offer the &s;acrifice of a crude, unruminated prai&s;e; at lea&s;t as unworthy as "the lame or the blind." And in order to your having a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the greatne&s;s and value of the&s;e mercies, one of the mo&s;t certain and effectual ways will be, to reflect how unhappy we &s;hould have been without them; or if in&s;tead of enjoying them, the contrary evils had befallen us. Con&s;ider, for example, how mi|&s;erable we &s;hould have been, if in&s;tead of having the life of a good prote&s;tant King pre&s;erved to us; if in&s;tead of having the Briti&s;h laws and govern|ment, and our civil and religious liberties, conti|nued as they are; that good King had been taken away, and a bad one &s;ucceeded him; (e&s;pecially the wor&s;t, a thorough Roman-catholic, who&s;e evil con&s;cience, whatever he might &s;wear to the <HI>contrary,</HI> would &s;till oblige him to di&s;tre&s;s, if not to de&s;troy, his prote&s;tant &s;ubjects &mdash; for the good of their &s;ouls!) if the free and happy government of Great-Britain had been overturned, and arbitrary &s;way, and papal tyranny, had been e&s;tabli&s;hed in its room. Had this been the ca&s;e, you mu&s;t needs be &s;en&s;ible how wretched we &s;hould have been. And this reflection will help you to form a ju&s;t idea of the greatne&s;s of the beforementioned ble&s;|&s;ings, which are &s;till continued to us; and of the future enjoyment of which, we have &s;o favour|able a pro&s;pect in his Maje&s;ty's royal Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>AGAIN: If we had obtained none of tho&s;e mili|tary &s;ucce&s;&s;es by &s;ea or land, which have been enu|merated; but the&s;e advantages had all been on the &s;ide of our enemies; if the enemy had made &s;eve|ral &s;ucce&s;sful de&s;cents on Britain, and taken divers
<PB N="34" REF="008192_0032_102E49D491314E60">
of our fortre&s;&s;es; if our magazines had been de|&s;troyed with prodigious &s;tores; had we lo&s;t one of our valuable &s;ettlements, and &s;ome place of as much importance to us, as Loui&s;bourg was to France; had his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty been &s;wallowed up, in&s;tead of being victorious; had our marine &s;uffered as much as the enemy's has done; had the royal navy of Britain &s;u&s;tained &s;o great a lo&s;s; had her private &s;hips of war been taken and de&s;troyed in &s;uch numbers; had her merchant-&s;hips been de|&s;troyed by the &s;core, or the hundred, in her ports, and &s;uch va&s;t numbers be&s;ides, taken in different parts of the world; had &s;uch immen&s;e trea&s;ure been ta|ken from her, as &s;he has taken from the enemy; were near twenty thou&s;and of her &s;eamen pri&s;oners, without any pro&s;pect of a &s;peedy redemption; in fine, had her commerce been almo&s;t ruined, and that of France in the &s;ame flouri&s;hing con|dition with ours; if the&s;e events had taken place, I &s;ay, &s;urely you cannot be in&s;en&s;ible of the melan|cholly, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation we &s;hould now have been in; and con&s;equently, cannot but &s;ee what a great mercy it is to us, that things have been o|therwi&s;e ordered; and that the Briti&s;h arms have been pro&s;pered to the degree they have.</P>
<P>AGAIN: If in&s;tead of &s;o fruitful a &s;ea&s;on as the pa&s;t, this had been a year of drought; if in&s;tead of the great plenty of mo&s;t of the nece&s;&s;aries of life among us, there had been &s;carcity and famine; if in&s;tead of the general health enjoyed, pe&s;tilence, or other mortal di&s;ea&s;es had prevailed; if the&s;e events had taken place, I need not &s;ay, but only leave you to judge, how unhappy our condition had been. Which reflection, will at the &s;ame time &s;hew you, how great the beforementioned ble&s;&s;ings are; which
<PB N="35" REF="008192_0033_102E499BD75A9F58">
is the fir&s;t thing nece&s;&s;ary in order to your being duly thankful for them.</P>
<P>NOW it is plain, that we might have been left de&s;titute of all the mercies which we have enjoyed; and not only &s;o, but have experienced all the evils and calamities which are the rever&s;e of them. And the ultimate, if not the only rea&s;on, which can be a&s;&s;igned why the&s;e evils, in&s;tead of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, have not come upon us and the nation, is, be|cau&s;e God was plea&s;ed to order events to be as they are. Which brings me to the &s;econd particular mentioned above; namely,</P>
<P N="2">2dly. THAT in order to our being religiou&s;ly thankful for the&s;e great ble&s;&s;ings, we mu&s;t be &s;en&s;i|ble that they are be&s;towed on us by God, who ru|leth in the kingdom of men, and who&s;e providence &s;uperintends all things. That gratitude which is properly called religious, has God alone for its ob|ject, and terminates on him in di&s;tinction from all means and in&s;truments, as the &s;upreme Author of the good, for which we are thankful. It implies a contradiction to &s;uppo&s;e, that we can be duly thankful for any ble&s;&s;ings we enjoy, unle&s;s we firm|ly believe the over-ruling providence of God, by which events are brought to pa&s;s; and unle&s;s, in our thoughts, we refer them ultimately to him. Nor, indeed, is there any rea&s;on why we &s;hould be thankful to him, even for the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings we enjoy, on any other &s;uppo&s;ition than this, that his kingdom ruleth over all; that he is truly and pro|perly the author of the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings. If he were not, you would be under no more obligation to be thank|ful for them to Jehovah, than to the Aegyptian bull, or the golden calves &s;et up in Dan and Bethel. All religious gratitude &s;uppo&s;es in the very notion
<PB N="36" REF="008192_0034_102E49D9689DEF18">
of it, that the good for which we are thankful, is the effect of God's goodne&s;s and power, and that it accrues to us by the di&s;po&s;itions of his providence. From hence it is apparent, that tho' you have ever &s;o ju&s;t and thorough a &s;en&s;e of the value of tho&s;e mercies which have been repre&s;ented to you; yet unle&s;s you are fully per&s;uaded that God governs the world, and all things that are therein, and that he has be&s;towed the&s;e mercies on us, you can, in no proper &s;en&s;e, be thankful to him for them. You may indeed, without this, be glad, and heartily re|joiced on account of them, or thankful to tho&s;e per&s;ons who have been in&s;trumental of good to the public, wherein you have a &s;hare: But neither of the&s;e things is religious gratitude; neither thankful|ne&s;s to man, nor joy on account of any pro&s;perous events; tho' the former of them may, and the lat|ter of them nece&s;&s;arily mu&s;t, attend it.</P>
<P>BUT not to digre&s;s: Let me inculcate it upon you as a mo&s;t certain truth, demon&s;trable, if any thing is &s;o, by human rea&s;on, as well as the plain doctrine of divine revelation, and a truth which &s;hould ever be in our thoughts; that this world is under the government, not of blind chance, or fate, or men, or good, or evil &s;pirits; but of that eternal, infinite, and omnipre&s;ent Spirit, to whom it owes its exi&s;tence. It is God's world; he upholds, he rules, he controuls it, and in &s;ome way or other, perhaps inconceivable by us, actually orders and determines the events of it; and that with &s;uch preci&s;ion, that neither a "&s;parrow falls to the ground, nor a "lot is ca&s;t into the lap," without him. All &s;ubordinate beings or agents, who are concerned in bringing about any events, any changes or revolutions in this lower world, whether pro&s;|perous or adver&s;e to us, are his agents, his in&s;tru|ments,
<PB N="37" REF="008192_0035_102E499D60710208">
all "fulfilling his plea&s;ure." He is there|fore to be acknowledged as the &s;upreme, ultimate cau&s;e of all the&s;e events. By him, his power and wi&s;dom, kings reign, and princes decree ju&s;tice: He pulleth down one kingdom, and &s;etteth up another. The hor&s;e is prepared for the battle, but &s;afety is of the Lord. He giveth rain from heaven, and fruitful &s;ea&s;ons, filling our hearts with food and gladne&s;s. &mdash; <Q>Thine, O Lord, is the greatne&s;s, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the maje&s;ty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou art exalted as head above all. Both riches and honor come of thee, and thou reigne&s;t over all, and in thine hand is power and might, and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give &s;trength unto all.</Q> Unle&s;s we &s;in|cerely a&s;&s;ent to the truth and propriety of the&s;e words of in&s;piration, we cannot, whatever ble&s;&s;ings we enjoy, properly adopt tho&s;e which immediately follow, &mdash; "Now <HI>therefore,</HI> our God, we <HI>thank Thee,</HI> and prai&s;e thy glorious name<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Chron. 29.11, 12, 13.</NOTE>." It is mere trifling and impertinence, not piety in us, to ap|pear in this place upon this occa&s;ion, unle&s;s we firmly believe the governing providence of God, according to the repre&s;entations of &s;cripture: be|cau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible we &s;hould be religiou&s;ly thank|ful for the mercies we enjoy, however great they are in them&s;elves, without thus referring them all to Him, "of whom, and thro' whom, and to whom are all things." But</P>
<P N="3">3dly, IT is requi&s;ite in order to our being duly thankful for the&s;e mercies, that we are &s;en&s;ible we were unde&s;erving of them, and con&s;equently that they flow from the free grace, and mere bounty of God towards us. And indeed, if you con&s;ider
<PB N="38" REF="008192_0036_102E49DD0739BB40">
the matter with any attention, you will perceive that gratitude, whether to God, or any other be|ing, in the very nature of it, &s;uppo&s;es him to have done a favour to us, &s;ome act of kindne&s;s or grace, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from ju&s;tice. For we cannot, pro|perly &s;peaking, thank any one for doing an act of mere ju&s;tice, however advantageous it may be to us; or be thankful to him any farther than he has dealt by us in a way of bounty, and done what, in point of mere equity, he was under no obliga|tion to do. Thus far, and only thus far, we may, in propriety of language, be thankful. So that it is not &s;ufficient for us to acknowledgeGod as the real, &s;upreme author of the before mentioned ble&s;&s;ings, in order to our being grateful to him; it is more|over nece&s;&s;ary that we are &s;en&s;ible, they flow from his bounty; that we had no claim to them, founded in righteou&s;ne&s;s and equity, but that they might have been with held from us without injury or inju&s;tice. And that this is true in fact, cannot be denied on the principles of religion, or even on tho&s;e of rea&s;on and common &s;en&s;e: <Q>For who hath fir&s;t given unto him? and it &s;hall be re|compen&s;ed to him again.</Q> Not even the inno|cent and holy angels of heaven have done &s;o; and therefore, are under obligation to thank God for their being, and all the happy circum&s;tances that have attended it from fir&s;t to la&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT WE are in a further and higher &s;en&s;e obliged to acknowledge that all the ble&s;&s;ings we enjoy, flow from God's free Grace, or unde&s;erved good|ne&s;s. For we have not only, not merited them by any thing we have done; but were obnoxious to his ju&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure, and the effects thereof, by &s;in|ning again&s;t him. So that he might in perfect con|&s;i&s;tence with equity, not only have withheld all
<PB N="39" REF="008192_0037_102E49A1FA2E1AA0">
the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings from us, but vi&s;ited our iniquities with all the oppo&s;ite evils; yea, with far more terrible ones, not only in this world, but in ano|ther. Surely, neither we, nor the nation in gene|ral, are &s;o righteous before God, that he was bound in ju&s;tice to confer the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings on us: Would to him! we were not &s;o unrighteous, that he might, without any imputation on the equity of his providence, have brought on us the mo&s;t grie|vous calamities, as he might unque&s;tionably have done. Since, therefore, God has not dealt with us according to our &s;ins, nor rewarded us according to our iniquities; but be&s;towed on us &s;o many in|valuable mercies, we are obliged in all &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on to own, that they are the effects of his mere grace and favour. Nor is it po&s;&s;ible we &s;hould be duly thankful to him for the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, as &s;in|ful creatures ought to be, without taking into con|&s;ideration our unworthine&s;s of them. And in pro|portion to the &s;en&s;e we have of our unworthine&s;s, and the grace of God in conferring any mercies on us, will ordinarily at lea&s;t be the degree of our gra|titude to him.</P>
<P>LET me therefore, as a nece&s;&s;ary means of rai&s;ing your gratitude to a due height, and pro|per fervour, exhort you to reflect &s;eriou&s;ly on your own &s;ins in particular, on the &s;ins of this land, and of the nation in general; or the im|piety and infidelity, the prophanene&s;s and &s;en|&s;uality, the pride and luxury, the &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and venality, the inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion, which have been in the mid&s;t of us. Without this, tho' you may po&s;&s;ibly have a deep &s;en&s;e of the worth and importance of the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, and may firmly be|lieve that God is the author of them, yet you can|not
<PB N="40" REF="008192_0038_102E49DE8E697FB8">
be &s;o thoroughly thankful for them as you ought to be; not having a ju&s;t idea of our unwor|thine&s;s of them, and of the goodne&s;s and grace of God in be&s;towing them. But &s;uch reflexions will have the mo&s;t direct, and, by God's ble&s;&s;ing, an effectual tendency, to awaken in you the warme&s;t &s;entiments of gratitude to him. I &s;ay, the warme&s;t &s;entiments of gratitude to him: for you are to re|member, that religious thankfulne&s;s does not con&s;i&s;t merely in &s;peculation; in having right notions and conceptions of the ble&s;&s;ings we enjoy, of their great|ne&s;s and value, of our unworthine&s;s of them, and the mercy of God in be&s;towing them; but in corre&s;pon|ding operations of the heart and mind towards our almighty, and mo&s;t gracious Benefactor. This intro|duces the fourth particular mentioned above, <HI>viz&punc;</HI></P>
<P N="4">4thly. THAT religious thankfulne&s;s implies in it the exerci&s;e of devout affection towards God, or the internal acts of ble&s;&s;ing and prai&s;ing him for his goodne&s;s. Hereby it is intended to a&s;certain the true and proper nature of religious gratitude, by di&s;tin|gui&s;hing it from two things, which may po&s;&s;ibly be mi&s;taken for it. Fir&s;t, from the mere &s;en&s;ation of joy, or gladne&s;s of heart, on account of the ble&s;&s;ings which we enjoy. This is common to good and bad men; athei&s;ts them&s;elves may po&s;&s;ibly rejoice even more than the mo&s;t pious men, in having the means of worldly and temporal happine&s;s; becau&s;e their only portion being in this world, they of con&s;e|quence &s;et an higher value on the&s;e worldly goods than they, who&s;e chief trea&s;ure, and who&s;e hearts are in heaven. Religious gratitude is quite a dif|ferent thing from this joy and rejoicing, which ter|minate in the good things po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, or enjoyed by us. God, as was ob&s;erved above, is the object
<PB N="41" REF="008192_0039_102E49E012CF6248">
thereof; and it con&s;i&s;ts in devout affection towards him; in the emotions of the heart, in ble&s;&s;ing and prai&s;ing him, as the author of the&s;e benefits. And both the&s;e things together, I mean the perception of good, in conjunction with the internal act of ble&s;&s;ing God as the giver of it, make up the true &s;cripture idea of "rejoicing in the Lord." But by the definition above, religious thankfulne&s;s is di&s;tingui&s;hed, not only from the mere &s;en&s;ation of joy on account of the ble&s;&s;ings received; but al&s;o from a mere &s;peculative notion in the head, and all the operations of that which is peculiarly and &s;trictly called, the intellectual or rational faculty in man; the heart or affections, as di&s;tingui&s;hed there|from, being the proper &s;eat of it.</P>
<P>SOME may perhaps think this, at be&s;t, a need|le&s;s refining, if not an unintelligible &s;ubtlety, or un|meaning di&s;tinction, like many others which, fir&s;t and la&s;t, have darkened religion, under the pretence of explaining it. For it may be a&s;ked, if a man is fully &s;en&s;ible of the worth of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings which he enjoys; if he is fully per&s;waded that God is the author of them; if he knows his unworthine&s;s of them, and therefore is rationally convinced that they flow from the divine grace and bounty, is he not therefore truly thankful to God for them? What is there &s;till wanting to make him religiou&s;ly thankful? I an&s;wer, nothing&mdash;but the thing it&s;elf; that which is the very e&s;&s;ence and &s;ub&s;tance of this duty, or virtue: &s;uch a man has all tho&s;e ju&s;t and rational conceptions of things, which are nece&s;&s;ary in order to his being duly thankful, and are a pro|per foundation for the exerci&s;e of gratitude towards God. But &s;till no opinion, no judgment which the mind, or rational faculty, forms concerning the
<PB N="42" REF="008192_0040_102E49E2ECDD4290">
goodne&s;s and mercy of God, however true and ju&s;t, is it&s;elf religious thankfulne&s;s. That con&s;i&s;ts, as before ob&s;erved, in certain operations of the heart, corre&s;ponding to the&s;e rational and ju&s;t conceptions of the head, or intellectual faculty; in devout and warm affection, a&s;cending to God like incen&s;e from the altar, in an internal a&s;cription of ble&s;&s;ing and prai&s;e to him on account of tho&s;e mercies, for which a man was before convinced by his rea&s;on, that he was indebted to the divine goodne&s;s and grace.</P>
<P>THAT religious gratitude implies &s;uch affection of the heart, di&s;tinct from all the operations or judg|ments of the intellectual faculty, will appear no my&s;tery, but plain truth, if you only reflect on what pa&s;&s;es in your mind when a friend has laid him&s;elf out to &s;erve you, and obliged you in a high degree. On &s;uch occa&s;ions you find in your&s;elves, not a mere cold a&s;&s;ent of the mind to the truth of the fact, that your friend has done thus; but a warm affection towards him as your benefactor, in con&s;equence of your knowing that he is &s;o; re&s;ult|ing from that knowledge, or the &s;en&s;e you have of what he has done for you, and therefore di&s;tinct from it. This will hold equally good, if applied to the ca&s;e in hand. For religious gratitude&punc; and gratitude to a friend, do not differ in the nature, but only in re&s;pect of the object, or the degree of them. The object of one is man; the object of the other is God; both of them pre&s;uppo&s;e a knowledge, or &s;en&s;e of favours received, or &s;ome obligation laid upon us. And if we are as &s;incerely thankful to God, as we u&s;ually are to a generous benefactor, we &s;hall experience as much warmth of affection towards him, in the in|ward return of ble&s;&s;ing and prai&s;e; or rather, abun|dantly

more, in proportion to his greater bounty, and the &s;uperior value of the ble&s;&s;ings which he be&s;tows upon us.</P>
<P>IMAGINE not, therefore, my Brethren, that you are this day properly thankful to God for his ma|nifold mercies, merely becau&s;e you highly e&s;teem, and are rejoiced on account of them; nor yet, merely becau&s;e you are rationally convinced of your unwor|thine&s;s of them, and that they flow from the free grace, or unmerited goodne&s;s of God. All this you may be &s;en&s;ible of, and yet have an ungrateful heart; one that is a &s;tranger to all devout affection, to all the internal acts of prai&s;ing and ble&s;&s;ing God, from whom cometh down every good and perfect gift. Nor is this only po&s;&s;ible; it may be ju&s;tly feared that many who have ju&s;t &s;peculative notions concern|ing the divine goodne&s;s, agreeably to what has been &s;aid above, are neverthele&s;s actually de&s;titute of thankful hearts; as di&s;titute perhaps, almo&s;t, as mere &s;ceptics or athei&s;ts. God forbid, there &s;hould be in any of us, an heart &s;o evil; for it is mentioned as one of the blacke&s;t &s;ins even of the heathen, whom God had not laid under &s;o many obligations as he has us, that <Q>when they knew God, they glo|rified him not as God, <HI>neither were thankful.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. I. 21.</NOTE></Q> But if you are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of truly grateful hearts for the ble&s;&s;ings conferred on you, be a&s;&s;ured that this is, in God's account, <Q>more than all whole burnt offer|ings and &s;acrifices</Q>, or <Q>the cattle upon a thou|&s;and hills.</Q> But</P>
<P N="5">5thly. THO' the heart is what is to be primarily and chiefly regarded, our gratitude ought, &s;ome|times at lea&s;t, to be expre&s;&s;ed in the outward exer|ci&s;es

of piety; in extolling the name of God, and &s;inging his prai&s;es; and this, in a public, &s;ocial manner agreeably to the text: <Q>Enter into his gates with thank&s;giving, and into his courts with prai&s;e; be thankful unto him, and ble&s;s his name.</Q> How|ever, it may be taken for granted, that tho&s;e of you who are here pre&s;ent on this joyful occa&s;ion, do not need any arguments to convince you of the propriety hereof, tho' it is probable that many others need them.

<P>BUT there is one thing more, which it will not be ami&s;s ju&s;t to remind you of, before we proceed to the la&s;t general head of di&s;cour&s;e. As all the ble&s;&s;ings which God be&s;tows on the &s;inful children of men, whether temporal or &s;piritual, are be&s;towed on the gracious plan of evangelical grace, thro' the great <Q>mediator between God and men, the man Chri&s;t Je&s;us;</Q> and as all our prayers are to be offered up to God in his name, in order to their acceptance; &s;o al&s;o ought all our thanks and prai&s;es for ble&s;&s;ings received, to be rendered thro' him, to the "One God and Father of all"; in conformity to the apo&s;tolic direction &amp; admonition;&mdash; <Q>Singing and mak|ing melody in your heart to the Lord, giving thanks always for all things unto God and [or even] the Father, <HI>in the name of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eph.

<P N="3">III. LET me now, as was propo&s;ed in the la&s;t place, exhort you to live an&s;werably to the obli|gations which God has laid us under, by be&s;towing the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings upon us. For &s;urely you cannot &s;up|po&s;e, we &s;hall have balanced our accounts with him, or

made him all the returns which his manifold goodne&s;s and mercies claim from us, only by the religious ob|&s;ervation, and the thank&s;givings of this day; even tho' we &s;hould not be deficient in any of the duties of it, whether internal or external, private or public. If we are properly thankful, and give to God this day "the glory due unto his name", thus far it is well; much better, I fear, than &s;ome, and per|haps than mo&s;t of us, can pretend to have done. But however this may be, &s;till you are to remember, that all the ble&s;&s;ings which we receive from God, not only demand our thanks and prai&s;es for the pre|&s;ent; but are an additional obligation laid upon us to do, what we were all obliged to do before; I mean, to devote our whole lives to his &s;ervice and glory. Since therefore he has thus <Q>crowned us with his loving-kindne&s;s and tender mercies,</Q> we &s;hall be doubly criminal if we do not keep his com|mandments; our &s;ins will be aggravated to a great degree. We &s;hould have been really without excu&s;e in living wickedly, tho' God had be&s;towed none of the&s;e mercies upon us: For no &s;in whatever does, in the nature of it, admit of any excu&s;e, properly &s;peaking, tho' it may be attended &s;ometimes with certain alleviating circum&s;tances. But our guilt is greatly enhanced, when our &s;ins are committed under the di&s;tingui&s;hing &s;miles of heaven; undet many and great expre&s;&s;ions of God's goodne&s;s to us, and ma|nife&s;tations of his concern both for our temporal and &s;piritual welfare; &s;uch as we have been con&s;idering.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e are de&s;igned, either to lead &s;inners to repentance, or to excite good men to greater fidelity and diligence in the &s;ervice of God. If therefore there are any pre&s;ent, who have hitherto lived in the violation of his holy commandments, let me admoni&s;h

<P>BUT there are divers things, of which I would more particularly remind you all in common, taking occa&s;ion for it from the particular nature of tho&s;e mercies and ble&s;&s;ings, which were repre&s;ented to you in the morning under &s;everal heads. Each of the&s;e will afford &s;ome remarks and reflections, mo&s;t or all of which, will tend to promote chri&s;tian piety and virtue. Let us begin</P>
<P N="1">1. WITH the mercies &s;poken of under the fir&s;t head; &s;uch as the pre&s;ervation of the life of our gracious King, and of the Briti&s;h government, of our civil and religious liberties, &amp;c. The con&s;ideration of which ble&s;&s;ings, naturally &s;ugge&s;ts the following re|flections. It may &s;erve to remind us, in the fir&s;t place, of the duty of loyalty, and of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to that government under which we have the happine&s;s to live; not only of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the government e&s;tabli&s;hed, in general, but to <Q>every ordinance of man, for the Lord's &s;ake: Whether it be to the King as &s;upreme; or unto Governors, as unto them that are &s;ent by him for the puni&s;hment of evil-doers, and for a prai&s;e to them that do well<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. II. 13, 14.</NOTE>.</Q> Surely it becomes us, as we may well do under &s;o excellent a form of government, and under the
<PB N="48" REF="008192_0046_102E49F4C1FE2D78">
reign of &s;o good a King, to <Q>lead quiet and peace|able lives;</Q> to obey the laws, and all the legal commands of our civil rulers, not being &s;inful. It would be very incon&s;i&s;tent and incongruous for us, who pretend to be thankful for the above-mentioned ble&s;&s;ings&punc; to be turbulent, or &s;editious, or bad &s;ubjects in any re&s;pect. Yea, it would be highly criminal, not in us only, but in any other per&s;ons, who have the happine&s;s of living under &s;uch a free, mild go|vernment as the Briti&s;h, and a King, with whom the laws are &s;o &s;acred as they have ever been with his pre&s;ent maje&s;ty, either to rai&s;e or countenance any kind of rebellion, or &s;edition in the &s;tate. It be|comes us all in general to be, not only peaceable, and content with the privileges we enjoy, but thank|ful for them; to honour the king and pray for him, and for the continuance of &s;o good a government.</P>
<P>ANOTHER reflection, no le&s;s naturally ari&s;ing here, is, that the privileges we enjoy under the Briti&s;h go|vernment, being &s;o precious and invaluable, we are bound in rea&s;on and duty, if there &s;hould ever be occa&s;ion, to &s;tand up in the defence of them again&s;t any illegal encroachments or u&s;urpations, whether as to things &s;piritual or temporal: For our legal privi|leges extend to both. It would be highly criminal in us tamely to &s;uffer them to be wre&s;ted from us, if it was in our power to prevent it; or to give place, even "for an hour", to them who &s;hould have the hardne&s;s to attempt it. This would infer a contempt of God's goodne&s;s in giving, and pre&s;erving to us, the&s;e privileges, amid&s;t &s;o many perils and dangers as they have been in, fir&s;t and la&s;t; particularly un|der &s;everal inglorious, not to &s;ay infamous reigns of the Stewarts. In &s;hort, we cannot be true, hearty friends to the free Engli&s;h government, to the princi|ples

of the revolution, to the pre&s;ent Royal Family, or to the prote&s;tant religion, without dete&s;ting tyran|ny; and oppo&s;ing in our &s;everal places, and to the utmo&s;t of our power, if ever there &s;hould be occa|&s;ion given for it, all arbitrary, illegal proceedings, whether in church or &s;tate, whether of great men or little ones. This is &s;carce le&s;s the duty of every Briti&s;h &s;ubject, than &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the legal <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The term legal is preferred here to lawful, becau&s;e it is le&s;s equivocal, and &s;o le&s;s liable to be perverted to a wrong &s;en&s;e, to countenance the arbitrary conduct of tho&s;e that are in pow|er. Lawful is often oppo&s;ed to &s;inful, or what God has forbidden: In which &s;en&s;e it is not true, that we are bound in con&s;cience to obey all the lawful commands of the civil magi&s;trate. If the command is not al&s;o legal, or &s;uch as the laws of the land authori&s;e him to give, it may be innocently di&s;regarded. Briti&s;h &s;ubjects are to obey the laws, not the capricious will of any magi&s;trate, whether &s;upreme or &s;ubor|dinate.</NOTE> com|mands of their political &s;uperiours.</P>
<P>BUT let me fini&s;h my reflections under this head, by cautioning all not to abu&s;e, or pervert the de&s;ign of their religious liberty, by affronting and contemning all religion, and living as without God in the world. A man that "throws firebrands, arrows and death", and thinks to vindicate &s;uch de&s;tructive &s;port, by &s;ay|ing that he is a free-born Briton, you will allow, has no proper idea of Briti&s;h liberty; but ought ra|ther to be accounted a madman than a civilian. But mad, at lea&s;t to the &s;ame degree, is every man who &s;ports with God and religion under the &s;ame pretence. I &s;ay, at lea&s;t, becau&s;e the laws forbid &s;uch impiety to God, as truly as they do, burning your neighbour's hou&s;e, or murder. So that the great freedom even of the Briti&s;h government, were that the only thing to be con&s;idered, is no good excu&s;e for irreligion
<PB N="50" REF="008192_0048_102E49FB0E7C9E40">
and impiety. But I have no great opinion of en|forcing religion by human laws, any further than to keep men from hurting and de&s;troying one another, (if that may be called religion) it being evident that &s;uch laws have, upon the whole, but very little, if any good effect. We will therefore &s;uppo&s;e for the pre|&s;ent, that there were no &s;uch laws in being. Does it from hence follow, that you are <Q>without law to God</Q>? or that you are not <Q>under the law to Chri&s;t,</Q> who came into this world to <Q>redeem us from all iniquity, and to purify unto him&s;elf a peculiar people, zealous of good works?</Q> You will not &s;ay, it does. Take heed then, that you do not abu&s;e your religious liberty; throw not all con|&s;cience a&s;ide, becau&s;e you have liberty of con&s;cience. For tho' you live under a free government; yea, which is much more, tho' "Chri&s;t has made us free" from every yoke of bondage, you ought to live in the faith and fear of God, and in obedience to his commands, under a &s;en&s;e of your being ac|countable to him; remembring the apo&s;tle's admo|nition,&mdash; <Q>as free, and not u&s;ing your liberty for a cloke of maliciou&s;ne&s;s, but as the &s;ervant of God.

<P N="2">2. LET us proceed to tho&s;e mercies which were referred to a &s;econd cla&s;s, in the foregoing di&s;cour&s;e; viz. the &s;ucce&s;&s;es given the la&s;t year to the arms of their Britannic and Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ties: On which we may make a few brief reflections. It appears from hence, that tho&s;e who are compelled to engage in a war for their own defence, having a good and ju&s;t cau&s;e, may rea&s;onably hope for &s;ucce&s;s, even tho' their enemies are far more numerous, and to human appearance much &s;tronger than they. The French are generally con&s;idered, and may perhaps be ju&s;tly looked on, as the mo&s;t potent nation of Europe. They compelled his Britannic Maje&s;ty, by their re|peated encroachments and ho&s;tilities, to engage in a war for the &s;ecurity of his American dominions. But tho', all circum&s;tances con&s;idered, they may be the &s;tronger, it is manife&s;t the battle, the &s;ucce&s;s, has not of late been to the &s;trong; nor indeed has it been &s;o on the whole, &s;ince the war began. God in his providence has apparently given &s;ucce&s;s to our righteous cau&s;e again&s;t &s;uperior numbers: For at lea&s;t as to numbers, there is no di&s;pute; nor would there be any room for doubt in other re&s;pects, were it not for the &s;uperiority of the royal navy of Britain. But the pre&s;ent remark is grounded chiefly on the &s;ucce&s;&s;es and victories of his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty: Who, tho' hemm'd round with many enemies mightier than him&s;elf, clo&s;ely united and leagued for his de&s;truction, has hitherto cut his way thro' them, has baffled their de&s;igns, and triumphed over them thro' God, who has
<PB N="52" REF="008192_0050_102E4A003009A738">
"taught his hands to war, and his fingers to fight." So great is the di&s;parity between him and his enemies, and &s;o extraordinary his victories and triumphs over them, that we &s;eem almo&s;t to be carried back to the age of Jo&s;hua, wherein <Q>one cha&s;ed a thou&s;and, and two put ten thou&s;and to flight.</Q> And if we &s;hould con&s;ider this hero of his age as fighting, in part, for the &s;upport of true religion, or chri&s;tian <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It mu&s;t be acknowledged that religion is, at mo&s;t, but a &s;econ|dary motive of the war in which his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty is en|gaged. However, his abhorrence of per&s;ecution, and &s;trong attachment to the principles of religious liberty in their utmo&s;t extent, appear in part from the following quotation. After &s;peaking of the religious &s;ects in his dominions, he concludes with the&s;e words, at once &s;o becoming a noble mind, a great prince, and a good chri&s;tian; "All the&s;e", &s;ays he, <Q>live here in peace, and contribute alike to the pro&s;perity of the &s;tate; for there is never a religion that differs greatly from the re&s;t, in re&s;pect of morality. Hence they may be all alike to the government, which of cour&s;e leaves every man at liberty to go to heaven which way he plea&s;es. All that is required of them is, to be peaceful and good &s;ubjects.

<P>WE are moreover taught from hence, both where to place our tru&s;t and dependence for a happy i&s;&s;ue of the pre&s;ent war, and where not to place it.

Perhaps it may &s;oon take as different a turn, as it did about the beginning of the pre&s;ent year; a turn, as calamitous to us, as that was favourable. This depends not on any man, or number of men, <Q>who&s;e breath is in their no&s;trils;</Q> and who have no wi&s;|dom, nor courage, nor power, independently of Him, who worketh all things according to the coun&s;el of his own will; who governs winds, and waters, and &s;ea&s;ons, and health, and di&s;ea&s;e, and all things, ac|cording to his plea&s;ure; before whom <Q>all the in|habitants of the earth are reputed as nothing.</Q> We cannot therefore be at any lo&s;s, in whom it be|comes us to place our hope and dependence, with re&s;pect to a continuance of our &s;ucce&s;&s;es. If God ari&s;e, his enemies &s;hall be &s;cattered: all they that hate him &s;hall flee before him; and the eagle of vic|tory, like the martial hawk, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Job XXXIX. 26.</NOTE> will "&s;tretch her wings" and fly, only by his wi&s;dom and command, whether

<P>TO fini&s;h our reflections on this heard: Since our whole, or, which comes to much the &s;ame thing, our ultimate dependence, is on almighty God, this admo|ni&s;hes us, by humble prayer and &s;upplication, to &s;eek his farther ble&s;&s;ing on the Briti&s;h coun&s;els and arms, and military operations; And, at the &s;ame time, &s;hews us the importance of reforming our ways, and work|ing righteou&s;ne&s;s.

Doubtle&s;s, if we are &s;o in reality, we &s;hall make con&s;cience of ob&s;erving the exacte&s;t rules of rea&s;on, &s;obriety and moderation, in the u&s;e of them from time to time; and whether we eat or drink, or whatever we do, do all to the glory of God, on whom "all eyes wait, that he may give them their meat in due &s;ea&s;on".</P>
<P>MOREOVER; from a con&s;ideration of the goodne&s;s of God to us, tho&s;e of us who have ability, &s;hould be excited to the exerci&s;e of charity and liberality to|wards

the poor and nece&s;&s;itous. For even in times of general plenty, there will be &s;ome &s;uch unhappy per&s;ons. "The poor", &s;ays our Saviour, <Q>you have always with you.</Q> Nor is there any better or more &s;ub&s;tantial way of outwardly manife&s;ting our gratitude and love toGod, than that of &s;hewing mercy to the proper objects of our charity. <Q>If any of you have this world's goods, &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, and &s;eeth his brother have need, and &s;hutteth up his bowels of compa&s;&s;ion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</Q> Wherefore, while we our|&s;elves ble&s;s God for the care he has taken of us, let <Q>the ble&s;&s;ing of him that is ready to peri&s;h come upon us</Q> for our alms, and &s;ea&s;onable relief. This will have a tendency to draw down further ble&s;&s;ings on our&s;elves. <Q>He hath di&s;per&s;ed abroad, he hath given to the poor; his righteou&s;ne&s;s re|maineth forever;</Q> and <Q>the liberal &s;oul &s;hall be made fat.</Q> We ought to account our&s;elves ho|noured by God in being made, as it were, his al|moners, to di&s;tribute his bounty to the needy. And, which will be a farther motive to the truly pious, this will cau&s;e, in many per&s;ons, thank&s;giving to God as, the &s;upreme author of the reliefs and &s;upplies which they receive from us, the in&s;truments of his mu|nificence.</P>
<P>TO conclude: While we ble&s;s God for our health, let us be admoni&s;hed to improve it aright, by making preparation in &s;ea&s;on for another world, in&s;tead of neglecting this preparation till a time of &s;ickne&s;s, in many re&s;pects un&s;uitable for &s;uch bu&s;ine&s;s, at lea&s;t to begin it. The body being di&s;order'd, generally di&s;orders and enfeebles the mind in &s;ome degree; and often quite incapacitates it for any rational acts, and mo&s;t of all for religion; which being altogether a
<PB N="56" REF="008192_0054_102E4A0ADAA5D6A0">
"rea&s;onable &s;ervice", peculiarly requires the exerci&s;e of the rational faculties. For I am &s;peaking of the chri&s;tian religion, not the religion of that antichri&s;tian church, wherein ignorance is both the mother and nur&s;e of devotion; and who&s;e u&s;urpations are chiefly &s;upported by the blindne&s;s and infatuation of the people.</P>
<P>BUT waving this con&s;ideration, you cannot be in|&s;en&s;ible that man, even in his be&s;t e&s;tate, <Q>is altoge|ther vanity;</Q> and that you may be &s;uddenly taken out of the world, without any previous warning, or time for preparation. There have lately been &s;eve|ral remarkable examples hereof in this town; and one, in a per&s;on <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Charles Apthorp <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> a merchant of the fir&s;t rank on the continent.</NOTE> of &s;uch di&s;tinction as has naturally attracted a general attention. How loud, how vocal, is &s;uch a di&s;pen&s;ation of providence? How plainly, even like the heavenly ray and words of in&s;piration, does it <Q>charge them that are rich, not to tru&s;t in uncertain riches?</Q> them that are &s;trong and heal|thy, not to tru&s;t in uncertain health; <Q>but in the living God, who giveth them all things richly to enjoy?</Q> It is like the voice which the prophet heard from heaven, crying, <Q>All fle&s;h is gra&s;s, and all the goodline&s;s thereof is as the flower of the field. The gra&s;s withereth, the flower fadeth,&mdash; &s;urely the people is gra&s;s.</Q> It may be ju&s;tly apprehended that many people have been taken out of the world as &s;uddenly, tho' far le&s;s prepared, than the per&s;on alluded to above; who was generally e&s;teemed an upright man, and a &s;incere friend to religion. However, it is God's prerogative to judge men. My view in reminding you of this in&s;tance of &s;udden death, is to &s;how you how very precarious

both your health and lives are; and hereby to excite you, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, &s;o to number your days, that you may, in &s;ea&s;on, apply your hearts unto wi&s;|dom; not to rely on your pre&s;ent health and &s;trength, but to improve them in working out your &s;alvation; that &s;o, how &s;oon or unexpectedly &s;oever <Q>the earthly hou&s;e of this your tabernacle may be di&s;&s;olved, you may have a building of God, an hou&s;e not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</Q> Ble&s;&s;ed, thrice ble&s;&s;ed are all the dead, who die in the Lord, whenever they die, and whatever circum&s;tances may attend their death: "Yea", &s;aith the &s;pirit, for they re&s;t <Q>from their labors, and their works do follow them.</Q> They &s;hall &s;urely have a part in the re|&s;urrection of the ju&s;t, thro' Him that hath <Q>aboli&s;hed death, and brought life and immortality to light thro' the go&s;pel;</Q> while others, however great or honourable in this world, &s;hall ari&s;e to &s;hame and "everla&s;ting contempt." And He that both died and ro&s;e again, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living, hath &s;aid, <Q>Behold, I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give to every man according as his work &s;hall be.</Q><Q>&mdash; Ble&s;&s;ed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in thro' the gate into the city. For without are dogs, and &s;orcerers, and whoremongers, and idolaters, and who&s;oever loveth and maketh a lie.</Q></P>
