What is de&s;ign'd to be re|pre&s;ented in the whole, is true in fact; and there are many in&s;tances and examples of it, in this and in the other worlds. The wicked are, &s;ome of them, rich, great, and pro&s;perous in this world; but extremely and everla&s;tingly mi&s;erable in the next. The godly are, &s;ome of them, poor, afflict|ed, de&s;pi&s;ed in this world, but infinitely and everla&s;tingly happy in the other. This is the &s;ub&s;tance, &s;cope, and end of this di&s;|cour&s;e of our Saviour.</P>
<P>The words of our text are &s;poken of the wicked rich man. He <HI>died,</HI> as well as the poor beggar; for riches cannot deliver from death. And was <HI>buried,</HI> which is not ob&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">v'd of the other; had a pompous and co&s;tly funeral, &s;utable to his worldly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tate and degree.

For (as &s;ays a judicious writer on the place,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr.<HI>T.

The eyes of his mind, which were &s;hut while he liv'd, were opened after death; his under&s;tanding and con&s;cience were now awakened, and he was convinc'd of tho&s;e things which he did not apprehend, or wou'd not believe before. <HI>Being in tor|ments:</HI> The pains of hell had now actu|ally got hold upon him; he felt &s;uch im|pre&s;&s;ions of the wrath of God upon his &s;oul, as were not to be match'd with the great|e&s;t bodily torments in this world.</P>
<P>The DOCTRINE I would now offer from the&s;e words is this, viz.</P>
<P><HI>It is a mo&s;t certain and awful truth, That there is a HELL, a place of mi&s;ery and torment, in which the wicked &s;hall be puni&s;h'd after this life.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="003526_0005_0FF856AAC2797BE0">
Under this Doctrine I propo&s;e only the&s;e two things.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. To give the <HI>proof</HI> and <HI>evi|dence</HI> that there is &s;uch a place and &s;tate of mi&s;ery, as we call <HI>hell,</HI> for the puni&s;hment of wicked and unholy per&s;ons after this life.</ITEM>

<P>This is indeed no plea&s;ing &s;ubject for us to in&s;i&s;t upon, but a nece&s;&s;ary one for you to hear of, which we, who are put in tru&s;t with the go&s;pel, mu&s;t not baulk. A part of the coun&s;el of God which we mu&s;t not &s;hun to declare to you, as we would be found faithful to your &s;ouls, and to our own, and to our ma&s;ter that &s;ends us. Our LORD JESUS CHRIST frequently preach'd up|on this &s;ubject in the days of his mini&s;try. How often and earne&s;tly did he tell his hearets of <HI>the damnation of hell</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxiii 33.</NOTE>, <HI>the fur|nace of fire</HI> into which the wicked &s;hall be ca&s;t<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mat. xiii. 42.</NOTE>, <HI>the place of darkne&s;s</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Mat. viii. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> <HI>where there is weeping and gna&s;hing of teeth;</HI> of <HI>the worm

And <HI>we</HI> &s;hou'd learn of <HI>Him</HI> how to preach, and fulfil our mini&s;try. Surely men need to hear of this now as much as then. Men have within them an evil heart of unbelief, that inclines them to que&s;tion this truth. Satan endeavours to per&s;wade them out of the belief of it, as he did our fir&s;t parents. He &s;aid to the woman, Tho' ye do eat, <HI>ye &s;hall not &s;urely die,</HI> Gen. iii. 4. So he &s;ays to &s;inners now, Tho' you do tran&s;gre&s;s you &s;hall not be damn'd; ye &s;hall not &s;urely go to hell. He promi&s;es them impunity, and &s;o makes them the &s;ervants of &s;in. Men had need therefore be con|firm'd in the belief of this truth now, le&s;t their infidelity be cur'd by woful experience. Hell torments are not a melancholy fancy, no cunningly devi&s;ed fable, nor empty threatning; but an awful truth, a dread|ful reality. For</P>
<P N="1">1. This is a doctrine that does but agree with the <HI>maje&s;ty</HI> and <HI>authority</HI> of the great God as the <HI>king</HI> and <HI>judge</HI> of the world.
<PB N="6" REF="003526_0007_0FF856AC95F4BA40">The Lord is a great God, and a great king above all gods. He is the king eternal, im|mortal, invi&s;ible; the ble&s;&s;ed and the only potentate: The king of kings, and lord of lords; with whom is terrible maje&s;ty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. vi. 15.

How wou'd his government be expos'd and weakn'd if it &s;hou'd be otherwi&s;e? This wou'd encou|rage mutiny in heaven, and rebellion on earth. To what purpo&s;e would it be for him to call &s;inning angels and men to an account, if he had no where to puni&s;h them for their offences? Thus, 'tis but &s;utable to the divine maje&s;ty and authority that there &s;hou'd be a hell for the puni&s;hment of the wicked.</P>

2.

This is not vi&s;ibly done in the pre&s;ent world. Now wickedne&s;s &s;eems to be conniv'd at, and &s;inners to be countenanc'd, rather than otherwi&s;e, by being indulg'd with outward ea&s;e, pomp, and pro&s;perity, as was the rich man the text &s;peaks of. This was an anci|ent difficulty, which the people of God ob|&s;erv'd, and were ready to &s;tumble at. Jer. xii. 1. <HI>Righteous art thou, O Lord! Yet let me talk of thy judgments: Wherefore doth the way of the wicked pro&s;per?</HI> Job xxi. 7&mdash;13. <HI>Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?

<P N="3">3. CHRIST'S <HI>coming into the world, his &s;uf|ferings and death,</HI> are a convincing argu|ment and proof that there is a hell. Why did He come into the world, but to &s;ave his people from this place of mi&s;ery? "He did not come to &s;ave them from the le&s;&s;er con&s;equences of &s;in, &s;uch as the calamities of this pre&s;ent life, and bodily death; for to the&s;e they are &s;till expos'd, tho' he is made redemption to them. It can't rea|&s;onably be tho't a de&s;ign great eno' for the &s;on of God to come from heaven to earth upon, and to lay down his life for, to &s;ave us only from bodily and temporal evils. Surely our Lord had not come from the <HI>highe&s;t heavens,</HI> but to &s;ave us from the <HI>low|e&s;t hell.</HI> The &s;alvation of Chri&s;t is call'd <HI>a deliverance from the wrath to come,</HI> 1 The&s;. 1.10.

Moreover, They were the very <HI>pains of hell</HI> which our Lord &s;uffered.

No, the&s;e things were ab&s;olutely incon&s;i&s;tent with the holine&s;s, purity, and dignity of his per&s;on. The &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t and the &s;ufferings of the damned, were therefore nece&s;&s;arily different in &s;everal circum&s;tances of them. Neverthele&s;s our Lord did &s;uffer in his &s;oul &s;uch <HI>pains, horror, agony,</HI> and <HI>terror,</HI> as were of the &s;ame nature and kind with the &s;ufferings of hell<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">After this manner very judicious Divines, the grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Calvin</HI> and others, &s;peak of the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE>; &s;uch as none ever &s;uffer'd on this &s;ide hell, and carried in them the e&s;&s;ence of the puni&s;hment of the &s;econd death. For the wrath of God due to the elect for their &s;ins, was poured into his &s;oul, and he bore the cur&s;e of the law in the full weight of it. <HI>Gal.</HI> iii. 13. How inconceivably great were his &s;ufferings in the garden? In his <HI>agony</HI> there <HI>he was afraid, and amazed, and fell flat on the ground:</HI> He
<PB N="11" REF="003526_0012_0FF856E7393F1B08">began to be <HI>&s;ore amazed,</HI> and to be <HI>very heavy;</HI> and &s;aid to tho&s;e that were with him, <HI>My &s;oul is exceeding &s;orrowful, even unto death: And his &s;weat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxvi. 37, 38.

The &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t were an&s;werable to the pains of hell, and therefore call'd &s;uch in &s;cripture. For to Chri&s;t the &s;on of <HI>David,</HI> of whom <HI>David</HI> was a type, we may apply tho&s;e words of the P&s;almi&s;t, P&s;alm xviii. 5. <HI>The &s;orrows of hell compa&s;&s;ed me about.</HI> P&s;alm cxvi. 3. <HI>The &s;orrows of death compa&s;&s;ed me about, the pains of hell gat hold upon me.</HI> Chri&s;t did not feel the &s;orrows of hell <HI>after</HI> death, but he felt them in his &s;oul while he liv'd, before his death; the very &s;ame (as has been &s;aid) for kind and &s;ub&s;tance, tho' not after the &s;ame manner, and in the &s;ame circum&s;tances.</P>

Here now is another <HI>proof</HI> or <HI>demon|&s;tration</HI> of this truth, That there is a hell for the wicked. If Chri&s;t did feel and &s;uffer the very pains of hell, when he bore the wrath and cur&s;e of God due to the elect for their &s;ins, then certainly there is a hell, a place provided and prepared, in which the wicked &s;hall &s;uffer his wrath and vengeance for ever. As our Lord was going to &s;uffer and die, he turned him&s;elf to the company which followed him, and &s;aid, <HI>If they do the&s;e things in a green Tree, what &s;hall be done in the dry?</HI> Luke xxiii. 31. As much as if he had &s;aid, "If God deliver me up to &s;uch &s;uf|ferings as the&s;e, becau&s;e I am made a &s;a|crifice for &s;in, what will he do with &s;inners them&s;elves"? Truly from the bitter &s;uf|ferings of Chri&s;t, we may ju&s;tly infer what <HI>&s;hou'd</HI> have been done to the whole race of mankind, if he had not interpos'd; and what <HI>&s;hall</HI> be done to tho&s;e who die in their &s;ins, un&s;anctified and unpardoned. If God did this to the &s;on of his love, when he found &s;in but imputed to him, what &s;hall he do to the children of his wrath, whom he will find under the guilt and reigning power of &s;in? The apo&s;tle argues after this manner in another ca&s;e, 1 Pet. iv. 17. <HI>If judgment begin at the hou&s;e

<P N="2">II. We come now to &s;peak a little of the awful <HI>&s;ea&s;ons</HI> or <HI>periods</HI> at which &s;in|ners pa&s;s into this place of puni&s;hment. The&s;e are <HI>two:</HI> At death, and after the general judgment.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>&s;ouls</HI> of the wicked go into the place of puni&s;hment at <HI>death.</HI> The &s;crip|ture gives us to apprehend a particular judgment to which the &s;ouls of all men go immediately after death. Heb. ix. 27. <HI>It is appointed for all men once to die, and after this the judgment;</HI> the latter follows upon or immediately after the former. When the <HI>du&s;t returns to the du&s;t as it was, the &s;pirit goes to God who gave it,</HI> Eccl. xii. 7. It goes to him as a judge, to be by him determin'd to its eternal &s;tate. And this way looks that of the Apo&s;tle, Rom. xiv. 12. <HI>So then every one of us will give account of him&s;elf to God;</HI> every one &s;ingly and alone will do &s;o, at the end of this life. Then a judgment pa&s;&s;es upon every &s;oul, previous to that which will be at the end of the world, tho' there is the &s;ame event as to both: For the particular judgment <Q>at the end of this life, determines the &s;oul to that happine&s;s or mi&s;ery, which
<PB N="22" REF="003526_0023_0FF856C0288C0528">the general judgment at the end of the world will determine &s;oul and body to.</Q> There is therefore a <HI>fir&s;t damnation,</HI> ante|cedent to the re&s;urrection, and that treads upon the heels of death, which re&s;pects the &s;oul only. This is repre&s;ented to us in vi&s;ion, Rev. vi. 8. <HI>And I looked, and behold a pale hor&s;e; and his name that &s;at on him was death, and hell followed with him.</HI> The &s;ouls of &s;uch as die in their &s;ins are adjudg'd to hell by God, and car|ried there by devils, as &s;oon as they leave their bodies; and while their bodies lie in the grave, their &s;ouls are in torment there. This is plain from our text, and the <HI>whole narrative</HI> which it is a part of. The wicked rich man, was no &s;ooner dead, but <HI>in hell he lift up his eyes being in torments: and cried out, I am tormented in this flame.</HI></P>
<P>The reward of the <HI>righteous</HI> begins at the hour of death: &s;o does the puni&s;h|ment of the wicked. It would be a favour indeed if &s;inners might have their puni&s;h|ment &s;u&s;pended till the re&s;urrection, du|ring the long interval between their death and the judgment day: but it will not be &s;o. When the &s;ouls of the wicked go to God at death, he <HI>delivers them to the tor|mentors,</HI> Mat. xviii. 34. And therefore we have the P&s;almi&s;t praying and depre|cating,
<PB N="23" REF="003526_0024_0FF856F48A7AF008">as in P&s;alm xxvi. 9. <HI>Gather not my &s;oul with &s;inners.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. After the <HI>re&s;urrection</HI> they will be ca&s;t into it in their whole per&s;ons, <HI>body and &s;oul</HI> united as they are now. When the trial of the great day is over, that &s;en|tence will be pronounced upon the wicked, Mat. xxv. 41. <HI>Depart ye cur&s;ed into ever|la&s;ting fire, prepared for the devil and his an|gels.</HI> This &s;entence will be executed as &s;oon as pa&s;s'd. The holy angels, tho&s;e mini&s;ters of his that do his plea&s;ure, being arm'd with power &s;ufficient, &s;hall be the executioners of it. Mat. xiii. 41, 42. &mdash;<HI>So &s;hall it be in the end of the world. The &s;on of man &s;hall &s;end forth his angels, and they &s;hall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniqui|ty; and &s;hall ca&s;t them into a furnace of fire: there &s;hall be wailing and gna&s;hing of teeth.</HI> We are told what the i&s;&s;ue of the la&s;t judgment wil be, in Rev. xx. 14. <HI>And death and hell</HI> (the wicked who&s;e bo|dies were rais'd out of the grave, and who&s;e &s;pirits were fetch'd from the infernal re|gion) <HI>were ca&s;t</HI> (body and &s;oul together) <HI>into the lake of fire which is the &s;econd death.</HI> So we read, Job xxi. 30. <HI>The wicked is re&s;erved to the day of de&s;truction; they &s;hall be brought forth to the day of wrath:</HI> As
<PB N="24" REF="003526_0025_0FF856C256C58F30">malefactors are brought forth out of pri|&s;on in order to their execution. Agreably our Saviour has forewarn'd us, Mat. x. 28. <HI>Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the &s;oul; but rather fear him which is able to de&s;troy both &s;oul and body in hell.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this account damned &s;pirits do now dread the judgment day, and think of it with horror. The devils do &s;o; for then their mi&s;ery and torment will be greater than now it is. <HI>Mat.</HI> viii. 29. And, doubtle&s;s, 'tis the &s;ame with damned &s;ouls: For tho' their mi&s;ery is now inexpre&s;&s;ibly great, yet not &s;o great as it will be after the judgment day, when body and &s;oul together &s;hall be ca&s;t into hell, and they will &s;uffer in their whole man. Hence the <HI>unju&s;t</HI> are &s;aid to be <HI>re&s;erved unto the day of judgment to be puni&s;hed;</HI> becau&s;e that will be the day of their compleat puni&s;h|ment. 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> ii. 9.</P>
<P>If now it &s;hould be ask'd by any, Where is the hell you have been di&s;cour&s;ing of? And is the place of mi&s;ery the &s;ame now that it will be after the day of judgment? I an&s;wer, This is what the &s;cripture hath not clearly reveal'd; and it becomes us to beware of vain curio&s;ities; of <HI>intruding into tho&s;e things which we have not &s;een,</HI> as
<PB N="25" REF="003526_0026_0FF856F764646800">the Apo&s;tle's phra&s;e is, Col. ii. 18. It concerns us but little to know now, whe|ther hell be in the air, or in the concave of the earth.

<P>Let therefore the pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e come to us upon the &s;ame errand, the rich man de&s;ir'd <HI>Lazarus</HI> might be &s;ent upon to his brethren in his father's hou&s;e, namely, <HI>to te&s;tify unto</HI> us <HI>le&s;t we come into this place of torment.</HI> O let all of us be convinc'd of that now, which none of us will be able to doubt of hereafter.

<P>There are various kinds of evils and mi|&s;eries, which men &s;uffer in this world, from the righteous hand and providence of God, as the fruit and puni&s;hment of &s;in.

But the torments in hell do far exceed any of the&s;e, or whatever other can be invented by the wit or malice of men.

<P>Gracious &s;upports the damned in hell have none. God does not &s;upport them in their mi&s;ery, as he does his children in this world, under the fatherly afflictions he lays upon them for their good; where|by they are kept from fainting in the day of adver&s;ity, and are enabled to bear his hand with meekne&s;s, patience and re&s;ig|nation; with a filial &s;ubjection to him the father of &s;pirits.

<P N="1">1. <HI>It is but rea&s;onable the puni&s;hment of offenders &s;hou'd be proportion'd, as to the de|gree of it, to the nature of their offenies.</HI></P>
<P>This is an allow'd rule of equity among men. To apply this now to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e. There is an infinite guilt in &s;in. An offence ri&s;es in proportion to the dignity of the per&s;on offended again&s;t. Now the maje&s;ty of God is truly infinite, again&s;t whom &s;in is committed; and con&s;equent|ly the guilt of &s;in exceeds our tho'ts, is immen&s;e and infinite. O! what an intoler|able thing is it, that proud du&s;t &s;hould fly in the face of his glorious maker, and de|ny his authority over him? What an in|&s;ufferable provocation, that the rea&s;ona|ble creature, who is naturally and nece&s;|&s;arily a &s;ubject, &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e the divine law and lawgiver! &s;hould boldly and in|&s;olently &s;ay, <HI>Who is the Lord, that I &s;hould obey his voice?</HI> and hardily dare him to do his wor&s;t!

<P N="2">2. The torments of hell are of <HI>God's own preparing for his enemies that rebel a|gain&s;t him;</HI> and therefore mu&s;t be &s;uppos'd to be exceeding great.</P>
<P>It may well be expected the extremity of the puni&s;hment will be in proportion to the preparation that has been made for it. Now <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">phet was ordain'd of old,</HI> I&s;ai. xxx. 33.

Prepared for them by God in the greatne&s;s of his wi&s;dom and power. Hell's torments as well as heaven's glories, are the product of divine eternal coun&s;els. As there is great prepa|ration made for the entertainment of the &s;aints in the kingdom of glory, &s;o is there al&s;o great preparation made for the puni&s;h|ment
<PB N="40" REF="003526_0041_0FF856D35E53A430">of the wicked in the place of mi&s;ery. And &s;urely the puni&s;hment mu&s;t be ex|ceeding great which is thus prepared. The <HI>preparation</HI> &s;hews the <HI>extremity.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3 The puni&s;hments of hell are al&s;o <HI>in|flicted by God in the greatne&s;s of his power and wrath;</HI> therefore they are extreme and intolerable.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e none el&s;e can inflict puni&s;h|ments heavy eno', He will then deal with &s;inners Him&s;elf, take them into His own hands. And what <HI>a fearful thing</HI> mu&s;t it be <HI>to fall into the hands of the living God?</HI> Temporal evils are inflicted by the media|tion of &s;econd cau&s;es, that are of a limited power to hurt: but in the next world God more immediately torments the damned by his own power. And <HI>who knows the power of his anger? Even according to his fear, &s;o is his wrath,</HI> P&s;al. xc. II. <HI>God will &s;hew his WRATH, and make his POWER known in the ve&s;&s;els of wrath,</HI> Rom. ix 22. In them, and upon them, God will &s;hew to all the world, his puni&s;hing ju&s;tice, his enmity to &s;in, and the &s;trength of his in|flicting power. How great then mu&s;t their &s;ufferings be, which are de&s;ign'd as a de|mon&s;tration of the&s;e things? Once more,</P>

The &s;cripture makes a direct oppo&s;ition between the&s;e.

<P>But <HI>the &s;oul</HI> being the chief &s;inner in this world, &s;hall be the chief &s;ufferer in the o|ther. <HI>That</HI> &s;hall &s;uffer beyond what the body is capable of, from the immediate impre&s;&s;ions of divine vindictive wrath. The e&s;&s;ence of the puni&s;hment of hell lies in this, THE WRATH OF THE ETERNAL GOD, FILLING AN IMMORTAL SOUL, WHOSE FA|CULTIES ARE VASTLY INLARGED TO RECEIVE THE IMPRESSIONS OF THAT WRATH. What the mo&s;t enraged fire is to the body, that, and more than that, is <HI>this</HI> to the &s;oul. And as the body will be tormented in all its members, &s;o will the &s;oul in all its faculties.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="003526_0048_0FF8570F97DC3EF0">
The <HI>mind</HI> will have pre&s;ented to it dreadful vi&s;ions of horror. It will then have the mo&s;t di&s;mal apprehen&s;ions of the evil of &s;in, the holine&s;s, ju&s;tice, power, maje&s;ty and eternity of God. Then the vail of judicial blindne&s;s will be taken a|way, and the &s;pirit of deep &s;leep which is now upon &s;inners will go off, and they will be powerfully convinc'd of tho&s;e things, which here they did not appre|hend, or would not reali&s;e.

<P>The <HI>will</HI> remains, and &s;trongly wi&s;hes for good, but finds none; can meet with nothing but what is evil, what it is aver&s;e from and contrary to.</P>
<P>The <HI>con&s;cience</HI> will always be accu&s;ing and condemning, la&s;hing and &s;courging, for &s;ins committed, and duties neglected; for the many calls of God which have been refus'd, and the &s;trivings of the Spi|rit which have been re&s;i&s;ted.</P>

<P>Nor may any one think this is light and ea&s;y to be born; for great is the power of the mind to torture and torment.

For they are all extremely mi&s;erable and ex|tremely wicked both. They will &s;uffer from the rage and madne&s;s of one another. And they will hear from each other no|thing but di&s;quieting groans, piercing &s;hrieks, and horrid bla&s;phemies. <HI>David</HI> laments him&s;elf, P&s;a. cxx. 5. <HI>Wo is me that I &s;ojourn in Me&s;ech, and dwell in the tents of Kedar;</HI> a|mong a people rude and barbarous, hat|ful and hating.

<P>_NEXT to there being no hell at all, the mo&s;t acceptable doctrine to a &s;inner wou'd be, that the puni&s;hment of hell is temporary, and &s;hould &s;ometime or other come to an end. This is what &s;atan, that old deceiver, wou'd induce men to believe if he cou'd; and this is what the &s;inner wou'd fain flat|ter him&s;elf with the hopes of. If there|fore they can't ra&s;e &s;uch words as
<PB N="58" REF="003526_0059_0FF8571DAA0BE2B0"><HI>everla&s;ting, for ever and ever,</HI> out of their bibles, they'l try what &s;oftning interpreta|tion can be put upon them; whether by &s;ome weak critici&s;m of language, or trifling cavils of carnal rea&s;on, they can't overthrow a doctrine which gives them &s;o much di&s;tur|bance in their &s;ins, and puts &s;uch a block in the way of their unlawful pur&s;uits.</P>
<P>The <HI>Eternity</HI> of the puni&s;hment of hell is what above any thing makes it &s;o dread|ful. If men did once imagine it to be any thing &s;hort of an endle&s;s duration, their fear of it, and care to avoid it wou'd pro|portionably abate; the threatnings of God wou'd loo&s;e their force and terror; and when men <HI>heard the words of the cur&s;e, they would ble&s;s them&s;elves in their hearts, &s;aying, We &s;hall have peace, tho' we walk the imagi|nation of our hearts</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">xxix. 19.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>From the 6. ver. of this chapter, we are told of three angels, or me&s;&s;engers, &s;ent from heaven, to give notice of the fall of <HI>Baby|lon,</HI> and of tho&s;e things that were antece|dent and con&s;equent to that great event.</P>
<P>The <HI>fir&s;t angel</HI> was &s;ent on an errand previous to it; and that was to <HI>preach</HI> the go&s;pel, <HI>the everla&s;ting go&s;pel to them that dwell on the earth:</HI> that &s;o men might be bro't <HI>to fear God,</HI> and <HI>give glory to him;</HI> becau&s;e <HI>the hour of his judgment was come,</HI> ver&s;e 6, 7.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;econd angel</HI> follows the other, and proclaims the actual fall of <HI>Babylon,</HI> &s;ay|ing, <HI>Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city; becau&s;e &s;he hath made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>third angel</HI> follows the other two, and gives warning to all of that divine venge|ance, that tremendous puni&s;hment, which wou'd overtake all that ob&s;tinately adher'd to the antichri&s;tian intere&s;t, and per&s;i&s;ted in their damning idolatries.

<P>The point of DOCTRINE to be &s;poken to from the words is this, <HI>The torments of the damned in hell will be ETERNAL, and never never have an end.</HI></P>

Eternity is an amazing thing! O the va&s;tne&s;s of an endle&s;s duration! Who can mea&s;ure the length of it? While we &s;trive to reach it, it is &s;till further off from us! When we have &s;et off as many thou&s;ands and millions of years, as numbers can reckon up, we are no nearer to an end, than before we began!

In a word, They will always have an eternity of torments to expect and endure.</P>
<P>This now is the <HI>very hell of hell;</HI> that which is mo&s;t terrible in it.

<P N="1">1. We find the words <HI>eternal, everla&s;t|ing, for ever, for ever and ever,</HI> join'd with the torments of hell, the mi&s;ery of the damned, thro'out the book of God. I&s;ai. xxxiii. 14. <HI>The &s;inners in Zion are afraid,

<P>It is true, the words <HI>everla&s;ting,</HI> and <HI>for ever,</HI> are &s;ometimes u&s;ed in &s;cripture, as well as in common &s;peech, for a duration
<PB N="64" REF="003526_0065_0FF85723AC2F7E30">that will have an end. But when they are &s;o u&s;ed, the &s;en&s;e is obvious, and the nature of the thing &s;poken of, &s;ufficiently &s;hews the meaning in which they are to be taken; and, which is of great weight, they commonly &s;ignifie too that the thing &s;poken of &s;hall endure, as long as the &s;ub|ject of it does endure. Thus for in&s;tance, when the <HI>hills</HI> are called <HI>everla&s;ting hills,</HI> (Gen. xlix. 26.) every one readily appre|hends they are &s;o called, becau&s;e while o|ther things peri&s;h out of the world in a number of years, the&s;e will remain till this lower world it &s;elf, which they are &s;o con&s;picuous a part of, will be di&s;&s;olved. Thus al&s;o the prie&s;thood entail'd upon <HI>Phi|neas</HI>'s family, for his pious zeal in the matter of <HI>Zimri</HI> and <HI>Cosbi,</HI> is called (<HI>Numb.</HI> xxv. 13.) an <HI>everla&s;ting prie&s;thood,</HI> becau&s;e it &s;hou'd continue to the period of the old te&s;ta|ment di&s;pen&s;ation. So, when 'tis &s;aid <HI>the lepro&s;y of Naaman &s;hould cleave to him, and his po&s;terity for ever.</HI> (2 Kings v. 27.) the meaning is plainly this, That &s;o long as any of his po&s;terity remain'd, that evil di&s;|ea&s;e &s;hould cleave to them. After the &s;ame manner, when 'tis &s;aid, Eccle&s;. i. 4. <HI>One generation pa&s;&s;eth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever;</HI> the &s;en&s;e is mo&s;t obviou&s;ly this,
<PB N="65" REF="003526_0066_0FF8575C999F6708">That the earth is to remain, till the &s;eve|ral generations of men de&s;ign'd by God to be born, are compleated. In &s;uch a way as this, the words <HI>everla&s;ting,</HI> and <HI>for ever,</HI> are &s;ometimes us'd for a duration that will have an end. But they can't be &s;o under&s;tood when applied to, and join'd with future puni&s;hments: And this for the following weighty rea&s;ons.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The <HI>&s;ame words</HI> are us'd to expre&s;s the <HI>everla&s;ting mi&s;ery of the wicked,</HI> as are us'd to expre&s;s the <HI>everla&s;ting happine&s;s of the godly</HI> in the other world.

If therefore the happine&s;s of the godly in the other world mu&s;t be under&s;tood to be eternal, and their ble&s;&s;edne&s;s to be &s;uch as &s;hall have no end, (which none deny) we mu&s;t under|&s;tand
<PB N="66" REF="003526_0067_0FF85725E71B0068">the &s;ame of the mi&s;ery and puni&s;h|ment of the wicked. Both are &s;poken of exactly in the &s;ame manner, without any the lea&s;t intimation of a difference in the duration of them. And which makes the matter clearer,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The happine&s;s of the godly, and the mi&s;ery of the wicked, are &s;et in <HI>direct oppo&s;ition</HI> one to another. <HI>The&s;e &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment, but the righteous into life eternal.</HI> The direct op|po&s;ition, between everla&s;ting puni&s;hment and everla&s;ting life, in the&s;e words of our Saviour, is a convincing argument they are to be under&s;tood in the &s;ame extent, for an ab&s;olute eternity.
<P>And which is &s;till more,</P></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The <HI>eternity of hell torments,</HI> is ex|pre&s;s'd in the &s;ame words that are us'd to expre&s;s the <HI>eternity of God him&s;elf.</HI> Thus when we read of <HI>the everla&s;ting God</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE>, in Rom. xvi. 26, the &s;ame word is us'd as when we read of everla&s;ting fire, ever|la&s;ting puni&s;hment, and everla&s;ting de|&s;truction, in the places that have been mention'd. And thus the phra&s;e in our text us'd to expre&s;s the eternity of hell torments, viz. <HI>for ever and ever,</HI> is us'd
<PB N="67" REF="003526_0068_0FF8575E230149D8">to expre&s;s God's own eternity. Rev. v. 14. <HI>Him that liveth for ever and ever:</HI> and in other places. So that if God's own eter|nity can be prov'd from &s;cripture, the e|ternity of hell torments is to be prov'd from it al&s;o. The eternity of both is &s;po|ken of ju&s;t in the &s;ame manner; and there is as much &s;cripture proof of this as there is of the other. And indeed the words <HI>for ever and ever,</HI> us'd in our text, and in other places re&s;pecting the tor|ments of hell, are us'd no where in the <HI>new te&s;tament,</HI> where they are to be under|&s;tood of any thing le&s;s than an endle&s;s duration. I find them us'd eighteen or twenty times, and always importing an endle&s;s duration.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Every thing that relates to the torment of the damned,</HI> is in &s;cripture &s;aid to be <HI>eternal.</HI> Thus <HI>God,</HI> the author of their puni&s;hment, is the <HI>eternal God,</HI> the <HI>everla&s;t|ing Jehovah,</HI> who ever lives to puni&s;h.

<PB N="68" REF="003526_0069_0FF85728174CEB88">for their greater certainty, and more heedful ob&s;ervation. Mark ix. 44, 46, 48. <HI>WHERE THEIR WORM DI|ETH NOT, AND THE FIRE IS NOT QUENCHED. &mdash; WHERE THEIR WORM DIETH NOT, AND THE FIRE IS NOT QUENCHED. &mdash; WHERE THEIR WORM DIETH NOT, AND THE FIRE IS NOT QUENCHED.</HI> The <HI>chains</HI> that hold them in their torment are call'd <HI>everla&s;ting chains,</HI> Jud. 6. ver. And, which is very con&s;iderable in the pre&s;ent argument, the <HI>judgment</HI> by which they are condemn'd to it, is call'd <HI>eternal judgment,</HI> Heb. vi. 2. Now, it cannot be call'd eter|nal judgment in re&s;pect of the continu|ance of admini&s;tration, but only with a regard to the effect and i&s;&s;ue of it.

Thus, not only is the puni&s;hment of the damned &s;aid to be eternal, but <HI>every thing that re|lates and conduces to it,</HI> is &s;aid to be &s;o al&s;o.</P>
<P N="3">3. Agreable to all this, the &s;cripture re|pre&s;ents the condition of &s;inners in the o|ther world to be <HI>hopele&s;s</HI> and <HI>de&s;perate.</HI>
<PB N="69" REF="003526_0070_0FF857600977EB70">Thus we are told, <HI>When a wicked man dieth, his expectation &s;hall peri&s;h,</HI> Prov. xi. 7.

<P>And hence 'tis that hell is call'd the place of <HI>outer</HI> and <HI>utter darkne&s;s,</HI> becau&s;e the condition of tho&s;e that are in it, is for ever hopele&s;s and remedile&s;s; and they are without the mo&s;t di&s;tant re&s;erves of mercy.

<P><PB N="34" REF="003526_0071_0FF8572A50EB4C80">
Thus we &s;ee, how plainly and &s;trongly the doctrine of the eternity of hell tor|ments, is taught us in the word of God. The &s;cripture &s;peaks of the eternity of the puni&s;hment of the wicked in the other world, in words that import an endle&s;s duration, in the &s;ame manner that it &s;peaks of the eternity of the happine&s;s of heaven, yea of the eternity of God him|&s;elf. It &s;peaks of every thing that re|lates to their puni&s;hment as being eternal. And agreable to this, it every where re|pre&s;ents the condition of &s;inners in the other world, as hopele&s;s and de&s;perate. After this manner is this doctrine taught us in the holy &s;criptures; &s;o plainly and fully, that words can't be found out to expre&s;s it in a fuller or clearer manner.</P>
<P N="2">II. The &s;econd thing propos'd was, to &s;hew, <HI>why</HI> or <HI>whence it is,</HI> that the puni&s;h|ment of the damned is to be, and mu&s;t be, nothing le&s;s than eternal. The re&s;ol|ving this into the rea&s;ons of it, will not only help to clear the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in it, but be &s;o many arguments fur|ther to evince the truth and certainty hereof.</P>
<P>This indeed might be re&s;olved into the <HI>will</HI> and <HI>determination</HI> of God; and there
<PB N="71" REF="003526_0072_0FF85763885AC758">is good rea&s;on why his creatures need look no further: For we are &s;ure, whatever God wills and determines can't be unrea|&s;onable, unju&s;t or unholy, but mu&s;t per|fectly agree with the excellencies and per|fections of his nature, however it may appear to our depraved rea&s;on. Yet we have &s;everal things to offer as rea&s;ons of the doctrine, and for the &s;hewing how fit|ting, agreable, and ju&s;t it is, for God to puni&s;h &s;in and &s;inners everla&s;tingly.</P>
<P N="1">1. A le&s;s puni&s;hment wou'd not be a <HI>&s;u|table &s;anction to the divine law.</HI></P>
<P>Where a law is not guarded and en|forc'd by &s;utable &s;anctions, the wi&s;dom o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> power of the lawgiver may be call'd in que&s;tion. The &s;anctions mu&s;t be &s;uted to the nature and capacity of the &s;ubject for whom the law is de&s;ign'd. Now, as man is an immortal creature, a creature made and de&s;ign'd by God for an endle&s;s life, 'tis certainly mo&s;t fit and &s;utable for him, to be ruled by a law that promi&s;es an immo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tal reward, and threatens an endle&s;s puni&s;h|ment. Otherwi&s;e the law wou'd not be fram'd agreable to the nature of the &s;ub|ject, who will not be fully rul'd by any lower means, than the hopes and fears of everla&s;ting things.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="003526_0073_0FF8572D333E8BA8">
Indeed, we find by &s;ad ob&s;ervation and experience, that the&s;e are not always &s;uffi|cient to keep men within the compa&s;s of their duty, and to re&s;train them from &s;in. For the &s;ake of &s;ome momentany plea&s;ure or profit, or for the fear of &s;ome pre&s;ent temporal detriment and inconvenience, men will every day break God's law, and thereby hazard the lo&s;s of eternal good, and incur the enduring everla&s;ting evils. This makes it plain that &s;uch a &s;anction is no more than is needed. If it was any thing lower, and the puni&s;hment threat|ned was but temporary and limited, how much more bold wou'd &s;inners be in tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ing the divine law? And might they not then with &s;ome rea&s;on too, lay the fault upon the lawgiver, for being &s;o de|fective as not to enforce his law with a &s;utable penalty?</P>
<P N="2">2. A le&s;s puni&s;hment wou'd not be <HI>pro|portionable to the guilt of &s;in.</HI></P>
<P>There is an infinite guilt in &s;in: it of|fends again&s;t an infinite maje&s;ty; it vio|lates tho&s;e infinite obligations we are un|der to &s;ubjection and obedience to him, and reflects an infinite di&s;honour to his laws and government: Therefore an in|finite puni&s;hment does but come up to the
<PB N="73" REF="003526_0074_0FF85765E4C813A0">demerit of it. A puni&s;hment infinite in <HI>duration,</HI> becau&s;e an infinite weight of wrath at once, cannot be born by a finite creature.</P>
<P>And if any think a <HI>temporary puni&s;hment</HI> may &s;uffice for it, this is becau&s;e they have light tho'ts of &s;in, and don't &s;ee how exceeding &s;inful it is. If nothing but the blood of the &s;on of God, which was the <HI>blood of God,</HI> ina&s;much as He was God and man in one per&s;on; and which was a &s;atisfaction <HI>infinite in value,</HI> the dignity of his per&s;on giving &s;uch a merit to his &s;ufferings: If, I &s;ay, nothing le&s;s than His blood, cou'd procure a pardon for be|lieving repenting &s;inners; what le&s;s puni&s;hment than eternal, can rea&s;onably be &s;uppos'd, to be inflicted upon &s;inners that are finally impenitent and unbeliev|ing, and &s;o cut them&s;elves off from the benefit of his &s;atisfaction?</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>truth</HI> of God is now concern'd to make the puni&s;hment of the damned eternal.</P>
<P>For what we read in &s;cripture of eter|nal puni&s;hments, are not <HI>threatnings only,</HI> (and if they were, it is certainly mo&s;t a|greable to the divine perfections they

<P>That none may per&s;wade and flatter them&s;elves, that the judge will in the great day be more favourable than the threatning of the law, He who is to be the judge has told us, that the wicked &s;hall not only be &s;entenced to everla&s;ting fire, but that the &s;entence &s;hall be execu|ted. Mat. xxv. 46. <HI>THESE SHALL GO AWAY INTO EVERLASTING PU|NISHMENT.</HI> This is no other than a &s;trong and po&s;itive affirmation: an ex|pre&s;s declaration of God's invariable de|cree, will, and purpo&s;e.

<P N="4">4. The puni&s;hment of the damned in hell mu&s;t be eternal, that &s;o <HI>the ju&s;tice of God may have its everla&s;ting di&s;play.</HI></P>
<P>Every divine attribute is to &s;hine forth with an eternal lu&s;tre; for they are all dear and glorious to him, one as well as another. His <HI>wi&s;dom, power,</HI> and <HI>goodne&s;s,</HI> will be eternally manife&s;ted in the things which he has made in the upper world. His <HI>grace</HI> and <HI>mercy</HI> will for ever be ad|mir'd and magnified in the &s;alvation of a remnant of lo&s;t &s;inners, who will then be made ve&s;&s;els of glory.

The glory of this

<P N="5">5. <HI>The damned in hell are, and for ever will be, utterly unqualified for the divine fa|vour;</HI> therefore their puni&s;hment will be endle&s;s and everla&s;ting.</P>
<P>They are filthy &s;till, unholy &s;till, impe|nitent &s;till; their hearts are as full of en|mity to God, hatred of holine&s;s, and love to &s;in as ever. Their puni&s;hment works no change in their nature or will. "They have abundant conviction indeed, but no true conver&s;ion. They are full of &s;orrow, but not godly &s;orrow. In all their bitter wailings their is no holy mourning". They grieve for their own mi&s;ery, but not for God's di&s;honour. If a new life was grant|ed them, it wou'd be fill'd up with new &s;ins and provocations. Nay, they keep on &s;inning &s;till. As <HI>Amon</HI> in his affliction, &s;o they in their mi&s;ery, <HI>tre&s;pa&s;s more and more.</HI> We have a true repre&s;entation of the condition and temper of the damned, in what we read of the antichri&s;tian idola|ters, the wor&s;hipers of the bea&s;t, Rev. xvi. 9, 10. <HI>They were &s;corched with great heat, and bla&s;phemed the name of God, which hath power ever the&s;e plagues, and they repented not to give him glory!

<P N="1">1. Some take an objection again&s;t this truth, from the <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of God; and wou'd repre&s;ent it as incon&s;i&s;|tent herewith, for God to puni&s;h the tran|&s;ient &s;ins of men in this mortal life, with eternal torments in another.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to whom it may be &s;aid, <HI>We</HI> are but very incompetent judges of what agrees with the ju&s;tice of God, and what does not. That may well eno' agree with this, and other the perfections of God, which we can &s;carcely apprehend to do &s;o.</P>
<P>But e&s;pecially are weincompetent judges in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, concerning the de&s;ert of &s;in; and this on two accounts. We are both <HI>blind</HI> and <HI>partial.</HI> We are <HI>blind and ignorant,</HI> and don't fully know the de&s;ert of &s;in; nor can we, unle&s;s we fully knew the maje&s;ty and greatne&s;s of that God it offends again&s;t, the rea&s;on and ho|line&s;s of that law which it violates, the excellency of that image of God which it defaceth, the preciou&s;ne&s;s of that blood which it tramples under foot, and counts an unholy thing, and the worth of that &s;oul which it de&s;pi&s;eth and de&s;troyeth. And we are as <HI>partial</HI> as we are blind; be|cau&s;e
<PB N="80" REF="003526_0081_0FF85736510D8A20">we our &s;elves are concerned in it. And as rea&s;onable is it for an offender and criminal, to judge the law and the proceedings of the judge, as for &s;inners to determine what is ju&s;t and righteous for God to do in the puni&s;hment of &s;in. But then, tho' the act be tran&s;ient and tem|porary, the injury and offence is objec|tively infinite, (as has been already ob|&s;erv'd) and &s;uch as the offence is mu&s;t the demerit be. A permanent guilt may al&s;o be contracted by a tran&s;ient act. "And, as one has well ob&s;erv'd, no go|vernment in the world ever tho't it a rule to be ob&s;erv'd in puni&s;hing, as required by equity and ju&s;tice, that the pain and pe|nalty inflicted, &s;hou'd la&s;t no longer than that &s;pace of time which the crime took up in the commi&s;&s;ion of it. Therefore &s;ome have been put to death from whence they can never be re&s;tor'd, and &s;ome have been bani&s;h'd or impri&s;on'd for a long time, perhaps during life, in puni&s;h|ment of crimes which were committed in a very &s;mall &s;pace of time, and yet no in|ju&s;tice imputed to the law or judges".</P>
<P>But that which fully clears the ju&s;tice and righteou&s;ne&s;s of God here is, That the &s;inner has but <HI>his own option and choice,</HI> tho' he &s;uffer everla&s;ting puni&s;hments.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="003526_0082_0FF8576E63731A90">
To u&s;e here the words of Mr. <HI>Baxter,</HI> <Q>Life and death, &s;ays he, felicity and mi|&s;ery, are &s;et before us in the &s;criptures: Felicity is annex'd to obedience, mi&s;ery to di&s;obedience; and God tells us, that accordingly he will judge and execute; and he offereth every man his choice. He therefore that after this doth chu&s;e the &s;in which mi&s;ery is annex'd to, doth chu&s;e the mi&s;ery and refu&s;e the happi|ne&s;s. And therefore it is no wrong to ca&s;t him into mi&s;ery, tho' everla&s;ting, as long as he hath nothing but what he cho&s;e (in the cau&s;es of it) and lo&s;es nothing but what he rejected, and that with wilful ob&s;tinacy to the very la&s;t.</Q> Thus he. And this is but agreable to what God him&s;elf &s;ays, Prov. i. 24, &mdash;31. <HI>Becau&s;e I have called, and ye refu&s;ed, I have &s;tretched out my hand, and no man regarded. But ye have &s;et at naught all my coun&s;el, and would none of my reproof. I al&s;o will laugh at your calamity, I will mock when your fear cometh. When your fear cometh as de&s;olati|on, and your de&s;truction cometh as a whirl|wind; when di&s;tre&s;s and angui&s;h cometh upon you. Then they &s;hall call upon me, but I will not an&s;wer, they &s;hall &s;eek me early, but they &s;hall not find me. For that they bated knowledge, and did not chu&s;e the fear
<PB N="82" REF="003526_0083_0FF85737E5B0A2C8">of the Lord. They would none of my coun|&s;el; they de&s;pi&s;ed all my reproof. Therefore &s;hall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Some will argue again&s;t this truth from the <HI>goodne&s;s</HI> and <HI>mercy</HI> of God, as if the&s;e cou'd not let any of his creatures be everla&s;tingly mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>To this it may be replied, Tho' God is good and merciful, infi|nitely good and merciful, yet his goodne&s;s and mercy don't work naturally and ne|ce&s;&s;arily, as the&s;e &s;eem to &s;uppo&s;e they do. There mu&s;t always be an act of his will, for the exerci&s;e of his goodne&s;s and mercy. God is a <HI>free agent,</HI> tho' a good and merciful being. He has e&s;tabli&s;h'd the order in which the&s;e attributes &s;hall be exercis'd, which he will not depart from: And he has a &s;overeign right to chu&s;e the objects thereof. Agreably he has &s;aid, <HI>I WILL HAVE MERCY, ON WHOM I WILL HAVE MERCY,</HI> Exod. xxxiii. 19. And of &s;ome he has &s;aid, <HI>I WILL NOT PITY THEM.</HI></P>
<P>The goodne&s;s and mercy of God will be exercis'd on the proper objects of it; but the damned in hell are <HI>not the proper objects thereof,</HI> and therefore his mercy may be withheld from them, and he re|main
<PB N="83" REF="003526_0084_0FF85770A6548BB8">merciful all the while. It is a very ju&s;t tho't I have met with, "Such things as are <HI>naturally</HI> capable of the divine good|ne&s;s, may be <HI>legally</HI> uncapable of it. And this is the ca&s;e of condemned &s;inners in another life. As creatures in mi&s;ery they are <HI>naturally</HI> capable of receiving the di|vine goodne&s;s and mercy, but as ob&s;tinate impenitent &s;inners, they are <HI>legally</HI> and <HI>ju|dicially</HI> uncapable to receive them.</P>
<P>We read 'tis true, That <HI>mercy rejoiceth again&s;t judgment,</HI> James ii. 13. A text which the&s;e &s;ort of per&s;ons make much u&s;e of again&s;t the truth we are upon; fondly imagining from thence that final|ly mercy alone will be di&s;play'd and &s;wallow up all in its own embraces. There will indeed be &s;ome who &s;hall be in&s;tan|ces of the triumph of mercy, being pre|par'd and qualified to receive it; in <HI>the&s;e</HI> mercy will rejoice again&s;t judgment. But that there &s;hall be no monuments of ju&s;|tice, as the&s;e wou'd carry it, this is far from the meaning of the text: And in|deed the ver&s;e out of which it is taken confutes them, and &s;uch an interpretati|on: For the former part of the ver&s;e &s;peaks of &s;ome who <HI>SHALL HAVE JUDGMENT WITHOUT MERCY.</HI></P>

3. Some oppo&s;e this truth on pretence of advancing the <HI>glory of God's grace:</HI> This they &s;ay wou'd be mightily di&s;play'd, in the final recovery of the <HI>whole apo&s;tate race,</HI> from their &s;in and mi&s;ery into a &s;tate of &s;alva|tion. To this let me &s;ay,</P>
<P>That God certainly be&s;t knows in what way his grace will be mo&s;t gloriou&s;ly di&s;|play'd, &amp; it becomes us to leave this to infi|nite wi&s;dom, &amp; &s;pare our own contrivances and projections. But after all, this wou'd <HI>le&s;&s;en</HI> and <HI>eclip&s;e,</HI> and not greaten and mag|nify the grace of God, as is pretended. For it is ju&s;tly ob&s;erv'd, "That the di&s;play of the glory of divine grace, does not con&s;i&s;t &s;o much in the extent of favour to a greater number of per&s;ons, as it does in its being <HI>free</HI> and <HI>unde&s;erv'd,</HI> and al&s;o <HI>&s;pecial</HI> and <HI>di&s;tingui&s;hing,</HI> and therefore laying the highe&s;t obligation on &s;uch as are concerned in it; which is the mo&s;t known and proper &s;en&s;e of the word <HI>grace.</HI> Surely the everla&s;ting puni&s;hment of &s;ome for their &s;ins, will render the grace of God to others, to the &s;aved rem|nant, the more glorious, and give a migh|ty lu&s;tre to it. So the rejection of the <HI>Jews,</HI> did mightily &s;et off the grace of God in the reception of the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> Rom. xi. 22. <HI>Behold the goodne&s;s and &s;everity of God; towards them &s;everity, but towards

<P>Indeed, the objects of redemption are &s;ometimes &s;poken of in &s;cripture, in &s;uch univer&s;al terms as the&s;e, <HI>all men, the world,</HI> the <HI>whole world.</HI> It is needful therefore to inquire into the meaning, the true and genuine &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e places, which &s;eem to a&s;&s;ert the univer&s;al redemption of the children of men; and whether diver&s;e re&s;trictions don't properly belong to them. Now, as to the term <HI>all,</HI> it is often us'd in &s;cripture, as well as in common &s;peech, when but a part, and &s;ometimes by far the le&s;&s;er part, of the &s;ubject &s;poken of, is intended. Of this it is ea&s;y to give many in&s;tances. Take the&s;e which follow; Mat. iii. 5, 6. <HI>Then went out to him,</HI> (i. e. <HI>John</HI>) <HI>Jeru&s;alem, and all Judea, and all the region round about Jordan, and were baptized of him.</HI> Surely none will under&s;tand this of every individual per&s;on in tho&s;e places, but of a con&s;iderable number only. It is &s;aid again, <HI>All men held John as a prophet,</HI> Mat. xxi. 26. "Whereas only a number did &s;o; for the &s;cribes and phari&s;ees did not, and many others who hated and per|&s;ecuted him.

<P>And as to the term <HI>world,</HI> or <HI>the whole world,</HI> divers re&s;trictions belong to it, and it has various acceptations in &s;cripture. I &s;hall not &s;tay to give you them all. It is &s;ufficient for our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e to &s;ay, that by <HI>the world,</HI> and <HI>the whole world,</HI> is frequently meant nothing more than all &s;orts of per&s;ons, without di&s;tinction of &s;ex, nation, e&s;tate, quality, or condition.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>phari&s;ees</HI> &s;aid of Chri&s;t, John xii. 19, <HI>The world is gone after him,</HI> i. e. all &s;orts and degrees of per&s;ons. And &s;ometimes it is to be under&s;tood of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> in di&s;tinction from the <HI>Jews.</HI> As, to give one in&s;tance, in Rom. xi. 12, the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>The fall of them,</HI> i. e. the <HI>Jews,</HI> is <HI>the riches of the world,</HI> i. e. the <HI>Gentiles;</HI> as is plain from the next words, which name the <HI>Gentiles</HI> in oppo&s;ition to the <HI>Jews.</HI> This will help us to under|&s;tand &s;uch places as that, in 1 John ii. 2, where 'tis &s;aid, <HI>Chri&s;t is the propitiation for our &s;ins; and not for ours only, but al&s;o for the &s;ins of the whole world.</HI> By which the A|po&s;tle means nothing more, than that Chri&s;t

And thus upon a due examination of tho&s;e &s;crip|tures upon which &s;ome found the doctrine of univer&s;al redemption, and con&s;idera|tion of the various limitations to which they are &s;ubject, it will appear they are by no means &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e to which they are bro't. I can't, within my pre&s;ent limits, enter into a particular ex|amination of them all; nor is it needful; for what has been already &s;aid, may &s;erve as an an&s;wer to many of them. But there are two or three, which I wou'd not pa&s;s over, becau&s;e they are main texts with &s;uch as hold the doctrine of univer|&s;al redemption, in oppo&s;ition to that which is &s;pecial and particular.</P>
<P>One is that, in 1 Cor. xv. 22. <HI>As in Adam all die, even &s;o in Chri&s;t &s;hall all be made alive.</HI> And as parallel to this, they mention Rom. v. 18, where 'tis &s;aid, <HI>As by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation, even &s;o by the righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of one, the free gift came upon all men to ju&s;tification of life.</HI> From hence they argue, That the benefit by <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is equal
<PB N="93" REF="003526_0094_0FF8577BCD1C79D0">to the damage by <HI>Adam;</HI> that ju&s;tificati|on and life by the &s;econd <HI>Adam,</HI> is as large and exten&s;ive as the condemnation and death by the fir&s;t. And &s;o it is, but not in their &s;en&s;e. The Apo&s;tle runs a parallel between the two <HI>Adams;</HI> and makes the fir&s;t to be a <HI>figure,</HI> or type<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign">.</NOTE> of the other, <HI>of him that was to come.</HI> And they are alike in many re&s;pects. Thus, <HI>Adam</HI> is a common head, &s;o is <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> Hence, as <HI>Adam</HI> hath a <HI>natural</HI> &s;eed, &s;o has <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> a <HI>&s;piritual</HI> &s;eed. And, as <HI>Adam</HI> ruin'd <HI>all</HI> his &s;eed, &s;o <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> has redeem'd <HI>all</HI> his. But here's the difference, (the not apprehending of which leads into the mi&s;take) all the natural &s;eed of <HI>Adam</HI> are not the &s;piritual &s;eed of <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> but a number &s;elected out of the other. There is a <HI>di&s;parity,</HI> as well as a parallel, between the two <HI>Adams.</HI> This the <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> allows, &s;aying, as in ver&s;e 15. <HI>But not as the of|fence, &s;o al&s;o is the free gift,</HI> i. e. there is a difference between the communication of death by the fir&s;t, and of life by the &s;econd Adam; and, among others, this is one, The gift of righteou&s;ne&s;s and life by the &s;econd <HI>Adam,</HI> does not extend to all the individuals that were ruin'd by
<PB N="94" REF="003526_0095_0FF857456E6DDD40">the offence of the fir&s;t. So that the com|pari&s;on is to be thus &s;tated and explained, <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> as <HI>effectually</HI> conveys life to <HI>all</HI> his &s;eed, as <HI>Adam</HI> did death to <HI>all</HI> his.</P>
<P>The other is that in Colo&s;. i. 20. <HI>And, (having made peace by the blood of his cro&s;s) by him to reconcile all things unto him&s;elf, by him, I &s;ay, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.</HI> This place is generally look'd upon to be of difficult interpretation, and has pretty much exer|cis'd annotators, and had various &s;en&s;es put upon it; and yet, if I may be allow'd with all humility to &s;hew my opinion, it admits of a very plain and ea&s;y interpre|tation, and I am ready to wonder at the difficulty which has been made about it. To <HI>me</HI> the meaning is only this, "That all things which are reconcil'd to God, are &s;o by <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> which things &s;o reconciled by him, are in heaven and in earth". For the term <HI>all</HI> is often u&s;ed to &s;ignifie only tho&s;e who are the objects of the thing done for them. As for in&s;tance, when 'tis &s;aid, (P&s;alm cxlv. 14.) <HI>The Lord upholdeth all that fall, and rai&s;eth up all tho&s;e that are bowed down.</HI> It can't be under&s;tood as if God rais'd up every in|dividual per&s;on in the world, that is bow|ed down by the weight of trouble and
<PB N="95" REF="003526_0096_0FF8577E9D480C48">affliction; for &s;ome do &s;ink under their burden: but the meaning is, that all who are rais'd up when bowed down, are &s;o by God. Thus, when 'tis &s;aid God has reconciled all things to him&s;elf by Chri&s;t; the meaning is not that <HI>all things,</HI> all creatures that ever offended him, <HI>are ac|tually reconciled;</HI> but that all who are made partakers of this ble&s;&s;ed privilege of reconciliation, are &s;o by <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> who made peace by the blood of his cro&s;s. And the&s;e <HI>things,</HI> the&s;e creatures &s;o reconciled, are <HI>in heaven &amp; in earth;</HI> one part of them the Apo&s;tle con&s;iders as being in heaven, and the other part of them on earth, in their way to it. So that he here means the whole company of redeemed &s;inners, who are el&s;ewhere called the <HI>family in heaven, and in earth,</HI> Eph. iii. 15.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) It may be inquired, Whether Chri&s;t died for the <HI>&s;inning angels,</HI> or <HI>devils;</HI> whether <HI>their redemption</HI> was at all intend|ed in his death? And there is nothing in &s;cripture on which to found &s;uch an opi|nion, but the contrary. The Apo&s;tle &s;peak|ing of Chri&s;t (Heb. ii. 16.) &s;ays, <HI>Verily, He took not on him the nature of angels: but he tock on him the &s;eed of Abraham.</HI> Or, as the margin of &s;ome of our bibles reads it, <HI>He taketh not hold of angels, but of the &s;eed
<PB N="96" REF="003526_0097_0FF857485BF5CA88">Abraham he taketh hold.</HI> The angels fell, and he let them go, without putting out the arm of mercy to recover them; and &s;uffers them to lie in their fall without hope or help. Chri&s;t never de&s;ign'd to be the Saviour of fallen angels, and there|fore did not a&s;&s;ume their nature. He is &s;aid to <HI>de&s;troy</HI> &s;atan by his death, but not to <HI>&s;ave</HI> him. The 14th ver&s;e of that chapter, <HI>That thro' death he might de&s;troy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil.</HI> Satan knew that he &s;hou'd have no benefit by Chri&s;t, and this was what made him &s;o full of &s;pight, rage and hor|ror when Chri&s;t came into the world. <HI>What have we to do with thee, Je&s;us, thou &s;on of God? Thou art come hither,</HI> not to &s;ave, but <HI>to torment us before the time,</HI> Mat. viii. 29. And therefore it is that he &s;o oppo&s;es Chri&s;t's kingdom and intere&s;t in the world to this day.</P>
<P N="2">2. The other thing to be inquir'd into is, <HI>Whether there are any offers of &s;alvation made to the devils, and condemned &s;inners in the place of puni&s;hment?</HI> No, verily! They never had, nor never will have any &s;uch offer. The &s;cripture &s;peaks of the pre|&s;ent day of life, as the day of grace and probation, as the <HI>accepted time</HI> and <HI>day
<PB N="97" REF="003526_0098_0FF85780CDF74970">of &s;alvation</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. iii. 7 xiii. 1. 2 Cor. vi 2. I&s;ai. lv. 6.

I&s;ai. xxxviii. 18. <HI>The grave cannot prai&s;e thee, death cannot celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.</HI> As the go&s;pel which we now have in our hands is the <HI>la&s;t di&s;|pen&s;ation,</HI> &s;o the time of life which we now enjoy is the <HI>only &s;ea&s;on</HI> of grace. Yet &s;ome would fain have the go&s;pel preach'd in hell, and try to make the &s;criptures &s;ay &s;o. The places they bring for this pur|po&s;e, are e&s;pecially two.</P>
<P>One is that, in 1 Pet. iii. 18, 19, 20. <HI>For Chri&s;t al&s;o hath once &s;uffered for &s;ins, the ju&s;t for the unju&s;t, (that he might bring us to God) being put to death in the fle&s;h, but quickned by the &s;pirit. By which</HI> [Spirit] <HI>al&s;o he went and preached unto the &s;pirits in pri&s;on; which &s;ometime were di&s;obedient, when once the long-&s;uffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing</HI> &mdash;. The meaning of which place is this, That <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> before his own coming in the fle&s;h, did &s;end <HI>Noah,</HI> that <HI>preacher of righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and by His Spirit enabled him to preach to the old world, who were di&s;obedient, and for their di&s;o|bedience,
<PB N="98" REF="003526_0099_0FF857A330E2E480">their bodies being drown'd by the flood, their &s;pirits were &s;ent to the pri&s;on of hell, after the long-&s;uffering of God had waited on them, while the ark was building. In <HI>Noah</HI>'s time, when they were preach'd to by the Spirit of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in his mini&s;try, they were on earth, but in <HI>Peter</HI>'s time, when he wrote of them, they were in <HI>hell,</HI> and therefore he calls them <HI>&s;pirits in pri&s;on;</HI> and this preaching to them was <HI>while</HI> they were on earth, not <HI>after</HI> they were in hell. See <HI>Gen.</HI> vi. 3. and 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> ii. 5. compared with this place.</P>
<P>The other is that, in 1 Pet. iv. 6. <HI>For, for this cau&s;e was the go&s;pel preached to them that are dead, that they might be judged ac|cording to men in the fle&s;h, but live accord|ing to God in the &s;pirit.</HI> If by the <HI>dead</HI> here are meant &s;uch as are <HI>naturally</HI> dead, by a di&s;&s;olution of &s;oul and body, it means the faithful of old, to whom the go&s;pel was preach'd when alive on earth, but are now dead in Chri&s;t. The words can have no relation to the preaching of the go&s;pel to any of the dead in <HI>Hades,</HI> in the &s;eparate &s;tate, for it is &s;poken of as a thing already pa&s;t and over with them.

But if the&s;e interpretations &s;hou'd not give us the true and genuine meaning of the&s;e texts, it makes nothing at all for tho&s;e who wou'd put &s;uch a perver&s;e &s;en&s;e upon 'em as we are now oppo&s;ing.

To conclude this head, The &s;cripture gives us to under&s;tand, that when <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> &s;hall appear in the great day of judgment, his church will be perfected, his my&s;tical bo|dy fill'd up with all the members that are to be added to it; the number of his elect compleated; and &s;o be pre&s;ented to his father in &s;uch words as the&s;e, <HI>Behold, here I am, and the children which thou ha&s;t given me:</HI> and not one will be mi&s;&s;ing of all the &s;ons and daughters he was to bring to glory.

<P N="1">1. How <HI>great</HI> and <HI>terrible a God</HI> is He with whom we have to do!

Let us have grace, whereby we may &s;erve God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear: For our God is a con&s;uming fire.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>How great an evil mu&s;t &s;in be!</HI> Hell is the ju&s;t demerit of &s;in. It is &s;in that
<PB N="103" REF="003526_0104_0FF857B4B4ACF858">has dug the pit of hell, and fill'd it with fire and brim&s;tone; that turns &s;ouls into it, and keeps them in it for ever and ever. It mu&s;t then it &s;elf be a dreadful evil, of a mo&s;t vile and accur&s;ed nature. Since the puni&s;hment of &s;inners in the next life will be extreme and eternal, &s;in is certainly another kind of thing, than is commonly imagined. O! You that have light tho'ts of &s;in, look into the place of torments, the bottomle&s;s pit; behold the trea&s;ures of wrath that are there prepar'd to puni&s;h the workers of it; hearken to the groans and cries of tho&s;e who are there reaping the fruit of their doings: And then &s;ay what is to be tho't of &s;in. We mu&s;t look into <HI>hell</HI> to know what &s;in is: And even then we &s;han't fully know what an evil it is. For it may be truly &s;aid of &s;in, <HI>it is deeper than hell, what can&s;t thou know?</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. We learn what it is that <HI>makes death &s;o formidable a thing.</HI> It is this, That to the wicked, &s;uch as die in their &s;ins, <HI>hell follows after</HI> it. The <HI>&s;ting of death</HI> is &s;aid to be <HI>&s;in,</HI> (1 Cor. xv. 56.) becau&s;e &s;in binds over to a puni&s;hment after death. If death was not to mo&s;t men an intro|duction to future endle&s;s mi&s;ery, but only an extinction of their pre&s;ent being, it
<PB N="104" REF="003526_0105_0FF8578252DF6008">wou'd not be the king of terrors. 'Tis the <HI>&s;econd</HI> death which gives the &s;ting and terror to the <HI>fir&s;t.

Second USE, by way of <HI>coun&s;el</HI> and <HI>advice.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Let us be <HI>firmly per&s;waded</HI> of the&s;e awful truths, and <HI>admit no &s;ugge&s;tion</HI> tend|ing to &s;hake our belief of them. It is an age of infidelity, in which temptations of this kind do abound; all had need therefore be upon their guard, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who are young. Take the <HI>doctrine of future puni&s;hments</HI> as it is reveal'd in the word of God, and be <HI>&s;tabli&s;h'd in the faith</HI> of it <HI>as ye have been taught.</HI> The <HI>eternity</HI> of them is what men are mo&s;t apt to quarrel with. But, I think, eno' has been &s;aid, to convince and &s;atisfie any one that be|lieves the word of God, and has not learnt to wrangle away the plaine&s;t truths. And &s;uch as will not believe <HI>God</HI> &s;peaking in his <HI>word,</HI> neither would they believe if he &s;hou'd &s;end an <HI>angel</HI> from heaven to them. For <HI>his</HI> word might as well be que&s;tion'd. An angel can &s;peak but the word of God; and if <HI>an angel was to bring any other go&s;pel,</HI> you are not to receive it, but to hold him accur&s;ed. <HI>Gal.</HI> i. 8.</P>
<P>The denial of the eternity of the pu|ni&s;hment of the wicked, is indeed &s;ubver|&s;ive of practical religion. It takes off from men the highe&s;t re&s;traint, and opens a door to all licentiou&s;ne&s;s. It takes away
<PB N="110" REF="003526_0111_0FF85789A61F8D50">that fear in which we &s;hou'd pa&s;s the time of our &s;ojourning in this world, and with which we &s;hou'd be working out our own &s;alvation. It tends to make men de&s;pi&s;e the pre&s;ent offers, and refu&s;e the pre&s;ent calls of the go&s;pel; and to be carele&s;s of the things of their peace in this the day of them. They that give into it then, do err concerning the truth in a very <HI>dan|gerous point.</HI> The doctrines of the go&s;pel are all of them <HI>according to godline&s;s,</HI> tend|ing to promote that. Whatever doctrine is manife&s;tly otherwi&s;e, carries with it an evident mark of its fal&s;ene&s;s, and proves it &s;elf that it can never be of God, and is therefore to be rejected with abhorrence, and &s;uch as would propagate it to be a|voided. 1 Tim. vi. 3, 4, 5. <HI>If any man teach otherwi&s;e, and con&s;ent not to whole|&s;ome words, even the words of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and to the doctrine which is according to godline&s;s, He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about que&s;tions and &s;trifes of words &mdash;: From &s;uch withdraw thy &s;elf.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Let us <HI>often remember them,</HI> and have them much in our tho'ts. Let the belief of the&s;e things produce frequent &s;erious con&s;i|deration upon them. The believing realizing con&s;ideration of the puni&s;hments of hell, if
<PB N="111" REF="003526_0112_0FF857BD8C64CA60">we &s;ometimes &s;et our &s;elves to it, might, by the ble&s;&s;ing of the &s;pirit of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, have ve|ry good effects. It would help to di&s;co|ver the deceitfulne&s;s of &s;in, and to weak|en the force of temptations: It might &s;erve to awaken us out of carnal &s;ecurity, and to quicken us in the working out our own &s;alvation. Indeed, the <HI>love of God</HI> is the acceptable principle; and is what &s;hould <HI>re&s;train</HI> us from &s;in, and <HI>con&s;train</HI> us to duty. Yet we <HI>may,</HI> and have <HI>need</HI> to call in and improve the con&s;ideration of the torments of hell. <HI>This motive</HI> the &s;inner u&s;ually feels the force of at his fir&s;t conver&s;ion, in the beginning of a re|ligious life; and it is of u&s;e to us thro' the whole of our chri&s;tian cour&s;e, even when we come to act, in the main, from a high|er and better principle. <HI>Job</HI> was a man of &s;ingular piety, yet was re&s;train'd from &s;in, by this principle: <HI>For de&s;truction from God was a terror to me,</HI> chap. xxxi. 23. They that <HI>hope</HI> for God's <HI>&s;alvation,</HI> &s;hou'd yet <HI>fear</HI> his <HI>de&s;truction. "Adam</HI> in inno|cency was aw'd with a threatning.</P>
<P N="3">3. Let it be the <HI>great concern,</HI> and mo&s;t <HI>&s;erious endeavour</HI> of us all, <HI>to e&s;cape the pu|ni&s;hments of hell.</HI> For this end they are &s;et before us in the word of God. <HI>Know|ing therefore the terror of the Lord,</HI> let us be
<PB N="112" REF="003526_0113_0FF8578BC83D8710">per&s;waded to break of our &s;ins by righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, and to turn out of the broad way that leads to de&s;truction! &mdash; Let us cry earne&s;tly to God for mercy, and &s;ue out a pardon at the throne of grace! &mdash; Let us flie to the <HI>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and take <HI>&s;anctuary</HI> in him by faith! For there is no door of e&s;cape open for a guil|ty &s;inner, but in and thro' <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> and in him there is a <HI>wide and effectual door open|ed,</HI> to one that is flying from the wrath to come. O for a <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> or we are undone for ever! O for that believing covenant|ing act to make him ours!</P>
<P>And let us do all this &s;peedily and without delay; and not put off the prac|ti&s;ing the coun&s;els of God to the la&s;t ex|tremities, le&s;t we bewail our folly to no purpo&s;e, as multitudes are now doing, in a mi&s;erable eternity. The door is open to <HI>day,</HI> but it may be &s;hut to <HI>morrow;</HI> and being <HI>once</HI> &s;hut, it is &s;hut <HI>for ever. Wherefore as the</HI> HOLY GHOST <HI>&s;aith, To day while it is called to day, harden not your hearts.</HI></P>
<P>Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour after he had <HI>warn|ed</HI> his hearers of <HI>the wrath to come,</HI> and thereupon exhorted them to <HI>bring forth fruits meet for repentance,</HI> enforces all with this &s;olemn declaration, wherein he lets them know what terms they &s;tood upon, and what continual danger they were in,
<PB N="113" REF="003526_0114_0FF857BFF0DF17D8"><HI>The ax is now laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down, and ca&s;t into the fire,</HI> Mat. iii. 10. Profe&s;&s;ors in the vi&s;ible church, are <HI>trees</HI> in God's vineyard, from whom he expects good fruit, fruits meet for repentance, the fruits of righteou&s;ne&s;s which are by Je&s;us Chri&s;t to the prai&s;e and glory of God. If they fail his ju&s;t expectations concerning them, are barren and ungodly, bringing forth <HI>no</HI> fruit, or which is wor&s;e <HI>bad</HI> fruit, wild grapes, the grapes of <HI>Sodom,</HI> and the clu&s;ters of <HI>Go|morrow,</HI> their ruin is inevitable, and is &s;peedily coming on. They may every moment expect ju&s;tice will <HI>&s;trike the fatal blow,</HI> cut them down as unworthy to &s;tand any longer in the vineyard, and ca&s;t them as dry &s;tubble into the unquenchable fire of divine wrath. Take therefore the aw|ful admonition, Jer. xiii. 16. <HI>Give glory to the Lord your God before he cau&s;e darkne&s;s, and before your fect &s;tumble on the dark moun|tains, and while ye look for light, he turn it into the &s;hadow of death, and make it gro&s;s darkne&s;s.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>If any now think the doctrine we have been upon to be har&s;h and grievous, 'tis <HI>not ours</HI> but <HI>God's.</HI> And we mu&s;t &s;peak with <HI>his words,</HI> whether men will hear,
<PB N="114" REF="003526_0115_0FF8578D8F5F7878">or whether they will forbear. Should we tell you otherwi&s;e, we &s;hould but deceive you with a lie, and hurt our own &s;ouls as well as yours. But when we <HI>&s;peak as the oracles of God,</HI> it is time for <HI>him that hath ears, to hear.</HI> And &s;urely 'tis ea&s;ier to <HI>hear</HI> of the puni&s;hments of hell than to <HI>feel</HI> them. If you don't ca&s;t this truth out of your minds by forgetfulne&s;s or unbe|lief, it may, by the ble&s;&s;ing of the Spirit, work to your conver&s;ion and &s;alvation. Then you will have your belief of it con|firm'd, and it will be &s;o far from being a <HI>terror</HI> to you, that it will furni&s;h you with matter of <HI>comfort</HI> and <HI>prai&s;e</HI> to think, that thro' grace, you are deliver'd from the de|vouring fire, and from the everla&s;ting burnings.</P>
<P>However let carele&s;s ob&s;tinate &s;inners know to their &s;orrow, tho' they may put this truth <HI>out of their minds,</HI> they can't put it <HI>out of their bibles;</HI> but there it will &s;tand as a &s;ealed truth, which they &s;hall experi|mentally know in the future world, that the wicked <HI>SHALL GO AWAY INTO EVERLASTING PUNISHMENT, and THE SMOKE OF THEIR TORMENT ASCEND FOR EVER AND EVER.</HI></P>

<P>_THESE words are a prayer of holy <HI>David;</HI> a very needful prayer, &s;utably and importu|nately made; and which we &s;hou'd all learn of him to make for our &s;elves.

1. The <HI>matter</HI> of the prayer, or the <HI>ble&s;&s;ing</HI> pray'd for and ask'd; and this is <HI>divine in&s;truction.</HI> A ble&s;&s;ing of no &s;mall importance, of no le&s;s than infinite con|cernment: <HI>Lead me in thy truth, and teach me.</HI> He &s;peaks in the language of one <HI>ignorant,</HI> or of one at <HI>a lo&s;s;</HI> of one in <HI>danger</HI> of being led a&s;ide, of erring and mi&s;taking; of one &s;en&s;ible that if <HI>left to him&s;elf</HI> he &s;hould go out of the way of truth; of one &s;incerely de&s;irous to be <HI>rightly informed,</HI> and who therefore appli|ed him&s;elf to a <HI>divine in&s;tructor.</HI> He looks above men, to <HI>the father of lights,</HI> from whom comes down every good and perfect gift, who&s;e Spirit is the &s;pirit of wi&s;dom and revelation: <HI>Lead me in thy truth, and teach me!</HI> Let me have a clear under&s;tanding of thy mind and will!

He <HI>had been</HI> happily taught of God; cou'd &s;ay, <HI>O God, thou ha&s;t taught me from my youth;</HI> yet was de&s;irous to be taught <HI>more</HI> and

<P N="2">2.

<P N="1">1. To &s;hew what we are to under&s;tand here by <HI>God's truth.</HI> By God's truth here we are to under&s;tand his <HI>mind</HI> and <HI>will,</HI> as it is reveal'd in the &s;acred &s;criptures, concerning mans pre&s;ent duty and future happine&s;s. REVEAL'D RELIGION, that is God's truth; for it comes from him as the ble&s;&s;ed author of it, contains <HI>the coun|&s;el of his will,</HI> and is the only true religi|on, the only way to heaven and happi|ne&s;s. John xvii. 17. <HI>Thy word is truth.</HI> This contains <HI>two</HI> main parts, the one <HI>doctrinal,</HI> the other <HI>practical;</HI> and <HI>both</HI> are God's truth.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>doctrinal</HI> part of religion is to be under&s;tood by God's truth. This is what contains <HI>things which are mo&s;t &s;urely to be believed by us.</HI> It is call'd <HI>the faith d liver'd to the &s;aints,</HI> as a &s;acred tru&s;t, for them to <HI>keep</HI> with care, and <HI>defend</HI> with earne&s;tne&s;s, <HI>Jude</HI> ver&s;e 3.

<PB N="5" REF="003526_0122_0FF857C92D4DE298">greater moment and importance than o|ther; yea, of &s;uch moment that without the belief of them, we can't be good chri&s;tians, or intitled to &s;alvation. Many of them are <HI>incomprehen&s;ible</HI> by us, <HI>above</HI> rea&s;on tho' not <HI>contrary</HI> to it; and are therefore called <HI>my&s;teries, the my&s;teries of the kingdom of heaven.</HI> Yea, the whole &s;y&s;tem of go&s;pel truths, is for this rea&s;on called <HI>the my&s;tery of faith,</HI> 1 Tim. iii. 9.

<P N="2">2. The <HI>practical</HI> part of religion is al&s;o to be under&s;tood here by God's truth. This contains in it the <HI>&s;tatutes</HI> and <HI>com|mandments</HI> of the Lord our God; and is the rule of our <HI>life,</HI> as the other is the rule of our <HI>faith.</HI> P&s;alm cxix. 142. <HI>Thy law is truth.</HI> By the former we are to regulate our <HI>judgment,</HI> by the latter we are to order our <HI>conver&s;ation.</HI> And the former hath a powerful influence upon the latter; and is therefore called <HI>the doc|trine which is according to godline&s;s,</HI> 1 Ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. vi. 3. which tends to promote godline&s;s, to make men live godly in this pre&s;ent world. This is the truth which we mu&s;t be <HI>led in,</HI> mu&s;t <HI>walk in.</HI> Agreably, a life
<PB N="6" REF="003526_0123_0FF8579721CB5248">of practical godline&s;s is called <HI>a walking in truth, as we have received a command|ment from the father,</HI> 2 John 4. But the former of the&s;e, viz. <HI>Doctrinal Truth,</HI> is what I wou'd be under&s;tood chiefly to intend, and &s;hall principally refer to in the pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">II. To &s;hew what we are to under&s;tand by our being <HI>led in this truth.</HI> It means the&s;e two things at lea&s;t, our being <HI>bro't into</HI> it, and <HI>kept in</HI> it.</P>
<P N="1">1. Our being <HI>bro't into</HI> the truth. This includes <HI>knowledge</HI> and <HI>a&s;&s;ent.</HI> God leads tho&s;e into his truth, whom he helps to under&s;tand the truths of the go&s;pel, with the grounds and rea&s;ons of them, and from an inward per&s;ua&s;ion of their verity, o|penly to own and profe&s;s them: To whom he gives a <HI>&s;ound judgment,</HI> by which they do di&s;cern truth from error, and do ac|cordingly embrace the one, and reject the other.</P>
<P N="2">2. Our being <HI>kept in</HI> it.

The &s;criptures of the old and new te&s;ta|ment contain the outward revelation of God's mind and will; they teach us "what we are to believe concerning God, and what duty God requires of us. And in them God doth as really teach us, as if he were our immediate monitor.

Mini|&s;ters are therefore to &s;tudy this word, and in their preaching to keep clo&s;e to it.

1. We &s;hall <HI>never rightly know the truth,</HI> if God does not teach us and lead us into it. Truth is a precious jewel, a pearl of great price, which the mind of man has a natural de&s;ire after, and is in que&s;t of; and that we find it, is of the la&s;t impor|tance to us. For the knowledge of the truth is the foundation of religion, and is the fir&s;t &s;tep to &s;alvation. 1 Tim. ii. 4. <HI>Who will have all men to be &s;aved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.</HI> A true chri&s;tian is one that believes the doctrines, as well as obeys the precepts of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and the former is as nece&s;&s;ary as the latter. <HI>With the heart man believes un|to righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> Rom. x. 9. But we &s;hall never know them to a &s;aving purpo&s;e, &s;hall never heartily believe, embrace, ac|quie&s;ce in, and live upon them, without a divine teaching. Neither <HI>natural rea&s;on,</HI> nor <HI>humane teaching</HI> are &s;ufficient for this; as has been already hinted. Hence the greate&s;t ma&s;ters of rea&s;on and learning, are many times mo&s;t ignorant in, or the greate&s;t de&s;pi&s;ers of go&s;pel my&s;teries. <HI>Ni|codemus, a ma&s;ter in I&s;rael,</HI> could not re|ceive Chri&s;t's doctrine of &s;piritual rege|neration.

<P N="2">2. The danger we are in of being led into <HI>contrary errors,</HI> &s;hould make us &s;eek of God to <HI>teach us and lead us into his truth.</HI> There is truth, and there is error.

We had need therefore &s;eek divine teaching, that &s;o we may di&s;cern the things that differ, and may approve only things that are ex|cellent. Errors in religion are dangerous, tho' &s;ome more than others; and &s;ome of

<P>Indeed in this day of abounding errors, no little pains are taken by &s;ome, to per|&s;uade men that truth and error are indiffer|ent things; that 'tis no matter what opi|nions a man holds, if he does but lead, what they are pleas'd to call (in a &s;en&s;e unevangelical eno') an hone&s;t and good life. In this way &s;ome late celebrated Writers, have &s;hewn their enmity to <HI>or|thodoxy,</HI> to <HI>creeds,</HI> and <HI>confe&s;&s;ions of faith;</HI> and wou'd prepare men to receive their own corrupt opinions.

To what end does the Holy Spirit &s;o ear|ne&s;tly exhort us <HI>not to be deceiv'd; to buy the truth, and not to &s;ell it;</HI> to <HI>beware of &s;e|ducers;</HI> to <HI>&s;hun philo&s;ophy and vain deceit;</HI> to <HI>hold fa&s;t the form of &s;ound words,</HI> to <HI>con|tinue in the faith, grounded, and &s;ettled;</HI> and <HI>to take heed le&s;t being led away with the er|ror of the wicked, we fall from our own &s;ted|fa&s;tne&s;s;</HI> and therefore to <HI>prove all things,</HI> and to <HI>hold fa&s;t what is good.</HI> And why

<P N="4">(4.)

<P N="5">(5) The teachings of God are <HI>trans|forming.</HI> They transform the &s;oul into another image than it had before.

I &s;hall there|fore add nothing further by way of <HI>motive,</HI> but only by way of <HI>direction,</HI> in a few hints of importance to be ob&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>Briefly then,</P>
<P N="1">1. Be <HI>carne&s;t</HI> and <HI>importunate</HI> in &s;eeking this. A cold wi&s;h or two, that God wou'd teach us his truth, is not an&s;werable to the importance of the thing. This is a matter of <HI>prime importance,</HI> of <HI>infinite concernment,</HI> in which our <HI>&s;alvation</HI> is concern'd, as is &s;ugge&s;ted to us in the text; and we &s;hou'd &s;eek it of God with an an&s;werable impre&s;|&s;ion upon our &s;pirits, with &s;uch a deep and inward concern as is agreeable to the momentous &s;ubject. <HI>If thou crie&s;t after knowledge, and lifte&s;t up thy voice for under|&s;tanding, then &s;halt thou find the knowledge of God,</HI> Prov. ii. 4, 5.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>Continue &s;eeking. Continue in prayer and watch in the &s;ame with thank&s;giving.</HI> Our <HI>daily con&s;tant</HI> prayer &s;hould be of this import, <HI>Lead me in thy truth and teach me.</HI> One of the <HI>pleas</HI> with which this pe|tition is urg'd in the text, &s;peaks a <HI>con&s;tant</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="003526_0140_0FF857DDDF3935B8"><HI>attendance</HI> upon God in the way of duty. <HI>On thee do I wait all the day.</HI> "It &s;ig|nifies <HI>all the day long,</HI> and <HI>every day.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. To prayer join the <HI>u&s;e of other God's appointed means.</HI> Study the word of God, for his <HI>word is truth;</HI> and u&s;e the be&s;t helps you can for the right under&s;tanding of it. <HI>Under&s;tande&s;t thou what thou reade&s;t?</HI> &s;aid <HI>Phillip</HI> to the <HI>Eunuch.</HI> He an&s;wered, <HI>How can I, except &s;ome man &s;hould guide me?</HI> Acts viii. 30, 31. The <HI>expo&s;itions</HI> of holy and learned men, are to be us'd with thankfulne&s;s and prayer for our better un|der&s;tanding the &s;criptures. And thus the <HI>&s;tated mini&s;try</HI> of the word is al&s;o to be at|tended. It is an apo&s;tolical cautionary direction, 1 The&s;. v. 20. <HI>De&s;pi&s;e not pro|phecyings,</HI> i.e. ordinary preaching, the word opened and applied by mini&s;ters in chri&s;ti|an a&s;&s;emblies. God not only gave extraordi|nary officers to his church, but ordinary, <HI>pa&s;|tors and teachers, for the perfecting of the &s;aints, for the work of the mini&s;try, for the edifying the body of Chri&s;t, till we all come in the u|nity of the faith, and the knowledge of the &s;on of God, unto a perfect man, to the mea|&s;ure of the &s;tature of the fulne&s;s of Chri&s;t,</HI> Eph. iv. 10, 11. The&s;e ends being to be an&s;wer'd <HI>now,</HI> as well as heretofore, the office continues: And their mini&s;trations are to
<PB N="24" REF="003526_0141_0FF857AB97096660">be attended on as an ordinance of God. As we &s;hould not <HI>re&s;t in</HI> the teachings of men, &s;o we &s;hould not think our &s;elves <HI>above</HI> them. For God is pleas'd to own and ble&s;s them, for the end whereto he has appoin|ted them. Mini&s;ters are <HI>workers together</HI> with God, as <HI>helpers of your faith and joy. Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but mini&s;ters by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?</HI> 1 Cor. iii. 5.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Indulge nothing that hath a tendency to lead you a&s;tray from truth;</HI> to bya&s;s your judgment, and give a wrong bent to your mind. Beware of all <HI>&s;ecret prejudices.</HI> En|deavour to mortifie <HI>pride, &s;elf-conceit,</HI> and an <HI>affectation of novelty. Grieve not the ho|ly Spirit of God</HI> by any &s;in, le&s;t he be pro|vok'd to leave you to a &s;pirit of delu&s;ion.</P>
<P N="5">5, and la&s;tly, Be very careful to <HI>live up to what you do know, and profe&s;s to believe. Practical holine&s;s,</HI> (as one &s;ays,) is an excel|lent means for the maintaining of <HI>doctrinal orthodoxy. Solomon</HI> tells us, 'tis for the <HI>righteous that God layeth up &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">und wi&s;dom,</HI> Prov. ii. 7. And again, <HI>He giveth to tho&s;e that are good in his &s;ight, wi&s;dom and know|ledge,</HI> Eccl. ii. 26: And our Saviou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> him|&s;elf tells us, John vii. 17. <HI>If any man will do his will, he &s;hall know of the doctrine, whether it of God, or whether I &s;peak of
<PB N="25" REF="003526_0142_0FF857E01C0B9890">my &s;elf.</HI> "Such as follow the guidance of the Spirit in the cour&s;e of their lives, &s;hall have him to regulate their judgments: And they that are govern'd by him as a &s;pirit of holine&s;s, &s;hall be in&s;tructed by him as a &s;pirit of truth".</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this di&s;cour&s;e, with giv|ing you one <HI>&s;hort rule,</HI> whereby to try and judge of doctrines whether they be of God. <HI>Tho&s;e doctrines which tend mo&s;t to deba&s;e and humble man, and to exalt and magnifie free grace, are mo&s;t likely to be of God.</HI> The rea&s;on is becau&s;e this is what God aims at in the contrivance of fallen man's redemp|tion. To this the whole frame is admira|bly fitted, from the fir&s;t <HI>corner &s;tone,</HI> to the bringing forth the <HI>top &s;tone</HI> thereof. 1 Cor. i. 29, 30, 31. <HI>That no fle&s;h &s;hould glory in his pre&s;ence. But of him are ye in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who of God is made unto us wi&s;dom, and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;anctification, and re|demption: That, according as it is written, Let him that glorieth, glory in the Lord.</HI> Eph. ii. 7, 8, 9. <HI>That in the ages to come he might &s;hew the exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindne&s;s towards us thro' Chri&s;t Je&s;us. For by grace are ye &s;aved, thro' faith; and that not of your &s;elves: it is the gift of God. N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t of works, le&s;t any man &s;hould boa&s;t.</HI></P>

An excellent writer, upon that an&s;wer which <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> gave to <HI>Peter</HI> when he had confe&s;s'd his divinity, <HI>Fle&s;h and blood hath not revealed it to thee, but my father in hea|ven,</HI> hath the&s;e words which I think worth tran&s;cribing, <Q>It is no recommending character of any doctrine, that it is plea&s;|ing and &s;utable to fle&s;h and blood. We have rea&s;on to be jealous that it is no &s;piritual truth, which the natural man very readily receives. The doctrines which are promoted and countenanced by fle&s;h and blood, have the &s;u&s;picious mark upon them of accur&s;ed doctrines. 'Tis no argument why I &s;hould give credit to this or that opinion, becau&s;e 'tis grateful to nature, but rather an ar|gument again&s;t it. The &s;wift progre&s;s of error is owing very much to its &s;mooth concurrence with the &s;tream of nature. It is ill judging after the fle&s;h, they judge be&s;t and mo&s;t wi&s;ely, that judge contrary to it.</Q></P>
