<P>The very Life of a Chri&s;tian mu&s;t be a <HI>Life of Repentance.</HI> It is not enough, that a man <HI>Repent once</HI> in his Life, The Di&s;po&s;itions of <HI>Repentance</HI> mu&s;t <HI>Always</HI> be <HI>kept Alive,</HI> in a man, as long as he <HI>Lives.</HI> A Good man mu&s;t over and over again <HI>Repent</HI> of his <HI>Evil-doing,</HI> and <HI>hold on Repenting</HI> all his Days.

<PB N="7" REF="001462_0009_0FB34A5520A15908">
<HI>Nulli rei natus, ni&s;i Pe|nitentiae; <HI>Born to be in the Repenting Strain continually;</HI></HI> Never, Never to be out of it!</P>
<P>The Fir&s;t Thing to be now done, is, to Enquire,</P>
<P><HI>What is that <HI>Repentance,</HI> which we are to keep in continual Exerci&s;e?</HI></P>
<P>I will briefly &s;tate the Operations of that <HI>Repentance.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t; In <HI>Repentance,</HI> tis to be &s;uppo&s;ed, we are Apprehen&s;ive, <HI>That we have Sinned;</HI> That we have been or done, that which is to be <HI>Repented</HI> of. An Apprehen&s;ion of our <HI>Sinfulne&s;s</HI> is nece&s;&s;ary. A <HI>Repenting</HI> Sinner, is a <HI>Convinced</HI> Sinner. The Language of <HI>Repentance,</HI> is that; 2 Sam. 24.10. <HI>I have Sinned greatly in that I have done, I have done very Fooli&s;hly.</HI> Tis implied, That we are acquainted with the <HI>Law</HI> of our GOD; That we have an Acquain|tance with what the <HI>Exceeding Broad Law</HI> Enjoyns upon us. We mu&s;t &s;ee the <HI>Law</HI> of GOD <HI>Violated,</HI> in what we have been, or done; A <HI>Law</HI> to be <HI>for ever Magnified and made Honourable.</HI> The Fir&s;t Thing &s;aid by a <HI>Repenting</HI> Sinner,
<PB N="8" REF="001462_0010_0FB34A57666F4B60">
is that, Luk. 15.17. <HI>I have Sinned again&s;t Heaven.</HI> But if we would not &s;infully <HI>Intermit</HI> our due <HI>Repentance,</HI> we mu&s;t &s;ee our &s;elves thus Chargeable with <HI>Sin,</HI> in <HI>all</HI> that we do; <HI>Sinful</HI> in all <HI>Under|takings;</HI> in all <HI>Conditions;</HI> in all <HI>Relati|ons;</HI> Defiled with <HI>Sin,</HI> in all that we meddle withal. In this our <HI>Sight</HI> of our <HI>Sin,</HI> tis not only our <HI>Actual Sin,</HI> that is to be &s;et before our Eyes. Our Sight mu&s;t penetrate as far as our <HI>O|riginal Sin.</HI> This mu&s;t be &s;een, as the <HI>Original</HI> of all our Sin. We mu&s;t Look <HI>in,</HI> Look <HI>down,</HI> upon that <HI>Foun|tain of Wickedne&s;s,</HI> which we have in an <HI>Heart,</HI> that is <HI>Deceitful above all things, and de&s;perately Wicked. 'O wretched One, that I am! What a Leper am I! What a Viper am I! What a Seed of all Sin have I Lodging in me!</HI></P>
<P>Secondly; Tis nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>Repen|tance,</HI> that we <HI>Know</HI> and <HI>Think,</HI> what we have <HI>done,</HI> when we have <HI>Sinn'd.</HI> The Voice of <HI>Repentance</HI> is that; Job 33.27. <HI>I have Sinned, and Perverted that which is Right, and it Profited me not.</HI> To <HI>make Light of Sin,</HI> this is incon&s;i&s;tent with <HI>Re|pentance.</HI> We don't <HI>Repent,</HI> until we
<PB N="9" REF="001462_0011_0FB34A58E5384648">
reckon <HI>Sin,</HI> the wor&s;t Evil in the world.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e I would Cha&s;ti&s;e the mo&s;t frequent and mo&s;t fatal <HI>Folly</HI> in the world, I will &s;omewhat Expre&s;&s;ively tell you, what a man <HI>does,</HI> when he <HI>Sins.</HI> My Hearers, Attend unto me!</P>
<P><HI>A Sinner</HI> does Deny, Di&s;own, ca&s;t off the <HI>Authority</HI> of the God that made him. He &s;ets up <HI>Him&s;elf</HI> in the Throne of his Maker.

He Que&s;tions the <HI>Goodne&s;s</HI> of GOD, and counts it better to be under his <HI>own Government,</HI> than that a <HI>Good</HI> GOD, &s;hould Govern him. He throws Contempt on the <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> of GOD, and repre&s;ents Him as an <HI>Unholy</HI> Approver of Sin. He defies the <HI>Power</HI> of GOD; &amp; Challenges all the Thun|derbolts of the All-powerful One. He de&s;pi&s;es the <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> of GOD; He de&s;pi&s;es the <HI>Threatenings</HI> of GOD; He believes not His <HI>Faithfulne&s;s</HI> in them. He makes a <HI>Vile U&s;e</HI> of the <HI>Benefits,</HI> he has received from GOD; a Vile U&s;e of the <HI>Corrections</HI> which GOD has Em|ploy'd upon him; a Vile U&s;e of the

<HI>Puni&s;hments</HI> which he hath &s;een GOD inflict upon other Offendors. He tramples on the <HI>Blood</HI> of the Ble&s;&s;ed JE|SUS, which hath been &s;hed, that men might be <HI>Redeemed from all Iniquity.</HI> He turns a Deaf Ear upon the motions of the Holy SPIRIT, who Cries unto him, O <HI>Do not this abominable thing!</HI> The Dictates and Warnings of his own <HI>Con|&s;cience,</HI> the Deputy of GOD, are nothing with him. The Excellent <HI>Pattern</HI> of a CHRIST, and of the <HI>Saints,</HI> the <HI>Excellent in the Earth,</HI> who have been the <HI>Follow|ers of that Good One,</HI> is derided by him. He di&s;turbs the &s;weet <HI>Harmony</HI> whereto the world is tuned, by a Great Creator and Pre&s;erver. He Obeys the <HI>Devil,</HI> he Follows the <HI>Devil;</HI> and makes him|&s;elf wor&s;e than the <HI>Bea&s;ts that Peri&s;h.</HI> He wrongs the <HI>Faculties</HI> of his own <HI>Soul;</HI> and Expo&s;es him&s;elf to <HI>Wounds</HI> from the Wrath of GOD upon <HI>All his Intere&s;ts.</HI> He prefers his <HI>Fle&s;h</HI> above his <HI>Immortal Spirit.</HI> He prefers <HI>Temporal</HI> Enjoy|ments on Earth, before <HI>Eternal</HI> Enjoy|ments in Heaven. He incurs the un|known, but fearful <HI>Mi&s;eries</HI> in the <HI>World to come;</HI> and all but for a momentany Delight in this World.</P>

<P>The <HI>Repenting Sinner,</HI> fir&s;t, flies to the <HI>Pardoning Mercy</HI> of God in our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. <HI>Repentance</HI> is accompanied with <HI>Hope;</HI> An <HI>Hope of Pardoning Mercy;</HI> and with an <HI>Hope|ful Prayer</HI> for a <HI>Pardon.</HI> An <HI>Hopele&s;s Re|pentance,</HI> is a <HI>Repentance</HI> for none but a <HI>Judas,</HI> none but a <HI>Devil.</HI> The <HI>Repent|ing</HI> Sinner, is not a <HI>De&s;pairing</HI> Sinner.

<P>Now, tis a Glorious CHRIST, who is his <HI>Hope.</HI> The <HI>Repenting Sinner</HI> flies to that <HI>Hope,</HI> as his only <HI>Refuge,</HI> 1 Joh. 1.7. <HI>The Blood of</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>the
