<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FROM the various conver&s;ations that we have had on the &s;ubject of taxation, and &s;till more from the ab&s;urd notions that many of your neighbours have entertained on this matter, in imagining that the income of their farms would &s;carcely be &s;ufficient to defray the certain annual demand to pay the prin|cipal and intere&s;t of the foreign foederal and internal debt, as well as the ab&s;olute and nece&s;&s;ary expence of government, I am in|duced to offer a Scheme whereby it will appear, that a &s;um far ex|ceeding whatever po&s;&s;ibly could be imagined would be required, might be rai&s;ed without oppre&s;&s;ing the inhabitants of Town or Country; and that too, in &s;o &s;imple and intelligible a manner, that every per&s;on, even of the meane&s;t capacity, may comprehend and dige&s;t the whole: but as the &s;um &s;pecified can never be wanted nor required by the State, one quarter part of this pro|po&s;ed

Whereof let us &s;uppo&s;e four thou&s;and two hundred in New-York, as they &s;tood computed in the year afore&s;aid, although greatly dimini&s;hed &s;ince; and tho&s;e taxed from ten<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That is to &s;ay on hou&s;es that rent from forty to two hundred pounds</NOTE> to fifty pounds each in proportion to the annual rent, cla&s;&s;ed in nine or ten different cla&s;&s;es, they would produce at a medium the annual revenue of</CELL>

<P>ON the contrary, as &s;oon as the internal and federal State debt was paid, the tax on hou&s;es in the Country, Towns and Cities, ought to be reduced in proportion to the terms &s;tated, and the wants of the State.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS AND REFLECTIONS ON THE FOREGOING PLAN OF TAXATION, HUMBLY SUBMITTED TO THE GOOD PEOPLE OF THIS STATE OF NEW-YORK.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;implicity of the Tax is perhaps one of the principal points of view in which it can be recommended to public notice: it cannot be difficult for the A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors appointed by government,
<PB N="14" REF="018436_0013_0FA76AE202C94990">or cho&s;e by the unanimous voice of the people, to arrange the in|habitants of each County, Di&s;trict, or Town, into the propo&s;ed or a greater number of cla&s;&s;es, without giving the lea&s;t di&s;gu&s;t or &s;howing any partiality in the manner; and when that is done, every member of the community will exactly know the <HI>quota</HI> a&s;&s;igned to him, and cheerfully &s;ubmit to &s;hare in the public burthen: whil&s;t it may prevent altercation in re&s;pect to one man's farm or e&s;tate being rated beyond what the due proportion will bear to another, the natural de&s;ire of being placed in a better light than perhaps a nice &s;crutiny into his &s;ituation would admit, will cau&s;e a laudable emulation of every hou&s;eholder to prefer a higher rather than a lower cla&s;s, and make every one plea&s;ed with that which may be allotted him.</P>
<P>IT is well known that the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable part of all taxes, is the anxious uncertainty in which it leaves the minds of the taxed; therefore it mu&s;t be a con&s;olation to every citizen, to know and be able to calculate for him&s;elf, the &s;um he owes to his country, as &s;oon as he is made acquainted with the general demand of the State, and that his &s;hare thereof will not depend on the erroneous judg|ment of an A&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. The burthen of &s;uch a tax, if it may be called by that name, becomes much lighter in con&s;equence of its &s;implicity, and every citizen of the State may be truly &s;aid to be his own A&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; an advantage hitherto unknown to be enjoyed either in Europe or America.</P>
<P>THE unity and ea&s;e of collecting the tax is &s;o obvious, that a preference mu&s;t be given to it in oppo&s;ition to the intricate and uncertain methods practi&s;ed in a neighbouring State, as well as in Europe: It is required only to know the propo&s;ed medium in order
<PB N="15" REF="018436_0014_0FA76AE62CEFCCA8">to a&s;&s;ign the lowe&s;t and highe&s;t tax, and proportion with mathe|matical exactne&s;s, the &s;um that each intermediate cla&s;s mu&s;t pay: and what enhances the value of the mode is, that the tax may be rai&s;ed or dimini&s;hed without trouble, without alteration in the fun|damental principle, and without an addition to the number of officers or collectors appointed to receive the &s;ame.</P>
<P>THIS mode of taxation will unite the greate&s;t and mo&s;t valuable advantages; a preci&s;e and impartial equity in its di&s;tribution; an incon&s;iderable weight on each individual founded on that very pre|ci&s;ion; and it will convey to each ma&s;ter of a hou&s;e the clear know|ledge of what he has to pay: this mo&s;t u&s;eful knowledge will con|&s;equently bani&s;h from his mind all dread, and in &s;hort become to the mo&s;t uninformed citizen, a &s;ource of perpetual tranquility and peace of mind on that delicate head. If then this tax in all its va|riations, can be le&s;&s;ened or rai&s;ed without its being &s;carcely felt, and with an expence &s;o trifling and well a&s;certained; it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that tho&s;e advantages will undoubtedly be derived from the unity in the plan, as well as from the extreme &s;implicity in the execution.</P>
<P>THE burthen chiefly, it may be &s;aid, will fall on the middle cla&s;&s;es of the people; but who more able to bear it? Will they re|pine at the &s;mall &s;um allotted in the &s;pecimen to each man's &s;hare, when they perceive that the very poor indeed pay &s;uch a trifle? Surely no?</P>
<P>THE riche&s;t citizen of New-York, will only have to contribute &s;ixteen pounds per annum, for his hou&s;e and equivalent tax, whil&s;t a per&s;on inhabiting a hou&s;e of forty pounds yearly rent, pays two
<PB N="16" REF="018436_0015_0FA76AE7337A3130">pounds eleven &s;hillings and nine-pence, a gentleman of the large&s;t landed e&s;tate in the country, nine pounds fifteen &s;hillings, and the poore&s;t hou&s;eholder no more than &s;ix &s;hillings and nine-pence, as has been fully &s;hewn; the principal per&s;on in Albany, and the various Towns throughout the State, &s;ix pounds, and the poore&s;t mechanic in them, eleven &s;hillings and nine-pence only.</P>
<P>WHO can therefore complain of the burthen or heavy load of taxes, when it is con&s;idered that the duties which might be laid on wines and other luxuries, would amount, on the con&s;umption of the rich, to perhaps as much as he is taxed on the whole?</P>
<P>AS it has been before ob&s;erved, that the chief burthen might be thought to fall on the middle cla&s;&s;es of the people, it becomes ne|ce&s;&s;ary to remark, that the middle cla&s;&s;es are by far the mo&s;t nume|rous, the mo&s;t-thriving, and tho&s;e on who&s;e labour principally de|pends the &s;trength, the aggrandizement, and in &s;hort the popula|tion of the State: far happier in that as well as in many other in|&s;tances are we than the Europeans, who&s;e government hardly ad|mits but of two extremes, and know not that re&s;pectable cla&s;s we here denominate middling! That cla&s;s of true American freehol|ders, equally removed from the danger of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing riches and the meane&s;s of poverty; who, independent and free, till the &s;oil which belongs to them, embelli&s;h the earth, convert the hideous &s;wamp into plea&s;ing meadows; and in the purity of their manners as well as in their unbia&s;&s;ed, unprejudiced turn of mind, become and are in fact the nur&s;ery of our mo&s;t valuable cla&s;s of citizens indu&s;trious and neat at home, brave in the field, &s;agacious and
<PB N="17" REF="018436_0016_0FA76AE74EBE6618">proper to fill the different municipal &s;tations of government which may be confered on them.</P>
<P>WE have only to add that the expence of collecting the pro|po&s;ed tax, is trifling in compari&s;on to any other mode that can be devi&s;ed: For let us &s;uppo&s;e that the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors would chearfully un|dertake to make the arrangement without fee or reward, will not any man be glad to collect, in his particular town or di&s;|trict, the whole tax for two and a half per cent. on the whole amount? Which of cour&s;e would bring in &s;o much clear money to government, free from every other charge.</P>
<P>SINCE therefore it is evident that a &s;ufficiency for the exigencies of the State may in this manner be rai&s;ed without taxing the land; will it not be of infinite &s;ervice to the community in general to adopt the plan? Will it not be the means of drawing from all parts of Europe the mo&s;t valuable &s;ubjects and citizens for an infant State, men of indu&s;try, acquainted with agriculture and the arts, and who, having groaned under oppre&s;&s;ion in their own country, would ta&s;te in a &s;uperior degree the &s;weets of liberty in this? And who, from a de&s;ire to obtain the luxuries as well as the nece&s;&s;aries of life, would be pre&s;&s;ed on, by natural impul&s;e, to the utmo&s;t exertions of &s;kill in their various profe&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>WILL not the lands within this State being excu&s;ed from paying any tax, prove equal, if not &s;uperior to a bounty granted on the exportation of grain, which in another country has produced &s;o wonderful an effect? And in a State occupied chiefly by farmers or improvers of the land, would put it on a much more excellent footing than its neighbours; and enable the merchant to export
<PB N="18" REF="018436_0017_0FA76AE803361908">the produce on &s;uch rea&s;onable terms as might greatly affect the imports both in price and quantity, to the no &s;mall emolument and advantage of every individual of the community.</P>
<P>LET us on the other hand con&s;ider the high and di&s;tingui&s;hed character which this State will thereby obtain among the nations in Europe, or wherever it &s;hall be known throughout the world, that the arable, woodland and meadows, are exempt from taxes; that the manufactures and various productions of the univer&s;e may be admitted into it, without payment of any duties; and that the in|habitants liberally provide for their own internal demands without burthening the foreigner. What idea then mu&s;t foreigners con|ceive of &s;uch a country, where be&s;ides all tho&s;e advantages, they are protected both in their civil and religious rights? We are lo&s;t in contemplation, and ready, to declare, that no one who is unac|quainted with freedom, and that liberality of mind which naturally accompanies it, can conceive or under&s;tand &s;o excellent a con&s;ti|tution!</P>
<P>ANOTHER very important matter for the con&s;ideration of the good people of this State is, that were the mode of taxation, here propo&s;ed, to take place, the value of land throughout the whole, would certainly increa&s;e, and be enhanced by the free enjoyment of it, without burthen or load on the cultivator; whil&s;t at the &s;ame time the tax it&s;elf would mo&s;t certainly gradually dimini&s;h, ac|cording to the number of hou&s;es that might be erected and rai&s;ed by the new comers, as well as the former po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors; who&s;e pro|geny, being chiefly brought up in the &s;ame line and manner of life, would require of cour&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">arate habitations as they grew up: far from repining at &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> tax, the farmer will on the con|trary
<PB N="19" REF="018436_0018_0FA76AE8C60E2BC0">rejoice in the con&s;ideration that if his dwelling pays &s;o much a year towards the &s;upport of a ju&s;t and mild government, that very hou&s;e is his ca&s;tle, the &s;acred a&s;ylum wherein re&s;ides his family, unexpo&s;ed to the prying eye of an Exci&s;eman, and freed from all obtru&s;ion incon&s;i&s;tent with civil liberty; that the produce of his fields may circulate free from all impo&s;ts until &s;hipped for foreign markets, and that his lands, va&s;t and fertile as they may be, will owe nothing to any Potentate, King, or Lord on earth, &s;ave only gratitude to the Lord God of all lands.</P>
<P>IT is well known by tho&s;e who have travelled in Europe, that it is not &s;o much the real burthen of the tax which oppre&s;&s;es, as the mode of collecting it, the amazing expence attending the collection, and the particular objects on which taxes are laid: the&s;e are the great evils which kill young indu&s;try, bring on de&s;pair and di&s;couragement, open wide the pernicious door of contraband, which leads to an infinity of fal&s;e oaths and frauds an evil which finally ruins the morals of the people.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, this &s;imple tax leaving every effort of the human genius uncontrouled and free, (an object of the utmo&s;t import|ance in this young country) damping no &s;chemes whatever, either rural or commercial, but offering to man's indu&s;try an unre&s;trained career, could be truly &s;aid to operate as no taxes ever operated be|fore, and that it would abundantly enable government to act with becoming dignity, without exhau&s;ting any of the vital juices of &s;o|ciety, impeding any branch of commerce, or di&s;couraging any advantageous &s;cheme whatever.</P>
<P>IN the City, the inhabitants whether Merchants or Mechanics <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">, no matter what goods I import, what channel of trade
<PB N="20" REF="018436_0019_0FA76AE98DA539A0">I pur&s;ue; no matter what is my craft, or the indu&s;try of my hands, I may trade on and work, find out new openings in commerce, invent new powers in mechani&s;m; Government like an indulgent parent, will not lay a burthen on this or that article, this or that branch of indu&s;try; it will not e&s;tabli&s;h monopolies which enrich &s;ome, whil&s;t they condemn others to dearth and penury: my hands, my genius, my faculties, my experience, all, all is free.</P>
<P>WHILST ploughing his furrow, the hone&s;t hu&s;bandman will &s;ay, prai&s;e and long duration to that government which marks my dwelling place only, for a ju&s;t, equal, and unavoidable tax, and leaves at the &s;ame time my lands, my meadows, my cattle, my crops, unincumbered and free: ought not I to purcha&s;e by &s;ome con&s;ideration the undi&s;turbed &s;weet repo&s;e which this very hou&s;e affords me and mine! It has been the place of my nativity, the &s;ub&s;tantial and neat &s;helter which my father erected again&s;t the &s;e|verities of winter, and the &s;corching heats of the &s;ummer; it is the roof under which dwells all that is dear to me; it is that which gives me a rank among&s;t men, and makes me to be called an in|habitant of &s;uch a di&s;trict: ble&s;&s;ed be that mode of taxation, which in&s;ures us a new branch of civil happine&s;s! Since it produces the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies; &s;ince it is either le&s;&s;ened or rai&s;ed by the &s;ingle &s;troke of a pen; &s;ince every citizen pays but in a due proportion to what he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es; &s;ince no part of it goes to feed rich and un|feeling Financiers, and a numerous train of Officers, who in &s;o many parts of the world con&s;ume a quarter part of the taxes rai&s;ed, and fatten with impunity on the very blood of the people.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="018436_0020_0FA76AEA45E15348">
IF then the Merchant, the Mechanic, the Artificer, the Farmer find in this mode of taxation nothing which can require any extra|ordinary exertions of indu&s;try to pay the &s;um demanded, there will be no dread or apprehen&s;ion of the hour of a&s;&s;e&s;sment, nor in that of the collection.</P>
<P>AND &s;ince the different cla&s;&s;es in which the citizens of this State may be divided, can equally partake of the obvious advantages here propo&s;ed, re&s;ulting from this new mode of taxation, as well from the &s;implicity of its execution, as the preci&s;ion of its di&s;tribu|tion, let not the novelty of the &s;cheme create prejudice or pre|vent its being adopted; for although &s;uch be the unhappy effects of the fir&s;t appearance of things altogether new and &s;triking, yet the many and great good con&s;equences ari&s;ing, it is to be hoped, will bani&s;h from the mind every pre-conceived opinion on the &s;ub|ject, and procure the attentively reading as well as maturely weighing &s;o important a matter before the good people of this State gives it a negative: let not the plan be di&s;regarded and looked on as chimerical, or romantic, before their minds have given it that due &s;hare of attention and &s;erious con&s;ideration, which &s;o intere&s;ting a &s;ubject requires: let it be &s;aid for the fir&s;t time, and perhaps the only in&s;tance in the world, that in this State of New-York, we have LANDS WITHOUT TAXES, AND CITIES WITHOUT CUSTOM-HOUSES.</P>
<P>WHAT a train of complicated and perhaps envious thoughts will not this &s;hort phra&s;e rai&s;e, not only in the minds of our neighbours but even in that of the Europeans who are attentively attending to our new polity: this is the important moment, when our Le|gi&s;lators, the new Fathers of this new State, mu&s;t in all the extent

<P>LET then the City Merchant, the Mechanic, and the hone&s;t Hu&s;bandman, &s;eriou&s;ly revolve in his mind the different ob&s;erva|tions herein contained: if the pomp of eloquence and the beauties of &s;tile be bani&s;hed from this &s;mall pamphlet, it is becau&s;e the few &s;imple truths on which the &s;cheme is built, and here propo&s;ed for the in&s;pection of the Public, &s;hould, in being le&s;s adorned, become more &s;triking and convincing.</P>
