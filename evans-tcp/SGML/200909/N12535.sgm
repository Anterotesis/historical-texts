<HEAD>A &s;erious ADDRESS to the People called QUAKERS, on the Continent of <HI>North-America,</HI> relative to the late great Revolution.</HEAD>
<P>AS there are divers opinions in the Society, re&s;pecting the pre&s;ont Government, and doubts in the minds of &s;ome, whether it be right or proper to withdraw their obedience from preceding rulers and powers, and to &s;ubmit to rulers and powers, who are &s;eparated from, and &s;et up in the &s;tead and without the con&s;ent of, the former: The right under&s;tanding and &s;ettling of this point appears to be the fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary con&s;ideration. I would therefore, in the fir&s;t place, ob&s;erve and lay it down as an axiom, that, in ca&s;es of &s;uch maguitude as the pre&s;ent, there mu&s;t certainly be &s;omething more than human, and that God Al|mighty, the Supreme Governor of the Univer&s;e, who is no re|&s;pecter of per&s;ons, who doeth what&s;oever he plea&s;eth with the powers of this world, &s;etteth up and pulleth down whom&s;oever he plea&s;eth, and, for cau&s;es be&s;t known unto him&s;elf, hath allow|ed and permitted, and &s;till doth allow and permit, changes and alterations in and of &s;tates and empires, to take place. It may not be ami&s;s to call to mind the va|tious mighty and well-known re|volutions that he hath permitted at different times, not only a|mong&s;t the people of Great Bri|tain, but mo&s;t if not all the em|pires and people upon the face of the earth, to the &s;ubduing and &s;etting a&s;ide one, and rai&s;ing up another in the room thereof, from the times of Saul and David down to this very day; &s;ome of which, for the &s;ake of the doubting, un|informed, or incon&s;iderate, I &s;hall remark, as conci&s;ely as conveni|ently may be.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Saul, which was the fir&s;t we read of in Holy Writ, although regularly and &s;o|lemnly e&s;tabli&s;hed, yet by degrees was weakened and reduced, and that of David by degrees rai&s;ed over it; the introduction and ri&s;e of who&s;e government we may &s;ee 1 Sam. 22, where we find that, on account of Saul's tyranny, David fled <Q>and e&s;caped to the cave of Adullam, and when his brethren, and all his fa|ther's hou&s;e heard it, they went down thither to him, and every one that was in di&s;tre&s;s, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was di&s;con|tented, and gathered them|&s;elves unto him, and he be|came a Captain over them:</Q> This was the beginning of Da|vid's power, and the&s;e men, we learn, continued together with David until he was made King in Saul's &s;tead, which, though by the order and appointment of Providence, yet it may be ob|&s;erved that it was contrary to na|ture, as well as to the u&s;ual cu&s;|toms of all ages, &s;ince David not being heir to the crown, the claim thereto upon tho&s;e principles be|longing to the hou&s;e of Saul, which I think, was notwith&s;tand|ing declared &s;hould grow weaker and weaker, and that of David &s;tronger and &s;tronger.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="015843_0003_0F9A2C91522E05B0">
And of Solomon, (David's &s;on and immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;or) the Lord declared, <Q>Fora&s;much as thou ha&s;t nor kept my covenant and my &s;tatutes which I have com|manded thee, I will &s;urely <HI>rend</HI> the kingdom from thee, and will give it <HI>to thy &s;ervant.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding in thy days, I will not do it, (for David thy father's &s;ake) but I will <HI>rend</HI> it out of the hand of thy &s;on. Howbeit I will not <HI>rend</HI> away all the kingdom, but will give one tribe to thy &s;on, (for Da|vid my &s;ervant's &s;ake, and for Jeru&s;alem's &s;ake, which I have cho&s;en.</Q>) And in the next ver&s;e it is expre&s;sly declared, that <Q><HI>The Lord &s;tirred up</HI> an adver&s;ary unto Solomon, Hadad the E|domite.</Q>&mdash;And in the 23<ABBR>d</ABBR> ver&s;e it is again &s;aid, that <Q><HI>God &s;tirred him up</HI> another adver&s;a|ry, Rezon the &s;on of Eliadah.</Q> Which pa&s;&s;iges clearly manife&s;t, that the hand of the Lord is in &s;uch events, and particularly the fulfilling of the foregoing pre|diction, which we find con&s;umed by the declaration of the Prophet to Jeroboam, as al&s;o by the exem|plification of the rent garment; the Prophet telling him in the name of the Lord, "I will take thee, and thou &s;halt reign accord|ing so all that thy &s;oul de&s;ireth, and &s;halt be King over I&s;rael," ver. 37.&mdash;which accordingly came to pa&s;s by the revolt of the ten tribes, as we may &s;ee in the 12th chap. upon the unju&s;t, ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;h and in&s;olent an&s;wer, which Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">oboam gave to the petitions of the peo|ple.</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance of the deal|ings of the Lord with the king|doms of men, we may &s;ee in the 16th chap, of I. Kings, where "the word of the Lord came to Jehu, the &s;on of Hanani, again&s;t Baa&s;ha, (King of I&s;rael) &s;aying, fora&s;much as I exalted thee out of the du&s;t, and made thee Prince over my people I&s;rael, and thou ha&s;t walked in the way of Jero|boam; behold, I will take away the POSTERITY of Baa&s;ha, and the POSTERITY of his hou&s;e."&mdash; And in the 9th of II. Kings, we find that the Prophet Eli&s;ha fore|told the reign of Jehu, the &s;on of Jeho&s;haphat, (though a &s;ervant) in preference to his ma&s;ter, who had 70 &s;ons, &s;aying unto Jehu, by a me&s;&s;enger which he &s;ent for that purpo&s;e, <Q>Thus faith the Lord God of I&s;rael, I have anointed thee King over the people of the Lord, even over I&s;rael, and thou &s;halt &s;mite the hou&s;e of Ahab thy ma&s;ter,</Q>&mdash;which was accordingly fulfilled, notwith|&s;tanding the contemptuous &s;peech of the impudent woman Jezebel, who, upon his entering the city of Jezteel, cried out, <Q>Had Zimri peace, who flew his ma&s;ter?</Q>&mdash;but &s;he lived not long to repeat her folly:&mdash;Of this Jehu, although he flew his ma&s;ter and his 70 &s;ons, by orders for that purpo&s;e, yet, according to the 30th ver. of 10th chap. the Lord &s;aid unto him, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t done my will in exe|cuting that which is right in my eyes, and ha&s;t done unto the hou&s;e of Ahab, according to all that was commanded thee, thy children of the fourth generation &s;hall &s;it on the throne of I&s;rael.</P>

<PB N="4" REF="015843_0005_0F9A2C92D1F26028">rai&s;ing up the latter;</Q>&mdash;and a little further, &s;peaking of the form of government, &s;ays,&mdash; <Q>Was not I&s;rael governed &s;ome|time by Judges, &s;ometime by Elders, and &s;ometime by Kings? and while they &s;tood in the coun&s;el of the Lord, the peo|ple hearkened to them, was not the Lord among them, and &s;ometimes rai&s;ed up <HI>unlikely means,</HI> as David a &s;hepherd's boy, and Gideon a thre&s;her, and he was made a Judge and a Redeemer of I&s;rael out of their &s;lavery.</Q>&mdash;By which ob|&s;ervations it appears, that Francis Howgill was a &s;trong friend to public ju&s;tice, and that he did not apprehend an attachment to any particular form of govern|ment merely as &s;uch, by any means e&s;&s;ential or indi&s;pen&s;ible. &mdash;The &s;ame author, page 320, further &s;aith,&mdash; <Q>Now many are &s;o doting on the name of a parliament, as though it were e&s;&s;ential, or the name to be the foundation of government, and cry up the privilege of parliament, as &s;ome have done prerogative, and would fight about a name in their heat and pa&s;&s;ion, and lo&s;e the thing in|tended, though they be the repre&s;entative of the people, to do good to the people, and not hurt, they are accounted as good &s;ervants to God, and to them that elected them; but if they would, &s;o &s;oon as got together, &s;et up a particular intere&s;t to the <HI>imbondaging</HI> of the whole," (as the parliament of Great-Britain towards this country <HI>"in all ca&s;es what&s;oever"</HI>) and then cry up their privilege to do what they li&s;t; <HI>then it is no rebellion in God's account,</HI> neither in the account of ju&s;t men to call them away, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">a they do not perform the thing intended, and will not hearken to the cry of their ma&s;ters (the people) but perhaps call them <HI>rebels and traitors,</HI> if they &s;hould be turned out.</Q>&mdash;And page 329 of the &s;ame work, &s;peak|ing of the conduct of the parlia|ment, with regard to their ob|&s;truction of the liberties of the people, he &s;aith, <Q>Therefore <HI>the army</HI> in putting a &s;top to that which did retard and draw back from the end afore&s;aid, in God's &s;ight and in the &s;ight of illuminated men, is <HI>no re|bellion, no treachery.</HI></Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>The numerous changes and revolutions in the kingdoms and empires of the earth, clearly de|&s;cribed and foretold by the Pro|phets <HI>I&s;aiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Amos</HI> and <HI>Zephaniah,</HI> particularly concerning the <HI>Phi|li&s;tines, Ammonites, Edomites, Mo|abites, Dama&s;cus, Babylon, Jeru|&s;alem, Tyre, Sydon, Media, Per|&s;ia, Graecia, A&s;&s;yria, Ethiopia,</HI> &amp;c. as may be &s;een in holy writ, and which, for brevity &s;ake, are not now repeated, fully prove the truth of the axiom laid down in the beginning; and though that mode of communicating to man|kind the will and purpo&s;es of God concerning the powers of this world, may be now almo&s;t cea&s;ed or at lea&s;t &s;u&s;pended, yet the Creator of Heaven and Earth, who &s;eeth from everla&s;ting to e|verla&s;ting, no doubt takes the &s;ame cognizance, and exerci&s;es the &s;ame &s;uperintending and exe|cutive power he did in days of old.</P>

<P>Before I leave this part of the &s;ubject, it may not be ami&s;s to in&s;ert &s;ome further ob&s;ervations of E. Burrough before mentioned, in an&s;wer to &s;ome queries propo|&s;ed to the people called Quakers, by one of King Charles's friends, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the Earl of Clarendon; to which Edw. Bur|rough replied thus, <Q>Yet not|with&s;tanding mu&s;t &s;till &s;ay, and it is my judgment, that there was very great oppre&s;&s;ion and vexation under the go|vernment of the late King, and Bi&s;hops under his power, which the Lord was offended with, and many good people op|pre&s;&s;ed by; for which cau&s;e, the Lord might and <HI>did ju&s;tly rai&s;e up &s;ome to oppo&s;e,</HI> and &s;trive again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ions and inju&s;tice, and to pre&s;s after reformation in all things. This principle of &s;incerity, which in &s;ome things carried them on <HI>in oppo&s;ing</HI> oppre&s;&s;ions, and pre&s;s|ing after reformation, <HI>I can never deny,</HI> but acknowledge it.</Q>&mdash;See Sew<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll's hi&s;t. p. 283.</P>
<P>The foregoing precedents and ob&s;ervations one would think might be &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy the doubting, that the pre&s;ent revo|lution is the work of the Lord, and according to the plan and de&s;ign of his providence, and tend to <HI>prove</HI> the &s;afety and pro|priety of a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the pow|ers which now rule: But it may be objected in ju&s;tification of the pre&s;ent &s;cruples and refu&s;al by &s;ome, that the pre&s;ent powers and government are u&s;urped and con|trary to law: To this it may be an&s;wered, that the &s;ame objection would have held good under eve|ry revolution which has hereto|fore been brought about, as they mu&s;t no doubt have been contra|ry to the authority of the pre|ceding powers, and by their friends and adherents been deemed u&s;urpations, which might al&s;o have been alledged again&s;t the pre&s;ent con&s;titution of Great|Britain, as may be hereafter re|marked.</P>

<P>It is here remarkable that our Saviour appears to have revolved in his mind the whole nature of the ca&s;e, and of the demand that was made; for upon Peter's in|forming the Tax-gatherers, that his ma&s;ter paid Tribute, our Lord took occa&s;ion to remind him by a gentle rep ehen&s;ion, that he had gone further in his reply than he was bound to do, or than was re|qui&s;ite from the nature of their condition and circum&s;tances; and immediately upon Peter's enter|ing the hou&s;e, prevented his &s;peaking by making u&s;e of a very &s;trong and lively argument to convince Peter, that he had been quite as quick as was nece&s;&s;ary; and that in&s;tead of being bound to pay the Tax, they were, ac|cording to the cu&s;tom of the country, exempt and free; yet notwith&s;tanding this freedom and privilege, or without the lea&s;t objection to the u&s;e to which the money might be applied, though the Romans were in general Hea|then idolaters, and about that time, as appears from hi&s;tory, actually engaged in war on &s;eve|ral &s;ides, and the character of their Emperor <HI>Tiberius</HI> marked as debauched, unju&s;t, cruel, tyran|nic, &s;anguinary and inhuman.&mdash; Yet Chri&s;t our Lord, tho' cloath|ed with maje&s;ty and power above all the laws and powers of this world, and was thereby able to have &s;ubdued all things unto him&s;elf, and made them &s;ub&s;er|vient to his will, was &s;o tender of giving unea&s;ine&s;s to the powers that then bore rule, that he or|dered Peter, by producing an a|&s;toni&s;hing miracle, as we have read, to comply and pay the Tax for this very &s;triking rea&s;on, "<HI>let we &s;hould offend."</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thomas Story</HI> before mentioned, in his journal, page 413 &s;aith, <Q>That the &s;ufferings of the faithful in Chri&s;t, <HI>in all ages,</HI> have not aro&s;e from the breach <HI>of any laws</HI> relating only <HI>to ci|vil</HI> government, which they do readily ob&s;erve and con&s;cien|tiou&s;ly obey.</Q>&mdash;And in the &s;ame page, adds, <Q>That as there always is and mu&s;t be, in the nature of things, a great and nece&s;&s;ary charge attending go|vernment, (a kingdom <HI>or &s;tate</HI> being but as one great hou&s;e or family, and no private or par|ticular family c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n &s;ub&s;i&s;t with|out charge) for that cau&s;e, all are to pay Tribute, as ju&s;tly (or equally) impo&s;ed by the legi&s;lature.</Q></P>

<P><HI>Samuel Bownas,</HI> in the account of his life, relates an epi&s;tolary argument he had with one <HI>Ray,</HI> a Prie&s;t, who charged friends with an incon&s;i&s;tency in that, while they actually paid and even collected Tax for the purpo&s;es of carrying on a war again&s;t France with vigour: They yet refu&s;ed to pay Tythes and Militia-a&s;&s;e&s;s|ments.&mdash; To which S. Bownas re|plies, <Q>We are &s;till of the &s;ame mind with R.

<P>From what has been ob&s;erved, I think it may plainly appear that friends heretofore have been &s;o far from cen&s;uring or condemn|ing their members on &s;uch occa|&s;tions,
<PB N="15" REF="015843_0016_0F9A2C9BD0AECC38">that they have rather en|couraged the Payment of Taxes, (except tho&s;e in lieu of per&s;onal &s;ervice) and advi&s;ed a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the powers that bore rule, un|der the various governments and revolutions in which they lived; but if this be doubted, or any thing has been advanced that is not conformable to the truth, it will be well for any one to point out the &s;ame; but if they are con&s;i&s;tent with rea&s;on, ju&s;tice and truth, it will be well to be cau|tious how any thing is acted op|po&s;ite thereto; and whil&s;t we de|clare that we cannot have a hand in public revolutions, (as belong|ing unto God) by promoting and encouraging, we may beware of taking an active part by oppo&s;ing and di&s;couraging, whether as to Non-payment of Taxes, or other civil acts; and then of con&s;e|quence, none can, with propriety or con&s;i&s;tency, be cen&s;ured or condemned concerning the &s;ame, e&s;pecially in ca&s;es where no pre|cedent for cen&s;ure or condemna|tion can be found in the hi&s;tory or proceedings of friends.</P>
<P>As it is queried by &s;ome, whe|ther Friends paid their Taxes un|der the government of <HI>Oliver Cromwell,</HI> although there is as great or greater rea&s;on to con|clude they did, than there is to &s;uppo&s;e or prove that they did not; yet it may be ob&s;erved that the practice of friends, ever &s;ince the time of Geo. Fox, has been to keep a particular account of the &s;ufferings they &s;u&s;tained, and the amount thereof, when it was on a con&s;cientious or religious account, which have been record|ed, and tran&s;mitted down to as from time to time: Now as it never yet has appeared in the ac|counts of friends &s;ufferings, that any thing was taken from them, on account of Taxes, even under <HI>Cromwell's</HI> government, the com|mittee of &s;afety, or any of the then powers, which, if on a reli|gious account, they had refu&s;ed to pay, would have amounted to a very con&s;iderable &s;um, equal if not &s;uperior to any re|corded by them, and would no doubt have been taken particular notice of among&s;t their other &s;uf|ferings; but as nothing of this kind appears, it is therefore <HI>more than probable,</HI> and may be very &s;afely concluded, that they &s;ub|mitted in the&s;e re&s;pects to the &s;e|veral governments, of what kind &s;oever, under which they lived; and that they paid their Taxes for the &s;upport of tho&s;e govern|ments, in common with other men, according to their uniform practice as a people.</P>
<P>To the above Te&s;timony of the dead, let us attend al&s;o to one of the living, an anonymus author; though well known to be Timo|thy Davis; a worthy friend and mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel; in a letter to &s;ome of his intimate friends on the &s;ubject of paying Taxes to the pre&s;ent government, printed at Watertown about two years ago, and &s;old by B. Edes, near the Bridge, has fully declared his &s;entiments in the following man|ner:</P>
<P>"If it be &s;afe to follow the ex|ample of our predece&s;&s;ors, why not comply.&mdash;"What did they do?"&mdash;I an&s;wer, they have from their very fir&s;t appearance, as a &s;eparate &s;ociety, been &s;ubject to &s;uch who were inve&s;ted with the authority of the nation, without meddling with the various di&s;|putes that have ari&s;en &s;ince their
<PB N="16" REF="015843_0017_0F9A2C9C8FD8C728">time, concerning regal authority, and on whom it ought to devolve. For a farther con&s;ideration hereof, you may remember, that Friends made their appearance in the reign of King Charles the Fir&s;t; who by his too much a&s;piring af|ter &s;overeignty or de&s;poti&s;m, a|larmed the people; who, headed by Oliver Cromwell, prevailed again&s;t the king, and took the reigns of government into his own hands, and governed the kingdom him&s;elf, under the cha|racter of lord protector.&mdash;</P>
<P>Here we do not find but that Friends, who had paid their alle|giance and their taxes to the king, continued to pay them to Oliver Cromwell, during the time he held the reins of government: And what can be &s;aid of him, but that he headed the populace, and was an oppo&s;er of kingly autho|rity, not merely as &s;uch, but as it became, through the hands of the king, &s;ubver&s;ive of the rights and priviledges of the people: What harder things can be &s;aid of tho&s;e who are at the head of the pre&s;ent oppo&s;ition, that may render them le&s;s worthy of recei|ving taxes to defray the charges of government. By all that I have been able to di&s;cover, our &s;ociety in England have ever made a point of being careful and exact in paying all taxes that are legally a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, except the Prie&s;ts rates.</P>
<P>After CROMWELL, king Charles the &s;econd came to the throne, and they paid taxes to him al&s;o. After which, the crown continued in the family of Stew|arts, until the di&s;turbances in king James the &s;econd's reign; who, by his favouring popery, ju&s;tly alarmed and incens'd the people again&s;t him, that thinking him&s;elf not &s;afe among a ju&s;tly provoked people, took &s;helter in France, which made way for the Prince of Orange. Here we find the line of Stewarts interrupted again, which devolved on them according to legal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and the Prince, in conjunction with the people, oppo&s;ing the then kingly government in James; much the &s;ame as is laid to the charge of tho&s;e who are at the head of the pre&s;ent oppo&s;ition; and Friends who were de&s;irous to live in peace with all men, paid taxes to him likewi&s;e; but &s;ay they&mdash;"James favoured popery and endeavoured to introduce po|pi&s;h government, and therefore forfeited his right to the crown." Be it &s;o&mdash;but is favouring popery the only in&s;tance in which the kings of England can forfeit their rights to reign over a free peo|ple?"&mdash;I &s;hould think, that when the &s;word is put into the hands of a king, to be directed <HI>for the puni&s;hment of evil doers, and prai&s;e to them that do well,</HI> we might have &s;ome rea&s;on to expect him to act, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, an|&s;werable to his exalted &s;tation, and the tru&s;t the people have re|po&s;ed in him, (askingly authority originates from the people)&mdash;But if to the contrary he &s;hould act &s;o far below his exalted &s;tation as to turn the point of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e &s;word at the vitals of the people, it mu&s;t be very alarming, e&s;pecially when they have confer'd all the favours upon him, that were in their power, con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;afety of the kingdom, he as fully for|feits his right to reign over them, as in the ca&s;e of popery.</P>
<P>Every con&s;iderate man, no doubt, would be glad of &s;uch a
<PB N="17" REF="015843_0018_0F9A2C9D4FD3C200">form of government as might be unexceptionable; but we have no rea&s;on to expect it, in this imper|fect &s;tate of things: Yet we ought to u&s;e all ju&s;t and rea&s;onable means to rectify all di&s;orders in government, that are in the com|pa&s;s of our power, con&s;i&s;tent with the peaceable profe&s;&s;ion we make; and at the &s;ame time, to be as careful not to complain without ju&s;t cau&s;e, but be as content as we can, under &s;uch a form of government, as it hath plea&s;ed Divine Providence to ca&s;t our lots: And it mu&s;t be a very bad one indeed, that is not preferable to a &s;tate of anarchy. In a word, let a man be under any form of government he can imagine to him&s;elf, where he receives any advantage by it, and while he remains under it, he ought to bear his proportion of the charge of it; for the thoughts of having our lives and every thing that is near and dear to us, lie wholly at the mercy of every invader, with|out any po&s;&s;ibility of redre&s;s from any legal authority, I &s;hould think would incline us to be wil|ling to bear our ju&s;t proportion of the charge of &s;uch government as we are under, if it &s;hould not in every re&s;pect be con&s;i&s;tent with the mo&s;t perfect &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>Our Saviour hath &s;et this mat|ter in an indi&s;putable light to me, by the conver&s;ation he had with Peter on that &s;ubject, at a time when tho&s;e who received tribute|money came to Peter querying with him, whether their <HI>Ma&s;ter paid Tribute</HI> or not, <HI>Peter &s;aid</HI> he did. Chri&s;t willing, it appears, to take advantage of this oppor|tunity to leave an example to fu|ture ages of his approbation of paying taxes, in a ca&s;e &s;imilar to the pre&s;ent, in every thing e&s;&s;en|tial to the pre&s;ent argument, and as an additional weight to the holy example, introduc'd a con|ver&s;ation with Peter, not waiting for him to introduce it, or pro|pound any que&s;tions on the &s;ub|ject, but <HI>prevented him,</HI> as if with de&s;ign to remove every he&s;itation, proceeded thus, <HI>What thinke&s;t thou Simon, of whom do the kings of earth take cu&s;tom or tribute, of their own children or of &s;trangers? Peter &s;aith unto him, of &s;trangers. Je&s;us &s;aith unto him, Then are the children free.</HI> As much as if he had &s;aid, "then have they no ju&s;t demand on us, we being children, may very well refu&s;e paying of it.&mdash;Neverthele&s;s, lea&s;t we &s;hould offend them, it is be&s;t it &s;hould be paid, therefore I would have thee do it," which he was enabled to do by an extraor|dinary miracle. I cannot &s;ee how it is po&s;&s;ible for any thing to be expre&s;s'd more clearly to remove every &s;cruple. It is further ob|&s;ervable, that there is not one word of objection either from Chri&s;t or Peter, that part of this tribute money went to defray mi|litary charges, (for it undoubted|ly did) which we might expect to find here if any where, &s;eeing they were then upon the point of paying taxes.</P>
<P>If our rulers pur&s;ue mea&s;ures for the defence and &s;upport of civil government, that we think not &s;trictly con&s;i&s;tent with the rules of the go&s;pel, even by re|pelling force by force, to the &s;hed|ding of human blood, it is out of our power to help it; they pro|ceed in the defence of govern|ment as it &s;uits them be&s;t; and if their manner doth not &s;uit us, that may not hinder, but we may
<PB N="18" REF="015843_0019_0F9A2C9E842C6F88">receive as much advantage from it as if they pur&s;ued &s;uch mea|&s;ures as we may think we could point out. However, let them proceed in a ho&s;tile manner or not, in the defence of our rights and privileges, it is certain, if we receive advantage from civil government, we ought to bear our part of the charge of main|taining of it, or el&s;e have no recour&s;e to it in any ca&s;e whate|ver; for it would be very odd for us to &s;eek protection again&s;t the encroachments or abu&s;e of our fellow creatures, from an autho|rity that we refu&s;e to help to &s;up|port. It may farther be ob&s;erv|ed, that the tribute that Peter paid by our Saviour's direction, was at a time when the Jews were under the Romans and Ce&s;ar at great expence in &s;upporting his legions for the defence of his em|pire: That as Chri&s;t by the hand of Peter, paid a tax, He mu&s;t con&s;equently pay a proportiona|ble part of &s;uch charge.</P>
<P>In one place Chri&s;t &s;aith, <HI>Ren|der to Cae&s;ar the things that are his;</HI> but in the in&s;tance before us, he &s;ets us an example of paying the requi&s;ition of civil authority, not only when the &s;oldiers recei|ved a part of it, but even where not &s;trictly due, rather than give offence; altho' it helped to up|hold a government under which they (<HI>i. c.</HI> the Jews) were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ced by the dint of &s;word; an ex|ample of meekne&s;s that ought to have place in every considerate mind; that whil&s;t we remain &s;tea|dy to our te&s;timony again&s;t &s;hed|ding human blood, we may pre|&s;erve ear con&s;ciences v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">id of of|fence toward God and man, and by no means, at any time, throw out any unbecoming reflections again&s;t tho&s;e in authority, nor mi&s;take will for tender &s;cruple of con&s;cience in paying taxes, or in any thing el&s;e, nor give civil au|thority any unnece&s;&s;ary trouble."</P>
<P>The matter now under con&s;i|deration is &s;erious. Many valua|ble members of &s;ociety, both public and private, at this time, in different places, do not think them&s;elves called or bound to join in the refu&s;als and &s;cruples which &s;ome make, and many more who have not yet fully con&s;idered the matter, will probably be of the &s;ame mind; if this be allowed, which I believe may &s;afely be done, will it not be exceeding hard that they &s;hould be denied the privileges of that &s;ociety, in who&s;e ways they have been edu|cated, and who&s;e religious prin|ciples they profe&s;s and hold, and to which they are clo&s;ely attach|ed? In time pa&s;t, though there was diver&s;ity of &s;entiments with regard to &s;ome matters, yet we bore one with another without cen&s;ure, in that &s;pirit of conde|&s;cen&s;ion and brotherly regard, which is peculiarly characteri&s;tic of the followers of the lamb, and &s;hall we now, in very &s;imilar ca|&s;es, give up that chri&s;tian tem|per, ca&s;t one another off, and produce a &s;paration, when love and union might be pre&s;erved as well as in former days, and for which there is probably as much occa&s;ion as ever there was &s;ince the foundation of the province.</P>
<P>If indeed we think it proper as a &s;ociety, to maintain an oppo|&s;ition to the pre&s;ent powers of government, in civil as well as religious re&s;pects, it may preclude the u&s;e of the pre&s;ent ob&s;ervati|ons, or at lea&s;t render any &s;er|vice, which might be expected
<PB N="19" REF="015843_0020_0F9A2C9ED1C22868">from them, very improbable; but as that would appear to be &s;o contrary to the profe&s;&s;ion we have made, as well as incon&s;i&s;tent with our e&s;tabli&s;hed principles, that I pre&s;ume it cannot really be the ca&s;e: I have therefore taken the freedom of laying the&s;e ob&s;erva|tions before us for our &s;erious con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Never was there a people more deeply intere&s;ted in the event of public proceedings, than we now are. We are con&s;iderably nume|rous in various parts of the conti|nent, and particularly &s;o in this &s;tate. We are not only in|tere&s;ted our&s;elves, but future ge|nerations may likewi&s;e be deeply affected by the part we now act. I wi&s;h us therefore &s;o to conduct, as that Jew nor Gentile, or the church of Chri&s;t, either at this or any future time, may have ju&s;t occa&s;ion of offence.</P>
<P>Now, notwith&s;tanding what has been offered, as there may be &s;ome who may alledge that their &s;cruples and non compliance with the demands of the pre&s;ent go|vernment, as to civil affairs, a|ri&s;es from a principle of con&s;ci|ence, which I am &s;en&s;ible is a very delicate point to touch upon, yet as I have no other end in view, but the good of &s;ociety, as well as individuals, I would therefore beg them to con&s;ider that con|&s;cience, according to the general idea annexed to it, is a very &s;a|cred thing. Let us therefore be cautious how we apply is to com|mon, civil, and merely human affairs, le&s;t we make the plea for it upon more important occa&s;ions of too light ellimation: It is deeply expedient for us to con&s;i|der its nature, or what we are to under&s;tand thereby in religious affairs, and what are the proper and &s;it objects and &s;ubjects there|of, which may be nece&s;&s;ary to claim and a&s;&s;ert as independent of the power of the civil magi&s;|trate: For this purpo&s;e let us ob|&s;erve Rob. Barclay's &s;entiment of the matter, who, in the latter part of the 5th and 6th propo&s;iti|on, after &s;peaking of the light of Chri&s;t, and the light of man's natural con&s;cience, &s;aith, <Q>To the light of Chri&s;t then in the con&s;cience, and not to man's natural con&s;cience, it is that we commend men: This, not that, it is which we preach up and direct people to, as to a mo&s;t certain guide unto eter|nal life.</Q>&mdash;From hence we may &s;afely infer, that no objecti|on ari&s;ing from any thing &s;hort of the light of Chri&s;t, can be &s;uffici|ent to operate with the profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;t our Lord, as a chri&s;tian church, in their proceedings and determinations; &s;o that it e&s;&s;en|tially be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oves them, certainly to know, that it is altogether from the illumination and power there|of, and not at all from the other, that they are a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tuated: &mdash;This appears to be ab&s;o|lutely and indi&s;pen&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> nece&s;&s;a|ry for the right and true &s;upport of a pure chri&s;tian te&s;timony, and which I heartily with only be deeply and &s;ufficiently att<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ded to by all the active members of &s;ociety; for in vain is it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o en|deavour to li&s;t up a &s;tandard to the nations, unle&s;s in and by that power alone which is able to &s;trengthen for the work; without which pure and unmixed qualifi|cation it will prove too large and too heavy; &s;o that being beaten and driven by the winds, it will fall to the ground, to the &s;hame

This (&s;aith h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">) we hold in the negative &mdash; but &s;econdly,&mdash; as we would have the magi&s;trate to avoid this extreme of incroaching upon mens con|&s;ciences; &s;o, on the other hand, we are far from joining with or &s;trengthening &s;uch libertines, as would &s;tretch the liberty of their con&s;ciences to the prejudice of their neighbours, or the ruin of human &s;ociety.&mdash;We under&s;tand therefore <HI>by matters of con&s;cience,</HI> &s;uch as immediately relate be|twixt God and man, or men and men, as to meet together to wor|&s;hip God in that way which they judge is mo&s;t acceptable unto him; and not to incroach upon or feek to force their neighbours, otherwi&s;e than by rea&s;on, or &s;uch other means as Chri&s;t and his a|po&s;tles u&s;ed, viz. preaching, and in&s;tructing &s;uch as will hear and receive it; <HI>but not at all</HI> for men <HI>under the notion</HI> of con&s;cience, to do any thing contrary to the mo|ral and perpetual &s;tatutes <HI>general|ly</HI> acknowledged by all chri&s;tians; in which ca&s;e the magi&s;trate may very lawfully u&s;e his authority." &mdash; The doctrine here preached is excellent both for tho&s;e in, as well as tho&s;e under authority, as it may clearly appear from thence that <HI>"in things religious,"</HI> &s;uch as he there mentions, he appre|hends the magi&s;trate has no ju&s;t power, and that con&s;cience may &s;afely be pleaded; but ob&s;erve the care and caution with which he writes, and how po&s;itively he excludes from that &s;acred claim <Q>any thing that is acted contra|ry to the moral and perpetual &s;tatutes generally acknowledg|ed by all chri&s;tians.</Q>&mdash;But it may be a&s;ked, what are tho&s;e moral and perpetual &s;tatutes? I at once take it for granted, that the laying and paying of Taxes for the &s;upport of human and ci|vil governments, and acknow|ledging the authority of the &s;ame, are material parts; &s;eeing they have been very generally a&s;&s;ented and &s;ubmitted unto by chri&s;tians of all &s;ects and denominations, at and from the per&s;onal appearance of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in all countries, and under all revolu|tions, down to this very day; and without which "human &s;o|ciety" could not be &s;upported, but inevitably verge into confu|&s;ion and ruin:&mdash;From which I would as conci&s;ely as po&s;&s;ible, according to the worthy author's manner, and nearly in his own words, lay down a po&s;ition, and then draw and prove what I ap|prehend to be an undeniable and conclutive argument, as follows: &mdash;Po&s;. That it is unlawful and improper to counteract the moral and perpetual &s;tatutes generally acknowledged by chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>But the laying and paying of Taxes for the &s;upport of human and civil governments, and ac|knowledging the authority of the &s;ame, are of tho&s;e moral and perpetual &s;tatutes, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Therefore, it is unlawful and improper to counteract them.</P>
<P>If the cau&s;e of refu&s;al and non|compliance were a matter of mere
<PB N="21" REF="015843_0022_0F9A2CA051CDD898">faith and con&s;cience toward God, the ca&s;e would be exceedingly different, and there would pro|bably be no di&s;&s;ent; but as it appears to be only of civil con|cern, and relates &s;olely to human affairs, it is therefore apprehend|ed not cen&s;urable by the church, or properly cognizable thereby: And here I cannot but remark one rea&s;on why I believe many among us are led into a mi&s;take, and &s;cruples ari&s;e again&s;t paying of Taxes for want of a well in|formed judgment. It is a receiv|ed opinion among us, that all wars without di&s;tinction are &s;in|ful: Hence ari&s;es this &s;cruple a|gain&s;t paying of Taxes for the &s;upport of war; but this is not the genuine doctrine of our anci|ent friends, as will fully appear in the following extract from the writings of I&s;aac Pennington, where &s;peaking to what he very properly &s;tiles "a weighty que&s;|tion concerning the magi&s;trates protection of the innocent." It is to be ob&s;erved, that this en|lightned author views magi&s;tracy and defen&s;ive war, as the &s;ame thing, or, if I may u&s;e a &s;imile, as one building (tho' con&s;i&s;ting of divers parts) &s;tanding on the &s;ame foundation. The que&s;tion is as follows: Vol. 1&s;t, p. 444. <Q>Whether the magi&s;trate, in righteou&s;ne&s;s and equity, is engaged to defend &s;uch, who (by the peaceablene&s;s and love which God hath wrought in their &s;pirits, and by that law of life, mercy, good-will, and forgivene&s;s, which God, by his own finger, hath written in their hearts) are taken off from fighting, and cannot u&s;e a weapon de&s;tructive to any creature.</Q></P>
<P>An&s;wer: <Q>Magi&s;tracy was in|tended by God for the defence of the people; not only of tho&s;e who have ability, and can fight for them, but of &s;uch al&s;o who cannot, or are for|bidden by the love and law of God, written in their hearts &s;o to do. Thus women, children, &s;ick per&s;ons, aged per&s;ons, and al&s;o prie&s;ts in nations (who have ability to fight, but are exempted by their function, which is not equivalent to the exemption which God makes by the law of his &s;pirit in the heart) have the benefit of the law, and of the magi&s;trates protection, without fighting for the defence of either.</Q></P>
<P>Now if magi&s;tracy be appoint|ed by God, and it be the magi&s;|trates duty to defend &s;uch, who are either not able, or cannot for con&s;cience &s;ake defend them|&s;elves; is it po&s;&s;ible any can be right who lay wa&s;te this ordi|nance, or &s;peak of &s;uch defence as &s;inful? If any man be appoint|ed by God to defend my life, is it po&s;&s;ible that God can authori&s;e me to call him a &s;inner for doing his duty? or is it po&s;&s;ible that I can, con&s;i&s;tent with my duty, re|fu&s;e him that tribute which is ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to enable him thus to defend me? But had I much greater abilities to &s;peak to this &s;ubject than I am con&s;cious of, no rea&s;oning of mine could be of equal authority with the author above quoted. Hear him therefore again, p. 448, where, treating on this peaceable princi|ple profe&s;&s;ed by the &s;ociety, he &s;ays, <Q>I &s;peak not this again&s;t any magi&s;trates or peoples de|fending them&s;elves again&s;t fo|reign inva&s;ions, or making u&s;e
<PB N="22" REF="015843_0023_0F9A2CA10FD4A490">of the &s;word to &s;uppre&s;s the violent and evil-doers within their own borders; <HI>for this the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things may and doth require,</HI> and a great ble&s;|&s;ing will attend the &s;word, when it is uprightly borne to that end, and its u&s;e will be <HI>honourable;</HI> and while there is need of a &s;word, the Lord will not &s;uffer that government, or tho&s;e governors, to want &s;itting in&s;truments under them for the management thereof, who wait on him in his fear to have the edge of it rightly directed; but yet there is a better &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">te which the Lord hath alrealy brought &s;ome into, and which nations are to expect and travel to|wards.</Q></P>
<P>A candid and judicious author, to wit, Richard Finch, in a Treati&s;e called Second Thoughts concerning War, &s;ee page 95, after the above quotation, further adds, <Q>It is evident that this great man holds forth plainly the divine oeconomy I have hinted at above. We &s;ee it was his judgment that men u&s;ing the &s;word, in this go&s;pel day, may be God's in&s;tru|ments; and that herein, tho' not come to the better &s;tate or &s;ummit of chri&s;tian perfection, they may yet be good enough to u&s;e or direct the &s;word to be u&s;ed religiou&s;ly in God's fear: When perhaps many would think that religion in all, in|&s;tead of u&s;ing the &s;word, would if regarded, lead directly from the u&s;e of it; but it &s;eems this writer, though a great advo|cate for our doctrine, thought otherwi&s;e; and I profe&s;s my|&s;elf to be his pro&s;elyte, though at pre&s;ent, it there are a few per&s;ons &s;o pious, I &s;hould al|mo&s;t as &s;oon expect to find the philo&s;ophers &s;tone, as an whole army of &s;uch warriours: And I am per&s;uaded a due regard to what may be urged upon his and my principle, will re|quire more benevolence and reflection of mind than can be expected from unthinking bi|gotry.</Q> Again the &s;ame au|thor, <Q>I admire the wi&s;dom and charity of this writer, in his prudent and generous conce&s;|&s;ions, though &s;ome may think he thereby gives his cau&s;e a|way; but I believe them &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the pre&s;ervation of it, that what he writes is the very truth, and that without &s;uch conce&s;&s;ions it will be im|po&s;&s;ible to maintain our ground again&s;t a keen adver&s;ary. All attempts to explain and defend our doctrine, which go upon the literal &s;en&s;e of the precept, or con&s;ider defen&s;ive war as a thing in it&s;elf wicked, how &s;pecious &s;oever worked up or received by &s;hallow judges, in&s;tead of honouring and &s;erv|ing, have injured a good cau&s;e by multiplying many if not needle&s;s ab&s;urdities and con|tradictions upon all &s;uch ill judged attempts to &s;tate and clear the controver&s;y.</Q> The &s;ame author, page 100: <Q>The &s;word then which in tenderne&s;s of con&s;cience thou can&s;t not draw, may in another (whom for wi&s;e rea&s;ons it hath not plea&s;ed God to lead in the manner he hath cone thee) become the cutward providen|tial means to pre&s;erve thee and others, as well as him&s;elf; up|on which principle his arms may protect thy per&s;on and
<PB N="23" REF="015843_0024_0F9A2CA1D07A4AD0">property, and thy virtue and piety be a defence and ble&s;&s;ing upon his arms.</Q> Again, p. 118: <Q>King William the Third was a great warriour, and a great ble&s;&s;ing to England, as he interpo&s;ed for its deliver|ance in a trying time, when the liberty of the &s;ubject, un|der a &s;pecious &s;olemnity of pre&s;erving is, was &s;ecretly un|dermined; and the great duke of Marlborough, in&s;tead of being convinced of our princi|ple, was a glorious in&s;trument in a warlike way. From what has been laid down we may &s;trongly conclude, that though a mea&s;ure of divine grace, ac|cording to &s;cripture, is given to every man, yet there may be an infinite diver&s;ity in de|grees, and all things con&s;ider|ed, it &s;eems even impo&s;&s;ible that it &s;hould by the giver, in every age and per&s;on, be de|&s;igned to make preci&s;ely the &s;ame di&s;coveries, and exalt to the &s;ame degrees of knowledge and perfection.</Q></P>
<P>The above doctrine corre|&s;ponds with a matter of fact, wherein the apo&s;tle Paul him&s;elf was nearly intere&s;ted: It was at the time when upwards of forty of the Jews had "bound them|&s;elves under a cur&s;e, &s;aying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul." Acts 23d chap. from the 16th to the 24th v. And when Pauls &s;i&s;ter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;on heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the ca&s;|tle, and told Paul. Then Paul called one of the centurious unto him, and &s;aid, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him. So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and &s;aid, Paul the pri&s;oner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath &s;omething to &s;ay unto thee. Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went <HI>with him</HI> a&s;ide privately, and a&s;k|ed <HI>him,</HI> What is that thou ha&s;t to tell me? And he &s;aid, The Jews have agreed to de&s;ire thee that thou woulde&s;t bring down Paul to-morrow into the council, as though they would enquire &s;ome|what of him more perfectly. But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound them&s;elves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promi&s;e from thee. So the chief captain <HI>then</HI> let the young man depart, and charged <HI>him, See thou</HI> tell no man that thou ha&s;t &s;hewed the&s;e things to me. And he called unto him two centuri|ons, &s;aying. Make ready two hundred &s;oldiers to go to Ce&s;area, and hor&s;emen three&s;core and ten, and &s;pearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night. And provide <HI>them</HI> bea&s;ts, that they may &s;et Paul on, and bring <HI>him</HI> &s;afe unto Felix the governor." It is evident here that the apo&s;|tle's life was pre&s;erved through the interpo&s;ition of the chief cap|tain; and Paul he&s;itated not to put him&s;elf under his protection, although he had been previou&s;ly a&s;&s;ured of the Lord's particular providence and protection; the Lord having &s;tood by him, and &s;aid, "Be of good cheer, Paul, for as thou ha&s;t re&s;tined of me in Jeru&s;alem, &s;o mu&s;t thou bear witne&s;s al&s;o at Rome."</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="015843_0025_0F9A2CA2907D9E60">
Upon the whole, much more might be produced to &s;hew that it is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with the doctrines of chri&s;tianity, and the practice of friends to acknowledge allegiance to the government that God, in the cour&s;e of his provi|dence, has thought proper &s;hould take place, and to con&s;cientiou&s;|ly pay our proportion of Taxes for the &s;upport thereof; but it is hoped the above is &s;ufficient with every unprejudiced mind.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Of Government, and the Origin of it.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Government, as 'tis u&s;ually defin'd, is <HI>The care of other peoples &s;afety;</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts in protecting and &s;ecuring them from being de&s;troy'd or oppre&s;s'd by one another, as well as by &s;tran|gers; and redre&s;&s;ing the grievances of tho&s;e who are injur'd, and preventing the like for the future, by puni&s;hing offenders. In order to which, the governor mu&s;t have a right to command the natural force of tho&s;e who expect his protection, to enable him to put his laws and decrees in executi|on. Tho' without power go|vernment cannot con&s;i&s;t, yet pow|er and government are not one and the &s;ame thing; a man may be in the power of another, and yet not be govern'd by him: It is nece&s;&s;ary that this power be made u&s;e of for protection, with|out which 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to be protected; &s;o that protection and government are the &s;ame thing: for where people are not protect|ed, they are &s;till in the &s;tate of nature, and without government.</P>
<P>It is government alone which gives the form, life, and unity to a civil &s;ociety or body politick, by which the &s;everal members have their mutual influence, &s;ym|pathy, and connection: &s;o that to be a member of a civil &s;ociety, and to be under government, is the &s;ame thing; and to be with|out government, and to be in the &s;tate of nature, are reciprocal, and predicated of one another. None can pretend to be, or claim any civil rights as a member of a &s;ociety, without owning the actu|al government which makes it a &s;ociety: and they who di&s;own the government of the &s;ociety they live in, 'do outlaw them|&s;elves, and virtually declare they are no members of it; becau&s;e they have reduc'd them&s;elves to a &s;tate of nature, by di&s;owning there is among them a common judge, who has a right to decide their controver&s;ies, and redre&s;s their injuries, and in who&s;e de|terminations they are oblig'd to acquie&s;ce.</P>
<P>God, who is the author of e|very good thing, may be &s;aid in a more &s;pecial manner to be &s;o of government, becau&s;e 'tis ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to the well-being of mankind; and, by the law of nature, which obliges mankind to act for their good, he has in|&s;tituted it, and by his po&s;itive law &s;ince ratify'd and confirm'd it. Yet he did not con&s;titute any particular form of government, but left mankind at liberty to di&s;po&s;e of them&s;elves, as (when they in&s;tituted &s;ocieties) they thought fit. God was &s;o far from depriving any nation of this liberty, that when he was pleas'd to take upon him the office of a king over his own people the Jews, he fir&s;t requir'd their con|&s;ent; and a contract between God and the people (as is plain by the 19th of <HI>Exodus)</HI> was the
<PB N="26" REF="015843_0027_0F9A2CA41136B530">foundation of the Theocracy. And &s;ince it is not by God's po|&s;itive law, that one form of go|vernment, rather than another, is any where e&s;tabli&s;h'd, there remains no other way by which any government can be erected, or that one man can have a right to command over others, than by the law of nature, or by the con|&s;ent of the parties concern'd. But there is no law of nature for any one form of government, &s;o as to make the re&s;t unlawful, or that one per&s;on rather than another &s;hou'd have the &s;overeign admi|ni&s;tration of affairs: Nor can there be any one law of nature urg'd, why any particular per&s;on &s;hou'd have a power over &s;o many millions of different families, with no manner of relation or dependance one upon another, and who are by nature equal, be|ing of the &s;ame rank, promi&s;cu|ou&s;ly born to the &s;ame advantages of nature, and to the u&s;e of the &s;ame common faculties. And therefore it remains, that govern|ment mu&s;t be deriv'd from con|&s;ent.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>Of the Publick Good.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Suppo&s;e I need not &s;pend ma|ny words to &s;hew the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of government, for the good and well-being of mankind; or that it was for no other rea&s;on that men parted with their liber|ties (for what el&s;e cou'd be an e|quivalent?) than the mutual de|fence and &s;ecurity they receive by government, which is the &s;ole de&s;ign and end of all laws, pu|ni&s;hments and rewards. As this rea&s;on was at fir&s;t the &s;ole motive for &s;ubmitting to particular per|&s;ons, &s;o 'tis the only rea&s;on &s;till for continuing allegiance to them; and when this rea&s;on cea&s;es, na|tural liberty returns, and then men are oblig'd, for the &s;ake of their own &s;afety and pre&s;ervation, to pay allegiance where 'tis mo&s;t for their intere&s;t and advantage.</P>
<P>Obedience is due to govern|ment, and not to the per&s;on who governs, but on the account and for the &s;ake of it; otherwi&s;e peo|ple might be oblig'd to pay alle|giance to a king after he had re|&s;ign'd his regal office. <HI>'Tis im|po&s;&s;ible for a king to lo&s;e his go|vernment, and not lo&s;e the allegi|ance of his &s;ubjects, becau&s;e they are relatives;</HI> and according to the nature of all relatives, one cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without the other.</P>
<P>Natural relations, as that be|tween father and &s;on, la&s;t as long as both parties live; but tho&s;e which are artificial (if I may &s;o term 'em) as between ma&s;ter and &s;ervant, king and &s;ubject, may be de&s;troy'd during their lives: and when the&s;e relations cea&s;e, all obligations on both &s;ides cea&s;e. The relation between &s;overeign and &s;ubjects is de&s;troy'd, when the &s;overeign will no longer pro|tect his people, and &s;o freely withdraws from the government; or when he is depriv'd of the power of protecting 'em, and &s;o is driven from his government:
<PB N="27" REF="015843_0028_0F9A2CA4D094EF20">which, as to the people, (for who&s;e &s;ake government was in&s;ti|tuted) has the &s;ame effect: and they equally lo&s;e that protection and defence for the &s;ake of which alone allegiance is paid, whether the &s;overeign will not or cannot any longer govern 'em, and is forc'd to leave his government in the hands of others, whereby tho&s;e who were his &s;ubjects are as incapable of paying him allegi|ance, as he is to protect 'em; and the &s;ame force which ju&s;tifies his leaving 'em, will equally ju&s;tify their transferring their allegiance. And &s;ince no &s;ociety is able to &s;ub&s;i&s;t without having ju&s;tice ad|mini&s;ter'd, and enjoying tho&s;e other ble&s;&s;ings deriv'd from go|vernment; either they mu&s;t by living without government be|come a prey to every one, or el&s;e there is a nece&s;&s;ity of pre&s;erving them&s;elves by paying allegiance to the new government.</P>
<P>For none can have a right in|con&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>publick good,</HI> which <HI>is the only fundamental law of all &s;ocieties;</HI> contrary to which, no law (and con&s;equently no le|gal right, which is built upon law) can be valid; to which, as to a center, each man's actions ought to tend, becau&s;e the more univer&s;al any good is, the more it ought to be imbrac'd: And <HI>&s;ocieties cou'd not &s;ub&s;i&s;t, but mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily fall into a &s;tate of war and confu&s;ion, if every man &s;hou'd prefer the advantage of any parti|cular per&s;on before the good of the whole.</HI></P>
<P>As every particular per&s;on's intere&s;t mu&s;t yield to the general good of the &s;ociety, &s;o mu&s;t that of a particular &s;ociety to the more univer&s;al good of all &s;ocieties; and no principles can be true, (however they may &s;erve a parti|cular turn) which, if generally practis'd, wou'd be again&s;t the good of all &s;ocieties. But no|thing can be more de&s;tructive and pernicious to all human &s;ocieties, than tho&s;e principles which a&s;&s;ert that allegiance mu&s;t be only paid to him who has a legal title; be|cau&s;e it mu&s;t oblige va&s;t numbers in all revolutions to be de&s;troy'd for the &s;ake of a &s;ingle per&s;on, rather than &s;ubmit to another who is in the &s;ame &s;tation, and by who&s;e power they might be govern'd and protected.</P>
<P>Can it be &s;uppos'd, that when men &s;ubmitted to government, (becau&s;e 'twas ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;a|ry for their pre&s;ervation) they did it on &s;uch terms, as &s;hou'd oblige 'em in &s;o many ca&s;es to run into tho&s;e inconveniences which they de&s;ir'd to &s;hun, rather than live peaceably under a government which actually protects 'em?</P>
<P>Nothing can ju&s;tify &s;uch prin|ciples, unle&s;s the <HI>mi&s;ery</HI> and <HI>de|&s;truction,</HI> not the <HI>pre&s;ervation</HI> of human &s;ocieties, be the <HI>&s;upreme law;</HI> or that 'tis a &s;in to act for the general good of a &s;ociety, and a duty in the people to expo&s;e them&s;elves to certain de&s;truction, rather than act for their own good in a matter &s;olely in&s;tituted for their benefit.</P>
<P>A man may be oblig'd to &s;uf|fer rather than act again&s;t his duty; but that he &s;hou'd be o|blig'd to &s;uffer rather than do his duty, in promoting the general good of the nation, is a &s;trange paradox. If it be a duty to act for the publick good, and the general intere&s;t of a &s;ociety; and it the more univer&s;al the good be, the more it ought to be &s;ought for; then the means nece&s;&s;ary to

<P>The paying obedience to tho&s;e in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, is a doctrine which tends &s;o much to the intere&s;t of human &s;ocieties, and of all the particular members thereof, that even they who oppo&s;e it, did they con&s;ult their own happine&s;s, mu&s;t wi&s;h it were true: And what greater argument can there be of the truth of it, than that 'tis &s;o conducive to the good of of mankind?</P>
<P>And that common objection, or rather reflection, That 'tis in|tere&s;t makes the&s;e tenets, which require obedience to the pre&s;ent government, &s;o univer&s;ally im|brac'd, (however uncharitably de&s;ign'd) is &s;o far from de&s;troy|ing the credit of 'em, that 'tis a demon&s;tration of their truth; be|cau&s;e they are for the good of particulars, of which the publick is made up.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. <HI>Of the Obligation of Human Laws.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ALL writers allow, That the leagues and contracts which princes make with one another, do oblige them no longer than they are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their kingdoms; becau&s;e the &s;ole rea|&s;ons of making the&s;e leagues were upon the power each king|dom had to afford mutual a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance and benefit to one another. And if this be a con&s;tant practice with kings, that their treaties o|blige them no longer than while each king has po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his kingdom; why will they not al|low the &s;ame rea&s;on to hold for &s;ubjects, that they &s;hou'd be free from all obligations to princes, when they no longer receive any protection from 'em? Seeing that was the only ground and &s;ole cau&s;e of their paying allegiance; and in truth they cannot be any longer oblig'd, than the rea&s;on for obliging 'em holds. For why &s;hou'd people be oblig'd, when there is no rea&s;on they &s;hou'd be &s;o? No laws can bind any longer, than the rea&s;on for enacting 'em holds good; and when the &s;ole rea&s;on which made 'em laws cea&s;es, the laws them|&s;elves mu&s;t &s;o too: much more mu&s;t any particular law be null and void, when not only the rea|&s;on of keeping it cea&s;es, but the keeping it thwarts the general intent of all laws, which is the happine&s;s of the &s;ocieties, to which all laws are but means: and there is no rea&s;on that the means &s;hou'd oblige, when the end for who&s;e &s;ake the means were ordain'd cannot be obtain'd by tho&s;e means, much le&s;s when they become de&s;tructive of the &s;ole end for which they were or|dain'd.</P>
<P>If there were a law that &s;hips &s;hou'd &s;ail on &s;uch a &s;ide of the channel, and the &s;ole rea&s;on, whether expre&s;s'd or not, were for avoiding the dangerous &s;ands on the other &s;ide; &s;hou'd the

So again, if a law, which re|quir'd obedience to one particu|lar per&s;on, &s;hou'd happen to be de&s;tructive of the publick good, and of fatal con&s;equence to the community, the letter of the law wou'd oblige no more in one ca&s;e than in the other; nay, the rea|&s;on of not ob&s;erving the la&s;t wou'd be &s;tronger on account of the di&s;proportion of the number: But the true meaning and intent of the law wou'd in one ca&s;e as well as the other, oblige people to act contrary to the letter of it; and they wou'd be as much bound to pay obedience, where 'tis for the publick good, as in the other ca&s;e the &s;hip wou'd be to &s;ail on the &s;afe &s;ide of the channel.</P>

<P>Object. THO' <HI>the good of the &s;ociety be &s;uppos'd the grand ultimate law, yet tho&s;e principles, which require obedience to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, cannot be true, be|cau&s;e they are again&s;t the peace and happine&s;s of nations, by incouraging rebellion again&s;t all princes, in o|bliging people to pay the &s;ame alle|giance, 'ven to tho&s;e who unju&s;tly depo&s;e' em.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> The&s;e principles are &s;o far from being de&s;tructive to the peace and quiet of nations, or incouraging rebellion again&s;t their governors, that they require obe|dience to all in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, upon pain of damnation; but if nei|ther the fear of eternal puni&s;h|ment in the next life, nor the &s;e|vere&s;t which can be inflicted upon 'em in this, can &s;ecure people from rebelling, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I know nothing that can. It is the duty of all &s;ubjects to do their utmo&s;t to defend the government; that's only a ju&s;t return, and what's due for its protecting and defending 'em: But if by the chance of war, or any other way, it &s;hou'd lo&s;e the power of pro|tecting 'em, they are not oblig'd to have their throats cut, rather than pay allegiance to that go|vernment, by who&s;e &s;avour and protection they &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and enjoy what they have. And that prince is very unrea&s;onable, and acts a|gain&s;t the rules of humanity as well as charity, who when able no longer to protect the people, wou'd rather have 'em de&s;troy'd, than own that government which can.</P>
<P>Nothing can ju&s;tify &s;uch an inhuman and barbarous opinion, unle&s;s it can be prov'd that men enter'd into &s;ocieties barely for the &s;ake and intere&s;t of a &s;ingle per&s;on; and that if his plea&s;ure or profit require it, millions of lives mu&s;t be indi&s;pen&s;ably &s;acri|fic'd. This is to place men in a wor&s;e condition than bea&s;ts, if they are in con&s;cience oblig'd to lo&s;e their lives to gratify the un|limited
<PB N="30" REF="015843_0031_0F9A2CA7118C33E8">pride, ambition, revenge, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> intere&s;t of a &s;ingle per&s;on.</P>
<P>It is &s;trange that any <HI>Engli&s;h|men,</HI> who are the free&s;t nation in the world, &s;hou'd think they are no other than the King's proper|ty: Tho' 'tis but rea&s;onable that men who de&s;ign to bring the mo&s;t in&s;upportable &s;lavery on them|&s;elves, &s;hou'd be qualify'd for it by notions and principles &s;o much below the dignity of human na|ture. While the contrary prin|ciples are &s;o far from being any ways prejudicial to mankind; that it is they alone which in all revolutions can &s;ecure human &s;o|cieties, and make governments ea&s;y and &s;afe both to kings and &s;ubjects, by putting an end to tho&s;e otherwi&s;e endle&s;s di&s;putes of titles. And princes may with|out fears or jealou&s;ies mind the publick good, becau&s;e it &s;ecures them who are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion again&s;t all pretences.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t that can be objected is, That a prince who has once lo&s;t his dominions, may by the&s;e principles chance to lo&s;e the hopes of ever recovering 'em again.</P>
<P>A prince unju&s;tly expelled, ought to acquie&s;ce, if he has no way of recovering his kingdom but by di&s;turbing the peace and quiet of a nation; he ought not to make u&s;e of &s;uch unlawful means for the recovery of his kingdom: and certainly others can have no rea&s;on to act again&s;t the good of the community for his intere&s;t, when he him&s;elf is oblig'd not to act.</P>
<P>The intere&s;t of a prince is only more &s;acred than another's, when that of the publick is involv'd in it; but when that is no longer concern'd in his actions, he cea&s;es to be the publick per&s;on, and is upon equal terms with other pri|vate men, and ought as well as any other to acquie&s;ce, rather than di&s;turb the quiet of a nation. And there is then the &s;ame rea&s;on for not endeavouring to re&s;tore him, as there was at fir&s;t for not turning him out.</P>
<P>All the ill con&s;equences which can happen in this ca&s;e are, That the le&s;s hopes princes have of be|ing re&s;tor'd by &s;uch unlawful means, the more careful (it's hop'd) they will be in governing the commonwealth, and more a|fraid of arbitrary and illegal practices.</P>
<P>Object. <HI>If all per&s;ons, how un|ju&s;tly &s;oever they get a crown, have the &s;ame right to the obedience of the people, to wit their con&s;ent, then there can be no &s;uch thing as an u&s;urper.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> He who without any ju&s;t cau&s;e de&s;troys the right which any prince has to the allegiance of his &s;ubjects, by making him uncapable to protect 'em, and protects 'em him&s;elf, may be call'd an u&s;urper: Tho' the peo|ple by the former prince's lo&s;ing his power to protect 'em, are re|duc'd to the &s;tate of nature, and by con&s;equence free from any al|legiance; and may lawfully, or rather are oblig'd (every one el&s;e being out of a capacity to protect 'em) to con&s;ent to be govern'd by him who has the power to protect 'em; who being &s;o cho&s;en, has the only right a king can have, the con&s;ent of the people, who are as much oblig'd to obey him, as they are any king whatever. The former king is &s;o far then from being their legal king, that he is none at all, nor has any manner of right to their allegi|ance. 'Tis true, the u&s;urper
<PB N="31" REF="015843_0032_0F9A2CA846E03548">having done him anjury, ought to make him &s;atisfaction, and (if he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n without any damage to the publick) to place him in that condition he was in before he made him uncapable to protect the people; who then, for the &s;ake of protection which they re|ceive from him, are oblig'd to pay him obedience. The having a right to be re&s;tor'd by the u&s;ur|per, is the only right a prince unju&s;tly depriv'd of his regal of|fice can pretend to. And when I &s;peak of his legal right, I mean only this by it: Among the <HI>Jews,</HI> tho' none cou'd have a le|gal right except one of their own nation, becau&s;e they were oblig'd by God him&s;elf to chu&s;e a king from among their brethren, and God afterward entail'd the crown on the po&s;terity of <HI>David;</HI> yet when the&s;e were di&s;abled to pro|tect the people by their being in the power of &s;trangers, 'twas &s;o far from being a crime, that 'twas their duty (notwith&s;tanding the divine legal right any of their brethren cou'd pretend to) to pay allegiance to 'em, tho' for the mo&s;t part they were u&s;urpers, having no ju&s;t cau&s;e to conquer 'em.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. <HI>Of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ALL writers, I think, allow, that after a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a long continuance (tho' they ex|tremely differ how much time is nece&s;&s;ary) a right accrues to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, tho' there are &s;ome of the right line &s;till in being. If it be unju&s;t to pay the fir&s;t po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or obedience, I don't &s;ee how a long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion can alter the ca&s;e. A continuance in an in|ju&s;tice may make the inju&s;tice greater, but not alter the nature of things, and make the greate&s;t wrong to be right: Though all things are done in time, yet time it&s;elf operates nothing.</P>
<P>This mi&s;take, like many o|thers, is occa&s;ion'd by the paral|lel men draw between private per&s;ons (who are ty'd up by laws enacted by the &s;upreme powers) and the &s;upreme powers them|&s;elves. By the laws of mo&s;t na|tions, if private men neglect to make a legal demand of their rights in a certain time appointed they lo&s;e 'em, and a right accures to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; but this depends on a law enacted by the &s;upreme powers, who have a right to di&s;|po&s;e of private e&s;tates as they judge be&s;t for the publick good, who&s;e laws can oblige only their own &s;ubjects. But what authority have the &s;ubjects, or the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, to di&s;po&s;e of the legal prince's rights? Be&s;ides, it might ju&s;tly be imputed to a private man's own neglect, if, when the law is open, he does not recover his right: It may well be pre&s;um'd he has relinqui&s;h'd it. But that can't be &s;aid of a prince who has no court of ju&s;tice to appeal to, or any other likely way to reco|ver his right; yet by bearing the arms and title, and by other ways, &s;till a&s;&s;erts his right.</P>
<P>How numerous are the in&s;tan|ces
<PB N="32" REF="015843_0033_0F9A2CA8917A49F8">of princes po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of territo|ries belonging to others, and who have been &s;o for a great many years? Yet none dare affirm, the &s;ubjects who pay'em allegiance, are, and have been all along trai|tors. To give but one in&s;tance among hundreds: The kings of <HI>England</HI> have a right to the king|dom of <HI>France,</HI> and have con|&s;tantly claim'd it by cau&s;ing them&s;elves to be &s;til'd kings of <HI>France,</HI> and by bearing the arms of that crown; yet none will con|demn the <HI>French</HI> as traitors, who have all along paid allegiance to the <HI>French</HI> kings. But if the kings of <HI>England</HI> by tract of time lo&s;t their right to the obedience of the <HI>French.</HI> and before that time 'twas trea&s;on for tho&s;e of that na|tion to pay allegiance to the <HI>French</HI> kings, I &s;hou'd be glad to know what month, or year, it ceas'd to be trea&s;on; for 'tis a thing of mighty con&s;equence to know how long 'tis trea&s;on to o|bey a king in pe&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and when it becomes trea&s;on not to obey him. In &s;hort, if a king can have a right to a country, and it be no crime in tho&s;e of that country not to pay him alle|giance, it demon&s;trates that alle|giance is not annex'd to the title, but is due to the per&s;on who pro|tects 'em.</P>
<P>Object. <HI>Tho' time does not give a right, yet the acts, or the no acts, that is, the omi&s;&s;ion of &s;ome, may in time amount to a re&s;ignation of the right of the legal prince to the u|&s;urpers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> I grant a man's mind may be expre&s;s'd by acts as well as words; yet 'twou'd be very hard to condemn all tho&s;e of trea|&s;on who have paid allegiance to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, before they had &s;ufficient grounds to believe, the legal prince or his heirs had by their acts (if &s;uch acts cou'd de|&s;troy the right of the next of kin) re&s;ign'd their and their legal &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors right to the u&s;urper. In how few ca&s;es is there rea&s;on for &s;uch pre&s;umption? If till then all people &s;hou'd be oblig'd to be de&s;troy'd rather than pay allegi|ance, what a de&s;truction wou'd it make in the world: Wou'd it not in mo&s;t ca&s;es expo&s;e, at lea&s;t the good and con&s;cientious, to certain ruin? And others cou'd not pre|&s;erve them&s;elves without a &s;in, the reward of which is damnation.</P>
<P>Long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is not at all ne|ce&s;&s;ary to ju&s;tify the peoples obe|dience; for that very moment the people receive protection and de|fence from the new powers, they ought to pay 'em the &s;ame allegi|ance as if they had been in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the government a thou|&s;and years. The le&s;s time a na|tion has been &s;ettled, the more need it has of re&s;t and peace, and the more dangerous wou'd any violent revolution be.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. <HI>Of Protection.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IF any wou'd not be thought enemies to the &s;ociety, but part of it, ought they not to act equally with the re&s;t for the peace and quiet of it, and &s;ubmit to the head, that rules and governs it? How can they pretend to be members of the &s;ociety, and con|&s;equently claim any civil rights by being &s;o, without owning the actual government which makes 'em so? Do they not, by di&s;own|ing it, renounce the benefit of the laws (which only can be put in execution by the government) and out-law them&s;elves? How can they have any more right to the protection of the government, if they out law them&s;elves, than if the government, by putting 'em out of its protection, had out-law'd 'em? So that 'tis whol|ly by the favour of the govern|ment (for they have no true pre|tence to 'em) that they enjoy any legal rights. If they think they &s;hou'd be &s;everely dealt with, did not the government protect 'em, why do they not what is nece&s;&s;ary to enable the government to pro|tect 'em? If they will the con&s;e|quence, the protection of the go|vernment, ought they not to will the antecedent, all that is nece&s;|&s;ary to it? And if it be lawful to de&s;ire and to receive the advan|tages which flow from govern|ment (which I &s;uppo&s;e no Jaco|bite will be &s;o hardy as to deny) why mu&s;t not the means nece&s;&s;ary to obtain the&s;e advantages, be &s;o too?</P>
<P>How can they who are willing to be protected by any per&s;on, be unwilling (except they de&s;ire contradictions) that he &s;hou'd have a power to govern 'em, &s;ince without &s;uch a power he can't protect 'em? And they who are willing to receive a univer&s;al pro|tection, are pre&s;um'd to be will|ing to pay all obedience nece&s;&s;ary for that end; which is as univer|&s;al as the protection they expect. 'Tis evident, that he who is wil|ling to receive a univer&s;al pro|tection from a government, is willing that the government &s;hou'd have a coercive power o|ver all others, to re&s;train 'em from injuring him; and that it &s;hou'd have &s;ufficient authority to do ju&s;tice, and oblige all to pay obedience to the laws, when put in execution for his &s;ake, becau&s;e in it wholly con&s;i&s;ts his protecti|on: And he who is for the go|vernment's having power over all other people on his account, ought to be willing it &s;hou'd have the &s;ame over him, for the &s;ake of others, except he'd be the on|ly man in the nation without go|vernment; and is unwilling to do that him&s;elf, which he'd have all others (whatever their principles are) to do.</P>
<P>If the <HI>nonjurors</HI> de&s;ire to be protected, and do actually receive the protection of the government (tho' at the &s;ame time they pre|tend 'tis again&s;t their con&s;ciences) 'tis manife&s;t they own the go|vernment, and by their actions
<PB N="34" REF="015843_0035_0F9A2CAA11607898">con&s;ent to &s;ubmit to it: And what force can a prote&s;tation have again&s;t their own acts?</P>
<P>Do not all who go into any fo|reign princes dominions, during their &s;tay, by receiving the pro|tection of the government, own them&s;elves &s;ubject to it (except emba&s;&s;adors, over whom &s;ove|reigns have agreed to &s;u&s;pend the exerci&s;e of their right) and are they not oblig'd equally with the natives, to pay allegiance; and alike guilty of trea&s;on, and &s;o try'd, if they attempt any thing again&s;t it? And upon this head, all private attempts upon a prince in his own country, have been abhor'd by all nations: and they who de&s;ign'd any thing of this nature, have not been treated as ju&s;t enemies, tho' in time of war; becau&s;e 'tis pre&s;um'd, they enter as &s;ubjects into the dominions of that prince who protects 'em.</P>
<P>By examining what 'tis which gives government a right to the obedience of men who are by nature free, twill the better ap|pear what right the pre&s;ent go|vernment has to the allegiance of tho&s;e it protects.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on u&s;ually given, why people are oblig'd to obey any particular government, is (no prince being ridiculous enough to pretend a right, as the fir&s;t-born in a direct line from <HI>Adam</HI> or <HI>No|ah</HI>) becau&s;e 'twas the intent of tho&s;e who fir&s;t form'd the &s;ociety, that &s;uch per&s;on, and their &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors (if they made the govern|ment hereditary) &s;hou'd have a right to govern the nation for e|ver. But how cou'd they, who&s;e authority with their being ceas'd &s;o long &s;ince, oblige the con&s;ci|ences of tho&s;e who were not then in being? Or how cou'd any acts or compacts of their ance&s;tors take away the natural liberty of tho&s;e who were born &s;o many years after, and who have the &s;ame right to freedom as they had? Or how cou'd their com|pacts oblige tho&s;e who are not de|&s;cended from 'em, but come from other countries into the &s;ociety; and make it a &s;in in them not to obey the pre&s;ent governors of any &s;ociety, on who&s;e authority alone and not on the founders of the &s;ociety, depends the validity of ali former laws, which can only bind, becau&s;e 'tis the will of the pre&s;ent powers they &s;hou'd? o|therwi&s;e no laws cou'd be repeal'd if their very being did not depend upon the plea&s;ure of the pre&s;ent &s;upreme powers, who de&s;ign they &s;hall oblige, till they declare the contrary.</P>
<P>Every per&s;on, tho' born free, yet he is for the &s;ake of his own &s;afety oblig'd to part with his li|berty, and put him&s;elf under the protection of government. Nor can he be &s;ecure in what he en|joys any other way. Nor can he have a right in a country (which is already po&s;&s;e&s;t) to any thing, but by owning the government of that country. And by pre|tending to the privileges the re&s;t of the &s;ociety enjoy, he has own'd him&s;elf a member of the &s;ociety, and a &s;ubject of the government of it. And this is the only way that any (except by verbal pro|mi&s;es) con&s;ent to become &s;ubject to a government.</P>
<P>Whatever &s;ociety people chance to be members of, whether their native or any other, they are dur|ing their &s;tay equally oblig'd, for the &s;ake of the protection they receive, to pay allegiance to the governors of that &s;ociety. 'Tis

<P>Tho' they who re&s;ide in a fo|reign &s;ociety are equally &s;ubject with the natives to the laws of it, and by oppo&s;ing the government wou'd be equally guilty of trea|&s;on; yet if during their &s;tay, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> alteration happens in the govern|ment contrary to the laws, they never &s;cruple to pay allegiance to him who gets po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the go|vernment, tho' his title be ever &s;o illegal I &s;ee no rea&s;on why they &s;hou'd not do the &s;ame in their fir&s;t &s;ociety, &s;ince whatever &s;oci|ety they are in during their &s;tay, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">y are equally oblig'd to ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y the laws of it.</P>

<P>Such oaths, if ever they were impos'd, wou'd be &s;o far from binding, that they wou'd be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ull upon the account of the &s;infulne&s;;
<PB N="36" REF="015843_0037_0F9A2CAB90847078">of 'em, as being directly again&s;t the good of human &s;ociety. In all promi&s;es and oaths concerning things not moral, this tacit con|dition is always included, of their not being, or upon altera|tion of the circum&s;tances becom|ing contrary to the publick good: and this is without all doubt to be ob&s;erv'd about government, becau&s;e 'twas in&s;tituted for no o|ther rea&s;on than the publick good.</P>
<P>Oaths do not alter the nature of allegiance, or make it due where it was not before; or any ways extend it, but only add a new tie to pay that allegiance which is due on the account of protection. He who lives under a government, tho' he has not &s;worn to it, owes it the &s;ame al|legiance as he who has; and if he &s;hou'd deny his allegiance to it, wou'd be equally guilty of trea&s;on, though not of perjury. 'Tis evident by the univer&s;al practice of mankind, that no &s;ubjects ever thought them&s;elves oblig'd by their oaths of fidelity, which governments have con|&s;tantly impos'd on 'em, when they ceas'd to be protected by 'em. The legi&s;lative power, e|&s;pecially where the people have a &s;hare in it, are pre&s;um'd to re|cede as little as po&s;&s;ible from na|tural equity, and to de&s;ign, by impo&s;ing &s;uch oaths, the good and pre&s;ervation of the &s;ociety; who&s;e intere&s;t it is, that they who have the publick admini&s;tration of affairs &s;hou'd not be di&s;turb'd. But 'tis not at all material whe|ther this or that man, provided they are well manag'd, has the direction of 'em: Nor can it without the greate&s;t ab&s;urdity be &s;uppos'd, that &s;uch numbers of men as &s;ocieties are compos'd of, who are by nature equal, &s;hou'd oblige them&s;elves by the mo&s;t &s;o|lemn ues to become mo&s;t mi&s;era|ble, by living without protecti|on; nay, to lo&s;e even their lives rather than own the government which can protect 'em, for no o|ther rea&s;on than barely an extra|ordinary fondne&s;s to one of their number, to give him not the ne|ce&s;&s;aries or real conveniences of life, but only an office (for go|vernment is no other) which is but an imaginary happine&s;s: For it government were a real happi|ne&s;s to the per&s;ons who po&s;&s;e&s;s it, &s;everal upon their parting with it wou'd not have found them&s;elves happier than before. That peo|ple &s;hou'd be true to tho&s;e who have the admini&s;tration of civil affairs, is all which oaths of fide|lity require; and 'tis evident by the words of it, that the late oath of allegiance requir'd no more; and to extend it further than the power in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, is not recon|cilable with the rea&s;on, end, and de&s;ign of paying obedience, which is the peace and happine&s;s of the &s;ociety, and which can never be maintain'd, if people may, for the take of a &s;ingle per&s;on, di&s;|turb 'em who have the admini|&s;tration of their common affairs: and 'twoud require impo&s;&s;ibili|ties, becau&s;e a private per&s;on is incapable of paying allegiance to a king when out of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the government.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> Of Proofs of Scripture concerning Obedience to tho&s;e who actually admini&s;ter Government.</HEAD>
<P>CHRIST in the directions he gave, <HI>Mat.</HI> 23, to his di&s;|ciples, and to the multitude, about their behaviour to the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, requires obedience to be paid 'em only on the account of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; &s;aying, <HI>The Scribes and Phari&s;ees &s;it in</HI> Mo&s;es's <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, all therefore what&s;o|ever they bid you ob&s;erve, that ob|&s;erve and do.</HI> And he gives no other rea&s;on for this great obedi|ence in doing and ob&s;erving whatever they command, than becau&s;e they &s;at in <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s &s;ear; that is, were po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s authority, who in the Theocracy was the chief magi&s;trate. Not that the Scribes and Phari&s;ees had &s;o great a power as <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> but as far as they did enjoy his &s;eat, throne and authority, &s;o far they were to be obey'd: They were then the greate&s;t, as well as chief|e&s;t part of the grand <HI>Sanhedrin,</HI> which in all cau&s;es where the <HI>Ro|mans</HI> had left the <HI>Jews</HI> to their liberty, had the &s;upreme power both in civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters. (There were not in the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> republick two di&s;tinct in|dependent powers, one for civil, another for eccle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;es) If the people were then oblig'd to pay &s;o great obedience, barely on account of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, why may not the &s;ame direction &s;erve for a &s;tanding rule to the multitude in all times? And not only to the inferiors, but even to the &s;u|preme magi&s;trate him&s;elf, Chri&s;t requires obedience on no other account than that of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. If <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI> be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the empire, as it did appear by his coining of money, and &s;tamping his image upon it, that being a mark of &s;overeignty and empire, but not of any legal title to it; then <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI> is to have tribute and all other parts of allegiance paid him.</P>
<P>And St. <HI>Paul</HI> in expre&s;s terms requires obcoience to <HI>the powers which be,</HI> and declares there is no power but what is from God. The Jews being influenc'd by the Prie&s;ts and Phari&s;ees, and o|blig'd by their law to place no &s;tranger over 'em, &s;crupl'd to pay obedience to the <HI>Roman</HI> emperors, becau&s;e they were &s;trangers, and not capable of a legal right; not con&s;idering that the law oblig'd 'em only when it was in their own choice, and not when they were under the power of the <HI>Romans,</HI> to whom for the &s;ake of pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">cti|on they were oblig'd to pay obe|dience. St. <HI>Paul</HI> therefore, to take away the&s;e &s;cruples, a&s;&s;ures 'em all powers are from God: But had he only meant legal powers, &s;ince only Jews were ca|pable of being &s;uch, he had con|firm'd 'em in their error. But the rea&s;on why he obliges men to &s;ubmit, will demon&s;trate that all actual rulers are meant, and only they, becau&s;e they alone are a terror to evil works, and a prai&s;e to the good; none but the <HI>actual
<PB N="38" REF="015843_0039_0F9A2CAD10D24640">ruler is a mini&s;ter of God, a re|venger to execute wrath upon him who does evil, or a mini&s;ter of God for good.</HI> What can more fully demon&s;trate that the rea&s;on of o|bedience is for the benefits men receive by government? And what makes the crime of re&s;i&s;ting 'em &s;o great, is, that men oppo&s;e tho&s;e by whom they receive &s;o many advantages: It is, becau&s;e they have the power of the &s;word (which includes all manner of puni&s;hment) by which they &s;e|cure and protect their &s;ubjects from all manner of injury and violence from ill men. And be|ing mini&s;ters of God for good, includes all the good they receive both to their per&s;ons and proper|ties: <HI>for which cau&s;e you pay tri|bute al&s;o, for they are God's mini+&s;ters, continually attending upon this very thing.</HI> 'Tis their di&s;|pen&s;ing the&s;e advantages to man|kind, that makes 'em God's mi|ni&s;ters and God's ordinance; the &s;cripture affirming tho&s;e things which are nece&s;&s;ary for the good of mankind to come from God, as plowing and &s;owing, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 28, 23 &mdash;29. If it once be known, as the di&s;covery can't be difficult, who 'tis that bears the &s;word, who admini&s;ters ju&s;tice, who re|wards, and who puni&s;hes; and the apo&s;tle's word may be taken, &s;ubjection is not only due to him for wrath, but for con&s;cience|&s;ake. And the &s;ame apo&s;tle ex|horts, That <HI>prayers be made for kings, and all in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty.</HI> The&s;e rea&s;ons can only concern tho&s;e who have actual power and authority, by who&s;e protection they who live under 'em may lead &s;uch lives; and if it be our duty to pray that we may lead &s;uch lives, it mu&s;t be our duty to enable them who have authority over us, to &s;ecure us in the en|joyment of a peaceable and quiet life.</P>
<P>And St. <HI>Peter</HI> for the &s;ame rea|&s;on requires people to &s;ubmit to the &s;upreme magi&s;trate, whom he calls <HI>the ordinance of man;</HI> &s;o that 'tis plain, that God by approving this human ordinance, approves it as human, and requires obedi|ence to it for the &s;ame rea&s;ons that men a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> fir&s;t inftituted it. And 'tis the power governors have to do good, which makes 'em to be not only God's ordinance, and God's mini&s;ters, but even Gods: for &s;ince they are not Gods by nature (tho' by &s;ome peoples way of arguing one wou'd &s;uppo&s;e they thought 'em &s;uch, or at lea&s;t beings in them&s;elves &s;uperior to to the re&s;t of mankind) it mu&s;t be for the protection they afford that they are term'd &s;o; who when they no longer protect the people, cea&s;e to be a human or|dinance, and then too they cea&s;e to be a divine one. And the &s;ame rea&s;on which obliges people to &s;ubmit to 'em, when they act for the good of the &s;ociety, as much obliges people to oppo&s;e 'em, if they de&s;ign to ruin and de&s;troy 'em. It can't well be &s;uppos'd, that God, who has o|blig'd mankind to pre&s;erve their lives, and con&s;equently to u&s;e the means nece&s;&s;ary for that end, &s;hou'd require people to &s;uffer them&s;elves to be de&s;troy'd, only to gratify the lu&s;t or barbarity of a &s;ingle per&s;on, or a few, who are by nature but their equals, and only above 'em by being in an office which they erected only for their convenience.</P>

Object. <HI>St.</HI> Paul <HI>makes no man|ner of exception, but declares,</HI> Whoever re&s;i&s;ts &s;hall receive dam|nation.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> As the apo&s;tle requires obedience to parents in all things; and to ma&s;ters, hu&s;bands, pa&s;tors, without mentioning any excepti|ons: &s;o here he declares (which was &s;ufficient for his purpo&s;e) that all people ought to obey the &s;upreme powers, without menti|oning this exception: which ne|ce&s;&s;arily flows from the nature, end, and de&s;ign of government, and even from tho&s;e rea&s;ons he gives for obedience.</P>
<P>It can't be pre&s;um'd that Chri&s;t authoriz'd his apo&s;tles to make &s;laves of mankind, by giving the emperors a new power, who be|fore by no law of God or nature had &s;uch a power over peoples lives. All the power the <HI>Roman</HI> government had, was immediate|ly from the people; who, as 'tis plain in hi&s;tory, by their mutual con&s;ent erected that common|wealth: and what power the em|perors had, was given 'em too by the people, who by the <HI>Lex Regia</HI> confer'd it upon 'em.</P>
<P>All that can be deduc'd from &s;cripture is, That obedience is due to tho&s;e who protect the peo|ple; and nothing can be plainer than tho&s;e Texts which require it: By which plain and ignorant people may know their duty as well as the learned and wi&s;e. 'Twou'd have been incon&s;i&s;tent with the goodne&s;s of God to re|quire obedience on the greate&s;t penalties, and yet leave it &s;o un|certain, as the <HI>Jacobiti&s;h</HI> princi|ples wou'd render it, to whom o|bedience is to be paid. What can be more uncertain than ge|nerally titles are? And are there not innumerable intricate diffi|culties, about long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, pre&s;um'd con&s;ent, a ju&s;t cau&s;e for a total conque&s;t? &amp;c. If about the&s;e points the learned &s;o ex|tremely differ, as any one may perceive who examines what au|thors have writ upon it, who give good rea&s;ons for de&s;troying one another's hypothe&s;is, but none for confirming their own, which are not liable to equal excepti|ons; What means or po&s;&s;ibility have almo&s;t all mankind, the unlearned and common people, of knowing their duty?</P>
<P>The primitive chri&s;tians all a|long comply'd with the revoluti|ons of the empire; and whoever was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, without examining his title, they paid him allegiance, and thought him inve&s;ted with God's authority: And as the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandals,</HI> and other barbarous nations on the one hand, and the <HI>Saracens, Turks</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> on the other, without any ju&s;t cau&s;e, overturn'd the <HI>Roman</HI> empire; the chri&s;tians were &s;o far from di&s;puting their titles, or refu&s;ing to transfer their allegiance to 'em, that they never &s;crupled to own their go|vernment. If the&s;e Phari&s;aical notions had been then believ'd or practis'd, tho&s;e nations wou'd have extirpated all the profe&s;&s;ors of chri&s;tianity as enemies to go|vernment and order, in&s;tead of being converted to their religion, as mo&s;t of the northern nations were. Nor do the chri&s;tians who now live under the dominions of the infidels vary from this primi|tive practice, or &s;cruple to trans|fer their allegiance to any who gets po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;acred office of governing, though the legal prince be &s;till alive. Did not the
<PB N="40" REF="015843_0041_0F9A2CAE8FB4A910"><HI>Jews,</HI> tho' commanded by a di|vine law to take a king from a|mong their brethren, and God him&s;elf had intail'd the crown on the po&s;terity of <HI>David,</HI> practi&s;e the &s;ame as they fell under the power of the four great empires? And did they not &s;ubmit to <HI>A|lexander,</HI> without endeavouring to oppo&s;e him, when <HI>Darius,</HI> to whom they had &s;worn obedience, cou'd no longer protect 'em?</P>
<P>I &s;hall add only one in&s;tance more, and that &s;hall be of <HI>Da|vid,</HI> who thought it not unlaw|ful, when <HI>Saul</HI> de&s;ign'd to take away his life, to trans&s;er his al|legiance, and fly to <HI>Achi&s;h,</HI> king of <HI>Gath,</HI> for protection, who made him keeper of his head, or captain of his guard: and whil&s;t he was under his protection, he thought it his duty to pay all manner of allegiance to him; and (tho' contrary to his intere&s;t, and the hopes he had of being king after <HI>Saul's</HI> death) even to join with the uncircumcis'd to invade his own country, and fight again&s;t the <HI>Lord's anointed,</HI> his late king and father-in-law; and, as appears by 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 29, 8, he was much g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iev'd, and hum|bly expo&s;tulates with the king for not permitting him to attend him in the battle: <HI>But what have I done? or what ha&s;t thou found in thy &s;ervant, &s;o long as I have been with thee until this day, that I may not go and fight again&s;t the e|nemies of my Lord the King? Saul</HI> by de&s;igning to de&s;troy <HI>David,</HI> had freed him from the allegiance he ow'd him: for he who de&s;igns to de&s;troy a per&s;on, can't have a mind to govern that per&s;on; and if he will not govern him, he is free from his government, and at liberty to pay his allegiance where he thinks be&s;t. And if <HI>David</HI> expected from the king of <HI>Gath</HI> a univer&s;al protection from all his enemies, he ought to pay the king a univer&s;al obedience.</P>
<P>If a private per&s;on be freed from the government which de|&s;igns to de&s;troy him, the argu|ment will hold as &s;trong in be|half of a nation de&s;ign'd to be de|&s;troy'd; and whoever attempts it, not only renounces the govern|ment of the nation, but puts him&s;elf in a &s;tate of war, and de|clares he is an utter enemy to 'em, who are as much oblig'd to re&s;i&s;t him, as they are any other enemy.</P>
<P>Upon this head the <HI>Jews,</HI> in the time of the <HI>Maccabees,</HI> took up a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ms again&s;t their legal king <HI>Antiochus</HI> (whom they all along acknowledg'd as &s;uch, and who was &s;ucce&s;&s;or to <HI>Alexander,</HI> who had the &s;ame right to their obe|dience as the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> or <HI>A&s;&s;yrians</HI> had) who was re&s;olv'd to extir|pate'em if they wou'd not turn idolaters. And'tis manife&s;t that God, by the miraculous a&s;&s;i&s;tance he gave'em (for what they did mu&s;t be imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ted to more than human force) did approve of their de&s;ign. And the &s;ame rea&s;ons will ju&s;tify any nation for oppo&s;|ing that prince who endeavours, upon a religious or any other ac|count, to de&s;troy'em.</P>
<P>By what has been &s;aid I hope'tis plain, that by the po&s;itive law of God, by the law of right rea&s;on, by the law of nations, the univer&s;al practice of mankind, and the expre&s;s law of the land, obedience is due to that power who actually governs the peo|ple: which right I think has been &s;ufficiently demon&s;trated by tho&s;e who have writ on that &s;ubject, at
<PB N="41" REF="015843_0042_0F9A2CAF4FBC8C98">lea&s;t to lawyers, and men who are competent judges in &s;uch points; of which a great many can judge no better, than of ma|thematical demon&s;trations, which are neverthele&s;s demon&s;trations. But none can be mi&s;taken who they are that actually govern the nation; and if obedience for that rea&s;on be due to 'em, other in|quiries are needle&s;s.</P>
<P>To conclude, I hope I have demon&s;trated, That 'tis the duty of all people to bear true faith and allegiance to the pre&s;ent govern|ment, by rea&s;ons and arguments which are as firm as government it&s;elf, and which will endure as long as that, becau&s;e built upon the &s;ame foundation, <HI>The good of &s;ocieties;</HI> and which may &s;erve for directions in all changes and revolutions, as well as for the ju&s;tification of that happy one, which (by the ble&s;&s;ing of God on his Maje&s;ty King William's he|roick endeavours) pre&s;erves us in the enjoyment of all our happi|ne&s;s both &s;piritual and temporal.</P>
