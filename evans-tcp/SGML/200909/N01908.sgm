<P>_WHEN the <HI>Eight Mini&s;ters</HI> who at this time carry on the an|cient and famous <HI>Thur&s;day-Lecture</HI> of <HI>BOSTON,</HI> agreed upon Preaching <HI>Eight Ser|mons</HI> on the Nature, and Methods, and Motives, of EARLY PIETY, I did with Satisfaction Look on this their Agreement as a Motion from GOD; And I could <HI>have no Greater Joy,</HI> than to &s;ee <HI>my Children thus Walking in the Truth,</HI> and &s;o zealous to Invite and Per&s;wade the Children of their People, to <HI>Chu&s;e the Way of Truth,</HI> and <HI>Walk with the GOD of their Fathers.</HI></P>
<P>THEY have &s;ollicited a Line or two, from my
<PB N="ii" REF="002256_0001_0FDAC972D7CC3578">Aged and now Shaking, Hand, to Te&s;tify my Sa|tisfaction in what they have done, and I Cheerful|ly give it.</P>
<P>PIETY, or, the Return of a Soul to GOD in His CHRIST, and a <HI>Godly,</HI> and <HI>Sober,</HI> and <HI>Righteous</HI> Life led upon it, is the <HI>whole Duty,</HI> and Intere&s;t, and Wi&s;dom of Man; And the more <HI>Early</HI> the <HI>Piety,</HI> the Greater the Wi&s;dom and Comfort and Glory of them that come into it. <HI>The&s;e are Things that cannot be Spoken a|gain&s;t!</HI></P>
<P>I therefore do Recommend this Book, of <HI>Early Piety,</HI> not only unto the <HI>Young People</HI> in the Country, but al&s;o unto their <HI>Parents;</HI> Advi&s;ing them to Recommend it unto their Families, and make it accompany the <HI>Charges</HI> which they Lay upon their Children, to <HI>know and Serve the GOD of their Fathers.</HI></P>
<P>AS for me, I am now in the <HI>Eighty Third</HI> Year of my Age. And having had in my Mino|rity, an Opportunity to Conver&s;e with the mo&s;t Renowned Servants of GOD, who were the <HI>Fir&s;t Planters</HI> of this Country, and of the Churches in it; and having been for <HI>Sixty Five</HI> Years a Preacher of the Go&s;pel, after my poor manner, in the&s;e Churches; Except &s;ome Years, when I have been favoured of GOD with Opportunities to Serve Him in <HI>Europe,</HI> fir&s;t, when I was a very Young Man, in <HI>Dublin,</HI> in <HI>Gloce&s;ter,</HI> and in <HI>Guer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ey,</HI> before the Year <HI>1662.</HI> and after words, when I was was more than Thir|ty Years ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ab&s;ent from my Charge, for Four Year<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in an A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ency for the Country: I cannot

On which Accounts, it is to be feared, that awful <HI>changes</HI> are further coming on the Country; and that the Holy SON of GOD, offended at the Apo&s;ta&s;y, may order for it, a deep &s;hare in the <HI>Cup of Trembling,</HI> which He is now upon giving to the Sinful Nations. I mu&s;t <HI>Weep,</HI> and I now do it <HI>with a Loud Voice,</HI> for what I &s;ee. <HI>Oh! That my Head were Waters, &amp; my Eyes a Fountain of Tears!</HI></P>
<P>NOTHING will contribute &s;o much, to avert the Evil <HI>Tokens,</HI> at which <HI>they who dwell in the Wilderne&s;s</HI> may be <HI>afraid;</HI> as a Revival of <HI>PIETY,</HI> Even of <HI>EARLY PIETY,</HI> in the Ri|&s;ing Generation.</P>
<P>MY own poor E&s;&s;ays for that purpo&s;e, have been Publi&s;hed, and Repeated, and &s;ome of them <HI>Reprinted</HI> many Years ago. And now, I Ear|ne&s;tly

<P>_O BLESSED and Hopeful CHILDREN, and what Comforts to their <HI>Pa|rents,</HI> that are made Par|takers of &s;uch a <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing!</HI> O Ble&s;&s;ed and Joyful PA|RENTS, that may &s;ee &s;uch a <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> Obtained for their <HI>Children!</HI> EARLY PIETY is the Glo|rious Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. <HI>A PIOUS MIND</HI> is that <HI>Perfect Heart,</HI> which we have in Pro&s;ecution. There is an Un&s;peakable Pa&s;&s;ion in the Souls
<PB N="2" REF="002256_0004_0FDADD3799B65238">of <HI>Parents,</HI> To <HI>&s;ee their Children Happy. Nature</HI> knows not a <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion</HI> more Vehement more En|gaging. I am going to &s;how you, O CHIL|DREN, What will make you <HI>Happy:</HI> I am go|ing to &s;how you, O PARENTS, How you may come to &s;ee them <HI>Happy.</HI> O <HI>&s;et your Hearts unto the&s;e Things;</HI> Your <HI>Life</HI> is in them. Give a Great Attention. <HI>But, O Gra|cious GOD, make Thou a Good Impre&s;&s;ion upon the Hearers of them!</HI></P>
<P>I Remember that on a Coin of the Empe|rour <HI>Con&s;tans,</HI> which we have in our Hands, there is the Emperour drawing a <HI>Youth</HI> after him, and tho&s;e Words about him, <HI>Faelix Tempo|rum Reparatio:</HI> Intimating, That for the Re|forming of the Times, <HI>Youth</HI> is Principally to be dealt withal. Sen&s;ible of This, the mana|gers of your <HI>Lectures,</HI> propo&s;e now a <HI>Sett of Sermons</HI> on EARLY PIETY; Hoping in, and Waiting on Heaven, to give an Efficacy to them.</P>
<P>WE find the Illu&s;trious <HI>David</HI> a little before he died, very Sollicitous about the Welfare of the <HI>Son,</HI> that was to Survive him, and Succeed him; To have the Son, whom his own Eyes, and the Eyes of the People were much upon, <HI>Do worthily</HI> after he &s;hould be Dead.</P>
<P>BEHOLD, Fir&s;t, The <HI>Method</HI> which is ta|ken by a <HI>Father full of Goodne&s;s,</HI> that &s;o he might have an <HI>Happy Son,</HI> and a <HI>Son</HI> that
<PB N="3" REF="002256_0004_0FDADD3799B65238">&s;hould be like him. He <HI>Prays</HI> for the <HI>Son:</HI> He carries him to GOD; he commits him to GOD; he intreats GOD Mercifully to take Notice of him. No <HI>Method</HI> like to This.</P>
<P>BUT then, Behold, Secondly, The <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> to be &s;ought in this <HI>Method;</HI> the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> which alone makes an <HI>Happy Son.</HI> A <HI>Perfect Heart</HI> is that <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing.</HI> A <HI>Perfect Heart</HI> is here de&s;ired for a <HI>Solomon:</HI> A Thing enough to make an Happy <HI>Solomon!</HI> I ob&s;erve by the way an Hebrew Elegancy in the Original. The Name of <HI>Solomon</HI> is derived from that Word that Signifies, <HI>To be Perfect,</HI> as well as to be <HI>Peaceable;</HI> and the very Word that is u&s;ed here. It is, q. d. <Q>Lord, make my <HI>Solo|mon</HI> a Real <HI>Solomon,</HI> give to my <HI>Solomon</HI> the Heart of a <HI>Solomon,</HI> let the <HI>Heart</HI> as well as the <HI>Name</HI> of my <HI>Son,</HI> have that <HI>Perfection,</HI> which will have <HI>Peace</HI> Entail'd upon it.</Q></P>
<P>I am again to tell you, That a <HI>Pious Mind,</HI> is the Thing to be Under&s;tood by a <HI>Perfect Heart.</HI> And this is the DOCTRINE which now very &s;trongly demands a devout Recep|tion with you.</P>
<P><HI>THE PIOUS MIND, of a PERFECT HEART will make Ble&s;&s;ed CHILDREN: And PA|RENTS ought fervently to pour out their Prayer unto the GOD of all Grace, to pour down &s;uch a Ble&s;&s;ing upon their Children.</HI></P>

I.

Children,</HI> It is a <HI>Perfect Heart</HI> that mu&s;t be found in you, if you would not incur the Doom of <HI>cur&s;ed Children.</HI> But I am again, and again, to tell you, that a <HI>Pious Mind</HI> is that <HI>Perfect Heart.</HI> A Principle of PIETY in|fu&s;ed into the <HI>Heart,</HI> is that which will make it a <HI>Perfect Heart.</HI> We do not Expect from you an <HI>ab&s;olute perfection,</HI> which the <HI>heart</HI> of no Man in this World may pretend unto; or an <HI>Heart perfectly,</HI> compleatly, exactly, and in all points Conformed unto the Law of GOD, which no Man in this World has attain'd un|to.

They are undone, <HI>undone;</HI>&mdash;Till this be done for them.</P>
<P>FOURTHLY. The <HI>perfect heart,</HI> which is the ONE THING to be <HI>De&s;ired</HI> for your <HI>Chil|dren,</HI> and what &s;hould be <HI>&s;ought after;</HI> Where is it? Whence comes it?

<P>Fifthly. PRAYER, PRAYER, to the <HI>GOD of all Grace,</HI> is not this the Way to ob|tain the <HI>Gift?</HI> By pouring out your <HI>Prayer</HI> to a Gracious GOD for it, you may obtain of Him. So we are taught, concerning the Ble&s;|&s;ing of a <HI>perfect heart;</HI> Ezek. XXXVI. 27. <HI>I will be enquired of on the behalf of the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, to do it for them.</HI> [It &s;hould be ren|dred &s;o.] When <HI>Parents</HI> do with uncea&s;ing Fervour implore our Good GOD, that He would plea&s;e to do this <HI>Good</HI> unto their <HI>Chil|dren;</HI> To <HI>make them Good, and upright in Heart;</HI> it is a &s;ign, that He will at &s;ome time or other do it for them. Our Good GOD is willing to be&s;tow the Grace of a <HI>Perfect Heart,</HI> when He is asked for it. Nay, there is no Ca&s;e, wherein that Word is oftner fulfill'd, than it
<PB N="18" REF="002256_0012_0FDADD4C8E078998">is in This; <HI>Ask, and it &s;hall be given you.</HI> Not is there any <HI>Prayer</HI> more grateful unto GOD, than This. <HI>Parents,</HI> There is nothing for which you can go to GOD with more of En|couragement and Expectation; <HI>O Do Thou give a perfect Heart unto this Child; The Heart of thy Children; O my GOD.</HI> I can lead you to a Word, worth more than a Rock of Dia|monds, or a Mountain of Gold! It is that Word, Luk. XI. 13. <HI>If you that are Evil, know how to give good Gifts unto your Children, how much more &s;hall your Heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit unto them that ask Him?</HI> What a ravi&s;hing Word is This! <HI>Quicken'd</HI> by it, Oh, Go now to your <HI>Heavenly Father,</HI> not only for your &s;elves, but al&s;o for your Children. With Tears beg it of Him; <HI>O my Father, I long, I long for it, That my Children may be thy Servants. O my SAVIOUR, if Thou will allow of it, the De&s;cent of thy Holy SPIRIT upon them will make them &s;o. O my GOD, Let thy Good SPIRIT lead them into the Land of Rectitude O SPIRIT of Grace, do thou take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them.</HI> 'Tis very certain, That if GOD give His <HI>Holy SPIRIT</HI> unto your <HI>Children,</HI> the <HI>Holy SPIRIT</HI> will give a <HI>perfect heart</HI> unto them. The Holy SPIRIT will <HI>Renew a right Spirit</HI> in them; will <HI>Purify their Heart</HI> by a <HI>Faith</HI> of His Working there; will make them the <HI>Temples</HI> of GOD. The Holy SPIRIT will <HI>write his Laws</HI> in their Heart, and <HI>Rectify</HI> all Di&s;|orders there, &amp; bring all things to rights with in them. Yea, as we Read, That when the Ho|ly

<P>HERE we may Ob&s;erve, that true Saving Graces are in&s;eperably connected together, they all &s;pring from the &s;ame Regenerating, Renewing Change wrought in the Soul; from the Image of God Renewed in, &amp; impre&s;&s;ed on the Heart by the Holy Spirit. Where there's one Saving Grace, there are all Saving Gra|ces.

Again, Ble&s;&s;ed is the Man that <HI>Feareth</HI> the Lord, that <HI>Delighteth</HI> greatly in His Command|ments, P&s;al. 112.1. Therefore <HI>by the Fear of the Lord,</HI> &s;poken of in our Text, we may un|der&s;tand <HI>Univer&s;al Piety,</HI> even all that <HI>Know|ledge, Faith, Repentance, Love, Fear, Hope,</HI> Holy <HI>Obedience,</HI> which the Go&s;pel requires as ne|ce&s;&s;ary in order to our happine&s;s.

<P>Fir&s;t. <HI>WHAT is it to give up your Hearts to God.</HI></P>
<P>NOW to give up your Hearts to God, is to give up your&s;elves to God intirely and for ever thro' Chri&s;t, and with all your Hearts.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IT is to give up</HI> your &s;elves Intirely <HI>to God.</HI></P>
<P>YOU mu&s;t give up <HI>your &s;elves</HI> and all you have <HI>intirely</HI> to Him in your Early Days. You mu&s;t give up your <HI>Bodies</HI> and all its Parts &amp; Members, and e&s;pecially the Tongue to God. You mu&s;t give up all your Sen&s;es to Him: your Strength and Vigour, and your Health and Beauty.

<P>AND in giving up <HI>your &s;elves</HI> to God you mu&s;t al&s;o give up <HI>all you have.</HI> You mu&s;t give up your very Lives and all your Power of Speaking, Tho't and Action.

<P N="2">2. <HI>YOU mu&s;t therefore give up your &s;elves to God</HI> for ever.</P>
<P>GOD will have you for His own for|ever; or not at all. He would have you be in an Eternal Subjection to Him. He would have you be the Eternal active In&s;tru|ments of His Glory and Honour. God would have you yield Eternal Adoration to Him. He would have you to be the Eternal Objects of His Delight and Love: and He would have you to be forever Happy in the Service and Injoyment of Him.</P>
<P>YOU mu&s;t therefore give up your &s;elves and all you have to God, <HI>for ever.</HI> You mu&s;t make &s;uch an ab&s;olute Devotion of your&s;elves to God; as never to have the lea&s;t pretence or right, to free your &s;elves again.

<P N="3">3. <HI>YOU mu&s;t give up your &s;elves to God</HI> in Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>CHILDREN! out of Chri&s;t God wont accept you. God has indeed an unalienable Right and Propriety in you: you mu&s;t needs be His own forever: and He will Eternally u&s;e you for His Glory. But out of Chri&s;t

You are both by Life and Nature mo&s;t abomina|ble and guilty Sinners; and out of Chri&s;t God utterly abhors you and is angry with you; He can't accept, He can't Forgive you, He cannot be Reconciled to you. But in Chri&s;t His Son, our Mediator, and in Chri&s;t alone, God is Reconcileable to &s;uch &s;inful Children, and He is ready to Forgive you and Receive you. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.18, 19.</P>
<P>YOU mu&s;t therefore give your &s;elves to God in Chri&s;t; or He'l ca&s;t you off. You mu&s;t in the fir&s;t place go to Chri&s;t the Son of God and your Mediator. You mu&s;t pre|&s;ent and give your &s;elves to Chri&s;t; that He may give you unto God. You mu&s;t plead with Chri&s;t to Accept and take you for His own: and you mu&s;t not doubt but He'l receive you; &s;ince He was &s;o much di&s;|pleas'd with tho&s;e that hinder'd Children from coming to Him, and &s;aid let them come, <HI>for of &s;uch is the Kingdom of God,</HI> Mar. 10.13,&mdash;16.</P>
<P>CHILDREN, you mu&s;t not therefore Doubt but Chri&s;t will Accept and Ble&s;s you upon your coming and giving up your&s;elves unto Him. And then in Chri&s;t, you may with an holy Confidence give up your &s;elves to God. Chri&s;t will become your Mediator; and in Ble&s;&s;ing you, He'l take away the

<P N="4">4. AND La&s;tly, <HI>YOU mu&s;t thus give your &s;elves to God</HI> with all your Hearts.</P>
<P>THIS Giving up your&s;elves to God mu&s;t not be a meer formal action; but it mu&s;t be an hearty Offering and Devoting of your&s;elves to God. It mu&s;t be Done in the Heart, and from thence it mu&s;t Proceed; or God will not Regard you. Your Hearts mu&s;t be given up to God: Or you are not intire or &s;incere in your Devotion to Him. And if you give up your&s;elves to God, without your Hearts approving and concurring; your Offering is but the Sacrifice of Hypocrites, which is an abomination to Him.</P>
<P>NO! your <HI>Hearts</HI> are the Principal and mo&s;t Peculiar Things which God Regards; and they indeed include and contain all o|thers. The Preacher therefore does not &s;ay the <HI>Hand</HI> or <HI>Head,</HI> but <HI>Heart;</HI> Becau&s;e by the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Heart God has all the mem|bers of the Soul and Body devoted to Him; and without the Heart God values not the Re&s;t. To give to God an Outward &s;how of Piety, is but a mocking of Him, unle&s;s your Hearts go with it. Give your Hearts, and you give Him all: Give Him not your Hearts,
<PB N="12" REF="002256_0072_0FDADDC0CD0A0728">and you really give Him nothing, whatever el&s;e you &s;eem to give Him.</P>
<P>YOU mu&s;t be &s;incere and hearty therefore in your giving up your&s;elves; or you Do not Truly give your&s;elves to God. You only make an Outward &s;how: But God Beholds your &s;ecret Enmity and Aver&s;ion to Him. You mu&s;t not only give up your&s;elves intirely and forever to Him; But you mu&s;t al&s;o do it without Reluctance. You mu&s;t do it freely, and with full con&s;ent of Soul. In Fine, you mu&s;t &s;et your Heart and highe&s;t Love on God: And from your highe&s;t E&s;teem of God and your earne&s;t De&s;ire to Injoy and Serve Him you mu&s;t Give your &s;elves unto Him.</P>
<P>AND thus have I briefly &s;hown you what it is to <HI>give up your Hearts to God:</HI> And this you mu&s;t take care to do in your Youth|ful Age. This is your fir&s;t and great and mo&s;t incumbent Duty. You mu&s;t not allow your&s;elves to Live an Hour, no not a Moment till you have given your&s;elves to God. As &s;oon as you were capable of Knowing Him you &s;hould have given your&s;elves to Him And if you have not done it yet; you mu&s;t do it now, and without the lea&s;t Delay.</P>
<P>AND in order to convince you of this mo&s;t incumbent Duty, we now Proceed more large|ly to Con&s;ider.</P>
<P>Secondly. <HI>WHAT are tho&s;e</HI> Great &amp; Solemn OBLIGATIONS <HI>you are under thus to give your &s;elves to God in your Early Days.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="002256_0072_0FDADDC0CD0A0728">
IT is very likely many of you Think, that this is a matter of very great Indifference. Multitudes among you &s;eem to think &s;o, by your lewd ungodly Lives, and by your light and vain Behaviour in the Hou&s;e of God. You &s;eem to think as if you were not under any <HI>Obligations</HI> to be Religious in your Youthful Age. Or at lea&s;t you think, your <HI>Obligations</HI> are but trifling things, and of little Force and Moment. Many of you &s;eem to be intirely carele&s;s whether you give your Hearts to God or no. You exceedingly neglect Him, and you rather &s;et your &s;elves again&s;t Him: You give up your Hearts to Earthly Things and Plea&s;ures, and to Youth|ful Lu&s;ts and Vanities, and not to God. Alas, you little think what Great and Solemn <HI>Ob|ligations</HI> are lying on you to Devote your Hearts to God in your Early Days!</P>
<P>YOUR <HI>Obligations</HI> are the mo&s;t <HI>Great and Solemn</HI> that can be Tho't of: And if you be'nt Obliged to give your &s;elves to God, you are obliged to nothing. And your <HI>Ob|ligations</HI> are &s;o <HI>exceeding numerous,</HI> that I cannot mention nor conceive them all: nor can I now expre&s;s a thou&s;andth part of tho&s;e I might conceive: For I can Think of Nothing, but it is an <HI>Obligation</HI> on you to be Religious.</P>
<P>EVERY <HI>Attribute</HI> of God is an Obligation on you to give your &s;elves unto Him. Every <HI>Work</HI> of God you &s;ee, pre&s;ents an Obligati|on to you. Every <HI>Mercy</HI> you receive, and every <HI>Affliction</HI> which you meet with; yea
<PB N="14" REF="002256_0073_0FDADDBF42FDCEE0">every Good and every Evil which you hear of in the World. Every Thing contained in the <HI>Word</HI> of God; and every Thing you <HI>Have,</HI> or are able to Do for God is an <HI>Obli|gation</HI> on you to give your &s;elves unto Him.</P>
<P>BUT I mu&s;t confine my &s;elf to a Few.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THERE is</HI> a GOD, <HI>a mo&s;t</HI> Glorious and Sovereign God; <HI>and therefore you are obliged to give your Hearts unto Him in your Early Days.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Argument and Obligation ri&s;es from the Being, Nature and Perfections of God. And I begin with this, becau&s;e it is the Fir&s;t Foundation of all Religion. Now I need not g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> about to prove that there is a God. I believe you are &s;en&s;ible, that this Glorious Sun, &amp; Moon and Stars, &amp; even You your&s;elves could not be made without Him.

<P N="1">1. <HI>HE is</HI> mo&s;t Glorious and Perfect in Him|&s;elf: <HI>and therefore you are Obliged to give your Hearts unto Him in your Early Days.</HI></P>
<P>YOU have learnt already that there is b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> One only True and Living God: and that He is a Spirit of Him&s;elf, and for Him&s;elf <HI>Of Him&s;elf;</HI> i. e.

He is the highe&s;t End, He Lives and Acteth Supream|ly
<PB N="15" REF="002256_0073_0FDADDBF42FDCEE0">for Him&s;elf alone, and in &s;ubordination to Him&s;elf, for other Things.</P>
<P>GOD is ab&s;olutely Perfect: a mo&s;t Pure Spi|rit; without Body, Parts or Pa&s;&s;ions, and Free from all Compo&s;ition. And you have al&s;o Learnt; that He is Infinite, Eternal and Unchangeable in His Being, Wi&s;dom, Power, Holine&s;s, Ju&s;tice, Goodne&s;s and Truth. God is without Beginning, and He can never have an End. He is Immen&s;e and Omnipre|&s;ent. He is always pre&s;ent in every Place; and He always views every Thing Pre&s;ent, Future, Pa&s;t and Po&s;&s;ible. God is Omni&s;cient al&s;o, i. e. He always &s;ees and knows whatever has been, is, and will come to Pa&s;s. Yea, God intirely &s;ees whatever might have been, and whatever can be. He is an All-wi&s;e and All-mighty Being. He is immutably the &s;ame from Everla&s;ting to Everla&s;ting. He is Inde|pendent, Supream and Sovereign, Self-&s;uffici|ent, All-&s;ufficient, and in Him&s;elf alone is Infinitely happy.</P>
<P>SUCH a Glorious Being is &s;urely mo&s;t worthy of our highe&s;t Love and Admiration. If any Thing &s;hould be Lov'd or Admir'd by you for its Excellency or Perfections; &s;urely God mu&s;t be &s;o. Every Divine Per|fection is mo&s;t worthy of your highe&s;t Love, Delight and Wonder; and every Divine Perfection is a great and indi&s;pen&s;ible Obliga|tion on you to give your hearts to God. I might ea&s;ily &s;how how they are, if I had Time to run into particulars. But in general,
<PB N="16" REF="002256_0074_0FDADDC24CA021C8">How highly &s;hould you reverence and fear Him? How profoundly &s;hould you adore and wor&s;hip Him?

<P>OH Vain Youth and Children, How inex|cu&s;able is it that you &s;hould refu&s;e your Hearts to this mo&s;t Glorious and Perfect Be|ing, and give them up to peri&s;hing and em<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> Things and Plea&s;ures!</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>GOD is the</HI> Infinite and Sovereign Foun|tain <HI>of Being, Life and Goodne&s;s: and therefore you are obliged to give your Hearts unto Him in your Early Days.</HI></P>
<P>GOD alone is infinite in all Perfections: He has an infinite &s;ource of Goodne&s;s in Him. He is the only Living and Self-Exi&s;tent Being: and therefore He is the Infinite and Sovereign Fountain of Being, Life and Goodne&s;s unto others. And as God is Infinite in Life and Goodne&s;s; &s;o He is Infinitely, Bountiful and Liberal. He is an Eternal Fountain full and overflowing, and that can never be exhau&s;ted or dimini&s;hed. As God can make you to Live for ever; &s;o He is freely communicative of Eternal Life unto you. He is infinitely exuberant in Goodne&s;s and Happine&s;s: and He is more full and abounding in them to you
<PB N="17" REF="002256_0074_0FDADDC24CA021C8">than the <HI>Sun</HI> it&s;elf in warmth or Light unto the World.</P>
<P>HOW much are you then obliged to give your hearts to Him, who is the only Infinite and Sovereign Fountain of Life and Goodne&s;s. They all depend upon his Sovereign Will and Plea&s;ure, and from him they mu&s;t proceed. To be &s;ure you all de&s;ire to live for ever and be happy: and how incon&s;i&s;tent is it to refu&s;e your hearts to Him from whom alone they flow? But this brings us to the Second Head. viz.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>GOD has</HI> made All Things <HI>for His own</HI> Glory <HI>and He has made</HI> You <HI>to</HI> Glorify and Enjoy Him for ever: <HI>and therefore you are Obliged to give your Hearts to God in your Ear|ly Days.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Argument and Obligation ri&s;es from your Creation and the Ends thereof. And &s;urely this is the mo&s;t inviolable Obligation on you to give your &s;elves to God; from whom you have intirely received your very Life and Being, and that you may thereby an&s;wer the Ends of them.</P>
<P>BUT here are the&s;e <HI>two</HI> Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>GOD has</HI> made you and all other Things: <HI>and therefore you are Obliged to give your Hearts to God in your Early Days.</HI></P>
<P>WE ob&s;erv'd before that God is the Sove|reign Fountain of Life and Being: And now, that He is the actual and univer&s;al Creator. Before He made the World, it intirely de|pended
<PB N="18" REF="002256_0075_0FDADDC3C5615D78">on His Sovereign Will and Plea&s;ure whi|ther or no to bring it into Being. But fir&s;t He will'd it and &s;pake the Word; and then the whole Creation in a moment &s;prang from nothing. He brought this lower World in|to a beautiful Order, and made every Kind of Creature in it in Six Days time. God is the Creator and Former of all things.</P>
<P>AND God having therefore made all Things in the World, He has an ab&s;olute Right &amp; Propri|ety in them. They are the Things of God; And therefore 'tis Ju&s;t and Right they &s;hould be Improved for Him. Youth and Children, you are therefore Gods by Right of Creation: And &s;o are all other Things in the World. Surely then, you are indi&s;pen&s;ably oblig'd to Give your&s;elves and all you have to God, who&s;e Due you are. You mu&s;t be devoted to God, you mu&s;t Live to God, and you mu&s;t improve every Thing for God; or you profanely rob Him of his Right and Due.</P>
<P>BUT then, as the Crown of all his Works in this World below, He made and formed Man. He formed a mo&s;t beauteous Body of the Du&s;t of the Earth, and He breathed into it a Soul, a Spirit Immortal. In every &s;uc|cee&s;&s;ive Age, as the Children of Men have Dy'd, God has wonderfully made and rai&s;ed up others. How devoutly does the P&s;almi&s;t admire His Creator for &s;o Glorious a Work, in <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 139.14 &mdash; 18.</P>

<PB N="47" REF="002256_0089_0FDADDE1774C18F0">you into it, and to take you into His Gracious and Peculiar Care.</P>
<P>AND indeed your Parents have offer'd <HI>No more</HI> to God than what was <HI>His own</HI> Before; Being ju&s;t come out of His Creating and Form|ing Hands, and made to &s;erve and enjoy Him. But God having made you <HI>Their</HI> Children, the Children of His Covenant People, He would have them to offer you to Him; that <HI>You</HI> might al&s;o be bro't into the Covenant with them, and have the Benefits of it.

For God had told <HI>Abraham</HI> the Father of Believers, that the Man Child who receives not the Seal of the Covenant; <HI>That Soul</HI> &s;hould be cut off from His People, having broken His Covenant, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17.14.

<P>AND now, <HI>Children</HI> Con&s;ider, <HI>How Solemnly you were then offered up to God.</HI></P>
<P>DESCENDING of Sinful Parents, you were conceived in Sin, you were born in Ini|quity, and bro't forth in Pollution and Sor|row. You were &s;inful, impure, and loath&s;ome in the eyes of God. You were the <HI>Children of Wrath,</HI> and condemned to <HI>Hell.</HI> You were in a peri&s;hing and helple&s;s E&s;tate: and if you
<PB N="48" REF="002256_0090_0FDADDE289CF5E28">had dy'd in that &s;tate, you had been mi&s;erable for ever. But God then pitied you; and your Parents pitied you, and came and offered you to Him. <HI>Here</HI> they bring their poor crying Infants in Swadling Cloaths, to give them up to God. <HI>Men and Angels</HI> look on and behold the Tran&s;action. Prayers are earne&s;tly made for you by the Publick A&s;&s;embly: And they are the <HI>Eye and Ear-Witne&s;&s;es</HI> of your being Devoted to God. You are openly pre&s;ented to receive the Mark of His Children: And <HI>the Name</HI> of the Great GOD, <HI>Father, Son, &amp; Holy Gho&s;t</HI> is &s;olemnly pronounc'd and put upon you; as a Seal of your being taken into His Holy Covenant, and a Sign that He accepts and challenges you to be His Peculiar Peo|ple. Being offered up by Believers in the Seal of the Covenant, He takes you into His peculiar Care: And thro' the State of your <HI>Infancy,</HI> He &s;ecures your Salvation.</P>
<P>AND now <HI>O Children!</HI> God has graciou&s;ly taken Care of you: He has dealt as a kind Father to you: He has nouri&s;hed and kept you: He has guided and brought you to Years of Choice and Di&s;cretion: He has bro't you to this pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion: He offers you Eter|nal Life and Happine&s;s: He repeats the Offer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> He moves you to Embrace it: And you having injoyed <HI>the Benefits</HI> of His <HI>Gracious Covenant;</HI> He now expects and Requires you to perform <HI>the Duties.</HI> When He receiv'd you into it, He receiv'd you to be His peculiar People, and He then laid you under the &s;olemne&s;t Bonds to be devoted to Him.</P>

<P>THAT which I &s;hall endea|vour at this Time, by the help of God, is to &s;et be|fore our <HI>Young People,</HI> the <HI>peculiar</HI> Benefits and Ad|vantages of <HI>Early</HI> Piety. You have already heard the Duty in the &s;everal great Branches of it <HI>excellently</HI> explained un|to

That therefore which offers it &s;elf next to our Con&s;ideration, is the <HI>Sin|gular</HI> Benefits and Advantages of <HI>Remembering our great Creator in the Days of our Youth:</HI> And as this has fal'n to my Lot, I have made choice of the&s;e Words of <HI>Divine Wi&s;dom,</HI> as an Introduction to the pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e. They are found among <HI>the Proverbs of Solo|mon, the Son of David the King of I&s;rael.</HI> And as the <HI>general</HI> De&s;ign of this book (as was excellently ob&s;erved unto you the la&s;t Lec|ture) was to <HI>form</HI> the Manners of Youth, or to <HI>Teach</HI> them betimes how to <HI>Fear</HI> and <HI>Serve</HI> God aright; in which their highe&s;t Wi&s;dom and Happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts: So I take this to be the more <HI>particular</HI> De&s;ign of the Words now read unto you. This &s;eems to be very evident from the <HI>manner</HI> in which they are deliver|ed. <HI>Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye Chil|dren: &amp;c.</HI> The&s;e Words (as I &s;aid before) are the Words of <HI>Divine Wi&s;dom,</HI> or the Words of JESUS CHRIST, the <HI>E&s;&s;ential</HI> Wi&s;dom of the Father; <HI>in whom are bid all the Trea&s;ures of Wi&s;dom and Knowledge, (Colo&s;.</HI> 2.3.) and they are &s;poken to <HI>Children. Chiefly</HI> to Tho&s;e that are Children in Years, as well as in Un|der&s;tanding. And they contain an <HI>earne&s;t</HI> Ex|hortation to the mo&s;t <HI>important</HI> Duty, back't with the mo&s;t <HI>forceable</HI> Motive that cou'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> tho't of.

<PB N="3" REF="002256_0093_0FDADDEB879D8DF0">Piety that you have been already in&s;tructed in: And to learn them <HI>Now; to day; in&s;tantly;</HI> without making one <HI>Moments</HI> delay in this matter of infinite Concern. And the Singu|lar Encouragement you have unto the Duty, is a mo&s;t gracious Promi&s;e of <HI>Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s</HI> in ca&s;e of Obedience, as in the Words to be in|&s;i&s;ted on &mdash; <HI>For ble&s;&s;ed are they that keep my ways.</HI> The <HI>Original</HI> Word in this place for <HI>ble&s;&s;ed,</HI> is a mo&s;t <HI>comprehen&s;ive</HI> Term; and as <HI>Criticks</HI> ob&s;erve, includes all kind of Hap|pine&s;s in it. Hence the meaning of the&s;e Words is, That all Tho&s;e who <HI>hearken to the voice,</HI> or keep the Commandments of their Great God and Saviour from their Youth up, &s;hall be every way ble&s;&s;ed of Him. They &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed with all <HI>Outward</HI> Ble&s;&s;ings as far as is needful for them; but e&s;pecially <HI>with all &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings, in heavenly places in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> They &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed both in their Souls and in their Bodies.

<P N="1"><PB N="14" REF="002256_0099_0FDADE128AEBBEF0">
1. THE <HI>Early</HI> Convert is ble&s;t with an <HI>Ear|ly Adoption</HI> into the Number of GOD's Chil|dren. Every one that is Renewed and Sanc|tifyed by the Spirit of God, immediately be|comes a Son, a Child of GOD by a mo&s;t <HI>graci|ous</HI> Adoption, John 1.12. <HI>But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the &s;ons of God, even to them that believe on his name.</HI> Hence Tho&s;e that are <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Converted unto God, have the <HI>peculiar</HI> Honour to be <HI>fir&s;t</HI> inve&s;ted with this Privilege. And how great the Dignity and Advantage of this is will appear if we briefly con&s;ider what it is to <HI>become</HI> a Child of God; and what <HI>di&s;tingui&s;h|ing</HI> Privileges &s;uch are Favoured withal.</P>
<P>AND here briefly;</P>
<P>TO become a Child of GOD is to be taken into the <HI>neare&s;t</HI> Relation to God that any Creature is capable of. The mo&s;t <HI>glorious</HI> An|gels in Heaven have no higher Title than to be called <HI>the &s;ons of God.</HI> (Job 38.7.) Nay to be called <HI>the &s;on of God</HI> in an <HI>appropriate</HI> &s;en&s;e: i. e. to be <HI>the only begotten Son of God &mdash; His well beloved Son &mdash; the Son of His Love, &amp;c.</HI> is the mo&s;t <HI>intimate</HI> and <HI>exalted</HI> Relation that the <HI>Second Per&s;on</HI> in the Ever-Ble&s;&s;ed Trinity &s;tands in unto <HI>God the Father.</HI> How amazing then is the infinite Conde&s;cention of the Great God towards &s;uch <HI>&s;inful, polluted</HI> Worms of the Du&s;t as we are, that He &s;hould Advance us to the <HI>Dignity</HI> of Children by a gracious Adoption! It is an Ho|nour done us, that <HI>&s;imply</HI> con&s;idered, is in|finitely
<PB N="15" REF="002256_0099_0FDADE128AEBBEF0">greater than if we had been born of a <HI>David,</HI> of a <HI>Solomon,</HI> or of any of the mo&s;t <HI>Splendid</HI> Monarchs that ever &s;way'd a Scepter in this World.</P>
<P>AGAIN, To become a Child of God is to be <HI>made like unto God.</HI> By a gracious Adop|tion you'l have the <HI>Image of the Heavenly A|dam</HI> livelily <HI>en&s;tampt upon you,</HI> (1 Cor. 15.49.) That Image of His, <HI>which con&s;i&s;teth in righte|ou&s;ne&s;&s; and true holine&s;s,</HI> (Eph. 4.24.) This Image you'l <HI>be changed into from Glory to God, even as by the Spirit of the Lord,</HI> 'till at length you &s;hall <HI>perfectly be transformed into His Like|ne&s;s,</HI> as far as your Nature and Capacity will allow of, (1 Cor. 3.18. 1 John 3.2. compa|red.) And how glorious is the Dignity of this! To bare a Re&s;emblance to <HI>earthly</HI> Ma|je&s;ty makes a <HI>&s;plendid</HI> appearance in the Eye of the World. But <HI>un&s;peakably</HI> more glori|ous in the Eyes of GOD, Angels and good Men is the lea&s;t Saint, <HI>being made a partaker of the Divine Nature,</HI> (2 Pet. 1.4.)</P>
<P>AND then be&s;ides, To become a Child of God, is to be enabled to live <HI>a Life of God</HI> in this world. Tho&s;e that are the Children of God are the <HI>Followers</HI> of their Great God and Saviour; and imitate Him in all His <HI>imitable</HI> Perfections. (See <HI>Eph.</HI> 5.1.) And this is the mo&s;t noble and divine Life that can po&s;|&s;ibly be led by us. For as God is the <HI>Origi|nal</HI> of all Excellency and Perfection; &s;o a Conformity to His ble&s;&s;ed Image and Exam|ple will exceedingly refine our Nature, and
<PB N="16" REF="002256_0100_0FDAC97D58645E98">va&s;tly exalt us above the common Level of Mankind. Thus you &s;ee what it is to be|come a Child of God: And how <HI>honourable</HI> the Relation is.</P>
<P>AND now the <HI>di&s;tingui&s;hing</HI> Privileges of it are no le&s;s <HI>wonderful</HI> and <HI>glorious.</HI> For by being a Child of God, You have His <HI>Fatherly</HI> Compa&s;&s;ions always extended towards you. P&s;al. 103.13. <HI>Like as a Father pitieth his Chil|dren; &s;o does the Lord pity them that fear him.</HI> His <HI>watchful</HI> Eye will ever be upon you, His <HI>tender</HI> Care over you, and His <HI>bountiful</HI> Hand open unto you. And then be&s;ides, You may <HI>repair</HI> unto Him at all Times <HI>as Children to their Father.</HI> You may make Him your Re|fuge in every Time of Trouble: You may o|pen all your wants and Griefs unto Him: You may ca&s;t all your Burdens upon Him: And beg all needful &s;upplies from Him. All this you may do with the Liberty and Free|dom of Children; And be a&s;&s;ured, That His Ear will <HI>ever</HI> be <HI>open</HI> to your Reque&s;ts. For <HI>the Eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his Ears are open to their Cry,</HI> (as in P&s;al. 34.15.) And to the&s;e I &s;hall add, By virtue of your Adoption you'l obtain an <HI>unalienable</HI> Right and Title to <HI>the Inheritance of Children &mdash; An heavenly Inheritance &mdash; the Inheri|tance of the Saints in Light.</HI> And that which will be the <HI>crown</HI> and <HI>glory</HI> of all is, you'l be made a <HI>joynt Heir with Chri&s;t</HI> of this Inheri|tance. Rom. 8.16, 17. <HI>The Spirit it &s;elf bar|eth witne&s;s with ours, that we are the Children
<PB N="17" REF="002256_0100_0FDAC97D58645E98">of God. And if Children then Heirs; Heirs of God, and joynt Heirs with Chri&s;t.</HI> The&s;e Things I have but ju&s;t named unto you.

By a <HI>con|&s;tant</HI> levelling at the <HI>Root</HI> of Sin, the <HI>Habits</HI> of it will by degrees grow weaker and weaker in you.

It is truly a Favour of God to any, which they &s;hould think of with Thankfulne&s;s to him, when their Youth has not been &s;tain'd by any &s;candalous Sins. But we mu&s;t not think <HI>this</HI> &s;ufficient; we mu&s;t not &s;top <HI>here;</HI> for meer Morality will never carry any to Heaven. It is not enough for you, <HI>Young Per&s;ons,</HI> that you be blamele&s;s in your outward Carriage and Con|ver&s;ation, but you mu&s;t become really, in|wardly practically religious and godly.

<P>CHRIST therefore, in An&s;wer to his fur|ther Inquiry, <HI>What lack I yet;</HI> tells him what he mu&s;t come up to, if he would approve him&s;elf a <HI>Chri&s;tian indeed</HI> and &s;o make &s;ure of Eternal Life. <HI>Je&s;us &s;aid unto him, if tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> wilt be perfect, go and &s;ell that thou ha&s;t, and give

If Religion would co&s;t him &s;o dear as this came to, he mu&s;t even have done with the Tho'ts of it.

<P>BUT it is now time for me to di&s;mi&s;s the <HI>Text</HI> and <HI>Context,</HI> and to apply my &s;elf to that <HI>&s;ingle Part</HI> a&s;&s;ign'd me in the pre&s;ent

<P N="1">1. RELIGION does not <HI>wholly</HI> debar you of and re&s;train you from the Delights and Plea&s;ures of this Life. I deed you mu&s;t not <HI>make Pro|vi&s;ion for the fle&s;h, to fu fit the Lu&s;ts thereof.</HI> You mu&s;t not give Appetite and Sen&s;e its full Swinge.

Young people may u&s;e the Diverti&s;e|ments and Plea&s;ures of life, &s;uch as are pro|per to their Age, &s;o as they do but keep within the Bounds of Innocence and Modera|tion. Religion is not &s;uch a &s;ower ill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aturd thing as you may imagine it to be. It does not give a <HI>total</HI> Prohibition of earthly Plea|&s;ures, but allows of, yea directs to the &s;ober and moderate U&s;e of them. Eccl. 9.7, 8, 9. <HI>Go thy Way, eat thy Bread with Joy, and drink thy Wine with a merry heart; for God now ac|cepteth thy Works. Let thy Garments be always white; and let thy Head lack no Oinment. Live

U&s;e</HI> this World you may, &s;o you do not <HI>abu&s;e</HI> it. Religion would only direct and lead you to &s;uch a U&s;e and Injoyment of earthly Plea&s;ures and Delights, as may be without Offence to God, and Hurt to your &s;elves.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE Plea&s;ures which Religion requires you to deny your&s;elves in, and abandon; <HI>What are they?</HI> They are <HI>mean</HI> and <HI>ba&s;e</HI> at be&s;t; &s;uited only to the Inferior Part of Man. They have in them more of the Bea&s;t than the Man; and the Bruit Creatures may have a more exqui&s;ite Sen&s;e of them than we have. And what are the&s;e to a rational Soul? To us, whom God hath <HI>taught more than the Bea&s;ts of the Earth; and made wi&s;er than the Fowls of Heaven?</HI> They are <HI>fal&s;e</HI> and <HI>deceitful;</HI> have in them the Shew of Plea&s;ure only, and not the Sub&s;tance, the Appearance and Name rather than the Thing; The Fruition of them does not an&s;wer the Expectation. <HI>Solomon</HI> ran a prodigious length in Sen&s;ualities, in the Pur&s;uit of forbidden Plea&s;ures. He <HI>prov'd his heart with Mirth,</HI> &amp; <HI>gave him&s;elf to know Mad|ne&s;s and Folly; what&s;oever his Eyes de&s;ired he kept not from them, he withheld not his Heart from any Joy.</HI> Well, and what Satisfaction did all this afford him? Why truly none at all. <HI>He &s;aid of Laughter it is mad: and of
<PB N="10" REF="002256_0115_0FDADE142F99FD48">Mirth, what doeth it?</HI> Eccl. 2.2. Again, they are <HI>vani&s;hing</HI> and <HI>peri&s;hing.</HI> The World pa&s;&s;|eth away, and &s;o do the Lu&s;ts thereof. The Plea&s;ures of Sin they are <HI>but for a Sea|&s;on,</HI> and a very &s;hort Sea&s;on too.

But he knoweth not that the Dead are there; and that her guests are in the Depths of Hell.</HI> So then the Plea&s;ures which Religion requires you to abandon, are &s;uch as you have little Rea&s;on to be fond of: However the corrupt heart may find &s;ome Reluctancy in refu&s;ing them, yet (as one apt|ly u&s;es here the Words of <HI>Abigail</HI> to <HI>David</HI> about his denying him&s;elf the Satisfaction of being reveng'd on <HI>Nabal</HI>) <HI>afterwards it &s;hall be no G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ief unto you, nor Offence of heart,</HI> 1 Sam. 25.31.</P>
<P N="3">3.

<PB N="11" REF="002256_0115_0FDADE142F99FD48">There is &s;uch Plea&s;antne&s;s no where el&s;e to be found as in the&s;e Ways. The Delights that are to be met with in the Way of Duty and Religion are &s;uch as the greate&s;t Sen&s;ua|li&s;t cannot boa&s;t of. The Plea&s;ures of Piety do exceed the Plea&s;ures of Sin and Sen&s;e, in the <HI>Subject</HI> of them; the Soul the better and more noble part.

<P>WHAT are the poor &amp; <HI>beggarly</HI> Plea&s;ures of this life, to the Te&s;timony of a good Con&s;cience, Joy in the Holy Gho&s;t, Delight in God, and Communion with Him?

<P>Obj. II. <HI>THE Work of Religion is very hard and difficult;</HI> and I fear that if I make a Trial I &s;hall find it in&s;uperable, and not be able to go thro' with it.</P>
<P>An&s;w. WE would deal plainly and truly with you, and let you know the wor&s;t before-hand, that &s;o you may &s;it down and <HI>count the Co&s;t</HI> before you begin to build, and may &s;o &s;et out as that you may not turn back di&s;cou|rag'd by meeting with what you did not ex|pect: We do therefore acknowledge it to you, that <HI>it is no ea&s;y thing to be a true and thorough Chri&s;tian.</HI> Tho&s;e that are mo&s;t acquainted with practical Religion, and the Power of Godline&s;s, know this. The Chri&s;tan Life is compar'd in Scripture to <HI>running a Race,</HI> to <HI>wre&s;tling,</HI> to <HI>fighting,</HI> and the like; all which imply Difficulty, Oppo&s;ition, Hardne&s;s, and the great Need there is of Skill, Activity, Strength, Re&s;olution and Patience. Religion does not con&s;ult your carnal Ea&s;e, and Plea|&s;ures. There are many laborious Duties for
<PB N="13" REF="002256_0116_0FDADE1585C3A5A0">you to perform, many <HI>Temptations</HI> to re&s;i&s;t, <HI>Corruptions</HI> to mortify, and <HI>Conflicts</HI> to en|dure.

<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">1. IF there is any Truth in Religion, the Dif|ficulty that attends the Practice of it, cannot be allow'd to be a rea&s;onable or &s;ufficient Ob|jection again&s;t it. If there be a God that made you, that has a Right to rule you now and to judge you hereafter. If you have Im|mortal Souls within you, that mu&s;t Live for|ever either in a World of Happine&s;s or in a World of Mi&s;ery. If you are ha&s;tning either to Heaven or Hell; and it is like to fare with you in the other World according as you have Liv'd in this: I &s;ay, if the&s;e things be true which Religion teaches, (as they cer|tainly are, and as you do believe that they are) why then &s;urely <HI>no</HI> Pains can be judg'd too much to take, <HI>no</HI> Difficulties too great to be undergone, in an Affair of <HI>&s;o</HI> high a Concern. Can you think any thing too much
<PB N="14" REF="002256_0117_0FDADE1AE8D22648">for to &s;ave your Souls, to e&s;cape Hell and ob|tain Heaven? Oh what Pains will Men take, what Difficulties will they go through, what Hard&s;hips will they endure in pro&s;ecuting Matters of far le&s;s Concernment; in Affairs that relate only to the Body and the Life that now is? What Trouble will Men be at to get the Riches, or the Honours, or the Plea&s;ures of this World? <HI>Compa&s;&s;ing both Sea and Land</HI> for them. What a Folly then, what a Shame is it for you to make &s;uch an Objecti|on in this Ca&s;e? Wherein, if in any thing at all, <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity is laid upon you,</HI> and <HI>Woe to you</HI> if you do not comply? One would think there is nothing &s;o difficult, but it &s;hould be readi|ly and willingly entred upon and engaged in, if the Salvation of the Soul, and the eternal Welfare of that, be at all concern'd in it.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE Difficulty that attends the Practice of Religion and Godline&s;s can be no &s;ufficient Objection again&s;t it, becau&s;e <HI>The Way of Sin and Wickedne&s;s is attended with as much or more.</HI> It is really &s;o, that there is many times more Self-denial undergone, and Pains taken, in the Service of Sin and Lu&s;t, than the Prac|tice of Religion calls for. Prov. 13.15. <HI>The way of Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors is hard,</HI> Jer. 9.5. <HI>They weary them&s;elves to commit Iniquity.</HI> There is no wor&s;e Slavery than to Live in the Pur|&s;uit of ba&s;e Lu&s;ts. How is the Sinner in the Gratification of them, carried by Vio|lence and Headlong, contrary to the Dictates of his Rea&s;on, and the Checks of Con&s;cience?
<PB N="15" REF="002256_0117_0FDADE1AE8D22648">How is his Time con&s;umed therein, his E&s;tate often wa&s;ted, and his Body enfeebled? How <Q>many Thou&s;ands die Martyrs to their Lu&s;ts, and are burnt with as keen a Fire (tho' not &s;o honourable) as that the <HI>Martyrs</HI> were fry'd in?</Q> Sometimes the very <HI>Contri|vance</HI> of Sin gives &s;ufficient Unea&s;ine&s;s and Trouble; but more e&s;pecially the <HI>Reflection</HI> on it. How does the Sinner &s;tart and recoil at his own Actions when he thinks them over? One of the greate&s;t Troubles in this World is for a Sinner to look within him&s;elf, and re|member what he has done. The Scripture &s;peaks of the Condition of Sinners in this World as full of Unea&s;ine&s;s and Di&s;quiet. I&s;ai. 57.20, 21. <HI>The wicked are like the troubled &s;ea when it cannot re&s;t, who&s;e waters ca&s;t up mire and dirt: There is no peace &s;aith my God unto the wicked.</HI> Such often di&s;&s;emble their Con|dition, <Q>and make an <HI>appearance</HI> of Satis|faction; but God who is acquainted with the &s;ecrets of all hearts, knows what horror rages in their Brea&s;ts.</Q></P>
<P N="3">3. WHATEVER Difficulty attends the Practice of Religion and Godline&s;s, <HI>the Grace of God can enable you thereunto notwith&s;tand|ing.</HI> You are not left to &s;truggle with the difficulties of Religion in your own &s;ingle Strength, but God is ready to afford you His Help and A&s;&s;i&s;tance, <HI>thro' whom &s;trengthning of us we can do all things.</HI> You have not only the Outward Arguments of Religion to encourage you to encounter the difficulties of
<PB N="16" REF="002256_0118_0FDADE1C448D4C68">it, but the Promi&s;e of His Holy Spirit to help and a&s;&s;i&s;t you. Ezek. 11.19. <HI>I will put my &s;pirit within them, and they &s;hall walk in my &s;tatutes, and keep my commandments and do them.</HI> He is ready to do this for all that &s;in|cerely and in good earne&s;t apply them&s;elves to Him. Wherefore in&s;tead of objecting a|gain&s;t, or being di&s;couraged from Religion by rea&s;on of the difficulties that attend the practice of it, you &s;hould only be quicken'd thereby, according to the advice of the <HI>A|po&s;tle,</HI> Heb. 4.16. <HI>to come boldly to the throne of Grace, that you may find grace to help you in time of need.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. THE greate&s;t difficulty will be in your <HI>first &s;etting out</HI> in the Ways of Religion. What in Religion may &s;eem hard at fir&s;t, thro' the Corruption of our Nature, and our former Ac|cu&s;tomedne&s;s to Sin, afterwards U&s;e and Ex|erci&s;e and the Grace of God will make ea&s;y. When once you are well entred in the Service of God, you will find it perfect Freedom; and in a little time you will be able to atte&s;t to the truth of that, 1 Joh. 5.3. <HI>His Com|mandments are not grievous.</HI> Chri&s;t's Yoke, (&s;ays One) grows ea&s;ier and &s;moother, when we have born it upon us; tho' perhaps at the very fir&s;t putting on, the fle&s;h will &s;trive hard to fling it off. I remember to have read in the Life of Mr. <HI>Philip Henry,</HI> that he once in Preaching from tho&s;e words, Mat. 11.30. <HI>My yoke is ea&s;y,</HI> after many things in&s;i&s;ted on to prove the Yoke of Chri&s;t an ea&s;y Yoke,
<PB N="17" REF="002256_0118_0FDADE1C448D4C68">at la&s;t appeal'd to the <HI>Experiences</HI> of all that had any time drawn in that Yoke, and then gave in his own Te&s;timony after this affecting manner. <HI>I,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>will here witne&s;s for one, who through Grace have in &s;ome poor Mea&s;ure been drawing in this Yoke, now above Thirty Years, and I have found it an ea&s;y Yoke, and like my Choice too well to change.</HI></P>
<P>Once more here,</P>
<P N="5">5. THERE is that Sweetne&s;s and Plea&s;ure <HI>accompanying</HI> the Practice of Religion and God|line&s;s, and that glorious Reward <HI>following</HI> it, that far out-weigh all its Troubles and Difficulties. I might here &s;how, if my pre|&s;ent Limits would allow, how that in <HI>all</HI> the &s;everal <HI>Acts, In&s;tances,</HI> and <HI>Duties</HI> of Religion, even tho&s;e that &s;eem the <HI>hard Le&s;&s;ons of Chri&s;ti|anity,</HI> there is a Sweetne&s;s and Plea&s;ure to be found, not only to &s;upport but delight the Soul. Her Ways are Ways of Plea&s;antne&s;s, and <HI>all</HI> her Paths are Peace.</P>
<P>AND then, what a <HI>ble&s;&s;ed Hope</HI> is &s;et before you in the end to invite &amp; animate you? All the Diffi|culties of Religion will be abundantly compen|&s;ated by a glorious Recompence of Reward in the next World. Religion propo&s;es &s;o great a Reward to you, as that if you &s;hould &s;pend your whole Life in Labour and Toil for it, it would be worth the while. It is the mo&s;t noble that Mans Nature is capable of; &s;et forth to us in Scripture by many cho&s;en Com|pari&s;ons, as particularly by a royal <HI>Throne,</HI> a glorious <HI>Kingdom,</HI> and a glittering <HI>Crown.</HI>

<P>O think on the Guilt, Pollution, and Mi&s;e|ry of your natural State. Think on the Evil of Sin in its Nature and Con&s;equences.

Think on the infallible Know|lege, infinite Purity, and inflexible Truth, al|mighty Power and exact Righteou&s;ne&s;s of that GOD, whom you have provoked by your Sins. Think on the Rea&s;onablene&s;s and Per|fection of His Precepts, the Dreadfulne&s;s of the Threatnings and Greatne&s;s of the Promi|&s;es annext thereunto. Think on your ab&s;o|lute Inability to fulfil the Law, to expiate for Sin, or endure the Cur&s;e. Think on the ble&s;|&s;ed Provi&s;ion, made for you in JESUS CHRIST. Think on the Greatne&s;s of the Salvation pur|cha&s;ed by CHRIST, and propo&s;ed in the Go&s;|pel; the Freene&s;s and Grace of the Offer; the Conde&s;cention of the Terms; and the A&s;&s;i&s;tance tender'd you. Think how much it
<PB N="25" REF="002256_0138_0FDADE519009CDF0">co&s;t the Son of GOD, even His own mo&s;t pre|cious Blood, to procure this Redemption for you.

<P>THESE are &s;ome of the Things, which you &s;hould meditate upon, and a due Con&s;idera|tion whereof wou'd have a rational Tendency to impre&s;s your hard Heart and awaken you out of your &s;leepy In&s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>O Sinner, I be&s;eech you then, Think on the&s;e Things &s;adly in the fear of GOD. <HI>Set your Heart unto all the&s;e Things, give thy &s;elf wholly to them.</HI> Let your Meditations be vo|luntary and cho&s;en, free and uncon&s;train'd.

<P N="1">(1.) WITH a view to this End, Diligently <HI>read the Holy Scriptures, and other pious Books.</HI> Don't mi&s;pend your Time and endanger your Soul by conver&s;ing with idle, leud, prophane Authors; which tends only to exalt Folly and alienate you more from the Life of God. But read Religious Compo&s;ures; Books of Devotion, practical Sermons, pious Lives, &amp;c. particularly <HI>&s;uch as are mo&s;t &s;uited to the

<P>MORE e&s;pecially be conver&s;ant with the ble&s;&s;ed BIBLE. Give your &s;elf to reading in the Law of the Lord, which is perfect, con|verting the Soul, making wi&s;e the &s;imple. Read your Bible frequently; Look into it Day &amp; Night; and that with a reachable and obedient Spirit: with attentive Con&s;ide|ration: with firm Belief: and a wi&s;e Appli|cation of what you read, to your own Soul, by way of Trial &amp; of Charge.&mdash; Ob&s;erve the&s;e Directions in Reading your Bible; and this will probably be a &s;ucce&s;sful Means of your Awakening. The Apo&s;tle tells <HI>Timothy,</HI> who from a <HI>Child had known the Holy Scriptures,</HI> that they are <HI>profitable for Doctrine, for Con|viction, for Correction; and able to make men wi&s;e to Salvation,</HI> (2 Tim. 3.15, 16.)</P>
<P N="2">(2.) ATTEND on the <HI>Publick Mini&s;try of the Word.</HI> The common <HI>Catechi&s;m</HI> (that ex|cellent Form of &s;ound Words which you will do well to &s;tudy much, and ought to hold fa&s;t in Faith and Love; This, I &s;ay,) teaches you, <Q>that the SPIRIT of GOD maketh the Read|ing, but <HI>e&s;pecially the Preaching,</HI> of the Word an effectual means of Convincing and Converting Sinners.</Q>&mdash;The Truth of which Doctrine has been (thro' the Riches of Divine Grace) confirmed in innumerable In&s;tances.&mdash; <HI>Attend then on the Word Preached.</HI> Look on the Publick Mini&s;try, as a Divine In&s;titution.
<PB N="29" REF="002256_0140_0FDADE504833E250">Realize the &s;pecial Pre&s;ence of GOD with His faithful Mini&s;ters. Let every one &s;o account of them as of the <HI>Emba&s;&s;adors of Christ,</HI> and <HI>Stewards of the My&s;teries of God:</HI> and when they &s;peak according to the Law and to the Te&s;timony, receive their Me&s;&s;age not as the Word of Man, but as (what it is indeed) the Word of GOD.&mdash;Let me here advi&s;e you, to be <HI>careful</HI> (tho' not too <HI>curious</HI>) in the Choice of the Mini&s;try, you commit your Self to the Conduct of. Beware of an <HI>Ignorant</HI> Mini&s;try; or a Mini&s;try that is merely <HI>Speculative;</HI> or that is <HI>Superficial,</HI> and at be&s;t only throws a few Squibbs at gro&s;&s;er Sins, but &s;eldom (if ever) touches on more hidden &s;piritual Sins; nor attempts to lay open the Mi&s;ery, Guilt and Danger of a Natural &s;tate, and &s;how Sinners their need of CHRIST for Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s &amp; Strength, &amp;c. Chu&s;e not a Mini&s;try of either of the&s;e dangerous Characters. But fix your &s;elf under a Skilful and Orthodox, a Godly and Experienc'd, a Practical Scriptural and Searching Mini&s;try; which preaches JESUS CHRIST, and &s;huns not to declare the whole Coun&s;el of GOD, and &s;tudies to commend it&s;elf to every Man's Con&s;cience in the &s;ight of GOD.</P>
<P>AND having <HI>cho&s;en</HI> well, al&s;o <HI>improve</HI> well. Be &s;wift to hear; and take heed <HI>how</HI> (as well as <HI>whom</HI>) you hear. Attend with Con&s;tancy, Reverence and Diligence, as an humble Lear|ner. Lay a&s;ide all &s;uperfluity of naughtire&s;s: and receive with meekne&s;s the ingraffed Word, which is able to &s;ave your Soul. Receive
<PB N="30" REF="002256_0141_0FDADE531D5B7508">the Truth in the Love of it; Mix the Word with Faith; Hide it in your Heart, and labour to pre&s;s it on Con&s;cience, both in the hearing, and afterwards.</P>
<P>UNDER the Conduct of the&s;e Rules make U&s;e of the Word preach'd, as in&s;trumental of Conviction &amp; Repentance; and it may be 'twill <HI>work effectually</HI> in you; as it did in them, of whom we read, in 1 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 2.13.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) ENDEAVOUR to improve <HI>Awakening Providences</HI> for this End. Thus, Are you un|der Afflictions <HI>your &s;elf?</HI> Labour to get your Heart &s;uitably affected. Don't &s;et God's Judgments at defiance, nor harden your &s;elf again&s;t Di&s;cipline. <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;ometimes ob|&s;erves, that <HI>the Rod gives Wi&s;dom.</HI> And <HI>Elihu</HI> before him; <HI>If they be bound in Fetters, and be holden in cords of Affliction: then he &s;heweth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hem their Work and their Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, that they have exceeded. He openeth al&s;o their Ear unto Di&s;cipline, and commandeth that they return from Iniquity.</HI>&mdash; Afflictions by a natural Effi|cacy tend to &s;often &amp; humble. When GOD's Hand is upon you then, take this Opportuni|ty to pre&s;s after Convictions. In the Day of Adver&s;ity con&s;ider. Hear the Rod, and who hath appointed it. Receive Correction; &s;et in with Providence, and work together with GOD. Thus <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh,</HI> &amp; thus the <HI>Prodigal Son</HI> improved their outward Afflictions to their inward Humiliation &amp; Repentance.</P>
<P>LET me add here; Ob&s;erve, &amp; Study to
<PB N="31" REF="002256_0141_0FDADE531D5B7508">affect your &s;elf with the <HI>Death</HI> of other Young People; and the &s;ad Outcries of the Impeni|tent in their la&s;t Moments. Look on what befalls others, as a Warning &amp; Call from Hea|ven to you, &amp; let it &s;trike an Awe upon you.&mdash; Let the <HI>Sudden</HI> Deaths which you have &s;een or heard of at any Time alarm your Fears and rouze you out of your Security.&mdash; And when it is a Time of <HI>Spreading Mortality,</HI> when Death rides in Triumph in our Streets, <HI>(and GOD only knows how near &s;uch an awful Sea&s;on may be!)</HI> This is a loud Summons to every One; e&s;pecially to <HI>Young People</HI> who are mo&s;t expo&s;ed to Infectious Di&s;ea&s;es; a loud Call (I &s;ay) This is to Us to turn unto Him that &s;miteth. We &s;hould wi&s;ely ob&s;erve, re&s;ent, &amp; improve &s;uch Di&s;pen&s;ations; and &s;tudy to affect our Hearts, that we may trem|ble at the Arm of the LORD &s;tretched out and humble our &s;elves under His mighty Hand. This GOD expects. See <HI>Joel</HI> 2.1, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) ANOTHER good Help to be made U&s;e of, is <HI>religious Company and Conference.</HI> He that walketh with the Wi&s;e &s;hall be wi&s;e: But a Companion of Fools &s;hall be de&s;troy'd.

The Fruit of the Righteous is a Tree of Life; and He that winneth Souls is wi&s;e (<HI>Prov.</HI> 11.30) I have before directed you to de&s;ert (as ruinous) the unnece&s;&s;ary Company of <HI>Vain</HI> Per&s;ons.

Content not your &s;elf with a few bro|ken Petitions, put up when in Company with others, or in your Bed: Nay, but thou, <HI>when thou praye&s;t, enter into thy Clo&s;et, and &s;hut the Door, and pray to thy Father who &s;eeth in &s;ecret.</HI> Make Con&s;cience of doing this, <HI>Morning</HI> and <HI>Evening</HI> at lea&s;t: And endeavour to be fervent in Spirit, &amp; continue in&s;tant in Prayer without cea&s;ing.

GROWTH in pure &amp; practical Religion is the chief Ble&s;&s;ing on this &s;ide the Heavenly Places: This is to grow in conformity to CHRIST, who has left us a perfect Example of Early Piety. This is to be changed into the Image of GOD from Glory to Glory. This is the way to grow in the Favour of GOD; and in the Comforts of the HOLY GHOST; in U&s;efulne&s;s to the World; in Ripe|ne&s;s for Heaven, A&s;&s;urance of Salvation, and a Capacity for more exalted Degrees of fu|ture Bli&s;s and Glory.

<P>AND now <HI>That</HI> is what <HI>GOD demands</HI> and expects from you.

<P><PB N="2" REF="002256_0160_0FDADE7A0B136B30">
THAT <HI>the Sons of Good Men do not always walk in the Good Ways which their Fathers have walked in.</HI></P>
<P>WE &s;hall con&s;ider this DOCTRINE in &s;e|veral <HI>Propo&s;itions.</HI></P>
<P>THE Fir&s;t Propo&s;ition. <HI>All Good Men do walk in the &s;ame way.</HI> It is that which is called the <HI>way of Good Men,</HI> Prov. 2.20. <HI>Walk in the way of good Men, and keep the paths of the righteous.</HI> It is al&s;o called the <HI>Old Way,</HI> and the <HI>way that is holy,</HI> (Jer. 6.16.) It is like|wi&s;e called, <HI>The way Everla&s;ting,</HI> (P&s;al. 139.24.) becau&s;e Good Men have <HI>always walked</HI> in that way; from the beginning of the World Good Men have always cho&s;en to <HI>walk</HI> in that <HI>way; Cho&s;en</HI> that <HI>Way of Truth,</HI> laying the <HI>Judg|ments</HI> of GOD before them.</P>
<P>Particularly Fir&s;t; IT is the <HI>Way of Piety.</HI> They have always like <HI>Samuel Wor&s;hipped God</HI> and Him <HI>only;</HI> and have been careful not to <HI>take the Name of GOD in vain;</HI> and have <HI>Sanctifyed the holy Sabbaths</HI> of GOD: Yea, <HI>Sanctifying the Sabbath</HI> is indeed &s;o great a part of <HI>Piety</HI> that it is put for <HI>all Religion,</HI> (I&s;ai. 58.13.)</P>
<P>Secondly, IT is the <HI>way of Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> They are con&s;cienciou&s;ly careful to ob&s;erve the <HI>Fir&s;t Table</HI> of the <HI>Moral</HI> Law, and the <HI>Second Table</HI> al&s;o. Therefore <HI>Paul</HI> could &s;ay, Acts 24.16. <HI>Herein do I exerci&s;e my &s;elf to have always a Con&s;cience void of effence toward God and toward Men.</HI> Thus it was with <HI>Samuel;</HI> he was <HI>upright,</HI> he could <HI>appeal</HI> to the People as in the 12th. Chapter of this Book; <HI>Have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="3" REF="002256_0160_0FDADE7A0B136B30">wronged any Man?</HI> And they <HI>all</HI> &s;aid, <HI>No, thou ha&s;t wronged no Man.</HI> But then <HI>his Sons,</HI> they were very <HI>unrighteous;</HI> they did run after <HI>Filthy Lucre,</HI> they <HI>took bribes;</HI> they <HI>perverted Judgment;</HI> which was quite contrary to what their Father did.</P>
<P>Thirdly, IT is the Way of <HI>Prayerfulne&s;s.</HI> Thus <HI>Samuel</HI> &s;aid to the People; <HI>God forbid that I &s;hould cea&s;e to pray for you.</HI> Good Men are <HI>Praying</HI> Men. P&s;al. 24.6. <HI>This is the genera|tion of them that &s;eek him.</HI> They that &s;eek the Face of GOD are the <HI>Generation</HI> that belong to Him Yea, there is not one <HI>Godly Man</HI> in all the World but what is a <HI>Praying Man.</HI> P&s;al. 32.6. <HI>For this &s;hall every one that is godly pray unto thee.</HI> As for tho&s;e that are <HI>Prayerle&s;s,</HI> they are mention'd among the <HI>workers of Iniquity,</HI> (P&s;al. 14.4.) If they are Prayerle&s;s they are &s;o to be accounted. Thus we &s;ee in &s;hort, the <HI>Good Ways,</HI> that <HI>Good Men</HI> are forever found walk|ing in; The ways of a <HI>Samuel!</HI></P>
<P>PROP. II. THE <HI>Children</HI> of Godly Men have <HI>peculiar Advantages</HI> to &s;erve the <HI>God of their Fathers,</HI> and walk in the <HI>Good Ways</HI> which their <HI>Fathers</HI> walked in: Divers Advantages which <HI>other Children</HI> in the World have not. As now,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, THEY have the <HI>Scriptures;</HI> they have the <HI>Word of God</HI> to direct them in the way of Life &amp; Salvation. As is &s;aid concerning the <HI>Jews,</HI> Rom. 3.1, 2. <HI>What advantage hath the Jew? much every way; chiefly in that unto them were committed the Oracles of God.</HI> They had the Holy Scriptures. Thus it was &s;aid of
<PB N="4" REF="002256_0161_0FDADE7B8E5AA308"><HI>Timothy:</HI> he was advantaged in that re&s;pect above others, 2 Tim. 3.15. <HI>From a Child thou ha&s;t known the Holy Scriptures which are able to make wi&s;e unto Salvation.</HI> They have al&s;o the Word of God <HI>Preached</HI> unto them; as the <HI>written Word</HI> of God, &s;o the <HI>Go&s;pel Preached</HI> unto them: That is a great Advantage; the <HI>Preaching</HI> of the Go&s;pel is the ordinary means by which true <HI>Faith</HI> in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t is wrought in the Souls of His Elect. Rom. 10.27. <HI>Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</HI> In that regard, the Children of Godly Men have &s;pecial Advantages to <HI>know the God of their Fathers.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly; THEY are the Subjects of <HI>Pa|rental In&s;tructions,</HI> they are taught by their Parents how they ought to &s;erve God. Thus the Lord required his People of Old; <HI>Thou &s;halt teach thy Children diligently my Command|ments,</HI> Deut. 6.7. And in P&s;al. 78.5, 6. it is there &s;aid, <HI>They &s;hould teach their Childdren from one generation to another.</HI> And the Lord &s;aid concerning <HI>Abraham,</HI> Gen. 18.19. <HI>I know Abraham, that he will teach his Children to keep the way of the Lord.</HI> Now they that are the Children of <HI>Abraham</HI> will do the <HI>Works of Abraham.</HI> So we find the Servants of God have always done. <HI>David,</HI> he taught his Son <HI>Solomon</HI> &amp; his other Children. He &s;aid, P&s;al. 34.11. <HI>Come ye Children, hearken unto me, I will teach you the fear of the Lord.</HI> And his Son <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;ays, Prov. 4.3, 4. <HI>I was my fathers &s;on, he taught me.</HI> So did his Godly <HI>Mother</HI> too, &s;he
<PB N="5" REF="002256_0161_0FDADE7B8E5AA308">was careful to In&s;truct him. We read how his Godly Mother In&s;tructed him. Prov. 31.2. <HI>What? my &s;on, and what? the &s;on of my vows?</HI> Said &s;he, I have <HI>Vowed</HI> and <HI>Prayed</HI> to God ma|ny a time for thee, and wilt thou not hear the Coun&s;el of her that has &s;o often <HI>Prayed</HI> for thee and <HI>Vowed</HI> and offer'd many Sacrifices to God on thy behalf?</P>
<P>Thirdly. THE People of GOD, put up many <HI>Prayers</HI> for their Children, that God would give them His Grace; they <HI>Pray</HI> at that rate, 1 Chron. 29.19. <HI>Give unto Solomon my &s;on a perfect heart.</HI> Thus <HI>Abraham</HI> Prayed for <HI>I&s;hma|el,</HI> and God &s;aid, <HI>concerning I&s;hmael I have heard thee.</HI> Their Advantages are Peculiar in that re&s;pect, in that they are <HI>Prayed for.</HI> La&s;tly, They have the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> of their <HI>Parents;</HI> which is not a light thing. The <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> of a <HI>Father</HI> is not to be de&s;pi&s;ed; it ought to be regarded. We &s;ee <HI>E&s;au</HI> as bad as he was, yet when he &s;aw he was deprived of his <HI>Father Ble&s;&s;ing,</HI> be <HI>Wept, and made a great and bitter Cry</HI> upon it. Verily, 'tis a Con&s;iderable, a Valuable Thing for Children to have their pious Parents, im|ploring and pronouncing of <HI>Ble&s;&s;ings</HI> upon them in the Name of the LORD. So that the <HI>Chil|dren</HI> of <HI>Godly Parents</HI> have Advantages which <HI>other Children</HI> in the World are Strangers to.</P>
<P>PROP. III. <HI>MANY</HI> Children of Godly Pa|rents, do prove Godly too, and walk in the <HI>Good Ways</HI> of their Parents; yet it is too often &s;adly otherwi&s;e. Some well Ob&s;erve, God has &s;o ca&s;t the <HI>Line of Election</HI> that for the mo&s;t
<PB N="6" REF="002256_0162_0FDADE8111A4C8E0">part it runs through the Loins of <HI>Godly Parents.</HI> The 2d Epi&s;tle of <HI>John</HI> is, <HI>to the elect lady</HI> and her <HI>Children.</HI> If &s;o be the Mother is <HI>elected</HI> there is more Hope and Encouragement that the Children belong to the <HI>Election</HI> too. We read, P&s;al. 103.17. <HI>The mercy of the Lord is from everla&s;ting to everla&s;ting upon them that fear him, his righteou&s;ne&s;s unto childrens children.</HI> Thus <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays concerning <HI>Timothy,</HI> [2 Tim. 1.5.] <HI>I am per&s;waded</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>that Faith is in thee;</HI> that thou art a true Believer; when I call to Re|membrance the <HI>Faith</HI> that was in thy <HI>Grand-mother Lois,</HI> and thy <HI>Mother Eunice.</HI> Thy <HI>Grand-mother</HI> was a Godly Woman, thy <HI>Mother</HI> an holy Woman; therefore I cannot but Hope the more for thee. Doubtle&s;s, if an account of it were taken, it would be found that the <HI>greate&s;t part</HI> of &s;uch as belong to God have de|&s;cended from <HI>Godly Parents.</HI></P>
<P>PROP. IV. BUT &s;till the Grace of God is <HI>Sovereign.</HI> It is not engaged to any <HI>Parti|cular Family;</HI> He is <HI>free</HI> in the Di&s;po&s;ing of his Grace. He &s;ays, Exod. 33.19. <HI>I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will &s;hew mercy on whom I will &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w mercy.</HI> So that many <HI>Chil|dren</HI> that de&s;cend from Godly Parents are not Godly but much otherwi&s;e, this is a &s;ad Truth. And now, will Fir&s;t, Show the <HI>Proof</HI> of it; then <HI>inquire whence</HI> it comes to pa&s;s. For the <HI>Proof</HI> of it,</P>
<P N="1">1. WE find in the Scripture <HI>Particular Fa|milies,</HI> many of them did degenerate from the Faith of their Forefathers. Let us look back
<PB N="7" REF="002256_0162_0FDADE8111A4C8E0">as far as <HI>Adam</HI>'s Family, and we &s;hall find it &s;o. <HI>Adam</HI> had a Godly Son who&s;e Name was <HI>Seth,</HI> now the Po&s;terity of that Godly Son in proce&s;s of Time did Degenerate and became as the re&s;t of the World, Gen. 6.2. <HI>The &s;ons of God &s;aw the daughters of men.</HI> The <HI>Sons of God,</HI> that is to &s;ay the Po&s;terity of Godly <HI>Seth;</HI> they did Degenerate and became like the re&s;t of the World. <HI>Noah</HI> had a Godly Son, <HI>&s;cil. Shem,</HI> but this Man's Po&s;terity did &s;adly Degene|rate; Notice is taken of it, that they became <HI>Idolaters,</HI> [Jo&s;h. 24.2.] In <HI>Abrahams</HI> Family there was an <HI>I&s;hmael</HI> that would Scoff at his Brother who was a Godly Man. In <HI>I&s;aac</HI>'s Fa|mily was an <HI>E&s;au</HI> who was a prophane Per&s;on.

Is it not &s;aid of <HI>Nabal,</HI> who was a <HI>drunken Sot,</HI> that he was of <HI>the hou&s;e of Caleb?</HI> [1 Sam. 25.3.] A &s;ad thing that &s;o vile a wretch as <HI>Nabal</HI> was &s;hould de&s;cend from &s;uch an hou&s;e as <HI>Calebs</HI> was! <HI>Jo&s;iah</HI> was a Godly Man; yet his Chil|dren <HI>all of them bad!</HI> God &s;aid to one of them, <HI>Did not thy Father do judgment and ju&s;tice!

<P N="2">2. IT is true concerning <HI>whole Generations.</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="002256_0163_0FDADE8248690F98">Sometimes <HI>whole Generations</HI> have Apo&s;tatized from God and become exceeding Sinful in his Sight; So when <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> was Dead it is &s;aid, Judg. 2.10. <HI>There aro&s;e another generation which knew not the Lord, nor the works which he had done.</HI> A <HI>whole Generation</HI> did Degenerate from the Piety of their Fathers that had gone before them. <HI>I planted thee a noble Vine, but how art thou degenerate, &s;aith the Lord?</HI> Jer. 2.25.</P>
<P>BUT now Secondly; <HI>Whence</HI> is it that <HI>god|ly</HI> Men &s;ometimes have very <HI>ungodly Children!</HI> For an&s;wer; Fir&s;t: The Children of godly Men are <HI>born Sinful,</HI> as well as the Children of <HI>other Men.</HI> They have <HI>Original Corruption</HI> in them as much as others have. Hence <HI>Da|vid</HI> &s;ays, P&s;al. 51.5. <HI>I was &s;hapen in iniquity, and in &s;in did my mother conceive me.</HI> Yet <HI>Da|vid</HI>'s Mother was a Singular good Woman; a very holy Woman. <HI>David</HI> when he prayed to God, &s;ays, <HI>Remember the Son of thine hand|maid:</HI> his Father <HI>Je&s;&s;e</HI> al&s;o was a very holy Man; the Jews call him, <HI>Je&s;&s;e the Righteous:</HI> And have &s;uch an Opinion of him, that they Hyperbolically &s;ay, the <HI>Angel of Death</HI> could find no Sin, but that of our <HI>Fir&s;t Parents,</HI> to charge him with. The Son of a <HI>godly Father,</HI> and a <HI>godly Mother,</HI> yet was <HI>conceived</HI> in <HI>Sin and &s;hapen in Iniquity.</HI> Such are as apt to Sin as the Children of ungodly Men; they are apt to <HI>tell lies as &s;con as they are born:</HI> when they commit a Fault they are <HI>apt to tell a Lie,</HI> becau&s;e of the Corruption which is natural to them; yea, they are <HI>Inventers of evil
<PB N="9" REF="002256_0163_0FDADE8248690F98">things,</HI> Rom. 1.30. They are apt to commit &s;uch Sins, as never any did before them. They are apt to do amifs and to fall in with the Ways of Sin.</P>
<P>Secondly. THIS comes to pa&s;s from the Malice of <HI>Satan,</HI> that does what he can to cor|rupt the Churches. Among the <HI>Wheat</HI> there &s;prings up a world of <HI>Tares.</HI> How comes this to pa&s;s? Why &s;ays the Text, <HI>an Enemy has done it.</HI> The <HI>Devil</HI> is that <HI>Enemy;</HI> the <HI>Devil</HI> is an <HI>Enemy</HI> to Purity in Churches; he would have Churches to be like the re&s;t of the World: Therefore he &s;ows <HI>Tares</HI> in the Lord's Field. He does it, in the <HI>Degeneracy</HI> that he Labours to introduce among the <HI>Children of the Covenant.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. IT comes to pa&s;s from the <HI>remo|val</HI> of Eminent Servants of GOD. Thus when <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was going to be taken away, <HI>I know,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>after my Death there will be great</HI> chan|ges among you. Thus <HI>Paul,</HI> when going from <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> &s;ays, <HI>after my Departure there will come grievous wolves among you.</HI> And how of|ten is it &s;aid in the book of <HI>Judges, while the good Judges continued,</HI> things went well, but <HI>when tho&s;e good Judges were dead,</HI> and removed out of the Way, they pre&s;ently Degenerated, and became like the re&s;t of the World; be|came guilty of &s;uch Sins as others in the World were Guilty of. Thus we &s;ee the <HI>Doc|trine</HI> cleared in the Particulars that have been mentioned.</P>

<P N="1">I. HENCE we &s;ee, Men ought not to &s;et their Hearts inordinately upon their <HI>Children.</HI> Indeed they are apt to do &s;o; apt to promi&s;e them&s;elves much comfort in their Children. We &s;ee it in <HI>Abraham,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>Lord, what wilt give one, &s;eeing I go Childle&s;s?</HI> And it is threat|ned as a Judgment, &s;uch a Man &s;hall <HI>die Child|le&s;s.</HI> We &s;ee it in <HI>Rachel, Give me Children or el&s;e I die:</HI> God <HI>gave</HI> her <HI>Children,</HI> and <HI>&s;he died</HI> for it: And when her <HI>Soul was departing,</HI> &s;he called his name <HI>Benoni,</HI> that is, <HI>the Child of my Affliction.</HI> Indeed when the <HI>Children</HI> of the Faithful <HI>die</HI> in their <HI>Infancy,</HI> there is cau&s;e to Hope they are Saved becau&s;e of the <HI>Covenant</HI> of GOD; the Covenant of Grace which they have not Violated.

Wherefore <HI>Pa|rents</HI> who know not how their Children may prove, &s;hould not &s;et their Hearts inordinate|ly upon their <HI>Children. Who knows,</HI> but that <HI>Child</HI> thou art &s;o fond of may prove to thee as <HI>E&s;au</HI> did to <HI>Rebecca</HI> and to his <HI>Father?</HI> He was a <HI>grief of Mind</HI> to them both.

To <HI>make cakes to the queen of heaven;</HI> to Wor&s;hip the <HI>Moon!</HI> yet when <HI>Parents</HI> did &s;o, the <HI>Children</HI> did &s;o too; and no wonder they did. The <HI>Samaritans</HI> that &s;ucceeded tho&s;e that were carried Captive, they Wor&s;hipped graven Images and Served other gods; <HI>as their Fathers did, &s;o did their Children, and their Childrens Children; as did their Fathers &s;o do they unto this Day,</HI> 2 King. 17.41. Tho&s;e Children that did mock the holy Prophet <HI>Eli&s;ha,</HI> that &s;aid, <HI>go up thou bald head; go up thou bald head;</HI> thou &s;aye&s;t thy Ma&s;ter <HI>Elijah</HI> is <HI>gone up</HI> to Heaven; <HI>do thou go after him;</HI> would the&s;e <HI>Children</HI> have done &s;o, if they had not &s;een the Iniquity of their <HI>Fathers?</HI> Doubtle&s;s their Fathers were guilty of the like Iniquity.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>WE may &s;ee by this, it is not in the pow|er of Parents to give Grace to their Children.</HI> They may give them what they have of this World; but that's all. To have <HI>Grace</HI> given to them, it is a thou&s;and times better, far more de&s;ireable than to have a portion of <HI>this Worlds Goods.</HI> But this is more than <HI>they</HI> can Give. They can't give them <HI>Sanctifying Grace;</HI> they can't give them <HI>true Repentance;</HI> that is the <HI>Gift of GOD,</HI> not of their <HI>Parents.</HI> They can't give them <HI>Faith</HI> in JESUS CHRIST; no <HI>that,</HI> none but <HI>GOD</HI> can give. A godly Man can no more make his <HI>Children godly</HI> than he can <HI>Rai&s;e the Dead</HI> out of their Graves: It is none but God can do it: <HI>He</HI> alone mu&s;t have the Prai&s;e and Glory of it.</P>

IV.

<P>WELL, <HI>What &s;hall we do to make &s;ure of This?</HI> A few Solemn Words let me &s;peak to you, and &s;o I leave you.</P>
<P N="1">1.
