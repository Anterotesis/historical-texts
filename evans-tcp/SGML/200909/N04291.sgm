<P>_VERY dear Friends and Brethren! You may remember that the Builders of the Wall of Jeru&s;alem, after the Babylonian Captivity, were obliged becau&s;e of Oppo|&s;ition, to carry a Sword in one Hand to protect, as well as a Trowel in the other to build; and thus mu&s;t Zion's Builders do, now in this Time of Oppo&s;ition, and Temptation. We are told in the Prophecy of <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> Chap. 33. that if the Watchman &s;ees the Sword coming on a Land, blows the Trumpet, and warns the People, however in&s;ucce&s;s|ful his Labours may prove to &s;ome, he will neverthele&s;s de|liver his own Soul: But that if he does not give &s;ea&s;onable Warning, the Blood of tho&s;e that peri&s;h will be required at the Watchman's Hand.</P>
<P>My dear Friends! to prevent unrea&s;onable Prejudice a|gain&s;t this Performance, becau&s;e of my oppo&s;ing &s;ome Per&s;ons in it, who make a fair Shew in the Fle&s;h, I may ob&s;erve and
<PB N="2" REF="005299_0009_1016F6EA8C0D6B30">
a&s;&s;ure you, that Con&s;cience inform'd by the Word of God, con&s;train'd me to do what I have done, in detecting and op|po&s;ing the erronious Notions, of a pernicious new Sect of Peo|ple, called <HI>Moravian Brethren,</HI> or <HI>Hezenhouters,</HI> who have lately come from <HI>Germany</HI> into this Country. Love to God, and his dear and precious Truths, which are &s;ecretly under|min'd by the extraordinary &s;ly concealing Arts of the <HI>Mora|vians,</HI> obliges me to &s;peak out expre&s;ly, in order, as far as it &s;hall plea&s;e the God of Truth to ble&s;s the &s;ame, to give Check to the Spread of that Plague of Lepro&s;y.</P>
<P>I &s;tand here in this De&s;k in the Name of the great and dreadful God, and in the Room of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to &s;ound the Alarm-Trumpet, and give fair Warning to this dear Flock in particular, and to the Inhabitants of the Land in general; by informing and a&s;&s;uring them, that a Spirit of Error and Delu&s;ion is gone forth to deceive the World. <HI>He that hath Ears to hear, let him hear.</HI> I freely venture my Cha|racter, and am ready, God a&s;&s;i&s;ting, to &s;acrifice my Liber|ty, and my Life, in Defence of the ble&s;&s;ed Truths of the Re|formation, and in detecting the Erronious.</P>
<P>If any out of a childi&s;h Credulity, or peevi&s;h Ob&s;tinacy, will not take the Warning given; my Soul &s;hall weep in &s;e|cret Places for their Pride!</P>
<P>I cannot &s;tand as an unconcern'd Spectator, to behold the <HI>Moravian</HI> Tragedy; my Heart bleeds within me to &s;ee the precious Truths of Chri&s;t oppo&s;ed, &s;lighted and trodden un|der Foot, by our new Reformers; and that under a Pretext of extraordinary Sanctity, Love and Meekne&s;s! <HI>My Soul, come not into their Secret; unto their A&s;&s;embly, mine Honour, be thou not united!</HI> It is enough to make a Heart of Iron bleed, to &s;ee <HI>Foxes,</HI> little Foxes, &s;lily creeping into God's Vineyard, and &s;poiling the <HI>Vines,</HI> and tender Grapes, i. e. young Chri&s;tians, with Enthu&s;ia&s;m, Pride, Error, and Non&s;en&s;e!</P>
<P>But I ha&s;ten to con&s;ider the Words of our Text, which is an important Coun&s;el, given by our Lord to the Church of <HI>Sardis,</HI> to reflect upon and call to Mind, the Truths they had formerly heard, as well as the affectionate Di&s;po&s;itions with which they heard them; and that they would u&s;e all proper Means to pre&s;erve and retain them; a Coun&s;el very
<PB N="3" REF="005299_0010_1016F6EC10DC3538">
proper for the perilous Times in which we live. The Di|rection our Lord gave in Re&s;pect of hearing the Word el&s;e|where, &s;trengthens in my Opinion the afore&s;aid Explica|tion; in one Place he &s;ays, <HI>Take heed what ye hear,</HI> and in another, <HI>Take heed how ye hear;</HI> and indeed in the Nature of Things the Manner of doing a Duty, &s;uppo&s;es the Matter without which it cannot exi&s;t.</P>
<P>In di&s;cour&s;ing upon this Subject, I &s;hall endeavour to &s;peak to the following Heads.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. <HI>Shew what Truths we &s;hould more particularly remember and hold fa&s;t.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. <HI>Shew what is &s;uppo&s;ed by and implied in our remember|ing them and holding of them fa&s;t.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>III. <HI>Why we &s;hould remember them and hold them fa&s;t.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>And then improve the whole.</P>
<P N="1">I. One Head of Di&s;cour&s;e, is to &s;how, <HI>What Truths we &s;hould more particularly remember and hold fa&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>To what I would offer under this Head more directly, I would beg Leave to premi&s;e a few Words, concerning the Nature and Kinds of Truth. Here I may ob&s;erve that Truth in it's general Nature, con&s;i&s;ts in Agreement, and is threefold, viz. metaphi&s;ical, logical, and ethical; the fir&s;t is the Agreement between the Appearance of a Thing, and the Thing it&s;elf repre&s;ented by it; the &s;econd con&s;i&s;ts in the Agreement, between the Mind and the Thing it conceives of; i. e. when the Mind conceives of any Thing, really as it is; the third con&s;i&s;ts in an Agreement between our Words and Minds; i. e. when we &s;peak what we think; the fir&s;t Truth is oppo&s;ed to Paint and Varni&s;h, the &s;econd to Error and Fal&s;hood, and the third to Lying; which con&s;i&s;ts in go|ing again&s;t the Mind.</P>
<P>Now my dear Brethren! There are the&s;e Truths follow|ing more e&s;pecially, which ye &s;hould hold fa&s;t to the Death; namely,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Doctrine of CONVICTION by the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> whereby the Sinner is made &s;en&s;ible of his <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Mi&s;ery,</HI> before he obtain <HI>converting Grace;</HI> if we let this precious Truth go with the <HI>Moravians;</HI> or in Compliance to a noted Per&s;on among them, (who a&s;&s;erted in <HI>New-Brun&s;wick,</HI> that
<PB N="4" REF="005299_0011_1016F6ED95E6AC98">
Conviction is not nece&s;&s;ary to Conver&s;ion, but hurtful; and that the Pre&s;byterian Doctrine, re&s;pecting preaching of the Law is fal&s;e) I &s;ay if we drop the Doctrine of Conviction; I &s;ee no Ground of Hope, that ever a &s;ecure World will be alarm'd. And truly tho&s;e &s;uppos'd Conver&s;ions, which are not preceeded by a Work of the Law, are either in general, &s;trong Work|ings of the Fancy and Affections, mov'd in a natural Way, as in Tragedies; or the common Workings of the Spirit as in time Believers, and &s;tony Ground Hearers, or a Delu&s;ion of Satan!</P>
<P>Does not Scripture and Rea&s;on hold forth the afore&s;aid precious Truth; our Lord promis'd the Spirit to convince Men of Sin, of Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Judgment, <HI>John</HI> 16.8, 9. He invites the Weary and Heavy-laden to come to him, and promi&s;es them Re&s;t, upon their &s;o doing, <HI>Mat.</HI> 11.28. He farther informs us, that he came not to call the Righteous, but Sinners to Repentance. That the whole need no Phy&s;i|cian, but the Sick. Was not the Prodigal made to &s;ee fir&s;t that he was peri&s;hing, before he came to his Father? <HI>Luke</HI> 15. Have we not three thou&s;and Examples of this at one View? <HI>Acts</HI> 2.37. I might add the Example of the Jaylor, who &s;aid trembling, <HI>What mu&s;t I do to be &s;aved?</HI> Acts 16. and of <HI>Paul,</HI> who being convinced in his Way to <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> &s;aid, <HI>Lord what would thou have me to do?</HI></P>
<P>Now that the Law is the u&s;ual Mean of Conviction, ap|pears from the&s;e following Places of Scripture, Rom. 8.15. <HI>For ye have not received the Spirit of Bondage again to fear, but the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry Abba Father.</HI> Ob&s;erve here, that the&s;e Gentile Chri&s;tians of the Roman Nation, had the Spirit of Bondage fir&s;t; and whence had they this, by the Preaching of the Go&s;pel? no &s;urely, but of the Law. Hence the Apo&s;tle &s;aith, that by the Law is the Knowledge of Sin, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.20. and that before the Law came he was alive, (i. e. in his own Apprehen&s;ion) but when the Law came, Sin revived and he died, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.9. i. e. when the Law was bro't powerfully home to his Heart by the Holy Gho&s;t, he &s;aw his dead State; this is further confirmed, Gal. 2.19. <HI>For I thro' the Law am dead to the Law, that I might live unto God;</HI> i. e. I thro' the Law, as an In&s;trument apply'd, am dead
<PB N="5" REF="005299_0012_1016F6F05EFD3A40">
to the Law con&s;idered as a Covenant of Works; or dead to all Dependance upon Law-Righteou&s;ne&s;s for Ju&s;tification.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle propo&s;eth this Que&s;tion, Gal. 3.19. <HI>Where|fore then &s;erveth the Law?</HI> he an&s;wereth, <HI>that it was added becau&s;e of Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions;</HI> i. e. it was added as an Appendix to the Covenant of Grace, to convince Men of their Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions. Hence the &s;ame Apo&s;tle &s;aith, Rom. 5.20. <HI>More|over the Law entered that the Offence might abound;</HI> and in|deed the Ca&s;e is really &s;o, the Law as a Sword mu&s;t enter our Con&s;ciences, before Sin will abound in our Apprehen&s;ion &s;en&s;ibly: <HI>Is the Law then again&s;t the Promi&s;e,</HI> (&s;aith the Apo&s;tle, Rom. 3.21.) <HI>God forbid.</HI> No the Law is good, if it be u&s;ed lawfully, if it be preached not as a Covenant of Works for Ju&s;tification; but as a Mean to convince Sinners of their Guilt and Mi&s;ery, their Inability to fulfil it, and &s;o of their ab&s;olute Need of Chri&s;t, and the Mercies of the New Covenant thro' him. And thus in&s;tead of oppo&s;ing Chri&s;t and the Covenant of Grace, it is the mo&s;t effectual Mean of promoting our E&s;teem of and Complyance with both. <HI>The Law was our School-Ma&s;ter to bring us to Chri&s;t, that we might be ju&s;tified by Faith,</HI> Gal. 3.24. And that altho' Believers are now under a milder Di&s;pen&s;ation, of the Go&s;pel, than the Jewi&s;h Church was; being freed from the Yoke of the ceremonial Law entirely, and from the frequent and terrible Inculcations of the moral. Hence is that of the Apo&s;tle, Heb. 12.18. <HI>We are not come to the Mount that might be touched, and that burned with Fire. &mdash; But to Mount Zion the City of the living God.</HI></P>
<P>The Go&s;pel Church being come to her full Age, is treat|ed as &s;uch, and hath more Knowledge of her Priviledges than the Jewi&s;h, who was but in an infant State; yet Unbe|lievers are in the &s;ame Condition now as then. <HI>Mark</HI> 16.16. <HI>John</HI> 3.36.</P>
<P>It would be no Priviledge, but a great Lo&s;s to the Go&s;pel Church, to be depriv'd of this twofold U&s;e of the Law; namely, to convince Sinners &amp; direct Saints. <HI>Do we make void the Law by Faith,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle; <HI>nay we e&s;tabli&s;h the Law.</HI></P>
<P>Rea&s;on it &s;elf will in&s;truct us, that until poor Souls be alarmed out of the deep Sleep of Sin, they are not di&s;po&s;ed
<PB N="6" REF="005299_0013_1016F6F327F510A0">
to value Mercy thro' Chri&s;t much, nor to de&s;ire after it, and labour for it, with due Earne&s;tne&s;s and Importunity: And until they feel a Work of the Law di&s;covering and humbling of them, they are neither di&s;po&s;ed to bow before a &s;over<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> God, nor to give him the Glory of his Grace, both which are nece&s;&s;ary Duties. To talk of u&s;ing the Go&s;pel as the only or principal Mean of the Conviction of Sinners, is very ignorant and fooli&s;h, and &s;hews little Knowledge of divine Things; it's ju&s;t like putting the Plow before the Oxen. To offer a Remedy before the Di&s;ea&s;e and Danger is open|ed, is but to plea&s;e and deceive a wicked World, and make them &s;leep the fa&s;ter in their dangerous Security! Does not the Experience of good Men, confirm this Truth of Convic|tion? Methinks dear Brethren! we &s;hould be willing to part with the la&s;t Drop of Blood out of our Veins, before we part with it, <HI>Remember therefore how thou ha&s;t heard and hold fa&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Ye have heard FAITH explained, as <HI>con&s;i&s;ting (prin|cipally) in our receiving Chri&s;t Je&s;us, in all his Offices,</HI> and <HI>upon his own Terms;</HI> namely, tho&s;e of taking up the Cro&s;s, Self-denial, and following of him, and that with Humility, Deli|beration, Readine&s;s, and Re&s;olution. This the holy Scrip|tures expre&s;ly a&s;&s;ert, <HI>John</HI> 1.12. <HI>Col.</HI> 2.6. <HI>Mat.</HI> 16.24. <HI>Luke</HI> 14.28. <HI>Luke</HI> 19.5. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.12. Hold fa&s;t this pre|cious Truth, my dear Brethren! again&s;t the pernicious Doctrine of the Moravians; who hold that Faith con&s;i&s;ts in a Per&s;wa&s;ion that our Sins are pardoned, and that Chri&s;t died for us; this Notion wants a &s;criptural Foundation, and is contrary to Rea&s;on. A&s;&s;urance is a Fruit of Faith, and therefore it's di&s;tinct from its Nature, and &s;o &s;eparable: The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> ob&s;erves, <HI>Ephe.</HI> 1.13. that the Ephe&s;ian Chri&s;tians were &s;ealed with the Holy Spirit of Promi&s;e, after they believed. Here you may &s;ee that they had Faith before they attained to the comfortable Knowledge of it: The Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> al&s;o &s;peaks to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, 1 John 5.13. <HI>The&s;e Things have I written unto you, that believe on the Name of the Son of God, that ye may know&punc; that ye have eternal Life.</HI> It is al&s;o evident from the Nature of Things, that a Thing mu&s;t be before it be known to be.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="005299_0014_1016F6F7274B7A90">If the E&s;&s;ence of Faith con&s;i&s;ted in the afore&s;aid Per&s;wa|&s;ion, then the Lo&s;s thereof would de&s;troy the very Being of Faith, and &s;o prove a fal&s;e and perver&s;e Doctrine to be true, namely the falling away of the Saints. For we find according to the holy Scriptures, that the Saints of God are expo&s;ed to long De&s;ertions, di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Doubts and Fears, yea to De&s;pair it&s;elf.

Truly if the Old Te&s;tament be rejected, I can &s;ee no &s;ufficient Rea|&s;on, why the New &s;hould be received; for the latter is but a Fulfilment of the former, and a Super&s;tructure built upon that Foundation; and if the Foundation is over&s;et, the whole Fabrick is ruined. But to return,</P>
<P>If the Nature of Faith con&s;i&s;ts in the afore&s;aid Per&s;wa&s;ion, then upon the Suppo&s;ition that univer&s;al Redemption is a fal&s;e Doctrine, (which I &s;hall afterwards prove) and that it is every Man's Duty to believe; it will follow according to this Scheme, that &s;ome are obliged by the Command of God to be|lieve al&s;o, that Chri&s;t has died for them, when the Ca&s;e is not &s;o.</P>
<P>If there be &s;uch a Thing as Pre&s;umption, namely, a believing that our Sins are forgiven, when they are not forgiven, (which I &s;hall afterwards prove) and that this Pre&s;umption is &s;inful, then according to the Moravian Notion of Faith, (which is the &s;ame with the Antinomians) God him&s;elf has obliged natural Men by his own Precept, to commit Iniquity, which is a mon&s;trous Bla&s;phemy! In &s;hort this Antinomian Moravian Faith, looks more like a &s;trong Pre|&s;umption,
<PB N="8" REF="005299_0015_1016F6FB72EF5268">
than the Faith of God's Elect. In the Parable of the Sower, our Lord informs us, that &s;ome Seed fell upon &s;tony Places, and forthwith it &s;prung up, becau&s;e it had no Deepne&s;s of Earth; and in his Explication thereof, he &s;aith, but he that received the Seed into &s;tony Places, the &s;ame is he that heareth the Word, and anon with Joy receiveth it, yet he hath not Root in him&s;elf. (<HI>Mat.</HI> 13.) but the good Ground is &s;aid to bring forth Fruit with Patience. <HI>Luke</HI> 8.15. The poor Man that believ'd in the Go&s;pel, cry'd with Tears, <HI>Lord I believe, help my Unbelief.</HI> Our Saviour re|proved his Di&s;ciples &s;harply for the Weakne&s;s of their Faith, for their Slowne&s;s to believe, Luk. 24.25. <HI>Then he &s;aid unto them, O Fools and &s;low of Heart to believe!</HI> True Faith is certainly oppo&s;ed by our corrupt Nature, and by Satan. Hence we are bid to fight the Fight of Faith, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 6.12. and &s;aid to wre&s;tle with Principalities and Powers, <HI>Eph.</HI> 6.12. True Faith grows from &s;mall Beginnings to greater Strength; hence the Faith of the The&s;&s;alonians is &s;aid to grow exceed|ingly, 2 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 1.3. What then can we rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e that Faith to be, which has no humbling Preparatives, no after Conflicts and Troubles, and con&s;i&s;ts not in a receiving of Chri&s;t, or entire re&s;ting upon him for Salvation? What is it but a &s;orry Mu&s;hroom of a Night's Growth, unworthy of the Name of Faith.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, I will not pretend to limit Omnipo|tency; the great Lord of the Univer&s;e may in his ab&s;olute Sovereignty, po&s;&s;ibly in &s;ome few In&s;tances vouch&s;afe his Grace in an extraordinary Manner; but the general Cour&s;e of his Proceedings, if we believe the Scriptures is agreable to the afore&s;aid Repre&s;entation. Po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome few Per&s;ons have a full A&s;&s;urance at their fir&s;t Clo&s;ure with Chri&s;t; but that this is not general, is evident from what has been already offered.</P>
<P>If it be urged in Favour of the Moravians, That if the afore&s;aid Notion of Faith be a Mi&s;take, it is but what many of great Note, among the fir&s;t Reformers maintain'd.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Suppo&s;ing it were &s;o, it would not alter the Nature of Error, becau&s;e &s;ome good Men were guilty of it. We are to follow the be&s;t of Men, no farther than they follow Chri&s;t;

will it excu&s;e the horrible Crimes of Murder and Adultery, becau&s;e <HI>David</HI> was guilty of them?</P>
<P>But the Truth is, I know of none of the Divines properly call'd reformed, who have maintain'd upon the Moravian Plan, that Faith con&s;i&s;ts in a Per&s;wa&s;ion that Chri&s;t died for us. If any of them have profe&s;&s;ed that A&s;&s;urance was in|cluded in the Nature of Faith, yet it ought to be con&s;idered that they did not at the &s;ame Time hold univer&s;al Redempti|on; which much alters the Ca&s;e, for when a Per&s;on believes that Chri&s;t died for every one, it mu&s;t needs be very ea&s;y and natural to believe, that he died for him; for the Latter is nece&s;&s;arily included in the Former: But it is not &s;o ea&s;y to believe that Chri&s;t died for us upon the Scheme of particular Redemption.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides &s;ome of the reformed Divines who have given into the afore&s;aid Notion of A&s;&s;urance, have di&s;tingui&s;h'd it into different Degrees, and thereby &s;ignify'd that it was not their Opinion, that all who believed had the highe&s;t Degree of A&s;&s;urance, which &s;eems to be the Moravian Notion.</P>
<P>Not to &s;ay that it is more excu&s;able that &s;ome in the Dawn of the Reformation, thro' the Heat of Debate with the Papi&s;ts, (who believe that A&s;&s;urance is not attainable) &s;hould be drawn into another Extream, than that &s;o long after the Light of the Reformation had &s;hone, in its meridian Glory, a new Sect who profe&s;s a &s;ingular Sanctity &s;hould embrace the afore&s;aid pernicious Error; which tends &s;o much to di&s;|tre&s;s many of the poor Saints of God, without ju&s;t Cau&s;e, who ought to be comforted, and &s;o to embarre&s;s their Way to their Father's Kingdom.</P>
<P>If it be again objected, That to &s;ay that A&s;&s;urance is not included in the Nature of Faith, or nece&s;&s;arily annexed to it, is to encourage Pre&s;umers.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No, by no Means! For tho' a Per&s;on may have true Faith, and not know that he hath it, yet he mu&s;t needs know the Actings of his own Soul. Ordinarily he can remember that he has been made &s;en&s;ible of his total Want of Faith, <HI>John</HI> 16.8, 9. his Inability to believe, as well as the Oppo&s;ition made again&s;t his Faith; his affecting Apprehen|&s;ion of Chri&s;t's All-&s;ufficiency and Willin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne&s;s to &s;ave; and

<P>Now if a Per&s;on imagines that he hath Faith, and has not found the afore&s;aid Experiences, he deceiveth him&s;elf. Such Per&s;ons as do re&s;t &s;ecurely upon this Ground, viz. That Per&s;ons may have Faith and not know it, and neither pre&s;s after A&s;&s;urance, nor bewail the Want of it, and are Stran|gers to the Experience of a Work of the Law and Go&s;pel upon their Hearts, are mi&s;erable Hypocrites!</P>
<P>I think that the Command of God to examine our&s;elves, and make our Calling and Election &s;ure, plainly &s;uppo&s;es the Uncertainty of our Knowledge about them, before the U&s;e of the&s;e Means.</P>
<P>My dear Brethren! Let us hold fa&s;t this precious Truth, again&s;t all Oppo&s;ition what&s;oever.</P>
<P N="3">3. Ye have heard, that FAITH <HI>is the</HI> MEANS <HI>of</HI> JUS|TIFICATION, and <HI>of ab&s;olute</HI> NECESSITY <HI>to eternal Salva|tion.</HI> The&s;e Things, the Scriptures of Truth fully a&s;&s;ert, Rom. 3.28. <HI>Therefore we conclude that a Man is ju&s;tified by Faith without the Deeds of the Law;</HI> and Mark 16.16. <HI>He that believeth &s;hall be &s;aved, but he that believeth not &s;hall be damned.</HI> Let us hold fa&s;t the&s;e important Truths, my dear Brethren! again&s;t the perilous and pernicious Doctrines of the Antinomians and Moravians, namely, That tho&s;e who are ju&s;tify'd, are ju&s;tify'd from Eternity in the Sight of God, and actually from the Time of Chri&s;t's Death, and that Faith is not nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation.</P>
<P>Now becau&s;e that <HI>eternal</HI> Ju&s;tification, is the <HI>proton p&s;eudos,</HI> the fir&s;t and fertile Fal&s;hood of all the Antinomian Abomina|tions, the fatal Fountain from which tho&s;e poi&s;onous Streams do flow, which di&s;honour the Religion of Chri&s;t, contradict its grand De&s;ign (which is Holine&s;s,) and &s;ap its very Foun|dations; I think it needful to offer a few Con&s;iderations, to over&s;et this Mon&s;ter of Impiety. And here let me ob&s;erve, that the Doctrine of eternal Ju&s;tification, contradicts the holy
<PB N="11" REF="005299_0018_1016F70291EB5B48">
Scriptures, which inform us that we are ju&s;tify'd by Faith. <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.28.</P>
<P>Now if we are ju&s;tify'd from Eternity, we are ju&s;tify'd before Faith, (for Faith is wrought in the Elect in Time, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.13.) and then mu&s;t not tho&s;e Scriptures, according to this Plan be fal&s;e, which a&s;&s;ert our Ju&s;tification by Faith? For is it po&s;|&s;ible fairly to reconcile a Ju&s;tification from Eternity, and a Ju&s;tification in Time together, a Ju&s;tification before Faith, and after Faith together? I &s;ee not how it can be done, un|til Time and Eternity, before and after, be proved the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The &s;acred Scriptures inform us, that all the Elect as well as others, are by Nature Children of Wrath, under the Cur&s;e of the Law, under the Condemnation of the Go&s;pel, and guilty before God, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.1. <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.10. <HI>John</HI> 3.18, 36. <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.19. Now to &s;ay that tho&s;e were ju&s;tified from Eternity, is to a&s;&s;ert the greate&s;t and mo&s;t irreconcilable Contradictions: it is in Effect to &s;ay, that the Elect are freed entirely from the Guilt of Sin, but are notwith&s;tanding under the full Weight of it; that they are cur&s;ed and ble&s;&s;ed at the &s;ame Time; under Wrath, and Heirs of the Promi&s;e; Chil|dren of God and of the Devil at the &s;ame In&s;tant; condem|ned and ju&s;tified at once. Now can any living Man recon|cile tho&s;e contradictory Propo&s;itions, without overthrowing the Nature of Things, and blending Light with Darkne&s;s? Suppo&s;ing this impo&s;&s;ible Chimera to be true, viz. That a Man &s;hould be in the afore&s;aid contrary States at one Time, and bro't to the Confines of the Grave, where mu&s;t his Soul go at its Exit? not to Heaven, for he is under the Cur&s;e of the Law, the Condemnation of the Go&s;pel; not to Hell! for he is freed from the Guilt of Sin, and has a Title to eter|nal Glory; where mu&s;t it go then, but to the feign'd Purga|tory of the Papi&s;ts? Do not therefore wonder, that &s;ome of the Moravians, and Long-Beards, who are their Brethren (in Re&s;pect of their Spirit and main Principles) &s;hould &s;tumble into the ridiculous Notion of turning Hell it &s;elf into a Purga|tory, by believing that the Torments of the Damned there, are but for a certain Space of Time: However this Notion is &s;o gro&s;s and &s;candalous, that &s;ome of the Moravians are a&s;hamed to own it.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="005299_0019_1016F706F1CA0C48">This Fancy of turning Hell into a Purgatory, is wor&s;e than the Notion of the Papi&s;ts, becau&s;e they believe the Eternity of Hell Torments as to &s;ome. &mdash; It over&s;ets one of the prin|cipal Barriers again&s;t Vice and Incentives to Religion and Vertue, it tends to di&s;band the World, and open the Flood-Gates to all Immorality and Anarchy.</P>
<P>It is vain for the Patrons of the afore&s;aid perilous Figment, to urge in Defence thereof, this Plea, that the original Word for Eternity, &s;ignifies but an Age, or &s;ome Ages, for the &s;ame Word is apply'd to God and to the Happine&s;s of the Ble&s;&s;ed, and therefore they may from hence as ju&s;tly argue, that the Happine&s;s of the Ble&s;&s;ed, yea that the Being of God him&s;elf, &s;hall la&s;t but for a few Ages, which is damnable Bla&s;phemy!

<P>It is notoriou&s;ly derogatory to the Satisfaction of Chri&s;t, and to the infinite Ju&s;tice of God provoked by Sin, to ima|gine that Creatures can make Atonement for it, and &s;o pay the utmo&s;t F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">thing.

But to return from this Digre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The &s;acred Scriptures repre&s;ent Ju&s;tification, as an Act, or Sentence pa&s;&s;ed in Time coming, therefore it cannot be from Eternity; &s;ee Gal. 3.8. <HI>The Scriptures fore&s;eeing that God would ju&s;tify the Heathen thro' Faith, preached be|fore the Go&s;pel unto Abraham.</HI> See, Faith mu&s;t be preach|ed before the Heathens Ju&s;tification, how then could they be ju&s;tified from Eternity, was Faith preached from Eternity?

<P>How irrational and unaccountable it is, to believe that any &s;hould be ju&s;tified from Eternity, will appear, if we con|&s;ider a little the Nature of Ju&s;tification; which is an actual freeing of Per&s;ons from the Guilt of Sin, and giving them a Right to Salvation.</P>
<P>Now how can any be freed from the Guilt of Sin from Eternity, unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e them actually guilty of Sin from Eternity. But how can Creatures act, before they are, or exi&s;t? Every Creature is the Birth of Time, before he is conceiv'd in Time, he is &s;ubject to no Law; and where there is no Law, there is no Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion actual, and where there is no Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion either actual or virtual, there can be no Guilt; for that is an Obligation to endure Puni&s;hment for Sin, thro' the Force and Virtue of the Threatnings annexed to the Breach of the Law; and where there is neither Guilt, nor Sin, nor Puni&s;hment, there can be no Ju&s;tification, which is a Freedom therefrom.</P>
<P>To &s;ay that the Elect are ju&s;tify'd from Eternity, is in Ef|fect to &s;ay, that nothing &s;inn'd from all Eternity, and that nothing was ju&s;tify'd, which is ab&s;urd! for the Elect before they exi&s;t are nothing in Re&s;pect of actual Sin.</P>
<P>If it be objected, that what has been &s;aid will oppo&s;e the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rees of God. I an&s;wer no, by no Means! for the De|cree con&s;iders future Beings and future Actions, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.4. But Ju&s;tification re&s;pects Per&s;ons pre&s;ent or exi&s;ting, and
<PB N="14" REF="005299_0021_1016F70B6CF1FB40">
Actions pa&s;t. It is a real or actual Change of the State, and re&s;pects a Sinner as actually ungodly, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.5. But can that which is not, be really and actually changed? Can a Per|&s;on be ungodly before he is at all in Being? Be&s;ides I &s;ee not how this Difficulty can be removed that lies in the Way of eternal Ju&s;tification, viz. It will &s;uppo&s;e that the Sin of Mankind, and their Ju&s;tification from it, bore an equal Date; both being eternal, for in Eternity there is no before or after. Now this is impo&s;&s;ible in the Nature of Things, that actual Freedom from Sin, &s;hould be parrallel in Duration with Sin it&s;elf, for the latter in the Order of Nature and Time goes before the former.</P>
<P>It is very &s;hocking to con&s;ider, what Di&s;honour this Doc|trine of eternal Ju&s;tification, reflects upon our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and how it &s;aps the very Foundations of his Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>It is a Branch of the Redeemer's Glory, that he has &s;atis|fied divine Ju&s;tice for his People's Sins, and paid their Debts by his Blood and Obedience. <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.13, 14. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.18&mdash;21. <HI>Phil.</HI> 2.8. But according to the Plan of eternal Ju&s;tification, there was no Sin to be &s;atisfied for, no Debt to pay; for can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that a Creature can &s;in before Eternity, or that after he is ju&s;tified from Sin, he is notwith&s;tanding in Debt by it to divine Ju&s;tice? this would be a Ju&s;tification, and no Ju&s;tification! Well, if there be no Debt to pay, Chri&s;t's Satisfaction is de&s;troyed; for it is hereby rendered needle&s;s and u&s;ele&s;s. And thus you &s;ee a Foundation Truth, namely the Satisfaction of Chri&s;t de&s;troyed, by this Antino|mian Moravian Doctrine of eternal Ju&s;tification! <HI>Luther</HI> ju&s;tly ob&s;erved re&s;pecting Ju&s;tification, That it was the Arti|cle of a &s;tanding or falling Church; now when it is judged to be eternal, it is made null and void as has been ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>If the Elect are ju&s;tified from Eternity, then how can our Lord be &s;aid to be their Saviour? &s;eeing that according to this Scheme, they were never liable to De&s;truction. If it be &s;aid, that the Elect were not ju&s;tified till the Time of Chri&s;t's Death, then what became of tho&s;e that died before it? Could tho&s;e be &s;aved who were not ju&s;tified? How un|ju&s;tifiable and uncharitable mu&s;t it be, to condemn to the
<PB N="15" REF="005299_0022_1016F70E36F07BD0">
Flames in Effect, all tho&s;e that died before the Coming of our Saviour?</P>
<P>The Doctrine of eternal Ju&s;tification renders Faith unne|ce&s;&s;ary, (in an ab&s;olute Sen&s;e) for according to that, the Elect are ju&s;tified before it. And by the &s;ame Argument it &s;trikes down the Foundations of Repentance, it repre&s;ents Sin as a meer Trifle, not worthy of our Fear or Sorrow, by &s;ignifi|ing that God is at Peace with tho&s;e that are under its Do|minion! it takes away all Arguments of Terror, by which a &s;ecure World &s;hould be alarmed, and opens deadly Avenues to all Manner of Licenciou&s;ne&s;s; and thus it tears up by the Roots all natural and reveal'd Religion!</P>
<P>If it be objected that Chri&s;t was a publick Per&s;on, and therefore that what he did and &s;uffered, is to be looked upon as done and &s;uffered by tho&s;e he repre&s;ented.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> As none are guilty of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Sin, tho' he was a publick Head of the Covenant of Works, till united to him by a Participation of the &s;ame Nature with him, &s;o none are ju&s;tified by the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t the &s;econd Adam, un|til by Faith they receive it, and are thereby united to him.</P>
<P>It will not avail to &s;ay, that becau&s;e God's Nature and Love are unchangeable, that therefore the Elect were ju&s;ti|fied from Eternity. <HI>A.</HI> It will not follow, tho' God is not changeable, we are, and there is a manife&s;t Difference be|tween God's Purpo&s;es and the Execution of them; the afore|&s;aid Rea&s;oning would conclude the World and all the Crea|tures in it to be made from Eternity, becau&s;e there was a Purpo&s;e concerning their Production from Eternity. But this is fal&s;e, therefore the other is &s;o, which is built upon the &s;ame Plan of Rea&s;oning. As to what the Scriptures &s;ay concerning the everla&s;ting Love of God to his Elect, I think that u&s;ual Di&s;tinction which is ob&s;erved by &s;ound Divines, helps to remove the Difficulty, viz. That there is a Love of Benevolence, and Complacence, the former &s;ignifies the gracious Purpo&s;e of God towards his Elect, and the latter the Delight he takes in them when converted, <HI>Cant.</HI> 2.14. it is only in the former Sen&s;e the Lord is &s;aid to love his Elect before their Conver&s;ion. Be&s;ides it cannot be truly &s;aid of God that there is any proper Pa&s;&s;ion in him. If any by the everla&s;ting
<PB N="16" REF="005299_0023_1016F70FC1E26818">
Love of God to his Elect, imagine that the Guilt of Sin is re|moved from them actually, before they exi&s;t or believe, which is the Point in Que&s;tion, they expre&s;ly contradict both Scripture and Rea&s;on. <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.18. Rea&s;on teaches that (non entis nulla &s;unt accidentia) that which is not, cannot be either ju&s;tified or condemned; where there is no Guilt it cannot be removed.</P>
<P>Not to add that to &s;et forth God's Love, as in every Re|&s;pect the &s;ame to tho&s;e who are under the Dominion of Sin, and to tho&s;e who are freed from it; is to cro&s;s the Current of Scripture, which repre&s;ents the ble&s;&s;ed God as angry with Sinners, and plea&s;ed with his &s;incere Servants thro' his Son.

The&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture, viz. where Chri&s;t is &s;aid to be the Lamb &s;lain from the Foundation of the World; and that God was reconciling the World to him&s;elf, not imputing their Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es to them, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.19. and that Chri&s;t has made Peace thro' the Blood of his Cro&s;s, <HI>Col.</HI> 1.20. and <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.9, 10. and that the Grace of God in Chri&s;t was given us before the World began; can con&s;i&s;tently with the Current of Scripture, the Analogy of Faith, and Dictates of right Rea&s;on, be &s;uppo&s;ed to mean no more than the&s;e Things following, namely, (1) That there was a gracious Purpo&s;e in God from Eternity, to vouch&s;afe Ble&s;&s;ings on his People in Time. (2) That there was a &s;ufficient Foundation laid by the Sufferings and Obedience of Chri&s;t, for the actual Reconciliation of the Elect to God in Time. (3) That there was and is a Sufficiency of Grace trea&s;ured up in Chri&s;t as Mediator, Head of his Church, and Fountain of Influence, to be communicated to the Elect upon their Clo&s;ure with him. Which in &s;ome Places of Scripture is repre&s;ented by the Time pa&s;t, to &s;hew the Certainty of the Event.

<P>If it be again objected, That Things to come are pre&s;ent with God, that one Day is with the Lord as a thou&s;and Years&mdash; therefore the Elect are ju&s;tified from Eternity, in the Sight of God: I deny the Con&s;equence, for by this Way of Rea|&s;oning the World would have been actually made from Eter|nity, in the Sight of God; which is fal&s;e. Jehovah who is all Eye, looks not on Things in a fal&s;e Light. If it be reply'd, that the Elect had a Repre&s;entative from all Eternity, but the World had none, and therefore that the Ca&s;e is different; to an&s;wer this I offer the&s;e two Things, (1.) That accord|ing to the Antinomian Moravian Scheme of eternal Ju&s;tifica|tion, there was no need of a Repre&s;entative at all, there be|ing nothing to pay. And (2.) As to the World, it had all the Repre&s;entative it was capable of, and there was any Ne|ce&s;&s;ity for, namely the Decree of God, that Pattern in the Mount, according to which, this &s;pacious and magnificent Structure was exactly form'd.</P>
<P>Again may we not &s;ay, that Things pa&s;t are pre&s;ent with God, as well as Things to come. And hence may we not argue after the afore&s;aid Manner thus, viz.

<P>Does not the Apo&s;tle pronounce Peace upon tho&s;e, who walk according to this Rule, and has not our Saviour a&s;&s;ured us, that he came not to de&s;troy the Law, but to fulfil it?

It mu&s;t then be exceeding di&s;honourable to the mo&s;t high Jehovah, and wounding to the true Intere&s;ts of his Kingdom, to &s;peak di|minitively of his ble&s;&s;ed Law! <HI>This, this,</HI> over&s;ets the very Foundations of Religion, and rends in Pieces all the Barriers between Virtue and Vice, this leaves us without a Rule of Action, and &s;o expo&s;es us as an ea&s;y Prey to the Wiles of enthu|&s;ia&s;tical Delu&s;ion.

Can a Per&s;on have any Intere&s;t in the Benefits of a conditional Contract, until he complys with the Terms or Condition, upon which a Right to the Benefits is &s;u&s;pended? Although there be no proper Conditions in the Covenant of Grace, yet there are Terms, or Conditions improperly &s;o called, which have a &s;u&s;pending Virtue thus far, viz. that we have no Right to the Ble&s;&s;ings of the new Covenant, till we are enabled to comply with them. Until Faith be formed in us, we are under Condemnation: it is true we have no Power to believe of our &s;elves, neither is there any Merit in any Act of ours, to de&s;erve a Ble&s;&s;ing: But God who is ab|&s;olute Sovereign of the World, and Lord of his own Trea|&s;ures, has been plea&s;ed to con&s;titute this Method, for the Conveyance of his Benefits; which reflects Honour upon his Wi&s;dom. This repre&s;ents the State of Sinners in &s;uch a Dre&s;s of Terror, as has a Tendency to affect and alarm them, and &s;o prepare them for the dear Redeemer. This opens the Aggravations of Sin, and in a Gla&s;s pre&s;ents to our View its malignant Nature and crim&s;on Aggravations, in a &s;trong and affecting Light; which nobly tends to rai&s;e our Indignation again&s;t it: And this points to an unerring Director of our Way, which is worthy of our E&s;teem and Reverence, and mo&s;t con&s;cientious Ob&s;ervance!</P>

Now both the&s;e apply'd to the Deity are bla&s;phemous.</P>
<P>But does not the Scripture repre&s;ent him, to be far from the Shadow of Change? And don't Rea&s;on teach us, that if he changes he mu&s;t change for the better or wor&s;e, or into an equal State to what he was before; but either Way he mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed imperfect, before or after the Change; and &s;o no God: For the Idea of a God e&s;&s;entially includes in it, the highe&s;t Perfection.</P>
<P>How can it be, that Chri&s;t &s;hould die for all, &s;eeing the in&s;eperable Con&s;equences and Benefits of his Death do not belong to all? our Adver&s;aries them&s;elves being Judges.

<P>_MY dear Brethren! You may remember, that in treating upon this Subject, I propo&s;ed the following Method, namely, 1. <HI>To &s;hew what Truths we &s;hould more particularly remem|ber and hold fa&s;t.</HI> 2. <HI>Shew what is &s;uppo&s;ed by and implied in our remembering them and hold|ing of them fa&s;t.</HI> 3.

<P>In Pur&s;uance of the Method afore&s;aid, I had gone no far|ther in the preceeding Sermon, than the fir&s;t Head of Di&s;|cour&s;e; in treating upon which, the la&s;t Truth which I mentioned, was that of <HI>particular Redemption.</HI> The la&s;t Ob|jection again&s;t the afore&s;aid Truth then ob&s;erved, was that in many Places of Scripture Chri&s;t is &s;aid to <HI>die for all.</HI> In An&s;wer to this Objection, two Particulars were then offered, which I &s;hall not now re&s;un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; but &s;hall proceed to ob&s;erve,</P>

we are told that all Men followed Chri&s;t, whereas it was only &s;ome in <HI>Judea.</HI> We al&s;o read of all the World's being taxed in our Saviour's Time, whereas it was only the Roman Em|pire: Yea the Phra&s;e every Man, is not taken in a univer|&s;al Sen&s;e always.

<P>If it be further objected, that Chri&s;t is frequently &s;aid to have died for the World, <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.29. and for the whole World, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 2.2.</P>
<P>The &s;econd An&s;wer to the preceeding Objection may with &s;ome Alteration be ea&s;ily applied here, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iz.</HI> that by the World we are to under&s;tand whatever is contradi&s;tingui&s;h'd from the Jewi&s;h Church, namely the Gentiles.

And indeed this Doctrine of the Partition Wall's being broken down, was &s;omewhat difficult for the Jewi&s;h Church to receive at fir&s;t, as appears by <HI>Peter</HI>'s Vi&s;ion and Defence, before the Brethren at <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI></P>
<P>Some do object&punc; that Place of Scripture, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.29. that there Chri&s;t is &s;aid to die for them, <HI>that trampled under Foot the Blood of the Covenant, whereby they were &s;anctified, and called it an unholy Thing.</HI></P>

<P>Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI> charges the following Ab&s;urdity upon parti|cular Redemption, <HI>viz.</HI> that it is incon&s;i&s;tent with the Com|mand to believe to the &s;aving of the Soul.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> This Objection is grounded upon a fal&s;e Notion of Faith, as tho' it con&s;i&s;ted in a Belief, that Chri&s;t died for us in particular, which has before been confuted.

Some there be who ima|gine, that the Doctrine of particular Redemption, is incon|&s;i&s;tent with preaching the Go&s;pel; which is called a Door of Hope, a Day of Grace; and that it is a meer mocking of Sinners to offer Salvation to them upon this Plan. I will
<PB N="30" REF="005299_0037_1016F738A408EE08">
beg Leave to offer the Sum of Dr. <HI>Ridgeley</HI>'s An&s;wer, "Here let it be con&s;idered, (&s;aith he) by a Day of Grace,</P>
<Q><P N="1">1. That we don't hereby intend, &s;uch a Di&s;pen&s;ation in which all Men might repent and believe, and &s;o obtain Salvation by their own Power; this would be to a&s;cribe to Man, what is peculiar to God. Nor that God will give &s;pecial Grace to all that &s;it under the Go&s;pel. As for the Hope of the Go&s;pel, we cannot under&s;tand any Thing el&s;e thereby, but that all without Di&s;tinction are commanded and encouraged to wait on God, in his in&s;ti|tuted Means of Grace, with a Peradventure that he will be gracious; this being the ordinary Way in which he works Grace. And if there be any Conviction of Sin, this gives farther Ground of Hope.</P>
<P N="2">2. As to preaching of the Go&s;pel, the Doctrine of particular Redemption, hinders not Chri&s;t's being offered to the Chief of Sinners: and the Proclamation of Grace being made publick, to all without Di&s;tinction. This will appear if we con&s;ider what is done, when Chri&s;t is offered to Sinners, here let it be ob&s;erved.</P>
<P N="1">1. That God has given us no Warrant to enter into his &s;ecret Determinations, re&s;pecting the Event of Things: or to give any Per&s;on Ground to conclude, that they are redeemed, and have a Warrant to apply to them&s;elves the Promi&s;e of Salvation, while in an unconverted E&s;tate.</P>
<P N="2">2. When Chri&s;t is &s;aid to be offered to Sinners, in the Preaching of the Go&s;pel, that which is intended thereby is his being &s;et forth therein, as a mo&s;t de&s;irable Object, and that he will certainly &s;ave all whom he effectually calls, ina&s;much as he has purcha&s;ed Salvation for them.</P>
<P N="3">3. It includes in it an informing of Sinners, that it is their indi&s;pen&s;ible Duty and Intere&s;t to believe in Chri&s;t; and in Order thereto, that they are commanded and en|couraged to wait on him, for that Grace which can ena|ble them thereunto. And as a farther Encouragement to let them know, that there is a certain Connection between Grace and Salvation: So that none who are enabled to come to Chri&s;t by Faith, &s;hall be rejected. This is the Preaching and Hope of the Go&s;pel, which is not in the
<PB N="31" REF="005299_0038_1016F73B67053A30">
lea&s;t incon&s;i&s;tent with particular Redemption.</P></Q>
<P>Thus far he.</P>
<P>As to that Method of preaching the Go&s;pel, which &s;ome modern Enthu&s;ia&s;ts are guilty of; namely u&s;ing Means to cure and comfort, by &s;peaking much of Chri&s;t's Sufferings, and his Love, before they try to convince of Sin, and Dan|ger by the Law; it &s;erves only to amu&s;e the Ignorant and Incon&s;iderate, and to prevent their Conver&s;ion to God, by the natural and childi&s;h Working of their Pa&s;&s;ions, moved by &s;oft Expre&s;&s;ions, which they are apt to depend upon in the Room of it. It is a daubing with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntemper'd Mortar, a &s;etting the Cart before the Oxen, &s;uch a Kind of Preaching by &s;oft Methods of Addre&s;s, may make a Show upon weak Minds, but is never like to do real Good.</P>
<P>To a&s;&s;ert univer&s;al Redemption, and then to tell us, that Faith con&s;i&s;ts in a Belief that Chri&s;t died for us in particular, has as dreadful a Tendency to flatter and plea&s;e a carnal World, to fix them in a mi&s;erable Security, and to delude them to Damnation in Multitude<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, as almo&s;t any Scheme that has ever appeared on the Stage of the World. Every pious Bo&s;om &s;hould beat with burning Indignation again&s;t &s;uch a horrid Scene!</P>
<P>As to the preceeding Objection, concerning the Day of Grace, the Door of Hope, and Offers of Salvation, as tho' they were incon&s;i&s;tent with particular Redemption; I &s;hall beg Leave to offer one Particular more by Way of Retor&s;ion, thus,&mdash; Is there not as great an apparent Incon&s;i&s;tency be|tween the certain Fore-knowledge of God, and tho&s;e Things now mentioned, as in the Ca&s;e of particular Redemption? If the Je&s;uits, Arminians, Remon&s;trants, and Moravians, do not acknowledge God's infinite and certain Fore-know|ledge, do they not in Effect deny his Being, for is not his Being and Knowledge the &s;ame? But if they do own it, let them reconcile it with the Day of Grace, Offers of Mercy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that will &s;ufficiently an&s;wer the afore&s;aid Objection.</P>
<P>I may add to what has been before ob&s;erved, this Particular, <HI>viz.</HI> That many of God's Children know the Fal&s;hood of univer&s;al Redemption, by their own Experience; being at Times made &s;en&s;ible thro' the Operations of God's ble&s;&s;ed
<PB N="32" REF="005299_0039_1016F73CED793088">
Spirit, of the tran&s;cendant Sweetne&s;s of di&s;tingui&s;hing Grace! That which &s;tirs up the Spleen and Rancour of many natural Men, (becau&s;e of their Blindne&s;s, Pride, and Selfi&s;hne&s;s,) <HI>viz.</HI> That God &s;hould chu&s;e &s;ome and pa&s;s by others, tran&s;|ports their Souls with humble Admiration, Love, and Gra|titude; and in this they imitate their deare&s;t Lord, <HI>Mat.</HI> 11.25.

<P>To talk of holding particular Election and univer&s;al Re|demption together, is Non&s;en&s;e and Jargon. To reconcile them is as impo&s;&s;ible, as to make a Rope of Sand. If this be the Moravian Simplicity, to believe Non&s;en&s;e and Con|tradiction, may the good God deliver my Soul from their de|te&s;table My&s;teries. Remember therefore how ye have heard and received, my dear Brethren! and hold fa&s;t this precious and valuable Truth of particular Redemption, again&s;t all fal&s;e Apo&s;tles, and &s;educing Spirits, to the Death.</P>
<P>It is contrary to my intended Brevity, to &s;peak any longer upon this Head; any that would de&s;ire to &s;ee this Subject more fully handled, let them read judicious Dr. <HI>Ridgeley</HI>'s Di&s;cour&s;e upon it, in his late Body of Divinity.</P>

<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> If we take that Place in a Con&s;i&s;tency with tho&s;e before mentioned, (and &s;urely the Scripture is harmonious) it can intend no more than one or both of the&s;e following Particu|lars, namely, (1.)

<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> Sometimes this Word only &s;ignifies Sincerity; thus it is &s;aid of <HI>Job,</HI> that he was a perfect and upright Man: Here by the Figure <HI>Hendiadis,</HI> one Thing is expre&s;&s;ed by two Words. This Kind of Perfection every good Man hath. Sometimes this Word &s;ignifies a Perfection of Degrees, i. e. when all Corruption is entirely rooted out of the Soul, and a Man is advanced to the highe&s;t Degree of Goodne&s;s.

It is in this Sen&s;e that I believe the afore&s;aid Text is to be taken; for while the Apo&s;tle rejects any Pretence to a Perfection of Degrees, he acknow|leges this comparative Perfection, as in the Text before cited.</P>
<P>But are we not commanded to be perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect? and does not this &s;hew that a Perfection of Degrees is attainable in this Life?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> No, it does not; for the Command is not the Mea|&s;ure of our Ability, but of our Duty.

<P>Our in&s;i&s;ting upon the Imperfection of the Saints, in pub|lick Di&s;cour&s;es, in&s;tead of being an Encouragement to Im|piety, is a &s;trong Inducement to Holine&s;s; for it &s;erves to pre&s;erve Hope, which is the Spring of Motion, and Foun|tain of Action, in the Bo&s;oms of gracious Per&s;ons, who are deeply &s;en&s;ible of their Defects. Tho&s;e dear Mourners in Zion, are ready to be di&s;couraged &s;ometimes, becau&s;e of the Sight and Sen&s;e they have of their Corruptions: for this they &s;ometimes reject their State, and &s;ay in them&s;elves, O! can it be po&s;&s;ible that &s;uch Corruption can con&s;i&s;t with the Grace of God? O was there ever on the Earth &s;uch a mon|&s;trous bruiti&s;h Creature as I am! For this their Hands hang down, and their Knees are feeble, for this (or on this Ac|count) they are in the utmo&s;t Agonies, &s;ometimes can hardly &s;wallow their Spittle, and would chu&s;e Strangling and Death rather than Life. Now to preach up Perfection to &s;uch poor humble Souls, who have a View of the &s;piritual Extent of the Law, and e&s;pecially to &s;ignify that Conver&s;ion con&s;i&s;ts therein, this adds Affliction to the Afflicted: This makes tho&s;e &s;orrowful whom God would have made glad: This &s;trengthens Satan's Temptations, whereby he labours to per|&s;wade them that they have no Grace: This di&s;pirits them in Obedience. Whereas the contrary Doctrine builds up their Hope, and &s;o excites their Admiration, their Love, and their Contrition. O it melts their Hearts like Wax, and fills their Souls with Amazement! to think that &s;o great, &s;o holy a God &s;hould take any favourable Notice of &s;uch &s;inful, ungrateful, and back&s;liding Worms as they. <HI>This, this</HI> fires and enflames their Souls with &s;trong Emotions of affectionate Love and Gratitude! O what &s;hall I do for this gracious ble&s;&s;ed God who is &s;o good to me? O the &s;urpri&s;ing Riches, and amazing Glories of his pure, pure Grace! This &s;trengthens the feeble Knees, and &s;ays to tho&s;e of a fearful

Heart, be &s;trong. This endears the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us to their Souls, and makes them &s;ee their ab&s;olute Need of him. And thus, my dear Brethren, it encourages and excites to walk in the Ways of religious Obedience. Therefore let us hold fa&s;t this precious Truth, again&s;t the dete&s;table Doctrine of the Moravians, and other Enthu&s;ia&s;ts, who a&s;&s;ert Perfection.</P>
<P>One of principal Note among the Moravians, &s;pake to this Purpo&s;e in <HI>New-Brun&s;wick,</HI> and two of that Sect, who were in Company with him, a&s;&s;erted that they had been without Sin for &s;everal Years; both which Particulars you may &s;ee in the annexed Appendix. Well then; &s;hall we believe the Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> or not, that they are Liars, and that the Truth is not in them? We think we may &s;afely apply to our&s;elves, what is &s;aid of the Church of <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> Rev. 2.2. <HI>that we have tried them which &s;ay they are Apo&s;tles, and are not, and found them to be Liars.</HI></P>
<P>For my own Part, I mu&s;t declare to the World, that I think the Moravians, at lea&s;t &s;ome of them, are not &s;o candid as to this Point, and many others, as the Generality of other modern Enthu&s;ia&s;ts, who own the Doctrine of Perfection expre&s;ly and openly, while &s;ome of the Moravians labour to hide their Opinion, and tho' they own it in Fact and Reality in other Words, yet &s;ome of them don't like to own it in &s;o many Words expre&s;ly. If they u&s;e this Art, to prevent the Odium, which would ju&s;tly come upon their Sect, by their fal&s;e Doctrine; and to impo&s;e upon the Ignorant and Credu|lous, and &s;o to encrea&s;e their Party, it is exceeding ba&s;e in|deed. If this be their Simplicity, may the good Lord deliver us from it!</P>
<P N="8">8.

<P><HI>Dat veniam Corvis, vexat cen&s;ura columbas;</HI> this Cen&s;ure approves the Ravens and condemns the Doves. According to the afore&s;aid Notion, Men would be converted fir&s;t, and convinced afterwards; which directly contradicts all that has been &s;aid before concerning the Nece&s;&s;ity of a preparatory Law-Work, and is real Non&s;en&s;e.</P>
<P N="9">9. Ye have heard that <HI>the Guilt of</HI> Adam<HI>'s Sin is</HI> IMPUT|ED <HI>to all his Offspring,</HI> Chri&s;t excepted; who&s;e Conception was extraordinary and miraculous, by the Power of the Holy Gho&s;t. Hereby he was freed from the Stain of original Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, which infects all tho&s;e, who are propogated by natural Generation.</P>
<P>Our Lord not de&s;cending from <HI>Adam,</HI> in a natural Way, was not numbered in him; and for this Rea&s;on as well as on the Account of his being God-Man, he did not, and I may &s;ay could not, break the Covenant of Nature. If he had broken the fir&s;t Covenant, he could not have been the Head of the &s;econd.</P>
<P>Our Lord was born, not by Virtue of that primitive Bene|diction. Gen. 1.28. <HI>Grow and multiply:</HI> But by Virtue of that gracious Promi&s;e. Gen. 3.15. <HI>And I will put Enmity between thee and the Woman, and between thy Seed and her Seed, it &s;hall brui&s;e thy Head, and thou &s;hall brui&s;e his Heel.</HI></P>
<P>Now that the Sin of <HI>Adam</HI> in eating the forbidden Fruit, is imputed to his Po&s;terity, is evident from the following Places of Scripture, Rom. 5.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">2, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">4, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, <HI>Wherefore as by one Man Sin entred into the World, and Death by Sin, and &s;o Death pa&s;&s;ed upon all Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for that all have &s;in|ned.

Is there not a plain Difference between Nature and Practice? Rom.

3.19. <HI>What&s;oever the Law &s;ays, it &s;ays to tho&s;e that are under the Law, that every Mouth may be &s;topped, and the whole World become guilty before God.</HI></P>
<P>Now if Jews and Gentiles are by Nature Children of Wrath, and if all the World be under the Law, and guilty before God, while in a State of Nature, then Infants are guilty of original Sin, before they be capable to commit actual; for they have the human Nature, and are a Part of the World: and indeed this appears the more evident, from their Liablene&s;s to Death, which the Apo&s;tle repre&s;ents to be the Wages of Sin, and brought into the World thereby, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.23. <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.12.</P>
<P>The Ground of the Imputation of Adam's Guilt to us, is not &s;o much in the Nature which we derive from him, (he could not communicate a better than he had, and the &s;econd Adam has derived the humane Nature from our fir&s;t Parents) as in the Covenant made with him, and his Po&s;terity after him, of which we have an Account in the following Places of Scripture, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.16, 17. In this Covenant, the great God contracts with his Creature as with a Servant, by Way of &s;overeign Empire; pre&s;cribing to him what Terms he plea&s;ed. In the threatning of Death in Ca&s;e of Di&s;obedi|ence, is doubtle&s;s imply'd a Promi&s;e of Life in Ca&s;e of Obe|dience; and hence it is expre&s;ly call'd a Covenant, Ho&s;. 6.7. <HI>But they like</HI> Adam, <HI>have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the Covenant.</HI></P>
<P>That <HI>Adam</HI>'s whole Po&s;terity was involved in his Guilt, in eating of the forbidden Fruit, and in the Mi&s;eries con&s;equent thereupon, is written as with a Sun-Beam in that famous Scripture, Rom. 5.12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. there Death is &s;aid <HI>to pa&s;s upon all,</HI> and that <HI>becau&s;e all had &s;inned.</HI></P>
<P>Now it can't be in Rea&s;on &s;uppo&s;ed, that they could &s;in actually and per&s;onally before they had a Being, therefore it mu&s;t be by Imputation.</P>
<P>Does not the univer&s;al Experience of all <HI>Adam's</HI> Po&s;terity, loudly proclaim the afore&s;aid Truth? If his Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion was not imputed to them, whence &s;hould &s;pring their early Propen&s;ity or Inclination to Vice, before they have Time to contract it by Practice and Example? Can a Stream flow without a Fountain, a Branch grow without a Tree? Does
<PB N="39" REF="005299_0046_1016F751024417E8">
not Mankind by &s;ome Kind of actual Imitation, approve the original Tre&s;pa&s;s, and &s;o transfer its Guilt upon them&s;elves? Whence &s;hould come that Train of Mi&s;eries, that Compli|cation of Calamities, that make all the Creation groan, and infe&s;t the whole humane Race, if the Sin of <HI>Adam</HI> be not imputed?</P>
<P>How is it that tender Infants, before they become capable of actual Offences, &s;hould be expo&s;ed to Death it &s;elf, in its mo&s;t hideous Form, and to all tho&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es which are the U&s;hers of it? Will not the Judge of all the Earth do right? Will the ju&s;t God inflict capital Puni&s;hment where there is no Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, either imputed or inherent? Does the Almighty afflict willingly, or grieve the Children of Men? No &s;urely! Shall the Wages of Sin be paid without any Re|lation to the Work? Yea the Apo&s;tle a&s;&s;erts, 1 Cor. 15.22. <HI>That in Adam all die.</HI> Now &s;eeing that Death is the proper Wages of Sin, by divine Ordination, it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed that all &s;inned: but Per&s;ons not exi&s;ting, could not &s;in any other Way than by the Imputation of the fir&s;t Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is evident from the Parrallel drawn by the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> between the fir&s;t and &s;econd <HI>Adam,</HI> that the fir&s;t was a pub|lick Per&s;on as well as the &s;econd; &s;ee <HI>Rom.</HI> 5. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15. They are &s;poken of, as if there were but the&s;e two Per&s;ons in the World, becau&s;e they were Heads of different Covenants, <HI>viz.</HI> of Works, and Grace; and Repre&s;enta|tives of different Po&s;terities, <HI>viz.</HI> natural and &s;piritual. Yea <HI>Adam</HI> is expre&s;ly &s;aid to be the Figure of him that was to come.</P>
<P>The Hi&s;tory of the fir&s;t Man gives farther Confirmation to the afore&s;aid Truth, where we read that all the Good and Evil that befell him, were a&s;crib'd to him, as a publick Per|&s;on; who was to be the Example and Pledge of his Po&s;terity. Before the Fall the original Righteou&s;ne&s;s he po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, and Empire over the Creatures, as well as his Marriage and Ble&s;&s;ing, re&s;pected all; and after the Fall the Mi&s;eries which befel him, re&s;pected not only him&s;elf, but all his Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t certainly we &s;inned after the &s;ame Manner in <HI>Adam,</HI> as we are ju&s;tify'd in Chri&s;t; namely by Imputation: and if the fir&s;t be deny'd, why not the latter? and then the Foundation of the Go&s;pel is over&s;et, and nothing left in the
<PB N="40" REF="005299_0047_1016F753CB8B0078">
Room of it, but a Sy&s;tem of moral Virtue. And it may be ob&s;erved in Confirmation of what has been now offered, that the Denial of original Sin imputed, naturally leads to, and often i&s;&s;ues in, the Denial of the Saviour's imputed Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s to Ju&s;tification.</P>
<P>I cannot &s;ee any Unrea&s;onablene&s;s in the A&s;&s;ertion, of the fir&s;t Man's repre&s;enting his whole Race, &s;eeing that the Be|nefits of his Obedience, if he had &s;tood, would have re|dounded to his Po&s;terity, as really as if they had per&s;onally kept the Covenant. Now by a Parity of Rea&s;on, it is but ju&s;t that they &s;hould be expo&s;ed to the Di&s;advantages of his Fall.</P>
<P>The Situation of Mankind in having one common Repre|&s;entative, was better than if every Man had &s;tood for him|&s;elf, Head for Head: which appears thus; <HI>Adam</HI> had not only as great a Capacity to &s;tand, con&s;idered in a private Character, as any other could be &s;uppo&s;ed to have, being made upright, as <HI>Solomon</HI> ob&s;erves: He had a perfect Know|lege of the divine Mind, &s;o far as concerned his Duty and Happine&s;s; a univer&s;al Rectitude which &s;pread through his whole Soul, and governed all his Powers and Pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides this, he had the Con&s;ideration of thereby &s;e|curing the Happine&s;s of his whole Offspring, to incite him to &s;tand, and the Ruin of his whole Race to deter him from the contrary: And are not the&s;e important Motives to ge|nerous Minds? Now if every Man had &s;tood for him&s;elf, without any publick Repre&s;entative, they could not have had tho&s;e Incentives to Per&s;everance in Goodne&s;s, and con|&s;equently there would not have been &s;uch a great Probability of their Standing. Be&s;ides <HI>Adam</HI> being newly form'd, had a fre&s;h Sen&s;e of creating Goodne&s;s, which mu&s;t needs offer additional Influence to his Love and Obedience. By the&s;e Con&s;iderations it appears that Man's Condition in having a federal Head, was better than if it had been otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>God Almighty undoubtedly fore&s;aw, that all <HI>Adam's</HI> Po&s;|terity, would have yielded to the &s;ame &s;atanical Temptation with him, had they been thereto expo&s;ed; and therefore &s;ee|ing that that was certainly future, it might po&s;&s;ibly in &s;ome Sen&s;e, be e&s;teemed as committed.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="005299_0048_1016F755AA9AA590">Again, it is certain that the whole World of Mankind then exi&s;ting, did &s;in, and that thereby the Friend&s;hip of God with the whole World peri&s;hed, and con&s;equently with their Po&s;terity, &s;eeing that Children are but Parts or Pieces of their Parents.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that God is the Sovereign of the Uni|ver&s;e, the great Potter, and we but Clay in his Hands; that he has an ab&s;olute Right to do with his own as he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>It is indeed a marvellous In&s;tance of divine Goodne&s;s &amp; Con|de&s;cen&s;ion, that the great Lord of the Univer&s;e, &s;hould &s;toop &s;o low, as to enter into any Covenant with his Creatures at all, and much more &s;o when in the Manner before related!</P>
<P>To have Repre&s;entatives, is not unu&s;ual in civil Affairs. Do not Emba&s;&s;adors repre&s;ent the Prince and Nation that &s;ends them to a foreign State, and are not their Speeches and Actions interpretatively the Speeches and Actions of all their Con&s;tituents?</P>
<P>Do not Parents per&s;onate and oblige their Children un|born, by their civil Tran&s;actions re&s;pecting them; and when they covenant for their Benefit, who does or who ju&s;tly can blame the Practice?</P>
<P>And &s;eeing that to have a federal Head, or common Re|pre&s;entative, by Way of Covenant, was as has been ob&s;erved, the be&s;t Situation that Man could be in, re&s;pecting the pri|mitive Covenant Tran&s;action, if they had had their own Choice, whom could they have cho&s;en, that was &s;o fit to occupy that Place, that important Province, as him who was the Parent and Original of the whole humane Race, and otherwi&s;e &s;o qualified, as has been before hinted.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pelagians, Socinians, Je&s;uits, Arminians, Remom&s;trants, Moravians,</HI> and all other <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;ts,</HI> &s;o far as I know, do oppo&s;e the afore&s;aid momentuous Truth, which has &s;o direct and noble a Tendency to humble the Pride of Man, to make him &s;en&s;ible of his Mi&s;ery, and &s;o to prepare him for the dear Redeemer. Some of the Objections that are bro't by the afore&s;aid Adver&s;aries, are &s;uch as the&s;e following,</P>

<P N="3">3. They object, that it is incon&s;i&s;tent with the Omni&s;ci|ence and Truth of God, to reckon him to have &s;inned, who has not &s;inned, and with his Ju&s;tice to puni&s;h him.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> It's true, it is incon&s;i&s;tent with God's Omni&s;cience, to reckon him to have &s;inned actually, who has not &s;inned actually; but it is not incon&s;i&s;tent with his Omni&s;cience, to reckon him to have &s;inned virtually, or in the Cau&s;e, who has not &s;inned actually, or in his own Per&s;on: Neither is it unju&s;t to puni&s;h him, who has only &s;inned virtually, as we &s;ee in the Ca&s;e of Infants, who feel the Force of Death. We may rea&s;onably argue from Fact to Right in Re&s;pect of God.

<P>To &s;ay that the Guilt of original Sin is removed, and that the Guilt of actual remains; is in Effect to &s;ay, that a Per&s;on is at once half ju&s;tify'd and half condemn'd; in Chri&s;t, and without him; alive, and dead; Children of God, and of the Devil, at the &s;ame Time: and pray where &s;hall &s;uch mongrel Mon&s;ters go at Death?

What can be the Meaning of the afore&s;aid Notion, but to &s;et fallen Man on his Legs again in his own Conceit? and &s;ecretly to e&s;tabli&s;h the darling Idol of Free-will, to the Di&s;honour of Free-Grace, and the Di&s;paragement of the divine Sovereignty!</P>
<P>It is but to little Avail to acknowledge hereditary Corrup|tion, and in the mean Time to deny the Imputation of its Guilt; for then it is but an Infelicity or Unhappine&s;s, and no Fault. The Tendency of this &s;eems to be only to amu&s;e Mankind, and not to humble them at all. Per&s;ons are apt to be more ea&s;ily dec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d with &s;uch &s;ort of People; while they expre&s;s in &s;trong <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erms the Corruption of Nature, one would think they were &s;ound, as to the Doctrine of original Sin.

<P>But pray how can tho&s;e <HI>Moravians,</HI> and their Arminian Brethren, account for a Conveyance of original Corruption, without any Imputation of Guilt? I know of nothing in Scrip|ture or Rea&s;on to &s;upport it; if they do let them produce it.</P>
<P>Now is it any Wonder that the Moravian Sect are ea&s;y, when &s;uch &s;tupifying damnable Doctrines are advanced among them? When we &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider the gro&s;s Ignorance of a principal Per&s;on of their Party, as to many of the fundamen|tal

<P>But I ha&s;ten to con&s;ider another Thing propo&s;ed, which was, <Q><HI>II.</HI> To &s;hew what is &s;uppo&s;ed by, and implied in, our remem|bering and holding fa&s;t the Truths of Chri&s;t. <HI>And,</HI></Q></P>
<P N="1">1. I think it naturally and nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es, our Lia|blene&s;s to forget and loo&s;e Truths which we have once re|ceived, (and perhaps with &s;en&s;ible Complacence) in Judg|ment, Affection and Practice. Thro' our Ignorance, Cor|ruption, Credulity, and the plau&s;ible Arts of Seducers, who lye in wait to deceive, there be &s;o many doleful In&s;tances of this, in Writings both &s;acred and prophane, that it is need|le&s;s to &s;ay any Thing farther in Confirmation of it: Only this may be added, that the Command in our Text is ground|ed thereupon. There would be no Need of enjoining us to remember and hold fa&s;t, if we were not inclined naturally to let the precious Truths of Chri&s;t &s;lip out of our treache|rous Memories, and to turn from them to Error and Vanity, in our corrupt Affections!</P>
<P>Since we have fallen from the God of Truth by the Breach of the fir&s;t Covenant, Error is co-natural to us, our Hearts are a fit Soil to hatch and cheri&s;h that Cockatrice, and be|cau&s;e many Errors do either more openly or covertly befriend Sin and Security, therefore we are naturally inclin'd to re|ceive them, and revolt from the Doctrines of Truth to them!</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Devil who is the Father of Lies and Errors, has in our fallen State an unhappy Acce&s;s to our Souls, and if permitted, can ea&s;ily repre&s;ent Things in &s;uch a fal&s;e Light, as to rai&s;e a Prejudice in our Minds again&s;t Truth; and &s;o endanger our Apo&s;tacy therefrom. Hence Satan is ju&s;tly call'd a Spirit of Error, a &s;educing Spirit. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. The Command in our Text &s;uppo&s;es the dangerous Con&s;equences of forgetting the Truth, and letting it go, otherwi&s;e the contrary Duty would not be therein, with &s;o much Earne&s;tne&s;s pre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>When the Eye of the Body is blinded, one walks in con|tinual Danger, and knows not whither he goes; Per&s;ons may be then led any where to their Hurt; they may be conducted
<PB N="47" REF="005299_0054_1016F769080A5980">
contrary to their Expectation, to the Camp of their Enemies, in&s;tead of Friends, as the <HI>Syrians</HI> to <HI>Dama&s;cus.</HI></P>
<P>And how much more dreadful is it, when the Eye of the Soul is blinded, I mean that leading Power, the Under&s;tand|ing! When fal&s;e Teachers, by their bewitching Charms, and jugling Arts, do blind Men's Minds, they may then tri|umph over them, as the <HI>Phili&s;tines</HI> over poor <HI>Sam&s;on,</HI> when they had pluck'd out his Eyes.</P>
<P>As Truth has great Power to excite to Holine&s;s, &s;o Error to Sin, either open or &s;ecret, of Heart or Practice. How &s;trangely does it elate the Mind with Pride, in Re&s;pect of Men's own Attainments, and po&s;&s;e&s;s it with Prejudice again&s;t the Sons of Truth! Error di&s;conforms the Mind to the God of Truth, it often turns Zeal into a wrong Channel, and &s;eparates chief Friends. Hereby Churches and Families are torn in Pieces, with Breaches wide as the Sea. Some otherwi&s;e valuable Per&s;ons being poi&s;oned with Error, have made it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to pull down with great Indu&s;try, that Good which they once laboured to build up. Error in the Mind is the Fountain from which &s;prings Error in Prac|tice; and indeed the former is generally more difficultly cured than the latter, becau&s;e Per&s;ons have more Excu&s;es for the one than the other. Mi&s;takes in Opinion are not &s;o ea&s;y to be di&s;cern'd, as in Practice. But,</P>
<P N="3">3. The Command in our Text implies, that there are proper Means to be u&s;ed to prevent the afore&s;aid Evil, and Lo&s;s con&s;equent upon it: Otherwi&s;e to what valuable Pur|po&s;e would the Command &s;erve? Now the Means are &s;uch as the&s;e following.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Humility.</HI> The God of Truth dwells with the Hum|ble; whereas &s;piritual Pride (more e&s;pecially) is often the Fore-runner of a Fall in Doctrine or Practice; and indeed this Pride is &s;ometimes much di&s;guis'd with a Kind of Zeal, and Appearance of Humility, which is perhaps undi&s;cern'd by the Per&s;on that has it.</P>
<P>But in my Opinion a Di&s;po&s;ition to &s;eparate from a true Church, becau&s;e many of her Members are unconverted, and &s;ome are under Deadne&s;s, is a Sign of a proud Spirit: Were not the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> of old proud Separati&s;ts?</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="005299_0055_1016F76AAC168790">Our Lord allows the Wheat and Tares to grow together till Harve&s;t. But &s;ome ra&s;h Zealots are for parting them, or plucking them up directly, altho' they thereby ri&s;que the Safety of the Wheat.</P>

<P>But on the contray tho&s;e that walk humbly, walk &s;afely, and none but they.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Earne&s;t Labour,</HI> (by reading the Scriptures, Medita|tion on them, comparing Scripture with Scripture, hearing the Word preached) <HI>in order to under&s;tand the Truths of Chri&s;t more thoroughly, and in their Connection.</HI></P>
<P>It is al&s;o exceeding nece&s;&s;ary to be well acquainted with the <HI>Catechi&s;ms</HI> of the reformed Churches, which give a &s;um|mary View of the Principles of Religion; and with tho&s;e approved Books which do explain them. In particular, I would earne&s;tly recommend to your Peru&s;al, Mr. <HI>Vincent</HI>'s Explication of the A&s;&s;embly's Catechi&s;m, which is a mo&s;t valuable precious Performance.</P>
<P>And here I mu&s;t take Leave to ob&s;erve, that the Practice of <HI>&s;taying at Home,</HI> rather than going to hear &s;uch Mini&s;ters, (&s;ound in Principle and regular in Practice) as are judg'd by &s;ome to be <HI>unconverted,</HI> is un&s;criptural and of dangerous Tendency (in my Opinion,) for it hangs the whole Weight of the publick Wor&s;hip of God, upon the uncertain Judgment of Men. Tho' <HI>unconverted</HI> Mini&s;ters are not likely to do &s;o much Good as others, yet &s;eeing that many of them, doubt|le&s;s, do preach the &s;ame Word of God, which others do; why may not the &s;overeign God, who permits them by his Providence to come into the Mini&s;try, ble&s;s his Word deli|vered by them, for the Good of Mankind?</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the afore&s;aid Practice of <HI>&s;taying at Home,</HI> &amp;c. opens a Door to Delu&s;ion by <HI>fal&s;e Teachers,</HI> as well as to <HI>Con|fu&s;ions</HI>

<P>Remember therefore how thou ha&s;t heard, and received, and hold fa&s;t.&mdash;</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_SEEING the Truths of Chri&s;t are a mo&s;t valua|ble and &s;acred Depo&s;itum, tran&s;mitted to us thro' much Expence of Labour and of Blood; it would be ba&s;e, ignoble, and ungrateful in us to lo&s;e them, thro' &s;ordid Negligence and Indiffe|rency; or to &s;uffer them, thro' Cowardi&s;e, to be betray'd and undermined by Impo&s;tors; without &s;ignifying our Sorrow for the Injury, and attempting to make &s;ome Defence.</P>
<P>Fora&s;much as the Church of Chri&s;t is begirt with nume|rous Enemies, of various Forms; Enemies open and &s;ecret, who labour almo&s;t ince&s;&s;antly, either by Force or Fraud, to corrupt her in her Principles, it is of the la&s;t Nece&s;&s;ity, to be con&s;tantly upon our Guard, and e&s;pecially in a Time of publick and epidemical Infection; le&s;t we be betrayed into the Labyrinths of Error and Mi&s;take, by the plau&s;ible Pre|tences of Seducers.</P>
<P>To this End, it is exceeding needful to u&s;e tho&s;e Means, which tend to our common Security. In the la&s;t Sermon, under the &s;econd general Head propo&s;ed, I made mention of three Means, which I judge proper to help us to retain the Truths of Chri&s;t; to which I would now add, the&s;e follow|ing, namely, in the</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="51" REF="005299_0058_1016F77454EE1FB0">4. Place, It is al&s;o exceeding nece&s;&s;ary, to implore the God of all Grace, that he would plea&s;e of his infinite Mercy to give us to <HI>feel the &s;pecial and powerful Influence of Truth upon our Minds and Hearts,</HI> that &s;o we may be moulded into the Image thereof, and thus transformed from Glory to Glory.</P>
<P>Altho' the bare doctrinal Knowlege of a true Sy&s;tem of religious Principles, be a valuable Privilege, in as much as it is a needful Preparative to that which is of a &s;aving Kind; yet it is dangerous and de&s;tructive, to re&s;t &s;atisfied with it, without the Experience of its Power and Influence. <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.17,&mdash;20.</P>
<P>A hearty and enduring Endeavour, with all Humility, to conform in Practice to the Truths we know, is a nece&s;&s;ary Mean to obtain E&s;tabli&s;hment in the Truth, and farther In|&s;truction. <HI>If any</HI> (&s;aith our Lord) <HI>doth the Will of God, he &s;hall know of the Truth whither it be of God.</HI> Per&s;everance in the Acknowledgement of the Truth, is God's free Gift, without which we cannot &s;tand. Now if we are not faith|ful in acting according to what we know, God's Spirit will be grieved, and we are in Danger of being given up to a Spirit of Error and Delu&s;ion. <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.21. 2 <HI>The&s;.</HI> 1.10, 11, 12.</P>
<P N="5">5. If we would hold fa&s;t the Truths of Chri&s;t, we mu&s;t <HI>avoid unnece&s;&s;ary Conver&s;ation with Per&s;ons gro&s;ly and funda|mentally erroneous.</HI> Tho&s;e that bring not the Doctrine of Chri&s;t with them, we mu&s;t not receive them into our Hou&s;es, or bid them God Speed; for if we do we are Partakers of their evil Deeds. See 2 Epi&s;t. of Joh. 8.9, 10. <HI>Look to your &s;elves therefore, that we lo&s;e not tho&s;e Things we have wrought.</HI> We are commanded to <HI>mark tho&s;e that cau&s;e Divi&s;ions, and to avoid them.</HI> Now Per&s;ons may be &s;aid to cau&s;e Divi&s;ions, when by fal&s;e Doctrine (and e&s;pecially about important Points) they alienate the Affections of good Men from each other, and break them into different Parties. Rom. 16.17. <HI>Now I be&s;eech you, Brethren, mark tho&s;e which cau&s;e Divi&s;ions and Offences, contrary to the Doctrine which ye have received, and avoid them; for they that are &s;uch, &s;erve not our Lord Je&s;us, but their own Belly, and by good Words and fair Speeches, deceive the Hearts of the &s;imple.</HI></P>

In order to pre&s;erve our &s;elves and our Po&s;terity from the Infection of Error, I think it is needful to u&s;e (in our proper Spheres) all &s;uitable Means to obtain a <HI>godly, learned, and regular Mini&s;try.</HI> In ordinary Ca&s;es, when any of the&s;e Qualifications is wanting, the Churches Safety is indangered in a greater or le&s;&s;er Degree.

To &s;ay, that the&s;e Qualifications may be ordinarily attained

without <HI>humane Learning,</HI> is notoriou&s;ly <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;tical</HI> and fooli&s;h. For it is an Expectation of an <HI>End</HI> in ordinary Ca&s;es, without the U&s;e of proper <HI>Means</HI> tending thereto. In&s;tead of tru&s;ting in God, this is a <HI>tempting</HI> of him. He who ac|knowleges, that the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> which are the Rule of our Faith and Practice, were originally written in other <HI>Tongues</HI> than are now <HI>Vulgar,</HI> mu&s;t have a weak Mind, an enthu|&s;ia&s;tical Heart, or a hard Forehead, if he denies the <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of humane Learning. In &s;hort, either humane Learning is nece&s;&s;ary, or there mu&s;t be <HI>In&s;piration,</HI> to &s;upply the want thereof. Do not therefore wonder at the enthu&s;ia&s;tical Talk of the <HI>Moravians,</HI> viz. <Q>That Per&s;ons mu&s;t &s;peak no more in religious Matters, then <HI>God has wro't in their Hearts.</HI></Q>
This I take to be <HI>In&s;piration,</HI> in other Words; e&s;pecially when it is con&s;ider'd in Connection with their Advice again&s;t <HI>preparatory Studies.</HI> Methinks, it is in a manner Self-evident, that all tho&s;e who deny the Nece&s;&s;ity of hu|mane Learning, in ordinary Ca&s;es, to prepare Per&s;ons for the Mini&s;try, are Enthu&s;ia&s;ts.</P>
<P>What&s;oever good Appearance, thru&s;ting out <HI>ignorant</HI> Per|&s;ons (how <HI>pious</HI> &s;oever) into the Mini&s;try may have, yet it is a <HI>dangerous</HI> Practice, tending directly to <HI>divide</HI> and <HI>cor|rupt</HI> the Church of God, and bring the Mini&s;try thereof into <HI>Contempt.</HI> Be&s;ides, when Per&s;ons intrude into the mini|&s;terial Work, without any previous <HI>Trial</HI> and <HI>Licence,</HI> from tho&s;e who by Virtue of their <HI>Office</HI> are con&s;tituted <HI>Judges</HI> in &s;uch Ca&s;es, it is doubtle&s;s our Duty to <HI>di&s;countenance</HI> them, let them pretend what they will. None &s;hould <HI>take this Honour to him&s;elf;</HI> but wait for God's Call and Appoint|ment. If any irregularly a&s;&s;ume the Po&s;ts of Officers, in the <HI>State</HI> or <HI>Army,</HI> it turns all into Confu&s;ion; and thus it is in the <HI>Church</HI> of God. Therefore all proper Care &s;hould be taken to prevent <HI>Intru&s;ions,</HI> which are pregnant with mi&s;chievous Con&s;equences.</P>
<P N="10">10. Another Mean to hold fa&s;t Chri&s;t's precious Truths, is <HI>to confer with our &s;piritual Guides,</HI> about Points that are controverted; to hear patiently, and con&s;ider calmly their Rea&s;onings; and to take Care, that we <HI>do not entertain un|rea&s;onable Prejudice again&s;t them.</HI> When the Spou&s;e inquired
<PB N="55" REF="005299_0062_1016F77E4714D9D8">
<HI>where her Beloved fed, and made his Flooks to re&s;t at Noon,</HI> &s;he was bid to go forth by the <HI>Foot&s;teps of the Flock,</HI> and feed her Kids be&s;ide <HI>the Shepherds Tents.</HI></P>
<P>Now, we &s;hould frequently and feelingly reflect upon the Truths which we have heard, and remember with what Affection we have heard them.</P>
<P>And it is our Duty to hold them fa&s;t, in the following Re&s;pects; namely,</P>
<P N="1">1. In the <HI>Judgment</HI> and <HI>A&s;&s;ent</HI> of our <HI>Minds.</HI> We &s;hould e&s;teem and approve of them, and judge them worthy of all Acceptance; more valuable than the fine&s;t Gold, and &s;weeter than Honey and the Honey-Comb; right, equal, holy, ju&s;t, and good; worthy of our Labour and Purcha&s;e; but not to be parted with at any Rate. Hence is that In|junction, Prov. 23.23. <HI>Buy the Truth and &s;ell it not.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. We &s;hould hold fa&s;t the Truths of Chri&s;t in our <HI>Affections.</HI> As Truth &s;hould be high in our E&s;teem, &s;o our Affections &s;hould be fixed upon it. Hence the Apo&s;tle pray'd Night and Day for the <HI>The&s;&s;alonians,</HI> that they might be filled with the Knowlege of his Will, in all Wi&s;dom and &s;piritual Under&s;tanding. The Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> &s;peaks of his loving an honourable Lady <HI>in the Truth,</HI> i. e. becau&s;e of the Truth; as he him&s;elf explains the Phra&s;e in the following Ver&s;e, namely the 2d Ver&s;e of his &s;econd Epi&s;tle.</P>
<P N="3">3. We &s;hould hold fa&s;t the Truth in our <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion.</HI> If we will not confe&s;s Chri&s;t before Men, he will not confe&s;s us before his heavenly Father. And indeed if we will not pro|fe&s;s the dear and precious Truths of the Redeemer, we are not worthy to be called his Di&s;ciples. If we are a&s;hamed of him and of his Truths in the mid&s;t of a froward and adul|terous Generation, of us will the Son of Man be a&s;hamed, when he comes in the Glory of his Father, with the holy Angels.</P>
<P N="4">4. We &s;hould hold fa&s;t the Truths of Chri&s;t in our <HI>Prac|tice.</HI> Hence we are commanded to <HI>adorn the Doctrine of God our Saviour in all Things.</HI> We &s;hould walk as Lights in the World, that tho&s;e who &s;eek to accu&s;e our good Conver&s;ation in Chri&s;t may be a&s;hamed. We &s;hould hold forth the Word of Truth in our Practice, that thereby the Ignorance of fooli&s;h Men

may be put to Silence. O it is to be lamented, if po&s;&s;ible with Tears of Blood! when the Enemies of Truth get &s;eem|ing Occa&s;ion of Reproach and Triumph, by Blunders in the Lives of the Profe&s;&s;ors of it. O let us be careful that the Intere&s;ts of Truth &s;uffer not, thro' our Mi&s;conduct! let us endeavour to remove Occa&s;ion from tho&s;e who &s;eek Oc|ca&s;ion!</P>
<P>By our Practice, we &s;hould &s;hew to the World our Ab|horrence of Deceivers, and fundamentally erronious Per&s;ons, as we would do of Per&s;ons that have Plague Sores upon them; unle&s;s it be to convince, reclaim, oppo&s;e and confute them. It is an incon&s;i&s;tent, unju&s;tifiable Weakne&s;s, to pretend to hate Error, and yet court the Company of Schi&s;maticks, En|thu&s;ia&s;ts, Seducers, and Hereticks. No Love to Per&s;ons &s;hould equal our Love to the dear and precious Truths of Chri&s;t. Tho&s;e Per&s;ons who dare pre&s;umptuou&s;ly and need|le&s;ly ru&s;h into the Company of Errori&s;ts, &s;eem to have either little Love to Truth, or little Sen&s;e of their own Weakne&s;s. I am apt to think that &s;uch Per&s;ons would take more Care of their Bodies in a Time of Infection, than they do of their poor Souls. But I proceed to con&s;ider the la&s;t Thing pro|pos'd, <Q><HI>III. To &s;hew</HI> why we &s;hould hold fa&s;t the Truths of Chri&s;t.</Q> <HI>And,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. We ought to do &s;o, becau&s;e it is the <HI>Command of God,</HI> in the Text, which I am now con&s;idering: And el&s;ewhere, the Lord enjoins us by his &s;overeign Authority, to <HI>hold fa&s;t the Form of &s;ound Words,</HI> 2 Tim. 1.3. To <HI>contend ear|ne&s;tly for the Faith which was once delivered to the Saints,</HI> Jud. 3. To catch the <HI>Foxes, the little Foxes that &s;poil the Vines, be|cau&s;e the Vines have tender Grapes,</HI> Cant. 2.15. To beware of <HI>fal&s;e Prophets,</HI> and <HI>Wolves in Sheeps cloathing,</HI> Mat. 7.15. To beware of the <HI>Leaven of the Phari&s;ees,</HI> Math. 16.6.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Truth</HI> is the <HI>Foundation</HI> of all <HI>practical Goodne&s;s.</HI> It is the Mean (1) of our Illumination: the P&s;almi&s;t ob&s;erved <HI>that God's Word was a Light to his Feet and a Lamp to his Path.</HI> (2) of our Sanctification: <HI>Sanctify them thro' thy Truth, thy Word is Truth.</HI> 1 Pet. 1.22. <HI>Seeing ye have purifyed your Souls in obeying the Truth, thro' the Spirit.</HI>
<PB N="57" REF="005299_0064_1016F782B7373548">
(3) of our Con&s;olation. P&s;al. 119.50. <HI>This is my Comfort in my Affliction, for thy Word hath quickned me.</HI> The &s;weet Truths of God's Word are the Fountain of our Comfort, and Foundation of our Hopes. Per&s;ons do grow in Grace ju&s;t as in the Knowlege of Truth; and hence we are bid to <HI>grow in Grace, and in the Knowlege of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Whatever Per&s;ons may imagine or pretend, in Re&s;pect of their Frames and Comforts, if they grow more dark and ignorant as to the Knowlege of Truth, we have no Rea&s;on to think, if they have any Grace, that they grow in it; but rather that they go backward: and if their Errors be many and fundamental, its probable they are under a Delu|&s;ion of the Devil.</P>
<P N="3">3. We &s;hould remember and hold fa&s;t the Truths of Chri&s;t, becau&s;e of their <HI>Author</HI> and <HI>Tendency.</HI> God the Fa|ther is the God of Truth: The Son of God is the Way, the Truth and the Life: The holy Spirit is a Spirit of Truth: The Law of God is Truth and Righteou&s;ne&s;s: The Go&s;pel is a Go&s;pel of Truth, it is &s;til'd emphatically <HI>the Truth.</HI> The Children of God are Children of Truth; Children that won't Lie: The Promi&s;es and Threatnings of the Word are true as Truth it &s;elf; they are harmonious, firm and &s;tedfa&s;t. Now the Tendency of Truth is to conform us to the God of Truth, who is its Parent and great Original. And is not this our highe&s;t Honour, and our greate&s;t Intere&s;t?</P>
<P N="4">4. Such as do not <HI>love</HI> the Truth, are in Danger of <HI>De|lu&s;ion</HI> and <HI>Damnation.</HI> 2 The&s;. 2.9, 10, 11, 12. <HI>Even him who&s;e coming is after the working of Satan, with all Power and Signs and lying Wonders, and with all deceivablene&s;s of Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s in them that peri&s;h; becau&s;e they received not the Love of the Truth that they might be &s;aved; and for this Cau&s;e God &s;hall &s;end them &s;trong Delu&s;ion, that they &s;hould believe a Lie, that they all might be damned, who believed not the Truth, but had Plea&s;ure in Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Ob&s;erve, my dear Bre|thren, that when Satan the Father of Error and Lies, draws People from the Truth, there is a Power attends his Work|ings, and that his In&s;truments carry on the Affairs of his Kingdom with great Deceit.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="58" REF="005299_0065_1016F78847FC8E40">5. We &s;hould hold fa&s;t the Truth, becau&s;e <HI>it is a Fruit of the Spirit,</HI> Eph. 5.5. It is mentioned to the Reproach of &s;ome, that they made Ship-wreck of Faith, and turned from the Truth to Fables, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.19. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.4, 6.</P>
<P>When Per&s;ons fall from the Truths of Chri&s;t, they &s;hew a childi&s;h Weakne&s;s and Ficklene&s;s. Children are fond of new Things, of Things that look bright, tho' they be of little Value; their Tin&s;els and Toys, are in their Opinion great Riches. Thus young Novices in Chri&s;tianity, who are ju&s;t beginning the Chri&s;tian Cour&s;e, ignorant in a great Mea|&s;ure as to Chri&s;tian Principles, but full of Affection and Self-conceit, when a Moravian comes among them, &s;ets down a while, and looks very harmle&s;s and innocent and &s;ober, gives &s;ome Smiles, and talks about the Blood of Chri&s;t, in their my&s;tical Way; and of Love, Love!&mdash; O brave! How are they taken with it directly, as a Child with a Rattle! His very &s;imple loving Looks, make them think he is almo&s;t an Angel. O what a fine Man is this! O the reformed Chur|ches are not fit to be mentioned in the &s;ame Day with this fine new Sect! They grow weary of the old &s;tale Truths of the Reformation, they want to change their Principles almo&s;t as fa&s;t as their Almanacks; with the <HI>Athenians</HI> they mu&s;t have &s;omething new.</P>
<P>Such who change their Principles for the wor&s;e, bring great Di&s;honour upon God's Name, as well as Grief to his People, and Injury to his Kingdom. O it cau&s;es the holy Name of God to be bla&s;phemed, when Per&s;ons who are either really or apparently religious, turn with every Bla&s;t, and &s;oon &s;uffer them&s;elves to be &s;mil'd out of their Religion! And tho&s;e who are enabled of pure Grace to adhere to the dear and precious Truths of Chri&s;t in a Time of Tempta|tion and Apo&s;tacy, O it covers their Faces with Shame, and fills their Hearts with Grief, to behold tho&s;e with whom they were won't to take &s;weet Coun&s;el, herding with Hereticks and Enthu&s;ia&s;ticks, and turning Fugitives from the Truths and Camp of Chri&s;t! Tell it not in <HI>Gath,</HI> publi&s;h it not in the Streets of <HI>Askelon,</HI> le&s;t the Daughters of the Phili&s;tines rejoyce, the Daughters of the Uncircumci&s;ed triumph, and

&s;ay, <HI>thus would we have it?</HI> Saints are hereby &s;tumbled, and Sinners prejudiced, and the Ways of Zion mourn.</P>
<P N="6">6. By holding fa&s;t the Truths of Chri&s;t, we &s;hall <HI>prove that we are living Members of the Church militant;</HI> which is called <HI>the Pillar and Ground of Truth,</HI> 1 Tim. 3.15. And el&s;ewhere it is &s;aid concerning &s;ome, who lived in the apo&s;to|lick Times, that they <HI>went out from them, becau&s;e they were not of them.</HI> And hence it is &s;aid that <HI>Here&s;ies mu&s;t needs come, that tho&s;e that are approved may be made manife&s;t.</HI> For indeed it &s;hews a weak Head, or a fal&s;e Heart, or violent Temptations of the Devil, to be &s;uddenly to&s;&s;ed about with every Wind of Doctrine, by the Slight and Craftine&s;s of tho&s;e that lie in wait to deceive. By &s;peaking the Truth from our Hearts, we &s;hew our &s;elves to be Members of the Church triumphant. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 15.2. By cleaving to the Truths of God, we &s;hew our &s;elves to be guided by the Spirit of God; for he is promi&s;ed to lead the People of God into all Truth: And hence he is called the Spirit of Truth, <HI>Joh.</HI> 14.17.</P>
<P N="7">7. Methinks the <HI>Sufferings and Blood af the innumerable Army of Martyrs,</HI> in Te&s;timony to Truth, &s;hould in&s;pire us with a holy Magnanimity and un&s;haken Stedfa&s;tne&s;s of Re&s;olution, to &s;uffer the Lo&s;s of every Thing that is natu|rally dear to us, rather than for&s;ake the dear and precious Truths of the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us. Let us behold the Cloud of Witne&s;&s;es, that have gone before us; tho&s;e heroick brave and gallant Souls, in Defence of precious, precious, precious Truth, have &s;wam thro' a Sea of Sorrows, of Sufferings, and of Blood, to their Father's Kingdom. Away, away then with that accur&s;ed Indifferency, and Lukewarmne&s;s, about Chri&s;t's precious Truths, which &s;ome do fal&s;ely call Charity and Catholici&s;m! Let us ri&s;e up and plead the Cau&s;e of Truth, and defend it to our dying Breath. The more others do trample upon Truth, the more let us e&s;teem and value it; the more dear let it be to our very Souls. O let us &s;toop down, and with the humble&s;t Reverence, and mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate affectionate Affection, let us take this in|e&s;timably valuable Jewel out of the Dirt, and put it in our inmo&s;t Bo&s;oms!</P>

<P>From what has been &s;aid we &s;hould be induced to <HI>examine our &s;elves,</HI> as to our Re&s;pect to <HI>Truth,</HI> and the Influence it has upon us. It &s;ignifies little, my Brethren, to profe&s;s Regard and Love to Holine&s;s, while Truth, preci|ous Truth is &s;lighted. It is a childi&s;h Weakne&s;s, to call it no wor&s;e; it is a beginning at the wrong End of Religion; it is ju&s;t as if a Man &s;hould &s;hew great Regard to the Super|&s;tructure of a Hou&s;e, and neglect the Foundation. What &s;ignify fair Shews of Love and Holine&s;s, without Truth for their Foundation? They are only Blinds to deceive the Simple, Rattles to plea&s;e Children.</P>
<P>It is a plain Sign of an <HI>enthu&s;ia&s;tical</HI> and deluding Spirit, to &s;light that precious <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> of Truths, which we have laid before us, in a mo&s;t plain con&s;i&s;tent and excellent Man|ner, in our <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Confe&s;&s;ion</HI> of Faith, and <HI>Catechi&s;ms;</HI> among which we &s;ee a &s;trong Connection, and charming Harmony; and in which, if we are not blinded with Ig|norance or Prejudice, we may perceive a tran&s;cendent Beauty, a direct Tendency to exalt all the Honours of the divine Attributes, to humble the Pride of Man, and conform him to the Deity, in univer&s;al Goodne&s;s and Holine&s;s: There Vice, of every Kind &amp; Form, is ju&s;tly repre&s;ented in its own native Dre&s;s of Horror and Meanne&s;s: There &s;incere Holi|ne&s;s is fix'd upon it's proper and impregnable Ba&s;is; and open'd in it's va&s;t Extent and attractive Magnificence, and encourag'd with all proper pertinent and powerful Incen|tives: There the Creatures Crown is ca&s;t at the dear Re|deemer's Feet, and all the Glory of it's Happine&s;s, a&s;crib'd to the Mediation of our great Immanuel: There the a&s;to|ni&s;hing Beauties of the pure, free, &s;overeign, rich, inex|hau&s;tible and glorious Grace of God, are unvail'd, in a con&s;i&s;tency with the Creatures Duty; &s;o as hereby to e&s;tab|li&s;h the Intere&s;ts of Vertue and Piety, upon the mo&s;t pre|vailing and ingenuous Motives!

Non&s;en&s;e, and damnable Errors; Errors that affect the very Foundations of Religion, both in Doctrine and Practice;&mdash; is it not vile Enthu&s;ia&s;m, and dete&s;table De|lu&s;ion?</P>
<P>Certainly the Ca&s;e of &s;uch who have known the Truths of Chri&s;t, and turn from them to Vanity, Lies, and Non|&s;en&s;e, is more inexcu&s;able, than of tho&s;e who have been breed up in Ignorance. O what a fooli&s;h Choice do they make, in bartering away the fine&s;t Gold for the ba&s;e&s;t Dro&s;s? What unaccountable Ingratitude do &s;uch expre&s;s to the great and good God, for all the religious Privileges &amp; Means of Improvement they have had? They turn their Backs upon the un&s;ullied Snow, and &s;acred Sweets of <HI>Lebanon,</HI> and pur&s;ue after poi&s;onous Streams and muddy Waters.</P>
<P>To pretend to introduce into <HI>one Communion,</HI> all that have an Appearance of Experience, Affection, and Piety, with|out &s;earching into their main <HI>Principles,</HI> without a Concur|rence in them (as I have Rea&s;on to think the <HI>Moravians</HI> do) is to build <HI>Babel</HI> over again, and promote the Confu&s;ion of Languages.</P>
<P>It cannot be rea&s;onably expected, that &s;uch a confus'd Medley, &s;uch a heterogeneous Mixture will &s;tand long, for it has no &s;olid Foundation to &s;tand upon. To pretend to promote Love and Union, by concealing our Principles and le&s;&s;ening our Regard to Truth, is to do Evil that Good may come. Indeed it is the direct Road to Divi&s;ion and Con|tention; and this the Event proves. To love Per&s;ons in a general View as Chri&s;tians, without due Re&s;pect had to their main peculiar <HI>Principles,</HI> is an unrea&s;onable childi&s;h Pa&s;&s;ion, more &s;it for Children and Simpletons, than for Men of Un|der&s;tanding. For, as <HI>Solomon</HI> ob&s;erves, <HI>the &s;imple Man be|lieves every Word,</HI> Prov. 14.15. A pretended Union with|out a Sy&s;tem of <HI>Principles</HI> acknowledged, is rather a Confe|deracy, than a &s;criptural Union. It is infinitely more can|did, to let others freely know our Scheme of Principles, that &s;o they may judge of them; and in Things of &s;maller Mo|ment, to u&s;e Moderation and Forbearance; and to make no more Terms of Communion, than Chri&s;t him&s;elf has
<PB N="62" REF="005299_0069_1016F793759F5350">
fixed. Any other Union is neither rational, nor de&s;irable, and de&s;erves not the Name of Union.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Moravian</HI> Concealment of their pernicious Prin|ciples, &s;eems to be a Fulfilment of St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Prophe&s;y, con|cerning fal&s;e Teachers, that they &s;hould <HI>privily</HI> (or covertly) <HI>bring in damnable Here&s;ies. Plutarch</HI>'s Story of a Boy that carried &s;omething under his Cloak, may be applied to them. The Boy was asked by a Stranger, What it was he carried &s;o clo&s;ely under his Cloak? To whom the Boy an&s;wered, you may well know, that it is &s;omething I don't intend you &s;hall know, by &s;o carrying it. All Religion that is worth a rea|&s;onable Man's Choice is gone, when Truth is gone. All that is left is childi&s;h Fancy, enthu&s;ia&s;tical Folly, and painted Pageantry.</P>
<P>For any Men to pretend to <HI>know</HI> certainly who are <HI>graci|ous,</HI> as one of the <HI>Moravians</HI> did in my hearing, is to a&s;&s;ume an incommunicable Prerogative of God: and to run upon this <HI>fal&s;e</HI> Plan in Church-Matters, is to turn all into the wilde&s;t <HI>Di&s;order</HI> and <HI>Confu&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>Methinks the Con&s;ideration of the Truths of God, may ju&s;tly <HI>alarm the Secure</HI> and <HI>Impenitent,</HI> and excite them to fly from Sin to God, and humble them&s;elves before him, and &s;eek his Favour; &s;eeing that all the Threats of God are pointed at them like &s;o many burning Thunderbolts, which the Truth of God will oblige him to di&s;charge at them, ex|cept Repentance intercept the falling Blow.

They generally &s;hun Debate, which would try their Meekne&s;s: but if any of them happen to be try'd a little, they &s;hew their Weakne&s;s as much as other People.

Like Foxes they craftily and &s;neakingly creep into the Vineyard, and &s;poil the tender Grapes with their dete&s;table Delu&s;ions. How very different are the Fruits of their coming into this Country, from the Reverend Mr. WHITEFIELD'S? His plain and pungent Preaching of the Truths of the Reforma|tion, united generally the Hearts of good Men thro' the Land.

<P>How very different are the&s;e Men from the Spirit of <HI>Lu|ther,</HI> whom they pretend a Re&s;pect to.

<P N="5">5.

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>_I Think it nece&s;&s;ary to annex an Account, of &s;ome of the Errors which Count <HI>Zinzendorf</HI> not long &s;ince expre&s;&s;ed in <HI>New-Brun&s;wick:</HI> &s;ome of which I heard him a&s;&s;ert my &s;elf, and the re&s;t were heard by Mr. <HI>Henerick Vi&s;her,</HI> a Per&s;on of good Intelligence and Probity. The Count not giving Liberty for two to be pre&s;ent with him at one Time, when Que&s;tions were ask'd about religi|ous Matters, there was no Room left for a joint Te&s;timony to all the following Articles.</P>
<P>The mi&s;chievous Effects of the Moravian Conver&s;ation, in &s;ome Places in this Part of <HI>America,</HI> in corrupting reli|gious Per&s;ons with fal&s;e Notions of divine Things, and in making unhappy Divi&s;ions among them; together with their extraordinary Method of concealing (generally) their perni|cious Principles, is I think a &s;ufficient Apology for the pre|&s;ent E&s;&s;ay to di&s;cover them to the World, in the Manner I have now taken. Now the Particulars are the&s;e following:</P>
<Q><P N="1">1. That it is not needful to preach the Law, but hurtful, under the Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the Law is not a Rule of Life to a Believer.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the Unconverted are not under the Law, under the Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation.</P>
<P N="4">4. That the moral Law belongs only to the Jews.</P>
<P N="5">5. That Conviction is not nece&s;&s;ary to Conver&s;ion, but very hurtful: and that the Presbyterian Doctrine re&s;pecting preaching of the Law, is fal&s;e.</P>
<P N="6"><PB REF="005299_0081_1016F7B71FA11B60">6. That tho&s;e who are ju&s;tified, are ju&s;tified from Eter|nity in the Sight of God, and actually at the Time of the Crucifixion of our Lord.</P>
<P N="7">7. That Faith is not a Mean or In&s;trument of Ju&s;tification.</P>
<P N="8">8. That Faith is only a Mean of the comfortable enjoy|ment of Ju&s;tification.</P>
<P N="9">9. That Faith is not nece&s;&s;ary to Ju&s;tification or Salvation.</P>
<P N="10">10. That the Nature of Faith con&s;i&s;ts in a Per&s;wa&s;ion or Belief, that our Sins are pardoned, and that Chri&s;t died for us. It being objected, that if the Nature of Faith con&s;i&s;ts in the afore&s;aid Per&s;wa&s;ion, then when it was gone, Faith would be lo&s;t: He re|ply'd, 'That the Nature of Faith might be lo&s;t, but not the Thing it &s;elf or Being of it.</P>
<P N="11">11. That there is no &s;uch Thing as &s;piritual Pre&s;umption.</P>
<P N="12">12. That no gracele&s;s Creatures had hi&s;torical Faith, 'but the Devils.</P>
<P N="13">13. That the Guilt of <HI>Adam's</HI> Sin was removed from all, by the Death of Chri&s;t; that his Cro&s;s was the Period or End of it.</P>
<P N="14">14. That a Man is converted as &s;oon as he has an abi|ding Sen&s;e of his Sin and Danger: for he a&s;&s;erted that the Sen&s;e afore&s;aid, flows from a Principle of divine Life.</P>
<P N="15">15. That the Conver&s;ion of the reformed Church, by a preparatory Law-Work, was only a Delu&s;ion: and that there was none of the Moravian Brethren converted that Way, that he knew of.</P>
<P N="16">16. That the exerci&s;ing of Rea&s;on in the Apprehen&s;ion of any Danger, was not nece&s;&s;ary to Conver&s;ion; becau&s;e he &s;aid it was done in the twinkling of an Eye, without preceeding Preparatives.</P>
<P N="17">17. That a converted Per&s;on cannot &s;in again&s;t Light, and that if they &s;inn'd, they tho't what they did was good.</P>
<P N="18">18. That <HI>David</HI> was unconverted when he committed Adultery; and <HI>Peter</HI> when he denied his Ma&s;ter; and that <HI>Paul</HI> &s;peaks of him&s;elf as unconverted, in the whole &s;eventh Chapter to the <HI>Romans:</HI> That he
<PB N="75" REF="005299_0082_1016F7B8A65C0D98">
him&s;elf was a Sinner, and would be &s;o to Eternity, and that we &s;hall need Chri&s;t as much then as now. The Count being asked, whether a converted Per&s;on could Sin? He &s;aid, that he could if the Lord Je&s;us left him, but that he was &s;ure he would not.</P>
<P N="19">19. That old Te&s;tament In&s;tances might be brought for Illu&s;tration, but not for Proof.</P>
<P N="20">20. That Chri&s;t laid down his Life for all the Offspring of <HI>Adam:</HI> neverthele&s;s that there was a certain Election, but no Reprobation.</P></Q>
<P>The afore&s;aid Particulars are not Con&s;equences drawn from the Count's Words, but his own expre&s;s Declarations, and that for the mo&s;t Part in an&s;wer to Que&s;tions ask'd of him; &s;everal of which he rea&s;oned a little upon.</P>
<P>Here I &s;hall beg Leave to &s;ubjoin the Extract of a Letter from Mr. <HI>John Stockers,</HI> Merchant of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> (a Per&s;on of good Character) dated <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1741, to Mr. <HI>George Brinkerhoff</HI> Merchant of <HI>New-York,</HI> relating to the <HI>Mora|vians</HI> or <HI>Herenhouters,</HI> tran&s;lated from the Dutch.</P>
<Q><P>As to the <HI>Herenhouters,</HI> much might be &s;aid, beyond the Bounds of a Letter. The pa&s;toral Letter is a lively Repre&s;entation of them. Mr. <HI>Kulencamp</HI> the Author of that Letter, has wrote two other &s;mall Tracts again&s;t them; and al&s;o the Reverend Mr. <HI>Knypers;</HI> and three Profe&s;&s;ors; <HI>viz.</HI> the Reverend Me&s;&s;ieurs <HI>Honert, Voget,</HI> and <HI>Gelders,</HI> have wrote again&s;t them.</P>
<P>I account them a mi&s;chievous People, wor&s;e than ever the <HI>Labadi&s;ts</HI> appeared to be, who were orthodox in the Point of Ju&s;tification: but the&s;e People have a Mixture of many Errors, I &s;hall mention &s;ome of the chief.</P>
<P>That Man is Part of the divine Being.</P>
<P>They hold the Perfection of the Saints in this Life.</P>
<P>They believe that Saints may fall away; and likewi&s;e that one may be &s;aved in the Profe&s;&s;ion of the Pagan and Jewi&s;h-Religion.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="005299_0083_1016F7BA2B63DD48">They believe that all Men, yea and even the very De|vils ill be &s;aved.</P>
<P>Who will not be a&s;toni&s;hed at &s;uch Propo&s;itions, from Men who give them&s;elves out for ab&s;olved Chri&s;tians, who are bought by the Price of the Blood of the Lamb! and who are &s;imple and harmle&s;s, while they are full of Sub|tlety, and cheri&s;h a Complication of Errors.</P>
<P>They are al&s;o in&s;incere and incon&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves, propo&s;ing that at one Time, which at another Time they will deny; going about with Untruths; having no Regard for the Truths and the written Word, pretending that they have Chri&s;t within them, to be a living Bible; and &s;uch like Things as the&s;e.</P>
<P>Their Meetings are no more &s;uffered among&s;t us, be|ing neither in&s;tructive nor profitable. They will read a Chapter out of the Bible, particularly out of the new Te&s;tament; upon which they &s;peak in &s;ome confu&s;ed Manner; &s;ing &s;ome of their Hymns; and it may be they will pray, which has but little in it. See here in brief &s;omething of them.</P>
<P>They were treated in a mild and in a friendly Manner, but would not &s;uffer them&s;elves to be examined. Its true they don't belong to the reformed Church, but they pretend to go between the <HI>Lutheran</HI> and the reformed Church, and that they are neither of the one nor of the other, but that they come neare&s;t the <HI>Lutheran.</HI> The Lord be prai&s;ed, they have not triumph'd, for by that Means all Religion would have been in Confu&s;ion, and the fun|damental Truths taken away; by which the Church mu&s;t either &s;tand or fall. Therefore away with &s;uch! Or as the Apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>from &s;uch turn away.</HI> Thus far with Re&s;pect to the <HI>Herenhouters.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Mr. <HI>Samuel Finley,</HI> a Preacher of the Go&s;pel, informs me, in a Letter from <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> bearing Date, <HI>February</HI> 15. 1742.</P>
<P>That he had &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e with Count <HI>Zinzendorf</HI> by an Interpreter, (he refu&s;ing to di&s;cour&s;e with him in Latin, becau&s;e he was a Presbyterian) the Sum of which was as follows:</P>
<Q><PB N="77" REF="005299_0084_1016F7BD76DF35F0"><P N="1">1. The Count being asked, whether the Apo&s;tle &s;pake of him&s;elf as unconverted, thro' the whole &s;eventh Chap|ter of his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Romans?</HI> He an&s;wered in Engli&s;h; Yes; doubtle&s;s as unconverted.</P>
<P N="2">2. Re&s;pecting Perfection. The Count would &s;eem to grant that true Chri&s;tians had Sin; and yet when I la|boured to prove this, he would again &s;et up again&s;t me: this was ju&s;t the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">3. I inquired whether <HI>David</HI> was gracele&s;s when he committed Adultery? He an&s;wered, Yes. And all the Di&s;tinction he u&s;ed re&s;pecting this, was that there was Grace in Store for <HI>David,</HI> but that he had not then re|ceived it.</P>
<P N="4">4. I inquired about Ju&s;tification, whether it was eter|nal? He an&s;wered yes.</P>
<P N="5">5. I ask'd of what U&s;e Faith was in <HI>Ju&s;tification?</HI> He an&s;wered, that it was a Manife&s;tation of it.</P>
<P N="6">6. I inquired, Whether one that had Ju&s;tification mani|fe&s;ted clearly to his Con&s;cience, could ever doubt of it? He an&s;wered, that he might afterwards doubt of it.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, I inquired, whether the Saints would have need of Faith to all Eternity? He an&s;wered, Yes; and in&s;i&s;ted on it: But by this Time it was nine of the Clock at Night, and our Conver&s;ation ended.</P></Q>
<P>Here I &s;hall add &s;ome Extracts, out of a Moravian Book, thus Intitled; <Q>Sixteen Di&s;cour&s;es on the Redemption of Man by the Death of Chri&s;t, preach'd at <HI>Berlin,</HI> by the right Reverend and mo&s;t Illu&s;trious Count <HI>Zin|zendorf,</HI> Bi&s;hop of the ancient Moravian Church, tran&s;lated from the high Dutch, with a Dedica|tion to the Arch-Bi&s;hops, Bi&s;hops and Clergy, giving &s;ome Account of the Moravian Brethren. <HI>London</HI> Printed for <HI>James Hutton,</HI> 1740. This Book is prefaced and &s;igned by <HI>Ludovicus de Zinzendorf.</HI></Q></P>

Witne&s;&s;es of Di&s;tinction and Credit, who can atte&s;t the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Spangenberg</HI> one of the fir&s;t of the Moravian Mi&s;&s;io|naries into this Part of the Country, who &s;owed the Seed of their dreadful Doctrine in <HI>New-York,</HI> in a Di&s;cour&s;e with me oppo&s;ed &s;trenuou&s;ly the Doctrine of original Sin imputed, and laboured to enervate all that I bro't in Confirmation of it.</P>
<P>He likewi&s;e call'd the Prote&s;tant Churches a <HI>Babel</HI> (their's excepted) or compared them thereto. He likewi&s;e a&s;&s;erted (the fir&s;t Time that he was here,) the Salvation of the Damned, or that their Torments &s;hould be only for a Time; and la|boured to maintain this horrible Po&s;ition, again&s;t what I offered in Oppo&s;ition thereto. Indeed the la&s;t Time that I &s;aw him, he &s;eemed to be of a different Opinion as to the la&s;t Particular: but I have &s;een and heard of &s;o much incon|&s;i&s;tent Conduct in him and others of that Sect, that I can hardly avoid a Jealou&s;y of his Sincerity in that Matter: and &s;eeing the Count materially a&s;&s;erts it in his Sermons, as I have &s;hewn before, there is the more Rea&s;on to believe him and others of that Party to be guilty.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Spangenberg</HI> declaimed in my hearing, more then once, again&s;t human Learning, and look'd upon it as a con&s;idera|ble Hindrance in the Acqui&s;ition of divine Knowledge: He judged his Ca&s;e to be unhappy becau&s;e of his Learning, which he &s;aid he found difficult to forget.</P>
<P>He run down human Rea&s;on, as if it were u&s;ele&s;s in Re|ligion, and in the Room thereof inculcated the Doctrine of Simplicity, which in their Sen&s;e of it, upon mature and frequent Deliberation, I cannot but take to be real Folly and implicit Faith, a believing of Non&s;en&s;e, Contradictions, and my&s;terious Gibberi&s;h. When they a&s;&s;ert gro&s;s Con|tradictions, they tell us that we mu&s;t believe &s;imply; that is, we mu&s;t quit our Rea&s;on, and turn real Fools: we mu&s;t believe thro' thick and thin, Ab&s;urdities and Non&s;en&s;e, and &s;o turn Papi&s;ts. Let Simpletons, who &s;eem willing to &s;wal|low any Thing, con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly and &s;ea&s;onably the Injuncti|on of God him&s;elf by <HI>Solomon,</HI> Prov. 1.22. <HI>How long ye &s;imple ones will ye love Simplicity? and the Scorners delight in
<PB N="100" REF="005299_0107_1016F801B176A0D0">
their Scorning, and Fools hate Knowledge? Turn you at my Reproof.</HI></P>
<P>It is exceeding artful in the Moravians to inculcate this popi&s;h Doctrine, at their fir&s;t coming among a People e&s;pe|cially; for when once they have drunk in that, their Work is done; they may turn them into any Shape they will: Rea|&s;on and Argument are rendred u&s;ele&s;s; a Shadow of Plau&s;i|bility is enough. Thus the Moravians endeavour to u&s;e us, as the Phili&s;tines did <HI>Sam&s;on,</HI> fir&s;t pull out our Eyes, and lead us where they will in Triumph.</P>
<P>I might have taken Notice of more exceptionable Parti|culars in the Count's Sermons; but what I have taken No|tice of, are &s;ufficient to convince all, that are not blinded with Prejudice, or given up to &s;atanical Delu&s;ion, that their Principles are mo&s;t dete&s;table!</P>
<P>I expect that the Moravians will u&s;e Fox-like Shifts, to evade the Di&s;covery of their heretical and horrible Principles, by the preceeding Letters and Extracts, as they have done re&s;pecting what the Count &s;aid in <HI>New-Brun&s;wick.</HI> But Truth is great, and will prevail at la&s;t over Error and Artifice, and baffle all the &s;ly Tricks of Seducers, who lie in wait to deceive ignorant, &s;imple, and un&s;table Souls.</P>
<P>If any Per&s;on que&s;tion my Candor, I advi&s;e them to get the Count's Book, and read it them&s;elves deliberately and impartially, and ask for Light from Heaven to help them to di&s;tingui&s;h between Truth and Error.</P>
<P>It is contrary to my intended Brevity, to enter upon a particular Confutation of all the Errors contained in the Ser|mons; that would &s;well this Volumn to too great a Bulk: and indeed many of the Errors are &s;o ab&s;urd, that the bare mentioning of them is Confutation enough, to Per&s;ons of Judgment that are freed from a partial Bya&s;s.</P>
<P>What are the Count's Sermons but a bundle of Contradictions and Non&s;en&s;e, damnable Errors &amp; Here&s;ies, inter&s;per&s;ed with Pa&s;&s;ages of Truth and Sen&s;e? In them a preparatory Work by the Law of God is denied, Repentance excluded, Per|fection a&s;&s;erted eighteen Times, and denied twice; a new Purgatory invented, as well as a new Election from the Time of Chri&s;t's Death! In them the great Articles of
<PB N="101" REF="005299_0108_1016F806216FAD58">
Faith and Ju&s;tification are dreadfully corrupted; hi&s;torical Faith is a&s;&s;erted to be &s;aving; and all Per&s;ons are &s;aid to be ju&s;tified from the Time of Chri&s;t's Death; the active O|bedience of Chri&s;t is excluded from bearing any Part in our Ju&s;tification and Salvation! In them Enthu&s;ia&s;m is a&s;&s;erted, and recommended in diver&s;e In&s;tances; as well as all U&s;e of Means with Sinners, to in&s;truct &amp; alarm them, denied! In them all Manner of Wickedne&s;s is encouraged, as the mo&s;t di|rect Way to Conver&s;ion; all Virtue and religious Duty un|hing'd and di&s;couraged: according to them, no Means mu&s;t be u&s;ed by poor Sinners to obtain Conver&s;ion! In them Sin is repre&s;ented as a meer Triffle, unworthy of our Fear or Grief! In them the Happine&s;s of Heaven is de&s;troyed, by making the Saints to be poor and needy there! In them the faithful Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t are condemned for u&s;ing Means with poor Sinners, to convince them of their Mi&s;ery, and bring them to Je&s;us! In them the preaching of Terror to the unregerate is deny'd, which is &s;o frequently inculca|ted in the Word of God, and which was practis'd by Chri&s;t him&s;elf and his Apo&s;tles! In them Chri&s;t's Propitiation for Sins in Eternity, is a&s;&s;erted! In them univer&s;al Redemption, and univer&s;al Salvation, are a&s;&s;erted; as well as In&s;piration after the apo&s;tolical Times! In them our Lord is repre&s;ent|ed, as paying a Ran&s;om after his Death for Per&s;ons under Conviction! which is not only contrary to expre&s;s Scrip|ture (<HI>Heb.</HI> 7.27. <HI>Heb.</HI> 9.26, 28.) but notoriou&s;ly dero|gatory to the Sufficiency of the Atonement of our Lord Je&s;us in his Life, and at his Death for his Elect. In them the dete&s;table Arminian Doctrines <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Free-Will, and the final Apo&s;tacy of the Saints are inculcated; and thus the Pride of Sinners is flattered, and the Foundation of the Saints Comforts &s;hut up and &s;eal'd! In them the Count urges the univer&s;al Nece&s;&s;ity of A&s;&s;urance on Pain of Death eter|nal! And in the mean Time informs us, that Per&s;ons are &s;piritually alive and dead at the &s;ame Time! He tells us that when the Spirit convinces Per&s;ons they are lo&s;t, and have no Intere&s;t in the Kingdom of God, then they are found, they are Brethren, they are Children of God! Now either two contradictory Propo&s;itions can be both true at once, which

is impo&s;&s;ible in the Nature of Things, or el&s;e the Count charges a Fal&s;hood upon the Spirit of God. In them the Doctrine of original Sin imputed is denied, and the popi&s;h Doctrine of the Sacraments a&s;&s;erted! In them a good Tho't at Death is repre&s;ented a &s;ufficient to obtain Happine&s;s! In them Sin is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to be &s;omething mate|rial; and if &s;o, God mu&s;t needs be the Author of it, for he has made all Sub&s;tances! In them God's holy Law is con|demned, as the Cau&s;e of Sin: if &s;o, then God him&s;elf is the Cau&s;e of Sin, for he is the Author of the Law, and indeed it is but the Image of his moral Excellencies! It is a vile Abu&s;e of that Pa&s;&s;age of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> (1 Cor. 15.56. <HI>The Strength of Sin is the Law,</HI>) to conclude from hence that the Law is the Cau&s;e of Sin: The Meaning of the afore&s;aid Place is el&s;ewhere explained by the &s;ame Apo&s;tle, viz. Rom. 7.1. <HI>For Sin taking Occa&s;ion by the Commandment deceived me, and by it &s;lew me.</HI> The ob&s;tinate Corruption of our Nature, may unrea&s;onably take Occa&s;ion, from the ju&s;t Re&s;traints of the Commandment to rage the more; but that is not the Fault of the Law, but of our corrupt Na|ture. <HI>Was then that which is good Death to me?</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle! <HI>God forbid!</HI> The Apo&s;tle rejects the Notion of the Law's being the Cau&s;e of his Sin, with great Indignation; he &s;hews that this cannot be, Ver&s;es 12, 13, 14. Becau&s;e <HI>the Law is holy, ju&s;t and good:</HI> As if the Apo&s;tle &s;hould &s;ay, that which is holy cannot be the Cau&s;e of it's contrary; for like pro|duces like: <HI>But Sin that it might appear Sin, working Death in me by that which is Good, that Sin by the Commandment might appear exceeding &s;inful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> for we know that the Law is &s;piritual, but I am carnal.</HI> As if the Apo&s;tle &s;hould &s;ay, the Law is good, &s;piritual, di&s;covers Sin, and it's penal Con&s;equences; hence by it is &s;aid to be th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Knowledge of Sin,</HI> and that it <HI>works Wrath:</HI> how therefore can it be the Cau&s;e of Sin?

<P>The Moravian Notion about the Law, is a My&s;tery of dete&s;table Iniquity! And indeed this &s;eems to me to be
<PB N="103" REF="005299_0110_1016F8092C24A4D8">
the main Spring of their unrea&s;onable, anti-evangelical, and licentious Religion!</P>
<P>But I have not Time at pre&s;ent, to mention all the other Abominations of the Count's Sermons!</P>
<P>And now having had a Ta&s;te of their Principles, let us proceed to a brief Reflection, upon their Experience and Practice.</P>
<P>As to their Conver&s;ion, and after Experiences; the Con|ver&s;ion of the mo&s;t of them (if we credit the Count's A&s;&s;er|tion, and we may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e that he knows pretty well the State of his own Sect,) is very &s;lighty, it's without any preparatory Law Work, done in a Moment. If they have received the afore&s;aid Doctrines, have we not Rea&s;on to fear that their Conver&s;ion is but a &s;trong Flight of Ima|gination, or a &s;atanical Delu&s;ion. And we have the more Rea&s;on for the Fear afore&s;aid, when we con&s;ider how ea&s;y they are generally after their &s;uppo&s;ed Conver&s;ion, without Fears, without Complaints of Sin, Strangers to the &s;piritual War, Strangers to the Knowledge of their own Hearts, al|ways in one &s;ort of Frame, or as it were put to &s;leep and happy, as the Count expre&s;&s;es it. Did not the Seed &s;own on the &s;tony Ground &s;pring up quickly; but on the contrary, did not the good Ground bring forth Fruit with Patience? Did not the poor Man in the Go&s;pel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vail his Unbelief? And are we not commanded to fight <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Fight of Faith? If we will believe the Scriptures, does not their Conver&s;ion and Experiences look like Pre&s;umption and Delu&s;ion? Their gro&s;s Ignorance about the Nature of a true and &s;aving Faith, adds awful Weight to what has been now ob&s;erved!</P>
<P>I wonder not at their Ea&s;e, when I con&s;ider what Sort of Faith pa&s;&s;es for &s;aving among them; and &s;eeing they lay &s;o much Stre&s;s upon an hi&s;torical or temporary Faith, and reject the Law of God, by which is the Knowledge of Sin; how can they be otherwi&s;e than ea&s;y? for without the Law Sin is dead, as to our Apprehen&s;ion and Feeling; i.e. we have no true Sight and Sen&s;e of the Evil and Danger of Sin without the Law.</P>
<P>As to the Spirit of the Moravians; Do not a Number of them &s;eem to be proud under a Mask of Humility; while
<PB N="104" REF="005299_0111_1016F80C010F87B8">
they look upon them&s;elves and their Party, to be more ad|vanced in Grace, than Per&s;ons of any other Denomination? How will &s;uch a Spirit accord with the Example of <HI>Paul,</HI> who look'd upon him&s;elf to be far le&s;s than the lea&s;t of all Saints? and with the Command of God, that every Man &s;hould e&s;teem another better than him&s;elf?</P>
<P>Are not the Moravians many of them uncharitable and divi&s;ive in their Speech and Practice, and that under a pre|text of Charity &amp; Catholici&s;m? Witne&s;s Mr. <HI>Spangenberg</HI>'s comparing the Prote&s;tant Churches to a Babel, and the Count's calling their Conver&s;ion by the Law a Delu&s;ion? (before mentioned;) Witne&s;s their not being willing to join with any Prote&s;tant Body of Men, and yet their receiving Per&s;ons of diver&s;e Societies to their Fellow&s;hip, with little Examination as to their Principles.</P>
<P>Do not tho&s;e Things, together with their &s;ending of their ignorant Mi&s;&s;ionaries to gather &s;eparate Societies in Places, where there is a &s;ound Mini&s;try, &s;ignify that their De&s;ign is not Catholick, whatever their Pretences be not|with&s;tanding?</P>
<P>The Count's bitter and contemptuous Speeches in <HI>New-Brun&s;wick,</HI> again&s;t the Body of the reformed Churches, gives additional Evidence, to what I have now ob&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>And is there no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> much Enthu&s;ia&s;m in the Moravian Method of Management, in the&s;e In&s;tances following; viz. in neglecting Family Prayer; in &s;ending out Mi&s;&s;ionaries, without human Learning; and in their Preaching (ordinarily) without Study, and without Prayer before or after, or both?</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, there is much cunning in their Practice, cloak'd with an Appearance of Simplicity, as is evident from the following Particulars, in their Method of propagating their Sect, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. They labour to be acquainted with others Principles, and accommodate them&s;elves &s;o far to them in Di&s;cour&s;e, as will not con&s;i&s;t with Truth. A late In&s;tance of this ap|peared in one of the Moravian Party called Mr. <HI>Betener,</HI> who in my hearing, expre&s;sly contradicted him&s;elf in the &s;pace of two or three Minutes; a Per&s;on of Di&s;tinction being pre|&s;ent. At fir&s;t be a&s;&s;erted that pious People could know
<PB N="105" REF="005299_0112_1016F80F3090C128">
others certainly, and offered &s;omewhat in Confirmation of that dete&s;table Notion, in An&s;wer to what was objected again&s;t it: but being a&s;ked by another Per&s;on after this Manner; You don't think that a good Man can know ano|ther infallibly? No, &s;aid he!</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, I have been inform'd by &s;ome Per&s;ons of Credit, that B. <HI>Wit&s;man</HI>'s Wife has denied &s;ince what &s;he a&s;&s;erted at <HI>New-Brun&s;wick:</HI> for this, if &s;he will &s;uffer the Matter to be examined, &s;he may be proved a Liar.</P>
<P>Farther, I am credibly informed, that the Count has in the hearing of &s;everal Per&s;ons, denied the Articles offered again&s;t him in the beginning of this Appendix, which he expre&s;&s;ed in <HI>New-Brun&s;wick,</HI> as they now &s;tand; and &s;ome of them ab&s;olutely and intirely. I leave it to the impartial Reader to judge, whether tho&s;e Articles be not proved by the Extracts of his Sermons; and hence to form what Opi|nion he thinks rea&s;onable, of the Count's Veracity. The Count's denying of them as they &s;tand, &s;eems to be an artful, but ungenerous Eva&s;ion. What if it was &s;o, that his A&s;&s;ertions were not put in the &s;ame Order in which he deli|vered them? if his Expre&s;&s;ions are not altered, or his Sen&s;e wronged, and the Articles be put in a more natural Order, where is the Injury?</P>
<P>I might mention more In&s;tances of other Moravians un|&s;incere and incon&s;i&s;tent Conduct; but the&s;e at pre&s;ent may &s;uffice.</P>
<P N="2">2. They hide any of their Principles, that they think will di&s;gu&s;t. I tho't it &s;omething &s;trange, in the Count's for|bidding any Per&s;on to come into the Room with me, the &s;econd Time I attempted to &s;ee him.</P>
<P N="3">3. They &s;peak &s;lightly of the U&s;e of good Books. This &s;eems to be a crafty Stratagem, to increa&s;e their Sect; for they may know, that all Books but their own are again&s;t them, con&s;idering their Principles complexly. Now their &s;lighting the U&s;e of good Books, has a Tendency to rob God's People, &s;o far as their Influence reaches, of a precious Mean of In&s;truction and Defence, and &s;o leaves them more expo&s;ed to the Stratagems of Seducers.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="106" REF="005299_0113_1016F813568A2828">4. Do not &s;ome Moravians, &s;light human Rea&s;on and Learning? which (if u&s;ed in their proper Place) are good Bulwarks again&s;t their incon&s;i&s;tent Doctrine: and in the Room thereof commend a Simplicity of dangerous Tendency, as has been before ob&s;erved? I know of no commendable Simplicity, but humility and &s;incerity in the U&s;e of proper Means; but to believe Contradictions is a dete&s;tible Sim|plicity, and to expect in ordinary Ca&s;es Ble&s;&s;ings from God, without the U&s;e of proper Means, in&s;tead of tru&s;ting in him, is to tempt him.</P>
<P N="5">5. Do not the Moravians &s;peak &s;lightly of Confe&s;&s;ions of Faith, and &s;uch like regular and harmonious Sy&s;tems of Chri&s;tian Principles? and is not this Political? for has it not a plain Tendency to prepare Per&s;ons to receive their incon&s;i&s;tent Medley of Doctrines, which no human Under|&s;tanding can harmonize.</P>
<P N="6">6. Don't the Moravians begin with the Affections fir&s;t? and is this fair Dealing? Do they not endeavour to in&s;i|nuate them&s;elves into People's Affections fir&s;t, by Smiles and &s;oft Di&s;cour&s;es about the Love of Chri&s;t, and by a &s;eem|ingly innocent &s;imple and loving Behaviour? while in the mean Time they carefully hide their Principles, until the Affections are catched, and then let them out by Degrees. Should not they &s;how their Principles fir&s;t, before the Affections are fir'd, that &s;o People might judge of them with Calmne&s;s and Impartiality?</P>
<P N="7">7. Do not they take &s;pecial Care to apply to young Per|&s;ons, Females, and ignorant People, who are full of Affection? And if any Per&s;ons of Di&s;tinction are under any good Im|pre&s;&s;ions, tho&s;e &s;hall be taken &s;pecial Notice of be &s;ure: for poor ignorant young Creatures under their fir&s;t Love, are ea&s;ily led a&s;ide by fair Shews. And there mu&s;t be if they can, &s;ome Per&s;ons of Note and Figure in every Place to grace their Sect, and gain Pro&s;elytes to it. Who do they imitate in attacking the weaker Part of Man, viz. the Pa&s;&s;ions; and the weaker Sex fir&s;t; but the Devil the Fa|ther of Lies and Errors? Did not he deal thus with our fir&s;t Parents, and by the weaker Sex &s;educ'd <HI>Adam.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="005299_0114_1016F817AAB27F08">And don't they refu&s;e generally to Rea&s;on upon Points in Religion, whereby one might convince another, and leave People to be pro&s;elyted by Sight only. It is politick in them indeed to wave Rea&s;oning and &s;hun Di&s;covery, for their Principles will bear neither. Let them but appear in their native Deformity, and they will be abhorred? My Soul is grieved to &s;ee the childi&s;h Ficklene&s;s of the Sons &amp; Daugh|ters of this Generation! who are to&s;&s;ed about with every Wind of Doctrine; who are ju&s;t &s;mil'd out of their Reli|gion, without being able to offer one &s;olid Rea&s;on for their Change.</P>
<P N="8">8. They endeavour to unhinge People as to their religi|ous Principles, with their confu&s;ed Invectives again&s;t Bi|gotry.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s to be as zealous in Degree, for &s;maller Points in Religion as for greater, is a criminal Bigotry; for Zeal &s;hould &s;urely be proportioned to the Weight of Things. Likewi&s;e to entertain uncharitable Thoughts of tho&s;e who differ from us, only in Circum&s;tantials; or &s;ome few le&s;&s;er Points of Faith: and no doubt to made Circum&s;tantials, Terms of Communion, is Bigotry with a Witne&s;s. Al&s;o to en|deavour rather principally to propagate a Sect by our Zeal, than to promote the general Intere&s;ts of Religion. But it is no Bigotry to hold fa&s;t Chri&s;t's precious Truths in Affection and Practice, and to defend them again&s;t all Oppo&s;ers; for this is but the Command of God. And without this a pretended Zeal for Holine&s;s is of no Moment. And we find our Lord and his Apo&s;tles u&s;ed Sharpne&s;s in dealing with fal&s;e Teachers, calling them Wolves, Dogs, Serpents, Vipers!</P>
<P>Indeed to e&s;&s;ay to impo&s;e our Opinion upon others, by Force and Violence, is doubtle&s;s a dete&s;table Bigotry; for every one has an equal Right to think for him&s;elf, and Rea|&s;on and Argument can only convince the Mind.</P>
<P>Certainly we &s;hould adhere inviolably to the Principles we have been in&s;tructed in, until we find better, which we &s;hould be always ready to receive upon proper Conviction; which is not to be attained by the Sight of the Grimaces of Strangers, or by immediate Revelations or Enthu&s;ia&s;ms, but
<PB N="108" REF="005299_0115_1016F81965E77208">
by Scripture, Rea&s;on and Argument. No doubt we &s;hould be always open to Light and rational Conviction; but there is a va&s;t Difference between this and a childi&s;h Ficklene&s;s. Do not tho&s;e act like Children and Fools, who part with good Principles for bad?</P>
<P>I think it looks exceeding black in the Moravians to &s;light &s;peculative Knowledge, &s;o as they do, which they call Head-Knowledge. It's true, it is a Sin to re&s;t &s;atisfied with it, without feeling its Power and Influence; but it is not an appointed Mean to obtain what is &s;aving; why el&s;e are the Unconverted enjoined to &s;earch the Scriptures? Without Knowledge <HI>Solomon</HI> ob&s;erves that the Mind cannot be good; and he &s;ays that they are Fools who hate it. Is not &s;pecu|lative Knowledge the &s;ame for Sub&s;tance with that which is &s;aving, only de&s;titute of its Influence upon Heart &amp; Practice? The Moravians by this Method of proceeding, are propa|gating another damnable Doctrine of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> namely, that Ignorance is the Mother of Devotion.</P>
<P>The Moravians &s;eem to be aware of this, <HI>viz.</HI> that Rea|&s;on, Learning, &s;ound Confe&s;&s;ions of Faith, and &s;peculative Knowledge, do all of them oppo&s;e the Spread of their per|ver&s;e incon&s;i&s;tent Principles, and therefore they labour to pull them down.</P>
<P>It is exceeding weak in the Moravians to bring in that Pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Paul,</HI> 1 Cor. 2.2. <HI>For I determined to know no|thing among you, &s;ave Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and him crucifyed;</HI> as an Objection again&s;t &s;eeking after Knowledge. We can|not rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e, that the Apo&s;tle means any more by that Pa&s;&s;age, than that he made Chri&s;t the Center and Scope of his Knowledge. i. e. that all he knew &s;hould have a Reference to Chri&s;t, either more direct or remote. And have not all the Scriptures this Tendency to exalt Chri&s;t, to bring Sinners to Chri&s;t, and to build them up in him? But to imagine that the Apo&s;tle &s;hould confine all his Knowledge to the Pa&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, in any other Sen&s;e, is contrary to Scripture and Rea&s;on. If &s;o, why did he inculcate &s;o many other Things in his preaching, and that by immediate In|&s;piration? If the afore&s;aid Notion were true, a great Part of the Bible would be u&s;ele&s;s. But were not the&s;e Things
<PB N="109" REF="005299_0116_1016F7E907CA81C0">
written for our Learning? Why are we bid to &s;earch the Scriptures, if we mu&s;t not labour to under&s;tand them. The following Place of Scripture, Act. 20.20, 21. and <HI>how I have kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have &s;hewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e; te&s;tifying to the Jews, and al&s;o to the Greeks, Repentance to|wards God, and Faith towards our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> may be a Help to explain the other. We can have no ju&s;t No|tion of the Pa&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, without the other Doctrines of Religion.</P>
<P>Does it look like the Spirit of Chri&s;t, that the Moravians in their Practice are &s;o carele&s;s of the &s;ecure World? What avail their Pretences to Love, while they weaken the Foun|dation of it, viz. Truth? What &s;ignifies a childi&s;h Affection, that is not grounded upon Truth and Rea&s;on?</P>
<P>Before I conclude, give me Leave to mention one In&s;tance more, of the &s;trange unaccountable Doctrine of this new Moravian Sect.</P>
<P><HI>Chri&s;topher Parleus,</HI> one of that Party, declared the fol|lowing Particulars, at the Hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>Samuel Hazard</HI> in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> in Pre&s;ence of him&s;elf and Spou&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. That he did not doubt, but that many who were not given to Chri&s;t or elected, would in Time be brought to accept of the Saviour.</P>
<P N="2">2. That there were others who were charitable, and who did not get the Pardon of their Sins in this World, would not|with&s;tanding get their Pardon in the next World: to prove which, he brought this Text; viz. <HI>Make to your &s;elves Friends of the Mammon of Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, that when ye fail, they may receive you into everla&s;ting Habitatio</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. He al&s;o &s;aid, that God was or might be di&s;appointed, in what he intended; and when this was objected again&s;t, he explained him&s;elf thus, viz. that God would not be finally di&s;appointed of an&s;wering the End he intended, tho' he might be di&s;appointed of an&s;wering that End by the fir&s;t or &s;econd Means, &amp;c. which he intended to an&s;wer it by.</P>
<P N="4">4. He al&s;o &s;aid, that the Moravians did not look upon Family Prayer to be a Duty.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="005299_0117_1016F820677E84F8">Here I may add, that Mr. <HI>Theodorus Frelinghau&s;a,</HI> heard the Count a&s;&s;ert, the &s;econd Article above&s;aid. And more|over adds, that the Count a&s;&s;erted, that many would be &s;aved at the Day of Judgment, by the Interce&s;&s;ion of the Saints, and that he him&s;elf expected to &s;ave Thou&s;ands.</P>
<P>But I am tir'd with relating their Abominations. I mu&s;t conclude by ob&s;erving, that their Principles tend to deceive Mankind, and fix the World in a fatal Security: they are directly contrary to Scripture, Rea&s;on, Experience, Antiquity, the Writings of the able&s;t and be&s;t Divines of the Prote&s;tant Churches, to the Harmony of their Confe&s;&s;i|ons of Faith, and to the Work of God. O may the GOD of Truth &s;ave his People from all &s;uch Deceivers, and de|te&s;table Delu&s;ions! <HI>Amen, Amen!</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Prie&s;thood of CHRIST con&s;idered.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>HEB. III. 1.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Wherefore holy Brethren, partakers of the heavenly Calling, con&s;ider the Apo&s;tle and high Prie&s;t of our Profe&s;&s;ion, Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE Apo&s;tle having in the preceeding Chap|ter, di&s;cours'd upon the prie&s;tly Office of Chri&s;t, doth in the beginning of this, ex|hort the believing Hebrews to a due Con|&s;ideration thereof.</P>
<P>In the Words before us, two Things require our Notice; namely, the Cha|racter given to the believing Hebrews, and the Duty to which they are exhorted.</P>
<P>The Character is threefold, or contains three Encomiums. (1) The Apo&s;tle calls them Brethren, partly to &s;hew his Conde&s;cen&s;ion and Love to them; as al&s;o to &s;ignify their Duty to each other, namely Love. Then, and never till then, do Chri&s;tians live like Brethren, when they exerci&s;e that Love to each other, which <HI>hopes all Things, which &s;uffers long and is kind, and is not ea&s;ily provoked, and &s;eeketh not her own Things.</HI> It is an a&s;toni&s;hing Stoop of Conde&s;cen&s;ion,
<PB N="2" REF="005299_0120_1016F8279A611CE0">
that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is not a&s;hamed, to call his poor People Brethren. (2) The Apo&s;tle calls the Hebrews holy; which they were not only by Profe&s;&s;ion and Dedication, but by Principle and Practice. (3) They are &s;aid to be Partakers of the heavenly Calling, i.e. they were effectually reclaimed from Sin to Piety, by the &s;pecial Call of God. Which is termed heavenly, becau&s;e of its Original, Tendency and I&s;&s;ue. The Original and Principle thereof, is the Spirit of God from Heaven; the Mean whereby we are called, the Word of God, is &s;piritual and heavenly; the Tendency and I&s;&s;ue of the Call is Heaven. The general Cour&s;e of the Affections of tho&s;e who are called, is towards Heaven, and there is their dwelling Place for ever.</P>
<P>In the Duty exhorted to, two Things may be ob&s;erved, namely the Act and Object, (1) The Act, <HI>con&s;ider:</HI> the ori|ginal Word &s;ignifies to animadvert, weigh, behold, ob&s;erve, and that with Care &amp; Diligence. (2) The Object, <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> the anointed Saviour, repre&s;ented by a twofold Character, namely that of an <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> and <HI>high Prie&s;t.</HI> The Word <HI>Apo&s;tle</HI> &s;ignifies one &s;ent: the Word <HI>high Prie&s;t</HI> &s;ignifies the Prince or Chief of tho&s;e, who&s;e proper Bu&s;ine&s;s it is to manage Things &s;acred. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was properly an Apo&s;tle, or Emba&s;&s;ador, and <HI>Aaron</HI> the chief Prie&s;t; but one JESUS has fulfilled the Part of both, and that to Perfection. The Word Profe&s;&s;ion in this Text, (as I conceive) by a Metonimy of the Adjunct, &s;ig|nifies the Religion we profe&s;s.</P>
<P>From the Words I ob&s;erve the following Propo&s;ition, namely <Q>That it is the Duty of all true Chri&s;tians, to con&s;ider <HI>JESUS CHRIST,</HI> as the Apo&s;tle and high Prie&s;t of their Pro|fe&s;&s;ion.</Q></P>
<P>In &s;peaking to the afore&s;aid Propo&s;ition, I would ob&s;erve the following Order; namely, 1. Di&s;cour&s;e upon the Apo&s;to|late, and Prie&s;thood of Chri&s;t. 2. Shew how we &s;hould con&s;ider them. 3. Why. And then proceed to the Im|provement of the Subject.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="005299_0121_1016F82A74131DA0">The fir&s;t General Head, is the Apo&s;tolate of our Lord.</P>
<P>An Apo&s;tle as was before ob&s;erved, &s;ignifies One &s;ent, a Me&s;&s;enger or Amba&s;&s;ador. Here therefore let us tran&s;iently ob&s;erve, in &s;ome In&s;tances, the Analogy between our Lord and &s;uch.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tles were immediately &s;ent by Chri&s;t, in&s;pir'd with Wi&s;dom to unvail the My&s;teries of Peace and Salva|tion, which had been long conceal'd, as well as endowed with Power to perform miraculous Works in Confirmation of them.</P>
<P>Thus our Saviour, who is the Wi&s;dom and Power of God, came not of him&s;elf, but the Father &s;ent him, to declare glad Tydings to the Poor; &mdash;and this Me&s;&s;age he confirmed not only by his Life, and Miracles, but by his Blood.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tles were to take Care of the Churches; and in Pur&s;uance hereof they travelled unweariedly from Place to Place, preaching the Go&s;pel, thro' good Report and bad Report, till they had fini&s;hed their Cour&s;e, and then com|mitted them&s;elves to him that judgeth righteou&s;ly.</P>
<P>Thus our Lord the great Apo&s;tle, bore upon his ble&s;&s;ed Bo&s;om, the Weight of the whole Church: in his humbled State, he travelled from Place to Place, indefatigably preach|ing the Go&s;pel, and doing Good; in the Face of all Oppo|&s;ition, Contempt and Danger, 'till he had compleated his Mediatorial Work, and could &s;ay, <HI>Father it is fini&s;hed, into thy Hands I commend my Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>An Emba&s;&s;ador or Me&s;&s;enger of Peace from a Prince, is not only a Per&s;on of Honour, Integrity, and Skill; who is concerned to negociate in Matters of greate&s;t Con&s;e|quence, to the Weal or Wo of Nations, but is com|mi&s;&s;ioned by the Prince that &s;ends him, whom in his Em|ba&s;&s;y he repre&s;ents.</P>
<P>And is not our Lord a Per&s;on of the highe&s;t Renown and Dignity, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a Retinue of innumerable Angels? The faith|ful and true Witne&s;s, the wonderful Coun&s;eller? Has not this Apo&s;tle, this Me&s;&s;enger of the Covenant, come from Heaven to Earth, with an Emba&s;&s;y of Peace and Salvation, which un&s;peakably concerns our everla&s;ting Weal? Him
<PB N="4" REF="005299_0122_1016F82D4B9AB018">
hath God the Father &s;ealed, and by him is the Per&s;on of the Father repre&s;ented. So that he who <HI>honoureth the Son, honoureth the Father al&s;o.</HI></P>
<P>A Me&s;&s;enger or Amba&s;&s;ador, is &s;ometimes &s;ent to put an End to War, that hereby the di&s;mal Con&s;equences thereof, may be prevented: To this Purpo&s;e, he is to make Propo|&s;als of Peace, on certain Terms, which he is ve&s;ted with a Power to ratify.</P>
<P>Has not our Lord by his Go&s;pel, made Propo&s;als of Peace and Pardon, to the vile&s;t Rebels, upon equal and honoura|ble Terms, viz. of Faith and Repentance, that hereby the unju&s;t and unequal War, commenc'd again&s;t God by <HI>Adam</HI>'s Apo&s;tacy may be i&s;&s;ued, and &s;o the damning Con&s;equences of Rebellion prevented; and are not the afore&s;aid Pro|po&s;als ratified by the Mediator's Blood?</P>
<P>A Me&s;&s;enger is apt to be grieved, when his Me&s;&s;age is &s;lighted, upon the Fore&s;ight of the Calamities con&s;equent hereupon, for when the Treaty of Peace expires, a Scene of De&s;olation and Blood opens!</P>
<P>Thus when our compa&s;&s;ionate Apo&s;tle, drew near to the City of Jeru&s;alem, he wept over it, &s;aying, <HI>If thou had&s;t known in this thy Day, the Things that concerned thy Peace, but now they are hid from thine Eyes!</HI> O will it not be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the Day of the Lord, than for tho&s;e, who ungratefully &s;light the gra|cious Offers of this Me&s;&s;enger of the Covenant, this A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tle of our Profe&s;&s;ion!</P>
<P>When Amba&s;&s;adors have faithfully delivered their Emba&s;&s;y, are they not at their Return, received with Honour? Thus with what inexpre&s;&s;ible Honours and Acclamations of Joy, was our dear Lord received by the heavenly Ho&s;ts, when he a&s;cended up on high, and led Captivity Captive! Did not all the pro&s;trate Ranks of Saints and Seraphims, ca&s;t their Crowns at the Feet of our Immanuel on this Occa&s;ion? who was &s;et at the right Hand of the Maje&s;ty on high, cloathed with all the En&s;igns of Power, Greatne&s;s and Glory!</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="005299_0123_1016F82EDA5977D8">But I proceed to Di&s;cour&s;e upon the Prie&s;thood of Chri&s;t, That our Lord is a Prie&s;t, is evident from the Oath of God the Father, P&s;al. 110.4. <HI>The Lord hath &s;worn, and will not repent, thou art a Prie&s;t for ever, after the Order of Melchi&s;e|deck.</HI> Hence he is called our Ran&s;om, Propitiation, Pa&s;&s;over, and Advocate with the Father.</P>
<P>And hence have we &s;o many Types of his prie&s;tly Office. The common <HI>Levitical Prie&s;ts,</HI> were Figures of him; in their teaching of the People the Knowledge of the Law, <HI>Mal.</HI> 2.7. In their &s;ounding of the Trumpets, either as an Alarm to War, or to a&s;&s;emble the People.</P>
<P>Thus our Lord &s;ounds the Go&s;pel Trumpet as an Alarm to &s;piritual War here, and will make the Arch-Angel's Trumpet &s;nake the Creation hereafter, to form the la&s;t Grand A&s;&s;ize.</P>
<P>But the Prie&s;ts were e&s;pecially Figures of him, in offer|ing Sacrifices for the Sins of the People, and in judging of the Plague of Lepro&s;y, and &s;o pronouncing them clean and unclean. If it had reach'd the Head, the Per&s;on was to be pronounced unclean. So truly it is an awful Sign of a bad State, when Errors about important Points of Doctrine corrupt the Judgment. As our Lord gave him&s;elf a Sa|crifice for Sin, &s;o he is the final Judge of the Plague of every Man's Heart.</P>
<P><HI>Melchi&s;edeck</HI> was doubtle&s;s a Type of our Lord, in his be|ing called the King of Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Peace. The&s;e repre&s;ented the everla&s;ting Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Peace, which the Redeemer introduced, and procured by his Blood and Obedience. <HI>Melchi&s;edeck</HI> ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Abram,</HI> and received Tyths of him, by which was doubtle&s;s &s;ignified, the &s;upe|rior Excellency of the Prie&s;thood of Chri&s;t, to the Levitical. <HI>Melchi&s;edeck</HI> had no Predece&s;&s;or or Succe&s;&s;or in his Office, and his Age and Genealogy was de&s;ignedly concealed, to &s;ig|nify the ineffable Generation and eternal Duration of Chri&s;t, as al&s;o that he had no Rivals or Succe&s;&s;ors in his prie&s;tly Office.</P>
<P>But the high Prie&s;t was an illu&s;trious Type of Chri&s;t, in the following In&s;tances.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="6" REF="005299_0124_1016F83314930F30">1. In Re&s;pect of his Call to his Office: He took not this Honour to him&s;elf, but was call'd of God and con&s;e|crated by Impo&s;ition of Hands, <HI>Heb.</HI> 5.4. <HI>Numb.</HI> 8.10. Thus our Lord glorified not him&s;elf, <HI>Heb.</HI> 5.5. but was &s;ealed or commi&s;&s;ioned by his Father, <HI>Joh.</HI> 6.27.</P>
<P N="2">2. In his Unction for his Office: <HI>Lev.</HI> 8.12. and was not our Lord anointed with the Oyl of Gladne&s;s, above his Fellows?</P>
<P N="3">3. In his peculiar Ornaments, namely his holy Crown, his Mitre, Girdle, and Brea&s;t-Plate: All which typified the tran&s;cendent Excellency of Chri&s;t's Prie&s;thood!</P>
<P N="4">4. The high Prie&s;t's bearing the Names of the twelve Tribes on his Brea&s;t-Plate, when he appeared before God, &s;eems to repre&s;ent the affectionate Remembrance our Lord hath of his whole Church, when he intercedes for them with his Father. The <HI>Urim</HI> and <HI>Thummim</HI> on the Brea&s;t-Plate, &s;ignifying Light and Integrity, was doubtle&s;s a Figure of the Sufficiency of Chri&s;t's Prophetical Office, to an&s;wer all the Difficulties of his People.</P>
<P N="5">5. The high Prie&s;t's yearly entrance into the Holy of Holies, and that not without Blood, to make Atonement, doubtle&s;s prefigured our Lord's Entrance into Heaven, as Mediator for us, in Vertue of his meritorious Blood, to make Atonement for all his Elect, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.12.</P>
<P N="6">6. The high Prie&s;t's being without Blemi&s;h, and the Cleanne&s;s of his Robes, <HI>Lev.</HI> 21. &s;hadowed forth the un|&s;potted Purity of our high Prie&s;t Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who was holy, harmle&s;s, undefiled.&mdash;</P>
<P N="7">7. As the high Prie&s;t only made Perfume, for burnt Offerings, &s;o it is Chri&s;t alone who by the Incen&s;e of his Merits, can perfume our Devotions, and render them ac|ceptable to God, <HI>Rev.</HI> 8.3.</P>
<P N="8">8. The high Prie&s;t's Death, &s;et the Man-&s;layer free, who had fled to the City of Refuge: and does not the Death of our great high Prie&s;t &s;et all tho&s;e guilty Creatures free, who fly to him for Shelter? <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 32.1, 2.</P>
<P>Now the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Prie&s;thood of Chri&s;t, will appear by con&s;idering,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="7" REF="005299_0125_1016F835E2684210">1. The Wrong that by Sin is offered to the divine Ma|je&s;ty: it being a Contempt of his Authority, an under|valuing of his Mercy, and a Contrariety to all the Perfecti|ons of his Nature, as well as Precepts of his Law.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is a Nece&s;&s;ity of making Satisfaction for the Wrong done by Sin, becau&s;e of the governing Ju&s;tice, Wi&s;dom, and Truth of God. Sin becau&s;e of its vile Na|ture, de&s;erves Puni&s;hment; and it is contrary to the divine Wi&s;dom to di&s;pen&s;e with it, without Satisfaction made; becau&s;e this tends to de&s;troy all Government.</P>
<P>In order to Government there mu&s;t be Laws, and that enforced by proper Sanctions; but unle&s;s the Sanctions or Penalties be executed upon Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, they are but in|&s;ignificant Scare-crows. But the Almighty is obliged by his Truth, to inflict the Penalty of Death annexed to the Breach of the fir&s;t Covenant, either upon the Sinner him|&s;elf, or a Surety in his Room and Place. I add,</P>
<P N="3">3. That there is an utter Inability in Man, to make Satisfaction to divine Ju&s;tice, either by doing or &s;uffering. His Performances, thro' an inherent and univer&s;al Depra|vity of Nature, are imperfect and due to God, on the Ac|count of Creation, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 64.6. Now what is &s;inful it &s;elf can never make Satisfaction for Sin. The Payment of Debt we owe as Creatures, can never pay another Debt, which we owe as Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors. And if Man &s;atisfies by Suffering, it mu&s;t be by &s;uch as is infinite, in Weight or Continuance, for le&s;s is not equal to the Demerit of Sin, which is objectively infinite, and what is le&s;s than its De|merit, a ju&s;t God will not accept of. Now a Puni&s;hment infinite in Weight, would cru&s;h a finite Creature to no|thing; and if it be infinite in Continuance, it will make it for ever mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>The Prie&s;thood of Chri&s;t, is that Mediatorial Office of our Lord, whereby he offers him&s;elf, as a propitiatory Sa|crifice for Sin, interceeds for his People, and ble&s;&s;eth them.</P>
<P>The</P>
<P N="1">1. Act of Chri&s;t's Prie&s;tly Office, is to <HI>offer Sacrifice for Sin</HI> (Heb. 5.3.10.14.) namely, &s;uch in which God might re&s;t, and for which, he might be reconciled to the
<PB N="8" REF="005299_0126_1016F838B1651C70">
Sinner. Here let it be con&s;idered, that the Per&s;on offering, was the Mediator God-Man, according to both Natures. (2) The Sacrifice offered, was him&s;elf, properly as to his human Nature; hence it is a&s;crib'd to his Body, his Blood, his Soul. (3) The Altar was him&s;elf, con&s;idered as to his divine Nature: for as from the Altar, &s;prings the Value and Efficacy of the Sacrifice, &s;o on the Deity of Chri&s;t, the Dig|nity &amp; Influence of his Death depends. (4) The End of the Offering is Satisfaction; that by transferring the Guilt upon the Sacrifice, the Sinner may be freed and thus reconcil'd to the divine Maje&s;ty. This Offering our high Prie&s;t has at once fini&s;hed by his Crucifixion, <HI>Heb.</HI> 9.26. The</P>
<P N="2">2. Act of Chri&s;t's Prie&s;thood, is his <HI>Interce&s;&s;ion</HI> with the Father for his People. To intercede in general &s;ignifies to plead with one for another; and this is twofold, either out of Charity as Brethren, or by Virtue of Office. The lat|ter is peculiar to our Lord, who by Virtue of his Office, pleads for his People again&s;t all their Enemies, as well as for the Acceptance of their Per&s;ons and Services, the Con|tinuance of their Peace, and Satisfaction of their De&s;ires.</P>
<P>Of the Interce&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, there are two Periods, the fir&s;t of which was when he was on Earth, <HI>Joh.</HI> 17. then did he with the greate&s;t Humility and Fervour, de&s;ire Ble&s;|&s;ings for his People; the &s;econd is in Heaven, which he performs with the greate&s;t Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) By appearing before his Father for us, as the high Prie&s;t in the Holy of Holies, with the Names of the twelve Tribes upon his Brea&s;t-Plate.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) By repre&s;enting his Satisfaction and Merits, that on the Account thereof, his People and their &s;piritual Sacrifi|ces may be accepted in his Father's Sight. Hence he is &s;aid to appear <HI>as the Lamb &s;lain.</HI></P>
<P>Now the Interce&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t is gracious, general, pre|valent, perpetual. He pleads without any Reward from us. He pleads for all his without Exception, and him the Father always heareth: Hence his Blood is &s;aid <HI>to &s;peak better Things than that of Abel;</HI> and that <HI>he lives for ever to make Interce&s;&s;ion for his People.</HI> The Holy Spirit does indeed interceed by his Operations in us, thereby &s;tirring up unutterable Groan|ings;
<PB N="9" REF="005299_0127_1016F83A38746098">
but Chri&s;t without us by his Blood and Obedience.</P>
<P>The</P>
<P N="3">3. Act of Chri&s;t's prie&s;tly Office, is <HI>Benediction.</HI> Hence the Prie&s;ts of old, by divine Pre&s;cription, ble&s;&s;ed their Peo|ple; and <HI>Melchi&s;edeck</HI> ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Abram:</HI> and hence we are inform'd, that in his Seed (which is our high Prie&s;t) all Na|tions &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed, and thus the Ble&s;&s;ing of <HI>Abraham</HI> is &s;aid to come upon the Gentiles thro' <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> (Gal. 3.14.) i. e. the &s;ame Ble&s;&s;ing which God confer'd on <HI>Abraham,</HI> in Kind, on the Account of the ble&s;&s;ed Seed, which did de&s;cend lineally from him. Hence our Lord after his Re&s;urrection, ble&s;&s;ed his Di&s;ciples, &s;peaking Peace to them. And hence God the Father is &s;aid to ble&s;s his People with all &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings in him, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.3.</P>
<P>Sometimes to ble&s;s &s;ignifies to Prai&s;e, and give Thanks; and thus we ble&s;s God: &s;ometimes to wi&s;h Pro&s;perity; and thus Parents ble&s;s their Children, Pa&s;tors their People, and each the other: Sometimes to &s;eparate to a religious U&s;e; and thus God ble&s;&s;ed the Sabbath; and &s;o the &s;acramental Elements, after Con&s;ecration, may be &s;aid to be ble&s;&s;ed. Once more, it &s;ignifies to confer every Kind of Benefit which we need; in this Sen&s;e the Gentiles are &s;aid to be ble&s;&s;ed in Chri&s;t. And in this la&s;t Sen&s;e of the Word it is that our Lord as a Prie&s;t ble&s;&s;es his People.</P>
<P N="1">1. With all &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings, namely Redemption, Ju&s;tification, Sanctification, Adoption, Covenant-Commu|nion with him here, and eternal Glory hereafter. And</P>
<P N="2">2. With all &s;uch temporal Mercies as are for their be&s;t Good. Even the&s;e are included in the Ble&s;&s;ing of <HI>Abraham,</HI> which thro' Chri&s;t is derived on the Gentiles. Godline&s;s hath the Promi&s;e of this Life, as well as that to come.</P>
<P>The</P>
<P><HI>Second</HI> general Head of Di&s;cour&s;e, is to &s;hew how we &s;hould con&s;ider Chri&s;t, as our Apo&s;tle and high Prie&s;t.</P>
<P N="1">1. We ought to con&s;ider him as &s;uch attentively, parti|cularly, frequently; often weighing in our Minds with Care, the ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity, the tran&s;cendent Excellency, and un&s;peakable U&s;e and Benefit, of his Apo&s;tle&s;hip and Prie&s;thood.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="10" REF="005299_0128_1016F83D52157888">2. We &s;hould con&s;ider our Lord as an Apo&s;tle and Prie&s;t affectionately, with Wonder and Gratitude. O how amaz|ing was the concordant Di&s;cord, the friendly Conte&s;t, among the divine Attributes, about the Salvation of fallen Man! Avenging Ju&s;tice required of the Sinner eternal Condemna|tion for his Offence; the Demands of Ju&s;tice the Truth of God engaged to i&s;&s;ue, and urg'd the Execution of the pri|mitive Threatning, Death of every Kind. On the con|trary, Grace and Mercy contended for the Sinner's Safety and Happine&s;s, the Plea of which was &s;trengthned by the Glory that would redound to the divine Goodne&s;s and Cle|mency hereby; which delights not in the Death of a Sinner, but rather that he may turn and live. Here un&s;earchable and divine Wi&s;dom interpo&s;ed, and offered to give Satis|faction to both the contending Parties thus; namely, in ordering that Sin &s;hould be puni&s;hed according to Ju&s;tice, and yet the Sinner be &s;aved according to Mercy.</P>
<P>To this End divine Wi&s;dom pointed to our high Prie&s;t, who by his Death and Obedience &s;hould &s;atisfy Ju&s;tice, and &s;ave the Sinner; who is hence called the Wi&s;dom and Power of God, for in him divine Wi&s;dom and Power have had a mo&s;t glorious Di&s;play&punc; In him Grace and Truth have met together, and Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Peace have ki&s;&s;ed each other. O &s;hould not the&s;e Things fill us with Amazment, when the Angels &s;toop down to behold this wondrous Scene! And &s;hould not our Souls be in&s;pir'd with the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate Gratitude, when we con&s;ider the awful Maje&s;ty, un&s;tained Purity, glorious Sovereignty, and inexhau&s;ted All-&s;ufficiency of that Jehovah, who gave &s;uch a high Prie&s;t to the World! &mdash;As al&s;o the Character and Quality of the Per&s;on he gave: Not a Levitical, Aaronical Prie&s;t, but One according to the Order of <HI>Melchi&s;edeck:</HI> Not a Stranger but a Son, an only begotten and eternal Son; who is able to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t all that come to the Father by him. Add to this, the Manner of the Gift; the eternal Father gave his only Son, with the Solemnity of an Oath, to &s;ignify the Immutability of his Coun&s;el, as well as the &s;uperiour Excellency of the Prie&s;thood of Chri&s;t, that hereby his Peo|ple might have &s;trong Con&s;olation.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="005299_0129_1016F84173B5C718">But if we con&s;ider for whom, and for what, the Son of God was given to be a Prie&s;t by his Father, it may increa&s;e our Admiration. Was it not for Worms, Sinners, Ene|mies, as unworthy of his Love, as unable to requite it? And was not this the De&s;ign of his Prie&s;thood, that he might reconcile &s;uch, even &s;uch to God, and vouch&s;afe all Ble&s;|&s;ings on them? O the amazing Heights and Depths of the Love of God in Chri&s;t, which pa&s;&s;es all Knowledge; herein is Love, not that we loved him, but that he loved us, and gave his only begotten Son to be a Propitiation for us.</P>
<P>And what Gratitude &s;hould fire our Bo&s;oms, when we con&s;ider the Conde&s;cention and Love of Chri&s;t, as an Apo&s;tle? When this Apo&s;tle trod our du&s;ky Globe, then was the legal Vail rent in twain, the Day-Spring from on high did vi&s;it us, and the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hone upon us. The Jewi&s;h Shades vani&s;hed and expired, at the opening of the Go&s;pel-Day, in the Charms of its meridian Beauty and brighte&s;t Radiancy.</P>
<P N="3">3. We &s;hould con&s;ider Chri&s;t as our Apo&s;tle and high Prie&s;t effectually, &s;o as to di&s;claim all Dependance upon our own Wi&s;dom, and Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and with Readine&s;s and Reverence embrace him for Direction and Forgivene&s;s; we &s;hould continually depend upon him, and re&s;ign all our Affairs to his Conduct and Di&s;po&s;al.</P>
<P>The</P>
<P><HI>Third</HI> general Head is to &s;hew, why we &s;hould con&s;ider Chri&s;t as an Apo&s;tle and high Prie&s;t.</P>
<P N="1">1. The commanding Authority of God obliges us, which it is ungrateful rebellious and exceeding perilous for us to di&s;pute or di&s;obey: <HI>Wherefore holy Brethren, Partakers of the heavenly Calling, con&s;ider the Apo&s;tle and high Prie&s;t of our Profe&s;&s;ion Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Our Comfort and Intere&s;t &s;hould invite us: Chri&s;t is the Spring of Sweetne&s;s, and Con&s;olation; but without an attentive believing Con&s;ideration upon him, how can we expect Comfort from him, which we &s;o much need in our pre&s;ent Pilgrimage? Chri&s;t is the Fountain and Trea&s;ury of all Fulne&s;s, not only e&s;&s;entially as God, but by divine Con|&s;titution as Mediator, without Communications from which,
<PB N="12" REF="005299_0130_1016F8444544C910">
we can make no religious Progre&s;s. And can &s;uch be ex|pected, without con&s;idering him from whom they are de|rived?</P>
<P N="3">3. Our U&s;efulne&s;s in the World does much depend upon our con&s;idering of Chri&s;t. <HI>This, this</HI> is a proper Mean, to increa&s;e our Love to, and excite our Joy in him; and the&s;e will doubtle&s;s incline to proportionable Labours for him. But when Chri&s;t is neglected, our Joy faints, our Love lan|gui&s;hes; and then no wonder if our religious Labours are le&s;&s;ened.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="improvement">
<HEAD>The IMPROVEMENT of this Subject remains.</HEAD>
<P>And</P>
<P N="1">1. Hence we may learn the great, the gro&s;s Ignorance, which Sin brought Mankind to, who needed an Apo&s;tle, &s;uch an Apo&s;tle, to in&s;truct them; this was &s;o great, that un|converted Sinners are call'd Darkne&s;s it &s;elf, in the very Ab&s;tract, <HI>Eph.</HI> 5.8.</P>
<P N="2">2. Hence we may learn the Love of God the Father in &s;ending &s;uch an Apo&s;tle, to teach poor Sinners the Way to Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s; and to govern and e&s;tabli&s;h the Church.</P>
<P>And does not the Love of the Son of God appear con|&s;picuous in this, that he left the Glories of Paradi&s;e, and willingly became an Apo&s;tle, a Fellow-Servant, in order to in&s;truct the Poor and Ignorant! <HI>Ye know the Grace of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that tho' he was rich, yet for our &s;akes he became poor, that we thro' his Poverty, might be made Rich.</HI></P>
<P>From the Prie&s;thood of Chri&s;t we may learn the &s;infulne&s;s of Sin, which has &s;o alienated us from God, that a Prie&s;t, a Reconciler for us with him, became ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and that not of the common Order. Such was the Guilt which our Sins contracted, that neither the Blood of Bulls nor of Goats could expiate it, nothing le&s;s than the Blood of the immaculate Lamb of God. Such was the Stain which Sin bro't on all our &s;acred Services, that they became odious to God; and thus an Interce&s;&s;or was nece&s;&s;ary, to perfume them with his meritorious Righteou&s;ne&s;s; without which they cannot be accepted. Sin has robbed us of every Ble&s;&s;ing, of every Kind; &s;o that a high Prie&s;t was nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="13" REF="005299_0131_1016F84715639DD0">
to ble&s;s us, and to derive the Ble&s;&s;ing of <HI>Abraham</HI> on us. Sin has &s;o armed the Law, the Ju&s;tice, and Power of God again&s;t us, that nothing le&s;s than the accur&s;ed Death and the Obedience of the Son of God, can reconcile us to him, and &s;creen us from de&s;erved Vengeance. Is it not Sin that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;t the Angels out of Heaven, &amp; <HI>Adam</HI> out of Paradi&s;e? Was it not this, that burnt the Cities of the Plain by a fiery Shower, and buried the whole Earth by a Deluge of Water?

Well, if Sin be &s;o great an Evil, let us hate, bewail and &s;hun it, and &s;eek Recon|ciliation by the Blood and Obedience of our high Prie&s;t.</P>
<P>But in the mean Time, it is highly nece&s;&s;ary that we inquire, whether Chri&s;t Je&s;us be <HI>our</HI> Apo&s;tle, <HI>our</HI> high Prie&s;t. To this Purpo&s;e let me ask you, in the Pre&s;ence of God, whether ever you have had the Law and Go&s;pel opened to your Minds with clearne&s;s, and &s;et home on your Hearts with Power by this Apo&s;tle?</P>
<P>Has the Law di&s;covered to you God's Maje&s;ty, Ju&s;tice, Almightine&s;s, as well as your own Unbelief, Enmity again&s;t God, and other Iniquities in Heart and Life, in their Num|ber and Aggravations? Has the Law applied, di&s;covered to you your condemned lo&s;t State, and your utter want of Wi&s;dom and Power to get out of it? And has a near View of the&s;e Things, together with their dreadful Con&s;equences in another World, &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ed you that you could not re&s;t; until the Go&s;pel opened a Door of Hope in Chri&s;t, until ye heard and felt the glad Tydings thereof, accom|panied with &s;urprizing Light, efficacious Energy, and over|coming Sweetne&s;s, &s;o that ye were made willing under a Sen&s;e of your Sin and Nothingne&s;s, to venture your &s;ick Souls by believing upon the Almighty Saviour, and him alone, having di&s;claimed all other Refuges?</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle &s;ugge&s;ts &s;ome Things in our Text, which may help us to know, whether Je&s;us Chri&s;t be our high Prie&s;t. Namely (1) That &s;uch Per&s;ons are holy, i. e. the general Cour&s;e of their De&s;ires and Endeavours bends that Way from love to God and his Law. (2) They are Bre|thren,
<PB N="14" REF="005299_0132_1016F84A14FF36B0">
they love each other, with that Love which &s;uffers long, and is kind. They love chiefly becau&s;e of the Image of God, and in Proportion thereto, and this Love is not confined to their own Party. (3) They are Partakers of the heavenly Calling; i. e. they have heard the Voice of God, by his Law and Go&s;pel, &s;o as to be rai&s;ed hereby from a Death in Sin, to a divine Life, to a Conformity to the Image of the Son of God, that he might be the fir&s;t born among many Brethren, and particularly &s;uch &s;et their Affections on Things above, (<HI>Col.</HI> 3.1.) and are habitually in the prevailing Temper of their Minds, Pilgrims and Strangers on this Earth. (4) They are of the Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ion, and that not in Name only but Thing. Such are not a&s;hamed to confe&s;s Chri&s;t, and profe&s;s his Religion at all Times, and in all Places.</P>
<P>Now to tho&s;e who have experienced the afore&s;aid Particu|lars, the Subject I have been di&s;cour&s;ing on, offers great Con&s;olation and Support. The Apo&s;tle&s;hip of Chri&s;t opens a Spring of Sweetne&s;s to &s;uch as are oppre&s;&s;ed with a Sen&s;e of their Ignorance; who apprehend them&s;elves to be as brute-Bea&s;ts, upon that Account. Such may con&s;ider, that Chri&s;t as an Apo&s;tle, is a conde&s;cending powerful In&s;tructor, who makes the Heart of the ra&s;h to under&s;tand Judgment, and the Tongue of the Stammerer to &s;peak plain. He makes the Simple under&s;tand Wi&s;dom, and writes his Laws upon their Hearts, with indelible Characters, &s;o that they become his Epi&s;tle.</P>
<P>And does not the Prie&s;thood of Chri&s;t open a comfort|ing Scene to poor Believers, under all the Variety of their Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and that in it's &s;everal Acts? As may appear thus.</P>
<P>When Sin urges, when the Law, Con&s;cience, and Satan accu&s;e; when we walk in Darkne&s;s, and &s;ee no Light; when we are di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with the Fears of private or publick Judgments here, and eternal Condemnation hereafter: In the&s;e, and in all other Calamities, how &s;weet and &s;up|porting is it, to con&s;ider that we have a high Prie&s;t, who has offered not the Blood of Bulls or of Goats, but him|&s;elf, his Soul, his Body, his Blood, to reconcile us to God;

a Prie&s;t after the Order of <HI>Melchi&s;edeck,</HI> the King of Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, and of Peace; the Son of God, God-Man, yea God him&s;elf!

<P>When we are almo&s;t di&s;couraged, becau&s;e of the Dead|ne&s;s, Wandrings, and other Impurities of our Devotions; likewi&s;e when we are di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with Fears of falling away, it yields a great Support to con&s;ider upon the Interce&s;&s;ion of our high Prie&s;t with his Father for us, which is authorita|tive, continual, prevailing, Joh. 17.24. <HI>Father, I will that tho&s;e whom thou ha&s;t given me, be with me where I am.</HI> Heb. 7.25. <HI>Seeing he ever lives, to make Interce&s;&s;ion for them.</HI> Joh. 11.42. <HI>And I knew that thou heare&s;t me always.</HI> There|fore let us offer our Prayers believingly in his Name, and &s;eek to have them perfumed with the Incen&s;e of his Merit and Interce&s;&s;ion: let us with humble Confidence, commit our whole Ca&s;e to be intirely manag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by this gracious and faithful Advocate.</P>

<P>Let us be exhorted to hear the great Apo&s;tle of our Profe&s;&s;ion, &s;eeing that his Father hath &s;ent him, and com|mands us to hear him, Matth. 17.5. <HI>This is my beloved Son, hear ye him.</HI> Surely never Man &s;pake like him;

<P>Let us therefore &s;peedily accept of the Terms of Grace, which this Me&s;&s;enger of the Covenant propo&s;es to us; for &s;urely we cannot maintain a War again&s;t him. Shall Stub|ble contend with the devouring Flames? Have we an Arm like God; or can we Thunder with a Voice like him Who can &s;tand before his Indignation? Who knows the Power of his Anger?

<P>Con&s;ider, poor Sinners! how unju&s;t and ungrateful your War again&s;t Heaven is. Is not Jehovah Je&s;us your right|ful Sovereign?

<P>And &s;hould not we be induced to perform the Offices we owe to our high Prie&s;t? namely, Honour, Love, Obedi|ence, Homage and Support.</P>
<P>We owe Honour to &s;uch a Prie&s;t, &s;uitable to his Dignity: this <HI>Abraham</HI> expre&s;&s;ed to him in <HI>Melchi&s;edeck.</HI></P>
<P>Likewi&s;e Love is due to him as a Father, as a Prie&s;t; &s;o faithful and merciful, that he has given him&s;elf to us, and in him&s;elf all Ble&s;&s;ings to us.</P>
<P>We &s;hould perform Obedience and Homage al&s;o to him, as to a kingly Prie&s;t, of whom <HI>Melchi&s;edeck</HI> was but a Type.</P>
<P>Another Duty is Support, (as it were in Tythes) mini|&s;tred not to his Per&s;on, but to his indigent Members and Me&s;&s;engers.

<P>_LOVE is certainly the brighte&s;t Emblem of the divine Nature, for God is Love; and the greate&s;t Ornament of the human. Love is the Sinew of civil Society, and religious al&s;o, without which the Comforts and Profits of both, are either much impair'd or intirely lo&s;t. Love is the Sub&s;tance of the Law, and the great Scope of the glorious Go&s;pel. All the pure Precepts of the one, and conde&s;cending Directions of the other, tend to Love, and end in it. This is the royal Law, <HI>Jam.</HI> 2.8. <HI>If ye fulfil the royal Law according to the Scripture, thou &s;halt love thy Neighbour as thy &s;elf, ye do well.</HI> The Bond of Perfection and Badge of Chri&s;tianity. By this our Lord ob&s;erves, that his true Di&s;ciples may be di&s;tingui&s;h'd from vain Pretenders. Joh. 13.35. <HI>By this &s;hall all Men know that ye are my Di&s;ciples, if ye have Love one to another.</HI> Love is the noble&s;t Image of the heavenly State: There all angry Debates &amp; unhappy Contentions are for ever bani&s;hed:
<PB N="20" REF="005299_0138_1016F85CD4006068">
There the &s;tronge&s;t Affection, and the &s;weete&s;t Concord, do for ever triumph: What unfailing Vigour and unfading Glory!</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle plainly points out the va&s;t Importance of this noble Grace, in the Words immediately preceeding our Text; where he ob&s;erves, that the noble&s;t Attainments of Knowledge and Eloquence, yea even of the Gift of Prophe&s;ying, and miraculous Faith, without Charity or Love, as the Word may be well rendered, would be no Evidences of his being a true Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>In di&s;cour&s;ing upon this important Subject, I &s;hall &s;peak of the Nature, Kinds, Ingredients, and Effects of Charity; and then proceed to the Improvement. And</P>
<P N="1">1. Charity may be more generally de&s;cribed thus, viz. that it is the Propen&s;ion or Inclination of the Heart or Will toward our Neighbour.</P>
<P N="2">2. It may be thus di&s;tingui&s;h'd, namely that it is either carnal, natural, civil, or chri&s;tian.</P>
<P N="1">(1) Carnal is that &s;ordid, &s;hameful, and &s;inful Pa&s;&s;ion after forbidden Embraces, which &s;prings from lawle&s;s Lu&s;t. This, without Repentance intervene, will plunge the Nocent in perpetual Ruin. This di&s;honours our Nature, reproaches our Religion, and will damn our Souls. 1 Cor. 6.9. <HI>Know ye not that the Unrighteous &s;hall not inherit the Kingdom of God, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2) Natural, is a Regard which re&s;pects Children and Parents, which even the Bea&s;ts have &s;omething of; for the want o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> which the Gentiles are reproved, Rom. 1.31. <HI>Without Under&s;tanding, Covenant-breakers; without natural Affection, implacable, unmerciful.</HI></P>
<P N="3">(3) Civil, is that Affection which is only grounded upon civil Cau&s;es; when Men re&s;pect one another as Men, or as cloathed with civil Offices, or for Kindne&s;&s;es received.</P>
<P N="4">(4) Chri&s;tian, is that whereby Chri&s;tians are re&s;pected for their Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>It is the two la&s;t Kinds of Charity that I intend to di&s;|cour&s;e upon.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="005299_0139_1016F85E5B82A5F8">In the De&s;cription which I gave of Charity, I ob&s;erved, that it was the Inclination of the Heart towards our Neigh|bour: Now by Neighbour is to be under&s;tood every Man upon whom we can confer any Good. Luk. 10.29, 37. <HI>But he, willing to ju&s;tify him&s;elf, &s;aid unto Je&s;us. And who is my Neighbour? And he &s;aid, he that &s;hewed Mercy on him. Then &s;aid Je&s;us unto him, Go, and do thou likewi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>The Order of this Charity is &s;uch, that &s;eeing God is the primary and principal Object of Love, he is therefore the formal Rea&s;on of that Charity which we owe to our Neighbour. Next therefore after God we are to love our Selves, with that Charity which re&s;pects true Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. By loving God with a Love of Union, we immediately love our &s;elves, with that Charity which intends &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s; and others as it were &s;econdarily, whom we would have partake with us of that &s;upreme Good. Now albeit none are to be excluded from our Charity, yet it is not to be extended in a like Degree to all. It is true indeed in Regard of the Good, which we &s;hould wi&s;h to our Neighbour, there is no Imparity; becau&s;e we &s;hould de&s;ire that the chief Good may be conferred on all, as upon our &s;elves; and that with the &s;ame Seriou&s;ne&s;s and Sincerity; yet there &s;hould be a Difference in the Mea&s;ure and Fruits of our Charity, according to the Difference of Per&s;ons, and Occa&s;ions it is to be exerci&s;ed upon. Tho&s;e that fear God are to be loved above others. Gal. 6.10. <HI>As we have therefore Opportunity, let us do Good unto all Men, e&s;pecially unto them who are of the Hou&s;hold of Faith.</HI> A peculiar Regard is due to our Relations, above Strangers; and that in Proportion to the Nearne&s;s of the Relation; which &s;hould manife&s;t it &s;elf according to the Nature of the Relation: If the Relation be corporal, principally in outward Things; if &s;piritual, principally in &s;piritual Things. The</P>
<P><HI>Third</HI> general Head, is to &s;peak of the Ingredients of Charity; which I think are the&s;e four, <HI>viz.</HI> E&s;teem, De|&s;ire, Delight, Sorrow. And</P>
<P N="1">1. Charity includes <HI>E&s;teem.</HI> A rational Affection follows our e&s;teeming or valuing any Per&s;on or Thing, for &s;ome real or &s;uppo&s;ed Excellency or Good we conceive to be
<PB N="22" REF="005299_0140_1016F85FE98F8E90">
in them. That which hath neither phy&s;ical nor moral Good in it or annexed to it, cannot be the Object of E&s;teem; and that which we have no E&s;teem of, we can have no Charity for. Now tho' there be various Kinds &amp; Degrees of Excellency in our Fellow-Creatures, for which a pro|portionable Re&s;pect is due from us; yet there is none but who hath &s;uch a Mea&s;ure of Good either natural or moral, as de&s;erves our E&s;teem. The very wor&s;t of Men have im|mortal Souls, endowed with the noble Powers of Rea&s;on and Reflection, by which they re&s;emble the infinite Knowlege, and &s;piritual Nature of the &s;upreme Being: for <HI>there is a Spirit in Man, and the In&s;piration of the Almighty giveth them Under&s;tanding;</HI> as <HI>Job</HI> ob&s;erves. By this they are ca|pable, thro' the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of divine Grace, to know and enjoy God. They are al&s;o our Brethren by Nature, for God hath made of one Blood all Nations. Upon the&s;e Accounts we ought to e&s;teem and value the very meane&s;t of the rational Creation, becau&s;e they are the Workman|&s;hip of God, and bear his Similitude: There are al&s;o additional Excellencies, to excite our E&s;teem for &s;ome, in who&s;e Lives &s;hine many moral Virtues. Why therefore &s;hould we &s;et at nought our Brethren? And as to the People of God, they claim our Charity upon other Accounts: By Regeneration they are adorn'd with the moral Image of God; by Adop|tion they are admitted to the mo&s;t valuable Priviledges; hereby they become the Children of God, and our Bre|thren by Grace, as well as Heirs of an inexpre&s;&s;ibly rich and everla&s;ting Inheritance. Should we then have a light E&s;teem of any of tho&s;e Sons of God, becau&s;e of accidental Differences? O no! What if &s;ome have not &s;o much natural Abilities or acquired Learning as &s;ome others? yet the meane&s;t of them has Wi&s;dom to Salvation; and &s;urely this is infinitely better than all the Knowlege of the World. Oh! the compa&s;&s;ionate Prophet of the Church of God, makes the Simple to under&s;tand Wi&s;dom; He cau&s;es the Heart of the ra&s;h to under&s;tand Judgment! What if they are poor in this World, this al&s;o flows from a Father's Love, and &s;hall be made by the Power of God to increa&s;e their &s;piritual and eternal Riches: Their moral Blemi&s;hes
<PB N="23" REF="005299_0141_1016F8640CBE3118">
&s;hould excite our Pity &amp; Compa&s;&s;ion. We are commanded to prefer others before our &s;elves: and to this End we &s;hould be careful to ob&s;erve their Excellencies, while blind to our own.</P>
<P N="2">2. Charity includes an unfeigned and earne&s;t De&s;ire, after our Neighbour's Good, temporal, &s;piritual and eter|nal. Thus the Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> de&s;ired the pre&s;ent Pro&s;|perity of his beloved <HI>Gaius,</HI> 3 Epi&s;t. 2 ver. <HI>Beloved, I wi&s;h above all Things that thou may&s;t pro&s;per and be in Health, even as thy Soul pro&s;pereth.</HI> Thus the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> affectio|nately thir&s;ted after the temporal and eternal Weal, of the <HI>Philippians</HI> and <HI>Hebrews,</HI> Phil. 1.8, 9. <HI>For God is my Record, how greatly I long after you all, in the Bowels of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And this I pray, that your Love may abound yet more &amp; more, in Knowledge, and in all Judgment.</HI> See al&s;o Rom. 10.1. <HI>Brethren, my Heart's De&s;ire and Prayer to God for I&s;rael is, that they may be &s;aved.</HI> Now, tho' we &s;hould wi&s;h without Di&s;|gui&s;e, that all the afore&s;aid Kinds of Good &s;hould be con|fer'd upon our Brethren, yet it ought to be with different Degrees of Inten&s;ene&s;s, according to their different Degrees of Nece&s;&s;ity and Excellency. We &s;hould undoubtedly be tender of their Characters and bodily Welfare; yet we &s;hould with greater Vehemence de&s;ire for them more dura|ble and valuable Enjoyments, namely tho&s;e that are &s;piritual and eternal. The afore&s;aid De&s;ire after our Brethren's Be|nefit, is by &s;ome call'd a Love of Benevolence.</P>
<P N="3">3. Charity includes a Delight or Satisfaction in our Neighbour's Good, which by &s;ome is call'd a Love of Com|placence. Joy and Complacence naturally follow the Ful|filment of our De&s;ires, and that in Proportion to their De|grees of Inten&s;ene&s;s. The charitable Per&s;on (in the gene|ral Cour&s;e of his Life) is &s;o far from envying his Neigh|bour's honourable Character, &s;hining Gifts, pro&s;perous Succe&s;&s;es, and increa&s;ing Graces, that he is really pleas'd therewith according to their different Degrees of Impor|tance. As one Member of the Body &s;en&s;ibly feels the Plea&s;ure another more immediately enjoys, and is therewith delighted. But the Conver&s;ion of Sinners to the ble&s;&s;ed God and their progre&s;s in Goodne&s;s, is peculiarly plea&s;ing
<PB N="24" REF="005299_0142_1016F866DBA652C8">
to charitable and generous Souls! O this makes them exult with joyous Triumphs, re&s;embling the angelic Ho&s;ts; who al&s;o rejoyce upon the like Occa&s;ion! Luk. 15.7, 10. <HI>I &s;ay unto you, that likewi&s;e Joy &s;hall be in Heaven over one Sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety &amp; nine ju&s;t Per&s;ons that need no Repentance. Likewi&s;e I &s;ay unto you, there is Joy in the Pre&s;ence of the Angels of God, over one Sinner that repenteth.</HI> Of this noble Temper was the ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul:</HI> O how did the Tho'ts of the <HI>Philippians</HI> Conver&s;ion, gladden his Heart with an en|during Plea&s;ure! Phil. 1.3, 4, 5. <HI>I thank my God upon every Remembrance of you, always in every Prayer of mine for you all, making Reque&s;t with Joy.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Charity includes a Sorrow for our Neighbour's Mi&s;ery, Which &s;ome call a Love of Condolence. Now this Sorrow is in &s;ome Mea&s;ure &s;uited or proportioned to the Kind of Mi&s;eries, we behold them labouring under, as well as to the Degrees of our De&s;ire after their Welfare. It is the Duty, the Temper and Practice of charitable Per&s;ons, not only to rejoyce with tho&s;e that rejoyce, but al&s;o to weep with tho&s;e that weep, <HI>Rom.</HI> 12.15. As one pained Member of the Body afflicts the re&s;t, &s;o charitable Per|&s;ons are pa&s;&s;ionately affected with beholding others Mi&s;|fortunes. The Sufferings of Per&s;ons in their Names, Bo|dies and E&s;tates, open the Springs of their Sorrow. This was the Practice of <HI>Job,</HI> Chap. 30. 25. <HI>Did not I weep for him that was in Trouble? was not my Soul grieved for the Poor?</HI> Of this Temper of Mind was the P&s;almi&s;t al&s;o, and that even towards his Enemies, P&s;al. 35.12, 13, 14. <HI>They re|warded me Evil for Good, to the &s;poiling of my Soul; but as for me, when they were &s;ick, my cloathing was Sackcloth: I humbled my Soul with Fa&s;ting.&mdash;I behaved my &s;elf as tho' he had been my Friend; I bowed down heavily, as one that mourn|eth for his Mother.</HI> Hereto we may add the noble Example of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI>'s univer&s;al and unwearied Sympathy, mentioned, 2 Cor. 11.29. <HI>Who is weak, and I am not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">? who is offended, and I burn not?</HI> As well as that of our Lord, Mat. 14.14. where it is &s;aid, <HI>And Je&s;us went forth, and &s;aw a great Multitude, and was moved with Com|pa&s;&s;ion towards them, and he healed their Sick.</HI> The original

Word &s;ignifies the tendere&s;t and mo&s;t compa&s;&s;ionate Com|motion, even in his very Bowels, upon their Account. But that which e&s;pecially excites the &s;adde&s;t Sorrows of charitable Per&s;ons, is the Con&s;ideration of their Neighbour's &s;piritual Mi&s;eries, and the Pro&s;pect of the eternal Pains, which are like to follow upon them. O! it breaks their Hearts and makes their Bowels bleed, to behold their poor Fellow-Creatures in a State of Wrath and Cour&s;e of Sin! Rivers of Waters ran down the P&s;almi&s;t's Eyes upon this Account, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 119.136. He <HI>beheld Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors and was grieved, becau&s;e they kept not God's Word,</HI> Ver. 158. The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> a&s;&s;ures us in the mo&s;t &s;olemn Manner, that he had great Heavine&s;s and continual Sorrow in his Heart, on the Account of his unhappy ob&s;tinate and ungrateful Countrymen, for who&s;e Salvation he could be willing him&s;elf to be accur&s;ed from Chri&s;t, if that could &s;ecure it, Rom. 9.1, 2, 3. <HI>I &s;ay the Truth in Chri&s;t, I lie not; my Con&s;cience bearing me Witne&s;s in the holy Gho&s;t, that I have Heavine&s;s and continual Sorrow in my Heart; for I could wi&s;h that my &s;elf were accur&s;ed from Chri&s;t, for my Brethren, my Kin&s;men ac|cording to the Fle&s;h.</HI> The Love of our dear Redeemer was &s;uch as to incline him to be a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with Grief, that he might atone for the Offences of his People: and in particular how afflicting are tho&s;e In&s;tances of our Saviour's compa&s;&s;ionate Charity to the Souls of Sin|ners, which we find mentioned, Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 3.5. <HI>And when he had looked round about with Anger, being griev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for the Hard|ne&s;s of their Hearts, he &s;aith unto the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch forth thine Hand: And he &s;tretched it out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was re|&s;tored whole as the other.</HI> And Lu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> 9.41. <HI>And when he was come near he beheld the City, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> wept over it.</HI> And how endearing is the Love of the ble&s;&s;ed God him&s;elf, who&s;e Mercies are &s;aid to be above all his other Works!

<P>I proceed to the</P>
<P><HI>Fourth</HI> General Head, which was to di&s;cour&s;e of the Effects of Charity. And</P>
<P N="1">1. Charity inclines to kind candid and favourable Sen|timents of our Neighbour's Per&s;on and Actions, &s;o far as their Nature and Circum&s;tances can in Rea&s;on admit. It thinketh no Evil; but on the contrary, hopeth all Things, and believeth all Things that are Good: It bani&s;hes all ill-natur'd In&s;inuations of our Neighbour's Speeches, Actions, and De&s;igns; and puts the faire&s;t and mo&s;t favourable Sen&s;e upon them that can con&s;i&s;t with Rea&s;on: in&s;tead of expo&s;ing and aggravating real Weakne&s;&s;es, without urgent Nece&s;&s;ity; it rather hides and extenuates them, and rea|dily offers any Excu&s;e or Apology that can be thought per|tinent to that generous and truly noble Purpo&s;e. O how generous and precious is this Effect! and how &s;ub&s;ervient to the Peace, Weal and Comfort of Society! But Lord, how contrary is the Practice of a great Part of this ill-natur'd and unhappy World, who can hardly invent any Thing cruel enough (to their Mind) under the Umbrage of their Neighbours real or &s;uppo&s;ed Mi&s;carriages, to blacken and ruin their Reputation.</P>
<P N="2">2. Charity inclines to Mildne&s;s, Candor and Courte&s;y in Speech and Behaviour. It <HI>behaveth not it &s;elf un&s;eemly;</HI> as the Apo&s;tle ob&s;erves in this Chapter: 'It's Language is not cruel and clowni&s;h, but candid and courteous.' And there|fore, as the &s;ame Apo&s;tle ob&s;erves, <HI>it is not ea&s;ily provoked, but &s;uffereth long, and endureth all Things:</HI> It inclines us to po&s;&s;e&s;s our Souls in Patience under injurious Treatment, and to re&s;train and bury our angry Re&s;entments. Hence we are inform'd, that <HI>many Waters cannot quench Love, nor the
<PB N="27" REF="005299_0145_1016F86E6D570288">
Floods drown it,</HI> Cant. 8.7.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> And hence we are entreated, Eph. 4.2. to <HI>walk with all Lowline&s;s and Meekne&s;s, with Long-&s;uffering, forbearing one another in Love.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Charity makes it's Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or ready upon all Occa&s;ions, to do his Neighbour Good. Hence we are commanded, <HI>not to love in Word and Tongue</HI> (only) <HI>but in Deed and Truth.</HI> Therefore the Apo&s;tle ob&s;erves in the 6th Ver&s;e of this Chap|ter, that <HI>Charity is kind;</HI> and truly &s;o it is, to the Souls and Bodies of Men. And</P>
<P N="1">(1) The charitable Per&s;on labours to do Good to his Neighbour's Soul, morally, by propo&s;ing of Good to be performed by him with &s;uitable Motives and Directions, by which he may be brought to it, either by teaching if he is ignorant, or comforting if afflicted, or by Rea&s;oning and Reproof if he errs in Principle or Practice, or by examin|ing if he is ignorant of his &s;piritual State, or by exhorting if he is &s;lothful in doing Good, and e&s;pecially by a good Example exciting to do the like.</P>
<P N="2">(2) The charitable Per&s;on endeavours to do Good to his Neighbour's Body, phy&s;ically, by &s;uch Acts of Kindne&s;s and Beneficence, as have a Tendency thereto. Heb. 13.16. <HI>To do Good and communicate forget not, for with &s;uch Sacrifices God is well plea&s;ed.</HI> <Q>The charitable Per&s;on is liberal in his Kindne&s;s, as the Sun of his Light and Influence; and when his outward Ability fails, it is more than made up by the generous Sentiments and Wi&s;hes of his Soul, as well as Endeavours of his Life, in pre&s;&s;ing others to Beneficence.</Q>
True Charity will incline us to <HI>loo&s;e the Bands of Wickedne&s;s, undo the heavy Burdens, and let the oppre&s;&s;ed go free;</HI> to <HI>draw out our Soul to the hungry, and &s;atisfy the afflicted Soul,</HI> I&s;ai. 58.6, 10.</P>
<P>Here let me mention for Illu&s;tration-&s;ake a few Exam|ples. And</P>
<P N="1">(1) That of <HI>Job</HI> is memorable, <HI>Chap.</HI> 29.11,&mdash;17. (2) That of our Saviour who went about doing Good to the Souls and Bodies of Men. He in&s;tructed the ignorant, com|forted the &s;orrowful, healed the di&s;ea&s;ed, and fed the hun|gry; and that &s;ometimes at the Expence of Miracles. The Apo&s;tles al&s;o endeavoured to &s;uccour Men under out|ward
<PB N="28" REF="005299_0146_1016F8714180A0D8">
Mi&s;eries; which appears by the Collection for the poor Saints at Jeru&s;alem, which they forwarded: But their Charity was e&s;pecially fixed upon Men's precious Souls; in which Re&s;pects tho' they them&s;elves were poor in Tempo|rals, yet they made many rich in Spirituals, by their un|wearied Labours.</P>
<P N="4">4. Charity prefers the publick Good to a private Intere&s;t. Hence the Apo&s;tle ob&s;erves in the 5th Ver&s;e of this Chapter, that <HI>Charity &s;eeks not her own Things.</HI> i. e. neither only nor principally. <Q>Charity enlarges and ennobles the Mind of Man, and reduces the whole World within the Compa&s;s of its Care, in Compari&s;on of which any Per&s;on's private Intere&s;t is as incon&s;iderable, as one Man compared with the whole World. And as it is &s;o in it &s;elf, thus it is al&s;o in the E&s;teem of the truly charitable Per&s;on, who&s;e noble Soul is &s;ublimated by generous Love, above the &s;ordid Sphere of &s;elfi&s;h Con&s;iderations, to de&s;ire and &s;eek with Sincerity, &s;o far as he hath Opportunity, and Capacity, the Good of his whole Species.</Q>
And this indeed is no more than what the great God requires of us, 1 Cor. 10.24. <HI>Let no Man &s;eek his own: but every Man another's Wealth.</HI> And Phil. 2.4. <HI>Look not every Man on his own Things, but every Man al&s;o on the Things of others.</HI> And e&s;pecially the publick and valuable Intere&s;ts of the Church of God are very dear to charitable Per&s;ons. The P&s;almi&s;t expre&s;&s;es his Concern that Way, to the following Effect; <HI>If I forget thee O Jeru&s;alem, let my right Hand forget her Cunning, if Jeru&s;alem be not my chief Joy.</HI></P>
<P>In order to promote our Neighbours Good, Charity in|clines to Self-denial and Conde&s;cen&s;ion. To compa&s;s the &s;pi|ritual and eternal Good of Mankind, the charitable Apo&s;tles freely laid down their Honours and Intere&s;ts, their Liberties and Lives: They pa&s;s'd thro' Di&s;honour and evil Report, being generally accounted the Filth of the World, and the Off-&s;couring of all Things; they were &s;trip'd of all the Ea&s;e and Emoluments of human Life; expo&s;ed to Hunger and Nakedne&s;s, Scourging, Bonds and Impri&s;on|ments; and in the mean Time cover'd with a Cloud of Reproach and Ignominy; in Perils, Travels, Labours and
<PB N="29" REF="005299_0147_1016F87422C13F50">
Watchings, often; and at la&s;t expo&s;ed to cruel Deaths. And yet all this they couragiou&s;ly undertook, and patiently endured, in order to &s;pread the Redeemer's Go&s;pel, and &s;ave the Souls of Men from eternal Ruin. It is ju&s;tly ob&s;erved concerning them, even under their many Troubles, that tho' they were &s;orrowing, yet they were always rejoycing, and tho' they were poor, yet they made many rich. The Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> &s;hews the Greatne&s;s of his Conde&s;cen&s;ion in the following Places of Scripture, 1 Cor. 9.19. <HI>For tho' I be free from all Men, yet have I made my &s;elf Servant unto all, that I might gain the more.</HI> To the &s;ame noble Pur|po&s;e he further ob&s;erves in the &s;ame Chapter, <HI>That to the Jews he became a Jew;</HI> and <HI>to tho&s;e that were without Law, as without Law.</HI> And in the la&s;t Ver&s;e of the afore&s;aid Chapter, he &s;ays, <HI>Even as I plea&s;e all. Men in all Things, not &s;eeking mine own Profit, but the Profit of many, that they may be &s;aved.</HI> And this the Apo&s;tle pre&s;cribes as a Rule to others, Rom. 15.1, 2. <HI>We then that are &s;trong ought to bear the Infirmities of the Weak, and not to plea&s;e our &s;elves. Let every one of us plea&s;e his Neighbour for his Good to Edification.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Charity inclines tho&s;e that po&s;&s;e&s;s it to Humility&punc; Hence it's &s;aid in the 4th Ver&s;e of this Chapter, <HI>that Charity vaunteth not it&s;elf, is not puff'd up.</HI> No! it's &s;o far from this, that charitable Per&s;ons are willing to do the meane&s;t Offices, that may &s;erve the Intere&s;ts of their Friends. Charity inclines the greate&s;t Souls and noble&s;t Beings, freely to &s;erve their Inferiours. It was this that inclined the Apo&s;tles to becomes the Slaves of Men, as it were, in order to &s;ecure their everla&s;ting Intere&s;ts. It is this that inclines the holy Angels, tho&s;e Principalities and Powers, to mini&s;ter to the Saints of God, in this Wilderne&s;s, that they may guide and guard them to Glory. 'Twas this that inclin'd the innocent honourable and eternal Son of God, to leave his Father's Bo&s;om, and &s;toop as low as Earth, by uniting it to his Deity; hereby his divine Glory was for a Time ob&s;cured, and the Son of God a&s;&s;um'd the Form of a Servant, was made a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with Grief; hereby he who was rich in all his Father's e&s;&s;ential Excellencies, became poor, that we thro' his Poverty might
<PB N="30" REF="005299_0148_1016F878707019C8">
be rich. 'Twas Charity inclin'd him to wa&s;h his Di&s;ciples Feet for our Example; and to lay down his precious Life to purcha&s;e their Salvation. It's Charity that inclines the great God him&s;elf, who inhabiteth Eternity, to dwell in the humble Heart, (<HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 57.15.) to humble him&s;elf to behold the Things that are done in Heaven and Earth; to take &s;uch gracious and continual Care in pre&s;erving of, pro|viding for, and bearing with, &s;uch mean Du&s;t as we!</P>
<P>Why therefore having &s;uch noble Examples, &s;hould we not &s;erve one another by Love? (<HI>Gal.</HI> 5.13.) and conde|&s;cend to Men of low Degree, in performing the humble&s;t Offices that may &s;erve their Intere&s;t, or &s;upply their Ne|ce&s;&s;ity!</P>
<P>Hence we may learn, 1. The Excellency of the Chri&s;tian Religion; the Scope of which is to inculcate that Virtue of Charity, which is as con&s;onant to the moral Perfections of the divine Nature, as it is conducive to promote the Good of Society.</P>
<P N="2">2. Seeing Charity is the great Character of true Chri&s;tia|nity, without which we can have no rea&s;onable Claim thereto, 1 Joh. 3.14, 15. <HI>He that hateth his Brother is a Murderer</HI>&mdash;. And Ver. 17. <HI>But who&s;o hath this World's Goods, and &s;eeth his Brother have Need, and &s;hutteth up his Bowels of Compa&s;&s;ion from him; how dwelleth the Love of God in him?</HI> 1 Joh. 4.20. <HI>If a Man &s;ay, I love God, and hateth his Brother, he is a Lyar</HI>&mdash;: We &s;hould be therefore invited to examine our &s;elves, whether we have the afore&s;aid Ingredients and Effects of Love, <HI>viz.</HI> &s;uch E&s;teem, De&s;ire, Delight, Sorrow; &s;uch favourable Sentiments of Mind, Courte&s;y in Speech and Carriage, Beneficence and Kindne&s;s in Action; a preferring of the publick Good to our pri|vate Intere&s;ts, Self-Denial and Conde&s;cention in promoting it; and Humility. To the&s;e, for a further Di&s;covery of our State, I &s;hall add a few more Characters of Chri&s;tian Charity, by which let us try our &s;elves. And</P>
<P N="1">1. True Charity to Man &s;prings from the Love of God, and is exerci&s;ed with a Regard to his commanding Authority. Love to God, where it is &s;pecial and tran&s;cendent, will ne|ce&s;&s;arily con&s;train us to love our Brethren.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="31" REF="005299_0149_1016F87B89C2F660">2. It e&s;pecially eyes the moral Image of God in Man, and is proportioned to the Degrees it perceives thereof to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in them. Tho' the charitable Per&s;on loves the wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> rational Creation with a Love of Benevolence, and as Occa&s;ion &s;erves with a Love of Beneficence; yet he al&s;o re&s;pects pious Souls with a Love of &s;pecial Complacence. The&s;e are the excellent Ones of the Earth, in whom is all his Delight: and as he loves all that are truly Good, whatever Denomination they bear, peculiarly and &s;incerely; &s;o according to the Degrees of their Goodne&s;s, is his E&s;teem and Love increa&s;ed.</P>
<P N="3">3. True Charity will not only di&s;po&s;e to do our Neigh|bour Good in Temporals and Spirituals, but al&s;o to bear with his Weakne&s;&s;es.&mdash;Tho&s;e who can ju&s;tly apply to them|&s;elves the&s;e Signs of Chri&s;tian Charity, may be comforted in this, that their Love is an Evidence of their gracious State, and Communion with the divine Maje&s;ty. 1 Joh. 2.10. <HI>He that loveth his Brother, abideth in the Light,</HI>&mdash; And Chap. 4. 16. <HI>God is Love; and he that dwelleth in Love, dwelleth in God.</HI> In the mean Time, it ought to be ob&s;erved, that we have no &s;ufficient Rea&s;on to think Per&s;ons to be &s;piritually Good, unle&s;s they be &s;ound in the main doctrinal Principles of Religion: for &s;urely Truth is the Foundation of real Holine&s;s, without which all Appearances of Piety, how great &s;oever, may be rea|&s;onably &s;u&s;pected. But alas, is there not Rea&s;on to lament it, if it were po&s;&s;ible with Tears of Blood, that the very contrary to what has been now expre&s;s'd, too generally prevails among &s;ome, who profe&s;s the &s;ame ble&s;&s;ed Truths of God.</P>
<P>I proceed to a U&s;e of EXHORTATION.</P>
<P>O let us all be intreated to &s;eek after the Truth, In|crea&s;e, and Exerci&s;e of this noble Grace of Love and Charity, in it's whole Extent and utmo&s;t Latitude; and that for the following Con&s;iderations.</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e this Commandment we have from God, <HI>that he who loveth him, &s;hould love his Brother al&s;o.</HI> 1 Joh. 4.21. Should not this have &s;ome Influence upon us, who are his Creatures; who have deriv'd our Beings from his

Almighty Power, and all our Ble&s;&s;ings from his gracious Providence, and who&s;e Lives and Happine&s;s depend on his Favour!</P>
<P N="2">2. Such is the Excellency of Charity, that it is the very Sum and Fulfilment of the Law of God, the very Soul and Spring of all the Duties we owe to our Neighbour. So that not one of them can be genuine and acceptable, unle&s;s it proceed from Charity. Gal. 5.14. <HI>For all the Law is fulfilled in one Word, even in this, Thou &s;halt love thy Neigh|bour as thy &s;elf.</HI> <Q>Charity (&s;aith a learned Writer) gives Worth Form and Life to all Vertues; &s;o that without it no Action is valuable in it &s;elf, or acceptable to God. Sever it from Courage, and what is that but the Boldne&s;s and Fiercene&s;s of a Bea&s;t? from Meekne&s;s, and what is that but the Softne&s;s of a Woman, or Weakne&s;s of a Child? from Courte&s;y, and what is that but Affectation or Artifice? from Ju&s;tice, and what is that, but Humour or Policy? from Wi&s;dom, and what is that but Craft and Subtilty? what meaneth Faith without it, but dry Opinion? what Hope, but blind Pre&s;umption? what Alms-Doing, but ambitious O&s;tentation? what under|going Martyrdom, but Stiffne&s;s and Sturdine&s;s of Re&s;olu|tion? What is Devotion, but glo&s;&s;ing and mocking with God? What is any Practice, how &s;pecious &s;oever, in Appearance, or materially Good, but an I&s;&s;ue of Self-conceit, or Self-will, of &s;ervile Fear, or mercenary De|&s;ign?</Q>
Thus far he. But</P>
<P N="3">3. Charity is of &s;uch ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity, that without it we mu&s;t expect to peri&s;h to all Eternity. 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.15.</P>
<P N="4">4. Charity is ju&s;t and rea&s;onable; as may appear by the following Particulars,</P>
<P N="1">(1) There is &s;ome Propen&s;ity to it ari&s;ing from the very Frame of our Nature; which appears from the Power that Tragedies have over our &s;ofter Pa&s;&s;ions: Our Grief is &s;omewhat mov'd whether we will or not, when we hear of awful Accidents, that have befallen others, in which we our &s;elves are not at all concern'd; and much more when we behold them conflicting with uncommon Calamities! And no doubt the natural De&s;ire we have after Society, is partly
<PB N="33" REF="005299_0151_1016F87FE8209928">
owing to a Di&s;po&s;ition, that is in all Mankind, to commu|nicate Good to others. Hence ari&s;eth a Complacency of Mind upon our doing of Good to others, and an Unea&s;ine&s;s from the contrary. The Apo&s;tle confirms what has been ob&s;erv'd under this Head, Rom. 12.10. <HI>Be kindly affectioned</HI> (<GAP DESC="foreign">) which &s;uppo&s;eth that there is a natural Affection in Men, which it is our Duty to exerci&s;e and increa&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">(2) Every one is inclin'd to de&s;ire and expect Love from others, as a Debt due to them; and if it is not paid, they are apt to be offended. When we are under Reproach, Mi&s;ery and Want, we take it hard if Sympathy &amp; Succour is refus'd. This &s;hews plainly that according to our own Judgment, we owe the like to others in Extremity: for it is an unju&s;tifiable Weakne&s;s to expect or de&s;ire for our &s;elves, what we deny to others, who have as good a Right to Kindne&s;s as we. And this our ble&s;&s;ed Lord him&s;elf con|firms by that golden Rule of Love, which he has given for our Direction, Mat. 7.12. <HI>Therefore all Things what|&s;oever ye would that Men &s;hould do to you, do ye even &s;o to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets.</HI> Than which nothing can be more equal and rational.</P>
<P N="3">(3) <Q>All Men are Brethren and Repre&s;entatives, Parta|kers of the &s;ame Nature, Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the &s;ame Powers and Faculties, liable to the &s;ame Accidents, and &s;ubject to the &s;ame Laws. And is it not rea&s;onable to &s;hew Kindne&s;s to our Brethren, and to regard our own Pictures? and on the contrary mo&s;t unnatural and cruel to wrong either? But if we are true Chri&s;tians, there are additional Engagements upon us to exerci&s;e Charity to the People of God, &s;eeing they are with us Children of one Father, Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the &s;ame divine Nature, Pilgrims to the &s;ame Paradi&s;e, and Heirs to the &s;ame Inheritance, and thereby our Brethren in the noble&s;t Sen&s;e.</Q></P>
<P N="4">(4) Charity is an ea&s;y Duty, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly in Good-Will. <Q>Whence the poore&s;t Beggar is as able to perform it as the mightie&s;t Monarch: Tho' his Hand be not &s;o full of Alms, his Heart may be as full of Love.</Q> This is what God principally Re&s;pects, and what he will accept of when there is no Ability to &s;hew other Succour.

Mat. 10.42. <HI>And who&s;oever &s;hall give to drink unto one of the&s;e little Ones a Cup of cold Water only, in the Name of a Di&s;ciple, Verily I &s;ay unto you, he &s;hall in no wi&s;e lo&s;e his Reward.</HI> And indeed Cha|rity is the &s;ure&s;t and ea&s;ie&s;t Way of performing all tho&s;e Duties we owe to our Fellow-Creatures. <Q>If we would ha&s;ten through the Circle of Duty, let us Love, and all is done: Do we want to &s;erve God with Delight and Con&s;tancy, then let us Love.</Q>
For that is the only en|during Source of voluntary, &s;piritual and &s;teady Obedi|ence, other Motives are mean and mercenary, and do but produce an unwilling ignoble and in&s;table Service. Effects mu&s;t needs vary with their Cau&s;e: Now external &s;lavi&s;h and mercenary Motives to religious Action, are as incon&s;tant as the Wind; and therefore nothing that is &s;ta|ble can be expected from them. Do we want to be pre|pared for Suffering? O! then let us Love, and we &s;hall be willing to endure any Thing for Chri&s;t; for <HI>many Waters cannot quench Love.</HI> Do we want to make Progre&s;s in Holi|ne&s;s? O! then let us Love. That is the Sum of the Law, and Bond of Perfection.</P>
<P N="5">(5) Charity is plea&s;ing to God, not only in that it con|forms us to his moral Excellency, but al&s;o becau&s;e it is an Expre&s;&s;ion of our Love to him, when for his Sake we &s;hew Kindne&s;s to his Friends and Servants; and this he informs us he accepts of as done to him&s;elf, Mat. 25.34, 40.&mdash; <HI>Come ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the Foundation of the World. And the King &s;hall an&s;wer and &s;ay unto them, Verily I &s;ay unto you, in as much as ye have done it to one of the lea&s;t of the&s;e my Brethren, ye have done it unto me.</HI> And certainly the contrary Practice is a &s;lighting of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="35" REF="005299_0153_1016F8852AA586B8">6. Charity ennobles and perfects our Nature; <Q>adorns and beautifies our Souls, it inlarges the Mind of Man, and fills it with great and generous Projects, worthy of its Dignity and De&s;ign of being; it gra&s;ps the whole Univer&s;e in its kind Embraces, and aims at a univer&s;al and immortal Good.</Q></P>
<P>Charity likens us to the noble&s;t Creatures the Angels of God, tho&s;e glorious Nobles of the Court of Heaven, who with ince&s;&s;ant Delight labour to promote our Good, and that without any Hopes of Recompence from us; yea, Charity likens tho&s;e that are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it to the glorious God him&s;elf, who is the great Original of all Good and Excellency; who tho' he be infinite in Purity and Self-Sufficiency, and &s;o uncapable to receive any Benefit from his Creatures, who are unworthy of his Notice, and who&s;e Goodne&s;s extends not to him; does notwith&s;tanding freely vouch&s;afe innumerable and unwearied Benefits upon them, and bear with their Affronts and Offences. <Q>What is Charity but Goodne&s;s extending its kind Influence to pro|per Objects without low and &s;neaking De&s;igns? Such is its amiable and venerable Maje&s;ty, that it can't be beheld without Admiration. Wit, Power and Grandeur, without this are mean and ignoble, and what &s;ordid Creatures, namely Pagans, Turks, and Devils po&s;&s;e&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>On the contrary, Uncharitablene&s;s deba&s;es, degrades, and defiles the noble Soul of Man, by making Self the Center of all his Pur&s;uits; the Compa&s;s of all his Cares and Projects is meanly contracted to that pitiful Point: the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s of his Soul is to make Provi&s;ions for his Body, for this he acts like the crafty Fox, or cruel Wolf, u&s;ing either Fraud or Force to catch his Prey. Again,</P>
<P>Charity is exceeding advantageous, in as much as it pre|vents Strife and Contention, which flow from the contrary Di&s;po&s;ition: and are not Peace and Quiet de&s;irable Things? It al&s;o hath a natural Tendency to procure Friend&s;hip. Love is a Kind of Load&s;tone, which draws Per&s;ons by a gentle Violence to love us again; for who can with&s;tand the Charms of a generous Charity, that have the lea&s;t Remains of Humanity left in them? Again,</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="005299_0154_1016F88D41D521A8">Charity will &s;weeten every State of Life, and make them &s;afe and profitable: It will incline us to an&s;wer the De&s;ign of Pro&s;perity by &s;uccouring the Indigent, and yield Plea|&s;ure in &s;o doing; but temper'd with a View of our Neighbour's Calamity. It al&s;o helps in Adver&s;ity, not only by the Sweets of the divine Pre&s;ence, and inclining us to &s;ubmit to his &s;overeign Will, but by a Complacency in others Succe&s;&s;es. But Uncharitablene&s;s is the very Re|ver&s;e.</P>
<P><Q>Charity is indeed a &s;ure, ea&s;y and &s;afe Way, to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all good Things.</Q>
2 Cor. 6.10. <HI>As &s;or|rowful, yet always rejoycing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all Things.</HI> Does not your Neighbour's Wealth enrich you, if you feel Content in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it; and his Honour advance you, if you feel a Complacence in it? Neither is this Property only imaginary, but real; for how is Property in Things other|wi&s;e con&s;iderable, but for the Content it brings? Again,</P>
<P>Charity frees our Souls from tho&s;e gloomy Pa&s;&s;ions of Anger and Revenge, which eclip&s;e their Beauty, and di&s;turb their Peace, and &s;ettles the Mind in a &s;erene Calm, and keeps the lower Pa&s;&s;ions in a plea&s;ing Har|mony. Gal. 5.22. <HI>The Fruit of the Spirit is Love, Joy, Peace.</HI> If therefore we love our Selves, we mu&s;t love others, and do them Good. By Complacency we partake of their Plea&s;ures and Profits, whether they will or not; and by our Courte&s;y and Kindne&s;s, they will be inclin'd, unle&s;s they be Mon&s;ters of Ingratitude, to help us in Ex|tremity; and to live in Peace and Amity with us. Further|more, our Kindne&s;s to them is like to engage their Prayers in our Favour; which if they are pious, are of great Im|portance; for the fervent Prayers of the Righteous avail much. If the Cur&s;es and Complaints of the oppre&s;&s;ed do reach the Ears of God, Jam. 5.4. <HI>Behold the Hire of the Labourers, which have reaped down your Fields, which is of you kept back by Fraud, crieth; and the Cries of them which have reaped, are enter'd into the Ears of the Lord of Sabaoth,</HI> and pull down Vengeance upon Oppre&s;&s;ors: How much more will the Interce&s;&s;ions of the pious Poor, pierce the
<PB N="37" REF="005299_0155_1016F88F14E0F0B0">
Heavens, and bring down Ble&s;&s;ings on the Charitable? But were no &s;uch profitable Fruits following upon the Exerci&s;e of Charity, it's indeed eligible for it's own &s;ake: for it carries a Reward, a Heaven in it's Bo&s;om, even that Calm which in &s;ome Mea&s;ure con&s;titutes the Happine&s;s of the glorified Saints and Angels, and even of God him&s;elf! O then, let us endeavour to obtain and increa&s;e this noble Grace! To this End, let us &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider the Advantages that follow upon it, and the Di&s;advantages which attend the Neglect thereof. Let us therefore ex|erci&s;e Love to God and Chri&s;t, and earne&s;tly beg this Grace of Love to our Brethren, and endeavour after it as far as we can.</P>
<P>But my very dear Brethren! Do not imagine that I have been by this Di&s;cour&s;e, inciting you to an unrea&s;o|nable Charity; i. e. to look upon Per&s;ons to be truly gracious, when they are un&s;ound in the main Principles of Religion; and &s;o to re&s;pect them as &s;uch, becau&s;e of their fair Shew in the Fle&s;h! No! no! This would prove a great Snare to your Souls: For when the Affections are inflamed, the Judgment is apt to be &s;ecretly bya&s;&s;ed in Favour of the Objects of our Love. Tho' Charity hopes all Things, yet it is not &s;tone-blind: We mu&s;t examine well Men's Principles, before we give a loo&s;e to our religious Pa&s;&s;ions towards them. To be &s;u&s;picious when we have Rea&s;on for it, is a godly Jealou&s;y, and very nece&s;&s;ary for our own Se|curity; e&s;pecially in the&s;e perilous Times in which we live. The Charity I have been inciting to, is &s;uch as con|&s;i&s;ts with our Regard to Truth, and to our own Pre&s;erva|tion. It is a common &s;aying, and a very ju&s;t one, That Charity &s;hould begin at Home. Love to our &s;elves is made by our Lord, the Rule of our Love to our Neighbour.</P>
<P>I conclude with the Exhortation of <HI>Paul,</HI> to the <HI>Ephe|&s;ians,</HI> (Eph. 5.1, 2.) <HI>Be ye therefore Followers of God as dear Children, and walk in Love, as Chri&s;t al&s;o hath loved us, and hath given him&s;elf for us, an Offering and a Sacrifice to God, for a &s;weet-&s;melling Savour.</HI></P>

<P>Take us the Foxes, the little Foxes, that &s;poil the Vines, for our Vines have tender Grapes.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_IT is not enough, for one to bring Things into a good State, or Condition at fir&s;t, but we &s;hould al&s;o endeavour afterwards carefully to pre&s;erve them therein: Let a Man in temporal Matters, or civil Affairs, erect ever &s;uch famous Edifices, plant ever &s;uch fine Gardens, and make other Things of curious Workman&s;hip, which with much Art, and great Pains are brought to admirable Perfection, we &s;hall ob&s;erve, that the E&s;teem, that was enter|tained of the Projector's Wi&s;dom and Contrivance, will be much le&s;&s;ened, when the&s;e Things are pre&s;ently neglected, and no more Care or Pains are taken by him to pre&s;erve them, again&s;t tho&s;e Things that might annoy or &s;poil them. How|beit God the all wi&s;e Architect of the Univer&s;e takes no le&s;s Care to maintain, and pre&s;erve the Works of his Hands, than he did in their fir&s;t Formation: of which he gives us daily In&s;tances, by his watchful and providential Care, over the Works of Nature, and in his Church he gives us no le&s;s Proofs of this; if ever he brings his Church into a flouri&s;hing State,
<PB N="2" REF="005299_0158_1016F8937B8657A0">
and makes her appear like a delightful Garden, he takes Care and gives Orders concerning every Thing, that might cau&s;e her Beauty to fade, or rob her of her Ornaments: Which makes the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> to &s;peak of the Church as a Vine|yard on a fruitful Hill, and planted with the choice&s;t Vine. It is very remarkable that the fir&s;t Thing here mentioned of it, is, <HI>And he fenced it,</HI> I&s;ai. 5.1.2. and to what End the &s;ame was thus fenced appears from the 5th Ver&s;e, becau&s;e that Vineyard &s;o beautifully planted might not go to decay, or be trodden under Foot, eaten up or de&s;troy'd by wild Bea&s;ts. Thus God takes Care to turn out of his Church whatever may prove pernicious or hurtful, as well as to cheri&s;h and pre&s;erve whatever may perfect and beautify her Form. This appears very emphatically in the Words of the Text: The Bride|groom was before bu&s;y, in inviting his Bride, as it were into the Country, in order to let her participate of all tho&s;e Plea|&s;ures and Delights, which the Sea&s;on afforded; for it was told her before, that every Thing had a goodly Appearance, and had put on a beautiful Form, and that every Thing now was flouri&s;hing and adorned with all the Beauties, and Per|fections of the Spring-Sea&s;on, &s;hadowing forth the &s;piritual State of the Church, in a high Degree of Perfection; in all Re&s;pects like a beautiful Paradi&s;e of Delight and Happine&s;s. But behold the Lord Je&s;us in the Words of the Text, is bu&s;y and full of Care, that this beautiful Form and Appearance of Things in his Vineyard &s;hould not be marr'd or hurt, but that great Diligence &s;hould be u&s;ed to have them pre&s;erved, and therefore he commands his Servants, to take the&s;e de&s;tructive Foxes, and e&s;pecially the young or little Foxes (which according to the Account that Naturali&s;ts give us of them, are propagated in the Spring, and if not catched, greatly multiply, and prove very pernicious) that they might not hurt, or de&s;troy the Beauties of this Vineyard, as before de&s;cribed; and at the &s;ame Time, that the Bride might not be frightned, and di&s;turbed in her &s;weet Communion and Fellow&s;hip with the Bridegroom, and that what was plea|&s;ant and delightful in this Vineyard, might not be le&s;&s;ened by the &s;poiling of the Vines, and the De&s;truction of the tender Grapes. Thus the Words in more than one Re&s;pect
<PB N="3" REF="005299_0159_1016F8979E21DA18">
have a &s;weet Connection with what went before. <HI>Take us the Foxes, the little Foxes, that &s;poil the Vines, for our Vines have tender Grapes.</HI></P>
<P>The Text then contains a tender Care which the Lord Je&s;us has for his Church, and more e&s;pecially for &s;uch Members of it, as are the weake&s;t, that they may not by wicked and pernicious In&s;truments, lo&s;e their Comeline&s;s, but that they &s;hould be duly watched over, and taken Care of.</P>
<P>Two Heads of Doctrine do naturally flow from the&s;e Words.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> A Command, <HI>Take us the Foxes, the little Foxes, that &s;poil the Vines.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> An Argument, <HI>For our Vines have tender Grapes.</HI></P>
<P>Who it is that &s;peaks here is &s;omewhat ob&s;cure, but as to the Matter &s;poken of, there is but little Difficulty. Some are of Opinion, that the Bride &s;peaks to the Bridegroom, and at the &s;ame time to his Bridemen and Fellows, con&s;i|dered together; or together with the Father and the Holy Gho&s;t; which &s;hould be brought in and included by the Word (<HI>us</HI>&mdash;) But the mo&s;t take them to be the Words of the Bridegroom, and I &s;ee no Rea&s;on to di&s;&s;ent from them. It is not unlikely that what contains a Narrative of her Beloved's An&s;wer as &s;poken by her, ends at the 13th Ver&s;e, and that the Bridegroom begins his Speech to her at the 14th Ver&s;e, and &s;o is continued in this: And if it be taken that the 14th Ver&s;e &s;hould belong to &s;aid Narrative, or Chri&s;t's Call upon his Spou&s;e, as &s;he relates it, yet this 15th Ver&s;e may properly be connected with it; and then it will &s;till appear to be the Words of the Bridegroom, related or &s;poken by the Bride; and tho' &s;he ends her Nar|rative at the 14th Ver&s;e, yet he may very properly be taken and under&s;tood to &s;peak here, for the&s;e following Rea&s;ons. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> To relieve the Bride from new Fears, or Doubts, by giving Command to his Servants, in her Pre|&s;ence, to take the Foxes, which might appear frightful, and offen&s;ive, that &s;o &s;he might without any Scruple, or Doubt, follow him towards the Country. 2dly, Becau&s;e the Matter which is here given in Charge, is peculiar to that tender Care,
<PB N="4" REF="005299_0160_1016F89923D6AAD8">
which the Lord Je&s;us exerci&s;es towards his Church. 3dly, Becau&s;e he has the greate&s;t Prerogative, over tho&s;e to whom this Charge or Command is given. 4thly, As he is the Lord of the Vineyard, he can do it with Autho|rity: and therefore mo&s;t eminently belongs to him. 5ly. This further appears, becau&s;e the Word <HI>(us)</HI> mo&s;t certainly includes him, and it is more fitting, that he &s;hould give Orders, than the Bride.</P>
<P>The Evil which the Bridegroom is here concerned about, he expre&s;&s;es by the Name of <HI>Foxes, little Foxes, that &s;poil the Vines:</HI> The original Word is never otherwi&s;e tran&s;lated by our Interpreters than by the Word <HI>Fox</HI> or <HI>Foxes, Judges</HI> 15.4. <HI>Neh.</HI> 4 3. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 63.11. <HI>Lam.</HI> 5.18. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 13.4. From what this Word hath ari&s;en, is very difficult to know: the learned <HI>Bochart</HI> ob&s;erves, that by the <HI>Chaldeans,</HI> the <HI>Syrians,</HI> and the <HI>Arabians,</HI> a Cough is expre&s;&s;ed by a Word, that agrees with this; and hence he concludes that the Foxes derive their Name, becau&s;e it is peculiar to them to cough; or becau&s;e their Barking re&s;embles a har&s;h or hoar&s;e Cough. He lays the whole &s;tre&s;s of his Opinion, in this Re&s;pect, upon a French Proverb, and on a certain Author, that has made &s;ome Remarks upon it, and ina&s;much as in the &s;ame Remarks, it is &s;aid, that the Foxes are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a great internal Heat of Body (and I add, that they are exceeding Greedy, and of a rapacious Swiftne&s;s) I might with as much Ground of Probability, &s;uppo&s;e, the Word to be derived from an <HI>Arabian</HI> Word, &s;ignifying in that Language (burning) &mdash; However I leave that Matter as it is.</P>
<P>It is a Creature that was known, and very common in the Land of <HI>Canaan;</HI> which &s;eems plain from the Story of <HI>Sam|&s;on,</HI> at lea&s;t they were numerous towards the Borders of the Philli&s;tines Country, <HI>Judges</HI> 13.4. It is a wild Creature, and therefore chiefly re&s;orting in de&s;ert Places, <HI>Lam.</HI> 5.18. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 13.4. and that they are Creatures that feed upon Fle&s;h or Dead Corps is plain from <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 63.10. and <HI>Bochart</HI> ob&s;erves the &s;ame: that they al&s;o fed and prey'd upon Fruits, and de&s;troy'd them, appears plain from the Words of the Text. It is beyond all doubt, that by the Foxes here men|tioned,
<PB N="5" REF="005299_0161_1016F89BF5F18260">
is emblematically &s;ignified, and under&s;tood, a certain Sort of Men. R. <HI>Solomon</HI> a Jew, under&s;tood by the&s;e greater and le&s;&s;er Foxes, the Egyptians, and their Children whom God cau&s;ed to be taken and &s;wallow'd up by the Bil|lows of the <HI>Red Sea:</HI> And hence according to his Notion they have derived their Name; I think but a very &s;lender rea&s;on, <HI>Aben Ezra,</HI> &s;uppo&s;es by them is meant, the wor|&s;hippers of the golden Calf in the Wilderne&s;s, which accor|ding to him, did a great deal of Damage to the young Vineyards of the Children of I&s;rael. The Chaldee Para|phra&s;e makes them, to &s;ignify <HI>Amaleck,</HI> who was contriving to de&s;troy <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in the Wilderne&s;s. Others under&s;tand by the&s;e Foxes, tho&s;e Adver&s;aries of the Jews, who after their Return from the Babylonian Captivity, endeavoured by Force, and all Manner of Artifice, and by their Complaints to the Per&s;ian Monarchs, to hinder and ob&s;truct the rebuil|ding of the Temple, and the re-e&s;tabli&s;hing of the Jewe&s;h State <HI>Ezra</HI> 4. <HI>Neh.</HI> 4.6. Some have under&s;tood them as intending <HI>Herod,</HI> and his Mini&s;try, who de&s;troy'd the innocent Chil|dren in that horrid Murther at Bethlehem: Others again in a larger Sen&s;e, will make them to &s;ignify all Manner of Sin; &s;inful Thoughts, and Affections, which lurk in the hidden Corners, and Rece&s;&s;es of the deceitful Hearts of Men, and which prove very trouble&s;om to the tender Blo&s;&s;oms, and fir&s;t Fruits of Grace in the Children of God; this by Way of Allu&s;ion is &s;omething nearer to the Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>But in Order to an&s;wer the De&s;ign of the Spirit of God, and the u&s;ual Way of explaining &s;uch Kind of Emblems, it will be much better to conceive, and under&s;tand by the Word Foxes, Men who are de&s;tructive In&s;truments of the Church; that prove to be to the Church what Foxes are &s;aid to be to the Vineyards. It is plain, that &s;uch Sort of Men are emblematically repre&s;ented in the Scriptures, and de&s;cribed by different Kinds of wild and brute Bea&s;ts. When by them are &s;ignified &s;uch Men as prove de&s;tructive to the Church, thro' Barbarities and bloody Per&s;cutions, then they are generally called Lyons, Leopards, Bears, and wild Swine, and &s;uch like voracious Animals.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="005299_0162_1016F89ECD50B4E8">Some indeed have al&s;o thought that by Foxes, &s;uch kind of Per&s;ecutors are intended, becau&s;e that Tyrant <HI>Herod,</HI> was by our Lord compared to a Fox, <HI>Luk.</HI> 13.32. But I think it is well ob&s;erved by the famous <HI>Bochart,</HI> that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> did not call him &s;o, &s;o much for his Cruelty as for his Subtilty and Deceitfulne&s;s, of which he had given &s;ome Specimens. I therefore believe with mo&s;t Interpreters, that by Foxes is not &s;o much intended, or to be under&s;tood open and bloody Per&s;ecutors, as more clo&s;e and hidden Injurers of the Church. 1&s;t. Becau&s;e &s;uch mo&s;t frequently appear, in the be&s;t and mo&s;t peaceable State of the Church, as I before hin|ted. 2dly, Becau&s;e &s;uch are not &s;o apt totally to wa&s;te and de&s;troy the Vineyards (which &s;eems more peculiar to Ty|rants, and more voracious Creatures) but only in Part, which is plainly intimated by the&s;e Foxes; who we &s;ee are mo&s;tly bent upon the De&s;truction of the young and tender Grapes, while the Vineyard may &s;till remain. 3dly, Becau&s;e the&s;e are more properly the Subjects, here to be catched and taken, by the Servants and Mini&s;ters of the Bridegroom, and the Bride, which is not &s;o much the Ca&s;e in re&s;pect of cruel and powerful Per&s;ecutors. 4thly, Becau&s;e the par|ticular Denomination of Foxes, in re&s;pect of their Quality, more properly belongs to them. Hence it is that in all Ages, &s;uch Men are more to be found within the Church, who by their Artifice and Craft, have more &s;ecret Ways and Means, to do Injury to Truth and Piety, and have proved dangerous, and hurtful to the Children of God. Such were the fal&s;e Prophets, and deceitful Teachers under the old Te&s;tament Times, who were al&s;o compared to Foxes, Ezek. 13.3, 4. <HI>Thus &s;aith the Lord God, Wo unto the fooli&s;h Prophets, that follow their own Spirit, and have &s;een nothing.

and fal&s;e Brethren of the Jews, tho&s;e vain and mi&s;taken Phi|lo&s;ophers of the Heathens, who either by their Jewi&s;h, or heatheni&s;h Principles and Doctrines, had perverted the Doc|trines of Chri&s;tian Liberty, and the Simplicity of the Go&s;pel, and all that Train of Hereticks, Seducers, and Schi&s;maticks, who from Time to Time have appeared in the Go&s;pel Church; a Catalogue of which in every Age we have recorded by the learned <HI>Spanheim</HI> in his Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory. Certain it is that all &s;uch Kind of noxious, and de&s;tructive In&s;tru|ments in the Church, may very emphatically be compared to Foxes.</P>
<P>If any &s;hould be &s;o inqui&s;itive, as to de&s;ire a more or le&s;s certain De&s;cription, of the Nature and Quality of Foxes, they may &s;ee what Naturali&s;ts have &s;aid concerning them, as &s;et forth at large by <HI>Ge&s;nerus, Bochart,</HI> and others. I &s;hall but briefly mention a few of them.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Foxes are famous among the Herds of Animals for their great Cunning, and Craft: for which Rea&s;on we before ob&s;erved, the Lord Je&s;us called <HI>Herod</HI> a Fox&punc; Many Proverbs are taken and borrowed by the Antients, from their Subtilty. Many In&s;tances of their Craft, and the common Compari&s;on of crafty Men to Foxes, are mentioned and recorded by the &s;aid Hi&s;torians. It is al&s;o noted by them that the Names of Foxes, are taken from their &s;ubtilne&s;s, e&s;pecially among the Grecians. Hereticks, and &s;uch like Di&s;turbers of the Church, are generally Men of Wit and Ingenuity. It's true, there have been &s;ome among them, Men of weak Minds, and little Parts, and have been Broachers of very blunt Errors; but then &s;uch have had but little Influence; but others were keen and cunning Wits, ingenious Philo&s;ophers, who did oppo&s;e them&s;elves to the my&s;terious and &s;imple Doctrines of the Go&s;pel, with all the Force of Wit, and Eloquence which they were Ma&s;ters of; upon which account <HI>Tertullian</HI> often &s;aith <HI>De ingenio profe&s;&s;orum Sapientiae omnem haere&s;in anamari: Haere&s;is Philo&s;ophos et Haereticorum Patriarchas e&s;&s;e:</HI> that all Here&s;ie was animated by the Wit of the Profe&s;&s;ors of Philo&s;ophy, that through an eager De&s;ire after Wi&s;dom Here|&s;ies
<PB N="8" REF="005299_0164_1016F8A479E73248">
were broached, that Philo&s;ophers were the Patriarchs of all Hereticks.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, Foxes becau&s;e of their Cunning and Sagacity, are of a treacherous, and deceitful Practice, full of Devices, and of a &s;educing Behaviour. Now not a more natural, or proper Character, can be given of Hereticks and fal&s;e Teachers; they are generally well furni&s;hed with cunning, eva&s;ive, and di&s;&s;imulating Tricks: St. <HI>Paul</HI> therefore calls them vain Talkers, and Deceivers, <HI>Titus</HI> 1.10. who as it were juggle and bewitch the People, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.1. who <HI>&s;ub|vert whole Families Tit,</HI> 1.11. <HI>&s;educing Spirits,</HI> 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.1. <HI>deceitful Workers,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.13. who by their <HI>&s;leight and cunning Craftine&s;s ea&s;ily deceive,</HI> Eph. 4.14. And if it plea&s;e you I &s;hall de&s;cend into further Particulars, to &s;hew you the Analogy between the Foxes, and Seducers and fal&s;e Teachers.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Foxes, that they may the better conceal them|&s;elves, &s;ub&s;i&s;t not &s;o much above Ground, as in Holes and Caverns, under the Earth, and often the&s;e are very deep. Luk. 9.58. <HI>The Foxes have Holes</HI> &amp;c. Hereticks, and Sedu|cers, always endeavour to hide their Doctrines and Opini|ons, and keep them as &s;ecret as they can. Certain it is, that they do not pre&s;ently, and openly appear to the World, but know how to hide them&s;elves, under &s;ly Shifts, and cunning Eva&s;ions. We find therefore the Lord Je&s;us u&s;ed it as an Argument, that no One might &s;u&s;pect his Doctrine, John 18.20. <HI>I &s;pake openly to the World, I ever taught in the Synagogues, and in the Temple whither the Jews always re&s;ort, and in &s;ecret have I &s;aid nothing.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2dly, Their Holes have but a very &s;traight and narrow Entrance; and it is &s;urprizing how they can &s;que&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and &s;tretch them&s;elves out, to get into tho&s;e narrow Pa&s;&s;ages. <HI>Horace</HI> therefore makes mention of a certain Fox, that crept through an exceeding narrow Crack; <HI>Forte per angu&s;|tam tenuis Vulpecula rimam &amp;c.</HI> It is al&s;o peculiar to Here|ticks, and fal&s;e Teachers, not to &s;uffer their &s;ecret Wiles to be &s;earched into and di&s;covered; they hide and be&s;et them&s;elves and their Opinions, as artfully as they can; they &s;peak of them, in &s;uch equivocating and doubtful
<PB N="9" REF="005299_0165_1016F8A7AB48B428">
Terms, that one mu&s;t &s;earch well, and make a very nar|row In&s;pection, if he &s;hall di&s;cover their Fox-Holes; and little would he think (if he penetrates &s;o far) to find &s;o much Deceit lurking behind the Scene. St. <HI>Peter</HI> therefore &s;peaks of them, as fal&s;e Teachers, who &s;hall privily bring in damnable Here&s;ies, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.1.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, Foxes, at Places where they chiefly re&s;ort, have mo&s;t commonly, many Ways, and Pa&s;&s;ages, to come out at; becau&s;e if one &s;hould be &s;topped or clo&s;ed up they may have another to creep out at. Hereticks, and fal&s;e Teachers, al&s;o have their Trenches, and here and there a back Door, that when they come to be &s;o clo&s;e &s;et, and have as it were their Mouths &s;topped, they may have &s;ome mean Shift or Equivocation to help them&s;elves withal.</P>
<P N="4">4thly, It will appear from what has been already &s;aid, that Foxes are very hard to be catched. Fal&s;e Teachers, tho&s;e of them that are any thing crafty, are hard to be di&s;co|vered, and yet more difficult to be convinced.</P>
<P N="5">5thly, Foxes that they may not be &s;o ea&s;ily en&s;nared &s;eldom run right forward, but run to one Side, and to the other Side, and cro&s;s Ways; from which &s;ome of the Latins have derived the Name, <HI>Vulpes qua&s;i Volipes.</HI> Hereticks and Seducers in like Manner, have for&s;aken the right Ways, and run into perver&s;e and crooked By-Roads; and thus the further they go on, the further they go a &s;tray from the right Ways of Truth.</P>
<P N="6">6thly They have a &s;ly Way of creeping into other Holes, and of turning other Animals (it may be &s;aid) out of their rightful Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. So it is with re&s;pect to fal&s;e Teachers and Seducers, of whom St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;peaks: <HI>For of this Sort are tho&s;e which creep into Hou&s;es,</HI> 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.6. And it may be generally &s;aid of them, that they creep into &s;ettled Mini&s;tries and Congregations, and turn out tho&s;e that are orthodox among&s;t them, by their poi&s;onous and infectious Errors, and &s;ome Times (if &s;uch Means will not do, when they get the upper Hand) by u&s;ing Force and Violence.</P>
<P N="7">7thly, Foxes know how to di&s;&s;emble, and often &s;how what they are not, in order to cheat and decoy le&s;s harmle&s;s Creatures, and to make a Prey of them. If we may give
<PB N="10" REF="005299_0166_1016F8ABC5FBDC40">
Credit to what <HI>Epiphanius</HI> &s;ayeth, they are wont to &s;tretch them&s;elves out on the Earth, and lay as if they had no Life in them, that when the Fowls of the Air perceiving them, may by lighting upon them, become their Prey; and al&s;o as they in outward Appearance are not much unlike Dogs; &s;ome times they venture to mingle them&s;elves with tho&s;e Dogs that are &s;et to watch the Flock, <HI>Job.</HI> 30.1. And that they know how to imitate the Barkings of tho&s;e Watch-Dogs; and by that Means decoy and en&s;nare the innocent Flock, which tho&s;e Dogs are &s;et over. Fal&s;e Teachers and Sedu|cers are wonderfully &s;killed in &s;uch Kind of Tricks; they know how to appear outwardly very kind, friendly, and courteous, as if they meant or intended no Harm; they appear to be very tender, candid, and patient, full of Meek|ne&s;s and Love; and are mightely for Chri&s;tian Liberty; and by this Means intice the Simple, and &s;teal into their Hearts and Affections; and al&s;o they know how to imitate the good Watch-Dogs; to which faithful Pa&s;tors may be com|pared in Contradi&s;tinction of what we read, <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> 56.10, 11. and <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.2. St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays of the fal&s;e Apo&s;tles and deceitful Workers, that they are <HI>even as Satan transforming them&s;elves into Angels of Light.</HI></P>
<P>Sometimes in the Church they bear the &s;ame Offices with the Faithful, and are outwardly join'd with them, and are very &s;trict in all their Behaviour; they make a &s;pecious Shew in the Performance of all the Duties of Morality and Piety, equal to, and often beyond any others: As we may &s;ee in the Phari&s;ees of old, and more lately in the <HI>Novatians, Donati&s;ts, Pelageans, Je&s;uits, Socinians, Quakers;</HI> and many others. The&s;e are the <HI>fal&s;e Prophets in Sheeps Clothing, but within are ravening Wolves,</HI> Mat. 7.15. They are very artful in putting a fine Glo&s;s upon their erronious Principles and Doctrines, to make them agreable to natural Rea&s;on, and know how to cook and dre&s;s them up to the particular Ta&s;tes of Men; They can not only varni&s;h them with a Shew of great Wi&s;dom, but al&s;o (as if they were &s;ound) cloke them with holy Scripture, and under the Umbrage of &s;ome Truths, which they &s;till retain, mix and mingle their perni|cious Errors: They al&s;o &s;peak like the true Watchmen,
<PB N="11" REF="005299_0167_1016F8AD4B6C8B98">
often not only with much Eloquence, but under a Pretence of extraordinary Revelations; yea they can &s;peak the Lan|guage of true Divines. You &s;hall hardly meet with a Heretick without a good Stock of Literature, by Means whereof under ambiguous Expre&s;&s;ions, and mental Eva&s;ions, they hide them|&s;elves, even as <HI>Ireneus</HI> &s;peaks of them; "They (&s;ays he) &s;peak the &s;ame Things, but believe otherways". Such were the Subtilties of the <HI>Arians,</HI> which they &s;hewed after their Errors were detected, and condemned at <HI>Bithany,</HI> when in a City in <HI>Thrace,</HI> of the &s;ame Name, they drew up a fal&s;e Creed, and put it into the Hands of the &s;impler Sort, under the Name of the <HI>Nicene.</HI> Church Hi&s;tory informs us, that it was com|mon for that Arch-Heretick <HI>Arius,</HI> to &s;peak in the &s;ame Strain, and with the &s;ame Language of the Faithful, but al|ways had &s;ome mental Re&s;erve, and couched under a quite different Meaning. And at la&s;t, when by the In&s;tigation of the Emperor he was pre&s;&s;ed upon to &s;ub&s;cribe to the true <HI>Nicene</HI> Creed, it's ob&s;erved that he underwrote thus, <HI>As I have underwritten, &s;o I do believe:</HI> Meaning at the &s;ame time a certain Writing, which he then had under his Arm, and had prepared before Hand and &s;ub&s;cribed unto. Such are truly tho&s;e <HI>Lyars</HI> who by their Hypocri&s;y do &s;educe, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.2. Who <HI>cau&s;e Divi&s;ions and Offences, contrary to &s;ound Doctrine; and by good Words and fair Speeches, de|ceive the Hearts of the Simple,</HI> Rom. 16.17, 18. Who give them&s;elves out for <HI>Apo&s;tles and are not, but are found Liars,</HI> Rev. 2.2. All the afore&s;aid Particulars, may be brought to prove the cunning of Foxes, and their Analogy with &s;uch Hereticks and Seducers, and are the chief Things aim'd at, in the&s;e emblematical Characters contain'd in the Text: However we may add this further, that Foxes as they are wild Creatures, have an inherent Savagene&s;s and Cruelty joined with their Cunning, which appears plain from <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 63.10. Hereticks and Seducers if they can't make their Delu&s;ions take as they like, and they get the upper Hand, by getting the Authority on their Side, they generally become cruel; then they cannot bear tho&s;e that are faithful; then they will fall upon them with all Kinds of A&s;per&s;ions, and fal&s;e Accu&s;ations, and become their cruel
<PB N="12" REF="005299_0168_1016F8AED2F2D098">
Per&s;ecutors; then they change their Shape, and become ravening Wolves, to whom in this Re&s;pect they are com|pared, <HI>Matth.</HI> 7.15. <HI>Grievous Wolves,</HI> Matth. 20.29. <HI>Evil Bea&s;ts,</HI> Tit. 1.12. What Mi&s;chiefs did not the fal&s;e Prophets hatch again&s;t the true Prophets, and tho&s;e that held with them, under the Reigns of the Kings of Judah? What Babarities &amp; Cruelties were exerci&s;ed again&s;t the Faithful, by tho&s;e Apo&s;tates among the <HI>Maccabees</HI> after their Return out of Captivity? How bloody was the Rage of the Scribes, and Heads of the Jewi&s;h Church again&s;t the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, again&s;t his Apo&s;tles, and the whole Body of the primitive Chri&s;tians? How many bitter Trials and Sufferings have the faithful Chri&s;tians undergone by Rea&s;on of the &s;uperiour Strength of Hereticks and Seducers, and the Influence they have had with tho&s;e in civil or regal Authority? All which abundantly appears from the Te&s;timonies of Scripture, both of the old and new Te&s;tament, from the Books of the <HI>Maccabees,</HI> and Church Chronicles; and above all, from the mo&s;t terrible &amp; barbarous Cruelties committed by the <HI>Arians</HI> in divers Per&s;ecutions under the Favour and Pro|tection of the Emperors and Empre&s;&s;es of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>The Text further &s;peaks of <HI>little Foxes:</HI> The&s;e &s;eem to be more particularly mentioned, not &s;o much becau&s;e ea&s;ier catched than the older and more cunning, as &s;ome have ob&s;erved; neither becau&s;e they are more &s;wift and greedy, and con&s;equently more mi&s;chievous than the old, as others would have it, (of both which I much doubt) but chiefly ina&s;much as they are &s;maller, are not &s;o ea&s;ily &s;een and di&s;covered, and have every where an ea&s;ier Acce&s;s, and for that Rea&s;on are more dangerous in doing Mi&s;chief, and therefore not to be neglected or thought too little of: And more particularly it &s;erves to in&s;truct us, to be watch|ful again&s;t all Manner of Evil in it's &s;malle&s;t Beginnings. Should we pa&s;s by the little Foxes, they will become big ones in a little Time, and by their Growth and Increa&s;e, will be able &s;oon to over-run every Thing.</P>
<P>Now to an&s;wer the De&s;ign of the Text, when the Lord Je&s;us commands his Servants to watch again&s;t the evil Workers and Corrupters of his Church, under the
<PB N="13" REF="005299_0169_1016F8B29BE6F1C0">
Characters of <HI>little Foxes;</HI> it is not intended or &s;poken &s;o much by Way of Diminution, nor becau&s;e by an affected Humility, they appear &s;mall (as &s;ome do take it) but the Lord intends by it a &s;econd Sort of Injurers of his Church, &s;uch who&s;e Errors comparatively are not &s;o great, and al&s;o &s;uch perhaps who have not the greate&s;t Party, and are not in mo&s;t E&s;teem, or &s;uch who are yet as it were hidden; and in this Re&s;pect much re&s;emble little Foxes, who are low and &s;quat, and apt to &s;neak away; and are thus more apt to pa&s;s unob&s;erved: Such there have been in the primitive Churches, be&s;ides tho&s;e Arch-Hereticks, and &s;uch there have been in after Ages, even until now. The&s;e do not altogether &s;ubvert the Exi&s;tence of the Church, or per|vert her in all the Fundamentals of the Chri&s;tian Faith, but neverthele&s;s, can do a great deal of Mi&s;chief, both as to the Truths and the Peace of the Church, and frequently prove Forerunners of larger Foxes, which in Time wax &s;trong; and therefore the Lord Je&s;us will not have them excu&s;ed, and by Con&s;equence is not at all for Toleration in this Point. He intends by it all Injurers of the Church in their fir&s;t Appearance, while they are yet young and &s;mall, for then they are not &s;o cunning, and altogether &s;o mi&s;|chievous, as they may be in proce&s;s of Time; neither are their Errors &s;o gro&s;s, which generally in Time do increa&s;e, their Party not &s;o &s;trong, and their Credit and Re&s;pect is le&s;s, and therefore never ea&s;ier &s;topped than while they are &s;mall.</P>
<P>Now the Lord here &s;uppo&s;es (and it is al&s;o evident from all Experience) that &s;uch Foxes both great and &s;mall have been, and will be in all Ages of the Church. And with re&s;pect to their Mi&s;cheivou&s;ne&s;s he further adds, <HI>which</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>&s;poil the Vines.</HI> It is natural and peculiar to Foxes, to &s;poil the Vines (whether we con&s;ider them as re&s;pecting whole Vineyards, or particular Vines, is little to the Pur|po&s;e; for the one includes the other, and it is true in both Re&s;pects) by rooting at the Roots, taring down the Leaves, the Branches; and particularly by de&s;troying the Fruits. Hence perhaps it was that <HI>Sam&s;on</HI>'s Foxes, among other Things, fell foul of the Phili&s;tines Vineyards, <HI>Judg.</HI> 15.5.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="005299_0170_1016F8B6C7985218">Thus we have &s;een that Foxes, as before de&s;cribed, are naturally bent upon, and actually do de&s;troy the <HI>Vineyards,</HI> and <HI>&s;poil the Vines.</HI> The Church and the People of God in Scripture are frequently compared to a <HI>Vineyard, Cant.</HI> 8.11, 12. <HI>I&s;ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> 3.4. <HI>Chap.</HI> 1.7. <HI>&amp;</HI> 25.11.2. and in many other Places. When the Lord Je&s;us here makes mention of Vines in the plural Number, particular Churches &s;eem plainly to be intimated, or Congregations which are as &s;o many <HI>Vineyards,</HI> and Believers as &s;o many <HI>Vines</HI> &s;cattered up and down within the Compa&s;s of certain Cities or Countries, which are planted, and grow up together, bear|ing Fruit under the &s;pecial and peculiar Care of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, fenced about by his Power, &s;hone upon by the bright Beams of his Countenance, watered by his Word and Spirit, and made fruitful by his peculiar Benediction. But the&s;e are Things not at pre&s;ent to be inlarged upon.</P>
<P>But here take Notice, that Foxes both great and &s;mall are &s;aid to &s;poil the Vines, which in the Original &s;ignifies as much as all Manner of Injury more or le&s;s, or even to the utter De&s;truction of any Thing. See <HI>Ezra</HI> 6.12. <HI>Dan.</HI> 4.23. <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 13.5. And here we may take it in its full Latitude for all <HI>fal&s;e Teachers,</HI> and Seducers, Hereticks, and Schi&s;maticks &amp;c. who &s;poil the&s;e &s;piritual Vineyards in all the following Particulars.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t in the Truth: By the &s;preading of Lyes, and propagated of fal&s;e Doctrines, which cannot be &s;upported by the Word of God, whatever &s;pecious Pretences they may have notwith&s;tanding; who turn People about by the Wind of their Doctrine, and by their Cunning ea&s;ily &s;educe, <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.14. St. <HI>Paul</HI> in this Re&s;pect compares their Doctrine to a mortal Di&s;ea&s;e, which, &s;ays he, <HI>will eat a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th a Canker,</HI> 2 Tim. 2.17.

<P>Secondly, in Piety: When the Truths which are from God, and which are our Directory and true Guide, be taken away, it will follow that Godline&s;s and true Piety mu&s;t totally decay; by Contentions and Divi&s;ions, they may be led to Di&s;regard inward Frames and Experiences,
<PB N="15" REF="005299_0171_1016F8BAE60EE3B0">
and carried away from the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential and practical Things in the Chri&s;tian Religion, and in&s;tead of getting their Hearts &s;trengthned by Grace, they will be carried about with diver&s;e and &s;trange Doctrines, and take up with &s;uch Things which have not profited them that have been occupied therein, <HI>Heb.</HI> 13.9. We &s;ee that <HI>Paul</HI> con&s;i|ders the&s;e Things as Oppo&s;ites that cannot be join'd toge|ther: <HI>Refu&s;e profane and old Wives Fables, and exerci&s;e thy &s;elf rather unto Godline&s;s,</HI> 1 Tim. 4.7. This will yet further appear, when &s;uch Seducers lay &s;uch a Foundation which has a natural Tendency to Sin, and opens a Door for carnal Security, and Self-deceiving, or when they by their Lives and Examples &s;educe into Sin. This St. <HI>Peter</HI> makes mention of, 2 Pet. 2.18, 19. <HI>For when they &s;peak great &s;welling Words of Vanity, they allure through the Lu&s;ts of the Fle&s;h, through much Wantonne&s;s, tho&s;e that were clean e&s;caped from them who live in Error; while they promi&s;e them Liberty, they them&s;elves are the Servants of Corruption.</HI> Of the&s;e Sort were all tho&s;e which in the primitive Chur|ches were reckoned among the impure Gno&s;ticks, the Followers of <HI>Simon, Meander, Saturni&aacute;s, Ba&s;ilides, Carpo|crates, Valentius,</HI> and many others; every one of which opened a Door to all Manner of Ungodline&s;s. Thus God &s;aid of the hypocritical Prophets in <HI>Judah,</HI> Jer. 23.14. <HI>I have &s;een al&s;o in the Prophets of Jeru&s;alem an horrible Thing, they commit Adultery and walk in Lies, they &s;trengthen al&s;o the Hands of the evil Doers, that none doth return from his Wickedne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, in the Wor&s;hip of God: For when Truth and Piety decay, it generally follows that the very E&s;&s;ence of Wor&s;hip will be corrupted, the Spirit and Purity of it will fail, Super&s;tition and Will-Wor&s;hip will prevail: This may be &s;een of the fal&s;e Prophets of I&s;rael, who &s;educed the People into Idolatry. And in tho&s;e Apo&s;tates among the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">accabees,</HI> who brought the Grecian <HI>Ethicks</HI> into God's Wor&s;hip, and in the Sects of the Samaritans, Herodians, Phari&s;ees, Sadducees, and E&s;&s;eens, who took the very <HI>Soul</HI> out of the in&s;tituted Wor&s;hip of God, which made it ap|pear in every Re&s;pect like a meer Image without Life a

Web interwoven with Hypocri&s;y and human Inventions. This we have al&s;o &s;een in Antichri&s;t, who changed the whole Wor&s;hip of God into Super&s;tition, Will-Wor&s;hip and Idolatry.</P>
<P>Fourthly, in Order, Unity, and Peace. We &s;hall &s;ee that, that &s;weet Comeline&s;s and Beauty, will pre&s;ently depart from the Lord's Vineyard: Even as Foxes do turn every Thing up&s;ide down, mar and &s;poil the Order and Beauty of Vineyards; &s;o every Thing in the Church will be turned up&s;ide down, and brought into a &s;trange Con|fu&s;ion. Whenever the&s;e <HI>Church Foxes</HI> make their Appea|rance, all Manner of Contentions, Di&s;quietudes, and Di|vi&s;ions, Quarrels and Schi&s;ms, break out; that mutual Love that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted before, is turned into Hatred. St. <HI>Paul</HI> therefore de&s;cribes them as &s;uch, which <HI>cau&s;e Divi&s;ions and Offences contrary to the Doctrine which they have learned,</HI> Rom. 16.17. St. <HI>James</HI> ob&s;erves it as a Con&s;equence of &s;uch a Wi&s;dom which is not from above, but is (&s;aith he) <HI>earthly, &s;en&s;ual, and devili&s;h: for where Envying and Strife is, there is Confu&s;ion, and every evil Work,</HI> Jam. 3.15, 16.</P>
<P>Fifthly, in Growth: For as Foxes by rooting up and taring off the Buds and Branches of Vineyards, do va&s;tly ob&s;truct and hinder their Growth; &s;o we may ob&s;erve, that as &s;oon as ever fal&s;e Doctrine and Here&s;y appear, the Growth and Progre&s;s of the Church will &s;oon meet with an uncommon Shock; the Growth of young Converts will be exceedingly check'd: The&s;e do not know by Rea&s;on of the&s;e Contentions and Divi&s;ions that happen, what Cour&s;e either to &s;teer, or on which Side to turn them&s;elves; and on the other Hand many Branches that did belong to her, will be quite torn off.</P>
<P>Sixthly, in her Fruit bearing. Whereas Foxes in Vine|yards do Injury to the Fruits in more than one Re&s;pect, they mar them in the Bud, as well as de&s;troy them when come to Maturity; even &s;o by the&s;e Means in the Church, &s;piritual Fruitfulne&s;s pre&s;ently decays and withers away in &s;uch Congregations; the goodly Fruits of Faith, Love, and Holine&s;s, drop off, and they are &s;wallowed up with Uncha|ritablene&s;s and Di&s;quietudes.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="005299_0173_1016F8BE41DECA50">Seventhly, in her Bloom and Ornaments: For as Foxes in Vineyards do de&s;troy every Thing that is ornamental, by tearing down the Branches, Leaves, and Fruits; even &s;o it is with the mo&s;t blooming and flouri&s;hing Church, when the&s;e &s;piritual <HI>Foxes</HI> come into it; her Appearance and A&s;pect is often times &s;o much changed from what it was, that &s;he hardly in any Re&s;pect looks like the &s;ame; all her Splendor is departed, her Bloom and Beauty decay'd, and all her Robes are &s;o rent and torn, that every Thing hangs as it were in Rags about her. Do we not even behold this in the Times pa&s;t, in &s;o many beautiful Congrega|tions in the ea&s;tern Churches; which by Rea&s;on of Here&s;ies among them, had almo&s;t lo&s;t the very E&s;&s;ence and &s;malle&s;t Remains of true Chri&s;tianity? And what became of the Church when Antichri&s;t over&s;pread the &s;ame, is too well known to need a Recital.</P>
<P>Eighthly, in her Strength and Security: Even as Foxes are wont to root at the Roots of Vineyards, and cau&s;e them to totter and &s;hake, &s;o do the&s;e Here&s;ies cau&s;e every Thing to &s;hake, by rooting up the Foundations upon which this &s;piritual Vineyard is built, the Plants thereof are made loo&s;e, and begin to &s;hake; they begin to lean and incline to Lies; and &s;ome do totally fall down. Thus St. <HI>Paul</HI> warns us again&s;t Men that &s;hould ari&s;e; as he &s;ays Act. 20.30. <HI>Al&s;o of your own &s;elves &s;hall Men ari&s;e, &s;peaking per|ver&s;e Things, to draw away Di&s;ciples after them:</HI> And as &s;uch that &s;hould be the Cau&s;e of <HI>&s;ome to depart from the Faith,</HI> 1 Tim. 4.5. Some that &s;hould <HI>depart from the Faith, giving Heed to &s;educing Spirits.</HI> Yea, they will even tear up the Inclo&s;ure of the Lord's Vineyard, and leave it de&s;titute of all Security and Defence, by breaking through all Church-Di&s;cipline, or by getting in Favour with the &s;ecular Powers, and drawing them over to their Party; which otherwi&s;e are a Defence and Security to the Church. This has been &s;een in the fal&s;e Prophets of old, in the apo&s;tate Jews among the <HI>Maccabees,</HI> who were in Collu&s;ion with the Syrian Monarchs; and in &s;everal other Hereticks in the primitive Churches; and more lately in the Bi&s;hops of <HI>Rome,</HI> the <HI>Remon&s;trants,</HI> and many others.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="005299_0174_1016F8C074B37098">Ninthly and la&s;tly. As a Con&s;equence of what has been &s;aid, it brings endle&s;s Ruin upon the <HI>Souls</HI> of Men that are &s;educed by them; no le&s;s than the Lo&s;s of their eter|nal Salvation. This is certainly al&s;o an Evil or Mi&s;|chief that they bring upon the Lord's Vineyard. It's not only a Here&s;y in Morals, but a Here&s;y in Doctrines, which ruins the Souls of Men, and &s;inks them into eternal Per|dition: Even as St. <HI>Peter</HI> tells us of an eternal De&s;truction, that follows and flows from Here&s;ies, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. throughout that whole Chapter. Well may the Lord therefore call them, <HI>Pa&s;tors that de&s;troy and &s;catter the Sheep of his Pa&s;ture,</HI> Jer. 23.1.</P>
<P>We &s;ee from what has been &s;aid, in how many In&s;tan|ces, and in Truth, that &s;uch Foxes do <HI>&s;poil the Vines.</HI> And if we &s;hould let them go on in their Way without controul, we &s;hould quickly find the Truth of what was &s;aid of other Pa&s;tors, Jer. 12.10. <HI>Many Pa&s;tors have de&s;troy'd my Vineyard, they have trodden my Portion under Foot; they have made my plea&s;ant Portion a de&s;olate Wilderne&s;s.</HI> Yea, we &s;hould quickly &s;ee that neither Vineyard nor Branch would be found. This is therefore the Rea&s;on why the Lord Je&s;us will have his Vineyard carefully watched over, and is the Rea&s;on why he commands his Servants, as in the Words of the Text, <HI>Take us the Foxes, the little Foxes that &s;poil the Vines, for our Vines have tender Grapes.</HI></P>
<P>There is a Diver&s;ity of Opinions, concerning the Per|&s;ons to whom this Command &s;hould be given: Some un|der&s;tand it to be the Angels; others, the civil Powers; but the mo&s;t, Pa&s;tors and Teachers: I incline rather to take the Command in a larger Sen&s;e; <HI>i. e.</HI> to concern all tho&s;e why &s;tand in any near Relation to the Bridegroom, over whom he exerci&s;es his peculiar Authority, and who are in any Re&s;pect capable or qualified to take the&s;e Foxes.</P>
<P>As fir&s;t, All <HI>Over&s;eers</HI> of the Church in all Ages, and of all Stations and Degrees; <HI>i. e.</HI> Prophets, Prie&s;ts, Apo&s;tles, Evangeli&s;ts, Pa&s;tors, and Teachers; to whom in Re&s;pect of their Offices, this Duty of taking the Foxes, mo&s;t eminently and peculiarly belongs.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="19" REF="005299_0175_1016F8C755A7F5E8">2. This Duty includes and enjoins all particular Be|lievers, when a fit Opportunity pre&s;ents, &s;o far as they have Talents and Capacities to detect tho&s;e that are in Error, to oppo&s;e and endeavour to convince them: <HI>Looking diligently, le&s;t any Man fail of the Grace of God; le&s;t any Root of Bitterne&s;s &s;pringing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled,</HI> Heb. 12.15.</P>
<P>Now of all the&s;e it is required to <HI>take</HI> the&s;e <HI>Foxes,</HI> the&s;e <HI>young Foxes:</HI> It might as well be tran&s;lated, to apprehend, to hold. Naturali&s;ts do ob&s;erve, that tho' Foxes can be taken, yet it is very difficult. Here in a &s;piritual Sen&s;e, it al&s;o requires great Pains and Indu&s;try to take the&s;e Foxes. Je&s;us Chri&s;t here gives Power and Command to do it; <HI>Take us the Foxes.</HI></P>
<P>Now wherein the Matter of this Duty con&s;i&s;ts, is not very difficult to conceive; generally, it con&s;i&s;ts in u&s;ing all po&s;&s;ible and nece&s;&s;ary Means, to prevent the&s;e Foxes from doing any Kind of Mi&s;chief to the Lord's Vineyard.</P>

return from the Paths of Delu&s;ion, into the Bo&s;om of the Church Such was the happy taking of a cunning Fox, a very learned Philo&s;opher (according to what <HI>Sozomen</HI> tells of him) who in the Council of <HI>Nice,</HI> did vehemently and impudently oppo&s;e the Doctrines of Faith; but the &s;ame was by a Member of that Council (tho' otherwi&s;e not the mo&s;t ingenious, yet honourable for his Age) convinced, and immediately taken in the Net of the Go&s;pel, and drawn by the Cords of irre&s;i&s;table Grace into an effectual and &s;incere Repentance. Not much unlike unto this, was what the &s;ame Author relates of another Philo&s;opher, who was cho&s;en out of many others, as the able&s;t to enter into a Debate with <HI>Alexander,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> that he was &s;o &s;truck with the fir&s;t Word &s;poken by the Bi&s;hop, that he could not utter one Word.</P>
<P N="5">5. We &s;hould, when all other Means fail, by eccle&s;i|a&s;tical Methods (without any Force or Re&s;traint upon the Con&s;cience, or Per&s;ecution) &s;et Bounds to, and hinder them from propagating their pernicious and de&s;tructive Errors.</P>
<P N="6">6 and la&s;tly, To ca&s;t them out of the Lord's Vineyard; namely, by Excommunication. By this we declare them to be no more Brothers; and by it they are cut off from Communion with the People of God.

<P N="1">1. That there is a mutual <HI>Fellow&s;hip</HI> &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his Church; that their Intere&s;t is in com|mon, as betwixt Husband and Wife, Bridegroom and Bride.</P>
<P N="2">2. That what Service is done for the one, is al&s;o done for the other. Whoever &s;erves Je&s;us Chri&s;t, does at the &s;ame Time &s;erve his Church and People.</P>
<P N="3">3. That an Injury done to the one, is an Injury done to the other; and that the&s;e Foxes are in both their Way, and therefore &s;hould be taken for the one as well as for the other.</P>
<P N="4">4. That Je&s;us Chri&s;t makes the Intere&s;t and Concern of the Church his own, and reckons whatever is done to her, as if the &s;ame was done to him&s;elf. Matth. 10.40. <HI>Whoever receiveth you, receiveth me.</HI> Zech. 2.8. <HI>For he that toucheth you, toucheth the Apple of his Eye.</HI> Act. 9.4. <HI>Saul, Saul, why per&s;ecute&s;t thou me?</HI> And &s;ee <HI>Mar.</HI> 9.41. <HI>Matth.</HI> 25.35, 45.</P>
<P N="5">5. That Chri&s;t and the Spou&s;e mutually take Delight and have a Complacency in this; and &s;o the Words, <HI>Take us the Foxes,</HI> will &s;ignify as much as take them for Our Plea&s;ure and Delight; even as great Per&s;onages &s;ometimes make cha&s;ing or hunting Matches for their Diver&s;ion.</P>
<P N="6">6. This would be of great Service, and in a particular Manner conduce to promote the Ea&s;e of the Bridegroom and of the Bride, that in as much as &s;he was to accompany him towards the Country, it would be nece&s;&s;ary that the&s;e Foxes &s;hould be fir&s;t taken, and removed out of the Way. Now who would refu&s;e to promote the great In|tere&s;t of this honourable Couple, by preventing the Mi&s;|chief that would accrue to their Vineyard?

that &s;hould not be enough, the Lord Je&s;us urges this further, and &s;aith (which often in the Hebrew is giving a Rea&s;on, and is therefore with us well tran&s;lated by the Word <HI>For) For our Vines,</HI> (by which he al&s;o further &s;hews and a&s;certains the mutual Property they had in this Vine|yard) <HI>have tender Grapes.</HI> The &s;ame original Words we find in the 13th Ver&s;e of this Chapter: We may under|&s;tand by it weak or tender Chri&s;tians, &s;uch either be|cau&s;e they have not been long on the Way, or being but &s;mall in Knowledge, weak in Faith, and other Chri&s;tian Graces, like young Children, (1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.1, 2. <HI>Heb.</HI> 5.12. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.2. 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 2.12.) or rather becau&s;e of the Weakne&s;s or Tenderne&s;s of the Habit of Grace in the Converted, which may be taken for the Vines. Only here take Notice, that the Lord Je&s;us u&s;es this as an Excitement to take the Foxes.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, We may take it generally, as if he &s;hould &s;ay; Our Vines are as tender as temporal Vineyard, having tender Grapes; and then we might take it as if the Tran&s;lation run thus, <HI>For our Vines are as Vineyards hav|ing tender Grapes:</HI> That is to &s;ay, the Fruits and Work of Grace in Believers, are as tender, can bear as little, and are as ea&s;ily marr'd, as the tender Grapes are in the Vineyards; for which Rea&s;on it is the more nece&s;&s;ary to take the&s;e Foxes, here repre&s;ented to be in the&s;e &s;piritual Vineyards; becau&s;e they are always as noxious and dan|gerous in the Church, as Foxes are in the temporal Vine|yards having young and tender Grapes.</P>
<P>Secondly, We might al&s;o take it with Re&s;triction to &s;ome weak Chri&s;tians with tender Di&s;po&s;itions, which are always to be found in the Church, and that Je&s;us Chri&s;t con&s;iders his Vineyard in this View; or more compre|hen&s;ively for new erected Congregations, Vineyards as it were in their Bloom, and ju&s;t beginning to Bud, fill'd with young Converts, or young Chri&s;tians; emblemati|cally repre&s;ented by the Spring-Sea&s;on, every Thing being young and tender, and then above all other Times, the&s;e Foxes would prove mo&s;t de&s;tructive, and would &s;poil and take away all the Hopes of Fruit. This is even the

Ca&s;e with Re&s;pect to the Work of Grace in the People of God; for fal&s;e Teachers and Seducers, have not, nor cannot take &s;o much hold of, and have &s;o much Influence upon the more experienced and e&s;tabli&s;hed, as they can have upon the young unexperienced and le&s;s e&s;tabli&s;hed Believers, who by Rea&s;on of their Weakne&s;s cannot oppo&s;e them, and want Capacity to di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e Foxes; hence it will follow, that they are very ea&s;ily &s;educed. It is there|fore of the la&s;t Nece&s;&s;ity, in as much as the Lord's Vine|yard was full of the&s;e &s;mall ones, to have the&s;e pernicious Foxes taken, that their intended Mi&s;chief and De&s;truction to the&s;e Vines may be prevented.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Furthermore, we may take it in this Sen&s;e, <HI>Take us the Foxes &amp;c. for our Vines have tender Grapes:</HI> Which is as much as to &s;ay, We have a beautiful Pro&s;pect of much Fruit, and Hopes of a plentiful Harve&s;t; the young Grapes which appear, <HI>i. e.</HI> the Beginnings of Grace, give rea&s;onable Expectation of a further Growth to Per|fection: Take therefore the&s;e Foxes, which may di&s;ap|point our Hopes, and fru&s;trate our Expectations, without any Delay; and by this Means you will anticipate the Danger that threatens us in the Di&s;appointment of our Hope, and the Ruine of our Harve&s;t. This is therefore a &s;ufficient Motive for you to ha&s;ten in the Work.</P>
<P>Fourthly, We may take it in Point of Time, that as in the Spring of the Year, the Vineyards bud forth, and have tender Grapes, &s;o the Foxes then al&s;o bring forth their Young. So it is with the Church when &s;he flouri&s;hes, and is in her Bloom and Pro&s;perity; then al&s;o Hereticks, and Seducers, generally make their Appearance; and therefore it is as much as if the Lord &s;hould &s;ay, <HI>Vigila!</HI> Take Care! Now is the Sea&s;on that Foxes bring forth their Young; and if ever there be a Time to anticipate their Growth, and hinder their Increa&s;e, it is now when they make their fir&s;t Appearance: <HI>Take us the Foxes, the little Foxes, that &s;poil the Vines, for our Vines have tender Grapes.</HI></P>

of that tender Care which he has for his Church, and more e&s;pecially for tho&s;e that are the weake&s;t of his Peo|ple; a Charge very nece&s;&s;ary to be put in Execution at all Times; but if ever there was a Time, that loudly called for this Duty, we may &s;ay it is NOW. Certainly there have been in all Ages of the Church &s;uch mi&s;chievous FOXES to the Vines. In the early Times of Chri&s;tianity they were very numerous; they fir&s;t &s;prang from both Jews and Gentiles, when the Vineyard was full of tender Grapes, <HI>i. e.</HI> full of young Converts, and many &s;imple Ones: Then the Devil was exceeding bu&s;y every where to rai&s;e up, and animate Foxes of all Sorts and Sizes; and tho' one might ob&s;erve &s;ome Difference in their Heads, yet it &s;eems they could join their wicked Tails together, and by the Fire-Brands of Contention, Here&s;y and Schi&s;m, &s;et Fire to the &s;tanding Corn of the Church of Chri&s;t. The erroneous Opinions, and Relicks of Knowledge, fal&s;ly &s;o called, of the Jewi&s;h Rabbies, and of the many Sects among the Heathen Philo&s;ophers, were carried over by Pro&s;elytes into the Church; and the&s;e proved to be the Ne&s;ts and Holes which ingendred many Foxes, and which &s;pread over all the &s;piritual Vineyards from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, till at la&s;t Antichri&s;t gathered up the&s;e Fox-Skins, and tacked them together, to make him&s;elf a Garment; and moreover, put on an Out-Coat of a fierce Lyon-Skin, whereby he brought De&s;olation upon the whole Church.</P>
<P>And when at the Time of the Reformation, the pure Church had wrenched her &s;elf again out of his Clutches, and the bright Day of Truth &s;hone forth, we pre&s;ently beheld again in another Spring-Time, new Fox-Holes breaking out; and it is hardly expre&s;&s;ible what Number of Foxes, both great and &s;mall, have appeared to &s;poil the <HI>New Vineyards</HI> of the Reformation: the Wounds the &s;ame has received, by the numerous Sects, and Schi&s;ms, are not yet healed. What do I &s;ay, healed! if ever there was a Time &s;ince the Creation, in which it might be &s;aid the Church <HI>crawls</HI> with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Kinds of Foxes, we mu&s;t confe&s;s it is even in our Day. There &s;carce ever

was an Error in ancient Times, but what is now raked up again, and with the Addition of many new ones; no Opinions, tho' ever &s;o ab&s;urd, but what are broached, and &s;ome are influenced by them, and appear for their Defence; &s;o that without mentioning old Errors, we have new ones turned out, Time after Time.</P>
<P>The Abu&s;e, or ill U&s;e, that was made of Philo&s;ophy, and natural Rea&s;on, was that accur&s;ed Hole which the mo&s;t of the Foxes crept out at, in the primitive Church, and who wa&s;ted and trampled it under Foot; the &s;ame is now opened afre&s;h, and wider than ever, and out of it come a Swarm of Athei&s;ts, of Libertines, and of Men who&s;e Mouths &s;peak Bla&s;phemy, and teach Doctrines again&s;t the Divinity and Authority of the holy Scriptures, again&s;t God him&s;elf and many of his excellent Perfections, again&s;t his eternal Decrees, again&s;t the deep My&s;teries of the Go&s;pel, and again&s;t almo&s;t an endle&s;s Number of the fundamental Doctrines of Truth. The Books which daily fill the World with Error, the hidden Holes and Corners, which hatch and breed Impo&s;tors the Com|pilers of them, and by which Means their erronious Opinions are &s;pread, are almo&s;t endle&s;s; great and little Foxes do &s;pring out of it, both without and within the Church. And if they are &s;uffered to go on without Op|po&s;ition, Truth is not only threatned to be born down, but even with a total Subver&s;ion. And have we not &s;uffered Encroachment enough already? Fir&s;t, By what is pa&s;t Truth has received &s;uch a Wound, that in many Re&s;pects it's almo&s;t incurable; many have embraced Lyes in&s;tead of Truth, at lea&s;t there is &s;uch a general Lukewarmne&s;s, Coldne&s;s, and Indifferency, and in many Re&s;pects &s;uch a Want of Love to Truth, which cannot be de&s;cribed. Secondly, True Piety in a great Mea&s;ure has lo&s;t her Lu&s;tre and Tenderne&s;s; the inward Work of Grace in the Soul, and the e&s;&s;ential Power of true Godline&s;s, is ridiculed, and by &s;ome denied. Thirdly, The Wor&s;hip of God is become like a mere Skeleton without a Spirit, a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rment of outward Profe&s;&s;ors, a meer Mode of the Times, and a Badge of a fa&s;hionable
<PB N="27" REF="005299_0183_1016F8DE80B1D758">
Man, but the Life and Truth of it decays. Fourthly, Unity and brotherly Love, that grand Mark of true Chri&s;tianity, is &s;adly depre&s;&s;ed; Bitterne&s;s, Uncharita|blene&s;s, Parties, and Schi&s;ms, have as it were rent the Body of the Church to Pieces. Fifthly, By the&s;e Means the Growth and farther Propagation of the Church, both within and without, is wonderfully check'd. Sixthly, Spiritual Fruitfulne&s;s is much retarded. Seventhly, The Bloom and &s;hining Beauties of the Church decay. Eighthly, She loo&s;es her Security and Strength. Ninthly, Yea how many Souls may be lo&s;t by the&s;e Means, may be gue&s;&s;ed at, from the natural Con&s;equences of Things, and the lamentable Condition the Church is now fallen into.</P>
<P>And O! if there were but a <HI>Zeal</HI> to take the&s;e Foxes; but alas in this too great a Slackne&s;s prevails.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks are in many Re&s;pects too &s;lack-handed in this; or perhaps their Hearts are not enough united to the Truth. Church-Di&s;cipline, by which &s;uch Foxes &s;hould be taken, is often &s;adly neglected. It were to be wi&s;hed, that Pre&s;byteries and Synods, made it more their principal and grand Concern, to inquire into tho&s;e Things, while they wa&s;te their Time about Things of much le&s;&s;er Moment; certainly we are often too carele&s;s and unwatchful again&s;t pernicious Foxes: tho&s;e who have a true Heart for Zion, are often obliged to &s;it down and mourn in Silence becau&s;e of this.</P>
<P>Secondly, Particular Profe&s;&s;ors have little or no Capa|city, or they have no Courage to oppo&s;e Foxes. What fine Di&s;putants had we in former Congregations, who dar'd to appear again&s;t Oppo&s;ers, and clo&s;ely to attack them; who were not afraid to thru&s;t forth their Hands into the&s;e Cockatrice-Holes; and who could divert them|&s;elves over the Ne&s;ts of tho&s;e Vipers without Danger; and who dar'd to approach and enter into their A&s;&s;emblies, and Meetings, and publickly lay hold of them in Debates! But this Zeal, and even &s;uch a Capacity, is mo&s;tly gone, or rarely to be found: The old antiquated Meekne&s;s &amp; For|bearance towards the Remon&s;trants is now again revived; a
<PB N="28" REF="005299_0184_1016F8E0076061C8">
Spirit of Lukewarmne&s;s and Indifference begins to prevail in our Day; every one enjoys his Opinion freely, without being &s;o much as &s;poken again&s;t; and by this Means we &s;uffer the Foxes to gain Ground, to the apparent Ruin of the Lord's Vineyard. O! what a mi&s;taken, as well as &s;inful Practice is this? Fir&s;t, This is running counter to the <HI>Command of Chri&s;t,</HI> who will have all Foxes to be taken, none excu&s;ed, even to the &s;malle&s;t. Indeed where we our &s;elves are mi&s;-u&s;ed, in Charity we ought to be conde&s;cending and bear much; but in no wi&s;e when God and his &s;acred Truths are abu&s;ed; in this Ca&s;e we mu&s;t not let one Claw of them e&s;cape. Secondly, It is a mo&s;t barbarous Kind of Clemency, as it is the Concern of immortal Souls, and our Vineyards have &s;o many tender Grapes. Surely one of tho&s;e will weigh down a thou&s;and Foxes. Would you then &s;pare the Foxes, and let &s;o many precious Souls be de&s;troyed? O! wo, wo unto &s;uch a perver&s;e Pity. Thirdly, What will become of Truth? If you &s;uffer them to go on at this Rate, they will &s;poil the whole Vineyard, they will tear every Thing up by the Roots in &s;uch a Manner that no Appea|rance of Truth will remain; and it may be the Lord him&s;elf will come, and make her a De&s;olation by taking away her Fences, and leaving her to be trampled under Foot, and ruined by wild Bea&s;ts; even as it befell the Ea&s;tern Church, when from one Degree to another, they fell from Truth, the Lord &s;uffered her at la&s;t &s;o to fall away, that there are no Remains of her to be found.</P>
<P>O! that the whole Body of the Chri&s;tian World were rou&s;ed to look into this. Men are in a deep <HI>Lethargy,</HI> a profound Sleep of Indifferency hath &s;eized upon the Church: In the mean Time, the Enemy is bu&s;y, and is &s;owing of <HI>Tares</HI> among the <HI>Wheat,</HI> Matth. 13.25. And it is high Time to awake, before the&s;e Tares choak the Wheat, and quite overcome it. Well then, in the fir&s;t Place, don't think it a &s;trange Thing when you hear and &s;ee that there are Foxes in the Vineyard; it has always been &s;o, the Lord Je&s;us and his Apo&s;tles, have foretold this, 1 Cor. 11.10. <HI>For there mu&s;t be al&s;o Here&s;ies among
<PB N="29" REF="005299_0185_1016F8E336A1AFF0">
you, that they which are approved, may be made manife&s;t among you.</HI> Secondly, Be always upon your Guard, that you may not be injured by Foxes; beware of their <HI>Per&s;ons,</HI> beware of their <HI>Doctrines:</HI> This is the Le&s;&s;on &amp; Precept of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, Mark 13.22, 23. <HI>For fal&s;e Chri&s;ts, and fal&s;e Prophets &s;hall ari&s;e, and &s;hall &s;hew Signs, and Wonders, to &s;educe if it were po&s;&s;ible, even the Elect: But take ye Heed, behold I have foretold you all the&s;e Things.</HI> And St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Let no Man deceive you with vain Words,</HI> Eph. 5.6. Thirdly, To this End, don't content your &s;elves to remain tender Grapes, like weak and young Children; &s;uch as &s;tand thus loo&s;e are in great Danger, and more expo&s;ed to be &s;educed and ruined. This St. <HI>Peter</HI> tells us, that <HI>fal&s;e Teachers</HI> before all others, beguile <HI>un&s;table Souls,</HI> 2 Pet. 2.14. And St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;peaks of &s;uch in the Church, which are but Children, that they are <HI>to&s;t to and fro, and carried about with every Wind of Doctrine, by the Sleight of Men, and cunning Craftine&s;s, whereby they lie in wait to deceive.</HI> And further &s;hews, that the only Mean again&s;t this is, to follow after Truth, that we may <HI>grow up into him in all Things which is the Head:</HI> And &s;o come unto <HI>a perfect Man, unto the Mea&s;ure of the Stature of the Fulne&s;s of Chri&s;t,</HI> Eph. 4.13, 14, 15. Well, follow ye this Advice then, that you may become Men and Fathers in Chri&s;t, that you may have your Sen&s;es exerci&s;ed, to di&s;cern <HI>both Good and Evil,</HI> Heb. 5.14. that you may not <HI>believe every Spirit, but try the Spirits whether they are of God: becau&s;e many fal&s;e Prophets are gone out into the World,</HI> 1 Joh. 4.1. Fourthly, Take heed that you do not by a &s;luggi&s;h Patience, a &s;inful Carele&s;ne&s;s, and a lukewarm Indifferency, give Opportunity for Foxes to propagate and multiply in the Vineyard; but be always ju&s;tly apprehen&s;ive that Foxes are more mi&s;chievous to the Church than Lions, and Hereticks more de&s;tructive than Per&s;ecutors; for under Per&s;ecutions the Church grows purer, and often flouri&s;hes and increa&s;es the more: <HI>Sanguis Martyrum e&s;t &s;emen Eccle&s;iae;</HI> the Blood of the Martyrs is the Seed of the Church; but through Here&s;y &s;he always grows wor&s;e: they kill but the Body, but the&s;e murder

the Soul: therefore never conde&s;cend in the lea&s;t in this Matter. This was the Sin of the Church of <HI>Thyatira;</HI> and this was that which Je&s;us had again&s;t her, that they <HI>&s;uffered the Woman</HI> Jezebel, <HI>which called her&s;elf a Pro|phete&s;s, to teach and &s;educe his Servants,</HI> Rev. 2.20. Therefore be ye not like unto them. Fifthly, On the contrary be diligent in your Duty; take the&s;e Foxes which are in the Church.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t to this End, Over&s;eers of the Church, Elders and Deacons, Pre&s;byteries and Synods, &s;hould all go Hand in Hand, above all Things to watch again&s;t the Encroach|ments of Error. No Jarrings or Animo&s;ities concerning other Things, &s;hould ever be in the Way of &s;o great and nece&s;&s;ary a Work. Tho' there were &s;ome Difference in Judgment about le&s;&s;er Matters, yet if they agreed in the main and fundamental Points, then they &s;hould al&s;o agree in this grand Article, with one Accord to watch again&s;t Foxes that creep in: It is for this End they are &s;et, as Over&s;eers of the Vineyard; and for this End, the Care and watching over Souls, is commended to them by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. O! be careful then, that you do not betray this great Tru&s;t of your Ma&s;ter, in proving unfaithful to his Vineyard; for if but one Fox &s;hould carry away a Soul as a Prey, the &s;ame he will require at your Hands.</P>
<P>Secondly, Yea every Profe&s;&s;or of the Church &s;hould &s;eek to be faithful in this Behalf. You are al&s;o com|manded, <HI>Take us the Foxes.</HI> Endeavour therefore after Ability for the Work: that you may di&s;tingui&s;h Truth from Fal&s;hood; and to di&s;cover tho&s;e that are in Error; and that you may be able to confute them and &s;top their Mouths, endeavour after Courage and Confidence to per|form this Duty. You &s;hould not only have a Will to do, but Boldne&s;s to execute. Remember that you have a high Commi&s;&s;ion, therefore fear no Man: He who hath commanded you, will &s;tand by you. <HI>Be ye &s;trong, and the Lord</HI> of the Vineyard <HI>&s;hall be with you.</HI></P>
<P>Behold, if after thou ha&s;t done thy Duty, and there &s;hould be &s;till Foxes remaining, the Lord however will pre&s;erve his Vineyard; e&s;pecially he will watch over you
