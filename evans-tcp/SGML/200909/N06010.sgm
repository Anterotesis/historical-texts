<P><HI>In the Preface of the form of Church Government, Page 4 they &s;ay,</HI> That we might Stand Perfect, and Compleat in all the Will of GOD, and we tru&s;t it is our &s;incere De&s;ire that His Will, all His Will, and nothing el&s;e but His Will, might be done among us to the Law, and to the Te&s;timony we do wholly refer our &s;elves, and if any thing in the following Conclu&s;ion be Indeed found not to Speak according thereunto let it be Rejected: <HI>The&s;e Words to the Law,

<P>Thus far I have Quoted out of each Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, and they both re|fer us to the holy Scriptures, and not barely to take upon tru&s;t from their Word; and I have compared both &s;aid Con|fe&s;&s;ions together, and they are both one, being Chapter for Chapter, Paragraph for Paragraph, Word for Word, (mi&s;takes in Printing excepted.) But in as much as in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> Confe&s;&s;ion, they have not brought one Text to prove one Article, throughout their whole Confe&s;&s;ion. I have therefore made u&s;e of &s;ome Scrip|ture Proof's out of <HI>Connecticut</HI> Con|fe&s;&s;ion to Confute both, they being both one, as is &s;aid Word, for Word; and they are Approved, and E&s;tabli&s;h|ed by the General Courts in each Colony.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, the Elders, and Me&s;&s;engers of each Colony have Recommended them to the civil Government; and the civil
<PB N="23" REF="007622_0021_102BAB6006D2CBB0">
Governments have taken them under their Protection to Defend them, that both Elders, and Me&s;&s;engers, and &s;aid General Courts, and civil Governments as they own and defend them, they all &s;tand equally charged with an An&s;wer.</P>
<P>Now let us take their Advice as was before Quoted; as al&s;o their Ad|vice in &s;aid Preface, Page 8. <HI>And com|mend the &s;ame to your diligent Peru&s;al that you be E&s;tabli&s;hed in the Truth, and your Faith re&s;t upon it's proper Ba&s;es, the Word of GOD. Follow the example of the Noble Bereans, Search the Scriptures,</HI> &amp;c. Acts 17, 11. <HI>The&s;e were more Noble than tho&s;e in The&s;&s;alonica, in that they received the Word with all rea|dine&s;s of Mind, and &s;earched the Scriptures daily whether tho&s;e things were &s;o,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And now under the Con&s;ideration, that I have Written to all the A&s;&s;ocia|tions in this Colony of <HI>Connecticut;</HI> and have Journeyed from County, to Coun|ty, and delivered in Writing to one of the Elders in each County, to be delivered to their &s;everal A&s;&s;ociations, as followeth.</P>

For as much as I have peru&s;ed &s;aid Confe&s;&s;ion, and to me it appears, that there are many dangerous, and hurtful Principles, &s;ome of which I have Quo|ted, and pre&s;ented before &s;aid Elders, to be delivered to their &s;everal A&s;&s;oci|ations de&s;iring their further peru&s;al, and if they appear not to have Scripture Foundation, that they would Rectify them, but they di&s;regarded my Reque&s;t.</P>
<P>I therefore went to the General Court, to de&s;ire Them, under the Con&s;ideration of the danger of being &s;eated upon, and contending for un&s;ound Principles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> To put &s;aid Elders forward, to An&s;wer my Reque&s;t, which was as little Re|garded as the other. And this is now near <HI>thirty Years</HI> pa&s;t; and each Go|vernment goes on &s;till in approving and defending each Confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>And now GOD hath put it into my Heart, to reprove both Governments, by your own Confe&s;&s;ions; by Rehear&s;ing &s;undry of your Articles, and proving them to contradict the Scriptures; and &s;ome to wre&s;t the Scriptures, and to teach another Doctrine than what was originally Given, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="007622_0023_102BAB62AA5203D0">
But before I go any further, I think it not ami&s;s to give &s;ome Account of my own Life from my Infancy, and of GOD's Dealing towards me; as <HI>David</HI> &s;aith, P&s;al. 66.16. <HI>Come and hear all ye that fear GOD, and I will tell you what He hath done for my Soul.</HI> That was his Experiences of GOD's Goodne&s;s towards him. And as to my &s;elf, my Father lived about a Mile out of <HI>New-London</HI> Town; and my Mother was at home with only three little Children, I being the Younge&s;t (about 10 Months old) &s;he with the other two were Mur|dered by a youth about 16 years of Age, who was afterwards Executed at <HI>Hartford;</HI> and I was found (as was &s;aid) at my dead Mothers Brea&s;t.</P>
<P>And &s;ince in the cour&s;e of my Life GOD hath pre&s;erved me out of many eminent Dangers, when there was but a Hairs breadth between Me and Death, which I have a particular Remembrance of to this Day; and the mo&s;t of them by Water. And I was brought up in the <HI>Pre&s;byterian</HI> way till I was about thirty Years old, and had four or five Children, but Bapti&s;ed none; for reading the Scriptures, and as my Age gave me
<PB N="26" REF="007622_0024_102BAB855780EC08">
under&s;tanding to con&s;ider what I Read. It appeared to me by the Scriptures, that we mu&s;t fir&s;t Believe, before we were Bapti&s;ed, and in our Bapti&s;m we mu&s;t be Buried in Water. And now living to this Age in the neglect of Bapti&s;m, my Con&s;cience accu&s;ed me, &s;o that I read the Scriptures that I might be fully Informed what was for me to do. And the more I read them, I was confirmed in my fir&s;t Belief, and accor|dingly was Bapti&s;ed by <HI>John Rogers,</HI> a Bapti&s;t Teacher.</P>
<P>And now as I had made a Profe&s;&s;ion thus far, and going on in my Chri&s;tian Progre&s;s, I found no command in Scrip|ture for the fir&s;t day Sabbath; and therefore began to Work upon it, not thinking that the civil Authority would ri&s;e up again&s;t me. For though I was Bapti&s;ed by &s;aid <HI>Rogers,</HI> and joined in Fellow&s;hip with that People that had &s;uffered much for Con&s;cience &s;ake, by Whipping, Impri&s;oning and &s;etting in the Stocks, and lo&s;s of Goods, and particularly, for Working on the fir&s;t Day of the Week; yet of late, they had not been Mole&s;ted as at the fir&s;t, though they Work't as freely, and

openly: but I was &s;oon Pre&s;ented, and brought before the Authority, and Fined, and then they would let me alone till after three fir&s;t Day and then &s;end for me, and Fine me, for three Days together; and now as the Battle grew hotter GOD gave me more Courage, and I grew &s;tronger, and &s;tronger, that what was &s;aid of I&s;rael under the Oppre&s;&s;ion of Pharaoh, and the Egyptians was very lively with me, Exod. 1, 12. <HI>But the more they Afflicted them the more they Multiplied, and Grew;</HI> as al&s;o that of the Hou&s;e of Saul, and David, 2 Sam. 3, 1. <HI>Now there was long War between the Hou&s;e of Saul, and the Hou&s;e of David, but David waxed &s;tronger, and &s;tronger, and the Hou&s;e of Saul weaker, and weaker;</HI> and &s;o it has proved be|tween me, and the Authority, for the Con&s;olation that I injoyed, &s;et me over the lo&s;s of my Goods, and herein I could Witne&s;s with the Apo&s;tle, 2 Cor; 1, 5. <HI>For as the Sufferings of CHRIST Abound in us, &s;o our Con&s;olation al&s;o A|boundeth by CHRIST;</HI> for GOD gave me &s;uch a chearful Spirit in this Warfare, that when I had not the Knowlege that the Grand-Jury man &s;aw me at Work,

<HEAD>Concerning the Sabbath, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>In your Confe&s;&s;ions Chapter 22. 7 Paragraph, you &s;ay,&mdash;<HI>So by His Word in a po&s;itive moral, and perpetual Commandment, binding all Men in all Ages, He hath particularly appointed one day in &s;even for a Sabbath to be kept Holy unto Him, which from the begin|ning of the World to the Re&s;urrection of</HI> CHRIST, (you &s;ay) <HI>was the la&s;t day of the Week, and from the Re&s;urrection of</HI> CHRIST (you &s;ay) <HI>was changed into the fir&s;t day of the Week, which in Scripture</HI> (you al&s;o &s;ay) <HI>is called the Lord's-Day.</HI></P>
<P>An&s;wer,</P>
<P>Whereas you &s;ay, <HI>So by His Word in a po&s;itive, moral and perpetual Command|ment, binding all Men, in all Ages, He hath particularly appointed one day in &s;even for a Sabbath to be kept Holy unto Him,</HI> &amp;c. This is making GOD's Com|mandment of none Effect, which &s;aith Expre&s;ly, Exod. 20.9, 10. <HI>Six Days &s;halt thou Labour, and do all thy Work, but the &s;eventh Day is the Sabbath of the LORD thy GOD, in it thou

&s;halt not do any Work,</HI> &amp;c. But you open a Door of Liberty for every Man to Chu&s;e which Day of the Se|ven he will keep for a Sabbath, and then &s;et up your own Choice for the fir&s;t Day of the Week, without the lea&s;t word in Scripture for it, and Require all Men to Conform to it.</P>
<P>Secondly, you &s;ay,&mdash;<HI>Which from the beginning of the World, to the Re|&s;urrection of</HI> CHRIST was the la&s;t Day of the Week.</P>
<P>An&s;wer,</P>
<P>There is Evening and Morning a|&s;cribed to all the &s;ix Days in which GOD Created all Things, Gen. 1. But to the &s;eventh Day when GOD had fini&s;hed all His Works, there is no Evening nor Morning a&s;cribed to it, which &s;hews it was not reckoned with the other &s;ix Days; and as the Scriptures inform us, Man was the la&s;t thing GOD Made, or His fini&s;hing Work: &s;o that, that Mom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">t that GOD Breathed into his No&s;trils the Breath of Life, by which he became a living Soul, he immediately

entered into GOD's Re&s;t, or Sabbath, that had no Evening, or Morning a&s;|cribed to it, even a perpetual Re&s;t; it was no Re&s;t to Adam from any Work that he had done, for he had done no Work to Re&s;t from; but it was GOD's Re&s;t, or Sabbath, that GOD put Adam in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, when he was fir&s;t Cre|ated, even the Day he Ble&s;&s;ed, and Sanctified, Chap. 2. ver. 3. <HI>And GOD Ble&s;&s;ed the &s;eventh Day, and Sanctified it, becau&s;e that in it He had Re&s;ted from all His Work, which GOD Created and Made.</HI> And as to the length of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> that Adam continued in GOD's Re&s;t or Sabbath; the Scripture is &s;ilent, neither is it needful for us to know but to know this, that GOD Created Adam in a &s;tate of Innocency, and &s;et him in his own Re&s;t, and through his Di&s;obedience was turned out of it, to Eat his Bread by the Sweat of his Face; and we Read of no weekly, or &s;even Day Sabbath required of Man to be Kept, till in <HI>Exod.</HI> 16. When GOD fir&s;t gave I&s;rael Manna, then he &s;et a part the &s;eventh Day for a Sabbath, &s;ee ver. 26. <HI>Six Days ye &s;hall gather it, but on the &s;eventh Day which is the Sabbath,
<PB N="32" REF="007622_0030_102BAB8BE3320E38">
in it there &s;hall be none.</HI> And it is good Evidence to us, that they had not lived in the practice of keeping a &s;eventh Day Sabbath, nor that they had any knowlege of it till now, by their Aver&s;ene&s;s to it, as in Ver. 27. <HI>And it came to pa&s;s that there went out &s;ome of the People on the &s;eventh Day for to gather, and they found none.</HI> Ver. 28, 29. <HI>And the Lord &s;aid unto Mo&s;es, how long refu&s;e ye to keep my Command|ments and my Laws: See for that the Lord hath given you the Sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the &s;ixth Day, the Bread of two Days; abide ye every Man in his place, let no Man go out of his place on the &s;eventh Day.</HI> And for a final Confirmation, let us take <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s Te&s;timony, Deut. 5.2, 3. <HI>The Lord our God made a Covenant with us in Horeb, the Lord made not this Cove|nant with our Fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this Day.</HI></P>
<P>Thus it is &s;ufficiently Proved that GOD's Church had no &s;ix Days Labour, and &s;eventh Day Sabbath given them to be ob&s;erved, till it was given by
<PB N="33" REF="007622_0031_102BABC3B38894C8">
<HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> which by Scripture Date was 2513 Years after the beginning of the World.</P>
<P>And as to your Scripture Proof, Exod. 20, 8, to 11. <HI>Remember the Sabbath-Day, to keep it Holy, &s;ix Days &s;halt thou La|bour, and do all thy Work, but the &s;e|venth Day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God, in it thou &s;halt not do any Work, Thou, nor thy Son, nor thy Daughter, thy Man-Servant, nor thy Maid-Servant, nor thy Cattle, nor thy Stranger that is within thy Gates, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In the 16th Chap. we read only of their being forbidden to gather <HI>Manna</HI> on the &s;eventh Day, or Sabbath; but now in this Text all manner of Labour is expre&s;ly forbidden; and the Rea&s;on is given, in Ver, 11. <HI>For in &s;ix Days the Lord made Heaven and Earth, the Sea and all that in them is, and re&s;ted the &s;eventh Day, wherefore the Lord Ble&s;|&s;ed the Sabbath Day and hallowed it.</HI></P>
<P>Here we &s;ee <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in E&s;tabli&s;hing the &s;eventh Day Sabbath to <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> puts them in mind how that in &s;ix Days the Lord made Heaven and Earth, the
<PB N="34" REF="007622_0032_102BAB8D64F00248">
Sea and all that in them is, and re&s;ted the &s;eventh Day; wherefore (&s;aith he) the Lord Ble&s;&s;ed the Sabbath Day and Hallowed it.</P>
<P>And in this Ble&s;&s;ed and Sanctified Day of GOD's Re&s;t it was, that <HI>Adam</HI>'s Happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ted, &s;o long as he con|tinued in Innocency, but he for his Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion was turned out of it, to eat his Bread by the Sweat of his Face: and this Ble&s;&s;ed Day of Plea&s;ure and Delight, was turned into a Cur&s;ed Day of Labour and Sorrow, not to <HI>Adam</HI> only, but to all his Po&s;terity de&s;cending by natural Generation. And in this &s;tate of Labour and Sorrow it was that <HI>I&s;rael</HI> underwent their Bondage in <HI>Egypt.</HI></P>
<P>Now let us con&s;ider the Rea&s;on given here for ob&s;erving the Sabbath, with that in Deut. 5.15. <HI>And Remember that thou wa&s;t a Servant in the Land of</HI> Egypt, <HI>and that the Lord thy God brought thee out thence, through a mighty Hand, and by a &s;tretched out Arm; therefore the Lord thy God Commanded thee to keep the Sabbath Day.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="007622_0033_102BABC6691019A8">
Thus we &s;ee the &s;eventh Day Sabbath was Commanded to <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> not only in Remembrance of the happy State that <HI>Adam</HI> &s;tood in whil&s;t in Innocency, before his Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; but al&s;o in Remem|brance of their Servitude in Egypt, and of GOD's Delivering them by His Mighty Hand, and Stretched out Arm, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And in Exod. 31.12, 13. <HI>And the Lord &s;pake unto Mo&s;es &s;aying, &s;peak thou unto the Children of I&s;rael, &s;aying, verily my Sabbaths ye &s;hall keep, for it is a Sign between me, and you, throughout your Generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth Sanctify you.</HI> Al&s;o, Ezek. 20.12. <HI>Moreover al&s;o I gave them my Sabbaths to be a Sign between me, and them, that they might know that I am the</HI> LORD <HI>that Sanctify them.</HI> Here we may &s;ee, by comparing the&s;e Texts that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> fir&s;t puts <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in mind of the Day of GOD's Re&s;t from His Works of Creation, which He Ble&s;&s;ed and Sanctified, which <HI>Adams</HI> Happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ted in, &s;o long as he continued in Innocency.</P>

<HI>Secondly,</HI> Of <HI>I&s;raels</HI> Bondage in Egypt, and of GOD's Delivering them, as afore|&s;aid.&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That the LORD gave them the &s;eventh Day Sabbath to keep as a Sign of GOD's bringing His Church and People into His &s;eventh Day Re&s;t, or Sabbath again, which had no Evening, or Morning a&s;cribed to it; or into His everla&s;ting Re&s;t, which <HI>Adam</HI> for his Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion was di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of: and of this Re&s;t or Sabbath, all the Faithful were Witne&s;&s;es, from <HI>Adam</HI> till <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> as CHRIST Te&s;tifieth, John 8.56. <HI>Your Father Abraham Rejoiced to &s;ee my Day, and he &s;aw it and was glad:</HI> That was through Faith he believed in the Promi&s;es as really as if he had &s;een them Fulfilled, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.17, 18, 19.

<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> You &s;ay, and from the Re|&s;urrection of CHRIST was changed into the fir&s;t Day of the Week, and for Proof quote Acts 20.7. <HI>And upon the fir&s;t day of the Week when the Di&s;ciples came together to break Bread, Paul Preached unto them ready to depart on the Morrow, and continued his Speech until Midnight.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="007622_0036_102BAB926FC537B0">
Now let us take your Advice, as in your Confe&s;&s;ions; Chap. 1. 9 Para|graph, you &s;ay; <HI>The infallible Rule of Interpretation of Scripture, is the Scrip|ture it Self,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now in as much as there is no Pre-eminence given to the Day; but called the fir&s;t Day of the Week, not Sabbath Day; and that their coming together was to break Bread: <HI>Paul Preached unto them,</HI> &amp;c. I &s;ee no further Interpretation of this text of Scripture, than that their coming toge|ther to break Bread, was in a Chri&s;tian Fellow&s;hip of Love; except it might be a more general Thing at this Time, <HI>Paul</HI> being there, and ready to depart on the Morrow, and to this it Agrees with other texts of Scripture, as in Chap. 2. 42. <HI>And they continued Sted|fa&s;t in the Apo&s;tles Doctrine, and in Fellow&s;hip, and in breaking of Bread, and in Prayers,</HI> ver. 46. <HI>And they con|tinuing Daily with one Accord in the Temple, and in breaking Bread from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, did eat their Meat with gladne&s;s, and &s;inglene&s;s of Heart;</HI> as al&s;o Jude 12. <HI>The&s;e are &s;pots, in your fea&s;ts

compar'd with ver. 6. <HI>But Brother goeth to Law with Brother, and that before the Unbelievers.</HI></P>
<P>Now, whereas you Quote, <HI>Rev.</HI> 1, 10. And &s;ay upon it, which in Scripture is called the Lord's-Day, and apply it to prove your fir&s;t Day Sabbath. I de&s;ire to know from what text of Scripture, you prove that the Title Lord's-Day is given to the fir&s;t Day of the Week, more than any other Day; or that any particular Day of the Week is intended by it?

your Advice, <HI>That the infallible Rule of In|terpretation of Scripture, is the Scripture it &s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>I proceed to prove, that the word Day, in Scripture, is not always to be limited to any particular Day in the Week, but the pre&s;ent Time: As in P&s;al. 95.7. <HI>To day if you will hear his voice, &amp;c.</HI> Ver. 8. <HI>Harden not your hearts, as in the provoca|tion; and as in the day of temptation in the wilderne&s;s;</HI> compar'd with ver. 10. <HI>Forty years long was I grieved with this genera|tion, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This Text informs us, that the Day here &s;poken of, contained the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI>'s Forty Years Travel in the Wilderne&s;s: Al&s;o P&s;al. 118.22, 23, 24. <HI>The Stone which the Builders refu&s;ed is become the head &s;tone of the Corner; this is the LORD'S Doing, it is mar|vellous in our Eyes: This is the Day which the</HI> LORD <HI>hath made, we will rejoice, and be glad in it.</HI></P>
<P>Here is the word Day u&s;ed, to &s;et forth GOD'S great Goodne&s;s to <HI>David,</HI> and to his Church, in de&s;troying their Enemies, and e&s;tabli&s;hing him on the Throne of his Kingdom. A Day which cannot be a&s;cri|bed to one &s;ingle Day, or to any particular

Day of the Week; but to that pre&s;ent Time wherein they enjoyed the Mercy there &s;poken of. As al&s;o 2 Cor. 6.2. <HI>For I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of &s;alvation have I &s;uccoured thee: Behold, now is the accepted time, behold now is the day of &s;alvation.</HI></P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee, the Text has no reference to any particular Day of the Week; but the pre&s;ent Time.</P>
<P>To conclude with the words of the Text, <HI>I was in the Spirit on the Lord's Day, &amp;c.</HI> is as much as if the Apo&s;tle had &s;aid, I was in the Spirit, or Spiritualized in the day of the LORD'S Appearing to me, and requiring me to write the Prophe&s;ies of this Book; which to our acceptation may be under|&s;tood, Time of the Lord's Appearing, compared with the fore cited Scriptures.</P>
<P>Thus you &s;ingle out only the&s;e words of the Apo&s;tle, <HI>I was in the Spirit on the Lord's Day, &amp;c.</HI> for the proof of your Fir&s;t-Day Sabbath; and add to the Text, and &s;ay, <HI>Which in Scripture is called the Lord's-Day,</HI> without proof either from this Text, or any other Scripture, that the Fir&s;t Day of the Week was ever &s;o intitled.</P>

<P>To this I An&s;wer: The Figurative Kingly Office of CHRIST was Prophe&s;ied to De&s;cend of <HI>Judah;</HI> Gen. 49.10. <HI>The &s;cepter &s;hall not depart from Judah, nor a law giver from between his feet until Shiloh come, and unto him &s;hall the ga|thering of the People be.</HI> Which was Fulfilled in <HI>David,</HI> and the Kings of <HI>Ju|dah</HI>

<P>We are to under&s;tand, that upon CHRIST's coming, the figurative King|ly Office of the Tribe of <HI>Judah</HI> was at an End; as is Witne&s;&s;ed by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> Deut. 18.15. <HI>The LORD thy GOD &s;hall rai&s;e up unto thee a Prophet from the mid&s;t of thee, of thy Brethren like unto me, unto him ye &s;hall Hearken:</HI> And this was confirmed by GOD Him&s;elf, Matth. 17.5. <HI>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well Plea&s;ed, hear ye him;</HI> as al&s;o Acts 3.22, <HI>For Mo&s;es truly &s;aid unto the Fathers,</HI> &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, <HI>a Prophet &s;hall the LORD your GOD rai&s;e up unto you of your Brethren like unto me, him &s;hall ye hear in all things what&s;oever he &s;hall &s;ay unto you.</HI></P>

<P>And why may not <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> Govern|ment, if it be true indeed, in that they &s;ay, <HI>The end of the Magi&s;trates Office is not only the quiet and peaceable Life of the Subject, in Matters of Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, and Hone&s;ty; but al&s;o in matters of Godline&s;s; yea of all Godline&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;ay then, why may not they de|vi&s;e, and make Laws according to their Di&s;cretion, in the defence, and for the pre&s;ervation of their &s;uppo&s;ed holy In|&s;titutions of Wor&s;hip; and accordingly proceed to do all the acts of Violence upon their fellow Creatures, as afore|&s;aid?</P>
<P>And why may not <HI>Connecticut Govern|ment</HI> al&s;o, if it be true, and from the Spirit of Truth, that they are CHRIST's Vice-gerents on Earth, <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioned and Sent,</HI> as they &s;ay, to <HI>defend his Cau&s;e, and do his Work.</HI> I &s;ay, if all this be true, have they not a good Warrant to devi&s;e, and make Laws according

to their own Di&s;cretion, and appoint &s;uch Puni&s;hments as they think proper for the breach of each Law, for the Support of their &s;uppo&s;ed holy In&s;titu|tions of Wor&s;hip; and accordingly pro|ceed to do all the afore&s;aid acts of Violence, upon their fellow Creatures?</P>
<P>Thus for <HI>Connecticut,</HI> and <HI>Bo&s;ton Go|vernment</HI>'s ASSEMBLY Prote&s;tants.</P>
<P><HI>England,</HI> in the Reign of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and &s;aid foreign Parts, being Papi&s;ts, the&s;e being Named as afore&s;aid; and each of them a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves hu|mane Authority, to rule over the Church of CHRIST, and Light of Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>And if we allow it to one, we mu&s;t allow it to all, one as much as another; and not only to the&s;e, but to all Papi&s;ts, and Prote&s;tants, throughout the World, even to all People that profe&s;s the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>For as CHRIST hath not limited Kingly Power to any particular People, now under the Go&s;pel Mini&s;tration, as GOD did to the Tribe of <HI>Judah</HI> under the Law; &s;o that throughout the World
<PB N="98" REF="007622_0096_102BAC345C5259D8">
where CHRIST is Named, whether Papi&s;ts, or Prote&s;tants; they have equal Right to &s;et up Kingly Authority to rule over the Church of GOD, as any of tho&s;e already Named, <HI>Viz.</HI> The Papi&s;ts in Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Reign, and tho&s;e in foreign Parts; and <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> Go|vernment, and <HI>Connecticut.</HI></P>
<P>And as I have thus given the Rea|der a brief View of the Works of each, I think the&s;e &s;ufficient to Judge them by their Works.</P>
<P>For as much as the Scripture &s;aith, <HI>In the Mouth of two, or three Wit|ne&s;&s;es, the Matter &s;hall be E&s;tabli&s;hed.</HI></P>
<P>But if we will Read the Hi&s;tory's Cited, we may &s;ee Hundreds more of unrighteous, and inhumane Actions done to the Sufferers: And many of them by the Officers.</P>

this is known by us yet Living, to have been the general Practice in <HI>Con|necticut.</HI></P>
<P>And now I de&s;ire every Chri&s;tian Reader, to give his Judgment particu|larly of the&s;e above Named, whether their proceedings again&s;t the Sufferers were not all of one Spirit? as for In&s;tance, one partly put to Death by Burning, another by Drowning, another by Hanging: Were not all the&s;e acts of Violence upon their fellow Creatures? I call for Judgment. CHRIST &s;aith, <HI>A good Tree cannot bring forth evil Fruit, neither can a corrupt Tree bring forth good Fruit.</HI> And &s;aith He, <HI>By their Fruits ye &s;hall know them.</HI> And the Apo&s;tle &s;aith, Rev. 13.15. <HI>He</HI> (that is the Dragon) <HI>had power to give life unto the image of the Bea&s;t, that the image of the Bea&s;t &s;hould both &s;peak, and cau&s;e that as many as would not Wor&s;hip the image of the Bea&s;t &s;hould be Killed.</HI></P>
<P>And here we &s;ee the Apo&s;tles Pro|phecy fulfilled: And in differing ways in <HI>Connecticut Confe&s;&s;ion,</HI> Chap. 24. they

Quote to <HI>Rom.</HI> 13. and Tit. 3.1. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.13, 14, 17. to prove the civil Magi&s;trates Authority to rule in the Church.

<P>Thus they borrow the heathen Ma|gi&s;trates Authority, that required the Wor&s;hipping of Idols to rule, and govern the Church under a conformity to their &s;everal In&s;titutions of Wor&s;hip; and &s;o u&s;e the carnal Sword to defend their own In&s;titutions, as the Heathen did their's.</P>
<P>And thus the Dragon's Head that was wounded to Death, by the light of the Go&s;pel in the time of the pri|mitive Church, now comes to be hea|led, by the falling away of the Church in Antichri&s;tiani&s;m: But it is the &s;ame Dragon and &s;ame per&s;ecuting Spirit that required the Wor&s;hipping of Idols, and per&s;ecuted the primitive Church, that now profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf to be a Chri&s;tian, and furni&s;hes him&s;elf with

<P>And thus as we &s;ee by the Scrip|tures, the Antichri&s;tian Church Anoti|mized, and laid Naked before our Eyes.</P>

In the foregoing Treati&s;e, the Rea|der may &s;ee how I have formerly been with the Elders and Me&s;&s;engers, and General Courts of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> with this Scruple, that &s;undry Articles in their Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith had not Scrip|ture Proof, but they regarded it not, and in the Year 1754, I went to the General Court at <HI>Hartford,</HI> and al&s;o to the General Court at <HI>Bo&s;ton;</HI> con&s;idering their Confe&s;&s;ions were both one; and that both Governments lie under the &s;ame Reproof that they would peru&s;e them, and con&s;ider them, but neither of them regarded, &s;o as to enquire into them.</P>
<P>And I have publi&s;hed three Treati&s;es already, touching the&s;e Things; but there has been no An&s;wer made to any; and this is the Fourth; that after &s;o much Proof, I think it may truly be &s;aid of them, as in Rev. 2.2. <HI>And thou ha&s;t tried them which &s;ay they are Apo&s;tles, and are not, and ha&s;t found them Lyars.</HI></P>
<P>Lyars Indeed, both to GOD, and Man, to give forth &s;uch a Body of Articles of Faith for our rule of Life,

that are &s;o contrary to Scripture, and again&s;t the plain commands of CHRIST as words can expre&s;s; and yet recom|mend them to us, and to our Po&s;terity, as the unchangeable, and eternal Truths of GOD, founded upon the holy Scrip|tures.</P>
<P>See <HI>Connecticut Preface,</HI> Page 8. And much more to this Purpo&s;e, I have quoted out of &s;aid <HI>Preface,</HI> as the Rea|der may &s;ee; and they &s;ay, that <HI>GOD alone is LORD of the Con&s;cience:</HI> And <HI>hath le&s;t it free from the Doctrines, and Commandments of Men,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And then &s;et up their own Doctrines, and Commandments to be ob&s;erved, and leave it to carnal Men to devi&s;e what Puni&s;hments &s;hall be Inflicted upon the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, in defence of &s;aid Doc|trines, and Impower the Civil Magi&s;|trate to execute them again&s;t the revea|led Will of GOD in the Heart, which is the light of Con&s;cience, and &s;o give GOD the Title of Lord-&s;hip, but make them&s;elves Lord of the Con&s;cience, by &s;ubjecting it under their humane Laws, and carnal Weapons, by the Power,
<PB N="105" REF="007622_0103_102BAC04ECD2B758">
and Authority received from the Dra|gon, as in Rev. 13.2. <HI>And the Dra|gon gave him his Power, and his Seat, and great Authority.</HI></P>
<P>And from this Spirit of Per&s;ecution received from the Dragon, proceeds all Per&s;ecution, that ari&s;es where CHRIST is Received; even &s;o as to make divi|&s;ions between neare&s;t Relations, in Fa|milies, <HI>Matth.</HI> 10.34. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and it is al&s;o hurtful to Kingdoms and common Wealths, to mole&s;t People that live Hone&s;tly, and are diligent in their law|ful Employments, and live under confor|mity to all Things, relating to the good and benefit of the common Wealth, ex|cepting tho&s;e Things that they Scruple for Con&s;cience &s;ake towards GOD; as in the ca&s;e of <HI>Daniel, Dan.</HI> 6.5.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, to mole&s;t &s;uch, by injuring either their Per&s;ons, or E&s;tates, is &s;o far violating the peace, and good of the common Wealth, which the civil Magi&s;trates Work is to Pre&s;erve.</P>
<P>In a word, to go to rule the Church by the power of the Magi&s;trate, is to
<PB N="106" REF="007622_0104_102BAC3D603FD048">
de&s;troy the peace of both Church, Fa|milies, and common Wealths. But on the contrary, CHRIST is &s;aid to be <HI>the Prince of Peace,</HI> I&s;a. 9.6. And when he was Born into the World, this Te&s;timony was given of him from Heaven, Luke 2.13, 14. <HI>And &s;uddenly there was with the Angel, a Multitude of the Heavenly Ho&s;t, prai&s;ing GOD, and &s;aying, glory to GOD in the Highe&s;t, and on Earth peace, good will towards Men.</HI> As al&s;o, Rom. 10.15. <HI>As it is Written, how Beautiful are the Feet of them that preach the Go&s;pel of Peace, and bring glad Tidings of good Things.</HI></P>
<P>And all that walk in his Spirit, fol|low his Example, to <HI>live peaceably to|ward all Men,</HI> as al&s;o toward the com|mon Wealth, and to pay Tribute, as he did, for Peace &s;ake, rather than to offend, <HI>Matth.</HI> 17.24. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But not as a due Debt; for &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, Tim. 1.9. <HI>The Law is not made for a Righteous Man,</HI> but &s;aith he, <HI>for the Lawle&s;s, and Di&s;obedient, for the Ungodly, and for Sinners,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="007622_0105_102BAC07F092EBD8">
Thus it appears by this Text, that the Law is not made for the Righteous, and they are therefore not Indebted to the Law, &s;o as to pay Tribute, or the like, as a due Debt, but as a free, and voluntary Act, for Peace &s;ake, ra|ther than to Offend.</P>
<P>There is no Compul&s;ion in CHRIST's Church, neither towards GOD, nor Man; but every Man, to whom it is given, is at his own free Will, to Chu&s;e, or Refu&s;e for him&s;elf; as 2 Cor. 5.20. <HI>We are Amba&s;&s;adors for CHRIST,</HI> &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, <HI>as th&ocirc; GOD did be&s;eech you by us, we pray you in CHRIST's Stead, be ye reconciled to GOD.</HI> Rev. 22.17. <HI>The Spirit and the Bride &s;ay Come, and let him that heareth &s;ay Come, and let him that is a thir&s;t Come, and who&s;oever will, let him take of the wa|ter of Life freely.</HI></P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee, tho' all Power was given to CHRIST, as He &s;aith, <HI>Both in Heaven, and Earth,</HI> Matth. 28.18. Yet the Foundation of his Church is Love; as he &s;aith, John 3.16. <HI>God &s;o loved the World, that he gave his
<PB N="108" REF="007622_0106_102BAC3EE3A85F48">
only begotten Son, that who&s;oever believ|eth on him &s;hould not Peri&s;h, but have eternal Life.</HI></P>
<P>And CHRIST has given it as an evidence to the World, to know his Di&s;ciples, by their Love, one to another; John 13.35. <HI>By this &s;hall all Men know that ye are my Di&s;ciples, if ye love one another.</HI></P>
<P>And our &s;aid Confe&s;&s;ions tell us, Chap. 22 1. Parag. <HI>The acceptable way of Wor&s;hipping the true GOD is In&s;ti|tuted by him&s;elf, and &s;o limited by his own revealed Will, that he may not be Wor&s;hipped according to the imaginations, and devices of Men, or the &s;ugge&s;tions of Satan, under any vi&s;ible Repre&s;entati|ons, or any other way not pre&s;cribed in the holy Scriptures.</HI></P>
<P>And in the 7th, and 8th Parag. &s;peaking particularly of their fir&s;t Day SABBATH, (&s;o called) and in it's Sanctification, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in effect &s;ay, <HI>We mu&s;t Wor&s;hip GOD according to the imaginations and devices of Men, and &s;ugge&s;tions of Satan,</HI> by &s;ubjecting it un|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er the watch and power of Authority;

and this agrees with the Apo&s;tles Te&s;|timony, Rev. 13 4. <HI>And they wor&s;hip|ped the Dragon which gave power to the Bea&s;t, and they wor&s;hipped the Bea&s;t,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But as to &s;aid Sabbath, there is no command, nor example, nor name in Scripture for it; as hath been proved, and will &s;tand proved, till it is di&s;|proved.</P>

So likewi&s;e when CHRIST was mani|fe&s;ted in the Fle&s;h, GOD manife&s;ted him&s;elf in him <HI>by Signs, and Miracles,</HI> in doing <HI>merciful Deeds,</HI> in <HI>healing the Sick,</HI> and <HI>curing all manner of Di&s;ea&s;es</HI> and <HI>opening the Eyes of the Blind,</HI> and <HI>rai&s;ing the Dead,</HI> and <HI>ca&s;ting out Devils,</HI> and the like: But notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e Signs and Miracle, the <HI>Jews</HI> pre|&s;umptuou&s;ly de&s;ired of him a Sign from Heaven; he &s;aid unto them, <HI>O ye H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|pocrites, ye can di&s;cern the face of the Sky; but can ye not di&s;cern the &s;igns of the Times?</HI> Matth. 16, 1. &amp;c.

<P>Thus it appears that they had no Judgment to Judge of Signs, whether they were of GOD, or of the Devil: They had let in &s;uch a wilful Spirit of Unbelief, and hardne&s;s of Heart, and Per&s;ecution, that the Devil had gotten that Power over them, as to make them believe Lies, and oppo&s;e the

<P>The de&s;truction of their Fathers, was their not hearkening to the warnings of the Prophets; but Per&s;ecuted them, and put them to Death: And the De&s;truc|tion of the&s;e, was, their wilful rejecting the Go&s;pel Preached by CHRIST, and his Apo&s;tles, and confirmed to be the Go&s;pel of GOD, by the Sign, and Mi|racles that they Wrought: They both former, and latter, were de&s;troyed by a mighty De&s;truction, and we can think no better of their eternal E&s;tate without Repentance; the&s;e are all gone <HI>to come to Judgment, to receive according to the deeds done in the Body,</HI> and ought to be our Examples, to take Warning le&s;t we fall into the like Condemnation.</P>

<P>Friend <HI>Bolles</HI> &s;ays, The 7th Day which GOD ordained as a Sabbath, or Day of Re&s;t, was not a natural Day (for that no morning or evening is a&s;cribed to it) but an eternal Day of Re&s;t. But what &s;en&s;e would this make of other Scriptures? &s;hould we Explain them &s;o. <HI>Jonah</HI> was &s;ent to <HI>Nineveh,</HI> with this Me&s;&s;age; <HI>Yet forty Days, and Nineveh, &s;hall be overthrown.</HI> But no morning, and evening, were a&s;cribed to the Days, were they therefore forty eternal Days?&mdash;But there was no Sabbath from the Fall of Man, to the falling of Manna, <HI>Exod.</HI> 16, 23. &s;ays my An|tagoni&s;t. And why? becau&s;e no mention is made of it. No mention is made of any Daughters being born, 'till a little before the Flood, (for more than a thou&s;and Years) and therefore was there none? No mention is made that the Giants (<HI>Gen.</HI> 6, 4:) de&s;cend|ed from <HI>Adam,</HI> or any of his Po&s;terity: Were they therefore a new Generation of Men, no way related to <HI>Adam,</HI> &amp; his Po&s;terity? Many of the Commands were not &s;o much as men|tioned 'till <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s Day; did they not there|fore 'till then, belong to the Decalogue, or moral Law? But is it not evident enough, that the Law of the Sabbath was publi&s;h'd, &amp; obligatory, long before <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s Time, e|ven
<PB N="10" REF="007622_0136_102BAC5F1596F658">
from the beginning? For that part of the original In&s;titution, is brought down into the &s;econd Publication of it in <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s Day; and that even word, for word. And 'tis plain beyond all rea&s;onable Di&s;pute (as publi&s;h'd by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> at the falling of Manna, and as it &s;tands in the moral Law) it is not con&s;ider|ed as a new Command; but as old as the Creation. Tho'it had been much abu&s;ed, &amp; profaned, by an abandon'd wicked World; and even much, and long violated by GOD'S own profe&s;&s;ing People: Therefore we find <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;peaking of it, as what was already publi&s;hed, and known, Exod. 16.23. <HI>This</HI> (&s;ays he) is <HI>what the Lord hath &s;aid,</HI> (not what He doth now Command,) <HI>To-morrow is,</HI> (not to morrow &s;hall be) <HI>the re&s;t of the Sabbath:</HI> Therefore we find the Complaint made in the 23th ver. of the &s;ame Chapter; <HI>How long?</HI> mark the Words! how long?

who con&s;iders, That the Command to keep the Sabbath, is one of the Ten Commands of the Decalogue; and is of a moral, as well as po&s;itive Nature; and as to its moral Nature, is univer&s;ally, and perpetually Binding. To &s;pend a part of our Time to wor&s;hip, &amp; &s;erve GOD publickly, is of univer&s;al, and perpetual Obligation; and this mu&s;t re&s;pect <HI>Adam,</HI> &amp; his Po&s;terity, yea, all his Po&s;terity, one as well as another.

holy the Sabbath, which they had long, &amp; no|toriou&s;ly neglected &amp; profaned, which was a &s;ign, &amp; evidence they were Unholy, &amp; Abomi|nable in the Sight of GOD; while <HI>Jews,</HI> &amp; pro|&s;elyted <HI>Gentiles,</HI> who were faithful in &s;anctify|ing the Sabbath, carried with them, one very con&s;iderable Sign, and vi&s;ible Evidence that they were an Holy People, &amp; Con&s;ecrated to an Holy GOD; and not de&s;ecrated to pro|fane, and abominable Idol-gods.</P>

<P>I an&s;wer, There is a Chri&s;tian &s;abbath-Day, as di&s;tingui&s;h't from the Days of the Week in common: And that this Day is the fir&s;t-Day of the Week; which may be evidenc'd divers Ways.</P>
<P N="1">[1] Agreable to the fourth Command, which is of a moral, as well as po&s;itive Na|ture; and according to the morality of the fourth Command, a certain part, and pro|portion of our Time, is due to divine, and public Wor&s;hip, <HI>viz.</HI> in ordinary, &amp; common he &s;eventh part of Time; and which ac|cordingly was originally enjoyn'd by a po|&s;itive Command, to be the &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">enth Day; and which was again renewed, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">forced, in <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s Day.

if otherwi&s;e the fourth Command mu&s;t be thrown out of the Decalogue) That all Days are not like a Sabbath; but that a &s;eventh part of Time is a Sabbath; and that accordingly, the &s;eventh Day was &s;et apart by a po&s;itive Command; and &s;o continued till the Go&s;pel commenced.</P>
<P N="2">[2] That the fir&s;t Day of the Week, is the Chri&s;tian Sabbath: I argue from the appel|lation, or name of Fir&s;t-Day-Sabbath, that is &s;undry Times given to it, in the New Te&s;ta|ment; <HI>Mat.</HI> 28.1.

<P>I meddle not with that of the <HI>Savoy,</HI> nor that at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> but what they them&s;elves agreed upon, and ordered to be Printed in the Year, 1680. See my Book Pag. 20. 21. and the Quakers Suf|ferings began twenty four Years before. See my Book, Pag. 88. 89.</P>

<P>An&s;wer,</P>
<P>The&s;e are words of his own Framing, and not as I have Spoken. And then he &s;aith, <Q><HI>I have &s;aid contrary to the expre&s;s Words of our Saviour,</HI> Mark 2.27. <HI>The Sabbath was made for Man, &amp;c.</HI></Q> But as I have Written, I do not contradict our Saviour at all: For I allow all that is written in the Bible about the Re&s;t, or Sabbath, to be for Man, and for Man's Teaching; and I have no where &s;aid as he has charged me. All which the Rea|der may ob&s;erve in reading over what I have Written, beginning at my 30th Pag. He ought to &s;ay, the words exact as they are &s;poken.</P>
<P>He argues much for a Sabbath between <HI>Adam,</HI> and <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> yet he has not &s;hewn one place of Scripture that forbad La|bour, nor one place of Scripture where any per&s;on was blamed for Prophaning the Sabbath in all that time; and not|with&s;tanding he has found neither Law nor Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion about the Sabbath until <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> yet in his tenth Page, he complains,
<PB N="15" REF="007622_0171_102BACBA43DD78B0">
<Q>It had been <HI>much abu&s;ed, and prophaned by an abandoned wicked World, and even much and long Violated by God's own profe&s;&s;ing People.</HI></Q> And much more he &s;aith to the &s;ame Effect.</P>
<P>Now whether we ought to join with him to Judge and Blame the World, and God's People al&s;o, &s;ince God who is the righteous Judge, has not Blamed them at all for pro|phaning a Sabbath, in all them Thou&s;ands of Years, I leave this to the Judgment of all Mankind.</P>
<P>Concerning the Sabbath I have written in full, by Quoting Scriptures both out of the Old Te&s;tament and New, as the Reader may &s;ee, beginning at my Book, pag. 30. But now I &s;ay in &s;hort, There is no Com|mand for the Keeping the Fir&s;t Day of the Week as a Sabbath, neither in the Old Te&s;tament, nor in the New: And all that &s;aid <HI>John&s;on</HI> hath &s;aid by way of Que&s;tion, and An&s;wer, and Argument, Tradition, Rea&s;on, Revelation, and his pretended O|riginal. And if he had &s;aid an Hundred Times as much, it would not balance a Command. See Rom. 4.15. <HI>Where no Law is there is no Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion,</HI> Chap. 5. 13. <HI>Sin is not imputed when there is no Law.</HI> And &s;ays the Confe&s;&s;ion, (which he &s;ays, pag. 7, <Q><HI>Perhaps a better they could not</HI>

<P>And as to his pretended Original, &s;hall we lay a&s;ide the Bible as it is Tran&s;lated into our own Tongue, by &s;o many Tran&s;la|tors, and &s;o often Revi&s;ed? Read the Ti|tle, <HI>The Holy Bible, containing the Old Te&s;tament, and the New, Newly Tran&s;lated cut of the Original Tongues, and with the former Tran&s;lations, diligently Compared and Revi&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>And we have God's Te&s;timony to the Truth of it, who both &s;peaks Comfort and Reproof to us by it, as it is now in our Tongue; according to our inward Temp|tations and Exerci&s;es of Mind, of which I am a Witne&s;s; and no doubt Thou|&s;ands be&s;ides. Shall we, I &s;ay, &s;et all this at Nought, and that which has been counted &s;o great a Privilege, as to have the Scriptures in our own Tongue, and now to take for Truth what one Man tells us is the Meaning of this or the other Scripture in the Original, other ways than it is Tran&s;lated in our Tongue? Shall we,

I &s;ay, believe one Man again&s;t all the Tran&s;lators of the Bible?

<P>By the&s;e Two Texts cited, compared with Mat. 23.22. <HI>And he that &s;hall Swear by Heaven, Sweareth by the Throne of God, and by Him that Sitteth thereon.</HI> I &s;ay, it evidently appears we are Forbidden to Swear by the Living and True GOD.</P>
<P>After this he goes on to prove the Lawfulne&s;s of an Oath; but I think the&s;e Scriptures cited, with what is &s;aid already, is &s;ufficient to convince tho&s;e that are wil|ling to &s;ee; and they that are not, it doth not lie in the multitude of Words to help them.</P>
<P>Concerning Bapti&s;m,</P>
<P>We have no Command, nor Example throughout the New-Te&s;tament, for Bap|ti&s;ing by pouring, or &s;prinkling Water upon the Per&s;on, nor for Bapti&s;ing Infants of believing Parents, though &s;aid <HI>John&s;on <Q>&s;ays much for it by way of Argument and Rea&s;oning, and pleads for it in the room of Circumci&s;ion.</Q></HI> Yet all that he hath &s;aid makes no Proof; but let the Reader Read what I have Writ|ten, together with his An&s;wer, and Judge as he plea&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="007622_0175_102BACBC45E9CB40">
In pag. 26, &s;aid <HI>John&s;on</HI> &s;ays, <Q>Where in all the Scripture do we find the Cog|nizance, or Notice of the civil Ruler Limited, or Re&s;trained to things Tem|poral only?</Q></P>
<P>An&s;wer,</P>
<P>We Read, Gen. 49.10. <HI>The Scepter &s;hall not depart from Judah, nor a Law|giver from between his Feet until Shiloh come, and unto him &s;hall the gathering of the People be;</HI> and whereas 'tis &s;aid, <HI>The Scepter &s;hall not depart from Judah, &amp;c.</HI> That is, the typical Kingdom, and Laws &s;hould be given to them to Rule by, and to continue 'till CHRIST's Coming.

<P>So it appears there was no Power giv|en to other Kings to Rule in matters of Religion before CHRIST came; but only to them Kings, and Prie&s;ts which

as it is plain, they have been greater Sinners, in that re&s;pect, than mo&s;t, yea, than any called Prote&s;tants, that I know of.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Let them look upon all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations round about them, and &s;ee if they can find any Compare, as to Per&s;ecution, or the Judgments that have followed; I &s;ay, that <HI>New-England,</HI> above all others, &s;hould be a Land of Judgment, and not of Mercy, mu&s;t needs Argue, that there is a Cau&s;e for it, more than Ordinary.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I doubt not, but mo&s;t other Coun|tries are Guilty of other Sins, as well as Them, (Except Hypocris;ie and Per&s;ecution to that Degree as they are) and yet they have not been puni&s;hed in &s;o Eminent a Manner as <HI>New-England;</HI> which &s;hews that Per|s;ecution is a Capital Sin; and that tho'
