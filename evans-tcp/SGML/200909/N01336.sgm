<P>THE Apo&s;tle having advi|&s;ed the Colo&s;&s;ians to put off the old man with his deeds, and to put on the new man, <HI>v.</HI> 9, 10. He exhorts them to put <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, as the Elect of God, bowels of mercies, kindne&s;s, humblene&s;s of mind, meek|ne&s;s, long-&s;uffering; forbearing one another; and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel again&s;t any. He that hath put on the New man, ought to put on the &s;ingular member,
<PB N="2" REF="001587_0004_0FB3DCC15EDFFDE0">of the New-man, and to be Cloath|ed with the Properties of it; but the&s;e Vertues are (as it were) the Members and Properties of the New man; and therefore you who have put on the New man, ought to ex|erci&s;e and improve the&s;e Properties and Excellencies of the New-man. In this Ver&s;e in which our Text is, the Apo&s;tle doth &s;hew the U&s;e, and requires the Practice of the fore|mentioned Vertues, <HI>viz.</HI> Bowels of Mercies, Kindne&s;s, Humblene&s;s of Mind, Meekne&s;s, Long-&s;uffering: For what &s;ignifies it to have Vertues, and to neglect to Exerci&s;e them?

<PB N="3" REF="001587_0005_0FB3DCC2A1620540">Motive of the&s;e our Actions, <HI>viz,</HI> Chri&s;t's Example; even as <HI>Chri&s;t, forgave you, &s;o al&s;o do ye.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Two requi&s;ite Actions: The One is, <HI>Forbearing one another;</HI> this is the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> act of the fore mentioned Vertues: Now he is &s;aid to forbear another, who being hurt by another, either in words or deeds, doth not forthwith &s;eek to revenge him&s;elf, or right him&s;elf; but endeavours in a &s;pirit of lenity, love and tender|ne&s;s, to reduce the Offender to a right temper and di&s;po&s;ition of Soul; and this is the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian and Noble way of overcoming Injuries; for in this way the true Chri&s;tian overcomes and conquers him&s;elf. Prov. 16.32. <HI>He that is &s;low to anger, is better than the mighty; and he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that ruleth his Spirit, then he that taketh a City.</HI> Yea, in this way the true Chri&s;tian overcomes the malice of his Adver&s;ary.

<PB N="4" REF="001587_0006_0FB3DCC417592C40">18. Yea, in this way the true Chri|&s;tian doth not only overcome, but he overcomes in the mo&s;t legitimate way: He takes the method that God hath directed him to. Prov. 24.29. <HI>Say not, I will do to him as he hath done to me: I will render to the man according to his work.</HI> Rom. 12.17. <HI>Recompence to no man evil for evil.</HI> v. 21. <HI>Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.</HI></P>
<P><HI>[And forgiving one another]</HI> In this Action there is more contained than in the former: For there are &s;ome who &s;ometimes tolerate Injuries, becau&s;e they can't revenge them, or becau&s;e they judge it not expedient: Yet Malice boils in their hearts, and a di&s;po&s;ition of revenge: Now this the Apo&s;tle would have true Chri&s;ti|ans guard again&s;t, according to Chri&s;t's Precept. Mat. 18.35. We mu&s;t <HI>from our hearts forgive our bro|ther his tre&s;pa&s;&s;es.</HI> Luk. 6.27, 28. <HI>Love ye your Enemies, do good to them that hate you, ble&s;s them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> cur&s;e you,

<P N="1">I. PROP. <HI>CHRIST who is God and Man forgives true Chri&s;tians their Sins and Offences.</HI> This is Expre&s;s'd in our Text. Now forgivene&s;s is an act of free Grace, whereby our offended <HI>God</HI> freely, and without any Merit of ours, remits the Sin, the Guilt, and Puni&s;hment. The Per&s;on offended is he only that can forgive: Mark 2.7. <HI>Who can forgive Sins but GOD only.</HI> And forgivene&s;s is an act of mo&s;t free Mercy; and there's nothing of Me|rit in the Per&s;on forgiven.

<PB N="8" REF="001587_0010_0FB3DCCA17765900">a mi&s;ery wilfully contracted by our &s;elves; and not only &s;o, but is &s;till a Sinning-Mi&s;ery; a Mi&s;ery accom|panied with &s;tupidity, and &s;en&s;ele&s;s|ne&s;s, with Aver&s;ion from, and Oppo|&s;ition again&s;t GOD, and that very <HI>Mercy,</HI> that &s;hould deliver us. GOD commends the freene&s;s and fulne&s;s of his Goodne&s;s to us, by taking the <HI>Sea&s;on</HI> to be Merciful, when our con|dition is mo&s;t Mi&s;erable, not becau&s;e our Mi&s;ery de&s;erves His Pity. Ezek. 16.6. <HI>I &s;aid unto thee when thou wa&s;t in thy blood, live: Yea, I &s;aid unto thee, when thou wa&s;t in thy blood, Live.</HI> This forgivene&s;s is thus brought about: Man, that was infinitely bound to love and obey the Author of his Be|ing, mo&s;t ungratefully and unnece&s;|&s;arily Sinned again&s;t Him, and there|by de&s;ervedly incurred the everla&s;t|ing Cur&s;e of the mo&s;t Ju&s;t and True GOD, and forfeited his own Being: Yet, tho' Man had de&s;troyed him&s;elf, this Compa&s;&s;ionate GOD, of his own free Sovereign Will, and without any
<PB N="9" REF="001587_0011_0FB3DCCB9D7006A8">Motive, and by his own Infinite Wi&s;|dom, contrived a Way, whereby his mo&s;t exact Truth &amp; Ju&s;tice might be &s;atisfyed, and yet his Creature &s;aved, and his Mercy and Goodne&s;s there|by might be evidenced unto Men and Angels: By an Everla&s;ting Covenant between the FATHER and the SON, the SON He mu&s;t a&s;|&s;ume our Nature, and offer up One Great Sacrifice for Sin, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.12.

The Meritori|ous Cau&s;e of forgivene&s;s is that Sacri|fice of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> whereby Pardon is im|petrated for as many as lay hold upon Him by Faith. The acts which that Eternal Coun&s;el appointed to be the Means of the actual receiving of the Pardon thus offered are Prayer and Faith, <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.12. Faith in Chri&s;t is
<PB N="11" REF="001587_0013_0FB3DCCE98E5FA48">appointed to be the In&s;trument of an Actual or Effectual Application of forgivene&s;s; and this faith is the gift of <HI>God, Joh</HI> 6.44. <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.8.

1. <HI>Conclu&s;ion.</HI> The Con&s;ideration of this &s;hould have the force of an Argument to per&s;wade true Chri&s;ti|ans to forgive others. If CHRIST hath forgiven them, then they &s;hould forgive tho&s;e that have offended them; becau&s;e the Members mu&s;t be Con|formed to their Head: for it is very incon&s;i&s;tent to have a Proud and Wrathful Member under a humble Head crowned with Thornes and Pa|tience. Hence the Example of Chri&s;t is urged by Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles chiefly in tho&s;e things which belong to Charity and Humility. <HI>If I have wa&s;hed your feet, you ought to wa&s;h one a|nothers feet, for I have given you an Ex|ample,</HI> Joh. 13.14, 15, 16, 17.1 Pet. 2.21. <HI>Chri&s;t al&s;o &s;uffered for us, leaving us an Example, that we &s;hould follow his &s;teps,</HI> V. 22, 23. <HI>Who when he was reviled, re|viled not again: when he &s;uffered, be threatened not; but committed Him&s;elf to Him that judgeth righteou&s;ly.</HI> 1 Joh. 2.6. <HI>He that &s;aith he abideth in Chri&s;t, ought him&s;elf al&s;o &s;o to walk, even as

<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="conclusion">
<P N="2">2. <HI>Conclu&s;ion.</HI> The Con&s;ideration of this &s;hould have the force of a Rule to Direct true Chri&s;tians to forgive others. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Example hath the force of a Rule in directing the true Chri&s;tian in his Spiritual Life, as it contains a perfect Idea of Virtue. Hence &s;aid <HI>Bernard,</HI> What have you to do with Virtues, who are Ignorant of the Vertues of CHRIST? Where I pray you is true Prudence, unle&s;s in the Doctrine of CHRIST? Where is true Temperance, unle&s;s in the Life of CHRIST? Where is true Forti|tude, unle&s;s in the Pa&s;&s;ion of CHRIST? But let us &s;hew this in acts of forbearing and forgiving: In Chri&s;t's acts we have a mo&s;t perfect rule of Imitation, whether we behold
<PB N="15" REF="001587_0017_0FB3DCD49711F5C8">what <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> did bear and forgive, or from whom, or la&s;tly in what man|ner <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> did forbear and forgive.</P>
<P N="1">1. In Chri&s;t's Example of forbea|rance and forgivene&s;s we have a mo&s;t perfect rule of Imitation, if we con&s;i|der <HI>What</HI> CHRIST did bear and for|give. CHRIST was treated with mo&s;t bitter and heavy Revilings; He was called a Glutton, and Wine-bib|ber, a friend of Publicans &amp; Sinners, <HI>Mat.</HI> 11.19. <HI>Joh.</HI> 7.20. <HI>Luk.</HI> 11.18. They called him a Devil a Mad-man, a Bla&s;phemer, an Impo&s;tor, and what not? Nay, they did not only treat him with ill Words, but with ill Deeds; they did &s;pit upon him, they crowned him with thornes, they beat him with many &s;tripes cruelly, they crucifyed him: Yet the&s;e &s;o many and &s;o great Injuries he bore Patiently and for|gave them. Luk. 23.34. <HI>Then &s;aid Je&s;us, Father forgive them; for they know not what they do.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. In Chri&s;t's Example of forbearance &amp; forgivene&s;s, we have a mo&s;t perfect

<P N="3">3. In Chri&s;t's Example of forbea|rance and forgivene&s;s, we have a mo&s;t perfect rule of Imitation, if we con&s;ider the Manner of his forbea|rance and forgivene&s;s.

<P N="1">1. What an Evidence is and the &s;orts of them?</P>
<P N="2">2. What this &s;incere love to Chri&s;t is, that is an Evidence of forgive|ne&s;s?</P>
<P N="3">3. Whereby it will appear, That
<PB N="24" REF="001587_0026_0FB3DCE21CDF1918">this love is an infallible Evidence of this forgivene&s;s?</P>
<P N="4">4. Whence it is that this love is &s;uch an Infallible Evidence of for|givene&s;s?</P>
<P>Que&s;t. 1. <HI>What an Evidence of for|givene&s;s is? An&s;w.</HI> An Evidence of forgivene&s;s is &s;omething that is fit to make it known to, and convince the judgment of it, That &s;uch an one's Sins are forgiven; unto whom it was a &s;ecret before, &amp; a doubt or que&s;tion. As here, Her love to Chri&s;t was fit to prove her forgivene&s;s by Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Now for the &s;orts of Evidences. Evidences are either Probable or Ne|ce&s;&s;ary and Infallible.</P>
<P N="1">1. A Probable Evidence draws an A&s;&s;ent of the Under&s;tanding unto it, only as an Opinion that &s;uch an One's Sins are forgiven, which is therefore call'd the judgment of Cha|rity, if it concerneth others, as di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from the judgment of Cer|tainty; Now there are Arguments that bind us to this judgment of Cha|rity
<PB N="25" REF="001587_0027_0FB3DCE39A4C5490">that anothers Sins are forgiven: As Profe&s;&s;ion of the true faith, and a Subjection to the order of the Go&s;pel, when there is nothing again&s;t it in the Life; the&s;e are outward acts which ordinarily proceed from gracious Ha|bits; and yet do not nece&s;&s;arily con|clude Saving Grace and the forgive|ne&s;s of Sin, becau&s;e they are Argu|ments only probable, they do only infallibly Evidence common Grace, not &s;aving Grace: A vi&s;ible Saint in certainty, is a real Saint in charity, not always in certainty; many of which fell away in the days of the A|po&s;tles, and do al&s;o in the&s;e our days.</P>
<P N="2">2. A nece&s;&s;ary or infallible Evi|dence, is when there is a nece&s;&s;ary connection between the forgivene&s;s of Sin, and that which doth argue it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;o that the one cannot be without the other. And of the&s;e infallible Evi|dences there are two &s;orts.</P>
<P>(1.) That which is inherent in the Pardoned Sinner, and that is, a graci|ous qualification wrought in the heart,
<PB N="26" REF="001587_0028_0FB3DCE517FF0548">which brings forth fruit in the Life: which the Apo&s;tle calls <HI>&s;omething ac|companying Salvation;</HI> &s;uch is <HI>Love, Heb.</HI> 6.9, 10.</P>
<P>(2.) That which is Adherent, and con&s;equent, and that is a Divine Te&s;ti|mony. Thus Chri&s;t Te&s;tifies &amp; &s;aith, <HI>Her Sins which are many are forgiven;</HI> &s;o Mat 9.3. <HI>Son, be of good chear, thy Sins are forgiven thee:</HI> Both the&s;e are infallible Evidences, and the Witne&s;s of the SPIRIT is never without the Evidence of &s;ome &s;aving work in the heart, but always follows it in order of Nature.</P>
<P>Qu. 2. <HI>The Nature of Sincere Love, what it is?</HI> I &s;hall lay it down in the&s;e five Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Object of this Sincere love which infallibly evidences forgive|ne&s;s, is <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> con&s;idered in the Excel|lency of his Per&s;on, and of his Rela|tion, and of his Office, and Work. <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is the &s;pecial Object of this Evidencing love, He lyes next the Soul in this love; And it is the Ex|cellency
<PB N="27" REF="001587_0029_0FB3DCE699D4D6B8">of his Per&s;on, that draws forth this love of the Soul to <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> he &s;ee's <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> altogether lovely, <HI>Cant.</HI> 5.10. &mdash; 16. He beholds all created and increated Excellency in <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> Yea, the Excellency of Chri&s;ts Relation, and of his Office where-with he is inve&s;ted, as per&s;onally united to our Nature, and call'd of <HI>God,</HI> to be the great high Prie&s;t of our Profe&s;&s;ion, and that One only Mediator between God and us, this moves the Soul to love <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.5. <HI>Heb.</HI> 5.5, 6. The Soul looks not only on <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> as able, nor only as willing, but al&s;o as obliged and ingaged by His Fathers call, and his own voluntary ingagement, to &s;ave to the utmo&s;t all that come unto <HI>God</HI> by <HI>Him, Heb.</HI> 7.25. And the Ex|cellency of Chri&s;ts work for Sinners, in his double State of Humiliation &amp; Exaltation moves him to love Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Act of this &s;incere love to <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is a deliberate free full &amp; earne&s;t choice of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> as the mo&s;t Excellent and De&s;irable One, <HI>Jo&s;h.</HI> 24.15. <HI>Deut.</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="001587_0030_0FB3DCE81ADD7CB8">30.15&mdash;20. <HI>[Plea&s;e to turn to the place.]</HI> The heart is &s;et upon getting <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> as the Principle thing, <HI>Prov.</HI> 4.7. The Soul is willing to &s;uffer the lo&s;s of all, to part with all for <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> Phil. 3 7, 8, 9.</P>
<P N="3">3. The inward Principle &amp; Spiritual virtue whence this &s;incere love flows, is the New Creature, or a gracious frame: Love is a Grace that in its frame comprehends all Graces; and therefore is a gracious frame &s;et on work by <HI>Faith,</HI> created together with it, by the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t: For love is the fulfilling of the whole Law,</HI> Rom. 13.10. Love to God, and to Man, and to God-Man, <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t.</HI> 22.37. Love, again, is the Image of God, for God is Love, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 4 7, 8. Therefore love fits and prepares the Spirit of a Chri&s;tian to the whole work of practical Chri&s;ti|anity; and therefore contains in it, a body of gracious qualifications, di&s;|po&s;ing &amp; inclining the Soul effectually to be for Chri&s;t alone, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 73.25.</P>
<P N="4">4. The End this &s;incere love aims at, and which it is carryed out after,
<PB N="29" REF="001587_0031_0FB3DCE998D53D20">is Union to, and Communion with CHRIST, and with GOD in Chri&s;t by the HOLY GHOST, and that it may glorify Chri&s;t in all the privi|ledges &amp; duties of the New Covenant.</P>
<P N="5">5. The &s;eat &amp; &s;ubject of this love, it is the whole Soul, yea the whole Man. This holy frame animates the whole man, &amp; carries it out to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and for <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> not only the <HI>Head</HI> to know him, and the <HI>Heart</HI> to make out after him, and take up its full content|ment in him, but the <HI>whole man</HI> to be his for ever, Body &amp; Soul. Hence the Spou&s;e &s;o often Expre&s;&s;eth her love thus, <HI>I am my Beloveds, and my Beloved is mine.</HI></P>

The neglect of this Church Dealing involves us in the guilt of other mens &s;ins, and of their peri&s;hing in them. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5 22. <HI>Eph.</HI> 5.7, 11. Here take a few Rules.</P>
<P>Rule 1. <HI>Church Dealing is not only a Duty of Obedience unto God, and Sub|jection unto Chri&s;t, but of Righteou&s;ne&s;s to|wards man.</HI> Hence it is &s;et down a|mong&s;t Duties which we Owe to man. Lev. 19.17. <HI>Thou &s;halt not hate thy Brother in thine heart; thou &s;halt in any wi&s;e rebuke thy Neighbour, and not &s;uffer Sin upon him.</HI> And thus it is Commanded in the Fifth Command|ment.</P>
<P>Rule 2. <HI>Though it be a Duty of Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s towards man, yet it is limited unto men &s;tanding under Church Relati|on one unto another.</HI> Becau&s;e it is a Church Duty, &amp; we owe it to all in Church Relation, both hypocritical and &s;incere; yea, we owe it to them as Church-Members; for it is a
<PB N="40" REF="001587_0042_0FB3DCFA180E8220">Church Ordinance to be managed in a Church way.</P>
<P>Rule 3. <HI>Hence it is a Duty of Church Love and Charity.</HI> It is to be perfor|med towards all with Church Love and Charity; that is, that Charity which ari&s;eth from, and is grounded upon Church Relation. 1 Pet. 2.17. <HI>Love the Brotherbood.</HI></P>
<P>Rule 4. <HI>There is a peculiar exerci&s;e of this Church Love and Charity, between tho&s;e that are truly gracious, and in that Relation each unto other, ari&s;ing from their Invi&s;ible-Church-Relation to Chri&s;t, &amp; one to another.</HI> This Church Love and Charity ought to be regu|lar; there are &s;tanding Rules of this Church Love and Charity, whereby it is to be regulated; and by tho&s;e Rules we are to judge of Repentance or Impenitency; tho&s;e Rules mu&s;t be Con&s;cienciou&s;ly ob&s;erved, &amp; up|on the right improvement of this Judgment of Church Charity, accor|ding unto the right Rules of it, de|pends much of the regular and or|derly

<P>Rule 5. <HI>We are to proceed unto and throughout the whole cour&s;e of Church Dealing, by this Church Love and Chari|ty, in the &s;incere, fervent, and religious improvement of it from fir&s;t to la&s;t.</HI> That is, we ought to exerci&s;e it with ut|mo&s;t &s;incerity, both towards God, &amp; one toward another, for God's Glo|ry, and one anothers Good and Sal|vation; and with utmo&s;t fervency, that is, of Holy Zeal of God's Glo|ry, and man's Salvation, and that with a religious re&s;pect of Duty un|to God, and one towards another. Indeed, the life and &s;pirit of Di&s;ci|pline, it is from the Exerci&s;e of this Spiritual Gracious Love and Chari|ty; becau&s;e this Spiritual Love and Charity is that &s;piritual and gracious Principle, whereby the Duty is per|formed. There is indeed need of the Exerci&s;e of Faith, Humility, Self
<PB N="42" REF="001587_0044_0FB3DCFD1DE45800">denial, Zeal, Meekne&s;s &amp; Patience, and all Grace, unto the right perfor|mance of this Duty; but Love and Charity is the mo&s;t proper Principle, which &s;ets and keeps all other Gra|ces on work; &amp; therefore we &s;hould not intermeddle in Church Deal|ing without true Chri&s;tian Love and Charity. It is true, that it is our duty to intermeddle with Church Dealing, and we cannot without great &s;in omit it; but it is as true, that we &s;hall greatly profane Holy Di&s;cipline, if we want this Love &amp; Charity. Oh then! let us take heed that we do not intermeddle with Church-Dealing, with a contrary Spirit unto Chri&s;tian Love and Cha|rity; that is, with a &s;pirit of Preju|dice, Envy, Malice, Anger, Wrath, Bitterne&s;s, or with a &s;pirit of carnal Self-love.</P>
<P>Rule 6. and la&s;t. <HI>This true Chri&s;tian Love and Charity, will move and di&s;po&s;e tho&s;e in whom it is, to De&s;ire to forgive Others, as Chri&s;t hath forgiven them.</HI> It
