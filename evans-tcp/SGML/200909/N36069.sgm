<HEAD>On which the period of his fate, and the day of ex|ecution took place and was as follows:</HEAD>
<P>At &s;ix o'clock in the morning he took his leave of the queen and the royal family, and was with them for &s;ome time, the parting was af|fecting to the la&s;t degree; the di&s;tre&s;s of the Queen pa&s;&s;ed all de&s;cription. He left the Temple agreeable to in&s;tructors from the provincial council, at eight o'clock, at which time the mournful proce&s;&s;ion &s;et out from the Temple. The royal victim &s;at in the mayor's carriage with his confe&s;&s;or by his &s;ide praying very fervently, and two captains of the nation|onal light hor&s;e on the front &s;eat. The car|riage was drawn by two black hor&s;es, preceed|ed by the Mayor, General Santerre, and other municipal officers. One &s;quadron of hor&s;e, with trumpeters and kettle drums led this me|lancholy convoy, three heavy pieces of ord|nance, with proper implements and canoneers, with lighted matches, went before the vehicle, which was e&s;corted on both &s;ides by a treble row of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="047100_0009_10224E5F8FAF1360">
The train moved on with a &s;low pace from the Temple to the <HI>Boulevards,</HI> which was planned with cannon, and be&s;et with national guards, drums beating, trumpets &s;ounding, and colours flying. The <HI>Guillotine</HI> was erected in the middle of the &s;quare, directly facing the gate of the garden of <HI>Thuileries,</HI> between the pede&s;tal on which the grand-father of Louis was &s;tand|ing before the 10th of Augu&s;t, and the avenues which lead to the groves, called the <HI>Ely&s;ion Fields.</HI> The trotting and neighing of hor&s;es, the firrill found of the trumpets, and the conti|nual beating of drums pierced the cars of every beholder and heightened the terrors of the aw|ful &s;cene.</P>
<P>The &s;caffold was high and con&s;picuous, the hou&s;es &s;urrounding the place of execution were full of women, who looked through the win|dows. The very &s;lates which covered the roofs of the hou&s;es were rai&s;ed for the curious and intere&s;ted to look through.</P>
<P>The king alighted from the carriage at twenty minutes pa&s;t ten, and a&s;cended the &s;teps of the &s;caffold with heroic a&s;&s;urance, and every feature of his maje&s;tic countenance be &s;poke the calm &s;erenity of con&s;cious innocence, and the heroic fortitude of a chri&s;tan. His hair was dre&s;&s;ed in curls, his beard &s;haved; he wore
<PB N="8" REF="047100_0010_10224DBB32DF0688">
clean &s;hirt and &s;tock, a white wai&s;tcoat, black florentine &s;ilk breeches, black &s;ilk &s;tockings, and his &s;hoes were tied with black &s;ilk &s;trings.</P>
<P>Having then taken leave of his confe&s;&s;or who &s;hed a thou&s;and tears, he beckoned with his hand to he heard; the noi&s;e of the warlike in&s;truments cea&s;ed for a moment; but &s;oon af|ter a thou&s;and voices vociferated, with a de|te&s;table ferocity, "<HI>No &s;peeches! No har|rangues!';</HI> The unfortunate monarch wrung his hands&mdash;lifted up towards heaven&mdash;and with agony in his eyes and ge&s;ture, exclaimed, di&s;|tinctly enough to be heard by tho&s;e per&s;ons who were next to the &s;eatfold, <HI>"To thee O God, do I commend my &s;oul! I forgive my enemies! I die innocent."</HI></P>
<P>He was then &s;eized by the executioner dre&s;&s;ed in black, and they immediately tied a plank of about eighteen inches broad, and an inch thick, to his body as he &s;tood upright, &s;u&s;tening it about his arms, belly and legs; this plank was about four feet long, and came al|mo&s;t up to his chin. The executioner directly laid him upon his belly on the bench and lifted up the upper part of the board which was to receive his neck, adju&s;ted to his head properly, then &s;hut the board and pulled the &s;tring, which
<PB N="9" REF="047100_0011_10224E61C199BAA0">
is fa&s;tened to the peg at the top of the machine, which lifted up a latch, and down came the axe; [See the annexed plate.] the head was cut off in a moment, are fell into a ba&s;ket which was ready to receive it; the executioner took it up by the hair, to &s;hew the populace, and then put it into another ba&s;ket along with the body.&mdash;The final part of his execution was exactly twenty-two minutes pa&s;t ten.</P>
<P>After his head was cut off, the <HI>Sans Cullottes</HI> and <HI>Jacobins</HI> waved their hats in the air; exclaim|ing, <HI>vive la nation vive la republique!</HI> The mu&s;ic &s;truck up <HI>caira,</HI> and the body was immediately removed in a black coffin.&mdash;The proce&s;&s;ion re|turned to the Temple in full gallop, and the &s;worn deputies went to make their report.</P>
<P>Louis made a will, in which he a&s;ked pardon of God, for having &s;anctioned the decree upon the civil con&s;titution of the clergy, although this &s;anction was extorted by violence; and was contrary to his &s;olemn prote&s;t.</P>
<P>In this te&s;tament, Louis acknowledges his having freely accepted all the other parts of the con&s;titution; and having neglected nothing to remove from his dominions the &s;courge of war, and prevent the inva&s;ion of the Pru&s;&s;ians.</P>
<P>In a previous decree made by the national convention, the place for putting their inhuman
<PB N="10" REF="047100_0012_10224DBF91BFEA30">
&s;entence into executition was to have been the Carou&s;el, fronting the palace of the Thuille|ries. This was changed by the mini&s;ters, to whom all the arrangements were con&s;ided, to the place de la Revolution, heretofore the place Louis XV.</P>
<P>This city ye&s;terday re&s;embled an immen&s;e camp; the &s;ections and federates were march|ing through the different di&s;tricts;&mdash;they had their watch word; they wheeled round where one corps met the other. They carried with them upwards of 150 pieces of heavy ar|tilery, and it made a mo&s;t impo&s;ing &s;pectacle. They were con&s;tantly in motion, and could not &s;tand &s;till five minutes.</P>
<P>During the exhibition of this horrid &s;cene, all Paris was in con&s;ternation.</P>
<P>The commi&s;&s;aries of the Temple found in the king's de&s;k &s;ome gold coin, to the amount of about 3000 livres. It was done up in rou|lers, and on then was written, "to M. Mala|&s;herbes. This grateful beque&s;t of the de|dea&s;ed monarch was not complied with&mdash;the money was depo&s;ited in the &s;ecretary's office.</P>
<P>Louis &s;aw his la&s;t moment approaching with coolne&s;s and tranquility. It is long &s;ince he re&s;olved to &s;acrifice life if we may judge from the two following anecdotes.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="047100_0013_10224E6415E8F688">
Two years ago, M. de Laincourt repre&s;ent|ing to Louis, that the modifications and the <HI>veto</HI> which he oppo&s;ed to certain decrees, might be dangerous&mdash;"What can they do? replied Louis, "They will put you to death&mdash;well, I &s;hall obtain an immortal for a mortal crown."</P>
<P>The other anecdote is more recent, and proves like the former, that Louis never fear|ed death,&mdash;On the day that De&s;eze made his defence in the convention, Mala&s;herbes, in a conver&s;ation which he had with Louis in the e|vening wi&s;hed to prepare him for the event by hinting that his defence might not be attended with the de&s;ired effect, and that the i&s;&s;ue was uncertain." "I under&s;tand, you" replied Louis, "but my re&s;olution is already taken. I &s;ee without fear my la&s;t hour approaching; and I &s;hall lay my head on the block without unea|&s;ine&s;s. You will perhaps be &s;urpri&s;ed when I tell you that my wife and my &s;i&s;ter think exactly as I do."</P>
<P>The la&s;t reque&s;ts of the unfortunate Louis breathe his &s;oul of magnanimity, and a mind enlightened with the fine&s;t ideas of human vir|tue. He appears not to be that man which his enemies reported.&mdash;His heart was found, his head was clear, and he would have reigned with glory, had he but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed tho&s;e faults
<PB N="12" REF="047100_0014_10224E07CF68C360">
which his a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins laid to his charge.&mdash;His mind po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;ugge&s;tion of wi&s;dom; and even in his la&s;t moments, when the &s;pirit of life was winging for another world, his lips gave utte|rance to them, and he &s;poke with firmne&s;s and re&s;ignation.</P>
<P>Thus ended the life of Louis XVI. after a period of four years detention; during which he experienced from his &s;ubjects every &s;pecies of Ignominy and cruelty which a people could inflict on the mo&s;t &s;anguinary tyrant.&mdash;Louis the XVI. who was proclaimed at the com|mencement of his reign, <HI>the friend of the people;</HI> and by the con&s;tituent a&s;&s;embly, <HI>the re&s;torer of their liberties;</HI>&mdash;LOUIS, who but a few years &s;ince was the mo&s;t powerful monarch in Europe, has at la&s;t peri&s;hed on the &s;caffold. Neither his own natural goodne&s;s of heart&mdash;his de&s;ire to procure the happine&s;s of his &s;ubjects&mdash;nor that ancient love which the French entertained for their monarch, has not been &s;ufficient to &s;ave him from this <HI>cruel &s;acrcifie.</HI></P>
<P>&dagger;&idagger;&dagger; LOUIS the XVIth was born on the 24th of Augu&s;t, 1754, St. Bartholomew's day, otained in the annals of French hi&s;tory by the ma&s;&s;acre of the Hugonets.</P>

<P>"ANTOINE QUENTIN FOUQUIER, public accu&s;er of the criminal revoluti|onary tribunal, e&s;tabli&s;hed at Paris by a decree of the national convention of the 10th of March, 1793, &s;econd year of the republic, without any recour&s;e to the tribunal of ce&s;&s;a|tion, in virtue of the power given him by the 11th article of another decree of the conven|tion of April 5, following, &s;tating that the pub|lic

<P>"That by a decree of the convention, of the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t la&s;t, Marie Antoinette, widow of Louis Capet, has been brought before the re|volutionary tribunal, as accu&s;ed of con&s;piring again&s;t France; that by another decree of the convention, of October 3, it has been decreed, that the revolutionary tribunal &s;hould occupy it&s;elf without delay, and without interruption, on the trial; that the public accu&s;er received the papers concerning the widow Capet, on the 19th and 20th of the fir&s;t month of the &s;econd decade, commonly called the 11th and 12th of October of the pre&s;ent month; that one of the judges of the tribunal immediately proceeded to the interrogatories of the widow Capet; that an examination being made of all the pieces tran&s;mitted by the public accu&s;er, it appears that, like Me&s;&s;aline, Brunchant, Predigende, and Medicis, who were formerly qualified with the titles of queens of France, who&s;e names have ever been odious, and will never be effa|ced from the page of hi&s;tory&mdash;</P>
<P>"Marie Antoinette, widow of Louis Capet, has, &s;ince her abode in France, been the &s;courge and blood &s;ucker of the French: that

even before the happy revolution which gave the French people their &s;overeignty, &s;he had political corre&s;pondence with a man called the king of Bohemia and Hungary: that this cor|re&s;pondence was contrary to the intere&s;ts of France; and not content with acting in con|cert with the brother of Louis Capet, and the infamous and execrable Colonne, at that time mini&s;ter of the Finances; of having &s;quander|ed the finances of France (the fruit of the &s;weat of the people) in a dreadful manner, to &s;atisfy inordinate plea&s;ures, and to pay the agents of her criminal intrigues, it is notorious that &s;he has at different times tran&s;mitted milli|ons to the emperor, which &s;erved him, and &s;till &s;upports him to &s;u&s;tain a war again&s;t the repub|lic; and that it is by &s;uch exce&s;&s;ive plunder, that &s;he has at length exhau&s;ted the national trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>"That &s;ince the revolution, the widow Ca|pet has not for a moment withheld criminal intelligence and corre&s;pondence with foreign powers, and in the interior of the republic, by agents devoted to her, whom &s;he &s;ub&s;idized and cau&s;ed to be paid out of the trea&s;ury of the ci|devant civil li&s;t; that at various epochs &s;he has employed every manoeuvre that &s;he thought con&s;i&s;tent with her perfidious views to bring about a counter-revolution: fir&s;t, having under

pretext of a nece&s;&s;ary union between the ci-de|vant gardes du-corps, and the officers and &s;ol|diers of the regiment of Flanders, contrived a repa&s;t between the&s;e two corps on the fir&s;t of October, 1789, which degenerated into an ab|&s;olute orgy as the de&s;ired, and during the cour&s;e of which the agents of the widow Capet perfect|ly &s;econded her counter-revolutionary projects; brought the greater part of the gue&s;ts, in the moment of inebriety, to &s;ing &s;ongs expre&s;&s;ive of their mo&s;t entire devotion to the throne, and the mo&s;t marked aver&s;ion of the people; of having excited them in&s;en&s;ibly to wear the white cockade, and to tread the national cock|ade under foot; and of having authori&s;ed, by her pre&s;ence, all the counter-revolutionary ex|ce&s;&s;es, particularly in encouraging the women who accompanied her, to di&s;tribute the&s;e white cockades among the gue&s;ts; and having on the 4th of the &s;ame month, te&s;tified the mo&s;t immo|derate joy at what pa&s;&s;ed during the&s;e orgies.</P>
<P>'Secondly, Having in concert with Louis Ca|pet directed to be di&s;tributed very plentifully throughout the kingdom publications of a coun|ter-revolutionary nature, &s;ome of which were pretended to have been publi&s;hed by the con|&s;pirators on the other &s;ide of the Rhine (mean|ing, we &s;uppo&s;e, in Coblentz) &s;uch as&mdash;'Peti|tions to the emigrants&mdash;Reply of the emi|grants&mdash;The emigratst othe people&mdash;The &s;hor|te&s;t
