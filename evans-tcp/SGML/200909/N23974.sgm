<HEAD>An ORATION.</HEAD>
<P>MANKIND have differed in nothing more than in their religious opinions. Their creeds have been as various as their coun|tenances. Education has no &s;mall &s;hare in pro|ducing this wonderful variety. We are pa&s;&s;ive to its influence.</P>
<P>Religion, of &s;ome kind or other, has been ac|knowledged by all mankind, in all ages, and in all parts of the globe. It has been con&s;idered as the mo&s;t noble employment of the &s;oul, and pro|ductive of the mo&s;t beneficial con&s;equences to civil &s;ociety. The&s;e things have occurred, al|though mo&s;t of the religions extant owe their ex|i&s;tence more to ignorance than to argument, and are more the effects of blind credulity, than rea|&s;onable conviction. This ari&s;es from the nature of the &s;ubject. Our religion is formed before the rea&s;oning faculties are &s;ufficiently matured for examination. Principles imbibed in infancy are extremely difficult to be eradicated. They grow with our growth, they &s;trengthen with our &s;trength. Here commences the boa&s;ted empire of con&s;cience, who&s;e dictates it is thought the highe&s;t criminality to violate. There is &s;ome|thing too in the &s;ubject of religion &s;o &s;olemn and awful, that we dare &s;carcely attempt to rea&s;on our&s;elves out of pre-e&s;tabli&s;hed errors. A dread of &s;omething hereafter, the hopes of happier days, ru&s;h upon the anxious &s;oul, and di&s;arm it of its rea&s;oning power. Men in all ages have been the &s;ubjects of religious fear. Immoderate
<PB N="4" REF="031712_0003_0FEE15E995F4E538">forebodings of a world <HI>to come,</HI> have robbed the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> of half its lawful enjoyments.</P>
<P>Religion, de&s;igned to render man "mild and &s;ociable to man," has rendered him &s;elfi&s;h and implacable. Ab&s;urdities and per&s;ecutions have been the attendants of every &s;y&s;tem of religion under heaven. How often have the rights and dignity of human nature been in&s;ulted, degraded and trampled upon? How often have the honour and character of Deity been traduced, by the im|pious and ab&s;urd doctrines of religious e&s;tabli&s;h|ments? How often have mankind been deceived and led a&s;tray from truth, by &s;y&s;tems bearing on|ly the <HI>name</HI> of Divinity? How often has the &s;a|cred name of Jehovah been in&s;ulted by men act|ing under the &s;pecious appearance of &s;uperior piety? The&s;e abu&s;es, with many others commit|ted under the ma&s;k of religious hypocri&s;y, have induced &s;ome to reject all revelation, as repug|nant to rea&s;on; impo&s;ing on the ignorance and credulity of the vulgar; degrading the exalted abilities of man, and incon&s;i&s;tent with the charac|ter of Deity. They either artfully in&s;inuate, or openly declare, that the religion of a Saviour &s;tands on the &s;ame foundation with that of a Ma|homet, and the fables of antiquity. They in&s;i&s;t that ignorance and impo&s;ition are equally the &s;upporters of all. They renounce all the lumin|ous truths of revelation; they place in their &s;tead the forlorn "age of rea&s;on." They aim their wit and ridicule at the very exi&s;tence of Chri&s;|tianity, and treat with impious and ungenerous contempt that life and immortality brought to light by the go&s;pel. They rob virtue of her hope. They add in&s;ult to the misfortunes of life. They transform the beauties of Paradi&s;e into the barren wilds of non-exi&s;tence. They plant on the grave the &s;eeds of annihilation. They level man with the brute. De&s;tined, like a meteor of the night, to blaze for a moment, he vani&s;hes
<PB N="5" REF="031712_0004_0FEE15EB1F228520">forever in the &s;hades of darkne&s;s. To-day he exults in the highe&s;t glory; to-morrow he min|gles with the worm in the du&s;t.</P>
<P>Man, as a being prone to err, becomes an ob|ject of commi&s;eration. Ridicule is a breach of humanity; it is oftering violence to the feel|ings of the human heart. We will &s;hed the tear of &s;orrow over the tomb of man's departed glo|ry; but let us not deprive him of that religion which alone can alleviate the misfortunes of life.</P>
<P>While men have been pleading an univer&s;al toleration of religious opinions, we rejoiced at their &s;ucce&s;s; we &s;aw them di&s;arming per&s;ecution of her weapons; we imbibed their &s;ympathy; we warmed with their philanthropy. That elegance of &s;tyle and independency of thought which charac|terize the writings of &s;ome who have oppo&s;ed reve|lation, have in &s;ome in&s;tances captivated the pa&s;&s;ions and &s;educed the judgment. They have with great exultation vilified the character of the clergy. We are &s;en&s;ible of eccle&s;ia&s;tical abu&s;es; they cannot be too much expo&s;ed: but while we deprecate the ambition of the clergy, &s;o de&s;tructive to the peace of civil &s;ociety, when &s;trengthened by the arm of the magi&s;trate, let us not abu&s;e indi&s;crimi|nately an order of men &s;o important and u&s;eful to mankind. Society, in an improved &s;tate, cannot exi&s;t without them. Though they form the mind and mend the heart, yet &s;ome, either from ignorance or envy, have repre&s;ented them as unfriendly to the improvements of the human mind&mdash;to the lights and progre&s;s of philo&s;ophy. We feel our&s;elves peculi|arly plea&s;ed and honoured in appealing to the pre|&s;ent occa&s;ion, as a full refutation of their illiberal a&s;per&s;ions. Tho&s;e venerable Worthies, who&s;e pre|fence gives dignity and re&s;pect to the ceremonies of this day; who&s;e benevolence is at this moment li&s;tening to the feeble efforts of the &s;peaker, ri&s;e &s;u|perior to the in&s;inuations of malice, and &s;ufficient|ly evince their attachment to &s;cience and virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="031712_0005_0FEE15C5681CC0C8">
But what have the &s;y&s;tems and errors of men to do with the religion of heaven? We renounce all &s;y&s;tems but the &s;y&s;tem of God. Men, in &s;upport|ing their favourite opinions, have undoubtedly been led into error. This by no means derogates from truth. While we &s;mile at the incomprehen|&s;ible commentaries of &s;y&s;tem-builders, our vene|ration for the great original is increa&s;ed. Like its divine Author, it cannot be de&s;troyed. Heav|en and earth &s;hall pa&s;s away, and nature di&s;&s;olve at the feet of Jehovah&mdash;but religion exi&s;ts for|ever.</P>
<P>As a &s;y&s;tem coming from heaven, with every mark of its divinity, it ought to influence our be|lief and actions. But, &s;ay &s;ome, the belief of the Chri&s;tian &s;criptures is no proof of their truth and importance. Becau&s;e, continue the objectors, the &s;ame proof is applicable to every &s;y&s;tem of er|ror extant. This will be granted. Things are either true or fal&s;e, independent of belief. "Man cannot create, he can only di&s;cover."</P>
<P>But the credence of fal&s;e &s;y&s;tems of religions, is no proof or argument again&s;t one which carries indelible characters of its divinity. It rather heightens its value. Virtue never more intere&s;ts the heart than when contra&s;ted with vice. To reject <HI>all</HI> truth, merely becau&s;e we are liable to err, is the height of ab&s;urdity. Man, it is true, is from his cradle expo&s;ed to deception. This by no means argues him de&s;titute of knowledge. Admit this rea&s;oning to be ju&s;t, and you not only de&s;troy the credibility of revealed religion, but you &s;trike at the root of all knowledge, and level man's boa&s;ted acquirements in the du&s;t.</P>
<P>The weakne&s;s of human rea&s;on to determine on many things in morals and religion, points out to man the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome &s;uperior guide, of &s;ome unerring &s;tandard, to which he may refer his ac|tions, and appreciate their worth. The very idea of man's moral agency involves in it the &s;uppo|&s;ition
<PB N="7" REF="031712_0006_0FEE15ECA791CA90">of laws to a&s;certain and govern his actions. From whom can tho&s;e laws originate, but the Le|gi&s;lator of the Univer&s;e? If God govern the natu|ral world by univer&s;al laws, why not the moral? The &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity is evident in both. The pro|mulgation of the&s;e laws is the revelation we plead for. The nece&s;&s;ity and importance of &s;uch a reve|lation becomes a &s;erious and all-intere&s;ting enqui|ry. It involves in it man's pre&s;ent and future happine&s;s.</P>
<P>The great end Deity had in view, in delivering to man a tran&s;cript of his mind, was to make known to him his true character; to teach him in what his real happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts; to confirm the wi&s;hes of his heart in immortality; to offer the greate&s;t incentives to virtue, the greate&s;t deter|ments from vice, by e&s;tabli&s;hing the doctrine of a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments. The in|comprehen&s;ibility of &s;ome parts of revelation has, with great force and dependence, been urged as an in&s;uperable objection to their veracity. It re|mains for tho&s;e who make the objection to prove this peculiar to revelation.</P>
<P>As well might we reject the truth of our own exi&s;tence, becau&s;e we cannot comprehend the laws of animal motion. Shall we di&s;believe the exi&s;tence of all tho&s;e magnificent &s;cenes di&s;clo&s;ed to our view throughout the works of creation, becau&s;e we cannot comprehend <HI>all</HI> the laws by which they are governed? Man, after all his won|derful di&s;coveries, will find more to admire than to comprehend&mdash;more to animate his devotion than to confirm his unbelief.</P>
<P>This, &s;o far from being an argument again&s;t the truth of revelation, is one of the greate&s;t in its favour. If man had been its author, would it not in every re&s;pect have been within the &s;phere of his comprehen&s;ion? Like all the works of man, whe|ther of genius or imitation, it might have been perfectly under&s;tood.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="031712_0007_0FEE15C19DFF8120">
In a revelation coming from heaven, we can|not expect, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of exi&s;tence, fully to comprehend all its de&s;igns. The weakne&s;s of human rea&s;on is &s;uch, as to render us totally un|qualified to &s;can the coun&s;els of the Divinity.</P>
<P>That there are many things beyond the com|prehen&s;ion of the human mind, is the experience of philo&s;ophy. The Chri&s;tian &s;criptures are not a &s;ingular ca&s;e. Omni&s;cience is an attribute of Deity only. It is &s;ufficient for man he can learn his duty, and motives powerful enough to prompt him to its performance. Revelation contains both in an eminent degree. All knowledge flows from God. The mind that can fully comprehend the anatomy of a fly, is equal to the knowledge of the univer&s;e. The power that can give animation to a mite, can with the &s;ame ea&s;e move unnum|bered worlds.</P>
<P>A&s;toni&s;hed at the wonderful di&s;coveries made in the philo&s;ophic world, &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed revelation to be &s;uperfluous. Philo&s;ophy, it is true, di&s;clo&s;es to us ten thou&s;and &s;cenes, all beautiful; all magnificent; all &s;ublime. Af|fr&s;ted by &s;cience, man has read the great volume of creation; he has triumphed over the elements; he has rendered the laws of nature obedient to his will. But however exten&s;ive man's re&s;earches may be; however he may have improved his mind or exalted his nature by the lights of rea&s;on and philo&s;ophy; yet, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the&s;e alone, all his pro&s;pects, all his expectations, terminate in uncertainty. Clouds and darkne&s;s hover over the regions of the grave. We mark man's entrance into life; we ob&s;erve the developement of his genius, in all his wonderful di&s;coveries; we fol|low him to the tomb&mdash;but, de&s;titute of the light of revelation, we lo&s;e him forever.</P>
<P>The di&s;po&s;ition of Deity towards man, in par|doning his &s;ins, and re&s;toring him to future hap|pine&s;s, can never be di&s;covered by the efforts of
<PB N="9" REF="031712_0008_0FEE15FB17B682C8">rea&s;on, however improved by philo&s;ophy, or matured by experience. The hi&s;tory of ages proves to us the uncertainty in which the light of nature and the &s;agacity of philo&s;ophy leave man, with re&s;pect to a future exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>The human mind, long before the dawn of the Chri&s;tian aera, had arrived at an a&s;toni&s;hing de|gree of refinement. Poets had reached the height of &s;ublimity, orators had harangued in all the ve|hemence of eloquence, philo&s;ophers had taught the principles of morality; but the great problem of man's immortality remained un&s;olved. It was re&s;erved for revelation to demon&s;trate the truth of man's re&s;urrection. Her energi&s;ing voice awakes the &s;lumbers of the tombs. She gives to man a new creation. She proclaims him the heir of immortal glory. Situated in the mid&s;t of gaz|ing worlds, he intere&s;ts the feelings of all that bright train which bow before the burning throne of God.</P>
<P>The pro&s;pects of man are great&mdash;his happine&s;s inviolate. Deity has di&s;tingui&s;hed him as an ob|ject of his peculiar beneficence and attention. He has &s;tamped on him the &s;eal of his divinity. His progre&s;s in &s;cience and religion proves the in|finite perfectibility of his mind. Erect in &s;tature, man &s;eems formed for contemplating all the beau|tiful and &s;ublime works of nature. Although an inhabitant of earth, his wi&s;hes reach beyond the &s;tars. The glittering portals of heaven lie wide extended for man's reception. The &s;hades of ignorance and tyrannic gloom, which have &s;o long beclouded the pro&s;pects of man, are vani&s;hing before him. Wafted on the wing of in&s;piration, we hail the period as not far di&s;tant, when the religion of peace and good-will &s;hall emancipate man, and give to the univer&s;e the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible happine&s;s.</P>

<P>IN retiring from the place of our education, gratitude demands our acknowledg|ments to the honourable Corporation.</P>
<P>If to form the mind to virtue and knowledge, is an object of the fir&s;t magnitude in a free &s;tate, what re&s;pect is due to the founders and patrons of this flouri&s;hing in&s;titution! Your benevolent exertions in the cau&s;e of &s;cience and religion, merit the eulogium of every friend of humanity, but more e&s;pecially of us, who this day receive the honours of this Univer&s;ity. To you, Gen|tlemen, are due the fir&s;t fruits of all our toils. It is to you, ye friends of &s;cience and freedom, we owe the birth of that in&s;titution which calls us her &s;ons. This renders your names and your virtues dear to our memories. Sen&s;ible of the importance and nece&s;&s;ity of a general diffu&s;ion of knowledge in a republican government; ac|tuated by the noble principles of patrioti&s;m and philanthropy, you have founded and fo&s;tered to its pre&s;ent re&s;pectability you a&s;ylum of the arts and &s;ciences.

In looking back on the pa&s;t &s;cenes of collegiate life, we behold you, Gentlemen, alluring us through the de|lightful walks of &s;cience and refinement.

<PB N="15" REF="031712_0014_0FEE15B0ABF042B0">&s;chool of cla&s;&s;ic erudition, it gives us admi&s;&s;ion on the wide theatre of the world. We become citizens of an enlightened nation. Let us carry with us into its bo&s;om tho&s;e le&s;&s;ons of patriot|i&s;m and freedom we have been taught in the &s;hades of the academic grove. Let our future lives, as citizens and as men, be worthy the place of our education. May tho&s;e who have with parental care guided the &s;teps of our youth, rejoice in our future u&s;efulne&s;s to mankind. We cannot deny them this &s;mall recompence. May our lives be ever governed by the great lights of rea&s;on and revelation. Then &s;hall we meet the&s;e our friends beyond the narrow tide of time, where &s;ighing and &s;orrow &s;hall be no more, and tears &s;hall be wiped from all faces. Ani|mated by this heart-cheering pro&s;pect, &s;et us put|in the career of unlimited improvement. The God of boundle&s;s love will never &s;uffer the won|derful acquirements of man to &s;leep in the cold bed of death. Each improvement we make in virtue, each acqui&s;ition we gain in &s;cience, will be treading the courts of immortality.</P>
<P>Although &s;eparated as we &s;oon &s;hall be by re|turning to our homes&mdash;yet by indulging a retro|&s;pective view of the &s;ciences we have &s;tudied to|gether, of the plea&s;ures we have enjoyed in each other's &s;ociety, and the friend&s;hips we have here contracted, &s;hall we not daily meet in yon retreat of the Mu&s;es, and &s;teal our&s;elves from the cares of a bu&s;y world? Yes, my Cla&s;s-Mates, the re|collection of your friend&s;hip and tenderne&s;s &s;hall often, through the varied &s;cenes of future life, excite the tear of &s;ympathy and love. Your friendly images are too deeply engraved on the tablets of my heart for time ever to era&s;e. Re|ceive, dear Brothers, my be&s;t wi&s;hes for your future happine&s;s. May the gentle breath of peace forever attend you. But why &s;hould we, in the
<PB N="16" REF="031712_0015_0FEE15BA45430008">mid&s;t of this li&s;tening and &s;ympathi&s;ing audience, recount our attachments, or renew the &s;incerity of our friend&s;hip? They are not in&s;en&s;ible of our feelings. They can witne&s;s to the reluctance of our parting.</P>
<P>But time ha&s;tens us to perform the mo&s;t plea&s;ing and affecting &s;cene of this day's anniver&s;ary.</P>
<P>To you, ye Companions of my youthful days, I now appeal for a de&s;cription of &s;en&s;ations with which my heart is agitated.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t bid you a long, perhaps to &s;ome of you &mdash;an eternal adieu!. Let not our &s;eparation weak|en or break the cords of friend&s;hip and love.</P>
<P>I have now arrived at the mo&s;t trying &s;cene my duty has ever called me to perform. The curtain of &s;eparation is fa&s;t drawing. One more moment di&s;&s;olves forever our collegiate connexion. With the &s;incerity of a friend, the love of a brother, and the benediction of heaven, I wi&s;h you all an af|fectionate FAREWELL!</P>
