<P>When we were yet without &s;trength, in due time Chri&s;t died for the ungodly, Rom. 5, 6. God com|mendeth his love towards us in that while we were yet &s;inners. Chri&s;t died for us, ver&s;e 8, who, by the grace of God, hath ta&s;ted death for every man, Heb. 2, 9; he gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for all, to be te&s;tified in due time, 1 Tim. 2, 6. He was a lamb &s;lain from the foundation of the world, Rev. 5, 8, 12, 13. In the fulne&s;s of time he appeared to put away &s;in by the &s;acrifice of him&s;elf, Heb. 9, 26, that they which live might not live unto them&s;elves, but unto him that died for them, Rom. 5, 8. He is not willing that any &s;hould peri&s;h, but that all &s;hould come to repent|ance, 2 Pet. 3, 9, and receive the go&s;pel, which is the power of God, unto &s;alvation, to them that be|lieve, Rom. 1, 16, which was preached to every crea|ture under Heaven, Col. 1, 23; and if it be hid, it is hid to them which are lo&s;t, in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, le&s;t the light of the glorious go&s;pel of Chri&s;t &s;hould &s;hine into them, 2 Cor. 4, 3, 4; for this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men love darkne&s;s rather than light, becau&s;e their deeds are evil, John 3, 19. In Chri&s;t was life, and the life was the true light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world, chap. 1, 4, 9, by which all things that are reprovable are made manife&s;t; for what&s;oever maketh manife&s;t is light, Ephe. 5, 13. This is the more &s;ure word of prophecy, whereunto we do well to take heed, as unto a light that &s;hineth in a dark place, 2 Pet. 1, 19; for God has &s;aid his &s;pirit will not always &s;trive with man, Gen. 6, 3, wherefore let us &s;ubmit our&s;elves to the word of his grace, which is able to give us an inheritance among all them which are &s;anctified, Acts, 20, 32.</P>

God is light, and in him is no darkne&s;s at all, 1 John, 1, 5; the Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father, John, 17, 21; the Holy Gho&s;t, pro|ceeding from the Father and the Son, chap. 15, 26, by which all things that are reprovable are made ma|nife&s;t; for what&s;oever maketh manife&s;t is light, Ephe. 15, 13. As many, therefore, as do &s;ubmit to the divine life, John 1, 4, which &s;hines into them by way of reproof, ver&s;e 9, and I&s;ai. 51, 1, 4, making mani|fe&s;t to them what is &s;in, John 13, 19, 20, and Ephe. 5, 13, will be led to &s;ee the evil of &s;in, and feel con|demnation for it in a higher or lower degree, behold|ing, with the eye of the mind, that damnation is the ju&s;t reward of &s;in, Rom. 6, 23.
