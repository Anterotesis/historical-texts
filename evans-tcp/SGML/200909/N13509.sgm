<HEAD>A FOURTH ESSAY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;y&s;tem of taxation equal to the public expenditures, adopted and recommended by Congre&s;s, is grounded on the mo&s;t &s;olid and demon&s;trable principles, and, if there is no error or defect in the execution of it, cannot fail of producing the two great ends expected from it, viz. Supplying the expences of the States, and reducing our currency to a fixed and permanent value. The&s;e two effects will be produced by the natural operation of this &s;y&s;tem, without any force or extraneous helps. Yet 'tis to be noted here with care and concern, that when the&s;e great and &s;teady principles come to operate on the pre&s;ent di&s;tracted &s;tate of our currency and finances, very &s;ad and perhaps fatal effects will be produced, and in|finite inju&s;tice done, even by this forcible remedy, though the mo&s;t &s;alutary and only effectual one, if &s;ome care is not taken to direct its force and limit its fir&s;t effects. The appreciation of our currency is among the fir&s;t of the&s;e ill con&s;equences which I fear, and would guard again&s;t. The evils of this I have con&s;idered in my &s;econd E&s;|&s;ay; but as what I there urged either has not been under&s;tood or regarded, I think it nece&s;&s;ary here to re&s;ume the &s;ubject, which cer|tainly merits the highe&s;t attention of every American.</P>
<P>The value of money is what it is now worth to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. The pre&s;ent exchange of continental money is to hard money at the rate of about forty to one, though it is very fluctuating; at this exchange of forty to one, which is very near the truth, and for which I appeal to the merchants and gold&s;miths books, I &s;ay, at this exchange, our debt of continental money, <HI>i. e.</HI> all the continental money in circulation, is worth five millions of dollars in hard money. For the reader need not be told that that value is found by dividing the whole &s;um of our currency, viz. two hundred millions of dollars, by the exchange, viz. forty, which will make a quotient of five millions of dollars of hard money. If this exchange is reduced, &s;ay to twenty for one, it will increa&s;e this public debt to ten millions of hard dollars. Therefore it follows, that every appreciation of the money increa&s;es the public debt, and to an amazing degree, by leaps, though almo&s;t imper|ceptible, yet certain, and to an amount almo&s;t beyond belief. For if the exchange &s;hould fall to ten for one, the debt would ri&s;e to twenty millions; an exchange of five to one would rai&s;e the debt to forty mil|lions of hard dollars, and &s;o on till the debt would ri&s;e to two hundred millions of hard dollars, and all this without the lea&s;t benefit to the
<PB N="4" REF="017064_0003_0F9FBFCB0CDCB598">
public, but in every view to its detriment. For, over and above the va&s;t increa&s;e of taxes nece&s;&s;ary to pay this increa&s;ed debt, many other evils &s;till wor&s;e than the tax would follow, to which I mu&s;t beg the reader's mo&s;t &s;erious attention: for however out of &s;ight and di&s;tant it may appear, the mi&s;chief is infinite, and mu&s;t be fatal, if not pre|vented.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. <HI>This appreciation will rai&s;e the value of the money in the che&s;ts of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, in proportion as it increa&s;es the public debt.</HI> This will rai&s;e the great money-holders into nabobs, &s;o rich there will be no living with them. They have already, it is generally thought, much more than their &s;hare. Men of overgrown riches, e&s;pecially of &s;udden acquirement, are dangerous to any community. They are not ge|nerally people of the be&s;t refinement of manners or wi&s;e&s;t di&s;cretion, and therefore their influence in the community, which will ever be <HI>(caeteris paribus)</HI> in proportion to their wealth, will be dangerous; but were they all the be&s;t of men, &s;uch amazing and &s;udden acqui&s;i|tions of wealth would be enough to &s;poil them. We find, by long and various experience, that human nature cannot bear, without corruption, &s;uch &s;udden leaps into the heights of greatne&s;s, pro&s;peri|ty, wealth and influence.</P>
<P N="2">2d. <HI>This &s;ame cau&s;e will induce all men to hoard their money,</HI> when <HI>they find it grows better and better daily in their che&s;ts.</HI> Money will &s;oon become &s;o &s;carce, as not to be obtained without great difficulty, and this will increa&s;e the value or appreciation of it; for the value of money will ever be in proportion to its &s;carcity and demand. Thus every &s;tage of this mi&s;chief will tend to increa&s;e the evil, and lead on to further &s;tages of the &s;ame calamity and di&s;tre&s;s. This is obvious to every one.</P>
<P N="3">3d. <HI>This &s;ame cau&s;e will ruin our trade and manufactures;</HI> for the ri&s;e of money in the de&s;k will be more profitable than any trade or branch of manufacture. This will ruin all indu&s;try; for the rich will not go into bu&s;ine&s;s, and the poor will not find employers, and this will produce &s;carcity of all goods, both home produced and im|ported, and of cour&s;e general di&s;tre&s;s and want mu&s;t follow.</P>
<P N="4">4th. <HI>This &s;ame appreciation will increa&s;e the public debt, and con&s;e|quently will increa&s;e the taxes by which it mu&s;t be paid, and that in pro|portion to the value or amount of the appreciation.</HI> The appreciation of money is like an account in a merchant's book; there mu&s;t be a deb|tor and creditor to it. It is not po&s;&s;ible that one &s;hilling &s;hould be gained by one per&s;on in this way, which is not lo&s;t by &s;omebody. If you make the money more valuable in my pocket, it will co&s;t the public more to redeem it; and therefore, if it was to be appreciated up to its original value, every man's tax mu&s;t be multiplied by the pre&s;ent exchange, <HI>i. e.</HI> made about forty times bigger than it need be to redeem all the money at the pre&s;ent value; and therefore it is pro|bable tho&s;e who think the pre&s;ent taxes are not more than the fortieth part of what they &s;hould be, will be zealous promoters of the &s;cheme of appreciation.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="5" REF="017064_0004_0F9FBFCB784D8B30">5th. <HI>This &s;ame thing will increa&s;e every private debt.</HI> For nothing is plainer than this, viz. if the money is more valuable at the time of payment than it was at the time of contract, the debt is thereby in|crea&s;ed, <HI>i. e.</HI> it will take more hard money or more wheat to pay the debt than would have paid it at the time of contract. This brings on the inevitable ruin of many poor people, who cannot avoid being more or le&s;s in debt for rent or &s;ome other nece&s;&s;ary thing. It is hard enough for them to pay their debts at their ju&s;t value; but when the &s;um comes to be increa&s;ed, perhaps doubled or trebled in a few months, the payment becomes either extremely difficult or impo&s;&s;ible. This might at fir&s;t plea&s;e the rich pretty well, but they would find their mi&s;take, for they would be obliged &s;oon to accept a notice of bankruptcy in&s;tead of payment from their debtors.</P>
<P N="6">6th. The great cry for appreciation is, that tho&s;e who have &s;uffered by depreciation ought to have the benefit of a compen&s;ation by the appreciation of the currency; but this is nugatory, and will prove in the end a perfect deception. <HI>For not one tenth part, perhaps not an hundredth part of the money, when it &s;hall appreciate, will be found in the hands of tho&s;e who have &s;uffered by the depreciation.</HI> It will be no adequate remedy to any of them, but will be an increa&s;e of di&s;tre&s;s and injury to far the greate&s;t part of them. Tho&s;e per&s;ons who have &s;uffered by the depreciation, but by the chance of the times have been able to make it up &s;ome other way, &s;o as to be able to hoard up &s;ufficient &s;ums of money to take advantage of the ap|preciation, tho&s;e, I &s;ay, are not the great objects of my concern; but the helple&s;s widow, the fatherle&s;s infant, and a thou&s;and others who have been obliged, through the deficiency of their intere&s;t, to &s;pend on the principal, till it is all or mo&s;tly gone, tho&s;e, I &s;ay, are the great objects of pity; their cries for ju&s;tice and compen&s;a|tion ought to be heard; the appreciation does them no good, for they have not ca&s;h on which it can operate; for nobody can take any benefit of the appreciation, but &s;uch as have more ca&s;h on hand than all their taxes will amount to; but the afore&s;aid widows, &amp;c. are by the appreciation plunged into an increa&s;ed di&s;tre&s;s and injury; for if they have an acre of land, or a hor&s;e or cow left, they mu&s;t be loaded with a va&s;t increa&s;e of taxes, in order to appreciate the money which they have lo&s;t, and which now lies hoarded in the coffers of their rich neighbours, who have gotten it from them. From this view of the matter, it appears that many peo|ple may imagine that they &s;hall receive an advantage from the ap|preciation, and therefore cry loudly for it, who will, in the end, be greatly hurt by it. It &s;eems they a&s;k they know not what, like the mother of Zebede's children, who, in the ardency of maternal affec|tion, petitioned our Saviour that her two &s;ons might &s;it, the one on his right hand, and the other on his left, not con&s;idering that the purport of her petition was, that one of her &s;ons might be &s;aved and the other damned.</P>
<P N="7">7th. The appreciation <HI>of the continental bills</HI> will continue through the <HI>whole cour&s;e of it all the mi&s;chiefs of a fluctuating currency.</HI> This
<PB N="6" REF="017064_0005_0F9FBFCC050CEC48">
de&s;troys or varies the &s;tandard or common mea&s;ure of value of all things bought or &s;old; renders all money contracts and debts un|certain; corrupts the equity and alters the force of our laws, by vary|ing the fines, forfeitures, and fees limitted by them; and in &s;hort, throws both the private man in his dealings, and the judge on the bench, into &s;uch perplexity and confu&s;ion, that neither can have due knowledge of right, even when they may be di&s;po&s;ed to do it, whil&s;t the wicked have the greate&s;t latitude in which they may practice &s;hocking wrongs, and that in the face of the &s;un, and with impunity. This &s;u&s;pends the rewards of virtue and the puni&s;hment of vice, corrupts the morals of the people, and in the end produces every evil work. Surely this picture is dreary.</P>
<P N="8">8th. <HI>From all the&s;e mi&s;chiefs no one benefit can ari&s;e to the public.</HI> Every advantage of the appreciation goes to the rich men who have got the money hoarded, and to them alone. Why then all this more than Herculian labour of appreciating the money? why all the&s;e ri&s;ks and public dangers? why all this multiplied burden and di&s;tre&s;s on our people? The u&s;es of the currency are to every purpo&s;e as great to the public if fixed at the pre&s;ent value, at 2d. or 3d. the dollar, as at any other value that can be named.</P>
<P N="9">9th. <HI>The appreciation of the currency will de&s;troy the equity of the taxation it&s;elf,</HI> according to the known and received principles of it, viz. that all e&s;tates ought to be taxed in proportion to their value, in &s;uch manner that every man's e&s;tate, after the tax is paid, &s;hall bear the &s;ame proportion to his neighbour's as before, <HI>i. e.</HI> &s;o that no man &s;hould be enriched or impoveri&s;hed by the tax more than his neigh|bour. But if the money is appreciated, the tax will have a very different effect, as will be obvious at fir&s;t &s;ight, only by viewing its operation in one very familiar in&s;tance, viz. Suppo&s;e two brothers have each a plantation of equal value, &s;ay worth one thou&s;and pounds hard money each, and one of them &s;ells his plantation for one thou|&s;and pounds hard money, and changes that money into forty thou&s;and pounds continental money, and the tax comes on; and we will further &s;uppo&s;e they are both taxed according to the value of their e&s;tates, <HI>i. e.</HI> equally, and that the tax nece&s;&s;ary to appreciate the money be twenty per cent. on the whole value; it appears then plain that the tax of the one, who keeps his plantation, will be two hundred pounds hard money, and the tax of the other, who has forty thou|&s;and pounds continental money, will be eight thou&s;and pounds of that money; con&s;equently, the fir&s;t will have a clear e&s;tate left of eight hundred pounds hard money value, but the other will have an e&s;tate worth thirty-two thou&s;and pounds hard money, for by the &s;up|po&s;ition all the money he has left will be appreciated up to its ori|ginal value, <HI>i. e.</HI> to the value of hard money, and will be worth forty times as much as his brother's e&s;tate. But if all the&s;e argu|ments do not convince, I have one more, which I think mu&s;t do for the hardie&s;t opponent; it is this&mdash;</P>
<P N="10">10th. <HI>The &s;cheme of appreciation will de&s;troy it&s;elf; it is in its nature impracticable, and its own operation will work its de&s;truction.</HI> For the
<PB N="7" REF="017064_0006_0F9FBFCCE7A6C5A8">
appreciation of the currency will increa&s;e the taxes and public bur|dens to &s;uch an enormous and in&s;upportable amount, that the people neither can, or will, or ought to bear them. When they come to be told that all their taxes are not at all for the benefit of the public, but are for no other purpo&s;e than to increa&s;e the value of the money hoarded by their rich neighbours (and they certainly will find this out) they will join in one general cry again&s;t the oppre&s;&s;ion, with one voice damn the taxes, and &s;wear they will not pay them. Then the mighty bubble will &s;ink into nothing, and with it will go all our revenue, public faith, defence, honour and political exi&s;tence. Very many things more might be added on this fertile &s;ubject; but if what I have &s;aid in my &s;econd e&s;&s;ay on this &s;ubject, and what I have repeated and added here, is not &s;ufficient for conviction, it is vain and u&s;ele&s;s in my opinion to add more, and &s;hall only here beg my readers patience and attention a moment to an affair of my own.</P>
<P>I do here, as an individual&punc; enter my prote&s;t mo&s;t &s;olemnly again&s;t this mo&s;t fatal, u&s;ele&s;s and chimerical &s;cheme of appreciating the cur|rency, and am determined to leave a copy of my E&s;&s;ays with my chil|dren, that my po&s;terity may know that in 1780 there was, at lea&s;t, one citizen of Philadelphia who was not totally di&s;tracted, and that they may have the honour and con&s;olation of being de&s;cended from a man, who was able to keep in his &s;en&s;es in times of the greate&s;t infa|tuation. But all this notwith&s;tanding, and although appearances are &s;trong again&s;t me, I will &s;till hope that there yet is a judicious majo|rity on my &s;ide, who are thoroughly &s;ick of all vi&s;ionary projects, and wi&s;h to adopt the &s;ub&s;tantial and &s;ure remedies which &s;till remain in our power. With &s;uch as the&s;e I will mo&s;t chearfully join in com|pany, and &s;it down with them with great plea&s;ure, and unite in far|ther con&s;ultation on the important &s;ubject, begging this favour at the &s;ame time of the re&s;t, who do not like our employment, that they would not come into the room to interrupt us; and this they cannot think a hard&s;hip, as they certainly can lo&s;e nothing by it, for I real|ly have not one word more to &s;ay to them.</P>
<P>If it is granted that the currency ought not to be appreciated up to its original value, <HI>I cannot &s;ee a &s;hadow of rea&s;on <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> it &s;hould be appre|ciated at all, and not be fixed at its pre&s;ent value.</HI> The truth is always better than any thing near it, although ever &s;o near. Every &s;hilling that it may be appreciated is added to the public debt, for which the public receives not the lea&s;t advantage, but all the profit goes to the great hoarders of our currency; for tho&s;e who have no more on hand than ju&s;t the amount of their whole tax get nothing by it. There remains then but two things to be con&s;idered: 1&s;t. <HI>What the pre&s;ent exchange is; and</HI> 2dly. <HI>How to fix it to that exchange or value.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t</HI> As to the fir&s;t of the&s;e there is a difficulty, principally ari&s;ing from this, viz. that the exchange is not the &s;ame in all the States, but different in the different States, and this difference is not fixed in the different States, but &s;ometimes varies in the &s;everal parts of the &s;ame State. But it is here to be ob&s;erved, that the exchange of the &s;everal parts of the State differs very little from that which prevails in
<PB N="8" REF="017064_0007_0F9FBFCE035FE058">
the great capitals neare&s;t to them, and what little variation there is, mo&s;t generally appears to lie in this, viz. that the exchange ri&s;es fir&s;t in the great capitals, and the out towns, of le&s;s trade, follow pretty quickly after them; &s;o that the exchange of each State may be pretty &s;afely taken from that of its capital, or the great capital to which it is mo&s;t contiguous. The rule by which I find the true exchange at any given time is, to take the exchange which prevailed at the given time in each State, and add them all together and divide the &s;um by thirteen, and the quotient will be the mean exchange or va|lue of the currency. For in&s;tance, by the be&s;t advice I can collect, the exchange la&s;t Chri&s;tmas, or December 25, 1779, was, in the four New-England States, New-York, North and South Carolina and Georgia, <HI>i. e.</HI> in eight States, at thirty-five for one, and in New-Jer&s;ey, Penn&s;ylvania, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia, <HI>i. e.</HI> in five States, at forty for one, their &s;ums will &s;tand thus,&mdash;

</TABLE>
which &s;um divided by thirteen gives a quotient of 36 12/13 or 37 nearly, which I &s;uppo&s;e to be the true mean exchange or averaged value of the currency, through all the thirteen States, at that time. The pre|&s;ent exchange in this city is forty-five to one, and the exchange was ri&s;ing both to the ea&s;tward and &s;outhward when the la&s;t advices came away, &s;o that I &s;uppo&s;e the pre&s;ent mean exchange may &s;afely and truly be fixed at forty for one, but our future advices will &s;oon determine this beyond all doubt. This is throwing a&s;ide all theory and &s;pecu|lation, and grounding my computation entirely on fact, and is a method which I expect will be allowed to be fair, true and unexcep|tionable; <HI>and at this value I propo&s;e that the currency &s;hould be fixed at pre&s;ent, and be finally redeemed at the &s;ame.</HI> Both the&s;e I conceive very ju&s;t and practicable. I do not think there is any ju&s;tice in taxing the public to appreciate any man's money in his che&s;t beyond the pre&s;ent value. This would be burdening the public, merely for the benefit of a few individuals of monied men; for I before ob&s;erved that no per&s;on could take benefit of &s;uch an appreciation, but &s;uch as have more money on hand than all their taxes for redeeming the whole currency will amount to; and tho&s;e few among us who have &s;uch a &s;urplus of money are the men who have the lea&s;t occa&s;ion of a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the public, and in general have the lea&s;t right to expect or even to wi&s;h it. For a further con&s;ideration of this I refer back to all the rea&s;ons I have given again&s;t an appreciation. On the other hand, it will be readily granted that every principle of ju&s;tice requires that any further depreciation of our currency &s;hould, if po&s;&s;ible, be prevented. The <HI>practicability</HI> of both the&s;e, <HI>i. e. of fixing the currency,</HI> de&s;erves our mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration; and here, notwith&s;tanding the unnaccount|able and &s;eemingly capricious fluctuation of the exchange, both in progre&s;&s;ive and retrograde motion (for we have frequently &s;een both) yet I &s;ay, this notwith&s;tanding, I do contend <HI>there are great natural
<PB N="9" REF="017064_0008_0F9FBFCF3965E4B8">
principles, which, if properly applied, will confine this &s;lippery &s;ubject, fix it to a point, and prevent &s;uch fluctuation as will greatly prejudice its u&s;e.</HI>&mdash;To prevent an APPRECIATION,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. As the currency has no real fixed value in it&s;elf, it is nece&s;&s;ary that <HI>it &s;hould be connected, tied or fa&s;tened firmly to &s;omething that is fixed, which may hold it &s;teady,</HI> as an anchor does a &s;hip, which keeps its place by that connection, let the wind or tide &s;et either way. Such a fixed medium is hard money, the value of which cannot vary much from its value in Europe, and therefore its permanency may be &s;afely depended on. To this end I propo&s;e, 1&s;t. <HI>That an order of Congre&s;s be pa&s;&s;ed, that hard money &s;hall be received for taxes and all other pay|ments into the Continental Trea&s;ury, at the pre&s;ent value or fixed exchange;</HI> &s;ay forty for one. For as the demand for taxes will be very great and univer&s;al, if the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of taxation be carried into effectual execution, as it doubtle&s;s will be, it will not be po&s;&s;ible for any man to get a better exchange than is received in the public trea&s;ury. 2d. <HI>I propo&s;e that a re&s;olution pa&s;s to redeem the whole currency finally at the pre&s;ent value;</HI> &s;ay forty for one. This will effectually take away all inducement to rai&s;e the value of it beyond the exchange which can finally be obtained for it, when it &s;hall be redeemed. I do apprehend that my rea&s;ons before a&s;&s;igned again&s;t the apprecia|tion will prove the ju&s;tice, good policy and nece&s;&s;ity of the&s;e re&s;o|lutions, to which I therefore refer. 3d. <HI>I propo&s;e that all public e&s;timates, quotas, payments, &amp;c. be made in hard money, or continental equal to it at the current exchange,</HI> and al&s;o <HI>that all judgments of courts, fees, &s;alaries,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>&s;hould be made up in the &s;ame manner,</HI> that &s;o no public community or private per&s;on &s;hould receive either injury or benefit from any future fluctuation of the currency, either up or down, if &s;uch &s;hould happen, any farther than his ca&s;h on hand might be affected by it. This would not only be an effectual remedy of the crying inju&s;tice, both public and private, which has too long prevailed among us, but will al&s;o take away the principal induce|ment and temptation to attempt any fluctuation of the currency. And 4th. I propo&s;e, for the more effectual operation of this remedy, <HI>that all the tender acts, all laws again&s;t dealing in hard money, and every other of that nature which now &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in any</HI> of the States, may be repealed. I think that a late writer, under the &s;ignature of Adol|phus, has treated this &s;ubject with great judgment and propriety; and as tho&s;e acts were mo&s;tly made on the recommendation of Con|gre&s;s, I apprehend a recommendation of that honourable body to the &s;everal States for &s;uch repeal might be nece&s;&s;ary.&mdash;It appears to me that the&s;e propo&s;itions will mo&s;t effectually prevent any future appre|ciation of our currency: But it may be &s;aid here, we are &s;ufficiently out of danger of that, the pre&s;ent labour is to &s;top the depreciation. But I do not know all this. I have many rea&s;ons to fear an appreciation, which would be a very ruinous calamity if it &s;hould happen, and I think we may do well to u&s;e precautions again&s;t a po&s;&s;ible evil; and I have at lea&s;t the common argument of quacks in favour of my propo&s;itions, that they are innocent, they can do no hurt, and they

If the event to which they are de&s;igned to be applied &s;hould happen, they will be of the utmo&s;t u&s;e and benefit; if that event &s;hould not happen, their operation will be prevented, and no bad effects can proceed from them, I am as &s;en&s;ible as any man of the urgent nece&s;&s;ity of preventing a farther depreciation, and therefore recur to &s;uch great natural principles as I think will mo&s;t effectually and a&s;&s;uredly remedy the mi&s;chief; and here I hope it will not be taken ami&s;s, if I repeat &s;ome things I have heretofore advanced; for great truths, and weighty principles of deci&s;ive im|portance, ought often to be repeated, that they may be better kept in mind.

<P N="2">2d. To ob&s;erve, that <HI>one great cau&s;e of depreciation is the increa&s;e of the quantity of our currency, and therefore the quantity mu&s;t by no means be increa&s;ed.</HI> For it is not po&s;&s;ible to prevent the operation of &s;uch increa&s;e on the depreciation. It matters not in what &s;hape &s;uch an increa&s;e may appear, whether <HI>of continental bills, certificates, bills on Europe, or bills of particular States.

And this brings me to the con&s;ideration of ano|ther great principle&punc; on which the credit of all bills mu&s;t depend, viz. 4th. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>final redemption of the bills mu&s;t be made certain, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> exchange at which they &s;hall be finally paid or redeemed mu&s;t be certainly known.</HI> If there is any doubt of either of the&s;e in the minds of the people, that doubt will le&s;&s;en the value of the bills; for a certainty will always be better than an uncertainty, <HI>i. e.</HI> the credit of the States mu&s;t &s;tand &s;o firmly connected with their real &s;ub&s;tance, that there can be no doubt but the one will be &s;upported by the other. The life and u&s;e of money lies in a quick and ready circulation; yet, although this circulation &s;hould be ever &s;o bri&s;k, if it pa&s;&s;es from hand to hand, like <HI>Robin's alive,</HI> in con&s;tant danger of dying in the la&s;t hand, it mu&s;t, notwith&s;tanding all its &s;igns of life and vigour, depreciate fa&s;t; and <HI>I conceive a general confidence or doubt of this kind has operated more on our currency than people are gene|rally aware of.</HI> In the gloomy a&s;pect of our affairs in the winter of 1778, when the Briti&s;h army had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Philadelphia, the ex|change ro&s;e to &s;ix, &s;even and eight for one. In the &s;ummer and fall of the &s;ame year, when we begun to feel the great effects of General Gates's &s;ucce&s;s, the Engli&s;h &s;ued for peace and their army left Philadel|phia, our alliance with France was formed, with a pro&s;pect of the ac|ce&s;&s;ion of Spain, and a powerful French fleet was on our coa&s;t, the ex|change fell to four for one, and kept down for many months together; but when our &s;anguine expectations began to abate, new difficulties

aro&s;e, and the multiplied emi&s;&s;ions had &s;welled the quantity of our cur|rency to an enormous amount, beyond any probability or even po&s;&s;ibi|lity of payment at fall value, there en&s;ued a great abatement of the ge|neral confidence, and mighty doubts aro&s;e whether it would ever be redeemed at all, or, if it was, at what value; and the&s;e doubts in|crea&s;ed with the increa&s;e of the quantity, and &s;ome other cau&s;es, till the exchange ro&s;e up to the enormous height which now exi&s;ts. The principal cau&s;es of the&s;e doubts, and con&s;equently of the deprecia|tion, I take it, have been <HI>the uncertainty of the fate of the war, or &s;upport of our Independence, and the increa&s;ing enormous &s;um of our cur|rency.</HI> I conceive all doubts ari&s;ing from the fir&s;t of the&s;e cau&s;es are pretty well done away. I think it is &s;o far from remaining a doubt whether we &s;hall &s;upport our Independence, that <HI>I do not apprehend it is in our power to give it up&punc; if we were willing,</HI> and to fall back into the dominion of Great-Britain. I am of opinion that France and Spain, and perhaps &s;ome other powers, mu&s;t be con|quered, before the trade or government of America can be permitted to be monopolized and controuled by Great Britain. The va&s;t extent of our country, the fertility of our &s;oil, &s;alubrity of our climates, with other natural advantages, together with the rapid increa&s;e of our people, agriculture and arts, make us an object of va&s;t import|ance, expectation and attention with every trading country of Europe, and they will not ea&s;ily give up the &s;hare of profit which they expect to derive from us. If we continue to increa&s;e as we have done in time pa&s;t, that is, to double every twenty-five years, the thirteen States will contain more people, at the end of the next century, than France, Spain and Great-Britain together all contain at pre&s;ent. All Europe gaze with attention on our ri&s;ing greatne&s;s, and it is a pity that America, like &s;ome carele&s;s beauty, &s;hould be the only per&s;on in the company in|&s;en&s;ible of her charms. It is time for us to know our own importance, and not throw our&s;elves away in a needle&s;s de&s;pondency As to the doubts ari&s;ing from the great quantity of our currency, and the con|&s;equent uncertainty of its redemption, I conceive they will be effectu|ally removed by the foregoing propo&s;itions. The pre&s;ent debt of con|tinental money cea&s;es to appear enormous; it does not exceed five millions of hard dollars, which is le&s;s than two dollars per head on the inhabitants; a light burden! a trifle! not adequate to the abili|ties of the poore&s;t town in the thirteen States. The only remaining doubt is, whether the &s;tates will in fact pay this &s;um, &s;mall as it is. This doubt appears to me ridiculous; for were we to &s;uppo&s;e there was not a grain of honour or hone&s;ty left in the thirteen States, on which we could depend for the payment of their debts, yet they have &s;uffered &s;o much by the depreciation of their currency, that they will, from a principle of &s;elf pre&s;ervation, remedy the mi&s;chief, and pre|vent it in future. A burnt child dreads the fire, and certainly we have not lo&s;t all the feelings of human nature, however callous we may be to the inducements of moral principles. But <HI>my confidence, even in the morality of the States, is not &s;haken, it is entire.</HI> It is my opinion our people are able and willing to do all that is nece&s;&s;ary to
<PB N="12" REF="017064_0011_0F9FBFD1696A3FC8">
be done in the pre&s;ent cri&s;is. Nothing more is or can be nece&s;&s;ary, than to put the matter in a proper train of operation. Let the people &s;ee the expenditures made with prudence and oeconomy; that the de|mand of public money is grounded on public nece&s;&s;ity only; let them &s;ee men acting in the offices, through which the public monies are to pa&s;s, in whom they can have confidence; let them &s;ee a &s;y&s;tem of fi|nance formed which &s;hall appear both practicable and &s;ufficient, and put under &s;uch direction as &s;hall afford a good probability of prudent management and effectual execution; let the&s;e things be done (and I do not take them to be mountains impracticable) and I conceive our public faith will be effectually re&s;tored, and ri&s;e to &s;uch a degree of re&s;pectability, that no branch of the revenue will dare to defraud the trea&s;ury, or withhold the &s;upplies nece&s;&s;ary to the public &s;afety; nor, on the other hand, will our public faith prove a ruinous and infa|mous trap to tho&s;e who have tru&s;ted their fortunes to its &s;ecurity. I do not pretend the&s;e are light matters and without difficulty. <HI>The forming a &s;y&s;tem of finance is an arduous work, fully equal to the abilities of a per&s;on of the &s;tronge&s;t intellects, &s;teady attention, and aptitude to the &s;ub|ject. It mu&s;t be the work of</HI> ONE MIND, capable of the nece&s;&s;ary at|tention to all the parts, and able &s;o to comprehend and arrange the whole, as to form a &s;y&s;tem both practicable and &s;ufficient. <HI>I do not think any aggregate body of men on earth able to do this.</HI> I am of opinion that we might as well expect that a General A&s;&s;embly, a Parliament, a Diet of an Empire, or a Congre&s;s, could de&s;cribe and demon&s;trate the properties of the &s;phere, compute the force of falling bodies, de|fine the laws of hydro&s;taticks, or make an almanack, as well as form a &s;y&s;tem of finance. The power of &s;uperintendence and legal &s;anc|tion is theirs, but the calculation and execution of the &s;y&s;tem is not, in my humble opinion, compatible to the &s;enatorial body. The Bri|ti&s;h Parliament, &s;ome years ago, aboli&s;hed the Julian &s;tile and adop|ted the Gregorian, and gave it legal &s;anction, to the great &s;atisfaction and benefit of the kindom, but I never heard any man &s;uppo&s;e that that Parliament was ever capable of calculating or demon&s;trating either of the &s;tiles: yet I do not apprehend that it is any reflection on the dignity, abilities or competency of that Parliament to &s;uppo&s;e, that, if no body could have calculated &s;tiles better than they could, we might have done without any till this time, and computed the ad|vance of the &s;pring by the budding of the white-oak trees, as the In|dians do. The con&s;equence from all this is, in my opinion, that if a &s;enatorial body want &s;tiles, &s;y&s;tems of finance, or any things el&s;e which require peculiar abilities, &s;uch as by common probability cannot be pre&s;umed to exi&s;t in &s;uch a body, they can only manife&s;t their wi&s;dom and employ their authority in appointing men of proper abilities to make them; then the Senate can examine and correct them, and add their &s;anction and authority, put the execution of them under a proper direction, and keep the &s;uperintendance only in them&s;elves. I think it may ea&s;ily appear, that <HI>the nature of the &s;ubject limits the powers of a Senate to this line of conduct.</HI> But were it not &s;o, good policy would pre&s;cribe this method; for <HI>the ground of finance is every &s;tep of it mo&s;t
<PB N="13" REF="017064_0012_0F9FBFD218A86890">
dangerous ground.</HI> Errors are at fir&s;t imperceptible and ea&s;ily made, but &s;oon &s;hoot up into capital importance, and often a&s;&s;ume a mo&s;t hideous and gha&s;tly appearance; all which is apt to throw di&s;grace and cen&s;ure, and &s;ometimes contempt, on the authors. That which proceeded from ignorance may be attributed to bad de&s;ign. In any view, mi&s;takes and di&s;appointments prove the ignorance or imper|fection of the managers, and there will always be &s;ome degree of contempt due to per&s;ons who undertake things which they know not how to perform. <HI>Bodies of &s;upreme dignity ought never to incur cen&s;ures or a&s;per&s;ions of this &s;ort. The public always &s;uffers, when the wi&s;dom or integrity of their &s;upreme power is called at all into que&s;tion.</HI> They ought therefore, in all good policy, to appoint proper per&s;ons to do all bu&s;ine&s;s of this &s;ort, were it only that they might have a &s;cape|goat to bear away from them&s;elves the cen&s;ure, di&s;grace and contempt, which any errors might occa&s;ion, when they came to be di&s;covered; for it is very ob&s;ervable, that when any error or mi&s;conduct happens in any great department of the State, the blame always falls on the officer under who&s;e direction it was made. No part of the cen&s;ure ever falls on the &s;upreme power, unle&s;s it is that of making a corrupt or injudicious appointment of the officer, or taking the management of the matter out of his hands by too particular in&s;tructions.</P>
<P>On the whole matter, our country abounds with men and every &s;ort of &s;upplies we need (military &s;tores and cloathing excepted, which are ea&s;ily attainable from abroad.) Our public councils and mea&s;ures are very little ob&s;tructed by di&s;putes or parties in oppo&s;ition. The great thing wanted is, to put our finances into &s;uch a train, order or &s;y&s;tem, as will revive the public credit, bring our currency into &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;hed value and demand, as is nece&s;&s;ary to its nature and u&s;e, and enable the public to call into u&s;e &s;uch &s;ervices and &s;up|plies as are nece&s;&s;ary to the public &s;afety. That the abilities requi&s;ite to form and execute &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem are not to be found or expected in any &s;enatorial body, <HI>i. e.</HI> by common probability it cannot be pre|&s;umed, that the component members of &s;uch a body &s;hould be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed of the rare and peculiar abilities requi&s;ite for this great purpo&s;e. It remains then a matter of the highe&s;t and mo&s;t urgent nece&s;&s;ity, that a &s;uitable per&s;on for the great office of Financier-General, or Super|intendant of Finance, &s;hould be looked up and appointed as &s;oon as may be, who&s;e &s;ole bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould be to in&s;pect and controul our whole revenue and expenditures, and keep them in balance with each other. I imagine this high office will not be very greedily &s;ought or eagerly accepted by any per&s;on capable of it. It will require the mo&s;t unwearied, unremitted application, the mo&s;t inten&s;e and fixed attention to a &s;ubject of a mo&s;t intricate nature and great extent; the heart-felt intere&s;ts, the lo&s;s or gain, the injury or benefit of millions, will &s;tand clo&s;ely connected with his conclu&s;ions and management, and of cour&s;e his errors, if he makes any (as from the intricacy and va&s;t extent of the &s;ubject he undoubtedly mu&s;t) his errors, I &s;ay, will incur the &s;evere re&s;entment, and rai&s;e the mercile&s;s cry of the incon|&s;iderate and ill-natured, which make a con&s;iderable part of the world;
<PB N="14" REF="017064_0013_0F9FBFD2E0826EF8">
and after all, if he conducts with &s;ucce&s;s, he will get little prai&s;e; for every thing in his way will go &s;moothly on in a regular train, which will &s;oon grow familiar, and of cour&s;e unnoticed, and not one in a thou&s;and will know to whom they are indebted for their tranquility. Be&s;ides, I do not know that the pre&s;ent con|fu&s;ions of our revenue are capable of being &s;peedily reduced to order by any addre&s;s of wi&s;dom, &s;kill and diligence, and &s;hould he fail, the weighty burden will cru&s;h him in an in&s;tant, and he may fall, like <HI>Pha&euml;ton,</HI> ridiculous and unpitied, for undertaking a work for which, perhaps, any degree of human wi&s;dom or ability may prove in&s;ufficient. Be this as it may, much will depend on the choice of this officer. Should an in&s;ufficient man be appointed, his defects or mi&s;management will not only be &s;everely felt while he is in office, but mo&s;t probably his &s;ucce&s;&s;or may find a more difficult ta&s;k to correct his errors, than to have taken up the matter new, and &s;et out right at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>But to return to the main point; the great que&s;tion &s;eems now to be, whether, in any practicable train or method, <HI>it would be po&s;&s;ible to rai&s;e money among our&s;elves equal to the nece&s;&s;ary expenditures,</HI> i. e. whether the people could pay &s;uch a large &s;um. To this I an&s;wer, the be&s;t method of judging of the mighty wealth and abilities of the States is, by reflecting on what they have paid in times pa&s;t. The expences of the war for five years pa&s;t have been about eleven millions of hard dollars per annum, be&s;ides the loans, as will ea&s;ily appear by computing the value of the bills emitted each year; and this has been all paid, except five millions, and that in the wor&s;t, mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing and oppre&s;&s;ive method that could be devi&s;ed, viz. by the depreciation of the currency. The payments of the la&s;t year, 1779, which were actually made, were about double the &s;aid &s;um, for on the la&s;t day of the year 1778, the whole currency was about one hundred and thirty-three millions, of which at lea&s;t one hundred and twelve millions of dollars were in circulation, and the exchange was &s;ix to one; con&s;equently one hundred and twelve millions, divided by &s;ix, gives in hard money the amount of our debt of continental money, viz. eighteen millions and &s;even hundred thou&s;and dollars, to which add the expenditures of the year 1779, viz. about one hundred and &s;ixty-five millions of dollars. To find the value of this we mu&s;t divide it by the mean exchange of the year, which I conceive may be found by multiplying the exchange at the end of the year 1778, viz. &s;ix for one, by the exchange at the end of the year 1779, viz. forty, which makes a product of two hundred and forty, the &s;quare root of which, viz. 15,5 nearly, is the mean exchange, and the &s;um of expenditures of 1779, viz. one hundred and &s;ixty five millions, divided by &s;aid mean exchange, viz. 15,5, gives for quotient nearly 10&frac23; millions of hard dollars, which added to the amount of the debt at the end of the year 1778, viz. 18,700,000, makes &s;omewhat more than twenty-nine millions; out of which &s;ubtract the debt now remaining, viz. five millions, there remains twenty-four millions of hard dollars, which have been
<PB N="15" REF="017064_0014_0F9FBFD391536CC0">
actually paid by the thirteen States in the year 1779. The que&s;|tion is then reduced to this, viz. Whether it is not only po&s;&s;ible, but much ea&s;ier to pay eleven millions of hard dollars in &s;ome equitable mode, which di&s;tributes the burden on all in due pro|portion to their abilities, than it was la&s;t year to pay more than dou|ble that &s;um in the mo&s;t unequal and oppre&s;&s;ive way imaginable. I know it will require &s;trong exertions, but we began the war with this expectation and re&s;olution, and I do not think our people will &s;hrink or give back under the burden when it comes. Be&s;ides, it does not appear to me po&s;&s;ible to increa&s;e our circulating ca&s;h in any way, without further depreciating it, which at once de&s;troys its u&s;e, and the very end we &s;hould have in view by increa&s;ing it. Loans will do this; for every loan makes a new certificate or bill of &s;ome &s;ort, and all the&s;e will flow into circulation as &s;oon as they gain that e&s;tabli&s;hed value which they ought to have, and which they mu&s;t have before we can borrow without a lo&s;s or di&s;count. I think it manife&s;tly rea&s;onable, <HI>that all loan-office certificates &s;hould be redeemed at the exchange which ex|i&s;ted at their dates, and that there &s;hould be a rate of exchange from the fir&s;t depreciation down to the pre&s;ent time made, to a&s;certain the exchange at the time when each bill was dated, and a &s;ure intere&s;t, in proportion to the value of the principal, &s;hould be &s;ecured to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, until the certi|ficate &s;hall be paid.</HI> If this was done, we might borrow, perhaps, without a di&s;count or lo&s;s, and keep our debt at home, which would be much better than drawing bills on Europe at a lo&s;s of fifty per cent. and contracting a hard money debt abroad. But this is digre&s;|&s;ion. To return to my &s;ubject, I do not really &s;ee but that general and heavy taxes are mo&s;t ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to give demand to our currency, animate the indu&s;try of our people, and bani&s;h idlene&s;s, &s;peculation, and a thou&s;and vi&s;ionary projects, which prevail to an alarming degree, and which mu&s;t vani&s;h into nothing &s;oon, and there|fore the &s;ooner the better. Taxes will increa&s;e the circulation of our currency, which will increa&s;e its u&s;e quite up to the full amount ne|ce&s;&s;ary to all our needs, nor can I &s;ee any other way in which we can carry on the war, without incurring &s;uch an enormous debt at the end of it, as will mix even the joys of e&s;tabli&s;hed liberty with bitterne&s;s, and even endanger that very liberty it&s;elf for which we have &s;o &s;tre|nuou&s;ly contended, and for which the debt it&s;elf was contracted. The writer of three letters on appreciation has advi&s;ed us to &s;et the pre&s;&s;es a going again, and in the plenitude of calculation made out that the depreciation or exchange, at the end of the year 1780, would in that ca&s;e be about &s;ixty-eight to one; but had he founded his cal|culation on fact (on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the depreciation would be no greater this year than it was la&s;t, which is not true) he would have found the depreciation or exchange, at the end of the year 1780, at lea&s;t two hundred and &s;ixty-&s;ix to one, and probably it would be more than double, perhaps the treble of that exchange, if it &s;hould contine to pa&s;s at all thro' the year, which is far from a certainty. This method then will not do. From all which it appears pretty plain we have but two things before us, viz. to rai&s;e as much mo|ney
<PB N="16" REF="017064_0015_0F9FBFD49F1ECFE8">
as will be &s;ufficient to pay our expenditures as we go; or, if we can not do this, to reduce our expenditures to the &s;um which we can pay. For to talk of keeping up a greater expence than we can pay any how, is ab&s;urd and ridiculous to a very contemptible degree. To borrow abroad is ruinous, and nothing is plainer than that we cannot hold it out long in this way; and what is wor&s;e, our enemies mu&s;t know this, and thereby be encouraged to continue the war again&s;t us. To borrow at home de&s;troys the very end and u&s;e of the loan as it goes. The great purpo&s;e cannot be &s;erved in this way. <HI>What we can rai&s;e among our&s;elves is all that we can pay, and we cannot attempt expenditures beyond this without bankruptcy.</HI> A peace cannot be expect|ed till the end of the great conte&s;t between three of the greate&s;t powers of Europe, which may involve more powers in the di&s;pute. It is a matter of &s;uch high point of honour, pride and intere&s;t with them all, e&s;pecially Great-Britain, that they will &s;train the la&s;t nerve for &s;uperiority before they will yield an ace, and the war may la&s;t many years; the con&s;equence of all this is, that <HI>we mu&s;t take up the matter as we can hold out.</HI> A man who has a long race before him is mad, if he exhau&s;ts all his &s;trength in the fir&s;t mile. A certain degree of exertion we are capable of, beyond which we cannot go; within this we mu&s;t keep and confine our&s;elves. This degree ought to be calculated with great judgment, and u&s;ed with great oeconomy, and with the mo&s;t effect it will bear, but it cannot be exceeded with|out the mighty and tremendous danger of final ruin. The&s;e are my be&s;t thoughts, the &s;ubject is too va&s;t, too unexplored for my compre|hen&s;ion. This is my fourth addre&s;s to the public on this weighty theme. I am obliged for the favourable reception of the other three, hope the &s;ame candor will be extended to this. My thoughts are free, the nature and incidents of the &s;ubject dictate my argument. Great natural principles will always make their own way in the end, and if they are ever rejected, it is becau&s;e they are not rightly appre|hended, and any departure from them will be checked and reformed by dear experience. My clo&s;e attention to this great and intricate &s;ubject has taught me that it baffles all &s;peculative theory and calcu|lation. The only &s;afe ba&s;is of every principle of rea&s;oning on it mu&s;t be fact or experiment. Here I drop my pen, ready to &s;tand corrected by the better thoughts and more u&s;eful di&s;coveries of any &s;uperior genius.</P>
