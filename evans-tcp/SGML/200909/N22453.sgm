<P>THE &s;hip Two Friends being at la&s;t re|paired and ready for &s;ea, I have now the hon|our to enclo&s;e you herein invoice and bill of lading of &s;undry merchandizes, &s;hipped on your account and ri&s;que, amounting to livres a&s;&s;ignats 404056 3.

I further enclo&s;e you a bill on my brother for 1000 dollars.&mdash;As al&s;o a receipt from Capt. Williams for 900 dollars, which he will deliver you immediately after his arrival.</P>
<P>Your &s;hips delay here has been unfortunately very long, but taking into con&s;ideration the ma|ny difficulties under which the laboured it is not too long a time. Mr. S. cannot well form an idea to him&s;elf of the tedious manner of doing bu&s;ine&s;s here, who is accu&s;tomed to &s;o much ac|tivity. In order to get a &s;ingle permit for goods it requires two or three days at lea&s;t, and the number of holidays which at pre&s;ent are kept in France makes mercantile bu&s;ine&s;s very difficult to be tran&s;acted.&mdash;On Sunday the people do not any bu&s;ine&s;s and on Decade-days all public offi|ces are &s;hut.</P>
<P>I am extremely &s;orry it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to return in the &s;hip Two Friends, as there &s;till remains about &s;ixty hog&s;heads of tobacco un&s;old; and I &s;hould not wi&s;h to leave France without having the accounts of the voyage completed. From appearances tobacco will rai&s;e con&s;idera|bly in value and is in demand.</P>
<P>I dare &s;ay &s;hould the Two Friends arrive &s;afe in port, the merchandize which I have &s;hipped on your account will an&s;wer very well, as goods of the &s;ame kind are &s;eventy or eighty per cent dearer now than they were at the time of pur|cha&s;e. I hope Capt. Mc. C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l, of the &s;hip Iris, may have arrived &s;afe at New-York with the goods &s;hipped on your account.</P>
<P>My apprehen&s;ions re&s;pecting war with Great-Britain are very con&s;iderable, notwith&s;tanding (as is reported here) a treaty has been ratified in England by Mr. Jay. The Briti&s;h cruizers take all American ve&s;&s;els bound to France load|ed

with provi&s;ions. A brig belonging to Mr. Meade of Philadelphia, and cleared out for Nantz, was boarded by an Engli&s;h frigate in the bay; who put a prize-ma&s;ter and &s;everal men on board to carry her into Port&s;mouth: But the captain and American &s;eamen who were left in the brig found means to make drunk the prize-ma&s;ter and his men&mdash;In which time they retook po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ve&s;&s;el and brought her &s;afe in here.</P>
<P>The late Dauphin of France is dead and Lux|embourg is taken by the French:&mdash;The death of the &s;on of Capet will occa&s;ion &s;ome altera|tion with re&s;pect to &s;ome of the powers at war with France.&mdash;The Spani&s;h government de|manded as one of their terms on which it would agree to a peace, the delivery of the dauphin up to them&mdash;&s;ome &s;u&s;picions are at this time form|ed of his not dying a natural death.</P>
<P>A &s;erious fire took place a few days ago, at Paimboeuf, by which &s;ix fine &s;hips were burnt, as you will &s;ee by the account given in the Nantz papers. I wi&s;hed much for a few lines from you, but I &s;uppo&s;e you expected my de|parture from this before the arrival of the ve&s;|&s;els which &s;ailed not long &s;ince from Philadel|phia.

<P>KNOW YE, that this third day of November, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and ninety five, before me the governor, per&s;onally appeared Capt. Samuel Williams, ma&s;ter of the &s;hip Two Friends, who being duly &s;worn on the Holy Evangeli&s;ts of Almighty God, depo&s;eth and &s;aith, that he &s;ailed from Nantz, in France, on the twenty fir&s;t day of June la&s;t pa&s;t, (as ma&s;ter of the &s;aid &s;hip) bound for Philadelphia, in the United States of America, with a cargo con&s;i&s;ting of wine, fruit, dry goods, &s;ome gold and &s;ilver watches, nine hundred dollars in &s;pe|cie, and &s;undry other articles of merchandize, (all belonging to citizens of the &s;aid United States) and having al&s;o on board fourteen pa&s;&s;en|gers. That after &s;uch his departure, nothing of moment occurred till the &s;econd day of Augu&s;t, when in latitude 38, 40, and in longitude 72,0, We&s;t from London, he was boarded by a Ber|mudian privateer &s;loop, called the Favorite, and commanded by Capt. Jo&s;iah Ba&s;den, who de|manded the appearer's papers and afterwards took out the greate&s;t part of the appearer's crew, putting on board a prizema&s;ter and crew of his
<PB N="101" REF="029667_0101_0FE216E7B54EB698">
own, and ordering them to proceed with the &s;hip Two Friends for Bermuda, where &s;he ar|rived on the 15th of the &s;ame month.&mdash;And the appearer &s;aith that the captors proceeded the next day to &s;earch the trunks and baggage of the pa&s;&s;engers, but found nothing except their apparel and bedding&mdash;That on the &s;eventeenth the Two Friends was libelled in the court of vice admiralty for the&s;e i&s;lands, with her cargo, as French property, and her hatches &s;ealed up &mdash;That on the twenty fir&s;t, the mar&s;hal of the &s;aid court, with the captain and agent of the &s;aid privateer, vi&s;ited the &s;aid &s;hip and carried a&s;hore the watches and money before mention|ed, and al&s;o examined the appearer's trunks, but took nothing out of them&mdash;And the appearer further &s;aith, that on the &s;eventh and eighth of September the before named per&s;ons, with &s;eve|ral others, came on board the Two Friends and overhauled the trunks and ca&s;ks of dry goods and hoi&s;ted up &s;ome of the ca&s;ks of wine, after which they &s;towed away the wine and dry goods, and &s;ealed up the hatches again&mdash;And the appearer further depo&s;eth and &s;aith, that having thought it nece&s;&s;ary to employ a proctor, the &s;aid proctor did on the third of September (at the reque&s;t and in behalf of the appearer) interpo&s;e a claim for the &s;aid &s;hip and cargo, as neutral property, belonging to certain citizens of the United States of America, as afore|&s;aid &mdash;That on the eleventh of the &s;aid month the cau&s;e was argued before the honora|ble John Green E&s;quire, judge of the &s;aid court, who on the &s;ixteenth promulged his decree, thereby ordering re&s;toration of the &s;aid &s;hip Two Friends to the claimant, together with the pri|vate adventures belonging to the appearer and his crew, but condemning the cargo of the &s;aid &s;hip, as lawful prize to the captors, &s;ubject to the
<PB N="102" REF="029667_0102_0FE216E94A423498">
payment of freight, and burthening the claim|ant with co&s;ts of &s;uit&mdash;That the appearer con|ceiving the &s;aid decree to be highly oppre&s;&s;ive and unju&s;t (ina&s;much as the whole of the pro|perty ought, in his opinion, to have been ac|quitted and the captors condemned in co&s;ts and damages for the illegal capture thereof,) thought fit to appeal therefrom to the high court of ap|peals in Great-Britain, whereupon the captors, with a profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign of harra&s;&s;ing and embar|ra&s;&s;ing the appearer, and of deterring him, if po&s;&s;ible, from perfecting &s;uch appeal, entered a cro&s;s-appeal for the &s;aid &s;hip and freight, in con|&s;equence of which a warrant was i&s;&s;ued, autho|rizing certain per&s;ons to apprai&s;e the &s;aid &s;hip and cargo&mdash;That the &s;aid apprai&s;ers having made their return to the court of their valuation of the &s;aid &s;hip (but not of the cargo) the appearer attended the &s;aid judge Green on the twenty ninth of September (when Samuel Ewing was al&s;o pre&s;ent) for the purpo&s;e of &s;ti|pulating for the &s;aid &s;hip at her apprai&s;ed value, and offered Me&s;&s;rs. James and William Perot, one of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable hou&s;es in the&s;e i&s;lands, as the appearer has been informed, for his &s;ecu|rities; the &s;aid James Perot attending at the &s;ame time with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r; but the appearer &s;aith, that the competency of the &s;aid James and William Perot, was neverthele&s;s object|ed to, on the part of the captors, and their &s;ecurity rejected by the court&mdash;That the &s;aid captors, at the &s;ame time, offered to take the &s;aid &s;hip at her valuation, and to give good and &s;ufficient &s;ecurity for the &s;ame, and actual|ly named the per&s;ons they &s;hould produce as their &s;ecurity, whom the court agreed to accept, but that after a delay of &s;everal days on the
<PB N="103" REF="029667_0103_0FE216EAD87BFD78">
part of the captors, the appearer's proctor pre&s;&s;|ed the court, either to oblige the &s;aid captors to &s;tipulate with &s;ecurity, for the value of the &s;aid &s;hip, as they had undertaken to do, or to di&s;|mi&s;s their appeal, they having neglected to com|ply with their engagement and in&s;i&s;ting to have the ve&s;&s;el &s;old under the direction of the court, for the mo&s;t &s;he would yield, but that the judge of the &s;aid court refu&s;ed to grant &s;uch motion, declaring however, that he would accept the ap|pearer's &s;ecurity&mdash;That the appearer according|ly again produced his &s;ecurity on the twentieth of October, by which means he got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his &s;hip, which the captors, as the appearer chargeth, &s;trove all in their power to prevent. &mdash;And the appearer complaineth and &s;aith, that when he, the appearer, attended the &s;aid judge of the court of vice-admiralty the fir&s;t time, with his &s;ecurity, for the value of the &s;aid &s;hip, his proctor and coun&s;el, Benjamin Dickin&s;on Harvey, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> in order to keep the court within the &s;trict rules of fair practice, and that no un|due advantage may be taken by the captors, par|ticularly cautioned the court, by no means to &s;uffer any proceeding to be had relative to the cargo of the &s;aid &s;hip, (the apprai&s;ement of which was not fini&s;hed at that time, or return|ed) without his being duly notified thereof, to the end that he may have an opportunity of making all ju&s;t exceptions either as to the in&s;uf|ficiency of the &s;ecurity, which might be prof|fered therefore by the captors, or otherwi&s;e, which the &s;aid judge promi&s;ed &s;hould be done, but that the &s;aid judge neverthele&s;s admitted the &s;ecurity for the &s;aid cargo (which the ap|pearer avers was valued very much below its real value) without the con&s;ent or privity of the
<PB N="104" REF="029667_0104_0FE216ED4B1D8CF0">
appearer or his &s;aid proctor, who would certain|ly have objected to &s;uch &s;ecurity upon the ground of its in&s;ufficiency, as the per&s;ons of whom it con&s;i&s;ted, were, as the appearer has been informed, and verily believes to be true, intere&s;ted in the &s;aid privateer, and of cour&s;e, not &s;uch &s;ecurity as the law requires.&mdash;That when the appearer's &s;aid proctor, heard of this tran&s;action, which was not till &s;everal days af|ter it had taken place, he remon&s;trated with great warmth to the &s;aid judge again&s;t the im|propriety and inju&s;tice of the mea&s;ure, which the &s;aid judge never once attempted to ju&s;tify or defend, but declared that he would act differ|ently in future&mdash;And the appearer further &s;aith, that when his &s;aid proctor obtained a &s;ight of the apprai&s;ement of the &s;aid cargo, he in&s;i&s;ted that more particularity ought to have been ob|&s;erved with re&s;pect to the dry goods, and al&s;o pointed out the great deficiency in the cargo, and in an e&s;pecial manner, that a certain quan|tity of &s;taves (part of the outward cargo) which the agent of the privateer had actually taken out of the Two Friends, and converted to his own u&s;e, were in no wi&s;e accounted for, whereupon the &s;aid judge promi&s;ed to attend to the&s;e &s;eve|ral exceptions, but has failed &s;o to do, &s;ave on|ly that he has cau&s;ed &s;ome of the &s;aid &s;taves to be &s;ince added to the apprai&s;ement of the &s;aid cargo&mdash;And the appearer moreover &s;aith, that according to the be&s;t of his belief, he can, and does aver, that at the time of the capture of the &s;aid &s;hip Two Friends, by the &s;aid &s;loop Fa|vorite, her cargo, and particularly her wine and fruit were in prime order, the appearer having taken care to afford all the air in the hold that he po&s;&s;ibly could, and that &s;uch was al&s;o the

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE diligent attention and care, in what concerns me, which you have uniformly di&s;played during your re&s;idence with me, and the recent in&s;tances which I have ob&s;erved, of an attachment in your family, which will always endear them to me, have determined me to confide to your care, during the pre&s;ent voyage, my &s;hip Two Friends, and her cargo of Rice and Tobacco, agreeably to invoice and bills of loading inclo&s;ed herein&mdash;with which you will plea&s;e to proceed to the port of Nantz or Bour|deaux in France, and on your arrival there, make the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible &s;ale of the whole, for my intere&s;t&mdash;Inve&s;ting the proceeds in a cargo of Salt, Brandy, Claret, Oil, Soap, Dry Goods, Prunes, &amp;c, as you &s;hall find be&s;t for my advan|tage, taking care to a&s;&s;ort it, as nearly as po&s;&s;i|ble, on the footing of the note at the bottom of this letter, and to have the one cargo put on board, immediately on di&s;charging the other, making the conditions of the &s;ales accordingly &mdash;The moment the property is on board your ve&s;&s;el, it is under the in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rance I have here made; whereas, when once on &s;hore, it is out of all &s;ecurity as for me&mdash;I have given you ma|ny letters of introduction, to &s;erve you among my friends in France: You mu&s;t; &s;elect &s;uch a&s;|&s;i&s;tance as you in prudence &s;hall find mo&s;t ad|vi&s;eable, and I &s;hall allow you five per cent on &s;ales, and five per cent on the returns, out of which, you mu&s;t pay all charges to tho&s;e who

<P>In making your &s;ales and delivery, attend your&s;elf to the weights, and &s;ee that you are not impo&s;ed on in that matter; examine al&s;o the qualities of Tobacco mo&s;t &s;uitable for the mar|ket you go to, to govern our&s;elves by in future &mdash;&s;ee al&s;o the quality of the goods in return, that they be the be&s;t of their kind&mdash;If after taking in my goods, you have any room left for pa&s;&s;engers or freight, you mu&s;t do the be&s;t po&s;|&s;ible, for my intere&s;t in taking them in&mdash;and ob|&s;erve to do it, &s;o as not to commit my property, with re&s;pect to any of the belligerent powers; as it would be better for me to forego any ad|vantage of this kind, than to have my proper|ty endangered by that means&mdash;If on your ar|rival at Nantz or Bourdeaux, you find any other market in Europe better, you may proceed to it under the in&s;urance I have made, paying 1 per cent additional premium, and in ca&s;e of acci|dent or damage, take great care to have your papers of &s;urveys, prote&s;ts, &amp;c. put in proper order, to &s;ecure my prompt recovery of the un|derwriters.</P>

<SALUTE>HONOR'D SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE &s;hip Two Friends, being at la&s;t repaired and ready for &s;ea, I have now the ho|nor to enclo&s;e you herein, invoice and bill of loading, of &s;undry merchandizes, &s;hipped on your account and ri&s;que, amounting to livres, a&s;&s;ignats, 404056 3&mdash;As al&s;o invoice and bill of loading of &s;undry goods &s;hipped on account of the underwriters, of the cargo of the &s;hip Two Friends, amounting to &pound;250895 18 a&s;&s;ignats, with account, &s;ales, and nece&s;&s;ary papers for your prompt recovery from them&mdash;I further en|clo&s;e you a bill on my brother for 1000 dollars, as al&s;o a receipt from Capt. Williams, for 900 dollars, which he will deliver you immediately after his arrival.</P>
<P>Your &s;hip's delay here, has been unfortunate|ly very long, but taking into con&s;ideration the
<PB N="142" REF="029667_0142_0FE21761F6EAAB88">
many difficulties under which &s;he laboured, it is not too long a time&mdash;Mr. S. cannot well form an idea to him&s;elf of the way of doing bu&s;ine&s;s here, who is &s;o much accu&s;tomed to activity. In order to get a &s;ingle permit for goods it re|quires 2 or 3 days at lea&s;t, and the number of holidays which at pre&s;ent are kept in France make mercantile bu&s;ine&s;s very difficult to be tran&s;acted. On Sundays the people do not any bu&s;ine&s;s, and on decade days all public offices are &s;hut.</P>
<P>I am extremely &s;orry it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to return in the &s;hip Two Friends, as there &s;till remains about 60 hog&s;heads of tobacco un|&s;old, and I &s;hould not wi&s;h to leave France with|out having the accounts of the voyage com|pleated: From pre&s;ent appearances tobacco will rai&s;e con&s;iderably in value, and is in de|mand here&mdash;I dare &s;ay &s;hould the Two Friends arrive &s;afe in port, the merchandizes which I have &s;hipped will an&s;wer very well, as goods of the &s;ame kind are 70 or 80 per cent dearer now than they were at the time of the purcha&s;e. I hope captain M Call, may have arrived &s;afe at New York, with the goods &s;nipped on your ac|count. My apprehen&s;ions re&s;pecting a war with G. Britain are very con&s;iderable, notwith&s;tand|ing (as is reported here) a treaty has been ratified in England, by Mr. Jay&mdash;The Briti&s;h cruizers take all American ve&s;&s;els bound to France, load|ed with provi&s;ion?. A brig belonging to Mr. Meade, of Philadelphia, and cleared out for Nantz, was boarded by an Engli&s;h frigate in the bay, who put a prize ma&s;ter and &s;everal men on board, to carry her into Port&s;mouth; but the ma&s;ter and American &s;eamen who were left on board of the brig, found means to make drunk
<PB N="143" REF="029667_0143_0FE217647B50C4C8">
the prize ma&s;ter, and his men; in which time they retook po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ve&s;&s;el and brought her &s;afe in here.</P>
<P>The late dauphin of France is dead, and Lux|embourg is taken by the French. The death of the &s;on of Capet, will occa&s;ion &s;ome alterati|on with re&s;pect to &s;ome of the powers at war with France. The Spani&s;h government de|manded as one of their terms on which it would agree to a peace, the delivery of the dauphin up to them, &s;ome &s;u&s;picions at this time are formed of his not dying a natural death.</P>
<P>A &s;erious fire took place a few days pa&s;t at Paimboeuf, by which 6 fine &s;hips were con&s;umed, as you will &s;ee by the account given in the Nantz paper.</P>

<P>BY this public in&s;trument of prote&s;t, be it known and made manife&s;t unto all whom the&s;e pre&s;ents &s;hall come, or may in any ways concern, That, on this eighth day of February, in the year one thou&s;and &s;even hundred ninety five; before me Peter Frederick Dobree, vice con&s;ul of the United States, for the port of Nantz, &amp;c. per&s;onnally came and appeared, Sa|muel Williams, ma&s;ter of the &s;hip Two Friends, of Philadelphia, of about three hundred and fif|ty tons burden, who being duly &s;worn, did &s;o|lemnly declare in manner and form following; that he left Philadelphia the fourth of Decem|ber, bound to Nantz in France, with a cargo of four hundred and &s;eventy &s;ix hog&s;heads of tobac|co, one hundred tierces of rice, and twelve thou|&s;and &s;taves, on freight, the wind at north, with a fine fre&s;h breeze&mdash;that the eighth of the &s;aid month, his ve&s;&s;el begun to leak, which obliged him to pump &s;hip every two hours&mdash;that the twenty fir&s;t the wind &s;hifted to &s;outh ea&s;t, and blew very &s;trong, the &s;ea extremely heavy, and the leak encrea&s;ing, they were forced to pump every half hour&mdash;that this bad weather had la&s;t|ed during fifteen days; that the twenty eighth of January, five o'clock A. M the wind being we&s;t north we&s;t, and very thick weather, he has &s;een the land and hoi&s;ted his jack, to call a pilot: that none coming, at five o'clock P. M. his ve&s;&s;el &s;truck the rocks, called Les Char|pentiers, and leaked two feet of water an hour; that he &s;teered at once to get in the river, and got an anchor under &s;ort Maindin, and hoi&s;ted lights for a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but perceiving that his crew could no longer &s;uffice to pump, and hav|ing &s;even to eight feet of water in the hold, he her &s;een him&s;elf &s;acred (to &s;ave the cargo) to

Helmuth, &s;upercargo, to &s;eek &s;uccours on &s;hore. That an inhabitant of &s;aid Brevin got him eight men, who came on board; that the &s;aid day, &s;aid Mr. Helmuth, went to Paimboeuf, and wait|ed on Mr. Boudet, &s;worn interpreter and broker, with whom he made his declaration at the cu&s;|tom hou&s;e, to Mr. Louvet, maritime agent, and to Mr. Lucas, officer of the port, who immedi|ately gave him every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in their power, in getting boats and men; that the thirty fir&s;t of the &s;ame month, at about one o'clock in the morning, he &s;ucceeded to get his &s;hip afloat, having &s;till &s;even to eight feet of water in the hold, although he had con&s;tantly kept men at the pump, and that about one in the afternoon he got on the mud between Point Ville Le Martin and Port S. Nazaire, when he got about forty hands at the pump, and &s;even large boats from from Paimboeuf, which he at once got loaded with rice and tobacco. That having perceived the fir&s;t of February, the pre&s;ent month, that his &s;hip had done leaking, and the wind coming the next day at the north we&s;t, he has &s;ailed for Paimboeuf, and got on the mud there the third in&s;tant, at four o'clock in the morning; and from the&s;e accidents and the length of his pa&s;|&s;age, &s;aid Williams, declares that, both his &s;hip and cargo, mu&s;t be greatly damaged, and there|fore doth &s;olemnly prote&s;t again&s;t wind and weather, as he has already done, before the offi|cers of the cu&s;toms, at Paimboeuf, and now &s;igns the pre&s;ent prote&s;t and in&s;trument, with John Harper, his mate, and Jo&s;eph Henry, and An|drew
