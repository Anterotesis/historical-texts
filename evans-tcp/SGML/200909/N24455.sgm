Gomez, Lopez and Rivera; that object, &s;o e&s;&s;ential to me, ought not to be encumbered with any difficulty. I ob&s;erve, however, and &s;ee it with pain, that we do not agree on the means and precautions to be taken. I pre&s;ume that it is for want of under&s;tanding one another, being unfortunate enough not to &s;peak your langauge, and an interpreter not being able to expre&s;s the true meaning of a phra&s;e which perhaps he does not under&s;tand perfectly. But this bu&s;ine&s;s being extremely important to me, and until we can agree upon this point, it is my wi&s;h, and I de&s;ire, 1&s;t. That you in&s;i&s;t on the conditions of the deed of &s;ale, which relate to the in&s;urance being performed, and require that the amount of the &s;ale be entirely covered as well as the premium, that in all ca&s;es, the recovery of the in&s;urance be &s;ufficient for the payment of what is due to me. 2d. That you do not give any order for the di&s;po&s;al of the proceeds of this &s;hipment without my knowledge and con&s;ent, that I may, if I think proper, avail my&s;elf of the fourth article of the contract, to receive the money in France or Ham|burgh; and that we may come to a determination on this &s;ubject, be &s;o obliging as to point out, and let me know the hour and place at which we may meet. I &s;hall pro|vide an interpreter, to avoid any lo&s;s of time.</P>

<P>I had the honour on the 29th of la&s;t month to reque&s;t of your I&s;aac Gouverneur, on behalf of your hou&s;e as my agents, that the Hamburgh ve&s;&s;el the White Fox, capt. Van Berend Edward Haber&s;trok, might not depart till the in&s;urance to be made, pur&s;uant to the contract with Me&s;&s;rs. Gomez, Lopez and Rivera, was entirely com|pleted as we had agreed, nor before the requi&s;ite di&s;po&s;i|tions were made to &s;ecure the application of the proceeds of the cargo of cotton and indigo &s;old them on my ac|count to the payment of what was due to me; having elected as I had a right to do, to receive the amount at one of the ports of di&s;charge. Towards this end, I re|que&s;ted that my account with you might be prepared, in order to be adju&s;ted, and that I might be enabled by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the notes or &s;ome competent authorization, and an authenticated copy of the contract of &s;ale, to re|ceive the &s;um which was coming to me out of the pro|ceeds
<PB N="26" REF="032369_0025_0FF1FA8F057B8C98">
of the cargo&mdash;and informed him that it was my in|tention, thus provided and enabled to go in per&s;on to Eu|rope, to attend the progre&s;s of the affair and receive the payment to which I was entitled, that I had accordingly engaged a fa&s;t &s;ailing ve&s;&s;el to carry me, and that the ne|ce&s;&s;ary arrangements being made, I &s;hould depart the third or fourth in&s;tant, to give my per&s;onal attention to the cour&s;e of an affair of primary importance to me, and thereby perhaps prevent any di&s;a&s;trous con&s;equences which might otherwi&s;e ari&s;e. The&s;e de&s;ires, intentions and expecta|tions were afterwards reiterated by me, but not being met as I could hope, I, on the 30th of May, wrote the letter of which a copy is herewith tran&s;mitted, and to which I received no an&s;wer. To my &s;urpri&s;e, I learnt the next day, that the ve&s;&s;el had &s;ailed, and I am this moment igno|rant that any adequate means have been attempted to &s;e|cure the application of the proceeds of the cargo, accord|ing to the wi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">h which I communicated, and the right re|&s;erved me by the contract, and I remain unfurni&s;hed with any documents or means by which I might take the mea&s;ures that might appear to me advi&s;eable. Even the precaution which I urged of addre&s;&s;ing to the hou&s;e of Le Conteulx and Co. of Rouen, an authen|ticated copy of the contract of &s;ale, to the end that they might take care of my intere&s;t, was at that time refu&s;ed, and as far as I know, has been omitted. To en|crea&s;e the inconvenience of my &s;ituation, I am left with the embara&s;&s;ment of having on my hands the ve&s;&s;el I had hired to convey me to Europe, and may be expo&s;ed to lo&s;s from that &s;ource. In this &s;ituation I am &s;orry to be obli|ged to think that your hou&s;e has failed in ob&s;erving to|wards me a conduct, corre&s;ponding with my rights and in|tered, and I conclude, that it has made it&s;elf re&s;pon&s;ible for whatever lo&s;&s;es may en&s;ue. De&s;irous of obviating, however, as for as may &s;till be po&s;&s;ible, eventual mi&s;for|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters"> to any party, I offer my&s;elf to co-operate with you in concerting without lo&s;s of time, &s;uch mea&s;ures as may <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> practicable to give effect to the operation according to the true intent, and the rights of each party.

<P>We enclo&s;e you herewith an, account &s;ales of the goods that were placed in our hands, which render &pound;54,196,11,10 for their net proceeds. We al&s;o hand you a &s;tatement of our account current, and when we are in the receipt of all the money re&s;ulting from the &s;ales of the&s;e goods and the drawback of the duties, there will be coming to you a ba|lance of &pound; 47544, 15, 6. We further &s;tate, there will be coming to us &pound; 6256, 2, 6, to cover the pre&s;ent advances, &amp;c. be&s;ides which we are re&s;pon&s;ible for the charter of the &s;hip White Fox, in &pound; 3733, 6, 8. on your account. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances we have grounded an objection to give you an authorization to receive the money in France for the &s;ales of the goods, until we are fir&s;t re-em|bur&s;ed and made &s;ecure. We have no objection to co|operate with you for the ultimate &s;ecurity of the property upon fair principles of ju&s;tice and equity. And if you

have &s;eparated your&s;elves from us with a view to entangle or make us in any re&s;pect, liable for the &s;ale to Me&s;&s;rs.

In ju&s;tice to tho&s;e gen|tlemen who have become the purcha&s;ers of the goods, we think proper to ob&s;erve, that they are men of property and fair characters, and that we are di&s;po&s;ed to treat them with a degree of delicacy throughout this unfortunate tran&s;action, which will evidently end in a con&s;iderable lo&s;s, and prove a gro&s;s deception by their not having a competent knowledge in the article of cotton, it would therefore be with reluctance that we &s;hould undertake any thing that might operate to their prejudice or injury. Still we are not unwilling to devote our&s;elves to your in|tere&s;t, nor do we &s;ee any rea&s;on for all the difficulties and anxieties your imagination is apparently troubled with, without &s;u&s;taining any real cau&s;e of alarm.</P>

<P>I received ye&s;terday your letter of the 6th in&s;t. with the accounts mentioned in it, which to my &s;urpri&s;e takes no direct notice of my letter to you of the &s;ame date. I pa&s;s by the &s;ingular in&s;inuation which it contains, and confine my&s;elf to the real bu&s;ine&s;s in que&s;tion between us. I ob&s;erve with regret, that (though you have dropped one of the items which originally compo&s;ed your claim, the premiums of in&s;urance) you per&s;i&s;t in the idea of retain|ing exclu&s;ively in your command and di&s;po&s;ition, the whole of my property on the ground of a lien upon it, ari&s;ing from your agency, which according to your own &s;tate|ment amounts to little more than one fifth of its value, and adhere to your objection, to give me an authorization to receive any part of it. It was ever my intention, and as I conceived imported in my original propo&s;itions, to provide for your payment and &s;ecurity to the extent of your ju&s;t claims, as the condition of the authorization, I demand of you to receive what was rightfully coming to me. This was equally the intention of the co-operation propo&s;ed by my letter of the &s;ixth, and I continue di&s;po&s;ed to enter into that co-operation upon this principle. It is true there are &s;everal items in your account, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> which we differ in opinion; yet I am ready to make &s;uitable re|&s;ervations and arrangements towards a right adju&s;tment of them, but I cannot conceive that this ought to have pre|vented, or ought now to impede precautions and mea&s;ures tending to &s;ecure a due application of the proceeds of the cargo, and to put me in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the funds to which I am indubitably entitled, and according to the election which was re&s;erved for my benefit in the terms of the con|tract. On this ground of putting me in a &s;ituation to po&s;|&s;e&s;s without delay, that to which I am indi&s;putably enti|tled, and of leaving your ju&s;t and legal claims upon the property, and otherwi&s;e, unimpaired, I am &s;till willing
<PB N="34" REF="032369_0033_0FF1FAAD622499C0">
to co-operate. But as I conceive there were preten&s;ions and omi&s;&s;ions in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, which render you re&s;|pon&s;ible for con&s;equences, as it may now be too late to re|pair the deficiency, as every moment's delay increa&s;es the ri&s;ks, I &s;till make the offer of co-operation, on the con|dition of holding you in the &s;ame &s;tate of re&s;pon&s;ibility in which you were prior to that offer. At the &s;ame time it will be explicitly under&s;tood, that in acceding to the co|operation on this condition, you do not incur any new or additional re&s;pon&s;ibility. With this explanation, I urge an immediate and po&s;itive an&s;wer whether you will con|cur in an arrangement on this ba&s;e. Moments are preci|ous. That which might be u&s;eful now, may quickly be|come u&s;ele&s;s by procra&s;tination. The nature of the co|operation will be an after con&s;ideration. The terms to be &s;ettled between us, according to our mutual opinions, and the advice we may mutually take.</P>

Gomez, Lopez and Rivera &s;tipulated to make in&s;urance, but this might be done, as well after, as before the ve&s;&s;el &s;ailed; and if neglected al|together, it would amount to a breach of contract only, for which the ve&s;&s;el could not be detained. With re&s;pect to the premium for in&s;urance paid by us, although we omitted it in our la&s;t account, we do not a&s;&s;ent to the force of your objection to the payment of it. The in&s;urance being effected for your benefit and &s;ecurity, it is more rea&s;onable that you &s;hould run the hazard of
<PB N="35" REF="032369_0034_0FF1FAB14733C000">
recovering back the premium than we, who act only as agents. To remove however every impediment to a &s;ettlement, and manife&s;t a &s;pirit of accommodation, this charge has been for the pre&s;ent dropped. We cannot forbear remarking, that notwith&s;tanding your &s;olicitude to obtain the authorization in que&s;tion, you con&s;tantly uphold a claim upon us for certain con&s;equences, without pointing out in what manner we may have rendered our|&s;elves re&s;pon&s;ible. Although we are not con&s;cious of any act which can give you this claim, and are therefore ea&s;y on this head, yet you cannot but perceive the im|propriety of our admitting, that we have incurred this re&s;pon&s;ibility, which we &s;hould do, were we to come to a &s;ettlement upon the terms propo&s;ed by you. As to our lien on the notes, and other documents relating to this tran&s;action, we never had any doubt of our right to with|hold them, and al&s;o to refu&s;e you any authority to act, until the whole of our demand was &s;atisfied, and we &s;a|tisfactorily &s;ecured again&s;t contingent claims. Indeed as the contract is in our name, and we are bound under a penalty of 20,000 dollars to endor&s;e on the notes, which are al&s;o in our favor, the payments as they are made, we might in&s;i&s;t (were we di&s;po&s;ed as you in&s;inuate to create difficulties) upon all the monies pa&s;&s;ing through our hands, or tho&s;e of an agent cho&s;en by us, and for that purpo&s;e keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every paper until the tran&s;action was finally clo&s;ed. But we are &s;incerely anxious to put an end to a controver&s;y, which did not originate with us; for this purpo&s;e we beg leave to refer you to our letter of the 6th in&s;tant, in which we were &s;o explicit as to the terms upon which we were willing to give you the au|thority you de&s;ire, and to co-operate with you, that no|thing remains to be added. To give you, however, a further proof of our wi&s;h for a &s;peedy and amicable ar|rangement, we are willing, if the&s;e terms are not agree|able to you, to &s;ubmit the whole matter to arbitration.</P>

<P N="1">1&s;t.

<P>I cannot ea&s;ily expre&s;s my chagrin at your reply of the 12th to my letter of the 12th in&s;tant, I had hoped that my propo&s;itions would have appeared to you entirely rea&s;ona|ble,
<PB N="40" REF="032369_0039_0FF1FAC4E959B180">
or at lea&s;t that you would have made me &s;uch others in return of a &s;pecific nature, as you did your&s;elves ap|prove. But in&s;tead of this, you merely refer me to your former propo&s;itions, of which I know not any except a reference to arbitration&mdash;I am obliged therefore to con|clude &s;till more firmly than heretofore, that it is your de|termination at all events to retain my whole property in your di&s;po&s;ition, till the final winding up of the &s;pecula|tion by Me&s;&s;rs.

Thus depriving me of the election which was re|&s;erved by the terms of the contract, to receive the money coming to me in Europe, and di&s;appointing all the mea|&s;ures I had taken and projected on this ba&s;is. I prote&s;t once more again&s;t this mode of proceeding, and all the con&s;equences of it, and I demand for the la&s;t time, that you forthwith furni&s;h me with an authenticated copy of the contract of &s;ale, and with a competent authorization, to receive at the port of di&s;charge, whatever &s;um &s;hall re|main of the proceeds of the goods &s;old on my account to Me&s;&s;rs.

<P>Upon reviewing our late corre&s;pondence, we cannot but think that we have manife&s;ted every di&s;po&s;ition to bring the controver&s;y between us to a &s;peedy and amicable deter|mination. We have offered, and again repeat the propo&s;al, that we will deliver into your hands, all the papers and notes which regard this tran&s;action without delay, upon your giving us &s;atisfactory &s;ecurity in this country; to pay us in a rea&s;onable time our commi&s;&s;ion, and &s;uch &s;ums as we may have di&s;bur&s;ed, or made our&s;elves re&s;pon&s;ible for, on your account, and al&s;o &s;ufficiently &s;ecure us again&s;t the payment of &s;uch &s;ums as we may eventually be called upon by rea&s;on of our interference in this bu&s;ine&s;s. When it is con&s;idered that we have a right to in&s;i&s;t upon immediate payment of the balance of our account, as the condition of our delivering up the&s;e papers, you cannot deem this propo&s;ition unrea&s;onable. We are certainly not obliged to receive payment in France, e&s;pecially at a time when &s;o many difficulties attend getting money from that country, and were we to accede to the terms held out by your favour of this date, we &s;hould be obliged to wait the event of an application for the money to Me&s;s. Gomez, Lopez and Rivera in France, before we could have recour&s;e to you. Much more has already been &s;aid upon this &s;ubject than was nece&s;&s;ary; to conclude, we conceive our&s;elves entitled to keep all the &s;ecurities we have at pre&s;ent, and were we di&s;po&s;ed to be litigious, we might, even now, apply to you in a judicial way for payment of our demand. This being our &s;ituation, we have no he&s;itation in rejecting your offers of this day as inadmi&s;&s;ible.

I confine my&s;elf therefore to demanding of you without delay, an authenticated and certified copy of the contract of &s;ale made with Me&s;s Go|mez, Lopez and Rivera, and to declaring to you, that in

as much as you have by the circum&s;tances which preceded the departure of the cargo, and in addition thereto by re|fu&s;ing to comply with all the propo&s;itions and demands I have made you &s;ince, entirely deranged my plans, and de|prived me of the power of commanding my funds in France, and of all the advantage from the employment of them there, I hold you re&s;pon&s;ible, and &s;hall in&s;i&s;t upon your re&s;pon&s;ibility for all lo&s;&s;es, damages, and di&s;advanta|ges which may en&s;ue, including an indemnification for the derangement of the mea&s;ures I had adopted for proceed|ing in per&s;on to France, to po&s;&s;e&s;s my&s;elf of my pro|perty.</P>

We wanted Mr. Barretto to leave us the certificate to &s;ee if it could be made to an&s;wer that purpo&s;e as it was irregular, but he objected to it before he had &s;een Mr. Cherriot. Since then we have heard nothing further about it&mdash;if it is in your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, it would be well for you to &s;end it to us, and we will &s;ee what may be further needful. We have received from the cu&s;tom hou&s;e, the debenture of duties on your goods which we &s;hall ac|count for&mdash;but we mu&s;t be indemnified for our bonds, or the needful papers mu&s;t be returned to us to procure them cancelled. Directions were given Mr. Gomez for that purpo&s;e re&s;pecting the goods under his care, but the &s;u|gar in que&s;tion he never had any thing to do with. That unfortunate adventure of Mr. Gomez, as we were well aware of, is like to turn to a ruinous account. After waiting &s;ome time at Havre, he has been obliged to ex|po&s;e it <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> further ri&s;ks, and expences by proceeding to Ham|burgh for a market.

<P>WITH your favor of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> in&s;t. I received the cer|tificate which Mr. Gomez has &s;ent you of the landing at Hamburgh of the cotton and indigo per &s;hip White Fox, which not being drawn conformably to the in&s;truc|tions you had given him, has been rejected by the col|lector of the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e. Not being my&s;elf well ac|quainted with the forms pre&s;cribed, and not knowing the in&s;tructions you may have given Mr. Gomez, I cannot judge in what point it is deficient, but I think there is yet time enough to have it corrected; and I return it with this letter, &s;o that you make of it what u&s;e you think fit. The &s;ame letter covered al&s;o copy of a letter from Mr. Gomez to your hou&s;e, dated at Hamburgh the 12th of Augu&s;t; with another copy of a letter which the &s;ame gentleman wrote the &s;ame day to his hou&s;e of Gomez, Lopez and Rivera.

It is one of tho&s;e accidents to which every &s;peculation of that kind is expo&s;ed; and I am yet in hopes that the re&s;ult will not be &s;o unfavour|able as Mr. Gomez &s;eems to apprehend, by the &s;tart of the price of cotton in the London market, and a little patience. However the bu&s;ine&s;s may turn out, I &s;hould hope that you have taken every precaution to in&s;ure to your&s;elves the whole amount of the obligations of Me&s;&s;rs.

<P>YOUR favour of this date has been duly received. While we regret the great lo&s;s which Me&s;&s;rs.

Gomez, Lopez and Ri|vera, as the intere&s;t of all parties naturally pointed out, and under this impre&s;&s;ion addre&s;&s;ed you on the 7th and 8th in&s;tant. Your an&s;wer &s;atisfies us that you have no other object in view, than to induce us to take &s;ome &s;teps that may place us in a &s;ituation of re&s;pon&s;ibility, which we do not think proper to incur. As to our having already ren|dered our&s;elves an&s;werable for the amount of the &s;ales, we do not believe you &s;incerely entertain the idea your&s;elf. The only definite terms upon which you ever demanded the authorization, which is made the pretext of a mi&s;un|der&s;tanding between us, and which are contained in your letter of the 12th June, are &s;uch as we conceived our&s;elves warranted in rejecting at that time, and have had no rea&s;on to change our opinion. The rea&s;ons which influ|enced us have already been detailed and are too obvious to require repetition. To di&s;cu&s;s this point further will nei|ther be plea&s;ant nor u&s;eful. We are prepared to meet the que&s;tion in any &s;hape you may choo&s;e to bring it forward, in full confidence of having di&s;charged our tru&s;t with in|tegrity, and every proper attention to your intere&s;t, and a perfect reliance on tho&s;e tribunals which mu&s;t ultimately decide between us. Under a conviction however, that it is your wi&s;h that we may a&s;&s;ume a di&s;cretion which may eventually render us liable, we think proper to inform you that we &s;hall not empower any hou&s;e in Europe to receive any payment on the notes we hold, without an expre&s;s au|thority from you in writing for that purpo&s;e.

<P>I have been favoured with your letter of the 23d in&s;t. therewith enclo&s;ed a copy of that one of the 22d in&s;t, you write to Me&s;&s;rs.

I do accept the propo&s;al, concerning the depo&s;it, as the only let in my power, and referring to my letter of the 19th in&s;tant, that as you are unwilling to divide the depo&s;it between two hou&s;es, I con&s;ent it be laid into the hand, of Me&s;&s;rs. Lubbert and Dumas, as the depo&s;it is at my ri&s;k, I expect it &s;hall not be di&s;po&s;ed of, in any ca&s;e

<P>I confirm to you my la&s;t of 26th in&s;t. to which I have not been favoured with any an&s;wer. Having been in|formed &s;ince by Me&s;&s;rs. Lopez and Rivera, that Mr. Gomez, their co-partner, was at London taking &s;ome mea&s;ures to get there the cargo of cotton and indigo, I fear the powers tran&s;mitted to Me&s;&s;rs. Lubbert and Du|mas of Hamburgh, will not effect the de&s;ired purpo&s;e. I now reque&s;t of you, gentlemen, you will let me know, whether you have received any information concerning that determination, and whether you meditate any further means for &s;ecuring the proceeds of the cargo, for the benefit of whom&s;oever it may concern.</P>

in&s;tead of Me&s;&s;rs. Lubbert and Dumas of Hamburgh, which is prepared ready for the purpo&s;e, and they will take care to forward it. 'Tis probable from their infor|mation the property will be removed from Hamburgh to London, part of the cotton was actually on its way. They will therefore pur&s;ue the nece&s;&s;ary &s;teps to touch as much of the money as can be done in Europe, not doubting of his approbation.</P>

<P>I have received your note of the 2d in&s;tant. The prin|cipal aim of the enquiry was to a&s;certain what your note verifies. Though I will not di&s;approve of any mea&s;ures you may take to &s;ecure the proceeds of the cargo for whom&s;oever it may concern; yet it mu&s;t be under&s;tood, that I a&s;&s;ume no &s;pecial ri&s;k upon the &s;ubject, and that I look more and more to your eventual re&s;pon&s;ibility. The going with the cargo from the port of di&s;charge at Hamburgh, to London, changes e&s;&s;entially the nature and effect of the contract.</P>

<P>And the jurors afore&s;aid, upon the oath afore&s;aid, do further find, That by the cu&s;tom of Normandy, in which province the port of Havre de Grace is &s;ituated, the ven|dor of a cargo of goods and merchandizes has a priviledge or lien upon the &s;aid cargo, for the price of it until it is &s;old by the purcha&s;er, and actually delivered to another per&s;on. And that in con&s;equence of &s;uch lien, or privi|ledge, &s;uch vender, if he thinks him&s;elf in danger of lo&s;|ing his &s;ecurity, may apply to the con&s;ular tribunals for redre&s;s, and that &s;uch tribunals, proceeding upon princi|ples of equity and good con&s;cience, would interpo&s;e to prevent the removal of &s;uch cargo by the purcha&s;er to another place, unle&s;s upon good &s;ecurity being given to the vendor it appeared that it would thereby be &s;ubject|ed to great danger or deterioration, and this, even if there was a clau&s;e in the contract of &s;ale allowing the going to another port; but that in the la&s;t ca&s;e very &s;trong proof would be required that the purcha&s;er was in real danger of &s;uffering by the removal.</P>

<P>And the jurors afore&s;aid, upon their oath afore&s;aid, do further, find That in the month of June, one thou&s;and &s;e|ven hundred and ninety-five, a demand was made by the plaintiff of the defendants, for an authorization to receive from the &s;aid Gomez. Lopez and Rivera, agreeably to the terms of the contract afore&s;aid, at the port in Europe where the &s;aid &s;hip White Fox &s;hould di&s;charge her &s;aid cargo of cotton and indigo, &s;uch &s;um or &s;ums of money as &s;hould be due to the plaintiff on account of the &s;ame, after deducting therefrom and leaving &s;ubject to the con|troul of the defendants, a &s;um &s;ufficient to re-embur&s;e them for the balance due the defendants on adju&s;tment of their accounts, and al&s;o a &s;ufficient &s;um to indemnify the defendants again&s;t all engagements they had entered into an account of the plaintiff in the cour&s;e of their &s;aid agen|cy, with which demand the defendants refu&s;ed to comply.</P>
