<HEAD>SOME NECESSARY REMARKS ON THE EDUCATION OF THE YOUTH <HI>in the</HI> COUNTRY-PARTS <HI>of this, and the neighbouring</HI> GOVERNMENTS.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the religious and civil education of our young people is an affair of the great|e&s;t importance, as it not only concerns the hap|pine&s;s of individuals, but the welfare and pro|&s;perity of Society, all are ready to acknowledge; but when we ca&s;t our eyes over the country and con&s;ider the little attention and pains employed therein, we mu&s;t allow that people either do

not &s;peak as they think, or that what they mean by education, is &s;omething el&s;e than to qualify their children to be u&s;eful and &s;ervice|able in life; and to fit them for eternal happi|ne&s;s. If the boy be de&s;igned for any of the learned profe&s;&s;ions, inquiry is made for a ma|&s;ter to teach him Latin; but if he be only de|&s;igned for the common offices of life, it is thought &s;ufficient that he be taught to read and write, with a little arithmetick, and that often but very imperfectly; no matter by whom, but the cheaper the better. Thus it happens that per&s;ons, every way, unqualified, both in learning and morals, are, for the &s;ake of hav|ing it done cheaper, entru&s;ted with the educa|tion of children; by which means, the youth are deprived of learning, and in&s;tead of im|proving in virtue, which ought to be the main de&s;ign of in&s;truction, rather become proficients in vice. For, it is an undoubted truth, con|firmed by fatal experience, that children catch the vices of tho&s;e with whom they conver&s;e, and that impre&s;&s;ions made on their tender minds are deep and la&s;ting. The love we owe to God our great and good Creator, good will to men, a &s;trict regard to truth; a government of their appetites and pa&s;&s;ions, &s;hould be, as much as po&s;&s;ible, enforced on the youth <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The chief aim of in&s;truction pointed out by the Go&s;pel and enforced by the wi&s;e men of every age and nation was the amendment of the heart: The Lacedemonians and Per&s;ians accounted ingratitude a crime, whoever was ever capable of forgetting a benefit was looked upon as the enemy of mankind.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="015739_0003_0F9A2347AD78ABB8">If we really wi&s;h to &s;ee our children grow up in virtue and knowledge, and qualified to be u&s;eful members of Society, the means mu&s;t be procured, to which it is to be hoped, that tho&s;e who have not, as well as tho&s;e who have children, would cheerfully contribute, without regard to any immediate advantage, they are to reap; virtuous per&s;ons qualified for &s;o weigh|ty an employment mu&s;t be &s;ought for: And in order that this may be done upon a la&s;ting bottom, where the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a School is nece&s;&s;ary, a fund &s;hould be rai&s;ed, which thro' the divine ble&s;&s;ing, by donations, legacies, &amp;c. may become a la&s;ting &s;ettlement; a lot of ground &s;hould be provided, &s;ufficient for a garden, orch|ard, gra&s;s for a cow, &amp;c. a hou&s;e, &s;tables, &amp;c. erected thereon: There are few neighbour|hoods, but may, in money from the rich, and materials and labour from others, contribute &s;o much as will an&s;wer this charge; &s;uch a &s;ettle|ment, with a rea&s;onable Salary, will be an en|couragement to a &s;ober per&s;on, with a family, who will be likely to &s;pend his life in the &s;er|vice; &s;uch an one, from the experience he will gain, will be much more likely to an&s;wer the good end propo&s;ed, than &s;uch tran&s;ient per&s;ons as are often employed. Indeed the illjudged cu&s;tom which has generally prevailed with the country people, of hiring a &s;ingle per&s;on, on account of cheapne&s;s, and for the &s;ake of board|ing him, among&s;t them&s;elves, is attended with many inconveniences. The&s;e are frequently per&s;ons of no &s;tability, and little principle, who engage in that &s;ervice, for a pre&s;ent mainten|ance,
<PB N="4" REF="015739_0004_0F9A23486EDF7B30">
which they are ready to quit, when ever &s;omething more agreeable to their intere&s;t or humour offers; &s;o that, they have as little de&s;ire as opportunity, of gaining that nece&s;&s;ary ex|perience, which, nothing will &s;o effectually give, as a &s;erious and &s;teady practice.</P>
<P>It is a mo&s;t ab&s;urd piece of thrift, for the &s;ake of adding 40, or 50 pounds to a child's fortune, to deprive him of the benefit of a pro|per education, for only to con&s;ider it in the light of prudence, the child, if well in&s;tructed, will readily &s;ave or gain that much more; and, if taught wherein true happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts, he will never repine at the want of that &s;mall &s;um; but to a per&s;on unprincipled in virtue, or cor|rupted with evil habits, what is 40 or 50 pounds more or le&s;s? Nay, does not daily experience &s;hew us that the greate&s;t wealth often an&s;wers little or no other purpo&s;e, than to admin&s;ter to folly, luxury, and debauchery; to inflame the pa&s;&s;ions of the youth, and give a wider range to their licentiou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>And, in order that this nece&s;&s;ary &s;ervice &s;hould be managed to the be&s;t advantage, a number of per&s;ons the be&s;t qualified, and able to attend the &s;ervice, &s;hould be cho&s;en, to take upon them the care and over&s;ight of the School; to advi&s;e and a&s;&s;i&s;t the ma&s;ter; and to be e&s;pecially careful, that the children of the poor be encouraged to attend, and be admitted, free of co&s;t. And the ma&s;ters and over&s;eers are exhorted, and en|treated, not to repine or grudge any labour they may be&s;tow in this good &s;ervice, beyond what has been u&s;ual; but remember, they are promoting the purpo&s;es of our good Creator, who&s;e will is the happine&s;s of his creatures, who is able and willing to repay even a cup of cold water given in his name; and the comfort it will
<PB N="5" REF="015739_0005_0F9A23492FCD3690">
in future afford them to reflect, that they have in &s;ome mea&s;ure, been the happy in&s;truments in laying the foun|dation for making the youth &s;erviceable and happy here, and of promoting their eternal happine&s;s hereafter.</P>
<P>The following advices are &s;ubmitted to the con&s;idera|tion of tho&s;e over&s;eers and Tutors who may be ap|pointed to the care of &s;uch Schools.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. That in teaching Engli&s;h, particular care &s;hould be taken to make children &s;pell correctly, by exerci&s;|ing them, frequently, in that nece&s;&s;ary branch of their learning.</P>
<P N="2">2d. That endeavours be u&s;ed to make the Scholars read with proper empha&s;is and punctuation, to which purpo&s;e it will be al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary, be&s;ides the Bible to make u&s;e of Hi&s;torical and Religious Authors, of which the School ought to be furni&s;hed with proper &s;etts.</P>
<P N="3">3d. That &s;uch parts of Grammer as are applicable to the Engli&s;h tongue, be taught tho&s;e boys who are fit for it, in order to make them write properly, but that they be as little as po&s;&s;ible, perplexed with &s;uch nice di&s;tinctions, as have no foundation in the nature of our language.</P>
<P N="4">4th. That the Ma&s;ter as often as is convenient make a practice of dictating, to &s;uch Scholars who write tolerably well, &s;ome &s;entence out of &s;ome good Author which they are to write after him; then the Ma&s;ter carefully correct it, making &s;uch Grammatick and Orthographic remarks as are nece&s;&s;ary: This the Scholar mu&s;t write over in his Book, which being again reviewed by the Ma&s;ter and the remaining omi&s;|&s;ions noted, may be copied in the neate&s;t manner on the oppo&s;ite page. Some modern Grammarians al&s;o pro|po&s;e, that the Tutors give their &s;cholars &s;ome portion of Hi&s;tory, &amp;c. expre&s;&s;ed in fal&s;e Orthography, Gram|mar, &amp;c. which they with the help of a Dictionary and &s;ome general Grammatic Rules mu&s;t make out as cor|rect as they can, which after being &s;ubmitted to the Tutor's Remarks and Correction, &s;hould be neatly copied over in their writing Books. The&s;e methods if carefully pur&s;ued will much help their diction; improve
<PB N="6" REF="015739_0006_0F9A2349EDAC0C10">
their &s;pelling; teach them to copy correctly; and in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;upply the want of Cla&s;&s;ical Learning</P>
<P N="5">5th. That in writing care be taken to promote a &s;trong free hand, which will be of mo&s;t common u&s;e, and from which all other hands may be ea&s;ily formed. And that the Ma&s;ter be particularly careful to make the pu|pils &s;it in right po&s;itions at their writing and that they hold their pen properly, on this their perfection in writing very much depends.</P>
<P N="6">6th. That in teaching Arithmetick it be recommend|ed to the ma&s;ter to give in the fir&s;t place the mo&s;t plain and practical rules; leaving tho&s;e that are ab&s;truce and not generally nece&s;&s;ary, to boys of the brighte&s;t genius, or lei&s;ure.</P>
<P N="7">7th. That a &s;mall, but very plain &s;et of Merchants Accompt Books, <HI>viz.</HI> a Day Book, or Journal and Ledger be provided, ju&s;t &s;ufficient to make the Scholars acquainted with the nature of the mo&s;t plain entries of Debtor and Creditor; that they not only be made to copy the&s;e, in a neat and correct manner, but that the ma&s;ter u&s;e his be&s;t endeavours that they be made to un|der&s;tand the rea&s;on of what they are doing.</P>
<P N="8">8th. That no latin be attempted to be taught, unle&s;s a School &s;hould be erected &s;olety for that purpo&s;e: The teaching that language, in an Engli&s;h School, infallibly con&s;uming more of the ma&s;ters time, than can be &s;pared from his other bu&s;ine&s;s; and the few Latin-Scholars mu&s;t be very indifferently attended</P>
<P N="9">9th. That &s;ome method be thought of for limiting the number of &s;cholars, &s;o that the ma&s;ter be not over-pre&s;t, in &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons of the year; and that the poor be properly con&s;idered.</P>
<P>That &s;uch Rules, or Orders as may be thought ne|ce&s;&s;ary, be provided and &s;et up in &s;ome public place in the School; and that the ma&s;ter be enjoined to require &s;trict obedience to every one of them.</P>
<P>The following Rules of conduct to &s;cholars extracted, from tho&s;e u&s;ed in &s;ome of the &s;chools in Philadelphia, are propo&s;ed to the con&s;ideration of over&s;eers, and tu|tors, to be improved and added to, as their experience and &s;ituation may make nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="7" REF="015739_0007_0F9A234C07198910">1&s;t. Fail not to be at &s;chool preci&s;ely at the time appointed; unle&s;s good rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned to the ma&s;ter.</P>
<P N="2">2d. Be always &s;ilent at your &s;tudies, &s;o that your voices be not heard, unle&s;s when &s;aying your le&s;&s;ons, or &s;peaking to your ma&s;ter: Hold no di&s;cour&s;e with your &s;chool-fellows, during the time of &s;tudy, unle&s;s to a&s;k &s;omething relating to your learning and then in a low voice.</P>
<P N="3">3d. Make all your &s;peeches to your ma&s;ter with due re&s;pect; ob&s;erving cheerfully his directions, according to your abilities.</P>
<P N="4">4th. Behave your&s;elves always in a gentle, obliging manner, to your &s;chool-fellows; tenderly affectionate, never provoking one another; contending nor complain|ing about frivolous matters; but courteou&s;ly u&s;e kind expre&s;&s;ions one towards the other; ob&s;erving to make &s;ome grateful return for any little kindne&s;s received.</P>
<P N="5">5th. Be not forward to divulge any thing pa&s;&s;ed in &s;chool, nor to mock, or jeer your &s;chool fellows for being corrected; it is unkind, and may happen to be your own ca&s;e.</P>
<P N="6">6th. Never tell a lie, or u&s;e artful eva&s;ions, nor de|fraud any per&s;on, by word or deed: Swear not at all; nor u&s;e the name of God irreverently, or in vain: Mock not the aged, the lame, deformed or in&s;ane. Throw no &s;ticks, &s;tones, dirt, &s;nowballs, or any other thing at any per&s;on, or creature: Revile no per&s;on; nor utter any indecent expre&s;&s;ions: Never return any injury or affront; but forgive, agreeable to the po&s;i|tive injunction given us in the Lord's prayer, To for|give as we de&s;ire to be forgiven, and the Apo&s;tle's ad|vice. <HI>That we forgive one another, even as God, for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, has forgiven us;</HI> but in all things to the be&s;t of your power, behave in a mode&s;t, civil, and complai|&s;ant manner to all.</P>
<P>At Home. Before you ri&s;e from your beds, ob&s;erve to look up to your Creator, offering a mental petition to Him for help and protection, during the cour&s;e of the day.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="015739_0008_0F9A234C2DC47228">Ob&s;erve, cheerfully, and readily, to comply with your parent's commands; always addre&s;&s;ing them with ho|nour and re&s;pect, remembering the ble&s;&s;ing annexed, in the third commandment, to the duty of honouring your Parents.</P>
<P>Treat your Brothers and Si&s;ters with affection and good manners; and, in like manner, behave to the mea|ne&s;t Servant; with kindne&s;s u&s;ing the word <HI>plea&s;e,</HI> &amp;c. where proper; that your good example may induce them &s;o to behave to you: Join not in their idle talk or je&s;ting; but choo&s;e the company of per&s;ons, who&s;e con|ver&s;ation is mo&s;t improving in the be&s;t things.</P>
<P>Be not forward to &s;it down at table before your elders; when &s;eated be not eager to fall to your victuals, like the brute bea&s;t; but fir&s;t make a &s;olemn pau&s;e, en|deavouring to retire in your minds, in thankfulne&s;s to the &s;upreme giver of them. Dont offer to carve or a&s;k for your&s;elves, but wait till you are &s;erved; find no fault with your food; but having eaten moderately, ri&s;e from table, without noi&s;e, unle&s;s de&s;ired to &s;tay.</P>
<P>At places of Wor&s;hip, Ob&s;erve to be pre&s;ent at the times appointed, entering the place &s;oberly, &s;o as not to di&s;turb the meditations of tho&s;e that are met: Sit in a decent compo&s;ure of body and mind, putting up your petitions to your heavenly Father, with an humble re|verend di&s;po&s;ition; reque&s;ting to be enabled to offer him &s;piritual and acceptable wor&s;hip. When wor&s;hip is over ri&s;e not up in a hurry, nor be impatient to be gone, but re&s;pectfully pa&s;s along without pre&s;&s;ing, and return decently home.</P>
