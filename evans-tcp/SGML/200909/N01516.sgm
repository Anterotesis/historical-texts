<P><HI>We have &s;inned with our Fathers: We have committed Iniquity, we have done wickedly.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS <HI>P&s;alm</HI> is a <HI>Hi&s;tory,</HI> or rather a <HI>Penitential Confe&s;&s;ion</HI> of the Rebel|lions and Provocations of the <HI>Chil|dren of I&s;rael,</HI> from the day of their Departure out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> thro' all their Travels and long Sojourning in the <HI>Wilderne&s;s.</HI> In the <HI>Text</HI> the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> in the Name of the People of his <HI>own Generation,</HI> confe&s;&s;es their Intere&s;t and &s;hare in the&s;e Sins of <HI>their Fathers and An|ce&s;tors.</HI></P>
<P><HI>We have</HI> Sinned <HI>with our Fathers:</HI> The <HI>Critics</HI> render it by <HI>Sicut</HI> and <HI>aeque;</HI> as expre&s;|&s;ing the <HI>Similitude</HI> of one unto the other, or
<PB N="4" REF="001801_0003_0FB82C62E3C47E80">the <HI>Aggravation</HI> of the one from the other: We have done <HI>as</HI> our Fathers did before us, with <HI>equal</HI> Perver&s;ne&s;s and Rebellion. We have, <HI>added</HI> to the Stock of <HI>Hereditary Guilt,</HI> and fill'd up the Mea&s;ure of their Iniquity. Not only have &s;inned in their <HI>loins,</HI> being the Children and Po&s;terity of wicked Ance&s;tors; but we have been our &s;elves a di&s;obedient, Impenitent, and &s;ometimes <HI>Idolatrous</HI> People, after the <HI>Similitude</HI> of their Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions. We have &s;inned <HI>like</HI> them, by who&s;e <HI>Example,</HI> Sins and Sufferings we &s;hould have <HI>taken War|ning.</HI></P>
<P>THIS &s;eems to be the Meaning of the <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion</HI> in the <HI>Text,</HI> and &s;o they <HI>Aggravate</HI> on their own Iniquities in deep Humiliation, by <HI>calling to Remembrance</HI> the Sins of their An|ce&s;tors.</P>
<P>NOR barely is it the Sins of their <HI>Immedi|ate Progenitors</HI> which they here confe&s;s, but they look back unto the <HI>fir&s;t Times</HI> of their being a free and Di&s;tinct People, as you may &s;ee at large thro' the <HI>P&s;alm.</HI></P>
<P>MOREOVER, I would ob&s;erve the <HI>Repe|tition</HI> of the Confe&s;&s;ion; which is <HI>doubled</HI> and <HI>trebled,</HI> to expre&s;s the <HI>mighty Sen&s;e</HI> they had of the <HI>Greatne&s;s</HI> of their own Guilt: <HI>We have &s;in|ned with our Fathers, we have committed Iniquity, we have done wickedly.</HI> The <HI>&s;ame thing</HI> is repea|ted
<PB N="5" REF="001801_0004_0FB82C6464F906E0"><HI>over and over</HI> in other words: Yet here is no <HI>Tautologie</HI> or <HI>vain Repetition:</HI> But out of the <HI>Abundance</HI> of the heart the Mouth <HI>pours out</HI> its Confe&s;&s;ions: the more to expre&s;s the <HI>Reality</HI> and Certainty of the thing, and the Shame and Sorrow <HI>felt</HI> on that account: the more to <HI>affect</HI> them&s;elves with the thing, and to <HI>aggravate</HI> it upon them&s;elves.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Doctrine</HI> I would offer is this.</P>
<P><HI>THAT it becomes the Profe&s;&s;ing People of GOD in their Humiliations and Confe&s;&s;ions of their own Sins, and the Sins of their own Time and Generation, to remember mention and bewail al&s;o the Sins of their FATHERS and AN|CESTORS, even in Times long &s;ince pa&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>THAT we &s;hould mourn for our <HI>own Per|&s;onal Guilts</HI> in the fir&s;t place, you will ea&s;ily Acknowledge: <HI>the&s;e</HI> &s;hould ever lye <HI>neare&s;t</HI> to and <HI>heavie&s;t</HI> upon our Hearts. Jer. 8.6. <HI>I hear|kened and heard, but they &s;pake not aright, no man repented him of HIS Wickedne&s;s, &s;aying, What have I done?</HI></P>
<P>BUT we mu&s;t mourn for the Sins of <HI>Others</HI> together with our own. Sin ought to grieve us wherever we &s;ee it: P&s;al. 119.158. <HI>I be|held Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors and was grieved.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="001801_0005_0FB82C66576BD598">
IN particular, We &s;hould be <HI>Affected</HI> with and <HI>afflicted</HI> for the Sins of the <HI>Time,</HI> the <HI>Peo|ple</HI> and <HI>Places</HI> wherein our Lot is ca&s;t: Ezek. 9.4. <HI>Go thro' the mid&s;t of the City, and &s;et a Mark on the foreheads of the men that &s;igh and that cry for all the Abominations that be done in the mid&s;t thereof.</HI></P>
<P>BUT it may be the <HI>In&s;tance in the Text</HI> has been <HI>le&s;s tho't of,</HI> than <HI>The&s;e</HI> which I have nam'd: <HI>&s;cil.</HI> That we &s;hould bring into our Humiliations and Confe&s;&s;ions, as the Sins of our People that <HI>now live,</HI> &s;o the Sins of the Generations <HI>before us;</HI> even their Sins who are <HI>long &s;ince dead,</HI> and were &s;o <HI>before we were born.</HI></P>
<P>I will lay before you, 1. The <HI>Demand</HI> of GOD from us to this purpo&s;e, and then 2. Con&s;ider a little the <HI>Rea&s;ons</HI> of it.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>IT is the Will of GOD that we &s;hould re|member and mourn for the Sins of tho&s;e that are gone before us, and who may have been long &s;ince dead, in our penitential and &s;olemn Confe&s;&s;ions.</HI> GOD pre&s;cribes <HI>This</HI> unto <HI>I&s;rael</HI> by the hand of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> in the <HI>After-Confe&s;&s;ions of Future Ge|nerations,</HI> and in particular in the <HI>Captivities</HI> which their Sins would bring upon them: Levit. 26.39, 40. <HI>You &s;hall pine away in your Iniquities in the Land of your Enemies, and in the
<PB N="7" REF="001801_0006_0FB82C68E2371FF0">Iniquity of your Fathers &s;hall ye pine away: If then they &s;hall confe&s;s their Iniquity and the Iniquities of their Fathers,&mdash;then will I remember my Cove|nant.</HI> Now in Obedience to this <HI>Direction</HI> and Command of GOD, the Faithful and <HI>Penitent</HI> in <HI>I&s;rael</HI> did <HI>thus</HI> on every Solemn Occa&s;ion: whereof the <HI>P&s;alm</HI> before us is a copious <HI>In|&s;tance.</HI> More e&s;pecially, toward and after the <HI>Babyloni&s;h Captivity</HI> (to which &s;ome refer the <HI>P&s;alm</HI>) this was the <HI>Burthen</HI> in the Church's Confe&s;&s;ions. So <HI>Jeremiah, Ezra</HI> and <HI>Nehemiah</HI> made their Confe&s;&s;ion in their Day. Jer. 3.25. <HI>We lie down in our Shame, and our Confu&s;ion covers us, for we have &s;inned again&s;t the LORD our GOD, we and our FATHERS from our Youth.</HI> Lam. 5.7. <HI>Our Fathers have &s;inned and are not, and we have born their Iniquities.</HI> Ezra 9.7. <HI>Since the days of our Fathers have we been in great Tre&s;pa&s;s unto this day.</HI> Nehem. 1.6, 7. <HI>Both I and my Fathers hou&s;e have &s;inned: We have dealt very corruptly before thee.</HI> More e&s;pecially in the <HI>Ninth Chapter</HI> we have a large Account of a <HI>Day of Prayer</HI> &s;olemnized by <HI>Nehemiah</HI> and the <HI>Remnant of Judah,</HI> the very De&s;ign of which <HI>Solemn Day</HI> is thus declared, <HI>v. 2. The &s;eed of I&s;rael&mdash;&s;tood and confe&s;&s;ed their Sins, and the Iniquities of their FATHERS.</HI> They were in|deed then <HI>&s;marting</HI> for borh together, and could not well <HI>&s;eparate</HI> them <HI>v.</HI> 16. <HI>But they</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="001801_0007_0FB82C6D06ED0688">even <HI>our Fathers dealt proudly, and hardned their Necks, and hearkened not to thy Commandments,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>v.</HI> 34. <HI>Neither have our Kings, our Princes, our Prie&s;ts, nor our Fathers kept thy Law.</HI></P>
<P>THUS the <HI>Practice</HI> is E&s;tabli&s;h'd in <HI>Scrip|ture,</HI> by Precept and by Example. We find the holy Men of GOD, under the <HI>In&s;piration</HI> of the HOLY GHOST, and the &s;pecial <HI>Influ|ence</HI> of his Grace, bringing the Sins of their <HI>Ance&s;tors</HI> and of the <HI>Generations</HI> before them, into their <HI>Confe&s;&s;ions</HI> before GOD; as well in their <HI>private</HI> as in their more <HI>public</HI> Humilia|tions.</P>
<P>And now,</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>I will Enquire into the Rea&s;ons of this Duty.</HI> It may &s;eem liable to <HI>two Objections,</HI> which I wou'd <HI>premi&s;e</HI> two Words to <HI>Obviate.</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. As if it imply'd <HI>want of Reverence</HI> to our Ance&s;tors,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>Irreverence toward GOD.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IT implies no want of Reverence to our An|ce&s;tors:</HI> Nor is it to be charged with the Spi|rit of <HI>gracele&s;s Ham,</HI> who was condemned for <HI>not covering his Fathers Nakedne&s;s.</HI> We <HI>cannot uncover</HI> the Shame of our Fathers before GOD, to who&s;e Eye all things are <HI>naked and open.</HI> Or if we remember <HI>them</HI> with <HI>Aba&s;ement</HI> be|fore GOD, as well as pro&s;trate our &s;elves in the Du&s;t, it is before <HI>our FATHER in Heaven,</HI> that His Name and Holine&s;s may be <HI>glorified:</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="001801_0008_0FB82C6FCBC9D280">Who&s;e Honour &s;hould be infinitly <HI>dearer</HI> to us than the Name of all <HI>Earthly Parents:</HI> And like <HI>Levi</HI> we mu&s;t be ready to &s;ay unto <HI>Father and Mother</HI> in His Cau&s;e, <HI>I have not &s;een them;</HI> Neither may we <HI>Acknowledge our Brethren, nor know our own Children.</HI> Deut. 33.9.</P>
<P>On the other hand,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>IT is far from implying any Irreverence to|ward GOD, as if He puni&s;h'd us for our Father's Sins.</HI> Far be it from us to take up the <HI>fooli&s;h and prophane Proverb</HI> which was &s;ometimes u&s;ed by the wicked <HI>I&s;raelites:</HI> Ezek. 18.2. <HI>The Fa|thers have eaten the &s;our Grapes, and the Childrens Teeth are &s;et on Edge.</HI> No: What I am arguing for is ju&s;t the <HI>Rever&s;e</HI> of this <HI>Bla&s;phemy.</HI> For <HI>they</HI> make an <HI>Objection</HI> of it again&s;t the Ju&s;tice of Providence, <HI>we</HI> on the contrary confe&s;s its <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> herein: <HI>They</HI> make a <HI>fleer and je&s;t</HI> of it as an Ab&s;urdity, <HI>we</HI> in &s;olemn manner <HI>Adore</HI> the Soverain GOD in his Di&s;pen&s;ation, and <HI>Aba&s;e</HI> our &s;elves before Him In profound Humiliation: <HI>They reflect</HI> upon the Divine Government, <HI>we ju&s;tify</HI> His Admini&s;tration, and own there is no Hard&s;hip done us: for that we know that we &s;hall <HI>never</HI> be puni&s;hed for our <HI>Fathers</HI> Sins if we do not walk in <HI>their Steps;</HI> and then too only in <HI>Temporal Calami|ties</HI> (not in the <HI>Eternal State</HI>) wherein GOD will at la&s;t have puni&s;h'd us <HI>le&s;s when our own Iniquities have de&s;erved.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="001801_0009_0FB82C72DB51AED0">
HAVING <HI>premis'd the&s;e two things</HI> for the guarding and &s;tating the <HI>Truth</HI> before us, I &s;hall now offer two or three more <HI>direct Rea|&s;ons,</HI> Why we &s;hould confe&s;s the Iniquity of our FATHERS together with our <HI>Own</HI> in our Solemn Humiliations.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>TO repair the more if it were po&s;&s;ible the Di&s;honour done unto the Name of GOD and His holy Law.</HI> For all the <HI>Reparation</HI> which we can make being only in the <HI>Explicit Humilia|tions</HI> of our Souls on that Account, we do ren|der the <HI>greater Glory</HI> to the Name of GOD while in our Confe&s;&s;ions we do look back to the Sins of our <HI>Ance&s;tors,</HI> as well as Recollect our <HI>Own.</HI> I am &s;ure among <HI>Men</HI> it wou'd be Accounted a very <HI>worthy Action,</HI> if our Parents had done any Injury to a Nei'bour, if We af|ter their Death &s;hould do what we can, and what appears ju&s;t to us to do them right: And doubtle&s;s the <HI>Great GOD</HI> will accept &s;uch an Act of Piety and Duty from us toward Him&s;elf.</P>
<P>SHOULD it be <HI>our Grief</HI> that our Fathers &s;inned again&s;t GOD, and &s;hould we not <HI>&s;ay &s;o</HI> before Him? What better <HI>Reverence</HI> can we &s;how unto our Father in Heaven? while we <HI>go backward like the blu&s;hing Sons of Noah, drawing a Covering over our earthly Parents Na|kedne&s;s.</HI> Which tho' we wont <HI>look upon,</HI> yet
<PB N="11" REF="001801_0010_0FB82C7686072AC8">we know with Concern that it <HI>lies Expo&s;ed.</HI> To <HI>whom</HI> do we publi&s;h it? to GOD! and <HI>why?</HI> but that HE may be Glorified! Where then is the Tre&s;pa&s;s on <HI>Filial Piety</HI> by this Act of Devotion and Wor&s;hip? or did it bear har|der on the <HI>Names of the Deceas'd,</HI> yet what were <HI>the&s;e</HI> to the Honour of the ETERNAL GOD?</P>
<P>IN confe&s;&s;ing the Sins of our Fathers we <HI>Adore the GOD of our Fathers;</HI> and in Effect we do but <HI>give Him the Glory of that Relation:</HI> Our Fathers GOD and <HI>we will Exalt thee:</HI> &s;on we do as truly <HI>Exalt</HI> GOD in our Penitent Confe&s;&s;ions, as in our Thankful Prai&s;es. Ezra 10.10, 11. <HI>Ye have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed&mdash;Now there|fore make Confe&s;&s;ion unto the LORD GOD of your Fathers.</HI> Can we remember Him as our Fa|thers GOD in our Confe&s;&s;ions, and never bring our Fathers Sins into our Confe&s;&s;ions? Where then is his <HI>Honour,</HI> and where is his <HI>Fear, as</HI> the Lord GOD of our Fathers?</P>
<P N="2">2. IT becomes us to Confe&s;s the Sins of our Fathers with our Own, <HI>to &s;how our Impar|tiality in the hatred of Sin:</HI> that we grieve and mourn for it <HI>becau&s;e it is Sin,</HI> Contrary to GOD and abhorred by Him, <HI>without any Re&s;pect of Per&s;ons.</HI> For <HI>Sin</HI> is the &s;ame in it &s;elf, and the &s;ame in the Sight of GOD, whoever be the <HI>Sinner;</HI> and therefore it is equally to be re|&s;ented
<PB N="12" REF="001801_0011_0FB82C77E1C0C710">by us, as again&s;t GOD. P&s;al. 139. <HI>ult. Am I not grieved with them that ri&s;e up again&s;t thee?</HI> This is a &s;incere and upright <HI>Dete&s;tation</HI> of Sin, as &s;uch.</P>
<P>SOME can freely eno' <HI>fault</HI> Sin in tho&s;e that are <HI>not related</HI> to them; but O how they <HI>cover</HI> and palliate it when it falls out in their <HI>own Hou&s;e?</HI> This brings the mo&s;t declared Zeal again&s;t Sin under a ju&s;t <HI>Su&s;picion</HI> in any One; while it turns to another for a <HI>Te&s;timony</HI> of their Impartial Regard to the Honour of GOD, when they are not brib'd by their Re|lation unto any to ju&s;tify them in Sin.</P>
<P N="3">3. IT is but ju&s;t for <HI>a wicked Po&s;terity</HI> to joyn the Sins of their <HI>Ance&s;tors</HI> with their own in their Confe&s;&s;ions, <HI>becau&s;e they are actually Partakers with them in their Iniquity.</HI> Indeed <HI>this</HI> is too much the <HI>Cour&s;e</HI> of this World in the &s;everal Generations of it, <HI>Po&s;terity learn and retain the Vices of their Ance&s;tors.</HI> As <HI>one Generation</HI> corrupt them&s;elves it is a pretty &s;ure way to make the <HI>Next</HI> wor&s;e. A People are hardly bro't to <HI>reform</HI> the Errors of their <HI>Predece&s;&s;ors,</HI> which they are <HI>Educated</HI> in, and &s;uck in with their <HI>Mothers Milk.</HI> So <HI>I&s;raels Apo&s;tacy grew</HI> on the &s;ucceeding Generations after the Death of <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> and again after the Reigns of <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Solomon.</HI> Judg. 2.10, 19. <HI>There aro&s;e another Generation which knew not the
<PB N="13" REF="001801_0012_0FB82C7B5CFA3680">LORD;</HI> but the next after them <HI>returned and corrupted them&s;elves more than their-Fathers.</HI> The <HI>Prophet</HI> &s;uppo&s;es it to be &s;ometimes the happy Ca&s;e of particular Per&s;ons, <HI>that the Son &s;eeth all his Fathers Sins which he hath done, and con&s;i|dereth and doeth not the like.</HI> Ezek. 18.14. And GOD forbid that <HI>this</HI> &s;hould not be often <HI>Ex|emplified;</HI> and to GOD be the <HI>Prai&s;e</HI> whene|ver it is &s;o. But the Contrary is u&s;ually the Ca&s;e of a Degenerate People. Po&s;terity <HI>inherit</HI> their Fathers Manners, and are <HI>fix'd</HI> in evil Cu&s;toms by the Practice and Example of An|ce&s;tors, and &s;ometimes may <HI>receive their Errors with Reverence.</HI></P>
<P>NOW if the People of <HI>our Age</HI> retain the Evils of the <HI>la&s;t,</HI> and carry Impiety to a grea|ter Length than it was before our time, have we not made our Fathers Sins <HI>our own</HI> with a witne&s;s? <HI>Truly,</HI> as our <HI>Saviour</HI> &s;aid to the <HI>Jews</HI> in His Time. Luk. 11.48. <HI>Ye bear wit|ne&s;s that ye allow the Deeds of your Fathers.</HI> That is, <HI>They</HI> did by the <HI>Prophets</HI> then, as their <HI>Fa|thers</HI> had done long before; They were <HI>Impe|nitent</HI> and <HI>Ob&s;tinate</HI> in Sin as their Fathers had been under the Mini&s;try of former Prophets; they were of the &s;ame <HI>per&s;ecuting Spirit</HI> that their Fathers had been of: So <HI>their Fathers Sin was Theirs</HI> and both to be confe&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame Breath.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="001801_0013_0FB82C7C66E369F0">
IT was the <HI>folly</HI> of the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> and their <HI>Hypocri&s;y</HI> that they cou'd confe&s;s their Fathers per&s;ecution of the <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>not di&s;cern their own.</HI> It may be the Error may &s;eem <HI>le&s;s</HI> if we confe&s;s our own faults, and not our Ance&s;tors. But that our Confe&s;&s;ions may be perfect we mu&s;t <HI>Omit neither.</HI> As the <HI>Martyr Stephen</HI> made Confe&s;&s;ion for the <HI>Jewi&s;h Rulers,</HI> &s;ince they wou'd not do it for them&s;elves: Act. 7.51. <HI>You &s;tiff-necked and Uncircumci&s;ed in heart and ears, ye do always re&s;i&s;t the HOLY GHOST; As your Fathers did &s;o do ye: Which of the Prophets have not your Fathers per&s;ecuted? and they have &s;lain them which &s;hewed before of the Coming of that JUST ONE, of whom ye have been now the Be|trayers and Murderers.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. TO Confe&s;s the Sins of our <HI>Fathers</HI> with our own <HI>may be of &s;pecial Influence to keep us from them, or to Convince us of them, and put us the more zealou&s;ly upon the Reforming and Amend|ing them, that the Wrath of GOD may be turned away from us.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>TO keep us from them:</HI> that if we are not fallen into their Sins we may not: for what more Effectual way is there for the <HI>Preven|tion</HI> of Sin than a &s;incere penitential Confe|&s;&s;ion of it; which binds the Soul not to do it 2. Chron. 30. <HI>And be not ye like your Fathers and like your Brethren, which tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t
<PB N="15" REF="001801_0014_0FB82C7DEAD5D9D0">the LORD GOD of your Fathers,&mdash;Now be not ye &s;tiff-necked as your Fathers were.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>OR &s;urely it mu&s;t the more Convince us of and humble us for our own Sins,</HI> if we have &s;in|ned after the <HI>Similitude</HI> of the Sins of our Fa|thers which we confe&s;s. It mu&s;t leave us <HI>Self-judged</HI> and condemned. Our own <HI>Lips</HI> do then fall upon us, and our own <HI>Tongue</HI> ri&s;es in Judgment. The Guilt of a People is greatly Aggravated, and the Offence to GOD ri&s;es exceedingly, when the Sins of Ance&s;tors are retained. A People may not be ready to Ap|prehend this; but GOD will have them Con|vinced of it. Jer. 16.10, 11. <HI>What is our Ini|quity? or what is our Sin that we have commit|ted again&s;t the LORD our GOD?

<P>THE <HI>Venerable Name</HI> of Religion and of the CHURCH is made a <HI>Sham-pretence</HI> for the wor&s;t of <HI>Villanies:</HI> for all <HI>Uncharitablene&s;s</HI> and unnatural <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ion</HI> of the pious and peaceable, for <HI>&s;landers lies and fal&s;hoods,</HI> for <HI>Divi&s;ions hatred and Animo&s;ities,</HI> for <HI>Bribery and Perjury,</HI> for <HI>Di&s;|loyalty</HI> and <HI>Perfidy,</HI> for <HI>Tumults, Mutinies and Rebellions,</HI> for all <HI>Ingratitude</HI> to GOD &amp; <HI>Trea&s;on</HI> again&s;t the KING and our Country.</P>

THE <HI>perilous Times</HI> are come, wherein Men are <HI>Lovers only of their own Selves,</HI> &s;acrificing the <HI>Public</HI> to their own private <HI>Gains and Am|bition, without natural Affection, Truce-breakers, fal&s;e Accu&s;ers, Incontinent, fierce, de&s;pi&s;ers of tho&s;e that are Good; Traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of plea&s;ures more than lovers of GOD, having a form of Godline&s;s,</HI> and multitudes not <HI>that</HI> nei|ther. <HI>From &s;uch turn away,</HI> &s;ays the Holy <HI>Apo&s;tle:</HI> And I pray GOD to <HI>purge</HI> the <HI>Court, Nobility and Magi&s;tracy</HI> of this plague and <HI>lepro&s;y;</HI> and not the <HI>Court</HI> only, but al&s;o the <HI>Church</HI> and the <HI>Clergy,</HI> the <HI>Univer&s;ities</HI> and <HI>Accademies,</HI> as well as the <HI>Camp</HI> and <HI>Fleet;</HI> that the Spirit of <HI>Par|ties</HI> and <HI>Factions</HI> may not increa&s;e unto more <HI>Ungodline&s;s,</HI> and to all <HI>Barbarities.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ah Calamitous Day!</HI> whereinto we are fallen, and into which the Sins of an <HI>Infatuated Age</HI> has bro't us. <HI>Hear this, Ye old Men, and give ear all Ye Inhabitants of the Land!</HI> hath this been in <HI>your days?</HI> or even in the days of <HI>your Fathers? They are a Nation void of Coun&s;el, neither is there any Under&s;tanding in them! as if their Rock had &s;old 'em, and the LORD had &s;hut them up. O that they were wi&s;e, that they under&s;tood this, that they wou'd con&s;ider their latter End!</HI> that at lea&s;t when their <HI>Judge cometh</HI> there may be <HI>&s;ome Faith and Charity</HI> found in the <HI>Land.</HI></P>
<P>AND doubtle&s;s there is <HI>&s;ome</HI> among Profe&s;|&s;ors of every Denomination. But O <HI>how want|ing</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="001801_0030_0FB82CA59FC7B248">among every party of men. However I am very glad that I can do our <HI>United Brethren in Great Britain,</HI> and this <HI>Country</HI> too the Honour and the Ju&s;tice as to &s;ay, That in this time of public <HI>Treacheries, Perjuries, Rebellion</HI> &amp; <HI>Trea&s;on,</HI> not a <HI>dog</HI> can wag his tongue to charge us with <HI>Di&s;loyalty,</HI> Undutifulne&s;s or Di&s;re&s;pect to <HI>Govern|ment,</HI> or want of <HI>Zeal</HI> and <HI>Fidelity</HI> to the PRO|TESTANT SUCCESSION, the peaceful <HI>Reign</HI> of the KING, &amp; the true Intere&s;ts of the Nation as to their <HI>Civil and Religious Rights.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed it is an <HI>Amazing</HI> thing, and one wou'd think Incredible, that any <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> or Mem|ber of the <HI>Church of England</HI> &s;hould be in the <HI>late Rebellions</HI> again&s;t his <HI>pre&s;ent MAJESTY,</HI> to &s;et up a <HI>popi&s;h Pretender</HI> whom they have &s;o often and ju&s;tly <HI>Abjured.</HI> It is as the <HI>right Reve|rend the Bi&s;hops</HI> &s;ay Excellently in their late <HI>pious and loyal Declaration,</HI> <Q>&s;o vile and dete|&s;table a thing as may ju&s;tly make 'em Odi|ous to GOD and man. And at the &s;ame time to pretend a zeal for the Church of <HI>England</HI> is &s;uch an Impo&s;ition on the common Sen&s;e of Mankind, that nothing even in Popery it &s;elf can be more Ab&s;urd: And nothing but an Infatuation from GOD, ju&s;tly infli|cted for our Sins can &s;uffer it to pa&s;s upon the Nation.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Wherefore, in the Name of GOD, tho&s;e <HI>mo&s;t Reverend Per&s;ons</HI> do call upon the Na|tion,
<PB N="32" REF="001801_0031_0FB82CA98B3ED090">in the fir&s;t place to humble them&s;elves before GOD for the Great and crying Sins of the Nation; for that Spirit of Infidelity and Libertini&s;m; of Unthankfulne&s;s for the Mercies of the Go&s;pel; of Formality and Hypocri&s;y, of Strife and Envy, of Hatred and Animo&s;ity, which are &s;o rife in it, and generally the Forerunners of the De&s;tru|ction of any People.</Q></P>
<P>Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD for this <HI>Sea&s;onable and True Te&s;timony</HI> of the&s;e FATHERS in the Church.

<P>I pray GOD that the Day may come when We may no longer <HI>hate to be reformed,</HI> and that the KING may live to be the <HI>Glorious In&s;tru|ment</HI> in the Hand of GOD of our <HI>Reformation</HI> in every Re&s;pect.
