<P>DEAR Brethren, I beg your patient Attention, while I deliver to you the Coun&s;els of GOD from the&s;e Words. &mdash; This <HI>Parable</HI> was deli|ver'd by Chri&s;t to check a Humour, which he fore&s;aw would be too prevalent in &s;ome of his own dear <HI>Servants:</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="005926_0004_10276D5063D17EA0">
And it affords us many u&s;eful <HI>Ob&s;ervations,</HI> which I &s;hall mention in the Order they occur; explaining the Text as I go along.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t OBSERVATION is, That <HI>there is, has been, and always will be, a Mixture of good Seed &amp; had,</HI> of Tares <HI>and</HI> Wheat <HI>in the</HI> vi&s;ible Church <HI>of</HI> Chri&s;t, <HI>till his &s;econd Coming.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a Man which &s;owed good Seed in his Field; But while Men &s;lept, his Enemy come and &s;owed Tares among the Wheat</HI>&mdash; By the <HI>Field</HI> is meant <HI>the World,</HI> as our Saviour explains it, v. 38. In this <HI>Field</HI> Chri&s;t &s;ows <HI>good Seed, i. e.</HI> he gathers a Church out of the <HI>World,</HI> which are called <HI>the Chil|dren of the Kingdome,</HI> v. 38. He &s;eparates a Number to him&s;elf out of the corrupt Ma&s;s of Mankind; effectu|ally calling them by his Word and Spirit, wa&s;hing away their Sins in his mo&s;t precious Blood, and renewing their Natures, and purifying their Hearts, and making them like GOD in Holine&s;s.&mdash;While he was doing this, <HI>an Ene|my, viz.</HI> Satan <HI>came and &s;owed Tares among the Wheat, i. e.</HI> he &s;tirred up <HI>his Children</HI> to join with GOD's People, and to take on them the Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ion, and to put on the Garb of Saints: Hence they are &s;aid to be <HI>among the Wheat;</HI> they were join'd with them in outward Relation; they became vi&s;ible Members, deceiving both them&s;elves and others. &mdash; The former con&s;tituted the <HI>in|vi&s;ible Church;</HI> but both together made up that Society, which is &s;tyled the <HI>Church vi&s;ible:</HI> So that <HI>Tares and Wheat</HI> are ever found together within the Pale of the Church. &mdash;</P>
<P>In all Companies there will be evil Intruders; Satan among the Angels; <HI>Soul</HI> among the Prophets; <HI>Judas</HI> among the Apo&s;tles; <HI>Dames</HI> among the Profe&s;&s;ors.&mdash; The Church in Scripture is compared to a <HI>Net,</HI> which inclo&s;es good Fi&s;h and bad; to a <HI>Floor,</HI> where the good
<PB N="3" REF="005926_0005_10276D51F8CB5E20">
Grain is mixt with the Chaff; and to a <HI>Hou&s;e,</HI> in which there are Ve&s;&s;els of <HI>Gold and Silver,</HI> and others of <HI>Wood and Earth,</HI> and <HI>&s;ome to Honour,</HI> and <HI>&s;ome to Di&s;honour.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mat.</HI> 13.47. and 3.12. 2. <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.20.</NOTE></P>
<P>Oh! how many are there, who are Friends of Chri&s;t in <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion,</HI> &amp; yet Enemies to him in <HI>Affection?</HI> The <HI>vile&s;t</HI> of Creatures do &s;ometimes creep into the <HI>pure&s;t</HI> of Churches: The <HI>wi&s;e</HI> and <HI>fooli&s;h Virgins</HI> are blended together; good and bad Seed are mixt for a while; the Heirs of Salvation, and the Ve&s;&s;els of Wrath may be of one Church, and eat at one Table: <HI>all are not I&s;rael, that are of I&s;rael,</HI> Rom. 9.6.</P>
<P>This is a Mi&s;ery greatly to be bewailed, but cannot be fully remedy'd, till the Judgment Day, when <HI>Sheep</HI> and <HI>Goats,</HI> true and fal&s;e Profe&s;&s;ors will be &s;eparated for ever. &mdash; However in the mean Time, Mini&s;ters and Churches &s;hould be very careful in this Matter; <HI>They &s;hould learn to be more watchful in Admi&s;&s;ions to the Church.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If Men &s;leep, the Devil will &s;ow Tares;</HI> If the Faith|ful be negligent, He will fill the Church with Swarms of Hypocrites; many of which might be kept out, if due Care be u&s;ed.</P>
<P>Is it not too evident even in our Days, that the Doors of the Church have been open'd too wide? Has there not been a great <HI>Remi&s;sne&s;s</HI> in the <HI>Examination</HI> &amp; Tryal of Candidates for Communion? And have not many unfound Members crowded in by this Means? &mdash; and has not the due Exerci&s;e of <HI>Di&s;cipline</HI> been greatly neg|lected, whereby they have continued to infe&s;t the Church? &mdash; The Lord pardon our great Delinquency in this Re&s;pect, and &s;tir us up to be more watchful. &mdash; No <HI>Perils</HI> &s;o great, as tho&s;e occa&s;ion'd by <HI>fal&s;e Brethren:</HI> We think to fill the Church, but we do but fill the Hou&s;e with Thieves; Wicked Men ever prove a
<PB N="4" REF="005926_0006_10276D5386404010">
Trouble. &mdash; a Body made up of this Mixture becomes like a Body overcharged with ill Humours, and truly Sick. &mdash; By <HI>promi&s;cuous Admi&s;&s;ions,</HI> we bring in &s;uch a Mi&s;chief to the Church, as we cannot ea&s;ily get rid of.- What need then of Circum&s;pection in this Matter? &mdash; Yet after all, let the &s;tricte&s;t Care be u&s;ed, there will &s;ome Hypocrites creep in; and GOD permits it for the Church's <HI>Trial,</HI> and the Wicked's <HI>Harding.</HI></P>
<P>The Second OBSERVATION is, that <HI>the good and bad Seed may be &s;o alike as to outward Appearance, that there is no di&s;tingui&s;hing them for a great while.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Tares</HI> did not appear at fir&s;t, but lay concealed, <HI>'till the Blade &s;prung up, and bro't forth Fruit.</HI> v. 26. 'Twas not the <HI>Stalk,</HI> but the <HI>Fruit</HI> that di&s;tingui&s;h'd them. &mdash; It is St. <HI>Jeram's</HI> Ob&s;ervation, that Wheat and Tares in tho&s;e Ea&s;tern Countries, are &s;o much alike in their fir&s;t &s;pringing up, that 'tis exceeding difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h the one from the other: <HI>The Difference</HI> faith he, <HI>between them is either none at all, or wonderful difficult to di&s;cern.</HI>&mdash;They &s;o a&s;&s;ociate and unite them&s;elves with the Corn, as if they were the very &s;ame. And if this be &s;o difficult; how much more &s;o is it to di&s;cern the Difference between <HI>&s;pecial</HI> and <HI>common Grace</HI> in ano|ther. &mdash; There is no Grace, but a Hypocrite may have &s;omething like it; and there is no Duty done by a Chri&s;tian, but an Hypocrite nay out&s;trip him in it.&mdash; So that a very judicious Eye may be led into a Mi&s;take by the near outward Re&s;emblance, &amp; take a <HI>Counterfeit</HI> for a <HI>Reality.</HI></P>
<P>Does GOD by his Spirit prepare Soul for Chri&s;t by working in them as a <HI>Spirit of Bondage,</HI> convincing, wounding and humbling them for Sin? And do not many, that never receive Chri&s;t, partake of the&s;e <HI>Pre|paratives?</HI> Are they not often deeply convinced of, burden'd with, and wounded for Sin? Were not <HI>Pharaoh</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="005926_0007_10276D59A0896C08">
and <HI>Soul,</HI> and <HI>Judas,</HI> and <HI>Felix,</HI> under great Convictions of Sin for a while? And have not many others been un|der great <HI>legal Terrors,</HI> yea greater than many of GOD's People ever felt; and yet re&s;ted upon their old Bottom &s;till?</P>
<P>Doth GOD work Faith in Souls truly convinced and humbled? There is al&s;o a Faith in Hypocrites. The &s;tony Greund Hearers <HI>for a while believe, and in Time of Temptation fall away,</HI> Luk. 8.13. <HI>Then Simon him&s;elf believed al&s;o,</HI> Act. 8.13. <HI>Many of the Rulers believed on him, but they dur&s;t not confe&s;s him,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Joh.</HI> 12.42. 'Tis &s;aid of the hypocritical <HI>Jews,</HI> I&s;ai. 18.2. <HI>They &s;tay'd them&s;elves upon the GOD of I&s;rael.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Doth true Faith work by Love, and fill the Hearts of Believers with vehement Longings and Breathings after Chri&s;t? &mdash; And does not &s;omething of this appear in Hypocrites? Some of this Stamp were &s;o affected with Chri&s;t's Di&s;cour&s;es, as that they cry'd out; <HI>Lord, ever|more give us this Bread,</HI> Joh. 6.34. And 'tis &s;aid <HI>Luk.</HI> 8.40. <HI>The People gladly received him;</HI> they received him with great Affection and Love.</P>
<P>Doth the Spirit of God &s;eal Believers, and fill them with a ble&s;&s;ed A&s;&s;urance of their Intere&s;t in Heaven?&mdash; And have not many Hypocrites a <HI>&s;trong Per&s;wa&s;ion</HI> of this al&s;o? Ho&s;. 8.2. <HI>I&s;rael &s;hall cry unto me, my GOD, we know thee;</HI> and yet <HI>I&s;rael</HI> was in a great Mi&s;take, as appears from the next <HI>Ver&s;e:</HI> and we read what a Stock of <HI>Confidence</HI> &s;ome Self-Deceivers had, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.19, 20. Yea, &s;o high built may this fal&s;e A&s;&s;urance be, as that they may carry it with them to the Judgment Seat of Chri&s;t. Mat. 7.22. <HI>Lord, Lord, have we not prophery'd in thy Name,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Doth the Holy Spirit give Believers a ble&s;&s;ed Preli|bation or Foreta&s;te of the Bli&s;s above, and fill them with a &s;acred Joy? &mdash; What a Re&s;emblance to this doth that

bear, of which we read, <HI>Heb.</HI> 6.4, 5. <HI>They may ta&s;te of the Heavenly Gift, and he made Partakers of the Holy Gho&s;t, and ta&s;te the good Word of GOD, and the Powers of the World to come;</HI> and yet become final Apo&s;tates? And were not the &s;tony Ground Hearers filled <HI>with Joy</HI> in hearing the Word, <HI>Mat.</HI> 13.20. They who &s;hall be ca&s;t into utter Darkne&s;s, may <HI>for a Sea&s;on rejoyce in the Light,</HI> Joh. 5.35.</P>
<P>Do Believers delight in approaching to GOD, &s;o may Hypocrites. <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 58.2.</P>
<P>Do Believers humble them&s;elves for Sin? the <HI>I&s;ra|elites</HI> were oft deep in their Humiliations; <HI>they &s;ought GOD, and return'd and enquired early after GOD. Ahab humbled him&s;elf.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>P&s;alm</HI> 78.34.1. <HI>Kings,</HI> 21.29.</NOTE></P>
<P>Do Believers turn from Sin, and live a Life of Holi|ne&s;s. In this al&s;o the Hypocrite imitates the Believer; yea, &s;ometimes to Appearance may go beyond him.&mdash;Such <HI>may e&s;cape the Pollutions of the World, thro' the Knowledge of the Lord Je&s;us,</HI> 2 Pet. 2.20. They may have the <HI>un|clean Spirit ca&s;t out</HI> by an external Reformation; yea, the inward Man may be <HI>&s;wept and garni&s;h'd,</HI> Mat. 12.43, 44. Their internal Lu&s;ts may be quench'd for a while; yea, the whole Ma&s;s of Sin laid a&s;leep, &amp; &s;eem|ingly mortify'd for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Do the Saints receive great A&s;&s;i&s;tances from Chri&s;t, and do great Services for him? And was not this the Ca&s;e of <HI>Saul,</HI> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 10.13. And likewi&s;e of <HI>Judas?</HI> Did he not do many <HI>Miracles,</HI> and perhaps <HI>awaken,</HI> if not <HI>convert</HI> &s;ome Souls? Oh! what <HI>A&s;&s;i&s;tances,</HI> and <HI>In|largements</HI> in Duties? what Divine <HI>Benedictions</HI> on their Labours, have &s;ome <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> received from Chri&s;t, who yet were never real Friends to him?</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="005926_0009_10276D67D67C1A80">What &s;hall I &s;ay more? Perhaps you may think the un&s;ound Profe&s;&s;or will not &s;tand the Te&s;t of the <HI>fiery Trial,</HI> but mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be di&s;cover'd when it comes to that.&mdash; Why this is no infallible Rule neither. Doth not <HI>Paul,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.3. &s;uppo&s;e that a Per&s;on may <HI>give his Body to be burned,</HI> or die a <HI>Martyr</HI> for Chri&s;t; and yet be de&s;titute of <HI>divine Love</HI> or <HI>Charity?</HI> It appears then that the Re&s;emblance between the Saints and Hy|pocrites come &s;o near, as that in many Ca&s;es it may be almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;tingui&s;h them.&mdash;</P>
<P>"And the Difference will yet be more &s;ubtle &amp; un|di&s;cernable (as Mr. <HI>Flavel</HI> ob&s;erves) if we con&s;ider, that as in &s;o many Things, the Hypocrite re&s;embles the Saint; &s;o there are other Things, in which a real Chri&s;tian may act too like an Hypocrite. &mdash; When we find &s;ays he, a <HI>Pharoah</HI> confe&s;&s;ing, an <HI>Herod</HI> practi&s;ing, as well as hearing, a <HI>Judas</HI> preaching Chri&s;t, an <HI>Alex|ander</HI> venturing his Life for <HI>Paul;</HI> and on the other Side, &s;hall find a <HI>David</HI> condemning that in another, which he practi&s;ed him&s;elf; and <HI>A&s;a</HI> in a Rage with a Pro|phet for faithfully reproving him, and putting him in Pri&s;on; a <HI>Jeho&s;haphat</HI> joining in Affinity with a wicked <HI>Ahab;</HI> an <HI>Hezekiah</HI> glorying in his Riches; a <HI>Peter</HI> di&s;|&s;embling; a <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> quarrelling and con|tending, and even all the Di&s;ciples for&s;aking Chri&s;t in an Hour of Trouble and Danger: &mdash; Oh then! how hard is it for the Eye of Man to di&s;cern between Chaff and Wheat? How many upright Hearts are now cen|&s;ur'd, whom GOD will clear? How many fal&s;e Hearts are now approved, whom GOD will condemn? Men ordinarily have no clear convictive Proofs, but only probable Symptoms, which at mo&s;t can beget but a <HI>conjectural Knowledge</HI> of another's State. &mdash; And they that &s;hall peremptorily judge either Way, may po&s;&s;ibly wrong the Generation of the Upright; or on the other

Side, ab&s;olve and ju&s;tify the Wicked. &mdash; And truly con|&s;idering what has been &s;aid, it is no great Wonder, that dangerous Mi&s;takes are &s;o frequently made in this Matter."</P>
<P N="1">I. Hence &s;ee the Error of tho&s;e who hold, that an <HI>ab&s;olute infallible Knowlege</HI> of the Brethren, is to be at|tain'd by ordinary Believers in this Life.</P>
<P>We may certainly know our own State; But, 'tis im|po&s;&s;ible for us, without divine In&s;piration, &s;uch as the Prophets had, ab&s;olutely to know the Goodne&s;s of ano|ther's State. &mdash; This is a Point, that has been much in my Meditation; and Time was when I my &s;elf tho't, that it was ea&s;ier to know a true Chri&s;tian, than I now find it to be, tho' I never gave in to the Doctrine of the <HI>infallible Knowlege.</HI> &mdash; And therefore I &s;hall with all Hu|mility and Meekne&s;s, lay before you &s;ome of tho&s;e Ar|guments which convinced me; and I beg you, Dear Brethren, to weigh them impartially in the Balance of the Sanctuary.</P>
<P>As for tho&s;e, who walk after the Cour&s;e of this World, fulfilling the De&s;ires of the Fle&s;h and of the Mind, and committing Iniquity with Greedine&s;s, their Ca&s;e is ea|&s;ily known; of the&s;e we may &s;ay without He&s;itation, <HI>They are in the Gall of Bitterne&s;s, and Bond of Iniquity.</HI>&mdash; And the &s;ame may be &s;aid of &s;ome formal Profe&s;&s;ors, who in their Di&s;cour&s;e bewray the mo&s;t wretched Ig|norance of the Nature of Conviction and Conver&s;ion.&mdash; Setting the&s;e a&s;ide, there are others who have had great Convictions, Illuminations &amp;c. &s;uch as we have men|tion'd under the Doctrine; and yet out of Chri&s;t.&mdash;And there are &s;ome al&s;o, who tho' de&s;titute of the&s;e in a great Mea&s;ure; yet by a&s;&s;ociating with Chri&s;tians, and hearing them frequently give an Account of their Ex|periences, and &s;eeing them in their Joys, can more ea|&s;ily pretend to have experienced the &s;ame Things; hav|ing

<P>The In&s;tance of <HI>Judas,</HI> which is &s;o often alledged at this Day, is al&s;o very much to the Purpo&s;e: The Apo&s;tles held Communion with this Man for above three Years, and did not &s;u&s;pect him; yea, they were more &s;u&s;picious of them&s;elves than of him. &mdash; But you will &s;ay, this was becau&s;e they were poor, weak, low Believers, and had not &s;o much Grace as we have. &mdash; But, my Brethren, con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly, does not this An&s;wer favour too much of <HI>&s;piritual Pride!</HI> Is it not contrary to the humble Ex|ample of the great Apo&s;tle, who was one of the mo&s;t eminent Believer's that ever was, when he cry'd out, <HI>I am le&s;s than the lea&s;t of all Saints! Eph.</HI> 3.8. And is it not an Argument of Weakne&s;s of Grace, rather than of Strength! For many Believers that have been of your Opinion at their fir&s;t Conver&s;ion, have rejected it as an Error, when they came to be more experienced in the divine Life. &mdash; Be&s;ides, were not the Apo&s;tles often in the high Exerci&s;e of Grace, e&s;pecially when they made that glorious Confe&s;&s;ion; <HI>We are &s;ure that thou art the Chri&s;t, the Son of the living GOD,</HI> Mat. 16.16. <HI>Job.</HI> 6.69.

He did not pretend to an <HI>object&punc; Knowledge</HI> of <HI>Sylva|nus's</HI> good E&s;tate, tho' intimately acquainted with him, and tho' he employ'd him as his Me&s;&s;enger to carry his Epi&s;tle Abroad; but only goes upon <HI>Suppo&s;ition</HI> and Pro|bability; which is the highe&s;t Knowledge that ordinary Believers can reach, &amp; even the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves with|out immediate Revelation.&mdash;We may collect from other Scriptures, that this <HI>Sylvanus</HI> was really a good Man; and yet the Apo&s;tle dur&s;t not a&s;&s;ert it ab&s;olutely.&mdash; And &s;hall we pretend to higher Attainments than this great Apo&s;tle? &mdash;</P>

<P><PB N="33" REF="005926_0035_10276DCF5805C7C0">The remaining OBSERVATIONS I mu&s;t be brief in.</P>
<P>The fourth OBSERVATION is, That <HI>&s;eeing</HI> TARES <HI>in the Church, is Matter of Grief to the Servants of Chri&s;t.</HI>&mdash; This is imply'd in the Text.</P>
<P>They are greatly affected at the <HI>Ignorance</HI> &amp; <HI>Scandals</HI> of Profe&s;&s;ors, and are often ready to cry out with <HI>David, Wo is me that I &s;ojourn in Me&s;hech, and that my Dwelling is in the Tents of Kedar.</HI>&mdash;Oh that the&s;e Tares were weeded, that <HI>I&s;hmael</HI> were ca&s;t out of Doors, &s;o that <HI>Sarah</HI> and her Son <HI>I&s;aac</HI> might live in Peace!</P>
<P>This leads me to a,</P>
<P N="5">V. OBSERVATION, <HI>Hence &s;ometimes they are &s;o offi|cious as to offer their Service to purge the Church. The Servants &s;aid unto him, wilt thou that we go and gather up the&s;e Tares?</HI> v. 28.</P>
<P N="1">1. This proceeds partly from <HI>Zeal,</HI> and <HI>Love to God.</HI> They act with <HI>good Views,</HI> tho' upon <HI>mi&s;taken Principles:</HI>&mdash; They verily think that GOD's Glory will be promoted thereby; hence their <HI>Love</HI> to him prompts them there|to.&mdash;They have truly <HI>a Zeal for God;</HI> but it is <HI>not ac|cording to Knowledge.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. This proceeds partly from <HI>&s;piritual Pride.</HI> There is a Mixture of good and bad in the be&s;t Saints; <HI>Fle&s;h</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> will remain together, 'till Death.&mdash; And among other corrupt Principles, <HI>Pride</HI> is the chief: This is the fir&s;t Sin that lives, and the la&s;t that dies; 'tis a Weed that grows in the be&s;t Soil; and it generally prevails <HI>mo&s;t,</HI> when we &s;ee it <HI>lea&s;t.&mdash;Young Converts</HI> are e&s;pecially prone to this Sin; they think that they know more, and can do better, than GOD knows they can: For want of <HI>Experience</HI> they are apt to <HI>out-run</HI> them&s;elves; e&s;pe|cially if they have been <HI>applauded</HI> by others for their <HI>Gifts</HI> and <HI>Graces,</HI> as has been the Ca&s;e too frequently: This makes them a&s;&s;uming and confident, and to treat all as Enemies, that oppo&s;e any of their darling Notions.
<PB N="34" REF="005926_0036_10276DDB695A1328">
Thus it is in the In&s;tance before us: <HI>Spiritual Pride</HI> makes them think, that 'tis one of the ea&s;ie&s;t Things in the World to know another's &s;piritual State: and 'tis nothing but Time and better Experience, that will con|vince them they are wrong, and make them more hum|ble.&mdash;In the mean Time they are all on Fire for <HI>purging</HI> the Church.

<P>My Brethren, how &s;tands the Ca&s;e with you? Are you truly united to Chri&s;t? Have you been beaten off by an Almighty Power from all Confidence in your Selves, and your own Works; and been bro't to acquie&s;ce in, to be well plea&s;ed with, and to venture your Souls upon, GOD's Plan of Salvation thro' <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t?</HI>&mdash;Has Chri&s;t the Supremacy in your Souls? Do you love and &s;eek him for <HI>him&s;elf?</HI> Do you take up your eternal <HI>Re&s;t</HI> in him, and in him alone? Is your Trea&s;ure in Heaven, and your Hearts there?&mdash;Do you really hate all Sin, &s;ecret as well as open? Are you willing to part with every Lu&s;t, without Exception; and to comply with every Duty the Lord hath enjoin'd?&mdash;Do you make Con&s;cience of <HI>&s;ecret</HI> Duties, as well as of tho&s;e that are <HI>open;</HI> and can't you content your &s;elves without <HI>real &s;en&s;ible Communion</HI> with GOD in Duty?&mdash;And do you

engage in the Service of GOD with Complacency and Delight, or is it a Ta&s;k and Burden to you?&mdash;Do you act from <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> as your <HI>Principle,</HI> and to Chri&s;t as your End? Is he the <HI>Alpha</HI> and <HI>Omega</HI> in all you do; or is it <HI>Self</HI> that you are &s;eeking?&mdash;Do you live as under the <HI>Eye of GOD,</HI> and &s;et Him always before you? And are you willing to come to the Light, &amp; to have your Deeds proved thereby?&mdash;Do you make Religion your <HI>main,</HI> or only a <HI>by-Bu&s;ine&s;s?</HI>&mdash;Do you walk <HI>humbly with</HI> GOD, being <HI>poor in Spirit,</HI> and <HI>lowly</HI> in your own Eyes?
