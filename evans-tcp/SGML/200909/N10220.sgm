<HEAD>To the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS with great reluctance that I am thus forced to enter the field of public controver&s;y. Nei|ther had I the lea&s;t de&s;ire or expectation of it, when I at fir&s;t propo&s;ed the <HI>que&s;tion</HI> to our church, which is the &s;ubject of the following pages. It was far from being agreeable to me, that it had been &s;o publick as it was before, when debated among&s;t our&s;elves, at our <HI>church-meetings.</HI> E&s;pecially in the <HI>manner</HI> in which the&s;e meetings were conducted and protracted from time to time. For I could perceive no peaceful or good effects likely to be produced by them, but the contrary: Which the church in general perceiving, they finally voted to <HI>di&s;&s;olve</HI> the meeting. It was at the&s;e &s;everal meetings that <HI>Mr. Cotton</HI> (formerly a <HI>mini&s;ter</HI> at <HI>Halifax</HI> in this county, but now a <HI>member</HI> of this church) delivered the&s;e <HI>E&s;&s;ays.</HI> I heard nothing of any de&s;ign of publi&s;hing them, till immediately after the la&s;t church meeting was <HI>di&s;&s;olved.</HI> 'Twas then given out with &s;ome warmth, that "now all he had read &s;hould be printed." And doubtle&s;s he had a right if he thought proper to print his <HI>arguments,</HI> or <HI>&s;en|timents</HI> on this or any other &s;ubject. But, what has been very &s;urprizing to almo&s;t every one among&s;t us, is his pub|li&s;hing tho&s;e <HI>private letters</HI> with his e&s;&s;ays. Which cer|tainly, it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, could ari&s;e from any friendly, benevolent &s;pirit; or an&s;wer any <HI>good</HI> end. And it was
<PB N="vi" REF="012984_0004_0F903E4113424C40">thought, hardly to look well, that this matter was kept &s;uch a profound &s;ecret, as that the <HI>&s;ub&s;cribers</HI> for his e&s;&s;ays &s;hould, in general, be ignorant of any &s;uch de&s;ign; who have &s;ince, &s;ome of them, &s;aid, had they known the&s;e <HI>letters</HI> were to be printed, they never would have &s;ub|&s;cribed at all. It is certain that the publi&s;hing <HI>the&s;e,</HI> has been the occa&s;ion of more trouble and unea&s;ine&s;s both to <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> as well as others (from &s;ome particular un|happy effects of them) than any thing that has taken place among&s;t us, relative to this debate. And whatever Mr. Cotton has &s;aid, or may &s;ay, to ju&s;tify it, this mu&s;t certainly be allowed to be a maxim of <HI>common &s;en&s;e</HI> as well as civility and good manners, viz. That every man has a right to &s;ay, whether <HI>his letters</HI> &s;hall be publi&s;hed to the world or not, let the <HI>occa&s;ion</HI> or <HI>&s;ubject</HI> of them be what it will. I &s;hould therefore have been exceeding glad to have excu&s;ed both the reader and my&s;elf, the trou|ble of the <HI>la&s;t &s;ection</HI> in this reply&mdash;which, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, contains matters, with which the <HI>publick</HI> have no immediate concern. I think it a great pity, that <HI>per&s;onal</HI> differences &s;hould be intermixed with a &s;ubject of common and publick concernment. Nothing &s;hould have induced me to it, had not Mr. Cotton publi&s;hed my <HI>letters,</HI> with his <HI>remarks</HI> upon them; whence it appeared to me nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay &s;omething, in order to &s;et &s;ome matters in a more ju&s;t point of light, which, I think Mr. Cotton has not given a fair repre&s;entation of; and to vindicate my&s;elf, (as it was, by my people, judged needful I &s;hould) from &s;ome very unkind a&s;per&s;ions which he has ca&s;t upon me; which otherwi&s;e, might have a tendency to hurt my cha|racter or u&s;efulne&s;s among tho&s;e who have only read Mr. Cotton's book, and are unacquainted with affairs in this place. I have &s;hewn freely, wherein I think he has <HI>mi&s;repre|&s;ented</HI>
<PB N="vii" REF="012984_0005_0F903E41CABDF060">me or my &s;entiments; or tho&s;e of the <HI>brethren</HI> on the &s;ame &s;ide with me&mdash;and have taken notice of tho&s;e things wherein I think he has injured me: This was nece&s;|&s;ary. And I have al&s;o endeavoured to &s;hew the weakne&s;s or fallacy of his arguments. But I have endeavoured, as much as po&s;&s;ible to avoid that unchri&s;tian heat and bitter|ne&s;s of &s;pirit, which many have complained of, as too manife&s;t in my antagoni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> e&s;pecially in his remarks, &amp;c.

If this be right, and agree|able
<PB N="viii" REF="012984_0006_0F903E428CD775D8">to the will of Chri&s;t&mdash;if it can be &s;upported from &s;cripture, let the practice be continued and prevail. But if not, why &s;hould it live? And why &s;hould not mini&s;ters and churches join to aboli&s;h a practice, which has no foun|dation in the word of God, and which has been the occa&s;ion of &s;o much grief and perplexity to many, and ('tis to be feared) a &s;nare to multitudes of others, who have been led (agreeable to <HI>cu&s;tom</HI>) to vow and promi&s;e to the Lord, they know not what. The endeavour to &s;hew the un|&s;cripturalne&s;s and dangerous tendency of <HI>this practice,</HI> is the de&s;ign of the following reply.

<HEAD>The Introduction.</HEAD>
<P>IN replying to Mr. Cotton's E&s;&s;ays, it may be proper in the fir&s;t place, to give &s;ome brief account of the RISE of this Debate in the fir&s;t church in <HI>Plymouth</HI>&mdash;Then of the arguments I have made u&s;e of, in the cour&s;e of the debate, again&s;t the <HI>half way practice,</HI> or admitting per&s;ons to <HI>own the covenant</HI> and have <HI>bapti&s;m</HI> for their children, without coming to the <HI>Lord's &s;upper</HI>&mdash; In the next place, to an&s;wer &s;ome <HI>objections</HI> and <HI>enquiries</HI>&mdash;After which, to make &s;ome more <HI>particular Remarks</HI> on Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI>'s per|formance, his manner of rea&s;oning, in &s;upport of the &s;cheme which he is endeavouring to maintain, and the <HI>various methods</HI> he has taken from time to time, for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Of the Ri&s;e of this Debate in this Church.</P>
<P>THE practice that has prevailed in many churches in <HI>New Eng|land,</HI> of admitting per&s;ons to <HI>own the covenant</HI> (as the u&s;ual phra&s;e is) and have <HI>bapti&s;m</HI> for their children, without coming to the other ordinance, &s;o contrary to the <HI>original plan</HI> of the&s;e churches, in the days of our ance&s;tors, has ever appeared to me at|tended with &s;ome difficulties, which I could not ea&s;ily get over. However, not attending &s;o thoroughly to the arguments that were u&s;ed in &s;upport of this &s;cheme, as I have endeavoured to do &s;ince, and being <HI>educated</HI> in the practice, I did &s;ubmit to it here for a number of years after I was ordained; tho' &s;till, not without &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s in my mind, at times, on account of the impropriety which there ap|pear'd to me in it: which at length (being al&s;o under better advantages for it than before) bro't me to a determination to &s;tudy the point more clo&s;ely than I ever had done, and &s;ee what light and &s;atisfac|tion I could obtain. To this end, I procured what <HI>authors</HI> I could,
<PB N="2" REF="012984_0008_0F903E4485659780">on both &s;ides of the que&s;tion&mdash;endeavoured to under&s;tand and com|pare their arguments with the &s;criptures, the only &s;ure, unerring &s;tan|dard of truth; not without earne&s;tly &s;eeking for light and direction of the great fountain of truth, <HI>from whom cometh every good and perfect gi&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The re&s;ult of my mo&s;t diligent enquiries, for many months, was a <HI>full conviction,</HI> in my own mind, that this practice has no foundation in &s;cripture to &s;upport it, but (as it had been carried on e&s;pecially in <HI>&s;ome</HI> places) it appeared to me, to be an unwarrantable pro&s;titution of a &s;acred ordinance of JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>In the&s;e circum&s;tances, I thought it my duty to de&s;i&s;t the practice.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tho' I never did reject or refu&s;e any per&s;on that came to me with a particular de&s;ire to own the covenant; as is repeatedly &s;ugge&s;ted by Mr. <HI>Cotton.</HI></NOTE> For it had always appeared unaccountable to me, when I have heard <HI>mini&s;ters</HI> declare their opinion <HI>again&s;t</HI> the practice, as not warranted by the word of God, that they could notwith&s;tanding per&s;i&s;t in it; or what &s;ort of <HI>prudence</HI> that is, which induces per&s;ons to <HI>compliances,</HI> (in things of <HI>this</HI> importance) which are contrary to the &s;criptures? The ca&s;e is very different, indeed, with tho&s;e who think there is <HI>&s;cripture warrant</HI> for thus dividing the &s;eals, or making &s;uch a di&s;tinction between the two ordinances.</P>
<P>As I could not con&s;cientiou&s;ly, in my pre&s;ent view of things, con|tinue any longer in this practice, I attempted, in &s;everal di&s;cour&s;es in publick, to &s;hew that it was not warrantable by the word of God, and offered &s;ome rea&s;ons why I thought it of dangerous tendency.</P>
<P>In the winter 1770, at a <HI>church-meeting,</HI> called by the de&s;ire of many of the brethren, to con&s;ider &s;ome things relative to <HI>church di&s;|cipline;</HI> among other matters, I propo&s;ed for their con&s;ideration, this <HI>que&s;tion;</HI> whether <HI>the practice</HI> was &s;criptural; in the terms men|tioned at the beginning of Mr. C.'s e&s;&s;ays. What rea&s;on he had to &s;ay "I was <HI>&s;trenuous</HI>" in the affair, I can't imagine. I am &s;ure I ma|nife&s;ted nothing of this kind, at that time: I did but propo&s;e it for their deliberation. I never reque&s;ted or expected the various <HI>meet|ings</HI> that followed; and which were attended with &s;uch unhappy effects and brought &s;o much difficulty, in the end. The que&s;tion was not much debated at that time, but it was de&s;ired it might be referred, for further con&s;ideration, to another opportunity. Afterwards, we had &s;everal church meetings; at which Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> delivered his &s;everal e&s;&s;ays, much in the form, in which they are publi&s;hed. Since therefore, this controver&s;y, "through the <HI>importunity</HI> of his friends," (he tells his readers) is become publick, though
<PB N="3" REF="012984_0009_0F903E45022FE020">very contrary to my de&s;ire or intention, it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary that <HI>I al&s;o &s;hould &s;hew mine opinion,</HI> and give a brief &s;ketch of the arguments I have made u&s;e of, in &s;upport of that &s;ide of the que&s;tion which I have e&s;pou&s;ed; which I &s;hall do, with &s;ome enlargements, in the following &s;ection.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECTION I.</HI> Rea&s;ons for not continuing the Practice.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. Becau&s;e I can find no text in the whole word of GOD, to ju&s;tify the practice; nor any example of a per&s;on's being allowed to <HI>cove|nant</HI> with God and make a &s;olemn profe&s;&s;ion of religion, and yet <HI>neglect</HI> to attend one of the &s;pecial and mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing commands and ordinances of God. His covenant people, both under the old and new Te&s;tament, not only were expre&s;sly <HI>commanded,</HI> but it is evident they always looked upon them&s;elves <HI>bound by covenant</HI> to ob&s;erve <HI>all</HI> divine in&s;titutions, and to "walk in <HI>all</HI> God's ordinances and commandments;" and that they had no warrant to make any <HI>exceptions</HI> or limitations, under <HI>any</HI> circum&s;tances, or upon <HI>any pre|tence</HI> whatever.</P>
<P>Accordingly, God's ancient covenant people, profe&s;s with one voice, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, Exod. xxiv. 7. ALL <HI>that the Lord hath &s;aid, will we do, and be obedient.</HI> This was the very import of the covenant, on their part; and 'tis plain they always under&s;tood it &s;o by their frequent, &s;olemn profe&s;&s;ions of the &s;ame nature from time to time. See <HI>Jo&s;h.</HI> xxiv. 25. <HI>Jer.</HI> xlii. 5, 6. <HI>Deut.</HI> xxvi. 17, 18. <HI>Jo&s;h.</HI> xxiv. 21. They never imagined they could, con&s;i&s;tent with their covenant relation and engagements to God, live in the neglect of any one divine ordinance. They were as much obliged hereby, to keep the <HI>Pa&s;&s;over,</HI> as to circumci&s;e their children; and thus they practi&s;ed univer&s;ally. So under the <HI>New Te&s;tament,</HI> all that profe&s;&s;ed love and di&s;ciple&s;hip to JESUS CHRIST, were con&s;tantly taught, "to ob|&s;erve <HI>all things</HI> what&s;oever he had commanded." There is no inti|mation in the go&s;pel, of any thing that looked like a <HI>double admi&s;&s;ion</HI> into the Church of CHRIST; or of per&s;ons, profe&s;&s;ing faith in CHRIST, being admitted to <HI>one</HI> ordinance while &s;omething further and higher was nece&s;&s;ary for their enjoyment of the <HI>other;</HI> as &s;eems to be the ca&s;e, upon our pre&s;ent plan. When <HI>John Bapti&s;t,</HI> and the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> had, thro' their preaching, brought any to Faith and Repen|tance; upon their <HI>profe&s;&s;ion</HI> hereof, they were received into the vi&s;ible Church or communion of Saints; and were looked upon as di&s;ciples;
<PB N="4" REF="012984_0010_0F903E4AA5645788">allowed to enjoy the priviledges of &s;uch, and were commanded to live and walk an&s;werable to their profe&s;&s;ion, in a careful ob&s;ervance of <HI>all</HI> Chri&s;t's commands. See <HI>Matt.</HI> iii. 8. and xxviii. 20. <HI>John</HI> xv 14. <HI>Luke</HI> vi. 46. 1 <HI>John</HI> ii. 4. <HI>Col.</HI> ii. 6. This was evidently the plan the Apo&s;tles and fir&s;t mini&s;ters of CHRIST went upon. Where do we hear of their <HI>dividing the &s;eals,</HI> as the manner is in our pre&s;ent practice? Where do we find them in&s;i&s;ting upon lower or "<HI>negative</HI> evidences" of Grace, as qualifying for <HI>one</HI> ordinance, and higher, <HI>po&s;itive</HI> evi|dences, as nece&s;&s;ary for the <HI>other?</HI> I could never find any &s;uch di&s;|tinction, in the word of God, nor any precept or example on which &s;uch a di&s;tinction can be founded. And if &s;o, what good rea&s;on can be given for the practice pleaded for, or how can we be ju&s;tifyed in per&s;i&s;ting in it?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It appears &s;omewhat &s;trange, that Mr. C. &s;hould charge me with acting "like the <HI>Anabapti&s;ts,</HI>" becau&s;e I required a Text of Scripture, to &s;upport the practice. I never did indeed demand "a <HI>direct</HI> &s;cripture in the ca&s;e." All I in&s;i&s;ted, was, that he &s;hould produce a Scripture that would <HI>ju&s;tify</HI> the practice, or on which it might be fairly grounded. If this is thought unrea&s;onable or <HI>anabapti&s;tical,</HI> all I can &s;ay in an&s;wer to it, is, that I had rather <HI>my faith,</HI> in this point, <HI>&s;hould &s;tand in the wi&s;dom of God</HI> than in the <HI>inventions</HI> of men. He has &s;aid, indeed, the practice can be vindicated by <HI>&s;cripture con&s;equence,</HI> but has no where proved it, as I have ob&s;erved; and until he can do it, I think it is but rea&s;onable to expect &s;ome other evidence than his bare a&s;&s;ertion.</NOTE></P>
<P>'Tis objected by &s;ome, that the apo&s;tles did <HI>divide the &s;eals,</HI> as they baptized, without ever &s;o much as acquainting the di&s;ciples of the other ordinance. I an&s;wer, if this be true, it is certainly a &s;uffi|cient rea&s;on for their <HI>not attending</HI> the other ordinance, when they had heard nothing about it. Yet it don't prove that they would not be <HI>obliged,</HI> by their chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion, to attend it whenever they <HI>&s;hould</HI> be made acquainted with it, and had opportunity; nor that any other qualifications in <HI>kind,</HI> were nece&s;&s;ary, than tho&s;e which they had exhibited in order to Bapti&s;m.</P>
<P N="2">II. Another rea&s;on is, I apprehend this practice has a tendency to lead per&s;ons to a <HI>direct breach of their mo&s;t expre&s;s covenant engage|ments.</HI> Which, I think will appear, if we con&s;ider the nature of tho&s;e engagements. What is the meaning of that &s;olemn tran&s;action? What do per&s;ons promi&s;e and engage to do, when they <HI>own the covenant?</HI> Is it not "to behave as becometh a true di&s;ciple of JESUS CHRIST," and to live and walk as &s;uch an one? The Cove|nant imports nothing, if it does not imply a promi&s;e of &s;ubjection to CHRIST in all <HI>his ordinances and commandments.</HI> This certainly is implied in covenanting <HI>according to the Go&s;pel.</HI> Therefore if a
<PB N="5" REF="012984_0011_0F903E4BF15C8150">per&s;on does not engage this, (by the help of God) he does not own <HI>God's covenant,</HI> and therefore can have no right to <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> either for him&s;elf or child; for Bapti&s;m is a &s;eal of no other Covenant. Will it not then, from hence nece&s;&s;arily follow, that when per&s;ons <HI>own the covenant</HI> with a view to enjoy Bapti&s;m for their children, and do not propo&s;e to go any further, but allowedly live, (as many do, all their days) in the neglect of that expre&s;s command of CHRIST, <HI>Do this in remembrance of me,</HI> that &s;uch, I &s;ay, do in a <HI>direct</HI> manner counteract their own covenant engagements? Does not &s;uch a con|duct look like &s;omething wor&s;e than trifling? Has it not the appear|ance of &s;olemn di&s;&s;imulation in a matter of the highe&s;t importance? Is not the plain language of it this&mdash;"I &s;olemnly avouch the Lord to be my GOD, and JESUS CHRIST to be my Savior, and promi&s;e to walk in all his ordinances and commandments, <HI>except one,</HI> blamele&s;s; as to that <HI>one,</HI> I pray thee have me excu&s;ed." How ab&s;urd, how &s;hocking is the thought! Yet, as it appears to me, &s;omething like this, &s;eems to be the import of this practice, however the per&s;on may be far from being aware of it when he owns his bapti&s;mal covenant, And this leads me to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="3">III. That this practice has a tendency to lead per&s;ons to think there are <HI>two covenants,</HI> in &s;ome important re&s;pects, different from each other; viz. <HI>One,</HI> that a per&s;on may &s;afely enter into, who don't look upon him&s;elf to be a <HI>real Chri&s;tian.</HI> The <HI>other,</HI> none mu&s;t enter into, but tho&s;e who have good evidence that they are true Believers. I may appeal to hundreds for the truth of this, in tho&s;e places where it is practi&s;ed. Many would not dare to make the profe&s;&s;ion which tho&s;e per&s;ons do who <HI>join to the Church;</HI> but yet think they may <HI>&s;afely own the covenant.</HI> And why? Becau&s;e they think they are fit for the <HI>latter,</HI> but by no means for the <HI>former.</HI> And if you &s;till enquire the rea&s;on; the an&s;wer is, they don't think they are <HI>good</HI> enough. Thus they plainly make a di&s;tinction between the&s;e two profe&s;&s;ions, as if, in their nature and de&s;ign, they were different covenants.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, I know, that this is the fault of the <HI>mini&s;ter:</HI> He &s;hould in&s;truct them otherwi&s;e, and let them know that there is but <HI>one</HI> covenant. &mdash; I an&s;wer, not all the in&s;truction in the world. will remove the difficulty, in the minds of &s;ome. After the utmo&s;t pains taken by the mini&s;ter, to correct their mi&s;take, and to &s;how them the nature of covenanting with GOD, yet there are &s;ome, who cannot be fully convinced, but will retain the <HI>di&s;tinction</HI> between the
<PB N="6" REF="012984_0012_0F903E4E2B3F8880">covenants, and think that one requires <HI>different kind</HI> of qualifications from the other. And it is not at all to be wondered at, where per|&s;ons have been, from their childhood nur&s;ed up in this practice. It appears to me, it has a natural and nece&s;&s;ary tendency to &s;uch an effect.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. C. indeed has propo&s;ed a method in order to get rid of this difficulty, i. e. to <HI>lay a&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> the practice of owning the covenant, for tho&s;e that only would have their children baptized&mdash;that they &s;hall make <HI>no explicit profe&s;&s;ion,</HI> but be al|lowed to bring their children, without; provided they have been baptized <HI>them|&s;elves,</HI> and are not &s;candalous.
<P>Upon which, I would ob&s;erve, 1. This would be as much an <HI>innovation,</HI> as any Mr. C. complains of; and contrary to the plan propo&s;ed by the <HI>Synod,</HI> which is &s;o much in&s;i&s;ted on. This might therefore, perhaps, be thought by &s;ome a &s;uf|ficient rea&s;on to &s;et it a&s;ide. Yet 2. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed this would &s;eem more con&s;i&s;tent than the other method. Any one would think, that if per&s;ons mu&s;t have their children baptized, whether they them&s;elves are <HI>real</HI> chri&s;tians or no, it mu&s;t be le&s;s &s;inful to bring them without making any Covenant at all, than to make &s;uch &s;olemn promi&s;es, and break them immediately. But 3. It would not, at all help the matter, really; or in the lea&s;t remove the difficulty, it is intended for. For whether the&s;e per&s;ons <HI>own the covenant verbally,</HI> or not, yet the very <HI>nature of the action</HI> of a parent, in offering up his child in Bapti&s;m, im|plies a &s;olemn covenanting with God; (as Mr. C. acknowledges, p. 8.) 'Tis as much as to &s;ay, "I acknowledge the Covenant of which Bapti&s;m is a Seal, to be God's covenant, and the terms of it wi&s;e and gracious, in token of my com|pliance with which, I now &s;eal the Covenant, by actively dedicating my child to to God, in this holy ordinance, thereby choo&s;ing him for my God and the God of my child." So that if it be unlawful or incon&s;i&s;tent for a gracele&s;s per&s;on to own that &s;olemn covenant <HI>in words,</HI> it mu&s;t al&s;o be &s;o to offer his child in Bapti&s;m, which nece&s;&s;arily implies a covenant tranfaction.</P></NOTE></P>
<P N="4">IV. The &s;ame e&s;&s;ential qualifications, which the &s;criptures make nece&s;&s;ary for <HI>one</HI> ordinance, are required for the <HI>other.</HI> Neither the Forerunner, nor the Apo&s;tles of CHRIST, have &s;aid any thing, on which &s;uch a di&s;tinction can be ju&s;tly founded, as is now made. As they in&s;i&s;ted on repentance and faith as nece&s;&s;ary in order to accep|tance with God and remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, &s;o they in&s;i&s;ted upon the <HI>profe&s;&s;ion</HI> of them in order to their being admitted into the <HI>vi&s;i|ble</HI> kingdom or church of CHRIST. They baptized none, but upon this ground. Tho&s;e who appeared, to a judgment of charity, to have the&s;e qualifications, they admitted to Bapti&s;m, and tho&s;e only. See <HI>Mat.</HI> iii. 6. <HI>Acts</HI> xvi. 14, 15. and viii. 37, 38. and xvi. 31&mdash;33. and xix. 4, 5.

<PB N="7" REF="012984_0013_0F903E4F71713DE8">vi&s;ible Believers, as long as they appeared to act agreeable to the character of &s;uch. In a word, from the whole tenor of the New-Te&s;tament, it is plain, that nothing le&s;s or lower than a Profe&s;&s;ion of Faith and true repentance, was required in order to a per&s;on's enjoying the privilege of <HI>Bapti&s;m;</HI> and nothing more, or of a higher kind, was nece&s;&s;ary for admi&s;&s;ion to the <HI>Lord's-Supper.</HI> The di|&s;tinction of <HI>higher</HI> and <HI>lower</HI> qualifications for the two ordinances, and the notion of <HI>negative evidences</HI> (which in this ca&s;e is, in fact, no evidence at all; for as it is a negation of that which would merit <HI>cen&s;ure,</HI> on the one hand, &s;o it is a negation, or the ab&s;ence, or want of that which is a proper ground of charity in <HI>this ca&s;e</HI>) being a &s;ufficient qualification for <HI>Bapti&s;m,</HI> was never learnt from the New-Te&s;tament, but is, doubtle&s;s, of mere human invention.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If this point were to be decided by human te&s;timonies, as it is not, I could pro|duce &s;cores of Divines, who have in&s;i&s;ted as above.

V. I look upon this practice, not only to be unfounded in &s;cripture, but of very bad and <HI>dangerous tendency;</HI> e&s;pecially on the&s;e two accounts. 1. That it tends to lead per&s;ons to think they can cove|nant with God, and that he accepts of and is plea&s;ed with them, and will admit them to the &s;pecial privileges of his children, even while they are really <HI>unbelievers.</HI> Than which doctrine, nothing can be more pernicious to the &s;ouls of men, or more directly &s;ubver&s;ive of the &s;cripture account of &s;uch per&s;ons; which teaches, that "<HI>they who are in the fle&s;h</HI> CANNOT PLEASE GOD;" and that, "<HI>the carnal mind is</HI> ENMITY <HI>again&s;t God.</HI>" Whereas, by the other doctrine, we confound all di&s;tinctions between the <HI>regenerate</HI> and <HI>unregene|rate,</HI> converted and unconverted. We u&s;ed to be taught, that none but Believers could, in truth, call God <HI>their</HI> God&mdash;that none but &s;uch were in favor with God. But if unregenerates may <HI>&s;afely</HI> "avouch the Lord for their God"&mdash;where is the material difference between a believer and an unbeliever? And why do mini&s;ters ever repre&s;ent the &s;tate of the <HI>latter</HI> to be &s;o infinitely dangerous and dreadful? as being the daily objects of the wrath of God? But this is not all, for 2dly, There is rea&s;on to think, this practice tends to promote a <HI>carele&s;s, &s;ecure &s;pirit</HI> in the per&s;ons them&s;elves. If the truth could be known, I doubt not, it would appear that it has had this awful effect, in a great many in&s;tances, where per&s;ons have, before, appeared to be under &s;ome &s;erious impre&s;&s;ions; yet, having <HI>own'd the covenant,</HI> their con&s;ciences &s;eem to have found &s;omething to re&s;t upon, and they pre&s;ently grow &s;ecure. Neither will this appear at all &s;trange, when we con&s;ider how natural it is for per&s;ons, who have &s;ome convictions of their mi&s;erable and dan|gerous &s;tate, to &s;eek for &s;omething to quiet their con&s;ciences, &s;hort of CHRIST. If they are allowed and encouraged, under &s;uch circum|&s;tances, to come and covenant with God; and are told that they are thenceforward to be looked upon and treated as <HI>Saints,</HI> and have a right to all the vi&s;ible privileges of &s;uch, how naturally will their concern le&s;&s;en, till their convictions are worn off; and notwith&s;tand|ing all the cautions they have had not to re&s;t there, but to pre&s;s for|ward and make &s;ure of an intere&s;t in CHRIST, yet all don't avail; through the temptation of Satan and the natural pride of their hearts, taking occa&s;ion from their being called <HI>vi&s;ible chri&s;tians,</HI> they grow carele&s;s, and at length "return like the dog to his vomit, and the &s;ow that was wa&s;hed to her wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lowing in the mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e." I can't but be afraid, this practice has had this ruinous effect upon multitudes of
<PB N="9" REF="012984_0015_0F903E50D8CB7D08">&s;ouls. And &s;urely mini&s;ters and churches have no need to add to the temptations that &s;inners are under to carnal &s;ecurity, or do any thing that tends to &s;oothe and lull them to &s;leep, in their infinitely dangerous circum&s;tances. What can be the cau&s;e, that &s;uch per&s;ons &s;top here&mdash;many neglecting all their days to come to the other ordi|nance? Mu&s;t it not be, either that they had no ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of what they were about, and of the promi&s;es they made at owning the cove|nant; or if they had then any religious impre&s;&s;ions, that they are, by this means, worn off? And indeed it mu&s;t be allowed that &s;uch <HI>breaches</HI> of &s;olemn vows, as many are guilty of, have a natural ten|dency to fear the con&s;cience and harden the heart to a great degree.</P>
<P>For the foregoing rea&s;ons, with many others that might be men|tioned, I cannot think the practice warrantable, but un&s;criptural and therefore of dangerous tendency.</P>

<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes, provided he is of a &s;ober, blamele&s;s life and conver&s;ation, and "does not carry the <HI>Devil's mark,</HI> i. e. a profane life."</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Why do you make this <HI>provi&s;o</HI> in the ca&s;e? Then <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> of it&s;elf, is not a &s;ufficient qualification?</P>

(Tho' this will by no means follow, from what I have &s;aid) The argument is grounded on this, viz: That God di&s;allows of, and forbids per&s;ons coming to &s;pecial Ordi|nances, in <HI>Hypocri&s;y.</HI> Now if it can be proved, that an unregenerate man, tho' baptized, and outwardly regular, can come to this ordinance <HI>without hypocri&s;y,</HI> then the argument is overthrown.

<P><HI>A</HI> 'Tis a common, moral &s;incerity, as di&s;tinguf&s;hed from gracious: If he is not a "willful hypocrite," or does not come with a de&s;ign to mock God with a pretence, but from a &s;en&s;e of duty, his &s;in would not be &s;o great, nor would he "offend God &s;o much, by coming, as &s;taying away, though he be no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> regenerate."</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> But can there by any <HI>real &s;incerity,</HI> &s;uch as God will accept, where the <HI>heart</HI> is wanting? does he not require the Heart?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes; he requires it in every duty. But a per&s;on may be <HI>heartily &s;incere,</HI> even tho' he be not truly gracious.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Pray what do you under&s;tand by <HI>unregenerate?</HI> I have ever thought, and orthodox divines have always de&s;cribed <HI>unregeneracy,</HI> in t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> very nature of it, to con&s;i&s;t in the total alienation or oppo&s;ition <HI>of the heart</HI> to God. Therefore I would again enquire, what kind of <HI>hearty</HI> &s;incerity that per&s;on can exerci&s;e, in his approaches to God, who&s;e <HI>heart</HI> is entirely again&s;t God, full of reigning enmity to him, and one who, according to CHRIST'S own account, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ateth both him and the father?</HI> who is an enemy to the covenant of grace and re|fu&s;es to &s;ubmit to it?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Well, then according to this, an unregenerate &s;inner mu&s;t not read nor pray, nor attend public wor&s;hip; for he can do none of the&s;e in a gracious manner. It puts an end to all means of grace, as being of any &s;ervice to the unregenerate. But I &s;ay, the "total neglect of the&s;e duties is much more &s;inful and provoking to God, than the un|due performance," and the contrary doctrine de&s;troys every thing at once, and leads to the mo&s;t open licentiou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> You either mi&s;apprehend me here, or el&s;e you don't argue ju&s;tly. I do not hold that an unregenerate per&s;on mu&s;t not read or pray or

You will not a&s;&s;ert, that nothing more is required in order to a lawful atten|dance on the <HI>latter,</HI> than the <HI>former.</HI> For you will allow that an <HI>unbaptized</HI> per&s;on may lawfully go to meeting, hear the word, &amp;c. but you don't think it lawful for an <HI>unbaptized</HI> per&s;on to bring his child to bapti&s;m. So that your objection is of no weight, your&s;elf being judge. Therefore 'tis unrea&s;onable for you to &s;ay, that becau&s;e I in&s;i&s;t that &s;ome <HI>&s;pecial</HI> qualifications are nece&s;&s;ary in order to a lawful attending on the Sacraments, therefore a per&s;on mu&s;t not at|tend upon any <HI>other means of grace,</HI> without the&s;e qualifications. It does not follow that becau&s;e unbelievers cannot attend on <HI>covenant</HI> tran&s;actions without hypocri&s;y and lying, therefore they cannot &s;ay or do <HI>any thing</HI> without lying. Whatever implies this, they cer|tainly ought not to do.</P>
<P>Therefore, I think it is manife&s;t, that the objection, that this &s;cheme tends to de&s;troy all obligations on &s;inners to attend the <HI>means of grace</HI> is without the lea&s;t foundation; and that, from the nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>gracious &s;incerity,</HI> for a per&s;on's lawfully attending on <HI>&s;pecial &s;ealing ordinances,</HI> it can never be argued that a per&s;on ought not to attend on the <HI>common means of grace,</HI> while in an unregenerate &s;tate.</P>
<P>And I am humbly of opinion, that from what has been &s;aid, it will al&s;o follow, that we mu&s;t either deny <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> to be a <HI>&s;eal</HI> of the covenant of grace&mdash;Or affirm that a parent is <HI>not active</HI> in &s;ealing of it, when he &s;olemnly offers up his child to God in that ordinance&mdash;or el&s;e grant that no per&s;on while unregenerate has a right, or (know|ing him&s;elf to be &s;o) can lawfully, and without wicked di&s;&s;imulation, come to that ordinance&mdash;unle&s;s we will rather give up one of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential doctrines of <HI>Calvini&s;m,</HI> and a&s;&s;ert, that <HI>unregenerate</HI> men are not totally depraved, nor wholly enemies to God and his cove|nant; but can, <HI>as &s;uch,</HI> do &s;omething that &s;hall be plea&s;ing and acceptable to God; or in other words, that <HI>they who are in the fle&s;h can plea&s;e God;</HI> in direct contradiction to the expre&s;s declarations of God, <HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 8. &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION III.</HI> An&s;wers to &s;everal Objections and Enquiries.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> I. SAYS the Parent, tho' I am not &s;atisfied that I am in a gracious &s;tate, or that I belong to the <HI>invi&s;ible</HI> Church of Chri&s;t; yet by my <HI>bapti&s;m,</HI> I was made a member of the <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> Church, and therefore, whether I can claim <HI>&s;aving</HI> Ble&s;&s;ings or no, yet I have a right to <HI>vi&s;ible,</HI> outward Priviledges, and &s;uch I have right to demand, particularly <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> for my Children.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 1. Granting all you &s;ay; This will not prove the lawful|ne&s;s of our pre&s;ent practice, of admitting to <HI>one</HI> ordinance, end not to the <HI>other.</HI> If there be any force in your argument, it will prove that you have as good a right to the <HI>Lord's Supper,</HI> as to <HI>Bapti&s;m;</HI> for one is as much a <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> priviledge of the covenant, as the other. If therefore, your being baptized, gives you a lawful claim to <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> for your child, it certainly gives you a right to the <HI>Lord's Supper</HI> for your&s;elf. And not only &s;o, but it makes it your bounden <HI>duty</HI> to come to both ordinances. So that here is no room left for dividing the &s;eals. For that which gives any per&s;on a <HI>right</HI> to a chri&s;tian priviledge, doubtle&s;s makes it his <HI>duty</HI> to attend upon and enjoy that priviledge, when he has opportunity. How then can you think your&s;elf at liberty to neglect one &s;pecial ordinance of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as well as a precious priviledge? But,</P>
<P N="2">2. 'Tis true, by Bapti&s;m in infancy you was initiated into the vi&s;i|ble church of CHRIST; i. e. by your parent's act, you was introduced into the number of God's <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> covenant-people. But then it is but rea&s;onably expected of you, that &s;ince you are now prown up to adult age, you &s;hould make your <HI>parents</HI> act your <HI>own,</HI> by an open chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion. So long as you refu&s;e to acknowledge your con|&s;ent to the covenant, to confe&s;s Chri&s;t before men, profe&s;&s;ing a readi|ne&s;s to obey all his commands, what right have you to be received and treated as a chri&s;tian in good &s;tanding? He that is not <HI>for</HI> Chri&s;t, is <HI>again&s;t</HI> him. And do you not <HI>renounce</HI> what your parents did, when they dedicated you to Chri&s;t in bapti&s;m?</P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> II. My attending the public wor&s;hip and ordinances of God, and de&s;iring bapti&s;m for my child, are a &s;ufficient evidence that I do not renounce the covenant I was brought into by my bapti&s;m, but own and con&s;ent to it.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> This, of it&s;elf, can be no proper evidence of it to the church at all. For that which is found in per&s;ons who make <HI>no pretence</HI> to
<PB N="14" REF="012984_0020_0F903E5491793888">real, &s;aving religion; who know and own them&s;elves to be enemies to God and his covenant, cannot certainly be any proper evidence of <HI>compliance</HI> with it in another per&s;on; or afford a ju&s;t ground of a <HI>vi&s;ibility</HI> of true religion, in a judgment of rational charity. That which is common to both good and bad, gracious and ungracious per&s;ons, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be looked upon &s;uch a profe&s;&s;ion of religion, as Chri&s;t makes nece&s;&s;ary in order to admi&s;&s;ion to &s;ealing ordinances, or to the &s;pecial privileges of his di&s;ciples. The truth, in &s;hort, is, none do conform to their bapti&s;mal covenant, but tho&s;e who do <HI>all things</HI> what&s;oever Chri&s;t has commanded. Your attending on God's wor&s;hip and ordinances in &s;ome in&s;tances, and neglecting others, as important, and as plainly commanded&mdash;your offering your child to bapti&s;m, while you refu&s;e explicitly to confe&s;s Chri&s;t and come to the holy &s;upper, is rather again&s;t you than for you. It imports an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;urdity; and &s;hews you to be too ignorant of the nature of that tran&s;action, of offering up a child to God in bapti&s;m; than which, nothing can &s;imply a more &s;olemn <HI>covenanting</HI> with God.</P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> III. Well, &s;ays the parent, I am willing then, publickly to own the Covenant, and make a profe&s;&s;ion of religion&mdash;and thus make my Parents Act, my own. What hinders me now from enjoying bapti&s;m for my Child?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> You will not think me unrea&s;onable here, if I tell you, two things are very nece&s;&s;ary for you, in this ca&s;e. One is, that you ought to under&s;tand what you do, and to know what you are going about, in &s;uch a &s;olemn affair as this is, <HI>covenanting with the great Gods.</HI> And the other is, that if you do <HI>vow</HI> and promi&s;e to the Lord, you ought to <HI>perform</HI> what you promi&s;e; otherwi&s;e it will be but &s;olemn mockery. You ought at lea&s;t, to purpo&s;e and intend to per|form, by the help of God.</P>
<P N="1">1. You ought to know and well under&s;tand what it is to covenant with God, before you go about it; and not go on blindfold in &s;uch a &s;olemn tran&s;action. Now if the ca&s;e be truly as you &s;ay, i. e. if there be <HI>&s;uch an heart</HI> in you, as far as you are able to judge, upon the mo&s;t careful and &s;erious con&s;ideration; I tru&s;t none will object to your coming, and <HI>owning your bapti&s;mal covenant;</HI> I am &s;ure, none ought to refu&s;e you. (Obj.) But don't you hold that <HI>a&s;&s;urance</HI> is nece&s;&s;ary? I have heard you held it; and that none can &s;afely come but &s;uch as <HI>know</HI> they are truly gracious. (An&s;.) No, I do not hold this. I do not think you ought to wait till you have <HI>a&s;&s;urance</HI> of your regenerate &s;tate. I never held or taught &s;uch doctrine; nei|ther will this follow from my principles. I think 'tis your duty to
<PB N="15" REF="012984_0021_0F903E59748A7850">come, if the ca&s;e be with you, as de&s;cribed above; and the duty of the church to receive you; for we are not to <HI>break the brui&s;ed r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d.</HI> But then you ought, on the other hand, to be careful that you do not mock God, by making <HI>a &s;hew</HI> of covenanting, when you do not do it in &s;incerity of heart; and have rea&s;on to think you have never really cho&s;en God for your portion. A con&s;cientious per&s;on, &s;urely would be afraid to come and profe&s;s before God, Angels and Men, that he does <HI>this day avouch the Lord for his God,</HI> when he has good rea&s;on to think that he is to this day an enemy to God, has no &s;aving know|ledge of, or love to him. Perhaps when you &s;ay you are willing to own your bapti&s;mal covenant, you mean, you are willing to &s;tand up, as the manner is, before the congregation, and hear the <HI>common form</HI> of covenanting read by the mini&s;ter, bow your a&s;&s;ent to it, and then bring your children out to bapti&s;m. But I mu&s;t tell you, this is not all that is meant by <HI>owning, or entering into covenant</HI> with God. If your heart don't go along with the words of the covenant; if you have rea&s;on to think the di&s;po&s;ition of your heart does not agree to the words of your mouth, it is all but a piece of formal hypocri&s;y, and mu&s;t be very di&s;plea&s;ing to a holy God. Such per&s;ons might well expect that awful demand in P&s;al. l. 16. <HI>What ha&s;t thou to do&mdash;that thou &s;hould&s;t take</HI> MY COVENANT <HI>in thy mouth!</HI></P>
<P>But if you have rea&s;on to think, upon the mo&s;t diligent and prayerful examination of your &s;tate, by the rules of God's word, that there is &s;uch a heart in you, that you find in your&s;elf a freedom, and willingne&s;s to give up your&s;elf to God thro' Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and devote your all to him forever, according to the tenor of your bapti&s;mal covenant, I would encourage you, as a mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, to come and do it, and God be with you. There can be no rea&s;onable objec|tion to your being received to all the privileges of <HI>that covenant,</HI> which was <HI>&s;ealed to you</HI> in bapti&s;m. But then,</P>
<P N="2">2. You ought to be careful to <HI>perform</HI> as well as <HI>promi&s;e</HI> to God. For <HI>better is it that thou &s;hould&s;t not vow, than that thou &s;hould&s;t vow and not pay.</HI> Eccl. v. 5. By owning your covenant, you engage, by a &s;olemn vow, to live and walk as a <HI>di&s;ciple</HI> of JESUS CHRIST, to &s;ubmit to all his in&s;titutions and to <HI>walk in</HI> ALL <HI>his command|ments and ordinances blamele&s;s.</HI> This, as has been before ob&s;erved, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> what is implied in the very nature of covenanting with God. How then can you think of doing this, when at the &s;ame time you do not
<PB N="16" REF="012984_0022_0F903E5B0198EF80">intend, or think it your <HI>pre&s;ent duty</HI> to attend upon that &s;pecial or|dinance and command of Chri&s;t, <HI>Do this in remembrance of me.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">And how can a Church, con&s;i&s;tently uphold a practice, which has a direct ten|dency to make per&s;ons think they may <HI>lawfully covenant</HI> with God, and yet <HI>lawfully neglect</HI> one of his known Commands? What is this, but <HI>virtually</HI> en|couraging them in a manife&s;t Breach of their &s;olemn covenant Engagements? And do we not evidently do this, when we plead for &s;uch doctrines and practices as the&s;e; That a per&s;on may lawfully own the covenant, if he has <HI>no grace</HI>&mdash; that "the doing this, would be <HI>le&s;s offen&s;ive to God,</HI> than the <HI>omi&s;&s;ion,</HI> even <HI>if he &s;hould be</HI> really <HI>unregenerate.</HI>" That a per&s;on may lawfully be admitted to a covenant tran&s;action with God, if he has <HI>no other</HI> or higher <HI>"principle than love to his children"</HI>&mdash;and that he may lawfully be admitted to bapti&s;m for his child, tho' he does not at pre&s;ent, intend, or think it his duty, to come to the other ordinance, &s;o expre&s;ly commanded by JESUS CHRIST.&mdash;What is this, but being, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e, acce&s;&s;ary to, and &s;o <HI>partakers of other men's &s;ins?</HI> There is not one truth in the New Te&s;tament, plainer than this, viz. That 'tis the indi&s;|pen&s;ible duty of all the Followers of Chri&s;t, to partake of the Lord's Supper, <HI>in remembrance of him.</HI> But certainly they who own or enter into covenant with God, do profe&s;s to be his <HI>Di&s;ciples</HI> and followers&mdash;therefore are bound by the mo&s;t &s;acred ties, to attend <HI>that</HI> ordinance, upon pain of forfeiting the Character and all the Priviledges of his Di&s;ciples. And therefore, no Per&s;on, Church or Power on Earth, can lawfully di&s;pen&s;e with &s;uch attendance. And it appears equally plain to me, that no church can lawfully (by a publick vote) e&s;tabli&s;h, maintain or continue a <HI>practice,</HI> which, by plain con&s;truction, does imply &s;uch kind of forbearance or di&s;pen&s;ation. From all which I think it evident, that the <HI>practice</HI> pleaded for, cannot be ju&s;tified or &s;upported either from Scripture, or the rea&s;on and nature of Things.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> IV. The <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> church had all their children <HI>circumci&s;ed;</HI> and were commanded by God to do it, or they &s;hould be <HI>cut off.</HI> And none can &s;uppo&s;e they were all <HI>gracious</HI> per&s;ons&mdash;or that they were required to make a <HI>publick profe&s;&s;ion</HI> that implied it: And why may not all children be bapti&s;ed now, of tho&s;e in <HI>vi&s;ible cove|nant</HI>&mdash;I mean the children of baptized parents; ina&s;much as all allow bapti&s;m comes in the room of circumci&s;ion?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 1. Should all this be allowed, yet this won't ju&s;tify the <HI>prac|tice</HI> we are &s;peaking of. Nay if this argument has any weight at all, it is directly again&s;t the Practice. For you, and every one mu&s;t allow, that the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> were as much obliged and commanded to <HI>eat the pa&s;&s;over,</HI> as to <HI>circumci&s;e</HI> their children. So that your ar|gument, if any thing to the purpo&s;e, proves it to be the indi&s;pen&s;ible duty of all that bring their children to <HI>bapti&s;m,</HI> to come them|&s;elves to the <HI>Lord's table.</HI> And here, I pray that it may be care|fully ob&s;erved, that the circumci&s;ed adults in <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> were not admit|ted to the priviledge of circumci&s;ion for their <HI>children,</HI> but were <HI>cut
<PB N="17" REF="012984_0023_0F903E5B629174F0">off,</HI> by the expre&s;s command of God, from <HI>all the Privileges</HI> of his covenant people if they neglected or refu&s;ed to attend on the <HI>Pa&s;&s;o|ver.</HI> See <HI>Numb.</HI> ix. 13. <HI>But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey and</HI> FORBEARETH TO EAT THE PASSOVER, <HI>even the &s;ame &s;oul &s;hall be</HI> CUT OFF <HI>from his people.</HI> Whether this exci&s;ion intends, being <HI>put to death,</HI> or not, yet none deny that it intended at lea&s;t, their being cut off from <HI>all the &s;pecial pri|viledges</HI> of God's covenant people, or <HI>vi&s;ible Saints.</HI> Now I think it but a rea&s;onable reque&s;t, that tho&s;e, who are for run|ning back to the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> di&s;pen&s;ation, and build &s;o much upon that, for the &s;upport of <HI>this practice,</HI> &s;hould endeavour to re|concile it with this text. I think it affords a very &s;trong argument at lea&s;t, for not treating tho&s;e per&s;ons as <HI>vi&s;ible &s;aints,</HI> who refu&s;e or neglect to attend the <HI>Lord's Supper,</HI> and for denying them the priviledges of God's covenant people, if not for ca&s;ting them out. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. Tho&s;e are evidently mi&s;taken, who a&s;&s;ert that, the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> were not required to make a <HI>public profe&s;&s;ion</HI> of their covenant en|gagements to God. It is manife&s;t from &s;cripture, that they were commanded &s;olemnly to renew covenant, in a public manner, even the whole congregation, every <HI>&s;eventh year.</HI>&mdash;So that none could have children to circumci&s;e, who had not before made a public pro|fe&s;&s;ion of religion. See <HI>Deut.</HI> xxxi. 9&mdash;12. <HI>And</HI> Mo&s;es <HI>wrote this law, and delivered it unto the prie&s;ts, the &s;ons of</HI> Levi <HI>which bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and unto all the elders of I&s;rael; and</HI> Mo&s;es <HI>commanded them &s;aying, At the end of</HI> EVERY SEVEN YEARS <HI>in the &s;olemnity of the year of relea&s;e&mdash;when all I&s;rael is come to appear before the Lord thy God, in the place which he &s;hall choo&s;e, thou &s;halt read</HI> THIS LAW, <HI>before all I&s;rael, in their hearing,</HI> &amp;c. Now that this intends a <HI>public renewal of cove|nant</HI> with God, is manife&s;t, not only from this, that the <HI>law</HI> or ten commandments, are frequently called God's <HI>covenant,</HI> as the law, &s;ummarily contained that covenant, &s;o that whenever there was, among that people, a publick, &s;olemn profe&s;&s;ion of obedience to it, by God's in&s;titution, it mu&s;t be looked upon as an explicit <HI>covenanting</HI> with God&mdash;but it will be evident, beyond all rea&s;onable doubt, that in <HI>this place</HI> &s;uch public renewal of covenant is meant, if we will compare <HI>this pa&s;&s;age</HI> and its connection with the xxix chapter, 10&mdash;15 ver&s;es. <HI>Ye &s;tand all of you this day before the Lord your God&mdash;that thou &s;hould&s;t</HI> ENTER INTO COVENANT <HI>with the Lord thy God, and into his oath.</HI> That which is here called GOD'S <HI>covenant</HI> and
<PB N="18" REF="012984_0024_0F903E5C0DC97AE0">oath, is in the forementioned place called his <HI>law.</HI> And whoever will be at the pains to read attentively, the&s;e three chapters, viz. from the xxixth to the xxxiid, mu&s;t &s;ee, that what the people of I&s;rael were commanded to do every <HI>&s;even years,</HI> in the xxxi&s;t chap. was the <HI>&s;ame</HI> which they had before done in the plains of <HI>Moab,</HI> mentioned in the xxixth. If the <HI>latter</HI> was a publick renewal of covenant with God, &s;o was the <HI>former;</HI> for it is plainly &s;poken of as a repetition of what they had &s;o &s;olemnly tran&s;acted in the fore|mentioned place. Whence it appears, that none, among that people, had grown up to &s;uch an age, as to have occa&s;ion to circumci&s;e their children, but they had before, per&s;onally and explicitly entered into covenant with God.</P>
<P>As to the other part of the objection, that they were not all <HI>graci|ous per&s;ons,</HI> who brought their children to be circumci&s;ed; I would ob&s;erve, 'Tis mo&s;t probable, yea, there is no doubt, many of them did come to this ordinance in a <HI>hypocritical</HI> manner&mdash;did externally covenant with God, and &s;eal their covenant when they had no true love to the God of ISRAEL. It is very certain, that in many periods of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> &s;tate, the greater part of the people were notoriou&s;ly wicked, gro&s;sly hypocritical&mdash;fell into &s;candalous idolatry: In&s;omuch that God &s;peaks of them in general, and calls them a <HI>hypocritical nation,</HI> and the <HI>people of his wrath,</HI> I&s;ai. x. 6. But will any one argue from all this, that they had <HI>a right</HI> to come to God's ordinances in the manner they did&mdash;or that God ALLOWED THEM to come with &s;uch a character, much le&s;s, <HI>commanded</HI> them? Will any per|&s;on rea&s;on after &s;uch a &s;trange &s;ort as this; that becau&s;e the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> were commanded to attend the <HI>Sacraments,</HI> and many of 'em at|tended them in abominable hypocri&s;y&mdash;therefore <HI>we</HI> may do &s;o like|wi&s;e? And becau&s;e they <HI>flattered</HI> GOD <HI>with their mouth, and</HI> LIED <HI>to him with their tongue,</HI> therefore 'tis lawful for <HI>us</HI> to do the &s;ame now? This would be, indeed, a &s;urprizing way of arguing. God did enjoin that people, 'tis true, to <HI>circumci&s;e</HI> their children and eat the pa&s;&s;over, on penalty of exci&s;ion; But it does not follow from hence, that God enjoined or allowed them to do it in an <HI>ungracious,</HI> hypocritical man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r. Therefore it mu&s;t be acknowledged, to the honor of the divine purity, that tho&s;e <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> had <HI>no right</HI> to at|tend tho&s;e ordinances, in the manner that multitudes of them did.</P>
<P>But furthermore&mdash;It may be ob&s;erved, that this objection, taken from the <HI>Jewi&s;h church,</HI> does militate full as much again&s;t tho&s;e that make it, as again&s;t us. For <HI>they</HI> hold, that none have a right to come
<PB N="19" REF="012984_0025_0F903E5CC6C7EE70">to <HI>either</HI> ordinance, but &s;uch as are free from <HI>&s;candal.</HI> But it is cer|tain, as before ob&s;erved, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> va&s;t numbers among the <HI>Jews,</HI> attended their Sacraments, without <HI>this</HI> qualification; when they were &s;canda|lou&s;ly <HI>immoral,</HI> and lived in open wickedne&s;s and idolatry. How con|tinually were they falling into that &s;in? and yet we have no account, at &s;uch times, of their leaving off circumci&s;ion or the pa&s;&s;over. So that, for per&s;ons to plead, that the Jews were <HI>expre&s;sly commanded</HI> to attend the&s;e ordinances, and therefore might do it <HI>without gracious &s;ince|rity</HI>&mdash;or to urge that true holine&s;s was not what God required of them, becau&s;e the command was &s;o <HI>univer&s;al;</HI> if of any weight here, will, in the end, prove every whit as much again&s;t <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> as again&s;t <HI>us;</HI> viz. That God did not require, &s;o much as <HI>moral hone&s;ty,</HI> or freedom from &s;candal, in tho&s;e that came to his ordinances. For there is no more exception, in the divine command, in one ca&s;e, than in the other. The truth undoubtedly, is, though God did <HI>command</HI> them to attend on the&s;e duties, yet he never commanded them to do it in a <HI>gracele&s;s hypocritical</HI> manner. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould&mdash;it would be incon&s;i&s;tent with the infinite, unchangeable holine&s;s and per|fection of his nature, to do it. Therefore, what <HI>they actually did,</HI> is no rule by which we are to judge what was <HI>right;</HI> but <HI>what God commanded.</HI></P>

Whether tho&s;e that he baptized, were all true penitents or not, ('tis
<PB N="22" REF="012984_0028_0F903E5F14DC7058">plain &s;ome of 'em were not,) yet this was what they <HI>profe&s;&s;ed,</HI> and upon <HI>this</HI> profe&s;&s;ion, he baptized them.

<P>As to the <HI>numbers</HI> that went to John to be baptized&mdash;<HI>All Judea and Jeru&s;alem;</HI> by the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, 'tis plain nothing more is meant, than that there was a <HI>great re&s;ort,</HI> much people from tho&s;e places, that went out to him.

However dark the pro&s;pect may be, and however great our concern for our children, yet we may be &s;ure of this, that 'tis not the right way, to get rid of this evil, to go out of the rules which Chri&s;t has given us with re&s;pect to bapti&s;m. Neither can we expect a ble&s;&s;ing, either on us or them, if we &s;hould <HI>do evil that good may come;</HI> or if we &s;hould be guilty of di&s;&s;imulation and hypocri&s;y, in order to get our children baptized; as that per&s;on mu&s;t be, who &s;olemnly <HI>covenants</HI> with God, when he has not &s;uch an heart in him.</P>

There is no rea&s;on to expect, but that &s;uch children, <HI>ordinarily &s;peaking,</HI> will grow up in irreligion, whether they are baptized or not. And for per&s;ons to go about with the <HI>name</HI> and vi&s;ible <HI>&s;eal</HI> of God, and the &s;acred badge of chri&s;|tianity upon them, having had their <HI>bodies,</HI> by a holy ordinance, con&s;ecrated to God as his temples, yet living in irreligion and ways of wickedne&s;s, this tends exceedingly to harden them and e&s;tabli&s;h them in an habitual contempt of &s;acred things. Such per&s;ons, above all men, are like to be the mo&s;t hardened and abandoned, and mo&s;t difficultly reclaimed. As it was with the wicked <HI>Jews,</HI> who were
<PB N="27" REF="012984_0033_0F903E665172A4F0">much more confirmed in their wickedne&s;s, than tho&s;e heathen cities of <HI>Tyre</HI> and <HI>Sidon.</HI> To give that which is holy to tho&s;e whom we have no manner of rea&s;on to expect, (from the circum&s;tances of their parentage and education) will be any otherwi&s;e than profane and irre|ligious, is not the way to make them <HI>better</HI> but <HI>wor&s;e.</HI> 'Tis the way to make them habitually trample holy things under their feet, yea, even to <HI>turn again and rent us,</HI> and be more mi&s;chievous and hurtful enemies to that which is good than otherwi&s;e they would be."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edwards's Enquity, <HI>P. 127.</HI></NOTE></P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION IV.</HI> More particular Remarks on Mr. Cotton's E&s;&s;ays.</HEAD>
<P>I Can't but ob&s;erve that Mr. C. in the greater part of his e&s;&s;ays, &s;eems to have entirely lo&s;t &s;ight of the que&s;tion which was fir&s;t propo&s;ed, and which is the ground of the debate. The que&s;tion, as he has rightly &s;tated it in the beginning of his book, was, "Whether the half way practice of admitting per&s;ons to own the covenant and have bapti&s;m for their children, <HI>without coming to the Lord's Supper,</HI> be warrantable by the word of God." Mr. C. undertook to prove
<PB N="29" REF="012984_0035_0F903E6979092688">the <HI>affirmative.</HI> Had he done this, from the word of God, he would have e&s;tabli&s;hed his point, and I mu&s;t and would have freely given it up. But the attentive reader will ea&s;ily ob&s;erve, that in a very little while after he had fir&s;t &s;tated th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> que&s;tion, he goes off, to endeavour to prove <HI>another point,</HI> viz. that per&s;ons who are <HI>unregenerate,</HI> (if baptized) have a lawful right to bring <HI>their children</HI> to bapti&s;m; and that their coming, in &s;uch circum&s;tances, (if outwardly regular,) would be <HI>le&s;s offen&s;ive to God than the omi&s;&s;ion would be.</HI> That it is not their being <HI>gracious</HI> per&s;ons, that the church is to have re&s;pect to, in admitting them, but their being <HI>baptized,</HI> and &s;o in vi&s;ible co|venant&mdash;and that this gives them the <HI>right,</HI> whether they are gracious or no. This appears from tho&s;e words of his, in the 2d page "Neither does CHRIST &s;o much as intimate that they were <HI>gracious</HI>&mdash;thereby letting us know, that it is vi&s;ible member&s;hip gives the <HI>right.</HI>" i. e. Such a member&s;hip as a per&s;on may have, without any need of the &s;uppo&s;ition of his being <HI>truly gracious.</HI> For the drift of his whole argument is to prove that <HI>unregenerate</HI> per&s;ons me <HI>compleat members</HI> of the church, (if baptized and regular) &s;o as to give them a lawful right to ordinances. And he mu&s;t mean a right in the <HI>&s;ight of God,</HI> as well as the church; for he &s;ays, p. 12. "From this we infer that it <HI>is not contrary to the mind of</HI> GOD, that the children of <HI>per&s;ons unregenerate</HI> &s;hould have this ordinance admini|&s;tred to them, if their parents be in covenant relation to God." And indeed, that this is a point Mr. C. holds, is evident not only from a multitude of pa&s;&s;ages all over his book, but from his appearing in op|po&s;ition to my declared &s;entiments in this matter. There would be no room or foundation for oppo&s;ing me here, if he was not of the principle above. For I have always held that we have nothing to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to judge <HI>hearts,</HI> or to in&s;i&s;t that they <HI>&s;hall certainly be gracious,</HI> or el&s;e not be admitted; far from it; we may, and often are deceived no doubt. But if per&s;ons <HI>profe&s;e</HI> to be real friends to Chri&s;t, and appear to be <HI>&s;incere</HI> in what they profe&s;s, and their lives are agreea|ble, they are to be received, not only to Bapti&s;m, but to <HI>all</HI> the priviledges of vi&s;ible &s;aints. Whereas Mr. C. &s;uppo&s;es, according to his book, that it is lawful for <HI>gracele&s;s</HI> per&s;ons <HI>as &s;uch,</HI> to come to this ordinance, own the covenant, &amp;c. and that, there is no nece&s;&s;ity of their <HI>being</HI> gracious, or <HI>profe&s;&s;ing</HI> grace, in order to give them a right. Otherwi&s;e he could not &s;ay, "'Tis the <HI>will of God,</HI>" they &s;hould come, provided they have been baptized; or that &s;uch <HI>pro|fe&s;&s;ion</HI> is " only a <HI>prudential</HI> of the church."</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="012984_0036_0F903E69A6014750">
And yet &s;trangely, Mr. C. &s;eems to hold, in many other places, <HI>that</HI> which is directly contradictory to this. As in p. 30, 65, &amp;c. of which, more hereafter. But it is evident from what has been ob&s;erved, that Mr. C. has for&s;aken the <HI>original</HI> que&s;tion, which was&mdash;not whether <HI>unregenerate parents</HI> have a right to bring their chil|dren; but whether 'tis warrantable from &s;cripture for per&s;ons to <HI>own the covenant</HI> and be admitted to the priviledge of bapti&s;m for their children, (thereby treating them as vi&s;ible &s;aints) while they <HI>neglect to attend the other ordinance.</HI> It was <HI>his</HI> going off from the point in controver&s;y, that obliged me, in the cour&s;e of our debates at the church meetings, to an&s;wer &s;ome objections and bring &s;undry argu|ments to prove the <HI>unlawfulne&s;s</HI> of unregenerate men's partaking of covenant priviledges; for which Mr. C. has charged me with "<HI>mi&s;|&s;tating</HI> the que&s;tion," p. 65. And tells me, with an air, rather &s;uited to his <HI>magi&s;tratical</HI> than <HI>brotherly</HI> character, "Wherefore I de&s;ire to hear no more about <HI>qualifications.</HI>" But if per&s;ons will them|&s;elves <HI>ramble</HI> from the point, I know of no other way but to <HI>ramble</HI> after 'em. But I will now invite Mr. C. back again, and endeavour for a while to attend to the que&s;tion we &s;et out upon; and con&s;ider what he has &s;aid upon it; and whether any arguments he has bro't, when weighed in the <HI>ballance of the &s;anctuary,</HI> will appear of &s;uffi|cient weight to e&s;tabli&s;h what he undertook to prove.</P>
<P>His arguments &s;eem to be chiefly founded on the parents being <HI>compleat members</HI> of the church, <HI>in good &s;tanding.</HI> He owns that notwith&s;tanding their <HI>member&s;hip</HI> by bapti&s;m, they may be guilty of that which <HI>di&s;qualifies</HI> them for enjoying bapti&s;m for their children. That by their unchri&s;tian conduct and behavior they may <HI>forfeit</HI> their right. He holds, in many places, that none have the right, but <HI>vi&s;ible chri&s;tians</HI> or <HI>believers,</HI> p. 70, &amp;c. that is, tho&s;e that <HI>profe&s;s</HI> and <HI>appear</HI> to be <HI>real</HI> chri&s;tians, <HI>true</HI> believers.</P>
<P>Now it is granted that per&s;ons baptized in infancy, are thereby initiated into the vi&s;ible church of Chri&s;t, and have a proper <HI>member|&s;hip</HI> in it; and as &s;uch, have a <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> title to the ordinances and priviledges of &s;uch, provided they behave like chri&s;tians and do not exclude them&s;elves by their unchri&s;tian conduct; or in other words, as long as they appear to act <HI>agreeable to the import of their bapti&s;|mal covenant engagements;</HI> or do not practically renounce them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. C. &s;ugge&s;ts, in his preface and el&s;ewhere, that I had formerly <HI>allowed,</HI> but now <HI>denied</HI> the member&s;hip of infants. This is &s;o contrary to the truth of fact, that it mu&s;t have ari&s;en from his <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;apprebending</HI> my meaping; not from any wilful de&s;ign, I tru&s;t.

I can &s;ee no &s;ort of propriety or <HI>meaning</HI> in Infant Bapti&s;m, &s;hould this be denied. Therefore 'tis unaccountable to me, how Mr. C. could under&s;tand me in the light he did. I believe, and ever have believed that they have a proper member&s;hip thro' means, or on account of their relation to their vi&s;ibly believing parents. But what I <HI>denied</HI> and do &s;till, is that bapti&s;m makes them members in <HI>&s;uch</HI> a manner, as to give them a go&s;pel right to covenant priviledges, <HI>whether they</HI> (when adult) <HI>make a profe&s;&s;ion of godline&s;s and be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> agreeably to their covenant engagements or not.</HI></NOTE>

<P>Again; tho&s;e words of CHRIST in <HI>Luk.</HI> vi. 46. are directly again&s;t &s;uch claims.

<PB N="35" REF="012984_0041_0F903E6D5DB0E808">This would be a very dangerous doctrine.

<P N="1">1. That we find <HI>no warrant</HI> for &s;uch a di&s;tinction or exception, in the word of God, let the plea for it be what it will. Is it not probable we &s;hould have had &s;ome intimation of it from CHRIST or his Apo&s;tles, if there had been any <HI>rea&s;onable grounds</HI> for &s;uch an excu&s;e for neglecting a plain in&s;titution of Chri&s;t? Whence comes it to pa&s;s, that we never find, in the New Te&s;tament, any account of di&s;ciples excu&s;ing them&s;elves from this command of Chri&s;t, from <HI>&s;cruples of con&s;cience?</HI> I can't find that this was ever tho't to be a &s;ufficient ground, till &s;ince the Apo&s;tles days; perhaps not till within 200 years, for admitting per&s;ons to the number and priviledges of <HI>di&s;ciples,</HI> who lived in the neglect of that di&s;tingui&s;hing command of Chri&s;t. Have we not rea&s;on then, to look upon this, not of divine approbation, but as an invention of men, to palliate, if not to excu&s;e per&s;ons, in their di&s;obedience to the commands of Chri&s;t, while yet they may pa&s;s for his di&s;ciples and goods chri&s;tians?</P>
<P N="2">2. But what are the&s;e <HI>&s;cruples of con&s;cience,</HI> which will &s;uffer a per&s;on to engage in the mo&s;t &s;olemn tran&s;action in the world, (as they do when they <HI>own the covenant</HI>) and yet will keep him back from the <HI>Lord's Supper,</HI> a plain in&s;tituted ordinance of Chri&s;t? Is there not rea&s;on to think, at lea&s;t in many in&s;tances, that the&s;e <HI>"&s;cruples"</HI> are in reality, an inward con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that all is not right within; a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their unfitne&s;s for &s;uch a covenant tran&s;action? or that they are &s;atisfied in them&s;elves, however the church may have charity for 'em, that they have no true love to JESUS CHRIST; that they
<PB N="36" REF="012984_0042_0F903E6E31CB96D0">are in a &s;tate of polluted nature.&mdash;Yet, &s;ince there is &s;uch a practice in the church as <HI>owning the covenant</HI> without coming to the Lord's Supper, they will venture to comply with it, for the &s;ake of their <HI>children;</HI> hoping &s;ecretly, all the while, that it is not really the <HI>co|venant of grace</HI> that they <HI>own;</HI> nor of the &s;ame nature, in point of obligation, with that covenant which per&s;ons make, when they come up to <HI>full communion.</HI> Is there not great rea&s;on to fear this is truly the ca&s;e with many, in tho&s;e places where this practice is upheld?&mdash;Which leads me to &s;ay,</P>
<P N="3">3. If they do not <HI>&s;cruple</HI> to do the <HI>greater,</HI> why &s;hould they &s;cruple to do the <HI>le&s;s?</HI> Their tender con&s;ciences won't &s;cruple to <HI>own the covenant,</HI> which is one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f the greate&s;t and mo&s;t &s;olemn tran&s;actions a per&s;on can perform on this &s;ide death and the eternal world.

It may al&s;o be enquired,</P>
<P N="4">4. Why the&s;e fears and <HI>&s;cruples</HI> don't operate as &s;trong to keep him away from <HI>one</HI> ordinance, as from the <HI>other,</HI> equally &s;olemn and important; and to the right attendance on which, love to CHRIST is as much required? There is as much a profe&s;&s;ion of love to CHRIST, and as much of a covenant tran&s;action in a per&s;on's offering his child to God in <HI>bapti&s;m,</HI> as in his coming to the <HI>Lord's table.</HI> And if any parents think otherwi&s;e, they are greatly mi&s;taken. Therefore &s;hould they per&s;i&s;t in pleading <HI>&s;cruples of con&s;cience</HI> for neglecting the ordinance of the Lord's Supper, while yet they demand Bapti&s;m for their children, will not &s;uch gro&s;s <HI>incon&s;i&s;tence</HI> &s;hew, either that they are too ignorant of the <HI>nature</HI> of Bapti&s;m and the import of it, to be admitted to bapti&s;m for their children, until better in&s;tructed; or el&s;e, that they do not act from any love to CHRIST in in&s;i&s;ting upon it; but from &s;ome worldly views, &s;uch as the honor and credit of it, or &s;ome other &s;ini&s;ter motive?

<P><HI>Obj.</HI> But is there not &s;ome allowance to be made for weak, tender rainds? All can't &s;ee alike.

<PB N="38" REF="012984_0044_0F903E6FC0175890">&s;ome of it. And may'nt there be <HI>real</HI> good chri&s;tians, that may be under the&s;e &s;cruples?

<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> I am far from &s;uppo&s;ing this impo&s;&s;ible. I doubt not it has often been the ca&s;e.

I cannot but think, that if mini&s;ters would be painful in declaring what is the truth in this matter, and determine no longer to &s;ubmit to a practice, which them&s;elves, many of them, acknowledge carries in it an incon&s;i&s;tency; and if churches would join in aboli&s;hing this un&s;criptural <HI>practice,</HI> which has tended &s;o much (I &s;peak from my own knowledge) to mi&s;lead and bewilder hone&s;t, enquiring minds with re&s;pect to <HI>covenanting</HI> with God, there is no doubt but the prejudices and &s;cruples of all hone&s;t, con&s;cientious per&s;ons would &s;oon be removed; and they would &s;ee that they might as <HI>&s;afely</HI> come to the <HI>Lord's table</HI> as offer up a child to God in <HI>Bapti&s;m;</HI> or it would be as difficult to per&s;wade them to come to the <HI>latter</HI> as the <HI>former.</HI></P>

This was the <HI>Synod</HI> s plan; and this is what has been the occa&s;ion, (tho' contrary to their de&s;ign) of &s;uch a melancholly pro&s;titution of that holy ordinance of Bapti&s;m, in &s;o many places; where <HI>owning the covenant,</HI> is dwindled into a mere piece of formality, and per&s;ons are allowed to bring their children to bapti&s;m, who don't &s;o much as look upon them&s;elves to be real chri&s;|tians, true di&s;ciples of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. That <HI>Synod,</HI> who were a num|ber of godly and excellent men, no doubt, little thought this would be the con&s;equence of their agreement. It is evident that they had no notion of pleading the lawfulne&s;s of "unregenerate &s;inners coming" to <HI>that,</HI> or either of the ordinances; or that they would "&s;in more in &s;taying away than in coming." For Dr. <HI>I. Mather,</HI> who was at la&s;t, full in the <HI>Synod</HI>'s plan, has the&s;e remarkable words, "It is only a <HI>ju&s;tifying faith</HI> which giveth right to bapti&s;m before God, &s;o it is the profe&s;&s;ion or <HI>vi&s;ibility</HI> of <HI>this faith</HI> which giveth right before
<PB N="41" REF="012984_0047_0F903E7250A594D8">the church." And again, "If he doth not <HI>con&s;ent with</HI> HIS HEART that this God &s;hall be his God, he hath no right to Bapti&s;m." The reader may now judge whether Mr. C. has or has not warped off from the &s;entiments and original de&s;ign of the <HI>Synod,</HI> while he a&s;&s;erts the lawfulne&s;s of unregenerates coming to this ordinance, and that "we have <HI>no bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> to prevent their coming, becau&s;e the ordinance is often ble&s;t to tho&s;e in &s;tate of unregeneracy."</P>

<P>TRUTH is always &s;elf con&s;i&s;tent.

Whether Mr. C. has not fallen into this difficulty in attempting to &s;upport his &s;cheme, I &s;hall, after pointing out a few things, leave the reader to judge.</P>
<P>'Tis evident from all Mr. C.'s e&s;&s;ay, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the grand point he is aiming at is to prove that it is lawful for per&s;ons that have been bap|tized and are not &s;candalous, to own the covenant and have bapti&s;m for their children, tho' they neglect to come up to the other ordi|nance; and that churches ought to admit them to the former, tho' they refu&s;e the latter. That is, the church ought to <HI>di&s;pen&s;e,</HI> (at lea&s;t for the pre&s;ent) with the parents omi&s;&s;ion of the Lord's &s;upper; tho' he acknowledges it a commanded duty to all di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t. And yet in p. 22d, in an&s;we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to an <HI>expedient</HI> which I had propo&s;ed, (which was this, "If per&s;ons mu&s;t be borne with, on account of their <HI>&s;cruples</HI> about the other ordinance, I prop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e that they &s;hould own the covenant, profe&s;s their faith, and let the church <HI>receive them</HI> as mem|bers <HI>in full;</HI> not half members; and then let their children be bap|tized, tho' their <HI>&s;cruples</HI> detained them <HI>for the pre&s;ent,</HI> from the Lord's table") I &s;ay, Mr. C. in an&s;wer to this, &s;ays, "This I look upon to be a right <HI>popi&s;h di&s;pen&s;ation,</HI> di&s;pen&s;ing with the command of God, which is one of the <HI>wor&s;t things</HI> we charge upon the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI>" And yet, Mr. C. to e&s;tabli&s;h the lawfulne&s;s of this very <HI>popi&s;h di&s;pen&s;ation,</HI> has wrote a whole book: For he owns it is a
<PB N="42" REF="012984_0048_0F903E72CCA76CF8"><HI>command</HI> of Chri&s;t to <HI>all</HI> his vi&s;ible di&s;ciples, <HI>Do this in remem|brance of me;</HI> yet the <HI>whole plan</HI> he is upon, pleads the lawful|ne&s;s of <HI>di&s;pen&s;ing</HI> with this command.</P>
<P>Mr. C. abundantly a&s;&s;ert that baptized per&s;ons are <HI>real</HI> members&mdash;<HI>compleat</HI> members of the church, in good &s;tanding, &amp;c. and that they are vi&s;ible chri&s;tians, p. 27. and many other places. Yet in p. 29. he in effect calls them a "carnal generation," who would "ru&s;h into the church as the hor&s;e to the battle," if they were not allowed to own the covenant and have their children baptized, without coming to the Lord's table. To &s;ay, that he only means <HI>&s;candalous</HI> per&s;ons, by that <HI>carnal generation,</HI> would be but a mere eva&s;ion. For none ever plead the lawfulne&s;s of <HI>&s;uch</HI> coming to either ordinance. So that, it &s;eems, tho&s;e who, in one breath, are called "vi&s;ible believers, <HI>di&s;ciples,</HI> compleat members"&mdash;are in the next, "a carnal generation," and therefore be&s;t they &s;hould be kept together by them&s;elves, by keeping up the <HI>half way</HI> practice, lea&s;t they &s;hould, to get their chil|dren baptized, <HI>"ru&s;h in"</HI> among the communicants. And what is fur|ther remarkable, Mr. C. owns he &s;hould be willing to receive the&s;e very per&s;ons into communion. For he has repeatedly &s;aid, when a&s;ked <HI>why the church will not admit them in full?</HI> "The church would wil|lingly do it, but the difficulty lies in <HI>their own brea&s;ts,</HI> not in ours."</P>
<P>Mr. C. allows, as has been ob&s;erved, that no per&s;on ought to come to <HI>either</HI> ordinance, un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> he is a <HI>vi&s;ible believer,</HI> p. 27. 65. He al&s;o grants, p. 30, "that it is <HI>real grace</HI> that entitles to the ordi|nance in the &s;ight of God, and <HI>vi&s;ible grace</HI>&mdash;in the &s;ight of the Church." Therefore if we have not &s;ome &s;atisfying evidence that a per&s;on is <HI>gracious</HI> in a judgment of &s;criptural charity, he ought not to be allowed Bapti&s;m for his child. And el&s;ewhere, that if a per&s;on knows he has no gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e he has no right to offer him&s;elf to renew co|venant. And yet he &s;ays p. 12, "It is not contrary to the mind of God that children of per&s;ons <HI>unregenerate</HI> &s;hould have this ordi|nance admini&s;tered to them, if in covenant relation to him." If the unregenerate have <HI>to right</HI> in the <HI>&s;ight of God,</HI> as he ju&s;t now acknow|ledged, then pray what &s;ort of <HI>"covenant relation"</HI> is that, which gives them a right, while unregenerate? He holds al&s;o, that per&s;ons who are admi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ted to this priviledge, mu&s;t have a <HI>vi&s;ibility of grace,</HI> i. e. mu&s;t be received as <HI>vi&s;ibly regenerate,</HI> Yet in p. 17. he &s;ays, "Why &s;hould we be &s;o anxions to exclude every <HI>unregenerate</HI> per|&s;on from this &s;eal?" And that they are <HI>le&s;s &s;inful,</HI> and offend God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">th in <HI>coming</HI> than in &s;taying away. (p. 4. 68.)</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="012984_0049_0F903E78D4517A20">
Yea Mr. C. advances that, in his zeal for this practice, which de|&s;troys all di&s;tinction between &s;aints and &s;inners, vi&s;ible chri&s;tians and &s;candalous per&s;ons; and which gives the children of <HI>all,</HI> a right to bapti&s;m, independant of the character of their parents. So that there &s;eems to be no nece&s;&s;ity of their being &s;o much as <HI>moral</HI> in order to have their children baptized. For he &s;ays, p. 19. "The children's member&s;hip is a <HI>di&s;tinct thing</HI> from that of their parents;&mdash;and to puni&s;h <HI>them</HI> becau&s;e their <HI>parents</HI> do not immediately come to the Lord's table is <HI>hard</HI> and <HI>injurious.</HI>" i. e. (if there is any argu|ment or meaning in the expre&s;&s;ions) As the member&s;hip of <HI>children</HI> does not depend on the character or conduct of the <HI>parent,</HI> or <HI>his</HI> member&s;hip, they ought to be baptized, let the <HI>parent</HI> be what he will. The <HI>child</HI> has a right to the ordinance, becau&s;e it has a compleat, <HI>di&s;tinct member&s;hip</HI> of <HI>its own;</HI> therefore 'tis "hard and injurious to puni&s;h the child" by denying it bapti&s;m, becau&s;e the <HI>parent</HI> is of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;candalous character.</P>
<P>In p. 16 and 17, Mr. C. has a number of particulars, &s;hewing in what re&s;pects bapti&s;m is a <HI>&s;eal.</HI> And among other things &s;ays, "Bapti&s;m &s;eals <HI>&s;aving ble&s;&s;ings</HI> to the <HI>unregenerate</HI> conditionally." 'Tis not ea&s;y to find out what he means by this expre&s;&s;ion. If he means that tho&s;e who are baptized have this truth confirmed to them. that <HI>if they believe</HI> they &s;hall <HI>be &s;aved;</HI> 'tis no more than what all <HI>unbaptized</HI> per&s;ons enjoy, who live under the go&s;pel and have their bibles. If he means, God has <HI>bound him&s;elf</HI> by <HI>covenant</HI> to be&s;tow &s;aving ble&s;&s;ings on tho&s;e that comply with the <HI>conditions</HI> of the cove|nant; in this &s;en&s;e, all mankind are in covenant with God. He may be &s;aid to have <HI>bound him&s;elf to them</HI> ALL, <HI>conditionally,</HI> whether baptized or unbaptized, Jews, Dei&s;ts or Mahometans, if they have heard of the go&s;pel. For the go&s;pel confirms and proclaims that truth to all the world, <HI>He that believeth &s;hall he &s;aved.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame kind of confu&s;ion, it appears to me, there is in his idea or de&s;cription of a <HI>&s;eal</HI> in p. 67, with which word, he &s;ays, "People are &s;o continually <HI>dinned</HI> and <HI>drowned.</HI>" It certainly &s;eems as if this, or &s;omething el&s;e, has had this effect upon his mind, if we attend to his account of a <HI>&s;eal</HI> in this place. He &s;ays fir&s;t, "<HI>Prayer</HI> is a <HI>&s;eal</HI> of the covenant of grace." And how does he prove this? why thus; or to this effect; becau&s;e true believers, when in the exerci&s;e of faith, &s;ay in prayer, <HI>Our Father which art in heaven,</HI> (for none el&s;e can &s;ay it in the manner he there &s;peaks of) they &s;et to their <HI>&s;eal</HI> that God is <HI>their father.</HI> Therefore <HI>unregenerats</HI> men may <HI>&s;eal</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="012984_0050_0F903E7A5FF9F190">the covenant of grace, becau&s;e 'tis lawful for &s;uch to <HI>pray.</HI> For this is the drift of his argument here, as appears by his &s;aying, a little after, "Mu&s;t then all <HI>unregenerate</HI> men be debar'd from the&s;e or|dinances?" He &s;ays further, "<HI>Hearing</HI> is a <HI>&s;eal,</HI>" by this he means <HI>that</HI> hearing which the unregenerate are capable of; for he is &s;peak|ing of this, as an ordinance which none are to be "debar'd" from. And what is his proof of this? 'Tis in the&s;e words, "Becau&s;e when we <HI>heartily believe</HI> the truths delivered, we &s;et to our <HI>&s;eal</HI> that God is true," i. e. becau&s;e <HI>&s;aving faith</HI> &s;eals the truth of the go&s;pel, there|fore <HI>hearing</HI> the word is a <HI>&s;eal.</HI> Or becau&s;e true believers in <HI>hearing</HI> the word, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ix faith</HI> with it, and &s;o <HI>&s;et to their &s;eal that God is true,</HI> therefore <HI>hearing,</HI> without faith, (as all <HI>unregenerates</HI> do) is a <HI>&s;eal</HI> likewi&s;e. I think this mu&s;t be the meaning of the words, if there is any meaning to them. For he is here &s;hewing what ordinances un|regenerate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ners <HI>may</HI> lawfully u&s;e, viz. Prayer, hearing, &amp;c. and from thence argues the lawfulne&s;s of their coming to &s;ealing ordi|nances, particularly <HI>Bapti&s;m;</HI> &s;ince other ordinances are <HI>&s;eals,</HI> equally with this. I would not willingly pervert his &s;en&s;e. But if this is not the purport of what he &s;ays here, I confe&s;s my&s;elf totally at a lo&s;s for his meaning.</P>
<P>To the &s;ame purpo&s;e he adds, "<HI>reading</HI> is a &s;eal," and to prove it, &s;ays, they that "<HI>apply</HI> the law or go&s;pel to their &s;ouls (this mu&s;t be by faith) <HI>&s;eal</HI> the truth of it." Therefore, the inference mu&s;t be this, as the unregenerate ought not to be "debared" from <HI>reading;</HI> &s;o they ought to be allowed <HI>bapti&s;m;</HI> as one is no more a <HI>&s;eal</HI> than the other. If there be any weight in &s;uch kind of rea&s;oning, it certainly proves that all &s;orts of men, good and bad, even the mo&s;t &s;candalous &s;inners living, have a right to the ordinance of bapti&s;m. For none will deny that &s;uch may lawfully <HI>read</HI> and <HI>hear the word.</HI></P>
<P>But let us attend a little further to his manner of arguing in p. 18. He in&s;i&s;ts, that if <HI>grace</HI> be nece&s;&s;ary in order to per&s;ons lawfully com|ing to ordinances, then a per&s;on has no right to come, unle&s;s he has <HI>a&s;&s;urance,</HI> or <HI>knows</HI> he has grace. And if he has this, he &s;ays, in another place, <HI>what need he come at all.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. C. in various parts of his book, e&s;pecially in p. 10, &s;eems to entertain very &s;trange notions about <HI>a&s;&s;urance:</HI> That per&s;ons, as &s;oon as they have arrived to a <HI>full a&s;&s;urance,</HI> are then come to a <HI>&s;lop.</HI> As if the grand point, the <HI>main thing</HI> that God and man are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">im<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng at, and for which <HI>ordinances</HI> were appointed, was to a&s;certain the per&s;on of <HI>his own &s;afe &s;tate;</HI> and that this once obtained, there is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> growth. Hence he &s;ays, "if we have this (a&s;&s;urance) <HI>before</HI> we come, what need we come at all? at lea&s;t we need not come&mdash;to get our evidences and comforts &s;trengthened. "It appears to me, that by what Mr. C. has wrote upon <HI>a&s;&s;urance,</HI> in this performance, he has very <HI>low</HI> and <HI>unworthy</HI> conceptions of the nature and tendency of this precious grace: And that what he has advanced, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> unfound, and really of dangerous tendency. Is it not evident from &s;cripture, that the <HI>end and de&s;ign</HI> of GOD, in be&s;towing <HI>this grace</HI> upon believers, is to give a clearer manife&s;tation of the glory of his perfections, particularly of his <HI>love</HI> and <HI>grace</HI> in CHRIST, that the &s;oul may, <HI>by beholding his glory,</HI> be more conformed to God, more quickened to duty, more than ever engaged in the love and &s;ervice of God, and in a con&s;tant, <HI>cheerful</HI> obedience to all his commandments and <HI>ordi|nances;</HI> in a word, that he may hereby be enlarged to <HI>run the way of God's commands;</HI> and better fitted for his attendance on <HI>all</HI> the duties of the chri&s;tian life? Surely the &s;oul, when it has obtained &s;uch precious manife&s;tations&mdash;when GOD has given it an <HI>a&s;&s;urance</HI> of his love, is far, very far from thinking that at "<HI>need not come at all</HI> to the Lord's Supper;" or that it needs no further <HI>&s;trength|ning</HI> or <HI>comfort.</HI> For the more the &s;oul knows and enjoys of God, the more its <HI>capa|cities</HI> are enlarged, its <HI>love</HI> en&s;lamed, its <HI>de&s;ires</HI> increa&s;ed, and the per&s;on <HI>&s;trength|ned</HI> both for duty and &s;ufferings.

And yet in p. 30, he holds that <HI>grace,</HI> "real grace" is nece&s;&s;ary; and that no per&s;on has a right in the &s;ight of God, without it. Nay, what has al|ways appeared very &s;trange and incon&s;i&s;tent to me is, that it is well known to be Mr. C.'s <HI>profe&s;&s;ed principle,</HI> that no per&s;on &s;hould come to the <HI>Lord's Supper,</HI> but tho&s;e that are <HI>converted.</HI> So that it is certain, this <HI>"dead weight"</HI> lies full as heavy on <HI>him&s;elf</HI> as on <HI>us.</HI> Let him tell how he gets from under it him&s;elf, and he will remove it from us.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It has always been &s;urprizing to me, that any &s;hould boa&s;t of this as an invinci|ble argument again&s;t us; when, if it has any weight, it falls as heavy on <HI>every</HI> &s;cheme, even their own, as on ours. For on <HI>every</HI> plan, &s;ome <HI>mental,</HI> inward qualifications are in&s;i&s;ted on as nece&s;&s;ary to give a right to &s;ealing ordinances. According to them, no per&s;on, therefore, mu&s;t come to either ordinance, till he ab&s;olutely <HI>knows,</HI> and is <HI>a&s;&s;ured</HI> he has that qualification; let it be moral &s;incerity, or whatever. But do they ever require this <HI>ab&s;olute knowledge?</HI> If a per&s;on comes and tells them, that as far as he knows his own heart, after careful ex|amination, he <HI>thinks and believes he has</HI> that qualification; will they turn him away, becau&s;e he is not ab&s;olutely <HI>certain</HI> he has it? They mu&s;t do it, according to their argument. The truth of this matter undoubtedly is this. To <HI>confe&s;s</HI> Chri&s;t before men and come to the <HI>Lord's Supper,</HI> is a <HI>commanded duty</HI> for every <HI>true di&s;ciple</HI> of Chri&s;t, and none el&s;e; according to <HI>Luke</HI> xxii. 19. To ab&s;tain from this, if I am <HI>in heart</HI> a friend to Chri&s;t, is <HI>&s;in.</HI> To do it in hypocri&s;y, is al&s;o <HI>&s;in.</HI> Therefore in &s;uch a ca&s;e, a man's con&s;cience will lead him to act according to his prevailing judgment. He is obliged to do &s;o. Mankind ever do thus, in all doubtful matters. The rea&s;on why there appears any weight at all in this objection, is doubtle&s;s this; Men are apt to con&s;ider the Lord's Supper as a <HI>Pri|viledge</HI> only, and not a <HI>Duty.</HI> If it were only a <HI>Priviledge,</HI> which I am allowed to take, upon certain <HI>qualifications</HI> in me; and forbidden, if I had <HI>not</HI> tho&s;e qua|lifications; In &s;uch a ca&s;e, it would certainly be &s;afe&s;t for me to ab&s;tain, till I <HI>know</HI> I have the qualifications. But &s;uppo&s;ing I am &s;trictly <HI>commanded</HI> and en|joined by God, to take, if I <HI>have</HI> tho&s;e qualifications; then it is equally dange|rous to <HI>neglect</HI> on uncertainties as to <HI>take</HI> on uncertainties. The danger is equal both ways. If the que&s;tion were only what I have a <HI>right to,</HI> I might forbear till I am <HI>&s;ure;</HI> But the que&s;tion is, not only whether <HI>I</HI> have a right to this ordi|nance, but whether <HI>God</HI> al&s;o has not a right to my attendance there. If I am a real d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ciple of Chri&s;t, I am <HI>commanded</HI> to attend, therefore to refu&s;e it, would be di&s;obedience and &s;in, whether I am <HI>a&s;&s;ured</HI> of my love to Chri&s;t or no. His com|mand is not, "If ye <HI>know</HI> ye are my di&s;ciples, <HI>do this,</HI> &amp;c.

And yet in the <HI>&s;ame page</HI> he holds, that a per&s;on when he offers his child in bapti&s;m, mu&s;t &s;ay, "that as far as he knows his own heart, he is <HI>&s;incerely willing</HI> to give up him&s;elf and his children to God," which is as high a profe&s;&s;ion as ever any in the <HI>new</HI> &s;cheme (as he terms it) in&s;i&s;ted upon in order to their coming to <HI>any</HI> ordinance. So that if the per&s;on profe&s;&s;ing this, has no <HI>&s;av|ing faith,</HI> no "real grace" (which Mr. C. holds a nece&s;&s;ary qualifi|cation in the &s;ight of God) or if he <HI>has</HI> it and don't know it, he is, according to Mr. Cotton, guilty of <HI>perjury.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, according to Mr. C's rea&s;on|ing, that the <HI>forms</HI> of covenanting made u&s;e of all over the country, and formerly by him&s;elf, &s;hould be all immediately aboli&s;hed, and
<PB N="47" REF="012984_0053_0F903E7C5E4DE770">&s;ome new one found out. For they all with one voice, according to Mr. C. con&s;pire to make men <HI>perjure</HI> them&s;elves; nay all that ever joined to a church, have already been guilty of downright "perjury and lying," unle&s;s they had full <HI>a&s;&s;urance</HI> that they were <HI>truly gra|cious.</HI> For they have &s;olemnly as it were upon oath <HI>avouched the Lord for their God, and given them&s;elves up to him,</HI> &amp;c. when they did not <HI>know</HI> it was <HI>true,</HI> which Mr. C. &s;ays is the "very e&s;&s;ence of a lie."</P>
<P>Yet notwith&s;tanding all this, he &s;ays, p. 4. "They do not come with a <HI>lie</HI> in their mouths if they act con&s;cientiou&s;ly, and if, as far as they know their own hearts, they are <HI>&s;incere</HI> in what they profe&s;s." A direct contradiction to his account of <HI>perjury,</HI> ju&s;t quoted. For according to what he &s;ays now, if they &s;incerely believe, what they profe&s;s, to be true, they <HI>do not lie,</HI> whatever profe&s;&s;ion they make; whether they have <HI>a&s;&s;urance</HI> or no. But it would be endle&s;s to fol|low Mr. C. in all the contradictions and incon&s;i&s;tencies, which he &s;eems nece&s;&s;arily to run into, in vindicating his plan.</P>
<P>Mr. C. &s;trenuou&s;ly and repeatedly in&s;i&s;ts, that <HI>Infant bapti&s;m</HI> can|not be maintained upon the plan he is oppo&s;ing, but mu&s;t be given up. P. 2, 62. But this he a&s;&s;erts on a &s;uppo&s;ition entirely without foun|dation, viz. That we <HI>deny infant member&s;hip:</HI> Which is a very great mi&s;take in him; (to call it no more) I never denied or tho't of deny|ing that they were made vi&s;ible members of the church, by that initiating ordinance. As I have before ob&s;erved, all that I ever held, was that Bapti&s;m in infancy, did not &s;o con&s;titute them <HI>members,</HI> as that nothing el&s;e was nece&s;&s;ary, when they grew up, in order to their being admitted to &s;pecial ordinances; or that they might enjoy the&s;e priviledges, whether they made any profe&s;&s;ion of faith in Chri&s;t and obedience to him or not, or walked in all his commandments or not. This I denied; and do &s;till.</P>
<P>It might with great truth and ju&s;tice be retorted, I apprehend, that the practice he is &s;o fond of, tends to bring <HI>infant bapti&s;m</HI> into di&s;|grace, and that it can never be vindicated on his plan. Infants are baptized, con&s;idered as <HI>parts of their believing parents,</HI> and as <HI>one</HI> with them, as Mr. C. owns, p. 13. The right to the external &s;eal is argued from <HI>Gen.</HI> xvii. where God promi&s;es to be <HI>a God to him and to his &s;eed.</HI> Which the Apo&s;tle quotes, <HI>Acts</HI> ii. 39. <HI>The pro|mi&s;e is unto you and to your children,</HI> i. e to you who are the chil|dren of <HI>Abraham</HI> and have the <HI>faith of Abraham;</HI> and to your <HI>children,</HI> as <HI>parts</HI> of your&s;elves. For the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>Gal.</HI> iii. 29.
<PB N="48" REF="012984_0054_0F903E7D13EEFB48">"If ye be <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s, then are ye <HI>Abraham's &s;eed</HI> and heirs according to the <HI>promi&s;e.</HI>" There are no promi&s;es made in the covenant of grace to <HI>unbelievers,</HI> or to their <HI>children.</HI> Whereas we may find promi&s;es all over the bible concerning the <HI>&s;eed</HI> or <HI>children</HI> of believers.

The bapti&s;m of infants is the &s;eal of <HI>the&s;e promi&s;es</HI> made to the &s;eed of the faithful, or true believers. And on <HI>the&s;e</HI> principles, &s;ome rational as well as &s;criptural account may be given of <HI>infant bapti&s;m.</HI> But there can be none, upon Mr. C.'s &s;cheme of the lawfulne&s;s of per&s;ons coming to this ordinance tho' "really de&s;titute of grace;" and that "their coming &s;o, will be <HI>le&s;s offen&s;ive</HI> to GOD, than the omi&s;&s;ion would be." On <HI>this</HI> &s;cheme, I may be bold to &s;ay, no warrant can be found in &s;cripture, for <HI>infant bapti&s;m;</HI> tis a "mere nullity." For <HI>promi&s;es</HI> are the only warrant for <HI>priviledges.</HI> But there are no promi&s;es in the word of God to the <HI>&s;eed</HI> of impenitent, unregenerate &s;inners.</P>
<P>Mr. C. indeed, in other places &s;ays, per&s;ons mu&s;t be <HI>vi&s;ible believers,</HI> in order to bring their children to bapti&s;m. But it has been &s;hewn, I think clearly, that they are not &s;o, according to CHRIST's de&s;crip|tion of <HI>vi&s;ible di&s;ciples</HI> or believers. And therefore the <HI>children</HI> of &s;uch, can have no right to bapti&s;m, con&s;idered <HI>as</HI> children of believing parents. From what quarter then, do they derive their right?</P>
<P>It might further, be well ob&s;erved here, that pleading for <HI>lower</HI> qualifications for <HI>bapti&s;m</HI> than for the <HI>Lord's Supper,</HI> tends greatly to le&s;&s;en the &s;olemnity and importance of that ordinance; and admini&s;tring bapti&s;m in the latitude pleaded for, tends to reduce it to little more than a mere ceremony. And I verily think, there is nothing in the world has contributed more to prejudice many, <HI>again&s;t</HI> infant bapti&s;m, and to encrea&s;e the number of <HI>Anabapti&s;ts</HI> among us, than this <HI>half way practice,</HI> and the lax method of baptizing the children of any that come and own the covenant; tho', in many places, they are in no other re&s;pect di&s;tingui&s;hed from the world.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I would not be under&s;tood by this, or any thing el&s;e I have &s;aid, to impeach the characters of any in <HI>this place</HI> who have <HI>owned the covenant</HI> &s;ince my acquaintance with them. It mu&s;t be acknowledged they are, to all appearance, per&s;ons of good characters and exemplary conver&s;ation, God alon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> knows the heart.</NOTE> Serious per&s;ons, when they &s;ee tho&s;e (who give no grounds to think they are truly

"How can this be right, <HI>&s;ay they?</HI>" Can it be agrea|ble to the word of God that the infants of <HI>&s;uch</HI> parents &s;hould be bro't to that holy ordinance? Can it be lawful for <HI>&s;uch</HI> per&s;ons to offer them up to God? Surely no. This can never be an in&s;titution of God, or agreable to his will." And thus many &s;erious people, are gradually led to give more and more into the <HI>Antipoedobapti&s;ts</HI> notions&mdash;This induces them to li&s;ten to their teachers, who appear, many of them, to be men of real religion and zealous in the cau&s;e of God&mdash;who, by &s;pecious glo&s;&s;es on various texts of &s;cripture, e&s;tabli&s;h them in their prejudices again&s;t the baptizing of infants; till finally, they leave their former pa&s;tors and principles, and become thorough pro&s;elytes to <HI>anabapti&s;m.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this &s;ection with ob&s;erving, that Mr. C. in de|fending <HI>this practice,</HI> (as many others have done before him) has naturally, and I think, upon his plan, nece&s;&s;arily, warped off from <HI>Calvini&s;m</HI> and run into &s;entiments, re&s;pecting man's <HI>natural depravity,</HI> exactly agreable to <HI>Arminian</HI> writers. Which he would not have done, undoubtedly, had he been aware of it. Whether my ob&s;ervation is ju&s;t, I leave the reader to judge by what follows.</P>
<P>He frequently repre&s;ents <HI>natural</HI> men, as truly de&s;irous of avouch|ing the Lord for their God; as <HI>&s;incerely</HI> entering into covenant with God and giving up them&s;elves and their children to him in covenant. See p. 4, 66, 68, &amp;c. Not only &s;o, but he repre&s;ents the conver&s;ion of &s;inners as owing, &s;ometimes at lea&s;t, to their <HI>not re&s;i&s;ting</HI> the Spirit of God. For &s;peaking of the benefits of infant bapti&s;m, he &s;ays, "As for tho&s;e that grow up, it is a &s;eal at lea&s;t that they &s;hall not only have the offer of CHRIST, but the <HI>&s;trivings of his Spirit,</HI> which, <HI>if not re&s;i&s;ted,</HI> will prove effectual to their conver&s;ion." p. 17. This, at lea&s;t, &s;uppo&s;es, that in <HI>&s;ome</HI> in&s;tances, the Spirit of God is <HI>not re&s;i&s;ted</HI> by &s;uch per&s;ons, and that this non-re&s;i&s;tance is the <HI>rea&s;on</HI> why his <HI>&s;trivings</HI> are effectual to their conver&s;ion. Is not this a plain, implicit denial of the doctrines of <HI>total depravity</HI> and <HI>irre&s;i&s;tible grace,</HI> which have been reckoned &s;uch important doctrines of <HI>Calvini&s;m?</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If this had been con&s;i&s;tent with &s;ound <HI>calvini&s;tic</HI> doctrine, 'tis inconceivable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o me how it came to be placed among, and condemned as one of the <HI>five</HI> grand errors of the <HI>Semi Pelay<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ans,</HI> See <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">heim, Vol. 1. p. 426. or Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">age hi&s;t, de l'Egl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">om. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. p. 69<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> It is doubtle&s;s true, that <HI>if</HI> &s;inners do not <HI>re&s;i&s;t</HI> the &s;trivings of the Spirit, they <HI>will</HI> be effectual to their conver&s;ion. But where was ever the in&s;tance, &s;ince God has been, in CHRIST, reconciling the
<PB N="50" REF="012984_0056_0F903E7E866A1318">world to him&s;elf, that a &s;inner <HI>did not re&s;i&s;t</HI> the Spirit of God; whether he had been baptized or not? And did not Mr. C. u&s;e to preach up &s;uch doctrine formerly? What can he intend here then, by intimating that <HI>baptized unregenerates</HI> may &s;ometimes <HI>not re&s;i&s;t</HI> the Spirit of God, and &s;o, by <HI>that means</HI> become converted? Is not this the plain &s;en&s;e and &s;cope of his argument in this place? If it be not, I am utterly at a lo&s;s what &s;en&s;e can be put upon it.</P>
<P>Therefore, further to &s;upport this &s;entiment he has quoted the words of a writer, not the mo&s;t noted for <HI>Calvini&s;m;</HI> in which, I would al&s;o ob&s;erve, he e&s;pou&s;es the doctrine of <HI>promi&s;es</HI> of &s;aving ble&s;&s;ings to the <HI>unregenerate.</HI> For he quotes with approbation, the follow|ing words from that author: "The Lord will as <HI>a&s;&s;uredly</HI> ingra&s;t us into Chri&s;t, and cloath us with his righteou&s;ne&s;s, as we have the <HI>outward wa&s;hing,</HI> IF <HI>we deprive not our&s;elves thereof by our own carele&s;&s;ne&s;s,</HI>" p. 17. The carele&s;&s;ne&s;s here intended, mu&s;t be the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of the unregenerate, which they may put off, and yet be <HI>unregenerate</HI> &s;till. Otherwi&s;e there is no &s;en&s;e or meaning in the words. If, by putting off this <HI>carele&s;&s;ne&s;s</HI> he means <HI>faith in Chri&s;t,</HI> or believ|ing to &s;alvation, none ever denied that <HI>&s;uch</HI> would be "cloathed with the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t"&mdash;and therefore this would be quoting the pa&s;&s;age to no kind of purpo&s;e for the argument he has in hand.</P>
<P>Mr. C. further &s;uppo&s;es, that men while <HI>unregenerate</HI> do <HI>endea|vour</HI> to believe, repent and obey; in <HI>confidence</HI> of God's help and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. And that the&s;e <HI>endeavours</HI> are <HI>go&s;pel duties,</HI> which un|regenerate men <HI>diligently perform,</HI> p. 17, marg. "One end of this ordinance is to quicken our dulne&s;s, and excite our diligence in <HI>per|forming go&s;pel duties,</HI> viz. our endeavours to <HI>believe, repent,</HI> and <HI>obey,</HI> in <HI>confidence</HI> of God's help and a&s;&s;i&s;tance." According to this, gracele&s;s per&s;ons, (for he is &s;peaking of tho&s;e that are de&s;titute of the "&s;piritual wa&s;hing") do with diligence <HI>perform go&s;pel duties.</HI> And the&s;e evangelical duties are, <HI>"endeavours to believe;"</HI> to which endeavours, there are <HI>promi&s;es</HI> of a&s;&s;i&s;tance; for without this, cer|tainly there could be no ground of <HI>"confidence"</HI> of it.</P>
<P>He has al&s;o plainly a&s;&s;erted p. 19, that in <HI>infants</HI> there is <HI>no re&s;i|&s;tance</HI> or <HI>oppo&s;ition</HI> to God's grace. Speaking of infants, he &s;ays, concerning mo&s;t of them, "they have not the <HI>grace</HI> of the covenant, tho' there be <HI>no re&s;i&s;tance</HI> or <HI>oppo&s;ition</HI> on their parts." This is to &s;ay, they are not depraved and have not original &s;in, if our <HI>a&s;&s;embly of divines</HI> have given a right account of it. For they &s;ay expre&s;ly, that "original corruption is that whereby we are MADE OPPOSITE to <HI>all good,</HI>" (Conf. of faith.)</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="012984_0057_0F903E7F648D6048">
May not Mr. C. with great propriety be advi&s;ed to look round him&s;elf, and &s;ee into what company he is fallen, by attempting to vin|dicate his &s;cheme? Surely it is a bad cau&s;e that can be defended with no better weapons than the&s;e, and thus leads a man unawares, into the mire. It can be no great matter of &s;urprize, if Mr. C. &s;hould <HI>now</HI> meet with the approbation and <HI>applau&s;e</HI> of <HI>&s;ome,</HI> for his performance, whom <HI>once</HI> he did not e&s;teem the greate&s;t friends of <HI>Calvini&s;m,</HI> and of what <HI>he</HI> has called <HI>experimental</HI> religion.</P>
<P>And this leads me to ob&s;erve, that they who will <HI>con&s;i&s;tently</HI> hold the doctrine of man's <HI>total depravity</HI> by nature, and will adhere to the &s;cripture account of the character and &s;tate of unregenerate &s;in|ners, as being <HI>without &s;trength,</HI> their carnal minds <HI>enmity again&s;t God</HI>&mdash;full of <HI>oppo&s;ition</HI> in their hearts to all <HI>holine&s;s</HI>&mdash;as having no real <HI>de&s;ires</HI> after it&mdash;but naturally <HI>oppo&s;ing</HI> the Spirit of God; and as being <HI>voluntary</HI> in all this, and therefore entirely to blame, and wholly <HI>without excu&s;e</HI> in their continued impenitence and unbelief; &s;uch, will naturally drop all notions of unregenerate men's <HI>&s;incerely covenanting</HI> with God; and will be mo&s;t likely to come into the true &s;criptural plan of <HI>infant bapti&s;m.</HI> While tho&s;e, who would be called <HI>half way Calvini&s;ts,</HI> may oppo&s;e it zealou&s;ly, and in their oppo&s;i|tion, (without de&s;ign perhaps) give up &s;ome of the mo&s;t fundamental doctrines of <HI>Calvini&s;m.</HI> So that it will perhaps appear, at bottom, that the di&s;pute is, really, more about <HI>doctrines</HI> than <HI>di&s;cipline,</HI> and that if we were entirely agreed in the <HI>former,</HI> there would not be much difficulty as to the <HI>latter.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION VI.</HI> Shewing wherein Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> has, in &s;ome in&s;tances, <HI>mi&s;apprehended</HI> me, and in others <HI>mi&s;repre&s;ented</HI> Things, both re&s;pecting me and the Brethren on the &s;ame &s;ide of the Que&s;tion.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. I Cannot think it quite a fair way of proceeding, for Mr. C. &s;o frequently to repre&s;ent it as our opinion, that a man <HI>mu&s;t know</HI> he is in a gracious &s;tate&mdash;mu&s;t have <HI>a&s;&s;urance</HI> that he is converted, before he <HI>pre&s;ume</HI> to come to the&s;e ordinances. 'Tis a doctrine we never held, but have over and over di&s;claimed, in public and private. Neither does it follow that <HI>a&s;&s;urance</HI> is nece&s;&s;ary, any more from <HI>our</HI>
<PB N="52" REF="012984_0058_0F903E8002D70530">principles than <HI>his own.</HI> And yet how often does he repre&s;ent us as holding this opinion? P. 6, 7, 9, 10, 20, &amp;c. and indeed throughout a great part of his fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay, and in many other places.</P>
<P N="2">2. In p. 6. he plainly intimates that I "vehemently urge per&s;ons to come into full communion." And p. 26. That I am for "obliging them to come immediately into full communion." As if I would merely force them in, whether willing or no. This is a very hard and unju&s;t repre&s;entation. I appeal to all that have ever come to talk with me on that head, whether this has been my method, or any thing like it. The mo&s;t that I have ever &s;aid to them in the&s;e ca&s;es, is, they if they found a heart to give up them&s;elves to God in Chri&s;t, as they profe&s;s to do in owning the covenant, I apprehended they might as lawfully and &s;afely come to the Lord's Supper, as to Bapti&s;m.</P>
<P N="3">3. I have good grounds to think Mr. C. is mi&s;taken in the repre|&s;entation he has given of the manner in which this practice was fir&s;t introduced into this church by Mr. <HI>Leonard,</HI> p. 26. The fact was this, my venerable Predece&s;&s;or propo&s;ed this plan to the church fir&s;t, in <HI>July</HI> 1726. He gave his rea&s;ons for it, which are upon record. But the church acted nothing upon it at this time. It is certain there was a great number of the church again&s;t the new propo&s;ed plan; I have rea&s;on to think the bigger part. For the affair was in agita|tion, before it was accompli&s;hed, near &s;ix years. In <HI>December</HI> 1731, there was a vote obtained for it; not by a unanimous voice, but (as the records &s;ay) by "a very <HI>con&s;iderable</HI> majority." And tho' there was a <HI>calm &s;pirit,</HI> no bitter contentions at the meeting when it pa&s;&s;ed, yet there were &s;ome, and of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable members too, who were again&s;t it to the la&s;t; and at the very time it was obtained, &s;ome "objected again&s;t it," as Mr. <HI>Leonard</HI> him&s;elf has recorded. And there is now living an aged and worthy member, who was then pre|&s;ent and has told me it was matter of great grief to him and many others of the brethren; that they never could approve of the practice, and &s;everal he knew, bore it as their burden to their dying day.</P>
<P>Mr. C. frequently charges me with making an <HI>innovation</HI> in the church&mdash;and repre&s;ents me as to blame for endeavoring to bring in a <HI>new</HI> &s;cheme, &amp;c. and intimates that the church were all very well contented with the former practice. In this he is certainly greatly mi&s;taken. It has been far from being agreable to the minds of all the church or congregation, for many years pa&s;t. Numbers have told me, long before I ever mentioned the affair at the church meeting, that it always appeared a dark, unaccountable affair to them; that they
<PB N="53" REF="012984_0059_0F903E86658CD2D0">never could &s;ee into the lawfulne&s;s or propriety of this half way practice, of per&s;ons making &s;uch a &s;olemn profe&s;&s;ion of religion, and never coming up to the Lord's table.</P>
<P>But why &s;hould I be charged with making an <HI>innovation</HI> in the church, any more than Mr. <HI>Leonard</HI> before me? Mr. C. has never, that I know of, looked upon it as a crime in him, or that he di&s;turbed the peace of the church, by propo&s;ing this practice; when indeed, it might with much greater propriety be called an <HI>innovation</HI> at that day; for it was a thing entirely unknown to the church, from their foundation to that time. Neither is there the lea&s;t appearance, but that the church were quite contended with the <HI>good old way</HI> they had always been in: And that the alteration entirely originated from their pa&s;tor. (Not that I think he had no right to make the motion, as he was con&s;cientiou&s;ly of that opinion.) Whereas my propo&s;al was, only to return back to the original plan of this church and of all the churches in New England, re&s;pecting Bapti&s;m.</P>
<P N="4">4. Mr. C. mu&s;t have greatly mi&s;apprehended me, in that he has repre&s;ented me in p. 55. as holding that "the bapti&s;m of children, and of adults is quite of a <HI>different nature;</HI>" and that "adults, by bapti&s;m, were entitled to <HI>all</HI> the priviledges of the church, whereas infants were not." I have &s;aid, and do &s;till hold, that Bapti&s;m <HI>alone,</HI> does entitle, neither <HI>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> not <HI>adults,</HI> to all church priviledges, without a profe&s;&s;ion an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ctice conformable to their bapti&s;mal vows and obligations. In &s;hort this long &s;tring of arguments in his <HI>la&s;t</HI> e&s;&s;ay, &s;eems to be founded entirely upon a mi&s;taken &s;uppo&s;ition that we had <HI>denied</HI> infant member&s;hip <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a &s;en&s;e, in which we never thought of denying it.</P>
<P>But he will object, perhaps, of what advantage then is infant-bapti&s;m? Tho&s;e that have <HI>never</HI> been baptized, have a right to all church pri|viledges, upon their making a <HI>profe&s;&s;on</HI> of faith, and a <HI>practice</HI> agreeable. An&s;. This objection &s;uppo&s;e either, 1. That unregene|rate per&s;ons have a right to &s;pecial ordinances, provided they have been baptized; which is directly repugnant to his declared &s;enti|ments, p. 30. Or 2dly. That bapti&s;m actually confers <HI>grace;</HI> and that it is a regenerating ordinance. Otherwi&s;e how can their bapti&s;m in infancy give them a lawful <HI>right,</HI> when he acknowledges none can have this <HI>right</HI> without "real grace?" Therefore in&s;i&s;ting on this objection, is only running him&s;elf into a direct incon&s;i&s;tency. But I think there is a further, and ea&s;y an&s;wer to be given to the objection. The advantages of infant bapti&s;m are <HI>much every way.</HI> They are
<PB N="54" REF="012984_0060_0F903E87E771FA08">hereby initiated into the <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> family or church of God; &s;olemnly devoted to God by the believing parent, who lays him&s;elf under the mo&s;t &s;acred engagements to bring them up <HI>in the nurture and admo|nition of the Lord.</HI> They are hereby declared children of the cove|nant&mdash;<HI>vi&s;ible</HI> heirs of eternal life, by virtue of the believing parent's covenanting with God, in which covenant, the parent takes hold of that divine promi&s;e, "I will be a God to <HI>thee</HI> and to <HI>thy &s;eed.</HI>" So that they are <HI>vi&s;ibly</HI> introduced among the <HI>&s;aved,</HI> the <HI>holy people</HI> of God, and (as to <HI>men</HI>) have a <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> right to all covenant priviledges and ought to be admitted to them, when capable of them, unle&s;s by <HI>their own</HI> conduct they di&s;cover the contrary, and exclude them&s;elves by a manife&s;t <HI>refu&s;ing</HI> to own the God of their fathers for <HI>their</HI> God and to &s;ubject them&s;elves to Chri&s;t in all things according to the tenor of their bapti&s;mal covenant. They are, moreover, by their bapti&s;m, taken under the &s;pecial <HI>watch</HI> and care of the <HI>church</HI>&mdash;entitled in a more peculiar manner to their <HI>prayers,</HI> as well as to the painful <HI>in|&s;truction, admonition, care</HI> and <HI>prayers</HI> of the <HI>parent;</HI> who is under <HI>covenant bonds</HI> to the&s;e things. Are all the&s;e a "mere nullity?" Is &s;uch a child in no better condition, and under no more advantages than tho&s;e whom Mr. C. calls "<HI>Pagans, Infidels</HI> and <HI>Heathens?</HI>" And if the <HI>di&s;cipline</HI> of our churches was not dwindled almo&s;t to nothing, if parents and charches were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">entious to act up to their covenant engagements re&s;pecting baptiz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hildren, would they not then, be under any better advantages for their &s;ouls, than the <HI>unbap|tized?</HI> And if when they grow up, and thro' the negligence and wicked carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of their parents and other means, they appear not to have the fear and love of God in them, but live in the <HI>habitual neglect</HI> or violation of tho&s;e commands which Chri&s;t has enjoined on all his <HI>di&s;ciples</HI> as di&s;tingui&s;hed from the world; I &s;ay, if this be the ca&s;e with baptized per&s;ons when grown up, mu&s;t we be charged with "<HI>unchurching</HI> and <HI>excommunicating</HI> them" if we don't allow them the &s;pecial priviledges of <HI>di&s;ciples?</HI> And mu&s;t we be repre&s;ented as treating them like "dogs," and <HI>abu&s;ing</HI> them, when they are denied the&s;e priviledges, merely on their <HI>own</HI> account, viz. becau&s;e they will not act up to the character and obligations laid upon them by their bapti&s;m? If they will only do this, and there be the vi&s;ible appearance of it to the church, we are ready, with all our hearts, to grant them this, and <HI>all</HI> priviledges. If they will not do this, the &s;in lies, not at <HI>our,</HI> but at <HI>their own</HI> door. It would be unrea&s;onable, in the highe&s;t degree, to blame the church, or tho&s;e who are for not granting pri|viledges
<PB N="55" REF="012984_0061_0F903E8849A715A8">to per&s;ons who do not come up to the character CHRIST <HI>him&s;elf</HI> has given, of tho&s;e unto whom &s;uch priviledges belong.</P>
<P N="5">5. What a new and &s;urprizing expo&s;ition has Mr. C. given of that text in <HI>Jer.</HI> iii. 14. <HI>Turn O back&s;liding children for I am married unto you.</HI> P. 59, he &s;ays, "'Tis abundantly evident that this is &s;poken of <HI>unregenerates.</HI>" 'Tis the fir&s;t time, I confe&s;s, that I ever heard &s;uch a con&s;truction put upon the&s;e words.</P>
<P>Whoever will be at the pains to read the context, will &s;ee, that the&s;e words were &s;poken to a people <HI>in covenant</HI> with God; <HI>vi&s;ible believers,</HI> and in <HI>that character only;</HI> whatever their inward &s;tate was. God &s;peaks, as to <HI>true &s;aints,</HI> tho&s;e whom he had cho&s;en and called, and had bro't <HI>near</HI> to him&s;elf. Therefore he is <HI>not a&s;hamed to be called their father.</HI> Hence he &s;peaks to them in that endear|ing manner, <HI>ver&s;e</HI> 4th. <HI>Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me,</HI> MY FATHER, <HI>thou art the guide of my youth,</HI> &amp;c. Yet, notwith|&s;tanding this dear relation, and their obligations to God, they had &s;hamefully back&s;liden from him. Wherefore, with the bowels of an affectionate hu&s;band, with inexpre&s;&s;ible tenderne&s;s, he calls to them in the&s;e words; enough to melt their hearts into tears of &s;ilial &s;orrow and &s;hame; <HI>Turn ye back&s;liding children, for I married unto you.</HI> God is &s;peaking to them here, evidently after the manner of men. Loth to give them up, notwith&s;tanding they had ungratefully depart|ed and gone out of the way, he is inviting them to return. They were in the ca&s;e of a <HI>wi&s;e,</HI> who has for&s;aken her <HI>hu&s;band,</HI> and gone after <HI>other lovers.</HI> Her hu&s;band, in&s;tead of divorcing her, as he ju&s;tly might, is u&s;ing means to reclaim her; and kindly promi&s;es, upon her return, freely to forgive her, and to remember her iniquities no more. For he remembered <HI>the kindne&s;s of her youth and the love of her</HI> ESPOUSALS, and is willing to be <HI>pacified towards her.</HI></P>
<P>Can it be wondered at then, that I &s;hould endeavour (as Mr. C. tells his readers I did, &s;oon after) to re&s;cue the&s;e words from, what I thought, &s;o glaring and dangerous a mi&s;application; e&s;pecially when it was delivered with &s;o much confidence, and in &s;o public a manner, to the people of my charge?</P>
<P N="6">6. I come now to take notice of a very cruel in&s;tance of his <HI>mi&s;|repre&s;entation,</HI> in (p. 62) Where, (tho' he does not call me by name) yet he plainly intimates that I have &s;poken, with the mo&s;t &s;hocking contempt, of the ordinance of <HI>bapti&s;m,</HI> in tho&s;e words, "What &s;ig|nifies it to have an infant &s;prinkled with a little water?" Any per&s;on by reading this &s;entence, and ob&s;erving the manner in which 'tis bro't
<PB N="56" REF="012984_0062_0F903E89079F9960">in, would naturally think me guilty of that, which was not much &s;hort of a <HI>bla&s;phemous</HI> a&s;&s;ertion. And very ju&s;tly too, had I &s;poken with that ridiculous contempt of a &s;acred ordinance of Chri&s;t, as he there repre&s;ents. For he has never given his readers any account of what was &s;aid before or after the expre&s;&s;ions he has put down. Mr. C. cannot but know that he has not herein acted, <HI>as he would that others &s;hould do to him;</HI> but has greatly abu&s;ed me. The utmo&s;t that <HI>charity</HI> it&s;elf can do, in excu&s;e for him, is, to &s;uppo&s;e or hope that, in the great perturbation of his &s;pirits, he did not attend to what I was &s;peaking of at the time I &s;uppo&s;e he refers to. Let it be ob&s;erved then, Mr. C. had then been in&s;i&s;ting on the great priviledge of infants bapti&s;m; and had, as I tho't, car|ried the matter too far; even &s;o far, that people would be in danger of thinking that they were actually <HI>regenerated</HI> by bapti&s;m; and therefore all that were not baptized mu&s;t con&s;equently be lo&s;t. Moreover, in&s;i&s;ted that <HI>all</HI> baptized per&s;ons had a right to this privi|ledge, whether regenerate or not, if they were free from <HI>here&s;y</HI> or <HI>&s;candal,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. In an&s;wer to which, I &s;aid, to this effect,, "That the baptizing the infants of believing parents, tho' it made them <HI>vi&s;i|ble</HI> members, yet 'tis certain that many of the&s;e, when grown up, appear to be <HI>not real chri&s;tians.</HI> And it would be very dangerous to view them as &s;uch. "For <HI>circumci&s;ion</HI> availeth nothing, nor <HI>uncircumci&s;ion,</HI> but a <HI>new creature.</HI>" And as to baptizing the children of tho&s;e, who make no profe&s;&s;ion of <HI>real</HI> religion, and appear to have no other qualification than only their having been <HI>baptized them&s;elves</HI> and free from open wickedne&s;s, I apprehended they had <HI>no &s;cripture warrant</HI> for it. And if &s;o, what <HI>right</HI> have we to baptize &s;uch? What good will bapti&s;m do their children, if admini&s;tered without a divine warrant? Of what advantage can it be to the &s;ouls of their children, barely to have the <HI>external wa&s;hing, or water &s;prinkled upon them?</HI> Will this <HI>&s;ave them?</HI> will it entitle them to any of the &s;pecial priviledges of God's covenant? If not, why &s;hould this matter be pu&s;hed &s;o vehemently, as if the <HI>&s;alvation of their &s;ouls</HI> depended upon their having this <HI>outward &s;ign</HI> admini&s;tered to them&mdash;and therefore they <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be bro't, and the church <HI>mu&s;t</HI> receive them, whether they have a lawful right according to Chri&s;t's rules or not." This was the &s;ub&s;tance and &s;cope of what I &s;aid in an&s;wer to Mr. C. at the meeting. I meant nothing more. How injurious therefore mu&s;t it be, for Mr. C. to in&s;inuate, that I had ca&s;t &s;uch &s;acrilegious <HI>contempt</HI> upon that holy ordinance of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as he evidently
<PB N="57" REF="012984_0063_0F903E89C6735630">does, by the <HI>manner</HI> in which he mentions the above pa&s;&s;age. Such treatment is exceeding unkind; and none can think it ought to pa&s;s without proper notice and re&s;entment.</P>
<P N="7">7. Mr. C.'s fondne&s;s for adducing human te&s;timonies in &s;upport of his &s;cheme, has led him to a&s;&s;ert with confidence, a propo&s;ition, which I am confident he will be put to &s;ome difficulty to prove&mdash;unle&s;s <HI>his</HI> a&s;&s;erting it &s;hould be deemed &s;ufficient proof. The propo&s;ition is this, p. 63, "This has been the <HI>univer&s;ally</HI> received opinion of mini&s;ters and churches, from Chri&s;t's time to this day; except Mr. <HI>Davenport,</HI> Mr. <HI>Street</HI> and 2 or 3 others in the time of the <HI>Synod;</HI> and a few <HI>Connecticut</HI> mini&s;ters, &amp;c. in our days." By "opinion" here, he can't intend, merely their opinion concerning the <HI>member&s;hip of in|fants;</HI> for tho&s;e mini&s;ters whom he has &s;truck off from his li&s;t, never did deny, (that I have ever heard) <HI>infants being members;</HI> initiated by bapti&s;m. So that it mu&s;t be concluded he means they were all of <HI>his opinion</HI> in this controver&s;y. Therefore the propo&s;ition needs no comment. The judicious reader, who has had the lea&s;t acquaintance with eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory, will form his own judgment, concerning the probability of the truth of the a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>Mr. C. in the &s;ame page, in his manner of &s;umming up the matter, would induce his readers to imagine, the point I have di&s;puted for mu&s;t be given up, upon <HI>my own conce&s;&s;ion</HI>&mdash;(&s;ee bottom of p. 63)&mdash;his con&s;equence is, Therefore <HI>"it undeniably follows that the chil|dren of &s;uch as have been baptized, are to be baptized; and none can lawfully deny them this priviledge,</HI> UNLESS <HI>they have forfeited it by their wickedne&s;s."</HI> I allow it all&mdash;And what advantage has he got by the conce&s;&s;ion? I humbly conceive, that in&s;tead of overthrow|ing the &s;cheme I have endeavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h, he has implicitly, but effectually given up <HI>his own,</HI> unle&s;s he will deny it to be "wicked|ne&s;s" to live in the habitual and continued <HI>neglect</HI> of, and <HI>di&s;obedience</HI> to the expre&s;s <HI>command of</HI> JESUS CHRIST; which enjoins all his di&s;|ciples to openly acknowledge and <HI>confe&s;s him</HI> before the world, and <HI>walk in</HI> ALL <HI>his ordinances,</HI> upon pain of a ju&s;t forfeiture of the <HI>cha|racter</HI> and <HI>priviledges</HI> of his di&s;ciples, or vi&s;ible chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>What Mr. C. has &s;aid, in his <HI>"challenge,"</HI> p. 64, concerning <HI>Ar|miniani&s;m</HI>&mdash;<HI>Athei&s;m,</HI> &amp;c. mu&s;t be judged of by the impartial reader. After what I have already remarked concerning the tendency of this practice, I am free to &s;ubmit it to the <HI>Calvini&s;tick</HI> world to judge, whe|ther it can be &s;upported, without running a per&s;on directly into <HI>Arminian</HI> &s;entiments, re&s;pecting the great and peculiar doctrines be|fore
<PB N="58" REF="012984_0064_0F903E8AAC837648">mentioned. But why he brings in the <HI>Apo&s;tle James</HI> in this argument, I can't devi&s;e; nor the pertinency of it to what he would prove. I confe&s;s I don't &s;ee why he might not have bro't any ver&s;e in <HI>Nehemiah</HI> or <HI>Exodus,</HI> and it had been about as much to his pur|po&s;e as this. Be&s;ure I think he has exhibited a remarkable talent at argumentation in this page. Becau&s;e I &s;uppo&s;ed, that <HI>this plan,</HI> in its nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences, tended to &s;upport &s;ome of the <HI>Arminian</HI> tenets, <HI>therefore,</HI> I am accu&s;ed of charging Mr. <HI>Leonard,</HI> Mr. <HI>Cotton,</HI> the Apo&s;|tle <HI>James</HI> and my&s;elf, with being direct <HI>Arminians.</HI> Pray may'nt a per&s;on hold to &s;ome things, which in their <HI>con&s;equences,</HI> involve a denial of or giving up &s;ome <HI>Calvini&s;tic</HI> doctrines, without being ju&s;tly called an <HI>Arminian?</HI> And when, if he &s;aw the&s;e to be the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences of his principle, he would immediately renounce it?&mdash;In no other &s;en&s;e then this, did I ever charge Mr. C. with being an <HI>Arminian</HI>&mdash;And I have repeatedly told him, that I did not think him an <HI>Arminian,</HI> but the contrary; as I believed he was not aware of, what appeared to me, the unavoidable con&s;equence of his &s;enti|ments upon <HI>this practice.</HI> And yet Mr. C.'s repre&s;entation of this matter is &s;uch, as mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily lead his readers to think, I had &s;et him forth to my people (as he expre&s;&s;es it el&s;ewhere) as "a <HI>&s;oul-de&s;troying Arminian</HI> and deceiver, unfit ever to preach any more;" and that I did this, with no other de&s;ign, neither, than to "throw out a <HI>bugbear</HI> and <HI>&s;carecrow,</HI> to prevent people li&s;tening to his arguments." Is there no <HI>"con&s;eriou&s;ne&s;s"</HI> or <HI>"uncharitablene&s;s"</HI> in this? I would a&s;k Mr. C. whether he thinks I might not, with &s;ome propriety here, exclaim in <HI>his own language,</HI> and &s;ay&mdash;He repre&s;ents me "as merely acting a part&mdash;that all was grimace and farce&mdash;that my di&s;cour&s;e was calculated to impo&s;e on the auditory&mdash;to make them believe what I <HI>knew</HI> was not true&mdash;Lawyerlike, u&s;ing craft in&s;tead of argument"&mdash;by trying to make them believe he was an <HI>Arminian,</HI> when I <HI>knew</HI> he was not, but only meant it for a <HI>"&s;carecrow."</HI> To the &s;ame purpo&s;e, Mr. C. often &s;peaks of my "management"&mdash;as if twas all a piece of art and tricking. And of my in&s;i&s;ting upon <HI>grace</HI> in this di&s;pute only out of "pretence," p. 29, 65, &amp;c. Why might I not, upon this, with equal rea&s;on, cry out, as he has done,&mdash;that he has charged me with <HI>di&s;&s;embling with my brethren,</HI> and made me a "de|&s;igning, fini&s;hed <HI>hypocrite.</HI>" And then add&mdash;"What a&s;&s;uming the prerogative of God&mdash;the <HI>ranke&s;t &s;eperate</HI> never exceeded you in cen|&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s"&mdash;then appeal to the world whether my treatment of him does not re&s;emble the "<HI>&s;cratch</HI> of a pin"&mdash;and his&mdash;"the <HI>&s;tab</HI>

There is one ob&s;ervation, which many have made, during our debates here&mdash;and which could hardly e&s;cape the notice of tho&s;e who have been acquainted with Mr. C.'s manner of conduct thro' this affair&mdash;that is, <HI>'Tis the nature of &s;ome people to be of</HI> VERY QUICK SENSATION, <HI>when injuries are done to</HI> THEM|SELVES&mdash;<HI>while at the &s;ame time, they are perfectly</HI> CALLOUS <HI>and in&s;en&s;ible to the injuries</HI> THEY do to OTHERS.</P>
<P N="8">8. There is one in&s;tance more, wherein Mr. C. has exceedingly mi&s;repre&s;ented our &s;entiments; which is all I &s;hall particularly remark upon at this time: 'tis in p. 65. where he expre&s;sly a&s;&s;erts that <HI>we</HI> in&s;i&s;t "upon the <HI>highe&s;t &s;ort</HI> of evidence of grace, as nece&s;&s;ary" in order to a per&s;on's enjoying ordinances, &amp;c. What colour of foun|dation he had for this a&s;&s;ertion, I cannot conceive; when it is directly again&s;t my repeatedly declared &s;entiments; and I have rea&s;on to think, again&s;t the &s;entiments of every member of the church on this &s;ide the que&s;tion. I have publickly, in all our <HI>church meetings</HI> declared the contrary, viz. That the very <HI>lea&s;t degree</HI> of grace intitled a per&s;on to <HI>all</HI> the priviledges of the covenant, in the &s;ight of God&mdash;and as to the <HI>church,</HI> that where a candidate exhibited the <HI>lowe&s;t rational evidence</HI> of it, or &s;uch an outward manife&s;tation as rendered it pro|bable, on &s;cripture grounds, that they were <HI>&s;incere friends</HI> to religion, they ought to be admitted. I never was for &s;training things, in the manner Mr. C. repre&s;ents. I never tho't a church &s;hould in&s;i&s;t on the "<HI>highe&s;t &s;ort</HI> of evidence" in this ca&s;e. Indeed, I never tho't it was &s;criptural to admit them upon "<HI>negative</HI> evidence," or no evi|dence at all, 'tis true. I can't &s;uppo&s;e it <HI>any</HI> evidence at all of a per&s;on's being gracious, merely that he is <HI>not</HI> a drunkard&mdash;<HI>nor</HI> a thief&mdash;<HI>nor</HI> a murderer&mdash;<HI>nor</HI> an adulterer, &amp;c. The&s;e are, indeed, an <HI>evi|dence</HI> that a man is <HI>not</HI> an open <HI>&s;candalous &s;inner</HI>&mdash;but are no proper evidence that he is a <HI>&s;aint;</HI> or upon which, the &s;criptures will war|rant &s;uch a pre&s;umption of it, as will make it lawful for us to treat them as &s;uch.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION VII.</HI> On the Subject of the <HI>Letters,</HI> &amp;c. and Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI>'s Remarks upon them.</HEAD>
<P>I Think there is ju&s;t cau&s;e for &s;ome apology to be made to the pub|lick, e&s;pecially to cho&s;e who are unacquainted with the peculiar circum&s;tances of affairs in this place, for troubling them with matters which are merely <HI>per&s;onal,</HI> between Mr. C. and my&s;elf. A &s;tranger may well &s;ay, "what have we to do with the&s;e <HI>letters?</HI>" The <HI>que&s;|tion</HI> in debate is of public importance, 'tis true.&mdash;But what concern have the <HI>publick,</HI> with <HI>private letters;</HI> which relate to &s;ome diffe|rence between two per&s;ons at Plymouth? How came the&s;e <HI>letters</HI> to be pala<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed upon the world, along with the <HI>arguments?</HI>" This has been the enquiry and &s;urprize of many. And I can make no other an&s;wer to the que&s;tion for the reader's &s;atisfaction, than that they were publi&s;hed entirely without my knowledge or con&s;ent. He never &s;o much as a&s;ked whether I was <HI>willing</HI> my letters &s;hould be printed with the e&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ys: or even hinted to me that he had it in view&mdash;nei|ther did I ever <HI>&s;u&s;pect</HI> they would be publi&s;hed to the world, any more than my ye&s;terday's conver&s;ation, till after they were gone to the pre&s;s. But, contrary to all the rules of politene&s;s, humanity or chri&s;tianity, he has made them as publick as he could, without con|de&s;cending to a&s;k my leave. The world will judge whether &s;uch conduct is ju&s;tifiable, or whether it is not <HI>below</HI> the character of a man of benevolence and uprightne&s;s. This alone is that which has con&s;trained me to trouble the reader with this &s;ection on the <HI>letters.</HI> Mr. C. has, I am informed, endeavoured to excu&s;e this part of his conduct to &s;ome, by &s;aying, 1&s;t. That I had read or communi|cated <HI>his letter</HI> to many per&s;ons before&mdash;and that people had wrong notions about it; therefore 'twas nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould publi&s;h <HI>all,</HI> to vindicate his character. As to this&mdash;I can &s;ay truly, that altho' the&s;e <HI>letters</HI> were &s;oon handed about, and the &s;ubject of them in almo&s;t every one's mouth; yet it was not thro' <HI>my</HI> means, but <HI>his own.</HI> I never &s;hewed them to four per&s;ons in the world, till I had heard he had given off <HI>copies</HI> of them to per&s;ons, who, I am told, made it their bu&s;ine&s;s to propagate them thro' the town and to various parts of the county. And I have no doubt of the truth of it, from &s;ome curious remarks and &s;peeches which, 'tis &s;aid, were made by &s;ome of his&mdash;acquaintance at a di&s;tance, in con&s;equence hereof. So that, if the&s;e letters were made, in a mea&s;ure, <HI>publick,</HI> before they were printed, it
<PB N="61" REF="012984_0067_0F903E8CC6340B10">was owing to him&s;elf and not to me. But 2dly. Another method Mr. C. has taken, I have been informed, is, by endeavouring to prove <HI>that they were not private letters.</HI> Becau&s;e I had given <HI>this</HI> as a rea&s;on of my writing to him at fir&s;t, viz. "That I had not time to make a reply to his 3d e&s;&s;ay, in publick, at the church meeting." Whence he argues, that <HI>my letter</HI> is to be looked upon, as tho' it had been &s;poken or read at the meeting before the whole a&s;&s;embly&mdash;not as a private letter, but as a publick an&s;wer to his e&s;&s;ay, which he had been reading in public. Well, &s;uppo&s;ing it had been &s;o, does that give him a right to <HI>print it</HI> without my knowledge or con&s;ent? If a mini&s;ter &s;hould preach a <HI>Sermon,</HI> (which is a thing of a more publick nature &s;till) and a per&s;on &s;hould be able to take it all down in writing, &s;o that he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the whole, as it was delivered; has he, even in this ca&s;e any right to go and publi&s;h it, without the preacher's con|&s;ent? When we preach, or when we write letters, we &s;hould be glad to know, and perhaps be con&s;ulted, if they are like to be &s;ent <HI>to the pre&s;s,</HI> a&s;&s;oon as they are out of our hands. So that I can conceive of no plea in the world that can ju&s;tify Mr. C.'s conduct, in the freedom he has taken to <HI>print my letters,</HI> unknown to me. I am willing to leave it to the whole impartial world, whether it be chri&s;tian, or manly treatment: or doing as they would be done by.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>contents</HI> of my fir&s;t leter to Mr. C. it contained my real &s;entiments upon his manner of conduct and the things he had advanced. And I have never yet met with any ju&s;t cau&s;e to <HI>alter</HI> my &s;entiments upon them. After &s;tating a few facts, I &s;hall leave it to the reader's judgment, whether I was wrong, in writing what I did.</P>
<P>The grounds and rea&s;ons of my writing to him were the&s;e three, <HI>viz.</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. His having delivered &s;everal things which I really tho't of very <HI>dangerous tendency,</HI> before a large number of the people of my mini&s;terial charge.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. His having gro&s;sly <HI>mi&s;repre&s;ented</HI> us.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Tak|ing <HI>undue</HI> and <HI>unfair methods</HI> to &s;upport his &s;cheme, and prejudice the brethren and others again&s;t our &s;entiments.</ITEM>
</LIST>
&mdash;The&s;e were the real grounds of my letter. I thought it was my duty, in the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances, to do as I did. If I was mi&s;taken, it was an error of <HI>judg|ment,</HI> not of <HI>will.</HI> And truly if I had had a thought beforehand that it would have had &s;uch an effect on him, and cau&s;ed him to put &s;uch a con&s;truction upon it, as he had done, &s;o different from what I ever in|tended or tho't of&mdash;and to rave at me with &s;uch vehemence of &s;pirit, as he has done in that <HI>remarkable po&s;t&s;cript</HI> to his fir&s;t letter&mdash;I &s;hould not have wrote at all to him, but have taken &s;ome other method. For
<PB N="62" REF="012984_0068_0F903E8D8C6ADD10">notwith&s;tanding his intimations to the contrary, I had no de&s;ign in my heart, or de&s;ire to "pick a quarrel with him."&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> ground or rea&s;on of my writing to him, was, his hav|ing delivered &s;everal things, which I looked upon of very <HI>dangerous tendency;</HI> &s;uch as the&s;e. His teaching that it was lawful or &s;afe for <HI>unregenerate</HI> men to <HI>covenant</HI> with God. That all who have ever been baptized, are <HI>vi&s;ible chri&s;tians</HI>&mdash;that is, are to be looked upon as <HI>believers,</HI> if they are but free from open <HI>profane&s;s</HI> and <HI>&s;candal.</HI> P. 27, &amp;c. &amp;c. Such doctrine, is directly contrary to what I have always taught my people. I look upon it as <HI>&s;ewing pillows under armholes</HI>&mdash;that it has a natural tendency to <HI>quiet</HI> &s;inners in their un|regeneracy&mdash;and flatter them with vain hopes that their &s;tate is &s;afe, when it is really infinitely dangerous. Whether it has not this ten|dency, let tho&s;e judge, who experimentally know the deceitfulne&s;s of the human heart, and how extremely prone &s;inners are to re&s;t in any thing &s;hort of CHRIST, and to flatter them&s;elves in their delu&s;ions.</P>
<P>Moreover, his applying the <HI>promi&s;es</HI> of God to tho&s;e that never made any <HI>pretence</HI> to, or <HI>profe&s;&s;ion</HI> of &s;aving religion or faith in Chri&s;t: As he has evidently done in that <HI>text,</HI> p. 29, <HI>"God &s;hall ap|pear to your joy."</HI> Not, of tho&s;e who have given their <HI>names</HI> and <HI>hearts</HI> to Chri&s;t. He was not &s;peaking to &s;uch; but to the <HI>baptized</HI> only, who had never made any publick profe&s;&s;ion of religion, or &s;o much as <HI>renewed their bapti&s;mal covenant.</HI>&mdash;Now had I not rea&s;on to &s;ay, (when I heard &s;uch things delivered, &s;o publickly, which were &s;o <HI>contrary</HI> to what I had ever in&s;tructed this people into) that they were of <HI>dangerous tendency,</HI> and in my view, de&s;tructive of &s;ome of the great truths of the go&s;pel and of <HI>Calvini&s;m,</HI> and tended to &s;up|port the contrary doctrines?</P>
<P N="2">2. The next thing mentioned, as the ground of my writing to Mr. C. and which I charged him with, was, that he had <HI>mi&s;repre|&s;ented</HI> us. Of this al&s;o, let the readers judge, not only from what has been already ob&s;erved, in the 6th Section&mdash;but from what fol|lows,&mdash;he repre&s;ents p. 26, as if I was for "<HI>obliging</HI> per&s;ons to come <HI>immediately</HI> into full communion" contrary to my &s;entiments and univer&s;al practice, ever &s;ince I have been ordained as before ob&s;erved. In p. 30, he &s;ays, "Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI> owns 'tis a matter of <HI>indifferency</HI>" whether per&s;ons make <HI>relations</HI> or not; and "that a church may be rightly con&s;tituted without." And in another place he &s;ays, I have "<HI>&s;poken &s;lightingly</HI> of them." This is a gro&s;s and injurious mi&s;repre|&s;entation; without all foundation. All that I have ever &s;aid, was, that
<PB N="63" REF="012984_0069_0F903E8E7A605600">I tho't <HI>relations</HI> ought not to be made <HI>e&s;&s;ential terms of communion,</HI> for if &s;o, we condemn our&s;elves and act contradictorily; as we admit tho&s;e from <HI>other churches,</HI> to our communion, who have never made any <HI>relations.</HI> As to a church's being "rightly con&s;tituted" with|out them, I tru&s;t Mr. C. would not care to expo&s;e him&s;elf to the charge of ignorance of the nature of a church, &s;o much, as to a&s;&s;ert, that <HI>relations</HI> are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the very <HI>"con&s;titution"</HI> of a church; &s;o that they are not to be looked upon as <HI>"right"</HI> or re|gular churches, who don't in&s;i&s;t on them.</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance of this kind, is in p. 32, where he repre&s;ented, as if we held that per&s;ons mu&s;t not bring their children, unle&s;s they have a certain knowledge or <HI>a&s;&s;urance</HI> of their gracious &s;tate. That "our plan &s;uppo&s;es it <HI>nece&s;&s;ary.</HI>" This is not a little unkind in Mr. C. when we had publickly and con&s;tantly declared directly the contrary all along. What could be the de&s;ign of &s;uch a repre&s;entation, if it was not to prejudice the brethren again&s;t our &s;entiments? And had I not ju&s;t ground, therefore, to &s;ay, that "he mu&s;t <HI>certainly know,</HI> we held no &s;uch thing?" For he mu&s;t have heard me frequently declare again&s;t it, as I had done at all our meetings. If the expre&s;&s;ion is tho't, by any, to carry the matter too far, I am willing to &s;ay, in&s;tead of it, that Mr. C. had <HI>good rea&s;on and &s;ufficient opportunity to know</HI> the contrary. For I can't ab&s;olutely be <HI>certain,</HI> but that he might have turned his face and attention another way, every time I had declared my &s;entiment as above.</P>
<P>Mr. C. repre&s;ents as tho' I was for <HI>driving the matter on with violence.</HI> I have nothing more to &s;ay upon this, than only, that they who were pre&s;ent at our meetings, are the be&s;t judges, who appeared with mo&s;t <HI>violence</HI> and temper.</P>
<P N="3">3. The la&s;t thing mentioned, as the rea&s;on of my writing the <HI>letter</HI> afore&s;aid, was the <HI>unfair methods</HI> he took, working upon people's <HI>pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> in&s;tead of rea&s;on, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h the point in que&s;tion. Of which I &s;hall give a few in&s;tances, and &s;ubmit it.</P>
<P>In p. 29, he repre&s;ents to the brethren, as if we were going to <HI>ex|communicate</HI> their children&mdash;to <HI>unchurch</HI> them, and make <HI>Pagans</HI> and <HI>Heathen</HI> of 'em. Surely this mu&s;t appear a terrible thing to a <HI>parent</HI> that has any love to his <HI>child.</HI> The thought is enough to <HI>frighten</HI> him from being of <HI>our opinion;</HI> if we are &s;uch cruel, unna|tural &s;ort of people. But what does he ground this upon? Why truly <HI>this.</HI> Becau&s;e we hold, that if per&s;ons do not <HI>own Chri&s;t before men,</HI> and walk in <HI>all</HI> his commandments and ordinances, they ought not to
<PB N="64" REF="012984_0070_0F903E8F0C88C550">be admitted to the <HI>priviledges</HI> of Chri&s;t's <HI>vi&s;ible di&s;ciples.</HI> This in all the <HI>unchurching</HI> them, that we are guilty of. And for <HI>this,</HI> we are charged with <HI>excommunicating</HI>&mdash;making them <HI>Pagans</HI> and creating them as "dogs and not lambs."</P>
<P>But this is not all&mdash;As if he was determined to prevent the bre|thren from daring to <HI>"hold up their hands"</HI> to vote to repeal the practice, he &s;ignifies to them, that they would hereby <HI>deliver their children over to Satan.</HI> For the&s;e are his very words, p. 29.&mdash; "Your children are no doubt dear to you, and&mdash;will you, with your own hands lifted up to heaven, <HI>deliver them to Satan?</HI>" Dreadful thought! What parent, in his wits, would do this? And yet this is what you will do, brethren, if you vote with Mr. R. and his brethren. Is not this the plain import of the &s;entence? And can this be called a <HI>fair,</HI> upright way of managing a cau&s;e? Is &s;uch a method, <HI>generous,</HI> in a di&s;putant? If this is not "appealing to men's <HI>pa&s;&s;ions</HI>" in&s;tead of their rea&s;on and judgment, I acknowledge I know not what is.</P>
<P>But we have &s;till more of the &s;ame kind, in the &s;ame page. "If they mu&s;t be <HI>di&s;covenanted,</HI> I can't help turning my&s;elf to them"&mdash; (and then he turned round and looked up to the galleries, full of peo|ple; and with great <HI>Pathos</HI> addre&s;&s;ed tho&s;e that were <HI>baptized</HI> in their infancy, in the&s;e words) <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> lxvi. 5. Your brethren that ca&s;t you out [pointing to me] for my name &s;ake, &s;aid, let the Lord be glorified&mdash;(i. e. as he explains it in the next line but one, <HI>they</HI> PRE|TEND <HI>they are aiming at the glory of God</HI>&mdash;this is only a <HI>"pretence."</HI>)&mdash;<HI>But he &s;hall appear to</HI> YOUR <HI>joy, but</HI> THEY <HI>&s;hall be a&s;hamed.</HI> i. e. Your mini&s;ter and tho&s;e of the church that think as he does; for he directed him&s;elf to us, in the&s;e la&s;t words. Now whoever will be at the pains to turn to this chapter, will immediately &s;ee, that in the&s;e words is contained, a terrible <HI>threatning</HI> or <HI>cur&s;e,</HI> on the one hand; and a precious <HI>promi&s;e,</HI> on the other. On the one hand, God threa|tens <HI>confu&s;ion</HI> and <HI>&s;hame</HI> to the <HI>enemies</HI> of his people&mdash;on the other, he <HI>promi&s;es</HI> JOY and confort and &s;alvation to his <HI>children.</HI> And this was the <HI>text</HI> Mr. C. made u&s;e of, in the <HI>manner</HI> above de&s;cribed: <HI>Applying</HI> and directing the <HI>promi&s;e</HI> of it, to the <HI>unregenerate,</HI> i. e. to tho&s;e who never made any pretence or <HI>profe&s;&s;ion</HI> of grace&mdash;and the <HI>cur&s;e</HI> or threatning of it, to <HI>me,</HI> and <HI>tho&s;e of the church</HI> that were with me in &s;entiment. Let the reader then judge, whether I had not good rea&s;on to &s;ay, that he <HI>wre&s;ted</HI> or <HI>mi&s;applied</HI> &s;cripture, to a <HI>bad purpo&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>But lea&s;t the brethren &s;hould not be &s;ufficiently terrified from vot|ing out the <HI>practice;</HI> he has a <HI>fini&s;hing &s;troke,</HI> in p. 32, which is,
<PB N="65" REF="012984_0071_0F903E94375A6900">that they mu&s;t not pre&s;ume to vote, unle&s; they "can &s;ay upon their <HI>con&s;ciences,</HI> that the practice <HI>&s;prung from</HI> HELL."&mdash;<HI>Such</HI> was Mr. C.'s manner of treating this affair, at the church meeting. And all the while, appeared to be in as great heat and vehemence of tem|per, as I ever &s;aw a man, on any &s;uch like occa&s;ion, in my life. This was not barely my own, but the ob&s;ervation of multitudes that heard and &s;aw him. The&s;e are facts, which &s;hould never have been made more publick by me, had not Mr. C. really <HI>obliged</HI> me to it, to vin|dicate my&s;elf from tho&s;e <HI>charges</HI> which he has thrown out again&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in his <HI>bitter remarks</HI> upon the <HI>letters;</HI> which have made it <HI>nece&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI> that I &s;hould thus let the world know the <HI>particular rea&s;ons</HI> of my conduct, e&s;pecially in writing that <HI>letter,</HI> which he has endeavoured to repre&s;ent to his readers, in &s;uch terrible colours.</P>
<P>And now I beg the reader's patience, while we take a view of the ANSWER Mr. C. returned to my letter, and his conduct thereupon. There are a great variety of things &s;ugge&s;ted in <HI>his letter,</HI> which have no ju&s;t foundation. 'Tis intimated particularly, here and el&s;ewhere by him, that I had turned away, or <HI>refu&s;ed</HI> per&s;ons who came to me to de&s;ire to <HI>own the covenant.</HI> He in&s;tances in <HI>one per&s;on,</HI> by name, towards the beginning of his letter&mdash;but without <HI>his</HI> knowledge, I am well a&s;&s;ured. And who he had his information from, I am not able to &s;ay. For that per&s;on, (who is a man of an unexceptionable cha|racter, &s;o far as I know, or have ever heard) has told me &s;ince, that he never had told any per&s;on whatever, that I had <HI>refu&s;ed</HI> him; neither did he even look upon it that I had <HI>denied him,</HI> any more than I had denied the <HI>whole congregation.</HI> He has indeed frequently di&s;cour&s;ed with me on the affair in debate, as many others have&mdash;and has wi&s;hed that it might be peaceably &s;ettled&mdash;and if &s;o, that he &s;hould be glad to enjoy the priviledge of <HI>bapti&s;m</HI> for his children. But as Mr. C. has repre&s;ented the matter, there is not the lea&s;t foundation for it; as the per&s;on him&s;elf will willingly declare, (as he has told me) to any one's &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Mr. C. has al&s;o, in <HI>this letter,</HI> given a very wrong turn to an ex|pre&s;&s;ion of mine, concerning <HI>the mo&s;t godly among us,</HI> being on our &s;ide the que&s;tion. It will appear, I think, to every one who will attend to the <HI>whole</HI> of what I &s;aid there, that I had a <HI>plain</HI> and <HI>prin|ciple</HI> reference to <HI>tho&s;e</HI> in the church, who cannot <HI>act</HI> in the affair. (See po&s;t&s;cript of my fir&s;t letter.) But if any &s;hould think, my <HI>man|ner</HI> of expre&s;&s;ion conveys an idea of <HI>judging</HI> or <HI>condemning</HI> any of the church; or a <HI>publick</HI> preferring one before another, who are
<PB N="66" REF="012984_0072_0F903E9585F57B70">profe&s;&s;ed chri&s;tians&mdash;I neither intended nor allow of any &s;uch thing; nor do I think it ju&s;tifiable, whatever our <HI>private</HI> judgment may be.</P>
<P>I don't know what rea&s;on Mr. C. had to in&s;inuate that I am "not enough <HI>acquainted</HI> with my people to judge who are <HI>experienced,</HI> good chri&s;tians and who are not." If it be &s;o, I tru&s;t he won't &s;ay, he a&s;&s;erts this from <HI>his own</HI> knowledge or acquaintance with them. Neither do I think he would have uttered &s;uch a &s;entence, if he had felt <HI>good natured,</HI> or of a chri&s;tian temper.</P>
<P>As to what he has &s;aid re&s;pecting the <HI>women</HI> of the church&mdash;it has been hinted to me, that &s;ome have under&s;tood his expre&s;&s;ions, as if he <HI>de&s;igned</HI> to ca&s;t &s;ome reflection or <HI>odium</HI> upon my character&mdash;If that <HI>was</HI> his de&s;ign, I have a right to expect and demand an explana|tion from him. Tho' I acknowledge it did not enter into <HI>my</HI> mind, that <HI>that</HI> was his intention, or that any one would under&s;tand the words in &s;uch a light.</P>
<P>But what &s;urprized me mo&s;t of all was, that group of extravagant expre&s;&s;ions in p. 41, where he &s;peaks of my "thundering <HI>Anathema,</HI> authoratively denounced again&s;t him, for advancing &s;uch <HI>pernicious, &s;oul-damning, de&s;tructive</HI> doctrines." Will the reader believe it, that <HI>not one</HI> of the&s;e violen expre&s;&s;ions is contained in my whole let|ter? But what was it then, that cau&s;ed this vehement outcry? Why truly, 'twas becau&s;e I was &s;o audacious as to &s;ay, "I could not in con|&s;cience <HI>encourage the in&s;tructions of tho&s;e</HI> who advanced &s;uch doctrines, among a people, the charge of who&s;e immortal intere&s;ts was com|mitted to me;" becau&s;e I looked upon them of <HI>dangerous tendency.</HI> This was the <HI>thundering anathema,</HI> and this was all.</P>
<P>Furthermore, what a &s;trained con&s;truction does he put upon the abovementioned expre&s;&s;ion of mine, &s;aying 'it equally involved the <HI>brethren,</HI> and that I had <HI>virtually</HI> excommunicated half the church at once." What I becau&s;e I looked upon <HI>his</HI> doctrines as dangerous in their <HI>con&s;equences</HI> and tendency, therefore I charge the <HI>brethren</HI> with <HI>embracing</HI> them. When, in truth, I was &s;o far from it, that I did not even &s;uppo&s;e, that <HI>Mr. C. him&s;elf,</HI> was aware of tho&s;e <HI>con|&s;equences,</HI> or would e&s;pou&s;e them.</P>
<P>Again, I can't but take notice of that unchri&s;tian reflection in p. 43. where he in&s;inuates, that I am guilty of <HI>partiality</HI> in admitting per|&s;ons to own the covenant, or to communion. "E&s;pecially <HI>tho&s;e of note,</HI>" &s;ays he. My own con&s;cience is witne&s;s, and I tru&s;t a higher power &s;till, that I have ever made it my practice in affairs of this &s;acred importance, to treat <HI>all alike:</HI> whether they be <HI>per&s;ons of note,</HI> or not; to make no de&s;tinction between high and low, rich or poor.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="012984_0073_0F903E970D295AB0">
There are &s;everal things in the remarkable <HI>po&s;tjeript</HI> to his letter, which al&s;o merit ob&s;ervation. Mr C. can better give the rea&s;on tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> I, why he in&s;inuates that "I had a mind <HI>to leave" my people:</HI> After 'tis notoriou&s;ly known, that I had publickly declared the contrary; that I had no de&s;ire, but to &s;pend my life with this people, if I could live in peace, and there was any pro&s;pect of my being &s;erviceable to their be&s;t intere&s;t: And that all reports to the contrary, were groundle&s;s.</P>
<P>Another thing Mr. C. has implicitly charged me with is, <HI>breaking open a letter,</HI> &s;ent to him from my father. This has been indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly propagated and aggravated by &s;ome per&s;ons. 'Tis nece&s;&s;ary therefore the truth &s;hould be known. The <HI>letter</HI> to Mr. C. was &s;ent inclo&s;ed to me&mdash;and <HI>un&s;ealed</HI>&mdash;with my father's expre&s;s de&s;ire that I would look it over, and &s;ee whether I thought it might an&s;wer any good end to &s;end it. If not, (as I knew the circum&s;tances of affairs here better than he did) he directed me to &s;uppre&s;s or de&s;troy it&mdash;and left it wholly with me, to conduct as I tho't mo&s;t proper in the matter, This is the whole truth of the affair; which I am ready to make ap|pear to any one that de&s;ires it, by my father's letter, which I now have by me. I era&s;ed two &s;hort pa&s;&s;ages&mdash;and &s;hould be as willing the world &s;hould know what they were as not, were they in the <HI>lea&s;t degree</HI> material to the pre&s;ent controver&s;y&mdash;but they are not, as Mr. C. him&s;elf knows, who has &s;ince heard them.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, this <HI>Po&s;t&s;cript,</HI> I apprehend, will appear, to every one who attends to and compares it with what it refers to, a mo&s;t peculiar one of its kind. Mr. C. has, indeed by <HI>inverted commas</HI> given his readers to under&s;tand, that he <HI>quotes</HI> the &s;entences from <HI>my letter.</HI> Whether his quotations are ju&s;t, or whether he has not perverted my meaning almo&s;t in every pa&s;&s;age, the reader will be&s;t judge, by only comparing it with my letter. He has, be&s;ure, repre&s;ented my letter, in a very frightful light. But I do not <HI>own</HI> the letter in this dre&s;s. He has certainly &s;tripped it of the garb that belonged to it, and has dre&s;&s;ed it up in one of his own manufacture; terrible enough, I ac|knowledge; and then &s;eems to have viewed and reviewed it, in this ugly hue, till he had got quite out of all patience, and, as if unable to contain any longer, he at length breaks forth in &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions as the&s;e&mdash;<HI>thundering anathema&mdash;&s;oul-damning doctrines&mdash;fini&s;hed hypocrite&mdash;lawyer like&mdash;a&s;&s;uming the prerogative of God&mdash;the ranke&s;t &s;epera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&mdash;raw, un&s;tudied&mdash;young man,</HI> &amp;c. But pray let us for a moment, get away from the noi&s;e of a torrent, and calmly enquire, <HI>what it is</HI> that occa&s;ioned all this vehemence of &s;pirit, and expre&s;&s;ion? It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="68" REF="012984_0074_0F903E9750AFC250">to have ari&s;en, &s;o far as I can find out, from the&s;e <HI>two things,</HI> viz. My &s;aying that I looked upon &s;ome things he had advanced, to be of an <HI>arminian tendency</HI>&mdash;and that I could not <HI>encourage the in&s;truc|tions</HI> of tho&s;e, that promoted <HI>&s;uch principles.</HI> The&s;e two things, 'tis evident, are the chief, which he appears &s;o exceedingly to re&s;ent; as if I had herein been guilty of the highe&s;t crime that could po&s;&s;ibly be committed again&s;t a mortal. But I think a per&s;on mu&s;t be of a very irritable di&s;po&s;ition, to conceive &s;uch poignan re&s;entment at ex|pre&s;&s;ions like tho&s;e above.</P>
<P>There are but two other things, which I &s;hall particularly notice in <HI>this letter.</HI> One is, his repre&s;enting that I had "been <HI>obliged to retract</HI> &s;ome opinions which I formely held." And the per&s;on I <HI>learned</HI> them of, he politely tells me, was <HI>Bellamy.</HI> Without re|marking upon the manner in which Mr. C. has here and el&s;ewhere treated that divine; I can inform him and the world if nece&s;&s;ary,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That I never e&s;pou&s;ed any principles, merely becau&s;e they were held by Dr <HI>Bellamy,</HI> or any other man.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That I have never, &s;ince I have been in this place, <HI>retracted</HI> or &s;een cau&s;e to retract any &s;entiments in divinity, which I had "formerly h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ld"&mdash;as I have thought them, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ill think them agreeable to the word of God.</ITEM>
<ITEM>And 3. If I am convinced that any &s;entiment I have e&s;pou&s;ed, is <HI>un&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">riptural,</HI> I hope I &s;hall always be willing to "retract it," without being <HI>"obliged"</HI> to it; and &s;hall look upon &s;uch a retractation, not a reproach, as it &s;eems here to have been intended, but as an <HI>honor</HI> to me.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The other thing is, the <HI>la&s;t paragraph</HI> in Mr. C.'s letter, which was wrote upon the <HI>&s;abbath,</HI> April 12th. Upon which I ob&s;erve, that it appears to &s;avour, not of a very chri&s;tian &s;pirit; and morover is a <HI>mi&s;repre&s;entation</HI> of the matter: at lea&s;t, &s;uch a repre&s;entation, as will naturally give a &s;tranger a wrong idea. I, no doubt, did u&s;e tho&s;e words of the Apo&s;tle, which he mentions; but not in the <HI>man|ner,</HI> or with the <HI>de&s;ign</HI> he &s;ugge&s;ts. And is it not very hard, to have it <HI>flung</HI> at me, in the manner Mr. C. has done in his <HI>marginal note</HI> upon it? "in a <HI>&s;ever</HI> (&s;ays he) as <HI>his manner is</HI> when <HI>moved.</HI>" So that if ever I feel any <HI>impre&s;&s;ive &s;en&s;e</HI> of divine things upon my own mind, I mu&s;t take care not to di&s;cover it, nor appear with any degree of <HI>earne&s;tne&s;s</HI> in prayer or preaching, lea&s;t I &s;hould be reproached with <HI>being "in a &s;ever</HI> as my <HI>manner is."</HI> How does it look, for one who has been an <HI>old mini&s;ter,</HI> (but now a hearer) to &s;it as a captious <HI>critick</HI> under the mini&s;try of a <HI>young man,</HI> carping at his expre&s;&s;ions, and finding fault, with no other grounds than he has mentioned above?
<PB N="69" REF="012984_0075_0F903E9806E9CA68">How di&s;couraging mu&s;t it be, to be always expo&s;ed to &s;uch <HI>cants</HI> as the&s;e&mdash;that "if he lived to the age of <HI>Methu&s;aleh,</HI> he would not de|clare the <HI>whole coun&s;el</HI> of God," if he did not make more ha&s;te about it, than he had done&mdash;That he had never "preached <HI>fifteen twen|tieths</HI> of the heads of divinity" which a mini&s;ter ought to preach, &amp;c. If the&s;e things are true, I am indeed very much to blame, I acknowledge. But is it not a little &s;trange, that <HI>no others</HI> of the congregation &s;hould have found this out, and complained of it for years pa&s;t? Or if it was becau&s;e Mr. C. had &s;o much more knowledge and di&s;cerning than the re&s;t, that he di&s;covered it, what can be the rea&s;on that he had never mentioned it before? Why did he not, in a friendly manner, hint it to me, that I might <HI>amend</HI> for the future; e&s;pecially &s;ince we had "held a good corre&s;pondence" before; and &s;ince this has been &s;uch "matter of grievance to him for years" pa&s;t? and was "no &s;udden ebullition of pa&s;&s;ion?" But if he thought it was owing to my <HI>igno|rance,</HI> and that I was not <HI>able</HI> to handle tho&s;e points, why does he <HI>expo&s;e</HI> my weakne&s;s, and publi&s;h it to the world?&mdash;But, if I may be allowed to di&s;&s;ent from Mr. C. I mu&s;t &s;ay, that his a&s;&s;ertion there, is not according to the truth of fact. And that "it is in my power to prove it," not "by an <HI>interleaved almanack,</HI>" but from <HI>others</HI> of my hearers, who will be allowed to have <HI>&s;ome</HI> under&s;tanding, as well as Mr. Cotton, and al&s;o by <HI>my own notes.</HI> So that I think I have good right to <HI>appeal</HI> from his <HI>almanacks,</HI> to a more impartial te&s;t: and the more &s;o, becau&s;e he has <HI>one or two texts</HI> &s;et down (by his own account) which I <HI>never did preach from.</HI> I have rea&s;on there|fore, to call in que&s;tion the <HI>authenticity</HI> of his records, and to look upon his "interleaved almanack" as apocriphal and not genuine.</P>
<P>Another remark he has, of much the &s;ame nature, in the margin of the next page; where he repeats an a&s;&s;ertion he had, in his <HI>former letter,</HI> viz. "That his <HI>brethren all think</HI> as he does." If this be rightly and truly expre&s;&s;ed, I own, I am entirely ignorant of the minds of <HI>all the members</HI> of the church re&s;pecting this debate; and can have no idea of the difference between a <HI>negative</HI> and an <HI>affirmative.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Cotton, in the following page 50, exhibits to his readers fur|ther proofs of his kindne&s;s and friend&s;hip to me, in a catalogue of charges he has drawn up; at the clo&s;e of which, he tells his readers, he "mentions the&s;e things <HI>not to expo&s;e me,</HI> but to <HI>prevent</HI> the like for time to come." It &s;eems 'tis a <HI>preventive</HI> potion which he here intended to admini&s;ter: I wi&s;h it's operation may be &s;alutary; tho' I mu&s;t acknowledge, the <HI>ingredients</HI> &s;eem to be &s;omewhat <HI>better</HI>&mdash;
<PB N="70" REF="012984_0076_0F903E98CF4491C0">I &s;hall not trouble the reader by repeating the &s;everal <HI>articles of charge,</HI> in this catalogue: But only ob&s;erve, in general, that there is a mixture of <HI>mi&s;repre&s;entation, &s;u&s;picion</HI> and <HI>jealou&s;y;</HI> things which are <HI>&s;urmi&s;ed,</HI> without the lea&s;t foundation: Particularly what he has &s;aid of my <HI>praying</HI> at the church-meeting&mdash;"&s;ermon of triumph"&mdash; <HI>p&s;alms</HI> being &s;ung at him, &amp;c. They are too low and even ridiculous to mention. I can with truth declare, that during the whole of the&s;e debates, I have never once, either prayed, &s;ung or preached with any de&s;ign to di&s;gu&s;t Mr. C. or any one el&s;e&mdash;but have always endea|voured to avoid every thing that might be looked upon as <HI>pointed,</HI> or intended to irritate. The <HI>p&s;alms</HI> were &s;ung in cour&s;e. As to the <HI>&s;ermon,</HI> which he intimates was made in a way of <HI>triumph</HI> after the <HI>church-meeting,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>That &s;ermon</HI> was made above a month be|fore the church-meeting had an exi&s;tence; and therefore before I could po&s;&s;ibly know (or even &s;u&s;pected) what would be done at that meeting. I utterly deny the charge, of it's being my "u&s;ual phra&s;e to &s;ay <HI>"my friends</HI> and <HI>my enemies."</HI>&mdash;What Mr. C. &s;ays, likewi&s;e, in the <HI>po&s;t&s;cript</HI> of his <HI>little</HI> letter, p. 51, I am certain he has no grounds for, from <HI>his own</HI> knowledge. And if he had it by <HI>informa|tion,</HI> is there not &s;ome danger, that his <HI>informer</HI> has had as great a &s;hare in the "tri&s;ting di&s;cour&s;e" as any one el&s;e? As to his letter being "&s;ent back opened," this is a very great mi&s;take&mdash;It might po&s;&s;ibly be opened in his own family, before <HI>he</HI> received it&mdash;but it was never opened in mine; but immediately returned to him <HI>unopened</HI> and un|&s;een by any per&s;on in my family&mdash;And I &s;hould probably never have been favoured with the <HI>contents</HI> of it, <HI>the challenge,</HI> &amp;c. but as he has &s;een &s;it to publi&s;h it, with the other letters. As to the <HI>manner</HI> and <HI>&s;tyle</HI> of of it, I leave the reader to make his own remarks on them&mdash;and pa&s;s</P>
<P>To take &s;ome notice of <HI>his</HI> REMARKS <HI>on the&s;e letters</HI>&mdash;p. 51. 52, &amp;c. Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> intimates, that before the&s;e <HI>letters,</HI> "we held a <HI>good corre&s;pondence."</HI> Of HIS <HI>friendly di&s;po&s;ition</HI> towards me, the reader might be better able to judge, perhaps, if I were (after his example) to publi&s;h a <HI>private letter,</HI> which he &s;ent me by way of cha&s;ti&s;ement, many years ago, for a part of my conduct <HI>as a mini&s;ter,</HI> which I never was faulted for, but by Mr. C. He has, indeed, &s;ince that time, &s;hewn in&s;tances of kindne&s;s and friend&s;hip; which I ac|knowledge with gratitude. And be&s;ure, I could &s;carcely have believed <HI>then,</HI> that it were po&s;&s;ible he could have &s;aid and done tho&s;e things, which, <HI>&s;ince,</HI> we have had but too &s;ad occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve,
<PB N="71" REF="012984_0077_0F903E9999634C50">I cannot therefore, but have rea&s;on to apprehend, from all that has appeared of late, that he has long had &s;ome <HI>root of prejudice</HI> again&s;t me&mdash;and that nothing was wanting but an opportunity for it to ma|nife&s;t it&s;elf, as it has now done. I wi&s;h I may be mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>provocation</HI> given by <HI>my letter;</HI> I can truly &s;ay, I never meant or intended that <HI>abu&s;e</HI> of him, which he complains of; or to "begin any quarrel" with him; whatever his jealous mind may have &s;ugge&s;ted. Neither am I now at all di&s;po&s;ed to <HI>keep up</HI> a variance. I de&s;ire nothing but peace and reconciliation. I &s;hould be &s;incerely glad to have Mr. C. return to us, with a <HI>kind, charitable, chri&s;tian</HI> &s;pirit; and that <HI>we</HI> might, with the &s;ame &s;pirit receive him, and live and walk as brethren. I never purpo&s;ely did any thing to drive him away. And &s;ince his withdraw, I have endeavoured a <HI>reconciliation,</HI> in the pre&s;ence of a number of the church&mdash;the greater part of whom &s;aid, and &s;till &s;ay, that the terms I offered and propo&s;als I made, were, in their opinion, rea&s;onable and &s;ufficient, and agreeable to the go&s;pel&mdash;that they &s;hould de&s;ire no more, had they been the offended; and yet Mr. C. refu&s;es to be reconciled and to return.</P>
<P>I think the account he has given of this matter p. 53, is far from being &s;o impartial and full, and it ought to be. The fact was this. At a meeting of a number of the brethren at my hou&s;e with him, in order to confer and endeavour to heal this unhappy per&s;onal breach; after the affair was opened by Mr. C. I told him, I was &s;orry for the unhappy difference that &s;eemed to &s;ub&s;i&s;t between us, and was willing to do any thing that was rea&s;onable and &s;criptural, for an accommo|dation; and would make <HI>this propo&s;al</HI>&mdash;viz. "Being &s;en&s;ible that it has been a day of <HI>temptation</HI> and <HI>controver&s;y</HI> among us, wherein we had <HI>both,</HI> no doubt, &s;aid and done many things which are wrong, and which, at another time, we &s;hould not have done&mdash;Let us now mutually <HI>forgive</HI> each other, and bury all that has been ami&s;e, cover|ing each others faults and failings with a <HI>mantle' of love and charity</HI>&mdash;I am heartily willing to do it my&s;elf, and de&s;ire the &s;ame of you; and hereafter let us love and live like brethren." <HI>This</HI> was what I offered him&mdash;and <HI>this</HI> he utterly refu&s;ed; and let me know, that unle&s;s I would go into <HI>particulars,</HI> and bring over &s;undry <HI>articles</HI> of grievance that he had again&s;t me, he would not make up the matter. I told him I was not willing to that, and refu&s;ed to do it; and that the only objection I had to it was, that it would tend only to <HI>exa&s;pe|rate,</HI> on both &s;ides&mdash;that raking open the <HI>coals</HI> would &s;erve but to e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">crea&s;e the heat, in&s;tead of quenching the fire&mdash;and that the only
<PB N="72" REF="012984_0078_0F903E9A60C724D0">way, therefore, in the judgment of <HI>others,</HI> (both <HI>mini&s;ters</HI> and <HI>bre|thren</HI>) as well as my&s;elf, would be mutually to a&s;k and grant for|givene&s;s&mdash; This I was free to do&mdash;and thought it mo&s;t rea&s;onable that <HI>he</HI> &s;hould comply with it; e&s;pecially con&s;idering the injurious treatment, I thought, he had given me &s;o frequently before. He &s;ays, I thought it a <HI>conde&s;cention</HI> in me to make this propo&s;al. I acknow|ledge it&mdash;and do now think &s;o&mdash;and am very far from being alone, in my judgment, among tho&s;e who have been mo&s;t acquainted with our affairs. But be it a conde&s;cention or no conde&s;cention, I won't di&s;|pute that matter with him. I think it a <HI>rea&s;onable</HI> and <HI>chri&s;tian</HI> propo&s;al; and am willing &s;till to comply with it. Mr. C. after this, per&s;i&s;ted &s;till to <HI>refu&s;e</HI> to con&s;ent to it; and pull'd out of his pocket a <HI>paper,</HI> containing three or four <HI>confe&s;&s;ions</HI> for me to make; or ar|ticles of grievance, for which he expected I make a di&s;tinct <HI>acknow|ledgment.</HI> I told him I did not think &s;it to comply with his reque&s;t&mdash;and withal a&s;ked him if he thought HE was &s;o entirely innocent, as that he ought to make no <HI>conce&s;&s;ions</HI> on <HI>his</HI> part? His an&s;wer was in the&s;e words, <HI>"I &s;hall not an&s;wer that que&s;tion."</HI> And thus the affair, in &s;hort, ended; and thus it remains.</P>
<P>There are innumerable other pa&s;&s;ages in Mr. Cotton's writings and conduct, which manife&s;t how <HI>little</HI> he thinks <HI>him&s;elf to blame</HI> through the whole affair&mdash;how quick to cen&s;ure and condemn others and to ju&s;tify him&s;elf; to <HI>aggravate</HI> the faults of his brethren and to <HI>le&s;&s;en</HI> and even annihilate his own. An in&s;tance, among many others, of this, we may &s;ee in p. 52, 53. "Mr. <HI>Robbins</HI> may <HI>thank him&s;elf</HI> IF I have been provoked to &s;peak &s;ometimes too har&s;hly," <HI>If</HI> I have. Nay, he brings it out, and &s;ays plainly p. 54. "I was not con&s;cious I had wronged him at all." And again, "I am <HI>not con&s;cious</HI> I have exceeded <HI>chri&s;tian bounds</HI> in my treatment of Mr. R." Perhaps <HI>others</HI> may be better judges of that, than Mr. C. or I. Be it as it may, it is certain, that mo&s;t people among us happen to differ much from his judgment in this matter.</P>
<P>But what a remarkable talent has he, on the other hand, at finding out crimes in <HI>others</HI> and making mountains of molehills. In p. 70, under his 11th ob&s;ervation, he charges me with "&s;eeing with others eyes'&mdash;never "examining for my&s;elf"&mdash;and &s;o I am condemned as not being "a lover of truth;" only becau&s;e I had &s;aid, that <HI>&s;ome who have turned to the pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture referred to by the</HI> SYNOD, <HI>to prove the lawfulne&s;s of</HI> THIS PRACTICE, <HI>had &s;aid, they could not &s;ee that they had proved it, or were to the purpo&s;e.</HI> Does this imply,
<PB N="73" REF="012984_0079_0F903E9B0703C6C0">that <HI>I had never ob&s;erved the &s;ame</HI> MYSELF? His ob&s;ervation or inference is truly worthy a <HI>Logician,</HI> in this in&s;tance.</P>
<P>Yet this is a mere trifle, compared with his charge again&s;t me in the next page, (marginal note) which is, that "I did in <HI>direct terms,</HI> in the face of the church, give him the LYE." This is a high charge indeed: And <HI>obliges</HI> me in vindication of my&s;elf, to &s;ay <HI>that,</HI> which I have been very loth to believe, and would now be glad, (otherwi&s;e) to have been &s;ilent about: viz. That it is a <HI>fact,</HI> that there has been much talk among us of late, of what he there refers to. <HI>Many</HI> have been of the opinion, that Mr. C. (to mention none be&s;ides) has had a <HI>de&s;ign</HI> to get me away from this people, if he could. This opinion they formed, I &s;uppo&s;e, from the whole tenor of his conduct towards me of late. But when he read his <HI>la&s;t piece</HI> at the church meeting, <HI>June</HI> 30th, (tho' the church voted twice not to hear it) I mu&s;t ac|knowledge, that by the <HI>matter</HI> and the <HI>extraordinary manner</HI> in which it was delivered, I was, more than ever before, &s;atisfied in my own mind, that <HI>tho&s;e reports</HI> were true; and that he would be glad to procure a di&s;&s;olution of my relation to this people. I grounded my opinion upon that old, but true proverb, that <HI>actions &s;peak louder than words.</HI> And I did expre&s;s this my opinion&mdash;and for <HI>this</HI> he is plea&s;ed to &s;ay, I gave him the LYE. I am per&s;waded, had any one been in my &s;ituation, and ob&s;erved the whole &s;eries of Mr. C.'s be|havior towards me at tho&s;e meetings, and <HI>&s;ince,</HI> he would be at no great lo&s;s to conjecture what he would have, if it was in his power. Po&s;&s;ibly I may be mi&s;taken; but I &s;peak as things really appear to <HI>me</HI>&mdash;and I believe to many others. However, I would &s;peak it with thankfulne&s;s to GOD, and al&s;o to my <HI>people,</HI> I have rea&s;on to believe (tho' mo&s;t unworthy) that I have as much evidence of the love and ten|der affection of my people in general, as almo&s;t any mini&s;ter whatever.&mdash;I pray that I may continue, both to de&s;erve and enjoy it. And I am not without hopes, notwith&s;tanding the late troubles, that a gracious God will, in due time, cau&s;e all animo&s;ities and divi&s;ions to cea&s;e among us; that <HI>peace</HI> may be re&s;tored, and that we may have &s;ome|thing to attend to, be&s;ides controver&s;y, even the <HI>one thing needful</HI>&mdash;that that we may <HI>know the things which belong to our peace, before they are hid from our eyes.</HI></P>
<P>As to the methods propo&s;ed in the church, for an <HI>accommodation</HI> of the publick di&s;pute, I had mentioned the following, viz. "That if the church would admit tho&s;e per&s;ons into <HI>full communion</HI> that ap|peared to be qualified to <HI>renew their bapti&s;mal covenant,</HI> I &s;hould
<PB N="74" REF="012984_0080_0F903E9C26C44930">be willing to <HI>baptize</HI> their children, tho' perhaps &s;ome of them could not &s;ee light to come <HI>immediately</HI> to the Lord's Supper." This Mr. C. "rejected with contempt," as ridiculous; &s;aying, that there would "not be one per&s;on that &s;hould vote for it, but would be <HI>a&s;hamed of it</HI> before a twelvemonth."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Had I an inclination to follow Mr. C.'s example, I might well retort and &s;ay, he has "<HI>given ME the L&mdash;e.</HI> if not &s;everal others, in the face of the church," in &s;aying "no church in the province practices any thing like it." And again,&mdash;"a report indeed we have, that <HI>one</HI> church in <HI>Connecticut</HI> hath adopted &s;ome &s;uch &s;cheme, <HI>whether true or not we cannot tell.</HI>" p. 73. Whereas I had told <HI>him</HI> and the church, publickly, that <HI>&s;ome churches had practi&s;ed</HI> in this method, both in <HI>this province</HI> and <HI>Connecticut.</HI> That I had my information from indi&s;|putable authority: In the <HI>former,</HI> from the <HI>mini&s;ter</HI> of a church that are in the practice&mdash;in the <HI>latter,</HI> from a member of our church, of un&s;potted character, who&s;e <HI>name</HI> I mentioned al&s;o, and who&s;e <HI>futher,</HI> a learned and worthy divine in <HI>Connecticut,</HI> has long been in the <HI>practice</HI> which I propo&s;ed. And yet Mr. C. is plea&s;ed to &s;ay, in the face of the&s;e &s;everal te&s;timonies, <HI>"whether 'tis true or no, we cannot tell."</HI></NOTE> I knew indeed, there were &s;ome <HI>difficulties</HI> attending the method I propo&s;ed; but I did it to avoid <HI>greater.</HI> My meaning was this&mdash;"If <HI>&s;cruples</HI> of con&s;cience call for the church's <HI>forbearance</HI> in this ca&s;e, let us <HI>forbear</HI> with them <HI>as members</HI> in covenant, not as <HI>half members.</HI> (For per&s;ons will look upon them as <HI>half members,</HI> according to the pre&s;ent practice.)

<P>On the other hand, Mr. C.'s propo&s;al was, "that a <HI>neighbouring mini&s;ter</HI> come and <HI>baptize</HI> the children of the per&s;ons in que&s;tion&mdash;and that the <HI>Deacons,</HI> or a <HI>committee</HI> of the church propound them for <HI>owning the covenant.</HI>" I told him, this was not only an <HI>innova|tion,</HI> a plan, which I had never heard of in any church before&mdash;but, it appeared to me, would be in&s;tituting a kind of <HI>new</HI> eccle&s;ia&s;tical ju|ri&s;diction: And that it would be attended with many difficulties and inconveniencies&mdash;that I doubted whether any neighbouring mini&s;ter would be willing to officiate in &s;uch circum&s;tances. And if they would, I que&s;tioned whether <HI>three per&s;ons,</HI> if a &s;ingle one, in the con|gregation would de&s;ire it&mdash;that we had never heard any thing of this kind <HI>hinted,</HI> by the per&s;ons concerned, or who were not of the church.&mdash;I did not however, treat his propo&s;al, in the <HI>contemptuous</HI> manner he has &s;ugge&s;ted: nor tell the brethren they "would be a&s;hamed of it" &s;hould they adopt it.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="012984_0081_0F903E9CAA4BC628">
I think the <HI>information</HI> Mr. C. gives, in the la&s;t page, "to tho&s;e who live at a di&s;tance," will hardly give a full idea of the manner in which "this di&s;pute terminated;" that it is a little to <HI>partial</HI> and defective. It &s;eems to convey an idea, that the church meeting was <HI>di&s;&s;olved</HI> for the &s;ake of peace, but not to the &s;atisfaction of the <HI>pa&s;tor</HI>&mdash;that I remained <HI>"un&s;atisfied."</HI> It is well known that I was not at all <HI>un&s;atisfied</HI> with the di&s;&s;olution of the meeting; but was very <HI>de&s;irous</HI> of it&mdash;that I had long tho't, as well as above three quarters of the church, that the&s;e <HI>church meetings</HI> rather <HI>hurt</HI> than <HI>promoted</HI> the peace of both church and town: And that a <HI>di&s;&s;olution,</HI> would, we had rea&s;on to hope, put an end to the unhappy di&s;cords among us, at lea&s;t for the pre&s;ent. It is al&s;o as well known, that Mr. C. appeared greatly <HI>di&s;&s;atisfied</HI> with the church's propo&s;al to di&s;&s;olve the meeting and &s;trove again&s;t it with great vehemence. And that there never had been &s;o much warmth and unchri&s;tian heat, at all our meetings before, as at this time. (We have all of us rea&s;on to think and &s;peak of it with &s;hame.) The occa&s;ion of it, 'tis evident, was, the <HI>oppo&s;i|tion</HI> that was made to <HI>di&s;&s;olving</HI> the meeting; altho' the <HI>declared de&s;ign</HI> of it was, <HI>for the &s;ake of peace.</HI> A paper had been, for this end, drawn up a day or two before the <HI>la&s;t meeting,</HI> and &s;igned by more than half the church&mdash;not by con&s;traint or per&s;wa&s;ion, but wil|lingly&mdash;the purport of which was, "con&s;idering the unhappy di&s;putes that have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in the church, and being earne&s;tly de&s;irous to <HI>re&s;tore peace,</HI> we, for this end would propo&s;e and de&s;ire that the church meeting which &s;tands adjourned to the la&s;t of <HI>June,</HI> may then be <HI>di&s;&s;olved</HI> without entering into <HI>any further debates</HI> on the affair&mdash;the church to <HI>rea&s;&s;ume</HI> the con&s;ideration thereof when they &s;hall think proper. This paper, being given into my hand at the opening of the meeting, and read, it was oppo&s;ed with the greate&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s, as mentioned above; Mr.C. in&s;i&s;ting upon <HI>reading further</HI> what he had wrote on the debate. On the other hand, the church in general, not willing to hear any thing more; as we had &s;een but too &s;ad effects of Mr. C.'s <HI>E&s;&s;ays</HI> in former meetings&mdash;and were therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">irous the matter might re&s;t at pre&s;ent, and the meeting be <HI>di&s;&s;olved</HI> in peace. However, after &s;ome debate, the <HI>que&s;tion</HI> was de&s;ired <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e put, and a vote called,&mdash;<HI>Whether the church incline to hear any thing further?</HI> It pa&s;&s;ed in the <HI>negative.</HI> After this, it being &s;u&s;pected there was &s;ome mi&s;take in the vote, it was called again, in the &s;ame words, and pa&s;&s;ed clearly in the <HI>negative</HI> again. But &s;o great were the complaints, and &s;o vehement the oppo&s;ition of Mr. C. and two or three more,
<PB N="76" REF="012984_0082_0F903EA16D6287C0">that the church, after this, did, in pure conde&s;cention to the importu|nity of the&s;e brethren, <HI>recon&s;ider</HI> their vote, and gave liberty for Mr. C. to read his <HI>la&s;t e&s;&s;ay.</HI> A&s;&s;oon as he had fini&s;hed, the que&s;tion was de|&s;ired, once more to be put, whether the meeting &s;hould be <HI>di&s;&s;olved?</HI> And it pa&s;&s;ed in the <HI>affirmative,</HI> by a much greater majority than in either of the former votes. And thus the affair now remains. And I cannot but think, that, notwith&s;tanding our difference in &s;entiments, and &s;ome pa&s;t unhappy things which have taken place among us, yet, if Mr. C. had not, "in his advanced &s;tate of life," engaged in this <HI>publick</HI> controver&s;y&mdash;and needle&s;sly publi&s;hed to the world, tho&s;e <HI>Letters</HI> with the <HI>E&s;&s;ays</HI>&mdash;(contrary I believe I may &s;afely &s;ay, to the minds of almo&s;t the whole church, and congregation too) our diffi|culties would have &s;oon &s;ub&s;ided, and matters return to their former peaceful &s;tate. But his publi&s;hing <HI>this book,</HI> as it had a natural ten|dency to renew the&s;e things in peoples minds, to exa&s;perate their &s;pirits, and to blow up the <HI>coals</HI> of contention; &s;o it has been followed with &s;ome other unhappy effects, which otherwi&s;e, would never have taken place.</P>
<P>What the i&s;&s;ue of the&s;e things will be now; is known only by him who rules the world in infinite wi&s;dom and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and will govern and direct all events for his own glory and the good of his church. But it is, and ought to be matter of comfort to all that wi&s;h well to Zion, that while the church, like the <HI>ark</HI> of old, is &s;urround|ed with waters, and many times <HI>to&s;&s;ed</HI> up and down by <HI>&s;torms</HI> and <HI>tempe&s;ts,</HI> yet JESUS CHRIST &s;its at helm; and <HI>the Lord on high, is mightier than the noi&s;e of many waters;</HI> and can &s;ay to them, <HI>Peace, be &s;till!</HI>&mdash;For <HI>this,</HI> let the <HI>children of Zion</HI> pray; and at all times, <HI>be joyful in their King.</HI></P>
<P>I have now, but to reque&s;t earne&s;tly, the prayers of all that love the intere&s;t and kingdom of Chri&s;t and the edification and peace of his members; that God would, in his tender mercy, <HI>vi&s;it this vine,</HI> which we tru&s;t, <HI>his own right hand hath planted</HI>&mdash;that he would give to more and more of the &s;pirit and temper of the go&s;pel&mdash;unite our hearts in brotherly kindne&s;s and charity, and grant that we may all meet at la&s;t, in that holy world, where the church of CHRIST are <HI>one</HI> in &s;entiment and affection.</P>
