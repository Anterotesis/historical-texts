<P>THESE <HI>Words</HI> begin a Triumphant <HI>P&s;alm</HI> of <HI>David</HI>'s, the <HI>Subject</HI> whereof is the Maje&s;ty and Pow|er and Mercies of God, di&s;play'd in the Salvations of his Church, pa&s;t and to come. The <HI>Triumphs</HI> of the GOD of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> are here Celebrated, in a <HI>Style</HI> and Ex|pre&s;&s;ion <HI>Lofty</HI> like the <HI>Place</HI> wherein He dwells, and <HI>Great</HI> as the <HI>Works</HI> they prai&s;e. There is a Mixture of <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> and <HI>Prophe&s;ie,</HI> a <HI>Review</HI> of the Glorious things which God had wro't for his Church from the days of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and a Predicti|on of the greater Salvation by the MESSIAH to come; His Victorious and Triumphant <HI>A&s;|cention,</HI> and leading <HI>Captivity Captive. v.</HI> 18.</P>

The <HI>Occa&s;ion</HI> of the <HI>P&s;alm</HI> &s;eems very obvious, tho' particular-Pa&s;&s;ages in it are Intricate and Perplex'd; &s;o that One of the <HI>Criticks</HI> &s;aid of it, <Q>that there are almo&s;t as many Shelfs and Labyrinths in it, as there are Ver&s;es and Words, and that it merits to be called the Tryal of the Wits of Interpreters, and their di&s;grace:</Q> Yet (I &s;ay) the Occa&s;ion of the <HI>P&s;alm</HI> &s;eems very plain, and that it was Compo|&s;ed for and u&s;ed at that Illu&s;trious <HI>Solemnity</HI> in <HI>David's</HI> Reign, the Tran&s;lation of the <HI>Ark of the Covenant</HI> from the <HI>Hou&s;e of Obed-Edom</HI> unto <HI>Zi|on;</HI> for the words of the <HI>Text,</HI> which are the <HI>Exordium</HI> of the <HI>P&s;alm,</HI> are the very &s;ame that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> always u&s;ed at the <HI>Removal</HI> of the <HI>Ark:</HI> Numb. 10.35. <HI>And it came to pa&s;s when the Ark &s;et forward, that Mo&s;es &s;aid, Ri&s;e up,</HI> LORD, <HI>and let thine Enemies be &s;cattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee!</HI></P>
<P>This then was the <HI>Original</HI> of the <HI>Text,</HI> being the words of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> the Lords <HI>Prophet,</HI> and the fir&s;t <HI>Ruler</HI> of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and Ancient as the <HI>fir&s;t Re|demption</HI> of His Church, and the days of their <HI>Travels</HI> in the <HI>Wilderne&s;s;</HI> where the Lord <HI>Led his People like a Flock, by the hand of Mo&s;es and Aaron.</HI> As &s;oon as the <HI>Tabernacle</HI> was <HI>reared up,</HI> and the <HI>Ark of the Te&s;timony</HI> was in its place, <HI>&amp;c, Then a Cloud covered the Tent of the Congregation, and the Glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle. The Cloud of the Lord was upon it by day, and Fire was on it by night, in the &s;ight of all the Hou&s;e of I&s;rael,
<PB N="3" REF="001294_0005_0FB27C0707CC6238">thro'out all their Journeys. And when the Cloud was taken up from over the Tabernacle, the Children of I&s;rael went onward in all their Journeys: But if the Cloud were not taken up, then they Journyed not, till the day that it was taken up.</HI> No doubt it was a very joyful &s;ight to that People when the <HI>Cloud</HI> ro&s;e up, God therein appearing to 'em to be making good his <HI>Promi&s;e,</HI> and leading them to <HI>Canaan:</HI> And the <HI>Phra&s;e</HI> agree to their very <HI>&s;ight, Ri&s;e up Lord!</HI> for there was a vi&s;ible Ap|pearance to their <HI>Sen&s;es</HI> of his doing &s;o, as the <HI>Cloud was taken up.</HI></P>
<P>It is very probable, that this <HI>Form of Prayer</HI> at the <HI>taking up</HI> of the <HI>Ark,</HI> was by Divine Ap|pointment to be <HI>for ever u&s;ed</HI> on this Occa&s;ion and Solemnity, as often as the <HI>Levites</HI> &s;hou'd e|ver be called in all future Generations to Offici|ate in <HI>Bearing the Ark:</HI> At lea&s;t 'tis pa&s;t doubt that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> at fir&s;t &s;pake the&s;e words by <HI>In&s;pirati|on,</HI> and In&s;pir'd <HI>David</HI> retaining them as the mo&s;t Apt and Ancient, and the be&s;t that could be on the great Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>This Famous <HI>Prayer</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of <HI>two Petitions,</HI> one giving the Rea&s;on of the other.</P>
<P><HI>Let God ari&s;e.</HI> It is &s;poken after the manner of men, as when we implore &s;peedy Succour of another, we &s;uppo&s;e his <HI>Ri&s;ing</HI> and ha&s;t'ning to our Relief. 'Tis a <HI>Phra&s;e</HI> u&s;ual in Scrip|ture, and Significant of Gods affording timely and pre&s;ent Help unto His People who tru&s;t in him; and equally of his taking &s;peedy Venge|ance
<PB N="4" REF="001294_0006_0FB27C0964E42720">of His and their Enemies.

<P>To both <HI>Sen&s;es</HI> the <HI>Phra&s;e</HI> is nece&s;&s;arily deter|mined in the <HI>Text:</HI> The <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> is implied, <HI>&s;oil.</HI> Gods timely appearing for the Protection and Defence of his People; for the <HI>Ark</HI> (at the Removes of which the <HI>Words</HI> were uttered) was the Glorious and Special<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 132.8. 1 Sam. 4.3. a Sam. 15.24, 25.

<PB N="5" REF="001294_0007_0FB27C0ACFFE9AC0">great to &s;uffer it, and he had a more ju&s;t appre|hen&s;ion of a right Tru&s;t in God, then to build meerly on the outward &s;ign of Gods Pre&s;ence and Power.</P>
<P>The <HI>other Sen&s;e</HI> is in words expre&s;&s;ed: <HI>Let God ari&s;e, and let his Enemies be &s;cattered, let them al&s;o that hate him flee before him.</HI> This is the Expre&s;s <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> of the Petition, that the Enemies of God might be put to Confu&s;ion and Flight, be bro't to Ruine and De&s;truction upon his <HI>Ari&s;ing.</HI></P>
<P>Ob&s;erve here, <HI>That the Enemies and Haters of God are One;</HI> and &s;o likewi&s;e are the Enemies of <HI>God</HI> and <HI>I&s;rael</HI> One: tho&s;e that hate his <HI>Church</HI> hate <HI>him,</HI> and 'tis a mo&s;t Con&s;olatory Co&s;idera|tion that the Great GOD holds 'em to do &s;o.</P>
<P>Yet note, that they are con&s;idered here as <HI>Gods Enemies,</HI> and not <HI>Ours</HI> per&s;onally: The E|nemies of his Name and Glory, his Truth and Cau&s;e, his Church and Kingdom, and that Im|placably; <HI>As &s;uch,</HI> Vengeance is here impreca|ted on them, and again&s;t &s;uch we may &amp; ought to pray: 'Tis <HI>be&s;t</HI> to carry 'em to God, &amp; leave 'em to his Judgments written again&s;t 'em.</P>
<P>And you cannot but remark the high <HI>Devo|tion</HI> &amp; flaming <HI>Zeal,</HI> which this Prayer breathes: Such a Zeal for Gods Honour, and &s;uch Love to his Intere&s;t and People, as God who is here invok'd is wont Him&s;elf to expre&s;s. And what a <HI>Noble Tru&s;t</HI> and Dependance on God alone is here expre&s;&s;'d! <HI>Let God ari&s;e!</HI> they look to Him, they build on his Appearing for them, and not
<PB N="6" REF="001294_0008_0FB27C0D25A544A0">on any <HI>Arm of Fle&s;h. Finally,</HI> The words &s;peak a mo&s;t glorious <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Confidence; Let God a|ri&s;e, let his Enemies be &s;cattered, i. e.</HI> Let God a|ri&s;e and they <HI>will</HI> be &s;o, they <HI>&s;hall</HI> be &s;o, there needs nothing more to di&s;comfit 'em: and &s;o indeed the <HI>Hebrew</HI> runs, in the <HI>Future Ten&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Thus I have as <HI>briefly</HI> as I cou'd <HI>fully,</HI> &s;et this Copious Prayer in its true Light: You ea&s;ily &s;ee how fruitful it is of Noble &amp; Divine <HI>Truths,</HI> and how many rich <HI>Ob&s;ervations</HI> I might offer from it; I &s;hall &s;elect <HI>One</HI> only, the plain <HI>&s;cope</HI> of the <HI>Text,</HI> and what I de&s;igned in the Choice of it: Namely,</P>
<P>DOCT. <HI>That the People of God ought by Earne&s;t &amp; Fervent Prayer to be &s;eeking to Him for the Over|throw and De&s;truction of His and His Churches Enemies.</HI></P>
<P>PRAYER is our <HI>Duty,</HI> and our rich <HI>Priviledge</HI> in all Ca&s;es and Circum&s;tances what&s;oever. We <HI>owe</HI> this to God, and His Honour calls for it; we <HI>need</HI> it our &s;elves, and 'tis an un&s;peakable Favour, Mercy and Advantage to us. The Command is, Eph. 6.18. <HI>Pray always with all Prayer, &amp; Supplication in the Spirit, watching there|unto with all per&s;everance:</HI> Phil. 4.6. <HI>In every thing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> Prayer and Supplication with Thanksgiving, let your Reque&s;ts be made known unto God.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis what the <HI>Saints</HI> have always <HI>abounded</HI> in: from <HI>Abraham</HI> to <HI>David,</HI> from <HI>David</HI> to <HI>Elias,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="001294_0009_0FB27C0E8ED19058">from Him to <HI>Daniel, &amp;c.</HI> And above all out <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour</HI> has taught it to his Church for ever, both in repeated <HI>Precepts</HI> and his own Heavenly <HI>Practice.</HI> A mo&s;t Rea&s;onable Duty to the Great <HI>God</HI> and our Merciful <HI>Redeemer!</HI> Who&s;e we are, Who gave us Being, in whom we live, on whom we depend, from whom we receive all that we have, all that we can have, &amp; more than we know of!

To whom we are by our <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> devoted and con&s;ecrated, being bought with a <HI>Price,</HI> the <HI>precious Blood of Chri&s;t,</HI> who al&s;o is our <HI>Advocate,</HI> and ever lives to pre&s;ent our Prayers.</P>
<P><HI>Prayer</HI> is the lea&s;t <HI>Acknowledgment</HI> that can be of God, his Providence, his Written Word, and all Spiritual Ble&s;&s;ings in <HI>Chri&s;t;</HI> and the lea&s;t <HI>Te&s;timony</HI> we can give of a Religious Reverence &amp; Veneration toward Him; of Gratitude, Love, Tru&s;t and Submi&s;&s;ion to Him; and &s;urely there can be no more meet and proper, or Nobler U&s;e of <HI>Speech,</HI> which Faculty is given us for this End, to utter aloud the devout Motions &amp; Re|&s;entments of our Minds, in way of Homage to the Great GOD, and for His Honour &amp; Glory.</P>
<P>Moreover, <HI>Fervency</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Rom. 8.26, Col. 4.12. St. Luk. 22.44. 1 The&s;. 3.10.</NOTE> mu&s;t accompany all our Prayers, if we expect they &s;hou'd be acceptable and Prevalent. St. <HI>James</HI> puts the&s;e two toge|ther,

This is but decent and nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e the <HI>Object</HI> to whom we addre&s;s in Prayer is the Mo&s;t <HI>High</HI> and <HI>Holy</HI> GOD, who&s;e Name is <HI>Glo|rious and Fearful,</HI> and before whom the <HI>Serephims cover their Faces!</HI> Tis an awful thing to have to do with the Supream <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> of Heaven and Earth! we &s;hou'd not dare to trifle with Him! Moreover, The <HI>things we ask</HI> in Prayer are of the la&s;t <HI>Weight and Importance,</HI> and if we have a pre&s;&s;ing &s;en&s;e of our <HI>Needs,</HI> and a real <HI>De&s;ire</HI> of the Ble&s;&s;ings we reque&s;t, we cannot but be ear|ne&s;t and &s;ervent in Spirit. In a word, Prayer is a Sacred Exerci&s;e of great &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and &s;o|lemnity, and nothing can be more Indecent &amp; Criminal than a light and common, a cold and indifferent frame of Spirit in it; But the Mind ought to be Intent, De&s;ire Strong, the Affections vigorou&s;ly moving, Grace in its lively Exerci&s;e, and then (like <HI>I&s;rael</HI>) we <HI>Wre&s;tle</HI> with God and <HI>as a Prince</HI> we do <HI>prevail.</HI></P>
<P>This I cou'd not but hint of <HI>Prayer in General,</HI> and now have the &s;ame thing to ob&s;erve and make good of that particular <HI>Branch</HI> of Prayer, the <HI>Imprecation</HI> of Judgment upon the Enemies of God.

<P>Nor can it be &s;aid, that the&s;e Prayers do not <HI>agree to the Spirit of Chri&s;tianity.</HI> They did agree to the Unequal'd Meekne&s;s of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> &amp; to the exalted Devotion of <HI>David:</HI> Nay they do agree

<P>But you will expect that I do both <HI>&s;tate and limit</HI> this point, and then offer &s;omething in <HI>Proof</HI> of it. Take then a few <HI>Rules</HI> about pray|ing again&s;t others, even the mo&s;t wicked Ene|mies of God, and then a few <HI>Rea&s;ons</HI> to prove it to be lawful, decent and nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>The Rules,</HI> which we ought to govern our &s;elves by in this Ca&s;e, are &s;uch as the&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. We mu&s;t be &s;ure that we do <HI>&s;imply con&s;ider 'em as Gods Enemies and not our Own,</HI> and that there be no private Grudge on per&s;onal accounts. For this wou'd &s;poil our Prayers, and be an Asking God to gratify our private <HI>Spleens,</HI> which he abominates in us. Therefore we mu&s;t na|kedly confider tho&s;e, whom we pray again&s;t,
<PB N="11" REF="001294_0013_0FB27C174CFC3FD0">as the Publick Enemies of Gods Truth and Ho|ly Religion.</P>
<P N="2">2. We mu&s;t therefore <HI>be &s;ure that we can prove 'em to be &s;o,</HI> before we venture to pray again&s;t 'em. This will put re&s;traint upon a <HI>ha&s;ty Zeal,</HI> which is apt to mi&s;take, and to judge them whom Chri&s;t receives.

II. <HI>Here is a Serious and Affectionate Call to Prayer, for our People, and Churches, and for the In|tere&s;t of Chri&s;t in the World.</HI> For what is it to Pray again&s;t the Church's Enemies, but to be lifting up a Prayer for the Church it &s;elf? 'Tis in effect the &s;ame thing, and they are mutually imply'd in each other. The &s;ame Rea&s;ons and Argu|ments incite equally to either, and therefore the proper <HI>Inference</HI> &amp; <HI>Exhortation</HI> from the preceding <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> is this, <HI>Pray for the Peace of Jeru&s;alem!</HI> P&s;al. 122.7, 8, 9. <HI>Peace be within thy Walls, and Pro&s;perity within thy Palaces. For my Brethren and Companions &s;ake I will now &s;ay, Peace be within thee. Becau&s;e of the Hou&s;e of the Lord our God, I will &s;eek thy Good.</HI> So in the &s;ame Breath wherein the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI> prayes, <HI>Remember,</HI> O <HI>Lord, the Children of Edom,</HI> he took &s;pecial care him&s;elf not to for|get <HI>Jeru&s;alem, If I forget thee, O Jeru&s;alem, let my right hand forget her Cunning: If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jeru&s;alem above my chief Joy.</HI></P>
<P>Millions of Prayers are daily going up to God from his Church, in every part of the World, a|gain&s;t his Enemies; and &s;uch hands as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> held up High and Steadily in the <HI>Mount,</HI> and hearts like his breathing out <HI>this Short Petition,</HI> wou'd utterly &s;catter every <HI>Amaleck,</HI> and put the Haters of the Lord to a perpetual Rout. God has fulfill'd his gracious <HI>Promi&s;e,</HI> and has &s;et <HI>Watchmen upon Jeru|&s;alems Walls, who do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> hold their Peace, day nor night:</HI> I&s;a. 62.6, 7. <HI>Ye that make mention of the

<P N="3">III. <HI>Salvations receiv'd &s;hou'd be lookt upon at An&s;wers given unto Prayer, and demand Returns of Solemn Prai&s;e and Thanksgiving.</HI> When God has <HI>Ri&s;en</HI> up and &s;mote his Enemies, our Prayers a|gain&s;t them are An&s;wer'd, our Petition is given us; as indeed of late years the Church's Prayers have been mo&s;t &s;ignally, <HI>in a Series of great Succe&s;&s;es and wonderful Victories</HI> over the <HI>Powers</HI> of the <HI>Bea&s;t;</HI> and I need look no further than our <HI>Con|text</HI> for the proper Acknowledgments &amp; Thank|ful Prai&s;es, which &s;uch gracious An&s;wers of Pray|er &s;hou'd con&s;train from us: v. 11, 12. <HI>The Lord gave the Word, Great was the Company of tho&s;e that Publi&s;h'd it.

A&s;cribe ye &s;trength unto God: His Excellency is over I&s;rael, and His &s;trength is in the Clouds. O God, thou art Terrible out of thy holy Places: the God of I&s;rael is he that giveth &s;trength and power unto his People: Ble&s;&s;ed be God.</HI></P>

IV. If we may Pray again&s;t the Enemies of God and his Church, for their Overthrow and De&s;truction, <HI>Then al&s;o we may Seek and Endeavour their ruin and downfal in</HI> LAWFUL WAR. 'Tis you &s;ee what we can Pray over, and may tru&s;t in God for his Ble&s;&s;ing on. For tho' Chri&s;tiani|ty abhors the Principle of Propagating the Truth by Force of Arms; or of making War on others becau&s;e they are the avowed Enemies of God &amp; his Church; yet if thro' the over-ruling Provi|dence of God we come to be in a ju&s;t War with &s;uch, we may the more confidently hope that God will make it Sub&s;erve to his own Glory in their Overthrow, and we can plead before Him, that they are <HI>His Enemies,</HI> and Pray that He wou'd <HI>Ari&s;e and Scatter 'em.</HI></P>
<P>This gives the GOVERNMENT Confidence in their <HI>Councels</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Enemy,</HI> and heartens the Chri&s;tian <HI>Souldiers</HI> in their <HI>Marches</HI> and <HI>En|gagements;</HI> to be <HI>Strong</HI> and to <HI>Play the Men,</HI> for the People and Cities of their God; for as many Prayers are following 'em, So who knows what <HI>Arms</HI> God will u&s;e for the Fall of the <HI>Man of Sin,</HI> again&s;t whom &s;o many Prayers are continually a&s;cending.
