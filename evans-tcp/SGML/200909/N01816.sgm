<P>IT is known to tho&s;e few in the World, who have any knowledge of &s;o ob&s;cure &amp; incon|&s;iderable a Per&s;on as I am, that in my Judg|ment I am for the <HI>Congregational Church-Di&s;|cipline,</HI> as it is in the <HI>New-England Platform</HI> declared. Which is no Abatement unto my great E&s;teem &amp; Honour, for our Brethren of the <HI>Pre&s;|byterian</HI> Pe&s;wa&s;ion; among whom <HI>I</HI> know, there have been as Pious and Learned Per&s;ons, not only in <HI>England</HI> &amp; <HI>Scotland,</HI> but al&s;o in <HI>Hol|land, France, Geneva, &amp; Switzerland,</HI> &amp; el&s;e|where, as any whom the World hath known.

The De&s;ign of our pre&s;ent Action being partly to do a Ju&s;tice unto the Reputation of Churches, the <HI>Managements</HI> as well as <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> whereof &s;hould be <HI>the Glory of CHRIST,</HI> and partly, to make an offer of what may be of &s;ome u&s;e, to direct their Steps on <HI>recurring Occa&s;ions</HI> that may ari&s;e of no little Con&s;equence to their Tran|quillity; we may Comfortably Ask and Hope for the Ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven upon it.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> THE fir&s;t Ca&s;e that at this Time calls for our Con&s;ideration, is, <HI>The Relea&s;e of a Pa&s;tor from the Solemn Charge of a Congrega|tion, which he has taken upon him.</HI> Upon this there have been once and again Publi&s;hed, &s;ome <HI>Determinations,</HI> which have been En|tertained without Exception in our Chur|ches; From whence, (without Repeating the Cau&s;es of a <HI>Removal</HI> there allowed of) we tran&s;cribe the&s;e words, as Expre&s;&s;ive of what we would have ever to be thought upon. [<HI>Thirty Ca&s;es.</HI>]
<Q>A <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> &s;ettled in the Service of a <HI>People,</HI> is to be &s;o &s;en&s;i|ble of his <HI>De&s;ignation</HI> by the Spirit &amp; Pro|vidence of the Lord JESUS CHRIST for that Service, and of the <HI>Account</HI> that he
<PB N="3" REF="002149_0006_0FBCBDE158562210">mu&s;t give unto GOD about his Behaviour in it, that his <HI>Removal</HI> mu&s;t not be ra&s;hly attempted, but with much Con&s;ideration, Con&s;ultation, Supplication, and Sincere De&s;ire to follow the Conduct of Heaven in it. The Frowns of GOD u&s;e to follow <HI>Re|moves,</HI> that have not &s;o been Regulated.</Q> <HI>Again</HI>
<Q>That the <HI>will</HI> of our Lord about the <HI>Removal</HI> of any <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> from his <HI>People</HI> may be under&s;tood, it is requi&s;ite, that the Mi|ni&s;ter do not entirely <HI>A&s;&s;ume to him&s;elf,</HI> the Judgment of his own Call to Remove, but a Great Regard mu&s;t be had unto the Di|rection of the Churches of our Lord, in the Neighbourhood. <HI>Once more.</HI> If much of <HI>Scandal</HI> will certainly en&s;ue upon the <HI>Re|moval</HI> of a <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> from his People, <HI>That</HI> &s;hould weigh down many Circum&s;tances that would rather invite it. <HI>And,</HI> It becomes not any Mini&s;ter, to <HI>Seek his own Tran&s;la|tion,</HI> by fir&s;t offering him&s;elf unto it.</Q> It is accordingly our Apprehen&s;ion, that &s;uch a <HI>Removal</HI> ought &s;till to be attended, at lea&s;t with Two Qualifications to Legitimate it, and render it Inoffen&s;ive unto the Chur|ches of GOD.</P>
<P N="1">Fir&s;t. IT is requi&s;ite, that the <HI>Rea&s;ons</HI> of the <HI>Removal</HI> be laid before <HI>Authentick Judges;</HI> even &s;uch as may be mo&s;t likely to pa&s;s an

For, if &s;uch a <HI>Council,</HI> be according to the <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Practice,</HI> of the&s;e Churches, always Convened, for the <HI>Ordaining</HI> of a <HI>Pa&s;tor,</HI> it &s;tands to Rea&s;on, that there &s;hould as much be requi&s;ite for his <HI>Removing;</HI> it being, as it was by a very con|fiderable Number of Eminent Divines on a Great Occa&s;ion in the&s;e Churches once pro|nounced, <HI>A very con&s;iderable Act of the Kingly Government Exerci&s;ed by our Lord JESUS CHRIST, in His Churches.</HI> Accordingly, a General <HI>Synod,</HI> in the Year 1662. have de|termined, That the <HI>Tran&s;lation of a Pa&s;tor,</HI> is a Point, wherein the <HI>Communion of Churches</HI> is to be Exerci&s;ed; and the chief way of <HI>Communion</HI> there Propounded, is Expre&s;sly that of <HI>Councils.</HI> And certainly &s;o Important an Affair will demand &s;uch a <HI>Cogni&s;ance.</HI> Wherefore, If a Mini&s;ter be upon a Removal from his Flook, e&s;pecially when there are no &s;ufficient Cau&s;es Evident for it, and the Flock Earne&s;tly Propound and Reque&s;t, that the thing may be laid before a <HI>Council</HI> of the

<P>Secondly. IT is requi&s;ite, that the <HI>Rea|&s;ons</HI> be found &s;uch as are Con&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>Solemn Vow,</HI> which a Per&s;on who receives the <HI>Pa&s;toral Charge</HI> of a Church, makes unto our Glorious LORD, for the <HI>&s;aithful Di&s;charge</HI> of his Mini&s;try, and the <HI>Labour &amp; Patience</HI> of One that mu&s;t <HI>give up an Account</HI> unto Him; and Con&s;i&s;tent with the fervent <HI>Love,</HI> which One that has the <HI>Pa&s;toral Charge</HI> of a Church, ought to bear unto his Flock; <HI>having them in his Heart,</HI> as the Servant of GOD &s;peaks. <HI>To Die and to Live with them.</HI> Very Plain are the Directions of that Word, which they Preach unto others; [Act.

V. 2.] <HI>To feed the flock of GOD, taking the Over&s;ight thereof, not by Con&s;traint, but willingly, and with a Ready Mind.</HI> And according hereunto, there can be nothing more &s;uitable for them, then that Language; [1 The&s; II. 8.] <HI>Being affectio|nately de&s;irous of you, we were <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">.

Nor may the Churches have <HI>Stumbling-blocks</HI> laid before them, to tempt them unto Hard or Mean Thoughts of the Mini&s;try from whence they Expect the <HI>Word of Truth,</HI> and the <HI>Go&s;pel of their Salvation.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> ANOTHER Ca&s;e that calls for our Con&s;ideration, is; <HI>How the Right of a Particu|lar Church to Chu&s;e their own Pa&s;tor, is to be Exerci&s;ed.</HI> Now herein we for ever adhere to the Sentiments, which we have &s;ome Years ago, declared in the&s;e Terms.
<Q>A Body of Chri&s;tians <HI>A&s;&s;ociated</HI> for all the Ordinances of the Go&s;pel, are a CHURCH of our Glo|rious LORD, which have among other precious Privileges, a <HI>Right</HI> from HIM, <HI>To Chu&s;e their own Pa&s;tors.</HI> The Churches which have Recovered this <HI>Right</HI> from <HI>the Oppre&s;&s;ion of Man,</HI> under which many Chur|ches
<PB N="7" REF="002149_0010_0FBCBDEDB42A3F80">of the Reformation are to this day groaning, ought to <HI>keep the Precepts</HI> and the <HI>Favours</HI> of the Lord, and not ea&s;ily part with what He has <HI>given them.</HI> NEVER|THELESS, A Church in the Exerci&s;e of this <HI>Right,</HI> ought in all po&s;&s;ible ways con|&s;i&s;tent therewithal, to con&s;ult the Edifica|tion and Satisfaction of their <HI>Neighbours;</HI> E&s;pecially tho&s;e, on who&s;e A&s;&s;i&s;tance to carry on their Affairs, they may have much Dependence. The Church ought &s;o to Manage their <HI>Choice,</HI> that if the Neigh|bours have any ju&s;t Di&s;&s;atisfaction, all the Re&s;pect required by <HI>Scripture</HI> and <HI>Rea&s;on,</HI> and <HI>Gratitude,</HI> may be paid unto it.</Q></P>
<P>And long before this In&s;trument, which was given &s;ome Years ago, it was declared in the well-known, <HI>Thirty Ca&s;es;</HI>
<Q>That a <HI>Particular Church</HI> owing a Great Regard unto the <HI>Church Catholick,</HI> in the u&s;ing of its own <HI>Right,</HI> is bound to Con&s;ult the Sa|tisfaction and Edification of <HI>Others,</HI> in their <HI>Election</HI> of a <HI>Pa&s;tor. And,</HI> That Churches in their <HI>Election</HI> of a <HI>Pa&s;tor,</HI> are to con&s;ider the Benefit of <HI>All</HI> that are to be his <HI>Hear|ers,</HI> and more particularly the Concurrence of &s;uch, as are by the <HI>Covenant</HI> and Ap|pointment of GOD, under the <HI>Church-Watch</HI> among them. <HI>And,</HI> That <HI>Churches</HI> may
<PB N="8" REF="002149_0011_0FBCBDF0DCDFF7C0">&s;uffer their <HI>Elections</HI> to be <HI>Directed,</HI> yea, and be <HI>Diverted,</HI> by Con&s;iderations, which they <HI>owe</HI> to others in the <HI>Vicinity,</HI> without Surrendring their <HI>Liberties</HI> to be Smothe|red by any that would unju&s;tly Impo&s;e thereupon.</Q></P>
<P>UNTO this, we now add our further De|claration, That a Church may be guilty of doing what is very <HI>Wrong,</HI> if they u&s;e the <HI>Right</HI> which they claim, in &s;uch a way, as to forget tho&s;e Indi&s;pen&s;able Maxims of our SAVIOUR. [Rom.XIV. 19.] <HI>Let us follow the things that make for Peace, &amp; things wherewith one may edify another.</HI> And, [2 Cor.XII. 26.] <HI>Let all Things be done to Edifying.</HI> And, [1 Pet. V. 5.] <HI>All of you be &s;ubject one to another.</HI> And, [Phil. II. 3.] <HI>Let nothing be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> through &s;trife; but in lowline&s;s of Mind, let <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> other better than them&s;elves.</HI> And therefore, if they be a <HI>Minor</HI> part of the Church, which are earne&s;tly &s;et again&s;t the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, which a <HI>Major</HI> part &s;hall make of a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">; but this <HI>Minor</HI> part are con&s;iderable by Number, and behave them&s;elves as <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Chri&s;tians,</HI> willing to have their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> determin'd by proper Judges, and have <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> a Plea of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> for their <HI>Di&s;&s;ent,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> appears they cannot without Sin, un|der
<PB N="9" REF="002149_0012_0FBCBDF1E53B47D0">their pre&s;ent Apprehen&s;ions, Acquie&s;ce in the Choice, and the Con&s;equences of it, the Church ought now to <HI>do nothing Ra&s;hly,</HI> but with convenient <HI>Pau&s;es,</HI> and with all due Methods for Satisfaction, <HI>Wait</HI> until it &s;hall plea&s;e GOD, that the <HI>Di&s;&s;atisfyed Bre|thren</HI> &s;hall have no cau&s;e to Complain of an <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ion</HI> upon them; E&s;pecially, when the condition of a Church, may be &s;uch, that their <HI>Immediate Proceeding</HI> unto a Settlement &s;hall not be ab&s;olutely Nece&s;&s;ary.</P>

<Q>Tho&s;e in the <HI>Congregational Way</HI> ac|knowledge, that they are bound in Con|&s;cience, to give Account of their Ways, to Churches about them: And that <HI>Synods</HI> are an Ordinance of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for the helping of the Church again&s;t Errors, Schi&s;ms, and Scandals.

<Q>That it is an <HI>holy Ordinance of CHRIST,</HI> for <HI>Particular Churches</HI> to joyn together, in a Con&s;ociation among them&s;elves, to ad|mini&s;ter their Church-affairs, which are of <HI>Weighty &amp; Difficult &amp; common concernment,</HI> not without common con&s;ultation, and con|&s;ent, of other Churches about them. Now Church-affairs of Weighty and Difficult, and common concernment, we account to be, the <HI>Election</HI> and <HI>Ordination of Elders, Excommunication</HI> of an <HI>Elder,</HI> or any <HI>per&s;on of Publick Note,</HI>&mdash;and Employment; the <HI>Tran&s;lation of an Elder</HI> from one Church to another.</Q> Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI>'s Survey, (Preface, <HI>p.</HI> 11.) ob&s;erves.
<Q><HI>Con&s;ociation</HI> of Churches
<PB N="13" REF="002149_0016_0FBCBDFB1DEF6038">is not only lawful, but in &s;ome ca&s;es nece&s;|ce&s;&s;ary. When cau&s;es are difficult &amp; parti|cular Churches want light and help, they &s;hould crave the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;uch a con&s;o|ciation. Churches &s;o meeting, have right to coun&s;el, rebuke, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as the ca&s;e doth re|quire. In ca&s;e any particular Church &s;hall walk pertinaciou&s;ly, either in the profe&s;&s;ion of Error, or &s;inful practice, and will not hear their coun&s;el, they may and &s;hould re|nounce the right hand of fellow&s;hip with them.</Q> Dr. <HI>Owen,</HI> in &s;everal of his Treati&s;es does advance Po&s;itions of the &s;ame A&s;pect on the Nece&s;&s;ity &amp; Authority of Regular <HI>Coun|cils,</HI> for the welfare of particular Churches. In one of his former, [Catech. p. 224.] he &s;ays,
<Q><HI>Churches</HI> ought to pre&s;erve a Mutual Holy communion, and Exerci&s;e it in making u&s;e of the Advice of one another. And in ca&s;e any Church give offence to other Chur|ches, other Churches may require an Ac|count from them. Admeni&s;h them of their Faults, &amp; withold Communion from them, in ca&s;e they per&s;i&s;t in the Error of their way; and that becau&s;e in their Difficulties, and before their Mi&s;carriages, they were bound to have de&s;ired the Advice of other Chur|ches; which being neglected by them, the other are to recover the End of it unto the
<PB N="14" REF="002149_0017_0FBCBE014D8833F0">utmo&s;t of their Ability.</Q> Thus Dr. <HI>Owen.</HI> And in one of his la&s;t, he has the&s;e Memorable words. [Nat. of Church. part 2. p. 251.]
<Q>No Church is &s;o <HI>Independent,</HI> as that it can always, and in all ca&s;es ob&s;erve the Duties it owes unto the Lord CHRIST, and the <HI>Church Catholick</HI> by all tho&s;e Powers, which it is able to act in it &s;elf di&s;tinctly, without Conjunction with others. And the Church that confines its Duty unto the <HI>Acts of its own A&s;&s;emblies,</HI> cuts it &s;elf off from the Ex|ternal Communion of the <HI>Church Catholick:</HI> nor will it be &s;afe for any Man to commit the conduct of his Soul to &s;uch a Church.&mdash; Every <HI>Particular Church</HI> which Extends not its Duty, beyond its own A&s;&s;emblies and Members, is fallen off from the principal End of its In&s;titution. And every Principle, Opinion, or Per&s;wa&s;ion, that inclines any Church to confine its Care &amp; Duty unto its own Edification only;</Q> &mdash; is <HI>Schi&s;matical.</HI> But <HI>Great has been the Army of them that have Publi&s;hed</HI> &s;uch Truths as the&s;e, whereof &s;ome|thing may be further &s;een in, <HI>The fir&s;t Prin|ciples</HI> of <HI>New-England,</HI> Printed in the Year 1675. Unto all which we may add, what our celebrated <HI>Norton,</HI> has in his <HI>La&s;t Sermons;</HI> Particularly, that pa&s;&s;age,
<Q>Let us acknow|ledge the Order of the Elder&s;hip in out
<PB N="15" REF="002149_0018_0FBCBE0265716B30">Churches, in their Way, and the Order of <HI>Councils</HI> in their Way, duely back'd &amp; En|couraged; without which, Experience will witne&s;s that the&s;e Churches cannot long con&s;i&s;t.</Q> Nor are the words of the worthy Mr. <HI>Samuel Danforth,</HI> (once Pa&s;tor of <HI>Roxbu|ry,</HI>) in his Election-Sermon, in the Year 1670. unworthy to be recited.
<Q>In our Fir&s;t and Be&s;t Times, what Pious Cate was there of Si&s;ter Churches, &mdash; that in tho&s;e that wanted Peace, their Di&s;&s;en&s;ions might be healed? What Readine&s;s was there in tho&s;e Days to call for the Help of Neigh|bour Elders &amp; Brethren in ca&s;e of any Dif|ference or Divi&s;ion that could not be healed at home? What Reverence was there then of the Sentence of a <HI>Council,</HI> as being <HI>Deci|cive,</HI> and i&s;&s;uing the Controver&s;y? Accor|ding to that Ancient Proverbial &s;aying, <HI>They &s;hall &s;urely ask Coun&s;el at Abel, and &s;o they Ended the Matter.</HI></Q></P>
<P>FROM whence, it will follow That if any of our Churches pre&s;ume to Tran&s;act their more <HI>Weighty Affairs,</HI> and &s;uch as are of a <HI>Common Concern</HI> to the Churches in their Neighbourhood, with a <HI>Contempt</HI> of &s;uch <HI>Councils</HI> of them as ought to be advi&s;ed with|al; or, if they &s;hall upon grievous Differences ari&s;en among them, refu&s;e the Advice of
<PB N="16" REF="002149_0019_0FBCBE084118A3C0">tho&s;e who urge them to make u&s;e of the Re|medy, which the want of <HI>Light</HI> &amp; <HI>Peace</HI> a|mong them calleth for: and much more, if they &s;hall proceed in Matters after the Neighbouring Churches have &s;ignified, that they cannot countenance their proceedings; tho&s;e Churches will be far from Expre&s;&s;ing the <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> which is <HI>with the well-advi&s;ed;</HI> and will greatly Sin again&s;t the Second and Third Commandment; and will practically go too far towards Excluding them&s;elves from Communion with the Churches of the Faithful. Indeed, the more <HI>Councils</HI> &amp; <HI>Sy|nods</HI> are di&s;regarded &amp; &s;lighted, &s;o much the more di&s;order and confu&s;ion will (we fear) grow &amp; prevail in all the Churches in the Country; which GOD of His Infinite Mercy prevent.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>IV.</HI> CONCERNING the Ca&s;e of <HI>Rein&s;tal|ling a Tran&s;lated Pa&s;tor,</HI> which may al&s;o call for &s;ome Con&s;ideration; we need only Re|port, what has been the <HI>Practice,</HI> of our Chur|ches, in tho&s;e very <HI>Few Examples,</HI> that have been <HI>mo&s;t generally approved</HI> of. The <HI>Pa&s;tor</HI> having been (with the Advice of a <HI>Council</HI>) Regularly <HI>Relea&s;ed,</HI> and then <HI>Di&s;mi&s;&s;ed,</HI> from the Church where to he has been Related, the Church, whereto he has been upon a Tran&s;|lation,

But yet a <HI>Charge</HI> has been u&s;ed to be given by the Moderator, for the faithful Di&s;charge of his Mini&s;try, <HI>in this Place;</HI> and <HI>&s;uitable Prayers</HI> accompany'd it; unto which has been added, <HI>The Right Hand of Fellow&s;hip,</HI> from the Churches. And indeed, All &s;uch Things ought for ever to be done <HI>Decently and in Order.</HI> And as we hear, Unbia&s;&s;ed Strangers coming among us, have &s;ometimes confe&s;&s;ed, <HI>That the mo&s;t Solemn Actions they have ever &s;een in their Lives, have been the Ordinations in the Churches of</HI> New-England; &s;o we cannot but wi&s;h, that they may never lo&s;e any thing of their Solemnity.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="002149_0021_0FBCBE0D2BA8A2C0">
To which end we find rea&s;on al&s;o to add our <HI>Te&s;timony</HI> again&s;t all Indecency and Ir|regularity in the Management of a Publick <HI>Di&s;&s;ent</HI> from and <HI>Oppo&s;ition</HI> unto the Ordina|tion or In&s;talment of a Pa&s;tor over a Flock, when&s;oever there may be Occa&s;ion for &s;o Melancholly an Action, which rarely hap|pens. We acknowledge the <HI>Right</HI> that every Chri&s;tian has, and much more, that any <HI>Num|ber</HI> of aggreived Brethren have, in an order|ly Manner to object and declare again&s;t the Ordination of a Mini&s;ter, or his Induction into the Pa&s;toral Office over a Particular Flock, when they apprehend Sufficient Rea|&s;ons for doing &s;o. But then Chri&s;tianity requires that this be done, when it becomes nece&s;&s;ary, with much Mode&s;ty &amp; Calmne&s;s, Meekne&s;s and Gravity, Wi&s;dom and Seriou&s;|ne&s;s; and not with a Noi&s;e, Wrath &amp; Bit|terne&s;s, Di&s;agreeable to &s;uch a Solemnity. Wherefore al&s;o, every Church ought very Carefully to avoid all Provocations, that may have a Tendency to drive things unto &s;uch Extremities; and therefore Sea&s;onably to hear, and duely to Con&s;ider, what the Di&s;&s;atisfied may have to offer.</P>

<PB N="19" REF="002149_0022_0FBCBE11241BE198">of our Churches, as <HI>Days of Temptation,</HI> and of <HI>Defection,</HI> may grow upon us.
